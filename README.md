# ScribeSalad 

In absence of searchable transcripts, many interesting YouTube videos, podcasts, lectures and talks are hard to explore, quote and summarize. **ScribeSalad** is an open data project regrouping over 110k YouTube video transcripts discussing social and political issues, psychology, history and scientific topics ranging from biology, mathematics to artificial intelligence : The Joe Rogan Experience, The Rubin Report, Jordan B. Peterson talks, Yale courses, MIT lectures and more. This project is a first step towards making great content more available and inspiring speakers, storytellers, interviewers and scientists better heard.

## Transcription quality 
Some of the transcriptions originate from YouTube (subtitles uploaded by the video's owner) while the rest are generated automatically using a high-accuracy large-vocabulary continuous speech recognition system (~90% of accuracy in clean conditions : no background noise, no heavy accents and good quality audio). 

## Filenames and formats 
The transcripts identified using the corresponding YouTube videos IDs and each one is available in three formats : text, vtt (Text Tracks Format) and srt (SubRip Subtitle Format).

To open the original video, replace "ID" in https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ID by the transcript filename. 

## Terms of use 
This is an open data project, feel free to fork this repository, download, share and use any of the transcripts. 


## TODO 
- **Cleaning-up transcripts :** removing fillers (hum, ah, etc) and repetitions.
- **Topic modeling :** automatically discovering the abstract "topics" that occur in a each transcript.
- **Speaker identification :** who spoken when ? and for how long ?
- **Creating a search engine :** exploring subjects by speaker, topic, channel, etc.
- **Multiligual transcripts :** Translating all transcripts to other languages.
- More channels & more videos.
