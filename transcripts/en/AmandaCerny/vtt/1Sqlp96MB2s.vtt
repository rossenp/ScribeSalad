00:00:01.020 --> 00:00:03.210
<v 0>For some reason for the past week,</v>

2
00:00:03.240 --> 00:00:08.120
I've been craving to go to where I'm from new England,

3
00:00:08.150 --> 00:00:11.030
Connecticut. I'm like, I just want to go back.

4
00:00:11.031 --> 00:00:15.260
I have memories and all these places in new England. And for some reason,

5
00:00:15.261 --> 00:00:18.500
deep down in my soul, I just want to go there.

6
00:00:22.490 --> 00:00:24.320
How did we live here? So cold.

7
00:00:35.210 --> 00:00:36.043
<v 1>[Inaudible].</v>

8
00:00:43.940 --> 00:00:48.110
<v 0>Going one way ticket. I'm going to Connecticut.</v>

9
00:00:48.140 --> 00:00:50.210
And then who knows?

10
00:00:52.280 --> 00:00:56.300
So the plan is I'm going to fly to Connecticut.

11
00:00:56.510 --> 00:00:57.680
I'm going to get a rental car.

12
00:00:58.100 --> 00:01:01.880
I'm going to drive to the old neighborhood of where I'm from.

13
00:01:01.881 --> 00:01:06.770
And I grew up and I had some of the best memories ever from there because

14
00:01:06.771 --> 00:01:11.360
that's when I was a little girl and my mind was so creative.

15
00:01:11.420 --> 00:01:14.900
I am flying tomorrow morning and then booking my blank now.

16
00:01:18.770 --> 00:01:19.603
<v 1>Hello.</v>

17
00:01:22.460 --> 00:01:23.810
<v 0>My sister just called me.</v>

18
00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:26.270
I'm looking at flights on the planes to see if she can meet me.

19
00:01:38.540 --> 00:01:39.230
<v 1>[Inaudible].</v>

20
00:01:39.230 --> 00:01:44.060
<v 0>This is insane that I'm hearing now. So weird.</v>

21
00:01:44.390 --> 00:01:47.180
You go to sleep in one city. You wake up in another,

22
00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:53.120
literally tastes like I'm drinking. A donut, never have sugar like this anymore,

23
00:01:53.121 --> 00:01:54.170
but woo.

24
00:02:00.320 --> 00:02:00.770
<v 1>[Inaudible].</v>

25
00:02:00.770 --> 00:02:04.850
<v 0>First off Apple store. And I have to try to fight my hardest,</v>

26
00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:09.080
not to go to my neighborhood, to the karate school,

27
00:02:09.081 --> 00:02:11.990
to anything yet until my sister arrives tomorrow.

28
00:02:19.520 --> 00:02:22.820
I need to find a hotel ASAP because I'm terrified of driving in the South.

29
00:02:24.340 --> 00:02:26.060
I haven't found a place to stay yet.

30
00:02:27.140 --> 00:02:29.810
Probably the best room they have that they're showing the pictures up,

31
00:02:29.990 --> 00:02:34.970
but I'll take it quick change.

32
00:02:35.390 --> 00:02:38.930
I'm actually just going to take a sneak peek at the old neighborhood,

33
00:02:39.020 --> 00:02:41.270
I guess where I am.

34
00:02:44.930 --> 00:02:49.280
Yeah. Okay. You can't see it, but that's my house.

35
00:02:49.281 --> 00:02:50.600
I'm going to have to show you tomorrow.

36
00:02:50.730 --> 00:02:53.420
Looks exactly the same just without all your gardens.

37
00:02:56.960 --> 00:03:01.540
Definitely look really creepy right outside of people's houses. Okay.

38
00:03:01.570 --> 00:03:02.403
I got to move

39
00:03:13.480 --> 00:03:14.313
[inaudible]

40
00:03:16.080 --> 00:03:20.550
I just need it so hard to break it then. God. Ooh.

41
00:03:22.170 --> 00:03:24.240
We're good. Good day.

42
00:03:37.950 --> 00:03:42.720
[inaudible] street. This is our old house.

43
00:03:43.350 --> 00:03:45.630
Crazy. That is crazy. That's

44
00:04:03.180 --> 00:04:04.800
for like 10 years growing up.

45
00:04:08.580 --> 00:04:09.960
Do you mind if we walk around the yard?

46
00:04:58.410 --> 00:05:00.660
[inaudible] you're so sweet. That's so cool.

47
00:05:21.540 --> 00:05:22.373
[inaudible]

48
00:05:28.320 --> 00:05:32.460
it's so crazy. It's so different is from 1906 that you

49
00:05:34.860 --> 00:05:36.510
turned into karate school.

50
00:05:41.630 --> 00:05:45.300
Another thing, right there used to be where the diner was there.

51
00:05:45.301 --> 00:05:46.290
We used to have breakfast

52
00:05:57.930 --> 00:05:58.763
[inaudible].

53
00:06:22.500 --> 00:06:23.333
<v 1>[Inaudible]</v>

54
00:06:28.580 --> 00:06:32.600
not taking the playground and we're like crazy.

55
00:06:33.140 --> 00:06:36.020
Yeah, yeah.

56
00:06:39.860 --> 00:06:41.050
Everything. Oh

57
00:06:44.990 --> 00:06:49.130
my God. This is crazy. Hi. Sorry.

58
00:06:50.180 --> 00:06:52.760
How are you? What's your name?

59
00:06:57.500 --> 00:07:01.700
Oh my God. Oh, sorry. Amanda. Sony and Samsung. Sony.

60
00:07:03.530 --> 00:07:06.860
Yeah. I'm so happy. We saw you in here. Do you remember doing these

61
00:07:17.120 --> 00:07:21.500
[inaudible]? This is my seat. I sat here and did my wham tests.

62
00:07:21.590 --> 00:07:24.890
I was fastest funny.

63
00:07:25.340 --> 00:07:28.220
So we would run out of quarters to buy lunch.

64
00:07:28.280 --> 00:07:33.140
And Nancy mole night used to always hook us up and make sure

65
00:07:33.141 --> 00:07:35.660
we still ate. And she still does that.

66
00:07:44.390 --> 00:07:47.540
This mirror, this bathroom mirror has been here since I was in school,

67
00:07:47.541 --> 00:07:51.980
but I was like this. We've got to figure out what they need though.

68
00:07:52.430 --> 00:07:55.550
We're going to get them a new playground. Sam.

69
00:07:55.580 --> 00:07:59.690
I started a foundation a while ago and we were creating playgrounds at different

70
00:07:59.691 --> 00:08:03.470
places and it was Cerny. Play the play foundation.

71
00:08:06.620 --> 00:08:11.360
Good teachers, strong, strong motivation for helping the students.

72
00:08:11.420 --> 00:08:15.620
And honestly, they just need more funding East Windsor,

73
00:08:15.630 --> 00:08:16.463
middle school.

74
00:08:20.440 --> 00:08:22.870
<v 0>Your life solely depends on you.</v>

75
00:08:22.960 --> 00:08:27.070
And every decision that you make in life leads up to where you are.

76
00:08:27.160 --> 00:08:30.100
So if you want to get out there, if you want to get somewhere new,

77
00:08:30.850 --> 00:08:34.720
just get up and do it and commit and make it happen.

78
00:08:35.140 --> 00:08:39.910
It's all in your hands. And nothing is impossible. Oh,

79
00:08:39.911 --> 00:08:44.380
the nostalgia we're headed to Rhode Island and it's only an hour and a half

80
00:08:44.381 --> 00:08:47.500
drive. Live your life, go on an adventure.

81
00:08:48.970 --> 00:08:53.410
Don't forget the small places, small thing. So we made.

82
00:08:53.410 --> 00:08:58.260
<v 1>It to our hotel room. You got Nate helping us out. And what was the quote date?</v>

83
00:09:01.740 --> 00:09:02.700
That's the fact.

84
00:09:07.500 --> 00:09:09.270
And now massage

85
00:09:13.200 --> 00:09:14.033
first off.

86
00:09:15.380 --> 00:09:20.000
<v 0>Rhode Island TBD, stay tuned. Make sure you guys comment below,</v>

87
00:09:20.270 --> 00:09:24.230
let us know what you liked about the video and show us some live.

88
00:09:25.190 --> 00:09:28.940
And hopefully you guys get to travel to places you've never been before and just

89
00:09:28.941 --> 00:09:29.774
get up and do it.

90
00:09:33.110 --> 00:09:37.700
<v 2>I noticed the playground that I used to play on all the time and I</v>

91
00:09:37.701 --> 00:09:42.440
wanted to see if I would be able to help with installing a new

92
00:09:42.441 --> 00:09:43.880
playground into the school.

93
00:09:48.950 --> 00:09:48.950
<v 1>[Inaudible].</v>
