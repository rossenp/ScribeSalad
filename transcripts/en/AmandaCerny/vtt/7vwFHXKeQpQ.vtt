00:00:00.210 --> 00:00:03.510
<v 0>This is going to be like, what did you and Whitney do,</v>

2
00:00:03.970 --> 00:00:07.200
where you need Kleenexes up your nose? Hi guys.

3
00:00:07.440 --> 00:00:10.080
So we just finished our fist fight. I won

4
00:00:11.730 --> 00:00:12.930
all my blood.

5
00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:17.550
Just used to be a white t-shirt second nose bleed in my life.

6
00:00:17.580 --> 00:00:21.870
And when these beautiful home triggered it triggers,

7
00:00:22.290 --> 00:00:24.960
this is the first time we've actually got to hang out.

8
00:00:24.961 --> 00:00:28.890
One-on-one and I was expecting such a glamorous beautiful

9
00:00:28.891 --> 00:00:33.840
Swan. I'm excited. We're going to be doing,

10
00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:35.340
um, beauty treatment.

11
00:00:35.400 --> 00:00:40.050
Obviously this is perfect for me to die a full face of

12
00:00:40.051 --> 00:00:44.760
makeup. As I apply a face mask to my face, um,

13
00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:49.140
it took like a many tools to apply the layers of

14
00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:54.090
shackle Schlack on my face. It looks great though. It makes me want to sneeze.

15
00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:59.250
If you use any subplot everywhere and it's like, Oh,

16
00:00:59.251 --> 00:01:04.230
you a new towel, but I think there'll be okay. Okay. Do you need his knees?

17
00:01:04.950 --> 00:01:09.420
Uh, all blur this out. Oh, Oh, it's fine. We're good.

18
00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:13.770
If it gets worse, we'll get you a light flow tampon.

19
00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:18.120
That won't be the only place I have one right now. So I have a super,

20
00:01:18.510 --> 00:01:22.680
I thought I was going to be the crass one in this video I'm used to being the

21
00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:25.770
crass one. The sad thing is I don't even know what that means.

22
00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:31.320
It's everything you're doing. You are the embodiment.

23
00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:36.150
I like how I asked Whitney for water earlier and she brought me flavored

24
00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:39.930
sparkling Pellegrino. That's fancy.

25
00:01:39.931 --> 00:01:44.040
And they brought me wine. Oh, wait, I brought her wine.

26
00:01:44.041 --> 00:01:48.840
And then she gave me a gift because she felt obligated because I gave her a

27
00:01:49.230 --> 00:01:52.170
gift. And then she gave me another guest. So one of my guests on top.

28
00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:56.070
So you gave me a wine opener and a candle that I liked that smelled good.

29
00:01:56.220 --> 00:01:59.400
And then you started hemorrhaging from the face? Yeah,

30
00:02:00.330 --> 00:02:05.250
I was over my mind was blown by the wine opener that she showed

31
00:02:05.251 --> 00:02:09.000
me. So I'm really concerned about this. You,

32
00:02:09.030 --> 00:02:13.050
I showed you generosity in your mind. Exploded and you just started bleeding.

33
00:02:13.110 --> 00:02:16.650
I've been in LA for too long. I know. We need to get you some nicer friends.

34
00:02:17.010 --> 00:02:21.570
Yeah. Well now I know where you live. Yeah. You just follow the trail of blood.

35
00:02:22.060 --> 00:02:25.590
Yeah. I feel like we really are becoming friends. I think so. I think you're,

36
00:02:26.300 --> 00:02:31.040
um, me, I thought you were gonna say, I mean, and I was like, Oh. I like,

37
00:02:31.100 --> 00:02:34.430
I got tricked into a call-out video. No, no, no. It's not live.

38
00:02:34.460 --> 00:02:38.570
It's on a camera. I know. It's your kid. You could tackle me.

39
00:02:38.720 --> 00:02:41.970
Delete it from my camera. I can't have you covered in blood,

40
00:02:42.060 --> 00:02:43.190
but just slippery piece of shoe.

41
00:02:43.570 --> 00:02:47.540
But we're the only ones here in the middle of fields and mountains. No,

42
00:02:47.541 --> 00:02:51.460
but you gave me wine. I couldn't catch ya. And that's what you got me all over,

43
00:02:51.500 --> 00:02:55.880
down liquor up. I'm too groggy strategy.

44
00:02:55.940 --> 00:02:59.560
But I do feel like I'm you a little bit. If you're me then I'm you. Yeah.

45
00:02:59.590 --> 00:03:02.920
I'm like you just less bloody. Yeah. Which is great.

46
00:03:02.921 --> 00:03:07.920
You're like the better me than you're saying the bloodless, you know? No.

47
00:03:07.940 --> 00:03:12.600
Even have the same top bun cuter. We use a smoother, you're like the better.

48
00:03:13.190 --> 00:03:17.010
I mean, you're like, um, we're like the before and after mugshot. Okay.

49
00:03:17.070 --> 00:03:19.350
Now we're being nice. This is like,

50
00:03:19.410 --> 00:03:22.620
this is the mugshot for shoplifting.

51
00:03:22.920 --> 00:03:25.500
And this is the mugshot for lighting caught. Shop

52
00:03:27.070 --> 00:03:30.000
the viewers know fully the third wheel on a first day.

53
00:03:31.680 --> 00:03:33.240
Video is not going to do well at all.

54
00:03:35.910 --> 00:03:39.600
Everybody's going to hate it and never want to sit down. Okay.

55
00:03:39.601 --> 00:03:44.100
Let's get some thumbs up masks cleanse face and dry face before using

56
00:03:44.130 --> 00:03:47.520
done called out for that.

57
00:03:47.521 --> 00:03:50.250
I know people get called out for lying and saying, they're not wearing makeup,

58
00:03:50.490 --> 00:03:51.540
but we actually aren't.

59
00:03:51.630 --> 00:03:56.490
I am wearing a full face of literal shoe called can I

60
00:03:56.491 --> 00:03:58.590
use your nose, blood,

61
00:03:59.880 --> 00:04:03.900
just have me over here and bottle my blood and then sell it as your new makeup

62
00:04:03.901 --> 00:04:05.820
line. I think that'd be a hit, bring blood

63
00:04:08.850 --> 00:04:11.520
[inaudible] compliments from lawyers actually. And they're like, Oh,

64
00:04:11.521 --> 00:04:15.330
you should be a lawyer. So maybe really they're flirting with you.

65
00:04:17.720 --> 00:04:18.720
And our elbows are no touching.

66
00:04:22.200 --> 00:04:26.700
I don't know who's going to move the elbow. This is like a game of chicken.

67
00:04:26.790 --> 00:04:29.700
Then I'll play all day long pretending to read this back.

68
00:04:29.701 --> 00:04:32.640
Like we're starting at when he hasn't let me, um,

69
00:04:32.700 --> 00:04:37.620
whoever moves the elbow first is pulling away from this relationship. Yeah.

70
00:04:37.680 --> 00:04:40.710
And you're the reason why he doesn't work out. Whoever pulls away as the, uh,

71
00:04:40.740 --> 00:04:43.290
by the way, Whitney canceled on me. Like

72
00:04:48.570 --> 00:04:51.590
[inaudible], we've rescheduled a couple times.

73
00:04:51.830 --> 00:04:53.940
Don't how she, um,

74
00:04:54.630 --> 00:04:58.830
I like how she rephrased the canceled rescheduling. Okay.

75
00:04:58.860 --> 00:05:02.670
And I completely understand reschedulings but I get it.

76
00:05:02.700 --> 00:05:07.680
And I just wanted to say, when you did that to me, text messages,

77
00:05:07.681 --> 00:05:11.700
didn't go on for too long, only six months. But I stayed strong. I was like,

78
00:05:11.730 --> 00:05:14.010
all right, tell me when you have been any,

79
00:05:14.011 --> 00:05:17.040
what time what's your address?

80
00:05:17.070 --> 00:05:21.920
You have been in Florida. This is true for a while to be fair,

81
00:05:21.960 --> 00:05:23.460
free Florida. Ah, sorry.

82
00:05:23.461 --> 00:05:25.650
Half of this conversation is us talking about our ovaries.

83
00:05:26.950 --> 00:05:29.070
[inaudible] to be exact. I'd been bleeding from everywhere.

84
00:05:29.640 --> 00:05:32.550
So those of you that are curious, Amanda loves the voice memo.

85
00:05:33.480 --> 00:05:36.900
She loves the voice memo and they put a lot of effort into them.

86
00:05:37.140 --> 00:05:39.600
It's not my first take three voice memos in a row.

87
00:05:39.810 --> 00:05:41.820
Not in a wait for your response. Just going to record.

88
00:05:41.830 --> 00:05:42.990
And then I'm just going to get ahead of it.

89
00:05:42.991 --> 00:05:46.080
I already know what you're going to say. I need to work on my patience. Yeah.

90
00:05:46.390 --> 00:05:47.850
You didn't even listen to that.

91
00:05:56.610 --> 00:06:01.130
Oh, he made it relatable to you. Oh,

92
00:06:02.060 --> 00:06:05.080
okay. Okay. This is a reschedule. This is annoying.

93
00:06:05.081 --> 00:06:08.200
I'm shooting this thing for Spotify. They're now moving it to the afternoon.

94
00:06:08.760 --> 00:06:13.540
I said, I swear, I'm not this much of a flake. And she realized it.

95
00:06:13.660 --> 00:06:15.040
I realized dad,

96
00:06:18.490 --> 00:06:22.990
no worries, six time. But then she said,

97
00:06:22.991 --> 00:06:26.200
I'll be in Florida. So then she was in Florida. That was me telling her,

98
00:06:26.201 --> 00:06:29.530
you missed your chance here, girl. I'm in Florida.

99
00:06:29.531 --> 00:06:32.260
Now this has been going on for a while. Also.

100
00:06:32.261 --> 00:06:34.540
Another thing about Amanda that you guys should know,

101
00:06:34.720 --> 00:06:39.460
she puts a space at the end of her sentences before punctuation

102
00:06:39.461 --> 00:06:44.140
punctuation. It's a Spanish keyboard.

103
00:06:44.620 --> 00:06:49.510
That's a psychopath. I all blame auto-corrects. I hope everything is okay.

104
00:06:49.511 --> 00:06:53.710
Space. Exclamation, Mark. Exclamation, Mark. Look at this. Why do I do that?

105
00:06:54.940 --> 00:06:55.773
Period?

106
00:06:55.990 --> 00:07:00.160
I know November 15th of last year,

107
00:07:00.280 --> 00:07:01.570
a picture of the mask.

108
00:07:01.600 --> 00:07:04.840
I think I'm going to edit this video down and then just keep rescheduling it.

109
00:07:05.290 --> 00:07:09.070
Yeah. Cleanse and dry face before. Now that

110
00:07:11.110 --> 00:07:15.460
time. Wow. Okay. Let me get you in the gym.

111
00:07:15.970 --> 00:07:19.330
Maybe do some tricks. Suspect, intense tightening sensation.

112
00:07:19.331 --> 00:07:24.130
Should I put this on my life?

113
00:07:24.131 --> 00:07:26.650
Hack slide, close to under eye area.

114
00:07:26.651 --> 00:07:30.280
You made experienced gradual pulling effects. Don't be alarmed.

115
00:07:30.310 --> 00:07:33.370
Don't be alarmed to. Upwards to lift cat.

116
00:07:34.510 --> 00:07:39.340
How old is this crusted?

117
00:07:39.341 --> 00:07:42.580
Over plume of dust.

118
00:07:43.540 --> 00:07:47.890
Don't make your teeth. They got it. No. Okay. That's done then. No,

119
00:07:47.920 --> 00:07:51.730
we do that. You know what I mean? I don't know how to explain what I just did.

120
00:07:51.731 --> 00:07:55.600
It's like peeling all the metal online. Do you want me to do it? Yeah. Oh,

121
00:07:55.630 --> 00:07:57.910
I didn't expect you to take me up on that. And you're mad at me.

122
00:07:58.090 --> 00:08:01.420
Are you typing very me too. Yeah. I can tell

123
00:08:02.950 --> 00:08:06.010
by how well you organize your resentment towards me.

124
00:08:06.610 --> 00:08:09.790
If you know I'm typing, when you reschedule on me, I know

125
00:08:12.820 --> 00:08:15.250
[inaudible]. If there wasn't a pandemic, it would have been a little different.

126
00:08:16.120 --> 00:08:20.290
Yeah. You're going to use COVID as your cause. I have like a good six months.

127
00:08:20.440 --> 00:08:24.880
Okay. There. Okay. There's my empathy. Yeah.

128
00:08:24.910 --> 00:08:29.380
I would say that was a raw there's my empathy.

129
00:08:29.381 --> 00:08:33.190
There was my empathy for you. Excuse me. Wait. Okay.

130
00:08:33.220 --> 00:08:36.700
We both have these out now. See, I actually am type a,

131
00:08:36.730 --> 00:08:41.330
I really do want to get this right. You're a robot.

132
00:08:43.240 --> 00:08:43.540
Um,

133
00:08:43.540 --> 00:08:46.480
you know those balloons in front of car dealerships that start low and then they

134
00:08:46.481 --> 00:08:50.590
go up. Just let me know if my notes pop this off.

135
00:08:51.160 --> 00:08:52.960
I think if her nose starts bleeding,

136
00:08:52.990 --> 00:08:55.890
I'm not going to tell her I'm on your guys aside. I'm going to let it bleed.

137
00:08:55.891 --> 00:08:58.230
And it's going to be amazing. I promise not to tell her.

138
00:08:58.470 --> 00:09:01.020
I've never seen my nose bleed. You're welcome.

139
00:09:01.290 --> 00:09:04.890
Lubricant poor for all the ways.

140
00:09:09.840 --> 00:09:11.280
It's been a while for Whitney guys.

141
00:09:20.780 --> 00:09:23.400
[inaudible] real people talk. I'm not a beauty influencer.

142
00:09:25.260 --> 00:09:29.310
So I do not think you just fine. Your blood is all over my floor.

143
00:09:29.760 --> 00:09:33.120
It's honestly the least gross thing that has come out of your body in my house.

144
00:09:33.990 --> 00:09:38.820
Okay. But you know, and then we going really slow. I know I'm really am,

145
00:09:38.821 --> 00:09:43.140
but I know. I know. I know I'm not a bad idea. I mean,

146
00:09:43.590 --> 00:09:46.890
I know, but you skid star, you, you stay in your lane

147
00:09:48.470 --> 00:09:52.080
and you could do better at this. You are typing eight,

148
00:09:53.010 --> 00:09:57.540
nine, 10, 10 seconds behind me. I know that's a good thing.

149
00:09:57.541 --> 00:10:00.510
We put a towel here. Well thought out on your end. I'll give you that.

150
00:10:00.570 --> 00:10:04.650
Thank you. I appreciate that. We have the same table and the same dresser.

151
00:10:05.040 --> 00:10:06.960
I feel like we're we do,

152
00:10:07.530 --> 00:10:09.960
but I feel like I should paint yours with yours because I feel like yours is

153
00:10:09.961 --> 00:10:12.180
better. Yeah. You know what I mean?

154
00:10:13.890 --> 00:10:18.630
That's not minimize facial movements to McAfee,

155
00:10:18.880 --> 00:10:22.350
my challenge or a robot. This will be easy for you. Swivel. Get that swollen.

156
00:10:22.380 --> 00:10:24.630
Oh my God. You are.

157
00:10:26.310 --> 00:10:29.310
If you avoiding the chair. Well, I it's fine.

158
00:10:29.480 --> 00:10:31.290
It'll cover up the blood from your nose.

159
00:10:32.580 --> 00:10:36.990
It's great makeup remover as well. It's all coming off.

160
00:10:41.550 --> 00:10:46.490
[inaudible] do I look like I'm

161
00:10:55.370 --> 00:10:58.190
[inaudible] with your face? I do not want to, if this,

162
00:10:58.250 --> 00:11:01.550
I would rather take one for the, I posted a photo with, um,

163
00:11:01.570 --> 00:11:05.210
out makeup before and people were shocked. So that's fine. What happened?

164
00:11:05.720 --> 00:11:10.370
You should wear makeup. No, they did it. No, it's fine. It's the internet.

165
00:11:11.570 --> 00:11:13.300
Yeah, that's just flirting. Okay.

166
00:11:16.160 --> 00:11:20.810
She catches it with her boots thing. Is it landed on your towel?

167
00:11:20.811 --> 00:11:25.730
And then you put your boobs on. I'm just trying to, I'm just trying to make, Oh,

168
00:11:25.760 --> 00:11:29.030
entice your audience over to my Instagram.

169
00:11:30.020 --> 00:11:34.340
Even on my Instagram. I really have, after we met,

170
00:11:34.790 --> 00:11:38.030
I followed you, which is a big thing for me.

171
00:11:39.000 --> 00:11:42.170
Didn't even meet you. Normally I follow and on mute.

172
00:11:42.200 --> 00:11:44.180
I did shave my mustache today. That's good.

173
00:11:44.181 --> 00:11:47.600
I didn't think we would have been better off taking

174
00:11:53.930 --> 00:11:56.650
[inaudible]. Why are you looking at me? Hysterically? Laughing.

175
00:11:56.890 --> 00:11:58.090
I don't know what I look like.

176
00:12:02.140 --> 00:12:04.810
[inaudible] like, I'm like a stalactite or a stalagmite

177
00:12:07.720 --> 00:12:09.940
do I just look like a sad beehive, right? Hurry up.

178
00:12:10.120 --> 00:12:12.790
Because it's going in my mouth. Yeah. Okay. Hurry up.

179
00:12:14.350 --> 00:12:18.550
Did your fans know how type you are? I don't think so. Yeah. It's a little,

180
00:12:18.551 --> 00:12:22.780
like, it looks a little like curdled. Yeah. Like cottage cheese. That's right.

181
00:12:22.781 --> 00:12:26.860
It does look like, um, a load of load.

182
00:12:27.220 --> 00:12:28.570
This actually looks good on you.

183
00:12:29.470 --> 00:12:32.350
It doesn't look as crazy as it seems to have on me.

184
00:12:32.500 --> 00:12:34.540
I do think this is expired.

185
00:12:35.530 --> 00:12:37.930
I don't think it's supposed to have these little chunks.

186
00:12:40.960 --> 00:12:43.450
I feel like that's nose. I didn't.

187
00:12:43.480 --> 00:12:46.810
I want your nose to age faster than the rest of your face. It was too young.

188
00:12:47.290 --> 00:12:50.800
Sabotaging me. I don't know how you're from Florida and you're such good skin.

189
00:12:50.801 --> 00:12:53.740
I don't go in the sun. I'm super white now. Then make them

190
00:12:56.290 --> 00:13:00.400
[inaudible] you know what I like about us? We're a forceful. Yes.

191
00:13:00.730 --> 00:13:05.200
And we're very honest with each other right away. And uh, moving forward.

192
00:13:05.230 --> 00:13:07.690
You're not allowed to have other girlfriends. I get it.

193
00:13:07.750 --> 00:13:11.740
My love is so all consuming that you won't really need other friends.

194
00:13:11.950 --> 00:13:15.130
That's good though. Yeah. It's not like a ton of ton of ton of friends.

195
00:13:15.820 --> 00:13:19.000
You won't have any after this. There's no like resentment. Yeah.

196
00:13:19.240 --> 00:13:23.200
I mean you can call each other out on things. Are you talking about,

197
00:13:23.730 --> 00:13:26.410
I feel like that me.

198
00:13:28.830 --> 00:13:33.760
No, no, no. I really, if I was going to, if I drop it,

199
00:13:33.761 --> 00:13:38.320
you he'll know. I'll feel it. I'm trying to win this. Right.

200
00:13:38.440 --> 00:13:42.880
I'm trying to win this video. I'm trying to break. Okay.

201
00:13:42.881 --> 00:13:46.660
We can't smile. Okay. How do the Housewives do it?

202
00:13:46.750 --> 00:13:47.830
Aren't you supposed to fill them up?

203
00:13:52.680 --> 00:13:53.730
He is getting crackly.

204
00:13:57.300 --> 00:13:58.140
Feel it tightening.

205
00:13:58.200 --> 00:14:02.400
I'm just going to move a little bit to make it less chunky to look like I had

206
00:14:02.401 --> 00:14:07.230
such high expectations for this. I know this has been set 30 minutes,

207
00:14:07.231 --> 00:14:11.490
so, okay. Let's just, I don't think it's supposed to have chunks.

208
00:14:11.580 --> 00:14:13.920
I think we need to write a Yelp review. Hey guys,

209
00:14:13.950 --> 00:14:18.570
you need to make your product work for people that reschedule for eight months.

210
00:14:23.760 --> 00:14:24.630
<v 1>How long did you shoot it?</v>

211
00:14:28.680 --> 00:14:30.810
<v 0>What did you just ask me? Like how much footage do you have?</v>

212
00:14:31.080 --> 00:14:34.590
Like it's like an hour. Have you told everyone how you like taught yourself?

213
00:14:34.591 --> 00:14:38.970
How to do all this stuff? Probably on like other people's stuff,

214
00:14:39.000 --> 00:14:43.470
but none of my stuff, your fans don't even know how you did started this. No,

215
00:14:44.850 --> 00:14:49.470
they might. If they seen the different interviews and stuff, but I am.

216
00:14:49.471 --> 00:14:52.880
So I'm not a sincere moment that you're probably gonna edit out and that's fine.

217
00:14:52.910 --> 00:14:57.740
Send it to me from, by channels. I am so important. Do you use these?

218
00:14:57.770 --> 00:15:01.610
No, I didn't cut it off. This is bothering you. I just said, okay,

219
00:15:01.611 --> 00:15:05.420
you're starting to look old. It looks like what?

220
00:15:05.421 --> 00:15:08.600
My makeup looks like every day here in Los Angeles.

221
00:15:09.710 --> 00:15:12.680
My freckles are way more prominent than your freckles, but I like them.

222
00:15:12.681 --> 00:15:15.740
I think they're sexy. Thanks. There are. These little ones are cute. Yeah.

223
00:15:15.741 --> 00:15:17.030
I have a ton of breast cancer.

224
00:15:18.170 --> 00:15:22.310
This is getting tighter and tighter is really starting to constrict my facial

225
00:15:22.580 --> 00:15:26.000
movement. This one freckle, like right here. And then it came,

226
00:15:26.980 --> 00:15:31.150
came out of nowhere. HR. Oh my God.

227
00:15:32.410 --> 00:15:36.130
Yeah, this is okay. This is what's supposed to do.

228
00:15:36.850 --> 00:15:40.590
Where's the mall. It's like right here where my sweat is. Right?

229
00:15:40.840 --> 00:15:44.380
She is by the way, swampy. She's a swampy lady.

230
00:15:44.590 --> 00:15:48.270
A lot of people don't know that about certain areas. Jesus

231
00:15:50.470 --> 00:15:53.530
temperature. Wouldn't he keeps her house because the air,

232
00:15:53.560 --> 00:15:57.610
I do think the air is clean. You almost messed up my mask.

233
00:15:58.360 --> 00:16:02.770
Oh, now it's messed up. It was so perfect before. Yeah.

234
00:16:02.771 --> 00:16:07.120
It makes it feel like you're um, snatched. What's that mean?

235
00:16:08.680 --> 00:16:13.180
Like snatched your wig, like a snatched waist. A snatched face.

236
00:16:14.350 --> 00:16:18.790
Snatched. I don't know. I heard somebody else say it. Yolo. No

237
00:16:21.400 --> 00:16:24.820
cool beans. I like that. That back.

238
00:16:25.240 --> 00:16:27.400
I don't think I ever left. Really? Yeah.

239
00:16:27.520 --> 00:16:31.510
I think divorced men with Bachar protector. Wow, cool beans.

240
00:16:33.430 --> 00:16:37.390
Yeah. If I was on a date with a guy and he's a cool dude, I would be like, ah,

241
00:16:37.450 --> 00:16:40.030
I'm gonna be a bummer. Yeah. It'd be a good name for a vegan restaurant.

242
00:16:40.240 --> 00:16:44.590
Cool beans. It's funny. How like depends on what it's for. You know,

243
00:16:44.591 --> 00:16:49.300
what about I would go to cool fears. Is that still happening? Yeah. Fierce.

244
00:16:49.330 --> 00:16:53.350
You hear that on Netflix? All the time. Johana sometimes says like, my boy

245
00:16:55.390 --> 00:17:00.190
is English as a first language. No, that's why that's a very European. Yeah.

246
00:17:01.310 --> 00:17:04.360
Yeah. Isn't it though. Yeah. It's like my boy,

247
00:17:07.120 --> 00:17:11.110
my boy. Yeah. Yeah. This is why YouTube does get canceled.

248
00:17:11.111 --> 00:17:15.610
I just realized I'm in comedy. So it's like slightly different. Oh, that's good.

249
00:17:15.611 --> 00:17:19.750
Yeah. How was that? How's that the worst interviewer

250
00:17:25.900 --> 00:17:30.100
[inaudible] when you transcribe something or, you know,

251
00:17:30.110 --> 00:17:33.190
take a clip out of context when you're not watching the whole clip or you don't

252
00:17:33.191 --> 00:17:35.410
know the person's previous work or, you know,

253
00:17:35.411 --> 00:17:38.140
you just see something completely out of context.

254
00:17:38.141 --> 00:17:42.940
It's probably easy to pathologize it or just anything out of context,

255
00:17:42.970 --> 00:17:46.150
not even comedy. It's just like, take something out of this clip.

256
00:17:47.140 --> 00:17:49.590
I know nothing about this person. You haven't seen any of their specials.

257
00:17:49.591 --> 00:17:53.580
You haven't looked at all their tweets. This is what they do, you know? And um,

258
00:17:53.610 --> 00:17:57.540
feel like I'm frowning at you, but I know. Why are you mad? Are we gonna fight?

259
00:18:01.110 --> 00:18:04.590
You're a different person. Oh my God.

260
00:18:04.591 --> 00:18:09.130
It looks so crazy. My lips are like, I know you do look like,

261
00:18:09.780 --> 00:18:11.730
um, I just got like a different model.

262
00:18:13.740 --> 00:18:18.030
Oh my God. This mind is different minds pulling my lip up.

263
00:18:18.060 --> 00:18:21.600
That's what it feels like a soon to mine a little bit is you're like my lips

264
00:18:21.601 --> 00:18:23.940
look fuller. I kind of, I kind of

265
00:18:25.740 --> 00:18:28.260
look like Selena Gomez. I get that.

266
00:18:32.280 --> 00:18:36.180
Your eyes look awesome. Oh my God. That's so I look sad.

267
00:18:36.240 --> 00:18:40.710
You look five, this like subscribe.

268
00:18:40.770 --> 00:18:43.860
Where did you find this? Who told you I'm hip?

269
00:18:44.820 --> 00:18:48.750
And just hope I have my finger on the pulse.

270
00:18:48.751 --> 00:18:50.730
And if nothing else comes from this video,

271
00:18:51.060 --> 00:18:53.850
I am going to auction off Amanda's nose,

272
00:18:53.851 --> 00:18:56.240
blood in my blood.

273
00:18:56.400 --> 00:19:00.120
I know I'm going to put these on eBay and nothing.

274
00:19:00.600 --> 00:19:03.570
I guess it's better that it looks like nothing worse. A really bloody one.

275
00:19:03.571 --> 00:19:04.560
If you throw it in the trash,

276
00:19:08.430 --> 00:19:12.650
this is what I came for. What are you gonna look like when you're old?

277
00:19:12.730 --> 00:19:15.680
And we now know you're still you're behind. This is true.

278
00:19:17.480 --> 00:19:21.800
This is very tight. I'm going to miss my lips. And when I watched this off,

279
00:19:21.801 --> 00:19:25.850
I would look like, really? That's I better,

280
00:19:29.090 --> 00:19:33.620
we have the same sinks we are weirdly similar.

281
00:19:33.980 --> 00:19:38.440
You were really nice to me. Yeah.

282
00:19:41.190 --> 00:19:45.860
I mean like, you know how some girls like a little bit of a diva or whatever,

283
00:19:46.430 --> 00:19:50.420
and it's a set you're on often, you know? Yeah. And I think for me,

284
00:19:50.421 --> 00:19:53.690
like I've been on the receiving end of a lot of that.

285
00:19:53.691 --> 00:19:58.490
And I have never walked through that feeling towards, for other people to have.

286
00:19:58.520 --> 00:20:01.730
And sometimes you do it by accident just because you're insecure or you're

287
00:20:02.150 --> 00:20:06.800
scared or whatever women are so pitted against each other. Naturally,

288
00:20:06.801 --> 00:20:11.300
I just try to go out of my way to be like, we're not doing that. Yeah. You know,

289
00:20:11.460 --> 00:20:14.630
I'm a guard or something. That's up. Yeah. Oh my God.

290
00:20:14.690 --> 00:20:18.440
I have blue eyeliner all over. Yeah. But I think, um,

291
00:20:18.830 --> 00:20:23.630
I feel like I'm carving like a clay sculpture, but yeah,

292
00:20:23.631 --> 00:20:28.220
you are nice. So there's that? Well, that's all it takes,

293
00:20:28.850 --> 00:20:31.970
but also you have such a like more energy.

294
00:20:32.630 --> 00:20:36.980
I feel grateful that it's off me too. Yeah.

295
00:20:36.981 --> 00:20:40.910
That was fun. Worth the eight month. Wait. Yeah.
