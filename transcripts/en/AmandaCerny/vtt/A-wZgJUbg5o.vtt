00:00:08.160 --> 00:00:13.100
<v 1>See about something, about what Childs, what did that? Wow.</v>

3
00:00:13.970 --> 00:00:18.140
He broke up. Whoa, Whoa, Whoa, Whoa. Wow.

4
00:00:19.100 --> 00:00:22.610
Did it hurt when you fell from heaven? Because I'm looking at an angel.

5
00:00:24.380 --> 00:00:28.880
Do you like sleeping? Me too? We should do it together some time. Oh,

6
00:00:29.900 --> 00:00:33.980
I'm not really feeling myself today, so maybe I can feel you instead. Well,

7
00:00:34.040 --> 00:00:38.450
I never, you just met this fun young lady. Oh my golly.

8
00:00:38.451 --> 00:00:43.310
Miss Molly. Well, you can call me Molly. Anytime you like.

9
00:00:43.940 --> 00:00:48.020
Well, man, it was too soon. Indeed. My apologies.

10
00:00:48.770 --> 00:00:52.400
It's quite all right. It's chilly out. Would you fancy my jacket?

11
00:00:53.900 --> 00:00:56.090
Well, only if it's boyfriend material.

12
00:01:01.340 --> 00:01:05.420
I mean, um, no, thank you.

<v 0>[Inaudible].</v>

14
00:03:05.280 --> 00:03:07.470
<v 1>All right. I'm just going to get right down to the real nitty gritty.</v>

15
00:03:08.250 --> 00:03:12.190
Would you like to go study with me? No, I,

16
00:03:12.200 --> 00:03:15.930
you spoken for something? No, just not interested,

17
00:03:16.740 --> 00:03:20.700
but I did meet him when I said I wanted to feel that pub she's a real angel from

18
00:03:20.701 --> 00:03:22.290
heaven, Matt.

19
00:03:29.820 --> 00:03:31.410
Oh, wow.

20
00:03:34.950 --> 00:03:35.783
Thank you.
