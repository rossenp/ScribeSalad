00:00:00.620 --> 00:00:04.020
<v 0>No. Nobody love Christmas, Carol. Yeah. I love the holidays.</v>

2
00:00:04.021 --> 00:00:08.040
I love eggnog missile toes. No, I can make it to the company's holiday party.

3
00:00:08.340 --> 00:00:10.530
Your sample isn't taken a day off. Neither am I?

4
00:00:23.900 --> 00:00:28.010
No, not you Holly.

5
00:00:29.540 --> 00:00:30.620
So you just moved in

6
00:00:37.550 --> 00:00:40.670
the box. Oh yeah. Good catch.

7
00:00:41.750 --> 00:00:45.440
Well known for having a good. I see you when you're sleeping, Santa.

8
00:00:58.940 --> 00:00:59.773
Okay.

9
00:01:08.900 --> 00:01:13.130
Pay me. I won't be on the last Christmas after. No,

10
00:01:13.131 --> 00:01:16.580
not you Carol. Sorry. I got a little distracted.

11
00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:20.480
I'm at the sky and Oh yeah. I'll just come in. Yeah. Good idea.

12
00:01:23.750 --> 00:01:27.050
No problem. So PFS.

13
00:01:27.290 --> 00:01:31.670
Do you have any exposition you want to tell me maybe about a little

14
00:01:31.671 --> 00:01:36.470
distraction, Carol. I just met the cutest boy in the hallway.

15
00:01:36.471 --> 00:01:40.520
We bumped into each other and he just moved in the building. Oh really?

16
00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:45.350
I think he may have broken my nose. So, uh, Oh. Oh, well that's nothing.

17
00:01:45.351 --> 00:01:50.330
A little Christmas cheer. Can't fix so true. Oh my gosh.

18
00:01:51.080 --> 00:01:54.290
The study of ever Christmas party in the bathroom.

19
00:02:14.060 --> 00:02:14.930
[inaudible] these numbers.

20
00:02:51.060 --> 00:02:53.600
[inaudible] I'll get it.

21
00:03:06.970 --> 00:03:11.230
Nick. The terrible music you're listening to is distracting me from my work.

22
00:03:13.960 --> 00:03:18.790
There's no way you think Christmas music is terrible. The perfect guy,

23
00:03:18.791 --> 00:03:19.660
10 minutes ago.

24
00:03:29.560 --> 00:03:31.180
One of those Christmas loving people, huh?

25
00:03:34.390 --> 00:03:38.050
Everyone loves Christmas. Nick,

26
00:03:39.970 --> 00:03:41.590
do you not love Christmas?

27
00:03:59.230 --> 00:04:03.790
Do Nick, do you love Christmas, Holly?

28
00:04:03.970 --> 00:04:05.890
Not only do I not love it?

29
00:04:08.760 --> 00:04:11.040
I don't like it.

30
00:04:20.010 --> 00:04:24.600
Sorry girl. No, no.

31
00:04:24.601 --> 00:04:27.180
Carol. I'm not giving up that easily.

32
00:04:27.720 --> 00:04:30.270
I'm going to get that Scrooge into the Christmas spirit.

33
00:04:30.271 --> 00:04:34.020
If it's the last thing I do, you need my help, Carol.

34
00:04:34.950 --> 00:04:39.210
You're my BFF. The only thing I need from you are sassy. Affirmations.

35
00:04:39.360 --> 00:04:43.950
You all have that boy breath on your Christmas tree by morning. Perfect.

36
00:04:44.640 --> 00:04:45.473
Thanks.

37
00:04:51.210 --> 00:04:53.790
Listen, Bob, the presentation is not going to present it.

38
00:05:05.850 --> 00:05:07.380
No, this is Miami.

39
00:05:12.810 --> 00:05:15.900
How many times do I have to tell her? I don't like Christmas.

40
00:05:16.680 --> 00:05:19.770
Are you seriously eating this? Let me cook for you.

41
00:05:20.410 --> 00:05:22.110
But I promise I won't talk about Christmas.

42
00:05:30.720 --> 00:05:35.700
This is so good. What do you do exactly?

43
00:05:36.180 --> 00:05:38.250
Well, when I was a kid,

44
00:05:38.251 --> 00:05:41.340
I used to pray every night for white Christmas in Miami,

45
00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:46.860
but then I grew up and I realized if Santa couldn't do it, I could.

46
00:05:47.310 --> 00:05:52.200
So I started this business and now I travel around people's houses and I mean,

47
00:05:52.260 --> 00:05:54.090
it's not outside their windows. Oh.

48
00:05:54.120 --> 00:05:57.000
And I even have a secret family recipe that makes us know, look extra.

49
00:05:58.250 --> 00:06:02.630
What's the recipe. It's a family secret. You and family.

50
00:06:02.960 --> 00:06:05.060
Are you Nick? It's ready?

51
00:06:09.380 --> 00:06:12.410
This is amazing. All right, Nick,

52
00:06:12.800 --> 00:06:14.870
why do you hate Christmas so much?

53
00:06:18.950 --> 00:06:21.800
What happened? Something happened in prison.

54
00:06:26.350 --> 00:06:27.183
Tell me Nick.

55
00:06:43.000 --> 00:06:47.170
I think we'll wait till after the commercial break. If you don't mind. Oh yeah.

56
00:06:47.980 --> 00:06:48.813
Fine.

57
00:06:57.100 --> 00:06:58.030
Nick. What happened

58
00:07:02.380 --> 00:07:04.600
Nick? Oh yeah. Um,

59
00:07:04.780 --> 00:07:07.540
my wife died a gruesome death on Christmas and

60
00:07:10.630 --> 00:07:11.463
come over.

61
00:07:18.340 --> 00:07:23.290
The bronc parent died that day. Oh, she's adorable, man.

62
00:07:23.740 --> 00:07:28.510
We don't celebrate Christmas. He sad. Maybe it's time.

63
00:07:28.511 --> 00:07:31.480
That changed holiday Christmas montage.

64
00:08:39.040 --> 00:08:39.873
[inaudible]

65
00:08:42.810 --> 00:08:46.990
no for somebody who's not too into Christmas or stockings. Pretty well home.

66
00:08:51.370 --> 00:08:55.030
If you think why stocking so well hung, you should see my [inaudible].

67
00:09:05.640 --> 00:09:07.950
Let me get it.

68
00:09:15.710 --> 00:09:19.740
Got it. I wanted to ask you to do something.

69
00:09:22.520 --> 00:09:26.150
Yeah, something I haven't done since my wife died. Oh,

70
00:09:27.320 --> 00:09:27.741
okay.

71
00:09:27.741 --> 00:09:31.550
And do you want to do the Santa and Mrs. Claus workshops like obsessed with

72
00:09:31.551 --> 00:09:36.380
Christmas. It's the most wonderful time of the year.

73
00:09:37.820 --> 00:09:40.940
It was like the lights, the cookies family.

74
00:09:40.970 --> 00:09:45.560
But don't you have any other interests? What were you asking me?

75
00:09:46.010 --> 00:09:48.410
You don't have to do the workshop thing on her first band. No,

76
00:09:48.411 --> 00:09:52.040
that's not what I want. Let's keep that in mind.

77
00:10:12.260 --> 00:10:16.670
Oh my God. Carol evil. Never guess what Nick asked me to do?

78
00:10:19.640 --> 00:10:22.850
No, but I should put one in my purse just in case.

79
00:10:26.210 --> 00:10:28.490
He asked me to go to his company's Christmas party.

80
00:10:29.000 --> 00:10:32.420
Like he's totally into Christmas. Now. He tells me booked all week,

81
00:10:32.421 --> 00:10:34.040
making that snow for his daughter, Noelle,

82
00:10:39.020 --> 00:10:39.853
what's going on?

83
00:10:51.800 --> 00:10:54.890
Hey, shouldn't you be outside? And I can see you're seeing another woman.

84
00:10:55.640 --> 00:10:59.270
Are you just using me to make snow and holiday cheer for your daughter? No.

85
00:10:59.271 --> 00:11:00.290
Holly, no.

86
00:11:00.291 --> 00:11:04.520
I hired you to make it snow because there's absolutely no way you make money.

87
00:11:04.940 --> 00:11:07.670
There are machines out there that they're doing exactly the same thing you were

88
00:11:07.671 --> 00:11:12.320
doing. Fashion is not trying to change the subject. There's a woman in there.

89
00:11:12.410 --> 00:11:13.430
Yeah, but that woman,

90
00:11:17.570 --> 00:11:18.403
Holly dogs

91
00:11:21.410 --> 00:11:23.630
I'll be so easily cleared up. If she would let me explain.

92
00:11:32.960 --> 00:11:37.730
Sorry, Holly. I guess I'll just be all on for Christmas after all.

93
00:11:38.150 --> 00:11:41.060
I'll be here. I know what happened.

94
00:11:50.480 --> 00:11:54.820
You can't just walk in Holly.

95
00:11:55.870 --> 00:11:57.730
I know we just met earlier today,

96
00:11:58.060 --> 00:12:01.510
but I'm starting to think I can spend the rest of my life with you then.

97
00:12:01.660 --> 00:12:04.960
Why did you hug another woman? Holly? That woman was my sister.

98
00:12:05.920 --> 00:12:07.960
Your sister? Yes. My sister.

99
00:12:10.530 --> 00:12:12.960
I don't know Nick. This is an ad enough.

100
00:12:13.770 --> 00:12:18.690
If she's your sister then why is she so hot? Good genes. I suppose.

101
00:12:19.710 --> 00:12:24.420
Gosh, Nick, I'm so sorry for the misunderstanding. So cookie. Oh,

102
00:12:24.900 --> 00:12:29.670
now it's my time to be mad with you because this doesn't work.

103
00:12:29.671 --> 00:12:33.810
If you don't trust me, what is it all I do trust you,

104
00:12:35.040 --> 00:12:36.930
Holly. You're the one I want.

105
00:12:37.380 --> 00:12:40.950
I'm not even sad anymore that my wife was murdered on Christmas and they never

106
00:12:40.951 --> 00:12:43.320
found the killer because he brought me to you

107
00:12:45.850 --> 00:12:47.130
mysterious ways.

108
00:12:52.140 --> 00:12:52.973
Oh my

109
00:12:56.040 --> 00:12:58.560
it's snowing. But I'm in here.

110
00:13:03.730 --> 00:13:08.640
[inaudible] counting my Christmas party with me. I do. I will come with you.

111
00:13:09.120 --> 00:13:09.990
Let me go change

112
00:13:19.710 --> 00:13:20.610
almost ready.

113
00:13:35.040 --> 00:13:36.450
[inaudible] watch killer Christmas.

114
00:13:36.720 --> 00:13:40.110
