00:00:02.700 --> 00:00:07.290
<v 0>Hi guys. I think I'm live. Let me get set up here.</v>

2
00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:16.290
There you are. All right. I believe I'm live.

3
00:00:18.120 --> 00:00:19.020
I guys. Okay.

4
00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:23.970
So today I get sent a lot of workout gear

5
00:00:24.330 --> 00:00:26.070
and I'm like, all right,

6
00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:29.730
it's probably good for you guys for me to know,

7
00:00:30.090 --> 00:00:34.920
to let you know how it fits, how it feels, what I like, what I don't like,

8
00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:39.390
because a lot of us all order those leggings and sports bras,

9
00:00:39.391 --> 00:00:41.010
and we're just not sure how they fit.

10
00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:44.190
And I'm going to give you some honest reviews.

11
00:00:44.191 --> 00:00:47.520
So there's that because I was about to go to the gym and I was like, wait,

12
00:00:48.060 --> 00:00:50.910
let me just share with you guys. Cause I put on an outfit. I'm like,

13
00:00:50.911 --> 00:00:52.290
this is not comfortable.

14
00:00:52.560 --> 00:00:57.330
So let me just share with you how my honest opinions

15
00:00:57.360 --> 00:01:01.920
about this workout gear. So to begin, um,

16
00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:06.330
I'm wearing, let's see, this is all back up.

17
00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:10.400
So this is under Armour.

18
00:01:10.760 --> 00:01:15.140
The bottoms you can see and the top

19
00:01:15.170 --> 00:01:16.820
is white box.

20
00:01:17.180 --> 00:01:21.410
So my reviews on this is the pants

21
00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:25.940
feel. They're not, I'm not getting enough compression here.

22
00:01:25.941 --> 00:01:30.590
I love the colors. I love me on for the gym. I think it's super fun and bright.

23
00:01:31.730 --> 00:01:34.760
Um, but I'm feeling like you could see right here.

24
00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:37.460
It's not really that supportive.

25
00:01:37.730 --> 00:01:41.990
So I wish I had more compression here and on the thighs,

26
00:01:42.170 --> 00:01:46.820
but I do like the fact that they're high-waisted because I got them holiday, uh,

27
00:01:48.350 --> 00:01:50.240
games. So yeah,

28
00:01:50.300 --> 00:01:54.230
this makes me feel better about going into the gym and I'm in Miami.

29
00:01:54.231 --> 00:01:57.950
So I don't really like wearing layers and layers of clothing.

30
00:01:57.980 --> 00:02:02.840
I'll go to the gym just like this. And I want to feel like still like,

31
00:02:03.860 --> 00:02:07.370
uh, supported and this top, as you can see,

32
00:02:07.371 --> 00:02:09.410
it makes me feel super supported.

33
00:02:09.710 --> 00:02:14.510
But I also feel like I'm risking a nip slip here and I don't

34
00:02:14.630 --> 00:02:18.290
like the padding in it actually would rather,

35
00:02:18.500 --> 00:02:23.240
this is the packing inside. And actually, so you'd rather take that out.

36
00:02:23.241 --> 00:02:26.990
This is like, um, I know I have a pimple there. Um,

37
00:02:27.980 --> 00:02:31.520
so I don't know if you guys can really see, I'm trying to make it.

38
00:02:31.880 --> 00:02:36.320
So that's the padding that's inside. So this side is without the Patti now,

39
00:02:36.890 --> 00:02:41.840
and then this side is with the Patty, but I hate padding him,

40
00:02:42.650 --> 00:02:43.880
especially thick padding.

41
00:02:43.881 --> 00:02:47.690
I know it's probably good cause I have bigger boobs,

42
00:02:47.750 --> 00:02:52.280
so I don't really need this. I know it like hides the nipple, which is great.

43
00:02:52.310 --> 00:02:53.600
But um,

44
00:02:54.320 --> 00:02:59.290
now I feel even better because I don't feel like I'm like going to

45
00:02:59.291 --> 00:03:02.320
the gym, but um, it looks,

46
00:03:02.321 --> 00:03:06.100
it makes your boobs look great, but again,

47
00:03:07.150 --> 00:03:11.950
and it's also pretty supportive, but I'm the mirror over here.

48
00:03:12.160 --> 00:03:15.940
That's what I'm looking at out. But again, I just,

49
00:03:17.110 --> 00:03:21.220
I don't know. I feel a little bit squishy. Maybe it's a size too small for me,

50
00:03:21.850 --> 00:03:25.300
but I like the open back. Um, so the swipe box,

51
00:03:25.780 --> 00:03:29.770
this is under Armour again, as you can see,

52
00:03:30.400 --> 00:03:33.190
like can do squats in it and they are comfy.

53
00:03:33.220 --> 00:03:36.520
Like I would wear these around the house more than I would wear them to the gym.

54
00:03:36.880 --> 00:03:41.170
But it's one of those situations where you're also like pulling up. Um,

55
00:03:41.200 --> 00:03:45.040
but I like the mini on accents and it ties the outfit together.

56
00:03:45.370 --> 00:03:46.960
Even though it's two different brands,

57
00:03:48.790 --> 00:03:52.810
I'm reading your guys' comments. Okay, cool.

58
00:03:52.811 --> 00:03:57.760
So now I'm going to try on another outfit that I

59
00:03:57.761 --> 00:04:00.250
have, which one should I do next?

60
00:04:00.280 --> 00:04:03.430
I'm going to do this one because actually, um,

61
00:04:03.580 --> 00:04:08.080
a lady in my building gave these to me from this brand because she went to

62
00:04:08.081 --> 00:04:11.110
LA and she was like, Oh, this brand is awesome.

63
00:04:11.380 --> 00:04:13.930
And it feels really nice. Um,

64
00:04:15.070 --> 00:04:18.760
this is drip, drip, drip do.

65
00:04:19.760 --> 00:04:24.550
This is by I hadn't. I took off the tags.

66
00:04:24.700 --> 00:04:27.340
Well, a good thing is there's not a lot of tags on this,

67
00:04:27.460 --> 00:04:30.430
so they won't bother you. There's literally no name on this.

68
00:04:33.490 --> 00:04:36.940
There has to be, Oh my gosh. There's nothing.

69
00:04:38.860 --> 00:04:42.730
There's nothing on here. Wait, I had another one.

70
00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:45.160
I think it was like in the garri or something like that.

71
00:04:53.300 --> 00:04:55.110
<v 1>Yeah. Oh, okay.</v>

72
00:04:57.120 --> 00:04:57.953
<v 0>It is</v>

73
00:05:03.870 --> 00:05:08.040
gamma and I G a M a soul. Oh yeah,

74
00:05:08.280 --> 00:05:11.370
you got on the soul. So this says, um,

75
00:05:11.580 --> 00:05:16.440
the brands and I think it says they're

76
00:05:16.441 --> 00:05:18.810
like 90 bucks a legging.

77
00:05:19.830 --> 00:05:24.780
So I'm going to try these on they're super thin as you can see. And,

78
00:05:25.440 --> 00:05:28.950
um, it comes with the matching sports bra. I like the pattern.

79
00:05:29.400 --> 00:05:32.820
I think it's really cute. It's like a mermaid. Um, so I'm going to try this on.

80
00:05:33.150 --> 00:05:37.260
<v 1>Maybe, can you entertain them while I tried this on?</v>

81
00:05:40.830 --> 00:05:44.640
Maybe. Okay.

82
00:05:45.930 --> 00:05:46.650
He's worried.

83
00:05:46.650 --> 00:05:49.350
<v 0>Sorry guys. So I'm going to try this one real quick and we'll be right.</v>

84
00:05:53.160 --> 00:05:53.993
<v 1>Cool.</v>

85
00:05:59.120 --> 00:06:02.600
<v 0>I'm in the, in the other room or</v>

86
00:06:05.030 --> 00:06:08.030
my website in the comments,

87
00:06:12.410 --> 00:06:16.820
um, uh,

88
00:06:17.660 --> 00:06:21.590
love you from Kenya, Kenya,

89
00:06:22.130 --> 00:06:23.930
Ragnar. What is you on is doing you?

90
00:06:23.940 --> 00:06:26.870
Honest was working on his computer for his website,

91
00:06:26.871 --> 00:06:31.820
but now he's here reading the comments. Um, man,

92
00:06:32.180 --> 00:06:36.770
this is a strong sports for a book book book.

93
00:06:39.830 --> 00:06:42.170
All right. What's your plan for 2020?

94
00:06:44.330 --> 00:06:47.510
We're giving one, a nice Anita bond.

95
00:06:47.511 --> 00:06:52.070
Bowser your bottle. What is your honest?

96
00:06:52.130 --> 00:06:54.610
Do it again? We're here. All right guys.

97
00:06:54.790 --> 00:06:59.260
So this is another outfit. Um,

98
00:06:59.290 --> 00:07:03.760
that's when I was just talking about, so a few things I don't,

99
00:07:04.600 --> 00:07:09.070
again, the patterns are super cute. You can see the issue I'm having.

100
00:07:09.071 --> 00:07:11.110
I think with the bra, again,

101
00:07:12.670 --> 00:07:14.560
these pads inside,

102
00:07:14.590 --> 00:07:19.330
aren't really doing their job of just covering up the nipples

103
00:07:19.360 --> 00:07:23.890
or um, and it's not that supportive. Maybe it's more of like a yoga bra.

104
00:07:25.060 --> 00:07:25.893
Um,

105
00:07:25.930 --> 00:07:30.430
but then the pants are actually super cute and I get a lot of compliments on

106
00:07:30.431 --> 00:07:34.840
this. I do wish that the lines went a little higher,

107
00:07:34.930 --> 00:07:39.900
but um, overall it's cute. It's a cute outfit. I like it.

108
00:07:39.901 --> 00:07:43.990
And it's really comfy. But again, um, the sports bra,

109
00:07:44.350 --> 00:07:47.740
isn't a high impact sports bra. It's more of a

110
00:07:49.720 --> 00:07:54.100
[inaudible] or yoga type sports bra. And with that, like,

111
00:07:54.101 --> 00:07:56.950
I like how it has opened back because if you have closed back,

112
00:07:56.980 --> 00:07:59.530
you get a lot of back sweat and you break out.

113
00:07:59.590 --> 00:08:03.100
So that's why I have a pimple right there.

114
00:08:03.101 --> 00:08:07.480
And that's because of the sports bra. Um, but yeah,

115
00:08:07.870 --> 00:08:10.360
so this is really cute.

116
00:08:10.660 --> 00:08:14.380
I think it would look really cute too with like a flowy tank with an open back.

117
00:08:15.430 --> 00:08:19.750
Um, yeah, I can do the pants are,

118
00:08:19.930 --> 00:08:23.620
I love how I always demonstrate with the squat, but the pants that are,

119
00:08:25.330 --> 00:08:28.120
you feel good, they go down a little when I squat,

120
00:08:28.990 --> 00:08:31.480
I'm trying to give you like every angle over view,

121
00:08:31.540 --> 00:08:34.510
like over all of these clothes are great, but, um,

122
00:08:34.540 --> 00:08:38.290
there's things that could be better. So cute.

123
00:08:38.920 --> 00:08:40.360
I wish this was up more.

124
00:08:40.600 --> 00:08:44.020
I almost don't make it cause it's like a mid-rise and I really like the

125
00:08:44.530 --> 00:08:48.670
high-rise pants and as a personal preference, I other like at low or like,

126
00:08:50.290 --> 00:08:54.400
um, but yeah, and I want to feel like, again, these are free.

127
00:08:54.401 --> 00:08:59.220
These are more yoga type pants because you feel the compression

128
00:08:59.221 --> 00:09:03.360
here, which is great. But here I feel like it like goes down a little bit. Yeah.

129
00:09:06.690 --> 00:09:10.400
I love you guys too. Um,

130
00:09:12.200 --> 00:09:16.970
yeah, so again, I'm not a fan of the padding,

131
00:09:16.990 --> 00:09:18.950
especially with lighter sports bras,

132
00:09:19.550 --> 00:09:23.510
just because like lighter colors. I mean,

133
00:09:24.260 --> 00:09:26.420
just because you can see the pattern all the way through,

134
00:09:26.421 --> 00:09:28.730
I'm like an expert on math major guys.

135
00:09:29.030 --> 00:09:31.940
I've been wearing Felicia clothes and athletic clothes,

136
00:09:31.941 --> 00:09:35.960
like every day of my entire freaking life. And I love it,

137
00:09:37.220 --> 00:09:42.140
but there's things that could be better hearing there.

138
00:09:43.550 --> 00:09:44.630
And there's nothing like that.

139
00:09:44.860 --> 00:09:49.700
Like having a really cute outfit to go in the gym and motivate you to

140
00:09:49.701 --> 00:09:50.930
work out even harder.

141
00:09:53.290 --> 00:09:57.310
So I have like hundreds of pairs of different likings sports for us. Talk,

142
00:09:58.040 --> 00:09:59.210
sorry guys. Intermission.

143
00:09:59.211 --> 00:10:03.260
I'm just changing well coming out in a new outfit.

144
00:10:06.080 --> 00:10:10.010
Okay. All right. So this is a,

145
00:10:10.130 --> 00:10:14.750
I haven't worn this one before. This is all under Armour. Um,

146
00:10:14.880 --> 00:10:18.050
my nose is running. Okay. So

147
00:10:19.790 --> 00:10:24.530
very sticky. Okay. Once you have those up, it's pretty good. The worst.

148
00:10:24.590 --> 00:10:27.260
And I don't know why people promote like,

149
00:10:27.820 --> 00:10:32.720
so it has a zipper in the back self slip. So I don't have to ask you a Honda.

150
00:10:32.721 --> 00:10:35.810
So every time and I'm wearing, um, a size,

151
00:10:35.811 --> 00:10:40.640
small sports bra and all of them and then size

152
00:10:40.641 --> 00:10:43.340
small pants and all of them, but,

153
00:10:44.210 --> 00:10:45.980
and this is a small sports bra top,

154
00:10:46.010 --> 00:10:50.960
but it feels a little bit big again. I like support.

155
00:10:51.590 --> 00:10:53.600
Um, so when I'm running, it's like,

156
00:10:53.601 --> 00:10:57.230
there's a lot of movement and I do a lot of hit trainings or high intensity

157
00:10:57.231 --> 00:10:58.730
interval training, any attrition.

158
00:10:59.480 --> 00:11:04.040
I do a lot of high intensity interval training and

159
00:11:09.740 --> 00:11:12.320
all right. And that's, um,

160
00:11:13.910 --> 00:11:17.120
heavy impacts. So on a lot of the different movements,

161
00:11:17.121 --> 00:11:21.290
like I'll do jump squats. I'll do even mountain climb.

162
00:11:21.410 --> 00:11:25.610
We're seeing the one stationary. It's a lot of balancing. Um, so I like support,

163
00:11:25.880 --> 00:11:29.120
especially when I feel support here and it's not here. It's like,

164
00:11:29.121 --> 00:11:31.250
what's the point? You're just suffocating me here.

165
00:11:31.760 --> 00:11:36.440
But I like the idea of this outfit. I think it was there like this,

166
00:11:36.441 --> 00:11:38.870
like the blocking on the side. Um,

167
00:11:39.860 --> 00:11:44.840
but it's not something I would like go out of my way to get. I'm such a,

168
00:11:44.841 --> 00:11:48.740
like, I'm hard credit. I really am. These outfits are cute,

169
00:11:48.741 --> 00:11:52.940
but like they're not fully there. So I,

170
00:11:53.170 --> 00:11:56.980
the back, all right. Things that like,

171
00:11:57.550 --> 00:12:02.260
I like the matchy-matchy I think that's really cute. I like the,

172
00:12:03.010 --> 00:12:05.800
um, the patterns and the colors with the black.

173
00:12:06.340 --> 00:12:09.100
I like some of the lines on it and some of the cuts on it.

174
00:12:09.640 --> 00:12:13.720
I don't like the fact that there's not enough support up here.

175
00:12:13.721 --> 00:12:17.710
It feels like this has too much give, so it's not really supporting.

176
00:12:18.220 --> 00:12:21.250
And this again, I'm not a fan of mid-rise.

177
00:12:21.370 --> 00:12:24.880
So that's the preference and it feels like it's a little baggy right here.

178
00:12:24.881 --> 00:12:28.930
So that might mean the pants are a little bit small for me. Um, but then again,

179
00:12:28.931 --> 00:12:32.470
if I went to a medium of used skirt, so, um,

180
00:12:33.220 --> 00:12:36.190
and the feel is nice, but it's a little thick of a legging.

181
00:12:36.580 --> 00:12:41.050
I like it when I still feel the compression, but it's still a lighter liking.

182
00:12:41.410 --> 00:12:45.370
So that being said, I think my outfit so far,

183
00:12:45.371 --> 00:12:49.120
that's like my favorite is probably the first one,

184
00:12:49.180 --> 00:12:53.560
just because it looks like it's the most. Wow.

185
00:12:54.520 --> 00:12:56.230
Um, cause it makes my boobs look the best too.

186
00:12:56.231 --> 00:13:00.520
And it also gives me the most support in the first outfit. Uh,

187
00:13:01.150 --> 00:13:03.460
but these ones are okay. Like I would wear them,

188
00:13:03.580 --> 00:13:08.380
but I wouldn't be like stoked to go out and feel like I'm going to get all the

189
00:13:08.381 --> 00:13:12.970
compliments on my outfit, but I would still feel okay wearing them. And again,

190
00:13:12.971 --> 00:13:13.804
I'm not,

191
00:13:13.960 --> 00:13:18.340
I'm not personally a huge fan of the sports bras that are like tank

192
00:13:18.341 --> 00:13:19.174
tops.

193
00:13:19.270 --> 00:13:23.530
I'd rather just wear a sports bra and then wear a tank top over it.

194
00:13:23.590 --> 00:13:28.570
If I want one. All right. Moving on to the next one.

195
00:13:30.910 --> 00:13:33.760
Sorry guys. One sec. Oh wait,

196
00:13:33.790 --> 00:13:37.750
actually I'll just change it here because Herman and Lenay might come up

197
00:13:38.980 --> 00:13:42.520
and that's lovely. Good. Cause I'm changing angle over here.

198
00:13:43.220 --> 00:13:44.680
I'm going to change into the next one.

199
00:13:50.520 --> 00:13:52.950
<v 1>You can hear me and I'm sorry,</v>

200
00:13:53.760 --> 00:13:57.960
but I just shared so much water and it's

201
00:13:57.961 --> 00:14:01.080
necessary. The good news is,

202
00:14:01.320 --> 00:14:06.270
is that all of these leggings are easy to take off yourself

203
00:14:07.470 --> 00:14:08.370
and like, hold on

204
00:14:13.230 --> 00:14:16.290
and not have like complete struggle.

205
00:14:18.940 --> 00:14:22.770
Even the sports bras, anything to take on and off,

206
00:14:23.490 --> 00:14:24.990
which is what we want.

207
00:14:29.430 --> 00:14:34.380
All right. So I'm trying on another lame

208
00:14:35.730 --> 00:14:36.563
look.

209
00:14:45.990 --> 00:14:49.470
Okay. What are these go up really nice.

210
00:14:50.550 --> 00:14:51.500
I like that.

211
00:15:00.380 --> 00:15:03.470
You guys were really cute.

212
00:15:06.440 --> 00:15:08.060
Oh, you might have a new face.

213
00:15:14.680 --> 00:15:17.470
<v 0>I'm back. Sorry for the delay. All right.</v>

214
00:15:18.160 --> 00:15:21.880
So these don't go together, but

215
00:15:24.130 --> 00:15:26.470
okay. Where do I begin?

216
00:15:26.980 --> 00:15:31.570
So these are the leggings and they're very

217
00:15:31.600 --> 00:15:35.920
light and easy to put on the field. Nice.

218
00:15:35.950 --> 00:15:40.420
They don't feel like they're, they're like a cotton too.

219
00:15:41.110 --> 00:15:43.660
So for the girls, um,

220
00:15:44.530 --> 00:15:48.340
you can breathe and it doesn't feel like you're going to get too much sweat

221
00:15:48.341 --> 00:15:52.750
going on there. And if you do, it'll dry up. Um,

222
00:15:53.530 --> 00:15:55.360
they are a little bit long.

223
00:15:56.110 --> 00:15:58.540
You can see I'm five foot seven.

224
00:15:59.020 --> 00:16:03.010
And these are like for somebody that's like five, nine,

225
00:16:03.490 --> 00:16:07.930
six foot five, 10, five, nine, five 10. Um,

226
00:16:08.770 --> 00:16:12.670
but so it's the bottom zone warm. And I hate when that happens with leggings,

227
00:16:12.671 --> 00:16:17.140
but overall they're really cute. I love this detail on the side.

228
00:16:17.141 --> 00:16:20.860
Like the lace. I think that's super cute. This is by,

229
00:16:20.890 --> 00:16:23.110
I think it was this beach funny. Yeah.

230
00:16:24.430 --> 00:16:29.380
BB fit is their athletes, your line that they sent me these. Um,

231
00:16:30.010 --> 00:16:33.100
but these feel really good. It's fun to go like this.

232
00:16:33.550 --> 00:16:37.900
And they're just a little too long. I like the overall good.

233
00:16:38.020 --> 00:16:42.040
I think they're really cute. And the booties cute.

234
00:16:42.100 --> 00:16:45.160
I loved the most French foodie. Um,

235
00:16:45.550 --> 00:16:50.470
and then the top is again from hitting the gamma sole.

236
00:16:50.471 --> 00:16:55.450
So this is workout. Um,

237
00:16:56.140 --> 00:17:00.280
so the top is a sports bra.

238
00:17:00.520 --> 00:17:05.440
So let me see, this is the underneath of the top. And then,

239
00:17:06.220 --> 00:17:10.900
um, the other part is like a sheer top on it. It's a cute idea.

240
00:17:10.930 --> 00:17:15.010
And I know before I said, I like a sports bra to be a sports bra,

241
00:17:15.040 --> 00:17:19.810
but this is a super light and it's a

242
00:17:19.811 --> 00:17:22.360
little transparent, which is nice. I like that.

243
00:17:22.870 --> 00:17:25.300
And so I still feel comfortable and flowing.

244
00:17:25.690 --> 00:17:30.010
The only thing that I think they could have done better again is with them.

245
00:17:30.970 --> 00:17:32.230
And the support's pretty good on this one,

246
00:17:32.231 --> 00:17:35.440
but the bunching up of the top right here,

247
00:17:35.800 --> 00:17:37.780
and it goes out a little bit here.

248
00:17:38.020 --> 00:17:42.340
So I'd rather have it slim me more here and then, um,

249
00:17:42.370 --> 00:17:45.400
be flowy. But overall the back is really cute.

250
00:17:46.120 --> 00:17:47.740
And the front sq,

251
00:17:47.770 --> 00:17:52.170
like I would wear this top out throughout the day and then go to the gym minute.

252
00:17:52.220 --> 00:17:56.640
At the end of the day, I'm inspiring you to work out.

253
00:17:57.360 --> 00:18:01.020
I love that. Okay. So this all fits cute.

254
00:18:01.410 --> 00:18:04.500
We love a black outfit. Um,

255
00:18:05.070 --> 00:18:07.500
and then the next one is pretty basic.

256
00:18:07.501 --> 00:18:10.500
This is actually what I'm really going to go work out in.

257
00:18:10.501 --> 00:18:12.450
I've worn this a million times before,

258
00:18:12.750 --> 00:18:17.130
but the only reason I don't like it is because, you know,

259
00:18:17.940 --> 00:18:21.330
love Nike. I think they're great, but it's a little too.

260
00:18:21.331 --> 00:18:25.350
It's not like that's a little ah, in your face. Um,

261
00:18:25.620 --> 00:18:30.570
but I like the neons mans are cool and these shorts have little undies inside.

262
00:18:31.020 --> 00:18:34.170
So you feel like you're not going to flash everybody.

263
00:18:34.470 --> 00:18:37.620
I hate the shorts that are super loose. They don't have the uneasy inside.

264
00:18:37.621 --> 00:18:42.020
And then you're just like, hello and vagina. So this is good. That,

265
00:18:42.210 --> 00:18:46.740
that covers that up. There's little pockets in the back that I don't trust. Um,

266
00:18:46.800 --> 00:18:51.510
and then zipper pockets that I trust more so important for leggings and stuff to

267
00:18:51.511 --> 00:18:55.680
have pockets. That's the one thing that none of these have are pockets.

268
00:18:56.640 --> 00:18:58.350
Where am I going to put my cell phone?

269
00:18:58.830 --> 00:19:02.700
Like they expect us to put it right in here, which isn't ideal.

270
00:19:02.760 --> 00:19:06.810
This is pockets. Oh wait, Nope, nothing.

271
00:19:07.530 --> 00:19:10.950
We're going to put it in phones and we're not carrying a purse around with us at

272
00:19:10.951 --> 00:19:15.060
the gym guys. Come on. Functional,

273
00:19:15.090 --> 00:19:19.320
functional fitness please. Um, but everything is really cute,

274
00:19:20.610 --> 00:19:22.080
not perfect BECU.

275
00:19:22.260 --> 00:19:25.470
I'm going to put this one on so you can see what it looks like with shorts.

276
00:19:25.500 --> 00:19:27.750
And I mostly did all leggings.

277
00:19:27.751 --> 00:19:32.040
I don't know if I started minnows to serve running. I'm like, um,

278
00:19:32.790 --> 00:19:35.190
I mostly did all leggings. I don't know if it's show you shorts,

279
00:19:35.370 --> 00:19:37.890
cause it's not kind of this, whatever we want it to be.

280
00:19:38.730 --> 00:19:42.090
This is my first time doing this. And if you guys like this,

281
00:19:42.600 --> 00:19:47.520
I get boxes all the time of different products and brands that I'm

282
00:19:47.521 --> 00:19:49.650
not afraid to give my honest opinions on.

283
00:19:49.651 --> 00:19:53.460
So if you guys want me to do this more,

284
00:19:53.760 --> 00:19:57.630
I'll give you some feedback on products that you're seeing all the time,

285
00:19:57.660 --> 00:20:00.960
that you can know how it fits and viewable. Instead,

286
00:20:02.220 --> 00:20:05.430
nothing I review is probably very,

287
00:20:05.431 --> 00:20:10.350
very few probably ever going to be perfect in my mind as all my

288
00:20:10.351 --> 00:20:14.790
opinion, but the ones that do you'll be like,

289
00:20:17.160 --> 00:20:20.850
but all these are super cute. Again, disclaimers. I'm going to put this on.

290
00:20:22.160 --> 00:20:25.790
<v 1>Show you what I'm working on in today. Not a, let me,</v>

291
00:20:26.160 --> 00:20:31.130
this is actually growing on me and these leggings are really easy

292
00:20:31.131 --> 00:20:34.670
to take off. I like that they don't get stuck on your ankles,

293
00:20:35.630 --> 00:20:40.430
even though they are a bit long, uh,

294
00:20:46.850 --> 00:20:48.250
gray shorts on

295
00:20:52.660 --> 00:20:53.770
or the shorts.

296
00:21:04.830 --> 00:21:09.180
<v 0>Cut up in here. All right. So</v>

297
00:21:12.180 --> 00:21:16.470
here's the last one that I'm going to go to the gym and today.

298
00:21:16.770 --> 00:21:20.640
So as you can see, I either like really low horror, like high,

299
00:21:21.840 --> 00:21:25.380
um, mid-rise, aren't the best for me. I know some people prefer that,

300
00:21:25.680 --> 00:21:27.540
but this is what I'm working out in today.

301
00:21:27.810 --> 00:21:30.780
I like it because it makes my booty look, boom.

302
00:21:31.380 --> 00:21:35.520
And then just the right amount of support that I needed. Boobs look good.

303
00:21:35.700 --> 00:21:39.750
You feel good? They feel supported, secure. Um, and it's pretty,

304
00:21:40.440 --> 00:21:45.210
it's not like something that you can wear to lunch and then go to the

305
00:21:45.211 --> 00:21:49.830
gym. But this is a gym outfit. This is what you work out in. But yeah.

306
00:21:51.390 --> 00:21:55.770
So not this video.

307
00:21:56.400 --> 00:22:00.480
All right. So we got this outfit going. My favorite,

308
00:22:00.481 --> 00:22:03.390
I think of the leggings,

309
00:22:03.600 --> 00:22:07.410
my favorite one to go to the gym and like right now is this one.

310
00:22:07.890 --> 00:22:12.780
As I feel functional, I can get stuff done. I feel supported. I got a sneeze.

311
00:22:16.650 --> 00:22:17.483
<v 1>All right.</v>

312
00:22:18.150 --> 00:22:22.980
<v 0>Thank you for those two steps, Leslie. Um, yeah, I dunno.</v>

313
00:22:23.010 --> 00:22:27.420
I like, so like the first one, I love the black one, but not together.

314
00:22:27.421 --> 00:22:31.200
I don't think I would want them together and maybe were a different color color

315
00:22:31.210 --> 00:22:34.410
linking with the black top just to make it more fun. Um,

316
00:22:34.620 --> 00:22:37.680
cause I still want little cute details and things through the gym and stuff.

317
00:22:38.100 --> 00:22:42.930
And this one, I guess I can sit down now. How's uh,

318
00:22:43.530 --> 00:22:47.770
how's the workout. Um, but this one, I feel like, uh,

319
00:22:47.771 --> 00:22:52.530
I can wear it and be safe and all that stuff.

320
00:22:52.531 --> 00:22:53.364
So yeah.

321
00:22:53.490 --> 00:22:58.200
And then with my reviews on that was like five outfits where you guys think that

322
00:22:58.201 --> 00:22:59.034
was enough.

323
00:22:59.100 --> 00:23:03.540
And maybe I should do this every,

324
00:23:05.430 --> 00:23:10.200
every week. Biweekly. I don't know. You guys let me know in the comments,

325
00:23:10.201 --> 00:23:12.840
what you want. What do I say?

326
00:23:12.841 --> 00:23:16.860
I say demand and all supply. I love you guys.

327
00:23:17.130 --> 00:23:20.850
You're amazing. These clothes are super cute.

328
00:23:20.880 --> 00:23:25.200
Great job on building something from nothing. Um, again,

329
00:23:25.201 --> 00:23:28.950
I'm always going to have opinions and little critiques and trying on different

330
00:23:28.951 --> 00:23:32.160
things. I get a ton of makeup and beauty products and all that stuff too.

331
00:23:32.161 --> 00:23:36.930
If you want me to review and do unboxings for those like even home goods.

332
00:23:36.960 --> 00:23:40.110
Oh, I love that. Misses are my favorite. As you can see again,

333
00:23:40.170 --> 00:23:44.820
I think I told you guys in my last video, my stepdad painted that. Um,

334
00:23:46.100 --> 00:23:47.540
how often do I work out?

335
00:23:48.590 --> 00:23:52.940
I try to work out every day,

336
00:23:52.970 --> 00:23:57.140
but I've been slacking in big time. Like I haven't worked out at all this,

337
00:23:57.710 --> 00:24:02.270
this break and I'm playing, I'm going today with her mom and I and your hotness.

338
00:24:02.300 --> 00:24:05.660
But to get me back in the mindset, cause that just been working all day,

339
00:24:05.661 --> 00:24:10.220
but no excuses. I hate excuses. The worst, no excuses. It's my fault.

340
00:24:10.221 --> 00:24:11.840
I'm sorry. I need to go to the gym

341
00:24:14.260 --> 00:24:18.120
and love you guys too. Sweet. Okay. Some of,

342
00:24:18.160 --> 00:24:22.450
I need a moderator for some of these live stream moments,

343
00:24:22.480 --> 00:24:25.900
but yeah, these are honest reviews. I hope that's helpful,

344
00:24:25.930 --> 00:24:29.620
helpful for girls going out and shopping and you know, who knows?

345
00:24:29.650 --> 00:24:34.510
Maybe I can have some of my guy friends come in and do some reviews for workout

346
00:24:34.511 --> 00:24:35.560
clothes for guys too.

347
00:24:35.561 --> 00:24:40.360
Or even just like fashion clothes or even products that are men

348
00:24:40.900 --> 00:24:44.410
and for women. So everybody's, you know,

349
00:24:44.920 --> 00:24:49.690
taken care of. Um, that's just texted me. Oh,

350
00:24:49.691 --> 00:24:52.930
I got a package. I got another package. You guys,

351
00:24:53.710 --> 00:24:56.410
I need to do more videos and show you what I'm getting,

352
00:24:56.411 --> 00:24:57.820
because it's exciting for me.

353
00:24:57.821 --> 00:25:01.930
So it's exciting for you and you can learn about things before you go out and

354
00:25:01.931 --> 00:25:05.950
buy them. Okay. I love you so much. Make sure you subscribe,

355
00:25:06.250 --> 00:25:08.680
turn on the notifications, ring that up. Well,

356
00:25:08.681 --> 00:25:10.750
because I don't have a schedule yet.

357
00:25:11.020 --> 00:25:14.950
Maybe you guys can help me come up with this schedule. Bi-weekly weekly, daily.

358
00:25:15.010 --> 00:25:18.700
I don't know. Let me know. Um, but I like these live streams.

359
00:25:18.701 --> 00:25:19.840
I think they're super fun.

360
00:25:19.870 --> 00:25:22.570
And then I'm going to post them on my page so you can watch later.

361
00:25:22.571 --> 00:25:23.650
And if you're watching later,

362
00:25:23.651 --> 00:25:26.560
because I didn't tell anybody I'm doing this last game,

363
00:25:26.590 --> 00:25:30.610
I was going to do an IgG story, but we forgot and that's life.

364
00:25:31.360 --> 00:25:35.350
But in general, just comment below what you want to see more of. And again,

365
00:25:35.680 --> 00:25:40.390
subscribe. I love you. Okay, bye. I'm going to see if I know how to end this.

366
00:25:42.760 --> 00:25:44.950
How do I add this? Oh, interesting. Okay. Bye.

367
00:25:49.630 --> 00:25:50.740
Yes. And.
