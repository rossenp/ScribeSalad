00:00:00.240 --> 00:00:04.620
<v 0>Okay. So today I'm cutting bangs on my own,</v>

2
00:00:04.650 --> 00:00:06.300
not a hairstylist. Here we go.

3
00:00:06.360 --> 00:00:10.770
I'm only doing this because my sister did it and it looked really cute,

4
00:00:11.250 --> 00:00:15.270
except she has a completely different face shape than me and I'm bored are

5
00:00:15.271 --> 00:00:17.910
right. I don't really even have the tools,

6
00:00:18.270 --> 00:00:21.300
dull scissors and potentially pretty good scissors,

7
00:00:21.330 --> 00:00:24.360
but they haven't been used in forever. So I found a knife sharpener.

8
00:00:29.060 --> 00:00:29.893
<v 1>Ooh.</v>

9
00:00:30.230 --> 00:00:31.063
<v 0>You've been sounded good.</v>

10
00:00:31.070 --> 00:00:35.030
No idea what I'm doing kind of briefly saw people doing this, really?

11
00:00:35.031 --> 00:00:39.440
Just kind of going for it. There we go. Only really shouldn't do this. Okay.

12
00:00:39.441 --> 00:00:42.650
But, you know, screw it very demanding.

13
00:00:42.740 --> 00:00:47.060
I don't have a comb. I only have this comb really not the right comb,

14
00:00:47.090 --> 00:00:51.260
but it's fine. I'll I'll use the end of this. Okay. So, um,

15
00:00:52.130 --> 00:00:56.360
thank you. Do a triangle from here. Okay.

16
00:00:58.880 --> 00:01:00.290
<v 1>I think that's kind of.</v>

17
00:01:00.740 --> 00:01:05.540
<v 0>The vibe. I dunno. Let's start less. And then we'll go to more actually,</v>

18
00:01:05.541 --> 00:01:09.700
let me bring this down here. Okay. Oh my God.

19
00:01:09.860 --> 00:01:13.400
It's so much hair for like, I have then hair, but that's a lot of strands.

20
00:01:13.430 --> 00:01:15.830
I can do this. I can do this.

21
00:01:16.460 --> 00:01:17.293
<v 1>I don't even know.</v>

22
00:01:18.470 --> 00:01:20.900
<v 0>Purpose. You want to make sure that's all,</v>

23
00:01:20.930 --> 00:01:23.540
even it's all baby hairs on the side.

24
00:01:23.541 --> 00:01:25.880
I have more baby hairs on this side than I do on this side.

25
00:01:25.910 --> 00:01:29.330
The trick is to keep it. Apparently this is terrifying.

26
00:01:29.810 --> 00:01:34.550
I never had bangs in my life. Today's the day. Oh, I'm so nervous.

27
00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:38.060
And why do nerves kick in? It's so weird. It's just bangs, like chill,

28
00:01:38.360 --> 00:01:42.980
go down and then I turn and then I take

29
00:01:42.981 --> 00:01:46.850
this and I turn again. That doesn't feel right. All right. Let me do that again.

30
00:01:47.030 --> 00:01:48.200
Why is this so scary?

31
00:01:48.230 --> 00:01:52.430
So straight down at the bridge of the nose turn and then you grab it

32
00:01:53.210 --> 00:01:56.600
and then you turn to get, no, it looks messy. I'm going to do it one more time.

33
00:01:59.270 --> 00:02:03.680
Okay. Why am I shaking? Oh my God. Get out of your comfort zone.

34
00:02:03.710 --> 00:02:05.600
Not comfortable at all. Okay.

35
00:02:13.220 --> 00:02:17.930
<v 1>Oh, it's already been done. Okay. Oh my God.</v>

36
00:02:19.580 --> 00:02:22.160
Oh my God. Oh my God.

37
00:02:25.850 --> 00:02:26.683
Oh my God.

38
00:02:31.820 --> 00:02:32.300
Oh.

39
00:02:32.300 --> 00:02:34.160
<v 0>I'm not at the bridge of my nose. I did everything.</v>

40
00:02:34.160 --> 00:02:38.090
<v 1>Wrong, but I can't see if I'm cutting here.</v>

41
00:02:40.970 --> 00:02:44.060
<v 0>Well, the hairstylists are watching this being like, Oh girl, you done up.</v>

42
00:02:44.150 --> 00:02:47.570
That's uneven. Well, okay. Maybe I'll use my mirror.

43
00:02:51.980 --> 00:02:54.470
<v 1>Oh my God.</v>

44
00:02:56.180 --> 00:02:58.880
<v 0>Oh no. Oh no.</v>

45
00:03:01.360 --> 00:03:05.440
Oh, this is, Oh, this is Oh,

46
00:03:07.300 --> 00:03:10.930
okay. I mean, actually don't I don't hate it.

47
00:03:10.931 --> 00:03:14.890
A little uneven already. Pretty short. Thank God. I didn't go shorter.

48
00:03:14.920 --> 00:03:17.890
Definitely a diagonal line going on on the one side. Okay.

49
00:03:18.190 --> 00:03:22.060
I feel like I can fix this. I feel like I've never had bangs in my life.

50
00:03:22.240 --> 00:03:26.260
I've never had bangs in my life. Oh, this is weird. Oh, where's all my hair.

51
00:03:26.290 --> 00:03:27.310
There it is.

52
00:03:30.270 --> 00:03:31.230
<v 1>Nobody has.</v>

53
00:03:34.890 --> 00:03:37.860
<v 0>Why is this side so much longer?</v>

54
00:03:38.640 --> 00:03:42.300
Why something's happening? I'm not sure what this side is getting longer.

55
00:03:42.301 --> 00:03:44.850
Maybe if I reversed the twist.

56
00:03:46.710 --> 00:03:47.543
<v 1>Well.</v>

57
00:03:49.920 --> 00:03:54.630
<v 0>Gotcha. The hope. Why? Why? Why are you doing that to me?</v>

58
00:03:54.690 --> 00:03:58.950
Okay. I know Foucault.

59
00:03:59.160 --> 00:04:00.570
I didn't tell anybody I was doing this.

60
00:04:00.571 --> 00:04:05.250
I didn't even tell Falco I was doing this. Oh, that's okay. Okay. So let me,

61
00:04:05.280 --> 00:04:07.290
let me just, let me start like this.

62
00:04:07.350 --> 00:04:10.710
It looks like I just have a little colic there. I don't even have a strainer.

63
00:04:10.830 --> 00:04:14.460
Okay. Let's see. Wala. There we go.

64
00:04:15.170 --> 00:04:19.650
Looks great. Oh. This is hot. I think it's too long.

65
00:04:19.680 --> 00:04:22.770
I think we have to go shorter. I mean, it's kind of cool.

66
00:04:23.200 --> 00:04:26.430
Definitely needs to be actually, I don't know. I kinda like it,

67
00:04:26.431 --> 00:04:30.510
but it's always going to be in my eyes. It's too long. Right. Anybody can do it.

68
00:04:30.570 --> 00:04:35.130
You can do it. You know, I also heard about doing this

69
00:04:38.940 --> 00:04:43.530
to make it more like airy and light, I guess. You know? I think I fixed it.

70
00:04:43.590 --> 00:04:47.910
I think I did this. I can do this. If you want bangs, you get them bangs.

71
00:04:48.180 --> 00:04:49.170
What do you think so far?

72
00:04:57.570 --> 00:04:58.320
<v 1>[Inaudible].</v>

73
00:04:58.320 --> 00:05:01.740
<v 0>Oh, now I see the problem. It's just,</v>

74
00:05:01.741 --> 00:05:03.870
I don't have enough hair on the other side,

75
00:05:05.130 --> 00:05:09.750
but I'm not hating it harder to see, but I'm not hating it. All right.

76
00:05:09.810 --> 00:05:10.770
And there's the look.

77
00:05:14.820 --> 00:05:15.360
<v 1>[Inaudible].</v>

78
00:05:15.360 --> 00:05:20.190
<v 0>Do you have a new personality now? Yes. My changed woman. Yes. Am I proud?</v>

79
00:05:20.220 --> 00:05:24.120
Yes. Do I trust myself? Apparently. Do I recommend this?

80
00:05:24.150 --> 00:05:28.890
Yes I do. I'm very proud. Yo, you come here.

81
00:05:35.070 --> 00:05:35.903
<v 1>Come here.</v>

82
00:05:38.340 --> 00:05:43.050
<v 0>I cut beings. Come here.</v>

83
00:05:43.290 --> 00:05:43.440
Is.

84
00:05:43.440 --> 00:05:44.273
<v 1>That a wig?</v>

85
00:05:45.750 --> 00:05:48.450
<v 0>Is it a wig? My dog mom. Now.</v>

86
00:05:54.150 --> 00:05:58.040
<v 1>Are they too long idea? Do you like.</v>

87
00:05:58.040 --> 00:06:02.270
<v 2>It or is it not good? It looks good. It's just so different. But it looks good.</v>

88
00:06:02.780 --> 00:06:06.050
It looks, it looks good. Is that too long or no? No.

89
00:06:06.051 --> 00:06:10.820
The sides are supposed to be longer. It's like wispy. Do you like it?

90
00:06:10.880 --> 00:06:15.740
I think I look like a dog mom now. Right? Like I'm a mother. Yeah.

91
00:06:17.590 --> 00:06:21.190
<v 0>Honey. What do you think? Hello? What do you think?</v>

92
00:06:21.760 --> 00:06:23.500
<v 2>You go to the gym once and this.</v>

93
00:06:23.500 --> 00:06:28.120
<v 0>Happens. Yes. I need attention. How well? What do we think?</v>

94
00:06:28.690 --> 00:06:32.650
Do we like mommy like this? Yeah.

95
00:06:34.030 --> 00:06:36.940
Yeah. And my eyeballs.

96
00:06:37.420 --> 00:06:39.130
<v 2>Yeah. Is that annoying or no? No.</v>

97
00:06:39.130 --> 00:06:42.700
<v 0>You get used to it. I'm just not seeing. I can't see. Anyway.</v>

98
00:06:42.720 --> 00:06:46.780
I need like LASIK anyway. So it just like compliments that right. Papa.

99
00:06:55.960 --> 00:06:59.020
<v 2>Looks really good. I like it. Thank you.</v>

100
00:06:59.050 --> 00:07:01.810
Can't wait to see the final results. This is it.

101
00:07:02.380 --> 00:07:05.320
I thought you're going to do more. Do you say you want to cut it a little?

102
00:07:05.410 --> 00:07:09.220
<v 0>No. This is the final result. I like that.</v>

103
00:07:10.430 --> 00:07:11.350
I never said.

104
00:07:13.330 --> 00:07:13.840
<v 2>I never.</v>

105
00:07:13.840 --> 00:07:17.290
<v 0>Said it. You like it? That's my baby.</v>

106
00:07:19.330 --> 00:07:22.780
I am a legit mom. Now take that Sam. My sister's going to be like,

107
00:07:22.781 --> 00:07:26.830
you copied me. Hell yeah. I did. Hell yes I cut.

108
00:07:27.400 --> 00:07:31.750
I copied it. I did. I did. I did. Oh my God. He's so cute.

109
00:07:31.751 --> 00:07:36.250
A little booger bear guys. This is Falco the flirt. And you can follow him.

110
00:07:36.640 --> 00:07:41.380
This is my baby child. Okay. Sorry.

111
00:07:41.620 --> 00:07:42.520
You know, honestly,

112
00:07:42.521 --> 00:07:46.270
I don't know why I didn't do this sooner in life time for friends reactions.

113
00:07:46.360 --> 00:07:51.130
I forgot to turn on the mic for batches reaction.

114
00:07:51.131 --> 00:07:52.270
So here it is.

115
00:08:01.450 --> 00:08:05.680
Yeah. He said Beijing's well, anyways,

116
00:08:05.710 --> 00:08:09.670
now that my mics back on stupid kind of love it.

117
00:08:09.671 --> 00:08:14.170
I feel like I'm in the nineties or the eighties, the eighties.

118
00:08:15.640 --> 00:08:19.600
I would like to just, uh, you out to dinner.

119
00:08:20.590 --> 00:08:24.370
Why is a deep, beautiful hair? I'm sorry.

120
00:08:24.730 --> 00:08:26.140
I have to watch my puppy.
