00:00:01.290 --> 00:00:05.520
<v 0>All right. All right. So if you're wondering today,</v>

2
00:00:05.640 --> 00:00:09.960
we are shaving this beautiful head.

3
00:00:10.740 --> 00:00:12.840
I'm not prepared at all for this video.

4
00:00:12.870 --> 00:00:17.160
I just saw you sitting here in my makeup chair and was like, Hey,

5
00:00:18.090 --> 00:00:21.990
let's shave your head for you too. So I actually,

6
00:00:21.991 --> 00:00:24.900
and it's so random because guys, this is not planned.

7
00:00:24.930 --> 00:00:29.130
I brought up a pot with me for a whole other video,

8
00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:33.960
and now I'm just going to use it to shave out him. And you ran out of razors.

9
00:00:34.560 --> 00:00:38.790
So we're going to use my razor because I wasn't prepared for this video at all.

10
00:00:39.900 --> 00:00:41.220
And it's, it's new.

11
00:00:41.660 --> 00:00:45.740
<v 1>It's new. It's a new razor. Cause mine was very like, the blade was super doll.</v>

12
00:00:45.770 --> 00:00:49.190
And I was like, if we shoot this, we need a good razor.

13
00:00:49.220 --> 00:00:53.330
So can we go get the shaving cream? I'll look at this. Actually.

14
00:00:53.331 --> 00:00:56.240
I'm super excited about this because now I don't have to do it.

15
00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:04.010
I usually shave in the shower. So you use just shampoo?

16
00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:08.390
No, you have shaving cream.

17
00:01:17.660 --> 00:01:21.350
<v 0>So we're using, um, feminine products on Yohanas, which is,</v>

18
00:01:24.050 --> 00:01:27.170
I want to see it. Oh my God. This looks awesome.

19
00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:32.780
Move it around. It's really good. All right. Ready?

20
00:01:35.530 --> 00:01:39.260
This is so funny. You must, you must, you must, you must,

21
00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:45.350
you must have so much fun shaving every day. What's it like to be involved?

22
00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:50.060
<v 1>So, first of all, it's not a lot of fun, cause it takes up a lot of time. Um,</v>

23
00:01:50.660 --> 00:01:53.960
like I said, I really enjoy this right now because I don't have to do it.

24
00:01:54.560 --> 00:01:59.120
And it's always, it sounds weird, but you know, when somebody, I mean, not like,

25
00:01:59.121 --> 00:02:02.300
you know, cuts your hair, like gives you a massage, gives you a massage,

26
00:02:02.330 --> 00:02:06.030
whatever. Um, it's always better if someone else does it. So right now this,

27
00:02:06.050 --> 00:02:08.210
this feels good. Ooh. I get a head massage too.

28
00:02:09.010 --> 00:02:12.110
<v 0>The best makeup artists always massage your face before.</v>

29
00:02:12.440 --> 00:02:14.390
Technically this is like a part of your face, right?

30
00:02:15.470 --> 00:02:17.240
<v 1>A beautiful face needs a lot of space.</v>

31
00:02:20.780 --> 00:02:23.090
<v 0>Goodness. It's actually really</v>

32
00:02:28.040 --> 00:02:32.750
cook dinner. Ooh. You know what?

33
00:02:32.751 --> 00:02:37.520
I should do put a robot, you know,

34
00:02:37.521 --> 00:02:41.990
just in case, uh, the monetization gods are like, Hey.

35
00:02:43.150 --> 00:02:45.800
<v 1>You're wearing a sports bra. This should be</v>

36
00:02:47.450 --> 00:02:52.010
before you start, have you done this before? Yeah. Yeah.

37
00:02:53.240 --> 00:02:56.660
<v 0>You need to shave sewer way past due for this buddy.</v>

38
00:02:57.560 --> 00:02:58.393
Oh my gosh.

39
00:02:59.320 --> 00:03:03.460
Just even that sounds so good against the grain right.

40
00:03:05.880 --> 00:03:10.350
<v 1>That I would do later. I would just go like back first.</v>

41
00:03:10.590 --> 00:03:13.620
Cause the hair grows down. So it's like easy to shave this way.

42
00:03:13.860 --> 00:03:18.480
A lot of guys try to do it like down first, but for me,

43
00:03:18.540 --> 00:03:20.880
I don't know, like this is the long for me right now.

44
00:03:20.910 --> 00:03:23.850
Like usually I shave it way before that stage.

45
00:03:25.410 --> 00:03:29.760
<v 0>Libraries. Yeah. I know. I hope I've been focused.</v>

46
00:03:30.600 --> 00:03:34.710
All right. So this is getting in the top of the head.

47
00:03:35.820 --> 00:03:39.840
It's not the best to razor for this, but Oh my gosh.

48
00:03:39.841 --> 00:03:40.860
It's so satisfying though.

49
00:03:42.750 --> 00:03:45.540
<v 1>This part, like the top part is easy. Um,</v>

50
00:03:45.570 --> 00:03:48.840
the hard part is the back because first of all, I don't see it.

51
00:03:49.260 --> 00:03:53.280
And there's more hair on the back, like in the top. It's where it's receding.

52
00:03:53.610 --> 00:03:55.590
So it's, it's easier.

53
00:03:57.210 --> 00:04:00.990
But the back is just, it's annoying. Cause you, you have, um,

54
00:04:01.320 --> 00:04:06.090
the bones out of your skull. So it's like a little, or at least I have that.

55
00:04:06.091 --> 00:04:08.880
I don't know if everybody I'm pretty sure everybody has those, you know? Right.

56
00:04:12.510 --> 00:04:13.920
<v 0>Oh yeah. Bumps. We got them.</v>

57
00:04:14.340 --> 00:04:18.930
<v 1>Dave around them is pretty tough. Especially with no eyes like,</v>

58
00:04:20.490 --> 00:04:21.990
Oh no, I don't want to do that.

59
00:04:22.080 --> 00:04:23.870
I'm British here within the next couple of years,

60
00:04:23.880 --> 00:04:28.350
I will lose all of my hair and then I don't have, [inaudible] important.

61
00:04:28.800 --> 00:04:30.960
<v 0>You guys be embarrassed if they have no hair.</v>

62
00:04:31.800 --> 00:04:33.390
<v 1>Just rock it. But good. This,</v>

63
00:04:33.391 --> 00:04:38.370
I have a beautiful girl woman right next to me shaving my head.

64
00:04:39.990 --> 00:04:41.850
<v 0>I'm just afraid. I'm going to get your eyebrows.</v>

65
00:04:41.910 --> 00:04:46.140
<v 1>Oh yeah, don't do that. I need those. I need some hair in my face.</v>

66
00:04:47.760 --> 00:04:49.550
That's why we have be exactly.

67
00:04:50.460 --> 00:04:53.430
<v 0>Oh my gosh. Just the back. You guys going to love the back part.</v>

68
00:04:54.030 --> 00:04:58.470
I really hope I'm focused. I have no idea. But do you want to check? It's not

69
00:05:00.240 --> 00:05:01.073
my channel.

70
00:05:02.070 --> 00:05:05.730
<v 1>So to answer your question, should people or guys be embarrassed about, um,</v>

71
00:05:06.600 --> 00:05:09.210
you know, being involved? That's a super common thing and we, uh,

72
00:05:09.270 --> 00:05:11.130
like I share this with you all the time.

73
00:05:11.280 --> 00:05:15.000
Cause I get a lot of DMS from guys and I try to respond to every single one of

74
00:05:15.001 --> 00:05:19.170
them. Um, when they start losing their hair, they get,

75
00:05:19.350 --> 00:05:23.010
I don't want to say insecure, but like I think that's, that's the word, right?

76
00:05:23.040 --> 00:05:24.150
Like just insecure.

77
00:05:24.180 --> 00:05:28.710
Like they did lose their self-confidence and then wear hats all the time.

78
00:05:28.740 --> 00:05:32.360
I mean, I like wearing hats too, but not because I'm ashamed of not having hair,

79
00:05:32.410 --> 00:05:35.970
just like it. But yeah, some guys do that to cover up, you know,

80
00:05:35.971 --> 00:05:40.800
not having hair, but there's absolutely no need for that.

81
00:05:40.830 --> 00:05:43.770
It's just hair that has nothing to do with your personality.

82
00:05:43.771 --> 00:05:44.880
It has nothing to do with it.

83
00:05:44.880 --> 00:05:48.300
<v 0>It was all from a girl's perspective because the guy telling us other guys,</v>

84
00:05:48.301 --> 00:05:49.740
it's kind of like, it's cool,

85
00:05:50.010 --> 00:05:54.990
but they really want to know what the ladies thing. Cause a lot of times are,

86
00:05:55.000 --> 00:05:58.280
you know, actually some other guys want to know what other guys think too.

87
00:05:58.880 --> 00:06:01.190
So it's good to hear it from both of us.

88
00:06:01.220 --> 00:06:04.760
But what I will say is I think

89
00:06:06.230 --> 00:06:07.063
it's sexy.

90
00:06:07.460 --> 00:06:11.360
You're actually the only bald guy I've ever I've ever dated.

91
00:06:12.230 --> 00:06:13.063
You even had

92
00:06:16.250 --> 00:06:18.440
[inaudible] we have a baby, it'll come out

93
00:06:20.510 --> 00:06:24.920
low maintenance guys. We're not the cutest ball baby.

94
00:06:27.380 --> 00:06:32.240
And then we'll start the channel.

95
00:06:33.020 --> 00:06:37.400
What's our problem. Maybe I'll shave my head too. We actually have a video.

96
00:06:37.401 --> 00:06:41.930
I'll put at the end of this video of me bald with your harness that exists.

97
00:06:42.130 --> 00:06:45.610
<v 1>And that perform very well. But the acting was really good though, too.</v>

98
00:06:47.340 --> 00:06:50.980
<v 0>Two, two, this is taking a, why should I even edit this?</v>

99
00:06:50.981 --> 00:06:54.580
Or should I just leave this raw and just upload it straight question.

100
00:06:54.581 --> 00:06:56.350
How low do I go for the site?

101
00:06:57.070 --> 00:07:00.370
<v 1>Oh, you go, you can go like where my ear is.</v>

102
00:07:00.371 --> 00:07:05.290
Like I don't see it. So I'll trust you.

103
00:07:05.770 --> 00:07:07.780
<v 0>I feel like I want to shape you.</v>

104
00:07:08.110 --> 00:07:11.140
You know how the barbers like have those spine razors and they're like,

105
00:07:12.250 --> 00:07:15.520
we gotta get that guys, if you know of any good racers,

106
00:07:15.521 --> 00:07:19.660
like that comment below second start, like I know they're super dangerous.

107
00:07:20.800 --> 00:07:25.240
Um, cause they're so sharp. Uh, but it would be fun.

108
00:07:25.810 --> 00:07:26.860
What is this called again?

109
00:07:27.550 --> 00:07:29.560
<v 1>The barbershop Jeff's barbershop.</v>

110
00:07:31.300 --> 00:07:33.820
<v 0>Straightforward. I like it. When did you decide to commit? Yeah.</v>

111
00:07:34.030 --> 00:07:37.660
<v 1>I don't have the answer. Do you know when it was? I remember where it was.</v>

112
00:07:37.661 --> 00:07:40.000
It was a six and a hundred, three years ago.

113
00:07:40.360 --> 00:07:44.950
I remember it was in that tiny little room with a security guard, yelled at us.

114
00:07:45.070 --> 00:07:47.770
He was like, there's no filming in here. Sony 4k,

115
00:07:47.771 --> 00:07:52.540
whatever cyber shop. What was the camera? Like? Super tiny. Yeah.

116
00:07:53.770 --> 00:07:57.040
Um, how clean that is. And he was like, you're not allowed to film in air.

117
00:07:57.070 --> 00:08:00.940
When I went to, um, the military military service in Austria. I did it too.

118
00:08:01.660 --> 00:08:03.400
You've been there, done that. Yeah, exactly.

119
00:08:03.400 --> 00:08:05.350
<v 0>Strong military men do it.</v>

120
00:08:05.770 --> 00:08:10.600
<v 1>So if anybody out there is experiencing hair loss or whatever and you decide to</v>

121
00:08:10.601 --> 00:08:11.434
shave your head,

122
00:08:13.180 --> 00:08:16.960
like I need to shift everything the first week is going to feel and look just,

123
00:08:16.961 --> 00:08:21.310
everything's going to be super weird because you will feel the wind on your head

124
00:08:21.311 --> 00:08:24.300
and around your ears because you don't have any hair anymore. Um,

125
00:08:24.301 --> 00:08:26.980
and just looking in the mirror, it's going to be like, Whoa, that's weird.

126
00:08:26.981 --> 00:08:30.430
Or taking a shower is interesting. Cause you want to go through your hair,

127
00:08:30.431 --> 00:08:31.840
but it's not there anymore.

128
00:08:32.110 --> 00:08:37.000
So all of that was like the first week or like the first two

129
00:08:37.001 --> 00:08:41.770
weeks was there's so many experiences, so many like not emotions,

130
00:08:41.771 --> 00:08:44.980
which is like feelings. It was awesome. Um, and then I loved it.

131
00:08:45.460 --> 00:08:49.120
You know what I mean? So many emotions. It was, it was cool because it's like,

132
00:08:49.180 --> 00:08:52.750
it's new. It's like a new haircut. It's I mean, I know it's no hair,

133
00:08:52.751 --> 00:08:56.370
but like I think it's sounds funny, but it it's it's considered.

134
00:08:56.370 --> 00:09:01.260
<v 0>A haircut, right? Or no, it was cool.</v>

135
00:09:03.270 --> 00:09:07.970
So much work the labor and I want this to be, Oh my gosh. It's like,

136
00:09:09.020 --> 00:09:11.540
this is weird. It looks like, like fibers.

137
00:09:13.160 --> 00:09:16.970
It looks like those magnetic, like fluffy fibers there's toys.

138
00:09:19.100 --> 00:09:22.310
Trust me with my sword. Yeah. Can we do it quick?

139
00:09:23.090 --> 00:09:28.070
So yeah, this isn't going to be a daily thing though. It just

140
00:09:32.820 --> 00:09:37.490
[inaudible] I'll do it once a week. Ooh, what was okay. This is like,

141
00:09:37.880 --> 00:09:41.000
you know what the hell you're going to make up a number,

142
00:09:42.170 --> 00:09:45.440
a million views. Okay baby. Yeah, that's doable.

143
00:09:45.470 --> 00:09:50.450
I get like 20 million on some. It's been a while.

144
00:09:50.460 --> 00:09:55.130
Okay. Give me a break. I haven't posted on YouTube in forever.

145
00:09:55.190 --> 00:09:56.570
And now you guys,

146
00:09:56.571 --> 00:10:01.430
your comments asking me to and asking me for different videos is

147
00:10:01.640 --> 00:10:06.290
super motivating. So thank you. And now I'm posting again.

148
00:10:06.860 --> 00:10:11.630
Okay. How about a hundred thousand views? 15,000 comments?

149
00:10:12.380 --> 00:10:14.240
No. 15,000 legs. Sorry.

150
00:10:14.360 --> 00:10:18.650
A hundred thousand views on what timeframe in a week?

151
00:10:20.750 --> 00:10:22.460
No, no.

152
00:10:26.720 --> 00:10:31.400
Let's do 500,000 views in a week. Okay

153
00:10:33.260 --> 00:10:36.830
then shaming your own head buddy. If it gets 500,000 views,

154
00:10:36.890 --> 00:10:40.280
I didn't get that service once a week deal.

155
00:10:40.460 --> 00:10:42.680
Nice guys. Make sure.

156
00:10:43.100 --> 00:10:47.630
Make sure to share this video with all of your friends posted everywhere you

157
00:10:47.631 --> 00:10:52.610
can. Don't I'm hoping for no views on this video time,

158
00:10:52.880 --> 00:10:53.990
time is money.

159
00:10:54.080 --> 00:10:57.770
That's also why I'm like doing these types of videos for you guys too.

160
00:10:58.280 --> 00:11:01.040
Cause they're super like fun and easy to do.

161
00:11:01.430 --> 00:11:04.520
And also like with everything else going on,

162
00:11:04.910 --> 00:11:09.800
it makes it so I can be consistent and actually doing the things that I really

163
00:11:09.801 --> 00:11:13.310
do in my everyday life. Like Johann has had to shave set. And this happens,

164
00:11:13.311 --> 00:11:16.880
like I helped you on us, out with the back of a set a lot. Um,

165
00:11:17.040 --> 00:11:19.910
but you do pretty good on your end. I don't know what's going on here. Oh,

166
00:11:20.260 --> 00:11:24.740
this Oh, that's already shaved. That's weird. It's just sticking to your head.

167
00:11:25.880 --> 00:11:30.620
Oh wow. Okay. I was wondering why it wasn't going away spoliation. Oh my gosh.

168
00:11:30.621 --> 00:11:33.140
This must be great exposure creation. All right.

169
00:11:33.141 --> 00:11:35.840
So doing a little bit more.

170
00:11:36.530 --> 00:11:39.140
We're going to finish this baby off of us to a shaving cream again.

171
00:11:40.180 --> 00:11:42.100
I do laundry too. Okay.

172
00:11:44.630 --> 00:11:46.910
There we go. Hello, Mr. White.

173
00:11:47.180 --> 00:11:51.830
So I'm doing the neck now and then get those

174
00:11:52.370 --> 00:11:56.500
straggle Lees over. Get yourself a girl. That'll shave your head.

175
00:11:56.800 --> 00:12:01.480
So almost you good? Yep. Yeah.

176
00:12:01.481 --> 00:12:06.310
The first time I shaved your harnesses head was for I'm an Instagram skit.

177
00:12:06.880 --> 00:12:10.090
He told me to buzz it right off, but little did I know he wanted to shave it.

178
00:12:10.091 --> 00:12:11.620
Anyway. I liked that though.

179
00:12:11.740 --> 00:12:16.480
I like accepting I'm losing my hair and instead of trying to hide it,

180
00:12:16.540 --> 00:12:20.950
just shaving it off confidence. And a man is like one of the sexiest things.

181
00:12:21.040 --> 00:12:24.490
Not like cocky. Don't confuse it. Just like confident,

182
00:12:24.491 --> 00:12:28.750
good and secure with himself behind the gear and make sure you clean behind your

183
00:12:28.751 --> 00:12:31.840
ears guys. A lot of guys don't and it skirts.

184
00:12:32.140 --> 00:12:35.290
I discovered that I was checking behind all these guys. I'm like,

185
00:12:35.291 --> 00:12:38.620
let me see behind your ears. 95% was unbelievable.

186
00:12:39.640 --> 00:12:43.270
Dirty years. I'm going to put some oil on after two.

187
00:12:44.470 --> 00:12:49.150
It's a long day surname for every day. Oh my gosh. She's a mess.

188
00:12:51.070 --> 00:12:52.810

00:13:03.540 --> 00:13:05.840

191
00:13:11.840 --> 00:13:15.750
Wow. If that's not a nice looking head,

192
00:13:16.410 --> 00:13:18.240
I don't know what is,

193
00:13:23.130 --> 00:13:26.880
