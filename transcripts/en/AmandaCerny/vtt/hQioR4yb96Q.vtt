00:00:14.960 --> 00:00:17.960
<v 1>Welcome to tea time with sarnie I'm Amanda Cerny.</v>

2
00:00:17.990 --> 00:00:21.650
And this is where I play tennis with some of my friends and have a little Q and

3
00:00:21.651 --> 00:00:26.420
a session while we play. But today's special guest is going to be a Roche.

4
00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:43.310
Oh my gosh. And Elia is super famous.

5
00:00:43.550 --> 00:00:47.900
How many campaigns to campaign? Well, a lie of the tater top.

6
00:00:47.960 --> 00:00:51.110
Follow her. She's so freaking cute. This is distracting.

7
00:00:51.111 --> 00:00:55.400
I feel like this is a method for you to 100%. That's why she's here.

8
00:00:55.460 --> 00:00:59.930
She's here for me to take the w R have you played tennis before?

9
00:01:00.170 --> 00:01:03.050
I have, but I'm not really good at it. All right. Well, let's just play ball.

10
00:01:03.380 --> 00:01:05.600
Wait. That's baseball. Oh, okay.

11
00:01:06.290 --> 00:01:11.030
<v 2>Oh, Oh my God. Welcome ladies. Um,</v>

12
00:01:12.020 --> 00:01:16.670
I don't okay, here we go. Um, wow, you are adorable.

13
00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:20.390
You guys ready to play? Sorry. Distracted, distracted. Um, who is,

14
00:01:20.391 --> 00:01:25.190
what do you think? Heads or tails? Heads. Heads. Yeah. Okay.

15
00:01:25.191 --> 00:01:26.024
You, you achieve.

16
00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:28.850
<v 1>I think that's a tale.</v>

17
00:01:29.180 --> 00:01:31.310
<v 2>It was, it was heads. It was a hundred percent heads.</v>

18
00:01:32.360 --> 00:01:35.810
So you'll pick who serves first. I'll let her Madison, okay. Amanda.

19
00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:42.950
<v 1>Oh, wait. I know. I'm like, wait, here you go.</v>

20
00:01:44.510 --> 00:01:47.000
All right. Love all

21
00:01:48.740 --> 00:01:52.430
first question is how did you get started with, um,

22
00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:57.380
beauty and makeup and all that good stuff? I used to do it on myself.

23
00:02:08.050 --> 00:02:10.730
You used to do it on yourself? Yeah. I used to Dan,

24
00:02:10.740 --> 00:02:15.320
so I had to do stage makeup on myself since I was five,

25
00:02:16.370 --> 00:02:21.260
but I started when I was 17 and I would do everyone's makeup for $45

26
00:02:21.350 --> 00:02:26.270
in my bedroom. Yup. That's so cool. You're a little hustler. I know.

27
00:02:26.271 --> 00:02:29.600
Right? Making that money, honey, from an early age. Love it.

28
00:02:31.010 --> 00:02:33.380
You still haven't done my makeup. That was out

29
00:02:38.830 --> 00:02:42.860
going go into box. Are you sure? Yep.

30
00:02:44.060 --> 00:02:47.540
Well, I don't know. Maybe you're right. Pretty sure it was in though.

31
00:02:47.660 --> 00:02:50.990
I'm pretty sure. Totally out

32
00:02:52.830 --> 00:02:56.420
to try to hit inside the boxes. Second, serve second serve. Yep.

33
00:02:58.310 --> 00:03:02.980
You still haven't my makeup yet. One day, we're going to glam one day.

34
00:03:02.981 --> 00:03:04.330
You're going to make me pound man.

35
00:03:08.140 --> 00:03:09.010
<v 2>30. Love.</v>

36
00:03:17.490 --> 00:03:19.300
<v 1>Going to be my friend anymore after this.</v>

37
00:03:21.340 --> 00:03:24.670
Who's your favorite client? That's hard.

38
00:03:26.290 --> 00:03:29.890
Oh, it was out. That one was out. Oh,

39
00:03:31.090 --> 00:03:35.470
that was out. Okay. Now are we done?

40
00:03:36.490 --> 00:03:41.050
Not yet. My favorite class, I feel like my muse right now has to be Chloe,

41
00:03:41.290 --> 00:03:45.280
Chloe. I just really like it.

42
00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:46.930
This is not cool.

43
00:03:51.300 --> 00:03:52.133
<v 2>40. Love.</v>

44
00:03:52.410 --> 00:03:56.900
<v 1>You set all this up right? For you to play everyone so I can look good.</v>

45
00:03:56.910 --> 00:03:57.743
Playing all my friends.

46
00:03:58.680 --> 00:04:02.760
How do I talk and hit it at the same time on the side.

47
00:04:03.780 --> 00:04:08.780
You just had your, your birthday recently too, huh? Yeah. And you went to.

48
00:04:21.600 --> 00:04:22.433
<v 2>Sorry.</v>

00:04:22.650 --> 00:04:27.330
<v 1>Can you speak Spanish? No, no apply spaniel.</v>

50
00:04:33.240 --> 00:04:36.180
Can you speak any other languages? I can speak Armenian.

51
00:04:36.780 --> 00:04:39.600
Speak to me in Armenian Haydn. Wholesome

52
00:04:41.460 --> 00:04:44.610
second serve. What did you say? I said,

53
00:04:44.611 --> 00:04:46.950
do you speak Armenian hide and wholesomeness.

54
00:04:47.850 --> 00:04:51.360
If I say hi I'm yes. You say IO. IO.

55
00:04:51.990 --> 00:04:56.790
Highest IO. That's all I need to know. Yeah.

56
00:04:57.390 --> 00:05:02.130
Right here. Oh, the size. How often?

57
00:05:03.150 --> 00:05:06.390
So your whole family is from Armenia? Yes.

58
00:05:07.140 --> 00:05:09.090
How often do you go there? Oh,

59
00:05:14.790 --> 00:05:18.360
that was good, right? Yeah. I put my heart into it.

60
00:05:18.480 --> 00:05:22.410
So do they all live in the U S now, are they still live there? Um,

61
00:05:22.560 --> 00:05:27.450
my mom's side lives in Armenia and Russia. Yeah. My dad's side lives here.

62
00:05:27.870 --> 00:05:31.320
Oh cool. But I was born in Armenia

63
00:05:32.880 --> 00:05:33.960
when it was a communist.

64
00:05:38.790 --> 00:05:41.910
I think I'm winning numbers. But how

65
00:05:47.880 --> 00:05:51.780
What's one mistake that I always make with my makeup that you notice.

66
00:05:51.900 --> 00:05:54.090
<v 2>Advantage. Amanda, I feel.</v>

67
00:05:54.090 --> 00:05:58.880
<v 1>Like you don't need makeup. You're so beautiful. Oh, you are. Thank you.</v>

68
00:05:58.881 --> 00:06:03.110
But you can be honest. The lashes.

69
00:06:03.470 --> 00:06:08.300
Yeah. Yeah. So what do I need to do? You just need to stick it on. Oh,

70
00:06:08.450 --> 00:06:11.780
is the offering? No, like stick it on fully. Oh,

71
00:06:13.070 --> 00:06:17.510
I kind of dangle sometimes, but sometimes, but I feel like everyone's does.

72
00:06:18.770 --> 00:06:19.610
Oh, it's out.

73
00:06:21.710 --> 00:06:22.370
<v 2>No.</v>

74
00:06:22.370 --> 00:06:24.440
<v 1>Those were the hardest for me to figure out.</v>

75
00:06:26.750 --> 00:06:30.230
We need to do it. The toric I'll show you the easiest way to do it. Please.

76
00:06:31.520 --> 00:06:32.990
What's the trick to it.

77
00:06:34.040 --> 00:06:38.360
You have to place it in the center bef like when it's like tacky.

78
00:06:38.390 --> 00:06:43.160
Not when it's wet. Oh. And then you have to do the outer edge.

79
00:06:43.250 --> 00:06:47.450
Yeah. And then the inner corner. I don't do that.

80
00:06:48.320 --> 00:06:51.200
Yeah. Noted.

81
00:06:55.120 --> 00:06:56.980
<v 2>Ah, Amanda.</v>

82
00:06:58.810 --> 00:07:00.620
<v 1>But I have a pretty good background. No,</v>

83
00:07:01.060 --> 00:07:03.550
you're you're actually doing great hitting it like this.

84
00:07:03.551 --> 00:07:07.120
I feel like I'm hitting it like this. My backhand sucks. My everything sucks.

85
00:07:07.360 --> 00:07:11.770
No, I have a main backend. That's good. I'll know. Not,

86
00:07:11.771 --> 00:07:16.540
not to hit it that way now. So how did you start doing, um,

87
00:07:16.570 --> 00:07:20.170
the makeup for the Kardashians? It's been,

88
00:07:20.260 --> 00:07:25.060
I could say like four years and I feel

89
00:07:25.061 --> 00:07:29.110
like it's changed my life in many ways. Yeah.

90
00:07:29.500 --> 00:07:33.070
Like mindset. So wait, I from here, I sat there.

91
00:07:33.400 --> 00:07:37.570
<v 2>Yes. From here over there. Yeah. Very good.</v>

92
00:07:42.940 --> 00:07:47.110
<v 1>I don't know what you're talking about. Oh, she gets the point.</v>

93
00:07:49.120 --> 00:07:52.900
You got a puppy point. That's right. Elia.

94
00:07:52.901 --> 00:07:55.180
You keep sticking that tongue out and swinging.

95
00:07:55.181 --> 00:07:58.270
Those guys have looking cute talking to me.

96
00:07:59.560 --> 00:08:00.970
So how did it change your life?

97
00:08:01.720 --> 00:08:06.490
I feel like their perspective and like business.

98
00:08:06.590 --> 00:08:07.423
Yeah.

99
00:08:10.300 --> 00:08:11.560
<v 2>Oh, very nice.</v>

100
00:08:13.600 --> 00:08:14.980
<v 1>He got me on the backend,</v>

101
00:08:16.330 --> 00:08:19.240
like in business and just

102
00:08:21.850 --> 00:08:26.110
all come on. Now. That was out. That was out out.

103
00:08:27.040 --> 00:08:28.960
Oh, that was out.

104
00:08:31.720 --> 00:08:32.553
<v 2>40 Love.</v>

105
00:08:32.950 --> 00:08:37.720
<v 1>Have you had your eyes checked recently? All right,</v>

106
00:08:37.960 --> 00:08:38.793
here we go.

107
00:08:44.890 --> 00:08:49.330
If you say that's it I'm like, where did it go?

108
00:08:52.300 --> 00:08:53.500
So what are they like?

109
00:08:53.501 --> 00:08:56.820
What's one of the best things that learned about business from them.

110
00:08:58.980 --> 00:09:03.300
You have to be so persistent. Never take no for an answer. It's true.

111
00:09:03.330 --> 00:09:05.400
Wake up super early grind, Tilly,

112
00:09:05.401 --> 00:09:10.320
sleep and Delmar ever. Yeah. You know,

113
00:09:10.920 --> 00:09:13.110
that's true. And they all work so hard.

114
00:09:13.680 --> 00:09:17.220
So seeing that you want to work hard too.

115
00:09:17.640 --> 00:09:18.720
People don't know that.

116
00:09:19.880 --> 00:09:22.100
<v 2>40, 30. That's true.</v>

117
00:09:22.370 --> 00:09:26.060
<v 1>People think it's so easy for them. A lot of the time. I agree.</v>

118
00:09:26.061 --> 00:09:30.710
But I feel like people don't see how much they work. Yeah.

119
00:09:30.740 --> 00:09:34.760
From like their eyes, opening eyes, closing, it's all work.

120
00:09:35.360 --> 00:09:36.980
And they do so much charity.

121
00:09:36.981 --> 00:09:41.750
I feel like it's kind of corny to like display what you're

122
00:09:41.751 --> 00:09:44.300
doing and they don't. Yeah.

123
00:09:44.490 --> 00:09:47.900
I feel like they definitely deserve a lot more credit in that Avenue.

124
00:09:48.230 --> 00:09:50.960
I hear through like, outside people of the,

125
00:09:50.961 --> 00:09:55.040
like the stuff that they're working on and the stuff that they do. Um,

126
00:09:56.210 --> 00:09:56.930
I love it.

127
00:09:56.930 --> 00:09:59.480
<v 2>What can do with like the plastic?</v>

128
00:10:00.230 --> 00:10:02.960
<v 1>Yeah. I mean plastic bottles for the water and the ocean.</v>

129
00:10:03.620 --> 00:10:04.850
Like it's just so much stuff.

130
00:10:04.851 --> 00:10:07.760
Like they promote a tiny bit just to create awareness,

131
00:10:07.761 --> 00:10:12.530
but like not to gain like today they're doing a poker tournament.

132
00:10:12.830 --> 00:10:17.720
Yeah. For city of help. Oh, I know. Did you hear about him? No.

133
00:10:18.930 --> 00:10:23.330
I need to learn how to play poker. I need to learn to play tennis, bro.

134
00:10:25.610 --> 00:10:26.810
Are you a good poker player.

135
00:10:30.110 --> 00:10:30.943
<v 2>Advantage?</v>

136
00:10:33.410 --> 00:10:34.243
<v 1>Hmm.</v>

137
00:10:35.720 --> 00:10:39.560
I think you harness and you should get married like next week. What

138
00:10:41.300 --> 00:10:45.200
do you mean too soon? No, I really, really like,

139
00:10:46.970 --> 00:10:49.250
I have to ask to move into the house.

140
00:10:49.640 --> 00:10:53.960
We have to get a dog that this is process life.

141
00:10:54.440 --> 00:10:58.100
<v 2>You shouldn't be that immediate with it because you'd be like, ah,</v>

142
00:10:58.690 --> 00:10:59.523
we have time.

143
00:10:59.630 --> 00:11:02.690
<v 1>This is true. Life is way too short to plan.</v>

144
00:11:02.750 --> 00:11:04.640
Why do you think Yohanis is good for me?

145
00:11:08.510 --> 00:11:09.343
I go over.

146
00:11:13.220 --> 00:11:17.630
<v 2>What's your answer? That decides what happens with that point.</v>

147
00:11:18.950 --> 00:11:20.300
Huh? What's your answer?

148
00:11:21.950 --> 00:11:25.070
<v 1>Oh, why do I think Johan is that? He's a good guy. Look at him.</v>

149
00:11:25.071 --> 00:11:25.904
Taking care of him.

150
00:11:26.480 --> 00:11:29.360
<v 2>That's a game point right there. Yep. That was it.</v>

151
00:11:33.200 --> 00:11:35.000
<v 1>Like where are you going to find the guy like this?</v>

152
00:11:35.030 --> 00:11:38.120
I feel like you guys have a side deal going this whole game.

153
00:11:38.121 --> 00:11:41.840
You compliment your harness. Your harness gets to play with your dog.

154
00:11:41.870 --> 00:11:46.250
I think you're getting very paranoid at this point. Maybe the sun's getting too.

155
00:11:46.251 --> 00:11:49.190
You should have wore a hat for a while.

156
00:11:49.850 --> 00:11:54.340
See what we're doing here we one, huh? Yeah.

157
00:11:55.030 --> 00:11:56.800
We both won one round camp.

158
00:11:57.870 --> 00:12:01.080
<v 0>That was a really good answer. He's a good guy.</v>

159
00:12:03.600 --> 00:12:06.960
<v 1>What's your favorite trend? So far, 2018.</v>

160
00:12:08.070 --> 00:12:09.540
My favorite trend. Yeah.

161
00:12:16.470 --> 00:12:19.530
<v 2>That one was out. Love 15.</v>

162
00:12:22.770 --> 00:12:27.390

That was really out. Yeah. Oh, I served. Yeah.

164
00:12:31.830 --> 00:12:35.550
She's all like messing me up. Did you undermine me booboo?

165
00:12:38.250 --> 00:12:41.460
Well, I didn't. You're adding new rules to tennis here.

166
00:12:44.970 --> 00:12:46.260
So what's your favorite trend?

167
00:12:46.920 --> 00:12:51.450
I feel like my trend right now is that I'm into is how

168
00:12:51.451 --> 00:12:53.280
everyone's being a little bit more raw.

169
00:12:56.010 --> 00:12:56.843
<v 2>30.</v>

170
00:13:01.180 --> 00:13:03.510
<v 1>Native cheer. Well,</v>

171
00:13:03.511 --> 00:13:07.650
is that like how everyone's just being unfiltered on social media.

172
00:13:08.520 --> 00:13:12.130
I do love that. Oh, it's out.

173
00:13:14.370 --> 00:13:18.000
Yeah. I was out anyways. Otherwise I just going to play it.

175
00:13:30.060 --> 00:13:31.290
<v 1>I think you're hypnotized.</v>

176
00:13:32.640 --> 00:13:36.150
You're just full of distractions right now and I liked them.

177
00:13:36.960 --> 00:13:38.640
I'm not mad at the distractions.

178
00:13:39.570 --> 00:13:40.403

<v 1>And I like to laugh. That's true. You do? Yeah.</v>

189
00:14:18.840 --> 00:14:20.610
Let's tell the story of how we met.

190
00:14:23.250 --> 00:14:28.080
We met in Miami. You were with,

191
00:14:28.410 --> 00:14:33.240

uh, something crap. Uh, Joe's

193
00:14:40.050 --> 00:14:44.520
out. I think it's the Wyndham catchy.

194
00:14:46.830 --> 00:14:50.820
And then we just partied in Miami for love at first sight with us.

195
00:14:50.910 --> 00:14:52.910
It and it still is.

196
00:14:54.920 --> 00:14:58.340
What did I teach you to do? Oh,

197
00:14:58.341 --> 00:15:03.050
you taught me how to cover up at the restaurant. Aside from that,

198
00:15:05.750 --> 00:15:10.650
I have a question who's serving. She is. Why did you serve right now?

199
00:15:10.670 --> 00:15:12.950
Oh, okay. You serve point

200
00:15:17.450 --> 00:15:20.300
besides that? Um,

201
00:15:24.680 --> 00:15:26.600
what did you teach me? I don't know. Tell me

202
00:15:29.060 --> 00:15:32.000
regarding what? Oh,

203
00:15:34.820 --> 00:15:35.870
What did he teach me?

204
00:15:38.630 --> 00:15:42.020
Oh my God. Yes.

205
00:15:44.330 --> 00:15:46.910
He taught me how to make it rain. Yup.

206
00:15:47.390 --> 00:15:51.830
We went to club 11 and there's this like a unique nightlife

207
00:15:51.831 --> 00:15:55.970
experience. Yeah. And there's like, you know,

208
00:15:55.971 --> 00:16:00.440
a certain way to throw things. Yes. It's like a technique.

209
00:16:00.770 --> 00:16:03.980
Yeah. Yeah. She was teaching me how to make a mess. Surfing.

<v 1>I'm serving or you're serving. I'm serving. Okay. Yeah.</v>

214
00:16:21.431 --> 00:16:23.620
That was a much needed thing to know though.

215
00:16:24.190 --> 00:16:26.500
Cause I've embarrassed myself so many times. I mean,

216
00:16:26.501 --> 00:16:29.980
I don't really go to strip clubs often. No, when you go,
