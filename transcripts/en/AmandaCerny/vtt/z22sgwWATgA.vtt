00:00:18.410 --> 00:00:19.243
<v 1>Are you okay?</v>

3
00:00:22.700 --> 00:00:25.580
Do you need help? I'm good. Why?

4
00:00:28.580 --> 00:00:33.110
Oh yeah. You guys covered that up on land. Huh? I'm a mermaid. Oh,

5
00:00:33.590 --> 00:00:34.730
well, former mermaid.

6
00:00:39.110 --> 00:00:43.490
How do you guys use? See things. Oh my God.

7
00:00:44.390 --> 00:00:48.560
Back there. Yeah. Oh, that's where my blow hole is.

8
00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:56.420
So you're a mermaid, huh? Yeah. You may have heard of my friend, Ariel,

9
00:00:56.810 --> 00:01:00.830
the little mermaid to me, Ana. She's not so little,

10
00:01:01.520 --> 00:01:05.600
but when we were down there, she kept telling me how like amazing it is on land.

11
00:01:05.601 --> 00:01:07.160
And I was like, whatever.

12
00:01:07.161 --> 00:01:11.630
But then after the a hundred time of getting a fricking straw stuck up my nose,

13
00:01:12.050 --> 00:01:16.910
I need to find myself a sea witch and have her turn me into a unit.

14
00:01:18.140 --> 00:01:20.630
So here I am. Do you know where the princes are?

15
00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:24.180
Are you gonna have those here in Florida? It's one like

16
00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:28.760
two killers alligators.

17
00:01:30.980 --> 00:01:33.740
So where are they come with me?

18
00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:37.610
The only princess I know aren't from here

19
00:01:39.680 --> 00:01:40.513
in England.

20
00:01:43.790 --> 00:01:44.900
Gotta get on a plane to see them.

21
00:01:55.010 --> 00:01:58.190
How we might help.

22
00:02:01.250 --> 00:02:04.100
No, no, I don't work. I'm a princess.

23
00:02:08.540 --> 00:02:09.373
<v 0>[Inaudible].</v>

24
00:02:09.440 --> 00:02:12.350
<v 1>Want some friends. No, thank you. [inaudible]</v>

25
00:02:20.120 --> 00:02:22.070
What? Well, that's a straw.

26
00:02:24.410 --> 00:02:25.790
<v 0>You must got in your nose.</v>

27
00:02:27.230 --> 00:02:31.790
<v 1>That's what we drink. We drink the garbage.</v>

28
00:02:35.540 --> 00:02:36.020
<v 0>Yeah.</v>

29
00:02:36.020 --> 00:02:38.060
<v 1>I don't know what I was thinking. And coming here,</v>

30
00:02:39.140 --> 00:02:40.220
I'm going to go back to the sea,

31
00:02:40.221 --> 00:02:44.960
which tell you to change me back into a mermaid now. So thank you for your time.

32
00:03:04.300 --> 00:03:05.100
<v 0>[Inaudible].</v>

33
00:03:05.100 --> 00:03:09.780
<v 1>Does he make me into a mermaid to know,</v>

34
00:03:09.790 --> 00:03:13.890
Hey, I'm an excellent wing man. I can help you find a Prince.

35
00:03:15.990 --> 00:03:20.550
No. Okay. Oh, FYI.

36
00:03:20.580 --> 00:03:24.060
It's a really far way down to the sea watch and I can guarantee your lungs when

37
00:03:24.160 --> 00:03:28.020
it's explode. Honestly, it's better than going out. Another Tinder day.
