00:00:00.450 --> 00:00:03.330
<v 0>Hey, if you haven't already got it. Get yourself a copy of answer the internet,</v>

2
00:00:03.360 --> 00:00:05.790
the card game it's available right now. And the link in the bio,

3
00:00:05.791 --> 00:00:08.610
or you can get a Barstool, sports, Walmart, Amazon,

4
00:00:08.611 --> 00:00:11.970
or Spencer gifts play along with us. Let's get into it. I'm Jessica Rhodes.

5
00:00:11.971 --> 00:00:12.990
And I'm here to answer the internet.

6
00:00:20.420 --> 00:00:22.490
If you had to get a lip tattoo, what would it say?

7
00:00:23.900 --> 00:00:24.733
<v 1>Ooh.</v>

8
00:00:25.790 --> 00:00:28.340
<v 0>That's a really hard one Copenhagen</v>

9
00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:32.510
because I chewed for like seven years of my life.

10
00:00:45.740 --> 00:00:46.790
<v 1>[Inaudible] wow.</v>

11
00:00:47.090 --> 00:00:50.630
<v 0>From Oregon is what we do. Okay. What's the weirdest thing you've jerked off to.</v>

12
00:00:51.710 --> 00:00:54.560
I can't answer that because my lawyer told me not.

13
00:00:54.560 --> 00:00:55.393
<v 1>To.</v>

14
00:00:56.840 --> 00:01:00.500
<v 0>I could end up in a psych ward. Probably not a good idea. Just kidding.</v>

15
00:01:00.501 --> 00:01:01.334
Just kidding.

16
00:01:01.700 --> 00:01:03.740
<v 1>I don't know. That is so much better than answers</v>

17
00:01:08.150 --> 00:01:10.010
[inaudible]. Now, if I told you that I'd have to kill you.

18
00:01:10.940 --> 00:01:14.810
<v 0>What would you choose? If you could only guys, I'm also dyslexic.</v>

19
00:01:14.811 --> 00:01:18.020
So what would you choose if you could only have one of,

20
00:01:18.500 --> 00:01:20.750
for the rest of your life, regular sex or anal?

21
00:01:22.610 --> 00:01:23.443
<v 1>Well.</v>

22
00:01:23.720 --> 00:01:27.710
<v 0>I don't really think I have the required equipment for, regular socks.</v>

23
00:01:27.711 --> 00:01:28.790
I would have to say ammo.

24
00:01:31.510 --> 00:01:33.090
<v 1>Going anal. Yeah.</v>

25
00:01:36.500 --> 00:01:39.260
<v 0>Regular sex is the easy answer, but we go for the Gusto.</v>

26
00:01:43.070 --> 00:01:45.530
Alright. Would you rather everyone be naked all the time or closed all the time?

27
00:01:46.640 --> 00:01:47.540
These are silly.

28
00:01:52.130 --> 00:01:53.620
I personally. Okay. So I.

29
00:01:54.710 --> 00:01:59.420
<v 1>See you at the club. Those girls people be naked too. Okay. Hold on.</v>

30
00:02:00.680 --> 00:02:02.360
<v 0>Oh, okay. You see what you see what happens in life?</v>

31
00:02:02.361 --> 00:02:04.130
You change their perspective. You change the narrative.

32
00:02:05.180 --> 00:02:07.460
<v 1>Completely all the way.</v>

33
00:02:09.460 --> 00:02:12.620
<v 0>And again, people might start going to the gym. They might live healthier lives.</v>

34
00:02:12.621 --> 00:02:17.180
In which case naked. If every time you finished sex, a song played,

35
00:02:17.181 --> 00:02:19.010
what would it, what would you want it to be?

36
00:02:24.410 --> 00:02:25.190
<v 1>Oh, this is.</v>

37
00:02:25.190 --> 00:02:27.410
<v 0>So, so many options.</v>

38
00:02:27.410 --> 00:02:28.243
<v 1>Here.</v>

39
00:02:33.260 --> 00:02:38.240
Rap. I don't know. I don't like the.

40
00:02:42.140 --> 00:02:42.830
<v 0>You know,</v>

41
00:02:42.830 --> 00:02:45.620
I'm one of the few girls who actually truly enjoys getting calm on the face.

42
00:02:45.890 --> 00:02:47.630
So that would probably be it. Thank you.

43
00:02:50.090 --> 00:02:52.820
My boyfriend's a lucky man. Just putting it out there.

44
00:02:53.570 --> 00:02:56.420
Would you date your dream girl? If for two days every week, your choice,

45
00:02:56.421 --> 00:02:57.530
she had to dress like a juggler.

46
00:03:00.880 --> 00:03:04.480
<v 1>Uh, well, no. Um.</v>

47
00:03:06.180 --> 00:03:08.940
<v 0>You take the good with the bad, you know, that's what relationships are</v>

48
00:03:11.250 --> 00:03:12.600
in order for you to live. You have to kill it.

49
00:03:17.700 --> 00:03:19.590
<v 1>What have I wrote myself into here guys?</v>

50
00:03:20.160 --> 00:03:21.450
<v 0>Okay. In order to live,</v>

51
00:03:21.451 --> 00:03:25.170
you have to kill a blind child who has the greatest voice of our generation.

52
00:03:25.230 --> 00:03:26.090
Are you killing the kid?

53
00:03:28.950 --> 00:03:32.430
<v 1>Will they see it coming? Probably not.</v>

54
00:03:34.020 --> 00:03:34.853
Right.

55
00:03:37.950 --> 00:03:41.700
<v 0>Is it weird for a guy to prefer lube Handjobs over blow jobs? Absolutely.</v>

56
00:03:43.800 --> 00:03:44.730
<v 1>Like personally offended.</v>

57
00:03:45.600 --> 00:03:49.050
<v 0>Yeah. Who does that? Like what are you watching? Jules. Jordan.</v>

58
00:03:49.051 --> 00:03:53.040
You need baby oil by the bed. Like come on.

59
00:03:54.330 --> 00:03:55.163
<v 1>Yup. Yup.</v>

60
00:03:59.790 --> 00:04:00.600
[inaudible].

61
00:04:00.600 --> 00:04:03.330
<v 0>If you could be any character from a TV show, who would you be?</v>

62
00:04:07.140 --> 00:04:09.930
The Punisher only because I think he's so bad-ass and that's totally what I

63
00:04:09.931 --> 00:04:14.400
drove off to Frank castle all the way.

64
00:04:14.970 --> 00:04:19.380
Just walk into a room and everyone dies. Like no music playing. You just.

65
00:04:23.790 --> 00:04:24.210
<v 1>[Inaudible].</v>

66
00:04:24.210 --> 00:04:24.751
<v 0>Would you rather,</v>

67
00:04:24.751 --> 00:04:27.630
your girlfriend be able to read your thoughts during sex or all the time?

68
00:04:27.631 --> 00:04:32.100
Except during sex, thoughts, thoughts, no thoughts during sex,

69
00:04:32.101 --> 00:04:33.960
because then she gets something. Right?

70
00:04:38.120 --> 00:04:42.270
I don't even have to tell you. You already know. Uh,

71
00:04:42.990 --> 00:04:45.900
I told her my friend something recently, she was asking me about sex advice.

72
00:04:45.901 --> 00:04:49.740
And I was like, girl, if you can't talk about sex, you shouldn't be having it.

73
00:04:50.280 --> 00:04:53.610
My best friend's mom told me that at 13 and that stuck with me my whole life.

74
00:04:54.270 --> 00:04:57.180
Would you rather be an extremely good looking paralyzed person or a hideous,

75
00:04:57.181 --> 00:04:59.010
fully functioning person? A hideous,

76
00:04:59.011 --> 00:05:02.070
fully functioning person because plastic surgery is,

77
00:05:03.420 --> 00:05:07.290
it works these days. I, yeah, loopholes, loopholes.

78
00:05:07.320 --> 00:05:09.810
I can find a loophole in anything actually at gossip.

79
00:05:09.840 --> 00:05:12.810
The first time I danced there because it's not a full new club. Right.

80
00:05:12.870 --> 00:05:14.970
They were like, Oh, keep your panties on. And I was like, sweet.

81
00:05:15.210 --> 00:05:16.890
I have a pair of crashes panties, right in my bag.

82
00:05:18.870 --> 00:05:21.030
Would you rather a get paid 1 million a year,

83
00:05:21.031 --> 00:05:25.260
but have to work ridiculous hours or B get a hundred thousand a year for doing

84
00:05:25.261 --> 00:05:29.040
nothing. I'm workaholic. So I'd have to say answer a,

85
00:05:29.460 --> 00:05:34.320
are you choosing these yourself? Dan? You give me a good one.

86
00:05:34.321 --> 00:05:34.890
Come on.

87
00:05:34.890 --> 00:05:37.200
Would you rather see everything that has occurred in the history of the world?

88
00:05:37.320 --> 00:05:40.170
Where everything that is going to happen in the future? Whew.

89
00:05:40.800 --> 00:05:45.630
I feel like there's not enough Xanax in the world for you to show me the future.

90
00:05:46.530 --> 00:05:48.530
I'd probably there won't be a future for me. If I see that.

91
00:05:51.270 --> 00:05:56.250
<v 1>Yeah, dead on site, especially the window way we're going right now. Um,</v>

92
00:05:57.110 --> 00:05:58.070
plus history just repeats.

93
00:05:58.070 --> 00:05:58.461
<v 0>Itself.</v>

94
00:05:58.461 --> 00:06:01.490
So technically I could save the world if I knew everything that happened in the

95
00:06:01.491 --> 00:06:05.250
past. Right. I ha would you rather have a dog die every time?

96
00:06:08.290 --> 00:06:09.460
<v 1>This might be our worst question.</v>

97
00:06:11.110 --> 00:06:14.770
<v 0>This is going to hit me hard right in the heart because I love dogs and I laugh</v>

98
00:06:14.771 --> 00:06:16.330
a lot. So this is a problem. Okay.

99
00:06:16.331 --> 00:06:19.810
Would you rather have a dog die every time you laugh or have there be a genocide

100
00:06:19.811 --> 00:06:24.010
every time you fall in love? I would rather the genocide. Cause I don't.

101
00:06:25.950 --> 00:06:29.290
Yeah, I don't, I don't fall. I've been in love once in my life. So.

102
00:06:30.070 --> 00:06:31.990
<v 1>What, what would you want right off plan?</v>

103
00:06:40.450 --> 00:06:42.790
<v 0>Um, group of people. Yeah.</v>

104
00:06:46.570 --> 00:06:49.540
<v 1>Oh, okay. [inaudible].</v>

105
00:06:50.410 --> 00:06:52.120
<v 0>Uh, would you stop masturbating of ever girl?</v>

106
00:06:52.121 --> 00:06:54.790
You jerked off to knew you were doing it? No.

107
00:06:56.620 --> 00:06:58.000
<v 1>That's a hot girl answer.</v>

108
00:07:00.980 --> 00:07:03.850
<v 0>You know what though? I have to say guys, come up to me at events, no shame.</v>

109
00:07:04.000 --> 00:07:06.520
Or like that scene you did. Where you coming out of the Honda and you like,

110
00:07:06.550 --> 00:07:10.360
they give me explicit details and they're practically rubbing their pants and

111
00:07:10.361 --> 00:07:11.740
I'm like, I was, I was there.

112
00:07:11.860 --> 00:07:16.630
I don't need you to tell me all the yep. You're doing it. That's fine.

113
00:07:17.800 --> 00:07:22.090
That's fine. If there was stats available for every aspect of your life,

114
00:07:22.120 --> 00:07:24.880
what one stat would you want to see? What does it mean?

115
00:07:25.270 --> 00:07:26.110
<v 2>So like, uh,</v>

116
00:07:26.140 --> 00:07:30.640
let's say you die and you can look at like how many times

117
00:07:30.641 --> 00:07:33.310
you, how many movies you made, how many scenes you shot?

118
00:07:33.311 --> 00:07:37.240
How many times you ate your favorite meal? How many beers you drank?

119
00:07:37.241 --> 00:07:38.770
How many drugs you did? How many people?

120
00:07:39.750 --> 00:07:42.790
<v 0>Oh, let's not go there. Yeah.</v>

121
00:07:43.090 --> 00:07:47.350
<v 2>Like whatever, wherever you put a number on how many mice you fed your snippets?</v>

122
00:07:47.740 --> 00:07:50.830
<v 0>I would like, honestly, I know this is going to be like a sentimental thing.</v>

123
00:07:50.860 --> 00:07:54.730
I would like to see how many lives that I truly touched and why

124
00:07:58.360 --> 00:08:00.610
All it takes is five seconds to be kind to somebody and you never know what

125
00:08:00.611 --> 00:08:03.100
might make their day. All right. And let me find some of the murderer.

126
00:08:05.470 --> 00:08:08.950
Would you rather be the best looking girl in the world or be able to read minds

127
00:08:12.160 --> 00:08:12.161
Now?

128
00:08:12.161 --> 00:08:16.150
I'd rather be the best girl in the world because honestly the stupidity level of

129
00:08:16.151 --> 00:08:18.970
society right now, it would just be like reading a blank page.

130
00:08:21.280 --> 00:08:21.640
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

131
00:08:21.640 --> 00:08:25.510
<v 0>If you had one free throw, wait, if you had one free throw and if you make it,</v>

132
00:08:25.870 --> 00:08:28.600
you got a million dollars. But if you miss, you never get to text again.

133
00:08:28.780 --> 00:08:32.530
When you shoot it, I call people anyway. I'm old school. So yeah.

134
00:08:33.580 --> 00:08:34.413
I'm a caller.

135
00:08:35.230 --> 00:08:39.430
Would you rather be falsely accused of murder or never be able to stop coming?

136
00:08:45.940 --> 00:08:47.110
<v 1>I really don't know.</v>

137
00:08:48.400 --> 00:08:50.860
<v 0>Like it doesn't yeah.</v>

138
00:08:51.370 --> 00:08:53.620
<v 2>Ever stops. So you're just like walking around and come.</v>

139
00:08:53.740 --> 00:08:56.130
And you can't like focus, realize like how many endorphins.

140
00:08:56.130 --> 00:08:57.360
<v 0>Would be exploding in your brain.</v>

141
00:08:58.220 --> 00:09:00.140
<v 1>I also told you that he would eventually kind of like.</v>

142
00:09:00.680 --> 00:09:03.170
<v 0>Get used to it. No, I don't think so. How about we.</v>

143
00:09:06.170 --> 00:09:07.250
<v 1>Do I get to phone a friend?</v>

144
00:09:09.470 --> 00:09:12.500
<v 0>Would you rather have an Audi belly button or an uncircumcised Dick?</v>

145
00:09:12.890 --> 00:09:15.500
I'd rather have an uncircumcised Dick because they're great for anal.

146
00:09:15.590 --> 00:09:17.150
And as long as you clean it, right, it's fine.

147
00:09:17.990 --> 00:09:19.910
<v 1>Why is that true? I mean, I just</v>

148
00:09:25.400 --> 00:09:27.260
don't feel horrible about the reading. No.

149
00:09:27.261 --> 00:09:29.420
One of my favorite people to work with is my blue for animals.

150
00:09:30.440 --> 00:09:33.280
Why w why was the circumstance? So it doesn't. So basically instead of.

151
00:09:33.860 --> 00:09:37.340
<v 0>The inside of my, I still get all of the pleasure without the you're tearing my.</v>

152
00:09:39.500 --> 00:09:42.320
<v 1>Sound good. Thank you.</v>
