00:00:00.180 --> 00:00:04.350
<v 0>It's another edition of answer the internet delivered by Postmates I'm KFC host</v>

2
00:00:04.351 --> 00:00:07.200
of KFC radio at Barstool sports. For the last seven years,

3
00:00:07.201 --> 00:00:09.630
our podcast has been dealing with the weirdest,

4
00:00:09.631 --> 00:00:12.780
most difficult hypothetical questions the internet has to offer.

5
00:00:13.020 --> 00:00:16.440
Now we're putting celebrities and comedians to the test asking them the same

6
00:00:16.441 --> 00:00:20.040
questions. We got big Brown Brennan Shaw back here, once again,

7
00:00:20.041 --> 00:00:22.440

8
00:00:22.590 --> 00:00:25.200
it was the first episode of answer to the internet to really pop,

9
00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:27.450
put us on the map. So he's back once again,

10
00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:30.510

00:01:06.350 --> 00:01:10.400
uh, here we go. Um,

20
00:01:11.690 --> 00:01:16.670
uh, definitely fart loud every time he come. Yeah. Yeah. Just let it go.

21
00:01:16.671 --> 00:01:20.060
You know what I'm saying? Like give him a heads up. I'm about to bust.

22
00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:25.280
It's like a fog horn. It'd be sick about the bus.

23
00:01:28.190 --> 00:01:31.880
Uh, you got offered a billion dollars to never leave the state of Ohio.

24
00:01:32.030 --> 00:01:36.500
Do you take it? Nope, I'm doing all right. And I like to travel,

25
00:01:36.501 --> 00:01:41.180
so I'm good. Nah, not that I don't not like Ohio,

26
00:01:41.181 --> 00:01:42.530
but for billing. Nah.

27
00:01:42.830 --> 00:01:46.820
Would you lose all your own memories or never be able to make your new ones?

28
00:01:48.170 --> 00:01:52.970
Ooh, I have a kid. So it's different animal, different animal. Uh,

29
00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:54.050
he's getting pretty awesome.

30
00:01:54.051 --> 00:01:57.620
So I'd lose all my old memories of him when he's like one,

31
00:01:57.621 --> 00:01:58.580
two and three years old. Yeah,

32
00:01:58.581 --> 00:02:01.070
but now he's now the cool kicks in when he's a baby,

33
00:02:01.100 --> 00:02:04.880
I'm just kind of like decide peace. Make sure he stays alive. Now. He's like,

34
00:02:04.881 --> 00:02:07.670
you know, he's older. He knows who I am. Now's the time.

35
00:02:08.090 --> 00:02:12.290
If you could have any two people fight in a no rules, cage match.

36
00:02:12.320 --> 00:02:17.300
Who would you choose? Dad? I don't hate anybody. Um,

37
00:02:17.330 --> 00:02:19.010
balls deep in game of Thrones.

38
00:02:19.011 --> 00:02:22.310
So I'd like a real fight between the hound and the mountain.

39
00:02:22.311 --> 00:02:26.990
That'd be pretty dope for like an official win, like a real like death match.

40
00:02:27.680 --> 00:02:31.670
BCIT maybe seen him lately. He had a stroke.

41
00:02:31.671 --> 00:02:34.790
Half his face is all up. The hound looks pretty gnarly.

42
00:02:35.570 --> 00:02:38.930
How much money would it take for you to not know how to read?

43
00:02:39.880 --> 00:02:43.340
Do we even need to read? I can barely read. I'm balling. So whatever,

44
00:02:43.730 --> 00:02:47.690
what else we got for $10,000?

45
00:02:47.691 --> 00:02:51.320
Would you carry around an animated body pillow that looks like a human for one

46
00:02:51.321 --> 00:02:54.950
month. Have to introduce it as your boyfriend and girlfriend. Nope. Again,

47
00:02:55.280 --> 00:03:00.070
fall back to balling going. We'll change that number. Uh, let's do a.

48
00:03:00.070 --> 00:03:03.280
<v 2>Let's do a hundred thousand. Nope, Nope. Half</v>

49
00:03:05.410 --> 00:03:10.030
a million, a million dollars for one

50
00:03:12.220 --> 00:03:13.480
second. Carry a pillow for a month

51
00:03:17.470 --> 00:03:19.870
with dad, his dad, a serial killer billion dollars.

52
00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:26.490
<v 1>You are in an open field, armed with a baseball bat.</v>

53
00:03:26.491 --> 00:03:31.320
How many ten-year-olds this is dark. How many? 10 year olds wearing it?

54
00:03:31.740 --> 00:03:33.330
Could you take down before they get you?

55
00:03:35.490 --> 00:03:37.260
<v 2>Uh, man, uh.</v>

56
00:03:38.160 --> 00:03:41.100
<v 1>I mean, how many are running at me? I would say a few hundred,</v>

57
00:03:41.340 --> 00:03:43.740
a few hundred getting can cost like a. You know what I'm saying?

58
00:03:43.920 --> 00:03:46.470
Barry bonds and these little 10 years old, I'd be all right.

59
00:03:46.620 --> 00:03:50.250
The first kid is just, and they're like,

60
00:03:50.460 --> 00:03:55.200
Oh man. Yeah. And the rest of my, like,

61
00:03:55.210 --> 00:03:59.700
I guess if you could have sex with any person you want at any time,

62
00:03:59.701 --> 00:04:01.380
but you can only watch when

63
00:04:03.130 --> 00:04:06.030
you watch women's sports forever. Would you do it?

64
00:04:07.770 --> 00:04:09.990
God, MBA's getting good right now.

65
00:04:10.890 --> 00:04:15.510
Sex with any person you want at any time I'm taking the sex sports overrated.

66
00:04:18.360 --> 00:04:22.410
I'm watching the store. The WMB just balls deep in the Seattle storm.

67
00:04:22.411 --> 00:04:24.930
Like get it, girl. Get it. This is a nail biter.

68
00:04:25.110 --> 00:04:29.790
Would you rather go to jail for one year or go to jail with a Rubik's cube and

69
00:04:29.791 --> 00:04:34.050
you can leave when it's done. I have a Rubik's cube seems pretty tough.

70
00:04:34.090 --> 00:04:36.570
I seen children competed. We don't have a Rubik's cube in here. Right?

71
00:04:36.840 --> 00:04:40.290
I'll do the Rubik's cube. Yes. I feel like I'd get it done.

72
00:04:40.500 --> 00:04:45.360
<v 2>Have you done it? Have you done it? No. Hell no. He has never done it one time.</v>

73
00:04:45.361 --> 00:04:46.194
I didn't stick the thing.

74
00:04:46.530 --> 00:04:50.010
<v 1>You don't think as grown men, you could figure out in a year.</v>

75
00:04:50.520 --> 00:04:52.020
I don't like the confidence in half.

76
00:04:52.260 --> 00:04:55.740
I don't like your opinions on game of Thrones and I don't like your confidence

77
00:04:55.741 --> 00:04:56.610
in Rubik cubes.

78
00:04:59.760 --> 00:05:00.690
<v 2>And now all of a sudden you're gonna stop.</v>

79
00:05:03.030 --> 00:05:06.600
<v 1>Would you rather watch your dad have sex with the a hundred year old man? Wow.</v>

80
00:05:06.780 --> 00:05:11.220
Watch your mom kill someone. It's getting dark bros.

81
00:05:11.850 --> 00:05:15.450
I know this is my second time, but let's take it easy, you know?

82
00:05:17.880 --> 00:05:18.713
<v 2>Um.</v>

83
00:05:18.750 --> 00:05:21.330
<v 1>I guess watch my dad's sex.</v>

84
00:05:25.080 --> 00:05:26.040
<v 2>No in man. You know.</v>

85
00:05:26.760 --> 00:05:31.020
<v 1>I don't want someone to die. Uh, man, it's dark.</v>

86
00:05:31.440 --> 00:05:34.200
If you could pick one sliver to have your back in a bar fight,

87
00:05:34.230 --> 00:05:35.340
who would you pick?

88
00:05:40.710 --> 00:05:41.140
<v 2>Uh.</v>

89
00:05:41.140 --> 00:05:44.340
<v 1>Celebrity, uh, Frank Grillo. You know who that is?</v>

90
00:05:45.150 --> 00:05:50.040
He's in the purge stuff. He's tough. Frank grill is an actual legit, uh, boxer,

91
00:05:50.460 --> 00:05:55.200
Frank Grillo or the rock. Right? And you think tough?

92
00:05:55.230 --> 00:06:00.140
Yeah, those are too easy. Right? You're building your Dick from scratch.

93
00:06:00.200 --> 00:06:03.110
You make it as big as you want, but for every inch you add,

94
00:06:03.111 --> 00:06:06.980
you lose two years off your life. How big do you make it? Ah, dude,

95
00:06:06.981 --> 00:06:08.840
I'm cool with, I got seventh. Fine.

96
00:06:11.240 --> 00:06:14.930
Would you have sex with a girl with no arms? Yeah.

97
00:06:15.470 --> 00:06:16.460
Flight for sure.

98
00:06:16.490 --> 00:06:21.170
Like Cindy Crawford and a prime was like surfing and the shark was like,

99
00:06:21.410 --> 00:06:24.110
like you're like, I'm still hooking up with Cindy Crawford. I don't give a.

100
00:06:24.740 --> 00:06:28.100
If you could only watch one category of porn for the rest of your life,

101
00:06:28.130 --> 00:06:32.540
what would it be? Big butts. I go for the big buts.

102
00:06:33.050 --> 00:06:35.750
It's it's all sorts of race makes it's great in the

103
00:06:37.430 --> 00:06:39.050
easy brassieres what's up.

104
00:06:39.940 --> 00:06:39.940
<v 3>Yeah.</v>
