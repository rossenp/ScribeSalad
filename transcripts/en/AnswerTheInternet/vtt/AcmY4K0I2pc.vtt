00:00:00.180 --> 00:00:02.310
<v 0>Season two of answer. The internet is here.</v>

2
00:00:02.340 --> 00:00:05.490
Bill Berg kicks things off and the card game is now available.

3
00:00:05.491 --> 00:00:08.940
It's all the questions as up as you are to ask all your up friends,

4
00:00:09.300 --> 00:00:12.300
get it at Barstool sports, Amazon, Walmart, and Spencer gifts.

Click the link below.

6
00:00:13.310 --> 00:00:16.000
<v 1>And the description. Hey, I'm bill Burr and I'm here to answer the.</v>

7
00:00:22.040 --> 00:00:22.873
<v 2>[Inaudible].</v>

8
00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:26.060
<v 1>All right. I'm not good at reading out loud. All right. Answer the internet.</v>

9
00:00:26.061 --> 00:00:30.890
Do you think you could throw a football farther than a 1940s Heisman

10
00:00:30.891 --> 00:00:35.270
winner? No, never, never in my life. Could I, I just was,

11
00:00:35.271 --> 00:00:39.050
I was good at catching things. I wasn't good at running, throwing. I mean,

12
00:00:39.051 --> 00:00:43.610
I think the longest ever threw one was maybe 40 yards and I still feel that pain

13
00:00:43.611 --> 00:00:47.120
in my shoulder. That's a really good throat. And then it was 30.

14
00:00:47.720 --> 00:00:49.520
I just don't maybe I was on the metric system.

15
00:00:49.550 --> 00:00:53.780
I don't remember if you guys are impressed. It was never impressive. All right.

16
00:00:53.781 --> 00:00:58.310
Would you rather hit a home run as a pitcher score? That's a good one.

17
00:00:58.580 --> 00:01:03.020
Score a goal as a hockey goalie or score. TD is alignment.

18
00:01:03.021 --> 00:01:06.950
This is a no brainer pitcher demoralizing.

19
00:01:06.951 --> 00:01:08.810
It's the pick six of baseball.

20
00:01:09.140 --> 00:01:13.580
And my favorite one ever was when a what's his face cologne. Oh.

21
00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:16.430
And when all those guys had the presence of mind to go into the,

22
00:01:16.660 --> 00:01:19.760
into the locker room. So he wouldn't be there. Then they treated him like,

23
00:01:19.780 --> 00:01:23.180
like this new rookie that was going to come up and he was going to hit 400 more.

24
00:01:23.630 --> 00:01:25.550
That was my favorite thing ever.

25
00:01:25.551 --> 00:01:29.690
And I always loved how seriously Pedro Martinez took hitting.

26
00:01:29.900 --> 00:01:32.960
Like he actually used to take BP and all that. I loved it. All right.

27
00:01:33.830 --> 00:01:36.950
Answer the internet. Would you rather see it? That's an old school show biz.

28
00:01:36.980 --> 00:01:40.040
I keep saying the name of the big case. You cut this up.

29
00:01:41.420 --> 00:01:43.130
<v 2>The answer or the internet here.</v>

30
00:01:44.900 --> 00:01:49.280
<v 1>Uh, would you rather always be hard or never be able to get hard?</v>

31
00:01:49.730 --> 00:01:52.460
My age? I thought you meant like ripped. Um,

32
00:01:52.490 --> 00:01:55.370
would you rather always be hard or never be able to get okay.

33
00:01:55.371 --> 00:01:59.510
Is there a way to remove the semen from my body so I can artificially become a

34
00:01:59.511 --> 00:02:03.290
parent or whatever? What do they stick a needle in your balls?

35
00:02:06.620 --> 00:02:07.453
<v 2>Uh.</v>

36
00:02:07.910 --> 00:02:11.180
<v 1>I'm going no and I'll tell you why I am.</v>

37
00:02:11.210 --> 00:02:13.040
I am old enough to know,

38
00:02:13.041 --> 00:02:15.920
like you remember those devices of torture that they had,

39
00:02:16.100 --> 00:02:20.000
where like they put you in it. And as much as it hurt, the more you move,

40
00:02:20.001 --> 00:02:23.750
the tighter it got. That's what it's like to be in a relationship with a woman.

41
00:02:24.410 --> 00:02:27.020
So you're not going to win.

42
00:02:27.021 --> 00:02:31.640
And your dumb Dick is what leads you into it. So if I can neutralize my Dick,

43
00:02:31.641 --> 00:02:33.950
I can't imagine the things I could have accomplished.

44
00:02:37.820 --> 00:02:38.330
<v 2>Debates.</v>

45
00:02:38.330 --> 00:02:41.120
<v 1>The internet. I feel like I'm doing a old school talk show.</v>

46
00:02:41.300 --> 00:02:45.500
You have a choice between a sum of money and world peace.

47
00:02:46.490 --> 00:02:49.370
How much money would you, would it take for you to give up world?

48
00:02:49.430 --> 00:02:54.230
I go for world peace period and a story. No, no, no, no.

49
00:02:54.470 --> 00:02:58.040
I'm doing great. I have enough of the Americans. I would absolutely.

50
00:02:58.220 --> 00:03:00.600
I read a thing today. Know cover the paper. How,

51
00:03:00.760 --> 00:03:04.900
when cashmere they doing something there and this woman's son 22 got bit by a

52
00:03:04.901 --> 00:03:08.080
snake and couldn't get past the people to get into just seeing the mother's

53
00:03:08.081 --> 00:03:11.080
anguish. There's a number. Wow.

54
00:03:11.220 --> 00:03:14.340
<v 2>I don't even think there's enough. I don't think you went big.</v>

55
00:03:15.300 --> 00:03:18.960
There's not enough wild wings. Do I got a number?

56
00:03:20.400 --> 00:03:22.020
<v 1>Be Tom cruise in a fight. No way.</v>

57
00:03:22.230 --> 00:03:27.030
Cause he would weird me out with how Intuit he'd be. He just gets into.

58
00:03:29.970 --> 00:03:33.750
I would worry that he would do that. Val Kilmer, like that thing with his teeth.

59
00:03:34.410 --> 00:03:36.750
And I don't think I'd be able to get over the fact that it was,

60
00:03:36.751 --> 00:03:38.730
it was Tom cruise and I'm like,

61
00:03:38.870 --> 00:03:41.550
why I get to see if he really knows how to fight all those, uh,

62
00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:46.020
mission impossible. I think I would lose. I think I would lose, you know,

63
00:03:47.640 --> 00:03:50.100
overwhelming with that Scientology energy. Right?

64
00:03:50.760 --> 00:03:53.820
<v 2>Uh, I know where the space.</v>

65
00:03:54.360 --> 00:03:57.750
<v 1>I'd be like what the? And then I'd go beyond me. It would be it. Uh,</v>

66
00:03:57.780 --> 00:04:01.140
do you think the president jerks off in the oval office?

67
00:04:01.170 --> 00:04:04.560
Not only do I think he does. I think they all do. And you have to,

68
00:04:04.860 --> 00:04:07.920
as a man the first day, what can we do for you president?

69
00:04:07.921 --> 00:04:09.960
And they already know what you're going to say. I uh,

70
00:04:10.560 --> 00:04:15.360
would just like to have everybody get out of the office for about four minutes.

71
00:04:15.960 --> 00:04:18.270
Thank you. And everybody knows what you're doing, you know?

72
00:04:18.900 --> 00:04:21.330
And I think even the Illuminati shuts off their cameras,

73
00:04:22.500 --> 00:04:25.470
that's probably like they're locked the door test as he jerked off in the oval

74
00:04:25.471 --> 00:04:27.420
office. Yes. Yes he has. All right, good. We've got another one.

75
00:04:27.690 --> 00:04:29.580
The Wars will continue.

76
00:04:32.070 --> 00:04:32.903
<v 2>All right.</v>

77
00:04:33.120 --> 00:04:38.040
<v 1>Uh, answer, answer the internet. I want an old sport coat. Next time I do this.</v>

78
00:04:38.940 --> 00:04:43.740
Uh, if you find, if you found a porn online of your buddy

79
00:04:45.450 --> 00:04:50.220
and his girlfriend, would you watch it? Would you say anything to him? No,

80
00:04:50.250 --> 00:04:55.080
I wouldn't. Oh no. I would tell him I would not watch it. No way,

81
00:04:55.170 --> 00:04:56.100
dude. That's weird.

82
00:04:57.270 --> 00:04:58.830
<v 2>Pause forever. No.</v>

83
00:04:59.160 --> 00:05:00.840
<v 1>No. That's, that's a young person thing. Like,</v>

84
00:05:01.360 --> 00:05:03.630
like how polluted your hard drives are, you know,

85
00:05:04.410 --> 00:05:07.080
the fact that you'd have your buddies come face in your head. I mean,

86
00:05:07.081 --> 00:05:10.770
I don't know. That's why I never understood the two on one with another guy.

87
00:05:11.550 --> 00:05:13.980
Do you know? I know I can't because it's somebody else's story.

88
00:05:14.040 --> 00:05:16.830
I'll tell you the guy who it is and you got to ask them. All right. All right.

89
00:05:17.880 --> 00:05:20.010
Answer the internet. Uh,

90
00:05:20.011 --> 00:05:24.930
would you rather have no music for the rest of your life or have all

91
00:05:24.931 --> 00:05:28.080
music be sung by your significant other?

92
00:05:29.700 --> 00:05:32.940
Oh my wife's adorable and I love music. Yeah. W well, my wife,

93
00:05:32.970 --> 00:05:37.620
she actually has a good voice. I'd ever sing. Oh, then,

94
00:05:38.280 --> 00:05:42.990
um, no then he can't because that would be a double whammy, but after a while,

95
00:05:42.991 --> 00:05:45.540
but if there was no music and he was the only one singing,

96
00:05:45.780 --> 00:05:49.230
he would be the benchmark and he'd come out in a boxing ring,

97
00:05:49.231 --> 00:05:53.850
like Sinatra at Madison square garden. How many are there? Jesus Christ.

98
00:05:54.840 --> 00:05:58.490
it. This is what they get these, all these guys with their extra. Okay.

99
00:05:59.090 --> 00:06:01.130
Didn't you listen to Dan show? I'm Hollywood bill.

100
00:06:01.131 --> 00:06:04.820
I don't have time for this answer. The internet, um,

101
00:06:04.850 --> 00:06:07.340
who would win in a fight in their prime?

102
00:06:08.360 --> 00:06:11.270
Michael Keaton or Jon Bon Jovi.

103
00:06:13.450 --> 00:06:15.100
<v 3>Wow. Okay.</v>

104
00:06:15.700 --> 00:06:19.900
<v 1>Dude. That's like when like, I don't know,</v>

105
00:06:19.901 --> 00:06:24.760
like ball state is playing Arapaho community college. It's like,

106
00:06:24.761 --> 00:06:27.970
I don't know any players on these teams. I don't know how these guys fight.

107
00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:31.420
Let's see Jon Bon Jovi in his prime. He had that hair.

108
00:06:31.540 --> 00:06:35.520
You might keep his Batman lay your hands on me. I'm trying to figure it out.

109
00:06:37.330 --> 00:06:38.740
I want you to say, what would you say Michael?

110
00:06:38.741 --> 00:06:42.490
Keaton's prime was physically a night shift night shift over here.

111
00:06:42.491 --> 00:06:45.370
If I were to work out for that, I would say this.

112
00:06:46.270 --> 00:06:50.110
I would say that Michael Keaton in founder,

113
00:06:50.710 --> 00:06:55.570
or when he played the cop and the other guys could beat Bon Jovi.

114
00:06:55.720 --> 00:06:59.080
When he tried to buy the Buffalo bills. That's that's as far as I know,

115
00:06:59.140 --> 00:07:02.500
I would go, Michael Keith, last one. Last one.

116
00:07:02.501 --> 00:07:06.400
Before we take a break with your local sponsor, answer the internet.

117
00:07:06.760 --> 00:07:11.200
Would you rather go back to being 18 years old, knowing everything?

118
00:07:11.590 --> 00:07:16.300
Do I get Propecia this time? Uh, uh,

119
00:07:16.330 --> 00:07:20.200
everything you know now or get a million dollars?

120
00:07:21.640 --> 00:07:25.480
Would you rather go back to being an 18 year old? No way.

121
00:07:27.280 --> 00:07:31.240
No, there is no number to go back to being 18 again. Huh? Yeah.

122
00:07:31.330 --> 00:07:35.770
And music makes sense to me. I had those red locks.

123
00:07:36.310 --> 00:07:39.610
Are you kidding me? Oh my God. And all the stadiums and all that,

124
00:07:39.640 --> 00:07:44.620
then I would know what games to be at. Huh? I would go. Yeah, no,

125
00:07:44.621 --> 00:07:46.480
I would go back to being 18 in a second.

126
00:07:47.140 --> 00:07:50.800
What am I going to sit there and a jacuzzi with a cigar or be 18 again?

127
00:07:50.830 --> 00:07:53.680
That's one of the easiest questions ever. Thank you, ladies and gentlemen,

128
00:07:53.681 --> 00:07:56.350
this has been answer the internet.
