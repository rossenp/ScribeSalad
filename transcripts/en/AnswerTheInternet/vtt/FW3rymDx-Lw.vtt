00:00:00.420 --> 00:00:04.080
<v 0>Hi, I'm Andrea Savage. And I'm about to answer the internet. Watch my show.</v>

2
00:00:04.081 --> 00:00:07.830
I'm sorry. True TV 10:00 PM. Wednesday night.

3
00:00:09.350 --> 00:00:10.183
Um,

4
00:00:14.930 --> 00:00:15.590
all right.

5
00:00:15.590 --> 00:00:18.650
Would you rather sit down with your parents and watch every sexual encounter

6
00:00:18.651 --> 00:00:22.760
you've had or watch your parents' sex tape when they conceived you easy?

7
00:00:22.790 --> 00:00:24.440
Watch my parents' sex tag when they can see it for me,

8
00:00:24.740 --> 00:00:27.050
I feel like it would be a real sensual,

9
00:00:27.080 --> 00:00:29.570
really intense thing that I'd really like to be a part of.

10
00:00:30.320 --> 00:00:34.160
Would you rather lose the sensitivity flavor of your taste buds? Ooh.

11
00:00:34.250 --> 00:00:36.440
Or lose the sensitivity feeling of sex.

12
00:00:39.680 --> 00:00:43.100
Um, who am I having sex with? My husband.

13
00:00:44.030 --> 00:00:47.810
Let me go look. That's a date, I think. Yeah,

14
00:00:50.840 --> 00:00:53.840
right now it's just my husband. Then I'd rather keep my taste buds.

15
00:00:55.940 --> 00:00:59.030
If you were a war general in the civil war and you got the choice of bringing a

16
00:00:59.031 --> 00:01:02.570
T-Rex or modern war tank on your side, what are you taking?

17
00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:08.670
I don't know. Uh, that's such a, uh,

18
00:01:08.671 --> 00:01:09.860
I'll take a T-Rex.

19
00:01:10.130 --> 00:01:14.120
Can you imagine people's like on the they're on the field and I'm just like,

20
00:01:14.150 --> 00:01:18.350
bring out my T-Rex. I, I think we're done here. I think the war is over.

21
00:01:20.210 --> 00:01:21.680
You are the first girl to do this.

22
00:01:23.930 --> 00:01:28.160
I haven't been accused of having balls.

23
00:01:29.060 --> 00:01:33.680
Well, we rather do the first 90% of a blow job or the last 10%

24
00:01:35.090 --> 00:01:39.770
90. Let's be honest.

25
00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:42.380
It's not, it's not that much work when you're good at it.

26
00:01:42.700 --> 00:01:43.700
It doesn't take that long.

27
00:01:44.420 --> 00:01:48.650
Would you take $4 million to be on to catch a predator? No way.

28
00:01:50.030 --> 00:01:51.350
Yeah. I'm ready to ship.

29
00:01:51.530 --> 00:01:54.710
Would you rather walk with a rollerblade on your left shoe for the rest of your

30
00:01:54.711 --> 00:01:58.850
life or having a little person walking in front of you walking slightly slower

31
00:01:58.851 --> 00:02:03.710
than you want to for the rest of your life? Little person has a bad temper.

32
00:02:05.660 --> 00:02:08.570
Both of these are horrible. Uh,

33
00:02:08.600 --> 00:02:12.050
I would definitely rather walk with a roller blade on my left shoe.

34
00:02:14.510 --> 00:02:18.890
Um, I feel like there's a certain just level of uncomfortableness,

35
00:02:18.891 --> 00:02:20.330
but it's not the midget part.

36
00:02:20.480 --> 00:02:25.220
The idea of someone walking slightly too slowly in front of me will make me,

37
00:02:25.490 --> 00:02:27.290
I would kill myself. So then I'd be dead.

38
00:02:27.291 --> 00:02:29.450
So then what's the point of living my life. Wouldn't be long.

39
00:02:29.690 --> 00:02:31.220
That would make me insane.

40
00:02:31.280 --> 00:02:34.070
Let alone if they were in a car driving slightly slowly,

41
00:02:34.280 --> 00:02:37.880
would you rather watch sports or porn upside down for the rest of your life?

42
00:02:37.910 --> 00:02:42.290
But doesn't does a question. I refuse. If you had D one human body part,

43
00:02:42.291 --> 00:02:44.840
what would it be? I mean, these,

44
00:02:47.540 --> 00:02:52.370
the internet boys, the boys. Yeah.

45
00:02:53.480 --> 00:02:55.850
Um, I need something small. I don't want to eat a lot of flesh.

46
00:02:55.940 --> 00:02:57.590
Probably like the little toe.

47
00:03:00.490 --> 00:03:03.610
First of all, I'm not asking to eat a body part.

48
00:03:03.611 --> 00:03:05.260
You have made me answer a question.

49
00:03:05.320 --> 00:03:08.380
I'm not saying some sort of like low hanging fruit,

50
00:03:08.381 --> 00:03:10.780
like some sort of sexual things, but I'm taking the smallest,

51
00:03:11.830 --> 00:03:15.310
the only person who's made sexual, the first girl, no guys can be like.

52
00:03:16.080 --> 00:03:20.820
<v 1>No, everyone has compared to like a chicken and been like a thigh.</v>

53
00:03:21.300 --> 00:03:25.980
<v 0>Why did he such a big piece? I could get a little toe down in one swallow.</v>

54
00:03:26.460 --> 00:03:28.770
No, that's gross. So we're not talking about a cat. We're talking about,

55
00:03:28.800 --> 00:03:33.300
I have to get down one human parts. How do you know?

56
00:03:33.301 --> 00:03:36.360
I don't like a toe. I thought you had to taste.

57
00:03:37.090 --> 00:03:42.060
So you know that OSI, if you had to chew into that side.

58
00:03:42.930 --> 00:03:45.270
<v 1>Eaten in the world, well, you got to cook it and stuff.</v>

59
00:03:46.810 --> 00:03:48.420
You're the first person to make it sexual. Cause like,

60
00:03:48.421 --> 00:03:51.900
it would be easy to say eat a vagina, but you're the first person to be like,

61
00:03:53.120 --> 00:03:55.710
Oh, it's a sexual thing. It was, everyone's gone.

62
00:03:57.450 --> 00:04:01.230
<v 0>It's very broey around here. I don't know what's going on. Okay.</v>

63
00:04:01.440 --> 00:04:04.530
I don't know why I have this accent here today. I'm going to California.

64
00:04:04.800 --> 00:04:09.750
Would you rather have your mom read your mind during sex or have your girlfriend

65
00:04:10.300 --> 00:04:15.090
boyfriend read your mind? The rest of the time? Like, Oh,

66
00:04:15.150 --> 00:04:16.320
just all the time.

67
00:04:16.560 --> 00:04:16.860
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

68
00:04:16.860 --> 00:04:19.590
So he can always see your thoughts or your mom can always see your thoughts only

69
00:04:19.591 --> 00:04:20.424
during sex though.

70
00:04:21.060 --> 00:04:25.410
<v 0>I'll go with my mom during sex. She's a woman.</v>

71
00:04:25.440 --> 00:04:26.910
She's probably thought the same stuff.

72
00:04:27.660 --> 00:04:30.450
I don't want my husband knowing what I'm thinking all the time.

73
00:04:31.440 --> 00:04:32.610
We've been together too long.

74
00:04:33.090 --> 00:04:36.570
If you could die and come back as any inanimate object, what would it be?

75
00:04:38.970 --> 00:04:42.210
Um, Jesus, that's a hard question. Um,

76
00:04:42.810 --> 00:04:44.310
I would probably come back.

77
00:04:45.660 --> 00:04:48.720
I don't know why I was thinking like a portrait and like somebody's house,

78
00:04:49.470 --> 00:04:52.800
like an interesting, but you know what I mean? Like, yeah.

79
00:04:52.830 --> 00:04:54.690
Or like even like in the white house kind of a thing. Well,

80
00:04:54.691 --> 00:04:58.170
just know you'd be witnessed and you get to like hear and see like a lot of

81
00:04:58.171 --> 00:05:01.020
interesting stuff go down. Um,

82
00:05:01.050 --> 00:05:03.840
you have a choice between a sum of money and world peace.

83
00:05:03.870 --> 00:05:06.240
How much money would it take for you to give up world peace?

84
00:05:08.850 --> 00:05:09.990
I'm not giving up world peace.

85
00:05:12.360 --> 00:05:13.080
<v 1>Everybody has enough.</v>

86
00:05:13.080 --> 00:05:17.850
<v 0>I have enough money. I'm fine. Or is it all my money taken away? Now I'm broke.</v>

87
00:05:18.080 --> 00:05:22.320
<v 1>You got $0 world peace or a hundred billion dollars.</v>

88
00:05:22.560 --> 00:05:24.930
<v 0>I don't need a hundred billion dollars that causes a lot of problems.</v>

89
00:05:25.500 --> 00:05:28.350
<v 1>Well, a piece or 10, if you're broke, you use like.</v>

90
00:05:28.380 --> 00:05:31.830
<v 0>Well, if I'm broken, I have to like survive and I've got my kid,</v>

91
00:05:33.240 --> 00:05:36.870
I don't know, a couple hundred thousand for a year.

92
00:05:38.730 --> 00:05:40.080
I mean, she's got to go to private school.
