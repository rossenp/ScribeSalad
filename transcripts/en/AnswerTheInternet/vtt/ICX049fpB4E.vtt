10
00:00:29.360 --> 00:00:33.950
My special complicated Abe says, Oh, screaming for free on Amazon.

11
00:00:34.610 --> 00:00:36.950
And if you don't have Amazon, you know, buy it somewhere else.

12
00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:40.130
Come see me at 10:00 PM, bro. June 20th, 21

13
00:00:46.790 --> 00:00:50.990
[inaudible] who wins a fight. Tenure 10 ten-year-olds are 100,

14
00:00:51.470 --> 00:00:55.580
100 year olds. Dude. That's a really good question.

15
00:00:55.880 --> 00:00:58.910
Ten-year-olds 100%, especially if I'm coaching for them,

16
00:00:59.750 --> 00:01:02.660
you know what I'm saying? I just had to go low,

17
00:01:02.720 --> 00:01:07.460
take them out and then jump on their chest. Chest, chest your heart.

18
00:01:07.461 --> 00:01:11.210
Can't take that yellow ticker. It'll take her.

19
00:01:11.390 --> 00:01:15.020
Cause you got a bomb ticker to begin with. And then when you get in the CPR,

20
00:01:16.160 --> 00:01:19.850
Ooh, a ten-year-old most ten-year-olds way, at least a hundred pounds.

21
00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:24.590
Enjoy that. Grandma walking. I can ten-year-olds all day.

22
00:01:25.220 --> 00:01:28.070
You had the flexibility to blow yourself. Would you? First of all,

23
00:01:28.071 --> 00:01:31.730
I do have the flexibility. I'll drop into the splits right now. Naked.

24
00:01:31.731 --> 00:01:36.620
You can see my three piece set. It looks like a dead baby bird. Ah,

25
00:01:37.070 --> 00:01:41.600
what if everybody knew? Yeah. What if everybody knew you did, I'd be like this?

26
00:01:41.870 --> 00:01:45.560
Cause I can give me the next pocket of bang.

27
00:01:46.400 --> 00:01:48.650
You blow yourself. Aren't you a Christian.

28
00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:52.820
Would you rather be the best looking dude in the world to be able to? Yes. Yes.

29
00:01:53.240 --> 00:01:56.720
What's the next question. Or be able to read chicks minds.

30
00:01:58.010 --> 00:02:01.370
I don't want to be, you know, I just, for me, it's,

31
00:02:01.600 --> 00:02:05.900
it's very complicated up there. Like I have a daughter who's 10 or 11 now.

32
00:02:06.020 --> 00:02:09.800
I don't know 20. I don't know. You know, I'm not into fatherhood.

33
00:02:09.801 --> 00:02:14.390
It's all either way. She's a girl and I just don't, I can't figure her out.

34
00:02:14.420 --> 00:02:15.440
I can't her brain.

35
00:02:15.470 --> 00:02:17.600
I don't know if she can understand what she just starts crying.

36
00:02:17.630 --> 00:02:21.590
I'm like what's going on. Sometimes girls like to hear themselves cry, you know,

37
00:02:21.740 --> 00:02:22.491
I can't fix it.

38
00:02:22.491 --> 00:02:26.360
So obviously I want to be the best I can do it in the world so I can get an STD,

39
00:02:27.980 --> 00:02:31.670
take a pill. All right, thank God. Huh? For antibiotics guys,

40
00:02:31.700 --> 00:02:32.533
you know what I'm saying?

41
00:02:33.710 --> 00:02:37.550
What's one thing a person would say or do that makes you immediately hate them.

42
00:02:37.790 --> 00:02:41.930
Oh God. Usually where they're like, you know, for me it's like,

43
00:02:41.931 --> 00:02:46.190
I'm a very giving person or I've always been an overachiever

44
00:02:47.360 --> 00:02:50.690
or I can wear these shoes all day and my feet don't hurt.

45
00:02:51.620 --> 00:02:55.850
Well you and you're not in my inner circle and this is why China's killing us.

46
00:02:58.010 --> 00:03:02.350
Okay. hate. When guys talking about their comfortable shoes,

47
00:03:02.860 --> 00:03:07.690
Crocs, would you rather have two average kids or one kid who goes on to be a pro

48
00:03:07.691 --> 00:03:10.600
athlete and one kid who never learns how to read?

49
00:03:11.380 --> 00:03:15.640
That's fantastic feared. Well, nowadays you can listen to books on tape.

50
00:03:15.641 --> 00:03:20.590
So who needs to read what is reading? That's so 2005.

51
00:03:21.400 --> 00:03:25.210
So the answer is, um, I'd love to have a kid as a pro athlete.

52
00:03:26.290 --> 00:03:30.010
Depending on what kind of sport it is. But yeah. Being in the stands,

53
00:03:30.790 --> 00:03:34.990
tennis, you love tennis. I just, it's just,

54
00:03:34.991 --> 00:03:39.820
I like being around the rich. I can't stand the common cattle, dibs,

55
00:03:39.821 --> 00:03:44.650
disgusting beer, swelling, drones.

56
00:03:45.700 --> 00:03:50.500
God, I can't believe everybody's allowed to vote there. I said it.

57
00:03:50.770 --> 00:03:55.510
If you were gay for a day, who would you bang? You can pick whenever you,

58
00:03:55.810 --> 00:04:00.130
I had a long conversation with well, probably Brennan shop,

59
00:04:00.430 --> 00:04:04.930
but um, I don't know. He's got a great mouth. Um, I had a, um,

60
00:04:05.590 --> 00:04:10.360
a long conversation with Tom cruise and he has a small face and I was so star

61
00:04:10.361 --> 00:04:13.600
struck and I just wanted him to be my friend that I, I was like,

62
00:04:13.601 --> 00:04:15.670
if that guy asked me to make out right now,

63
00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:19.390
I probably wouldn't be able to say no, cause he's so famous. I'd be like,

64
00:04:21.190 --> 00:04:25.330
okay, you know what I mean? And then I drank deeply of his millionaire mouth.

65
00:04:25.770 --> 00:04:29.040
What'd you make of a Beaver's challenge who was in a fight Bieber, Tom cruise.

66
00:04:29.490 --> 00:04:31.770
Well, I know that I bang Justin Bieber

67
00:04:33.570 --> 00:04:37.890
cause that's a good looking young lady. I mean guy, whatever talented. Uh,

68
00:04:37.950 --> 00:04:41.010
I got Tom cruise off day. Tom cruise was a wrestler,

69
00:04:41.370 --> 00:04:45.110
a wrestling and Justin does some boxing, but good luck, Tom,

70
00:04:45.300 --> 00:04:49.380
that force of will that guy's in better shape. He drinks bad blood.

71
00:04:49.381 --> 00:04:51.450
He hangs upside down. Did you ever have,

72
00:04:51.480 --> 00:04:56.040
would you rather have a three inch deck? No, no, no. Or only last 30 seconds.

73
00:04:56.880 --> 00:04:58.560
30 seconds of a three inch stick.

74
00:04:59.700 --> 00:05:02.070
He spent so much time with your tongue.

75
00:05:04.110 --> 00:05:07.560
That's such man. Check ins. Right?

76
00:05:07.620 --> 00:05:10.170
I got to walk around having a big Dick of it only last 30 seconds.

77
00:05:10.500 --> 00:05:15.480
Let me show you, show you guys when I'm working. I heard rumors. Yeah, I do.

78
00:05:15.481 --> 00:05:19.710
Well I heard, I heard you're heard you're a man hanging from a penis. Yeah,

79
00:05:19.740 --> 00:05:23.010
I do. All right. I do. All right. Not going to kids yourself. I'll keep you.

80
00:05:23.340 --> 00:05:26.490
I'll keep you happy and busy. All right. You know what I'm saying?

81
00:05:27.270 --> 00:05:28.710
Clustering the bedsheets by the pillow.

82
00:05:31.950 --> 00:05:34.710
Oh God. I'm sorry.

83
00:05:36.660 --> 00:05:41.040
But is it there too? Who is the hottest celebrity?

84
00:05:41.041 --> 00:05:42.720
He makes noise too. He's got lungs.

85
00:05:43.320 --> 00:05:45.540
Who is the hottest celebrity that you think you'd have a shot with?

86
00:05:45.541 --> 00:05:50.430
If they got to know you? Um, Margot, Robbie,

87
00:05:51.360 --> 00:05:56.220
Margot. Robbie. Yeah, because I just, you know,

88
00:05:56.221 --> 00:06:00.020
I like to do things like I just kind of like a drop Shay. I'm older.

89
00:06:00.021 --> 00:06:02.900
I'm too old to be too forward, but I'm always like, I just, I don't know.

90
00:06:02.901 --> 00:06:05.660
I'm just trying to find an old fashioned. I know you're not the girl from me,

91
00:06:05.661 --> 00:06:09.110
but if I could find a girl that was into big comedy and money,

92
00:06:11.180 --> 00:06:13.450
maybe you don't like the laughing come that hard. So I don't know.

93
00:06:15.330 --> 00:06:19.720
See that's how she going to say no to that? Would you rather,

94
00:06:19.721 --> 00:06:21.430
every time you come, it comes out of your,

95
00:06:22.250 --> 00:06:26.650
out of your mouth or it's or it's a two liter bottles worth.

96
00:06:27.910 --> 00:06:32.230
Ah, no, I throw up every time. Um,

97
00:06:32.590 --> 00:06:35.350
two liters bottles worth. I just, it just be fun and be like, Hey, come on.

98
00:06:35.470 --> 00:06:39.820
I'm about to make and rain. You're welcome. You know what I'm saying?

99
00:06:40.450 --> 00:06:45.160
And I just, I just be in the orgy scene, lining up everybody, the world loses.

100
00:06:45.550 --> 00:06:49.630
This is such a guy show the world either loses all women or all sports,

101
00:06:49.660 --> 00:06:54.580
which you choose. I mean, yeah,

102
00:06:54.640 --> 00:06:57.610
it has to be all sports guys. I don't want to live in a world.

103
00:06:57.730 --> 00:07:01.120
We do sports for women's white guys. Fight bulls is why they going to war.

104
00:07:01.480 --> 00:07:05.140
I mean, without women we'd be so lazy. We'd be,

105
00:07:05.500 --> 00:07:09.700
we'd be shooting just here. Wouldn't matter. We just we'd be disgusting.

106
00:07:09.701 --> 00:07:12.960
I don't, you know what I'm saying? We've never, we would never shower,

107
00:07:13.450 --> 00:07:18.250
shame and just be disgusting. Women are important. They keep us on point.

108
00:07:18.460 --> 00:07:20.890
I just want to say that I, I honor women.
