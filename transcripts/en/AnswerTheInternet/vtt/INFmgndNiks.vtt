00:00:00.150 --> 00:00:04.020
<v 0>Hey, I'm Shawn Evans, host of hot ones, and I'm here to answer the internet.</v>

2
00:00:05.400 --> 00:00:06.233
<v 1>Um.</v>

3
00:00:10.580 --> 00:00:11.630
<v 0>Would you rather,</v>

4
00:00:12.260 --> 00:00:16.130
you have your girlfriend's hair or she has your hair?

5
00:00:16.520 --> 00:00:19.940
That is an easy example. My,

6
00:00:19.941 --> 00:00:24.860
my girlfriend has just beautiful, beautiful, healthy,

7
00:00:24.861 --> 00:00:28.520
flowing hair. If I could get that, uh, Lauren's hair,

8
00:00:29.990 --> 00:00:33.380
I'd trade in a second. And mine, I got a mess over here.

9
00:00:33.381 --> 00:00:36.770
If she had this I'm out, when you're drunk,

10
00:00:36.890 --> 00:00:41.060
is it better to get laid or have the ideal drunk meal?

11
00:00:41.780 --> 00:00:46.370
Good question. You know, the conventional thing is to say,

12
00:00:46.371 --> 00:00:49.850
get laid and I'm trying to make a case for the perfect meal.

13
00:00:51.050 --> 00:00:54.770
And I can't, the answer is get laid.

14
00:00:55.550 --> 00:00:59.600
All right. If you were in an open field with an aluminum baseball bat,

15
00:00:59.750 --> 00:01:01.910
how many ten-year-olds with bike helmets?

16
00:01:01.911 --> 00:01:03.890
Could you take down before they got you?

17
00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:08.330
Those kids would be in trouble 10 years old. I'm trying to think.

18
00:01:08.331 --> 00:01:10.430
What's that like fourth grade, third, fourth grade.

19
00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:16.040
I probably take out at least eight or nine ten-year-olds with helmets.

20
00:01:16.390 --> 00:01:20.840
I think you're selling yourself short. You think, I mean,

21
00:01:22.130 --> 00:01:24.650
you did not have triple digits. Come on.

22
00:01:24.651 --> 00:01:26.810
You can think you can take out a hundred kids.

23
00:01:26.811 --> 00:01:31.250
You know how exhausting that would be washed your watch to

24
00:01:33.470 --> 00:01:38.090
be gassed after five swings? No, if they're coming from all sides,

25
00:01:38.091 --> 00:01:41.900
one jumps on your back, like another one climbs on him. I'm down to my knees.

26
00:01:41.901 --> 00:01:43.730
Just trying to swing that thing. And it's over.

27
00:01:43.731 --> 00:01:47.900
Do you think there are more porn stars or murderers in the world?

28
00:01:49.040 --> 00:01:49.491
Uh, you know,

29
00:01:49.491 --> 00:01:54.290
I think there have to be more murderers.

30
00:01:54.470 --> 00:01:58.370
I don't know how many porn stars are there, like 400, 500 more than that.

31
00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:03.290
Yeah, it depends on what you qualify. I'm going to say I'm gonna,

32
00:02:03.350 --> 00:02:04.910
I'm going to treat porn.

33
00:02:04.911 --> 00:02:08.870
Like it's a professional sports league and I'm gonna say that you have

34
00:02:09.350 --> 00:02:11.990
400 to 700 porn stars.

35
00:02:12.230 --> 00:02:16.820
In which case you have way more murders. And uh, you know,

36
00:02:16.821 --> 00:02:20.150
and I know this I've been listening to a lot of true crime podcasts lately.

37
00:02:24.290 --> 00:02:27.740
Yeah. And now I feel like they're around every corner, so murders. All right.

38
00:02:27.741 --> 00:02:30.980
The next question is the Labatt blue light featured question.

39
00:02:31.130 --> 00:02:33.650
<v 1>The episode, uh, if you've made it this far,</v>

40
00:02:33.770 --> 00:02:36.290
we probably don't need my instruction, but that would be.

41
00:02:37.430 --> 00:02:41.390
<v 0>If you had to eat one human body part, what would it be?</v>

42
00:02:41.840 --> 00:02:44.930
Put whatever sauce you want on it. Put a, yeah, like a nice,

43
00:02:46.400 --> 00:02:50.210
I think, you know, you want to eat a butt cheek.

44
00:02:50.780 --> 00:02:53.450
I feel like that's the closest thing to like a,

45
00:02:53.780 --> 00:02:58.220
like a fatty sort of chicken breasts, the shape of it. I could get, I could,

46
00:02:58.310 --> 00:02:59.830
I could jump that in my head.

47
00:02:59.831 --> 00:03:02.320
If I'm looking at a foot or from looking at a hand,

48
00:03:02.321 --> 00:03:06.910
it's like the fish that they serve you, and it's still just a fish. I can't,

49
00:03:06.940 --> 00:03:09.460
I can't, uh, I can't do that. I can't do that.

50
00:03:09.461 --> 00:03:13.630
Or the pig on a roast on the spit roast and stuff. It's too real for me.

51
00:03:13.631 --> 00:03:15.460
It's too real for me. But, uh, I can,

52
00:03:15.760 --> 00:03:20.290
I can separate myself from a butt cheek and I actually think a human buttcheek

53
00:03:20.320 --> 00:03:22.870
probably, you know, prepared correctly.

54
00:03:24.550 --> 00:03:24.790
<v 1>Not.</v>

55
00:03:24.790 --> 00:03:27.790
<v 0>Bad. If you were taken hostage five years ago,</v>

56
00:03:28.180 --> 00:03:32.350
what would surprise you most about the world today? Five years ago,

57
00:03:32.351 --> 00:03:36.760
that puts us in 2015, uh,

58
00:03:36.910 --> 00:03:41.380
before you had, uh, w the idea that, uh,

59
00:03:41.440 --> 00:03:42.340
Uber Lyft,

60
00:03:42.341 --> 00:03:46.990
that just some random person is rolling up and they've been deputized

61
00:03:47.200 --> 00:03:51.340
through an app to be a taxi driver. What the hell here in New York,

62
00:03:51.341 --> 00:03:54.250
I talked to these taxi drivers all the time and say to get the medallion,

63
00:03:54.280 --> 00:03:57.490
they had to hand over like a decades worth of paperwork,

64
00:03:57.491 --> 00:04:01.960
and it cost them $80,000. And they got two, three guys split in this cab up,

65
00:04:01.961 --> 00:04:05.740
and it's like such a difficult, hard business. And then Lyft, Uber,

66
00:04:05.741 --> 00:04:10.630
just like a random college student getting some hours like any at the

67
00:04:10.631 --> 00:04:14.020
car. It's ridiculous. Yeah. Now I don't even think they like emission test.

68
00:04:14.021 --> 00:04:17.080
These cars is cat hair all over the back seat. It's ridiculous.

69
00:04:17.710 --> 00:04:20.050
You have a choice between a sum of money and world peace.

70
00:04:20.051 --> 00:04:23.920
How much money would it take for you to give up the world? Peace.

71
00:04:24.190 --> 00:04:28.780
Here's good guy, Sean, coming to the cause. Here's the way I look at it. Like,

72
00:04:28.810 --> 00:04:33.140
honestly, the way I grew up, even, you know,

73
00:04:33.190 --> 00:04:36.010
experienced some success lately in my, you know,

74
00:04:36.011 --> 00:04:40.150
your eyes widened to certain things and possibilities and things that you never

75
00:04:40.151 --> 00:04:44.500
thought possible. Maybe they are vastly. I can't spend a hundred million.

76
00:04:44.710 --> 00:04:46.510
You can give me a hundred million dollars. I can't,

77
00:04:46.630 --> 00:04:47.740
I don't think I can spend it.

78
00:04:47.741 --> 00:04:49.900
I don't think I'd feel good about spending more than that.

79
00:04:49.940 --> 00:04:54.130
I'd I'd have issues with that. So if you dropped off a hundred million dollars,

80
00:04:54.220 --> 00:04:57.070
that's the most I could ever spend in my life. So the question is,

81
00:04:57.250 --> 00:05:00.010
would I take $100 million or would I take world peace?

82
00:05:00.070 --> 00:05:02.110
And let me tell you something, I'd take world peace.

83
00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:03.833
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

84
00:05:06.030 --> 00:05:08.340
Way more than a hundred minute piece. You know,

85
00:05:08.341 --> 00:05:10.200
how much know much world pieces worth.

86
00:05:11.910 --> 00:05:15.510
<v 0>What movie most recently made you cry?</v>

87
00:05:15.960 --> 00:05:19.920
It was not that long ago. I saw, um,

88
00:05:20.730 --> 00:05:21.960
Florida project.

89
00:05:22.320 --> 00:05:26.970
I don't know if you've seen Florida project and cover your ears spoilers. Uh,

90
00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:31.110
but when she knocks at the door at the end and her friend opens it up and she

91
00:05:31.111 --> 00:05:34.650
has the tears and they hold each other's hands and they go to Disneyland

92
00:05:34.651 --> 00:05:38.820
together, Disney world together wa it was crazy.

93
00:05:39.080 --> 00:05:43.770
And I is my, you know, I'm just, I've got it down. Both eyes dripping,

94
00:05:43.800 --> 00:05:47.490
falling off of my chin. And it had been so long since I cried.

95
00:05:47.491 --> 00:05:48.960
I didn't even know if I could anymore.

96
00:05:50.430 --> 00:05:51.090
<v 1>And then Florida.</v>

97
00:05:51.090 --> 00:05:54.600
<v 0>Project last movie that made me cry. Hey, I needed something.</v>

98
00:05:55.980 --> 00:05:58.860
<v 2>Hey, if you haven't already got it. Get yourself a copy of answer the internet,</v>
