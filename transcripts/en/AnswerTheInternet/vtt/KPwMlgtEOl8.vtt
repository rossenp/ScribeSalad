00:00:00.210 --> 00:00:02.190
<v 0>I'm Dan Soder and this is me answering the internet.</v>

2
00:00:08.630 --> 00:00:11.570
<v 1>Would you rather know when you're going to die or how are you going to die,</v>

3
00:00:11.870 --> 00:00:14.060
dude? I'm a hypochondriac. How I'm going to die? I don't care what?

4
00:00:14.090 --> 00:00:18.950
Just tell me what it is so I can smoke cigarettes and get back

5
00:00:18.951 --> 00:00:23.330
to it. I miss smoking so bad. That's how good tobacco is to like,

6
00:00:23.331 --> 00:00:24.710
you want to know when you're in it. I'm like, I don't care.

7
00:00:24.711 --> 00:00:28.550
Can I smoke smoke right now? Cause I seriously did the opposite way.

8
00:00:28.580 --> 00:00:30.020
I would say if, when I'm going to die,

9
00:00:30.050 --> 00:00:34.550
if I get a diet 80 I'll smoke and then I don't care. Go fast in a car.

10
00:00:34.580 --> 00:00:37.370
No car crash. I'm going 90. Everywhere.

11
00:00:37.760 --> 00:00:41.990
I'm laying on the gas. You gotta look at it. You gotta, you gotta,

12
00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:46.340
you gotta jump the route on this. You gotta be like, Oh. I didn't die.

13
00:00:46.550 --> 00:00:49.010
Smoking butts. Next question.

14
00:00:49.970 --> 00:00:51.950
Would you rather be blind or dickless.

15
00:00:52.610 --> 00:00:55.070
<v 0>What? Why is tough?</v>

16
00:00:55.280 --> 00:00:56.120
<v 1>Yeah, sure.</v>

17
00:00:56.121 --> 00:01:00.920
So it was being dickless you just got to walk around to just be weird things

18
00:01:00.921 --> 00:01:03.380
like, Oh, wind would hit and you'd be like, ah, you should have to be,

19
00:01:03.381 --> 00:01:06.920
feel that I'm a Dick and my jeans it'd be stuff that you would never realize you

20
00:01:06.921 --> 00:01:11.390
would miss your Dick for coming out of a pool, being blind.

21
00:01:11.391 --> 00:01:12.620
You don't feel around.

22
00:01:13.010 --> 00:01:17.780
I hope I have a way better shot to finding the woman of my dreams feeling faces.

23
00:01:17.781 --> 00:01:21.740
How great is it to walk in a room to start grabbing faces, Palm and people?

24
00:01:22.040 --> 00:01:25.160
What he is? Who are you? All right. I'm bad at remembering names.

25
00:01:25.190 --> 00:01:29.840
So I'd be like, Oh, is that? And that is Steve. His second motion, his eyebrows.

26
00:01:30.230 --> 00:01:31.550
What kind of it.

27
00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:36.110
Would you rather have sex with a girl who has banged a thousand dudes or one

28
00:01:36.111 --> 00:01:36.944
animal?

29
00:01:37.850 --> 00:01:42.590
How afraid or what dude? I would,

30
00:01:42.680 --> 00:01:45.770
I'll take a thousand chickens bend a thousand dudes every time.

31
00:01:46.070 --> 00:01:49.400
Cause first off that means, that mean beach. That is like,

32
00:01:49.430 --> 00:01:50.990
that's like Conan on the wheel.

33
00:01:51.080 --> 00:01:55.160
She's pushed the wheel enough times or like she knows what she's doing or what

34
00:01:55.190 --> 00:01:56.630
are you going to be like now let me a sheep.

35
00:01:57.500 --> 00:02:00.740
You have to be so insecure to be like, I'd rather a barnyard animal.

36
00:02:01.790 --> 00:02:04.550
Cause I don't want to follow a guy that might've been good at sex.

37
00:02:06.140 --> 00:02:09.590
Just give me that goat. Come here. I can't a chick.

38
00:02:09.770 --> 00:02:13.250
That's bang a thousand dudes. I wouldn't give a. I'd be like, all right,

39
00:02:13.251 --> 00:02:17.210
I'll give her three stripes. Like a general. I'd be like, this is my lady.

40
00:02:17.211 --> 00:02:19.190
She has been to war.

41
00:02:19.880 --> 00:02:23.720
Would you rather be hooking up with a girl and prematurely come in your pants

42
00:02:24.320 --> 00:02:28.340
and she finds out or start crying in the middle of the sex.

43
00:02:29.360 --> 00:02:31.700
I feel like you can rebound easier from crying during sex.

44
00:02:32.510 --> 00:02:35.300
I feel like I would rather cry during sex because I could be like, it's just,

45
00:02:35.540 --> 00:02:39.980
we're in the moment. And I love this so much. It's supposed to be like,

46
00:02:40.310 --> 00:02:42.470
don't touch me. Don't touch me. And then she's like, what happened? You're like,

47
00:02:42.500 --> 00:02:44.630
Oh. Oh. I'd be.

48
00:02:44.630 --> 00:02:46.940
<v 0>Like a little more normal than.</v>

49
00:02:47.210 --> 00:02:51.440
<v 1>Crying. You think you busting your pants, you busting your pants game over.</v>

50
00:02:51.890 --> 00:02:56.810
You're not moving on. You cry during sex. She might be like,

51
00:02:56.840 --> 00:03:01.480
this guy loves me. Yeah, there you go. I'd rather cry during sex.

52
00:03:01.990 --> 00:03:05.290
Would you rather be bald by the age of 20 or five?

53
00:03:05.500 --> 00:03:10.330
Three with a full head of hair. Short guys getting no love.

54
00:03:11.080 --> 00:03:15.940
give me seven feet bald as a. You can have sex with anyone you want,

55
00:03:16.150 --> 00:03:21.100
but they die immediately after who or O or just

56
00:03:21.101 --> 00:03:22.030
who do you have sex with?

57
00:03:26.100 --> 00:03:26.250
<v 0>Awesome.</v>

58
00:03:26.250 --> 00:03:31.050
<v 1>I got one for you. A Casey Anthony.</v>

59
00:03:31.440 --> 00:03:34.740
<v 0>Oh, that's a great answer.</v>

60
00:03:35.310 --> 00:03:39.330
<v 1>Call me, call me Dick justice. That's for Kaylee.</v>

61
00:03:42.670 --> 00:03:45.690
What a weird thing to say after you come and kill ya. That one was,

62
00:03:49.110 --> 00:03:51.000
I don't think that was wrong. I think I'm right.

63
00:03:51.060 --> 00:03:54.120
Other than everyone agrees with me. You don't have the balls to push it.

64
00:03:55.380 --> 00:03:58.940
I'm coming for that wrong.

65
00:04:00.510 --> 00:04:01.350
you. That little girl.

66
00:04:05.130 --> 00:04:08.970
Would you rather have a girl who talks too much during sex or is completely

67
00:04:08.971 --> 00:04:12.420
silent? Do that talk too much complete.

68
00:04:12.450 --> 00:04:16.830
Have you completely signed thing? I've gone through it. It is not good.

69
00:04:16.831 --> 00:04:18.030
Heavy nostril breathing

70
00:04:19.680 --> 00:04:23.190
feels like you're it feels like having sex with a quadriplegic. It's hard.

71
00:04:25.740 --> 00:04:27.870
It sounds like you're just wasting their time. Like,

72
00:04:30.960 --> 00:04:35.490
Am I putting you through a a workout? Is this a, is this a spin class?

73
00:04:38.230 --> 00:04:41.280
I can't do that too much. I'm afraid a book is going to shoot right out. Yeah.

74
00:04:41.310 --> 00:04:42.330
Talks way too much.

75
00:04:42.810 --> 00:04:45.960
Would you rather wake up to a every morning or a hundred dollars under your

76
00:04:45.961 --> 00:04:50.640
pillow? Every morning. I'm going to say a hundred bucks. Really?

77
00:04:50.820 --> 00:04:52.440
Have you ever gotten a beach when you're,

78
00:04:52.500 --> 00:04:55.890
when you're not really into it and it's the morning and you feel weird.

79
00:04:55.891 --> 00:04:59.850
It's like, it's like turning down a great dinner. You feel bad. You're like,

80
00:04:59.851 --> 00:05:02.190
I understand this is great, but I'm in a weird, I got a fart.

81
00:05:02.220 --> 00:05:04.620
Maybe I got a poop. Sometimes I gotta poop for thing in the morning.

82
00:05:05.130 --> 00:05:08.310
I'm not taking the beach right then and there. That's just disrespectful to her.

83
00:05:09.450 --> 00:05:13.110
Just waking up to a crisp $100. Let's go out for breakfast.

84
00:05:13.830 --> 00:05:15.810
Get that beach around 2:00 PM.

85
00:05:17.400 --> 00:05:22.260
Would you rather get your girlfriend pregnant when you're 16 or get

86
00:05:22.261 --> 00:05:25.860
your wife pregnant when you're 60? What a dumb question?

87
00:05:26.160 --> 00:05:29.130
60 all day. Maybe I'm around. Maybe.

88
00:05:29.130 --> 00:05:29.963
<v 0>I'm not.</v>

89
00:05:32.220 --> 00:05:34.590
<v 1>I'm out of here. 60. My dad clocked out at 48.</v>

90
00:05:35.640 --> 00:05:40.500
Would you rather sit on a cake and eat a Dick or sit on a

91
00:05:40.501 --> 00:05:44.760
Dick and eat a cake? Best question of the day was really hurts.

92
00:05:45.720 --> 00:05:46.770
I mean, it's going to hurt you through it.

93
00:05:52.980 --> 00:05:54.600
I'm going to sit on a cake and eat a Dick.

94
00:05:54.750 --> 00:05:57.180
Cause I just feel like I can just pretend the Dick something else.

95
00:05:57.410 --> 00:06:00.350
Eating cake with a Dick in my butt will ruin cake forever.

96
00:06:01.730 --> 00:06:04.910
Does that make any sense? I don't know something, you know,

97
00:06:05.060 --> 00:06:08.960
just like an Otter pop, like a, like a flushed flavored Otter pop.

98
00:06:11.210 --> 00:06:13.730
But you just sit in there with a Dick in your and then someone you're at your

99
00:06:13.731 --> 00:06:17.510
grandma's birthday and she's like try some cake and you're like, I can't,

100
00:06:17.810 --> 00:06:21.200
I got bouffed out to it. I'm not ruining cake.

101
00:06:22.100 --> 00:06:23.750
Would you rather stub your toe,

102
00:06:24.350 --> 00:06:28.250
get a brain freeze or bite your char your tongue cheek randomly three times a

103
00:06:28.251 --> 00:06:31.430
day. Uh, stub my toe.

104
00:06:32.270 --> 00:06:35.480
Cause I feel like you're going to shake that off stump toes.

105
00:06:35.490 --> 00:06:38.930
It hurts a little bit at first, a little bit at second. And then it goes away.

106
00:06:39.130 --> 00:06:42.460
<v 0>This is literally a couple of seconds. Total real heart.</v>

107
00:06:42.790 --> 00:06:44.350
That rush where it goes off your toes,

108
00:06:44.351 --> 00:06:47.470
your brain crazy versus biting your cheek and your tone.

109
00:06:49.120 --> 00:06:52.780
<v 1>Because then it's talking, eating everything's affected brain freeze.</v>

110
00:06:52.781 --> 00:06:55.990
I did learn the trick of flipping your tone. You push the top,

111
00:06:56.050 --> 00:06:59.770
but that's some that works most of the time. I do stubbed toe all day.

112
00:07:00.280 --> 00:07:03.520
<v 0>Like, uh, like in the wind knocked down Hill. It really doesn't happen.</v>

113
00:07:03.521 --> 00:07:04.354
Once you become an adult.

114
00:07:05.060 --> 00:07:07.810
<v 1>Do I get brain freeze all the time? I also, yeah, I also eat ice cream.</v>

115
00:07:07.811 --> 00:07:08.920
Like I'm 10.

116
00:07:09.790 --> 00:07:12.130
<v 0>You eat ice cream fast enough. It doesn't matter how old you are.</v>

117
00:07:13.300 --> 00:07:13.301
<v 1>It.</v>

118
00:07:13.301 --> 00:07:17.350
Every Sunday I get very stoned when I get off the road and I eat a pint of 20

119
00:07:17.530 --> 00:07:19.810
and I'm pretty good for one brain freeze a Sunday.

120
00:07:20.470 --> 00:07:22.600
There's one brain freeze where you just see me walking around my apartment

121
00:07:22.601 --> 00:07:23.434
going.

122
00:07:26.560 --> 00:07:28.750
Mediterranean mint. Not you too.

123
00:07:29.260 --> 00:07:33.010
Would you rather be twice your age or half your height? Twice my age.

124
00:07:33.820 --> 00:07:38.680
I'm not gonna be three feet seven. I don't know. Do I want to be three feet?

125
00:07:39.790 --> 00:07:42.910
I'm six. Three. So that would make me three.

126
00:07:45.130 --> 00:07:49.570
Who's good at math. Come on, huh? Because this is a three, one and a half.

127
00:07:49.840 --> 00:07:53.860
I'd be what? Come on, man. I'll be 70 all day,

128
00:07:54.190 --> 00:07:58.180
because guess what my rule is. If I hit 70, I'm smoking cigs again, next one,

129
00:07:59.530 --> 00:08:00.700
camel lights. I miss you.

130
00:08:01.510 --> 00:08:05.650
Would you rather have a good hand job from your grandmother or a bad hand job

131
00:08:05.770 --> 00:08:08.650
from your grandmother? Did my is from Oklahoma there.

132
00:08:08.651 --> 00:08:12.850
Ain't no way she's tossing out mediocre hedges. I say, I,

133
00:08:13.240 --> 00:08:16.540
you get in and get a good hand job. And you're like, Oh grandpa.

134
00:08:16.750 --> 00:08:21.730
You're a lucky man. You pop. And like, can I get a reason?

135
00:08:23.680 --> 00:08:28.060
So many good snacks after you come get those strawberries in their package?

136
00:08:29.380 --> 00:08:32.620
What STD would I be willing to get to pass on to someone? I mean,

137
00:08:32.621 --> 00:08:35.740
isn't that everyone's answers HPV. Cause that's the real thing

138
00:08:37.240 --> 00:08:41.260
is do we act like the nineties and two thousands didn't happen? Uh,

139
00:08:41.290 --> 00:08:46.270
I would probably say gonorrhea. Yeah. You know a little drip. You get angry,

140
00:08:46.330 --> 00:08:50.710
take a pill. You're good. Who would I, Oh,

141
00:08:50.711 --> 00:08:54.130
I'd go head hunting. I'd go back for some old broken hearts for that.

142
00:08:55.850 --> 00:08:56.070
No, you want.

143
00:08:56.070 --> 00:08:59.250
<v 0>To go get something to hang out. I up.</v>

144
00:09:00.560 --> 00:09:04.190
<v 1>Starting today. If you get $10,000 a day for every day, you don't.</v>

145
00:09:05.150 --> 00:09:07.100
How many days could you go without jerking off.

146
00:09:09.590 --> 00:09:13.670
<v 0>10 K a day. Stop the tape gravy train.</v>

147
00:09:14.120 --> 00:09:15.770
<v 1>And I think I could get.</v>

148
00:09:16.970 --> 00:09:17.840
<v 0>One month.</v>

149
00:09:20.660 --> 00:09:24.530
<v 1>For 10 K a day. If I knew it was 10 K day, literally physically.</v>

150
00:09:24.650 --> 00:09:26.110
I don't think actually you're right.

151
00:09:26.240 --> 00:09:28.160
Cause I remember I don't jerk off when I go to my grandma's.

152
00:09:28.161 --> 00:09:32.120
That's why the hand job question was so hard and uh,

153
00:09:32.150 --> 00:09:33.470
I made it like five days,

154
00:09:33.471 --> 00:09:38.430
one time and I was about to just start punching the wall because that 30 days.

155
00:09:38.870 --> 00:09:42.860
<v 0>All right. Hey, wildly overestimate your wild little recipe, 15 days.</v>

156
00:09:44.260 --> 00:09:46.730
<v 1>And that's tough, but I feel like I can do it 150 K</v>

157
00:09:48.980 --> 00:09:51.800
15 days. I feel like I can. Now here's the question.

158
00:09:52.010 --> 00:09:56.360
Can I just unload before the 15 days dry out?

159
00:09:56.870 --> 00:10:01.550
Twist the sponge? No, just completely dry bone, dry walking in.

160
00:10:01.580 --> 00:10:04.580
I got 15 days. I think by day 14,

161
00:10:04.820 --> 00:10:08.300
I have to be in a cage by myself. Yeah.

162
00:10:08.301 --> 00:10:10.600
I'm just like a tiger walking back into it.

163
00:10:11.600 --> 00:10:15.500
Better not be windy or nice weather because if it's hot, I'll break,

164
00:10:15.710 --> 00:10:16.820
it's got to be cold.

165
00:10:17.150 --> 00:10:18.200
<v 0>Cold.</v>

166
00:10:18.890 --> 00:10:21.170
<v 1>Can I do mushrooms a lot? So I don't want to touch my Dick.</v>

167
00:10:22.670 --> 00:10:25.010
Have you ever done mushrooms? Oh, you do not.

168
00:10:25.730 --> 00:10:28.490
Your penis feels very silly in your hands. When you do mushrooms,

169
00:10:29.930 --> 00:10:32.540
I've never touched my Dick on mushrooms and be like, yeah, I'm always like.

170
00:10:32.900 --> 00:10:36.470
<v 0>What is this? This is the source of all these problems.</v>

171
00:10:37.790 --> 00:10:41.000
This little thing. This number trunk.
