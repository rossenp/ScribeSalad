00:00:00.360 --> 00:00:01.111
<v 0>Hey, what's up. You guys,</v>

2
00:00:01.111 --> 00:00:04.290
I'm Gabriel Iglesias and I'm about to answer the internet.

3
00:00:04.380 --> 00:00:09.300
So my show is called mystery glass. Yes. It comes out on Netflix, uh, June 21st,

4
00:00:09.301 --> 00:00:14.220
if this is after June 21st, it is streaming now. So check it out and, uh, yeah,

5
00:00:14.250 --> 00:00:15.083
let's see what happens.

6
00:00:22.040 --> 00:00:22.460
<v 1>[Inaudible].</v>

7
00:00:22.460 --> 00:00:27.440
<v 0>Would you rather know when you're going to die or how you're going</v>

8
00:00:27.441 --> 00:00:30.380
to die? I'd rather know how I'm going to die,

9
00:00:30.950 --> 00:00:32.480
because that will determine my diet.

10
00:00:32.900 --> 00:00:37.070
Would you rather be stuck in Jumanji or Jurassic park?

11
00:00:38.240 --> 00:00:38.811
Uh, you know what?

12
00:00:38.811 --> 00:00:42.770
I think that there's more things that could kill you in Jumanji than in Jurassic

13
00:00:42.771 --> 00:00:45.800
park. The most random things can get you in Jumanji. So I'm, uh,

14
00:00:45.810 --> 00:00:49.280
I'm going to go with trying to outrun a dinosaur. Uh,

15
00:00:49.281 --> 00:00:53.900
you're in a car chase, let's say you're in a car chase with the police.

16
00:00:54.230 --> 00:00:59.000
What song is playing in your car? Uh, something by [inaudible],

17
00:00:59.001 --> 00:01:03.440
which is a Mexican band. Uh, basically it's like gangster rap in Spanish,

18
00:01:03.830 --> 00:01:05.480
kind of cause that's the type of songs they sing.

19
00:01:05.720 --> 00:01:07.370
And if you're trying to outrun the cops,

20
00:01:07.580 --> 00:01:10.250
it'd be kind of cool to be hearing some of these songs in Spanish while you're

21
00:01:10.490 --> 00:01:14.540
like, you can have one thing free for the rest of your life.

22
00:01:15.350 --> 00:01:20.150
<v 1>What would you choose Starbucks? Yeah, I'm one of those.</v>

23
00:01:21.440 --> 00:01:23.180
<v 0>All right. If you were stuck inside of a,</v>

24
00:01:24.050 --> 00:01:28.580
if you were stuck inside of a food that you had to eat your way out of

25
00:01:29.030 --> 00:01:30.290
what would you choose.

26
00:01:31.460 --> 00:01:34.610
<v 1>A donut all day.</v>

27
00:01:35.020 --> 00:01:38.590
<v 0>And you get offered a billion dollars to never leave the state.</v>

28
00:01:39.410 --> 00:01:43.760
<v 1>Of Ohio. Do you take it? Ooh.</v>

29
00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:48.260
<v 0>Billion dollars as it is. You can buy a lot with five. Um,</v>

30
00:01:48.290 --> 00:01:51.290
you probably own the whole state of Ohio for a billion dollars.

31
00:01:52.820 --> 00:01:57.450
I'd take it. I've been there. They've got a Bob Bevins and they also got a, uh,

32
00:01:57.560 --> 00:02:00.260
you know, I, I could, I could, for a billion dollars,

33
00:02:00.440 --> 00:02:04.400
I could bring my favorite restaurants and open them in Ohio.

34
00:02:04.970 --> 00:02:07.220
Like they don't have that. They will, when I'm done with them.

35
00:02:07.910 --> 00:02:11.540
And for that much money, I can buy my own neighbors. Uh, I think I'd be happy.

36
00:02:11.900 --> 00:02:16.010
I'd be cool. Billion bucks. You can do a lot. I, you know, I don't go there now.

37
00:02:16.880 --> 00:02:20.240
I don't go there. Now. You're going to miss the beaches. I'll buy paintings.

38
00:02:21.020 --> 00:02:25.220
Would you rather date a girl who laughs at everything or nothing?

39
00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:27.830
I'd say everything because I've,

40
00:02:27.890 --> 00:02:30.320
I've dated the other one and it didn't work out.

41
00:02:32.060 --> 00:02:34.880
You get to marry the girl of your dreams,

42
00:02:34.970 --> 00:02:39.740
but you have to watch your biggest enemy have sex with

43
00:02:39.741 --> 00:02:43.130
her first. Do you do it?

44
00:02:45.290 --> 00:02:45.950
<v 1>Wow.</v>

45
00:02:45.950 --> 00:02:47.600
<v 0>You guys are up.</v>

46
00:02:52.010 --> 00:02:52.130
<v 1>[Inaudible].</v>

47
00:02:52.130 --> 00:02:54.950
<v 0>I don't think I could get that mentally out of my head. That'd be,</v>

48
00:02:55.160 --> 00:02:59.830
that'd be weird. Uh, yeah, no. Cause he could always say like, you know,

49
00:02:59.831 --> 00:03:03.090
if he's my biggest enemy, he could always look at me and be like full.

50
00:03:03.091 --> 00:03:03.970
I had her first.

51
00:03:04.150 --> 00:03:08.380
Would you rather have a Dick as your

52
00:03:08.381 --> 00:03:13.270
nose or a nose as your Dick?

53
00:03:18.510 --> 00:03:18.810
<v 1>You'd.</v>

54
00:03:18.810 --> 00:03:20.490
<v 0>Like me to answer this I'm sure.</v>

55
00:03:21.090 --> 00:03:23.700
<v 1>I guess if I had to choose,</v>

56
00:03:26.850 --> 00:03:27.660
I'm going to go with it.

57
00:03:27.660 --> 00:03:32.640
<v 0>Dick, uh, knows Dick. I'm going to go, go with a nose Dick.</v>

58
00:03:32.970 --> 00:03:35.100
Just, you know, so I can have a normal life.

59
00:03:37.110 --> 00:03:38.940
<v 1>Somewhat. Yeah.</v>

60
00:03:39.040 --> 00:03:41.100
<v 0>But yeah, I'll walk it around now. Yeah.</v>

61
00:03:44.700 --> 00:03:46.560
<v 1>What's on your pads. I got a cold.</v>

62
00:03:47.790 --> 00:03:52.380
<v 0>Uh, would you rather prove aliens are real or prove</v>

63
00:03:52.381 --> 00:03:57.330
ghosts are real well, I have my own conspiracies, uh,

64
00:03:57.450 --> 00:04:00.720
but uh, I I'd rather prove that ghosts are real.

65
00:04:01.470 --> 00:04:02.570
<v 1>Go on with the conspiracy</v>

66
00:04:07.150 --> 00:04:11.760
[inaudible] Oh, here we go. Ah, I don't think.

67
00:04:11.880 --> 00:04:15.540
<v 0>Alone in this universe. I, I don't. I think it's it's it's you know,</v>

68
00:04:15.780 --> 00:04:19.800
for us to think we're the only ones that happen to be around that's no, man,

69
00:04:20.220 --> 00:04:23.880
you know, even Ohio has, has people that well, nevermind.

70
00:04:26.310 --> 00:04:28.680
<v 1>We're not alone people. We're not alone.</v>
