Or a bad hand job from your grandma. Your mother.

10
00:00:44.840 --> 00:00:46.760
That's a bad one.

11
00:00:49.790 --> 00:00:53.090
You don't want a good cause you want to be thinking about it the next week.

12
00:00:53.270 --> 00:00:57.350
You want to be like, Oh, that was terrible. Old Brinkley hands.

13
00:00:57.770 --> 00:01:00.830
What would be the one song you want played at your funeral? Yo,

14
00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:09.350
I got a new. Yeah, everybody better do the dance while I'm in my cast.

15
00:01:12.650 --> 00:01:16.490
The one celebrity birthday party you would want to attend.

16
00:01:17.720 --> 00:01:22.430
Um, you choose bono cause I'm not really a fan. So I'd just walk out.

17
00:01:22.490 --> 00:01:24.380
I just leave. I'd be like Bano I'm out.

18
00:01:24.410 --> 00:01:29.360
Thanks and have sex with anyone you want or transport anywhere

19
00:01:29.361 --> 00:01:33.050
in the world. Yeah. Okay. Well then I guess, uh, I guess I,

20
00:01:33.051 --> 00:01:34.250
I guess I'd want to just, yeah.

21
00:01:34.270 --> 00:01:38.240
Snap the fingers and transport go wherever the I want, I don't want to have sec.

22
00:01:38.241 --> 00:01:40.490
What am I going to get chlamydia again? Uh,

23
00:01:40.491 --> 00:01:45.350
would you rather have a threesome with two female literal people done it

24
00:01:45.530 --> 00:01:49.340
or three? So with the seven foot tall,

25
00:01:49.760 --> 00:01:51.650
I'll never had seven foot tall chick.

26
00:01:51.651 --> 00:01:53.600
So I would go with that one because I did the little bit,

27
00:01:55.430 --> 00:01:57.440
sorry I'm have done it.

28
00:01:57.860 --> 00:02:00.770
You have to do it internationally.

29
00:02:02.600 --> 00:02:06.290
International it's internet. You got it's international. Isn't Dubai.

30
00:02:08.690 --> 00:02:10.880
How did this come about? It was one night.

31
00:02:10.910 --> 00:02:15.860
They were rushing in Dubai crazy story, but they were like, yeah,

32
00:02:15.890 --> 00:02:18.740
man, it was a good night, but that was also the night. I was like,

33
00:02:18.770 --> 00:02:20.270
I think I've gone too far.

34
00:02:24.260 --> 00:02:25.120
They got me through.

35
00:02:25.130 --> 00:02:29.390
But do you want to sit down with your parents and watch every sexual encounter

36
00:02:29.391 --> 00:02:33.980
you've had or watch your parents' sex tape when they

37
00:02:33.981 --> 00:02:34.910
conceived?

38
00:02:34.911 --> 00:02:39.860
You ha I'd rather sit down and watch my own sexual thing because I've already

39
00:02:39.861 --> 00:02:43.760
seen Polaroids of when they conceived me. Get outta here. Yeah. Why?

40
00:02:44.120 --> 00:02:48.940
My father took pictures. My mother had a good. Show them to you.

41
00:02:49.550 --> 00:02:51.410
Check it out. Yeah, exactly.

42
00:02:51.411 --> 00:02:53.750
It was like looking through the Hubble telescope and seeing the beginning of

43
00:02:53.751 --> 00:02:58.310
time. But was my dad my mom from the back. Would you rather yourself?

44
00:02:58.340 --> 00:03:02.920
Every time you have orgasm or get a random every time you talk to a dude,

45
00:03:03.340 --> 00:03:05.950
I, I would rather myself. Every time I had an orgasm,

46
00:03:05.980 --> 00:03:09.550
I already do do myself every time. Yeah.

47
00:03:09.820 --> 00:03:13.630
But that's a double orgasm because taking a is fantastic. It's orgasmic. Yeah.

48
00:03:13.660 --> 00:03:16.510
Right. You just be like, I mean, that's the ultimate pleasure.

49
00:03:16.511 --> 00:03:19.390
Orgasm is at the same time. Right down to it. This is a super easy question.

50
00:03:19.480 --> 00:03:20.770
Yeah. I'd definitely rather.

51
00:03:22.330 --> 00:03:24.760
That's what's stupid about the question is how easy it is.

52
00:03:25.990 --> 00:03:28.810
If you could only watch one category of porn for the rest of your life,

53
00:03:29.040 --> 00:03:33.790
would it be a boy? Um,

54
00:03:35.320 --> 00:03:37.750
it's a toss up between barely legal and

55
00:03:40.840 --> 00:03:43.600
because I just want new people coming into the pipeline. You know what I mean?

56
00:03:43.601 --> 00:03:44.620
And those are the two.

57
00:03:44.621 --> 00:03:47.680
So depending on where my issues lay probably barely legal.

58
00:03:47.690 --> 00:03:51.970
I have to say it barely though. It's barely remember that word is barely.

59
00:03:52.440 --> 00:03:55.080
<v 1>You have a choice between a sum of money and world peace.</v>

60
00:03:55.110 --> 00:03:57.480
How much money would it take for you to give up world peace?

61
00:04:00.060 --> 00:04:01.230
I'm not giving up world peace.

62
00:04:04.320 --> 00:04:08.850
I have enough money. I'm fine. Or is it all my money taken away? Now I'm broke.

63
00:04:09.320 --> 00:04:13.320
<v 0>You have $0 world peace or a hundred billion dollars.</v>

64
00:04:13.800 --> 00:04:16.170
<v 1>I don't need a hundred billion dollars that causes a lot of problems.</v>

65
00:04:16.910 --> 00:04:18.780
<v 0>Well, world piece or 10, if you're broke.</v>

66
00:04:19.560 --> 00:04:23.160
<v 1>Well, if I'm broken, I have to like survive and I've got my kid. Yeah.</v>

67
00:04:24.480 --> 00:04:28.110
I don't know. Couple hundred thousand for a year.

68
00:04:29.970 --> 00:04:31.320
I mean, she's got to go to private school.

69
00:04:32.250 --> 00:04:35.550
<v 0>You are in an open field, armed with a baseball bat.</v>

70
00:04:37.770 --> 00:04:41.580
Picture that. Okay. How many ten-year-olds wearing bike helmets.

71
00:04:41.581 --> 00:04:43.410
Could you take down before they get you?

72
00:04:44.130 --> 00:04:47.070
So just a wave of ten-year-olds coming at you and game of Thrones. Oh,

73
00:04:47.080 --> 00:04:48.330
it wouldn't matter. I'd get them all.

74
00:04:49.980 --> 00:04:54.300
Absolutely infinite. I'd destroy those kids.

75
00:04:54.360 --> 00:04:58.710
10 years old. Oh, they're. Yeah.

76
00:04:58.750 --> 00:05:02.760
I'd be John Snow. I'd be jive. I'd be John Snow all over that.

77
00:05:03.660 --> 00:05:07.350
Just ten-year-old bodies all over the place. It was a little idiots.

78
00:05:07.500 --> 00:05:09.210
Think what are they going to do to me? Idiots.

79
00:05:09.630 --> 00:05:12.690
<v 2>You had to pick one person to be the ambassador for the human race to meet</v>

80
00:05:12.691 --> 00:05:17.310
aliens. Who would it be? Ooh, this is good. I probably pay,

81
00:05:20.820 --> 00:05:24.270
um, probably a Filipino dude. I'm really infatuated about the Latinos.

82
00:05:24.510 --> 00:05:26.520
They're happy. They're joyous. You know,

83
00:05:26.521 --> 00:05:30.480
they call them the smiling people somewhere on the internet. And um,

84
00:05:30.840 --> 00:05:32.850
and every Filipino I meet, they're real gracious.

85
00:05:32.851 --> 00:05:37.200
They do a lot of senior care centers, hospice. So you don't,

86
00:05:37.560 --> 00:05:39.930
who else are you going to send out there, dude? You know what I'm saying?

87
00:05:40.320 --> 00:05:44.640
A drunk, uh, you know, uh, somebody from Scotland know somebody on Coke.

88
00:05:45.120 --> 00:05:48.420
We can't do any of that. You got to send somebody who is caring. I think.

89
00:05:49.200 --> 00:05:50.370
<v 0>Can you just say like the rock</v>

90
00:05:56.590 --> 00:06:00.620
[inaudible] we're good on. Yeah. Yeah. Maybe Manny Pacquiao.

91
00:06:00.830 --> 00:06:05.480
Would you rather sit on a cake and eat a Dick or

92
00:06:05.540 --> 00:06:08.630
sit on a Dick if, either kick

93
00:06:15.530 --> 00:06:20.240
yo you know what? This is depends how big the Dick and cake are. Right?

94
00:06:20.241 --> 00:06:23.300
Like if it's a small Dick, like if it's,

95
00:06:24.440 --> 00:06:28.370
if it's like half a pinky, right? That's a thorough wipe.

96
00:06:28.670 --> 00:06:32.120
That's not even really sex. Do you know what I mean? Like,

97
00:06:32.270 --> 00:06:36.560
I'm going deeper in there to get Dingleberry. So if it's a small Dick,

98
00:06:36.860 --> 00:06:39.380
I'd rather sit on the Dick and then eat a cake.

99
00:06:39.381 --> 00:06:41.780
It doesn't matter the size of cake. Right? It's going to be slight discomfort.

100
00:06:41.781 --> 00:06:46.220
It's like carrying a shank into prison. It's not even gay.

101
00:06:46.221 --> 00:06:47.450
I'm just protecting myself

102
00:06:50.690 --> 00:06:52.700
without a doubt. I'm not eating a Dick. That's nuts.

103
00:06:55.460 --> 00:07:00.110
Calm, loudly. Every time you fart or fart loudly,

104
00:07:00.111 --> 00:07:05.090
every time you come, yo, if you came loudly, every time you fart,

105
00:07:05.300 --> 00:07:07.400
you would've came 19 times on the way over here.

106
00:07:10.370 --> 00:07:14.210
Quito part smells like you have no idea. I find a lot.

107
00:07:14.420 --> 00:07:18.020
No it lingers. I'm going to fart loudly. Every time I come.

108
00:07:26.230 --> 00:07:27.880
<v 1>Would you rather watch your, Oh,</v>

109
00:07:27.881 --> 00:07:31.300
watch your parents have sex every night or join in one

110
00:07:33.580 --> 00:07:38.470
night. Oh my God. Oh my God. I mean,

111
00:07:39.280 --> 00:07:44.110
I'd have to watch it because I'm not joining in my dad's way

112
00:07:44.111 --> 00:07:48.820
to Fly home. And I'm like,

113
00:07:48.821 --> 00:07:51.130
am I a mountain climber? Or am I having sex on my desk?

114
00:07:53.710 --> 00:07:56.350
I can't. When someone's two I'm five foot three he's six foot six.

115
00:07:56.351 --> 00:08:00.970
So how is logistics even gonna work? Come on guys. Wow. Drama.

116
00:08:01.030 --> 00:08:02.650
Just talk about you're your dad.

117
00:08:05.110 --> 00:08:06.850
I heard somebody over there. Go sheesh.

118
00:08:10.090 --> 00:08:10.630
<v 0>[Inaudible].</v>

119
00:08:10.630 --> 00:08:15.490
<v 3>Would you rather have a Dick as your nose or nose as your Dick? Definitely.</v>

120
00:08:15.790 --> 00:08:18.100
A nose is my Dick. Cause then you could blow my nose.

121
00:08:27.070 --> 00:08:27.280
<v 0>[Inaudible].</v>

122
00:08:27.280 --> 00:08:29.620
<v 3>No one upset you, but I'm not on antibiotics,</v>

123
00:08:31.600 --> 00:08:34.570
but it's viral. Take them anyway. Kids.

124
00:08:34.630 --> 00:08:39.100
If people tell you don't take antibiotics because it's not bacteria.

125
00:08:39.101 --> 00:08:43.840
They're full of. Take drugs no matter what and stay in school,

126
00:08:43.930 --> 00:08:46.360
which fictional character would you love to be the.

127
00:08:47.260 --> 00:08:48.820
<v 0>I mean, you're not real, right? I mean,</v>

128
00:08:50.190 --> 00:08:53.230
you're not everyone here at the office calls you nothing but a phony.

129
00:08:53.530 --> 00:08:55.950
So I think it, you,

130
00:09:06.420 --> 00:09:10.830
Hey, I'm sorry. I'm sorry. Can we go back? Hey, I'm sorry. No,

131
00:09:10.840 --> 00:09:15.450
that wasn't called for. I said I was sorry. I'm sorry. I'll change.

132
00:09:15.810 --> 00:09:16.643
I'm sorry.

133
00:09:23.490 --> 00:09:24.323
Okay.

134
00:09:30.300 --> 00:09:34.620
Okay. Your mom and girlfriend switched bodies, huh?

135
00:09:35.130 --> 00:09:38.730
Only way to get them back to normal is to bang. One of them.

136
00:09:39.120 --> 00:09:40.680
Who do you have sex with?

137
00:09:46.050 --> 00:09:49.530
I said I was sorry. I said I was, I mean,

138
00:09:51.210 --> 00:09:54.960
I feel, if I say girlfriend I'll somehow offend my mom. I don't know why.

139
00:09:59.180 --> 00:10:03.440
<v 1>Throw Adam Schefter over a field goalpost. Yes.</v>

140
00:10:03.680 --> 00:10:07.910
I've literally seen Rob pick up both of my sisters on his arms and just like

141
00:10:07.940 --> 00:10:10.730
while they hang like monkeys. So if, if Adam's a little guy,

142
00:10:10.731 --> 00:10:14.060
he could definitely pick them up and throw him easy. Rob benches me.

143
00:10:14.270 --> 00:10:15.103
There's no problem.

144
00:10:15.740 --> 00:10:20.720
If you're a Dick was represented by an NFL player,

145
00:10:20.721 --> 00:10:24.350
who would it be? It would be Rashad. Jenna.

146
00:10:28.040 --> 00:10:31.250
<v 0>You'd rather sit down with your parents and watch every sexual encounter you've</v>

147
00:10:31.251 --> 00:10:35.270
had or watch your parents' sex tape when they've conceived you the sex tape when

148
00:10:35.271 --> 00:10:38.180
they conceived me. Why? Because it's the greatest moment that ever happened.

149
00:10:39.920 --> 00:10:44.720
<v 1>Would you rather date an ugly rich dude or a poor good looking guy? Very rich,</v>

150
00:10:44.721 --> 00:10:48.740
very ugly, very poor, very hot, rich and ugly. Well,

151
00:10:48.770 --> 00:10:53.690
Joey did actually get with a rich guy for free shoes

152
00:10:53.691 --> 00:10:54.170
for free. Sure.

153
00:10:54.170 --> 00:10:56.780
They were really expensive shoes and I just got an all fours and um,

154
00:10:57.260 --> 00:11:02.210
let him eat his, but yeah, he was 75 years old,

155
00:11:02.211 --> 00:11:05.780
75 year old. I still have the shoes today.

156
00:11:06.490 --> 00:11:08.990
There were like $700 shoes that was worth it.

157
00:11:09.830 --> 00:11:12.140
<v 4>You've been put in charge of running. Heck</v>

158
00:11:14.300 --> 00:11:17.360
the afterlife for people not evil enough for hell.

159
00:11:18.170 --> 00:11:21.080
What's the first torture you design.

160
00:11:22.130 --> 00:11:26.870
Oh yeah. It's just, I just have them wait in a lot of lines. You know,

161
00:11:27.500 --> 00:11:30.560
like lines are kind of the worst thing and you know what I would have,

162
00:11:30.860 --> 00:11:32.000
I would make it so that the,

163
00:11:32.040 --> 00:11:36.170
the waiting line that they're in has a bunch of other people having public

164
00:11:36.200 --> 00:11:38.210
speaker phone and FaceTime conversations.

165
00:11:38.630 --> 00:11:41.330
So they're just sitting there and they're like, well, everyone shut the other.

166
00:11:41.480 --> 00:11:43.250
One's like, no, we gotta keep talking. So like,

167
00:11:43.251 --> 00:11:46.520
it's just like just makes them crazy that everyone would shut up. You know,

168
00:11:49.070 --> 00:11:51.260
that's, that's what Garth Brooks is going to suffer. One day.

169
00:11:51.860 --> 00:11:53.800
You can have sex with anyone want.

170
00:11:54.010 --> 00:11:58.390
<v 0>But they die immediately after who or Oh,</v>

171
00:11:58.510 --> 00:11:59.800
or just who do you have sex with?

172
00:12:04.110 --> 00:12:08.890
Throw. I got one for you. A Casey Anthony.

173
00:12:11.520 --> 00:12:15.000
That's a great answer. Call me, call me Dick justice.

174
00:12:16.350 --> 00:12:17.190
That's for Kaylee

175
00:12:21.270 --> 00:12:23.550
thing to say after you come and kill ya, that one was,

176
00:12:26.960 --> 00:12:28.860
I don't think that was wrong, either dumb. Right?

177
00:12:28.920 --> 00:12:31.980
Other than everyone agrees with me, you don't have the balls to push it.

178
00:12:33.240 --> 00:12:34.073
I'm coming for

179
00:12:36.260 --> 00:12:39.180
that wrong spark. You that little girl,

180
00:12:40.710 --> 00:12:44.580
would you rather sit down with your parents and watch every sexual encounter

181
00:12:44.581 --> 00:12:48.420
they ever had the internet, the internet,

182
00:12:49.940 --> 00:12:52.980
or you gotta watch the sex tape, but when your parents conceived, you.
