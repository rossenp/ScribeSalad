00:00:00.420 --> 00:00:03.360
<v 0>Hey, what's up. I'm Logan, Paul, and I'm here to answer the internet.</v>

2
00:00:10.040 --> 00:00:10.240
<v 1>[Inaudible].</v>

3
00:00:10.240 --> 00:00:13.430
<v 0>You can fight one person to the death and switch lives with them. If you win,</v>

4
00:00:14.060 --> 00:00:16.640
who would you fight Bieber

5
00:00:18.650 --> 00:00:21.620
coming for you Bieber. I want your life Bieber. I want to wear it.

6
00:00:21.710 --> 00:00:24.440
I want to wear that skinnier as Bieber was good dog.

7
00:00:26.540 --> 00:00:31.250
Would you rather orgasm every time you hear all star by smash mouth or hear

8
00:00:31.790 --> 00:00:35.720
all-star every time you orgasm. Whew. That's a,

9
00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:40.730
that's a smash song and it almost be like a dope soundtrack to

10
00:00:40.731 --> 00:00:44.600
my sex life. So definitely I'd love to hear all star every time I Oregon.

11
00:00:47.570 --> 00:00:47.960
<v 1>Ooh.</v>

12
00:00:47.960 --> 00:00:51.620
<v 0>What's the grossest thing you've ever Snapchatted. This is bad.</v>

13
00:00:52.430 --> 00:00:57.050
I sent my mom a new dog. No, but hold up. It's it's there's an asterix.

14
00:00:57.051 --> 00:01:02.030
I put an emoji over my, uh, penis. Was it intentional?

15
00:01:02.060 --> 00:01:02.893
Yes.

16
00:01:04.820 --> 00:01:05.300
<v 1>Come loudly.</v>

17
00:01:05.300 --> 00:01:08.150
<v 0>Every time you fart or fart loudly. Every time you come.</v>

18
00:01:10.190 --> 00:01:11.023
<v 1>Come on.</v>

19
00:01:12.680 --> 00:01:15.740
<v 0>Yo. Uh, coming, coming is dope,</v>

20
00:01:16.790 --> 00:01:17.750
but so as far ding.

21
00:01:19.130 --> 00:01:23.450
So if you could do both at once pro com com loudly every time you fart.

22
00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:28.490
That's cool. That's tight. Who writes these questions?

23
00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:33.080
Would you rather a goat? And nobody knows, or you don't go,

24
00:01:33.081 --> 00:01:37.970
but everybody thinks you're dead. No, I've heard this before.

25
00:01:38.090 --> 00:01:42.770
Oh man. I've thought about this one. I don't think,

26
00:01:42.771 --> 00:01:44.690
I don't think I could ever a go.

27
00:01:44.750 --> 00:01:48.050
I couldn't like I'm cool with everyone thinking I a goat.

28
00:01:49.640 --> 00:01:52.040
That's fine with me, dude. Like, come on. I've done some weird.

29
00:01:53.210 --> 00:01:56.660
Like everyone thinks I have a micro penis, but that one's true.

30
00:01:59.570 --> 00:02:03.830
Would you rather, every time you laugh, a dog dies. Every time you fall in love.

31
00:02:03.831 --> 00:02:04.850
There's a genocide.

32
00:02:13.190 --> 00:02:15.050
<v 1>What is sick question?</v>

33
00:02:17.060 --> 00:02:19.700
<v 0>Oh no, no, no, no. I know the answer I hear. Here's the deal.</v>

34
00:02:22.130 --> 00:02:22.963
It's so bad.

35
00:02:25.160 --> 00:02:27.230
I love my dog lives and I love laughing.

36
00:02:27.260 --> 00:02:30.560
So I don't think I could kill a dog every time I laughed. But, uh,

37
00:02:30.620 --> 00:02:33.470
it and I fall in love a few times, dude. Like,

38
00:02:34.400 --> 00:02:37.640
so probably the genocide is bad as it's like, Oh no, wait, stop everyone.

39
00:02:37.641 --> 00:02:42.620
Stop please. No, it's not like that. I mean, just I'm like,

40
00:02:42.790 --> 00:02:45.560
I don't fall in love often if ever like you're safe.

41
00:02:46.040 --> 00:02:48.680
Some country or large group of people is safe.

42
00:02:48.920 --> 00:02:51.410
Would you rather lose a leg or never have sex? Again? Get rid of the like,

43
00:02:51.650 --> 00:02:53.960
the leg. I don't need my legs. Both of them.

44
00:02:54.500 --> 00:02:58.640
Would you rather suck one Dick for 50 K. Okay.

45
00:02:59.470 --> 00:03:04.060
Would you rather suck one Dick for 500 K or get five K for every Dickie suck.

46
00:03:04.390 --> 00:03:05.650
Let's do like 550.

47
00:03:06.250 --> 00:03:11.080
Would you rather suck one Dick for 50 K or get 5k for every Dick? You suck.

48
00:03:11.230 --> 00:03:12.520
So I would have to suck 50.

49
00:03:13.180 --> 00:03:16.780
Like I can make all the money then I'm I'm out of money I make is on me. Oh,

50
00:03:16.781 --> 00:03:20.920
that's dope, man. I probably go with that one. Dick.

51
00:03:22.330 --> 00:03:25.330
You can do a lot with half a million dollars. My. This question.

52
00:03:33.120 --> 00:03:33.953
<v 1>[Inaudible].</v>

53
00:03:34.920 --> 00:03:39.330
<v 0>Would you rather be falsely accused of murder or never be able to stop coming?</v>

54
00:03:44.450 --> 00:03:45.570
<v 1>Does that even make sense.</v>

55
00:03:45.930 --> 00:03:48.690
<v 0>Man? Just to come, could get in the way of things I need to do.</v>

56
00:03:49.410 --> 00:03:50.243
<v 1>So.</v>

57
00:03:51.090 --> 00:03:54.510
<v 0>No, no, no. I make YouTube videos. No, bro. I make YouTube videos.</v>

58
00:03:54.511 --> 00:03:57.270
I don't need to like apply for jobs and. Like I can be blacklisted.

59
00:03:57.630 --> 00:04:01.200
What's the weirdest thing you've masturbated to bro. Oh man.

60
00:04:05.280 --> 00:04:06.113
<v 1>Aye.</v>

61
00:04:07.050 --> 00:04:11.490
<v 0>I used to have sex with my body pillow bro. Shut up. Everyone did don't lie.</v>

62
00:04:12.600 --> 00:04:16.320
No, come on, dude. Everyone like a couch cushion bro.

63
00:04:17.490 --> 00:04:21.350
<v 1>I definitely you're the weird one. I</v>

64
00:04:23.020 --> 00:04:23.853
don't say that.

65
00:04:24.150 --> 00:04:28.770
<v 0>Every, every pre pubescent, teenage boy, adolescent, adolescent lad,</v>

66
00:04:29.040 --> 00:04:32.730
you a couch and you think that's cool. Don't outta here bro.

67
00:04:32.970 --> 00:04:37.140
You're a weirdo starting today. If you get $10,000 a day for every day,

68
00:04:37.141 --> 00:04:42.120
you don't. How many days could you go without jerking off? Forever. Forever.

69
00:04:42.180 --> 00:04:46.030
Literally forever bro. I be, I be chilling. Yeah, I'll be my,

70
00:04:46.031 --> 00:04:49.620
my libido has been low dude. All I do is grind. I don't even like sex.

71
00:04:50.490 --> 00:04:54.750
Would you rather sit on like would you rather sit on a cake and eat a Dick

72
00:04:56.610 --> 00:04:58.350
or sit on a Dick and eat a cookie

73
00:05:01.680 --> 00:05:06.600
Who's who's who's I let's let me let's preface this. Who's providing the Dick.

74
00:05:06.601 --> 00:05:10.630
Like where does one? Just have a Dick available for consumption. I choose who,

75
00:05:10.830 --> 00:05:12.390
whose Dick it is. Oh, that's tight.

76
00:05:15.630 --> 00:05:19.920
I probably sit on the cake and eat the Dick, but who's they would've been bro.

77
00:05:20.370 --> 00:05:23.850
Oh, wait, will you sit on a Dick? Is, is the Dick is a flacid? No.

78
00:05:25.200 --> 00:05:29.010
<v 1>So that's the appeal of not sitting on the deck? I feel it. I feel it.</v>

79
00:05:31.140 --> 00:05:33.300
<v 0>I don't know if I, I don't know if I be cool with that one.</v>

80
00:05:33.840 --> 00:05:35.970
If every time you finished sex, a song played,

81
00:05:36.240 --> 00:05:40.260
which song would you want it to be? Eye of the tiger for sure.

82
00:05:41.820 --> 00:05:45.900
I have the tag and I can just cheer and run around the room. I've done that.

83
00:05:46.050 --> 00:05:50.250
I'm not even kidding. I've done that. My ex hated me for it. I'd play.

84
00:05:50.251 --> 00:05:51.084
We are the champs.

85
00:05:53.300 --> 00:05:55.470
<v 1>Oh man. No, no.</v>

86
00:05:55.470 --> 00:05:57.680
<v 0>You know what song I play aloe black.</v>

87
00:05:57.710 --> 00:06:01.970
I'm the man that you can go and tell everybody. Yeah,

88
00:06:02.270 --> 00:06:04.130
I hate myself. Next question.

89
00:06:04.610 --> 00:06:09.290
Would you punch your grandmother in the face to the girl of your dreams?

90
00:06:09.860 --> 00:06:12.800
Oh my God. Hey

91
00:06:15.250 --> 00:06:18.490
and Joanne, I love you, grandma, grandma. Joanne. I love you.

92
00:06:18.491 --> 00:06:20.350
But I would knock you the out.

93
00:06:21.550 --> 00:06:23.920
<v 1>Cold cold.</v>

94
00:06:25.630 --> 00:06:27.370
<v 0>The one cartoon character you would bang.</v>

95
00:06:27.670 --> 00:06:30.610
The first one that comes to mind honestly, is the Tasmanian devil.

96
00:06:31.480 --> 00:06:33.850
That is a spinner.

97
00:06:34.240 --> 00:06:36.220
<v 1>Quite literally, quite literally.</v>

98
00:06:37.030 --> 00:06:40.270
<v 0>I had to wear one mascot head during sex for the rest of your life.</v>

99
00:06:40.300 --> 00:06:41.380
Which one would you choose?

100
00:06:45.010 --> 00:06:45.843
<v 1>I don't know why.</v>

101
00:06:46.900 --> 00:06:50.170
<v 0>That's what I'm saying. So the first thing came to my mind was a lobster and I,</v>

102
00:06:50.860 --> 00:06:54.430
and I don't know why I that's why?

103
00:06:54.700 --> 00:06:58.330
Cause on the Amanda show way back in the day, I might be dating myself here,

104
00:06:58.331 --> 00:07:01.660
but she'd say bring in the dancing lobsters. I always thought they were so hot.

105
00:07:02.140 --> 00:07:03.220
If you were dating a 10,

106
00:07:03.221 --> 00:07:06.400
but at nighttime she turned into a hideous creature like Fiona from Shrek.

107
00:07:06.401 --> 00:07:09.730
Would you still date her? Yeah, absolutely. Absolutely.

108
00:07:11.230 --> 00:07:15.430
Absolutely. Also I have pink eye. Can you tell,

109
00:07:17.110 --> 00:07:19.480
okay. I just looked at the camera and like I felt that one,

110
00:07:19.481 --> 00:07:22.120
I was a little smaller. I'm like absolutely.

111
00:07:22.630 --> 00:07:26.050
Would you date a girl knowing all of her previous exes are dead.

112
00:07:29.260 --> 00:07:32.800
<v 1>Oh, probably not. No.</v>

113
00:07:33.940 --> 00:07:36.850
You gotta think like probably not black window type thing.

114
00:07:36.910 --> 00:07:40.450
<v 0>For sure. She's for sure. She's black widow, bro. For sure. She's black.</v>

115
00:07:40.570 --> 00:07:44.560
She kills him and sucks the power out of there. I can't do that.

116
00:07:44.620 --> 00:07:45.330
I don't want any.

117
00:07:45.330 --> 00:07:45.700
<v 1>That smoke.</v>
