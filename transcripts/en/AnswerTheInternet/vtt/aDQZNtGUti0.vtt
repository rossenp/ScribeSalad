00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:02.280
<v 0>Oh, hello. I'm Jimmy Carr and I'm answering the internet.</v>

2
00:00:09.080 --> 00:00:11.900
I mean, good luck everyone. I've also got special ed. That's why I'm doing this.

3
00:00:12.770 --> 00:00:16.460
It's not even a proper office. It's like a fraternity. Anyway. Um,

4
00:00:16.940 --> 00:00:21.890
who was the one celebrity, uh, you would want at your funeral? Uh,

5
00:00:22.490 --> 00:00:26.780
I, I, I mean, it's a funeral, isn't it? It's,

6
00:00:27.440 --> 00:00:28.730
he's the purpose celebrity.

7
00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:31.190
<v 2>I think the, I think the.</v>

8
00:00:31.190 --> 00:00:34.940
<v 0>Pope will give you a good send wouldn't he? Um, I would say, uh,</v>

9
00:00:34.970 --> 00:00:37.790
maybe I'm going to go with the obvious, I would say.

10
00:00:39.190 --> 00:00:40.100
<v 2>Oh, O J.</v>

11
00:00:40.940 --> 00:00:44.030
<v 0>Yeah. Cause I think funerals are so dull. Right? So funeral, like I die,</v>

12
00:00:44.031 --> 00:00:46.160
my friends and family are like, Oh no, that's awful.

13
00:00:46.280 --> 00:00:49.970
But I know they all watched the eight hour OJ documentary and they have

14
00:00:49.971 --> 00:00:51.830
questions. And if he was there,

15
00:00:51.980 --> 00:00:54.470
I guess over the finger sandwiches in the reception,

16
00:00:54.590 --> 00:00:56.000
you would have to answer the questions.

17
00:00:56.180 --> 00:00:58.310
And that would maybe take the edge off the day. Go.

18
00:00:58.311 --> 00:01:00.170
What was it like the day you buried Jimmy? Aw.

19
00:01:00.530 --> 00:01:02.690
<v 2>We met OJ weird.</v>

20
00:01:04.250 --> 00:01:09.080
<v 0>Okay. Would you rather be bald by the age of 20 or five foot?</v>

21
00:01:09.081 --> 00:01:13.670
Three with a full head of hair, so short or bald? I would go.

22
00:01:13.671 --> 00:01:17.960
And this is just from talking to two ladies who are cruel. Um,

23
00:01:18.350 --> 00:01:21.830
I think, I think height is more important than hair for that,

24
00:01:21.860 --> 00:01:23.750
for the finest sex. And I think if you were going,

25
00:01:23.900 --> 00:01:27.860
presumably that is an aesthetics thing to attract a mate and breed.

26
00:01:28.160 --> 00:01:30.470
I think I'm going to have to go bald age 20.

27
00:01:30.500 --> 00:01:33.470
And hopefully I had a good shape head because you can get a wig,

28
00:01:33.500 --> 00:01:36.830
but I don't think you can get a foot's worth of platform heel.

29
00:01:37.610 --> 00:01:41.900
Would you rather give up sex or porn for one year?

30
00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:43.400
When you say give up sex,

31
00:01:43.401 --> 00:01:46.820
do you mean like five minutes in this isn't going anywhere love.

32
00:01:47.570 --> 00:01:51.320
Should we just pop Netflix on? I hear Jimmy. Car's got a new special.

33
00:01:52.600 --> 00:01:57.470
Do you mean give up like that or do you mean give up no sex or pornography?

34
00:01:57.500 --> 00:02:01.430
I actually gave up, uh, porn recently. Um, yeah, I don't watch porn. You know.

35
00:02:05.810 --> 00:02:07.760
<v 2>I finished up, I put my initials in at the end.</v>

36
00:02:09.480 --> 00:02:13.280
<v 0>Uh, would you rather have a girl who talks too much during sex or is completely</v>

37
00:02:13.281 --> 00:02:16.100
silent? It makes no different in my basement.

38
00:02:19.910 --> 00:02:20.900
<v 2>They're never leaving. Um.</v>

39
00:02:23.510 --> 00:02:27.350
<v 0>Would you rather know when you're going to die or how you're going to die?</v>

40
00:02:27.800 --> 00:02:32.390
I would re I would rather know the, when the one would be great. The how, yeah,

41
00:02:32.930 --> 00:02:35.030
but the wind would be great. You could really plan.

42
00:02:35.270 --> 00:02:40.040
I had a friend that died two years ago. Genuinely lived very wealthy, man.

43
00:02:40.130 --> 00:02:44.780
We all thought he was a billionaire he's lost check, bounced, killing.

44
00:02:44.780 --> 00:02:45.613
<v 2>It.</v>

45
00:02:47.510 --> 00:02:52.100
<v 0>Would you rather have a dog's personality and a cat's body? I mean that's,</v>

46
00:02:52.160 --> 00:02:54.950
I mean, yes. I don't have to read any further.

47
00:02:55.700 --> 00:03:00.250
What a dog personally, in a cat's body, if we can manufacture these,

48
00:03:00.251 --> 00:03:03.070
let's stop doing this podcast nonsense. Let's do that.

49
00:03:03.071 --> 00:03:06.670
Let's put all our money into that. I can't personally in a dog's body.

50
00:03:07.360 --> 00:03:09.880
It's just, would you rather a dog that was a Dick?

51
00:03:11.140 --> 00:03:15.160
Would you rather a dog that didn't really like you or the most amazing cat has

52
00:03:15.161 --> 00:03:16.930
ever been a toughie?

53
00:03:19.420 --> 00:03:23.950
Would you rather go to jail for one year or go to jail with a Rubik's

54
00:03:23.951 --> 00:03:26.230
cube and you can leave when it's done?

55
00:03:27.720 --> 00:03:30.960
<v 2>Yeah. Think about it. How long would it take to do a Rubik's cube? Ah,</v>

56
00:03:31.440 --> 00:03:35.280
about 10 minutes here. I mean, have you ever done

57
00:03:36.840 --> 00:03:38.100
yes. Special needs presenters?

58
00:03:40.410 --> 00:03:43.260
<v 0>Would you rather be blind or dickless?</v>

59
00:03:45.030 --> 00:03:47.760
Can I be both? Um,

60
00:03:48.840 --> 00:03:53.730
Dick like fully like Ken smooth? Yep. Have I always been Ken smooth? Nope.

61
00:03:53.760 --> 00:03:55.350
You had it removed. Had it removed.

62
00:03:55.440 --> 00:03:57.840
<v 2>You also had site and got written. Then you went blind.</v>

63
00:03:58.620 --> 00:04:01.530
<v 0>I would go, uh, I think, Hm.</v>

64
00:04:02.340 --> 00:04:07.200
I think what am I 46. I'll go. Dickless I've had, I mean,

65
00:04:07.290 --> 00:04:08.550
the wear and tear on that thing.

66
00:04:08.850 --> 00:04:13.050
Probably the upkeep I get so much done.

67
00:04:14.040 --> 00:04:16.980
You know, when you go on the, the pornography, so you call it the internet.

68
00:04:17.010 --> 00:04:17.843
I called it the pornography.

69
00:04:18.570 --> 00:04:20.850
But when you finished with the pornography and book, train tickets and stuff,

70
00:04:21.070 --> 00:04:24.750
be great. Which fictional character would you love to beat the out of?

71
00:04:25.140 --> 00:04:25.973
<v 2>I guess.</v>

72
00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:30.030
<v 0>Which fictional character would you love to beat the out of? I'm going to go,</v>

73
00:04:30.031 --> 00:04:33.510
Jesus, I'm going to go Jesus.

74
00:04:34.230 --> 00:04:37.530
And it's going to be one he's on the cross. It's worse than you thought it was.

75
00:04:37.980 --> 00:04:39.450
It's me just piling on.

76
00:04:41.730 --> 00:04:43.980
<v 2>Is that bad? That's it right there.</v>
