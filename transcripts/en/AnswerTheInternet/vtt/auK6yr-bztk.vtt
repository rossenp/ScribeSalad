1
00:00:01.060 --> 00:00:03.970
<v 0>I'm about.</v>

2
00:00:04.880 --> 00:00:06.450
<v 1>To answer the internet. I had bronchitis.</v>

3
00:00:13.700 --> 00:00:17.120
Would you rather know when you're going to die or how you're going to die?

4
00:00:18.680 --> 00:00:20.120
Dang, these are good questions.

5
00:00:20.810 --> 00:00:25.790
I would rather know how I'm going to die because I'd rather know like what to

6
00:00:25.791 --> 00:00:27.980
know indoors or outdoors, probably.

7
00:00:27.981 --> 00:00:32.120
So I can kind of be prepared on how to not dress, but how to, like,

8
00:00:32.121 --> 00:00:33.830
I don't want to die in the wrong shoes, you know,

9
00:00:34.670 --> 00:00:38.660
would you rather have a dog's personality and a cat body or a cat's personality

10
00:00:38.810 --> 00:00:43.220
and adult body? I'm not sure exactly, but I don't want to be a cat at all.

11
00:00:43.790 --> 00:00:47.600
So whatever one of these is not being a cat, you know, um.

12
00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:51.110
<v 0>See that's the thing you would have the dog body, but the brain of a cat.</v>

13
00:00:51.380 --> 00:00:55.190
So you kind of are a cat, but then the other way you'd have the body of a cat.

14
00:00:55.191 --> 00:00:56.300
Everyone would think you're a cat.

15
00:00:56.660 --> 00:01:00.230
So would you rather know you're a cat or have other people think you're a cat?

16
00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:03.560
<v 1>I'd rather probably do euthanasia, you know? Yeah.</v>

17
00:01:03.590 --> 00:01:06.440
No offense to cats or anything, but also cats.

18
00:01:07.160 --> 00:01:10.520
So basically there's pieces of loneliness that are in your apartment.

19
00:01:11.270 --> 00:01:14.510
If you had to pick one person to be the ambassador for the human race to meet

20
00:01:14.511 --> 00:01:19.130
aliens, who would it be? Ooh, this is good. I probably pay,

21
00:01:22.670 --> 00:01:26.120
um, I'll be a Filipino dude. I'm really infatuated about Filipinos.

22
00:01:26.360 --> 00:01:28.340
They're happy. They're joyous. You know,

23
00:01:28.341 --> 00:01:32.300
they call them the smiling people somewhere on the internet. And um,

24
00:01:32.660 --> 00:01:34.670
and every Filipino I meet, they're real gracious.

25
00:01:34.671 --> 00:01:39.020
They do a lot of senior care centers, hospice. So you don't,

26
00:01:39.410 --> 00:01:41.750
who else are you going to send out there, dude? You know what I'm saying?

27
00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:43.760
A drunk, you know, uh,

28
00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:47.690
somebody from Scotland know somebody on Coke and can't do any of that.

29
00:01:47.780 --> 00:01:50.270
You got to send somebody who is caring, I think.

30
00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:55.850
<v 0>Can you just say like the RA? Oh, you mean like a specific person? You know,</v>

31
00:01:56.120 --> 00:02:01.040
who's good on Filipino. Yeah, yeah, yeah.

32
00:02:01.370 --> 00:02:02.720
<v 1>Maybe Manny Pacquiao there.</v>

33
00:02:02.900 --> 00:02:06.680
Would you rather be blind or dickless dude these days? Probably dickless.

34
00:02:06.681 --> 00:02:10.340
I think I had a blind kid in my neighborhood when I was growing up. And uh,

35
00:02:10.610 --> 00:02:13.490
actually, you know, this dude was deaf actually. And,

36
00:02:14.210 --> 00:02:17.840
and they beat him up for doing bad magic because he was always doing all of this

37
00:02:17.841 --> 00:02:21.050
and and people thought he was doing magic with no tricks and they beat him.

38
00:02:21.320 --> 00:02:26.240
So would you rather go to jail for one year or go to jail with a Rubik's

39
00:02:26.241 --> 00:02:28.130
cube and you can leave what it's done?

40
00:02:29.060 --> 00:02:29.893
<v 0>Yeah.</v>

41
00:02:33.560 --> 00:02:38.300
<v 1>Science one. Huh? I would rather, I go to jail for a year.</v>

42
00:02:38.480 --> 00:02:42.620
I think it'd be great. These days, relaxing, get some reading done,

43
00:02:43.370 --> 00:02:47.090
you know, get in shape, you know, get beat up and rape them.

44
00:02:47.420 --> 00:02:48.770
Get some diverse friends.

45
00:02:49.310 --> 00:02:52.940
<v 0>Okay. How long is it? You do receive a Rubik's cube.</v>

46
00:02:53.960 --> 00:02:55.220
I bet I could probably do it in a week,

47
00:02:58.880 --> 00:03:00.760
so, but you'll take the year.

48
00:03:00.820 --> 00:03:03.010
<v 1>Oh dude. I'd love to have some time to just relax, honestly.</v>

49
00:03:03.160 --> 00:03:04.810
And I'm a pretty simple man, as long as yeah.

50
00:03:04.870 --> 00:03:07.060
If I'm in there are the lights on at night though.

51
00:03:07.061 --> 00:03:08.530
That would be the part that would exist.

52
00:03:09.910 --> 00:03:12.700
Would you rather have everyone naked all the time or everyone closed all the

53
00:03:12.701 --> 00:03:16.090
time? I'm okay. Pretty much with how things are.

54
00:03:16.091 --> 00:03:17.950
I think so I would say clothes.

55
00:03:20.050 --> 00:03:23.230
It's a big question to ask and just assume somebody is going to change it.

56
00:03:23.231 --> 00:03:24.160
Based on that question,

57
00:03:24.850 --> 00:03:27.820
would you rather sit down with your parents and watch every sexual encounter

58
00:03:27.821 --> 00:03:30.700
you've had or watch your parents' sex tape when they conceived you?

59
00:03:32.770 --> 00:03:35.830
I don't know, man. My dad was 70 when I was born, so, Oh.

60
00:03:37.240 --> 00:03:39.970
I probably watched a tape, honestly, man, I think it would be cool.

61
00:03:39.971 --> 00:03:42.130
Would almost be artistic these days.

62
00:03:42.310 --> 00:03:45.550
I'd be looked at it more as art than it would be as something to deviant.

63
00:03:46.390 --> 00:03:49.240
Do you think there was more porn stars or murders in the world?

64
00:03:49.900 --> 00:03:51.820
I think murderers, you know,

65
00:03:52.540 --> 00:03:55.000
I actually know a guy probably shouldn't say this on here,

66
00:03:55.001 --> 00:03:59.350
but I'm not gonna say names, but I know a guy who killed someone and he said,

67
00:03:59.860 --> 00:04:02.320
and this isn't me saying this dude, I wouldn't do something like this.

68
00:04:02.650 --> 00:04:04.360
But he said that it feels good.

69
00:04:06.910 --> 00:04:07.780
And he did say that.

70
00:04:09.300 --> 00:04:11.880
<v 0>Do you know how he murdered them? Do you know how he murdered him?</v>

71
00:04:12.120 --> 00:04:13.500
<v 1>I don't know anything else, man. Let me see that.</v>

72
00:04:14.490 --> 00:04:19.080
Would you take $4 million to be able to catch a predator? Um, I would take it,

73
00:04:19.410 --> 00:04:21.150
uh, I would take about $700 back.

74
00:04:21.360 --> 00:04:24.840
Cause Chris Hanson was on my podcast and he tried to run up a bunch of hotel

75
00:04:24.841 --> 00:04:28.140
bills with spa stuff, extra spot treatments and stuff like that.

76
00:04:28.141 --> 00:04:32.760
So Chris Hanson tried to me on about $730. You know, getting Rose pedals and.

77
00:04:34.980 --> 00:04:37.590
Well, Adam, as soon as he called you names, but I wouldn't do that to you.

78
00:04:37.980 --> 00:04:41.610
And I would appreciate that. You know, you shouldn't try to do that to us.

79
00:04:41.611 --> 00:04:45.900
Cause we were trying to be, you know, some Patty co what STD,

80
00:04:45.930 --> 00:04:46.980
how many of these do you have do this.

81
00:04:47.970 --> 00:04:49.500
<v 0>But I'll stop eventually. Don't worry.</v>

82
00:04:51.570 --> 00:04:54.330
<v 1>Uh, what STD would you be willing to have if you were able to pass it onto your</v>

83
00:04:54.331 --> 00:04:57.420
biggest enemy? I'd probably say something new,

84
00:04:58.170 --> 00:05:00.840
something they wouldn't see coming, you know? Uh,

85
00:05:01.110 --> 00:05:04.800
some of that seems fun and then it's, and then it's not, and then you, you know,

86
00:05:04.801 --> 00:05:06.630
it's not fun and you die. So.

87
00:05:07.140 --> 00:05:08.340
<v 0>STD seems like it's fun.</v>

88
00:05:08.970 --> 00:05:13.830
<v 1>Something's fun out of the gate. Some of that sounds good. You know, like, uh,</v>

89
00:05:14.730 --> 00:05:17.640
I don't know. There's some foods that also sound like STDs or Def Leppard.

90
00:05:17.641 --> 00:05:22.320
That sounds like an STD. Which fictional character would you love to be

91
00:05:23.820 --> 00:05:27.300
beat the out of dude? I don't know if I can meet a lot of people.

92
00:05:27.301 --> 00:05:29.970
I think I could beat that dude from the mask. You ever seen that movie mask,

93
00:05:30.360 --> 00:05:34.710
but Rocky Dennis, I could fight that dude. I bet who else? Probably Rosie.

94
00:05:34.711 --> 00:05:38.580
O'Donnell that's not a fictional character. That's a real person. Depends on me.

95
00:05:38.581 --> 00:05:39.414
Yeah,

96
00:05:41.910 --> 00:05:43.740
But I'll shut that thick fella down.

97
00:05:43.741 --> 00:05:48.090
You know that if you were sent back to the Roman empire with a fully shards,

98
00:05:48.100 --> 00:05:50.400
iPhone, do you think you could take over the world?

99
00:05:53.070 --> 00:05:54.840
no, dude. I think he would probably beat you up.

100
00:05:54.870 --> 00:05:56.370
They would say you're gay and they would beat you

101
00:06:00.220 --> 00:06:05.020
To be honest and no offense. If anybody's down, I might be gay. So this is it.

102
00:06:05.220 --> 00:06:08.620
Yeah. And no offense to you. I just don't have anything else to say.

103
00:06:08.621 --> 00:06:09.880
And I feel bad talking this much.

104
00:06:10.120 --> 00:06:12.880
How long would it take for you to drink all the water and above ground pool?

105
00:06:14.050 --> 00:06:14.883
Oh man, this is.

106
00:06:15.160 --> 00:06:17.500
<v 0>Good, dude. I.</v>

107
00:06:17.500 --> 00:06:19.120
<v 1>Don't know, man, probably.</v>

108
00:06:22.420 --> 00:06:25.660
<v 0>I bet a year and a half. It's a very solid answer.</v>

109
00:06:25.661 --> 00:06:26.890
You'd be surprised how many people are like.

110
00:06:27.700 --> 00:06:31.870
<v 1>Oh, no way, dude, bro. And also you can't drink consecutive.</v>

111
00:06:31.930 --> 00:06:34.540
You can only drink about a gallon straight before like the electrolytes in your

112
00:06:34.541 --> 00:06:36.850
body switch up and you can die. So dude,

113
00:06:36.851 --> 00:06:41.200
I drank a gallon in my buddy Tim's house. One time went to take a nap, bro.

114
00:06:41.740 --> 00:06:45.760
on his floor, 12 by 12 square foot room dude.

115
00:06:45.761 --> 00:06:48.100
And the pool touched all four walls, bro.

116
00:06:51.430 --> 00:06:53.890
But thank you guys so much for having me, man. I appreciate it. Yeah.

117
00:06:54.370 --> 00:06:57.190
Thanks a lot. Yeah, you bet, man. That was so much fun, dude.
