00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:03.750
<v 0>Hey, I'm uh, Bob Saget. I know. Hold your applause. And, uh,</v>

2
00:00:04.080 --> 00:00:06.210
this is answer to the internet. That's what this is.

3
00:00:06.530 --> 00:00:07.363
<v 1>Here's a card.</v>

4
00:00:14.390 --> 00:00:16.640
<v 0>We're in an open field. You can't right, dude.</v>

5
00:00:17.240 --> 00:00:19.370
We're an open field arm with a baseball bat.

6
00:00:19.400 --> 00:00:21.380
How many ten-year-olds wearing bike helmets.

7
00:00:21.381 --> 00:00:24.050
Could you take down before they got to you? That's funny.

8
00:00:24.051 --> 00:00:27.470
I'm like Thor with my hammer. I would just take that bat and I would just,

9
00:00:28.370 --> 00:00:30.620
and we would just go around and I wouldn't hurt the kids.

10
00:00:30.621 --> 00:00:33.590
I'd knock the bikes out from under them. That's a teach them a lesson.

11
00:00:34.700 --> 00:00:36.380
<v 1>I don't know. I got a.</v>

12
00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:38.750
<v 0>How many kids am I going to beat? I'm not going to beat kids.</v>

13
00:00:39.350 --> 00:00:43.910
I got my own children. I got TV kids all around me. They're not,

14
00:00:43.970 --> 00:00:46.130
they didn't say they were like little gnomes or something.

15
00:00:46.360 --> 00:00:47.193
<v 1>Yeah. They're they're angry.</v>

16
00:00:49.370 --> 00:00:49.581
<v 0>Well,</v>

17
00:00:49.581 --> 00:00:52.850
I'll pick up one kid and throw it at the other kid and knock them all over.

18
00:00:53.780 --> 00:00:56.450
I got nothing. You got me. You got me. You asked me questions.

19
00:00:56.451 --> 00:00:59.540
You would ask Lenny of mice and men. Okay. That's a book.

20
00:01:00.770 --> 00:01:03.680
Would you rather watch your dad have sex with a a hundred year old man?

21
00:01:03.681 --> 00:01:06.380
Or watch your mom kill someone? Actually,

22
00:01:06.650 --> 00:01:10.820
those are both very attractive options because they're both passed on. So, um,

23
00:01:11.300 --> 00:01:15.410
I think it doesn't really matter cause they're both gone. Uh, my dad,

24
00:01:15.500 --> 00:01:19.820
my mother was a a hundred year old man. So, um, and,

25
00:01:19.850 --> 00:01:24.080
and right when my dad and her had sex at a hundred, she passed on.

26
00:01:24.081 --> 00:01:28.550
So I would say, please delete. This is your awesome.

27
00:01:28.970 --> 00:01:32.420
I would throw my a hundred year old parents, a little kids. Um,

28
00:01:32.450 --> 00:01:36.980
could you beat up Tom cruise? No, no. Cause, um,

29
00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:40.580
I don't think I could cause he does his own stunts and I do mine,

30
00:01:42.710 --> 00:01:44.330
but I would, I would, uh,

31
00:01:44.810 --> 00:01:47.180
I would go on a spaceship with him to wherever he believes in.

32
00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:54.080
If you have one person now, uh, narrate, do a play by play of you having sex.

33
00:01:54.081 --> 00:01:55.310
Who would it be? It would be me.

34
00:01:55.520 --> 00:01:59.390
Cause I do the voices like on the video show videos after dark, I'd be like, Oh,

35
00:01:59.391 --> 00:02:03.770
look out. Oh, I'm finishing, you know, things like that. Oh mom get off of me.

36
00:02:03.800 --> 00:02:07.970
Oh, I'm sorry, son, stuff like that. You know that everybody can relate to.

37
00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:12.740
Uh, there are two buttons. One initially gives you 1 million, one.

38
00:02:12.741 --> 00:02:17.240
It gives you 50 50 shot at 100 million. Which do you push?

39
00:02:19.460 --> 00:02:23.630
Who writes these materialistic children? Um,

40
00:02:24.440 --> 00:02:26.570
50, 50 shot. I don't, I don't gamble.

41
00:02:26.630 --> 00:02:30.530
So I guess I would take the 1 million and give it right to charity.

42
00:02:30.890 --> 00:02:35.480
That would stop these kinds of questions being asked. Uh,

43
00:02:35.660 --> 00:02:40.460
if you were to be murdered, who is your most likely suspect? John Stamos? Um,

44
00:02:40.820 --> 00:02:43.160
because he's jealous of my handsome, good looks.

45
00:02:43.790 --> 00:02:48.080
A pigs orgasm lasts for over 30 minutes. I know, um,

46
00:02:48.380 --> 00:02:52.520
a lion can have sex over 50 times per day. Tell me about it. Uh,

47
00:02:52.521 --> 00:02:57.320
which would you rather be? I'd like to be an orgasming pig eaten by a lion.

48
00:03:06.780 --> 00:03:11.100
Would you switch live with Tim? Teebo if you, if, if,

49
00:03:11.250 --> 00:03:14.520
if you do, you have to remain, you can't right.

50
00:03:15.300 --> 00:03:18.180
You can't go to school. How do you have a show?

51
00:03:18.930 --> 00:03:22.500
Would you switch lives with Tim? Teebo uh, if you,

52
00:03:22.560 --> 00:03:27.480
if you have to remain a Virgin and go to church, first thing. Uh, no, no, no.

53
00:03:27.510 --> 00:03:31.860
So, uh, no, I wouldn't switch lives with anybody. I liked my life quite a lot,

54
00:03:31.890 --> 00:03:36.150
except not at this moment. And I have to remain a Virgin a little bit to that.

55
00:03:36.151 --> 00:03:40.680
I lost my virginity at negative four. Um, I lost it in the womb.

56
00:03:41.340 --> 00:03:46.050
Uh, my mom, uh, nevermind, but it was a long contraption, uh,

57
00:03:46.800 --> 00:03:50.790
and go to church. I would go to Notre Dame if I could do some work there, um,

58
00:03:50.850 --> 00:03:55.740
and help put the things out and help people maybe

59
00:03:55.770 --> 00:03:57.120
help some charities.

60
00:03:59.640 --> 00:04:03.570
Would you rather have a Dick as your nose or a noses? Your Dick?

61
00:04:03.600 --> 00:04:07.290
Definitely a noses. My Dick. Cause then you could blow my nose.

62
00:04:15.570 --> 00:04:15.840
<v 1>[Inaudible].</v>

63
00:04:15.840 --> 00:04:18.690
<v 0>And I know what upset you, but I'm not on antibiotics,</v>

64
00:04:20.670 --> 00:04:23.670
but it's viral. Take them anyway. Kids.

65
00:04:23.700 --> 00:04:28.170
If people tell you don't take antibiotics because it's not bacteria,

66
00:04:28.171 --> 00:04:32.910
they're full of. Take drugs, no matter what and stay in school.

67
00:04:33.810 --> 00:04:37.200
If you ended a beauty pageant, what would your talent be? Um,

68
00:04:37.230 --> 00:04:41.760
I can make a hemorrhoid poke in and out of my butt. Um, I'm just kidding.

69
00:04:41.820 --> 00:04:45.240
I can do it out of somebody else's but let's take that again.

70
00:04:45.660 --> 00:04:49.020
If you entered a beauty pageant, what would your talent beat? Um,

71
00:04:49.050 --> 00:04:53.430
it would be strangling the people filming this last question.

72
00:04:53.490 --> 00:04:56.010
If there were stats available for every aspect of your life,

73
00:04:56.040 --> 00:05:00.090
what one stat about yourself would you want to know? Um,

74
00:05:00.570 --> 00:05:05.220
am I really a man? I don't think I want to ask that.

75
00:05:06.060 --> 00:05:07.890
Uh, if they're awful quiet in here,

76
00:05:08.600 --> 00:05:11.070
if there were stats available for every aspect of your life,

77
00:05:11.310 --> 00:05:13.440
what one stat about yourself?

78
00:05:13.500 --> 00:05:16.350
Would you want to know how many millimeters long as my team?

79
00:05:19.020 --> 00:05:20.220
<v 1>I just wanted to time. Graham.</v>

80
00:05:21.840 --> 00:05:24.240
<v 0>Thank you so much. Thank you very much. I really appreciate.</v>

81
00:05:24.240 --> 00:05:24.360
<v 1>It.</v>
