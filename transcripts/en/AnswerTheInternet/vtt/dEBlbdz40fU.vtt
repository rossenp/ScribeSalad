00:00:00.240 --> 00:00:02.850
<v 0>Hi, everyone. I'm going to come in and said, I'm here to answer the internet.</v>

2
00:00:05.730 --> 00:00:06.563
<v 1>Um.</v>

3
00:00:12.860 --> 00:00:16.700
<v 0>This looks like a serial killer wrote it. And who did? This is the Zio.</v>

4
00:00:18.410 --> 00:00:21.770
This is someone. Wow. This is alarming. Um,

5
00:00:21.800 --> 00:00:25.940
would you rather be drunk 24, seven or never get drunk ever again?

6
00:00:27.650 --> 00:00:32.630
What about weed? No, it's like sober. Like you got no substance,

7
00:00:32.631 --> 00:00:36.020
so I'm either only wasted or sober forever,

8
00:00:40.190 --> 00:00:43.940
I would. Hmm. I guess never get drunk ever again,

9
00:00:43.970 --> 00:00:47.390
but I would order painkillers from Canada.

10
00:00:49.400 --> 00:00:52.090
Would you, is this your suicide note? I mean, what is

11
00:00:58.790 --> 00:01:02.450
[inaudible] would you rather your internet search history go public or your sex

12
00:01:02.451 --> 00:01:03.650
tape go viral?

13
00:01:05.690 --> 00:01:09.530
I stand behind any sex tapes that I've made. If I'm going to be honest.

14
00:01:09.710 --> 00:01:14.030
And my internet search history includes a lot of Googling,

15
00:01:14.031 --> 00:01:15.140
inspirational quotes.

16
00:01:15.440 --> 00:01:20.270
So I'm going to say a sex tape goes viral because it made Kim Kardashian rich,

17
00:01:20.271 --> 00:01:24.920
and I need to retire. Would you date a guy knowing all of his exes are dead?

18
00:01:25.190 --> 00:01:28.640
Did he kill them? How did they die?

19
00:01:29.420 --> 00:01:33.080
I would love for my guys Xs to be dead. I wouldn't have to Google them all day.

20
00:01:33.290 --> 00:01:38.240
Would you rather orgasm every time you hear all star by smash mouth or hear all

21
00:01:38.241 --> 00:01:40.100
star every time you orgasm.

22
00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:43.730
So every time you call them that that song comes on or like you walk around the

23
00:01:43.731 --> 00:01:48.590
grocery store, it comes on and you come [inaudible]. Um,

24
00:01:49.490 --> 00:01:50.260
I,

25
00:01:50.260 --> 00:01:54.560
I don't want to be at the mercy of smash mouth in public.

26
00:01:55.670 --> 00:01:57.890
Um, so I think I'd rather orgasm.

27
00:01:58.130 --> 00:02:01.160
Every time I heard all star by smash mouth,

28
00:02:01.190 --> 00:02:05.120
but then I would just have to cry, which I do already when I work as, um,

29
00:02:06.050 --> 00:02:10.880
what's one thing a person can say or do that makes you immediately hate them,

30
00:02:11.510 --> 00:02:16.280
um, film their workouts for Instagram. I mean, I'm more, um,

31
00:02:17.090 --> 00:02:20.620
I can do this one. I can do this one watermelon all day.

32
00:02:20.690 --> 00:02:24.890
Can use a gift card on a first date. Um.

33
00:02:26.060 --> 00:02:29.060
Yeah. Thrifty I'm into it. Yeah.

34
00:02:29.090 --> 00:02:33.350
Let's go have a drink at JC. Penny's it. Yes.

35
00:02:33.351 --> 00:02:35.810
I li I mean, of course. I mean,

36
00:02:35.811 --> 00:02:40.760
if it's your only option to get anything that might be a bigger

37
00:02:40.761 --> 00:02:43.640
issue, but it's your only

38
00:02:46.520 --> 00:02:48.620
[inaudible]. If you use a gift card or a first date,

39
00:02:48.621 --> 00:02:51.620
that means you're the kind of person that people like enough to give gift cards

40
00:02:51.621 --> 00:02:52.454
to

41
00:02:59.960 --> 00:03:01.840
[inaudible] ignoring red flags. Okay.

42
00:03:02.170 --> 00:03:06.910
Nobody can spin some negative behavior better than I can gift card on a first

43
00:03:07.270 --> 00:03:08.410
date. Absolute Luli.

44
00:03:08.440 --> 00:03:11.680
Don't put money into something that you don't know what's going to work.

45
00:03:11.681 --> 00:03:14.560
Use that gift card. Good for you, thrifty. I like that.

46
00:03:14.650 --> 00:03:18.490
Would you rather lose a leg or never be able to have sex? Again?

47
00:03:19.090 --> 00:03:23.230
It depends on who it is having sex with is probably it, but I'd rather, um,

48
00:03:25.510 --> 00:03:28.980
would you rather lose, am I allowed to with my one leg? Yeah.

49
00:03:32.440 --> 00:03:37.300
I love that. He's just like, this is a joke. Just please make it just

50
00:03:39.010 --> 00:03:41.380
like, you're like, I'm not I'm you. I feel married again.

51
00:03:41.440 --> 00:03:45.880
Can you just answer the question? Um, Jesus, like,

52
00:03:45.881 --> 00:03:48.580
why is it never ends with these? Um,

53
00:03:50.080 --> 00:03:53.530
would you rather lose a leg or never have sex? Again?

54
00:03:55.780 --> 00:03:58.570
I would rather lose my leg,

55
00:03:58.900 --> 00:04:01.810
reattach my sex robots leg,

56
00:04:01.960 --> 00:04:05.890
and then have sex so that I could be a cyborg. When you go to heaven,

57
00:04:05.891 --> 00:04:10.420
you can only hang out with people who died the same way you died.

58
00:04:10.690 --> 00:04:14.890
How are you trying to go out? Um,

59
00:04:14.950 --> 00:04:19.810
I'm planning on drinking myself to death or falling off a cliff while

60
00:04:19.811 --> 00:04:23.680
taking a selfie because that's very in right now. Would you,

61
00:04:24.490 --> 00:04:27.430
would you have sex with your cousin to win Powerball?

62
00:04:29.680 --> 00:04:33.070
Um, seven, seven 50 million.

63
00:04:33.071 --> 00:04:36.370
Would you have sex with your cousin to win Powerball? Absolutely.

64
00:04:36.910 --> 00:04:40.630
If your belly button was a real button and you could push it once a day to make

65
00:04:40.631 --> 00:04:42.070
anything happen, what would it do?

66
00:04:42.130 --> 00:04:45.670
It would instantly erase a girl's shirt.

67
00:04:45.700 --> 00:04:47.350
If it said Rosie all day,

68
00:04:50.140 --> 00:04:54.130
it would just turn into a regular shirt that people should wear.

69
00:04:55.450 --> 00:05:00.310
Would you rather sit on a cake and eat a Dick or sit on a Dick

70
00:05:00.340 --> 00:05:05.230
and eat a cake? I'd rather if it was my choice,

71
00:05:05.290 --> 00:05:08.620
eat a cake shaped like a deck, but in this case,

72
00:05:08.680 --> 00:05:11.080
I'm going to sit on a Dick and eat.
