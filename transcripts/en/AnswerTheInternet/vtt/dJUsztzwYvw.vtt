00:00:00.150 --> 00:00:03.300
<v 0>Hi, I'm Lisa Ann from Sirius XM, fantasy sports radio.</v>

2
00:00:03.301 --> 00:00:04.710
And I am here for answers.

3
00:00:05.330 --> 00:00:06.163
<v 1>Internet</v>

4
00:00:12.320 --> 00:00:12.380
[inaudible].

5
00:00:12.380 --> 00:00:15.710
<v 0>I think there is more porn stars or murderers in the world.</v>

6
00:00:15.711 --> 00:00:18.320
I read an obsessive amount of news.

7
00:00:18.350 --> 00:00:20.600
There's definitely a lot of murderers out there.

8
00:00:21.140 --> 00:00:25.310
Would you rather be a clown or a magician? Oh, they both freak people out.

9
00:00:26.600 --> 00:00:29.570
Um, I'm going to say a magician because I like to make things disappear.

10
00:00:30.320 --> 00:00:33.230
What's the weirdest thing you've masturbated to.

11
00:00:34.100 --> 00:00:36.050
<v 1>Uh, I.</v>

12
00:00:36.860 --> 00:00:39.590
<v 0>Fantasy sports podcasts. I mean, I hate to admit that,</v>

13
00:00:39.591 --> 00:00:42.470
but sometimes it's on in the background. I'm too lazy to get up and turn it off.

14
00:00:42.471 --> 00:00:44.270
So I'm just like, you know what? I'll just listen to it while I.

15
00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:49.100
If your belly button was a real button and you could push it once a day to make

16
00:00:49.130 --> 00:00:51.080
anything happen, what would it do?

17
00:00:54.290 --> 00:00:57.770
It would make it rain just for that brief moment. Like every everybody,

18
00:00:58.270 --> 00:01:00.050
$5 bills could come down. I pushed my button, makes it rain.

19
00:01:00.051 --> 00:01:03.770
I pick up the money I'm out for the day. If every time you finish a sex,

20
00:01:03.800 --> 00:01:08.090
a song played, what song would you want it to be juicy by biggie?

21
00:01:09.110 --> 00:01:13.640
Would you rather live in a world where everyone, but you as male or female? Oh,

22
00:01:14.450 --> 00:01:16.490
that's such a tough question.

23
00:01:19.340 --> 00:01:19.610
<v 1>Oh.</v>

24
00:01:19.610 --> 00:01:20.151
<v 0>Geez.</v>

25
00:01:20.151 --> 00:01:25.010
We can't make I say male because I have the possibility of making more females

26
00:01:26.180 --> 00:01:27.320
for the rest of your life.

27
00:01:27.321 --> 00:01:31.910
Would you rather only have sex in one position or only be able to watch one

28
00:01:32.420 --> 00:01:32.870
poured?

29
00:01:32.870 --> 00:01:34.820
<v 1>Oh, that's a horrible question.</v>

30
00:01:35.360 --> 00:01:39.170
<v 0>I am going to say sex in one position because watching one porn would grind me.</v>

31
00:01:40.070 --> 00:01:43.610
Would you rather have ugly shoes or ugly underwear for the rest of your life?

32
00:01:44.540 --> 00:01:49.190
I show them both off, more often than other people. Uh, but underwear,

33
00:01:49.191 --> 00:01:52.310
because I can take them off with my pants at the same time and not have anyone

34
00:01:52.311 --> 00:01:56.660
know I was wearing ugly underwear. Your father and boyfriend switched bodies.

35
00:01:56.870 --> 00:02:00.020
Only way to get them back to normal is to bang. One of them.

36
00:02:00.380 --> 00:02:01.850
Who do you have sex with?

37
00:02:02.720 --> 00:02:04.790
<v 1>So your dad's body with your boyfriend's brain.</v>

38
00:02:05.030 --> 00:02:09.050
Oh my boyfriend's body with your dad's brain. Um.

39
00:02:09.440 --> 00:02:11.690
<v 0>You have to still stick with my boyfriend's body.</v>

40
00:02:11.720 --> 00:02:13.100
I think that makes the most sense.

41
00:02:14.300 --> 00:02:17.420
<v 1>You have sex with your dad's consciousness. It's crazy. He has no brain.</v>

42
00:02:19.130 --> 00:02:22.640
<v 0>You could pick one person from TV movies to be your college roommate.</v>

43
00:02:22.670 --> 00:02:24.350
Who would it be? J-Lo.

44
00:02:25.940 --> 00:02:30.710
<v 1>Oh, really? Yeah. That's an interesting choice. We'd be roomies.</v>

45
00:02:31.010 --> 00:02:32.750
<v 0>We can brush each other's hair.</v>

46
00:02:32.960 --> 00:02:34.080
<v 1>You gets more attention if you go out.</v>

47
00:02:35.660 --> 00:02:38.330
<v 0>Deservedly. So not because of Iran because of her.</v>

48
00:02:38.600 --> 00:02:41.570
How much money would it take for you to not know how to read?

49
00:02:45.290 --> 00:02:45.860
<v 1>Um.</v>

50
00:02:45.860 --> 00:02:47.710
<v 0>Gosh, there's a ton of athletes that can't read a,</v>

51
00:02:47.711 --> 00:02:49.460
I don't think Mike Tyson could read goodie.

52
00:02:50.370 --> 00:02:52.620
There's some guys in the business that I have to fill out their paperwork

53
00:02:52.760 --> 00:02:55.340
because they can't read how much money would it take.

54
00:02:55.370 --> 00:02:59.710
I want to say $5 billion.

55
00:02:59.890 --> 00:03:02.620
Cause then I could pay a lot of people to read to me in texts for me.

56
00:03:02.950 --> 00:03:05.980
That's good. Ooh. Wow. I just got shocked by this.

57
00:03:06.430 --> 00:03:10.420
A pig's orgasm lasts for over 30 minutes. Bless their hearts.

58
00:03:10.540 --> 00:03:11.980
I don't even eat bacon or pork.

59
00:03:12.400 --> 00:03:15.730
A lion can have sex over 50 times per day.

60
00:03:16.420 --> 00:03:18.580
Which would you rather be? Definitely.

61
00:03:18.581 --> 00:03:22.210
I'd rather go 50 times a day because you could easily get 30 minutes of orgasms

62
00:03:22.211 --> 00:03:25.480
in those 50 sessions. Just doing math. Now it's just doing math. I mean,

63
00:03:25.510 --> 00:03:30.400
girls do math. Would you rather have sex with a blind person or a deaf person?

64
00:03:32.230 --> 00:03:33.520
Uh, I have not,

65
00:03:33.550 --> 00:03:36.670
but I am learning sign language and just didn't have my first successful

66
00:03:36.671 --> 00:03:40.090
conversation at trade shows. Very proud. We didn't talk in depth,

67
00:03:40.091 --> 00:03:41.800
but we got to say, hello, how are you? Where are you from?

68
00:03:41.801 --> 00:03:43.450
These are things I'm going to say.

69
00:03:43.451 --> 00:03:46.870
I would rather have sex with blind person because I would not care what I look

70
00:03:46.871 --> 00:03:48.790
like. Yeah.

71
00:03:49.660 --> 00:03:52.150
I wouldn't be flipping my hair over to the side in that position,

72
00:03:52.151 --> 00:03:54.910
making sure he had a good angle. I would just be like, I'm here straight up.

73
00:03:55.360 --> 00:03:58.810
If you entered a beauty pageant, what would your talent be?

74
00:04:01.720 --> 00:04:02.440
<v 1>It is a loaded.</v>

75
00:04:02.440 --> 00:04:05.290
<v 0>Question because a lot of the talents that I have are not allowed in a beauty</v>

76
00:04:05.291 --> 00:04:09.610
contest. Let's say I would do math.

77
00:04:09.970 --> 00:04:13.600
That would be my talent. I would do math. Statistically speaking on baseballs.

78
00:04:14.490 --> 00:04:16.890
<v 1>Did you win that beauty contest? I don't think so.</v>

79
00:04:18.030 --> 00:04:20.190
<v 0>Because there's gonna be a piano player and she's always going to beat me.</v>

80
00:04:20.610 --> 00:04:24.570
Would you rather everybody talk about you behind your back or never talk about

81
00:04:24.571 --> 00:04:29.520
you at all? They say no news is bad news,

82
00:04:29.521 --> 00:04:32.910
right? So I guess talking about me behind my back keeps my name alive.

83
00:04:32.911 --> 00:04:36.840
So I'm going to be happy with the fact that people talk about me behind my back.

84
00:04:37.230 --> 00:04:38.370
When you're drunk.

85
00:04:40.380 --> 00:04:43.260
Is it better to get late or have an ideal drunk feel?

86
00:04:43.290 --> 00:04:46.230
The only time I drink alcohol is to have like hyped up sex.

87
00:04:46.620 --> 00:04:50.130
So the meal does not matter because then I feel guilt over the calories from the

88
00:04:50.131 --> 00:04:52.200
alcohol as well as the calories from the meal.

89
00:04:52.410 --> 00:04:54.270
So I would like to get late drunk. Thank you.

90
00:04:54.600 --> 00:04:59.490
Would you rather have a good hand job from your grandmother or

91
00:04:59.491 --> 00:05:02.120
a bad hand job from your grandma? From your.

92
00:05:02.790 --> 00:05:03.870
<v 1>Oh, so, so it's all great.</v>

93
00:05:03.871 --> 00:05:07.640
So it's would you rather give your grandfather a good hand job or a band head?

94
00:05:08.970 --> 00:05:09.803
Oh my God.

95
00:05:12.810 --> 00:05:14.580
<v 0>The trials and tribulations.</v>

96
00:05:14.600 --> 00:05:18.210
I think I'd want it to be bad because I wouldn't want to give him a good one

97
00:05:18.840 --> 00:05:23.820
rest in peace. My grandfather, yeah. Handjobs are tricky. You know what I mean?

98
00:05:23.880 --> 00:05:25.350
You really got to interview the guy for a couple of minutes.

99
00:05:25.351 --> 00:05:27.930
Like what do you like, like a quick spin. You like it straight up and down?

100
00:05:27.931 --> 00:05:29.820
Like, do you like it wet until I get dry? Like, what's your deal?

101
00:05:30.120 --> 00:05:32.130
When I got hired for a hand drawn movie, I was like,

102
00:05:32.131 --> 00:05:35.670
I don't think I'd give a good hand job. So it's a lot of questions out.

103
00:05:36.150 --> 00:05:37.890
I do them all the time because you do it yourself,

104
00:05:38.160 --> 00:05:41.910
but every guy likes a completely different. Yes. Yeah. You got, I ask,

105
00:05:41.911 --> 00:05:43.980
I ask a series of a couple of questions beforehand.

106
00:05:44.700 --> 00:05:49.260
Would you rather give the first 90% of a blow job or the last

107
00:05:49.261 --> 00:05:51.330
10%? Well,

108
00:05:51.331 --> 00:05:55.380
I'm gonna go with the 10% because that means I'm being pleased for the other 90%

109
00:05:55.381 --> 00:05:56.340
of this exchange.

110
00:05:57.020 --> 00:06:00.920
Who is the one celebrity you would want at your funeral?

111
00:06:00.921 --> 00:06:05.600
That's a great question. Um,

112
00:06:06.680 --> 00:06:08.830
I'm going to say Obama, cause I mean,

113
00:06:08.840 --> 00:06:13.760
doesn't everybody want Obama everywhere wearing that bomber jacket that says 44,

114
00:06:14.240 --> 00:06:17.960
IE, the cool Obama, the Duke game before Xi'an blew out his sneaker, that Obama,

115
00:06:19.130 --> 00:06:23.720
what is the one rumor true or false? You'd want to spread about yourself

116
00:06:26.810 --> 00:06:30.860
That I'm not friendly. And I don't read, Oh, I heard about it.

117
00:06:37.570 --> 00:06:37.860
<v 1>[Inaudible].</v>

118
00:06:37.860 --> 00:06:42.580
<v 0>Or one dog. And I was asked the other day, are you a cat or a dog person?</v>

119
00:06:42.760 --> 00:06:45.050
I'm like, well, I just love all animals. Um,

120
00:06:45.051 --> 00:06:47.650
and I know most people say kittens cause they love dogs,

121
00:06:47.651 --> 00:06:51.790
but I'm going to go one dog because it's only one animal I'm killing as opposed

122
00:06:51.791 --> 00:06:55.780
to 25 animals. Cause I'm seeing them as neutral. They're both living thing,

123
00:06:55.781 --> 00:06:57.100
right? Sorry.

124
00:06:57.220 --> 00:07:00.010
<v 1>You wouldn't have to edit that dog.</v>

125
00:07:02.310 --> 00:07:03.760
Cats are cats and dogs.

126
00:07:04.090 --> 00:07:07.210
<v 0>I know what there's still animals that can adapt the SPCA. Who,</v>

127
00:07:07.211 --> 00:07:08.780
by the way I know right now is running a,

128
00:07:09.010 --> 00:07:10.840
an adoption free fee program right now.

129
00:07:11.260 --> 00:07:16.090
Would you rather have a 10 inch Dick with no balls or a four inch

130
00:07:16.270 --> 00:07:18.940
tip with bowls? Of course, I want to have the big Dick energy.

131
00:07:18.941 --> 00:07:22.810
I want the 10 inch Dick with no balls. Interesting. Just getting aware.

132
00:07:22.811 --> 00:07:25.300
Aren't they uncomfortable manage all day don't they get hot don't you have to

133
00:07:25.301 --> 00:07:26.134
powder them.

134
00:07:27.600 --> 00:07:28.030
<v 1>I.</v>

135
00:07:28.030 --> 00:07:29.020
<v 0>Don't want the extra stuff.</v>

136
00:07:29.021 --> 00:07:33.010
I'd rather just have the tenants just she'll knock that thing. Well, I mean,

137
00:07:33.011 --> 00:07:36.400
I'm not into four inch either, so I have backed.

138
00:07:37.120 --> 00:07:38.200
<v 1>So the balls are just kind of like.</v>

139
00:07:38.410 --> 00:07:42.070
<v 0>Extra, extra. Yeah. You have to learn about the balls as a girl. Like</v>

140
00:07:43.570 --> 00:07:46.600
if there were stats available for every aspect of your life,

141
00:07:47.080 --> 00:07:49.630
what one stat would you want to know?

142
00:07:50.010 --> 00:07:52.990
<v 1>So you die. You go to the Gates of heaven and it's like, I can,</v>

143
00:07:53.260 --> 00:07:56.410
how many people did I have sex with? Or how many times did I,

144
00:07:56.411 --> 00:07:59.380
how many beers did I drank or whatever number about any aspect of it?

145
00:07:59.620 --> 00:08:03.100
<v 0>I would say sexually and not sexually. How many lives did I touch?</v>

146
00:08:05.100 --> 00:08:05.933
<v 1>And which number is high?</v>

147
00:08:06.880 --> 00:08:10.450
<v 0>Uh, definitely just the regular lives. Just friendships like Matt from,</v>

148
00:08:10.480 --> 00:08:12.790
from Oklahoma come loudly.

149
00:08:12.791 --> 00:08:16.780
Every time you fart or fart loudly, every time you come,

150
00:08:17.350 --> 00:08:19.900
I would definitely like to come loudly every time I fart,

151
00:08:19.910 --> 00:08:23.050
because then I would want to fart more because then I'd be coming all the time.

152
00:08:23.051 --> 00:08:24.700
Right. So it'd be like a dual thing. Right.

153
00:08:27.310 --> 00:08:31.990
Would you rather go back in time and hook up with the one who got away slash

154
00:08:32.050 --> 00:08:33.310
your dream boy, right?

155
00:08:33.550 --> 00:08:37.690
Or change your worst loss as a sports fan?

156
00:08:37.691 --> 00:08:41.680
Of course I would like to change my worst loss as a sports fan. I'm a Mets fan.

157
00:08:41.980 --> 00:08:43.600
I'm a Dallas Cowboys fan.

158
00:08:43.780 --> 00:08:46.300
<v 1>What would you, would you then, what loss would you undo?</v>

159
00:08:46.660 --> 00:08:50.410
<v 0>I would undo the bad green Bay call, um, against Dez Bryant.</v>

160
00:08:50.440 --> 00:08:53.740
I think that really emotionally affected him and needed a sports psychologist

161
00:08:53.741 --> 00:08:56.380
immediately, but she didn't do and has been a downward spiral ever since.

162
00:08:56.381 --> 00:08:57.790
So I think that one call.

163
00:08:59.790 --> 00:08:59.790
<v 1>[Inaudible].</v>
