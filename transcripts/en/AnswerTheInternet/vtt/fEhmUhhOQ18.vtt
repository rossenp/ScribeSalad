<v 0>Hi, I'm Ken Jong and I'm here to answer the internet.</v>

2
00:00:10.040 --> 00:00:10.310
<v 1>[Inaudible].</v>

3
00:00:10.310 --> 00:00:14.840
<v 0>Would you rather be filthy rich in 1900 or poor</v>

4
00:00:14.841 --> 00:00:19.040
now? Um, filthy rich in 1900.

5
00:00:19.100 --> 00:00:20.080
So thank you.

6
00:00:21.260 --> 00:00:23.630
<v 1>Geez. Old, no modern technology.</v>

7
00:00:23.630 --> 00:00:25.700
<v 0>I know that you're okay with it. I'm not here to explain.</v>

8
00:00:25.701 --> 00:00:28.850
I'm just here to just give a one word answer or you can't pay me. And I mean,

9
00:00:28.851 --> 00:00:29.684
this is,

10
00:00:31.340 --> 00:00:33.890
would you rather have everyone to naked all the time?

11
00:00:34.310 --> 00:00:35.990
Are everyone closed all the time?

12
00:00:37.670 --> 00:00:41.900
So there's no in between you got it, bro. You got it, bro.

13
00:00:42.380 --> 00:00:47.300
Jesus. Yeah. Spoken like a true scientist. You know what I mean?

14
00:00:47.301 --> 00:00:49.610
There is a world where if everyone's naked all the time,

15
00:00:49.611 --> 00:00:54.380
there would be no stigma of being naked. And then, you know, you can shower,

16
00:00:54.381 --> 00:00:57.140
you can, you know, use the bathroom and do it. Yeah.

17
00:00:57.141 --> 00:01:00.230
So everyone naked all the time. It's, you know, it's just a,

18
00:01:00.620 --> 00:01:05.510
there'll be a world where there would just be no labels, right? Yeah.

19
00:01:06.620 --> 00:01:07.453
Yeah.

20
00:01:10.370 --> 00:01:11.900
<v 1>Cutting that out. Um,</v>

21
00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:15.320
which fictional character would you love to be the out of it?

22
00:01:15.620 --> 00:01:17.170
<v 0>I mean, you're not real, right? I mean,</v>

23
00:01:18.520 --> 00:01:21.620
you're not everyone here at the office calls you nothing but a phony.

24
00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:23.590
So I think it would be.

25
00:01:31.430 --> 00:01:32.263
<v 1>[Inaudible].</v>

26
00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:39.200
<v 0>Hey, I'm sorry. I'm sorry. Can we go back? Hey, I'm sorry. No,</v>

27
00:01:39.201 --> 00:01:43.820
that wasn't called for. I said I was sorry. I'm sorry. I'll change.

28
00:01:44.180 --> 00:01:45.013
I'm sorry.

29
00:01:51.860 --> 00:01:52.693
<v 1>Okay.</v>

30
00:01:58.660 --> 00:01:59.493
Okay.

31
00:01:59.930 --> 00:02:03.020
<v 0>Your mom and girlfriend switched bodies. Huh?</v>

32
00:02:03.530 --> 00:02:07.100
Only way to get them back to normal is to bang one of them.

33
00:02:07.370 --> 00:02:09.050
Who do you have sex with?

34
00:02:14.420 --> 00:02:17.900
I said I was sorry. I just said it was, I mean,

35
00:02:19.490 --> 00:02:23.330
I feel, if I say girlfriend I'll somehow offend my mom. I don't know why.

36
00:02:33.090 --> 00:02:37.940
<v 1>[Inaudible] Hey, sick question. You got a sick response. Oh my God.</v>

37
00:02:38.720 --> 00:02:39.553
My mom would be.

38
00:02:41.360 --> 00:02:43.940
<v 0>Because my mom would somehow bump on that. Now</v>

39
00:02:46.940 --> 00:02:51.110
would you rather always have the hiccups or a headache? That's a great,

40
00:02:51.290 --> 00:02:54.680
I think the hiccups headaches could man, you got a headache constantly.

41
00:02:54.681 --> 00:02:56.990
It's it's yeah, I think it's just too much.

42
00:02:57.080 --> 00:02:59.890
So hiccups saying that headaches.

43
00:03:01.210 --> 00:03:04.750
<v 1>Headaches, headaches are people don't get it.</v>

44
00:03:05.050 --> 00:03:06.580
There's something that people say when they're just like,

45
00:03:06.581 --> 00:03:08.650
they don't feel that great. Oh, I have a headache. He's like, shut up.

46
00:03:09.370 --> 00:03:10.203
You're sending.

47
00:03:11.310 --> 00:03:15.300
<v 0>Yeah. Medically. You couldn't be more wrong. I,</v>

48
00:03:15.301 --> 00:03:19.440
I think headaches are. Yeah, I think uh, yeah, I mean, okay.

49
00:03:20.010 --> 00:03:22.680
What is the fiercest animal? What you think you could take in a fight?

50
00:03:22.740 --> 00:03:23.521
A Honeybadger.

51
00:03:23.521 --> 00:03:27.510
Everybody knows that my family knows that Honeybadger like the fiercest animal.

52
00:03:27.540 --> 00:03:31.890
I mean, you seem like, like, I think I could, I just said that.

53
00:03:31.891 --> 00:03:36.840
What did I stutter? I just said that. I think I could take a Honeybadger. Yeah,

54
00:03:36.900 --> 00:03:40.200
it didn't know. Hey, have honey badgers ever gone to Duke? I mean,

55
00:03:40.201 --> 00:03:43.410
I don't think I'm like a smart man. Did they ever go to med school? None.

56
00:03:43.710 --> 00:03:48.060
I figured out a way. I'm smart and I'm from Hollywood. So I know these things,

57
00:03:48.450 --> 00:03:51.510
