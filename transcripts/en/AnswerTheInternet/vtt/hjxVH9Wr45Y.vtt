00:00:00.810 --> 00:00:05.270
<v 0>All right. Hey, hi, I'm Tom Sigur.</v>

2
00:00:05.280 --> 00:00:06.380
I'm going to answer the internet.

3
00:00:08.240 --> 00:00:09.073
<v 1>Um.</v>

4
00:00:14.210 --> 00:00:18.410
<v 0>All right. If you could have any two people fight and I know rules,</v>

5
00:00:18.411 --> 00:00:22.520
cage match, who would you choose? Um,

6
00:00:23.720 --> 00:00:28.460
would choose like, like Brock Lesnar and, uh,

7
00:00:28.490 --> 00:00:31.700
what was that little gymnast? Simone bile. Yeah.

8
00:00:33.080 --> 00:00:37.400
I used to be funny. a, I should do that answer again.

9
00:00:38.960 --> 00:00:42.710
I would like to see Garth Brooks take on

10
00:00:43.460 --> 00:00:47.360
30 UFC fighters. Cause I know he would murder each and every one of them,

11
00:00:48.230 --> 00:00:49.820
like he has countless fans.

12
00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:56.930
Would you rather throw up every time someone says McDonald's or wear a

13
00:00:56.931 --> 00:01:00.200
fedora for the rest of your life? And if anybody asks about it,

14
00:01:00.201 --> 00:01:03.800
you have to sincerely say, I just liked the way it looks. that.

15
00:01:04.610 --> 00:01:07.550
No way. Every guy that wears a fedora is a piece of.

16
00:01:08.900 --> 00:01:12.890
Starting with Bert Kreischer. He's the worst.

17
00:01:13.430 --> 00:01:16.670
He wears a dumb hat and no shirt on every show.

18
00:01:16.940 --> 00:01:21.740
And is this gonna actually work? Like it's going to for a year,

19
00:01:21.770 --> 00:01:23.720
but like how long can you do your,

20
00:01:23.750 --> 00:01:27.140
I mean the sleeveless shirts already with Larry, like cable, like, come on,

21
00:01:27.170 --> 00:01:28.160
put the, put a shirt on.

22
00:01:28.760 --> 00:01:31.880
If there were stats available for every aspect of your life,

23
00:01:32.360 --> 00:01:36.170
what three stats would you want to see? Dude? You don't want to see any of them.

24
00:01:36.260 --> 00:01:40.640
It's all bad. I mean, what would be the worst stats then?

25
00:01:42.710 --> 00:01:47.420
Like how many salads have I had single digits, man.

26
00:01:49.400 --> 00:01:52.760
Um, how many hours of sleep do I average?

27
00:01:52.761 --> 00:01:57.050
A night single digits. Um, okay.

28
00:01:57.620 --> 00:02:00.530
But less than five, uh,

29
00:02:01.550 --> 00:02:05.180
I would want to see how much water you drank. I drank in a day.

30
00:02:05.181 --> 00:02:08.090
I think it's like, I average probably like three and a half gallons a day.

31
00:02:08.810 --> 00:02:13.730
How many times I've jerked off? It's probably sad. It's yeah.

32
00:02:14.090 --> 00:02:15.950
It's way less than how many times I've had sex.

33
00:02:17.630 --> 00:02:22.160
How many hours I've wasted watching adult video

34
00:02:22.161 --> 00:02:25.550
content. Would you rather live in a world where everyone,

35
00:02:25.551 --> 00:02:29.750
but you is male or female? Everybody else?

36
00:02:30.530 --> 00:02:34.830
Either all male or all female. What do you mean? That is? The world was like,

37
00:02:36.230 --> 00:02:40.100
Oh, everybody is just one gender. You get to stay male. But everybody's,

38
00:02:40.110 --> 00:02:43.910
you know, everybody's mail. I mean,

39
00:02:45.290 --> 00:02:50.240
I'd take it for a ride. Sure. Like if everybody's female, they have one option,

40
00:02:52.010 --> 00:02:56.750
right? Yeah. Might as well get in there. See what? You can do logic.

41
00:02:57.530 --> 00:03:00.970
And then like what about what I reproduce? They all gonna be? Yeah.

42
00:03:01.300 --> 00:03:03.340
They're all gonna come out. Female too. Yeah.

43
00:03:03.700 --> 00:03:07.990
I can just leave because there's so many, right. You could just be like,

44
00:03:08.330 --> 00:03:11.980
like leave, like it'd be like Viking village where you're just like.

45
00:03:13.090 --> 00:03:18.090
And then be like, I gotta go and you just leave. Yeah. I don't know.

46
00:03:19.750 --> 00:03:22.050
Wouldn't you do that? Wait, what would you do? Hey, nah,

47
00:03:22.230 --> 00:03:25.800
I wish the world was all guys. And then I would be in a fight.

48
00:03:26.070 --> 00:03:30.810
Like I can't wait to have the beat out of me by a world of men. No, that.

49
00:03:31.950 --> 00:03:36.660
How much money would it take for you to not know how? Uh,

50
00:03:37.050 --> 00:03:41.850
a hundred million. Okay, good. I mean, I would just be like,

51
00:03:42.090 --> 00:03:45.600
okay, you read this right. I have a hundred million dollars.

52
00:03:46.020 --> 00:03:50.040
Here's a thousand dollars. Read this to me. Right?

53
00:03:50.760 --> 00:03:53.580
You can't use Twitter. You can't text. Hey, you know how I pay?

54
00:03:53.581 --> 00:03:57.710
You start writing. Isn't that the, yeah, but I,

55
00:03:57.711 --> 00:04:00.450
I think you would need more than that though. More than a hundred million.

56
00:04:00.800 --> 00:04:03.270
If you're going to have to pay someone every single time they need to read for

57
00:04:03.271 --> 00:04:06.360
you. I'll put you on salary. Jesus Christ. Don't you,

58
00:04:07.470 --> 00:04:11.700
you have interns here. I know you guys want to be my reader.

59
00:04:13.770 --> 00:04:15.750
Like you can come with me. Cool places,

60
00:04:15.751 --> 00:04:20.610
get the out of this building and then just reach it. And I'll be like,

61
00:04:20.640 --> 00:04:22.800
Hey, thanks for reading that. Here's a sandwich

62
00:04:25.080 --> 00:04:27.390
you've been put in charge of running. Heck

63
00:04:29.550 --> 00:04:32.610
the afterlife for people not evil enough for hell.

64
00:04:33.420 --> 00:04:36.330
What's the first torture you design.

65
00:04:37.380 --> 00:04:42.120
Oh yeah. It's just, I just have them wait in a lot of lines. You know,

66
00:04:42.750 --> 00:04:45.810
like lines are kind of the worst thing and you know what I would have,

67
00:04:46.110 --> 00:04:47.250
I would make it so that the,

68
00:04:47.300 --> 00:04:51.420
the waiting line that they're in has a bunch of other people having public

69
00:04:51.450 --> 00:04:53.460
speaker phone and FaceTime conversations.

70
00:04:53.880 --> 00:04:56.580
So they're just sitting there and they're like, well, everyone shut the other.

71
00:04:56.730 --> 00:04:58.470
One's like, no, we gotta keep talking. So like,

72
00:04:58.471 --> 00:05:01.350
it's just like just makes them crazy that everyone would shut up.

73
00:05:01.830 --> 00:05:04.320
It might be reserved for help. That's harsh. Perhaps.

74
00:05:04.710 --> 00:05:06.510
That's that's what Garth Brooks is going to suffer one day.

75
00:05:07.440 --> 00:05:11.640
If your belly button was a real button and you could push it once a day to make

76
00:05:11.641 --> 00:05:14.520
anything happen, what would it do right now?

77
00:05:14.521 --> 00:05:18.300
It kind of works as a fart machine. Is that not an option?

78
00:05:19.710 --> 00:05:20.543
Um,

79
00:05:22.350 --> 00:05:25.200
I could make it do anything.

80
00:05:27.960 --> 00:05:30.870
I mean, quarters are always nice to have, you know,

81
00:05:31.560 --> 00:05:34.350
like if you go like this and he's like on the quarter comes out. Yeah.

82
00:05:36.780 --> 00:05:40.500
25 cents a day. I mean, I'm always looking for quarters, dude.

83
00:05:41.280 --> 00:05:45.060
At least like more than $1 is worth six quarters come out.

84
00:05:46.530 --> 00:05:49.710
I got like this and in six quarters I vomit six quarters.

85
00:05:50.340 --> 00:05:54.900
Would you rather walk in on your dad having sex with a dog or a

86
00:05:54.901 --> 00:05:57.830
dog having sex with your dad? Jesus.

87
00:05:58.460 --> 00:05:59.293
<v 2>Christ.</v>

88
00:06:01.090 --> 00:06:04.480
<v 0>Um, I'd rather, I think I'd rather see my dad a dog,</v>

89
00:06:05.680 --> 00:06:09.550
you know, than to see a dog mounting. My dad, like,

90
00:06:09.700 --> 00:06:14.410
and my dad kind of look up with that like, like, Hey buddy.

91
00:06:14.470 --> 00:06:19.450
And I'll be like, who are you talking to? You know, like if he the dog,

92
00:06:19.480 --> 00:06:23.620
I'd be like, yeah, we all got our thing, you know? Right.

93
00:06:24.280 --> 00:06:29.170
You're like dad loves to come to. Right. Would you rather,

94
00:06:29.171 --> 00:06:30.340
every time you come,

95
00:06:30.460 --> 00:06:34.990
it comes out of your mouth or it's two liter bottles worth. I got to tell you,

96
00:06:35.290 --> 00:06:39.070
I already do about two liter bottles with I buckets.

97
00:06:39.460 --> 00:06:44.380
It is absolutely revolting and exciting to whoever's on the other side of

98
00:06:44.381 --> 00:06:47.980
it. Like I, it's not an impressive piece of equipment,

99
00:06:48.250 --> 00:06:49.930
but if you want to see a lot of GEs,

100
00:06:52.690 --> 00:06:56.950
any interns, thank you very much.
