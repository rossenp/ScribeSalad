00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:04.080
<v 0>What's up guys. I'm Brendan sharp from the fighter and the kid and Showtime.</v>

00:00:05.020 --> 00:00:05.853
<v 1>Um.</v>

00:00:12.410 --> 00:00:15.290
<v 0>$4 Billion to be on catch-up editor.</v>

4
00:00:20.030 --> 00:00:24.410
Would you rather lose the sensitivity flavor of your taste buds or lose a

5
00:00:24.860 --> 00:00:28.430
sensitive feeling of sex? Oh,

6
00:00:28.490 --> 00:00:32.300
I'll go with, you know, I'm getting a little older. I'd go with sex. You know,

7
00:00:32.301 --> 00:00:36.860
I love food. I love pizza. I'm getting a tad older.

8
00:00:36.990 --> 00:00:39.140
It would calm me down. If I didn't care about sex,

9
00:00:39.320 --> 00:00:43.730
probably be more focused in life. I'll take the, uh, the sex. Yeah,

10
00:00:43.820 --> 00:00:47.060
definitely a second. Who is the one president you'd want to get faced with?

11
00:00:47.090 --> 00:00:48.800
This is easy pill, Clinton,

12
00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:52.550
that old scallywag he's a good time, man.

13
00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:56.390
Him Monica Lewinsky. I want him to how he cheated on his girl.

14
00:00:57.680 --> 00:01:02.000
Non-stop as the president of United States and just slapping, uh, bill Clinton,

15
00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:08.180
would you rather have a good hand job from your grandma? Good God guys.

16
00:01:08.540 --> 00:01:10.790
Or a bad hand job from your grandmother?

17
00:01:15.410 --> 00:01:20.210
A bad one. Obviously you don't want it. Good.

18
00:01:20.510 --> 00:01:23.600
Cause you want to be thinking about it the next week. You want to be like, ah,

19
00:01:23.601 --> 00:01:26.750

20
00:01:27.470 --> 00:01:28.910
These are now I'm scared to read this.

21
00:01:29.360 --> 00:01:32.480
Would you rather have your porn search history shared with all your Twitter

22
00:01:32.481 --> 00:01:36.320
followers or your parents' Twitter followers? Because they're dirt bags like me.

23
00:01:36.470 --> 00:01:39.650
They're like, Oh dude, you think that's hot? Check this out.

24
00:01:39.830 --> 00:01:42.710
That would be the best. My parents would judge the out of me.

25
00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:44.990
My Twitter followers would love me even more for it.

26
00:01:46.130 --> 00:01:49.760
If you were a war general in the civil war and you got the choice of bringing a

27
00:01:49.761 --> 00:01:54.170
T-Rex or more, uh, modern war tank on your side, what are you taking?

28
00:01:55.430 --> 00:01:59.090
Is it, is it during the civil war? Well, I thought it was today. I was like,

29
00:01:59.091 --> 00:02:03.680
today I'm taking a drone, just civil war that T-Rex just like, ah,

30
00:02:03.930 --> 00:02:05.600
it's like killing everyone. And then like,

31
00:02:05.870 --> 00:02:09.470
and then all the guys are putting muskets like, Oh. Yeah.

32
00:02:09.471 --> 00:02:11.240
I'll take the T-Rex now. I thought at the time,

00:02:11.250 --> 00:02:16.070
current day I'd blow the shut thing today. He's laughing. It's just not good.

37
00:02:32.720 --> 00:02:35.990
Nah, man. No, I don't need the cash that bad. I'm good, man.

38
00:02:35.991 --> 00:02:38.990
I don't need that reputation that your whole game would be killed.

39
00:02:38.991 --> 00:02:43.370
There's no jobs. There's nothing. No, I will not take four mil. No, no,

40
00:02:43.371 --> 00:02:45.230
not take 4 million VX. That's your predator.

44
00:02:51.350 --> 00:02:56.090
You want to sit down like for one he's like, he's like we got here.

00:02:56.750 --> 00:03:01.570
Uh, you said you want to lick his he's 14. I don't want that. And you have,

Uh, I'd have to ride off the sunset. Never be seen again.

48
00:03:10.600 --> 00:03:11.620
I'll say a hundred mil.

49
00:03:11.890 --> 00:03:13.180
