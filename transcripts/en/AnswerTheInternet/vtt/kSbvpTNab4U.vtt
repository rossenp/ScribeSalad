Have you seen this stop porn stop. It's called stop porn.

26
00:01:51.320 --> 00:01:54.830
It's a Japanese guy who has the power to freeze time.

27
00:01:55.190 --> 00:01:59.690
So he's in an office building and he goes like, uh, uh,

28
00:01:59.840 --> 00:02:01.880
magic Japanese word. Right. And then,

29
00:02:02.090 --> 00:02:05.630
and then everyone just freezes and he just goes around and molests them as

30
00:02:05.631 --> 00:02:09.530
they're frozen, but they're not frozen. They're actresses just going like this.

31
00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:13.130
And he's just like, I can't do the Japanese accent. So I'll just be like,

32
00:02:13.131 --> 00:02:16.730
he's like all top of the mountain until you this.

33
00:02:21.440 --> 00:02:24.500
And then everyone's got come all over him. And he goes, I stopped,

00:02:24.920 --> 00:02:26.960
stopped pulling. And everyone's like, why am I covered in

35
00:02:28.580 --> 00:02:31.820
there's no creepiest. He like took one girl in later down,

36
00:02:31.821 --> 00:02:32.810
but her legs stayed up.

37
00:02:32.811 --> 00:02:37.790
Like this dude is who jacks off to that. This guy,

38
00:02:39.080 --> 00:02:43.010
would you bang your cousin to win Powerball? The answer is a hot. Yes.

39
00:02:43.550 --> 00:02:47.450
And my cousin Abe would be into it. He'd be like, how much are we winning?

40
00:02:48.110 --> 00:02:52.430
We gotta do this. Cause all right, here we go. My cousin Abe.

41
00:02:52.431 --> 00:02:55.910
One time we were in a, this is the way his brain works. One time we're in a,

42
00:02:56.120 --> 00:03:00.970
in a train and the door's broken. It's just going. I am pant every time corner.

43
00:03:00.971 --> 00:03:03.850
And he goes, how much do you think they give me?

44
00:03:04.330 --> 00:03:06.100
If my arm was there and it got broken?

45
00:03:06.101 --> 00:03:09.040
How much do you think I get for the train stations? I don't, I don't know.

46
00:03:09.041 --> 00:03:12.490
He goes, think a million bucks. I said, Oh no. And he goes, let's find out.

47
00:03:12.730 --> 00:03:15.890
And I go, you're going to break your hand right now. And he was like, yeah,

48
00:03:16.200 --> 00:03:18.910
right. Not, I go, hold on. We're going to a Dave Matthews concert. Like,

49
00:03:18.940 --> 00:03:21.220
I don't want you to have a broken hand. And he was like,

50
00:03:21.490 --> 00:03:25.330
good call and just walked away. At one time, he goes, he comes in, he comes in,

51
00:03:25.360 --> 00:03:28.030
we were having beers at this turf club betting on horses.

52
00:03:28.180 --> 00:03:31.540
And he comes in and he goes, anyone want a Prozac? And we're like, you're,

53
00:03:31.550 --> 00:03:34.180
you're on Prozac. And he goes, yeah, I go, I didn't know. You were depressed.

54
00:03:34.181 --> 00:03:37.000
He goes, I'm not. I go, why are you on Prozac? He goes,

55
00:03:37.060 --> 00:03:41.160
who couldn't stand to do a little bit better. Huh? So yeah, it would be a,

56
00:03:44.130 --> 00:03:47.280
and I get myself worked up and then finishing them, like,

57
00:03:47.430 --> 00:03:51.770
I'd be the starting pitcher and he'd just be, the clothes are just, Oh,

58
00:03:51.810 --> 00:03:54.330
I just have to him. Oh, you just got to him a little bit.

59
00:03:54.331 --> 00:03:57.360
And then I can fit in a nicer place in his

60
00:04:00.660 --> 00:04:04.650
anyway. Okay. That's a better question. All right. What would you rather do?

61
00:04:05.070 --> 00:04:07.950
What would you rather start a blow job pitch nine innings,

62
00:04:08.010 --> 00:04:12.060
or just be the closer and catch the load? I

63
00:04:13.760 --> 00:04:16.110
can't believe you're taking time on this. I'm catching loads.

64
00:04:17.100 --> 00:04:19.170
I'm going to be like Lucy and the chocolate factory. Like

65
00:04:21.720 --> 00:04:25.710
what are you doing? You can't think about swallowing.

66
00:04:27.210 --> 00:04:28.830
You can't think about swallowing gum. He's got it.

67
00:04:28.831 --> 00:04:32.160
He's got a little pit stomach. Is he throwing up?

68
00:04:33.780 --> 00:04:34.830
Oh, I got to do it just a little.

69
00:04:35.670 --> 00:04:37.980
My daughters are going to find this one day on the internet. Like, Oh,

70
00:04:37.981 --> 00:04:39.090
I miss dad. Let me see that.

71
00:04:39.450 --> 00:04:42.810
What catching loads in the mouth he's going to finish and cut uncle Abe.

72
00:04:44.160 --> 00:04:48.480
Would you rather be the best looking dude in the world or be able to read minds?

73
00:04:49.530 --> 00:04:53.130
Wow. Okay. Let's let's think this out. That's what you can do in the world.

74
00:04:53.190 --> 00:04:56.220
It's gotta be nice. You can everyone. Everyone wants to give everything.

75
00:04:56.470 --> 00:04:58.980
Everyone smiles. When they see you, as opposed to being ugly. When they see you,

76
00:04:58.981 --> 00:05:03.480
they're like, can I help you, sir? As opposed to, Hey, can we to help you?

77
00:05:03.630 --> 00:05:05.940
But if you read minds and you're just a regular person,

78
00:05:06.150 --> 00:05:10.590
that's gotta be so painful all day that like, look at this fat. Oh,

79
00:05:10.890 --> 00:05:13.260
I'm sure he's going to fart. I'm moving trains.

80
00:05:15.840 --> 00:05:18.750
And then you'll be like, I would, I'd probably that guy. If I was drunk enough,

81
00:05:20.220 --> 00:05:21.630
can you imagine his wife has, I mean,

82
00:05:21.631 --> 00:05:24.690
imagine all this people would think about you. I'm going,

83
00:05:24.720 --> 00:05:25.650
that's what you can do in the world.

84
00:05:25.710 --> 00:05:28.950
I would love to see what it's like to like approach a stranger and have them

85
00:05:28.951 --> 00:05:33.240
smile immediately and be like, Hey, nice.

86
00:05:33.300 --> 00:05:34.710
You're not threatening at all. Yeah.

87
00:05:34.711 --> 00:05:37.350
And then I'd have the guy that reads mine's next to me and goes, by the way,

88
00:05:37.380 --> 00:05:40.560
she wants you to finger her. I don't even know her.

89
00:05:40.561 --> 00:05:44.910
And the coronavirus is going around. I know just all the I think about myself.

90
00:05:44.911 --> 00:05:49.530
I just hear other people verbalize it. Confirmed. Yeah. He's wearing God,

91
00:05:50.490 --> 00:05:52.060
God, I can't believe you've performed with his shirt off.

92
00:05:52.170 --> 00:05:55.110
Cause he told him his jeans story. Again, you get on stage. And they're like,

93
00:05:55.800 --> 00:05:58.760
I was second that ladies and gentlemen Chrysler and I come out. They're like,

94
00:05:58.970 --> 00:06:02.060
yeah. And all I hear is, Oh my God, he's gained weight. He's so bad.

95
00:06:02.061 --> 00:06:04.370
I think his flight is going to go down. He's so fat.

96
00:06:04.490 --> 00:06:06.590
As blinds are going to hold this long as a holding,

97
00:06:07.160 --> 00:06:11.240
would you rather be drunk 24, seven or never be drunk again?

98
00:06:14.030 --> 00:06:17.630
So if you're never drinking again, you miss out on sunsets

99
00:06:19.190 --> 00:06:23.360
mornings in the airport. Uh, your dad's funeral,

100
00:06:27.860 --> 00:06:32.540
every St. Patrick's day. Every time your wife says,

101
00:06:32.750 --> 00:06:34.940
Hey, you want to put a bottle of wine and your heart skips a beat.

102
00:06:34.941 --> 00:06:36.500
And you're like, it's exactly what I want.

103
00:06:37.310 --> 00:06:40.970
You never get any of those now flip side, you feel fantastic.

104
00:06:41.750 --> 00:06:44.330
Lose weight. You lose weight. You look good. You live longer.

105
00:06:44.710 --> 00:06:47.530
<v 2>Probably have more of a more successful career wherever you work,</v>

106
00:06:47.531 --> 00:06:48.364
wherever you do.

107
00:06:48.850 --> 00:06:52.000
<v 0>But you've got to sit on a,</v>

108
00:06:52.510 --> 00:06:55.090
on a bar, on a dock,

109
00:06:55.630 --> 00:07:00.340
watch a sunset and have a diet Coke or like a seltzer. That's the worst.

110
00:07:00.490 --> 00:07:04.210
Can I get a seltzer water and put a little splash of grenadine in there?

111
00:07:06.700 --> 00:07:09.880
No, I know, right? By the way,

112
00:07:09.881 --> 00:07:13.150
this is why I would never go into rehab is because I'm like,

113
00:07:13.480 --> 00:07:15.340
that would be the guy going guys, guys, guys, guys, guys, guys.

114
00:07:15.820 --> 00:07:19.000
We never get to see like a movie we haven't seen in a while and then go it.

115
00:07:19.001 --> 00:07:20.650
I'm gonna get hammered for this like guy.

116
00:07:22.360 --> 00:07:22.960
<v 2>We sure.</v>

117
00:07:22.960 --> 00:07:24.880
<v 0>Guys, we served guys. This is, I mean,</v>

118
00:07:25.180 --> 00:07:27.010
I'm hearing a lot of forever talk around here

119
00:07:29.440 --> 00:07:30.910
or be drunk 24 hours a day.

120
00:07:30.911 --> 00:07:33.250
Now here's the problem with being drunk 24 hours a day.

121
00:07:33.340 --> 00:07:36.880
How drunk are we talking? Are we talking manageable? Are we talking about.

122
00:07:36.890 --> 00:07:39.850
<v 2>They uh, like could get a DUI, like, you know?</v>

123
00:07:40.210 --> 00:07:42.520
<v 0>Okay, well I don't drive already. So we're we're by the way,</v>

124
00:07:42.610 --> 00:07:45.340
a lot of this is already going to fit into lifestyle. I've set up for myself.

125
00:07:45.580 --> 00:07:47.890
You're going to go. Yeah. You can take Uber everywhere. Got it.

126
00:07:48.100 --> 00:07:51.460
Living in a tour bus. Got it. Got it. Don't have a regular job. Got it. Got it.

127
00:07:51.461 --> 00:07:53.680
Got it. Got it. You're going to gain weight. Been there, done that.

128
00:07:53.681 --> 00:07:57.730
Doing it currently. Yeah. I would probably say, uh,

129
00:07:57.970 --> 00:08:02.230
the problem is I get tired of alcohol at times where I'm like, where I'm like,

130
00:08:02.500 --> 00:08:06.100
God, I need a break. Oh, can we smoke weed?

131
00:08:07.060 --> 00:08:07.571
<v 2>Yeah.</v>

132
00:08:07.571 --> 00:08:10.900
Let's I'll give you that loophole so you can get you just can't because yeah,

133
00:08:10.901 --> 00:08:12.730
you can do other things. You just can't be drunk. Oh,

134
00:08:12.850 --> 00:08:15.130
I can do other things like you go to your kid's event or something that has a

135
00:08:15.370 --> 00:08:19.330
face. Dad, you can't, you know, I never thought of this as faced,

136
00:08:20.650 --> 00:08:23.650
not shopping drinks as a valuable review where you'd be like, totally fine.

137
00:08:23.860 --> 00:08:24.693
No one would even know.

138
00:08:25.810 --> 00:08:30.640
<v 0>Five, 10. Yeah. I could.</v>

139
00:08:30.670 --> 00:08:33.160
I could have, I could have, uh, I could have,

140
00:08:33.730 --> 00:08:37.870
I had five beers yesterday morning and then not only did I not even feel it,

141
00:08:38.110 --> 00:08:42.100
but it was aggravating. So like, I would hate to be that for 24 hours a day.

142
00:08:42.101 --> 00:08:45.280
Like just how many of these is, are going to make it happen? Um,

143
00:08:45.310 --> 00:08:50.260
I could probably have a sizable amount of alcohol show up to an event and no one

144
00:08:50.261 --> 00:08:54.850
would know no one would know. And I, by the way, I've done that.

145
00:08:54.990 --> 00:08:59.370
No one knew. And then my, my wife won't even know, like she couldn't even know.

146
00:08:59.610 --> 00:09:02.370
So I brought it up to the 24, seven drunk, 24, seven drunk,

147
00:09:02.371 --> 00:09:04.050
and then just continue on the path I'm on.

148
00:09:05.960 --> 00:09:06.793
<v 2>Yeah. She's worked out.</v>

149
00:09:07.890 --> 00:09:11.840
<v 0>You rather date a girl who constantly sneezes on you or constantly farts during</v>

150
00:09:11.841 --> 00:09:12.674
sex

151
00:09:20.670 --> 00:09:25.130
Constantly needed for the fun you. So anytime you're like, Hey, this is my wife.

152
00:09:26.550 --> 00:09:30.560
You're like, God it. Nevermind. Or as you're or says,

153
00:09:37.430 --> 00:09:38.900
I'm going to go forwarding. I'm going to go forwarding.

154
00:09:38.910 --> 00:09:41.690
My wife had the door and oral sex one time and it didn't bother me.

155
00:09:41.870 --> 00:09:44.720
It didn't bother me at all because I knew at least she's having an orgasm.

156
00:09:48.140 --> 00:09:51.080
And I was like, that's it bring it home. Big guy.

157
00:09:52.850 --> 00:09:56.420
talk about confirmation. We got the DNA.

158
00:09:56.540 --> 00:10:00.170
We got all the swabs from the cheek and everything that happened.

159
00:10:00.500 --> 00:10:05.480
That's an orgasm. When she almost on your chin, that's a orgasm.

160
00:10:05.810 --> 00:10:07.400
That is a good orgasm.

161
00:10:10.670 --> 00:10:14.000
You're like, ah, ah, you could have in my mouth.

162
00:10:15.440 --> 00:10:17.600
give me a heads up. Firing the hole.

163
00:10:18.320 --> 00:10:20.930
What movie most recently made you cry?

164
00:10:23.990 --> 00:10:24.010
Uh,

165
00:10:24.010 --> 00:10:27.500
there's a movie that has made me cry more than any movie in the entire world.

166
00:10:27.560 --> 00:10:31.100
And you're going to go. Are you serious time? Traveler's wife.

167
00:10:31.820 --> 00:10:32.653
Have you ever seen this?

168
00:10:32.750 --> 00:10:36.770
<v 2>No. I know the premise side dude.</v>

169
00:10:37.970 --> 00:10:42.650
<v 0>There's a time Traveler's wife and the reason I'm in a bed, I'm in a hotel room.</v>

170
00:10:42.800 --> 00:10:45.770
I get out of the shower. It's on TB and I just I'm out of the shower.

171
00:10:45.771 --> 00:10:47.570
I'm on the corner of the bed and I'm just watching.

172
00:10:47.810 --> 00:10:50.480
And I'm seeing him feeling connections with this guy. Eric Bennett plays.

173
00:10:50.660 --> 00:10:52.940
He's a guy who time travels by the way, I'm obsessed with time, trouble.

174
00:10:53.090 --> 00:10:56.270
I'm really obsessed with time travel. He time travels more importantly,

175
00:10:56.450 --> 00:11:00.230
he in order to stop traveling, time traveling, he drinks. So he drinks.

176
00:11:00.231 --> 00:11:04.280
So he doesn't time travel. Right? So there we go. So I drink a lot,

177
00:11:04.281 --> 00:11:08.060
but I go on the road. I time travel. And when he wakes up, he's totally naked.

178
00:11:08.061 --> 00:11:10.040
That's happened to me a lot. Okay.

179
00:11:10.460 --> 00:11:14.240
And at the end he finds out his daughter can time travel and his head of the

180
00:11:14.241 --> 00:11:15.800
daughter and then he dies.

181
00:11:15.830 --> 00:11:20.360
But he can still time travel into their lives from other points

182
00:11:20.720 --> 00:11:25.400
in his life that he's leading in the past. So he's dead, right?

183
00:11:25.760 --> 00:11:29.090
Oh my God. I'm getting chill, bumps. He's dead. And he comes out of the woods,

184
00:11:29.091 --> 00:11:30.500
the same woods where he met his wife.

185
00:11:30.680 --> 00:11:35.150
He comes out of the woods and his daughter goes daddy. And he's like, w what,

186
00:11:35.210 --> 00:11:38.960
what time is it? What's going on? And she starts telling me, she goes, mommy,

187
00:11:39.050 --> 00:11:41.870
he's here. And then the mom drops everything and starts running.

188
00:11:41.990 --> 00:11:46.160
And all I can visualize is just like the you're on the road a lot as a dad.

189
00:11:46.161 --> 00:11:47.720
And you're always busting your.

190
00:11:47.960 --> 00:11:51.050
And then you do come home and your kids are like daddy. And you're like, Hey.

191
00:11:51.051 --> 00:11:53.060
And you're like, wait, I've got to go. I've got to Tuesday,

192
00:11:53.260 --> 00:11:57.430
got to get back out to Huntsville. Oh, hold on, hold on. Oh my God. I'm sobbing,

193
00:11:57.431 --> 00:11:59.650
crying on the corner of a bed. Just my wife.

194
00:12:04.290 --> 00:12:07.050
[inaudible] time. Traveler's wife.

195
00:12:07.410 --> 00:12:10.410
I can't cry around movies with my daughters anymore because they call me out on

196
00:12:10.411 --> 00:12:13.590
it. So like, if I start crying, they're like, Hey, someone's crying.

197
00:12:14.040 --> 00:12:16.740
And I'm like, Hey, funny. I came in one time,

198
00:12:16.890 --> 00:12:20.400
I was on the treadmill and I got a phone call that was pretty bad. I was crying.

199
00:12:20.430 --> 00:12:24.420
And I walked in and they're like, Hey, dad's crying, mom. And my wife's like,

200
00:12:24.540 --> 00:12:27.510
honey, dad's crying. We're all about to be crying in about five seconds.

201
00:12:28.500 --> 00:12:30.990
And then I was like, they want us to put our dog down. And they're like, what?

202
00:12:30.991 --> 00:12:32.250
It was like, that's how funny more you mother.

203
00:12:34.620 --> 00:12:36.690
If you had the chance to the perfect girl,

204
00:12:36.870 --> 00:12:41.120
but you had to do it with your entire family in the room watching what'd you do

205
00:12:41.200 --> 00:12:44.400
well, the perfect girl is my wife and I would never do that.

206
00:12:45.090 --> 00:12:48.950
But now we're talking like daughters, like your father.

207
00:12:49.530 --> 00:12:54.330
He keeps the daughters in. This is what I can do.

208
00:12:56.280 --> 00:12:59.160
What do you think about this? I run his family.

209
00:12:59.640 --> 00:13:02.790
He's got the big [inaudible] uh,

210
00:13:05.250 --> 00:13:09.200
perfect girl. Perfect girls like Kate up dinner or something. Oh no,

211
00:13:09.210 --> 00:13:12.390
I don't know. We always say that. It's easy to think of the perfect guy.

212
00:13:12.760 --> 00:13:16.140
It's so much easier to think of the perfect guy. There's so much option.

213
00:13:17.130 --> 00:13:18.810
No problem. I was like, anyway, a woman

214
00:13:21.420 --> 00:13:25.920
like Susan Surandon, Barbara Streisand,

215
00:13:25.950 --> 00:13:29.190
Barbara Streisand, and uh,

216
00:13:29.340 --> 00:13:31.020
Rita Moreno.

217
00:13:32.670 --> 00:13:36.030
I think I would rather Danny DeVito in front of my family. Just,

218
00:13:36.180 --> 00:13:40.890
I think they would just get a kick out of you'd be like, Oh gosh, shut up.

219
00:13:41.580 --> 00:13:45.780
So Danny DeVito and like, what was he taking his pants off dad with the Holy.

220
00:13:46.230 --> 00:13:50.730
That's [inaudible] get the out of here. I think he likes it.

221
00:13:50.910 --> 00:13:55.710
They both like it. Oh, wow. Yeah,

222
00:13:55.980 --> 00:13:59.310
Danny. It is. I can definitely Taylor Swift in front of my whole family.

223
00:13:59.311 --> 00:14:03.720
And they'd be like, Oh my God, dad knows Taylor Swift police said, dad, his mom,

224
00:14:03.721 --> 00:14:06.540
mom, mom, don't say a, you're going to this up for all of us. Okay.

225
00:14:07.110 --> 00:14:11.130
If you just can, if there were,

226
00:14:11.370 --> 00:14:14.370
if there was stats available for every aspect of your life,

227
00:14:14.820 --> 00:14:16.920
what one stat would you want to see?

228
00:14:18.930 --> 00:14:22.500
I had a dream the other day that, uh,

229
00:14:22.620 --> 00:14:23.940
I dreamed very vividly that I,

230
00:14:23.970 --> 00:14:27.930
we were at our new house and a truck pulled up and they dump truck,

231
00:14:27.990 --> 00:14:32.460
dumped all of these bottles onto our front yard. And they're like,

232
00:14:32.490 --> 00:14:36.390
this is all the alcohol you drank in your entire life.

233
00:14:36.391 --> 00:14:39.900
And it was like a huge mound. And I was like, are you serious? And I'm like,

234
00:14:39.930 --> 00:14:44.190
Oh no, no, I'm sorry. That's your wife's yours is coming. And I was like, ah,

235
00:14:45.120 --> 00:14:48.930
I constantly say, I would love to know stats. I would love to know stats.

236
00:14:50.400 --> 00:14:53.120
It's so funny. I don't even need to know stats about like,

237
00:14:53.480 --> 00:14:56.600
I was just talking about this as a TV show the other day. Wasn't I like,

238
00:14:56.630 --> 00:15:00.110
I want to know stats on like, um, like States.

239
00:15:00.650 --> 00:15:03.050
I want to know stats about like, uh, uh,

240
00:15:03.080 --> 00:15:05.120
this is how many people own guns in this state.

241
00:15:05.120 --> 00:15:07.340
This is how many people do drugs in this state. Like,

242
00:15:07.341 --> 00:15:10.760
I would love to know stats about everything stats about my personal life.

243
00:15:12.770 --> 00:15:15.200
It would be cool. If you could tell, they can tell you how many you've taken,

244
00:15:15.590 --> 00:15:17.690
but like that you could do some, be a game show.

245
00:15:17.780 --> 00:15:20.180
So you'd get up there and they'd be like, all right, Burt, Kriser's here.

246
00:15:20.300 --> 00:15:21.710
We're going to start off super easy burden.

247
00:15:21.830 --> 00:15:24.800
How many times do you think you bourbon a day? And you're like, I don't know,

248
00:15:24.801 --> 00:15:29.510
like three or four and they're like 19 and you're like, shut the up cigarette.

249
00:15:29.511 --> 00:15:31.160
I went to the car one time. He goes, he said, he goes,

250
00:15:31.310 --> 00:15:33.770
how many times do you think you burp in a day? And I went, I don't know,

251
00:15:33.771 --> 00:15:38.030
like twice. He goes, you burped 20 times in the last 15 minutes. And I went,

252
00:15:38.031 --> 00:15:41.210
are you serious? He goes, you burp a lot. Like, I'm noticing it a lot.

253
00:15:41.300 --> 00:15:44.540
And then I started going, God it. I had to burp a lot, like in, that'd be cool.

254
00:15:44.541 --> 00:15:46.130
And they'd be like, all right, Burt,

255
00:15:46.730 --> 00:15:50.300
how many orgasms have you had by yourself? And you're like,

256
00:15:52.460 --> 00:15:56.510
I'm going to say, what would you say? Maybe 10,000.

257
00:15:57.320 --> 00:15:59.570
Let's do. Let's do real quick. How many days?

258
00:16:00.440 --> 00:16:04.070
How many days in 30 years, how many days were there in

259
00:16:06.530 --> 00:16:09.110
easy rain, man? How did you pull that? How did you pull that up?

260
00:16:10.060 --> 00:16:11.890
<v 2>What has it been a number of days in a year, times three.</v>

261
00:16:12.010 --> 00:16:16.210
That's about a thousand. That's three years. Sometimes 10 is about 30, so,

262
00:16:16.350 --> 00:16:17.770
so easy numbers. And we still.

263
00:16:18.130 --> 00:16:20.290
<v 0>By the way, I still, I still don't know what math I'm doing.</v>

264
00:16:20.620 --> 00:16:23.350
I'm doing one I'm pretty much a one a day kind of guy.

265
00:16:23.550 --> 00:16:26.800
<v 2>That's uh, so for 10 years that'd be 3,650.</v>

266
00:16:28.090 --> 00:16:29.920
<v 0>For 10 years is 3,650.</v>

267
00:16:30.190 --> 00:16:32.320
<v 2>Once a day, three 65 times 10.</v>

268
00:16:34.960 --> 00:16:38.320
<v 0>So I probably jerked off maybe like 10,000 times,</v>

269
00:16:39.820 --> 00:16:42.940
man. It's amazing. It's amazing that my Dixie's my hand company.

270
00:16:42.990 --> 00:16:47.110
He doesn't know who chooses crews at this guy.

271
00:16:48.490 --> 00:16:50.830
Sometimes I have to go. I sneak up behind them on my left hand.

272
00:16:51.880 --> 00:16:55.480
I'll distract him to this hand. I'll be like, Hey, over here, my name is like,

273
00:16:55.481 --> 00:16:58.300
what's going on? And he says, Oh God, he got in my mind. Oh,

274
00:16:58.840 --> 00:17:03.580
this is going to be awkward too. Oh God.

275
00:17:03.790 --> 00:17:08.590
Oh God. What's the other, the other hand is fingering his. Oh God.

276
00:17:09.280 --> 00:17:12.670
I would love to see stats here. My stats. I'd like to see how many, uh,

277
00:17:12.730 --> 00:17:17.380
how many shots I've done, how many beers I've drank, how many toasts I've made.

278
00:17:17.590 --> 00:17:21.400
I want to know how many times I want to know how many times

279
00:17:22.840 --> 00:17:26.980
I would love to see a stat on regrettable statements made by a drunk Bert

280
00:17:26.981 --> 00:17:27.610
Chrysler.

281
00:17:27.610 --> 00:17:31.180
And then I would love to pick that number and hear the statements come up.

282
00:17:31.390 --> 00:17:35.200
I'm the only one in his family and Hollywood don't tell me about movies.

283
00:17:40.990 --> 00:17:40.990
<v 2>[Inaudible].</v>
