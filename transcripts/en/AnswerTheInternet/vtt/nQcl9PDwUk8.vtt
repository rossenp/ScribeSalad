00:00:00.270 --> 00:00:01.860
<v 0>Hi, I'm Orisha fair. Uh,</v>

2
00:00:01.920 --> 00:00:05.070
I have a special on Netflix called double negative and a podcast called skeptic

3
00:00:05.071 --> 00:00:06.350
tank. And I'm here to answer the inner.

4
00:00:12.980 --> 00:00:13.813
<v 1>[Inaudible].</v>

5
00:00:16.520 --> 00:00:19.070
<v 0>If you could. Why? I thought I was going to say, if you could wipe and I'm like,</v>

6
00:00:19.071 --> 00:00:23.150
yeah, I do wipe you wipe one group of people off the earth. Who would it be?

7
00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:25.760
Italians. The worst of the whites. It's no question.

8
00:00:25.850 --> 00:00:28.370
I've already had this thought many times and I would do it instantly.

9
00:00:28.640 --> 00:00:30.380
Anytime you come into contact with an Italian,

10
00:00:30.381 --> 00:00:32.630
it's gonna be a negative interaction for you.

11
00:00:33.470 --> 00:00:35.900
The only good Italians and one who deny their heritage,

12
00:00:35.930 --> 00:00:40.610
who try to hide it the way Jews didn't the Holocaust, would you have a sexy,

13
00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:43.010
their cousins went Powerball. Here's the problem though.

14
00:00:43.160 --> 00:00:47.120
I have one super hot cousin that had already considered having sex with.

15
00:00:47.121 --> 00:00:51.200
So like, uh, you're adding power of all of that. You know what I mean?

16
00:00:51.290 --> 00:00:54.770
This is already a go. Yeah, it's a win-win.

17
00:00:55.520 --> 00:00:59.660
I went to the Powerball $18. I'm in, if you were to be murdered,

18
00:00:59.840 --> 00:01:04.430
who is the most likely suspect? Oh, good question. Who would kill me, dude?

19
00:01:04.431 --> 00:01:08.150
I got a lot of enemies. I've said some devices over the, over the year. So like,

20
00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:11.450
it could be one of many, many people. If I had to be murdered,

21
00:01:11.660 --> 00:01:16.040
who's the most likely suspect. Probably Burke Crusher's wife, Leanne. Um,

22
00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:18.860
she has ample cause to hate man. Makes great jam though.

23
00:01:19.250 --> 00:01:24.110
Would you rather give the first 90% of a blow job or the last 10%?

24
00:01:24.140 --> 00:01:26.480
Would you rather get? Oh, I see time-wise.

25
00:01:28.820 --> 00:01:29.270
<v 1>Okay.</v>

26
00:01:29.270 --> 00:01:32.870
<v 0>So now you've got to think this out because if I get the first 90% that's now</v>

27
00:01:32.871 --> 00:01:33.471
we're talking about,

28
00:01:33.471 --> 00:01:36.080
it's probably going to be an overall at eight or nine minute blow job.

29
00:01:36.350 --> 00:01:39.830
I don't have good technique job. Good skills. Obviously. I know what's good.

30
00:01:39.831 --> 00:01:43.400
And I'll try to like work the balls a little bit. I'm not gonna be an about it.

31
00:01:43.430 --> 00:01:45.770
You know? Why should they hate themselves? Just cause I'm gonna hate myself.

32
00:01:46.040 --> 00:01:50.270
But the last 10% keep them out. I don't want to do the blow job the last 10%.

33
00:01:50.271 --> 00:01:51.680
If you get somebody good in there,

34
00:01:51.860 --> 00:01:55.940
we're talking about like 40 seconds and I'm down in the last 10 seconds.

35
00:01:55.941 --> 00:01:59.330
So we're talking about, Oh, but then, Oh, I see why there's a funny,

36
00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:05.090
the comment I throw up and I'm not one of those guys who are gonna like shoot it

37
00:02:05.091 --> 00:02:07.640
on my. No, if I'm giving a blow job,

38
00:02:07.730 --> 00:02:11.510
I'm taking it to the throat last 10%, just for the experience.

39
00:02:12.080 --> 00:02:15.770
Just so I can know what women are going through for that hot load.

40
00:02:15.800 --> 00:02:18.590
Don't need asparagus though, or anything like that, make it worse.

41
00:02:19.100 --> 00:02:21.380
You're in an open field, armed with a baseball bat.

42
00:02:21.381 --> 00:02:23.510
How many ten-year-olds wearing bike helmets.

43
00:02:23.810 --> 00:02:26.720
Could you take down before they get to you? Okay.

44
00:02:26.750 --> 00:02:28.610
This is a deeper question than it's actually asking.

45
00:02:28.730 --> 00:02:30.770
Are these ten-year-olds trained?

46
00:02:31.070 --> 00:02:34.760
Do they have someone guiding them or are they just randomly there?

47
00:02:34.820 --> 00:02:37.460
And as they start beating them, they slowly have to come to terms with, Oh,

48
00:02:37.610 --> 00:02:40.130
we got to get this guy before he keeps killing all of us.

49
00:02:40.400 --> 00:02:43.880
I'm thinking the ladder. In which case it would be hundreds.

50
00:02:44.150 --> 00:02:46.160
They don't organize. Well, they're not intelligent.

51
00:02:46.730 --> 00:02:48.740
Ten-year-olds to say boys or girls. It doesn't really matter.

52
00:02:48.741 --> 00:02:51.560
I'll beat the out of either one of them. It would be harsher if I it.

53
00:02:51.620 --> 00:02:52.850
I imagine a little girl.

54
00:02:52.980 --> 00:02:55.280
Remember that chick from game of Thrones where she's like awkward,

55
00:02:55.310 --> 00:02:58.220
how much are out? Because I'm a recurrent character, idiots.

56
00:02:58.580 --> 00:03:01.060
Imagine taking a baseball bat as someone cute like that.

57
00:03:01.330 --> 00:03:06.100
And just crack where the thing is. You see them go and ends up moment. And then,

58
00:03:06.820 --> 00:03:10.180
and then the fall let's set this game up actually.

59
00:03:11.620 --> 00:03:12.820
<v 2>Yeah. Oh.</v>

60
00:03:12.820 --> 00:03:17.500
<v 0>Yeah. That'd be a pay-per-view for sure. Um, do to be hundreds,</v>

61
00:03:17.830 --> 00:03:21.940
it'd be hundreds. Even when they come close, I would do the jab straight in.

62
00:03:23.410 --> 00:03:27.130
I would say run. If you want to live, make them all think they can run,

63
00:03:27.131 --> 00:03:29.080
but I'm chasing them down with their short legs.

64
00:03:29.340 --> 00:03:32.760
<v 2>You don't think you'd have any like 10, 10 in like 10 murders and be like,</v>

65
00:03:32.761 --> 00:03:35.040
I can't do this anymore. I'm murdering these kids like mentally.

66
00:03:35.400 --> 00:03:38.700
<v 0>No, physically though. I'd have to rest. That's when they could get me.</v>

67
00:03:38.730 --> 00:03:41.310
But again, their ten-year-olds are not intelligent. They're not organized.

68
00:03:41.460 --> 00:03:43.950
And parents they're on the phones now. So they're not like, you know,

69
00:03:43.960 --> 00:03:44.850
teaching their kids anything.

70
00:03:45.450 --> 00:03:50.040
Would you rather only watch soft core porn or minor league sports for the rest

71
00:03:50.041 --> 00:03:54.180
of your life? Wait, I don't understand the question.

72
00:03:54.690 --> 00:03:56.100
<v 2>Forever. Every time you turn on board.</v>

73
00:03:56.820 --> 00:04:01.470
<v 0>It's only softcore or sports only minor league sports. That's a tough one.</v>

74
00:04:03.630 --> 00:04:06.480
Probably a minor league sports at least say the love of the game.

75
00:04:06.900 --> 00:04:10.920
And to be honest, even minor league, baseball's better than like w NBA,

76
00:04:10.921 --> 00:04:15.570
which is pro they can dunk. Oh no,

77
00:04:16.200 --> 00:04:20.940
no. I bought shop core porn because I. So like, it's not like I'm a, you know,

78
00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:23.160
I'm not like I'm a 16 year old who can't get laid.

79
00:04:23.430 --> 00:04:26.670
I can just find a chick who wins in a street fight street,

80
00:04:26.671 --> 00:04:29.700
fight Mike Vick or Tim. Teebo interesting.

81
00:04:30.300 --> 00:04:35.280
Timbo can call Jesus to his side. Jesus is not known as a warrior. However,

82
00:04:36.900 --> 00:04:40.380
no, it'd be Michael Beck. What do you mean? But of course he might go back.

83
00:04:40.800 --> 00:04:42.990
I was thinking like Michael Vick's age, but it wouldn't matter.

84
00:04:43.440 --> 00:04:46.560
Michael Beck for sure. And then Michael Vick would Tim Tebow's hot wife.

85
00:04:46.980 --> 00:04:49.380
If you could party with one sports team in history, who would it be?

86
00:04:49.381 --> 00:04:53.700
The Miami hurricanes of the bad years. They own Miami, the Coke town,

87
00:04:53.730 --> 00:04:57.360
the transsexual town. They owned it. It was theirs.

88
00:04:57.570 --> 00:04:58.800
They went and wherever they want to,

89
00:04:58.950 --> 00:05:01.800
where the they want that's I mean a sports team. I mean,

90
00:05:02.170 --> 00:05:06.060
do you see the U it was the craziest thing in the world. They were the team,

91
00:05:06.330 --> 00:05:10.110
obviously there's people. I like, you know, the, the mantle era, uh, Yankees,

92
00:05:10.111 --> 00:05:13.350
but like, I'm talking about partying. Like I want Oh,

93
00:05:13.351 --> 00:05:17.460
D with the Miami hurricanes. Well, you know, this is not the first time to,

94
00:05:17.550 --> 00:05:20.390
you know, they'd be like, Oh, get the trade thing. And they would get in there.

95
00:05:20.420 --> 00:05:23.910
They would have one ready dude. Yeah. Yeah.

96
00:05:25.470 --> 00:05:28.470
Okay. By the way, before I read this question,

97
00:05:28.471 --> 00:05:31.860
I was a practice player for the university of Maryland women's basketball team.

98
00:05:32.190 --> 00:05:32.941
For two years,

99
00:05:32.941 --> 00:05:36.360
I practice with those bishops and I went easy on them for maybe 30 minutes

100
00:05:36.361 --> 00:05:39.390
before they elbow mated the neck. And I'm like, we're going Bronco.

101
00:05:39.440 --> 00:05:41.640
We're going to bench six foot nine. Um,

102
00:05:41.670 --> 00:05:44.160
if you could have sex with any person you want at any time,

103
00:05:44.730 --> 00:05:47.970
be can only watch women's sports forever. What'd you do it?

104
00:05:49.440 --> 00:05:51.750
Why did the person do you want at any time? I mean,

105
00:05:51.840 --> 00:05:56.730
Angelina Jolie and our prime will be pretty hot with Jennifer Aniston

106
00:05:56.731 --> 00:06:01.330
watching. It's not in here. No it's sports socks, man.

107
00:06:02.020 --> 00:06:04.060
It's getting better now than letting the transsexuals in.

108
00:06:04.120 --> 00:06:07.390
They're actually starting to break some records, having a sport sports times,

109
00:06:07.391 --> 00:06:09.100
but you can watch it. Yeah.

110
00:06:09.101 --> 00:06:12.160
They need some people identifying as women to get into the NBA and actually show

111
00:06:12.170 --> 00:06:15.850
some good dunks and. And once I got terrible at it,

112
00:06:15.920 --> 00:06:18.580
that's only if you like women's sports, who's watching them. It's more,

113
00:06:18.700 --> 00:06:20.920
it's the first place. You just feel bad for them. That's why,

114
00:06:21.490 --> 00:06:25.690
if you can have one person narrate do play by play of you having sex.

115
00:06:25.720 --> 00:06:30.340
Who would it be? Um, it wouldn't be what's his name?

116
00:06:30.400 --> 00:06:34.960
He should have died a long time ago for college basketball. Dickie B.

117
00:06:35.020 --> 00:06:39.940
Yeah. He's like the Howard stern now of it's just a shell of himself.

118
00:06:40.870 --> 00:06:44.080
Um, no, I'm going to go outside the box.

119
00:06:44.890 --> 00:06:47.710
Donald Trump is one of the funniest guys in the world and I think he would like

120
00:06:47.711 --> 00:06:51.220
somehow figure out how to bring world politics into it. And it makes sort of,

121
00:06:51.290 --> 00:06:55.050
sort of like metaphor, uh, for taking over the world. Dude, I went traveling.

122
00:06:55.060 --> 00:06:57.400
The best thing was everybody's like, Oh, Americans are dead. I'm like, yeah,

123
00:06:57.430 --> 00:07:00.970
Trump. What? Every time it was like, you shouldn't do that as dangerous.

124
00:07:01.150 --> 00:07:05.050
Like Trump, what I can do what I want in a car chase with the police.

125
00:07:05.170 --> 00:07:09.070
What song is playing in your car? Dude? You don't play music.

126
00:07:09.071 --> 00:07:11.800
You just get the out of there. You don't stop and play with the radio.

127
00:07:12.100 --> 00:07:15.520
Who's talking when I have these questions, internet use your brains, dude.

128
00:07:15.610 --> 00:07:18.130
That's why you guys are failing. Well, Jesus succeeded.

129
00:07:18.700 --> 00:07:22.870
That's why we plant and follow through with it. And like nine 11, we planned it.

130
00:07:23.020 --> 00:07:26.380
We saw it. We made it happen. Oh, you guys didn't know about that. Oh,

131
00:07:26.590 --> 00:07:31.090
can please edit that out? Sorry please. Responsible. Yeah,

132
00:07:31.150 --> 00:07:32.800
I'll use that word. Responsible.

133
00:07:32.950 --> 00:07:36.500
Responsible sounds a little like you're texting and something else happen to

134
00:07:36.700 --> 00:07:40.120
someone else. I mean, planned it more than responsible. Yeah.

135
00:07:40.360 --> 00:07:43.450
Executed is a good way to say it. Execute it. Yeah.

136
00:07:44.620 --> 00:07:47.860
Follow the gold. Follow the gold. No Jews died in nine 11.

137
00:07:47.890 --> 00:07:51.040
How do you explain that? How do you explain that? Not one.

138
00:07:51.850 --> 00:07:54.250
Explain that then no one there's one,

139
00:07:54.280 --> 00:07:56.680
because he thought he had time woods in tower one and tower two to end.

140
00:07:56.681 --> 00:07:59.590
He went back in to close a deal and then ran out of time. Yeah.

141
00:07:59.591 --> 00:08:02.440
You guys didn't know that nine 11. It was the Jews.

142
00:08:02.530 --> 00:08:05.340
They communicated with those boxes in their heads. 30 midgets first,

143
00:08:05.350 --> 00:08:09.490
a lion who wins that lion crushes. There's no question about it.

144
00:08:09.491 --> 00:08:10.480
I've often thought about that.

145
00:08:10.510 --> 00:08:15.280
Also pay-per-view $100 I would pay for that easily. I'd be charged 200.

146
00:08:15.310 --> 00:08:17.110
I grumble about it and also pay

147
00:08:19.810 --> 00:08:20.860
these minority midgets.

148
00:08:21.400 --> 00:08:26.380
Or are these like sort of a diverse group of midgets or we have sorta like,

149
00:08:27.130 --> 00:08:31.240
yeah, by the way, that almost happened when they were doing an original, um,

150
00:08:31.270 --> 00:08:33.910
wizard of Oz thing where they were trying to have all the, uh,

151
00:08:33.970 --> 00:08:37.900
and then after that did happen, he, this lion killed a bunch and they said, Hey,

152
00:08:37.960 --> 00:08:41.530
how can we get a guy in a calorie line outfit instead of an actual lion?

153
00:08:42.760 --> 00:08:45.670
Yeah. Towards the back in those days, majors didn't have many rights.

154
00:08:46.150 --> 00:08:49.930
So they were like, Ooh, they felt bad, but no repercussions.

155
00:08:50.230 --> 00:08:54.460
Would you rather prove aliens are real or prove ghosts, surreal,

156
00:08:55.410 --> 00:08:58.890
uh, aliens. For sure. Ghosts don't do anything. Even if they're real. It's like,

157
00:08:58.920 --> 00:09:02.160
okay, I guess there's spirits here, but still got to go to work.

158
00:09:02.360 --> 00:09:06.120
So got to work on their resume. If aliens are real, should change it.

159
00:09:06.121 --> 00:09:08.190
You can go places Hitchhiker's guide to the galaxy.

160
00:09:08.191 --> 00:09:11.640
You can get out there and see the world. You think you're traveling well now,

161
00:09:11.641 --> 00:09:13.800
like go to another galaxy dude.

162
00:09:16.790 --> 00:09:19.580
Also alien sex would be great, but go sex would just be like,

163
00:09:19.581 --> 00:09:24.500
you air would just be like, um, nah, I guess,

164
00:09:24.501 --> 00:09:29.120
but this, you know, imagine like a vagina inside the vagina,

165
00:09:29.240 --> 00:09:33.920
my mind in alien thing opened up and then like, yeah, yeah. But that with,

166
00:09:36.260 --> 00:09:39.770
come on, you gotta try it. You have to at least try it and then be like,

167
00:09:39.950 --> 00:09:42.890
and then there's a third mouth with like a teeth. And like, I'll just short.

168
00:09:43.430 --> 00:09:46.970
I'll risk it. Who went to the street fight, Allen Iverson or yang dude.

169
00:09:46.971 --> 00:09:48.800
I ran into yang at,

170
00:09:49.250 --> 00:09:53.300
in Egypt at the pyramids. You can't miss him.

171
00:09:54.020 --> 00:09:57.710
I would, you can't mess up. You see this tower. And you're like, what?

172
00:09:57.711 --> 00:09:59.300
And it's like, Oh, that's y'all man. For sure.

173
00:09:59.450 --> 00:10:01.850
And I was kind of walking past him. I was, I was photo bombing,

174
00:10:01.851 --> 00:10:02.900
a bunch of pictures,

175
00:10:03.050 --> 00:10:05.840
but there's almost all Chinese people that were also there touring,

176
00:10:05.841 --> 00:10:07.880
which are the worst tourist. If you see any,

177
00:10:08.090 --> 00:10:11.480
if you're anywhere in China as like a tour bus of Chinese group leave,

178
00:10:11.510 --> 00:10:14.810
come back the next day or just don't do it. They will do it another trip. Um,

179
00:10:14.990 --> 00:10:15.830
anyway, he was there.

180
00:10:15.831 --> 00:10:18.170
I was trying to like photo bomb in the back to hopefully someone would like,

181
00:10:18.200 --> 00:10:23.090
is that a tiny Orisha fear behind a giant y'all man can crush Allen Iverson who

182
00:10:23.091 --> 00:10:24.980
crush Alzheimer's. And now that I'm thinking about it,

183
00:10:25.190 --> 00:10:28.490
he would give him one of these and he would that's it. I don't know.

184
00:10:28.940 --> 00:10:32.870
Obviously there's no, not to practice. And Yamin would practice for that fight.

185
00:10:34.760 --> 00:10:38.930
Yeah. It'd be filming for sure. And then you have things he's old,

186
00:10:39.140 --> 00:10:42.140
always got no legs. Allen's got the speed and agility.

187
00:10:42.200 --> 00:10:45.740
He had the speed and agility and he still got more than two.

188
00:10:45.741 --> 00:10:47.510
There was this move that I tried playing with.

189
00:10:47.870 --> 00:10:50.450
Could we saw Iris do it when I was with the girls' basketball team and I

190
00:10:50.451 --> 00:10:54.470
perfected it and ran it once where you, you start to do the three 60, right.

191
00:10:54.830 --> 00:10:58.310
Dribble. But instead of that, as you do it, you throw the ball this way.

192
00:10:59.030 --> 00:11:02.150
So as they come, cause you just, you have, it helps if you're slow.

193
00:11:02.300 --> 00:11:04.040
Cause they think they can steal it when you would come in this way,

194
00:11:04.220 --> 00:11:08.150
but you throw it this way. They catch nothing. And then you, Oh,

195
00:11:08.180 --> 00:11:11.720
I did it once in a practice. Yeah. Coach Wella was like, stop practicing.

196
00:11:11.721 --> 00:11:13.850
She goes, what was that? And I was like,

197
00:11:13.851 --> 00:11:17.600
that was the Allen Iverson hall of fame coach stopped. I asked, I begged,

198
00:11:17.660 --> 00:11:21.940
let me in one game, coach Weller. I painted my nails back then I had long hair.

199
00:11:22.040 --> 00:11:26.720
I'm like just scrub time. Not real minutes. She said rules.

200
00:11:27.230 --> 00:11:31.430
Would you wrap them? Imagine Johnson a regular me without AIDS. Well,

201
00:11:31.431 --> 00:11:34.160
he doesn't have AIDS yet. As far as I know HIV,

202
00:11:34.161 --> 00:11:37.280
but I see what you're side on here. Um,

203
00:11:37.880 --> 00:11:40.400
magic Johnson or me with her it's well,

204
00:11:40.401 --> 00:11:42.170
I hate the Lakers then my least favorite team.

205
00:11:42.920 --> 00:11:44.900
I did like them in the magic Johnson days.

206
00:11:46.820 --> 00:11:50.300
I think probably just me regular me, you know,

207
00:11:51.260 --> 00:11:56.100
because of the AIDS I was stopped myself and I was thinking, well,

208
00:11:56.230 --> 00:11:58.990
his age, he also wouldn't be able to do comedy. You know,

209
00:11:58.991 --> 00:12:01.390
he was a failure now with the Lakers rebuilding with a prom,

210
00:12:01.391 --> 00:12:06.160
but really it's sound to the AIDS. You know,

211
00:12:06.190 --> 00:12:10.720
you get sidetracked sometimes with extra details, but that AIDS is like a,

212
00:12:12.280 --> 00:12:14.800
I don't want to say deal breaker, but you know what I mean?

213
00:12:14.801 --> 00:12:18.070
Like if you have a woman and like, who like, do I need to wear a condom?

214
00:12:18.071 --> 00:12:22.000
She's like, um, maybe like, Oh, because you're unsure of herself. It's like,

215
00:12:22.120 --> 00:12:25.840
and then like, yeah, no, I mean age like, Oh yeah.

216
00:12:25.870 --> 00:12:29.650
Maybe I'll maybe I'll go back to Tinder and see what else is out there today.

217
00:12:31.180 --> 00:12:35.800
I girls with herpes. I I'll slow, you know? So I don't get it, but like.

218
00:12:40.620 --> 00:12:42.580
<v 1>Yeah, exactly. Yeah.</v>

219
00:12:42.810 --> 00:12:47.490
<v 0>Yeah. Cause it's all scraping. So don't scrape. Just ease it in, make it happen.</v>

220
00:12:48.780 --> 00:12:53.490
Or I guess technically you could wear a condom,

221
00:12:53.520 --> 00:12:57.210
but no one's looking for that. That's obviously that's obviously, yeah.

222
00:12:57.240 --> 00:13:01.350
That's obviously a fantasy world. Uh, I am in between my mom and my dad.

223
00:13:01.650 --> 00:13:06.510
My dad is, my dad is one inch inside of,

224
00:13:06.690 --> 00:13:08.940
of my, my, uh, S

225
00:13:10.710 --> 00:13:15.690
and I am one inch inside of my mother. Doesn't say which side of her I'm into,

226
00:13:15.691 --> 00:13:19.890
but which way do I move forwards or backwards?

227
00:13:21.330 --> 00:13:25.710
Oh, internet God, you guys, first of all, very creative. Always.

228
00:13:28.860 --> 00:13:32.250
I think, Oh my God. I mean, there's, this is one of those no right.

229
00:13:32.251 --> 00:13:33.084
Answer things.

230
00:13:33.630 --> 00:13:38.100
I think I moved backwards into my dad because he survived the

231
00:13:38.101 --> 00:13:38.934
Holocaust.

232
00:13:39.300 --> 00:13:43.260
And if he gets survived that I feel like this would help me survive this.

233
00:13:43.261 --> 00:13:46.890
But even in the Holocaust that didn't make that happen.

234
00:13:47.430 --> 00:13:52.290
Internet has gone further than the Holocaust. Congratulations, internet,

235
00:13:52.291 --> 00:13:53.640
ask questions. You.

236
00:13:57.090 --> 00:13:57.150
<v 1>I'm.</v>

237
00:13:57.150 --> 00:13:58.950
<v 0>Not going to get out of my head anytime soon.</v>

238
00:13:59.850 --> 00:13:59.850
<v 1>Okay.</v>
