00:00:00.390 --> 00:00:03.300
<v 0>Hey, if you haven't already got it. Get yourself a copy of answer the internet,</v>

2
00:00:03.330 --> 00:00:05.760
the card game it's available right now in the link in the bio,

3
00:00:05.761 --> 00:00:08.580
or you can get at Barstool sports, Walmart, Amazon,

4
00:00:08.581 --> 00:00:11.520
or Spencer gifts play along with us. Let's get it. What's up guys?

5
00:00:11.521 --> 00:00:13.740
My name is Trevor Wallace. And today I'm here to answer the internet.

6
00:00:20.270 --> 00:00:20.630
<v 1>[Inaudible].</v>

7
00:00:20.630 --> 00:00:25.280
<v 0>Number one. Would you put your kid in a gorilla pit for 50 K? Yes, bro. What?</v>

8
00:00:25.580 --> 00:00:28.730
This course, kids aren't even worth 50 K in general,

9
00:00:29.060 --> 00:00:30.590
because if I get 50 K from my kid,

10
00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:35.480
that's at least like private school for like what? Four years, bro. Gorillas,

11
00:00:35.540 --> 00:00:36.500
not even that harmful.

12
00:00:36.770 --> 00:00:39.470
Would you rather always have the hiccups or always have a headache.

13
00:00:40.580 --> 00:00:43.550
I would rather commit suicide, bro. Both. Those are terrible. Uh,

14
00:00:43.580 --> 00:00:47.240
I'm a go with always have a headache and just be addicted to Advil.

15
00:00:47.420 --> 00:00:50.390
I'll just get a brand deal with Advil and just be popping. Cause hiccups.

16
00:00:50.720 --> 00:00:54.230
Nobody likes it. Any with hiccups. Shut up, dude.

17
00:00:54.470 --> 00:00:57.620
Cause everybody's offering you water all the time. As a kid,

18
00:00:57.621 --> 00:00:59.900
my mom used to give me a spoonful of sugar and she'd be like,

19
00:00:59.901 --> 00:01:01.880
that gets rid of it. I was like, it gets rid of hiccups,

20
00:01:01.910 --> 00:01:05.570
but it gives you diabetes. Mom, do you want me on this planet or not? You know,

21
00:01:05.720 --> 00:01:09.350
if you came across a glory hole, would you put your Dick in it? Yes,

22
00:01:10.010 --> 00:01:13.520
because honestly, no,

23
00:01:13.550 --> 00:01:15.200
I was thinking about this the other day.

24
00:01:15.201 --> 00:01:18.770
Like you don't come across them all that often. You know, it's like,

25
00:01:18.950 --> 00:01:21.230
I've seen Mount Rushmore. I've been to the grand Canyon,

26
00:01:21.231 --> 00:01:24.140
but never once have I been like, that's a glory hole right there,

27
00:01:24.470 --> 00:01:26.600
plus you never know who's knocking on the other side.

28
00:01:26.601 --> 00:01:30.740
So if I'm in there and I get a tick on the other side, bro,

29
00:01:31.220 --> 00:01:33.350
that's look, I was, I want to try a glory hole.

30
00:01:34.060 --> 00:01:35.990
<v 1>But that's kind of the point. You don't know what's on the other side.</v>

31
00:01:36.080 --> 00:01:38.210
So you know what if it's like.

32
00:01:38.990 --> 00:01:42.530
<v 0>But there's a wall in front of you, so Hey, it's 2019, whatever it's touching,</v>

33
00:01:42.531 --> 00:01:43.364
it's touching it. You know,

34
00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:47.360
would you rather be hairless or never be able to cut your own hair,

35
00:01:49.290 --> 00:01:50.990
I'm going, never cut my own hair.

36
00:01:51.230 --> 00:01:53.360
Cause I seen a lot of dudes in Venice that looked like,

37
00:01:53.660 --> 00:01:55.520
but they really long hair and they've really hot girlfriend.

38
00:01:55.670 --> 00:01:59.090
And then I would just invest in like a CBD, like dog food company.

39
00:01:59.480 --> 00:02:02.960
And then just make racks off that because bald dudes, you have to do porn.

40
00:02:02.961 --> 00:02:06.710
That's the only option you have to do porn or managing auto zone.

41
00:02:06.740 --> 00:02:10.880
And I'm going long hair hippie, you know,

42
00:02:10.940 --> 00:02:14.720
would you rather your mom or daughter be a porn star? God it. Um,

43
00:02:15.820 --> 00:02:19.490
I'm going to have to go with my food.

44
00:02:23.120 --> 00:02:25.730
it. Um, I am God.

45
00:02:26.240 --> 00:02:30.110
I'm doing my mom's a porn star because then I had a better childhood.

46
00:02:30.260 --> 00:02:31.430
Cause she had porn star money.

47
00:02:31.460 --> 00:02:35.600
Now I get to ride a school and a C class Mercedes you know everybody's like,

48
00:02:35.601 --> 00:02:39.140
what does your mom do? Is she, she broadcasted for CBS? I'm like,

49
00:02:39.141 --> 00:02:41.330
she's a broadcaster for Dick. I'll tell you that much.

50
00:02:41.900 --> 00:02:45.770
She broadcasts a sunlight, but th but see, cause if your daughter's a porn star,

51
00:02:46.580 --> 00:02:48.200
everybody, you're the butt end of the joke.

52
00:02:48.201 --> 00:02:51.200
And then what you come across at one late night. Oh,

53
00:02:51.230 --> 00:02:54.290
it's your own couch in the video. And you're like,

54
00:02:54.291 --> 00:02:56.060
I thought that was gravy staying on the couch.

55
00:02:57.080 --> 00:03:00.640
You might make me sit in your own. Okay. Yeah, mom for sure. Ooh.

56
00:03:00.670 --> 00:03:01.570
First one to do this question.

57
00:03:01.571 --> 00:03:06.250
Would you rather let your wife you once with a strap on or take her last name?

58
00:03:06.430 --> 00:03:10.210
When you get married? Hear me out, bro.

59
00:03:11.080 --> 00:03:15.790
I'm gonna start off this answer by saying no homo, but she me.

60
00:03:15.970 --> 00:03:19.060
All right. One time. You don't have to tell anybody,

61
00:03:19.150 --> 00:03:22.990
but if you take her last name, you getting every day, bro.

62
00:03:23.260 --> 00:03:27.940
Every time you put it, we got it to go order for Trevor, uh, Carlston Wallace.

63
00:03:28.480 --> 00:03:32.410
You don't have to say the full part. Chara Carlston was Carmel macchiato.

64
00:03:33.130 --> 00:03:37.210
I said, Trevor, um, yeah, you're doing one. You just taking the, but once.

65
00:03:39.100 --> 00:03:40.330
Oh, if everybody did know.

66
00:03:41.040 --> 00:03:42.960
<v 1>So you either got her last name or you walk in and it's like,</v>

67
00:03:42.990 --> 00:03:44.360
that's the guy who gets butterflies.

68
00:03:46.350 --> 00:03:47.580
<v 0>All right, last name. It is bro.</v>

69
00:03:47.940 --> 00:03:50.580
But I'm married to a girl that has the same last name as me.

70
00:03:50.581 --> 00:03:53.160
So it sounds like I got to start over and I'm like, Oh yeah, I'm Trevor Wallace,

71
00:03:53.161 --> 00:03:55.590
Wallace. Is he mentally right in the head?

72
00:03:55.860 --> 00:03:59.130
Would you rather always come prematurely or never come at all?

73
00:04:01.950 --> 00:04:05.280
I'm going, never come at all. Because then if it goes like,

74
00:04:05.580 --> 00:04:08.550
are you close to finishing it again? I'm sorry. I'm just tired.

75
00:04:08.551 --> 00:04:11.730
You know the classic I'm tired has gotten me out of so many,

76
00:04:11.760 --> 00:04:14.700
just drunken nights where the dig don't work. But if you come,

77
00:04:14.790 --> 00:04:17.730
if you come too quick, then you always gotta have a sob story.

78
00:04:17.731 --> 00:04:22.080
Like I was stressed out. I had too many emails at work. It was windy outside.

79
00:04:22.081 --> 00:04:26.130
I got nervous. The Lakers lost my fantasy teammate and doing too well.

80
00:04:27.030 --> 00:04:28.470
Every time I do nuts too early,

81
00:04:28.500 --> 00:04:32.940
they always got like a background story to back it up. I do that every time.

82
00:04:32.941 --> 00:04:36.060
If I'm under a minute, unlike my grandmother just passed away.

83
00:04:36.061 --> 00:04:39.990
And the sand of your skin reminded me of her funeral. And then she's like, baby,

84
00:04:39.991 --> 00:04:42.150
you don't have to talk about that. We're fine. You know,

85
00:04:42.390 --> 00:04:46.770
it was windy a lot and I was nervous, bro. Blame it on the, uh, blame,

86
00:04:46.860 --> 00:04:50.550
my mother nature. Would you rather a never get oral sex ever again,

87
00:04:50.580 --> 00:04:54.330
or be only, or get only oral sex for the rest of your life?

88
00:04:56.190 --> 00:04:58.200
Wait, both of these are great, but what the?

89
00:04:59.110 --> 00:05:00.840
<v 1>No oral ever again,</v>

90
00:05:02.070 --> 00:05:04.140
the only thing you can do is you can't have regular sex.

91
00:05:04.650 --> 00:05:08.340
<v 0>Oh, okay. I see what you're saying. Um,</v>

92
00:05:08.400 --> 00:05:12.300
never get oral again, bro. Um, you know? Yeah.

93
00:05:12.600 --> 00:05:14.790
That one's just straight up, you know, I don't head,

94
00:05:14.791 --> 00:05:15.780
doesn't always do it for me.

95
00:05:15.781 --> 00:05:18.480
And then the girls always get self-conscious they're like, is it me?

96
00:05:18.481 --> 00:05:20.100
And I'm like, Hmm.

97
00:05:26.040 --> 00:05:26.760
<v 1>[Inaudible].</v>

98
00:05:26.760 --> 00:05:28.740
<v 0>Uh, but yeah, I'm, I'm, I'm sticking straight up to that.</v>

99
00:05:28.800 --> 00:05:32.820
Would you rather be only able to eat cream cheese or catch up? You know what

100
00:05:34.380 --> 00:05:38.310
it says on the bottom 56% of Barstool readers choose cream cheese.

101
00:05:38.940 --> 00:05:42.450
I'm going to go with cream cheese on that ketchup. See it had, they put like,

102
00:05:42.870 --> 00:05:45.900
um, barbecue sauce here. I'll go. Barbecue sauce, big barbecue sauce guy.

103
00:05:46.020 --> 00:05:50.010
It's like catch-up with CrossFit behind it. Um, um, cream cheese.

104
00:05:50.011 --> 00:05:52.080
I don't know what the you put it on besides bagels.

105
00:05:52.850 --> 00:05:56.120
And is there anything else you put it in? Well, I guess I'm going to find out.

106
00:05:56.280 --> 00:06:00.980
Cause all the. I mean the rest of my life, I like cream cheese. Okay.

107
00:06:01.010 --> 00:06:04.760
Would you rather be good looking? I am and always have nice clothes,

108
00:06:04.761 --> 00:06:07.820
but smell like or look like a homeless person,

109
00:06:08.390 --> 00:06:09.830
but always smell nice.

110
00:06:10.850 --> 00:06:11.683
<v 2>Wow.</v>

111
00:06:12.320 --> 00:06:16.010
<v 0>Well here's the thing in 2019, the you look the richer you look right.</v>

112
00:06:16.011 --> 00:06:20.120
That's Kanye, his motto right there. His drip is what he's going by.

113
00:06:20.360 --> 00:06:24.410
So kind of earlier with like the long hair question, I'm going look like,

114
00:06:24.800 --> 00:06:27.980
but smell good. Cause you throw a Gucci logo on it and then they're like, Oh,

115
00:06:27.981 --> 00:06:30.230
is that the new Gucci drunk? It is. It's not,

116
00:06:30.290 --> 00:06:34.970
but it's would you rather a always feel like you have to or

117
00:06:35.300 --> 00:06:36.740
be never know when you're about to.

118
00:06:37.730 --> 00:06:39.710
I'm going to go be I would never like to know.

119
00:06:39.890 --> 00:06:43.310
Cause that that feeling of always have to is constant anxiety. It's like,

120
00:06:43.340 --> 00:06:47.060
it's like being, Oh, you can't control it. You never know.

121
00:06:47.780 --> 00:06:51.650
But when you feel it, you can't run to a bathroom, man.

122
00:06:51.680 --> 00:06:55.340
There's nothing worse than always feeling like you have this. Like I see it.

123
00:06:55.341 --> 00:06:58.970
Like whenever I'm at a girl's house and I know I have this and the toilet's just

124
00:06:58.971 --> 00:07:01.940
staring at me and she's just sitting there at her house is dead silent.

125
00:07:02.270 --> 00:07:04.010
Girls' house is always so quiet when you have to.

126
00:07:04.580 --> 00:07:06.860
So I'm just sitting there holding it and just drinking a coffee.

127
00:07:07.040 --> 00:07:10.940
She's like you could to go for this two hour ride to San Diego. No,

128
00:07:11.000 --> 00:07:14.540
we need to get gas. The car is full. It's a Tesla. Best pull over.

129
00:07:15.050 --> 00:07:19.040
I need to use the bathroom. God honestly, man. I hate that anxiety.

130
00:07:19.190 --> 00:07:23.840
Cause I drink a lot of coffee and knowing you have this is just knowing she

131
00:07:23.970 --> 00:07:25.550
would have to awkwardly feel terrible.

132
00:07:25.730 --> 00:07:29.810
Would you rather be able to any girl you wanted or teleport anywhere in the

133
00:07:30.080 --> 00:07:30.913
world?

134
00:07:32.290 --> 00:07:34.900
<v 2>Hear me out. Teleport.</v>

135
00:07:35.560 --> 00:07:40.360
<v 0>If you can teleport, you can whatever bro. Cause I'm thinking you can be like,</v>

136
00:07:40.361 --> 00:07:44.440
Hey, sorry. I just got back from my meeting in Guam.

137
00:07:44.470 --> 00:07:46.180
W did you want to get drinks? Oh, I'm sorry.

138
00:07:46.181 --> 00:07:49.270
I got to leave in five minutes to go to Bay route. Are we still on for this?

139
00:07:49.510 --> 00:07:52.210
You're like, she probably thinks you got teleportation money.

140
00:07:52.211 --> 00:07:55.150
So you plus God it.

141
00:07:55.151 --> 00:07:58.240
There is so many times where I'm just 30 minutes late to a meeting sitting in

142
00:07:58.241 --> 00:08:02.320
the car. Like if I could just thin this outta here. Um.

143
00:08:03.340 --> 00:08:04.173
<v 2>Also.</v>

144
00:08:04.690 --> 00:08:06.760
<v 0>I was just sat on the bottom. How many Barstool readers?</v>

145
00:08:06.880 --> 00:08:10.150
Because every Barstool supported him. He was always like, Aw, any girl, bro.

146
00:08:10.450 --> 00:08:11.283
anything.

147
00:08:13.390 --> 00:08:15.880
I'm going to teleport and hope and banking on the fact that girls have a King

148
00:08:15.881 --> 00:08:19.000
for teleportation. There's there's gotta be some shake out there.

149
00:08:19.240 --> 00:08:22.570
Would you rather watch only softcore porn for the rest of your life?

150
00:08:22.600 --> 00:08:26.740
That HBO money right there or only minor league sports for the rest of your

151
00:08:26.741 --> 00:08:27.580
life. Okay.

152
00:08:30.790 --> 00:08:32.380
<v 2>Uh, I'm going.</v>

153
00:08:32.740 --> 00:08:36.190
<v 0>Yay. Cause soft core. I like soft core. Cause it gets your imagination working.</v>

154
00:08:36.310 --> 00:08:38.500
It makes you feel like what love really feels like. You know?

155
00:08:38.950 --> 00:08:41.350
Cause the soft core I heard on HBO, they're not actually penetrating.

156
00:08:41.380 --> 00:08:45.010
They're just rubbing. And that gives me hope for the future. You know?

157
00:08:45.430 --> 00:08:48.850
Cause I watched porn I now and I'm like, marriage, why the would I do that?

But you watch enough soft core. You're like, yeah,

159
00:08:51.011 --> 00:08:53.860
I could go to Paris with a girl. You know, I could fall in love.

160
00:08:53.920 --> 00:08:56.430
I could eat a baguette with Stephanie. You know,

161
00:08:56.610 --> 00:08:58.440
if you had the chance to the perfect girl,

162
00:08:58.470 --> 00:09:01.410
but you had to do it with your entire family in the room watching,

163
00:09:01.411 --> 00:09:03.000
would you do it? Yes.

164
00:09:03.930 --> 00:09:08.790
The perfect girl because the perfect girl to me is going to be like a

165
00:09:08.791 --> 00:09:12.660
girl like Halle Berry, my family, my dad is cheering me on like bro.

00:09:12.661 --> 00:09:15.270
Yes or Laura Croft. You know, they're like tomb, Raider.

167
00:09:15.570 --> 00:09:19.050
My dad's in the background being like, that's my son. My mom's just like,

00:09:19.080 --> 00:09:21.630

00:09:27.000 --> 00:09:29.370
Would you rather permanently be on stilts or permanently?

171
00:09:29.371 --> 00:09:30.870
Have phone fingers on each hand?

172
00:09:32.570 --> 00:09:36.530
<v 2>Ah, God it. I'm going foam fingers. Ah.</v>

173
00:09:37.850 --> 00:09:40.040
<v 0>Foam fingers kind of suck because everybody thinks you're well.</v>

174
00:09:43.670 --> 00:09:44.960
Yeah. Well.

175
00:09:45.950 --> 00:09:46.783
<v 2>Um.</v>

00:09:47.930 --> 00:09:52.120
<v 0>Bro, cause you remember me of drunk on stilts. You're losing your,</v>

00:09:52.121 --> 00:09:55.700
your front four teeth immediately. You're, I'm doing,

178
00:09:56.120 --> 00:09:57.020
here's why I'm doing faint.

179
00:09:57.220 --> 00:10:00.590
The foam fingers because you can legally be drunk whenever you want,

180
00:10:00.680 --> 00:10:03.710
because everybody's like, Oh he just left. Oh a Marlins game.

181
00:10:03.711 --> 00:10:06.710
You know like he's good bro. Like he he's, he's always at a sporting event.

182
00:10:07.070 --> 00:10:10.630
And plus when the girl's like, so do you want to like finger me?

183
00:10:10.660 --> 00:10:15.410
Like I wish I could, but it looks like you got to go down on me. So by default,

184
00:10:15.450 --> 00:10:18.470
I just want to get a phone finger. Um, yes, stills, that.

185
00:10:18.740 --> 00:10:21.350
Who would win in a street? Fight. Mike vinegar. Timothy.

186
00:10:23.810 --> 00:10:24.643
<v 2>All right.</v>

187

188
00:10:30.110 --> 00:10:33.500
He got the power of the Lord and every Chick-fil-A employee behind his back.

189
00:10:33.501 --> 00:10:36.740
Just strapped up. Ready with that Polynesian sauce.

190
00:10:36.950 --> 00:10:39.140
Any other day of the week Mike Vick bro. Mike Vick.

191
00:10:39.680 --> 00:10:41.570
I feel like he could take on a small country.

192
00:10:41.750 --> 00:10:45.230
I feel like Mike Vick has single-handedly take down like Atlantic city or

193
00:10:45.231 --> 00:10:49.790
something. Would you rather have all music or all TV be in Spanish? Oh.

194
00:10:52.580 --> 00:10:53.540
<v 2>I'm going to TV.</v>

00:10:54.020 --> 00:10:57.380
<v 0>I love me a good telling the Webber. The love on there bro.</v>

196
00:10:57.410 --> 00:11:01.670
I don't know what the is going on, but the stakes are always so high.

197
00:11:02.090 --> 00:11:03.020
Somebody's always cheating.

198
00:11:03.110 --> 00:11:06.860
Somebody is like always crying and it's it's good cinema, you know? Um,

199
00:11:06.890 --> 00:11:08.750
but if I, if I only listened to Spanish music,

200
00:11:08.751 --> 00:11:11.120
then I just want to drink all the time. It's way too.

201
00:11:11.121 --> 00:11:15.340
Like I feel like I should be on Molly, just Gasolina in this. You know,

202
00:11:16.040 --> 00:11:19.520
if you saw that one of your friends accidentally posted a Dick pic on Snapchat,

203
00:11:19.550 --> 00:11:22.220
would you tell him or would you have him leave it up? That depends.

204
00:11:22.221 --> 00:11:25.970
Does he owe me money? All right. 20 bucks and below I'm telling him,

205
00:11:25.971 --> 00:11:27.350
but if he tells me like 50 bucks,

206
00:11:27.351 --> 00:11:29.930
I'm leaving and he leaving that up there or I'm,

207
00:11:30.290 --> 00:11:33.560
here's what I'm actually going to do screenshot. And now I got blackmail, right?

208
00:11:33.740 --> 00:11:36.020
He was like, Hey man, would you mind driving to the game tonight?

209
00:11:36.050 --> 00:11:37.730
I want it to drink a little bit. I'll be like, Oh,

210
00:11:37.910 --> 00:11:39.110
you want it to drink a little bit?

211
00:11:39.350 --> 00:11:42.980
We should have done that before he whooped a Dick out and bathroom last weekend.

212
00:11:42.981 --> 00:11:46.820
You know? So I'm using that as a, as a I'm using it as blackmail for sure.
