00:00:00.420 --> 00:00:01.500
<v 0>Hey man, I'm Kevin Smith.</v>

2
00:00:01.501 --> 00:00:04.080
And today I'm going to be answering the internet question.

3
00:00:06.430 --> 00:00:07.263
<v 1>Um.</v>

4
00:00:11.630 --> 00:00:16.130
<v 0>Would you rather do the first 90% of a blow job with a last time?</v>

5
00:00:17.300 --> 00:00:18.133
<v 1>Hello?</v>

6
00:00:21.770 --> 00:00:25.730
<v 0>Would you rather be stuck in Jumanji or Jurassic park?</v>

7
00:00:27.350 --> 00:00:30.740
No. This is a fantastic question.

8
00:00:31.730 --> 00:00:34.550
Ain't you Mangi cause there's magic involved there, right?

9
00:00:34.910 --> 00:00:37.610
Like that's how he got into the box or the video game,

10
00:00:37.611 --> 00:00:41.780
depending on which version of Jumanji you're into. So if magic is involved,

11
00:00:42.020 --> 00:00:45.200
that. Because then I could wind up with like eight or something. Um,

12
00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:47.660
I'm going to pick drastic part.

13
00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:51.530
Cause then it's all about it's that you just have to not get eaten.

14
00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:53.630
It's not like suddenly a Raptor is going to be like,

15
00:00:53.990 --> 00:00:56.870
forget a kiss and like magically do some to you.

16
00:00:56.871 --> 00:00:59.810
Like they might in Jumanji and whatnot. So I'm going to go,

17
00:00:59.811 --> 00:01:03.620
I've seen enough Jurassic parks where I think I know what to do, man. And, uh,

18
00:01:04.370 --> 00:01:06.680
and yeah, plus the selfie clickbait alone,

19
00:01:07.310 --> 00:01:10.490
just like stegosaurus, you know,

20
00:01:10.491 --> 00:01:14.060
nobody's got that on their Instagram feed kids. Uh, next step.

21
00:01:14.090 --> 00:01:19.070
Would you rather have a good hand job from your grandmother or a bad hand

22
00:01:19.071 --> 00:01:23.300
job also from your grandmother? It gets no better.

23
00:01:24.230 --> 00:01:27.320
I thought perhaps it'd be like, you know, good one from your grandmother,

24
00:01:27.321 --> 00:01:29.450
bad one from your grandfather or vice versa.

25
00:01:29.451 --> 00:01:34.370
And then it's a real like shark or a drowning situation. Um, well,

26
00:01:34.371 --> 00:01:37.790
I mean, look, I'd always rather get a good hand job at the end of the day.

27
00:01:38.030 --> 00:01:40.100
If you're going to be Dick out, something should come of it.

28
00:01:40.760 --> 00:01:45.170
She's long passed and uh, pretty much on her memory. But yeah,

29
00:01:45.171 --> 00:01:46.820
I'd like a good hand-job from my grandmother.

30
00:01:47.150 --> 00:01:51.740
Would you take $4 million to be on to catch a predator?

31
00:01:51.770 --> 00:01:54.530
Not to clarify you don't get, you don't get arrested. You just are on it.

32
00:01:55.130 --> 00:01:57.770
You're on it. But it's like, Hey, you were wrong. I'm not actually,

33
00:01:57.771 --> 00:01:59.210
but everyone watches you and sees you.

34
00:01:59.240 --> 00:02:01.940
I was assuming I was getting 4 million to be the host.

35
00:02:01.941 --> 00:02:05.330
And I was instantly going to say why. Yes, but Nope. Nope.

36
00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:09.410
You're you're starring in it. The receiving end of it. I'm a, Hey,

37
00:02:09.411 --> 00:02:13.730
what's going on here? That guy. And they ultimately prove that I'm okay.

38
00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:17.240
But after the fact let's say on that show, it doesn't look good for you. I mean,

39
00:02:17.241 --> 00:02:20.900
here's the thing like most people of course would be like, yeah man,

40
00:02:20.901 --> 00:02:25.370
I'll look like a better for 4 million bucks. Um, I,

41
00:02:25.790 --> 00:02:29.600
you know, I'm 48. So I stopped thinking like that in my twenties.

42
00:02:29.930 --> 00:02:33.740
So I say to myself, 4 million bucks, you know,

43
00:02:34.250 --> 00:02:36.260
you put your nose to the grindstone,

44
00:02:36.590 --> 00:02:41.480
make about 1% of that without having to be on to catch a

45
00:02:41.481 --> 00:02:42.314
predator.

46
00:02:42.410 --> 00:02:47.000
Would you rather walk with a roller blade on your left shoe for the rest of your

47
00:02:47.001 --> 00:02:47.834
life?

48
00:02:48.140 --> 00:02:52.760
Or have a midget wait left shoe or have a midget walking in front of you walking

49
00:02:52.761 --> 00:02:57.710
slightly slower than you want to for the rest of your life. And uh,

50
00:02:57.740 --> 00:03:00.790
to add to it, the midget reportedly as a bad temper,

51
00:03:01.630 --> 00:03:03.460
I'm going to go with the rollerblade now,

52
00:03:03.500 --> 00:03:08.110
like to with people like I'm a real played solid Bob for a reason.

53
00:03:08.111 --> 00:03:10.630
I don't want nothing. Don't start none. Won't be none.

54
00:03:10.660 --> 00:03:14.530
So if I've got this shorter individual in front of me and like the whole time

55
00:03:14.560 --> 00:03:18.010
I'm like, come the. Like I know sooner or later I'd be like, did you come on?

56
00:03:18.430 --> 00:03:22.570
So rather than have that moment, just skip it all together,

57
00:03:22.600 --> 00:03:23.470
put it on the skate.

58
00:03:23.710 --> 00:03:28.690
Would you rather do the first 90% of a blow job with a last 10%?

59
00:03:28.990 --> 00:03:33.160
This is almost as good as the Jurassic park question. Oh my God, this is good.

60
00:03:33.190 --> 00:03:35.530
Let me think about this before I give you an answer off the top of my head.

61
00:03:35.770 --> 00:03:37.390
Most of the other ones, I was just blowing through,

62
00:03:37.391 --> 00:03:41.110
like trying to just be clever, but this requires a serious thought.

63
00:03:41.410 --> 00:03:44.200
The last 10%, of course, big climax. And that is,

64
00:03:44.201 --> 00:03:48.280
I think the only thing that has kept me from being gay my whole life,

65
00:03:48.310 --> 00:03:51.730
my brother is gay. His days long has been married to a man for 25 years.

66
00:03:51.940 --> 00:03:55.660
The only reason I never became a full-blown homosexual is because I don't know

67
00:03:55.661 --> 00:03:59.710
that I would know what to say to somebody after they came in my mouth like that,

68
00:03:59.711 --> 00:04:03.730
nobody taught me like what the conversation is like, what does one sale a Crow?

69
00:04:03.760 --> 00:04:05.620
And do you wait and do you just say in seven,

70
00:04:05.621 --> 00:04:07.990
I've asked my brother many times and he's like, Kevin,

71
00:04:07.991 --> 00:04:10.510
that's not the only reason you're not gay. Nobody would you.

72
00:04:10.930 --> 00:04:15.190
So I think I'm not,

73
00:04:15.191 --> 00:04:19.450
I'm not like I'm not against fluids and stuff like that.

74
00:04:19.451 --> 00:04:24.430
So I'm not gonna say that on don't want to do the last 10% because like cheese,

75
00:04:24.460 --> 00:04:25.293
cheese,

76
00:04:25.570 --> 00:04:30.130
but I am a hard worker and methodical and I have,

77
00:04:30.610 --> 00:04:34.810
I know what a man wants. So I think I'd pick the 90% man.

78
00:04:34.811 --> 00:04:37.990
You don't get a lot of the credit. You know, the 10% gets all the credit and.

79
00:04:38.770 --> 00:04:40.900
But like, to me, that makes all the difference.

80
00:04:40.901 --> 00:04:42.820
I'd be like the bull Durham of blow jobs.

81
00:04:43.240 --> 00:04:46.420
I don't know if you're familiar with that movie, but Tim Robbins was the star.

82
00:04:46.421 --> 00:04:49.780
He's the 10%, there was a guy who trained him, men,

83
00:04:49.781 --> 00:04:54.250
the player to be named later. That's who I feel I am and stuff. That's the 90%.

84
00:04:54.280 --> 00:04:57.490
I'm the bull Durham. 90%. I don't need you to know about my record.

85
00:04:57.700 --> 00:05:00.220
I can quietly go break it off camera someplace.

86
00:05:01.830 --> 00:05:02.460
<v 2>Thank you so much.</v>
