00:00:00.900 --> 00:00:03.360
<v 0>Uh, what up everybody? I'm Andrew Schultz. And I'm going to answer the internet.</v>

2
00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:05.833
<v 1>Um.</v>

3
00:00:10.430 --> 00:00:12.860
<v 0>You get to have sex with the girl of your dreams,</v>

4
00:00:13.220 --> 00:00:18.020
but they hold a press conference after rating your sexual performance.

5
00:00:18.200 --> 00:00:22.940
Do you do it? Absolutely. Absolutely. Yeah, no, I go on my back. I just,

6
00:00:22.970 --> 00:00:25.130
I that's what I do. That's the only way I can control it.

7
00:00:25.131 --> 00:00:28.190
I just go on my back and then I let her ride it. And then I put the hooks in.

8
00:00:28.460 --> 00:00:31.580
If I can get the hooks in dude. And I just a little rock a baby.

9
00:00:31.910 --> 00:00:34.430
I think I can handle. I can be okay. And some deep breaths.

10
00:00:34.431 --> 00:00:38.210
And I look at the ceiling and I count the boogers on my wall. That's how I last,

11
00:00:38.211 --> 00:00:41.270
I looked at the ceiling. I count my bulgur wall and I get the rocks.

12
00:00:41.271 --> 00:00:45.440
And if I get the hooks, then we can have some fun. She says whatever she wants.

13
00:00:45.441 --> 00:00:49.940
And when it's my time to finish Ben Dover, four strokes gamer.

14
00:00:51.200 --> 00:00:54.170
You're done. Right? I'm done. I'm done. Whenever you're done. Just let me know.

15
00:00:54.680 --> 00:00:57.650
Cause it's over four strokes. If it takes any longer than that,

16
00:00:57.651 --> 00:00:59.660
then you get to do some giggles. All right.

17
00:00:59.900 --> 00:01:04.610
You can read the text message history between two people. Who do you pick?

18
00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:09.720
Oh man. Ooh. Yeah.

19
00:01:09.721 --> 00:01:13.880
Yeah. I was thinking Trump and Cohen, but uh, I don't know enough about it,

20
00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:18.710
but that one would probably be pretty lit. You know what I mean? Like, yeah.

21
00:01:19.220 --> 00:01:23.060
You gave her a hundred. K the. You kidding me?

22
00:01:25.160 --> 00:01:25.993
She's a.

23
00:01:27.830 --> 00:01:30.770
Did 20 grand to see settle it.

24
00:01:30.771 --> 00:01:34.010
10 stupid hundred grand.

25
00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:38.600
I said she got to me. Okay.

26
00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:43.190
Would you rather be the smartest person every time you walk in the room or the

27
00:01:43.191 --> 00:01:47.030
best looking person? Every time you walk in the room? Um,

28
00:01:47.990 --> 00:01:50.270
so here's the thing I rent.

29
00:01:52.340 --> 00:01:56.330
I don't care about being the best looking person that walks in the room,

30
00:01:56.540 --> 00:01:59.300
but I also don't want to be the smartest because then how are you learning

31
00:01:59.301 --> 00:02:02.900
anything? So this is a very tough one, but it's one or the other.

32
00:02:04.190 --> 00:02:08.330
I'd probably, I guess be the smartest person every time I walk in the room.

33
00:02:09.230 --> 00:02:12.440
Yeah. That's how I feel in an Uber pool.

34
00:02:14.360 --> 00:02:19.070
I'm like, what am I doing with these pedestrians? Why did I even do this?

35
00:02:19.340 --> 00:02:24.200
Just kidding. I don't do that. [inaudible] what am I bored?

36
00:02:26.300 --> 00:02:31.250
Would you rather have a dog's personality in a cat body or a cat's

37
00:02:31.251 --> 00:02:34.790
personality in a dog's body dude,

38
00:02:34.940 --> 00:02:36.980
animal trainees are crazy.

39
00:02:37.460 --> 00:02:40.490
This is what's up about it.

40
00:02:41.060 --> 00:02:45.890
I'd rather have a dog's personality and a cat body without a doubt.

41
00:02:46.070 --> 00:02:50.840
Right? That'd be so fun. That's what we want in cats. We don't really want dogs.

42
00:02:50.841 --> 00:02:54.170
The body's kind of. Right? The cat. Body's great. It's nimble.

43
00:02:54.171 --> 00:02:58.310
You just throw them they land. Yeah, you can. If the cat's really good,

44
00:02:58.370 --> 00:03:00.790
you know, it's, it's one of those things like.

45
00:03:01.240 --> 00:03:03.580
<v 2>Um, uh, you know, it's like, you basically, it's like,</v>

46
00:03:03.581 --> 00:03:06.160
you're a guy in a bar and every girl is looking at you. Like

47
00:03:08.830 --> 00:03:08.890
[inaudible].

48
00:03:08.890 --> 00:03:12.480
<v 0>I liked the way you went with it. I went with like the autistic kid. It is a,</v>

49
00:03:12.481 --> 00:03:15.390
you know, works on the high school basketball team or whatever. And then like,

50
00:03:15.690 --> 00:03:17.400
he's a little weird. And then he hits that corner three,

51
00:03:17.401 --> 00:03:21.960
the last game of the year. And you're like, it's Sean. I knew I loved this guy,

52
00:03:23.400 --> 00:03:24.630
bro. That's a shining moment.

53
00:03:24.631 --> 00:03:26.850
They never play those videos where he misses every shot.

54
00:03:27.420 --> 00:03:30.990
And then a coach just takes them out. All right. He gave you 11 shots, buddy.

55
00:03:30.991 --> 00:03:32.610
I don't know what you want to do it. I'd go ahead.

56
00:03:33.170 --> 00:03:37.410
He's shooting at the bleachers. Would you rather have to eat all the hair?

57
00:03:37.440 --> 00:03:41.640
Every time you get a haircut or eat all the fingernails?

58
00:03:41.970 --> 00:03:45.930
Every time you clip your nails, you guys don't eat. Those

59
00:03:48.660 --> 00:03:52.470
do not eat the fingernails in a heartbeat. Absolutely. Even the hair is crazy,

60
00:03:52.500 --> 00:03:56.370
but fingernails, I could do that. I bite my toenails. I bite my toenails.

61
00:03:56.400 --> 00:04:01.290
And when the big toe is thick, it's like a thick nail. Right.

62
00:04:01.320 --> 00:04:03.360
And when I, if I get it off in one piece,

63
00:04:03.900 --> 00:04:07.290
I just use it as a toothpick for a little while. Just like watch some TV.

64
00:04:07.291 --> 00:04:09.780
I like pick I'll chew on it. Yeah. Absolutely.

65
00:04:10.540 --> 00:04:13.890
Hundred percent serious at look, I get my foot up there.

66
00:04:14.730 --> 00:04:15.720
<v 2>I was going to say, prove it.</v>

67
00:04:21.030 --> 00:04:24.090
<v 0>Maybe the most disgusting thing I've ever. Yeah. But it's nice. You need that.</v>

68
00:04:24.091 --> 00:04:26.880
And it's your work? I like admiring the work. You know what I mean? It's like.

69
00:04:27.090 --> 00:04:30.600
<v 2>Get a piece of tree and little down a toothpaste. No.</v>

70
00:04:30.650 --> 00:04:33.900
<v 0>It's not about the toothpick. It's just like, I did that. Like that's mine.</v>

71
00:04:33.930 --> 00:04:36.750
Like I did like, it's like, when you like calm, right?

72
00:04:36.751 --> 00:04:39.570
It's like you don't wash it down right away. You're just kinda like, ah,

73
00:04:40.830 --> 00:04:42.450
you know, you just want to look a little bit,

74
00:04:42.451 --> 00:04:44.670
and then you just in the shower with your foot,

75
00:04:46.620 --> 00:04:51.330
would you rather sit on a cake and eat a Dick or

76
00:04:51.360 --> 00:04:54.480
sit on a Dick and either kick

77
00:05:01.350 --> 00:05:06.060
yo you know what? This depends. How big the Dick and cake are. Right?

78
00:05:06.061 --> 00:05:09.120
Like if it's a small Dick, like if it's,

79
00:05:10.290 --> 00:05:14.220
if it's like half a pinky, right? That's a thorough wipe.

80
00:05:14.490 --> 00:05:17.850
That's not even really sex. Do you know what I mean?

81
00:05:17.851 --> 00:05:22.380
Like I'm going deeper in there to get Dingleberry. So if it's a small Dick,

82
00:05:22.710 --> 00:05:25.200
I'd rather sit on the Dick and then eat a cake.

83
00:05:25.201 --> 00:05:27.600
It doesn't matter the size of cake. Right? It's gonna be slight discomfort.

84
00:05:27.601 --> 00:05:32.070
It's like carrying a shank into prison. It's not even gay.

85
00:05:32.071 --> 00:05:33.270
I'm just protecting myself

86
00:05:36.540 --> 00:05:38.520
without a doubt. I'm not eating a Dick. That's nuts.

87
00:05:41.850 --> 00:05:46.560
Would you rather, every time you come, it comes out of your mouth

88
00:05:48.900 --> 00:05:53.610
or it's a two liter bottles worth. Whoa, buddy.

89
00:05:54.920 --> 00:05:56.100
Well, let me tell you something.

90
00:05:57.230 --> 00:06:01.400
Give me the two liter would be incredible.

91
00:06:01.401 --> 00:06:02.450
Are you kidding me?

92
00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:06.280
<v 3>But what do you think about it? Like what about when you're just like,</v>

93
00:06:06.490 --> 00:06:09.490
like you're, you're up. It's 2:00 AM. You're trying to fall asleep. You guys.

94
00:06:10.450 --> 00:06:11.620
<v 0>Open the window.</v>

95
00:06:14.290 --> 00:06:17.710
It's going to be some inclement weather in grammar this evening.

96
00:06:25.180 --> 00:06:27.820
[inaudible] real. Talk to leaders. Let's go, man.

97
00:06:29.290 --> 00:06:31.900
I'd like to not in the condom and just watch a balloon out.

98
00:06:34.870 --> 00:06:38.530
Would you rather go to jail for one year or go to jail with a Rubik's cube and

99
00:06:38.531 --> 00:06:42.880
you can leave when it's done. Give me a year. Okay. Give me a year.

100
00:06:42.940 --> 00:06:44.650
I'm on good behavior. I'm out at nine months.

101
00:06:45.010 --> 00:06:49.000
There's no way I'm solving a Rubik's cube. Okay. I'm Caucasian.

102
00:06:49.840 --> 00:06:52.870
Okay. I don't know if you've seen the YouTube videos. No,

103
00:06:52.871 --> 00:06:54.790
a lot of guys like me figured that out.

104
00:06:56.680 --> 00:07:01.300
Could I make myself Chinese before? Because that would change a lot. Thanks

105
00:07:03.580 --> 00:07:07.450
dude. You wouldn't even close the door. Sure.

106
00:07:09.190 --> 00:07:14.170
If your belly button was a real button and you could push it once a day to

107
00:07:14.171 --> 00:07:19.090
make anything happen, what would you do? I mean, the right thing is obviously,

108
00:07:19.450 --> 00:07:23.170
you know, drop food over East Africa. But, um,

109
00:07:23.500 --> 00:07:27.130
what I would do is like a gust of wind would just come by.

110
00:07:27.131 --> 00:07:28.660
If a girl was born skirt,

111
00:07:32.290 --> 00:07:33.123
[inaudible], don't put that.

112
00:07:41.020 --> 00:07:43.120
[inaudible] all due respect, you know, others back then

113
00:07:44.770 --> 00:07:48.040
I have a choice between world peace and a sum of money.

114
00:07:48.250 --> 00:07:52.990
How high does that amount of money needs to be? Uh, for me to say, world peace.

115
00:07:55.030 --> 00:07:57.340
Uh, you know what I like about this question is, uh,

116
00:07:58.360 --> 00:08:02.620
you know that there's an amount it's not either or it's

117
00:08:03.820 --> 00:08:08.320
it already bakes in? What's the number. Yes. Um, yeah. It's like,

118
00:08:08.321 --> 00:08:12.790
cause like world peace, like, do we even want well paced? Like what?

119
00:08:12.791 --> 00:08:15.910
Think about all the jobs that will be lost. If we have world peace,

120
00:08:15.911 --> 00:08:20.260
like you gotta really think about world. Peace is going to destroy the economy.

121
00:08:20.261 --> 00:08:23.200
There's going to be people hungry all over the place. Yeah. We're peaceful.

122
00:08:23.230 --> 00:08:27.670
But you starve to death, you know? There's no news anymore. News is gone.

123
00:08:27.850 --> 00:08:30.940
My job as a comedian, I can't be a comedian.

124
00:08:31.000 --> 00:08:34.600
If nothing's happening in the world, 50 bucks,

125
00:08:34.690 --> 00:08:38.710
I think 50 bucks. I'll take it just so we don't have world peace.

126
00:08:38.740 --> 00:08:42.820
That's the last thing we need right now. If I'm being selfish, I got one life.

127
00:08:42.821 --> 00:08:46.840
I don't want to be kumbaya for the rest of it. No, I would. I mean, look,

128
00:08:46.841 --> 00:08:49.870
I'd probably say a lot more, but it would be, you know,

129
00:08:49.871 --> 00:08:52.880
it would be like Kaepernick with the NFL. It'd be like, he'd be like,

130
00:08:52.900 --> 00:08:55.530
I want a hundred million. They're like five it. Okay.

131
00:09:00.780 --> 00:09:01.051
Okay.

132
00:09:01.051 --> 00:09:05.250
Would you rather be able to eat as much as you want without getting fat or never

133
00:09:05.251 --> 00:09:09.740
have to be pay for a meal again? No. As much as I want without getting fat.

134
00:09:09.741 --> 00:09:14.630
Are you kidding me without a doubt? No question. I'm ready.

135
00:09:15.050 --> 00:09:20.000
I don't know if you've know that yet guys. I'm wealthy. Okay.

136
00:09:20.150 --> 00:09:24.470
Am I out of focus? Bring it back. I'm rich. Okay.

137
00:09:24.650 --> 00:09:27.950
Uber black sometimes. All right.

138
00:09:28.220 --> 00:09:32.330
If it's not surcharge and I'm going to LaGuardia instead of JFK. All right,

139
00:09:32.570 --> 00:09:36.410
Dave Guedes eggs. My point is bring on the carbs.

140
00:09:37.730 --> 00:09:41.210
I'm eating cake, whether I'm sitting on a Dick or not.

141
00:09:44.510 --> 00:09:49.100
Okay. Would you rather wake up every morning to a or $100 under your pillow?

142
00:09:49.320 --> 00:09:53.270
$100 under my pillow, without a doubt, without a doubt,

143
00:09:53.271 --> 00:09:56.090
I don't have that highest sex drive that I need. My Dick sucked every morning.

144
00:09:56.180 --> 00:09:58.430
Matter of fact, it's more of a nuisance at times.

145
00:09:58.730 --> 00:10:03.320
There are moments where a girl is playing with my soft

146
00:10:03.440 --> 00:10:06.800
Dick in the morning that I know is not going to get hard.

147
00:10:07.310 --> 00:10:11.480
And there is nothing more masculine waiting than when she just

148
00:10:12.050 --> 00:10:16.100
stops playing with it and then taps it a couple times ago.

149
00:10:16.580 --> 00:10:17.413
Okay.

150
00:10:22.280 --> 00:10:23.870
So give me the Benjamin.

151
00:10:28.400 --> 00:10:29.450
Thank you so much, man.
