00:00:00.450 --> 00:00:03.030
<v 0>Uh, hi, I'm Glenn Howerton, uh,</v>

2
00:00:03.060 --> 00:00:05.820
from AP bio and it's always sunny in Philadelphia.

3
00:00:05.821 --> 00:00:08.610
And I'm going to answer some questions from the internet.

4
00:00:08.720 --> 00:00:09.553
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

5
00:00:15.650 --> 00:00:19.040
<v 0>You are in an open field, armed with a baseball bat.</v>

6
00:00:21.260 --> 00:00:25.040
Picture that. Okay. How many, 10 year olds wearing bike helmets.

7
00:00:25.070 --> 00:00:26.870
Could you take down before they get you?

8
00:00:27.560 --> 00:00:30.320
So just a wave of ten-year-olds coming at you and game of Thrones.

9
00:00:30.610 --> 00:00:31.820
It wouldn't matter. I'd get them all.

10
00:00:33.470 --> 00:00:37.790
Absolutely infinite. I'd destroy those kids.

11
00:00:37.820 --> 00:00:39.530
10 years old. Oh, they're.

12
00:00:42.610 --> 00:00:46.220
I'd be John Snow. I'd be jealous. I'd be John Snow all over that.

13
00:00:47.150 --> 00:00:50.960
Just ten-year-old bodies all over the place. It was a little idiots thing.

14
00:00:50.990 --> 00:00:52.790
What are they going to do to me? Idiots?

15
00:00:53.210 --> 00:00:56.600
Would you rather live in a world where everyone, but you is male or female?

16
00:00:56.630 --> 00:01:00.890
Female. Female. Yeah, absolutely.

17
00:01:01.430 --> 00:01:03.870
Yeah. Female, no doubt. Okay.

18
00:01:04.880 --> 00:01:09.380
I find men to be extremely irritating. I, I prefer women on almost every level.

19
00:01:09.650 --> 00:01:13.340
Do you think there are more porn stars or murders in the world now,

20
00:01:13.420 --> 00:01:16.490
when you say murders, are we talking about like, uh,

21
00:01:16.550 --> 00:01:20.180
people who have murdered or people who didn't desire to murder?

22
00:01:20.930 --> 00:01:24.380
Not and, and Lee enjoyed murdering and want to murder more?

23
00:01:25.130 --> 00:01:27.230
Not just like somebody who murdered. And it was like,

24
00:01:27.260 --> 00:01:31.370
I feel bad if you kill the human. Oh, I see. Okay.

25
00:01:31.371 --> 00:01:34.790
Anyone who is murdered? Uh, murders.

26
00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:39.740
Yeah, the whole world here.

27
00:01:40.130 --> 00:01:44.270
50,000 straight to your bank account or 500,000 in Penny's

28
00:01:44.810 --> 00:01:48.590
can't convert the pennies. Ooh. Uh,

29
00:01:49.160 --> 00:01:51.230
I'll go with $500,000 because, uh,

30
00:01:51.260 --> 00:01:55.970
I think it'd be real fun to have to pay for something that's a thousand dollars

31
00:01:56.060 --> 00:01:59.000
and bring in a ton of pennies. I just think that'd be easy. So yeah,

32
00:01:59.170 --> 00:02:03.830
he's such an. One free throw shot.

33
00:02:03.860 --> 00:02:07.130
If you make it, you get $1 million. If you miss it,

34
00:02:07.790 --> 00:02:11.840
you can never text again. Do you take the shot? No,

35
00:02:12.560 --> 00:02:15.800
I don't take the shot. What could you hit it? Do you,

36
00:02:16.610 --> 00:02:21.230
are you okay on the back? You hit it. I can hit it, but it's still not worth it.

37
00:02:21.350 --> 00:02:25.790
I mean, you know, you're rich, whatever. Yeah. I'm already rich. Ooh,

38
00:02:25.910 --> 00:02:30.530
10 million. Yeah. I'd take the shot. I'd take the shot. Yep. Uh,

39
00:02:30.531 --> 00:02:34.850
would you rather be the president, the Pope or the ruler of North Korea?

40
00:02:40.730 --> 00:02:44.840
The president. Yeah, I can do it.

41
00:02:47.040 --> 00:02:51.290
Look who's president right now. I think I got it. I think I got it.

42
00:02:53.140 --> 00:02:55.820
Isn't Trump is going to do it, then I can definitely do that. Guy's a idiot.

43
00:02:56.150 --> 00:02:59.030
Would you rather have a Dick as your nose

44
00:03:01.030 --> 00:03:03.790
or nose as your Dick? Uh,

45
00:03:06.340 --> 00:03:08.880
I mean, that's just crazy. Uh, uh,

46
00:03:11.110 --> 00:03:14.360
I'd rather have a Dick as my nose. It's not,

47
00:03:14.460 --> 00:03:17.280
it's gonna be bad for the acting career, but that pick something else.

48
00:03:18.390 --> 00:03:21.090
Would you rather have your girlfriend's hair or your girlfriend or your

49
00:03:21.091 --> 00:03:23.940
girlfriend has your hair? Oh, Hmm.

50
00:03:26.160 --> 00:03:30.470
I think, uh, well it's my I,

51
00:03:30.720 --> 00:03:34.950
that my girlfriend has my hair got good hair. What do you want from me?

52
00:03:36.810 --> 00:03:37.643
That's good. That's good hair.

53
00:03:38.880 --> 00:03:41.430
There were stats available for every aspect of your life.

54
00:03:41.460 --> 00:03:45.600
What three stats would you would you want to see? Yeah, I'd be curious.

55
00:03:45.601 --> 00:03:49.020
Like how many drinks have I had in a lifetime? That'd be, that'd be interesting.

56
00:03:49.770 --> 00:03:52.950
Um, Oh,

57
00:03:53.220 --> 00:03:56.640
how many people dislike me as a human being? Like, not,

58
00:03:56.670 --> 00:03:58.560
not like the dislike me from television,

59
00:03:58.561 --> 00:04:02.310
but like how many people have I like actually off in real life?

60
00:04:02.910 --> 00:04:07.680
Cause I know, cause I've actually tried really hard not to,

61
00:04:07.840 --> 00:04:08.820
to people off.

62
00:04:08.870 --> 00:04:12.420
I actually consider myself kind of a good person in spite of the characters that

63
00:04:12.421 --> 00:04:16.590
I play. Um, so, but I'm sure there are people out there like, yeah,

64
00:04:16.591 --> 00:04:20.070
I hate that guy. He did X, Y, and Z. And I'm like, I, what I did, what, uh,

65
00:04:20.071 --> 00:04:22.380
you've been put in charge of running, running,

66
00:04:22.381 --> 00:04:26.430
heck heck the afterlife for people,

67
00:04:28.710 --> 00:04:31.080
the afterlife for people, not evil enough for hell.

68
00:04:31.470 --> 00:04:33.330
What's the first torture you design.

69
00:04:34.830 --> 00:04:38.520
I'm not evil enough for help. Um,

70
00:04:43.980 --> 00:04:47.850
uh, cut their tongues out. I just don't want to hear about it.

71
00:04:48.990 --> 00:04:50.100
You know what I mean? I don't want to hear about it.

72
00:04:52.080 --> 00:04:55.560
What would you do to get rid of the hell that's happening?

73
00:04:57.180 --> 00:05:00.850
I cut off anything that sticks out, sticks out. Would you rather have half,

74
00:05:01.050 --> 00:05:05.130
half your teeth or half year? Half your hair? My half my hair. I mean,

75
00:05:05.460 --> 00:05:08.790
half my teeth. That would, that'd be a problem on many levels.

76
00:05:09.660 --> 00:05:14.340
I'd rather have half my hair. All right. Thank you very much.
