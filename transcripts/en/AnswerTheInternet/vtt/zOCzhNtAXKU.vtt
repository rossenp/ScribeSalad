00:00:00.390 --> 00:00:04.470
<v 0>Hey, it's David sped. I'm here to answer the internet in one take.</v>

2
00:00:04.471 --> 00:00:05.304
That was good.

3
00:00:11.660 --> 00:00:15.140
Would you rather give the first 90% of a or the last 10

4
00:00:17.420 --> 00:00:21.290
I'm giving the blow job? You're like see internet.

5
00:00:22.040 --> 00:00:23.360
They want to know.

6
00:00:25.010 --> 00:00:28.310
So the first nine seconds or the last one second,

7
00:00:31.530 --> 00:00:36.120
that's me. Uh, I guess the first 90 seems a little less messy.

8
00:00:37.760 --> 00:00:42.230
You get to choose between a sum of money or world peace. Um, I,

9
00:00:42.410 --> 00:00:44.120
I know which one I'm heading towards already.

10
00:00:44.720 --> 00:00:48.170
How much does that sum of money need to be in order for you not to choose world

11
00:00:48.171 --> 00:00:53.000
peace? This one's too dense. I don't quite follow it. Uh,

12
00:00:53.030 --> 00:00:56.780
I do. I need a lot of money, so, uh, I, I have to pick world.

13
00:00:56.810 --> 00:00:59.990
I have to pick world peace. No, I don't want to,

14
00:01:02.180 --> 00:01:05.690
whatever. What if someone watched this? I'm not worried about that though. Uh,

15
00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:09.650
if every time you finish sex, always acts a song played,

16
00:01:10.760 --> 00:01:14.600
which would it, which would you want it to be a

17
00:01:16.220 --> 00:01:19.100
wishy Davy spade due to, to DC?

18
00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:28.190
Would you rather have your mom? Yeah,

19
00:01:30.260 --> 00:01:32.900
don't bring my model. Would you rather have your mom,

20
00:01:33.470 --> 00:01:38.460
which fourth grader wrote these? Is that you? Nope. That's him. Don't push in.

21
00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:39.323
You'll be embarrassed.

22
00:01:40.940 --> 00:01:45.740
You have to have your mom send you a nude or send all your friends. A nude. Oh,

23
00:01:46.010 --> 00:01:50.210
sent all my F I thought you said send a note to my mom. Your mom sends you one,

24
00:01:50.720 --> 00:01:54.830
or you send one to all your friends. You send nudes.

25
00:01:56.900 --> 00:02:01.220
There's a stock one that goes out a lot

26
00:02:04.130 --> 00:02:05.900
except Chris Browns.

27
00:02:10.040 --> 00:02:12.500
[inaudible] but I tell you what it gets a lot of bites,

28
00:02:14.630 --> 00:02:17.330
I guess. Uh,

29
00:02:17.360 --> 00:02:20.090
I'll S I'll take my best one incentive to my friends.

30
00:02:20.630 --> 00:02:23.510
You can only watch one movie, the rest of your life, Tommy boy,

31
00:02:23.600 --> 00:02:26.870
your black sheep. Shh. You know,

32
00:02:27.530 --> 00:02:32.450
the split on this and out in the real world is probably 90% like Tommy

33
00:02:32.990 --> 00:02:37.790
Baltimore. It's a black sheep, but black sheep does get some props out there.

34
00:02:37.791 --> 00:02:38.690
But I feel like

35
00:02:40.490 --> 00:02:43.990
I might even pick box just because I don't see it as much. I see Tommy boy,

36
00:02:44.360 --> 00:02:48.890
all it's always listen. You can see me any day of the week on TBS at 3:00 PM.

37
00:02:49.520 --> 00:02:51.500
One of my 19 things is flying on it.

38
00:02:52.280 --> 00:02:56.600
Would you rather lose a leg or never have sex again? Oh,

39
00:02:57.170 --> 00:02:59.470
if I lost that middle leg, I could never have again.

40
00:03:02.190 --> 00:03:06.810
Oh, are you okay? Would you rather always wear high heels or a belly shirt? Oh,

41
00:03:06.811 --> 00:03:09.420
I have a bad back, but I have a worst stomach. Uh

42
00:03:14.910 --> 00:03:19.560
[inaudible] I would say belly shirt, just because of my back.

43
00:03:20.190 --> 00:03:22.350
This is horrible for whoever's walking around with me.

44
00:03:23.640 --> 00:03:28.470
Just take your leg off with that. All right. 500 more.

45
00:03:28.590 --> 00:03:33.150
If you could have one person narrate play by play of you having sex,

46
00:03:33.510 --> 00:03:38.370
it would it be Al Michaels is first and then maybe Bob Manary,

47
00:03:38.371 --> 00:03:42.270
you know, Bob mattering is funny. Okay. Okay. All Michaels

48
00:03:45.060 --> 00:03:45.893
I go, huh?

49
00:03:46.590 --> 00:03:49.980
What's the one thing a person can say or do that makes you immediately hate

50
00:03:49.981 --> 00:03:52.710
them? Um, like me back

51
00:03:54.670 --> 00:03:57.900
that's the best we can with that one.

52
00:03:59.370 --> 00:04:00.203
I don't think so.

53
00:04:01.530 --> 00:04:06.360
If you could fight one person to death and switch lives with them,

54
00:04:06.361 --> 00:04:10.290
if you win, who would you fight? Uh,

55
00:04:13.540 --> 00:04:17.880
and I have to fight a girl though, cause I want to win, you know,

56
00:04:18.630 --> 00:04:22.710
just maybe Tina Fey. She's fun.

57
00:04:23.430 --> 00:04:26.820
She's smart, smart writer. And I just saw her yesterday. So just came to mind.

58
00:04:27.450 --> 00:04:31.380
All right, Tina, look out [inaudible].
