<v 0>This video is brought to you by brilliance of problem solving website and app</v>

2
00:00:03.801 --> 00:00:05.000
with a hands on approach,

3
00:00:05.170 --> 00:00:09.360
check them out at brilliant.org/biographics more on them in a bit.

4
00:00:15.380 --> 00:00:16.680
In the early 17th century,

5
00:00:17.080 --> 00:00:21.710
a religious man decided he was going to uncover the architecture of the universe

6
00:00:21.770 --> 00:00:26.630
itself using observations of the heavens and a deep understanding of geometry.

7
00:00:26.660 --> 00:00:29.990
This man conjecture a world of harmonious design,

8
00:00:29.991 --> 00:00:34.710
where the secrets of God's creation could be decipher by anyone willing to use

9
00:00:34.711 --> 00:00:37.430
mathematics, to look for them. In the course of his quest,

10
00:00:37.580 --> 00:00:40.870
this man managed to change our understanding of astronomy forever.

11
00:00:41.360 --> 00:00:46.340
His name was Johan Keer and he would go down as one of the greatest scientists

12
00:00:46.520 --> 00:00:48.860
to ever live born into a divided Europe.

13
00:00:49.380 --> 00:00:52.940
Kepler grew up in a time of unfathomable change, witchcraft trials,

14
00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:54.180
religious wared,

15
00:00:54.460 --> 00:00:58.740
a scientific revolution were all pulling the consonant apart yet Kepler managed

16
00:00:58.741 --> 00:01:00.860
to not just navigate through these changes,

17
00:01:00.880 --> 00:01:05.450
but to do so while transforming science, he discovered laws of astronomy.

18
00:01:05.451 --> 00:01:07.490
He changed our understanding of optics,

19
00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:12.490
pioneered crystalography developed telescopes and even wrote what's likely the

20
00:01:12.491 --> 00:01:16.290
first work of science fiction persecuted for his faith misunderstood in his

21
00:01:16.570 --> 00:01:19.050
lifetime. This is the life of Johanne Kala.

22
00:01:19.490 --> 00:01:21.690
The man who discovered the secrets of the,

23
00:01:28.480 --> 00:01:30.760
When Johan's coupler was born in 1571,

24
00:01:30.820 --> 00:01:34.120
it was into a Europe already reeling from two major revolutions,

25
00:01:34.270 --> 00:01:35.240
half a century alley.

26
00:01:35.560 --> 00:01:39.920
A man named Martin Luther had nailed his 95 thesis to a church door,

27
00:01:39.921 --> 00:01:44.710
kicking off a century and a half of religious upheaval known

28
00:01:44.930 --> 00:01:48.630
as the reformation. 26 years after that in 1543,

29
00:01:48.650 --> 00:01:53.110
the astronomer Nicholas Copernicus had proved that the sun didn't orbit the

30
00:01:53.111 --> 00:01:53.290
earth,

31
00:01:53.290 --> 00:01:57.910
but rather the other way around triggering an even bigger upheaval known as the

32
00:01:57.911 --> 00:02:01.430
scientific revolution. By the time Johan's couple of first open designs,

33
00:02:01.480 --> 00:02:06.380
these twin revelations were causing Europe to strain at the seams,

34
00:02:06.800 --> 00:02:10.380
not the Kless parents would've imagined that he could have lived long enough to

35
00:02:10.381 --> 00:02:13.740
see those seams rip right open. The boy was weak.

36
00:02:13.840 --> 00:02:18.500
He was sickly a prime candidate in those hard times for an early death ands

37
00:02:18.680 --> 00:02:23.060
die. He nearly did before. He was even five Kalo came down with small parks,

38
00:02:23.061 --> 00:02:26.730
a disease left his eyesight damaged and his hands unable to properly function.

39
00:02:26.920 --> 00:02:30.650
Luckily though it didn't kill him and Kepler would live through his illness to

40
00:02:30.670 --> 00:02:32.850
see the sight that would change his life.

41
00:02:33.110 --> 00:02:35.850
The great comments of 1577 was so bright.

42
00:02:35.870 --> 00:02:40.370
It made the whole of Europe stop and GOP up in the kingdom of Denmark.

43
00:02:40.390 --> 00:02:44.920
The astronomer Tijo Brahe, who we are gonna meet again in just a moment,

44
00:02:45.110 --> 00:02:49.080
watched the comment pass and knew that it would transform his life's work.

45
00:02:49.520 --> 00:02:52.440
The young capital though, the great comment was even more important.

46
00:02:52.860 --> 00:02:56.080
It was this event that would one day Mac into an astronomer,

47
00:02:56.140 --> 00:03:00.680
but only after some false starts as a good Lutheran growing up in the holy Roman

48
00:03:01.200 --> 00:03:04.920
empire, a collection of several hundred states, roughly analist modern Germany,

49
00:03:05.760 --> 00:03:09.200
Kapler wasn't meant to be a mathematician when he enrolled at the university of

50
00:03:09.201 --> 00:03:10.840
tubing and in 1589,

51
00:03:10.980 --> 00:03:13.880
it was on the strict understanding that he would study theology,

52
00:03:13.900 --> 00:03:16.800
become a pastor and help spread Luther's gospel.

53
00:03:17.340 --> 00:03:22.190
The vs of this didn't happen is do you entirely to Michael Malin,

54
00:03:23.070 --> 00:03:26.470
Malin is one of those figures. Basically no one today can name,

55
00:03:26.570 --> 00:03:29.710
but who wounds up changing history? Kepler's mathematics.

56
00:03:30.070 --> 00:03:35.030
Ju Mason was a private devote of Copernicus private because these were the days

57
00:03:35.031 --> 00:03:37.070
when saying the sun didn't Abid.

58
00:03:37.071 --> 00:03:40.980
The earth could end with the religious authorities using you as an unwilling

59
00:03:40.981 --> 00:03:43.820
test subject for the shiny new thumbs screws.

60
00:03:43.880 --> 00:03:46.540
But when Mason discovered Kepler loved astronomy,

61
00:03:46.720 --> 00:03:50.300
he broke cover long enough to lend Copernicus's dere,

62
00:03:51.030 --> 00:03:55.980
Orian Colion li V what Kepler read there blew his mind in Copernicus's

63
00:03:55.981 --> 00:03:58.900
heliocentric universe. Kalo saw not Hery,

64
00:03:59.080 --> 00:04:03.010
but the glimpses of God's harmonious design for Kepler.

65
00:04:03.040 --> 00:04:04.810
This was the road to Damascus moments.

66
00:04:04.910 --> 00:04:08.290
The revelation that changed everything from then on,

67
00:04:08.390 --> 00:04:11.250
he devoted his life to studying the stars.

68
00:04:11.510 --> 00:04:13.650
It was the start of a journey that would take him,

69
00:04:13.651 --> 00:04:15.450
not just across the holy Roman empire,

70
00:04:15.510 --> 00:04:20.480
but into more danger than this sickly teen could have ever believe possible.

71
00:04:26.860 --> 00:04:30.240
In 1594, Johans Kepler received an unexpected letter.

72
00:04:30.540 --> 00:04:33.760
Now 23 Kepler was on the verge of graduating university,

73
00:04:33.910 --> 00:04:35.560
despite his devotion to astronomy.

74
00:04:35.561 --> 00:04:39.440
He still planned to become a pastor because that's just what you did in the late

75
00:04:39.441 --> 00:04:40.280
16th century.

76
00:04:40.810 --> 00:04:45.470
The letter changed all of that sent from the Austrian city of grad sit invited

77
00:04:45.471 --> 00:04:49.030
Kepler to come and work as a maths teacher. And just like that,

78
00:04:49.090 --> 00:04:53.630
Kepler was able to throw his boring destiny away and to become the mathematician

79
00:04:53.990 --> 00:04:58.630
had always dreamed of being well almost despite what the letter had promised.

80
00:04:58.690 --> 00:05:00.990
Almost nobody in grads attended Kepler's clown.

81
00:05:01.820 --> 00:05:05.500
He was forced to take a second job as a calendar maker just to survive,

82
00:05:05.680 --> 00:05:09.940
but what Kepler's life in grads lacked in opportunities, success or happiness,

83
00:05:10.410 --> 00:05:12.660
more than made up for with spare time,

84
00:05:12.870 --> 00:05:16.020
spare time in which Kepler could ponder some of science's most pressing

85
00:05:16.021 --> 00:05:19.260
mysteries before caper had come along and dynamite.

86
00:05:19.700 --> 00:05:24.170
Thousands of years of human thinking was accepted that the planets were fixed to

87
00:05:24.171 --> 00:05:27.210
the heavens and that the heavens rotated around the earth.

88
00:05:27.390 --> 00:05:30.490
But now the Copernicus had shown that the earth was moving around. The sun,

89
00:05:30.950 --> 00:05:35.450
all sorts of weird questions had arisen, clearly earth wasn't fixed to anything.

90
00:05:35.451 --> 00:05:39.530
It was just kind of floating along so well. What made it float?

91
00:05:39.920 --> 00:05:41.530
What made the other planets move?

92
00:05:42.080 --> 00:05:45.400
It was while daydreaming in one of his near empty classes in 1595,

93
00:05:45.640 --> 00:05:49.440
the Kepler felt a light bulb go ping right above his head.

94
00:05:49.780 --> 00:05:52.080
If the planets had a regular orbit around the sun,

95
00:05:52.081 --> 00:05:56.600
then surely this was because the sun itself was affecting them with some kind of

96
00:05:56.601 --> 00:05:59.440
force today. We of course would call that force gravity.

97
00:05:59.620 --> 00:06:04.320
But Kepler was living about 50 years before Isaac Newton was even a lustful

98
00:06:04.321 --> 00:06:08.880
twinkle in his father's eye. So well, he called it magnetism still.

99
00:06:08.980 --> 00:06:13.240
It was the very first time anyone in Europe had come even close to understanding

100
00:06:13.350 --> 00:06:15.400
what made our solar system tick.

101
00:06:15.540 --> 00:06:19.710
But Kepler went to even further than just puntificating about the sun.

102
00:06:19.740 --> 00:06:21.790
Curious about the space between the planet.

103
00:06:21.930 --> 00:06:26.510
See hypothesized that each gap must correspond to one of the platonic

104
00:06:26.770 --> 00:06:28.590
solids, the Tetra Hedron cube,

105
00:06:28.900 --> 00:06:31.910
Okta Hedron ISO Hedron and do DECA Hedron.

106
00:06:32.020 --> 00:06:33.950
When his calculations seemed to bear this out,

107
00:06:33.951 --> 00:06:36.270
he declared hit uncovered God's architecture.

108
00:06:36.530 --> 00:06:40.940
So this might sound a little crooky to modern ears. I mean, magic shapes.

109
00:06:41.070 --> 00:06:43.540
God's architecture. What? Well,

110
00:06:43.541 --> 00:06:47.300
we need to remember the era Kepler was living in this was an era before pure

111
00:06:47.301 --> 00:06:47.960
mathematics,

112
00:06:47.960 --> 00:06:52.140
an era in which you could say the sun orbited the earth and not only have people

113
00:06:52.460 --> 00:06:56.340
snicker at you, but then have them imprison your neighbor for disagreeing.

114
00:06:56.860 --> 00:06:57.530
What Kepler's worked.

115
00:06:57.530 --> 00:07:00.490
It was suggest the universe could be understood through maths,

116
00:07:00.491 --> 00:07:04.850
that there was a scientific way of thinking about the heavens beyond simply

117
00:07:04.851 --> 00:07:06.330
saying, God did it.

118
00:07:06.470 --> 00:07:10.290
It is that simple thought that would turbocharge the scientific revolution.

119
00:07:10.690 --> 00:07:12.690
Capital published his ideas in 1597.

120
00:07:12.691 --> 00:07:15.090
The very same year he married his first wife.

121
00:07:15.270 --> 00:07:19.320
Not long after he began writing to Tejo bra. Remember Brahe.

122
00:07:19.340 --> 00:07:22.360
He was the Danish guy who saw the great comment and realized that it would

123
00:07:22.480 --> 00:07:24.800
transform his career while Kepler became his penal,

124
00:07:24.830 --> 00:07:28.400
just as bra was in the process of moving his work to Prague.

125
00:07:28.460 --> 00:07:32.440
It was a relationship that would soon save Kepler's life. In 1599,

126
00:07:32.441 --> 00:07:34.600
the religious tensions simmering across central Europe,

127
00:07:34.601 --> 00:07:37.840
between Catholics and Lutherans boiled over in grants.

128
00:07:37.940 --> 00:07:41.710
The city's Catholics barred against attacking Protestants for the Lutheran

129
00:07:42.070 --> 00:07:45.590
Kepler. This was a, oh boy, better get outta here. Moment. The trouble was,

130
00:07:45.730 --> 00:07:46.630
he had nowhere to go.

131
00:07:46.730 --> 00:07:50.150
His religious buddies back at university had read his book and decided he was a

132
00:07:50.590 --> 00:07:53.350
Copernicus loving heritage who wasn't allowed to hang out with him anymore.

133
00:07:53.540 --> 00:07:57.310
Just as it was starting to look like Kepler might find himself being tar unto

134
00:07:57.710 --> 00:08:02.220
feathered by angry Catholics, bra threw a lifeline. Hey, I've got a crazy idea.

135
00:08:02.700 --> 00:08:05.700
You basically said, why didn't you come work for me in Prague?

136
00:08:05.880 --> 00:08:08.500
And that's how in the dying days of the 16th century,

137
00:08:08.920 --> 00:08:13.260
Johans coupler found himself joining the legendary court of Rudolph the seconds.

138
00:08:13.720 --> 00:08:15.660
But before we get to what he did there,

139
00:08:15.860 --> 00:08:19.220
I do want to take a moment to tell you about today's sponsor brilliance.

as well as their course on mathematical fundamentals.

151
00:08:51.420 --> 00:08:53.800
Or if you want something completely new brilliance of a course,

152
00:08:53.900 --> 00:08:55.200
all about search engines,

153
00:08:55.280 --> 00:08:57.880
which will teach you how search engines like Google work.

154

And let's get back to Kapler.

163
00:09:33.050 --> 00:09:35.940
If you were alive and into spooky in 1600,

164
00:09:35.941 --> 00:09:39.740
there was nowhere better to be than Rudolph the seconds. Prague,

165
00:09:40.060 --> 00:09:43.980
the Roman emperor was obsessed with everything. A cult, the legendary Alchemist,

166
00:09:43.981 --> 00:09:48.220
John D worked for him as did rabbi love. The man said to have created the go,

167
00:09:48.600 --> 00:09:50.940
not that Rudolph distinguished between crackpot,

168
00:09:50.941 --> 00:09:55.300
mysticism and actual science though. He supported alchemists and Astro,

169
00:09:55.750 --> 00:09:58.290
but also astronomers and mathematicians.

170
00:09:58.630 --> 00:10:01.010
And one of those astronomers just happened to bery.

171
00:10:01.570 --> 00:10:05.010
Ry arrived in Prague the year before to take the title of Imperial

172
00:10:05.011 --> 00:10:05.850
mathematician.

173
00:10:06.030 --> 00:10:10.050
His mission was to undertake a new set of planetary observations and then create

174
00:10:10.170 --> 00:10:14.090
a table from the results that could predict where anything in the night sky

175
00:10:14.100 --> 00:10:17.880
would be on a future date. Such tables had existed before,

176
00:10:17.881 --> 00:10:19.920
but they'd been plagued by poor data.

177
00:10:20.640 --> 00:10:24.600
Brahe was determined to make the most accurate table in history. Unfortunately,

178
00:10:24.630 --> 00:10:28.520
history is exactly what Brahe was about to become on October the 24th,

179
00:10:28.521 --> 00:10:33.280
1601 Brahe died rather than halt his work Rud off the second simply handed it

180
00:10:33.660 --> 00:10:37.190
Tory's assistance. This is how Kepler suddenly found himself,

181
00:10:37.290 --> 00:10:41.270
not just saddled with the title of Imperial mathematician and the difficult jobs

182
00:10:41.290 --> 00:10:41.930
to finish,

183
00:10:41.930 --> 00:10:46.710
but also with access to the scientific equivalents of magic pixie dust in his

184
00:10:46.910 --> 00:10:47.510
lifetime,

185
00:10:47.510 --> 00:10:51.310
Bri had been a guy who didn't like to share among the things he didn't like

186
00:10:51.311 --> 00:10:55.910
sharing, whereas astronomical observations, the most accurate in human history.

187
00:10:55.970 --> 00:10:58.220
So when Kepler inherited bra his work,

188
00:10:58.400 --> 00:11:00.900
he also got his hands on these observations.

189
00:11:01.250 --> 00:11:05.580
This data would be the key that helps unlock Kepler's greatest discoveries for

190
00:11:05.581 --> 00:11:07.900
the next decade. Kepler slaved away in Prague,

191
00:11:07.901 --> 00:11:11.900
making new discoveries like a man possessed in 1604, for example,

192
00:11:11.920 --> 00:11:14.660
is attempt to figure out the best way to observe an eclipse,

193
00:11:14.860 --> 00:11:18.650
send him down a rabbit hole that ended in him discovering a how light travels

194
00:11:18.651 --> 00:11:20.890
through the human eye. Remember in science glass,

195
00:11:20.891 --> 00:11:24.530
when you found out that the human eye actually projects stuff onto your retinas

196
00:11:24.550 --> 00:11:27.690
upside down and your brain flips the image the right way up again.

197
00:11:27.780 --> 00:11:31.970
While Kepler was the first to discover that he then used this work to design

198
00:11:31.971 --> 00:11:35.530
highly improved eyeglasses. The same year he was working on optics.

199
00:11:35.890 --> 00:11:39.920
Kepler also became the first to observe what he, a new star in the sky.

200
00:11:40.400 --> 00:11:44.440
Actually, we now know that it was the last recorded supernova in the Milky way.

201
00:11:44.590 --> 00:11:48.120
Many years later, couple's observation would help improve that earth.

202
00:11:48.170 --> 00:11:51.760
Isn't the center of the universe. A few years later in 1608,

203
00:11:51.780 --> 00:11:54.120
he wrote Somnia more the dream in English,

204
00:11:54.121 --> 00:11:56.200
possibly the first work of science fiction,

205
00:11:56.380 --> 00:12:00.200
but it was the book Kepler published in 60 0 9. That really changed the world.

206
00:12:00.880 --> 00:12:05.840
Astronom Nova grew out of Kepler's observation of Mars's orbit after tracing it

207
00:12:05.841 --> 00:12:06.720
through the sky for years,

208
00:12:06.740 --> 00:12:10.960
he finally clicked that the complex twisting trail that we see from earth is

209
00:12:10.961 --> 00:12:15.510
also because earth is moving through space by deploying what in the 16 hundreds

210
00:12:15.511 --> 00:12:17.910
must have, seems like an insane thought experiment.

211
00:12:18.510 --> 00:12:22.230
Kepler managed to show what Earth's own orbit would look like from Mars.

212
00:12:22.340 --> 00:12:22.871
From there,

213
00:12:22.871 --> 00:12:26.910
it was just a small step to prove that Mars's orbit must be elliptical.

214
00:12:27.050 --> 00:12:30.670
It was the first time that anyone had figured out what a planet's orbit actually

215
00:12:30.671 --> 00:12:34.340
looked like. And it was from here that KA LA drew his first law,

216
00:12:34.341 --> 00:12:39.140
that the planets have elliptical orbits with the sun as one of the Faki it's

217
00:12:39.141 --> 00:12:41.580
also from here that he drew the second of his three laws,

218
00:12:41.581 --> 00:12:43.180
which is pretty difficult to explain,

219
00:12:43.240 --> 00:12:47.380
but basically gives you a way to measure the speed that any planet is traveling

220
00:12:47.381 --> 00:12:50.900
around the sun as for the third law. Well, we'll get back to that in a bit.

221
00:12:51.170 --> 00:12:55.410
When Kepler published these findings in Astron Nova in 1609,

222
00:12:55.470 --> 00:12:58.250
he impressively included all his raw data today.

223
00:12:58.251 --> 00:13:01.810
Something that's a given where sciences consent at the time though,

224
00:13:01.830 --> 00:13:05.450
it was almost like a dare for its critics. A way for Kepler to say,

225
00:13:05.790 --> 00:13:09.850
you think I'm wrong to you? Well, study the data and show me where I'm wrong.

226
00:13:10.190 --> 00:13:12.850
The astronom and Nova was a monumental achievement.

227
00:13:12.910 --> 00:13:16.280
One that cemented Kepler claimed a greatness. Unfortunately,

228
00:13:17.280 --> 00:13:20.600
1609 was also the moment Kepler's world began to split apart.

229
00:13:26.990 --> 00:13:28.280
Back in 1555,

230
00:13:28.340 --> 00:13:32.040
the holy Roman empire had managed to stop the consonant exploding with something

231
00:13:32.041 --> 00:13:35.790
called the piece of Augsburg Al and Luther did his thing.

232
00:13:35.850 --> 00:13:39.950
The empire had transformed into a gigantic pressure cooker with Catholics and

233
00:13:39.951 --> 00:13:43.030
Lutherans threatening to unleash holy war on one another.

234
00:13:43.170 --> 00:13:46.870
The piece had released some of that pressure by removing the requirements for

235
00:13:46.871 --> 00:13:49.150
states in the empire to be Catholic. Instead,

236
00:13:49.180 --> 00:13:52.950
each territories ruler could choose for themselves whether to be Catholic or

237
00:13:52.951 --> 00:13:57.220
Lutheran and no one else would, but the piece was just a temporary fix,

238
00:13:57.380 --> 00:14:00.820
a quick release of some steam inside individual states.

239
00:14:01.100 --> 00:14:05.340
Pressure was still rising as the growing popularity of Protestantism collided

240
00:14:05.341 --> 00:14:09.380
with the often Catholic elite in Bohemia, the Catholic root of the second.

241
00:14:09.660 --> 00:14:13.940
It tried to solve this by signing the letter of magistrate and attempt to

242
00:14:13.941 --> 00:14:18.290
compromise. It allowed Bohemia Nobles to build their own churches and worship.

243
00:14:18.810 --> 00:14:19.491
However, they wished,

244
00:14:19.491 --> 00:14:23.450
unfortunately it was this very act of compromise that would ensure the pressure

245
00:14:23.451 --> 00:14:27.010
cooker of Europe finally exploded into the 30 years war.

246
00:14:27.410 --> 00:14:30.610
Martha Kepler really noticed any of this as the new decade dawned,

247
00:14:30.611 --> 00:14:34.850
he was still beavering away in Prague, still making discoveries in 16, 10,

248
00:14:34.870 --> 00:14:39.160
for example, Galle AO used the first telescope to discover Jupiter's moons, IO,

249
00:14:39.161 --> 00:14:43.040
Calisto, Europa, and G meat. Now known as the Galilean moons.

250
00:14:43.090 --> 00:14:46.840
Their existence was such a controversial discovery that most people simply

251
00:14:47.600 --> 00:14:51.320
refused to believe it claiming the telescope must be causing optical illusions.

252
00:14:51.540 --> 00:14:54.440
So Kepler sat down and wrote another book on optics,

253
00:14:54.441 --> 00:14:57.240
which not only proved Galileo, couldn't be seeing things,

254
00:14:57.460 --> 00:15:01.200
but also described how to build a vastly more powerful telescope.

255
00:15:01.340 --> 00:15:04.800
If it's starting to sound as if Kepler could do just about anything he put his

256
00:15:04.801 --> 00:15:08.880
mind do well. Yeah, haven't heard the half of it. The following winter, 16, 11,

257
00:15:08.881 --> 00:15:12.150
he was inspired to do a short study of snowflakes.

258
00:15:12.490 --> 00:15:15.630
Not only did he become the first person in history to observe that all

259
00:15:15.631 --> 00:15:16.710
snowflakes are unique,

260
00:15:16.930 --> 00:15:20.750
the resulting pamphlet has been called the earliest work on crystalography.

261
00:15:20.810 --> 00:15:23.790
And if you are feeling like an under retriever right now, well,

262
00:15:23.791 --> 00:15:27.710
you're not alone &lt;laugh&gt; but even as Kepler kept churning out discovery after

263
00:15:27.711 --> 00:15:30.710
discovery, storm clouds were gathering on the horizon.

264
00:15:31.320 --> 00:15:34.580
The same year that Kepler was writing about snowflakes Rudolph's younger brother

265
00:15:35.220 --> 00:15:38.980
Mateus forced the emperor to abdicate at sword point from the moment he took the

266
00:15:38.981 --> 00:15:39.240
throne,

267
00:15:39.240 --> 00:15:43.020
the hardcore Catholic Matt Mateus made it clear that he wasn't going to honor

268
00:15:43.200 --> 00:15:46.020
any letters, giving legal rights to Protestant scum.

269
00:15:46.140 --> 00:15:49.660
Suddenly the Lutheran Kepler was living in a city that officially hated

270
00:15:49.661 --> 00:15:54.170
Lutherans. It was grants two point do. And once again, Kepler had no way out.

271
00:15:54.650 --> 00:15:55.810
As 16, 12 got underway.

272
00:15:56.170 --> 00:15:58.650
Keer began searching frantically for an exit from Prague.

273
00:15:58.750 --> 00:16:01.730
He wrote again to his old university, but they were like, dude,

274
00:16:01.990 --> 00:16:05.930
you wrote that the earth orbits the sun. That's crazy. If we hire you,

275
00:16:05.931 --> 00:16:09.250
people are gonna think we are crazy, right? If that wasn't bad enough,

276
00:16:09.360 --> 00:16:11.890
that same year Kepler's wife died of spotted fever.

277
00:16:12.070 --> 00:16:15.920
Justice Kepler was getting desperate. The city of ly came to his rescue.

278
00:16:16.230 --> 00:16:20.160
They would create the position of district mathematician just for him provided.

279
00:16:20.161 --> 00:16:24.440
He used his time in the city to finish Bri's tables with no other options,

280
00:16:24.980 --> 00:16:29.120
Kepler accept it. He got out just in time. Five years later in 16,

281
00:16:29.480 --> 00:16:34.190
17 Prague cracked down hard on its Protestants. Judges opened under Rudolph.

282
00:16:34.310 --> 00:16:38.550
The second were closed. non-Catholics were subjected to harassment for a year.

283
00:16:38.770 --> 00:16:42.950
The Protestants tried to put up with these indignities. Then in 16, 18,

284
00:16:43.380 --> 00:16:48.110
they finally snapped on may the 23rd group of Protestants stormed Prue castle

285
00:16:48.180 --> 00:16:51.150
grabbed three Catholics and hold them out of a high window.

286
00:16:51.530 --> 00:16:55.020
The deepest of Prague in is famous today. Novo's death toll,

287
00:16:55.040 --> 00:16:58.340
all three Catholics survived after landing in a pile of manure,

288
00:16:58.680 --> 00:17:00.620
but it's famous for what it started.

289
00:17:00.920 --> 00:17:03.860
The deepen was the opening salvo in the 30 years,

290
00:17:04.040 --> 00:17:08.740
war three decades of religious violence that would destroy central Europe and

291
00:17:08.741 --> 00:17:11.340
leave over 8 million people dead.

292
00:17:11.900 --> 00:17:15.450
And Johans Kepler was about to get a court right in the middle of it.

293
00:17:21.700 --> 00:17:23.840
If we were to try and explain the 30 years war,

294
00:17:23.841 --> 00:17:28.840
it would take about well 30 years and leave us all with really sore brains to

295
00:17:28.841 --> 00:17:29.960
put it in its crudes terms.

296
00:17:30.070 --> 00:17:33.960
Just note that it was a religious war that quickly grew beyond religion and

297
00:17:33.961 --> 00:17:37.070
would ultimately not just the many states of the holy Roman empire,

298
00:17:37.090 --> 00:17:41.310
but also France, Spain, Sweden, the Netherlands Polands, the Ottoman empire,

299
00:17:41.330 --> 00:17:43.270
the Habsburg lands, England, Scotland, Russia,

300
00:17:43.550 --> 00:17:47.390
and pretty much any nation that happened to be passing by and felt like joining

301
00:17:47.490 --> 00:17:50.480
in the Royal rumble. Now when, because the war was so big,

302
00:17:50.540 --> 00:17:51.480
so long and so vicious,

303
00:17:51.580 --> 00:17:55.920
it also created the ideal conditions for the outbreak of a plague,

304
00:17:55.921 --> 00:17:59.600
which in turn created the ideal conditions for witchcraft panics,

305
00:17:59.601 --> 00:18:04.040
which in turn led to some of the largest mass executions for witchcraft in human

306
00:18:04.041 --> 00:18:05.800
history. So yeah, 30 years war,

307
00:18:05.860 --> 00:18:09.510
not exactly a fun time to be alive in central sadly though,

308
00:18:09.511 --> 00:18:12.790
central Europe was exactly where Kepler was by 16,

309
00:18:12.990 --> 00:18:17.790
19 Linz like grads and Prague before it was paralyzed by anti Protestant riots.

310
00:18:18.010 --> 00:18:19.030
As a guest of the city,

311
00:18:19.031 --> 00:18:22.750
Kepler was allowed to stay and he and his new family had married local last

312
00:18:22.751 --> 00:18:26.670
Susan rooting us soon after arriving in 16, 13, and now they had three children.

313
00:18:27.060 --> 00:18:30.620
They were officially protected, but unofficially unofficially,

314
00:18:30.621 --> 00:18:34.460
the family had to deal with prejudice every single day in such circumstances.

315
00:18:34.570 --> 00:18:38.300
It's almost a wonder that Kepler got any work done at all yet.

316
00:18:38.301 --> 00:18:41.780
Somehow he managed that same year. Kepler published his third law,

317
00:18:41.781 --> 00:18:45.260
which states that squaring the length of any planets orbits. In other words,

318
00:18:45.360 --> 00:18:50.290
the length of its year and dividing that by its distance from the sun hub will

319
00:18:50.350 --> 00:18:54.050
return a constant number. It was a powerful mathematical insight,

320
00:18:54.110 --> 00:18:57.770
but it was also overshadowed by events in Kepler's life.

321
00:18:58.170 --> 00:19:00.690
Remember the book Somon that Kepler published back in 60 0 8,

322
00:19:00.750 --> 00:19:03.330
the one we said might be their first work of science fiction,

323
00:19:03.730 --> 00:19:07.610
where we didn't mention it at the time, but Somon includes a little side story.

324
00:19:08.010 --> 00:19:12.160
One about a son who is a scientist and a mother who is a witch in 16,

325
00:19:12.161 --> 00:19:16.880
20 life began imitating Kepler's art in the darkest possible way

326
00:19:17.110 --> 00:19:21.680
that year Kepler's own mother was imprison for witchcraft witchcraft accusations

327
00:19:21.681 --> 00:19:25.360
during the 30 years war, certainly not something to be taken lightly.

328
00:19:25.470 --> 00:19:27.960
This was the same era as the worst Berg witch trials,

329
00:19:28.020 --> 00:19:32.230
in which hundreds of people were burned at the Kepler knew he had to save his

330
00:19:32.231 --> 00:19:32.490
mother.

331
00:19:32.490 --> 00:19:36.510
So he dropped what he was doing and returns at once to organize that defense,

332
00:19:36.810 --> 00:19:39.670
the resulting trial would eat up over a year of his life.

333
00:19:39.850 --> 00:19:42.910
To hear the story now is actually all sorts of impressive.

334
00:19:43.510 --> 00:19:45.670
Kepler approached the case like he did as scientific work,

335
00:19:45.671 --> 00:19:49.390
using a deep analysis of the raw documents to forensically examine.

336
00:19:49.410 --> 00:19:53.660
The prosecution's claims is a battle between science and superstition,

337
00:19:53.740 --> 00:19:56.500
a case in which one side used rational arguments.

338
00:19:56.550 --> 00:20:00.660
While the other talked about demons and women turning themselves into cats,

339
00:20:01.420 --> 00:20:05.540
incredibly science actually won after 14 months manacled in her cell.

340
00:20:05.740 --> 00:20:08.820
The threat of torture looming over her capital's mother was set free.

341
00:20:08.920 --> 00:20:12.970
Thanks entirely to our son's efforts for a, for rationality.

342
00:20:13.240 --> 00:20:17.890
This was a huge victory, but it was one that came at a price for over a year.

343
00:20:18.330 --> 00:20:19.850
Keer scientific work had been put on hold.

344
00:20:20.030 --> 00:20:22.930
The trial had also left him in dire need of money, money.

345
00:20:23.030 --> 00:20:27.010
The city of Lynns wasn't willing to pay not long after the trial ended Kepler's

346
00:20:27.011 --> 00:20:31.330
Lynn's home was requisitions and turned into a troop Garrison in 1625,

347
00:20:31.331 --> 00:20:32.360
the Catholics were running.

348
00:20:32.361 --> 00:20:36.080
The city confiscated his entire library and forced his children to start

349
00:20:36.081 --> 00:20:39.920
attending mass. Finally in 1626, Kepler and his family,

350
00:20:40.190 --> 00:20:42.880
they left Blands for good, but now they were broke.

351
00:20:43.200 --> 00:20:44.840
And on the verge of destitution ever,

352
00:20:44.841 --> 00:20:48.280
the optimist Kepler tried heading back to Prague and asking the treasury for

353
00:20:48.340 --> 00:20:51.120
unpaid wages that Rud off the second at OIN,

354
00:20:51.520 --> 00:20:54.400
that they simply laughed him outta the city. It was a bleak time,

355
00:20:54.500 --> 00:20:56.560
not just for Kepler, but for the whole of Europe,

356
00:20:56.780 --> 00:20:58.680
but the astronomer wasn't done yet.

357
00:20:58.900 --> 00:21:01.840
He still had one last moment of greatness to come.

358
00:21:08.170 --> 00:21:13.150
It had been 1599 when Rudolph II first called Brahe to his court to prepare new

359
00:21:13.430 --> 00:21:14.430
astronomical tables.

360
00:21:14.540 --> 00:21:18.830
This was years before Kepler described his three laws years before his discovery

361
00:21:18.890 --> 00:21:23.830
of Mars' orbit before the defen of Prague before the 30 years war in that

362
00:21:23.831 --> 00:21:27.860
time, bra and Rudolph had both died and the consonant had split apart,

363
00:21:28.380 --> 00:21:30.260
but Kepler hadn't forgotten what he was meant to be doing.

364
00:21:30.320 --> 00:21:34.780
He hadn't forgotten the promise that he had made so long ago in 1627,

365
00:21:35.300 --> 00:21:36.780
Kepler finally published bris,

366
00:21:36.980 --> 00:21:39.500
finished tables known today as the Rudolph tables,

367
00:21:39.501 --> 00:21:43.140
they were the most accurate tables for predicting the movement of the planets in

368
00:21:43.141 --> 00:21:46.980
human history. They were based not just on bras, jealously guarded data,

369
00:21:47.080 --> 00:21:50.170
but also on Kepler's own observations. In fact,

370
00:21:50.171 --> 00:21:52.410
his three laws were baked into the tables.

371
00:21:52.411 --> 00:21:56.290
Underlying every calculation that Kepler had performed, if his laws were real,

372
00:21:56.390 --> 00:21:58.610
the predictions in the tables would be born out.

373
00:21:58.670 --> 00:22:02.170
And luckily there was a major one coming up that everyone could check them

374
00:22:02.171 --> 00:22:06.490
against. In 1631, mercury was scheduled to transit across the sun.

375
00:22:06.740 --> 00:22:07.690
Sadly for our story,

376
00:22:08.160 --> 00:22:11.720
wouldn't live to see himself vindicated on November the 15th, 16,

377
00:22:11.721 --> 00:22:16.480
30 Ahan Keer passed away in the city of Regensburg around in the 30 years,

378
00:22:16.540 --> 00:22:20.760
war continued to rage a pointless. How of destruction consuming Europe,

379
00:22:21.110 --> 00:22:23.960
even in death, Kepler wouldn't escape it. At some point,

380
00:22:24.120 --> 00:22:26.080
a rampaging army destroyed the cemetery.

381
00:22:26.081 --> 00:22:29.550
He was buried in the location of his body. It's now lost to history,

382
00:22:29.770 --> 00:22:31.470
but even as Europe to itself apart,

383
00:22:31.570 --> 00:22:35.230
the first Ray of hope were beginning to glimmer in 1631,

384
00:22:35.231 --> 00:22:37.430
mercury completed its transit across the sun.

385
00:22:37.431 --> 00:22:41.870
Exactly as Keplers tables had predicted with Kepler's work clearly on the mark,

386
00:22:42.050 --> 00:22:43.470
it started raising questions.

387
00:22:43.610 --> 00:22:46.070
One of which would eventually come to greatly trouble,

388
00:22:46.510 --> 00:22:50.580
a young British man about 50 years later, long after the 30 years war,

389
00:22:50.740 --> 00:22:54.660
it finally ended. Isaac Newton found himself pondering capitalist tables.

390
00:22:54.920 --> 00:22:58.140
If it were possible to predict the movements of the planet. So accurately,

391
00:22:58.190 --> 00:23:00.660
there must be some sort of force guiding them.

392
00:23:00.800 --> 00:23:03.740
Newton disagreed with capitalist theory about a magnetic son.

393
00:23:03.760 --> 00:23:08.220
So he said about discovering just what this mysterious force might be from.

394
00:23:08.221 --> 00:23:11.090
These musings would come. The discovery of gravity,

395
00:23:11.610 --> 00:23:15.210
a wild is influence on Newton. Maybe Kepler's biggest claims of fame.

396
00:23:15.340 --> 00:23:17.730
There are other ways that his work lasted.

397
00:23:17.880 --> 00:23:20.530
Just take a look at Kepler's conjecture, a 16,

398
00:23:20.531 --> 00:23:25.530
11 theory on the stacking of cannonballs that wasn't proved until 1998,

399
00:23:25.830 --> 00:23:27.330
nearly 400 years later.

400
00:23:27.630 --> 00:23:31.600
But perhaps the most important aspect of Kepler work is the thinking that

401
00:23:31.640 --> 00:23:32.480
underlay it all.

402
00:23:32.660 --> 00:23:36.880
Kepler was one of the first to look at the night sky and not see some unknowable

403
00:23:36.881 --> 00:23:37.840
mechanism at work,

404
00:23:37.980 --> 00:23:42.760
but a divine plan that was both beautiful and capable of being understood by

405
00:23:42.761 --> 00:23:43.594
humans.

406
00:23:43.760 --> 00:23:47.440
While Kepler may have been more explicitly religious than most scientists today,

407
00:23:47.460 --> 00:23:50.760
he even actually referred to himself as a prophet. At one point,

408
00:23:51.030 --> 00:23:55.280
that idea of a universal language of an existence we can understand through

409
00:23:55.281 --> 00:23:57.480
mathematics is still very relevant.

410
00:23:58.320 --> 00:24:01.480
Kepler may have died before he could see his life's work be proved, right,

411
00:24:01.500 --> 00:24:06.310
but his name will continue to echo across for centuries to come.

412
00:24:06.650 --> 00:24:08.950

Do not forget to subscribe brand new videos four days a week. Also.

415
00:24:14.650 --> 00:24:17.870
Why not check out another channel? I do. It's called highlight history.

416
00:24:17.871 --> 00:24:20.590
It's sort of a today in history thing. I'm gonna link to that below.

417
00:24:21.310 --> 00:24:22.990
There's always. Thank you for watching.
