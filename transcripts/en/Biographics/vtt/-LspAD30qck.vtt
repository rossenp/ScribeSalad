00:00:00.090 --> 00:00:04.950
<v 0>It was new year's Eve December the 31st 192 80 competence started the day</v>

2
00:00:04.951 --> 00:00:05.880
as Roman emperor,

3
00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:10.260
but he fell to an assassination plot orchestrated by his mistress. Masia first.

4
00:00:10.261 --> 00:00:12.690
She tried poisoning him, but because he was already drunk,

5
00:00:13.110 --> 00:00:15.900
comidas quickly fell out and vomited the toxin before it could take effect,

6
00:00:16.050 --> 00:00:20.430
then Masia resulted to less subtle methods is she simply sent a wrestler into

7
00:00:20.431 --> 00:00:23.310
the embers chambers to strangle him. Comatose was dead.

8
00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:27.840
And so within was the nother and denied dynasty as he had no children of his own

9
00:00:28.110 --> 00:00:29.490
lands, never adopted any heirs.

10
00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:32.250
The question now was who would become the new emperor.

11
00:00:32.280 --> 00:00:34.380
This would not be an easy thing to answer. In fact,

12
00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:38.160
the collapse of another ans nine dynasty plunged the Roman empire into the most

13
00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:41.700
turbulent period of its history. So far in 193,

14
00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:44.940
85 men would vie for power and in one way or another,

15
00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:49.380
each one of them would lay claim to the Roman throne eventually after betrayals

16
00:00:49.560 --> 00:00:53.490
conspiracies, and just fascinations, only one would emerge triumphant,

17
00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:55.410
ready to forge his own dynasty.

18
00:00:55.440 --> 00:00:59.280
Following the chaos known as the year of the five emperors.

19
00:01:05.870 --> 00:01:06.703
<v 1>Um.</v>

20
00:01:11.810 --> 00:01:12.710
<v 0>Some communists have perished.</v>

21
00:01:12.711 --> 00:01:14.780
He had made sworn enemies out of the Roman Senate.

22
00:01:14.930 --> 00:01:16.700
Therefore they immediately went to work.

23
00:01:16.701 --> 00:01:20.060
I'm doing many of the changes he had brought on and even had him declared a

24
00:01:20.061 --> 00:01:23.900
public enemy of Rome. They realized that news of his demise would create chaos.

25
00:01:23.901 --> 00:01:27.320
So they kept his death a secret until they already have someone lined up to

26
00:01:27.321 --> 00:01:31.310
follow him as emperor that someone with pattern ax, according to the Astoria,

27
00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:33.490
Augusta and Cassius DEO person,

28
00:01:33.500 --> 00:01:36.530
X was born in Alba Pompeia in 126,

29
00:01:36.531 --> 00:01:39.410
eight D it did not come from a noble family as his father.

30
00:01:39.890 --> 00:01:41.630
Olivia successes was a freed man,

31
00:01:41.660 --> 00:01:45.230
meaning a former slave who had gained his freedom, personal acts, received idea,

32
00:01:45.231 --> 00:01:48.200
motorist education, and originally intended to become a teacher,

33
00:01:48.230 --> 00:01:51.650
but found that military life was more to his liking with the help of a family,

34
00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:52.970
friends who was a former console.

35
00:01:52.970 --> 00:01:55.790
He obtained a position as a cohort prefect in Syria,

36
00:01:55.880 --> 00:01:58.760
as the years went by pass the next steadily Rose through the ranks,

37
00:01:58.761 --> 00:02:03.110
especially after distinguished himself in the Patheon war during the reigns of

38
00:02:03.860 --> 00:02:08.090
Antonia's pass. And Mark's a rebellious person. X spent decades in the military,

39
00:02:08.091 --> 00:02:12.230
moving from Syria to Britain, then maritia to Daisha.

40
00:02:12.320 --> 00:02:14.930
He became a trusted aid of Claudia's bomb bareness.

41
00:02:14.931 --> 00:02:19.160
One of the most important commanders under Marcus Aurelius and for his efforts,

42
00:02:19.161 --> 00:02:22.790
it was granted several governorships and to console ship before being finally

43
00:02:22.850 --> 00:02:25.160
assigned to the Senate. And when communists was dead,

44
00:02:25.580 --> 00:02:29.180
two men who had been involved in his assassination electors and latest

45
00:02:29.360 --> 00:02:31.460
concluded, the person acts had the rank,

46
00:02:31.670 --> 00:02:34.880
the experience and the popularity to become the new emperor.

47
00:02:34.970 --> 00:02:38.510
When he was told of this person acts first sends a companion to see the body of

48
00:02:38.511 --> 00:02:39.800
the former emperor. Indeed,

49
00:02:39.801 --> 00:02:42.350
the reign of kilometers that made a lot of men paranoid,

50
00:02:42.530 --> 00:02:46.040
and they feared that something like this could be a test that might end in their

51
00:02:46.041 --> 00:02:48.080
execution offer. He was convinced of the truth.

52
00:02:48.620 --> 00:02:51.020
Pasternack's went to the Praetorian barracks to get them on his site.

53
00:02:51.080 --> 00:02:54.530
Basically he told them that communists died of natural causes and promised them

54
00:02:54.531 --> 00:02:56.330
a money gift called a donate of them.

55
00:02:56.510 --> 00:02:59.380
So they would support is essential to the throne. Finally,

56
00:02:59.381 --> 00:03:02.650
he went to the Senate where he stated his case, but also offered to step down.

57
00:03:02.651 --> 00:03:06.280
If someone younger Angeles feeble than him was more suitable for the job,

58
00:03:06.500 --> 00:03:07.031
I don't really,

59
00:03:07.031 --> 00:03:09.970
it was this modesty and his practice accountancy that convinced the Senate,

60
00:03:10.300 --> 00:03:14.890
that patent acts was the best candidate. So on January, the first 193 Ady,

61
00:03:15.010 --> 00:03:16.860
he was crowned the new Roman emperor.

62
00:03:16.940 --> 00:03:20.800
The people of Rome seemed pleased at this developments as they Johns or the name

63
00:03:20.801 --> 00:03:23.350
pattern acts and slung, insults, communists,

64
00:03:23.560 --> 00:03:25.810
and angry mobiles demanded the former emperor, his body.

65
00:03:25.811 --> 00:03:28.330
So they could drag it through the streets and tear it to pieces.

66
00:03:28.330 --> 00:03:30.220
But as it had already been in touch,

67
00:03:30.240 --> 00:03:34.300
they have to set that smashing up the statues of communists by all accounts,

68
00:03:34.301 --> 00:03:35.920
Pasinex trying to be a good ruler.

69
00:03:35.950 --> 00:03:39.820
Cassius dos said that he showed humaneness and integrity and capital

70
00:03:39.821 --> 00:03:43.600
consideration for the public welfare. He also wanted a more democratic reign,

71
00:03:43.610 --> 00:03:46.090
so he refused fancy complicated titles.

72
00:03:46.091 --> 00:03:48.690
And instead stalled himself as chief of the Senate,

73
00:03:48.700 --> 00:03:52.990
a very old position from before the days of the empire unsurprisingly person.

74
00:03:53.200 --> 00:03:54.130
Next continued reversing.

75
00:03:54.131 --> 00:03:58.180
Many of the policies instituted by commerce and was more in line with Marcus

76
00:03:58.181 --> 00:04:01.480
Aurelius bends. Of course, this has gotten killed.

77
00:04:01.720 --> 00:04:02.770
It won't surprise you to learn.

78
00:04:02.771 --> 00:04:05.380
The pattern acts did not have a long reign after all.

79
00:04:05.381 --> 00:04:07.900
We're going to go through five of them in a single yet.

80
00:04:08.020 --> 00:04:10.720
His biggest mistake was angering. The Praetorian God,

81
00:04:10.780 --> 00:04:14.710
technically they were meant to be an elite units of Rome's greatest soldiers who

82
00:04:14.711 --> 00:04:18.220
acted as bodyguards and intelligence officers for the emperor. In reality,

83
00:04:18.221 --> 00:04:18.971
though, they will.

84
00:04:18.971 --> 00:04:23.440
One of the Empire's most corrupt institutions as the defacto armed forces inside

85
00:04:23.441 --> 00:04:24.280
the city of Rome,

86
00:04:24.430 --> 00:04:28.330
they knew that their support was important for an emperor and regularly bargains

87
00:04:28.331 --> 00:04:31.960
their position into obtaining more money, power, and privileges.

88
00:04:32.050 --> 00:04:35.080
It was not uncommon for the guard to turn against an Ambra once they felt that

89
00:04:35.081 --> 00:04:36.160
it was time for a change,

90
00:04:36.161 --> 00:04:39.990
or if they believe that a newcomer would be better suited to their interests as

91
00:04:39.991 --> 00:04:40.421
soon enough,

92
00:04:40.421 --> 00:04:44.620
the Praetorian guard were about to commit to the most heinous acts of their 300

93
00:04:44.621 --> 00:04:45.454
year existence,

94
00:04:45.640 --> 00:04:48.400
because Coleman has didn't really counter about reading Ram effectively.

95
00:04:48.401 --> 00:04:51.070
And because he already had plenty of other enemies to worry about,

96
00:04:51.220 --> 00:04:54.880
he made sure to always be on the good side of the Praetorian guard,

97
00:04:55.030 --> 00:04:55.751
like granting them.

98
00:04:55.751 --> 00:05:00.130
A lot of concessions person acts on the other hand was a strict and disciplined

99
00:05:00.131 --> 00:05:03.550
military man and intended to reform the God by curtailing the loss of its

100
00:05:03.551 --> 00:05:06.610
privileges applause against him was almost inevitable. In fact,

101
00:05:06.611 --> 00:05:07.660
he survived the first one,

102
00:05:08.140 --> 00:05:11.560
uncovering a conspiracy to use up the throne and replace him with a console

103
00:05:11.590 --> 00:05:16.030
named Foucault afterwards around 200 to 300 soldiers of the Praetorian God

104
00:05:16.031 --> 00:05:18.520
simply storms the palace. They struck out an ax down,

105
00:05:18.670 --> 00:05:21.370
cut off his head and placed it on a spear. It was last ending,

106
00:05:21.520 --> 00:05:23.110
his reign after 87 days.

107
00:05:29.910 --> 00:05:30.743
<v 2>That's where it spread through.</v>

108
00:05:31.170 --> 00:05:33.330
<v 0>Rome of what the Praetorian guard did to protect acts.</v>

109
00:05:33.360 --> 00:05:36.870
Most city officials rans hide in their homes. One of them, however,

110
00:05:37.020 --> 00:05:39.870
they immediately saw the opportunity placed in front of him and realized that

111
00:05:39.871 --> 00:05:44.160
the throne was up for grabs. That man was a pre-con soul named Didier Juliana's.

112
00:05:44.190 --> 00:05:45.930
He made his way to the Praetorian barracks,

113
00:05:45.931 --> 00:05:49.530
but wasn't allowed inside the cabins was shocked to discover that somebody else

114
00:05:49.531 --> 00:05:51.930
had the same idea as the prefect of Rome,

115
00:05:52.140 --> 00:05:57.030
Titus Flavius Silva Kianna's as not only the prefects, but also pattern axes.

116
00:05:58.280 --> 00:06:02.180
SELPA Kianna's originally went to the camp to try and smooth over the situation

117
00:06:02.181 --> 00:06:05.750
with the Praetorians. This was before person acts had been assassinated,

118
00:06:05.751 --> 00:06:07.460
but once he learns of the emperor, his demise,

119
00:06:07.640 --> 00:06:09.770
he thought he might as well make a play for the throne.

120
00:06:09.800 --> 00:06:13.190
So he offered the same people who had just murdered his son in Laura money gift.

121
00:06:13.190 --> 00:06:16.370
If they would support as essential as the new emperor, Juliana's heard this.

122
00:06:16.371 --> 00:06:18.680
And even though we had not been allowed in sunny, the camp,

123
00:06:18.770 --> 00:06:21.260
he shouted at the soldiers that he would make them a better off up.

124
00:06:21.290 --> 00:06:24.080
Now the Praetorian God understood the situation in front of them.

125
00:06:24.081 --> 00:06:27.320
So they proceeded to start a bidding war between the two officials.

126
00:06:27.350 --> 00:06:29.510
But when Cassius DEO told the story,

127
00:06:29.511 --> 00:06:31.760
since he was actually a Senator in Rome at the time,

128
00:06:31.850 --> 00:06:36.710
then ensued a most disgraceful business and one unworthy of Rome for just as

129
00:06:36.711 --> 00:06:39.110
if it had been in some market or auction room,

130
00:06:39.260 --> 00:06:43.610
both a city and its entire empire auctioned off the settlers were the ones who

131
00:06:43.730 --> 00:06:44.930
would slay in their emperor.

132
00:06:44.931 --> 00:06:48.860
And there would be buyers where Suffolk Yannis and Juliana's who've.

133
00:06:48.861 --> 00:06:52.910
I do outbid each other one from the inside, the other, from the outside,

134
00:06:52.940 --> 00:06:56.450
they gradually raised their bids up to 20,000, says to seize per soldier,

135
00:06:56.510 --> 00:07:00.320
some of the soldiers would carry words. Juliana's Slovakian this office so much.

136
00:07:00.620 --> 00:07:02.210
How much more do you make it?

137
00:07:02.600 --> 00:07:06.260
And to Suffolk Yonas and 10 Giuliani's promises so much,

138
00:07:06.530 --> 00:07:08.540
how much do you raise him in the end? Did he,

139
00:07:08.720 --> 00:07:11.750
as Juliana's offer 25,000 says to seize per soldier,

140
00:07:11.751 --> 00:07:16.220
which roughly means around 65,000 to $75,000 in modern currency.

141
00:07:16.280 --> 00:07:19.370
He also argued that if [inaudible] were to become emperor,

142
00:07:19.610 --> 00:07:22.430
he might attempt to avenge person axes death.

143
00:07:22.490 --> 00:07:25.940
This also was enough to sway the Praetorian guard who decided to make Diddy as

144
00:07:26.660 --> 00:07:29.480
Juliana's the new emperor of Rome later, that same night,

145
00:07:29.510 --> 00:07:32.750
really honest rode through the streets of Rome with the guard by his side,

146
00:07:32.900 --> 00:07:36.800
weapons out and standards held high as they made their way to the forum.

147
00:07:36.801 --> 00:07:38.240
And then to the Senate house,

148
00:07:38.300 --> 00:07:41.120
this was an intimidation tactic and it sent a clear message.

149
00:07:41.420 --> 00:07:42.740
The Praetorian guard supported.

150
00:07:42.890 --> 00:07:47.360
Did he as Julianas and anyone who opposed him would have to deal with them going

151
00:07:47.361 --> 00:07:50.120
back to dos accounts, who again was a Senator at the time,

152
00:07:50.270 --> 00:07:54.830
he said there was a genuine fear among his peers Juliana's has called upon them

153
00:07:54.831 --> 00:07:57.590
to come to the Senate house and confirm his emperor ship.

154
00:07:57.830 --> 00:08:01.310
But they were worried that those who had been friends of pattern acts or enemies

155
00:08:01.311 --> 00:08:05.420
of Juliana's would simply be put to death. Indeed, Cassius DEO was both yet.

156
00:08:05.570 --> 00:08:07.820
Then granted a prayer to our ship by a pattern acts.

157
00:08:07.970 --> 00:08:10.400
And I'd also accused Juliana's of several offenses,

158
00:08:10.460 --> 00:08:13.820
but that was also concerned that those who skipped the meeting would simply be

159
00:08:13.821 --> 00:08:16.730
hunted down in their homes. So with a lot of trepidation,

160
00:08:16.731 --> 00:08:18.500
the senators made the waves of the meeting place,

161
00:08:18.740 --> 00:08:22.340
genuinely not knowing if they would be leaving the Senate alive that night.

162
00:08:22.490 --> 00:08:25.310
But again, let's hear from the firsthand accounts of the man who was that.

163
00:08:25.580 --> 00:08:29.150
So when Boff and dinner were over, we pushed our way through the soldiers,

164
00:08:29.151 --> 00:08:32.540
entered the Senate house and heard them deliver a speech that was quite worthy

165
00:08:32.541 --> 00:08:35.450
of him. And the course of which he said, I see that you need to reload,

166
00:08:35.451 --> 00:08:38.780
runs I myself and best fitters of any two rule.

167
00:08:38.780 --> 00:08:41.690
You should mention all the advantages I can offer.

168
00:08:41.930 --> 00:08:45.710
If you are not already familiar with them and had not already had experience of

169
00:08:45.711 --> 00:08:50.300
me, consequently, I have not even asked to be attended here by many soldiers,

170
00:08:50.330 --> 00:08:54.590
but have come to you alone in order that he may ratify what has been given to me

171
00:08:54.770 --> 00:08:57.660
by them. I'm here alone is what he said, though.

172
00:08:57.930 --> 00:09:00.900
You'd actually surrounded the entire Senate house outside with heavily armed

173
00:09:00.930 --> 00:09:04.380
troops and a large number of soldiers in the chamber itself. Moreover,

174
00:09:04.410 --> 00:09:08.550
he reminded us if our knowledge of the kind of man he was in consequence of

175
00:09:08.551 --> 00:09:11.760
which we both feared and hated him with no other choice.

176
00:09:11.761 --> 00:09:14.940
The Senate confirms did. He, as Juliana's says, the emperor of Romans,

177
00:09:15.210 --> 00:09:16.290
he went to the palace that night,

178
00:09:16.320 --> 00:09:19.110
where he had a feast and celebrated with games and music.

179
00:09:19.111 --> 00:09:21.720
While the copes of his predecessor still lay on the palace floor.

180
00:09:21.750 --> 00:09:25.170
The next day arrived, broke out as the people of our own firmly rejected,

181
00:09:25.171 --> 00:09:27.210
really honest as a legitimate emperor. However,

182
00:09:27.211 --> 00:09:29.820
they stood no chance against the Praetorian garden.

183
00:09:29.950 --> 00:09:31.820
And he was slain in the clashes that followed.

184
00:09:31.880 --> 00:09:32.713
<v 2>Right.</v>

185
00:09:38.300 --> 00:09:42.410
<v 0>By buying the loyalty of the Praetorian guards Juliana's might have had a firm</v>

186
00:09:42.411 --> 00:09:43.071
grip on Rome,

187
00:09:43.071 --> 00:09:46.220
but the Roman empire was much bigger than just one city and to the God who

188
00:09:46.221 --> 00:09:48.410
might've been fed by sentences and common citizens.

189
00:09:48.440 --> 00:09:50.150
But what about an actual army?

190
00:09:50.180 --> 00:09:53.480
What about Rome's greatest generals who commanded the loyalty of their soldiers,

191
00:09:53.510 --> 00:09:56.480
volleyball and whomever was sitting in the Roman palace.

192
00:09:56.510 --> 00:10:00.020
Would they simply roll over and accept Juliana's as their new leader,

193
00:10:00.050 --> 00:10:04.520
especially after a blatant and shameful Ascension that was decried by both

194
00:10:04.550 --> 00:10:08.000
politicians and PBNs alike? Well, no, of course not.

195
00:10:08.030 --> 00:10:11.840
But this was called the a of the five emperors after role. We've had two so far.

196
00:10:11.841 --> 00:10:14.030
So three more were coming well,

197
00:10:14.050 --> 00:10:17.600
unlike person acts and Juliana at SU followed each other in sequence,

198
00:10:17.690 --> 00:10:19.370
the other three made a play for the throne.

199
00:10:19.371 --> 00:10:23.990
At the same time they were presenting this Septimius Severus and Claudius are

200
00:10:24.560 --> 00:10:27.500
Binus. They shared similar circumstances. All three were successful,

201
00:10:27.501 --> 00:10:31.100
respected Roman generals who were popular with the men under their command.

202
00:10:31.190 --> 00:10:33.050
At the time, all of them were serving as governors,

203
00:10:33.590 --> 00:10:37.280
several as in Pannonia Alanis in Britain and Pacino's in Syria,

204
00:10:37.370 --> 00:10:38.750
once word reached them of what did he,

205
00:10:38.840 --> 00:10:43.070
as Juliana's had done them and all recognized them as the new emperor and agreed

206
00:10:43.071 --> 00:10:44.930
to March on Rome on their behalf,

207
00:10:44.990 --> 00:10:48.200
there are three groups that it would be Roman leader has to contend with the

208
00:10:48.201 --> 00:10:51.230
army, the centers and the common people with two hours of three,

209
00:10:51.470 --> 00:10:53.360
there essentially is pretty much a done deal.

210
00:10:53.660 --> 00:10:56.120
Purely has showed us that you can have even just one of them,

211
00:10:56.121 --> 00:10:59.360
then get the second one by force and not care about the third.

212
00:10:59.390 --> 00:11:01.610
But these three generals all have their own armies.

213
00:11:01.611 --> 00:11:04.790
And it's a pretty safe bet that the sentence and the people of Rome would have

214
00:11:04.791 --> 00:11:07.820
preferred any of them over duteous Juliana's. So,

215
00:11:07.821 --> 00:11:09.340
which one would win in the end?

216
00:11:15.320 --> 00:11:16.153
<v 2>[Inaudible].</v>

217
00:11:16.830 --> 00:11:18.770
<v 0>[Inaudible] was born circa 135,</v>

218
00:11:18.830 --> 00:11:22.220
a D in a small town called acronym and provincial Italy.

219
00:11:22.520 --> 00:11:26.030
He came from more modest means compared to his rivals and as part of an

220
00:11:26.031 --> 00:11:28.910
equestrian family, we don't know much about his early career,

221
00:11:29.090 --> 00:11:31.910
but his military record. I want him to rise above his station,

222
00:11:31.911 --> 00:11:35.180
eventually becoming the first member of his family to become a Senator under two

223
00:11:35.181 --> 00:11:38.630
kilometers off to several governorships and console ships throughout the empire.

224
00:11:38.750 --> 00:11:43.010
But sending us ended up in Syria in 191. And by all accounts,

225
00:11:43.011 --> 00:11:46.490
he was well liked by the people in Syria and by the senators back in Rome,

226
00:11:46.640 --> 00:11:49.820
in terms of military supports pretty much the entire middle Eastern section of

227
00:11:49.821 --> 00:11:54.250
the empire was behind him, Syria, Egypt, Jerusalem Arabia, and Kapha dosha.

228
00:11:54.310 --> 00:11:55.390
If the Romans had it their way,

229
00:11:55.391 --> 00:11:57.370
it would seem that they would have probably wants a sentience to be.

230
00:11:57.370 --> 00:11:59.110
Then you emperor, according to DEO,

231
00:11:59.230 --> 00:12:03.130
it was his name that the citizens shouted and praised whenever Juliana's was out

232
00:12:03.131 --> 00:12:04.630
in public, unfortunately for them,

233
00:12:04.750 --> 00:12:07.930
but [inaudible] was the furthest one of all stationed at the Eastern edge of the

234
00:12:07.931 --> 00:12:12.130
Roman empire. The closest one was Septimius Severus. He was in Pannonia.

235
00:12:12.220 --> 00:12:14.260
This was a Roman province right next to Italy,

236
00:12:14.440 --> 00:12:19.420
born in Africa and 145 AED in the ancient port city of leptos Magna Severus was

237
00:12:19.421 --> 00:12:22.540
the son of a Roman mother and to Carthaginian father.

238
00:12:22.630 --> 00:12:25.960
He first traveled to right when he was 18 and began working his way up through

239
00:12:25.961 --> 00:12:27.670
the ranks of the Roman public office,

240
00:12:27.671 --> 00:12:30.970
which was also referred to as the curses sauna room,

241
00:12:31.000 --> 00:12:35.960
this culminated in 191 80 with the governorship of Pannonia also under

242
00:12:36.580 --> 00:12:40.270
[inaudible] DEO described Severus as the shrewdest of the four men fighting for

243
00:12:40.271 --> 00:12:40.930
the throne.

244
00:12:40.930 --> 00:12:44.890
As soon as the art of the death of Patton ACCE made preparations to go to Rome

245
00:12:44.891 --> 00:12:45.940
and become the new emperor.

246
00:12:46.030 --> 00:12:49.510
He got the supportive most of the soldiers in central and Eastern Europe,

247
00:12:49.630 --> 00:12:53.770
while those in Britain goal and the Iberian peninsula well behind Claudius

248
00:12:53.800 --> 00:12:58.720
Albeniz speaking of whom I'll ask contender was born Seneca 147 and possibly

249
00:12:58.721 --> 00:13:03.040
in the African city of [inaudible] located in modern day. Tunisia,

250
00:13:03.070 --> 00:13:06.160
we say possibly because the main source of as his early life,

251
00:13:06.310 --> 00:13:09.730
his history or gusta, which is notoriously unreliable,

252
00:13:09.790 --> 00:13:14.580
like the other two Alvin was made a governor by calmness Septimius Severus

253
00:13:14.581 --> 00:13:16.080
because he was stationed close to Italy.

254
00:13:16.140 --> 00:13:17.970
He was the first to make his way towards Rome.

255
00:13:18.090 --> 00:13:22.050
A calculating man Severus realized that even if he did not take the throne,

256
00:13:22.051 --> 00:13:24.840
he would immediately have two powerful rivals to contend with.

257
00:13:24.870 --> 00:13:28.140
Neither of the other two were likely to give up their claim just because Diddy

258
00:13:28.290 --> 00:13:29.970
Juliana's was no longer emperor.

259
00:13:30.030 --> 00:13:34.770
Therefore he sought out a packed with ominous and he sent a letter where Severus

260
00:13:35.060 --> 00:13:38.160
agreed to recognize him as Caesar. If he were to remain in Britain.

261
00:13:38.190 --> 00:13:41.340
We're not sure exactly if this meant that the two would rule together or if

262
00:13:41.341 --> 00:13:44.160
Severus offered to appoints. The other governor is his ad,

263
00:13:44.161 --> 00:13:48.720
but this was good enough for Albeniz who stayed put the at least for now,

264
00:13:48.810 --> 00:13:50.550
as far as Juliana's was concerned,

265
00:13:50.580 --> 00:13:55.140
he offered little resistance to Septimius Severus first tried to send prefects

266
00:13:55.350 --> 00:13:58.800
into messages to him, either to delay as Von. So to persuade his men,

267
00:13:58.801 --> 00:14:00.150
to abandon him, however,

268
00:14:00.180 --> 00:14:03.360
the opposite happens and more of them ended up siding with Severus.

269
00:14:03.390 --> 00:14:07.530
The general then captured Ravenna runs its fleas without a fight it's most of

270
00:14:07.531 --> 00:14:10.860
the populace he encountered preferred him over Juliana's. According to DEO,

271
00:14:11.190 --> 00:14:14.400
there was one battle between the Praetorians and several of his forces,

272
00:14:14.401 --> 00:14:18.270
but the Praetorians were absolutely crushed and did nothing worthy of their

273
00:14:18.271 --> 00:14:19.950
name. And of that promise.

274
00:14:20.070 --> 00:14:23.130
The historian thinks that this was because the Praetorians had become too

275
00:14:23.131 --> 00:14:26.580
complacent or had learned live delicately as he put it.

276
00:14:26.730 --> 00:14:30.150
They were fine when they threatened old senators or winds up against citizens,

277
00:14:30.151 --> 00:14:34.230
armed with rocks, but got demolished by an actual battle-hardened army.

278
00:14:34.380 --> 00:14:38.250
Other sources say the battle was not even necessary as the Victorians abandoned

279
00:14:38.251 --> 00:14:41.940
Juliana's or masses Severus advanced in a desperate attempt.

280
00:14:41.970 --> 00:14:45.510
Juliana's went to the Senate and asked them to talk to sever so that the two of

281
00:14:45.511 --> 00:14:48.690
them could rule together. Of course, it was far too late for such offers.

282
00:14:48.720 --> 00:14:51.440
One sever sent word to ruin that he would spare the Praetorians.

283
00:14:51.441 --> 00:14:54.500
As long as they surrendered the ones who assassinated Patten acts,

284
00:14:54.770 --> 00:14:58.100
his fate was sealed. The gods arrested Juliana's in terms of over to the Senate,

285
00:14:58.130 --> 00:15:01.100
he was then sentenced to death. Septimius Severus was proclaims.

286
00:15:01.101 --> 00:15:03.560
The new emperor and person acts was dafydd.

287
00:15:03.860 --> 00:15:06.530
Did he S Giuliana was executed on the 1st of June,

288
00:15:06.560 --> 00:15:11.360
193 Ady after just 66 days. His emperor is barely remember today,

289
00:15:11.361 --> 00:15:15.980
but what he did was almost impressive in a way is he managed to become as hated

290
00:15:15.981 --> 00:15:20.810
by the Romans, if not more so, as notorious emperors, like Caligula or Nero.

291
00:15:21.110 --> 00:15:22.580
And he did it in just two months.

292
00:15:28.930 --> 00:15:29.740
<v 2>September.</v>

293
00:15:29.740 --> 00:15:31.540
<v 0>Sever, as well as the new ruler of the Roman empire,</v>

294
00:15:31.570 --> 00:15:34.240
but he still had a few threats to deal with. But starters,

295
00:15:34.340 --> 00:15:36.910
the Praetorians clearly they could not be trusted.

296
00:15:37.120 --> 00:15:38.710
He might've promised to spend their lives,

297
00:15:38.711 --> 00:15:40.480
but that did not mean he could have punish them.

298
00:15:40.540 --> 00:15:44.350
He summons them moulins after chastising them for their actions against Pasinex.

299
00:15:44.650 --> 00:15:48.580
He confiscated their arms and horses and banished them all from Rome now onto

300
00:15:48.581 --> 00:15:50.230
the most serious threat percentile.

301
00:15:50.260 --> 00:15:54.250
So clearly had no intention of giving up his claims at the throne. Fortunately,

302
00:15:54.251 --> 00:15:58.480
for Severus. He also had the weaker army and according to dos, the week of mind,

303
00:15:58.540 --> 00:16:02.830
he was getting too cocky and more puffed up than ever as the historian puts his

304
00:16:02.831 --> 00:16:05.950
and hearing all this stuff about the people challenging his name in the streets

305
00:16:05.951 --> 00:16:10.240
of Raymond's his own soldiers referring to him as the new Alexander went to his

306
00:16:10.630 --> 00:16:12.010
hand, he was a session of victory,

307
00:16:12.040 --> 00:16:14.560
but it was about to have a very rude awakening,

308
00:16:14.710 --> 00:16:17.210
but sending us set up headquarters in Byzantines,

309
00:16:17.290 --> 00:16:19.540
the city deeply loyal to him from them.

310
00:16:19.570 --> 00:16:23.470
He marched his army and met severs in battle for the first time that year at the

311
00:16:23.471 --> 00:16:26.500
city of [inaudible] not only was he defeated,

312
00:16:26.501 --> 00:16:29.710
but one of his most trusted generals, Emily Ana's was slain.

313
00:16:29.800 --> 00:16:33.430
Not surprisingly Severus captured the pressure on after his victory and laid

314
00:16:33.431 --> 00:16:37.660
siege on Byzantium, forcing him to retreat further East. It's a nice app.

315
00:16:38.080 --> 00:16:39.820
Another battle took place there in December,

316
00:16:39.821 --> 00:16:42.580
and it resulted in another triumph Septimius Severus.

317
00:16:42.610 --> 00:16:45.170
But then he has his Imperial dreams starting to shatter.

318
00:16:45.250 --> 00:16:46.960
Not only did he suffer multiple defeats,

319
00:16:46.961 --> 00:16:48.760
but he was beginning to lose supporters.

320
00:16:48.910 --> 00:16:53.170
Some provinces like Egypt and Arabia switched their allegiances to Severus.

321
00:16:53.260 --> 00:16:55.660
One final push was all it would take to finally break him.

322
00:16:55.750 --> 00:16:57.700
It didn't happen until 193,

323
00:16:57.820 --> 00:17:01.480
but it did occur the following year at is this during one last major battle

324
00:17:01.481 --> 00:17:04.480
between the two sides, but sending us not only lost again,

325
00:17:04.660 --> 00:17:07.810
but was captured by the enemy during his retreat, he was headed.

326
00:17:08.020 --> 00:17:10.600
And then several centers had on a pole to buy Santiam,

327
00:17:10.750 --> 00:17:13.960
which was still under siege in an effort to get them to finally abandon their

328
00:17:13.961 --> 00:17:17.710
loyalty to him. It actually took two more years before by Santiam fell.

329
00:17:17.711 --> 00:17:20.410
But once that happened, Severus his position was secured.

330
00:17:20.740 --> 00:17:23.620
That was just one problem left Claudius business.

331
00:17:23.630 --> 00:17:25.780
The last remaining pretended to the throne,

332
00:17:25.870 --> 00:17:28.150
he was proclaimed emperor at the same time as Severus,

333
00:17:28.151 --> 00:17:32.080
but the two of them forged a tenuous Alliance with Albertus accepting the title

334
00:17:32.081 --> 00:17:36.160
of Caesar and ruling over most Western parts of the Ambar while its Severus was

335
00:17:36.161 --> 00:17:38.350
dealing with [inaudible],

336
00:17:38.500 --> 00:17:42.790
but business was fully expecting to one day become and burrow should sever die

337
00:17:42.800 --> 00:17:43.600
before him.

338
00:17:43.600 --> 00:17:46.900
But the latter had no intention of allowing this to happen and probably never

339
00:17:46.901 --> 00:17:50.130
did several sent two sons and he wanted to follow him as emperor,

340
00:17:50.220 --> 00:17:51.800
not Albertus first,

341
00:17:52.200 --> 00:17:55.650
Severus tried using trickery and sent a senescence to Albeniz under the guise of

342
00:17:55.651 --> 00:17:59.010
messengers. They failed. However, and now there was no choice,

343
00:17:59.011 --> 00:18:00.540
but open combat between them.

344
00:18:00.660 --> 00:18:03.780
I want to S began mobilizing his troops in Britain and proclaimed himself,

345
00:18:04.110 --> 00:18:06.120
sole emperor. Well Severus did the same,

346
00:18:06.121 --> 00:18:10.860
except that he named his eldest son as his co emperor and later 196 Ady

347
00:18:11.640 --> 00:18:16.160
Albeniz and his forces crossed into Gaul. [inaudible] February the 19th,

348
00:18:17.010 --> 00:18:21.120
197, a D at the battle of Dunham modern day, Neil France.

349
00:18:21.240 --> 00:18:25.050
This would have been a massive conflict for the time is dimensions that each

350
00:18:25.051 --> 00:18:27.150
side had 150,000 soldiers.

351
00:18:27.270 --> 00:18:30.450
The tide turned several times as neither one dominated the field of battle,

352
00:18:30.451 --> 00:18:34.050
but ultimately Septimius Severus was triumphant. Once more,

353
00:18:34.470 --> 00:18:37.590
Alvin has retreated to look Dunham, but once the war was lost,

354
00:18:37.591 --> 00:18:40.430
he killed himself. Severus took his hands and sent it to Rome,

355
00:18:40.431 --> 00:18:42.240
making it clear that he finally.

356
00:18:42.600 --> 00:18:43.433
<v 2>Supreme.</v>

357
00:18:50.000 --> 00:18:51.020
<v 0>The content is out of the way.</v>

358
00:18:51.050 --> 00:18:55.040
There was nobody left to challenge the authority of Septimius Severus it

359
00:18:55.041 --> 00:18:57.050
might've technically lasted over four years,

360
00:18:57.080 --> 00:19:00.800
but the year of five emperors was finally over and the, and dynasty could begin.

361
00:19:01.100 --> 00:19:04.580
First came a show of dominance is Severus look to punish all of those who showed

362
00:19:04.581 --> 00:19:07.520
support to his enemies, particularly in the Eastern parts of the empire,

363
00:19:07.521 --> 00:19:10.730
which had aligned themselves with Fresenius. There were executions,

364
00:19:10.880 --> 00:19:14.210
there were accels and there was a lot of confiscation of property offer all

365
00:19:14.211 --> 00:19:17.780
Severus had grand ambitions of conquest, and those don't come cheap.

366
00:19:17.870 --> 00:19:21.530
His first military campaign took place in 197, 80 against puffier,

367
00:19:21.740 --> 00:19:23.480
like many Roman emperors before him.

368
00:19:23.540 --> 00:19:26.600
He was moderately successful and it's captured some territory. But in the end,

369
00:19:26.601 --> 00:19:30.350
despite two long seizures, he failed to conquer the fortified city of hotrod,

370
00:19:30.380 --> 00:19:33.520
just like Trajan had failed almost a century prior.

371
00:19:33.650 --> 00:19:37.730
His other main military campaign was in Britain in 280 D where he intended to

372
00:19:37.731 --> 00:19:40.610
conquer Caledonia, which roughly corresponds to Scotland.

373
00:19:40.611 --> 00:19:42.920
Nowadays his initial foray was successful,

374
00:19:42.950 --> 00:19:44.690
even though it came with heavy casualties.

375
00:19:44.691 --> 00:19:48.470
As the Caledonian is refused to engage in open combat and kept utilizing

376
00:19:48.471 --> 00:19:52.730
guerrilla warfare by 210 80, the enemy had been defeated and left no choice,

377
00:19:52.731 --> 00:19:53.690
but to Sue for peace,

378
00:19:53.720 --> 00:19:56.810
but the terms were so one-sided that they rebel just a few months later,

379
00:19:56.960 --> 00:19:58.940
it's Everest prepared for a second concussion.

380
00:19:59.000 --> 00:20:01.700
This one with the intent of wiping out the Caledonian is completely,

381
00:20:01.970 --> 00:20:06.890
his orders were less. No one escaped sheer destruction, no one, our hands,

382
00:20:06.950 --> 00:20:10.370
not even the babe in the womb of the mother, if it'd be male,

383
00:20:10.670 --> 00:20:12.800
let it nevertheless, not escape sheer destruction.

384
00:20:12.950 --> 00:20:14.810
He did not live to see his orders. Camry out though.

385
00:20:14.840 --> 00:20:18.020
Severus was already sick and stricken with gout and arthritis.

386
00:20:18.050 --> 00:20:20.180
He fell ill during the campaign and feeling it was the end.

387
00:20:20.181 --> 00:20:24.860
He retreated Borica more York as we call it today and died on the 4th of

388
00:20:24.860 --> 00:20:25.611
February 211,

389
00:20:25.611 --> 00:20:30.020
eight deep before his demise Severus had made his youngest son get her co member

390
00:20:30.080 --> 00:20:32.990
as well with hopes that he would reign alongside his older brother.

391
00:20:33.110 --> 00:20:34.640
This would not come to pass. However,

392
00:20:34.641 --> 00:20:38.060
as his eldest would go on to become one of the cruelest tyrants,

393
00:20:38.170 --> 00:20:39.920
do you ever sit on the Roman throne,

394
00:20:40.160 --> 00:20:45.110
but we will explore that story another day and we take a look at the rain of

395
00:20:45.470 --> 00:20:48.230
