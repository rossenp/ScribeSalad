00:00:00.090 --> 00:00:01.110
<v 0>Just before we get started,</v>

2
00:00:01.111 --> 00:00:03.960
I do want to mentioned another channel that I host called mega projects,

3
00:00:03.990 --> 00:00:06.570
mega projects. This is a channel all about mega projects,

4
00:00:07.170 --> 00:00:10.020
or I take a deep look at incredible buildings, project structures,

5
00:00:10.050 --> 00:00:13.650
and more whether it's the world's most impressive skyscrapers,

6
00:00:13.651 --> 00:00:15.150
the international space station,

7
00:00:15.270 --> 00:00:19.410
or to enable sarcophagus a covered or new videos come out a couple of times a

8
00:00:19.411 --> 00:00:22.260
week on mega projects. So if you think it could be for you,

9
00:00:22.261 --> 00:00:25.320
please do head on over and subscribe.

10
00:00:25.830 --> 00:00:28.410
There is a link below and let's get into it.

11
00:00:34.550 --> 00:00:38.510
The whole fabric of America is bloody to its very core and there's no quicker

12
00:00:38.750 --> 00:00:43.040
way to find out someone shares your blood loss than when the subject of serial

13
00:00:43.041 --> 00:00:47.240
killers comes up. Think about the recent Rene Psalms of true crime shows.

14
00:00:47.360 --> 00:00:49.880
Look at what some of the top rated podcasts are.

15
00:00:49.910 --> 00:00:54.710
People can't get enough murder in their recreational unwinding time.

16
00:00:54.800 --> 00:00:59.270
It's a way of living vicariously and maybe it's healthy overall,

17
00:00:59.690 --> 00:01:03.650
but it's more than a little dark serial killers and their tales of adventure.

18
00:01:03.651 --> 00:01:08.480
That captivated the public really seemed to hit a stride in the 1960s and

19
00:01:08.481 --> 00:01:09.140
thereafter,

20
00:01:09.140 --> 00:01:13.880
the Zodiac killer son of Sam ed Dean and John Wayne Gacy kept people glued to

21
00:01:14.060 --> 00:01:18.920
their newspapers and news broadcasts to see what awful mesmerizing things

22
00:01:18.921 --> 00:01:22.250
they had done. The cities and towns where these killers operated,

23
00:01:22.251 --> 00:01:27.140
stayed gripped in fear during the unpredictable than sporadic reigns of terror.

24
00:01:27.410 --> 00:01:31.820
And so that was just as true in the upstate New York town of Rochester in the

25
00:01:31.821 --> 00:01:36.260
early 1970s there between 1971 and 1973,

26
00:01:36.261 --> 00:01:38.630
someone was kidnapping children and murdering them.

27
00:01:38.990 --> 00:01:43.520
But that's just the beginning of the weirdness surrounding these cases here

28
00:01:43.730 --> 00:01:46.700
today, we take a look at the alphabet murders.

29
00:01:50.180 --> 00:01:51.200
<v 1>Mouse ran up.</v>

30
00:01:52.940 --> 00:01:56.030
<v 0>In the middle of afternoon of November, the 16th, 1971.</v>

31
00:01:56.031 --> 00:02:00.260
Ten-year-old Carmen colon was running errands before returning back to our home

32
00:02:00.261 --> 00:02:01.094
in Rochester,

33
00:02:01.130 --> 00:02:04.490
she made a stop at a pharmacy to pick up a prescription for our grandmother.

34
00:02:04.670 --> 00:02:08.030
And while being informed that the medication was not yet ready to be picked up,

35
00:02:08.190 --> 00:02:10.940
became noticeably distracted and upset.

36
00:02:10.970 --> 00:02:14.780
She told the owner of the pharmacy that she had to go and she got into a car

37
00:02:14.781 --> 00:02:16.910
parked nearby three hours later.

38
00:02:16.970 --> 00:02:20.570
She was reported missing to the Rochester police department in those few hours

39
00:02:20.571 --> 00:02:23.960
between her leaving the pharmacy and to becoming an official missing person.

40
00:02:24.110 --> 00:02:28.550
She was observed to local interstate half naked and flailing her arms for help.

41
00:02:28.670 --> 00:02:32.810
A vehicle identified as a dark Ford Pinza was backing up forensically and trying

42
00:02:32.811 --> 00:02:36.950
to run her down and eventually an individual overpowered her and throw it back

43
00:02:36.951 --> 00:02:39.650
in the car. About 30 motorists on the highway,

44
00:02:39.651 --> 00:02:43.490
witnessed the acts though not one soul attempted to intervene in the apparent

45
00:02:43.491 --> 00:02:44.240
abduction.

46
00:02:44.240 --> 00:02:48.920
None of the drivers who saw what happens even thought to call it in until three

47
00:02:48.921 --> 00:02:52.940
days later. Unfortunately by that time it was too late on November.

48
00:02:52.941 --> 00:02:55.820
The 18th two teenagers came across the body of common Guerlain,

49
00:02:55.821 --> 00:02:59.030
nearly 12 miles from where she was seen struggling on the,

50
00:02:59.650 --> 00:03:02.530
some of our clothing was in fact found near that very highway.

51
00:03:02.770 --> 00:03:03.640
She had been raped.

52
00:03:03.940 --> 00:03:06.730
Her skull had been fractured and she had been strangled to death.

53
00:03:06.820 --> 00:03:10.690
Local newspapers soon offered up a meager award for whoever could offer

54
00:03:10.691 --> 00:03:14.140
information leading to an arrest and some billboards. What nature were erected,

55
00:03:14.141 --> 00:03:17.500
asking for clues the potential suspects that would crop up after the first

56
00:03:17.501 --> 00:03:20.800
murder only added more perplexing questions to the case

57
00:03:27.960 --> 00:03:31.230
Was common Colin's uncle. And after our parents split up,

58
00:03:31.260 --> 00:03:33.450
he became even closer to Carmen and her mother,

59
00:03:33.480 --> 00:03:35.430
when she would take a usual walks to the pharmacy,

60
00:03:35.431 --> 00:03:37.860
she was usually accompanied by her grandfather, Felix,

61
00:03:37.861 --> 00:03:39.120
but on the day of the disappearance,

62
00:03:39.121 --> 00:03:42.120
she somehow persuaded him to let her travel alone.

63
00:03:42.270 --> 00:03:46.170
This was the day that she got into a strange car. Later on the highway,

64
00:03:46.200 --> 00:03:49.050
she was fleeing from what was presumably the same car,

65
00:03:49.230 --> 00:03:52.830
a dark Ford Pinto hatchback just before common Conan went missing.

66
00:03:52.831 --> 00:03:56.520
Her uncle Miguel took possession of a car that eerily matched the car from the

67
00:03:56.521 --> 00:03:58.650
highway incidents. When the authorities learned of this,

68
00:03:58.651 --> 00:04:01.860
they went to Miguel's home to search the vehicle. During the investigation,

69
00:04:01.890 --> 00:04:05.010
they took note of the car. Having recently been profusely cleaned,

70
00:04:05.011 --> 00:04:05.970
especially the trunk,

71
00:04:06.150 --> 00:04:09.750
which had been gone over in detail with a rather strong cleaning products. Now,

72
00:04:09.751 --> 00:04:13.830
if you've paid attention to anyone's car trunk ever you'll know that this is a

73
00:04:13.831 --> 00:04:16.920
pretty rare occurrence. Investigators asked the dealership.

74
00:04:16.921 --> 00:04:18.180
If that was a common practice,

75
00:04:18.181 --> 00:04:20.850
since it was a relatively new purchase on Miguel's behalf,

76
00:04:21.060 --> 00:04:24.450
the dealer stated that they have not conducted such a cleaning, more creepily.

77
00:04:24.451 --> 00:04:26.670
A doll of Carmen was found in the car,

78
00:04:26.671 --> 00:04:30.720
which he explains off by saying he was a family member and that it wasn't very

79
00:04:30.721 --> 00:04:32.730
strange at all, but it was strange. However,

80
00:04:32.790 --> 00:04:35.640
it was Miguel's sudden panic two days after Common's death,

81
00:04:35.641 --> 00:04:38.910
in which she allegedly told a friends that he had to flee the country because he

82
00:04:38.911 --> 00:04:40.620
had done something wrong in Rochester.

83
00:04:40.680 --> 00:04:43.470
And indeed he did take off for Puerto Rico very soon after.

84
00:04:43.710 --> 00:04:46.800
And this isn't the last year here about Miguel colon in this video.

85
00:04:47.340 --> 00:04:48.173
<v 2>Hmm.</v>

86
00:04:53.460 --> 00:04:57.480
<v 0>Early April afternoon in 1972, more than a year after common Colin's murder,</v>

87
00:04:57.630 --> 00:05:01.020
11 year old Wando Alco it's was heading home after an errands,

88
00:05:01.021 --> 00:05:04.470
much like Carmen had been in a hometown of Rochester, just like Carmen.

89
00:05:04.620 --> 00:05:08.070
She was getting groceries and headed back down the road towards the house.

90
00:05:08.280 --> 00:05:12.390
It was 5:15 PM. Joyce Wanda's mother reported her missing it around 8:00 PM.

91
00:05:12.660 --> 00:05:16.170
A slew of detectives canvassed an enormous area of land near our home.

92
00:05:16.350 --> 00:05:18.600
They scarred the area around the grocery store.

93
00:05:18.630 --> 00:05:22.170
They knew she had been out before a disappearance and they searched near the

94
00:05:22.171 --> 00:05:25.470
local river where they knew she would sometimes play rescue teams out.

95
00:05:25.471 --> 00:05:29.640
A few straggling reports of wander grocery bags in hand resting against the

96
00:05:29.641 --> 00:05:31.860
fence to keep herself from dropping the bags.

97
00:05:32.040 --> 00:05:34.560
As a dark Brown Vic had approached at a 10:00 AM.

98
00:05:34.561 --> 00:05:37.260
The next morning a policeman found her body at the base of a Hill.

99
00:05:37.500 --> 00:05:41.220
It had been apparently thrown from a moving car and rolled down to the ground

100
00:05:41.221 --> 00:05:45.090
below. She had been sexually assaulted and choked to death, much like common.

101
00:05:45.091 --> 00:05:47.280
The previous yet she had fought her attacker,

102
00:05:47.281 --> 00:05:49.650
which was clear from the defensive wounds. Oddly,

103
00:05:49.710 --> 00:05:52.050
she had a noticeable amount of white hair on her body,

104
00:05:52.051 --> 00:05:55.350
even though no family owned such animals during the autopsy,

105
00:05:55.380 --> 00:05:57.860
custard was discovered around her contents,

106
00:05:57.920 --> 00:06:00.890
something a family swore she would not have eaten at home or school.

107
00:06:01.040 --> 00:06:02.150
So it was her killer feeding.

108
00:06:02.151 --> 00:06:06.350
Her hotlines were set up much larger rewards of $10,000 were offered.

109
00:06:06.351 --> 00:06:10.070
And tips rolled in from the public one tip came from someone who said they saw

110
00:06:10.071 --> 00:06:13.490
one to speaking with the driver of that Brown car from the passenger side window

111
00:06:13.491 --> 00:06:14.630
just before she went missing.

112
00:06:14.690 --> 00:06:17.750
Another tip said they saw a man forcing a girl matching wanders,

113
00:06:17.751 --> 00:06:20.780
looks into a light colored Dodge dot type automobile.

114
00:06:21.320 --> 00:06:24.080
Flyers were plastered all over the surrounding neighborhoods in the hopes that

115
00:06:24.260 --> 00:06:27.380
any shred of evidence would point investigators in the right direction.

116
00:06:27.620 --> 00:06:31.340
The already apparent surface similarities between common and wonders cases were

117
00:06:31.520 --> 00:06:35.210
almost immediately dismissed by the local police departments. More suspects,

118
00:06:35.240 --> 00:06:37.420
more tips, and even more questions.

119
00:06:44.350 --> 00:06:45.010
<v 2>Michelle.</v>

120
00:06:45.010 --> 00:06:48.610
<v 0>Was returning home from school on November the 26th, 1973,</v>

121
00:06:48.760 --> 00:06:51.880
just about seven months after the murder of Wando alphabets.

122
00:06:51.940 --> 00:06:55.180
The 11 year old stopped as a Rochester department store on the way back

123
00:06:55.181 --> 00:06:58.880
attempting to fetch a purse. A mother had left there earlier, her uncle pasta,

124
00:06:58.930 --> 00:07:02.350
some points offering to give her a ride, but Michelle opted to go it alone.

125
00:07:02.500 --> 00:07:06.700
Witnesses reported that soon after she was seen entering a tan or beige vehicle,

126
00:07:06.760 --> 00:07:08.560
this was not her uncle's car.

127
00:07:08.830 --> 00:07:11.710
Her mother reported her missing that evening around 4:30 PM.

128
00:07:11.770 --> 00:07:14.680
A girl who matched Menzes his features were seen eating at a fast food

129
00:07:14.681 --> 00:07:19.240
restaurant with a man described as a Caucasian between the ages of 25 and 35 and

130
00:07:19.270 --> 00:07:22.000
roughly six feet tall or 165 pounds,

131
00:07:22.060 --> 00:07:24.940
a person traveling down a nearby road around 5:30 PM.

132
00:07:24.941 --> 00:07:29.020
That days that they saw the same beige or tan colored vehicle as earlier in the

133
00:07:29.021 --> 00:07:30.580
afternoon. But with a flat tire,

134
00:07:30.610 --> 00:07:34.420
the motorist also apparently saw a girl that looked very much like Michelle and

135
00:07:34.840 --> 00:07:36.430
noticed she was in a fair amount of distress.

136
00:07:36.580 --> 00:07:40.150
She was being held by the wrist by the driver outside of the car.

137
00:07:40.151 --> 00:07:43.030
And when the approaching witness tried to stop and check on the girl,

138
00:07:43.210 --> 00:07:45.010
he was matched with a glare by the suspect.

139
00:07:45.130 --> 00:07:48.070
The kidnapper tried to hide the girl behind him and also attempted to keep his

140
00:07:48.071 --> 00:07:49.450
license plate out of sight.

141
00:07:49.600 --> 00:07:53.020
He puts off a menacing enough vibe that the would be helper drove off.

142
00:07:53.140 --> 00:07:55.930
Two days later on November, the 28th, Michelle mans,

143
00:07:55.931 --> 00:07:58.930
his body was found in a ditch roughly 50 miles from our home,

144
00:07:58.990 --> 00:08:01.870
just like the first two victims she had been sexually assaulted and then

145
00:08:01.871 --> 00:08:05.710
strangled with some kind of rope or cord. And just like one, two alphabets.

146
00:08:05.890 --> 00:08:08.350
She had numerous strands of white cat hair on her.

147
00:08:08.410 --> 00:08:11.770
Some small samples of prints and seamen were able to be recovered.

148
00:08:11.771 --> 00:08:12.720
And upon autopsy,

149
00:08:12.850 --> 00:08:16.510
her stomach contents included traces of hamburger backing up the story of her

150
00:08:16.780 --> 00:08:18.520
lost being seen at a fast food restaurant,

151
00:08:18.580 --> 00:08:21.760
a composite sketch of the man who was seen with her was circulated,

152
00:08:21.761 --> 00:08:25.630
but like most of the tiny nuggets of possible leads that crept up through the

153
00:08:25.631 --> 00:08:28.420
case, real concrete information was not to be had.

154
00:08:34.060 --> 00:08:34.630
<v 2>[Inaudible].</v>

155
00:08:34.630 --> 00:08:37.330
<v 0>So why were these dubbed the alphabet murders? Well,</v>

156
00:08:37.360 --> 00:08:41.230
you may have noticed that all three victims first and last names that started

157
00:08:41.231 --> 00:08:43.780
with the same letter as time has gone on experts.

158
00:08:43.781 --> 00:08:46.810
Think the likelihood that this was intentional is very low,

159
00:08:46.811 --> 00:08:49.660
but even if the killer had chosen his victims on this basis,

160
00:08:49.870 --> 00:08:53.650
that's not even the strangest of the similarities in the crimes.

161
00:08:53.710 --> 00:08:55.890
There's the final resting place of each body.

162
00:08:55.950 --> 00:08:59.460
All three children were from Rochester, but when their bodies were discovered,

163
00:08:59.461 --> 00:09:02.940
it was in a different town and each town corresponded to their names.

164
00:09:03.480 --> 00:09:06.510
Carmen Caroline's body was found in the town of Churchville Orlando.

165
00:09:07.080 --> 00:09:10.020
Accurate's we're seven miles away from Rochester in the town of Webster.

166
00:09:10.140 --> 00:09:12.150
And Michelle Monza was found in Mason.

167
00:09:12.420 --> 00:09:14.430
While you could argue that the names were coincidences,

168
00:09:14.431 --> 00:09:18.060
it's hard to argue that the killer didn't somehow plan to dump each victim in a

169
00:09:18.061 --> 00:09:20.310
place that matched their name lettering.

170
00:09:20.370 --> 00:09:23.640
There's also the obvious facts that each of the victims was a pre-teen girl.

171
00:09:23.760 --> 00:09:25.710
They all disappeared during rainy days.

172
00:09:25.920 --> 00:09:28.350
We're a short height and we're all seen as loner types,

173
00:09:28.351 --> 00:09:31.590
without many close friends. The positioning of each body when they were found,

174
00:09:31.710 --> 00:09:33.990
seemed to point to them all being stoned from a vehicle.

175
00:09:34.140 --> 00:09:38.220
Each girl was brought up in a poor Catholic family and had a history with being

176
00:09:38.221 --> 00:09:41.160
bullied and having issues with academic performance in school,

177
00:09:41.161 --> 00:09:44.700
which gave investigators some inkling that the murderer may have had a

178
00:09:44.701 --> 00:09:49.500
background in social services and thus had access to knowing these very specific

179
00:09:49.501 --> 00:09:50.610
details about the girls.

180
00:09:56.930 --> 00:09:57.380
<v 2>[Inaudible].</v>

181
00:09:57.380 --> 00:10:01.490
<v 0>As long as we mentioned spirited away to Puerto Rico for short days after his</v>

182
00:10:01.491 --> 00:10:03.800
niece was killed in March of 1972,

183
00:10:03.801 --> 00:10:07.580
investigators made their way down there to begin asking him questions about her

184
00:10:07.581 --> 00:10:08.810
disappearance and murder,

185
00:10:09.040 --> 00:10:12.380
or the fact that he had a car that resembled the one scene during the time of

186
00:10:12.770 --> 00:10:15.620
commons kidnapping and the suspicious extent to which the vehicle had been

187
00:10:16.250 --> 00:10:19.490
cleaned, gave them plenty of suspicion. However, down in Puerto Rico,

188
00:10:19.520 --> 00:10:23.450
newspapers caught wind of the authorities desire to interview him and published

189
00:10:23.451 --> 00:10:25.940
articles that Miguel saw causing him to fleet.

190
00:10:26.000 --> 00:10:29.900
He did return later in March and was extradited back to New York state during

191
00:10:29.901 --> 00:10:33.590
questioning Miguel was not able to provide a sufficient excuse for where he was

192
00:10:33.591 --> 00:10:37.820
during commons disappearance and has no other people who could back him up

193
00:10:37.821 --> 00:10:41.000
regarding his location that day, despite strong suspicion,

194
00:10:41.180 --> 00:10:42.890
but they have their guy in the end.

195
00:10:42.920 --> 00:10:46.580
There was no physical evidence that could definitively link him or his car to

196
00:10:46.581 --> 00:10:49.970
the crimes. In 1991, 20 years after his niece was killed.

197
00:10:50.120 --> 00:10:53.960
Miguel took his own life after being involved in a dispute at home where he shot

198
00:10:53.961 --> 00:10:55.550
his brother and his wife,

199
00:10:55.760 --> 00:10:58.940
the good Samaritan who tried to approach the individual who had captured

200
00:10:59.330 --> 00:11:00.770
Michelle mains, uh, was a bit of help.

201
00:11:00.980 --> 00:11:04.220
Even though the kidnapper tried to block him from seeing his license plate,

202
00:11:04.340 --> 00:11:07.640
that person was able to read off a partial plate to the authorities,

203
00:11:07.730 --> 00:11:08.630
as luck would have it.

204
00:11:08.631 --> 00:11:11.930
He ran across the same car several days later and was able to provide the full

205
00:11:11.931 --> 00:11:13.010
license plate number.

206
00:11:13.040 --> 00:11:16.310
This led police to a man living with this family and lawns, New York,

207
00:11:16.330 --> 00:11:19.700
just over 40 miles from Rochester. This new suspect had a beige colored.

208
00:11:19.820 --> 00:11:23.570
So down a strong resemblance to witness sketches and had been in trouble with

209
00:11:23.571 --> 00:11:26.900
the law for petty crimes required to while it's alimony to the police was that

210
00:11:26.901 --> 00:11:30.680
he had been out looking for work that entire date upon further investigation and

211
00:11:30.920 --> 00:11:34.190
perusing phone records. It seems that his alibi was at site,

212
00:11:34.460 --> 00:11:37.880
even passed a polygraph. The suspect never had his name released.

213
00:11:37.881 --> 00:11:41.780
And even though he might've been the closest to police got to a real lead and

214
00:11:41.781 --> 00:11:45.830
other lbs out Dennis demine was another potential lead in the alphabet murders,

215
00:11:45.980 --> 00:11:48.650
a local firefighter in the Rochester area, too many.

216
00:11:48.651 --> 00:11:53.530
It was also known as the garage rapist and had raped at least 14 females between

217
00:11:53.531 --> 00:11:57.970
the years of 1971 and 1973, which are the years that the alphabet mergers,

218
00:11:58.450 --> 00:12:00.550
Curt so many owns a beige colored car,

219
00:12:00.580 --> 00:12:03.250
which was the color of vehicle that had been seen at more than one of the

220
00:12:03.251 --> 00:12:04.030
abductions.

221
00:12:04.030 --> 00:12:07.570
He also resided on the street very close to the area where witnesses last

222
00:12:07.571 --> 00:12:08.051
reported.

223
00:12:08.051 --> 00:12:12.190
Seeing Michelle Menza Menza was thought to be the last victim of the alphabet

224
00:12:12.191 --> 00:12:14.200
murders. But five weeks after a death,

225
00:12:14.230 --> 00:12:17.620
Dennis Domini tried to pull a gun on a teenage girl with the intent of

226
00:12:17.621 --> 00:12:21.190
abducting, her. She started screaming, which led him to flee the scene,

227
00:12:21.220 --> 00:12:24.280
but he obviously didn't learn his lesson and try it again. Soon off to get up.

228
00:12:24.281 --> 00:12:28.450
Another girl police were made aware and started off to him to many was not going

229
00:12:28.451 --> 00:12:32.170
to be captured alive. And so he shot himself in the head years later,

230
00:12:32.171 --> 00:12:34.990
forensic studies were conducted with 10 minis, zoomed corpse.

231
00:12:35.140 --> 00:12:39.030
They compared to DNA from his body to semen samples that were saved from Wando.

232
00:12:39.670 --> 00:12:41.350
Acquits nothing matched. Unfortunately,

233
00:12:41.351 --> 00:12:43.870
no evidence was available from Michel means his body,

234
00:12:43.871 --> 00:12:48.160
the one victim they had most closely tied to his car. However,

235
00:12:48.200 --> 00:12:52.330
had all sorts of white cat air on the surfaces within and as we know why scatter

236
00:12:52.331 --> 00:12:54.370
was found on two of the alphabet victims,

237
00:12:54.430 --> 00:12:58.270
then this Kenneth Yankee who drew police interest because he lived in works near

238
00:12:58.271 --> 00:13:01.450
the first two murder locations. He held jobs as an ice cream man,

239
00:13:01.451 --> 00:13:03.430
a security guard and an ambulance driver,

240
00:13:03.431 --> 00:13:06.910
which made investigators think he wore many uniforms that would make children

241
00:13:06.911 --> 00:13:08.170
approach him and trust him.

242
00:13:08.410 --> 00:13:12.220
He too had a car that matched the description passed around as being near the

243
00:13:12.221 --> 00:13:16.150
scenes of the alphabet abductions. Bianca moved to California in 1976,

244
00:13:16.151 --> 00:13:17.530
three years after the last killing,

245
00:13:17.560 --> 00:13:20.230
he and his cousin became serial killers on the West coast,

246
00:13:20.231 --> 00:13:23.860
known as the hillside strangler between 1977 and 1978.

247
00:13:23.890 --> 00:13:27.820
They murdered 10 females between the ages of 12 and 28 though.

248
00:13:27.970 --> 00:13:31.600
Bianca strongly denies having anything to do with the alphabet murders. Yes.

249
00:13:31.610 --> 00:13:35.320
Another subject was Joseph NASA who did his own series of killings in

250
00:13:35.321 --> 00:13:38.170
California, between 1977 and 1994.

251
00:13:38.200 --> 00:13:40.480
His victims were mostly believed to be prostitutes.

252
00:13:40.510 --> 00:13:45.040
But one interesting detail that came up was that all the females he killed first

253
00:13:45.041 --> 00:13:48.400
and last names that began with the same letter, just like the alphabet murders.

254
00:13:48.640 --> 00:13:53.230
NASA was also a Rochester, New York native and lived there in the early 1970s.

255
00:13:53.320 --> 00:13:57.070
In fact, he often traveled back and forth between New York and California,

256
00:13:57.130 --> 00:13:59.110
and this wasn't lost on investigators.

257
00:13:59.200 --> 00:14:02.710
The same samples they tested from wonder Wacker what's his body against Dennis

258
00:14:02.830 --> 00:14:07.180
to many were tested against naysayers DNA and they did not match NASA was

259
00:14:07.181 --> 00:14:09.850
convicted of his own California alphabet murders, however,

260
00:14:09.851 --> 00:14:12.130
and was sentenced to death in 2013,

261
00:14:12.400 --> 00:14:14.530
when police searched his house more thoroughly,

262
00:14:14.560 --> 00:14:17.110
they found an absolutely insane journal.

263
00:14:17.170 --> 00:14:19.360
The way NASA kept the details of his murder.

264
00:14:26.130 --> 00:14:29.010
Obviously the alphabet murders remain unsolved to this day.

265
00:14:29.070 --> 00:14:32.190
This all pieces of evidence have pointed to many potential suspects,

266
00:14:32.191 --> 00:14:35.490
but none of it has been indisputable enough to land a conviction.

267
00:14:35.580 --> 00:14:39.000
It's not even truly known. If all three murders are definitely connected.

268
00:14:39.060 --> 00:14:42.810
Tips rolled in from the public and new suspects had a brief light shined on

269
00:14:42.811 --> 00:14:44.850
them, but then something wouldn't connect,

270
00:14:44.910 --> 00:14:48.060
a polygraph would parcel and alibi would line up.

271
00:14:48.240 --> 00:14:52.580
Did Joseph Nissa merely move to California and continue killing their retaining

272
00:14:52.610 --> 00:14:55.400
the alphabet method? Was it someone else entirely?

273
00:14:55.401 --> 00:14:58.010
And they just moved somewhere else and killed that.

274
00:14:58.070 --> 00:15:01.700
Did they feel like the law was closing in after the third merger and they

275
00:15:01.701 --> 00:15:03.380
somehow quelled the urge to kill again?

276
00:15:03.710 --> 00:15:07.850
There aren't so many questions and zero sense of closure for the families.

277
00:15:07.970 --> 00:15:10.970
Even the experts have a hard time drawing conclusions.

278
00:15:11.150 --> 00:15:14.810
One such expert was Robert wrestler who actually came up with the term serial

279
00:15:14.811 --> 00:15:18.920
killer and do spent decades profiling them and trying to get inside their heads.

280
00:15:19.220 --> 00:15:23.060
Wrestler worked at the FBI and the behavioral sciences units where he got to

281
00:15:23.061 --> 00:15:26.570
examine the actions and thoughts of some of the most horrid people that ever

282
00:15:26.571 --> 00:15:27.404
lived.

283
00:15:27.470 --> 00:15:30.230
Wrestler actually did not believe that the same person conducted all three

284
00:15:30.231 --> 00:15:32.510
killings. When you draw profiles of the killers,

285
00:15:32.540 --> 00:15:36.140
he believed that commons killing shows a much higher level of anger and

286
00:15:36.141 --> 00:15:36.710
aggression.

287
00:15:36.710 --> 00:15:40.490
She also had not received food before a death like the other two girls seemingly

288
00:15:40.491 --> 00:15:43.100
did finally the killer choked out with his hands,

289
00:15:43.101 --> 00:15:45.560
whereas wander and Michelle had ligatures used on them.

290
00:15:45.890 --> 00:15:49.550
The experts also seem to believe that the matching first and last initials of

291
00:15:49.551 --> 00:15:51.320
each victim was purely coincidence.

292
00:15:51.350 --> 00:15:54.170
They believed that the level of thought required organizational skill,

293
00:15:54.171 --> 00:15:56.630
that the killer simply did not have the murders,

294
00:15:56.660 --> 00:15:58.160
the brutal dumping of the bodies,

295
00:15:58.161 --> 00:16:01.670
and even the kidnappings themselves at no methodical orchestration to them.

296
00:16:01.730 --> 00:16:04.070
Is it possible that the killers trial run with common,

297
00:16:04.071 --> 00:16:07.550
didn't go according to plan and that he got better at his work with the next

298
00:16:07.820 --> 00:16:10.460
two. Of course, we just can't say

299
00:16:16.630 --> 00:16:20.530
The New York state police city of Rochester police and two neighboring County

300
00:16:20.531 --> 00:16:24.190
departments all still have open cases for the girls who were killed the

301
00:16:24.191 --> 00:16:27.580
departments still work closely together and meet to discuss new details.

302
00:16:27.581 --> 00:16:30.430
When they come up new technology being much more advanced than what was

303
00:16:30.431 --> 00:16:31.870
available in the 1970s,

304
00:16:31.930 --> 00:16:36.310
they are now able to test genetics and swab for DNA to create new suspects or

305
00:16:36.340 --> 00:16:37.420
eliminate past ones.

306
00:16:37.540 --> 00:16:41.290
Databases are available to instantly access information from decades ago,

307
00:16:41.350 --> 00:16:44.710
the original detectives meet with the new guard to pick each other's brains and

308
00:16:44.711 --> 00:16:45.544
share leads.

309
00:16:45.670 --> 00:16:49.150
They all share the same sense of wanting to honor the memories of the girls and

310
00:16:49.390 --> 00:16:53.950
help the families close a door. That's been maddeningly left open for so long.

311
00:16:54.010 --> 00:16:55.810
Carmen colon one, two acrobats,

312
00:16:55.930 --> 00:17:00.340
and Michelle May now all share the same cemetery in Rochester was that final

313
00:17:00.341 --> 00:17:03.280
resting place. So I'm not going to ask whether you enjoyed that video,

314
00:17:03.281 --> 00:17:05.650
