improve your stem skills while having a great time learning a brilliant

4
00:00:10.420 --> 00:00:13.520
org slash biographics more on them in a bit.

5
00:00:19.660 --> 00:00:23.550
Who do you of when you hear the words, father of the atomic bomb,

6
00:00:23.680 --> 00:00:25.670
we're guessing it's Robert Oppenheimer,

7
00:00:25.730 --> 00:00:30.030
the leader of the man Hatan project who famously responded to the first ABOM

8
00:00:30.031 --> 00:00:34.750
test by declaring. Now I am become death destroyer of worlds,

9
00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:37.350
but what if we told you there was another contender,

10
00:00:37.550 --> 00:00:42.420
a scientist who came this close to making the big break in 1934,

11
00:00:42.860 --> 00:00:45.260
a breakthrough that could have resulted in Nazi Germany,

12
00:00:45.310 --> 00:00:47.620
developing the world's first nuclear weapon.

13
00:00:47.880 --> 00:00:52.620
The scientist who almost created this terrifying alternative reality was on

14
00:00:52.690 --> 00:00:56.020
Rico. Firmi the godfather of the atom bomb,

15
00:00:56.580 --> 00:00:59.620
a leading light in both experimental and theoretical physics.

16
00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:02.970
Firmi was an almost one in a generation genius.

17
00:01:03.310 --> 00:01:07.410
It was Firmi who built the first operational nuclear reactor in 1942.

18
00:01:08.170 --> 00:01:12.330
Firmi who created our understanding of the subtopic particles known today as

19
00:01:12.610 --> 00:01:17.570
firm ons and Firmi who helped Oppenheimer father the bomb from fascist ly to

20
00:01:17.571 --> 00:01:20.690
world Wari America. This is the life of ENCO.

21
00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:24.920
Firmi the greatest Italian scientist. The side of Galileo.

22
00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:33.600
One of the themes we've touched on time. And again,

23
00:01:33.860 --> 00:01:36.440
is that despite what fiction tells you,

24
00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:40.560
you usually can't tell which child is gonna grow up to change the world.

25
00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:44.270
Oon Bismark. For example, was a lazy as a kid mathematician,

26
00:01:44.590 --> 00:01:46.790
any Noha was going to be a language teacher.

27
00:01:47.350 --> 00:01:50.270
Johan Kepler was obsessed with joining the priesthood,

28
00:01:50.570 --> 00:01:55.510
but there are times when even real life follows the rules of fiction times

29
00:01:55.620 --> 00:01:59.710
when you can really just look at a child and think that kid's gonna be world

30
00:02:00.030 --> 00:02:01.950
famous someday ENCO Furney.

31
00:02:02.510 --> 00:02:05.380
He was one of those kids born in Rome on September the 29th,

32
00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:07.580
1901 Firmey came from an average family.

33
00:02:07.960 --> 00:02:11.900
His father was a government railway inspector while his mother Ida was a

34
00:02:11.901 --> 00:02:15.020
teacher, but Ida was above average in one very particular way.

35
00:02:15.240 --> 00:02:18.940
She believed acquiring knowledge was an almost sacred duty.

36
00:02:19.240 --> 00:02:22.940
You might say that this was the closest thing to religion in the Firmi household

37
00:02:24.010 --> 00:02:25.530
for the time the family weren't Catholic.

38
00:02:25.710 --> 00:02:29.210
And they sent young Firmi to one of the few secular schools in Rome,

39
00:02:29.930 --> 00:02:34.050
their age Donie six family began to show signs of the genius that he would

40
00:02:34.051 --> 00:02:34.480
become.

41
00:02:34.480 --> 00:02:38.730
Basically from the moment he started school Firmi was consistently at the top of

42
00:02:38.731 --> 00:02:42.770
his class. I had instilled in him a deep love for math, science,

43
00:02:42.910 --> 00:02:46.840
and engineering and everything else, brainy. We're not studying. The boys,

44
00:02:46.841 --> 00:02:50.640
spent his time building electric motors with his older brother Guo. So yes,

45
00:02:50.641 --> 00:02:53.560
if you'd been introduced to child from circuit 1910,

46
00:02:53.561 --> 00:02:56.240
you'd have probably thought to yourself, Hm, it's gonna be big,

47
00:02:56.620 --> 00:02:58.200
but you might not have guessed.

48
00:02:58.390 --> 00:03:02.680
He'd be big in the world of physics that's because it had take a tragedy to set

49
00:03:02.920 --> 00:03:06.080
firm me on that particular path. In January,

50
00:03:06.080 --> 00:03:09.920
1915 firm's brother went into hospital for routine surgery on a throat.

51
00:03:10.440 --> 00:03:13.320
Absess something went wrong and he died on the operating table,

52
00:03:13.680 --> 00:03:17.360
bleeding out at age, Jonie 15 for the teenage Firmey. This was like,

53
00:03:17.460 --> 00:03:22.070
God had held a lightning bolt right into the middle of his life.

54
00:03:22.410 --> 00:03:25.110
As a boy firm had always been shy and introverted,

55
00:03:25.250 --> 00:03:26.950
but in the wake of Gil's death,

56
00:03:27.050 --> 00:03:31.910
he became almost catatonically withdrawn frightened either tried to convince her

57
00:03:31.911 --> 00:03:33.390
son to lose himself in his studies.

58
00:03:33.690 --> 00:03:37.430
She found a 50 year old book on physics and gave it to the boy to read what

59
00:03:37.830 --> 00:03:39.660
Firmi read there blew his young minds.

60
00:03:39.710 --> 00:03:43.740
There was something about the world described in that book that just made sense

61
00:03:43.760 --> 00:03:48.260
to firm me that made him want to learn more. From that point on the boy,

62
00:03:48.261 --> 00:03:51.660
wouldn't be a magpie leaping from one stem subject to the next,

63
00:03:52.120 --> 00:03:56.900
his mind would instead be a high powered laser focused solely on physics

64
00:03:57.280 --> 00:03:58.580
in 19 18,

65
00:03:58.580 --> 00:04:03.370
3 years after Guo firm applied to the prestigious schooler Noal superior in

66
00:04:03.770 --> 00:04:06.770
Piza on November the 14th that year he sat the entrance exam.

67
00:04:06.910 --> 00:04:10.490
The task was to write a competitive essay. Firmi chose the topic.

68
00:04:10.630 --> 00:04:13.370
Characteristics of sounds. When the examiner read it,

69
00:04:13.710 --> 00:04:14.850
he nearly fell off his chair.

70
00:04:14.980 --> 00:04:17.610
While anyone sitting this exam was naturally intelligent.

71
00:04:18.290 --> 00:04:19.410
Firmi was at a whole different level.

72
00:04:19.890 --> 00:04:22.680
It turns in a paper that would've been impressive for.

73
00:04:22.720 --> 00:04:26.840
A doctoral thesis Firmey was instantly fast tracked onto the school's doctoral

74
00:04:26.841 --> 00:04:30.160
program with his advisor, the director of the physics laboratory.

75
00:04:30.220 --> 00:04:33.000
But the director soon realized this kid was such a natural,

76
00:04:33.070 --> 00:04:37.080
that it was impossible to teach him stuff in just three years of self-study

77
00:04:37.480 --> 00:04:41.150
Firmey had become so good at physics that he could run rings around a department

78
00:04:41.510 --> 00:04:44.390
chair. Everybody at the school could agree on one thing.

79
00:04:44.660 --> 00:04:47.190
They couldn't wait to see what he did next.

80
00:04:53.610 --> 00:04:56.230
At the same time firm was rising through the physics profession,

81
00:04:56.231 --> 00:04:57.750
like an out of control weather balloon.

82
00:04:57.900 --> 00:05:02.820
Another Italian also found himself being CATA towards stardom on March

83
00:05:02.840 --> 00:05:03.940
the 23rd, 19,

84
00:05:04.220 --> 00:05:08.900
19 MI months after Firmi SATs exam Benito mu founded the fascist party.

85
00:05:09.420 --> 00:05:13.140
Although neither Firmi nor mu could have known as at the time their lives were

86
00:05:13.141 --> 00:05:15.980
destined to cross in a way that would change history.

87
00:05:15.981 --> 00:05:20.100
Within a year of the fascist party's appearance chapters had sprung up across

88
00:05:20.120 --> 00:05:22.890
the nation and whole gins descended into violence.

89
00:05:23.570 --> 00:05:27.890
Mu was a world class Rabel rouser or a guy who could whip up a mob in the time

90
00:05:28.050 --> 00:05:30.450
of digs to boil an egg. As his influence spreads,

91
00:05:30.451 --> 00:05:32.650
black sharp militias began attacking leftists,

92
00:05:32.651 --> 00:05:36.570
burning down trade union officers and physically stopping left wing officials

93
00:05:36.640 --> 00:05:39.410
from taking their posts come July, 1922,

94
00:05:39.630 --> 00:05:44.160
the whole of Italy knew MU's name and either loved him or

95
00:05:44.161 --> 00:05:47.080
loathed him with one possible exception.

96
00:05:47.340 --> 00:05:50.880
All his life en Rico Firmi would be staunchly apolitical,

97
00:05:50.881 --> 00:05:53.880
never showing the slightest hints of an interest in politics.

98
00:05:54.140 --> 00:05:55.880
As Italy fell into chaos that summer,

99
00:05:56.060 --> 00:06:01.000
he was likely thinking of only one thing defending his thesis right now.

100
00:06:01.001 --> 00:06:05.400
Firm had already published his first couple of papers and his planet size brain

101
00:06:05.580 --> 00:06:09.960
was infamous across P when he actually came to defend his thesis before 11

102
00:06:10.240 --> 00:06:10.660
examiners,

103
00:06:10.660 --> 00:06:14.600
it said only two of them were capable of crossing what he was talking about.

104
00:06:15.240 --> 00:06:19.190
Firmi graduated with honors almost immediately receiving a governmental grant to

105
00:06:19.191 --> 00:06:20.024
continuous studies.

106
00:06:20.450 --> 00:06:23.470
Not that the governments would be around for much longer though.

107
00:06:23.990 --> 00:06:28.270
That same summer mu black shirts smashed a general strike calls by Italian

108
00:06:28.310 --> 00:06:30.270
leftists on October the 24th,

109
00:06:30.410 --> 00:06:34.830
before a gathering of 40,000 fascists still Duche declared that the government

110
00:06:34.850 --> 00:06:39.580
was incapable of governing and his party would physically remove it from power

111
00:06:40.410 --> 00:06:43.780
MU's March on Rome was the moment democracy died in Italy,

112
00:06:43.870 --> 00:06:45.060
faced with an insurrection.

113
00:06:45.360 --> 00:06:49.580
The government collapsed preferring fascism to anarchy king Victor Manuel II

114
00:06:49.730 --> 00:06:53.740
invited mu to form a new government on Halloween that year a fitting date.

115
00:06:53.800 --> 00:06:58.770
If the revel was one Italy's boulderer fatter version of became prime

116
00:06:58.970 --> 00:07:01.330
minister, the first fascist leader in history,

117
00:07:01.470 --> 00:07:04.490
but while life was about to take a bad turn for Italy in general,

118
00:07:04.870 --> 00:07:08.890
it was taking a series of extremely good turns for en Rico.

119
00:07:09.370 --> 00:07:11.770
Firmi between 1922 and 1926.

120
00:07:12.170 --> 00:07:15.330
Firmi won a series of scholarships going abroad to teach in Germany and the

121
00:07:15.331 --> 00:07:18.800
Netherlands. By the time he settles back in Italy in 90, in 26,

122
00:07:18.820 --> 00:07:20.240
he was ready to change. The world,

123
00:07:20.470 --> 00:07:24.920
offered the chair of theoretical physics at the university of Rome age, just 25.

124
00:07:25.290 --> 00:07:27.480
Firmi made breakthrough after breakthrough,

125
00:07:27.481 --> 00:07:31.840
perhaps his most lasting was the developments of what are known as Firmi direct

126
00:07:31.850 --> 00:07:32.521
statistics.

127
00:07:32.521 --> 00:07:35.840
Basically a way of understanding a group of subatomic particles that would

128
00:07:35.841 --> 00:07:39.830
otherwise make us go what every time we're he thought about them. In fact,

129
00:07:40.350 --> 00:07:44.670
Firmi was so prolific and its intuition so often accurate that his colleagues

130
00:07:44.671 --> 00:07:46.790
started calling him the Pope of physics,

131
00:07:47.090 --> 00:07:50.190
but it wasn't just firm's colleagues who were paying attention to his

132
00:07:50.191 --> 00:07:52.470
extraordinary mind in 1929,

133
00:07:52.950 --> 00:07:57.110
Benito mu now absolute dictator of Italy personally appointed Firmi to the

134
00:07:57.310 --> 00:08:02.100
academia delin. The a physicist was given a huge salary, a uniform to wear,

135
00:08:02.360 --> 00:08:03.980
and the title of excellence,

136
00:08:04.440 --> 00:08:09.140
all he had to do in return was bring glory upon mu Italy by making more

137
00:08:09.141 --> 00:08:11.540
breakthroughs, SC. Well,

138
00:08:11.541 --> 00:08:15.900
that's what happened next in his new post Firmi would soon come terrifyingly

139
00:08:15.901 --> 00:08:19.060
close to giving I Duche the key to the atom bomb.

140
00:08:25.670 --> 00:08:29.050
The next few years were crazy busy for FA in 1928.

141
00:08:29.051 --> 00:08:32.770
He married Laura cap on a daughter of a respected Jewish family with who it have

142
00:08:32.930 --> 00:08:34.170
two children in 1930,

143
00:08:34.171 --> 00:08:37.410
he made us first visit to America were elected on quantum theory.

144
00:08:37.600 --> 00:08:41.800
Shortly after firm seems to have decided the quantum field was becoming

145
00:08:41.870 --> 00:08:44.720
exhausted. He switched his focus to nuclear physics.

146
00:08:45.220 --> 00:08:49.640
It was this switch that would lead to his big breakthrough in 1934 firming and

147
00:08:49.760 --> 00:08:52.600
his team were researching the atom that already discovered that pretty much

148
00:08:52.650 --> 00:08:55.080
every element is capable of nuclear transformation.

149
00:08:55.580 --> 00:08:57.560
And we're now focusing on uranium.

150
00:08:57.740 --> 00:09:01.160
It was while working with the elements that firmly discovered the first step

151
00:09:01.161 --> 00:09:03.960
toward nuclear fishing. Since we are a history channel,

152
00:09:03.961 --> 00:09:07.640
rather than a science channel, we're not qualified to go deep into this,

153
00:09:07.980 --> 00:09:12.520
but the basic gist is that firmly made a breakthrough from which any garden

154
00:09:12.550 --> 00:09:14.320
variety genius could have deduced.

155
00:09:14.320 --> 00:09:17.950
A other breakthroughs could be made eventually leading to everything from

156
00:09:17.951 --> 00:09:22.030
nuclear reactors to atomic bombs. As the 2016 book,

157
00:09:22.031 --> 00:09:26.350
the Pope physics notes had firm's brain been firing in all cylinders at that

158
00:09:26.351 --> 00:09:31.230
time, it's likely nuclear efficient. Would've been discovered in Italy in 1935.

159
00:09:31.830 --> 00:09:36.260
One possible consequence is that Nazi Germany would've used that such to acquire

160
00:09:36.261 --> 00:09:40.220
nuclear weapons. It's a scary thought that out there, just a few degrees away.

161
00:09:40.330 --> 00:09:44.660
It's a parallel universe where the London blitz was not a sustained campaign,

162
00:09:44.680 --> 00:09:49.380
but a single bomb falling from the sky that turns the British capital into

163
00:09:49.740 --> 00:09:51.100
rubble in a flash of light.

164
00:09:51.410 --> 00:09:55.300
Luckily though we don't live in that universe in our universe firm's brain.

165
00:09:55.301 --> 00:09:57.850
For some reason, wasn't quite operating at full capacity.

166
00:09:58.490 --> 00:10:01.010
He merely thought he'd created a new element. One,

167
00:10:01.190 --> 00:10:03.650
the press argued should be named after mu Salini.

168
00:10:03.870 --> 00:10:07.610
By the time everyone figured out what was actually going on and he head start in

169
00:10:07.690 --> 00:10:11.890
Nazi, Germany could have got on the bomb was gone in terms of near misses.

170
00:10:11.920 --> 00:10:15.370
They don't get much nearer than that. Still firm's work was important.

171
00:10:15.371 --> 00:10:19.800
Important enough him to be awarded the Nobel prize in physics in 1938.

172
00:10:20.420 --> 00:10:25.040
And that's today's second stroke of good luck because 1938 was when everything

173
00:10:25.041 --> 00:10:29.680
went to hell that summer mu suddenly brought in a raft of anti-Jewish laws.

174
00:10:30.060 --> 00:10:31.400
So extreme worthy laws.

175
00:10:31.540 --> 00:10:36.480
So nakedly modeled on Hitler that they penetrated even Furies physics adult. My,

176
00:10:37.310 --> 00:10:39.110
although he was staunchly apolitical firmly,

177
00:10:39.111 --> 00:10:43.070
couldn't ignore the fact that these new laws targeted his wife and probably

178
00:10:43.071 --> 00:10:44.630
their children. Unfortunately,

179
00:10:44.810 --> 00:10:48.470
the new laws also made it impossible for Jews to leave Italy without a very good

180
00:10:48.471 --> 00:10:49.304
reason.

181
00:10:49.310 --> 00:10:54.270
A reason like while perhaps winning the Nobel prize that December firmly

182
00:10:54.271 --> 00:10:56.710
traveled to Sweden collect his Nobel prize for physics.

183
00:10:57.060 --> 00:10:58.220
He took his family with him,

184
00:10:58.280 --> 00:11:02.300
the no travel laws for Jews briefly waved on the understanding that the award

185
00:11:02.301 --> 00:11:04.740
would bring glory on Italy. In Stockholm,

186
00:11:05.180 --> 00:11:09.540
Bumi accepted his award that used his prize money to get himself his wife and

187
00:11:09.541 --> 00:11:11.900
his children on a boat to the USA.

188
00:11:12.160 --> 00:11:15.900
And that's how Italy's greatest modern scientist came to leave his country

189
00:11:15.920 --> 00:11:16.780
behind for good,

190
00:11:17.300 --> 00:11:21.370
his scary to think that had mu not suddenly passed those anti-Jewish laws.

191
00:11:22.050 --> 00:11:24.850
Firmi would've likely stayed in Italy for the duration of the war.

192
00:11:25.530 --> 00:11:27.850
All the I could do under rap Heimer would be lost.

193
00:11:28.160 --> 00:11:32.290
Lost two would be the world's first nuclear actor soon to be built under Firmi

194
00:11:32.490 --> 00:11:33.270
SW in Chicago.

195
00:11:33.270 --> 00:11:38.010
And Firmi was just one of thousands of scientists who fled the consonant in the

196
00:11:38.280 --> 00:11:42.040
those days had Europe's fascists not become so obsessed with the national

197
00:11:42.340 --> 00:11:46.880
purity. The nations would ironically have lasted much longer on January.

198
00:11:46.940 --> 00:11:51.040
The second, 1939. The firm arrived in New York city for the rest of their lives.

199
00:11:51.420 --> 00:11:54.360
They'd call America home. Now just before we continue today,

200
00:11:54.361 --> 00:11:56.960
I hope that you are not gonna be developing any nuclear bombs,

201
00:11:56.980 --> 00:11:59.680
but if you'd like to get a better grasp on physics,

202
00:11:59.940 --> 00:12:01.320
but let me tell you about brilliance.

203
00:12:01.321 --> 00:12:04.800
Brilliant is a problem solving based website and app with a hands on approach.

204
00:12:04.801 --> 00:12:09.120
They've got over 60 interactive courses in maths science and computer science.

205
00:12:09.140 --> 00:12:11.440
Now you've heard me talk about brilliant before on this channel,

206
00:12:11.470 --> 00:12:13.870
they teach you about this subjects I mentioned, but beyond that,

207
00:12:13.871 --> 00:12:16.830
they also teach you problem solving skills, which are practical.

208
00:12:17.020 --> 00:12:19.030
Even if you don't pursue the sciences,

209
00:12:19.470 --> 00:12:21.830
learning how to break down complex problems to their component.

210
00:12:21.840 --> 00:12:25.470
Parts is pretty critical in whatever career path you choose,

211
00:12:25.650 --> 00:12:28.310
or maybe you've wanted to learn programming that you've always been a bit

212
00:12:28.750 --> 00:12:29.350
daunted by it.

213
00:12:29.350 --> 00:12:33.420
Normally it requires you to learn the tedious details if a specific grooming

214
00:12:33.620 --> 00:12:34.120
language,

215
00:12:34.120 --> 00:12:38.180
but really the bedrock of it is understanding the fundamental algorithms on

216
00:12:38.181 --> 00:12:41.100
brilliant. You start by programming a drone with simple instructions,

217
00:12:41.101 --> 00:12:44.900
which teaches you the basic structure of every program you'll ever write.

218
00:12:45.010 --> 00:12:46.700
It's all drag and drop exercises,

219
00:12:46.701 --> 00:12:50.020
which will get you thinking like a computer scientist in no time.

220
00:12:50.160 --> 00:12:53.420
And that's just one example. There's loads of great stuff on their platform.

221
00:12:53.530 --> 00:12:57.850
Form. Look, brilliance is a great compliment to watching videos like this one,

222
00:12:57.851 --> 00:13:01.490
and it will really help you master even complex technical subjects.

227
00:13:22.200 --> 00:13:24.040
Barely had Firmi set foot inside Columbia,

228
00:13:24.350 --> 00:13:27.400
that he was already gifting his new government breakthroughs.

229
00:13:27.550 --> 00:13:29.320
That same spring 1939,

230
00:13:29.321 --> 00:13:33.040
the Italian in his team showed that emitting neutrons into uranium was the

231
00:13:33.041 --> 00:13:36.950
process of Phish. The, that could trigger a chain reaction. In other words,

232
00:13:37.970 --> 00:13:42.230
Kaboom by March the university was already writing to the Navy suggesting that

233
00:13:42.231 --> 00:13:46.350
this could be used as a weapon nor was firmly himself blind to this possibility.

234
00:13:46.690 --> 00:13:48.230
One day in a Manhattan high rise.

235
00:13:48.470 --> 00:13:52.510
He glanced out a window at the bustling city and Mert. This will bomb like that,

236
00:13:53.050 --> 00:13:54.990
and it would all disappear. But firm,

237
00:13:55.060 --> 00:13:58.100
he was no Oppenheimer tortured inside by the destruction.

238
00:13:58.240 --> 00:13:59.420
His research could reek.

239
00:13:59.520 --> 00:14:03.540
He actually went to Washington DC to personally try and drum up funding for

240
00:14:03.541 --> 00:14:04.740
nuclear weapons research.

241
00:14:05.080 --> 00:14:09.820
But his presentation was so singularly uncharismatic that he walked away with

242
00:14:09.980 --> 00:14:11.300
only the smallest of grants.

243
00:14:11.440 --> 00:14:15.140
It wasn't until Albertine Einstein personally wrote to Franklin D Roosevelt

244
00:14:15.141 --> 00:14:19.290
about the potential for super weapons that the American government began to

245
00:14:19.291 --> 00:14:22.170
really show some interest still. It was slow progress.

246
00:14:22.520 --> 00:14:23.690
Only on December the sixth,

247
00:14:23.970 --> 00:14:28.210
1941 was a project to study these theories in Chicago signed off on,

248
00:14:28.350 --> 00:14:31.850
but if things had been moving slowly for firm's research up until that point,

249
00:14:32.040 --> 00:14:36.010
they were about to gain a sense of extreme urgency. So you probably,

250
00:14:36.240 --> 00:14:39.160
you remember the history class, you know what happened on December the seventh,

251
00:14:39.600 --> 00:14:42.600
1941, the Japanese bombing of Pearl Harbor dragged America,

252
00:14:42.601 --> 00:14:45.160
kicking and screaming into the war.

253
00:14:45.380 --> 00:14:49.760
It also had the side effect that every Italian in the country was immediately

254
00:14:49.790 --> 00:14:53.880
classed as an enemy alien and subjected to severe travel restrictions.

255
00:14:54.100 --> 00:14:57.720
It took nearly six months for firm's restrictions to be waved for his research.

256
00:14:58.060 --> 00:15:01.800
He finally arrived in Chicago in summer 1942,

257
00:15:02.020 --> 00:15:05.560
but once he was there, Firmi almost immediately proved his worth.

258
00:15:05.980 --> 00:15:10.790
We already spoke of one terrifying parallel universe where the access got the

259
00:15:10.791 --> 00:15:13.310
bomb. Now we're going to speak about a much weirder one,

260
00:15:13.410 --> 00:15:16.470
the universe where this video isn't titled Enrique,

261
00:15:17.070 --> 00:15:18.750
Firmi the godfather of the atomic bomb,

262
00:15:19.270 --> 00:15:23.630
but ENCO Firmi the mad scientist who destroyed Chicago firm and his team

263
00:15:23.631 --> 00:15:27.150
assembled a nuclear reactor on the squash court of the university of Chicago

264
00:15:27.180 --> 00:15:29.710
towards the end of 1942 on December.

265
00:15:29.711 --> 00:15:33.380
The second they sent critical as the New York times later wrote of the

266
00:15:33.381 --> 00:15:34.820
potentially dangerous experiments,

267
00:15:35.000 --> 00:15:38.620
the only safeguards against an uncontrolled atomic chain reaction that would've

268
00:15:38.621 --> 00:15:42.420
irradiated a significant part of Chicago was a scientist wielding.

269
00:15:42.620 --> 00:15:45.420
And AXS cut the rope that held an emergency control.

270
00:15:45.520 --> 00:15:50.300
Rod suspended from the balcony and a few other brave volunteers whose job was to

271
00:15:50.310 --> 00:15:54.770
douse the runaway with buckets of neutron, absorbing Kam sulfate.

272
00:15:55.450 --> 00:15:58.050
Firmi actually jokes that if the reactor went out of control,

273
00:15:58.150 --> 00:16:02.570
the assembled deem should run and hide behind a big hill, many miles away.

274
00:16:02.790 --> 00:16:07.490
But of course, Chicago pile one didn't become chin noble before chin noble,

275
00:16:07.670 --> 00:16:10.890
it worked creating a self-sustaining atomic chain reaction.

276
00:16:11.350 --> 00:16:15.040
The first work king nuclear reactor in history shortly after a code was

277
00:16:15.041 --> 00:16:16.280
broadcast to Washington DC.

278
00:16:16.860 --> 00:16:21.760
The Italian navigator has just landed in the new world and that was the

279
00:16:21.761 --> 00:16:23.240
Dawn of the atomic age.

280
00:16:23.580 --> 00:16:28.280
And it was also the Dawn of a new age in firm's work in 1944,

281
00:16:28.300 --> 00:16:32.830
the Italian physicist became a naturalized us citizen shortly after he was sent

282
00:16:32.831 --> 00:16:36.630
down to Los Alamo MOS to work on the Manhattan project under Robert Oppenheimer

283
00:16:37.190 --> 00:16:39.950
Firmi was actually there on July the 16th, 1945.

284
00:16:39.951 --> 00:16:43.910
When the first Plutonian bomb was tested at the infamous Trinity test in Alamo

285
00:16:44.430 --> 00:16:47.630
Godo, New Mexico. This was the moment when Oppenheimer seeming the power.

286
00:16:47.650 --> 00:16:49.870
He had unleashed thought the phrase. Now.

287
00:16:49.870 --> 00:16:52.830
<v 4>I am become deaf the destroyer of world.</v>

288
00:16:53.560 --> 00:16:54.620
<v 0>But as we've said before,</v>

289
00:16:55.260 --> 00:16:59.100
Firmi was no Oppenheimer faced with the reality of a weapon capable of wiping

290
00:16:59.101 --> 00:17:00.900
out entire cities in the blink of an eye.

291
00:17:01.700 --> 00:17:06.020
Firmi only noted that the Trinity test was a labor of considerable scientific

292
00:17:06.300 --> 00:17:07.133
interest.

293
00:17:12.840 --> 00:17:14.650
In the last month of the Manassian project.

294
00:17:14.870 --> 00:17:18.210
Firm's dedication to building the bomb did not waiver. Although in April,

295
00:17:18.270 --> 00:17:22.170
he noted that their labors would one day be able to be reproduced by smaller

296
00:17:22.200 --> 00:17:23.490
nations or even groups.

297
00:17:23.830 --> 00:17:27.450
He still thought it a worthwhile endeavor that June he joined the scientific

298
00:17:27.451 --> 00:17:32.090
panel of the interim committee group task in part with advising on the use of

299
00:17:32.110 --> 00:17:33.490
atomic weapons against Japan,

300
00:17:33.680 --> 00:17:37.200
just colleagues firmly advocated for an atomic strike.

301
00:17:37.600 --> 00:17:40.760
Although some members of the panel did object unethical grounds preferring

302
00:17:40.761 --> 00:17:43.160
instead, a public test that would give Japan warning.

303
00:17:43.190 --> 00:17:47.560
President Harry Truman signed off on the attack just two months later on August

304
00:17:47.620 --> 00:17:48.880
the sixth, 1945,

305
00:17:49.360 --> 00:17:54.000
a bomb distilled from the work Firmi Oppenheimer and the other geniuses at Las

306
00:17:54.480 --> 00:17:58.880
Alamos was loaded onto the Enola gay and flown off into the night sky.

307
00:17:59.300 --> 00:18:03.680
Six hours later, the ano gays Bombay doors opened above the commercial ends.

308
00:18:03.840 --> 00:18:07.840
Military city of Hiroshima, little boy dropped for 44 seconds.

309
00:18:08.530 --> 00:18:11.230
At the end of that time, the world changed forever.

310
00:18:11.610 --> 00:18:15.590
The first atomic bomb ever used in warfare was detonated precisely 16 minutes

311
00:18:15.730 --> 00:18:20.230
and two seconds past eight in the morning, some 609 meters above Hiroshima.

312
00:18:20.330 --> 00:18:21.950
Within 0.1 of a second,

313
00:18:22.290 --> 00:18:27.230
the air over the city center had reached 277,760 degrees

314
00:18:27.340 --> 00:18:28.173
Celsius.

315
00:18:28.270 --> 00:18:32.300
A woman sat nearly a kilometer away on the banks of the city's river was

316
00:18:32.330 --> 00:18:33.500
instantly vaporized.

317
00:18:33.760 --> 00:18:38.300
As the fire expanded granite stones melted the internal organs of humans and

318
00:18:38.301 --> 00:18:42.300
animals, vaporized and exposed skin was simply burned off.

319
00:18:42.680 --> 00:18:47.020
By the time a single second had passed a blast wave traveling 1,500 kilometers

320
00:18:47.021 --> 00:18:49.060
an hour had torn the clothes off,

321
00:18:49.061 --> 00:18:53.690
nearly everyone in the city destroyed 60,000 buildings and an

322
00:18:53.691 --> 00:18:58.450
intense fast storm that started that would rage the hours and hours in that

323
00:18:58.810 --> 00:19:03.650
instant 80,000 people died including up to 20,000 Korean slave laborers and over

324
00:19:03.770 --> 00:19:05.130
a dozen allied POWs,

325
00:19:05.520 --> 00:19:09.570
many tens of thousands would die of radiation poisoning over the coming weeks.

326
00:19:10.100 --> 00:19:14.560
It was carnage on a previously unimaginable scale and it wasn't over

327
00:19:14.890 --> 00:19:16.400
three days later on August the ninth,

328
00:19:16.401 --> 00:19:18.800
another plane carrying another bomb flew over Japan.

329
00:19:18.970 --> 00:19:22.240
Originally it was meant to drop its payload on the ancient city of Kora,

330
00:19:22.460 --> 00:19:26.920
but thick cloud meant that Nagasaki became its target at 11:02 AM.

331
00:19:27.060 --> 00:19:31.190
Fatman exploded above the port city turning 40,000 into Ash.

332
00:19:31.490 --> 00:19:32.290
It was the seconds.

333
00:19:32.290 --> 00:19:35.910
And to date the last time atomic weapons have been used in warfare,

334
00:19:36.570 --> 00:19:40.230
six days later, Japan surrendered unconditionally today,

335
00:19:40.330 --> 00:19:44.270
it remains up for debate whether the real motivation for Japanese surrender was

336
00:19:44.271 --> 00:19:48.790
the two atomic bombs or the SRS declaration of war on the same day as

337
00:19:48.950 --> 00:19:50.550
Nagasaki, whatever the truth,

338
00:19:50.730 --> 00:19:55.340
the is no denying that the weapons Firmey helped build had just shocked the

339
00:19:55.341 --> 00:19:59.260
world. By now, though, the war was already over in Europe, in Italy,

340
00:19:59.460 --> 00:20:03.340
partisans had captured mu stringing up his corpse in a Milan square Hitler.

341
00:20:03.660 --> 00:20:07.100
Two was dead killed by a self-inflicted gunshot in his fewer bunker.

342
00:20:07.200 --> 00:20:11.060
The fascist suit chased Firmey and his family out of Europe were gone.

343
00:20:11.570 --> 00:20:15.210
Physicist could now go back to his home country whenever he chose,

344
00:20:15.710 --> 00:20:17.130
but what remains Italy for him?

345
00:20:17.270 --> 00:20:21.090
His wife's family who were killed in the Holocaust, Rome Le and ruins.

346
00:20:21.480 --> 00:20:23.610
Instead in fall of 1945,

347
00:20:24.210 --> 00:20:26.930
Firmi accepted a teaching position at the university of Chicago.

348
00:20:27.510 --> 00:20:30.210
He would live in that city for the rest of his life.

349
00:20:36.900 --> 00:20:40.320
The last years of ENCO firm's life were marked by a returns.

350
00:20:40.340 --> 00:20:44.080
The Magine like fascination that characterized his earlier years at Chicago.

351
00:20:44.220 --> 00:20:47.760
He moved on from nuclear physics and began researching elementary particles

352
00:20:47.761 --> 00:20:49.720
before becoming obsessed with cosmic race.

353
00:20:49.790 --> 00:20:54.000
Perhaps his most famous contribution to science in this time though came not in

354
00:20:54.001 --> 00:20:56.560
the form of a discovery, but of a question,

355
00:20:57.010 --> 00:21:01.280
where is everybody in 1950 permi was launching with some colleagues when they

356
00:21:01.281 --> 00:21:03.240
began to discuss alien civilizations.

357
00:21:03.660 --> 00:21:06.750
It was three years after the supposed Roswell crash at the line.

358
00:21:06.751 --> 00:21:08.230
When UFOs ruled the rage,

359
00:21:08.650 --> 00:21:12.590
one by one firm's friends asserted that there were undoubtedly aliens out there

360
00:21:12.591 --> 00:21:15.470
in the galaxy. It was at this point firmly asked his question,

361
00:21:15.800 --> 00:21:20.670
where is everybody may sound like a flip remark, but Firmi had a serious point.

362
00:21:20.940 --> 00:21:23.750
He'd realized that given the immense age of the galaxy,

363
00:21:23.930 --> 00:21:28.140
any civilization with even the most rudimentary rocket analogy should have

364
00:21:28.141 --> 00:21:32.780
colonized it by now assuming even a hyper conservative estimate for how often an

365
00:21:32.781 --> 00:21:34.540
intelligent civilization arises,

366
00:21:34.800 --> 00:21:39.460
the sheer timescales involved meant there should be abundant evidence of aliens

367
00:21:39.480 --> 00:21:43.060
by now. So again, where is everyone today?

368
00:21:43.061 --> 00:21:47.340
That simple question is known as the firmly paradox and the list of explanations

369
00:21:47.590 --> 00:21:52.410
as to why there are no signs of alien life could fill a dozen videos all by

370
00:21:52.411 --> 00:21:55.530
themselves. Seriously, if you want to go down an infinite click,

371
00:21:55.810 --> 00:21:59.570
I'll just type the great filter or dark forest theory into Google.

372
00:22:00.050 --> 00:22:03.250
But while Firmey may have MedEd in many disciplines in his later years,

373
00:22:03.270 --> 00:22:07.850
he could never quite escape the one running threat through his working

374
00:22:08.070 --> 00:22:10.720
life nuclear physics in 1949,

375
00:22:11.120 --> 00:22:14.600
Firmi joins the general advisory committee to the atomic energy commission that

376
00:22:14.800 --> 00:22:16.960
year. The S R had tested its fast atomic weapon.

377
00:22:17.320 --> 00:22:20.560
And the committee had gathered to decide on the practical ands moral

378
00:22:20.561 --> 00:22:24.120
implications of the USA, developing thermonuclear devices.

379
00:22:24.180 --> 00:22:28.040
Unlike the atomic bombing of Japan Firmi was steadfastly against the idea

380
00:22:28.790 --> 00:22:29.330
hydrogen bomb.

381
00:22:29.330 --> 00:22:33.110
He wrote in a dissension from the majority opinion becomes a weapon,

382
00:22:33.160 --> 00:22:36.110
which in practical effect is almost one of genocide.

383
00:22:36.290 --> 00:22:41.070
It is necessarily an evil thing considered in any light after

384
00:22:41.190 --> 00:22:43.270
a lifetime with no political opinions at all,

385
00:22:43.470 --> 00:22:47.710
li seemed en Rico Firmey was finally waking up to a world where governments

386
00:22:47.880 --> 00:22:51.180
might use as discoveries for evil, but this new mindset,

387
00:22:51.640 --> 00:22:54.740
it only went so far when Truman signed off on the H bomb.

388
00:22:55.300 --> 00:22:58.260
Firmi beautifully went back to Los Alamos to work on it.

389
00:22:58.520 --> 00:23:02.380
It is said he hope to prove such a weapon was impossible. If that's the case,

390
00:23:03.020 --> 00:23:04.020
when he was doomed to disappointment,

391
00:23:04.400 --> 00:23:08.700
the world's first hydrogen bomb was tested in the Marshall Islands on November

392
00:23:08.700 --> 00:23:10.650
1st, 1952, the exploit was so vast.

393
00:23:11.110 --> 00:23:14.690
So world changing in its implications that it graced the cover of time.

394
00:23:15.290 --> 00:23:19.330
Not long after that firme came up with his own pessimistic answer to the Firmi

395
00:23:19.331 --> 00:23:20.020
paradox.

396
00:23:20.020 --> 00:23:24.250
There were no alien civilizations because they'd all wiped themselves out with

397
00:23:24.251 --> 00:23:28.250
Thermo nuclear weapons, still Firmi being Firmi. He carried on working.

398
00:23:28.770 --> 00:23:32.280
There were doubtless more discovery he's out there to be made in the summer of

399
00:23:32.440 --> 00:23:34.440
1954, even went back to Italy,

400
00:23:34.441 --> 00:23:37.520
hiking in the mountains and enjoying the air of the old country.

401
00:23:38.060 --> 00:23:41.080
At least that was his plan. The reality was firm.

402
00:23:41.240 --> 00:23:43.360
He found himself feeling constantly run down.

403
00:23:43.550 --> 00:23:45.640
When he returned to Chicago at the end end of his vacation,

404
00:23:46.100 --> 00:23:47.160
he went straight to the doctor.

405
00:23:47.650 --> 00:23:50.760
Since you can already see we're nearing the end of this video,

406
00:23:51.020 --> 00:23:54.680
you can probably guess what came next. The doctor told firm me,

407
00:23:54.780 --> 00:23:57.280
he had stomach cancer, although they tried to cure it.

408
00:23:57.500 --> 00:24:02.480
The disease was already farty advanced ENCO Firmi died on November the 28th,

409
00:24:02.840 --> 00:24:05.630
1954. He was 53 today.

410
00:24:06.110 --> 00:24:09.990
Firm's name lives on most notably in the paradox named after him and the element

411
00:24:10.590 --> 00:24:14.150
firm discovered in 1953, while it's doubtful.

412
00:24:14.151 --> 00:24:15.790
The average Joe has heard of him.

413
00:24:15.890 --> 00:24:20.310
He remains highly respected genius who still gets his due yet.

414
00:24:20.311 --> 00:24:24.070
It's interesting to recall just how unlikely this great reputation was.

415
00:24:24.490 --> 00:24:28.820
If things been just a shade different for me could have gone down in history as

416
00:24:28.821 --> 00:24:31.420
the man who accidentally gave the access the bomb,

417
00:24:31.760 --> 00:24:35.940
or he could have become trapped in Italy in 1938 and perished alongside his wife

418
00:24:35.941 --> 00:24:36.780
in the Holocaust.

419
00:24:36.960 --> 00:24:41.180
He may have even made it to America only to send Chicago pile one out of control

420
00:24:41.360 --> 00:24:44.500
and caused the world's first nuclear meltdown. Thankfully,

421
00:24:44.610 --> 00:24:49.490
this universe is one where disaster never struck where firm's genius helped

422
00:24:49.491 --> 00:24:53.690
shape the world rather than end it. He may have lived a relatively short life,

423
00:24:53.790 --> 00:24:58.330
but Firmi did enough work in his five decades to fill hundreds of lifetimes.

424
00:24:58.950 --> 00:25:01.090
