00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.760
<v 0>Just before we get started with today's video.</v>

2
00:00:01.880 --> 00:00:06.160
I do wanna say that it's brought to you by me or rather another channel that I

3
00:00:06.180 --> 00:00:09.640
do call business blaze. It's about business, but it's interesting.

4
00:00:09.700 --> 00:00:11.840
But like I say, at some point when this channel's huge,

5
00:00:11.870 --> 00:00:15.640
what I will do is I will sell these old scripts and I'll donate all the money to

6
00:00:15.641 --> 00:00:18.120
a charity that does like environmental something.

7
00:00:18.380 --> 00:00:21.150
So if this channel's not successful, you're destroying the environment,

8
00:00:21.470 --> 00:00:21.810
tell a friend,

9
00:00:21.810 --> 00:00:24.390
it looks at the most epic failures and the things that went wrong,

10
00:00:24.410 --> 00:00:26.310
but also little known success stories.

11
00:00:26.420 --> 00:00:29.550
Generally just the weirdest stuff I find from the business world.

12
00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:33.590
<v 1>Like why the 50 pound note in the UK is just for criminals, stuff like that.</v>

13
00:00:33.620 --> 00:00:34.990
It's more laid back than this channel,

14
00:00:34.991 --> 00:00:39.030
throwing a good amount of silliness and fun at you. Along with some facts,

15
00:00:39.490 --> 00:00:42.700
she is the queen. She it's like sh she should be wearing a crown.

16
00:00:42.770 --> 00:00:46.660
Like Tiara's like a light day. Check it out through the link below.

17
00:00:47.260 --> 00:00:48.540
Now let's get into today's video.

18
00:00:54.690 --> 00:00:57.700
<v 0>Imagine the scenario, you have an adorable grandmother,</v>

19
00:00:57.810 --> 00:01:01.260
beloved by friends and family. She tends to her roses.

20
00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:05.130
She bakes pies and grows her own vegetables. You know,

21
00:01:05.150 --> 00:01:07.410
she works for some sort of government's outfit,

22
00:01:07.480 --> 00:01:11.370
something to do with science and metals. You know that now.

23
00:01:11.371 --> 00:01:14.210
And then she takes long trips to the other side of town.

24
00:01:14.590 --> 00:01:18.050
You don't know exactly where she is going or who she is meeting,

25
00:01:18.590 --> 00:01:20.290
but she always looks excited.

26
00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:23.880
Then one day you wake up and you find her name in the papers.

27
00:01:24.230 --> 00:01:27.840
Evidently your grandmother has been spying for your country's enemies.

28
00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:31.760
The USS R this is what happens to today's protagonist.

29
00:01:32.360 --> 00:01:34.400
Malita Norwood beloved secretary, mother,

30
00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:39.160
grandmother ands great grandmother who for 40 years delivered nuclear

31
00:01:39.190 --> 00:01:43.430
secrets to the Soviet union. During the height, the cold war

32
00:01:50.230 --> 00:01:53.190
Maita Norwood was born ma Cerna on March the 25th,

33
00:01:53.590 --> 00:01:57.470
1912 in born with England. Her parents were Alexander Cerna,

34
00:01:57.750 --> 00:02:01.110
Saint latian EMREs, Gertrude Steadman and English suffrage,

35
00:02:01.310 --> 00:02:03.340
jet Alexandra at an interesting back round.

36
00:02:03.440 --> 00:02:07.700
He had worked as a secretary for literal giants, Leon Tolstoy,

37
00:02:07.701 --> 00:02:10.380
author of Warren and peace among other masterpieces,

38
00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:14.460
but he had to flee from the final days of the Russian empire because of his

39
00:02:14.461 --> 00:02:16.580
revolutionary leanings. As an exile,

40
00:02:16.600 --> 00:02:20.540
he found employment as an estate manager for Totos literary executor,

41
00:02:20.541 --> 00:02:21.660
Vladimir shutoff.

42
00:02:21.670 --> 00:02:25.210
Eventually he followed his employer of the village of tuck and Hampshire

43
00:02:25.490 --> 00:02:26.160
Southern England.

44
00:02:26.160 --> 00:02:29.770
This was a place that was home to numerous Russian expats here.

45
00:02:30.050 --> 00:02:34.930
Chat cov founded a colony organized in line with Toto and principles of domestic

46
00:02:35.140 --> 00:02:38.770
simplicity and strict nonviolence in which personal possessions were

47
00:02:38.771 --> 00:02:41.330
discouraged. While INTAN Alexander heard,

48
00:02:41.331 --> 00:02:44.960
also joins the social democratic Federation, a small Marxist group.

49
00:02:45.020 --> 00:02:47.280
He did have socialist and communist leanings,

50
00:02:47.281 --> 00:02:49.040
but in line with the colony principles,

51
00:02:49.220 --> 00:02:51.760
he did not approve of revolutionary methods.

52
00:02:51.820 --> 00:02:53.920
At least not until the first world war.

53
00:02:53.950 --> 00:02:57.760
This was a watershed moment for many leftists across Englands and Europe,

54
00:02:57.770 --> 00:03:02.200
which led to them becoming disillusions with Alliance colonialism and the

55
00:03:02.201 --> 00:03:05.280
political realities of the late 19th and early 20th centuries.

56
00:03:05.420 --> 00:03:06.880
In October of 1917,

57
00:03:07.520 --> 00:03:11.880
Alexander looked on in admiration at the events unfolding in Petrograd the

58
00:03:11.881 --> 00:03:15.440
Russian revolution of which he became a vocal supporter. His boss,

59
00:03:15.800 --> 00:03:20.150
Chuck of was recalled to Moscow by Lennon to cure rate the publishing of Totos

60
00:03:20.151 --> 00:03:24.990
social essays much liked by the Sevick Alexander could not join him as

61
00:03:24.991 --> 00:03:26.350
he fell ill with tuberculosis,

62
00:03:26.351 --> 00:03:30.470
eventually dying on arm to stay November the 11th, 1918.

63
00:03:30.690 --> 00:03:34.710
Did Alexander's communist sympathies have an impact on Malta's later life?

64
00:03:35.090 --> 00:03:37.230
For sure, father and daughter had a close bond,

65
00:03:37.370 --> 00:03:40.020
but Malita was only at the time of his death,

66
00:03:40.380 --> 00:03:44.300
probably too young to grasp the implications of revolutionary socialism.

67
00:03:44.330 --> 00:03:45.163
However,

68
00:03:45.240 --> 00:03:48.740
we should not discount the influence of the broader environment that she grew up

69
00:03:48.741 --> 00:03:52.660
in. She later described her childhood in the tuck and colony as idyllic,

70
00:03:52.661 --> 00:03:56.060
which may have given milita a rose tinted view of communism.

71
00:03:56.170 --> 00:04:01.130
This view was reinforced by mom Gerrie to consistent referenced communism as

72
00:04:01.210 --> 00:04:03.730
a utopian ideology on a more practical level.

73
00:04:04.210 --> 00:04:08.930
Gertrude gave to Malita an early taste of covert operations for the greater

74
00:04:08.931 --> 00:04:11.450
course of Bolshevism throughout Mali's childhood.

75
00:04:11.670 --> 00:04:15.890
She acted as a secret conduit between the party and Moscow and British communist

76
00:04:15.891 --> 00:04:17.490
headquarters in king street, London,

77
00:04:17.710 --> 00:04:21.800
she and fellow party members even recruited communists to be sent to Moscow,

78
00:04:21.801 --> 00:04:23.000
to train as undercover.

79
00:04:23.001 --> 00:04:26.600
Radio operators mal grew up to become a bright young girl,

80
00:04:26.610 --> 00:04:30.920
which she proved in 1923, by winning a scholarship to attend ITIN school,

81
00:04:31.230 --> 00:04:35.040
secondary school near south Hampton in Southern England in 1928,

82
00:04:35.260 --> 00:04:39.120
she was appointed school captain a promising achievement to her future academic

83
00:04:39.121 --> 00:04:42.190
career upon graduation in, in September of 1930,

84
00:04:42.790 --> 00:04:45.110
milita enrolled in Southampton university college,

85
00:04:45.330 --> 00:04:48.510
but she didn't really thrive there at the urging of her mother.

86
00:04:48.730 --> 00:04:51.310
She had signed up for logic and Latin two courses.

87
00:04:51.570 --> 00:04:55.150
She eventually came to dislike. Apparently during the first year at uni,

88
00:04:55.510 --> 00:04:57.910
your milita learns was how to ride a motorcycle.

89
00:04:58.050 --> 00:05:02.100
She eventually quit her courses and moved to Paris to a, her mother's despair.

90
00:05:02.240 --> 00:05:03.620
In the spring of 1931,

91
00:05:04.220 --> 00:05:07.980
Gertrud managed to drag Malita and her younger sister GTI to Heidelberg Germany

92
00:05:08.320 --> 00:05:10.220
in an effort to have her resume her studies.

93
00:05:10.560 --> 00:05:14.420
It was futile this time milita picked up a new passion field hockey.

94
00:05:14.980 --> 00:05:17.300
She and Gerty joined a team coached by professor MUN,

95
00:05:17.820 --> 00:05:19.900
head of an anatomy at Heidelberg university.

96
00:05:19.960 --> 00:05:23.730
The son family became go had friends with the professor left wing,

97
00:05:23.731 --> 00:05:25.890
social Democrat, and anti-Nazi activist.

98
00:05:26.150 --> 00:05:29.490
The sound is girls joined him in many demonstrations against the national

99
00:05:29.560 --> 00:05:33.450
socialist party during which they came face to face with the essay,

100
00:05:33.630 --> 00:05:36.770
the brown shirts, but luckily were not involved in any violence.

101
00:05:37.220 --> 00:05:41.050
These are the moments that shaped Millet's leftist stance.

102
00:05:41.360 --> 00:05:45.720
Socialism was the only sensible counterweight to the rise of authoritarian

103
00:05:45.790 --> 00:05:46.623
regimes in Europe.

104
00:05:53.200 --> 00:05:57.240
1932 was a watershed moment for Malita and don't forget. She was only 20.

105
00:05:57.260 --> 00:05:58.160
At this point here,

106
00:05:58.220 --> 00:06:01.320
she displayed strong leadership skills by becoming an organizer for the

107
00:06:01.321 --> 00:06:04.720
association of women, clerks and secretaries. During this period,

108
00:06:05.020 --> 00:06:09.120
she also married her fiance, Hillary Nuba, who later ized,

109
00:06:09.260 --> 00:06:13.840
he and his wife surnamed Norwood mil was clearly allergic to spare time because

110
00:06:13.841 --> 00:06:17.590
in 1932, milita also became a member of the indu, a Penant labor party.

111
00:06:17.730 --> 00:06:19.670
And joining one party may not have been enough.

112
00:06:19.671 --> 00:06:21.670
According to his story and Christopher Andrew,

113
00:06:22.390 --> 00:06:24.270
Malita had a more covert Alliance,

114
00:06:24.790 --> 00:06:27.150
a secret member of the communist party of gray Britain.

115
00:06:27.450 --> 00:06:29.590
We will meet Christopher Andrew again later,

116
00:06:29.890 --> 00:06:33.510
and you'll see why the Intrepid historian is so relevant to our story.

117
00:06:33.810 --> 00:06:38.580
But for the moment let's shift our attention to another or Andrew here he is our

118
00:06:38.581 --> 00:06:41.060
second Andrew making his entrance stage left. Of course,

119
00:06:41.280 --> 00:06:42.860
his name is Andrew Rothstein,

120
00:06:42.880 --> 00:06:47.860
and he has introduced to milita by none other than her mother GUTR milita

121
00:06:47.861 --> 00:06:51.340
and Rothstein became close friends. Some might even say intimate friends,

122
00:06:51.470 --> 00:06:55.580
their meetings were usually carefully planned to prevent prying eyes from taking

123
00:06:55.940 --> 00:06:59.330
too closer notice of where their hands were laying or what their lips were

124
00:06:59.331 --> 00:07:03.130
whispering. There wasn't anything untoward in this two friend's relationship.

125
00:07:03.240 --> 00:07:07.410
Well, at least nothing that would count as adultery Rossine was in fact,

126
00:07:07.530 --> 00:07:11.770
a Soviet secret agents. He was Millet's recruiter ands first handler,

127
00:07:11.790 --> 00:07:16.170
the one who put her into contact with the NK V D Stalin's secret police and the

128
00:07:16.171 --> 00:07:19.000
precaster to the KGB. Thanks to Roth steam's influence.

129
00:07:19.680 --> 00:07:22.760
Malita had begun to spy on the UK scientific and military community.

130
00:07:23.020 --> 00:07:24.320
On behalf of the Soviets,

131
00:07:24.580 --> 00:07:29.480
her code name was ho in addition to her broader pro communism political

132
00:07:29.481 --> 00:07:30.090
motives,

133
00:07:30.090 --> 00:07:34.600
she'd heard a world in which Western Europe and later the us were told exclusive

134
00:07:34.680 --> 00:07:36.240
unchallenged nuclear power

135
00:07:42.680 --> 00:07:47.150
Agent Ho's initial role was to work with the Soviet aspiring operating inside.

136
00:07:47.170 --> 00:07:51.950
The role will it AAL in London, this vital plant was dedicated to manufacturing,

137
00:07:51.951 --> 00:07:53.350
heavy guns for Naval use,

138
00:07:53.370 --> 00:07:56.950
as well as field guns and other artillery equipment for the army for a while,

139
00:07:56.960 --> 00:08:00.140
everything went smoothly. But in Jan Henry 1938,

140
00:08:00.580 --> 00:08:03.860
MI five intervened for those not familiar with the organization of British

141
00:08:03.861 --> 00:08:04.820
secret services.

142
00:08:05.420 --> 00:08:09.260
MI five is the agency in charge of domestic security encounter espionage.

143
00:08:09.540 --> 00:08:11.940
While I six leads overseas operation.

144
00:08:11.941 --> 00:08:15.100
When I five got wins of the league of secrets from the arsenal,

145
00:08:15.101 --> 00:08:18.100
they arrested the three leading members of that ring. Interestingly,

146
00:08:18.160 --> 00:08:20.930
at this stage, they could have easily got a hold of holler,

147
00:08:21.110 --> 00:08:25.410
but she escaped their net. Her secret power was fantastically ordinary.

148
00:08:25.510 --> 00:08:29.690
She was a woman facing condescending male agents who could not fathom that a

149
00:08:29.691 --> 00:08:32.090
young secretary could be capable of spying,

150
00:08:32.270 --> 00:08:35.650
but let me give you some more details in the early 1930s,

151
00:08:35.930 --> 00:08:40.800
am I five agent Maxwell Knight was probably the only operative who women made

152
00:08:40.801 --> 00:08:44.280
better spies than men. That is why he recruited Mona mourns.

153
00:08:44.281 --> 00:08:46.440
The middle class daughter of a retired officer.

154
00:08:46.740 --> 00:08:49.760
Her mission was to infiltrate the British communist party as a typist.

155
00:08:50.230 --> 00:08:54.120
Mona had a quality for observing anything while other people partly took.

156
00:08:54.121 --> 00:08:57.800
Notice of fact, this is how she began suspecting Malita would be involved.

157
00:08:57.980 --> 00:09:00.800
She seemed to be a very active member in the party,

158
00:09:00.980 --> 00:09:05.360
but was prone to along disappearances from time to time MoFA reports with Knight

159
00:09:05.361 --> 00:09:06.480
who trusted her intuition,

160
00:09:06.700 --> 00:09:10.080
but when Knight briefed his superior Jasper Harker the reports,

161
00:09:10.220 --> 00:09:11.240
it was just ignored.

162
00:09:11.380 --> 00:09:15.270
Harker believes that women could not make spies and concluded that Norwood was

163
00:09:15.490 --> 00:09:19.110
simply not worth investigating. Following this close brush with the enemy,

164
00:09:19.250 --> 00:09:23.470
the NK VD handlers advised milita to go on ice until further notice,

165
00:09:23.820 --> 00:09:27.790
knowing her aversion to inaction. It must have been agony.

166
00:09:27.860 --> 00:09:30.590
Luckily for milita her time on the bench, it was short.

167
00:09:30.770 --> 00:09:32.750
She resumed her duties as holler. Again,

168
00:09:32.751 --> 00:09:35.420
just a few months later in may of 19 Yate.

169
00:09:35.770 --> 00:09:40.100
Then the following year Rothstein transitions is handling duties to a recently

170
00:09:40.101 --> 00:09:41.020
immigrated agents.

171
00:09:41.200 --> 00:09:45.500
Ursula Burton Ursula had landed in great Britain posing as a German Jewish

172
00:09:45.501 --> 00:09:47.420
refugee flee from the Nazis.

173
00:09:47.421 --> 00:09:52.340
And she quickly established a new Soviet Sping code named Sonya this new

174
00:09:52.341 --> 00:09:57.090
ring reported not only to the NK V D but also the less known G U

175
00:09:57.310 --> 00:10:00.570
the Soviet military intelligence agency by 1941.

176
00:10:00.590 --> 00:10:04.250
The Sonya ring included our protagonist milita among its ranks,

177
00:10:04.251 --> 00:10:07.410
as well as notorious double agents. Klauss forks,

178
00:10:07.610 --> 00:10:11.410
a German dissonant scientist who publicly supported the British war effort only

179
00:10:11.430 --> 00:10:15.250
to defect the Soviet to delayed stage. Now, I be wondering at this point,

180
00:10:15.280 --> 00:10:20.000
what could these strategic military value of a secretary working for the BN F M

181
00:10:20.040 --> 00:10:22.640
R a possibly beat? And while we're asking questions,

182
00:10:22.860 --> 00:10:26.040
why were the Soviet spying on the UK during world war II?

183
00:10:26.330 --> 00:10:29.800
After all they're supposed to be allies, let's start with the second point.

184
00:10:30.160 --> 00:10:33.400
The UK S S R Alliance was not a given at the start of the war.

185
00:10:33.620 --> 00:10:36.440
The ribbon TRO mullet of packed of August,

186
00:10:36.440 --> 00:10:40.430
1939 had formally tied Germany and the Soviets in an opportunistic anti Polish

187
00:10:40.830 --> 00:10:45.270
Alliance. It wasn't until the onset of operation Barbara Rosa in June, 1941,

188
00:10:45.271 --> 00:10:46.430
that the UK ends later,

189
00:10:46.490 --> 00:10:50.430
the us had linked arms with Stalin in order to defeat the access powers.

190
00:10:50.550 --> 00:10:52.430
Moreover, by the early 1940s,

191
00:10:52.650 --> 00:10:56.910
all the major powers had kickstarted their atomic programs and the Soviets had

192
00:10:57.140 --> 00:11:01.300
scruples about spying on their allies to get a head start in the business of

193
00:11:01.301 --> 00:11:03.380
splitting atoms. As for our other question,

194
00:11:04.220 --> 00:11:06.940
milita worked very closely with the director of BN FM,

195
00:11:07.100 --> 00:11:11.500
a a man by the name of G Bailey Bailey was a member of the advisory committee

196
00:11:11.560 --> 00:11:15.820
for another company, tube allies, but this, or rather innocent. And dare I say,

197
00:11:15.900 --> 00:11:20.090
boringly named company was de front for the British atomic bomb project.

198
00:11:20.430 --> 00:11:23.570
The link between the two companies was strengthened in March, 1945,

199
00:11:23.571 --> 00:11:26.850
when BN FM R a won a contract from two allies,

200
00:11:26.950 --> 00:11:30.850
it was Malta's biggest opportunity yet she would sneak into her boss's office

201
00:11:31.120 --> 00:11:34.650
open as safe and take pictures of the classified documents with a miniature

202
00:11:34.651 --> 00:11:37.050
camera, which she would then deliver to our handlers.

203
00:11:37.310 --> 00:11:41.480
The G U is pleased to describing the findings as of great interest and a

204
00:11:41.680 --> 00:11:44.600
valuable contribution to the developments of work in this field.

205
00:11:44.900 --> 00:11:48.040
The KGB chipped in describing Norwood as a committed,

206
00:11:48.440 --> 00:11:52.320
reliable and disciplined agent striving to be of the utmost assistance.

207
00:11:52.720 --> 00:11:54.680
Honestly, this sounds a bit Blands,

208
00:11:54.681 --> 00:11:58.160
the kind of feedback you'd get from a board boss at a midyear review,

209
00:11:58.260 --> 00:12:02.600
the kinds that ends with solid performance as an appraisal and across a coffee

210
00:12:02.601 --> 00:12:04.120
voucher as a bonus. However,

211
00:12:04.260 --> 00:12:08.440
the Soviet secret services really did hold Malta's work an extremely high esteem

212
00:12:08.610 --> 00:12:10.360
journalist and personal acquaintance.

213
00:12:11.200 --> 00:12:14.470
David Burke tells us that the information she supplied on the behavior of

214
00:12:14.500 --> 00:12:18.430
uranium metal at high temperatures permitted the Soviet union to test an atomic

215
00:12:18.431 --> 00:12:22.390
bomb four years earlier than British and American intelligence thought possible.

216
00:12:22.850 --> 00:12:23.480
So yes,

217
00:12:23.480 --> 00:12:26.990
quite an impressive contribution from our girl Malita without her efforts,

218
00:12:26.991 --> 00:12:30.310
the Soviets would've lagged four years behind the west in their development of a

219
00:12:30.311 --> 00:12:32.910
nuclear arsenal, Malita gave the Soviets quality and,

220
00:12:33.780 --> 00:12:35.900
but she also gave them quantity two, our mystery,

221
00:12:36.140 --> 00:12:39.380
French Christopher Andrew would go on to claim that Norwood was both the most

222
00:12:39.381 --> 00:12:44.220
important British female agent in KGB history and the longest serving of all

223
00:12:44.221 --> 00:12:45.420
Soviet spies in Britain.

224
00:12:51.880 --> 00:12:55.330
The end of world war II soon gave way to the threat of another conflict.

225
00:12:55.331 --> 00:12:59.530
The cold war as the Western and communist blocks began a decade song staring

226
00:12:59.531 --> 00:13:01.490
contest from either side of the eyeing curtain.

227
00:13:01.930 --> 00:13:04.610
M I five began increasing their scrutiny of suspected agents.

228
00:13:04.611 --> 00:13:08.290
Cancer intelligence was clearly on the right path twice in 1947.

229
00:13:08.291 --> 00:13:12.450
They questioned Ursula Burton Sonya's ring leader that on both occasions,

230
00:13:12.560 --> 00:13:15.360
they did not have enough hard to really do anything.

231
00:13:15.640 --> 00:13:18.600
The EIN knew that it was only a matter of time before the handcuffs snapped on

232
00:13:18.601 --> 00:13:20.720
her wrists. So she absconded to east Germany.

233
00:13:20.980 --> 00:13:25.240
Her star agent Klaus Fox was less lucky or perhaps less skilled.

234
00:13:25.300 --> 00:13:28.760
He was arrested in 1950 with Sonya slowly melting around her.

235
00:13:29.280 --> 00:13:32.080
Milita received orders to go on ice for a second time. Once again,

236
00:13:32.260 --> 00:13:34.830
her hibernation did not last long by 1951.

237
00:13:34.850 --> 00:13:39.270
She resumed espionage activities with additional cold to or precautions over the

238
00:13:39.271 --> 00:13:39.970
next few years.

239
00:13:39.970 --> 00:13:43.670
The pages of Mali's life flipped one after the other on the surface,

240
00:13:43.930 --> 00:13:47.790
not much happened beyond a normal suburban life to our friends and family.

241
00:13:48.090 --> 00:13:52.870
The paragraphs in Mali's book were filled with quiet evenings and white

242
00:13:52.871 --> 00:13:55.380
picket fences, but underneath them are rash,

243
00:13:55.400 --> 00:13:57.940
hidden by ciphers and invisible link.

244
00:13:58.340 --> 00:14:03.220
A different story unfolded Norwood was incredibly adept at stealing acquiring or

245
00:14:03.221 --> 00:14:05.260
copying sensitive scientific material.

246
00:14:05.440 --> 00:14:08.740
And getting that information into the hands of GRU agents.

247
00:14:09.000 --> 00:14:13.140
She always maintained a low profile limiting her deliveries to just four or five

248
00:14:13.180 --> 00:14:13.900
a year.

249
00:14:13.900 --> 00:14:17.570
Normally these took place in the suburb of Southeast London via the usual

250
00:14:17.600 --> 00:14:22.370
methods favored by Soviet spycraft, the dead drop or the swipe. Once again,

251
00:14:22.890 --> 00:14:25.610
MI five got close to arresting her in 1965.

252
00:14:25.611 --> 00:14:28.930
The security service had concluded that Malita had been spying for the Soviet

253
00:14:28.980 --> 00:14:30.290
since the 1930s,

254
00:14:30.470 --> 00:14:34.410
but she was neither detained nor interviewed intelligence officers wanted to

255
00:14:34.411 --> 00:14:38.000
hide how much they knew about her activity D to protect other investigations,

256
00:14:38.210 --> 00:14:39.400
which is understandable,

257
00:14:39.460 --> 00:14:43.320
but it is surprising how she was still allowed to continue handing secrets over

258
00:14:43.340 --> 00:14:45.360
to these Soviets. Shortly afterwards,

259
00:14:45.960 --> 00:14:48.560
milita had even graduated from recruited agent a recruiter,

260
00:14:48.561 --> 00:14:52.360
enlisting the services of a civil servant code named hunt agent hunt.

261
00:14:52.640 --> 00:14:56.920
Since agent ho were able to pass extensive scientific and technical intelligence

262
00:14:56.921 --> 00:14:59.360
on British armaments of KGB and GIU.

263
00:14:59.570 --> 00:15:02.880
These additional efforts were adequately rewarded by the Soviets.

264
00:15:03.480 --> 00:15:05.600
Malita was first awarded with the order of the red banner,

265
00:15:05.620 --> 00:15:10.240
by the KGB and offered a monthly salary of the prince sum of 20 pounds

266
00:15:10.610 --> 00:15:13.710
in today's money. That's about $6,060 a year.

267
00:15:13.850 --> 00:15:18.270
So basically $6,000 to risk your freedom reputation and possibly your life

268
00:15:18.271 --> 00:15:21.470
delivering classified information. That's remarkably low,

269
00:15:21.471 --> 00:15:24.790
especially in comparison to other documented Soviet double agents.

270
00:15:24.820 --> 00:15:28.110
Take the example of Robert Hansen, who we've already covered on this channel.

271
00:15:28.510 --> 00:15:32.500
Hansen was an FBI agent who similarly sold secret to the GRU and KGB.

272
00:15:32.680 --> 00:15:35.380
And during his first three years of activity, as a double agent,

273
00:15:35.680 --> 00:15:40.340
he was paid $30,000 a year today's money by the Soviets. That's five of times,

274
00:15:40.360 --> 00:15:44.020
as much as Malita the reality was that Malita was never interested in cash.

275
00:15:44.200 --> 00:15:45.820
She refused the KGB salary.

276
00:15:45.840 --> 00:15:50.300
Double agents are known to act because of mice reasons, money, ideology,

277
00:15:51.180 --> 00:15:51.550
compromise,

278
00:15:51.550 --> 00:15:56.410
and ego Hanson was a money and ego kind of guy while Norwood acted strictly

279
00:15:56.570 --> 00:16:00.770
offer ideology milita was seriously convinced that the communist cause was a

280
00:16:00.771 --> 00:16:04.170
worthy one. And the Soviets were the good guys during the cold war

281
00:16:10.570 --> 00:16:12.600
In 1973 milita turns 61.

282
00:16:12.601 --> 00:16:17.360
And she decided to retire not only from her former employers, the BN FM, R a,

283
00:16:17.580 --> 00:16:19.440
but also from her covert work.

284
00:16:19.620 --> 00:16:24.000
The spy was now a retired granny and later great granny who spent her days

285
00:16:24.001 --> 00:16:26.720
tending to her vegetable garden and baking pies.

286
00:16:27.060 --> 00:16:28.640
As those golden years ticked away.

287
00:16:28.670 --> 00:16:33.470
It's hard to wonder how Mata's faith in the Soviet system have changed as

288
00:16:33.660 --> 00:16:36.870
more and more reports of Eastern block atrocities reach the west.

289
00:16:37.170 --> 00:16:40.950
And later what was going through her head is she saw the members of the Warsaw

290
00:16:41.110 --> 00:16:45.830
packed, collapsing peace by peace in the late 1980s, had it all been worth it.

291
00:16:46.140 --> 00:16:50.270
What would the future be like with only one superpower left in charge and on a

292
00:16:50.271 --> 00:16:54.740
more personal level? Would the be any con for double agents like her,

293
00:16:54.970 --> 00:16:59.780
even if retired or on ice, unbeknownst to milita in November, 1992,

294
00:17:00.020 --> 00:17:01.220
a former Soviet agent,

295
00:17:01.240 --> 00:17:05.420
and archivers that brought thousands of documents to London that he had smuggled

296
00:17:05.421 --> 00:17:08.780
out of KGB headquarters. His name was Vaseline, Mitch,

297
00:17:09.420 --> 00:17:12.820
M I six took charge of the wealth of information in metric's archives.

298
00:17:13.180 --> 00:17:15.490
After deep briefing, most of their Western allies,

299
00:17:15.491 --> 00:17:20.490
they decided to allow its publication in late 1995 Mitchen was introduced to the

300
00:17:20.650 --> 00:17:24.010
official historian of I five. His name was Christopher,

301
00:17:24.011 --> 00:17:27.570
Andrew Mitchen and Andrew worked for years on their volume,

302
00:17:27.750 --> 00:17:28.930
the metric and archive,

303
00:17:28.931 --> 00:17:31.650
which was scheduled for publication in the Autum of 1999,

304
00:17:32.150 --> 00:17:33.850
by then the ripple effect of these.

305
00:17:34.140 --> 00:17:38.720
So secret secrets had already spread across the UK government in December, 1998,

306
00:17:38.721 --> 00:17:43.000
British home secretary Jack straw was informed for the first time about Malta's

307
00:17:43.001 --> 00:17:47.120
role and consulted with the security services and the attorney general on

308
00:17:47.440 --> 00:17:50.400
whether to prosecutor in April, 1999, they reached a decision.

309
00:17:50.900 --> 00:17:54.360
No action would be taken against the former agent ho due to her age,

310
00:17:54.620 --> 00:17:58.240
due to the fact that 26 years had passed since her retirement is a spy.

311
00:17:58.550 --> 00:18:00.280
This does make some sense. However,

312
00:18:00.281 --> 00:18:03.920
it is also possible that straw had considered the consequences of a public

313
00:18:04.010 --> 00:18:04.620
trial,

314
00:18:04.620 --> 00:18:09.590
namely exposing the most embarrassing past failures of MI five milita

315
00:18:09.591 --> 00:18:13.510
Norwood remains blisfully unaware of the debate surrounding her status as a

316
00:18:13.511 --> 00:18:17.070
private citizen in the corridors of power. By September of 1999,

317
00:18:17.071 --> 00:18:19.550
she had developed a friendship with author David Burke,

318
00:18:19.710 --> 00:18:21.590
a Russian literature scholar Burke,

319
00:18:21.591 --> 00:18:25.510
regularly traveled from Le to London to sit down with milita runs interviewer

320
00:18:25.511 --> 00:18:28.910
about her father's work with Lev Toto, the two, usually at Sunday,

321
00:18:29.060 --> 00:18:32.060
a lunch together milita fixing a dish of fish fingers, greens,

322
00:18:32.180 --> 00:18:36.300
a garden and tea served in she ABAR mugs. Apart from the last detail,

323
00:18:36.301 --> 00:18:40.860
sounds very English on the 11th of that. September Burke was on his way to mils.

324
00:18:40.861 --> 00:18:42.420
When he noticed an article in the times,

325
00:18:42.650 --> 00:18:46.580
featuring a preview of the metric and archive the article exposed milita as the

326
00:18:46.720 --> 00:18:50.130
spy who had betrayed British secrets to the Soviets for 40 years,

327
00:18:50.320 --> 00:18:55.290
this was a bombshell and the British press had a blast identifying milita as the

328
00:18:55.291 --> 00:18:57.570
great granny spy or even better.

329
00:18:57.870 --> 00:19:02.370
The spy who came in from the co-op David Burke immediately phoned milita rafter.

330
00:19:02.390 --> 00:19:04.850
She had been exposed and asked if the two could meet anyway,

331
00:19:05.370 --> 00:19:07.130
milita replied you'd better come. Next week,

332
00:19:07.230 --> 00:19:10.360
the world's press has found its way to my doorstep. See,

333
00:19:10.630 --> 00:19:15.200
I've been a rather naughty girl. Indeed milita was being hounded by journalists,

334
00:19:15.201 --> 00:19:17.600
offering lucrative deals for her to tell her story.

335
00:19:17.700 --> 00:19:22.320
But as usual money was no big motivator for her. She even declared to the BBC.

336
00:19:22.520 --> 00:19:24.240
I did what I did not to make money,

337
00:19:24.420 --> 00:19:26.520
but to help prevent the defeat of a new system,

338
00:19:26.521 --> 00:19:29.600
which had a great cost given ordinary people, food,

339
00:19:29.940 --> 00:19:33.750
and which they could afford a good education and a health service.

340
00:19:34.710 --> 00:19:37.790
Milita also explains that her husband, Hillary, who had died in 1986,

341
00:19:37.820 --> 00:19:41.150
knew all about her espionage activities. He disapproved of course,

342
00:19:41.250 --> 00:19:44.470
but he had never tried to stop her on the other hands. There only daughter,

343
00:19:44.560 --> 00:19:48.550
Anita was as surprised as everybody else. When questions about her motives,

344
00:19:49.030 --> 00:19:49.510
milita added.

345
00:19:49.510 --> 00:19:53.580
I thought perhaps what I had to might be useful in helping Russia to keep

346
00:19:53.610 --> 00:19:56.540
abreast of Britain, America and Germany in general,

347
00:19:56.940 --> 00:19:59.300
I do not agree with spying against one's country.

348
00:20:00.060 --> 00:20:03.540
Milita turned down all the offers from the newspapers preferring to tell a story

349
00:20:03.720 --> 00:20:07.660
for free to a friend, David Burke, with a side dish of Phish fingers.

350
00:20:14.270 --> 00:20:15.103
Six years later,

351
00:20:15.370 --> 00:20:17.770
milita Norwood died of cancer and heart disease at Nero hospital,

352
00:20:18.170 --> 00:20:20.530
Wil Hampton on June the second, 2005.

353
00:20:20.870 --> 00:20:24.050
If you want to learn more about this particular SP we can recommend David

354
00:20:24.080 --> 00:20:24.913
Burke's own book,

355
00:20:24.990 --> 00:20:28.490
the spa who came in from the co-op or a fictionalized and rather embellished

356
00:20:28.770 --> 00:20:28.771
account,

357
00:20:28.771 --> 00:20:33.360
you can also check out 2000 and thirteens novel red Joan by Jeanie Rooney

358
00:20:33.390 --> 00:20:37.120
adapted as a film in 2019 with Judy Jen in the lead,

359
00:20:37.220 --> 00:20:41.120
the effectiveness and importance of Ali to Norwood as a spy has been questioned

360
00:20:41.180 --> 00:20:45.600
by some intelligence analysts who argued that Soviet research may have already

361
00:20:45.601 --> 00:20:49.080
been in possession of the so-called secrets that she delivered. However,

362
00:20:49.270 --> 00:20:53.560
Mitch's papers themselves acknowledge that agent ho was held in high esteem by

363
00:20:53.620 --> 00:20:58.560
Moscow so much so that the KGB and G U frequently argued on who should be

364
00:20:58.561 --> 00:20:59.140
handling her.

365
00:20:59.140 --> 00:21:03.440
The KGB even considered her to be of more values than the famous Cambridge five

366
00:21:03.830 --> 00:21:07.150
ring of British double agents, which included am I six operatives,

367
00:21:07.170 --> 00:21:11.150
Kim Philby and guy Burgess diplomat, Donald McLean, artist historian,

368
00:21:11.350 --> 00:21:14.870
an arch curator curator for the Royal family, Anthony blunt and civil servants.

369
00:21:14.871 --> 00:21:15.750
John Karos.

370
00:21:15.880 --> 00:21:20.470
These five are remembered as some of the most dangerous Western traders in

371
00:21:20.471 --> 00:21:23.630
espionage history. And yet, according to the KGB,

372
00:21:24.060 --> 00:21:27.740
they had nothing on mallet Norwood. So really hope you found that video.

373
00:21:28.020 --> 00:21:30.620
Interesting. If you did, please do hit that thumbs up bottom below.

374
00:21:30.770 --> 00:21:34.300
Also go subscribe to business plays, relatively new channel. I'm doing that.

375
00:21:34.301 --> 00:21:35.260
I mentioned at the beginning,
