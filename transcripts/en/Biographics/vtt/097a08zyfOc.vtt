00:01:14.950 --> 00:01:16.050
And now today's video.

24
00:01:22.430 --> 00:01:27.000
<v 0>From 1976 to 1983, Argentina was ruled by a military dictatorship,</v>

25
00:01:27.120 --> 00:01:31.880
a Kuta of the three commanders in chief from the three national branches of the

26
00:01:31.881 --> 00:01:33.840
armed forces during its first years,

27
00:01:33.841 --> 00:01:36.600
the military fought a war against its own people,

28
00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:41.240
a conflict characterized by assassinations, kidnappings and torture.

29
00:01:41.620 --> 00:01:45.150
<v 2>It was a war which not even the most innocent was safe.</v>

30
00:01:45.220 --> 00:01:48.670
This was Argentina's dirty war at the helm of the hun.

31
00:01:48.800 --> 00:01:53.550
Ultimately accountable for his worst crimes was one man somber or

32
00:01:53.870 --> 00:01:57.150
steer enigmatic and conflicted in his motivations,

33
00:01:57.290 --> 00:02:01.550
but ultimately ruthless in his decision making. This was the general,

34
00:02:01.850 --> 00:02:06.580
the president and defacto military dicta of one of the worst regimes in south

35
00:02:06.581 --> 00:02:09.980
America. Jorge Raphael Dela.

36
00:02:16.310 --> 00:02:21.220
<v 0>Jorge Raphael Videla was born on August the second, 1925 in Mercedes Argentina.</v>

37
00:02:21.520 --> 00:02:26.250
His father was Raphael Videla in army. He major, and his mother was AGA Redondo.

38
00:02:26.480 --> 00:02:30.330
They named then born after his older brothers twins, Jorge and Rael,

39
00:02:30.430 --> 00:02:35.210
who had been born in 1922 and died one year later due to a measles outbreak.

40
00:02:35.350 --> 00:02:38.610
The young Vidala spent his formative years in the well to-do middle class,

41
00:02:38.611 --> 00:02:39.610
provincial Milo.

42
00:02:39.670 --> 00:02:44.010
It was a childhood shaped by the Auste military values of his father and the CA

43
00:02:44.320 --> 00:02:48.360
ethnic piety of his affectionate mother. Jorge shared these religious values,

44
00:02:48.361 --> 00:02:52.920
serving with enthusiasm as an alt boy in the Mercedes cathedral in 1942,

45
00:02:52.921 --> 00:02:54.360
before finishing secondary school,

46
00:02:54.410 --> 00:02:58.520
Jorge Raphael expressed his wishes to enlist in the military academy and follow

47
00:02:58.521 --> 00:03:03.040
his father's footsteps. Young Videla was a quiet Auste and morally upright boy.

48
00:03:03.180 --> 00:03:06.880
The life in uniform already appeared to him to be the only way he could live and

49
00:03:07.080 --> 00:03:10.240
interact with the wider world. Despite some objections from his father,

50
00:03:10.370 --> 00:03:13.080
Jorge enlisted in the academy, and in 1944,

51
00:03:13.180 --> 00:03:16.920
he graduated as a second lieutenants in the infantry. In the meantime,

52
00:03:16.921 --> 00:03:21.550
Argentina had experienced one, many military cos in July, 1943,

53
00:03:21.570 --> 00:03:23.830
the group of United officers had seized power.

54
00:03:24.010 --> 00:03:27.950
The military cabinet included an ambitious Colonel Juan Perran in charge of the

55
00:03:28.110 --> 00:03:31.270
ministry of national labor after suffering some setbacks,

56
00:03:31.271 --> 00:03:32.550
including incarceration.

57
00:03:32.950 --> 00:03:35.950
Perran won the presidential elections on June the fourth, 1946,

58
00:03:36.630 --> 00:03:40.500
flying among his charismatic second wife Avita. Yes, the one from the musical.

59
00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:44.860
He gave rise to the movement that took his name. Paramo.

60
00:03:45.340 --> 00:03:47.580
This movement had many intellectual contradictions,

61
00:03:47.581 --> 00:03:50.420
which would later erupt into opposing factions.

62
00:03:50.720 --> 00:03:54.860
It was based on a strong cult of personality surrounding Juan and David Vita,

63
00:03:54.960 --> 00:03:59.020
who appealed to the lower classes by running strong welfare programs.

64
00:03:59.670 --> 00:04:04.450
Policy Perran is cold war era government sought a third position that aligns

65
00:04:04.810 --> 00:04:08.090
underneath the capitalism nor communism yet at the same time,

66
00:04:08.570 --> 00:04:13.370
Perran had a fascination with European fascism offering shelter to many former

67
00:04:13.610 --> 00:04:14.490
Nazi war criminals.

68
00:04:14.970 --> 00:04:18.690
Young officer VII had apparently no interest in political matters at this stage

69
00:04:18.750 --> 00:04:22.400
and was more focused on building his family in 1948.

70
00:04:22.410 --> 00:04:26.400
Viola married Alicia Hartridge daughter of an ambassador who was often

71
00:04:26.401 --> 00:04:29.280
speculated to have been his one and only girlfriends.

72
00:04:29.600 --> 00:04:31.040
The couple would go on to have six children.

73
00:04:31.180 --> 00:04:32.600
Two of whom would join the military.

74
00:04:32.601 --> 00:04:36.640
Another son Alejandro suffered from Oli free, near a severe learning disability.

75
00:04:36.790 --> 00:04:39.920
Alejandro was ultimately educated by two French nuns,

76
00:04:40.400 --> 00:04:42.910
Rene and Alice Moine.

77
00:04:43.170 --> 00:04:46.870
The sisters took good care of the boy helping his development and teaching him

78
00:04:46.871 --> 00:04:48.510
how to read in 1957.

79
00:04:48.511 --> 00:04:52.590
President Huper on had been ousted by yet another co and was living in exile

80
00:04:52.591 --> 00:04:56.230
with his third wife, Maria Ella Martinez, better known as Isabel.

81
00:04:56.670 --> 00:04:58.310
Ella was rising in his military career.

82
00:04:58.490 --> 00:05:00.790
He detains the rank of major and worked in Washington.

83
00:05:01.340 --> 00:05:04.900
DC is a delegate to the Inter-American defense board or IDB.

84
00:05:05.090 --> 00:05:09.420
This institution was designed to coordinate the militaries of the Americas in an

85
00:05:09.421 --> 00:05:12.380
anti communist function over the next 10 years. The quiet,

86
00:05:12.660 --> 00:05:14.980
but rigorous officer went from strength to strength.

87
00:05:15.080 --> 00:05:18.460
He secured a senior post at the department of defense directed the military

88
00:05:18.461 --> 00:05:23.290
academy and return to Washington to define the mental strategy of the IDB,

89
00:05:23.430 --> 00:05:27.250
but a relatively quiet and productive decade would soon clash with the chaos

90
00:05:27.251 --> 00:05:29.650
brought about by the 1970s

91
00:05:36.030 --> 00:05:36.970
In 1971,

92
00:05:37.210 --> 00:05:41.610
J became general vial appointed by Argentina's military dictator,

93
00:05:41.890 --> 00:05:45.080
a Alejandro LA two years later, he was promoted again,

94
00:05:45.081 --> 00:05:48.560
serving as chief of staff at the army that same month by popular demand.

95
00:05:48.920 --> 00:05:52.560
Laus seeded power to a resurgent. Juan Perran with wife,

96
00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:57.240
Isabelle as vice presidents. This term was shortlived on July. The first 1954,

97
00:05:57.241 --> 00:05:59.680
president Juan Dominga Perran died of a heart attack.

98
00:05:59.681 --> 00:06:03.160
Opening another Pandora's box of tumultuous,

99
00:06:03.320 --> 00:06:07.400
a Tinian politics vis the army inherited a nation in chaos.

100
00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:10.480
Here is the situation in simplistic terms.

101
00:06:11.120 --> 00:06:15.280
Power was seized by ISAB Perran supported by her minister of social welfare in

102
00:06:15.440 --> 00:06:17.750
chief advisor missed de Lopez Rega.

103
00:06:17.900 --> 00:06:22.030
This duo had many political opponents including left wing Perus who had

104
00:06:22.031 --> 00:06:24.630
organized the Monera gorilla movement.

105
00:06:24.820 --> 00:06:28.070
They were not the only left leaning armed group in action.

106
00:06:28.160 --> 00:06:32.950
There was also the E R P or people's Republican army Marxist

107
00:06:33.630 --> 00:06:38.460
Gus gorilla group funded by Castro's Cuba during 19 7 4 in 1975.

108
00:06:38.490 --> 00:06:40.660
Both groups carried out spectacular attacks,

109
00:06:40.661 --> 00:06:45.380
often resorting to terrorist methodologies. For example, in October of 1975,

110
00:06:45.580 --> 00:06:49.900
Monteiro commander hijacked a plane and flew to for moer on the border with

111
00:06:50.020 --> 00:06:54.060
Paraguay taking dozens of hostages, they then assaulted an American barracks,

112
00:06:54.061 --> 00:06:56.020
killing 12 soldiers and looting the armory.

113
00:06:56.080 --> 00:06:59.810
The commander rushed back to the Hyrax Blain and flew to safety in Santa Fe,

114
00:06:59.811 --> 00:07:01.570
700 kilometers south of OSA.

115
00:07:02.070 --> 00:07:06.450
The ER P from their side conducted a bit of gorilla warfare in the Tuka command

116
00:07:06.730 --> 00:07:10.250
province in Northern Argentina while conducting several assassinations in

117
00:07:10.251 --> 00:07:11.490
kidnappings all around the country.

118
00:07:11.710 --> 00:07:15.450
The Mons NES and the ER P were opposed by a third faction,

119
00:07:15.470 --> 00:07:19.080
the triple Argentinian anti communist Alliance.

120
00:07:19.470 --> 00:07:21.360
This was a terrorist group funded,

121
00:07:21.361 --> 00:07:24.200
alarmed by none other than Isabelle Peron's chief advisor,

122
00:07:24.740 --> 00:07:26.400
Mr. Reer admits the chaos.

123
00:07:26.700 --> 00:07:29.640
The military tried to maintain order fighting everything.

124
00:07:29.700 --> 00:07:33.960
And everybody Videla in particular was worried about the increasing paramilitary

125
00:07:33.961 --> 00:07:37.120
power of the anti-communist Alliance. So with backing from his board,

126
00:07:37.520 --> 00:07:41.710
its Videla pressured is R Perran into naming him as commander in chief of the

127
00:07:41.711 --> 00:07:42.790
army. In this role,

128
00:07:43.150 --> 00:07:46.390
Videla reorganized the high echelons of the armed forces eliminating all

129
00:07:46.391 --> 00:07:51.230
officers deemed too friendly to parm Vi's heavy handed tactics and du command

130
00:07:51.231 --> 00:07:54.710
virtually eliminated the ER P's profile in the ongoing conflict,

131
00:07:54.770 --> 00:07:58.950
but other factions still remains powerful. Moreover, the R Argentinian economy,

132
00:07:59.260 --> 00:08:04.140
he was in shambles as Isabelle Peron's government failed to curb a 300%

133
00:08:04.320 --> 00:08:05.900
per year inflation rate.

134
00:08:06.010 --> 00:08:10.340
Many high ranking officers began conspiring against the president and VE was one

135
00:08:10.341 --> 00:08:11.174
of them.

136
00:08:17.180 --> 00:08:21.130
Vid believed that support for president Perran was strong enough to grant a new

137
00:08:21.290 --> 00:08:25.410
election in late 1975. He openly admitted to his contacts in Washington,

138
00:08:25.480 --> 00:08:28.330
that he was preparing plans for a military takeover of the government,

139
00:08:28.470 --> 00:08:32.730
but a CIA report identified him as the voice of patients curing his subordinates

140
00:08:32.731 --> 00:08:35.570
enthusiasm, who thirsted for a co immediately.

141
00:08:35.571 --> 00:08:40.400
Finally VI Ella led a bloodless co in the night between the 23rd and the 24th of

142
00:08:40.400 --> 00:08:43.080
March in 1976. A military hunter took power,

143
00:08:43.081 --> 00:08:45.680
which held on for seven years until 1983.

144
00:08:46.080 --> 00:08:50.000
The hunter included medal is the new president and representative of the army

145
00:08:50.030 --> 00:08:54.880
general Ramona Gasti represented the air force and Admiral Eduard Maira

146
00:08:55.180 --> 00:08:59.800
the Navy in his official address to the nation president Videla declared the

147
00:09:00.040 --> 00:09:00.550
armed forces,

148
00:09:00.550 --> 00:09:04.240
realizing that the current state of affairs could not offer an acceptable future

149
00:09:04.300 --> 00:09:08.600
for the country have produced the only possible answer to this crucial situation

150
00:09:08.900 --> 00:09:12.320
as the defacto dictator of Argentina of Videla quickly dissolved Congress,

151
00:09:12.390 --> 00:09:16.230
handing over legislative functions to a nine member commission,

152
00:09:16.290 --> 00:09:19.030
he then forbade all democratic political activities,

153
00:09:19.031 --> 00:09:21.950
suspending civilian courts and banning political parties.

154
00:09:22.250 --> 00:09:24.870
He also put a stop on all trade union activity,

155
00:09:24.871 --> 00:09:29.430
putting the general Confederation of labor under strict military control

156
00:09:30.190 --> 00:09:34.590
Videla and friends exercised tight censorship on any media or cultural product,

157
00:09:34.591 --> 00:09:39.260
which did not sit well with the ultranationalist and ultra conservative

158
00:09:39.261 --> 00:09:40.420
agenda. For instance,

159
00:09:40.520 --> 00:09:44.820
the sky of Wey Aries became darked by the smoke of burning books.

160
00:09:45.620 --> 00:09:49.700
Buner called the set of measures, a process of national reorganization.

161
00:09:50.250 --> 00:09:54.700
Some sectors of AIAN society welcomes the co as an antidote to the rampant,

162
00:09:54.701 --> 00:09:58.770
chaos and economic instability that had marked the last prime administration.

163
00:09:59.150 --> 00:10:03.690
But it was no secret that the re respect of human rights was nobody's priority.

164
00:10:04.350 --> 00:10:08.450
CIA reports from this period also raised some concerns while still acknowledging

165
00:10:08.610 --> 00:10:12.290
the net of the Hunter's Triver of Videla was the most levelheaded one U

166
00:10:12.291 --> 00:10:16.360
intelligence described him as a professional soldier of unquestioned integrity,

167
00:10:16.840 --> 00:10:19.840
a strict moralist of the old school at about Roman Catholic,

168
00:10:20.100 --> 00:10:24.600
his hatred of corruption and his religious devotion legendary in Argentina,

169
00:10:25.000 --> 00:10:26.920
a CIA brief of April, 1976,

170
00:10:26.921 --> 00:10:30.320
highlighted a rift within the military government on one corner that was

171
00:10:30.321 --> 00:10:34.840
president Ello and his confidant army chief of staff general by on the opposite

172
00:10:34.841 --> 00:10:39.190
corner was air force general a go and admir in general,

173
00:10:39.320 --> 00:10:43.350
these hard liners were trying to force general Ella to take a tougher stand on

174
00:10:43.510 --> 00:10:47.550
the subversion of leftist gorillas and their sympathizers who were still quite

175
00:10:47.551 --> 00:10:51.350
active. More than 70 policemen had been killed by the ER P or the Monte Nero.

176
00:10:51.351 --> 00:10:54.230
Since the takeover, the response of the hunter was brutal.

177
00:10:54.670 --> 00:10:57.860
The hundreds of gorilla fighters were killed or arrested even when the threat

178
00:10:57.861 --> 00:11:01.420
was almost eradicated, the ever present security forces were still abducting,

179
00:11:01.421 --> 00:11:04.220
alleged dissidents for questioning or worse.

180
00:11:05.020 --> 00:11:07.020
Messa and agai were also concerned.

181
00:11:07.140 --> 00:11:10.220
The Videla was seeking a reconciliation with theist faction,

182
00:11:10.221 --> 00:11:11.860
which was somewhat true.

183
00:11:11.890 --> 00:11:16.100
Some of Videla subordinates were in fact coordinating with Peronist labor and

184
00:11:16.101 --> 00:11:17.890
political leaders to build a common base,

185
00:11:18.250 --> 00:11:19.690
popular support for the new government,

186
00:11:19.910 --> 00:11:24.570
rather than ousting Videla mess Sarah and the hard liners focused instead on

187
00:11:24.571 --> 00:11:26.410
removing his moderate advisors,

188
00:11:26.411 --> 00:11:30.770
president Videla while apparently not 100% agreeing with brutal repression

189
00:11:30.860 --> 00:11:33.730
eventually endorsed it in order to stay in power.

190
00:11:33.731 --> 00:11:36.330
And to keep one hand on the wheel in the following years,

191
00:11:36.430 --> 00:11:40.360
anyone suspected of leftist, pist sympathies, as well as factory workers,

192
00:11:40.410 --> 00:11:44.280
trade union students, professors, intellectuals, journalists, entrepreneurs,

193
00:11:44.281 --> 00:11:46.160
social workers, even members of the clergy.

194
00:11:46.710 --> 00:11:49.760
Everybody could fall how of the country's new death squads.

195
00:11:50.140 --> 00:11:52.440
And this was the start of the dirty war.

196
00:11:58.650 --> 00:12:01.320
Death squads began traveling the streets at night.

197
00:12:01.430 --> 00:12:03.320
They were composed of young soldiers,

198
00:12:03.720 --> 00:12:06.000
airmen or sailors dressed in jeans and leather jackets.

199
00:12:06.110 --> 00:12:09.920
Nick keister of the BBC recalls how one of the death squads in invaded his

200
00:12:09.921 --> 00:12:14.070
sister-in-law's family home at 2:00 AM in-law was only 20 at the time.

201
00:12:14.250 --> 00:12:18.030
And her gorilla actions consisted of talking politics at Sunday, lunch,

202
00:12:18.310 --> 00:12:20.150
distributing pamphlets and writing graffiti.

203
00:12:20.380 --> 00:12:24.670
Once she in her terrorist cell had attacked a nurse in the street resulting in

204
00:12:24.671 --> 00:12:28.950
no injury in Custer's retelling the death squad could not find this dangerous

205
00:12:28.960 --> 00:12:31.550
rebel, unbeknownst to them. She had already left the country.

206
00:12:31.730 --> 00:12:34.580
The captain of the squad did not hide what would be her destiny.

207
00:12:35.260 --> 00:12:36.940
I can see you are nice people, Madam,

208
00:12:37.120 --> 00:12:41.820
but we know your daughter is in with the gorilla. If we find her, you know,

209
00:12:41.821 --> 00:12:42.700
what is going to happen,

210
00:12:43.120 --> 00:12:47.820
and most people did know dissenters were abducted and imprisoned without

211
00:12:47.821 --> 00:12:52.020
trial and incarcerated in one of 520 detention and torture centers throughout

212
00:12:52.021 --> 00:12:55.250
Argentina, the most informa ones were the ESMA,

213
00:12:55.390 --> 00:12:59.410
the school of mechanical engineering of the Navy and prison.

214
00:12:59.710 --> 00:13:03.410
The majority of those who walked through those gates never returned.

215
00:13:03.480 --> 00:13:05.010
They simply disappeared.

216
00:13:05.230 --> 00:13:08.970
That's how Argentinians used to call them lost Des Paris CDOs,

217
00:13:09.150 --> 00:13:13.010
the mothers of the disappeared to began staging silent protests in the central

218
00:13:13.140 --> 00:13:14.960
Plaza, Dem Aries.

219
00:13:15.150 --> 00:13:20.000
They were the Marre di Plaza am Mayo later to be joined by the ABUS or the

220
00:13:20.001 --> 00:13:23.440
grandmothers. Their activism demanded answers from the government,

221
00:13:23.441 --> 00:13:26.800
focusing on the truth surrounding the fate of their children. In most cases,

222
00:13:26.980 --> 00:13:31.200
it was a truth to ruthless to imagine the suspected enemies of the state were

223
00:13:31.201 --> 00:13:33.600
subjected to atrocious torches, regardless of their age,

224
00:13:33.601 --> 00:13:37.670
gender common technique was to tie prisoners to a metal structure,

225
00:13:37.700 --> 00:13:40.710
such as a bed frame and run a strong electric current through their bodies.

226
00:13:41.010 --> 00:13:44.070
If jailers felt particularly sadistic, they connected the electrodes,

227
00:13:44.230 --> 00:13:45.470
the victim's genital and,

228
00:13:45.950 --> 00:13:49.390
and laughed how the victim jumped up and down on the bed frame shaken by

229
00:13:49.430 --> 00:13:52.110
uncontrolled spasms of pain. In many cases,

230
00:13:52.210 --> 00:13:54.910
the electric shocks were administered by a cattle product.

231
00:13:55.660 --> 00:13:59.860
Yuko Bowman renowned editor of the newspaper lap in Yong was tortured in such a

232
00:13:59.861 --> 00:14:04.100
way. Luckily he survived. He later revealed how during his captivity,

233
00:14:04.240 --> 00:14:07.260
one of the torturers that clarified their ideology to him,

234
00:14:07.490 --> 00:14:09.180
Argentina has three main enemies.

235
00:14:09.620 --> 00:14:12.940
Karl marks because he tried to destroy the Christian concept of society,

236
00:14:13.500 --> 00:14:14.101
Sigman Freud,

237
00:14:14.101 --> 00:14:18.970
because he tried to the Christian concept of the family and Albert Einstein,

238
00:14:18.971 --> 00:14:22.530
because he tried to destroy the Christian concept of time and space

239
00:14:28.990 --> 00:14:31.610
For all their declared love of Christian values.

240
00:14:31.790 --> 00:14:33.410
The military hunters earned its minions,

241
00:14:33.411 --> 00:14:38.360
showed little respect for members of the clergy for on may the 23rd, 1976,

242
00:14:38.400 --> 00:14:42.960
a military squad arrested two priests, Orlando, Oreo, and Francisco, Alex.

243
00:14:43.230 --> 00:14:46.840
They were tortured for months and eventually freed during their detention.

244
00:14:46.930 --> 00:14:48.160
Their provincial superior,

245
00:14:48.360 --> 00:14:52.960
a 41 year old Jesuit pleaded with general Videla and admir Massira for their

246
00:14:52.961 --> 00:14:56.320
freedom receiving only empty promises in return after their release.

247
00:14:56.380 --> 00:15:00.080
The Jesuit made sure that the two priests left the country and offered shelter

248
00:15:00.140 --> 00:15:03.440
to other clergymen and lay people persecuted by the regime. Well,

249
00:15:03.441 --> 00:15:07.720
that Jesuit's name was Jorge Burgle. Now known as Pope Francis.

250
00:15:08.080 --> 00:15:11.910
The first other priests were not as lucky is fathers Yao.

251
00:15:11.970 --> 00:15:14.470
And ya on July the 18th, 1976,

252
00:15:14.471 --> 00:15:17.750
the regime kidnapped and merged in a different pair of young priests who had

253
00:15:17.751 --> 00:15:19.790
spoken out against the hunter. Four days later,

254
00:15:19.791 --> 00:15:22.910
Bishop on Angela denounced the killers in a homily.

255
00:15:22.930 --> 00:15:26.510
He invited good Christians to forgive them, but to seek the truth. Nonetheless,

256
00:15:26.770 --> 00:15:27.490
on the 4th of August,

257
00:15:27.490 --> 00:15:31.340
Bishop and Lee died in a very suspicious car crash decades later,

258
00:15:31.341 --> 00:15:34.780
it was revealed to be an assassination more than one year later on December the

259
00:15:34.781 --> 00:15:35.780
eighth, 1977,

260
00:15:35.781 --> 00:15:39.860
the death squads abducted two nuns who worked in the deprived areas of Buenos

261
00:15:40.180 --> 00:15:42.940
areas. They were taken to SMA beaten, tortured,

262
00:15:43.200 --> 00:15:46.340
and photographed with a flag of the Monte neuro insurgents.

263
00:15:46.530 --> 00:15:49.900
This was to provide some sort of justification for their incarceration.

264
00:15:50.110 --> 00:15:53.970
Their real crime had been to help up the Madre to Plaza de Mayo for the quest

265
00:15:53.990 --> 00:15:58.490
for answers. Those two nuns were not even AIAN nationals. They were French.

266
00:15:59.250 --> 00:16:02.810
Their names were Rene Le Dre and Alice de more.

267
00:16:02.910 --> 00:16:06.130
The very same women who had looked after president Ella's son,

268
00:16:06.230 --> 00:16:07.210
not so many years earlier,

269
00:16:07.320 --> 00:16:12.280
according to biographers Maria C and been sending ALA over Videla was to

270
00:16:12.440 --> 00:16:14.920
where that the two sisters were in the grasp of the tortures.

271
00:16:15.120 --> 00:16:17.960
And what did he do? Nothing. Sister,

272
00:16:18.560 --> 00:16:21.120
Renee and sister Alice suffered the same faces.

273
00:16:21.520 --> 00:16:23.040
Thousands of other enemies of the hunter.

274
00:16:23.410 --> 00:16:26.720
Every brutal regime has its own methods of mass murder, gas,

275
00:16:27.160 --> 00:16:30.000
forced labor firearms, or even just clubs and machetes.

276
00:16:30.260 --> 00:16:34.230
In the case of the Argentinian hunter, it was by gravity. Fidel's minions,

277
00:16:34.231 --> 00:16:36.630
loaded special cargo flights. With hundreds of passengers,

278
00:16:37.030 --> 00:16:40.590
they'd been stripped naked bound, hooded and sedated with penit.

279
00:16:40.930 --> 00:16:44.430
The planes took off flying over the Ry of the Rio de LA platter,

280
00:16:44.431 --> 00:16:46.430
where the river meets the Atlantic ocean.

281
00:16:46.740 --> 00:16:49.950
Then the plane doors opened and the prisoners were dropped from a height of

282
00:16:49.951 --> 00:16:54.620
hundreds of feet. These were the of Wellers Del the flights of death.

283
00:16:55.130 --> 00:16:57.100
Some of the victims may have died immediately.

284
00:16:57.101 --> 00:17:00.620
Others may have survived the initial impact with their bones shattered only to

285
00:17:00.621 --> 00:17:02.940
drown immediately. Afterwards decades later,

286
00:17:03.000 --> 00:17:06.460
the regime admitted to killing between 7,000 and 9,000 dissidents,

287
00:17:06.480 --> 00:17:10.140
but the mares and other humanitarian sources claim that the number is really

288
00:17:10.141 --> 00:17:14.770
between 12,000 and 30,000 and the dirty war was responsible for another type of

289
00:17:14.771 --> 00:17:17.250
victim between 1976 and 1983,

290
00:17:17.251 --> 00:17:21.730
the Argentinian military kidnapped between 400 and 500 babies born in captivity

291
00:17:22.030 --> 00:17:24.850
to incarcerated dissidents, according to British journalist,

292
00:17:24.851 --> 00:17:25.690
Christopher Hitchen.

293
00:17:25.690 --> 00:17:29.450
Some of those children may have been born after their mother had been raped by

294
00:17:29.451 --> 00:17:30.020
the wardens.

295
00:17:30.020 --> 00:17:33.490
These babies were then given couples with ties to the military as adopted

296
00:17:33.770 --> 00:17:34.080
children.

297
00:17:34.080 --> 00:17:38.120
Most of them grew up without knowing their real origins who their parents were

298
00:17:38.180 --> 00:17:40.880
and whether or not they were still alive decades later,

299
00:17:40.990 --> 00:17:44.000
only 109 of these children were able to trace their origins.

300
00:17:50.300 --> 00:17:53.040
In addition to pointing internal threats, real imagined,

301
00:17:53.400 --> 00:17:56.320
Videla had to deal with a collapsing economy and rampant inflation.

302
00:17:56.540 --> 00:18:00.080
His government was ill suited to economic matters and they made things worse.

303
00:18:00.800 --> 00:18:02.160
Videla and his minister of the economy,

304
00:18:02.480 --> 00:18:06.280
ho Jose Martinez DHAs favorite foreign investment from private corporations

305
00:18:06.281 --> 00:18:08.870
while incentivizing foreign trade. As a result,

306
00:18:08.871 --> 00:18:12.390
local industrial output and infrastructure greatly declined at the same time,

307
00:18:12.630 --> 00:18:16.670
the inflation skyrocketed and so did foreign debt in matters of foreign policy.

308
00:18:17.030 --> 00:18:20.350
Videla sought to cement relationships with other right wing regimes in south

309
00:18:20.351 --> 00:18:23.390
America. Back in March of 1976, when the hunter had taken power,

310
00:18:23.391 --> 00:18:27.310
the CIA first heard reports of operation condo. This was, uh,

311
00:18:27.311 --> 00:18:30.740
cooperative efforts by the intelligence and security services of several Latin

312
00:18:31.020 --> 00:18:34.940
American countries to combat terrorism and subversion participant states

313
00:18:34.941 --> 00:18:39.660
included Argentina, Bolivia, Brazil, Chile, Ecuador, Paraguay, Peru, and UA.

314
00:18:39.690 --> 00:18:43.620
This plan became formalized only in may of night, 56, 2 months later,

315
00:18:43.640 --> 00:18:45.900
the member states had agreed to take executive actions,

316
00:18:46.090 --> 00:18:50.210
even outside their respective borders to strike at terrorist dissident leaders,

317
00:18:50.290 --> 00:18:51.170
residing abroad,

318
00:18:51.200 --> 00:18:55.930
according to a declassified 1976 FBI report condo included a secret

319
00:18:55.931 --> 00:18:57.530
program called phase three,

320
00:18:57.630 --> 00:19:01.770
the formation of special teams of assassins with a mandate to murder subversive

321
00:19:01.771 --> 00:19:02.770
enemies, anywhere in the world.

322
00:19:03.020 --> 00:19:05.730
While the CIA did not take part in the formation of condo,

323
00:19:05.840 --> 00:19:09.730
they were fully aware of it and even provided some assistance. For example,

324
00:19:10.320 --> 00:19:13.640
helped set up computerized links among the intelligence units of the condo

325
00:19:13.660 --> 00:19:14.493
member states.

326
00:19:14.670 --> 00:19:19.040
There's also evidence that security personnel of the us embassy in bueno airs

327
00:19:19.041 --> 00:19:23.600
cooperated with Argentinian secret services in at least one condo operation

328
00:19:23.770 --> 00:19:26.760
theor arrest of Chile dissidents, Jorge Isaac wanes,

329
00:19:27.140 --> 00:19:31.990
the Argentinian and Chile regimes surely cooperated counterinsurgency matters,

330
00:19:32.090 --> 00:19:34.950
but their relationship soured in November, 1978.

331
00:19:35.060 --> 00:19:39.430
This is when border disputes threatened to escalate into full scale war Jorge

332
00:19:40.270 --> 00:19:44.270
Raphaella versus Chile dictator Augusto pinache that would've been an

333
00:19:44.510 --> 00:19:47.990
interesting match. The dispute was about ownership of three islands.

334
00:19:48.060 --> 00:19:52.740
Pickton Lennox and wave located in the or channel of ti Wago.

335
00:19:52.741 --> 00:19:57.500
Whichever country controlled them could extend their exclusive economic zone 200

336
00:19:57.501 --> 00:19:58.780
miles into the south Atlantic,

337
00:19:58.781 --> 00:20:02.780
according to international maritime law negotiation stalled in both countries

338
00:20:02.810 --> 00:20:06.420
mobilized for full on war, which was avoided at the last minute,

339
00:20:06.560 --> 00:20:10.900
thanks to the intervention of the Vatican recently elected Pope jumble, thei,

340
00:20:11.220 --> 00:20:15.690
and I Cardinal Samora, who landed in Buer is on Christmas day.

341
00:20:15.750 --> 00:20:19.570
The first Naval squadrons were just about to engage in combat in the beagle

342
00:20:19.571 --> 00:20:20.030
channel.

343
00:20:20.030 --> 00:20:24.210
The negotiations dragged on for seven years before chili and Argentina finally

344
00:20:24.280 --> 00:20:27.890
made peace. But for the moments an opened conflict, been averted,

345
00:20:28.490 --> 00:20:30.650
Messi and de Augusti rumbled in the backgrounds.

346
00:20:30.800 --> 00:20:34.160
They believed that Ella stands against chili had been too moderate.

347
00:20:34.430 --> 00:20:38.440
They were also displeased with the osteo economic policies imposed by Vi's

348
00:20:38.441 --> 00:20:40.640
economy minister, which were badly needed,

349
00:20:40.940 --> 00:20:45.680
but they were ultimately too little too late. According to the CIA report,

350
00:20:45.681 --> 00:20:49.960
the military was again conspiring against Ella in may of 1980 in 1981,

351
00:20:49.961 --> 00:20:54.280
maybe sensing a counter co Videla agreed to hand over power to his deputy and

352
00:20:54.281 --> 00:20:59.120
confidants general. Roberta Viola VO was succeeded by vice Admiral ACOs,

353
00:20:59.350 --> 00:21:02.600
then general the upholder gout air, the newcomer,

354
00:21:02.601 --> 00:21:06.440
willing to rally internal descent against an external foe put into action of

355
00:21:06.580 --> 00:21:09.750
plan that had been conceived earlier by the Videla administration.

356
00:21:09.970 --> 00:21:11.990
The invasion of the S islands,

357
00:21:12.370 --> 00:21:15.830
the defeat at the hands of the UK in June of 1982,

358
00:21:16.310 --> 00:21:20.310
precipitated the fall of GDI area into the eventual end of the regime.

359
00:21:20.490 --> 00:21:23.390
By 1983, democracy had been restored to Argentina,

360
00:21:29.760 --> 00:21:34.020
New president RA Hanson ensured that Videla and the hunter were tried for their

361
00:21:34.021 --> 00:21:35.420
crimes. More precisely.

362
00:21:35.421 --> 00:21:39.820
The allegations were for a total of 504 kidnapping acts of torture, robbery,

363
00:21:39.821 --> 00:21:43.260
slave labor, and the abduction of babies. In December of 1985,

364
00:21:43.320 --> 00:21:47.730
the once all powerful ex generaler Videla received a life sentence to be served

365
00:21:47.731 --> 00:21:48.570
at a military prison.

366
00:21:48.640 --> 00:21:52.970
This was a life sentence that turned out to only last five years in 1990 Videla

367
00:21:52.971 --> 00:21:55.490
was freed on orders of president Karl manna,

368
00:21:55.491 --> 00:21:59.050
who had granted general amnesty on the basis of a controversial law known as

369
00:21:59.220 --> 00:22:00.970
final points or full stop.

370
00:22:01.610 --> 00:22:04.330
Jorge Rae ELA kept a low profile for the ensuing years,

371
00:22:04.430 --> 00:22:06.970
but few were happy with his new frown freedom.

372
00:22:07.310 --> 00:22:10.640
One of those is Spanish judge za Garza.

373
00:22:10.860 --> 00:22:15.520
He reasons the state terrorism crimes had no statute of limitations and the

374
00:22:15.521 --> 00:22:18.960
prosecution of crimes against humanity had universal jurisdiction.

375
00:22:19.100 --> 00:22:23.160
He started investigating Videla, but Argentina would not extradite him.

376
00:22:23.161 --> 00:22:24.760
Thanks to his pressure though.

377
00:22:24.761 --> 00:22:29.390
Another investigation against the former dictator had gun from J to October of

378
00:22:29.590 --> 00:22:33.910
1998, viz was tried for a crime, which had been previously overlooked one,

379
00:22:33.960 --> 00:22:36.950
which did not benefit from the earlier political amnesty.

380
00:22:37.330 --> 00:22:38.350
The kidnapping of babies,

381
00:22:38.730 --> 00:22:41.590
the decision was carried out by federal judge Markovich.

382
00:22:41.591 --> 00:22:45.790
Following allegations brought together by the ABUS Plaza de Mayo,

383
00:22:46.010 --> 00:22:50.140
the grandmothers of Plaza Mayo Videla did not only that there was a systematic

384
00:22:50.170 --> 00:22:52.980
plan to kidnap babies and give them up for adoption.

385
00:22:53.090 --> 00:22:56.700
What he commented about the babies and their mothers was only that the mothers

386
00:22:56.730 --> 00:22:59.220
were active militants within the terrorist machine.

387
00:22:59.240 --> 00:23:04.140
And many of them used their fetus as human shields while being combatants.

388
00:23:04.280 --> 00:23:07.460
The retired general was found guilty, but only spent one month in jail.

389
00:23:07.560 --> 00:23:09.020
At this point, he was in his seventies.

390
00:23:09.280 --> 00:23:13.130
So it was granted home imprisonment Videla was involved in yet another legal

391
00:23:13.131 --> 00:23:15.570
proceeding in April of 2001. In this case,

392
00:23:15.620 --> 00:23:19.850
judge can Keber Caral founds that operation condo was a criminal organization.

393
00:23:19.851 --> 00:23:23.490
So he subpoenaed Videla to be tried as a member of a criminal organization,

394
00:23:23.590 --> 00:23:27.090
but the crafty Videla was able to delay his appearance for two years,

395
00:23:27.320 --> 00:23:31.240
utilizing technicality after technicality. Then in 2003,

396
00:23:31.680 --> 00:23:33.360
another co happens not Secar,

397
00:23:33.380 --> 00:23:38.280
but ADAT arch per president nest Urner campaigns that the previous

398
00:23:38.390 --> 00:23:41.280
amnesty of 1990 should be ruled as unconstitutional.

399
00:23:41.380 --> 00:23:43.800
It took some time for the Supreme court to agree to the decision,

400
00:23:43.900 --> 00:23:47.360
but eventually in 2008 Videla was incarcerated. Again,

401
00:23:47.500 --> 00:23:50.640
he awaited trial for three years at the camper, Dubai military base,

402
00:23:51.120 --> 00:23:54.120
although while protesting his treatment and declaring himself to be a political

403
00:23:54.240 --> 00:23:58.160
prisoner. Finally in February of 2011, the trial began Videla ends.

404
00:23:58.161 --> 00:24:00.960
The other high ranking officials were charged with the abduction of hundreds of

405
00:24:00.961 --> 00:24:04.400
infants in July of 2012, the final verdict was issue.

406
00:24:04.930 --> 00:24:08.590
The tribunal found proved that the abduction of infants was a systematic and

407
00:24:08.591 --> 00:24:13.190
widespread practice to abduct detain and hide children. Under 10 years of age,

408
00:24:13.210 --> 00:24:18.150
within the context of a general plan of an iation Jorge Videla was found guilty

409
00:24:18.390 --> 00:24:20.830
and sentenced to 50 years to be served in a civilian prison.

410
00:24:21.150 --> 00:24:24.030
But the time of trials was still not over for the old death spot. Next,

411
00:24:24.270 --> 00:24:27.140
he was to be judged his participation operation Conor,

412
00:24:27.200 --> 00:24:31.620
but this time he found a way out the courthouse on may the 12th, 2013,

413
00:24:31.640 --> 00:24:36.220
the elderly Videla slipped while taking a shower in the Marco PAs prison on the

414
00:24:36.221 --> 00:24:39.060
16th of 8:25 AM. He was found dead in his cell.

415
00:24:39.120 --> 00:24:42.300
The autopsy found that he had died of an internal hemorrhage caused by the

416
00:24:42.301 --> 00:24:43.134
earlier fall.

417
00:24:43.180 --> 00:24:47.650
JGE AR Videla was the visible face of mil rule during Argentina's dirty war.

418
00:24:47.870 --> 00:24:51.850
But to this day, his motivations remain hard to decipher declassified,

419
00:24:51.990 --> 00:24:52.651
CIA reports,

420
00:24:52.651 --> 00:24:57.530
express concerns over the excesses of the hunter and seemed to place hope on his

421
00:24:57.730 --> 00:24:58.570
stabilizing influence.

422
00:24:58.710 --> 00:25:02.170
He appeared to seek a reconciliation with the Peronist factions,

423
00:25:02.350 --> 00:25:04.250
at least at the start of the regime.

424
00:25:04.350 --> 00:25:07.640
And yet he seemed to endorse and enforced terrorist tactics.

425
00:25:07.740 --> 00:25:11.320
He was a man of faith and maintained a good relationship with the Batan,

426
00:25:11.420 --> 00:25:16.240
but he did not lift a finger to protect priests and nuns detained at the SMA.

427
00:25:16.380 --> 00:25:19.680
During his years under arrest, Videla eventually confessed to his crimes.

428
00:25:19.900 --> 00:25:23.200
He did admit that some actions of the hunter bordered on the horrific,

429
00:25:23.460 --> 00:25:27.550
but he also justified them as acts of war against a gorilla

430
00:25:27.840 --> 00:25:32.670
insurgency and perhaps most significantly he never expressed remorse

431
00:25:33.050 --> 00:25:36.710
for what he did. So I really hope you found that video. Interesting. If you did,
