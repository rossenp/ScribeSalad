6
00:00:13.300 --> 00:00:14.440
got more on them in just a bit.

7
00:00:20.650 --> 00:00:21.990
In February, 1987,

8
00:00:22.090 --> 00:00:25.870
Israel kicked off the greatest war crimes trial in a generation at the century

9
00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:27.350
of it all said, John Dani,

10
00:00:27.670 --> 00:00:32.510
a former citizen of the USSR who'd rated to America after world war II by his

11
00:00:32.511 --> 00:00:33.170
own account.

12
00:00:33.170 --> 00:00:34.710
<v 1>He was a simple peaceful man,</v>

13
00:00:34.790 --> 00:00:39.630
a retired auto worker and a grandfather living quietly in the Cleveland suburbs,

14
00:00:39.770 --> 00:00:42.740
but Israeli American disagreed. According to them,

15
00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:46.620
Damian's unassuming exterior hid a legendary monster,

16
00:00:47.060 --> 00:00:51.500
a former Tring camp guard. So sadistic survivors still had nightmares about him.

17
00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:56.020
Zagar was known as not even the terrible and the quest to find out if Damian was

18
00:00:56.021 --> 00:01:00.260
really him would spark one of the biggest post Newburg Nazi trials in history.

19
00:01:00.370 --> 00:01:01.690
Born in rural Ukraine in,

20
00:01:01.691 --> 00:01:05.050
in 1920 de could maintain until the end of his life that he was a regular

21
00:01:05.051 --> 00:01:08.130
village boy caught up in the horror and extermination war.

22
00:01:08.131 --> 00:01:12.370
Others though would accuse him of some of the most awful crimes ever recorded.

23
00:01:12.590 --> 00:01:16.610
Was this former peasant boy, a man or a monster today.

24
00:01:16.660 --> 00:01:20.010
We're going to take a look at one of Europe's darkest era and ask if it's ever

25
00:01:20.210 --> 00:01:23.560
possible to know what's inside a man's soul.

26
00:01:28.960 --> 00:01:32.120
<v 0>Amid the ever shifting narrative sands of John Damian's life.</v>

27
00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:35.880
There are some hard facts, both as supporters and accusers could agree on.

28
00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:39.120
He'd been born Ivan Duan on the 3rd of April,

29
00:01:39.120 --> 00:01:43.510
1920 and a miserable village in the Ukrainian countryside, a Hamlet physically,

30
00:01:43.511 --> 00:01:47.350
just a hundred kilometers from Kiev, but in reality, it was a lifetime away.

31
00:01:47.410 --> 00:01:50.950
His parents had both been disabled requiring young. I to look after them,

32
00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:54.910
a struggle made harder by Amon having four years of primary education.

33
00:01:55.050 --> 00:01:58.070
The last thing everyone agreed on was that he'd lived through some horrific

34
00:01:58.071 --> 00:01:59.790
times when Ivan was just eight.

35
00:01:59.810 --> 00:02:04.020
The Soviet union had instituted collectivization pro process of bringing

36
00:02:04.021 --> 00:02:08.060
villages onto communal farms under state control. So when famine had broken out,

37
00:02:08.061 --> 00:02:10.740
people were reliance on the party to feed them. And in Ukraine,

38
00:02:10.741 --> 00:02:15.060
the party hadn't just abdicated its responsibilities that used people's hunger

39
00:02:15.560 --> 00:02:16.393
as a weapon.

40
00:02:16.440 --> 00:02:21.060
The ho andmore was the deliberate genocidal starvation of Ukraine's presence

41
00:02:21.210 --> 00:02:25.890
lasting from 90 32 to 90 33 at devastated the countryside killing three

42
00:02:26.190 --> 00:02:31.050
to 4 million people among the places affected was Deon's village,

43
00:02:31.300 --> 00:02:35.170
where people were reduced to eating weeds in an effort to survive. Yet.

44
00:02:35.230 --> 00:02:39.930
The holiday war was just the first disaster to hit this God forsaken region.

45
00:02:40.080 --> 00:02:41.570
When demean York was 17.

46
00:02:41.610 --> 00:02:45.480
Stalin's great purge blew through the village like the dark hurricane amid the

47
00:02:45.481 --> 00:02:48.760
paranoia and annunciations 22 people were executed by now.

48
00:02:48.761 --> 00:02:51.600
The boy was learning that the best way to survive was to keep his head down,

49
00:02:51.820 --> 00:02:55.680
to just do his work as a tractor driver and a mechanic on their collective farm.

50
00:02:55.980 --> 00:02:59.000
And try not to get noticed besides life wasn't all bad.

51
00:02:59.230 --> 00:03:01.480
<v 1>They were the pretty girls like Maria zebra,</v>

52
00:03:01.920 --> 00:03:04.560
Benu who he sometimes gave lifts to ferrying them to the fields,

53
00:03:05.060 --> 00:03:07.320
but then the third great disaster struck.

54
00:03:07.380 --> 00:03:11.960
And even these small pleasures evaporated in 1939,

55
00:03:11.961 --> 00:03:16.720
the USS R and Nazi Germany jointly invaded Poland by 1940 AAN had been called up

56
00:03:16.721 --> 00:03:20.350
to serve. Although his first would be a tragic comic fast.

57
00:03:20.570 --> 00:03:23.990
One of the red Army's rules was that conscripts needed to bring two changes of

58
00:03:23.991 --> 00:03:24.450
underwear.

59
00:03:24.450 --> 00:03:27.390
<v 0>Ivan's family were so poor that he couldn't get a second pair.</v>

60
00:03:27.410 --> 00:03:28.590
So he was sent back to his village.

61
00:03:28.850 --> 00:03:31.830
Not that Moscow would care about these rules for much longer.

62
00:03:32.510 --> 00:03:37.510
Some 1941 saw Hitler pull a classic Dick move by invading as a

63
00:03:37.750 --> 00:03:38.583
while. Soviet allies,

64
00:03:38.600 --> 00:03:42.740
since they were closest to the German war machine Ukraine and Beru Bo the brunt

65
00:03:42.741 --> 00:03:47.020
of the attack. When the Nazis arrived in Deen's village, they killed 120 people,

66
00:03:47.040 --> 00:03:51.820
nearly all the men in this rural outpost among the dead were two of Deen's male

67
00:03:52.060 --> 00:03:53.620
relatives, but not Ivan.

68
00:03:53.760 --> 00:03:56.900
By the time the Germans arrived in yoke was already fighting for the motherland.

69
00:03:56.960 --> 00:04:00.890
The battle of key of that September was a doomed him to save Ukraine's capital

70
00:04:01.040 --> 00:04:05.210
from being surrounded as part of the red army deman fought to defend the city,

71
00:04:05.211 --> 00:04:08.650
taking a bullet in the back on the shore of the denier. Unbelievably,

72
00:04:08.840 --> 00:04:10.170
this made in one of the lucky ones,

73
00:04:10.190 --> 00:04:13.210
nearly everyone who fought at Kiev was captured whisked away.

74
00:04:13.290 --> 00:04:17.970
A hospital though deman was temporarily spared temporarily because in early

75
00:04:18.210 --> 00:04:22.520
1942, this peasant boy found himself lighting again in crime here this time,

76
00:04:22.810 --> 00:04:24.200
there would be no escaping.

77
00:04:24.201 --> 00:04:28.800
The Nazi onslaught de army career came to an end one hot rainy day in the

78
00:04:28.801 --> 00:04:31.880
coastal city of ke that's. The area was overrun.

79
00:04:31.900 --> 00:04:34.960
He was captured alongside 200,000 other red army soldiers.

80
00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:39.080
A moment that marks the point in his story where the narrative stop agreeing for

81
00:04:39.081 --> 00:04:42.670
the rest of the war, two account would exist. One of I, the prisoner,

82
00:04:42.970 --> 00:04:44.150
and one of I,

83
00:04:44.470 --> 00:04:49.230
the Y the mass murderer figuring out which was real would haunt prosecutors

84
00:04:49.330 --> 00:04:51.150
and survivors alike for decades

85
00:04:57.470 --> 00:04:59.670
Ins telling he's been the rest of the war in hell.

86
00:05:00.070 --> 00:05:03.380
Bar Nazis treated British American POWs with a modicum of respect.

87
00:05:03.381 --> 00:05:08.340
Those captured from the red army had life expectancies on par with elderly may

88
00:05:08.700 --> 00:05:12.260
flies. After the 5.7 million Soviet army members taken prisoner by Germany,

89
00:05:12.510 --> 00:05:16.140
3.3 million would per from disease,

90
00:05:16.470 --> 00:05:19.900
starvation execution, or being worked to death.

91
00:05:20.120 --> 00:05:24.970
That's 57% of all Soviet POWs after Jews red army soldiers

92
00:05:24.971 --> 00:05:28.170
were the second largest victim group of the Holocaust in suction Inferno.

93
00:05:28.320 --> 00:05:33.210
It's amazing Damian survived fact that he never forgot as he told

94
00:05:33.370 --> 00:05:37.650
it. He was internal first in a brutal pow camp near Hellman Polands before being

95
00:05:37.651 --> 00:05:41.250
bounced to other camps where he was used to slave labor by some miracle,

96
00:05:41.390 --> 00:05:45.440
he kept on the living until 1945. When an American force finally liberated him,

97
00:05:45.860 --> 00:05:48.360
at least that's one version of what happens.

98
00:05:48.620 --> 00:05:53.520
The story let's say of John de village boy and prisoner of

99
00:05:53.521 --> 00:05:56.040
war who later re immigrated the country that had saved him.

100
00:05:56.180 --> 00:05:58.520
But you already know there was another story.

101
00:05:58.820 --> 00:06:01.360
One written in the blood of thousands.

102
00:06:01.590 --> 00:06:03.880
That story we might call the tale of Ivan.

103
00:06:03.940 --> 00:06:06.760
The dark half de man maybe kept hidden for years,

104
00:06:06.910 --> 00:06:09.800
told decades later in court filings and prosecutors' notes.

105
00:06:10.030 --> 00:06:14.720
This is Ivan's story. Not long after being captured in crimee in 1942, Ivan,

106
00:06:14.840 --> 00:06:18.750
the man of a way to escape the PO camps with a whole load of new territory to

107
00:06:19.070 --> 00:06:22.270
oversee the Nazis were recruiting what they called. Auxiliary police guards.

108
00:06:22.271 --> 00:06:26.910
Volunteers who'd become better known as Tranic men after the camp

109
00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:30.350
where they were trained of the 5,000 plus Tranic men trained,

110
00:06:30.351 --> 00:06:32.110
virtually all were Soviet POWs.

111
00:06:32.111 --> 00:06:36.270
They were also mostly sadists anti-Semites or psychopaths out to save their own

112
00:06:36.320 --> 00:06:39.100
skins, volunteering to become a Tranic men.

113
00:06:39.120 --> 00:06:42.020
Didn't just mean taking on some like duties for extra rations.

114
00:06:42.160 --> 00:06:46.620
It meant actively taking part in the final solution from their training camp.

115
00:06:47.340 --> 00:06:50.980
Nicki men were dispatched to ghettos and extermination camps like Saba Bo,

116
00:06:51.220 --> 00:06:55.340
and bellette sort to help mass murder Jews by even though would be sent to one

117
00:06:55.341 --> 00:06:58.450
of the most notorious of all Tring up after Auschwitz,

118
00:06:58.550 --> 00:07:02.530
no other Nazi camp killed so many Jews as Tring up nearly 900,000 people,

119
00:07:02.531 --> 00:07:04.810
including thousands of Roma died within its walls.

120
00:07:05.240 --> 00:07:09.770
Only 67 inmates are known to have survived and Ivan would have the

121
00:07:09.930 --> 00:07:12.450
distinction of making this hell. So,

122
00:07:13.230 --> 00:07:17.330
so much worse later described as a tall powerfully built Ukrainian in his mid

123
00:07:17.770 --> 00:07:22.000
twenties. The are Ivan of troubling was said to look remarkably like Ivan deman,

124
00:07:22.390 --> 00:07:25.320
like deman. He had a simple, gentle air about him.

125
00:07:25.840 --> 00:07:27.560
Survivors remembered his kind blue eyes,

126
00:07:27.561 --> 00:07:30.920
almost as much as they remembered his sadism as Jewish victims were taken off

127
00:07:30.921 --> 00:07:32.960
the trains and herded naked to the gas chambers.

128
00:07:33.030 --> 00:07:34.840
Ivan would randomly pick out victims,

129
00:07:35.480 --> 00:07:39.550
laughing and joking as he pulled them to one side he'd gouge eyes or drop off

130
00:07:39.551 --> 00:07:42.310
ears or noses with a sword that he carried. Other times,

131
00:07:42.370 --> 00:07:44.550
it beat people to death with a metal bar,

132
00:07:44.730 --> 00:07:48.030
or maybe lash out at the running crowd with a sword.

133
00:07:48.031 --> 00:07:50.270
Seeing if he couldn't slice open a passing belly.

134
00:07:50.420 --> 00:07:53.870
This is just the stuff that we feel comfortable discussing,

135
00:07:54.110 --> 00:07:56.790
although we're not sure comfort is the right word here.

136
00:07:57.030 --> 00:08:00.260
This eyewitness testimony of I been doing far worse things.

137
00:08:00.261 --> 00:08:03.820
Things will leave up to you to research by yourself.

138
00:08:04.360 --> 00:08:05.700
If you want nightmares. Finally,

139
00:08:05.930 --> 00:08:09.540
once dribbling victims had been loaded into the 25 square meter gas chamber,

140
00:08:10.180 --> 00:08:10.941
Ivan with his mechanics,

141
00:08:10.941 --> 00:08:15.020
knowledge of engines would turn on the motor that pumped carbon monoxide inside

142
00:08:15.280 --> 00:08:16.300
at the height of the Holocaust.

143
00:08:16.380 --> 00:08:20.050
He was capable of working so fast that some 3000 could be exterminate to do just

144
00:08:20.051 --> 00:08:23.650
30 minutes. Perhaps it's little surprise that he soon earned his nickname.

145
00:08:24.010 --> 00:08:28.290
One that would become asain on John Damian's fortunes in the decades to come

146
00:08:28.880 --> 00:08:31.650
Ivan, Gros, Russian for Ivan, the terrible.

147
00:08:32.150 --> 00:08:35.330
And just before we get into the rest of today's video,

148
00:08:35.850 --> 00:08:39.930
a quick word from today's wonderful sponsor square space. If think about it,

149
00:08:40.080 --> 00:08:42.560
this really does seem to be the age of creation.

150
00:08:43.160 --> 00:08:47.560
Everyone is out there making a YouTube channel or a blog or a web store,

151
00:08:47.690 --> 00:08:50.760
stuff like that. You've either got a great idea yourself, or, you know,

152
00:08:50.761 --> 00:08:52.120
someone who has one.

153
00:08:52.220 --> 00:08:56.520
And when it's time to move that project from your head onto the screen in front

154
00:08:56.521 --> 00:08:58.920
of you, that Squarespace comes in.

155
00:08:59.130 --> 00:09:02.400

156
00:09:02.401 --> 00:09:05.240
exactly your website should look like. If so,

157
00:09:05.790 --> 00:09:09.280

no technical nonsense to complicate life or make you just need something

160
00:09:15.510 --> 00:09:18.750
functional, something that works with minimal thoughts. That's what I went for.

161
00:09:18.930 --> 00:09:22.550
So you can just focus on the content and not the coat of paints. In that case,

162
00:09:22.551 --> 00:09:26.550

163
00:09:26.551 --> 00:09:29.910
simple, and also for you. And once you're done setting up the website,

And now back to today's video

176
00:10:09.110 --> 00:10:12.290
In total live and Gros is thought to have personally flipped the switch that led

177
00:10:12.291 --> 00:10:15.850
to over 800,000 dying in Trius chambers,

178
00:10:16.150 --> 00:10:19.760
even among the holocausts mass murderers, this would make him one of the worst.

179
00:10:19.940 --> 00:10:20.960
And yet at the end of the war,

180
00:10:21.300 --> 00:10:25.120
nor could say what had happened to him after an inmate uprising in 1943, Ivan,

181
00:10:25.121 --> 00:10:26.480
the terrible vanish from TRIA,

182
00:10:26.620 --> 00:10:29.920
not long after the camp was raised and all remaining records were destroyed.

183
00:10:30.140 --> 00:10:31.040
It was this mystery,

184
00:10:31.150 --> 00:10:36.120
this void at the heart of tri story that would later cause the innocent Toan so

185
00:10:36.121 --> 00:10:37.950
much such or alternatively,

186
00:10:38.010 --> 00:10:41.510
it was this disappearing act that would allowed AAN to escape justice for so

187
00:10:41.511 --> 00:10:42.030
long,

188
00:10:42.030 --> 00:10:46.710
1945 at last saw the two broken threads of his story twing back together

189
00:10:47.110 --> 00:10:48.430
at the end of the war, everyone agrees,

190
00:10:48.450 --> 00:10:51.910
saw the one time Ukrainian peasant living in a displaced person's camp in

191
00:10:51.911 --> 00:10:53.150
Germany like millions of others.

192
00:10:53.510 --> 00:10:56.630
Tom was waiting for the next chapter of his life to begin the one that would

193
00:10:56.631 --> 00:10:59.660
hope fully taken far away from the European carnage.

194
00:10:59.760 --> 00:11:03.900
It would wind up being a hell of a weight in the time it took for Damian's

195
00:11:03.901 --> 00:11:07.380
paperwork to be processed and is visa issued for immigration to the United

196
00:11:07.380 --> 00:11:11.180
States. See netan married Vera Bloche and they had a daughter.

197
00:11:11.320 --> 00:11:14.980
It wasn't until 1952 that the family were given the all clear to move across the

198
00:11:15.140 --> 00:11:17.850
Atlantic, but move they did settling in Cleveland to New York,

199
00:11:17.851 --> 00:11:19.610
took a job as a mechanic for the Ford motor company.

200
00:11:20.090 --> 00:11:22.330
He and ver had two more kids in 1958.

201
00:11:22.430 --> 00:11:26.050
The former Ukrainian became a naturalized us citizen to celebrate his new

202
00:11:26.290 --> 00:11:26.510
identity.

203
00:11:26.510 --> 00:11:30.770
He legally changed his name from Ivan to John while it certainly helped him

204
00:11:30.771 --> 00:11:31.371
integrate it.

205
00:11:31.371 --> 00:11:35.890
Maybe also helped the process of forgetting of leaving behind all of the horrors

206
00:11:36.240 --> 00:11:37.290
that it's seen in Europe.

207
00:11:37.590 --> 00:11:42.240
As John de lived out his own little slice of the American dream and a dream

208
00:11:42.580 --> 00:11:47.200
is perhaps all it really was. He worked hard and went to church on weekends.

209
00:11:47.201 --> 00:11:50.600
He helped mend his neighbors cars or fixed up local kids bikes,

210
00:11:50.760 --> 00:11:52.840
where the family got a garden. He started growing vegetables.

211
00:11:53.100 --> 00:11:54.880
He was especially proud of his zucchinis,

212
00:11:54.881 --> 00:11:57.960
perhaps there's this blisfully dull existence drifted on.

213
00:11:57.961 --> 00:12:01.080
It began to seem like his wartime experiences were fading,

214
00:12:01.320 --> 00:12:04.480
but maybe what happened in Europe had been the dream all along.

215
00:12:04.700 --> 00:12:09.280
And this suburban life right here was the only reality that he had ever known.

216
00:12:09.530 --> 00:12:13.350
Sadly, Forman note. That's not how others felt those who'd survived.

217
00:12:13.351 --> 00:12:18.070
The Holocaust knew how very real that hell had been and they wouldn't rest until

218
00:12:18.071 --> 00:12:19.910
justice was done to the perpetrators.

219
00:12:20.050 --> 00:12:24.190
The first big wonderful was adult Hyman known as the architect at the Holocaust.

220
00:12:24.190 --> 00:12:27.470
Aikman was captured by the Mustad and Argentina in 1960,

221
00:12:27.471 --> 00:12:29.550
and then placed on trial in Israel. The following year,

222
00:12:29.570 --> 00:12:33.460
his execution was a warning to the war criminals still in hiding that Dory

223
00:12:33.461 --> 00:12:36.300
wasn't over that they were now being hunted. Yes,

224
00:12:36.440 --> 00:12:40.820
it was a much less famous case that really showed what man York's future would

225
00:12:40.821 --> 00:12:41.940
hold in 1964,

226
00:12:41.941 --> 00:12:45.740
the New York times revealed that a friendly Queen's housewife was really her

227
00:12:45.980 --> 00:12:47.060
mind. Brown Steiner,

228
00:12:47.240 --> 00:12:51.740
the infamous stomping mayor of my concentration camp known for the sadistic

229
00:12:51.741 --> 00:12:53.420
delight she took in kicking inmates to death.

230
00:12:53.790 --> 00:12:57.170
It was the beginning of a wave of such discoveries as America was forced to

231
00:12:57.171 --> 00:12:59.970
face. The fact that hundreds of Nazis had made it to the United States,

232
00:12:59.971 --> 00:13:02.970
either clandestinely or with active CIA help.

233
00:13:03.030 --> 00:13:05.730
But whilst this was an embarrassment for Washington,

234
00:13:06.310 --> 00:13:09.810
it was party time in Moscow, in the zero sum game of the cold war.

235
00:13:10.130 --> 00:13:13.010
Anything that was bad for the other side was worth encouraging.

236
00:13:13.230 --> 00:13:17.720
And so it was that in 1975, Soviet agents handed a Ukrainian American newspaper,

237
00:13:17.920 --> 00:13:21.400
a list of former Soviet citizens who'd collaborated with the Nazis among the

238
00:13:21.401 --> 00:13:24.960
names was one that was destined to become infamous Ivan deman.

239
00:13:30.340 --> 00:13:32.600
The case against Amman began slowly enough.

240
00:13:33.040 --> 00:13:36.310
At first it was just an immigration naturalization service investigations.

241
00:13:36.480 --> 00:13:40.710
Since Deen appeared to have lied on his paperwork about his Nazi connections,

242
00:13:41.150 --> 00:13:44.230
evidence was soon found the placed to of the soba Bo extermination camp.

243
00:13:44.330 --> 00:13:48.030
One of the tra Nick men who guarded the Jews as they were herded to their

244
00:13:48.031 --> 00:13:50.750
deaths. At this point, the department of justice got involved in the case,

245
00:13:50.780 --> 00:13:54.150
went crazy. When asked to identify collaborators from a set of photos,

246
00:13:54.151 --> 00:13:58.940
Jewish survivor has picked out to man, but they didn't place him at soor. No.

247
00:13:59.090 --> 00:14:01.380
They said that this man had been at tra blinker.

248
00:14:01.400 --> 00:14:04.900
They'd recognize him anywhere since they kept seeing his face in their

249
00:14:04.901 --> 00:14:07.180
nightmares. He was Iman the terrible.

250
00:14:07.320 --> 00:14:10.660
And so it began the long complex legal battle that would consume the rest of

251
00:14:10.980 --> 00:14:11.940
deman York's life. First,

252
00:14:11.941 --> 00:14:15.460
there was the case to strip him of his citizenship initiated in 1977 and only

253
00:14:15.570 --> 00:14:18.810
ending in 1981. When his us passport was finally revoked,

254
00:14:18.811 --> 00:14:22.170
then there was the series of lawsuits aim at deporting him at sending him back

255
00:14:22.470 --> 00:14:26.330
to Soviet Ukraine. But before he could be put on a plane, Israel intervened,

256
00:14:26.350 --> 00:14:28.810
if Timan really was the notorious Ivan gro,

257
00:14:29.080 --> 00:14:32.730
then they wanted to extra item to put him on trial just as they had Aman.

258
00:14:32.950 --> 00:14:37.080
And yet more legal hearings were launched throughout his all under Y never

259
00:14:37.081 --> 00:14:40.160
swerved from his story that had been a prisoner of war,

260
00:14:40.161 --> 00:14:43.560
that he was an innocent simple man. Who'd been mistaken for another.

261
00:14:43.700 --> 00:14:45.880
If he really was guilty, he told his son-in-law.

262
00:14:46.320 --> 00:14:49.200
The easiest thing to do would be to take a bottle of sleeping pills while

263
00:14:49.201 --> 00:14:53.360
everything over to the family, save the family shame and go to sleep forever.

264
00:14:53.760 --> 00:14:57.040
But he chose to keep on fighting. He explained, proved his innocence.

265
00:14:57.420 --> 00:15:00.480
The legal system disagreed in February, 1986.

266
00:15:00.480 --> 00:15:04.680
The Israeli extradition request was granted to MEOC was put on a plane and told

267
00:15:04.681 --> 00:15:08.560
he faced the death penalty of verdict reserved in Israel for war criminals and

268
00:15:08.640 --> 00:15:12.950
genocide perpetrators. The trial opened Jerusalem on February the 16th, 1987,

269
00:15:13.180 --> 00:15:15.990
like the Iman trial before it, the whole thing was televised.

270
00:15:16.090 --> 00:15:20.030
The result was likely some of the most harrowing footage of a broadcast.

271
00:15:20.250 --> 00:15:23.670
We won't go over the survivor testimony here, there accounting of the crimes,

272
00:15:24.190 --> 00:15:26.030
Ivan crony committed in tri blinker,

273
00:15:26.170 --> 00:15:30.790
but we will note the way the witnesses consistently agreed on one important

274
00:15:31.050 --> 00:15:31.440
fact.

275
00:15:31.440 --> 00:15:36.020
The man sat before them was indeed the sadus who tortured and murdered so many

276
00:15:36.560 --> 00:15:37.740
icy. I of it in front of me,

277
00:15:38.120 --> 00:15:42.860
one declared other evidence soon mounted up an ID card from Thero camp

278
00:15:42.920 --> 00:15:45.420
was supplied with the Soviet archives.

279
00:15:45.440 --> 00:15:48.500
One that showed MEAG had been trained to help in the final solution.

280
00:15:48.680 --> 00:15:52.730
It wasn't him de declared the photo was a fake, but experts proved otherwise.

281
00:15:52.800 --> 00:15:54.730
Then there was the two in 1942,

282
00:15:54.790 --> 00:15:58.810
the SS started to touring members with their blood type deman could scars on his

283
00:15:58.811 --> 00:15:59.211
left arm.

284
00:15:59.211 --> 00:16:02.890
Exactly where that tattoo should have been as if it desperately tried to remove

285
00:16:02.891 --> 00:16:03.100
it.

286
00:16:03.100 --> 00:16:07.650
Still the defense under Israeli attorney Jo arm shaft L did its best Thero camp

287
00:16:07.830 --> 00:16:10.050
ID was real. They contended, but it proved him.

288
00:16:10.450 --> 00:16:13.760
Yao could been at the so Bo termination camp, not TripLink.

289
00:16:14.100 --> 00:16:16.920
The plan was to effectively prove deman was a collaborator,

290
00:16:17.500 --> 00:16:20.840
but not I the terrible with just a single charge against him,

291
00:16:20.841 --> 00:16:24.440
physically pressing the switch that flooded the chambers with carbon monoxide

292
00:16:24.441 --> 00:16:24.940
proving.

293
00:16:24.940 --> 00:16:27.880
He was a different camp guard would at least spare him the death penalty.

294
00:16:28.300 --> 00:16:31.720
In the end though, deman forced them to drop the tactic. He was an innocent man.

295
00:16:31.721 --> 00:16:34.630
He kept repeating as if he wanted it on the record.

296
00:16:35.130 --> 00:16:37.430
The trial ended on February the 18th, 1988.

297
00:16:38.030 --> 00:16:40.270
The verdict was guilty on April the 25th.

298
00:16:40.271 --> 00:16:44.070
John Damian was sentenced to death by hanging and what would've been only the

299
00:16:44.310 --> 00:16:47.470
second civil execution, Israel ever carried out the hypothetical.

300
00:16:47.471 --> 00:16:51.550
There would've been because Damian would never feel the news around his neck.

301
00:16:51.551 --> 00:16:53.940
Never be cremated like ado.

302
00:16:54.050 --> 00:16:56.660
Iman have his ashes scattered a sea instead.

303
00:16:56.840 --> 00:16:59.260
Events in Europe were about to upend geopolitics.

304
00:16:59.460 --> 00:17:03.780
And one small side effect would be to me leaving Israel, a free man

305
00:17:08.970 --> 00:17:10.740
With John deman declared guilty.

306
00:17:11.100 --> 00:17:15.490
An appeals process began one that seemed cursed for the defense in November,

307
00:17:15.490 --> 00:17:18.530
1988. One of deman York's lawyers fell to his death from a 15 story window.

308
00:17:18.531 --> 00:17:20.730
And what was later ruled to suicide? A few days later,

309
00:17:20.950 --> 00:17:24.690
his lawyer Joran Shaftel had acid thrown in his face by a Holocaust survivor,

310
00:17:24.800 --> 00:17:28.810
leaving him scarred and blinded in one eye. But for all this drama in Israel,

311
00:17:28.910 --> 00:17:30.050
it would be in Eastern Europe.

312
00:17:30.270 --> 00:17:34.960
The Damian's fate was decided in 1991 with the appeals says still underway.

313
00:17:34.961 --> 00:17:39.440
The Soviet union gave one last terrific grown before collapsing into so many

314
00:17:39.500 --> 00:17:44.360
broken communist streams in Kiev and Moscow archives once held in utmost secrecy

315
00:17:44.361 --> 00:17:48.440
by the KGB were thrown open as historians raced east to make use of this

316
00:17:48.600 --> 00:17:51.040
treasure trove to man's defense team joined them.

317
00:17:51.070 --> 00:17:54.800
What they found there would forever end the TRICA survivors hope for justice.

318
00:17:55.440 --> 00:17:59.560
Ivan. The terrible had not been Ivan, Iman, 80 Trony men who'd guarded.

319
00:17:59.760 --> 00:18:03.480
Tri blinker had been taken back to Ukraine after the war questioned by the KGB,

320
00:18:03.700 --> 00:18:08.400
and then mostly executed their statements living on in boxes of dusty old

321
00:18:08.560 --> 00:18:09.170
files.

322
00:18:09.170 --> 00:18:12.470
All of them reported that Ivan Graney had been a man with the second name.

323
00:18:13.190 --> 00:18:17.430
Chenko an engineer who took great delight in running the gas motors that killed

324
00:18:17.630 --> 00:18:21.510
thousands of Jews. What happened to him after he left a blinker was unknown.

325
00:18:21.620 --> 00:18:23.710
Some said, had been shot in 1943.

326
00:18:23.910 --> 00:18:26.710
Others said that had been sent to Italy in 1944. Only to banish.

327
00:18:26.910 --> 00:18:29.780
There was even talk that had been cited in a brothel in new Yugoslavia.

328
00:18:29.781 --> 00:18:33.180
Later that same year in short, the fate of I in the terrible was unknown.

329
00:18:33.280 --> 00:18:36.820
He may have died in the war. He may have lived a long happy life,

330
00:18:36.821 --> 00:18:39.500
never once punished for all the cruelty he inflicted.

331
00:18:39.600 --> 00:18:41.740
The only thing certain was that he hadn't em,

332
00:18:42.020 --> 00:18:44.180
immigrated to the us and settled in Cleveland under the name,

333
00:18:44.370 --> 00:18:47.220
John Deen on July the 29th, 1993,

334
00:18:47.540 --> 00:18:51.210
Israel Supreme court overturned Deens can eviction. He was not. I the terrible,

335
00:18:51.430 --> 00:18:54.690
he hadn't tortured and murdered trip blinker. He was a free man,

336
00:18:54.950 --> 00:18:59.570
at least for now because the collapse of the USSR also revealed records that

337
00:18:59.571 --> 00:19:02.610
offered a different picture of de not as a monster,

338
00:19:03.310 --> 00:19:06.210
but neither as an innocent man found in Moscow.

339
00:19:06.211 --> 00:19:10.760
The confiscated internal documents of Troy Nicky cab finally offered a detailed

340
00:19:10.761 --> 00:19:14.840
picture of what Damian had done after being captured in crimee like Ivan

341
00:19:15.440 --> 00:19:17.280
Marchenko had volunteered to help the Germans.

342
00:19:17.281 --> 00:19:20.200
Like Marchenko had been trained up as Aroy man.

343
00:19:20.420 --> 00:19:24.440
And like Marchenko had been sent to players' trade in an extermination camp

344
00:19:24.441 --> 00:19:28.360
rather than tripling. It had been soor and there was no evidence.

345
00:19:28.920 --> 00:19:31.550
Damia could committed the vile stomach churning act.

346
00:19:31.910 --> 00:19:35.870
Simon Gros had what there was evidence for though was the man cuz auxiliary

347
00:19:35.871 --> 00:19:40.230
number 1, 3 93, helping her tens of thousands of Jews into the gas chambers.

348
00:19:40.231 --> 00:19:44.750
There had been no access, torture, no sword, no cutting off noses.

349
00:19:45.210 --> 00:19:45.580
No,

350
00:19:45.580 --> 00:19:50.430
just the knowledge that he was leading untold innocence to certain death and

351
00:19:50.431 --> 00:19:54.700
that it happened traded all their lives to improve his own chance of survival.

352
00:19:55.020 --> 00:19:58.500
Although Israel could have tried him again for being at so bought the government

353
00:19:58.501 --> 00:20:01.580
declined in 1993, Manuel returned to the USA,

354
00:20:01.640 --> 00:20:03.780
but with something like the truth now out there,

355
00:20:03.781 --> 00:20:05.260
there would be no welcome home party.

356
00:20:05.580 --> 00:20:09.060
Although evidence of misconduct by the DOJs office of special investigations,

357
00:20:09.820 --> 00:20:11.140
Sodo Y's citizenship,

358
00:20:12.030 --> 00:20:15.010
the examination of his past in dent by 1999,

359
00:20:15.030 --> 00:20:18.490
the DOJ had evidence of Emmanuel helping perpetrate the Holocaust,

360
00:20:18.491 --> 00:20:19.730
not just at so Bo,

361
00:20:19.790 --> 00:20:23.770
but also at Madan and floss Enberg in 2002,

362
00:20:23.890 --> 00:20:26.370
his citizenship was again revoked three years later,

363
00:20:26.630 --> 00:20:30.730
the deportation order came through at last in 2008 Germany declared it wanted to

364
00:20:30.731 --> 00:20:34.040
do extra item that be one final trial for Aman.

365
00:20:34.420 --> 00:20:37.760
And this time he would have to answer for the crimes. He really committed

366
00:20:42.820 --> 00:20:44.520
In the immediate aftermath of world war II.

367
00:20:44.521 --> 00:20:48.800
Germany didn't exactly fall over itself to try former Nazis. Oh sure.

368
00:20:48.820 --> 00:20:52.240
The worst killers were mostly convicted, but the middle men,

369
00:20:52.370 --> 00:20:56.800
those who'd willingly murdered in the concentration camps or help the Nazis

370
00:20:56.801 --> 00:20:58.720
round up undesirables. Well,

371
00:20:58.800 --> 00:21:02.080
a lot of them never saw the inside of a courtroom and were not just talking

372
00:21:02.480 --> 00:21:05.680
functionaries who passively helped the right commit its crimes.

373
00:21:05.900 --> 00:21:10.550
The histor Andreas IUL has estimated that 6,500 SS members who served at

374
00:21:11.110 --> 00:21:14.190
Auschwitz made it out of the second world war alive. Some of the vanished,

375
00:21:14.340 --> 00:21:17.870
some wented into hiding, but a lot settled back into German society.

376
00:21:18.150 --> 00:21:18.900
And the following decades,

377
00:21:18.900 --> 00:21:22.270
only a hundred of these men were ever brought to trial and Eyre 50 were

378
00:21:22.271 --> 00:21:26.870
convicted. And this was just those at Auschwitz factor in the other camps,

379
00:21:27.540 --> 00:21:30.780
thousands who'd facilitated mass murder, never paid the price.

380
00:21:31.120 --> 00:21:34.300
It was only in the 21st century that Germany seemed to have a change of heart

381
00:21:34.610 --> 00:21:38.180
that the hunts began for any surviving participants in the final solution.

382
00:21:38.720 --> 00:21:41.060
And it all started with John Damian.

383
00:21:41.540 --> 00:21:43.340
A first the feeling was he couldn't be convicted.

384
00:21:43.700 --> 00:21:45.980
President dictated that gods who'd never personally murdered.

385
00:21:45.981 --> 00:21:47.340
Anyone should be found innocent,

386
00:21:47.700 --> 00:21:51.530
especially if they were just following orders that all changed on may the 12th,

387
00:21:51.531 --> 00:21:52.364
2011.

388
00:21:52.390 --> 00:21:56.810
The day Damian was convicted as an accessory to over 27,000 murders,

389
00:21:57.570 --> 00:22:00.210
abso war the verdict overturned decades of German legal thinking.

390
00:22:00.230 --> 00:22:03.570
The judge effectively ruled that simply by helping in the act of mass murder.

391
00:22:04.130 --> 00:22:07.090
Damian was as culpable as the vanished dive and Gros knee.

392
00:22:07.150 --> 00:22:07.983
He may have been scared.

393
00:22:08.540 --> 00:22:12.400
He may have been desperate to escape the horrific conditions in the Soviet P O w

394
00:22:12.770 --> 00:22:13.340
camps.

395
00:22:13.340 --> 00:22:18.200
But the ruling said that he had a choice and in becoming aro man to

396
00:22:19.120 --> 00:22:22.520
had chosen badly in the aftermath of the case of wave of special prosecutions

397
00:22:22.530 --> 00:22:26.440
began starting in 2013 German arrest warrants were issued against dozens of

398
00:22:26.441 --> 00:22:28.480
elderly peopled been connected with the camps.

399
00:22:28.750 --> 00:22:33.550
People like the Auschwitz accountant ask a groaning convicted in 2016, age 94,

400
00:22:33.551 --> 00:22:38.510
people like Bruno day a nonagenarian who'd been a camp guard age 17 and

401
00:22:38.511 --> 00:22:42.950
found himself handed a two year sentence by a juvenile court in 2020.

402
00:22:43.140 --> 00:22:47.070
Similar cases made possible by Damian's conviction are still ongoing.

403
00:22:47.290 --> 00:22:49.540
As the script was being written 96 year old,

404
00:22:49.541 --> 00:22:54.460
former start off camp typist Igar Faria made international headlines by going on

405
00:22:54.461 --> 00:22:57.660
the run before her trial could begin. Her case is just one of 10,

406
00:22:57.661 --> 00:22:59.700
still making their way through the German legal system.

407
00:22:59.880 --> 00:23:01.740
Not that John deun would see any of this.

408
00:23:01.880 --> 00:23:06.340
The former cyber war camp guard died in a German nursing home on March the 17th,

409
00:23:07.260 --> 00:23:10.810
2012 age 91 because this appeals had not yet been exhausted.

410
00:23:10.811 --> 00:23:14.410
He technically remains innocent under German law today it's widely accepted that

411
00:23:14.690 --> 00:23:17.090
Doman was not having the terrible, but just a low level trait,

412
00:23:17.490 --> 00:23:21.530
a man who volunteered to help kill Jews to save his own skin and was never able

413
00:23:21.531 --> 00:23:25.370
to escape the consequences of that terrible decision. For some survivors,

414
00:23:25.590 --> 00:23:27.810
his eventual conviction was a source of comfort,

415
00:23:27.830 --> 00:23:31.520
acknowledgement that without these willing low level operatives,

416
00:23:31.620 --> 00:23:36.200
the Holocaust could never have been as awful as it was for others though.

417
00:23:36.201 --> 00:23:38.800
The saga of deman only dredged up horrific memories,

418
00:23:38.801 --> 00:23:41.800
acting as little more than a reminder that the real alive and the terrible,

419
00:23:42.130 --> 00:23:44.680
never faced justice for his crimes in a way,

420
00:23:44.830 --> 00:23:48.880
this paradox is the heart of deman story. He was an awful man.

421
00:23:49.600 --> 00:23:53.560
They were worse. Karma caught up with him, but others got away in the ends.

422
00:23:53.561 --> 00:23:57.880
Maybe all we can say is that John deman story is one that shows the trauma of

423
00:23:57.881 --> 00:24:02.160
Europe's 20th century of a boy who suffered then grew up to pass that suffering

424
00:24:02.320 --> 00:24:04.320
on to others in the worst way possible.

425
00:24:04.730 --> 00:24:07.790
He may not have been either the terrible, but deman was a guilty man.

426
00:24:07.791 --> 00:24:12.590
Whether he got the punishment he deserved or whether justice was really done is

427
00:24:12.591 --> 00:24:16.310
up to each of us to decide. So I hope you found that video. Interesting.
