in a bit

7
00:00:18.070 --> 00:00:18.680
Here.

8
00:00:18.680 --> 00:00:22.390
Our biographics we've covered plenty of room in and even a few figures from the

9
00:00:22.391 --> 00:00:25.350
Roman Republic. But what about the Roman kingdom?

10
00:00:25.730 --> 00:00:29.630
The earliest period from Romans long and rich history, unfortunately,

11
00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:33.550
Romans from the Regor period were not the detailed record keepers that their

12
00:00:33.551 --> 00:00:34.750
descendants would become.

13
00:00:34.770 --> 00:00:38.830
<v 1>So most of that history is based on legends and or traditions,</v>

14
00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:41.580
but we're gonna give it a today.

15
00:00:41.581 --> 00:00:46.540
We're gonna take a look at Luin Tarquin Superbus the last king of Rome.

16
00:00:46.600 --> 00:00:48.900
We will be examining his family heritage and the many,

17
00:00:49.210 --> 00:00:54.020
many murderous plots that first caused his rise power, and later his downfall,

18
00:00:54.021 --> 00:00:56.060
which not only represented the end of his reign,

19
00:00:56.120 --> 00:01:01.060
but the end of the entire Roman monarchy and the birth of the Republic.

20
00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:08.650
<v 0>Before we head to tar wind,</v>

21
00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:12.610
we should look briefly at the Roman kingdom itself as, as a whole,

22
00:01:12.770 --> 00:01:14.410
as a part of history that is often overlooked.

23
00:01:14.590 --> 00:01:17.210
The Regal period lasted for around 250 years,

24
00:01:17.211 --> 00:01:20.890
roughly between 750 and 500 BC. Traditionally,

25
00:01:20.891 --> 00:01:24.160
there are seven record Kings of Rome. Although realistically,

26
00:01:24.161 --> 00:01:26.400
there could have been more or less. For example,

27
00:01:26.401 --> 00:01:29.360
most of us have heard of the first king Romulus, the founder of Rome,

28
00:01:29.420 --> 00:01:33.160
the boy who was raised by a shul for alongside his twin brother, Remus,

29
00:01:33.161 --> 00:01:36.960
who later murdered his sibling during a dispute over where to found then new

30
00:01:36.961 --> 00:01:38.000
city unsurprisingly,

31
00:01:38.001 --> 00:01:40.800
many scholars considered the tale of Romulus entirely legendary.

32
00:01:40.801 --> 00:01:44.790
So whether or naughty was a historical figure who served as king is up for

33
00:01:44.791 --> 00:01:47.990
debate. The problem here is a complete lack of contemporary sources.

34
00:01:48.180 --> 00:01:50.070
This is common French and times in general,

35
00:01:50.250 --> 00:01:54.870
but not so much for the Romans who were usually pretty good at documenting their

36
00:01:54.871 --> 00:01:57.830
history. If records from these times did exist at some points,

37
00:01:57.860 --> 00:02:00.870
they would've likely been destroyed in 390 BC.

38
00:02:00.871 --> 00:02:03.340
When the city of Rome was sacked for the first time,

39
00:02:03.440 --> 00:02:06.220
our main source for the Roman kingdom is the historian levy,

40
00:02:06.221 --> 00:02:08.780
whose book is the history of Rome covers. Well,

41
00:02:08.880 --> 00:02:12.500
it covers the history of Rome since it's founding to the birth of the embar

42
00:02:12.501 --> 00:02:13.500
under Augustus,

43
00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:17.620
but even he lived almost 500 years after the last king was overthrown.

44
00:02:17.680 --> 00:02:20.900
So he certainly relied on a lot of hearsay and legends.

45
00:02:21.030 --> 00:02:25.930
Other historians who covered this time period include Caius do and Dar or

46
00:02:26.410 --> 00:02:29.690
ACI, but their works have not survived in their entirety.

47
00:02:29.691 --> 00:02:33.250
So when you get fragments about the reign of Tarquin from them.

48
00:02:33.430 --> 00:02:34.850
So let's start at the beginning.

49
00:02:35.370 --> 00:02:38.610
Romulus founded the city of Roman served as its first king unsurprisingly.

50
00:02:38.611 --> 00:02:42.050
He wielded almost total power since he was in charge of the military,

51
00:02:42.230 --> 00:02:45.960
the chief priest and the head of the executive judicial and legislative

52
00:02:45.961 --> 00:02:49.440
branches. Surprisingly though the Roman Senate existed from the very beginning,

53
00:02:49.441 --> 00:02:54.280
according to li Romulus created it and named 100 senators from among Rome's most

54
00:02:54.310 --> 00:02:55.320
influential families.

55
00:02:55.530 --> 00:03:00.120
Those original 100 were given the title of pars signifying that they held

56
00:03:00.400 --> 00:03:02.840
complete authority within their families. Better descendants.

57
00:03:02.841 --> 00:03:07.320
Weren't known as S although the dump later ly referred to all members of Romes

58
00:03:07.440 --> 00:03:10.800
ruling class, regardless of whether or not they were descended from Padres.

59
00:03:10.801 --> 00:03:13.600
<v 1>The Roman kingdom also had several assemblies chief among them,</v>

60
00:03:13.620 --> 00:03:16.280
the curator assembly, however, like the senates,

61
00:03:16.400 --> 00:03:19.990
their authority was mostly symbolic as their may in function was to simply enact

62
00:03:20.010 --> 00:03:22.590
the decree of the king. There was one exceptions of this,

63
00:03:22.690 --> 00:03:25.630
and that was when it was time to find a new king. Surprisingly,

64
00:03:25.631 --> 00:03:29.230
the Roman Kings were elected and they were not named by their predecessors.

65
00:03:29.470 --> 00:03:30.310
Whenever a king died,

66
00:03:30.320 --> 00:03:34.310
Roman did a brief period called an interregnum where the Senate had the power.

67
00:03:34.420 --> 00:03:39.300
<v 0>They then chose one among them and named him into regs and his duty to</v>

68
00:03:39.301 --> 00:03:40.660
serve as a provisional ruler,

69
00:03:40.740 --> 00:03:43.580
ensuring that the transition to the next king went smoothly.

70
00:03:43.581 --> 00:03:47.260
Each Inex could only serve for five days after which he was replaced by another

71
00:03:47.261 --> 00:03:47.880
Senator.

72
00:03:47.880 --> 00:03:51.220
He had the power to nominate a new king and presented them before the curator

73
00:03:51.620 --> 00:03:55.220
assembly, which decided whether or not they had the right stuff for the throne.

74
00:03:55.460 --> 00:03:58.380
A religious ceremony followed to ensure that the candidate had also had the

75
00:03:58.500 --> 00:04:00.250
approval of the gods. And afterwards,

76
00:04:00.251 --> 00:04:03.490
there was the final vote to see if this candidate would become the new king of

77
00:04:03.491 --> 00:04:04.324
Rome

78
00:04:10.170 --> 00:04:14.690
Lu Tarquin Superbus was born sometime around the mid sixth century. BC,

79
00:04:15.130 --> 00:04:17.570
assuming that our knowledge of the seven Kings is accurate.

80
00:04:17.710 --> 00:04:21.520
He was the only one who was actually dis it from one of the previous rulers.

81
00:04:21.540 --> 00:04:25.000
He was the son of the fifth king Luci Tarquin Pritzker,

82
00:04:25.060 --> 00:04:28.040
who retroactively became known as Tarquin the elder,

83
00:04:28.250 --> 00:04:32.000
while his son was referred to his, Tarquin the proud to help distinguish them.

84
00:04:32.060 --> 00:04:35.520
His mother was named Tanque and neither her Nora husband were born in Rome.

85
00:04:35.521 --> 00:04:39.200
According to li they were both Tuscans, an ancient Italian civilization,

86
00:04:39.340 --> 00:04:41.990
the predated, the Roman, and came from ATRIO,

87
00:04:41.991 --> 00:04:45.070
which was a region that mainly corresponds to Tuscany today,

88
00:04:45.100 --> 00:04:47.790
plus parts of and Lao percus.

89
00:04:47.810 --> 00:04:51.870
And Tanaquil had married back home in Auria. They both came from wealthy family,

90
00:04:51.970 --> 00:04:53.910
so they had money, but they didn't have status.

91
00:04:54.140 --> 00:04:57.710
Some of the biggest privileges were off limits to PCUs because he was not fully

92
00:04:57.790 --> 00:05:01.740
a trun as his father was a Corinthian noble refugee named demo.

93
00:05:02.300 --> 00:05:05.020
Rattus therefore the couple decided to move to Rome where there wasn't so much

94
00:05:05.021 --> 00:05:07.100
focus on heritage yet on their way there,

95
00:05:07.101 --> 00:05:10.900
they received an Oman from the gods when an Eagle sweeps down and picked up

96
00:05:11.580 --> 00:05:13.140
percuss hat, circled the air for a while,

97
00:05:13.200 --> 00:05:16.740
and then descended again and placed the hat gently on the head from when it came

98
00:05:17.100 --> 00:05:20.100
tan world became convinced that this meant that a husband would be crowned king

99
00:05:20.120 --> 00:05:23.570
one day and resolved to see E this prophecy fulfilled, no matter the cost,

100
00:05:23.571 --> 00:05:26.970
because regardless if it was a kingdom or a public or an em empire,

101
00:05:27.280 --> 00:05:30.370
Rome was never short on political injury conspiracy,

102
00:05:31.090 --> 00:05:35.010
hence the occasional assassination and the period that followed had all of these

103
00:05:35.011 --> 00:05:38.570
things in spades dark when the elder and his wife arrived in Rome during the

104
00:05:38.571 --> 00:05:42.720
reign of the fourth king ANSYS Barus presumably they had all their children

105
00:05:42.810 --> 00:05:46.080
after their relocation to the new city, they had four offspring,

106
00:05:46.081 --> 00:05:49.080
two boys and two girls. That was the younger Tarquin of course,

107
00:05:49.081 --> 00:05:52.280
plus his brother Aaron's Tarquin and two daughters.

108
00:05:52.281 --> 00:05:54.680
And at least one of them was also called Tarquin.

109
00:05:55.100 --> 00:06:00.040
So certainly not a lot of variety P percus proved himself to be an able and

110
00:06:00.041 --> 00:06:02.560
cunning businessman. And he not only enlarged his fortune,

111
00:06:02.780 --> 00:06:05.520
but he became a trusted advisor to the king. At one point,

112
00:06:05.800 --> 00:06:08.360
an Marcias even named PPRI as the guardian of his children.

113
00:06:08.540 --> 00:06:12.360
He had two sons and it was assumed that one of them would be elected as the new

114
00:06:12.361 --> 00:06:16.240
king when they came of age. But the tars had other plans.

115
00:06:16.510 --> 00:06:18.430
It was said that after anchors Marus died,

116
00:06:18.990 --> 00:06:21.550
Tarquin arranged for his sons to be away on a hunting trip.

117
00:06:21.551 --> 00:06:24.990
When it was time to decide on a new king, he then canvas Rome for votes,

118
00:06:24.991 --> 00:06:28.110
going from person to person and presenting himself as the best candidate for the

119
00:06:28.111 --> 00:06:30.830
job. It seems that he made a good impression because Tarquin,

120
00:06:30.831 --> 00:06:32.510
the elder was elected as the fifth king of Rome,

121
00:06:32.511 --> 00:06:36.950
around 616 BC to the displeasure of anchor's offspring.

122
00:06:37.160 --> 00:06:39.660
The senior Tarquin had a long reign of almost 40 years.

123
00:06:39.720 --> 00:06:42.820
He expanded Rome's borders by conquering. Many of its neighbors.

124
00:06:43.020 --> 00:06:46.540
He added another a hundred people to the Senate and he enacted notable

125
00:06:46.541 --> 00:06:47.460
construction projects,

126
00:06:47.461 --> 00:06:51.020
such as the city's first bridge and the first version of the circus Maximus

127
00:06:51.080 --> 00:06:51.940
during his reign,

128
00:06:51.941 --> 00:06:56.340
the story of another Roman emerged one concerning a young slave boy named SEIUs

129
00:06:56.860 --> 00:06:57.693
Tuli who my,

130
00:06:57.770 --> 00:07:01.170
they used to be a noble woman before our city was captured by the Romans. Again,

131
00:07:01.171 --> 00:07:03.130
we're relying heavily on Livy here,

132
00:07:03.131 --> 00:07:06.890
but the historian claims that the young boys had was encircled by flames one day

133
00:07:06.891 --> 00:07:07.480
as he slept,

134
00:07:07.480 --> 00:07:10.810
when he awakes the flames simply disappeared without causing him any harm.

135
00:07:10.860 --> 00:07:13.610
Queen town qui interpreted this as a sign that one day,

136
00:07:13.611 --> 00:07:17.170
the boy would be there guiding light and would shield the house from harm.

137
00:07:17.350 --> 00:07:20.400
We don't know if the Tarras officially adopted Sevi Julius,

138
00:07:20.401 --> 00:07:21.880
that they raised him in their household.

139
00:07:21.881 --> 00:07:25.280
And later even married him to their daughter. Tarquin by all accounts,

140
00:07:25.281 --> 00:07:28.720
it looked like the tarns were positioning SEVIS Julius as their air,

141
00:07:28.950 --> 00:07:30.800
even over their own two sons.

142
00:07:30.801 --> 00:07:33.480
This could be because they felt he was more competent than them,

143
00:07:33.660 --> 00:07:37.480
but it could also be that they were strong believers in Omans or they could also

144
00:07:37.620 --> 00:07:41.470
be simply be Tuus was much older than their legitimate sons. Again,

145
00:07:41.570 --> 00:07:45.630
we don't really have any idea when tar, when the proud was born.

146
00:07:45.810 --> 00:07:49.830
So it's all a bit of guesswork really, since his father's reign lasted so long,

147
00:07:49.831 --> 00:07:52.550
he could have been decades younger than Tuus and consequently,

148
00:07:52.770 --> 00:07:55.230
not a suitable candidate for kingship when the time came,

149
00:07:55.340 --> 00:07:58.550
some sources present tar, when the proud as the grand son of Pritzker,

150
00:07:58.570 --> 00:08:02.180
not his son, and even li said that he was not completely sure.

151
00:08:02.240 --> 00:08:06.140
So it is fairly reasonable to conclude that he was too young to follow in tar in

152
00:08:06.141 --> 00:08:07.100
the eldest footsteps.

153
00:08:07.440 --> 00:08:09.900
Now we'll have more on the last room in king in just a moment,

154
00:08:10.000 --> 00:08:13.740
but first a word from today's outstanding video sponsor square space. You know,

00:09:30.410 --> 00:09:31.950
And let's get back to talk in the proud

184
00:09:38.500 --> 00:09:42.540
Positioning, Seus Julius, as the new presumptive air anger, the son's anus,

185
00:09:43.060 --> 00:09:45.500
Markus, they already Harbor deep presentment toward tar.

186
00:09:45.700 --> 00:09:48.700
When the elder for depriving them of what they considered to be their rightful

187
00:09:48.701 --> 00:09:49.040
throne.

188
00:09:49.040 --> 00:09:53.140
And now they regarded the idea of someone like Julius becoming the new king to

189
00:09:53.141 --> 00:09:54.340
be a great insult.

190
00:09:54.550 --> 00:09:57.490
We're not sure why exactly they waited for almost four decades,

191
00:09:57.750 --> 00:10:01.410
but they finally decided that it was time to get their revenge on Tarquin.

192
00:10:01.730 --> 00:10:04.610
Their plan was hardly the work of a criminal masterminds.

193
00:10:04.611 --> 00:10:07.610
They enlisted the help of two shepherds who entered the palace and started

194
00:10:07.611 --> 00:10:11.490
having a violent quarrel. That is the guards intervened and temple settled down.

195
00:10:11.491 --> 00:10:13.890
The shepherds were brought before the king to state their case.

196
00:10:14.410 --> 00:10:16.640
While one of them was talking and held everyone what his attention,

197
00:10:16.740 --> 00:10:19.680
the other one produced an accent, drove it into the King's head.

198
00:10:19.700 --> 00:10:23.120
And then they both quickly made a run for it. Ken Tarn, the elder was dead,

199
00:10:23.180 --> 00:10:27.080
but it was his wife's quick thinking that ensure their family would not lose the

200
00:10:27.081 --> 00:10:29.800
throne. She didn't allow word that the king had died to get out.

201
00:10:29.900 --> 00:10:32.920
As far as the rest of Rome was concerned, Taren had been attacked,

202
00:10:32.921 --> 00:10:34.960
but he was recovering at home. Meanwhile,

203
00:10:34.980 --> 00:10:38.030
he seated temporary authority to jus to act in his place.

204
00:10:38.260 --> 00:10:42.390
This went on for a few days before jus revealed that Tarkin was dead and that he

205
00:10:42.391 --> 00:10:45.790
had been ruling on his own. By that point, his authority was already secure.

206
00:10:45.810 --> 00:10:49.070
So Seus Julius became the sixth king of Roman. The first one,

207
00:10:49.090 --> 00:10:50.310
not to be elected by the people.

208
00:10:50.910 --> 00:10:54.270
Julius also appeared to have a long reign spanning several decades.

209
00:10:54.570 --> 00:10:58.220
But during that time he considered the possibility that tar in's own sons had

210
00:10:58.360 --> 00:11:03.140
the same kind of animosity towards him as the sons of anus Marcius and towards

211
00:11:03.141 --> 00:11:07.700
his predecessor til thought he could alleviate some of that entity by marrying

212
00:11:07.701 --> 00:11:10.980
his two daughters, both named Tulio to tar Quinn's two sons,

213
00:11:11.240 --> 00:11:14.580
Lucius Tarquin Superbus and Aaron's Tarquin.

214
00:11:15.380 --> 00:11:18.530
This did not turn out like TEUs had hoped because Neil, the couple paired, well,

215
00:11:18.910 --> 00:11:22.330
Lucius Tarens was conniving, greedy and lustful for power.

216
00:11:22.331 --> 00:11:25.290
While his wife Twilio, the elder was not meanwhile,

217
00:11:25.450 --> 00:11:28.010
Tulia theca was also conniving, greedy and lustful for power.

218
00:11:28.011 --> 00:11:32.530
While her husband Aaron Quins was not Livy said it was the good fortune of room,

219
00:11:32.531 --> 00:11:36.410
which intervenes in order to prevent the two violent scheming personalities from

220
00:11:36.411 --> 00:11:39.640
marrying each other. But it didn't not managed to stop them.

221
00:11:40.120 --> 00:11:43.480
Mazi only delayed their partnerships soon in enough Tarquin and Tulia,

222
00:11:43.481 --> 00:11:46.320
the younger realized that they were made for each other first things. First,

223
00:11:46.350 --> 00:11:50.200
they had to get rid of their spouses. It's uncertain how Tulio the elder died,

224
00:11:50.260 --> 00:11:54.360
but Aaron Quins was supposedly poisoned by his wife afterwards,

225
00:11:54.420 --> 00:11:56.200
the two unscrupulous partners in crime,

226
00:11:56.201 --> 00:11:59.440
married each other and began plotting against Tuus to the throne.

227
00:12:00.200 --> 00:12:03.360
Tarquin first secured the support of all the senators who had grievances against

228
00:12:03.590 --> 00:12:05.800
Tuus. This did not prove to be too difficult.

229
00:12:05.990 --> 00:12:08.400
Many of the lesser houses were on tar Quinn's side,

230
00:12:08.401 --> 00:12:11.680
since it was his father who originally adopted them to the senates.

231
00:12:12.040 --> 00:12:15.350
Then there are all the ones who resented Julius for taking power without being

232
00:12:15.351 --> 00:12:18.310
elected. Once Tarquin was confident that he had enough support.

233
00:12:18.330 --> 00:12:21.230
He stormed the forum with armed guards into the Senate house,

234
00:12:21.550 --> 00:12:24.270
sat on the Royal chair and gave an impasioned speech denigrating.

235
00:12:24.540 --> 00:12:27.950
Tuus focusing mainly on his roots as a slave and his illegitimate rice.

236
00:12:28.010 --> 00:12:29.390
The throne when Julius arrived,

237
00:12:29.391 --> 00:12:31.870
the two of them got into an argument which turned physical, the younger,

238
00:12:31.910 --> 00:12:33.580
stronger Tarquin had at the, a advance.

239
00:12:33.840 --> 00:12:36.140
He holds the king down the steps of the Senate house.

240
00:12:36.540 --> 00:12:39.620
His armed guards then rushed to the Tuus and put him to death.

241
00:12:39.640 --> 00:12:43.100
But the greatest wickedness was displayed by the King's zone daughter, Tulia.

242
00:12:43.120 --> 00:12:46.620
She arrived at the forum in a car and her driver stopped suddenly in horror,

243
00:12:46.980 --> 00:12:49.260
as he saw the mangled corpse of SEIUs Tuus,

244
00:12:49.261 --> 00:12:53.460
but Tulia then ordered him to drive right over a father's body and approached

245
00:12:53.550 --> 00:12:56.050
the Senate house to be the first to salute. Tarquin.

246
00:12:56.051 --> 00:12:57.610
The proud is the new king of Rome

247
00:13:03.920 --> 00:13:07.450
With Julius out of the way Tarran was now free to begin his reign of terror men.

248
00:13:07.451 --> 00:13:07.950
Indeed.

249
00:13:07.950 --> 00:13:11.370
It was that because Tarquin knew that he had no legitimate claims that the

250
00:13:11.530 --> 00:13:14.560
kingdom having been neither elected by the people nor confirmed either Senate.

251
00:13:14.780 --> 00:13:18.640
He also realized that what he had done to Tuus could very easily happen to him.

252
00:13:18.860 --> 00:13:20.800
And so he saw no other choice,

253
00:13:20.940 --> 00:13:23.960
but to use violence and fear to secure his position,

254
00:13:24.260 --> 00:13:27.200
he started out with a purge killing all the senators and other Nobles.

255
00:13:27.201 --> 00:13:30.080
He suspected might be loyal to his predecessor afterwards.

256
00:13:30.081 --> 00:13:33.000
He began holding trials with no counselors or assessors,

257
00:13:33.001 --> 00:13:37.870
basically just being able to execute banish or simply find anyone he wanted with

258
00:13:37.871 --> 00:13:38.750
no justification.

259
00:13:38.930 --> 00:13:42.190
He also refused to fill the vacancies in the Senate in order to weaken it as

260
00:13:42.191 --> 00:13:43.310
much as possible. In fact,

261
00:13:43.330 --> 00:13:46.670
Cassie SDO claimed that Tarquin wanted to get rid of the Senate permanently,

262
00:13:46.730 --> 00:13:49.270
but felt that this was a step too far, even for him.

263
00:13:49.270 --> 00:13:52.630
And that it would cause a revol so great that he in his own guards would turn

264
00:13:52.631 --> 00:13:54.910
against him. Once he felt confidence in his position,

265
00:13:55.500 --> 00:13:57.020
Tarquin embarked on a campaign of conquest,

266
00:13:57.220 --> 00:13:59.820
determined to turn Romans of the most dominant power in the region.

267
00:14:00.160 --> 00:14:02.820
He fought some of the neighbors such as the VCI,

268
00:14:02.960 --> 00:14:05.580
the Saines and the city of Gaddy others.

269
00:14:05.800 --> 00:14:10.100
He befriended through treaties such as the Tuscans and the city of Tusculum

270
00:14:10.340 --> 00:14:14.220
whose leader Octas Maus became tar Quinn's son-in-law. Meanwhile,

271
00:14:14.221 --> 00:14:16.770
the king also worked on ambitious projects inside Rome.

272
00:14:17.010 --> 00:14:19.970
Although some of these have been initiated by his father ands completed by

273
00:14:19.971 --> 00:14:22.010
Tarquin among them was the Cloaka Maxima.

274
00:14:22.011 --> 00:14:25.130
One of the world's first sewage systems and the first version of the temple of

275
00:14:25.131 --> 00:14:27.890
Jupiter Optima Maximas built on the capital Dean hill,

276
00:14:27.891 --> 00:14:31.610
which retained its significant as the most important temple in Rome throughout

277
00:14:31.611 --> 00:14:32.430
the ancient period,

278
00:14:32.430 --> 00:14:35.890
the king was also responsible for acquiring one of Rome's most cherished art

279
00:14:36.400 --> 00:14:38.360
acts collection of prophecies, divinations,

280
00:14:38.460 --> 00:14:41.800
and other IRA wisdoms known as the SI lane books.

281
00:14:41.950 --> 00:14:43.560
According to the legends,

282
00:14:43.760 --> 00:14:47.880
an old prophet house called Sibel visited Rome one day, carrying nine books,

283
00:14:48.260 --> 00:14:52.240
she went to Tarquin and offered to sell him the books of prophecies for a huge

284
00:14:52.300 --> 00:14:54.400
sum of money. When he refused the civil burns,

285
00:14:54.401 --> 00:14:57.320
three of these books and then offered to sell him the remaining six,

286
00:14:57.321 --> 00:15:00.280
but for the same exact amount this time, the king was more hesitant,

287
00:15:00.580 --> 00:15:03.960
but he still turned down the deal. The Sibel then burns another three books.

288
00:15:03.961 --> 00:15:06.360
And once again, asked Tarquin to buy the three which were left,

289
00:15:06.380 --> 00:15:08.520
but she did not change the price at all. Finally,

290
00:15:08.540 --> 00:15:11.150
the king relented and purchased the remaining three books,

291
00:15:11.160 --> 00:15:13.990
which were placed inside. The apple mentioned temple of Jupiter,

292
00:15:14.270 --> 00:15:16.910
Renon consulted during times of crisis, such as a plague,

293
00:15:17.030 --> 00:15:18.150
a famine or a great war.

294
00:15:24.390 --> 00:15:27.550
Darwin's ruthless rain asking cemented Romans regional power,

295
00:15:27.710 --> 00:15:31.510
but it also created a powder keg of hate fear and resentment in a,

296
00:15:31.580 --> 00:15:35.300
his own people just waiting for that one event that finally caused it to

297
00:15:35.301 --> 00:15:39.940
explode. That event happens in 510 BC, but it was not caused by Tarquin himself,

298
00:15:39.941 --> 00:15:42.940
but by one of his son's sexist, Quins beautiful.

299
00:15:43.100 --> 00:15:45.220
And in love with a noble woman named Lucia,

300
00:15:45.240 --> 00:15:49.820
but she was already married to one of his cousins, Lucia Tarquin collaterals.

301
00:15:50.090 --> 00:15:51.780
This did not deter sexist. However,

302
00:15:52.090 --> 00:15:56.170
he visited Lucretia while her husband was way busying the city of our day.

303
00:15:56.180 --> 00:16:00.090
First, he tried to seduce her then to bribe her and finally to threaten her.

304
00:16:00.091 --> 00:16:02.770
But none of these worked as Lucretia remained faithful to her husband.

305
00:16:02.960 --> 00:16:06.250
Finally sexist said that he would kill her and her servants and place their

306
00:16:06.251 --> 00:16:09.730
naked bodies together so that it would appear like they were caught in UL rape

307
00:16:09.731 --> 00:16:12.170
to this Lucia relented and sexist raped her.

308
00:16:12.170 --> 00:16:15.920
After it industry sent word to her father and husband to come home immediately.

309
00:16:16.060 --> 00:16:19.760
She told both of them what had happens, made them swear oath to punish sex, to,

310
00:16:20.000 --> 00:16:22.320
and then committed suicide. They set in motion,

311
00:16:22.440 --> 00:16:26.480
a chain of events that went far beyond the punishment of sex to Quins who was

312
00:16:26.880 --> 00:16:29.080
late killed in the city of Gabby. Strangely enough,

313
00:16:29.081 --> 00:16:32.440
it was not a husband CLA who became the leading figure of the anti roll

314
00:16:32.441 --> 00:16:35.870
movements. Another Tarquin named Lucius ju Brutus,

315
00:16:35.970 --> 00:16:37.550
who was the sound of tar when's sister,

316
00:16:37.770 --> 00:16:40.910
but hated the king because he had both his father and brother killed and their

317
00:16:41.070 --> 00:16:43.510
property confiscated in Li's version of events.

318
00:16:43.990 --> 00:16:45.030
Brutus picked up the bloody knife.

319
00:16:45.430 --> 00:16:49.430
Lure used to commit suicide and SW oath to the gods to bring down Lucius tar

320
00:16:50.390 --> 00:16:52.910
when's and his whole bred with fire and sort,

321
00:16:53.050 --> 00:16:56.140
he then past the knife to coladas who swore the same oath.

322
00:16:56.460 --> 00:17:00.940
And then to two other men lure who was lure father and Publius malarias

323
00:17:01.210 --> 00:17:04.260
Cola, as it turns out, no fire and sword was necessary.

324
00:17:04.261 --> 00:17:07.620
As the people of Rome didn't need a lot of convincing to get rid of the Tarquin

325
00:17:07.850 --> 00:17:10.940
both li and Cassius dos said the British simply rode to Rome,

326
00:17:10.941 --> 00:17:15.850
went to the forum and spoke to the people of the latest act committed by the tar

327
00:17:15.860 --> 00:17:18.410
winds and easily turned the crowd against the Royals.

328
00:17:18.411 --> 00:17:22.330
They then held a vote and banished Tarquin and his family afterwards Brutus

329
00:17:22.570 --> 00:17:26.250
wrote to ode where the Roman army was and basically gave the same speech,

330
00:17:26.251 --> 00:17:28.490
turning the soldiers against Tarquin as well.

331
00:17:28.550 --> 00:17:33.530
The question now was who's going to rule Rome according to some versions of the

332
00:17:33.531 --> 00:17:35.160
story Brutus made and swear,

333
00:17:35.320 --> 00:17:38.080
I that they would never allow a man to become king of Rome. Again,

334
00:17:38.140 --> 00:17:39.960
the Senate was restored to its full ranks.

335
00:17:39.960 --> 00:17:42.960
So of course it played a large role in the running of Rome going forward,

336
00:17:43.060 --> 00:17:45.560
but the city still needed someone at the top. Therefore,

337
00:17:45.580 --> 00:17:49.560
the office of console was created with two consoles governing simultaneously so

338
00:17:49.561 --> 00:17:51.280
that no one man became too powerful.

339
00:17:51.460 --> 00:17:54.320
The first two consoles were Brutus and collates.

340
00:17:54.720 --> 00:17:56.640
Although the public soon turned against the latter,

341
00:17:56.870 --> 00:17:59.240
even though Lucretia had been colada's wife,

342
00:17:59.300 --> 00:18:03.160
he was still related to the Towes and the people of Rome decided that they

343
00:18:03.161 --> 00:18:05.280
didn't want any Tarquin in any position of power.

344
00:18:05.350 --> 00:18:09.030
Therefore collates was forced to resign and was replaced by public Koa,

345
00:18:09.310 --> 00:18:10.990
but about king Tarquin unsurprisingly,

346
00:18:10.991 --> 00:18:13.030
once he found out he was no longer welcomed in Rome,

347
00:18:13.050 --> 00:18:15.150
he didn't just pack up his bags and call it a day.

348
00:18:15.310 --> 00:18:19.350
Although Cassius Dio did mention that tar Quinn's wife Tulia destroyed herself

349
00:18:19.460 --> 00:18:21.590
when she discovered what had happened. Anyway,

350
00:18:21.591 --> 00:18:24.870
Tarquin still had treaties with neighboring cities and he hopes that they would

351
00:18:24.871 --> 00:18:28.150
be able to restore him to power. First, he turned to the Tuscan, a few cities,

352
00:18:28.180 --> 00:18:29.660
such as Tarka Quinn IANS.

353
00:18:29.930 --> 00:18:34.140
They lent their support and they fought a Roman army led by the two consoles at

354
00:18:34.141 --> 00:18:37.900
the battle of Sylvia AIA and 509 BC. The Romans won,

355
00:18:38.220 --> 00:18:40.780
although the man who was instrumental in bringing down the monarchy,

356
00:18:41.180 --> 00:18:44.260
Lucius genius, Brutus was killed in action almost 500 years later,

357
00:18:44.320 --> 00:18:45.820
his descendants Marcus juniors,

358
00:18:46.220 --> 00:18:49.300
Brutus played another pivotal role in the history of Rome when he assassinated

359
00:18:50.090 --> 00:18:52.130
Caesar, although he wasn't as successful,

360
00:18:52.230 --> 00:18:55.690
but you can find out more about that in the biographics video we did on Marcus

361
00:18:56.050 --> 00:18:59.530
Jr. Brutus under third to then appealed to LA pina,

362
00:18:59.710 --> 00:19:02.810
the king of a powerful of TRUS city named Kusum in 508,

363
00:19:02.990 --> 00:19:06.370
BC pina laid C John Rome, but ultimately he wasn't successful.

364
00:19:06.371 --> 00:19:08.730
And he signed a peace treaty with Rome. We're not sure why,

365
00:19:08.750 --> 00:19:11.960
but li he tells the story of it. Brave young Roman named Muus,

366
00:19:11.980 --> 00:19:16.000
who SN POS camp to assassinate him. However, a case, a mistake,

367
00:19:16.120 --> 00:19:18.640
an identity caused him to kill the king scribe by mistake,

368
00:19:18.700 --> 00:19:22.560
during interrogation Muus willingly put his own hand in the fire to show that he

369
00:19:22.561 --> 00:19:23.520
was not afraid to die.

370
00:19:23.521 --> 00:19:26.560
Some say that POS was moved by the young man's bravery others,

371
00:19:26.561 --> 00:19:29.360
that he was simply shook up by the attempt on his life.

372
00:19:29.361 --> 00:19:33.470
Either way he lived did the seed returned to Clusium tar Quinn's last attempt to

373
00:19:33.471 --> 00:19:37.750
retake the throne occurred with the help of his son-in-law Octavius Maus leader

374
00:19:37.770 --> 00:19:40.870
of the Tusculum. This happened around 496 BC.

375
00:19:40.970 --> 00:19:43.990
It was over a decade later and Taan was an old man. By this point,

376
00:19:44.090 --> 00:19:46.630
he still held out hope, but it was eventually extinguished.

377
00:19:46.631 --> 00:19:51.340
The battle of lake reus, where Maus was killed. Tarquin had no more allies left.

378
00:19:51.400 --> 00:19:55.300
He retired to the city of kuai the court of the tyrant Aris Demus and he died

379
00:19:55.301 --> 00:19:57.460
soon after ER, fond 95.

380
00:19:57.700 --> 00:20:00.580
BC news of his death was met with joy back in Romes,

381
00:20:00.581 --> 00:20:05.060
both BLEs and Patricias celebrated not only the demise of tar in the proud but

382
00:20:05.061 --> 00:20:07.820
of the entire Roman monarchy. So I really hope you enjoyed the video.
