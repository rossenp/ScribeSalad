check out the game through the link in the description below,

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:10.230
and you can start with three extra weapons or a vehicle cabin just for

00:00:10.231 --> 00:00:11.064
registering

5
00:00:16.970 --> 00:00:18.620
Francis Drake, the English.

6
00:00:18.890 --> 00:00:23.300
Remember as a hero who made nautical history and enabled that country's maritime

7
00:00:23.301 --> 00:00:27.170
dominance, the Spanish. Remember in his El DRAC the dragon,

8
00:00:27.171 --> 00:00:31.460
the man who ravaged that colonies and destroyed their Armada. As you'll soon,

9
00:00:31.461 --> 00:00:34.790
find out there are valid reasons to dislike frog's history.

10
00:00:34.850 --> 00:00:37.370
Especially when looked at through a modern lens.

11
00:00:37.550 --> 00:00:41.000
He was ruthless and authoritarian. When it came to commanding his ships,

12
00:00:41.150 --> 00:00:43.400
he was involved in slavery for awhile,

13
00:00:43.550 --> 00:00:45.560
and he took part in at least one massacre,

14
00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:49.790
but there is no way to deny his many accomplishments and the long-term effects

15
00:00:49.791 --> 00:00:51.170
they had on history.

16
00:00:51.380 --> 00:00:55.430
As Francis Drake firmly established himself as one of the greatest and the most

17
00:00:55.431 --> 00:00:58.850
daring Naval commanders and explorers in history.

18
00:00:59.240 --> 00:01:00.073
<v 1>Three.</v>

19
00:01:05.750 --> 00:01:07.160
<v 0>The strike was born second of 15,</v>

20
00:01:07.161 --> 00:01:11.300
14 near Tavistock and the English County of Devin's Edmunds and

21
00:01:11.330 --> 00:01:13.640
Mary Drake, the oldest of 12 siblings.

22
00:01:13.730 --> 00:01:17.420
His father had been a sailor in his used before being ordained as a minister and

23
00:01:17.421 --> 00:01:19.070
to some soon followed in his steps.

24
00:01:19.550 --> 00:01:23.150
Edmonds found Francis his first position to board a ship when he was a teenager.

25
00:01:23.151 --> 00:01:24.410
And by the time he turned 18,

26
00:01:24.411 --> 00:01:28.400
Francis Drake had already been made the passer of a ship sailing to the Bay of

27
00:01:28.401 --> 00:01:31.010
Biscay, the person who was the person who handled the money.

28
00:01:31.011 --> 00:01:33.800
So while not a position that required skill and experience,

29
00:01:33.980 --> 00:01:37.400
it did show the amount of trust that was placed in young Drake.

30
00:01:37.460 --> 00:01:38.510
When he was 20 years old,

31
00:01:38.660 --> 00:01:42.350
Francis Drake made his first long distance voyage traveling to the coast of

32
00:01:42.351 --> 00:01:45.140
Guinea in West Africa, a border slaving vessel.

33
00:01:45.170 --> 00:01:48.350
They belonged to one of England's most prominent Naval commanders at the time,

34
00:01:48.620 --> 00:01:52.610
John Hawkins Hawkins at the dubious distinction of being considered England's

35
00:01:52.611 --> 00:01:53.660
first slave trader,

36
00:01:53.900 --> 00:01:58.280
who overcame his own country's laws by collecting slaves from Africa and selling

37
00:01:58.281 --> 00:02:00.320
them to Spanish colonies in the new world.

38
00:02:00.410 --> 00:02:04.070
He also happens to be an older cousin of Drake and took the young sailor under

39
00:02:04.071 --> 00:02:05.780
his wing as his protege.

40
00:02:05.890 --> 00:02:08.840
All of this was happening during the outset of the age of discovery.

41
00:02:08.841 --> 00:02:13.610
A period in European history marked by exploration global trade and colonial

42
00:02:13.611 --> 00:02:14.270
empires.

43
00:02:14.270 --> 00:02:18.350
Naval dominance has never been more important since it was simply impossible to

44
00:02:18.351 --> 00:02:21.260
become a global power without having a strong Navy,

45
00:02:21.320 --> 00:02:23.330
the most powerful fleet at the time in Europe,

46
00:02:23.331 --> 00:02:26.480
at least belonged to Spain who were England's sworn enemy,

47
00:02:26.630 --> 00:02:30.740
even though the two countries were not engaged in open war. Not yet anyway,

48
00:02:30.890 --> 00:02:33.770
but there was a lot of private hearing going on,

49
00:02:33.771 --> 00:02:37.550
meaning that private ships sent permission from their governments do engage

50
00:02:37.551 --> 00:02:41.000
enemy vessels in battle without fear of repercussions.

51
00:02:41.060 --> 00:02:45.050
Drake's first transatlantic voyage occurred around 1566 when he sailed aboard a

52
00:02:45.380 --> 00:02:48.950
private hearing fleet owned by Hawkins and captains by John Lovell.

53
00:02:48.980 --> 00:02:50.720
They first went to West Africa again,

54
00:02:50.900 --> 00:02:54.170
where they attacked Portuguese slave ships in coastal towns. Afterwards,

55
00:02:54.171 --> 00:02:56.600
they sailed to the Americas where they sold the slaves,

56
00:02:56.601 --> 00:03:00.880
do plantations and return to England with their cargo holds full of gold sugar

57
00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:02.440
hides and precious metals.

58
00:03:02.470 --> 00:03:05.580
Technically this wasn't allowed since most of the colonies in the new world

59
00:03:05.890 --> 00:03:09.850
belong to Spain and they did not allow trade with the English boss as always

60
00:03:10.180 --> 00:03:11.800
money spoke the loudest.

61
00:03:11.801 --> 00:03:16.270
And there were plenty of Spanish outposts willing to ignore the edict and do

62
00:03:16.271 --> 00:03:20.230
some business. This was a profitable trip for Hawkins. So unsurprisingly,

63
00:03:20.260 --> 00:03:22.000
he scheduled another one for the following year.

64
00:03:22.210 --> 00:03:25.330
This time he had a fleet of six ships headed by Hawkins himself,

65
00:03:25.510 --> 00:03:27.100
a bolt dominion, Frances Dre.

66
00:03:27.160 --> 00:03:29.620
He could also risen through the ranks ends on this voyage.

67
00:03:29.621 --> 00:03:33.520
He was captain of his own ship Bach called the Judith.

68
00:03:33.580 --> 00:03:36.310
The journey started off as the previous ones. First,

69
00:03:36.311 --> 00:03:40.390
the fleet went to West Africa to collect slaves and then headed for America to

70
00:03:40.391 --> 00:03:44.050
sell them once their business was complete, the ships were ready to return home,

71
00:03:44.051 --> 00:03:46.630
but they encountered a powerful storm off the coast of Florida.

72
00:03:46.900 --> 00:03:49.390
They were too damaged to make the transatlantic journey.

73
00:03:49.391 --> 00:03:53.830
So instead they sailed to a nearby port to repair and resupply.

74
00:03:53.890 --> 00:03:56.530
The posing question was San Juan Lujan today,

75
00:03:56.531 --> 00:03:59.830
part of the city of Veracruz and Mexico. Soon after they pulled into Harbor,

76
00:04:00.010 --> 00:04:01.660
a powerful Spanish fleet arrived,

77
00:04:01.661 --> 00:04:04.270
which contains the Viceroy of new Spain himself,

78
00:04:04.840 --> 00:04:07.570
Don Martin on recasts the situation was very tense,

79
00:04:07.571 --> 00:04:10.930
but after days of negotiations, it seems like a pact was reached,

80
00:04:10.931 --> 00:04:14.050
which would allow the English ships to leave the port on harms.

81
00:04:14.080 --> 00:04:17.730
This was not to be though because the Viceroy broke the pack since attacked to

82
00:04:17.731 --> 00:04:19.960
the English fleet. They quickly turned into a sorter.

83
00:04:19.990 --> 00:04:23.080
The English lost four of the six ships, 500 men.

84
00:04:23.110 --> 00:04:26.500
And most of that plunder only the Judith and the minion managed to escape.

85
00:04:26.530 --> 00:04:30.850
But this was only after they abandoned more men on the coast to ease the burden.

86
00:04:31.030 --> 00:04:34.390
The battle had a significant impact on the already strange relationship between

87
00:04:34.391 --> 00:04:37.300
England and Spain, the Spanish Viceroy considered this.

88
00:04:37.510 --> 00:04:41.620
He acted justly since what Hawkins was doing was technically piracy.

89
00:04:41.621 --> 00:04:44.440
So he had every right to engage them in combat in waters,

90
00:04:44.441 --> 00:04:46.300
over which he claimed sovereignty. The English.

91
00:04:46.301 --> 00:04:49.750
On the other hand is considered a scornful act of treachery and Drake in

92
00:04:49.751 --> 00:04:53.830
particular developed a hatred for all things, Spanish and vowed revenge.

93
00:04:59.100 --> 00:04:59.933
<v 1>[Inaudible].</v>

94
00:05:00.780 --> 00:05:04.740
<v 0>That Boeing's on Francis Drake dedicated himself to privateering well focusing</v>

95
00:05:04.770 --> 00:05:08.340
solely on Spanish targets, despite his relative lack of experience,

96
00:05:08.341 --> 00:05:11.850
he was given commission of two ships, the dragon and the Swan,

97
00:05:11.851 --> 00:05:15.960
and found no shortage of volunteers willing to take on Spain in 1517,

98
00:05:15.961 --> 00:05:19.470
he set off on his first independent voyage and then another one the following

99
00:05:19.471 --> 00:05:23.370
year, but only aboard the SWAT. He sailed to the West Indies both times.

100
00:05:23.371 --> 00:05:27.750
Although what he did that is unclear if he did engage in any Naval combat,

101
00:05:27.751 --> 00:05:29.490
it wasn't anything major, more likely.

102
00:05:29.491 --> 00:05:33.060
These missions were intended to gather information on the strength of the enemy

103
00:05:33.150 --> 00:05:35.310
in the region and to show the people back home,

104
00:05:35.311 --> 00:05:39.390
that it was possible to sail these treacherous waters and returned to England

105
00:05:39.450 --> 00:05:40.950
safe and sound dregs.

106
00:05:40.951 --> 00:05:45.480
First genuine privateering expedition took place in 1572 when he decided to

107
00:05:45.481 --> 00:05:47.400
launch raids on the isthmus of Panama,

108
00:05:47.490 --> 00:05:51.540
which connected North and South America and its surrounding areas that region,

109
00:05:51.541 --> 00:05:55.740
which the Spanish cooled Terrafirma Drake set sail on March the 24th.

110
00:05:55.830 --> 00:06:00.800
He had two ships at his, the 25 tons Swan, and they knew a larger vessel.

111
00:06:00.801 --> 00:06:05.180
The 70 ton patch up Drake, and they had a small crew of 73 men and boys,

112
00:06:05.181 --> 00:06:08.180
but he supplemented his forces by using the old adage.

113
00:06:08.300 --> 00:06:11.360
The enemy of my enemy is my friends in South America.

114
00:06:11.361 --> 00:06:13.520
He allied himself with former African slaves.

115
00:06:13.521 --> 00:06:15.950
He managed to escape that capitalism live as Outlaws.

116
00:06:16.010 --> 00:06:20.600
The Spanish golden Semaron meaning wild or unruly, although to the English,

117
00:06:20.630 --> 00:06:22.550
they became known as the Maroons.

118
00:06:22.610 --> 00:06:26.120
These men had a large presence in the area and sometimes work together with the

119
00:06:26.121 --> 00:06:30.230
English and French pirates bonding over their mutual hatred of the Spanish

120
00:06:30.320 --> 00:06:34.580
English privateer arrived in Panama in July and launched a raid on the town of

121
00:06:34.581 --> 00:06:36.830
number dos. It was a small targets.

122
00:06:36.860 --> 00:06:40.460
That's an important one because the Spanish used it as a port of call to

123
00:06:40.461 --> 00:06:44.420
transfer their loot from that treasure fleet in the Pacific ocean to galleons

124
00:06:44.510 --> 00:06:48.800
waiting in the Caribbean seat. Unfortunately for Drake, his timing was off,

125
00:06:48.890 --> 00:06:51.410
even though he was successful in sacking the town.

126
00:06:51.650 --> 00:06:55.670
He did it when there was no John shipments of precious metals waiting to be

127
00:06:55.671 --> 00:06:58.520
taken to Spain. Not only did he find nothing to blunder,

128
00:06:58.640 --> 00:07:01.640
but he also sustained a serious injury during the attack,

129
00:07:01.670 --> 00:07:05.240
which forced him to abandon naan bread, to deals and returned to his ship.

130
00:07:05.241 --> 00:07:08.270
Soon after that, there is a popular story from this event,

131
00:07:08.300 --> 00:07:09.740
which said that while in town,

132
00:07:09.920 --> 00:07:13.250
Drake climbs up a tree and saw the Pacific ocean for the first time.

133
00:07:13.310 --> 00:07:17.630
And it was a foreshadowing swore that he would one day sail those waters.

134
00:07:17.690 --> 00:07:20.870
This was also the time when Francis Drake met Diego,

135
00:07:20.871 --> 00:07:24.650
a former slave who would join his crew and go on to become one of the most

136
00:07:24.651 --> 00:07:27.350
useful and loyal many hats right off the bat.

137
00:07:27.440 --> 00:07:32.300
Diego proved his worth by organizing a meeting between Drake and Pedro Mandingo,

138
00:07:32.330 --> 00:07:35.000
the leader of a local simmer and group,

139
00:07:35.060 --> 00:07:38.540
and this secured a valuable Alliance for the English privateers with the help of

140
00:07:38.541 --> 00:07:42.740
Drake was able to set up a Fort on a small Island in the Gulf of sun blasts off

141
00:07:42.741 --> 00:07:43.670
the coast of Panama,

142
00:07:43.820 --> 00:07:46.550
which he used as his base of operations for the following year.

143
00:07:46.730 --> 00:07:49.190
Occasionally launching minor raids against the Spanish,

144
00:07:49.220 --> 00:07:53.420
but mostly waiting for the opportune time to get a big score in honor,

145
00:07:53.450 --> 00:07:56.900
of his new resourceful friends, Drake named it forced Diego.

146
00:07:57.050 --> 00:07:58.040
Also during this time,

147
00:07:58.041 --> 00:08:02.000
Drake secured another ally in the form of a French privateer named Gillum.

148
00:08:02.120 --> 00:08:05.810
The tester that big school finally came in April 15, 73,

149
00:08:05.960 --> 00:08:09.950
almost a year after Drake at first arrived in Panama together as the English,

150
00:08:09.951 --> 00:08:14.090
the French and the Cimarron plugs at the Spanish silver train mule train route

151
00:08:14.091 --> 00:08:18.110
used to transport golden silver across the SMS in order to ship it to Spain,

152
00:08:18.170 --> 00:08:21.680
the precious cargo was protected by almost 200 Spanish soldiers,

153
00:08:21.681 --> 00:08:24.410
but the elements of surprise gave the edge to the attackers.

154
00:08:24.620 --> 00:08:26.030
Even if they were outnumbered,

155
00:08:26.120 --> 00:08:28.580
the loot proved to be far beyond their expectations.

156
00:08:28.700 --> 00:08:31.370
The whole was around 30 tons of golden silver.

157
00:08:31.520 --> 00:08:35.030
It was so much treasure that the privateers and the Cimarron couldn't even carry

158
00:08:35.031 --> 00:08:38.120
it all and to have to bury part of it and the banks of a nearby river,

159
00:08:38.360 --> 00:08:41.420
hoping they might one day return. Not everyone got to enjoy the plunge.

160
00:08:41.690 --> 00:08:43.490
The test died soon after the battle,

161
00:08:43.640 --> 00:08:46.460
the French privateer was initially injured during the fighting.

162
00:08:46.490 --> 00:08:49.610
Then he ended a couple of his men stayed behind to rest for a while before

163
00:08:49.790 --> 00:08:51.170
catching up to the rest of the party.

164
00:08:51.260 --> 00:08:52.700
They'd all got a little bit too long though.

165
00:08:52.701 --> 00:08:56.310
And a second Spanish force ran into them and executed them on the spot.

166
00:08:56.460 --> 00:08:57.840
As far as Drake was concerned,

167
00:08:57.841 --> 00:09:02.070
his mission in Panama was competed and he soon returned to England with 20,000

168
00:09:02.071 --> 00:09:06.810
pounds in golden Silva. Becca Drake was regarded by many as a hero,

169
00:09:06.811 --> 00:09:10.290
but they could not acknowledge his privateering efforts officially since in the

170
00:09:10.291 --> 00:09:11.010
meantime,

171
00:09:11.010 --> 00:09:14.250
England and Spain inside a temporary truce and the English government had

172
00:09:14.400 --> 00:09:17.790
promised to stop any kind of support for privateers rating Spanish territories

173
00:09:17.910 --> 00:09:18.630
in the new Wells.

174
00:09:18.630 --> 00:09:21.930
This also meant that Drake had to find something else to do for the time being.

175
00:09:21.930 --> 00:09:24.810
So queen Elizabeth asked him to take part in a new program.

176
00:09:24.811 --> 00:09:28.740
She initiated called the enterprise of all step basically is involved,

177
00:09:28.741 --> 00:09:32.640
convincing English entrepreneurs to set up new businesses in areas of Ireland,

178
00:09:32.970 --> 00:09:34.470
where there were still an armed resistance.

179
00:09:34.500 --> 00:09:36.540
Drake was supposed to help keep the peace,

180
00:09:36.541 --> 00:09:38.880
but he ended up doing the exact opposite.

181
00:09:38.910 --> 00:09:42.390
There are two events that will forever tarnish Drake's legacy.

182
00:09:42.660 --> 00:09:44.250
The first we already talked about,

183
00:09:44.251 --> 00:09:47.700
and that was his involvement in the slave trade during his first years as a

184
00:09:47.701 --> 00:09:51.480
sailor. The second was his role in one of the worst massacres in Irish history,

185
00:09:51.690 --> 00:09:56.580
known as the Rathlin Island massacre Rosslyn castle on the eponymous Island

186
00:09:56.581 --> 00:10:00.720
was used as a hiding place and base of operations for the Irish resistance led

187
00:10:00.721 --> 00:10:02.910
by the McDonald's of Antrim. In fact,

188
00:10:02.940 --> 00:10:06.570
it was considered so safe that other groups sent their families there as well.

189
00:10:06.630 --> 00:10:10.650
However, Henry Sydney law, deputy of Ireland as appointed by queen Elizabeth,

190
00:10:10.800 --> 00:10:13.650
heard of this stronghold and wanted it eliminated as a threat.

191
00:10:13.770 --> 00:10:14.850
He sent two forces,

192
00:10:14.851 --> 00:10:19.530
one led by dragons the other by sir John Norris to storm the castle after

193
00:10:19.531 --> 00:10:20.760
battering the wolves with Canada,

194
00:10:21.060 --> 00:10:24.240
Vajra it became clear that the Irish resistance had no chance of winning.

195
00:10:24.450 --> 00:10:26.010
So they surrendered despite this,

196
00:10:26.011 --> 00:10:29.430
the attack has executed all the remaining soldiers and when they were finished,

197
00:10:29.431 --> 00:10:33.270
they hunted down and slaughtered around 400 civilians who mainly consisted of

198
00:10:33.271 --> 00:10:37.740
women, children, the sick and the elderly Drake's precise role is uncertain.

199
00:10:37.850 --> 00:10:42.060
As some of his defenders argue that the actual massacre was committed by Nerys

200
00:10:42.061 --> 00:10:46.290
and his men, while Drake stayed behind on his ship to ensure that no resistance

201
00:10:46.291 --> 00:10:48.540
reinforcements came to the Island. And look,

202
00:10:48.541 --> 00:10:51.420

for yourself. So stick on some rail guns, stick on a rocket booster. Awesome.

212

Mama runs off you, go on your journey way, build it well, and you will dominate,

213
00:11:26.870 --> 00:11:30.710
build it badly. And you, well, probably just won't work out for you,

214
00:11:30.740 --> 00:11:32.390
but there are easy ways to avoid that.

The biographics our sponsors really do make this whole thing possible.

229
00:12:15.701 --> 00:12:17.860
So thanks to cross out and let's get back to the video.

230
00:12:24.300 --> 00:12:24.730
<v 1>[Inaudible].</v>

231
00:12:24.730 --> 00:12:27.540
<v 0>Years later, Drake gold, the private hearing itch. Again,</v>

232
00:12:27.720 --> 00:12:31.260
he sold enough time had passed and that it was okay for him to start attacking

233
00:12:31.261 --> 00:12:35.820
the Spanish once more and well queen Elizabeth agreed, not even the, of course,

234
00:12:35.821 --> 00:12:39.120
but the queen ends many influential members of her course funded a new

235
00:12:39.121 --> 00:12:42.450
expedition for Drake larger and more ambitious than before.

236
00:12:42.540 --> 00:12:44.070
Drake had five ships at his command.

237
00:12:44.200 --> 00:12:48.150
The flagship was a 120 ton galleon named the Pelican,

238
00:12:48.151 --> 00:12:52.650
which drank later renamed to the golden Hinz in the middle of the journey to

239
00:12:52.651 --> 00:12:56.370
honor one of his patrons officially this enterprise was branded a voyage of

240
00:12:56.371 --> 00:12:59.430
discovery, Drake plans that navigate the straits of Magellan,

241
00:12:59.431 --> 00:13:03.330
the first Englishman to do so, and then explore the Pacific ocean. In reality,

242
00:13:03.360 --> 00:13:07.410
this was a rating expedition and Drake fully intended to attack every Spanish

243
00:13:07.411 --> 00:13:11.820
town and ship that he met along the way in an effort to weaken the control that

244
00:13:11.821 --> 00:13:14.490
Spain had on the Pacific coast of the Americas.

245
00:13:14.610 --> 00:13:17.910
His original plan was to keep going North once he was in the Pacific and

246
00:13:18.090 --> 00:13:21.990
hopefully find a way back to the Atlantic by crossing the Arctic ocean.

247
00:13:22.140 --> 00:13:24.120
Of course, Drake did not know this at the time,

248
00:13:24.121 --> 00:13:28.380
but what he was referring to was the treacherous Northwest passage that passed

249
00:13:28.381 --> 00:13:30.330
through the Canadian Arctic archipelago.

250
00:13:30.480 --> 00:13:33.900
It would be another 300 years before that route would be navigated for the first

251
00:13:33.901 --> 00:13:37.080
time by Roldan Munson and other pioneering Explorer,

252
00:13:37.081 --> 00:13:38.890
who we've already covered here at biographics.

253
00:13:38.891 --> 00:13:41.970
So maybe you check out that video if you haven't already. Anyway,

254
00:13:42.000 --> 00:13:45.720
Drake ended up making it further up North than any previous European,

255
00:13:45.810 --> 00:13:49.050
but he obviously had no business trying to navigate the Arctic ocean.

256
00:13:49.230 --> 00:13:50.190
So he had no choice,

257
00:13:50.191 --> 00:13:54.660
but to keep heading West crossing the whole Pacific and then the Indian

258
00:13:54.661 --> 00:13:57.480
oceans rounding the Cape of good hope in Africa.

259
00:13:57.630 --> 00:14:00.480
And then finally sailing the Atlantic ocean. Once more,

260
00:14:00.600 --> 00:14:04.440
as a consequence of this Francis Drake's expedition became the second in history

261
00:14:04.441 --> 00:14:08.160
to circle the globe. After the NASA Ferdinand Magellan 55 years earlier,

262
00:14:08.430 --> 00:14:12.270
Drake became the first commander to lead an entire circumnavigation because

263
00:14:12.271 --> 00:14:15.300
although we often say the Magellan completed the first circumnavigation in

264
00:14:15.301 --> 00:14:18.960
history, this is only partially correct. His expedition completed this,

265
00:14:19.050 --> 00:14:20.640
but Magellan himself did not.

266
00:14:20.700 --> 00:14:24.120
He was killed in the Philippines and one of his officers harmed Sebasty and Al

267
00:14:24.600 --> 00:14:27.300
Cano let the rest of the journey, but we're getting ahead of ourselves.

268
00:14:27.301 --> 00:14:31.440
We know how it was going to end. Let's get back to the start of Trix voyage.

269
00:14:31.500 --> 00:14:36.450
He set sail from Plymouth on December the 15th, 1577, after a lengthy delay,

270
00:14:36.600 --> 00:14:38.160
he first began to do a bit of action. You know,

271
00:14:38.161 --> 00:14:40.770
the Cape Verde islands off the Northwest point of Africa,

272
00:14:40.980 --> 00:14:44.910
where he plundered Spanish and Portuguese ships even added one to his fleet.

273
00:14:45.060 --> 00:14:48.330
Renaming it's the Mary from its original center, Maria,

274
00:14:48.420 --> 00:14:49.890
his most valuable addition, however,

275
00:14:49.920 --> 00:14:54.740
was a Portuguese pilot named know-how to Silva who was experienced in navigating

276
00:14:54.890 --> 00:14:57.950
the South American waters and to agree to help Drake on his voyage,

277
00:14:58.280 --> 00:15:01.670
upon reaching South America, Drake decided to make landfall in port St.

278
00:15:01.671 --> 00:15:03.560
Julian today, part of Argentina,

279
00:15:03.600 --> 00:15:07.190
the same place where Magellan had landed 58 years prior here,

280
00:15:07.250 --> 00:15:10.460
the problem started piling up due to heavy losses on his crossing of the

281
00:15:10.461 --> 00:15:14.510
Atlantic ocean Drake no longer had the manpower to maintain six ships.

282
00:15:14.511 --> 00:15:17.960
So he decided to scuttle two of his smaller vessels. Meanwhile,

283
00:15:18.050 --> 00:15:20.660
in this new edition, the Mary, it turns out to have rotting woods.

284
00:15:20.661 --> 00:15:23.330
So they broke it for parts and burn the rest down.

285
00:15:23.331 --> 00:15:27.080
And just as long as that is sick ship fleet was reduced to three,

286
00:15:27.140 --> 00:15:31.970
but his biggest problem came in the form of officer Thomas doubty doubty started

287
00:15:31.971 --> 00:15:35.570
off as one of Drake's most valuable men, even being given command of the Mary.

288
00:15:35.570 --> 00:15:36.860
At one point, however,

289
00:15:36.890 --> 00:15:40.640
during the Atlantic crossing the relationship between the two men took a drastic

290
00:15:40.641 --> 00:15:44.750
turn for the worst of first downs was demoted, then placed under house arrest.

291
00:15:44.751 --> 00:15:49.550
And then finally convicted on charges of witchcraft sons penalty of death Dowty

292
00:15:49.580 --> 00:15:53.120
was executed in the same spot when the gellan did the same with mutineers about

293
00:15:53.121 --> 00:15:55.530
his own ship. The message was pretty clear.

294
00:15:55.640 --> 00:15:59.420
Drake was the one in charge here and he would not tolerate any challenges to his

295
00:15:59.421 --> 00:16:03.320
authority even. So Dante's execution caused quite a stir back in England.

296
00:16:03.321 --> 00:16:07.940
And even now scholars argue whether Drake was in the right or if it was a

297
00:16:07.970 --> 00:16:11.810
flagrant abuse of power waltzing through the Strait of Magellan caused even more

298
00:16:11.811 --> 00:16:12.350
problems.

299
00:16:12.350 --> 00:16:15.350
One of the three remaining ships was lost along with everyone on board.

300
00:16:15.351 --> 00:16:19.340
And another one became separated in a storm and got so badly damaged that it's

301
00:16:19.341 --> 00:16:20.150
men demanded.

302
00:16:20.150 --> 00:16:23.570
They had back home upon emerging in the Pacific old Drake now have,

303
00:16:23.660 --> 00:16:26.960
was this flagship, the golden Hinze and less than half of the crew,

304
00:16:26.961 --> 00:16:29.300
he started with things looked pretty grim for him,

305
00:16:29.330 --> 00:16:32.480
but he soon found a measure of good fortune because the Spanish had completely

306
00:16:32.481 --> 00:16:34.850
dominated the waters on the Pacific coast for decades.

307
00:16:35.030 --> 00:16:37.580
Nobody was really expecting an English rating party,

308
00:16:37.670 --> 00:16:40.310
almost all the merchant ships and the coastal towns,

309
00:16:40.311 --> 00:16:44.120
Drake plundered were taken by surprise and nearly defenseless.

310
00:16:44.180 --> 00:16:47.180
It wasn't this time that Drake took the richest prize of his career,

311
00:16:47.240 --> 00:16:48.920
a treasure galleon names, the nitrous,

312
00:16:49.010 --> 00:16:52.940
and Nora did it Concepcion better known by the colorful moniker of [inaudible].

313
00:16:52.970 --> 00:16:56.360
Eventually the Spanish learned of Drake's presence and sends a fleet after him,

314
00:16:56.390 --> 00:16:58.520
but then have a quarter up to the golden hinders.

315
00:16:58.521 --> 00:17:02.750
It traveled up North reaching the upper coast of California upon making landfall

316
00:17:02.780 --> 00:17:07.580
Drake names, the bland Nova Albion, new Albion and themed for queen Elizabeth.

317
00:17:07.580 --> 00:17:10.280
The first, he didn't actually leave anyone to form a colony though,

318
00:17:10.281 --> 00:17:12.230
because he couldn't spare the manpower.

319
00:17:12.231 --> 00:17:15.560
And it's the actual location of new Albion became a subject of debate for

320
00:17:15.561 --> 00:17:16.460
centuries today.

321
00:17:16.461 --> 00:17:20.510
The U S government officially recognizes port as California as Drake's landing

322
00:17:20.511 --> 00:17:23.540
spot and designated. It it's a national historic landmark.

323
00:17:23.630 --> 00:17:26.930
Once he realized there was no way to cross the Atlantic up North Drake kept

324
00:17:26.931 --> 00:17:30.020
sailing westerns unintentionally circumnavigated the globe.

325
00:17:30.050 --> 00:17:32.780
Once he was out of Spanish waters, the biggest danger had passed,

326
00:17:32.781 --> 00:17:34.820
but he still encountered a few perils.

327
00:17:34.850 --> 00:17:38.660
Sometimes the natives were hostile to him. Also most turned out to be friendly,

328
00:17:38.690 --> 00:17:41.330
especially in India and Indonesia, but one occasion,

329
00:17:41.331 --> 00:17:45.560
his ship got stuck in a reef and he had to literally throw tons of ownable cargo

330
00:17:45.561 --> 00:17:46.910
overboard to lighten the load.

331
00:17:47.000 --> 00:17:50.430
He also lost his trusted sidekick Diego during that part of the trip,

332
00:17:50.431 --> 00:17:54.390
as he died from wounds previously sustained in South America while fighting them

333
00:17:54.450 --> 00:17:57.420
or push people along mocker islands. But for the most part,

334
00:17:57.450 --> 00:18:01.020
it was smooth sailing until Drake was back in England on September the 26th,

335
00:18:01.021 --> 00:18:02.190
1580 there,

336
00:18:02.200 --> 00:18:05.670
he discovered that most people had assumed that he and his entire crew had

337
00:18:05.671 --> 00:18:06.360
perished.

338
00:18:06.360 --> 00:18:09.570
And he could not be given a proper celebration because the English ground could

339
00:18:09.571 --> 00:18:12.690
not officially acknowledge his actions against Spain, even.

340
00:18:12.691 --> 00:18:14.880
So the voyage had been an astounding success,

341
00:18:14.881 --> 00:18:18.120
not just from a historical point of view, but a financial one as well.

342
00:18:18.210 --> 00:18:21.990
It's estimated that Drake's supporters got paid back 47 pounds for every one

343
00:18:21.991 --> 00:18:25.380
pounds. They invested a profit return of 4600%.

344
00:18:25.410 --> 00:18:29.130
Drake himself became incredibly rich and powerful and was knighted by queen

345
00:18:29.131 --> 00:18:30.300
Elizabeth a year later

346
00:18:36.540 --> 00:18:37.281
For the next few years.

347
00:18:37.281 --> 00:18:40.700
Drake settled down for a bit serving as the mayor of Plymouth and does a member

348
00:18:40.701 --> 00:18:42.650
of parliament in 1595. However,

349
00:18:42.651 --> 00:18:46.790
all pretenses of peace between England and Spain were dropped and war broke out

350
00:18:46.791 --> 00:18:48.950
between the two nations. It was only a matter of time,

351
00:18:49.250 --> 00:18:52.370
really ends now Francis Drake was free to go private hearing again,

352
00:18:52.490 --> 00:18:55.820
launching a preemptive strike against the Spanish colonies of the new world.

353
00:18:55.910 --> 00:18:59.990
He mainly focused his efforts on port towns located in modern day Columbia and

354
00:18:59.991 --> 00:19:03.290
the Dominican Republic as most notable action during this time actually had

355
00:19:03.291 --> 00:19:07.190
nothing to do with the war, but with the notorious colony of Roanoke,

356
00:19:07.191 --> 00:19:10.460
England's first failed attempt to do permanent settlement in North America.

357
00:19:10.490 --> 00:19:13.580
Drake passed by Roanoke islands on his way back and found the colonists

358
00:19:13.610 --> 00:19:14.270
starving.

359
00:19:14.270 --> 00:19:17.780
He took most of them back to England while the ones who stayed behind were never

360
00:19:17.781 --> 00:19:18.614
heard from again,

361
00:19:18.770 --> 00:19:22.250
the tanks in the new worlds did not concern Spain too much because King Phillip,

362
00:19:22.251 --> 00:19:24.650
the second set a much more ambitious plan in mind,

363
00:19:24.890 --> 00:19:29.180
he was preparing to invade England by mid 1597. He was almost ready,

364
00:19:29.181 --> 00:19:32.300
but it was Francis Dre who again, foiled his plans.

365
00:19:32.600 --> 00:19:34.550
Drake was busy attacking Spanish trade routes,

366
00:19:34.551 --> 00:19:38.210
trying to cause as much disruption as possible in April, 1587.

367
00:19:38.211 --> 00:19:39.860
He arrived at the poor city of CodeHS,

368
00:19:39.861 --> 00:19:43.610
where he founds a large Spanish fleet and tons of supplies sitting in

369
00:19:43.611 --> 00:19:46.730
anticipation of the invasion with the elements of surprise on his side,

370
00:19:46.760 --> 00:19:50.840
Drake took his own fleet and launched a daring attack on April the 29th against

371
00:19:50.841 --> 00:19:54.470
the ships waiting in the Harbor because raid was a massive success is great

372
00:19:54.471 --> 00:19:57.650
managed to sync around 30 Spanish ships while Boonie losing one,

373
00:19:57.830 --> 00:20:01.340
not to mention all the supplies that were destroyed and all the other vessels he

374
00:20:01.341 --> 00:20:02.810
plundered during this expedition,

375
00:20:02.960 --> 00:20:05.480
all in all this delayed the Spanish invasion for about a year.

376
00:20:05.510 --> 00:20:09.320
And it became mockingly known in England as singeing, the King of Spain's Viet.

377
00:20:09.380 --> 00:20:10.640
But even with this success,

378
00:20:10.641 --> 00:20:14.330
Drake still knew that a full-scale attack on England was inevitable on may the

379
00:20:14.810 --> 00:20:15.531
28, 1588,

380
00:20:15.531 --> 00:20:19.400
the Spanish Armada set sail for the English channel comprising 130 ships

381
00:20:19.401 --> 00:20:22.760
carrying 18,000 soldiers and 8,000 sailors.

382
00:20:22.910 --> 00:20:27.080
The English had a hundred vessels at their disposal commanded by Lord Charles

383
00:20:27.080 --> 00:20:29.270
Howard with Drake serving as his vice Admiral,

384
00:20:29.330 --> 00:20:31.970
the Spanish intended to focus on Malai battle.

385
00:20:32.000 --> 00:20:35.990
Thus employing that powerful inventory by dropping them off on lands and by

386
00:20:35.991 --> 00:20:38.490
boarding enemy ships, the English and long range cannons.

387
00:20:38.491 --> 00:20:41.840
So they preferred to keep this fight at a distance as much as possible.

388
00:20:41.900 --> 00:20:43.940
Even when the Amada made landfall in Kalai,

389
00:20:43.941 --> 00:20:47.890
the English forced them back into open water by sending far ships into their

390
00:20:47.891 --> 00:20:51.040
midst and then bombarding them with Canon fire. Once more,

391
00:20:51.280 --> 00:20:54.640
the definitive battle happens near grave lines on August the eighth.

392
00:20:54.730 --> 00:20:58.210
It lasted only a little over eight hours, but the English were victorious.

393
00:20:58.390 --> 00:21:02.230
The Spanish Armada might've been able to regroup and launch a new attack where

394
00:21:02.231 --> 00:21:04.090
it not for incredibly bad weather,

395
00:21:04.180 --> 00:21:07.420
powerful winds for citizens in the middle of the North sea and with the English

396
00:21:07.421 --> 00:21:10.450
fleet behind it, it couldn't turn around and go home. Instead,

397
00:21:10.451 --> 00:21:13.120
it had to take the long way rounds, rounding Scotland and Ireland,

398
00:21:13.270 --> 00:21:16.960
continuous storms sank many more ships while others were around aground ground

399
00:21:16.961 --> 00:21:19.510
on the shore, combine this with disease and lack of supplies.

400
00:21:19.630 --> 00:21:23.410
And the return voyage caused far more casualties to Spain than the actual

401
00:21:23.830 --> 00:21:26.710
flight. Only about 2000 Spanish soldiers died fighting the English,

402
00:21:26.740 --> 00:21:28.690
but by the time the I'm automated back home,

403
00:21:28.870 --> 00:21:32.110
almost half of the ships had been lost. And around 15,000 men.

404
00:21:32.130 --> 00:21:32.963
<v 1>The diet.</v>

405
00:21:38.880 --> 00:21:42.000
<v 0>This was another giant feather in Drake's cap buzz.</v>

406
00:21:42.030 --> 00:21:45.990
It was the last one he'll ever get. He still has a few good years left,

407
00:21:46.020 --> 00:21:49.620
but it all went quickly downhill from that a year later in 1589,

408
00:21:49.621 --> 00:21:53.430
England launched the Drake Norris expedition popularly called the English or

409
00:21:53.580 --> 00:21:56.820
counter Armada. Its purpose was clear permanently cripple,

410
00:21:56.821 --> 00:22:01.350
Spain as a Naval power by destroying what remained of its fleet and also provide

411
00:22:01.351 --> 00:22:05.040
aid to the Portuguese who were at the time rebelling against King Philip.

412
00:22:05.100 --> 00:22:09.120
This endeavor sent down to be what some considered the greatest Naval disaster

413
00:22:09.450 --> 00:22:13.200
in English history. First Drake chose to attack the city of at Karuna.

414
00:22:13.300 --> 00:22:15.510
Although his exact reasoning is unclear.

415
00:22:15.540 --> 00:22:19.050
Some say he may have believed a legend that the city tower held a vast gold

416
00:22:19.051 --> 00:22:19.770
treasure.

417
00:22:19.770 --> 00:22:22.890
He destroyed the ships in the Harbor and plundered the village easily enough,

418
00:22:22.920 --> 00:22:26.580
but failed to capture the fortress and lost thousands of men in the siege before

419
00:22:26.581 --> 00:22:27.660
being forced to retreat.

420
00:22:27.840 --> 00:22:32.040
Then he went to Lisbon where the infantry bled by Norris was supposed to support

421
00:22:32.070 --> 00:22:36.210
Portuguese rebels, but was soundly defeated by the Spanish Garrison. Lastly,

422
00:22:36.270 --> 00:22:39.420
Drake wanted to sail to the Azores to intercept interceptor, treasure fleets,

423
00:22:39.421 --> 00:22:41.670
but powerful storms forced him back to England.

424
00:22:41.730 --> 00:22:43.050
By the time Drake made it back home,

425
00:22:43.260 --> 00:22:47.160
he had sustained losses that rivaled those of the Spanish Armada things went

426
00:22:47.161 --> 00:22:48.450
from bad to worse for Drake.

427
00:22:48.451 --> 00:22:51.720
As he tried to go back to his roots with another privateering campaign in South

428
00:22:51.721 --> 00:22:54.780
America, maybe it was his advanced age to blame this.

429
00:22:54.900 --> 00:22:58.290
The man who had previously been so successful could not buy a victory anymore.

430
00:22:58.440 --> 00:23:00.120
He suffered one defeat after another,

431
00:23:00.121 --> 00:23:03.960
both on land and on the sea after failings or plans of the port of Panama Drake

432
00:23:04.320 --> 00:23:06.870
fellow with dysentery and early 1596,

433
00:23:06.960 --> 00:23:11.010
he died a few weeks later on January the 28th aged around 55.

434
00:23:11.160 --> 00:23:13.440
Drake was buried at sea off the coast of portabello,

435
00:23:13.500 --> 00:23:16.980
allegedly in and deadlines coffin while wearing a full suit of armor near at the

436
00:23:17.340 --> 00:23:18.210
wrecks of two of his ships.

437
00:23:18.270 --> 00:23:21.570
The shipwrecks have been located in modern times and divers think is only a

438
00:23:21.571 --> 00:23:25.890
matter of time until they also discover the final resting place of Francis

439
00:23:25.891 --> 00:23:29.040
Drake, the dragon. So I really hope you enjoyed that video.
