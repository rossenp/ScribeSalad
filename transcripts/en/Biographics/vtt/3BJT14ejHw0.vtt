1
00:00:00.070 --> 00:00:03.920
<v 0>It's often said women have to work twice as hard as men to get half the credit.</v>

2
00:00:04.060 --> 00:00:06.520
But what happens when you take that logic and apply it,

3
00:00:06.521 --> 00:00:07.360
not in the world of work,

4
00:00:07.780 --> 00:00:10.640
but to the criminal underworld two world where results are measured,

5
00:00:10.641 --> 00:00:14.960
not in spreadsheets, but in kilos of Coke shifted and rivals murdered.

6
00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:19.160
While you might get someone like Zelda, Blanco born in poverty and Columbia,

7
00:00:20.200 --> 00:00:24.710
Blanco rose from a life of petty crime to become the head of a vast narcotics

8
00:00:24.810 --> 00:00:25.870
empire at a height.

9
00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:29.070
She controlled a distribution network that stretched from the cocoa fields of

10
00:00:29.071 --> 00:00:34.070
Bolivia via the slums of me to all corners of the USA at

11
00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:38.790
a time when Palo Escobar was just some punk as nobody Blanco was the

12
00:00:38.791 --> 00:00:40.030
godmother of cocaine.

13
00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:43.340
<v 1>Yet in this weld, it wasn't enough for a woman to be merely powerful.</v>

14
00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:48.140
She also had to master unbelievable violence implicated in some

15
00:00:48.200 --> 00:00:52.500
250 murders, Blanco almost single handedly helped turn early eighties,

16
00:00:52.501 --> 00:00:53.780
Miami into a war zone,

17
00:00:54.050 --> 00:00:57.620
both a doting mother and a killer without an ounce of mercy in her soul.

18
00:00:57.810 --> 00:01:02.410
This is the life of Griselda Blanco cocaine's most notorious queen pen.

19
00:01:13.930 --> 00:01:17.330
<v 0>Although most of our adult life would be minutely documented in court</v>

20
00:01:17.360 --> 00:01:21.690
transcripts, wire taps and witness statements. Little is known of gr Blanco's.

21
00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:24.520
Early year is born on February the 15th, 1943.

22
00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:28.520
She supposedly held from Columbia's north coast, maybe from Santa Marty,

23
00:01:28.810 --> 00:01:30.000
maybe from kata.

24
00:01:30.400 --> 00:01:33.840
Hania all we know for certain is that a family moved to me E just as Columbia

25
00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:35.840
exploded in 90, 48,

26
00:01:35.841 --> 00:01:39.960
the assassination of a liberal leader in boar spiraled into an undeclared civil

27
00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:44.750
war between the state's two political parties is the era of the Columbia neck

28
00:01:45.070 --> 00:01:45.071
tie.

29
00:01:45.071 --> 00:01:49.230
When members of rival parties would slash their enemies throats and pull their

30
00:01:49.231 --> 00:01:50.430
tongues out of the gash.

31
00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:54.190
An era when entire villages would be hacked to pieces for backing the wrong

32
00:01:54.191 --> 00:01:57.230
politician, it was in short, a time of extreme brutality.

33
00:01:57.390 --> 00:02:01.430
A time when children would often be found mutilated abandoned in playgrounds,

34
00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:05.900
perhaps it's no that those who grew up in this era were the same ones who'd

35
00:02:05.990 --> 00:02:08.500
later become Columbia's violent cartel leaders,

36
00:02:08.690 --> 00:02:12.900
even without Lancia though Zelda would've still had a tough childhood.

37
00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:17.220
The street her family lived on in me was a slum. So rampant with criminality,

38
00:02:17.480 --> 00:02:20.580
the authorities effectively declared it a NoGo zone. As a kid,

39
00:02:21.060 --> 00:02:24.090
Blanko mixed with prostitutes, drug addicts in all manner of deviance.

40
00:02:24.200 --> 00:02:25.033
Many years later,

41
00:02:25.110 --> 00:02:27.850
she would claim she was repeatedly sexually assaulted as a child.

42
00:02:27.990 --> 00:02:30.810
But we can't say for certain, if that's true, no matter how else has she got,

43
00:02:30.811 --> 00:02:35.290
no matter how many people she had murdered Griselda always had a lifelong knack

44
00:02:35.470 --> 00:02:38.290
for making herself seem like the victim. Speaking of murder.

45
00:02:38.291 --> 00:02:41.530
There's a long standing rumor that Blanco committed her first murder before she

46
00:02:41.531 --> 00:02:43.130
was even a teenager, age 11.

47
00:02:43.150 --> 00:02:46.760
She supposedly kidnapped a boy from one of me's wealthier neighborhoods,

48
00:02:46.761 --> 00:02:48.280
writing the family, a ransom note,

49
00:02:48.380 --> 00:02:51.240
unable to believe someone so young could do something so cruel.

50
00:02:51.241 --> 00:02:55.440
The family refused to pay. So Chris Elda took a gun and shot her hostage,

51
00:02:55.450 --> 00:02:59.360
right between the eyes as with so much in the life of the cocaine godmother

52
00:02:59.361 --> 00:03:03.960
though, it's hard to tell where the truth ends and the mythology begins.

53
00:03:04.180 --> 00:03:04.681
For example,

54
00:03:04.681 --> 00:03:08.480
there are other childhood rumors that she used to play with a young Paso from a

55
00:03:08.481 --> 00:03:10.280
tough corner of Meine years later,

56
00:03:10.350 --> 00:03:12.800
that boy would grow up to be N them Pao Escobar.

57
00:03:13.040 --> 00:03:15.280
But whether Blanco really was a preteen killer,

58
00:03:15.420 --> 00:03:19.270
who pals around with the future star of, or not,

59
00:03:19.530 --> 00:03:22.550
her SL upbringing did instill some valuable lessons.

60
00:03:22.810 --> 00:03:26.030
The most valuable of all was that for a girl to survive in this macho world,

61
00:03:26.170 --> 00:03:29.870
she needed to be twice as tough as the toughest boy, as we'll soon.

62
00:03:29.930 --> 00:03:32.790
<v 1>See, it's a message Blanco took to her heart.</v>

63
00:03:33.710 --> 00:03:36.790
Zelda story finally starts to get a bit more solid around the mid 1950s,

64
00:03:36.791 --> 00:03:38.910
having flare her drunk, abusive mother. She,

65
00:03:39.220 --> 00:03:42.140
he eventually met Carlos trio when she was just 13,

66
00:03:42.370 --> 00:03:45.780
much older than Blanco trio was a document forger and people trafficker.

67
00:03:45.940 --> 00:03:49.660
He smuggled hundreds of Colombians to the United States every year ordered by

68
00:03:49.661 --> 00:03:50.040
this man.

69
00:03:50.040 --> 00:03:53.900
<v 0>Blanco became his girlfriend patiently learning how to create fake passports and</v>

70
00:03:53.901 --> 00:03:55.540
identities by 1962,

71
00:03:55.541 --> 00:03:59.340
that had three kids together and established a small criminal network in New

72
00:03:59.340 --> 00:04:02.210
York city. They frequently visited now age 19.

73
00:04:02.730 --> 00:04:06.250
Grael had grown into a friendly flirtatious woman who would only five feet tall

74
00:04:06.251 --> 00:04:10.290
looked almost impossibly sweet and unthreatening, but as we know,

75
00:04:10.540 --> 00:04:13.610
looks can be deceiving by the end of the 1960s.

76
00:04:13.930 --> 00:04:17.850
Karl lost tri suddenly died officially. He was carried off by liver failure,

77
00:04:17.950 --> 00:04:19.970
but not officially. Well, let's just say the,

78
00:04:20.360 --> 00:04:23.200
the reason Blanco would soon pick up her nickname.

79
00:04:23.420 --> 00:04:26.280
One who referred to her relationship with her husband didn't know uncertain

80
00:04:26.330 --> 00:04:28.280
terms. The black widow

81
00:04:34.040 --> 00:04:38.280
Be was trio Coles before Blanco had found a replacement husband like trio

82
00:04:38.470 --> 00:04:42.950
Alberto Bravo was a gang, but while a trio had been a small time, crook,

83
00:04:43.510 --> 00:04:46.590
Bravo had his own network with real estate and me and America.

84
00:04:46.730 --> 00:04:50.550
And it wasn't people. Bravo was interested in smuggling. Rather.

85
00:04:50.570 --> 00:04:52.350
It was cocaine in 1970.

86
00:04:52.420 --> 00:04:55.750
Cocaine was still just finding its feet on America's party scene,

87
00:04:55.770 --> 00:04:58.950
but the prophets were already good in the savvy could see that this was growing

88
00:04:58.951 --> 00:05:03.380
market like a pair of blood venture capitalist it's Blanco and brother would

89
00:05:03.530 --> 00:05:06.900
find themselves perfectly placed to ride the coming boom,

90
00:05:07.560 --> 00:05:11.540
all the way to infa me. The Dawn of the decade found the duo living in Queens,

91
00:05:11.680 --> 00:05:13.580
New York city using trio's old people,

92
00:05:13.581 --> 00:05:17.380
smuggling network Blanco was able to distribute cocaine around the city with

93
00:05:17.381 --> 00:05:19.940
growing ease. At the same time, she was devising ingenious,

94
00:05:19.941 --> 00:05:22.050
new ways of getting blow into America.

95
00:05:22.270 --> 00:05:25.850
One of the most infamous methods involved specially modified bras.

96
00:05:26.170 --> 00:05:28.410
Remember this was before drug smuggling got sophisticated.

97
00:05:28.780 --> 00:05:31.650
Mules would turn up for flights with product strapped to them.

98
00:05:31.651 --> 00:05:34.970
Hopefully nobody noticed the weird bulge under their clothes.

99
00:05:35.210 --> 00:05:39.650
Blanco's genius was to put these bulges out in the open padding bras with half a

100
00:05:39.651 --> 00:05:41.650
kilo of Coke in each cup bras,

101
00:05:41.651 --> 00:05:45.400
she then curvy sexy Colombian women to wear all of whom had been trained to

102
00:05:45.600 --> 00:05:49.600
smell flirtatious at any male customs officials supposedly eyeing their chest.

103
00:05:49.860 --> 00:05:51.920
It was a perversely simple plan.

104
00:05:51.921 --> 00:05:55.520
One that didn't require secret submarines or anything more complex than

105
00:05:55.521 --> 00:05:57.920
manipulating bored and horny males.

106
00:05:58.140 --> 00:06:02.000
Yet it works just as well as anything Barry seal ever cooked up.

107
00:06:02.220 --> 00:06:04.360
So many girls got these bras through customs.

108
00:06:04.361 --> 00:06:07.800
That NYC was soon flooded with white powder in just a couple of years.

109
00:06:07.980 --> 00:06:12.480
Blanco and Bravo had so cornered the markets that even the mafia couldn't

110
00:06:12.481 --> 00:06:15.320
compete at a time when PLO Escobar was still just a low level,

111
00:06:16.320 --> 00:06:20.670
Carlan was turning over 10 million a week in drug profits.

112
00:06:20.970 --> 00:06:23.270
She was also working on building a brand.

113
00:06:23.400 --> 00:06:26.790
Those lessons learned back in the slums about making sure she was tougher than

114
00:06:26.791 --> 00:06:29.110
any man. Well, they were serving her well in New York,

115
00:06:29.710 --> 00:06:32.790
da agents investigating the Southern avalanche of cocaine rolling through

116
00:06:32.820 --> 00:06:34.070
America's biggest city,

117
00:06:34.260 --> 00:06:38.020
encountered a wall of terrified silence from on the questions,

118
00:06:38.160 --> 00:06:39.380
the message on the streets.

119
00:06:39.740 --> 00:06:43.380
The one whispered in dive bars and cocaine fueled nightclubs alike was simple.

120
00:06:43.600 --> 00:06:47.900
<v 1>If you went toe to toe with Grael Delanco you better be prepared for her to chop</v>

121
00:06:47.930 --> 00:06:49.180
your feet off,

122
00:06:49.280 --> 00:06:52.700
but even the strongest wool of silence will have at least a couple of loose

123
00:06:52.880 --> 00:06:54.180
bricks. In the mid seventies,

124
00:06:54.200 --> 00:06:58.690
the da found two former drug meals willing to testify against Lanco operation

125
00:06:58.691 --> 00:07:02.730
banshee was set up to gather evidence and soon 37 indictments were being

126
00:07:03.050 --> 00:07:06.010
prepared, but before the feds could act Grazel Delanco banished.

127
00:07:06.150 --> 00:07:09.330
<v 0>Thanks to all that document forging done with Carlos trio.</v>

128
00:07:09.590 --> 00:07:13.410
Blanco could slip into a new identity as easily as you or I could slip into a

129
00:07:13.680 --> 00:07:17.130
high quality tailored blazer when they got word of the looming indictment,

130
00:07:17.310 --> 00:07:21.280
Blanco and bar simply discarded their New York lives climbed onto planes with

131
00:07:21.281 --> 00:07:23.240
new passports and disappeared back to Columbia.

132
00:07:23.310 --> 00:07:26.880
Unfortunately for the cocaine godmother though, the me of 1975,

133
00:07:26.881 --> 00:07:30.720
wasn't the same as the one she'd left out in the slums and new gangster were

134
00:07:30.721 --> 00:07:33.440
starting to make a name for himself. One. So ruthless,

135
00:07:33.441 --> 00:07:36.480
he Maderis Delanco looked like huckleberry hounds.

136
00:07:36.620 --> 00:07:41.390
His name of course was PLOS Kabar. He was about to make Blanco's life living.

137
00:07:41.660 --> 00:07:42.493
Hell.

138
00:07:47.450 --> 00:07:50.830
If Christel Delanco had hoped that returning home would make her life easier.

139
00:07:50.970 --> 00:07:52.030
She couldn't have been more wrong.

140
00:07:52.390 --> 00:07:56.590
1975 would wind up being an almost embarrassingly bad year for the queen pin.

141
00:07:56.770 --> 00:08:01.340
The trouble started almost soon as she to reclaim the turf Escobar stolen,

142
00:08:01.350 --> 00:08:04.300
being Blanco. She was more than happy to kill her rivals operative,

143
00:08:04.301 --> 00:08:08.140
sticking to the mantra that she needed to be twice as tough as the toughest man,

144
00:08:08.460 --> 00:08:11.780
as even said that she invented murder by Sakari. In this time,

145
00:08:12.020 --> 00:08:14.260
the practice of having a gunman pull up on a motorbike,

146
00:08:14.310 --> 00:08:16.260
shoot someone dead and then go zipping away.

147
00:08:16.400 --> 00:08:19.300
But the trouble was no matter how tough Blanco got.

148
00:08:19.910 --> 00:08:22.370
She always seemed to be playing catch up with Escobar.

149
00:08:22.730 --> 00:08:26.050
Dom PLO was hiring whole teams of Hitman to take out Blanco's people.

150
00:08:26.230 --> 00:08:28.890
At the same time, he was buying up and taking over a drug labs.

151
00:08:29.070 --> 00:08:32.170
And as Blanco began to feel the squeeze and a professional life,

152
00:08:32.370 --> 00:08:33.203
her personal life,

153
00:08:33.450 --> 00:08:36.290
or stick a nasty turn rather than staying me in with his wife,

154
00:08:36.320 --> 00:08:39.970
Alberto barber was spending more and more time in Bo guitar rumors were flying

155
00:08:40.400 --> 00:08:43.920
that he was having an affair that he was planning to ditch Blanco and go solo

156
00:08:43.921 --> 00:08:44.241
things.

157
00:08:44.241 --> 00:08:47.280
Finally came to her head when Blanco discovered her organization was missing

158
00:08:47.281 --> 00:08:50.080
millions of dollars in the parking lot, outside a popular club,

159
00:08:50.100 --> 00:08:52.840
she confronted her husband demanding an explanation. Instead,

160
00:08:53.360 --> 00:08:55.920
Barbara pulled out a newsy, the crackle of gunfire Pierce,

161
00:08:56.060 --> 00:08:59.240
the rainy boo guitar night echoing around the parking lot.

162
00:08:59.430 --> 00:09:01.360
When the noise last died away,

163
00:09:01.460 --> 00:09:05.920
Blanco was still standing clutching a bullet wounds, but still very much alive.

164
00:09:06.220 --> 00:09:08.120
The same could be said of about Beto bra,

165
00:09:08.380 --> 00:09:11.600
the killing of Barbara cemented result's reputation as the black widow.

166
00:09:11.780 --> 00:09:15.670
She returned me in that very night showing not even the faint flicker of remorse

167
00:09:16.070 --> 00:09:19.510
within a year should remarried this time to an associate of the notorious drug

168
00:09:19.511 --> 00:09:23.830
smuggling, AOA brothers trafficker named Dario SEP Vader.

169
00:09:23.900 --> 00:09:28.110
When they finally had a son in 1978, she name him Michael Blanco.

170
00:09:28.120 --> 00:09:32.190
After the main character in the godfather movies in the way this Hollywood

171
00:09:32.191 --> 00:09:35.620
influence was fitting by the end of the 1970s, Blanco would no choice,

172
00:09:35.621 --> 00:09:38.820
but to return to the United States now head of the Medi cartel,

173
00:09:39.220 --> 00:09:41.260
Pablo Escobar effectively taken over a home city.

174
00:09:41.620 --> 00:09:44.260
Everyone who was anyone in the drug business was working for him.

175
00:09:44.650 --> 00:09:47.100
Even Leah OA brothers for the first time,

176
00:09:47.160 --> 00:09:51.180
Blanco had met an opponents tougher and more remorseless than she was.

177
00:09:51.320 --> 00:09:55.420
She could either go on fighting and lose or she could flee Blanco

178
00:09:56.110 --> 00:09:58.610
wisely, chose the latter option. At the end of the decade,

179
00:09:58.670 --> 00:10:00.890
the black widow slipped on her latest disguise,

180
00:10:00.891 --> 00:10:04.930
got on a plane and returned to the us, but she didn't go back to New York.

181
00:10:05.470 --> 00:10:09.130
Oh no. Instead the cocaine godmother had a new destination in mind,

182
00:10:09.290 --> 00:10:12.210
a sun drenched stretch of sea and glittering condos.

183
00:10:12.330 --> 00:10:15.090
There was about to become central to the global drug straight.

184
00:10:15.310 --> 00:10:17.640
She might be a small unthreatening looking woman,

185
00:10:17.641 --> 00:10:19.160
just another passenger on the plane.

186
00:10:19.380 --> 00:10:24.160
But by the time Grazel Delanco was done Miami, would've no idea what had hit it.

187
00:10:29.310 --> 00:10:31.560
When Grazel Delanco touched down in south Florida,

188
00:10:31.700 --> 00:10:33.600
it was at the crest of a vast white wave.

189
00:10:33.840 --> 00:10:37.510
That was about to cascade over America. Here are some quick fix. By 1980,

190
00:10:37.750 --> 00:10:41.350
Columbia was producing a full three quarters of all the cocaine on the planet of

191
00:10:41.351 --> 00:10:43.870
that. Some 70% was traffic through south Florida,

192
00:10:44.060 --> 00:10:47.550
more than 20 billion of product moving into Miami each year.

193
00:10:47.610 --> 00:10:51.550
It was thanks to these astronomical sums that Blanco ends the other NAS,

194
00:10:51.790 --> 00:10:54.750
which soon transform the city almost as soon as she reached the us,

195
00:10:54.770 --> 00:10:58.780
the black widow set about rebuilding her trophy ocean network since Cuban gangs

196
00:10:58.781 --> 00:11:02.420
already controlled Miami streets them in carving out a new niche for herself.

197
00:11:02.440 --> 00:11:06.860
One forged from mayhem murder. Those 250 hits Chris Elrod.

198
00:11:07.500 --> 00:11:11.340
They mostly took place here in the magic city and she wasn't alone in a violent

199
00:11:11.370 --> 00:11:13.380
ways. From 1980 to 1981,

200
00:11:13.381 --> 00:11:17.300
the cartel was gave Miami the highest murder rate of any city in the,

201
00:11:17.810 --> 00:11:20.210
as higher even the me at one point,

202
00:11:20.260 --> 00:11:23.170
there were so many corpses that the city coroner had to store them in a

203
00:11:23.171 --> 00:11:25.930
refrigerated truck that had rented from burger king,

204
00:11:25.990 --> 00:11:27.730
but it wasn't just via street warfare.

205
00:11:27.920 --> 00:11:32.290
That Blanco helped transform Miami with a three sons by trio Dixon,

206
00:11:32.291 --> 00:11:36.370
Uber and AZ Valdo, each handling distribution in a different city.

207
00:11:36.810 --> 00:11:41.640
The cocaine godmother was able to sell over 1,500 kilograms of Charlie sheen

208
00:11:41.890 --> 00:11:44.120
every month. That meant serious money,

209
00:11:44.121 --> 00:11:49.040
money that Blanco needed to launder on a grand scale drug money poured in

210
00:11:49.041 --> 00:11:51.720
from the godmother's pockets into Miami real estate.

211
00:11:51.910 --> 00:11:53.560
Like the other cocaine Cowboys.

212
00:11:53.561 --> 00:11:57.280
She invested so much in legit businesses that it caused an economic boom.

213
00:11:57.500 --> 00:11:59.360
She may have lost her Meine racket,

214
00:11:59.420 --> 00:12:02.880
but the early eighties saw Grazel living in a Florida mentioned so luxurious.

215
00:12:02.881 --> 00:12:05.480
Even Tony Montana would go green with envy.

216
00:12:05.720 --> 00:12:09.760
It was a man watched over by a bust of her own heads that visitors kissed for

217
00:12:09.761 --> 00:12:12.440
good luck. They probably needed it. The richer she got,

218
00:12:12.610 --> 00:12:16.670
the more eager the black widow was to prove that she was still one dangerous

219
00:12:16.671 --> 00:12:19.990
mother in case of her husband Dario Sveta.

220
00:12:20.500 --> 00:12:24.430
This was literal in 1983. Seve got fed up with Blanco,

221
00:12:24.431 --> 00:12:27.670
keeping their son Michael out of school and took the boy back to Mein.

222
00:12:27.930 --> 00:12:29.870
One day he was driving around the city with the boy.

223
00:12:29.871 --> 00:12:34.380
When some cops flagged him down, the moment Seve stops the cops open fire,

224
00:12:34.381 --> 00:12:36.700
decorating the inside of the car with this blood.

225
00:12:36.850 --> 00:12:40.580
They then calmly collected the whaling Michael and flew him back to Miami to be

226
00:12:40.581 --> 00:12:44.460
with his mother yet even having Seve guns down in front of their son.

227
00:12:44.461 --> 00:12:45.940
Wasn't the coldest thing result.

228
00:12:46.120 --> 00:12:49.940
Did she infamously ordered her to the Daylin mall that saw bullets sent flying

229
00:12:49.941 --> 00:12:50.661
into crowds,

230
00:12:50.661 --> 00:12:54.410
killing two and weening two others in another instant industry at the entire

231
00:12:54.411 --> 00:12:56.370
Lorenzo family targeted in a leafy suburb.

232
00:12:56.550 --> 00:12:58.530
Gunman tied up tortured and shot to death.

233
00:12:58.560 --> 00:13:01.730
Both parents while the children watched, but the grimmest of all,

234
00:13:02.020 --> 00:13:05.410
maybe what happened to Johnny Castro a two year old boy,

235
00:13:05.460 --> 00:13:07.050
three years old in some tellings.

236
00:13:07.050 --> 00:13:09.210
Johnny had the bad luck to be in the car with his father.

237
00:13:09.360 --> 00:13:12.690
When one of blancos Hitman pulled up alongside on a motorbike,

238
00:13:12.710 --> 00:13:15.560
the bullets missed the father, but two hit the boy in the skull, killing him.

239
00:13:15.590 --> 00:13:18.320
When she found out about the dead toddler, Blanco was delighted,

240
00:13:18.340 --> 00:13:22.840
noting it made her and Johnny's father. Even as Miami entered the mid 1980s, uh,

241
00:13:23.120 --> 00:13:27.320
Coke filled neon drench, city of vice the cocaine godmother was riding high.

242
00:13:27.460 --> 00:13:30.760
She was now the first female Cardile boss to make over a billion dollars.

243
00:13:31.050 --> 00:13:34.040
She'd cornered the Coke market and was feared by everybody.

244
00:13:34.220 --> 00:13:37.910
But eye and law of gravity is what goes up, must come down.

245
00:13:38.090 --> 00:13:40.030
And when elders fall finally came,

246
00:13:40.330 --> 00:13:43.070
it was going to be even more spectacular than a rise.

247
00:13:48.490 --> 00:13:52.190
So here's the thing about ordering the murders of hundreds of drug traffickers.

248
00:13:52.300 --> 00:13:55.380
Usually those dead traffickers leave behind friends and family.

249
00:13:55.480 --> 00:13:58.780
And usually those friends and family are the sort of people with the guns and

250
00:13:58.980 --> 00:14:01.260
socio theater murder you in return.

251
00:14:01.360 --> 00:14:04.940
That's the situation Graza Delanco found herself in, in 1984,

252
00:14:05.040 --> 00:14:07.660
she was living in a city crawling with super violent people,

253
00:14:07.730 --> 00:14:10.620
just dying to do her some super violence,

254
00:14:10.870 --> 00:14:14.060
which is why after belly half a decade in the sunshine state,

255
00:14:14.080 --> 00:14:17.530
Blanco was abruptly forced to even go into hiding in California.

256
00:14:17.870 --> 00:14:21.890
Yet it wasn't the other cartels that would turn out to be the godmother's

257
00:14:21.891 --> 00:14:25.890
biggest threat. At least not yet. Even as she kept her retention,

258
00:14:26.250 --> 00:14:28.050
laser focused on her fellow drug runners,

259
00:14:28.390 --> 00:14:32.290
far more powerful enemy was starting to stir for the DEA tracking down.

260
00:14:32.390 --> 00:14:36.920
Blanco had become an obsession ever since she skipped town back in 1975 and

261
00:14:36.921 --> 00:14:38.160
through the early 1980s,

262
00:14:38.220 --> 00:14:42.720
as it became clear that Zelda was back in the us agents had pumped

263
00:14:42.721 --> 00:14:47.440
informants laid down wire taps and rated cocaine distribution centers. Finally,

264
00:14:47.500 --> 00:14:51.840
as Blanco resurfaced in California, they'd found someone with an into her,

265
00:14:52.000 --> 00:14:55.800
a former mechanic who'd serviced her three elder sons motorbikes back in Medi

266
00:14:56.220 --> 00:15:00.680
and was now in the us prison for smuggling Coke. Jerry Gomez in 1984,

267
00:15:00.690 --> 00:15:04.200
Gomez met Blanco in an LA hotel under the pretense of helping her LA money.

268
00:15:04.760 --> 00:15:07.000
Although the tight li Zelda didn't say much,

269
00:15:07.060 --> 00:15:11.430
she give away just enough about her trade for the da to start preparing an

270
00:15:11.431 --> 00:15:14.590
arrest warrant. Using a utility bill found during a recent grade,

271
00:15:14.660 --> 00:15:19.110
they attracted to an anonymous California apartment on February the 17th, 1995.

272
00:15:19.111 --> 00:15:23.510
The godmother's log finally ran out that evening. DEA agents burst into fine.

273
00:15:23.910 --> 00:15:26.870
Grazel sat in bed, reading the Bible, a gun on the dresser,

274
00:15:27.210 --> 00:15:30.790
but rather than start shooting, Blanko just stared in disbelief at the,

275
00:15:31.980 --> 00:15:35.980
as he walked up, kiss her on the cheek and declared Chris Elda.

276
00:15:36.440 --> 00:15:40.260
I'm so glad to see you. After a 10 year hunt, it's doubtful.

277
00:15:40.261 --> 00:15:42.660
He was joking in the aftermath of her arrest.

278
00:15:42.780 --> 00:15:44.980
Blanco's three eldest sons were rounded up.

279
00:15:45.220 --> 00:15:48.820
Their distribution network was smashed their cocaine and empire dismantled on

280
00:15:48.980 --> 00:15:50.180
during the 21st, 1985,

281
00:15:50.200 --> 00:15:54.650
the DEA was able to play one of Columbia's first great drug Lords in the dock as

282
00:15:54.690 --> 00:15:59.170
a highly visual warning to all those who'd follow in a path. Two weeks later,

283
00:15:59.230 --> 00:15:59.891
the jury found,

284
00:15:59.891 --> 00:16:03.850
resulted guilty of one count of conspiracy to manufacture important to the

285
00:16:03.851 --> 00:16:07.650
United States and distribute cocaine. The judge sentenced her to 15 years.

286
00:16:07.990 --> 00:16:12.600
It was the end of blancos time as the cocaine queen pin sure should fight on

287
00:16:12.601 --> 00:16:16.880
using legal methods. At first, then once her final appeal was dismissed in 1988,

288
00:16:17.140 --> 00:16:20.760
she switched to illegal ones is around this point that she allegedly dreamed up

289
00:16:20.761 --> 00:16:22.240
a plot to have John F. Kennedy Jr.

290
00:16:22.390 --> 00:16:25.320
Kidnapped and held to ransom into all the government freed her.

291
00:16:25.321 --> 00:16:28.680
But none of it would work. Griselda would never be busted outta prison,

292
00:16:28.681 --> 00:16:30.880
never kidnapped any sons of political families.

293
00:16:31.260 --> 00:16:34.230
But that doesn't mean her story is over. In fact,

294
00:16:34.250 --> 00:16:36.430
the craziest part maybe had to come.

295
00:16:42.030 --> 00:16:45.350
Although Blanco was locked up, the anger that had caused her to flea Miami,

296
00:16:45.450 --> 00:16:48.310
hadn't gone away all over the us and Columbia dozens.

297
00:16:48.311 --> 00:16:50.990
If not hundreds of people were still waiting for their chance to get revenge.

298
00:16:51.290 --> 00:16:53.460
And if they couldn't get to Zelda a why,

299
00:16:53.461 --> 00:16:56.060
they just have to get to those closest to her.

300
00:16:56.200 --> 00:17:00.580
The first to go was O Val Treeo upon his 1992 release from prison.

301
00:17:00.820 --> 00:17:04.540
The godmother's son returned to me only to be shot with a submachine gun at his

302
00:17:04.541 --> 00:17:07.340
own welcome home party, forbidden from flying back for the funeral.

303
00:17:07.600 --> 00:17:10.060
Blanco instead wrote a note, which he demanded the priest,

304
00:17:10.340 --> 00:17:13.500
read out threatening to kill those who'd murdered a boy. It was a threat.

305
00:17:13.770 --> 00:17:14.491
It should follow up on.

306
00:17:14.491 --> 00:17:17.210
When one of her surviving sons Dixon tracked the shooter down.

307
00:17:17.610 --> 00:17:21.330
He tortured him to death and which pleased the distant Zelda yet.

308
00:17:21.330 --> 00:17:23.450
It wouldn't be long before Dixon intern was murdered.

309
00:17:23.560 --> 00:17:26.770
Uber trio followed soon after finally in 1994,

310
00:17:26.771 --> 00:17:31.170
the grim Reba made his first attempt on Banco herself extradited to Miami day to

311
00:17:31.410 --> 00:17:33.250
stand trial for the murders of the Lorenzo family.

312
00:17:33.610 --> 00:17:36.960
And two year or Johnny Castro, Blanco was facing the death penalty.

313
00:17:37.030 --> 00:17:40.760
Prosecutors have managed to turn a former Hitman JGE AALA rents.

314
00:17:40.761 --> 00:17:42.920
His testimony seems certain to send her down,

315
00:17:42.980 --> 00:17:46.320
but then it was discovered that Ayala had been having regular phone sex with two

316
00:17:46.321 --> 00:17:47.880
secretaries from the prosecutor's office.

317
00:17:48.300 --> 00:17:50.840
And the case collapsed desperate to salvage something.

318
00:17:51.320 --> 00:17:53.000
Anything from the humiliating debacle,

319
00:17:53.001 --> 00:17:56.760
prosecutors struck a plea deal with Zelda in return for entering a guilty plea

320
00:17:57.000 --> 00:18:00.640
for the secondary murder she'd received just 20 years, including time served,

321
00:18:00.730 --> 00:18:04.800
which meant that shed walk free in 2004 Blanco took the deal.

322
00:18:05.020 --> 00:18:07.400
And so was that four years into the 21st century.

323
00:18:07.500 --> 00:18:11.870
The woman who'd once the godmother of cocaine left prison behind got on a plane

324
00:18:12.250 --> 00:18:13.990
and flew back to Columbia by now,

325
00:18:13.991 --> 00:18:17.150
her old underworld had changed almost beyond recognition.

326
00:18:17.410 --> 00:18:22.150
Her one time rival PLO Escobar was long dead gunned down on a me rooftop over a

327
00:18:22.151 --> 00:18:25.550
decade before the brothers were either in prison or outta the drug game.

328
00:18:25.690 --> 00:18:27.630
In fact, so many of her enemies were now gone,

329
00:18:27.631 --> 00:18:30.100
that there was no one waiting to greet Zelda with gun.

330
00:18:30.500 --> 00:18:33.660
She stepped off the plane Columbia's years of NACO terror were over.

331
00:18:34.020 --> 00:18:37.540
Although a civil war still raged the country was safer than it had been in

332
00:18:37.541 --> 00:18:38.740
decades in shorts.

333
00:18:38.741 --> 00:18:42.020
It was the perfect environment Forlano to slip into anonymity.

334
00:18:42.120 --> 00:18:45.460
She took an apartment in a complex for the moderately wealthy up in the Meine

335
00:18:45.461 --> 00:18:49.460
Hills. She put on a copious amount of weight, supposedly found religion. The,

336
00:18:49.530 --> 00:18:53.650
and then she settled into a quiet retirement content to no longer be the

337
00:18:53.651 --> 00:18:56.850
godmother of cocaine. Just a safe, secure woman.

338
00:18:56.860 --> 00:19:01.650
Who'd been forgotten by friend and fo alike. Well, so she thought on Monday,

339
00:19:01.970 --> 00:19:03.090
September 30,012,

340
00:19:03.250 --> 00:19:07.170
a motorbike pulled up outside the Caro butcher shop on meins 29th street,

341
00:19:07.370 --> 00:19:08.203
a middle aged man,

342
00:19:08.650 --> 00:19:12.440
calmly got off and walked into the shop where the now 69 year old Zelda was

343
00:19:12.441 --> 00:19:15.040
buying $150 worth of meat, pulling a gun.

344
00:19:15.100 --> 00:19:16.640
The man shot her twice through the head.

345
00:19:16.830 --> 00:19:20.440
Then he got back onto his bike and vanished off into the morning traffic.

346
00:19:20.780 --> 00:19:25.560
It seems there was one enemy somewhere who'd never forgotten the bullet that he

347
00:19:25.640 --> 00:19:29.480
owed Zelda Blanco as the godmother of cocaine died in that midn butchers shop

348
00:19:29.540 --> 00:19:32.230
its tempting to wonder if she looked back over her life.

349
00:19:32.250 --> 00:19:34.870
If she wondered how history would remember her,

350
00:19:34.980 --> 00:19:38.750
certainly her story remains fascinating both for its insight into the drug war

351
00:19:38.990 --> 00:19:42.870
and for its rare depiction of a female cartel leader who made it to the very top

352
00:19:42.871 --> 00:19:45.070
of a Metro world. But really though,

353
00:19:45.140 --> 00:19:47.670
when all this said and done the life of Griselda,

354
00:19:47.730 --> 00:19:50.150
Blanco was nothing special at all.

355
00:19:50.470 --> 00:19:54.460
Tale told full of sound and a fury signifying nothing.

356
00:19:54.960 --> 00:19:58.460
She may have briefly held the world at her feet, but in the end,

357
00:19:58.461 --> 00:20:01.340
the black widow would leave nothing behind to show for it,

358
00:20:01.410 --> 00:20:06.380
nothing but a trail of dead people fittingly it is now her turn to join them.

359
00:20:07.800 --> 00:20:09.820
So I really hope you found that video. Interesting. If you did,
