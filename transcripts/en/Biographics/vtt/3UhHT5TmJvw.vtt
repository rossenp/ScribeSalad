00:00:00.660 --> 00:00:04.350
<v 0>Ah, my name, even in a country, as lousy with artists as France,</v>

2
00:00:04.351 --> 00:00:07.530
he has secured himself a position as one of the grandmasters, a painting,

3
00:00:07.560 --> 00:00:12.120
even if the thicker winds of public rewards were inconsistent in his life.

4
00:00:12.210 --> 00:00:12.690
You may know,

5
00:00:12.690 --> 00:00:16.380
known as the dude who painted Meadows and skylines in unexpected colors,

6
00:00:16.410 --> 00:00:18.720
but to millions of adoring museum goers,

7
00:00:18.750 --> 00:00:21.990
he is a bigger rock star now than at any point in his life.

8
00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:23.250
And just like a rock star,

9
00:00:23.280 --> 00:00:26.910
his name can be found on every these of merchandise imaginable, jewelry ties,

10
00:00:26.911 --> 00:00:30.690
scarves apron, stuffed frogs finger puppets, children's books, Prince pop-up,

11
00:00:30.691 --> 00:00:31.524
garden models.

12
00:00:31.680 --> 00:00:36.300
Even the occasional hand painted reproduction experts in the know agree.

13
00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:41.430
Monet is money 2019 saw a new all-time record for

14
00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:46.020
most expensive money ever sold $110 million for a version of haystacks,

15
00:00:46.021 --> 00:00:49.470
which had been held in private ownerships and just completion in the art

16
00:00:49.471 --> 00:00:53.100
collecting world pieces by a Monet are extremely popular because of their ever

17
00:00:53.101 --> 00:00:56.430
appreciating value and the frequency with which they show up at auction is

18
00:00:56.431 --> 00:00:59.250
reported to have painted over 2000 canvases in his life.

19
00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:03.810
Often working on multiple iterations of the same subject simultaneously to best

20
00:01:03.811 --> 00:01:08.010
capture specific moments of light and color because the work is so consistent,

21
00:01:08.190 --> 00:01:11.910
it becomes easier for appraisers to value paintings by comparing them to the

22
00:01:11.911 --> 00:01:16.140
sale of prices of works from the same set. Also Manet's paintings are gorgeous.

23
00:01:16.141 --> 00:01:18.120
Now we say that about every artist we feature,

24
00:01:18.121 --> 00:01:22.620
but Manet more than most knew how to convey emotion through the raw medium of

25
00:01:22.621 --> 00:01:23.100
color,

26
00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:27.600
how to play light against itself in a ballet of feeling Monet is the strongest

27
00:01:27.601 --> 00:01:29.220
arguments against photo realism.

28
00:01:29.221 --> 00:01:32.970
Art that can be made the idea that a painting can depict de subjective

29
00:01:32.971 --> 00:01:37.710
impression over a concrete reality was such a fundamental rejection of the

30
00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:40.590
autistic trends of the era. That's even the label.

31
00:01:40.591 --> 00:01:42.960
Impressionism was first intended as a critique.

32
00:01:43.050 --> 00:01:45.030
The paintings were considered incomplete,

33
00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:48.360
rudimentary sketches of scenes rather than the fully realized some.

34
00:01:48.510 --> 00:01:51.450
She was visual feasts that they are beneath the gardens,

35
00:01:51.451 --> 00:01:53.520
the pastorial picnic ready Meadows,

36
00:01:53.521 --> 00:01:57.930
the cultivated capitalistic Steria beat the hot of an unstoppable

37
00:01:57.931 --> 00:01:59.220
revolutionary Medan.

38
00:01:59.221 --> 00:02:02.610
His contemporaries represented such a vast departure from the artistic

39
00:02:02.611 --> 00:02:05.820
establishment that 20 temporary relocated to the Netherlands.

40
00:02:05.821 --> 00:02:09.270
The police secretly investigated them for political sedition,

41
00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:12.180
the bad and painted landscapes. It's someone confused them.

42
00:02:12.181 --> 00:02:15.480
The maps credit goes to the indispensable book wizards at the university of

43
00:02:15.481 --> 00:02:17.520
Massachusetts Amherst libraries collection,

44
00:02:17.521 --> 00:02:21.540
who succeeded in tracking down copies and translations of the actual

45
00:02:21.541 --> 00:02:25.380
surveillance nodes kept by the police today may well be the first time they're

46
00:02:25.590 --> 00:02:27.060
ever seen on YouTube. So I believe him.

47
00:02:27.150 --> 00:02:29.580
And I tell you that this is a bit of a special episode.

48
00:02:41.630 --> 00:02:43.040
Everyone is born a genius.

49
00:02:43.041 --> 00:02:46.730
It's what we do with the intervening years that decides if we get to keep the

50
00:02:46.731 --> 00:02:51.230
title Monet's genius. First blessed Paris on the 14th of November,

51
00:02:51.230 --> 00:02:52.790
1840 son of a merchant and singer,

52
00:02:52.791 --> 00:02:56.270
it was assumed young Oscar would follow his father into the families' ship

53
00:02:56.300 --> 00:02:57.350
channeling business.

54
00:02:57.380 --> 00:03:02.050
Fortunately for us art quick primer and obscure Naval trivialities

55
00:03:02.140 --> 00:03:05.680
Chandler is basically a petrol station, but for sailboats,

56
00:03:05.710 --> 00:03:08.140
fewer gummy worms and dodgy meat pies,

57
00:03:08.141 --> 00:03:12.100
more whale grease and hook hands it's far from glamorous walk.

58
00:03:12.130 --> 00:03:15.910
Most of your clients being Cutlass wielding, weevil, eating privateers,

59
00:03:17.080 --> 00:03:19.780
but will buy enough needlessly long breads to feed a family.

60
00:03:19.930 --> 00:03:23.620
Anyone born into that kind of guaranteed comfort cause count themselves pretty

61
00:03:23.621 --> 00:03:27.610
lucky in the 18 hundreds. So of course, Monet pursued art with his mind,

62
00:03:27.730 --> 00:03:29.800
body and soul. At the age of 11,

63
00:03:29.830 --> 00:03:32.500
he had already established himself as a caricature artist.

64
00:03:32.710 --> 00:03:34.210
After his family moved to Normandy,

65
00:03:34.211 --> 00:03:37.960
he would sit in the town square with a stack of papers and some charcoal and

66
00:03:37.961 --> 00:03:42.100
sell sketches for 10 to 20 Franks Paul at the age of again,

67
00:03:42.340 --> 00:03:43.360
11 as a mother,

68
00:03:43.361 --> 00:03:46.690
I believed in her son unconditionally as brothers all want to do,

69
00:03:46.691 --> 00:03:49.580
but she died when he was barely 16, rather than bachelor.

70
00:03:49.750 --> 00:03:51.490
During his up with his blubber Munger of a father,

71
00:03:51.520 --> 00:03:53.560
he went to live with his Chandler's widowed aunt.

72
00:03:53.920 --> 00:03:55.990
It'd be easy to make jokes about her as a veil cloud,

73
00:03:56.400 --> 00:04:00.910
Mona's wanting through a dusty gray garden style estate or a Whalebone corset,

74
00:04:00.911 --> 00:04:03.610
a Dickensian governance, but in all seriousness though,

75
00:04:03.611 --> 00:04:05.830
name may owe his life to Maria.

76
00:04:13.620 --> 00:04:16.310
It makes you 61. Monet was drafted into service. We as chefs,

77
00:04:16.311 --> 00:04:19.680
sewer to our free cavalry group comprised of equal parts,

78
00:04:19.681 --> 00:04:23.280
French youth and locally recruited North African soldiers, fun fact,

79
00:04:23.490 --> 00:04:24.420
six years before it was drafting,

80
00:04:24.421 --> 00:04:27.480
they were involved in the famously failed charge of the light brigade,

81
00:04:27.481 --> 00:04:29.970
which we'll probably talk about in a future video.

82
00:04:30.150 --> 00:04:34.980
Let's pretend you're a wealthy Lund elder of the channeling community that

83
00:04:34.981 --> 00:04:37.110
sweat of your brow has purchased your family,

84
00:04:37.120 --> 00:04:38.970
a comfortable life in an upcoming city.

85
00:04:39.090 --> 00:04:43.500
Your only son is looking at a 70th stints of getting shot out in a desert that

86
00:04:43.501 --> 00:04:44.070
hates them.

87
00:04:44.070 --> 00:04:46.980
So naturally you'll use some of your hard earned money to buy his freedom,

88
00:04:47.040 --> 00:04:50.610
right? Well, congratulations. You're a better father than Manet hat puppet.

89
00:04:50.611 --> 00:04:54.510
Claude refused to spare his son from military service because his son would not

90
00:04:54.511 --> 00:04:56.910
renounce art in favor of ship genre.

91
00:04:57.060 --> 00:05:01.440
It's like very PESI imagine seeing your child you off almost exclusively for the

92
00:05:01.441 --> 00:05:02.490
entirety of their lives,

93
00:05:02.500 --> 00:05:05.970
then refusing to spare them from an almost decade long sentence.

94
00:05:06.030 --> 00:05:10.140
Even in the extremely crowded field of terrible fathers of influential artists,

95
00:05:10.170 --> 00:05:13.710
clawed at all for Monet manages to stand out.

96
00:05:13.770 --> 00:05:17.490
Thankfully geniuses never quaters during the occupation,

97
00:05:17.640 --> 00:05:20.760
his skills did not go unnoticed after sketching some desert landscapes in a

98
00:05:20.761 --> 00:05:24.630
bustling marketplace, Tableau, he was approached to do portraits of officers.

99
00:05:24.660 --> 00:05:27.780
Sadly, none of these works survived to the modern age, but it's evidence.

100
00:05:27.810 --> 00:05:29.730
How much of an impact traveling to Algeria?

101
00:05:29.731 --> 00:05:34.080
Hands on his appreciation for striking visuals. Here is a biome.

102
00:05:34.081 --> 00:05:38.280
Unlike anything France could ever produce sprawling deserts and glittering oases

103
00:05:38.281 --> 00:05:42.540
with bazaars. We'll have people in totally new styles and colors of dress,

104
00:05:42.570 --> 00:05:46.230
the food, the elaborate North African mosaic, tall work. He himself,

105
00:05:46.260 --> 00:05:47.130
even at message. This,

106
00:05:47.310 --> 00:05:51.990
all of this contains the gem of my future research is in color and form.

107
00:05:52.080 --> 00:05:54.000
However, after two years in cramps,

108
00:05:54.001 --> 00:05:58.520
Garrison Monet got down with that notorious typhoid fever.

109
00:05:58.640 --> 00:06:00.080
For those of you, who've never read Dickens.

110
00:06:00.081 --> 00:06:02.990
Typhoid can only be spread by consuming the feces or blood,

111
00:06:03.020 --> 00:06:06.140
or they gross monster who didn't wash their hands. Good thing,

112
00:06:06.141 --> 00:06:08.240
nothing like that happens in modern times.

113
00:06:08.570 --> 00:06:11.540
Monet always died because someone didn't wash their hands at some point between

114
00:06:11.541 --> 00:06:15.080
using the bathroom and cooking dinner or that kids don't be the person who

115
00:06:15.081 --> 00:06:17.990
almost killed Manet, wash your filthy hands.

116
00:06:18.020 --> 00:06:21.860
Thankfully rather than let them slowly die on a cart. His arms Murray John,

117
00:06:21.861 --> 00:06:22.820
let God repetition.

118
00:06:22.821 --> 00:06:26.000
The government do release him early in exchange for attending art lessons,

119
00:06:26.210 --> 00:06:28.220
art school or military services, eight questions.

120
00:06:28.340 --> 00:06:30.860
So obvious and straightforward, not even a parliamentarian,

121
00:06:30.861 --> 00:06:34.570
good weasel their way out of the direct answers. So he graciously accepted.

122
00:06:41.680 --> 00:06:42.520
So let this shock you,

123
00:06:42.521 --> 00:06:46.180
but on occasion artists and their models have affairs Camille's you don't see

124
00:06:46.270 --> 00:06:49.720
it. I got to live out that ultimate romance and a little fantasy muse wife to a

125
00:06:49.721 --> 00:06:52.990
misunderstood genius, who parishes at a tragically beautiful age.

126
00:06:53.110 --> 00:06:56.740
She was the model for many of his early works, including women in a green dress.

127
00:06:56.770 --> 00:07:00.490
One of the first pieces do you hang in the famous Alonda Perry in the Japanese

128
00:07:00.491 --> 00:07:04.480
she's portrayed as a blonde in a brilliant red kimono holding a fan.

129
00:07:04.660 --> 00:07:08.110
This was a Santa Rona, Zen contemporary obsession with Japanese art.

130
00:07:08.170 --> 00:07:11.440
And what will surely come as a surprise Camille's parents did not approve of the

131
00:07:11.441 --> 00:07:14.950
courtroom marriage between the 20 five-year-old penniless artist and their 18

132
00:07:14.951 --> 00:07:17.200
year old daughter. When they had that first child,

133
00:07:17.201 --> 00:07:20.890
her parents disowned her though Monet had a few gallery showings money was hard

134
00:07:20.891 --> 00:07:24.220
to come by and he wants to destroy it a canvas rather than let it be seized

135
00:07:24.360 --> 00:07:26.410
about creditors in 1870 war in France,

136
00:07:26.680 --> 00:07:29.740
drive money to England where he exhibited his work a few times to modest

137
00:07:29.741 --> 00:07:31.390
commercial success. With these funds,

138
00:07:31.391 --> 00:07:35.290
he was able to relocate his family to Zan dam Holland in early 1871.

139
00:07:35.291 --> 00:07:38.680
The same year that the radical socialist experiments of the Paris commune was

140
00:07:38.890 --> 00:07:40.750
crushed by French government forces.

141
00:07:41.000 --> 00:07:43.750
They wrote in letters that he was fleeing France out of belief,

142
00:07:43.751 --> 00:07:45.040
that one of his best friends,

143
00:07:45.041 --> 00:07:48.130
they witnessed that his wedding had been shot without trial. In reality,

144
00:07:48.131 --> 00:07:51.250
the man was dried and sentenced to six months in prison, but either way,

145
00:07:51.430 --> 00:07:54.850
any French national traveling abroad was considered a potential political

146
00:07:54.851 --> 00:07:58.660
refugee seen her if photocopies copies of the actual telegram reports,

147
00:07:58.661 --> 00:08:01.270
the police sent to the Dutch government, the fairly brief,

148
00:08:01.300 --> 00:08:04.810
because it turns out the money wasn't a secret radical socialist sent to

149
00:08:04.811 --> 00:08:06.160
undermine Dutch society.

150
00:08:06.460 --> 00:08:09.070
It was a painter and he spent most of his time painting.

151
00:08:09.100 --> 00:08:12.250
One of the reasons Dutch authorities knew to expect him coming was due to the

152
00:08:12.251 --> 00:08:15.070
media reputation. Monet had thus far cultivated.

153
00:08:15.250 --> 00:08:18.520
He would be interviewed while painting storms or standing on the edge of

154
00:08:18.521 --> 00:08:21.730
perilous cliffs. This would pay off years later in 1874,

155
00:08:21.731 --> 00:08:26.230
when Monet and Renoir and the other impressionists held an unjudged gallery

156
00:08:26.231 --> 00:08:29.530
exhibition in protest of the stuffy Salone to Perry.

157
00:08:29.770 --> 00:08:32.740
Anyone could come off the streets and check out the new style,

158
00:08:32.741 --> 00:08:37.150
including the infamous impression, sunrise, the work whose disparagement in spa,

159
00:08:37.180 --> 00:08:40.600
the name impressionism in the first place. But we're getting out of ourselves

160
00:08:47.470 --> 00:08:51.220
Regarding to parents in 1872 poverty compelled them to move frequently and they

161
00:08:51.221 --> 00:08:53.650
would come to share a house with his former patrons,

162
00:08:53.680 --> 00:08:56.130
Alison and his hot-seat also broke. Earnest,

163
00:08:56.131 --> 00:08:58.980
stayed close to the city for work while Alice lived with them. And A's,

164
00:08:59.010 --> 00:09:00.240
there were eight children in that house.

165
00:09:00.270 --> 00:09:03.060
Even with two women doing all the housework, the economics were grim.

166
00:09:03.090 --> 00:09:04.680
The situation went from bat to West.

167
00:09:04.681 --> 00:09:09.120
Once Camille's health started to fail and 1876 afflicted with both tuberculosis

168
00:09:09.121 --> 00:09:12.480
and uterine cancer. She died slowly over a period of years.

169
00:09:12.570 --> 00:09:15.840
And I find a moment as Monet painted. One of his most controversial works.

170
00:09:16.500 --> 00:09:18.300
Camille Monet upon her death bed.

171
00:09:18.480 --> 00:09:21.930
The work itself is certainly a fitting tribute to the woman who had given my

172
00:09:22.160 --> 00:09:26.310
niece so much only a faces visible over the bed sheets, but the whole figure,

173
00:09:26.370 --> 00:09:29.220
it seems to be enveloped in this gentle gradient, like a veil,

174
00:09:29.280 --> 00:09:32.070
the arch of the bed over her recalls the image of an Angel's wings.

175
00:09:32.070 --> 00:09:35.910
The texture of the face draws the eye to the creases where her arms seem to be

176
00:09:35.911 --> 00:09:37.830
folded over a chest, almost like a mummy.

177
00:09:38.190 --> 00:09:41.310
The priest who administered her last rights also sanctioned the marriage between

178
00:09:41.311 --> 00:09:41.881
them blessing.

179
00:09:41.881 --> 00:09:45.570
What had started out as a simple civil ceremony those few years ago,

180
00:09:45.660 --> 00:09:48.600
despite having just lost his wife and he did not stay single long.

181
00:09:48.601 --> 00:09:50.130
He and Alice grew closer.

182
00:09:50.160 --> 00:09:54.450
This rampant speculation that their affair started as soon as KML fell ill and

183
00:09:54.630 --> 00:09:58.020
the press made sport of this even going so low as to mock the hardworking

184
00:09:58.021 --> 00:09:59.610
owners, to continue to hustle,

185
00:09:59.611 --> 00:10:02.940
to support the household while staying in Claude soul studio in Paris.

186
00:10:03.180 --> 00:10:06.240
Imagine living that life, imagine financially supporting an artist,

187
00:10:06.270 --> 00:10:07.440
letting him raise your children.

188
00:10:07.441 --> 00:10:10.110
And while you try and restore your family's fortune and good name,

189
00:10:10.320 --> 00:10:13.830
only for them to turn around and romance your wife while his own dime

190
00:10:21.230 --> 00:10:23.990
Camille's death would see Monet hone his multiple canvas techniques,

191
00:10:23.991 --> 00:10:27.140
switching to a new one every seven minutes while waiting for the panes on one

192
00:10:27.141 --> 00:10:31.370
canvas to dry, he would immediately start work on another often up to 10 or 20.

193
00:10:31.371 --> 00:10:32.060
At one time,

194
00:10:32.060 --> 00:10:35.810
he is rumored to have once grown so overwhelmed by the scale he was working on

195
00:10:35.930 --> 00:10:39.440
this. He pitched everything into a river only to fish it out moments later.

196
00:10:39.590 --> 00:10:42.830
So let's talk about what made his work so different. Back then,

197
00:10:42.831 --> 00:10:45.950
painting was a messy space and labor intensive process.

198
00:10:46.020 --> 00:10:50.150
Artists would stretch their own canvases and make their own paints by grinding

199
00:10:50.151 --> 00:10:52.310
pigments, into powders and mixing them with oils.

200
00:10:52.311 --> 00:10:56.150
Things that much easier to do in a studio rather than on a hillside 10 miles

201
00:10:56.151 --> 00:10:59.330
away because they were painting models in a controlled environment.

202
00:10:59.331 --> 00:11:00.021
So lots of arts,

203
00:11:00.021 --> 00:11:04.250
contemporary to Monet feel staged and artificial Brock near classical work

204
00:11:04.251 --> 00:11:07.520
steeped in Greco. Roman mythology was what the art buying public wants.

205
00:11:07.521 --> 00:11:10.610
It extremely nude gods wrapped in floating sheets.

206
00:11:10.640 --> 00:11:14.870
That's what art was to the young Monet naked babies flying around the loop

207
00:11:14.900 --> 00:11:17.210
ceiling. In case you thought I was kidding.

208
00:11:17.211 --> 00:11:21.530
Apollo slaves plays them by Eugene Delacroix represents the absolute epitome of

209
00:11:21.531 --> 00:11:23.840
what critics expected of artists at the time,

210
00:11:23.960 --> 00:11:27.530
technically precise photo realistic depictions of mythological struggles.

211
00:11:27.560 --> 00:11:30.440
This particular work was commissioned by Louis the 14th.

212
00:11:30.441 --> 00:11:34.310
And it depicts a scene from overdose work metamorphosis where the God Apollo

213
00:11:34.700 --> 00:11:37.310
wrestles some snaky fines. The work is rich and metaphors.

214
00:11:37.311 --> 00:11:39.920
You can see everything on the bottom of the painting is dark and evil.

215
00:11:39.921 --> 00:11:43.430
Looking while everything at the top is shiny and bright, very subtle,

216
00:11:43.431 --> 00:11:47.180
the perfect subject to pontificate on while holding a snifter of Brandy.

217
00:11:47.690 --> 00:11:50.900
Why is it important putting aside the fact that it's a palace ceiling,

218
00:11:50.930 --> 00:11:53.590
the months and years of constant perpetual toil?

219
00:11:53.710 --> 00:11:55.690
What impression does this painting leave on you?

220
00:11:55.840 --> 00:11:59.410
Where does that feeling come from? Does it come from the high quality inks,

221
00:11:59.411 --> 00:12:02.470
the hours the model spent posing for reference sketches,

222
00:12:02.471 --> 00:12:04.750
all the assistants scurrying around Della CRA,

223
00:12:05.170 --> 00:12:07.330
who gets to decide that this matters.

224
00:12:13.680 --> 00:12:14.130
<v 1>[Inaudible].</v>

225
00:12:14.130 --> 00:12:17.640
<v 0>I think out of the studio realizing the inability of the imagination to grasp</v>

226
00:12:17.641 --> 00:12:20.970
the intricacies of nature was made much easier by a number of technical

227
00:12:20.971 --> 00:12:25.060
developments, including the collapsible easel lends the shade box,

228
00:12:25.190 --> 00:12:27.810
portable container for both paints and small canvases.

229
00:12:27.990 --> 00:12:32.250
Suddenly anyone could step out into the light and dash off wax of natural genius

230
00:12:32.251 --> 00:12:36.630
without needing a small retainer of handmaidens do tote your bags for you shall

231
00:12:36.631 --> 00:12:39.600
Francois [inaudible] invented a fully stocked floating studio,

232
00:12:39.610 --> 00:12:42.000
so he could easily drift down the sin and paint.

233
00:12:42.001 --> 00:12:46.080
The shoreline effortlessly dashing off masterpiece often lost a piece because it

234
00:12:46.081 --> 00:12:48.570
was suddenly accessible and almost democratized to a point.

235
00:12:48.571 --> 00:12:52.130
This led to an explosion in this style of art. And it was this absolute fever,

236
00:12:52.140 --> 00:12:54.600
the natural world that my niece stepped into as a young artist,

237
00:13:01.950 --> 00:13:06.210
Bo Allah granary, Leah from 1869, a scene based on a floating restaurant,

238
00:13:06.211 --> 00:13:08.670
which fellow impressionist Renoir also pains.

239
00:13:08.671 --> 00:13:12.900
It it's a bigger group of Baders resting on a small Island next to a restaurant.

240
00:13:13.210 --> 00:13:16.260
Everything surrounded by water rather than being just some plastic mirror.

241
00:13:16.261 --> 00:13:18.600
The river itself is an active participant in the scene.

242
00:13:18.810 --> 00:13:22.710
Instead of trying to recreate the exact images in the water may intersperse is

243
00:13:22.711 --> 00:13:26.460
the same color of the foliage above with the blue of the water to create the

244
00:13:26.461 --> 00:13:27.690
illusion of ripples here,

245
00:13:27.691 --> 00:13:30.300
the bands denote both the surface and capacity of the water.

246
00:13:30.360 --> 00:13:31.200
If you look close enough,

247
00:13:31.201 --> 00:13:35.340
you can see the zigzags of Connor gradually breaking into secular Tonya spots,

248
00:13:35.370 --> 00:13:37.890
not exactly a recreation of the surface of the water,

249
00:13:37.891 --> 00:13:40.140
but it's an approximation of what it feels like.

250
00:13:40.200 --> 00:13:43.530
We are invited to fill in the visual imperfections with our own emotional

251
00:13:43.531 --> 00:13:44.610
reactions to the piece.

252
00:13:44.700 --> 00:13:47.880
Take a look at how we use those colors to give the impression of shadow.

253
00:13:47.970 --> 00:13:51.000
We know that this crowd is seated in the shade because of the contrast of the

254
00:13:51.001 --> 00:13:52.290
brighter foliage behind them.

255
00:13:52.320 --> 00:13:54.810
The line makes it look yellow while the closer leaves are a deep green,

256
00:13:54.990 --> 00:13:58.680
the motion of the water throws back more light than the sky above it.

257
00:13:58.830 --> 00:14:02.940
You seem trees wave in the wind before you instinctively know how to read those

258
00:14:03.000 --> 00:14:07.380
blobs of painters tree. This here's where Monet really earns his accolades.

259
00:14:07.410 --> 00:14:11.160
Trace the reflection of the tree in the water below the trunk waivers it's even

260
00:14:11.280 --> 00:14:14.190
doubled against the leopard spot waves. We looked at earlier.

261
00:14:14.250 --> 00:14:18.420
The canopy is reduced to dark green echoed the same lopsided circular pattern,

262
00:14:18.421 --> 00:14:20.310
which becomes the spot since exacts.

263
00:14:20.460 --> 00:14:24.420
This great diversity of brush strokes was something he encouraged other artists

264
00:14:24.421 --> 00:14:25.920
to incorporate into their work.

265
00:14:26.100 --> 00:14:29.820
You can almost imagine what this place sounds like heavy with the murmur of

266
00:14:29.821 --> 00:14:30.631
conversation,

267
00:14:30.631 --> 00:14:35.370
the splash of bathers and the clink of dishwasher balancing each other out the

268
00:14:35.550 --> 00:14:38.130
late afternoon sun playing off the bushes on the distant shore.

269
00:14:38.131 --> 00:14:42.000
The heat of the day now broken as friends recount the weekends adventures.

270
00:14:42.240 --> 00:14:46.320
So now you see what a huge change this was from Della cross snake wrangling.

271
00:14:46.350 --> 00:14:50.640
You can understand how brave Manet had to be in order to try and compete against

272
00:14:50.641 --> 00:14:54.140
neoclassical. It looks incomplete. The brush strokes prominence,

273
00:14:54.290 --> 00:14:55.970
and there's an overwhelming vagueness to it.

274
00:14:55.971 --> 00:14:59.330
All neoclassical work feels impressive because this degree of precision requires

275
00:14:59.331 --> 00:15:01.160
expensive tools and decades of training.

276
00:15:01.190 --> 00:15:04.730
It's the visual equivalent to a palace and expression of wealth and mastery

277
00:15:04.910 --> 00:15:09.050
impressionism rejects that impressionism tells us that our work matters because

278
00:15:09.051 --> 00:15:13.370
it speaks to us and how we see the world, the institution doesn't get to decide.

279
00:15:13.371 --> 00:15:14.204
What's beautiful.

280
00:15:14.240 --> 00:15:17.950
We do this kind of rebellious streak resonated with the democracy, hungry French

281
00:15:25.150 --> 00:15:27.760
Genes, changing money, had the resources to rent and then buy the home,

282
00:15:27.761 --> 00:15:31.150
which would eventually become his world famous residence. By the mid 1890s,

283
00:15:31.151 --> 00:15:34.810
he had converted a humble farmhouse into a cutting edge of state's complete its

284
00:15:34.840 --> 00:15:36.490
greenhouse and skylight studio.

285
00:15:36.640 --> 00:15:40.420
He hired seven gardeners now up in manage his two and a half acre garden issuing

286
00:15:40.421 --> 00:15:43.480
daily instructions for the husbanding of his precious in any pads.

287
00:15:43.540 --> 00:15:47.080
He wins to no small expense to import every color and variety of Lily pad that

288
00:15:47.081 --> 00:15:51.100
he learns about encouraging them to create hybrid blossoms and rainbows of

289
00:15:51.580 --> 00:15:54.400
Hugh's blue, yellow pinks that aged into a deep red.

290
00:15:54.430 --> 00:15:57.880
He would have his gardeners over Windsor, the fragile tropical cultivars,

291
00:15:57.881 --> 00:16:01.660
and especially like greenhouses, then replant them in his pond every spring.

292
00:16:01.840 --> 00:16:05.380
So great. It was Monet's love of water lilies that you can trace a change.

293
00:16:05.381 --> 00:16:07.720
In his perspective, when he first arrived at Shivani,

294
00:16:07.780 --> 00:16:12.040
he would fix the horizon on his Japanese footbridge. But over time,

295
00:16:12.041 --> 00:16:16.150
the gaze drops lower and lower until the only thing on the canvas is water and

296
00:16:16.360 --> 00:16:18.250
Lily pads here he is in 1899,

297
00:16:18.550 --> 00:16:22.240
mating 12 versions of Japanese footbridge fast-forward to 1916.

298
00:16:22.241 --> 00:16:26.020
He started focusing on the shoreline areas with one of his weeping willows

299
00:16:26.050 --> 00:16:30.670
printed out of concern for his son and countrymen fighting in world war one by

300
00:16:30.671 --> 00:16:32.440
1919, he's all but abandoned.

301
00:16:32.441 --> 00:16:36.550
The sky is nothing more than a blue contrast on upon the surface.

302
00:16:36.640 --> 00:16:40.540
This is contemplative peace heavy with the burden of thoughts. At this point,

303
00:16:40.570 --> 00:16:43.450
he had outlived both his eldest child, gene and his wife, Alice,

304
00:16:43.451 --> 00:16:45.940
who passed away in 1914 and 1911,

305
00:16:45.941 --> 00:16:49.540
respectively Alice's daughter blondish took over much of the day-to-day

306
00:16:49.541 --> 00:16:52.990
management of the estate, inheriting that duty from her late husband, Jean,

307
00:16:53.020 --> 00:16:55.840
if you're always in, out by the idea of step siblings getting married,

308
00:16:55.841 --> 00:16:59.560
no Manet broke up a prior engagement between blush and one of his other

309
00:16:59.561 --> 00:17:00.770
students. So that's.

310
00:17:07.570 --> 00:17:07.810
<v 3>[Inaudible].</v>

311
00:17:07.810 --> 00:17:10.000
<v 0>As if he didn't have enough going wrong in his life.</v>

312
00:17:10.001 --> 00:17:13.660
It's during the same time that he begins at about cataracts through the mid 19

313
00:17:13.661 --> 00:17:16.690
teens, up until he had corrective surgery in 1923,

314
00:17:16.840 --> 00:17:19.360
his work began to develop a reddish Milky hue.

315
00:17:19.540 --> 00:17:20.950
He responded by having his assistants,

316
00:17:20.951 --> 00:17:24.820
prepare his colors for him rather than trusting his own perception for one who

317
00:17:24.821 --> 00:17:25.391
loved color.

318
00:17:25.391 --> 00:17:28.810
We can also imagine the immense psychological toll this must have had just

319
00:17:28.811 --> 00:17:32.770
compared this example from 1907 to the rendition of his footbridge in 1920,

320
00:17:32.950 --> 00:17:36.490
you can barely even make out the bridge. It's just a dock cage of red,

321
00:17:36.640 --> 00:17:38.350
around a rock of red foliage.

322
00:17:38.380 --> 00:17:40.960
Contrast that to these lilies that he finished in 1926.

323
00:17:40.961 --> 00:17:43.870
And you can see the blues and greens returned to the forefront of his work.

324
00:17:43.970 --> 00:17:45.310
There's a fair bit of scholarly study,

325
00:17:45.311 --> 00:17:47.650
which suggests the operation likely gave Monet.

326
00:17:47.651 --> 00:17:51.240
The ability to perceive ultraviolet light is a white blue globe.

327
00:17:51.270 --> 00:17:54.750
People want to believe the great superhuman that is specialized side was what

328
00:17:54.751 --> 00:17:56.070
allowed him to paint like you did.

329
00:17:56.280 --> 00:17:59.820
But this has happened three years before his death of lung cancer on a list of

330
00:18:00.000 --> 00:18:03.150
things that enables genius to flourish. Specialized rank far,

331
00:18:03.151 --> 00:18:06.720
far below a partner who manages your domestic affairs for you.

332
00:18:13.850 --> 00:18:13.970
<v 3>[Inaudible].</v>

333
00:18:13.970 --> 00:18:15.860
<v 0>Of women who sacrifice themselves in Monet.</v>

334
00:18:15.861 --> 00:18:20.450
We would be remiss not to mention the artistic talents of blanche Horshack Manet

335
00:18:20.540 --> 00:18:23.900
as mentioned, the Porsche is where frequent patrons of my name,

336
00:18:23.901 --> 00:18:27.590
meaning the blush has ready, grown up in an impressionist environments.

337
00:18:27.591 --> 00:18:30.020
By the time I took her under his wing. In fact,

338
00:18:30.080 --> 00:18:33.680
she also had started painting at the age of 11 and immediately took to the

339
00:18:33.681 --> 00:18:34.700
impressionist style,

340
00:18:34.850 --> 00:18:37.940
the two work so closely together on some pieces that it can be difficult for

341
00:18:37.941 --> 00:18:39.980
experts to discern which hand created,

342
00:18:39.981 --> 00:18:43.580
which work just combat her version of haystacks with a similar one.

343
00:18:43.581 --> 00:18:46.550
From that series that sold at auction for all the money in the world,

344
00:18:46.700 --> 00:18:50.180
sadly managing the family estate took up so much time that she stopped painting

345
00:18:50.181 --> 00:18:51.260
for about 30 years.

346
00:18:51.500 --> 00:18:54.800
She enabled money to focus totally on working through the last decades of his

347
00:18:54.801 --> 00:18:55.220
life.

348
00:18:55.220 --> 00:18:58.880
But what would blondish have produced if she was given that same measure of

349
00:18:58.881 --> 00:18:59.570
support?

350
00:18:59.570 --> 00:19:03.680
The opportunities women gave Monet came at a cost to themselves that lives and

351
00:19:03.681 --> 00:19:04.430
their ambition.

352
00:19:04.430 --> 00:19:08.120
What adds insult to injury is that the launch canvases may produced with Basha

353
00:19:08.130 --> 00:19:11.000
support were underappreciated during my night's life,

354
00:19:11.210 --> 00:19:14.690
even though museums would construct special wings just to display these massive

355
00:19:14.691 --> 00:19:18.470
works of heartbreaking beauty side by side, as they were intended to be seen,

356
00:19:18.680 --> 00:19:20.060
audiences were unmoved.

357
00:19:20.180 --> 00:19:23.930
It wasn't as other 1950 it's thanks in large parts to the charitable estate

358
00:19:23.960 --> 00:19:27.860
builds by blonch that the launch canvases were recognized for the immense works

359
00:19:27.950 --> 00:19:29.030
of beauty that they were.

360
00:19:29.330 --> 00:19:31.940
Then they died at the age of 86 in accordance with his wishes.

361
00:19:31.941 --> 00:19:35.780
Only 50 of his closest friends attended one tore off the black around the coffin

362
00:19:35.781 --> 00:19:36.351
and draped it,

363
00:19:36.351 --> 00:19:41.060
and the floral printer fitting tributes for the color mad genius of the gardens.

364
00:19:41.150 --> 00:19:42.800
