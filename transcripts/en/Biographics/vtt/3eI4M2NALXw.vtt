00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:03.750
<v 0>Just before we get started, I do want to give a quick plug to my new podcast,</v>

2
00:00:03.751 --> 00:00:06.360
the casual criminalists. We cover a lot of crimes,

3
00:00:06.430 --> 00:00:08.370
criminals and bad things on this, Janet,

4
00:00:08.371 --> 00:00:13.320
because apparently you guys love the darker stuff. Well, dark hot out,

5
00:00:13.321 --> 00:00:17.400
because I have a long form about an hour weekly podcast covering some of the

6
00:00:17.401 --> 00:00:21.000
darkest things that I could find on the internet from the UK doxy,

7
00:00:21.090 --> 00:00:25.500
who the worst serial killer in history to that time and American socialite

8
00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:29.700
murdered their best friends with a car allegedly, and totally got away with it.

9
00:00:29.850 --> 00:00:33.270
And much more. It's also pretty laid back. It's a bit more free form,

10
00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:37.110
kind of like a podcast would be with the occasional laugh thrown in because

11
00:00:37.111 --> 00:00:38.310
isn't that hilarious.

12
00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:42.240
Weekly shows wherever you get your podcasts links below and let's get into it.

13
00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:51.830
It'd be understandable if you've never heard about our subject for today after

14
00:00:51.831 --> 00:00:54.440
all until 2010, nobody knew even existed,

15
00:00:54.650 --> 00:00:59.210
but then a routine police search uncovered his evil deeds to the entire world.

16
00:00:59.690 --> 00:01:02.660
Soon, it became apparent what investigators had stumbled upon.

17
00:01:02.870 --> 00:01:04.910
It was the dumping grounds of a serial killer.

18
00:01:05.300 --> 00:01:07.160
Why he we'd been active for over a decade,

19
00:01:07.161 --> 00:01:11.330
completely unknown to the authorities who casually discounted the dismembered

20
00:01:11.331 --> 00:01:15.770
remains of his victims in the same area and got away with it time and time

21
00:01:15.771 --> 00:01:16.460
again.

22
00:01:16.460 --> 00:01:20.750
And he still alludes justice investigators might have a profile and a few solid

23
00:01:20.751 --> 00:01:24.350
suspects, but ultimately the murder, his identity remains a mystery.

24
00:01:24.410 --> 00:01:28.130
We know him simply as LISC. The long Island serial killer

25
00:01:35.210 --> 00:01:36.590
Story starts somewhere in the middle on may,

26
00:01:36.591 --> 00:01:41.300
the first 2010 and a small remote community in New York state called

27
00:01:41.301 --> 00:01:43.970
Oak beach. It is located on Jones beach islands,

28
00:01:43.971 --> 00:01:46.160
which is one of the barrier islands, the makeup,

29
00:01:46.161 --> 00:01:49.130
the Southern coast of long Island. That was where Shannon Gilbert,

30
00:01:49.400 --> 00:01:51.710
24 year old escort from New Jersey.

31
00:01:51.860 --> 00:01:54.110
Met up with a client in the early hours of the morning.

32
00:01:54.111 --> 00:01:57.500
Gilbert ran out into the neighborhood screaming for help a neighbor named Gus

33
00:01:57.950 --> 00:02:00.800
Colletti opened the door. But when he asked Gilbert what the matter was,

34
00:02:00.830 --> 00:02:04.250
she was clearly in a frenzied state only saying, help me,

35
00:02:04.550 --> 00:02:08.030
help me over and over again. Could I see you went inside and called the police,

36
00:02:08.031 --> 00:02:11.660
but Shannon Gilbert disappeared before they arrived or sororities kept searching

37
00:02:11.661 --> 00:02:15.590
for her over the following months officially, this was a missing persons case,

38
00:02:15.591 --> 00:02:18.710
but the circumstances didn't really anticipate a happy ending.

39
00:02:18.710 --> 00:02:22.670
And soon enough police extended their search to areas where you might expect to

40
00:02:22.671 --> 00:02:24.650
find the body. This strategy paid off,

41
00:02:24.680 --> 00:02:28.400
except that nobody was really expecting or prepared for the discovery they were

42
00:02:28.401 --> 00:02:31.130
about to make. It was December the 11th, 2010,

43
00:02:31.190 --> 00:02:33.770
about nine months after Shannon Gilbert's disappearance,

44
00:02:33.920 --> 00:02:38.270
a canine unit was conducting a routine search through a weedy area on the side

45
00:02:38.271 --> 00:02:41.060
of the ocean Parkway that traverses Jones beach islands,

46
00:02:41.270 --> 00:02:43.790
close to a small community called Gilgo beach.

47
00:02:43.850 --> 00:02:47.450
The dog and its handler stumbled upon skeletal remains coming out of a burlap

48
00:02:47.451 --> 00:02:47.871
sack,

49
00:02:47.871 --> 00:02:51.920
which had almost disintegrated the bone stone out to belong to a 24 year old

50
00:02:52.280 --> 00:02:55.100
women, but they did not belong to Shannon Gilbert. In fact,

51
00:02:55.130 --> 00:02:59.770
the body was later identified as Melissa Barthelemy, who lived in the Bronx.

52
00:02:59.830 --> 00:03:03.310
She went missing outside of her apartments on July the 12th, 2009.

53
00:03:03.311 --> 00:03:06.970
And in the weeks that immediately followed her younger sister received multiple

54
00:03:06.971 --> 00:03:10.720
vulgar taunting phone calls from a strange man who said the Melissa was dead a

55
00:03:10.721 --> 00:03:13.810
couple of days after the discovery of Melissa's body police returned to the

56
00:03:13.811 --> 00:03:16.090
scene. This time with more manpower,

57
00:03:16.210 --> 00:03:20.110
they a suspicion that there was still more to be found in the area they were

58
00:03:20.111 --> 00:03:23.080
right. But again, it was not the remains of Shannon Gilbert.

59
00:03:23.230 --> 00:03:25.660
Instead police found the bodies of three more victims,

60
00:03:25.661 --> 00:03:28.750
all located within 500 feet of each other in an interview,

61
00:03:28.751 --> 00:03:31.360
Suffolk County police commissioner, Richard dormer, Zed,

62
00:03:31.361 --> 00:03:35.020
what everybody else was thinking. Four bodies found in the same location.

63
00:03:35.230 --> 00:03:38.110
Pretty much speaks for itself. It's more than a coincidence.

64
00:03:38.610 --> 00:03:39.990
<v 2>We could have a serial killer.</v>

65
00:03:46.470 --> 00:03:48.930
<v 0>Two days later, the FBI was brought in to help with a search.</v>

66
00:03:48.960 --> 00:03:52.470
The medical examiner concluded that all the remains belong to young women and

67
00:03:52.710 --> 00:03:54.990
use dental records, DNA comparisons,

68
00:03:54.991 --> 00:03:58.110
and facial reconstructions to try and identify them together.

69
00:03:58.111 --> 00:04:02.220
The victims were referred to as the Gilgo beach for also including the earlier

70
00:04:02.221 --> 00:04:06.150
discovery of Melissa Bottomley, who, but yet to be identified at this stage,

71
00:04:06.300 --> 00:04:07.800
it was in January, 2011.

72
00:04:07.920 --> 00:04:11.790
About a month after the gruesome find that the first identification was made for

73
00:04:11.791 --> 00:04:13.080
victim was Meghan Waterman,

74
00:04:13.081 --> 00:04:16.020
a 22 year old woman who disappeared on June the sixth,

75
00:04:16.050 --> 00:04:20.400
2010 last seen leaving the holiday Inn, express and homepage,

76
00:04:20.460 --> 00:04:24.090
New York, the other three women who are also identified later that same month.

77
00:04:24.150 --> 00:04:26.220
One was the AFA mentions Melissa Barthelemy.

78
00:04:26.310 --> 00:04:30.930
The meaning to where Maureen Brennan bombs at 25 year old single mother from

79
00:04:31.350 --> 00:04:34.190
Norridge, Connecticut who disappeared in July, 2007.

80
00:04:34.210 --> 00:04:38.460
And the Castello a 27 year old woman who appeared to be the most recent victim

81
00:04:38.580 --> 00:04:40.410
having gone missing on September. The second,

82
00:04:40.411 --> 00:04:45.330
2010 already a clear pattern began to emerge regarding the victims like

83
00:04:45.540 --> 00:04:48.000
Shannon Gilbert, all four women worked as escorts,

84
00:04:48.001 --> 00:04:51.420
at least on occasion before a disappearance, Maureen Brainard bonds.

85
00:04:51.540 --> 00:04:55.560
It temporarily relocated to a cheap motel in Manhattan where she, that clients,

86
00:04:55.770 --> 00:04:58.680
she did this as a last resort before getting evicted from our home.

87
00:04:58.800 --> 00:05:02.520
Megan Wars and mountain has a boyfriend slash pimp named Jackie Cruz who

88
00:05:02.790 --> 00:05:03.900
arranged dates of her.

89
00:05:04.170 --> 00:05:07.710
And even though police confiscated his laps offer info on his clients,

90
00:05:07.711 --> 00:05:09.690
they couldn't find any leads for a murder.

91
00:05:09.750 --> 00:05:11.700
And according to Amber Castelli's roommate,

92
00:05:11.701 --> 00:05:14.910
she was nervous about meeting our client the night of her disappearance,

93
00:05:14.911 --> 00:05:18.420
but eventually relented after he offered $1,500,

94
00:05:18.660 --> 00:05:20.670
almost six times the normal rate,

95
00:05:20.820 --> 00:05:22.950
there was another link that connected the victims,

96
00:05:23.010 --> 00:05:26.160
all of them off at their escort services on Craigslist.

97
00:05:26.250 --> 00:05:27.360
Once the media found out,

98
00:05:27.361 --> 00:05:30.870
some of them started referring to the culprit as the Craigslist ripper,

99
00:05:30.871 --> 00:05:34.440
although others do prefer the name, which was originally assigned to him,

100
00:05:34.710 --> 00:05:37.530
the Gilgo beach killer, as you are about to see, however,

101
00:05:37.710 --> 00:05:40.290
his area of activity extended beyond Gilgo beach.

102
00:05:40.291 --> 00:05:44.520
So the name that became the most widely used for him was the long Island serial

103
00:05:44.521 --> 00:05:45.600
killer or list.

104
00:05:45.960 --> 00:05:46.793
<v 2>Ask.</v>

105
00:05:52.770 --> 00:05:55.650
<v 0>These were fairly convinced that Shannon Gilbert's body was still out that</v>

106
00:05:55.680 --> 00:05:58.130
however, harsh weather conditions, the search difficult.

107
00:05:58.131 --> 00:06:01.610
So the Suffolk County police waited until spring and went back in,

108
00:06:01.611 --> 00:06:06.350
in late March about Somalis, the original site. They found a skull, a forearm,

109
00:06:06.351 --> 00:06:09.980
and a pair of hands. Once again, these did not belong to Shannon Gilbert,

110
00:06:10.010 --> 00:06:13.550
but rather to a 20 year old woman named Jessica Taylor, like the others,

111
00:06:13.970 --> 00:06:15.110
Taylor worked as a prostitute.

112
00:06:15.111 --> 00:06:17.660
So although it was never definitively established,

113
00:06:17.661 --> 00:06:20.690
if she used Craigslist to find plans, that was however,

114
00:06:20.750 --> 00:06:23.570
a more disturbing implication regarding the most recent find.

115
00:06:23.750 --> 00:06:28.280
Jessica Taylor had been murdered in 2003 police knew this because that torso had

116
00:06:28.281 --> 00:06:30.530
previously been found in July of that year.

117
00:06:30.770 --> 00:06:34.130
It had been discovered by a woman walking her dog off a utility road in

118
00:06:34.140 --> 00:06:36.620
Mandeville hamlets in the middle of long Island.

119
00:06:36.650 --> 00:06:39.650
This was almost five years earlier than any of the previous victims.

120
00:06:39.710 --> 00:06:43.400
And immediately raised concern that this could likely been active longer than

121
00:06:43.401 --> 00:06:44.540
everybody had expected.

122
00:06:44.541 --> 00:06:48.590
And that there were probably more victims out there waiting to be found.

123
00:06:48.800 --> 00:06:51.260
Investigators didn't have to wait long in early April.

124
00:06:51.261 --> 00:06:54.770
They went out again slowly making their way along the ocean Parkway.

125
00:06:54.860 --> 00:06:56.750
They found the remains of three more people.

126
00:06:56.930 --> 00:06:59.990
One of them was an Asian male in his late teens, early twenties,

127
00:06:59.991 --> 00:07:01.850
who was found dressed in women's clothing.

128
00:07:01.910 --> 00:07:04.010
The second was a young woman and the third,

129
00:07:04.040 --> 00:07:07.400
most disturbingly of all was a baby believed to be a girl,

130
00:07:07.640 --> 00:07:10.400
approximately two years old. It was a shocking revelation,

131
00:07:10.580 --> 00:07:13.760
not only due to the obvious reason of finding such a young victim,

132
00:07:13.910 --> 00:07:16.040
but also because it contradicted everything.

133
00:07:16.041 --> 00:07:19.340
The police thought they knew about LISC up until this point,

134
00:07:19.370 --> 00:07:22.910
there appeared to be a pattern, the killer preyed on the same kind of victim.

135
00:07:23.120 --> 00:07:27.350
And he seemingly used Craigslist as a convenient method of finding new targets.

136
00:07:27.440 --> 00:07:28.590
He usually strangled them.

137
00:07:29.000 --> 00:07:32.480
Men's then dumped their remains in remote areas along long islands ocean

138
00:07:32.481 --> 00:07:33.314
Parkway.

139
00:07:33.350 --> 00:07:36.890
That pattern now went out of the window because not only did the killer target a

140
00:07:36.891 --> 00:07:40.100
man and an infant, but he also switched his killing methods.

141
00:07:40.160 --> 00:07:44.480
As the Asian males course of death had been a blunt force impact to the head

142
00:07:44.481 --> 00:07:48.170
while the baby showed no outward signs of trauma because of the significant

143
00:07:48.171 --> 00:07:48.680
departure.

144
00:07:48.680 --> 00:07:52.160
Some criminologists have speculated that Lisk may not have been responsible for

145
00:07:52.161 --> 00:07:56.270
all of the murder victims found on the ocean Parkway and that there were two or

146
00:07:56.271 --> 00:07:59.780
even three killers to this day. The man and the child remained unidentified.

147
00:07:59.840 --> 00:08:03.320
They are simply referred to as Asian dough and baby DOE the third victim.

148
00:08:03.321 --> 00:08:06.800
However, who was a woman was only recently identified in May, 2020,

149
00:08:06.801 --> 00:08:08.390
thanks to genetic genealogy,

150
00:08:08.391 --> 00:08:11.930
which allowed investigators to track down her biological relatives.

151
00:08:11.990 --> 00:08:14.570
She was 24 year old, Valerie Mack from Philadelphia.

152
00:08:14.780 --> 00:08:17.450
And the situation was very similar to that of Jessica Taylor,

153
00:08:17.540 --> 00:08:21.770
only our skull hands and part of one foot were found along the ocean Parkway

154
00:08:21.771 --> 00:08:25.550
because the rest of her body had been discovered a years earlier by hikers in

155
00:08:25.551 --> 00:08:29.510
the long Island pine barons also located in the amount of milk like the other

156
00:08:29.511 --> 00:08:33.260
women Mack worked as a prostitute and was last seen in the area of port

157
00:08:33.270 --> 00:08:35.750
Republic, New Jersey. This happened in two thousands,

158
00:08:35.780 --> 00:08:39.350
thus pushing back the timeline by a few more years and showing that Lisk,

159
00:08:39.351 --> 00:08:42.440
if he was indeed responsible for the men of our killings had been active for

160
00:08:42.441 --> 00:08:45.050
over a decade before anyone knew even existed.

161
00:08:51.270 --> 00:08:55.260
Given the police kept finding new bodies every time they went out to search,

162
00:08:55.290 --> 00:08:57.510
they had no reason to assume this,

163
00:08:57.650 --> 00:09:00.930
this problem would only be contained in Suffolk County. Therefore,

164
00:09:00.931 --> 00:09:04.020
the neighbor in the South County police department began their own investigation

165
00:09:04.050 --> 00:09:07.740
just a week after the discovery of the remains of battery Mack and the two dose

166
00:09:08.010 --> 00:09:08.671
and the cell counts,

167
00:09:08.671 --> 00:09:12.960
the investigators went out to search their stretch of the ocean Parkway and made

168
00:09:12.961 --> 00:09:16.770
their own grim discoveries. They found the partial remains of two more women.

169
00:09:16.980 --> 00:09:20.730
One of them only a skull and some teeth like some of the previous victims.

170
00:09:20.760 --> 00:09:24.210
These do work later connected to body parts that had been found in other areas

171
00:09:24.211 --> 00:09:25.710
of long Island years prior.

172
00:09:25.920 --> 00:09:29.160
One of them was a young black woman whose dismembered torso had been recovered

173
00:09:29.161 --> 00:09:31.830
from Hempstead Lake state park back in 1997.

174
00:09:32.040 --> 00:09:33.870
She still remains on identifying to this day,

175
00:09:33.871 --> 00:09:37.980
but it was informally known as peaches based on a heart shaped peach tattoos she

176
00:09:37.981 --> 00:09:41.850
had on her chest is later this, as she was recognized by the artist who made it,

177
00:09:41.851 --> 00:09:45.390
who remembered that his client was around 18 or 19 years old and that she had

178
00:09:45.391 --> 00:09:47.070
come from the Bronx or long Island.

179
00:09:47.370 --> 00:09:52.230
Most significantly though DNA tests performed in 2016 revealed that peaches was

180
00:09:52.231 --> 00:09:56.550
in fact, the mother of baby DOE whose remains were found near Gilgo beach,

181
00:09:56.580 --> 00:09:59.610
creating a definitive link between two of the crime areas.

182
00:09:59.700 --> 00:10:02.220
The other victim from LaSalle County was only a skull,

183
00:10:02.250 --> 00:10:05.070
but police still managed to connect her to a pair of severed legs that were

184
00:10:05.071 --> 00:10:08.460
found in a garbage bag on fire islands. Back in 1996,

185
00:10:08.550 --> 00:10:12.360
she still is only known as fire Island, Jane DOE, and to does, unlike these,

186
00:10:12.361 --> 00:10:14.310
you will ever be identified as of this moment.

187
00:10:14.311 --> 00:10:18.000
She remains the oldest victim confidently attributed to lists showing us that he

188
00:10:18.001 --> 00:10:22.110
has been active for at least 15 years, between 1996 and 2010.

189
00:10:23.060 --> 00:10:23.893
<v 3>Okay.</v>

190
00:10:28.970 --> 00:10:32.780
<v 0>All the 10 victims, most commonly ascribed to the long Island serial killer.</v>

191
00:10:32.810 --> 00:10:35.000
But this is far from a certainty.

192
00:10:35.120 --> 00:10:38.870
Originally investigators worked under the belief that the area surrounding Gilgo

193
00:10:38.871 --> 00:10:42.950
beach served as the dumping grounds for three or even four serial killers.

194
00:10:43.040 --> 00:10:47.030
The Suffolk County district attorney's office in particular was adamant that

195
00:10:47.031 --> 00:10:50.360
there was no evidence that all of these remains were the work of a single

196
00:10:50.361 --> 00:10:51.110
killer.

197
00:10:51.110 --> 00:10:54.710
This would not have been unprecedented California's three-way color turned out

198
00:10:54.711 --> 00:10:58.160
to be three different murderers who acted independently from one another,

199
00:10:58.161 --> 00:11:01.370
but were active at the same time in the same place and targeted the same

200
00:11:01.371 --> 00:11:05.960
victims. The Texas killing fields refers to a patch of land off interstate 45.

201
00:11:06.050 --> 00:11:08.870
That was used as a dumping ground by several killers throughout the decades.

202
00:11:08.871 --> 00:11:11.480
Something similar could be possible with the LISC,

203
00:11:11.600 --> 00:11:15.800
but police eventually moved on from this idea is their investigation progressed.

204
00:11:15.830 --> 00:11:19.580
They conclude is that there were enough common denominators between the crimes

205
00:11:19.581 --> 00:11:22.280
to suggest one culprit due to the type of victim,

206
00:11:22.460 --> 00:11:26.240
the dismemberment and the dumping grounds in December,

207
00:11:26.240 --> 00:11:30.050
2011 a year and a half after it started police finished the search that launched

208
00:11:30.051 --> 00:11:33.710
this entire investigation. They found the body of Shannon Gilbert,

209
00:11:33.890 --> 00:11:37.220
the escort who was last seen fleeing a client's home in Oak beach.

210
00:11:37.460 --> 00:11:39.050
If they had never started looking for her,

211
00:11:39.350 --> 00:11:42.170
they might never have stumbled upon the remains in Gilgo beach.

212
00:11:42.171 --> 00:11:46.220
And the worlds might still be blissfully unaware of LISC's existence.

213
00:11:46.280 --> 00:11:49.970
But curiously investigators concluded that Gilbert was not among the killer's

214
00:11:49.971 --> 00:11:50.660
victims.

215
00:11:50.660 --> 00:11:55.060
Her remains were found in a swampy marshland half a mile from where she was last

216
00:11:55.061 --> 00:11:55.331
seen.

217
00:11:55.331 --> 00:11:58.960
And police believed that she drowned accidentally while running away a family

218
00:11:58.961 --> 00:12:02.590
disagreed and organized an independent autopsy with a pathologist found that

219
00:12:02.770 --> 00:12:06.730
Gilbert had sustained injuries, consistent with homicidal strangulation,

220
00:12:06.731 --> 00:12:09.670
but was unable to say with certainty that she was murdered.

221
00:12:09.730 --> 00:12:12.670
But the moment Shannon Gilbert remains a possible connection to the case,

222
00:12:12.671 --> 00:12:16.750
but she is not the only one in this situation in 2013,

223
00:12:16.751 --> 00:12:20.770
a 31 year old woman named Natasha Jugo disappeared while leaving her home in

224
00:12:20.771 --> 00:12:23.680
Queens, her car was found abandoned on ocean Parkway,

225
00:12:23.830 --> 00:12:28.090
ends our body or washed up on Gilgo beach. Soon after also in 2013,

226
00:12:28.091 --> 00:12:31.780
the skeletal remains of an Asian woman were found in the South County in a

227
00:12:31.781 --> 00:12:35.050
garbage bag. Now oyster Bay. She is still unidentified.

228
00:12:35.120 --> 00:12:39.310
It was probably between 20 and 30 years old and was wearing a necklace with a 24

229
00:12:39.311 --> 00:12:40.870
karat gold pig pendants.

230
00:12:40.930 --> 00:12:45.160
The dismembered remains of a woman named Tina Foglia founds in three separate

231
00:12:45.161 --> 00:12:45.941
garbage bags,

232
00:12:45.941 --> 00:12:49.840
just a few malls from the Robert Moses Causeway that needs to go go beach.

233
00:12:49.900 --> 00:12:54.640
This could possibly be linked to LISC, but she was killed way back in 1982.

234
00:12:54.641 --> 00:12:59.140
And what is either an unrelated crime or perhaps the killer's earliest murder.

235
00:12:59.230 --> 00:13:00.670
And there are more, as you can see,

236
00:13:00.850 --> 00:13:03.640
all of these cases have things in common with the less,

237
00:13:03.670 --> 00:13:07.900
whether it is the location, the victim similarity, or the vicious dismemberment.

238
00:13:07.990 --> 00:13:11.170
However, it is almost impossible to prove a definitive connection.

239
00:13:11.171 --> 00:13:14.950
So unless we eventually identify LISC and get to confession,

240
00:13:15.190 --> 00:13:17.790
that will always be doubt over the true number.

241
00:13:17.970 --> 00:13:18.803
<v 1>The victims.</v>

242
00:13:25.820 --> 00:13:29.160
<v 0>At the million dollar question, who is the long Island serial killer? Well,</v>

243
00:13:29.161 --> 00:13:30.960
we can't answer that. Not at the moment.

244
00:13:30.961 --> 00:13:33.810
At least LISC remains unidentified and at large,

245
00:13:33.840 --> 00:13:35.460
but that could change in the near future.

246
00:13:35.520 --> 00:13:39.660
Unlike other notorious and unnamed serial killers like the Zodiac or the mad

247
00:13:39.661 --> 00:13:41.070
butcher of Kingsbury run.

248
00:13:41.280 --> 00:13:45.660
This is very much an active investigation with new developments every year.

249
00:13:45.720 --> 00:13:48.810
Like we previously mentioned, it wasn't until earlier in 2020,

250
00:13:48.960 --> 00:13:49.680
but one of the victims,

251
00:13:49.680 --> 00:13:53.070
Valerie Mac was finally identified also at the beginning of the year,

252
00:13:53.071 --> 00:13:55.620
police came forward and presented a key piece of evidence,

253
00:13:55.650 --> 00:13:57.450
hoping that someone might recognize it.

254
00:13:57.540 --> 00:14:02.400
It was a black leather belt with the initials, wh or H M embossed on it,

255
00:14:02.430 --> 00:14:03.990
depending on how you held it.

256
00:14:04.140 --> 00:14:07.200
I spokesman for the police also mentioned that they did not believe the belt

257
00:14:07.201 --> 00:14:11.550
belongs to any of the victims, but would not specify if it had any DNA on it,

258
00:14:11.700 --> 00:14:14.670
or if it would have been used as a murder weapon. Unfortunately for us,

259
00:14:14.671 --> 00:14:18.990
an active investigation also means that police can be very scarce with the

260
00:14:18.991 --> 00:14:21.780
details made available to the public. The leather belt, for example,

261
00:14:21.781 --> 00:14:24.870
was discovered at one of the original crime scenes back in 2010.

262
00:14:25.020 --> 00:14:28.350
And it wasn't until a decade later that they finally went public with it.

263
00:14:28.560 --> 00:14:32.910
This is also why the most detailed profile on list that's accessible to us said

264
00:14:33.330 --> 00:14:37.140
then compiled by the New York times using only publicly available information,

265
00:14:37.230 --> 00:14:40.500
they said that LISC is most likely a white male in his mid twenties to mid

266
00:14:40.501 --> 00:14:44.550
forties. He is married or has a girlfriend. He is well-educated and well-spoken,

267
00:14:44.610 --> 00:14:48.330
he is financially secure and has a job and owns an expensive car or truck.

268
00:14:48.540 --> 00:14:52.610
He may have sought treatment at a hospital or for poison Ivy infection as part

269
00:14:52.611 --> 00:14:57.050
of his job or interests he has access to or stockpile of burlap

270
00:14:57.051 --> 00:14:59.720
sacks. And according to one of their expert consultants,

271
00:15:00.080 --> 00:15:04.370
LISC is a psychosexual Seders to derive pleasure from the murder itself,

272
00:15:04.400 --> 00:15:06.500
meaning that he kills for the sake of killing,

273
00:15:06.710 --> 00:15:09.140
rather than having any additional motives.

274
00:15:09.170 --> 00:15:12.080
This also lends itself to other similar impulses,

275
00:15:12.081 --> 00:15:15.140
such as calling the victims families to taunt them. Lastly,

276
00:15:15.141 --> 00:15:19.100
the profile points out that there might be a seasonal component to the killer's

277
00:15:19.101 --> 00:15:23.270
activities. And most of his victims went missing in the summer. Early autumn.

278
00:15:23.390 --> 00:15:27.350
This profile was partially corroborated by an unlikely source. Joel Rifkin,

279
00:15:27.380 --> 00:15:30.800
probably New York city's most prolific serial killer for a while.

280
00:15:30.801 --> 00:15:34.310
People have speculated that some of the victims could have been killed by Rifkin

281
00:15:34.311 --> 00:15:36.710
because he used to live in long Island for a time.

282
00:15:36.860 --> 00:15:40.310
He has denied this saying that he has nothing to do with those bodies even.

283
00:15:40.311 --> 00:15:44.300
So he would only have been eligible for the earliest victims like Tina Foglia

284
00:15:44.350 --> 00:15:46.820
since he was apprehended back in 1993, anyway,

285
00:15:46.890 --> 00:15:49.040
Rifkin might have no involvement in these killings,

286
00:15:49.041 --> 00:15:52.910
but he believes that the culprit is someone who would go unnoticed while walking

287
00:15:52.911 --> 00:15:56.480
around with big burlap sacks, someone like a fisherman or landscaper.

288
00:15:56.570 --> 00:15:59.960
He also thinks that LISC is a local since he appears to have a connection with

289
00:15:59.961 --> 00:16:01.610
the area around Gilgo beach,

290
00:16:01.611 --> 00:16:05.120
where he dumps the remains with no official profile released by the police or

291
00:16:05.121 --> 00:16:05.661
the FBI.

292
00:16:05.661 --> 00:16:08.660
Other sources gave that to you since after consulting with a few experts,

293
00:16:08.661 --> 00:16:12.530
ABC news floated the possibility that LISC might have some sort of involvement

294
00:16:12.531 --> 00:16:13.460
with law enforcement,

295
00:16:13.461 --> 00:16:16.190
because he seemed to display knowledge of police procedures.

296
00:16:16.220 --> 00:16:17.870
Whenever he called his victim's families,

297
00:16:17.871 --> 00:16:21.590
he made sure to do it from a very crowded place like new York's Penn station.

298
00:16:21.830 --> 00:16:24.080
And he never stayed on the line for more than three minutes

299
00:16:30.670 --> 00:16:34.240
Profile is assigned. Do investigators have any actual suspects in the killings?

300
00:16:34.450 --> 00:16:36.130
Well, yes. As a matter of fact,

301
00:16:36.160 --> 00:16:40.210
they do have a few as their strongest candidate is a man named John better-off.

302
00:16:40.270 --> 00:16:43.720
He happens to be a convicted serial killer who also lived in Mandeville,

303
00:16:43.721 --> 00:16:46.990
the place where the body parts of several victims were found soon after they had

304
00:16:46.991 --> 00:16:49.510
been killed. And he also worked as a carpenter,

305
00:16:49.540 --> 00:16:52.570
meaning that he had plenty of cutting tools and burlap sacks.

306
00:16:52.660 --> 00:16:55.660
This role first appeared on the police's radar. In 2013,

307
00:16:55.661 --> 00:16:59.440
when his brother Timothy was arrested for a misdemeanor as standard procedure,

308
00:16:59.441 --> 00:17:02.260
he submitted a DNA test, which was later flagged doesn't match.

309
00:17:02.261 --> 00:17:04.150
The DNA found at two murder sites.

310
00:17:04.180 --> 00:17:08.770
Those of Rita tan created in 1993 and Kilian McNaney in 1994,

311
00:17:08.771 --> 00:17:11.830
both beaten to death and strangled. The match was only a partial,

312
00:17:11.831 --> 00:17:14.590
which meant that Timothy bittrolff was not the culprits,

313
00:17:14.620 --> 00:17:18.940
but the two were related. That is how police eventually arrived. John bittrolff,

314
00:17:18.941 --> 00:17:23.800
who has since been convicted in 2017 and is serving two consecutive 25 to life

315
00:17:23.801 --> 00:17:26.140
sentences. Ever since better-off was identified.

316
00:17:26.141 --> 00:17:30.070
He was also suspected in a third unrelated murder, but after his conviction,

317
00:17:30.071 --> 00:17:34.510
the prosecutor specified that he was being investigated in at least some of the

318
00:17:34.511 --> 00:17:37.930
crimes attributed to LISC. The killings do seem to have a lot in common.

319
00:17:38.290 --> 00:17:42.010
The troughs victims were found in Suffolk County where Gilgo beach is located.

320
00:17:42.250 --> 00:17:44.530
They were also believed to work as escorts.

321
00:17:44.590 --> 00:17:47.350
And there is even a personal connection between Rita to ingredient.

322
00:17:47.500 --> 00:17:49.950
One of lists cause victims, Melissa Bothell, me.

323
00:17:50.160 --> 00:17:54.030
She was allegedly best friends with 10 Greenies daughter there's Rolf's murders

324
00:17:54.090 --> 00:17:56.760
lacks the horrendous mutilations of LISC.

325
00:17:56.790 --> 00:17:59.580
But since his were committed in the early nineties,

326
00:17:59.730 --> 00:18:03.480
it would not be unheard of for a killer to escalate the level of violence as

327
00:18:03.481 --> 00:18:06.570
timelines on the investigation into better-off is ongoing.

328
00:18:06.570 --> 00:18:08.910
But what if someone else is the culprits after all,

329
00:18:08.911 --> 00:18:11.910
it's highly unlikely that John bittrolff will ever be released from prison,

330
00:18:11.911 --> 00:18:16.200
whether or not he is LISC this, if he is not the Gilgo beach killer,

331
00:18:16.350 --> 00:18:20.310
then focusing solely on him will allow the real culprits to have a justice.

332
00:18:20.520 --> 00:18:23.040
Admittedly, there are a few more names aspects,

333
00:18:23.041 --> 00:18:27.390
but none of them make as good a case as bittrolff one would be Joseph Brewer,

334
00:18:27.420 --> 00:18:30.720
the man who hired Shannon Gilbert or Craigslist, the night of her disappearance,

335
00:18:30.930 --> 00:18:32.550
he would make a pretty obvious candidate.

336
00:18:32.700 --> 00:18:36.060
The police said he cooperated fully with the investigation and was dismissed as

337
00:18:36.061 --> 00:18:38.130
a suspect years ago, just late last year.

338
00:18:38.131 --> 00:18:41.580
A man from long islands named Andrew Frey was arrested on multiple counts of

339
00:18:41.581 --> 00:18:43.530
attempted kidnapping and sex trafficking.

340
00:18:43.740 --> 00:18:47.190
Two prostitutes came forward claiming that he allegedly tried to take them to a

341
00:18:47.191 --> 00:18:51.630
secluded area by force, both having escaped by jumping out of his moving cop.

342
00:18:51.720 --> 00:18:52.201
Afterwards,

343
00:18:52.201 --> 00:18:55.740
several other escorts claims that they had violent encounters with fray. One,

344
00:18:55.741 --> 00:18:59.520
even saying that she was forced to take out an order of protection against him,

345
00:18:59.521 --> 00:19:02.790
which he violated by calling her and leaving a threatening voicemails.

346
00:19:02.970 --> 00:19:06.690
New York authorities said that Frey had a propensity to commit violence against

347
00:19:06.691 --> 00:19:09.390
female sex workers. But since the case is ongoing,

348
00:19:09.391 --> 00:19:11.100
he has yet to be convicted of anything.

349
00:19:11.101 --> 00:19:14.670
And there haven't been any connections established to the Gogo beach murders.

350
00:19:14.790 --> 00:19:18.300
Unlike most of the other killing sprees, new involve unidentified murderers.

351
00:19:18.450 --> 00:19:21.990
This one is an active investigation with a genuine chance of reaching a

352
00:19:21.991 --> 00:19:24.750
conclusion who knows maybe a year or two from now,

353
00:19:24.751 --> 00:19:26.700
the identity of the killer will be discovered.

354
00:19:27.000 --> 00:19:31.050
We can do a follow-up video on this, but until then, thanks for watching.

355
00:19:39.560 --> 00:19:39.560
