00:00:18.980 --> 00:00:19.160
<v 1>Is.</v>

7
00:00:19.160 --> 00:00:23.060
<v 0>Dawn of the 14th century. I mean, not right now, but in our story,</v>

8
00:00:23.180 --> 00:00:27.410
the kingdom of Scotland is in chaos over a dozen Nobles have made a claim for

9
00:00:27.411 --> 00:00:31.160
the throne threatening to plunge the country into civil war. Meanwhile,

10
00:00:31.190 --> 00:00:34.610
the King of England is making a play for control of his Northern neighbor,

11
00:00:34.640 --> 00:00:36.770
hoping to take advantage of the power vacuum,

12
00:00:36.771 --> 00:00:41.300
to unify all of great Britain under a single roulette. But as son Sue said,

13
00:00:41.540 --> 00:00:45.110
in the midst of chaos, there is also opportunity Robert,

14
00:00:45.111 --> 00:00:48.890
the Bruce member of a Scottish Nobel family certainly took this to heart,

15
00:00:49.130 --> 00:00:53.240
using a mix of doggy determination, tactical acumen, and political savvy.

16
00:00:53.420 --> 00:00:57.590
The reus fought off all internal rivals and then made war on England,

17
00:00:57.620 --> 00:01:02.150
throwing the English out of the country and establishing himself as the one true

18
00:01:02.151 --> 00:01:04.070
ruler of Scotland. By doing this,

19
00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:07.280
he not only became the most important King in the history of Scotland,

20
00:01:07.460 --> 00:01:12.170
but his actions had far reaching consequences that continue to be felt to this

21
00:01:12.171 --> 00:01:13.004
very day.

22
00:01:19.010 --> 00:01:19.150
<v 1>[Inaudible].</v>

23
00:01:19.150 --> 00:01:23.870
<v 0>I was born in July, the 11th, 1274, the eldest son of Robert to Bruce,</v>

24
00:01:23.871 --> 00:01:25.640
the Lord of Annandale,

25
00:01:25.790 --> 00:01:29.900
the powerful noble in the kingdom of Scotland literally is recorded of his early

26
00:01:29.901 --> 00:01:32.870
life that we can assume he was brought up in much the same way.

27
00:01:32.871 --> 00:01:36.620
As most Nobles of the period were educated in multiple languages,

28
00:01:36.970 --> 00:01:41.300
via arts and skills of war and the politics and customs of the raw course in

29
00:01:41.301 --> 00:01:43.400
1286, the King of Scots Alexander,

30
00:01:43.401 --> 00:01:45.860
the third died suddenly after falling off his horse,

31
00:01:46.040 --> 00:01:49.400
his only living descendant was a young granddaughter Margaret who was the

32
00:01:49.401 --> 00:01:51.740
daughter of the King of Norway as was customary.

33
00:01:51.741 --> 00:01:53.510
When a child ascended to the throne,

34
00:01:53.511 --> 00:01:57.080
a council of regions called the guardians of Scotland were appointed to govern

35
00:01:57.081 --> 00:02:00.200
the country until Margaret was old enough to rule by herself.

36
00:02:00.230 --> 00:02:03.860
But it wasn't a me Margaret died in 1290 at the age of seven,

37
00:02:03.890 --> 00:02:07.310
never having set foot in the kingdom that she was supposed to rule. Now,

38
00:02:07.311 --> 00:02:09.410
the guardians were faced with a huge problem.

39
00:02:09.560 --> 00:02:14.060
The 250 year long reign of the house of Dunkeld had ended with the death of

40
00:02:14.090 --> 00:02:17.750
Alexandra Margarets and a new Monarch needed to be crowns.

41
00:02:17.870 --> 00:02:22.160
But who I told you a of 13 Nobles made claims on the throne of Scotland,

42
00:02:22.190 --> 00:02:23.930
one of which was Robert Bruce.

43
00:02:23.960 --> 00:02:28.370
The guardians were afraid that any attempt to resolve the matter internally

44
00:02:28.490 --> 00:02:30.710
would lead to civil war. So they asked King Edward,

45
00:02:30.711 --> 00:02:33.050
the first of England do arbitrary in the dispute,

46
00:02:33.290 --> 00:02:36.590
Edwards known as long shanks because at six foot two,

47
00:02:36.591 --> 00:02:40.700
he towered over most men of his day was eager to take advantage of the chaotic

48
00:02:40.701 --> 00:02:44.450
situation for his own ends. Before agreeing to the arbitration,

49
00:02:44.451 --> 00:02:48.470
he forced the guardians to make concessions to him stopping just short of

50
00:02:48.471 --> 00:02:52.550
declaring Scotland, a planned state over lauded by King Edward, Edward,

51
00:02:52.610 --> 00:02:57.470
then set up a quarter of 104 auditors' to decide who should be declared King of

52
00:02:57.471 --> 00:03:01.390
the Scots. The process that was known as the great cause for two years,

53
00:03:01.391 --> 00:03:03.970
the court heard arguments from various claimants.

54
00:03:04.120 --> 00:03:08.590
The court decided in favor of John Balliol, thought of Galway in 1292,

55
00:03:08.740 --> 00:03:10.300
but the real winner had been Edward.

56
00:03:16.740 --> 00:03:17.550
<v 1>[Inaudible].</v>

57
00:03:17.550 --> 00:03:20.100
<v 0>Four years. Edward continue to assert pressure on Scotland,</v>

58
00:03:20.130 --> 00:03:23.820
forcing further concessions and relations between Edward and John Valley.

59
00:03:23.821 --> 00:03:26.340
All soon began to deteriorate the Bruces.

60
00:03:26.341 --> 00:03:28.920
At this time sided with Edward in the disputes,

61
00:03:28.950 --> 00:03:33.480
they hated barley and considered him a usurper this put them into conflict,

62
00:03:33.481 --> 00:03:36.150
but the come in clan staunch supporters of Bally.

63
00:03:36.540 --> 00:03:39.870
Oland's one of the most powerful families in the country. In 1296,

64
00:03:39.871 --> 00:03:43.590
the Bruces were living in Carlisle castle and English Fords that had been given

65
00:03:43.591 --> 00:03:44.730
to them by King Edwards.

66
00:03:44.731 --> 00:03:48.750
After being driven out of Scotland by the Cummins in March of 1296,

67
00:03:48.751 --> 00:03:51.420
color was attacked by members of the coming faction,

68
00:03:51.450 --> 00:03:54.360
who hopes to eliminate their rivals, the attack failed.

69
00:03:54.361 --> 00:03:58.830
But the incursion onto English soil gave Edward an excuse to invade Scotland and

70
00:03:58.831 --> 00:04:00.600
take over the whole country. Personally,

71
00:04:00.630 --> 00:04:03.780
he deposed John Balliol and imprisoned him in the tower of London.

72
00:04:03.870 --> 00:04:08.130
Edward believed that Scotland had been pacified and he returned South to deal

73
00:04:08.310 --> 00:04:10.680
with the French, but the trouble in the North,

74
00:04:10.710 --> 00:04:14.280
it was only really just beginning in may, 1297,

75
00:04:14.281 --> 00:04:18.450
a rebellion against English control of Scotland began led by William Wallace and

76
00:04:18.630 --> 00:04:23.400
Andrew Demaret Roberts ordered by Edward to go with his retainers and suppress

77
00:04:23.401 --> 00:04:27.180
the rebellion, had a change of heart on routes. And when he arrived,

78
00:04:27.210 --> 00:04:30.570
he decided to join with the Scots all as in Demari,

79
00:04:30.571 --> 00:04:34.320
won a great victory over the English at the battle of Stirling bridge in July.

80
00:04:34.590 --> 00:04:39.180
But the Bruce, along with most of the other Nobles, they went there instead.

81
00:04:39.240 --> 00:04:44.100
They were engaged in intense negotiations with King Edward William Wallace fell

82
00:04:44.101 --> 00:04:47.760
from grace after he was defeated by Edward at the battle of Falco and

83
00:04:47.970 --> 00:04:52.650
July, 1298. And in his place, two new guardians of Scotland were appointed.

84
00:04:52.920 --> 00:04:55.920
Robert, the Bruce and John Cannon of Baton Ark.

85
00:04:55.980 --> 00:05:00.120
This attempt at national unity backfired as the two men were mortal enemies.

86
00:05:00.121 --> 00:05:04.860
And couldn't agree on anything early in 1302, Robert switched sides again,

87
00:05:04.861 --> 00:05:09.060
and swore loyalty to King Edwards. It's likely he did this for two reasons.

88
00:05:09.180 --> 00:05:13.170
The Nobles in Scotland were increasingly coalescing around the idea of John

89
00:05:13.171 --> 00:05:16.260
Balliol being returned to the throne. And if that happens,

90
00:05:16.680 --> 00:05:19.500
Robert would lose his chance to wear the crown himself. Also,

91
00:05:19.590 --> 00:05:23.340
it looked as though Edward was winning the war and Robert believed the smart

92
00:05:23.341 --> 00:05:24.660
play was to bide his time.

93
00:05:24.690 --> 00:05:29.220
Perhaps even wait until the 60 three-year-old Edward died before making his

94
00:05:29.221 --> 00:05:30.054
move.

95
00:05:35.790 --> 00:05:36.150
<v 1>[Inaudible].</v>

96
00:05:36.150 --> 00:05:39.900
<v 0>The Bruce was now playing a very delicate game outwardly. He supported Edwards,</v>

97
00:05:39.901 --> 00:05:42.000
hold on Scotland behind the scenes. However,

98
00:05:42.060 --> 00:05:45.570
he was rallying support for his own bid for the throne of Scotland,

99
00:05:45.660 --> 00:05:49.080
a significant obstacle presented itself in the form of John Cummin.

100
00:05:49.500 --> 00:05:52.860
Robert's rival considered the most powerful noble in the country in the summer

101
00:05:52.861 --> 00:05:56.400
of 1305, shortly after the capture and execution of William Wallace.

102
00:05:56.550 --> 00:05:58.880
The Bruce made a deal with coming that come in,

103
00:05:58.910 --> 00:06:03.440
would renounce his claim to the throne in exchange for all of the Bruce land in

104
00:06:03.441 --> 00:06:07.160
Scotland. If he supported a revolt led by the Bruce,

105
00:06:07.190 --> 00:06:11.750
but sometime later coming betrayed the Bruce's intentions to King Edwards and

106
00:06:11.930 --> 00:06:15.620
Robert was forced to flee the English course to avoid arrest outraged.

107
00:06:15.770 --> 00:06:19.940
Robert set a meeting with come in at the grey FRAs monastery in Dumfries on

108
00:06:20.090 --> 00:06:22.610
February the 10th, 1306 during the meeting,

109
00:06:22.730 --> 00:06:26.870
the Bruce accused Kevin of treachery and the two men actually came to blows in a

110
00:06:26.871 --> 00:06:27.500
fit of rage.

111
00:06:27.500 --> 00:06:32.240
Robert drew his dagger and stabbed coming as retain is then rushed in and killed

112
00:06:32.241 --> 00:06:35.870
the man immediately. Robert realized the gravity of what had done.

113
00:06:35.871 --> 00:06:37.610
He had shed blood in a church.

114
00:06:37.611 --> 00:06:41.450
The ultimate sacrilege furthermore had killed one of the most powerful men in

115
00:06:41.451 --> 00:06:46.250
Britain guaranteeing the animosity of Cummins allies and relatives on both sides

116
00:06:46.251 --> 00:06:48.410
of the border. The die had been cost.

117
00:06:48.411 --> 00:06:51.710
He needed to make his play for the throne right now,

118
00:06:52.040 --> 00:06:55.850
robo wins at Glasgow and met with Robert [inaudible] Bishop of Glasgow.

119
00:06:56.060 --> 00:07:00.440
We saw it was a friend and ally of his and grunted in absolution for the

120
00:07:00.441 --> 00:07:00.980
killing.

121
00:07:00.980 --> 00:07:04.910
We sought also made arrangements to have Robert crowns King six weeks later at

122
00:07:04.911 --> 00:07:08.090
scone, the traditional coronation location of Scottish Kings.

123
00:07:08.240 --> 00:07:12.650
The Bruce was crowned Robert the first King of Scots with all the usual pomp and

124
00:07:12.651 --> 00:07:15.320
ceremony. And England's the news was met with outrage.

125
00:07:15.350 --> 00:07:19.010
Edward believed that Robert had committed an egregious sin by murdering his

126
00:07:19.011 --> 00:07:20.030
rival in a church.

127
00:07:20.060 --> 00:07:23.990
And now he was compounding that sin by claiming a crown that Edward believed

128
00:07:24.020 --> 00:07:24.853
belonged to him.

129
00:07:24.890 --> 00:07:28.460
He called Robert and outlaw and sends an army North under command of his son,

130
00:07:28.461 --> 00:07:30.020
the Prince of Wales to crush him.

131
00:07:30.050 --> 00:07:34.820
The Prince was flying the dragon banner symbol that the usual rules of chivalry

132
00:07:34.850 --> 00:07:37.640
did not apply. No prisoners were going to be taken.

133
00:07:37.850 --> 00:07:40.430
And any enemies captured were going to be executed.

134
00:07:40.520 --> 00:07:45.080
What had been the political conflict would now become very, very personal.

135
00:07:51.670 --> 00:07:54.610
Robert did not yet heard that had been excommunicated by the poeple that King

136
00:07:54.611 --> 00:07:55.960
Edward considered him an alcohol.

137
00:07:55.990 --> 00:08:00.880
He raised an army of about 4,500 men and marched to Perth where an

138
00:08:00.881 --> 00:08:03.560
English force about 3000 was Garrison commands.

139
00:08:03.700 --> 00:08:05.980
It's by one of Edward's trusted left tenants,

140
00:08:05.981 --> 00:08:10.750
the out of Pembroke Robert calls on Pembroke to come out of Perth and do battle

141
00:08:10.990 --> 00:08:12.100
chivalric tradition,

142
00:08:12.130 --> 00:08:16.270
but Pembroke claims that it was too late in the day and they would fight

143
00:08:16.271 --> 00:08:18.610
tomorrow. So Robert's army made camp for the night,

144
00:08:18.611 --> 00:08:22.090
about six miles away near the village of methane while the Bruce's army was

145
00:08:22.091 --> 00:08:23.080
settling in for the night,

146
00:08:23.081 --> 00:08:25.660
suddenly the English fell upon them in a surprise attack.

147
00:08:25.720 --> 00:08:28.840
Sneak attacks and night fighting in general were not in keeping with the

148
00:08:28.841 --> 00:08:32.170
chivalric code, but since the English claimed that Robert was an outlaw,

149
00:08:32.200 --> 00:08:36.250
they didn't have to act Chavez towards him or any of his followers taken

150
00:08:36.251 --> 00:08:37.270
completely by surprise.

151
00:08:37.270 --> 00:08:41.440
The Scott stood no chance of the 4,500 that made up Robert Sarney,

152
00:08:41.590 --> 00:08:45.520
at least 4,000 of them were either killed or taken captive, and then executed.

153
00:08:45.700 --> 00:08:49.060
The Bruce was forced to flee with a small group of men having lost many of his

154
00:08:49.061 --> 00:08:52.360
most loyal followers, more bad news followed the Prince of Wales captured,

155
00:08:52.361 --> 00:08:56.370
killed Rummy counseling in September where Robert's daughter and sisters were

156
00:08:56.371 --> 00:08:58.440
sheltering. The Britain said Robert's brother Neil,

157
00:08:58.441 --> 00:09:01.890
the commander of the causal executed and took the women captive taking them to

158
00:09:01.891 --> 00:09:04.260
England. Now, just before we continue with today's video,

159
00:09:04.261 --> 00:09:06.810
do you want to take a moment to tell you about today's fantastic sponsor

160
00:09:07.620 --> 00:09:10.860
blankets? Now, look, I know it's not always easy to sit down and read a book.

161
00:09:10.861 --> 00:09:11.370
You know,

162
00:09:11.370 --> 00:09:15.990
we all lead busy lives and I certainly find myself with less time to read than I

163
00:09:15.991 --> 00:09:20.550
used to have, but the good news is I have the Blinkist app.

164
00:09:20.580 --> 00:09:23.250

183
00:10:26.600 --> 00:10:26.630
<v 3>[Inaudible].</v>

184
00:10:26.630 --> 00:10:30.470
<v 0>It's been a winter in hiding likely in the Hebrides islands off the Western</v>

185
00:10:30.471 --> 00:10:33.470
coast of Scotland. The year have been a disaster for him.

186
00:10:33.471 --> 00:10:37.460
And he seemed to destined for obscurity as a leader of yet another failed

187
00:10:37.461 --> 00:10:41.360
rebellion against English rule in Scotland. But even at this low point,

188
00:10:41.390 --> 00:10:45.170
Robin was convinced of the righteousness of his cause the Bruce realized that

189
00:10:45.260 --> 00:10:47.060
before he could take on the English again,

190
00:10:47.120 --> 00:10:50.480
he needed to deal with the enemies in Scotland, the Cummins,

191
00:10:50.481 --> 00:10:52.130
because most of his supporters were gone.

192
00:10:52.131 --> 00:10:54.080
He couldn't hope to win and traditional battle.

193
00:10:54.200 --> 00:10:58.010
Instead he would rely on hit and run tactics to loot and burn and destroy

194
00:10:58.040 --> 00:11:02.120
support for his enemies from the civilian population in February, 1307,

195
00:11:02.450 --> 00:11:06.530
Roberts forces came back to mainland Scotland. Initially things didn't go well.

196
00:11:06.531 --> 00:11:08.450
There's one part of his army was destroyed.

197
00:11:08.451 --> 00:11:11.150
And two more brothers Thomas and Alexander were killed.

198
00:11:11.180 --> 00:11:13.340
Robert went to his family's ancestral lands,

199
00:11:13.341 --> 00:11:16.790
a character raise man and supplies for his campaign.

200
00:11:16.970 --> 00:11:20.600
The English went off to him with an army of 3000 commanded by Pembroke.

201
00:11:20.780 --> 00:11:22.670
Who'd beaten the Bruce the year before,

202
00:11:22.700 --> 00:11:26.720
but this time Robert was ready for him at Lou downhill on may the 10th,

203
00:11:26.840 --> 00:11:29.510
the King traps Pembroke's army in a narrow Causeway,

204
00:11:29.511 --> 00:11:33.620
surrounded by marshlands and killed hundreds of English Knights forcing the rest

205
00:11:33.621 --> 00:11:36.860
of the army to retreating confusion with the English army subdued.

206
00:11:36.890 --> 00:11:39.800
Robert could turn his attention to the Cummins. Meanwhile,

207
00:11:39.830 --> 00:11:42.680
King Edward decided to go North himself and fight the Bruce.

208
00:11:42.800 --> 00:11:45.590
But while traveling North, the King became ill with dysentery.

209
00:11:45.620 --> 00:11:48.170
He died on July the seventh at the age of 68,

210
00:11:48.230 --> 00:11:51.050
the Prince of Wales was now crowned King Edward. The second,

211
00:11:51.200 --> 00:11:55.750
this was good news for Robert Edward. The, it was definitely not his father.

212
00:11:55.810 --> 00:11:59.110
The younger Edward was not as intimidating. And more importantly,

213
00:11:59.170 --> 00:12:02.050
it was not as interested in running the affairs of the state himself,

214
00:12:02.170 --> 00:12:04.420
leaving the country in the care of subordinates,

215
00:12:04.450 --> 00:12:07.150
particularly his favorite pairs, Galveston,

216
00:12:07.180 --> 00:12:11.020
who is alleged to have been Edward's lover while the new King of England headed

217
00:12:11.021 --> 00:12:13.360
South to consolidate his hold on power in England.

218
00:12:13.420 --> 00:12:16.030
Robert headed to the North of Scotland where the Cummins,

219
00:12:16.390 --> 00:12:18.790
their base of power over the course of the next 18 months,

220
00:12:18.791 --> 00:12:23.650
he systematically crushed all internal opposition to his authority capturing and

221
00:12:23.651 --> 00:12:25.210
destroying every stronghold.

222
00:12:25.211 --> 00:12:28.270
The Cummins had burning and killing the inhabitants.

223
00:12:34.290 --> 00:12:34.470
<v 2>[Inaudible].</v>

224
00:12:34.470 --> 00:12:38.340
<v 0>Now that the comings were defeated, the Scots rallied to the Bruce in droves.</v>

225
00:12:38.460 --> 00:12:41.190
It was time to take on the English, still occupied.

226
00:12:41.220 --> 00:12:44.460
Most of the South of Scotland over the course of 10 years of war.

227
00:12:44.550 --> 00:12:47.670
Robert had noticed a pattern in the English campaigns in Scotland.

228
00:12:47.790 --> 00:12:51.060
They would invade in the spring and then they'd leave again in the winter

229
00:12:51.090 --> 00:12:55.440
leaving causals relatively lightly garrisons do secure their foothold for the

230
00:12:55.441 --> 00:12:56.670
next spring's campaign.

231
00:12:56.700 --> 00:13:01.230
So he decided on a novel strategy for the time when the English armies invaded,

232
00:13:01.231 --> 00:13:05.460
he refused to go out and find them melting his army into the Hills and engaging

233
00:13:05.461 --> 00:13:08.340
in guerrilla style warfare though. It wasn't called that at the time.

234
00:13:08.550 --> 00:13:12.240
Then when the English left and Lexi oceans hired going back out,

235
00:13:12.360 --> 00:13:16.880
Robert came down from the Hills and attack their councils from 1309 to 1313.

236
00:13:16.890 --> 00:13:17.723
Using this method,

237
00:13:17.880 --> 00:13:21.870
he took one English fortress after another pushing the English systematically

238
00:13:21.871 --> 00:13:26.370
out of the country without ever fighting them in open battle. In 13, 14,

239
00:13:26.400 --> 00:13:30.540
the only major castle left and English hands in Scotland was Sterling and

240
00:13:30.900 --> 00:13:32.520
Robin's brother Edward leaves each to it.

241
00:13:33.090 --> 00:13:37.110
Robin now felt secure enough in his power that he issued a proclamation that any

242
00:13:37.111 --> 00:13:41.730
noble in Scotland who hadn't yet acknowledged him as King of Scots would lose

243
00:13:41.790 --> 00:13:44.670
their lands. In one year's time. Meanwhile,

244
00:13:44.671 --> 00:13:46.740
the commander of the English Garrison at Sterling,

245
00:13:47.100 --> 00:13:50.220
Phillip Melbray recognizing the hopelessness of his position,

246
00:13:50.340 --> 00:13:52.110
made an agreement with Edward Bruce,

247
00:13:52.111 --> 00:13:56.850
that unless he was relieved by June the 24th, he would surrender the castle.

248
00:14:03.120 --> 00:14:05.880
If Sterling was lost, the English would lose and you control.

249
00:14:05.881 --> 00:14:08.010
They had left in Scotland. So Edward,

250
00:14:08.011 --> 00:14:12.120
the second's long distracted by squabbles with his own ability, decided to act.

251
00:14:12.180 --> 00:14:14.070
He raised a massive army for the time,

252
00:14:14.190 --> 00:14:19.110
15 to 20,000 men and headed North into Scotland to attempt to relieve Sterling.

253
00:14:19.140 --> 00:14:23.550
Robert recognizing this, everything had done so far could be undone by this.

254
00:14:23.700 --> 00:14:26.760
He knew he had to stop Edward before he reached Sterling.

255
00:14:26.940 --> 00:14:30.420
He marched his army about half the size of the English to a position,

256
00:14:30.450 --> 00:14:33.270
a few miles South of Sterling near the bannock burn,

257
00:14:33.480 --> 00:14:35.850
fast flowing stream on June the 23rd,

258
00:14:35.851 --> 00:14:39.540
the English arrived and advanced screen of cavalry came upon one of the Scottish

259
00:14:39.980 --> 00:14:42.930
scriptural informations. They defensive darlings of pikeman.

260
00:14:42.931 --> 00:14:46.770
That was the typical Scottish battle formation blocking the road to Sterling

261
00:14:47.040 --> 00:14:50.190
King. Robert was with them rallying his troops one English night,

262
00:14:50.280 --> 00:14:54.110
Henry to Bowen charged at the King and challenged him to single combat.

263
00:14:54.170 --> 00:14:58.010
This was the kind of thing Robert, the Bruce relish. So in spite of the danger,

264
00:14:58.220 --> 00:15:02.210
he accepted King Robert dodged a burns lawns and split the young Knight's head

265
00:15:02.211 --> 00:15:04.430
open with his battle ax killing him instantly.

266
00:15:04.640 --> 00:15:08.480
The only thing Robert would say about the fight later was that he was upset that

267
00:15:08.540 --> 00:15:11.450
he had broken his favorite tax. The English cavalry commodity,

268
00:15:11.480 --> 00:15:15.620
the olive Hereford had just witnessed his nephew being slain by the Scottish

269
00:15:15.650 --> 00:15:16.760
King enraged.

270
00:15:16.761 --> 00:15:20.240
He attacks the Scottish infantry unaware that had been led into a trap.

271
00:15:20.270 --> 00:15:24.170
The grounds around the road had been dotted with pit traps covered by branches

272
00:15:24.171 --> 00:15:28.100
so that when the English cavalry trying to spread out into an attack formation,

273
00:15:28.280 --> 00:15:31.010
dozens of men and horses suddenly disappeared.

274
00:15:31.011 --> 00:15:33.710
Falling into pits with wooden stakes planted the bottom.

275
00:15:33.920 --> 00:15:36.800
Then the scripture information of the Scott's advanced killing.

276
00:15:36.920 --> 00:15:40.970
Many of the tightly packed English horseman who had no room to maneuver Hereford

277
00:15:41.000 --> 00:15:42.710
was forced to retreat. Meanwhile,

278
00:15:42.830 --> 00:15:46.640
an attempt by another contingent of English cavalry to and circle the Scottish

279
00:15:46.670 --> 00:15:49.940
position was opposed by the other part of Robert's army.

280
00:15:50.090 --> 00:15:53.210
And the English were again compelled to retreat. The volunteers,

281
00:15:53.240 --> 00:15:54.320
English heavy cavalry,

282
00:15:54.380 --> 00:15:59.000
the Kings of the medieval battlefield had been defeated by peasant infantryman,

283
00:15:59.210 --> 00:16:00.350
armed with Spears.

284
00:16:00.470 --> 00:16:03.560
The English morale took a huge dip at the end of the first days,

285
00:16:04.070 --> 00:16:07.160
battled a Scottish nights in the English army Alexander satin,

286
00:16:07.310 --> 00:16:10.970
deserted to the sconce during the night and told Robert he should attack the

287
00:16:10.971 --> 00:16:12.650
demoralized English. The next day,

288
00:16:12.680 --> 00:16:16.460
June the 24th dawns and King Edward began forming his lines to charge the

289
00:16:16.461 --> 00:16:20.300
Scottish position in the woods in front of him considerably more cautious than

290
00:16:20.301 --> 00:16:22.010
the day before then to his surprise.

291
00:16:22.011 --> 00:16:25.460
The Scottish infantry began emerging from the woods and marching towards the

292
00:16:25.461 --> 00:16:27.320
English position across the open field.

293
00:16:27.380 --> 00:16:30.620
It seemed suicidal than the arguments on the English side.

294
00:16:30.620 --> 00:16:32.810
Wasn't whether it's a challenge to the sculpts or not,

295
00:16:32.840 --> 00:16:35.210
but who would have the honor of leading the attack?

296
00:16:35.270 --> 00:16:38.720
The isle of Gloucester who had been accused of calendars by King Edward for

297
00:16:38.840 --> 00:16:42.290
suggesting the battle we postponed at one point was determined to win glory for

298
00:16:42.291 --> 00:16:44.720
himself and charged accompanied. By many nights,

299
00:16:44.810 --> 00:16:48.530
they ran right into the Scottish skill rung who instead of giving weight stood

300
00:16:48.531 --> 00:16:52.160
fast and the cavalry was impaled on the long Pikes Gloucester.

301
00:16:52.161 --> 00:16:54.890
And most of his contingence were dead within minutes.

302
00:16:55.370 --> 00:16:58.880
Edwards now ordered a general advance English understanding of Scottish tactics

303
00:16:58.881 --> 00:17:03.200
was that the children was a defensive formation and last it wasn't mobile.

304
00:17:03.201 --> 00:17:06.260
When the troops started to March, the formation would break up,

305
00:17:06.440 --> 00:17:10.160
but the Bruce had trained his infantry to use the shelter on as an offensive,

306
00:17:10.161 --> 00:17:12.620
as well as a defensive formation. Once again,

307
00:17:12.621 --> 00:17:14.540
when the English cavalry charged the scopes,

308
00:17:14.550 --> 00:17:18.260
they were maps by a wall of Spears that stops their attack. Coles,

309
00:17:18.470 --> 00:17:20.930
the English archers, you might've been able to break up.

310
00:17:20.931 --> 00:17:22.670
The Scottish formations were ineffective.

311
00:17:22.760 --> 00:17:26.510
The cavalry mounted on that toll charges were in the line of fire and the

312
00:17:26.930 --> 00:17:29.330
archers have to stop after they started hitting their own men.

313
00:17:29.540 --> 00:17:31.460
The Scottish infantry pushed the English back,

314
00:17:31.490 --> 00:17:35.780
trapping them between the bannock burn on one side and the Pell stream on the

315
00:17:35.781 --> 00:17:39.320
other. The cavalry had nowhere to maneuver and began to break ranks,

316
00:17:39.470 --> 00:17:43.250
deciding that the battle was lost and would flat along with 500 roll bodyguards.

317
00:17:43.280 --> 00:17:47.270
This triggered the collapse of the entire English army into a chaotic route.

318
00:17:47.420 --> 00:17:51.690
It is estimated this over 10,000 English soldiers were killed during the battle

319
00:17:51.810 --> 00:17:55.530
and the retreats back into England, fewer than 5,000 meters,

320
00:17:55.531 --> 00:17:56.700
South of Scotland alive.

321
00:17:56.790 --> 00:17:59.610
It was the greatest triumph in Scottish military history.

322
00:18:05.780 --> 00:18:06.410
<v 1>[Inaudible].</v>

323
00:18:06.410 --> 00:18:08.600
<v 0>For the English Nobles. He captured a Bannockburn.</v>

324
00:18:08.840 --> 00:18:11.420
Robin negotiated the release of his wife, daughter and sisters.

325
00:18:11.421 --> 00:18:12.860
After eight years of captivity,

326
00:18:13.010 --> 00:18:17.000
Sterling castle quickly fell and all of Scotland's now belong to the Bruce.

327
00:18:17.060 --> 00:18:20.810
Now the Scots were the ones conducting raids into Northern England's and even

328
00:18:20.820 --> 00:18:22.700
mounted a serious invasion of islands,

329
00:18:22.701 --> 00:18:26.270
which lasted for years before they were defeated in 1318.

330
00:18:26.510 --> 00:18:31.130
The only thing Linds continued until 1327 when Edward the second was deposed by

331
00:18:31.131 --> 00:18:35.150
his wife, Isabella and their 14 year old son was crowns Edward. The third,

332
00:18:35.360 --> 00:18:39.110
Robert forced the issue by attacking Northern England and defeated the young

333
00:18:39.440 --> 00:18:43.550
Edward at the battle of Stan hope park on August the fourth, 1327. Finally,

334
00:18:43.551 --> 00:18:46.790
the English were forced to the bargaining table and Robert and Edward signed the

335
00:18:46.791 --> 00:18:49.610
treaty of added Brown North Hampton in 1328.

336
00:18:49.670 --> 00:18:51.530
The English formally recognized Robert,

337
00:18:51.531 --> 00:18:55.310
the Bruce as King of Scotland's and renounced all claims of over Lordship to the

338
00:18:55.311 --> 00:18:56.450
country, the war,

339
00:18:56.480 --> 00:19:00.320
which had consumed Robert's entire adult life was finally over,

340
00:19:00.590 --> 00:19:01.490
around the same time.

341
00:19:01.490 --> 00:19:05.210
The Pope lifted the order of excommunication against Robert from over 20 years

342
00:19:05.211 --> 00:19:06.980
before. But unfortunately for the Bruce,

343
00:19:07.250 --> 00:19:08.930
he wasn't able to enjoy the peace for long.

344
00:19:09.020 --> 00:19:12.230
A lifetime of campaigning had taken its toll on the King and he grew well in

345
00:19:12.231 --> 00:19:16.370
1327 with an unknown illness, possibly leprosy or tuberculosis.

346
00:19:16.430 --> 00:19:20.840
The illness blamed his life on June the seventh, 1329 at the age of 54,

347
00:19:20.900 --> 00:19:21.681
his five-year son,

348
00:19:21.681 --> 00:19:25.370
David succeeded him to the throne of Scotland and had a turbulent rain,

349
00:19:25.371 --> 00:19:29.360
but it was his grandson, Robert the seconds, the son of the Bruce's daughter,

350
00:19:29.361 --> 00:19:32.450
Marjorie who had the lasting impact on history. Robert,

351
00:19:32.451 --> 00:19:34.910
the second was the first King of the house of stewards that would rule

352
00:19:35.390 --> 00:19:37.190
Scotland's for over 300 years. Intel James,

353
00:19:37.191 --> 00:19:41.540
the sixth of Scotland was also crowned King of England in 1603, 100 years later,

354
00:19:41.570 --> 00:19:45.110
the two countries were formally joined together as the kingdom of great Britain

355
00:19:45.260 --> 00:19:46.280
today, queen Elizabeth,

356
00:19:46.281 --> 00:19:49.160
the second can trace her ancestry all the way back to Robert,

357
00:19:49.161 --> 00:19:51.980
the Bruce who has had 19th great grandfather.

358
00:19:52.220 --> 00:19:55.970
It is interesting to note that despite all of the English attempts to subjugate

359
00:19:56.510 --> 00:19:58.340
Scotland's in the 13th and 14th centuries,

360
00:19:58.550 --> 00:20:02.630
it ended up being a Scot that sat on the throne of England and unified the two

361
00:20:02.631 --> 00:20:03.560
countries that way.

362
00:20:03.590 --> 00:20:07.370
But we're sure that's just the way Robert the Bruce would have wanted it.

363
00:20:07.730 --> 00:20:09.620
