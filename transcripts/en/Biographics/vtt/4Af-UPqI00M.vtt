00:00:22.610 --> 00:00:27.530
1961 Baikonur Cosmodrome in what is now cans done picked up a transmission

9
00:00:27.710 --> 00:00:31.490
that changed human history. I can see the clouds.

10
00:00:31.640 --> 00:00:34.190
I can see everything it's beautiful.

11
00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:36.890
Spoken in a youthful Russian voice.

12
00:00:36.891 --> 00:00:41.600
Those words came from a place no human had ever gone before sat

13
00:00:41.601 --> 00:00:45.470
327 kilometers above the surface. All over the earth.

14
00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:50.510
Yuri Gagarin had just become the first man to ever visit space outside

15
00:00:50.511 --> 00:00:51.051
his window.

16
00:00:51.051 --> 00:00:55.040
Our planet hung brilliance blue against the cold darkness of the universe.

17
00:00:55.310 --> 00:00:56.390
Thanks to this one.

18
00:00:56.450 --> 00:01:01.250
Russian pilot mankind would now have a whole new frontier to explore a

19
00:01:01.251 --> 00:01:06.050
frontier. We're still trying to tame six decades later today.

20
00:01:06.110 --> 00:01:09.860
The name Yuri Gagarin remains world famous up there,

21
00:01:09.890 --> 00:01:14.090
right alongside the alarm strong in terms of amazing firsts,

22
00:01:14.120 --> 00:01:16.520
but who really was this Soviet space, man.

23
00:01:16.521 --> 00:01:19.700
And how did he come to be sitting in that capsule?

24
00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:24.140
Born into a poor peasant family on the Eve of world war two Gagarin could have

25
00:01:24.170 --> 00:01:28.340
easily never amounted to much, but thanks to the sheer force of his talent.

26
00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:33.170
He wound up changing history in the video today biographics is stepping into its

27
00:01:33.770 --> 00:01:38.420
Soyuz and aiming for the stars as we uncover the life of the very

28
00:01:38.421 --> 00:01:39.650
first space. Man,

29
00:01:45.800 --> 00:01:50.720
If you were picking a time and place in which to be born 1934

30
00:01:50.721 --> 00:01:54.950
and pushy, no would probably be pretty far down your list.

31
00:01:54.980 --> 00:01:58.550
That's because Koshino is a pole in the gin, Western Russia,

32
00:01:58.780 --> 00:02:01.100
those sort of place where hens room,

33
00:02:01.101 --> 00:02:05.390
the streets and living in a weathered wooden shack is practically a

34
00:02:05.420 --> 00:02:06.230
luxury.

35
00:02:06.230 --> 00:02:10.520
But it's also because Cascina at this particular point in time was undergoing a

36
00:02:10.521 --> 00:02:13.040
painful decade in 1934,

37
00:02:13.041 --> 00:02:17.270
the Soviet countryside was already in the throws of a Stalinist

38
00:02:17.300 --> 00:02:22.040
agricultural shakeup that resulted in a whole ton of poverty and

39
00:02:22.041 --> 00:02:23.930
famine. And just a few years,

40
00:02:23.960 --> 00:02:27.650
it would be shaken up even harder when Nazi Germany invaded.

41
00:02:27.950 --> 00:02:31.610
But we are getting ahead of ourselves for now.

42
00:02:31.640 --> 00:02:33.050
Just know that when you're ready,

43
00:02:33.051 --> 00:02:36.920
Gagarin was born in Kachina on March the ninth, 1934.

44
00:02:36.921 --> 00:02:41.480
It wasn't into circumstances that screams he's going to be great.

45
00:02:41.600 --> 00:02:45.740
The third of four children Gagarin was the son of a carpenter and the milkmaids

46
00:02:45.770 --> 00:02:49.160
both of whom worked on a nearby collective farm.

47
00:02:49.460 --> 00:02:51.230
This being Soviet or Russia,

48
00:02:51.290 --> 00:02:55.910
VAT mens doing backbreaking work for a pittance while wallowing in poverty.

49
00:02:56.000 --> 00:03:00.880
It's been suggested that the reason the garden never grew the 157 centimeters,

50
00:03:01.210 --> 00:03:06.100
five foot two in old money, it was down to childhood malnutrition. You had to,

51
00:03:06.101 --> 00:03:07.830
despite this unpromising star,

52
00:03:07.900 --> 00:03:11.680
the boy URI seems to have been relatively content. One feature,

53
00:03:11.710 --> 00:03:15.430
everyone who encountered him seems to remember is that he was always smiling,

54
00:03:15.550 --> 00:03:20.050
a big open smile. That would one day when him friends across the globe,

55
00:03:20.260 --> 00:03:25.210
but first the boy would have to survive a period in which there was very

56
00:03:25.211 --> 00:03:28.750
little to smile about on the 22nd of June, 1941,

57
00:03:28.751 --> 00:03:30.640
when Gagarin was only seven Nazi,

58
00:03:30.641 --> 00:03:34.420
Germany launched a surprise invasion of the Soviet union for the first couple of

59
00:03:34.421 --> 00:03:39.400
years of world war two, Hitler and Stalin had been allies. But now as pans,

60
00:03:39.490 --> 00:03:42.760
the tanks rolled across the flat grasslands of Ukraine,

61
00:03:42.940 --> 00:03:47.920
better reuse and Russia. All the hatred between the two came bubbling out.

62
00:03:48.070 --> 00:03:50.530
When the German front lines reached casino,

63
00:03:50.740 --> 00:03:53.770
the Nazis through the Gar and family out of their home,

64
00:03:53.890 --> 00:03:55.810
forcing them to build a mud hot EMyth,

65
00:03:55.830 --> 00:03:58.210
three meters square and live in your gardens.

66
00:03:58.211 --> 00:04:02.380
Two oldest siblings were arrested and sent to slave labor camps in Poland when

67
00:04:02.381 --> 00:04:06.400
Gagarin and his younger brother bars were caught trying to sabotage German

68
00:04:06.401 --> 00:04:10.990
vehicles by sticking potatoes up that tailpipes and enraged soldier tried to

69
00:04:10.991 --> 00:04:12.430
hang bar us from an Apple tree.

70
00:04:12.530 --> 00:04:16.240
It was only when Gagarin's parents begs on their knees for their five-year-old

71
00:04:16.570 --> 00:04:19.000
son's life that the Nazis relented, yes,

72
00:04:19.060 --> 00:04:22.630
even amid the apocalyptic horrors of life on the Eastern front,

73
00:04:22.780 --> 00:04:25.990
your still managed to find inspiration. One clear day,

74
00:04:25.991 --> 00:04:28.450
a pair of German Messerschmitts engaged,

75
00:04:28.451 --> 00:04:31.600
willing to Soviet yaks and a dog fight high above the casino.

76
00:04:31.870 --> 00:04:35.620
One Nazi plane was destroyed in the fight while one of the yaks was shut down

77
00:04:36.050 --> 00:04:37.210
bugs. The rest of the villages.

78
00:04:37.211 --> 00:04:40.540
Seven-year-old Gagarin rushed to help the down Soviet Hammond.

79
00:04:40.570 --> 00:04:42.670
But when he reached him, the boy couldn't move.

80
00:04:42.940 --> 00:04:46.240
Couldn't do anything but stare at this impossible, man,

81
00:04:46.241 --> 00:04:47.830
who'd fallen out of the sky.

82
00:04:47.920 --> 00:04:52.360
It said that this was the moment when Eureka Gar in first decided to become a

83
00:04:52.361 --> 00:04:54.970
pilot. Finally in 1945,

84
00:04:54.971 --> 00:04:59.350
Germany was defeated and peace was declared in Europe in the aftermath of the

85
00:04:59.351 --> 00:05:00.280
Nazi occupation.

86
00:05:00.910 --> 00:05:04.840
Garden's dad decided to move the entire household to the town of [inaudible].

87
00:05:04.900 --> 00:05:08.710
It was literal. Mr. Gagarin sought up the family's wooden shack,

88
00:05:08.740 --> 00:05:10.360
transported it bit by bit,

89
00:05:10.510 --> 00:05:14.200
took his hat and rebuilt it by hand for them to live in.

90
00:05:14.410 --> 00:05:18.910
It would be from this humble reconstructed shack on the fringes of this

91
00:05:18.911 --> 00:05:23.110
anonymous town that Eureka Gar in which truly began his journey to the center.

92
00:05:29.850 --> 00:05:30.660
<v 2>Compared to the.</v>

93
00:05:30.660 --> 00:05:34.590
<v 0>Deprivation of casino, because hot school is practically a paradise.</v>

94
00:05:34.830 --> 00:05:36.900
There was work for gardens parents,

95
00:05:36.960 --> 00:05:40.230
a sizeable school where URI could make friends and meet girls.

96
00:05:40.560 --> 00:05:42.540
There was also an aviation club.

97
00:05:42.570 --> 00:05:46.560
The teenager joined where he learns all about aircraft disciplining to being too

98
00:05:46.561 --> 00:05:50.100
young, to fly. Not that he yet seems like pilot material.

99
00:05:50.160 --> 00:05:54.390
When Gagarin left school at 16, it wasn't to enroll in the air forces.

100
00:05:54.420 --> 00:05:58.130
It was to train, to be a Foundry man, a decent enough in the USSR,

101
00:05:58.131 --> 00:06:01.070
but not one that usually leads to a YouTube channel in the far future.

102
00:06:01.071 --> 00:06:05.870
Doing videos about you Gagarin's who must have sensed that this was a dead

103
00:06:05.871 --> 00:06:08.120
end after a single year in 1951,

104
00:06:08.121 --> 00:06:11.030
he transferred away from his studies away from his family,

105
00:06:11.180 --> 00:06:15.650
all the way down to the Bren's new technical school in Saratov.

106
00:06:15.770 --> 00:06:18.470
Supposedly he was there to study tractors.

107
00:06:18.620 --> 00:06:21.950
But where are you to ask the teenage Gagarin? Anything about them?

108
00:06:22.190 --> 00:06:26.480
It have probably just given you one of his trademarks shy smiles that's because

109
00:06:26.481 --> 00:06:29.270
Gagarin was really in Saratoga. For one reason,

110
00:06:29.360 --> 00:06:31.670
the schools shiny new flight club,

111
00:06:31.850 --> 00:06:36.050
unlike the aviation club in Kusatsu because the bigger one down in Saratov

112
00:06:36.051 --> 00:06:40.070
really did allow it students to fly planes for the first time in his life.

113
00:06:40.071 --> 00:06:43.910
Yuri Gagarin took to the skies on border yak. 18. Looking back later,

114
00:06:43.970 --> 00:06:48.710
he would say that fluent fills me with pride and gave meaning to my whole

115
00:06:48.711 --> 00:06:50.270
life. In 1955,

116
00:06:50.330 --> 00:06:55.190
age 21 Gagarin enrolled in the pilot school and arm back the mid fifties,

117
00:06:55.300 --> 00:06:57.830
a time of great change in the USSR.

118
00:06:57.920 --> 00:07:01.100
Two years before Stalin had died in just one more year,

119
00:07:01.120 --> 00:07:03.950
Nikita Khrushchev would make his secret speech.

120
00:07:03.980 --> 00:07:07.550
Beginning of Thor that would see long lost freedoms regained.

121
00:07:07.700 --> 00:07:10.310
Maybe it was the mood in the entire nation,

122
00:07:10.311 --> 00:07:13.460
but Gagarin seems to have blossomed in R and Berg.

123
00:07:13.610 --> 00:07:16.940
It was well upon at school that he met Valentina Gorev.

124
00:07:17.390 --> 00:07:21.830
And so turns heads that she fell off of him without ever really knowing why it

125
00:07:21.831 --> 00:07:26.630
was there to garenne took his first solo flight and MIG 15 jet an experience

126
00:07:26.631 --> 00:07:31.040
that made even his Virgin flight in the yak. 18 appear trivial by 1957.

127
00:07:31.550 --> 00:07:34.340
Gagarin was lucky in love and cruising through his studies.

128
00:07:34.430 --> 00:07:37.880
He was recognized as a brilliant pilot, despite his short stature,

129
00:07:37.910 --> 00:07:41.060
meaning that you have to sit at top of cushion to see out of the cockpit.

130
00:07:41.210 --> 00:07:46.130
And this was perfect timing because 1957 was when mankind finally began looking

131
00:07:46.131 --> 00:07:47.690
upward on August the 21st,

132
00:07:47.691 --> 00:07:52.070
the world's first Intercontinental ballistic missile was launched in the USSR

133
00:07:52.100 --> 00:07:54.830
designs, Boeing, the ultra secretive rocket genius,

134
00:07:54.831 --> 00:07:57.230
Sergei Korolev the all seven SIM Yorker.

135
00:07:57.231 --> 00:08:02.030
It was a breakthrough in weapons technology that left the USA eating Soviet

136
00:08:02.031 --> 00:08:06.380
dust. But while Moscow loved the [inaudible] for its offensive capabilities,

137
00:08:07.100 --> 00:08:10.550
Carla wanted to use it to expand mankind's horizons.

138
00:08:10.640 --> 00:08:14.450
That's October another car that rockets blast it off from the bike and will

139
00:08:14.451 --> 00:08:18.470
launchpad in what is now Kazakhstan, but rather than carrying a warhead,

140
00:08:18.650 --> 00:08:22.520
it was carrying a small metal lobe. The size of a beach bowl,

141
00:08:22.640 --> 00:08:26.390
venting Sputnik one became the first man-made satellite in orbit.

142
00:08:26.540 --> 00:08:31.520
It was a moment that changed everything, marking the Dawn of the space age,

143
00:08:31.550 --> 00:08:35.830
but Korolev wasn't done yet. He sent another goal one. So secrets,

144
00:08:35.831 --> 00:08:39.950
so preposterous that only a handful of people knew about it.

145
00:08:40.670 --> 00:08:43.670
Karlov wanted to send a man to space.

146
00:08:43.820 --> 00:08:48.620
It was this impossible dream that would soon transform Yuri Gagarin's life.

147
00:08:55.080 --> 00:08:56.460
<v 3>Two years off to Sputnik's.</v>

148
00:08:56.460 --> 00:09:01.200
<v 0>Launch in October of 1955 groups of mysterious recruiters began fanning out</v>

149
00:09:01.201 --> 00:09:04.080
across the USSR, looking for pilots by now,

150
00:09:04.530 --> 00:09:08.580
Erica garenne was a leftenant in the Soviet air forces based in Chile,

151
00:09:08.610 --> 00:09:10.560
Murmansk in the Arctic circle.

152
00:09:10.620 --> 00:09:15.030
He ends Valentina had married three weeks off to Sputnik's launch and their

153
00:09:15.031 --> 00:09:17.610
lives were now as good as that ever dream.

154
00:09:18.110 --> 00:09:22.010
Then these mysterious recruiters came knocking a garden, his base,

155
00:09:22.011 --> 00:09:26.540
and everything was just turned upside down alongside his comrades.

156
00:09:26.541 --> 00:09:30.500
Gagarin was subjected to a battery of tests, physical and his mental.

157
00:09:30.650 --> 00:09:34.670
There was so strenuous few could pass them. When those tests were done,

158
00:09:34.700 --> 00:09:37.250
the successful pilots were sent to Bert Danco,

159
00:09:37.251 --> 00:09:40.760
military hospital in Moscow where Gagarin Lacy recalled.

160
00:09:41.030 --> 00:09:42.860
They tapped our bodies with hammers,

161
00:09:43.010 --> 00:09:47.240
twisted us about on special devices and checks the vestibular organs in our

162
00:09:47.300 --> 00:09:50.480
ears. They tested us from head to toe.

163
00:09:50.660 --> 00:09:55.580
By the time the tests were over only 20 pilots remained 20 pilots from across

164
00:09:55.581 --> 00:09:59.720
the USSR, the creme de LA creme of Soviet Hammond ship.

165
00:09:59.780 --> 00:10:03.800
It was now clear to the remaining pilots. What all of this was about.

166
00:10:04.070 --> 00:10:08.870
They weren't in the running to be the first ever cosmonaut shortly after passing

167
00:10:08.871 --> 00:10:12.650
his medical Gagarin and Valentina left behind their cold,

168
00:10:12.651 --> 00:10:17.360
comfortable lives and Murmansk and transferred to one of the most secretive

169
00:10:17.361 --> 00:10:19.700
towns in Russia. Star city,

170
00:10:20.180 --> 00:10:24.830
a closed down star city was a place of luxury unparalleled even in Moscow with

171
00:10:24.950 --> 00:10:27.680
well-stocked shops and vast apartments.

172
00:10:27.710 --> 00:10:30.680
But while life installs may have been luxurious,

173
00:10:30.980 --> 00:10:34.700
it was also tough off as the first astronaut training program in the world.

174
00:10:34.720 --> 00:10:38.630
America was still dicking about with chimpanzees at this stage star city's

175
00:10:38.631 --> 00:10:41.330
trials pushed the 20 pilots to that limits.

176
00:10:41.390 --> 00:10:44.030
They endeared G-forces even seasoned.

177
00:10:44.060 --> 00:10:46.850
Pilots had never experienced underwent physical tests.

178
00:10:46.880 --> 00:10:49.220
So rigorous that most dropped out.

179
00:10:49.460 --> 00:10:54.020
Eventually only six remained all of them. Short men, apparently call-off off,

180
00:10:54.021 --> 00:10:55.640
had gone and built a capsule. So small,

181
00:10:55.850 --> 00:10:58.730
new average size man could dream of fitting inside.

182
00:10:58.940 --> 00:11:03.620
I'd lost those six short men became to Yuri Gagarin and

183
00:11:03.650 --> 00:11:08.120
gum and T 12. Gagarin was convinced that Tito would be the one chosen,

184
00:11:08.150 --> 00:11:11.390
possibly the best pilot in the U S I saw he was intense,

185
00:11:11.510 --> 00:11:14.600
athletic and educated in another time in another,

186
00:11:14.720 --> 00:11:19.490
the place he likely would have gotten the job, but this one, the Soviet union,

187
00:11:19.730 --> 00:11:23.930
the work is paradise. When word got to Nikita Khrushchev himself,

188
00:11:23.931 --> 00:11:26.270
the son of peasants that the choice had come down,

189
00:11:26.510 --> 00:11:29.720
do a poor boy from the sticks and a middle-class intellectual.

190
00:11:29.780 --> 00:11:33.860
He supposedly told Korolev to forget teach off the first man.

191
00:11:34.120 --> 00:11:36.350
And the space would be Yuri Gagarin.

192
00:11:36.530 --> 00:11:40.760
By the time we had reached the two pilots that decamped to Baikonur Cosmodrome

193
00:11:40.761 --> 00:11:45.050
on the vast planes of the Catholic step to prepare for the launch,

194
00:11:45.110 --> 00:11:48.770
how exactly detailed took the news is a matter of some debate.

195
00:11:48.860 --> 00:11:52.520
Although all accounts say he was outraged at the time, some claim,

196
00:11:52.550 --> 00:11:54.850
he found peace with the snob in later life,

197
00:11:54.851 --> 00:11:59.110
while others say he died still bitter at being robbed of his place in the

198
00:11:59.111 --> 00:12:02.410
history books, either way on April the 12th, 1961,

199
00:12:02.411 --> 00:12:06.040
it was good guardian who got out of bed, knowing he had a date with destiny.

200
00:12:06.130 --> 00:12:08.740
Now, he might've been a bit nervous that morning, but you know what?

201
00:12:08.741 --> 00:12:12.730
You don't have to be nervous about your passwords leaking out there on the

202
00:12:12.731 --> 00:12:16.210
internet. If you use Dashlane, who is today's sponsor,

203
00:12:16.300 --> 00:12:20.740
Dashlane is a one-stop shop for all of your digital identity protection

204
00:12:20.741 --> 00:12:25.210
needs. If all your passwords are the same, that's a bad idea.

205
00:12:25.360 --> 00:12:28.600
You can use dash password manage it's create insecurity,

206
00:12:28.601 --> 00:12:30.550
store complex and unique passwords,

207
00:12:30.551 --> 00:12:34.540
making it less likely that your accounts are going to get compromised with

208
00:12:34.900 --> 00:12:34.990
Daschle.

209
00:12:34.990 --> 00:12:38.080
And you didn't have to spend time resetting passwords or filling out tedious

210
00:12:38.081 --> 00:12:42.670
forms and financial info. It does it for you with the click of a button.

211
00:12:42.730 --> 00:12:45.370
They also have a VPN as part of their service,

212
00:12:45.371 --> 00:12:50.170
meaning that you can browse the internet securely and confidently even on

213
00:12:50.171 --> 00:12:52.600
public wifi. So make your life easier.

214
00:12:52.601 --> 00:12:56.860
I had to dashlane.com forward slash biographics and try dash lane for free on

215
00:12:56.861 --> 00:12:59.470
your first device. And when you decide, you want to upgrade to premium,

216
00:12:59.800 --> 00:13:04.720
use my code biographics to get a discount of 10% on premium,

217
00:13:05.140 --> 00:13:06.520
and let's get back to it.

218
00:13:12.780 --> 00:13:15.960
If your idea of rocket launches comes via Hollywood,

219
00:13:16.170 --> 00:13:18.000
you might be picturing Yuri Gagarin.

220
00:13:18.450 --> 00:13:21.960
Saturn is capsule listening to a countdown before liftoff,

221
00:13:21.990 --> 00:13:24.900
but that's image would be entirely wrong as Korolev thought.

222
00:13:24.901 --> 00:13:28.560
The idea of a countdown absurd American nonsense.

223
00:13:28.770 --> 00:13:32.160
Instead Gagarin said that listening to Russian love songs,

224
00:13:32.580 --> 00:13:35.490
waiting for the final checks to finish that morning,

225
00:13:35.570 --> 00:13:38.700
he had woken up at 5:30 AM to get to the launch pad.

226
00:13:38.970 --> 00:13:42.330
Then he had made time for a quick pee against the back of his bus.

227
00:13:42.331 --> 00:13:46.500
A bit of necessary business that every future cosmonaut would repeat in the

228
00:13:46.501 --> 00:13:49.230
hopes of getting some of good gardens. Good luck.

229
00:13:49.290 --> 00:13:52.860
Now a good garden was sabotage, but gigantic missiles pointed at the stars.

230
00:13:53.070 --> 00:13:57.990
Not knowing whether death or destiny awaited him at exactly 9:06 AM.

231
00:13:58.590 --> 00:14:00.900
Carla punched the ignition key. There was no warning,

232
00:14:00.990 --> 00:14:02.760
just the sudden jolt of the rocket,

233
00:14:02.761 --> 00:14:06.540
a roar of noise that seems to fill the universe.

234
00:14:06.900 --> 00:14:10.110
And then Yuri Gagarin was blasting upwards,

235
00:14:10.140 --> 00:14:14.160
leaving us behind in a way no human had ever done before.

236
00:14:14.370 --> 00:14:17.850
Although he later claimed to have no memory of it. He was heard screaming,

237
00:14:19.350 --> 00:14:20.490
informal Russian with that,

238
00:14:20.491 --> 00:14:25.260
roughly translates as let's roll a little over 10 minutes later,

239
00:14:25.290 --> 00:14:30.210
the story of humanity had begun its newest chap sat outside the window.

240
00:14:30.920 --> 00:14:35.070
John's swath of bright blue impressed itself on the cosmonauts Ratan retinas.

241
00:14:35.160 --> 00:14:38.760
It was the earth seen for the very first time by humanize,

242
00:14:39.030 --> 00:14:43.350
as it really is a flattened disc flying through nor really

243
00:14:43.950 --> 00:14:47.400
an orb in space, surrounded by endless darkness,

244
00:14:47.520 --> 00:14:51.380
the radio crackles and car Love's voice came on. How are you feeling?

245
00:14:51.500 --> 00:14:55.820
And so you're a Gar in replies with the first words ever said in space,

246
00:14:55.910 --> 00:14:58.790
the flight continues well. The machine is functioning.

247
00:14:58.791 --> 00:15:03.110
Normally reception excellence am carrying out observations of the earth

248
00:15:03.140 --> 00:15:06.920
visibility. Good. I can see the clouds. I can see everything.

249
00:15:07.250 --> 00:15:10.640
And then most poignantly it's beautiful.

250
00:15:11.180 --> 00:15:14.180
What's it lacks in the poetry of one small step for a man,

251
00:15:14.181 --> 00:15:17.750
one giant leap for mankind. It more than made up for, you know,

252
00:15:17.840 --> 00:15:19.790
an estate as good guardian circled.

253
00:15:19.791 --> 00:15:24.530
The se looked down on our welds as no one had seen it before today,

254
00:15:24.560 --> 00:15:26.360
where you stay images of our planet,

255
00:15:26.361 --> 00:15:30.740
taken from space blahzay about the idea that we can pull up a thousand photos of

256
00:15:30.741 --> 00:15:35.360
the earth just by Googling, but try to imagine how urea garden,

257
00:15:35.540 --> 00:15:38.960
the peasant boy from a poor Russian village, Mr. Feld,

258
00:15:39.230 --> 00:15:44.030
try to grasp even the tiniest fragments of how the world

259
00:15:44.150 --> 00:15:48.470
must've appeared to him to say it was likely or inspiring is

260
00:15:49.010 --> 00:15:50.060
almost trite.

261
00:15:50.420 --> 00:15:55.250
You'd probably need to invent whole new words to describe just how garenne

262
00:15:55.251 --> 00:15:58.880
felt at that moment. 108 minutes after launch for stock,

263
00:15:58.881 --> 00:16:01.400
one began it's returned to earth. It was,

264
00:16:01.490 --> 00:16:05.990
he is good garden story almost ended though his capsule meant to

265
00:16:05.991 --> 00:16:10.100
separate, but a cable refused to break. And now he plunged back to earth,

266
00:16:10.101 --> 00:16:12.020
not as a streamlined dot,

267
00:16:12.290 --> 00:16:16.880
but as a tumbling spinning burning bowl of metal in this out of control,

268
00:16:17.270 --> 00:16:20.030
descent, Gagarin, almost lost consciousness, but through sheer luck,

269
00:16:20.240 --> 00:16:22.130
the high temperatures melted the cable,

270
00:16:22.340 --> 00:16:26.960
allowing him to regain control and then eject at the appointed moment at

271
00:16:26.961 --> 00:16:31.940
10:55 AM a Russian peasant woman living on the endless grasslands outside

272
00:16:31.941 --> 00:16:36.800
Gagarin's old student city of Saratov looked up in astonishment as a short

273
00:16:36.801 --> 00:16:40.190
man in an orange suit, floated down toward the earth.

274
00:16:40.400 --> 00:16:44.720
As this stranger landed right by her and removed his helmet and an attacker to

275
00:16:44.721 --> 00:16:48.590
Rover managed to stomach. Have you come from outer space?

276
00:16:48.800 --> 00:16:53.570
Beaming has great wide smile. Yuri Gagarin noted triumphantly.

277
00:16:53.930 --> 00:16:57.830
Yes, he replied what'd you believe it? I said, I certainly have.

278
00:17:04.630 --> 00:17:07.510
The Americans were informed first. They had to be,

279
00:17:07.570 --> 00:17:11.500
nobody wanted Gagarin to be mistaken for a missile into successful flight

280
00:17:11.530 --> 00:17:13.690
accidentally trigger world war three,

281
00:17:13.720 --> 00:17:18.100
but the Soviets made sure it wasn't just Washington. The got the news,

282
00:17:18.160 --> 00:17:22.300
even as good guardian was watching the thrum far up in Vostok. One,

283
00:17:22.360 --> 00:17:26.980
his astounded relatives back home was staring at the sky praying for his safe

284
00:17:26.981 --> 00:17:30.340
return. When it was confirmed, the spacemen had survived. His landing.

285
00:17:30.580 --> 00:17:34.060
The weld went nuts in Moscow crowds poured into the street,

286
00:17:34.061 --> 00:17:35.350
abandoning factories,

287
00:17:35.351 --> 00:17:40.330
offices and schools across the other cities of the Soviet union and across the

288
00:17:40.331 --> 00:17:41.740
Warsaw pact nations.

289
00:17:41.980 --> 00:17:45.460
Then across the non-aligned States and even in the West,

290
00:17:45.461 --> 00:17:48.280
people came together to celebrate this historic event,

291
00:17:48.610 --> 00:17:51.960
perhaps the country where news of Gagarin's flight was received.

292
00:17:51.961 --> 00:17:53.580
Kodaly was the USA.

293
00:17:53.790 --> 00:17:57.900
When NASA's press office was phoned at 4:30 AM by journalists,

294
00:17:58.620 --> 00:18:02.880
Sally spokesman yelled into the phone. What is this? We're all asleep down here.

295
00:18:03.090 --> 00:18:06.090
The headline, the next day, Soviets put man in space.

296
00:18:06.150 --> 00:18:09.000
Spokesman says us asleep within days.

297
00:18:09.030 --> 00:18:12.690
Yuri Gagarin was thrown a lavish parade in Moscow where he was personally

298
00:18:12.691 --> 00:18:17.040
greeted by Nikita Khrushchev often than us. It was onto a world tour and life.

299
00:18:17.100 --> 00:18:19.950
As a living icon, Moscow sent Gagarin all over.

300
00:18:20.010 --> 00:18:24.300
He visited Soviet airlines like Czechoslovakia, Bulgaria, Cuba, and Hungary,

301
00:18:24.480 --> 00:18:28.140
but also capitalist States like Canada, Iceland and great Britain,

302
00:18:28.470 --> 00:18:30.450
but he never made it to America.

303
00:18:30.660 --> 00:18:33.780
Although Gagarin expressed a desire to visit JFK,

304
00:18:33.810 --> 00:18:36.960
banned him from entering the country, but have a sore loser.

305
00:18:36.961 --> 00:18:38.490
It seems the political era,

306
00:18:38.491 --> 00:18:42.780
his plan was to turn the garden into a piece of propaganda or a demonstration of

307
00:18:42.810 --> 00:18:44.310
Soviet superiority,

308
00:18:44.340 --> 00:18:47.970
but their plan quickly hit a fatal bump the garden.

309
00:18:48.300 --> 00:18:49.920
It was just too nice.

310
00:18:50.010 --> 00:18:53.610
Although he was a supporter of the system he lived in Gagarin was mostly

311
00:18:53.640 --> 00:18:56.610
apolitical. It wasn't the kind of going to make speeches,

312
00:18:56.611 --> 00:19:00.660
extolling the value of Soviet tractors or what have you. No,

313
00:19:00.780 --> 00:19:05.730
he was far more likely to just give that wide boyish smile of his crack,

314
00:19:05.731 --> 00:19:09.510
a few jokes and win the hearts of everyone around him in this man.

315
00:19:09.511 --> 00:19:13.380
Who'd seen the stars. Humankind came to see a universal symbol.

316
00:19:13.381 --> 00:19:15.300
Someone who brought them together,

317
00:19:15.360 --> 00:19:20.190
even in the depths of the cold war for Gar in though life as an icon

318
00:19:20.250 --> 00:19:23.670
was pretty hot faced with a parade of celebrations,

319
00:19:23.671 --> 00:19:25.920
honoring him across the planets. He had orbited.

320
00:19:26.250 --> 00:19:30.300
He turned to drink before his flight Gagarin had been borderline Tito, her soul,

321
00:19:30.330 --> 00:19:34.260
not wanting to mess with his flying after landing. He spent half a year,

322
00:19:34.290 --> 00:19:36.150
more or less permanently drunk.

323
00:19:36.330 --> 00:19:40.410
It was a mental state that would cause him to make a dangerous mistake in

324
00:19:40.411 --> 00:19:41.700
September, 1961,

325
00:19:41.730 --> 00:19:46.350
Gagarin was in Crimea for yet more celebration parties sozzled and out of his

326
00:19:46.351 --> 00:19:46.801
mind,

327
00:19:46.801 --> 00:19:50.340
he followed a gorgeous young blondes named Anna back to a hotel room on the

328
00:19:50.341 --> 00:19:54.660
second floor when Valentina burst and the spaceman trying to escape by leaping

329
00:19:54.661 --> 00:19:55.800
out of the nearest window,

330
00:19:55.890 --> 00:19:59.850
only for his foot to catch and send him plunging headlong to us,

331
00:20:00.030 --> 00:20:03.540
the cracked concrete impacted sickeningly against Gagarin's forehead,

332
00:20:03.780 --> 00:20:06.840
leaving him permanently Scott. When he came to the hospital,

333
00:20:06.870 --> 00:20:10.950
his brain was so scrambled. He initially thought I'd never fly again,

334
00:20:11.280 --> 00:20:15.570
but no, the gods were for now still smiling on the form of farm boy,

335
00:20:15.690 --> 00:20:19.890
not long after this Gagarin abandoned his new life as a global celebrity and

336
00:20:20.070 --> 00:20:23.970
returned to working on the Soviet space program. This world of parties,

337
00:20:24.060 --> 00:20:26.460
it wasn't for him. He was still less than 30.

338
00:20:26.700 --> 00:20:30.120
He has infinitely more missions left to fly, infinitely,

339
00:20:30.121 --> 00:20:32.340
more rockets to pilot didn't he.

340
00:20:38.030 --> 00:20:38.630
<v 5>[Inaudible].</v>

341
00:20:38.630 --> 00:20:42.620
<v 0>If Eureka gardens early life was the good side of the Soviet dream plucking a</v>

342
00:20:42.621 --> 00:20:46.160
talented peasant, a farm boy from obscurity and taking them to the stores.

343
00:20:46.460 --> 00:20:50.670
The last of his life showed it's nightmarish side in early

344
00:20:50.671 --> 00:20:51.690
1967,

345
00:20:51.720 --> 00:20:55.950
the new Soviet leader land Brezhnev made it known that he wanted something

346
00:20:55.951 --> 00:20:58.350
spectacular to Mark. 50 years of communism,

347
00:20:58.500 --> 00:21:02.280
the idea was to send up to Sonia's rockets a couple of days apart,

348
00:21:02.430 --> 00:21:06.570
symbolizing Soviet supremacy. First Gagarin was excited.

349
00:21:06.660 --> 00:21:11.250
He pulled some strings and got himself selected as backup pilots, just in cases,

350
00:21:11.251 --> 00:21:13.860
fellow cosmonaut flatten their collar off fat,

351
00:21:13.861 --> 00:21:18.300
Lil butts as the date approach that excitement turns to yeah,

352
00:21:18.510 --> 00:21:23.340
a technical team identifying 203 faults that needed urgent attention garner and

353
00:21:23.540 --> 00:21:26.730
helped them prepare a 10 page report for the leadership at Baikonur to send to

354
00:21:26.731 --> 00:21:29.100
Moscow butts. When the report was finished,

355
00:21:29.250 --> 00:21:31.920
he discovered something truly terrifying.

356
00:21:32.070 --> 00:21:35.580
Everyone was too scared to send it with Brezhnev and charge.

357
00:21:35.730 --> 00:21:40.110
The Soviet system had returned to its crudest ways shooting the messenger was

358
00:21:40.111 --> 00:21:44.460
now practically a sport and no one wanted to be the bearer of bad news.

359
00:21:44.640 --> 00:21:48.570
As the launch date approached Gagarin seems to have realized that getting in the

360
00:21:48.571 --> 00:21:50.790
rocket would be a death sentence.

361
00:21:50.940 --> 00:21:54.800
He begged a KGB friends of his to take the negative report to his superiors.

362
00:21:54.870 --> 00:21:58.770
The friends had lost, agreed, and went to upper command, but he disappeared.

363
00:21:59.010 --> 00:21:59.910
He ends everyone.

364
00:21:59.911 --> 00:22:04.020
Who'd seen the reports will summarily fight or sent to work and humiliating

365
00:22:04.021 --> 00:22:07.430
postings. And they are send of Siberia with rev.

366
00:22:08.040 --> 00:22:11.880
In-charge rocking the boat simply meant that you drowned on the day of the

367
00:22:11.881 --> 00:22:12.270
launch.

368
00:22:12.270 --> 00:22:15.960
Gagarin accompanied calmer off to the rocket pack that Gagarin had a moment of

369
00:22:15.961 --> 00:22:18.930
heroism. It kicked up a massive stink demanding.

370
00:22:18.931 --> 00:22:23.550
He'd be put in that rocket shouting that it was his right as Komaroff superior,

371
00:22:23.610 --> 00:22:26.340
but no Commonwealth didn't fall for it. Instead.

372
00:22:26.341 --> 00:22:28.830
He said goodbye to Gagarin and Clem,

373
00:22:29.130 --> 00:22:33.750
but into his execution chamber Komarov his wife was in the control room and they

374
00:22:33.751 --> 00:22:37.370
spent the minutes before launch saying goodbye over the radio away,

375
00:22:37.410 --> 00:22:38.940
the cosmonaut wasn't coming back.

376
00:22:39.000 --> 00:22:43.140
This unable to do anything to stop this horrific chain of events.

377
00:22:43.440 --> 00:22:46.110
And so on April the 27th, 1967,

378
00:22:46.111 --> 00:22:49.410
Yuri Gagarin was false to stand helpless on the ground.

379
00:22:49.411 --> 00:22:54.210
As the soils carrying his friend failed in Midat reducing vitamin a Culver

380
00:22:54.211 --> 00:22:58.050
off to Ash. The cosmonaut never got over what had happened that day.

381
00:22:58.200 --> 00:23:01.920
The wide smile faded replaced by a more Rouse expression,

382
00:23:02.250 --> 00:23:06.450
openness gateway to depression. Maybe it wouldn't have lasted.

383
00:23:06.780 --> 00:23:10.530
Maybe Gagarin Sunnyside would have returned eventually,

384
00:23:11.100 --> 00:23:16.080
but we'll never know on March the 27th, 1968, 11 months. Exactly.

385
00:23:16.081 --> 00:23:20.550
After calmer offs crash, Gagarin jumped into big 15 for a routine flight.

386
00:23:20.670 --> 00:23:24.330
96 kilometers Northeast of Moscow. He crashed at high speed.

387
00:23:24.540 --> 00:23:27.780
The impact killed Gagarin instantly age, just 34.

388
00:23:27.840 --> 00:23:30.960
The first space man was no more at the time.

389
00:23:30.961 --> 00:23:35.850
There were endless conspiracy theories surrounding Gagarin's death, but in 2013,

390
00:23:36.210 --> 00:23:40.260
formerly classified files were released showing that it was just another case of

391
00:23:40.290 --> 00:23:42.150
Brezhnev era mismanagement.

392
00:23:42.330 --> 00:23:46.370
That same day [inaudible] Jackson accidentally flown too low passing,

393
00:23:46.400 --> 00:23:48.590
incredibly close to garden's mic.

394
00:23:48.740 --> 00:23:52.460
The huge Ashcroft had rolled Gagarin's jet causing it to spin out of control.

395
00:23:52.700 --> 00:23:56.480
Sealing his fate Yuri Gagarin's ashes were into it in the Kremlin will in

396
00:23:56.481 --> 00:23:59.360
Moscow, on March the 30th, 1967,

397
00:23:59.450 --> 00:24:04.040
following a huge Memorial parade shortly after his teenage hometown changed its

398
00:24:04.041 --> 00:24:09.020
name from [inaudible] to Gagarin and his honor today over half a century,

399
00:24:09.021 --> 00:24:10.730
since Gagarin's untimely death,

400
00:24:10.940 --> 00:24:14.810
it can still be hard to fully wrap your head around his achievement while Neil

401
00:24:14.811 --> 00:24:19.040
Armstrong's moonwalk is probably more famous than the West Gagarin's flight was

402
00:24:19.041 --> 00:24:23.180
arguably more impressive. Prior to that spring day in 1961,

403
00:24:23.210 --> 00:24:27.530
no human had ever done anything beyond the confines of our earth.

404
00:24:27.620 --> 00:24:32.570
Every technological revolution, every great Explorer, every brilliant scientist,

405
00:24:32.900 --> 00:24:37.520
all had been limited to this one pale spec and the cosmos,

406
00:24:38.060 --> 00:24:42.680
and then came Eureka garden. The moments, the goals not reached Orbis,

407
00:24:42.770 --> 00:24:46.880
a new horizon opens for humanity. The first man on the moon,

408
00:24:46.910 --> 00:24:47.780
the space shuttle,

409
00:24:48.290 --> 00:24:53.120
the ISS NASA and space X's plans to land a human on Mars.

410
00:24:53.270 --> 00:24:54.890
China's goal of a moon base.

411
00:24:54.891 --> 00:24:59.420
They all STEM from one journey undertaken by this one

412
00:24:59.690 --> 00:25:01.370
hasn't boy from Russia.

413
00:25:01.820 --> 00:25:06.470
The story of humanity's expansion into space may only just be beginning,

414
00:25:06.770 --> 00:25:11.240
but when the history books, uh, finally written in 100, 1000,

415
00:25:11.270 --> 00:25:15.560
even a million years, they will all agree on one thing.

416
00:25:16.010 --> 00:25:20.990
It all started with Yuri Gagarin, the first man in space.

417
00:25:21.680 --> 00:25:23.690
