6
00:00:22.790 --> 00:00:25.950
A peaceful man named town is taken over by an unnamed army.

7
00:00:26.170 --> 00:00:29.950
The invaders arrive by surprise aided by the treason of an insider.

8
00:00:30.170 --> 00:00:32.390
The scheming shopkeeper called coral.

9
00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:36.430
The trader seeks recognition from the new masters and appointments as new mayor,

10
00:00:36.490 --> 00:00:41.340
but he is despised and put to the side by both the occupiers and the town folk,

11
00:00:41.480 --> 00:00:45.420
the locals under the moral leadership of mayor Orden and the town doctor

12
00:00:45.490 --> 00:00:48.660
gradually wear down the morale of their enemies. At first,

13
00:00:48.661 --> 00:00:50.260
they do it with passive resistance,

14
00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:54.140
but this gradually evolves into sabotage and the killing of soldiers.

15
00:00:54.370 --> 00:00:58.620
This is the pop premise of the moon is down a novel by celebrated American

16
00:00:58.621 --> 00:01:01.420
writer. John Steinbeck, the novel was published in 19 four.

17
00:01:01.930 --> 00:01:03.970
Two was an explicit tool of propaganda.

18
00:01:03.971 --> 00:01:08.210
It was translated into several European languages and distributed clandestinely

19
00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:09.770
across occupied Europe,

20
00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:13.130
where it inspired local resistance movements against the axis.

21
00:01:13.180 --> 00:01:16.450
After the walk Incan, the seventh of Norway awarded Steinbeck,

22
00:01:16.610 --> 00:01:20.370
a medal for his service, the moon is down does not mention any location,

23
00:01:20.970 --> 00:01:24.840
Northern nationality of the characters, but the inspiration is clear.

24
00:01:24.980 --> 00:01:29.520
The German occupation of Norway and the man who inspired coral is one of the

25
00:01:29.521 --> 00:01:31.640
most infamous traders of all time.

26
00:01:32.160 --> 00:01:36.000
VI Christing the man who sold his country to the right

27
00:01:42.820 --> 00:01:46.670
Abraham Lawrence Jansen chrisling was born on the 18th of July,

28
00:01:46.990 --> 00:01:50.710
1887 in Telemark Norway, the son of Lutheran minister,

29
00:01:50.870 --> 00:01:54.430
and a well known genealogy. John Lawrence chrisling in his youth,

30
00:01:54.570 --> 00:01:57.710
not interested in continuing the line of eight consecutive pastors.

31
00:01:57.770 --> 00:02:02.350
He decided to join a military academy instead in the 1920s with the rank of

32
00:02:02.351 --> 00:02:06.620
major Christ was sent to Russia as a military attach to the Norwegian embassy

33
00:02:06.621 --> 00:02:10.100
during his mission, he worked with free of Nason a well known Explorer,

34
00:02:10.340 --> 00:02:13.980
diplomat recipient of the Nobel peace prize. The two documented,

35
00:02:13.981 --> 00:02:17.580
the terrible famine gripping the Soviet population as a result of the civil war

36
00:02:17.860 --> 00:02:22.260
and early Londonist reforms. And they also participated in the relief effort.

37
00:02:22.610 --> 00:02:25.450
This experience left a deep impression on him,

38
00:02:25.770 --> 00:02:30.610
a distrust and a fear of communism and the consequences of a mismanaged

39
00:02:30.720 --> 00:02:31.770
socialist state.

40
00:02:31.910 --> 00:02:35.530
He also collaborated with the British helping to mediate with Moscow on behalf

41
00:02:35.531 --> 00:02:38.490
of their interests. And this earned him an appointment as a CBE,

42
00:02:38.650 --> 00:02:42.010
a commander of the order of the British am empire upon returning to Norway

43
00:02:42.410 --> 00:02:45.800
Christing has decided to leave behind the middle career for a political one.

44
00:02:45.940 --> 00:02:49.640
He served with the agrarian party and was appointed defense minister,

45
00:02:49.720 --> 00:02:53.560
a post that he held from 1931 to 1933 in those years,

46
00:02:53.561 --> 00:02:57.360
the great depression did not span Norway as in many other countries in Europe,

47
00:02:57.460 --> 00:03:01.000
the economic crisis brought about the specter of political violence,

48
00:03:01.600 --> 00:03:04.480
ever more fearful of a communist takeover. In June of 1931,

49
00:03:04.880 --> 00:03:08.760
Christing sent the army against a union strike his and the government's

50
00:03:09.280 --> 00:03:11.920
heavy-handed tactics. They did not gain very much support.

51
00:03:12.130 --> 00:03:16.800
Eventually the government it fell in 1933 Christing has ambitions

52
00:03:16.940 --> 00:03:20.630
to create his own party, gain power, looking for inspiration.

53
00:03:20.930 --> 00:03:25.190
He looked to Germany on the 17th of May VI Christing and state attorney Johan

54
00:03:25.990 --> 00:03:30.790
Bera, formerly founded the national Sam or national union. By the way, I,

55
00:03:30.870 --> 00:03:34.430
I haven't apologized yet, but I must hear my Norwegian pronunciation.

56
00:03:34.790 --> 00:03:37.070
I looked them up when I can. It's pretty tough.

57
00:03:37.260 --> 00:03:39.540
This was modeled after the ruling parties in Germany,

58
00:03:39.541 --> 00:03:43.580
initial Italy adopting their trappings members used the Roman salute.

59
00:03:43.690 --> 00:03:48.300
They formed a paramilitary guard called the herd and deck in uniforms dawned

60
00:03:48.301 --> 00:03:52.420
with Eagles. Even the party Lin was a sort of swastika like symbol.

61
00:03:52.760 --> 00:03:55.660
The national union's program was decidedly nationalistic,

62
00:03:55.661 --> 00:03:58.620
and anti-communist it included a total ban on strikes,

63
00:03:58.640 --> 00:04:02.850
the elimination of unemployment and the sterilization of undesirables.

64
00:04:02.860 --> 00:04:07.250
There were three main differences from the Nazi party that had inspired them one

65
00:04:07.251 --> 00:04:11.330
chrisling and the national union never adopted socialism ideology,

66
00:04:11.331 --> 00:04:14.850
which was at least at the roots of the ruling parties in Berlin.

67
00:04:15.070 --> 00:04:19.090
And in Rome two, Christing never made antisemitism a part of his plans.

68
00:04:19.230 --> 00:04:22.640
And three, no national union tried to retain ties with Christianity.

69
00:04:22.770 --> 00:04:24.880
After six months from the foundation,

70
00:04:24.900 --> 00:04:28.480
the national union was put to the test running for parliamentary elections.

71
00:04:28.700 --> 00:04:30.480
It was a total disaster.

72
00:04:30.580 --> 00:04:34.760
The party gained only 2.2% of the vote and got zero seats doing only a little

73
00:04:34.761 --> 00:04:38.480
better than their communist rivals at the following elections. In 1936,

74
00:04:38.481 --> 00:04:42.830
the national union did even worse having alienated much of their C electorate,

75
00:04:43.010 --> 00:04:47.190
but not everything was going wrong for crystalling while attending a conference

76
00:04:47.210 --> 00:04:49.990
in the German port of Lueck, he met Alfred Rosenberg,

77
00:04:50.350 --> 00:04:53.270
beating ideologists and foreign policy advisor to Hitler.

78
00:04:53.300 --> 00:04:56.670
Rosenberg saw some potential in crystalling and introduced him do several

79
00:04:57.270 --> 00:05:00.390
military political top brass in Berlin. And just like that,

80
00:05:00.490 --> 00:05:03.900
the ties with his future masters were being established

81
00:05:10.070 --> 00:05:13.140
After the start of the war in Europe, in September of 1939,

82
00:05:13.200 --> 00:05:16.740
it became very clear to Nazi leadership that for a substantial war effort,

83
00:05:16.890 --> 00:05:19.140
they needed more on and more ships.

84
00:05:19.650 --> 00:05:22.530
This was an opportunity for Norway.

85
00:05:22.930 --> 00:05:25.330
It could offer both in December of 1939,

86
00:05:25.331 --> 00:05:28.050
he returned to Berlin and made a proposal to Rosenberg.

87
00:05:28.190 --> 00:05:30.090
He would stage a KU guitar in Oslo,

88
00:05:30.280 --> 00:05:35.170
install himself as fur of Norway and invite a German landing in support of

89
00:05:35.171 --> 00:05:38.690
the plan chrisling offered to Eric Kridder commander of the creeks Marine

90
00:05:38.920 --> 00:05:42.800
details on Naval agreements between the Norwegian fleet in the British Royal

91
00:05:42.801 --> 00:05:45.560
Navy on the 14th and the 18th of December.

92
00:05:45.561 --> 00:05:49.840
Chrisling met with the fewer himself who granted German military support for his

93
00:05:49.841 --> 00:05:51.240
coup in chrisling schemes.

94
00:05:51.241 --> 00:05:54.000
The German military presence would not be an occupation,

95
00:05:54.020 --> 00:05:57.680
rather a garrisoning of his country to deter an allied landing,

96
00:05:57.870 --> 00:05:58.760
unbeknownst to him,

97
00:05:58.761 --> 00:06:02.280
the German high command intended to take over Norway much earlier than he

98
00:06:02.520 --> 00:06:04.480
expected on the 3rd of April look, 1940,

99
00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:08.320
Christing traveled to Copenhagen for a meeting with German secret services,

100
00:06:08.321 --> 00:06:12.040
during which he handed over even more military intelligence, six days later,

101
00:06:12.110 --> 00:06:15.520
Germany invaded Christing was taken by complete surprise,

102
00:06:15.620 --> 00:06:19.870
but he took some initiative and decided to proceed with this coup seizing the

103
00:06:19.871 --> 00:06:20.870
public radio officers.

104
00:06:20.870 --> 00:06:24.550
He declared himself prime minister and asked for Norwegians do not resist the

105
00:06:24.551 --> 00:06:27.750
Germans who were there to protect the country from an Anglo French invasion.

106
00:06:28.050 --> 00:06:31.350
The invaders immediately recognized his collaborationist government,

107
00:06:31.370 --> 00:06:34.710
but king hack on the seventh of Norway was not of the same opinion.

108
00:06:34.890 --> 00:06:38.300
He declared Quizling's government to be illeg him as and fueled the resistance

109
00:06:38.301 --> 00:06:39.220
against the, their marked,

110
00:06:39.490 --> 00:06:42.740
even after his eventual escape and relocation to Britain.

111
00:06:48.770 --> 00:06:51.860
According to world war II, law, German commander general,

112
00:06:52.380 --> 00:06:56.100
Nicholas VA Farkin hosts prepared the invasion of Norway in a single afternoon

113
00:06:56.290 --> 00:06:58.770
with only the help of a travel guidebook.

114
00:06:58.910 --> 00:07:01.210
The invasion started on the 9th of April,

115
00:07:01.690 --> 00:07:04.090
opposed by both the Norwegian and British Royal Navys.

116
00:07:04.200 --> 00:07:08.770
They opposed the German landing fleets heading for Bergen and trhe succeeding in

117
00:07:08.771 --> 00:07:12.370
sinking 12 German vessels, but EU Fafa air superiority.

118
00:07:12.371 --> 00:07:16.410
It convinced the British Admiralty to cancel further attacks on German landings

119
00:07:17.050 --> 00:07:20.320
Bergen in the means our and the Norwegian army was preparing to fight the

120
00:07:20.321 --> 00:07:23.360
invaders to a demand for surrender. The Norwegians replied,

121
00:07:23.540 --> 00:07:27.560
we will not submit voluntarily. The struggle is already in progress. However,

122
00:07:27.620 --> 00:07:28.453
the Norwegian army,

123
00:07:28.620 --> 00:07:32.200
it was all prepared units moved inland to take advantage of the rugged interior,

124
00:07:32.380 --> 00:07:35.880
but the German progress, it was fast by April the 20th,

125
00:07:36.020 --> 00:07:37.440
11 days into the campaign,

126
00:07:37.460 --> 00:07:41.070
the German army advanced 180 miles from Oslo.

127
00:07:41.330 --> 00:07:45.670
The first British troops led by major general magazine had landed at Hass off

128
00:07:46.190 --> 00:07:50.150
NAIC on April the 15th. They strategic port for the shipment of Anor the force.

129
00:07:50.290 --> 00:07:54.230
It was ill prepared and ill-equipped meaning magazine took its time to finally

130
00:07:54.340 --> 00:07:56.150
move to NAIC in may. Meanwhile,

131
00:07:56.151 --> 00:07:58.030
the Norwegians had to find a loan against Germany,

132
00:07:58.031 --> 00:08:02.420
skilled mountain for troops of general title a second landing expedition at Tron

133
00:08:02.700 --> 00:08:04.300
time supported by Lord of the Admiralty.

134
00:08:04.301 --> 00:08:07.580
Winston Churchill had been canceled and replaced by smaller forces,

135
00:08:07.630 --> 00:08:08.780
north and south of the city,

136
00:08:08.960 --> 00:08:12.740
the British alongside French and Polish forces clashed with the Germans with

137
00:08:12.830 --> 00:08:16.540
heavy casualties on both sides, but the expedition, it was doomed for failure.

138
00:08:16.800 --> 00:08:20.090
The troops involved at little to no air or AR re support.

139
00:08:20.091 --> 00:08:23.210
Plus they had no training of mountains in warfare in a cold climate.

140
00:08:23.590 --> 00:08:27.610
Unlike DS units on the 28th of April, the British commander in Tron time,

141
00:08:27.611 --> 00:08:30.850
general Paget, he ordered an evacuation. And this,

142
00:08:30.910 --> 00:08:34.170
by the way is where our friend Adrian car Wyat made his escape.

143
00:08:34.171 --> 00:08:35.970
You can check out our biographics video on him.

144
00:08:36.230 --> 00:08:39.690
If you haven't seen that one yet, it's a good watcher for might say so myself,

145
00:08:39.970 --> 00:08:41.640
half to Toronto time, the forces in NAIC,

146
00:08:41.641 --> 00:08:44.360
they were left to hold back the Germans. But by the end of may,

147
00:08:44.361 --> 00:08:48.200
the British cabinet decided for a total retreat losing the whole expedition

148
00:08:48.201 --> 00:08:51.680
reforce to the Germans would've spelled disaster in terms of loss of men

149
00:08:51.790 --> 00:08:52.623
equipment,

150
00:08:52.640 --> 00:08:56.520
a morale king Haren of Norway embarked with its government on June the seventh,

151
00:08:56.521 --> 00:08:58.920
heading for Britain by the 9th of June, the campaign,

152
00:08:58.921 --> 00:09:03.760
it was over the Norwegians had suffered 1,335 losses killed or wounded,

153
00:09:03.761 --> 00:09:06.080
which was 2% of their army. The Anglo,

154
00:09:06.280 --> 00:09:09.640
French and Polish allies lost a total of 2,402 soldiers.

155
00:09:09.660 --> 00:09:12.480
And the Germans lost 5,660.

156
00:09:12.690 --> 00:09:16.630
These may appear to be a small campaign compared to others of world Wari,

157
00:09:16.730 --> 00:09:18.510
but the Norwegians and their allies,

158
00:09:18.511 --> 00:09:22.310
they held out for two months against a German invasion longer than any other

159
00:09:22.311 --> 00:09:24.430
country, except for the Soviet union.

160
00:09:24.950 --> 00:09:28.470
The campaign had major political consequences in London with the resignation of

161
00:09:28.471 --> 00:09:31.390
prime minister, Neville Chamberlain, and the appointments of Winston church op.

162
00:09:31.490 --> 00:09:35.700
But getting back to the story today, what were the consequences for creasing

163
00:09:41.770 --> 00:09:45.040
While the fighting raged on the Germans realized that creasing,

164
00:09:45.041 --> 00:09:48.680
despite his reassurances had lost control of the situation NAS,

165
00:09:48.681 --> 00:09:50.800
the country was far from being pacified.

166
00:09:50.940 --> 00:09:54.760
The leader of the national union was eventually sidelines and the Germans

167
00:09:54.761 --> 00:09:56.670
installed a man in Oslo,

168
00:09:56.690 --> 00:10:01.230
Joseph Taren appointed rash commissioner Norway on the 20th of April,

169
00:10:01.230 --> 00:10:03.190
1940 Christ's plan. It was crumbling.

170
00:10:03.250 --> 00:10:07.070
He had a grand idea of him as the leader of an independent Norway,

171
00:10:07.710 --> 00:10:09.470
albeit under German military protection,

172
00:10:09.570 --> 00:10:13.670
the appointment of Travat would've put his country under direct German control.

173
00:10:14.000 --> 00:10:17.540
After the capitulation in June, the parliament, it was dissolved in August.

174
00:10:17.840 --> 00:10:20.100
Norway became a part of the third, right,

175
00:10:20.360 --> 00:10:23.100
but crystalling was not completely outta the picture yet.

176
00:10:23.540 --> 00:10:26.740
Tar saw some use for him, at least as a local figurehead.

177
00:10:26.800 --> 00:10:30.700
The commissar installed whistling as the head of a puppet collaborationist

178
00:10:30.701 --> 00:10:34.860
government. And he proceeded to form a cabinet in the Autum of 1941,

179
00:10:35.040 --> 00:10:38.930
but it was clear that the one pulling this strings would beat Turbon all along.

180
00:10:39.110 --> 00:10:41.810
He proceeded to issue a series of proclamations,

181
00:10:41.870 --> 00:10:46.090
all of which were approved and countersigned by creasing, these reforms,

182
00:10:46.091 --> 00:10:50.450
they included consolidation of one party rule the revocation of freedom of

183
00:10:50.451 --> 00:10:53.970
speech and the introduction of rationing in that same year creasing.

184
00:10:53.971 --> 00:10:56.050
And Turbon welcomed to visit from Heinrich Hela,

185
00:10:56.210 --> 00:10:59.400
who come to oversee the creation of the SS Norland division.

186
00:10:59.470 --> 00:11:03.240
This was composed of Norwegian and other Scandinavian volunteers who pledged

187
00:11:03.241 --> 00:11:07.120
allegiance to the R and fought under German offices shortly afterwards on the

188
00:11:07.121 --> 00:11:08.640
21st, June, 1941,

189
00:11:08.660 --> 00:11:12.200
the invasion of the Soviet union began and on this occasion as well,

190
00:11:12.640 --> 00:11:16.280
increasing had grands plans to shine and to prove his commitment to the struggle

191
00:11:16.281 --> 00:11:21.190
against bism idea was to create a Legion of volunteers to support the German war

192
00:11:21.191 --> 00:11:25.190
effort against the Soviets, the Turbon. He was quicker and beat him to it.

193
00:11:25.450 --> 00:11:29.310
He created a unit of volunteers similar to the SS Norlands,

194
00:11:29.311 --> 00:11:31.710
but larger in scale, a skilled politician,

195
00:11:31.730 --> 00:11:36.230
the Irish commissar placated whistling by reassuring him that the new Legion

196
00:11:36.231 --> 00:11:40.060
would swear allegiance to him rather than any German authority.

197
00:11:40.240 --> 00:11:43.220
The volunteers would also be allowed to wear Norwegian uniforms,

198
00:11:43.221 --> 00:11:46.900
have their own offices, and would only see action on the finish front.

199
00:11:47.700 --> 00:11:49.100
Christing had no choice, but to play along.

200
00:11:49.101 --> 00:11:54.080
And he urged all Norwegians to join the Legiant counted 1,200 recruits

201
00:11:54.081 --> 00:11:58.440
in total many from the herd Quizling's own parliamentary force.

202
00:11:58.650 --> 00:12:02.320
Eventually turban pulled the rug under decreasing. The volunteers were issued.

203
00:12:02.600 --> 00:12:06.760
S uniforms were made to swear on oath to the fur and were sent to the toughest

204
00:12:06.810 --> 00:12:10.200
spots of the main Russian fronts, including the SGE of Lenning grad.

205
00:12:10.330 --> 00:12:11.800
After suffering heavy losses,

206
00:12:11.801 --> 00:12:14.790
the remaining soldiers displayed poor discipline and fighting spirit,

207
00:12:15.090 --> 00:12:18.950
at least according to the SS high commands, but really who could blame them.

208
00:12:19.170 --> 00:12:22.510
The Legion was eventually disbanded and this spells another failure for

209
00:12:22.511 --> 00:12:23.070
whistling.

210
00:12:23.070 --> 00:12:26.790
His idea of contributing to the direct fight against communism had first been

211
00:12:26.791 --> 00:12:29.790
hijacked. And then it had ended in defeat. What's worse.

212
00:12:30.230 --> 00:12:32.830
His already thin base of supporters had been depleted.

213
00:12:33.060 --> 00:12:36.380
I the onslaught of the Eastern front now good news in the online game,

214
00:12:36.580 --> 00:12:40.140
war thunder, you don't have to worry about your soldiers not having discipline.

215
00:12:40.210 --> 00:12:43.180
They're just digital people who carry out your whims.

216
00:12:43.181 --> 00:12:46.380
Like you are some sort of God, which is nice.

217
00:12:46.980 --> 00:12:50.300
War thunder is today's sponsoring the best way for me to show you that game is

218
00:12:50.301 --> 00:12:53.020
to play at sale. Let's jump over to the computer. Everyone.

219
00:12:53.220 --> 00:12:57.490
Welcome to war a thunders. I'm just getting right into it today. We are Germans.

220
00:12:58.250 --> 00:13:01.690
Uh, well actually I'm British, but we are playing Germans. This is a,

221
00:13:01.970 --> 00:13:03.130
I don't even know what tank I'm on.

222
00:13:03.210 --> 00:13:06.250
I had a converter one before and it just got completely destroyed.

223
00:13:06.251 --> 00:13:08.570
You never wanna play convertible. I don't even know what that's for.

224
00:13:08.571 --> 00:13:09.404
It moves really fast,

225
00:13:09.470 --> 00:13:13.210
but this guy's also pretty NiPy this war thunderer I'm playing as TA the tank

226
00:13:13.211 --> 00:13:15.880
game is kind of my favorite, but this guy plays as a plane.

227
00:13:15.980 --> 00:13:19.880
You can also play as a boat. I imagine not in this scenario, there is no seat.

228
00:13:19.890 --> 00:13:22.160
Tanks are a great place to begin. Also begin with arcade.

229
00:13:22.161 --> 00:13:26.160
You can play arcade or realistic or simulator. I always just stick with arcade.

230
00:13:26.161 --> 00:13:27.760
It's kind of fun. You just jump in. If you get,

231
00:13:27.761 --> 00:13:30.720
take the game a bit more seriously though. Definitely play. Uh,

232
00:13:31.130 --> 00:13:34.360
definitely explore those other game. Modes. Loads of tanks,

233
00:13:34.440 --> 00:13:37.950
one day thousand 200 vehicles in this game. Uh, not just tanks. Of course. Uh,

234
00:13:37.951 --> 00:13:41.190
last time I played this map, I got stuck in a hole, which wasn't brilliant.

235
00:13:42.020 --> 00:13:44.870
Stop, stop, stop, stop, stop back it up. Back it up. Don't go over this. Okay,

236
00:13:44.871 --> 00:13:49.550
now we're ready. Target this. Oh,

237
00:13:49.860 --> 00:13:52.390
what I got them. Uh,

238
00:13:52.450 --> 00:13:54.670
but then someone got me back pretty much immediately look at this.

239
00:13:54.700 --> 00:13:59.300
This will fly in. I love this effects. It reminds me of that snip. Oh wow.

240
00:13:59.320 --> 00:14:04.060
He really got me crew knocked out and by knocked out, they mean, you know,

241
00:14:04.420 --> 00:14:07.980
they're, they're in bloody pieces, but fortunately it's just a video game.

242
00:14:07.981 --> 00:14:11.260
So we can res spawn. This is war thunder. It's a great way to sport the show.

243
00:14:11.330 --> 00:14:14.300
It's a lot of fun. It's free to download. So why, why not just go give it a go.

244
00:14:14.301 --> 00:14:18.810
Here's the convertible tank Swar under sign up using the link below to get that

245
00:14:18.840 --> 00:14:23.250
free premium tank or boat or aircraft and the premium

246
00:14:23.560 --> 00:14:25.690
time. And let's get back to it.

247
00:14:31.990 --> 00:14:36.520
The account we've painted so far shows it as if crease was the own only Nazi

248
00:14:36.521 --> 00:14:40.640
sympathizer in Norway. At that time, the reality is actually pretty close.

249
00:14:40.800 --> 00:14:44.760
Novelist and journalists are SCO a former member of the resistance. In fact,

250
00:14:44.960 --> 00:14:45.360
estimates,

251
00:14:45.360 --> 00:14:48.480
there only 2% of the population were supportive of creasing and the Germans,

252
00:14:48.660 --> 00:14:51.400
but the Norwegian prime minister could count on the support of some

253
00:14:51.401 --> 00:14:54.040
heavyweights. Most notably the novelist Kunu Hanson.

254
00:14:54.060 --> 00:14:56.280
One of the giants of Norwegian literature,

255
00:14:56.760 --> 00:15:00.080
Hans took won the Nobel prize for literature in 1920 in the mid thirties,

256
00:15:00.140 --> 00:15:03.920
his support of the Nazi party became incredibly vocal to the point of donating

257
00:15:03.980 --> 00:15:08.320
his Nobel medal to Joseph gulls. At the beginning of the invasion,

258
00:15:08.540 --> 00:15:12.870
one of his articles read Norwegian, throw down your rifles and go home again.

259
00:15:12.930 --> 00:15:16.990
The Germans are fighting for us all and will crush the English tyranny over us

260
00:15:17.250 --> 00:15:20.750
and over all neutrals out of the remaining 98%,

261
00:15:20.950 --> 00:15:24.390
who did not like greasing many were involved in the resistance against the

262
00:15:24.590 --> 00:15:27.870
occupies. Sometimes this manifested in actions of civil descent,

263
00:15:27.871 --> 00:15:30.910
but then escalated into acts of sabotage and assassin.

264
00:15:31.590 --> 00:15:36.060
These were coordinated by the Milog or home front resistance movements with

265
00:15:36.061 --> 00:15:39.540
40,000 members at its peak. In addition to the home front activities,

266
00:15:39.740 --> 00:15:43.340
ordinary citizens did everything in their power, not to yield to the occupation.

267
00:15:43.480 --> 00:15:47.260
It became common on public transport to stand up as to avoid sitting next to a

268
00:15:47.261 --> 00:15:48.700
German or a known collaborator.

269
00:15:48.960 --> 00:15:52.810
The Germans took this issue so seriously that they issued to decree prohibiting

270
00:15:52.990 --> 00:15:56.010
to stand on public transport. If seats were available,

271
00:15:56.450 --> 00:15:59.690
an underground newspaper describes very clearly the purpose of civil dissent

272
00:15:59.691 --> 00:16:04.130
tactics. What the Germans suffer most from here in Norway is the coldness.

273
00:16:04.160 --> 00:16:07.930
They feel from the people and their exclusion from contact.

274
00:16:08.230 --> 00:16:11.770
Let them feel this chill to their very marrow.

275
00:16:12.260 --> 00:16:17.040
The underground press was incredibly active peeking at 300 different newspapers

276
00:16:17.100 --> 00:16:17.900
and magazines.

277
00:16:17.900 --> 00:16:21.880
The government retorted with a 1942 degree that announced the death penalty for

278
00:16:21.881 --> 00:16:25.800
perpetrators of anti-party sentiment. Even in private writings,

279
00:16:25.801 --> 00:16:29.840
such as diaries as the Norwegians, tried to distance themself from the Germans,

280
00:16:29.841 --> 00:16:33.870
the Germans were trying to get very close actually to Norwegian women.

281
00:16:33.970 --> 00:16:38.070
One official SS document stated it is expressly desirable that the German

282
00:16:38.110 --> 00:16:41.630
soldiers conceive as many children as possible with Norwegian women,

283
00:16:41.680 --> 00:16:45.910
regardless of whether it is within or outside the bonds of matrimony.

284
00:16:46.020 --> 00:16:49.950
This was part of the LeMans born program whose aim was to breed as many Ary

285
00:16:50.230 --> 00:16:54.260
children as possible in Norway, 12,000 children were born to these unions.

286
00:16:54.370 --> 00:16:59.060
Some consensual most were forced by the fear of consequences of not complying.

287
00:16:59.470 --> 00:17:02.500
Sadly women involved with German officers did not have the sympathy of their

288
00:17:02.501 --> 00:17:06.420
fellow citizens and could get their heads shaved or be branded with swastikas.

289
00:17:06.570 --> 00:17:08.620
This hostility are continued even after the war.

290
00:17:08.730 --> 00:17:12.620
Many of these 12,000 children were ostracized and often sent away.

291
00:17:13.060 --> 00:17:13.710
Interesting fact,

292
00:17:13.710 --> 00:17:17.610
one of them fled to Sweden to escape this fate and achieved worldwide fame with

293
00:17:17.810 --> 00:17:20.890
our art. You may know her as Frida from the band Aber

294
00:17:26.840 --> 00:17:30.210
Several young men and women from the home front escaped to Britain,

295
00:17:30.220 --> 00:17:33.930
where they were recruited by the special operations executive or SOE.

296
00:17:34.110 --> 00:17:35.400
This army of secret agents,

297
00:17:35.520 --> 00:17:39.520
commando and saboteurs had been instituted by Winston Churchill with the mission

298
00:17:39.740 --> 00:17:42.000
to set Europe ablaze. In other words,

299
00:17:42.140 --> 00:17:45.120
harass German occupation forces throughout continental Europe.

300
00:17:45.220 --> 00:17:49.040
The first operation of the Norwegian SOE commando took place on the 21st of

301
00:17:49.040 --> 00:17:50.120
March, 1941,

302
00:17:50.560 --> 00:17:54.240
their targets VE Laton islands home to the fish oil tanks that were needed for

303
00:17:54.241 --> 00:17:56.880
the production of explosives, the operation. It was a success,

304
00:17:56.881 --> 00:17:58.840
especially from a propaganda point of view,

305
00:17:59.120 --> 00:18:02.560
a news Israel of the time shows the commandos sending a mocking telegram to

306
00:18:02.840 --> 00:18:06.520
Hitler from the islands. I read her Hitler reference. You lost speech.

307
00:18:06.800 --> 00:18:10.230
I thought you said that whenever British troops land on the continent of Europe,

308
00:18:10.250 --> 00:18:13.630
German soldiers will face them. Well, where are they?

309
00:18:13.810 --> 00:18:17.510
The same news reel shows the rounding up of Germans and creasing for

310
00:18:17.511 --> 00:18:20.950
interrogation lings here of course meant local collaborators.

311
00:18:21.130 --> 00:18:23.590
And it's telling how already at this stage of the war,

312
00:18:23.950 --> 00:18:28.910
that Quizling's name had become a synonym for trader on the 1st of February,

313
00:18:28.910 --> 00:18:31.900
1940 Vire was appointed as head of state.

314
00:18:31.920 --> 00:18:33.900
In addition to being head of the governments,

315
00:18:33.901 --> 00:18:38.420
which sounds like a rather empty ceremonial title that was simply bestowed upon

316
00:18:38.421 --> 00:18:39.254
him to keep him happy.

317
00:18:39.440 --> 00:18:42.860
He even had his head on a stamp that the head of state was still the king and

318
00:18:42.861 --> 00:18:45.980
the reigns of government were held by Taron around 1942,

319
00:18:46.000 --> 00:18:47.340
the commando raids in Norway,

320
00:18:47.341 --> 00:18:50.570
they continued mutually supporting and ever active home front.

321
00:18:51.170 --> 00:18:54.090
The most famous action was the destruction of the Telemark plan,

322
00:18:54.210 --> 00:18:56.730
a research facility for the production of heavy water,

323
00:18:56.731 --> 00:19:00.010
which was part of Germany's research effort to develop nuclear weapons.

324
00:19:00.450 --> 00:19:03.970
A little known fact is that a previous raid by an all British team had failed

325
00:19:03.971 --> 00:19:05.570
with six commanders being captured.

326
00:19:06.290 --> 00:19:09.930
Chrisling humiliated by the successes of the SOE in the home front, and, uh,

327
00:19:10.240 --> 00:19:14.280
ju by Turbon authorized their execution. These were formal POWs.

328
00:19:14.281 --> 00:19:18.080
They were uniformed British soldiers. They weren't spies their execution.

329
00:19:18.140 --> 00:19:21.360
It was a war crime, according to the Geneva convention in the same period,

330
00:19:21.960 --> 00:19:22.521
creasing imposed,

331
00:19:22.521 --> 00:19:26.760
or simply authorized measures to enforce harsh martial law on the population.

332
00:19:26.900 --> 00:19:31.550
One of these measures was the forced registration of all Jews in June of 1942

333
00:19:31.810 --> 00:19:35.710
in September, all Jewish property. It was confiscated on October the 25th,

334
00:19:35.990 --> 00:19:39.070
1942 Jewish men over the age of 16 were sent to Auschwitz,

335
00:19:39.071 --> 00:19:43.950
followed by women and children on November the 25th of the 770

336
00:19:43.951 --> 00:19:48.390
people deported 740 of them were killed in the extermination camps.

337
00:19:48.620 --> 00:19:50.590
Only 12 returned after the war,

338
00:19:56.770 --> 00:20:01.580
Chrisling went from cruel BL to cruel blender in 1943 as head of state.

339
00:20:01.581 --> 00:20:03.460
He formerly declared war on the Soviet union.

340
00:20:03.820 --> 00:20:05.380
And I instituted mandatory conscription.

341
00:20:05.381 --> 00:20:07.900
75,000 young Norwegians were called up to arms,

342
00:20:08.010 --> 00:20:10.100
many served in the ski units in Finland's,

343
00:20:10.101 --> 00:20:12.650
but the majority were sent to for the German war effort.

344
00:20:12.710 --> 00:20:16.690
As part of the compulsory labor service compulsory labor was extended to women

345
00:20:16.691 --> 00:20:17.770
in 1944,

346
00:20:17.771 --> 00:20:21.770
when a popular chief of police Gunnar Sison refused to prosecute two girls who

347
00:20:21.771 --> 00:20:25.530
had dodged this unfair draft Queensland demanded that he'd be put to death.

348
00:20:25.740 --> 00:20:30.010
These efforts to ingratiate party leadership were all the more futile as it was

349
00:20:30.011 --> 00:20:34.360
clear that the allies were gonna win war on the 18th of October, 1944,

350
00:20:34.361 --> 00:20:36.200
Soviet troops crossed the border to Norway.

351
00:20:36.270 --> 00:20:39.640
This was the first page in the last chapter of VidCon.

352
00:20:39.641 --> 00:20:43.440
Crystalling sad existence, a failed ambition and treason.

353
00:20:43.620 --> 00:20:45.960
The Soviets were not interested in pushing Southwood.

354
00:20:46.400 --> 00:20:49.560
They instead established bridgehead where Norwegian soldiers under the

355
00:20:49.561 --> 00:20:53.000
government in exile staged to landing in January of 1945,

356
00:20:53.001 --> 00:20:55.800
Christing was invited to Berlin to meet with Hitler. During the meeting,

357
00:20:55.860 --> 00:20:57.240
he proposed desperate plan.

358
00:20:57.460 --> 00:21:01.200
He wanted Norway to regain his independence in order to form an Alliance of

359
00:21:01.201 --> 00:21:02.360
Nordic and genetic people.

360
00:21:02.420 --> 00:21:06.240
He also proposed to the Germans to build a fortres Norway. In other words,

361
00:21:06.440 --> 00:21:10.390
used his own country to stage the last stand of the regime against the allies.

362
00:21:10.480 --> 00:21:14.750
After all, at this point, Norway was home to some 400,000 German troops,

363
00:21:14.860 --> 00:21:16.830
both proposals, unsurprisingly.

364
00:21:16.831 --> 00:21:20.510
They were rebuffed after Hitler suicide on the 30th of April Admiral,

365
00:21:20.750 --> 00:21:23.070
Carl donuts succeeded in his fur. One week later,

366
00:21:23.750 --> 00:21:25.750
DS summon turbot knowing him to be a fanatic.

367
00:21:25.810 --> 00:21:29.580
He dismissed the RS MAA handing over the duties to general boom.

368
00:21:30.000 --> 00:21:33.940
On the 8th of May German forces in Norway capitulated the home front immediately

369
00:21:33.941 --> 00:21:36.180
secured control of the country. On the same day,

370
00:21:36.780 --> 00:21:40.260
Tovan blur himself up with a hand grenade on the ninth Norwegian police arrested

371
00:21:40.860 --> 00:21:43.860
creasing in his Olo mansion called Gimley. According to north mythology,

372
00:21:44.050 --> 00:21:48.290
this was the home of the survivors of Ragner rock. The Twilight of the gods.

373
00:21:48.670 --> 00:21:49.503
The end of times,

374
00:21:50.330 --> 00:21:53.250
chrisling was put on trial with other national union collaborators.

375
00:21:53.350 --> 00:21:55.290
His charges included treason war crimes,

376
00:21:55.291 --> 00:21:57.090
crimes against humanity and embezzlement.

377
00:21:57.230 --> 00:22:01.010
The prosecuting attorney asked him if he had in his speeches expressed the

378
00:22:01.011 --> 00:22:03.090
viewpoints that the Jews are guilty of.

379
00:22:03.130 --> 00:22:06.890
A number of the misfortunes that have stricken the world chrisling did not

380
00:22:06.891 --> 00:22:09.840
flinch. Yes, that is my absolute conviction.

381
00:22:10.020 --> 00:22:14.120
His initial indifference to antisemitism had obviously changed during the warp.

382
00:22:14.180 --> 00:22:17.600
All the evidence was against him. Christie's defense was that all he had done,

383
00:22:17.700 --> 00:22:20.120
he had done to protect Norway from German rule,

384
00:22:20.380 --> 00:22:24.520
but proof of his secret meeting in Denmark one week before the invasion. Well,

385
00:22:24.640 --> 00:22:28.950
it sealed his fate as a trait fi Keasling was executed by firing square on the

386
00:22:28.951 --> 00:22:31.270
24th of October, 1945.

387
00:22:37.490 --> 00:22:41.710
So what is the legacy of VI chrisling? He left no children and his name.

388
00:22:41.740 --> 00:22:43.550
It's now synonymous with collaborator,

389
00:22:43.660 --> 00:22:46.550
with a trait who sells this country to his enemy.

390
00:22:46.930 --> 00:22:48.790
His career may have started with the,

391
00:22:49.460 --> 00:22:51.700
of protecting his country against the Soviet threats,

392
00:22:51.701 --> 00:22:53.700
but when he made contact with the Germans,

393
00:22:53.800 --> 00:22:58.180
all he wanted was recognition and power with his incompetence and his false

394
00:22:58.181 --> 00:23:02.460
promises. He alienated his German allies with his fearful ruthlessness.

395
00:23:02.720 --> 00:23:07.220
He alienated his own country. The irony is that even without his scheming,

396
00:23:07.221 --> 00:23:10.930
Germany, would've probably invaded Norway. And anyway it's resources,

397
00:23:10.931 --> 00:23:12.770
they were just too precious to their war effort.

398
00:23:13.030 --> 00:23:15.250
So what would've bit of him in that case? Well,

399
00:23:15.410 --> 00:23:16.970
let me go back to Steinbeck's novel.

400
00:23:17.110 --> 00:23:19.890
The one I mentioned right at the beginning in its mayor,

401
00:23:20.290 --> 00:23:22.290
Oden is forced by the invaders to cooperate.

402
00:23:22.520 --> 00:23:26.370
They want him not the trader coral to be the front of their decree and orders to

403
00:23:26.371 --> 00:23:30.010
become the legitimate face of their power. But he refuses to cooperate.

404
00:23:30.300 --> 00:23:33.600
If the soldiers want to play dirty, they'd have to do it on their own.

405
00:23:33.870 --> 00:23:37.280
When the resistance intensifies and the officers threaten reprisals,

406
00:23:37.420 --> 00:23:40.840
the mayor refuses to put an end to it, whatever the consequences,

407
00:23:41.370 --> 00:23:43.320
maybe in other circumstances,

408
00:23:43.840 --> 00:23:48.080
VI Bitcoin Quizling could have been in or in our history when he chose to be a

409
00:23:48.280 --> 00:23:51.000
coral. So I really hope you found that video. Interesting. If you did,
