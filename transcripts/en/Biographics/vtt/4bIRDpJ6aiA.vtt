1
00:00:00.060 --> 00:00:04.120
<v 0>It was an event that traumatized in the nation at 11:39 AM on January the 28th,</v>

2
00:00:04.400 --> 00:00:04.900
1986,

3
00:00:04.900 --> 00:00:08.720
the space shuttle challenger lifted off from Cape Canaveral bound for the stars

4
00:00:08.820 --> 00:00:12.000
across the nation. Millions tuned to seas historic flight,

5
00:00:12.020 --> 00:00:14.920
the flight that were put an ordinary civilian, a school teacher,

6
00:00:15.520 --> 00:00:18.680
Chris Macor cliff into space for the first time. Instead,

7
00:00:18.970 --> 00:00:22.670
those viewers witnessed a tragedy. 73 seconds is into its journey.

8
00:00:22.730 --> 00:00:25.230
<v 2>The challenge of disintegrated at 46,000 feet,</v>

9
00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:30.710
the resistant fire above a smoke and then nothing but numb silence today,

10
00:00:30.770 --> 00:00:34.630
the challenge of disaster remains SEAD onto the national consciousness.

11
00:00:34.650 --> 00:00:38.230
But while the story of the tragedy itself has been told and retold,

12
00:00:38.660 --> 00:00:39.710
it's a different story.

13
00:00:39.770 --> 00:00:42.940
We are interested in today or rather seven different stories.

14
00:00:43.120 --> 00:00:47.740
The stories of seven lives each utterly unique and wonderfully ordinary the

15
00:00:47.741 --> 00:00:52.140
lives of seven crew members who died that fateful morning in today's biographics

16
00:00:52.141 --> 00:00:56.060
we're uncovering the real people behind one of America's most iconic tragedies.

17
00:01:08.230 --> 00:01:08.670
<v 0>On paper,</v>

18
00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:12.890
the early lives of Allison on Auca and Ronald McNair couldn't have looked more

19
00:01:13.330 --> 00:01:13.390
different.

20
00:01:13.390 --> 00:01:18.090
The two grew up over 5,000 miles apart on Asuka in the rural paradise of kalac

21
00:01:18.370 --> 00:01:20.730
aura, Hawaiians McNair in the S sweltering,

22
00:01:20.731 --> 00:01:25.240
racially segregated lake city in South Carolina honor's parents were Japanese

23
00:01:25.760 --> 00:01:29.080
Americans who ran a small general store and Kres coffee plantations.

24
00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:32.120
They weren't exactly well off, but neither were they poor McNair.

25
00:01:32.121 --> 00:01:32.641
On the other hand,

26
00:01:32.641 --> 00:01:35.960
grew up knowing the value of labor of having to help his family picking cotton

27
00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:39.080
in the harvest season, beneath the brutal Southern sun yet,

28
00:01:39.081 --> 00:01:42.440
despite their superficial differences, these two boys were still United by one,

29
00:01:42.910 --> 00:01:46.070
sing by invisible threads, linking them across many miles. At nights,

30
00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:49.150
both boys looked up at the sky and they liked to dream.

31
00:01:49.290 --> 00:01:52.910
The older of the two on Zuku was born on June the 24th, 1946.

32
00:01:53.090 --> 00:01:57.270
His birth name was Ozuka showy reflecting his Japanese heritage,

33
00:01:57.530 --> 00:02:01.510
but his childhood couldn't have been a more perfect picture of rural Hawaiian

34
00:02:01.580 --> 00:02:02.391
life. By day,

35
00:02:02.391 --> 00:02:05.660
the boy played among the coffee plantations and explored ancient caves,

36
00:02:05.800 --> 00:02:09.420
but it was at night that Ozuka soul really came alive. Much later.

37
00:02:09.600 --> 00:02:13.380
He had recall evening spent lying on his back, staring up in awe of the stars,

38
00:02:13.381 --> 00:02:15.940
above him at the vast spread of the Milky way.

39
00:02:15.941 --> 00:02:18.340
Shimmering like lights of a far off city.

40
00:02:18.560 --> 00:02:22.020
He said that he used to dream of reaching up there and grabbing hold of those

41
00:02:22.030 --> 00:02:23.500
stars. It may have been, he,

42
00:02:23.590 --> 00:02:28.490
his only respite from a childhood that was busy as hell UCAS parents knew

43
00:02:28.510 --> 00:02:33.090
the key to life was a good education and they made sure the boy worked his off

44
00:02:33.091 --> 00:02:35.490
at school, combined with his job in the family store,

45
00:02:35.730 --> 00:02:39.130
his basketball and some time with the boy Scouts, it made for a brutal schedule,

46
00:02:39.230 --> 00:02:42.970
but it also gave the boy drive drive that would one day taken closer to the

47
00:02:42.971 --> 00:02:44.760
stars than he, of other dreams.

48
00:02:44.980 --> 00:02:49.480
It was a feeling that distant Ron McNair might have recognized born on the

49
00:02:49.481 --> 00:02:50.314
21st of October,

50
00:02:50.560 --> 00:02:54.280
1950 McNair grew up in a town stalked by the ghosts of Jim Crow.

51
00:02:54.490 --> 00:02:57.720
Local Klan meant that sometimes find bullets into black folks, houses,

52
00:02:57.900 --> 00:03:02.760
public spaces were segregated and things like success were only supposed to

53
00:03:02.761 --> 00:03:03.594
be for white kids,

54
00:03:03.740 --> 00:03:07.600
but not even the full force of the South's racism was enough to keep Ron McNair

55
00:03:07.601 --> 00:03:09.040
from his dreams in 1959,

56
00:03:09.041 --> 00:03:11.760
not long after a Shep had became the first American in space.

57
00:03:11.980 --> 00:03:15.800
The young boy decided to read up on the universe to nourish his secret goal of

58
00:03:15.801 --> 00:03:18.790
following in Shep's footsteps. He went down to his local library,

59
00:03:18.990 --> 00:03:22.030
a space that was legally desegregated, but in practice,

60
00:03:22.130 --> 00:03:25.710
it was white only and got an awful of books. As he stood in line.

61
00:03:25.820 --> 00:03:29.990
MCNA recalled hearing all those white adult whispering things like who has this

62
00:03:30.080 --> 00:03:34.030
Negro, when it was his turn, the librarian refused to serve him, get out.

63
00:03:34.030 --> 00:03:37.150
She told him, well, she called the police rather than run McNair.

64
00:03:37.151 --> 00:03:40.140
Hold himself over the counter, told the woman his right to be there.

65
00:03:40.141 --> 00:03:42.460
When the police came, he argued with them too.

66
00:03:42.680 --> 00:03:45.900
The encounter ended with this nine year old boy getting his books stamped and

67
00:03:45.901 --> 00:03:48.140
walking outta the library had held high.

68
00:03:48.320 --> 00:03:52.340
It was the first glimmer of McNair's superhuman determination. Many years later,

69
00:03:52.490 --> 00:03:55.620
when that determination had taken him out of the south first MIT,

70
00:03:55.740 --> 00:03:59.380
and then to NASA, that library would be renamed in his honor,

71
00:03:59.580 --> 00:04:02.610
seven years after his encounter with south Carolina's original.

72
00:04:02.970 --> 00:04:07.610
Karen McNair was at home one day watching a brand new show called star Trek.

73
00:04:09.130 --> 00:04:09.963
<v 1>Live long and prosper.</v>

74
00:04:10.390 --> 00:04:13.130
<v 0>By now, Ellison on Ozuka had left Hawaii to study in Boulder,</v>

75
00:04:13.390 --> 00:04:16.490
but the teenage McNair was still in school, still at home.

76
00:04:16.750 --> 00:04:20.760
As they watched this new show, Ron's brother remarked that the alien were fine,

77
00:04:21.040 --> 00:04:25.280
but this idea that white people would one day live and work with black folks was

78
00:04:25.310 --> 00:04:29.280
unrealistic. Ron just kept quiet. I looked at it as science fiction.

79
00:04:29.500 --> 00:04:33.560
His brother later said, cuz that wasn't gonna happen. But Ronald saw it.

80
00:04:33.640 --> 00:04:34.680
A science possibility

81
00:04:40.780 --> 00:04:44.910
Much later, both Ellison on Zuki and Ron MCNA would embrace the milestones.

82
00:04:44.911 --> 00:04:48.710
They achieved the first Japanese American and second African American in space.

83
00:04:49.010 --> 00:04:52.510
But Judith Renik always kicked back blessed with the brain,

84
00:04:52.511 --> 00:04:53.344
the size of a planet.

85
00:04:53.370 --> 00:04:56.830
It annoyed her no ends that the press preferred to focus on her status as the

86
00:04:56.831 --> 00:04:59.750
second American woman and first American Jew in orbit,

87
00:04:59.751 --> 00:05:03.460
especially when report asked our staff like, do you wear makeup in space,

88
00:05:03.640 --> 00:05:06.700
cringe, inducing, casual misogynists aside.

89
00:05:07.100 --> 00:05:11.820
Everyone knew that Resnick wasn't just at NASA for her XX chromosomes born in

90
00:05:11.910 --> 00:05:13.660
Akron, Ohio on April the fifth,

91
00:05:13.940 --> 00:05:18.860
1949 Resnick's background was solidly middle class and solidly Jewish as a kid.

92
00:05:18.861 --> 00:05:19.694
She learned Hebrew,

93
00:05:19.720 --> 00:05:22.410
but it wouldn't be in religion that she fell out inspiration,

94
00:05:22.790 --> 00:05:26.690
but rather maths from the earliest days REIC was available. Prodigy.

95
00:05:26.800 --> 00:05:30.850
When it came time to suit hers, a T she scored a perfect 800 on both tests.

96
00:05:30.850 --> 00:05:35.130
Something barely a quarter of, 1% of test takers achieved on top of that.

97
00:05:35.150 --> 00:05:38.730
She trained herself up in her spare time to become a skilled classical pianist.

98
00:05:38.870 --> 00:05:42.920
But while re Nick's life may have looked like a series of wins things weren't

99
00:05:42.921 --> 00:05:44.680
always perfect. At the age of 17,

100
00:05:44.880 --> 00:05:47.240
her parents marriage ended in a messy divorce by now.

101
00:05:47.241 --> 00:05:50.760
Judith had grown into a single-minded teenager with a shock of curly hair that

102
00:05:50.940 --> 00:05:54.520
she rolled with small orange juice scans to try and straighten it out.

103
00:05:54.550 --> 00:05:56.720
When her parents split. She, but cut her mother off,

104
00:05:56.840 --> 00:05:59.520
choosing to live solely with her dad. When she first went into space,

105
00:05:59.521 --> 00:06:02.000
she pointedly held up a sign saying, hi dad,

106
00:06:02.260 --> 00:06:05.720
her strict mom would never get a similar greeting, but that was Judith.

107
00:06:06.040 --> 00:06:08.120
Renik all over. When she set her mind to something,

108
00:06:08.140 --> 00:06:11.200
be it personal or professional, that was simply no changing it.

109
00:06:11.300 --> 00:06:13.960
She wanted to study electrical engineering. She did it.

110
00:06:14.100 --> 00:06:18.750
She wanted to get her PhD. She did it. She wanted to apply for NASA. Well,

111
00:06:19.130 --> 00:06:21.230
you get the idea for Dick SCOBY.

112
00:06:21.260 --> 00:06:25.590
This insane motivation may well have brought a rise, smile to his face,

113
00:06:25.870 --> 00:06:28.070
hear all people knew what it was like to really commit to something.

114
00:06:28.090 --> 00:06:29.670
The commander of the challenger. Well,

115
00:06:29.950 --> 00:06:32.790
faith all day Francis Richard SCOBY was born on may the 19th,

116
00:06:33.110 --> 00:06:37.740
1939 in the shadow of Mount rain rather than a prodigy like Greig though,

117
00:06:37.741 --> 00:06:40.780
his childhood was defined by his seeming lack of greatness.

118
00:06:40.880 --> 00:06:43.300
He was big and a little slow, not a bad student,

119
00:06:43.400 --> 00:06:46.860
but not a particularly good one, nor was he all that social as a teenager,

120
00:06:47.260 --> 00:06:51.100
a good night out for SCOBY was going to the rainbow cafe with a couple of

121
00:06:51.101 --> 00:06:53.700
friends and finishing a whole bottle of ketchup with his fries.

122
00:06:54.060 --> 00:06:55.140
Most people did a small town,

123
00:06:55.141 --> 00:06:58.050
assumed it grabbed work on the railroads like his dad.

124
00:06:58.270 --> 00:07:00.570
So when he enlisted in the air force right out of high school,

125
00:07:00.571 --> 00:07:03.450
it was something of a shock still SCOI wasn't training to be a pilot or

126
00:07:03.570 --> 00:07:05.010
anything. He was a propeller mechanic,

127
00:07:05.150 --> 00:07:08.010
not all that different from the blue collar works that he might have done on the

128
00:07:08.130 --> 00:07:12.410
railroads. Little did his friends realize that this was just the beginning buy,

129
00:07:12.411 --> 00:07:16.450
never excelling. SCOI did have one quality that stood out in his early life.

130
00:07:16.710 --> 00:07:21.200
He never the gave up. It could be the football training. He'd never missed. One.

131
00:07:21.480 --> 00:07:24.560
Saw the studies. He worked hard at harder than the brain he could,

132
00:07:24.800 --> 00:07:26.400
who could just coast through life.

133
00:07:26.670 --> 00:07:29.640
This was his secret weapon knowing he wasn't naturally gifted,

134
00:07:29.660 --> 00:07:33.440
but SCOBY also knew that he had to work 20 times as hard to get anywhere.

135
00:07:33.760 --> 00:07:37.240
And so that's exactly what he did repairing planes in the air force. By day,

136
00:07:37.300 --> 00:07:40.950
he studied all night at, into the airmen's education and commissioning program.

137
00:07:41.450 --> 00:07:45.150
It took until 1966, but he finally made it finally became an officer.

138
00:07:45.540 --> 00:07:48.750
Finally got his wings, but it wouldn't be straight to NASA.

139
00:07:49.040 --> 00:07:53.110
First Dick SCOBY was going to earn his stripes in the Inferno of war.

140
00:07:59.440 --> 00:08:01.900
On the morning of January the 16th, 1978,

141
00:08:01.901 --> 00:08:05.740
George AEY sat down in his eighth floor office at the NASA Johnson space center

142
00:08:05.800 --> 00:08:09.580
to make an important call or rather a series of important calls across the

143
00:08:09.581 --> 00:08:09.810
country.

144
00:08:09.810 --> 00:08:13.940
Anxious people were waiting by their phones desperate to know if they'd made it.

145
00:08:14.000 --> 00:08:17.780
If they'd be one of the 35 selected for NASA's first astronaut training program

146
00:08:18.060 --> 00:08:20.290
in over a decade. Prior to that win morning,

147
00:08:20.350 --> 00:08:24.650
the last set of recruits had been the X S 11 class to way back in

148
00:08:24.850 --> 00:08:28.890
1967, also known as astronaut group six. There'd been smart commendable people,

149
00:08:28.950 --> 00:08:33.690
but there'd also been uniformly male and uniformly white a description that

150
00:08:33.691 --> 00:08:38.410
could also fit astronaut group seven brought over in 1969 from an abandoned air

151
00:08:38.411 --> 00:08:42.000
force space program with the 19 is approaching NASA wanted a group that would

152
00:08:42.001 --> 00:08:46.160
better reflect America, a group in which being white and having a dog.

153
00:08:46.340 --> 00:08:47.880
Wasn't a deal breakup.

154
00:08:47.900 --> 00:08:51.960
The calls George a made that day would be the first tentative step along that

155
00:08:51.961 --> 00:08:56.240
path along the first notified was Ellison on Azu cup since leaving Hawaii in the

156
00:08:56.400 --> 00:08:59.480
1960s on AKA's career had taken off like, well,

157
00:08:59.560 --> 00:09:02.400
a rocket armed with a degree in aerospace engineering.

158
00:09:02.401 --> 00:09:06.040
The boy from Kona had enrolled in the air force becoming a test pilot,

159
00:09:06.300 --> 00:09:10.440
but while plenty of Flyboy had egos bigger than their aircraft on Asuka charmed

160
00:09:10.640 --> 00:09:12.600
everyone with his modesty. He threw backyard.

161
00:09:12.880 --> 00:09:15.510
Lou OS for his workmates complete with all roasted hogs,

162
00:09:15.910 --> 00:09:17.910
served the ground crew steaming mugs of Ko of coffee.

163
00:09:18.310 --> 00:09:21.310
Yet he wasn't the only beloved air force pilot in NASA's new class.

164
00:09:21.360 --> 00:09:23.670
After getting his wings, Dick SCOBY had survived.

165
00:09:23.690 --> 00:09:27.430
The green hail of the Vietnam war. A cargo pilot had come under enemy fire,

166
00:09:27.431 --> 00:09:29.790
taking hits in several runs and experience.

167
00:09:30.030 --> 00:09:33.910
He never liked to talk about yet traumatic as Vietnam was it didn't put SCOI off

168
00:09:33.911 --> 00:09:35.420
flying back in the us.

169
00:09:35.440 --> 00:09:39.620
The railroad workers son had followed a similar career to Ozuka test piloting

170
00:09:39.621 --> 00:09:40.660
experimental aircraft.

171
00:09:40.770 --> 00:09:45.500
This had included the X 24 B a prototype one step below the space shuttle

172
00:09:45.600 --> 00:09:48.100
itself. So when naer opened its doors for applications,

173
00:09:48.101 --> 00:09:49.820
it was only natural SCOBY would apply,

174
00:09:50.080 --> 00:09:53.700
but don't go thinking SCOI was just some adrenaline junkie outside flying

175
00:09:53.701 --> 00:09:57.490
Scooby's greatest joys were painting and taking evening walks with his wife,

176
00:09:57.491 --> 00:09:59.370
holding hands. As the stars came out,

177
00:09:59.510 --> 00:10:03.010
it was a relaxed time life that probably wouldn't have suited Ron McNair,

178
00:10:03.190 --> 00:10:07.330
unlike on zoo and SCOBY McNair's path, hadn't taken him to the air force,

179
00:10:07.350 --> 00:10:11.810
but instead to being a badass scientist, after graduating in 1967,

180
00:10:11.811 --> 00:10:15.930
the boy from South Carolina had sworn to have his PhD. In 10 years,

181
00:10:16.360 --> 00:10:20.560
he left the south headed to MIT where I graduated age 26 with both a doctorate

182
00:10:20.580 --> 00:10:23.160
in laser physics and some eccentric hobbies.

183
00:10:23.660 --> 00:10:25.880
McNair was seriously into karate.

184
00:10:26.460 --> 00:10:30.080
How serious while so serious that it written an article for scientific American

185
00:10:30.100 --> 00:10:31.360
on the physics of martial arts,

186
00:10:31.361 --> 00:10:34.840
which is basically 18 boy fantasy of what science is like.

187
00:10:34.841 --> 00:10:37.870
He was also an accomplished saxophone in player in 1984.

188
00:10:38.070 --> 00:10:41.150
It make history by being the first person to play an instrument in space,

189
00:10:41.370 --> 00:10:45.910
but there was at least one other musician among NASA's new hires just by being

190
00:10:45.911 --> 00:10:50.350
known as the 35 new guys. The 1978 intake included six women.

191
00:10:50.730 --> 00:10:54.190
One famously would be Sally ride. The first American women in space.

192
00:10:54.220 --> 00:10:58.580
Another would be Judith Resnik of everyone in this video who isn't named Chris

193
00:10:58.980 --> 00:11:02.380
Macor cliff Renik may have had the strangest journey to NASA in 1970.

194
00:11:02.600 --> 00:11:06.180
She married her college sweetheart and gone to work for the radio corporation of

195
00:11:06.181 --> 00:11:07.540
America there. She settled in.

196
00:11:07.700 --> 00:11:10.340
So what should have been a comfortable middle class existence?

197
00:11:10.450 --> 00:11:14.180
Comfortable had never been enough for REIC no long after divorcing.

198
00:11:14.420 --> 00:11:17.500
She sat on the Delaware shore with some friends. When they,

199
00:11:17.830 --> 00:11:19.450
the form that she was filling in,

200
00:11:19.550 --> 00:11:22.610
it was an application to join NASA with the single mindedness.

201
00:11:22.611 --> 00:11:25.250
She brought to everything. REIC had chased this opportunity,

202
00:11:25.251 --> 00:11:28.970
putting herself through an insane exercise regime to pass the physical.

203
00:11:29.070 --> 00:11:32.970
It had been hard work, but it paid off just before 6:00 AM on January the 16th.

204
00:11:33.410 --> 00:11:34.610
REIC received a call from George,

205
00:11:34.770 --> 00:11:37.890
a out of 10,000 applications she'd made the cut.

206
00:11:38.140 --> 00:11:40.120
Two weeks later REIC would find herself in Houston,

207
00:11:40.121 --> 00:11:43.240
meeting on Zuka McNair and SCOBY for the first time Liz,

208
00:11:43.340 --> 00:11:46.240
did she know how tragically her name would soon be tied to theirs

209
00:11:52.420 --> 00:11:57.360
In NASA history? The 35 new guys hold a special place alongside Sally ride.

210
00:11:57.361 --> 00:11:59.080
The class gave the world ion Blueford,

211
00:11:59.081 --> 00:12:01.720
the first African American in space and Annalee Fisher,

212
00:12:01.860 --> 00:12:04.400
the first mother in orbits, but there are three names,

213
00:12:04.430 --> 00:12:07.320
conspicuously absent from its Illumina. Mike J. Smith,

214
00:12:07.321 --> 00:12:09.600
Gregory Jarvis and Chris coli.

215
00:12:09.620 --> 00:12:12.440
That's because the challenges on the crew members never applied for the

216
00:12:12.510 --> 00:12:13.350
astronaut program.

217
00:12:13.700 --> 00:12:17.510
Instead they enter NASA's orbit in different ways often by fluke,

218
00:12:17.610 --> 00:12:19.190
as we leave Judith Resnick and listen.

219
00:12:19.550 --> 00:12:22.190
And Zuka Ron McNair and Dick SCOBY to their training program.

220
00:12:22.380 --> 00:12:25.750
It's time we met the final challenger, three of all the trio,

221
00:12:25.770 --> 00:12:28.470
the most obvious candidate for future astronaut was easily.

222
00:12:28.740 --> 00:12:31.510
Mike Smith born on the 30th of April, 1945.

223
00:12:31.511 --> 00:12:35.580
Smith childhood was defined eyes fascination with flying his parents' 13 acre

224
00:12:35.581 --> 00:12:38.660
chicken farm was right across from Beaufort Morehead, city, airport.

225
00:12:38.661 --> 00:12:41.900
And the boy grew up witnessing planes rising into the clear skies,

226
00:12:42.160 --> 00:12:45.340
but his connection with flight went deeper than just one airport.

227
00:12:45.450 --> 00:12:47.740
This part of North Carolina, near the outer banks,

228
00:12:47.760 --> 00:12:50.300
fairly drips with aviation history.

229
00:12:50.301 --> 00:12:53.300
It was around here that the Wright brothers made the first flight in 1903.

230
00:12:53.600 --> 00:12:57.570
Mike Smith dreamed of being part of that history during a junior high football

231
00:12:57.571 --> 00:12:58.970
match, the airplane crazy Smith,

232
00:12:58.971 --> 00:13:02.770
spotted a craft overhead and halted the game just so he could stand there and

233
00:13:02.771 --> 00:13:04.010
look on his 16th birthday.

234
00:13:04.070 --> 00:13:07.610
He completed his first solo flight earning his pilot's license before he could

235
00:13:07.611 --> 00:13:11.130
even drive a car. But while Smith would always be obsessed with aircraft,

236
00:13:11.350 --> 00:13:14.320
his dreams were about to be boosted to a whole other level,

237
00:13:14.390 --> 00:13:18.720
just like Ron McNair down in lake city Smith followed Alan Shepard's 1961 space

238
00:13:18.721 --> 00:13:19.281
flight with war.

239
00:13:19.281 --> 00:13:22.800
According to his brother Smith decided right then and there that did one day go

240
00:13:22.801 --> 00:13:26.280
into space. Only his career. Didn't quite take him in that direction.

241
00:13:26.281 --> 00:13:29.320
Enrolling in the us Naval academy in June of 1963,

242
00:13:29.321 --> 00:13:32.960
Smith followed his original passion for airplanes who went to the Navy's flight

243
00:13:32.961 --> 00:13:35.910
school causing only to marry Jane and Gerald. And from there,

244
00:13:35.911 --> 00:13:38.830
it was into war like Dick SCOBY, Mike Smith flew in Vietnam.

245
00:13:39.210 --> 00:13:43.230
Unlike his future commander though Smith flew attack planes big as six intruders

246
00:13:43.231 --> 00:13:44.590
that took off from the aircraft carrier.

247
00:13:45.310 --> 00:13:48.870
Kittyhawk named after the same North Carolina town that Smith had flown over as

248
00:13:48.871 --> 00:13:51.830
a teenager where the Wright brothers took their history changing flight.

249
00:13:51.980 --> 00:13:56.540
When 1978 rolled around and our first four sub JS were applying for NASA's

250
00:13:56.541 --> 00:14:00.260
astronaut school Smith was chilling in the Mediterranean where he'd been

251
00:14:00.261 --> 00:14:01.260
assigned to a ship,

252
00:14:01.400 --> 00:14:04.580
but there must have been a tiny part of him yearning for something more,

253
00:14:04.900 --> 00:14:09.220
a part that remembered how age 16 had listened to news of a Shepard's flight and

254
00:14:09.221 --> 00:14:10.420
dreamed of going into space.

255
00:14:10.600 --> 00:14:14.460
We can infer this because in 1980 NASA approached him with an offer to become an

256
00:14:14.461 --> 00:14:16.970
astronaut. Just weeks before the Navy had offered Smith,

257
00:14:17.010 --> 00:14:19.170
a job of commanding an entire ASIC squadron,

258
00:14:19.370 --> 00:14:23.490
the Smith turned them down for a lower rank and lower pay at NASA speaks volumes

259
00:14:23.491 --> 00:14:26.690
about his priorities. It wasn't easy either effectively demoted.

260
00:14:26.691 --> 00:14:28.690
He had to struggle for two years as a novice. Again,

261
00:14:28.691 --> 00:14:32.570
only finally working his way back up to the rank of commander in 1982,

262
00:14:32.790 --> 00:14:35.930
by now the space shuttle was undertaking regular missions into orbit,

263
00:14:36.300 --> 00:14:38.040
but getting on a flight wasn't guaranteed,

264
00:14:38.220 --> 00:14:42.600
not when so many were waiting that turn. So Smith waited and waited.

265
00:14:42.780 --> 00:14:46.400
He waited as the years passed as the 1978 class went into space,

266
00:14:46.401 --> 00:14:49.360
breaking records and making historical firsts.

267
00:14:49.540 --> 00:14:54.400
He waited until finally one day, his time came in late 1985.

268
00:14:54.401 --> 00:14:57.200
NASA told Mike Smith that scheduled him for his first space flight.

269
00:14:57.230 --> 00:15:00.800
It'd be second in command board. The challenger in January of 1986,

270
00:15:01.100 --> 00:15:05.680
his commander would be Dick SCOBY and with would be E on Asuka Judith

271
00:15:06.120 --> 00:15:08.400
Renik and Ron McNair. Plus two civilians.

272
00:15:08.540 --> 00:15:11.830
One of them was an engineer whose company NASA through it offered seats as a

273
00:15:11.831 --> 00:15:15.670
sort of thanks for work done. The other would be the first teacher in space

274
00:15:21.770 --> 00:15:24.270
On the cold morning of January, the 28th, 1986,

275
00:15:25.230 --> 00:15:28.070
Gregory Jarvis sat back in his shuttle seat facing the sky beside him.

276
00:15:28.310 --> 00:15:30.950
Chris McCali waited patiently as she had for hours. Now,

277
00:15:31.210 --> 00:15:35.420
days of multiple false starts when the flight was repeatedly aborted,

278
00:15:35.640 --> 00:15:39.020
the only two civilians on the challenger both had been given the title of

279
00:15:39.021 --> 00:15:42.940
payload specialists, effectively NASA jargon for people with no specific role.

280
00:15:43.000 --> 00:15:46.500
As the crew waited for the all clear Jarvis passed the time by telling jokes.

281
00:15:46.520 --> 00:15:49.860
He told people privately, he mostly did it for call OFS benefits.

282
00:15:49.861 --> 00:15:50.740
As she seemed nervous,

283
00:15:51.000 --> 00:15:55.330
he didn't acknowledge that the weak gags were to settle his own nerves too.

284
00:15:55.360 --> 00:15:57.250
Born on August the 24th, 1944,

285
00:15:58.050 --> 00:16:00.410
Gregory Jarvis can best be described as endearingly geeky,

286
00:16:00.570 --> 00:16:04.290
official NASA photos show a dorky kind of guy grinning like it just won the

287
00:16:04.291 --> 00:16:07.530
space lottery, given his life's path. That makes a whole lot of sense.

288
00:16:07.560 --> 00:16:09.290
Growing up in the small town of Mohawk,

289
00:16:09.310 --> 00:16:12.520
New York Jarvis's childhood was spent as far from the action and as possible,

290
00:16:12.840 --> 00:16:15.920
but coming from a small town didn't mean having small ambitions after his

291
00:16:15.921 --> 00:16:20.080
parents divorced Jarvis left for good marrying Marcia Jarbo and entering the air

292
00:16:20.081 --> 00:16:22.960
force reserve officer training court arms with the degree in electrical

293
00:16:23.160 --> 00:16:23.960
engineering,

294
00:16:23.960 --> 00:16:27.000
Jarvis and Marcia were dispatched to LA to help build tactical communications

295
00:16:27.280 --> 00:16:29.800
satellites. They expected to be there a short while.

296
00:16:29.950 --> 00:16:33.670
Instead they wound up living in California for 16 years in many way,

297
00:16:33.671 --> 00:16:35.230
those 16 years sound idyllic.

298
00:16:35.231 --> 00:16:38.710
The pair lived in a mustard colored house in a seven minute walk from the ocean,

299
00:16:39.230 --> 00:16:42.830
although they never had kids, they both held an almost childlike love of sports.

300
00:16:42.990 --> 00:16:46.550
Weekends were spent doing long runs going whitewater rafting, surfing,

301
00:16:46.690 --> 00:16:48.230
or taking long biking trips.

302
00:16:48.231 --> 00:16:50.870
Even when Jarvis left the air force in the early 1970s,

303
00:16:50.871 --> 00:16:53.460
moving into the communications arm of Hughes air aircraft,

304
00:16:53.720 --> 00:16:56.820
the couple continued living in LA, but it was at Hughes. The,

305
00:16:56.821 --> 00:17:01.140
the wheels were set in motion for Jarvis's ultimate fate as manager of a project

306
00:17:01.240 --> 00:17:04.340
to build NASA satellites. Jarvis quickly came to his boss's attention.

307
00:17:04.560 --> 00:17:08.100
So when NASA repaid the company by offering two of its engineers seats on the

308
00:17:08.101 --> 00:17:08.440
shuttle,

309
00:17:08.440 --> 00:17:12.460
the higher ups decided to reward Jarvis with the adventure of a lifetime.

310
00:17:12.630 --> 00:17:16.850
Originally was meant to fly in 1985, but then two politicians,

311
00:17:16.851 --> 00:17:20.450
Senator Jake gon and Republican bill Nelson had muscled in on the flights that

312
00:17:20.610 --> 00:17:21.970
had been scheduled for as a result.

313
00:17:21.971 --> 00:17:24.170
Jarvis had been bumped to the challenger still.

314
00:17:24.370 --> 00:17:27.410
It had given him a chance to get to know the most famous crew member of all

315
00:17:28.050 --> 00:17:31.170
Chris CIFF. Even if you've never heard of any of the others in this video,

316
00:17:31.171 --> 00:17:35.480
there's a good chance you knowif born Sharon Krista Corrigan on September the

317
00:17:35.640 --> 00:17:36.480
second, 1948,

318
00:17:36.640 --> 00:17:40.400
but CIFF had known from an early age that she wanted to be a teacher raised in

319
00:17:40.401 --> 00:17:42.480
the small town of framing him outside Boston.

320
00:17:42.700 --> 00:17:45.080
She was the only girl in a family brewed with four boys.

321
00:17:45.220 --> 00:17:47.280
Her parents had been so certain that she'd be male.

322
00:17:47.520 --> 00:17:50.480
That the name Krista was a last minute shortening of her chosen boy name,

323
00:17:50.510 --> 00:17:53.720
Christopher like her parents call if was extremely traditional.

324
00:17:53.860 --> 00:17:55.760
She chose to go to a strict Catholic school.

325
00:17:55.820 --> 00:17:57.640
And when it came time for her to go to college,

326
00:17:57.710 --> 00:18:00.120
offered to go to the local cheaper university.

327
00:18:00.140 --> 00:18:03.000
So her parents would've more money to spend on her brothers on campus.

328
00:18:03.060 --> 00:18:05.640
She avoided the social movements of the late 1960s.

329
00:18:05.641 --> 00:18:08.750
Instead focusing on a history course and relationship with high school called

330
00:18:08.751 --> 00:18:11.110
sweetheart Steven McCollough, but like the others in this video,

331
00:18:11.410 --> 00:18:12.990
she harbored a secret dream call.

332
00:18:13.110 --> 00:18:17.190
If two remembered a sheds 1961 voyage like Mike Smith and Ron McNair,

333
00:18:17.191 --> 00:18:18.910
she dreamed the following in his footsteps.

334
00:18:19.210 --> 00:18:23.350
Not that this seemed even remotely possible in the fall of 1917 McCollough began

335
00:18:23.510 --> 00:18:25.950
teaching eventually settling in Concord, New Hampshire.

336
00:18:26.010 --> 00:18:29.740
Her goal was to bring her twin subjects of history and social studies alive,

337
00:18:29.741 --> 00:18:33.980
something she did by using diaries of female pioneers and inviting people with

338
00:18:34.180 --> 00:18:35.740
interesting lives to speak before the class.

339
00:18:35.880 --> 00:18:39.660
By the time Ronald Reagan announced the teacher in space program in 1984 MC CIFF

340
00:18:39.661 --> 00:18:41.380
was a successful teacher. A mother of two,

341
00:18:41.381 --> 00:18:44.820
someone has settled into ordinary life as it's possible to be.

342
00:18:45.180 --> 00:18:47.260
It turns out that's exactly what NASA we're looking for.

343
00:18:47.520 --> 00:18:51.050
The agency's brief with the teacher in space program was to pick someone who

344
00:18:51.051 --> 00:18:52.410
could represent normal Americans,

345
00:18:52.710 --> 00:18:56.050
the sort of dedicated public servants that crystal embodied it.

346
00:18:56.410 --> 00:18:57.610
Doubtless helps that in her application,

347
00:18:57.630 --> 00:19:01.090
she emphasized the positive effect of seeing another woman in space would have

348
00:19:01.150 --> 00:19:04.930
on the girls that she taught. She even pledged to keep her own pioneer diary,

349
00:19:04.931 --> 00:19:06.650
recording her life on the final frontier.

350
00:19:06.990 --> 00:19:10.800
And so it was that Chris CIFF came to sit next to Gregory jar is on that day.

351
00:19:11.180 --> 00:19:15.720
Now a national celebrity smiling at his corny jokes as they waited for launch at

352
00:19:15.721 --> 00:19:19.400
exactly 11:39 AM. The engines began to roar the rocket beneath them,

353
00:19:19.401 --> 00:19:22.680
began to shake an almighty rumbling that seemed to fill every fiber of their

354
00:19:22.681 --> 00:19:23.720
being with a great roar.

355
00:19:23.740 --> 00:19:27.480
The rocket carrying the seven challenger astronauts took off the stars. Sadly,

356
00:19:27.830 --> 00:19:29.560
none of them would reach their destination.

357
00:19:36.470 --> 00:19:39.590
73 seconds after launch the challenger broke apart at 46,000 feet.

358
00:19:39.690 --> 00:19:43.110
The cause would later be determined to be two small rubber O-rings that failed

359
00:19:43.111 --> 00:19:45.710
in the cold temperatures. Something NASA had been warned about.

360
00:19:46.190 --> 00:19:48.510
It was an entirely preventable disaster.

361
00:19:48.950 --> 00:19:52.020
Although the craft went up in flames it's they thought that the crew survived

362
00:19:52.021 --> 00:19:55.420
the initial far only dying. When the cap crashed into the ocean,

363
00:19:55.560 --> 00:19:56.393
two minutes later,

364
00:19:56.560 --> 00:20:00.260
the last words captured by the inflight recorder belong to Mike Smith just

365
00:20:00.261 --> 00:20:04.540
before the shuttle disintegrated. He could be heard saying, oh, after that,

366
00:20:04.710 --> 00:20:06.260
there was nothing. At this point,

367
00:20:06.261 --> 00:20:08.300
the details of the tragedy itself are well known.

368
00:20:08.440 --> 00:20:10.420
How the cruise families were on the grounds.

369
00:20:10.580 --> 00:20:12.930
Watching as the challenge are ignited before their eyes,

370
00:20:13.230 --> 00:20:17.170
how TV cameras broadcast the disaster live including to millions of children,

371
00:20:17.530 --> 00:20:21.050
watching bars, special links in their schools, the other equally sad,

372
00:20:21.051 --> 00:20:22.010
but smaller details.

373
00:20:22.080 --> 00:20:25.970
Like how Cliff's nine year olds received a letter she'd written a week after the

374
00:20:26.130 --> 00:20:27.930
accident or how her father had said,

375
00:20:28.030 --> 00:20:32.010
he felt sure Gregory Jarvis had held her hand as they felt towards the air

376
00:20:32.320 --> 00:20:35.760
ocean, a last act of kindness before their lives were cut short.

377
00:20:36.100 --> 00:20:39.800
We could go on the switch activated on Mike Smith's breathing pack from behind

378
00:20:39.801 --> 00:20:43.800
suggesting Judith reson accused her last moments on earth to try and help her

379
00:20:43.801 --> 00:20:47.640
cremate. The sad return of Ellison on Mizu is remains to his beloved Hawaii.

380
00:20:47.780 --> 00:20:48.613
The scholarship program,

381
00:20:49.080 --> 00:20:51.720
since set up in Ron McNair's name for disadvantaged kids,

382
00:20:52.020 --> 00:20:53.640
we could go on at this point,

383
00:20:53.641 --> 00:20:57.160
there's maybe no need thousands of documentaries already exist on the disaster

384
00:20:57.400 --> 00:20:59.160
in its aftermath. With this episode, though,

385
00:20:59.220 --> 00:21:02.440
we wanted to do something different to focus on the lesser told story,

386
00:21:02.800 --> 00:21:05.160
that story of the crew themselves, although in the end,

387
00:21:05.390 --> 00:21:07.070
what made them famous of deaths?

388
00:21:07.090 --> 00:21:10.390
All seven astronauts on the challenger had lived remarkable lives.

389
00:21:10.620 --> 00:21:13.390
Some had risen up from disadvantaged backgrounds to make something of

390
00:21:13.391 --> 00:21:16.870
themselves. Others had followed a dream with a laser focused ambition.

391
00:21:16.970 --> 00:21:21.110
Others had just been wonderfully ordinary, ordinary husbands, wives, fathers,

392
00:21:21.111 --> 00:21:23.590
mothers who left behind void in their family's lives.

393
00:21:23.780 --> 00:21:25.230
When covering tragedies like this,

394
00:21:25.231 --> 00:21:30.060
it's often easier to focus on the disaster itself to put things in a

395
00:21:30.061 --> 00:21:33.620
political context or zero in on the shocking details,

396
00:21:33.800 --> 00:21:36.740
but it's worth remembering to the real lives of those involved.

397
00:21:36.840 --> 00:21:38.460
The people behind the names,

398
00:21:38.800 --> 00:21:43.220
the seven challenger crew members with their own stories and dreams each so

399
00:21:43.221 --> 00:21:46.500
worthy of being remembered on Auca McNair.

400
00:21:46.920 --> 00:21:51.210
Resick SCOBY Smith, Jarvis mace.

401
00:21:51.810 --> 00:21:55.290
They may be long dead now, but their memories should not be forgotten.
