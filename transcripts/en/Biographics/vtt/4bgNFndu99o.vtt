Jack House Squarespace through that link in the description below more on them

6
00:00:14.851 --> 00:00:15.684
in a bit,

7
00:00:21.440 --> 00:00:25.790
The cold war between the United States and the Soviet union was one of the most

8
00:00:25.791 --> 00:00:30.350
complex and long-lasting chapters of tension between two countries in all of

9
00:00:30.351 --> 00:00:31.011
human history.

10
00:00:31.011 --> 00:00:35.870
From the time world war two ended until the Soviet union dissolved in 1991,

11
00:00:36.050 --> 00:00:40.760
both nations held worldwide nuclear devastation in their hands while the two

12
00:00:40.761 --> 00:00:45.200
vaguely fought for the same side to defeat Germany and the other access powers

13
00:00:45.201 --> 00:00:46.250
in the second world war.

14
00:00:46.280 --> 00:00:50.060
Very soon after the struggle to lead the world politically became a source of

15
00:00:50.061 --> 00:00:50.840
contention,

16
00:00:50.840 --> 00:00:54.470
Russia and America started to obsess over learning each other's secrets.

17
00:00:54.471 --> 00:00:58.850
They started Wars against each other secretly with other neighboring countries,

18
00:00:58.851 --> 00:01:02.060
and they even infiltrated some of the most clandestine intelligence

19
00:01:02.061 --> 00:01:03.710
organizations known to man.

20
00:01:03.770 --> 00:01:08.480
John Anthony Walker was a United States Naval officer enlisting in 1955 and

21
00:01:08.481 --> 00:01:13.010
serving in what most thought was a faithful capacity until 1985.

22
00:01:13.011 --> 00:01:16.850
When it was revealed that it was part of aspiring for the Soviet union for close

23
00:01:16.851 --> 00:01:17.780
to 20 years,

24
00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:21.560
the level of sensitive information he gave away to what the world considered

25
00:01:21.561 --> 00:01:25.190
America's enemies was incredibly detailed and wide ranging,

26
00:01:25.191 --> 00:01:28.340
especially in regard to submarine capabilities and locations,

27
00:01:28.341 --> 00:01:31.790
which was something Walker specialized in during the investigation,

28
00:01:31.910 --> 00:01:35.720
it was found that the spiring he was involved with was operating at a high

29
00:01:35.721 --> 00:01:39.740
enough level to literally change the balance of power between the U S and the

30
00:01:39.741 --> 00:01:43.490
Soviet union, and even his own son was involved in the espionage.

31
00:01:43.610 --> 00:01:47.960
Let's look today at the story of John Anthony Walker and how he got lured by

32
00:01:48.140 --> 00:01:52.130
temptation of power, even when it means betraying his own country.

33
00:01:58.850 --> 00:01:58.970
<v 1>[Inaudible].</v>

34
00:01:58.970 --> 00:02:03.620
<v 0>And Sonny Walker was born on July the 28th of 1937 to an Italian American mother</v>

35
00:02:03.830 --> 00:02:07.820
and a father who was a film marketer for Warner brothers as the middle child.

36
00:02:07.821 --> 00:02:09.560
He was raised for a time in Washington,

37
00:02:09.561 --> 00:02:13.100
DC spending his time as an older boy in the local Catholic church.

38
00:02:13.101 --> 00:02:17.150
But the family soon moved to Scranton Pennsylvania. After his alcoholic,

39
00:02:17.151 --> 00:02:19.160
father went bankrupt and lost his job.

40
00:02:19.430 --> 00:02:22.400
The small Pennsylvania town was near John's grandparents.

41
00:02:22.401 --> 00:02:24.680
And while there he took on a paper route,

42
00:02:25.040 --> 00:02:28.220
Asha does a local movie theater and hands hawked home products door to door.

43
00:02:28.400 --> 00:02:31.970
His business acumen enabled him to purchase his own car. At the age of 16,

44
00:02:32.030 --> 00:02:32.840
two years later,

45
00:02:32.840 --> 00:02:35.660
John Anthony Walker made the fateful decisions to join the Navy.

46
00:02:35.720 --> 00:02:38.510
This was not a completely voluntary decision. However,

47
00:02:38.690 --> 00:02:41.110
Walker had recently dropped out of high school and skin,

48
00:02:41.111 --> 00:02:45.500
and the friends had undertaken a slew of burglaries on may the 27th, 1955.

49
00:02:45.830 --> 00:02:47.780
The total whole amounts of do a few tires,

50
00:02:47.900 --> 00:02:50.360
some automobile accessories and a little bit of cash,

51
00:02:50.390 --> 00:02:53.780
but it was enough to get him in the kind of trouble that ended with a police

52
00:02:53.781 --> 00:02:56.690
chase and his eventual arrest, his choice.

53
00:02:56.720 --> 00:02:59.150
Well in list of base jail,

54
00:02:59.710 --> 00:03:03.550
he signed up and became a radio operator serving on a destroyer escort and then

55
00:03:03.551 --> 00:03:07.210
transferring to a full-time crew member aboard the USS Forrestal.

56
00:03:07.390 --> 00:03:09.490
This was no small feat as the forest.

57
00:03:09.640 --> 00:03:12.850
All that was the first American super carrier and it's considered the finest in

58
00:03:12.851 --> 00:03:16.510
its class. In 1957, Walker was on shore leave near Boston.

59
00:03:16.511 --> 00:03:20.140
When he met Barbara Crowley at a dance who would very soon become his wife

60
00:03:20.170 --> 00:03:22.480
within the next three years, they would have three daughters.

61
00:03:23.080 --> 00:03:26.500
Walker went off to qualify at submarine school rising, even higher in the ranks,

62
00:03:26.501 --> 00:03:28.690
but at home things were less than perfect.

63
00:03:28.990 --> 00:03:32.500
It was already resenting having married Barbara and sometimes referred to his

64
00:03:32.501 --> 00:03:33.430
daughters as.

65
00:03:34.180 --> 00:03:38.590
He chose to hang out with his shipmates spending time as a husband and a father

66
00:03:38.591 --> 00:03:42.850
at home. Barbara was desperate to keep him and had another child this time,

67
00:03:42.940 --> 00:03:46.120
that boy John was away at a baseball game instead of with Barbara at the

68
00:03:46.121 --> 00:03:49.240
hospital. So she named him Michael, instead of John Walker.

69
00:03:49.241 --> 00:03:53.230
The third is as part of the wanted still John progressed in his career as the U

70
00:03:53.231 --> 00:03:55.720
S submarine fleet was modernizing in an astounding way.

71
00:03:55.721 --> 00:03:57.640
He was given more and more responsibility.

72
00:03:57.820 --> 00:04:01.540
Walker was given top-level cryptographic clearance and past stringent mental

73
00:04:01.541 --> 00:04:02.291
health tests.

74
00:04:02.291 --> 00:04:06.250
That assured he was capable of being trusted with nuclear weapons in submarine

75
00:04:06.251 --> 00:04:08.920
missions to come far and wide from surveillance missions,

76
00:04:09.130 --> 00:04:11.800
near Russia to nuclear bomb test observations.

77
00:04:11.860 --> 00:04:14.230
He was then assigned to the USS Andrew Jackson.

78
00:04:14.380 --> 00:04:17.710
They high-powered top of the line nuclear submarine in Charleston,

79
00:04:17.711 --> 00:04:21.730
South Carolina. This sub was capable of hitting targets, almost 3000 miles away.

80
00:04:21.820 --> 00:04:24.040
Something the Navy was very proud to admit.

81
00:04:24.041 --> 00:04:28.240
And that's when Walker was granted access to a top secret report that showed

82
00:04:28.241 --> 00:04:32.080
every nuclear target. The United States was considering almost immediately.

83
00:04:32.081 --> 00:04:35.680
John Anthony Walker began to wonder just how much he could gain from sharing

84
00:04:35.681 --> 00:04:37.360
this information with America's enemies.

85
00:04:44.120 --> 00:04:44.910
<v 2>Wallin in South Carolina.</v>

86
00:04:44.910 --> 00:04:48.660
<v 0>No Walker attempted to live a fantasy life of luxury. He opens a bar,</v>

87
00:04:48.690 --> 00:04:51.270
which he was sure would be a hit with all of his Navy buddies,

88
00:04:51.450 --> 00:04:55.080
whom he was still carousing around with. Instead of living a more domestic life,

89
00:04:55.260 --> 00:04:57.000
he was developing an alcohol problem,

90
00:04:57.030 --> 00:05:00.990
much like his father had in the past and running a bar was exactly what he

91
00:05:00.991 --> 00:05:01.824
didn't need.

92
00:05:01.890 --> 00:05:04.800
He was able to get the place started with the financial health of his brother

93
00:05:04.830 --> 00:05:09.150
author, who was also stationed in Charleston and who was also in the Navy almost

94
00:05:09.151 --> 00:05:11.340
instantly. He began hemorrhaging money.

95
00:05:11.460 --> 00:05:15.090
He started taking his troubles out on his wife even more and having affairs with

96
00:05:15.091 --> 00:05:16.170
other women, Barbara,

97
00:05:16.200 --> 00:05:19.830
feeling the weight of his distant coldness initiated in a Farah of her own with

98
00:05:19.980 --> 00:05:22.500
Arthur who had a marriage of his own, this dalliance,

99
00:05:22.680 --> 00:05:25.890
which allegedly go on for over a decade with John being none,

100
00:05:25.891 --> 00:05:29.850
the wiser that his own brother was betraying him. The Navy would call upon.

101
00:05:30.150 --> 00:05:32.940
John's a report to one of its prized fleets in Norfolk, Virginia.

102
00:05:33.150 --> 00:05:34.710
And it would turn out to be, yes.

103
00:05:34.711 --> 00:05:37.500
Another major wall placed between him and his wife.

104
00:05:37.560 --> 00:05:41.130
Barbara decided that she could stay in Charleston with the children and help

105
00:05:41.131 --> 00:05:43.290
manage the Bob. They made a deal. The tip, the ball,

106
00:05:43.291 --> 00:05:45.780
wasn't turning a profit within a year. They would sell it,

107
00:05:46.170 --> 00:05:49.290
walk his promotion to Norfolk and rank promotions. At chief warrant.

108
00:05:49.291 --> 00:05:53.160
Officer allowed him a peek into a whole new level of sensitive information.

109
00:05:53.340 --> 00:05:56.880
It was also around this time that his demeanor towards the Soviet union cooled

110
00:05:56.900 --> 00:05:57.650
quite a bit.

111
00:05:57.650 --> 00:06:01.810
It began to thing that the country was not as insidious and fearful.

112
00:06:01.880 --> 00:06:06.370
His fellow Americans believe the assassination of John F. Kennedy in 1963,

113
00:06:06.371 --> 00:06:07.750
cemented these use for him.

114
00:06:07.840 --> 00:06:11.500
He believed it to be the work of the government to continue to inspire fear in

115
00:06:11.650 --> 00:06:15.670
its people, walk us out the Fosse of the cold war and the absurd war machine.

116
00:06:15.670 --> 00:06:18.760
It spawned was an ever-growing pathetic joke to me.

117
00:06:18.940 --> 00:06:22.360
He eventually took the fateful step that would define the rest of his life.

118
00:06:22.361 --> 00:06:27.340
At this time, he stole a classified document in October of 1967,

119
00:06:27.341 --> 00:06:31.000
Walker first took advantage of his top level position at the Atlantic fleet

120
00:06:31.001 --> 00:06:33.970
submarine headquarters to copy an important documents.

121
00:06:34.030 --> 00:06:37.780
This classified information revealed a key list for cracking codes that the U S

122
00:06:37.781 --> 00:06:41.050
Navy used to scramble its radio transmissions. With this information,

123
00:06:41.051 --> 00:06:44.830
the Soviets could learn submarine positions when an advance and all sorts of

124
00:06:44.831 --> 00:06:49.030
other devastatingly crucial information. Once he stole a copy of the documents,

125
00:06:49.031 --> 00:06:52.420
he traveled North to DC, where he made a stop at the Soviet embassy.

126
00:06:52.480 --> 00:06:54.760
He met with security specialist, Yakov,

127
00:06:55.090 --> 00:06:59.200
Luka severed SU was understandably confused at this Naval officer who stood

128
00:06:59.201 --> 00:07:02.620
before him offering to give up the government secrets in exchange for

129
00:07:02.621 --> 00:07:07.450
compensation, Yakov was leery, but contacted a KGB friend of his bar.

130
00:07:07.450 --> 00:07:11.020
A solid Matton's verify that the information was indeed legitimate.

131
00:07:11.080 --> 00:07:14.470
They were both concerned that it was just too serendipitous that someone would

132
00:07:14.471 --> 00:07:17.920
come to them with a winning lottery ticket. It was too easy.

133
00:07:17.980 --> 00:07:22.180
No one comes into a rival embassy stating that they have national secrets that

134
00:07:22.181 --> 00:07:25.990
they want to give to the enemy country. Except John Anthony Walker apparently.

135
00:07:26.710 --> 00:07:28.150
Well, the Soviets lessons,

136
00:07:28.210 --> 00:07:32.410
the Soviet embassy wins often that's in his documents and we're quite pleased

137
00:07:32.411 --> 00:07:35.620
with what they found it revealed. They told him that they wanted more,

138
00:07:35.860 --> 00:07:36.580
much more.

139
00:07:36.580 --> 00:07:40.180
They asked what he expected it in written walk us that he just wanted money.

140
00:07:40.270 --> 00:07:44.050
The embassy and KGB agents grilled him further to see how committed and,

141
00:07:44.160 --> 00:07:46.480
and trenched in the surveillance world he was.

142
00:07:46.510 --> 00:07:48.580
They wanted to know his marital status.

143
00:07:48.581 --> 00:07:50.560
And if he had a history with drugs and alcohol,

144
00:07:50.800 --> 00:07:54.520
the questions about alcohol may have gotten him riled up or hit home too much.

145
00:07:54.520 --> 00:07:57.850
As he quickly fired back with an offer to work for the Soviets for the rest of

146
00:07:57.851 --> 00:07:58.684
his life.

147
00:07:58.840 --> 00:08:02.350
Walker's requests for financial compensation were a little different than the

148
00:08:02.351 --> 00:08:04.000
Soviets were accustomed to. However,

149
00:08:04.210 --> 00:08:06.970
what he was asking for was basically a steady paycheck.

150
00:08:06.971 --> 00:08:10.390
And since the information he had access to was assumption, importance.

151
00:08:10.690 --> 00:08:13.930
They acquiesced Booker threw out a figure of a thousand dollars a week,

152
00:08:13.931 --> 00:08:15.730
and they actually agreed to it.

153
00:08:15.790 --> 00:08:19.090
They forged a deal where they would give Walker a list of code keys.

154
00:08:19.091 --> 00:08:20.980
They desired and he would steal them.

155
00:08:21.040 --> 00:08:24.850
Then a veritable spy movie scene would take place where Walker would have a

156
00:08:24.851 --> 00:08:28.390
folded magazine cover under one arm while parked outside a strip mall.

157
00:08:28.450 --> 00:08:32.110
A man approached him and gave him instructions on how to hand off the valuable

158
00:08:32.111 --> 00:08:33.850
Intel. Once the handoff took place,

159
00:08:33.851 --> 00:08:37.180
he was handed an envelope stuff with money and then ushered off bond,

160
00:08:37.210 --> 00:08:41.170
unknown men before being dumped in a nondescript residential neighborhood miles

161
00:08:41.171 --> 00:08:41.680
away.

162
00:08:41.680 --> 00:08:46.450
John Anthony Walker was now making money as a bonafide Soviet spy.

163
00:08:46.810 --> 00:08:49.900
Now I promise this is not a good way for you to make money,

164
00:08:49.901 --> 00:08:51.940
but maybe starting a business is,

165
00:08:52.060 --> 00:08:55.590
and that brings me to today's sponsor Squarespace. Now, a couple of things,

166
00:08:55.591 --> 00:08:58.110
maybe you've got an idea for a business sense.

167
00:08:58.260 --> 00:09:01.140
You want to see if it's going to work in the world. Well, too,

168
00:09:01.290 --> 00:09:03.990
the only way to know if its going to work is to get it out there.

169
00:09:04.080 --> 00:09:06.090
And the best way to do that is with a website.

170
00:09:06.091 --> 00:09:07.560
And that's where Squarespace comes in.

171
00:09:07.620 --> 00:09:10.710
Squarespace allows you to create a powerful website for whatever you're up to

172
00:09:10.740 --> 00:09:12.570
want to sell something online. Yes.

173
00:09:12.571 --> 00:09:15.750
It's easy to set up a store with Squarespace. Want to start a podcast,

174
00:09:15.870 --> 00:09:18.870
starting a YouTube channel. Well podcasts, of course,

175
00:09:18.990 --> 00:09:20.880
they handle all of that stuff. And if you've got a YouTube channel,

176
00:09:20.881 --> 00:09:22.620
you're going to want a website to compliments it.

177
00:09:22.680 --> 00:09:26.030
It all starts on Squarespace with a beautiful template that you can customize

178
00:09:26.050 --> 00:09:28.650
your heart's content, or you can start from scratch,

179
00:09:28.680 --> 00:09:31.020
or you can easily move over from an existing domain,

180
00:09:31.021 --> 00:09:34.950
making everything super easy to manage. Don't start from scratch.

181
00:09:35.220 --> 00:09:37.770
Just use a template, no excuses.

182
00:09:37.950 --> 00:09:41.040
And it's once you've gone through the super easy customization process,

183
00:09:41.041 --> 00:09:45.240
there are no updates. There's no patches. There's no tech DS to deal with.

184
00:09:45.350 --> 00:09:49.410
Then Squarespace also handled all of the website stuff like I say, podcasts.

185
00:09:49.440 --> 00:09:51.540
Oh yes, but also mailing lists,

186
00:09:51.630 --> 00:09:55.260
social integrations and much more plus 2,400 customers. The board,

187
00:09:55.261 --> 00:09:57.990
just in case you get confused, but you probably weren't. It's really easy.

188
00:09:58.140 --> 00:10:00.090
Had to squarespace.com for a free trial.

192
00:10:08.461 --> 00:10:09.360
and let's get back to.

193
00:10:16.100 --> 00:10:16.160
<v 3>[Inaudible].</v>

194
00:10:16.160 --> 00:10:18.770
<v 0>So the kids now had a working relationship with Walker.</v>

195
00:10:18.800 --> 00:10:22.880
They still were incredibly careful to make sure that prized cow continued

196
00:10:22.881 --> 00:10:23.960
producing results.

197
00:10:24.020 --> 00:10:28.880
They had KGB agents and former Soviet general early ag collagen assigned to keep

198
00:10:28.881 --> 00:10:32.750
track of walk-up collagen was the man responsible for scoping out the best areas

199
00:10:32.751 --> 00:10:35.440
around Washington DC. Once he scouted an area,

200
00:10:35.450 --> 00:10:39.680
Walker would arrive and cash and intelligence would be traded and literal

201
00:10:39.681 --> 00:10:44.420
countries would inch even closer to nuclear conflict case in 0.1,

202
00:10:44.421 --> 00:10:47.540
such handoff of sensitive military information in 1968,

203
00:10:47.660 --> 00:10:51.500
resulted in the USS Pueblo splice ship being captured by North Korea.

204
00:10:51.680 --> 00:10:55.100
The American Naval ship was then aerated. And the contents sent to Moscow.

205
00:10:55.160 --> 00:10:58.130
The Russians went are deep and American armed services territory.

206
00:10:58.131 --> 00:11:01.310
And most of it was thanks to John Anthony Walker Walker,

207
00:11:01.311 --> 00:11:05.780
whether he knew all of the direct consequences of his actions or not was living

208
00:11:05.781 --> 00:11:06.500
the high life.

209
00:11:06.500 --> 00:11:10.040
He moved to barber and his four kids into a magnificent housing complex in

210
00:11:10.041 --> 00:11:13.790
Norfolk and were spending lavishly despite Russian warnings not to raise

211
00:11:13.791 --> 00:11:14.570
suspicions.

212
00:11:14.570 --> 00:11:18.350
He hired someone to manage his bar back in Charleston that Barbara had been

213
00:11:18.351 --> 00:11:22.160
looking off to the state of that business was still dire and the place was

214
00:11:22.190 --> 00:11:24.470
losing money faster than anyone had anticipated,

215
00:11:24.471 --> 00:11:27.170
but that was just a blip on Walker's radar.

216
00:11:27.200 --> 00:11:30.320
He was simply making too much money to carry on. Notice.

217
00:11:30.350 --> 00:11:34.130
He bought a luxurious sportscar into a huge boat and was shacking up with young

218
00:11:34.131 --> 00:11:37.820
college girls on weekends, even sailing his boat to the Caribbean islands.

219
00:11:37.880 --> 00:11:39.260
Barbara was shocked. However,

220
00:11:39.261 --> 00:11:42.650
when she was going through John's things one night and found some rather

221
00:11:42.651 --> 00:11:47.210
clandestine photographs and written instructions from the hands of KGB agents,

222
00:11:47.240 --> 00:11:50.840
she sat her husband down when he got home and demanded to know what he had

223
00:11:50.841 --> 00:11:54.760
gotten involved in. Surprisingly he, her more surprisingly,

224
00:11:54.970 --> 00:11:56.460
she was intrigued drool.

225
00:11:56.461 --> 00:12:00.390
He was now pulling off acts of worldwide espionage exposed, new,

226
00:12:00.391 --> 00:12:04.320
amazing nuclear submarine technology and changed the way troops at the ground in

227
00:12:04.321 --> 00:12:08.160
Vietnam. Barbara talks about wins and joining John on his next Intel draw.

228
00:12:08.370 --> 00:12:12.210
She credited the slow and painful decline of their marriage to making such a

229
00:12:12.211 --> 00:12:16.590
risky decision and thought somewhere deep down that if she tried to enjoy a

230
00:12:16.591 --> 00:12:20.100
little bit of the spy life too, maybe it would rekindle things with Kapil.

231
00:12:20.250 --> 00:12:21.630
And it might've for a time.

232
00:12:21.840 --> 00:12:25.350
John would be behind the wheel of the car and the two would head off to the

233
00:12:25.351 --> 00:12:28.230
drop-off site with Barbara at ready to jump out and make the swab.

234
00:12:28.320 --> 00:12:31.410
Barbara would even on the wrinkled voted cash. When they got home,

235
00:12:31.470 --> 00:12:34.740
they used an array of tiny cameras and all the Intel they provided to the

236
00:12:34.741 --> 00:12:37.080
Soviets had to fit inside of a soda can,

237
00:12:37.140 --> 00:12:40.500
but the KGB had warned John from the beginning, not to divulge anything,

238
00:12:40.501 --> 00:12:45.210
especially with this family would always come back to haunt him around 1969.

239
00:12:45.210 --> 00:12:49.620
John began being pulled to the West coast as more and better work was opening up

240
00:12:49.621 --> 00:12:50.700
for him in San Diego.

241
00:12:50.760 --> 00:12:54.240
He was to become a mentor of sorts teaching new radio operators,

242
00:12:54.270 --> 00:12:57.390
but that didn't stop him from his thieving treacherous ways.

243
00:12:57.540 --> 00:13:01.020
Since he didn't have the same kind of top level access that he did back East,

244
00:13:01.110 --> 00:13:03.900
you have to rely on a library of classified information to pull from,

245
00:13:04.020 --> 00:13:07.380
which was riskier and more laborious buff. He made it work.

246
00:13:07.560 --> 00:13:09.930
He was becoming a seasoned deft, criminal,

247
00:13:10.050 --> 00:13:12.870
even forged his own security clearance certification.

248
00:13:13.080 --> 00:13:17.010
When he was able to abscond from the San Diego facilities with national secrets,

249
00:13:17.040 --> 00:13:20.550
he had a complex web of Marine gone security checkpoints to navigate.

250
00:13:20.880 --> 00:13:23.850
It was getting harder and harder to cheat on his country.

251
00:13:24.360 --> 00:13:27.510
[inaudible] his pay was changed to reflect the lessening Intel.

252
00:13:27.511 --> 00:13:30.270
He was able to steal bots. He did have an idea.

253
00:13:30.450 --> 00:13:31.980
John befriended a students of his,

254
00:13:32.070 --> 00:13:35.670
that the radio operator training school named Jerry Whitworth. One night,

255
00:13:35.700 --> 00:13:38.490
they went sailing together and he got talking about the recent movie.

256
00:13:38.491 --> 00:13:39.540
Easy rider runs.

257
00:13:39.660 --> 00:13:43.500
The tour began waxing philosophical about making a boatload of money off one big

258
00:13:43.530 --> 00:13:46.680
heist walk. You could tell he already had his hooks in Jerry,

259
00:13:46.710 --> 00:13:48.870
but he waited for years.

260
00:13:48.930 --> 00:13:52.110
John was reassigned somewhere out to see where he could get away from the

261
00:13:52.111 --> 00:13:54.960
family. He didn't want, he had renewed security clearance,

262
00:13:54.961 --> 00:13:58.860
which the Soviet spies loved Barbara began hinting that she wanted to divorce.

263
00:13:58.861 --> 00:14:01.260
But John chums Erin's a remaining in the marriage,

264
00:14:01.261 --> 00:14:03.000
mostly because she could expose him.

265
00:14:03.090 --> 00:14:06.540
So he caught her loose from the spiring and didn't this div Jerry Whitworth.

266
00:14:06.630 --> 00:14:09.840
He turns allianced him with fantastic amounts of money that he could be making,

267
00:14:10.020 --> 00:14:11.580
which with showed some hesitation.

268
00:14:11.581 --> 00:14:14.970
When Walker finally told him it would involve selling secrets to the Russians.

269
00:14:15.180 --> 00:14:18.900
This gentleman calmed him down and said they would also be helping some American

270
00:14:18.901 --> 00:14:22.410
allies like Israel, which Wirth was the perfect foil to,

271
00:14:22.620 --> 00:14:24.270
he had just graduated from the school,

272
00:14:24.510 --> 00:14:27.570
walk a tort and was shipping off to work with satellite communications,

273
00:14:27.571 --> 00:14:31.860
which was its own treasure trove of secrets waiting to be has with Jerry taking

274
00:14:31.861 --> 00:14:35.670
on so much work. Walker moved back to Norfolk and retired from the Navy.

275
00:14:35.760 --> 00:14:39.660
He also finally bid Barbara farewell as the two divorced in 1974.

276
00:14:39.990 --> 00:14:41.640
John's owns to private detective gigs,

277
00:14:41.641 --> 00:14:44.730
but we're still very much under the thumb of the Soviet spiring,

278
00:14:44.940 --> 00:14:47.160
which Wirth was conducting the bulk of the espionage.

279
00:14:47.161 --> 00:14:50.670
But Walker was still doing the drops still, which Wirth was aware of the value.

280
00:14:50.671 --> 00:14:53.840
He was it and began to complain about his lack of compensation.

281
00:14:54.020 --> 00:14:57.890
Walker was already thinking of ways to add to the spiring and began to look to

282
00:14:57.891 --> 00:15:00.530
his own family. His own brother, Arthur joined,

283
00:15:00.531 --> 00:15:02.540
and his began stealing classified documents.

284
00:15:02.600 --> 00:15:05.810
John also began to recruit and talk his youngest child, Michael,

285
00:15:05.811 --> 00:15:09.110
into a life filled with spy adventures. And as Michael adored,

286
00:15:09.111 --> 00:15:11.300
his father had already decided to join the Navy.

287
00:15:17.410 --> 00:15:21.670
John Anthony Walker employed a brilliantly cruel methods to talk his son into

288
00:15:21.671 --> 00:15:23.860
officially spying against the United States.

289
00:15:24.040 --> 00:15:26.770
He brought up one of Michael's favorite movies, the godfather.

290
00:15:27.430 --> 00:15:28.540
<v 2>I'm going to make him an offer.</v>

291
00:15:29.470 --> 00:15:33.400
<v 0>He spoke fantastically about how Michael could take over the family espionage</v>

292
00:15:33.430 --> 00:15:36.430
business, just like his namesake did for the Corleone family.

293
00:15:36.700 --> 00:15:40.060
He even showed Michael his social security card noting that Michael's first

294
00:15:40.061 --> 00:15:43.900
three numbers of his card were double Oh seven, like James Bond himself,

295
00:15:44.080 --> 00:15:46.150
Michael was drunk off the fantasy.

296
00:15:46.270 --> 00:15:49.030
Michael was assigned to the USS Nimitz in 1984,

297
00:15:49.031 --> 00:15:52.540
a state-of-the-art aircraft carrier during his time that he was given the

298
00:15:52.541 --> 00:15:55.480
responsibility of destroying sensitive classified material,

299
00:15:55.600 --> 00:15:57.400
being John Anthony Walker's child, though,

300
00:15:57.401 --> 00:16:00.400
you can guess what he did with that information in stat as right.

301
00:16:00.430 --> 00:16:03.190
He stole them and had his father turn them over to the Russians.

302
00:16:03.250 --> 00:16:07.480
You also cracked safe combinations and tried to shake out every single secret

303
00:16:07.481 --> 00:16:12.100
that the ship had contained within it all for his fava Barbara was finding out

304
00:16:12.101 --> 00:16:15.010
more and more after the divorce that she simply didn't want to know about.

305
00:16:15.070 --> 00:16:18.190
He also wasn't paying alimony despite being flushed with cash.

306
00:16:18.250 --> 00:16:21.850
Barbara was not as blessed financially and was actually staying with us on

307
00:16:21.851 --> 00:16:23.230
Michael and his new wife,

308
00:16:23.320 --> 00:16:26.230
her anger towards her ex-husband spilled into the house.

309
00:16:26.390 --> 00:16:29.590
And Barbara begins telling Michael that she might just rat drawn out to the

310
00:16:29.591 --> 00:16:32.500
federal governments. John used this to his own advantage,

311
00:16:32.530 --> 00:16:36.280
telling Michael that he should tell his mother that he himself was involved in

312
00:16:36.281 --> 00:16:39.340
the spiring. John figured that she would never hurt her own son,

313
00:16:39.341 --> 00:16:41.530
even if he was guilty of treason. Of course,

314
00:16:41.740 --> 00:16:43.600
John was just trying to protect himself.

315
00:16:43.840 --> 00:16:46.780
The thing is like we never told his mother about his own involvement.

316
00:16:46.840 --> 00:16:47.830
So without that knowledge,

317
00:16:47.860 --> 00:16:51.580
Barbara did indeed contact to the Boston FBI office and is often much digging

318
00:16:51.790 --> 00:16:52.623
that enough reasons.

319
00:16:53.050 --> 00:16:56.680
John's phones weeks of surveillance ensued and not a lot was gained.

320
00:16:56.770 --> 00:16:58.840
One may day in 1985. However,

321
00:16:58.841 --> 00:17:02.380
while the FBI was secret becomes outside John Anthony Walker's house,

322
00:17:02.590 --> 00:17:06.820
they finally had paid at Walker was inside putting together a hell of a drop for

323
00:17:06.821 --> 00:17:10.990
the KGB, with names and locations and everything else they could want inside.

324
00:17:11.170 --> 00:17:12.400
When he left to do the handoff,

325
00:17:12.430 --> 00:17:14.470
they followed him after losing him for several hours,

326
00:17:14.471 --> 00:17:17.170
they spotted his van more curiously nearby.

327
00:17:17.200 --> 00:17:20.080
They also observed to sit down with diplomatic plates, belonging,

328
00:17:20.081 --> 00:17:21.730
to a member of the Soviet embassy.

329
00:17:21.790 --> 00:17:24.820
The agents pounced on the drop and all the secrets had held.

330
00:17:24.910 --> 00:17:27.430
John Anthony Walker was arrested at a nearby hotel.

331
00:17:27.760 --> 00:17:31.510
