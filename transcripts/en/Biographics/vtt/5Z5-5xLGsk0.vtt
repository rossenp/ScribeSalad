00:00:18.280 --> 00:00:22.430
I consider Bunco steering more honorable than the life led by the average

5
00:00:22.600 --> 00:00:26.670
politician. These were the words of Jefferson soy Smith,

6
00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:29.670
and he lived by them for almost his entire life.

7
00:00:29.850 --> 00:00:32.310
His name probably isn't very familiar to you,

8
00:00:32.370 --> 00:00:36.630
but soapy Smith might have been the most successful conman of the old west.

9
00:00:37.010 --> 00:00:41.420
He United drifters and gunman into an organization and built a criminal empire

10
00:00:41.421 --> 00:00:43.500
for himself no less than three times.

11
00:00:44.060 --> 00:00:48.940
Whenever a city got too hot for him or the well of suckers began to run dry,

12
00:00:49.700 --> 00:00:54.260
soapy would pack up and move to another place and start again from the ground

13
00:00:54.320 --> 00:00:54.600
up.

14
00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:55.500
<v 1>Unsurprisingly,</v>

15
00:00:55.540 --> 00:00:59.060
a life such as this during those wild frontier days was rife with adventure,

16
00:00:59.720 --> 00:01:03.810
mayhem, and violence to contend with numerous attempts on his life.

17
00:01:03.990 --> 00:01:07.010
He interacted with other popular figures of Western law,

18
00:01:07.011 --> 00:01:11.970
such as bat Masterson and Sam bass. He once barricaded himself inside city hall,

19
00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:15.810
armed with dynamite and fought to a standoff against state militia.

20
00:01:15.870 --> 00:01:19.090
And of course he died guns blazing. So yes,

21
00:01:19.270 --> 00:01:23.360
all the ingredients are there for the thrill tale of soapy Smith.

22
00:01:23.620 --> 00:01:27.640
The man who became known as the king of the frontier conman.

23
00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:37.920
<v 0>He was born Jefferson Randolph Smith. The second, sometime in late 18,</v>

24
00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:41.480
16 near the town of Newan in co county, Georgia.

25
00:01:41.900 --> 00:01:45.670
He actually came from a wealthy family that had quite a bit of influence in the

26
00:01:45.671 --> 00:01:46.100
area.

27
00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:50.230
Smith's grandfather used to be a state legislator and owned a big plantation

28
00:01:50.231 --> 00:01:51.830
while his father was an attorney.

29
00:01:51.940 --> 00:01:55.910
Most of these riches went away while Jeff was still just a toddler though.

30
00:01:55.911 --> 00:01:58.070
When the Americans of a war ravaged the area,

31
00:01:58.250 --> 00:02:00.750
the family struggled to get things to how they were before.

32
00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:02.870
So instead in the mid 1870s,

33
00:02:02.871 --> 00:02:06.860
the they packed up and moved to start a new in round rock, Texas,

34
00:02:07.370 --> 00:02:09.980
even before he embarked on his life. As a grifter Smith,

35
00:02:09.990 --> 00:02:12.380
unwitingly became part of wild west history.

36
00:02:12.381 --> 00:02:16.620
When he witnessed a shootout between Texas Rangers and the notorious outlaw Sam

37
00:02:16.650 --> 00:02:19.820
bass on July, the 19 18 78 bass in his gang,

38
00:02:19.850 --> 00:02:24.490
came around rock into approached by a deputy who them to disarm.

39
00:02:24.490 --> 00:02:27.290
They refused and instead shot the deputy dead.

40
00:02:27.480 --> 00:02:31.090
This prompted a gun fight with Texas Rangers who were also visiting the city

41
00:02:31.260 --> 00:02:35.890
Smith and his cousin Edwin be owners BBO had a front row view for the

42
00:02:35.891 --> 00:02:38.410
proceedings allegedly after one of the Rangers hit bass,

43
00:02:38.411 --> 00:02:42.130
as he was trying to flee Smith, even shouted out. I think you got him.

44
00:02:42.730 --> 00:02:45.800
Sam bass was captured. They to that day, he died of his injuries.

45
00:02:45.940 --> 00:02:50.120
Two days later and was buried in a local cemetery. Smith had a lot of brothers.

46
00:02:50.121 --> 00:02:53.560
Some of them became attorneys like their father. Others became doctors.

47
00:02:53.940 --> 00:02:57.120
One became a farmer and another became a minister. Jeff, however,

48
00:02:57.300 --> 00:03:01.520
seemed destined to turn into the black sheep of the family. As a teenager,

49
00:03:01.700 --> 00:03:05.400
he discovered that people found his demeanor trustworthy and that he could use

50
00:03:05.401 --> 00:03:08.240
this to his advantage. According to one version of the story,

51
00:03:08.370 --> 00:03:12.480
Smith did try honest work for a while. As a cowboy, he might have even studied,

52
00:03:12.481 --> 00:03:14.040
become minister like his older brother,

53
00:03:14.180 --> 00:03:17.840
but all of this changed one day when he encountered a conman,

54
00:03:17.980 --> 00:03:21.630
the swindler took Smith for half of his month salary.

55
00:03:21.780 --> 00:03:24.910
Once he discovered he'd been suckered Smith, wasn't angry though.

56
00:03:25.010 --> 00:03:27.630
He didn't even try to get his money back. Instead.

57
00:03:27.631 --> 00:03:32.150
It was like a whole new world of possibilities had just opened up him like most

58
00:03:32.670 --> 00:03:32.690
trickster.

59
00:03:32.690 --> 00:03:37.310
He started out small the same years that BA Gott shot Smith left the family

60
00:03:37.420 --> 00:03:41.340
home to make his own way. First he moved arounds between country fairs, mining,

61
00:03:41.460 --> 00:03:44.540
a cattle towns and pedal cheap trinkets and fake jewelry.

62
00:03:44.800 --> 00:03:47.260
He also began picking up on classic scams,

63
00:03:47.261 --> 00:03:51.300
like three card Monsi and FLER rig better known today as the shell game,

64
00:03:51.480 --> 00:03:53.940
it was called thimble rig because back in those days,

65
00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:58.300
it was still common to use three th thimbles and pee for corn afterwards using

66
00:03:58.310 --> 00:04:01.770
three Walnut shells game standard practice, hence the name shell game.

67
00:04:01.950 --> 00:04:06.490
But nowadays you are more likely to see swindler employ a ball in three cups.

68
00:04:06.630 --> 00:04:09.730
The materials might have changed, but the con remains the same.

69
00:04:09.870 --> 00:04:14.410
The players or marks to use the correct terminology have to watch closely as the

70
00:04:14.610 --> 00:04:16.250
operator shuffles three containers around.

71
00:04:16.430 --> 00:04:20.480
And then they place a wager on the containers that they think hold of the ball.

72
00:04:20.700 --> 00:04:24.040
It is made to look like a gambling game, perhaps even a game of skill.

73
00:04:24.041 --> 00:04:24.860
But in reality,

74
00:04:24.860 --> 00:04:29.640
the operator uses slight of hands to place the ball wherever they want and avoid

75
00:04:29.641 --> 00:04:31.040
paying out. Obviously,

76
00:04:31.041 --> 00:04:35.400
this was even easier back in the old days when they still used a small P if the

77
00:04:35.401 --> 00:04:36.600
conman had an accomplice,

78
00:04:36.601 --> 00:04:41.190
they might pose as a player and actually win a game to show others that it's and

79
00:04:41.790 --> 00:04:44.830
entice them to try their luck. This person is known as a shell.

80
00:04:51.220 --> 00:04:55.310
Soon enough Smith found his trademark scam known as the price soap bracket.

81
00:04:55.690 --> 00:04:57.830
It would even garner him the nickname soapy,

82
00:04:57.831 --> 00:04:59.670
which stuck around for the rest of his life.

83
00:04:59.671 --> 00:05:03.940
Even though he went on to age and far more ambitious swindles allegedly the

84
00:05:03.941 --> 00:05:07.740
Monica came from a police officer who arrested Smith for his price soap bracket,

85
00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:11.180
unable to remember the swindlers name. He just wrote down soapy.

86
00:05:11.181 --> 00:05:13.700
There is no solid evidence to suggest this ever happens,

87
00:05:13.840 --> 00:05:16.900
but I suppose it says good origin story is Annie.

88
00:05:16.960 --> 00:05:18.340
So here's how the trick worked.

89
00:05:18.470 --> 00:05:20.780
Smith presents in himself as a humble soap salesman,

90
00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:25.650
who in order to boost his sales had hidden several bills of various nominations

91
00:05:25.830 --> 00:05:28.170
inside the rappers of some of his products.

92
00:05:28.270 --> 00:05:32.690
Anyone who bought a soap from him had a chance to win their money. 10 20,

93
00:05:32.720 --> 00:05:37.290
sometimes even 50 times over if they were lucky enough to win the big prize,

94
00:05:37.291 --> 00:05:42.010
which was usually a 50 or $100 bill soapy first started using this scam in,

95
00:05:42.100 --> 00:05:43.000
in Leadville, Colorado.

96
00:05:43.270 --> 00:05:46.800
Initially the bars of soap were cheap somewhere around $1, however,

97
00:05:47.140 --> 00:05:51.120
as the supplied dwindled and many bars of soap with prizes and sideway yet to be

98
00:05:51.121 --> 00:05:53.400
claimed the price increased. Eventually,

99
00:05:53.500 --> 00:05:56.440
if there were only a few bars left and nobody won the big prize,

100
00:05:56.460 --> 00:05:59.800
yet those soaps would be auctioned off and go to the highest bidders.

101
00:05:59.950 --> 00:06:01.960
More importantly, they had to win them in loud,

102
00:06:02.210 --> 00:06:06.160
overt ways in front of everyone to show other people that the giveaways were

103
00:06:06.250 --> 00:06:09.240
legit and encourage them to try their luck. Of course,

104
00:06:09.241 --> 00:06:13.360
the swindle would not be very profitable if soy actually awarded hundreds of

105
00:06:13.361 --> 00:06:17.990
dollars in prizes every day. So obviously the big winners were his shells,

106
00:06:18.280 --> 00:06:22.270
Smith used slight of hand and other tricks to ensure that the soap buzz with the

107
00:06:22.271 --> 00:06:24.830
large bells ended up in the hands of his accomplices.

108
00:06:25.130 --> 00:06:28.310
As far as the rappers with the smaller denominations were concerned,

109
00:06:28.311 --> 00:06:32.070
those probably did end up with a few lucky buyers. It worked in soap.

110
00:06:32.071 --> 00:06:35.190
Piece's favor to give those to real customers. For two reasons,

111
00:06:35.330 --> 00:06:37.540
it helped spread word of his content stunned.

112
00:06:37.620 --> 00:06:40.340
It meant that he required fewer shells to keep the scam going.

113
00:06:40.560 --> 00:06:43.180
The soap brackets helped Smith Reagan, a tiny profits,

114
00:06:43.181 --> 00:06:45.780
but he had his site set a bit higher and soon enough,

115
00:06:45.880 --> 00:06:47.540
he left Leadville for Denver.

116
00:06:47.760 --> 00:06:50.380

137
00:08:01.640 --> 00:08:04.740
In 1879, Sophie headed for the big leagues of Denver,

138
00:08:04.960 --> 00:08:08.860
the first of three cities where he would build his thriving criminal enterprise

139
00:08:08.890 --> 00:08:12.620
from the ground up. Denver proved to be a Haven for people like him.

140
00:08:12.980 --> 00:08:15.420
It not only had a relaxed attitude towards gambling,

141
00:08:15.600 --> 00:08:19.060
but it was a city in the midst of a population. Boom,

142
00:08:19.970 --> 00:08:22.570
there were always fresh new targets coming off the train,

143
00:08:22.880 --> 00:08:24.890
just waiting to lose all their money.

144
00:08:25.150 --> 00:08:29.050
At first Smith stuck to the soap bracket and other small time cons that he was

145
00:08:29.250 --> 00:08:29.710
familiar with.

146
00:08:29.710 --> 00:08:34.370
But with time he started branching out into a more executive role.

147
00:08:34.510 --> 00:08:39.290
He began uniting all the swindlers con card sharks and other men of dubious

148
00:08:39.340 --> 00:08:43.760
reputation. &lt;affirmative&gt; into a more cohesive organization with him. Of course,

149
00:08:43.940 --> 00:08:45.640
at the top in just a few years,

150
00:08:46.240 --> 00:08:49.880
soy Smith had formed a criminal empire and became the king of Denvers

151
00:08:49.881 --> 00:08:50.580
underworld.

152
00:08:50.580 --> 00:08:53.760
We should take a minute here to mention that Smith did not really fit the

153
00:08:53.761 --> 00:08:57.320
stereotype that we have of the typical conman who is smooth, charming,

154
00:08:57.770 --> 00:09:00.520
nonviolent, and prefers flight over fight.

155
00:09:00.760 --> 00:09:04.120
Whenever there is a need for a quick getaway soy, he wasn't like that.

156
00:09:04.260 --> 00:09:08.720
He was a violence man whose demeanor and behavior were more Akins that of a

157
00:09:08.721 --> 00:09:11.800
gangster. Especially once he started gaining some real power,

158
00:09:11.980 --> 00:09:16.630
he was a mean drunk and he became quite known and feared for his bad

159
00:09:16.631 --> 00:09:17.290
temper.

160
00:09:17.290 --> 00:09:20.950
He had a lot of other Savage men in his employee who weren't there to run cons

161
00:09:21.190 --> 00:09:24.030
on people, but to make sure that his gang had the other hands,

162
00:09:24.050 --> 00:09:27.990
if things escalated to violence, these situations occurred rather frequently,

163
00:09:28.090 --> 00:09:31.830
not only when angry mark wanted revenge after realizing that they had been

164
00:09:31.950 --> 00:09:36.420
swindled, but also when other crooks tried to muscle Lynn on soys territory,

165
00:09:36.490 --> 00:09:39.260
outwardly Smith liked to portray himself as a man of the community.

166
00:09:39.260 --> 00:09:42.740
Similar to mob bosses, like Al Capone, who would follow in his footsteps,

167
00:09:42.760 --> 00:09:46.780
heated generously to charities and churches got involved in community projects,

168
00:09:46.781 --> 00:09:50.900
closed his saloons on Sundays and helped people in neat at the height of his

169
00:09:50.901 --> 00:09:55.020
power in Denver, soy had around a hundred men in his employ. More importantly,

170
00:09:55.021 --> 00:09:58.050
he had the police and politicians in his pocket.

171
00:09:58.360 --> 00:10:00.810
Most patrolling cops were paid off and left.

172
00:10:00.870 --> 00:10:02.770
Soap's men alone to operate with impunity.

173
00:10:03.150 --> 00:10:06.490
The ones who weren't crooked knew that there was nothing they could do.

174
00:10:06.600 --> 00:10:09.970
Even if they arrested the con men, they would soon be released.

175
00:10:09.971 --> 00:10:12.210
Thanks to a combination of witnesses, attorneys,

176
00:10:12.550 --> 00:10:15.890
and politicians who were standing by and ready to assist.

177
00:10:16.370 --> 00:10:20.760
Inevitably soapy wanted to expand his criminal empire regardless of how many

178
00:10:20.920 --> 00:10:23.640
many he had under him. There was a limit how much money he could make.

179
00:10:23.700 --> 00:10:25.440
If all they did was small time.

180
00:10:25.510 --> 00:10:28.240
Cons Smith opened several saloons and gambling halls.

181
00:10:28.241 --> 00:10:32.720
The most famous of which was the Oli club in 1888, according to popular legends,

182
00:10:32.721 --> 00:10:35.360
the bar had a sign above the entrance to the gambling parlor,

183
00:10:35.361 --> 00:10:37.310
which fittingly San caveat

184
00:10:39.150 --> 00:10:42.990
ware soapy also opens fake lottery officers and stock exchanges.

185
00:10:43.210 --> 00:10:45.550
If one of them was being exposed as fraudulent,

186
00:10:45.810 --> 00:10:49.310
he would simply close up shop and reopen it in another place.

187
00:10:49.610 --> 00:10:53.390
His younger brother, Bascom Smith joined his operation and ran a cigars store,

188
00:10:53.391 --> 00:10:56.950
which was a front for various swindles that took place in the back room.

189
00:10:57.360 --> 00:11:01.420
It was also at this time that soapy Smith began rubbing elbows with some of the

190
00:11:01.421 --> 00:11:02.980
other famed figures of the old west.

191
00:11:03.200 --> 00:11:06.460
One of them was Texas Jack Vermillion gun fighter,

192
00:11:06.560 --> 00:11:09.620
who was best known for participating in the notorious, uh,

193
00:11:09.621 --> 00:11:13.980
vendetta ride when right up and his associates took revenge against the men who

194
00:11:13.981 --> 00:11:15.740
attacked his brothers. Incidentally,

195
00:11:15.741 --> 00:11:19.410
if you'd like to know more about this renowned episode of Western law,

196
00:11:19.550 --> 00:11:22.890
you can learn all about it. In our episode on WT up,

197
00:11:23.150 --> 00:11:24.970
it would seem that around 1888,

198
00:11:25.330 --> 00:11:29.050
famil made his way to Denver and joined up with soap's gang. The following year,

199
00:11:29.051 --> 00:11:31.210
they were involved in a shootout in Pello,

200
00:11:31.211 --> 00:11:35.130
Idaho against arrival Bunco gang that tried to kill Smith,

201
00:11:35.450 --> 00:11:37.770
a famil drifted away to other parts.

202
00:11:38.080 --> 00:11:41.920
Soon after another world west icon who made Smith's acquaintance was bat

203
00:11:42.640 --> 00:11:44.520
Masterson. He was a car dealer in Denver for a while,

204
00:11:44.660 --> 00:11:46.400
and worked in soapy saloons.

205
00:11:46.401 --> 00:11:49.760
The two of them established a relationship that continued even after Smith

206
00:11:49.761 --> 00:11:51.760
decided that it was time to leave Denver.

207
00:11:52.030 --> 00:11:54.720
That moment didn't happen for quite a while though, by nature,

208
00:11:55.040 --> 00:11:59.440
a con man lives the life of a drifter and does not spend a lot of time in the

209
00:11:59.441 --> 00:12:03.160
same city, thanks to his powerful criminal empire in his connections. However,

210
00:12:03.570 --> 00:12:05.640
Smith spent over a decade in Denver.

211
00:12:05.940 --> 00:12:09.680
He even got married at one point to a woman named Mary noon and had kids.

212
00:12:09.820 --> 00:12:12.910
He was actually pretty successful in keeping his two worlds of parties.

213
00:12:13.330 --> 00:12:15.950
He told his wife to never ask him about his business.

214
00:12:16.270 --> 00:12:20.150
While most of his associates said no idea that he was even married Smith.

215
00:12:20.151 --> 00:12:22.270
Didn't manage it completely though. At one point,

216
00:12:22.370 --> 00:12:25.470
the Rocky mans in news published an article talking about his family,

217
00:12:25.471 --> 00:12:29.070
which finally made his worlds collide. He was so angry about this,

218
00:12:29.071 --> 00:12:33.260
that he attacked the newspaper editor with his cane so badly that he should,

219
00:12:33.261 --> 00:12:36.500
the man's skull was arrested and charged with attempted murder.

220
00:12:36.560 --> 00:12:40.380
And even though he got off the media started focusing more and more on his

221
00:12:40.500 --> 00:12:41.320
criminal empire.

222
00:12:41.320 --> 00:12:46.140
He looked in shadows as black as his soul was a memorable line

223
00:12:46.380 --> 00:12:49.900
news to describe Smith newspapers often made mention of his close ties to

224
00:12:49.901 --> 00:12:54.450
Denver's mayor London, S police chief Farley by Dively naming the trio,

225
00:12:54.590 --> 00:12:57.050
the firm of Londoner, Farley and Smith.

226
00:12:57.180 --> 00:13:00.650
Eventually the mayor and the police chief lost their jobs in new city.

227
00:13:00.651 --> 00:13:03.810
Officials began enacting anti-gambling reforms. A good con man.

228
00:13:03.870 --> 00:13:07.890
He knows when to cut Baan run and Smith did just that relocating to the mining

229
00:13:07.920 --> 00:13:09.370
boom town of creed, Colorado.

230
00:13:15.940 --> 00:13:18.600
As soon as soy arrived in creed in 1892,

231
00:13:18.700 --> 00:13:22.920
he enacted his plan to take over the town was small, but growing by the minute,

232
00:13:22.990 --> 00:13:27.240
therefore so's main concern was to obtain as many properties as possible on

233
00:13:27.241 --> 00:13:29.080
Creed's main street. Allegedly,

234
00:13:29.081 --> 00:13:33.320
he did this by bringing in Denver prostitutes who used their charms to persuade

235
00:13:33.720 --> 00:13:35.430
other men to sign and over their leases.

236
00:13:35.570 --> 00:13:38.990
An interesting episode was the addition of William Sidney light,

237
00:13:38.991 --> 00:13:43.510
better known as cap to Sophie's gang cap was a lawman who seemingly had an

238
00:13:43.511 --> 00:13:47.350
exemplary record in law enforcement. He was also Smith's brother in law.

239
00:13:47.640 --> 00:13:49.630
After Sophie became the new boss in town.

240
00:13:49.650 --> 00:13:52.470
He convinced cap to take over as the deputy Marshall.

241
00:13:52.800 --> 00:13:55.300
We're not exactly sure what the arrangement will was.

242
00:13:55.520 --> 00:13:58.420
Did cap actually think he was going to clean up creed?

243
00:13:58.560 --> 00:14:02.780
Did he realize that he was only there to serve as muscle for his brother-in-law?

244
00:14:02.880 --> 00:14:05.940
We just don't know, but either way the gig didn't last long,

245
00:14:05.941 --> 00:14:09.620
just a few months after taking the position of Marshall cap confronted a drunk

246
00:14:09.940 --> 00:14:13.260
car dealer named William McCann who was shooting his gun in the street

247
00:14:13.370 --> 00:14:16.530
predictably, a gun fight, ensued and cap killed McCann.

248
00:14:16.640 --> 00:14:20.330
Even though the coroner jury concluded that it was justified cap quit.

249
00:14:20.360 --> 00:14:24.730
Soon after cap's final demise came a year later in a very bizarre way.

250
00:14:24.830 --> 00:14:27.330
During a court hearing a man named Coggins,

251
00:14:27.331 --> 00:14:29.850
pulled out a revolver and shot him in the head twice.

252
00:14:30.070 --> 00:14:31.290
His injuries were very bad,

253
00:14:31.390 --> 00:14:35.930
but cap actually survived later that year cap was riding a train alone and he

254
00:14:36.320 --> 00:14:39.480
accidentally discharged his gun in his pocket. The bullets hit him in the leg,

255
00:14:39.550 --> 00:14:43.360
severed his femoral artery and cap bled to death in a matter of minutes.

256
00:14:44.020 --> 00:14:47.920
So back to Smith, he wasted no time in gaining control of creed.

257
00:14:48.060 --> 00:14:52.400
His main competition was a saloon called Ford's exchange operated by Robert

258
00:14:52.400 --> 00:14:54.840
Ford. The notorious outlaw who killed Jesse James,

259
00:14:55.180 --> 00:14:59.400
the timing worked out great for soy though was Ford himself was assassinated on

260
00:14:59.401 --> 00:15:02.920
June the eighth, 1892 by Edward K Parto Kelly,

261
00:15:03.270 --> 00:15:07.320
thus making it a lot easier for Smith to establish his own presence in town.

262
00:15:07.470 --> 00:15:11.350
Many have alleged that soy was ultimately by behind Ford's death,

263
00:15:11.550 --> 00:15:13.350
as he convinced Oak Kelly to do the deed.

264
00:15:13.410 --> 00:15:17.190
But there's no evidence ATEST to that idea. Not before long,

265
00:15:17.290 --> 00:15:19.430
all saloons in town paid tribute to Smith,

266
00:15:19.730 --> 00:15:22.390
all except won the Denver exchange.

267
00:15:22.770 --> 00:15:27.310
The reason this establishment escaped soap's grasp was because it was managed by

268
00:15:27.311 --> 00:15:31.380
bat Masterson. We don't know if it was because of friendship, respect, or fear,

269
00:15:31.520 --> 00:15:35.860
but Smith never tried to mess with masters and saloon and even gambled there on

270
00:15:36.060 --> 00:15:40.020
occasion during his time in creed Smith enacted all of his usual scams and

271
00:15:40.040 --> 00:15:42.260
frauds, but there was also a new one,

272
00:15:42.261 --> 00:15:44.580
which was strange enough that it merits mention.

273
00:15:45.180 --> 00:15:48.700
So he got his hands on a petrified man. He named it McGinty hens,

274
00:15:48.701 --> 00:15:50.380
put it on display in an exhibition.

275
00:15:50.480 --> 00:15:53.010
It only costs people 10 cents to see the oddity,

276
00:15:53.011 --> 00:15:54.690
but while they were waiting in line,

277
00:15:55.010 --> 00:15:58.810
there were shell and card games available to help them pass the time and spend

278
00:15:58.811 --> 00:16:00.450
some money. Two, three,

279
00:16:05.480 --> 00:16:09.210
Meanwhile in Denver city officials realized that cleaning up the town had

280
00:16:09.370 --> 00:16:11.930
actually been terrible for business. They wanted Smith and,

281
00:16:12.060 --> 00:16:13.560
and all of his associates back.

282
00:16:13.580 --> 00:16:16.880
And fortunately for all involved the time he worked out great.

283
00:16:17.050 --> 00:16:18.240
After a growth spurt,

284
00:16:18.260 --> 00:16:22.880
the boom town of creed had lost its boom ands was now just a regular town.

285
00:16:23.060 --> 00:16:25.520
Not to mention that a great fire destroyed many buildings,

286
00:16:25.521 --> 00:16:28.000
including soys main headquarters Smith.

287
00:16:28.220 --> 00:16:32.440
He was looking to relocate again with minimal effort. Soy was back running scam,

288
00:16:32.870 --> 00:16:35.910
AMS and grats in Denver. The good times didn't last long though.

289
00:16:35.911 --> 00:16:38.870
While city officials were happy that Smith was back to his old ways.

290
00:16:39.090 --> 00:16:42.710
The new Colorado governor David Hansen wait, was not.

291
00:16:42.930 --> 00:16:46.830
He was elected on an anti-corruption platform and proceeded to fire the top

292
00:16:46.831 --> 00:16:50.350
Denver officials that he considered responsible for corruption in the city,

293
00:16:50.650 --> 00:16:51.370
in response,

294
00:16:51.370 --> 00:16:55.380
the officials and many of their associates barricaded themselves inside Denver

295
00:16:55.410 --> 00:16:56.170
city hall.

296
00:16:56.170 --> 00:17:00.460
They called on Smith for assistance and even made him deputy sheriff intern.

297
00:17:00.520 --> 00:17:04.980
He joined them inside the hall and brought his men who are armed with rifles and

298
00:17:04.981 --> 00:17:06.260
dynamite. Consequently,

299
00:17:06.320 --> 00:17:09.780
the governor brought in the state militia in an event commemorated in the media

300
00:17:10.160 --> 00:17:13.500
as the Denver city hall war. It may have been called a,

301
00:17:13.710 --> 00:17:17.570
but if anyone actually opens fire, it would've been a massacre, not a wall.

302
00:17:17.710 --> 00:17:20.490
The men inside the building might have been armed with rifles,

303
00:17:20.630 --> 00:17:24.890
but the militia had cannons and Gatling guns. So be, and his men,

304
00:17:24.920 --> 00:17:28.050
they would've been slotted. Fortunately for them cooler heads prevailed.

305
00:17:28.051 --> 00:17:30.050
And the governor decided to withdraw the militia.

306
00:17:30.110 --> 00:17:33.210
The courts eventually sided with him and the Denver officials.

307
00:17:33.440 --> 00:17:36.400
They stayed had fired with his political protection. Gone.

308
00:17:36.880 --> 00:17:38.920
Soy lost a lot of territory to his competition.

309
00:17:38.980 --> 00:17:42.680
Mainly a gang run by the brothers in 1895,

310
00:17:43.080 --> 00:17:45.680
soy and BA got in trouble after beating up a saloon owner.

311
00:17:46.020 --> 00:17:50.040
His brother was put in jail for attempted murder while soy was forced to flee to

312
00:17:50.041 --> 00:17:50.874
Denver

313
00:17:56.470 --> 00:17:58.840
With no other choice, Smith relocated again,

314
00:17:58.850 --> 00:18:02.000
after drifting unsuccessfully from place to place for a few years,

315
00:18:02.100 --> 00:18:03.400
he settled on ska way.

316
00:18:03.401 --> 00:18:07.640
Alaska looking to take advantage of the Kloni gold rush Smith operated in the

317
00:18:07.641 --> 00:18:07.921
same way.

318
00:18:07.921 --> 00:18:12.510
As before he used the resources at his disposal to gather allies for his

319
00:18:12.511 --> 00:18:15.190
eventual takeover. He put the town Marshall on his payroll.

320
00:18:15.450 --> 00:18:19.390
He hired henchman who started running various cons, such as fixed card games.

321
00:18:19.650 --> 00:18:22.430
He even added a fake Telegraph office to his repertoire.

322
00:18:22.431 --> 00:18:23.830
Clients would pay the fees,

323
00:18:23.970 --> 00:18:27.630
but they never noticed that the wires went inside the wall that didn't come out

324
00:18:27.631 --> 00:18:31.180
on the other side and of the course while they were waiting for a reply,

325
00:18:31.181 --> 00:18:35.180
there were more than a few friendly characters around who enticed them to play a

326
00:18:35.181 --> 00:18:39.700
few games to pass the time soy opened a saloon called Jeff Smith's par,

327
00:18:39.710 --> 00:18:43.260
which functioned as his base operations. According to a description,

328
00:18:43.280 --> 00:18:47.340
it looked innocent enough. It had a main bar and a restaurant. And in the back,

329
00:18:47.700 --> 00:18:52.410
there was a parlor as pretty and as a lady's OI where Marx

330
00:18:52.411 --> 00:18:55.410
would lose all their money outside. There was a small M empty yard,

331
00:18:55.411 --> 00:18:58.690
which had a secret exit. So soapy men could make a quick getaway.

332
00:18:58.691 --> 00:19:02.890
If they got made, the saloon still stands today and operates as a museum.

333
00:19:03.310 --> 00:19:05.210
Not everyone welcomes soapy with open arms,

334
00:19:05.240 --> 00:19:08.970
even though he continued his tradition of making generous donations to portray

335
00:19:08.971 --> 00:19:10.600
himself as a pillar of the community,

336
00:19:10.960 --> 00:19:13.440
a vigilance committee known as the committee of 1 0 1,

337
00:19:13.500 --> 00:19:15.920
wanted to throw him out of town in reply.

338
00:19:15.940 --> 00:19:20.360
So he formed his own law and order committee of three 17 to ensure that justice

339
00:19:20.410 --> 00:19:22.600
would be dealt out to its full extent.

340
00:19:22.830 --> 00:19:26.520
It's unclear if Smith actually had 317 men under his commands,

341
00:19:26.521 --> 00:19:27.920
but based on later arrest,

342
00:19:28.230 --> 00:19:32.710
it's highly unlikely that his gang numbered more than a few dozen Smith lasted

343
00:19:32.740 --> 00:19:36.990
less than a year in sag way before his bad temper finally became the end of him.

344
00:19:37.270 --> 00:19:41.110
A minor called John Stewarts was causing a ruckus in town about losing his gold

345
00:19:41.111 --> 00:19:44.230
in one of soapy scams, nothing outta the ordinary so far,

346
00:19:44.370 --> 00:19:47.950
but Stewart was being far more vocal than your average mark.

347
00:19:48.290 --> 00:19:52.620
He had the support of the committee of 1 0 1 on July, the 8, 18 98.

348
00:19:52.640 --> 00:19:56.340
The committee held a meeting on Juno Wharf that Smith decided to crash.

349
00:19:56.520 --> 00:20:00.220
He left his men behind concluding that his Winchester rifle was all the

350
00:20:00.221 --> 00:20:03.740
persuasion he needed to get an invite. Turns out he was wrong.

351
00:20:03.840 --> 00:20:06.220
The committee placed four guards at the entry to the Wharf.

352
00:20:06.360 --> 00:20:10.140
One of them named Frank Reed blocked Sophie's entrance Smith tried to hit him

353
00:20:10.141 --> 00:20:10.974
with a part of his rifle,

354
00:20:11.000 --> 00:20:14.690
but caught it with one hand and pulled out his revolver with the other.

355
00:20:14.870 --> 00:20:18.170
He shot the grifter. He had time to shoot him back before collapsing.

356
00:20:18.280 --> 00:20:22.130
Some say another guard named Jesse Murphy fired the fatal shot either way.

357
00:20:22.300 --> 00:20:25.650
Soapy Smith died on the spot while Reed succumb to his wounds.

358
00:20:25.651 --> 00:20:29.330
12 days later with soapy dead, his gang wasn't so scary anymore.

359
00:20:29.390 --> 00:20:33.440
The towns spoke BN rounding up all of the swindler and it was only the timely

360
00:20:33.441 --> 00:20:37.240
arrival of the us army infantry that saved some of them from being lynched.

361
00:20:37.340 --> 00:20:40.800
The prominent members of the gang were put in prison while the rest were thrown

362
00:20:40.801 --> 00:20:44.080
out of town. So I really hope you found that video. Interesting. If you did,
