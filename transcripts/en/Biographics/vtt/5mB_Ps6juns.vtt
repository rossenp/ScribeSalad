00:00:18.220 --> 00:00:23.190
In the 125 years since Alfred Nobel's estate first established the Nobel prize.

6
00:00:23.260 --> 00:00:28.230
Cambridge university has had a remarkable group of laureates on it for their

7
00:00:28.231 --> 00:00:28.480
work.

8
00:00:28.480 --> 00:00:32.070
Their names are synonymous with excellence and innovation merchant Russell,

9
00:00:32.510 --> 00:00:34.550
Francis Creek Neils bore Milton Friedman.

10
00:00:34.551 --> 00:00:37.310
There are literally a hundred more yet,

11
00:00:37.340 --> 00:00:40.590
despite all those brilliant minds that have walked the Cambridge ground,

12
00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:44.100
one of them has ever won two Nobel prizes.

13
00:00:44.240 --> 00:00:46.180
He marched into an unknown branch of science,

14
00:00:46.270 --> 00:00:51.180
which few even knew existed at the time and blazed a trail for those

15
00:00:51.440 --> 00:00:52.420
who would come after him.

16
00:00:52.560 --> 00:00:56.260
He wildly expanded the definitions of what we knew about genetics and human

17
00:00:56.261 --> 00:00:57.000
existence.

18
00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:01.970
He kickstarted a scientific revolution that has raged well into the 20 de first

19
00:01:01.971 --> 00:01:02.710
century.

20
00:01:02.710 --> 00:01:06.970
And incredibly he did all of that with the humility of a man who was just

21
00:01:06.971 --> 00:01:09.810
tinkering with some toys in his garage.

22
00:01:10.190 --> 00:01:15.090
His name was Frederick Sanger and his brilliant career in biochemistry

23
00:01:15.470 --> 00:01:16.890
shaped the modern world.

24
00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:25.320
Frederick Sanger was born August the 13th,

25
00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:28.400
1918 in the village of Renco in lost share England.

26
00:01:28.460 --> 00:01:32.440
His father who was also named Frederick was a physician who had studied St.

27
00:01:32.441 --> 00:01:33.001
John's college.

28
00:01:33.001 --> 00:01:37.320
Cambridge Freds was something of an innovation himself long before his son

29
00:01:37.321 --> 00:01:39.480
started investigating peptide chains.

30
00:01:39.640 --> 00:01:43.110
He worked with Scotland de ya to develop a forensic test would differentiate

31
00:01:43.220 --> 00:01:47.110
between human blood and animal blood more than a decade before he had any

32
00:01:47.270 --> 00:01:50.990
children. Fred S traveled to China as an Anglican medical missionary.

33
00:01:51.170 --> 00:01:53.510
<v 5>He served a local community in a mission hospital,</v>

34
00:01:53.580 --> 00:01:55.550
spreading the gospel wherever he could,

35
00:01:55.850 --> 00:02:00.230
but in 1912 with the country on the brink of revolution and Frederick in poor

36
00:02:00.231 --> 00:02:02.910
health, he returned to England to open his own practice.

37
00:02:03.520 --> 00:02:05.740
It was here that he met the love of his life.

38
00:02:05.930 --> 00:02:09.140
Cecille Croson in the most romantic way possible.

39
00:02:09.400 --> 00:02:11.860
He was called to treat her septic finger.

40
00:02:12.050 --> 00:02:15.740
<v 0>They married in 1916 and Cecille gave birth to two sons,</v>

41
00:02:16.090 --> 00:02:18.420
Theo and Frederick over the next two years,

42
00:02:18.890 --> 00:02:23.850
Fred Sr and Theo both had a tremendous impact on the direction of Frederick his

43
00:02:23.920 --> 00:02:25.410
life, Theo love nature.

44
00:02:25.590 --> 00:02:29.650
And so he often brought along his younger brother for outdoor adventures and

45
00:02:29.651 --> 00:02:30.570
animal investigations.

46
00:02:31.030 --> 00:02:35.650
The boys would hunt for nuts in the family pond or SCO the yard for birds nest

47
00:02:35.800 --> 00:02:37.970
between his father, the doctor, and his brother,

48
00:02:38.070 --> 00:02:41.810
the naturalist Frederick couldn't help, but develop a scientific curiosity,

49
00:02:42.130 --> 00:02:45.400
a thirst for discovering the nature of things,

50
00:02:45.550 --> 00:02:47.560
whether they intended to or not.

51
00:02:47.580 --> 00:02:51.120
The elder men of his household pushed him towards rational investigation,

52
00:02:51.630 --> 00:02:55.760
even at a young age. The other early influence on Frederick's life was religion.

53
00:02:56.160 --> 00:02:59.720
Although his father had left China as a Protestant by the time Theo and

54
00:02:59.920 --> 00:03:01.560
Frederick were running around the yard,

55
00:03:01.660 --> 00:03:04.320
the household had distinct Quaker influences.

56
00:03:04.640 --> 00:03:08.400
Cecily's father was a wealthy cotton merchants. And when he passed away,

57
00:03:08.420 --> 00:03:11.440
he left the Sangers both money and religious reading material,

58
00:03:11.470 --> 00:03:13.280
perhaps because of his time in China,

59
00:03:13.281 --> 00:03:17.480
which featured simmering revolutionary violence and distrust of Protestant

60
00:03:17.481 --> 00:03:21.470
missionaries, senior founds, the Quaker perspective appealing he converted.

61
00:03:21.530 --> 00:03:26.150
And in 1923, he moved the now family of five to tan worth in Arden,

62
00:03:26.300 --> 00:03:29.550
near Birmingham, to be close to a stronger Quaker community.

63
00:03:30.150 --> 00:03:34.510
Quaker believes colored most aspects of young Frederick's childhood. Hi,

64
00:03:34.710 --> 00:03:36.950
his siblings were always taught to say their prayers.

65
00:03:37.100 --> 00:03:38.350
When they reached school age,

66
00:03:38.351 --> 00:03:43.140
Frederick was tutored by a Quaker governance in 1927. At the age of nine,

67
00:03:43.141 --> 00:03:46.100
Frederick was shipped off to boarding school, his destination,

68
00:03:46.420 --> 00:03:49.340
a Quaker school known then as Down's proprietary school,

69
00:03:49.560 --> 00:03:51.460
he stayed there until 1932.

70
00:03:51.461 --> 00:03:54.860
When he began boarding at Branston school endorse it.

71
00:03:55.120 --> 00:03:57.980
It was a Branston where Sanger's Quaker roots,

72
00:03:57.990 --> 00:04:01.290
where finally joins his butting love science

73
00:04:07.750 --> 00:04:12.050
At Branston Sanger began to flourishes the students of the sciences Branston

74
00:04:12.330 --> 00:04:15.490
operators on a less structured educational system than many of its peer

75
00:04:15.491 --> 00:04:16.610
institutions. At the time,

76
00:04:16.680 --> 00:04:20.720
instead of crushing its pupils with structure and discipline school allowed

77
00:04:20.721 --> 00:04:22.760
students to work on a more flexible schedule,

78
00:04:22.761 --> 00:04:26.920
offering free periods and allowing the boys themselves to prioritize which

79
00:04:26.921 --> 00:04:28.360
subjects they wanted to focus on.

80
00:04:28.800 --> 00:04:29.041
<v 5>Additionally,</v>

81
00:04:29.041 --> 00:04:33.240
there was a new headmaster thorough code who eliminated the popular practice of

82
00:04:33.241 --> 00:04:37.400
beating instead as administration chose to emphasize growth through self

83
00:04:37.401 --> 00:04:37.980
discipline.

84
00:04:37.980 --> 00:04:41.870
So while the school has a record of some boys taking advantage of their new

85
00:04:41.871 --> 00:04:43.750
freedom by lolly gagging arounds,

86
00:04:44.190 --> 00:04:48.630
the shift away from teaching through violence was undoubtedly a boon to a young

87
00:04:48.830 --> 00:04:50.270
Quaker like Fred Sanger,

88
00:04:50.271 --> 00:04:54.510
who began to prefer the benefits of self-guided tinkering and experimentation

89
00:04:54.730 --> 00:04:58.030
Sanger reportedly enjoyed a good relationship with Fraser Highlands,

90
00:04:58.031 --> 00:04:59.790
the bronze and biology master,

91
00:04:59.970 --> 00:05:02.340
who would often take the out on adventures in nature.

92
00:05:02.480 --> 00:05:06.300
<v 0>He got along even better with the chemistry master Henry Jeffrey Ordish,</v>

93
00:05:06.460 --> 00:05:10.300
a man who was an accomplished photographer, electrician and motorcyclist.

94
00:05:10.600 --> 00:05:12.500
He ran the chemistry lab at Branston,

95
00:05:12.501 --> 00:05:16.580
which he had personally renovated and wired inside a portion of an old stable

96
00:05:16.780 --> 00:05:21.380
Sanger's quietly surging aptitude for the sciences propped up by Branson's E

97
00:05:21.570 --> 00:05:23.770
this on self-discipline and individual work.

98
00:05:23.990 --> 00:05:28.770
Put him on a trajectory towards success at the time borders set to take and

99
00:05:28.771 --> 00:05:31.770
pass their school certificate to graduate and qualify for university.

100
00:05:31.950 --> 00:05:36.130
And Sanger spent so much time working and studying alongside Highland and Ordish

101
00:05:36.280 --> 00:05:39.970
that he took and passed his certificate a year early as if that wasn't enough.

102
00:05:39.971 --> 00:05:41.890
He scored seven credits on his exam,

103
00:05:42.090 --> 00:05:46.400
which was at the time the highest score in the history of the school.

104
00:05:46.530 --> 00:05:49.680
While most of his peers were stressing over their own certificate.

105
00:05:49.780 --> 00:05:54.720
Sanger had a final year to tinker in the school laboratories and think about his

106
00:05:54.721 --> 00:05:56.920
future free of any pressure from exams.

107
00:05:57.260 --> 00:06:00.720
His father expected him to become a doctor and continue the sang a family

108
00:06:00.740 --> 00:06:04.960
legacy. And with high test marks and natural aptitude for the sciences,

109
00:06:05.110 --> 00:06:07.760
this was arguably the most logical choice.

110
00:06:07.761 --> 00:06:11.960
Frederick considered his options during his free year while continuing to

111
00:06:11.961 --> 00:06:16.200
conduct experiments with or in the stable lab in 1936,

112
00:06:16.201 --> 00:06:18.070
he appli and John's college at Cambridge.

113
00:06:18.250 --> 00:06:22.070
It was the natural choice for sang as it was the very same school attended by

114
00:06:22.071 --> 00:06:23.270
his father, his uncle,

115
00:06:23.410 --> 00:06:26.590
and his most influential teacher with his strong test scores.

116
00:06:26.591 --> 00:06:28.870
His acceptance was all bit of formality.

117
00:06:29.130 --> 00:06:32.710
His choice of studies on the other hands, while that was quite up in the air.

118
00:06:33.270 --> 00:06:36.950
Frederick arrived at the conclusion that his father's career while rewarding

119
00:06:37.310 --> 00:06:41.220
would not enable him the sort of intellectual freedom he had grown accustomed to

120
00:06:41.240 --> 00:06:43.900
in his formative years, his father was always running around,

121
00:06:43.901 --> 00:06:44.980
checking on patients,

122
00:06:44.981 --> 00:06:49.820
serving the community to him that sounded burdensome as he had throughout his

123
00:06:49.821 --> 00:06:52.340
childhood Frederick, the younger wanted to explore.

124
00:06:52.600 --> 00:06:53.780
So when he arrived at Cambridge,

125
00:06:53.800 --> 00:06:57.380
he placed himself in a natural sciences course track studying chemistry,

126
00:06:57.530 --> 00:06:58.970
physics, and maths.

127
00:06:59.070 --> 00:07:02.450
He found himself intrigued with the ideas of earnest Baldwin.

128
00:07:02.470 --> 00:07:06.410
One of his university teachers who proposed that solving certain mysteries in

129
00:07:06.411 --> 00:07:10.650
the world of chemistry might unlock new understanding of biological systems.

130
00:07:11.030 --> 00:07:13.570
As Sanger marched through his university education.

131
00:07:13.571 --> 00:07:18.480
He continued to gravitate toward the emerging field of biochemistry prior to

132
00:07:18.481 --> 00:07:22.720
the 20th century science and technology hadn't yet advanced far enough for

133
00:07:22.721 --> 00:07:27.480
mankind to really understand the extent of the relationship between biology and

134
00:07:27.481 --> 00:07:30.200
chemistry, but by the late 1930s,

135
00:07:30.260 --> 00:07:34.440
Sanger and his mentors were beginning to inch towards a complete understanding

136
00:07:34.740 --> 00:07:35.600
of the living world.

137
00:07:36.100 --> 00:07:40.630
By the time he completed his bachelor's degree in 9 39 though, biochemistry,

138
00:07:40.650 --> 00:07:44.630
wasn't the only thing inching closer towards Frederick Sanger.

139
00:07:44.631 --> 00:07:48.350
Europe had become embroiled in world war II and scientists and science

140
00:07:48.351 --> 00:07:52.110
departments everywhere were turning their focus away from lab experiments

141
00:07:52.260 --> 00:07:54.910
towards the growing access threat in Europe.

142
00:07:55.210 --> 00:07:59.460
Sanger was no stranger to the Nazis during his free Europe Brandston he had

143
00:07:59.461 --> 00:08:04.220
spent a few weeks at a partner boarding school called shul asylum in Southern

144
00:08:04.221 --> 00:08:05.980
Germany as part of an exchange program.

145
00:08:06.440 --> 00:08:10.420
He saw firsthand our German students were told to open their day with prayers.

146
00:08:10.530 --> 00:08:15.420
Then follow them with a reading from mine comp his religious sensibilities found

147
00:08:15.421 --> 00:08:20.290
this juxtaposition to be quite shocking as a great as though his on

148
00:08:20.291 --> 00:08:21.124
war was clear.

149
00:08:21.230 --> 00:08:24.970
He had affirmed his religious upbringing at university by becoming a member of

150
00:08:24.971 --> 00:08:29.130
the peace pledge union and associated with an anti-war group within Cambridge's

151
00:08:29.131 --> 00:08:33.850
family of scientists. So when Britain declared war on Germany in 1939, Sanger,

152
00:08:33.851 --> 00:08:38.130
wasn't just avoiding conflict. He was a true well established pacifist,

153
00:08:38.490 --> 00:08:42.240
and he had the receipts to prove it. After appearing before a military tribunal,

154
00:08:42.300 --> 00:08:44.520
he was granted conscientious, objector status.

155
00:08:44.910 --> 00:08:47.000
Even if Sanger wasn't going to war though,

156
00:08:47.340 --> 00:08:51.200
the war was gonna come to him after taking an extra biochemistry class at

157
00:08:51.201 --> 00:08:51.760
Cambridge,

158
00:08:51.760 --> 00:08:56.000
she was temporarily dispatched Winford hospital in 1940 to help staff a war

159
00:08:56.200 --> 00:08:57.960
hospital. As an orderly, after a few months,

160
00:08:57.980 --> 00:09:01.520
he was able to return to Cambridge where he began gearing up for his PhD,

161
00:09:02.300 --> 00:09:05.160
Sanger hunker down in his beloved biochemistry department,

162
00:09:05.161 --> 00:09:08.640
partnering up with Albert Newberger, his mentor together,

163
00:09:08.660 --> 00:09:12.200
the power undertook a study that focused on two fascinating subjects,

164
00:09:12.920 --> 00:09:16.270
bine metabolism and the hydrogen content of a potato.

165
00:09:16.650 --> 00:09:20.470
Now I realize that no one comes to biographics for our expert analysis of

166
00:09:20.471 --> 00:09:21.670
protein synthesis,

167
00:09:21.770 --> 00:09:26.310
but I'll try and do my very best to at least not in the direction of Sanger's

168
00:09:26.311 --> 00:09:30.350
thesis work Bly is one of nine essential amino acids,

169
00:09:30.351 --> 00:09:32.150
meaning it's required for human function,

170
00:09:32.410 --> 00:09:36.500
but it isn't efficiently produced in the human body in mass quantities.

171
00:09:36.640 --> 00:09:37.181
In other words,

172
00:09:37.181 --> 00:09:40.580
this means that it's something we have to incorporate into our diets.

173
00:09:40.760 --> 00:09:45.580
In the case of lysine, it's often consumed via meat, eggs, beans, or lenss,

174
00:09:45.600 --> 00:09:48.020
and the body uses it to synthesize key proteins.

175
00:09:48.620 --> 00:09:52.580
Sanger tried to unravel the nature of lyce metabolism meant a complex series of

176
00:09:52.581 --> 00:09:56.930
experiments centered around feeding it to wraps his were inconclusive.

177
00:09:57.070 --> 00:10:00.850
The scientific community didn't know enough about amino acids or proteins at

178
00:10:00.851 --> 00:10:01.350
that point.

179
00:10:01.350 --> 00:10:05.850
And it would be another 30 years before biochemists would unlock the lysine

180
00:10:05.880 --> 00:10:08.890
mystery, but Sanger nonetheless received credit for his thesis.

181
00:10:09.320 --> 00:10:13.010
This was called the metabolism of the amino acid lycine in the animal body.

182
00:10:13.150 --> 00:10:17.200
He defended his work to Charles Harrington and Albert Al in

183
00:10:17.600 --> 00:10:21.560
1943, receiving his PhD at the age of 26.

184
00:10:21.780 --> 00:10:23.360
At the same time he was crafting his thesis.

185
00:10:23.580 --> 00:10:27.800
He and Newberger began a separate experiment aimed at aiding the war efforts,

186
00:10:27.801 --> 00:10:31.960
and it examines variation in nitrogen levels for different types of domestic

187
00:10:32.080 --> 00:10:32.860
potatoes,

188
00:10:32.860 --> 00:10:36.950
Sanger eventually describes the potato experiment is one that was complet for

189
00:10:36.951 --> 00:10:38.030
more practical problems.

190
00:10:38.210 --> 00:10:42.430
The paper was published in biochemical journal in September, 1942.

191
00:10:42.690 --> 00:10:46.630
Now you might not be studying potatoes or in a lab at Cambridge,

192
00:10:46.810 --> 00:10:51.470
but you can still learn more about science through today's sponsor brilliance.

193
00:10:51.471 --> 00:10:55.230
Brilliant is a problem solving based website and app with a hands on approach.

194
00:10:55.260 --> 00:10:59.540
They've got over 60 Interac courses in math, science, and computer science.

195
00:10:59.980 --> 00:11:01.820
Now you've heard me talk about brilliant before,

196
00:11:01.821 --> 00:11:05.140
and whether you are a student looking to get ahead or a professional,

197
00:11:05.200 --> 00:11:09.620
Keenon building some skills, you should definitely check them out. Now,

198
00:11:09.621 --> 00:11:12.220
maybe you've wanted to learn about neural networks,

199
00:11:12.221 --> 00:11:16.420
essentially how computers can program themselves while brilliant have a course

200
00:11:16.600 --> 00:11:20.810
all about that. And it teaches you this through easy to access puzzles,

201
00:11:20.950 --> 00:11:25.090
and it does it in plain English. There's no reading a paragraph a dozen times,

202
00:11:25.190 --> 00:11:29.730
and then still being like what? I don't get it, not with brilliance.

203
00:11:29.950 --> 00:11:32.770
And that's just one example. There's loads of great stuff on their platform,

204
00:11:32.771 --> 00:11:34.330
including daily challenges,

205
00:11:34.331 --> 00:11:38.480
which are a great way to flex your gray matter every day.

206
00:11:38.830 --> 00:11:42.200
Look brilliant is a great compliment to watching videos like this one.

207
00:11:42.340 --> 00:11:47.080
And they'll really help you develop and master even complex technical subjects.

212
00:12:09.140 --> 00:12:11.920
As if singer didn't have enough going on in his life while he was earning

213
00:12:11.921 --> 00:12:14.990
degrees, writing thesises and supporting war hospitals.

214
00:12:15.210 --> 00:12:17.790
He was also falling in love. Sanger had met Joan Margaret,

215
00:12:18.270 --> 00:12:22.070
how through an anti-war group while pursuing his bachelors at Cambridge while he

216
00:12:22.071 --> 00:12:23.510
was tolling us in John's college.

217
00:12:23.660 --> 00:12:26.390
Joan was a Lester transplant studying economics.

218
00:12:26.500 --> 00:12:29.910
They grew close when Sanger lost both of his parents within a year of each

219
00:12:29.911 --> 00:12:31.190
other, halfway through undergrad,

220
00:12:31.220 --> 00:12:34.140
they were married soon after the war started it on December the 28th,

221
00:12:34.420 --> 00:12:37.380
1940 at St. Mary's church. Inside later,

222
00:12:37.520 --> 00:12:40.380
as he was preparing to defend his doctorate in 1943,

223
00:12:40.520 --> 00:12:44.540
he and Joan were also preparing to welcome their first child Robin into the

224
00:12:44.541 --> 00:12:47.740
world. 1943 is when it all changed for Sanger.

225
00:12:47.800 --> 00:12:49.420
It wasn't just the baby or the PhD.

226
00:12:49.840 --> 00:12:53.890
He also began to earn money as a professional scientist up until our point.

227
00:12:53.990 --> 00:12:57.490
Sanger enjoyed a comfortable life as a student, thanks to his family's wealth.

228
00:12:57.550 --> 00:13:02.410
And eventually the inheritance bequeathed from his parents. Finally in 1943,

229
00:13:02.430 --> 00:13:04.090
Sanger began drawing a real salary,

230
00:13:04.150 --> 00:13:07.250
thanks to the bait Memorial fellowship for medical research,

231
00:13:07.251 --> 00:13:11.810
which subsidized Sangas research into the 1950s with his PhD firmly enhanced

232
00:13:11.910 --> 00:13:16.320
Sanger turned arounds and began with the same man who'd signed off on his

233
00:13:16.321 --> 00:13:19.040
doctorate, newly minted, Cambridge biochemistry,

234
00:13:19.041 --> 00:13:23.960
professor AAL Al's research group at Cambridge was one of the

235
00:13:23.961 --> 00:13:26.600
foremost groups of experts on protein chemistry in the world.

236
00:13:26.660 --> 00:13:30.640
And they were determined to crack the mysteries behind how proteins did what

237
00:13:30.641 --> 00:13:32.520
they did. Not all scientists at the time,

238
00:13:32.550 --> 00:13:34.990
even believed proteins could be mapped, also studied,

239
00:13:34.991 --> 00:13:38.990
but chip believed that they could thus his team got to work.

240
00:13:39.250 --> 00:13:42.270
The team had already been studying insulin when Sanger joined the group.

241
00:13:42.330 --> 00:13:45.990
So he assigned himself the task of isolating and identifying the free amino

242
00:13:45.991 --> 00:13:47.990
groups of insulin through trial and error.

243
00:13:48.390 --> 00:13:52.390
Sanger developed a method using a chemical called dine nitro flu benne,

244
00:13:52.480 --> 00:13:57.380
which was a molecule specifically crafted AKI down into smaller chains of amino

245
00:13:57.630 --> 00:14:00.180
acids. Once he had broken it down into smaller pieces,

246
00:14:00.240 --> 00:14:03.540
he began using a brand new cutting edge technique called partition

247
00:14:03.560 --> 00:14:06.500
chromatography to break down the amino acid chains.

248
00:14:06.501 --> 00:14:11.060
Even further Sanger was eventually left with just two sets of TA amino groups,

249
00:14:11.740 --> 00:14:13.300
phenol, Laine, and glycine,

250
00:14:13.301 --> 00:14:18.090
which suggested to our brilliant S that insulin is the product of two

251
00:14:18.290 --> 00:14:22.890
separate amino acids. Okay. Now, unless you're an actual biochemist,

252
00:14:22.891 --> 00:14:27.090
there's a chance that you don't have the first idea of what any of that meant,

253
00:14:27.310 --> 00:14:28.143
and that's okay.

254
00:14:28.190 --> 00:14:31.530
I'm sure your sharpest attack in whatever it is you do for a living.

255
00:14:31.930 --> 00:14:35.170
All you really need to know about our B Frederick here is that with careful

256
00:14:35.171 --> 00:14:37.440
experimentation over the course of a decade,

257
00:14:37.660 --> 00:14:41.720
he went farther in his understanding of basic protein structure than any human

258
00:14:41.790 --> 00:14:42.680
ever had before.

259
00:14:42.740 --> 00:14:47.400
And he accomplished it all simply by doing what he did best standing at his work

260
00:14:47.401 --> 00:14:51.120
bench tinkering with science by the time Sanger had established,

261
00:14:51.260 --> 00:14:55.520
he knew for sure that insulin had two distinct unchanging peptide chains.

262
00:14:55.780 --> 00:14:58.440
He had already shocked the scientific world at the time,

263
00:14:58.441 --> 00:15:00.080
which was only 75 years ago.

264
00:15:00.081 --> 00:15:03.840
The scientific community had yet to prove that proteins were made up of specific

265
00:15:04.160 --> 00:15:08.720
sequences and not randomized or ever changing amino groups. By the 1950s,

266
00:15:09.000 --> 00:15:10.710
he had attracted other scientists to album,

267
00:15:10.760 --> 00:15:14.150
completely mapped the entire insulin protein. Again,

268
00:15:14.151 --> 00:15:18.670
saying I recognized the usefulness of new applications like paper chromatography

269
00:15:18.671 --> 00:15:23.110
and acid hydrolysis, and used these modern allowances to his advantage.

270
00:15:23.450 --> 00:15:27.710
He partnered with Australian biochemist, EOP Thompson, a fully ma insulin,

271
00:15:28.110 --> 00:15:32.580
a chain that ends in lysing. Similarly partnered with Austrian hands,

272
00:15:33.060 --> 00:15:35.340
topi Toma, the Bline chain.

273
00:15:35.490 --> 00:15:38.260
This was the first time anyone had ever mapped a full protein,

274
00:15:38.550 --> 00:15:43.380
completely redefining modern science's vision of what biochemists could uncover.

275
00:15:43.860 --> 00:15:48.180
<v 4>I mean, I didn't have any sort of grand ideas like sitting down and saying,</v>

276
00:15:48.320 --> 00:15:52.330
I'm going to sequence a whole protein or anything like that. I mean,

277
00:15:52.331 --> 00:15:53.120
that makes a.

278
00:15:53.120 --> 00:15:54.970
<v 0>Good story. By 1958,</v>

279
00:15:55.170 --> 00:15:58.930
Frederick sang as world had evolved quite a bit in the 15 years since his PhD,

280
00:15:59.690 --> 00:16:02.930
Joan had given birth again to a son named Peter in 1946,

281
00:16:03.110 --> 00:16:07.090
the medical research counselor had offered him a paid research position in 1951,

282
00:16:07.490 --> 00:16:08.850
arch Martin and Richard sin.

283
00:16:08.950 --> 00:16:13.920
The inventors of partition chromatography had won the 1952 Nobel prize chemistry

284
00:16:14.160 --> 00:16:15.640
D nitro Fluro benne.

285
00:16:15.780 --> 00:16:19.880
The original chemical that Frederick used to break up insulin had been

286
00:16:20.440 --> 00:16:23.520
christened Sanger's Regent. Then finally in 1958,

287
00:16:23.580 --> 00:16:27.240
the Royal Swedish academy of sciences made official what everyone in the

288
00:16:27.241 --> 00:16:31.040
community seemed to already know for revealing the full sequence of a protein

289
00:16:31.420 --> 00:16:35.590
and revolutionizing the human knowledge of proteins and their peptide chains.

290
00:16:35.591 --> 00:16:40.590
Frederick Sanger was awarded the Nobel prize for chemistry Sanger wasn't done

291
00:16:40.591 --> 00:16:45.310
yet though, if anything, his first Nobel validated his exploratory approach.

292
00:16:45.610 --> 00:16:50.310
Sanger wrote to his colleagues years later saying that the 1958 prize had an

293
00:16:50.311 --> 00:16:53.700
important and stimulating effect on my Quin career.

294
00:16:53.980 --> 00:16:57.980
I had remained in Cambridge concentrating only on basic research and dev

295
00:16:57.981 --> 00:17:01.660
avoiding as far as possible teaching or administrative responsibilities.

296
00:17:02.010 --> 00:17:05.900
This recognition of my work gave me renewed confidence and enthusiasm to

297
00:17:06.340 --> 00:17:08.780
continue in this way of life, which I enjoyed

298
00:17:15.290 --> 00:17:18.850
Sanger's insulin revelation should send quakes through the adolescent

299
00:17:18.890 --> 00:17:22.650
biochemistry fields, but ask any Brit about the revolution of the 1960s.

300
00:17:22.651 --> 00:17:26.730
And they'll probably tell you everything you wanted to know about John Lennon or

301
00:17:26.890 --> 00:17:28.370
Roger adultery, but quietly,

302
00:17:28.371 --> 00:17:31.330
while the kinks were ripping fresh chords in north London,

303
00:17:31.510 --> 00:17:35.760
the molecular revolution was well under inside the halls of Cambridge

304
00:17:35.761 --> 00:17:38.160
laboratories. Two years after this final child,

305
00:17:38.480 --> 00:17:42.320
Sally was born in 1960 Sanger moved into the medical research council,

306
00:17:42.720 --> 00:17:43.920
SW you Cambridge facility.

307
00:17:44.180 --> 00:17:48.720
The laboratory of molecular biology Sanger for his part was the head of the

308
00:17:48.721 --> 00:17:49.554
protein division,

309
00:17:49.620 --> 00:17:53.880
but she was hardly the only big name in the building just a few years before

310
00:17:54.160 --> 00:17:55.760
cream formed in 1966,

311
00:17:55.790 --> 00:18:00.160
Cambridge was putting together a super group of their very own Sanger

312
00:18:00.960 --> 00:18:02.080
ACLU. Max Pertz,

313
00:18:02.150 --> 00:18:06.760
John Kendra and Francis Crick all began working out of the L M B

314
00:18:07.080 --> 00:18:11.190
building and they had an unreal opening salvo parrot,

315
00:18:11.430 --> 00:18:16.430
and Kendra won the 1962 Nobel prize for chemistry by expanding on Sangs

316
00:18:16.431 --> 00:18:16.990
earlier work,

317
00:18:16.990 --> 00:18:21.510
studying the structures of Glo proteins quick one and even more high profile

318
00:18:21.600 --> 00:18:24.470
Nobel in 1962 was he and the American partner,

319
00:18:24.520 --> 00:18:29.500
James Watson uncovered the double heli structure of DNA winning the Nobel prize

320
00:18:29.560 --> 00:18:34.340
for physiology and medicine. The lab halls in the LMB were absolutely booming,

321
00:18:34.341 --> 00:18:38.460
cranking out new revelations about the nature of life faster than the scientific

322
00:18:38.461 --> 00:18:41.980
community could process them after Watson and Creek's DNA projection,

323
00:18:42.050 --> 00:18:46.780
much of the team's focus moved from amino acids and proteins, tole acids,

324
00:18:46.800 --> 00:18:50.210
and genetic material with all the discovery going on around him.

325
00:18:50.350 --> 00:18:54.890
Sanger began to feel his interests pulling in a new direction just as he had

326
00:18:54.891 --> 00:18:58.010
spent hours tinkering arounds, unraveling the secrets of proteins.

327
00:18:58.230 --> 00:19:01.890
He now wanted to investigate the nature of nucleic acids.

328
00:19:02.150 --> 00:19:05.770
Sanger viewed an investigation into genetics as the natural evolution of his

329
00:19:05.771 --> 00:19:07.290
investigation into proteins.

330
00:19:07.470 --> 00:19:11.640
He spent much of the 1960s solely quiting messenger RNA,

331
00:19:11.641 --> 00:19:15.560
which in case you forgotten your health sciences from primary school is sort of

332
00:19:15.561 --> 00:19:20.200
like DNA's little brother that helps synthesize new proteins in the 1960s

333
00:19:20.220 --> 00:19:22.480
Sanger and his peers didn't really know that though,

334
00:19:22.481 --> 00:19:27.320
which was why there was such a push to study nucleic acids in the first place by

335
00:19:27.321 --> 00:19:28.440
the early 1970s,

336
00:19:28.441 --> 00:19:32.510
several biochemists from around the world used in vitro protein synthesis to

337
00:19:32.511 --> 00:19:33.310
reverse engineer.

338
00:19:33.310 --> 00:19:37.190
How proteins developed on nucleotides and Sangs completed sequences helped

339
00:19:37.191 --> 00:19:40.990
confirm the first round of RNA hypotheses with RNA. Now,

340
00:19:40.991 --> 00:19:42.430
at least partially unlocked,

341
00:19:42.450 --> 00:19:46.990
Sanger wanted to move on to studying the white whale of the late 20th century

342
00:19:47.710 --> 00:19:49.390
genomics mapping and DNA.

343
00:19:49.860 --> 00:19:53.580
Despite three decades saying are pioneering these signs of organic sequencing.

344
00:19:53.800 --> 00:19:57.300
No one had really attempted to map human DNA and there was a very good reason

345
00:19:57.320 --> 00:20:00.940
for this DNA strands, even for non-humans are massive.

346
00:20:01.190 --> 00:20:03.820
We're talking about thousands of nucleotides for bacteria,

347
00:20:04.220 --> 00:20:07.860
millions for most complex organisms and billions for primates.

348
00:20:08.120 --> 00:20:10.980
So before we could even think about sequencing, anything,

349
00:20:11.380 --> 00:20:15.730
Frederick Sanger had to do what he did best play arounds in his lab and invent

350
00:20:15.731 --> 00:20:19.370
some brands. New scientific methodology. By 1975,

351
00:20:19.590 --> 00:20:21.170
Sanger had the beginnings of a plan.

352
00:20:21.270 --> 00:20:26.010
He began using a manipulated nuclear tide called a Didy nuclear tide to chop

353
00:20:26.011 --> 00:20:30.370
down DNA strands into pieces that were a few hundred nuclear tides long rather

354
00:20:30.371 --> 00:20:31.530
than tens of thousands,

355
00:20:31.670 --> 00:20:35.600
but in Yorky had a similar chemical structure to a regular nuclear tide,

356
00:20:35.660 --> 00:20:39.280
but with one key difference, it could peel chains off,

357
00:20:39.290 --> 00:20:41.560
separating them from the rest of the double helix.

358
00:20:41.740 --> 00:20:43.640
If sang repeated the process enough times,

359
00:20:43.740 --> 00:20:46.280
he could sequence an entire organism's DNA.

360
00:20:46.980 --> 00:20:51.720
And that was exactly what he did slowly but surely he completed the mapping out

361
00:20:51.740 --> 00:20:54.840
of 5,375 nuclear tides of,

362
00:20:55.040 --> 00:20:59.560
of bacteria phage fi X 1 74 in 1977.

363
00:20:59.660 --> 00:21:02.760
It was the first DNA genome to ever be sequenced. Once again,

364
00:21:03.080 --> 00:21:07.950
sang had embarked on a 15 year scientific arty with Watson and Creek's

365
00:21:07.951 --> 00:21:10.350
double helix discovery back in 1962,

366
00:21:10.580 --> 00:21:15.070
that culminated in a seminal moment in human scientific discovery.

367
00:21:15.900 --> 00:21:19.470
Sies 1 74 genome had virtually no practical application,

368
00:21:19.490 --> 00:21:22.990
but it did represent a gateway to the idea that human genetics could

369
00:21:23.020 --> 00:21:27.220
realistically be sequenced and studied the first team through the gateway egg

370
00:21:27.280 --> 00:21:28.180
unsurprisingly.

371
00:21:28.181 --> 00:21:32.220
It was Sangs Cambridge gang after successfully tackling a bacterial genome.

372
00:21:32.330 --> 00:21:37.060
They moved on to map the 16,000 nuclear tides in human mitochondrial DNA

373
00:21:37.420 --> 00:21:40.980
and the 48,000 nuclear tides in bacteria, phage Lambda,

374
00:21:40.981 --> 00:21:44.260
finishing those projects over the next few years by 1980,

375
00:21:44.261 --> 00:21:47.890
the raw Swedish academy of sciences was ready to place Sanger's name an

376
00:21:48.170 --> 00:21:52.370
incredibly rare app for massive contributions to the booming scientific field of

377
00:21:52.371 --> 00:21:53.330
DNA sequencing.

378
00:21:53.510 --> 00:21:57.890
The 1980 Nobel prize for chemistry was awarded to Sanger and his sequencing

379
00:21:57.891 --> 00:22:01.090
partner, Walter Gilbert for their work with nuclear tide basis.

380
00:22:01.730 --> 00:22:02.610
American biochemist,

381
00:22:03.130 --> 00:22:06.370
Paul Berg received credit on the award as well for his parallel work on nuclear

382
00:22:06.420 --> 00:22:08.400
tides and recom D eight.

383
00:22:08.590 --> 00:22:13.360
This was an unprecedented move from the Nobel committee as only four individuals

384
00:22:13.460 --> 00:22:17.040
had ever won multiple Nobels Marie Keri for physics and chemistry.

385
00:22:17.190 --> 00:22:21.520
John Bardine twice for physics and liners polling for chemistry and peace

386
00:22:22.360 --> 00:22:26.920
Sanger became the fourth and final member of the exclusive multiple Nobel club.

387
00:22:27.070 --> 00:22:31.750
It's a fitting honor for a who approached his research with a quite relentless

388
00:22:31.751 --> 00:22:34.990
dignity during his 1980 Nobel speech Sanger explained,

389
00:22:35.430 --> 00:22:39.750
I believe that we have been doing this not primarily to achieve riches or even

390
00:22:39.950 --> 00:22:40.250
honor,

391
00:22:40.250 --> 00:22:44.990
but rather because we were interested in the work enjoyed doing it and felt very

392
00:22:45.270 --> 00:22:49.580
strongly that it was worthwhile. It was a classic line from a classic scientist.

393
00:22:49.680 --> 00:22:51.580
One who knew even from an early age,

394
00:22:51.610 --> 00:22:55.420
that playing arounds at a lab bench was its own reward.

395
00:23:01.690 --> 00:23:06.100
Fred Sanger retired in 1983, just three years after his second Nobel prize.

396
00:23:06.390 --> 00:23:10.730
40 years of revolutionary lab work at bin enough for him. He wanted to go home,

397
00:23:11.170 --> 00:23:14.250
spend time with his wife and grandchildren and work in his garden.

398
00:23:15.050 --> 00:23:17.450
Sang remained disarmingly humble about his career,

399
00:23:17.460 --> 00:23:21.930
which by all accounts was filled with revolutionary discoveries and near

400
00:23:22.020 --> 00:23:24.890
superhuman levels of persistence beyond his two Nobels.

401
00:23:24.891 --> 00:23:29.410
He was elected a member of the Royal society in 1954 and order of the companions

402
00:23:29.411 --> 00:23:30.920
of honor, in 1981,

403
00:23:31.020 --> 00:23:34.320
he was named a commander of the order of the British EMPA awarded the Coley

404
00:23:34.520 --> 00:23:37.400
medal and the order of merit. Oh, and in 1993,

405
00:23:37.401 --> 00:23:41.160
when the British medical research center moved to establish a genome research

406
00:23:41.161 --> 00:23:43.760
center, they named it, the Sanger Institute,

407
00:23:44.140 --> 00:23:48.680
all this from a man who fondly referred to his career as just a chap

408
00:23:48.830 --> 00:23:53.200
messing about in a lab. Sanger did enjoy working on projects,

409
00:23:53.201 --> 00:23:57.040
which is partially why he began looking forward to his retirement so much.

410
00:23:57.100 --> 00:23:59.720
He wanted to swap his beakers for a boat.

411
00:24:00.180 --> 00:24:03.760
And so he did quietly spending the final three decades of his life,

412
00:24:03.761 --> 00:24:06.870
enjoying to I with his family growing plants in his garden.

413
00:24:07.170 --> 00:24:10.830
And by his own words, messing about in boats,

414
00:24:11.470 --> 00:24:12.990
tan lived along and full life.

415
00:24:13.510 --> 00:24:16.950
Enjoy plenty of time with his grandchildren and eventually seeing his work with

416
00:24:16.970 --> 00:24:21.310
DNA sequencing fully realized 20 years after his retirement in 2003,

417
00:24:21.790 --> 00:24:25.380
an extraordinary international team of scientists completed their work on the

418
00:24:25.381 --> 00:24:25.840
human genome.

419
00:24:25.840 --> 00:24:29.940
Having completely mapped out every nuclide responsible for human genetics.

420
00:24:30.320 --> 00:24:33.460
And it had all started decades earlier with Sanger,

421
00:24:33.740 --> 00:24:38.340
a Cambridge laboratory and an insatiable curiosity for knowledge Sanger's wife,

422
00:24:38.370 --> 00:24:42.980
Joan died in 2012 and Sanger passed away the following year on November,

423
00:24:43.000 --> 00:24:47.650
the 19th, 2013, he was 95. The world's mourned,

424
00:24:47.690 --> 00:24:49.690
a Titan of 20th century science.

425
00:24:49.950 --> 00:24:53.610
The New York times labeled him a genetic pioneer while scientific American

426
00:24:53.750 --> 00:24:56.090
crowns. Him, the father of DNA sequencing.

427
00:24:56.320 --> 00:25:00.370
It's an appropriate title for a man whose influence reverberates throughout the

428
00:25:00.371 --> 00:25:04.770
history of science Sangs work with proteins ignited revolution. So vast,

429
00:25:05.110 --> 00:25:09.560
we still haven't fully completed the results nearly 75 years down the road,

430
00:25:10.040 --> 00:25:14.720
his 1977 DNA paper run the Didy sequencing method also called the

431
00:25:14.721 --> 00:25:18.400
Sanger method has been formally cited by other scientific publications.

432
00:25:18.430 --> 00:25:20.560
More than 73,000 times.

433
00:25:20.820 --> 00:25:24.360
The Cambridge laboratory for molecular biology has continued to churn out Nobel

434
00:25:24.361 --> 00:25:28.510
laureates. The British press refers to it as the Nobel factory,

435
00:25:29.050 --> 00:25:32.430
but even there, no one has equaled Frederick Sanger's achievements.

436
00:25:32.690 --> 00:25:36.350
His astounding life of Peerless achievements leaves us all with a critical

437
00:25:36.710 --> 00:25:38.430
question of self-examination.

438
00:25:38.730 --> 00:25:43.070
If we all sat down with a goal in mind and messed about until we got it right,

439
00:25:43.660 --> 00:25:46.910
what could we accomplish? So I really hope you found that video. Interesting.
