00:00:00.090 --> 00:00:03.490
<v 0>When it comes to being a Roman emperor, if you want to be remembered,</v>

2
00:00:03.540 --> 00:00:06.120
there seem to be two sure-fire ways of doing it.

3
00:00:06.300 --> 00:00:11.010
One is to be a capable ruler and day strong military leader men like all Gustus

4
00:00:11.220 --> 00:00:13.440
Trajan and Vespasian come to mind.

5
00:00:13.530 --> 00:00:16.740
The other is to go completely mad with power like Caligula,

6
00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:21.560
a narrow for better or worse history does seem to love a blood thirsty

7
00:00:21.590 --> 00:00:24.120
deranged lunatic. Marcus Aurelius,

8
00:00:24.121 --> 00:00:28.350
an emperor who we've already covered was firmly placed in the first camp.

9
00:00:28.620 --> 00:00:29.130
Therefore,

10
00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:33.870
it wasn't unusual to expect his son communists to follow in his footsteps,

11
00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:35.790
but he did it. Nope. In fact,

12
00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:39.030
commerce was about as far removed from his father's legacy.

13
00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:40.800
As one would think possible.

14
00:00:53.420 --> 00:00:57.050
Columbus was born on August the 31st 161,

15
00:00:57.051 --> 00:01:01.520
a D in VM, the modern day city of LA Movio,

16
00:01:01.521 --> 00:01:04.880
about 20 miles Southeast of Rome. He was the son of Roman emperor,

17
00:01:04.881 --> 00:01:07.730
Marcus Aurelius, and his wife Faustina. The young guy,

18
00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:12.020
comatose was born in the purple meaning that he was born during the reign of his

19
00:01:12.021 --> 00:01:14.540
father. He was the 17th Roman emperor,

20
00:01:14.570 --> 00:01:17.090
but the first to be born under these conditions,

21
00:01:17.180 --> 00:01:21.980
as common as himself said in a speech, I never knew the touch of common cloth.

22
00:01:22.130 --> 00:01:26.150
The pebble received me as soon as I came forth into the world and the sun shone

23
00:01:26.151 --> 00:01:31.070
down upon me, man, and emperor. At the same moment, you might see things,

24
00:01:31.071 --> 00:01:32.720
this set him up for great things,

25
00:01:32.721 --> 00:01:37.490
but historian Cassius DEO described kilometers as being as guileless as any

26
00:01:37.491 --> 00:01:41.750
man that ever lived characterizing him by cowardice ignorance and great

27
00:01:41.751 --> 00:01:44.270
simplicity in 166,

28
00:01:44.271 --> 00:01:47.150
the five-year-old competence was named Caesar by his father,

29
00:01:47.151 --> 00:01:51.620
which by that point was a dynastic title meant to designate him as the out of

30
00:01:51.621 --> 00:01:52.454
the throne.

31
00:01:52.460 --> 00:01:56.300
Microsoft radius also appointed another one of his sons and he has verus as

32
00:01:56.301 --> 00:01:57.500
Caesar showing this,

33
00:01:57.501 --> 00:02:01.730
he intended for the two brothers to rule jointly as he did with his own sibling

34
00:02:01.760 --> 00:02:06.170
Lucius versus however, any us verus died in 169 a D.

35
00:02:06.171 --> 00:02:07.100
And for whatever reason,

36
00:02:07.101 --> 00:02:10.760
his father decided against the pointing and other Caesar and kept comedies as a

37
00:02:11.060 --> 00:02:12.530
sole lap in doing so.

38
00:02:12.560 --> 00:02:16.700
He broke with the tradition established by the post five room and rulers or the

39
00:02:16.701 --> 00:02:21.470
five good emperors as they were known where each one selected his successor

40
00:02:21.710 --> 00:02:23.210
and adopted him. Instead,

41
00:02:23.211 --> 00:02:27.410
Microsoft radios hopes that he could mold his own flesh and blood into becoming

42
00:02:27.530 --> 00:02:28.400
a great ruler.

43
00:02:28.460 --> 00:02:31.460
He provided commiters with the best education that money could buy,

44
00:02:31.580 --> 00:02:35.360
paying large fees for scholars to come live in Rome and to tutor his son.

45
00:02:35.570 --> 00:02:38.600
He took commiters alongside him during military campaigns,

46
00:02:38.601 --> 00:02:39.530
even when he was young,

47
00:02:39.531 --> 00:02:43.970
so that he may learn how to command an army and 177 Ady Marcus

48
00:02:43.971 --> 00:02:48.290
Aurelius granted the title of all Gustus to comedies thus equaling his own

49
00:02:48.291 --> 00:02:51.110
status and making his son ruler even.

50
00:02:51.111 --> 00:02:55.580
So he realized that the new emperor were still impatient and immature.

51
00:02:55.790 --> 00:02:56.990
In the last years of his life,

52
00:02:57.020 --> 00:03:01.480
Marcus Aurelius appointed many of his most generals and companions to serve as

53
00:03:01.481 --> 00:03:06.250
advisors to comedies Ben in 180 AED while engaged in the macro manic Wars,

54
00:03:06.430 --> 00:03:10.330
he died leaving his son as the new sole emperor of Rome.

55
00:03:17.190 --> 00:03:20.310
Commodus was 18 years old. When he took over the throne in the middle of a war,

56
00:03:20.400 --> 00:03:21.780
he could have been a good ruler.

57
00:03:21.990 --> 00:03:25.740
If he would have been inclined to listen to the many guardians that his father

58
00:03:25.741 --> 00:03:27.360
had provided for him. Instead,

59
00:03:27.570 --> 00:03:31.380
it did not take long for him to start ignoring them completely to pursue his own

60
00:03:31.381 --> 00:03:35.700
whims or even worse. The ideas of his sycophantic entourage.

61
00:03:35.760 --> 00:03:39.510
It was these people that Cassius DEO blames for the initial corruption of

62
00:03:40.110 --> 00:03:41.310
calamitous. He called the young emperor,

63
00:03:41.490 --> 00:03:44.100
the slave of his companions in Greek historian.

64
00:03:44.760 --> 00:03:48.900
Herodians agreed that these courtiers took advantage of the naive ruler and

65
00:03:48.901 --> 00:03:52.800
filled his head with tales of pleasures and delights awaiting. And back in Rome,

66
00:03:53.580 --> 00:03:56.550
communists soon made up his mind. He wanted the water ends,

67
00:03:56.640 --> 00:03:59.640
not because of the bloodshed or because it was best for Rome,

68
00:03:59.641 --> 00:04:04.050
but because he wanted to return to his palace and start living the lavish life

69
00:04:04.200 --> 00:04:06.240
of an emperor. At this point in the war,

70
00:04:06.300 --> 00:04:08.940
Rome had the clever advantage by pressing on.

71
00:04:08.941 --> 00:04:12.930
They could have neutralized enemies who had been causing problems for 15 years

72
00:04:13.050 --> 00:04:15.120
against the advice of all of his generals.

73
00:04:15.270 --> 00:04:18.240
Communists told them to negotiate peace as soon as possible.

74
00:04:18.330 --> 00:04:22.800
And so the macrobiotic Wars ended in 180 with terms favorable to Rome,

75
00:04:22.801 --> 00:04:23.251
of course,

76
00:04:23.251 --> 00:04:27.480
but still mild compared to what they could have been back in the capital of the

77
00:04:27.481 --> 00:04:30.900
empire does through a celebration in his honor, gold,

78
00:04:30.960 --> 00:04:35.580
a triumph with games and music and feasts and handouts to the Roman populace to

79
00:04:35.790 --> 00:04:37.380
win over the people. In fact,

80
00:04:37.740 --> 00:04:40.710
comatose managed to retain his popularity with the common man throughout most of

81
00:04:40.711 --> 00:04:42.240
his 12 years. So low rain,

82
00:04:42.480 --> 00:04:46.410
mainly because he was often willing to open the raw coffers and spend money on

83
00:04:46.411 --> 00:04:47.970
lavish spectacles, even.

84
00:04:47.971 --> 00:04:52.740
So it did not take long before those around him started to plot against the

85
00:04:52.741 --> 00:04:57.390
emperor in 182 Ady comma discerns, the IRA of his older sister, Lou cellar,

86
00:04:57.630 --> 00:04:59.370
who was married to Claudius Palm.

87
00:04:59.370 --> 00:05:03.000
Pena's one of the most distinguished generals on DeMarcus Orelia.

88
00:05:03.001 --> 00:05:06.510
So now mostly served as an ignored advisor to the new emperor.

89
00:05:06.630 --> 00:05:10.500
Before this Lucinda had also been married to Lucius verus Marcus Aurelius,

90
00:05:10.650 --> 00:05:11.760
his brother and co Ambra,

91
00:05:12.060 --> 00:05:16.170
Def all blue silver had been granted the title of all gusta and all the Imperial

92
00:05:16.200 --> 00:05:18.670
honors that came with it. When communists became member,

93
00:05:18.690 --> 00:05:20.920
though he married broody or spina,

94
00:05:21.090 --> 00:05:24.720
and all of a sudden all of the privileges of being Rome's highest ranking woman

95
00:05:24.900 --> 00:05:28.980
were afforded to her and Lucila considered this a great insult.

96
00:05:29.100 --> 00:05:30.080
She knew there's a husband,

97
00:05:30.270 --> 00:05:33.510
Paul Benitez would not take part in a plot to assassinate comedies.

98
00:05:33.511 --> 00:05:37.950
So instead she turned to a young nobleman named Marcus or medius

99
00:05:37.980 --> 00:05:41.850
quadratus, and the honest, who was also rumored to be her lover,

100
00:05:41.940 --> 00:05:44.880
quadratus enlisted the help of a Senator named Quintin.

101
00:05:45.360 --> 00:05:49.410
Deanna Sue agreed to attack the emperor in the entrance of an amphitheater under

102
00:05:49.411 --> 00:05:52.380
the shroud of darkness. According to historian her audience,

103
00:05:53.310 --> 00:05:55.050
[inaudible] had the opportunity to slay commerce,

104
00:05:55.060 --> 00:05:58.400
but made the mistake of delivering a little speech beforehand,

105
00:05:58.520 --> 00:06:00.620
telling him that the Senate wants to him debt.

106
00:06:00.680 --> 00:06:02.390
The time he wasted was enough of the emperor,

107
00:06:02.510 --> 00:06:06.800
his bodyguards to pounce on him and kill that would be assassin was the first

108
00:06:06.801 --> 00:06:11.420
plot on commerce as life afterwards came an investigation and everyone suspected

109
00:06:11.421 --> 00:06:13.430
of taking pots in the plot was put to death.

110
00:06:13.460 --> 00:06:17.150
This included quadratus and even the emperor sister Lucila,

111
00:06:17.151 --> 00:06:19.670
but curiously enough, Palm Pena's was sped.

112
00:06:19.760 --> 00:06:23.090
Maybe commiters genuinely believed that the general played no part in the

113
00:06:23.091 --> 00:06:23.630
matter,

114
00:06:23.630 --> 00:06:27.650
or maybe he still felt some kind of deference for one of his father's closest

115
00:06:27.651 --> 00:06:28.310
allies,

116
00:06:28.310 --> 00:06:32.180
either way Claudia Pena's was allowed to quietly retire away from Romans,

117
00:06:32.390 --> 00:06:36.560
go and live on an estate in the country, citing his old age as an excuse.

118
00:06:36.740 --> 00:06:41.630
Cassius DEO gave an interesting accounts of a man named [inaudible],

119
00:06:41.750 --> 00:06:45.170
who managed to fake his death and evade. The wrath of calamitous.

120
00:06:45.230 --> 00:06:48.770
This family had been implicated in the assassination plot and his father and

121
00:06:48.771 --> 00:06:52.300
uncle had already been executed. When he heard that he too had been condemned.

122
00:06:52.820 --> 00:06:56.330
Jeff Colombianas took a hat, killed it and drank its blood to this,

123
00:06:56.540 --> 00:06:58.700
kept him in his mouth. Instead of swallowing,

124
00:06:58.820 --> 00:07:02.090
he then wrote his hauls and fell on purpose, vomiting up the blood.

125
00:07:02.150 --> 00:07:05.600
Those around him thought that he had been gravely injured and took him to his

126
00:07:05.601 --> 00:07:07.550
bed to believing that he was at death, his door,

127
00:07:07.610 --> 00:07:11.330
nobody questioned when new spreads that he had died. But by that point,

128
00:07:11.331 --> 00:07:13.490
he had already disappeared instructing his sevens.

129
00:07:13.491 --> 00:07:17.570
Do you place a Ram's body in his coffin and Burnett comatose eventually learned

130
00:07:17.571 --> 00:07:20.120
of the deception and scoured the embar, looking for the man,

131
00:07:20.121 --> 00:07:23.840
but it was allegedly never found. And his ultimate fate remains a mystery.

132
00:07:29.920 --> 00:07:30.490
<v 2>[Inaudible].</v>

133
00:07:30.490 --> 00:07:33.340
<v 0>On his life, had a major impact on comedies his behavior.</v>

134
00:07:33.490 --> 00:07:35.650
He took the words of Quinton's Yannis to heart.

135
00:07:35.651 --> 00:07:37.330
And from then on considered the Senate,

136
00:07:37.331 --> 00:07:41.770
his enemy throughout his whole rain calmness looked for new ways of curtailing

137
00:07:41.771 --> 00:07:44.380
the power of senators and other wealthy officials,

138
00:07:44.381 --> 00:07:48.550
including having the executed and their property confiscated after all the money

139
00:07:48.551 --> 00:07:51.340
that he spends on his lavish lifestyle had to come from some wet.

140
00:07:51.580 --> 00:07:54.130
Whenever a power vacuum is created someone new,

141
00:07:54.160 --> 00:07:57.190
always steps up to try and fill that void. As the sentence is lost,

142
00:07:57.340 --> 00:08:00.730
their authority and influence other people from calmness is in a circle Rose up

143
00:08:00.760 --> 00:08:03.910
to improve their station. One of these was tikka Diaz, parentless.

144
00:08:03.911 --> 00:08:06.940
So he was elevated to the position of Praetorian prefect.

145
00:08:06.941 --> 00:08:11.170
At the beginning of calmness, his rain and steadily gains more power for a time.

146
00:08:11.171 --> 00:08:13.600
He was even considered the de facto ruler of Rome.

147
00:08:13.690 --> 00:08:17.830
He was more than happy to let the embroidering gauge in his licentious wins and

148
00:08:18.340 --> 00:08:21.490
games. Well, Perez took on more administrative duties.

149
00:08:21.550 --> 00:08:23.410
He also turns the emperor against anyone.

150
00:08:23.411 --> 00:08:27.010
He perceived to be a threat to his authority by convincing comatose that they

151
00:08:27.011 --> 00:08:28.120
were plotting against him.

152
00:08:28.180 --> 00:08:30.730
This is how he got rid of the other Praetorian prefects.

153
00:08:33.610 --> 00:08:36.610
[inaudible] implicated him in a plot to assassinate the emperor. Also,

154
00:08:36.611 --> 00:08:37.720
according to her audien,

155
00:08:37.900 --> 00:08:42.220
Puranas targeted the wealthiest senators sands by confiscating their properties

156
00:08:42.400 --> 00:08:44.740
made himself the richest man of his time.

157
00:08:44.800 --> 00:08:47.380
Understandably Purina's end himself a lot of enemies.

158
00:08:47.381 --> 00:08:51.280
Some because of his actions and other zoo was simply envious of his privileged

159
00:08:51.281 --> 00:08:52.930
position. But as it turns out,

160
00:08:52.931 --> 00:08:55.560
he could not convince communists to have them all executed.

161
00:08:55.860 --> 00:08:58.860
As there were other people apart from him who were in the emperor,

162
00:08:58.861 --> 00:09:02.370
his good graces, one of them was Marcus Aurelius clans,

163
00:09:02.440 --> 00:09:05.040
a Friedman born in [inaudible] region,

164
00:09:05.041 --> 00:09:08.550
which is today part of Turkey clans who had also risen through the ranks by

165
00:09:08.551 --> 00:09:10.650
being a part of [inaudible] is in a circle.

166
00:09:11.310 --> 00:09:14.820
Cassius Dio said that he possessed the greatest influence after parentless,

167
00:09:14.880 --> 00:09:18.480
which is perhaps more impressive as clans a had originally been brought to Rome

168
00:09:18.481 --> 00:09:22.770
as a slave to serve as a pack carrier. However, by 182 80,

169
00:09:22.771 --> 00:09:25.140
he was working in saline, the Imperial household,

170
00:09:25.290 --> 00:09:28.170
after the assassination plot clans or killed Commodores,

171
00:09:28.290 --> 00:09:32.170
his chamberlains say a terrorist who allegedly was part of the conspiracy and

172
00:09:32.550 --> 00:09:35.580
deceived his position, thus entering into the, his close confidence

173
00:09:43.220 --> 00:09:44.780
[inaudible] and both vying for the same position.

174
00:09:45.020 --> 00:09:48.050
That's at the emperor's most trusted sidekick. They hated each other.

175
00:09:48.051 --> 00:09:51.350
And we're always looking for ways to get rid of one another. In the end,

176
00:09:51.351 --> 00:09:56.060
it was cleanser who triumphed if only for a little while and 185 AED,

177
00:09:56.061 --> 00:09:59.060
a curious scene unfolded during the capital league games,

178
00:09:59.061 --> 00:10:03.050
celebrating Jupiter as the crowd filled with this red comidas took his seat on

179
00:10:03.051 --> 00:10:04.940
the Imperial chat on old man,

180
00:10:04.970 --> 00:10:08.870
apparently dressed like a philosopher or ran out into the center of the stage.

181
00:10:08.960 --> 00:10:12.740
He said to the emperor, the sword of parentless was at his throat.

182
00:10:12.920 --> 00:10:17.090
He warms that the Praetorian prefecture was raising an army to oppose comatose

183
00:10:17.091 --> 00:10:18.650
who was sure to face death.

184
00:10:18.680 --> 00:10:21.170
If he did not deal with the threat immediately for his efforts,

185
00:10:21.171 --> 00:10:24.500
the old man was seized on the orders of Paramus and burned to death.

186
00:10:24.980 --> 00:10:26.300
Comatose did not know how to react.

187
00:10:26.360 --> 00:10:29.960
It was true that Prentice had convinced the emperor to place one of his sons in

188
00:10:29.961 --> 00:10:32.780
charge of the army at the Lyrica Roman province.

189
00:10:32.781 --> 00:10:36.650
But his suspicions were not raised enough to act against his confidence.

190
00:10:36.860 --> 00:10:40.010
Not yet at least, but another events go to short while later,

191
00:10:40.011 --> 00:10:43.520
which persuaded communists that Perez had ambitions over, throwing him.

192
00:10:43.610 --> 00:10:46.880
A group of soldiers arrived in Romans without parenthesis knowledge went

193
00:10:46.881 --> 00:10:50.300
straight to the emperor. They had come from the prefect sun in Lyrica,

194
00:10:50.340 --> 00:10:53.840
where they had discovered that he had begun minting coins with the prefects

195
00:10:53.841 --> 00:10:57.440
portrait on it. And anticipation of parenthesis claiming the throne.

196
00:10:57.530 --> 00:11:02.000
This was enough proof for commerce who had Paramus arrested and beheaded later,

197
00:11:02.060 --> 00:11:03.530
having a son killed as well.

198
00:11:03.590 --> 00:11:07.340
It is unclear whether or not this plot was actually real lens where the

199
00:11:07.730 --> 00:11:10.760
apprentice was indeed planning a coup or if it was just a ruse to get rid of

200
00:11:10.761 --> 00:11:13.460
him, perhaps engineered by his most bitter enemy Clevelander,

201
00:11:13.670 --> 00:11:16.850
her Odean makes no claim or suggestion that parentless had been the victim of a

202
00:11:16.851 --> 00:11:17.601
conspiracy,

203
00:11:17.601 --> 00:11:22.400
but Cassius DEO portrays the prefects in a positive light saying that he lived a

204
00:11:22.401 --> 00:11:26.870
most incorruptible and temperate life and he guarded commodities and the

205
00:11:26.871 --> 00:11:27.890
Imperial office.

206
00:11:27.980 --> 00:11:32.030
He also mentions that whenever something bad against Pernice a cut planter was

207
00:11:32.031 --> 00:11:34.100
there to whisper in the emperors. Yeah.

208
00:11:34.310 --> 00:11:38.180
And ultimately it was he who convinced communists to deal with the prefects

209
00:11:38.840 --> 00:11:40.130
permanently after the death of horrendous,

210
00:11:40.550 --> 00:11:43.580
who was the most powerful man in the empire after calmness, of course.

211
00:11:43.581 --> 00:11:47.990
And he refrains from no form of mischief selling or privileges and

212
00:11:47.991 --> 00:11:49.850
indulging in wantonness. And w

213
00:11:56.550 --> 00:12:00.300
The next attempted plots against communists actually came soon after this one in

214
00:12:00.301 --> 00:12:03.960
187, a D, but it was only mentioned by her audience.

215
00:12:03.961 --> 00:12:08.370
So we aren't sure how accurate it is. It concerns a soldier named Materna.

216
00:12:08.580 --> 00:12:11.100
So deserted his Legion and assembled them all without walls,

217
00:12:11.101 --> 00:12:13.200
to pillage towns and villages throughout the empire.

218
00:12:13.440 --> 00:12:17.880
It was a situation similar to that of Spartacus where maternity freed slaves and

219
00:12:18.060 --> 00:12:21.690
is ever increasing army became strong enough to attack in Ponta cities.

220
00:12:21.780 --> 00:12:23.520
Eventually the mall then digitally itself,

221
00:12:23.521 --> 00:12:27.420
and the maternity set his sights on the grandest prize possible the throne of

222
00:12:27.421 --> 00:12:31.560
Rome. However, despite his army growing to a size, he would never have expected.

223
00:12:32.040 --> 00:12:35.100
Battalion has realized that it still wasn't capable of standing toe to toe

224
00:12:35.130 --> 00:12:37.110
against the Praetorian guard. Therefore,

225
00:12:37.290 --> 00:12:41.250
we reasoned that accounting assassination plot would be preferable to an all out

226
00:12:41.251 --> 00:12:44.700
battle. Matanzas picked the perfect time for it. It was the beginning of spring,

227
00:12:44.701 --> 00:12:48.780
and the Romans were celebrating a festival honoring the goddess side. Bella,

228
00:12:48.930 --> 00:12:51.480
of course it was grand spectacle because if there was one thing,

229
00:12:51.870 --> 00:12:55.050
comatose was good at, it was throwing a party during the revelry.

230
00:12:55.080 --> 00:12:58.080
It was customary for people to dress up and on this occasion,

231
00:12:58.110 --> 00:13:00.780
no official or religious uniform was off limits.

232
00:13:00.840 --> 00:13:03.000
Anyone could dress up as anyone else.

233
00:13:03.001 --> 00:13:07.380
So maternalism is met and domes the uniform of the Praetorian God hoping that it

234
00:13:07.381 --> 00:13:10.890
would get them close to the emperor on paper. This sounded like a good plan,

235
00:13:10.891 --> 00:13:14.280
but it ended in failure as Matanzas was portrayed by some of his men,

236
00:13:14.520 --> 00:13:18.750
he was captured and executed while comidas escapes yet another attempt on his

237
00:13:18.751 --> 00:13:20.880
life by this point, comatose couldn't help.

238
00:13:20.910 --> 00:13:23.520
But notice that despite all his executions,

239
00:13:23.700 --> 00:13:26.490
there were always new people appearing who wanted him debt.

240
00:13:26.640 --> 00:13:29.070
He was never the most attentive emperor in the world,

241
00:13:29.280 --> 00:13:32.850
but these plots persuaded him to spend less and less time in public.

242
00:13:32.880 --> 00:13:33.713
It was out of Rome.

243
00:13:33.720 --> 00:13:37.350
Most of the time preferring the remoteness and security of his private estates.

244
00:13:37.380 --> 00:13:39.360
This left the empire in the charge of others,

245
00:13:39.390 --> 00:13:44.130
mainly cleanser like Peronists before him fans used his position to make himself

246
00:13:44.131 --> 00:13:47.100
the richest man in Rome, he's old governorships, military commands,

247
00:13:47.580 --> 00:13:50.760
senators ships, and even appointed 25 consoles in a single year.

248
00:13:50.880 --> 00:13:52.680
Something which had never been done before.

249
00:13:52.740 --> 00:13:56.250
He was careful to send a launch part of his money to kilometers so that the

250
00:13:56.251 --> 00:13:59.010
emperor would not feel slighted or ignored, but of course,

251
00:13:59.220 --> 00:14:02.520
nothing lasts forever and Glenda to have to fall.

252
00:14:02.640 --> 00:14:06.840
This happens in 198 D and the previous year Rehman had been hit first by a

253
00:14:06.841 --> 00:14:08.160
plague that a feminine,

254
00:14:08.190 --> 00:14:12.570
the people were angry and they blamed Leander as he became rather notorious for

255
00:14:12.571 --> 00:14:13.350
his greed.

256
00:14:13.350 --> 00:14:16.830
That was also the room at true or not that the official had hoarded large

257
00:14:16.831 --> 00:14:20.790
supplies of grain because he thought this was the one way to control the masses,

258
00:14:20.850 --> 00:14:22.470
this and the opposite effects though.

259
00:14:22.620 --> 00:14:26.580
And riots broke out as violent mobs demanded his death plans, uh,

260
00:14:26.600 --> 00:14:27.690
trying to put an end to this.

261
00:14:27.720 --> 00:14:31.710
He sends out the Imperial cavalry to chase down the rod ism gave the order to

262
00:14:31.711 --> 00:14:34.860
slaughter them all without mercy, but even this didn't work.

263
00:14:35.010 --> 00:14:38.970
Cause people barricaded that houses climbed on their roofs and started pelting

264
00:14:38.971 --> 00:14:41.100
the riders with rocks and other projectiles,

265
00:14:41.220 --> 00:14:44.880
eventually word of the rod and the bloodshed reached commiters who lived

266
00:14:44.910 --> 00:14:48.590
blissfully ignorance of the problems of the Romans plans and made sure of that

267
00:14:48.660 --> 00:14:49.141
after all.

268
00:14:49.141 --> 00:14:52.880
But this time there was nothing he could do save himself during the civil war

269
00:14:52.890 --> 00:14:53.900
was ready to break out.

270
00:14:53.940 --> 00:14:58.370
The emperor had clan to seized and beheaded and placed his head on a spear and

271
00:14:58.520 --> 00:15:02.480
sent it into the cheering crowd. Afterwards gland, his sons were killed as well.

272
00:15:02.510 --> 00:15:05.390
All of his closest associates and their bodies were again,

273
00:15:05.570 --> 00:15:09.410
turned over to the ravenous mobs suit that they could desecrate and mutilate

274
00:15:09.411 --> 00:15:13.760
them to the heart's content and satiate that blood loss as the situation quieted

275
00:15:13.761 --> 00:15:17.030
down, Commodus realized that once again, he elevated peril,

276
00:15:17.090 --> 00:15:20.540
he was angry once he understood just how much power can Andrew had managed to

277
00:15:20.541 --> 00:15:24.740
attain. So he concluded that it was time for another series of executions and

278
00:15:24.741 --> 00:15:29.330
assassinations of the prominent men of Rome who could pose a threat to him. Wow.

279
00:15:35.440 --> 00:15:38.530
You noticed by this point that we haven't spent a lot of time talking about the

280
00:15:38.531 --> 00:15:40.360
things has did as emperor.

281
00:15:40.480 --> 00:15:43.240
That's mainly because despite a lengthly 12 year reign,

282
00:15:43.270 --> 00:15:44.740
there isn't much to talk about, Oh,

283
00:15:44.910 --> 00:15:47.440
well did breakouts in Dacia and revolt in Britain,

284
00:15:47.441 --> 00:15:49.870
but these were both solved relatively quickly.

285
00:15:49.900 --> 00:15:53.140
Plus it's not like communists played any part in them. It was his generals.

286
00:15:53.141 --> 00:15:57.640
Like [inaudible] Claudius Albania's and pacinian Nijah your actives.

287
00:15:57.641 --> 00:16:01.300
And all three of them would go on to have short range zipper in the near future.

288
00:16:01.330 --> 00:16:04.930
For the majority of the rain colada stayed completely detached from his

289
00:16:04.931 --> 00:16:06.220
administrative concerns.

290
00:16:06.280 --> 00:16:10.300
He was too busy playing games and having feasts to bother himself with trivial

291
00:16:10.301 --> 00:16:12.430
matters such as or running an empire.

292
00:16:12.520 --> 00:16:15.490
It wasn't until the last few years after the death of [inaudible],

293
00:16:15.520 --> 00:16:17.530
the communists became more involved.

294
00:16:17.531 --> 00:16:22.090
And that is when he truly indulged his egomania and madness.

295
00:16:22.180 --> 00:16:25.840
For starters, he decided that he was the reincarnation of Romulus,

296
00:16:25.841 --> 00:16:27.550
the legendary founder of Rome.

297
00:16:27.970 --> 00:16:32.260
Therefore this allowed him to found the city again and rename it. Comedy Ana,

298
00:16:32.410 --> 00:16:36.250
indeed, the people were no longer Romans, but comma deans not satisfied.

299
00:16:36.610 --> 00:16:39.580
Commenters also concluded that he was the reincarnation of Hercules and had

300
00:16:39.790 --> 00:16:42.310
statues erected of him where he was depicted,

301
00:16:42.311 --> 00:16:44.050
dressed like the mythological hero,

302
00:16:44.070 --> 00:16:47.410
swinging a club and wearing the pelt of an Indian lion.

303
00:16:47.640 --> 00:16:50.740
It took on a few other names and titles and as evidenced by the official

304
00:16:50.741 --> 00:16:53.980
greeting to the Senate, the emperor Caesar, Lucius alias,

305
00:16:53.981 --> 00:16:58.870
or really as communists or Gustus Pius, Felix somatic, as dramatic as Maximus,

306
00:16:59.490 --> 00:17:02.560
Britannica, pacifier of the whole death, invincible, the Roman Hercules.

307
00:17:03.100 --> 00:17:06.940
[inaudible] Ms. Holder of the tribute and authority for the 18th time in

308
00:17:06.941 --> 00:17:10.780
parameter of the eighth time console of the seventh time father of his country

309
00:17:10.781 --> 00:17:15.610
to consoles pages. Tribunes on the fortunate comedy and Senate reading. Yes.

310
00:17:15.880 --> 00:17:19.330
All of the names that we just mentioned Coleman just use them to rename the

311
00:17:19.331 --> 00:17:21.040
months of the year in his honor,

312
00:17:21.070 --> 00:17:24.970
because he saw himself as Hercules coladas did something no other emperor had

313
00:17:24.971 --> 00:17:25.804
done before.

314
00:17:25.960 --> 00:17:29.410
He became a gladiator and actually taking parts and fights and sight the

315
00:17:30.250 --> 00:17:30.791
emphasis. Well,

316
00:17:30.791 --> 00:17:34.150
actually he was more of a Beastie Arius if we're being technical,

317
00:17:34.151 --> 00:17:37.840
as he generally prefer to fight animals and our humans. And when we say fight,

318
00:17:38.050 --> 00:17:42.160
we mean in an obviously rigged situation that pose no threat to him whatsoever.

319
00:17:42.370 --> 00:17:43.600
When he went against animals,

320
00:17:43.990 --> 00:17:47.230
comidas usually hunted them from an elevated platform where they couldn't reach

321
00:17:47.231 --> 00:17:49.860
him. Only if the animals were harmless would come at us,

322
00:17:49.870 --> 00:17:52.440
have actually entered the arena floor to give him his due.

323
00:17:52.441 --> 00:17:56.040
It appears that [inaudible] was a skilled marksman and could easily bring down

324
00:17:56.041 --> 00:17:59.790
animals from a fall with areas and javelins. If the emperor was fighting,

325
00:17:59.791 --> 00:18:02.160
other people, they obviously knew not to harm him.

326
00:18:02.190 --> 00:18:04.530
Not that they would have been able to, even if they wanted,

327
00:18:04.531 --> 00:18:08.280
as they were armed with objects, such as ones and sponges,

328
00:18:08.370 --> 00:18:10.320
and for each performance, communist paid himself.

329
00:18:10.350 --> 00:18:14.280
1 million says disease somewhere around $2 million today,

330
00:18:14.281 --> 00:18:17.640
which also made him the highest paid gladiator of all time.

331
00:18:18.180 --> 00:18:22.860
Garcia who as a Senator of room during the time of commerce was front and center

332
00:18:22.861 --> 00:18:23.970
for all of this, by the way,

333
00:18:24.090 --> 00:18:27.120
mentions one episode where the emperor beheaded an ostrich,

334
00:18:27.210 --> 00:18:30.960
he then approached the senators and pointed his bloody sore to them than the

335
00:18:30.961 --> 00:18:35.250
ostrich head suggesting that would be them one day, according to DEO,

336
00:18:35.280 --> 00:18:39.210
he and the other senators got in the habit of secretly chewing Laurel leaves

337
00:18:39.211 --> 00:18:42.270
while attending these spectacles. So as not to burst out,

338
00:18:42.271 --> 00:18:45.720
laughing in front of the emperor, all of them had to attend these events.

339
00:18:45.721 --> 00:18:49.620
And all of them did except Claudia's Palm Pena's who says that he would have

340
00:18:50.010 --> 00:18:52.860
preferred death overseeing the son of Marcus Aurelius in this business.

341
00:18:59.420 --> 00:18:59.630
<v 1>[Inaudible].</v>

342
00:18:59.630 --> 00:19:02.540
<v 0>What does sort of escaped quite a few plots against him during his reign,</v>

343
00:19:02.541 --> 00:19:06.080
but it was inevitable that eventually his time would run out.

344
00:19:06.170 --> 00:19:07.520
This happens on new year's Eve,

345
00:19:07.521 --> 00:19:11.870
192 80 during the celebrations communists wanted to make an appearance,

346
00:19:11.900 --> 00:19:14.300
not from the Imperial palace, as well as tradition,

347
00:19:14.480 --> 00:19:18.320
but from the gladiatorial barracks wearing armor and surrounded by the other

348
00:19:18.321 --> 00:19:19.154
gladiators,

349
00:19:19.310 --> 00:19:23.660
he shared his plans with Marsia his favorite mistress who then started crying

350
00:19:23.661 --> 00:19:26.360
and begging commiters not to disgrace himself in such a way.

351
00:19:26.510 --> 00:19:31.250
He also told a collector so trusted servants and Amelia's laters the Praetorian

352
00:19:31.760 --> 00:19:35.210
prefects because they reacted in a similar way. None of this changed his mind,

353
00:19:35.211 --> 00:19:35.601
of course,

354
00:19:35.601 --> 00:19:39.230
but the emperor did decide to have the three executed for their insulins and

355
00:19:39.500 --> 00:19:42.650
secretly wrote down their names on the list of people to be killed at the start

356
00:19:42.651 --> 00:19:44.180
of the new year. As it happens,

357
00:19:44.181 --> 00:19:48.140
Marcio came into possession of this list and shadow findings with latest and to

358
00:19:48.141 --> 00:19:49.790
collect us, they had this whole choice.

359
00:19:49.791 --> 00:19:53.720
It was either them or kilometers and unsurprisingly. They chose the last app.

360
00:19:53.810 --> 00:19:55.880
Later that day, as the embryo was taking a bath,

361
00:19:55.910 --> 00:19:57.620
Masia brought him a cup of wine,

362
00:19:57.621 --> 00:20:00.110
which had been poisoned Coleman has drank the whole thing,

363
00:20:00.290 --> 00:20:03.470
but it caused him to be violently ill, vomiting, the lethal liquid,

364
00:20:03.471 --> 00:20:07.010
before it had time to do its job. It was now far too late to back away.

365
00:20:07.011 --> 00:20:08.720
So the conspirators bribed a young,

366
00:20:08.721 --> 00:20:12.830
strong wrestler named narcissist to enter the bathroom and strangle the emperor.

367
00:20:12.920 --> 00:20:15.500
And so he did, and this was not only the ends of commenters,

368
00:20:15.501 --> 00:20:17.990
but also that's another ans nine dynasty.

369
00:20:18.170 --> 00:20:21.830
His death was followed by one of the most turbulent periods in Roman history,

370
00:20:22.010 --> 00:20:24.260
known as the year of the five embers.

371
00:20:24.290 --> 00:20:27.230
But we can talk about that another day.

372
00:20:27.560 --> 00:20:30.440
