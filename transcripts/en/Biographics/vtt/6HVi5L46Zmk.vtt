00:00:00.300 --> 00:00:04.020
<v 0>An energetic man is striding around the launch canvas, laid on the floor,</v>

2
00:00:04.021 --> 00:00:06.840
a half bird cigarette filter, stuck to his lips.

3
00:00:07.050 --> 00:00:10.680
He wears jeans and a white t-shirt. Despite the freezing cold in his studio,

4
00:00:10.830 --> 00:00:14.610
a large space with neither heating or electricity, the man drips, fling,

5
00:00:14.640 --> 00:00:17.940
splashes, dollops of painters. If in raptured,

6
00:00:18.630 --> 00:00:20.460
Dom's taking cues from a melody,

7
00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:25.560
which only he can hear the painting that is taking shape as an abstract pattern.

8
00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:28.260
It looks both vaguely patterns and totally random.

9
00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:30.480
Is this an expression of chaos?

10
00:00:30.600 --> 00:00:35.490
The painter might reply no chaos down it that pains with Jackson, Paul,

11
00:00:35.500 --> 00:00:38.160
like a polarizing artist, if there ever was one,

12
00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:42.750
his paintings can mesmerize art lovers. They can also incite observers to shout.

13
00:00:43.080 --> 00:00:47.730
My toddler could do it better in today's biographics we will decode his troubled

14
00:00:47.731 --> 00:00:52.140
life and hermetic art, a cocktail which features youngian psychoanalysis,

15
00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:54.360
fractals, and CIA involvement.

16
00:01:06.830 --> 00:01:07.220
<v 1>[Inaudible].</v>

17
00:01:07.220 --> 00:01:10.970
<v 0>Well, Jackson was born on January the 28th, 1912 in Cody, Wyoming.</v>

18
00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:13.640
The town took its name from its founder count or William Cody,

19
00:01:13.910 --> 00:01:17.570
better known as Buffalo bill Polix Beth place would contribute to his

20
00:01:17.571 --> 00:01:21.920
mythologized status as a cowboy zone, which was indeed a myth,

21
00:01:22.130 --> 00:01:24.620
but it was one never felt the need to correct.

22
00:01:24.680 --> 00:01:28.160
His parents were Stella may Muchler and Leroy Paula,

23
00:01:28.310 --> 00:01:30.170
or rather Laroy McCoy.

24
00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:34.160
But young Leroy had lost both his parents in the span of a few months and had

25
00:01:34.161 --> 00:01:35.450
been raised by his neighbors.

26
00:01:35.451 --> 00:01:38.210
The Pollocks Jackson was the youngest of five boys.

27
00:01:38.211 --> 00:01:42.200
All of whom stellar hoped would become artists of some kinds in her eyes.

28
00:01:42.230 --> 00:01:46.490
They were all potential geniuses, which suggests the image of a loving mother,

29
00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:47.480
proud of her children.

30
00:01:47.570 --> 00:01:51.710
But the family atmosphere may not have been that rosy a later letter written by

31
00:01:51.711 --> 00:01:52.700
one of the public boys,

32
00:01:52.701 --> 00:01:56.660
do his brother discusses Jackson's emotional instability and psychological

33
00:01:56.661 --> 00:01:59.300
problems in his eyes. These day back to his childhood,

34
00:01:59.510 --> 00:02:02.810
to his relations with his family and our mother that's also of emotional

35
00:02:02.811 --> 00:02:06.320
instability may have been tied to a constant sense of displacement.

36
00:02:06.500 --> 00:02:07.880
When Jackson was 10 months old,

37
00:02:07.881 --> 00:02:11.480
the family relocated near San Diego and eight months later to Phoenix,

38
00:02:11.960 --> 00:02:13.520
Leroy was moving around the States,

39
00:02:13.521 --> 00:02:18.020
looking for better job opportunities or buying and selling lands in 1917 when

40
00:02:18.050 --> 00:02:21.410
Jackson was five Leroy drags the family back to California,

41
00:02:21.590 --> 00:02:25.010
this time Chico all in all during the first 10 years of his life.

42
00:02:25.040 --> 00:02:29.390
Jackson lived in six different houses across three different States and

43
00:02:30.110 --> 00:02:31.340
1921, the oldest of the public boys,

44
00:02:31.370 --> 00:02:35.280
Charles moved to Los Angeles to work at the Los Angeles times and to study at

45
00:02:35.281 --> 00:02:37.190
the Otis art Institute from LA,

46
00:02:37.191 --> 00:02:40.280
he would send back home copies of art and literary magazines,

47
00:02:40.281 --> 00:02:42.200
which had a great influence on his younger brothers.

48
00:02:42.410 --> 00:02:46.130
The magazines also included reproductions of contemporary European art,

49
00:02:46.160 --> 00:02:50.270
especially of the Paris school and especially of public Casso.

50
00:02:50.300 --> 00:02:53.150
This is our Jackson's lifelong obsession with a Spanish artist.

51
00:02:53.300 --> 00:02:56.150
They have begun in 1923, the Pollocks moved back to Phoenix.

52
00:02:56.180 --> 00:02:59.800
This was another key milestone in Jackson's formative years in Arizona,

53
00:02:59.830 --> 00:03:02.800
he visited native American reservations and learns about that culture,

54
00:03:02.801 --> 00:03:06.070
their traditions, and of course their art. And is that all years,

55
00:03:06.071 --> 00:03:10.600
he admitted that his gestural or action painting technique owed a debt of

56
00:03:10.601 --> 00:03:12.870
gratitude to native American peoples,

57
00:03:12.871 --> 00:03:17.470
such as the Navaho in the Mojave that works included abstract designs painted on

58
00:03:17.471 --> 00:03:20.830
a flat area, laying on the grounds. The artists used paint. Sure,

59
00:03:20.831 --> 00:03:23.140
but also sand and other raw materials.

60
00:03:23.200 --> 00:03:26.050
Jackson did not have much time to learn from these techniques.

61
00:03:26.051 --> 00:03:30.790
This Leroy relocated again to California in 1924, three years later,

62
00:03:30.820 --> 00:03:34.540
the young was a freshman at the Riverside high school near Los Angeles.

63
00:03:34.810 --> 00:03:36.880
And it was not a nice experience.

64
00:03:36.970 --> 00:03:40.780
He didn't fit in neither with the classes nor with his classmates.

65
00:03:40.840 --> 00:03:43.660
His father wrote to the school and concerned about the boys difficulties with

66
00:03:43.661 --> 00:03:46.780
social communication. Well, he did find a way to communicate,

67
00:03:46.810 --> 00:03:50.650
but it wasn't very social Jackson engaged in violent behavior and was eventually

68
00:03:50.680 --> 00:03:53.410
expelled for fighting in March of 1928.

69
00:03:53.560 --> 00:03:57.070
Jackson moved to downtown LA and is enrolled in the manual arts high school

70
00:03:57.580 --> 00:04:02.020
garnering to further expulsions and a reputation as a rebel with, well,

71
00:04:02.140 --> 00:04:04.510
some cause this time it wasn't for fighting.

72
00:04:04.511 --> 00:04:07.870
But for participating in student protests inspired by his father,

73
00:04:07.960 --> 00:04:12.010
his socialist ideals Jackson took every opportunity to March and protest

74
00:04:12.040 --> 00:04:13.870
traditional authority. It was a busy,

75
00:04:13.871 --> 00:04:17.170
the school had him kicked out as he thoroughly enjoyed classes in drawing and

76
00:04:17.171 --> 00:04:17.830
sculpture.

77
00:04:17.830 --> 00:04:22.120
He was forming an identity of his future self as an artist and one letter to his

78
00:04:22.450 --> 00:04:24.730
brothers, Jackson Roche, as to what I would like to be.

79
00:04:24.850 --> 00:04:28.750
It is difficult to say an artist of some kind while he figured out what kind

80
00:04:28.751 --> 00:04:33.160
exactly Jackson and his brother Sanford worked for a Roy employed as a

81
00:04:33.190 --> 00:04:37.270
topographical surveyor from 1927 to 1930. During those years,

82
00:04:37.271 --> 00:04:41.170
the teenage followed Lou Ryan, his crew in surveys of the grand Canyon,

83
00:04:41.171 --> 00:04:42.970
enjoying the vast landscapes of the West.

84
00:04:43.210 --> 00:04:46.660
Unfortunately he also enjoyed something else working with rugged older,

85
00:04:46.661 --> 00:04:49.090
Matt exposed him to alcohol at a very young age.

86
00:04:49.120 --> 00:04:53.320
It became a habit then a lifelong addiction in later life as a successful

87
00:04:53.321 --> 00:04:57.100
artist, he was known for becoming aggressive after a few glasses and kicking off

88
00:04:57.101 --> 00:04:58.150
arguments at parties,

89
00:04:58.151 --> 00:05:01.750
which sometimes generated into brawls at the ends of the grand Canyon years.

90
00:05:01.960 --> 00:05:03.880
Jackson wrote to big brother Charles,

91
00:05:03.881 --> 00:05:06.550
that the so-called happy years of youth had been to him.

92
00:05:06.940 --> 00:05:08.800
A bit of a downable hell

93
00:05:15.060 --> 00:05:19.290
Joel's was definitely a big influence on Jackson and a trailblazer that led him

94
00:05:19.291 --> 00:05:21.150
into the world of art. In 1936,

95
00:05:21.180 --> 00:05:23.670
Charles had moved to New York to make it as a paint up.

96
00:05:23.820 --> 00:05:25.440
When Jackson joins him in 1930,

97
00:05:25.441 --> 00:05:28.680
the older brother introduced him to one of his teachers, notable artist,

98
00:05:28.740 --> 00:05:31.470
Thomas Hart, Benton in 1930 Jackson,

99
00:05:31.471 --> 00:05:34.020
moved in with Charles and also became a student of the Bensons.

100
00:05:34.050 --> 00:05:37.560
This is the period in which public's formal training really took off when his

101
00:05:37.590 --> 00:05:42.390
disparate influences coalesced and when his style became more distinctive Benson

102
00:05:42.420 --> 00:05:46.770
introduced him to Italian masters of the Renaissance to Mexican muralists like

103
00:05:46.800 --> 00:05:48.300
Siqueros and Riviera.

104
00:05:48.301 --> 00:05:52.680
And so the movements that he champions American regionalism public's work in the

105
00:05:52.681 --> 00:05:56.220
mid 1930s reflects Benson's influence take the painting.

106
00:05:56.250 --> 00:06:00.530
Cotton pickers for the stall is still clearly figurative the subject massive

107
00:06:00.531 --> 00:06:02.780
deals with social injustice in a rural setting,

108
00:06:02.960 --> 00:06:06.770
both elements are typical of the regionalist style and both are elements which

109
00:06:06.771 --> 00:06:09.980
forms an important stepping stone in Pollock's career.

110
00:06:09.980 --> 00:06:13.940
Although he would eventually break away from recognizable figures and from

111
00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:18.680
explicitly political themes in the late 1930s and early 1940s Jackson was

112
00:06:18.681 --> 00:06:22.400
exposed to another source of profound inspiration in attempts to find his

113
00:06:22.401 --> 00:06:24.740
alcoholism, anger issues, and bouts of depression.

114
00:06:24.920 --> 00:06:28.790
Paula comes to when psychotherapy sessions first with Dr. Joseph Henderson from

115
00:06:28.791 --> 00:06:30.320
1938 to 1941.

116
00:06:30.500 --> 00:06:35.480
And then with Dr. Violet stabbed a Lazio in 1941 and 90, 42,

117
00:06:35.750 --> 00:06:37.550
his therapists introduced Jackson.

118
00:06:37.551 --> 00:06:42.140
So the methods of call Gustave young and especially the concept of youngian

119
00:06:42.170 --> 00:06:44.000
unconscious. According to him,

120
00:06:44.030 --> 00:06:47.450
the human psyche includes three main interacting systems, the ego,

121
00:06:47.600 --> 00:06:50.420
the personal unconscious and the collective unconscious,

122
00:06:50.630 --> 00:06:54.110
the ego represents the conscious mind. And as it comprises, the thoughts,

123
00:06:54.200 --> 00:06:55.700
memories, and emotions,

124
00:06:55.730 --> 00:06:59.870
we are aware of the personal unconscious contains forgotten information and

125
00:06:59.900 --> 00:07:01.550
personal repressed memories.

126
00:07:01.730 --> 00:07:06.050
The collective unconscious is instead shared by members of the human species and

127
00:07:06.051 --> 00:07:10.520
is made up of late memories from my ancestral and evolutionary past.

128
00:07:10.730 --> 00:07:13.730
When Paula found it difficult to communicate his feelings to Dr. Henderson,

129
00:07:13.970 --> 00:07:15.830
he brought along some of his sketches.

130
00:07:16.070 --> 00:07:19.850
That's out of 83 drawings dating from this period is known as the psychoanalytic

131
00:07:20.480 --> 00:07:23.540
drawings. They capture a transitional periods in Pallex Korea.

132
00:07:23.780 --> 00:07:27.260
He is leaving behind his early figurative work and shifting towards what would

133
00:07:27.261 --> 00:07:30.170
become his signature style abstract expressionism.

134
00:07:30.260 --> 00:07:33.890
The drawings display the clear influence of Young's theory as public uses

135
00:07:33.891 --> 00:07:37.790
symbols, belonging to the collective unconscious symbols, like the snake.

136
00:07:37.850 --> 00:07:38.571
According to young,

137
00:07:38.571 --> 00:07:43.190
this is a stand-in for sex or for the baser lower parts of human nature.

138
00:07:43.250 --> 00:07:46.550
In fact, snakes often appear at the bottom of Pollock's work at the top.

139
00:07:46.580 --> 00:07:50.990
One may find suns, moons and eyes symbols of higher psychic States,

140
00:07:51.050 --> 00:07:53.960
the sun disk and moon crescents, two of public's favorites.

141
00:07:54.110 --> 00:07:57.620
The sun symbolizes the male unconscious elements of the psyche while the moon

142
00:07:57.621 --> 00:07:58.850
represents femininity.

143
00:07:58.850 --> 00:08:02.690
And the unconscious likes to combine the symbols into a launch or shape,

144
00:08:02.810 --> 00:08:05.720
according to professor Michael layer of Pennsylvania university,

145
00:08:05.840 --> 00:08:10.040
this may indicate and attempted reconciliating the artist's conscious and

146
00:08:10.041 --> 00:08:14.690
unconscious States Pollock's work started to show another sign of the effects of

147
00:08:14.691 --> 00:08:17.120
the unconscious in the early 1940s.

148
00:08:17.180 --> 00:08:21.290
This is the period in which started to incorporate pain dripping on a horizontal

149
00:08:21.291 --> 00:08:23.390
canvas, as a preferred technique.

150
00:08:23.420 --> 00:08:27.320
The act of dripping paints by using brushes sticks or even Turkey based is had

151
00:08:27.321 --> 00:08:30.650
been influenced by native American artists as we have seen,

152
00:08:30.680 --> 00:08:34.700
but also by the Mexican painter Securus, according to Michael free,

153
00:08:34.730 --> 00:08:36.830
there is a further collective force at work.

154
00:08:36.831 --> 00:08:40.280
And that is the unconscious mind influenced about union studies.

155
00:08:40.730 --> 00:08:42.800
may have given free reign to his unconscious.

156
00:08:42.801 --> 00:08:47.270
The apparently random lines created by paint dripping of the embodiment of pure

157
00:08:47.271 --> 00:08:50.450
energy generated by repressed memories. The piece of art,

158
00:08:50.451 --> 00:08:54.680
which perfectly exemplifies youngian unconscious of play is guardians of the

159
00:08:54.681 --> 00:08:58.680
secret. 1943, the canvas features a painting within a painting.

160
00:08:58.690 --> 00:09:02.610
A rectangular shape filled with abstract markings is flanked by two figures,

161
00:09:02.640 --> 00:09:04.740
stylized renditions of a man and a woman.

162
00:09:04.770 --> 00:09:08.610
The central rectangle may be a representation of the unconscious with its

163
00:09:08.611 --> 00:09:12.090
chaotic expression kept in check by the two human figures.

164
00:09:12.210 --> 00:09:17.010
These figures may symbolize the animals and the animal young describes these as

165
00:09:17.011 --> 00:09:19.800
the mirror images of aren't biological sex. For example,

166
00:09:19.830 --> 00:09:23.760
men would have an animal that unconscious feminine side young wants to find the

167
00:09:23.761 --> 00:09:26.880
animus and anima as guardians of the threshold.

168
00:09:26.881 --> 00:09:31.200
A definition which public borrowed for the paintings title guardians was the

169
00:09:31.201 --> 00:09:33.990
most striking piece in Pollock's first set of exhibition.

170
00:09:34.320 --> 00:09:35.610
And it got him noticed.

171
00:09:41.540 --> 00:09:41.930
<v 3>[Inaudible].</v>

172
00:09:41.930 --> 00:09:42.763
<v 0>In particular,</v>

173
00:09:42.800 --> 00:09:46.670
polar caught the eye of wealthy art collector and patron Peggy Guggenheim.

174
00:09:46.760 --> 00:09:49.880
Peggy went to visit Jackson that's the flatty shed in New York with his

175
00:09:49.881 --> 00:09:51.320
girlfriends Lee Krasner.

176
00:09:51.410 --> 00:09:55.460
Lee was also a painter who would go on to have a long and influential career

177
00:09:55.550 --> 00:09:57.350
after climbing four long flights of stairs.

178
00:09:57.351 --> 00:10:00.800
The exhausted Peggy found nobody home just when she was about to leave the

179
00:10:00.801 --> 00:10:04.610
building. She bumped into a drunk Jackson back from a friend's wedding party.

180
00:10:04.700 --> 00:10:06.980
They in Jackson showed Peggy their respective works.

181
00:10:07.130 --> 00:10:10.790
The patron was mildly interested in politics and totally dismissive of

182
00:10:10.791 --> 00:10:13.720
crassness. There may have been some jealousy at work they're Guggenheim.

183
00:10:13.820 --> 00:10:15.980
They have developed. And in fact, uation with pelicans,

184
00:10:16.100 --> 00:10:18.470
always resented Lee's presence in his life.

185
00:10:18.590 --> 00:10:20.930
Peggy walked away irritated by politics behavior,

186
00:10:20.931 --> 00:10:23.150
but impressed by his looks and charisma.

187
00:10:23.240 --> 00:10:27.200
Ultimately it was her advisor pens out Marcel to chomp who convinced her to give

188
00:10:27.201 --> 00:10:30.290
Jackson a chance. And so it was that in July of 1943,

189
00:10:30.710 --> 00:10:34.010
received a commission to create a mural for Peggy's new townhouse.

190
00:10:34.160 --> 00:10:36.800
He was free to choose the subjects, but not the size.

191
00:10:36.830 --> 00:10:38.870
The work needed to cover an entire wall,

192
00:10:39.050 --> 00:10:43.970
81 feet long and almost 20 feet high chose to paint with oil on canvas

193
00:10:43.971 --> 00:10:47.840
rather than directly on the wall, even. So the size of the frame was huge.

194
00:10:47.900 --> 00:10:50.930
His studio was divided into two rooms, none of which was large enough.

195
00:10:51.380 --> 00:10:53.180
Paula ended up tearing down the petition ball.

196
00:10:53.270 --> 00:10:54.650
The deadline was November the sixth,

197
00:10:54.680 --> 00:10:58.580
the days in which Guggenheim that offered to stage an exhibition of Publix art

198
00:10:58.850 --> 00:11:01.940
Jackson immediately set to work, except he didn't.

199
00:11:02.120 --> 00:11:04.040
The artist was going through a rough patch.

200
00:11:04.160 --> 00:11:07.610
It's dipping back into depression and public experienced and artistic block and

201
00:11:07.611 --> 00:11:11.270
spent weeks staring at the empty canvas. He missed the November deadline,

202
00:11:11.271 --> 00:11:13.100
but surely afterward he had a vision,

203
00:11:13.430 --> 00:11:17.810
a stampede of every animal in the American West cows and horses and antelopes

204
00:11:17.811 --> 00:11:18.620
and buffaloes.

205
00:11:18.620 --> 00:11:23.510
Everything is charging across that surface driven by this rapture painted

206
00:11:23.511 --> 00:11:27.770
his mural in a single burst of energy around new year's day of 1944.

207
00:11:27.830 --> 00:11:32.270
The stampede had morphed into a kinetic tsunami of abstract shapes.

208
00:11:32.510 --> 00:11:35.690
Mural was recognized as a turning point for American art and it helped put

209
00:11:35.691 --> 00:11:37.730
Jackson on the artistic map of New York.

210
00:11:37.820 --> 00:11:40.940
He could count on the Guggenheim patronage, of course, but most importantly,

211
00:11:41.120 --> 00:11:44.570
he was champions by influential art, grey sick Kevin's greenback.

212
00:11:44.930 --> 00:11:48.110
I took one look at it and I thought, now that's great art.

213
00:11:48.200 --> 00:11:51.740
And I knew Jackson was the painter. This country had produced

214
00:11:58.550 --> 00:12:00.510
Was 45 Jackson and Lee tied the knots.

215
00:12:00.511 --> 00:12:02.700
And in November they moved into the new house,

216
00:12:02.701 --> 00:12:07.020
say 230 Springs fireplace road in Springs, long Island,

217
00:12:07.050 --> 00:12:10.440
New York Jackson converted a nearby barn into a large studio,

218
00:12:10.470 --> 00:12:13.290
large enough to lay enormous canvases on the floor.

219
00:12:13.590 --> 00:12:15.780
Three from the constraints of the traditional easel,

220
00:12:15.930 --> 00:12:19.200
the painter was able to perfect the technique for which he became famous.

221
00:12:19.260 --> 00:12:23.220
The technique has become known as drip painting or action painting or gestural

222
00:12:23.221 --> 00:12:26.280
painting by defining the convention of painting on an upright surface.

223
00:12:26.430 --> 00:12:29.010
Paul encountered a new dimension to his creative process.

224
00:12:29.160 --> 00:12:33.420
He was now able to view and applying paints to his canvases from all directions

225
00:12:33.510 --> 00:12:36.960
and not just any artists, paint, preferred household paints,

226
00:12:36.990 --> 00:12:40.200
varnishes and enamels to drip and fling. These materials,

227
00:12:40.500 --> 00:12:42.210
public used hardens brushes sticks,

228
00:12:42.420 --> 00:12:46.230
and even basting syringes in the process of perfecting the star public moved

229
00:12:46.231 --> 00:12:48.390
away from figurative representation,

230
00:12:48.420 --> 00:12:51.420
even avoiding vague shadows of recognizable shapes.

231
00:12:51.690 --> 00:12:55.560
His work Lucifer of 1947 is a good example of this transition.

232
00:12:55.920 --> 00:12:59.100
Public had started this painting by applying color to the canvas in a

233
00:12:59.101 --> 00:13:03.420
traditional way. But halfway through the process, he went into full action mode.

234
00:13:03.510 --> 00:13:07.080
He dripped spattered pigments on an underlayer into which he had embedded small

235
00:13:07.081 --> 00:13:10.320
pieces of gravel to increase the text jet while completing Lucifer Polich

236
00:13:10.321 --> 00:13:12.090
devised another original technique.

237
00:13:12.150 --> 00:13:14.040
Every time he had to dip his brush into varnish,

238
00:13:14.070 --> 00:13:16.590
the interruption to his free hand movements restricted him.

239
00:13:16.710 --> 00:13:18.630
He then tried to tilt a can of household panes,

240
00:13:18.631 --> 00:13:20.880
allowing it to run down a stick at the right angle.

241
00:13:21.120 --> 00:13:23.340
Lucifer runs other similar works to the period,

242
00:13:23.341 --> 00:13:26.790
debuted at the Betty Parsons gallery in New York in 1948.

243
00:13:27.060 --> 00:13:28.770
You would think that with Greenberg behind him,

244
00:13:28.771 --> 00:13:33.030
the exhibition would be a success best. No, it was a critical disaster.

245
00:13:33.090 --> 00:13:37.410
The wider general public in the U S are simply not yet ready for Pallex action

246
00:13:37.411 --> 00:13:39.390
paintings. Europe was a different story there.

247
00:13:39.540 --> 00:13:43.380
Peggy Guggenheim constantly moving between New York and Venice took the occasion

248
00:13:43.381 --> 00:13:46.680
to show six of Pollock's works at the prestigious Venice monopoly.

249
00:13:46.710 --> 00:13:50.220
The paintings were greatly appreciated by Italian and European critics.

250
00:13:50.250 --> 00:13:52.560
And so the talk continued into Milan and Florence.

251
00:13:52.650 --> 00:13:54.990
It's worth mentioning that just a couple of years earlier,

252
00:13:54.991 --> 00:13:58.740
the us state department had sponsored a touring exhibition of other American

253
00:13:58.741 --> 00:14:00.150
abstract expressionists,

254
00:14:00.151 --> 00:14:04.170
the same school to which public belonged the exhibition was called advancing

255
00:14:04.171 --> 00:14:05.004
American art.

256
00:14:05.130 --> 00:14:09.600
It had the explicit intention of showcasing American abstract artists in Europe

257
00:14:09.810 --> 00:14:12.470
and beyond the iron curtain. The message was clear.

258
00:14:12.510 --> 00:14:16.920
The U S was the home of the free open to all forms of artistic expression,

259
00:14:17.070 --> 00:14:21.480
as opposed to the drab stage controlled realist arts coming from communist bloc

260
00:14:21.510 --> 00:14:25.710
countries. Now keep that in mind shortly after Pollock's European exhibitions,

261
00:14:25.920 --> 00:14:28.260
Jackson made it to the mainstream on August the eighth,

262
00:14:28.270 --> 00:14:31.200
1949 readers of life magazine got to know the painter.

263
00:14:31.290 --> 00:14:35.190
He appeared as a brooding puzzled looking man on a two-page spread,

264
00:14:35.191 --> 00:14:37.500
standing in front of one of his large murals.

265
00:14:37.560 --> 00:14:41.070
The title of the article reds is either the greatest living painter in the

266
00:14:41.071 --> 00:14:41.904
United States,

267
00:14:48.660 --> 00:14:51.210
49 and the early 1950s was on a roll.

268
00:14:51.380 --> 00:14:54.110
This is when he produced number one and autumn rhythm.

269
00:14:54.140 --> 00:14:58.250
Arguably the two examples in which abstract expressionism and action painting

270
00:14:58.251 --> 00:15:00.980
are at their highest pallet. These large canvases lack,

271
00:15:01.010 --> 00:15:03.950
a central point of focus. There is no hierarchy,

272
00:15:03.980 --> 00:15:06.020
no dominance of one elements over the other.

273
00:15:06.110 --> 00:15:08.480
Every bit of the surface is equally important.

274
00:15:08.920 --> 00:15:12.500
Pollexfen own Europeans or at no further motive than to advance his own art.

275
00:15:12.501 --> 00:15:13.850
And apparently it worked.

276
00:15:13.940 --> 00:15:17.900
His paintings had to establish credibility in Europe before being appreciated at

277
00:15:17.901 --> 00:15:21.560
home. Despite the wave of success and appreciation critics was still divided.

278
00:15:21.590 --> 00:15:25.640
If life had politics back telling magazine dismissed his art as chaos,

279
00:15:25.790 --> 00:15:29.000
hence his famous reply via telegram, no chaos,

280
00:15:30.230 --> 00:15:33.890
Pollack firmly stated that he had a clear idea of how he wanted a particular

281
00:15:33.891 --> 00:15:35.660
piece to appear more precisely.

282
00:15:36.440 --> 00:15:40.070
FM's complete control over the movements of his implements, his hands,

283
00:15:40.310 --> 00:15:42.530
his body random forces did come into play.

284
00:15:42.530 --> 00:15:46.190
When the paint fell over the canvas and accepted that the viscosity of the

285
00:15:46.191 --> 00:15:49.880
material, the absorption factor of the canvas, even the force of gravity,

286
00:15:49.940 --> 00:15:53.660
those were the uncontrollable elements, wrestling with the controllable ones,

287
00:15:53.810 --> 00:15:57.620
creating a synthesis new meaning perhaps in public's mind.

288
00:15:57.621 --> 00:16:01.430
It was similar to how the human psyche and human behavior are a result of

289
00:16:01.431 --> 00:16:05.330
conscious and unconscious factors. Finally, Polak regains control.

290
00:16:05.420 --> 00:16:07.550
As the abstract images took shape on the canvas.

291
00:16:07.551 --> 00:16:10.280
It was he who decided what colors or lines to add,

292
00:16:10.550 --> 00:16:14.000
and he would not stop until he saw what he wanted to see. Contemporary myths,

293
00:16:14.001 --> 00:16:16.580
depict Jackson, as a Bewitched artist,

294
00:16:16.581 --> 00:16:21.110
high on alcohol who randomly flung pains while ecstatically dancing to the

295
00:16:21.111 --> 00:16:25.190
improvisational jazz of masters, like Charlie Parker, his wife,

296
00:16:25.191 --> 00:16:26.900
Lee Krasner later denied this.

297
00:16:27.020 --> 00:16:30.680
Not only did his studio lack the electricity needed to plug in a record player,

298
00:16:30.860 --> 00:16:35.480
but didn't really dig those cans, blurting out bebop and cool jazz.

299
00:16:35.600 --> 00:16:39.410
He preferred old-fashioned big band classics. If the Dixieland era,

300
00:16:39.590 --> 00:16:42.290
this myth was further dispels by the analysis of art critic.

301
00:16:42.291 --> 00:16:44.540
Robert Good Norton's have a Carmel.

302
00:16:44.600 --> 00:16:47.600
They just don't do a documentary of Polica at work shot by filmmaker.

303
00:16:47.900 --> 00:16:52.520
Hans namer fins were able to describe Jackson's working method in four phases.

304
00:16:52.760 --> 00:16:53.593
Phase one,

305
00:16:53.840 --> 00:16:57.470
start your masterpiece by tracing some loosely representational figures,

306
00:16:57.590 --> 00:17:00.590
phase two, immediately over paint and obscure. These figures.

307
00:17:00.620 --> 00:17:04.730
These two phases should take it up two hours and leave you awesomely exhausted.

308
00:17:04.910 --> 00:17:07.790
Phase three, take a can of black or dark enamel dip,

309
00:17:07.791 --> 00:17:10.220
a stubby brush and move your arm rhythmic knee.

310
00:17:10.250 --> 00:17:13.940
The pains will drip fall and splash in a variety of movements onto the surface.

311
00:17:14.120 --> 00:17:15.020
Within half an hour,

312
00:17:15.021 --> 00:17:19.160
the entire surface will be covered in weaving rhythms and patterns. Phase four,

313
00:17:19.220 --> 00:17:20.270
over the following two weeks,

314
00:17:20.390 --> 00:17:22.520
you will get accustomed to the painting resounding to it,

315
00:17:22.521 --> 00:17:26.240
to apply additional layers of color in a slower and more deliberate fashion.

316
00:17:26.450 --> 00:17:29.120
Good noughts and CommonWell gave a good description of the process.

317
00:17:29.270 --> 00:17:30.920
When it came to interpreting the results.

318
00:17:30.980 --> 00:17:35.450
We just have to quote the much later studies published on nature by Richard

319
00:17:35.450 --> 00:17:37.700
Taylor, Adam McCullough, and David Jonas.

320
00:17:37.850 --> 00:17:41.150
The researchers analyzed autumn rhythm among other works and realized that

321
00:17:41.450 --> 00:17:43.610
Pollock's paintings presented fractal patterns,

322
00:17:43.760 --> 00:17:47.480
practicals that never ending infinitely complex patterns that are self-similar.

323
00:17:47.481 --> 00:17:50.070
Whether you view them from up close from very far away,

324
00:17:50.220 --> 00:17:51.900
the trio of authors found assumption,

325
00:17:51.901 --> 00:17:55.710
geometric regularity in the apparently irregular surfaces of Pollock's

326
00:17:55.711 --> 00:17:58.560
masterpieces. But what was the meaning behind this?

327
00:17:58.620 --> 00:17:59.850
The three main interpretations,

328
00:17:59.851 --> 00:18:02.790
all the public ones had to replicate fractals observed in nature,

329
00:18:02.820 --> 00:18:04.770
such as trees or coastlines,

330
00:18:04.771 --> 00:18:08.370
or that he wanted to represent a mathematical model of a fractal.

331
00:18:08.530 --> 00:18:12.090
The fracture is observed on the canvas where simply an unintentional

332
00:18:12.091 --> 00:18:14.700
representation of Pollock's movements. In other words,

333
00:18:14.701 --> 00:18:18.780
the painting was merely an object to trace left behind by the events of the

334
00:18:19.140 --> 00:18:22.710
artist, working in a studio. And that the events is what counted

335
00:18:28.970 --> 00:18:32.090
Regardless of interpretations descriptions and explanations.

336
00:18:32.240 --> 00:18:34.430
Jackson was huge by the 1950s,

337
00:18:34.460 --> 00:18:38.360
he was seen as the leader of the new Vanguard of abstract expressionists,

338
00:18:38.390 --> 00:18:41.390
Peggy Guggenheim and Greenberg had played that part. Sure,

339
00:18:41.391 --> 00:18:42.710
but Polycon his mates.

340
00:18:42.950 --> 00:18:47.900
Good counts on one more powerful ally that us government and the CIA remember

341
00:18:47.901 --> 00:18:51.860
the exhibits and tour organized by the state department in 1947. Well,

342
00:18:51.950 --> 00:18:55.040
it's a backfire. It emerged that many abstract expressionists,

343
00:18:55.041 --> 00:18:57.890
including Polak were socialists or communists.

344
00:18:58.160 --> 00:19:01.130
This prompted the political establishment to condemn their art.

345
00:19:01.220 --> 00:19:05.990
Senator George Lindero declared all modern art is communistic Harold

346
00:19:06.350 --> 00:19:07.071
hobby or Los Angeles.

347
00:19:07.071 --> 00:19:11.090
Councilman gave us this Pell modern art is actually a means of espionage.

348
00:19:11.240 --> 00:19:15.050
If you know how to read them, modern paintings will disclose weak spots in us,

349
00:19:15.051 --> 00:19:17.780
fortifications and such crucial constructions.

350
00:19:17.990 --> 00:19:22.160
As the Boulder dam paintings are secret missives to the USSR about American weak

351
00:19:22.161 --> 00:19:25.340
points. Well, there's probably a movie there somewhere,

352
00:19:25.341 --> 00:19:29.360
or at least a good conspiracy theory circles within the state department.

353
00:19:29.361 --> 00:19:30.081
And CIA though,

354
00:19:30.081 --> 00:19:33.110
still felt that sponsoring American modern art would be a good plan.

355
00:19:33.170 --> 00:19:36.950
The end game was to display Soviet realist art from getting any traction in

356
00:19:36.951 --> 00:19:39.770
Europe, but they could not do it openly. Conveniently.

357
00:19:39.771 --> 00:19:43.280
The presidents of the museum of modern art and New York was Nelson Rockefeller,

358
00:19:43.490 --> 00:19:47.300
whose connections with the CIA and the diplomatic service with deep rooted.

359
00:19:47.360 --> 00:19:50.930
So in 1952, the CIA gave MoMA a five-year grants,

360
00:19:51.290 --> 00:19:55.010
father Rockefeller brothers funds. In order to funds the international program,

361
00:19:55.070 --> 00:19:58.790
the museum was able to organize 33 international exhibitions of abstract

362
00:19:58.791 --> 00:20:02.180
expressionists art across four years with CIA money,

363
00:20:02.181 --> 00:20:06.410
European galleries were flooded with works by, Mark Rothko, Willem de Kooning,

364
00:20:06.411 --> 00:20:08.060
and similar artists in the same year.

365
00:20:08.450 --> 00:20:12.680
produced convergence collage of colors that created most of all shapes and

366
00:20:12.681 --> 00:20:16.040
lines, evoking, violent emotions, real assault on the eye,

367
00:20:16.100 --> 00:20:20.090
surely not very accessible. And yet it became his best known work.

368
00:20:20.091 --> 00:20:23.090
Thanks to the promotion grants ed by the international program.

369
00:20:23.091 --> 00:20:25.040
And to the fact that his nature,

370
00:20:25.041 --> 00:20:28.820
it was turned into a best-selling jigsaw puzzle that has often happens with

371
00:20:28.821 --> 00:20:30.440
successful, but troubled artists,

372
00:20:30.441 --> 00:20:34.610
the pressures of notoriety contributed to Pollock's personal deterioration.

373
00:20:34.700 --> 00:20:36.050
His bouts of depression, worsened,

374
00:20:36.170 --> 00:20:40.400
his alcoholism deepened his behavior became more erratic and anecdote of the

375
00:20:40.401 --> 00:20:43.640
time tells us how he wants walked into an after show, party, stock,

376
00:20:43.730 --> 00:20:48.700
and acres and urinated into a fireplace in 1955 painted scent and such,

377
00:20:48.701 --> 00:20:52.060
which would be his last to officially recognize paintings.

378
00:20:52.180 --> 00:20:53.500
According to a friend Jeffrey Potter,

379
00:20:53.680 --> 00:20:58.540
the following year became an abyss of non productivity spends by Jackson in a

380
00:20:58.541 --> 00:21:00.430
death trance on a personal level.

381
00:21:00.490 --> 00:21:02.740
His marriage with Lee had deteriorated as well.

382
00:21:03.460 --> 00:21:06.850
Mocking twin calamities during a night's Ben's drinking at his favorite bar,

383
00:21:06.880 --> 00:21:11.110
the Cedar Jackson Massey 26 year old model and gallerist the beautiful reef

384
00:21:11.620 --> 00:21:14.500
Clayman. According to Ruth, the meeting had been coincidental.

385
00:21:14.530 --> 00:21:16.240
According to artist, Audrey flack,

386
00:21:16.241 --> 00:21:20.140
she had precise plans to seduce the top artist of the New York scene.

387
00:21:20.260 --> 00:21:22.150
In any case, the two began a target effect.

388
00:21:22.300 --> 00:21:26.080
Their relationship was only physical at first, but soon after they fell in love.

389
00:21:26.200 --> 00:21:29.320
Lee was understandably distraught and decided to move out of their home in

390
00:21:29.321 --> 00:21:31.180
Springs, boarding a cruise ship to Europe,

391
00:21:31.390 --> 00:21:34.960
Ruth moved in the very same day during the early months of that love affair.

392
00:21:35.410 --> 00:21:37.930
Kingdon was frustrated by Pollock's lack of interest in art.

393
00:21:38.230 --> 00:21:39.370
Then one day in July,

394
00:21:39.371 --> 00:21:43.540
she insisted he painted a new piece for her public relented and set to work.

395
00:21:43.600 --> 00:21:47.140
The result, according to Ruth was the piece red, black, and silver.

396
00:21:47.230 --> 00:21:50.680
Although the attribution is disputed by most art critics, add Jackson,

397
00:21:50.980 --> 00:21:53.770
found new inspiration, the new muse and reef.

398
00:21:53.890 --> 00:21:57.490
What do you have crawled out of his trance ready to revolutionize the art?

399
00:21:57.490 --> 00:22:00.790
Well to get again? Well, one of a note on August the 11th,

400
00:22:00.800 --> 00:22:04.480
1956 at 10:15 PM, Jackson, Ruth, and their friends,

401
00:22:04.510 --> 00:22:06.460
Edith Metzger with driving in politics,

402
00:22:06.461 --> 00:22:09.670
Oldsmobile convertible Jackson was at the wheel driving under the influence of

403
00:22:09.671 --> 00:22:12.040
alcohol, less than a mile away from his Springs home,

404
00:22:12.070 --> 00:22:16.030
the Oldsmobile veered off the road and crashed. Ruth was the only survivor.

405
00:22:16.150 --> 00:22:19.780
The relationship between Lee and Jackson at the end may have been stormy for

406
00:22:19.781 --> 00:22:24.250
sure, but after Pollock's death, Krasner kept his memory and legacy alive.

407
00:22:24.370 --> 00:22:28.330
She ensured that his short-lived fame did not beat her out snuffed by the new

408
00:22:28.331 --> 00:22:31.150
American trends, such as pop art and realism,

409
00:22:31.360 --> 00:22:35.920
definitely more figurative and style politics. Art was divided in its Genesis.

410
00:22:36.070 --> 00:22:38.950
It came from a struggle between conscious and unconscious.

411
00:22:38.951 --> 00:22:42.430
It derived from controllable and uncontrollable elements.

412
00:22:42.431 --> 00:22:46.660
It was driven by anti conformism, but backed by the establishment.

413
00:22:46.780 --> 00:22:49.690
And so his legacy was, and still is divisive.

414
00:22:49.930 --> 00:22:54.310
You may love him or you may despise him, but surely you can't ignore him.

415
00:22:54.820 --> 00:22:57.100
