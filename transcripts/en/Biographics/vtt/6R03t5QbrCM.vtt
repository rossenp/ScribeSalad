<v 0>Just before we get started,</v>

2
00:00:01.021 --> 00:00:03.480
some of you might know that I have another channel called mega projects,

3
00:00:03.481 --> 00:00:07.980
which is all about mega-projects. If you don't please do subscribe to us well,

4
00:00:07.981 --> 00:00:08.880
by popular demand,

5
00:00:08.910 --> 00:00:12.510
I wanted to cover some things on that channel that weren't quite mega enough for

6
00:00:12.511 --> 00:00:16.260
it. So I present to you a brand new channel side projects,

7
00:00:16.261 --> 00:00:20.520
covering secret Soviet space, weapons, world war two's, greatest airplanes,

8
00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:24.600
histories, lost treasures, and a whole lot more new videos,

9
00:00:24.601 --> 00:00:26.160
three times a week on that channel.

10
00:00:26.161 --> 00:00:29.190
So if you're thinking Simon doesn't make enough videos for me, well,

11
00:00:29.191 --> 00:00:32.460
problem-solved link below and let's get into it

12
00:00:38.510 --> 00:00:41.390
Today. We take a look at a pirates I'm like any other Steed bonus,

13
00:00:41.630 --> 00:00:45.650
the gentleman pirates so-called because he came from a life of luxury and

14
00:00:45.651 --> 00:00:47.900
leisure. He was wealthy. He was well-educated.

15
00:00:48.020 --> 00:00:50.030
He was influential in high society.

16
00:00:50.031 --> 00:00:54.740
And yet he left that life behind and instead decided to become a pirate,

17
00:00:54.920 --> 00:00:55.670
his motivation,

18
00:00:55.670 --> 00:01:00.080
whatever it was already makes him unique among the pirates we've covered on this

19
00:01:00.081 --> 00:01:00.501
channel.

20
00:01:00.501 --> 00:01:04.760
But another original aspects of botanists was that he was completely ill

21
00:01:04.761 --> 00:01:08.240
prepared for life. As a pirate captain, he didn't know how to sail.

22
00:01:08.360 --> 00:01:11.810
He didn't know how to navigate, and he didn't know how to fight,

23
00:01:11.930 --> 00:01:14.690
but that did not deter him in the slightest.

24
00:01:14.870 --> 00:01:17.510
Although it did cause some slight friction with his men,

25
00:01:17.810 --> 00:01:20.540
this almost makes him a sort of comical character,

26
00:01:20.541 --> 00:01:23.960
especially when compared to his peers, but to everyone's surprise,

27
00:01:23.990 --> 00:01:26.420
he wasn't the most terrible pirate in the world.

28
00:01:26.480 --> 00:01:30.290
He took his fair share of prizes and secured long lasting notoriety for himself.

29
00:01:30.320 --> 00:01:33.620
Thanks mainly to his association with black debt. In the end, though,

30
00:01:33.740 --> 00:01:38.060
Steve bonnet proved to be a tragic figure as the rest of the world wasn't as

31
00:01:38.080 --> 00:01:42.560
impressed or amused by his antics. And ultimately he shared the same harsh face.

32
00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:43.880
As most of us Confederate.

33
00:01:50.270 --> 00:01:53.990
Steve Barnett was born in 1688 on the islands of Barbados.

34
00:01:54.170 --> 00:01:57.320
He came from a wealthy family. His parents had a large plantation,

35
00:01:57.321 --> 00:02:01.100
a couple of miles from the Barbadian Capitol of Bridgetown and he inherited it

36
00:02:01.101 --> 00:02:02.360
all. Once his parents died,

37
00:02:02.480 --> 00:02:06.140
he received a good education and was brought up to be a proper and upstanding

38
00:02:06.141 --> 00:02:08.420
member of society. As a young adult bonnet,

39
00:02:08.421 --> 00:02:13.310
married a woman named Mary Allenby in 1709 and together they had four children

40
00:02:13.580 --> 00:02:17.060
through the years. He saw his standing in society, steadily improve.

41
00:02:17.150 --> 00:02:19.520
His wife was also the daughter of a wealthy planter.

42
00:02:19.521 --> 00:02:23.720
So he got a large dowery by marrying her and his own plantation seemed to

43
00:02:23.721 --> 00:02:24.350
thrive.

44
00:02:24.350 --> 00:02:27.950
He joined the British army and services and the local militia where he attained

45
00:02:27.951 --> 00:02:32.090
the rank of major. In other words, Steve bonnets seemingly had everything.

46
00:02:32.330 --> 00:02:34.580
That's a man of the era could have a once.

47
00:02:34.820 --> 00:02:37.850
And yet he did something strange in 17, 17,

48
00:02:37.851 --> 00:02:42.050
something that puzzled his contemporaries and still puzzles historians to this

49
00:02:42.051 --> 00:02:45.890
day, he gave up his life and decided he wants to become a pirate.

50
00:02:46.010 --> 00:02:49.010
What exactly prompted phonics to do this remains a mystery.

51
00:02:49.040 --> 00:02:53.210
The main motives why men turned to piracy in those days was because they didn't

52
00:02:53.211 --> 00:02:55.130
know how to make money any other way,

53
00:02:55.310 --> 00:02:59.860
or because they wanted to escape the oppression of their governments because

54
00:03:00.190 --> 00:03:04.060
they were forced into it. None of the above applying to Steve bonus,

55
00:03:04.210 --> 00:03:07.990
he was considered a gentleman of leisure as well. If you had the money,

56
00:03:07.991 --> 00:03:11.410
the influence and the status to live out, all his, he is uncomfort.

57
00:03:11.590 --> 00:03:14.530
But for some reason, this did not appeal to him. Instead,

58
00:03:14.531 --> 00:03:18.700
he preferred to risk his life on the high seas. So why did he do it?

59
00:03:18.820 --> 00:03:21.910
Both his contemporaries and modern historians have offered their opinions.

60
00:03:21.940 --> 00:03:25.690
Some simply believe that he was bored and wanted a bit of excitement in his

61
00:03:25.691 --> 00:03:26.890
life. If this is true,

62
00:03:26.891 --> 00:03:30.280
then Steve Barnett should definitely be in contention for the most extreme

63
00:03:30.880 --> 00:03:32.350
midlife crisis. In history.

64
00:03:32.560 --> 00:03:35.530
Others thought that he suffered from some kind of mental illness. Well,

65
00:03:35.650 --> 00:03:38.110
Charles Johnson in his seminar accounts,

66
00:03:38.111 --> 00:03:42.460
a general history of pirates claimed that bonnet wanted to leave his old life

67
00:03:42.461 --> 00:03:44.440
behind due to some discomfort.

68
00:03:44.590 --> 00:03:48.820
He found in a married state implying that Steve bonnets was doing all of this

69
00:03:48.821 --> 00:03:50.380
just to get away from his wife.

70
00:03:50.470 --> 00:03:53.770
There is also a possibility that his financial situation may not have been as

71
00:03:53.771 --> 00:03:56.230
comfortable as we previously suggested.

72
00:03:56.470 --> 00:04:00.730
As there is a record of him borrowing 1,700 pounds at the start of the year,

73
00:04:00.760 --> 00:04:05.020
maybe a poor harvesting season left him in dire straits and bonnets thought he

74
00:04:05.021 --> 00:04:07.390
had no alternative, but to turn to piracy,

75
00:04:07.391 --> 00:04:11.080
or maybe he'd already made up his mind and knew that it never have to pay the

76
00:04:11.081 --> 00:04:11.914
loan back.

77
00:04:11.950 --> 00:04:16.330
Ultimately all of these hypotheses remain guesswork since Bonner's himself never

78
00:04:16.570 --> 00:04:18.820
gave an explicit reason. Speaking of Charles Johnson,

79
00:04:18.821 --> 00:04:22.750
we often start off these pirate buyers specifying that he is the main source.

80
00:04:22.751 --> 00:04:25.570
And also that is not particularly reliable.

81
00:04:25.571 --> 00:04:28.540
So everything has to be taken with a grain of salt. Well,

82
00:04:28.570 --> 00:04:32.440
that is not necessarily true in this case because although a general history of

83
00:04:32.980 --> 00:04:34.420
pirates remains an important source,

84
00:04:34.720 --> 00:04:38.650
we actually have a more trustworthy secondary one because Steve Bonnett was

85
00:04:38.651 --> 00:04:40.480
arrested and tried for piracy.

86
00:04:40.660 --> 00:04:45.010
A detailed accounts of his trial in South Carolina was published and survives to

87
00:04:45.011 --> 00:04:47.860
this day. So we have corroboration of the things he did as a pilot.

88
00:04:54.630 --> 00:04:58.830
We said in 17, 17, Steve Barnett left his life behind to became a pirate.

89
00:04:59.050 --> 00:05:03.330
Like every other pirate captain bonnet did not steal his ship. He purchased it.

90
00:05:03.360 --> 00:05:07.740
It was a sleep which he named the revenge and had it fitted with 10 cannons.

91
00:05:07.770 --> 00:05:11.460
He also hired his crew around 70 to 80 men who received a monthly salary,

92
00:05:11.640 --> 00:05:13.380
paid out of bonnets own pocket,

93
00:05:13.381 --> 00:05:15.810
instead of simply awarding them a share of the plunder.

94
00:05:15.900 --> 00:05:18.030
This was probably done more out of necessity.

95
00:05:18.120 --> 00:05:22.050
Seeing as alibi recru could depose their captain for being in competence and

96
00:05:22.051 --> 00:05:24.330
then vote on somebody else to take his place.

97
00:05:24.480 --> 00:05:28.030
This was probably the only way that bonnet could have maintained his captaincy,

98
00:05:28.050 --> 00:05:29.820
given that he knew almost nothing.

99
00:05:29.821 --> 00:05:32.820
When it came to sailing navigation or maritime warfare,

100
00:05:32.880 --> 00:05:35.540
once Bonnie has had his ship ready and his crew assembled,

101
00:05:35.670 --> 00:05:37.260
he needed to wait for the right opportunity.

102
00:05:37.500 --> 00:05:40.560
The revenge stayed quietly in the Harbor for a few days.

103
00:05:40.561 --> 00:05:43.500
And everyone who inquired was simply told the bonnet,

104
00:05:43.501 --> 00:05:45.990
purchased it to stop trading with the nearby islands.

105
00:05:46.020 --> 00:05:50.100
Then one night without word to his family or friends that captain abandoned his

106
00:05:50.101 --> 00:05:52.560
life of leisure and set sail on the high seas,

107
00:05:52.710 --> 00:05:55.020
headed for the Eastern coast of North America.

108
00:05:55.110 --> 00:05:59.480
You might think this haphazard approach to would be a recipe for disaster,

109
00:05:59.481 --> 00:06:02.360
but Steve Bonnett was surprisingly successful.

110
00:06:02.450 --> 00:06:05.390
He took his first prizes off the coast of the colony of Virginia,

111
00:06:05.391 --> 00:06:09.560
where he plans it, not one, not two but four ships in a short amount of time,

112
00:06:09.680 --> 00:06:12.470
the AAN, the Tibet, the young and the endeavor.

113
00:06:12.680 --> 00:06:15.010
Two of them sailed out of Scotland's and one out of England.

114
00:06:15.080 --> 00:06:17.120
And those were free to go after being planted.

115
00:06:17.180 --> 00:06:22.100
The turbot however was set to sell from Barbados and Bon is insisted on having

116
00:06:22.101 --> 00:06:23.840
it confiscated and burned down.

117
00:06:24.020 --> 00:06:27.140
He would go on to repeat this with other ships from his native islands.

118
00:06:27.170 --> 00:06:29.960
We're not sure if he did this to try and prevent the word of his actions from

119
00:06:29.961 --> 00:06:33.950
reaching back home, or if the harbored some kind of resentment for Barbados.

120
00:06:34.040 --> 00:06:36.350
Anyway, after Virginia bonnet headed for New York,

121
00:06:36.560 --> 00:06:39.020
he captured another sleep and then resupplied his ship.

122
00:06:39.050 --> 00:06:42.320
According to his trial documents by August 17, 17,

123
00:06:42.470 --> 00:06:46.310
the revenge was already heading back South to the coast of South Carolina.

124
00:06:46.340 --> 00:06:50.420
When he captured two more ships first was a Snoop from Barbados, carrying sugar,

125
00:06:50.960 --> 00:06:53.960
Robinson slaves, and captain by a man named Joseph Palmer.

126
00:06:53.990 --> 00:06:57.680
And the second was a bringing team from new England down to captain Thomas

127
00:06:57.680 --> 00:07:00.230
Porter. Again, bonnet burned down the ship from Barbados.

128
00:07:00.410 --> 00:07:03.710
This initial run proved to be quite successful. Although realistically,

129
00:07:03.711 --> 00:07:07.190
this was more due to the skill and expertise of the crew rather than bonnet

130
00:07:07.191 --> 00:07:08.510
himself. By this point,

131
00:07:08.511 --> 00:07:11.900
most of the pirates probably figured out that the captain was a complete rookie.

132
00:07:11.901 --> 00:07:16.040
When it came to all seafaring matters in some discontented already started

133
00:07:16.070 --> 00:07:16.520
brewing.

134
00:07:16.520 --> 00:07:20.180
It was decided that they would make lands for awhile and go somewhere where they

135
00:07:20.181 --> 00:07:23.630
could actually spend some of that ill gotten gains their vendors, self,

136
00:07:23.631 --> 00:07:25.820
and the sound with The Bahamas, which was a pirate tape.

137
00:07:25.840 --> 00:07:29.660
And at that time that Steve bonnet made the acquaintance of numerous other

138
00:07:29.661 --> 00:07:34.550
Seadogs such as himself and among them was captain Edward teach better known as

139
00:07:34.551 --> 00:07:35.870
the infamous black bit.

140
00:07:41.950 --> 00:07:42.180
<v 1>[Inaudible].</v>

141
00:07:42.180 --> 00:07:42.670
<v 0>Off the bat.</v>

142
00:07:42.670 --> 00:07:45.970
We should mention that from this point on the career's a black bed and bonnet

143
00:07:45.971 --> 00:07:49.090
into twine for a little while, we've already done a video on black bit.

144
00:07:49.091 --> 00:07:52.240
So if you'd like to get more of the story from that perspective,

145
00:07:52.270 --> 00:07:55.600
why not give a little looksy to that video? Anyway,

146
00:07:56.080 --> 00:07:57.670
Baghdad was a skilled and experienced captain,

147
00:07:57.671 --> 00:08:00.550
not to mention that he was respected and feared by screaming.

148
00:08:00.700 --> 00:08:03.100
He was the antithesis of Steed bonnet,

149
00:08:03.101 --> 00:08:07.180
and yet somehow the two struck up a relationship and decided to sail together

150
00:08:07.181 --> 00:08:07.750
for a while.

151
00:08:07.750 --> 00:08:10.810
Many would say that Blackbeard was simply using bonnet to strengthen his own

152
00:08:11.470 --> 00:08:13.030
fleet. And they would probably be right.

153
00:08:13.060 --> 00:08:16.540
This was before Edward teach had gotten his hands on the queen Anne's revenge as

154
00:08:16.750 --> 00:08:18.940
they in flagship for most of his political career.

155
00:08:19.060 --> 00:08:22.450
Having bonnets revenge on his side would have been a significant advantage.

156
00:08:22.480 --> 00:08:25.270
This all worked out well for the captain from Barbados though,

157
00:08:25.271 --> 00:08:28.570
at least at first is having someone like black beds in charge,

158
00:08:28.571 --> 00:08:32.710
probably quelled any desire to leave or revolt that might've been developing

159
00:08:32.711 --> 00:08:33.700
among bonnets group.

160
00:08:33.730 --> 00:08:37.510
So the fleet left in the sour with Steve Bonner's officially a guest aboard

161
00:08:38.050 --> 00:08:38.471
Blackbeard's ship.

162
00:08:38.471 --> 00:08:42.370
While a Lieutenant Richards had been given temporary command of the revenge.

163
00:08:42.400 --> 00:08:46.090
They proved to be a formidable force in the water surrounding The Bahamas and

164
00:08:46.330 --> 00:08:50.500
took at least a dozen prizes on their way to the East coast of America. Again,

165
00:08:50.501 --> 00:08:53.770
going by court records, by the time they reached North Carolina,

166
00:08:53.771 --> 00:08:57.720
they had four ships in their, in between 300 to 400 fighting men.

167
00:08:57.960 --> 00:09:01.080
You always think this would be a good thing for Steve bonnet as he sat out to be

168
00:09:01.110 --> 00:09:01.950
a pirate captain,

169
00:09:01.980 --> 00:09:06.090
not actually knowing anything about what that entails and was now part of one of

170
00:09:06.091 --> 00:09:09.750
the most powerful and feared convoys in American waters. However,

171
00:09:09.751 --> 00:09:11.100
that was not the case. In fact,

172
00:09:11.310 --> 00:09:14.910
Bonnie was quite depressed as he realized what he truly was a prisoner who

173
00:09:15.060 --> 00:09:18.870
willingly gave up command of his ship to his own camp set. Sure. On the surface,

174
00:09:18.871 --> 00:09:22.380
his relationship with teach was still cordial and he wasn't deprived of his

175
00:09:22.381 --> 00:09:23.280
share of the plumber.

176
00:09:23.290 --> 00:09:26.760
But bonnet understood that this would only continue as long as he played the

177
00:09:26.761 --> 00:09:28.590
role of the content guest,

178
00:09:28.710 --> 00:09:31.980
any attempt to reclaim his authority over the revenge would have likely put an

179
00:09:31.981 --> 00:09:34.050
end to all niceties and worst of all bond.

180
00:09:34.110 --> 00:09:36.960
It would have probably discovered that most of his men prefer to sail under

181
00:09:36.961 --> 00:09:38.040
black bed anyway,

182
00:09:38.280 --> 00:09:41.520
and private Bonnie can fester some of the men who were loyal to him that he felt

183
00:09:41.521 --> 00:09:44.820
tired and shameful for his actions. And if possible,

184
00:09:44.821 --> 00:09:48.840
he would have gladly left the pirate life behind and started somewhere fresh and

185
00:09:48.990 --> 00:09:50.710
Spain or Portugal. Let's see,

186
00:09:50.770 --> 00:09:53.490
he could not bear to face a fellow Englishman allows us.

187
00:09:53.491 --> 00:09:57.210
It seems the only way he would regain commands of his ship was back there,

188
00:09:57.240 --> 00:10:00.690
decided to surrender it according to certain versions of the story.

189
00:10:00.691 --> 00:10:02.370
This is exactly what happened.

190
00:10:02.580 --> 00:10:06.260
They say that once Blackbeard captured the Concorde, which he renamed it,

191
00:10:06.261 --> 00:10:07.380
the queen Anne's revenge,

192
00:10:07.530 --> 00:10:11.130
he had no more need for bonnets ship and let him go independent again.

193
00:10:11.250 --> 00:10:13.210
Once this happens, bond it immediately for God.

194
00:10:13.380 --> 00:10:16.470
Any plans about giving up the pirate life and assumed command of the revenge

195
00:10:16.471 --> 00:10:19.440
again, however, his new-found autonomy did not last long.

196
00:10:19.680 --> 00:10:20.910
His inexperience once again,

197
00:10:20.911 --> 00:10:24.030
caused problems with the crew after an ill-fated attempt to plunge array,

198
00:10:24.450 --> 00:10:27.150
well arms merchant names, the Protestant Caesar,

199
00:10:27.360 --> 00:10:31.350
and the waters of Honduras in the spring of 17, 18. Not only did he fail,

200
00:10:31.351 --> 00:10:34.350
but when it was injured in the skirmish, leaving him unfit for duty.

201
00:10:34.440 --> 00:10:36.660
Soon afterwards, he ran into blank bits fleet.

202
00:10:36.661 --> 00:10:40.710
Again that his own men pleaded with the other captain to assume commands of the

203
00:10:40.711 --> 00:10:43.530
revenge once more, which he did. But once again,

204
00:10:43.531 --> 00:10:47.490
found himself Blackbeard's guest slash prisoner, some accounts like that,

205
00:10:47.550 --> 00:10:51.090
of Charles Johnson, like no mention of this brief period of independence.

206
00:10:51.091 --> 00:10:54.360
So whether or not it happens is actually a matter of time.

207
00:10:54.950 --> 00:10:55.783
<v 1>Right?</v>

208
00:11:01.130 --> 00:11:04.610
<v 0>You now have, uh, when Blackbeard's and bonnet severed their ties completely.</v>

209
00:11:04.611 --> 00:11:07.220
And that's just a few months later in may 17,

210
00:11:07.221 --> 00:11:10.910
18 Blackbird used this fleet to blockade the port city of Charleston,

211
00:11:11.030 --> 00:11:14.720
South Carolina, or Charleston, as we call it today. Afterwards,

212
00:11:14.721 --> 00:11:17.900
the ships traveled to Topsail islands off the coast of North Carolina,

213
00:11:17.930 --> 00:11:21.650
which was used as a popular resting and hiding spot for pirates that the queen

214
00:11:21.860 --> 00:11:25.450
ends revenge ran a grounds and became unsalvageable as did one of the smallest

215
00:11:25.700 --> 00:11:27.650
leaps in the fleet with two ships lost black bed,

216
00:11:27.651 --> 00:11:31.460
decided that it might be a good idea to get a pardon from the governor of North

217
00:11:31.460 --> 00:11:33.080
Carolina, a man named Charles Eden,

218
00:11:33.200 --> 00:11:36.920
all pirates were free to do this in an effort to make the waters of the Atlantic

219
00:11:36.921 --> 00:11:37.790
safer King. George.

220
00:11:37.791 --> 00:11:42.140
The first of Britain issued a proclamation for suppressing pirates in the West

221
00:11:42.141 --> 00:11:45.620
Indies, which became known as the King's paws and of 1718.

222
00:11:45.710 --> 00:11:49.220
Basically there was a one-time offer available to any pirates,

223
00:11:49.250 --> 00:11:53.060
no matter how heinous that criminal activities work, as long as they,

224
00:11:53.560 --> 00:11:56.650
before the deadline, not only with the slate be wiped clean,

225
00:11:56.651 --> 00:12:00.490
but they could also receive a commission to become a pirate Hunter and take down

226
00:12:00.491 --> 00:12:04.240
their former Confederates who did not accept the King's pardon back bed and

227
00:12:04.241 --> 00:12:08.170
bonnet traveled to the city of barf and obtained pardons for them and their

228
00:12:08.171 --> 00:12:11.920
crews from governor Eden Blackbird and his men then left on their way.

229
00:12:11.921 --> 00:12:13.570
But bonnet stayed behind for a while,

230
00:12:13.571 --> 00:12:16.270
hoping to get permission to become a private town during the time that he had

231
00:12:16.271 --> 00:12:18.850
been a pirate England's went to war against Spain.

232
00:12:18.880 --> 00:12:22.360
So he thought that he could basically continue where he left off and be on the

233
00:12:22.361 --> 00:12:25.510
right side of the law. By only targeting Spanish merchants.

234
00:12:25.720 --> 00:12:29.230
Eventually Bonnett was told that he could go to the islands of Saint Thomas from

235
00:12:29.440 --> 00:12:31.570
where he could obtain a private tourist commission.

236
00:12:31.750 --> 00:12:33.130
When he finally returned to his ship,

237
00:12:33.160 --> 00:12:35.800
bonnet discovered one last treachery from black bears.

238
00:12:36.070 --> 00:12:39.430
The other pirate captain had stripped to the revenge of all supplies, loot,

239
00:12:39.431 --> 00:12:40.510
and useful materials,

240
00:12:40.660 --> 00:12:44.320
place them aboard the other remaining sloop and took off many scholars.

241
00:12:44.350 --> 00:12:47.620
Now believe that this has been his plan all along and that's he intentionally

242
00:12:47.950 --> 00:12:51.760
wrecks. The queen ends revenge to have an excuse to disband his lodge crew.

243
00:12:51.940 --> 00:12:55.180
As for Steve Bonetti, might've been stranded on top Sal islands,

244
00:12:55.181 --> 00:12:58.150
but at least he was in command of the revenge. Again, furthermore,

245
00:12:58.180 --> 00:12:59.710
his crew hated back there now.

246
00:12:59.711 --> 00:13:02.710
So it was decided once the ship was repaired and see where the, again,

247
00:13:03.020 --> 00:13:06.190
they would go in pursuit of the one who had betrayed them. Once they set off,

248
00:13:06.191 --> 00:13:10.270
they seem noticed a group of 20 or so men Maroons on a nearby sandbar bonnet

249
00:13:10.300 --> 00:13:13.810
rescued them and discovered that they were parts of Blackbeard's crew left

250
00:13:13.811 --> 00:13:17.290
behind because black bear had too many hands on deck for just one ship.

251
00:13:17.440 --> 00:13:20.830
As you might imagine, they also wanted revenge against their former camps in,

252
00:13:20.831 --> 00:13:23.110
and they were glad to join bonnets ranks bond.

253
00:13:23.170 --> 00:13:26.530
It was still much more inexperienced in matters of warfare the black days,

254
00:13:26.710 --> 00:13:28.030
but he had the biggest ship,

255
00:13:28.240 --> 00:13:32.200
the bigger crew and his men were highly motivated by their desire for vengeance.

256
00:13:32.290 --> 00:13:34.720
It would have been an interesting parts of pirate history,

257
00:13:34.810 --> 00:13:36.280
and it's a fitting ends of that chapter.

258
00:13:36.281 --> 00:13:39.760
If the two met up again and engaged in one final battle,

259
00:13:39.850 --> 00:13:42.780
unfortunately this never happens. Bonner's had heard words,

260
00:13:42.800 --> 00:13:46.030
the black dead it's mortars, chipping, and estery called Ocker Koch endless,

261
00:13:46.210 --> 00:13:47.470
but by the time he got there,

262
00:13:47.500 --> 00:13:51.550
he found it empty and never again encountered the treacherous black debt.

263
00:13:58.530 --> 00:14:01.980
There's no longer an option. Bonnet wanted to return to his previous plan,

264
00:14:02.010 --> 00:14:02.640
traveled to St.

265
00:14:02.640 --> 00:14:06.840
Thomas and receive a letter of Mark to become a private arrogant Spain. However,

266
00:14:06.900 --> 00:14:09.840
there was a problem because Blackbeard had stolen all of their supplies.

267
00:14:09.841 --> 00:14:13.740
They needed water, food and liquor, but that posed another problem.

268
00:14:13.770 --> 00:14:17.630
They couldn't just plunder a ship. Technically they weren't pirates anymore.

269
00:14:17.760 --> 00:14:21.150
As they had accepted the King's pardon? This was a one-time deal.

270
00:14:21.151 --> 00:14:24.330
And if they broke it now, there would be no turning back.

271
00:14:24.360 --> 00:14:26.370
They couldn't buy anything either because blank edge,

272
00:14:26.450 --> 00:14:28.590
it also made off with that treasure in the ends,

273
00:14:28.600 --> 00:14:31.920
they encountered a merchant ship full of goods and forced it to trade with them.

274
00:14:32.190 --> 00:14:34.260
And eight off with barrels full of pork and bread.

275
00:14:34.261 --> 00:14:37.980
And instead of left behind a few casks of rice, and it's an old cable,

276
00:14:37.981 --> 00:14:40.140
which was the chain holding the anchor.

277
00:14:40.230 --> 00:14:43.350
They were probably hoping to get away with it on a technicality since they

278
00:14:43.351 --> 00:14:45.600
committed an act of trades, not piracy,

279
00:14:45.840 --> 00:14:50.460
even though it had been basically forced at gunpoint and heavily one sided,

280
00:14:50.520 --> 00:14:53.720
they still didn't have any liquor though, in her pirates, they might as well.

281
00:14:53.721 --> 00:14:57.500
Not about any add to breathe. This is why a couple of days later they plundered,

282
00:14:57.530 --> 00:14:59.300
I mean, traded with another ship,

283
00:14:59.301 --> 00:15:03.380
which provided them with two hogsheads of rum and two of molasses.

284
00:15:04.370 --> 00:15:05.091
It is uncertain.

285
00:15:05.091 --> 00:15:08.630
What bonus plans do give them an exchange because the other ship took advantage

286
00:15:08.631 --> 00:15:11.930
of an opportunity and fled before the transaction was completed.

287
00:15:12.110 --> 00:15:16.070
After this all pretenses were dropped and they became full fledged pirates

288
00:15:16.071 --> 00:15:18.950
again, pardon? Be damned as a precaution though,

289
00:15:19.190 --> 00:15:22.400
Bon it did change his name to captain Thomas and the name of his ship to the

290
00:15:22.670 --> 00:15:25.700
role. James, hoping that maybe this might conceal his identity.

291
00:15:25.970 --> 00:15:27.680
What has spent a short time as captain Thomas,

292
00:15:27.681 --> 00:15:29.330
but it was his most successful time.

293
00:15:29.870 --> 00:15:33.320
Clearly he was no longer the same inexperienced naive man that he was when he

294
00:15:33.321 --> 00:15:36.110
started. It was more respect, it's even a fit.

295
00:15:36.290 --> 00:15:40.130
Some historians claim that Steve bonus was one of the few real pirates to

296
00:15:40.131 --> 00:15:43.580
actually make prisoners walk. The plank is this was a practice,

297
00:15:43.581 --> 00:15:47.630
mostly popularized by the book treasure islands by Robert Louis Stevenson bonnet

298
00:15:47.960 --> 00:15:49.280
proud the waters of the Carolinas.

299
00:15:49.310 --> 00:15:53.840
Traveling up North into Virginia and Delaware capturing almost a dozen ships of

300
00:15:53.841 --> 00:15:56.300
which two. He kept sins added to his fleet.

301
00:16:02.800 --> 00:16:03.130
<v 2>Offer a few.</v>

302
00:16:03.130 --> 00:16:06.400
<v 0>Profitable months. See Bonnie needed a place to make lands.</v>

303
00:16:06.401 --> 00:16:08.710
And Corinne has ship for repairs.

304
00:16:08.770 --> 00:16:12.730
He chose the estery of Cape fear river in North Carolina hurricane season was

305
00:16:12.731 --> 00:16:16.180
approaching. So this was intended to be quite a long state.

306
00:16:16.270 --> 00:16:19.120
Unfortunately for bonus these last few successful months,

307
00:16:19.121 --> 00:16:22.090
it also increased his profile significantly. Charles Eden,

308
00:16:22.091 --> 00:16:23.350
the governor of North Carolina,

309
00:16:23.410 --> 00:16:25.900
might've been somewhat indifferent to pirate activity,

310
00:16:26.110 --> 00:16:29.320
but as neighboring counterparts, not as amenable,

311
00:16:29.380 --> 00:16:32.800
the governance of the colonies knew that they had dangerous pirates in their

312
00:16:32.801 --> 00:16:36.430
waters and wanted them dealt with consequently, the governor of South Carolina,

313
00:16:36.460 --> 00:16:41.050
Robert Johnson ordered a man named Colonel William Rhett to arm to pirate

314
00:16:41.051 --> 00:16:44.110
hunters and set sail to rid the colony of any pirates.

315
00:16:44.170 --> 00:16:47.830
The same thing happens with the governor of Virginia who sent out his own men to

316
00:16:47.831 --> 00:16:50.770
take down black bed. As far as rent is concerned.

317
00:16:50.771 --> 00:16:54.580
We're not sure if he specifically targeted Steve Bonner's or if he intended to

318
00:16:54.581 --> 00:16:55.570
attack any pirates.

319
00:16:55.660 --> 00:16:59.350
He encountered some upsides that he simply stumbled upon bonnets fleet while

320
00:16:59.470 --> 00:17:00.730
looking for Charles vane,

321
00:17:00.731 --> 00:17:04.240
another infamous Piras that you'll likely see on this channel someday,

322
00:17:04.330 --> 00:17:06.610
either way Rhett set out in September 17,

323
00:17:06.611 --> 00:17:11.050
18 in two sleeps the Henry and the scene up and soon received word of several

324
00:17:11.051 --> 00:17:15.280
pirate ships anchored at Cape fear river Colonel rats reached bonnets location.

325
00:17:15.281 --> 00:17:18.550
On the night of September, the 26th, the flight commenced the next morning,

326
00:17:18.730 --> 00:17:22.660
his Banos wanted to sail past the pirate hunters and had the ocean. However,

327
00:17:22.690 --> 00:17:26.050
the river was not wide enough. And during the chaos, both of Rhett's ships,

328
00:17:26.051 --> 00:17:28.720
as well as the roll James were grounded in shallow water.

329
00:17:28.870 --> 00:17:29.950
After hours of fighting,

330
00:17:29.951 --> 00:17:33.910
the South Carolina started to gain the upper hands at one point towards the ends

331
00:17:34.240 --> 00:17:37.510
bonnets allegedly wanted to blow up his ship rather than be captured as,

332
00:17:37.511 --> 00:17:41.680
but he was stopped by his men who decided to surrender ultimately Steed bonus

333
00:17:41.800 --> 00:17:45.640
and 33 of his men survived. The battle were arrested and taken to Charlestown.

334
00:17:45.760 --> 00:17:46.421
As a gentlemen,

335
00:17:46.421 --> 00:17:50.400
bonnet was given preferential treatment and was allowed to in the house of the

336
00:17:50.401 --> 00:17:53.700
provost Marshall on October the 24th, he actually managed to escape,

337
00:17:53.730 --> 00:17:57.060
but was only at large for four days before being captured. Again,

338
00:17:57.150 --> 00:17:59.490
his men didn't have a so good. After 33,

339
00:17:59.491 --> 00:18:02.460
29 were found guilty of piracy and sentenced to death.

340
00:18:02.461 --> 00:18:05.430
And they were all hanged on November the eighth. A few days later,

341
00:18:05.490 --> 00:18:09.720
bonnets trial took place and he too was found guilty and sentenced to die.

342
00:18:09.900 --> 00:18:12.750
His date of execution was scheduled for December the 10th. So,

343
00:18:13.020 --> 00:18:17.460
but it still had some time to try and evade has ghastly fate. He begs,

344
00:18:17.580 --> 00:18:20.190
he argued, he pleaded, he tried blaming black bear.

345
00:18:20.230 --> 00:18:23.910
He wrote letters to anyone who would listen, attempt to get a sentence commuted.

346
00:18:24.180 --> 00:18:25.920
He managed to get in a lot of public sympathy.

347
00:18:25.920 --> 00:18:29.580
And even as capsular Colonel rat was moved to the point that he offered to

348
00:18:29.581 --> 00:18:31.770
travel with Bonnie to England for a new trial.

349
00:18:31.830 --> 00:18:36.720
The gentlemen pirates used as pleas and his tears to move everyone except for

350
00:18:36.721 --> 00:18:40.200
the one person who mattered governor Johnson, despite public pressure,

351
00:18:40.201 --> 00:18:43.980
the governor remained steadfast in his decision arguing that Bonnie had already

352
00:18:43.981 --> 00:18:45.180
broken his word once.

353
00:18:45.210 --> 00:18:48.990
So on December the 10th and almost insensible Steed bonus was dragged to the

354
00:18:48.991 --> 00:18:49.261
gala.

355
00:18:49.261 --> 00:18:53.940
Isn't in front of a crowds that exhibited more pity than contempt or hatred.

356
00:18:54.360 --> 00:18:55.680
He was hanged nowadays.

357
00:18:55.681 --> 00:19:00.540
A historical marker is all the remains of the spot where the notorious gentlemen

358
00:19:00.570 --> 00:19:05.070
pirates and 29 of his men met their end. So I really hope you found that video.
