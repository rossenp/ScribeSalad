below more on them in a bit

6
00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:22.510
For centuries, the British army was not held in very high esteem by the public.

7
00:00:22.730 --> 00:00:27.230
It was notorious for employing the dreads of society. Poor, desperate men,

8
00:00:27.320 --> 00:00:29.190
prone to drunkenness and criminal behavior.

9
00:00:29.450 --> 00:00:33.190
Its officers were almost the exact opposite foist gentlemen who literally bought

10
00:00:33.191 --> 00:00:34.230
their way up the ranks.

11
00:00:34.250 --> 00:00:38.110
It was this army that Britain needed to use to contain the sea seemingly endless

12
00:00:38.111 --> 00:00:41.260
ambitions of the emperor of France, Napoleon bone art,

13
00:00:41.400 --> 00:00:44.060
who crushed countless army sent against him and his marshals.

14
00:00:44.080 --> 00:00:46.420
And he seemed destined to become the master of Europe.

15
00:00:46.520 --> 00:00:47.820
It was at this moment of crisis.

16
00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:51.860
The demand almost singlehandedly changed the course of world history through a

17
00:00:51.861 --> 00:00:52.860
skill on the battlefield.

18
00:00:53.240 --> 00:00:56.220
He took the British army full of fools and rogues as it was,

19
00:00:56.520 --> 00:01:00.740
and honed it into a deadly weapon that defeated every Marshall Napoleon sent

20
00:01:00.741 --> 00:01:01.530
against him.

21
00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:05.730
He helped drive Napoleon office throne was rewarded handsomely by his king with

22
00:01:05.731 --> 00:01:09.770
money and titles. And then incredibly was asked to take down Napoleon again.

23
00:01:09.771 --> 00:01:12.370
When the man escaped from exile and reclaimed his crown,

24
00:01:12.400 --> 00:01:14.930
when the two men finally faced each other on the battlefield,

25
00:01:15.110 --> 00:01:19.090
it set up one of the greatest war stories the world had ever seen.

26
00:01:25.510 --> 00:01:29.240
Initially, Arthur Wellesley did not seem to be a very remarkable man.

27
00:01:29.420 --> 00:01:32.760
He was born on the 1st of May, 1769 in Dublin islands.

28
00:01:32.761 --> 00:01:36.480
He was the second son of an Anglo Irish, no woman, Garrett Wesley,

29
00:01:36.660 --> 00:01:39.280
the Earl of Mornington. He grew up in Irelands though.

30
00:01:39.281 --> 00:01:43.350
The family like most members of the Irish Protestant ability model themselves

31
00:01:43.351 --> 00:01:47.350
after the English Aris Toras they were descended from when Garrett died in 1781.

32
00:01:47.351 --> 00:01:48.151
Arthur's older brother,

33
00:01:48.151 --> 00:01:51.750
Richard inherited his title as well of Mornington along with all the landed

34
00:01:52.230 --> 00:01:54.550
estates, as was often the case with younger sons of nobleman,

35
00:01:54.830 --> 00:01:56.750
it left the question of what to do with Arthur.

36
00:01:56.970 --> 00:01:59.430
He was enrolled at the prestigious eating college in England,

37
00:01:59.431 --> 00:02:02.150
soon after his father's death, he hated it there.

38
00:02:02.151 --> 00:02:05.700
It was very low only for him being so far from his family and the other boys

39
00:02:05.701 --> 00:02:07.420
made fun of him because of his Irish heritage.

40
00:02:07.640 --> 00:02:11.260
He left the school in 1784 and moved to Brussels with his mother who became

41
00:02:11.261 --> 00:02:15.500
worried about him telling friends. I dunno, what I shall do with my awkward son.

42
00:02:15.820 --> 00:02:18.900
Arthur Wellesley's opportunity for advancement came through the British army.

43
00:02:18.901 --> 00:02:23.140
Serving in the military was considered an honorable profession for lesser sons

44
00:02:23.141 --> 00:02:26.050
of the assuming of course, that you had the money for it.

45
00:02:26.110 --> 00:02:29.690
Unlike in the Navy where offices were appointed and promoted based on merit and

46
00:02:29.720 --> 00:02:33.290
seniority in the army, it was standard practice to purchase your commission,

47
00:02:33.291 --> 00:02:35.090
usually for an exorbitant sum of money.

48
00:02:35.091 --> 00:02:38.490
That is the equivalent of tens of thousands of English pounds in today's money.

49
00:02:38.550 --> 00:02:41.570
The purchase system was put in place in the aftermath of the English civil war

50
00:02:41.730 --> 00:02:45.480
and an effort to ensure that commoners like Oliver Cromwell would never be in a

51
00:02:45.600 --> 00:02:48.320
position to leave army against the crown. Again, as a result,

52
00:02:48.380 --> 00:02:51.600
the officer ranks of the British army were almost exclusively filled with

53
00:02:52.120 --> 00:02:54.600
gentlemen, regardless of their actual martial ability.

54
00:02:54.600 --> 00:02:57.800
Wellesley was able to take full advantage of the system along with his

55
00:02:57.801 --> 00:02:58.640
connection to his brother,

56
00:02:58.700 --> 00:03:03.000
the Earl of Mornington to buy his way up the ranks until in 1793,

57
00:03:03.180 --> 00:03:07.320
he was a left tenant kernel attached to the 33rd regimen of foot raised in

58
00:03:07.321 --> 00:03:11.040
Yorkshire. This was as high as he could rise through the purchase system.

59
00:03:11.041 --> 00:03:14.960
Further promotion would have to be secured through merit or seniority as even

60
00:03:14.961 --> 00:03:18.240
the British and ability recognized that allowing untrained officers to literally

61
00:03:18.400 --> 00:03:20.550
buy a command of an army was a bad idea.

62
00:03:20.580 --> 00:03:25.150
Wellesley first got the taste battle in 1794 when the 33rd foot was sent to the

63
00:03:25.151 --> 00:03:27.670
Netherlands to join the army commanded by the duke of York,

64
00:03:27.671 --> 00:03:31.270
attempting to contain the power of France who was attempting to spread the

65
00:03:31.330 --> 00:03:35.350
ideals of the French revolution to all of Europe by force at the battle of Bal

66
00:03:35.351 --> 00:03:39.380
Wellesley and the 33rd acquitted itself, well repelling a French cavalry charge,

67
00:03:39.600 --> 00:03:42.420
but the campaign was a failure for the British plagued by disease and

68
00:03:42.421 --> 00:03:46.020
incompetent leadership. And Wellesley returned to England in 1795

69
00:03:52.400 --> 00:03:53.500
In 1796,

70
00:03:53.501 --> 00:03:57.300
Wellesley newly promoted to Colonel was sent along with the 33rd regimen to

71
00:03:57.310 --> 00:04:00.810
India. One of the most important stronghold of British trade in the world,

72
00:04:00.980 --> 00:04:02.730
India was a complicated place at the time.

73
00:04:02.731 --> 00:04:05.850
British interests were represented by the British east India company,

74
00:04:05.851 --> 00:04:08.170
which started as an ordinary trading corporation,

75
00:04:08.310 --> 00:04:12.330
but by the 1790s had become essentially a law onto itself in India.

76
00:04:12.390 --> 00:04:16.210
The company controlled vast swaths of Indian territory made alliances with

77
00:04:16.610 --> 00:04:20.400
neighboring principalities and raised large armies composed of a mix of Indian

78
00:04:20.401 --> 00:04:24.040
soldiers called sea boys and troops from crate Britain complicating.

79
00:04:24.310 --> 00:04:28.680
This was the machinations of the French who recognizing the importance of India

80
00:04:28.681 --> 00:04:33.000
to British commerce, constantly worked to undermine them in 1798,

81
00:04:33.080 --> 00:04:37.040
a celebrated French general named Napoleon Bonna apart had landed with an army

82
00:04:37.060 --> 00:04:39.400
in Egypt and took control of the Ottoman province,

83
00:04:39.410 --> 00:04:43.190
which would give them our access to the red sea and an ability to directly

84
00:04:43.470 --> 00:04:46.230
threaten British trade in India. Not satisfied with that.

85
00:04:46.231 --> 00:04:50.190
The French made and lions with the powerful Indian kingdom of Mya MEA and it

86
00:04:50.590 --> 00:04:50.730
ruler.

87
00:04:50.730 --> 00:04:55.150
The taboo Salton has long been an enemy over the British Byar at for three wars

88
00:04:55.151 --> 00:04:57.550
already with, and the idea of French army in Egypt,

89
00:04:57.910 --> 00:05:00.190
allying with the Maorian army, scared the British,

90
00:05:00.250 --> 00:05:04.860
who to conquer the saltiness to prevent that from happening Maso are well

91
00:05:04.861 --> 00:05:05.694
trained army,

92
00:05:05.770 --> 00:05:10.380
like many Indian princes had European officers in its ILO to train them in the

93
00:05:10.381 --> 00:05:12.700
modern style of warfare, especially French officers.

94
00:05:12.720 --> 00:05:17.260
In the case of the Tippo Salton, they also had a large store of Maorian rockets,

95
00:05:17.261 --> 00:05:20.100
advanced projectile that could be launched up to two kilometers,

96
00:05:20.280 --> 00:05:23.090
far more advanced anything the British had at the time.

97
00:05:23.190 --> 00:05:27.450
The TBU Salton would be a formidable fo in April, 1799,

98
00:05:27.451 --> 00:05:31.090
the British and their Indian allies invaded by Saul from all sides converging on

99
00:05:31.091 --> 00:05:32.410
the capital centering Al,

100
00:05:32.420 --> 00:05:36.770
which they put under siege in commands of the 33rd regimen and seconded as a

101
00:05:36.850 --> 00:05:38.650
division commander was Colonel Arthur,

102
00:05:38.880 --> 00:05:42.680
Wellesley Wellesley wasn't well liked by the other senior officer who considered

103
00:05:42.681 --> 00:05:46.680
him young and an experienced a product of nepotism since his brother was the

104
00:05:46.720 --> 00:05:47.640
governor general of India.

105
00:05:47.640 --> 00:05:50.840
This was further reinforced when Wellesley suffered to defeat at the hands of

106
00:05:50.841 --> 00:05:51.920
the TBU Salton forces.

107
00:05:52.100 --> 00:05:56.280
During the siege of se AAM sent to attack a small village outside the main

108
00:05:56.281 --> 00:06:00.200
fortres to clear a way for the C artillery Wellesley's men got lost and stumbled

109
00:06:00.230 --> 00:06:05.120
into a Myan trap coming under fire from a storm of musketry and the ever present

110
00:06:05.121 --> 00:06:06.240
rocket explosives,

111
00:06:06.340 --> 00:06:10.160
the men were driven back in confusion with several killed or captured Wellsley

112
00:06:10.161 --> 00:06:11.520
himself was wounded in the knee.

113
00:06:11.680 --> 00:06:14.240
And narrat avoided capture for another officer in his position,

114
00:06:14.300 --> 00:06:16.830
the humiliation by meant the end of his mil career.

115
00:06:16.930 --> 00:06:18.950
But thanks to the patronage of his brother,

116
00:06:19.090 --> 00:06:22.670
he was able to recover and took part in the final storming of the city in may,

117
00:06:22.680 --> 00:06:26.190
which resulted in the capture of the city and the death of the TPU Salton

118
00:06:26.300 --> 00:06:29.230
marking the end of the war Wells. He was named governor Ofer,

119
00:06:29.530 --> 00:06:31.870
AAM and stayed while most of the army withdrew,

120
00:06:31.890 --> 00:06:35.430
but he never forgot the defeat before SAR AAM for the rest of his military

121
00:06:35.431 --> 00:06:39.420
career. He showed an immense, a like for night attacks and seizures in general,

122
00:06:39.600 --> 00:06:42.060
and tried to avoid both wherever possible

123
00:06:48.480 --> 00:06:49.580
At the ends of 1802,

124
00:06:49.581 --> 00:06:52.820
Wellesley was promoted to major general and sent off to war again to the north

125
00:06:52.821 --> 00:06:53.654
of ER,

126
00:06:53.940 --> 00:06:58.610
AAM was the powerful miraa Confederacy controlled by five chief chains that were

127
00:06:58.810 --> 00:07:00.050
constantly squabbling with each other.

128
00:07:00.150 --> 00:07:02.290
The British intervened in one of these power struggles,

129
00:07:02.291 --> 00:07:06.770
taking the side of PUA Barger RA II against the Dallet skin, India,

130
00:07:06.910 --> 00:07:11.850
the RA Barara and triggering the second Anglo miraa war general

131
00:07:11.851 --> 00:07:15.570
Wellsley was put at the head of a mixed army of native Indian sea boys and

132
00:07:15.571 --> 00:07:20.200
British regulars and sent north to destroy Cindy Andar combined armies like the

133
00:07:20.520 --> 00:07:23.920
Tibu Salton skin army was large, but most were poorly trained.

134
00:07:24.120 --> 00:07:27.080
Although it did have some 10,000 troops that were trained and commanded by

135
00:07:27.240 --> 00:07:28.060
European offices.

136
00:07:28.060 --> 00:07:31.800
The army itself was commanded by ans Poman former Sergeant in the British east

137
00:07:31.810 --> 00:07:35.720
India company from the German province of Hanover who had deserted in the 1790s

138
00:07:35.810 --> 00:07:39.110
lured by the lucrative rewards offered by the Indian prince for European

139
00:07:39.111 --> 00:07:39.590
soldiers.

140
00:07:39.590 --> 00:07:43.670
Wellsley split his army in two with the smaller force commanded by Colonel James

141
00:07:43.670 --> 00:07:47.150
Stevenson to try and trap Pullman's army. After over a month of pursuit,

142
00:07:47.151 --> 00:07:50.430
the two received intelligence that their quarry was at Boan.

143
00:07:50.670 --> 00:07:55.470
So 30 miles to the north and planned to combine their forces there on the 24th

144
00:07:55.470 --> 00:07:58.590
of September, 1803 to attack and destroy the Morath army. However,

145
00:07:58.690 --> 00:08:00.300
the day before the plans meet up,

146
00:08:00.360 --> 00:08:04.340
Scouts reported that the Miras had moved and were now in position directly in

147
00:08:04.341 --> 00:08:05.340
front of Wellesley's army,

148
00:08:05.490 --> 00:08:09.900
near the small village of our say Wellesley and command of 4,500

149
00:08:10.060 --> 00:08:14.620
infantry and 5,000 cavalry found himself confronting army of 50,000.

150
00:08:15.000 --> 00:08:17.460
He knew that if he waited for Stevenson to join up with him,

151
00:08:17.461 --> 00:08:18.500
the army would move off.

152
00:08:18.520 --> 00:08:22.170
And the pursuit of would drag on further straining the British supply lines and

153
00:08:22.171 --> 00:08:25.810
possibly drawing the British forces into a disadvantageous position.

154
00:08:26.030 --> 00:08:29.850
The 34 year old general had heard whispers from his colleagues that he was a

155
00:08:29.851 --> 00:08:33.730
product of nepotism too young and had experienced for such an important command

156
00:08:33.950 --> 00:08:36.610
in order to make his reputation. He needed victory.

157
00:08:36.710 --> 00:08:39.490
So he resolved to attack the Miras right there.

158
00:08:39.491 --> 00:08:41.680
And then without waiting for reinforcement,

159
00:08:41.900 --> 00:08:45.000
the idea was not as insane as it might sound. The outset,

160
00:08:45.220 --> 00:08:47.640
the Masa army was large, certainly,

161
00:08:47.660 --> 00:08:51.320
but mostly composed of a regular infantry that Wellesley reasoned wouldn't stand

162
00:08:51.321 --> 00:08:52.200
up under fire.

163
00:08:52.340 --> 00:08:56.520
He had only the European trained infantry to worry about the MOAs were in a

164
00:08:56.521 --> 00:09:00.720
strong defensive position behind the river Kitner covering the only known Ford

165
00:09:00.721 --> 00:09:01.680
in the area. However,

166
00:09:01.681 --> 00:09:05.320
Wellesley spotted twin villages on either side of the Kitna people,

167
00:09:05.680 --> 00:09:09.680
guy on and war, they were small hamlets and didn't even appear on most maps.

168
00:09:09.681 --> 00:09:09.910
However,

169
00:09:09.910 --> 00:09:14.000
Wellesley reasons that the only way two villages would exist on either side of

170
00:09:14.001 --> 00:09:14.834
the river line.

171
00:09:14.910 --> 00:09:18.750
That is if there was a Ford between them Scouts soon confirms the existence of

172
00:09:18.751 --> 00:09:20.790
the Ford and Wellesley decided to cross his army.

173
00:09:21.030 --> 00:09:23.230
There Wellsley initially attempted to flag Pullman's army,

174
00:09:23.330 --> 00:09:26.870
but the German saw what he was doing and swung his army like a Dore hinged,

175
00:09:26.871 --> 00:09:29.630
rotating its 90 degrees to form a new line facing the British.

176
00:09:29.930 --> 00:09:33.230
Now he was Wellesley who was in the strong position as both armies were on a

177
00:09:33.231 --> 00:09:36.220
narrow MOUs between the kit and our rivers,

178
00:09:36.221 --> 00:09:38.540
which favored Wellsey smaller army Wells.

179
00:09:38.620 --> 00:09:41.900
The order is infantry to attack and they started off across the planes towards

180
00:09:41.901 --> 00:09:43.580
the Mora position, as a say,

181
00:09:43.800 --> 00:09:47.100
the Miras had more than a hundred cannons and they laid down a withering fire on

182
00:09:47.101 --> 00:09:48.260
the advancing British troops,

183
00:09:48.580 --> 00:09:51.420
how the British with stood the pounding and maintained their formations,

184
00:09:51.690 --> 00:09:54.380
charged the cannons, capturing them and killing the Gunn.

185
00:09:54.560 --> 00:09:58.450
The right flag of Pullman's line, panicked and fled. And half of the Mora,

186
00:09:58.610 --> 00:10:01.610
the army fled the battlefield before being engaged. Wellsley right.

187
00:10:01.640 --> 00:10:05.410
Flak on the other hand was being hard pressed and Wellsley sent in cabaret to

188
00:10:05.411 --> 00:10:07.250
support them amidst the violence encounter.

189
00:10:07.251 --> 00:10:09.690
It came to Wesley's attention that some of the Mora,

190
00:10:09.850 --> 00:10:13.130
the gunners who had pretended to be dead were now remanding their cans.

191
00:10:13.131 --> 00:10:15.730
The general himself led a cavalry charged to recapture the gun,

192
00:10:16.370 --> 00:10:20.400
being on horse by a sperm and nearly killed in the me Poman had reformed his

193
00:10:20.401 --> 00:10:23.960
infantry, but we Wellsley formed up to attack them. They too broken,

194
00:10:24.100 --> 00:10:25.720
ran giving Wellsley the field,

195
00:10:26.140 --> 00:10:28.920
the battle of say was bloody and proportion to the numbers involved.

196
00:10:29.370 --> 00:10:33.800
Third of Wellesley's army was killed or wounded. And as many as 6,000 MOAs fell,

197
00:10:34.000 --> 00:10:37.710
it was also strategically very important on the outcome of the war is afterwards

198
00:10:37.711 --> 00:10:40.390
many of skin di and Barrar men deserted,

199
00:10:40.391 --> 00:10:43.670
including many of their European officer who accepted an amnesty from the

200
00:10:43.671 --> 00:10:44.590
British east India company.

201
00:10:44.650 --> 00:10:49.110
If they surrendered Wellesley would win two more victories over the Miras at awe

202
00:10:49.210 --> 00:10:52.790
and Garger and skin di and Barara were forced to super peace.

203
00:10:53.010 --> 00:10:56.350
The campaign in India made Wellesley's career for the rest of his life.

204
00:10:56.351 --> 00:10:57.820
He would mean to that.

205
00:10:57.980 --> 00:11:01.580
A say was his greatest victory Napoleon on the other hand would refer to

206
00:11:01.581 --> 00:11:05.700
Wellesley as the CPO general implying that his reputation was inflated by a

207
00:11:05.701 --> 00:11:07.860
series of victories over minor opponents,

208
00:11:07.861 --> 00:11:11.460
Wellesley would soon have a chance to prove the newly crowned French ER wrong.

209
00:11:12.100 --> 00:11:13.860
And what a tease that was,

210
00:11:14.180 --> 00:11:17.770
we're going to escalate the conflict between Napoleon and Wellesley, just it.

211
00:11:17.771 --> 00:11:21.290

239
00:12:45.960 --> 00:12:48.020
By 1805. Wellesley was tired of India.

240
00:12:48.340 --> 00:12:51.380
It spent seven years there and was ready to go home. It requested a transfer.

241
00:12:51.640 --> 00:12:55.290
And when his brothers tour is governor Jim of India ended the two return to

242
00:12:55.291 --> 00:12:57.970
England on board, the same ship for the next three years,

243
00:12:57.971 --> 00:13:02.370
Wellesley dabbled in politics while also participating in military adventures in

244
00:13:02.371 --> 00:13:06.890
Russia and Denmark raised to left tenant general in 80 0 80 was Puting commands

245
00:13:06.891 --> 00:13:10.330
of an expeditionary force of 9,000 men that was supposed to attack Spanish

246
00:13:10.331 --> 00:13:12.450
colonies in south America. But at the last minutes,

247
00:13:12.670 --> 00:13:16.000
his force was diverted to Portugal little. Did he realize it at the time?

248
00:13:16.060 --> 00:13:20.680
But events had just been set in motion that were consumed Wellesley's life for

249
00:13:20.681 --> 00:13:25.600
the next seven years and turn him into a national hero in 1808 Napoleon

250
00:13:25.920 --> 00:13:29.280
Bonna apart was master of Europe. The French Emper had decisively defeated,

251
00:13:29.310 --> 00:13:32.720
both the Austrians and the Prussians had controlled all of Ursula, Italy,

252
00:13:32.721 --> 00:13:35.550
and much of Germany and had just did a treaty with Russia.

253
00:13:35.770 --> 00:13:37.870
His only real opposition left came from great Britain.

254
00:13:38.130 --> 00:13:41.670
The two countries were in an awkward stale made because while Britain couldn't

255
00:13:41.671 --> 00:13:43.550
hope to match Napoleon's powerful army,

256
00:13:43.740 --> 00:13:47.070
neither could France Mount any effective opposition to the British Navy,

257
00:13:47.080 --> 00:13:49.590
which was the undisputed master of the seas.

258
00:13:49.610 --> 00:13:53.470
The cream of the French Naval fleet had been destroyed in the battle of trau in

259
00:13:53.471 --> 00:13:56.860
October of 1805. And with no way to counter the British Navy,

260
00:13:56.900 --> 00:13:58.700
Napoleon was unable to invade Britain,

261
00:13:59.260 --> 00:14:01.500
standing his army on the wrong side of the English channel.

262
00:14:01.620 --> 00:14:03.980
Napoleon tried to undermine the British by again,

263
00:14:03.981 --> 00:14:08.300
attacking their commercial interests just as it attempt to do an Egypt 10 years

264
00:14:08.301 --> 00:14:11.260
earlier this time Napoleon devised the continental system,

265
00:14:11.261 --> 00:14:15.810
which tried to block trade between Britain and the countries of mainland Europe.

266
00:14:15.910 --> 00:14:19.530
He enforced this system at bare net point threatening to invade any country that

267
00:14:19.531 --> 00:14:20.770
didn't comply his threats.

268
00:14:20.770 --> 00:14:24.090
They didn't impress the country of Portugal located on the Western edge of the

269
00:14:24.091 --> 00:14:25.010
Iberian peninsula.

270
00:14:25.090 --> 00:14:28.650
Portugal was one of great Britain's oldest and longest standing allies and the

271
00:14:28.651 --> 00:14:31.330
country's economy depended heavily on foreign trade. Further.

272
00:14:31.370 --> 00:14:34.330
Portugal was separated from France by the country of Spain,

273
00:14:34.340 --> 00:14:35.850
which while France's all,

274
00:14:36.080 --> 00:14:39.240
didn't seem likely to permit French troops to March all the way across their

275
00:14:39.241 --> 00:14:40.720
country to get to Portugal. Finally,

276
00:14:41.200 --> 00:14:45.160
Greg Britain promised to defend Portugal if it was attacked Napoleon. However,

277
00:14:45.260 --> 00:14:49.200
in his usual spectacular fashion turns on his ally and invaded Spain posing the

278
00:14:49.201 --> 00:14:52.400
government in Madrid and placing his brother Joseph on the Spanish throne.

279
00:14:52.540 --> 00:14:53.960
He also occupied Portugal,

280
00:14:53.961 --> 00:14:57.000
forcing the Portuguese Royal family to flee into exile and Brazil,

281
00:14:57.200 --> 00:14:58.200
B Britain intervened.

282
00:14:58.201 --> 00:15:01.640
And Wellsley was the first general to arrive in Portugal with a combined British

283
00:15:01.840 --> 00:15:02.481
and Portuguese army.

284
00:15:02.481 --> 00:15:07.400
He defeated the forces of French general Jean and doo at the battle of RAA and

285
00:15:07.660 --> 00:15:10.120
the in August of 1808. However,

286
00:15:10.510 --> 00:15:14.030
yearly after the two battles Wellsley found himself superseded in commands by

287
00:15:14.031 --> 00:15:15.710
the governor of Gibraltar general,

288
00:15:16.190 --> 00:15:20.190
Hugh Rimple Darri undermined everything Wellsley had done by signing an

289
00:15:20.550 --> 00:15:21.910
agreements with general, as you know,

290
00:15:22.090 --> 00:15:26.430
the convention of Citra that stipulated that the French army would be evacuated

291
00:15:26.431 --> 00:15:29.830
from Portugal on board, British ships, complete with all their arms,

292
00:15:30.350 --> 00:15:33.220
their cannons, and even the booty that they'd stolen from the Portuguese.

293
00:15:33.221 --> 00:15:34.054
During the invasion,

294
00:15:34.200 --> 00:15:37.900
the convention of Centra caused outrage in gray Britain and both Dar imple and

295
00:15:37.901 --> 00:15:40.420
Wellesley were recalled to face court of inquiry over the whole affair.

296
00:15:40.421 --> 00:15:40.861
Meanwhile,

297
00:15:40.861 --> 00:15:44.820
Napoleon invaded the Iberian peninsula himself at the head of his grand army

298
00:15:44.950 --> 00:15:49.060
decisively defeating the British at Karu in January, 1809,

299
00:15:49.061 --> 00:15:51.100
killing the British commander, sir, John Moore,

300
00:15:51.160 --> 00:15:55.170
the pro depo was blamed for the entire affair and would never hold a field

301
00:15:55.171 --> 00:15:55.771
command again.

302
00:15:55.771 --> 00:15:59.770
Wellesley who had vehemently opposed the agreement his superior had made was

303
00:15:59.771 --> 00:16:02.730
cleared of all wrongdoing at a loss for what to do next,

304
00:16:02.750 --> 00:16:07.010
the British secretary of war or castle Ray received a memo from Wellesley that

305
00:16:07.011 --> 00:16:10.290
stated that he believed the Portugal was still an ideal place for Britain to

306
00:16:10.291 --> 00:16:11.650
carry on the war against the French.

307
00:16:12.640 --> 00:16:15.920
Elizabeth should be their base of operations because it could be protected by

308
00:16:15.921 --> 00:16:20.680
the raw Navy castle. Ray agreed and sent Wellesley back to Portugal in April,

309
00:16:20.680 --> 00:16:24.680
1809. This time in command of all British forces in theater position,

310
00:16:24.940 --> 00:16:26.360
who would hold for the rest of the war.

311
00:16:32.550 --> 00:16:36.230
Wellesley immediately went on the offensive Portugal had named him commander in

312
00:16:36.390 --> 00:16:38.350
chief of their army, as well as the British one.

313
00:16:38.410 --> 00:16:41.150
And he quickly combined them together into one integrated army,

314
00:16:41.260 --> 00:16:42.710
less than a month after his arrival,

315
00:16:42.850 --> 00:16:46.870
he led his new army north from Lisbon and routed martial genres,

316
00:16:46.871 --> 00:16:51.710
a due SOS army at Porto liberating Portugal, second city SOS, army escaped,

317
00:16:51.730 --> 00:16:55.420
but had to abandon an their artillery baggage in the process with Portugal

318
00:16:55.421 --> 00:16:58.380
clears Wellesley advanced into Spain and linked up with the Spanish army

319
00:16:58.381 --> 00:17:03.260
commanded by general Gregoria Questa Questa proved a rather ineffectual ally.

320
00:17:03.261 --> 00:17:06.700
However, he routinely promised supplies the British and didn't provide them.

321
00:17:06.701 --> 00:17:09.820
And he arrogantly believed that he knew more about military strategy than

322
00:17:10.300 --> 00:17:12.420
everyone around him, including Wellesley, but at the same time,

323
00:17:12.520 --> 00:17:15.090
his army was poorly to trained at one point during the campaign,

324
00:17:15.150 --> 00:17:18.890
as well as the other Anglo Portuguese offices watched the entire battle line of

325
00:17:18.891 --> 00:17:23.770
Spanish soldiers fired a Coffs VO at a small group of French Scouts who were out

326
00:17:23.930 --> 00:17:27.810
of range causing no damage terrified by the noise of their own VO foreign entire

327
00:17:28.250 --> 00:17:32.090
battalions of Spanish soldiers. Over 2000 men fled the field in a panic looting,

328
00:17:32.091 --> 00:17:36.200
the British baggage train on their way out next day, the 28th of July,

329
00:17:36.200 --> 00:17:40.160
1809 Wellesley faced off against the French Marshall George on at the battle oft

330
00:17:40.250 --> 00:17:42.680
Avera. This was far larger in scale than any battle.

331
00:17:42.681 --> 00:17:47.080
Wellesley had fought before he commanded Anar of 55,000 British Portuguese and

332
00:17:47.081 --> 00:17:51.040
Spanish troops against 46,000 French Wellesley held his grounds while Jordan

333
00:17:51.240 --> 00:17:53.400
Donald sent his army forward in three great columns.

334
00:17:53.480 --> 00:17:57.120
A tactic Napoleon had perfected over the years as being able to smash through

335
00:17:57.121 --> 00:17:58.760
enemy formations like a hammer blow,

336
00:17:58.761 --> 00:18:02.400
but Wellesley who had studied Napoleons battles extensively showed off for the

337
00:18:02.401 --> 00:18:04.680
first time has countered the attacking columns,

338
00:18:04.681 --> 00:18:07.120
putting his troops in a defensive position on a hill,

339
00:18:07.121 --> 00:18:11.550
arranging them in two deep firing lines and taking advantage of superior British

340
00:18:12.270 --> 00:18:12.551
mare training,

341
00:18:12.551 --> 00:18:16.830
concentrating in almost continuous VO of fire onto the approaching columns until

342
00:18:16.831 --> 00:18:20.230
the French panicked and retreated. This is what happens Attel Avera.

343
00:18:20.330 --> 00:18:24.670
And at the end of a bloody day of fighting that saw 15,000 combined casualties

344
00:18:24.910 --> 00:18:26.390
Wellsley was in command of the field.

345
00:18:26.570 --> 00:18:30.300
The victory of Tel Avera was celebrated all over and Wellsley was raised the

346
00:18:30.301 --> 00:18:33.660
British pur named the VI count, Wellington oft Avera,

347
00:18:33.760 --> 00:18:37.700
but Wellington as he was now known good didn't afford to rest on his laurels.

348
00:18:37.701 --> 00:18:40.340
Soon after his victory, he was forced to retreat into Portugal.

349
00:18:40.341 --> 00:18:43.940
The supply situation to become untenable as Wellington Spanish allies failed in

350
00:18:43.941 --> 00:18:44.360
completely.

351
00:18:44.360 --> 00:18:47.860
He was incensed to discover that not only had quest a refused to help him defend

352
00:18:47.861 --> 00:18:50.570
Portugal against another incursion by Marshall. So,

353
00:18:50.670 --> 00:18:53.690
but the Quester had also abandoned 1,500 wounded,

354
00:18:53.691 --> 00:18:57.330
British soldiers left in his care and they were captured by the French 18,

355
00:18:57.331 --> 00:19:00.890
10 saw Wellington under threat from a massive new French army commanded by

356
00:19:01.010 --> 00:19:04.970
Marshall Andre Messina Messina was one of Napoleon's most celebrated Marshalls

357
00:19:04.990 --> 00:19:08.170
and had been given orders by the Emper to sweep. The British out of Portugal.

358
00:19:08.171 --> 00:19:11.200
Wellington was forced to retreat performance seen as forces though.

359
00:19:11.600 --> 00:19:15.720
He was able to briefly check the marshals advance at the battle of Barco.

360
00:19:15.780 --> 00:19:19.400
On the 27th of September British opinion of the army was low.

361
00:19:19.600 --> 00:19:22.800
And there was speculation that the whole Portuguese adventure would have to be

362
00:19:22.801 --> 00:19:24.720
called off, but Wellington wasn't beaten yet.

363
00:19:25.160 --> 00:19:28.200
Messina arrived at Torres verres in October of 1810,

364
00:19:28.960 --> 00:19:31.430
discover that his army had run a literal wall.

365
00:19:31.650 --> 00:19:35.470
The British houses in complete secrecy constructed an elaborate line of forts

366
00:19:35.471 --> 00:19:36.910
and red doubts that chain together,

367
00:19:36.970 --> 00:19:40.030
the mountains across the entirety of the Libon peninsula,

368
00:19:40.250 --> 00:19:44.670
the lines of Taveras had an effective communication system and interior lines

369
00:19:44.850 --> 00:19:48.790
all along it to rushed defenders to any threats portion that the Portuguese had

370
00:19:48.791 --> 00:19:53.100
adopted a scorched death policy before the law removing or destroying any food

371
00:19:53.101 --> 00:19:55.300
fodder or shelter for miles evacuating,

372
00:19:55.340 --> 00:19:58.300
a quarter of a million civilians to positions behind the lines.

373
00:19:58.900 --> 00:20:02.260
Messina was completely baffled and found himself stuck in a position as winter

374
00:20:02.580 --> 00:20:06.100
set in when Messina finally retreated back into Spain in March, 1811,

375
00:20:06.101 --> 00:20:09.140
he had lost 21,000 men to starvation and the elements,

376
00:20:09.240 --> 00:20:13.210
the lines of Tara vs marked the high to mark of the French advance while

377
00:20:13.211 --> 00:20:16.410
Wellington's army emerged from behind them in the spring of 1811.

378
00:20:16.830 --> 00:20:18.010
And they never used them again.

379
00:20:24.640 --> 00:20:27.490
When Wellington emerged from behind the lines of Torres Vare,

380
00:20:27.550 --> 00:20:31.810
he did so at the head of an army that was beginning to be honed into a powerful

381
00:20:32.080 --> 00:20:35.240
weapon. The average British soldier came from a very poor backgrounds,

382
00:20:35.560 --> 00:20:38.640
many had criminal records and were given a choice between joining the army or

383
00:20:38.641 --> 00:20:39.300
going to prison.

384
00:20:39.300 --> 00:20:43.440
Others joined because the only alternative was starving Wellington.

385
00:20:43.441 --> 00:20:46.760
Like most of the upper class considered these men to be rogues prone,

386
00:20:46.761 --> 00:20:50.720
to drunkenness and Buty and thus needed to be disciplined harshly. However,

387
00:20:50.721 --> 00:20:54.120
Wellington also respected their ability as soldiers and praised them for

388
00:20:54.240 --> 00:20:55.010
fighting well. In battle,

389
00:20:55.010 --> 00:20:57.600
Wellington found himself at the head of a multinational army,

390
00:20:57.601 --> 00:21:00.800
eventually consisting of British Portuguese and Spanish soldiers.

391
00:21:00.860 --> 00:21:04.840
In addition to troops from the German province of Hanover who forms the King's

392
00:21:04.841 --> 00:21:05.540
German Legion,

393
00:21:05.540 --> 00:21:09.750
his ability to the complications of this coalition force was just as important

394
00:21:09.850 --> 00:21:13.590
as his tactical skill on the battlefield equally important was his conviction

395
00:21:13.591 --> 00:21:16.390
not to throw away the lives of his soldiers. Needlessly.

396
00:21:16.391 --> 00:21:20.910
He excelled as defensive general able to pick his grounds and force the enemy to

397
00:21:20.911 --> 00:21:24.070
attack him in 1811, after chasing the French army outta Portugal,

398
00:21:24.071 --> 00:21:28.140
Wellington laid siege to the strategic border of fortres AAL mare.

399
00:21:28.160 --> 00:21:31.820
The first of three strongholds he needed to capture in order to secure his

400
00:21:32.020 --> 00:21:35.180
invasion route into Spain, he took our mare in May,

401
00:21:35.180 --> 00:21:38.460
1811 after the French abandoned it with most of the Garrison able to avoid

402
00:21:38.461 --> 00:21:40.460
capture much to Wellington's anger.

403
00:21:40.720 --> 00:21:43.460
He then took the French by surprise in January 18, 12,

404
00:21:43.620 --> 00:21:47.460
the advancing through a snowstorm, a SGE suit and capture the second four.

405
00:21:48.130 --> 00:21:51.410
See dad Rodrigo before the French had a chance to send a relief force.

406
00:21:51.670 --> 00:21:55.570
Now Wellington went south knowing he had to capture the third fortres to secure

407
00:21:55.590 --> 00:21:58.850
his line of communication and supply into Spain. Unfortunately,

408
00:21:59.650 --> 00:22:02.770
badass was the most difficult of the three to take it boasted,

409
00:22:02.810 --> 00:22:06.610
a modern woo bristling with cannons and manned by Garrison of 5,000 French

410
00:22:06.611 --> 00:22:10.120
soldiers. Wellington's army at the city under siege in March 18, 12,

411
00:22:10.180 --> 00:22:13.400
and made three breaches in the walls. On the night of April, the sixth,

412
00:22:13.401 --> 00:22:16.840
Wellington ordered his troops to assault batter, aha, and attack the breaches.

413
00:22:16.841 --> 00:22:18.280
Since the French knew they were coming,

414
00:22:18.430 --> 00:22:21.920
they had prepared all sorts of nasty surprises for the British salt troops,

415
00:22:21.921 --> 00:22:24.920
including mines, ditches, sharpened steaks. And of course,

416
00:22:24.921 --> 00:22:26.480
plenty of cannons and masks.

417
00:22:26.660 --> 00:22:30.430
The storming of badass was a Val of fair are compounded by the small space in

418
00:22:30.431 --> 00:22:31.310
which the battle was fought.

419
00:22:31.610 --> 00:22:35.230
Two hours of attacks had produced nothing but carnage for the British until two

420
00:22:35.231 --> 00:22:38.510
attacks with ladders on the flanks of the fortres that were only supposed to be

421
00:22:38.511 --> 00:22:43.070
diversions unexpectedly succeeded in entering the city and capturing the

422
00:22:43.071 --> 00:22:44.710
breaches from behind the victorious.

423
00:22:44.711 --> 00:22:48.350
British ran wild through the city raping and killing Spanish civilians and

424
00:22:48.420 --> 00:22:49.780
fleeing soldiers,

425
00:22:49.781 --> 00:22:54.180
looting and burning homes and violence and destruction that wouldn't be fully

426
00:22:54.181 --> 00:22:55.620
stopped for three days,

427
00:22:55.860 --> 00:22:58.940
daybreak on April the seventh revealed why the soldiers had been so blood

428
00:22:58.941 --> 00:22:59.400
thirsty,

429
00:22:59.400 --> 00:23:02.900
the sight of the breaches was filled with bodies stacked on top of each other,

430
00:23:02.901 --> 00:23:07.500
like firewood blood soaked the grounds and ran in the ditches like streams over

431
00:23:07.560 --> 00:23:11.650
2000 British soldiers laid dead or are dying in the relatively small space part

432
00:23:11.651 --> 00:23:15.450
of 4,800 total casualties sustained during the assault.

433
00:23:15.590 --> 00:23:19.050
The normally composed Wellington broke down and wept when he viewed the carnage.

434
00:23:19.190 --> 00:23:22.850
But despite the high cost, Wellington now had the keys to Spain in his pocket,

435
00:23:23.030 --> 00:23:26.930
and he intended to use them to push the French out Spain once. And for all

436
00:23:33.170 --> 00:23:36.640
After capturing battle, HTH Wellington intended to advance into Spain,

437
00:23:36.780 --> 00:23:40.680
but first he needed to deal with the French army bonded by Marshall orga Moore

438
00:23:40.780 --> 00:23:43.880
who had replaced Macina after months of maneuvers.

439
00:23:44.080 --> 00:23:47.400
The two armies met at Salman on the 22nd of July.

440
00:23:47.401 --> 00:23:50.160
Both armies were roughly the same size about 50,000,

441
00:23:50.420 --> 00:23:54.720
but Wellington took advantage of a mistaken positioning by Mar mourns caught the

442
00:23:54.721 --> 00:23:57.480
French by surprise inflicting a decisive defeat on them.

443
00:23:57.800 --> 00:24:00.200
14,000 casualties to the allies 5,000.

444
00:24:00.460 --> 00:24:03.800
It was said that Wellington had defeated an army of 40,000 in 14 minutes.

445
00:24:03.940 --> 00:24:06.830
The victory forced the French out of the Spanish capital Madrid,

446
00:24:06.831 --> 00:24:08.430
which was occupied by the allies.

447
00:24:08.570 --> 00:24:12.270
It also convinced the Spanish who had been mistrustful of their allies to make

448
00:24:12.271 --> 00:24:15.670
Wellington commander of all their armies, the general emo,

449
00:24:15.690 --> 00:24:19.390
but Wellington wasn't able to capture the strategic fortres of Baras despite

450
00:24:19.630 --> 00:24:22.230
laying siege to it. And when the French armies of Mar Moore,

451
00:24:22.670 --> 00:24:24.190
so combined together to one force,

452
00:24:24.200 --> 00:24:27.100
Wellington was compelled to retreat again towards Portugal.

453
00:24:27.200 --> 00:24:30.980
By the time the campaign of 1813 began the strategic picture of the entire war

454
00:24:30.981 --> 00:24:34.860
changed Napoleon's invasion of Russia. The year before it ended in disaster,

455
00:24:34.970 --> 00:24:37.340
when his grand arm it was virtually destroyed,

456
00:24:37.360 --> 00:24:41.100
the defeat prompted the previously defeated countries of Austria and Russia to

457
00:24:41.101 --> 00:24:44.380
rise up against Napoleon. Again, joining together with Russia, Sweden,

458
00:24:44.700 --> 00:24:48.450
and the allied C fighting in Spain and a new coalition against the French,

459
00:24:48.580 --> 00:24:51.490
there would be no more reinforcement sent to Iberia. In fact,

460
00:24:51.550 --> 00:24:55.450
the emperor started moving troops out of Spain to reinforce his increasingly

461
00:24:55.770 --> 00:24:57.770
pressed armies in Germany. Wellington on the other hand,

462
00:24:58.130 --> 00:25:02.170
had a reinforced and well organized army of 120,000 British Spanish and

463
00:25:02.171 --> 00:25:05.650
Portuguese soldiers with it. He attacked not east as he did in 1812,

464
00:25:05.970 --> 00:25:09.960
but at north towards the Spanish city of San tanera report city on the bay of

465
00:25:10.360 --> 00:25:13.320
bisque only then did he advance east not to meet the French army,

466
00:25:13.420 --> 00:25:16.720
but to attempt to cut it off from France, the French army retreated,

467
00:25:16.721 --> 00:25:20.000
abandoning central Spain, trying to avoid being out flagged.

468
00:25:20.060 --> 00:25:23.960
It was nominally headed by king Joseph Bonna apart though he left operational

469
00:25:23.961 --> 00:25:25.400
control to his marshals,

470
00:25:25.401 --> 00:25:28.790
but the King's presence meant that the army carried with not only equipment

471
00:25:28.791 --> 00:25:29.624
needed to make war,

472
00:25:29.690 --> 00:25:32.630
but also all the treasure that the French should have masked since their

473
00:25:32.870 --> 00:25:36.190
invasion, perhaps as much as a hundred million in today's money.

474
00:25:36.200 --> 00:25:40.670
Wellington caught up with a French shout Victoria on the 21st of June 18, 13,

475
00:25:40.910 --> 00:25:43.190
and the battle that followed the French army was completely routed.

476
00:25:43.290 --> 00:25:45.830
It suffered 8,000 killed wounded or captured,

477
00:25:45.831 --> 00:25:47.540
and the rest fled the field in panic,

478
00:25:47.550 --> 00:25:50.700
abandoning over 150 artillery pieces to the enemy.

479
00:25:50.701 --> 00:25:52.660
French casualties might have been worse,

480
00:25:52.680 --> 00:25:56.180
but the victorious British troop stopped pursuing the fleeing French in order to

481
00:25:56.620 --> 00:25:58.700
loot the baggage train, which had also been abandoned.

482
00:25:58.701 --> 00:26:00.140
Wellington continued to push.

483
00:26:00.200 --> 00:26:04.460
And by the end of the year had thrown the French outta Spain entirely and had

484
00:26:04.461 --> 00:26:07.970
invaded Southern France. He had just captured the city of to lose.

485
00:26:08.000 --> 00:26:10.650
When word came in on the 12th of April 18, 14,

486
00:26:10.651 --> 00:26:14.970
that Napoleon has positioned untenable as the combined Russian Austrian

487
00:26:15.410 --> 00:26:18.530
impression armies captured Paris had abdicated and the war was over.

488
00:26:18.750 --> 00:26:23.210
The news prompted the austere Wellington to break out into an impromptu flamenco

489
00:26:23.211 --> 00:26:24.044
dance

490
00:26:30.020 --> 00:26:31.840
As is victories mounted in Spain,

491
00:26:31.841 --> 00:26:35.680
Wellington was rewarded with increasingly prestigious titles of nobility first

492
00:26:36.000 --> 00:26:39.720
VI count. Then I then marque. And finally on the 3rd of May 18, 14,

493
00:26:39.820 --> 00:26:41.920
he was created as the first duke of Wellington.

494
00:26:42.020 --> 00:26:44.760
He was also promoted to the Army's highest rank field Marshall,

495
00:26:44.980 --> 00:26:46.920
the only one in active army service.

496
00:26:47.140 --> 00:26:49.480
He was also hailed as a conquering hero in Britain.

497
00:26:49.660 --> 00:26:52.200
The most successful British general, since the duke of Marlborough,

498
00:26:52.201 --> 00:26:53.120
some hundred years earlier,

499
00:26:53.260 --> 00:26:56.520
the prime minister wanted to send him to north America to beat the United States

500
00:26:56.720 --> 00:26:59.320
in the war of 18, 12, but Wellington felt he was needed more in Europe.

501
00:26:59.470 --> 00:27:02.240
Instead he was named the British ambassador to the Congress,

502
00:27:02.750 --> 00:27:06.430
Vienna convenes to carve up Europe in the post Napoleon world.

503
00:27:06.440 --> 00:27:09.350
Everything changed on the 26th of February,

504
00:27:09.350 --> 00:27:13.510
1815 when Napoleon exile to the island of El and the Mediterranean sea escaped

505
00:27:13.511 --> 00:27:14.390
and returned to France,

506
00:27:14.570 --> 00:27:18.110
the restored French monarchy crumbled under the onslaught of renewed sport for

507
00:27:18.111 --> 00:27:21.110
Napoleon and by may had regained control of the country.

508
00:27:21.330 --> 00:27:24.020
The Congress of Vienna declared nap in an out Laurens,

509
00:27:24.120 --> 00:27:26.460
all the major powers of Europe resolved to once again,

510
00:27:26.461 --> 00:27:30.420
put their armies in the fields to remove him from power Wellington pointed to

511
00:27:30.421 --> 00:27:31.254
command British forces,

512
00:27:31.330 --> 00:27:34.540
left Vienna for the Netherlands where British troops were being combined with

513
00:27:34.590 --> 00:27:37.860
Dutch and small German state forces into an allied army that would fight

514
00:27:37.861 --> 00:27:41.300
alongside a Prussian army commanded by general Gahar Vaughn blue shot.

515
00:27:41.301 --> 00:27:45.050
They were planning to wait there until July when the Russian and Austrian armies

516
00:27:45.051 --> 00:27:46.250
would join them mans.

517
00:27:46.251 --> 00:27:50.770
They would all invade France together as an overwhelming force Napoleon figuring

518
00:27:50.771 --> 00:27:53.570
that if he defeated both the British and the PR armies in turn,

519
00:27:53.571 --> 00:27:57.090
he could force the coalition to the negotiating table marched. First,

520
00:27:57.310 --> 00:28:00.250
he invaded the Netherlands on the 15th of June catching Wellington,

521
00:28:00.251 --> 00:28:03.970
and luha by surprise. The first part of the Napoleons plan worked well. He put,

522
00:28:04.040 --> 00:28:08.160
prevented the two armies from combining together and beat the Prussians at the

523
00:28:08.161 --> 00:28:11.440
battle of Ligne on the 16th of June, forcing them to retreat,

524
00:28:11.441 --> 00:28:13.240
believing the Prussians to be outta the fight.

525
00:28:13.440 --> 00:28:16.880
And Napoleon now turned on Wellington who moved his army to a position he

526
00:28:16.881 --> 00:28:18.720
believed he could defend Ridge line,

527
00:28:18.721 --> 00:28:21.840
just south of the Belgian town of Waterloo on the 18th of June,

528
00:28:21.900 --> 00:28:25.470
the two armies faced off against each other in one of the its battles ever

529
00:28:25.471 --> 00:28:26.710
fought on European soil.

530
00:28:26.770 --> 00:28:29.470
If you're onto a detailed play byplay of the battle of water that you should

531
00:28:29.471 --> 00:28:33.910
absolutely check out our video on our sister channel geographics all about it.

532
00:28:34.010 --> 00:28:38.230
The sure version is that it was gargantuan in scale involving more than 200,000

533
00:28:38.270 --> 00:28:39.870
soldiers by the days ends.

534
00:28:40.170 --> 00:28:43.710
And it was bloody 65,000 were dead wounded or missing.

535
00:28:44.070 --> 00:28:47.900
Napoleon had two key mistakes at Waterloo that would prove to be his undoing.

536
00:28:47.901 --> 00:28:49.580
First, he had underestimated Wellington,

537
00:28:49.610 --> 00:28:53.820
despite being warned about him by his marshals who had fought and been beaten by

538
00:28:53.821 --> 00:28:57.700
him. The emperor dismissed him as an opponent, unworthy of respect,

539
00:28:57.880 --> 00:29:00.700
the CPO general, who fought sitting on his.

540
00:29:01.200 --> 00:29:04.020
He believed that he could be easily swept aside seconds.

541
00:29:04.080 --> 00:29:06.210
The Prussians hadn't retreated by mid afternoon.

542
00:29:06.211 --> 00:29:09.250
They had appeared on the battlefield at Waterloo catching the French in the

543
00:29:09.251 --> 00:29:12.410
flank, just as the British, who had not been swept aside,

544
00:29:12.470 --> 00:29:15.810
but was still occupying the Ridge line that held all day defeated in attack

545
00:29:15.811 --> 00:29:18.370
spearheaded by the wanted French Imperial guards.

546
00:29:18.390 --> 00:29:21.810
The collapse of the guard triggered a route of the entire French army and just

547
00:29:21.811 --> 00:29:22.390
like that,

548
00:29:22.390 --> 00:29:26.960
it was all over Wellington and Lucia were masters of the field and Napoleon was

549
00:29:27.120 --> 00:29:29.760
finished less than a week after the battle. He had to have catered again,

550
00:29:29.761 --> 00:29:31.200
never to return again to power.

551
00:29:31.220 --> 00:29:34.000
And after over 20 years of almost continuous conflict,

552
00:29:34.020 --> 00:29:36.200
Europe was at last a peace.

553
00:29:42.490 --> 00:29:46.120
Wellington was already a hero before the battle of Waterloo when his victorious

554
00:29:46.121 --> 00:29:49.800
armies had marched over 6,000 miles across Spain and Portugal and defeated a

555
00:29:49.801 --> 00:29:53.560
parade of French marshals and a king too. But after defeating the,

556
00:29:53.880 --> 00:29:57.880
he crossed into the realm of legend at the same level as Admiral Hario Nelson,

557
00:29:58.060 --> 00:30:01.430
who had decisively defeated the French Navy at 10 years earlier,

558
00:30:01.570 --> 00:30:03.990
the nations of Europe lined up to throw honors at him.

559
00:30:04.010 --> 00:30:08.150
He eventually acquired field martial bats from eight different countries and was

560
00:30:08.151 --> 00:30:11.750
bestowed with noble rank or honors by 18 nations. Reportedly.

561
00:30:11.751 --> 00:30:14.390
If he had fixed all the medals, he had earned to his uniform,

562
00:30:14.610 --> 00:30:17.190
it would've been too heavy to wear to war, but Wellington,

563
00:30:17.200 --> 00:30:21.220
after over 20 years of military service had grown tired of war riding among to

564
00:30:21.221 --> 00:30:24.580
the slaughter of the battle of Waterloo. He wept and was hard to say.

565
00:30:24.820 --> 00:30:28.140
I pray to God. I've seen my last battle true to his word.

566
00:30:28.720 --> 00:30:31.060
He never saw combat again, returning to England.

567
00:30:31.061 --> 00:30:34.660
Wellington discovered that not only was he one of the most influential men in

568
00:30:34.661 --> 00:30:36.860
the kingdom now, but he was also one of the most admir.

569
00:30:37.080 --> 00:30:39.940
It became fashionable to dress as Wellington did while on campaign.

570
00:30:40.080 --> 00:30:43.210
And the man soon found himself at the center of London politics. Yes,

571
00:30:43.230 --> 00:30:45.370
it seemed everyone got along well with the war hero,

572
00:30:45.510 --> 00:30:47.730
except unfortunately for his wife,

573
00:30:47.740 --> 00:30:52.650
Wellington had married Catherine kitty Packenham in 1806 and she had born in

574
00:30:52.651 --> 00:30:54.770
two children, Arthur and Charles, however,

575
00:30:54.900 --> 00:30:58.410
Wellington soon made it clear that he found her to be unpleasant company.

576
00:30:58.590 --> 00:31:00.730
And the marriage was not a particularly happy one.

577
00:31:01.050 --> 00:31:02.680
The two spent much of that time apart.

578
00:31:02.681 --> 00:31:07.000
Wellington had been in Spain for years during the war while Kitti had remained

579
00:31:07.001 --> 00:31:10.320
in London. Instead, Wellington was known to enjoy the company of other women.

580
00:31:10.520 --> 00:31:13.000
A fact that was hardly a secret in London society,

581
00:31:13.270 --> 00:31:14.880
even being lampooned in the press.

582
00:31:14.950 --> 00:31:18.520
When one publisher wrote a letter asking the duke for money in exchange for not

583
00:31:18.521 --> 00:31:21.080
publishing the lurid memoirs of one of his mistress,

584
00:31:21.090 --> 00:31:24.870
Wellington supposedly were responded to the blackmail attempt by replying

585
00:31:24.871 --> 00:31:26.990
publish and be damned never.

586
00:31:27.150 --> 00:31:30.070
The last Wellington became an increasingly important member of the Tory party

587
00:31:30.320 --> 00:31:33.190
until in 1828, it was made prime minister.

588
00:31:33.210 --> 00:31:36.310
One of the last members of the house of Lords to serve in that role,

589
00:31:36.490 --> 00:31:40.910
his ministry was dominated by the issue of Catholic emancipation for almost 300

590
00:31:40.911 --> 00:31:45.140
years ever since king Henry thei with the Roman Catholic church and founded the

591
00:31:45.141 --> 00:31:49.060
church of England Catholics and Protestants had battled for influence in power

592
00:31:49.061 --> 00:31:49.894
in gray Britain.

593
00:31:50.080 --> 00:31:54.140
The issue was seemingly decided in the Protestants favor when the Catholic king

594
00:31:54.141 --> 00:31:58.420
James II was deposed in favor of the Protestant king William thei to keep their

595
00:31:58.421 --> 00:32:02.340
hold on power. The Protestants had passed what was known as penal laws, harsh,

596
00:32:03.220 --> 00:32:06.490
discriminatory Ray regulations designed to make Catholic second class citizens

597
00:32:06.491 --> 00:32:07.220
within the kingdom.

598
00:32:07.220 --> 00:32:10.970
While most of the more harsh measures had been repealed by the 1820s.

599
00:32:11.020 --> 00:32:12.330
There were still laws on the books,

600
00:32:12.400 --> 00:32:14.930
banning Catholics from serving in most public officers.

601
00:32:15.000 --> 00:32:17.770
They could it be judges sheriff. So sit in parliament,

602
00:32:17.771 --> 00:32:19.570
Wellington had grown up in Irelands,

603
00:32:19.571 --> 00:32:23.690
which was majority Catholic and many of his best soldiers in Spain were Irish.

604
00:32:24.080 --> 00:32:26.960
He had great sympathy for their plight and as a result,

605
00:32:26.961 --> 00:32:29.120
he pushed hard for the repeal of these laws,

606
00:32:29.121 --> 00:32:33.600
which was accompanied with the passing of the Catholic relief act of 1829,

607
00:32:33.601 --> 00:32:36.720
despite vigorous opposition from within his own party. However,

608
00:32:36.721 --> 00:32:40.480
Wellington's government was brought down in 1830 when a wave of civil unrest

609
00:32:40.481 --> 00:32:43.560
prompted by the unfair rules government's election to the house of commons that

610
00:32:43.561 --> 00:32:46.840
were heavily tilted in favor of the rich and powerful swept the country.

611
00:32:46.890 --> 00:32:51.160
Parliament voted on a vote of no confidence in Wellington's ministry.

612
00:32:51.260 --> 00:32:52.960
And Wellington resigned in November.

613
00:32:59.160 --> 00:33:02.830
Wellington remains an important political figure as the Tory party transformed

614
00:33:02.831 --> 00:33:04.990
into the conservative party led by sir Rob peel.

615
00:33:05.050 --> 00:33:08.190
He would serve as a cabinet minister in Peel's government and as the

616
00:33:08.191 --> 00:33:11.470
conservative leader of the house of Lords until his retirement in 1846,

617
00:33:11.650 --> 00:33:14.150
he also served as an advisor to the young queen Victoria.

618
00:33:14.330 --> 00:33:17.510
The duke of Wellington died on the 14th of September,

619
00:33:17.510 --> 00:33:20.140
1852 in Kent at the 80 of 83 from a stroke.

620
00:33:20.320 --> 00:33:22.380
His body was transported by train to London,

621
00:33:22.430 --> 00:33:24.180
where he was honored with the state funeral,

622
00:33:24.360 --> 00:33:27.780
the firsts in Admiral Nelson in 1805. He was buried in St.

623
00:33:27.781 --> 00:33:29.140
Paul's cathedral next to Nelson,

624
00:33:29.280 --> 00:33:33.060
who had met once a few weeks before the Admiral's death and had a long

625
00:33:33.061 --> 00:33:36.100
conversation with him. The legacy of the duke of Wellington is enormous.

626
00:33:36.320 --> 00:33:36.760
His name,

627
00:33:36.760 --> 00:33:40.610
adorns everything from the Capitol city of new Zealand's to a popular style of

628
00:33:40.611 --> 00:33:41.190
boots.

629
00:33:41.190 --> 00:33:45.050
His military tactics inspired a generation of military scholars and generals,

630
00:33:45.051 --> 00:33:48.130
and can be seen most clearly in the campaigns of Robert E.

631
00:33:48.130 --> 00:33:50.250
Lee during the American civil war. Most importantly,

632
00:33:50.251 --> 00:33:54.290
his victory over Napole usher in an unprecedented period of peace and prosperity

633
00:33:54.350 --> 00:33:55.410
on the European Conson.

634
00:33:55.411 --> 00:33:59.290
That lasted until the outbreak of the first world war a century later with less

635
00:33:59.291 --> 00:34:01.360
focus on mill at campaigns and destruction,

636
00:34:01.660 --> 00:34:04.760
the European nations instead focused on industrial outputs.

637
00:34:04.960 --> 00:34:06.800
And later on social wealth app,

638
00:34:06.860 --> 00:34:10.200
it was an incredibly transformative period that likely would not have been

639
00:34:10.320 --> 00:34:14.840
possible without the work of one man who rose from acuity to become perhaps the

640
00:34:14.960 --> 00:34:17.320
greatest soldier that United Kingdom has ever seen.

641
00:34:17.660 --> 00:34:19.560
