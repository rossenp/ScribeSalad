<v 0>Down. Biographics mobsters, lots of B roll with wise guys,</v>

2
00:00:03.290 --> 00:00:06.920
Cuban cigars and their attractive girlfriends and slicked back hair.

3
00:00:06.921 --> 00:00:08.520
Unfortunately, not all of us are gifted,

4
00:00:08.521 --> 00:00:11.120
such wonderful genetics at top our heads. Fortunately,

5
00:00:11.121 --> 00:00:13.080
if you're someone who's worried about losing his hair,

6
00:00:13.081 --> 00:00:15.720
there is today's sponsor keeps.

7
00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:18.960
Did you know that two out of every three guys will experience some form of male

8
00:00:19.240 --> 00:00:22.870
pass and boldness by the time the five? Well, I definitely know it for me.

9
00:00:22.871 --> 00:00:25.270
It was 25. I wish keeps have been arounds when I was younger,

10
00:00:25.271 --> 00:00:28.230
because advancements in science have meant that there are now treatments that

11
00:00:28.231 --> 00:00:31.790
can combat the symptoms of hair loss and help you keep your hair.

12
00:00:31.940 --> 00:00:33.950
It's too late for me. My hair's not coming back,

13
00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:36.430
but you don't have to be like me. You can stop your hair loss early.

14
00:00:36.431 --> 00:00:41.300
Thanks to keeps keeps offers generic versions of the only two FDA of prove

15
00:00:41.301 --> 00:00:44.220
drugs for treating hair loss. So you may have tried them before,

16
00:00:44.480 --> 00:00:48.180
but never at a price this low that's right. If you're thinking, oh,

17
00:00:48.430 --> 00:00:51.860
Simon medicine for hair loss, it's gonna be expensive. Oh no.

18
00:00:51.861 --> 00:00:54.860
Keep starts at just $10 a month. How does it work? Well for one thing,

19
00:00:54.861 --> 00:00:56.180
there's no need to visit a doctor's office.

20
00:00:56.181 --> 00:00:59.100
Just schedule a quick online consult and a bit later, boom,

So if you are noticing that you're losing your hair, that's one problem.

24
00:01:08.011 --> 00:01:10.730
That's not gonna fix itself. Do something about it for a limited time,

27
00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:25.320
He would've been chairman of the board of general motors.

28
00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:27.560
If they'd gone into legitimate businesses,

29
00:01:27.620 --> 00:01:32.440
how an FBI agent once described Lansky with a note of reluctant

30
00:01:32.630 --> 00:01:33.760
respect in his voice,

31
00:01:34.480 --> 00:01:36.360
Lansky was one of the most powerful people in the math here,

32
00:01:36.361 --> 00:01:39.880
even though technically he was only an associate because he was Jewish,

33
00:01:40.220 --> 00:01:42.400
not Italian. The most mob bosses were perfect.

34
00:01:42.790 --> 00:01:46.750
Be happy to gloss over that minor detail because working with landscape was an

35
00:01:46.751 --> 00:01:51.390
almost sure far away of making money and all of them above any loyalties,

36
00:01:51.391 --> 00:01:54.870
traditions and beliefs liked making money.

37
00:01:55.910 --> 00:01:59.470
Lansky had the mid touch when it came to illegal business nicknames,

38
00:01:59.471 --> 00:02:00.304
the mobs account,

39
00:02:00.430 --> 00:02:04.700
and he allegedly once boasted that it took the mob and made it bigger than us

40
00:02:04.790 --> 00:02:07.660
steel. And at the height of its power, it might have been right.

41
00:02:14.900 --> 00:02:19.620
Lansky was born Maya Suski on July the fourth, 1902 in the city of gro,

42
00:02:19.860 --> 00:02:22.620
no Belarus, which back then was a part of the Russian em empire.

43
00:02:22.680 --> 00:02:25.850
At the very least as the birthday that was written on his immigration records.

44
00:02:25.960 --> 00:02:27.410
When his family traveled to America,

45
00:02:27.411 --> 00:02:30.250
his parents didn't actually remember his exact date of birth.

46
00:02:30.630 --> 00:02:33.890
So it was more of an estimate. Mars parents were Polish Jews.

47
00:02:33.891 --> 00:02:36.330
They experienced a lot of violence and antisemitism.

48
00:02:36.410 --> 00:02:39.610
And so their goal was to leave the Russian em empire and move to the new world.

49
00:02:39.790 --> 00:02:42.410
His father went on ahead alone and in 1911,

50
00:02:42.411 --> 00:02:46.080
the rest of the family followed and settle all down in Manhattan's lower east

51
00:02:46.190 --> 00:02:49.200
side Lansky's life as a petty criminal started when he was a teenager,

52
00:02:49.460 --> 00:02:52.720
but it went to the next level in 1918, when he met his future partner,

53
00:02:52.830 --> 00:02:56.880
another notorious Jewish mobster named Bugsy Siegel. According to one story,

54
00:02:56.881 --> 00:02:57.720
the two became friends.

55
00:02:57.740 --> 00:03:00.960
One day when Lansky was coming back to school and he saw Siegel in trouble

56
00:03:00.961 --> 00:03:02.560
during a fight over a craps game,

57
00:03:02.840 --> 00:03:04.640
intervened on Siegel's behalf and moments later,

58
00:03:04.641 --> 00:03:07.520
the police showed up prompting the two delinquent to run away together.

59
00:03:07.670 --> 00:03:11.480
Just a quick heads up from this moment on Lansky's career was closely

60
00:03:11.630 --> 00:03:14.360
intertwined for decades without a Bugsy Siegel.

61
00:03:14.370 --> 00:03:16.680
We've already covered SIGAR here on biographics.

62
00:03:16.681 --> 00:03:19.590
So maybe give that video or watch after words, if you haven't seen it.

63
00:03:19.810 --> 00:03:21.550
So if there are areas we brush over,

64
00:03:21.570 --> 00:03:24.950
that's probably because we already went in depth on them in the Siegel video.

65
00:03:25.060 --> 00:03:27.150
Plus there is a lot more ground to cover here.

66
00:03:27.160 --> 00:03:31.790
Since landscape went on for another 35 years after Siegel's death. Anyway,

67
00:03:31.791 --> 00:03:34.190
the two criminals soon forms the bugs and ma mob,

68
00:03:34.191 --> 00:03:37.630
which steadily became one of the most powerful Jewish mobs in Manhattan

69
00:03:37.680 --> 00:03:41.620
throughout the 1920, be handled racketeering extortion, burglaries,

70
00:03:41.621 --> 00:03:45.940
money lending, car theft, gambling, and once prohibition kicked in boot lagging,

71
00:03:45.941 --> 00:03:49.380
eventually they turned to killing as well and actually became quite notorious

72
00:03:49.381 --> 00:03:50.260
for their blood. First,

73
00:03:50.580 --> 00:03:53.780
as other gangs began making use of their murder for horror services.

74
00:03:53.870 --> 00:03:57.100
Bugsy Siegel was usually the one who was at the head of the hit squad while

75
00:03:57.580 --> 00:03:59.770
landscape preferred the role in the shadows as acting hours,

76
00:03:59.771 --> 00:04:00.690
the brains of the outfit,

77
00:04:07.070 --> 00:04:08.970
The profile of the bugs and Mar mob grew,

78
00:04:09.170 --> 00:04:12.730
but it was a landscape's association with a different man that enabled him to

79
00:04:12.731 --> 00:04:13.650
rise through the ranks.

80
00:04:13.651 --> 00:04:16.450
Ultimately becoming one of the most powerful mobsters in America.

81
00:04:16.800 --> 00:04:19.610
That man was Charles lucky Lucha. Again,

82
00:04:19.611 --> 00:04:22.280
we are relying on a bit of mob law here,

83
00:04:22.300 --> 00:04:25.120
but it has said that the two met when they were teenagers, when Lucha,

84
00:04:25.260 --> 00:04:28.600
who was five years older, tried to extort money from landscape the latter,

85
00:04:28.601 --> 00:04:29.760
even though he was younger and smaller,

86
00:04:29.820 --> 00:04:32.120
did not back down and was getting ready for a fight. However,

87
00:04:32.560 --> 00:04:36.000
Lucha admire the Jewish boy for his toughness and his instinct tolls him that it

88
00:04:36.001 --> 00:04:39.560
would be better to make a friends than a faux outta Lansky.

89
00:04:39.820 --> 00:04:43.070
And boy was he right? Working together,

90
00:04:43.630 --> 00:04:46.710
Lucha and landscape enacted a revolution within the American mob.

91
00:04:46.850 --> 00:04:50.790
One that saw numerous Italian Jewish factions from all over the country ban

92
00:04:50.990 --> 00:04:54.750
together in order to maximize their profits and minimize the inhouse fighting,

93
00:04:54.751 --> 00:04:55.870
which was bad for business.

94
00:04:55.940 --> 00:04:59.270
This was accomplished by establishing the national crime syndicate,

95
00:04:59.271 --> 00:05:01.620
where the decisions were made by the commission,

96
00:05:01.660 --> 00:05:06.100
a group that represented the interests of all of the members instead of a single

97
00:05:06.160 --> 00:05:08.900
man commonly referred to as the boss, all bosses,

98
00:05:09.080 --> 00:05:12.340
the birth of the commission was an important landmark in the history of the

99
00:05:12.430 --> 00:05:15.860
mafia. One that changed forever how organized crime operated in America.

100
00:05:15.960 --> 00:05:19.340
It was mainly the brain chart of lucky Lucha who went on to become the

101
00:05:19.341 --> 00:05:20.460
commission's first chairman.

102
00:05:20.940 --> 00:05:25.290
That my ski also helped immensely by organizing the meeting where all the mobs

103
00:05:25.291 --> 00:05:28.690
gathered together for the first time to discuss the terms of venue arrangement.

104
00:05:28.750 --> 00:05:32.530
The summit occurred between the 13th and the 16th of May,

105
00:05:32.530 --> 00:05:36.130
1929 and was known as the Atlantic city conference. Once it had concluded,

106
00:05:36.190 --> 00:05:40.010
it was time to get rid of the old timers, the so-called mustache, Pete,

107
00:05:40.370 --> 00:05:43.880
who came from the old country and had intention of relinquishing power to a

108
00:05:43.881 --> 00:05:46.840
committee at the time, there wasn't just one boss of all bosses,

109
00:05:46.900 --> 00:05:49.400
but there were actually two men fighting over supremacy.

110
00:05:49.560 --> 00:05:52.640
And what was known as the Castella Mai war, one of them was Joe,

111
00:05:52.740 --> 00:05:53.880
the boss Masser R,

112
00:05:53.940 --> 00:05:58.480
and the other was Salvador Marza Licha was actually a Lieutenant for mare at the

113
00:05:58.481 --> 00:06:01.960
time, but he betrayed him and arranged his assassination for Mozo.

114
00:06:02.020 --> 00:06:05.880
In order to end the war in April, 1931, then just a few months later,

115
00:06:05.940 --> 00:06:10.520
he also planned the murder of Marzano officially ushering in the era of that

116
00:06:10.521 --> 00:06:12.560
commission. As far as Maya Lansky was concerned,

117
00:06:12.620 --> 00:06:16.440
his mob provided some of the hit men used in both assassinations because the

118
00:06:16.510 --> 00:06:18.550
commission was strictly an Italian thing.

119
00:06:19.110 --> 00:06:20.990
Landscape could not have an official seat at the table,

120
00:06:21.130 --> 00:06:24.270
but unofficially he became Lu's right hands man.

121
00:06:24.370 --> 00:06:28.270
And the two of them worked together on most business dealings after prohibition

122
00:06:28.271 --> 00:06:32.350
ended the bugs and ma mob disbanded as both I and Siegel took on bigger roles,

123
00:06:33.030 --> 00:06:34.590
independent of each other within the syndicate

124
00:06:40.980 --> 00:06:43.020
Prohibition had been a giant boom for my L ski.

125
00:06:43.100 --> 00:06:45.020
And his crew was bootlegging was his main moneymaker.

126
00:06:45.300 --> 00:06:46.940
But once he came to an end in 1933,

127
00:06:47.040 --> 00:06:50.460
he needed a new cash cow and he found it in gambling. Don't get us wrong.

128
00:06:50.780 --> 00:06:54.060
The mob had already been involved with gambling for decades, but until then,

129
00:06:54.080 --> 00:06:57.930
nobody really had landscape's ambition to set up large operations in multiple

130
00:06:57.931 --> 00:07:01.730
cities. He started with Florida in the mid 1930s, then expanded to new Orleans.

131
00:07:02.030 --> 00:07:05.410
Pretty much every business landscape got involved with turned to profit,

132
00:07:05.470 --> 00:07:09.850
and he had a reputation that his upscale establishments known as carpet joints

133
00:07:09.851 --> 00:07:10.850
were all legit.

134
00:07:10.910 --> 00:07:14.130
So gamblers did not have to worry about the tables being rigged when they played

135
00:07:14.210 --> 00:07:14.910
at his casinos.

136
00:07:14.910 --> 00:07:17.890
The one investments that proved problematic came almost a decade later,

137
00:07:18.560 --> 00:07:20.360
and it was the Flamingo hotel in Las Vegas.

138
00:07:20.620 --> 00:07:23.520
It was the pet project of Lansky's former partner, Bugsy Siegel.

139
00:07:23.520 --> 00:07:24.840
While landscape was busy,

140
00:07:24.841 --> 00:07:28.720
setting up a gambling empire Siegel took over operations in Los Angeles and

141
00:07:28.890 --> 00:07:31.880
began ping around with Hollywood's rich and famous from there.

142
00:07:32.200 --> 00:07:35.720
Siegel got the inspired idea to build a new hotel and casino on a stretch of

143
00:07:35.721 --> 00:07:39.510
mainly undeveloped land in Nevada, which would later become the Vegas strip.

144
00:07:39.650 --> 00:07:42.430
But contrary to miss, it was not the first casino on the strip.

145
00:07:42.431 --> 00:07:46.910
So boxy Siegel did not invent Las Vegas to spite the popular saying.

146
00:07:47.130 --> 00:07:50.430
The one thing that SIOR did do was convince many of his mobs to buddies,

147
00:07:50.450 --> 00:07:54.550
to invest in the Flamingo, including my landscape. Unfortunately for him,

148
00:07:54.910 --> 00:07:56.750
Siegel was good at being criminal, not a builder.

149
00:07:56.850 --> 00:07:59.820
The original budget for the construction was around or 1.5 billion,

150
00:08:00.280 --> 00:08:04.460
but it ended up costing over 6 million, mainly due to delays contractors,

151
00:08:04.461 --> 00:08:06.500
taking advantage of seagulls in experience,

152
00:08:06.520 --> 00:08:09.780
and the possibility that the mob himself was skimming off the top.

153
00:08:10.010 --> 00:08:11.940
This landed seagull in hot water with the mob.

154
00:08:11.941 --> 00:08:15.620
And it was only a Mylan skis insistence that he was momentarily given a repre.

155
00:08:15.900 --> 00:08:15.901
Well,

156
00:08:15.901 --> 00:08:19.460
then the Flamingo actually opens and the inauguration went terribly because the

157
00:08:19.570 --> 00:08:21.610
hotel was not finished yet, just the casino.

158
00:08:21.710 --> 00:08:25.330
So people went in gambled one and then took their winnings and went someplace

159
00:08:25.331 --> 00:08:26.051
else. Again.

160
00:08:26.051 --> 00:08:29.090
Siegel's head was on the chopping block and landscape to intervene to save the

161
00:08:29.091 --> 00:08:32.170
neck of his former partner. Of course Lansky's reach was long,

162
00:08:32.171 --> 00:08:34.530
but it wasn't endless. He couldn't save Siegel forever.

163
00:08:34.531 --> 00:08:36.530
Especially as fears were growing inside the mob.

164
00:08:36.670 --> 00:08:38.650
Not only that Siegel had been stealing from them,

165
00:08:38.790 --> 00:08:42.120
but that he was planning on king, a run for it to Europe, with his girlfriend,

166
00:08:42.360 --> 00:08:45.640
Virginia Hill on the 20th of June, 1947, Bugsy was gunned down in Hills,

167
00:08:45.641 --> 00:08:48.880
California home. And although the identity of the shooter remains a mystery,

168
00:08:49.120 --> 00:08:52.200
that was almost certainly a mob here that had been approved by Mar lke,

169
00:08:52.201 --> 00:08:54.560
allegedly less than half an hour after Eagle's death.

170
00:08:54.561 --> 00:08:57.720
Some of his associates entered the Flamingo and took over the operation.

171
00:08:57.780 --> 00:09:00.600
The hotel and casino scene became profitable and landscape maintained his

172
00:09:00.800 --> 00:09:01.633
interest in it for decades.

173
00:09:07.910 --> 00:09:12.040
They often say that the enemy of my enemy is my friends and that concept was

174
00:09:12.090 --> 00:09:13.640
truly tested during world Wari.

175
00:09:13.641 --> 00:09:16.950
The mob might have been no violence organization responsible for countless

176
00:09:16.951 --> 00:09:21.150
illegal activities, but it still was nowhere near as bad as the Nazis.

177
00:09:21.260 --> 00:09:24.310
Once the United States entered the war against the access powers,

178
00:09:24.311 --> 00:09:27.510
they sought out support from the mafia in a unique Alliance,

179
00:09:27.570 --> 00:09:28.950
dubbed operation underworld,

180
00:09:28.951 --> 00:09:32.350
basically it all started when America captured a former French ocean liner

181
00:09:32.370 --> 00:09:36.460
dubbed the SS Normandy, renamed it, USS laugh outs,

182
00:09:36.461 --> 00:09:38.340
converted it into a troop ship. However,

183
00:09:38.560 --> 00:09:42.620
it never saw action as a capsized and San while sitting in new York's PI 88 in

184
00:09:42.621 --> 00:09:45.620
the winter of 1942, the circumstances were suspicious.

185
00:09:45.621 --> 00:09:49.260
And the us government feared that the ship had been sabotaged by Nazi spies and

186
00:09:49.261 --> 00:09:49.821
sympathizers.

187
00:09:49.821 --> 00:09:52.780
Therefore the government reached out to an organization that they knew could

188
00:09:52.781 --> 00:09:55.890
control the labor unions and maintain order on the, of France,

189
00:09:56.390 --> 00:09:57.490
the math app in March,

190
00:09:57.491 --> 00:10:01.810
they reached out to a Geneve Lieutenant named Joseph Lanza and he sent word up

191
00:10:01.811 --> 00:10:03.490
the train of command to Lucha.

192
00:10:03.710 --> 00:10:07.410
By that point Liano had been imprisons and he was glad to help an exchange for

193
00:10:07.411 --> 00:10:09.410
an early release. The authorities agreed to the terms,

194
00:10:09.610 --> 00:10:12.650
although Lu Chao's release also came with a deportation to Italy.

195
00:10:12.770 --> 00:10:16.960
Nowadays it is a matter of historical debate of operation under world was of any

196
00:10:16.961 --> 00:10:18.680
actual help to the war effort or not.

197
00:10:18.900 --> 00:10:23.240
But there was at least one mob who was more proactive and took up arms again to

198
00:10:23.241 --> 00:10:25.360
the Nazis, even before America joined the war.

199
00:10:25.840 --> 00:10:27.520
And that was Lansky since he was Jewish.

200
00:10:27.670 --> 00:10:31.280
It's not surprising that Lansky hated the Nazis and ever since the 1930s, he,

201
00:10:31.480 --> 00:10:35.160
as men went around, busting up rallies by pro Nazi organizations,

202
00:10:35.190 --> 00:10:37.710
such as the silver shirts, the German American bun,

203
00:10:37.711 --> 00:10:39.150
according to some historians,

204
00:10:39.630 --> 00:10:42.710
Lansky even did this with the tacit approval of certain New York officials who

205
00:10:42.840 --> 00:10:45.390
hated the Nazis, but couldn't do anything to stop them legally.

206
00:10:45.570 --> 00:10:49.230
So instead they turned to the mob with the understanding that Blansky and his

207
00:10:49.430 --> 00:10:52.070
man were free to break arms and legs and cracks and skulls,

208
00:10:52.071 --> 00:10:53.070
but couldn't kill anybody.

209
00:10:53.430 --> 00:10:57.220
Blan scheme self described how he and his gang busted up on brown shirt rally in

210
00:10:57.380 --> 00:11:00.660
Manhattan. The stage was decorated with a swastika and a picture of Hitler.

211
00:11:00.661 --> 00:11:04.100
The speakers started ranting. There were only 15 of us, but we went into action.

212
00:11:04.240 --> 00:11:07.660
We threw some of them outta the windows. Most of the Nazis panicked and ran out.

213
00:11:07.720 --> 00:11:08.980
We chased them and beat them up.

214
00:11:09.040 --> 00:11:13.340
We wanted to show them that Jews would not always sit back and accept insults

215
00:11:19.710 --> 00:11:22.610
As successful as landscape's businesses in the United States were,

216
00:11:22.611 --> 00:11:25.890
they didn't quite live up to his vision of a gambling paradise where he and his

217
00:11:25.891 --> 00:11:29.450
partners could exercise control over politicians and operate free from the

218
00:11:29.610 --> 00:11:31.930
scrutiny of the us government to fulfill his ambition.

219
00:11:32.530 --> 00:11:33.570
Lansky intended to go to Cuba.

220
00:11:33.640 --> 00:11:36.250
It's unclear if landscape always considered the Caribbean country,

221
00:11:36.490 --> 00:11:37.230
an ideal target,

222
00:11:37.230 --> 00:11:41.240
or if the opportunity simply presented itself and he immediately recognized the

223
00:11:41.241 --> 00:11:45.640
potential, but his dealings in Cuba started in the late 1930s earlier in 1933,

224
00:11:45.641 --> 00:11:49.600
there had been an uprising in Cuba known as the sergeants revolt president har

225
00:11:49.880 --> 00:11:53.560
Geraldo Mao was overthrown and he was succeeded by multiple heads of state with

226
00:11:53.561 --> 00:11:56.920
very short terms. Most of them didn't actually have any real authorities.

227
00:11:56.990 --> 00:12:00.200
Most of the power was in the hands of a Colonel named Phil Henio,

228
00:12:01.040 --> 00:12:04.640
Batista who had control of Cuba armed forces. Finally in 1940,

229
00:12:04.660 --> 00:12:08.080
he won the presidential election and became the new preside of Cuba in decades.

230
00:12:08.440 --> 00:12:11.440
Past the country's capital Havana had been a hotspot for the rich and famous

231
00:12:11.441 --> 00:12:15.150
coming over from the United States to indulge in gambling and nightlife.

232
00:12:15.390 --> 00:12:16.750
But Easter wanted to bring that back.

233
00:12:16.770 --> 00:12:20.030
So he enlisted the help of several people to get Cuba's entertainment industries

234
00:12:20.100 --> 00:12:20.930
back on their feet.

235
00:12:20.930 --> 00:12:25.030
And this included by landscape who was brought into help revitalize the casinos

236
00:12:25.031 --> 00:12:28.670
because of his reputation of running profitable and respectable upscale carpet

237
00:12:28.730 --> 00:12:32.150
joints back in America landscape of course could spot a good thing.

238
00:12:32.151 --> 00:12:32.984
When he saw once a,

239
00:12:33.180 --> 00:12:36.060
he began cultivating a working relationship with the Cuban leader that would

240
00:12:36.061 --> 00:12:37.700
last for decades. At the end of the day,

241
00:12:37.730 --> 00:12:40.140
they both shared a vision for what cuber could become.

242
00:12:40.360 --> 00:12:43.940
It looks like Ky and Batista were going to make a lot of money together,

243
00:12:43.960 --> 00:12:47.820
but something unexpected happened in 1944, Batista lost power.

244
00:12:47.960 --> 00:12:50.260
It was time for a new election. The Colonel did not run again,

245
00:12:50.360 --> 00:12:54.410
but he hands picked his successor fully expecting him to win. Ands,

246
00:12:54.411 --> 00:12:55.250
become the new president,

247
00:12:55.480 --> 00:12:58.730
basically acting as a puppet who still carried out Batist disorders,

248
00:12:58.731 --> 00:13:00.250
but he actually lost the election.

249
00:13:00.390 --> 00:13:04.650
And the new Cuban president Ramon grow didn't share Batiste's interest in

250
00:13:04.890 --> 00:13:06.930
gambling and Neith did a success up.

251
00:13:06.931 --> 00:13:10.010
That meant that for eight years Lansky's plans in Cuba were put on hold.

252
00:13:10.080 --> 00:13:14.280
They resumed in 1952 when Batista stage another co and seized power one and

253
00:13:14.520 --> 00:13:18.280
small in between Batista's two times as leader of Cuba, Lansky had no choice,

254
00:13:18.281 --> 00:13:20.000
but to focus his attention elsewhere.

255
00:13:20.100 --> 00:13:23.400
But one notable thing did occur in the country. During that time,

256
00:13:23.900 --> 00:13:27.280
the Havana conference, it was held during the week of December the 22nd,

257
00:13:27.560 --> 00:13:32.000
1946 at the hotel NA now to Cuba like the summit from Atlantic city held in

258
00:13:32.200 --> 00:13:32.910
1929.

259
00:13:32.910 --> 00:13:36.510
This was a major gathering of all the top mobsters to discuss some pressing

260
00:13:36.511 --> 00:13:38.710
matters. It was organized by Lansky and Lucha,

261
00:13:38.850 --> 00:13:42.990
and it was held in Cuba so that Lucha could attend after having been deported to

262
00:13:42.991 --> 00:13:43.340
Italy.

263
00:13:43.340 --> 00:13:46.630
Some of the important topics discussed include the mafia's role in the drug

264
00:13:46.631 --> 00:13:48.910
trade. What they intended to do about Bugsy Siegel,

265
00:13:48.911 --> 00:13:52.110
who at the time was having problems with the Flamingo hotel and tensions that

266
00:13:52.111 --> 00:13:54.870
were brewing in the Lucha family is veto gen.

267
00:13:55.340 --> 00:13:58.900
He was making a play to become the new Don since lucky he couldn't travel to the

268
00:13:59.140 --> 00:13:59.900
us anymore.

269
00:13:59.900 --> 00:14:03.900
Their role in Cuba was also debated while many other mobs shared S's vision for

270
00:14:03.901 --> 00:14:05.780
this. They needed Batista back in power,

271
00:14:05.920 --> 00:14:08.860
or at least somebody else willing to open the country up to them.

272
00:14:15.100 --> 00:14:19.810
A few went by and in 1952, Phil Henio Batista staged military co on paper.

273
00:14:20.110 --> 00:14:24.290
He was a provisional president, but in reality, he was the new dictator of Cuba.

274
00:14:24.350 --> 00:14:28.770
And he was ready to turn Havana into a hedonistic playgrounds for rich tourists

275
00:14:29.050 --> 00:14:32.210
while my Lansky and laughter tripping over themselves to provide Cuba with all

276
00:14:32.211 --> 00:14:34.610
the gambling, drugs and prostitutes that could have a need.

277
00:14:34.890 --> 00:14:38.240
One Cuban historian described honor during the 1950s as being what Las Vegas

278
00:14:38.250 --> 00:14:40.240
would eventually become for just $50.

279
00:14:40.280 --> 00:14:43.560
Tourists could fly in from Florida and the money would be enough to cover their

280
00:14:43.561 --> 00:14:46.160
flights, their hotel rooms, and leave enough spending cash.

281
00:14:46.220 --> 00:14:50.320
So they could entertain themselves at brothels, buffets, beaches, casinos clubs,

282
00:14:50.460 --> 00:14:51.293
and cabarets,

283
00:14:51.360 --> 00:14:54.800
which were all a short walking distance from each other on the mob side of

284
00:14:54.801 --> 00:14:55.090
things.

285
00:14:55.090 --> 00:14:59.920
Operations were mainly hands OND by Lansky and man named Santo traffic can Jr.

286
00:15:00.440 --> 00:15:02.720
Head of the traffic can crime family based out of Tampa.

287
00:15:02.900 --> 00:15:05.160
The latter controls most criminal activities in Florida.

288
00:15:05.300 --> 00:15:09.280
So naturally most shipments that went to and from Cuba pass his territory.

289
00:15:09.840 --> 00:15:10.750
Lansky started by a Pinn,

290
00:15:10.790 --> 00:15:14.350
a few nightclubs and casinos such as the Mon mater club and the Tropicana.

291
00:15:14.750 --> 00:15:18.990
He then persuaded Batista to renovate of honors already iconic hotel NA now,

292
00:15:19.050 --> 00:15:20.710
and turn one of the wings into a casino.

293
00:15:20.890 --> 00:15:24.590
The money was pouring in the Cub government was incredibly friendly towards

294
00:15:24.591 --> 00:15:27.590
foreign investments and showed little concern for the source of this new

295
00:15:27.591 --> 00:15:29.510
revenue. As long as they invested enough money,

296
00:15:29.690 --> 00:15:33.620
the mob had no trouble acquiring all the licenses they needed and even receive

297
00:15:33.720 --> 00:15:36.260
tax breaks and public matching funds for construction.

298
00:15:36.560 --> 00:15:39.540
The fifties were very profitable for Lansky and his associates,

299
00:15:39.541 --> 00:15:42.340
but he wanted even more like his one time partner, Bugsy Siegel,

300
00:15:42.900 --> 00:15:45.620
Lansky wanted to leave his mark by building his own hotel and casino.

301
00:15:45.960 --> 00:15:49.380
The Havana Riviera construction began in December,

302
00:15:49.380 --> 00:15:52.610
1956 and it finished just a year later, Lansky it, it sped no expense.

303
00:15:52.790 --> 00:15:56.330
The Riviera was the largest and most luxurious casino hotel in Cuba,

304
00:15:56.331 --> 00:16:00.530
situated on prime beachfront property that provided every room with a view of

305
00:16:00.531 --> 00:16:01.890
the Gulf of Mexico. Every week,

306
00:16:01.891 --> 00:16:05.330
there was a new headlining act from Hollywood while may Lansky used the

307
00:16:05.331 --> 00:16:08.770
presidential suite on the top floor as his new headquarters Lansky had achieved

308
00:16:08.830 --> 00:16:10.530
his goal, but it didn't last long.

309
00:16:10.850 --> 00:16:14.240
While Havana had been trying formed into a garden of earthly delights for

310
00:16:14.400 --> 00:16:17.160
American tourists, the rest of Cuba wasn't doing so well.

311
00:16:17.260 --> 00:16:20.920
It suffered due to poverty and corruption. And this led to talks of rebellion,

312
00:16:20.921 --> 00:16:25.760
which were inflamed by a young fire brand named Fidel Castro who had

313
00:16:25.761 --> 00:16:29.280
begun assembling an army of gorillas. At first, the mob was not too concerned,

314
00:16:29.281 --> 00:16:32.280
believing that it would be business as usual, regardless of who was in charge,

315
00:16:32.610 --> 00:16:35.710
but they were wrong. The rebels won on December the 31st, 90,

316
00:16:35.710 --> 00:16:36.543
58 and the following day,

317
00:16:36.630 --> 00:16:40.310
Phil Henio Batista and dozens of his family members and close associates fled

318
00:16:40.340 --> 00:16:40.970
Cuba forever.

319
00:16:40.970 --> 00:16:44.870
But our Castro was now in charge and he brought communism to Cuba within a year.

320
00:16:44.890 --> 00:16:48.310
All industries and businesses had been nationalized. And just like that,

321
00:16:48.410 --> 00:16:51.310
the mob lost all of its assets and revenue sources in Cuba.

322
00:16:57.820 --> 00:17:00.540
Losing cuber was a big blow to the mafia, but especially tomorrow,

323
00:17:00.940 --> 00:17:03.860
lke had invested so much money into the Riviera throughout the 1960s.

324
00:17:03.861 --> 00:17:07.100
Mobsters kept a look out for other locations in the Caribbean and The Bahamas,

325
00:17:07.101 --> 00:17:09.740
which could potentially become the new Havana. At the same time.

326
00:17:09.800 --> 00:17:13.500
It is likely that landscapes associates are holding out hope that Castros really

327
00:17:13.890 --> 00:17:16.970
regime would fall and be replaced with somebody who was friendlier towards

328
00:17:16.971 --> 00:17:19.930
foreign ventures. And it would be back to business like before,

329
00:17:19.931 --> 00:17:21.690
ultimately this did not happen.

330
00:17:21.691 --> 00:17:25.130
And the mob eventually gave up looking in other places and instead chose to

331
00:17:25.131 --> 00:17:27.090
focus its attention on Las Vegas. At that point,

332
00:17:27.110 --> 00:17:30.250
the gambling industry had begun to gain a foothold in the city and Vegas was

333
00:17:30.251 --> 00:17:34.480
showing the first glimpses of why it would soon become since city Myland skis

334
00:17:34.680 --> 00:17:35.880
later years were much more quiet,

335
00:17:36.240 --> 00:17:38.720
although he still maintained an important role in organized crime.

336
00:17:38.720 --> 00:17:40.640
He also invested in legitimate businesses.

337
00:17:40.820 --> 00:17:44.880
His wealth has always been a tricky subject to estimate and has caused a lot of

338
00:17:44.881 --> 00:17:48.320
debate among historians while some believed he was worth hundreds of millions of

339
00:17:48.321 --> 00:17:51.600
dollars at the height of his power. Others think this is sheer fantasy.

340
00:17:51.940 --> 00:17:53.840
He left almost no money behind when he died.

341
00:17:53.841 --> 00:17:56.120
And it's possible that he lost most of his wealth in Cuba.

342
00:17:56.520 --> 00:17:59.080
For most of his criminal career landscape managed to avoid getting into trouble

343
00:17:59.081 --> 00:18:00.640
with the law. But in 1970,

344
00:18:00.660 --> 00:18:04.840
it seemed like he would finally end up behind bars on tax of Eva charges.

345
00:18:04.870 --> 00:18:08.400
That same year. He tried to move to Israel using the country's law of return,

346
00:18:08.510 --> 00:18:11.350
allowed Jews from other places to relocate that however,

347
00:18:11.351 --> 00:18:14.750
the Israeli government could turn down requests from people with criminal pasts

348
00:18:14.751 --> 00:18:16.630
and it did so in landscape's case,

349
00:18:16.770 --> 00:18:19.110
he fought the decision in Israeli court for over two years,

350
00:18:19.290 --> 00:18:22.350
but he eventually lost and was returned to America in 1972.

351
00:18:22.400 --> 00:18:26.070
Ultimately the charges against landscape were dropped in 1974 with a position

352
00:18:26.071 --> 00:18:28.070
ruling that he was too ill to stand trial.

353
00:18:28.870 --> 00:18:31.860
Bylan spent the last years of his life in his home in Miami beach, Florida.

354
00:18:32.040 --> 00:18:34.580
It is unclear how involved he was in the mob at this point,

355
00:18:34.640 --> 00:18:37.420
but it's certain that it was a completely different playing field.

356
00:18:37.640 --> 00:18:41.060
All the people that he came up with either dead or in prison landscape himself

357
00:18:41.061 --> 00:18:44.420
died of lung cancer on January the 15th, 1983, aged 80.

358
00:18:44.560 --> 00:18:48.780
He enjoyed a rare luxury for those in his line of business by getting to die of

359
00:18:48.781 --> 00:18:52.730
old age and as a free man. So I really hope you found this video. Interesting.
