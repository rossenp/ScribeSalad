1
00:00:00.060 --> 00:00:01.950
<v 0>A singular figure. In many regards,</v>

2
00:00:01.951 --> 00:00:06.150
the Inca bearable Plato is often referred to in Nick dafydd app,

3
00:00:06.180 --> 00:00:07.200
founder of the Academy,

4
00:00:07.230 --> 00:00:10.560
the first institution of higher learning in the Western world and widely

5
00:00:10.561 --> 00:00:13.950
considered the single most influential figure in ancient Greek in Western

6
00:00:13.951 --> 00:00:16.290
philosophy, the mythical state is a Plato,

7
00:00:16.350 --> 00:00:20.670
puts him on a unique pedestal to talk only of his achievements and influence on

8
00:00:20.671 --> 00:00:23.580
humanity. You could occupy a video all on its own. Well,

9
00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:28.500
what man was behind this fabled figure of ancient Greek thought because

10
00:00:28.501 --> 00:00:29.610
Plato's life deeps.

11
00:00:29.611 --> 00:00:34.050
So far back into our past little is known about the society in which he lives

12
00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:37.680
much of what we do know comes from secondary or tertiary sources due to the

13
00:00:37.681 --> 00:00:38.970
sheer magnitude of time,

14
00:00:38.971 --> 00:00:43.170
separating modern man from the ancient Greek world that Peter lived in to

15
00:00:43.171 --> 00:00:45.390
understand the context surrounding Plato's life.

16
00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:49.920
It is perhaps better to understands the men who influenced him and subsequently

17
00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:54.720
the men whom he influenced as well as examining the writers of Plato

18
00:00:54.721 --> 00:00:55.350
himself.

19
00:00:55.350 --> 00:01:00.180
One of Plato's countless famed quotes States saw as the men they grow out of

20
00:01:00.181 --> 00:01:04.200
human characters seems particularly applicable when questioning how best to

21
00:01:04.201 --> 00:01:07.220
understand the ancient world. This allowed to Plato,

22
00:01:07.221 --> 00:01:11.970
the freedom to express all of his magnificent ideas in reading between the lines

23
00:01:11.971 --> 00:01:13.950
of what Plato and his contemporaries left behind.

24
00:01:13.951 --> 00:01:16.680
We can piece together a better understanding of who Plato.

25
00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:21.510
The man really was and begin to peel back the layers of mystery surrounding this

26
00:01:21.511 --> 00:01:22.530
legendary figure.

27
00:01:34.940 --> 00:01:35.870
As I mentioned previously,

28
00:01:35.871 --> 00:01:38.090
the two and a half millennia separating us from Plato.

29
00:01:38.150 --> 00:01:40.370
It makes understanding as world exceedingly difficult,

30
00:01:40.550 --> 00:01:43.910
little is known about plate as early life, as the details have been lost time,

31
00:01:43.911 --> 00:01:45.680
but a smattering of facts remain.

32
00:01:45.890 --> 00:01:49.970
We do know that Plato was born into an influential aristocratic Greek family.

33
00:01:50.030 --> 00:01:54.800
Most scholars believe he was born sometime between 429 and 423 BC and

34
00:01:54.801 --> 00:01:58.790
Athens, approximately coinciding with the start of the Peloponnesian war almost

35
00:01:58.791 --> 00:02:01.310
immediately. The line between fact and fiction blurs,

36
00:02:01.660 --> 00:02:06.290
as some scholars of Plato maintained that his father Aristan of colitis was

37
00:02:06.291 --> 00:02:10.640
descended from Kadra as the ancient King of Athens thirty-one Plato's mother

38
00:02:11.060 --> 00:02:11.061
boasted,

39
00:02:11.061 --> 00:02:14.900
the lineage of equal pedigree pre-teens brother and uncle were both members of a

40
00:02:14.901 --> 00:02:19.240
powerful oligarchy called the 30 tyrants that ruled Athens after its collapsed,

41
00:02:19.250 --> 00:02:21.560
following its defeat and the Peloponnesian war,

42
00:02:21.590 --> 00:02:24.890
because Plato comes from such a prestigious family on both sides.

43
00:02:24.890 --> 00:02:28.640
It is widely agreed upon the play to enjoy the privileged youth when compared to

44
00:02:28.641 --> 00:02:31.070
many fellow Athenians and his noble status,

45
00:02:31.071 --> 00:02:35.450
granted him access to learn from the top pedagogues of ancient Greece.

46
00:02:35.480 --> 00:02:39.140
Plato once wrote the most important part of education is proper training in the

47
00:02:39.141 --> 00:02:44.000
nursery and his upbringing exemplifies this philosophy in the truest sense from

48
00:02:44.001 --> 00:02:44.834
a very young age,

49
00:02:45.080 --> 00:02:48.440
Plato was educated by the best thing cause of his era setting in motion,

50
00:02:48.441 --> 00:02:50.360
a lifetime of seeking learning,

51
00:02:50.361 --> 00:02:53.960
and ultimately spreading his education far beyond himself.

52
00:02:54.050 --> 00:02:57.440
It is believed that Plato had two brothers and a sister, all those,

53
00:02:57.441 --> 00:03:01.690
some argues that the brothers may in fact be uncles as Plato's mention of them

54
00:03:01.691 --> 00:03:02.470
in the Republic.

55
00:03:02.470 --> 00:03:06.280
Doesn't specify Arysta Plato's father died during his childhood,

56
00:03:06.310 --> 00:03:09.520
but the circumstances and year of Ernestine's death are unknown.

57
00:03:09.550 --> 00:03:11.950
Plato is not the famous philosopher's birth name.

58
00:03:12.010 --> 00:03:15.010
Artistically he's is the name given to Plato by his parents.

59
00:03:15.010 --> 00:03:16.750
But sometime during his schooling,

60
00:03:16.780 --> 00:03:21.610
the boy called artistically is adopted the Monica Plato shortened derivative

61
00:03:21.640 --> 00:03:24.220
of the Greek word plat on meaning broad.

62
00:03:24.280 --> 00:03:27.760
While some speculates that his nickname was given in reference to his broad

63
00:03:27.761 --> 00:03:29.950
forehead or the breadth of his knowledge.

64
00:03:30.070 --> 00:03:33.550
There are several accounts of Plato's wrestling coach giving him the nickname in

65
00:03:33.551 --> 00:03:38.080
reference to his broad chest and shoulders later excelled in all areas of his

66
00:03:38.081 --> 00:03:41.410
schooling and historical accounts. Describe him as bright, yet modest.

67
00:03:41.500 --> 00:03:42.940
Even outside of the classroom.

68
00:03:42.941 --> 00:03:46.840
Plato was a formidable figure as he wrestled competitively throughout his youth.

69
00:03:46.930 --> 00:03:51.310
Some even claim that he competed at the Estonian games competition on par with

70
00:03:51.311 --> 00:03:55.780
the ancient Olympics held the summer before and after Olympic gears as part of

71
00:03:55.781 --> 00:03:56.830
the four year yet

72
00:04:03.690 --> 00:04:05.250
You don't understand place. It was a philosopher.

73
00:04:05.251 --> 00:04:09.030
We must first understand the other great thinkers too, influenced his beliefs.

74
00:04:10.060 --> 00:04:12.720
[inaudible] do you have had significant influence on Plato's ideas?

75
00:04:12.900 --> 00:04:14.130
When we think of Pythagoras,

76
00:04:14.131 --> 00:04:18.630
the Pythagorean theorem from Euclidean geometry is what first Springs to mind

77
00:04:18.690 --> 00:04:22.110
most secondary school children have that theorem drilled into their brains.

78
00:04:22.111 --> 00:04:26.430
But what we often overlook is that Pythagoras was well-rounded and scholarly in

79
00:04:26.431 --> 00:04:30.090
several areas of study beyond mathematics by fingers is one of the earliest

80
00:04:30.091 --> 00:04:33.240
Greek proponents of the concept of Madame psychosis,

81
00:04:33.270 --> 00:04:37.230
the belief in trans migration of the soul and in particular,

82
00:04:37.410 --> 00:04:41.670
its reincarnation after one dies by Thacker is also asserted that everything is

83
00:04:41.671 --> 00:04:45.660
numbered and the cosmos can be explained through numerical principles.

84
00:04:45.720 --> 00:04:49.050
Both of these concepts aren't discussed at length in the writings of Plato and

85
00:04:49.230 --> 00:04:52.200
most scholars believe Plato was taught them by thangka.

86
00:04:52.580 --> 00:04:55.110
Rian's the disciples of [inaudible] Cicero,

87
00:04:55.260 --> 00:04:58.260
the famous Roman or razor and philosopher went so far as to state.

88
00:04:58.440 --> 00:05:01.110
They say Plato learned all things by finger Rian.

89
00:05:01.230 --> 00:05:05.100
Aside from Plato's shared metaphysical beliefs with Pythagoras Plato was also an

90
00:05:05.101 --> 00:05:06.390
accomplished mathematics teacher.

91
00:05:06.420 --> 00:05:10.290
One of Plato's mathematic students was Euclid's the father of Euclidean

92
00:05:10.291 --> 00:05:14.130
geometry, Euclidean geometry simply refers to the standard mathematics goals,

93
00:05:14.160 --> 00:05:17.610
geometry still trolls in classrooms or around the world. To this day,

94
00:05:18.180 --> 00:05:21.990
Euclid's also influenced the Pythagorean theorem and his geometry and other sign

95
00:05:21.991 --> 00:05:25.560
that plays out learned from Pythagoras and subsequently passed down his

96
00:05:25.561 --> 00:05:27.420
teachings to his students. Assumptions.

97
00:05:27.421 --> 00:05:31.080
Euclid Plato was also influenced by Heraclitus and Paul manatees,

98
00:05:31.260 --> 00:05:34.860
two philosophers who veered away from the Greek tradition of ancient mythology

99
00:05:34.861 --> 00:05:36.870
and instead focused on metaphysics.

100
00:05:36.900 --> 00:05:40.290
Metaphysics is the branch of philosophy that explores the fundamental truths of

101
00:05:40.291 --> 00:05:40.980
reality.

102
00:05:40.980 --> 00:05:45.090
Most commonly the relationship between mind and matter Hereclitis was of the

103
00:05:45.091 --> 00:05:48.810
belief that all things changed continuously as exemplified best.

104
00:05:48.811 --> 00:05:52.410
There is image of a river with ever-changing waters by amenities on the other

105
00:05:52.710 --> 00:05:56.310
hands argued in favor of the changeless being as he has a shortage.

106
00:05:56.340 --> 00:05:58.520
That all is just an illusion.

107
00:05:58.580 --> 00:06:02.600
The contrast in concepts of change and permanence clearly influenced Plato's

108
00:06:02.601 --> 00:06:06.230
writings best showcased and Plato's theory of forms.

109
00:06:06.500 --> 00:06:07.790
In two of Plato's dialogues,

110
00:06:07.791 --> 00:06:12.050
he portrays Paul manatees debating the nature of permanence and questions,

111
00:06:12.051 --> 00:06:16.370
whether both motion and rest are or whether rest is,

112
00:06:16.430 --> 00:06:21.410
but motion is not the most well-known teacher and influencer of Plato is of

113
00:06:21.411 --> 00:06:21.621
course,

114
00:06:21.621 --> 00:06:25.190
Socrates while scholars debate the precise nature of the relationship between

115
00:06:25.191 --> 00:06:26.180
Plato and Socrates.

116
00:06:26.480 --> 00:06:30.890
It is clear that a young place was a devoted follower of Socrates and

117
00:06:30.891 --> 00:06:34.580
interesting tidbit of note is that Plato never wrote of himself in any of his

118
00:06:34.581 --> 00:06:35.061
writings.

119
00:06:35.061 --> 00:06:39.380
And instead Plato speaks through Socrates in nearly everything he wrote since

120
00:06:39.381 --> 00:06:43.760
Socrates was famed for his irony and the Socratic method of dialogue later used

121
00:06:43.761 --> 00:06:48.560
both irony and Socratic dialogue to not only portray Socrates in a realistic

122
00:06:48.561 --> 00:06:48.950
light,

123
00:06:48.950 --> 00:06:52.760
but also as an effective means to communicate whatever subject he was writing

124
00:06:52.761 --> 00:06:57.380
on. Beta would also often portray Socrates's ignorance yet inquisitive on a

125
00:06:57.381 --> 00:07:01.970
particular subject and in the call and response dialectic style that Plato wrote

126
00:07:01.971 --> 00:07:06.170
in, he would juxtapose this ignorant portrayal of Socrates against a students

127
00:07:06.320 --> 00:07:11.270
claiming to be an expert on a given subject in doing this Socrates often ask

128
00:07:11.271 --> 00:07:15.440
leading questions or provided counter-arguments against the points that the

129
00:07:15.441 --> 00:07:17.780
students of Plato were making in these dialogues.

130
00:07:17.930 --> 00:07:21.800
Thus allowing the students who further explain or reboot the proddings of

131
00:07:21.801 --> 00:07:25.070
Socrates, some scholars criticized Plato for this portrayals,

132
00:07:25.071 --> 00:07:27.980
but since Socrates left, no written works behind.

133
00:07:27.981 --> 00:07:29.600
It is impossible to say with certainty,

134
00:07:29.601 --> 00:07:34.370
whether or not Socrates would play the fool or devil's advocates in reality,

135
00:07:34.371 --> 00:07:38.330
as a means to test a student's resolve or whether this was simply a writing

136
00:07:38.331 --> 00:07:42.740
device used by Plato to clearly convey his message while it appears that Plato

137
00:07:42.741 --> 00:07:46.580
was most strongly influenced by Socrates in many facets of his philosophy,

138
00:07:46.970 --> 00:07:49.250
their ideas did diverge on certain subjects.

139
00:07:49.340 --> 00:07:53.090
Aristotle Plato's most famous students writes of these differences.

140
00:07:53.180 --> 00:07:58.130
He suggests that while Socrates's ideas about forms can be realized through

141
00:07:58.131 --> 00:08:02.690
investigating the natural world Plato's forms exist in a realm outside the

142
00:08:02.691 --> 00:08:05.330
typical breadth of human understanding. However,

143
00:08:05.390 --> 00:08:09.740
in some of Plato's writings that include Socrates Plato portrays his teacher

144
00:08:09.741 --> 00:08:14.360
discussing mystery religions and other mystical concepts because Plato's

145
00:08:14.361 --> 00:08:15.860
writing seemingly contradicts.

146
00:08:15.861 --> 00:08:19.520
Aristotle's claims about the main difference between the philosophies of Plato

147
00:08:19.521 --> 00:08:20.354
and Socrates.

148
00:08:20.540 --> 00:08:25.160
It is impossible to know what Socrates really believed in this aspect of

149
00:08:25.161 --> 00:08:25.880
philosophy.

150
00:08:25.880 --> 00:08:29.660
The relationship between Plato and Socrates has been questioned since ancient

151
00:08:29.661 --> 00:08:31.310
times by countless scholars.

152
00:08:31.340 --> 00:08:35.480
But today there are four main schools of thought about Plato's portrayal of his

153
00:08:35.481 --> 00:08:36.770
most influential teacher.

154
00:08:36.830 --> 00:08:41.480
The theory with the most traction in modern times suggests that Plato's writings

155
00:08:41.481 --> 00:08:42.620
evolved over time.

156
00:08:42.621 --> 00:08:47.120
And so that his earlier writings depicted Socrates as Plato really store him and

157
00:08:47.330 --> 00:08:48.500
just Plato aged.

158
00:08:48.501 --> 00:08:52.610
He increasingly projected his own beliefs onto his portrayal of Socrates.

159
00:08:52.670 --> 00:08:57.000
The relationship between Plato and Socrates is so to scholars because no

160
00:08:57.001 --> 00:08:59.850
writings from Socrates himself have ever been discovered.

161
00:08:59.851 --> 00:09:04.710
So our understanding of Socrates comes almost exclusively from the way Plato

162
00:09:04.860 --> 00:09:07.050
portrays Socrates in his writings.

163
00:09:13.940 --> 00:09:15.710
It was about subjects in many areas,

164
00:09:15.711 --> 00:09:18.320
but he always wrote in the same didactic style,

165
00:09:18.380 --> 00:09:22.940
his didactic style was foremost in a call and response format.

166
00:09:22.941 --> 00:09:27.620
And oftentimes a student debates with Socrates in an intellectual dialogue place

167
00:09:27.710 --> 00:09:30.530
or use this method of communications or flesh out his ideas.

168
00:09:30.531 --> 00:09:31.940
So that counter arguments,

169
00:09:32.000 --> 00:09:36.920
rebuttals and details the mind draw an emotional response were all highlighted.

170
00:09:37.220 --> 00:09:40.280
The area Plato devoted the most attention to was metaphysics.

171
00:09:40.310 --> 00:09:44.210
Metaphysics is a broad philosophical umbrella in which the philosopher attempts

172
00:09:44.211 --> 00:09:48.980
to explain the nature of reality and Plato explored many areas within

173
00:09:49.040 --> 00:09:53.570
its vast expanses. His most famous work is the theory of forms and it's,

174
00:09:53.720 --> 00:09:57.590
he attempts to explain reality through the lens in which Plato perceives it,

175
00:09:57.591 --> 00:09:59.750
using Socrates as his mouthpiece,

176
00:09:59.780 --> 00:10:03.050
but lens through which plays out attempts to understand the world is since been

177
00:10:03.051 --> 00:10:04.400
dubbed Platonism.

178
00:10:04.430 --> 00:10:08.840
And it can best be summarized as denial of reality of the material world,

179
00:10:08.841 --> 00:10:13.340
where the world we can perceive as humans is only a surface image or a

180
00:10:13.341 --> 00:10:17.990
copy of the true world. If this sounds somewhat heady or confusing,

181
00:10:18.170 --> 00:10:18.951
you're not alone.

182
00:10:18.951 --> 00:10:23.630
As Plato spent volumes extrapolating his interpretation of the world around him

183
00:10:24.080 --> 00:10:27.890
in every subject imaginable due to its inherent intricacies.

184
00:10:28.010 --> 00:10:32.120
The first appearance of Plato's explanation of his theory of forms first appears

185
00:10:32.121 --> 00:10:32.871
in the FITO.

186
00:10:32.871 --> 00:10:36.710
One of his most notable works in accordance with this theory of forms.

187
00:10:36.711 --> 00:10:40.760
There exists two worlds and obvious worlds of concrete objects,

188
00:10:40.761 --> 00:10:44.660
such as the grounds. We can see you or other humans.

189
00:10:44.690 --> 00:10:48.950
This world is constantly changing due to our perception changing as well.

190
00:10:49.100 --> 00:10:52.400
The second world is purely conceptual. Then in it,

191
00:10:52.401 --> 00:10:56.330
there are unchanging abstract objects that can only be understood through

192
00:10:56.331 --> 00:10:58.700
speculation or theoretical thought.

193
00:10:58.790 --> 00:11:01.790
Other scholars separate this understanding into three worlds.

194
00:11:01.791 --> 00:11:03.320
The first is material objects.

195
00:11:03.440 --> 00:11:07.550
The second is mental images and the third realm consists of the theoretical

196
00:11:07.551 --> 00:11:09.470
forms that Plato advocates for.

197
00:11:09.710 --> 00:11:13.310
If this is still a bit difficult to wrap your head around then fairness for

198
00:11:13.311 --> 00:11:14.060
scholars.

199
00:11:14.060 --> 00:11:18.020
I spent countless hours attempting to simplify Plato's theory of forms into a

200
00:11:18.021 --> 00:11:20.150
brief palatable explanation.

201
00:11:20.210 --> 00:11:25.010
Unfortunately it seems this has not been attainable for the infinite complex

202
00:11:25.011 --> 00:11:28.430
hypothetical situations that arise from this interpretation of the world has

203
00:11:28.640 --> 00:11:32.930
given many of history's greatest thinkers. Pause it, useful analogy for this.

204
00:11:33.320 --> 00:11:36.470
Maybe the theory of forms are a set of universals that present themselves as a

205
00:11:36.471 --> 00:11:39.500
solution to the problems with universals. For example,

206
00:11:39.501 --> 00:11:41.300
when someone says the word blue,

207
00:11:41.301 --> 00:11:43.670
you have a vision in your head of what blue looks like.

208
00:11:43.790 --> 00:11:47.810
Your idea of blue may differ completely from the person who said blue to you,

209
00:11:48.170 --> 00:11:51.260
but you both know what the other person is referring to. Furthermore,

210
00:11:51.290 --> 00:11:55.270
there are countless shades and variations of blue. Say for instance,

211
00:11:55.271 --> 00:11:59.050
the difference between a deep blue ocean and a light blue sky,

212
00:11:59.140 --> 00:12:01.600
these are both blue. Yes, they are quite different,

213
00:12:01.601 --> 00:12:04.990
but saying blue is an umbrella term that encompasses anything within the color

214
00:12:04.991 --> 00:12:05.470
spectrum.

215
00:12:05.470 --> 00:12:09.250
We have deemed blue scholars have interpreted Plato's theory of forms through

216
00:12:09.280 --> 00:12:11.470
innumerable, other analogies and metaphors.

217
00:12:11.471 --> 00:12:15.970
And it seems each generation of thinkers is a fresh iteration of understanding

218
00:12:15.971 --> 00:12:19.330
Plato's theory. We could go on and on in regards to this matter,

219
00:12:19.331 --> 00:12:22.930
but for the sake of brevity, let's just depart from the topic.

220
00:12:23.020 --> 00:12:26.130
If you're still interested, not more about Plato's theory of forms,

221
00:12:26.131 --> 00:12:28.920
there are literally hundreds of scholarly.

222
00:12:28.921 --> 00:12:32.670
Interpretations of Plato's works that are available for free in public libraries

223
00:12:32.671 --> 00:12:36.600
and in scholarly articles, Socrates and Plato, where unlike in that,

224
00:12:36.630 --> 00:12:40.200
they both believed in the mortality of the soul and in the existence of an

225
00:12:40.201 --> 00:12:43.260
afterlife, applying logic to this concept of an afterlife,

226
00:12:43.290 --> 00:12:47.610
Socrates believed it is safe to assume that it must be a before life as well

227
00:12:47.611 --> 00:12:51.570
because the chances of this current life being your first life and nearly

228
00:12:52.350 --> 00:12:54.330
non-existent applying this concept to the idea of wisdom.

229
00:12:54.360 --> 00:12:57.870
Plato writes of Socrates is often claiming he knows nothing.

230
00:12:57.960 --> 00:13:01.740
Plato goes on to explain that Socrates and himself believe that wisdom does not

231
00:13:01.741 --> 00:13:03.360
come from the world around oneself.

232
00:13:03.480 --> 00:13:06.330
And rather it is the results of divine insight.

233
00:13:06.940 --> 00:13:09.090
The remembrance of before one is born,

234
00:13:09.150 --> 00:13:12.420
instead of the intuitive understanding that we commonly hold in which knowledge

235
00:13:12.421 --> 00:13:15.660
is the result of life experience, understanding and study. In fact,

236
00:13:15.661 --> 00:13:19.890
Socrates takes this concepts to the extents of claiming that reality is

237
00:13:19.891 --> 00:13:22.830
unattainable to those who use the earthly senses.

238
00:13:22.860 --> 00:13:24.810
Plato famously has Socrates assert.

239
00:13:24.930 --> 00:13:29.610
He who sees with his eyes is blind as a facetious reaction to those who claim

240
00:13:29.820 --> 00:13:33.750
that only what can be perceived through their five senses is real and true

241
00:13:33.751 --> 00:13:34.680
Socratic irony.

242
00:13:34.710 --> 00:13:39.480
Socrates often explains that he knows nothing and he refutes all the ascertation

243
00:13:39.630 --> 00:13:43.950
Plato students offer while giving no explanation of his own Plato is perhaps

244
00:13:43.951 --> 00:13:47.790
best known for his allegory stories meant to teach a lesson through metaphor.

245
00:13:47.850 --> 00:13:49.620
If you have ever taken a philosophy class,

246
00:13:49.800 --> 00:13:53.370
then you're likely familiar with at least one of these such as the allegory of

247
00:13:53.371 --> 00:13:57.780
the cave. The allegory is frequently associated with the theory of forms.

248
00:13:57.930 --> 00:14:01.290
As an analogy used to explain the theory and this tale of the cave,

249
00:14:01.291 --> 00:14:04.740
a series of prisoners are tied up in a cave and forced to stare at a wall with a

250
00:14:04.920 --> 00:14:06.210
perpetual fire casting,

251
00:14:06.211 --> 00:14:10.230
shadows on the wall for them to see a group of free men display various objects

252
00:14:10.350 --> 00:14:11.940
that cost shadows on the cave wall.

253
00:14:12.090 --> 00:14:15.210
But the prisoners do not see the shadows of the men themselves.

254
00:14:15.300 --> 00:14:18.630
The men also speak to one another, but they never present themselves.

255
00:14:18.660 --> 00:14:21.030
The prisoners because the prisoners cannot see the men,

256
00:14:21.031 --> 00:14:23.820
but can see the shadow of the objects they holds.

257
00:14:23.821 --> 00:14:27.780
And the prisoners can only hear the men's voices, but again, cannot see them.

258
00:14:27.930 --> 00:14:31.140
The prisoners are made to assume that the noises are coming from the objects,

259
00:14:31.141 --> 00:14:32.730
casting shadows on the wall,

260
00:14:32.850 --> 00:14:36.420
rather than the free men who are effectively invisible to the prisoners.

261
00:14:36.510 --> 00:14:39.450
This represents and Socrates's shared philosophy,

262
00:14:39.451 --> 00:14:42.190
but the world cannot be accepted for the way it is to see.

263
00:14:42.720 --> 00:14:45.690
True reason is the only way to understand the world.

264
00:14:45.750 --> 00:14:48.750
The other most popular errand agree is the ring of giant GS.

265
00:14:48.760 --> 00:14:51.830
The ring of giant GS allows the wearer to become invisible at will.

266
00:14:51.980 --> 00:14:55.610
A series of ethical dilemmas is post the wearer of the ring of giant GS.

267
00:14:55.640 --> 00:14:59.870
But the common theme among them is questioning whether an ordinary just person

268
00:15:00.020 --> 00:15:04.460
would still act morally without fear of negative repercussions or gaining a bad

269
00:15:04.580 --> 00:15:05.413
rep.

270
00:15:11.290 --> 00:15:11.500
<v 3>[Inaudible].</v>

271
00:15:11.500 --> 00:15:12.940
<v 0>Plato did not date his writing.</v>

272
00:15:12.941 --> 00:15:16.180
So it is impossible to know for certain the chronology of his works.

273
00:15:16.300 --> 00:15:20.950
We also are totally unsure of if Plato traveled to study and unsure as to which

274
00:15:20.951 --> 00:15:24.010
lands, if he did travel, some scholars infer from his writing,

275
00:15:24.130 --> 00:15:27.160
that Plato traveled in Italy and in present day, Libya and Egypt,

276
00:15:27.190 --> 00:15:30.370
but no empirical evidence supports these claims. Similarly,

277
00:15:30.400 --> 00:15:32.830
we can only estimate when Plato founded his school,

278
00:15:32.860 --> 00:15:35.650
the Academy likely around age 40, this school,

279
00:15:35.651 --> 00:15:39.190
and later himself would educate many of ancient Greece's other influential

280
00:15:39.191 --> 00:15:42.700
thinkers that succeeded Platos such as Euclid and Aristotle.

281
00:15:42.940 --> 00:15:46.420
The Academy is largely credited as the first Western institution of higher

282
00:15:46.421 --> 00:15:48.370
learning in the world. And it's set in motion,

283
00:15:48.371 --> 00:15:52.090
a tradition of higher institution learning that persists through modernity in

284
00:15:52.091 --> 00:15:52.721
ancient times,

285
00:15:52.721 --> 00:15:56.200
the average life expectancy was much shorter than today due to the lack of

286
00:15:56.201 --> 00:15:58.750
modern medical knowledge and technology. However,

287
00:15:58.810 --> 00:16:01.930
a few wealthy individuals were said to have lived much longer than we would

288
00:16:01.931 --> 00:16:05.890
expect because of that increased access to the limited healthcare of the time.

289
00:16:05.980 --> 00:16:09.580
Plato was one of these such individuals and most accounts of Plato's life,

290
00:16:09.910 --> 00:16:13.330
recounts him living into his eighties while his exact age of death is disputed.

291
00:16:13.331 --> 00:16:17.950
We can say with reasonable certainty that Plato lived to between 81 and

292
00:16:17.980 --> 00:16:18.970
84 years old,

293
00:16:19.030 --> 00:16:22.810
the defenders of explanation is lacking for how a man with such primitive

294
00:16:22.811 --> 00:16:25.630
medical care out to lift his contemporaries by decades,

295
00:16:25.930 --> 00:16:29.920
best access to better healthcare and sanitation due to his aristocratic status

296
00:16:29.921 --> 00:16:33.310
is likely the culprit 23 centuries after his life ended.

297
00:16:33.311 --> 00:16:37.660
Plato's legacy is undeniable as well as directly influencing the generation of

298
00:16:37.661 --> 00:16:41.800
ancient Greek thinkers immediately succeeding him like Kara startle Plato's

299
00:16:41.830 --> 00:16:43.330
impact on Western society.

300
00:16:43.331 --> 00:16:46.660
And the subsequent generations is in comparable place has been studied by

301
00:16:46.661 --> 00:16:50.440
scholars and enlightened desktops continuously since his death.

302
00:16:50.500 --> 00:16:54.310
Many of his ideas are still hotly contested among philosophers and seekers,

303
00:16:54.311 --> 00:16:57.940
and many of the same lessons. Plato taught his students in the Academy.

304
00:16:58.120 --> 00:17:01.240
I taught in Western institutions of higher learning to this date.

305
00:17:01.390 --> 00:17:05.020
It may seem hyperbolic to claim the Plato is Western humanity,

306
00:17:05.050 --> 00:17:06.700
single most influential thinker,

307
00:17:06.880 --> 00:17:11.440
but from mathematics and metaphysics to religion and ethics Plato's philosophy

308
00:17:11.590 --> 00:17:16.420
has molded the minds of millions in comprehensible lengths of time and trickled

309
00:17:16.421 --> 00:17:19.690
down into nearly all aspects of Western society.

310
00:17:20.380 --> 00:17:21.850
