in a bit

7
00:00:19.910 --> 00:00:24.050
Paris, 1979, it's 3:10 PM. On the 2nd of November,

8
00:00:24.410 --> 00:00:25.310
the day of the dead,

9
00:00:25.550 --> 00:00:30.320
a 40 three-year-olds man climbs into a BMW parked outside his flat in port to

10
00:00:30.710 --> 00:00:33.200
Keenan core on the passenger seat. His beautiful girlfriend,

11
00:00:33.201 --> 00:00:34.640
Sylvia is smiling there.

12
00:00:34.700 --> 00:00:38.120
I was leave Paris behind for relaxing holiday in Normandy.

13
00:00:38.180 --> 00:00:41.540
That little dog scoundrel is excited to join them for the trip.

14
00:00:41.780 --> 00:00:43.280
As the man wears his safety belt,

15
00:00:43.281 --> 00:00:46.640
he positions two pieces of hand luggage by his feet carefully, though,

16
00:00:47.090 --> 00:00:50.660
very carefully. They are 200 aides with the safety pins,

17
00:00:50.690 --> 00:00:53.900
partly removed it's 3:14 PM somewhere else,

18
00:00:53.901 --> 00:00:56.990
embarrass police radios crackle, and an order is relate.

19
00:00:57.050 --> 00:01:00.020
The target has been identified and it's time to intervene.

20
00:01:00.140 --> 00:01:04.880
The man in the BMW is jock Mr. Green robber, kidnapper, murderer, Syria,

21
00:01:05.360 --> 00:01:06.770
Nevada, and public enemy. Number one,

22
00:01:06.830 --> 00:01:10.580
he is wanted by the police forces are France, Canada, Spain, and Switzerland.

23
00:01:10.850 --> 00:01:12.950
That man is also Jack mystery,

24
00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:17.180
self appointed rebel one man army against the corruption of the Bosch wall

25
00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:21.650
state, a modern day Robin hood, who only steals from the real thieves banks,

26
00:01:21.770 --> 00:01:22.700
corporations,

27
00:01:22.850 --> 00:01:27.200
and casinos and activist who has been campaigning against the harshness of high

28
00:01:27.201 --> 00:01:32.150
security prisons, whatever the truth about Batman. One thing seems certain.

29
00:01:32.151 --> 00:01:34.880
This will probably be the last minute of his life.

30
00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:42.040
<v 1>Sure.</v>

31
00:01:42.040 --> 00:01:46.580
<v 0>A mystery was born on December the 28th of 1936, second child. Yeah.</v>

32
00:01:46.610 --> 00:01:50.240
And Monique who were small time entrepreneurs in the textile sector,

33
00:01:50.330 --> 00:01:54.890
the early is of Jack or Jackie is his father called him happy and uneventful

34
00:01:55.070 --> 00:01:57.470
until that spring of 1940, in which he,

35
00:01:57.770 --> 00:02:02.750
his family and his country suffered the trauma of the German invasion PO was

36
00:02:02.751 --> 00:02:06.530
captured and sent to a pow camp in Germany. Meanwhile, Mooney, you can,

37
00:02:06.531 --> 00:02:11.510
the children had to evacuate the house and here suburban Paris and relocate to

38
00:02:11.511 --> 00:02:12.344
the countryside.

39
00:02:12.350 --> 00:02:17.090
Jackie spent the occupation years at a farm near PTA owned by relatives.

40
00:02:17.120 --> 00:02:18.410
He soon found out that this farm,

41
00:02:18.500 --> 00:02:21.760
it was a part of the resistance and Jackie was allowed to attend the partisans

42
00:02:21.761 --> 00:02:25.580
secret meetings. At night by day, he played soldier with his friends.

43
00:02:25.670 --> 00:02:29.450
It was in this environment that he developed a taste for guns after D-Day.

44
00:02:29.540 --> 00:02:32.810
He witnessed resistance fighters, ambushing or retreating German column,

45
00:02:32.811 --> 00:02:34.580
not far from the farm, the following day,

46
00:02:34.610 --> 00:02:37.550
Jackie and two sister found a bloody mangled corpse by the road.

47
00:02:37.790 --> 00:02:40.910
This was his first direct encounter with death,

48
00:02:40.940 --> 00:02:43.130
which actually didn't shock him at all.

49
00:02:43.280 --> 00:02:47.150
Some days later he would experience another first. The partisans had rounded up.

50
00:02:47.151 --> 00:02:49.490
Some women accused of collaborating with the Germans,

51
00:02:49.491 --> 00:02:53.150
or sometimes just accused of being sexually or romantically involved with them.

52
00:02:53.270 --> 00:02:57.140
Their hat was Shaun or their faces beaten. Jackie stared at one of them,

53
00:02:57.170 --> 00:02:59.680
a fighter had painted a swastika on her forehead.

54
00:02:59.740 --> 00:03:02.080
This woman became the target of the partisans, wrath.

55
00:03:02.110 --> 00:03:06.130
They with the butt of their rifles and they eventually killed tap in the

56
00:03:06.131 --> 00:03:08.050
process. Her dress was ripped open.

57
00:03:08.170 --> 00:03:11.740
Mr. Green later recalled this as his first experience with female nudity.

58
00:03:11.741 --> 00:03:14.410
And it was definitely more traumatic than the corporate.

59
00:03:14.500 --> 00:03:18.280
He had seen a few days earlier after the war was over. Jackie returned to Paris,

60
00:03:18.281 --> 00:03:20.890
happy to be rejoined by his father. Soon, afterwards,

61
00:03:20.950 --> 00:03:22.690
some sense of normalcy had returned,

62
00:03:22.691 --> 00:03:26.050
but Jackie could not adapt to the daily routine of going to school.

63
00:03:26.051 --> 00:03:28.810
After years of freedom at the farmhouse, he played truant.

64
00:03:28.811 --> 00:03:31.690
Most of the time ignored homework and became the boss of a gang of street

65
00:03:31.691 --> 00:03:33.340
urchins. By his teenage years,

66
00:03:33.370 --> 00:03:36.910
Jackie had been expelled from two high schools on one occasion for punching the

67
00:03:36.911 --> 00:03:39.400
headmaster by the age of 15 Jackie's dad had,

68
00:03:39.401 --> 00:03:41.290
why isn't he decided to get him an apprenticeship?

69
00:03:41.500 --> 00:03:44.170
Because studying was certainly not his strong suit.

70
00:03:44.350 --> 00:03:47.320
Jackie worked for a couple of years at a fashion designers workshop,

71
00:03:47.350 --> 00:03:50.740
even doing some errands for celebrities like Audrey happen. At the same time,

72
00:03:50.770 --> 00:03:53.140
Jackie was staging his first burglaries with the friends.

73
00:03:53.350 --> 00:03:56.800
His favorite technique was to end to middle-class flats disguised as flat

74
00:03:56.801 --> 00:04:00.460
delivery boys. During this period, Jackie lost his virginity to an older woman,

75
00:04:00.490 --> 00:04:02.860
a prostitute named Sarah and his memoirs.

76
00:04:02.861 --> 00:04:05.050
He admitted that upon seeing her undressed,

77
00:04:05.051 --> 00:04:09.070
he thought about the collaborationist woman who had been killed by the partisans

78
00:04:09.220 --> 00:04:11.500
for two years. Jackie was smitten with Sarah,

79
00:04:11.530 --> 00:04:16.210
even trying to get her out of prostitution, but eventually it at the age of 18,

80
00:04:16.240 --> 00:04:17.440
he was too distracted.

81
00:04:17.500 --> 00:04:21.700
First by his criminal career runs Zen by a young student from Martinique named

82
00:04:21.880 --> 00:04:26.410
Lydia to Souza. The two had mounted a party at the city university or in Paris.

83
00:04:26.560 --> 00:04:31.270
The sexual attraction had been strong intermediate. So in 1955 at the age of 19,

84
00:04:31.271 --> 00:04:32.770
Jackie and Lydia got married.

85
00:04:33.040 --> 00:04:36.310
The wedding had been accelerated by the fact that the DIA was pregnant,

86
00:04:36.340 --> 00:04:38.740
but not with Jackie's child. Nonetheless,

87
00:04:38.920 --> 00:04:41.170
the young Berger acknowledged the child as his own.

88
00:04:41.380 --> 00:04:44.290
Probably not a great start for a relationship. In fact,

89
00:04:44.740 --> 00:04:47.710
their marriage was not happy. One video had frequent affairs,

90
00:04:47.711 --> 00:04:51.640
which also had the title of Saint slot. And Mr. Green's memoirs,

91
00:04:51.730 --> 00:04:54.940
Jackie was unhappy. He took to the bottle and became physically abusive.

92
00:04:55.300 --> 00:04:58.270
They jumped at the occasions and leave it all behind when the French army

93
00:04:58.271 --> 00:05:00.850
conscripted him in 1956, the following year,

94
00:05:00.880 --> 00:05:04.930
the couple divorced and Jackie volunteered to serve in Algeria training as a

95
00:05:04.931 --> 00:05:07.870
paratrooper and command date. Finally, his love of adventure,

96
00:05:07.900 --> 00:05:11.620
his passion for guns and his simmering desire for violence would all be

97
00:05:11.621 --> 00:05:13.090
satisfied at the time.

98
00:05:13.091 --> 00:05:17.050
The French military was waging a bitter dirty war against the Algerian national

99
00:05:17.051 --> 00:05:21.940
liberation front, struggling for independence. Jackie, the boy was no more.

100
00:05:22.390 --> 00:05:24.130
It was Jack the soldier.

101
00:05:24.131 --> 00:05:27.640
Now he volunteered for the special anti gorilla actions and duties,

102
00:05:27.641 --> 00:05:29.920
which included some pretty dangerous combat missions.

103
00:05:30.250 --> 00:05:34.060
He also assisted the military police in torturing members of deliberation runs

104
00:05:34.061 --> 00:05:37.750
or even worse, executing them with a bullet to the head in his memoirs.

105
00:05:37.750 --> 00:05:41.650
He admitted to holding a blind to hatred towards Algeria and fighters there.

106
00:05:41.660 --> 00:05:42.371
On one occasion,

107
00:05:42.371 --> 00:05:46.150
he defied his sergeant's orders by releasing three Algerian prisoners.

108
00:05:46.210 --> 00:05:50.890
One of the major only eight reminded him of his youngest self and Nazi occupied

109
00:05:50.891 --> 00:05:54.490
France throughout the Algerian period. Jack lied to his parents,

110
00:05:54.491 --> 00:05:55.480
telling them this.

111
00:05:55.720 --> 00:06:00.140
He had been stationed in an away from combat when he was demobbed in April,

112
00:06:00.140 --> 00:06:02.420
1959, his father was surprised to see a military CrossFit,

113
00:06:02.421 --> 00:06:06.080
bravery pinned on his chest. Mr. Green was dead proud of his son,

114
00:06:06.081 --> 00:06:08.180
but he also knew that the conflict was changing him.

115
00:06:08.480 --> 00:06:12.320
He later admitted that Jack was never the same. After returning from Algeria,

116
00:06:12.410 --> 00:06:15.650
something had cracked incite him and a new persona.

117
00:06:15.710 --> 00:06:18.110
It emerged something that was dangerous.

118
00:06:18.520 --> 00:06:19.353
<v 1>Yes.</v>

119
00:06:24.900 --> 00:06:25.733
Around Jerry. Yeah.

120
00:06:25.910 --> 00:06:29.620
<v 0>Sounds returns. Civilian life board, Jack death. He craves adrenaline,</v>

121
00:06:29.740 --> 00:06:31.510
whatever the sauce. Initially,

122
00:06:31.540 --> 00:06:35.020
misery and gravitated towards political violence and terrorism by day,

123
00:06:35.050 --> 00:06:37.350
he worked as a textile salesman by night,

124
00:06:37.570 --> 00:06:41.320
see frequency members of the OAS organization of the secret army.

125
00:06:41.440 --> 00:06:45.580
This group violently opposed president goal's policy to grant independence to

126
00:06:45.581 --> 00:06:48.910
Algeria. But Jack's preference was for ordinary crime.

127
00:06:49.090 --> 00:06:52.510
He spends his nights committing small burglaries and playing poker in this

128
00:06:52.511 --> 00:06:55.540
period. He partnered with an accomplice known as Gita, the Sicilian,

129
00:06:55.541 --> 00:06:59.620
who would Manzur him towards more serious crimes. In 1959,

130
00:06:59.621 --> 00:07:02.950
he was committed of his first serious burglary in the flat of a wealthy

131
00:07:03.550 --> 00:07:06.580
businessman. As he was boring. His way into a safe is drilled breakdown.

132
00:07:06.850 --> 00:07:09.670
Jack left broke into a hardware store, stolen, other drill,

133
00:07:09.671 --> 00:07:12.280
and went back to finish the job during the same period.

134
00:07:12.281 --> 00:07:15.490
He committed his first cold-blooded murder on a nice house with.

135
00:07:15.890 --> 00:07:18.430
Jack had run into Sarah has old flame.

136
00:07:18.460 --> 00:07:20.020
That was a violent altercation with Sarah,

137
00:07:20.021 --> 00:07:24.670
his new boyfriend and pimp and Arab Madden and Ahmed Jacques enter the fight by

138
00:07:24.880 --> 00:07:27.730
pistol with him the morning after argument beat up Sarah,

139
00:07:27.760 --> 00:07:29.860
trying to extract Jack's address from Huck.

140
00:07:30.040 --> 00:07:33.700
When Jack and Gita found out they kidnapped Ahmed and led him to the woods

141
00:07:33.701 --> 00:07:35.560
outside Paris. They stripped him naked.

142
00:07:35.800 --> 00:07:40.480
And then Jack slowly stabbed them to death with his Algerian souvenir of 15

143
00:07:40.481 --> 00:07:43.360
centimeter dagga Jack, who was starting to build a reputation,

144
00:07:43.361 --> 00:07:47.620
both in the underworld and among the police and the summer of 1960 after yet

145
00:07:47.621 --> 00:07:51.460
another burglary Jack and two of his accomplices went to Spain to lay low there.

146
00:07:51.461 --> 00:07:55.240
They were settled and tell us that Damar on the cost of Bravo one night,

147
00:07:55.660 --> 00:07:59.920
Jack hooks up with a local girl, Maria Solidad. The two were an unlikely match.

148
00:07:59.950 --> 00:08:02.320
Jack was brash venturous ladies, man,

149
00:08:03.070 --> 00:08:07.300
Solidad was shy still under tight supervision from a parents and the Virgin.

150
00:08:07.390 --> 00:08:10.540
Well, at least until she had met shock off to this on the holidays,

151
00:08:10.810 --> 00:08:13.180
Jack and his friends returned to their old habits in Paris,

152
00:08:13.390 --> 00:08:15.760
but this life was bound to be erupted erupted.

153
00:08:15.790 --> 00:08:19.750
When an unexpected visitor knocked a Jack's door, it was solid Solidad.

154
00:08:19.870 --> 00:08:22.480
She had gotten pregnant during their fat defining a patterns.

155
00:08:22.481 --> 00:08:25.990
She had left home to move in with Jack and Paris, the two married.

156
00:08:26.140 --> 00:08:29.140
So I'll November the fourth, 1961, and went on to have three children.

157
00:08:29.260 --> 00:08:33.580
Sabrina borrows and Bruno fatherhood did not determine mastery in from crime in

158
00:08:33.581 --> 00:08:34.690
January, 1962,

159
00:08:34.691 --> 00:08:38.770
he was arrested on counts of burglary and carrying a concealed firearm receiving

160
00:08:38.771 --> 00:08:40.840
an 18 month sentence. After serving as done,

161
00:08:41.140 --> 00:08:43.600
Jack made a serious attempt to lead an honest life.

162
00:08:43.840 --> 00:08:46.360
It first joins an interior design firm as an apprentice,

163
00:08:46.480 --> 00:08:49.060
working hard and showing a real knack for architecture.

164
00:08:49.120 --> 00:08:52.750
It was a busy then the firm made them redundance after less than a year.

165
00:08:52.990 --> 00:08:57.000
Next solid dad's family had tried to help offering him that management position,

166
00:08:57.001 --> 00:08:58.710
where they hotel in the North of France.

167
00:08:58.711 --> 00:09:01.890
But the establishment soon became the meeting spot for local criminals.

168
00:09:01.891 --> 00:09:06.060
And [inaudible] went back to his old habits around this period.

169
00:09:06.061 --> 00:09:07.500
He made an important discovery.

170
00:09:07.620 --> 00:09:11.490
It took very little to ultra his likeness pair of glasses, a hat or a wig,

171
00:09:11.491 --> 00:09:15.300
a beard it's just a single detail could make an unrecognizable.

172
00:09:15.390 --> 00:09:19.020
Mr. Green would exploit this talent for future criminal endeavors. Meanwhile,

173
00:09:19.021 --> 00:09:22.500
Solidad patiently waited at home unaware that her husband had developed a

174
00:09:22.501 --> 00:09:25.800
relationship with another woman, a prostitute, good GN,

175
00:09:25.801 --> 00:09:30.630
Schneider known as Janno in times, you know, became more than a lover to misery.

176
00:09:30.750 --> 00:09:33.810
And she was the second wife to him and an invaluable accomplice.

177
00:09:34.080 --> 00:09:37.470
He introduced her to his old men taquito and even to his father,

178
00:09:37.560 --> 00:09:40.440
both gave their blessing to that relationship. One night,

179
00:09:40.950 --> 00:09:42.840
Juno was hanging out in Mr. Green's hotel.

180
00:09:42.841 --> 00:09:44.910
When the bar was raided by a gang of thugs,

181
00:09:45.060 --> 00:09:46.410
Mr. [inaudible] confronted the leader,

182
00:09:46.440 --> 00:09:49.830
knocking him out with a truncheon without missing a beat unholstered,

183
00:09:49.831 --> 00:09:52.380
a 38 handgun and kept the rest of the gang at Bay.

184
00:09:52.500 --> 00:09:55.980
Apparently these were two criminal souls who were just meant for each other.

185
00:09:56.250 --> 00:09:58.860
And let me tell you about something that was meant for you.

the world. I know that can be daunting because it's scary to pursue new things,

192

<v 1>The next appointment.</v>

210
00:11:18.670 --> 00:11:21.290
<v 0>And Mr. Green's criminal resume is the most puzzling one.</v>

211
00:11:21.410 --> 00:11:26.180
On the 2nd of December, 1965, he was arrested in Palmer, dummy Yorker in Spain,

212
00:11:26.240 --> 00:11:30.140
as he was trying to steal confidential documents from the office of the military

213
00:11:30.141 --> 00:11:33.020
governor in his memoirs, Mr. [inaudible] claims that this was a job.

214
00:11:33.021 --> 00:11:36.800
Somebody had commissioned ghetto to do the Sicilian as well as him,

215
00:11:36.801 --> 00:11:38.120
but really who knows?

216
00:11:38.121 --> 00:11:42.440
It's not clear the Lamar's newspaper speculates that this job may have been

217
00:11:42.441 --> 00:11:44.750
linked to Mr. Green's old days with the OAS,

218
00:11:44.751 --> 00:11:47.390
the antidote terrorists in the mid 1960s,

219
00:11:47.391 --> 00:11:51.200
many former OAS members were hiding in Spain with protection from Francisco

220
00:11:51.620 --> 00:11:52.250
Franco's military.

221
00:11:52.250 --> 00:11:56.440
The Palmer heist may have even been ordered by the DRM French military

222
00:11:56.441 --> 00:12:00.540
intelligence to retrieve a list of OAS, subversives and axle. Mr. Green,

223
00:12:00.541 --> 00:12:04.560
the gangster has a government agents and interesting theory is supported by what

224
00:12:04.740 --> 00:12:06.600
happened next. After his arrest, Mr.

225
00:12:06.600 --> 00:12:09.840
Green was transferred to the French embassy and Madrid repatriated and given a

226
00:12:09.841 --> 00:12:13.170
very lenient sentence in October of 1966,

227
00:12:13.171 --> 00:12:17.160
Mr. Green gave it another go at honesty and opened a restaurant in the Canary

228
00:12:17.161 --> 00:12:20.730
islands. Solidad was with him to recover that relationship.

229
00:12:20.790 --> 00:12:24.660
The project failed miserably and the couple eventually divorced in 1967.

230
00:12:25.080 --> 00:12:27.000
Shark and Jenner became the permanent item. Men,

231
00:12:27.210 --> 00:12:30.060
both life ends in crime in November.

232
00:12:30.090 --> 00:12:33.450
They first attracted the attention of the special squads of the French judiciary

233
00:12:33.451 --> 00:12:34.284
police. The two,

234
00:12:34.620 --> 00:12:39.240
a luxury hotel in Chamonix in the absence briefly held a Tennessean businessmen

235
00:12:39.241 --> 00:12:41.370
at ransom after extorting a large sum.

236
00:12:41.371 --> 00:12:44.400
The two lived on the run for three months with the police on their backs,

237
00:12:44.430 --> 00:12:48.390
Mr. Green and Juno decided to leave the country for good. On February the sixth,

238
00:12:48.391 --> 00:12:51.450
1968, they took off from Orly airport,

239
00:12:51.810 --> 00:12:55.590
destination Quebec from February to June of 1968.

240
00:12:55.620 --> 00:12:59.610
The couple were employed as Schaeffer and housekeeper by a Montreal millionaire,

241
00:12:59.640 --> 00:13:03.600
George [inaudible], but after rounds with other staff, that was sad.

242
00:13:04.050 --> 00:13:05.550
No job though. No problem,

243
00:13:05.610 --> 00:13:08.130
Mr. [inaudible] kidnapped the millionaire asking for 800,

244
00:13:08.131 --> 00:13:10.500
a hundred thousand dollars ransom after cashing in the loot.

245
00:13:10.560 --> 00:13:14.220
The couple laid low for several months as guests of a widow who they preferred

246
00:13:14.221 --> 00:13:14.700
it.

247
00:13:14.700 --> 00:13:18.110
A couple tried to escape to the U S but were caught in Arkansas and extradited

248
00:13:18.111 --> 00:13:21.330
to Canada around July the 16th, 1969,

249
00:13:21.480 --> 00:13:24.600
Jack and Regina were both incarcerated. They were charged with kidnapping,

250
00:13:24.601 --> 00:13:27.540
the Montreal millionaire, but also with murdering their friends.

251
00:13:27.541 --> 00:13:31.230
The widow a body had been found on June the 30th strangled.

252
00:13:31.350 --> 00:13:32.850
They were eventually acquitted of the murder,

253
00:13:32.880 --> 00:13:36.480
but the outrage at this job prompted mystery into stage.

254
00:13:36.510 --> 00:13:39.480
His first in a series of jail breaks on August the 17th,

255
00:13:39.510 --> 00:13:42.810
the managed to capture a prison warden after stealing his uniform and keys

256
00:13:43.130 --> 00:13:45.600
shocked them, proceeded to free his lover. Unfortunately for them,

257
00:13:45.601 --> 00:13:47.070
they record the very next day.

258
00:13:47.071 --> 00:13:49.530
And Mr. Green was sent to a high security prison St.

259
00:13:49.531 --> 00:13:51.840
Vincent de Paul and Laval West of Ottawa.

260
00:13:51.900 --> 00:13:55.500
Mr. Green now took his time to plan the next escape. Over the next three years,

261
00:13:55.501 --> 00:13:59.340
he recruited a team of five accomplices and to create a secret stash of pools

262
00:13:59.341 --> 00:14:02.850
from the prison workshop. Finally on August the 21st, 1972, Mr.

263
00:14:03.060 --> 00:14:05.100
Green led his fellow inmates in a daring escape,

264
00:14:05.280 --> 00:14:07.920
cutting through several fences with the tools he had stolen.

265
00:14:08.010 --> 00:14:10.380
Once outside the permits at the six escapees,

266
00:14:10.381 --> 00:14:13.620
simply flanks down some cars and hitched a ride to freedom.

267
00:14:13.740 --> 00:14:16.560
Mr. Green had now partnered with one of the escaped convict.

268
00:14:16.740 --> 00:14:20.730
So violent gangster called [inaudible] over the ensuing 10 days,

269
00:14:20.731 --> 00:14:23.610
the two attacked three banks robbing them a total of four time.

270
00:14:23.700 --> 00:14:26.490
On the 26th of August, they held up to small town banks,

271
00:14:26.491 --> 00:14:28.620
10 minutes apart from each other on the 28th,

272
00:14:28.621 --> 00:14:31.380
they raided a bank in Montreal as Mr. Green did not like that.

273
00:14:31.620 --> 00:14:35.130
Funny look from one of the shares. They returned three days later for a second.

274
00:14:35.550 --> 00:14:37.290
Ticed with the pockets full of cash and weapons.

275
00:14:37.320 --> 00:14:40.140
Mr. Rena mercy eight went one step further. On the 3rd of September,

276
00:14:40.200 --> 00:14:42.060
they attacked the old prison St.

277
00:14:42.540 --> 00:14:45.000
Vincent to free some of that old friends still inside.

278
00:14:45.150 --> 00:14:47.940
As they started the assault, they were caught between a rock and a hard place.

279
00:14:48.150 --> 00:14:50.340
Wardens were shooting from the prison walls.

280
00:14:50.341 --> 00:14:54.920
And two police cars arrived as reinforcements shock and Sean pool unleashed an

281
00:14:54.921 --> 00:14:58.700
Inferno of gunfire green successfully hit the police scarves severely wounded.

282
00:14:58.790 --> 00:15:02.030
The two officers inside mercy eight kept the prison staff at Bay until the

283
00:15:02.031 --> 00:15:04.730
bullet caught him in the leg. Our numbers in almost down to the ammo,

284
00:15:04.770 --> 00:15:08.510
the two jumps back in the car and sped off hounded by every police officer in

285
00:15:08.511 --> 00:15:11.300
Quebec that DUI sought refuge in the woods for a week.

286
00:15:11.300 --> 00:15:14.750
They were undisturbed until they killed two forest gods who had mistaken them

287
00:15:14.830 --> 00:15:19.580
for poachers, you know, in the interim. Well, she was still in jail and Mr.

288
00:15:19.820 --> 00:15:23.360
Green had made plans to spring hub, but when Jack informed her of his plan,

289
00:15:23.361 --> 00:15:25.340
she Austin not to follow through on it.

290
00:15:25.400 --> 00:15:28.340
Vaginosis specter that the police would lay a trap it up prison.

291
00:15:28.341 --> 00:15:30.110
And she didn't want him to get caught.

292
00:15:30.230 --> 00:15:33.140
Thus Jeno sacrificed lost Johns to see him stream.

293
00:15:33.560 --> 00:15:35.270
And the two would never meet again. Mr. Rena,

294
00:15:35.570 --> 00:15:37.730
I continued that robbing spree throughout October,

295
00:15:37.731 --> 00:15:39.920
November and December of 1972, the two,

296
00:15:39.980 --> 00:15:42.830
especially Shocket become national celebrities and counted,

297
00:15:42.831 --> 00:15:46.400
or even if it came with a dark reputation for murder and violent heists along

298
00:15:46.401 --> 00:15:49.190
the way, Mr. Green even picked up a groupie of sorts,

299
00:15:49.730 --> 00:15:52.160
Joyce to rash this new lover followed him everywhere.

300
00:15:52.190 --> 00:15:55.100
When he eventually decided to flee from Canada and return to France,

301
00:15:55.280 --> 00:15:57.110
she followed him. He's in his lane.

302
00:16:03.880 --> 00:16:05.200
So in 1973,

303
00:16:05.201 --> 00:16:08.680
Mr. Green was back in France and up to his old tricks on March the fifth,

304
00:16:08.681 --> 00:16:12.380
he wounded a police officer after a violent quarrel with a cashier at a bar,

305
00:16:12.381 --> 00:16:14.200
a mistake that would cost him his freedom.

306
00:16:14.290 --> 00:16:17.740
He was arrested on the eighth and scheduled to appear before a judge months

307
00:16:17.741 --> 00:16:21.400
later on June the sixth at the courthouse in company Northwest of Paris,

308
00:16:21.610 --> 00:16:25.060
as his charges were being read, Mr. And produced a gun stuffed in his belt,

309
00:16:25.150 --> 00:16:28.030
he had retrieved it from the toilets were unaccomplished. So left it for him.

310
00:16:28.090 --> 00:16:30.550
This was Mr. Green at his most brazen.

311
00:16:30.580 --> 00:16:33.160
He held the judge at gunpoint and using him as a human shield.

312
00:16:33.161 --> 00:16:34.660
He walked free of the tribunal.

313
00:16:34.690 --> 00:16:37.840
That's the moment when Mr. And the gangster became a celebrity yeah.

314
00:16:38.080 --> 00:16:41.410
Household name. It's also when authorities the plant in public enemy.

315
00:16:41.411 --> 00:16:42.244
Number one,

316
00:16:42.320 --> 00:16:45.610
as the ministry of the interior created a special squad headed by a comma San

317
00:16:45.790 --> 00:16:47.770
role, chief inspector, Roberto Broussard,

318
00:16:48.070 --> 00:16:52.630
Jack had found his nemesis Broussard and his colleague said a great opportunity

319
00:16:52.631 --> 00:16:56.170
to catch a mystery. And September of 1973, on the 28th,

320
00:16:56.200 --> 00:16:57.970
the gangster performed his signature mover,

321
00:16:58.150 --> 00:17:00.190
double armed robbery of two adjacent banks.

322
00:17:00.220 --> 00:17:03.520
Mr. And his gang made their getaway pockets loaded with cash bus.

323
00:17:03.550 --> 00:17:06.790
It was close school. The police arrived in force and managed to arrest.

324
00:17:06.791 --> 00:17:07.840
One of the gang's drivers.

325
00:17:07.900 --> 00:17:10.540
The squad pressured the driver until they had an address.

326
00:17:10.600 --> 00:17:12.460
The day off to Brasov squad surrounds him Mr.

327
00:17:12.700 --> 00:17:14.590
Green's flats and forced him to surrender. Jack,

328
00:17:14.591 --> 00:17:18.940
Mr. Green was again behind bars and they weren't keeping him at just any old

329
00:17:18.970 --> 00:17:19.480
jail.

330
00:17:19.480 --> 00:17:22.960
He was sentenced to spend a term of 20 years inside the high security wing of

331
00:17:22.961 --> 00:17:23.800
Lasante prison.

332
00:17:24.040 --> 00:17:27.430
This was a harsh institution placed in the heart of Paris and plagued by

333
00:17:27.431 --> 00:17:30.700
overcrowding sexual violence and, um, sanitary conditions.

334
00:17:30.790 --> 00:17:33.940
During the following five years at Lasante mystery and created a new public

335
00:17:33.941 --> 00:17:37.690
persona for himself sharks. The gangster became Jack, the gentleman robber,

336
00:17:37.720 --> 00:17:41.320
who only struck at the rich and powerful, but never Holmes.

337
00:17:41.320 --> 00:17:43.570
That is a guy on the street. He became jock,

338
00:17:43.600 --> 00:17:47.290
the activist who criticized the corruption of the government and the inhumane

339
00:17:47.291 --> 00:17:49.300
conditions of the QHS.

340
00:17:49.380 --> 00:17:52.770
These were the highest security wings in which convicts rotted in solitary

341
00:17:52.771 --> 00:17:53.604
confinement.

342
00:17:53.670 --> 00:17:57.120
As such Mr. Green became the darling of the media and the ultra laughed.

343
00:17:57.180 --> 00:18:01.470
Mr. Green also took the time to write his autobiography instinct of death in the

344
00:18:01.890 --> 00:18:05.250
bookkeeper reemphasized. How many of his actions while ideologically motivated?

345
00:18:05.251 --> 00:18:09.540
Although he admitted that his pursuit of a life of crime was tied to his love of

346
00:18:09.541 --> 00:18:13.590
risk and adrenaline. This is why he defined himself as a kamikaze of crime.

347
00:18:13.830 --> 00:18:17.460
He also claims to have killed 39 people, which was probably an exaggeration,

348
00:18:17.490 --> 00:18:20.370
but he did offer very precise details on some of these murders.

349
00:18:20.460 --> 00:18:21.810
Instinct of death, of course,

350
00:18:21.811 --> 00:18:25.530
was published prior to one of the most spectacular chapters of Mr. Green's life.

351
00:18:26.010 --> 00:18:26.843
His escape from them,

352
00:18:33.290 --> 00:18:36.920
Mr. Green's time in QA chess was not as harsh as he depicted.

353
00:18:37.130 --> 00:18:40.220
He could count on the friendship of many convicts and even warden who had

354
00:18:40.221 --> 00:18:42.500
smuggled cigars and other luxury goods in for him.

355
00:18:42.650 --> 00:18:45.740
One of these wardens offered to help mystery and escape from the Sansei.

356
00:18:45.830 --> 00:18:49.430
The man took several deep of the keys to the prison cells and smuggled them to

357
00:18:49.670 --> 00:18:52.100
Mr. Green, along with two handguns tear gas,

358
00:18:52.101 --> 00:18:55.490
canisters Pence's mountaineering rope, and a grappling hook.

359
00:18:55.580 --> 00:18:58.940
Mr. Renin does accomplish dash the items inside the ventilation system of the

360
00:18:58.941 --> 00:19:02.540
consultation rooms designed for lawyers to meet with their convict plants,

361
00:19:02.720 --> 00:19:04.010
to protect them from humidity.

362
00:19:04.040 --> 00:19:06.770
He wrapped each object with socks and rubber gloves.

363
00:19:06.860 --> 00:19:09.980
And now we come to the time of the 8th of May, 1978,

364
00:19:10.010 --> 00:19:13.400
Mr. Green is taken by gods into a consultation room to meet his liar.

365
00:19:13.520 --> 00:19:16.220
As soon as they are alone, he orders her to stay silence.

366
00:19:16.230 --> 00:19:20.090
And then he retrieves this tool from the aeration Vance guns in hands, mystery,

367
00:19:20.180 --> 00:19:23.450
and quickly holds up some of the gods. One of them is the deputy chief warden,

368
00:19:23.510 --> 00:19:25.730
Mr. Haynes strips him naked and wears his uniform.

369
00:19:25.820 --> 00:19:28.640
Now the gangster locks them all up inside the consultation room,

370
00:19:28.641 --> 00:19:32.780
then proceeds to free two more convicts, Francois Bessie, and common Reeves.

371
00:19:32.840 --> 00:19:35.720
The trio lower themselves into a courtyard with the climbing rope.

372
00:19:35.780 --> 00:19:37.970
They are expecting to see only at fellow inmates,

373
00:19:37.971 --> 00:19:40.730
but they stumbled upon a group of guards and building contractors.

374
00:19:40.940 --> 00:19:44.690
Mr. Green holds them at gunpoint and the tree moves on to clear the next

375
00:19:44.691 --> 00:19:47.360
obstacle, the perimeter wall on the walkway. It's off the wall. Look,

376
00:19:47.361 --> 00:19:49.430
God is keeping watch with a rifle, Mr. Ian,

377
00:19:49.431 --> 00:19:51.920
incapacitates him with tear gas and then grabs his gun.

378
00:19:52.070 --> 00:19:55.460
All the gods that are now in alerts and that firing against them mystery and

379
00:19:55.461 --> 00:19:58.700
exchange has gunfire with the gods as best a lowers himself onto the street,

380
00:19:58.701 --> 00:20:01.730
outside the prison, the bandit, then hands over the rifle to Reeves.

381
00:20:01.790 --> 00:20:04.700
It's his time to climb down to freedom to is next,

382
00:20:04.701 --> 00:20:07.880
but he loses his grip on the climbing rope and crashes into some scaffolding,

383
00:20:07.881 --> 00:20:11.720
seven meters below, which is a bad fold, but he makes it out alive.

384
00:20:11.810 --> 00:20:15.260
Now police reinforcements arrived as Reeves tries to stand up.

385
00:20:15.261 --> 00:20:19.250
An officer shoots him, killing him instantly. Mr. Greene is ready to fire back,

386
00:20:19.251 --> 00:20:21.800
but his gun jams, this ultimately AIDS his escape,

387
00:20:21.830 --> 00:20:25.940
the police seeing his uniform confused and hesitate to shoot back seizing the

388
00:20:25.941 --> 00:20:30.860
moment Mr. [inaudible] shoving the driver routes and they speed off.

389
00:20:30.980 --> 00:20:33.890
This was the first ever successful escape from the Suntech. Mr.

390
00:20:33.891 --> 00:20:36.290
Green was dangerously close though, to becoming a legend.

391
00:20:43.280 --> 00:20:46.040
Any gangster would lay low and stay quiet for a while.

392
00:20:46.041 --> 00:20:49.060
But Mr. Green was not any gangster on July the 27th,

393
00:20:49.061 --> 00:20:53.440
1979 popular magazine Paris match published a sensational interview with Mr.

394
00:20:53.740 --> 00:20:56.680
Green recorded some time after his escape in the interview,

395
00:20:56.710 --> 00:21:00.310
Mr. Green acknowledged his respect for chief inspector Brie sought issuing the

396
00:21:00.311 --> 00:21:03.670
warning that he would not be caught alive the next time. Surprisingly,

397
00:21:03.671 --> 00:21:07.210
the gangster also admitted to further crimes giving very precise details.

398
00:21:07.240 --> 00:21:09.820
For example, on may the 26th, 1978, Mr. Green,

399
00:21:10.000 --> 00:21:13.510
as an accomplice had stolen 13 million francs from the casino Deauville in

400
00:21:13.511 --> 00:21:18.040
Normandy, as he put it attacking a casino is to attack the empire of vice.

401
00:21:18.100 --> 00:21:20.620
The only way to beat the house is to go with a gun.

402
00:21:20.890 --> 00:21:24.520
Mr. Green and friends had barely made it out alive after being chased and short

403
00:21:24.760 --> 00:21:29.200
answer by police on foot in car and from a helicopter after spending some days

404
00:21:29.201 --> 00:21:32.350
in the woods of Normandy mystery and baffled the police once again and prepared

405
00:21:32.530 --> 00:21:35.980
the next highest against a branch of banks, a C a T general,

406
00:21:36.130 --> 00:21:37.480
this was an ultra random choice.

407
00:21:37.480 --> 00:21:40.960
The general director of this bank had sued Mr. Green for slander following the

408
00:21:40.961 --> 00:21:43.270
publication of his book, instinct of death.

409
00:21:43.330 --> 00:21:46.240
When Mr. Green was forced to pay damages, he wrote to the director,

410
00:21:46.510 --> 00:21:49.000
you are taking all my money. That's okay,

411
00:21:49.300 --> 00:21:52.840
but consider this to be a loan on January the third, 1979.

412
00:21:52.841 --> 00:21:56.170
Another interview emerged this time published by liberation here.

413
00:21:56.171 --> 00:21:59.710
He gave details of his attempted kidnapping of Charlotte petty in November of

414
00:21:59.711 --> 00:22:00.544
1978.

415
00:22:00.700 --> 00:22:04.330
This is the judge who had sent him to the Sansei mystery rated the judges flats,

416
00:22:04.360 --> 00:22:07.990
but its patina was not there in raged mystery sprayed the judge's family with

417
00:22:07.991 --> 00:22:11.470
tear gas and left. The flat, the apartment block had been surrounded by police,

418
00:22:11.471 --> 00:22:15.010
but the gangster escaped by taking another officer hostage, Mr.

419
00:22:15.160 --> 00:22:16.780
Green's reputation with the press was not always.

420
00:22:16.781 --> 00:22:20.610
So Corteal in September of 1979, ex policeman and journalist Shak,

421
00:22:21.070 --> 00:22:24.610
Tilly accused mastering of being a dishonorable crook who betrayed as

422
00:22:24.611 --> 00:22:25.444
accomplices.

423
00:22:25.510 --> 00:22:29.590
Mr. Green was a little bit invited to the aid to a remote cave for an exclusive

424
00:22:29.591 --> 00:22:32.320
interview. And the journalist fell into the trap. Mr.

425
00:22:32.321 --> 00:22:35.530
N tortured him and shot him three times specifically.

426
00:22:35.531 --> 00:22:38.230
He shot him in the face to stop him talking crappy,

427
00:22:38.231 --> 00:22:40.480
shot him in the arm to stop him writing crap.

428
00:22:40.750 --> 00:22:43.270
And he shot him in the leg just for the pleasure of it.

429
00:22:43.630 --> 00:22:45.430
But fortunately he survived.

430
00:22:51.570 --> 00:22:51.660
<v 1>[Inaudible].</v>

431
00:22:51.660 --> 00:22:53.580
<v 0>All the criminal activity, the interviews,</v>

432
00:22:53.640 --> 00:22:57.000
the confirmations and the successful escapes were an embarrassment for the

433
00:22:57.001 --> 00:23:00.810
police and the government inspector Broussard alongside his new deputy Abella

434
00:23:00.811 --> 00:23:03.330
Strozzi. We're often close to finding Mr. Green,

435
00:23:03.331 --> 00:23:06.690
but they were always one step behind. Then at the end of October, 1979,

436
00:23:07.170 --> 00:23:10.410
Broussard and Bella Strozzi received a tip off Mr. Green was living with his new

437
00:23:10.980 --> 00:23:15.270
girlfriend's barmaids Sylvia and Shaq quo in the port to see you in a core area.

438
00:23:15.300 --> 00:23:18.990
The detectives assembled a team of 50 offices in 15 vehicles and prepared a plan

439
00:23:18.991 --> 00:23:20.370
of action. They would take Mr.

440
00:23:20.610 --> 00:23:24.690
Green by surprise inside his car by blocking him at the fronts and rare with two

441
00:23:24.691 --> 00:23:25.410
trucks.

442
00:23:25.410 --> 00:23:29.910
Prisaad Galt authorization from his supervising magistrate to act in a state of

443
00:23:29.911 --> 00:23:34.050
permanent self-defense this allowed maximum force reaction due to the danger

444
00:23:34.110 --> 00:23:37.380
posed by Mr. Green. And now it's November the second, 1979,

445
00:23:37.800 --> 00:23:41.460
the day of the debt at 3:15 PM. Mr. Green pulls out from his parking spot,

446
00:23:41.520 --> 00:23:43.350
but a truck with a blue top hole in blocks.

447
00:23:43.351 --> 00:23:47.300
The way then the top Olin flies open and three men armed with assault rifles,

448
00:23:47.301 --> 00:23:50.900
jump out Mr. Green, immediately docks probably reaching for the hand grenades,

449
00:23:50.930 --> 00:23:55.070
but the seatbelt blocks his movements instinctively all three men open fire

450
00:23:55.610 --> 00:23:57.380
piercing. The windshield with 21 rounds.

451
00:23:57.950 --> 00:24:01.610
Sylvia is severely injured and will lose an eye. Jack Mr. Green, public enemy.

452
00:24:01.611 --> 00:24:06.020
Number one dies on the spot as predicted. He wouldn't be caught alive again.

453
00:24:06.170 --> 00:24:09.590
The police operation and its aftermath remain controversial resolved,

454
00:24:09.591 --> 00:24:13.640
and his men were seen drinking champagne by the corpse and hours later even

455
00:24:13.641 --> 00:24:15.560
offered a glass to Mr. Green's daughter.

456
00:24:15.860 --> 00:24:19.730
The controversy fueled the rhetoric of those who saw the stream as this sort of

457
00:24:19.731 --> 00:24:22.340
folk hero, but should he really be remembered as such,

458
00:24:22.490 --> 00:24:24.350
I'll only quote his spiritual testaments,

459
00:24:24.351 --> 00:24:27.320
which he recorded for Sylvia to listen to after his death?

460
00:24:27.440 --> 00:24:31.370
What is terrible is that some will try to make a hero out of me, but after all,

461
00:24:31.430 --> 00:24:34.910
there are no heroes in crime. There are only men who are marginalized,

462
00:24:35.030 --> 00:24:39.650
who do not accept laws because laws are made by the rich and the

463
00:24:39.651 --> 00:24:42.710
powerful. So I really hope you found that video. Interesting. If you did,
