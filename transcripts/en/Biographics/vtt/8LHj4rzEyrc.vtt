00:00:00.300 --> 00:00:03.960
<v 0>Oh, everybody. This episode of the show is brought to you by magic spoon.</v>

2
00:00:04.230 --> 00:00:06.630
If you're a regular viewer of my child, I'm going to put that down.

3
00:00:06.810 --> 00:00:09.540
You'll know that I'm a big fan of cereal because well,

4
00:00:09.570 --> 00:00:13.230
who isn't cereal is awesome, but it's not always good for you.

5
00:00:13.410 --> 00:00:16.650
There were several years where I just didn't eat cereal because you know,

6
00:00:16.651 --> 00:00:20.670
usually it's got just more sugar than you need in your life.

7
00:00:20.700 --> 00:00:22.530
I don't really have the healthiest diet in the world,

8
00:00:22.531 --> 00:00:24.420
but generally I tend to stay in okay.

9
00:00:24.421 --> 00:00:28.590
Shape by not eating tons of unnecessary sugar, as you'd normally find in cereal.

10
00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:30.840
Anyway, along comes a company called magic spoon, and they're like,

11
00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:35.430
somebody's got to try this. There's no sugar. There's hardly any carbs.

12
00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:39.210
And there's 11 grams of protein. And I'm like, I had coms were bad.

13
00:00:39.280 --> 00:00:41.790
I didn't really know much about them. Honestly. I know protein is good,

14
00:00:41.970 --> 00:00:46.470
but this one, no sugar, but it tastes amazing. It's also keto friendly,

15
00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:50.340
gluten free, low carb. GMO-free all of that good stuff as well.

16
00:00:50.341 --> 00:00:51.840
And originally they had four flavors.

17
00:00:51.841 --> 00:00:53.850
I was actually eating the cocoa ones today,

18
00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:57.390
which is one of the original four flavors just because that's what I felt like.

19
00:00:57.600 --> 00:01:00.150
But recently they sent me these two answers.

20
00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:01.860
Can you guys still hear me cinnamon,

21
00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:05.730
which I saw cannot be beat that wasn't until they introduced peanut butter

22
00:01:05.731 --> 00:01:07.800
flavor and all the Americans. When I did a,

23
00:01:07.801 --> 00:01:10.470
an add on another channel like seven, have you never had peanut butter cereal?

24
00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:11.790
I'm like, it just, wasn't a thing.

25
00:01:11.791 --> 00:01:15.630
When I was growing up in the UK and now I've had it.

26
00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:19.500
I'm never going back. Zero sugar, three grams of net carbs,

27
00:01:19.501 --> 00:01:22.440
seven grams of protein. This is magic spoon. It is wonderful.

34
00:01:44.810 --> 00:01:47.420
If you've watched our video on the summit of man and enjoyed it,

35
00:01:47.421 --> 00:01:48.530
then you're in luck.

36
00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:52.100
As we are about to explore a similarly puzzling case involving an unidentified

37
00:01:52.101 --> 00:01:55.850
body and an investigation with plenty of unexpected twists and turns.

38
00:01:55.910 --> 00:01:58.550
That sounds like that pulls right out of an inflaming novel.

39
00:01:58.580 --> 00:02:01.850
This one is 50 years old and comes to us from Norway.

40
00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:05.900
When hikers found the burned body of a woman in the foothills outside Bergen,

41
00:02:05.901 --> 00:02:09.740
they did not know they were about to trigger one of the greatest mysteries in

42
00:02:09.741 --> 00:02:12.860
the country's history. It is known as the is doll women,

43
00:02:12.950 --> 00:02:16.880
and it is proven to be remarkably enduring with many crime buffs,

44
00:02:16.910 --> 00:02:20.360
not just due to the fact that the victim remains unidentified,

45
00:02:20.570 --> 00:02:23.960
but because of all the circumstantial evidence that strongly suggests the

46
00:02:23.961 --> 00:02:28.490
possibility that she may have been a spy disguises, fake identities,

47
00:02:28.640 --> 00:02:33.200
counterfeit passports, secretive behavior, and to gory unsolved deaths.

48
00:02:33.290 --> 00:02:36.740
This case had them all. So sit back, relax.

49
00:02:36.920 --> 00:02:41.510
As we take a look at the most mystifying cold case from the cold war,

50
00:02:41.930 --> 00:02:42.763
the iStar.

51
00:02:49.040 --> 00:02:49.400
<v 1>[Inaudible].</v>

52
00:02:49.400 --> 00:02:49.971
<v 0>It's stolen,</v>

53
00:02:49.971 --> 00:02:54.770
literally ice Valley is a basin at the foothills of Mount Aurukun and Norway

54
00:02:54.771 --> 00:02:55.850
near the city of Bergen.

55
00:02:55.880 --> 00:02:59.060
That is also called death Valley by the locals because it used to be a common

56
00:02:59.620 --> 00:03:00.850
spot hundreds of years ago.

57
00:03:01.030 --> 00:03:04.600
And it was also the place where some trackers fell to that deaths during heavy

58
00:03:04.601 --> 00:03:07.690
fog in the 1960s, despite its macabre reputation,

59
00:03:07.691 --> 00:03:10.960
it says remains a popular hiking spot. Back on November, the 29th,

60
00:03:10.961 --> 00:03:15.400
1970 a father and his two daughters decided to spend the morning crossing their

61
00:03:15.401 --> 00:03:16.120
Starlin.

62
00:03:16.120 --> 00:03:19.390
They were hoping it would be a fun outdoor activity and a good bit of exercise,

63
00:03:19.630 --> 00:03:23.530
but the experience turned into something far more sinister as they were hiking

64
00:03:23.531 --> 00:03:26.650
across the foothills. The trio noticed a strange burning smell.

65
00:03:26.680 --> 00:03:28.750
It looked around them and saw a grim sight.

66
00:03:28.840 --> 00:03:30.730
It was a corpse that had been set on fire.

67
00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:34.660
It was the body of a woman spread across some rocks and with its arms extended

68
00:03:34.661 --> 00:03:37.870
forward, like a boxer, a common occurrence in burn victims.

69
00:03:37.900 --> 00:03:39.310
Once the family got over the shock,

70
00:03:39.340 --> 00:03:42.310
they alerted the police who arrived quickly on the scene and opens an

71
00:03:42.311 --> 00:03:43.144
investigation.

72
00:03:43.180 --> 00:03:46.300
First thing they noticed was that the women did not appear to be a regular

73
00:03:46.301 --> 00:03:46.720
hiker.

74
00:03:46.720 --> 00:03:50.200
The starters she was found off the beaten path in and out of the way place.

75
00:03:50.320 --> 00:03:53.770
There was not used for walking. The body was burned beyond recognition,

76
00:03:53.980 --> 00:03:57.400
but only on the front, her head hair and face were all heavily charged,

77
00:03:57.401 --> 00:03:59.290
but her back was mainly untouched.

78
00:03:59.320 --> 00:04:02.170
Police initially thought that women might've thrown herself backward after

79
00:04:02.290 --> 00:04:03.580
somehow catching fire,

80
00:04:03.610 --> 00:04:07.630
which would explain why only her front was burned and how she ended up in a

81
00:04:07.631 --> 00:04:11.410
remote area. However, they could not find any trace of a campfire.

82
00:04:11.440 --> 00:04:15.070
So she was either burned in a different way or another person cleaned up the

83
00:04:15.071 --> 00:04:17.410
scene afterwards, despite the lack of a campfire,

84
00:04:17.650 --> 00:04:20.020
there were certainly plenty of other items at the scene,

85
00:04:20.021 --> 00:04:23.260
but they too made investigators raise their eyebrows.

86
00:04:23.290 --> 00:04:27.190
None of them pointed at a possible ID. There were personal effects, jewelry,

87
00:04:27.220 --> 00:04:29.140
a watch, some bottles, a broken umbrella,

88
00:04:29.380 --> 00:04:32.920
but they were all positioned in a weird way beside the body and what the

89
00:04:32.921 --> 00:04:36.070
forensic investigators described as some kind of ceremony.

90
00:04:36.220 --> 00:04:39.580
There were also lots of items of clothing. Most of them partially burned,

91
00:04:39.610 --> 00:04:42.730
but the strange thing was that they all had their tags cut off.

92
00:04:42.970 --> 00:04:46.150
So they couldn't be identified. Even the bottles had their labels removed.

93
00:04:46.180 --> 00:04:49.150
The body was too damaged to get a good impression of what the women used to look

94
00:04:49.151 --> 00:04:49.841
like. However,

95
00:04:49.841 --> 00:04:53.260
by jumping ahead just a bit so we can provide the description that they obtained

96
00:04:53.261 --> 00:04:56.860
at a later date and then sent into a, for some international assistance.

97
00:04:56.890 --> 00:05:00.280
They described the woman as being between 25 and 40 years old,

98
00:05:00.460 --> 00:05:05.440
164 centimeters in height weighing 56 kilograms with symbols and Brown

99
00:05:05.441 --> 00:05:09.580
eyes. She had broad hips, small face, small ears and long brownish blank.

100
00:05:10.060 --> 00:05:14.320
One in a ponytail tied with the blue and white prints ribbon from the remains of

101
00:05:14.321 --> 00:05:14.891
our clothes.

102
00:05:14.891 --> 00:05:18.970
It is believed she was wearing a dark blue bubble nylon jacket and matching

103
00:05:19.300 --> 00:05:22.330
belts. Closing in the fronts with two into lockable rings,

104
00:05:22.480 --> 00:05:24.400
they green and blue check William shawl,

105
00:05:24.550 --> 00:05:28.300
the dark blue machine that sweater dark blue slacks with a front zip black

106
00:05:28.301 --> 00:05:31.960
Jersey, long underwear, dark blue panties, blue pattern, sports stockings,

107
00:05:31.990 --> 00:05:35.710
semi long blue rubber boots with white soles and drunk leasing Brown,

108
00:05:35.770 --> 00:05:36.610
fake fat Cape.

109
00:05:36.670 --> 00:05:40.240
Her jewelry included steel sports wristwatch with solo trademark rounds,

110
00:05:40.241 --> 00:05:43.540
gold filigree earrings, and a gold ring set with a large cameo,

111
00:05:43.720 --> 00:05:45.460
as you might have already guessed by now,

112
00:05:45.490 --> 00:05:49.090
none of this proved useful as the victim still remains on identifying to this

113
00:05:49.091 --> 00:05:52.300
day with no other name. She became known as the installer.

114
00:05:57.930 --> 00:05:58.763
<v 1>[Inaudible].</v>

115
00:05:59.900 --> 00:06:02.980
<v 0>The local police from Bergen could tell that this would not be a normal</v>

116
00:06:02.981 --> 00:06:06.880
investigation. So they asked for help from the country's elite police service,

117
00:06:07.060 --> 00:06:10.240
the national criminal investigation surface or Crip us.

118
00:06:10.300 --> 00:06:11.560
The team found its first big league.

119
00:06:11.590 --> 00:06:15.700
Just a few days after the body had been located that are local tourist spots in

120
00:06:16.030 --> 00:06:17.830
bargain to keep an eye out for unclaimed luggage.

121
00:06:17.860 --> 00:06:21.310
They then found two large suitcases that had been left at the luggage office.

122
00:06:21.311 --> 00:06:24.940
If the railway station in Bergen, one of them contains a pair of sunglasses,

123
00:06:24.941 --> 00:06:26.410
which had a fingerprint on the lens,

124
00:06:26.411 --> 00:06:28.540
which was then matched the body in the ice Valley.

125
00:06:28.690 --> 00:06:32.080
There could be no doubt that the police had located the luggage of the adult

126
00:06:32.380 --> 00:06:36.070
women among other things. The suitcases contained clothes, cosmetics teaspoons,

127
00:06:36.071 --> 00:06:39.670
a comb and a hairbrush to have eczema cream and five different types of

128
00:06:39.671 --> 00:06:40.360
currency,

129
00:06:40.360 --> 00:06:44.800
but mostly German Marx and Norwegian kroner also inside were multiple wigs and

130
00:06:44.801 --> 00:06:48.940
prescription eyewear that had only regular glass and no corrective lenses.

131
00:06:48.970 --> 00:06:52.210
Both of these would have proven useful to someone looking to disguise

132
00:06:52.211 --> 00:06:53.500
themselves. At this point,

133
00:06:53.530 --> 00:06:57.550
investigators were certain that an identification was only going to be a matter

134
00:06:57.551 --> 00:07:01.270
of time, but as they carefully went through the contents of the suitcases,

135
00:07:01.300 --> 00:07:04.600
examining them all piece by piece, that confidence was plummeting.

136
00:07:04.720 --> 00:07:08.350
It seemed that the same care had been shown to these items as had been to the

137
00:07:08.351 --> 00:07:10.840
ones found alongside the install women. Again,

138
00:07:10.990 --> 00:07:14.260
all identifiers have been removed, clothing tags, cosmetic labels,

139
00:07:14.410 --> 00:07:16.720
even the prescription sticker on the eczema cream.

140
00:07:16.840 --> 00:07:20.950
Somebody wants to make sense and that nobody would find out the identity of the

141
00:07:21.100 --> 00:07:21.933
bunny.

142
00:07:27.880 --> 00:07:31.120
Even though the suitcases did not help the police identify the install women,

143
00:07:31.270 --> 00:07:33.370
they did provide them with two clues,

144
00:07:33.460 --> 00:07:37.900
a shopping bag and a writing pad with some notes on it. First, the shopping bag,

145
00:07:37.930 --> 00:07:40.510
it was labeled Oscar wrote about his footwear store,

146
00:07:40.540 --> 00:07:42.640
which was located in the city of Stavanger.

147
00:07:42.670 --> 00:07:46.810
It was strange that somebody who had been so meticulous about removing all other

148
00:07:46.811 --> 00:07:48.940
brand names would leave this behind,

149
00:07:48.970 --> 00:07:52.330
but the police were just happy to have a solid lead. They traveled,

150
00:07:52.331 --> 00:07:56.140
just have anger and talk to the owner's son who remembered the victim is a very

151
00:07:56.380 --> 00:08:00.730
well dressed, nice looking woman with dark hair and a calm and quiet expression.

152
00:08:01.300 --> 00:08:04.420
Firstie confirmed what everybody already expected. She was a foreigner.

153
00:08:04.660 --> 00:08:06.280
The woman spoke English, but with an accent.

154
00:08:06.370 --> 00:08:08.650
And since he thought that she had an unusual sense,

155
00:08:08.651 --> 00:08:11.740
which he later concluded was garlic. The owner's son gave the police.

156
00:08:11.741 --> 00:08:15.280
The first detailed description of the women found in the DePaul bulletin that we

157
00:08:15.281 --> 00:08:16.300
mentioned previously.

158
00:08:16.330 --> 00:08:19.870
He said that she had come in three weeks out looking to buy a pair of boots.

159
00:08:19.900 --> 00:08:23.860
She took her time examining the designs close up before settling on the pair of

160
00:08:23.861 --> 00:08:27.610
blue boons from these celebrity line of ask him gummy VEGF fabric.

161
00:08:27.730 --> 00:08:28.990
They weren't wrapped. In fact,

162
00:08:28.991 --> 00:08:32.170
they were one of the most popular models in the entire country, but crucially,

163
00:08:32.440 --> 00:08:34.510
they matched the burn boots found on the body,

164
00:08:34.630 --> 00:08:38.200
providing police with confirmation that they were talking about the same person.

165
00:08:38.230 --> 00:08:39.460
Then there was the other clue.

166
00:08:39.790 --> 00:08:42.070
The notepad only the first page had writing on it,

167
00:08:42.071 --> 00:08:44.590
which consisted of multiple series of letters and numbers.

168
00:08:44.770 --> 00:08:47.600
It looked like a code and the police managed to crack a part of it.

169
00:08:47.680 --> 00:08:51.730
It's after a few days of work, it wasn't anything shady, but it was strange.

170
00:08:51.760 --> 00:08:53.620
The code seemed to be a travel record.

171
00:08:53.650 --> 00:08:56.730
Presumably noting all the places where the installment had traveled,

172
00:08:56.760 --> 00:08:59.760
where it said, Oh, two, two Oh two eight P for example,

173
00:08:59.790 --> 00:09:03.990
denoted a stay in Paris between October the 22nd and the 28th.

174
00:09:03.991 --> 00:09:08.610
It was followed by Oh two nine PS, which meant that on October the 29th,

175
00:09:08.820 --> 00:09:13.620
she left Paris Vista Banga afterwards came Oh three, zero B and five,

176
00:09:13.621 --> 00:09:17.370
which matched up to her stay in Bergen between October the 30th of November,

177
00:09:17.371 --> 00:09:20.220
the fifth. These were eventually corroborated by other bits of evidence.

178
00:09:20.221 --> 00:09:24.270
But most of the note remains undecided mainly because each city was only marked

179
00:09:24.271 --> 00:09:25.104
with a single letter.

180
00:09:25.260 --> 00:09:28.740
And it would be impossible to know for certain which cities these refer to,

181
00:09:28.860 --> 00:09:32.790
but even so it showed Norwegian police that the victim was a well-traveled woman

182
00:09:33.090 --> 00:09:35.730
who moved quickly from city to city. Up until this point,

183
00:09:36.210 --> 00:09:40.560
the only concern seemed to be finding out the identity of the install women and

184
00:09:40.561 --> 00:09:41.580
to watch what happens out.

185
00:09:41.640 --> 00:09:44.910
But increasingly that was starting to wonder what business brought out to

186
00:09:44.911 --> 00:09:45.510
Bergen.

187
00:09:45.510 --> 00:09:49.680
Especially as rumors started flying around that she may not have just been an

188
00:09:49.681 --> 00:09:50.580
innocent bystander.

189
00:09:55.430 --> 00:09:56.263
<v 1>[Inaudible].</v>

190
00:09:57.560 --> 00:10:00.500
<v 0>The install woman was a spy was not very far fetched.</v>

191
00:10:00.650 --> 00:10:01.730
There was the middle of the cold war.

192
00:10:01.731 --> 00:10:05.630
After all an espionage was a constant threat or this whole thing took place less

193
00:10:05.631 --> 00:10:07.670
than three years before the Lillehammer affair.

194
00:10:07.671 --> 00:10:10.370
When Israeli agents from the Maasai traveled to Norway,

195
00:10:10.371 --> 00:10:14.270
to assassinate and innocent Moroccan waiter and mistaking him for one of the

196
00:10:14.271 --> 00:10:19.010
leaders of the black September militant groups that was responsible for the 1972

197
00:10:19.011 --> 00:10:20.840
summer Olympics massacre in Munich,

198
00:10:21.050 --> 00:10:24.140
even though they would not admit it until decades later, noise,

199
00:10:24.141 --> 00:10:25.520
military intelligence branch,

200
00:10:25.521 --> 00:10:29.930
the Norwegian intelligence service or NIS had launched their own investigation

201
00:10:29.931 --> 00:10:31.160
into the install women.

202
00:10:31.161 --> 00:10:34.940
But they were more concerned with finding out the reason why she visited Bergen

203
00:10:35.030 --> 00:10:38.270
after a while. It wasn't exactly a hotspot for international tourists back then,

204
00:10:38.271 --> 00:10:42.380
but that was some military tests with new rockets being performed in the area.

205
00:10:42.650 --> 00:10:45.890
Their reports turned out to be inconclusive back with the regular police.

206
00:10:45.891 --> 00:10:48.740
They were still trying to figure out who the iStar women was.

207
00:10:48.770 --> 00:10:51.830
They had a good description of her, thanks to the salesman at the shoe store.

208
00:10:51.940 --> 00:10:55.280
And it's the fact that she was arrest site and Stavanger and bug and any made

209
00:10:55.281 --> 00:10:57.950
him more memorable. Sure enough. After visiting a few hotels,

210
00:10:57.951 --> 00:11:00.350
they discovered the one she'd been staying at in Stavanger.

211
00:11:00.380 --> 00:11:03.320
It was the hotel since firsthand located close to the shoe store.

212
00:11:03.500 --> 00:11:06.170
The receptionist that remembered a woman who matched the description.

213
00:11:06.171 --> 00:11:09.530
And I remember of the cleaning staff also recalled seeing how wearing the blue

214
00:11:09.531 --> 00:11:13.370
boots that she had purchased from the store. This had to be the same person.

215
00:11:13.430 --> 00:11:16.760
And she had checked in under the name for Nyla log from Belgium.

216
00:11:16.970 --> 00:11:21.290
So did the Norwegian police just identify the iSTYLE woman was the end of the

217
00:11:21.291 --> 00:11:24.770
case in sight? Well, of course we know that was not what happened,

218
00:11:24.830 --> 00:11:28.280
but in the moment they thought their prospects were looking pretty good. First,

219
00:11:28.281 --> 00:11:31.160
they reached out to Interpol and Belgium police to help tracking down their

220
00:11:31.161 --> 00:11:31.670
victim.

221
00:11:31.670 --> 00:11:35.600
Then they tried to retrace our steps between Stavanger and Bergen and find out

222
00:11:35.601 --> 00:11:37.610
which hotel she was staying at in the last city.

223
00:11:37.730 --> 00:11:40.220
This is where the case gets even more complicated.

224
00:11:40.430 --> 00:11:44.720
There was nobody called Fenella law who had checked in at any hotel in Bergen.

225
00:11:44.780 --> 00:11:48.320
She had used a fake name and somewhere between Stavanger and Bergen,

226
00:11:48.321 --> 00:11:49.850
she had changed our identity.

227
00:11:49.940 --> 00:11:52.520
This also meant the police were back to square one,

228
00:11:59.180 --> 00:12:02.460
Maybe not quite square. One investigators might not have had a name,

229
00:12:02.461 --> 00:12:05.910
but at least they had a handwriting back then all foreigners who visited Norway

230
00:12:06.030 --> 00:12:09.210
have to fill in an alien registration form to check into a hotel.

231
00:12:09.270 --> 00:12:12.360
It contains the person's name, address, passport number and signature,

232
00:12:12.361 --> 00:12:15.990
which also implies that the install women had a fake passport under the name

233
00:12:16.140 --> 00:12:17.040
Fenella law.

234
00:12:17.130 --> 00:12:20.460
Otherwise she would not have been able to check into the hotel since Fitton

235
00:12:20.640 --> 00:12:22.950
sends police and the forms she filled out in Stavanger,

236
00:12:22.980 --> 00:12:26.790
they brought in handwriting experts to compare writing samples collected from

237
00:12:26.970 --> 00:12:31.140
other registration forms from hotels, all over the country, not just Bergen,

238
00:12:31.290 --> 00:12:34.890
even in such a strange case, what they discovered still proved to be a surprise,

239
00:12:35.070 --> 00:12:37.710
as it turns out the women had stayed in multiple hotels in Norway,

240
00:12:37.920 --> 00:12:39.330
under numerous assumed identities,

241
00:12:39.480 --> 00:12:43.290
which must've meant that she had access to a lot of fake passports.

242
00:12:43.500 --> 00:12:47.400
She also pretended to be Claudia tilt from Brussels Genevieve last year from

243
00:12:47.880 --> 00:12:49.410
live in Vera jar from Antwerp.

244
00:12:49.411 --> 00:12:53.370
And there's a business need and HAFA from Austin's Gloria Nielsen from Ganz and

245
00:12:53.610 --> 00:12:57.330
Alexia, Zara Marquez from the Biana under these names.

246
00:12:57.390 --> 00:12:59.940
She had checked into hotels, not just in Bergen and starving it,

247
00:12:59.941 --> 00:13:02.760
but also Oslo and Trondheim before her death. For example,

248
00:13:02.761 --> 00:13:07.200
she first stayed at hotel Rosencranz for two days before moving to a hotel Horta

249
00:13:07.590 --> 00:13:08.850
Hyman for another five days,

250
00:13:08.851 --> 00:13:12.330
both located in Bergen and to the is at least one more fake name, there,

251
00:13:12.331 --> 00:13:14.340
a sugar snack, which she had used in Paris,

252
00:13:14.341 --> 00:13:16.830
but who knows how many identities she really had?

253
00:13:16.980 --> 00:13:20.280
You might've noticed that most of the names came from cities in Belgium,

254
00:13:20.370 --> 00:13:23.910
Norwegian police thought this might be because she was an actual citizen of that

255
00:13:23.911 --> 00:13:27.510
country. This Belgian authorities investigated the case on their end.

256
00:13:27.510 --> 00:13:31.710
It could find no solid leads. Unsurprisingly, all of the names used were fake.

257
00:13:31.770 --> 00:13:35.160
The whole spy idea was becoming more and more plausible at the very least.

258
00:13:35.161 --> 00:13:38.490
She definitely was not just a tourist who was in the wrong place at the wrong

259
00:13:38.491 --> 00:13:42.510
time. That had to be some kind of clear ulterior purpose to our actions.

260
00:13:42.511 --> 00:13:46.140
But Norwegian authorities were still struggling to discover what that could have

261
00:13:46.141 --> 00:13:49.590
been after talking with the hotel staff who remembered to our police found out

262
00:13:49.620 --> 00:13:51.720
that the iStar woman also spoke German.

263
00:13:51.721 --> 00:13:55.470
And on one occasion she had dinner in the dining hall next to a German Navy

264
00:13:55.471 --> 00:13:58.440
officer. Although the two did not appear to interact together,

265
00:13:58.500 --> 00:14:01.890
none of the peculiar detail was that the woman often requested a change of rooms

266
00:14:01.891 --> 00:14:04.500
at these hotels that she was staying at. And in one case,

267
00:14:04.501 --> 00:14:05.770
she asked to change rooms three,

268
00:14:12.660 --> 00:14:14.670
While the police were busy, chasing down leads,

269
00:14:14.671 --> 00:14:18.270
the forensic pathologists were working to see what data they could obtain from

270
00:14:18.271 --> 00:14:19.830
the body itself. Unfortunately,

271
00:14:19.831 --> 00:14:23.340
the autopsy did not exactly prove to be a treasure trove of new information.

272
00:14:23.790 --> 00:14:24.180
Arivale did the,

273
00:14:24.180 --> 00:14:27.810
as Darwin had never given birth or been pregnant is uncovered a bruise on the

274
00:14:27.811 --> 00:14:29.970
side of her neck, which could have come from an altercation,

275
00:14:29.971 --> 00:14:31.830
but it could have also resulted from a fall.

276
00:14:31.860 --> 00:14:35.070
The woman had been in good health antibodies showed no signs of any serious

277
00:14:35.071 --> 00:14:36.510
illnesses that being said.

278
00:14:36.540 --> 00:14:39.780
She had suffered an excruciating death traces of Petro with founds,

279
00:14:39.781 --> 00:14:43.050
which was used to set her on fire and the presence of certain other smoke

280
00:14:43.051 --> 00:14:45.810
particles in our lungs indicated that she was alive while burning.

281
00:14:46.080 --> 00:14:48.750
She had lethal concentrations of carbon monoxide in her blood.

282
00:14:48.810 --> 00:14:52.580
She had also swallowed huge amounts of sleeping Bill's phenoma prior to our

283
00:14:52.581 --> 00:14:54.560
death between 50 and 70,

284
00:14:54.710 --> 00:14:57.890
but they did not yet have time to fully dissolve and get absorbed into our

285
00:14:57.891 --> 00:14:59.660
bloodstream. According to the autopsy,

286
00:14:59.661 --> 00:15:03.140
the headstone woman died from carbon monoxide poisoning combined with ingesting

287
00:15:03.141 --> 00:15:06.470
a huge quantity of sleeping pills because of this Norwegian police labeled her

288
00:15:06.500 --> 00:15:09.170
official cause of death as probable suicide.

289
00:15:09.350 --> 00:15:11.390
Although many are skeptical of this conclusion.

290
00:15:11.480 --> 00:15:14.480
One investigator said in a recent interview that very few of them actually

291
00:15:14.870 --> 00:15:18.200
believe the death was suicide due to the remoteness of the location where the

292
00:15:18.201 --> 00:15:22.070
body was found, but even more so due to the extreme method employed,

293
00:15:22.130 --> 00:15:25.010
very few people set themselves on fire as a means of suicide.

294
00:15:25.220 --> 00:15:26.060
And on the other hand,

295
00:15:26.080 --> 00:15:29.150
if she only intended to take the sleeping pills and Sater self ablaze by

296
00:15:29.151 --> 00:15:31.490
accident, and what happened to the campfire,

297
00:15:31.610 --> 00:15:35.030
there was still more questions left unanswered than there were at the beginning

298
00:15:35.031 --> 00:15:36.590
of the investigation. However,

299
00:15:36.591 --> 00:15:39.470
with no more leads to pursue and an official cause of death,

300
00:15:39.620 --> 00:15:41.720
the case was closed in February, 1971.

301
00:15:41.780 --> 00:15:44.930
This tall woman is given a Catholic funeral attended by the officers who

302
00:15:44.931 --> 00:15:48.260
investigated her death. And she was buried in an unmarked grave.

303
00:15:48.590 --> 00:15:52.190
There was one part of her that was not buried with the rest, her teeth.

304
00:15:52.490 --> 00:15:54.560
There's still a woman has a lot of work done on her teeth.

305
00:15:54.561 --> 00:15:58.220
So investigators kept her jaw in the hopes that it might be useful in an

306
00:15:58.221 --> 00:16:02.270
identification. She had 14 fillings and unusually high number for a woman.

307
00:16:02.271 --> 00:16:05.000
Her age. Most of them had pre-made gold crowns,

308
00:16:05.001 --> 00:16:07.940
which are unlike those used in Scandinavia. At the time, again,

309
00:16:08.150 --> 00:16:11.540
this clue helped prove that the iStore woman was not a local that's.

310
00:16:11.600 --> 00:16:14.510
That was something that everybody already knew by that point.

311
00:16:14.600 --> 00:16:17.600
Those types of crowns were more common in Southern and central Europe,

312
00:16:17.630 --> 00:16:20.450
but they failed to provide a more specific localization.

313
00:16:20.600 --> 00:16:24.080
Ultimately it was another dead end, the case laid dormant for decades.

314
00:16:24.081 --> 00:16:26.900
And it wasn't until a few years ago that new progress was made,

315
00:16:27.050 --> 00:16:30.800
which might eventually help us solve the mystery of the install women.

316
00:16:36.790 --> 00:16:37.060
<v 1>[Inaudible].</v>

317
00:16:37.060 --> 00:16:39.130
<v 0>Like with many other decades, old cold cases.</v>

318
00:16:39.131 --> 00:16:42.310
There is always a hope that modern technology and new investigative methods

319
00:16:42.460 --> 00:16:45.460
might be able to yield additional information in ways that would have simply

320
00:16:45.461 --> 00:16:49.030
been impossible to achieve back when the crimes were originally committed.

321
00:16:49.150 --> 00:16:50.290
However, in this instance,

322
00:16:50.291 --> 00:16:54.670
the nucleus also benefited from a bit of serendipity after the case was closed

323
00:16:54.671 --> 00:16:55.510
in 1971,

324
00:16:55.511 --> 00:16:59.980
a professor of dentistry named Jazelle bang kept the DOL women's jaw in the

325
00:16:59.981 --> 00:17:02.920
hopes that somebody else might one day recognize their handiwork.

326
00:17:02.950 --> 00:17:04.600
He sent images to countless colleagues,

327
00:17:04.750 --> 00:17:06.550
had them published in dentistry journals,

328
00:17:06.551 --> 00:17:09.280
but it all proved fruitless as nobody came forward.

329
00:17:09.340 --> 00:17:12.670
Eventually the professor died and everybody assumes that the drawer had been

330
00:17:12.671 --> 00:17:14.410
discarded according to his success.

331
00:17:14.411 --> 00:17:17.380
And the records mentioned that the bone had been thrown away because it had

332
00:17:17.381 --> 00:17:22.300
started to smell. We fast forward now to 2017, when journalists from NRK noise,

333
00:17:22.301 --> 00:17:23.620
public broadcasting company,

334
00:17:23.920 --> 00:17:26.290
we're working on a new investigation into the install women,

335
00:17:26.440 --> 00:17:29.800
a bit of research on their part revealed that the jaw had not been destroyed,

336
00:17:29.801 --> 00:17:33.940
but rather preserved in the archives of Hawkins university hospital.

337
00:17:34.000 --> 00:17:37.630
This were going to investigators with the opportunity to re-examine the evidence

338
00:17:37.631 --> 00:17:39.610
with new technology. And soon enough,

339
00:17:39.730 --> 00:17:43.450
they hailed a major breakthrough researchers at the university of Bergen did an

340
00:17:43.451 --> 00:17:47.050
isotope analysis on the teeth in order to establish what they called a chemical

341
00:17:47.051 --> 00:17:47.680
signature.

342
00:17:47.680 --> 00:17:51.600
This was originally created when the teeth were first formed and it was altered

343
00:17:51.601 --> 00:17:56.400
along the way by which compounds were absorbed at specific stages of teeth

344
00:17:57.090 --> 00:17:57.180
developments.

345
00:17:57.180 --> 00:18:00.420
It was the first time that this technique was employed by Norwegian police,

346
00:18:00.421 --> 00:18:01.440
but it paid dividends.

347
00:18:01.540 --> 00:18:04.470
Is it narrowed down the place of origin for the unidentified woman.

348
00:18:04.500 --> 00:18:07.920
Tentatively scientists believed that she might've been born in the area around

349
00:18:07.921 --> 00:18:09.720
the city of Nuremberg in Germany,

350
00:18:09.721 --> 00:18:12.810
and then relocated further West before her teenage years,

351
00:18:12.930 --> 00:18:17.010
somewhere in the border area between Germany, France, Belgium, and Luxembourg,

352
00:18:17.130 --> 00:18:20.280
her age was also revised. Thanks to the bone analysis previously,

353
00:18:20.281 --> 00:18:22.170
there was only a vague approximation to go on,

354
00:18:22.171 --> 00:18:25.680
which said that the iStar women was between 25 and 40 years old at the time of

355
00:18:25.681 --> 00:18:29.250
our death. This new estimate placed to age at the higher end of that scale,

356
00:18:29.280 --> 00:18:32.850
saying that she was around 40 years old when she died, give or take four years,

357
00:18:32.910 --> 00:18:35.820
there is also another tool to consider genetic genealogy.

358
00:18:35.880 --> 00:18:39.720
This is the current darling of the forensic world after helping put to bed

359
00:18:39.750 --> 00:18:42.270
multiple high profile cold cases in recent years,

360
00:18:42.570 --> 00:18:44.850
it's naturally that of the infamous golden state killer.

361
00:18:44.880 --> 00:18:47.880
There is hope that it might be able to do the same with iStar women.

362
00:18:47.910 --> 00:18:51.840
Scientists have been able to create a DNA profile while isotope analysis.

363
00:18:51.841 --> 00:18:55.320
If a tooth enamel revealed that she was born sometime around 1930,

364
00:18:55.500 --> 00:18:59.850
probably near or in Nuremberg. And later she moved closer to the Western border.

365
00:18:59.970 --> 00:19:01.710
It's not exactly a slam dunk,

366
00:19:01.770 --> 00:19:04.530
but it is the first solid lead in almost five decades.

367
00:19:04.740 --> 00:19:08.220
And a good enough reason to believe that this is one mystery that might be

368
00:19:08.221 --> 00:19:11.640
solved in the years to come. So I really hope you found that video. Interesting.
