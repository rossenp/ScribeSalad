If you click the link in the description below,

00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:16.530
that's what the first thousand people only more on them. And just a bit

6
00:00:22.610 --> 00:00:25.550
When one thinks of the first world war two, that just comes to mind.

7
00:00:25.580 --> 00:00:28.790
The war on the grounds was a bloody stalemate with modern weapons,

8
00:00:28.820 --> 00:00:33.110
but our data tactics that led to millions of soldiers being slaughtered by

9
00:00:33.111 --> 00:00:36.080
contrast the war in the air is still heavily romanticized.

10
00:00:36.081 --> 00:00:37.280
Over a hundred years later,

11
00:00:37.430 --> 00:00:40.670
barely a decade after the Wright brothers first demonstrated a functional

12
00:00:40.671 --> 00:00:41.330
airplane.

13
00:00:41.330 --> 00:00:44.870
The combatants of the first world war had developed a number of aircraft for

14
00:00:44.871 --> 00:00:48.050
military purposes, most famous of all of course, but the fighter planes,

15
00:00:48.110 --> 00:00:52.460
the rumbling loud devices built out of woods with canvas wings and an open

16
00:00:52.461 --> 00:00:56.510
cockpit may seem ridiculous by modern standards, but during the war,

17
00:00:56.790 --> 00:00:58.580
they were at the cutting edge of technology.

18
00:00:58.610 --> 00:01:02.720
Fighter pilots were celebrated heroes, the lost nights of Europe,

19
00:01:02.750 --> 00:01:06.170
who jousted at each other with machine guns in the name of Ana,

20
00:01:06.350 --> 00:01:09.290
no one typified this image better than Manfred Von Richt.

21
00:01:09.650 --> 00:01:13.280
Often with 80 confirmed area victories retro often was the leading ACE of the

22
00:01:13.281 --> 00:01:16.940
first world war. More than that, it was a national celebrity in Germany.

23
00:01:17.030 --> 00:01:20.780
The public followed his exploits in newspapers and infantry soldiers carried

24
00:01:20.781 --> 00:01:22.070
pictures of him in their pockets.

25
00:01:22.540 --> 00:01:24.560
Rickshaw often followed his own code of chivalry.

26
00:01:24.561 --> 00:01:28.520
That ends in the respect of both his fellow pilots and his enemies who

27
00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:32.420
nevertheless learned to fear the appearance of his brightly colored red airplane

28
00:01:32.421 --> 00:01:36.380
in the sky is the red Baron XE as commonly known has become a cultural

29
00:01:36.381 --> 00:01:37.670
touchstone easily,

30
00:01:37.671 --> 00:01:40.850
the most famous German soldier of the first world war and is one of the most

31
00:01:40.851 --> 00:01:42.920
celebrated fighter pilots of all time.

00:01:49.460 --> 00:01:52.160
<v 0>Fred Vaughn wrecked off and was born on the 2nd of May,</v>

34
00:01:52.190 --> 00:01:56.900
1892 near breasts law in lower say leisure, which is today part of Poland.

35
00:01:56.930 --> 00:02:00.560
He was part of a prominence Prussian aristocratic family or young gap.

36
00:02:00.590 --> 00:02:05.150
He has the Nobel titer fry ha which translates into Baron in English like many

37
00:02:05.151 --> 00:02:06.530
children of his social class.

38
00:02:07.190 --> 00:02:09.890
Richthofen was well-educated and excelled at outdoor pursuits,

39
00:02:09.891 --> 00:02:11.540
such as horseback riding and hunting.

40
00:02:11.570 --> 00:02:14.150
He was also well-regarded as a gymnast in school,

41
00:02:14.180 --> 00:02:18.440
particularly on the parallel bars where he was noted for his fast reflexes young

42
00:02:18.790 --> 00:02:21.470
mantra. It was destined for military service from a young age, beginning,

43
00:02:21.471 --> 00:02:26.120
his cadet training in 1904 at the age of 11, when he graduated in 1911,

44
00:02:26.121 --> 00:02:29.990
he received a commission into a cavalry regiments and appropriate posting for

45
00:02:29.991 --> 00:02:31.070
someone of his position,

46
00:02:31.130 --> 00:02:34.850
but he didn't have time to settle into peacetime military life for long.

47
00:02:40.790 --> 00:02:41.030
<v 1>[Inaudible].</v>

48
00:02:41.030 --> 00:02:41.870
<v 0>For hundreds of years,</v>

49
00:02:41.871 --> 00:02:45.020
the major powers of Europe sought to maintain a balance of power with each

50
00:02:45.021 --> 00:02:47.630
other. After the defeat of Napoleon in 1815,

51
00:02:47.631 --> 00:02:51.650
this was achieved by an almost constantly shifting series of alliances between

52
00:02:51.651 --> 00:02:54.200
the principle countries of Europe, with a few exceptions,

53
00:02:54.410 --> 00:02:57.680
this complicated system work to maintain peace throughout the continents over

54
00:02:57.681 --> 00:03:01.960
the course of the following hundred, but the Apple cart was upset in 1871.

55
00:03:01.961 --> 00:03:04.960
When Prussia joined together with many of the surrounding German speaking

56
00:03:04.961 --> 00:03:08.470
provinces to form the German empire with the former King of Prussia.

57
00:03:08.500 --> 00:03:10.450
Now the German emperor Kaiser,

58
00:03:10.510 --> 00:03:14.170
the new state sought to assert itself as a major player in world affairs,

59
00:03:14.171 --> 00:03:18.340
building a substantial military force and just pushing a colonial empire in

60
00:03:18.341 --> 00:03:19.630
Africa and East Asia,

61
00:03:19.890 --> 00:03:23.410
this alarms France and great Britain who formed an Alliance with each other and

62
00:03:23.590 --> 00:03:26.320
with the Russian empire to defend against German aggression,

63
00:03:26.560 --> 00:03:28.900
Germany in turn allied itself with its Southern neighbor,

64
00:03:28.930 --> 00:03:30.490
the Austro-Hungarian empire,

65
00:03:30.520 --> 00:03:34.120
the balance of power was maintained in this way at the start of the 20th

66
00:03:34.121 --> 00:03:34.691
century,

67
00:03:34.691 --> 00:03:38.950
but it meant that any regional conflict involving any of the major powers would

68
00:03:38.951 --> 00:03:41.770
quickly escalate into a continent spanning war.

69
00:03:41.830 --> 00:03:45.250
That was exactly what happened in the summer of 1914 when the Austro-Hungarian

70
00:03:45.730 --> 00:03:50.080
embar blamed Serbia for the assassination of the air to the Austrian throne and

71
00:03:50.081 --> 00:03:54.190
declared war Serbia was allied with Russia who declared war on Austria errands

72
00:03:54.670 --> 00:03:56.680
that dragged everyone else into the conflicts.

73
00:03:56.681 --> 00:04:00.430
And for the first time in a hundred years, the entirety of Europe was at war.

74
00:04:00.520 --> 00:04:03.430
Military technology had changed drastically in the last hundred years,

75
00:04:03.431 --> 00:04:07.090
and it quickly became apparent that cavalry regiments were worse than useless

76
00:04:07.091 --> 00:04:10.240
against machine guns and trench warfare, the German cover units,

77
00:04:10.420 --> 00:04:14.080
all dismounted and utilized in support roles behind the front lines.

78
00:04:14.680 --> 00:04:18.370
Manfred Von Rex, often chafed at the Sega to get into combat himself.

79
00:04:18.490 --> 00:04:20.380
His Johns came in May, 1915.

80
00:04:20.381 --> 00:04:23.410
When he received a transfer to the Imperial Gemini service,

81
00:04:23.620 --> 00:04:26.800
the young Baron was going to learn how to fly airplanes.

82
00:04:32.820 --> 00:04:33.150
<v 1>[Inaudible].</v>

83
00:04:33.150 --> 00:04:36.540
<v 0>Rick dolphin had joins the German air force at a time of great transition in</v>

84
00:04:36.541 --> 00:04:37.560
aviation history.

85
00:04:37.710 --> 00:04:41.490
All of the major combatants were trying to figure out how to best employ this

86
00:04:41.491 --> 00:04:43.740
new technology in the war effort.

87
00:04:43.830 --> 00:04:46.950
The obvious answer was to Mount machine guns on the planes,

88
00:04:46.951 --> 00:04:48.930
but the engine is still needed to overcome.

89
00:04:48.931 --> 00:04:52.860
There are the glaring problem of avoiding shooting off your own propeller when

90
00:04:53.040 --> 00:04:56.700
firing the gun directly forwards, the Germans figured it out first,

91
00:04:56.730 --> 00:04:59.430
they invented the synchronization gear mechanism.

92
00:04:59.460 --> 00:05:02.460
That's allowed the machine guns to find between the blades of the propeller.

93
00:05:02.700 --> 00:05:07.170
This gave them an initial period of air superiority known as the Fokker scourge

94
00:05:07.350 --> 00:05:10.320
before long purpose built fighter planes were being produced.

95
00:05:10.321 --> 00:05:14.070
And the war in the air escalated as pilots started trying to shoot down each

96
00:05:14.071 --> 00:05:15.720
other. In August, 1916,

97
00:05:15.750 --> 00:05:19.050
Richthofen was flying to see to bomber planes on the Eastern front.

98
00:05:19.050 --> 00:05:21.030
When he was visited by Oswald bulkhead,

99
00:05:21.540 --> 00:05:24.870
Boca was looking for pilots to join his newly formed fighter squadron.

100
00:05:24.871 --> 00:05:28.560
And he signed up rich orphan Boko was a legend in the German air force.

101
00:05:28.590 --> 00:05:31.710
He was the original fighter race having shot down 40 planes.

102
00:05:31.890 --> 00:05:35.670
It was also one of the first pilots to develop aerial tactics for his squadron,

103
00:05:35.820 --> 00:05:40.500
developing a series of maxims known as dicta bulker that became standard

104
00:05:40.501 --> 00:05:44.160
practice for all pilots in the first world war things like flying with the sun

105
00:05:44.161 --> 00:05:46.200
behind you. So your enemy can't see you coming,

106
00:05:46.201 --> 00:05:50.370
attacking from behind at close range and attacking in a formation.

107
00:05:50.400 --> 00:05:54.420
Instead of as individual planes breaks open would take the dicta Boca to heart

108
00:05:54.450 --> 00:05:58.580
very early in his fighting career and gave him credit for why he was so

109
00:05:58.581 --> 00:05:59.810
successful over,

110
00:05:59.880 --> 00:06:04.340
got his furnace confirmed scale on September the 17th of 1916 and had shot down

111
00:06:04.370 --> 00:06:06.560
five more by October the 28th,

112
00:06:06.561 --> 00:06:10.280
when Oswald Boga was killed in a mid-air collision with another Jeman plane.

113
00:06:10.340 --> 00:06:15.140
By January, 1917, he had shot down 16 planes and received the Paul and Marines.

114
00:06:15.170 --> 00:06:17.330
Germany's highest award for gallantry.

115
00:06:17.450 --> 00:06:19.970
Also known as the blue max that same month,

116
00:06:19.971 --> 00:06:21.560
he was named commander of his own squadron,

117
00:06:22.040 --> 00:06:26.120
yester 11 and last embarked on the path of becoming a legend.

118
00:06:26.570 --> 00:06:29.420
And if you're looking to become absolutely legendary,

119
00:06:29.660 --> 00:06:32.870
you need to join today's sponsor Skillshare and online learning community for

121
00:06:36.441 --> 00:06:40.340
unlike some websites where you have to pay the individual classes with a premium

122
00:06:40.341 --> 00:06:42.920
membership from Skillshare, you get unlimited access.

123
00:06:42.921 --> 00:06:44.270
So you can take as many as you want,

124
00:06:44.271 --> 00:06:47.960
which is pretty nice on someone who will just jump into a particular part of a

125
00:06:47.961 --> 00:06:49.430
classic extract.

126
00:06:49.460 --> 00:06:53.480
The information I need from just that little section and move on to something

127
00:06:53.481 --> 00:06:54.920
else. I mean, if the rest of the class is great,

128
00:06:54.921 --> 00:06:56.060
then maybe I'll see the other stuff,

129
00:06:56.061 --> 00:06:58.490
but really I'm looking to solve a specific problem.

130
00:06:58.670 --> 00:07:01.310
There are however classes that I've taken all the way through,

131
00:07:01.311 --> 00:07:03.650
which are particularly good. I'd recommend those.

132
00:07:03.651 --> 00:07:06.470
There was one on email productivity from Alexandra, Samuel.

133
00:07:06.710 --> 00:07:08.300
That is well worth a look.

134
00:07:08.360 --> 00:07:12.170
If your email inbox was as disastrous as mine,

135
00:07:12.171 --> 00:07:16.400
there's also building good habits with Thomas Frank, another great one. Anyway,

139
00:07:24.560 --> 00:07:27.440
And it's often that it's only around $10 a month.

<v 1>[Inaudible].</v>

141
00:07:34.660 --> 00:07:38.620
<v 0>Soon after assuming command of yester 11 Rex often got the idea in his head to</v>

142
00:07:38.621 --> 00:07:42.610
paint his airplane bright red. No one is really sure why he did it,

143
00:07:42.640 --> 00:07:46.660
but words soon spread across Europe and allied pilots grew to fear the

144
00:07:46.661 --> 00:07:48.070
appearance of rich orphans,

145
00:07:48.071 --> 00:07:51.730
red app line and battle as it usually meant death to his enemies,

146
00:07:51.790 --> 00:07:53.260
German newspapers on the other hand,

147
00:07:53.261 --> 00:07:56.290
loved the pain job and they soon began referring to him as

148
00:07:58.000 --> 00:08:00.610
[inaudible] the red fighter pilots. There was the allies,

149
00:08:00.611 --> 00:08:03.880
however that bestowed upon him, his most famous nickname,

150
00:08:04.270 --> 00:08:07.630
the red Baron yester 11 began to rack up aircraft skills.

151
00:08:07.631 --> 00:08:10.900
And Rick Trophon led the way during bloody April,

152
00:08:10.900 --> 00:08:15.040
1917 ratio often shown down 22 British planes, including four in a single day.

153
00:08:15.310 --> 00:08:17.590
You now had 52 aerial victories.

154
00:08:17.800 --> 00:08:21.280
You assumed promoted again to command of a fighter wing of four squadrons.

155
00:08:21.310 --> 00:08:25.150
The other German pilots seeking to emulate the Baron began painting their planes

156
00:08:25.240 --> 00:08:26.830
in various bright colors as well.

157
00:08:27.070 --> 00:08:30.670
The outgoing soon became known as rector orphans flying circus,

158
00:08:31.030 --> 00:08:35.110
which often was a master of the very difficult and dangerous crafts in the first

159
00:08:35.111 --> 00:08:36.280
world war as at-home.

160
00:08:36.281 --> 00:08:39.190
That was a game of high-stakes maneuvers conducted at close range.

161
00:08:39.220 --> 00:08:41.350
When squadrons of planes engaged each other,

162
00:08:41.360 --> 00:08:43.960
they broke off into a series of one-on-one engagements.

163
00:08:43.961 --> 00:08:48.100
The pilots called dogfights. The goal was to get directly behind your opponents,

164
00:08:48.101 --> 00:08:49.960
also known as being in the planes,

165
00:08:49.990 --> 00:08:54.310
six o'clock position and fire your machine gun at close range since the gums

166
00:08:54.311 --> 00:08:57.960
were fairly. And is that farther away? You were the worst. It would go.

167
00:08:58.140 --> 00:09:00.690
You did this until it damaged. The plane so much fell out the sky,

168
00:09:00.691 --> 00:09:01.830
or you shot the pilot.

169
00:09:02.070 --> 00:09:05.430
This was not as easy as you might sink cause these planes had an open cockpit,

170
00:09:05.460 --> 00:09:09.390
meaning the pilots were exposed to wind speeds in excess of 150 kilometers per

171
00:09:09.391 --> 00:09:12.840
hour. In frigid. Temperatures often compounded by wet weather.

172
00:09:12.900 --> 00:09:15.480
You had to pay attention to both the instruments in the cockpit,

173
00:09:15.481 --> 00:09:16.440
as well as the air space,

174
00:09:16.441 --> 00:09:19.710
all around you to avoid crashing into the ground or other aircraft.

175
00:09:19.890 --> 00:09:23.520
And of course you have to contend with the fact that people on both the grounds

176
00:09:23.580 --> 00:09:26.190
and in other planes were shooting at you.

177
00:09:26.730 --> 00:09:30.480
Rick Hoffman was not a particularly acrobatic flier leaving the complicated

178
00:09:30.481 --> 00:09:33.360
maneuvers to pilots like his younger brother, Luther,

179
00:09:33.540 --> 00:09:36.840
where he excelled was his skill as a tactician and a marksman.

180
00:09:36.990 --> 00:09:40.200
He didn't have to out fly as enemies when he could out smart and down shoot

181
00:09:40.201 --> 00:09:40.440
them.

182
00:09:40.440 --> 00:09:44.670
He was also noted for his chivalrous conduct once he was sure the enemy plane

183
00:09:44.671 --> 00:09:47.790
was crippled. He stopped shooting out S he avoided strafing downs.

184
00:09:47.791 --> 00:09:51.690
Pilots who survived that crash landing calling himself a sportsman,

185
00:09:51.900 --> 00:09:54.090
not a butcher. He insisted on entertaining,

186
00:09:54.091 --> 00:09:57.270
captured allied pilots with dinner and drinks before they were sent off to

187
00:09:57.271 --> 00:09:58.260
prisoner of war camps.

188
00:09:58.290 --> 00:10:02.550
This was considered to be proper behavior by something that was expected from a

189
00:10:02.551 --> 00:10:03.384
German nobleman.

190
00:10:10.100 --> 00:10:10.130
<v 1>[Inaudible].</v>

191
00:10:10.130 --> 00:10:13.430
<v 0>I was seriously wounded in the hat on July the sixth, 1917,</v>

192
00:10:13.431 --> 00:10:16.940
while flying a combat mission. Those suffering from temporary partial blindness,

193
00:10:16.970 --> 00:10:21.170
he was able to force his airplanes land essentially intact behind German lines

194
00:10:21.171 --> 00:10:23.450
in Belgium. Before being rushed to a hospital,

195
00:10:23.510 --> 00:10:26.660
doctors have to perform several surgeries to remove skull fragments from his

196
00:10:26.661 --> 00:10:30.980
brain. He was able to recover enough to be back in the cockpit by July the 25th,

197
00:10:31.010 --> 00:10:32.960
but the headaches and post-flight nausea,

198
00:10:32.990 --> 00:10:36.560
he suffered in the aftermath was so bad that he was forced to take medical leave

199
00:10:36.710 --> 00:10:40.160
for almost two months in the fall of 1917, while grounded,

200
00:10:40.190 --> 00:10:44.160
rich often authored an autobiography that was heavily censored and edited by

201
00:10:44.210 --> 00:10:48.410
German propagandists to paint the war and his actions in a proper

202
00:10:48.500 --> 00:10:51.050
patriotic and positive light. By this time,

203
00:10:51.051 --> 00:10:54.650
the German government was sanctioning a cult of hero worship based around the

204
00:10:54.710 --> 00:10:56.720
leading German fighter raises in general.

205
00:10:56.720 --> 00:11:00.470
And Rick's often in particular newspapers, printed stories of his exploits.

206
00:11:00.530 --> 00:11:04.280
Every time he claimed to kill it was front page news, some newspapers,

207
00:11:04.281 --> 00:11:05.330
even at score sheets,

208
00:11:05.331 --> 00:11:09.350
tallying the kill totals of the top German pilots with Rex often by now at the

209
00:11:09.351 --> 00:11:09.800
top,

210
00:11:09.800 --> 00:11:13.130
soldiers in the trenches could be found carrying his picture in their pockets.

211
00:11:13.131 --> 00:11:16.760
And he was swarmed by well-wishes and fans, wherever he went,

212
00:11:16.970 --> 00:11:19.790
that was serious consideration to grounding in permanently,

213
00:11:20.000 --> 00:11:22.640
as he was held in such high regard by the German people,

214
00:11:22.641 --> 00:11:26.330
that it was fair to that his death in combat would weaken public morale,

215
00:11:26.450 --> 00:11:28.640
perhaps jeopardizing the entire war effort.

216
00:11:28.700 --> 00:11:30.320
But Rick Trophon wouldn't hear of it.

217
00:11:30.440 --> 00:11:32.990
He argued that like a common soldier in the trenches.

218
00:11:33.140 --> 00:11:37.250
He must take his chances like everyone else rich often returned to the air in

219
00:11:37.251 --> 00:11:40.550
November, 1917, but he did it in the cockpit of a new airplane.

220
00:11:40.640 --> 00:11:44.870
The Fokker [inaudible] was much more powerful than anything the Germans had

221
00:11:44.871 --> 00:11:45.621
flown before.

222
00:11:45.621 --> 00:11:49.310
And Rick Hoffman immediately recommended that the entire air force be equipped

223
00:11:49.311 --> 00:11:50.990
with them as soon as possible.

224
00:11:51.020 --> 00:11:55.060
It is this image that of the red painted airplane that has come to be most

225
00:11:55.061 --> 00:11:56.110
associated with the rail.

226
00:12:02.880 --> 00:12:04.110
In the spring of 1918,

227
00:12:04.111 --> 00:12:08.970
Germany made a bid to win the war with one decisive blow in late 1917 Russia.

228
00:12:09.000 --> 00:12:12.540
Now under the control of Lennon and the communists signed a peace treaty with

229
00:12:12.541 --> 00:12:16.200
the central powers ending the war on the Eastern front. At the same time,

230
00:12:16.201 --> 00:12:19.410
the United States of America rendered the war on the side of the allies,

231
00:12:19.470 --> 00:12:20.940
general Erich Ludendorff.

232
00:12:20.970 --> 00:12:24.720
Now the leading figure in most of the German war effort knew that rapidly

233
00:12:24.721 --> 00:12:28.350
transferring troops from East to West and smashing the allied position on the

234
00:12:28.351 --> 00:12:32.520
Western front before the Americans could arrive in force was essential in March.

235
00:12:32.550 --> 00:12:34.110
They launched their spring offensive,

236
00:12:34.111 --> 00:12:37.020
breaking through the allied lines and racing towards Paris.

237
00:12:37.230 --> 00:12:39.990
The war in the app was considered important to this offensive.

238
00:12:39.991 --> 00:12:43.500
So Retrophin often squadrons were busy and a little less than a month wrecked

239
00:12:43.600 --> 00:12:45.450
off, often shot down 15 allied planes,

240
00:12:45.451 --> 00:12:49.500
including several of the new British built Sopwith camels that were built

241
00:12:49.501 --> 00:12:53.700
specifically to counter the air superiority that Rick Hoffman squadrons had

242
00:12:53.701 --> 00:12:56.130
enjoyed in 1917 on April the 20th,

243
00:12:56.131 --> 00:13:00.420
1918 during a dogfight retrofit and shutdown to camels within three minutes of

244
00:13:00.421 --> 00:13:04.980
each other, scoring is 79th and 80th kills the next day, April 21st,

245
00:13:05.280 --> 00:13:05.611
RET orphans,

246
00:13:05.611 --> 00:13:09.840
cousin Wolfram was joining them on his first mission because he was new retrofit

247
00:13:09.870 --> 00:13:12.060
audit his cousin to stay out of the fighting.

248
00:13:12.090 --> 00:13:13.800
And when contact was made with the enemy,

249
00:13:13.801 --> 00:13:18.030
he was to circle and watch the battle from above at 11:00 AM. Erected orphans,

250
00:13:18.450 --> 00:13:21.750
planes tangled with the 209th squadron of the Royal air force commanded by

251
00:13:21.751 --> 00:13:25.770
captain Roy Brown Wolfram on at react often did what his cousin had ordered and

252
00:13:25.771 --> 00:13:28.680
circled above the freight. As it happens. One of the RAF pilots,

253
00:13:29.040 --> 00:13:32.100
Wilfred may had been ordered by captain Brown to do the same thing as he was

254
00:13:32.101 --> 00:13:35.250
also new may Saul Wolfram's plane, all by itself,

255
00:13:35.251 --> 00:13:37.590
near his position and decided to attack him.

256
00:13:37.710 --> 00:13:40.110
The red Baron looked top and soar his cousin under attack,

257
00:13:40.111 --> 00:13:43.560
and immediately flew to his rescue at firing on Mae and forcing him to break

258
00:13:43.561 --> 00:13:46.380
away from the fight raked off and continued to Jace may,

259
00:13:46.381 --> 00:13:48.240
as he descended towards the grounds.

260
00:13:48.300 --> 00:13:51.060
Captain Roy Brown saw what was happening and attempted to intervene,

261
00:13:51.210 --> 00:13:55.380
firing a burst at Richt orphan from above before having to pull up shortly to

262
00:13:55.381 --> 00:13:56.370
avoid hitting the ground.

263
00:13:56.730 --> 00:14:00.840
Rich often briefly moved to avoid Brown's attacks and inexplicably turned to go

264
00:14:00.841 --> 00:14:01.740
after may again,

265
00:14:01.741 --> 00:14:05.310
despite the British pilots being fallen away from the battle and dangerously

266
00:14:05.311 --> 00:14:07.650
close to the ground that was occupied by allied soldiers.

267
00:14:07.770 --> 00:14:09.630
There are many theories as do I react often,

268
00:14:09.660 --> 00:14:13.710
always the cautious and meticulous piloted behaved in this reckless way.

269
00:14:13.740 --> 00:14:16.890
Some things that he would have braided his subordinates for it is believed that

270
00:14:16.891 --> 00:14:19.950
the head injury that raked off and had suffered in July,

271
00:14:19.950 --> 00:14:23.520
1917 had caused permanent brain damage impacting his ability to make rational

272
00:14:24.090 --> 00:14:27.990
judgements about what was safe and what wasn't his target fixation amaze plane

273
00:14:28.170 --> 00:14:30.870
is a possible indicator of this brain damage.

274
00:14:30.960 --> 00:14:35.520
He may have also been suffering from acute combat stress and overload based on

275
00:14:35.760 --> 00:14:37.680
two continuous years of Ariel combats,

276
00:14:37.681 --> 00:14:42.000
watching his closest friends and comrades die in the near fatal maiming of his

277
00:14:42.001 --> 00:14:44.460
brother. This could have put him in a disassociative,

278
00:14:44.490 --> 00:14:48.660
perhaps even suicidal state where either he wasn't aware of the danger posed or

279
00:14:48.661 --> 00:14:49.650
simply didn't cap.

280
00:14:49.830 --> 00:14:53.210
It is also entirely that with the spring offensive in full motion,

281
00:14:53.360 --> 00:14:57.770
Rachel didn't realize where the front lines were and didn't know he had strayed

282
00:14:57.771 --> 00:14:58.790
into enemy territory,

283
00:14:58.910 --> 00:15:01.460
or it could have been a combination of all of these factors.

284
00:15:01.790 --> 00:15:03.350
There's really no way to know.

285
00:15:03.470 --> 00:15:06.650
What we do know is that shortly after avoiding the attack by captain Brown,

286
00:15:06.890 --> 00:15:10.520
Rick Tovan was fought on by soldiers on the grounds with both rifles and machine

287
00:15:10.521 --> 00:15:11.120
guns.

288
00:15:11.120 --> 00:15:14.780
A single bullet struck Ricks often from behind causing massive damage to his

289
00:15:14.781 --> 00:15:16.670
vital organs. He was able to land his,

290
00:15:16.671 --> 00:15:20.090
try playing in the field near the som river controlled by Australian troops.

291
00:15:20.300 --> 00:15:23.240
Some of them rushed to his plane, but by the time they arrived,

292
00:15:23.360 --> 00:15:26.360
the red Baron was dead. Two weeks shy of his 26 bucks.

293
00:15:28.090 --> 00:15:32.820
<v 3>Uh, uh.</v>

294
00:15:33.230 --> 00:15:36.610
<v 0>Squadron of the Australian Royal flying Corps took responsibility for rich</v>

295
00:15:36.940 --> 00:15:39.730
orphans body. Most allied pilots greatly respected the barons.

296
00:15:39.910 --> 00:15:43.420
The Australians honored him the next day by burying him with full military

297
00:15:43.421 --> 00:15:45.610
honors that a small cemetery outside of amnion.

298
00:15:45.990 --> 00:15:47.590
Many other squadrons sent wreaths,

299
00:15:47.591 --> 00:15:52.240
including one that was inscribed to our gallons and worthy foe just as the

300
00:15:52.241 --> 00:15:56.110
German government feared the death of man tread Von direct often was met with

301
00:15:56.111 --> 00:15:59.530
widespread shock and dispatch the spring offensive fizzled out soon after his

302
00:15:59.531 --> 00:16:00.580
death. And over the summer,

303
00:16:00.590 --> 00:16:04.420
the allies began to regain all the territory the Germans had taken and then

304
00:16:04.570 --> 00:16:08.050
collapsed their main defensive line, pushing them back toward Germany itself.

305
00:16:08.170 --> 00:16:11.620
This call has rots in Berlin that forced the Kaiser to abdicate and for the

306
00:16:11.621 --> 00:16:13.300
German government to Sue for peace.

307
00:16:13.360 --> 00:16:16.210
The first world war ended on November the 11th, 1918.

308
00:16:16.480 --> 00:16:18.760
When the armistice came into effect rich orphans,

309
00:16:18.970 --> 00:16:21.640
tri plane was torn apart by souvenir hunters. In fact,

310
00:16:21.670 --> 00:16:24.460
none of his planes are believed to exist in tact today.

311
00:16:24.670 --> 00:16:25.630
His planes at that arrow,

312
00:16:25.631 --> 00:16:30.280
a considerably more fragile than the aluminum built planes of later generations.

313
00:16:30.400 --> 00:16:33.760
Captain Roy Brown was officially credited with shooting down Richthofens plane.

314
00:16:33.910 --> 00:16:37.510
Although modern historical consensus is that Rick Hoffman was actually killed by

315
00:16:37.511 --> 00:16:38.260
ground flop.

316
00:16:38.260 --> 00:16:41.470
Wolfram Von Rick dolphins survived to the end of the war and would go on to

317
00:16:41.471 --> 00:16:44.800
become a senior commands or in the German Luftwaffe during world war II,

318
00:16:44.980 --> 00:16:48.550
rich dolphin's body was moved three times from its original resting place.

319
00:16:48.670 --> 00:16:53.080
In the early 1920s Richter often was moved by the French to a military cemetery

320
00:16:53.200 --> 00:16:55.060
and frequent. Then in 1925,

321
00:16:55.061 --> 00:16:58.930
his brother Boko had the remains taken to Germany to be buried in Berlin, uh,

322
00:16:59.050 --> 00:17:02.260
to military cemetery, along with many other famous German soldiers.

323
00:17:02.350 --> 00:17:05.800
The cemetery was situated on the border between West and East Berlin during the

324
00:17:05.801 --> 00:17:07.300
cold war and rich orphans,

325
00:17:07.960 --> 00:17:10.570
gravestone suffered damage from bullets fired by Soviet gods,

326
00:17:10.571 --> 00:17:14.140
trying to prevent people from crossing the Berlin wall in 1975,

327
00:17:14.141 --> 00:17:18.460
the rich orphan family moved his body to a family plot in the West German city

328
00:17:18.461 --> 00:17:20.590
of Wiesbaden, where it is today.

329
00:17:20.740 --> 00:17:24.070
Rick softens larger than life persona persisted. Well after his death,

330
00:17:24.360 --> 00:17:27.340
he is one of the most recognizable figures of the first world war and perhaps

331
00:17:27.341 --> 00:17:29.410
one of the most famous fighter pilots of all time.

332
00:17:29.680 --> 00:17:33.130
The name red Baron is something that most everyone has heard,

333
00:17:33.340 --> 00:17:37.120
even if they don't know anything about the real life Manfred vulnerary it often

334
00:17:37.510 --> 00:17:40.480
prompts the most indelible way he has been immortalized is by the comic book

335
00:17:40.481 --> 00:17:43.240
strip peanuts in the comics, Snoopy often imagines.

336
00:17:43.241 --> 00:17:48.160
He is flying a Sopwith camel, which is actually as doghouse and his great rival.

337
00:17:48.161 --> 00:17:52.260
The red Baron continually shoots him down much to Snoopy's chagrin.

338
00:17:52.920 --> 00:17:56.340
Manfred Von Richter often had an out-sized impact on aviation history.

339
00:17:56.640 --> 00:18:00.330
He helps lay the foundation for future fighter pilots to follow inventing

340
00:18:00.331 --> 00:18:03.750
tactics that are still taught to military pilots a hundred years later.

341
00:18:03.930 --> 00:18:07.410
More than that helped forge the image of the fighter pilots into the public

342
00:18:07.411 --> 00:18:10.020
consciousness in the modern mechanical horrors of war.

343
00:18:10.140 --> 00:18:14.250
He was the last night he obeyed the ancient code of chivalry and treated as

344
00:18:14.251 --> 00:18:18.120
enemies with respect to Donna. He may have died tragically at the age of 25,

345
00:18:18.121 --> 00:18:23.010
but his actions and persona have ensured that his name and deeds will live

346
00:18:23.011 --> 00:18:26.430
on forever. So I really hope you found that video. Interesting. If you did,
