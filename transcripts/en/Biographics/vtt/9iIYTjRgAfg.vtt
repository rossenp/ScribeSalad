00:00:13.351 --> 00:00:15.300
description below more on them in a bit.

6
00:00:21.650 --> 00:00:25.070
In 1993, Tommy Lee Jones famously gave his speech,

7
00:00:25.160 --> 00:00:27.200
or I listen up ladies and gentlemen,

8
00:00:27.590 --> 00:00:29.960
our fugitive has been on the run for 90 minutes.

9
00:00:30.020 --> 00:00:34.520
Average foot speed over uneven grounds, barring injuries, four miles an hour.

10
00:00:34.610 --> 00:00:36.260
That gives us a radius of six miles.

11
00:00:36.650 --> 00:00:41.600
What I want out of each and every one of you is a hard target search of every

12
00:00:41.601 --> 00:00:44.210
gas station residents, warehouse, farmhouse, hand, house,

13
00:00:44.540 --> 00:00:49.220
out house and dog house in that area, check points go up 15 miles.

14
00:00:49.280 --> 00:00:52.040
Your fugitive's name is Dr. Richard Kimball.

15
00:00:52.520 --> 00:00:56.180
Go get him that is taken from the smash hit movie. The fugitive,

16
00:00:56.181 --> 00:01:00.230
which wedding zones will be nominated for seven Academy awards and became one of

17
00:01:00.231 --> 00:01:02.360
the greatest action films of the 1990s.

18
00:01:02.570 --> 00:01:05.900
It told the story of Dr. Richard kibble played by Harrison Ford,

19
00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:09.800
who was forced to go on the run after being falsely convicted of the murder of

20
00:01:09.801 --> 00:01:13.820
his wife. When in fact the killer had been a mysterious one-armed man,

21
00:01:13.970 --> 00:01:17.390
some fans of the film might be unaware that the fugitive was originally a

22
00:01:17.391 --> 00:01:19.400
television show back in the 1960s.

23
00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:23.960
Even fewer fans may know that the show had been inspired by the sensationalistic

24
00:01:23.990 --> 00:01:26.780
real life murder trial of Dr. Sam shepherd,

25
00:01:26.781 --> 00:01:29.210
who also stood accused of killing his wife.

26
00:01:29.360 --> 00:01:31.760
Just to clarify the creator of the original TV show,

27
00:01:31.761 --> 00:01:34.670
Roy Huggins denied any connection between the two,

28
00:01:34.790 --> 00:01:38.780
although other people involved like the network executive who add the show and

29
00:01:38.930 --> 00:01:40.580
the lawyer in the real case,

30
00:01:40.581 --> 00:01:45.290
both argued that they were definitely related where the Huggins was inspired by

31
00:01:45.291 --> 00:01:48.230
the real trial or not is besides the points,

32
00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:52.070
but it certainly would have been difficult for him not to have been aware of it

33
00:01:52.250 --> 00:01:53.510
because in its day,

34
00:01:53.630 --> 00:01:58.550
there were few other better examples of a media circus than the Sam shepherd

35
00:01:58.580 --> 00:01:59.120
trial.

36
00:01:59.120 --> 00:02:02.960
Even the United States Supreme court to create the proceedings for having a

37
00:02:02.961 --> 00:02:07.910
carnival atmosphere and criticize the media for conducting trial by newspaper

38
00:02:07.911 --> 00:02:11.870
and concluding that Sam shepherd was guilty before it even been brought in for

39
00:02:11.871 --> 00:02:12.770
an interrogation.

40
00:02:12.860 --> 00:02:16.370
So today we're exploring one of the most famous murder cases in American

41
00:02:16.371 --> 00:02:20.840
history. As we examine the death of Marilyn shattered, followed by the arrest,

42
00:02:21.020 --> 00:02:25.850
the trial and the long road to exoneration for her. Husband's Dr. Sam shack.

43
00:02:29.390 --> 00:02:30.223
<v 1>[Inaudible].</v>

44
00:02:33.020 --> 00:02:36.230
<v 0>Shepherd was born on December the 29th, 1923 in Cleveland, Ohio,</v>

45
00:02:36.290 --> 00:02:38.840
right from the outset. He seemingly possessed everything.

46
00:02:38.990 --> 00:02:41.780
He needed to lead a successful life. He came from a good family.

47
00:02:41.810 --> 00:02:43.460
He was smart and athletic,

48
00:02:43.461 --> 00:02:47.330
and he was voted most likely to succeed in his senior year of high school.

49
00:02:47.360 --> 00:02:50.510
Once he graduated, he decided to follow in the footsteps of his father,

50
00:02:51.170 --> 00:02:53.720
Richard Allen shepherds, and become a doctor of osteopathic medicine.

51
00:02:53.721 --> 00:02:58.160
So he enrolled at the Los Angeles college of osteopathic physicians and surgeons

52
00:02:58.220 --> 00:03:00.190
just a quick side half and say clarity.

53
00:03:00.191 --> 00:03:03.670
The American medical world makes a clear distinction between doctors of

54
00:03:03.671 --> 00:03:07.840
osteopathic medicine also known as osteopathic physicians and people who are

55
00:03:07.841 --> 00:03:09.220
simply called osteopaths.

56
00:03:09.250 --> 00:03:12.070
The format requires a degree from an approved medical school,

57
00:03:12.250 --> 00:03:15.730
and they're able to practice the same scope of modern medicine as medical

58
00:03:15.731 --> 00:03:16.301
doctors,

59
00:03:16.301 --> 00:03:21.040
which includes performing surgeries and writing prescriptions osteopaths do

60
00:03:21.041 --> 00:03:25.870
not in 1945 shepherd attains his degree in osteopathic medicine and was now Dr.

61
00:03:25.870 --> 00:03:27.940
Sam shepherd DEO for a while.

62
00:03:27.941 --> 00:03:32.140
He stayed in Los Angeles and worked at the County hospital. However, in 1951,

63
00:03:32.141 --> 00:03:34.600
he went back to Ohio to join the family practice.

64
00:03:34.810 --> 00:03:38.290
His father had purchased the Washington Lauren's mansion in Bay village,

65
00:03:38.650 --> 00:03:40.330
affluent suburb of Cleveland,

66
00:03:40.331 --> 00:03:45.310
and turned it into an osteopathic medical center called Bayview hospital during

67
00:03:45.311 --> 00:03:47.200
his time out in Los Angeles, Sam Shepard,

68
00:03:47.290 --> 00:03:49.870
and also married his high school sweetheart in and Reese.

69
00:03:49.871 --> 00:03:53.530
And the couple had already had a young son called Samuel Reese shepherd.

70
00:03:53.710 --> 00:03:55.420
By the time their returns are higher,

71
00:03:55.480 --> 00:03:59.050
they also had a dog called Coco who actually went on to play an important role

72
00:03:59.080 --> 00:04:02.380
during the trial. Nobody had heard the dog barks the night of the crime.

73
00:04:02.530 --> 00:04:06.340
So the prosecution argued that that meant there were no strangers in the house.

74
00:04:06.550 --> 00:04:10.210
Anyway, the point yet is that the shepherd seemed to have a charmed life,

75
00:04:10.270 --> 00:04:14.860
but as was revealed later during the trial all was not well behind closed

76
00:04:14.861 --> 00:04:15.310
doors.

77
00:04:15.310 --> 00:04:19.270
Dr. Shepherd was having an affair with a nurse from his hospital named Susan

78
00:04:19.270 --> 00:04:21.280
Hayes. And according to multiple testimonies,

79
00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:24.130
Marilyn was aware of this by the doctor's own admission.

80
00:04:24.220 --> 00:04:25.750
The couple were having marital troubles.

81
00:04:26.140 --> 00:04:29.710
They intended to work them out and divorce was never really considered,

82
00:04:29.800 --> 00:04:32.830
especially since Marilyn was already pregnant with their second child,

83
00:04:39.630 --> 00:04:41.220
Beginning of July, the third, 1954,

84
00:04:41.221 --> 00:04:44.670
the shepherds were entertaining guests at their house. They were their homes,

85
00:04:44.820 --> 00:04:46.770
family that lived in the neighborhood. After dinner.

86
00:04:46.890 --> 00:04:50.130
The group went to the living room where they started watching the movie strange

87
00:04:50.131 --> 00:04:53.670
holiday on TV. At one point, Sam Shepard fell asleep around midnight.

88
00:04:53.671 --> 00:04:56.190
The Akins went home and Maren and went upstairs to bed.

89
00:04:56.340 --> 00:04:58.890
Letting Sam sleep in the living room. A few hours later,

90
00:04:59.760 --> 00:05:03.840
Marilyn Shepherd was dead after having them brutally bludgeoned in her own bed.

91
00:05:03.990 --> 00:05:06.860
The first person to hear of this was a man called Spencer home,

92
00:05:07.080 --> 00:05:11.370
who was the mayor of Bay village and a friend of the shepherds at around 5:40

93
00:05:11.370 --> 00:05:15.300
AM. He received a distressed call from Sam shepherd to told him for, God's say,

94
00:05:15.780 --> 00:05:18.800
expand, get over here quick. I think they've killed Marilyn hokey.

95
00:05:18.801 --> 00:05:20.340
And his wife were first on the scene,

96
00:05:20.341 --> 00:05:23.040
followed closely by the police who arrived at the shepherd home.

97
00:05:23.040 --> 00:05:25.290
Shortly after 6:00 AM inside the house.

98
00:05:25.291 --> 00:05:28.980
Investigators found a trail of blood leading to Maryland Shepherd's body,

99
00:05:29.130 --> 00:05:31.230
as well as some signs of an apparent robbery.

100
00:05:31.320 --> 00:05:33.390
Seven-year-old Samuel had been sleeping in his room,

101
00:05:33.480 --> 00:05:36.960
unaware of the night's events and an uncle came and picked him up. Meanwhile,

102
00:05:36.961 --> 00:05:39.810
Sam Shepard Senia displayed various cuts and bruises,

103
00:05:39.811 --> 00:05:44.310
which resulted according to him from a fight with a killer whom he described

104
00:05:44.311 --> 00:05:47.970
only as being very bushy head showing signs of shock.

105
00:05:47.971 --> 00:05:51.780
He was sedated and sent to the hospital to get treated for neck injuries back at

106
00:05:51.781 --> 00:05:52.231
the house.

107
00:05:52.231 --> 00:05:56.550
The coroner Dr. Sam gabber arrived at 8:00 AM admins while going over the crime

108
00:05:56.551 --> 00:05:56.950
scene,

109
00:05:56.950 --> 00:06:00.710
he began immediately suspecting shepherd of murdering his wife a few hours

110
00:06:00.711 --> 00:06:03.260
later. Police interrogated the osteopathic physician,

111
00:06:03.440 --> 00:06:05.060
according to his version of events.

112
00:06:05.240 --> 00:06:09.020
He woke up during the night after hearing his wife screaming his name.

113
00:06:09.140 --> 00:06:12.680
He rushed upstairs, where he saw a stranger standing over the body of Maryland.

114
00:06:12.740 --> 00:06:13.610
The two fourths bus,

115
00:06:13.850 --> 00:06:17.090
the killer got the upper hand and briefly not shattered on unconscious before

116
00:06:17.091 --> 00:06:20.300
making a run for it. The doctor or woke after a short period,

117
00:06:20.450 --> 00:06:23.810
he went to check on his son who was sleeping in his own room and then ran

118
00:06:23.811 --> 00:06:25.850
outside, looking for the intruder shepherd,

119
00:06:25.851 --> 00:06:28.550
caught up to the killer on the shores of nearby Lake Erie.

120
00:06:28.580 --> 00:06:30.230
They then started brawling again,

121
00:06:30.231 --> 00:06:33.650
but the intruder proved stronger and knock shepherd unconscious. Once more,

122
00:06:33.740 --> 00:06:35.480
by the time the doctor came around the Bush,

123
00:06:35.481 --> 00:06:38.120
he had stranger had stolen his shirt and disappeared.

124
00:06:38.390 --> 00:06:41.270
So shepherd went inside and called Spencer hook.

125
00:06:41.450 --> 00:06:43.700
The police weren't really sold on this story.

126
00:06:43.850 --> 00:06:46.400
There were few signs of a break-in and signed the house.

127
00:06:46.430 --> 00:06:48.530
Nobody else heard or saw the struggle.

128
00:06:48.531 --> 00:06:51.980
And Dr. Shepherd's description of the killer was so vague that at certain

129
00:06:51.981 --> 00:06:55.370
points, he wasn't even sure if it was a man or a woman like doctor go about,

130
00:06:55.400 --> 00:06:58.970
they seem started suspecting Sam shepherd of murdering his wife.

131
00:06:59.150 --> 00:07:01.910
And so he did the newspapers unsurprisingly by the next day,

132
00:07:01.911 --> 00:07:05.090
the death of Marilyn Sheppard was on the front page of every newspaper in

133
00:07:05.091 --> 00:07:09.140
Cleveland. And a few days later in all of the higher cars started lining up.

134
00:07:09.141 --> 00:07:11.540
As people wanted to drive past the infamous shattered house,

135
00:07:11.810 --> 00:07:13.790
less than two weeks after the murder occurred,

136
00:07:13.820 --> 00:07:18.020
the media had already more or less proclaimed Sam Shepard to be guilty.

137
00:07:18.230 --> 00:07:20.930
Things got significantly worse for the doctor during the inquest.

138
00:07:20.931 --> 00:07:23.360
When his relationship with Susan Hayes was brought up,

139
00:07:23.690 --> 00:07:25.730
initially he denied having an affair with that,

140
00:07:25.731 --> 00:07:29.240
but she later fessed up to the whole thing when she was interviewed this not

141
00:07:29.241 --> 00:07:31.490
only proved that shepherd had lied to the police,

142
00:07:31.640 --> 00:07:35.000
but it also gave him a motive for wanting his wife out of the picture.

143
00:07:35.150 --> 00:07:38.420
Once word of this got out the Cleveland's press ran a story with the headline,

144
00:07:38.660 --> 00:07:42.200
why isn't Sam Shepard in jail. And that was on July the 30th,

145
00:07:42.201 --> 00:07:47.150
1954 later that same day police charged and arrested the doctor for the murder

146
00:07:47.390 --> 00:07:48.440
of Marilyn shepherds.

147
00:07:48.970 --> 00:07:51.670
We'll continue with the trial of the century in just a moment.

148
00:07:51.700 --> 00:07:55.360

00:08:56.610 --> 00:09:00.780
It was super easy to set up a beautiful elegant website in no time whatsoever,

168
00:09:00.990 --> 00:09:04.830
also super functional. It's perfect. That's the mega-projects dot net.

169
00:09:04.860 --> 00:09:08.040
If you want to take a look at what is possible with Squarespace,

170
00:09:08.220 --> 00:09:10.410
with someone who has no web skills whatsoever.

171
00:09:10.530 --> 00:09:12.480
So when you're ready to get started on the next project,

172
00:09:12.481 --> 00:09:15.900
if you'll as big or small, if the developers a website, do it with Squarespace,

175
00:09:22.561 --> 00:09:26.310
first purchase of a website or domain, and let's get back to it.

176
00:09:32.450 --> 00:09:35.360
<v 2>What followed was one of the most publicized trials in American history,</v>

177
00:09:35.420 --> 00:09:36.380
the preliminary hearing.

178
00:09:36.440 --> 00:09:39.830
<v 0>It took place in the first half of August after which shepherd was released on</v>

179
00:09:39.831 --> 00:09:42.800
bail on August the 16th. He didn't know it yet,

180
00:09:43.010 --> 00:09:46.580
but that would be the doctor's last day of freedom for almost a decade.

181
00:09:46.730 --> 00:09:50.180
The very next day, the grand jury returns an indictment of first degree murder.

182
00:09:50.450 --> 00:09:52.370
So shepherd was arrested again.

183
00:09:52.520 --> 00:09:56.060
The trial itself started halfway through October after the judge, in the case,

184
00:09:56.120 --> 00:10:00.500
Edward [inaudible] rejected a request from the defense to move the trial out of

185
00:10:00.501 --> 00:10:03.920
Cleveland, due to the extensive publicity. It received years later,

186
00:10:03.950 --> 00:10:08.240
the us Supreme court deemed this a mistake and criticize the judge for failing

187
00:10:08.241 --> 00:10:10.940
to control disruptive influences in the courtroom.

188
00:10:11.120 --> 00:10:15.140
Perhaps the most egregious examples were situations where he did not dismiss the

189
00:10:15.141 --> 00:10:17.510
jury, even though it would have been warranted,

190
00:10:17.660 --> 00:10:22.070
they had not been sequestered and were therefore exposed to sensationalized

191
00:10:22.071 --> 00:10:25.460
radio broadcasts that would have shaped their opinion of Sam shattered.

192
00:10:25.610 --> 00:10:28.940
On one particular occasion, two jurors admitted to listening to a broadcast,

193
00:10:28.941 --> 00:10:32.270
which said that a woman had been arrested in New York claiming that she was the

194
00:10:32.271 --> 00:10:35.060
mistress of Sam shepherd and that they had a child together.

195
00:10:35.330 --> 00:10:39.260
The judge found out about this and allowed the persons do continue serving on

196
00:10:39.261 --> 00:10:42.920
the jury. And worst of all, the claim was later proven to be false.

197
00:10:42.980 --> 00:10:45.800
The prosecution was led by John Mann during the trial.

198
00:10:45.830 --> 00:10:48.980
That was not a lot of actual evidence to indicate that shepherd was the

199
00:10:49.460 --> 00:10:50.990
culprits, the prosecution strategy,

200
00:10:50.991 --> 00:10:55.280
mainly involved using the doctors' affair to establish a motive and pointing out

201
00:10:55.281 --> 00:10:58.700
the inconsistencies in his own flimsy accounts of the events.

202
00:10:58.790 --> 00:11:02.120
As far as shepherd was concerned, he stuck to his original story,

203
00:11:02.150 --> 00:11:06.830
placing the blame on a Bush. He had met the jury retaught on December the 17th.

204
00:11:06.860 --> 00:11:11.270
They deliberated for four days and returned a verdict of guilty of second degree

205
00:11:11.271 --> 00:11:14.780
murder. The judge then sentenced Sam Shepard to life in Brisbane. Meanwhile,

206
00:11:14.781 --> 00:11:17.780
the tragedies kept on coming for the shepherd family Sam's father,

207
00:11:17.781 --> 00:11:21.520
Dr. Richard Allen shepherd was slowly dying of stomach cancer. His mother,

208
00:11:21.530 --> 00:11:25.460
unable to cope with seeing her husband with her in front of her and her son sent

209
00:11:25.520 --> 00:11:28.910
to prison committed suicide on January the seventh, 1955,

210
00:11:29.060 --> 00:11:32.990
his father succumbed to his illness less than two weeks later at the very least

211
00:11:33.020 --> 00:11:36.470
Sam shepherd still had his lawyers fighting for him. His defense attorney,

212
00:11:36.471 --> 00:11:40.280
William Corrigan secured the services of an expert criminologist from California

213
00:11:40.281 --> 00:11:44.120
named Dr. Paul Kirk, who conducted another investigation of the crime scene.

214
00:11:44.450 --> 00:11:48.590
His final report concluded that the killer was left-handed unlike the doctor and

215
00:11:48.591 --> 00:11:51.230
displayed an extreme Patriot of the shepherds.

216
00:11:51.380 --> 00:11:55.180
He found the doctor's version of events to be that expressed his belief that

217
00:11:55.181 --> 00:11:59.170
there was blood in the bedroom that belongs to neither Sam or Marin and shepherd

218
00:11:59.350 --> 00:12:03.010
based on his report, Corrigan filed a motion for a new trial,

219
00:12:03.040 --> 00:12:06.070
but it was dismissed by the eighth district, a higher court of appeals.

220
00:12:06.340 --> 00:12:08.860
A decision later affirmed by the Ohio Supreme court.

221
00:12:14.760 --> 00:12:16.020
<v 2>[Inaudible] it seems.</v>

222
00:12:16.390 --> 00:12:17.880
<v 0>It was the end of the road for Sam Shepard.</v>

223
00:12:17.881 --> 00:12:21.030
As the doctor began serving his sentence in a maximum security prison,

224
00:12:21.090 --> 00:12:23.970
but as long as still believed that a short of winning an appeal,

225
00:12:24.000 --> 00:12:27.870
not based on new evidence, but on the prejudice shown against their clients.

226
00:12:27.900 --> 00:12:29.250
During the original trial,

227
00:12:29.310 --> 00:12:34.080
William Corrigan kept fighting for shepherds up until his own death in July,

228
00:12:34.080 --> 00:12:34.830
1961. Afterwards,

229
00:12:34.830 --> 00:12:38.250
his case was taken off the line up and coming at Sandy named F Lee Bailey for

230
00:12:38.251 --> 00:12:40.200
most other lawyers occasions like that,

231
00:12:40.201 --> 00:12:43.890
of Sam Shepard woods undoubtedly represent the highlight of their careers,

232
00:12:43.891 --> 00:12:45.960
but for Bailey, it was just the start.

233
00:12:46.020 --> 00:12:48.300
He would go on to be involved in other high-profile suits,

234
00:12:48.301 --> 00:12:50.970
including the patchy trial, the Boston strangler,

235
00:12:50.971 --> 00:12:54.960
and most famous of all the OJ Simpson case in 1963,

236
00:12:55.260 --> 00:12:58.770
Beatty filed a petition for writ of habeas Corpus in federal court.

237
00:12:58.890 --> 00:13:00.060
On behalf of his clients,

238
00:13:00.150 --> 00:13:04.740
arguing that all the bias publicity against jeopardy violated his right to due

239
00:13:04.741 --> 00:13:08.370
process. Of course, Shepherd's lawyers had already been saying this for years,

240
00:13:08.371 --> 00:13:12.210
but this time Bailey had some new evidence which tainted the presumed

241
00:13:12.240 --> 00:13:15.210
objectivity of the trial. Judge Edward bison,

242
00:13:15.330 --> 00:13:18.930
this involved testimony from people at the courthouse to whom Blethin expressed

243
00:13:18.931 --> 00:13:22.380
his belief, that shepherd was already guilty during the trial law,

244
00:13:22.530 --> 00:13:26.130
before it even started. Most notable of all was crime journalist.

245
00:13:26.131 --> 00:13:30.450
Dorothy Kilgallen who mentioned that judge [inaudible] once called her into his

246
00:13:30.451 --> 00:13:33.480
chambers. And during that conversation regarding shepherd,

247
00:13:33.660 --> 00:13:35.970
the judge said it's an open and shut case.

248
00:13:36.210 --> 00:13:40.320
He's guilty as hell Bailey's petition was accepted in July,

249
00:13:40.320 --> 00:13:44.250
1964 by a federal district court judge Wineman who dismissed the original trial

250
00:13:44.251 --> 00:13:48.420
as a mockery of justice offered almost 10 years in prison. Sam Schatt.

251
00:13:48.421 --> 00:13:49.470
That was a free man.

252
00:13:49.700 --> 00:13:53.430
Once more freedom could have easily been snatched away from him. Again,

253
00:13:53.580 --> 00:13:57.300
habeas Corpus meant that his imprisonments had been ruled to be unlawful.

254
00:13:57.480 --> 00:14:00.930
It did not declare him innocent of his crime and the prosecution had plenty of

255
00:14:00.931 --> 00:14:03.570
time to file a new charges. But even before that,

256
00:14:03.571 --> 00:14:07.890
so they launched an appeal on Wineman's decision, which was approved in 1965,

257
00:14:07.891 --> 00:14:09.810
by the sixth circuit court of appeals,

258
00:14:09.811 --> 00:14:12.060
thus reversing the ruling of the federal judge.

259
00:14:12.300 --> 00:14:14.700
It looks like shepherds would be happy back to prison,

260
00:14:14.790 --> 00:14:17.520
but then Bailey filed his own appeal.

261
00:14:17.580 --> 00:14:21.780
Basically it was a game of one-upmanship until inevitably the case reached the

262
00:14:21.781 --> 00:14:25.050
highest court in the land. The United States Supreme court,

263
00:14:25.110 --> 00:14:28.680
the case of shepherd and Maxwell started in February, 1966.

264
00:14:28.860 --> 00:14:32.580
It ended on June the sixth with a vote of eight to one in the doctor's favor,

265
00:14:32.640 --> 00:14:34.320
the Supreme court under chief justice,

266
00:14:34.350 --> 00:14:37.500
Earl Warren found that the trial judge had failed to protect shepherd

267
00:14:37.501 --> 00:14:41.700
sufficiently from the massive pervasive and prejudicial publicity that

268
00:14:42.000 --> 00:14:43.680
attended his prosecution.

269
00:14:43.770 --> 00:14:48.600
And that the doctor did not receive a fair trial consistent with the due process

270
00:14:48.601 --> 00:14:52.120
clause of the 14th amendments. This was all good news for shampoo,

271
00:14:52.400 --> 00:14:55.580
but once again, this simply invalidated the previous trial.

272
00:14:55.581 --> 00:14:59.750
It did not exonerate him of the murder. The prosecution filed new challenges.

273
00:14:59.751 --> 00:15:03.350
And another trial started in November of that same year. This one, however,

274
00:15:03.920 --> 00:15:04.940
went a little differently.

275
00:15:05.000 --> 00:15:08.690
Bailey was far more aggressive during cross-examination and was able to

276
00:15:08.691 --> 00:15:12.290
discredit some of the previous testimonies for not being objectively

277
00:15:12.320 --> 00:15:14.870
incriminating against his clients. It's only,

278
00:15:14.871 --> 00:15:18.380
it was also able to introduce as evidence, the report from criminologist, Paul,

279
00:15:18.830 --> 00:15:22.970
who expressed his belief that a left-handed third person has been in the

280
00:15:23.300 --> 00:15:25.190
shepherd bedroom on the night of the murder.

281
00:15:25.400 --> 00:15:28.100
And he also avoided putting Sam Shepard on the stand,

282
00:15:28.250 --> 00:15:32.300
knowing that the doctor's a vague story about the bushy had attacker was not

283
00:15:32.301 --> 00:15:33.500
particularly believable.

284
00:15:33.650 --> 00:15:36.590
All of Bailey's hard work paid off and on November the 16th,

285
00:15:36.740 --> 00:15:40.580
the jury found Sam shepherd not guilty of the murder of Meredith.

286
00:15:41.140 --> 00:15:41.973
<v 2>Shattered.</v>

287
00:15:47.440 --> 00:15:48.273
Finally.

288
00:15:48.310 --> 00:15:49.180
<v 0>Over 12 years,</v>

289
00:15:49.181 --> 00:15:52.660
Sam Shepard had been officially exonerated of killing his wife now free.

290
00:15:52.661 --> 00:15:54.940
He tried to get his life back on track bond in prison.

291
00:15:55.000 --> 00:15:59.200
He had started communicating with a German divorcee named Arianne Tabin Johan's

292
00:15:59.201 --> 00:16:02.830
and the two got married very soon after his release in 1964.

293
00:16:02.920 --> 00:16:05.170
This was before his second trial and even started.

294
00:16:05.440 --> 00:16:08.860
The marriage did not last very long. However, ending in divorce in 1968,

295
00:16:09.220 --> 00:16:12.820
Tevin Johns claims that shepherd drank a lot and that on occasion he had

296
00:16:12.821 --> 00:16:14.320
threatened her physically, indeed.

297
00:16:14.321 --> 00:16:17.200
Things did not go smoothly for the doctor after his release from prison.

298
00:16:17.440 --> 00:16:19.210
He wanted to stop practicing medicine again,

299
00:16:19.211 --> 00:16:23.020
but he soon discovered that being incarcerated for 10 years had a significant

300
00:16:23.021 --> 00:16:24.130
impact on his skills.

301
00:16:24.340 --> 00:16:27.670
He obtained a position with the Youngstown osteopathic hospital in Youngstown,

302
00:16:27.671 --> 00:16:32.620
Ohio, but was forced to resign in 1968 after making mistakes during surgery.

303
00:16:32.980 --> 00:16:35.020
The cause the deaths of two of his patients,

304
00:16:35.230 --> 00:16:37.720
both here in the hospital faced wrongful death suits,

305
00:16:37.750 --> 00:16:39.850
which made it hard for him to find a position elsewhere.

306
00:16:39.940 --> 00:16:42.910
Following his divorce and his resignation shepherd was struggling with

307
00:16:42.911 --> 00:16:46.000
alcoholism and depression. He moved to a suburb of Columbus.

308
00:16:46.300 --> 00:16:49.210
Gord Gahanna were intended to open a small medical office,

309
00:16:49.211 --> 00:16:51.700
but fate had a different career in mind for him.

310
00:16:52.330 --> 00:16:56.980
Professional wrestling was serious in Gahanna shepherd made the acquaintance of

311
00:16:56.981 --> 00:16:59.800
a man named George Strickland. He was a pro wrestler.

312
00:16:59.860 --> 00:17:01.780
He convinced the doctor that his notoriety,

313
00:17:01.840 --> 00:17:05.020
you could make the hits in wrestling, especially if he played a villain.

314
00:17:05.080 --> 00:17:07.720
Therefore in August, 1969, at the age of 45,

315
00:17:07.900 --> 00:17:11.920
the doctor who had once been accused of murdering his wife had his first pro

316
00:17:11.921 --> 00:17:16.210
wrestling match. Strickland usually acted as his manager or tag partner runs.

317
00:17:16.390 --> 00:17:19.060
He even became Shepherd's father-in-law in real life.

318
00:17:19.090 --> 00:17:23.050
After the doctor married his 20 year old daughter, Colleen Strickland's,

319
00:17:23.170 --> 00:17:27.250
unfortunately Dr. Shepherd's career inside the squad circle lasted less than a

320
00:17:27.251 --> 00:17:30.550
year. His heavy drinking took a toll on his health and on April the sixth,

321
00:17:30.551 --> 00:17:33.880
1970 Sam Shepard died aged 46.

322
00:17:34.030 --> 00:17:36.240
Initially the cause of death was thought to be liver failure,

323
00:17:36.280 --> 00:17:40.030
but it was later determined to be a type of brain damage gold when Nikki and

324
00:17:40.300 --> 00:17:42.850
Kappa Lafayette also a result of his alcoholism.

325
00:17:49.380 --> 00:17:50.220
<v 2>Since Dr. Sam.</v>

326
00:17:50.610 --> 00:17:52.770
<v 0>Shepard was found not guilty in a second trial,</v>

327
00:17:52.800 --> 00:17:56.880
this is not the question of well who kills Marilyn Shepherd after his death,

328
00:17:56.910 --> 00:17:57.510
it was his son,

329
00:17:57.510 --> 00:18:00.570
Samuel who continued the fight for justice for both of his parents,

330
00:18:00.571 --> 00:18:05.130
finding his mother's killer and clearing his father's name during the mid 1990s,

331
00:18:05.131 --> 00:18:08.730
Samuel filed suit for wrongful imprisonments against the County.

332
00:18:08.731 --> 00:18:09.900
On behalf of his father.

333
00:18:09.960 --> 00:18:14.220
This led to the exhumation of both shepherds to collect samples for modern DNA

334
00:18:14.221 --> 00:18:17.520
tests, one report, which was used by his lawyer during the trial,

335
00:18:17.610 --> 00:18:21.600
seemingly excluded Sam shepherd as the source of the blood found at the crime

336
00:18:21.601 --> 00:18:23.610
scene. We might not have mentioned him so far,

337
00:18:23.640 --> 00:18:28.530
but the truth is that the long been a viable second suspect that Samuel Shepherd

338
00:18:28.531 --> 00:18:30.030
believed was the real killer.

339
00:18:30.150 --> 00:18:33.720
His name was Richard e-billing and he worked as an occasional handyman in the

340
00:18:33.721 --> 00:18:35.190
neighborhood where the shepherds lipped.

341
00:18:35.250 --> 00:18:38.670
He first came under suspicion in 1959 when he was arrested for Lawson,

342
00:18:39.120 --> 00:18:43.000
as it turns out, eviling stole various items from the houses where he worked,

343
00:18:43.440 --> 00:18:45.270
he had in his possession, some rings,

344
00:18:45.271 --> 00:18:48.300
which have belonged to Marilyn Shepherd while the handyman admissive to

345
00:18:48.301 --> 00:18:48.811
thievery.

346
00:18:48.811 --> 00:18:52.440
He claims that he stole the jewelry years after a death from the house of a

347
00:18:52.450 --> 00:18:54.300
brother-in-law during the original trial,

348
00:18:54.660 --> 00:18:58.380
Liebling was dismissed as a suspect after allegedly passing a polygraph test

349
00:18:58.381 --> 00:18:59.310
with flying colors.

350
00:18:59.340 --> 00:19:02.940
But the modern evaluation claims that the results have been misrepresented and

351
00:19:03.180 --> 00:19:05.820
that they had been inconclusive at best. The same thing,

352
00:19:06.270 --> 00:19:10.200
applied to modern DNA tests. They did not specifically implicate e-billing,

353
00:19:10.440 --> 00:19:12.180
but they also did not rule him out.

354
00:19:12.330 --> 00:19:16.050
And other uncertain aspect was the memorable traits provided by Sam Shepard

355
00:19:16.051 --> 00:19:18.510
regarding his attacker being bushy hat.

356
00:19:18.660 --> 00:19:22.500
Richard e-billing was balding at the time of the crime. He certainly was not,

357
00:19:22.530 --> 00:19:25.260
but she has, but it was also known to wear toupees.

358
00:19:25.290 --> 00:19:30.150
So this two did not conclusively condemn or acquit him decades

359
00:19:30.151 --> 00:19:33.390
later e-billing was sentenced to life in jail for the murder of a different

360
00:19:33.391 --> 00:19:36.210
woman named Sol made Durkin during his incarceration.

361
00:19:36.390 --> 00:19:39.660
Two people came forward claiming that the former handyman had confessed to them

362
00:19:39.661 --> 00:19:42.180
in private that he had murdered Marilyn Shepherd.

363
00:19:42.270 --> 00:19:44.780
One was a woman who used to look off to SMA duck and,

364
00:19:44.781 --> 00:19:48.270
and the other was a fellow inmate. Richard nibbling died in prison in 1998.

365
00:19:48.271 --> 00:19:50.520
So no charges were ever brought against him.

366
00:19:50.760 --> 00:19:54.960
Another even more recent suspect comes to us, courtesy of retired FBI agent,

367
00:19:55.050 --> 00:19:57.240
but at Connors who pointed the finger,

368
00:19:57.510 --> 00:20:01.230
it's a former air force major named James Corp. After his own wife died,

369
00:20:01.410 --> 00:20:04.230
call began committing robberies and Connors believed this.

370
00:20:04.410 --> 00:20:07.770
He burgled the Shepherd's home and attacked Marilyn. When she caught him.

371
00:20:08.400 --> 00:20:11.940
Red-handed ultimately the jury in Samuel Shepherd's wrongful imprisonment suit

372
00:20:11.950 --> 00:20:15.210
sided with the County. It seems that almost half a century later,

373
00:20:15.240 --> 00:20:18.300
many people were still not convinced of Sam Shepherd's innocence.

374
00:20:18.420 --> 00:20:21.600
And that still goes to this day. People write books, articles,

375
00:20:21.601 --> 00:20:24.390
some point the finger at Dr. Shepherd others at Bridget e-billing.

376
00:20:24.391 --> 00:20:28.560
And some believe the murderer may have been a third man at this point in time

377
00:20:28.770 --> 00:20:30.960
with almost everyone involved in the case debt,

378
00:20:31.320 --> 00:20:35.670
it's looking highly unlikely that we'll ever discover the whole truth.

379
00:20:35.850 --> 00:20:37.080
