00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:01.680
<v 0>Guys just before we get into today's video,</v>

2
00:00:01.720 --> 00:00:05.520
I do wanna give a quick plug to a very new channel that I'm working on.

3
00:00:05.550 --> 00:00:06.840
It's a business theme channel,

4
00:00:07.060 --> 00:00:11.720
and we cover topics like why the 50 pound note in the UK is pretty much just for

5
00:00:11.920 --> 00:00:12.460
criminals,

6
00:00:12.460 --> 00:00:16.800
why us public transport sucked so bad and things like that actually recently

7
00:00:16.801 --> 00:00:20.710
made a video on that channel about this guy who wanted to invent this sock that

8
00:00:20.711 --> 00:00:21.830
would prevent trench foot,

9
00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:25.830
that ended up making something completely different and kind useless.

10
00:00:26.010 --> 00:00:29.550
And I wanna play you a clip from that video, but before we do,

11
00:00:29.551 --> 00:00:32.070
I'll just say that it's quite different to my normal stuff.

12
00:00:32.071 --> 00:00:33.150
<v 1>Like the stuff on this channel.</v>

13
00:00:33.410 --> 00:00:36.990
And if you want me to just give you the facts really straight and you hate fun,

14
00:00:37.250 --> 00:00:38.510
you're not gonna like this new channel,

15
00:00:38.530 --> 00:00:41.860
but if you like facts and if you like fun, you'll probably like it.

16
00:00:41.860 --> 00:00:42.693
<v 0>Here's a quick clip.</v>

17
00:00:42.760 --> 00:00:45.500
Can you imagine like working for like the department of defense or whatever,

18
00:00:45.620 --> 00:00:47.540
and it's like, we've got this huge medical problem.

19
00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:52.140
People's feet are rotting off in the trenches and it's like, what's his face?

20
00:00:52.660 --> 00:00:54.260
Edgar's like, yeah, yeah, I'll fix that.

21
00:00:54.400 --> 00:00:55.500
I'm gonna go and meant something for that.

22
00:00:55.960 --> 00:00:58.460
He comes about like a month later and he is like, gentlemen,

23
00:00:58.700 --> 00:00:59.740
I present to you the water bomb.

24
00:01:00.240 --> 00:01:03.450
He had utterly failed in his find a prevention for trench foot,

25
00:01:03.630 --> 00:01:06.970
but he immediately became inspired to invent water balloon toys for children,

26
00:01:07.340 --> 00:01:09.050
which sounds like loads, more fun.

27
00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:12.290
I'm sure he is into all the people in the trenches who are like my face,

28
00:01:13.270 --> 00:01:17.370
but on my feet, Edgar. So if you like that, please do click below,

29
00:01:17.550 --> 00:01:21.690
go subscribe three times a week on that channel. And let's get into the video.

30
00:01:23.080 --> 00:01:25.840
Smith of vampire is as old as time itself.

31
00:01:25.900 --> 00:01:30.600
And many incarnations of this demonic creature are found in almost every

32
00:01:30.601 --> 00:01:33.200
culture. And when we think about vampires today,

33
00:01:33.260 --> 00:01:37.760
one novel cast sits shadow over legions of imitators,

34
00:01:38.350 --> 00:01:42.320
Dracula, the unde one, man, a former civil servant theater manager,

35
00:01:42.790 --> 00:01:46.030
and part-time writer condensed into one single worker fiction,

36
00:01:46.830 --> 00:01:51.390
all VAM Peric law. As we know it today, this is the story of bra Stoker.

37
00:01:51.391 --> 00:01:56.190
What came before and after Dracula Rand's water relationship in particular may

38
00:01:56.191 --> 00:02:00.070
have given him the inspiration he needed to resurrect the vampire.

39
00:02:12.610 --> 00:02:15.380
Abraham bra Stoker was born in Clint,

40
00:02:15.540 --> 00:02:18.780
a near Dublin islands on November the eighth, 1847.

41
00:02:19.080 --> 00:02:22.460
He was the third out of seven children in a Protestant family. At that time,

42
00:02:22.620 --> 00:02:26.970
Irelands was of course still part of the United Kingdom and both his father and

43
00:02:26.971 --> 00:02:31.290
his eldest brother served as loyal civil servants to the crown bra was a sickly

44
00:02:31.291 --> 00:02:35.530
child and spent most of his time housebound or bedridden until the age of seven.

45
00:02:35.750 --> 00:02:39.610
His youthful imagination was influenced by real life tales of death disease

46
00:02:39.710 --> 00:02:40.190
misery.

47
00:02:40.190 --> 00:02:44.280
He was born during the terrible potato famine as though his relatively healthy

48
00:02:44.300 --> 00:02:45.960
family did not suffer directly.

49
00:02:46.110 --> 00:02:48.840
They undoubtedly would've felt its societal effect.

50
00:02:49.280 --> 00:02:53.280
Bra also spent much time listening to the stories told by his mother Charlottes

51
00:02:53.281 --> 00:02:55.400
about the color epidemic of 1832,

52
00:02:55.490 --> 00:02:59.640
which claimed thousands of lives rather eventually overcame his poor health and

53
00:02:59.641 --> 00:03:04.360
grew up to be a tall athletic youth crowned by a head of bright red hair after

54
00:03:04.361 --> 00:03:07.440
secondary school bra enrolled at Trinity college in Dublin,

55
00:03:07.441 --> 00:03:10.480
where he made a reputation as both an excellent student and an athlete.

56
00:03:10.780 --> 00:03:14.840
He won prizes in several track and field disciplines and was also a keen row and

57
00:03:14.841 --> 00:03:16.520
rugby player. Despite his size.

58
00:03:16.521 --> 00:03:21.430
He developed a notable agility perform on the rings and the trape in 1870.

59
00:03:21.530 --> 00:03:23.870
He graduated with honors in science and mathematics,

60
00:03:24.010 --> 00:03:27.910
but he also studied a Retary and history. After graduating,

61
00:03:27.911 --> 00:03:32.470
he entered the Irish civil service where he served for 10 years as inspector of

62
00:03:32.471 --> 00:03:33.350
the petty sessions,

63
00:03:33.530 --> 00:03:37.670
the petty sessions were 600 magistrates court scattered all over Ireland,

64
00:03:37.671 --> 00:03:40.100
dealing with minor pen Norland civil cases.

65
00:03:40.460 --> 00:03:45.140
Stoker's task was to oversee that they functioned correctly. Yay, mammoth task.

66
00:03:45.290 --> 00:03:47.260
Certainly despite the heavy workload,

67
00:03:47.261 --> 00:03:51.140
the young civil servants found the time to vent his passion for writing and

68
00:03:51.210 --> 00:03:55.860
succeeded in publishing some short stories in 1870, such as the crystal carbon,

69
00:03:56.100 --> 00:03:58.260
1872 and his first horror tale,

70
00:03:58.400 --> 00:04:02.170
the chain of death in 1875 during the same year,

71
00:04:02.690 --> 00:04:04.170
Stoker also penned his first novel,

72
00:04:04.470 --> 00:04:07.610
the Primrose path serialized in the magazine. The Shamrock,

73
00:04:07.790 --> 00:04:11.610
the work is a melodrama about an honest carpenter from Dublin who moves to

74
00:04:11.611 --> 00:04:13.250
London to work at a rundown theater.

75
00:04:13.460 --> 00:04:16.170
There are no horror or supernatural elements here.

76
00:04:16.200 --> 00:04:21.080
Just a vivid description of how a good man can be brought down by the evils of

77
00:04:21.081 --> 00:04:25.200
alcohol. Stoker's writing extended into nonfiction. By the end of the decade,

78
00:04:25.450 --> 00:04:27.680
after years of managing the petty sessions,

79
00:04:28.040 --> 00:04:32.160
brown felt the need to write a sort of manual for the court clerks. So in 1879,

80
00:04:32.161 --> 00:04:35.600
he published the duties of clerks of petty sessions in Ireland.

81
00:04:35.870 --> 00:04:39.240
This book may sound dull to those who are not passionate about law,

82
00:04:39.241 --> 00:04:43.750
but there is an interest thing section about the treatment of dangerous LUN in

83
00:04:43.760 --> 00:04:47.990
court, maybe an early inspiration for some of DRS characters, perhaps,

84
00:04:47.991 --> 00:04:52.150
maybe Renfield and Dr. Seaward during his decade in the civil service,

85
00:04:52.250 --> 00:04:56.750
the energetic bra also indulged in a love for drama and theater inherited from

86
00:04:56.751 --> 00:04:57.490
his parents.

87
00:04:57.490 --> 00:05:00.630
His knowledge of the stage was sufficient and enough that he landed a side gig

88
00:05:00.631 --> 00:05:05.020
as a to critic for the Dublin male, his writing extended to other genres.

89
00:05:05.021 --> 00:05:08.380
And he published an article defending Walter Whitman's collection of poems

90
00:05:08.400 --> 00:05:09.260
leaves of grass,

91
00:05:09.261 --> 00:05:13.020
which was considered controversial at the time brown Woodley meet and befriend

92
00:05:13.021 --> 00:05:16.500
Whitman. One of many literary Jans to form a bond with stoke app,

93
00:05:16.740 --> 00:05:18.980
their friendship. It started with a controversial letter,

94
00:05:19.280 --> 00:05:22.770
but more on that bit later in 1876,

95
00:05:23.090 --> 00:05:26.450
bra Stoker met for the first time, the famous actor, Henry Irving,

96
00:05:26.630 --> 00:05:30.210
the actor had read some of Stoker's favorable reviews of him and wanted to meet

97
00:05:30.211 --> 00:05:32.170
the critic. The two became close friends,

98
00:05:32.171 --> 00:05:35.250
starting a relationship that would change Stoker's life.

99
00:05:35.470 --> 00:05:38.970
Now we don't know if any of Brown's romantic relationships until this point,

100
00:05:39.110 --> 00:05:41.090
but he would soon catch up.

101
00:05:41.690 --> 00:05:45.520
Bra became entangled in a love triangle with a girl called Florence Balcom,

102
00:05:45.820 --> 00:05:47.760
the third vertex of the triangle. Well,

103
00:05:47.761 --> 00:05:52.160
that was none other than fellow Irish author, Oscar wild in 1878,

104
00:05:52.161 --> 00:05:53.320
Florence made up her mind.

105
00:05:53.460 --> 00:05:57.200
She chose bra over Oscar and as the two married on the 4th of December,

106
00:05:57.420 --> 00:06:01.320
but Stoker and wild they've actually remained good friends with brand being a

107
00:06:01.321 --> 00:06:02.760
regular in Oscar's literary circle.

108
00:06:03.060 --> 00:06:04.840
Now we may be looking too hard for clues here,

109
00:06:04.841 --> 00:06:09.800
but isn't there a similar situation in Dr. When Nina's friend Lucy is courted

110
00:06:09.820 --> 00:06:14.040
by Dr. Seawood Quincy Morris and Lord Homewood with the three remaining good

111
00:06:14.041 --> 00:06:15.640
friends, despite their romantic rivalry.

112
00:06:15.850 --> 00:06:19.830
While that same Henry eing invited Stoker to London with a job offer becoming

113
00:06:19.890 --> 00:06:21.870
his manager, Braley accepted,

114
00:06:21.871 --> 00:06:25.390
running the affairs of both Irving and his theater. The, I see him,

115
00:06:25.630 --> 00:06:28.910
their working relationship. It continued until Irving's death in 1905.

116
00:06:29.130 --> 00:06:32.350
For the moment though, let's stick to the stokers in 1879,

117
00:06:32.351 --> 00:06:36.550
they welcomed their only child Irving null named after his godfather,

118
00:06:36.600 --> 00:06:40.620
Henry Irving. The boy's birth must have inspired. Stoker is three years later.

119
00:06:40.680 --> 00:06:44.820
He published under the sunset, a collection of tales for children in 1890,

120
00:06:44.840 --> 00:06:48.340
Stoker published his second full length novel entitled the snakes pass.

121
00:06:48.610 --> 00:06:52.100
This is the only of Stokes works to be set in his native islands.

122
00:06:52.101 --> 00:06:55.780
And one can see the shadow of supernatural elements beginning to creep in,

123
00:06:55.781 --> 00:06:59.250
as we follow a young English and his quest for a treasure,

124
00:06:59.730 --> 00:07:03.490
supposedly hidden by St. Patrick after his battle with the king of snakes,

125
00:07:03.630 --> 00:07:05.610
the novel also delivers subtle hints,

126
00:07:05.611 --> 00:07:07.930
rebuke king English intrusion in Irish society.

127
00:07:08.080 --> 00:07:12.210
Even as a former loyal civil servant Stoker did not hide his support for Irish

128
00:07:12.360 --> 00:07:15.210
home rule, then eventual independence from the United Kingdom.

129
00:07:15.630 --> 00:07:17.690
It was only after the snakes pass was published.

130
00:07:17.890 --> 00:07:21.840
The am Stoker began working on his imortal masterpiece Dracula.

131
00:07:21.990 --> 00:07:25.680
I've already hinted at a couple of possible real life inspirations for the

132
00:07:25.681 --> 00:07:26.100
novel,

133
00:07:26.100 --> 00:07:30.160
but it's time now to look at the man who may have possibly inspired the count

134
00:07:30.161 --> 00:07:33.800
himself Stoker's employer and friend Henry Irving

135
00:07:40.210 --> 00:07:42.830
Stoker first met Henry Irving in 1876,

136
00:07:42.831 --> 00:07:46.390
but his first written review of the Sian dates back to 1871,

137
00:07:46.560 --> 00:07:48.190
after seeing him perform in the play,

138
00:07:48.191 --> 00:07:51.830
the two roses Stoker wrote a sharp critique of the performance that he would

139
00:07:51.831 --> 00:07:56.750
eventually deny penning and later writings by 76 Ivin was Britain's top actor

140
00:07:56.751 --> 00:07:59.340
working as the leading star of English drama.

141
00:07:59.470 --> 00:08:01.820
After a performance of Hamlet in Dublin,

142
00:08:02.340 --> 00:08:06.100
Irving was flattered by Stoker's review and invited him to supp bra and Henry

143
00:08:06.130 --> 00:08:09.260
clicked immediately and made plans to dine together again.

144
00:08:09.440 --> 00:08:12.980
During the second dinner, Irving performed his piece to resist sauce.

145
00:08:13.000 --> 00:08:14.100
Thomas Hood's poem,

146
00:08:14.470 --> 00:08:19.140
dream of Eugene a the delivery was so electrifying that bra apparently

147
00:08:20.090 --> 00:08:24.690
bloated into violent hysterics. The writer was now enthralled by the performer.

148
00:08:25.050 --> 00:08:27.810
Brown later wrote then began the close friendship between us,

149
00:08:27.811 --> 00:08:32.770
which only terminated with his life if indeed friendship like any other form

150
00:08:32.771 --> 00:08:36.570
of love can of a terminate from that hour began a friendship as profound,

151
00:08:36.910 --> 00:08:40.480
as close as lasting as can be between two men,

152
00:08:41.080 --> 00:08:45.160
their professional relationship though, that started two years later in 1878,

153
00:08:45.161 --> 00:08:49.800
when Irving took ownership of the li theater in London and invited Stok to join

154
00:08:49.801 --> 00:08:50.020
him,

155
00:08:50.020 --> 00:08:54.400
he would manage both the theater and Henry's career on the 14th of December 10

156
00:08:54.401 --> 00:08:57.680
days after marrying Florence, Bram eagerly accepted the invitation,

157
00:08:58.120 --> 00:09:01.120
and he moved to London. This move suited both new, new ADSS.

158
00:09:01.190 --> 00:09:04.440
Bram was eager to establish fruitful connections for his literary career.

159
00:09:04.530 --> 00:09:08.480
While Florence was looking forward to leaving a mark on London's social scene,

160
00:09:08.750 --> 00:09:12.800
Bram threw himself with such energy and dedication into the new managerial work.

161
00:09:12.801 --> 00:09:16.830
That it's a wonder that he could do some creative writing on the site. In fact,

162
00:09:16.831 --> 00:09:19.630
he spent most of his time writing letters on Irving's behalf,

163
00:09:19.631 --> 00:09:20.910
even up to 60 a day,

164
00:09:21.020 --> 00:09:25.830
sorting out the daily admin tasks required by the theater or less often acting

165
00:09:26.090 --> 00:09:31.030
as tour manager for having himself so's passion and skills did not go

166
00:09:31.190 --> 00:09:32.910
unnoticed. Even newspapers of the time,

167
00:09:32.911 --> 00:09:37.860
usually more focused on the star act rather than their own Sage celebrated Bram.

168
00:09:38.080 --> 00:09:43.020
The Chicago daily news in 1888 wrote Mr. A's great success in this country has

169
00:09:43.021 --> 00:09:47.380
been due to a very considerable extent to the Shrew management of bra Stoker.

170
00:09:47.560 --> 00:09:50.860
We know of no manager, more vigilance, more indefatigable,

171
00:09:50.970 --> 00:09:55.340
more audacious than he having is fortunate in having so able

172
00:09:55.910 --> 00:10:00.890
and so loyal and associate while the English newspaper Northern E wondered what

173
00:10:01.020 --> 00:10:05.730
Henry would do without this Trojan, whose ubiquity is astounding.

174
00:10:05.990 --> 00:10:08.370
But what about the other side of this relationship?

175
00:10:08.590 --> 00:10:11.930
Did Irving appreciate Brams friendship and hard work?

176
00:10:12.150 --> 00:10:15.890
We know that two months before Bram had started working for having the act

177
00:10:16.240 --> 00:10:20.880
Stewart sent a letter signed with love in great haste Henry the following week,

178
00:10:21.120 --> 00:10:25.520
I haven't signed again with love, but by August, 1879,

179
00:10:25.521 --> 00:10:27.960
eight months after Irving had hired Stoker,

180
00:10:28.060 --> 00:10:32.640
his letters were signed plainly with your sincerely, this downgrade,

181
00:10:32.800 --> 00:10:37.150
maybe a reflection of more formal relations between the two now regulated by a

182
00:10:37.151 --> 00:10:41.430
boss employee dynamic. But it's sad to note that even in the workplace,

183
00:10:41.431 --> 00:10:45.230
having seemed to have little consideration for Stoker while newspapers

184
00:10:45.231 --> 00:10:48.430
attributed much of the actor success to Stoks management,

185
00:10:48.570 --> 00:10:52.030
the ICM theater programs with list bra only on page four,

186
00:10:52.140 --> 00:10:56.310
well below other employees, such as the stage manager and musical director.

187
00:10:56.500 --> 00:11:00.500
This lack of appreciation have been in line with Irving's personality as

188
00:11:00.501 --> 00:11:04.020
described by stoke as biographer Barbara Beford by all accounts,

189
00:11:04.021 --> 00:11:08.180
Henry Aing had a charming even mesmerizing personality. Most of all,

190
00:11:08.181 --> 00:11:11.940
he had a huge ego. This not only made he made demanding employer,

191
00:11:12.000 --> 00:11:15.940
but someone who in general depleted the positive energy of those around him

192
00:11:16.110 --> 00:11:19.610
today, we would describe him as having a toxic personality,

193
00:11:20.090 --> 00:11:24.170
probably with a narcissistic personality disorder thrown in as well.

194
00:11:24.470 --> 00:11:28.770
And yet brown never said or wrote anything negative about Irving in his later

195
00:11:28.920 --> 00:11:31.730
reminiscences. He even praised at great length,

196
00:11:31.790 --> 00:11:35.530
the mind and the body of the actor, writing that up to the age of 60,

197
00:11:35.531 --> 00:11:37.970
he was compact of steel and whip core.

198
00:11:38.300 --> 00:11:42.240
His energy and nervous power were such as only came from a great brain.

199
00:11:42.460 --> 00:11:46.800
And the muscular force of that lean live body must have been

200
00:11:47.110 --> 00:11:49.200
extraordinary. Excellent SAS.

201
00:11:49.201 --> 00:11:53.680
This one have led to speculation on whether Bram Stoker was a closeted gay man

202
00:11:53.740 --> 00:11:55.640
in the marriage of convenience with Florence,

203
00:11:55.660 --> 00:11:59.640
but actually rather in love with his actor friend and employer,

204
00:11:59.780 --> 00:12:03.880
the questions will remain unanswered as there is no certain proof of Stoker's

205
00:12:03.881 --> 00:12:06.800
true sexual preferences. However, prior to the Irving years,

206
00:12:06.980 --> 00:12:11.040
one particular piece of writing could be seen as proof of Stoker's homosexuality

207
00:12:11.220 --> 00:12:13.750
or bisexuality on Valentine's day,

208
00:12:13.990 --> 00:12:16.590
1876 Bram wrote a letter to American poet,

209
00:12:16.780 --> 00:12:20.990
Walt Whitman himself rued to be a homosexual law bisexual man

210
00:12:21.310 --> 00:12:24.830
Stoker's letter was to express his ecstatic admiration at the collection of

211
00:12:25.000 --> 00:12:26.270
poems leaves of grass.

212
00:12:26.650 --> 00:12:30.270
The last paragraph reads as such how sweeter thing it is for a strong,

213
00:12:30.271 --> 00:12:34.420
healthy man with a woman's eye and a child's wish is do you feel that he can

214
00:12:34.421 --> 00:12:36.380
speak to a man who can be,

215
00:12:36.480 --> 00:12:40.100
if he wishes father and brother and wife to his soul?

216
00:12:40.460 --> 00:12:44.740
I don't think you will laugh. Walt Witchman nor despise me, but at all events,

217
00:12:44.900 --> 00:12:49.660
I thank you for all the love and sympathy you have given me in common with my

218
00:12:49.661 --> 00:12:53.690
kind, the phrase, a woman's eye may be a clue, but again, &lt;affirmative&gt;,

219
00:12:53.691 --> 00:12:57.610
there is not concrete evidence. If soca was a closeted homosexual,

220
00:12:57.611 --> 00:13:01.690
this would only add to his anxiety and sense of inadequacy.

221
00:13:01.820 --> 00:13:05.690
Let's not forget that homosexuality was still considered a crime in Victorian

222
00:13:05.691 --> 00:13:06.970
Britain. These feelings,

223
00:13:07.030 --> 00:13:11.330
at least according to one critic may have also crept up and Bran's most famous

224
00:13:11.340 --> 00:13:12.150
novel.

225
00:13:12.150 --> 00:13:16.360
So let's take a look at how Dracula aim to be and how it can be interpreted

226
00:13:22.980 --> 00:13:26.560
By the early 1890s. Brown was still working at the ly theater.

227
00:13:26.740 --> 00:13:30.400
His financial position should have been stable. In theory, in practice,

228
00:13:30.580 --> 00:13:34.080
we know that it lost much of his savings in two failed investments.

229
00:13:34.220 --> 00:13:38.030
One them promoted by American novelist, mark Twain. In those same years,

230
00:13:38.050 --> 00:13:41.870
he had started working on a novel that would sort out his financial ways,

231
00:13:42.010 --> 00:13:45.750
but more importantly, make him an imortal author Dracula,

232
00:13:45.751 --> 00:13:50.390
which was first published by archable Constable in 1897 is so well known that I

233
00:13:50.550 --> 00:13:53.910
probably don't need to recap the story for you. If you haven't read it yet,

234
00:13:53.911 --> 00:13:57.180
it's available for three and we're gonna link to that below.

235
00:13:57.680 --> 00:14:02.260
So what inspired the character's plot and themes of Dracula on literary level?

236
00:14:02.440 --> 00:14:06.140
The 19th century had already offered some examples of vampire fiction,

237
00:14:06.780 --> 00:14:11.300
18 nineteens the vampire by John Paul Dory first introduces the trope of the

238
00:14:11.301 --> 00:14:16.250
vampire is a mysterious and charming Aris Tora with a mesmerizing whose

239
00:14:16.251 --> 00:14:19.530
victims find him difficult to resist on a more graphic level.

240
00:14:19.530 --> 00:14:22.050
It was the 1845 Gothic serial Vanny.

241
00:14:22.051 --> 00:14:26.450
The vampire that popularized the idea of vampires having fangs and leaving bite

242
00:14:26.500 --> 00:14:29.890
marks on their victims. Necks finally, car Miller by fellow Irish,

243
00:14:30.250 --> 00:14:31.083
author Sheridan,

244
00:14:31.410 --> 00:14:35.930
Lafa attributed to vampires the power to metamor into animals and popularized

245
00:14:36.080 --> 00:14:40.720
concept of a vampire expert who knows the secrets to slay the unde

246
00:14:41.160 --> 00:14:41.560
more subtle.

247
00:14:41.560 --> 00:14:46.200
I Lafa introduced the concept of VAM as a metaphor for seduction or even

248
00:14:46.310 --> 00:14:50.080
just for intercourse. One of many interpretations of Dr. Envisions,

249
00:14:50.081 --> 00:14:53.600
this character is a sexual predator who fixate on female victims,

250
00:14:54.140 --> 00:14:57.760
Stoker combined all these elements with other aspects of vampire law,

251
00:14:57.761 --> 00:15:02.400
establishing the definitive collection of vampire cliches perpetuated by horror

252
00:15:02.401 --> 00:15:06.040
literature, the aversion to garlic, crucifixes mirrors and roses,

253
00:15:06.041 --> 00:15:10.320
vulnerability to sunlight and wooden sticks, power over wolves, bats,

254
00:15:10.700 --> 00:15:14.470
even storms that need to rest in a coffin filled with a dirt from the

255
00:15:14.471 --> 00:15:17.670
motherland. Everything that we know about vampires today,

256
00:15:18.090 --> 00:15:21.070
we owed a Dracula besides preexisting vampire fiction,

257
00:15:21.290 --> 00:15:23.590
Stoker acknowledged other sources of inspiration.

258
00:15:23.690 --> 00:15:27.310
The assay Tavian superstitions by Emily ARDS.

259
00:15:27.370 --> 00:15:32.300
The book of Wells by Reverend Sabine baring jar's book in

260
00:15:32.301 --> 00:15:36.780
particular may have inspired Stoker to settle on trave as the home of the Ko.

261
00:15:36.970 --> 00:15:37.590
Finally,

262
00:15:37.590 --> 00:15:41.780
Irish folklore may have played a part in stirring Stoker's tastes towards the

263
00:15:41.781 --> 00:15:43.620
supernatural ran himself reported.

264
00:15:43.621 --> 00:15:47.860
Growing up on traditional tales told by his mother of Banies changelings

265
00:15:48.060 --> 00:15:48.861
malicious pixes,

266
00:15:48.861 --> 00:15:52.450
and shapeshifters who trick humans into giving them their souls.

267
00:15:52.790 --> 00:15:55.530
In addition to literary predecessors, Stoker, conjured,

268
00:15:55.531 --> 00:15:58.170
plot points and character features from real life.

269
00:15:58.190 --> 00:16:01.730
And I've already mentioned a couple of events which may have ended up in his

270
00:16:01.731 --> 00:16:03.730
masterpiece as for the protagonist.

271
00:16:03.731 --> 00:16:08.730
It is certain that VLA tope DRAL the military leader was a key influence on

272
00:16:08.731 --> 00:16:11.450
the sang nature of Dracula. The vampire.

273
00:16:11.520 --> 00:16:15.480
This is a even acknowledged in the novel when Dracula mentions his wars against

274
00:16:15.500 --> 00:16:18.440
the Ottoman invaders and the betrayal of his brother Rady,

275
00:16:18.620 --> 00:16:22.760
but a big stamp on Dracula's appearance and personality almost certainly came

276
00:16:22.870 --> 00:16:27.680
from Henry Irving. What did Henry look like? Well, here is brand's description.

277
00:16:27.980 --> 00:16:29.280
His face was a strong,

278
00:16:29.480 --> 00:16:34.430
a very strong Aqualine with high bridge of the in nose and peculiarly arch

279
00:16:34.670 --> 00:16:36.630
nostrils with lofty domed,

280
00:16:36.870 --> 00:16:41.310
forehead and hair growing scantly around the temples, but profusely elsewhere,

281
00:16:41.570 --> 00:16:46.390
his eyebrows were very massive almost meeting over the nose and with bushy hair

282
00:16:46.391 --> 00:16:51.310
that seemed to curl in its own perfusion matches the portrait. Right?

283
00:16:51.500 --> 00:16:52.990
Well, I must confess. I just tricked you.

284
00:16:53.060 --> 00:16:57.540
What I read is a description of Dracula straight from the novel Barbara Beford

285
00:16:57.630 --> 00:17:00.860
again, supports the idea that Irving is count Dr.

286
00:17:01.210 --> 00:17:02.660
Somewhere in the creative process.

287
00:17:02.810 --> 00:17:07.580
Dracula became a sinister caricature of Irving as a mesmerist and depleter

288
00:17:07.820 --> 00:17:11.980
an artist draining those about him to feed his ego. It was a stunning,

289
00:17:12.360 --> 00:17:13.340
but avenging tribute

290
00:17:19.850 --> 00:17:22.570
Stoker's novel is a Keystone of the horror genre.

291
00:17:22.710 --> 00:17:25.730
Not only because of its subject matter, but also because of its style.

292
00:17:25.870 --> 00:17:29.290
The novel is written in an EPIs style as a collection of letters,

293
00:17:29.291 --> 00:17:33.410
telegrams journal entries, even transcripts of wax cylinder recordings.

294
00:17:33.520 --> 00:17:37.360
It's sort of the predecessor to today's found footage, ho flicks,

295
00:17:37.420 --> 00:17:38.760
if you like this star,

296
00:17:38.761 --> 00:17:42.520
wasn't entirely new as Frankenstein by Mary Shelley also relied on journal

297
00:17:42.521 --> 00:17:43.140
entries,

298
00:17:43.140 --> 00:17:47.120
but Stoker's innovation was his ability to multiply the perspectives on the

299
00:17:47.121 --> 00:17:50.840
supernatural events of the story, as well as to make the written records.

300
00:17:51.110 --> 00:17:54.280
Part of the story itself. As one piece of plot developments,

301
00:17:54.340 --> 00:17:58.840
the under Lord tries to destroy the very archived records that are driving the

302
00:17:58.841 --> 00:18:01.760
plot of the actual novel as they could reveal too much about him.

303
00:18:01.910 --> 00:18:05.600
It's a blend of storytelling and plot device is that was extremely ahead of its

304
00:18:05.601 --> 00:18:06.180
time.

305
00:18:06.180 --> 00:18:10.990
The other factor that ensure the novels popular and longevity is the variety of

306
00:18:10.991 --> 00:18:13.270
interpretations to which it lends itself.

307
00:18:13.271 --> 00:18:15.550
According to John Sutherlands of the Irish times,

308
00:18:15.570 --> 00:18:19.470
Stoker was influenced by the moral panic about immigration.

309
00:18:19.580 --> 00:18:22.190
This was something experienced by Victorian society.

310
00:18:22.191 --> 00:18:23.430
At the end of the 19th century,

311
00:18:23.750 --> 00:18:26.710
a Brexit here could summarize the plot as such an illegal immigrants from

312
00:18:26.711 --> 00:18:28.510
Eastern Europe, occupies several squats in London,

313
00:18:28.511 --> 00:18:33.500
hoping to prey on local women that probably wouldn't do much for urban property

314
00:18:33.501 --> 00:18:34.500
values critic.

315
00:18:35.100 --> 00:18:38.900
Paul Murray from Oxford university sees the plot of Dr. As an allegory of male

316
00:18:38.990 --> 00:18:43.460
insecurity and the dangers of subservient to another person could this perhaps

317
00:18:43.520 --> 00:18:47.580
be Irving too. Murray also points out how modern commentators see the novel.

318
00:18:47.800 --> 00:18:52.450
He says deviant and taboo forms of sexuality, including rape incest,

319
00:18:52.490 --> 00:18:57.370
adultery, oral sex group, sex sex during administration, bestiality, pedophilia,

320
00:18:57.880 --> 00:19:00.810
veal disease, and voyeurism among other things.

321
00:19:01.310 --> 00:19:03.850
And at this point we wonder among other things really,

322
00:19:03.851 --> 00:19:06.210
it does seem like you covered everything there.

323
00:19:06.350 --> 00:19:10.680
And it does make it sound a bit as if Stoker used VAM as a thin disguised

324
00:19:10.681 --> 00:19:12.800
portrayal of his sexual proclivities.

325
00:19:13.060 --> 00:19:17.240
Now professor Peus of soton university college has a compelling opposing view

326
00:19:17.380 --> 00:19:19.280
Stoker Oja shortly after his friend,

327
00:19:19.281 --> 00:19:22.360
Oscar wild had been tried and sentenced for homosexual acts.

328
00:19:22.361 --> 00:19:26.440
And this may have led the author to view sexuality as a painful source of evil

329
00:19:26.510 --> 00:19:30.200
stating Dracula shows Stoker's suspicions and anxiety,

330
00:19:31.030 --> 00:19:35.150
all forms of sexuality, especially towards those considered to be perverse.

331
00:19:35.570 --> 00:19:39.870
The simple attractions of the count suggest stokers fears about his own

332
00:19:39.940 --> 00:19:42.990
sexuality, stepping away from sex. For one,

333
00:19:43.050 --> 00:19:46.390
you can also find a Marxist allegory in this VAM part,

334
00:19:46.530 --> 00:19:49.830
at least according to Franco MITI of Stanford university,

335
00:19:49.930 --> 00:19:54.460
he argues that the novel was about the crisis of liberal capitalism taking place

336
00:19:54.461 --> 00:19:59.140
within the 1890s, put in jeopardy by the by of monopolies Camra.

337
00:19:59.370 --> 00:20:00.580
Then as a solitary,

338
00:20:01.140 --> 00:20:05.260
despot represents a monopoly capital who increases its power by feeding on and

339
00:20:05.450 --> 00:20:10.100
enslaving the Ariat car marks himself once wrote something that seems to support

340
00:20:10.101 --> 00:20:12.890
this theory saying capital is dead labor,

341
00:20:12.891 --> 00:20:17.530
which vampire like lives only by sucking living labor and lives. The more,

342
00:20:18.010 --> 00:20:19.050
the more labor it sucks.

343
00:20:25.350 --> 00:20:29.450
The publication and early success of Dracula brought enormous attention to Bram

344
00:20:29.470 --> 00:20:29.950
Stoker.

345
00:20:29.950 --> 00:20:33.560
He had clearly got his break and he was going to exploit his intellectual

346
00:20:33.680 --> 00:20:34.520
property as much as possible.

347
00:20:34.900 --> 00:20:38.080
Stoker immediately understood the theatrical potential of his novel.

348
00:20:38.180 --> 00:20:41.080
But before he set off to work on an adaptation,

349
00:20:41.140 --> 00:20:44.280
he decided to stage a public reading at the Lim,

350
00:20:44.560 --> 00:20:47.120
a common tactic to secure copyright for stage purposes.

351
00:20:47.520 --> 00:20:49.600
Brad offered to give Henry Aing the lead role.

352
00:20:49.860 --> 00:20:52.720
It would've been the perfect casting, but he refused.

353
00:20:52.721 --> 00:20:56.400
However he did attend the reading. And what did he think of it? Well,

354
00:20:56.660 --> 00:21:01.320
it was dreadful. This was the start of a rift between the two friends,

355
00:21:01.540 --> 00:21:06.360
the gap widened when Irving son Lawrence joins the Lim company in 1898

356
00:21:06.750 --> 00:21:09.030
as a director and playwrights BA is only natural.

357
00:21:09.120 --> 00:21:12.830
Henry started paying more attention to his son's own advice than stokers

358
00:21:13.710 --> 00:21:15.270
realized that he was being sidelines.

359
00:21:15.290 --> 00:21:19.670
And laed not being able to see Henry as often as before the following year,

360
00:21:20.150 --> 00:21:24.230
raving ignored Stoker's advice not to sell the Eli cm to a limited company three

361
00:21:24.231 --> 00:21:26.670
years after that in 1902, the company declared bankruptcy.

362
00:21:27.080 --> 00:21:30.860
And then I see him had to be shut down on October the 13th, 1905,

363
00:21:30.870 --> 00:21:34.780
Henry eing suffered an onstage stroke and died that very day.

364
00:21:35.120 --> 00:21:39.180
His will did not make any mention of the man who had been his loyal friends and

365
00:21:39.181 --> 00:21:43.380
manager for almost 30 years. Shortly afterwards, Stoker also had a stroke,

366
00:21:43.480 --> 00:21:46.940
but he partially recovered and went on to write a biography about Henry.

367
00:21:47.990 --> 00:21:52.850
It was called personal reminisces of Henry Irving beyond the Irving biography.

368
00:21:53.000 --> 00:21:56.610
Bram had not neglected his fiction. Writing alternating horror with romance.

369
00:21:56.870 --> 00:22:01.250
His novels of mystery and horror include the Juul of seven stars from 1903,

370
00:22:01.490 --> 00:22:05.690
a tale of adventure in romance set in Egypt and the layer of the white worm from

371
00:22:05.970 --> 00:22:06.600
1911.

372
00:22:06.600 --> 00:22:11.280
This is perhaps his most famous this novel beside Dr. As it was popularized by

373
00:22:11.281 --> 00:22:14.000
Ken Russell's film adaptation of 1988,

374
00:22:14.001 --> 00:22:17.640
starring a young pre romcom hug grant layer of the white worm.

375
00:22:17.641 --> 00:22:21.760
There's some similarity to Dracula as victims are found with bite marks on their

376
00:22:21.810 --> 00:22:23.440
necks and the main antagonists.

377
00:22:23.800 --> 00:22:26.120
So scheming aristocrats with supernatural powers,

378
00:22:26.420 --> 00:22:30.270
but here the ultimate fo is a giant worm with glowing eyes,

379
00:22:30.440 --> 00:22:34.950
which is ultimately defeated. Spoiler of that with a lot of dynamite.

380
00:22:35.220 --> 00:22:35.711
Overall,

381
00:22:35.711 --> 00:22:39.830
the plot of the novel is muddled by unnecessary characters and dead end sub

382
00:22:39.840 --> 00:22:43.270
plots, which may have been a consequence of stokers declining health.

383
00:22:43.410 --> 00:22:46.350
He never fully recovered the 1906 stroke. In fact,

384
00:22:46.950 --> 00:22:51.180
Stoker continued to suffer from more strokes as aged until a final one claimed

385
00:22:51.181 --> 00:22:53.660
his life on April the 20th, 1912,

386
00:22:53.930 --> 00:22:57.900
that is at least according to his obituary. According to Daniel Faron,

387
00:22:57.901 --> 00:22:58.940
Stoker's grand nephew,

388
00:22:59.160 --> 00:23:03.020
the death certificate reports as his cause of death locomotor,

389
00:23:03.220 --> 00:23:08.180
a taxi also known in the early 20th century as general paralysis of the insane

390
00:23:08.220 --> 00:23:12.410
a condition associated with, with syphilis Stoker's definitive cause of death.

391
00:23:12.480 --> 00:23:17.050
It's still open to speculation today as is the case with well,

392
00:23:17.080 --> 00:23:18.530
many other aspects of his life.

393
00:23:18.830 --> 00:23:23.770
So what was the true nature of his relationship with Henry Irving and with Walt

394
00:23:23.771 --> 00:23:25.970
Whitman, or maybe even with Oscar wild?

395
00:23:26.240 --> 00:23:29.890
What hidden messages lurk between the lines of his work? Well,

396
00:23:30.560 --> 00:23:33.760
we will never know, but that isn't necessarily a bad thing.

397
00:23:33.940 --> 00:23:38.560
The man left us something more meaningful to focus on a masterpiece called

398
00:23:38.630 --> 00:23:39.463
Dracula,

399
00:23:39.480 --> 00:23:44.440

400
