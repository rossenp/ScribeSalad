00:00:13.501 --> 00:00:14.334
in a bit.

7
00:00:19.910 --> 00:00:22.670
Sometimes history throws us a figure. So dynamic,

8
00:00:22.671 --> 00:00:26.510
it seems like they've witnessed every important events of their era.

9
00:00:26.840 --> 00:00:30.980
In the case of the Marquis de Lafayette, he didn't just witness these events.

10
00:00:31.190 --> 00:00:34.580
He often caused them born in the latter half of the 18th century.

11
00:00:34.610 --> 00:00:39.050
Lafayette's life reads like a spec scripts for an Epic Oscar winner.

12
00:00:39.140 --> 00:00:42.620
As a teenager, he fought in the American revolutionary war as a young man.

13
00:00:42.621 --> 00:00:46.940
He spearheaded the first phase of the French revolution before fleeing a death

14
00:00:46.941 --> 00:00:50.660
sentence at the guillotine. He was friends with George Washington, Louis,

15
00:00:50.661 --> 00:00:51.470
the 16th,

16
00:00:51.470 --> 00:00:56.090
Thomas Jefferson and Simon Boulevard then was instrumental in both the downfall

17
00:00:56.120 --> 00:00:56.960
of Napoleon.

18
00:00:57.250 --> 00:01:02.060
And as the revolution that overthrew Francis lost Borbon King and Schultz

19
00:01:02.420 --> 00:01:05.480
laughing. Yes, it was a dude who packs a lot into his seven decades,

20
00:01:05.510 --> 00:01:08.990
but while he remains famous for his role in the revolutionary war,

21
00:01:09.110 --> 00:01:11.750
how much do we really know about the rest of his life,

22
00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:16.400
about the man who was at the forefront of North one, but two French revolutions.

23
00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:20.000
Join us today. As we peak inside the life of the market, you laugh.

24
00:01:20.001 --> 00:01:24.200
I ask the man who changed the fate of both America and Europe.

25
00:01:31.070 --> 00:01:31.130
<v 1>[Inaudible].</v>

26
00:01:31.130 --> 00:01:35.390
<v 0>When the market user Lafayette was born on September the sixth, 1757 in France.</v>

27
00:01:35.540 --> 00:01:38.690
It was into an old noble family of soldiers. In fact,

28
00:01:38.691 --> 00:01:41.510
the Marquis de Lafayette is an aristocratic title,

29
00:01:41.540 --> 00:01:45.230
but since his real name was Marie Joseph, Paul evade, Roche, Gilbert emoji,

30
00:01:45.260 --> 00:01:46.220
Marquis de Lafayette.

31
00:01:46.400 --> 00:01:50.450
We're just going to go with Lafayette for the rest of this video because it's

32
00:01:50.451 --> 00:01:54.190
easier. But while young Lafayette was both pampered and connected,

33
00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:58.760
he learns to ride horses in the company of three future Kings life.

34
00:01:58.761 --> 00:02:00.950
Wasn't exactly easy. When he was barely two,

35
00:02:00.951 --> 00:02:03.230
his father was killed fighting in the seven years war.

36
00:02:03.380 --> 00:02:05.930
By the time he turned 13 and 1770,

37
00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:10.130
it also lost his mother and his grandfather still the gigantic fortune.

38
00:02:10.131 --> 00:02:14.120
He inherited it must have softened the blow come 1774 laugh.

39
00:02:14.121 --> 00:02:16.430
I was married and the courtier routes,

40
00:02:16.460 --> 00:02:20.090
the Versailles of newly crowned King Louis, the 16th.

41
00:02:20.150 --> 00:02:24.980
But Lafayette came from fighting stock. The pompous luxury of a side bought him.

42
00:02:25.190 --> 00:02:29.870
He wanted to win glory as a soldier to go and fight in some great war somewhere.

43
00:02:29.930 --> 00:02:32.300
Luckily for him, one of the greatest Wars in history,

44
00:02:32.350 --> 00:02:35.600
it was about to blow up on April the 19th, 1775,

45
00:02:35.630 --> 00:02:40.280
the growing animosity between Britain and its American colonies finally exploded

46
00:02:40.281 --> 00:02:44.240
when a bunch of soldiers and local militiamen clashed at the towns of Lexington

47
00:02:44.480 --> 00:02:47.960
and Concord. It was the opening salvo of the revolutionary war.

48
00:02:47.990 --> 00:02:52.070
Often referred to as the shot heard around the world over in France,

49
00:02:52.071 --> 00:02:56.270
the Marquis de Lafayette certainly heard it by the summer of 1777,

50
00:02:56.271 --> 00:02:57.530
19 year old laugh. I added,

51
00:02:57.590 --> 00:03:00.190
it becomes so obsessed with the war raging in America,

52
00:03:00.520 --> 00:03:02.980
that he decided to go and join in that July.

53
00:03:02.981 --> 00:03:06.640
He arrived in Philadelphia where he presented himself to the continental

54
00:03:06.641 --> 00:03:08.140
Congress. The Congress took one,

55
00:03:08.141 --> 00:03:11.890
look at this scrawny teenager with no battle experience and told him to perform

56
00:03:11.891 --> 00:03:14.770
an act of intercourse upon his own buttocks.

57
00:03:14.860 --> 00:03:17.860
At least they did until the market declared that he was willing to fight for

58
00:03:17.861 --> 00:03:22.090
free at which points the calculation changed. And the summer of 1777,

59
00:03:22.150 --> 00:03:25.390
the war was not going well for the Americans. Smallpox was devastating.

60
00:03:25.570 --> 00:03:29.200
Their ranks that only one symbolic victories, as opposed to useful ones.

61
00:03:29.410 --> 00:03:32.770
And the British were on the verge of capturing Philadelphia right now,

62
00:03:32.800 --> 00:03:35.560
Congress would take any free help they could get,

63
00:03:35.590 --> 00:03:39.910
which was out George Washington found himself on July the 31st face-to-face with

64
00:03:39.940 --> 00:03:44.140
a rich French teenager who had somehow been given the rank of major general

65
00:03:44.200 --> 00:03:47.440
Washington had been settled before with useless European Royals.

66
00:03:47.560 --> 00:03:50.650
He came over to find because they were rich and looking for adventure.

67
00:03:51.430 --> 00:03:53.890
Invariably, they turned out to be useless, even as Canon Nevada.

68
00:03:53.920 --> 00:03:57.340
There was no reason to assume that this new one would be any difference,

69
00:03:57.550 --> 00:03:59.230
but Washington's snap judgment.

70
00:03:59.350 --> 00:04:02.200
What turned out to be wrong over the month of August 17, 77,

71
00:04:02.380 --> 00:04:06.070
Lafayette arose from being someone Washington couldn't stand the sight of to his

72
00:04:06.071 --> 00:04:07.000
personal favorite.

73
00:04:07.120 --> 00:04:10.780
They tell us that Lafayette was brave and battle and a natural leader of men at

74
00:04:10.900 --> 00:04:11.980
blank. Blankly helps even more.

75
00:04:11.981 --> 00:04:15.880
That both Washington and Lafayette were looking for someone to fill an emotional

76
00:04:15.881 --> 00:04:17.770
hole in their lives. As many have noted,

77
00:04:18.310 --> 00:04:21.880
Lafayette wound up becoming the childless Washington's surrogate son at the same

78
00:04:21.881 --> 00:04:22.181
time,

79
00:04:22.181 --> 00:04:25.870
Washington seems to have filled the father shaped void and Lafayette's life.

80
00:04:26.080 --> 00:04:29.950
The two became incredibly close in a matter of weeks where Lafayette was wounded

81
00:04:29.951 --> 00:04:33.610
in the backs of the Brandywine that autumn Washington had his personal

82
00:04:33.611 --> 00:04:34.840
physician. It tends to the lab.

83
00:04:34.990 --> 00:04:38.950
It was the start of a long relationship that would hugely influenced both men.

84
00:04:39.190 --> 00:04:41.860
It would also hugely influence the course of American history.

85
00:04:47.790 --> 00:04:48.180
<v 1>[Inaudible].</v>

86
00:04:48.180 --> 00:04:52.050
<v 0>Under Washington's tutelage, the Maki soon blooms into a great general.</v>

87
00:04:52.080 --> 00:04:55.980
He pulls off an impossible retreat from barren Hill and was instrumental in

88
00:04:56.640 --> 00:04:59.880
harrying Benedict Donald's forces in 1781 more importantly, though,

89
00:05:00.030 --> 00:05:04.860
he seemed became the fledgling nation's best ambassador in 1779, Lafite attra,

90
00:05:04.861 --> 00:05:08.580
tons of froms to drum up support for the American revolutionaries.

91
00:05:08.640 --> 00:05:12.180
Although Louis the 16th didn't need much convincing that screwing with Brisbane

92
00:05:12.181 --> 00:05:14.580
was trebian. It's still impressive.

93
00:05:14.640 --> 00:05:18.210
How much age the Maki returned with in April 17, 80 laugh.

94
00:05:18.211 --> 00:05:20.160
I answered triumphantly reported to Washington,

95
00:05:20.310 --> 00:05:24.300
that 6,000 infantry and six ships while on their way from France.

96
00:05:24.510 --> 00:05:27.990
That is the most impressive moment of all would come in 1781 that summer in the

97
00:05:27.991 --> 00:05:31.410
run-up to Yorktown Washington, watered both Lafayette and mad.

98
00:05:31.411 --> 00:05:33.840
Anthony wanes head South into Virginia,

99
00:05:33.990 --> 00:05:37.050
both their troops mutinied at the news of yet more fighting.

100
00:05:37.080 --> 00:05:40.770
But while Matt Anthony lived up to his reputation by executing the ringleaders

101
00:05:40.771 --> 00:05:43.890
and displaying their bodies, Lafayette took a different approach.

102
00:05:43.950 --> 00:05:45.810
He told his men, they were free to go.

103
00:05:45.990 --> 00:05:49.290
He leveled with the soldiers saying they were heading into danger,

104
00:05:49.291 --> 00:05:53.310
that many of them would make it, that the British might annihilate them all,

105
00:05:53.340 --> 00:05:55.650
but he also reminded them what they were fighting for.

106
00:05:55.740 --> 00:05:58.100
Why that signed up to be in the first place,

107
00:05:58.190 --> 00:06:02.000
what this new nation could represent in the wake of Lafayette speech,

108
00:06:02.030 --> 00:06:04.070
nearly all of the dessert is returned. Now,

109
00:06:04.160 --> 00:06:07.970
if I rewarded them by spending his own money on new boots and blankets,

110
00:06:08.060 --> 00:06:12.350
and then as one they marched down toward Yorktown and did the history,

111
00:06:12.650 --> 00:06:16.070
it was Paul and he was responsible for trapping law.

112
00:06:16.100 --> 00:06:18.560
Charles called Wallace at Yorktown in late July,

113
00:06:18.740 --> 00:06:20.930
once Cornwallis surrendered on October the 19th,

114
00:06:21.080 --> 00:06:24.860
it was effectively the end of the revolutionary war in the aftermath of the

115
00:06:24.861 --> 00:06:26.540
British, having their offices handed to them.

116
00:06:26.690 --> 00:06:29.750
Lafayette was hailed as the hero of two Wells.

117
00:06:29.810 --> 00:06:33.080
Many of the States made him an honorary citizen returning to France.

118
00:06:33.081 --> 00:06:36.470
He was promoted to Michelle to come Paul Brigadier general.

119
00:06:36.620 --> 00:06:38.660
It was a proud time in the Maki's life.

120
00:06:38.950 --> 00:06:43.100
Not yet 25 had helped engineer the success of the American revolution at that

121
00:06:43.101 --> 00:06:46.280
time, the most significant revolt in living memory literal,

122
00:06:46.281 --> 00:06:50.180
could he have known that this was just a warmup for the main act

123
00:06:56.380 --> 00:07:00.640
In the latter half of the 1780s, France made a grizzly discovery. It was broke.

124
00:07:00.670 --> 00:07:02.290
The Royal treasury was empty.

125
00:07:02.440 --> 00:07:06.880
Credit lines were maxed out in the face of a Countrywide financial collapse.

126
00:07:07.270 --> 00:07:11.170
Louie, the 16th made a fateful decision. The summons, the estates general,

127
00:07:11.200 --> 00:07:14.860
the estates general was a meeting of Frances three estates.

128
00:07:14.861 --> 00:07:16.630
The aristocracy to which laugh.

129
00:07:16.631 --> 00:07:21.130
I belonged the church and the commoners generally French Kings avoided calling

130
00:07:21.131 --> 00:07:25.900
the estates general. The last meeting had been in 16, 14, 174 years previously.

131
00:07:26.080 --> 00:07:29.170
But if Louie wanted to head off the Bruin crisis,

132
00:07:29.350 --> 00:07:31.930
he had no choice on may the fourth, 1789,

133
00:07:31.931 --> 00:07:35.770
1,200 representatives of the three estates convened in Paris.

134
00:07:36.070 --> 00:07:39.910
Along that number was laughed at. It likes it as a deputy of the nobility,

135
00:07:40.000 --> 00:07:43.240
but while I laugh, I was lumped in with all the other French fancy pantsy.

136
00:07:43.410 --> 00:07:47.860
Wasn't just another posh twit had spent years immersed in the ideals of American

137
00:07:47.861 --> 00:07:48.580
independence.

138
00:07:48.580 --> 00:07:52.330
And now he was going to bring them to frumps whether his countrymen liked it or

139
00:07:52.331 --> 00:07:52.900
not.

140
00:07:52.900 --> 00:07:56.920
The estates general officially opens on may the fifth and quickly devolved from

141
00:07:56.921 --> 00:08:01.780
a meeting about state finances to a massive pylon in which everyone

142
00:08:01.781 --> 00:08:05.820
took turns about the ALCL regime. The Coleman is, Oh,

143
00:08:05.920 --> 00:08:08.470
we're fed up with living in convoluted backwards,

144
00:08:08.890 --> 00:08:12.310
froms filled with pointless privileges and regressive taxation,

145
00:08:12.400 --> 00:08:16.300
but they were also fed up with being out-voted and pushed around by the other

146
00:08:16.301 --> 00:08:18.310
two estates. So on June the 17th,

147
00:08:18.340 --> 00:08:20.620
the third estates deputies declared themselves.

148
00:08:20.621 --> 00:08:22.450
They sovereign national assembly.

149
00:08:22.510 --> 00:08:24.130
The whole thing was organized with the help of laugh.

150
00:08:24.131 --> 00:08:26.710
I asked one of the few Nobles who joined the assembly.

151
00:08:26.770 --> 00:08:29.200
The King tried to council by having the meeting hall logs,

152
00:08:29.201 --> 00:08:32.890
but the assembly repaired to a tennis court where everyone took an oath not to

153
00:08:32.891 --> 00:08:36.520
disband until that forced a liberal constitution on France.

154
00:08:36.580 --> 00:08:39.280
And they had just the guy to write it with help from his buddy,

155
00:08:39.310 --> 00:08:40.180
Thomas Jefferson,

156
00:08:40.650 --> 00:08:44.020
Lafayette drafted the declaration of rights of men and of the citizen.

157
00:08:44.200 --> 00:08:48.340
One of the most important documents ever written in its Lafayette Sandtown his

158
00:08:48.341 --> 00:08:52.660
conception of universal rights with a strong emphasis on personal Liberty.

159
00:08:52.900 --> 00:08:55.830
Although the assembly would redraft his work before adopting it.

160
00:08:55.980 --> 00:08:59.130
Lafayette's ideas still heavily influenced the final version,

161
00:08:59.160 --> 00:09:01.410
but the Markey's effects on the French revolution.

162
00:09:01.440 --> 00:09:03.510
Weren't going to stop with one document.

163
00:09:03.600 --> 00:09:06.390
Three days after laughing had presented the assembly with his draft,

164
00:09:06.391 --> 00:09:09.840
a prissy and mob storms, the best deal and the Paris hotel Deville,

165
00:09:09.990 --> 00:09:11.190
a fancy name for city hall.

166
00:09:11.220 --> 00:09:15.180
The morning after representatives of Paris is 60 districts convened on the hotel

167
00:09:15.360 --> 00:09:18.540
and declared the creation of their own national assembly.

168
00:09:18.780 --> 00:09:21.300
The Paris commune as part of this shake of it.

169
00:09:21.720 --> 00:09:25.830
Citywide national guard was formed to replace the King's men and who could be a

170
00:09:25.831 --> 00:09:27.780
more natural fit as commander of the guards.

171
00:09:27.810 --> 00:09:31.530
Then the hero of two worlds on July, the 17th,

172
00:09:31.531 --> 00:09:34.410
they reluctance Louie came down from Versailles to meet the man.

173
00:09:34.411 --> 00:09:37.350
Now heading the army that effectively controlled Paris.

174
00:09:37.410 --> 00:09:40.110
He was taken inside the hotel developer, someone pins,

175
00:09:40.111 --> 00:09:43.230
a revolutionary red and blue co-located on his chest.

176
00:09:43.830 --> 00:09:47.430
Lafayette saw the King wearing the Caucasians, had a flash of inspiration,

177
00:09:47.490 --> 00:09:51.150
taking some whites class whites, being the color of the bulb and monarchy.

178
00:09:51.360 --> 00:09:55.080
He added a strip to the Kings Caucasians, then Lafayette and blue.

179
00:09:55.081 --> 00:09:59.070
The sixteens both went out onto the balcony where they gathered prisons shouted

180
00:09:59.490 --> 00:10:01.590
long, left the King. It was the birth of the Tricolore,

181
00:10:01.620 --> 00:10:05.070
the revolutionary symbol that is still the flag of France.

182
00:10:05.250 --> 00:10:08.430
It was also the marquee. He hoped the birth of a liberal Republic.

183
00:10:08.460 --> 00:10:12.270
One in which the King was a figurehead and to the actual governing was done by

184
00:10:12.450 --> 00:10:15.720
middle-class business types. But the market would be proven wrong on this one,

185
00:10:15.990 --> 00:10:18.240
far from wanting the King as a figurehead, the people of Paris.

186
00:10:18.241 --> 00:10:21.960
We're soon going to realize that they preferred their Kings without heads at

187
00:10:21.961 --> 00:10:25.770
all. And just before the French inevitably start lopping off people's heads.

188
00:10:25.771 --> 00:10:28.560
We do want to take a moment to tell you about today's wonderful sponsor,

189
00:10:28.570 --> 00:10:31.860
Squarespace with Squarespace. There's two things to keep in mind. One,

190
00:10:31.861 --> 00:10:35.640
maybe you've got some idea for a website or a business or a podcast or something

191
00:10:35.641 --> 00:10:37.290
knocking around in your mind. Well, two,

192
00:10:37.291 --> 00:10:40.500
the only way to figure out whether that's worth doing is to get it out there

193
00:10:40.501 --> 00:10:40.951
into the world.

194
00:10:40.951 --> 00:10:44.280
And that could be daunting because it's scary to go and pursue new things,

195
00:10:44.281 --> 00:10:47.160
but not knowing how to set up a website is not an excuse.

196
00:10:47.161 --> 00:10:49.320
There are no excuses available with Squarespace.

your heart's content. Or you could start from scratch,

202
00:11:06.870 --> 00:11:10.110
or you can move over from an existing domain, but just take my advice,

203
00:11:10.111 --> 00:11:13.140
use a template. They look great. It's easy, no excuses.

204
00:11:13.380 --> 00:11:16.290
And once you've gone through the easy customization process, no updates,

205
00:11:16.291 --> 00:11:19.740
no tech, the has to deal with none of that nonsense and Squarespace,

206
00:11:19.741 --> 00:11:22.530
all sounds all the website stuff. I said, they do podcasts,

207
00:11:22.531 --> 00:11:24.660
also mailing as social integrations, all of that stuff,

208
00:11:24.690 --> 00:11:26.850
and much more 24 seven customer support.

off your first purchase of a website or a domain let's get back to

212
00:11:44.930 --> 00:11:48.800
On Lafayette. Plant started coming off that same autumn on October the fifth,

213
00:11:48.950 --> 00:11:53.210
uh, right over bread prices in Paris, turned into an army of heavily armed,

214
00:11:53.380 --> 00:11:55.060
very unhappy women. The next day,

215
00:11:55.120 --> 00:11:59.230
they marched on the size of 19 kilometers distance. When Lafayette has got word,

216
00:11:59.231 --> 00:12:02.950
he first tried to stop them only to realize his guardsmen would mutiny if he did

217
00:12:03.280 --> 00:12:07.000
so. So the Marquis changed tack and rode down to the head of the angry women

218
00:12:07.120 --> 00:12:08.680
nominally there to protect them.

219
00:12:08.681 --> 00:12:12.060
But to actually wondering what the hell he was going to do when the mob arrived,

220
00:12:12.070 --> 00:12:16.030
a Lafayette zipped inside the palace to try and convince Louis to announce the

221
00:12:16.050 --> 00:12:19.470
support for the assemblies liberal reforms. While he was talking,

222
00:12:19.471 --> 00:12:20.910
the crowds invaded the palace,

223
00:12:20.911 --> 00:12:25.380
where they killed two gods and stuck their heads on Pikes, the situation,

224
00:12:25.381 --> 00:12:29.640
getting desperate. Lafayette forced the King onto a balcony to say his peace.

225
00:12:29.850 --> 00:12:30.900
It was a tense moment.

226
00:12:30.930 --> 00:12:34.650
The crowd could have easily broken in and lynched doctress Louie, but laugh.

227
00:12:34.651 --> 00:12:38.640
I had to, luckily though, the plan worked, the crowns began hollering long,

228
00:12:38.850 --> 00:12:43.020
live the King, do a score to live in his family back to Paris. We say offered,

229
00:12:43.050 --> 00:12:46.800
but it was more like they ordered him on the strict understanding that saying no

230
00:12:46.950 --> 00:12:49.200
would result in his head being stuck on a pike too.

231
00:12:49.410 --> 00:12:53.490
And so the Royal family escorted back to the Capitol and effectively imprisoned

232
00:12:53.610 --> 00:12:56.610
in the 2d a palace, but Lafayette had bought them time.

233
00:12:56.760 --> 00:13:00.410
Not only that had bought himself influence with the mob from now on,

234
00:13:00.460 --> 00:13:04.260
he was going to be at the very forefront of the French revolution for the next

235
00:13:04.290 --> 00:13:06.800
year and a half. That's exactly where laugh.

236
00:13:06.801 --> 00:13:10.740
I had stood as the assembly abolished feudalism and stripped powers from the

237
00:13:10.741 --> 00:13:14.820
aristocracy. He was the most visible symbol of the changes under his watch,

238
00:13:14.821 --> 00:13:16.590
the Wars Rosie gains new rights.

239
00:13:16.740 --> 00:13:20.880
It was the mannered liberal revolution of Lafayette streams. Sadly,

240
00:13:20.910 --> 00:13:22.440
it was already slipping out of his grasp.

241
00:13:22.500 --> 00:13:26.760
The Monkees fall from grace came on July the 17th, 1791. On that day,

242
00:13:26.761 --> 00:13:30.330
the Paris national guard opened the fire and a group of protestors demanding the

243
00:13:30.570 --> 00:13:34.860
King's resignation. 50 people were injured or killed as commander of the guard.

244
00:13:35.070 --> 00:13:37.920
Lafayette's popularity plummeted. He resigned his post,

245
00:13:37.980 --> 00:13:41.070
had himself transferred into the army with Lafayette sidelines.

246
00:13:41.100 --> 00:13:45.300
The radical elements began gaining power by April, 1792, the craziest war.

247
00:13:45.320 --> 00:13:48.000
So in a sense that France declared war on Austria,

248
00:13:48.030 --> 00:13:51.510
beginning a series of conflicts that would rack Europe for a quarter of a

249
00:13:51.511 --> 00:13:52.170
century,

250
00:13:52.170 --> 00:13:55.920
sends a lead one of the three main armies Lafayette Fritz ends from the front to

251
00:13:55.921 --> 00:13:59.070
Paris twice to denounce the radicals and plead for common sense.

252
00:13:59.190 --> 00:14:02.100
But no one was listening on August the 10th, 1792,

253
00:14:02.250 --> 00:14:05.100
a working class revolt in Paris over through the monarchy, right?

254
00:14:05.580 --> 00:14:09.450
Brought the hyper radical faction, headed by Robespierre to power.

255
00:14:09.600 --> 00:14:11.100
Seeing which way the winds were blowing.

256
00:14:11.101 --> 00:14:14.940
Lafayette abandoned his post and cross the lines into enemy territory.

257
00:14:15.330 --> 00:14:18.480
And it was just in time to before news even arrived as desertion,

258
00:14:18.481 --> 00:14:22.740
the assembly declared Lafayette to tracer effectively an invitation to come and

259
00:14:22.741 --> 00:14:26.550
dance with Madame guillotine. But although Lafayette escaped with his head,

260
00:14:26.790 --> 00:14:29.880
his nightmare wasn't over arrested by the Austrians, the marquee,

261
00:14:29.970 --> 00:14:33.030
it spent the next five years shuns ed between jails gleaming,

262
00:14:33.180 --> 00:14:37.020
the listening as the news from Fromm Scott West six months off to laugh,

263
00:14:37.021 --> 00:14:39.870
I ads crossed the lines and Louie was guillotined ending.

264
00:14:39.930 --> 00:14:44.130
Lafayette's hope of a constitutional monarchy. Another six months after this,

265
00:14:44.220 --> 00:14:45.300
the reign of terror. Again,

266
00:14:45.600 --> 00:14:48.630
although his former comrades in America begged versus release,

267
00:14:48.870 --> 00:14:50.070
there was nothing to be done. Laugh.

268
00:14:50.071 --> 00:14:53.600
I out had been sentenced to rot in the cell and Rossi woods,

269
00:14:54.170 --> 00:14:56.930
at least for a while, because in just a few short years,

270
00:14:56.931 --> 00:14:59.690
a great man would ride the Markey's rescue.

271
00:14:59.810 --> 00:15:02.540
Perhaps the greatest man in European history,

272
00:15:02.750 --> 00:15:07.610
his name was Napoleon Bonaparte and he would transform Francis. Fortunately.

273
00:15:14.290 --> 00:15:14.620
<v 1>[Inaudible].</v>

274
00:15:14.620 --> 00:15:17.170
<v 0>During Nathalia. ANSI is in prison. The situation in France,</v>

275
00:15:17.171 --> 00:15:20.320
gradually regressed on July the 27th, 1794,

276
00:15:20.350 --> 00:15:24.730
also known as nine Thermador year two Robespierre was overthrown and

277
00:15:24.731 --> 00:15:27.730
subsequently guillotines in the wake of the Therma Dorian reaction,

278
00:15:27.760 --> 00:15:32.140
the directory Rose to power corrupt and reaction Raisy French directory.

279
00:15:32.200 --> 00:15:35.140
It would last a minute, four years before it was overthrown.

280
00:15:35.170 --> 00:15:38.980
But luckily for our story today, it did two very important things.

281
00:15:38.981 --> 00:15:40.330
In those four years,

282
00:15:40.390 --> 00:15:45.040
the first was to promote a promising young general named Napoleon and get him to

283
00:15:45.041 --> 00:15:48.520
invade Austria, to force an end to the war. The second was doing cyst.

284
00:15:48.521 --> 00:15:52.660
Any peace deal included the freeing of the Marquis de Lafayette on September the

285
00:15:52.661 --> 00:15:57.220
19th, 1797, Lafayette walked free of his Austrian prison. Uh,

286
00:15:57.221 --> 00:16:01.120
first the market, it was like, man, this is the Polian dude is awesome.

287
00:16:01.360 --> 00:16:05.470
But soon he was feeling significantly less cool about Francis new hero.

288
00:16:05.560 --> 00:16:09.280
He was worried about Napoleon's ambition about his lust for power.

289
00:16:09.340 --> 00:16:12.280
But if Lafayette thought Napoleon's ambition was a bit much.

290
00:16:12.310 --> 00:16:16.750
Now wait until he saw what happened next on November, the ninth, 1799,

291
00:16:16.751 --> 00:16:21.520
Napoleon overthrew the directory in the COO of 18 mat in place of the

292
00:16:21.521 --> 00:16:22.091
directory.

293
00:16:22.091 --> 00:16:25.510
He installed himself as the first concert of France dramatic as this was though

294
00:16:25.720 --> 00:16:28.450
Lafayette's attention was elsewhere on December the 14th,

295
00:16:28.451 --> 00:16:31.990
George Washington passed away in Virginia. Having already lost his real father.

296
00:16:32.020 --> 00:16:36.070
The marquee. Now he'd lost his surrogate one. This may help explain why not.

297
00:16:36.130 --> 00:16:38.260
If I had spent most of 1800 out of the picture,

298
00:16:38.350 --> 00:16:43.000
it wasn't until awesome that Napoleon tried courting the hero of two worlds.

299
00:16:43.030 --> 00:16:46.510
The incentive was an ambassadorship to America. When Lafayette gently,

300
00:16:46.570 --> 00:16:50.010
it sounded Napoleon outside France becoming a democracy. They're applying,

301
00:16:50.130 --> 00:16:50.410
he'd gone.

302
00:16:50.410 --> 00:16:54.580
Wasn't encouraging Zoloft at turn down the post and began speaking out against

303
00:16:54.581 --> 00:16:56.410
Napoleon in may of 1802.

304
00:16:56.560 --> 00:17:00.220
It was one of the lone voices to vote against Napoleon becoming the first

305
00:17:00.221 --> 00:17:01.990
console for life declaring.

306
00:17:02.230 --> 00:17:06.130
I cannot vote for such a magistracy until public Liberty has been sufficiently

307
00:17:06.131 --> 00:17:06.964
guaranteed,

308
00:17:07.030 --> 00:17:10.840
but that guarantee never came Lafayette reside from public service that same

309
00:17:11.170 --> 00:17:14.260
year. Although Thomas Jefferson offered to make a governor of newly purchased

310
00:17:14.261 --> 00:17:17.320
Louisiana in 1803, Lafayette refused.

311
00:17:17.380 --> 00:17:21.760
He also refused another offer from Napoleon's would be given an elevated rank in

312
00:17:21.761 --> 00:17:22.594
the Legion of honor.

313
00:17:22.720 --> 00:17:26.410
When the first consult finally had himself named emperor Napoleon on December

314
00:17:26.411 --> 00:17:28.060
the second day, do you know for laughing?

315
00:17:28.061 --> 00:17:30.640
It seems to have given up on politics entirely,

316
00:17:30.730 --> 00:17:33.100
but while it stay out of the game for nearly a decade,

317
00:17:33.370 --> 00:17:36.730
he wouldn't be able to resist coming back in April 18, 14,

318
00:17:36.910 --> 00:17:40.930
the war of the sixth coalition ended with Napoleon advocating and being sent

319
00:17:40.931 --> 00:17:44.560
into exile on the Island of Elba in the wake of the empire collapsed,

320
00:17:44.561 --> 00:17:48.910
the bull and monarchy was recalled to the French throne in the portly shape of

321
00:17:49.470 --> 00:17:52.620
Louis the 18th, the sights of yet another fat Louie on the throne.

322
00:17:52.620 --> 00:17:56.040
Wasn't exactly music to laugh at soul in his heart.

323
00:17:56.041 --> 00:18:00.060
He was still a child of the American revolution and would prefer a world without

324
00:18:00.061 --> 00:18:00.840
Royals,

325
00:18:00.840 --> 00:18:04.860
but when forced to choose between another Borbon King and Napoleon's continued

326
00:18:05.250 --> 00:18:08.580
rain, the marquee knew who he preferred on March. The first 18,

327
00:18:08.581 --> 00:18:12.600
15 Napoleon escaped the Island prison and returned to France.

328
00:18:12.990 --> 00:18:15.360
Louis the 18th flat on the emperor, marched on Paris.

329
00:18:15.900 --> 00:18:19.170
Kick-starting a period known as the hundred days disgusted at Napoleon's

330
00:18:19.171 --> 00:18:21.330
resurrection. BAFA had to left retirement.

331
00:18:21.390 --> 00:18:23.640
He took up a post in the chamber of deputies,

332
00:18:24.320 --> 00:18:27.090
determined to become a lone voice against the emperor tyranny.

333
00:18:27.390 --> 00:18:31.860
Instead as he winds up helping and his rule for good in the Optum off of

334
00:18:31.861 --> 00:18:36.450
Waterloo that June Napoleon's brother came to the chamber to rally support for

335
00:18:36.451 --> 00:18:38.460
the emperor. Instead, he was forced to listen.

336
00:18:38.580 --> 00:18:40.590
As Lafayette made a barnstorming speech,

337
00:18:40.950 --> 00:18:43.650
laying the deaths of millions and Napoleon's feet.

338
00:18:43.890 --> 00:18:47.490
It said many of the younger deputies hadn't realized until that moment that

339
00:18:47.700 --> 00:18:51.540
laugh. I, by now pushing 60 was still alive. Regardless.

340
00:18:51.600 --> 00:18:55.440
The speech whacked and its aftermath off Lafayette led the charge for Napoleon's

341
00:18:55.470 --> 00:18:57.900
second application on June, the 20 seconds,

342
00:18:58.200 --> 00:19:01.260
the emperor obliged before Napoleon went into a second acts.

343
00:19:01.261 --> 00:19:05.010
All the Maki went to the Tillary palace to thank him that Napoleon Massey,

344
00:19:05.070 --> 00:19:09.120
not with anger or outrage, but with a wry smile, you got rid of me.

345
00:19:09.240 --> 00:19:14.130
We like to think that smile said, but now the ball Barnes back, the Kings,

346
00:19:14.280 --> 00:19:17.190
you fought so hard to read Francis off 25 years ago.

347
00:19:17.790 --> 00:19:21.060
What are you going to do now? But off I would seem to have an onset,

348
00:19:21.120 --> 00:19:23.370
although no one in 1815 could have realized it.

349
00:19:23.520 --> 00:19:27.360
The marquee was destined to extinguish the bulb online once and for all.

350
00:19:33.290 --> 00:19:33.920
<v 1>[Inaudible].</v>

351
00:19:33.920 --> 00:19:36.410
<v 0>Well, the next 10 years were a decade of disappointment for laugh.</v>

352
00:19:36.411 --> 00:19:40.220
I asked initially willing to give Louis the 18th of Chauncey soon became

353
00:19:40.221 --> 00:19:43.850
convinced that the King needed to go starting around 18, 19.

354
00:19:44.420 --> 00:19:45.920
Lafayette's began clandestinely funding,

355
00:19:45.921 --> 00:19:50.200
liberal plots to overthrow the monarchy where they went nowhere by 1824,

356
00:19:50.220 --> 00:19:54.080
the marquee was frustrated and all too aware that the ball bonds were catching

357
00:19:54.081 --> 00:19:58.730
onto his schemes. You needed a break, a place to lie low and recalibrates,

358
00:19:58.731 --> 00:20:02.600
a place where he didn't carry all the baggage that he did in France.

359
00:20:02.660 --> 00:20:05.540
Luckily that place was only a boat ride away that year.

360
00:20:05.570 --> 00:20:07.310
President James Monterey wrote to laugh.

361
00:20:07.311 --> 00:20:11.450
I add asking if it attends celebrations of America's 50th anniversary by now,

362
00:20:11.480 --> 00:20:14.660
Lafayette was the last surviving major general of the revolutionary war.

363
00:20:14.810 --> 00:20:18.080
One of the last links Americans had houses to the nation's birth laugh.

364
00:20:18.081 --> 00:20:19.880
I had accepted on July the 13th,

365
00:20:19.940 --> 00:20:24.650
1824 laugh ads left France to begin what would become a 13 month victory tour

366
00:20:24.800 --> 00:20:27.410
of all 24 us States, wherever he went,

367
00:20:27.411 --> 00:20:32.120
he was fated across 9,600 kilometers. He was cheered, welcomed and honored.

368
00:20:32.270 --> 00:20:35.600
It was a colossal outpouring of love towns where we named after him.

369
00:20:35.660 --> 00:20:38.930
If you live in one of the dozens of places in the U S names, laugh,

370
00:20:38.931 --> 00:20:43.140
I ask John's is all it was named during this journey. By the ends of the Maki.

371
00:20:43.220 --> 00:20:47.000
You had seen Jefferson for the last time and visited Washington's grave had even

372
00:20:47.140 --> 00:20:50.290
Simon Boulevard's nephew who was studying in the United States.

373
00:20:50.500 --> 00:20:54.130
When Lafayette heard the great South American revolutionary had been inspired by

374
00:20:54.131 --> 00:20:56.200
his exploits. You decide to drink to him.

375
00:20:56.410 --> 00:20:59.790
And that's how boulevards Lafayette wound up becoming pen pals.

376
00:20:59.791 --> 00:21:01.350
In the last years of their lives.

377
00:21:01.410 --> 00:21:04.950
By the time Lafayette's left America on September the sixth, 1835,

378
00:21:05.190 --> 00:21:06.960
he was pretty much all loved out.

379
00:21:07.170 --> 00:21:11.520
And that was probably for the best because France was by now a pretty

380
00:21:11.521 --> 00:21:14.370
unlovable place. Back in 1824, blue,

381
00:21:14.380 --> 00:21:18.660
the 18th had died and the throne had passed to his brother, Charles the 10th.

382
00:21:18.810 --> 00:21:20.460
But while Louis had been a Royal pain,

383
00:21:20.461 --> 00:21:24.780
Charles was a throbbing Dick convinced of his divine, right to rule.

384
00:21:24.781 --> 00:21:27.120
He tore up the last shreds of French liberalism,

385
00:21:27.270 --> 00:21:31.710
replacing it with a hardcore Catholic hardcore conservative,

386
00:21:31.860 --> 00:21:35.250
absolute monarchy. It was almost like the revolution had never happens.

387
00:21:35.460 --> 00:21:38.100
Charles was trying to turn back the clock.

388
00:21:38.460 --> 00:21:43.380
The 1789 Lafayette's last great act would be ensuring that he didn't succeed

389
00:21:43.740 --> 00:21:44.700
on July the 26th,

390
00:21:44.730 --> 00:21:48.930
1830 Charles pushed something called the four ordinances effectively,

391
00:21:49.080 --> 00:21:53.130
a Royal coup they suspended freedom of the press stopped almost everyone in the

392
00:21:53.131 --> 00:21:56.100
nation from voting and removed the last checks of the case.

393
00:21:56.880 --> 00:21:59.700
Charles thought it would be fait accompli.

394
00:21:59.850 --> 00:22:02.400
Instead it became a revolution for Brazilians.

395
00:22:02.401 --> 00:22:06.390
The four ordinances were the last straw. They Rose up spontaneous driving.

396
00:22:06.690 --> 00:22:10.350
Charles is forces into retreat in just three days known as the three glory.

397
00:22:11.190 --> 00:22:14.490
But while the marquee and his liberal friends were happy to see Charles go,

398
00:22:14.700 --> 00:22:18.330
they were less happy at the thought of all these angry Parisians suddenly

399
00:22:18.390 --> 00:22:19.410
wheeling out the guillotine.

400
00:22:19.560 --> 00:22:22.770
So they decided to get out ahead of the revolution while they still could.

401
00:22:23.040 --> 00:22:26.820
Conscripting Charles, his cousin, Louis, Felipe. They had him ride into Paris,

402
00:22:26.850 --> 00:22:30.120
draped in a trickle or a right through the revolutionary crowds,

403
00:22:30.180 --> 00:22:34.180
all the way to the hotel develop their awaiting. Lafayette took the future King,

404
00:22:34.380 --> 00:22:39.360
the balcony just as he had done with poor Louis, the 16th all those decades ago.

405
00:22:39.750 --> 00:22:43.410
And he's waving the trickle or the two men embraced at the sight of the hero of

406
00:22:43.411 --> 00:22:45.840
two worlds, bestowing his blessing on the new King.

407
00:22:46.140 --> 00:22:50.700
The crowd went nuts with that one kiss. Lafayette ended the July revolution.

408
00:22:50.880 --> 00:22:51.571
A few days later,

409
00:22:51.571 --> 00:22:55.290
Louis Phillipe was made head of a liberal business friendly monarchy with proper

410
00:22:55.291 --> 00:22:59.820
checks and balances. It was the moment the Marquis had dreamed of since 1789,

411
00:22:59.970 --> 00:23:03.210
a liberal system for France in which the King was mostly a figurehead and

412
00:23:03.211 --> 00:23:06.000
individual freedoms were secured. But you know what they say,

413
00:23:06.180 --> 00:23:08.640
be careful what you wish for over the next four years.

414
00:23:08.641 --> 00:23:12.690
Lafayette grew increasingly disillusioned with the July monarchy and it's slow

415
00:23:12.750 --> 00:23:15.810
bumbling toward authoritarianism. By the end of his life.

416
00:23:15.840 --> 00:23:19.680
He was one of the Louie Felipe's harshest critics are constant thorn in the King

417
00:23:19.681 --> 00:23:21.450
side. Luckily for the new King,

418
00:23:21.840 --> 00:23:26.310
I figured wouldn't be around much longer on may the 20th, 1834, eight 76.

419
00:23:26.460 --> 00:23:28.800
The Marquis de Lafayette died in Paris.

420
00:23:28.950 --> 00:23:32.760
Although many mourns in Lummi Felipe refuse to allow eulogies at his funeral.

421
00:23:32.761 --> 00:23:34.960
Even having him buried under armed guard.

422
00:23:35.160 --> 00:23:39.300
It was a bitter end to an extraordinary life in a seven decades on this earth.

423
00:23:39.630 --> 00:23:40.770
Now, if I asked it repeatedly,

424
00:23:40.830 --> 00:23:44.010
it found himself at the center of events that changed world history,

425
00:23:44.190 --> 00:23:47.330
the revolutionary, the French revolution, the downfall of Napoleon.

426
00:23:47.540 --> 00:23:51.380
These are all hugely significant events that would have played out very

427
00:23:51.381 --> 00:23:53.180
differently without the Marquis.

428
00:23:53.510 --> 00:23:55.850
And then they're all the documents that he left behind.

429
00:23:56.030 --> 00:23:59.330
The one in the French constitution still incorporates the declaration on the

430
00:23:59.331 --> 00:24:02.120
rights of man over 200 years after Lafayette wrote it,

431
00:24:02.210 --> 00:24:06.530
but it's not just what he did or who he met. The makes the Maki impressive.

432
00:24:06.860 --> 00:24:08.600
It's what he stood for all his life.

433
00:24:08.630 --> 00:24:12.530
Lafayette was a tireless champion for individual Liberty and freedom from

434
00:24:12.531 --> 00:24:16.370
tyranny. These were causes that took him to the battlefields of America,

435
00:24:16.550 --> 00:24:21.380
into the heart of Francis revolution. Even into an Austrian prison time.

436
00:24:21.381 --> 00:24:25.010
After time, people asked him to sell out the Polian Louie, the eighteens,

437
00:24:25.280 --> 00:24:29.390
Louis Felipe, and each time the marquee never wavered in his beliefs.

438
00:24:29.510 --> 00:24:31.850
It's often said that for evil to succeed,

439
00:24:32.000 --> 00:24:36.080
all it takes is for good men to do nothing. The life of the market or laugh.

440
00:24:36.081 --> 00:24:38.840
I ask, takes that saying to its opposite extreme.

441
00:24:38.990 --> 00:24:43.550
It shows what can succeed when a good man decides to do something to stand up

442
00:24:43.850 --> 00:24:45.710
to act, to be counted.

443
00:24:45.980 --> 00:24:50.900
When a man like Lafayette decides to do that well, then he can change the world.

444
00:24:51.320 --> 00:24:53.420
