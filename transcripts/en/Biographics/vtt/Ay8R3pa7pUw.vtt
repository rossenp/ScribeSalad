00:00:17.720 --> 00:00:19.820
It's one of the worst diseases in history.

5
00:00:19.850 --> 00:00:24.320
Smallpox spent millennia as the scourge of mankind, inflicting death,

6
00:00:24.530 --> 00:00:27.680
wherever it reared its ugly head in the 20th century alone,

7
00:00:27.681 --> 00:00:31.520
it killed some 300 million people, almost as many as the Spanish flu,

8
00:00:31.550 --> 00:00:35.210
but while survivors of the flu returned to normal survivors of smallpox will

9
00:00:35.211 --> 00:00:37.550
after damaged for life, blindness,

10
00:00:37.640 --> 00:00:41.060
infertility and hideous disfigurements were frequent outcomes.

11
00:00:41.180 --> 00:00:45.590
Ones that affected people from all segments of society, princes pharaohs,

12
00:00:45.710 --> 00:00:49.550
emperors, Queens, artists, warriors workers,

13
00:00:49.700 --> 00:00:54.230
all found themselves struck down by the disease that Feld empires

14
00:00:54.620 --> 00:00:59.240
and denials hated cities until one day it stopped in the mid

15
00:00:59.241 --> 00:01:00.140
20th century,

16
00:01:00.141 --> 00:01:04.430
a pushed by the world health organization saw smallpox become the first disease

17
00:01:04.670 --> 00:01:06.920
to ever be completely eradicated.

18
00:01:07.040 --> 00:01:10.730
The last natural case was recorded in 1977.

19
00:01:10.820 --> 00:01:14.750
After thousands of years of suffering, humanity was finally free,

20
00:01:14.930 --> 00:01:19.010
but what was this virus? We drove to extinction. Where did it come from?

21
00:01:19.011 --> 00:01:21.650
And how did it affect the story of humanity? Well,

22
00:01:21.651 --> 00:01:26.570
today we're diving into the life of one of history's great plagues and how

23
00:01:26.571 --> 00:01:28.760
it created our modern world.

24
00:01:34.790 --> 00:01:34.880
<v 1>[Inaudible].</v>

25
00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:37.940
<v 0>Of all the nasty viruses that have afflicted mankind.</v>

26
00:01:38.120 --> 00:01:41.720
Few have been as nasty as smallpox once inhaled into your system,

27
00:01:41.721 --> 00:01:43.610
it stays hidden for around 12 days,

28
00:01:43.611 --> 00:01:47.630
almost like an army Lang the perfect ambush in that time,

29
00:01:47.631 --> 00:01:51.080
your life carries on as normal. You go to work, hanging out with friends,

30
00:01:51.081 --> 00:01:56.060
never knowing that your death warrant has already been signed. Then on day 13,

31
00:01:56.061 --> 00:02:00.200
it happens. The first symptoms are headaches, back pain, chills, vomiting.

32
00:02:00.470 --> 00:02:04.520
At first you pray that you're mistaken, that it's just a bad dose of the flu,

33
00:02:04.850 --> 00:02:06.470
but as the 17th day approaches,

34
00:02:06.471 --> 00:02:10.100
you discovered the truth will start to appear inside your throat.

35
00:02:10.130 --> 00:02:14.480
Then spread out like an army marching across your skin. Every inch of you,

36
00:02:14.481 --> 00:02:16.970
this army touches breaks out and hard.

37
00:02:17.270 --> 00:02:20.420
Pus filled lumps with an indentation in the middle after that.

38
00:02:20.500 --> 00:02:21.950
So you're on a roller coaster of pain,

39
00:02:22.070 --> 00:02:25.350
depending on which version of the virus you've caught very early,

40
00:02:25.351 --> 00:02:29.600
a minor or very early major. Your chances of death could be any way from a myth.

41
00:02:29.630 --> 00:02:34.310
3% to a staggering 30 surviving might be even

42
00:02:34.311 --> 00:02:37.400
worse. Once smallpox has finished ravaging your system,

43
00:02:37.401 --> 00:02:38.600
the pastels on your face,

44
00:02:38.601 --> 00:02:43.400
feet and hands scab over and fall off leaving behind hideous pitted scars that

45
00:02:43.401 --> 00:02:47.090
will stay with you for the rest of your life. Even once you recover,

46
00:02:47.420 --> 00:02:51.530
you may be left blinds and in fertile sounds pretty awful, right?

47
00:02:51.740 --> 00:02:56.510
Almost as if a writer with a particularly twisted imagination sat down and tried

48
00:02:56.690 --> 00:03:00.520
to dream up the nastiest science fiction disease they could think of,

49
00:03:00.700 --> 00:03:02.500
but smallpox isn't science fiction.

50
00:03:02.620 --> 00:03:06.700
It existed during the lifetime of anyone older than their mid forties.

51
00:03:06.910 --> 00:03:09.940
And prior to that, it had been around for centuries.

52
00:03:10.060 --> 00:03:12.400
The exact origins of smallpox are still a mystery.

53
00:03:12.520 --> 00:03:16.060
Some have suggested it may date back to his followers, 10,000 BC.

54
00:03:16.061 --> 00:03:20.470
When the neolithic revolution brought us into sustained contact with livestock.

55
00:03:20.590 --> 00:03:23.710
On the other hand, his research in 2016 concluded this.

56
00:03:23.980 --> 00:03:28.030
It may have appeared as late as the 16th century a D for this video though,

57
00:03:28.031 --> 00:03:30.430
we're just going to go with the majority opinion, which says,

58
00:03:30.610 --> 00:03:34.780
all we know is that smallpox had first appeared by 1570 BC.

59
00:03:34.810 --> 00:03:39.760
That's because 15 to 70 BC is the stop date of Egypt's new kingdom and a handful

60
00:03:39.761 --> 00:03:43.630
of mummies from the era. Still show telltale signs of infection.

61
00:03:43.660 --> 00:03:47.650
This includes Ramesses the fifth who had a swath of long dead pastorals dried

62
00:03:47.651 --> 00:03:48.550
out on his cheeks,

63
00:03:48.580 --> 00:03:52.300
likely the first known instances of smallpox killing a leader,

64
00:03:52.390 --> 00:03:55.210
not the most victims were anybody you'd have heard about,

65
00:03:55.360 --> 00:03:57.160
although smallpox afflicted adults,

66
00:03:57.161 --> 00:04:00.610
the majority of those that killed with children and the majority of those were

67
00:04:00.611 --> 00:04:04.870
kids who lived in cramped quarters, where the virus could spread and spread.

68
00:04:05.230 --> 00:04:05.950
It did,

69
00:04:05.950 --> 00:04:09.670
although smallpox was relatively non-contagious compared to stuff like measles.

70
00:04:09.850 --> 00:04:12.460
Once it got hold, it really got hold.

71
00:04:12.580 --> 00:04:16.120
There's a 14th century hits on into tablet describing what may be the disease

72
00:04:16.121 --> 00:04:20.620
sweeping that lands the pandemic raged for 20 years and carried off two rulers

73
00:04:20.800 --> 00:04:23.350
before finally fading. But if that sounds bad,

74
00:04:23.680 --> 00:04:28.630
just know that is far worse to come across the history of Eurasia,

75
00:04:28.870 --> 00:04:31.990
there would be barely a single empire that didn't come into contact with

76
00:04:31.991 --> 00:04:34.900
smallpox at some point or another. In some cases,

77
00:04:34.901 --> 00:04:39.280
this brief brush would be enough to bring their civilization crashing down.

78
00:04:45.540 --> 00:04:45.640
<v 1>[Inaudible].</v>

79
00:04:45.640 --> 00:04:48.360
<v 0>If you ever find yourself in the possession of a time machine,</v>

80
00:04:48.540 --> 00:04:50.760
be sure to follow the following advice,

81
00:04:50.790 --> 00:04:55.650
whatever you do do not set the controls for 430 BC Athens last

82
00:04:55.651 --> 00:05:00.180
because Athens in four 30 BC was in the grip of a pandemic that would make

83
00:05:00.660 --> 00:05:04.650
COVID 19 look like an outbreak of rainbows and puppies.

84
00:05:04.680 --> 00:05:07.260
During the second year of the Peloponnesian war,

85
00:05:07.261 --> 00:05:11.250
a disease arrived in the port of Piraeus known as the plague of Athens.

86
00:05:11.340 --> 00:05:15.210
It killed around a third of the population in horrifying fashion.

87
00:05:15.330 --> 00:05:19.050
The historian lucidity, who himself contracted the virus, described it,

88
00:05:19.051 --> 00:05:22.980
thus violent heaps in the head, redness and inflammation of the eyes,

89
00:05:23.010 --> 00:05:24.210
throat and tongue quickly.

90
00:05:24.240 --> 00:05:27.510
Suffused with blood breath became unnatural and fetish,

91
00:05:27.630 --> 00:05:32.190
sneezing and hoarseness violent cough, vomiting, retching, violent convulsions,

92
00:05:32.340 --> 00:05:33.510
the body externally,

93
00:05:33.540 --> 00:05:38.010
not so hot to the touch nor yet to pale and livid color inkling to read breaking

94
00:05:38.011 --> 00:05:42.330
out in pastels and offices, pastels and offices probably sounding familiar.

95
00:05:42.390 --> 00:05:44.640
We don't actually know what caused the plague of Athens,

96
00:05:44.641 --> 00:05:48.330
but smallpox is a major contender. Other possible diseases include measles.

97
00:05:48.331 --> 00:05:51.660
And the bubonic plague smallpox becomes an even more likely contender.

98
00:05:51.661 --> 00:05:55.020
When you hear that some survivors were left blind, whatever it was,

99
00:05:55.021 --> 00:05:57.180
the plague left Athens badly weakened.

100
00:05:57.350 --> 00:06:01.760
They carried off the great lead apparently and contributed to Athens ultimately

101
00:06:01.790 --> 00:06:03.470
losing the Peloponnesian war.

102
00:06:03.590 --> 00:06:06.530
But while the jury is out on whether smallpox was the culprit,

103
00:06:06.560 --> 00:06:10.460
the same copy said of one of the ancient worlds, other great plagues,

104
00:06:10.520 --> 00:06:13.070
the ends of nine plague landed nearly at six centuries.

105
00:06:13.071 --> 00:06:16.670
After the plague of Athens arriving in ancient Rome, around 165,

106
00:06:16.671 --> 00:06:20.870
a D in all likelihood, it was brought from China. Traveling along the silk road,

107
00:06:20.871 --> 00:06:22.700
carried into Europe by the very traders,

108
00:06:22.701 --> 00:06:26.360
trying to escape it where the plague of Athens would kill tens of thousands.

109
00:06:26.361 --> 00:06:26.780
Though,

110
00:06:26.780 --> 00:06:30.830
the answer nine plague would kill millions two weeks off to contact with an

111
00:06:30.831 --> 00:06:34.850
infected person. The victims would come down with fevers, diarrhea, vomiting,

112
00:06:35.030 --> 00:06:38.360
and coughing shortly after that, their skin erupted in Hills,

113
00:06:38.361 --> 00:06:41.990
which would soon form scabs that covered nearly the entire skin.

114
00:06:42.200 --> 00:06:44.810
And if you think that sounds gross, wait till he heard this,

115
00:06:44.960 --> 00:06:49.310
the worst effected would even cough up scabs that had been formed inside their

116
00:06:49.311 --> 00:06:52.220
bodies. Not nice at the plagues height.

117
00:06:52.221 --> 00:06:55.280
Over 2000 people were dying each day in the eternal city,

118
00:06:55.490 --> 00:06:58.730
a number that eventually included emperor Marcus Aurelius.

119
00:06:58.790 --> 00:07:03.260
The final death toll was a staggering 3.5 to 7 million.

120
00:07:03.410 --> 00:07:06.530
It may have contributed to the militaries inability to defend rooms,

121
00:07:06.550 --> 00:07:11.540
German border. Naturally people had all sorts of wacky theories about it scores.

122
00:07:11.870 --> 00:07:15.080
Some said a Roman general open day forbid and door while sacking.

123
00:07:15.081 --> 00:07:16.670
Solutia releasing the plague.

124
00:07:16.880 --> 00:07:21.680
Others that a soldier opened a casket and Babylon's tumble and the God sent him

125
00:07:21.710 --> 00:07:22.970
the plague as a punishment.

126
00:07:23.240 --> 00:07:26.450
It's only with hindsight that we can call the ans unknown plague.

127
00:07:26.630 --> 00:07:31.490
What it most likely was smallpox while smallpox devastated Eurasia as early.

128
00:07:31.670 --> 00:07:35.780
And it also gave them a strange kind of gift with each new pandemic,

129
00:07:35.781 --> 00:07:40.100
Eurasian resistance to the parks grew while it might not sound so great.

130
00:07:40.190 --> 00:07:42.800
It would soon become a very valuable asset.

131
00:07:42.950 --> 00:07:46.010
Some 1,400 years after the end of nine plague,

132
00:07:46.160 --> 00:07:50.240
a group of Europeans would arrive on a continent that had never seen smallpox

133
00:07:50.241 --> 00:07:50.810
before.

134
00:07:50.810 --> 00:07:54.830
It would be thanks to this tiny virus that they soon became the continence mask.

135
00:08:01.600 --> 00:08:01.630
<v 2>[Inaudible].</v>

136
00:08:01.630 --> 00:08:02.560
<v 0>The next few centuries.</v>

137
00:08:02.710 --> 00:08:07.210
We're an era of migration for smallpox at some points before the sixth century,

138
00:08:07.211 --> 00:08:11.620
the virus got its tendrils into India and China where cults devoted to smallpox

139
00:08:12.040 --> 00:08:14.050
data is sprang up by the sixth century.

140
00:08:14.051 --> 00:08:18.010
It had reached Japan alongside the weird cross-cultural belief that it could be

141
00:08:18.011 --> 00:08:20.860
stopped by the color red come. The 11th century,

142
00:08:20.861 --> 00:08:24.730
the crusade spread the disease far and wide afflicting corners of Europe that

143
00:08:24.970 --> 00:08:26.170
had never been hit before.

144
00:08:26.230 --> 00:08:29.620
Not long after Portuguese colonists were introducing it to parts of Africa,

145
00:08:29.650 --> 00:08:33.130
making small box a truly global scourge, but the biggest,

146
00:08:33.160 --> 00:08:37.360
most dramatic migration came in the early 16th century a decade or so after

147
00:08:37.361 --> 00:08:41.740
Columbus discovered it smallpox finally set foot in the new Wells. By now,

148
00:08:41.741 --> 00:08:45.820
it was more in Europe than even the black death yet it was destined to give the

149
00:08:45.821 --> 00:08:48.970
Europeans a bit of a helping hands in 15, 20,

150
00:08:49.060 --> 00:08:53.230
or ship carrying someone infected with smallpox often said to be a slave landed

151
00:08:53.231 --> 00:08:54.310
on the shores of Mexico.

152
00:08:54.370 --> 00:08:58.860
This was the of honing Cortez's expedition into Misa America's Heartland

153
00:08:59.100 --> 00:09:00.540
into the Aztec and Bob,

154
00:09:00.660 --> 00:09:03.960
as the Europeans marched on the POCs trailed in their wake.

155
00:09:04.050 --> 00:09:07.890
It wasn't long before it was wreaking havoc. Smallpox was unlike anything.

156
00:09:07.891 --> 00:09:11.490
The indigenous people's immune systems had ever encountered before it's

157
00:09:12.240 --> 00:09:15.720
overwhelmed them. It devastated them. If smallpox was a nightmare for Europe,

158
00:09:15.721 --> 00:09:20.670
then for Misa America, it was nothing short of the apocalypse that October 15,

159
00:09:20.671 --> 00:09:22.170
20 smallpox ravage,

160
00:09:22.190 --> 00:09:26.790
the great Aztec capital of tenor Shipman up to 40% of the population died

161
00:09:27.120 --> 00:09:29.970
as the NSX recorded. As the plague lasted for 70 days,

162
00:09:29.971 --> 00:09:33.810
striking everywhere in the city and killing a vast number of our people.

163
00:09:34.260 --> 00:09:36.750
Souls erupted on our faces. Our breasts saw bellies.

164
00:09:36.900 --> 00:09:39.690
We were covered with agonizing souls from head to foot.

165
00:09:39.750 --> 00:09:44.070
The Europeans were more detached as the Indians did not know the remedy of the

166
00:09:44.071 --> 00:09:48.990
disease wrote one of quarters as team. They died in heaps like bedbugs.

167
00:09:49.140 --> 00:09:50.040
However, you look at it.

168
00:09:50.130 --> 00:09:54.690
Smallpox was devastating for the Aztecs when Cortez conquered Teno Chitlin in

169
00:09:54.691 --> 00:09:55.680
1521,

170
00:09:55.830 --> 00:09:59.880
it was in large part because European germs had already killed so many of its

171
00:09:59.881 --> 00:10:00.570
citizens,

172
00:10:00.570 --> 00:10:04.890
nor would the Aztec EMBA be the only one torn down by the virus in the Andes.

173
00:10:04.891 --> 00:10:07.920
Smallpox arrived ahead of the Europeans in 1528,

174
00:10:07.950 --> 00:10:10.860
the incunabula Wayne and Kropach was carried off by us.

175
00:10:11.370 --> 00:10:13.350
His death sparked a civil war between his two,

176
00:10:13.351 --> 00:10:16.500
as that helped spread smallpox across the Inca lands.

177
00:10:16.590 --> 00:10:20.910
In some places it killed 65 to 90% of the population.

178
00:10:21.180 --> 00:10:24.330
By the time Francisco Pizarro arrived in 1532,

179
00:10:24.540 --> 00:10:29.100
the empire was barely clinging on bizarro, just delivered the killing blow,

180
00:10:29.400 --> 00:10:33.330
but it wasn't just in South America that smallpox made its presence felt not

181
00:10:33.360 --> 00:10:36.360
just below the border where it changed history up in the North.

182
00:10:36.390 --> 00:10:39.900
The colonists would even find a despicable use for it.

183
00:10:39.990 --> 00:10:41.730
But just before we get into what I'm in there,

184
00:10:41.880 --> 00:10:45.150
I do want to take a moment to tell you about today's sponsor dollar shave club.

185
00:10:45.151 --> 00:10:48.750
Now dollar shave club covers all of your grooming needs, shower,

186
00:10:48.810 --> 00:10:52.370
oral care deodorants. Then of course, and most of them importantly shaving.

187
00:10:52.371 --> 00:10:55.100
Now I don't shave my bed. Yeah. I can see that. Yeah,

188
00:10:55.160 --> 00:10:59.930
but I do shave my head and that experience has become a lot better since I

189
00:10:59.931 --> 00:11:03.680
switched to dollar shave club and they're high quality blades and also the high

190
00:11:03.681 --> 00:11:07.190
quality handled, like feeling this thing right now, this is fairly hefty.

191
00:11:07.191 --> 00:11:08.630
I mean, it's got a great way to it.

192
00:11:08.810 --> 00:11:12.200
Dollar shave club sent me the ultimate shave starters that let me run you

193
00:11:12.201 --> 00:11:15.800
through what I got. First of all, of course, there's the prep scrub.

194
00:11:16.010 --> 00:11:20.150
You slap that on your face and you scrub your face down. Well,

195
00:11:20.380 --> 00:11:23.320
I've slap it on my heads and I scrubbed my head down. Uh,

196
00:11:23.321 --> 00:11:25.880
and then you put on the shave butter, that's part two,

197
00:11:26.180 --> 00:11:28.220
there's three parts you put on this shape, butter.

198
00:11:28.280 --> 00:11:33.020
Then use this executive six blade version of bear a the

199
00:11:33.500 --> 00:11:35.030
starter stack, which is what I'd recommend you get.

200
00:11:35.330 --> 00:11:38.090
And then afterwards you pop on post shaved you,

201
00:11:38.091 --> 00:11:39.500
and I've said it before in these ads.

202
00:11:39.830 --> 00:11:43.250
This is my favorite thing because my head it's a little bit dry after a shave.

203
00:11:43.700 --> 00:11:45.710
And I know when I used to shave my face as well,

204
00:11:46.040 --> 00:11:48.680
also used to get a little bit dry there. So this place has shaved you.

205
00:11:49.010 --> 00:11:51.980
This is where it's at, slap that on and you're all good.

206
00:11:52.130 --> 00:11:56.410
So what do you need to visit dollar shave club.com forward slash biographics get

207
00:11:56.411 --> 00:11:59.740
the ultimate shave starter set, but just $5 also.

208
00:11:59.860 --> 00:12:02.890
Why not round out your grooming routine by adding some of the other high quality

209
00:12:02.891 --> 00:12:03.940
products after that,

210
00:12:04.120 --> 00:12:07.900
the restock box ships full size products at their regular price. And, uh,

211
00:12:08.350 --> 00:12:09.940
let's get back to the video shop. Wait,

212
00:12:09.941 --> 00:12:13.300
because it's about to get fairly horrific. If it hasn't been horrific enough.

213
00:12:20.040 --> 00:12:20.130
<v 1>[Inaudible].</v>

214
00:12:20.130 --> 00:12:21.220
<v 0>Contrary to what you may have heard.</v>

215
00:12:21.250 --> 00:12:25.020
Smallpox wasn't deliberately introduced into the native American population by

216
00:12:25.021 --> 00:12:26.100
colonists. In fact,

217
00:12:26.310 --> 00:12:30.330
it had already swept the America's like wildfire passing from indigenous group

218
00:12:30.331 --> 00:12:31.320
to indigenous group,

219
00:12:31.350 --> 00:12:36.060
like a really crappy game of pass the parcel where every single prize is over

220
00:12:36.120 --> 00:12:40.230
half your population dying horribly the year before the Mayflower arrived an

221
00:12:40.231 --> 00:12:44.880
epidemic. And what is now new England killed up to 90% of the locals yet.

222
00:12:44.910 --> 00:12:47.910
Even if the colonists weren't standing outside their cabins,

223
00:12:47.940 --> 00:12:52.590
cheerfully handing out infected blankets, they were still on the boxes side.

224
00:12:52.740 --> 00:12:55.320
When an outbreak hit Massachusetts in 1633,

225
00:12:55.321 --> 00:12:59.760
plenty of Puritans believed the grim native death toll was a gift from.

226
00:12:59.910 --> 00:13:00.743
<v 1>God.</v>

227
00:13:05.250 --> 00:13:07.830
<v 0>A moment and discuss those blankets.</v>

228
00:13:08.130 --> 00:13:10.050
There's a good chance you picked on this video.

229
00:13:10.051 --> 00:13:13.950
I expect it to hit tales of Calvinists, deliberately giving smallpox to natives.

230
00:13:14.130 --> 00:13:18.540
It's one of the iconic images in the giant picture book titled how the native

231
00:13:18.541 --> 00:13:22.230
Americans got screwed over despite its vast reputation though,

232
00:13:22.290 --> 00:13:26.880
this scene only played out a single time. The year was 1763,

233
00:13:27.030 --> 00:13:30.840
the last year of the French and Indian war that spring Shawnee and Mingo

234
00:13:30.841 --> 00:13:35.460
warriors lead siege to Fort Pitt in what is now Pittsburgh smallpox was already

235
00:13:35.880 --> 00:13:39.090
inside the Fort and the commander wrote to his superiors worrying that it would

236
00:13:39.091 --> 00:13:41.280
spread. So his superior wrote back saying,

237
00:13:41.340 --> 00:13:44.970
why let all that good smallpox go to waste across two letters.

238
00:13:45.000 --> 00:13:48.390
So Jeffrey Amhurst commander in chief of the British forces in North America

239
00:13:48.391 --> 00:13:49.050
wrote,

240
00:13:49.050 --> 00:13:53.550
could it not be contrived to send the smallpox among those disaffected tribes of

241
00:13:53.551 --> 00:13:55.470
Indians? We must on this occasion,

242
00:13:55.471 --> 00:13:58.380
use every stratagem in our power to reduce them,

243
00:13:58.560 --> 00:14:03.450
try every other method that can serve to extubate this ex scrubble sick race.

244
00:14:03.660 --> 00:14:07.860
Interestingly, we don't know if Amherst's instructions were actually followed.

245
00:14:08.070 --> 00:14:10.640
What we do know is that a militia captain not before two,

246
00:14:10.800 --> 00:14:14.310
one William Trent had already tried giving diplomats from the attacking tribes,

247
00:14:14.311 --> 00:14:17.700
a couple of blankets infected with the parks. And that was it.

248
00:14:17.940 --> 00:14:21.210
The one documented time that colonists tried to deliberately give native

249
00:14:21.211 --> 00:14:23.670
American smallpox to be brutally honest though,

250
00:14:23.700 --> 00:14:27.810
while a obviously despicable thing to do it probably didn't make a difference.

251
00:14:27.990 --> 00:14:30.450
Smallpox was already in the native American population.

252
00:14:30.630 --> 00:14:33.180
There were already major outbreaks happening around Fort Pierce.

253
00:14:33.360 --> 00:14:37.470
The moment European germs touched America's shores and natives were already

254
00:14:38.010 --> 00:14:41.190
doomed, but while it had been Europeans, you spread smallpox to the new world.

255
00:14:41.370 --> 00:14:45.330
It would also be a European who finally stopped it in its tracks because it's

256
00:14:45.331 --> 00:14:46.380
time to meet Edward Jenner.

257
00:14:46.530 --> 00:14:47.363
<v 1>Right?</v>

258
00:14:52.720 --> 00:14:56.710
<v 0>By the time the 18th century rolls around smallpox had become just a gross fact</v>

259
00:14:56.711 --> 00:14:59.680
of life in Europe alone and killed 400,000 people a year,

260
00:14:59.681 --> 00:15:03.160
including some of the very top of society. Peter, the second of Russia, Mary,

261
00:15:03.170 --> 00:15:05.230
the second thing Linds Louis, the 15th of France,

262
00:15:05.590 --> 00:15:09.400
rural carried away by the disease. It had also acquired its name smallpox,

263
00:15:09.430 --> 00:15:13.330
which was meant to differentiate it from the great parks or what would now call

264
00:15:13.331 --> 00:15:15.520
syphilis yet. Even as Europe suffered,

265
00:15:15.580 --> 00:15:19.300
other continents were already bringing smallpox under control variolation is

266
00:15:19.301 --> 00:15:20.890
thought to a started in 10th century,

267
00:15:20.891 --> 00:15:23.980
China and India before spreading West into the ultimate empire.

268
00:15:24.220 --> 00:15:27.970
The process was as low-tech as it was barf inducing,

269
00:15:28.090 --> 00:15:30.970
basically you'd take the positive. Someone infected with smallpox.

270
00:15:30.971 --> 00:15:33.460
Then make a load of cups in the arm of a healthy person.

271
00:15:33.461 --> 00:15:36.730
And inside the pasta inside them, a couple of weeks later,

272
00:15:36.731 --> 00:15:40.890
a healthy person would come down with a mild case of smallpox recover and to

273
00:15:40.891 --> 00:15:42.100
have a lifelong immunity.

274
00:15:42.190 --> 00:15:46.000
Broadly speaking this wax while the normal risk of death from small box was

275
00:15:46.001 --> 00:15:50.260
around 30% only around 0.5% died from variolation.

276
00:15:50.320 --> 00:15:54.010
But this method wasn't perfect. Although very elated people rarely died.

277
00:15:54.130 --> 00:15:55.270
They were infectious.

278
00:15:55.300 --> 00:15:58.720
This could easily pass on the much more serious case to those who were around

279
00:15:58.721 --> 00:15:59.050
them.

280
00:15:59.050 --> 00:16:02.860
It also required you to have a constant supply of patients with smallpox whose

281
00:16:03.040 --> 00:16:05.590
pass you could take and insert into healthy people.

282
00:16:05.680 --> 00:16:09.760
So it was great as variolation was compared to, you know, dying of smallpox,

283
00:16:09.790 --> 00:16:11.080
it could still be improved.

284
00:16:11.230 --> 00:16:13.030
<v 3>Luckily someone was about to do.</v>

285
00:16:13.030 --> 00:16:13.863
<v 0>Just that.</v>

286
00:16:13.870 --> 00:16:18.340
Edward Jenner was a surgeon living in Gloucestershire bucolic slice of England's

287
00:16:18.341 --> 00:16:20.020
famed for its dairy industry.

288
00:16:20.080 --> 00:16:24.340
It was also famed for its cowpox virus that tended to affect the hands of

289
00:16:24.341 --> 00:16:27.520
milkmaids leaving their fingers covered in unsightly pastels.

290
00:16:27.700 --> 00:16:28.720
But here's the thing,

291
00:16:28.780 --> 00:16:33.220
none of those cowpox infected milkmaids ever seemed to catch smallpox.

292
00:16:33.310 --> 00:16:36.460
The popular version of this story is that Jenna was the first person to notice

293
00:16:36.461 --> 00:16:38.530
this, but that's not actually true.

294
00:16:38.620 --> 00:16:41.920
Pretty much all the locals were aware that cowpox meant no smallpox,

295
00:16:42.100 --> 00:16:46.240
a farmer who had Benjamin Jesse had even used cowpox material to deliberately

296
00:16:46.241 --> 00:16:49.390
inoculate his sons against ballparks in 1774.

297
00:16:49.540 --> 00:16:52.930
But then he forgot to tell anyone about this world changing breakthrough.

298
00:16:52.960 --> 00:16:57.010
So it was left to Jenna to discover it independently. In 1796,

299
00:16:57.040 --> 00:17:00.670
Jenna asked a family. He knew if he could borrow that eight-year-old son,

300
00:17:00.970 --> 00:17:01.870
James Phipps,

301
00:17:01.960 --> 00:17:06.520
he then took some cowpox POS from a milkmaid named Sarah Nelms and inserted it

302
00:17:06.580 --> 00:17:07.780
into Phipps's skin.

303
00:17:07.900 --> 00:17:11.770
After Phipps had recovered from a mild case of cowpox Jenna then exposed the boy

304
00:17:11.800 --> 00:17:16.120
to smallpox repeatedly, but fortunately nothing happened to him,

305
00:17:16.210 --> 00:17:18.940
James Phipps. He was immune to the virus today.

306
00:17:18.941 --> 00:17:20.920
Hearing that story mostly makes us think of.

307
00:17:21.130 --> 00:17:25.150
<v 3>Holy crap. That dude tried to literally give a child smallpox.</v>

308
00:17:25.480 --> 00:17:26.350
What the hell? Okay.

309
00:17:27.100 --> 00:17:29.500
<v 0>Times, but make no mistake. This was a breakthrough,</v>

310
00:17:29.590 --> 00:17:32.740
the variolation to shame Jenna named his new technique,

311
00:17:32.800 --> 00:17:37.270
vaccination off to the Latin for cow belly hoodie coins. The term.

312
00:17:37.450 --> 00:17:40.300
Then the first anti-vaxxers came crawling out of the woodwork.

313
00:17:40.540 --> 00:17:43.810
There all society told Jenna he shouldn't promulgate some shady wild idea.

314
00:17:43.990 --> 00:17:46.060
If he valued his reputation. Yes,

315
00:17:46.750 --> 00:17:50.130
promulgates Jenna did in his 1798 treatise on vaccination.

316
00:17:50.131 --> 00:17:52.500
He declined the annihilation of the smallpox.

317
00:17:52.501 --> 00:17:57.090
The most dreadful scourge of the human species must be the final results of this

318
00:17:57.091 --> 00:18:01.770
practice. His words landed like a bomb. Napoleon calls vaccination.

319
00:18:01.800 --> 00:18:03.240
The greatest gift of all time.

320
00:18:03.270 --> 00:18:08.220
Thomas Jefferson told Jenna mankind's can never forget that you have lived by

321
00:18:08.221 --> 00:18:12.270
1810, both Bavaria and Denmark had made vaccination mandatory in the following

322
00:18:12.271 --> 00:18:15.000
decades. The vaccination slowly spread around the globe,

323
00:18:15.030 --> 00:18:18.540
but Jenna's dream of a world without smallpox would never materialize.

324
00:18:18.750 --> 00:18:23.520
Even as cases plunged the virus still stubbornly clung on still ruins

325
00:18:23.521 --> 00:18:28.050
lives. Even as the 20th century reached its midpoint, but not for much.

326
00:18:34.940 --> 00:18:36.230
<v 1>By the beginning of the cold war.</v>

327
00:18:36.380 --> 00:18:39.140
<v 0>I watch all of the West had already defeated smallpox.</v>

328
00:18:39.260 --> 00:18:42.350
The last U S case was in 1949, three years later,

329
00:18:42.351 --> 00:18:46.430
North America was declared smallpox free a year after that Europe followed suit.

330
00:18:46.700 --> 00:18:49.250
But even as parts of the world defeated the virus,

331
00:18:49.310 --> 00:18:53.690
others were still left in its lethal grip. As late as 1967,

332
00:18:53.691 --> 00:18:57.860
there were still some 10 to 15 million smallpox cases globally with parts of

333
00:18:57.861 --> 00:19:00.830
Latin America, Africa and Asia hit badly.

334
00:19:00.980 --> 00:19:04.910
But 1967 was also smallpox as last hurrah that same year,

335
00:19:04.940 --> 00:19:06.290
the world health organization,

336
00:19:06.291 --> 00:19:09.860
or who announced a plan to eradicate it completely.

337
00:19:10.010 --> 00:19:12.410
It was an immediate unqualified success.

338
00:19:12.470 --> 00:19:17.420
The speed at which smallpox was brought to heel seems dizzying today by 1971,

339
00:19:17.421 --> 00:19:19.400
just four years after the program began,

340
00:19:19.550 --> 00:19:21.560
it had been eradicated in Latin America.

341
00:19:21.680 --> 00:19:25.460
This success was due to a new technique that emphasized contact tracing and mass

342
00:19:25.461 --> 00:19:30.170
vaccination and new tank that included a freeze dried heat stable virus to use

343
00:19:30.171 --> 00:19:32.450
in vaccinations in late 1975,

344
00:19:32.570 --> 00:19:36.680
the final case was reported in Asia Rahima Banu was a three-year-old girl living

345
00:19:36.681 --> 00:19:39.530
in Bangladesh. When she contracted Verrier to major, uh,

346
00:19:39.531 --> 00:19:41.690
locally roles reported her to the who,

347
00:19:41.691 --> 00:19:46.100
who responded with a massive lockdown Rahima Banu was isolated at home under 24

348
00:19:46.250 --> 00:19:46.940
hour surveillance.

349
00:19:46.940 --> 00:19:51.800
Every household within 2.5 kilometers was mass vaccinated and every public space

350
00:19:51.801 --> 00:19:55.730
within eight kilometers was disinfected. It sounds like overkill,

351
00:19:56.030 --> 00:19:59.930
but it worked went down. He recovered Verio to major was dead in the wind.

352
00:20:00.080 --> 00:20:02.960
Two years later, very old minor struck for the last time.

353
00:20:03.200 --> 00:20:07.160
And Merl Marlon was a hospital worker in Somalia tasked with looking after

354
00:20:07.161 --> 00:20:11.270
Africa's lost smallpox patients on October the 22nd, 1977,

355
00:20:11.271 --> 00:20:13.760
he himself came down with a disease and was quarantined.

356
00:20:14.030 --> 00:20:17.690
He recovered that November and that was it for smallpox in Africa.

357
00:20:17.810 --> 00:20:20.150
But the last day of a case of smallpox in human history,

358
00:20:20.151 --> 00:20:23.690
it wouldn't happen and rural Bangladesh all out in Somalia.

359
00:20:23.990 --> 00:20:28.430
It would happen in England. In the summer of 1978 hospital photographer,

360
00:20:28.460 --> 00:20:31.880
Janet Parker began suffering a headache and bad muscle pain.

361
00:20:31.940 --> 00:20:34.280
Shortly after red welts appeared across our body.

362
00:20:34.550 --> 00:20:37.820
Stumped doctors tried all sorts of diagnoses.

363
00:20:37.940 --> 00:20:41.120
It wasn't until she had been ill for two weeks that someone realized it was

364
00:20:41.121 --> 00:20:45.470
smallpox by then. It was too late on September the 11th, 1978.

365
00:20:45.471 --> 00:20:49.450
Janet Parker became the last person history to die from smallpox.

366
00:20:49.570 --> 00:20:51.940
Although smallpox wouldn't kill anyone else in Birmingham,

367
00:20:51.941 --> 00:20:54.130
the tragedy still claimed additional victims.

368
00:20:54.370 --> 00:20:57.820
Design of Parker covered in pastels caused a father to have a fatal heart

369
00:20:57.821 --> 00:20:58.210
attack.

370
00:20:58.210 --> 00:21:01.420
When the source of the outbreak was traced to a lab in the university building

371
00:21:01.750 --> 00:21:05.680
Parker worked and the head of the microbiology department slit his own throat.

372
00:21:05.920 --> 00:21:07.900
Finally, on may the eighth, 1980,

373
00:21:07.930 --> 00:21:12.850
the who declared the planet smallpox free after millennia of terror.

374
00:21:12.970 --> 00:21:15.970
Humanity's worst plague had been defeated. Do they?

375
00:21:15.980 --> 00:21:19.330
The disease exists only in two Catholic guarded labs,

376
00:21:19.570 --> 00:21:21.910
one in Atlanta and one in Siberia.

377
00:21:22.120 --> 00:21:25.470
Critics say these lost samples should be destroyed. Blessed.

378
00:21:25.471 --> 00:21:26.680
They escape into the wild,

379
00:21:26.800 --> 00:21:29.800
but supporters say the samples may one day become necessary.

380
00:21:29.801 --> 00:21:33.970
Like if a new strain of pox similar to smallpox evolves naturally,

381
00:21:34.120 --> 00:21:36.220
but rather than focusing on the negatives,

382
00:21:36.550 --> 00:21:39.310
let's end this video on a high note for three decades,

383
00:21:39.340 --> 00:21:41.740
smallpox stood alone as an anomaly.

384
00:21:41.800 --> 00:21:45.460
The one disease in history would ever managed to eradicate.

385
00:21:45.640 --> 00:21:49.150
Then in 2011, it was joined by another bovine.

386
00:21:49.450 --> 00:21:53.080
Reinder past was called the measles of cattle killing in telling our herds until

387
00:21:53.081 --> 00:21:54.850
we finally managed to stamp it out.

388
00:21:55.150 --> 00:21:59.050
And we like to think of it as sort of a late, thank you. Present to cows,

389
00:21:59.350 --> 00:22:03.490
the cow box and drawing the pest may not be the last currently Guinea worms,

390
00:22:03.491 --> 00:22:07.870
the target of an intense eradication campaign. When the program started in 1986,

391
00:22:07.871 --> 00:22:11.980
there were over 3.5 million cases a year in 2019,

392
00:22:12.190 --> 00:22:13.630
there were fewer than 60.

393
00:22:13.750 --> 00:22:17.950
The story of smallpox then is both a terrifying story of death and destruction,

394
00:22:18.340 --> 00:22:22.150
but also one of hope for the first time ever in the face of a disease,

395
00:22:22.151 --> 00:22:24.370
almost as old as civilization itself,

396
00:22:24.580 --> 00:22:28.000
human Collins was able to come together and not just combat it,

397
00:22:28.150 --> 00:22:31.540
but wipe his house barring an accident at one of those labs,

398
00:22:31.690 --> 00:22:36.610
no one will ever again know the pain of losing someone to smallpox while

399
00:22:36.611 --> 00:22:40.540
COVID-19 has showed us that disease is still something humanity has to fear.

400
00:22:40.870 --> 00:22:44.860
The eradication of smallpox is evidence that we really can overcome it.

401
00:22:45.100 --> 00:22:47.410
Given enough cooperation, given enough funding,

402
00:22:47.710 --> 00:22:51.790
it really is possible to rid the world of a mobster smallpox.

403
00:22:51.791 --> 00:22:55.510
His tail may have lost at millennia and cost millions of lives,

404
00:22:55.511 --> 00:23:00.250
but it is now finally over the last chapter has ended and this time

405
00:23:00.610 --> 00:23:04.960
happily that won't be a SQL. So I really hope you found that video.

Don't forget to support our sponsors who make these videos possible that today

408
00:23:12.491 --> 00:23:14.770
would be dollar shave club, who I will link to below.

409
00:23:15.190 --> 00:23:16.300
And thank you for watching.
