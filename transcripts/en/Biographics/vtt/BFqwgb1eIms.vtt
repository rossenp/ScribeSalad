00:00:00.070 --> 00:00:02.000
<v 0>Just before we get started with this one,</v>

2
00:00:02.001 --> 00:00:06.480
there are gonna be some Chinese pronunciations. I'm not Chinese. What?

3
00:00:07.020 --> 00:00:08.480
And I don't speak Chinese either.

4
00:00:08.920 --> 00:00:11.840
Although that would be called even this guy's name was a little bit tricky.

5
00:00:12.080 --> 00:00:14.760
I found a guy saying it on YouTube by no pronunciation dictionary.

6
00:00:14.761 --> 00:00:18.480
Didn't have this dude. I think it's Hong shoe tra I'm just gonna call him Hong,

7
00:00:18.481 --> 00:00:19.880
because that's what I can do.

8
00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:24.350
I apologize to anyone who's gonna get triggered because of this.

9
00:00:24.520 --> 00:00:25.353
Let's get into it.

10
00:00:31.370 --> 00:00:35.790
It is one of the bloodiest conflicts in human history in 1851,

11
00:00:35.791 --> 00:00:39.150
the typing rebellion exploded in Ching dynasty,

12
00:00:39.151 --> 00:00:42.100
China causing death on an UN unprecedented scale.

13
00:00:42.290 --> 00:00:46.900
Over 14 years of civil war and estimated 20 million people died more

14
00:00:47.130 --> 00:00:49.660
than they were killed in the whole of world war I,

15
00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:54.100
it was simply the deadliest war of the 19th century and it was all thanks to one

16
00:00:54.380 --> 00:00:59.060
man, Hong Shang, an ordinary village school master and aspiring civil servants.

17
00:00:59.220 --> 00:00:59.701
Hong was a nobody.

18
00:00:59.701 --> 00:01:04.330
When he fell into a trance one day in 1837 and emerged convinced that he was the

19
00:01:04.331 --> 00:01:07.170
son of God, quickly amassing a fighting force of 1 million.

20
00:01:07.270 --> 00:01:10.770
He marched against the ruling chin dynasty eventually conquering most of

21
00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:14.450
Southern China and establishing his own heavenly kingdom faded by Christian

22
00:01:14.451 --> 00:01:16.770
missionaries admired and loathed his home.

23
00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:21.930
This is the story of the anonymous man who almost became ruler of China and the

24
00:01:22.040 --> 00:01:26.360
unprecedented horrors that accompanied his rise and his fall

25
00:01:32.660 --> 00:01:33.600
In 1837,

26
00:01:33.640 --> 00:01:38.240
a young man in Guango got some bad news buff decades of studying had failed the

27
00:01:38.360 --> 00:01:42.830
entrance exam to the Chinese civil service for the third time broken by the

28
00:01:42.831 --> 00:01:45.350
news. The young man, he suffered a mental collapse.

29
00:01:45.530 --> 00:01:47.830
He fell into a delirium for days on end,

30
00:01:47.831 --> 00:01:50.990
experiencing strange and terrifying visions.

31
00:01:51.220 --> 00:01:53.350
This young man's name was Hong true track.

32
00:01:53.460 --> 00:01:57.150
When he finally recovered from his breakdown, China would never be the same.

33
00:01:57.151 --> 00:02:00.390
Again, born in 1814 in the Southern province of Guang.

34
00:02:00.870 --> 00:02:03.540
Hong had always felt that he was destined for greatness.

35
00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:04.620
The youngest of four children.

36
00:02:04.900 --> 00:02:08.060
He had been famous among his small farming community for his supernatural

37
00:02:08.061 --> 00:02:09.380
intelligence. In fact,

38
00:02:09.381 --> 00:02:12.460
Hong was so intelligent that his community had banded together to raise funds

39
00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:13.313
for his schooling.

40
00:02:13.340 --> 00:02:16.180
It was hoped that one day he would pass the civil service entrance exam.

41
00:02:16.280 --> 00:02:19.700
If it sounds odd to you that an entire village would care so much about one guy

42
00:02:19.701 --> 00:02:20.580
passing one exam.

43
00:02:20.580 --> 00:02:24.970
That's because you are fortunate enough not to live in early 19th century China

44
00:02:26.230 --> 00:02:29.170
in Hongs day, Chinese social classes were rigidly defined.

45
00:02:29.171 --> 00:02:31.050
According to Confucius's teachings.

46
00:02:31.190 --> 00:02:33.450
If you were born into a poor farming village,

47
00:02:33.830 --> 00:02:35.570
you died in a poor farming village.

48
00:02:36.030 --> 00:02:40.490
The only way out was that one exam passing. It meant not only glory for you,

49
00:02:40.510 --> 00:02:43.690
but also everyone else that you knew. So all of Hong's neighbors,

50
00:02:43.691 --> 00:02:46.000
they pick their hopes and their dreams on him.

51
00:02:46.230 --> 00:02:49.560
Aing an exam with a 1% pass rate.

52
00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:52.120
Maybe we're beginning to see why he had that mental breakdown. I mean,

53
00:02:52.121 --> 00:02:55.560
no pressure. Right? In 1827, after years of study the teenage song,

54
00:02:55.561 --> 00:02:59.720
he traveled to the nearby city of Guango to take the entrance exam for the first

55
00:02:59.750 --> 00:03:03.120
time. It was the moment his entire life had been building towards.

56
00:03:03.620 --> 00:03:06.520
So what happens? Well, ye guest did Hong.

57
00:03:06.820 --> 00:03:08.920
He flunked it pretty heart.

58
00:03:09.220 --> 00:03:13.160
Not only that he flunked the retake just a few years later by 1837,

59
00:03:13.161 --> 00:03:14.000
when nos story opened,

60
00:03:14.150 --> 00:03:18.710
Hong had traveled to Guangzhou to take the exam for the third time when he

61
00:03:18.711 --> 00:03:22.150
failed his mental collapse was so great that he lapsed into a coma where he was

62
00:03:22.151 --> 00:03:26.470
tormented by visions and what visions, Hong dreams of an old man with a beard,

63
00:03:26.471 --> 00:03:29.350
giving him a sword and telling him to slay all the demons in China,

64
00:03:29.550 --> 00:03:32.910
a middle aged man then instructed him in demon slaying before sending him back

65
00:03:32.911 --> 00:03:36.910
to earth. When Hong recovered, he was kind of like, whoa, that was pretty weird.

66
00:03:37.130 --> 00:03:40.540
And then he went straight back to his day job as a school master in his village.

67
00:03:40.800 --> 00:03:43.020
It wasn't until a chance, encount years later,

68
00:03:43.090 --> 00:03:47.620
this Hong came to realize the significance of these visions in 1843,

69
00:03:47.780 --> 00:03:52.220
the now 29 year old Hong was back home after failing the civil service exam for

70
00:03:52.260 --> 00:03:53.093
a fourth time,

71
00:03:53.360 --> 00:03:57.260
he was entertaining a cousin in his house when the cousin suddenly founded the

72
00:03:57.261 --> 00:04:00.650
bookshelf and asked Hong what on, uh, that was,

73
00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:04.610
that thing was Quang. Maybe on the pronunciation,

74
00:04:04.611 --> 00:04:07.690
on that one is a Christ pamphlet written by a Chinese convert.

75
00:04:07.691 --> 00:04:12.290
Someone had given it to Hong while he was failing one of his exams in Guango and

76
00:04:12.530 --> 00:04:14.890
had never even looked at it. But now his cousin had pointed it out.

77
00:04:14.891 --> 00:04:17.530
Hong gave the pamphlet a bit of a re what he found the,

78
00:04:17.810 --> 00:04:21.440
it absolutely blew his mind in the pamphlet's description of the Bible.

79
00:04:21.760 --> 00:04:24.840
Hong finally found the key to his wacky fever dream.

80
00:04:24.980 --> 00:04:27.360
The old man with the sword that had been God,

81
00:04:27.380 --> 00:04:29.040
the middle aged man that had been Jesus.

82
00:04:29.260 --> 00:04:34.000
The cool to rid the world of demons that had been God himself charging Hong with

83
00:04:34.180 --> 00:04:36.640
wiping out the Ching dynasty in China.

84
00:04:36.940 --> 00:04:40.480
By the time he finished reading the pamphlet, Hong had experienced a revelation.

85
00:04:41.010 --> 00:04:43.910
He was Jesus Christ's brother God's second son.

86
00:04:43.911 --> 00:04:47.590
And it was God's will that he overthrow the Ching and become Rooter of China.

87
00:04:53.890 --> 00:04:54.271
And look,

88
00:04:54.271 --> 00:04:57.230
if there's one thing I've learned in my many attempts to found a Simon whistle

89
00:04:57.231 --> 00:05:02.060
worshiping cult it's that people tend not to follow a rant Messiah unless

90
00:05:02.061 --> 00:05:03.260
they have a really good reason.

91
00:05:03.580 --> 00:05:06.180
Apparently YouTube videos is not enough on the surface.

92
00:05:06.600 --> 00:05:09.900
No one in Jing China had a good reason for following Hong the empire.

93
00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:13.220
It was stable and it was respected around the world. Not before long.

94
00:05:13.280 --> 00:05:17.980
The philosopher Aire had written one need not be obsessed with the merits of the

95
00:05:17.981 --> 00:05:21.810
Chinese to recognize that their empire is the best thing the world has ever

96
00:05:21.811 --> 00:05:24.050
seen, but scratch that shiny surface.

97
00:05:24.190 --> 00:05:28.530
And you'd discover a rot had set in that was nearly terminal.

98
00:05:28.790 --> 00:05:33.250
The ruling ch where ethnic minority mans you'd seize power in 60 44.

99
00:05:33.650 --> 00:05:35.890
Although they'd since run China like any other dynasty,

100
00:05:35.891 --> 00:05:39.530
they were despised by the hand majority they'd also oversee an enormous

101
00:05:39.531 --> 00:05:43.200
population, boom, that saw China's population over the 18th century.

102
00:05:43.350 --> 00:05:46.400
This was accompanied by no expansion in civil infrastructure.

103
00:05:46.420 --> 00:05:50.320
So no extra sewers roads or, you know, job prospects on top of that,

104
00:05:50.321 --> 00:05:53.520
the first opium war had just completed in 1842, winning Britain,

105
00:05:53.620 --> 00:05:54.720
not just Hong Kong,

106
00:05:54.980 --> 00:05:58.520
but also the right to do flood China with highly addictive drugs.

107
00:05:59.100 --> 00:06:02.160
By the time Hong declared himself, the second son of God,

108
00:06:02.170 --> 00:06:06.360
China was a country that was absolutely creaking at the seams.

109
00:06:06.500 --> 00:06:10.600
It was humiliated on the world stage and it was full of young angry men with no

110
00:06:10.840 --> 00:06:13.880
prospects for social betterments, marriage or employment.

111
00:06:13.990 --> 00:06:18.070
This was worse in the hacker class of which Hong was a member.

112
00:06:18.250 --> 00:06:20.470
Now we did mention this in the rush to get to Hong's story,

113
00:06:20.690 --> 00:06:24.230
but Hong's family came from an internal migrant class called the hacker.

114
00:06:24.240 --> 00:06:27.590
Their ancestors had settled in their villages some 800 years earlier,

115
00:06:27.650 --> 00:06:29.510
but they were still treated as outsiders,

116
00:06:29.710 --> 00:06:33.630
a humiliation that hacker across China faced every single day.

117
00:06:33.930 --> 00:06:38.820
Now please do remember the word hacker because it's going to be important. Okay.

118
00:06:38.840 --> 00:06:42.660
The last chess piece that we need to put on our board today are the

119
00:06:42.661 --> 00:06:43.494
missionaries.

120
00:06:43.510 --> 00:06:47.100
Protestant missionaries have been active in China before our story is set,

121
00:06:47.120 --> 00:06:50.660
but then been forced to work in secrets and keep really low profile.

122
00:06:50.670 --> 00:06:52.140
After the first opium war, though,

123
00:06:52.141 --> 00:06:55.980
they suddenly had a lot more freedom to move around and preach.

124
00:06:56.460 --> 00:06:58.370
When Hong discovered the Bible in 1843,

125
00:06:58.430 --> 00:07:02.010
he was just one of the millions of Chinese learning about the good book for the

126
00:07:02.011 --> 00:07:05.690
first time. So when Hong starts telling random villages, he's the son of God.

127
00:07:05.691 --> 00:07:09.690
In a few moments, people are going to be primed to believe in the Christ God,

128
00:07:09.870 --> 00:07:12.570
in a way that they simply weren't before.

129
00:07:12.750 --> 00:07:15.330
Not that Hong immediately amassed followers though at first,

130
00:07:15.530 --> 00:07:17.650
his village was mortified by Hong's new career path.

131
00:07:17.650 --> 00:07:21.720
He was a even fired from his school master job in 1844 for calling Confucius a

132
00:07:21.721 --> 00:07:25.120
false God with this rather cruddy career R Hogan, a friends thing,

133
00:07:25.760 --> 00:07:30.480
UNG decided to become traveling preachers. This was not a success.

134
00:07:30.750 --> 00:07:33.400
When the pair entered Gushi province in 1844,

135
00:07:33.460 --> 00:07:37.560
Hong's wacky claims of right look I'm God, you gotta worship me now.

136
00:07:37.710 --> 00:07:41.550
It's how it is. It won in really no friends. And he in Fey,

137
00:07:41.551 --> 00:07:44.150
they soon became loving stocks. What a surprise,

138
00:07:44.570 --> 00:07:49.150
but there was one group who was prepared to listen. Hong's Christian teachings.

139
00:07:49.151 --> 00:07:51.870
They found an audience among the outsider hacker class,

140
00:07:51.900 --> 00:07:55.990
whether because Hong was one of them or just because they were fed up with

141
00:07:56.020 --> 00:07:59.660
Confucius. The hacker began to band around this new Messiah.

142
00:07:59.840 --> 00:08:01.820
By the time Hong left to continuous preaching,

143
00:08:01.960 --> 00:08:05.340
he had enough followers Ang that Fe stayed behind you,

144
00:08:05.820 --> 00:08:10.380
organize them into an effective militia slash cult known as the by

145
00:08:11.180 --> 00:08:15.300
way or God's worshiper society. The militia numbered only a few thousands,

146
00:08:15.320 --> 00:08:20.050
but they would soon become the core of an army that would lay waste

147
00:08:20.470 --> 00:08:21.303
to China.

148
00:08:27.230 --> 00:08:31.570
The next few years was spent with Hong honing this new religion in 1847.

149
00:08:31.571 --> 00:08:34.450
He studied under the American preacher IJ Roberts,

150
00:08:34.451 --> 00:08:37.650
but the two fell out over Hong's rejection of Christ, concepts of forgiveness.

151
00:08:37.790 --> 00:08:41.240
And he decided to focus on his own divinity.

152
00:08:41.340 --> 00:08:45.240
Not long after Hong returned to Grandhi and took charge of things militia

153
00:08:45.600 --> 00:08:48.400
together. They wonder the countryside, fine tuning their message.

154
00:08:48.540 --> 00:08:51.200
The more they walked, the more their anger grew in village.

155
00:08:51.210 --> 00:08:56.040
After village Hong and Fang witnessed the misery and deprivation of Ching rule

156
00:08:56.250 --> 00:08:58.040
faced with all these wasted lives.

157
00:08:58.041 --> 00:09:01.440
Hong began preaching the abolition of private property and the end of social

158
00:09:01.441 --> 00:09:04.320
classes, but his rhetoric, it didn't just stop at property.

159
00:09:04.510 --> 00:09:06.320
Hong started casting the man shoes,

160
00:09:06.380 --> 00:09:10.480
the ethnic group that Ching came from as literal demons before long,

161
00:09:10.481 --> 00:09:14.000
he was prophesizing a millennial final battle between good and evil.

162
00:09:14.110 --> 00:09:18.270
That take place in China. This was enough to make Jing officials take notice.

163
00:09:18.420 --> 00:09:20.150
They began harassing the God worship,

164
00:09:20.430 --> 00:09:23.910
but hoping to stop people believing in Hong's prophesized war. Instead,

165
00:09:24.020 --> 00:09:26.710
they actually triggered it in July,

166
00:09:26.710 --> 00:09:30.830
1850 government troops attacked a God worshipers militia across Grae Hong's

167
00:09:30.831 --> 00:09:35.300
followers. They took up arms. I for, and I became two for tooth,

168
00:09:35.301 --> 00:09:39.980
which became life for a life. Things came to her head in January of 1851.

169
00:09:39.981 --> 00:09:43.860
When government troops attacked Hongs followers in the city of Jing young nearby

170
00:09:43.861 --> 00:09:47.820
some 10,000 God worshipers, they gathered whipped up into a rage.

171
00:09:47.890 --> 00:09:50.300
They marched on Jin yang, the Jing troops.

172
00:09:50.370 --> 00:09:54.700
They just didn't stand a chance by January the 11th Jing Y was overrun.

173
00:09:54.840 --> 00:09:57.050
The city fell all to the God worshipers that day.

174
00:09:57.120 --> 00:10:00.890
Hong declares the creation of the typing heavenly Kings and with himself as

175
00:10:00.891 --> 00:10:05.770
heavenly king and Fang as king of the south, no sooner was gin yang secured.

176
00:10:06.050 --> 00:10:09.170
Then the new heavenly King's army was marching up the young sea river,

177
00:10:09.390 --> 00:10:14.330
no longer the defenders, but rather the attackers. Now, if you were a official,

178
00:10:14.510 --> 00:10:17.320
the next few months must have been rather terrifying.

179
00:10:17.350 --> 00:10:18.840
When Hong started marching his army,

180
00:10:19.000 --> 00:10:21.080
it was only a few thousand strong before long.

181
00:10:21.100 --> 00:10:24.320
He was leading an army of a million people.

182
00:10:24.490 --> 00:10:28.320
There was just something about the way that Hong had captured J yang that made

183
00:10:28.321 --> 00:10:30.040
him seem just a bit legit.

184
00:10:30.120 --> 00:10:33.600
Suddenly everyone with a grievance against the government thought that he was

185
00:10:33.601 --> 00:10:36.440
their man peasants joined the army hackers, intellectuals.

186
00:10:36.480 --> 00:10:40.630
He even tradesmen suffering the post opium, war, economic collapse, Hong,

187
00:10:40.631 --> 00:10:43.590
even less women join his ranks in March into the thick of combat.

188
00:10:43.930 --> 00:10:47.470
He encouraged his followers to grow their hair long something punishable by

189
00:10:47.471 --> 00:10:51.510
death unto Ching law. As 1851 progressed into 1852.

190
00:10:51.650 --> 00:10:54.550
The insurgents they steamrolled across the landscape.

191
00:10:54.690 --> 00:10:58.860
The chings legendary armies. They SC to before them towns and cities,

192
00:10:58.970 --> 00:11:03.740
they just fell without a fight like ISIS sweeping across the deserts of Syria

193
00:11:03.880 --> 00:11:06.500
and Iraq, Hong and his religious fanatics.

194
00:11:06.501 --> 00:11:09.660
They appeared unstoppable and just like ISIS,

195
00:11:09.760 --> 00:11:14.580
the typing developed reputation for brutality as city after

196
00:11:14.610 --> 00:11:17.420
city, before them fell, the type began Massac occurring.

197
00:11:17.500 --> 00:11:20.730
And any civilians who didn't join their ranks captured Shing soldiers.

198
00:11:20.731 --> 00:11:24.570
They were executed any ethnic man Jews taken alive while they didn't remain

199
00:11:24.620 --> 00:11:28.970
alive for much longer by March, 1853, the typing we're approaching Ning.

200
00:11:29.030 --> 00:11:32.850
As people tried to flee the city Hongs army weed out the man Jews and had them

201
00:11:32.851 --> 00:11:33.670
burned alive.

202
00:11:33.670 --> 00:11:37.370
The flames flickering upwards from their melting flesh warned Ning.

203
00:11:38.800 --> 00:11:39.460
Come on March.

204
00:11:39.460 --> 00:11:44.000
The 10th Hong's forces finally captured the city as Hong was carried in by 16

205
00:11:44.001 --> 00:11:45.360
bearers on a yellow silk chair.

206
00:11:45.361 --> 00:11:50.120
He declared an N the new capital of the typing heavenly kingdom meant himself as

207
00:11:50.121 --> 00:11:52.280
the rightful ruler of China. I in Beijing,

208
00:11:52.700 --> 00:11:55.360
all the Jing could do was look on in shock.

209
00:11:55.430 --> 00:11:58.520
Most of Southern China had fallen to this demented Colson.

210
00:11:58.780 --> 00:12:02.320
Now its self proclaimed Messiah had captured one of the empires,

211
00:12:02.321 --> 00:12:03.240
former capitals.

212
00:12:03.420 --> 00:12:06.920
All of a sudden it was starting to look like Hong might actually be right.

213
00:12:07.290 --> 00:12:11.600
Maybe the world was really ending and for the Jing, the apocalypse, well,

214
00:12:11.601 --> 00:12:12.434
it was already here.

215
00:12:19.090 --> 00:12:23.170
Often Ning was made the typing capital a steady stream of Europeans began to

216
00:12:23.171 --> 00:12:27.770
trickle in determined to observe the new Christian kingdom in China and see if

217
00:12:27.771 --> 00:12:29.730
it was for real, what they experienced there. Well,

218
00:12:29.970 --> 00:12:33.210
if the more confused than ever the typing kingdom was so puritanical,

219
00:12:33.420 --> 00:12:36.680
it would've shocked. Even Puritans. There were punishments for smoking,

220
00:12:37.000 --> 00:12:40.320
drinking, or dancing, all forms of sexual conduct carried the death penalty.

221
00:12:40.430 --> 00:12:43.080
Even between husbands and wives. At the same time,

222
00:12:43.360 --> 00:12:46.600
hung himself had retreated to an opulent palace where he lived surrounded by

223
00:12:46.710 --> 00:12:49.480
harm of beautiful women who attended to his every desire.

224
00:12:49.630 --> 00:12:53.680
Then it was the religious aspect. The typing leadership was divided into Kings.

225
00:12:53.850 --> 00:12:57.190
All of whom could supposedly communicate with God. It was the king of the east.

226
00:12:57.750 --> 00:13:00.630
Yahi Chan the king of the west, why Chano and so on.

227
00:13:00.631 --> 00:13:04.110
Each of them would fall into TRAs and speak in tongues with official typing

228
00:13:04.290 --> 00:13:06.910
policy being made during these spooky ceremonies.

229
00:13:07.310 --> 00:13:09.270
But there was more to the heavenly kingdom than me.

230
00:13:09.590 --> 00:13:13.310
Religious mania after Fang had died in battle during the March on naing yang,

231
00:13:13.590 --> 00:13:17.460
she queen the of the east an elevated to Hong's right hand, man with Ning.

232
00:13:17.520 --> 00:13:20.380
Now conquered yang had effectively become the prime minister of the kingdom,

233
00:13:20.700 --> 00:13:24.820
but he was slowly turning it into a functional state throughout 1853 yang

234
00:13:24.890 --> 00:13:27.580
oversaw an intense program of railway building.

235
00:13:27.880 --> 00:13:29.740
He founded a typing postal service,

236
00:13:29.790 --> 00:13:32.220
began collecting taxes and organized the army.

237
00:13:32.440 --> 00:13:36.010
He also instituted social reforms that pre good chairman MAs program.

238
00:13:36.370 --> 00:13:40.330
Then century later yang made men and women equal and he eliminated private

239
00:13:40.570 --> 00:13:43.210
property. So confusing was all this, that Western powers.

240
00:13:43.211 --> 00:13:45.050
They didn't really know what to make of it.

241
00:13:45.150 --> 00:13:48.970
The times of London called Fort Britain to back the typing against the Ching in

242
00:13:49.130 --> 00:13:49.963
Christ and solidarity,

243
00:13:50.410 --> 00:13:53.570
Karl marks first cheered the peasant revolution then decided as violence was

244
00:13:53.660 --> 00:13:55.010
worse than class oppression,

245
00:13:55.250 --> 00:13:58.440
Deni American preacher IJ Roberts was at first so delighted with his old pupil

246
00:13:58.441 --> 00:14:03.000
that he hotfooted to Ning to live there before leaving a year later in disgusted

247
00:14:03.250 --> 00:14:07.320
Hongs and Cian habits, this Western attention, it was encouraged by the typing.

248
00:14:07.700 --> 00:14:10.040
One of Yang's goals as minister was to get American,

249
00:14:10.320 --> 00:14:13.400
French and British businessmen on side and try to wooo their governments into

250
00:14:13.401 --> 00:14:15.680
supporting his and Hong's new state.

251
00:14:15.970 --> 00:14:19.390
It helps to sort of think of the typing as a bit, similar to ISIS,

252
00:14:19.660 --> 00:14:20.630
like the terror group,

253
00:14:20.631 --> 00:14:24.230
they believed they were the true voice of their religion like ISIS.

254
00:14:24.231 --> 00:14:28.150
They hoped others of the same religion would flock to them and help their cause.

255
00:14:28.670 --> 00:14:32.230
And just like ISIS, they used religion to justify unbelievable violence,

256
00:14:32.860 --> 00:14:36.700
even against their own people. The cruel example of this Barbar see,

257
00:14:37.260 --> 00:14:40.860
when it came in 1855, yang was starting to challenge Hong's authority.

258
00:14:40.960 --> 00:14:44.500
The minister had quietly built his own power base in the typing army and was now

259
00:14:44.501 --> 00:14:48.020
claiming God was speaking through him and not Hogans that the heaven leaking

260
00:14:48.021 --> 00:14:49.980
himself was million an imposter.

261
00:14:49.981 --> 00:14:53.200
This would turn out to be a fateful move on September.

262
00:14:53.200 --> 00:14:54.880
The second Hong ordered the king of the west.

263
00:14:55.200 --> 00:14:58.320
Why Tua to exterminate yang over two bloody months,

264
00:14:58.600 --> 00:15:01.920
way slaughtered all of Yang's followers within yang, J soldiers, civilians,

265
00:15:01.921 --> 00:15:06.600
yang, family members, all of them were killed in a nonstop orgy of bloodshed.

266
00:15:06.780 --> 00:15:10.400
It estimated today that 27,000 typing civilians died in the per,

267
00:15:10.660 --> 00:15:14.230
when it was over Hong had way put to the sword as well in the aftermath,

268
00:15:14.260 --> 00:15:16.670
Hong switched the entire way his government functioned.

269
00:15:16.671 --> 00:15:18.830
People were now promoted based, not on merits,

270
00:15:18.831 --> 00:15:23.110
but on personal loyalty to Hong any pretense equality, it was simply gone.

271
00:15:23.290 --> 00:15:26.750
The typing had link kingdom. It was no longer even mascara as a utopia.

272
00:15:26.810 --> 00:15:30.550
It was a brutal dictatorship where everyone's lives were in the hands of a

273
00:15:30.750 --> 00:15:32.340
religiou fanatic. Fortunately,

274
00:15:32.580 --> 00:15:34.140
they would also wouldn't be around for much longer

275
00:15:40.370 --> 00:15:44.540
With the ti date, eating herself like a hungry dragon devouring, its own tail.

276
00:15:44.960 --> 00:15:48.300
Now might be the time to ask where the Ching were during all of this.

277
00:15:48.780 --> 00:15:51.420
Any answer is well, they were all fighting the French. Yeah.

278
00:15:51.760 --> 00:15:53.170
With impeccably bad timing.

279
00:15:53.171 --> 00:15:56.850
The French had chosen to start the second opium war just as Wade was turning

280
00:15:57.410 --> 00:16:00.010
naing into an AOI rather than press the opportunity.

281
00:16:00.070 --> 00:16:02.970
The Ching were instead stretched almost to breaking points,

282
00:16:03.230 --> 00:16:07.250
but there had been a change in the winds of fate, not a perceptible one,

283
00:16:07.310 --> 00:16:08.143
not just yet,

284
00:16:08.230 --> 00:16:12.880
but one that would ultimately become a hurricane in the contested DARS of typing

285
00:16:13.240 --> 00:16:16.000
rural local malicious that started to spring up that were loyal to the Ching

286
00:16:16.050 --> 00:16:17.280
known as the new armies.

287
00:16:17.281 --> 00:16:20.320
These militias were grassroots far focused on local issues.

288
00:16:20.600 --> 00:16:21.960
Although they fought under the Ching banner,

289
00:16:21.961 --> 00:16:25.960
they were basically run by wars who hated the Ching a little less than they

290
00:16:25.961 --> 00:16:29.200
hated the religious nut jobs that were right on their doorstep. In normal times,

291
00:16:29.300 --> 00:16:31.560
the Ching would've tried to crush these toy soldiers,

292
00:16:31.580 --> 00:16:33.150
but these weren't normal times.

293
00:16:33.380 --> 00:16:36.590
Instead the Ching forged in aligns with the new armies on the implicit

294
00:16:36.591 --> 00:16:40.710
understanding that the wars would be left to their own devices.

295
00:16:40.860 --> 00:16:45.270
This would turn out to be the best decision the distant Ching emperors ever made

296
00:16:45.450 --> 00:16:49.110
as the new armies grew alarm bells were also ringing in Western capitals about

297
00:16:49.111 --> 00:16:50.670
the typing in 80 61.

298
00:16:50.671 --> 00:16:54.060
The typing armies tried to take Shanghai in important new U trading port in the

299
00:16:54.061 --> 00:16:57.220
aftermath of the first opium war. The typing failed in their assaults,

300
00:16:57.221 --> 00:17:00.180
but it had convinced the British and the Americans that something needed to be

301
00:17:00.181 --> 00:17:00.450
done.

302
00:17:00.450 --> 00:17:04.380
They began arming the Ching forces and training them just as the official Ching

303
00:17:04.381 --> 00:17:07.660
army was hooking up with the new armies in no time at all,

304
00:17:07.680 --> 00:17:12.100
the revitalized Ching were ready to give the heavenly kingdom hell and hell.

305
00:17:12.530 --> 00:17:13.850
They gave them really.

306
00:17:13.950 --> 00:17:18.850
It is hard to imagine an underworld much worse than the Inferno unleashed on the

307
00:17:18.851 --> 00:17:22.130
typing. After a decade of typing strategies like shoot everyone,

308
00:17:22.131 --> 00:17:24.210
shoot them some more and then set the survivors on fire.

309
00:17:24.390 --> 00:17:28.530
The Ching armies were through with the rules of war from now on the Ching would

310
00:17:28.531 --> 00:17:30.890
raise any town. They passed through to the grounds.

311
00:17:30.891 --> 00:17:32.650
They would mass execute prisoners.

312
00:17:32.651 --> 00:17:37.080
They would put civilians to the so Hong had predicted an apocalyptic final

313
00:17:37.081 --> 00:17:38.760
battle in China. Well,

314
00:17:38.940 --> 00:17:42.080
the Ching were the ones who were going to give it to him for two whole years.

315
00:17:42.640 --> 00:17:46.720
Southern China burned the new armies raped and pilled their way across the

316
00:17:46.721 --> 00:17:47.220
landscape.

317
00:17:47.220 --> 00:17:50.960
The Ching and typing destroyed so many crops that severe famine set in there

318
00:17:50.961 --> 00:17:53.480
were peasant rebellions plagues, the mass destruction of property.

319
00:17:53.700 --> 00:17:58.240
It said that over 600 cities were just wiped from the map. At first,

320
00:17:58.241 --> 00:17:59.800
the outcome of this renewed war,

321
00:17:59.801 --> 00:18:03.840
it was uncertain a late surge by the typee actually got their armies within 70

322
00:18:03.841 --> 00:18:08.240
kilometers of Beijing and the seat of Ching power, but slowly and surely,

323
00:18:08.530 --> 00:18:10.150
the tide began to turn.

324
00:18:10.370 --> 00:18:14.630
The winds of change had finally reached the force of gales and the typing wave

325
00:18:14.890 --> 00:18:18.990
was swept all the way back to Ning. By the summer of 1863,

326
00:18:18.991 --> 00:18:20.590
the Ching armies were encircling.

327
00:18:20.591 --> 00:18:23.590
The heavenly capital supply lines were cut off escape route.

328
00:18:23.820 --> 00:18:27.670
They were blocked come may of 1864, the typing rebel stronghold.

329
00:18:27.671 --> 00:18:30.900
It was completely isolated and its population was starving.

330
00:18:31.120 --> 00:18:32.660
The Ching armies had done the impossible.

331
00:18:32.720 --> 00:18:36.820
They'd recovered from the onslaught to beat the typing of their own game.

332
00:18:37.160 --> 00:18:40.900
Now it would just take one final push to bring about judgment day.

333
00:18:47.320 --> 00:18:51.170
So at this stage, you might be wondering where the heck is that ho dude.

334
00:18:51.310 --> 00:18:55.170
And the answer is well exactly where we left him all the way back in 1856

335
00:18:56.010 --> 00:18:58.810
insiders palace in N completely unable to grasp reality.

336
00:18:59.060 --> 00:19:00.970
After the murder of yang and his supporters,

337
00:19:00.971 --> 00:19:04.850
Hong had completely disappeared from public view retreating into a world of Ory

338
00:19:04.870 --> 00:19:09.050
and vice while his kingdom burns policy making had been left to squabbling

339
00:19:09.051 --> 00:19:13.160
generals with the result that the Ching fightback went unanswered until it was

340
00:19:13.220 --> 00:19:14.760
too late by 1862,

341
00:19:14.761 --> 00:19:18.680
the few typing leaders able to speak to Hong urged him to evacuate the city.

342
00:19:18.750 --> 00:19:23.080
They wanted him to fall back and to regroup to every single one.

343
00:19:23.350 --> 00:19:25.040
Hong had said the same thing,

344
00:19:25.500 --> 00:19:29.680
no one would leave not while the typing had got on their side.

345
00:19:29.940 --> 00:19:31.070
So people bull stayed.

346
00:19:31.300 --> 00:19:33.830
They stayed as the Ching armies strangled the supply lines.

347
00:19:33.980 --> 00:19:38.790
They stayed as food run out and they stayed as starvation gripped come

348
00:19:38.950 --> 00:19:39.700
1864,

349
00:19:39.700 --> 00:19:43.910
even Hong's most devoted disciples could see that the typing were in trouble

350
00:19:44.080 --> 00:19:48.430
three years before a Ching siege of the typing city of Anne qu had resulted in

351
00:19:48.431 --> 00:19:49.430
industrial scale.

352
00:19:49.431 --> 00:19:53.540
Cannibalism human flesh had have been sold in the local markets desperate to

353
00:19:53.541 --> 00:19:56.100
avoid a similar situation in naing Hong's advisors.

354
00:19:56.101 --> 00:19:59.340
They begged him to do something. Finally, the second son of God,

355
00:19:59.800 --> 00:20:01.980
he agreed leaving his palace for the last time.

356
00:20:02.220 --> 00:20:05.620
Hong appeared to his people and declared that God would provide for them like

357
00:20:05.621 --> 00:20:09.060
Moses in the deserts, they would eat manner scent from the heavens.

358
00:20:09.360 --> 00:20:12.650
He ordered his people to go and gather this manner, wherever they could find it.

359
00:20:12.760 --> 00:20:16.810
What the starving prisoners of Ning found were weeds, weeds,

360
00:20:17.030 --> 00:20:20.130
and wild growing in edible berries. Nonetheless,

361
00:20:20.131 --> 00:20:23.610
they gathered them all and returned to their leader. P smiles at their bounty,

362
00:20:23.850 --> 00:20:25.770
blessed the food and had it cooked. Finally,

363
00:20:25.910 --> 00:20:29.010
the heavenly king took his bowl of manner, ate from it.

364
00:20:29.510 --> 00:20:31.730
And then he promptly died from food poisoning.

365
00:20:31.731 --> 00:20:34.200
Turns out those inedible berries were really,

366
00:20:34.260 --> 00:20:37.600
really inedible rather than mana Hong had provided his people with the Chinese

367
00:20:37.601 --> 00:20:40.040
version of Jonestown brand. Kool-Aid.

368
00:20:40.220 --> 00:20:42.520
Now there are some who dispute this account of Hong's death.

369
00:20:42.521 --> 00:20:45.720
There is another school that says that he intentionally committed suicide.

370
00:20:45.721 --> 00:20:49.520
And yet another that says he died after contracting an illness in practical

371
00:20:49.521 --> 00:20:50.340
terms, though,

372
00:20:50.340 --> 00:20:53.400
it doesn't really matter in the aftermath of Hong's Ascension to heaven,

373
00:20:53.540 --> 00:20:56.200
or maybe his dissent to hell his teenage song.

374
00:20:56.440 --> 00:20:59.920
Hong was put on the throne by now, though it was hopeless.

375
00:20:59.980 --> 00:21:01.720
The Jing were literally at the gates.

376
00:21:01.930 --> 00:21:05.000
These were the last days of Sodom and the brimstone.

377
00:21:05.340 --> 00:21:08.310
It was on its way on July, the 19 18 64,

378
00:21:08.311 --> 00:21:11.110
the Ching retook Ning in a three day street battle.

379
00:21:11.420 --> 00:21:16.390
This was the time where the bloodiest battle humankind had ever seen took place.

380
00:21:16.870 --> 00:21:18.990
There were house by house massacres as an Ning fell,

381
00:21:19.430 --> 00:21:21.310
mass suicides is typing true believers,

382
00:21:21.311 --> 00:21:24.670
gathered together and set themselves on fire by thousands. It was the song.

383
00:21:24.890 --> 00:21:28.980
The Jones turned massacre and the battle of, and grads all rolled into one.

384
00:21:29.320 --> 00:21:33.860
It was death and destruction on a scale that mankind had never seen before.

385
00:21:34.280 --> 00:21:35.500
The seal had been opened.

386
00:21:36.140 --> 00:21:40.100
Judgment day was here at last after 72 hours of carnage,

387
00:21:40.280 --> 00:21:43.180
the city was pacified in the three days alone.

388
00:21:43.181 --> 00:21:47.020
Over a hundred thousand people had died, but still the killing didn't stop.

389
00:21:47.160 --> 00:21:49.410
The mass executed all of their prisoners.

390
00:21:49.411 --> 00:21:52.170
They forced the surviving typing leaders to write confessions,

391
00:21:52.190 --> 00:21:54.450
and then they executed them too. Finally,

392
00:21:54.600 --> 00:21:58.730
they exhumed Hong's corpse from its resting place inside his palace and had it

393
00:21:58.731 --> 00:22:03.090
cremated tradition says they fired his ashes out of a cannon to deny him resting

394
00:22:03.091 --> 00:22:06.290
place. Although sporadic fighting would continue until 1866,

395
00:22:06.291 --> 00:22:09.960
the typing rebellion was officially owed it's heavenly king. He was dead.

396
00:22:10.190 --> 00:22:14.480
It's heavenly kingdom. If bla ashes in the 14 years of its existence,

397
00:22:14.481 --> 00:22:18.680
the typing rebellion is thought to have killed somewhere in the region of 20

398
00:22:18.680 --> 00:22:21.440
million people. More people than died during world war.

399
00:22:21.560 --> 00:22:25.160
I it's probably the deadliest civil conflicts to have ever cripped the world.

400
00:22:25.460 --> 00:22:29.710
The us civil war killed around 750,000 to the fighting in China.

401
00:22:30.180 --> 00:22:31.390
This was belly a blip.

402
00:22:31.570 --> 00:22:34.950
Not that the death stopped with the rebellions end though, about 75 years later,

403
00:22:35.070 --> 00:22:38.590
a man obsessed with the typing rebellion was inspired by Hong's life to launch

404
00:22:38.591 --> 00:22:41.110
his own revolution in China, known as Maza.

405
00:22:41.490 --> 00:22:46.190
He would go on to oversee a regime that at an absolute minimum killed another

406
00:22:46.870 --> 00:22:50.420
20 million people. Now, Hong may seem like an obscure figure in the west,

407
00:22:50.580 --> 00:22:54.020
a Chinese fanatically committed war crimes in some far away lands,

408
00:22:54.021 --> 00:22:58.620
many decades ago, but in many ways, our world is still living with his legacy.

409
00:22:58.960 --> 00:23:02.660
He may not be as famous as Hitler or Stalin or even ISIS,

410
00:23:02.920 --> 00:23:05.300
but Hong was as terrible as any of them.

411
00:23:05.560 --> 00:23:09.380
And maybe it's time that we found space to remember his victims too.

412
00:23:09.950 --> 00:23:12.410
