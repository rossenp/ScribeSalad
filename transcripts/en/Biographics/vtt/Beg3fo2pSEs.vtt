3
00:00:15.300 --> 00:00:18.040
The power of ancient room seems absolute today,

4
00:00:18.100 --> 00:00:22.830
but that wasn't always the case over 150 years before the great drama of

5
00:00:22.850 --> 00:00:23.683
Julius Caesar,

6
00:00:23.850 --> 00:00:28.670
the Roman Republic faced its greatest existential threat Carthage.

7
00:00:28.770 --> 00:00:32.710
The great north African merchant and empire battled Rome for supremacy of the

8
00:00:32.711 --> 00:00:36.710
Mediterranean and that the Vanguard of Carthage forces was one of the most

9
00:00:36.711 --> 00:00:41.540
brilliant tacticians the world has ever seen. Hannibal four, nearly years,

10
00:00:41.541 --> 00:00:43.540
Hannibal fought against the Romans waging,

11
00:00:43.580 --> 00:00:46.140
a war that would ultimately decide the fate of the known world.

12
00:00:46.480 --> 00:00:49.900
<v 1>He invaded Italy and brought terror to the doorstep of Rome itself.</v>

13
00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:53.740
Every army sent against him was destroyed the brilliance of the general,

14
00:00:53.741 --> 00:00:57.780
allowing him to repeatedly surprise baffle out, maneuver and out,

15
00:00:58.020 --> 00:01:01.340
fight his enemy for a time. It seemed Rome itself would be conquered,

16
00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:05.050
but in the end, Hannibal was undone not by Roman armies,

17
00:01:05.230 --> 00:01:07.730
but by the apathy and greed of his own leaders.

18
00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:12.050
He ended his days in EXR watching his Roman power grew unchecked over his

19
00:01:12.051 --> 00:01:12.590
Homeland.

20
00:01:12.590 --> 00:01:17.450
And eventually most of the known world this today is the story of

21
00:01:17.451 --> 00:01:18.284
Hannibal.

22
00:01:24.340 --> 00:01:25.400
<v 0>To understand Hannibal,</v>

23
00:01:25.460 --> 00:01:28.760
you have to understand where he came from Carthage located in the modern day

24
00:01:28.761 --> 00:01:33.520
capital of tunas on the coast of north Africa began as a small trade colony

25
00:01:33.580 --> 00:01:38.040
and quickly bloomed into the center of a vast trading empire. At one point,

26
00:01:38.041 --> 00:01:40.920
it controlled all or large parts of all the islands of the Western

27
00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:44.070
Mediterranean, including course SAR and Sicily.

28
00:01:44.300 --> 00:01:46.630
This brought them into conflict with the Roman Republic,

29
00:01:46.640 --> 00:01:51.110
which was consolidating its hold on the Italian peninsula and expanding outwards

30
00:01:51.210 --> 00:01:54.190
in search of power and wealth. In 264 BC,

31
00:01:54.210 --> 00:01:55.990
the two powers went to war with each other.

32
00:01:56.130 --> 00:02:00.150
The conflicts that lasted for over 20 years and was financially and militarily

33
00:02:00.430 --> 00:02:01.750
are disaster for the IANS.

34
00:02:01.940 --> 00:02:05.380
They were forced to S of control of much of their island territory,

35
00:02:05.470 --> 00:02:06.740
which was a huge blow.

36
00:02:06.810 --> 00:02:10.740
They were also forced by treaty to pay an indemnity to Rome,

37
00:02:10.790 --> 00:02:15.540
which further sapped car's resources in the midst of this Hann was born in

38
00:02:16.460 --> 00:02:18.660
247, BC, the son of Hamilton car Barker,

39
00:02:18.661 --> 00:02:21.980
one of the leading car generals during the war with Rome,

40
00:02:22.580 --> 00:02:26.330
Hamilton Kong was engaged a bitter political struggle with other Carin and

41
00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:28.330
aristocrats for control of the country.

42
00:02:28.630 --> 00:02:33.290
He decided that the best way to advance car's interests as well as his own was

43
00:02:33.310 --> 00:02:35.170
to conquer the Iberian peninsula.

44
00:02:35.470 --> 00:02:38.010
The modern day countries of Spain and Portugal.

45
00:02:38.300 --> 00:02:41.010
There was enough territory and resources there,

46
00:02:41.060 --> 00:02:45.960
especially silver mines to both pay the war at Toone Naton to rebuild

47
00:02:46.340 --> 00:02:51.040
and pay for car's armies Hamel car left for this mission in 237

48
00:02:51.300 --> 00:02:53.320
BC accompanied by his nine year old son.

49
00:02:53.321 --> 00:02:56.360
Hannibal legend says that before they left Hamel car,

50
00:02:56.361 --> 00:03:01.080
took his son to a temple and had to make a vow of eternal hatred towards Rome.

51
00:03:01.220 --> 00:03:05.200
<v 1>It would be many years before Hannibal would see the city of Carthage again,</v>

52
00:03:05.390 --> 00:03:07.160
over the course of the next nine years,

53
00:03:07.560 --> 00:03:10.000
Hamilton car campaigned ceaselessly in Liberia,

54
00:03:10.001 --> 00:03:13.960
gaining vast tracks of territory for Carthage and its vast amounts of wealth.

55
00:03:13.961 --> 00:03:18.160
Flowing back to the CA mainly golden silver from mines in the conquered

56
00:03:18.280 --> 00:03:18.850
territory.

57
00:03:18.850 --> 00:03:21.990
<v 0>During this time, Hannibal grew up surrounded by soldiers,</v>

58
00:03:22.350 --> 00:03:24.990
learning the science of war from his father and offices.

59
00:03:25.450 --> 00:03:28.590
It was clear that the boy had a to for battle by the age of 18,

60
00:03:28.850 --> 00:03:30.390
he was already commanding troops.

61
00:03:30.910 --> 00:03:35.790
Hamma car Barker was killed in battle in 228 BC and commands of the Carthaginian

62
00:03:35.791 --> 00:03:39.900
forces Inia fell to Hannibal's brother-in-law DRAL the fair.

63
00:03:40.010 --> 00:03:40.940
Over the following years,

64
00:03:40.980 --> 00:03:45.500
Hannibal gains more experience and influence has DRAL consolidated pathogen's

65
00:03:45.501 --> 00:03:49.580
holdings and signed a treaty with the Romans designating the Ebro river as the

66
00:03:49.581 --> 00:03:53.620
border between car controlled territory and that under the influence of Rome,

67
00:03:53.840 --> 00:03:57.820
but has DRAL was assassinated in 221 BC.

68
00:03:58.080 --> 00:03:59.970
And at only 20 years old,

69
00:04:00.050 --> 00:04:04.090
Hannibal was appointed commander in chief of the army in Iberia.

70
00:04:04.130 --> 00:04:08.410
Hannibal continued the Iberian conquest of his father and brother-in-law for the

71
00:04:08.411 --> 00:04:11.890
next two years drawing right up against the ABRO river border house.

72
00:04:12.290 --> 00:04:13.570
DRAL had agreed upon with Rome.

73
00:04:13.870 --> 00:04:18.410
The Romans watched car's expansion in Iberia with growing concern in an attempts

74
00:04:18.411 --> 00:04:20.400
to check Hannibal's power region.

75
00:04:20.510 --> 00:04:23.680
They allied themselves with the city of SAAM.

76
00:04:24.440 --> 00:04:28.400
Saum was far south of the ABRO river and Hannibal felt the Romans had violated

77
00:04:28.401 --> 00:04:31.400
the treaty, setting the river as a demarcation line.

78
00:04:31.620 --> 00:04:35.960
He laid siege to the city and captured it after eight months in 219 BC

79
00:04:36.720 --> 00:04:39.920
Romes entered delegation to Carthage demanding that they turn over Hannibal to

80
00:04:39.921 --> 00:04:41.550
them to face Roman justice.

81
00:04:41.770 --> 00:04:46.030
But the Tian government appreciative of the treasure Hannibal's conquests were

82
00:04:46.031 --> 00:04:50.870
bringing in back there general. The second war between car and Rome had begun

83
00:04:56.950 --> 00:05:00.110
Hannibal decided on a bold strategy to defeat the Romans.

84
00:05:00.210 --> 00:05:04.180
He would March a Overlands from Iberia across Southern Goul modern day,

85
00:05:04.181 --> 00:05:06.180
France and invade Italy itself.

86
00:05:06.400 --> 00:05:09.620
The Romans anticipated this and sent armies intercept him,

87
00:05:09.621 --> 00:05:12.100
but he evaded them and made his way across.

88
00:05:12.540 --> 00:05:15.060
Goul at the head of an army of 40,000 infantry,

89
00:05:15.150 --> 00:05:19.340
8,000 cavalry and 38 wars. His troops came from all over the place.

90
00:05:19.530 --> 00:05:22.490
Many were mercenaries fighting, not for country, but for treasure,

91
00:05:22.720 --> 00:05:26.810
many more were local tribesmen who Hannibal recruited along the way who hated

92
00:05:27.090 --> 00:05:29.290
Rome and would fight with anyone who opposed her,

93
00:05:29.390 --> 00:05:33.810
always all on for the audacious Hannibal crossed the Alps in 218 BC,

94
00:05:33.870 --> 00:05:35.010
the journey was hard going.

95
00:05:35.160 --> 00:05:37.810
It's believed that half his army perished in the mountains,

96
00:05:37.811 --> 00:05:41.610
including most of his elephants, but he took the Romans completely by surprise.

97
00:05:41.611 --> 00:05:46.000
When he in the PO valley in Northern Italy recruiting allies among the local

98
00:05:46.001 --> 00:05:47.720
population to bolsters ranks,

99
00:05:47.840 --> 00:05:52.120
opposing him were two Roman armies commanded by the two consoles elected that

100
00:05:52.121 --> 00:05:56.240
year Publius scoo was the older of the two and a season commander,

101
00:05:56.260 --> 00:06:00.360
but he had been wounded in an earlier skirmish with Hannibal's forces and hadn't

102
00:06:00.361 --> 00:06:04.440
yet recover. Tiberius Cron was brash and headstrong.

103
00:06:04.441 --> 00:06:08.520
He was itching to engage Hannibal, despite SCO, cautioning him to wait.

104
00:06:08.660 --> 00:06:11.120
The two armies faced each other across the river trivia.

105
00:06:11.220 --> 00:06:15.600
The year was almost over new consoles would soon be elected for 217.

106
00:06:15.820 --> 00:06:19.270
And Cron knew that he was about to lose his chance of glory.

107
00:06:19.790 --> 00:06:23.550
Military victories were the surest way of political advancement in the Roman

108
00:06:23.870 --> 00:06:27.270
Republic. Hannibal knew this and he sought to take advantage of it.

109
00:06:27.450 --> 00:06:31.350
On December the 21st 218 Hannibal put his plan into motion.

110
00:06:31.530 --> 00:06:36.510
He sent a force of P median Calvary across the river to harass the Roman camp in

111
00:06:36.710 --> 00:06:37.020
response.

112
00:06:37.020 --> 00:06:41.140
<v 1>And prones deployed his entire army to drive them off the Romans pursued the</v>

113
00:06:41.340 --> 00:06:42.500
Newin back across the river.

114
00:06:43.020 --> 00:06:45.700
Traia forcing the infantry to Wade through chest high water.

115
00:06:45.980 --> 00:06:48.020
There was freezing cold in the snowy conditions.

116
00:06:48.400 --> 00:06:50.100
By the time the army made it across,

117
00:06:50.170 --> 00:06:54.100
they were exhausted and probably suffering from hypothermia Hannibal's army.

118
00:06:54.160 --> 00:06:57.770
<v 0>On the other hand was well rested and he quickly moved to engage of the</v>

119
00:06:57.771 --> 00:06:58.430
disorganized.

120
00:06:58.430 --> 00:07:01.730
Romans suddenly a small force under the command of Hannibal's younger brother

121
00:07:02.250 --> 00:07:06.290
Mego emerged from its hiding place and attacked the Romans from behind causing

122
00:07:06.291 --> 00:07:09.450
the entire formation to break and run. It was a massacre.

123
00:07:09.480 --> 00:07:13.130
Many Romans were killed fleeing for their lives and more drowned in the river to

124
00:07:13.131 --> 00:07:14.450
exhausted to make it across.

125
00:07:14.840 --> 00:07:19.360
It's believed the Roman army suffered 28 to 30,000 casualties that day

126
00:07:19.840 --> 00:07:21.600
compared to only 5,000 for Hannibal.

127
00:07:21.860 --> 00:07:25.640
The battle of the river tra was a resounding success for Hannibal.

128
00:07:25.660 --> 00:07:27.840
It was the first demonstration of his tactical genius.

129
00:07:28.060 --> 00:07:30.720
And the first time he had truly terrified Rome,

130
00:07:31.300 --> 00:07:35.840
but it wouldn't be the last and one thing you don't have to be terrified of is

131
00:07:35.841 --> 00:07:37.160
shaving with bad raises,

132
00:07:37.161 --> 00:07:39.710

155
00:09:01.940 --> 00:09:05.640
In the spring of 217, Hannibal decided he needed to March south.

156
00:09:05.660 --> 00:09:08.440
The Gaelic allies had won over after the battle of traia,

157
00:09:08.680 --> 00:09:10.240
which not remain as friends for long.

158
00:09:10.241 --> 00:09:12.680
If his army sat still and ate all the food in the region,

159
00:09:12.870 --> 00:09:16.550
instead of fighting the hated Romans. Meanwhile, on the Roman side,

160
00:09:16.570 --> 00:09:20.470
the two newly elected consoles were sent north with armies in order to stop

161
00:09:20.471 --> 00:09:24.110
Hannibal, there were only two roads that Hannibal could use to advance south.

162
00:09:24.210 --> 00:09:28.230
And the Roman plan was for each console to position his army on one of these

163
00:09:28.550 --> 00:09:28.551
route,

164
00:09:28.551 --> 00:09:33.070
forcing Hannibal to fight his way through them and giving the other army time to

165
00:09:33.071 --> 00:09:37.780
reinforce GRE civilians was in command of the Eastern army on the AIC

166
00:09:37.830 --> 00:09:41.860
coast while GAAS FLAS command at the west army at a,

167
00:09:42.450 --> 00:09:45.260
this is south of theanine mountains in central Italy,

168
00:09:45.261 --> 00:09:48.380
Hannibal was faced with too bad options, but again,

169
00:09:48.381 --> 00:09:51.540
showing the audacity for which he was quickly becoming legends.

170
00:09:51.800 --> 00:09:52.980
He chose the third route.

171
00:09:53.200 --> 00:09:57.570
The honor river valley to the west of Flass position was known for flooding at

172
00:09:57.571 --> 00:10:01.210
that time of year. And it was considered to be impossible to an army.

173
00:10:01.390 --> 00:10:02.690
So it wasn't guarded.

174
00:10:02.700 --> 00:10:06.290
Hannibal's army boldly crossed it in just four days though.

175
00:10:06.291 --> 00:10:07.450
The March was not without loss.

176
00:10:07.480 --> 00:10:10.010
Many men drowned in the marshes or died of infection.

177
00:10:10.011 --> 00:10:13.050
And Hannibal himself was blinded in one eye by such an infection.

178
00:10:13.330 --> 00:10:17.400
Hannibal once again had surprised the Romans by appearing where he wasn't

179
00:10:17.520 --> 00:10:20.600
supposed to be Flamini sent were to civilians to come to his support.

180
00:10:20.601 --> 00:10:23.800
Hannibal knew that he couldn't allow both Roman armies to combine.

181
00:10:23.900 --> 00:10:27.640
So he resolved to destroy Flamini before civilians could arrive.

182
00:10:27.960 --> 00:10:31.520
He attempted to go Flamini and to battle by laying waste of the countryside

183
00:10:31.521 --> 00:10:33.920
around a he. And when that didn't work,

184
00:10:33.940 --> 00:10:38.310
he boldly marched completely around Flamini us and cut him off from Rome.

185
00:10:38.620 --> 00:10:39.910
Then he continued south.

186
00:10:40.470 --> 00:10:44.670
If marching on the city Flamini was another Roman commander who was prone to

187
00:10:45.670 --> 00:10:46.670
impetuousness and rash action.

188
00:10:47.030 --> 00:10:50.030
And this ins insult by Hannibal could not go unchallenged.

189
00:10:50.130 --> 00:10:53.030
He rallied his troops and started quickly after Hannibal,

190
00:10:53.031 --> 00:10:57.540
while civilians was still too far away to help him on June the 21st hundred and

191
00:10:57.780 --> 00:11:01.780
17 FLAS was pursuing the Carin army down in narrow road.

192
00:11:01.990 --> 00:11:06.180
Hemin on the side by tall Hills and on the right by the shores of lake.

193
00:11:06.740 --> 00:11:09.900
Chamine a thick mist hung over the area, reducing visibility.

194
00:11:10.000 --> 00:11:12.540
The Romans were strung out in marching formation.

195
00:11:12.541 --> 00:11:15.140
Still believing that Hannibal was ahead of them on the move.

196
00:11:15.260 --> 00:11:17.180
Suddenly trumpets sounded from their left,

197
00:11:17.380 --> 00:11:20.810
a unknown to the Romans Hannibal had doubled back during the night,

198
00:11:21.050 --> 00:11:22.930
positioning his arm in the Hills, above the road.

199
00:11:23.190 --> 00:11:25.890
He was in a perfect position to ambush Flamini.

200
00:11:26.310 --> 00:11:28.450
The Romans were caught completely by surprise.

201
00:11:28.550 --> 00:11:32.290
The Carthaginian forces rushed down the Hills and attacked the unprepared Romans

202
00:11:32.320 --> 00:11:34.370
more units cut the road on both sides,

203
00:11:34.371 --> 00:11:37.610
pinning the enemy between their swords and the waters of the lake.

204
00:11:38.760 --> 00:11:41.280
Legionaries attempted to flee from the Carthaginians by swimming.

205
00:11:41.590 --> 00:11:46.360
Most of whom drowned in their heavy armor FLAS was dead hacked to pieces by

206
00:11:46.361 --> 00:11:49.920
Hannibal's Gaelic allies and the rest of the army. Didn't far much better.

207
00:11:50.180 --> 00:11:54.120
At least 15,000 men were killed. And another 15,000 were taken prisoner.

208
00:11:54.580 --> 00:11:57.440
The battle of lake Chamine remains to this day,

209
00:11:57.500 --> 00:12:01.200
the largest and most successful ambush in military history with,

210
00:12:01.360 --> 00:12:05.640
for men's army destroyed and civilian's army unexpectedly pinned and bla by

211
00:12:05.710 --> 00:12:08.000
attacking go along the AIC coast.

212
00:12:08.440 --> 00:12:12.400
That was now no one to oppose Hannibal Rome panicked at the thought of that

213
00:12:13.070 --> 00:12:13.570
Carin in general,

214
00:12:13.570 --> 00:12:18.550
at the gates to their city and appointed a dictator Fabius Maximus to save

215
00:12:18.570 --> 00:12:22.470
the Republic. Hannibal, meanwhile decided not to attack Rome this time.

216
00:12:22.570 --> 00:12:24.710
He didn't think he needed to in order to bring them to heal.

217
00:12:24.970 --> 00:12:28.790
He figured by turning Rome's Italian allies against them and hampering their

218
00:12:28.791 --> 00:12:32.110
ability to make war by destroying and looting their food supplies.

219
00:12:32.290 --> 00:12:34.260
He could force him to the negotiating table.

220
00:12:34.520 --> 00:12:37.300
The aim of the war was not to conquer the Roman Republic,

221
00:12:37.480 --> 00:12:42.260
but to regain the lost territories of Sicily Sannia and Corsica and to humble

222
00:12:42.370 --> 00:12:45.580
Rome, as Rome had done to Carthage at the end of the first war,

223
00:12:45.960 --> 00:12:47.860
but Hannibal had misjudged his enemy.

224
00:12:48.080 --> 00:12:52.300
The Romans were what modern military tactics would call a total war nation.

225
00:12:52.520 --> 00:12:55.970
The fate of the entire a nation wrote on its military success.

226
00:12:56.400 --> 00:12:57.450
They did not surrender.

227
00:12:57.760 --> 00:13:01.890
They would rather Rome be burned to the grounds than negotiate with a victorious

228
00:13:01.891 --> 00:13:02.320
enemy.

229
00:13:02.320 --> 00:13:07.250
Many people consider Hannibal's bypassing Rome instead of preceding it in 217

230
00:13:07.670 --> 00:13:12.050
as his greatest mistake, regardless, Hannibal was now loose south of Rome,

231
00:13:12.051 --> 00:13:13.050
burning and pilling.

232
00:13:13.050 --> 00:13:18.000
As he went viewed by fabs at the head of a new army fabs adopted a new

233
00:13:18.320 --> 00:13:20.840
strategy instead of seeking urban battle with Hannibal,

234
00:13:20.940 --> 00:13:24.640
he sought to contain him to shadow his movements and force him into making a

235
00:13:24.641 --> 00:13:28.160
mistake. But this strategy wasn't popular with the Roman Senate,

236
00:13:28.330 --> 00:13:32.440
especially not the Aris to crowds estates were being Lood in campaign.

237
00:13:32.750 --> 00:13:37.270
They urged him to pursue a more aggressive strategy, but Fabius refused.

238
00:13:37.750 --> 00:13:40.190
He'd already seen two Roman armies destroyed by Hannibal,

239
00:13:40.191 --> 00:13:41.750
and he wasn't about to be the third,

240
00:13:41.890 --> 00:13:46.510
but Fabius prestige was damaged when Hannibal escaped to planned in Ciment

241
00:13:46.511 --> 00:13:50.990
through a clever R that a for learners and the Roman public was beginning to

242
00:13:51.350 --> 00:13:52.130
derive him as a COE.

243
00:13:52.130 --> 00:13:56.100
He was removed from his poster as a dictator and the Republic elected two new

244
00:13:56.101 --> 00:14:00.660
consoles for 216 Tarus Varo and Amelia's Paulis

245
00:14:00.850 --> 00:14:04.380
both were placed in co command of a massive new army of 86,000 men.

246
00:14:04.480 --> 00:14:07.860
The largest RO ever field didn't order to stop Hannibal

247
00:14:14.140 --> 00:14:16.770
Hannibal had spent the time has escaped from Fabius,

248
00:14:17.010 --> 00:14:21.210
encouraging defections from Romans Italian allies in the south and attacking

249
00:14:21.211 --> 00:14:22.044
Roman settlements.

250
00:14:22.070 --> 00:14:25.970
He heard about the deployments of the massive Roman force against him and moved

251
00:14:25.971 --> 00:14:30.490
quickly to strike first capturing the important supply depo at Canna on the AIC

252
00:14:30.500 --> 00:14:31.730
coast. Once again,

253
00:14:31.950 --> 00:14:36.640
he was forcing the Romans into a battle on the ground of his choosing on August.

254
00:14:36.880 --> 00:14:38.000
The second 216,

255
00:14:38.001 --> 00:14:41.680
the two armies met outside of can a VA in command of the army that day,

256
00:14:41.681 --> 00:14:44.840
Roman law required the duke consoles to alternate command each day,

257
00:14:44.841 --> 00:14:48.800
tightly packed his Legionnaires together in order to smash the IANS in the

258
00:14:48.801 --> 00:14:51.040
center of the battle line. As a result though,

259
00:14:51.200 --> 00:14:52.920
we had vastly more troops than Hannibal did.

260
00:14:53.010 --> 00:14:55.240
Their battle lines were roughly the same size.

261
00:14:55.320 --> 00:14:59.440
Hannibal anticipating this planned to use virus, deep formation against him.

262
00:14:59.660 --> 00:15:03.920
He placed light infantry in the center of his line and his strongest infantry on

263
00:15:03.921 --> 00:15:07.720
his two FLAS when the battle always joined the center of Hannibal's line was

264
00:15:07.721 --> 00:15:11.910
forced back while the flanks held firm Hannibal's took on a Crescent shape,

265
00:15:11.911 --> 00:15:14.990
drawing more and more Legionnaires to the center of the attack.

266
00:15:15.550 --> 00:15:16.470
What they didn't realize, however,

267
00:15:16.690 --> 00:15:20.470
was that they were being drawn into a trap pushing back Hannibal's line in the

268
00:15:20.471 --> 00:15:22.230
center and not in the flanks.

269
00:15:22.231 --> 00:15:25.790
They had surrounded themselves on three sides with enemy troops,

270
00:15:26.030 --> 00:15:29.070
since they're already tight formation became even tighter to the point of many

271
00:15:29.130 --> 00:15:32.340
Romans being unable to swing their weapons at this crucial moment,

272
00:15:32.520 --> 00:15:36.420
the Carin cavalry who had chased off the Roman horseman earlier in the battle

273
00:15:36.810 --> 00:15:38.820
returns and attacked the Romans from the rear,

274
00:15:39.040 --> 00:15:43.500
the Roman army was now completely surrounded and Hannibal ordered all forces to

275
00:15:43.501 --> 00:15:45.060
attack. It was a complete slaughter.

276
00:15:45.280 --> 00:15:49.180
The Romans had nowhere to go and were killed by the tens of thousands.

277
00:15:49.480 --> 00:15:52.650
By the time darkness fell there was and left of the Roman army.

278
00:15:52.950 --> 00:15:54.450
It had been utterly annihilated.

279
00:15:54.790 --> 00:15:59.370
The few survivors led by Varo escaped back to Rome to reveal the horror to the

280
00:15:59.371 --> 00:16:03.170
Roman people. The totality of the defeat was astounding. In one day,

281
00:16:03.190 --> 00:16:05.690
the Romans had suffered 68,000 casualties.

282
00:16:05.910 --> 00:16:10.690
The deads included the other consular commander Amelia and over 100 other

283
00:16:10.790 --> 00:16:13.560
Romans who held hide leadership positions in the Republic,

284
00:16:13.710 --> 00:16:15.200
including 80 senators.

285
00:16:15.410 --> 00:16:19.960
Hannibal's brother Mego demonstrated the scale of the victory by overturning a

286
00:16:19.961 --> 00:16:23.480
large and filled with gold sign rings in the Carthaginian Senate.

287
00:16:23.960 --> 00:16:26.640
Each ring taken from the hand of a slain Roman nobleman.

288
00:16:26.660 --> 00:16:31.080
The battle a Cade would be the worst defeat suffered by Rome in her 1000 year

289
00:16:31.081 --> 00:16:35.070
history as a Republic. And later as an empire, things got even worse.

290
00:16:35.270 --> 00:16:37.990
The romance after Canna, the entire south of Italy,

291
00:16:38.230 --> 00:16:39.190
Def defected to Hannibal's side,

292
00:16:39.191 --> 00:16:42.070
including two of the largest cities on the peninsula Kaur.

293
00:16:42.290 --> 00:16:43.830
And Tarren in addition,

294
00:16:43.890 --> 00:16:48.390
the kingdoms of Macon and Syracuse allied with Carthage against Rome in less

295
00:16:48.391 --> 00:16:52.790
than two years, Roman lost 20% of a military age males to Hannibal's campaigns.

296
00:16:53.080 --> 00:16:55.860
The entire Italian peninsula was devastated.

297
00:16:56.120 --> 00:16:59.220
And yet when Hannibal offered to negotiate peace terms,

298
00:16:59.640 --> 00:17:04.020
the Roman Senate refused they would not give up. And so the war continued.

299
00:17:10.020 --> 00:17:13.380
Hannibal did not March on Rome after cane, though many in his army,

300
00:17:13.570 --> 00:17:14.650
he called for him to do so.

301
00:17:14.910 --> 00:17:18.290
His reasoning for doing so was the same as when he didn't tank the city.

302
00:17:18.310 --> 00:17:20.930
The year before that wasn't the goal of this war.

303
00:17:21.230 --> 00:17:23.850
He continued to consolidate his position in Southern Italy,

304
00:17:23.890 --> 00:17:28.330
rallying more Italian allies to his cause while the Romans returned to the

305
00:17:28.350 --> 00:17:30.930
Fabian strategy of containment over open battle.

306
00:17:31.350 --> 00:17:35.320
And this is the point where things started to go against Hannibal while Carthage

307
00:17:35.321 --> 00:17:36.880
celebrated Hannibal's victories,

308
00:17:36.910 --> 00:17:40.720
they seemed to treat the Italian invasion as a side show of the war.

309
00:17:40.800 --> 00:17:44.920
Hannibal was never seriously reinforced or resupplied from Carthage.

310
00:17:45.060 --> 00:17:48.400
All of car's available troops were being sent to places like Iberia,

311
00:17:48.401 --> 00:17:52.480
where Roman army had been sent to block cannibals reinforcement and do efforts

312
00:17:52.481 --> 00:17:55.760
to retake Sicily. The central failing of Carthage was coming to light.

313
00:17:55.830 --> 00:17:58.960
They were too greedy trying to take too much territory,

314
00:17:59.170 --> 00:18:01.040
fight on too many fronts at once.

315
00:18:01.270 --> 00:18:04.400
This was caused by Carthage not being a martial culture.

316
00:18:04.700 --> 00:18:09.270
The way Rome was sons of wealthy Carthaginian Aris Toras were not a expected to

317
00:18:09.271 --> 00:18:12.990
serve in the army. The way Romans were. They relied heavily on mercenaries,

318
00:18:12.991 --> 00:18:16.870
which required vast sums of money to maintain that in turn required,

319
00:18:17.070 --> 00:18:20.510
territory and treasure from her existing armies and trade fleets.

320
00:18:20.530 --> 00:18:23.590
The bottom line was that for essentially the entire time he was in Italy,

321
00:18:23.630 --> 00:18:27.870
Hannibal was on his own fighting a personal battle with Roman being supported

322
00:18:27.900 --> 00:18:29.380
very little by his home country.

323
00:18:29.900 --> 00:18:34.780
He remains in essentially a stale mate in Southern Italy for years fighting back

324
00:18:34.781 --> 00:18:38.700
and forth in a battle with an increasingly strong Roman force. Meanwhile,

325
00:18:38.701 --> 00:18:41.980
the Romans repulsed the IANS in Sicily and in Liberia,

326
00:18:41.981 --> 00:18:43.580
the Romans were using the same tactic.

327
00:18:43.580 --> 00:18:46.780
Cannibal was recruiting local allies to fight on their behalf.

328
00:18:47.080 --> 00:18:51.690
The turning points came in 204, B C SCO, Africanist, Romes,

329
00:18:51.691 --> 00:18:55.730
best general who'd commanded armies to great success in Iberia invaded Africa

330
00:18:56.570 --> 00:18:57.890
Carthridge seems unable to stop him.

331
00:18:58.050 --> 00:19:02.290
And in desperation recalled Hannibal from Italy to defend the car Homeland.

332
00:19:02.430 --> 00:19:04.570
And so 15 years after crossing the Alps,

333
00:19:04.571 --> 00:19:08.050
Hannibal left Italy or HND and returned to Africa for the first time,

334
00:19:08.100 --> 00:19:10.880
since he was a small boy in of a large army,

335
00:19:10.881 --> 00:19:13.040
including veterans of his Italian campaign,

336
00:19:13.260 --> 00:19:16.120
he faced SCO in 202,

337
00:19:16.300 --> 00:19:20.840
but this time he faced an enemy who had studied Hannibal's tactics and the best

338
00:19:20.870 --> 00:19:24.880
ways to counter him Hannibal's army was defeated in large part due to the

339
00:19:25.080 --> 00:19:26.680
superiority of the Roman cavalry,

340
00:19:26.681 --> 00:19:29.480
which had been a critical weakness of their armies in Italy.

341
00:19:35.850 --> 00:19:38.910
The war was over Carthage was forced to agree to peace terms,

342
00:19:39.020 --> 00:19:41.790
even harsher than that at the end of the first war,

343
00:19:41.791 --> 00:19:44.950
essentially ending any hope of ever challenging Rome. Again,

344
00:19:45.030 --> 00:19:47.910
Hannibal started a political career in Carthage after the war,

345
00:19:47.970 --> 00:19:50.550
hoping to rebuild the country's shattered economy,

346
00:19:50.870 --> 00:19:54.500
but he was driven into exile by his enemies who wanted to surrender him to the

347
00:19:54.501 --> 00:19:55.000
Romans.

348
00:19:55.000 --> 00:19:59.540
He found refuge in the court of the saluted king and heiaus III in Anatolia,

349
00:19:59.541 --> 00:20:00.380
modern day Turkey.

350
00:20:00.680 --> 00:20:05.060
He served as a chief military advisor there Baan Orus was defeated by the Romans

351
00:20:05.061 --> 00:20:09.500
in 188 BC and Hannibal left again for the kingdom of Bethe,

352
00:20:09.790 --> 00:20:11.420
which was on the shores of the black,

353
00:20:11.990 --> 00:20:15.170
but the Romans eventually tracked him down and threatened the Bassians with

354
00:20:15.171 --> 00:20:15.890
handing him over.

355
00:20:15.890 --> 00:20:19.570
Hannibal heard they were coming and refused to be taken by his lifelong enemy.

356
00:20:19.790 --> 00:20:21.530
He committed suicide by drinking poison.

357
00:20:21.790 --> 00:20:26.130
As the Romans crossed to his home in 181 at the age of 66,

358
00:20:26.370 --> 00:20:30.010
Carthage itself only outlived its greatest son by 35 years,

359
00:20:30.230 --> 00:20:35.200
the Romans went to war with Carthage a third time in 146 BC capturing the city

360
00:20:35.620 --> 00:20:38.360
and burning it to the ground. It's difficult to overstate.

361
00:20:38.380 --> 00:20:40.560
The impact Hannibal has on world history.

362
00:20:40.780 --> 00:20:45.000
His campaign was the last serious threat posed to the Roman Republic by an

363
00:20:45.160 --> 00:20:45.993
external invader.

364
00:20:46.180 --> 00:20:49.600
It would go on to become one of the greatest empires in world history.

365
00:20:49.740 --> 00:20:53.240
The lessons learned against Hannibal were surely influential in that as their

366
00:20:53.390 --> 00:20:57.240
militia army that had been beaten by Hannibal was transformed into a

367
00:20:57.241 --> 00:21:01.280
professional force that defeated every opponent they faced when they weren't

368
00:21:01.320 --> 00:21:04.040
fighting each other. Hannibal became a bogie man for every Roman.

369
00:21:04.270 --> 00:21:07.270
When calamity would strike a Roman citizen in a common term,

370
00:21:07.310 --> 00:21:09.550
a phrase was Hannibal, is it the gates?

371
00:21:09.800 --> 00:21:12.750
Hannibal's tactics were revolutionary for the time period.

372
00:21:12.850 --> 00:21:15.630
He lived in over the course of the next 2,200 years.

373
00:21:15.880 --> 00:21:19.790
Every great commander studied Hannibal, including Napoleon Bonna heart,

374
00:21:20.310 --> 00:21:21.990
Julia Caesar, and Robert E. Lee.

375
00:21:22.170 --> 00:21:24.870
His tactics are still taught in military academies to date.

376
00:21:25.130 --> 00:21:29.660
His victory at cane in particular is cited as a true masterpiece of

377
00:21:29.860 --> 00:21:32.380
military strategy being the perfect battle.

378
00:21:32.840 --> 00:21:36.060
How much would things have been different at Hannibal's invasion gone

379
00:21:36.061 --> 00:21:37.020
differently? Well,

380
00:21:37.021 --> 00:21:41.380
there's no way to know for sure that there is no doubt that he stands as one of

381
00:21:41.381 --> 00:21:43.100
the most talented, audacious,

382
00:21:43.440 --> 00:21:46.780
and truly great military leaders of not just the ancient world,

383
00:21:47.590 --> 00:21:51.050
