This video is made possible by brilliant.

00:00:10.161 --> 00:00:12.600
You're gonna learn more about brilliant later in today's video,

4
00:00:12.700 --> 00:00:14.680
but if you'd like to learn more about them right now,

5
00:00:14.880 --> 00:00:17.920
and why wouldn't you go to brilliant at org forward slash biographics?

6
00:00:17.921 --> 00:00:20.280
There is also a link in the description below.

7
00:00:20.690 --> 00:00:23.990
So today we are gonna look at the life of a man who is regarded as one of

8
00:00:23.991 --> 00:00:27.790
history's greatest inventors, Alexander Graham, bell inexorably.

9
00:00:27.791 --> 00:00:29.110
He is linked with the telephone.

10
00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:33.230
Although we will see that he works on everything from wireless technology and

11
00:00:33.231 --> 00:00:37.030
sound recorders to planes, boats, and even a metal attacker.

12
00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:39.190
His career was not with our controversy though.

13
00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:43.100
He had to face almost 600 lawsuits in his lifetime. Also,

14
00:00:43.160 --> 00:00:46.140
was he really the inventor of the telephone or was he just someone who stole

15
00:00:46.270 --> 00:00:48.660
ideas and just sent better lawyers? Father,

16
00:00:48.720 --> 00:00:52.660
was he the champion of deaf people or did his efforts do more harm than good?

17
00:00:53.060 --> 00:00:55.980
Well, neither of these questions can be honestly answered with certainty.

18
00:00:56.000 --> 00:01:00.100
So those might be decisions that you are gonna have to make for yourself after

19
00:01:00.101 --> 00:01:04.650
you've finished watching this video and let's get into it. Shall we?

20
00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:14.370
Alexander Bell was born on March 3rd, 1847 in Edinburgh,

21
00:01:14.530 --> 00:01:18.330
Scotland to Alexander Melville, bell and Eliza Grace Simmons.

22
00:01:18.590 --> 00:01:21.130
He had two older brothers Melville and Edwards,

23
00:01:21.131 --> 00:01:23.560
but unfortunately they both died of tuberculosis.

24
00:01:23.750 --> 00:01:28.200
When bell was a young adult originally, he was simply just named Alexander,

25
00:01:28.300 --> 00:01:31.960
but the young bell, he wanted a middle name, like his two older brothers,

26
00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:34.800
his father relented, and on his love birthday,

27
00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:38.120
he gifted them the middle name of Graham after Alexander Graham.

28
00:01:38.121 --> 00:01:41.600
One of his father's former students and family, friends from a young age,

29
00:01:42.280 --> 00:01:45.710
Alexander Graham bell. He showed great interest in studying speech and fanatics.

30
00:01:45.711 --> 00:01:47.110
This was not super surprising.

31
00:01:47.111 --> 00:01:50.870
Seeing as his father and grandfather were both phoneticians.

32
00:01:51.170 --> 00:01:54.990
His father was a professor who wrote several seminal works on the subject and

33
00:01:54.991 --> 00:01:57.710
developed a phonetic alphabet called visible speech.

34
00:01:57.760 --> 00:02:02.470
There was also a personal motivation for bell as his mother and later his wife

35
00:02:02.620 --> 00:02:06.860
were both death. Allegedly Bell's first invention came at the tender age of 12.

36
00:02:07.040 --> 00:02:10.780
He was playing with a friend whose family owned a flower mill and noticed how

37
00:02:10.781 --> 00:02:12.660
long it took to husk the grain.

38
00:02:12.680 --> 00:02:17.220
He then built a machine which used rotating paddles and nail brushes to speed

39
00:02:17.270 --> 00:02:18.580
along the laborious process.

40
00:02:18.890 --> 00:02:22.580
Another notable episode in the development of young Bell's scientific interest

41
00:02:22.640 --> 00:02:27.290
was when his took him and his brothers to see a talking automaton based on the

42
00:02:27.291 --> 00:02:29.530
mechanical Turk, which had been lost in a fire.

43
00:02:29.710 --> 00:02:32.850
The Turk built a hundred years prior by Hungarian inventor.

44
00:02:33.370 --> 00:02:37.490
Wolfgang V Kein was a sensation in its day purportedly.

45
00:02:37.491 --> 00:02:41.010
It was a mechanical device that could play chess on its own against human

46
00:02:41.250 --> 00:02:44.760
opponents. Notable statesmen, such as Ben Franklin Napoleon,

47
00:02:44.761 --> 00:02:47.720
both keen chess players were bested by the machine.

48
00:02:48.200 --> 00:02:51.320
Although the Turk was an amazing creation, capable of impressive movements.

49
00:02:51.380 --> 00:02:54.720
One thing it could not do was play chess. In that regard,

50
00:02:54.860 --> 00:02:59.560
the Turk was a hoax for inside the machine was room for a human chess master

51
00:02:59.700 --> 00:03:02.200
who actually controlled the automatons, moves

52
00:03:08.380 --> 00:03:11.680
The death of Bell's brothers who came in short order just three years apart

53
00:03:11.770 --> 00:03:14.600
after bell himself, and his father also suffered health scares.

54
00:03:14.601 --> 00:03:17.840
The family decided to leave the big city and moved to a quiet place in Canada

55
00:03:17.841 --> 00:03:21.710
because it had a healthier climate. They settled on Braford Ontario,

56
00:03:21.840 --> 00:03:26.550
where the bell homestead still stands as a natural historic site in museum bell

57
00:03:26.551 --> 00:03:29.630
set up a workshop to continue his studies and to speech and sound,

58
00:03:29.690 --> 00:03:33.750
but also began traveling to Massachusetts and Connecticut to teach his father's

59
00:03:33.990 --> 00:03:36.270
visible speech system, to schools for the deaf.

60
00:03:36.410 --> 00:03:40.380
He worked as a teacher for the next few years for Boston university,

61
00:03:40.440 --> 00:03:44.740
and then in his own private practice. During this time he met 15 year old pupil,

62
00:03:45.380 --> 00:03:47.060
Mabel Hubbard, and fell in love with her.

63
00:03:47.160 --> 00:03:51.180
Her father got a green Hubbard was a wealthy influential man in Massachusetts

64
00:03:51.320 --> 00:03:54.940
who funded some of Bell's research. He and his partner, Thomas Sanders,

65
00:03:55.080 --> 00:03:57.660
who also had a deaf child suited by bell,

66
00:03:57.661 --> 00:04:00.730
wanted to secure patents related you Telegraph technology.

67
00:04:00.870 --> 00:04:04.370
So they financed Bell's work. Perfecting the harmonic Telegraph,

68
00:04:04.560 --> 00:04:08.610
such a system allowed multiple messages to be transmitted simultaneously over a

69
00:04:08.611 --> 00:04:09.690
single Telegraph. Why?

70
00:04:09.870 --> 00:04:13.130
And it was this research that led bell to invent the telephone

71
00:04:19.350 --> 00:04:21.080
On March the 10 and 1376,

72
00:04:21.920 --> 00:04:24.480
Alexander Gray and bell uttered the first words into a telephone.

73
00:04:24.550 --> 00:04:27.520
They were Mr. Watson, come here. I want to see you.

74
00:04:27.700 --> 00:04:31.440
His assistant walked into his office and the two swapped places with bell. Now,

75
00:04:31.441 --> 00:04:32.230
listening to Watson,

76
00:04:32.230 --> 00:04:36.440
read a few passages from a book bell noted that he could definitely hear loud

77
00:04:36.441 --> 00:04:37.480
articulate sounds,

78
00:04:37.540 --> 00:04:42.390
but that they were indistinct and muffled journal added a bit of contention

79
00:04:42.391 --> 00:04:44.150
to the first proceedings. First off,

80
00:04:44.151 --> 00:04:48.950
he noted the famous sentence to be Mr. Watson, come here. I want you not.

81
00:04:49.270 --> 00:04:50.150
I want to see you.

82
00:04:50.290 --> 00:04:54.150
He also claims that these words were not merely a test of the telephone,

83
00:04:54.151 --> 00:04:56.990
but rather a cry for helpers. When he entered Bell's office,

84
00:04:57.050 --> 00:05:00.430
he discovered that the inventor had accidentally spilled battery acid on his

85
00:05:00.431 --> 00:05:01.130
clothes.

86
00:05:01.130 --> 00:05:06.020
This story was later debunked by Watson's own great-granddaughter as a ation

87
00:05:06.021 --> 00:05:08.340
of her forefather that he made our decades.

88
00:05:08.390 --> 00:05:12.380
After the fact three days prior to this bell was awarded patent number

89
00:05:13.700 --> 00:05:16.940
174,000 four hundred and sixty five four improvement telegraphy,

90
00:05:16.941 --> 00:05:21.810
which would become one of the most valuable and most controversial patents in

91
00:05:21.970 --> 00:05:23.170
American history garden.

92
00:05:23.450 --> 00:05:27.690
The green Hubbard set up bell telephone as a joint stock company to look after

93
00:05:27.691 --> 00:05:32.610
their interests and split 5,000 shares of the company between four people, him,

94
00:05:33.040 --> 00:05:36.610
bell, Thomas Watson, and Thomas Sanders on a personal level.

95
00:05:36.611 --> 00:05:39.490
Alexander Graham bell was soon to be a rich man.

96
00:05:39.491 --> 00:05:42.560
As he owned around 1,500 shares at the company. Finally,

97
00:05:42.920 --> 00:05:45.080
Gardner hub consented to him marrying his daughter,

98
00:05:45.250 --> 00:05:49.880
Mabel the death pupil that bell to and fell in love with a few years back on

99
00:05:49.881 --> 00:05:51.280
July, the 11th, 1877,

100
00:05:51.281 --> 00:05:55.400
just a few days after the bell telephone company was founded Mabel and Alexander

101
00:05:55.620 --> 00:05:59.880
or Alec as she called him, tied the knot to show his love and trust bell,

102
00:05:59.900 --> 00:06:03.760
gifted Mabel, all but 10 shares in his company as a wedding present.

103
00:06:10.100 --> 00:06:14.360
So now we arrive at the most contentious and controversial aspect of Bell's

104
00:06:14.361 --> 00:06:14.900
legacy.

105
00:06:14.900 --> 00:06:19.270
Did he really invent the tele or did he steal his idea and make a fortune

106
00:06:20.030 --> 00:06:22.590
of others? And the answer really has to be a resounding.

107
00:06:23.080 --> 00:06:27.990
We're not sure the topic has been fiercely debated for almost 150 years and has

108
00:06:27.991 --> 00:06:31.070
been the subject of books and hundreds of lawsuits.

109
00:06:31.071 --> 00:06:34.510
Everybody has an opinion on it, but it is far from a settled matter.

110
00:06:34.860 --> 00:06:37.780
When it comes to complicated inventions, like the telephone,

111
00:06:37.850 --> 00:06:40.260
they are often the result of the work of multiple people.

112
00:06:40.470 --> 00:06:44.500
Oftentimes credit ends up going to the person who makes the most practical or

113
00:06:44.501 --> 00:06:48.260
best working version rather than the one who originated it.

114
00:06:48.330 --> 00:06:52.140
History also tends to have a shorter attention span and attributes the work of

115
00:06:52.290 --> 00:06:57.100
many to the work of one for the sake of brevity. It is certainly not fair,

116
00:06:57.530 --> 00:07:01.530
but it is what tends to happen apart from be there were other inventors who had

117
00:07:01.531 --> 00:07:05.410
substantial claims to the telephone Italian Antonio MUCI built a device

118
00:07:05.411 --> 00:07:08.930
described as an electromagnetic telephone decades before bell.

119
00:07:08.950 --> 00:07:10.410
He kept on improving its,

120
00:07:10.530 --> 00:07:14.010
but never found the money needed to finance his invention in 1871.

121
00:07:14.011 --> 00:07:17.730
He didn't even have the funding necessary to take out patents for his Teletrac

122
00:07:17.890 --> 00:07:20.800
phone. Was he dubbed it? Instead, he filed a caveat,

123
00:07:21.240 --> 00:07:24.320
an official notice that a patent will be filed at a later date.

124
00:07:24.500 --> 00:07:27.800
It was much cheaper, but also needed to be renewed annually.

125
00:07:27.801 --> 00:07:29.880
Something which he stopped doing in 1874.

126
00:07:29.940 --> 00:07:31.920
He tried to obtain funding from Western union,

127
00:07:32.180 --> 00:07:33.760
but not only did they turn him down,

128
00:07:33.761 --> 00:07:38.040
they later claimed to have lost the proprietary materials that he sent them Muhi

129
00:07:38.041 --> 00:07:39.230
and be went to court.

130
00:07:39.510 --> 00:07:42.350
And at first things seemed to go in the Italian inventor's favor.

131
00:07:42.570 --> 00:07:45.950
The Supreme court agreed to hear the case and fraud charges were filed against

132
00:07:46.100 --> 00:07:50.550
bell. However, mutually died in 1889 and his case died with him.

133
00:07:50.760 --> 00:07:54.310
Italy of course always considered Antonio mutually to be the rightful inventor

134
00:07:54.311 --> 00:07:56.270
of the telephone, but in 2002,

135
00:07:56.450 --> 00:08:00.260
so did the United States house of representatives passed a resolution which

136
00:08:00.261 --> 00:08:04.540
honored MU's work and specified that had he continued to pay the fee for his

137
00:08:04.541 --> 00:08:05.280
caveat.

138
00:08:05.280 --> 00:08:09.220
No patents could have been issued to bell a few days later to show support for

139
00:08:09.221 --> 00:08:11.420
their guy. The Canadian parliament passed a motion,

140
00:08:11.690 --> 00:08:14.700
reaffirming Alexander Graham bell, as the inventor of the telephone.

141
00:08:14.800 --> 00:08:17.140
The story of Elisha gray is much better known to the public.

142
00:08:17.280 --> 00:08:21.250
It was a race to the patent office between him and bell as they created their

143
00:08:21.251 --> 00:08:23.250
versions of the telephones around the same time,

144
00:08:23.390 --> 00:08:27.570
the Scottish inventor beat gray by a few hours and therefore secured his spot in

145
00:08:27.571 --> 00:08:31.210
the history books. While Elijah gray just became a footnote gray,

146
00:08:31.240 --> 00:08:34.770
like bell was working on the harmonic Telegraph with funding from Western union.

147
00:08:35.030 --> 00:08:39.330
He developed a device that could transmit musical tones using vibrating reads in

148
00:08:39.450 --> 00:08:42.760
1870, but did not follow through on it immediately. Over a year later,

149
00:08:42.980 --> 00:08:46.600
he finally drew a diagram of his device and had his lawyer file a caveat out

150
00:08:46.601 --> 00:08:49.960
with a patent office on February the 14th, 1876. Of course,

151
00:08:49.961 --> 00:08:50.840
by then it was too late.

152
00:08:50.860 --> 00:08:54.160
As Bell's lawyer had already submitted his patents to the office.

153
00:08:54.620 --> 00:08:56.800
And of course a legal battle ensued.

154
00:08:56.801 --> 00:08:59.840
There were even accusations that bell stole ideas from gray,

155
00:08:59.841 --> 00:09:02.640
particularly as designed for a liquid transmitter.

156
00:09:02.660 --> 00:09:07.320
The most egregious claim came courtesy of patent examiner, Zenni, FIS Wilber,

157
00:09:07.321 --> 00:09:11.520
who confessed that he was bribed to show Gray's caveat to bell in his lawyer.

158
00:09:12.280 --> 00:09:12.690
Marcellas Bailey,

159
00:09:12.690 --> 00:09:17.670
which he did because he was heavily in debt to Bailey bell obviously denied all

160
00:09:17.671 --> 00:09:18.790
charges of wrongdoing.

161
00:09:18.791 --> 00:09:23.030
And the fact that Wilber was an alcoholic and that given conflicting affidavits

162
00:09:23.100 --> 00:09:24.830
sunk is credibility in the end,

163
00:09:24.850 --> 00:09:28.870
the court sided with bell and subsequently upheld his patterns in hundreds of

164
00:09:28.871 --> 00:09:31.470
other lawsuits. So now just before we continue with today's video,

165
00:09:31.510 --> 00:09:34.190
I do wanna tell you a bit about today's sponsor brilliance, brilliant,

166
00:09:34.510 --> 00:09:36.660
believe that learning math, science, and computer science,

167
00:09:36.680 --> 00:09:38.980
it doesn't have to be dull to that end.

168
00:09:38.980 --> 00:09:41.980
They've put together courses that are all about storytelling,

169
00:09:41.981 --> 00:09:44.540
interactive challenges and solving problems.

170
00:09:44.610 --> 00:09:47.860
It's a really hands on approach that is an excellent way to learn.

171
00:09:48.380 --> 00:09:51.580
And currently, by the way, they've got over 50 interactive courses available.

172
00:09:51.920 --> 00:09:54.380
So look, you're watching a video about an inventor,

173
00:09:54.381 --> 00:09:58.050
so you're already probably the cur type and brilliant can be a great way to take

174
00:09:58.051 --> 00:10:02.450
that curiosity just a step further and understand the world even more.

175
00:10:02.710 --> 00:10:04.930
For example, there's a course on scientific thinking,

176
00:10:04.931 --> 00:10:08.970
allowing you to get a solid foundation in physics while just doing some puzzles,

177
00:10:09.170 --> 00:10:10.003
a great way to learn.

178
00:10:10.410 --> 00:10:14.370
You'll get to understand the physics of mirror reflections and laser tag and who

179
00:10:14.371 --> 00:10:16.280
doesn't love laser tag, and much,

180
00:10:16.281 --> 00:10:19.800
much more so effective learning is all about problem solving and brilliant help

181
00:10:19.801 --> 00:10:23.640
you learn and practice that. It's just a great compliment to videos like this.

182
00:10:23.900 --> 00:10:25.480
And it's all good to learn stuff here,

183
00:10:25.481 --> 00:10:28.280
but you can just take it that step deeper on brilliant.

184
00:10:28.540 --> 00:10:32.120
So if you want to support biographics and get unlimited access to all of

185
00:10:32.320 --> 00:10:34.440
brilliant in depth, maths and science courses,

186
00:10:34.790 --> 00:10:39.430
just head over to brilliant do slash biographics to get 20% off their premium

187
00:10:39.570 --> 00:10:42.430
annual subscription, and let's get back to it.

188
00:10:48.700 --> 00:10:51.990
Another challenger to bell and his telephone was Western union,

189
00:10:51.991 --> 00:10:55.670
which at the time was the largest communications company in the world in what is

190
00:10:55.671 --> 00:10:58.820
widely regarded as one of the business decisions of all time.

191
00:10:58.821 --> 00:11:02.300
Western union turned down the opportunity to buy the patent for the telephone

192
00:11:02.301 --> 00:11:03.500
for any a hundred thousand dollars.

193
00:11:03.730 --> 00:11:05.900
When the technology was in its infancy company,

194
00:11:05.901 --> 00:11:07.900
president William Morton bulked at the idea,

195
00:11:07.960 --> 00:11:10.660
seeing the new device as just a toy,

196
00:11:10.760 --> 00:11:14.260
he considered the telephone in practical and believed that no one would prefer

197
00:11:14.261 --> 00:11:17.970
it over the Telegraph. He was wrong. You knew that. And just two years later,

198
00:11:17.990 --> 00:11:20.090
the company valued the patent at 25 million

199
00:11:22.680 --> 00:11:23.500
Western union,

200
00:11:23.500 --> 00:11:27.450
tried to get into the game and task Thomas Edison to build an improved device

201
00:11:27.451 --> 00:11:29.370
that they could patents. The two companies,

202
00:11:29.371 --> 00:11:33.130
they went to court and Western union lost badly. In the end,

203
00:11:33.131 --> 00:11:36.690
it surrendered all telephone related patents and agreed to pull out of the

204
00:11:36.810 --> 00:11:39.920
business entirely and changed for a few minor concessions.

205
00:11:40.140 --> 00:11:43.240
It was at this time that Thomas Edison provided his own contribution to the

206
00:11:43.360 --> 00:11:45.080
telephone one, which is still around today.

207
00:11:45.390 --> 00:11:49.080
Long after the patents have expired and the technology has become obsolete.

208
00:11:49.220 --> 00:11:52.040
And this was the fact that he popularized the greeting. Hello.

209
00:11:52.460 --> 00:11:54.080
Now the word did exist in the world before,

210
00:11:54.081 --> 00:11:57.680
but it was typically used as an exclamation, for example, hello,

211
00:11:57.740 --> 00:12:01.280
what's going on in here. If we were up to Alexander Gray and bell, even today,

212
00:12:01.300 --> 00:12:03.360
we would be answering our phones by saying

213
00:12:10.580 --> 00:12:14.510
In 1880 bell used his money to establi the V laboratory in Washington,

214
00:12:14.770 --> 00:12:18.550
DC and continue research into sound technologies. In 1887,

215
00:12:18.570 --> 00:12:22.590
he founded and funded the V bureau whose goal was to help deaf people.

216
00:12:22.990 --> 00:12:26.510
It later emerged with a different Def related organization of which bell was

217
00:12:26.511 --> 00:12:27.344
also president.

218
00:12:27.370 --> 00:12:31.590
And today it is known as the Alexander Graham bell association for the death and

219
00:12:31.591 --> 00:12:34.300
heart of hearing or simp the ag bell.

220
00:12:34.520 --> 00:12:37.660
The original building is still around serving as headquarters for the

221
00:12:37.661 --> 00:12:40.860
institution and is listed as a national historic landmark.

222
00:12:40.870 --> 00:12:43.460
Given how much bell revolutionized oral communication.

223
00:12:43.520 --> 00:12:47.100
It was thought a shame that we had no idea what he actually sounded like.

224
00:12:47.160 --> 00:12:49.940
Indeed. It was thought that there were no recordings of him that survived,

225
00:12:49.941 --> 00:12:52.020
but that changed in 2013,

226
00:12:52.200 --> 00:12:56.410
the Smithsonian institu found an old wax and cardboard rack or from the vault

227
00:12:56.460 --> 00:12:57.230
laboratory.

228
00:12:57.230 --> 00:13:00.970
And researchers were able to recover the audio it's over four and a half minutes

229
00:13:01.070 --> 00:13:04.330
of bell reading various numbers and dollar figures fittingly.

230
00:13:04.331 --> 00:13:05.210
It ends with the words

231
00:13:14.950 --> 00:13:16.560
With all the work he did with deaf people.

232
00:13:16.620 --> 00:13:19.680
You would think that bell would be regarded as a hero in the community,

233
00:13:19.820 --> 00:13:22.120
but actually he's quite a controversial figure.

234
00:13:22.340 --> 00:13:25.680
He had some strong views about how the condition should be approached,

235
00:13:25.681 --> 00:13:28.960
which involved keeping deaf people apart from one another and completely

236
00:13:28.961 --> 00:13:32.560
eliminating sign language bell considered the only proper way to teach deaf

237
00:13:32.561 --> 00:13:37.070
people was through oralism communi through the use of speech and lip reading.

238
00:13:37.290 --> 00:13:40.070
He regarded sign language as a foreign language one,

239
00:13:40.071 --> 00:13:41.950
which had no place in the United States.

240
00:13:42.010 --> 00:13:44.030
And he tried to have it removed from schools.

241
00:13:44.470 --> 00:13:48.830
Moreover me wrote a paper called upon the formation of a deaf variety of the

242
00:13:48.831 --> 00:13:49.351
human race,

243
00:13:49.351 --> 00:13:53.510
which warns of an upcoming calamity involving the creation of a deaf race.

244
00:13:53.690 --> 00:13:57.020
He believed that deaf people all should not socialize with each other because

245
00:13:57.021 --> 00:14:01.020
socialization leads to marriage, which leads to children who will also be deaf.

246
00:14:01.130 --> 00:14:04.420
This all fell in line with his advocacy of eugenics.

247
00:14:04.480 --> 00:14:07.380
He believe the practice could be used to improve human breeding.

248
00:14:07.540 --> 00:14:11.140
Although he never went so far as to suggest that the government should impose

249
00:14:11.200 --> 00:14:13.060
any kind of controls on reproduction.

250
00:14:13.330 --> 00:14:16.690
Instead he wanted the elements that promoted death into marriages to be

251
00:14:17.050 --> 00:14:18.450
identified and eliminated.

252
00:14:18.760 --> 00:14:22.610
Just like with the telephone bells work with the death left behind a tainted

253
00:14:23.010 --> 00:14:23.850
factious legacy

254
00:14:30.470 --> 00:14:32.850
On July, the second 1881 United States,

255
00:14:32.851 --> 00:14:37.040
president James Garfield was getting ready to leave Washington DC for his summer

256
00:14:37.240 --> 00:14:39.920
vacation at the Baltimore and Patto Mac railroad station.

257
00:14:39.980 --> 00:14:44.040
He was approached by a disgruntled supporter and office seeker who shot at him

258
00:14:44.041 --> 00:14:48.320
with a bulldog revolver from point blank range while one bullets only grazed

259
00:14:48.321 --> 00:14:51.560
Garfield. The other hit him in the back and got lodged inside his body.

260
00:14:51.740 --> 00:14:55.960
The president died 80 days later after his doctors proved unable to locate and

261
00:14:55.961 --> 00:14:59.400
extract the bullet. Despite some assistance from Alexander Graham bell,

262
00:14:59.420 --> 00:15:00.360
the murderer was Charles.

263
00:15:01.080 --> 00:15:04.560
Jacobo a man who conatively thought he was doing the Republican party a favor by

264
00:15:04.561 --> 00:15:05.680
getting rid of Garfield.

265
00:15:05.780 --> 00:15:09.680
And who also believed that he was being commanded by God modern medical

266
00:15:09.681 --> 00:15:14.630
professionals of diagnosed GTO of likely being a narcissistic schizophrenic

267
00:15:14.631 --> 00:15:16.990
with delusions of Grande. But even in his time,

268
00:15:16.991 --> 00:15:19.790
talk of his mental health was a hot topic among alienists.

269
00:15:19.900 --> 00:15:21.870
They were very keen to examine his brain,

270
00:15:21.871 --> 00:15:26.070
which is still on display in the main hall of the mu museum in Philadelphia,

271
00:15:26.150 --> 00:15:26.970
neurologists,

272
00:15:26.970 --> 00:15:31.660
Edward Charles Spitz testified at GTO's trial and said that he offered from

273
00:15:31.661 --> 00:15:35.340
moral insanity, something. We would likely call sociopathy today.

274
00:15:35.400 --> 00:15:37.020
Coincidentally, the doctor's son,

275
00:15:37.260 --> 00:15:39.420
Anthony Spitzer followed in his father's footsteps.

276
00:15:39.421 --> 00:15:43.020
And 20 years later would perform the autopsy of the next presidential assassin.

277
00:15:43.170 --> 00:15:48.140
Leon sagos who killed William McKinley in 1901 during his life Gito

278
00:15:48.141 --> 00:15:52.730
jumped on many bandwagons. His latest was a Republican fact called the Starwars.

279
00:15:52.731 --> 00:15:56.530
During the 1880 election. He wrote a rambling speech in support of Garfield,

280
00:15:56.531 --> 00:16:00.330
which he was allowed to deliver once in front of a small crowd in New York city,

281
00:16:00.470 --> 00:16:03.250
it was less than nothing, but in Kato's mind,

282
00:16:03.310 --> 00:16:05.970
his speech was crucial to helping Garfield win the election.

283
00:16:06.060 --> 00:16:09.330
Afterwards Gato started roaming the halls of the white house and state

284
00:16:09.331 --> 00:16:12.320
departments, badgering, anyone. He would listen about his deserved ward.

285
00:16:12.500 --> 00:16:16.080
He wanted a diplomatic post Paris or maybe Vienna. Of course,

286
00:16:16.081 --> 00:16:17.280
nobody took him seriously.

287
00:16:17.281 --> 00:16:20.960
And eventually secretary of state James Blaine told him in no uncertain terms to

288
00:16:20.961 --> 00:16:22.920
go away and never bother him again.

289
00:16:23.070 --> 00:16:26.800
This launch GTO on his downward spiral of madness in his mind,

290
00:16:26.820 --> 00:16:28.440
he needed to get rid of Blaine,

291
00:16:28.441 --> 00:16:31.320
which obviously could only have been achieved by killing the president.

292
00:16:31.700 --> 00:16:35.750
His delusion was so great that during his trial Gato believed that he would be

293
00:16:35.751 --> 00:16:39.670
acquitted because the American people would rise up and demand his release when

294
00:16:39.790 --> 00:16:41.150
the didn't happen. And he was convicted,

295
00:16:41.210 --> 00:16:44.150
he was still convinced that new United States, president Chester,

296
00:16:44.350 --> 00:16:46.910
a Arthur would pardon him, going back to Garfield.

297
00:16:47.010 --> 00:16:50.390
His injuries and treatment are still discussed in medical circles today,

298
00:16:50.391 --> 00:16:52.950
almost 140 years later, specifically,

299
00:16:53.060 --> 00:16:56.660
people talk about how the presidents was as much of a victim of medical

300
00:16:56.661 --> 00:16:59.340
incompetence as he was of an assassination attempt.

301
00:16:59.340 --> 00:17:03.020
Perhaps one of these Sans things that Kato said during his trial was that the

302
00:17:03.021 --> 00:17:04.100
doctors killed Garfield.

303
00:17:04.660 --> 00:17:08.340
I just shot him as he was later revealed the mystery bullet lodged itself and

304
00:17:08.341 --> 00:17:11.460
the president's soft tissue nowadays finding it would be trivial.

305
00:17:11.560 --> 00:17:15.090
And the patient would've been on the men and outta the hospital in just a few

306
00:17:15.091 --> 00:17:17.210
days, however, even in his time Garfield,

307
00:17:17.211 --> 00:17:20.690
would've had a more decent shot at survival with the more competent medical

308
00:17:20.860 --> 00:17:21.530
staff,

309
00:17:21.530 --> 00:17:25.050
a lot of the blame rests on the man who self appointed himself as white house

310
00:17:25.051 --> 00:17:28.410
physician. He was Dr. Dr. Willard bliss and yes,

311
00:17:28.430 --> 00:17:31.730
his first name really was Dr. By that time British surgeon,

312
00:17:32.090 --> 00:17:35.520
Joseph Lister was already telling physicians do wash their hands and sterilize

313
00:17:35.521 --> 00:17:36.960
equipment to prevent infections.

314
00:17:36.961 --> 00:17:39.920
But the idea had not yet been accepted across the ponds,

315
00:17:39.921 --> 00:17:43.840
therefore BLIS and over a dozen other doctors routinely stuck their unclean

316
00:17:43.841 --> 00:17:45.760
fingers inside Garfield's wounds,

317
00:17:45.780 --> 00:17:50.240
trying to locate the pu this led to infections and eventually sepsis, moreover,

318
00:17:50.241 --> 00:17:54.360
the president lost almost 80 pounds during his hospitalization due to a diet

319
00:17:54.680 --> 00:17:58.840
prescribed Vilis, which was very non-nutritious and heavy on morphine.

320
00:17:59.190 --> 00:18:02.400
When bill heard that the president was shot and the doctors couldn't find the

321
00:18:02.401 --> 00:18:05.280
bullet, he went to work on a device that could detect hidden metal.

322
00:18:05.500 --> 00:18:07.760
He called it an induction balance device,

323
00:18:07.761 --> 00:18:11.790
and it was based on an earlier invention by French electrical engineer,

324
00:18:11.930 --> 00:18:16.350
Gustav trove bell tested this on civil war veterans who had bullets still lodged

325
00:18:16.351 --> 00:18:19.910
in their bodies and found that his device was only sometimes successful.

326
00:18:20.010 --> 00:18:22.750
Bell's invention had a large battery with a condenser,

327
00:18:22.870 --> 00:18:26.750
a wooden control O which was passed over the patient's body and a telephone

328
00:18:26.751 --> 00:18:30.220
receiver, which he kept to his ear to listen for the sound of metal.

329
00:18:30.780 --> 00:18:34.580
Bel first tried to use his induction balance machine, non Garfield in late July.

330
00:18:34.600 --> 00:18:36.180
He assembled the device on site,

331
00:18:36.200 --> 00:18:40.140
but all he heard coming out of the receiver was a strange sputtering noise.

332
00:18:40.280 --> 00:18:43.860
He failed to locate the bullet, but later concluded that in his haste,

333
00:18:43.861 --> 00:18:47.780
he made mistakes while constructing the device bell returns on August the first

334
00:18:47.880 --> 00:18:49.180
and tried his test again,

335
00:18:49.181 --> 00:18:52.090
but still failed to pinpoint the location of the bullet.

336
00:18:52.350 --> 00:18:53.690
He went back to the drawing board,

337
00:18:53.950 --> 00:18:56.930
but he never got a chance to try the metal detector. Again,

338
00:18:56.931 --> 00:19:00.610
president Garfield died on September the 19th of sepsis,

339
00:19:00.870 --> 00:19:05.290
and emaciation now there's still plenty of discussion regarding the reason why

340
00:19:05.390 --> 00:19:06.450
Bell's device failed.

341
00:19:06.550 --> 00:19:11.080
The most common story in circulation puts the blame on thence from the

342
00:19:11.081 --> 00:19:14.600
president's mattress, which was made of steel wires. However,

343
00:19:14.860 --> 00:19:18.320
in a report bell expressed his belief that the bullet was too deep inside the

344
00:19:18.321 --> 00:19:20.960
body to be picked up by his metal detector. Dr.

345
00:19:21.360 --> 00:19:25.280
Doctor has also been accused of only allowing bell to check the president's

346
00:19:25.520 --> 00:19:28.840
right side, because he was convinced that that was where the bullet was located.

347
00:19:29.240 --> 00:19:31.550
An autopsy though proved him wrong.

348
00:19:37.810 --> 00:19:41.590
The telephone brought bell fame and fortune and working with the deaf was his

349
00:19:41.591 --> 00:19:42.290
true passion,

350
00:19:42.290 --> 00:19:46.790
but he was a scientist of many interests who had dozens of patents in other

351
00:19:46.880 --> 00:19:48.910
areas alongside Charles, some Tainter.

352
00:19:48.911 --> 00:19:52.780
He created an improved version of the fall ground dubbed the grapho phone.

353
00:19:52.890 --> 00:19:56.660
They set up a new business for this invention called the V grapho phone company.

354
00:19:57.000 --> 00:20:00.700
It later merged with another company which evolved into what is today known as

355
00:20:00.940 --> 00:20:02.780
Columbia records, even more impressive.

356
00:20:02.781 --> 00:20:05.580
The two created a primitive version of a wireless telephone.

357
00:20:05.581 --> 00:20:07.140
That bell called a photo phone.

358
00:20:07.440 --> 00:20:11.970
He used it to transmit an audio message detained her over 650 feet away in an

359
00:20:11.971 --> 00:20:14.810
interview. Bell called this his greatest achievement, though.

360
00:20:14.830 --> 00:20:19.010
It wouldn't be until the arrival of fiber optics that such a technology would

361
00:20:19.011 --> 00:20:20.250
become truly useful.

362
00:20:20.360 --> 00:20:24.410
Bell also served as the second president of the national geographic society and

363
00:20:24.411 --> 00:20:28.290
helped turn it into one of the largest nonprofit scientific organizations in the

364
00:20:28.291 --> 00:20:32.720
world. He was an arts as is sometimes stated among the original 33. He found us,

365
00:20:33.040 --> 00:20:34.520
although his father-in-law garden,

366
00:20:34.680 --> 00:20:38.560
a green Hubbard Watts perhaps most surprising involved was his work in

367
00:20:38.630 --> 00:20:39.380
aeronautics.

368
00:20:39.380 --> 00:20:43.520
He founded the aerial experiment association with like-minded individuals,

369
00:20:43.521 --> 00:20:46.960
such as aviators, Glen Curtis, and Thomas Selfridge together.

370
00:20:47.040 --> 00:20:48.720
They designed and built the silver dart,

371
00:20:48.721 --> 00:20:53.080
which in 1909 made the first powered flight in Canada from planes belt,

372
00:20:53.090 --> 00:20:55.400
moved onto boats with engineer Casey Baldwin.

373
00:20:55.401 --> 00:20:59.880
He built a hydro profile boat dubbed the HD four on September the ninth of 1919.

374
00:21:00.040 --> 00:21:03.040
It set the new boat speed record at 61.58 knots.

375
00:21:03.070 --> 00:21:06.400
Both of these flights occurred at the bras or lake in Nova Scotia,

376
00:21:06.590 --> 00:21:10.190
a near Bell's estate, where he spent the last three decades of his life.

377
00:21:10.410 --> 00:21:12.670
As you can see, Bell's career was full of innovation.

378
00:21:12.860 --> 00:21:16.670
Long after the telephone came into being the HD war turned down to be his last

379
00:21:16.671 --> 00:21:20.630
taste of greatness. As bell died a few years later in 1922,

380
00:21:20.850 --> 00:21:22.670
he left behind a legacy that is short,

381
00:21:22.900 --> 00:21:27.380
stir up mixed emotions and ill elicit ding reactions from different people.

382
