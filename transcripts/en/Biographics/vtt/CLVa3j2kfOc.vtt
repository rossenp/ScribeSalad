5
00:00:18.180 --> 00:00:20.910
It was the scandal of the century in 17 France.

6
00:00:21.010 --> 00:00:25.310
The aristocratic world was rocked by allegations that spy of the former king was

7
00:00:25.311 --> 00:00:27.990
now threatening to sell state secrets to the British,

8
00:00:28.090 --> 00:00:32.990
but it wasn't the attempted extortion that really gripped high society so

9
00:00:33.150 --> 00:00:37.470
much as the identity of the blackmailer. The Chava Ador had been many things.

10
00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:41.380
Soldier diplomats champion fencer in the 1770s, though,

11
00:00:41.390 --> 00:00:43.900
there was just one part of their identity.

12
00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:48.620
The world was interested in was the chal really the chal air.

13
00:00:48.800 --> 00:00:51.460
In other words, were they male or female?

14
00:00:51.800 --> 00:00:55.500
The answer to that question would overturn popular notions of gender identity.

15
00:00:55.690 --> 00:00:59.780
Born biologically male Deon spent the first half of their life publicly living

16
00:01:00.040 --> 00:01:04.810
as a man, but then came the black male case. And everything changed,

17
00:01:05.290 --> 00:01:08.210
proved in court to be female Dion spent their last decades,

18
00:01:08.510 --> 00:01:11.970
not just living as a woman, but legally considered one under French law.

19
00:01:12.230 --> 00:01:15.330
So how did this happen and what significance might it all today?

20
00:01:15.670 --> 00:01:20.530
The ans lies in one of the regimes, most exciting thought provoking stories

21
00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:27.880
In the twilights of her life.

22
00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:32.200
The Shali a Deon would look back on the strange circumstances of her birth with

23
00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:36.280
a rice smile. Although born female, her father forced her to dress as a boy.

24
00:01:36.310 --> 00:01:39.280
In's play act the part of a young male in a noble French family,

25
00:01:39.520 --> 00:01:42.480
an episode recounted in her unpublished autobiography. Yeah.

26
00:01:42.870 --> 00:01:46.150
While the Shali may have felt this to be the truth about her childhood,

27
00:01:46.370 --> 00:01:49.750
that's not how her family saw it as far as they could tell their baby had

28
00:01:49.751 --> 00:01:52.550
arrived. Male born on October the fifth, 1728,

29
00:01:52.551 --> 00:01:57.030
the Shali Dior came from a family that was both aristocratic and desperately

30
00:01:57.031 --> 00:01:57.870
short on cash.

31
00:01:58.170 --> 00:02:02.190
<v 1>And yes, I know Shal a is a French title, not typically conferred on babies,</v>

32
00:02:02.370 --> 00:02:05.380
but since the birth name was Charles Genevieve,

33
00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:08.380
Louis Timothy eon Beaumont,

34
00:02:08.800 --> 00:02:13.700
I'm just going to use Shali a to make all of our lives just a little bit

35
00:02:13.701 --> 00:02:18.140
easier, especially mine, despite his family's relative poverty though,

36
00:02:18.141 --> 00:02:20.900
the time and plays may have been perfect for the young Shali a,

37
00:02:20.901 --> 00:02:22.420
this was the reign of Louisie the 15th,

38
00:02:22.421 --> 00:02:25.410
the time of glorious stability and confidence in France.

39
00:02:25.790 --> 00:02:29.610
<v 0>It was also an era when notions of gender among the upper classes,</v>

40
00:02:29.830 --> 00:02:32.130
at least were far more fluid than they'd ever been.

41
00:02:32.131 --> 00:02:36.050
This was an age when male courts were expected to dress a femininely and an

42
00:02:36.530 --> 00:02:37.890
anate sexually ambiguous manner.

43
00:02:38.150 --> 00:02:41.770
It was also an age from which the cult of show Nova was stronger than ever all

44
00:02:41.771 --> 00:02:42.291
over France.

45
00:02:42.291 --> 00:02:46.280
People were intimately familiar story of a young woman dressing as a man in

46
00:02:46.281 --> 00:02:47.840
order to wage war for the Chava,

47
00:02:48.010 --> 00:02:52.120
these nuances around gender would have a profound impact on his later life

48
00:02:52.520 --> 00:02:56.440
beacon of which it's time. We briefly address the issue of pronouns today.

49
00:02:56.441 --> 00:02:59.440
It's considered polite when covering trans people put to use their preferred

50
00:02:59.441 --> 00:03:02.600
pronoun the whole way through. So if someone was biologically female at birth,

51
00:03:02.601 --> 00:03:07.320
but identifies as male articles on him would normally use he from the get go.

52
00:03:07.380 --> 00:03:11.640
But because the story of the Chava takes place in such a different time.

53
00:03:11.670 --> 00:03:13.840
It's not really clear if this is suitable,

54
00:03:13.841 --> 00:03:17.480
especially since Deon may have considered themselves male at some points and

55
00:03:17.481 --> 00:03:18.440
female others,

56
00:03:19.010 --> 00:03:22.470
all of which is a really roundabout way of saying that we're going to follow

57
00:03:22.471 --> 00:03:26.470
historical presidents and use he for the pops when the Chava lived as a male and

58
00:03:26.810 --> 00:03:31.630
she for the late parts, looking forward to the comments on this episode, anyway,

59
00:03:31.660 --> 00:03:36.510
that out of the way Deon's early life was most notable for how brilliant he was

60
00:03:36.750 --> 00:03:40.540
at. Well, just about everything. During his studies at Paris's college to quo,

61
00:03:40.900 --> 00:03:44.180
NA the boy earns an arm of degrees by 19.

62
00:03:44.181 --> 00:03:48.340
He was a practicing lawyer by 24, he was publishing essays to Rae reviews.

63
00:03:48.341 --> 00:03:52.100
He was also a champion fencer who despite his slender androgynous appearance

64
00:03:52.101 --> 00:03:54.740
could best almost anyone in a deal. Yes,

65
00:03:54.940 --> 00:03:59.060
it wouldn't be swordsmanship legal expertise or writing ability that brought the

66
00:03:59.061 --> 00:04:00.690
young Yon to the King's attention.

67
00:04:01.110 --> 00:04:04.850
At least not according to his version of events in 1755,

68
00:04:04.851 --> 00:04:08.210
the Shali supposedly used his connections to get invited to a bull.

69
00:04:08.690 --> 00:04:10.330
The SI arriving dressed as a woman.

70
00:04:10.570 --> 00:04:14.450
He accompanied the King's mistres Madam PON Peor into a private room before

71
00:04:14.610 --> 00:04:15.610
seducing her that done.

72
00:04:15.611 --> 00:04:19.810
He returned to the party where Lou the 15th in turn promptly tried to seduce him

73
00:04:20.070 --> 00:04:24.920
good story as this is maybe bunkum the Chevalier was a

74
00:04:25.110 --> 00:04:27.200
notorious teller of tall tales,

75
00:04:27.420 --> 00:04:31.280
but whatever really happens not long after the party Deon found himself invited

76
00:04:31.380 --> 00:04:35.000
in on the King's little secret, be known as the secret Duar.

77
00:04:35.140 --> 00:04:38.640
The secret in question was a network of spies and back channel diplomats,

78
00:04:38.840 --> 00:04:40.280
the blue embedded across Europe.

79
00:04:40.610 --> 00:04:43.870
It was a clandestine operation that served the king and the king alone.

80
00:04:43.940 --> 00:04:46.430
That same year that Ian was recruited into its ranks.

81
00:04:46.530 --> 00:04:48.590
It was the beginning of a lifetime of adventure,

82
00:04:49.190 --> 00:04:51.910
intrigue and extreme mortal danger.

83
00:04:58.170 --> 00:05:02.820
In August of 1756, a Slen androgynous stepped out of a carriage in St.

84
00:05:02.821 --> 00:05:05.020
Petersburg, ready to start his new life.

85
00:05:05.200 --> 00:05:07.300
His shadow employers couldn't depict a better city.

86
00:05:07.360 --> 00:05:10.700
It was the reign of Elizabeth. The time of change and transformations,

87
00:05:10.701 --> 00:05:13.260
Russia embarked upon a second age of enlightenment.

88
00:05:13.360 --> 00:05:17.300
And nowhere was this feeling of change better captured than Elizabeth's weekly

89
00:05:17.490 --> 00:05:20.140
dancers known as met officer balls.

90
00:05:20.141 --> 00:05:22.410
These dancers were one of the highlights of St.

91
00:05:22.411 --> 00:05:24.530
Petersburg high society held every Tuesday.

92
00:05:24.680 --> 00:05:27.610
They saw all the women dress up as men and all the men dress up.

93
00:05:27.611 --> 00:05:30.970
As women though masks were allowed to be worn and everyone was under implicit

94
00:05:30.971 --> 00:05:32.690
instructions to arrive in the best,

95
00:05:32.760 --> 00:05:37.530
most convincing drag that money could buy as an Natas age, the French embassy,

96
00:05:37.560 --> 00:05:39.770
it's certain that the Chava attended these bulls.

97
00:05:39.771 --> 00:05:41.090
Given what we know is later life.

98
00:05:41.091 --> 00:05:44.520
It's fascinating to wonder how he felt on those Tuesday evenings,

99
00:05:44.521 --> 00:05:48.160
whether Elizabeth's dancers gave him a safe space to experiments.

100
00:05:48.300 --> 00:05:52.080
At the very least, they made an impact in his earlys. Some Petersburg years,

101
00:05:52.520 --> 00:05:55.600
Deion was ordered to return to France in Cognito. It was as a woman,

102
00:05:55.660 --> 00:06:00.640
he disguised himself to avoid detection yet fascinating as it was the

103
00:06:00.920 --> 00:06:05.160
gender fluid court occupied Don fraction of the Chavas time in Russia.

104
00:06:05.310 --> 00:06:10.000
Most of it was taken up by the more pressing issue of war just days after the

105
00:06:10.001 --> 00:06:12.400
androgynous young man stepped out of his carriage, Frederick,

106
00:06:12.500 --> 00:06:17.430
the greater invaded Saxony thereby kicking off the seven years war known in the

107
00:06:17.670 --> 00:06:20.030
us as the French and Indian war. It was one of the first,

108
00:06:20.080 --> 00:06:23.710
truly global conflicts fighting took place on five continents and involved

109
00:06:23.711 --> 00:06:25.230
nearly all of the great powers of the day.

110
00:06:25.380 --> 00:06:29.550
Naturally that included both France and Russia as partners against Russia and

111
00:06:29.551 --> 00:06:33.750
Britain Pariss and Petersburg had a mutual interest in keeping the other in the

112
00:06:33.751 --> 00:06:37.500
war that led to the Shal undertaking all sorts of secret missions for him using

113
00:06:37.560 --> 00:06:40.980
his clout with Elizabeth to stop her attacking France's Ottoman allies to

114
00:06:41.090 --> 00:06:43.740
clandestinely sabotaging a Russian bit for peace,

115
00:06:43.880 --> 00:06:48.020
but apparently just being a spy wasn't enough for Deion four years into the

116
00:06:48.180 --> 00:06:50.220
conflict. He decided to go fight on the front lines.

117
00:06:50.520 --> 00:06:54.300
Now this was easier said than done. The Chave had to beg the secrets head.

118
00:06:54.400 --> 00:06:57.300
The count of probably to be allowed to sign up as a soldier.

119
00:06:58.010 --> 00:07:01.090
Roby was so hesitant to place an asset in the firing line that it took until

120
00:07:01.370 --> 00:07:05.090
1761 for to eon to wear him down, wear him down. He did.

121
00:07:05.490 --> 00:07:08.810
And so it was that on may the 18th, the young man joined the drag goons.

122
00:07:08.960 --> 00:07:12.930
What followed was a half year of adventure in his short time as a soldier to eon

123
00:07:12.931 --> 00:07:16.410
took part in countless battles, earning a reputation for bravery.

124
00:07:16.550 --> 00:07:18.240
In one instance, he led a small horse,

125
00:07:18.400 --> 00:07:20.760
the captured hundreds of PRS in one go in another.

126
00:07:20.860 --> 00:07:22.560
He was wounded during a skirmish,

127
00:07:22.561 --> 00:07:24.760
something which only enhanced his standing yet.

128
00:07:24.761 --> 00:07:27.840
It wasn't the fighting itself that would change the course of Deon's life,

129
00:07:27.860 --> 00:07:30.760
but a small incident during the war one. So petty,

130
00:07:31.060 --> 00:07:35.920
it barely seemed worth noting in August roll dispatched the Chava to deliver

131
00:07:35.940 --> 00:07:37.800
an order to the count of gushy.

132
00:07:38.320 --> 00:07:42.870
And for fortunate GHI was part of a ke at the court that was allied with Madam

133
00:07:43.150 --> 00:07:47.790
Pompadur bro was from a opposing faction. So rather than being all like, sure,

134
00:07:47.791 --> 00:07:51.950
thanks for the message GHI gave to Ian dressing down and told him to stick his

135
00:07:51.951 --> 00:07:52.950
orders up, his Dar.

136
00:07:53.650 --> 00:07:57.350
And then he kicked him out from that moment on Ian would carry a special hatred

137
00:07:57.490 --> 00:08:00.380
in his heart for gushy, that sort of burning rage.

138
00:08:00.400 --> 00:08:02.940
We sometimes we offer people we'll no, we'll never meet again,

139
00:08:03.080 --> 00:08:06.340
but it may just feel like trash little did anyone know?

140
00:08:06.360 --> 00:08:11.180
But that meeting again was absolutely something the Chava and GHI were destined

141
00:08:11.181 --> 00:08:12.014
to do

142
00:08:17.720 --> 00:08:22.330
In the end Deon's military career only lasted seven months that January 17,

143
00:08:22.330 --> 00:08:23.570
62 Elizabeth of Russia died.

144
00:08:23.571 --> 00:08:27.610
And the secret initially recalled him to Petersburg. We say initially,

145
00:08:27.611 --> 00:08:31.490
because after the Chava had already racked up insane debts preparing for the

146
00:08:31.491 --> 00:08:34.410
move, his orders suddenly changed. The war was over.

147
00:08:34.790 --> 00:08:37.850
Now the secret wanted him not to go to Russia, but to London,

148
00:08:38.170 --> 00:08:42.720
a part of the team negotiating piece with or II Deon was required to act as a

149
00:08:42.721 --> 00:08:46.000
liaison between Kings while also gathering intelligence on the British.

150
00:08:46.180 --> 00:08:49.240
He did so well that he was given the French equivalent of a ignited,

151
00:08:49.380 --> 00:08:51.960
the title Shal. So good news,

152
00:08:52.280 --> 00:08:55.960
their patterns annoyed about me saying Shal the whole way through now his title

153
00:08:56.260 --> 00:09:00.160
is legit. So you can all calm down. Peace concluded.

154
00:09:00.161 --> 00:09:03.360
The secret asked to eon to stay on in Britain, ostensibly,

155
00:09:03.361 --> 00:09:05.560
this was to promote Paris's interests abroad,

156
00:09:05.660 --> 00:09:07.640
but really it was to prepare for a French invasion.

157
00:09:07.860 --> 00:09:11.560
One to eon was informed of in a series of letters. In the meantime, though,

158
00:09:11.561 --> 00:09:16.350
the Chava took to London like an Englishman takes to weather as planet

159
00:09:16.351 --> 00:09:19.470
century minister Aon was the diplomatic link between France and Britain.

160
00:09:19.740 --> 00:09:22.470
That meant becoming a fixture of king George's court,

161
00:09:22.471 --> 00:09:25.590
making connections with the rich and powerful and living a life of luxury,

162
00:09:25.810 --> 00:09:29.190
always dressed in his go's uniform. The Chava became a hit on London,

163
00:09:29.191 --> 00:09:30.024
social scene,

164
00:09:30.150 --> 00:09:33.870
challenging people to deals and boasting of his wartime exploits by the fall of

165
00:09:34.110 --> 00:09:37.580
1763 D or on was a minor celebrity among the English upper class as a role.

166
00:09:37.600 --> 00:09:38.660
He clearly relished.

167
00:09:38.800 --> 00:09:42.660
So you can imagine his horror and he received two very unpleasant bits of news.

168
00:09:43.260 --> 00:09:46.820
The first this, he was going to be replaced as plaintiff century minister.

169
00:09:46.920 --> 00:09:49.980
The seconds that his replacement was going to be that gigantic,

170
00:09:50.500 --> 00:09:54.500
ask the counter gushy Deon took one, look at his new orders and said,

171
00:09:55.800 --> 00:09:58.770
hell no, fuming over ghis treatment of him in the war.

172
00:09:59.090 --> 00:10:02.690
Deion refused to resign as minister where ghis bed turned up, trying to be like,

173
00:10:02.691 --> 00:10:05.730
come on date. This is an order, man, you gotta follow it.

174
00:10:06.250 --> 00:10:08.250
The Shal told them to stick their orders up.

175
00:10:08.570 --> 00:10:12.810
Their Collins challenged them to a du, but it was when gushy himself waited in.

176
00:10:12.910 --> 00:10:14.890
Things really blew up. Now in London,

177
00:10:14.950 --> 00:10:17.880
the counts invited Deonna over for a meal to trying straighten things out,

178
00:10:17.881 --> 00:10:20.640
Australia accepted and then returned from the meeting,

179
00:10:20.641 --> 00:10:24.600
telling everyone that GIA had tried to drug kidnap and assassinate him for the

180
00:10:24.601 --> 00:10:28.040
British press. This was the story they didn't even know they'd been waiting for.

181
00:10:28.640 --> 00:10:31.800
Deion was so theatrical and is broad sides against GCI.

182
00:10:31.801 --> 00:10:34.440
So cutting that the feud became a sensation.

183
00:10:34.460 --> 00:10:38.670
It helped that GIA was representing the French meaning the Chava tags could be

184
00:10:38.740 --> 00:10:42.750
sold as a kick in the hated Louis the 15th. Not,

185
00:10:43.130 --> 00:10:47.030
not that it was only London as you saw it that way in early 1764 fed up with the

186
00:10:47.031 --> 00:10:49.350
escalating row. Louis stripped de on of his pension.

187
00:10:49.700 --> 00:10:51.550
Andd an extradition warrant against him.

188
00:10:51.990 --> 00:10:54.110
Although the British CLE ignored the extradition request,

189
00:10:54.170 --> 00:10:57.620
the Southern cancellation of his funds left the Shal a tight spot.

190
00:10:57.880 --> 00:11:01.180
All of which explains his drastic. Next step.

191
00:11:01.700 --> 00:11:04.100
They marched Ian published all of his diplomatic correspondence,

192
00:11:04.101 --> 00:11:07.900
including personal letters from GHI the English public believed it was yet

193
00:11:07.901 --> 00:11:10.420
another attempt to humiliate the humorous French courts.

194
00:11:10.421 --> 00:11:13.980
But those in the secret knew it carried a much darker threat.

195
00:11:14.280 --> 00:11:17.810
The only letters Ian didn't publish were those relating to the top secret Anne

196
00:11:17.811 --> 00:11:18.644
for invading Britain.

197
00:11:18.990 --> 00:11:22.570
And now he was hinting to the public that he might have even more letters to

198
00:11:22.571 --> 00:11:24.570
reveal. There was a blatant attempt of blackmail,

199
00:11:24.810 --> 00:11:27.130
an agent of the crown holding his country's plans,

200
00:11:27.131 --> 00:11:29.090
hostage to defend his pension and title.

201
00:11:29.330 --> 00:11:32.450
The Chava was going to go toe to toe with king Lou self. Now,

202
00:11:32.451 --> 00:11:34.730
before we continue with today's video, let me thank our sponsor.

226
00:12:53.260 --> 00:12:57.370
The next months passed in a SW of intrigue. When his gambit to get gushy fired,

227
00:12:57.400 --> 00:13:00.170
fell through Deion uped, his demands telling the king,

228
00:13:00.171 --> 00:13:04.010
he now needed all debts that accrued in his aborted move to Russia paid off too.

229
00:13:04.070 --> 00:13:07.410
In return Paris allowed gushy to file a libel suit against the Chava.

230
00:13:07.560 --> 00:13:10.330
When a guilty verdict was returned, he was declared an outlaw,

231
00:13:10.331 --> 00:13:15.040
but the trouble with trying to reign in spices that well less

232
00:13:15.520 --> 00:13:17.280
spies rather than be captured, eon,

233
00:13:17.281 --> 00:13:21.160
disguised himself as a woman and fled to the village of by fleet there from the

234
00:13:21.161 --> 00:13:24.120
house of a British MP, he waged a secret war against his enemies.

235
00:13:24.180 --> 00:13:26.600
The first was to go to gushy in 1765,

236
00:13:26.601 --> 00:13:31.040
the Shali managed to find someone who'd swear in court that gushy had hired them

237
00:13:31.041 --> 00:13:31.580
to kill him.

238
00:13:31.580 --> 00:13:35.150
It wasn't true that the outrage of the British press was so great at GU she's

239
00:13:35.151 --> 00:13:37.550
house was attacked by Lynch mob with a new ambassador.

240
00:13:37.770 --> 00:13:40.430
Now effectively a prisoner in his own home, Deon resumed,

241
00:13:40.590 --> 00:13:41.630
his clandestine activities,

242
00:13:41.631 --> 00:13:44.030
passing more and more information on Britain's elite to broadly.

243
00:13:44.290 --> 00:13:48.590
It was a classic Caron stick approach with the Chava using broadly to show the

244
00:13:48.591 --> 00:13:48.810
king,

245
00:13:48.810 --> 00:13:53.350
all this juicy car information that he could provide while constantly waving the

246
00:13:53.351 --> 00:13:57.860
stick of blackmail outrageous as it was. It totally worked in 1766.

247
00:13:58.260 --> 00:14:00.340
Louis finally caved. He recalls gushy de France,

248
00:14:00.520 --> 00:14:02.100
let eon keep his position of planet,

249
00:14:02.101 --> 00:14:05.660
potentially minister and offered him a pension of 12,000 Lira.

250
00:14:05.661 --> 00:14:08.860
When the Shali said he wanted more, he was basically told, look, dude,

251
00:14:09.240 --> 00:14:11.540
you're won, but you're gonna win on my terms.

252
00:14:11.541 --> 00:14:16.330
Take this money and shut up before I send someone to assassinate you. For real,

253
00:14:16.630 --> 00:14:21.170
the Shali wisely took the money crucially though he didn't end over the

254
00:14:21.171 --> 00:14:24.570
incriminating invasion letters, keeping them back as insurance.

255
00:14:24.830 --> 00:14:28.770
It was a decision that would utterly transform the second half of his life.

256
00:14:28.910 --> 00:14:29.770
For the next four years,

257
00:14:29.771 --> 00:14:32.650
there was an uneasy truce between the Shali a and the king,

258
00:14:32.830 --> 00:14:37.320
but then in 1770 something strange happened in rumors began to swell that the

259
00:14:37.640 --> 00:14:41.080
Shal was not only appeared to be that his androgynous appearance wasn't because

260
00:14:41.360 --> 00:14:44.200
he was a feminine man, because he was actually female.

261
00:14:44.840 --> 00:14:48.640
Although Ian denied these rumors, they grew stronger by 1772.

262
00:14:48.641 --> 00:14:52.320
The London stock exchange was officially taking bets on the chimal gender.

263
00:14:52.540 --> 00:14:56.080
If you're feeling a little confused about this video's sudden change of gear.

264
00:14:56.110 --> 00:14:58.680
Well, you are not alone for a long time.

265
00:14:58.681 --> 00:15:02.320
Historians wondered if the gender rumors had been spread by the secret as a way

266
00:15:02.321 --> 00:15:04.520
of discrediting their rogue agents today, though,

267
00:15:04.630 --> 00:15:06.560
this is thought unlikely afterwards,

268
00:15:06.920 --> 00:15:10.400
Ian was biologically male petty wanted to dispel rumors that he was a, she,

269
00:15:10.710 --> 00:15:13.510
he had to do was drop his pants and say, da da.

270
00:15:13.970 --> 00:15:17.350
The fact that he didn't has led quite a few people to suspect a far stranger

271
00:15:17.370 --> 00:15:20.350
source for the rumors, the Chava himself it's here.

272
00:15:20.351 --> 00:15:22.830
That speculation gets really interesting.

273
00:15:22.880 --> 00:15:26.790
We've already seen Deon experiment with being in both boy mode and girl mode,

274
00:15:26.890 --> 00:15:31.420
but what if he now realized he wanted to stop experimenting and settle as her?

275
00:15:31.980 --> 00:15:35.780
And what if the most foolproof way to secure this transition was by convincing

276
00:15:35.781 --> 00:15:38.980
the public that she had been a girl posing as a boy all along. Remember,

277
00:15:38.981 --> 00:15:41.740
this is a time when everyone knows the Jonar legend,

278
00:15:41.940 --> 00:15:46.020
a legend that still occasionally inspired young girls to dress up as boys to

279
00:15:46.021 --> 00:15:49.780
fight just two decades before Hannah Snell had caused a sensation in Englands.

280
00:15:49.781 --> 00:15:52.850
When she revealed that she'd done exactly that in the colonial wars against

281
00:15:52.870 --> 00:15:54.010
France today,

282
00:15:54.011 --> 00:15:57.170
we have no way of knowing what was really going through the Shali A's mind,

283
00:15:57.171 --> 00:16:00.530
whether the gender rumors were part of an intricate plan or just a happy

284
00:16:00.810 --> 00:16:01.270
accident.

285
00:16:01.270 --> 00:16:05.250
But we do know where it ended up the Shali a would ride these rumors until the

286
00:16:05.270 --> 00:16:07.370
entire world came to accept her as female.

287
00:16:13.700 --> 00:16:17.000
It was October 17, 75. When the play ride Pierre Burma,

288
00:16:17.280 --> 00:16:21.280
she stepped off the boat in England and prepared to strike a deals call the last

289
00:16:21.281 --> 00:16:24.680
year or so. Dizzying would be a hell of an understatement on may the 10th,

290
00:16:25.560 --> 00:16:28.560
1774 Louis the 15th had gone to the great Versey in the sky,

291
00:16:29.120 --> 00:16:30.600
leaving Louis the 16th in charge.

292
00:16:30.780 --> 00:16:34.630
The new Louis had wasted no time dismantling the secret. As part of disclosure,

293
00:16:34.690 --> 00:16:38.550
the king had tried to finally repatriate the Chava to eon de France,

294
00:16:38.790 --> 00:16:40.110
to get ahold of the blackmail letters.

295
00:16:40.350 --> 00:16:43.710
It offered an additional payout and a guarantee of safe conduct only for the

296
00:16:43.950 --> 00:16:47.470
Chava to declare no and demand both 250,000 Libra.

297
00:16:47.610 --> 00:16:50.350
And to keep the title of plaintiff century minister Luther,

298
00:16:50.510 --> 00:16:52.790
the 16th had cut the insulin spy off,

299
00:16:53.330 --> 00:16:55.540
then had come the gunshots.

300
00:16:55.560 --> 00:16:59.700
The one held all the way around the world and his calculations had suddenly

301
00:16:59.701 --> 00:17:02.100
changed on April the 19th, 1775.

302
00:17:02.100 --> 00:17:05.740
The battle of Lexington and Concord had marked the opening of America's

303
00:17:05.741 --> 00:17:06.620
revolutionary war.

304
00:17:06.860 --> 00:17:09.980
Suddenly spies with access to Britain's elite were in high demand.

305
00:17:10.210 --> 00:17:14.850
Solu demanded that someone cut a deal with this damage value. And now I'm here.

306
00:17:15.210 --> 00:17:18.650
Bur mache was on his way to London, ready to strike that deal.

307
00:17:18.670 --> 00:17:22.090
It would be one of the strangest agreements in French legal history.

308
00:17:22.091 --> 00:17:23.410
Taking note of the rumors,

309
00:17:23.411 --> 00:17:27.210
flying around the British capital bur mache decided to make them integral to his

310
00:17:27.450 --> 00:17:28.530
approach. In return,

311
00:17:28.531 --> 00:17:31.890
you have to stop pretending to be male and live the rest of your life as the

312
00:17:31.891 --> 00:17:36.280
woman that you really are to the surprise eyes of everybody. The Shal air said,

313
00:17:36.680 --> 00:17:40.760
are we today is unknown exactly what the thinking was behind this unusual deal.

314
00:17:40.870 --> 00:17:44.960
It's possible by Marsha really believed the rumor is about the eons gender and

315
00:17:44.961 --> 00:17:47.880
decided this was the quickest way to end her charades.

316
00:17:47.900 --> 00:17:49.800
But that does seem unlikely.

317
00:17:50.080 --> 00:17:54.080
Bo Mae had gone to the stock exchange and laid money on the Chave being female.

318
00:17:54.560 --> 00:17:55.480
When Ian took his deal,

319
00:17:55.720 --> 00:17:58.680
Bo Mae had taken those running the pool to court to get his payout there.

320
00:17:58.681 --> 00:18:02.400
He had produced witnesses who swore that seen Ian's naked female body.

321
00:18:02.900 --> 00:18:04.800
Except that can't be true.

322
00:18:04.890 --> 00:18:09.670
Since we already know Deion was biologically male presum believe Bo Mae knew his

323
00:18:09.671 --> 00:18:10.550
witnesses were lying.

324
00:18:10.730 --> 00:18:15.710
So why did he cut this gender bending deal incredibly something to eon proposed

325
00:18:15.910 --> 00:18:16.870
to herself while in public,

326
00:18:16.970 --> 00:18:20.270
she threatened to fight a deal with Bo Mae over a male identity.

327
00:18:20.460 --> 00:18:23.750
There's no getting around the simple fact that she could have easily asserted

328
00:18:23.870 --> 00:18:27.590
her maleness if she wanted to. So we're left assuming that she didn't want to,

329
00:18:27.591 --> 00:18:29.580
but she wanted to live at as female.

330
00:18:29.760 --> 00:18:32.820
And that's exactly what happened in August, 1777,

331
00:18:32.821 --> 00:18:35.180
the Chava Ian returned to her native France.

332
00:18:35.400 --> 00:18:39.540
Now female in the eyes of the law society at large sorrow is a modern drone of

333
00:18:39.740 --> 00:18:42.580
ag dressing as a man to find the British and to claim that she was born

334
00:18:42.900 --> 00:18:43.680
biologically female,

335
00:18:43.680 --> 00:18:46.820
but raised male was repeated foreign white in a strange way.

336
00:18:46.821 --> 00:18:50.650
This perhaps allowed her to enjoy the best of both genders.

337
00:18:50.930 --> 00:18:53.690
Although the terms of the agreement stripped out of the title plan of

338
00:18:53.691 --> 00:18:55.290
potentially minister, for the simple reason,

339
00:18:55.291 --> 00:18:58.810
women couldn't hold the role and forbid her from wearing her beloved male,

340
00:18:59.010 --> 00:19:02.450
military uniform. She wasn't forced to conform to typically female behavior.

341
00:19:02.630 --> 00:19:06.450
She was allowed to drink and socialize alone with men or while also enjoying

342
00:19:06.610 --> 00:19:10.680
these services and Maria Antoinette's private dress maker and being ed female,

343
00:19:10.681 --> 00:19:14.840
perhaps it was just easier for the Chava to adopt this preexisting role,

344
00:19:14.841 --> 00:19:17.240
that of a warrior woman who behaved in a male way,

345
00:19:17.500 --> 00:19:21.000
or maybe society just kind of forced it upon her either way.

346
00:19:21.001 --> 00:19:23.240
She would live as a female for the rest of her life.

347
00:19:29.680 --> 00:19:33.110
Although the Chava now had legal recognition for her gender identity,

348
00:19:33.250 --> 00:19:36.870
her difficulties weren't over eight years after being repatriated to France.

349
00:19:37.010 --> 00:19:37.751
She left again,

350
00:19:37.751 --> 00:19:41.550
settling back in London that she continued to be accepted as female and even

351
00:19:41.870 --> 00:19:44.790
Fort some exhibition duals against men while wearing heavy dresses.

352
00:19:44.970 --> 00:19:48.950
But storm clouds were brewing over a home nation clouds that would soon

353
00:19:49.140 --> 00:19:52.740
unleashed the mother of all lightning bolts. The name of that bolt,

354
00:19:53.280 --> 00:19:55.580
the French revolution even based in Britain.

355
00:19:55.680 --> 00:19:59.180
The early days of the revolution were an exciting time with the Chava she

356
00:19:59.181 --> 00:20:00.620
cheered from across the channel.

357
00:20:00.680 --> 00:20:04.100
The storming of the Bastille when the new national assembly began its March

358
00:20:04.101 --> 00:20:04.781
towards war.

359
00:20:04.781 --> 00:20:07.940
She ran to Paris and offered to lead nor female fighting force to defend French

360
00:20:08.140 --> 00:20:08.973
on. She was turned down.

361
00:20:09.120 --> 00:20:13.250
But as anyone who's ever heard of the French revolution already knows things.

362
00:20:13.251 --> 00:20:16.890
Wouldn't stay exciting for much longer. In August, 1792,

363
00:20:16.930 --> 00:20:19.010
a gang of radicals led by maxil Roberts,

364
00:20:19.330 --> 00:20:23.810
Pierre and George deto staged insurrection taking control of France. From there.

365
00:20:23.910 --> 00:20:28.530
It was a short bloody March to the arrival of Madam guillotine and the studies

366
00:20:28.930 --> 00:20:30.970
sunk of severe heads, tumbling into baskets.

367
00:20:30.990 --> 00:20:35.000
The reign of terror Ian's family estates confiscated and her sister and mother

368
00:20:35.920 --> 00:20:36.140
guillotines.

369
00:20:36.140 --> 00:20:39.640
It also saw the annulment of the deal that she struck with Bo mache.

370
00:20:39.641 --> 00:20:43.560
The one granting her a pension and allowing her back into France for the rest of

371
00:20:43.561 --> 00:20:46.520
her life. The Chava would live like Aless EXR. Yeah,

372
00:20:46.540 --> 00:20:48.080
she would also keep on living as a female.

373
00:20:48.470 --> 00:20:53.400
This is why series that female identity was something forced on Deion by Mar or

374
00:20:53.401 --> 00:20:56.360
the king. Don't add up with the king dead Bo Mar and exile.

375
00:20:56.640 --> 00:21:00.560
And the agreement in tats, Deon was no longer bound by any of its stipulations.

376
00:21:00.620 --> 00:21:03.840
The fact that she spent the next 17 years identifying only as a woman

377
00:21:03.841 --> 00:21:07.070
strengthens the argument that this was who she really was.

378
00:21:07.370 --> 00:21:10.870
As France fell into chaos, the Chava struggled to stay afloat in London.

379
00:21:11.190 --> 00:21:14.190
A first she fought jewels for money and took part in fencing competitions,

380
00:21:14.250 --> 00:21:17.270
but a Arabia injury, but paid to that by the end of the decade,

381
00:21:17.450 --> 00:21:19.150
she was living with a widow Mary Cole,

382
00:21:19.170 --> 00:21:23.070
who may have been her lover and eating out in existence on the edge of society.

383
00:21:23.370 --> 00:21:26.030
She even wound up going to prison from paid debts.

384
00:21:26.031 --> 00:21:28.540
And although she tried to out an autobiography to raise funds,

385
00:21:28.541 --> 00:21:31.060
it went unpublished in a lifetime come a final years,

386
00:21:31.460 --> 00:21:34.060
Deion was pawing off everything she owned just to stay solvent.

387
00:21:34.160 --> 00:21:38.660
The Chava Ian died at home with Mary Cole on may the 21st 1810.

388
00:21:38.980 --> 00:21:40.460
When her body was examined, it was noted.

389
00:21:40.460 --> 00:21:43.580
She had male reproductive organs described in and now famous quote,

390
00:21:43.680 --> 00:21:48.330
as in every respect, perfectly formed her generations of historians.

391
00:21:48.360 --> 00:21:52.890
That was enough to declare her decades spent as a woman, a hoax today, though,

392
00:21:52.891 --> 00:21:56.130
we tend to see the Shal story differently. Here was someone who,

393
00:21:56.131 --> 00:21:57.130
despite being born,

394
00:21:57.490 --> 00:22:00.410
biologically male fought in one for the right to be recognized. As female,

395
00:22:00.720 --> 00:22:01.650
even in the modern world,

396
00:22:01.710 --> 00:22:05.770
France says only recently allowed such legal recognition in the era de Ian

397
00:22:05.771 --> 00:22:08.560
lived. This was just about unprecedented,

398
00:22:08.780 --> 00:22:12.560
but even aside from her pioneering gender status, the story of the Chava,

399
00:22:13.080 --> 00:22:16.520
Ian remains fascinating in the last decades of the Enion regime,

400
00:22:16.620 --> 00:22:20.040
she lived a life exciting enough to fill a dozen adventure novels, uh,

401
00:22:20.041 --> 00:22:24.600
life of espionage, betrayal, and secrecy, all set against a backdrop of war.

402
00:22:24.780 --> 00:22:27.400
She may not be the biggest name this channel has ever covered,

403
00:22:27.420 --> 00:22:32.310
but the story of these Sheva shows us that sometimes history's most fascinating

404
00:22:32.360 --> 00:22:35.270
tales are also its least well known.

405
00:22:36.480 --> 00:22:38.100
So I really hope you enjoy today's video.
