<v 0>This video is brought to you by rake on air buds with great sound so at a great</v>

00:00:04.651 --> 00:00:05.400
price,

3
00:00:05.400 --> 00:00:10.050
check the mouse by rake on.com forward slash biographics more on them in a bit.

4
00:00:16.360 --> 00:00:17.091
At first glance,

5
00:00:17.091 --> 00:00:21.050
it seemed like the most of the third was destined to become just a footnote in

6
00:00:21.051 --> 00:00:26.030
history. Another name on a long list of Kings who once ruled over Egypt,

7
00:00:26.300 --> 00:00:30.560
his father had been a media Curulla dying when the Mozo was only three years old

8
00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:33.200
afterwards, his stepmother took power for herself,

9
00:00:33.560 --> 00:00:37.850
and it would not have surprised anyone if the young Pharaoh's simply vanished

10
00:00:37.851 --> 00:00:40.910
without explanation, but that didn't happen. In fact,

11
00:00:40.911 --> 00:00:44.960
as a young man that Mosa learns and is trained in the ways of warfare

12
00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:49.580
anticipating that one day, he would assume the throne and that he did,

13
00:00:49.610 --> 00:00:52.700
and he immediately embarked on one military campaign.

14
00:00:52.701 --> 00:00:57.170
After another always looking to increase the size and power of his

15
00:00:57.171 --> 00:00:57.830
empire.

16
00:00:57.830 --> 00:01:01.790
He only stopped when it became clear that Egypt was the single most powerful

17
00:01:01.791 --> 00:01:05.540
nation in the region. And that his empire was the largest in the world.

18
00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:15.260
Third was born circa 1481 BC,

19
00:01:15.261 --> 00:01:19.760
and was part of the 18th dynasty of Egypt. The first one of the new kingdom,

20
00:01:19.820 --> 00:01:23.900
he was the son of Pharaoh that most of the seconds and a secondary wife named

21
00:01:24.350 --> 00:01:27.740
ISET. His name is alternately spelled Moses or mess.

22
00:01:27.741 --> 00:01:32.300
Although these all appear to be Greek variants of his actual Egyptian name,

23
00:01:32.480 --> 00:01:35.120
which was de drew who times, but of course,

24
00:01:35.121 --> 00:01:39.170
as we learned in the Bible and suntan command of Pharaoh did not have a single

25
00:01:39.171 --> 00:01:41.410
name. No, in fact, his Royal title,

26
00:01:41.570 --> 00:01:45.140
he contained five names and each one possessed variations,

27
00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:48.260
founds on different inscriptions and roughly translated.

28
00:01:48.261 --> 00:01:51.770
That means the strong bull arising in Thebes enduring of the kingship,

29
00:01:51.800 --> 00:01:53.090
like raw in heaven,

30
00:01:53.240 --> 00:01:58.040
sacred of appearances and powerful of mite lasting is the manifestation of raw

31
00:01:58.160 --> 00:02:02.360
thougth is born beautiful of form. And just say this video, isn't an hour long.

32
00:02:02.480 --> 00:02:04.100
We're going to stick with the Mosa.

33
00:02:04.220 --> 00:02:07.760
Normally the heir to the throne was the son of the Pharaoh with his great Royal

34
00:02:07.761 --> 00:02:10.310
wife who in this case was Hatshepsut. However,

35
00:02:10.311 --> 00:02:13.340
the two of them had only one daughter together, princess Neffer, uh,

36
00:02:13.370 --> 00:02:16.460
whose ultimate fate remains a mystery. Therefore by default,

37
00:02:16.461 --> 00:02:20.330
the throne went to th most of the third as he was his father's only son.

38
00:02:20.360 --> 00:02:22.970
Speaking of Hatshepsut, we already did a full video on her,

39
00:02:23.030 --> 00:02:26.150
where we talked about the complicated and uncertain relationship,

40
00:02:26.151 --> 00:02:27.440
which he had with us steps on.

41
00:02:27.441 --> 00:02:30.350
So we're not going to rehash all of that stuff right here.

42
00:02:30.351 --> 00:02:33.770
Just to give you the cliff notes version that most of the second died when his

43
00:02:33.771 --> 00:02:37.490
son was only three or four years old, he was too young to take over the throne.

44
00:02:37.520 --> 00:02:41.840
So instead had Shep sort of served as his regions. However, after a few years,

45
00:02:41.841 --> 00:02:46.250
she managed to assume full power becoming one of the few and arguably the most

46
00:02:46.251 --> 00:02:48.650
successful example of a female Pharaoh,

47
00:02:48.710 --> 00:02:53.000
the exact circumstances under which Hatshepsut took power from most of the third

48
00:02:53.001 --> 00:02:54.440
are still a bit of a mystery.

49
00:02:54.590 --> 00:02:57.050
When this event was first discovered about a hundred years ago,

50
00:02:57.051 --> 00:03:00.220
scholars of that time branded Hatshepsut manipulator,

51
00:03:00.430 --> 00:03:03.520
and to usurp up off to rule following the female Pharaoh's death,

52
00:03:03.521 --> 00:03:07.420
someone tried to erase it from history and the most likely suspect would have

53
00:03:07.421 --> 00:03:08.380
been a stepson.

54
00:03:08.590 --> 00:03:11.830
The main reason he would have done this would have been if he harbored deep

55
00:03:11.831 --> 00:03:14.770
resentment towards his stepmother, right? Well,

56
00:03:14.771 --> 00:03:18.010
many modern historians aren't completely sold on this idea anymore,

57
00:03:18.011 --> 00:03:21.850
mainly because there is no solid evidence to back any of it up. They're all,

58
00:03:22.030 --> 00:03:26.110
no ancient documents or inscriptions to suggest that that Mosa ever tried to

59
00:03:26.260 --> 00:03:30.700
rise up and take back power from Hatshepsut since the over yesterday outlived

60
00:03:30.820 --> 00:03:30.880
her,

61
00:03:30.880 --> 00:03:34.330
that Mosa would have had ample time to record his victory in the history books,

62
00:03:34.331 --> 00:03:38.350
mentioning how he won back his empire from his evil manipulating stepmother,

63
00:03:38.470 --> 00:03:42.310
the pharaohs recorded all of that trumps on all the last stat I and tomb

64
00:03:42.311 --> 00:03:45.520
inscriptions. The facts that no such proclamation exists,

65
00:03:45.521 --> 00:03:49.330
or at least has not been found yet suggests that maybe the relationship between

66
00:03:50.140 --> 00:03:54.190
[inaudible] and most of the third was more amicable than scholars initially

67
00:03:54.191 --> 00:03:55.210
believed after this.

68
00:03:55.211 --> 00:03:58.750
The fact that [inaudible] attempted to raise you from history likely occur

69
00:03:58.780 --> 00:04:01.940
decades after a death. So a more probable culprit,

70
00:04:02.140 --> 00:04:03.880
which have been most his own son.

71
00:04:04.600 --> 00:04:07.600
Amenhotep the second who may have done it to try and claim some of [inaudible]

72
00:04:07.601 --> 00:04:09.910
accomplishments as his own. Lastly,

73
00:04:09.911 --> 00:04:13.450
perhaps the most telling indicator that the most they felt no ill will towards

74
00:04:13.451 --> 00:04:17.170
Hatshepsut was the fact that he ultimately became a ferric rule.

75
00:04:17.171 --> 00:04:21.190
One of the service handbook is that you do not allow the person who you have

76
00:04:21.700 --> 00:04:24.460
usurped to live. You can look at other examples in history,

77
00:04:24.461 --> 00:04:28.900
and that person always met with an unfortunate accident or just disappeared from

78
00:04:28.901 --> 00:04:30.310
the historical record.

79
00:04:30.340 --> 00:04:34.210
What little evidence we have of that Moses early years suggests that he lived a

80
00:04:34.211 --> 00:04:37.120
relatively happy and safe life under Hatshepsut.

81
00:04:37.180 --> 00:04:40.540
He had been given an extensive education in anticipation of him. One day,

82
00:04:40.541 --> 00:04:41.410
ruling Egypt.

83
00:04:41.470 --> 00:04:45.550
He was not even kept under tight supervision as the young Al lived more with the

84
00:04:45.551 --> 00:04:49.720
soldiers than he did at touch-ups its course and learning all the intricacies of

85
00:04:49.721 --> 00:04:51.070
warfare plus skills,

86
00:04:51.130 --> 00:04:54.760
such as hand-to-hand combat horse riding and archery to show her a complete

87
00:04:54.761 --> 00:04:58.810
trust towards the end of our rain Hatshepsut even placed the Mosa in charge of

88
00:04:58.811 --> 00:04:59.830
her armies though.

89
00:04:59.890 --> 00:05:03.430
She had little interest in Congress and mainly use them secure the borders and

90
00:05:03.431 --> 00:05:04.840
protects trade expeditions.

91
00:05:05.050 --> 00:05:08.740
She seemingly did everything she could to ensure that when she finally died,

92
00:05:08.890 --> 00:05:12.610
her empire would be left in good, strong and capable hands.

93
00:05:19.350 --> 00:05:19.500
<v 2>[Inaudible].</v>

94
00:05:19.500 --> 00:05:24.150
<v 0>Hatshepsut died in 1458 BC going by the conventional</v>

95
00:05:24.151 --> 00:05:28.320
Egyptian chronology and that most of the third finally came to rule over his

96
00:05:28.321 --> 00:05:31.410
empire. 22 years after he actually became a Pharaoh,

97
00:05:31.620 --> 00:05:34.950
he took a decisively different approach to governing than his stepmother

98
00:05:34.970 --> 00:05:39.060
mobilizing Egypt's army. Isn't becoming a mighty Congress. Of course,

99
00:05:39.061 --> 00:05:41.640
he had the benefit of decades of peace and prosperity,

100
00:05:41.641 --> 00:05:45.210
which allowed the Ambar to flourish and get rich up the most that would go on to

101
00:05:45.211 --> 00:05:47.640
become agent de Gibbs'. The most formidable military leader,

102
00:05:47.670 --> 00:05:51.000
expanding the empire to its greatest ever territorial extent.

103
00:05:51.030 --> 00:05:55.500
Ancient RAC orders show 17 major military campaigns into foreign lands starting

104
00:05:55.501 --> 00:05:58.070
with Moses first year as sole ruler.

105
00:05:58.310 --> 00:06:02.180
And this does not take into account minor skirmishes or battles to defend the

106
00:06:02.181 --> 00:06:05.210
borders. Well, we're not going to discuss all of the campaigns.

107
00:06:05.211 --> 00:06:10.100
We will examine the most important ones and we will start off with the first it

108
00:06:10.101 --> 00:06:13.190
was against the city of Maketto situated in a modern day, Israel,

109
00:06:13.370 --> 00:06:16.070
it would lead to become a place of biblical significance because it was

110
00:06:16.071 --> 00:06:18.140
mentioned in the book of revelation 16,

111
00:06:18.141 --> 00:06:22.610
16 as the location of a great battle that would Mark the end times. However,

112
00:06:22.611 --> 00:06:26.780
the city became much better known by its Greek name Armageddon and the 15th

113
00:06:26.781 --> 00:06:27.950
century BC though,

114
00:06:28.070 --> 00:06:31.430
the ghetto was part of a group of canonized cities that were under the hedger.

115
00:06:31.431 --> 00:06:33.670
Many of the Pharaoh, they went all parts of Egypt,

116
00:06:33.700 --> 00:06:35.280
but while hot shops had rains,

117
00:06:35.380 --> 00:06:38.500
they paid tribute and sent over soldiers for our armies. However,

118
00:06:38.501 --> 00:06:42.400
as is often the case when there is a period of transition of power mosquito

119
00:06:42.410 --> 00:06:46.270
considered the death of Hatshepsut since the Ascension of Mosa,

120
00:06:46.330 --> 00:06:47.830
as the perfect time to rebel,

121
00:06:47.950 --> 00:06:51.220
hoping that the new Pharaoh would be less formidable than his predecessor.

122
00:06:51.250 --> 00:06:53.260
That turns out to not be the case.

123
00:06:53.320 --> 00:06:57.040
It is likely that either Mosa or Hatshepsut saw this move coming,

124
00:06:57.100 --> 00:06:59.710
the Pharaoh was quick to mobilize his army to March on Maketto.

125
00:06:59.711 --> 00:07:01.930
And according to his personal military scribe,

126
00:07:02.080 --> 00:07:06.730
he covered 150 miles in 10 days out another day's rest. And in 11 days,

127
00:07:06.731 --> 00:07:09.670
the Egyptian army arrived in Manhattan today called yadda.

128
00:07:10.090 --> 00:07:11.740
Now the fortress city of mosquito,

129
00:07:11.890 --> 00:07:15.190
the Egyptians were not only facing the people of Maketto as the city entered an

130
00:07:15.191 --> 00:07:19.240
Alliance with another ancient Levantine kingdom called Kadesh.

131
00:07:19.300 --> 00:07:23.080
The King of Kadesh also convinced other counter Knights sentiments to help in

132
00:07:23.230 --> 00:07:25.600
that coalition, as well as the kingdom of Matana.

133
00:07:25.690 --> 00:07:28.810
There were quite a few States in the area who were eager to see Egypt,

134
00:07:28.830 --> 00:07:32.770
power and influence dwindle. They thought that this was the perfect opportunity.

135
00:07:32.890 --> 00:07:36.160
Now that the nation was governed by someone young and inexperienced,

136
00:07:36.220 --> 00:07:39.730
they planned to do everything in their power to keep the most as rain short,

137
00:07:39.760 --> 00:07:42.850
but in the ends, they wouldn't get their wish. And yeah,

138
00:07:43.010 --> 00:07:45.970
the Pharaoh conferred with his most senior advisors,

139
00:07:45.971 --> 00:07:48.120
because he had to make an important decision.

140
00:07:48.130 --> 00:07:51.850
He had to select the way by which she would approach McGee. Right?

141
00:07:51.940 --> 00:07:55.840
You had a choice between three roads. Two of them were broadened in the open.

142
00:07:55.841 --> 00:07:58.030
So traveling on them would be safe and fast.

143
00:07:58.210 --> 00:08:01.750
The third was a narrow pass where it soldiers would have to walk single file and

144
00:08:01.930 --> 00:08:05.200
would lead to his Vanguard, engaging the enemy in combat.

145
00:08:05.201 --> 00:08:08.050
While the soldiers at the red still were traversing. The POS,

146
00:08:08.110 --> 00:08:10.690
as you might expect, all his advisors recommended that the most,

147
00:08:10.691 --> 00:08:12.400
they choose one of these safer roads,

148
00:08:12.430 --> 00:08:15.550
but the young Pharaoh said this to his generals.

149
00:08:15.610 --> 00:08:19.300
I swear as rah loves me as my father, Amman favors me.

150
00:08:19.450 --> 00:08:22.780
As my nostrils are rejuvenated with life and satisfaction.

151
00:08:22.930 --> 00:08:27.730
My majesty shall proceed upon this Aruna road. Let him of you wishes,

152
00:08:27.760 --> 00:08:32.620
go upon these roads of which you speak and let him have you who wishes come in

153
00:08:32.621 --> 00:08:34.570
the following of my majesty behold,

154
00:08:34.690 --> 00:08:39.550
they will say these enemies whom rah abominate as his majesty set

155
00:08:39.551 --> 00:08:42.220
out on another road because he has become afraid of us.

156
00:08:42.550 --> 00:08:45.160
So they will speak unsurprisingly. After his speech,

157
00:08:45.161 --> 00:08:47.170
all his commanders agreed to follow their Pharaoh.

158
00:08:47.350 --> 00:08:50.470
The most then went outside and talked to his man about traversing,

159
00:08:50.471 --> 00:08:54.160
the dangerous pass, promising them that he would be at the front of the column.

160
00:08:54.250 --> 00:08:57.210
So the entire army traveled the perilous road,

161
00:08:57.240 --> 00:09:00.210
but this proved to be actually a stroke of genius.

162
00:09:00.270 --> 00:09:02.640
When they finally emerged on the other side of the past,

163
00:09:02.641 --> 00:09:04.920
they found no enemies waiting for them. In fact,

164
00:09:04.921 --> 00:09:07.830
the coalition never considered that the most they would take this road.

165
00:09:07.831 --> 00:09:11.340
So now the interruptions had the element of surprise on their side.

166
00:09:11.400 --> 00:09:15.330
The battle of Maketto most likely occurred on April the 16th, 1457.

167
00:09:15.390 --> 00:09:18.540
The size of the armies can only be vaguely estimated,

168
00:09:18.541 --> 00:09:21.780
but the historians believe each site had at least 10,000 men,

169
00:09:21.900 --> 00:09:23.970
probably closer to 15 thousands.

170
00:09:24.030 --> 00:09:27.060
We have the work subscribed that tells us how it went down. His majesty.

171
00:09:27.120 --> 00:09:30.870
He went forth in a chariot of Electrum arrayed in his weapons of war,

172
00:09:30.930 --> 00:09:34.680
like Horus, the smarter Lord of power, like Monteux of Thebes.

173
00:09:34.770 --> 00:09:37.440
While his father among strengthens his arms.

174
00:09:37.560 --> 00:09:41.100
The Southern wing of this army of his majesty was on a Hill South of the Burke

175
00:09:41.101 --> 00:09:41.760
of kina.

176
00:09:41.760 --> 00:09:45.720
The Northern wing was at the Northwest of mosquito while his majesty was in the

177
00:09:45.730 --> 00:09:50.310
center with Amman as the protection of his members, the Valor of his lens,

178
00:09:50.520 --> 00:09:53.370
then his majesty prevailed against them as the head of his army.

179
00:09:53.371 --> 00:09:56.010
And when they saw his majesty prevailing against them,

180
00:09:56.220 --> 00:10:00.720
they fled headlong to Makita and fear abandoning their horses and their chariots

181
00:10:00.721 --> 00:10:04.230
of golden Silva. The people hold them up, pulling them by their clothing,

182
00:10:04.320 --> 00:10:05.100
into the city.

183
00:10:05.100 --> 00:10:08.910
The people of this city had enclosed it against them and lowered clothing to

184
00:10:09.120 --> 00:10:12.360
pull them up into the city. The fare of his majesty had ended their hops.

185
00:10:12.361 --> 00:10:16.680
Their arms were powerless. His sup and da-dum was victorious among them.

186
00:10:16.800 --> 00:10:19.080
Now this account was clearly spruced up to make the most.

187
00:10:19.081 --> 00:10:23.010
I see him as heroic as possible and refer to him as his majesty.

188
00:10:23.070 --> 00:10:26.880
A lot that's described does mention a mistake on behalf of the fat rope.

189
00:10:26.910 --> 00:10:30.330
Once the enemy had begun retreating, he did not press the attack immediately.

190
00:10:30.450 --> 00:10:32.580
Instead allowing his men to plunge the battlefields.

191
00:10:32.640 --> 00:10:34.580
If he would have engaged the fleeing combatant,

192
00:10:34.800 --> 00:10:37.500
he could have ended the war right to then in that instead,

193
00:10:37.501 --> 00:10:39.190
the soldiers retreated inside McGee,

194
00:10:39.300 --> 00:10:42.780
which was a fortress and the most absolutely siege on the city.

195
00:10:43.290 --> 00:10:46.230
The King of Kadesh had managed to make his escape. Meanwhile,

196
00:10:46.231 --> 00:10:47.640
the Egyptians that no other choice,

197
00:10:47.641 --> 00:10:50.940
but to wait until the people of mosquito ran out of supplies and surrenders,

198
00:10:51.180 --> 00:10:54.330
it took seven or eight months before they finally exhausted all their food and

199
00:10:54.331 --> 00:10:57.090
water and tapped to throw themselves at the mercy of the Pharaoh.

200
00:10:57.330 --> 00:11:00.900
And indeed the most, it was actually pretty merciful by their standards.

201
00:11:00.930 --> 00:11:02.160
Of course, he plundered Benito,

202
00:11:02.370 --> 00:11:06.180
it's valuables taking tens of thousands of capital over 2000 horses and almost a

203
00:11:06.181 --> 00:11:08.910
thousand chariots, countless weapons, laborers, and suits of armor.

204
00:11:09.180 --> 00:11:10.590
But he did not burn the city.

205
00:11:10.680 --> 00:11:14.400
He did not kill its population and he did not even execute the high officials

206
00:11:14.401 --> 00:11:18.060
responsible for the insurrection. He did replace them with people loyal to him,

207
00:11:18.270 --> 00:11:22.350
and he also took their children to be raised back in Egypt. In reality, though,

208
00:11:22.351 --> 00:11:25.890
these children were prisoners in case their father has got any ideas of

209
00:11:25.891 --> 00:11:27.480
rebelling. Again, I want to thank you.

210
00:11:27.481 --> 00:11:31.880
Set in the wood rebel against is today's sponsor.

211
00:11:32.120 --> 00:11:37.100
The fantastic Ray con who make these ear buds rake on make great earbuds

212
00:11:37.160 --> 00:11:39.080
with great sounds at an affordable price.

213
00:11:39.320 --> 00:11:43.040
By now they're all about innovative air by design at prices that don't break the

214
00:11:43.041 --> 00:11:47.690
bank. They sent me a pair of these. These are the everyday easy 25 earbuds.

215
00:11:47.691 --> 00:11:50.780
Now I've been using them for a couple of weeks, but just take one outset.

216
00:11:51.020 --> 00:11:55.390
They fit very easily in the air and have quite weird shaped his for some reason.

217
00:11:55.600 --> 00:11:58.780
So it's quite nice. Often other headphones, I'll be walking down the street,

218
00:11:59.200 --> 00:12:02.410
they'll drop onto the floor yet to have that problem with these one.

219
00:12:02.411 --> 00:12:05.650
Also you get six hours of battery life and the air buds or playtime,

220
00:12:05.651 --> 00:12:07.750
I should say, in the elbows themselves.

221
00:12:07.840 --> 00:12:11.080
Then you put them in this case and you get four more charges.

222
00:12:11.081 --> 00:12:16.000
So I have not charged these up very regularly because it's

223
00:12:16.001 --> 00:12:20.470
just so much charged held in this magically twenty-five case.

224
00:12:20.560 --> 00:12:22.810
Now I've used expensive devices. I've used cheap earbuds.

225
00:12:22.811 --> 00:12:27.790
What Ray can really do is they deliver a premium experience at about half the

226
00:12:27.791 --> 00:12:30.070
price of other premium wadis earbuds.

227
00:12:30.280 --> 00:12:34.090
So if you go to buy Ray con.com forward slash biographics,

228
00:12:34.091 --> 00:12:37.360
you'll get 15% off your order and let's go back to today's.

229
00:12:43.920 --> 00:12:44.220
<v 1>[Inaudible].</v>

230
00:12:44.220 --> 00:12:48.050
<v 0>It was far more than a victory against one city beside the fact that the most</v>

231
00:12:48.240 --> 00:12:50.940
eight now held a location with important strategic value.

232
00:12:51.270 --> 00:12:55.080
His triumphant mosquito instantly made him known as a force to be reckoned with

233
00:12:55.200 --> 00:12:55.950
in the region,

234
00:12:55.950 --> 00:12:59.760
even so that mostly knew that his hold on cannon was tenuous of best.

235
00:12:59.910 --> 00:13:03.600
The numerous other cities in the area might not have openly raised arms against

236
00:13:03.601 --> 00:13:06.210
him, but there was certainly no friends of Egypt.

237
00:13:06.270 --> 00:13:07.860
If he were to simply return home,

238
00:13:07.861 --> 00:13:10.800
it would not be long before they would renounce his authority,

239
00:13:10.950 --> 00:13:13.020
even openly rebel against them,

240
00:13:13.021 --> 00:13:17.940
especially if aided by other powerful factions like Matana or Kadash holding

241
00:13:17.941 --> 00:13:21.960
the Gita mostly did have an advantage besides its strategic value.

242
00:13:21.961 --> 00:13:24.600
The city was also a vital agricultural center,

243
00:13:24.601 --> 00:13:27.000
which provided a lot of food for nearby cities.

244
00:13:27.270 --> 00:13:29.640
If the Pharaoh were inclined to wait until a Windsor,

245
00:13:29.641 --> 00:13:33.810
he could simply have starved them into submission. He saw no need to delay.

246
00:13:33.870 --> 00:13:36.540
He still had a strong army and fresh supplies.

247
00:13:36.720 --> 00:13:38.640
So he continued his military campaign.

248
00:13:38.850 --> 00:13:41.910
It has been estimated that throughout most his entire career,

249
00:13:42.090 --> 00:13:45.660
he con good well over 300 cities, towns and other various settlements.

250
00:13:45.810 --> 00:13:49.650
The others did not really benefit from a detailed accounts like that at the

251
00:13:49.651 --> 00:13:50.910
battle of mosquito though,

252
00:13:51.150 --> 00:13:54.510
as most of them simply had itemized lists containing the spoils of war.

253
00:13:54.570 --> 00:13:58.440
Presumably this is partly because most of those people chose not to fight at all

254
00:13:58.650 --> 00:14:01.470
and simply submitted to the Pharaoh anyway, from the Gita,

255
00:14:01.650 --> 00:14:04.560
mostly traveled North following the course of the Leteny river,

256
00:14:04.680 --> 00:14:08.700
there were still some cities like tar and sit on who were on friendly terms with

257
00:14:08.701 --> 00:14:09.421
the Egyptians,

258
00:14:09.421 --> 00:14:13.230
and they were glad to have them in the area helping to minimize the influence of

259
00:14:13.231 --> 00:14:17.340
other nations. Kadesh in particular, according to ancient records that most,

260
00:14:17.460 --> 00:14:19.650
they also built a fortress somewhere in this region.

261
00:14:19.710 --> 00:14:24.390
It was cool to make a Hapa is the binder of the barbarians with the arrival of

262
00:14:24.391 --> 00:14:27.660
autumn, that Moseley decided that it was probably time to return to Egypt.

263
00:14:27.720 --> 00:14:30.270
Each new settlements. He conquers meant another Garrison,

264
00:14:30.271 --> 00:14:33.180
which she wants to leave behind troops into ensure peace.

265
00:14:33.181 --> 00:14:35.730
And this meant his army was starting to dwindle. On the other hand,

266
00:14:35.770 --> 00:14:38.520
he was returning to thieves with over 7,000 captives.

267
00:14:38.670 --> 00:14:40.170
These were not strictly slaves,

268
00:14:40.171 --> 00:14:44.190
but rather unpaid workers who were expected to pay part of their tribute in the

269
00:14:44.191 --> 00:14:45.300
form of free labor.

270
00:14:45.360 --> 00:14:48.420
The following Springs that mostly departed Egypt again with his army,

271
00:14:48.450 --> 00:14:52.040
but the next military campaigns mainly involved collecting tributes and only

272
00:14:52.041 --> 00:14:55.910
occasionally putting down a new rebellion as a show of force was generally

273
00:14:55.911 --> 00:14:58.640
enough to keep most of the other cities in check. Of course,

274
00:14:58.670 --> 00:14:59.780
this didn't always work,

275
00:14:59.810 --> 00:15:03.200
but mostly it was faced with a crisis when the city state of tuna revolted

276
00:15:03.201 --> 00:15:05.240
alongside Kadesh and that vassals,

277
00:15:05.241 --> 00:15:09.320
and also aided by the Matana who remained Egypt's most powerful folk.

278
00:15:09.500 --> 00:15:10.910
The Ferrero had to react quickly.

279
00:15:10.911 --> 00:15:13.880
And this time he was far more ruthless in his actions.

280
00:15:13.910 --> 00:15:17.540
Ancient records stay that the settlements, which rebels were destroyed,

281
00:15:17.600 --> 00:15:21.890
the city States of tuneup and Kadesh however were a bit more challenging in the

282
00:15:22.160 --> 00:15:25.700
ends that mostly chose to attack tuneup Kadesh was a veritable fortress,

283
00:15:25.701 --> 00:15:29.600
and the only way to defeat it was with a long siege and the Pharaoh didn't not

284
00:15:29.620 --> 00:15:32.570
have time for one. When the entire region was close to insurrection,

285
00:15:33.050 --> 00:15:36.680
tuneup was the easiest targets and it ended up being even easier than most I

286
00:15:36.681 --> 00:15:40.040
expected because neither Kadesh tunnel Madani came to it Sade.

287
00:15:40.041 --> 00:15:41.360
So the city had no choice,

288
00:15:41.361 --> 00:15:44.360
but to surrender and accept what type of punishment the Pharaoh had in store.

289
00:15:50.740 --> 00:15:51.280
<v 2>[Inaudible].</v>

290
00:15:51.280 --> 00:15:55.270
<v 0>Pretty clear to most say that he had to deal with the kingdom of Matana one way</v>

291
00:15:55.271 --> 00:15:56.800
or another for this. However,

292
00:15:56.860 --> 00:16:00.460
the farrowing needed to find a way of traveling around 500 miles all the way

293
00:16:00.461 --> 00:16:02.230
from Egypt across the Euphrates river,

294
00:16:02.231 --> 00:16:05.650
with an army while keeping it fed healthy and safe enough so that it would be

295
00:16:05.651 --> 00:16:09.430
able to find a powerful foe at the end of the journey. This was a tough task,

296
00:16:09.460 --> 00:16:12.610
3,500 years ago, considering that a large army,

297
00:16:12.611 --> 00:16:14.770
you could only average around 10 miles per day,

298
00:16:14.830 --> 00:16:17.620
and that's not taking into account minor skirmishes that it would likely to

299
00:16:17.621 --> 00:16:19.630
encounter along the way to achieve this goal.

300
00:16:19.631 --> 00:16:22.930
So mostly needed a place that he could reliably use as a forward base of

301
00:16:22.931 --> 00:16:25.390
operations and to foster method of transportation.

302
00:16:25.420 --> 00:16:28.390
This was not something that the Pharaoh achieved in one go. In fact,

303
00:16:28.420 --> 00:16:30.790
he fought the Bhutani for about half of his soul reign,

304
00:16:30.791 --> 00:16:34.960
engaging them in one way or another. During at least nine military campaigns,

305
00:16:35.110 --> 00:16:37.960
he continued to build fortresses further up North into his empire,

306
00:16:37.990 --> 00:16:41.260
starting with the sixth campaign. He began approaching Kanaan by sea,

307
00:16:41.261 --> 00:16:45.610
which was foster and allowed him to submit to the problematic city of Kadesh as

308
00:16:45.611 --> 00:16:47.590
he slowly but steadily built up his fleet.

309
00:16:47.740 --> 00:16:50.890
The mostly also brought the Phoenician port cities under his control to gain

310
00:16:50.891 --> 00:16:52.120
access to that harvest.

311
00:16:52.360 --> 00:16:56.080
Eventually the Pharaoh's strength in that area grew large enough that he was

312
00:16:56.081 --> 00:16:59.650
able to cross the afraid to use river and as launched a surprise invasion on his

313
00:16:59.651 --> 00:17:04.570
phone, capturing the major Italian city of Aleppo located today in Syria,

314
00:17:04.630 --> 00:17:07.870
it was a huge blow for the Matana whose influence in the region decreased

315
00:17:07.900 --> 00:17:10.270
significantly. They weren't wiped out completely,

316
00:17:10.271 --> 00:17:13.990
but it became clear who was the major power in the region as an added bonus,

317
00:17:13.991 --> 00:17:17.950
the nearby Kings of the Hittites Babylonians and the Syrians all gave gifts to

318
00:17:17.951 --> 00:17:20.740
the most as tribute to show their submission.

319
00:17:20.830 --> 00:17:24.010
It was arguably the most that's most notable military campaigns.

320
00:17:24.190 --> 00:17:27.340
When he returned to Egypt, he commemorated his tribe by erecting,

321
00:17:27.341 --> 00:17:29.800
a large obelisk, which can still be found today,

322
00:17:29.950 --> 00:17:33.460
except that it's an Istanbul having been moved by Roman emperor.

323
00:17:33.461 --> 00:17:35.710
Theodosius now speaking of the ABOs square,

324
00:17:35.711 --> 00:17:38.320
mainly focused on that most of his military career today,

325
00:17:38.321 --> 00:17:40.780
since that's what he's primarily remembered for,

326
00:17:40.781 --> 00:17:44.410
but we should mention that he was also a prolific builder who commissioned over

327
00:17:44.411 --> 00:17:48.130
50 monuments, temples and tombs during his reign, if nothing else,

328
00:17:48.131 --> 00:17:50.490
that mostly needed all those extra walls and columns.

329
00:17:50.491 --> 00:17:54.180
So video space to record all of his military victories,

330
00:17:54.270 --> 00:17:57.420
the place that benefited most from his attention was the vast temple complex

331
00:17:57.421 --> 00:18:00.510
located today near the modern city of Locksaw best known,

332
00:18:00.540 --> 00:18:03.240
simply as contact the most. They did not found it,

333
00:18:03.270 --> 00:18:06.420
but he added more constructions to it than any other Pharaoh,

334
00:18:06.450 --> 00:18:10.560
mainly to the temple of a moon. Even today Karnak is famed for its John pillars.

335
00:18:10.561 --> 00:18:13.560
And is one of the main reasons why Luxor is dubs?

336
00:18:13.561 --> 00:18:15.330
The world's greatest open-air museum.

337
00:18:21.650 --> 00:18:22.130
<v 1>[Inaudible].</v>

338
00:18:22.130 --> 00:18:25.430
<v 0>The Pharaoh's we'd like to complete that mostly story by looking at what</v>

339
00:18:25.760 --> 00:18:27.800
happened to him after he was turned into a mummy,

340
00:18:27.860 --> 00:18:30.380
the most of the third died in 1425,

341
00:18:30.381 --> 00:18:35.090
BC aged 56 under unknown circumstances, his son Aman hotel,

342
00:18:35.110 --> 00:18:38.920
the seconds became the new Pharaoh wealth at most say it was buried in tomb,

343
00:18:39.380 --> 00:18:44.090
KV 34 in the Valley of the Kings as burial location is part of the raw cash,

344
00:18:44.091 --> 00:18:48.590
which is today a complex of tombs that contained many Pharaoh's Royal wives,

345
00:18:48.591 --> 00:18:50.060
princes, princesses,

346
00:18:50.061 --> 00:18:54.470
and tiny priests from the 17th to the 21st dynasties unsurprisingly.

347
00:18:54.620 --> 00:18:58.160
Most they wanted to be buried there because it was the final resting place of

348
00:18:58.161 --> 00:19:00.770
his father, grandfather and ancestors.

349
00:19:00.830 --> 00:19:04.040
The downside was that this was a very well known area and the tombs were

350
00:19:04.160 --> 00:19:07.550
subjected to very heavy looting and desecration meant that most of those mommy

351
00:19:07.551 --> 00:19:10.730
was first unwrapped in modern times during the late 19th century,

352
00:19:10.760 --> 00:19:12.630
French Egyptologist guest and Ms.

353
00:19:13.100 --> 00:19:17.030
Sparrow noted that his mummy had been torn out of the coffin by robbers who

354
00:19:17.031 --> 00:19:20.150
stripped it and rifled its, if the jewels with which it was covered,

355
00:19:20.180 --> 00:19:22.580
injuring it in that haste did carry away the spoil.

356
00:19:22.640 --> 00:19:26.300
It was subsequently reentered and has remained undisturbed until the present day

357
00:19:26.390 --> 00:19:28.460
as mother had suffered extensive damage. In fact,

358
00:19:28.461 --> 00:19:32.240
it was among the worst conditions. Any mommy recovered from the raw cash.

359
00:19:32.270 --> 00:19:35.510
This wasn't helped by the fact that it was removed unwrapped and examined using

360
00:19:35.511 --> 00:19:39.530
19th century technology, which probably made things worse only has had,

361
00:19:39.531 --> 00:19:42.290
was intact and remains intact at the Kira museum.

362
00:19:42.291 --> 00:19:46.760
But scholars still noticed that it did not show the image of manly beauty with

363
00:19:46.761 --> 00:19:49.010
intelligent features depicted in his statutes,

364
00:19:49.011 --> 00:19:52.010
but rather someone whose forehead was abnormally low,

365
00:19:52.070 --> 00:19:54.380
the eyes deeply sunk the jaw heavy,

366
00:19:54.500 --> 00:19:58.220
the lips thick and to the cheekbones extremely prominent. But of course,

367
00:19:58.250 --> 00:20:02.270
none of this mattered at the end of the day that mostly made Egypt a dominant

368
00:20:02.271 --> 00:20:05.900
power wants more and forged the largest empire in the world's record.
