6
00:00:21.410 --> 00:00:22.340
Early 17 hundreds,

7
00:00:22.341 --> 00:00:25.250
the English army was not very highly thought of traditionally.

8
00:00:25.251 --> 00:00:29.660
They relied on their powerful Navy to protect their islands from invasion.

9
00:00:29.661 --> 00:00:34.040
And so their army wasn't nearly as experienced in the tactics of land's warfare.

10
00:00:34.130 --> 00:00:37.880
If the period as the battle Hodgkin's armies of continental Europe,

11
00:00:37.970 --> 00:00:39.770
but the tactics of war were changing.

12
00:00:39.800 --> 00:00:43.970
The ban has said musket was replacing the pike as a standard infantry weapon.

13
00:00:44.150 --> 00:00:48.350
The firepower of muskets and cannons was increasing and the concept of organized

14
00:00:48.351 --> 00:00:50.330
supply chains was being refined.

15
00:00:50.360 --> 00:00:53.990
So armies could be kept in the field for much longer periods of time.

16
00:00:54.050 --> 00:00:58.850
No one took better advantage of these new tactics to win glory for himself and

17
00:00:58.851 --> 00:01:01.550
his country than John Churchill that you have.

18
00:01:01.551 --> 00:01:05.810
Marlboro Marlboro was one of the first generals to master the art of leading a

19
00:01:05.811 --> 00:01:09.740
coalition army from multiple different countries and were celebrated for his

20
00:01:09.741 --> 00:01:14.270
tactical genius and for his organizational skills that made his army one of the

21
00:01:14.271 --> 00:01:18.020
most dangerous in Europe. He was also a natural born political animal,

22
00:01:18.110 --> 00:01:22.370
rising to his heinie station in no small part due to his powerful friends,

23
00:01:22.371 --> 00:01:24.980
including royalty. He would eventually be undone,

24
00:01:24.981 --> 00:01:26.780
not by defeat on the battlefields,

25
00:01:26.781 --> 00:01:31.130
but by political backstabbing at home brought on by his own ruthless

26
00:01:31.131 --> 00:01:32.990
maneuvering, regardless of his faults,

27
00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:37.280
he is still recognized today as a crucial figure in British and European history

28
00:01:37.430 --> 00:01:42.230
whose actions both on and off the battlefield continue to be felt even 300

29
00:01:42.231 --> 00:01:43.064
years.

30
00:01:49.070 --> 00:01:49.160
<v 1>[Inaudible].</v>

31
00:01:49.160 --> 00:01:52.100
<v 0>John Churchill was born on may the 26th, 1650,</v>

32
00:01:52.250 --> 00:01:55.550
and his grandmother's house in Devon in Southwest England, his father.

33
00:01:55.580 --> 00:02:00.080
So Winston Churchill had force on the royalist side and the recently concluded

34
00:02:00.081 --> 00:02:00.920
English civil war.

35
00:02:01.190 --> 00:02:05.480
There are lists that lost and King Charles had been deposed and executed the

36
00:02:05.481 --> 00:02:06.080
year before.

37
00:02:06.080 --> 00:02:10.370
And the victorious parliamentarians punish those who had served the broader list

38
00:02:10.760 --> 00:02:13.820
cause with heavy sanctions, including fines, so steep that it forced.

39
00:02:13.821 --> 00:02:16.520
So Winston's moving with his mother-in-law.

40
00:02:16.640 --> 00:02:20.420
The Churchill family fortunately has turned around in 1660 when the monarchy was

41
00:02:20.421 --> 00:02:23.330
restored and the Prince of Wales was crowned King Charles.

42
00:02:23.331 --> 00:02:24.710
The second five years later,

43
00:02:24.740 --> 00:02:29.180
John's older sister R Abella was made a maid of honor to the Duchess of York and

44
00:02:29.690 --> 00:02:33.080
height. And his husband, James, the Duke of York was King Charles, his brother,

45
00:02:33.081 --> 00:02:35.090
and after the Thrones of England and Scotland,

46
00:02:35.270 --> 00:02:38.000
James was smitten by the 17 year old Arab Eller.

47
00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:41.540
And she became his mistress and arrangement that lasted over a decade and

48
00:02:41.541 --> 00:02:45.500
produced for illegitimate children as was customary for the time James rewarded

49
00:02:45.501 --> 00:02:48.830
the church or family with patronage and John and his brothers were given

50
00:02:48.831 --> 00:02:50.270
positions in the Royal households.

51
00:02:50.271 --> 00:02:54.410
And later in the military judge who got his first taste of battle in 1672,

52
00:02:54.411 --> 00:02:58.310
when England went to war against the Dutch Republic and an Alliance with France,

53
00:02:58.370 --> 00:03:00.700
he served the commands of the Duke of Monmouth,

54
00:03:00.850 --> 00:03:02.620
the illegitimate child of King Charles,

55
00:03:02.621 --> 00:03:04.750
the second and acquitted himself well in the field.

56
00:03:04.930 --> 00:03:09.190
He returned home in 1675 and soon, often at 15 year old, Sarah Jennings,

57
00:03:09.490 --> 00:03:12.040
another maid of honor in the raw court. And two years later,

58
00:03:12.041 --> 00:03:14.860
the two married in secret since neither of their families approved.

59
00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:15.833
<v 1>It's just a match.</v>

60
00:03:21.780 --> 00:03:24.600
<v 0>Throughout the sixties and seventies. It became clear that King Charles,</v>

61
00:03:24.601 --> 00:03:27.690
the second would not produce a legitimate at the throne,

62
00:03:27.691 --> 00:03:31.140
meanings that upon his death, the crown would go to his brother. James.

63
00:03:31.380 --> 00:03:33.750
The problem was James was a devout Catholic.

64
00:03:33.840 --> 00:03:37.410
There were fears that a Catholic King would try to force the country to convert

65
00:03:37.411 --> 00:03:39.420
and outlaw the Anglican church.

66
00:03:39.570 --> 00:03:42.270
It had been the Catholic sympathies of King Charles. The first,

67
00:03:42.300 --> 00:03:46.440
that was a major factor in inciting the English civil war that had deposed him

68
00:03:46.441 --> 00:03:47.250
years earlier.

69
00:03:47.250 --> 00:03:51.150
What to do about the succession precipitated a crisis that dominated English

70
00:03:51.180 --> 00:03:54.240
politics for over a decade King Charles supported his brother.

71
00:03:54.241 --> 00:03:57.090
And so did the church or family or not Catholic themselves.

72
00:03:57.091 --> 00:04:01.530
They owed their station to their friendship with James and so remains loyal to,

73
00:04:01.740 --> 00:04:04.380
and even as most of parliament turned against him,

74
00:04:04.500 --> 00:04:07.140
Sarah Churchill formed a friendship with James's daughter,

75
00:04:07.200 --> 00:04:11.160
and that would prove to be extremely influential in the years to come while John

76
00:04:11.161 --> 00:04:14.820
cultivated a friendship with James who succeeded to the throne upon the death of

77
00:04:14.821 --> 00:04:17.850
his brother in 1685. Soon after James, his coronation,

78
00:04:17.851 --> 00:04:21.210
the Duke of Monmouth lighter rebellion against him proclaiming himself King.

79
00:04:21.240 --> 00:04:24.330
He hoped to use the fact that he was a Protestant son of King Charles,

80
00:04:24.331 --> 00:04:27.390
or be it in a legitimate one to gain the throne for himself.

81
00:04:27.480 --> 00:04:31.680
King James sent the Royal army under the Allah Feversham to crush the rebellion.

82
00:04:31.710 --> 00:04:35.490
John Jojo was appointed second in commands and played a key role in the defeat

83
00:04:35.491 --> 00:04:40.260
of the Monmouth rebellion at the battle of [inaudible] on July the sixth, 1685.

84
00:04:40.320 --> 00:04:40.771
Soon though,

85
00:04:40.771 --> 00:04:44.430
it became clear that Protestant fears about King James were not groundless

86
00:04:44.850 --> 00:04:48.510
James' favorite Catholics and senior court positions and favorite policies that

87
00:04:48.690 --> 00:04:52.820
expressed toleration for Catholics, but not for other Protestant sects,

88
00:04:52.821 --> 00:04:54.270
such as Presbyterians.

89
00:04:54.300 --> 00:04:58.050
He was accused of being an absolute Monarch who did whatever he wanted,

90
00:04:58.200 --> 00:05:03.060
whether the people he ruled likes it or not is supported roaded steadily and

91
00:05:03.180 --> 00:05:04.950
were so low that in 1688,

92
00:05:04.980 --> 00:05:08.520
there was open dork of deposing him and replacing him with his daughter,

93
00:05:08.521 --> 00:05:10.950
Mary and her husband, William Prince of orange,

94
00:05:10.951 --> 00:05:14.700
the most powerful figure in the Dutch Republic in November 16, 88,

95
00:05:14.730 --> 00:05:17.640
William landed in England at the head of a large invasion force.

96
00:05:17.670 --> 00:05:21.660
James watched in horror as most of his Royal army deserted him to join the Dutch

97
00:05:22.200 --> 00:05:25.260
invaders. The majority of the English population welcomed William as a savior,

98
00:05:25.440 --> 00:05:28.050
both of his daughters, Mary and Anne turned against him.

99
00:05:28.080 --> 00:05:31.260
But the hardest portrayal to take was that of John Churchill.

100
00:05:31.350 --> 00:05:34.770
It turns out that he had been secretly plotting with William for months to

101
00:05:34.771 --> 00:05:39.390
depose James and as one of James senior commanders and trusted advisors knew

102
00:05:39.391 --> 00:05:41.790
what the King was planning and how to oppose it.

103
00:05:41.880 --> 00:05:44.970
Churchill deserted his gang and joined Williams. Soon after he landed,

104
00:05:45.060 --> 00:05:49.080
James fled the country in December and soon after William and Mary were crowned

105
00:05:49.081 --> 00:05:52.620
as joint monarchs, Churchill was rewarded by being made of Marlboro,

106
00:05:52.621 --> 00:05:56.520
but many people looked upon his desertion of James as a disgrace,

107
00:05:56.521 --> 00:06:01.040
effectively stabbing the man who had made his career in the back just for

108
00:06:01.041 --> 00:06:04.940
personal gain, more than anything. It demonstrated his ruthless ambition,

109
00:06:04.970 --> 00:06:08.300
which was to help and hinder him in equal parts in the yest.

110
00:06:15.480 --> 00:06:18.610
Mary never really trusted Marlboro rafter. They were crowns well after all,

111
00:06:18.611 --> 00:06:22.570
if he was willing to betray one Monarch who's to say he wouldn't betray another.

112
00:06:22.780 --> 00:06:24.370
If it's did to benefit him. In fact,

113
00:06:24.760 --> 00:06:27.880
Marlboro maintained a secret correspondence with the depose James through the

114
00:06:27.881 --> 00:06:28.870
1690s,

115
00:06:28.871 --> 00:06:33.010
which is viewed more as an insurance policy in case seat was restored to the

116
00:06:33.011 --> 00:06:33.460
throne.

117
00:06:33.460 --> 00:06:37.600
Marlboro was not an active supporter of James or Jacobite as they were called,

118
00:06:37.720 --> 00:06:40.420
but he was above all a practical man.

119
00:06:40.990 --> 00:06:43.510
Marlboro made other powerful friends in this time period, such as Sydney.

120
00:06:43.511 --> 00:06:47.560
Godolphin the first daughter of the treasury and Sarah who was now the favorite

121
00:06:47.561 --> 00:06:50.230
of princess. And it was next in line to the throne.

122
00:06:50.350 --> 00:06:52.900
Another reason the King and queen distrusted him,

123
00:06:53.050 --> 00:06:56.770
although recognized as an exemplary soldier has the vanity and inability to

124
00:06:56.920 --> 00:07:00.700
please as pneumonics would be as undoing in January, 1692,

125
00:07:00.970 --> 00:07:04.780
it was summarily dismissed from his officers and banished from the court.

126
00:07:04.780 --> 00:07:05.531
And in may,

127
00:07:05.531 --> 00:07:09.070
he was accused of being a signatory to a letter that outlined a plot to replace

128
00:07:09.071 --> 00:07:12.940
William with James. And he was sent to the tower of London after five weeks.

129
00:07:13.090 --> 00:07:16.240
Now that it was discredited as a forgery, as Marlboro was released,

130
00:07:16.300 --> 00:07:19.810
it took until 1698 for Marlboro to regain positions in the governments.

131
00:07:19.811 --> 00:07:22.480
Although he still has a cool relationship with the King,

132
00:07:22.630 --> 00:07:26.560
but it ends on the continents intervenes that would turn Marlboro into an

133
00:07:26.561 --> 00:07:30.070
international hero. And if you want to become an international hero,

134
00:07:30.310 --> 00:07:33.970
then it's time to start creating something amazing with today's sponsor

<v 2>[Inaudible].</v>

158
00:08:52.000 --> 00:08:55.860
<v 0>So politics of this period was dominated by a rivalry between the French house</v>

159
00:08:55.861 --> 00:08:58.440
of Borbon and the Austrian house of Habsburg,

160
00:08:58.500 --> 00:09:02.100
the bull bonds and ruled the kingdom of France since the late 16th century and

161
00:09:02.101 --> 00:09:06.090
the French King Louis the 14th was one of the most powerful and absolute

162
00:09:06.091 --> 00:09:08.760
monarchs in the world. He was also known as the sun King,

163
00:09:08.790 --> 00:09:11.400
not only because he took the image of the sun as a symbol,

164
00:09:11.401 --> 00:09:15.060
but because he made sure that all the froms revolved around him,

165
00:09:15.180 --> 00:09:19.230
perhaps bergs were an ancient family that controlled the Austrian and Hungarian

166
00:09:19.231 --> 00:09:19.950
monarchies,

167
00:09:19.950 --> 00:09:24.510
and also exercised control over much of Germany by essentially hereditary

168
00:09:24.511 --> 00:09:28.250
control of the throne of the Holy Roman empire. Under the Bronx shift,

169
00:09:28.260 --> 00:09:30.510
the Habsburgs controlled the Vos Spanish Ambar,

170
00:09:30.540 --> 00:09:34.170
which while it wasn't the powerhouse that at once was still controlled as much

171
00:09:34.171 --> 00:09:37.200
of the Americas, Southern Italy and the Spanish Netherlands,

172
00:09:37.201 --> 00:09:38.370
which is modern day Belgium.

173
00:09:38.610 --> 00:09:41.550
Most of the conflicts of this period were driven by the need to keep the balance

174
00:09:41.551 --> 00:09:45.600
of power between these great two powers with the other countries of Europe

175
00:09:45.601 --> 00:09:49.260
fighting each other one or the other intern in order to keep them in check.

176
00:09:49.320 --> 00:09:51.840
It was a complicated and violence system.

177
00:09:51.870 --> 00:09:55.020
But the only one that works in an age where monarchs were free to treat their

178
00:09:55.021 --> 00:09:58.440
nations like placings, that could go to war on a whim,

179
00:09:58.530 --> 00:10:02.070
a serious threat to the balance of power developed in 1700, the King of Spain,

180
00:10:02.071 --> 00:10:02.341
Charles,

181
00:10:02.341 --> 00:10:06.060
the second who had ruled for over 30 years was in the patchouli ill health

182
00:10:06.061 --> 00:10:10.590
likely caused by genetic deficiencies resulting from centuries of inbreeding.

183
00:10:10.860 --> 00:10:15.480
He was unable to produce some errands with no other close relatives to succeed

184
00:10:15.481 --> 00:10:15.931
in earth,

185
00:10:15.931 --> 00:10:20.370
the ball bonds and the Habsburgs competed bitterly with each other to take the

186
00:10:20.371 --> 00:10:22.950
power of Spain into their own fold.

187
00:10:23.040 --> 00:10:27.150
Something that would irrevocably tip the balance of power in favor of the Victor

188
00:10:27.240 --> 00:10:28.980
on November, the first 1700 Charles,

189
00:10:28.981 --> 00:10:32.670
the second diet as well left the throne of Spain's Phillip of Andrew,

190
00:10:32.671 --> 00:10:35.010
the grandson of King to be the 14th.

191
00:10:35.070 --> 00:10:39.120
The idea of the bull Barnes controlling both France and Spain was unacceptable

192
00:10:39.121 --> 00:10:42.840
to Holy Roman. Emperor Leopold ended horrified the rest of Europe,

193
00:10:42.841 --> 00:10:43.830
including King William.

194
00:10:43.920 --> 00:10:47.400
A grounds Alliance was formed in 1701 consisting of England's,

195
00:10:47.401 --> 00:10:51.750
the Dutch Republic and the Holy Roman empire to oppose Louise ambitions in

196
00:10:51.751 --> 00:10:55.110
Spain. What became known as the war of Spanish succession and beginning

197
00:11:02.290 --> 00:11:03.710
Third died in March,

198
00:11:03.710 --> 00:11:06.710
1702 from complications that developed from a fall from his horse.

199
00:11:06.920 --> 00:11:09.200
His sister-in-law was proclaimed queen Anne.

200
00:11:09.260 --> 00:11:13.730
Soon after Marlboro was made captain general of all English and Scottish forces

201
00:11:13.820 --> 00:11:16.760
and also made commander of deduction, high German armies as well.

202
00:11:16.970 --> 00:11:19.400
He now had a huge challenge ahead of him.

203
00:11:19.460 --> 00:11:23.270
He faced a French army that was considered the best in the world at the time

204
00:11:23.840 --> 00:11:26.390
commands ads by Louis the 14th best marshals.

205
00:11:26.570 --> 00:11:29.540
He also have to contend with an allied army with differing priorities and

206
00:11:29.541 --> 00:11:31.250
squabbling factions in parliaments at home.

207
00:11:31.490 --> 00:11:35.900
But it was this adversity that served to further showcase his brilliance in

208
00:11:35.901 --> 00:11:39.800
commands [inaudible] commands in the low countries where the war was to be

209
00:11:39.801 --> 00:11:40.730
principally forced,

210
00:11:40.880 --> 00:11:45.440
immediately outmaneuvered as opponents Marshall Bufala took four cities in the

211
00:11:45.441 --> 00:11:48.260
Netherlands, a grateful green mate and the Duke of Marlborough.

212
00:11:48.530 --> 00:11:51.380
But when he returns to war the next year, the French foiled,

213
00:11:51.410 --> 00:11:53.740
the allied designs for a quick to the war.

214
00:11:53.890 --> 00:11:58.660
And as Marlboro came under attack by the politics at home Marlboro was a Tory

215
00:11:58.661 --> 00:12:01.660
and they had control of the governments and had the favor of the queen.

216
00:12:02.020 --> 00:12:05.530
But many of his Tory colleagues thought that a Lamb's war was a waste of time

217
00:12:05.531 --> 00:12:06.970
and resources and this,

218
00:12:07.150 --> 00:12:11.050
they should devote their efforts instead do deploying the Royal Navy to attack

219
00:12:11.051 --> 00:12:13.810
France and Spain's overseas colonies and trade routes.

220
00:12:13.930 --> 00:12:17.320
By contrast the wigs headed by a group of powerful Lord schooled.

221
00:12:17.380 --> 00:12:21.790
The so were fully in support of the continental campaign and small-bore his

222
00:12:21.791 --> 00:12:23.380
son-in-law was a leading wig,

223
00:12:23.470 --> 00:12:27.670
but queen Anne hated the wigs and didn't want them in control of her ministry.

224
00:12:28.210 --> 00:12:31.240
Marlboro was now caught between bits of political rivals and had to play a

225
00:12:31.241 --> 00:12:34.030
delicate game in order to keep everyone happy,

226
00:12:34.180 --> 00:12:36.580
but he could do nothing if he lost the war.

227
00:12:36.700 --> 00:12:40.330
And when he returned to the field in 1704, he faced a crisis.

228
00:12:46.560 --> 00:12:50.100
The main thrust of the French war effort in 1704 was against Austria.

229
00:12:50.160 --> 00:12:53.940
The empire was hard-pressed by two French armies and a third commanded by

230
00:12:54.420 --> 00:12:56.610
Francis ally, the electorate Bavaria,

231
00:12:56.640 --> 00:13:00.540
they were advancing along the Danube river towards the Imperial capital of

232
00:13:00.541 --> 00:13:02.010
Vienna. If Deanna was taken,

233
00:13:02.011 --> 00:13:04.860
they would likely knock the Habsburgs out of the Warrens.

234
00:13:04.861 --> 00:13:08.970
The entire Alliance would collapse. Barbara knew he needed to save the Ana,

235
00:13:09.180 --> 00:13:12.240
but he also knew that the Dutch would never willingly allow him to leave their

236
00:13:12.241 --> 00:13:14.940
borders and weakened the defenses of their home country.

237
00:13:15.120 --> 00:13:16.860
So to get his army down the Danube,

238
00:13:16.890 --> 00:13:21.030
he decided to trig both his Dutch allies and his French opponents by pretending

239
00:13:21.031 --> 00:13:21.960
to March West,

240
00:13:22.170 --> 00:13:26.430
then abruptly turning South and floating his army on barges down the Rhine

241
00:13:26.431 --> 00:13:28.260
river, his deception worked.

242
00:13:28.320 --> 00:13:33.090
He was able to match a force of 40,000 men over 250 miles in five weeks while

243
00:13:33.091 --> 00:13:34.530
being completely unhindered.

244
00:13:34.620 --> 00:13:39.510
This Torrid pace was accomplished with spectacular logistics plans by Marlboro

245
00:13:39.690 --> 00:13:42.120
so that when his army arrived at the Danube,

246
00:13:42.330 --> 00:13:44.820
it was in a fit state to fight here.

247
00:13:44.821 --> 00:13:47.340
He met up with the commander of the Imperial army Prince,

248
00:13:47.341 --> 00:13:50.730
Eugene of Savoy and accomplished and Flamboyan general.

249
00:13:50.850 --> 00:13:54.270
He became Marlboro has great friends personally and professionally together.

250
00:13:54.271 --> 00:13:59.130
They faced off against the forces of marshals to lardons Mohsin and the lecture

251
00:13:59.140 --> 00:14:02.820
of Bavaria or in this time period was usually dominated by sieges,

252
00:14:02.850 --> 00:14:06.570
but Marlboro taking advantage of advances in technologies, such as the socket,

253
00:14:06.571 --> 00:14:09.480
bayonet sought to destroy his enemies in the field,

254
00:14:09.570 --> 00:14:12.600
proclaiming that one battle is worth 10 seizures,

255
00:14:12.630 --> 00:14:15.810
but the French were reluctant to find it first rating for reinforcement.

256
00:14:15.811 --> 00:14:19.740
So Marlboro resolved to attack them at that position near the small village

257
00:14:19.741 --> 00:14:22.830
known in English as Blenheim the allied plan was symbol.

258
00:14:22.860 --> 00:14:25.530
Eugene would attack the French position on the right flank,

259
00:14:25.560 --> 00:14:28.320
pinning them down at the same time. Some of Marlboro is force,

260
00:14:28.500 --> 00:14:30.000
which attack the village of Blenheim,

261
00:14:30.001 --> 00:14:33.780
which forms of the left flank with the two flanks pinned down Marlboro himself

262
00:14:33.781 --> 00:14:37.200
would crash through the center of the line with the main body of his army,

263
00:14:37.350 --> 00:14:39.120
dealing a deathly blow.

264
00:14:39.330 --> 00:14:42.870
The battle of Blenheim began with the simultaneous attacks on the French flanks

265
00:14:42.871 --> 00:14:43.704
at 1:00 PM.

266
00:14:43.830 --> 00:14:48.000
The battle unfolded just as Marlboro had hopes the vicious and bloody flank

267
00:14:48.001 --> 00:14:51.950
attacks had pinned down large numbers of French troops that were to reinforce

268
00:14:51.951 --> 00:14:53.060
the center of their battle line.

269
00:14:53.240 --> 00:14:56.240
More troops were pinned in the center in the hamlets of over Glau.

270
00:14:56.270 --> 00:15:00.680
Now Marlboro unleashed his hammer blow a massive combined wave of cavalry,

271
00:15:00.710 --> 00:15:05.450
infantry and artillery that cuts nine French battalions to pieces and sent the

272
00:15:05.510 --> 00:15:08.660
center of the French line. And two panicked flight.

273
00:15:09.020 --> 00:15:13.010
If a 3000 French are estimated to have drowned in the Danube during the routes,

274
00:15:13.070 --> 00:15:14.360
they took thousands more prisoners,

275
00:15:14.361 --> 00:15:18.350
including Marshall town off on the right to Eugene personally led an attack that

276
00:15:18.980 --> 00:15:23.750
overwhelms the Bavarian artillery battery and put Marston and the Alexa to

277
00:15:23.751 --> 00:15:27.620
flight. Then Marlboro turned his attention to the 10,000 soldiers.

278
00:15:27.621 --> 00:15:31.280
Now tramped in the village of Blenheim finally forcing them to surrender off to

279
00:15:31.281 --> 00:15:32.720
heavy fighting at 9:00 PM.

280
00:15:32.870 --> 00:15:37.790
It was a stunning victory from Abra and Eugene 27,000 French would dead

281
00:15:37.820 --> 00:15:41.270
wounded or captured compared with $12,000 casualties.

282
00:15:41.330 --> 00:15:44.720
All of the various we're seeing overrun and it's put under Austrian military

283
00:15:44.721 --> 00:15:48.350
rule knocking them out of the war and he made Marlboro the hero.

284
00:15:48.530 --> 00:15:50.000
He returns to London in December,

285
00:15:50.180 --> 00:15:54.080
and that's a triumphal procession to Westminster palace queen and allocated

286
00:15:54.081 --> 00:15:58.340
money to build a palatial estate Blenheim palace as a reward for his deed.

287
00:15:58.580 --> 00:16:00.110
It would be the high point of his career.

288
00:16:00.130 --> 00:16:00.963
<v 3>Yeah.</v>

289
00:16:06.910 --> 00:16:10.360
<v 0>Pain of 70 and nine five was not nearly as successful for Marlboro as he was</v>

290
00:16:10.480 --> 00:16:14.500
stymied by French resistance and the reluctance of the Dutch to leave their

291
00:16:14.501 --> 00:16:16.390
border defenses to attack the French.

292
00:16:16.660 --> 00:16:19.270
They gave him Arbor as Tory enemies at high ammunition to cool.

293
00:16:19.271 --> 00:16:22.900
Blenheim a flu cans, the land war, a waste of time. Meanwhile,

294
00:16:22.901 --> 00:16:25.120
the Queen's relationship with Sarah had chilled.

295
00:16:25.270 --> 00:16:30.010
Sarah was a staunch wig and campaigns tirelessly against the Tories irritating

296
00:16:30.011 --> 00:16:34.030
the queen 1786 did not start any better with the French making gains in all

297
00:16:34.031 --> 00:16:36.340
fronts. And the lack of allied support,

298
00:16:36.341 --> 00:16:39.910
forcing Marlboro to fight in the Spanish Netherlands instead of Germany or

299
00:16:39.940 --> 00:16:42.670
Italy, where he wanted to bolstered by a success Libby,

300
00:16:42.680 --> 00:16:46.840
the fourteens goaded Marshall Villeroy and leaving his defensive positions in

301
00:16:47.320 --> 00:16:48.550
Flanders to attack Marlboro,

302
00:16:48.580 --> 00:16:52.870
seeking to avenge Blenheim and perhaps forced the Dutch out of the war Marlboro

303
00:16:52.960 --> 00:16:56.620
and mess him at rental lays on may the 23rd and in a battle that took less than

304
00:16:56.621 --> 00:16:57.311
four hours,

305
00:16:57.311 --> 00:17:01.060
completely outmaneuvered and crushed the French inflicting 15 to 20,000

306
00:17:01.061 --> 00:17:05.860
casualties compared to 3,500 of his own though, not lauded as Blenheim.

307
00:17:05.890 --> 00:17:09.370
It was arguably his greatest victory of the walk strategically.

308
00:17:09.371 --> 00:17:11.470
It had great implications as well as malware.

309
00:17:11.590 --> 00:17:13.780
His forces captured most of the Spanish Netherlands,

310
00:17:13.781 --> 00:17:17.440
including the most important cities of Brussels Antwerp.

311
00:17:17.620 --> 00:17:21.970
And Bruge in 1,707. Marlboro was unable to win a victory on the battlefield,

312
00:17:22.000 --> 00:17:25.570
but he achieved one diplomatically. He successfully bribed Cole Piper,

313
00:17:25.600 --> 00:17:26.500
one of King, Charles,

314
00:17:26.501 --> 00:17:30.280
the 12th of Sweden's chief advisors in return for Piper persuading,

315
00:17:30.281 --> 00:17:34.450
Charles to launch an attack on Russia instead of interfering in the war between

316
00:17:34.480 --> 00:17:38.980
the Alliance and France in 1708, he was joined in Flanders by his friend,

317
00:17:38.981 --> 00:17:40.600
Prince Eugene, and together,

318
00:17:40.660 --> 00:17:43.420
they won another great victory over the French that we did not.

319
00:17:43.540 --> 00:17:47.740
They advanced through the Spanish Netherlands towards France itself in 1709 in

320
00:17:47.741 --> 00:17:49.680
one of the bloodiest battles of the war.

321
00:17:49.800 --> 00:17:52.320
They beat the French again at [inaudible],

322
00:17:52.440 --> 00:17:56.460
but the affair was a bloody one and the allies suffered twice as many casualties

323
00:17:56.461 --> 00:17:57.150
as the French.

324
00:17:57.150 --> 00:18:00.990
It was to be the last great victory of the war for the remarkable partnership

325
00:18:01.140 --> 00:18:03.960
between Marlboro and Eugene at home though,

326
00:18:03.990 --> 00:18:07.950
things were turning to disaster from Arbor as chief ally and the government Nord

327
00:18:07.951 --> 00:18:11.700
Godolphin had been forced to Cobell the queen to share power with the wig Shinto

328
00:18:11.880 --> 00:18:15.810
permanently fracturing the relationship between the mulberries and en the queen

329
00:18:15.930 --> 00:18:18.630
it's ends when you favored Abigail mash and Sarah's cousin,

330
00:18:18.631 --> 00:18:19.830
and to Robert Holley,

331
00:18:19.890 --> 00:18:22.680
a former ally of Marlborough who had now turned against him.

332
00:18:22.830 --> 00:18:25.710
The Tories looked on the power sharing scheme as a betrayal.

333
00:18:25.711 --> 00:18:28.050
And when they assumed power in 17, 10,

334
00:18:28.080 --> 00:18:31.710
the wigs were swept from governments and good orphan went with them. Now,

335
00:18:31.711 --> 00:18:33.300
Holly and the Tories went off to Marlborough.

336
00:18:33.330 --> 00:18:36.810
They trumped up corruption charges against him that he was stealing public

337
00:18:36.811 --> 00:18:38.880
money, meant for the army for his own profits.

338
00:18:38.881 --> 00:18:41.370
And in December of 1711 queen Anne,

339
00:18:41.400 --> 00:18:45.540
who by now had turned on Sarah completely dismissed her undefeated commander

340
00:18:45.570 --> 00:18:46.403
from his post.

341
00:18:52.550 --> 00:18:52.910
<v 4>[Inaudible].</v>

342
00:18:52.910 --> 00:18:55.780
<v 0>Members of the grands and lines with stunned by Mulberry is dismissal.</v>

343
00:18:55.970 --> 00:18:59.180
And even more shocked when it was discovered that the British government had

344
00:18:59.181 --> 00:19:01.940
been hosting secret talks with the French for months beforehand,

345
00:19:02.120 --> 00:19:05.690
to secure a favorable terms for themselves at the expense of everyone else.

346
00:19:05.720 --> 00:19:06.650
The treaty of ULTRAX,

347
00:19:06.651 --> 00:19:10.910
which ended British participation in the war was heavily slanted in favor of the

348
00:19:10.911 --> 00:19:13.400
British and did little to nothing for the rest of the allies.

349
00:19:13.640 --> 00:19:17.390
It kept Phillip as King of Spain in exchange for his formal renunciation of the

350
00:19:17.391 --> 00:19:19.880
French throne, which maintains the balance power in Europe.

351
00:19:19.910 --> 00:19:23.210
It established great Britain as the country was now cooled off to the act of

352
00:19:23.211 --> 00:19:26.420
union in 1707, nudged England and Scotland into one nation.

353
00:19:26.690 --> 00:19:28.670
As the dominant commercial power in the world,

354
00:19:28.700 --> 00:19:30.530
some of its effects are still felt today.

355
00:19:30.710 --> 00:19:34.220
The United Kingdom still controls the port of Gibraltar seeded to Britain by

356
00:19:34.221 --> 00:19:37.280
Spain and the treaty of old tracks for Marlboro. However,

357
00:19:37.490 --> 00:19:39.170
the peace was a bitter pill to swallow.

358
00:19:39.370 --> 00:19:42.680
It had been largely responsible for British success in the world only to be

359
00:19:42.681 --> 00:19:44.630
brought down by political infighting,

360
00:19:44.930 --> 00:19:49.130
but really he had no one but himself to blame his attempt to play both sides to

361
00:19:49.131 --> 00:19:53.150
his own benefit of back font and his inability to convince his wife, Sarah,

362
00:19:53.151 --> 00:19:57.650
to be more subtle in her politicking and less haughty had alienated them both

363
00:19:57.651 --> 00:20:02.540
from queen Anne Marlboro went into self-imposed exile on the continent in 1712.

364
00:20:02.750 --> 00:20:06.620
It was still immensely popular in Germany and Austria and traveled extensively

365
00:20:06.770 --> 00:20:09.950
over the next two years, Marlboro was to play King Maaco. One more time.

366
00:20:09.951 --> 00:20:10.310
However,

367
00:20:10.310 --> 00:20:14.840
queen Anne has no living heirs and as the act of settlement passed in 1701 ruled

368
00:20:14.841 --> 00:20:17.150
Catholics to be ineligible to inherit the throne,

369
00:20:17.270 --> 00:20:20.660
the closest Protestant relative was the elector of Hanover, George Lewis.

370
00:20:20.720 --> 00:20:24.140
However, the Jacobites still hope to restore the ad to King James to the throne.

371
00:20:24.140 --> 00:20:27.860
Instead it felt a Marlboro to assure a smooth transition for George.

372
00:20:27.861 --> 00:20:32.450
When queen Anne died on August the first 1714 King George, the first was crowns.

373
00:20:32.570 --> 00:20:36.410
The Jacobites were defeated when they Rose in rebellion and all seemed well for

374
00:20:36.500 --> 00:20:38.420
the Marbury's. But in 1716,

375
00:20:38.540 --> 00:20:42.080
the Duke had the first of a series of strokes that would PSAP his health and

376
00:20:42.081 --> 00:20:45.440
force him to retire from public life. He watched as his enemy,

377
00:20:45.710 --> 00:20:49.420
Robert Harley was stripped of his officers and briefly imprisoned and oversaw

378
00:20:49.421 --> 00:20:53.020
the construction of Blenheim palace on June the 16th, 1722,

379
00:20:53.320 --> 00:20:56.080
following another stroke. He died age 72.

380
00:20:56.260 --> 00:20:59.170
He was given a state funeral and was buried in Westminster Abbey.

381
00:20:59.320 --> 00:21:03.370
Although his remains were later removed to lie next to his wife at the chapel at

382
00:21:03.371 --> 00:21:06.370
Blenheim palace, which was finished after the Duke's death.

383
00:21:06.490 --> 00:21:08.560
The palace is one of the largest States in Britain,

384
00:21:08.561 --> 00:21:10.060
not owned by the Royal family,

385
00:21:10.061 --> 00:21:13.870
the ancestral home of the Churchill family and the Dukes of Marlboro for the

386
00:21:13.871 --> 00:21:18.070
last 300 years. It was at Blenheim in 1874, that Winston Churchill was born.

387
00:21:18.071 --> 00:21:21.520
This direct descendants of the Duke would go on of course,

388
00:21:21.521 --> 00:21:24.250
to become the most famous prime minister in the country's history.

389
00:21:24.430 --> 00:21:27.700
If you have Marlboro was one of the most inspired commanders in European

390
00:21:27.701 --> 00:21:28.210
history.

391
00:21:28.210 --> 00:21:31.930
He routinely outfoxed and out fought his opponents on the battlefield and his

392
00:21:31.931 --> 00:21:35.380
talents for coalition building and logistics were just as important.

393
00:21:35.650 --> 00:21:37.900
And its victories, his partnership with Prince Eugene,

394
00:21:37.901 --> 00:21:39.400
a great general in his own right,

395
00:21:39.580 --> 00:21:43.540
provided a series of stunning victories that checks the power of the sun King

396
00:21:43.720 --> 00:21:47.140
and to help to facilitate Britain's rise to prominence in the 18th century,

397
00:21:47.230 --> 00:21:48.063
if he had a fault,

398
00:21:48.220 --> 00:21:51.970
it was his aggressive politicking and ambitions or rise to power in the first

399
00:21:51.971 --> 00:21:56.470
place, though, it's hard to argue with his results once he got there after all,

400
00:21:56.471 --> 00:22:00.610
not everyone wins about also thoroughly that you're given a palace named after

401
00:22:00.611 --> 00:22:03.310
it. So I really hope you found that video. Interesting. If you did,
