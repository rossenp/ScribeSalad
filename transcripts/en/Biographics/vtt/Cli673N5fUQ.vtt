00:00:02.971 --> 00:00:05.640
check out the game through the link in the description below,

3
00:00:05.940 --> 00:00:09.270
and you can start with three extra weapons or a vehicle cabin just for

00:00:09.271 --> 00:00:11.190
registering more on them in a box

5
00:00:17.480 --> 00:00:19.070
In the dying days of the 20th century,

6
00:00:19.071 --> 00:00:23.300
a strange and terrifying plague began to cough a path through Britain.

7
00:00:23.630 --> 00:00:25.130
We're not talking about HIV.

8
00:00:25.160 --> 00:00:28.520
The virus that caused such devastation across the globe in the eighties and

9
00:00:28.521 --> 00:00:29.300
nineties,

10
00:00:29.300 --> 00:00:34.130
we're talking instead about something far more sinister and epidemic

11
00:00:34.190 --> 00:00:38.810
that should never have happened. Bovine spongiform encephalopathy,

12
00:00:38.840 --> 00:00:42.620
better known as BSE or by its nickname. Mad cow disease.

13
00:00:42.650 --> 00:00:46.640
First appeared on a British farm around Christmas, 1984 in no time at all.

14
00:00:46.641 --> 00:00:50.180
It had spread first to herds across the country and then into the human food

15
00:00:50.181 --> 00:00:53.810
chain. The results would be catastrophic starting in 1996,

16
00:00:53.811 --> 00:00:58.310
nearly 240 people would be struck down by variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease.

17
00:00:58.311 --> 00:01:01.190
The human form of BRC one by one,

18
00:01:01.191 --> 00:01:04.610
the victim's relatives were forced to watch as the plague devoured their loved

19
00:01:04.910 --> 00:01:05.391
one's minds.

20
00:01:05.391 --> 00:01:10.160
Eventually leaving only a tortured husk fatal in 100% of

21
00:01:10.161 --> 00:01:14.570
cases, its detection was a death sentence rather than occurring. Naturally,

22
00:01:14.571 --> 00:01:17.210
this was a disease with a very human origin.

23
00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:21.920
One only made possible by a terrifying collision of corporate greed government

24
00:01:21.921 --> 00:01:25.760
malfeasance and share callous stupidity.

25
00:01:26.030 --> 00:01:29.630
Today biographics is investigating the story of BRC.

26
00:01:29.900 --> 00:01:32.300
The deadly plague created by men

27
00:01:38.740 --> 00:01:40.820
Where it's most associated with the 1990s.

28
00:01:40.821 --> 00:01:43.520
The story of BSE actually begins a long time ago,

29
00:01:43.730 --> 00:01:46.100
nor does it actually begin with a cow.

30
00:01:46.190 --> 00:01:51.020
Instead it starts on a British farm in 1732 with one on lucky sheep.

31
00:01:51.140 --> 00:01:54.740
Sadly, we don't know enough about what happens at paint you a verbal picture.

32
00:01:54.741 --> 00:01:59.300
We can't open this section with it was a dark and stormy nice or

33
00:01:59.480 --> 00:02:01.340
anything else, suitably autonomous,

34
00:02:01.370 --> 00:02:04.460
but we can say how it must've looked to the farmer.

35
00:02:04.610 --> 00:02:06.530
His long forgotten sheep would have been anxious.

36
00:02:06.531 --> 00:02:09.680
Delirious its head would have jittered from side to side,

37
00:02:09.710 --> 00:02:12.320
making it a pet possessed before long.

38
00:02:12.500 --> 00:02:14.240
It would have become unsteady on its feet.

39
00:02:14.270 --> 00:02:18.980
Started arching its back and scraping and Spalding along stone walls tearing out

40
00:02:18.981 --> 00:02:22.100
its world. Finally, a maximum of six months down the line,

41
00:02:22.340 --> 00:02:23.930
it would have died in agony.

42
00:02:24.140 --> 00:02:27.830
Not long after other sheep would have begun showing signs of the same awful

43
00:02:27.831 --> 00:02:29.540
disease known as scrapey.

44
00:02:29.540 --> 00:02:33.380
The blight eventually affected untold numbers of sheep first across Britain,

45
00:02:33.560 --> 00:02:36.110
and then across most of the rest of the world.

46
00:02:36.140 --> 00:02:39.410
But this being the early 18th century, people were all like,

47
00:02:39.940 --> 00:02:44.720
it's still food and they ate the dead and infected sheep and it didn't

48
00:02:44.721 --> 00:02:46.340
cause many problems to this day.

49
00:02:46.341 --> 00:02:49.610
There's no evidence that scrapey couldn't jump the species barrier.

50
00:02:49.910 --> 00:02:52.250
Unfortunately, this would cause a major issue.

51
00:02:52.370 --> 00:02:55.010
Some 250 years down the line.

52
00:02:55.040 --> 00:02:58.640
When the first cattle started showing signs of BRC in the mid 1980s,

53
00:02:58.850 --> 00:03:01.900
it be because of humanity's experience with scrapey.

54
00:03:02.080 --> 00:03:04.960
This ineffective beef was declared safety eat,

55
00:03:05.170 --> 00:03:07.000
but before we get to that part of our story,

56
00:03:07.150 --> 00:03:11.080
we have to make another pit stop cut to the 1920s. It's the era of jazz.

57
00:03:11.081 --> 00:03:14.140
Everyone's dressed like they're in the great Gatsby and a toothbrush.

58
00:03:14.141 --> 00:03:18.490
Mustache is still in legitimate fashion choice in the shadows though,

59
00:03:18.850 --> 00:03:23.380
a new disease is growing Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease or CJD is a

60
00:03:23.381 --> 00:03:24.760
degenerative brain disease.

61
00:03:24.760 --> 00:03:29.350
That's both super deadly and super rare effecting only one in a million

62
00:03:29.351 --> 00:03:29.980
people.

63
00:03:29.980 --> 00:03:34.360
But what made it extra fascinating for the 1920s doctors was the way it

64
00:03:34.990 --> 00:03:38.680
worked. See the surface of our brains, the covet in proteins called prions.

65
00:03:38.830 --> 00:03:42.700
What CJD does is fold these premiums in a weird way.

66
00:03:42.910 --> 00:03:47.500
These weird folded proteins, then lashed together to form toxic chains.

67
00:03:47.710 --> 00:03:50.680
As these chains grow, break apart and grow again,

68
00:03:50.830 --> 00:03:54.970
they spread across the brain killing cells and leaving sponge-like holes.

69
00:03:55.090 --> 00:03:57.490
But because the proteins are a natural part of us,

70
00:03:57.700 --> 00:04:01.120
our immune system doesn't identify them as something worth attacking,

71
00:04:01.390 --> 00:04:02.770
but someone infected with C J D.

72
00:04:02.771 --> 00:04:05.860
This means a steady decrease in mental functions and motor skills.

73
00:04:06.040 --> 00:04:07.450
There's confusion, anxiety,

74
00:04:07.451 --> 00:04:12.070
and difficulty walking that soon progresses into serious disability within a few

75
00:04:12.071 --> 00:04:13.360
months you'll debt.

76
00:04:13.810 --> 00:04:17.260
And there's no way to stop it since its discovery in the 1920s,

77
00:04:17.261 --> 00:04:20.890
C J D has been with us pretty consistently. Most years,

78
00:04:20.891 --> 00:04:23.350
around 350 Americans die from it,

79
00:04:23.410 --> 00:04:28.360
but it would be events in the 1990s that brought CJD firmly into

80
00:04:28.361 --> 00:04:29.170
the spotlight.

81
00:04:29.170 --> 00:04:33.520
The final piece of setup we need for up story today came around the same time

82
00:04:33.670 --> 00:04:35.980
that C J D was discovered. At some point,

83
00:04:35.981 --> 00:04:40.000
farmers realized they could get more profit from an animal by letting literally

84
00:04:40.030 --> 00:04:44.110
none of it go to waste the grim bits like spinal cord and all the leftovers

85
00:04:44.111 --> 00:04:45.190
could be rendered down,

86
00:04:45.310 --> 00:04:49.510
mulched up and fed back to other animals as feed grosses. The sounds,

87
00:04:49.660 --> 00:04:53.080
it was a major breakthrough animals that consumed the shredded remains of their

88
00:04:53.081 --> 00:04:56.920
brethren tended to grow bigger and faster than others. By the 1980s,

89
00:04:56.921 --> 00:04:59.890
this barnyard cannibalism had spread across the planet,

90
00:05:00.040 --> 00:05:01.750
revolutionizing food production.

91
00:05:01.990 --> 00:05:05.890
Now it was about to cause the biggest food contamination crisis in British

92
00:05:05.891 --> 00:05:06.724
history.

93
00:05:12.600 --> 00:05:12.750
<v 2>Sure.</v>

94
00:05:12.750 --> 00:05:16.860
<v 0>Way before Christmas day, 1984, David B got the call that would change his life.</v>

95
00:05:16.920 --> 00:05:21.090
The local vet in his part of Sussex B was famous among his neighbors for his

96
00:05:21.091 --> 00:05:22.920
pleasant singing voice. Soon though,

97
00:05:23.430 --> 00:05:26.880
it'd be known for a very different reason on a farm moons by Peter stent,

98
00:05:26.881 --> 00:05:31.650
a cow was dangerously sick with no one knew when he examined it.

99
00:05:31.680 --> 00:05:35.180
He found the cow had unsteady legs and arched back and ahead.

100
00:05:35.190 --> 00:05:36.690
That was wobbling from side to side.

101
00:05:36.810 --> 00:05:40.050
It wasn't the first in the area to Australia symptoms just recently.

102
00:05:40.051 --> 00:05:43.440
One of B's veterinary friends that told him if a cow that trying to chase them

103
00:05:43.441 --> 00:05:46.470
on legs. So weak that he'd have to run on its knees boss.

104
00:05:46.500 --> 00:05:50.010
This was the first time B had seen this weird new illness op close.

105
00:05:50.370 --> 00:05:52.260
And he didn't like what he saw at all.

106
00:05:52.320 --> 00:05:55.530
The closest thing to the symptoms he could think of was mercury poisoning,

107
00:05:55.531 --> 00:05:59.510
but how the hell would a single get poisons out on a random farm?

108
00:05:59.600 --> 00:06:03.380
So they kept an eye on the animal. And when it died in February, 1985,

109
00:06:03.381 --> 00:06:08.180
he contacted the UK central veterinary laboratory, the CVL. Then on September,

110
00:06:08.210 --> 00:06:13.040
the CVL examines the brain of cow 133 and founds the telltale sponge-like

111
00:06:13.041 --> 00:06:17.120
holes of Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease. They named this new council version,

112
00:06:17.240 --> 00:06:21.920
bovine spongiform encephalopathy or BSC belly had they

113
00:06:21.921 --> 00:06:23.060
identified the illness.

114
00:06:23.270 --> 00:06:26.480
Then it began cropping up everywhere over the next two years,

115
00:06:26.960 --> 00:06:28.250
BSE spread across the South of England.

116
00:06:28.400 --> 00:06:32.840
Six positive cases were confirmed alongside 13 suspected ones in the CVL

117
00:06:32.870 --> 00:06:33.710
discussions done.

118
00:06:33.711 --> 00:06:36.830
So where the scrapey had jumped the species barrier from sheep to cows,

119
00:06:37.220 --> 00:06:40.280
there was even talk about getting more researchers involved,

120
00:06:40.430 --> 00:06:42.680
but the powers that be put a stop to that,

121
00:06:42.860 --> 00:06:44.750
a governmental memo from the time red,

122
00:06:44.840 --> 00:06:47.900
if the disease turned out to be bovine scrapey is going to have a severe

123
00:06:47.901 --> 00:06:50.570
repercussions to the export trade at present,

124
00:06:50.660 --> 00:06:54.260
I would recommend playing it low key. And these two sentences,

125
00:06:54.560 --> 00:06:59.480
you can see the diseased heart of the BSE crisis. It was the 1980s.

126
00:06:59.570 --> 00:07:01.910
Agriculture was a huge part of Britain's economy.

127
00:07:01.970 --> 00:07:04.460
A health scare could cost the country billions.

128
00:07:04.580 --> 00:07:09.200
So officials were incentivized to keep quiet about a potential crisis as 1997

129
00:07:09.201 --> 00:07:11.240
dawned no one said a word.

130
00:07:11.570 --> 00:07:14.630
They kept silent as the number of cases jumped to 46.

131
00:07:14.631 --> 00:07:19.100
That August then 73 than 120, by the end of October,

132
00:07:19.190 --> 00:07:23.000
the first reports were appearing in the farming press about a deadly new cattle

133
00:07:23.001 --> 00:07:26.030
blight. But by then it was too late.

134
00:07:26.270 --> 00:07:29.870
Remember how we said that farm is in the mid 20th century had started feeding

135
00:07:29.900 --> 00:07:33.290
unusable bits of data animal back to that livestock. Well,

136
00:07:33.320 --> 00:07:36.200
they were now doing the same with BSE infected cows,

137
00:07:36.440 --> 00:07:39.290
but no longer was the mulch just going to other cattle.

138
00:07:39.560 --> 00:07:43.400
Mechanically recovered meat is a euphemism for all the gruesome bits of animal

139
00:07:43.580 --> 00:07:45.680
that no one wants to eat in the 1980s,

140
00:07:45.710 --> 00:07:49.310
someone hits on the idea of putting it into human products.

141
00:07:49.490 --> 00:07:53.420
This being the Thatcher era regulation was light. Whiter was all like, Hey,

142
00:07:53.421 --> 00:07:56.540
you want to feed spinal cord to children? Sure. Sounds like fun.

143
00:07:56.720 --> 00:08:00.500
So this mechanically recovered meat made from the most infectious parts of BSC

144
00:08:01.010 --> 00:08:05.390
castle was recycled into sausages into pies and do anything the industry you

145
00:08:05.391 --> 00:08:08.810
could get away with by the time the press started reporting on BSC,

146
00:08:09.140 --> 00:08:10.370
the ship had already sailed.

147
00:08:10.940 --> 00:08:15.290
Gibbons were eating infected meat by the millions and it's nobody had any idea

148
00:08:15.650 --> 00:08:19.510
what would happen next. Now you get into what exactly does happen next.

149
00:08:19.690 --> 00:08:22.270
Let me tell you about today's sponsor cross out,

150
00:08:22.300 --> 00:08:26.050
cross out as a fantastic game where you build your own vehicle and you pick

151
00:08:26.051 --> 00:08:28.780
yourself against other people's vehicles.

152
00:08:29.020 --> 00:08:30.760
Now this isn't one of those games where it's like, yeah,

153
00:08:30.880 --> 00:08:31.750
you get to build a vehicle,

154
00:08:31.900 --> 00:08:36.370
but you just get to choose the type of ammo and maybe what sort of tires go on

155
00:08:36.550 --> 00:08:38.590
your craft. No. And cross out,

156
00:08:38.740 --> 00:08:42.160
you get to build everything from the main structure up.

157
00:08:42.220 --> 00:08:44.530
You can stick on some rail guns at rocket booster.

158
00:08:44.531 --> 00:08:47.260
Some armor runs well without you're ready to fight,

159
00:08:47.261 --> 00:08:49.720
but there's loads of other stuff you can tug on as well.

160
00:08:49.721 --> 00:08:53.020
If you build your craft, well, you're going to dominate. If you build it badly.

161
00:08:53.021 --> 00:08:55.620
Well, you're probably going to get dominated.

162
00:08:55.950 --> 00:08:58.470
It's a super fast paced game with loads of different game modes,

163
00:08:58.471 --> 00:09:00.690
and you've got pretty much limitless freedom to create.

164
00:09:00.691 --> 00:09:03.300
And what you do with your vehicle is entirely up to you.

165
00:09:03.301 --> 00:09:06.390
Also a major plus is that the game's not complicated, right? From the start.

166
00:09:06.391 --> 00:09:10.920
You can just jump in and get going right away without too much trouble.

167
00:09:10.921 --> 00:09:13.650
But there's also lots of skills to build. As you get better at the game,

168
00:09:13.770 --> 00:09:16.830
you already begin to understand this and builds more complex things.

169
00:09:16.831 --> 00:09:20.880
The game grows with you. So join us on the battlefield for free, by the way,

170
00:09:20.910 --> 00:09:25.650
did I mention that the game is free PC Xbox one, PS4 easy.

171
00:09:25.651 --> 00:09:26.970
And if you go through the link below,

172
00:09:26.971 --> 00:09:30.210
you get a free starter set with three extra weapons or a vehicle cabin,

173
00:09:30.450 --> 00:09:30.750
all this,

174
00:09:30.750 --> 00:09:34.320
just a bonus for registering and doing that is a great way to support what we're

175
00:09:34.321 --> 00:09:36.030
doing here at biographics. And.

176
00:09:36.530 --> 00:09:37.460
<v 2>Let's get back to the video.</v>

177
00:09:44.690 --> 00:09:47.600
<v 0>1988, 200 new cases of BSE were being reported every week,</v>

178
00:09:48.050 --> 00:09:51.020
effecting 6,000 British farms to the British government's credits.

179
00:09:51.110 --> 00:09:52.850
They did try to act that same year.

180
00:09:52.851 --> 00:09:56.210
The practice of feeding animal remains to other animals was banned.

181
00:09:56.270 --> 00:09:56.931
The following year,

182
00:09:56.931 --> 00:10:00.230
the use of mechanically recovered meat in human foods was outlawed,

183
00:10:00.350 --> 00:10:02.330
but that was where the positive action ended.

184
00:10:02.570 --> 00:10:05.570
More than a million impacted castle were already in the human food chain.

185
00:10:05.810 --> 00:10:09.920
Burgers steak joins of roasting beef, or could be carrying this disease.

186
00:10:10.100 --> 00:10:12.620
The governments had two choices. They either recalled the Meese,

187
00:10:12.800 --> 00:10:17.090
told people to avoid beef and watch the agriculture industry employed,

188
00:10:17.360 --> 00:10:21.410
or they just acted like nothing had happened and just hoped for the best it was

189
00:10:21.411 --> 00:10:25.760
at this point that 1732 reached across the centuries to deliver the presence,

190
00:10:25.940 --> 00:10:29.930
a devastating kick to the testicles. BSE looked like scrapey.

191
00:10:30.110 --> 00:10:33.830
And since scrape had been around since 1732 without infecting humans,

192
00:10:34.040 --> 00:10:37.310
officials assumed BSC would act in exactly the same way.

193
00:10:37.400 --> 00:10:39.650
It was a decision based, not on science,

194
00:10:39.710 --> 00:10:44.120
but assumption on that would turn out to be catastrophically misjudged.

195
00:10:44.330 --> 00:10:47.180
Not that the public would be told this in 1990,

196
00:10:47.181 --> 00:10:48.530
the food and agriculture minister,

197
00:10:48.560 --> 00:10:52.070
John Gummer began a media blitz to get Brits eating beef. Again,

198
00:10:52.280 --> 00:10:55.100
a massive full-page ad vote was taken out in the major papers,

199
00:10:55.220 --> 00:10:59.150
declaring and bowls. Taxed beef is safe on TV.

200
00:10:59.510 --> 00:11:02.780
Gummer repeated the message saying British beef could be eaten by adults and

201
00:11:02.781 --> 00:11:07.570
children without worry at no point did he add, I mean, I guess I seriously,

202
00:11:07.640 --> 00:11:12.110
you guys are just, you know, make it assumptions really, but boldly very,

203
00:11:12.111 --> 00:11:12.980
very boldly.

204
00:11:13.340 --> 00:11:16.940
<v 3>There is no need for people to be worried. And I can say perfectly honestly,</v>

205
00:11:16.941 --> 00:11:21.350
that I should go on. Each of these children would go on each [inaudible].

206
00:11:21.830 --> 00:11:24.020
<v 0>No, the talking point was beef is safe.</v>

207
00:11:24.200 --> 00:11:27.530
Anyone who says otherwise is a science hating a Luddite,

208
00:11:27.680 --> 00:11:30.740
not the science itself agreed that same year 1990,

209
00:11:30.741 --> 00:11:33.650
Dr. Steven [inaudible] was conducting some worrying experiments.

210
00:11:33.800 --> 00:11:37.910
He had shown that unlike scrapey BSC could be used to infect mice in

211
00:11:37.911 --> 00:11:40.190
laboratories, but when he tried to speak out,

212
00:11:40.310 --> 00:11:44.720
he was removed from his post and reassigned to a lowly station where he couldn't

213
00:11:44.721 --> 00:11:48.380
conduct further research. Meanwhile, John Gaman took a break from photo ops,

214
00:11:48.381 --> 00:11:52.310
eating steak topped off to go on TV and to cues orange scientists of

215
00:11:52.311 --> 00:11:56.650
scare-mongering looking back now, it's weird. Just how Soviet this all sounds.

216
00:11:56.740 --> 00:11:57.760
The official denials,

217
00:11:57.790 --> 00:12:01.900
the assumptions that politicians know better than scientists that panicked

218
00:12:02.620 --> 00:12:02.710
coverups.

219
00:12:02.710 --> 00:12:06.430
And a lot of ways you could say the BSE scandal was really the West's version of

220
00:12:06.431 --> 00:12:08.740
something like these fed locks, anthrax leaks,

221
00:12:08.890 --> 00:12:12.670
the accidental 1979 release of anthrax spores in Russia that killed a hundred

222
00:12:12.671 --> 00:12:14.200
civilians. In both cases,

223
00:12:14.201 --> 00:12:16.780
the government pretended nothing was wrong in both cases,

224
00:12:16.960 --> 00:12:18.940
nobody ever faced any kind of prosecution.

225
00:12:19.060 --> 00:12:23.740
But while these fed loves disaster would kill a hundred BSE would kill many

226
00:12:23.741 --> 00:12:25.150
more. By the end of the year,

227
00:12:25.151 --> 00:12:28.690
the John Gummer propaganda machine was in overdrive and one uncomfortable

228
00:12:28.691 --> 00:12:31.330
instance. He was photographed feeding his four year old daughter,

229
00:12:31.720 --> 00:12:35.920
a beef burger bumps by now the dangers of BRC were becoming all too apparent

230
00:12:35.950 --> 00:12:37.060
that May,

231
00:12:37.060 --> 00:12:40.900
1990 accounts in Bristol had died from BSC after being fed infected beef.

232
00:12:40.930 --> 00:12:43.990
By the time the year ended 18 more cats were dead from the disease.

233
00:12:44.020 --> 00:12:45.310
This wasn't another scrape.

234
00:12:45.340 --> 00:12:49.150
There was now clear evidence that BSE was not just jumping the species barrier,

235
00:12:49.330 --> 00:12:51.790
but leaping over it with gay abandon,

236
00:12:52.360 --> 00:12:56.020
14 other species had now been infected from household pets to animals in zoos.

237
00:12:56.260 --> 00:13:00.550
Everything that ate beef seems to be coming down with this awful and fatal

238
00:13:00.551 --> 00:13:03.910
illness with one major exception as 1991,

239
00:13:04.330 --> 00:13:05.680
Dawn's bringing with it a new prime minister,

240
00:13:05.681 --> 00:13:10.150
not a single case of BSE in humans had yet been recorded, but sadly,

241
00:13:10.151 --> 00:13:11.080
that was bounced to chain.

242
00:13:17.850 --> 00:13:17.880
<v 1>[Inaudible].</v>

243
00:13:17.880 --> 00:13:19.800
<v 0>The start of the crisis. In 1989,</v>

244
00:13:19.801 --> 00:13:23.460
the British government had ordered the extermination of all effected cattle.

245
00:13:23.520 --> 00:13:27.090
However, they offered farmers only 50% compensation for each cow killed.

246
00:13:27.330 --> 00:13:27.781
And in fact,

247
00:13:27.781 --> 00:13:32.580
putting a heavy financial incentive in place for ignoring or misdiagnosing early

248
00:13:32.581 --> 00:13:34.530
signs of BSE. On top of that,

249
00:13:34.570 --> 00:13:38.490
the mechanically recovered meats ban of 1999 had a woeful lack of oversight.

250
00:13:38.520 --> 00:13:40.290
As late as November,

251
00:13:40.290 --> 00:13:44.160
1995 infected spinal column would still be making its way into the human food

252
00:13:44.161 --> 00:13:44.760
supply.

253
00:13:44.760 --> 00:13:49.560
All of which may go some way to explaining what would happen next in May, 1995,

254
00:13:50.400 --> 00:13:52.590
BSE as a national crisis seemed to be on the wane.

255
00:13:52.740 --> 00:13:55.290
The peak days of 1992 to 1993,

256
00:13:55.291 --> 00:13:59.340
when three cattle in every 1000 were infected, had already passed.

257
00:13:59.520 --> 00:14:02.760
Then disaster struck the first symptoms. 19 year old,

258
00:14:02.761 --> 00:14:06.060
Steve Churchill showed hallucinations and trouble walking.

259
00:14:06.330 --> 00:14:09.330
Initially doctors diagnosed him with a psychiatric disorder,

260
00:14:09.360 --> 00:14:12.090
but as time went on and his condition deteriorated,

261
00:14:12.330 --> 00:14:15.780
it became clear that there was something badly wrong at 9:00 AM.

262
00:14:15.870 --> 00:14:19.950
On may the 21st, 1995, Steve Churchill died in the aftermath.

263
00:14:19.951 --> 00:14:24.000
His brain was sent to Edinburgh for analysis that they discovered the telltale

264
00:14:24.030 --> 00:14:28.860
tiny sponge-like holes of creeps, felled Yacob disease in and of itself.

265
00:14:28.950 --> 00:14:31.440
This was not impossible in the mid nineties as now,

266
00:14:31.470 --> 00:14:34.500
natural CJD killed around 60 Britains a year,

267
00:14:34.680 --> 00:14:38.820
but rarely did it attack someone so young by June scientists working on the poor

268
00:14:38.850 --> 00:14:42.450
dead boy's brain were terrified. They might have a new disease on their hands.

269
00:14:42.510 --> 00:14:45.150
That predictions would turn out to be painfully, right?

270
00:14:45.420 --> 00:14:48.630
That October two teenagers came down with this new form of CJD.

271
00:14:49.140 --> 00:14:51.770
Then a casual farmer come March, 1998.

272
00:14:51.780 --> 00:14:56.150
Young people had all died of CJD in a matter of months and in a statistical

273
00:14:56.151 --> 00:14:58.190
impossibility on the eighth of the month,

274
00:14:58.220 --> 00:15:00.770
the government called a meeting with the nation's top scientists.

275
00:15:00.830 --> 00:15:04.580
It was there that a horrifying announcement was made just by all the years of

276
00:15:04.581 --> 00:15:09.050
assurances. Despite John governor's massive propaganda drive BSC, uh,

277
00:15:09.080 --> 00:15:12.500
jumped the species barrier, mad cow disease was now killing humans,

278
00:15:12.560 --> 00:15:16.730
eating away at their brains. There was no way to stop the process or of assets.

279
00:15:16.970 --> 00:15:19.280
And no one knew how many people are infected.

280
00:15:19.580 --> 00:15:21.620
The next few days played out like a horror movie.

281
00:15:21.800 --> 00:15:25.550
As the human form of BSE was declared variant crude so-called Yacob disease,

282
00:15:25.700 --> 00:15:29.750
or the CJD panics politicians asked how many people it might kill.

283
00:15:29.960 --> 00:15:33.860
The answer was anything from a few hundred to over half a million,

284
00:15:34.190 --> 00:15:36.380
half a million Britons killed by a disease.

285
00:15:36.381 --> 00:15:39.380
There was entirely manmade disease that wouldn't exist.

286
00:15:39.560 --> 00:15:43.790
If the government hadn't stifled scientists and made faulty assumptions, yet,

287
00:15:43.820 --> 00:15:48.170
even as those in white, all face down the barrel of a devastating pandemic,

288
00:15:48.380 --> 00:15:50.240
no one bothered to warn the public.

289
00:15:50.300 --> 00:15:54.350
No one told people about the dangers of eating beef for another 12 days.

290
00:15:54.530 --> 00:15:57.080
Finally, on the morning of March the 20th, 1996,

291
00:15:57.081 --> 00:16:00.680
the tabloid the daily mirror broke the story in bold text.

292
00:16:01.610 --> 00:16:04.100
BSC can kill humans just hours later.

293
00:16:04.130 --> 00:16:07.460
The health secretary stood up before parliament and declared a new deadly brain

294
00:16:07.461 --> 00:16:12.050
disease caused by infected beef had been discovered by now the attended cases in

295
00:16:12.051 --> 00:16:17.000
humans, what happens next? No one knew they could. However, agree on one thing,

296
00:16:17.120 --> 00:16:19.580
it was going to be the scandal of the decade.

297
00:16:26.650 --> 00:16:29.830
The mouth of the government's announcement Britain's beef industry collapsed

298
00:16:29.860 --> 00:16:33.670
billions of pounds were wiped out alongside millions of cattle in an effort to

299
00:16:33.671 --> 00:16:37.180
control the disease. 4.4 million cows were slotted and burned.

300
00:16:37.300 --> 00:16:39.490
Incinerators glows on farms around the clock.

301
00:16:39.520 --> 00:16:43.660
Dead cattle piled up in mountains of corpses out to 60 farms,

302
00:16:43.661 --> 00:16:45.250
went bankrupt internationally.

303
00:16:45.251 --> 00:16:47.980
The EU immediately banned all beef and bolts from Britain.

304
00:16:48.580 --> 00:16:52.240
It was already too late. Over the following years, 26 French people would die.

305
00:16:52.420 --> 00:16:56.680
A V C J D alongside five Spaniards, four Irish, three Dutch, two Italians,

306
00:16:56.920 --> 00:16:58.150
and two Portuguese.

307
00:16:58.600 --> 00:17:03.130
But it was in Britain that the human cost would be at its highest. By 1998,

308
00:17:03.160 --> 00:17:06.160
there were 18 cases a year. All of them fatal. Well,

309
00:17:06.161 --> 00:17:09.550
that's a relatively small number, mosques, awful suffering,

310
00:17:09.730 --> 00:17:14.050
almost all of the victims of V C J D one under 30. Most were teenagers.

311
00:17:14.140 --> 00:17:16.570
As the disease took hold, they lost their motor functions.

312
00:17:16.570 --> 00:17:20.110
The ability to speak became badly disabled, unable to do anything.

313
00:17:20.111 --> 00:17:24.310
But when in pain, as their families looked on helpless to stop their agony,

314
00:17:24.520 --> 00:17:26.530
it was a nasty, painful way to die.

315
00:17:26.680 --> 00:17:30.490
One made worse by different approaches across the nation. In some areas,

316
00:17:30.491 --> 00:17:32.650
patients were allowed to be with their families in others.

317
00:17:32.651 --> 00:17:36.580
They were locked in isolation for the last months of their lives left to die

318
00:17:36.581 --> 00:17:39.070
alone in agony, by local authorities,

319
00:17:39.160 --> 00:17:41.830
scared they might pass their sickness on that same year,

320
00:17:41.831 --> 00:17:46.150
the new government set up a research body to basically try and estimate how

321
00:17:46.180 --> 00:17:47.050
screwed they were.

322
00:17:47.500 --> 00:17:52.050
The answer utterly VC JD was found to not just in fact,

323
00:17:52.080 --> 00:17:54.900
the brain ends the spine. It infected the entire body,

324
00:17:54.901 --> 00:17:57.900
even getting into the blood. And some of those who had already died,

325
00:17:57.901 --> 00:18:02.460
a VCG D were known blood donors over 6,000 people in Britain were given BSE

326
00:18:02.461 --> 00:18:03.210
infected blood.

327
00:18:03.210 --> 00:18:06.360
As the government spends a hundred million pounds to filter the disease out of

328
00:18:06.361 --> 00:18:08.820
the blood bank. Most countries on earth, BAMS,

329
00:18:08.821 --> 00:18:13.050
British blood donations bands that still remain in effect as the new millennium

330
00:18:13.500 --> 00:18:13.680
dawns.

331
00:18:13.680 --> 00:18:17.220
It looks like the crisis would never end the year two thousands or a jump in

332
00:18:17.221 --> 00:18:21.480
annual deaths to 28. The next year BSC appeared in Japanese cattle.

333
00:18:21.510 --> 00:18:24.870
The first country outside Britain to be sucked into the crisis.

334
00:18:25.050 --> 00:18:28.140
Two years after that in 2003 Canadian cattle were infected,

335
00:18:28.500 --> 00:18:32.250
at least one enter the human food chain leading to a total shutdown of Canadian

336
00:18:32.251 --> 00:18:37.170
exports. That's wiped $11 million off the economy every single day.

337
00:18:37.230 --> 00:18:41.250
And then just as it looked as if the crisis had hit a tipping point, it stopped.

338
00:18:41.490 --> 00:18:45.330
Although 2005 saw the first Japanese human death from VC J D.

339
00:18:45.660 --> 00:18:47.670
It wouldn't be followed by another. In the UK.

340
00:18:47.671 --> 00:18:50.520
The cases were on a downward trends by 2007.

341
00:18:50.610 --> 00:18:52.710
It dropped to only five cases per annum,

342
00:18:53.040 --> 00:18:55.890
although over 160 persons that died so far,

343
00:18:55.950 --> 00:19:00.300
it seems like the threats of death from mad cow disease had it lost faded.

344
00:19:07.790 --> 00:19:08.090
<v 2>[Inaudible].</v>

345
00:19:08.090 --> 00:19:09.260
<v 0>In the mid 1950s,</v>

346
00:19:09.290 --> 00:19:13.310
scientists made a gruesome discovery in the Highlands of new Guinea and isolated

347
00:19:13.311 --> 00:19:17.450
tribe was being filled by something similar to crude smell to Yacob disease,

348
00:19:17.510 --> 00:19:21.680
children, adults, the elderly were also coming first, losing their coordination,

349
00:19:21.800 --> 00:19:25.370
then feeling their mind, slip away as the blade consumed them.

350
00:19:25.400 --> 00:19:27.140
Given the rarity of CGD,

351
00:19:27.200 --> 00:19:30.020
it would have been remarkable if two members of the tribe had died of it,

352
00:19:30.410 --> 00:19:33.560
but dozens, clearly something was going on.

353
00:19:33.830 --> 00:19:37.520
So scientists investigated and uncovered a shocking story.

354
00:19:37.670 --> 00:19:41.390
The tribe were cannibals whose death rituals involve eating the bodies of their

355
00:19:41.391 --> 00:19:45.530
loved ones at some points that consumed the brain of someone with CJD,

356
00:19:45.710 --> 00:19:50.540
allowing it to infect more tribe members who in turn infected more tribe members

357
00:19:50.690 --> 00:19:52.970
when the diet of the disease. So on,

358
00:19:53.030 --> 00:19:56.630
it was eerily similar to BSE in Britain so much so that when the mad counters

359
00:19:56.631 --> 00:20:00.590
these get kicked off in the 1990s, London sent some people to investigate.

360
00:20:00.860 --> 00:20:04.310
They would not return with reassuring news, just like with the CJD,

361
00:20:04.311 --> 00:20:08.900
the new Guinea tribe that exhibited an onset of symptoms some five years after

362
00:20:08.901 --> 00:20:13.460
eating infected meat. But there hadn't just been a single spate of deaths.

363
00:20:13.640 --> 00:20:17.000
There had been at least two distinct waves. In some cases,

364
00:20:17.001 --> 00:20:20.450
the incubation period, it lasted up to 50 years,

365
00:20:20.510 --> 00:20:22.370
the proteins that CGD deforms.

366
00:20:22.371 --> 00:20:26.360
Remember the ones that turn into toxic chains that eat through your brain.

367
00:20:26.480 --> 00:20:31.430
They always carry one of two variants and or V since they're

368
00:20:31.431 --> 00:20:34.040
inherited from our parents, everyone on earth has either,

369
00:20:34.370 --> 00:20:39.290
mm genes in these proteins or MV or VV all the new Guinea tribe members to

370
00:20:39.291 --> 00:20:43.760
die in. The first wave had the M M genotype. Now nearly half a century later,

371
00:20:43.761 --> 00:20:48.520
all those to die from V C J D in Britain and abroad had also been, mm, types.

372
00:20:48.580 --> 00:20:53.140
This left a single horrifying likelihood BSC was going to

373
00:20:53.141 --> 00:20:56.620
return. And it started in late 2014,

374
00:20:56.800 --> 00:20:59.860
a 36 year old British man began showing signs of CJD.

375
00:20:59.950 --> 00:21:02.170
When he died in February, 2016,

376
00:21:02.200 --> 00:21:05.740
scientists checked his brain and discovered had been infected with the human

377
00:21:05.741 --> 00:21:10.180
form of BSE, likely from eating infected meat as a child. But here's the kicker.

378
00:21:10.300 --> 00:21:12.460
When scientists finally checked his genotype,

379
00:21:12.670 --> 00:21:16.540
they found he didn't hold an mm combination, but MV,

380
00:21:16.660 --> 00:21:19.600
there had been a suspected case before in 2009,

381
00:21:19.810 --> 00:21:22.300
but this was the first confirmed one. Finally,

382
00:21:22.330 --> 00:21:26.080
the dormant disease was activating in a whole new slew of people.

383
00:21:26.170 --> 00:21:30.850
And with that cliffhanger, our story has to end since 2016,

384
00:21:30.851 --> 00:21:35.470
there have been no more confirmed deaths of MV gene holders due to the CJD.

385
00:21:35.740 --> 00:21:39.760
It may be that this manmade plague is over that there will be no more deaths and

386
00:21:39.910 --> 00:21:44.890
mad cow disease will soon be seen as a Relic of the 1990s on par with the spice

387
00:21:44.891 --> 00:21:47.980
girls and maybe got cheese. But that seems unlikely.

388
00:21:48.100 --> 00:21:51.970
Everything we know about VCG D suggests there's a second wave right around the

389
00:21:51.971 --> 00:21:52.804
corner, uh,

390
00:21:53.110 --> 00:21:56.860
points in the near future when it will cut a swath through Britain's population.

391
00:21:56.861 --> 00:22:01.180
Again, felling those with the VMG genotype in the early 2000 and tens,

392
00:22:01.210 --> 00:22:05.830
the UK government reported that as many as one in 2000 Britains may be silent

393
00:22:05.831 --> 00:22:10.060
carriers, a VCG D with dozens, more scattered across the globe.

394
00:22:10.300 --> 00:22:12.160
When the second wave finally hits,

395
00:22:12.370 --> 00:22:15.400
it could kill any number of them to date 178.

396
00:22:15.401 --> 00:22:20.110
People in the UK have died of human variant BSC with another 52 dads and other

397
00:22:20.111 --> 00:22:23.110
countries in a world shaken by COVID-19.

398
00:22:23.170 --> 00:22:27.220
It's tempting to hear such statistics and think that's not much,

399
00:22:27.520 --> 00:22:31.120
but make no mistake. VC J D isn't a regular disease.

400
00:22:31.330 --> 00:22:34.210
It's a man-made disaster and a government coverup,

401
00:22:34.240 --> 00:22:37.600
one more comparable to Soviet bio weapons leak,

402
00:22:37.601 --> 00:22:42.490
or the Tuskegee syphilis experiments than to a natural phenomenon faced with

403
00:22:42.491 --> 00:22:44.830
knowledge that could have saved lives if published,

404
00:22:44.831 --> 00:22:46.810
but resulted in an economic hit.

405
00:22:46.990 --> 00:22:51.460
The British government chose to protect the economy because of that choice.

406
00:22:51.490 --> 00:22:55.450
Over 230 people died with hundreds, more possibly to come.

407
00:22:55.540 --> 00:22:58.150
Usually when we think of these sorts of coverups,

408
00:22:58.151 --> 00:23:02.710
we think of incompetent dictatorships. So nations in the distant past,

409
00:23:02.920 --> 00:23:07.450
but BSE a disease caused by human greed shows this isn't always the case.

410
00:23:07.660 --> 00:23:12.520
You can live in a rich Western functioning democracy and still be

411
00:23:12.521 --> 00:23:14.530
killed by government malfeasance.

412
00:23:14.830 --> 00:23:18.790
The story of this horrific plague isn't over there may be another volume,

413
00:23:18.920 --> 00:23:20.110
still waiting to be written.

414
00:23:20.440 --> 00:23:24.220
One that catalogs yet more deaths yet more appalling,

415
00:23:24.610 --> 00:23:28.450
needless suffering. All we can do is just wait and see.

416
00:23:29.470 --> 00:23:31.150
