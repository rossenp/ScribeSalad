5
00:00:18.740 --> 00:00:20.120
At the Dawn of the 20th century.

6
00:00:20.790 --> 00:00:23.830
One young doctor in Vienna developed a theory that would change our

7
00:00:23.831 --> 00:00:27.950
understanding of the human minds forever using cutting edge techniques.

8
00:00:27.951 --> 00:00:32.110
That doctor delved further into the psyche than anyone had before he created

9
00:00:32.200 --> 00:00:36.030
names like the it and super ego that are still in use today,

10
00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:40.030
he cuts along patterns of thinking like transference in the EDUs complex that

11
00:00:40.031 --> 00:00:42.260
still influence over a century later.

12
00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:47.460
Even now his name is still instantly recognizable and it is of course,

13
00:00:48.140 --> 00:00:50.260
SIG Freud born in the mid 19th century.

14
00:00:50.580 --> 00:00:54.340
And what was then the Austrian em empire Freud's life was that a consummate

15
00:00:54.860 --> 00:00:55.320
outsider.

16
00:00:55.320 --> 00:00:57.780
<v 4>He was an ethnic Jew in a city full of Catholics,</v>

17
00:00:57.980 --> 00:01:01.930
an atheist in a community of practicing Jews in a time of the intense

18
00:01:01.931 --> 00:01:06.410
conservatism. He preached that everyone was bisexual and shocked society.

19
00:01:06.411 --> 00:01:10.570
When he suggested that erotic desire was rooted in childhood trauma.

20
00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:12.050
The father of psychoanalysis,

21
00:01:12.430 --> 00:01:16.170
the inspiration for surrealism and a Maverick who courted controversy,

22
00:01:16.660 --> 00:01:21.010
Freud usher in our modern notion of the minds. Yet he died in exile,

23
00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:25.280
persecuted and loathed by the city that had dedicated his life to.

24
00:01:31.620 --> 00:01:35.240
<v 0>If you were to leave Vienna ands walk, do north for 150 miles,</v>

25
00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:38.480
you would eventually come to a little town called preborn a small,

26
00:01:38.760 --> 00:01:39.470
somewhat pretty place.

27
00:01:39.470 --> 00:01:44.230
Preborn is utterly unremarkable among Czech towns in almost every respect

28
00:01:44.260 --> 00:01:48.990
with one exception. It was here on may the sixth, 1856.

29
00:01:48.991 --> 00:01:51.270
That Sigman Freud was born at that time.

30
00:01:51.790 --> 00:01:55.750
Pre-born was heavily Catholic town in the Austrian empire with the German name

31
00:01:55.950 --> 00:01:59.710
of Fryberg and it had a Jewish community so tiny that you could count its

32
00:01:59.711 --> 00:02:01.390
members on just one hand,

33
00:02:01.810 --> 00:02:06.620
but small did persecuted Freud managed to be born at a fortuitous time for Jews

34
00:02:06.621 --> 00:02:10.020
in the Austrian empire. Just a few years before the new emperor, France,

35
00:02:10.340 --> 00:02:13.340
Joseph SIIT decreed that the law would stop persecuting.

36
00:02:13.341 --> 00:02:17.620
Other religions no longer would the Empire's Jewish inhabitants be subject to

37
00:02:17.621 --> 00:02:18.780
ghettos and restrictions.

38
00:02:18.810 --> 00:02:23.220
They would be free even to live unrestricted in the Imperial capital of Vienna.

39
00:02:23.500 --> 00:02:26.290
The not that the Freud's immediately took advantage of this, right?

40
00:02:26.390 --> 00:02:30.450
The first few years of Freud's life were passed in the pleasant dullness of pre

41
00:02:30.690 --> 00:02:35.130
Bo dullness that nonetheless masked an eccentric upbringing Freud's father Jacob

42
00:02:35.310 --> 00:02:39.210
was by now on his second marriage and his mother, Emily was 20 years.

43
00:02:39.400 --> 00:02:43.410
Jacob's ju app. One consequence of this was that by the time Freud was born,

44
00:02:43.510 --> 00:02:45.840
he already had a nephew who was a year older than him.

45
00:02:45.910 --> 00:02:49.680
John was Freud's first great friendship as toddlers. The two were inseparable,

46
00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:51.400
but as Freud later remark,

47
00:02:51.920 --> 00:02:54.920
they were also rivals that model of an intimate male friendship.

48
00:02:54.921 --> 00:02:59.000
<v 4>That was also overshadowed by great rivalry would be one that repeated itself</v>

49
00:02:59.080 --> 00:03:00.160
throughout Freud's life.

50
00:03:00.300 --> 00:03:05.000
In 1859 Freud's older half brother took John and moved away to Manchester in

51
00:03:05.001 --> 00:03:05.500
England.

52
00:03:05.500 --> 00:03:10.120
At first Freud tried to fill the hole of John's fr ship by becoming unhealthily

53
00:03:10.121 --> 00:03:12.960
close to his mother that while Emily doted on her boy,

54
00:03:13.020 --> 00:03:14.760
she was also now heavily pregnant.

55
00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:16.800
<v 0>Needless to say that subsequent,</v>

56
00:03:17.200 --> 00:03:21.150
glad of four girls and two boy is vying for Emily's attention would make young

57
00:03:21.240 --> 00:03:25.550
Freud crazy jealous that same year, 1859 Jacob's business collapsed.

58
00:03:25.551 --> 00:03:28.670
And he moved the family to Lipsig, but things were no better.

59
00:03:28.860 --> 00:03:30.270
INAX andan in 1860,

60
00:03:30.330 --> 00:03:34.670
the Freud's joins the mass influx of Jews from across the Austrian embar,

61
00:03:34.671 --> 00:03:38.670
moving into vie. The Austria capital of a deeply conservative monarchy vie.

62
00:03:39.180 --> 00:03:41.420
1860 was a European power center,

63
00:03:41.560 --> 00:03:44.220
but one with a bit of a dull reputation,

64
00:03:44.240 --> 00:03:48.540
it was the Dowdy sister of elegance Paris and industrious London.

65
00:03:48.760 --> 00:03:52.740
Yet it was also a capital on the cusp of change as Jewish intellectuals,

66
00:03:52.741 --> 00:03:56.100
Hungarian, a Toras and German artists all converged on the city.

67
00:03:56.400 --> 00:03:58.900
The seeds were planted for Vienna's transformation.

68
00:03:59.590 --> 00:04:02.970
The key figures in that transformation. Well, that would be Sigman Freud.

69
00:04:03.110 --> 00:04:06.090
The family's early years in Vienna. They are much to remark upon.

70
00:04:06.090 --> 00:04:10.050
They're settled into Leo, Paul start, and Jacob presumably got a decent job.

71
00:04:10.190 --> 00:04:12.490
We can infer this because in 80 65,

72
00:04:12.510 --> 00:04:16.370
he was able to pay for nine year old Freud to attend an excellent gymnasium.

73
00:04:16.930 --> 00:04:17.750
And no, no,

74
00:04:17.750 --> 00:04:21.480
not that sort of gymnasium gymnasium is this central European term for a

75
00:04:21.481 --> 00:04:24.320
specialist school. During his years of this OUS,

76
00:04:24.350 --> 00:04:28.560
gymnasium Freud excelled at academic subjects developed a voracious appetite for

77
00:04:28.561 --> 00:04:33.240
books and had yet another of his trademark intimate Fren ships this time with a

78
00:04:33.260 --> 00:04:34.160
lat named Edward,

79
00:04:34.800 --> 00:04:38.680
yet it wasn't until his last year there that Freud made a casual decision that

80
00:04:38.681 --> 00:04:39.640
would change his life.

81
00:04:39.920 --> 00:04:43.990
<v 4>A public reading know one of G his nature essays was being staged in the young</v>

82
00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:45.510
Freud. He went along on a whim.

83
00:04:45.770 --> 00:04:49.550
It was while listening to this essay that Freud had a flash of inspiration.

84
00:04:49.810 --> 00:04:53.750
He now knew what he wanted to do with his life. He was going to study medicine.

85
00:05:00.090 --> 00:05:05.020
<v 0>The next decade cast in a blur in 1873 Freud enrolled at the university of</v>

86
00:05:05.140 --> 00:05:06.260
Vienna as a medical students,

87
00:05:06.261 --> 00:05:10.340
where he gained a solid reputation as a brain atomist it was while at university

88
00:05:10.341 --> 00:05:12.020
that he was introduced to the older Dr.

89
00:05:12.380 --> 00:05:15.940
Joseph Broyer a guy who was going to become really important to our story really

90
00:05:16.010 --> 00:05:17.980
soon, two years later in 1875,

91
00:05:18.070 --> 00:05:21.770
Freud traveled to England for the first time meeting up with his old fr John on,

92
00:05:21.910 --> 00:05:23.770
he returns to Vienna, obsessed with Britain,

93
00:05:23.840 --> 00:05:27.370
despite as he put it all the fog and rain, drunkenness,

94
00:05:27.430 --> 00:05:31.490
and conservatism by 1881, Freud was a qualified medical practitioner.

95
00:05:32.210 --> 00:05:34.210
Burley was the ink dry on his degree that had met him,

96
00:05:34.211 --> 00:05:37.290
fallen in love with his future wife, Martha BES. So,

97
00:05:37.330 --> 00:05:41.290
I mean was a fairly busy decade. BES and Freud were soon engaged,

98
00:05:41.430 --> 00:05:42.640
but there was a bit of a problem.

99
00:05:42.820 --> 00:05:45.240
Martha benets came from a highly respected family.

100
00:05:45.460 --> 00:05:48.760
Her grandfather had been the chief rabbi of Hamburg and her parents.

101
00:05:48.830 --> 00:05:51.960
They were used to the finer things. So in this semi impoverished,

102
00:05:52.020 --> 00:05:54.560
one of the doctor came and asked for their daughter's hand in marriage.

103
00:05:54.830 --> 00:05:56.400
They were all like, no, dude,

104
00:05:56.550 --> 00:06:00.080
come back when he got a decent job and you weren't dressed like a hobo. Okay.

105
00:06:00.340 --> 00:06:02.680
And so Freud found himself in 1982,

106
00:06:02.681 --> 00:06:07.120
suddenly in desperate need of a steady income for a Vietnamese medical students.

107
00:06:07.121 --> 00:06:07.740
At that time,

108
00:06:07.740 --> 00:06:12.200
the best way to get ahead was to do something grounds break and get noticed.

109
00:06:12.260 --> 00:06:15.280
And then you could use that fame to set up a practice.

110
00:06:15.410 --> 00:06:17.950
While Freud already had reputation as a brain expert,

111
00:06:17.951 --> 00:06:21.030
he had nothing on his CV that was guaranteed to make his name.

112
00:06:21.210 --> 00:06:25.030
So Freud decided to roll everything on a gamble that couldn't fail.

113
00:06:25.210 --> 00:06:27.990
He was going to introduce Vienna to cocaine.

114
00:06:34.190 --> 00:06:37.300
Now I promised we haven't got confused and accidentally started reading the

115
00:06:37.301 --> 00:06:39.100
Pablo Escobar script on this one.

116
00:06:39.110 --> 00:06:43.420
Freud was actually really certain that a breakthrough with cocaine was where his

117
00:06:43.421 --> 00:06:48.060
future fame and money to marry Martha Lei in April of 1884.

118
00:06:48.061 --> 00:06:51.780
He bought a huge quantity of it and began experimenting with it as a cure for

119
00:06:51.781 --> 00:06:55.700
depression, for indigestion, for alcoholism, you know, anything that might work.

120
00:06:55.701 --> 00:06:59.050
Unfortunately he missed the one age breakthrough that cocaine could have

121
00:06:59.051 --> 00:07:01.210
afforded him. It was Freud's friend, Carl Coller,

122
00:07:01.211 --> 00:07:04.250
who discovered that it could be used to numb people's eyes prior to surgery.

123
00:07:04.510 --> 00:07:07.410
By the time that year had passed. Freud's great. Faray into cocaine,

124
00:07:07.411 --> 00:07:10.930
had gotten him nothing but missed opportunities and an expensive addiction.

125
00:07:11.270 --> 00:07:11.971
So well,

126
00:07:11.971 --> 00:07:16.050
he decided to change tack then July Freud left Vienna and traveled to Paris to

127
00:07:16.051 --> 00:07:17.770
study under the great neurologist Jean,

128
00:07:18.160 --> 00:07:22.080
a Chaco for most of the 19th century nervous disorders had been approached from

129
00:07:22.120 --> 00:07:25.440
a biological perspective, like fixing a leaky ship.

130
00:07:25.580 --> 00:07:28.040
If you could discover where the fault was in patch,

131
00:07:28.600 --> 00:07:31.520
you'd have a halt person again, where others would talk about surgery.

132
00:07:32.360 --> 00:07:36.160
Chaco was interested in hypnosis where doctors in Vienna might whisper about

133
00:07:36.290 --> 00:07:37.123
brain structure.

134
00:07:37.760 --> 00:07:42.750
Chaco was da with healing patients using only the power of words for Freud

135
00:07:42.751 --> 00:07:47.470
witnessing Chacos methods was more minds blowing than a nose full of uncle

136
00:07:47.710 --> 00:07:51.230
Escobar's marching powder Freud returned to Vienna in 1886.

137
00:07:51.231 --> 00:07:54.390
Certain Chacos methods would give him an edge in his competitive field.

138
00:07:54.570 --> 00:07:56.270
At first it looked like another fail.

139
00:07:56.380 --> 00:08:00.820
Freud's contemporaries basically accused him of falling for a load of French

140
00:08:01.260 --> 00:08:03.260
melt, but Freud, he was determined.

141
00:08:03.320 --> 00:08:06.980
He sat up his own practice consulting on nervous diseases using hypnosis.

142
00:08:07.320 --> 00:08:10.820
And soon he had a regular enough income to be able to afford marriage on

143
00:08:10.980 --> 00:08:13.020
September the 13th, 1886 Sigman Freud,

144
00:08:13.021 --> 00:08:15.620
Martha BES were wet over the next 80 years.

145
00:08:15.720 --> 00:08:18.660
The Bunn would produce six children for Freud.

146
00:08:18.661 --> 00:08:22.250
Marrying Martha must have felt like the affirmation that he had been waiting for

147
00:08:22.610 --> 00:08:22.611
here.

148
00:08:22.611 --> 00:08:27.330
He was after all those false starts owner of a successful practice and married

149
00:08:27.350 --> 00:08:31.330
to the woman of his dreams, but Freud wasn't content to just stop. Now,

150
00:08:31.850 --> 00:08:35.930
he'd gotten a taste for grandiose ideas and for eccentric innovations.

151
00:08:36.350 --> 00:08:39.250
His next one. Well, it would change medicine forever.

152
00:08:45.430 --> 00:08:48.000
Come. The mid 1890s Freud was restless.

153
00:08:48.240 --> 00:08:51.440
He had been practicing his brand of psychotherapy for nearly 10 years now and

154
00:08:51.441 --> 00:08:53.360
was no longer getting the results he desired.

155
00:08:53.420 --> 00:08:57.240
It was while in this despondent mood that he got talking with his old teacher,

156
00:08:57.620 --> 00:09:00.600
Dr. Yo bro, during the conversation, bro,

157
00:09:00.601 --> 00:09:04.280
just so happens to mention some of his old cases. Way back in 1882,

158
00:09:04.600 --> 00:09:08.480
bro had treated a woman called Anna O Anna had been suffering from what used to

159
00:09:08.481 --> 00:09:09.520
be called hysteria.

160
00:09:09.600 --> 00:09:14.440
A casual term 19th century doctors used to mean anything from seizures to ANGs

161
00:09:14.910 --> 00:09:18.670
anxiety, to being too unladylike. But Anna had also been strong-willed.

162
00:09:18.850 --> 00:09:23.230
She shrugged off Brewer's attempts to use hypnosis and suggested they work for

163
00:09:23.231 --> 00:09:24.790
talking over the next few weeks.

164
00:09:24.791 --> 00:09:28.910
Patient and doctor developed something that they called the talking cure instead

165
00:09:28.911 --> 00:09:31.270
of Bri using hypnosis to implant suggestions,

166
00:09:31.610 --> 00:09:36.140
HYP just allowed Anna to unburden herself a kind a cathartic release.

167
00:09:36.360 --> 00:09:40.620
The idea that you could use talking to get it hidden trauma was the craziest

168
00:09:40.621 --> 00:09:45.180
thing that Freud had heard since his days with Chaco and well

169
00:09:45.290 --> 00:09:47.700
naturally he loved it in 1895.

170
00:09:47.701 --> 00:09:51.660
He helped brewer write a case study that they published together as studio Uber

171
00:09:51.940 --> 00:09:52.860
hysteria. However,

172
00:09:53.500 --> 00:09:57.610
brewer was uncomfortable with Freud's obsess with his case does by what he

173
00:09:57.611 --> 00:09:59.650
claims, bro, hadn't actually cured. Anna.

174
00:09:59.830 --> 00:10:03.890
She was still in decline and today had thought unlikely that Bruce's treatment

175
00:10:03.891 --> 00:10:05.730
was helpful. Still Freud persisted.

176
00:10:05.750 --> 00:10:08.570
He began introducing the talking method to his own practice.

177
00:10:08.750 --> 00:10:12.250
He invented the classic psychoanalyst set up that we know from the movies,

178
00:10:12.390 --> 00:10:12.691
you know,

179
00:10:12.691 --> 00:10:16.400
with the patients lying on a comfortable couch while the doctors had out of

180
00:10:16.640 --> 00:10:17.340
sight taking notes,

181
00:10:17.340 --> 00:10:22.000
pretty soon Freud was using free association to get his Bour patients to talk

182
00:10:22.001 --> 00:10:23.520
about their darkest desires.

183
00:10:23.700 --> 00:10:26.440
And he kept finding out that they were all obsessed with sex.

184
00:10:26.740 --> 00:10:30.640
So this is where we get to the first of many controversial parts of Freud's

185
00:10:30.641 --> 00:10:34.520
work. All of Freud's patients, they were female. And it's a frequent accusation.

186
00:10:34.521 --> 00:10:38.150
That Freud was simply pathologizing, ordinary female sexuality,

187
00:10:38.151 --> 00:10:42.070
whether or not that's true Freud soon came to believe that our hidden desires

188
00:10:42.071 --> 00:10:46.350
were at the root of many of our problems before long he'd coined a term for the

189
00:10:46.351 --> 00:10:49.630
process of treating these problems. And that was psychoanalysis.

190
00:10:50.130 --> 00:10:53.670
But if you're expecting to hear that this is the beginning of Freud's rides to

191
00:10:53.790 --> 00:10:57.500
becoming a household name. Well, you might have to think again for a Freud,

192
00:10:57.501 --> 00:11:01.100
the late 1890s were spent in the intellectual wilderness. Sure.

193
00:11:01.101 --> 00:11:04.060
Things very okay. Financially and his home life was going fine.

194
00:11:04.061 --> 00:11:06.420
Martha had just given birth to their youngest daughter,

195
00:11:06.560 --> 00:11:10.180
the future child therapist, and a Freud, but Freud's reputation.

196
00:11:10.320 --> 00:11:13.820
It was floundering his initial attempts to create a handbook for psychoanalysis.

197
00:11:13.970 --> 00:11:16.780
They collapsed among the Catholic establishments.

198
00:11:17.020 --> 00:11:21.730
There were R that Freud was wasting time with some Jewish science. Once again,

199
00:11:21.940 --> 00:11:26.050
Freud was in need of a breakthrough to put his name in the spotlight in 1897,

200
00:11:26.470 --> 00:11:29.330
he found it up until that point. Freud had listened.

201
00:11:29.350 --> 00:11:33.050
As many of his patients described what appeared to be sexual abuse in their

202
00:11:33.051 --> 00:11:37.730
childhoods before 1897 Freud had tended to believe them that year

203
00:11:38.220 --> 00:11:39.720
he changed tack Freud.

204
00:11:40.120 --> 00:11:44.480
EAN moment was deciding that the abuses patients reported wasn't actually real.

205
00:11:44.670 --> 00:11:49.120
Instead it was all fantasies brought on by repressing sexuality in their

206
00:11:49.121 --> 00:11:53.360
childhood. And here is where we get to yet another controversial segment.

207
00:11:53.640 --> 00:11:57.520
Nowadays it's acknowledged that children experience immature sexual feelings,

208
00:11:57.521 --> 00:12:00.440
usually in the form of embarrassing crushes or really,

209
00:12:00.580 --> 00:12:03.320
really wanting to hold Chloe's hands during recess.

210
00:12:03.620 --> 00:12:06.840
But we also acknowledge that some adults really do abuse children,

211
00:12:07.030 --> 00:12:10.640
even adults from respectable middle class families as far from certain,

212
00:12:10.780 --> 00:12:12.440
but some argue Freud unwiting.

213
00:12:12.710 --> 00:12:17.070
He helped cover up a culture of abuse in Vienna saw the breakthrough gave Freud

214
00:12:17.170 --> 00:12:20.070
the notoriety that he always craved. Now,

215
00:12:20.190 --> 00:12:24.430
we just had to convince the deeply conservative society he lived in to take his

216
00:12:24.431 --> 00:12:29.230
wild thoughts on sexuality seriously and well, how hard could that be?

217
00:12:29.820 --> 00:12:30.830
Well, we will see,

218
00:12:31.190 --> 00:12:34.420
but first I want to take a quick moment to tell you about today's sponsor,

219
00:12:34.421 --> 00:12:38.060
brilliant, who make this video possible. Brilliant. Believe that learning math,

220
00:12:38.061 --> 00:12:41.140
science and computer science doesn't have to be dull. And to that end,

221
00:12:41.141 --> 00:12:43.500
they've put together courses that are all about storytelling,

222
00:12:43.650 --> 00:12:46.140
interactive challenges and solving problems.

223
00:12:46.210 --> 00:12:48.380
It's this hands on approach to learning.

224
00:12:48.400 --> 00:12:52.060
That's really an excellent way to learn. And currently on their website,

225
00:12:52.061 --> 00:12:54.890
they've got over 50 inter active courses. And look,

226
00:12:54.891 --> 00:12:57.570
you're halfway through a video about a very famous person in science.

227
00:12:57.571 --> 00:13:01.130
So you're probably already the curious type and brilliant can be a great way to

228
00:13:01.131 --> 00:13:04.570
take that curiosity a step further and understand the world even more.

229
00:13:04.670 --> 00:13:06.890
For example, there's a course on scientific thinking,

230
00:13:06.891 --> 00:13:10.690
which allows you to get a solid foundation in physics while just doing a few

231
00:13:10.691 --> 00:13:12.810
puzzles. Like I said, it's a great way to learn.

232
00:13:12.870 --> 00:13:16.120
You'll get to understand physics of things like mirror reflections,

233
00:13:16.330 --> 00:13:17.041
laser attack,

234
00:13:17.041 --> 00:13:20.800
who doesn't love that and a whole lot more so effective learning is all about

235
00:13:20.801 --> 00:13:24.520
problem solving and brilliant help you learn and practice. Just that.

236
00:13:24.710 --> 00:13:27.160
It's a great compliment to videos like this side.

237
00:13:27.161 --> 00:13:28.400
It's all good to learn something here,

238
00:13:28.401 --> 00:13:30.720
but why not take it a step further with brilliant?

239
00:13:30.980 --> 00:13:32.640
So if you wanna support biographics,

240
00:13:32.641 --> 00:13:36.910
which would be fantastic and unlimited access to all of brilliance in depth,

241

243
00:13:45.350 --> 00:13:46.310
And let's go back to Freud.

244
00:13:52.850 --> 00:13:55.380
If the 1890s were Freud's Wilder years,

245
00:13:55.440 --> 00:13:59.060
the first decade of the 20th century was Freud marching in from the desert,

246
00:13:59.130 --> 00:14:03.660
kicking down the gates of Vienna and forcing the world to listen to his

247
00:14:03.830 --> 00:14:05.340
ideas. In 1900,

248
00:14:05.400 --> 00:14:09.060
the interpretation of dreams hit the bookshelves with all of the force of a bomb

249
00:14:09.061 --> 00:14:09.680
going off.

250
00:14:09.680 --> 00:14:13.900
The basic outline of Freud's thesis was linking dreams with repressed desire,

251
00:14:13.901 --> 00:14:18.530
often stemming from childhood, while also talking about fantasy and daydreams,

252
00:14:18.531 --> 00:14:21.490
reflecting unconscious once. If that sounds a little abstract,

253
00:14:21.560 --> 00:14:25.250
know that this book is where the idea of the EDUs complex comes from something

254
00:14:25.280 --> 00:14:27.650
that we still talk about over a century later,

255
00:14:27.950 --> 00:14:31.770
but the most consequential parts was Freud's insistence that his discoveries

256
00:14:31.790 --> 00:14:34.770
didn't just apply to his patients. They were universal.

257
00:14:34.960 --> 00:14:39.480
This great oath of dark was railing away in all of us.

258
00:14:39.780 --> 00:14:43.400
It was this insight that would ensure Freud's name went down in history,

259
00:14:43.401 --> 00:14:47.560
starting in 1902 Freud followed up the book with regular lectures at Vienna

260
00:14:47.610 --> 00:14:50.280
university. Although the number of attendees was small.

261
00:14:50.330 --> 00:14:54.560
There was a core and loyal group before along that group was meeting with Freud

262
00:14:54.561 --> 00:14:57.920
every Wednesday to discuss psychoanalysis by 1908,

263
00:14:57.921 --> 00:15:02.040
they would grow into the hugely influential Vienna psychoanalytic society.

264
00:15:02.340 --> 00:15:04.560
As these meetings began to spread Freud's ideas,

265
00:15:04.561 --> 00:15:08.800
the man himself was hard at work churning out book after book first came the

266
00:15:08.801 --> 00:15:12.470
pathology of everyday life, which introduced the world to Freudian slips,

267
00:15:12.471 --> 00:15:16.150
disappointingly, not a Lacey undergarment. You were to seduce your mother,

268
00:15:16.290 --> 00:15:19.230
but the act of accidentally saying something revealing.

269
00:15:19.340 --> 00:15:24.150
This was followed in 1905 by fragments of an analysis of a case of hysteria,

270
00:15:24.160 --> 00:15:26.830
which first diagnosed the phenomenon of transference.

271
00:15:27.130 --> 00:15:29.390
It was around this time that Freud's growing fame,

272
00:15:29.391 --> 00:15:34.020
brought him into contact with Carl Young to say young was important to Freud's.

273
00:15:34.021 --> 00:15:37.340
Life is like saying the civil war probably affected Abraham Lincoln's career,

274
00:15:37.510 --> 00:15:38.380
their collaboration.

275
00:15:38.560 --> 00:15:43.220
It was intense and tragic intense because their meetings which turn into nonstop

276
00:15:43.500 --> 00:15:46.180
13 hour debates and tragic because, well,

277
00:15:46.240 --> 00:15:49.620
you'll see a little bit later in Yung Freud's saw someone who could make

278
00:15:49.621 --> 00:15:53.370
psychoanalysis mainstream because young was 20 years younger,

279
00:15:53.430 --> 00:15:56.930
but also because he was a Gentile, he may have been an atheist all his life,

280
00:15:56.931 --> 00:16:00.810
but Freud was only too aware of how Europe saw even non observant Jews.

281
00:16:00.880 --> 00:16:04.810
This meant that his discoveries could be pigeonholed as mirror Jewish crackery

282
00:16:04.910 --> 00:16:05.670
for several years,

283
00:16:05.670 --> 00:16:09.330
the collaboration spurred both Freud and young to even greater Heights.

284
00:16:09.650 --> 00:16:13.320
Young was there when Freud held the first psycho a Congress in Salberg.

285
00:16:13.460 --> 00:16:17.320
He was there when Freud gave his only lecture series in America at Clark

286
00:16:17.330 --> 00:16:18.520
university, Massachusetts.

287
00:16:18.860 --> 00:16:22.320
And he was there defending Freud in the public eye whenever his ideas were

288
00:16:22.321 --> 00:16:23.600
ridiculed, but a last,

289
00:16:23.900 --> 00:16:28.320
it was not a last in 1913 resentments that had been building between the two

290
00:16:28.340 --> 00:16:30.320
men. They finally came exploding out.

291
00:16:30.321 --> 00:16:33.670
There are many theories about what caused their rift, but given today's subject,

292
00:16:33.850 --> 00:16:38.110
it seems only fitting to highlight one, particularly Freudian interpretation.

293
00:16:38.130 --> 00:16:41.510
We know that Freud occasionally fretted, that he had a gay side. Indeed.

294
00:16:41.610 --> 00:16:45.950
He claims that all humans were innately bisexual and that he may have harbored

295
00:16:45.951 --> 00:16:47.110
repressed feelings for young.

296
00:16:47.250 --> 00:16:51.190
We also know that young had unresolved anger issues relating to his father

297
00:16:51.230 --> 00:16:54.620
feelings. He often directed to Ward's father figures like Freud,

298
00:16:54.860 --> 00:16:59.060
whatever the truth, the break between the two men, it was permanence in 1913.

299
00:16:59.150 --> 00:17:00.260
Freud wrote the younger man,

300
00:17:00.300 --> 00:17:02.700
a letter telling him he never wanted to see him again.

301
00:17:03.220 --> 00:17:06.180
Young seems to have agreed, and he never tried to contact Freud. Again,

302
00:17:06.440 --> 00:17:10.380
it was the end of an intense period of creativity for Freud and the end of his

303
00:17:10.381 --> 00:17:12.500
dreams of grooming a success app.

304
00:17:12.780 --> 00:17:15.890
But that time period was also the end of something else too.

305
00:17:16.570 --> 00:17:19.770
Fraud didn't know it, but he was living through the last days of Europe.

306
00:17:26.110 --> 00:17:29.690
The first world war was like a wrecking ball crashing into the house of cards,

307
00:17:29.691 --> 00:17:33.210
marked history. In the short years, between 1914 and 1918,

308
00:17:33.230 --> 00:17:37.320
the horse swept away three whole empires, including Austria, Hungary come late.

309
00:17:37.520 --> 00:17:41.360
1918 Vienna had gone from being a seat of European power to the backwater

310
00:17:41.361 --> 00:17:45.320
capital of a small impoverished nation known simply as Austria for Freud.

311
00:17:45.380 --> 00:17:47.600
The war had been marked by the constant threat of tragedy,

312
00:17:47.790 --> 00:17:50.400
both personal and professional. On the personal side,

313
00:17:50.420 --> 00:17:53.720
all three of his sons had been drafted to serve in the O Hungarian army,

314
00:17:53.860 --> 00:17:56.840
making the death of at least one of them seem almost inevitable.

315
00:17:57.180 --> 00:17:58.160
On the professional side,

316
00:17:58.180 --> 00:18:01.320
the outbreak of war killed the international psychoanalysis movement.

317
00:18:01.330 --> 00:18:04.440
Stone debt for four long years, Freud was confined to Vienna,

318
00:18:04.550 --> 00:18:07.960
able to do nothing, but right think and dream of a better future.

319
00:18:08.100 --> 00:18:12.190
It was during this period that the lifelong cigar smoker first discovered a

320
00:18:12.191 --> 00:18:14.790
strange growth on his jaw. Yet Freud was lucky.

321
00:18:15.090 --> 00:18:17.510
All three of his sons came back alive from the front.

322
00:18:17.730 --> 00:18:21.430
And when the war ended in 1918 and the economy of Austria was battered by

323
00:18:21.431 --> 00:18:25.470
runaway inflation Freud was able to take British clans to provide his family

324
00:18:25.500 --> 00:18:28.630
with hard currency for the lifelong Anglophile Freud.

325
00:18:28.631 --> 00:18:30.020
This was a dream come true.

326
00:18:30.200 --> 00:18:33.860
His patients were the famous Bloomsbury set a collection of free thinking,

327
00:18:34.100 --> 00:18:34.933
right? As an artist,

328
00:18:35.090 --> 00:18:37.940
when they came to him for treatment Freud made it a condition that they

329
00:18:38.420 --> 00:18:39.420
translate his works into English.

330
00:18:39.640 --> 00:18:43.340
It was this agreement that would eventually make Freud a household name yet.

331
00:18:43.341 --> 00:18:48.020
It was also into this postwar period that tragedy finally struck in 1919,

332
00:18:48.140 --> 00:18:52.170
a virent new strain of flu. We, it swept the world known as Spanish flu.

333
00:18:52.190 --> 00:18:56.010
It remains one of the deadliest pandemics in history. In one short year,

334
00:18:56.270 --> 00:19:01.130
it killed up to 50 million people among that 50 million was Freud's daughter.

335
00:19:01.130 --> 00:19:04.890
Sophie. The death of Sophie came as a devastating blow to Freud.

336
00:19:04.990 --> 00:19:06.410
Barely had he recovered from this.

337
00:19:06.440 --> 00:19:09.370
When he himself was diagnosed with cancer of the draw,

338
00:19:09.590 --> 00:19:12.960
it was this start of a long decline from which Freud would never recover.

339
00:19:13.260 --> 00:19:17.160
But life goes on as the great war gave wage in the roaring twenties Freud

340
00:19:17.161 --> 00:19:19.880
continued to write publishing the ego and the IDs.

341
00:19:19.900 --> 00:19:23.840
The work that gave us times like super ego that are still used today.

342
00:19:24.060 --> 00:19:26.880
He also began to focus on his daughter and as development,

343
00:19:26.881 --> 00:19:30.870
taking her to psychiatric conferences and increasingly sending her in his place

344
00:19:30.900 --> 00:19:32.750
when the cancer left him too weak,

345
00:19:32.850 --> 00:19:36.430
it was around this time when Freud was at his lowest E that psychoanalysis

346
00:19:36.570 --> 00:19:38.590
really began to take off in Paris.

347
00:19:38.950 --> 00:19:42.790
These surrealists founded an entire art movement inspired by Freud's discoveries

348
00:19:42.930 --> 00:19:46.550
in Vienna Freud found himself suddenly treating the fabulously wealthy like

349
00:19:46.910 --> 00:19:50.150
Marie Bonna party, descendant of Napoleon. By the end of the twenties,

350
00:19:50.170 --> 00:19:53.820
you could even convince yourself that Freud's life was getting back on track the

351
00:19:53.940 --> 00:19:55.020
cancer killin.

352
00:19:55.021 --> 00:19:59.220
He was publishing books like civilization and its discontents and psychoanalysis

353
00:19:59.440 --> 00:20:01.500
was taking off in America. But sadly,

354
00:20:01.640 --> 00:20:06.220
we already know that this was just an illusion from a vantage point of the 21st

355
00:20:06.221 --> 00:20:09.420
century. We can already see the clouds gathering on the horizon.

356
00:20:09.760 --> 00:20:14.450
The storm that will be unleashed by a nationalist with a fanatical hatred for

357
00:20:14.560 --> 00:20:17.090
Jews, for the Jewish Freud, still living in Vienna.

358
00:20:17.280 --> 00:20:20.050
That storm would be destined to consume him

359
00:20:26.270 --> 00:20:27.810
On may the 10th, 1933,

360
00:20:27.850 --> 00:20:30.730
a large group of students gathered outside the state operate Berlin,

361
00:20:31.110 --> 00:20:33.960
but these students were aren't there to down kegs or party.

362
00:20:34.270 --> 00:20:37.600
They were there to burn books belly two months earlier,

363
00:20:37.740 --> 00:20:40.040
the German parliament had passed the enabling act,

364
00:20:40.041 --> 00:20:43.360
handing total power to add off Hitler. Now the Nazi student groups,

365
00:20:43.361 --> 00:20:47.640
they were showing their enthusiasm for the new regime by consigning 25,000

366
00:20:48.480 --> 00:20:51.920
Urman books to the flames among the books that were burned that day were the

367
00:20:51.921 --> 00:20:53.680
works of Sigman Freud in Vienna.

368
00:20:53.810 --> 00:20:56.840
Freud could only watch his neighboring Germany felt Nazi.

369
00:20:57.420 --> 00:21:00.920
His soul consolation may have been that Austria hadn't yet succumbed.

370
00:21:01.400 --> 00:21:04.240
Although fascists seizes control of the country in 1934,

371
00:21:04.241 --> 00:21:07.870
they stopped short of the outright EMM of the Nazis.

372
00:21:08.000 --> 00:21:10.870
Still the growing violence in Germany. It must have put everyone on edge.

373
00:21:10.871 --> 00:21:12.310
People must have been thinking well,

374
00:21:12.670 --> 00:21:16.590
what if Hitler decided to take over Austria? And in 1938, as you know,

375
00:21:16.970 --> 00:21:20.470
he did just that on March the 12th German tanks rolled across the border

376
00:21:20.750 --> 00:21:23.670
annexing, Austria into the third rock on the streets of Vienna.

377
00:21:23.671 --> 00:21:27.500
People lined up to cheer. The Nazis buildings were draped in stickers.

378
00:21:27.600 --> 00:21:30.220
Street parties were held all alone in his apartment.

379
00:21:30.430 --> 00:21:35.340
Freud simply noted two words in his diary, Finn Austria by this stage,

380
00:21:35.550 --> 00:21:38.860
Freud was nearly dead from the cancer that had spread throughout his system.

381
00:21:38.960 --> 00:21:42.220
He was a walking cadaver that couldn't even make it to the family summer house

382
00:21:42.221 --> 00:21:44.820
outside of Vienna. When people suggested he'd leave the country,

383
00:21:45.200 --> 00:21:49.130
he told them it would never happen nor would have had it not been for what

384
00:21:49.290 --> 00:21:53.170
happened to Anna on March the 22nd, Anna Freud was arrested by the gustapo.

385
00:21:53.280 --> 00:21:57.210
They ruthlessly interrogated her for hours before throwing her back out onto the

386
00:21:57.211 --> 00:21:57.710
street.

387
00:21:57.710 --> 00:22:01.610
The incident shook the elderly Freud to his core and the next day he decided to

388
00:22:01.611 --> 00:22:05.690
leave Austria. But this, it was easier said than done under the new Nazi regime.

389
00:22:05.710 --> 00:22:07.970
The whereabouts of Jews were closely tracked the,

390
00:22:08.040 --> 00:22:10.200
even the country required a special exit visa.

391
00:22:10.300 --> 00:22:12.560
And you can guess how often the Gustavo handed those out.

392
00:22:12.561 --> 00:22:15.640
Thankfully Freud had three very important people on his side.

393
00:22:15.820 --> 00:22:19.400
The first was his patient Marie Bonna apart. The second was William bull.

394
00:22:19.540 --> 00:22:21.040
The us ambassador in Vienna.

395
00:22:21.340 --> 00:22:26.200
The third was less expected Kaar Anden Saral was, uh, died in the world,

396
00:22:26.480 --> 00:22:28.790
Nazi tasked with overseeing Jews in that,

397
00:22:28.930 --> 00:22:32.550
but Saal was also a former student of one of Freud's closest friends.

398
00:22:32.730 --> 00:22:35.990
He had spent all of his years of study learning to respect the famous doctor.

399
00:22:36.250 --> 00:22:38.230
So when he discovered Freud was looking for an out,

400
00:22:38.610 --> 00:22:43.310
he decided to help him that spring Saral secured exit visas for Freud in 16 of

401
00:22:43.311 --> 00:22:44.670
his family members elsewhere,

402
00:22:44.950 --> 00:22:48.470
princess Murray was using her vast fortune to grease as many palms as possible.

403
00:22:48.520 --> 00:22:52.420
While William bull was applying diplomatic pressure. After three months,

404
00:22:52.440 --> 00:22:55.700
the Freud were finally given the all clear to leave Austria for England.

405
00:22:55.920 --> 00:22:59.820
The rides of London must have been both hopeful and heartbreaking here was Freud

406
00:22:59.821 --> 00:23:02.460
finally fulfilling his teenage dreams to live in England.

407
00:23:02.480 --> 00:23:04.700
But under the gloomiest of circumstances,

408
00:23:05.120 --> 00:23:08.740
it probably didn't help that all four of Freud's elderly sisters had been unable

409
00:23:08.741 --> 00:23:12.090
to get exit via. Although Freud wouldn't live long enough to hear the news.

410
00:23:12.510 --> 00:23:16.050
All four would perish in concentration camps on the 6th of June,

411
00:23:16.450 --> 00:23:20.930
1938 Freud and his family finally arrived in London by train worded,

412
00:23:20.931 --> 00:23:22.290
leaked out into huge crowd,

413
00:23:22.310 --> 00:23:25.370
had gathered to welcome the world's most famous psychoanalyst.

414
00:23:25.390 --> 00:23:27.810
As he saw the rose upon rows of people, cheering,

415
00:23:28.100 --> 00:23:30.360
Freud felt like it finally come home.

416
00:23:30.690 --> 00:23:34.640
Freud would live belly a year after reaching England's passing away on September

417
00:23:34.641 --> 00:23:38.840
the 23rd, 1939, just 20 days after Britain declared war on Germany.

418
00:23:38.980 --> 00:23:43.320
He kept receiving patients almost until the very ends when the author HG Wells

419
00:23:43.321 --> 00:23:47.480
came to visit Freud confided in him that it had always been a fantasy of his to

420
00:23:47.481 --> 00:23:52.200
be an Englishman in hiss own strange way that fantasy had come true today.

421
00:23:52.201 --> 00:23:56.200
It's fashionable to knock Freud's theories to poke fun at his experiments with

422
00:23:56.201 --> 00:23:58.320
cocaine and his obsession with sex.

423
00:23:58.630 --> 00:24:02.520
Certainly there are few psychiatrists today who would say that Freud's methods

424
00:24:02.521 --> 00:24:07.150
were completely sound yet just focus on Freud's medical work is to miss the

425
00:24:07.151 --> 00:24:08.990
point, no matter what you think of him,

426
00:24:09.160 --> 00:24:12.470
Freud completely transforms the way we understood the human mind.

427
00:24:12.620 --> 00:24:16.590
Just think about how often you hear of people having complexes or suffering from

428
00:24:16.591 --> 00:24:20.110
transference or having problems with mother or father figures.

429
00:24:20.320 --> 00:24:24.470
Think how deeply the ideas of psychoanalyst and childhood trauma of perpetrated

430
00:24:24.540 --> 00:24:25.220
into our,

431
00:24:25.220 --> 00:24:30.100
our fiction into our art think just of how significant surrealism became

432
00:24:30.620 --> 00:24:33.700
SI. Freud may have died exile unloved by his home country,

433
00:24:33.920 --> 00:24:38.780
but he also died the father of psychoanalysis and the greatest Explorer of

434
00:24:38.781 --> 00:24:43.340
the human mind for that reason, if for no other, he deserves to be remembered.

435
00:24:43.600 --> 00:24:46.090
