9
00:00:28.120 --> 00:00:30.070
Throughout the first half of the 20th century,

10
00:00:30.290 --> 00:00:33.310
the scourge of the Western world was polio every summer.

11
00:00:33.330 --> 00:00:37.750
It seemed it attacked at random sickening thousands across the United States and

12
00:00:37.751 --> 00:00:40.510
Europe. The ones that didn't kill overnight, it often left crippled,

13
00:00:40.950 --> 00:00:45.100
destroy the body's ability to control limbs and confining victims to wheelchairs

14
00:00:45.101 --> 00:00:46.180
and crutches for life.

15
00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:49.340
The west affected were unable to breathe without assistance from mechanical

16
00:00:49.490 --> 00:00:52.580
devices. Worst of all the disease, mostly attacked young children,

17
00:00:52.640 --> 00:00:56.860
making polio a appear worse nightmare since it struck without warning.

18
00:00:57.280 --> 00:01:01.340
And no one had a cure. Polio had an outsized impact on Western society.

19
00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:05.490
20th century, the fight against it causing improvements to medical science,

20
00:01:05.690 --> 00:01:07.690
philanthropy, disability rights,

21
00:01:07.691 --> 00:01:11.490
and the responsibility of government to protect its citizens from deadly

22
00:01:11.690 --> 00:01:14.890
pathogens today, the virus is almost nonexistent in the wild,

23
00:01:15.130 --> 00:01:19.610
a results of a concerted effort to eradicate this pestilence from humanity

24
00:01:19.960 --> 00:01:21.970
once and for all, but the effect it has on a,

25
00:01:22.060 --> 00:01:24.600
our world is likely to never be forgotten.

26
00:01:30.940 --> 00:01:33.520
The polio virus was first observed in 1909,

27
00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:38.360
and it is the pathogen that causes poliomyelitis typically shortened to polio.

28
00:01:38.380 --> 00:01:41.720
The virus primarily survives in the person's digestive system,

29
00:01:41.721 --> 00:01:45.870
especially the intestine. And when it remains there, it's completely harmless.

30
00:01:45.871 --> 00:01:50.710
95% people infected with poliovirus have no symptoms at all in

31
00:01:50.711 --> 00:01:51.790
5% of cases. However,

32
00:01:52.130 --> 00:01:55.790
the disease escapes from the digestive system and infects other parts of the

33
00:01:55.791 --> 00:01:58.750
body, particularly the central nervous system. Once there,

34
00:01:58.751 --> 00:02:02.110
the virus can interfere with the nervous system's ability to control muscles,

35
00:02:02.111 --> 00:02:04.940
such as the one need it to move your legs. Initially,

36
00:02:05.090 --> 00:02:07.180
this is felt to simply muscle weakness,

37
00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:12.060
but it can progress to partial or complete paralysis as nerves are damaged

38
00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:15.980
or destroyed. In many cases, the destruction is irreversible in,

39
00:02:16.080 --> 00:02:19.860
in the most severe cases can cause the loss of the ability to control the

40
00:02:19.861 --> 00:02:20.470
diaphragm,

41
00:02:20.470 --> 00:02:24.530
which is the muscle responsible for ensuring that your lungs function properly.

42
00:02:24.880 --> 00:02:28.330
This disease can cause the death of the victim unless they are put onto

43
00:02:28.331 --> 00:02:29.770
artificial breathing equipment.

44
00:02:36.180 --> 00:02:39.330
Polio has been observed throughout human history. Egyptian paintings,

45
00:02:39.570 --> 00:02:42.930
depict healthy people with withered limbs and children walking with canes

46
00:02:43.290 --> 00:02:45.400
thought to be represe of a polio infection.

47
00:02:45.540 --> 00:02:48.960
It is believed that the Roman emperor Claudias walked with a limp caused by

48
00:02:49.050 --> 00:02:53.040
polio. The Scottish Alta Scott is one of the first people to be confirmed,

49
00:02:53.180 --> 00:02:55.040
to have suffered about of polio as a child,

50
00:02:55.300 --> 00:02:59.200
as the science of disease was better understood at the end of the 17 hundreds

51
00:02:59.350 --> 00:03:02.560
continued study over the disease occurred throughout the 19th century.

52
00:03:02.820 --> 00:03:07.760
<v 1>And eventually it was Christ's infantile paralysis because of who it affected</v>

53
00:03:08.020 --> 00:03:12.520
and what it did still in all that time, the illness was a small scale problem.

54
00:03:12.700 --> 00:03:14.040
It was endemic. Sure,

55
00:03:14.060 --> 00:03:18.320
but it didn't rise to the level of epidemic such as those caused by small parks

56
00:03:18.440 --> 00:03:19.470
yet ALO fever or chole,

57
00:03:19.650 --> 00:03:23.990
but something changed in the latter half of the 19th century to bring polio out

58
00:03:24.020 --> 00:03:24.770
into the open.

59
00:03:24.770 --> 00:03:27.070
<v 0>The industrial revolution was in full swing,</v>

60
00:03:27.071 --> 00:03:29.710
causing people to move from rural areas to urban ones.

61
00:03:29.711 --> 00:03:32.070
Cities became overcrowded and poorly managed.

62
00:03:32.130 --> 00:03:36.310
As the explosion in population rapidly exceeded the capacity of existing

63
00:03:36.311 --> 00:03:40.700
infrastructure to handle them. People lived past gather in squali tenements.

64
00:03:40.701 --> 00:03:43.700
Malnutrition was rampant and the sanitation systems,

65
00:03:43.701 --> 00:03:47.940
particularly the sewers were overwhelmed. People infected with polio virus,

66
00:03:48.090 --> 00:03:49.420
shed it in their fecal matter.

67
00:03:49.560 --> 00:03:53.060
The virus can stay active for up to a week after leaving the body in this way,

68
00:03:53.090 --> 00:03:56.700
when human waste is being dumped into the same water sources that drinking water

69
00:03:56.840 --> 00:03:57.820
is being drawn from,

70
00:03:57.920 --> 00:04:01.730
people can become infected with of the virus from drinking contaminated water.

71
00:04:01.960 --> 00:04:04.690
Once a sufficient number of people are infected in this way,

72
00:04:04.870 --> 00:04:08.610
the virus can transmit itself from person to person through coming into contact

73
00:04:08.680 --> 00:04:09.970
with infected saliva,

74
00:04:10.040 --> 00:04:12.690
such as when standing close to a person who's talking to you.

75
00:04:12.710 --> 00:04:14.490
It is believed that in this way,

76
00:04:14.491 --> 00:04:18.210
virtually the entire population of the United States and Western Europe became

77
00:04:18.450 --> 00:04:20.920
infected with polio virus by the, of the 19th century.

78
00:04:21.380 --> 00:04:24.160
And the terrifying epidemics began soon after

79
00:04:30.500 --> 00:04:35.240
In 1916, polio struck the United States with a previously unseen fury.

80
00:04:35.260 --> 00:04:36.920
The epidemic centered on New York city,

81
00:04:36.921 --> 00:04:41.470
which saw 9,000 cases over 2000 of which were fatal Nationwides.

82
00:04:41.471 --> 00:04:44.470
There were over 27,000 afflicted and 6,000 deaths.

83
00:04:44.530 --> 00:04:48.830
The epidemic caused widespread panic in New York as public spaces were shut down

84
00:04:48.850 --> 00:04:51.070
and residents fled the city for the countryside.

85
00:04:51.430 --> 00:04:55.630
Families with polio victims were quarantines and were even publicly identified

86
00:04:55.631 --> 00:04:58.670
in local newspapers by that winter, the disease had subsided,

87
00:04:58.690 --> 00:05:00.630
but it proved to be the start of a pattern.

88
00:05:01.060 --> 00:05:04.860
Every summer polio emerged from its winter summer to plague the populations of

89
00:05:04.861 --> 00:05:06.540
the United States in Western Europe.

90
00:05:07.100 --> 00:05:09.300
Epidemics broke out all over the place with little warning.

91
00:05:09.560 --> 00:05:12.780
Two thirds of those affected were children between the ages of five to nine,

92
00:05:12.810 --> 00:05:15.500
leading it to become America's most feared disease.

93
00:05:15.520 --> 00:05:19.100
In the first half of the 20th century, the disease also affected adults though.

94
00:05:19.100 --> 00:05:20.820
It was less common in 1921.

95
00:05:21.060 --> 00:05:24.130
Franklin D Roosevelt was a rising star in the democratic party.

96
00:05:24.131 --> 00:05:27.610
Having been the party's vice presidential candidate in the 1920 election.

97
00:05:27.830 --> 00:05:31.050
The former assistant secretary of the Navy had returned to New York city after

98
00:05:31.051 --> 00:05:35.210
the Democrats lost the election to Warren G Harding and ran his own law firm

99
00:05:35.270 --> 00:05:38.130
biting his time until a new political opportunity came up.

100
00:05:38.310 --> 00:05:39.890
But while on vacation with his family,

101
00:05:40.040 --> 00:05:44.600
Roosevelt was struck down by no this eventually becoming completely paralyzed

102
00:05:44.601 --> 00:05:48.160
from the waist down at the time, Roosevelt was diagnosed with polio,

103
00:05:48.260 --> 00:05:52.480
but many doctors today argue that his symptoms more closely resemble ion bar

104
00:05:52.800 --> 00:05:56.080
syndrome and autoimmune disease. But for the purposes of this story,

105
00:05:56.140 --> 00:05:56.973
it doesn't really matter.

106
00:05:57.390 --> 00:06:01.400
Roosevelt became personally identified with polio for the rest of his life and

107
00:06:01.401 --> 00:06:05.440
helped lead the fight against the disease into his death. In 1945,

108
00:06:11.940 --> 00:06:15.320
FDR tried many different treatments to try and recover the ability to walk after

109
00:06:15.340 --> 00:06:18.950
his illness. In 1924, he visited a natural spring in warm Springs,

110
00:06:18.951 --> 00:06:22.150
Georgia believing hydrotherapy would help with his disability.

111
00:06:22.450 --> 00:06:24.830
It didn't not really, but in 1927,

112
00:06:25.010 --> 00:06:28.710
he bought a place and turned it into a rehabilitation center of a polio victims

113
00:06:28.790 --> 00:06:32.350
representing the first concentrated effort to combat the effects.

114
00:06:32.560 --> 00:06:35.830
Polio Roosevelt's of course would stage one of the most remarkable political

115
00:06:35.831 --> 00:06:38.980
comebacks in American history being elected governor of New York.

116
00:06:39.040 --> 00:06:42.140
And then in 1932 presidents of the United States,

117
00:06:42.360 --> 00:06:45.780
he took careful measures to ensure that his disability was not widely known to

118
00:06:45.781 --> 00:06:48.620
the public. He gave speeches while wearing heavy braces,

119
00:06:48.621 --> 00:06:50.700
that could be locked into place, allowing him to stand.

120
00:06:50.760 --> 00:06:54.220
He made a rough imitation of walking by juting his hips back and forth lifting

121
00:06:54.221 --> 00:06:55.180
his legs in the process.

122
00:06:55.600 --> 00:06:59.330
And he never allowed himself to be photographed or filmed one in his wheelchair.

123
00:06:59.540 --> 00:07:03.490
Still. He never forgot where he had come from and continued to develop his

124
00:07:03.491 --> 00:07:06.290
rehabilitation center in warm Springs. He turned to his friends,

125
00:07:06.510 --> 00:07:11.050
Baslow Connor to establish the national foundation for infantile paralysis in

126
00:07:11.250 --> 00:07:13.050
1938 to raise money for the foundation,

127
00:07:13.170 --> 00:07:17.170
a Connor established a new approach instead of only targeting wealthy patrons

128
00:07:17.171 --> 00:07:21.160
for large Don, he would ask the general public to donate small amounts.

129
00:07:21.180 --> 00:07:24.640
The campaign particularly invited children to send in 10 cent coins.

130
00:07:25.140 --> 00:07:28.000
The March of dimes campaign was incredibly successful.

131
00:07:28.100 --> 00:07:31.600
The white house received tens of thousands of letters with dimes in them,

132
00:07:31.670 --> 00:07:34.680
many donated from children who wanted their school mates to get well,

133
00:07:34.681 --> 00:07:38.480
which raised millions of dollars in the process. The March of dimes soon became,

134
00:07:38.790 --> 00:07:40.790
came short hands for the name of the foundation itself.

135
00:07:40.850 --> 00:07:44.470
And it is credited with being one of the first crowdfunded charitable giving

136
00:07:44.830 --> 00:07:47.790
campaigns. Roosevelt became so synonymous with the March of dimes,

137
00:07:47.791 --> 00:07:50.150
that after he died in office in 1945,

138
00:07:50.430 --> 00:07:52.870
a new dime was issued the next year with his face on it.

139
00:07:53.070 --> 00:07:54.870
A design that continues to this day,

140
00:07:55.000 --> 00:07:58.670
March of dimes used their donations to fund specialized treatment centers for

141
00:07:58.671 --> 00:07:59.540
polio patients,

142
00:07:59.541 --> 00:08:03.220
helping families pay for the costs of treatments and necessary equipment,

143
00:08:03.221 --> 00:08:06.980
such as iron lungs, which were artificial breathing devices for victims,

144
00:08:07.030 --> 00:08:10.060
whose diaphragms weren't working anymore. By the 1950s,

145
00:08:10.061 --> 00:08:14.460
over 80% of polio victims nationwide were receiving funding from the March of

146
00:08:14.470 --> 00:08:14.890
dimes.

147
00:08:14.890 --> 00:08:18.460
They also poured millions of dollars into research efforts to develop a polio

148
00:08:18.461 --> 00:08:21.450
vaccine, which would the disease once and for all. And look,

149
00:08:21.451 --> 00:08:24.530
if you're enjoying this exploration of the history of polio,

150
00:08:24.770 --> 00:08:27.730
I think you should consider giving today sponsor a look to,

151
00:08:27.790 --> 00:08:31.330
and that's curiosity stream curiosity stream is a subscription streaming service

152
00:08:31.331 --> 00:08:34.650

153
00:08:34.651 --> 00:08:37.890
world's best filmmakers, including exclusive originals. Now,

154
00:08:37.891 --> 00:08:40.640
if you've been enjoying the disease profiles we've done here on by biographics

155
00:08:40.650 --> 00:08:43.440
polio, the black deaths smallpox, just to name a few of them,

156
00:08:43.710 --> 00:08:45.760
then why not check out curiosity streams?

157
00:08:45.760 --> 00:08:48.280
Docu-series the body versus coronavirus.

158
00:08:48.390 --> 00:08:52.280
They actually have an entire section of content debated specifically two viruses

159
00:08:52.440 --> 00:08:52.801
and germs.

160
00:08:52.801 --> 00:08:56.640
So you'll definitely want to dive into that curiosity streams available on loads

161
00:08:56.641 --> 00:08:59.080
of apps. I normally list them all, but look, if you've got a screen,

162
00:08:59.460 --> 00:09:03.080
you can watch it on there. Very likely also it's available worldwide,

167
00:09:16.040 --> 00:09:19.990
keeps us making more videos. And I just think it's a really good match.

168
00:09:20.210 --> 00:09:21.470
So let's get back to the video.

169
00:09:27.850 --> 00:09:30.990
Dr. Jonas Sal had worked very hard to get where he was in life.

170
00:09:31.090 --> 00:09:34.630
The son of an immigrant Jewish family from New York city Sal had got it through

171
00:09:34.631 --> 00:09:37.900
his, under a graduate program at CCNY and medical school at NYU,

172
00:09:38.090 --> 00:09:41.820
largely thanks to his own brilliance and hard work. He had faced discrimination,

173
00:09:42.300 --> 00:09:44.540
economic hardship, but became a doctor anyway,

174
00:09:44.560 --> 00:09:48.620
but so did not want to practice medicine, his heart lay with medical research,

175
00:09:48.800 --> 00:09:52.420
the science of how disease affected the human body and how it could be

176
00:09:52.421 --> 00:09:54.220
prevented. In 1947,

177
00:09:54.620 --> 00:09:57.810
soak was running a small search laboratory at the university of Pittsburgh.

178
00:09:57.840 --> 00:09:59.770
When the March of dimes approached him,

179
00:09:59.880 --> 00:10:03.530
they needed help studying the polio virus and offered funding to hire more

180
00:10:03.730 --> 00:10:08.250
researchers and to enlarge his lab with better equipment SAR accepted at the

181
00:10:08.251 --> 00:10:12.290
time polio epidemics were getting worse in the United States in 19 49,

182
00:10:12.290 --> 00:10:15.930
40 2000 cases were reported in the us causing over 2000 death.

183
00:10:16.140 --> 00:10:21.040
The 1952 outbreak was the worst 58,000 confirmed cases of which 3000

184
00:10:21.150 --> 00:10:24.800
died. And almost 22,000 were left in some form of paralysis.

185
00:10:24.900 --> 00:10:27.200
The American public was almost hysterical,

186
00:10:27.201 --> 00:10:30.360
terrified that their children would be next to be afflicted BAS O'Connor.

187
00:10:30.640 --> 00:10:34.880
The head of the March of dimes knew that this had to be stopped in 1951.

188
00:10:35.320 --> 00:10:39.550
Conna meant Sal for the first Saul had an innovative idea for a vaccine and he

189
00:10:39.551 --> 00:10:41.310
wanted the March of dimes to help him with it.

190
00:10:41.370 --> 00:10:44.990
At the time so-called live virus vaccines were medical standard,

191
00:10:45.390 --> 00:10:48.430
a live virus vaccine also called an attenuated vaccine,

192
00:10:48.760 --> 00:10:51.830
takes a virus and changes it so that it is less virulent,

193
00:10:52.310 --> 00:10:55.710
less inoculating the body against the wild virus by introducing it in a safer

194
00:10:55.780 --> 00:10:59.180
form. So the immune system can produce antibodies against it.

195
00:10:59.290 --> 00:11:01.620
This is an effective way to make a vaccine,

196
00:11:01.840 --> 00:11:05.460
but it takes time a long time to perfect Dr.

197
00:11:05.460 --> 00:11:09.260
Albert Sabin working at his lab at the children's hospital in Cincinnati was

198
00:11:09.261 --> 00:11:11.700
leading the effort to make a live vaccine for polio.

199
00:11:11.840 --> 00:11:14.220
He brushed off upon his attempts to speed up his process,

200
00:11:14.221 --> 00:11:17.500
seemingly indifferent to the fact that children were getting sick and dying a

201
00:11:17.890 --> 00:11:20.570
while he was waiting to finish his work. SU on the other hand,

202
00:11:20.850 --> 00:11:24.970
proposed using an inactivated virus vaccine also called a dead virus vaccine.

203
00:11:25.150 --> 00:11:28.570
An inactivated virus vaccine uses a virus that has been killed,

204
00:11:28.571 --> 00:11:31.210
tricking the body into producing antibodies against it.

205
00:11:31.240 --> 00:11:34.690
This could be mass produced much faster than a live virus vaccine.

206
00:11:35.290 --> 00:11:38.920
So could first use this formula while working on an influenza vaccine for the us

207
00:11:39.160 --> 00:11:42.440
army majoring world war II and believed it would work for polio as well,

208
00:11:43.040 --> 00:11:46.200
Sabin and other medical researchers called SOS theory, junk science,

209
00:11:46.380 --> 00:11:49.880
but kind believed in anything that would get a vaccine to the public as soon as

210
00:11:50.040 --> 00:11:52.400
possible. And he agreed to fund SOS research

211
00:11:59.040 --> 00:12:01.000
Saul Toce in Pittsburgh, worked tirelessly.

212
00:12:01.001 --> 00:12:04.400
They achieved a breakthrough in late 1952. When a vaccine there developed,

213
00:12:04.420 --> 00:12:06.600
worked in a test on laboratory animals.

214
00:12:06.700 --> 00:12:09.480
The next step was human trials in early 1953,

215
00:12:09.840 --> 00:12:12.240
SAR tested his vaccine on a group of children and adults,

216
00:12:12.510 --> 00:12:15.710
including his own family and himself. No one got polio.

217
00:12:15.740 --> 00:12:19.550
More human trials were conducted throughout 1953 with similar results.

218
00:12:19.850 --> 00:12:24.430
Now O'Connor and Sal were ready to conduct a large scale human trial funded by

219
00:12:24.431 --> 00:12:27.630
the marcher dimes. The Francis field trial began in 1954, Dr.

220
00:12:27.631 --> 00:12:31.790
Thomas Francis of the university of Michigan Sal's Menza ran the trial with a

221
00:12:31.990 --> 00:12:33.940
staff of over 100, the year long trial,

222
00:12:33.941 --> 00:12:38.540
ultimately involved more than 1.8 million school children across the United

223
00:12:38.540 --> 00:12:41.460
States, the largest human medical experiment in American history.

224
00:12:41.600 --> 00:12:45.940
The world waited for the results with batted breath on April the 12th, 1955,

225
00:12:46.000 --> 00:12:50.140
the nation's press gathered Iraq and auditorium at the university of Michigan to

226
00:12:50.141 --> 00:12:53.380
hear the results of the field trial. The date was particularly significant.

227
00:12:53.530 --> 00:12:57.690
It was the 10th anniversary of the death of president Roosevelt, Sal Francis.

228
00:12:57.870 --> 00:13:00.890
And O'Connor informed the world that their vaccine worked,

229
00:13:01.040 --> 00:13:05.210
that it was safe and so that they would start mass producing it immediately.

230
00:13:05.350 --> 00:13:08.610
The news touched off widespread celebration across the country and the world.

231
00:13:08.790 --> 00:13:12.170
It was the culmination of almost 20 years of work from the March of dimes who

232
00:13:12.171 --> 00:13:15.600
had raised millions of dollars from millions of ordinary Americans.

233
00:13:15.700 --> 00:13:19.240
All in the hope of seeing this disease stopped medicine had the tools.

234
00:13:19.660 --> 00:13:21.960
Now it was time to stop the bug once and for all.

235
00:13:28.440 --> 00:13:28.441
Well,

236
00:13:28.441 --> 00:13:32.200
the effort to inoculate against polio was one of the largest vaccination efforts

237
00:13:32.201 --> 00:13:33.800
in human history. In the United States,

238
00:13:33.860 --> 00:13:38.030
new government regulations and oversight organizations needed to be created to

239
00:13:38.031 --> 00:13:42.190
control the quality of the manufactured vaccine doses to certify them as safe

240
00:13:42.210 --> 00:13:44.670
and to create records of who had been vaccinated,

241
00:13:44.800 --> 00:13:46.390
being vaccinated against polio.

242
00:13:46.391 --> 00:13:48.670
It became a requirements to attend public school,

243
00:13:48.690 --> 00:13:52.470
but few parents needed to be coerced into getting their children vaccinated.

244
00:13:52.820 --> 00:13:56.620
They CLAT for the chance to their children from the credit disease,

245
00:13:56.940 --> 00:13:58.660
a scandal erupts in 1955,

246
00:13:58.661 --> 00:14:02.020
when a batch of the polio vaccine manufactured by cut laboratories,

247
00:14:02.620 --> 00:14:06.140
actually infected hundreds of school children with the live polio vaccine

248
00:14:06.170 --> 00:14:07.340
instead of the safe version.

249
00:14:07.530 --> 00:14:10.260
This incident brought attention to the fact that the federal governments

250
00:14:10.380 --> 00:14:14.460
actually had little oversight of vaccine production and sought to rectify this

251
00:14:14.461 --> 00:14:16.610
immediately giving food and drug administration,

252
00:14:16.670 --> 00:14:19.690
the power to regulate vaccine formulas for quality and safety,

253
00:14:20.010 --> 00:14:24.210
a practice that continues to this day and gives the American consumer trust that

254
00:14:24.211 --> 00:14:26.010
the vaccines they are being given us safe.

255
00:14:26.110 --> 00:14:29.330
It didn't take long before the polio vaccine was being produced in large

256
00:14:29.331 --> 00:14:32.570
quantities. And the safety of the product was never questioned again,

257
00:14:32.790 --> 00:14:35.890
the March of dimes and the United States government jointly promoted the vaccine

258
00:14:36.080 --> 00:14:40.400
nation campaign and cases of polio began to drop precipitously. In 1952,

259
00:14:40.450 --> 00:14:44.120
there were 58,000 cases in the United States. In 1957,

260
00:14:44.330 --> 00:14:47.120
there were 5,600 by 1961.

261
00:14:47.380 --> 00:14:52.320
The us only recorded 161 cases that same year AB Sabins

262
00:14:52.560 --> 00:14:56.600
live virus, vaccine was ready to use. It was an oral vaccine as opposed to SOS,

263
00:14:56.601 --> 00:14:59.280
which was an injection. It was cheaper than Sox as well.

264
00:14:59.580 --> 00:15:03.480
Sabins vaccine eventually replaced Sox as the most commonly administered vaccine

265
00:15:03.590 --> 00:15:04.423
worldwide,

266
00:15:04.460 --> 00:15:08.240
but both doctors were hailed as heroes and they both received the presidential

267
00:15:08.241 --> 00:15:12.310
medal of freedom. America's highest civilian decoration. Most amazingly of all,

268
00:15:12.470 --> 00:15:13.170
perhaps is that no one,

269
00:15:13.170 --> 00:15:18.110
not so SA or O'Connor or anyone else made any attempt to patent their vaccine,

270
00:15:18.240 --> 00:15:21.110
which would've been worth billions of dollars to the patent holder.

271
00:15:21.330 --> 00:15:24.950
All of them said that this was for the public benefit and that they shouldn't

272
00:15:25.060 --> 00:15:26.390
therefore profit off of it.

273
00:15:26.540 --> 00:15:29.470
This allowed the vaccine to quickly make its way around the world.

274
00:15:35.790 --> 00:15:38.580
After 15 years, America wasn't afraid of polio anymore.

275
00:15:38.600 --> 00:15:42.340
The disease had been or conquered and most of America had moved on.

276
00:15:42.480 --> 00:15:45.980
But for the hundreds of thousands of people who had survived polio and been

277
00:15:45.981 --> 00:15:50.380
partially or totally disabled as a result, the vaccine did nothing to help them.

278
00:15:50.550 --> 00:15:53.970
After months or years spent in the hospital, they came home to discover.

279
00:15:53.971 --> 00:15:58.050
They now lived in a world that was seemingly designed to make their life more

280
00:15:58.051 --> 00:16:00.610
difficult in the fifties and sixties. There were few,

281
00:16:00.870 --> 00:16:04.370
if any protections for disabled people enshrined into law schools,

282
00:16:04.890 --> 00:16:08.170
businesses and other public places were almost never wheelchair accessible and

283
00:16:08.171 --> 00:16:10.370
few able bodied. People wanted to bother with them.

284
00:16:10.420 --> 00:16:14.120
Often they ended up shipped off to special schools for crippled children,

285
00:16:14.210 --> 00:16:17.280
where they could be hidden out of sight. And out of mind,

286
00:16:17.540 --> 00:16:20.680
as a new generation of children affected by polio grew to adulthood,

287
00:16:21.030 --> 00:16:22.920
they began to become more politically active.

288
00:16:23.150 --> 00:16:25.800
They were one of the largest disability groups in the country,

289
00:16:26.260 --> 00:16:30.280
and they were in the forefront of the disability rights movement that fought as

290
00:16:30.281 --> 00:16:34.310
part of the widest civil rights movement for equal access and equal treatment in

291
00:16:34.311 --> 00:16:34.940
society.

292
00:16:34.940 --> 00:16:38.710
This culminated in the passing of the Americans with disabilities act in 1990,

293
00:16:39.510 --> 00:16:42.510
mandating public accommodations for people with disabilities, wherever possible.

294
00:16:42.990 --> 00:16:46.110
Although there are relatively few polio survivors still alive today,

295
00:16:46.490 --> 00:16:50.310
all the progress that has been made in the rights of the disabled couldn't have

296
00:16:50.311 --> 00:16:51.750
been accomplished without their leadership

297
00:16:58.040 --> 00:17:00.500
In the United States. And most of the countries of Europe,

298
00:17:00.760 --> 00:17:05.020
the number of cases of polio dwindled down to zero throughout the 1970s and

299
00:17:05.021 --> 00:17:05.480
eighties,

300
00:17:05.480 --> 00:17:08.940
the vaccination programs in these countries were so successful in stamping out

301
00:17:08.941 --> 00:17:13.810
the disease that the w H O began to believe that the complete eradication of Leo

302
00:17:13.811 --> 00:17:14.690
was not only possible,

303
00:17:14.870 --> 00:17:17.930
but something that they could accomplish after small parks was declared

304
00:17:17.931 --> 00:17:19.210
eradicated in 1980,

305
00:17:19.211 --> 00:17:24.010
the w H O began to turn their attention more seriously to taking down polio by

306
00:17:24.170 --> 00:17:24.691
1988,

307
00:17:24.691 --> 00:17:29.210
there were an estimated 350,000 cases of paralytic polio worldwide,

308
00:17:29.310 --> 00:17:33.370
mostly occurring in poor countries with little access to modern medicine and

309
00:17:34.010 --> 00:17:35.400
unbel at sanitation facilities.

310
00:17:35.580 --> 00:17:39.760
The w H O announced a partnership with UNICEF and rotary international to launch

311
00:17:39.820 --> 00:17:43.960
the global polio eradication initiative with the goal of eradicating polio

312
00:17:43.961 --> 00:17:45.760
worldwide by the year 2000,

313
00:17:46.100 --> 00:17:50.880
the G E I M to vaccinate every person in countries where polio is still

314
00:17:50.881 --> 00:17:51.540
endemic.

315
00:17:51.540 --> 00:17:54.880
The initiative failed to completely eradicate the disease by the year 2000,

316
00:17:55.180 --> 00:17:56.960
but they had made terrific progress,

317
00:17:57.310 --> 00:18:00.760
575 million children were vaccinated through the campaign,

318
00:18:00.980 --> 00:18:05.320
almost a 10th of the world's population from 350,000 estimated cases in

319
00:18:05.480 --> 00:18:09.830
1988, the w H O recorded less than a thousand in the year,

320
00:18:09.831 --> 00:18:13.590
2005 years later with increased funding from the bill of Melinda gates

321
00:18:13.591 --> 00:18:17.510
foundation, polio was considered endemic in only four countries, India,

322
00:18:18.030 --> 00:18:19.390
Pakistan, Afghanistan,

323
00:18:19.530 --> 00:18:23.950
and Nigeria sweeping the disease out of these final places of refuge ran

324
00:18:24.300 --> 00:18:27.990
into unexpected challenges in adequate healthcare infrastructure poses,

325
00:18:28.150 --> 00:18:30.140
an obstacle in adding everyone vaccinated.

326
00:18:30.240 --> 00:18:34.700
And that's assuming that the people in charge of a particular area even want the

327
00:18:34.701 --> 00:18:36.060
vaccination program to go ahead.

328
00:18:36.110 --> 00:18:39.980
There have been entire sections of countries controlled by forces in opposition

329
00:18:39.981 --> 00:18:43.660
to it such as Boca Haram in Nigeria and the Taliban in Afghanistan.

330
00:18:43.810 --> 00:18:48.020
They view its as undue Western influence on their territory and rumors spread

331
00:18:48.021 --> 00:18:51.370
that the vaccines contain con contraceptives to keep women from becoming

332
00:18:51.690 --> 00:18:52.170
pregnant,

333
00:18:52.170 --> 00:18:55.410
although they will be damned by Allah because the vaccine contains products

334
00:18:55.411 --> 00:18:58.370
derived from pork. Things got even worse in 2011,

335
00:18:58.480 --> 00:19:02.690
when it came out that the CIA had used fake hepatitis B immunizations in

336
00:19:03.090 --> 00:19:07.010
Pakistan to get DNA samples from the occupants of a compound in an attempt to

337
00:19:07.070 --> 00:19:09.410
verify the presence of Osama bin Laden.

338
00:19:09.411 --> 00:19:13.920
There still eradication efforts proceeded as best they could with more success.

339
00:19:14.250 --> 00:19:18.760
Polio was eradicated in India as of 2014. And after some false starts,

340
00:19:18.820 --> 00:19:19.350
all of Africa,

341
00:19:19.350 --> 00:19:24.320
including Nigeria was declared polio free in 2020 only Afghanistan and

342
00:19:24.560 --> 00:19:29.240
Pakistan still have wild polio virus circulating about 125 cases

343
00:19:29.390 --> 00:19:32.550
have been reported in the two countries. So far this year,

344
00:19:32.700 --> 00:19:37.030
much of the polio eradication resources have been redirected this year to combat

345
00:19:37.090 --> 00:19:38.350
the COVID 19 pandemic.

346
00:19:38.370 --> 00:19:42.470
And the w H O is concerned that a resurgence in polio cases is coming,

347
00:19:42.770 --> 00:19:47.430
but even so health officials feel they are only a has rep away from

348
00:19:47.431 --> 00:19:49.470
finishing the polio virus off forever.

349
00:19:49.770 --> 00:19:52.860
The effects of polio on the way Western world can still be seen today.

350
00:19:52.861 --> 00:19:57.060
Special wards in hospitals designed to treat polio patients developed into the

351
00:19:57.061 --> 00:20:00.100
intensive care units that are a standard feature in hospitals today.

352
00:20:00.101 --> 00:20:03.700
Advancements in physical rehabilitation originally used on polio.

353
00:20:03.701 --> 00:20:06.060
Patients used today for all manner of physical ailments.

354
00:20:06.160 --> 00:20:09.980
The concept of crowdfunding collecting small donations from many people as

355
00:20:09.981 --> 00:20:14.210
opposed to large donations from a few wealthy people was first established as

356
00:20:14.211 --> 00:20:17.210
viable through the work of the March of dimes. Today,

357
00:20:17.211 --> 00:20:21.770
crowdfunding is a cornerstone of all major non-profit fundraising and has

358
00:20:21.771 --> 00:20:25.730
expanded into the areas of political campaigning and in private fundraising

359
00:20:25.731 --> 00:20:28.210
efforts, such as GoFundMe campaigns. Finally,

360
00:20:28.750 --> 00:20:33.120
the widespread implementation of the polio vaccine laid the for government

361
00:20:33.121 --> 00:20:37.760
regulation and control of the vaccine industry and mandatory vaccinations for

362
00:20:37.761 --> 00:20:38.560
public school.

363
00:20:38.560 --> 00:20:43.240
Children persist to this day leading to a direct reduction in communicable

364
00:20:43.241 --> 00:20:47.200
diseases worldwide. As the world today is dealing with the COVID 19 pandemic.

365
00:20:47.500 --> 00:20:52.240
We can look back hearteningly on the successful fight against diseases like

366
00:20:52.450 --> 00:20:56.320
polio and realize that as long as we are willing to put forth the same effort,

367
00:20:56.740 --> 00:21:00.440
we can beat this disease as effectively as we did the polio virus.

368
00:21:00.980 --> 00:21:03.080
