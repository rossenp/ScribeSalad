<v 0>This video is brought to you by policy genius.</v>

00:00:02.020 --> 00:00:05.360
If you have family members who depends on your income, you need life insurance.

3
00:00:05.361 --> 00:00:08.760
That's where policy genius comes in more on images to bits.

4
00:00:14.660 --> 00:00:18.840
His name is synonymous with AAT corruption for 20 years further.

5
00:00:19.160 --> 00:00:22.830
And Marco ruled the Philippines first as its democratically elected president.

6
00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:27.310
Then as its iron fisted dictator at home,

7
00:00:27.370 --> 00:00:30.190
his regime was defined by its authoritarianism.

8
00:00:30.191 --> 00:00:32.190
During the years of Marshall law,

9
00:00:32.330 --> 00:00:35.710
it estimated around 3000 political prisoners were murdered.

10
00:00:35.711 --> 00:00:38.550
While another 40,000 were tortured to the rest of the world. Though,

11
00:00:38.551 --> 00:00:42.780
there was one major theme of the mark OSS corruption corruption on a scale.

12
00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:47.300
So eye watering history has rarely seen anything like it.

13
00:00:47.780 --> 00:00:48.860
There's absolute ruler of his country,

14
00:00:49.220 --> 00:00:52.700
Marcus and his wife and Mel had plundered the state treasury using public funds

15
00:00:52.720 --> 00:00:57.180
to buy everything from luxury villas to synthesize diamonds to a thousand pairs

16
00:00:57.181 --> 00:01:00.220
of designer shoes, all told they thought to have stolen

17
00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:05.090
$5 billion from the Philippines at a time when millions were going hungry and

18
00:01:05.091 --> 00:01:09.010
underfunded hospitals couldn't afford anesthetic today biographics is

19
00:01:09.011 --> 00:01:13.930
investigating the story of how one man managed to turn an entire nation into his

20
00:01:14.170 --> 00:01:15.090
personal piggy bank.

21
00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:25.160
In years, an Marco like to boast about his pre presidential achievements,

22
00:01:25.480 --> 00:01:28.640
how it won more medals than any other gorilla fighter resisting the Japanese,

23
00:01:28.940 --> 00:01:32.240
how he had been the greatest marksman in the history of the ROTC,

24
00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:34.280
but there was one part of his CV.

25
00:01:34.281 --> 00:01:38.280
The dictator had always kept quiet that in addition to his expensive education

26
00:01:38.300 --> 00:01:42.480
and sparkling law career, he was also a convicted murderer. Third in and,

27
00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:45.670
and Manuel ARA. Marcos was born on September the 11th,

28
00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:50.990
1917 in ICOT Norte, northerly province known for its tobacco plantations.

29
00:01:51.590 --> 00:01:52.790
Wildlife of many in the area was hard.

30
00:01:52.791 --> 00:01:55.510
The future dictator was brought up in relative comfort.

31
00:01:55.770 --> 00:02:00.350
His mother came from a land owning family while his father Maria was a local

32
00:02:00.351 --> 00:02:03.300
politician. At least that's the official story decades.

33
00:02:03.390 --> 00:02:05.420
There have been rumors that the boy's godfather,

34
00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:08.620
a judge named th an qu was his real dad.

35
00:02:08.760 --> 00:02:11.740
And these rumors were fueled by the money qu lavished on the family,

36
00:02:11.790 --> 00:02:13.940
regardless of his true heritage though,

37
00:02:14.340 --> 00:02:17.180
Marco always stood loyally by the man that he called father.

38
00:02:17.400 --> 00:02:21.500
It was a trait that would soon Lando in some serious hot water. In 1925,

39
00:02:21.860 --> 00:02:24.810
Maria won election to the house of representatives of the Philippines.

40
00:02:25.130 --> 00:02:27.290
Then a part of the insular government. At the time,

41
00:02:27.291 --> 00:02:30.850
the Philippines was a us colony swiped from Spain at the end of the Spanish

42
00:02:31.210 --> 00:02:34.810
American war, but with its own legislature for internal matters,

43
00:02:34.980 --> 00:02:36.330
since it was based in Manila,

44
00:02:36.390 --> 00:02:40.370
the family moved to the capital that Marco settled into the privileged life of a

45
00:02:40.371 --> 00:02:42.450
politician's son. He attended a good school,

46
00:02:42.480 --> 00:02:47.160
took up hobbies like boxing and shooting. Even when Maria lost his seat in 1932,

47
00:02:47.161 --> 00:02:50.880
the now teenage boy stayed on studying law at the university of the Philippines

48
00:02:50.970 --> 00:02:54.280
there as part of the reserve officer's training Corps or R OTC,

49
00:02:54.420 --> 00:02:57.600
he became one of the country's star marksman. And yes,

50
00:02:57.750 --> 00:03:00.880
that fact is going to be significant in 1935,

51
00:03:00.881 --> 00:03:04.800
the us altered the colony status grounding further autonomy. Importantly,

52
00:03:04.870 --> 00:03:07.120
this meant the creation of a new national assembly.

53
00:03:07.380 --> 00:03:11.760
The assembly that Mariano was determined to be a part of that September Marcus's

54
00:03:11.761 --> 00:03:16.160
dad went up against ju Nuen for their district seat to the family's shark.

55
00:03:16.310 --> 00:03:17.143
Mariano lost.

56
00:03:17.560 --> 00:03:21.270
No Anderson's supported are celebrated by having the Marcus family name engraved

57
00:03:21.271 --> 00:03:22.990
on a coffin that they dragged through the streets,

58
00:03:23.330 --> 00:03:25.990
but it wouldn't be Mariano who needed that wooden box.

59
00:03:26.220 --> 00:03:30.590
Just two days later on September the 20th Nison was brushing his teeth at home.

60
00:03:30.591 --> 00:03:34.870
When he was shot through the window and killed with a single 22 caliber bullet,

61
00:03:35.170 --> 00:03:36.550
it was the sort of assassination.

62
00:03:36.551 --> 00:03:41.260
Only a trained marksman could have pulled off person who spent hours each

63
00:03:41.360 --> 00:03:43.220
day practicing on the range.

64
00:03:43.700 --> 00:03:47.780
A person like Ferna Marco arrested Anson's murder.

65
00:03:48.380 --> 00:03:53.100
Marcos was convicted in 1939 handed a sentence of 10 to 17 years while in jail,

66
00:03:53.120 --> 00:03:55.820
he kept up his law study soon, acing the bar exam.

67
00:03:55.821 --> 00:03:58.020
When he came time for the Supreme court to hear his appeal,

68
00:03:58.580 --> 00:04:00.010
Marcos decided to represen himself.

69
00:04:00.230 --> 00:04:03.050
It was a decision that would make his career. In course,

70
00:04:03.570 --> 00:04:05.410
Marcos blew everyone away with his speaking skills,

71
00:04:05.710 --> 00:04:09.490
his charisma and his grasp of legal knowledge. At one point he admitted,

72
00:04:09.590 --> 00:04:12.970
he knew the law so well that he could recite the constitution backwards.

73
00:04:13.250 --> 00:04:15.730
That proceeded to do just that stunt,

74
00:04:15.731 --> 00:04:19.090
which the reporters ate up by the time the court ruled in October, 1940,

75
00:04:19.160 --> 00:04:21.040
they were eager to own return his conviction,

76
00:04:21.300 --> 00:04:23.760
but not because they thought he was innocent as justice.

77
00:04:24.360 --> 00:04:28.200
Jose B Laurel argued the Commonwealth would need such brilliant young men once

78
00:04:28.330 --> 00:04:32.480
freed from American rule. The case turns Marcus into a celebrity and Manila,

79
00:04:32.640 --> 00:04:36.400
a hero to the sort of clients that he now represented at his dad's law firm.

80
00:04:36.500 --> 00:04:39.760
But the brilliant young man wasn't finished yet within 25 years,

81
00:04:40.360 --> 00:04:43.790
he'd have gone on from promising kin to leader of his country

82
00:04:50.210 --> 00:04:54.350
In the ends Marcus' work in Mariano's law firm lasted barely a year on December

83
00:04:54.351 --> 00:04:55.550
the eighth, 1941,

84
00:04:55.551 --> 00:04:59.590
Japan invaded the Philippines opening a whole new front in world war II.

85
00:04:59.591 --> 00:05:03.220
What happened next? Depends on. He talked to according to his supporters,

86
00:05:03.330 --> 00:05:08.140
Marcus' wartime exploits were basically Asian Rambo captured by the

87
00:05:08.300 --> 00:05:08.640
Japanese.

88
00:05:08.640 --> 00:05:12.900
He survived the infamous Baton death Mount only to be tortured at camp Donnell.

89
00:05:12.901 --> 00:05:17.820
One of the Pacifics deadliest pow camps, but rather than succumb Marcus escaped,

90
00:05:17.821 --> 00:05:21.300
fleeing into the mountains from where he proceeded to rain held down on the

91
00:05:21.500 --> 00:05:24.530
occupy long army as one of the highest decorated gorilla pointers in the

92
00:05:24.531 --> 00:05:24.990
Philippines,

93
00:05:24.990 --> 00:05:28.930
Marcos coordinated with us intelligence to help America recapture the islands.

94
00:05:29.210 --> 00:05:30.970
Although his father was executed by the Japanese,

95
00:05:31.230 --> 00:05:33.890
the young lawyer continued to fight earning a reputation.

96
00:05:33.950 --> 00:05:37.850
So mythic the peasants believed he could deflect bullets or vanish into smoke.

97
00:05:37.960 --> 00:05:41.490
This version of the story ends like the final scenes of a new hope with uncle

98
00:05:41.660 --> 00:05:46.600
Sam's layer greatly showering medals down onto Marcus'

99
00:05:46.960 --> 00:05:47.740
hunky hand solo,

100
00:05:47.740 --> 00:05:51.200
but there is another version of version that claims Marco did none of this,

101
00:05:51.201 --> 00:05:54.440
that the us has no record of ever rewarding him, any medals,

102
00:05:54.500 --> 00:05:56.160
and that Marco spend the war not fighting,

103
00:05:56.180 --> 00:05:58.840
but making a killing on the black market in this version.

104
00:05:59.070 --> 00:06:03.000
Even Mariano's death is different executed for collaborating with the Japanese

105
00:06:03.460 --> 00:06:06.480
in the ends though, it doesn't really matter which one of these was true.

106
00:06:06.650 --> 00:06:10.280
Marco simply used the full force of his charisma to make everyone believe the

107
00:06:10.281 --> 00:06:11.960
version most flattering to him.

108
00:06:12.060 --> 00:06:16.280
The result was a nation that felt eternally in his death in 1946,

109
00:06:16.510 --> 00:06:19.350
just after the us granted the Philippines full independence.

110
00:06:19.830 --> 00:06:21.990
Marco became a special assistant to the new president,

111
00:06:21.991 --> 00:06:25.230
opening up endless networking opportunities. At the same time,

112
00:06:25.290 --> 00:06:29.270
he relaunched his career as a lawyer now trading on his war hero reputation to

113
00:06:29.340 --> 00:06:32.710
attract big clients. But all this was really just a stepping stone,

114
00:06:32.830 --> 00:06:35.750
a single step forward on the past Virgin ends.

115
00:06:36.270 --> 00:06:40.340
Marcos had already laid out for himself the path to absolute power.

116
00:06:40.560 --> 00:06:44.660
We can see this from the moment he lodged his political career in 1949,

117
00:06:44.661 --> 00:06:46.820
running on a liberal party ticket for the lower house.

118
00:06:47.180 --> 00:06:48.820
Marco told voters in his native area.

119
00:06:49.080 --> 00:06:53.940
If you are electing me just to get my services for the pits of 7,500

120
00:06:54.300 --> 00:06:57.460
paces a year, don't vote for me at all. This is only a first step.

121
00:06:58.130 --> 00:06:59.370
Elect me a Congressman now,

122
00:06:59.510 --> 00:07:04.250
and I pledge you an &lt;inaudible&gt; presidents in 20 years. In fact,

123
00:07:04.310 --> 00:07:08.010
it would take even less time than that elected in no small part due to his war

124
00:07:08.011 --> 00:07:12.210
record. Marco became a fixture on Manila's political scene. He was young,

125
00:07:12.320 --> 00:07:15.250
wealthy, a staunch reformer, and a powerful lawyer.

126
00:07:15.550 --> 00:07:19.080
Now all he needed was a wife worthy of his ambition. In 1954,

127
00:07:19.170 --> 00:07:21.600
Marco met Imelda Romeu EZ,

128
00:07:22.360 --> 00:07:25.160
miss Manila winner from an obscenely well connected family.

129
00:07:25.330 --> 00:07:27.080
After a courtship of just 11 days,

130
00:07:27.081 --> 00:07:30.440
they married Marco gifted as bride and 11 Kara diamond,

131
00:07:30.700 --> 00:07:34.560
one carrot for each day that did known her from that day fourth Imelda Marcos

132
00:07:34.561 --> 00:07:35.920
would be infamous in her own, right,

133
00:07:36.180 --> 00:07:39.830
but we'll save her story for a potential future video for now.

134
00:07:40.070 --> 00:07:42.110
All we'll do is note that the couple soon had children,

135
00:07:42.370 --> 00:07:45.030
two of whom daughter reme and son bong,

136
00:07:45.120 --> 00:07:48.670
would become almost as notorious as their dad by 1963,

137
00:07:48.910 --> 00:07:51.670
third and M Marco seemed to have it all. He was now president of the Senate,

138
00:07:51.730 --> 00:07:53.790
one of the most powerful posts in the nation.

139
00:07:54.050 --> 00:07:58.070
He was a darling of the trade unions, passionate advocate, land reform,

140
00:07:58.230 --> 00:08:00.380
and one of the liberal parties, rising stars.

141
00:08:00.520 --> 00:08:05.500
But even this couldn't sat the appetite of the ambitious boy from St. Norte,

142
00:08:05.800 --> 00:08:07.940
not when he could still go higher,

143
00:08:08.320 --> 00:08:11.060
not when Marcus could run for presidents.

144
00:08:17.460 --> 00:08:17.461
See,

145
00:08:17.461 --> 00:08:20.650
here's the problem with Marcus' plan to run for president on the liberal party

146
00:08:20.970 --> 00:08:22.890
tickets, the liberal party already had a president,

147
00:08:23.530 --> 00:08:26.930
but Marcos wasn't about to let a silly little thing like his whole party saying,

148
00:08:27.190 --> 00:08:32.170
bro, seriously, our guys already in charge. Stop him from running in 1965,

149
00:08:32.171 --> 00:08:37.010
he switched parties becoming the nominee for his former rivals the NA LEAs under

150
00:08:37.030 --> 00:08:39.970
the slogan. This nation can be great. Again, sound for,

151
00:08:40.580 --> 00:08:44.680
he went on to trounce the encumbered president winning nearly 52% of the vote.

152
00:08:44.740 --> 00:08:45.573
And just like that,

153
00:08:45.640 --> 00:08:48.440
Virgin and Marcus was the Philippines head honcho to be fair.

154
00:08:48.441 --> 00:08:51.960
The writing had been on the wall from the moments that had won the national

155
00:08:52.320 --> 00:08:53.960
least as nomination so far,

156
00:08:54.020 --> 00:08:57.040
no post-independence president had managed to win a second term.

157
00:08:57.560 --> 00:09:01.120
Little could anyone have known that Marcus would wind up serving as long as his

158
00:09:01.230 --> 00:09:03.600
five predecessors combined at first,

159
00:09:03.740 --> 00:09:07.760
the election of her Marcos didn't seem like a major historic shift in his first

160
00:09:08.040 --> 00:09:08.041
time,

161
00:09:08.041 --> 00:09:11.360
the new president did some predictable stuff like backing the us in the Vietnam

162
00:09:11.660 --> 00:09:15.670
war and some controversial stuff like sending 2000 Pinot troops to help.

163
00:09:15.730 --> 00:09:19.950
He also did some populous stuff like cracking down or corruption and some useful

164
00:09:19.951 --> 00:09:23.630
stuff like repairing roads and sewage systems for anyone alive. At the time,

165
00:09:23.631 --> 00:09:27.110
it would've felt less like the beginning of a dictatorship and more like,

166
00:09:27.220 --> 00:09:30.830
well business. As usual, aside from the first couples ostentatious lifestyle,

167
00:09:30.831 --> 00:09:32.910
people called them the Filipino Kennedys.

168
00:09:33.270 --> 00:09:38.020
There was nothing to really mark Marco out from previous one town wonders until

169
00:09:38.021 --> 00:09:41.140
that is he won his second term. Marcus' 1969.

170
00:09:41.141 --> 00:09:45.620
Reelection hits political circles like a Thunderbolt in an era when no one got a

171
00:09:45.621 --> 00:09:49.260
second term here was burden and Marco still enjoying the Goodwill of the people.

172
00:09:49.640 --> 00:09:52.180
At least that's how the president's office spun it.

173
00:09:52.280 --> 00:09:56.130
The opposition claim that Marcus had used intimidation and violence to get votes

174
00:09:56.131 --> 00:09:57.930
that he had spent state funds on his campaign,

175
00:09:57.931 --> 00:10:01.730
that he was already planning an illegal third term as 1970 dawned.

176
00:10:01.730 --> 00:10:04.930
It was still just about possible to look at Marcus and see an ordinary

177
00:10:04.931 --> 00:10:07.130
politician. One who played dirty,

178
00:10:07.550 --> 00:10:10.730
but wasn't on a par with some Latin American autocrat,

179
00:10:11.260 --> 00:10:13.610
sadly that illusion wouldn't survive the oncoming storm,

180
00:10:13.870 --> 00:10:15.530
not today's the first quarter storm.

181
00:10:15.560 --> 00:10:18.040
That course cyclone basically did for the Philippines.

182
00:10:18.070 --> 00:10:21.800
What the Galveston hurricane did for Texas as Markos began.

183
00:10:22.000 --> 00:10:25.400
His second term insane social current were swirling creating a highly volatile

184
00:10:25.800 --> 00:10:26.010
cocktail.

185
00:10:26.010 --> 00:10:29.240
There was brewing resentment at Filipino involvement in the Vietnam war,

186
00:10:29.360 --> 00:10:32.920
a growing pushback against us. Imperialism upheaval on campuses.

187
00:10:33.190 --> 00:10:37.750
Cripplingly low wages for the poor were causing problems as upcoming price hikes

188
00:10:37.751 --> 00:10:39.470
out in rural areas of fledgling.

189
00:10:39.471 --> 00:10:42.790
Communist insurgency was taking holes when Marco delivered his state of the

190
00:10:42.791 --> 00:10:45.310
nation address on January the 27th, 1970,

191
00:10:45.690 --> 00:10:49.190
it was the trigger for all of those resentments to finally explode on January

192
00:10:49.290 --> 00:10:53.190
the 30th tsunami of protest descended on the president's Malang palace

193
00:10:53.590 --> 00:10:56.270
determined to break sight protest just tried to scale the walls.

194
00:10:56.450 --> 00:10:59.220
Guards open fired. Someone drove a truck at the front gates.

195
00:10:59.390 --> 00:11:03.500
Eventually the demonstrators were driven back to Mendiola that the police

196
00:11:03.501 --> 00:11:07.300
attacked killing five in the aftermath. Marcos declared the protests,

197
00:11:07.540 --> 00:11:11.340
an attack on democracy that the storm did end across February and March middle

198
00:11:11.620 --> 00:11:12.780
the streets boiled with rage.

199
00:11:13.300 --> 00:11:16.180
There were running battles between police and students bar bombings,

200
00:11:16.181 --> 00:11:17.770
reprisals by security for horses.

201
00:11:18.110 --> 00:11:22.890
The us embassy had its lobby trashed strikes and mass protests paralyzed the

202
00:11:22.891 --> 00:11:23.310
capital.

203
00:11:23.310 --> 00:11:27.130
It was a how of rage that depending on your politics was either a necessary

204
00:11:27.131 --> 00:11:30.010
release or a sign of the coming communists takeover.

205
00:11:30.190 --> 00:11:33.370
The storm finally ebbed after March the 17th, but it didn't die.

206
00:11:33.371 --> 00:11:37.170
The anger simply hid below the surface just bubbling away.

207
00:11:37.350 --> 00:11:41.120
It seems now Marcos recognized this the long after the storm debated,

208
00:11:41.121 --> 00:11:44.040
he went to the military and asked them to draw up hypothetical plans,

209
00:11:44.350 --> 00:11:46.360
preparation for if the worst happened.

210
00:11:46.530 --> 00:11:50.560
These plans were to implement martial law across the Philippines within no time

211
00:11:50.561 --> 00:11:53.200
at all. They were going to move from the realm of hypothetical.

212
00:11:53.920 --> 00:11:56.280
That of terrifying reality. Now for a lot of people,

213
00:11:56.330 --> 00:12:00.120
there is no more terrifying reality than sudden death that leaves your family

214
00:12:00.150 --> 00:12:02.480
destitute. That's why life insurance is so crucial.

And let's get back to today's video

240
00:13:23.950 --> 00:13:27.640
Reading about the months leading up to Marshall law today is like reading some

241
00:13:27.641 --> 00:13:31.440
awful novel where the protagonists are pulled inexorably towards disaster.

242
00:13:31.750 --> 00:13:35.790
Each chapter brings some new radical set, some new tragedy,

243
00:13:36.090 --> 00:13:40.630
the most tragic of which may be the chapter titled Plaza Miranda in

244
00:13:40.631 --> 00:13:41.630
August, 1971.

245
00:13:41.650 --> 00:13:44.790
As the liberal party gathered there to unveil its newest candidates.

246
00:13:44.820 --> 00:13:49.310
Someone threw two grenades onto the stage. The blasts ripped apart nine people,

247
00:13:49.311 --> 00:13:52.390
including a young girl and left nearly a hundred with gruesome wounds.

248
00:13:52.830 --> 00:13:54.990
Although the liberals blamed Marco, the president in Sioux,

249
00:13:55.540 --> 00:13:58.300
the communist and surgeons were behind the deaths. Two days later,

250
00:13:58.360 --> 00:14:01.380
he suspended theri of habeas Corpus mass arrests followed,

251
00:14:01.560 --> 00:14:04.980
but the chaos was only just the beginning on March the 15th, 1972,

252
00:14:05.060 --> 00:14:07.980
an Ince device exploded in Manila rather than a one off.

253
00:14:07.981 --> 00:14:11.020
It was the start of a bombing spree across the capital's Metro area.

254
00:14:11.090 --> 00:14:12.100
Over the next six months,

255
00:14:12.101 --> 00:14:16.930
20 blasts skilled one person and injured 40 as disasters piled up Barco started

256
00:14:17.290 --> 00:14:19.090
denouncing the opposition as communists.

257
00:14:19.110 --> 00:14:22.850
He started claiming it soon need emergency powers to deal with the rising tide

258
00:14:22.851 --> 00:14:26.890
of violence in the land. His rhetoric got so heated that popular law maker,

259
00:14:27.250 --> 00:14:28.170
Ben NIGO, a queen Jr.

260
00:14:28.190 --> 00:14:31.410
Better known as Nino claims in the Senate that had found evidence of a secret

261
00:14:31.440 --> 00:14:34.050
plan to place Manila under martial law. Sadly,

262
00:14:34.051 --> 00:14:38.120
that knowledge came too late for anyone to on September the 22nd government

263
00:14:38.320 --> 00:14:40.960
minister, Juan Ponson relay was driving home.

264
00:14:41.030 --> 00:14:43.960
When his car was ambushed by communists and sprayed with bullets,

265
00:14:43.961 --> 00:14:47.280
it was a miracle that on relay managed to get away such a miracle. In fact,

266
00:14:47.440 --> 00:14:49.600
and that most assumed the attack was staged still.

267
00:14:49.750 --> 00:14:53.280
This was all the pretext that Marco needed. It's still a mystery. Exactly.

268
00:14:53.350 --> 00:14:58.040
When proclamation number 1081 was signed implementing Marshall law.

269
00:14:58.400 --> 00:15:00.640
Some say Marco signed it immediately after the Ambu,

270
00:15:00.800 --> 00:15:04.640
Sean and relay others say that it secretly signed it the day before on September

271
00:15:04.641 --> 00:15:07.040
the 21st, since 21 is visible by seven.

272
00:15:07.041 --> 00:15:10.950
And Marco was famously obsessed with that number, regardless of the time though,

273
00:15:11.090 --> 00:15:13.310
the results were the same as the clock tick midnight,

274
00:15:13.311 --> 00:15:17.550
Senator Nemo keynote was arrested and he was just the first over the early hours

275
00:15:17.570 --> 00:15:20.870
of September, the 23rd, 1972, some 400 journalists,

276
00:15:20.871 --> 00:15:23.150
students and lawmakers were rounded up when the sun,

277
00:15:23.290 --> 00:15:27.550
it was a country where radios were broadcasting, only static TVs were blank.

278
00:15:27.730 --> 00:15:31.260
All airline traffic had been suspended and it was impossible to place an

279
00:15:31.261 --> 00:15:35.420
international call. The silence continued until 3:00 PM fueling wild dreamers.

280
00:15:35.421 --> 00:15:35.840
Finally,

281
00:15:35.840 --> 00:15:38.820
it was broken by a te announcement that the president would make a speech at

282
00:15:38.821 --> 00:15:42.580
7:00 PM that evening families gathered around their TV sets all day long.

283
00:15:42.580 --> 00:15:46.380
Foreigners had been arrested and local intellectuals disappeared by now.

284
00:15:46.700 --> 00:15:49.500
Everyone could guess what was going on and their suspicions were finally

285
00:15:49.530 --> 00:15:52.210
confirmed at seven 15 on the nation screens,

286
00:15:52.490 --> 00:15:56.450
president Marco solely informed viewers that Marshall law had been imposed was

287
00:15:56.451 --> 00:15:59.730
the end of the Philippines. As a democracy over the coming months,

288
00:15:59.920 --> 00:16:00.810
laws would be written,

289
00:16:00.811 --> 00:16:04.290
removing checks and balances and concentrating power in the hands of Marcos.

290
00:16:04.291 --> 00:16:08.530
70,000 would be jailed without trial for political crimes with another 35 to

291
00:16:08.531 --> 00:16:11.970
40,000 torture. Over 3,250 people would be execut.

292
00:16:13.360 --> 00:16:17.040
77% of whom had their corpses mutilated and dumped on the streets as a warning

293
00:16:17.100 --> 00:16:20.440
to others. From this point on, there would be no justice in the land.

294
00:16:20.690 --> 00:16:24.880
There would be no law. There would only be third and Marcos

295
00:16:31.240 --> 00:16:33.910
At first. Incredible as it seems, martial law was pretty popular.

296
00:16:34.090 --> 00:16:38.310
Things have been so chaotic that many welcomes the stability violence street

297
00:16:38.311 --> 00:16:40.510
crime was reduced. Illegal guns were seized.

298
00:16:40.570 --> 00:16:44.790
The military expanded to fight the communists nor did Marco just focus on law

299
00:16:44.910 --> 00:16:45.100
and order.

300
00:16:45.100 --> 00:16:49.030
When the new 1973 constitution was promulgated creating the post of prime

301
00:16:49.190 --> 00:16:52.310
minister and giving it to mark O while still allowing him to be president.

302
00:16:52.650 --> 00:16:54.420
The who'd just killed democracy,

303
00:16:54.690 --> 00:16:57.420
gave a speech rallying against poverty in his nation.

304
00:16:57.600 --> 00:17:01.300
But while the new society stated aim was to help the poor in reality,

305
00:17:01.700 --> 00:17:03.500
Marco mainly just helped himself.

306
00:17:03.590 --> 00:17:05.580
Successful companies were snatched from their owners,

307
00:17:05.581 --> 00:17:09.140
turned over to Mel's family members use as their private piggy bags,

308
00:17:09.520 --> 00:17:10.860
knowns crony capitalism.

309
00:17:10.930 --> 00:17:15.050
This handling of assets over to friends would call was a gigantic economic

310
00:17:15.051 --> 00:17:16.130
problem down the road,

311
00:17:16.310 --> 00:17:19.770
but not before the first family made themselves filthy rich.

312
00:17:20.000 --> 00:17:21.250
Over the years of Marshall law,

313
00:17:21.251 --> 00:17:25.250
the Mars estimated to have stolen 5 billion from the public purse.

314
00:17:25.540 --> 00:17:29.690
50 private villas were built with the couple ranging in luxury from extravagant

315
00:17:29.710 --> 00:17:33.930
to would make the Salton of Brunai blush up in St.

316
00:17:34.010 --> 00:17:35.240
North a palace was built,

317
00:17:35.480 --> 00:17:39.280
designed to rival the president's official Mahan and residents in a elder's home

318
00:17:39.440 --> 00:17:42.200
of laid the couple commissions, a 13 bedroom Villa,

319
00:17:42.201 --> 00:17:46.160
each room decorated with grands Fresco's depicting scenes from elder's life in

320
00:17:46.560 --> 00:17:51.200
tacky detail that children too reaped crony capitalism's rewards IMY and bong

321
00:17:51.400 --> 00:17:54.800
were sent abroad to expensive schools with Emmy being gifted an entire 18th

322
00:17:54.801 --> 00:17:58.400
century country estate to live in while studying Princeton, bong,

323
00:17:58.401 --> 00:18:02.920
meanwhile arranged to have the military evict 120 poor Fisher families from an

324
00:18:02.921 --> 00:18:03.400
island.

325
00:18:03.400 --> 00:18:06.160
And just so it could be filled with exotic animals and turned into his private

326
00:18:06.161 --> 00:18:06.990
hunting ground.

327
00:18:06.990 --> 00:18:10.870
This was an era when around or million Filipino children were so poor that they

328
00:18:10.871 --> 00:18:12.470
couldn't even afford school. Yet.

329
00:18:12.830 --> 00:18:16.470
Here was a meld using the state budget to buy a thousand pairs of designer shoes

330
00:18:16.530 --> 00:18:19.390
and literal suitcases stuffed full of jewels,

331
00:18:19.870 --> 00:18:23.310
not the Marcos didn't reinvest at least some of his plundered loot in Manila,

332
00:18:23.340 --> 00:18:25.070
huge sums of misappropriated cash,

333
00:18:25.310 --> 00:18:27.990
where used to build world class specialized hospitals.

334
00:18:27.991 --> 00:18:32.220
Many of these came out almost like hotels with things like upright pianos to

335
00:18:32.290 --> 00:18:36.380
entertain patients. The trouble was these specialists centers targeted,

336
00:18:36.700 --> 00:18:40.940
only diseases that Marco was interested in or which were fashionable to treat,

337
00:18:40.941 --> 00:18:44.420
which is how Manila wounds up with an expensive lung center that saw a handful

338
00:18:44.440 --> 00:18:47.180
of patients every year, while across the city, much more needed.

339
00:18:47.181 --> 00:18:50.650
Tuberculosis hospitals were so starved of cash that patients were forced to

340
00:18:50.890 --> 00:18:51.930
share beds. Still.

341
00:18:51.931 --> 00:18:55.450
The regime did at least bring in land reform laws that allowed some peasants to

342
00:18:55.451 --> 00:18:57.290
own their own small holdings for the first time.

343
00:18:57.570 --> 00:19:01.330
Yet even this was overshadowed by a drop in real wages and an economy that soon

344
00:19:01.331 --> 00:19:04.970
began to sag beneath the weight of the first couples, cronies, mismanaging,

345
00:19:05.170 --> 00:19:05.990
multiple companies,

346
00:19:05.990 --> 00:19:10.480
but perhaps the most damning facts is that the dictatorship failed on its terms.

347
00:19:10.960 --> 00:19:13.920
Marshall law was justified as a way of fighting the fledgling communist

348
00:19:13.930 --> 00:19:17.240
insurgency by the 1980s though, that insurgency hadn't just grown.

349
00:19:17.241 --> 00:19:21.160
It had been joined by a Muslim separatist rebellion in the south. In fact,

350
00:19:21.340 --> 00:19:25.120
the only thing the death of democracy seemed to have achieved was making further

351
00:19:25.440 --> 00:19:27.800
and Marko filthy rich. Unfortunately for the dictator,

352
00:19:27.940 --> 00:19:30.480
it wouldn't be long before the rest of the population realized what,

353
00:19:30.750 --> 00:19:33.270
what a crappy deal. This actually was

354
00:19:39.610 --> 00:19:41.390
On August the 21st, 1983,

355
00:19:42.030 --> 00:19:44.470
Nino Aquino stepped down off the plane at Manila airport.

356
00:19:44.471 --> 00:19:45.710
Certain that his time had come.

357
00:19:45.730 --> 00:19:48.790
It was now a decade since it'd been arrested by Marcus' goons,

358
00:19:48.950 --> 00:19:50.910
a decade in which it end endured imprisonment,

359
00:19:51.260 --> 00:19:53.700
a suspended death sentence and eventual exile.

360
00:19:53.880 --> 00:19:57.300
Now with the economy in shambles and rumors swirling about the dictators health,

361
00:19:57.320 --> 00:20:00.980
the former Senator had returned to the Philippines to fight the democracy on his

362
00:20:00.981 --> 00:20:02.420
own turf. Sadly,

363
00:20:02.421 --> 00:20:05.420
he'd never get the chance as meningo Aquino stepped off the plane,

364
00:20:05.580 --> 00:20:08.980
a gunshot rang out the senators had jerked back blood splatted.

365
00:20:09.160 --> 00:20:11.260
It was the last assassination of the Marco era,

366
00:20:11.380 --> 00:20:13.410
a another in a long line of bodies.

367
00:20:13.710 --> 00:20:17.050
But this time murder would've consequences by the time of Nino's death,

368
00:20:17.690 --> 00:20:21.050
Marcus' grip on powers loosening after an intense campaign by Catholic leaders,

369
00:20:21.410 --> 00:20:24.450
Marshall law had been lifted in 1981 ahead of a visit by the Pope.

370
00:20:24.510 --> 00:20:28.050
But Marco had refused to step down sure that his international bag as would

371
00:20:28.210 --> 00:20:31.090
continue to support him as they always had with the assassination of Nino

372
00:20:31.330 --> 00:20:34.440
though, things were are about to change. Now. So far in this video call,

373
00:20:34.441 --> 00:20:39.400
Sam has been kind of hovering in the backgrounds like a star Spangled ghost ever

374
00:20:39.401 --> 00:20:40.840
since the days of Lin B Johnson,

375
00:20:40.841 --> 00:20:44.080
Washington had poured money into keeping the Marco regime of flowed.

376
00:20:44.081 --> 00:20:46.360
Certain he was a bull work against communism,

377
00:20:46.540 --> 00:20:48.880
but with a keynote dead and millions protesting,

378
00:20:48.881 --> 00:20:52.480
uncle Sam suddenly began to wonder why he was wasting his time on this tin pot

379
00:20:52.760 --> 00:20:54.360
tyrant. When, whether this go back to Marcus,

380
00:20:54.540 --> 00:20:58.040
he decided to act to show his foreign benefactor that his people still loved

381
00:20:58.041 --> 00:20:59.120
him. In 1985,

382
00:20:59.121 --> 00:21:02.720
the dictator calls an early election fully intended to take the results and rub

383
00:21:02.721 --> 00:21:05.360
them in Ronald Reagan's face. Instead,

384
00:21:05.680 --> 00:21:09.470
Marcus wound up pressing the self destruct button on his own career.

385
00:21:09.570 --> 00:21:13.870
The oppositions candidate was Nino's widow, the popular Corra on Aquino.

386
00:21:14.050 --> 00:21:14.431
In fact,

387
00:21:14.431 --> 00:21:17.470
she was so popular that when the official results showed a Marcus landslide,

388
00:21:17.471 --> 00:21:18.670
people refused to believe them.

389
00:21:18.671 --> 00:21:21.310
They attended Coron victory rally in their millions,

390
00:21:21.370 --> 00:21:25.350
heated her call to start a campaign of civil obedience. In the end,

391
00:21:25.410 --> 00:21:28.820
the campaign would take barely two weeks to achieve its goal on February the

392
00:21:29.220 --> 00:21:31.220
22nd, 1986 Marcus' old ally,

393
00:21:31.420 --> 00:21:35.900
Juan Ponson relay abruptly threw his lot in with cor on declaring that the

394
00:21:35.901 --> 00:21:39.340
ambush on his car that had triggered the Marshall law had been staged on relay,

395
00:21:39.350 --> 00:21:43.100
joins the army deputy chief of staff and calling for a co before barricading

396
00:21:43.101 --> 00:21:46.300
himself in a military base. When the army was sent to retake it,

397
00:21:46.500 --> 00:21:49.250
Filipinos poured into streets, forming a vast human shields,

398
00:21:49.251 --> 00:21:53.130
unable to crush the trader without killing thousands, Marcos retreated.

399
00:21:53.190 --> 00:21:56.850
It was effectively the end of his dictatorship by February the 25th protests

400
00:21:57.050 --> 00:21:59.770
have paralyzed the country sensing which way the wind was blowing.

401
00:21:59.771 --> 00:22:01.490
The Americans withdrew their support for Marco.

402
00:22:01.710 --> 00:22:05.330
The dictator was told that he could accept Uson evacuation and exile.

403
00:22:05.331 --> 00:22:07.410
Lord take his chances just hours earlier,

404
00:22:07.730 --> 00:22:11.520
Marcus delivered a speech vowing to remain in power for another six years. Now,

405
00:22:11.620 --> 00:22:15.280
he was forced to swallow his pride and accept the offer that same night,

406
00:22:15.300 --> 00:22:18.840
the NAX president elder and their kids were airlifted out Manila.

407
00:22:18.950 --> 00:22:21.440
They took with the millions of dollars en Lood goods,

408
00:22:21.850 --> 00:22:23.920
final screw you to their countrymen,

409
00:22:23.980 --> 00:22:27.800
but it would be the last wound Marcos would ever inflict on the Philippines.

410
00:22:28.360 --> 00:22:33.230
Virgin Marco died three years later in exile in Hawaii on September the 28th,

411
00:22:33.670 --> 00:22:35.590
1989. At the moment of his death,

412
00:22:35.591 --> 00:22:39.830
he was facing federal charges of racketeering back home. His name was mud tar,

413
00:22:39.930 --> 00:22:41.990
not just buying the assassination and revolution,

414
00:22:42.050 --> 00:22:45.310
but by revelations of all the money that he and ADA pelt,

415
00:22:45.530 --> 00:22:50.500
it was a deserved one which doubtless left the former Dick to feeling extremely

416
00:22:50.820 --> 00:22:55.220
embedded. Yes, it wasn't quite the end today. Some 30 years after his death.

417
00:22:55.500 --> 00:22:58.460
Third end, Marco is having an unlikely rehabilitation.

418
00:22:58.820 --> 00:23:02.900
Karen Philippine president Rodrigo Duerte has openly embraced the strong man's

419
00:23:02.901 --> 00:23:06.900
memory in 2016, even allowed Marco to be buried in the cemetery of heroes.

420
00:23:07.100 --> 00:23:11.330
The Philippines equivalent of Arlington in elder is still alive and still adored

421
00:23:11.350 --> 00:23:14.570
by millions. Emmy is a Senator while in 2016,

422
00:23:15.170 --> 00:23:18.730
bong came within a he breadth of winning the vice presidency. Meanwhile,

423
00:23:18.790 --> 00:23:22.450
the new generation born after the return of democracy are beginning to express

424
00:23:22.640 --> 00:23:27.250
nostalgia for Marshall law for a time when so many believe the streets were

425
00:23:27.520 --> 00:23:29.970
safe and order reigned it's remark,

426
00:23:30.100 --> 00:23:33.880
or Postmus comeback for a dictator deposed in a revolution,

427
00:23:33.970 --> 00:23:36.800
especially one. So flagrantly corrupt,

428
00:23:37.220 --> 00:23:41.200
but then that's just Virgin and mark us all over throughout his life.

429
00:23:41.201 --> 00:23:46.200
This was a man blessed with the devil's LA someone who managed to literally get

430
00:23:46.270 --> 00:23:50.920
away with murder with war profiteering, with crushing descent for two decades,

431
00:23:51.680 --> 00:23:54.600
wherever he is now up in heaven or in the depths of hell.

432
00:23:54.790 --> 00:23:59.480
There's no doubt he's looking down on his recent rehabilitation and laughing.

433
00:24:02.580 --> 00:24:04.360
So I really hope he found that video. Interesting. If he,
