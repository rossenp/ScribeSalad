6
00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:26.510
Venezuela. What do you think of when you hear that name?

7
00:00:26.520 --> 00:00:30.390
We're guessing it something along the lines of crime, economic collapse,

8
00:00:30.770 --> 00:00:31.630
and more crime,

9
00:00:31.910 --> 00:00:35.870
a pen Petro dictatorship long rules by the United socialist party.

10
00:00:36.470 --> 00:00:40.830
Venezuela has become a by word for a failing state yet not so long.

11
00:00:41.320 --> 00:00:45.860
<v 7>It was a rich, robust democracy. That was the envy of Latin America.</v>

12
00:00:46.360 --> 00:00:51.020
So how did we go from rich past to current crisis?

13
00:00:51.450 --> 00:00:54.900
What was the bridge connecting these diametrically opposed?

14
00:00:54.901 --> 00:00:57.180
Visions of Venezuela. The answer,

15
00:00:57.880 --> 00:01:01.340
the larger than life personality of a single man,

16
00:01:02.040 --> 00:01:06.530
Hugo Chavez was a once in a generation politician coming to power as a populist

17
00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:09.170
outsider, running against, out of touch elites.

18
00:01:09.230 --> 00:01:12.450
He managed to oversee a wholesale reform of Venezuela,

19
00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:16.250
refashioning it in his own bombastic image. As president,

20
00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:21.050
he instituted unprecedented spending gay freely to the poor halved poverty rates

21
00:01:21.190 --> 00:01:24.200
and reduced mortality. At the same time though,

22
00:01:24.300 --> 00:01:29.240
he turned what was once a functioning democracy into an autocratic vanity

23
00:01:29.241 --> 00:01:33.160
project. One that was doomed to failure, a Robin hood to some,

24
00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:38.560
a classic Latin American dictator to others. This is the life of Hugo Chavez.

25
00:01:38.900 --> 00:01:41.440
The man who made modern Venezuela.

26
00:01:48.010 --> 00:01:51.350
<v 0>If you were inventing the background story for a socialist revolutionary,</v>

27
00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:56.190
you'd be hard pressed to come up with anything better than Hugo Chavez's actual

28
00:01:56.500 --> 00:02:01.190
life born on the 28th of July, 1954 Chavez was the real deal,

29
00:02:01.430 --> 00:02:05.820
a dirt poor kid in a house with a literal dirt floor.

30
00:02:06.120 --> 00:02:08.060
Not that CHMA has grew up there at a young age.

31
00:02:08.120 --> 00:02:11.180
He and his older brother Arean were sent to live with their grandmother.

32
00:02:11.181 --> 00:02:14.700
When it became apparent that their teacher parents couldn't afford to feed them

33
00:02:14.790 --> 00:02:18.780
still. That doesn't mean Chavez's early. Life was all hard knocks and misery.

34
00:02:18.920 --> 00:02:19.461
As a boy,

35
00:02:19.461 --> 00:02:23.500
he was semi-famous around the outskirts of Barrs small city on the edge of

36
00:02:23.810 --> 00:02:27.410
Venezuela's vast grasslands for his ability to play baseball.

37
00:02:27.480 --> 00:02:31.090
This was the era of guys like nester Lago Chavez,

38
00:02:31.990 --> 00:02:36.250
the Venezuelan pitcher who made it all the way to the San Francisco giants and

39
00:02:36.560 --> 00:02:39.090
Hugo was determined to follow in his footsteps,

40
00:02:39.150 --> 00:02:43.170
but baseball wasn't the only influence floating around BES. At that time,

41
00:02:43.230 --> 00:02:45.560
during the 1960s and seventies,

42
00:02:45.760 --> 00:02:49.280
Venezuela had to deal with a handful of communist insurgencies.

43
00:02:49.330 --> 00:02:53.280
While these orange groups weren't a patch on Columbia's park or Peru shining

44
00:02:53.310 --> 00:02:55.400
path, they were still a fact of life.

45
00:02:55.740 --> 00:02:59.800
It said that the teenage Chavez was intrigued by the gorillas who roams the

46
00:02:59.801 --> 00:03:04.800
nearby countryside, even going so far as to read the works of Karl marks still,

47
00:03:04.910 --> 00:03:09.200
that was all just background to his current love affair. With baseball age,

48
00:03:09.600 --> 00:03:14.040
17 Chavez left BARR essences enrolled the military academy in Caracas,

49
00:03:14.440 --> 00:03:17.280
hit her there, the best baseball coaches and plans to train up,

50
00:03:17.281 --> 00:03:20.150
then drop out as soon as he was good enough to play in the leagues.

51
00:03:20.490 --> 00:03:22.990
But while his pitching might have been good for barriers,

52
00:03:23.010 --> 00:03:25.950
it wasn't good enough for Caracas. At some point,

53
00:03:25.970 --> 00:03:29.590
the young boy from the depo home was forced to abandon his baseball dreams.

54
00:03:29.970 --> 00:03:33.630
And that was how Hugo Chavez found himself stuck on a military track.

55
00:03:33.770 --> 00:03:37.790
He had no interest in following with a yearning fame that could never be

56
00:03:37.791 --> 00:03:38.450
fulfilled.

57
00:03:38.450 --> 00:03:43.340
He graduat hated in 1975 at the bottom of his class immediately after he

58
00:03:43.350 --> 00:03:47.700
joins the army and was packed after fighter MAED surgeon group in rural Anne

59
00:03:48.340 --> 00:03:52.940
Swee to say this was depressing would be like saying Shula's list is a

60
00:03:53.040 --> 00:03:56.340
joyful, sad shears, hated his time in the army.

61
00:03:56.560 --> 00:03:58.180
He hated being in the middle of nowhere.

62
00:03:58.440 --> 00:04:01.970
He hated the gorillas and he hated the human rights abuses.

63
00:04:01.990 --> 00:04:04.410
His unit committed come 1977.

64
00:04:04.630 --> 00:04:07.850
He felt he had more in common with the gorillas than the army.

65
00:04:08.070 --> 00:04:09.650
And he was on the verge of quitting.

66
00:04:09.680 --> 00:04:13.210
When his older brother dropped an unexpected bombshell by now,

67
00:04:13.730 --> 00:04:15.810
AAN was a radical university professor,

68
00:04:15.870 --> 00:04:19.650
but no one had realized quite how radical in secret.

69
00:04:20.400 --> 00:04:22.760
Ian had been building links with the communist and surgeons.

70
00:04:22.830 --> 00:04:24.640
When he heard about his brothers worries,

71
00:04:24.641 --> 00:04:28.280
he offered to arrange a meeting not long after hug go Chavez.

72
00:04:28.390 --> 00:04:32.480
Finally met Douglas Bravo despite having a name that sounds like military code

73
00:04:32.481 --> 00:04:35.880
for the letters D and B Douglas Bravo was in reality,

74
00:04:36.040 --> 00:04:40.480
a former gorilla now preaching the use of Venezuela's oil wealth to build a

75
00:04:40.950 --> 00:04:44.350
socialist utopia together. He and Chavez formed the Bavarian movement.

76
00:04:44.370 --> 00:04:48.550
200 secret cell within the military dedicated to overthrowing the government

77
00:04:48.740 --> 00:04:53.510
when the time came. Luckily for them that time was just around the corner.

78
00:04:59.840 --> 00:05:02.700
We're gonna pause an and take a quick history lesson. Now,

79
00:05:02.701 --> 00:05:07.500
one that will hopefully explain why a failed baseball player succeeded at taking

80
00:05:07.501 --> 00:05:11.340
over Venezuela to do that. We need to focus on two vital things in the country,

81
00:05:11.620 --> 00:05:13.100
politics and oil.

82
00:05:13.360 --> 00:05:17.340
The discovery of black gold in Venezuela took place in 1922.

83
00:05:17.900 --> 00:05:21.420
That year a well in the America IBO basin suddenly began to gush a hundred

84
00:05:21.570 --> 00:05:23.130
hundred thousand barrels a day.

85
00:05:23.390 --> 00:05:26.610
It was the start of a process that would eventually lead to Venezuela.

86
00:05:26.710 --> 00:05:30.370
Having the largest proven oil reserves on earth.

87
00:05:30.550 --> 00:05:34.010
It was also the start of a dangerously lopsided economy.

88
00:05:34.310 --> 00:05:38.210
The damage really began in 1943. When the military rulers signed a law,

89
00:05:38.211 --> 00:05:42.840
forcing all foreign oil companies to hand over a huge of their profits.

90
00:05:43.060 --> 00:05:47.040
The revenue this generated was so vast that the government felt no need to

91
00:05:47.041 --> 00:05:48.880
further diversify the economy.

92
00:05:49.100 --> 00:05:52.560
And that would leave Venezuela very vulnerable to price fluctuations in oil,

93
00:05:52.820 --> 00:05:56.520
but a Petro economy alone does not make an unstable state.

94
00:05:57.160 --> 00:06:01.840
No that took both oil mania and some very unwise decisions taken at the top

95
00:06:02.020 --> 00:06:02.920
in 1958,

96
00:06:02.921 --> 00:06:07.120
opposition leader Romulo betting court became president's ending military rule

97
00:06:07.210 --> 00:06:09.240
known as the father of Venezuelan democracy.

98
00:06:09.720 --> 00:06:11.120
Betting Inor had a lot going for him,

99
00:06:11.520 --> 00:06:15.920
but he was also operating in a time when Latin America was very unstable across

100
00:06:15.921 --> 00:06:20.030
the border. Columbia was just emerging from something known as Lavia Valencia,

101
00:06:20.390 --> 00:06:23.790
a decade of undeclared civil war between the liberal and conservative parties

102
00:06:23.860 --> 00:06:28.230
that had killed over 150,000 needing to keep Venezuela's parties from each

103
00:06:28.550 --> 00:06:32.310
other's throats, Bedor established the Punte, a GMO power sharing, packed,

104
00:06:32.311 --> 00:06:34.750
keeping the main parties perpetually in office.

105
00:06:35.130 --> 00:06:38.300
The Punte a GMO was great in that it led to stability,

106
00:06:38.400 --> 00:06:43.180
but less great in that it concentrated all power in the hands of a very

107
00:06:43.181 --> 00:06:47.500
narrow Europeanized elite belonging to one of two parties.

108
00:06:48.040 --> 00:06:50.020
As a result, if things ever went wrong,

109
00:06:50.200 --> 00:06:52.780
the people would know exactly who to blame.

110
00:06:53.040 --> 00:06:55.460
The good times reached their peak in the 1970s.

111
00:06:55.461 --> 00:06:59.850
After the Arab oil embargo led to a surge demand for Venezuelan crude in

112
00:07:00.010 --> 00:07:04.090
1975, then president Carlos, Andrea Perez, nationalized oil production.

113
00:07:04.270 --> 00:07:07.610
And it seems as if the money would never stop rolling in,

114
00:07:07.830 --> 00:07:10.770
but that's the trouble with a non diversified economy.

115
00:07:10.910 --> 00:07:15.850
All it takes is a single black Swan events and everything can come crashing

116
00:07:15.851 --> 00:07:17.970
down. Fittingly Venezuela's blacks.

117
00:07:18.100 --> 00:07:21.600
One took the form of oil prices in 1981,

118
00:07:21.640 --> 00:07:24.480
a so-called oil glut caused a global price crash,

119
00:07:24.670 --> 00:07:28.760
this kneecap to the Venezuelan economy. But by 1989, the country was in crisis.

120
00:07:28.910 --> 00:07:32.720
President Perez took a loan from the IMF promising to end food and fuel

121
00:07:32.721 --> 00:07:37.080
subsidies as a precondition it's at this point that the other bird came home to

122
00:07:37.400 --> 00:07:42.350
roo thanks to the pun VI GSMO Venezuela's elites were now so totally removed

123
00:07:42.351 --> 00:07:46.750
from their struggling countrymen that they didn't realize they needed the food

124
00:07:46.751 --> 00:07:51.350
subsidies to survive. So when the government suddenly took those subsidies away,

125
00:07:52.190 --> 00:07:55.310
well, let's just say that the masses didn't take kindly to it.

126
00:07:55.450 --> 00:07:57.990
The Cara Caso erupted on February the 27th,

127
00:07:58.470 --> 00:08:03.100
1989 in a week long orgy of rot in Caracas. It devastated the city.

128
00:08:03.460 --> 00:08:05.860
Although the government managed to retake the streets, they did.

129
00:08:05.920 --> 00:08:10.140
So at a great cost by one estimate security forces killed around 3000.

130
00:08:10.700 --> 00:08:11.740
Ratts in the aftermath.

131
00:08:11.940 --> 00:08:16.620
A huge anger began to swell against the elites against the punt of GSMO in the

132
00:08:16.820 --> 00:08:19.380
military. This anger found an outlet from that year,

133
00:08:19.760 --> 00:08:23.530
Hugo Chave and Douglas Bravo had no problem recruiting soldiers into their

134
00:08:23.531 --> 00:08:26.370
revolutionary sell. By the time the nineties got underway,

135
00:08:26.680 --> 00:08:28.250
they had their own private army

136
00:08:34.710 --> 00:08:36.290
On February the fourth, 1992,

137
00:08:36.291 --> 00:08:40.840
regular broadcasts on Venezuelan TV were interrupted by breaking news report.

138
00:08:41.040 --> 00:08:44.760
A military co was underway as tanks rolled up the streets of the presidential

139
00:08:44.761 --> 00:08:46.840
palace stories poured in of armed units,

140
00:08:46.870 --> 00:08:50.920
seizing the cities of Mar IBO and Valencia. For a moment,

141
00:08:51.060 --> 00:08:54.880
it really looks like the plotters would take power, but only for a moment.

142
00:08:55.190 --> 00:08:57.640
Somehow president Perez managed to escape capture.

143
00:08:57.820 --> 00:09:01.360
He went on TV and called for people to defy the plotters.

144
00:09:01.470 --> 00:09:03.560
Shortly after the tanks stopped their assaults.

145
00:09:03.620 --> 00:09:06.640
The leader of the co cuts deal to stand down provided.

146
00:09:06.641 --> 00:09:10.440
He was allowed to go on live TV and ask his followers to lay down their arms.

147
00:09:10.830 --> 00:09:14.320
That very nice Venezuela got its first glimpse of hug go.

148
00:09:15.020 --> 00:09:19.230
Despite having just led a failed CU Chavez seemed calm before the cameras even

149
00:09:19.290 --> 00:09:21.350
amused in a short speech, he declared

150
00:09:29.730 --> 00:09:33.990
The key words there were for now or a horror in Spanish

151
00:09:34.330 --> 00:09:35.980
coming this confidence officer,

152
00:09:36.280 --> 00:09:39.860
the soldier who looks not like the European eyes deletes,

153
00:09:39.880 --> 00:09:42.580
but like the mixed heritage mass of Venezuelans.

154
00:09:42.830 --> 00:09:45.340
Those two words did not sound empty.

155
00:09:45.450 --> 00:09:49.820
They actually sounded like a promise in the aftermath of the coup Chavez was

156
00:09:49.980 --> 00:09:51.700
thrown in prison, but he wouldn't be there long.

157
00:09:51.880 --> 00:09:55.460
The coup attempts had come a time when memories of the car car,

158
00:09:55.530 --> 00:09:56.490
as they were still fresh.

159
00:09:56.520 --> 00:09:59.570
When the ruling classes were trusted about as much as your trust,

160
00:09:59.690 --> 00:10:04.170
a babysitting service run by Jared Fogal inves Venezuelans,

161
00:10:04.171 --> 00:10:08.850
didn't see a Renegade army officer. They saw a hope for their future. Next year,

162
00:10:09.090 --> 00:10:12.610
1993, president Barez was impeached for embezzlements and removed from office.

163
00:10:13.040 --> 00:10:15.810
When Rafa Aldera took office in 1990,

164
00:10:16.340 --> 00:10:19.840
he issued a blanket pardon to the co plotters on Israeli.

165
00:10:20.400 --> 00:10:21.320
Shez became a celebrity.

166
00:10:21.320 --> 00:10:26.240
The soldier who'd taken a stand against corrupt Perez during a 100 day

167
00:10:26.440 --> 00:10:27.020
tour. Venezuela,

168
00:10:27.020 --> 00:10:30.760
the former plotter met thousands of ordinary people and everywhere he went,

169
00:10:30.980 --> 00:10:35.160
he took his promise. Poor a horror things were bad,

170
00:10:35.500 --> 00:10:38.430
but only for now. He seemed to be saying, trust me,

171
00:10:38.810 --> 00:10:40.630
new possibilities will arise again.

172
00:10:41.170 --> 00:10:45.350
By the time the 1998 elections rolled around Chavez was the most popular man in

173
00:10:45.351 --> 00:10:48.470
the country. Founding a party known as the movement of the fifth Republic.

174
00:10:48.850 --> 00:10:51.270
He ran for presidents and it was perfect timing.

175
00:10:51.950 --> 00:10:54.070
Chavez painted himself as someone neither left nor right.

176
00:10:54.071 --> 00:10:58.540
Simply an outsider who would drain the swamping car and shake up the

177
00:10:59.100 --> 00:11:01.900
Mons two party system that ignored ordinary voters.

178
00:11:02.360 --> 00:11:04.700
The establishment played right into his hands,

179
00:11:04.701 --> 00:11:09.260
putting up a foreign educated candidate who might as well have campaigned from a

180
00:11:09.261 --> 00:11:14.260
literal ivory tower. The results were unambiguous on December the sixth,

181
00:11:14.580 --> 00:11:15.413
1998.

182
00:11:15.700 --> 00:11:20.530
Chavez won the presidency carrying 56% of the vote on February the second, 1999.

183
00:11:20.531 --> 00:11:23.250
He was inaugurated on a platform of sweeping change.

184
00:11:23.750 --> 00:11:27.970
The triumph of the failed baseball star had dreamed of when he launched his coup

185
00:11:27.971 --> 00:11:32.450
just seven years earlier was finally here. Poor horror was gone.

186
00:11:32.790 --> 00:11:34.370
It was Mely a horror.

187
00:11:35.110 --> 00:11:39.800
The time was now no one watching Chavez's nor ion on TV could have guessed it.

188
00:11:39.820 --> 00:11:42.600
But a historic moment had just taken place.

189
00:11:42.830 --> 00:11:46.320
When Hugo Chavez finally left office in the back of a hears,

190
00:11:46.620 --> 00:11:49.680
he would leave behind a country that had changed forever.

191
00:11:50.020 --> 00:11:53.600
Now you might not have to worry about someone plotting a cue against you,

192
00:11:53.960 --> 00:11:56.920
but you might have to worry about people stealing your data online. Look,

193
00:11:56.921 --> 00:12:00.440
if you are buying things online and you're not in a secure wifi spot,

194
00:12:00.540 --> 00:12:02.000
you really should be using a VPN.

195
00:12:02.060 --> 00:12:05.080
And that's where today's sponsor Nord VPN comes in.

196
00:12:05.080 --> 00:12:08.760
Now I know it's tempting not to bother just sort of hope for the best,

197
00:12:09.100 --> 00:12:12.440
but really those stories you hear about online, about people having the,

198
00:12:12.590 --> 00:12:17.070
a data stone and they really do happen and you don't wanna make it easy for that

199
00:12:17.071 --> 00:12:19.750
to happen to you whenever I'm browsing on unsecured wifi,

200
00:12:20.110 --> 00:12:22.270
I just keep a VPN on in the backgrounds all the time.

201
00:12:22.271 --> 00:12:25.350
So I don't have to worry about anyone stealing my data,

202
00:12:25.530 --> 00:12:27.150
but it's not just about security.

203
00:12:27.151 --> 00:12:29.950
You can also use it to change the country you appear to be in.

204
00:12:29.970 --> 00:12:34.380
So you can get content that might normally only be available in specific

205
00:12:34.381 --> 00:12:37.740
geographic locations. Nord VPNs also super fast.

206
00:12:37.880 --> 00:12:41.060
So watching a video is a breeze. There's no lag whatsoever.

207
00:12:41.240 --> 00:12:44.340
If you've ever thought VPNs were slow. Well,

208
00:12:44.600 --> 00:12:48.540
that's not the case with Nord VPN and you can use it on all of your devices.

209
00:12:48.541 --> 00:12:51.180
Very easily, Android Chrome windows, Linux,

210
00:12:51.200 --> 00:12:55.250
and on six different devices with just one account. Also,

211
00:12:55.251 --> 00:12:56.690
there are no logs kept at all.

212
00:12:56.691 --> 00:13:00.610
Unlike companies based in the EU or the us nor VPN is over in Panama.

213
00:13:00.870 --> 00:13:02.570
So they just don't have to keep any logs,

214
00:13:02.571 --> 00:13:04.650
which is obviously great for your privacy.

215
00:13:05.530 --> 00:13:08.490
Start protecting your internet experience today, go to Nord,

216
00:13:08.550 --> 00:13:12.930

218
00:13:17.870 --> 00:13:21.800
protect yourself online today. And let's get back to it.

219
00:13:28.400 --> 00:13:29.060
When Chaz took office,

220
00:13:29.060 --> 00:13:33.160
he was more popular than any of today's populist could dream of being across

221
00:13:33.480 --> 00:13:37.990
1999 as approved of rating hovered around a staggering 80%.

222
00:13:38.130 --> 00:13:41.430
He was helped by Aran of reforms, including planned Boulevard,

223
00:13:41.431 --> 00:13:46.030
2000 a kind of Venezuela new deal that poured money into infrastructure spending

224
00:13:46.270 --> 00:13:47.510
and building affordable homes.

225
00:13:47.810 --> 00:13:52.030
But this populism masked deeper machinations as president

226
00:13:52.870 --> 00:13:52.871
Chavez,

227
00:13:52.871 --> 00:13:56.740
was able to call a referen and Monterey writing the constitution with people

228
00:13:56.750 --> 00:13:58.620
still at Venezuela's elites.

229
00:13:58.720 --> 00:14:03.380
He won by a wide margin in the vote deciding who would do the rewriting Chavez

230
00:14:03.381 --> 00:14:04.460
again, carried the day.

231
00:14:04.600 --> 00:14:08.540
The result was a constitution rewritten to give the president six year times and

232
00:14:08.830 --> 00:14:11.700
allow immediate reelection. It also abolished the Senate,

233
00:14:11.780 --> 00:14:15.380
enforced every elected official to run again for office in two,

234
00:14:16.370 --> 00:14:20.330
or lose their seats. When Chavez put this to referendum on the 15th of December,

235
00:14:20.790 --> 00:14:21.623
he won again.

236
00:14:21.750 --> 00:14:25.010
It was the classical political trick of ramming through major changes.

237
00:14:25.011 --> 00:14:29.170
While you still have that honeymoon glow before people start to seriously

238
00:14:29.530 --> 00:14:34.410
question your motivations. And it works when the mega election was held in July,

239
00:14:34.410 --> 00:14:39.160
2000 showers won a new year term and a new national assembly was returned

240
00:14:39.161 --> 00:14:44.000
that held a pro Chavez majority not long after the Supreme court was quietly

241
00:14:44.001 --> 00:14:47.920
stuffed with pro Chavez judges, but was Chavez was consolidating.

242
00:14:47.940 --> 00:14:52.200
His power life in Venezuela was stubbornly refusing to improve.

243
00:14:52.460 --> 00:14:55.840
In 1999, the economy had shrunk by 7%.

244
00:14:55.980 --> 00:15:00.880
The problems that had led to Chavez's own 1992 co still hadn't gone away

245
00:15:01.260 --> 00:15:02.060
and Chavez.

246
00:15:02.060 --> 00:15:05.600
Wasn't the only former officer willing to change the leadership through force

247
00:15:05.770 --> 00:15:09.920
early warning signs came in 2001 when Chavez unveiled a package of executive

248
00:15:10.400 --> 00:15:14.350
decreased designed to wildly redistribute land and wealth in Venezuela,

249
00:15:14.990 --> 00:15:17.870
that turns the business community ends the upper classes against him.

250
00:15:17.900 --> 00:15:22.510
Then he started cozying up to fed dark Castro's Cuba alienating the middle class

251
00:15:22.990 --> 00:15:25.470
come 2002 Chavez. His support was tanking.

252
00:15:25.570 --> 00:15:29.550
No one even seemed to be sure who is ruling for apart from himself.

253
00:15:29.850 --> 00:15:30.683
It was at this point,

254
00:15:31.020 --> 00:15:35.500
our president did something very stupid that year Chavez announced moves that

255
00:15:35.700 --> 00:15:39.700
we'd effectively place the state oil company under the control of his own party.

256
00:15:40.000 --> 00:15:44.580
The reaction was swift and it was violence on April the 11th million,

257
00:15:44.660 --> 00:15:47.900
a million people marched on the president's palace in Caracas to protest.

258
00:15:48.490 --> 00:15:52.810
Instead, they were met by Chavez's oil gunman who opened fire.

259
00:15:53.070 --> 00:15:54.930
It was the Cara Hasso all over again.

260
00:15:55.310 --> 00:15:58.010
And an unknown number of people died that same day.

261
00:15:58.011 --> 00:16:01.810
The military removed Hugo Chavez from power. So you're not an idiot.

262
00:16:01.950 --> 00:16:05.290
You can see that this video still has about half of its run time left.

263
00:16:05.430 --> 00:16:08.890
So the question therefore is, well, how did Hugo Chavez survive?

264
00:16:08.950 --> 00:16:13.400
The coup the answer sheer luck, the same day Chavez was arrested.

265
00:16:13.500 --> 00:16:15.080
The military installed businessman,

266
00:16:15.360 --> 00:16:18.040
Pedro Carmona as head of an interim government,

267
00:16:18.100 --> 00:16:22.080
but Carona seems to have mistaken this for a blank check and immediately

268
00:16:22.081 --> 00:16:24.960
suspended the constitution and dissolved the government in response,

269
00:16:24.961 --> 00:16:26.840
the military appears to have been like, ah, no,

270
00:16:27.310 --> 00:16:29.320
this guy's even crazier than the last guy.

271
00:16:29.630 --> 00:16:32.320
Therefore they just hit the undue button.

272
00:16:33.070 --> 00:16:35.150
Camona was himself deposed and Chavez returns.

273
00:16:35.151 --> 00:16:39.710
The president's palaces by the very army that had arrested him after Amere 47

274
00:16:39.711 --> 00:16:42.670
hours, Yugo Chavez was back in control. At first,

275
00:16:42.810 --> 00:16:47.390
he was contrite promising more compromise in the future accepting that he had

276
00:16:47.391 --> 00:16:50.150
gone too far, but this is Chavez.

277
00:16:50.350 --> 00:16:52.590
Remember the guy of P horror,

278
00:16:53.160 --> 00:16:57.740
all it learns from the 2002 co was that the time wasn't ripe to launch his

279
00:16:57.900 --> 00:17:00.860
complete takeover of the government, but when the time came,

280
00:17:01.440 --> 00:17:02.740
he would be more than ready.

281
00:17:09.280 --> 00:17:13.380
The moments the Kaku collapsed, Venezuela became a country. Bitterly divided,

282
00:17:13.630 --> 00:17:14.251
do camps.

283
00:17:14.251 --> 00:17:17.970
Those who loved Chavez and those who spat at the very mention of his name.

284
00:17:18.040 --> 00:17:20.250
Initially the second camp was biggest.

285
00:17:21.210 --> 00:17:24.010
Chavez was just too openly craving power for power's sake,

286
00:17:24.240 --> 00:17:28.010
even fired striking workers who opposed him and replaced them with non-union

287
00:17:28.020 --> 00:17:31.010
labor move way more capitalist, roaders,

288
00:17:31.370 --> 00:17:33.250
and socialist revolutionary,

289
00:17:33.430 --> 00:17:37.560
but then fi Castro had a quiet word in Chave and everything changed.

290
00:17:38.020 --> 00:17:40.680
The Bavarian missions named after independence era,

291
00:17:40.850 --> 00:17:45.760
Simon BVA were simple in their genius government bodies funded by rising all

292
00:17:45.860 --> 00:17:50.400
prices were charged with going into the slums of Caracas and improving life for

293
00:17:50.401 --> 00:17:53.600
the poor. There were adult literacy programs, free community healthcare,

294
00:17:53.601 --> 00:17:57.240
subsidized food banks, free houses for the deed tears. Well, okay.

295
00:17:57.340 --> 00:17:58.173
You might be thinking,

296
00:17:58.340 --> 00:18:01.760
but that's just the very poorest that surely can't be enough voters to keep

297
00:18:02.240 --> 00:18:06.040
Chavez in power. Right. But the thing is, yeah, there were enough of them.

298
00:18:06.480 --> 00:18:10.030
Remember the booms times under the pun over G when all that all money came

299
00:18:10.031 --> 00:18:13.870
rolling in. Well, it had only come rolling in for those at the very top.

300
00:18:14.050 --> 00:18:17.870
By the time Chavez took power, a full 50% of Venezuelans were living in poverty,

301
00:18:18.340 --> 00:18:22.430
ignored and forgotten by the elites with the Bavarian missions,

302
00:18:22.670 --> 00:18:24.310
someone was finally paying attention to them.

303
00:18:24.610 --> 00:18:28.790
And it's here that we can see one of the fascinating contradictions of Hugo

304
00:18:28.950 --> 00:18:32.700
Chave. As on the one hands, the missions, they were clearly cynical,

305
00:18:32.701 --> 00:18:37.660
organized to get masses of voters on his site. But on the other hands,

306
00:18:37.840 --> 00:18:41.540
the missions did really work. Millions were lifted out of poverty.

307
00:18:41.620 --> 00:18:45.220
Millions were given opportunities that long been denied to them.

308
00:18:45.221 --> 00:18:48.220
Imagine for a moment that you were AAC, a slum dweller,

309
00:18:48.221 --> 00:18:51.530
who'd seen her lifestyle remain resolutely third world,

310
00:18:51.560 --> 00:18:54.450
even as the elites enjoyed unparalleled luxury.

311
00:18:54.910 --> 00:18:57.250
Now imagine a government suddenly coming along,

312
00:18:57.251 --> 00:19:01.050
that gets rid of your dirt floor that can give you drinking water that can give

313
00:19:01.051 --> 00:19:04.570
your son an education, which you really refused to vote for.

314
00:19:04.730 --> 00:19:06.010
The man who gave you all of this.

315
00:19:06.190 --> 00:19:10.800
The popularity boost from the missions allows Chavez to survive a 2004 recall

316
00:19:10.801 --> 00:19:12.680
referendum by 2005,

317
00:19:12.780 --> 00:19:16.560
he was popular enough that he launched a program of land appropriations aimed at

318
00:19:16.760 --> 00:19:19.520
large estate. That same year laws were passed effectively,

319
00:19:19.521 --> 00:19:23.840
ending media freedom come 2006. The opposition was boycoting elections.

320
00:19:23.841 --> 00:19:28.480
So pro Chavez's politicians effectively won every seat going and Chavez

321
00:19:28.481 --> 00:19:33.230
himself won reelection as president Chavez's last great move that year was

322
00:19:33.231 --> 00:19:37.830
found the United socialist party of Venezuela effectively merging nearly all the

323
00:19:38.190 --> 00:19:39.990
countries left wing parties with his own.

324
00:19:40.170 --> 00:19:43.230
The president now had a strangle hold on power in Carras.

325
00:19:43.370 --> 00:19:46.230
His opponents were down the masses in love with him,

326
00:19:46.530 --> 00:19:49.550
and all voices of moderation were silenced.

327
00:19:49.770 --> 00:19:51.580
He was effectively a God,

328
00:19:51.860 --> 00:19:55.780
a man upon whose shoulders or power in his nation rested.

329
00:19:56.080 --> 00:20:00.180
And it's at this point, that things begin to get a little weird.

330
00:20:06.560 --> 00:20:08.300
One of the interesting things about Chavez,

331
00:20:08.520 --> 00:20:13.210
we can only see with hindsight is that the prefigured to days populists like

332
00:20:13.211 --> 00:20:17.090
many of those running the world now Chavez, scorned, normal media channels.

333
00:20:17.091 --> 00:20:19.890
Instead preferring to communicate directly with his followers.

334
00:20:20.190 --> 00:20:23.890
He was obsessed with touring the country, giving speeches that were rambling,

335
00:20:24.350 --> 00:20:28.010
folksy, unscripted, and often fantastically vindictive.

336
00:20:28.190 --> 00:20:32.010
He developed a way with insults once calling George W. Bush more,

337
00:20:32.280 --> 00:20:34.280
more dangerous than a monkey with a razor blade.

338
00:20:35.800 --> 00:20:38.680
<v 6>English Akey Mr. D.</v>

339
00:20:39.230 --> 00:20:40.960
<v 0>He'd dabbled in conspiracy theories,</v>

340
00:20:40.961 --> 00:20:45.400
speculating to enrapture audiences that the moon landings were faked that secret

341
00:20:45.840 --> 00:20:47.520
us super weapons caused earthquakes.

342
00:20:47.780 --> 00:20:50.960
It was a technique we're all too familiar with in the presence,

343
00:20:51.360 --> 00:20:52.600
the use of bombast and taboo,

344
00:20:52.601 --> 00:20:57.440
breaking to distract attention from the seriously evil crap that you're actually

345
00:20:57.460 --> 00:21:01.120
up to. But while today's populist S of Hugo Chavez,

346
00:21:01.121 --> 00:21:05.000
the original was just light years beyond anything. Donald Trump, Boris Johnson,

347
00:21:05.220 --> 00:21:06.830
or even Richard ago,

348
00:21:07.470 --> 00:21:11.190
Duterte could dream of by the late two thousands Chavez had so effectively

349
00:21:11.191 --> 00:21:15.030
become the focal point of Venezuelan governance that he was followed everywhere

350
00:21:15.130 --> 00:21:15.963
by cameras.

351
00:21:16.010 --> 00:21:20.870
His lust off the cuff remarks translated into instant policy as if he were some

352
00:21:20.980 --> 00:21:23.230
sort of medieval European king.

353
00:21:26.500 --> 00:21:27.220
That was,

354
00:21:27.220 --> 00:21:30.780
is the time he set the nation's clocks back half an hour on a whi more the time

355
00:21:30.781 --> 00:21:33.500
he nearly declared war on Columbia, live on air.

356
00:21:34.060 --> 00:21:35.300
We're not making laws up on the fly.

357
00:21:35.440 --> 00:21:38.260
He was launching into seven hour rents on his weekly show.

358
00:21:38.900 --> 00:21:42.820
Allo Presidente covering everything from whiskey to cosmetic surgery.

359
00:21:43.460 --> 00:21:48.330
It's tempting to think that post 2006 Chavez simply lost it so that he was Mely

360
00:21:48.331 --> 00:21:53.210
another GIA weirdo Athar who finally let his weirdness come out.

361
00:21:53.470 --> 00:21:57.490
But there is another view. One summed up by the former editor of the news site,

362
00:21:58.130 --> 00:21:59.930
Caracas Chronicles in Venezuela.

363
00:21:59.931 --> 00:22:04.450
These outbreaks of weird had a different meaning is visible displays of Chavez's

364
00:22:04.451 --> 00:22:05.284
untouchability.

365
00:22:05.360 --> 00:22:09.560
There's an inevitable creepiness to a society where the leader never pays a

366
00:22:09.561 --> 00:22:11.000
political price for what he says,

367
00:22:11.340 --> 00:22:15.840
no matter how plainly crazy or illegal it may be. In other words,

368
00:22:16.320 --> 00:22:19.280
Chavez only acted so crazy because he knew he could get away with it.

369
00:22:19.620 --> 00:22:22.600
And he wanted you to know that he could get away with it,

370
00:22:22.990 --> 00:22:26.320
despite all the outward trappings of a G Daffy star dictatorship, though,

371
00:22:26.540 --> 00:22:29.950
we should be careful to note that Chavez wasn't actually a dictator,

372
00:22:30.250 --> 00:22:33.670
at least not in the traditional sense. In his 14 years in office,

373
00:22:33.850 --> 00:22:35.190
he never once rigged an election.

374
00:22:35.490 --> 00:22:39.870
He won nearly every vote he took part in and he won it fair and square.

375
00:22:40.210 --> 00:22:42.070
On the other hand, when he did lose, he found,

376
00:22:42.400 --> 00:22:47.190
let's say creative ways around the result in 2007, for example, Chavez,

377
00:22:47.191 --> 00:22:50.460
narrowly lost a referendum on great expanding his powers.

378
00:22:50.640 --> 00:22:54.380
The next day billboards appeared around Caracas with the slogan PRA horror.

379
00:22:54.920 --> 00:22:58.940
It was a promise one that Chavez followed through on over the next three years.

380
00:22:59.120 --> 00:23:02.660
All the failed referendums provisions were passed one way or another either by

381
00:23:02.661 --> 00:23:05.900
breaking them up and holding separate referendums or by making the national

382
00:23:06.260 --> 00:23:11.090
assembly pass laws or by using executive orders by I 2010 Chavez had

383
00:23:11.091 --> 00:23:15.730
everything had asked voters for back in 2007. So yeah,

384
00:23:16.370 --> 00:23:19.490
Chavez may never have become a dictator in the literal sense,

385
00:23:19.670 --> 00:23:22.050
but nor was he a Democrat, more,

386
00:23:22.170 --> 00:23:26.490
a strong man who used democracy to do undemocratic things come

387
00:23:27.210 --> 00:23:30.280
2010 Chavez had secured the constitutional right to keep running for new you

388
00:23:30.281 --> 00:23:31.880
presidential terms indefinitely.

389
00:23:37.160 --> 00:23:38.800
Did anyone watching Venezuela at the time?

390
00:23:38.940 --> 00:23:43.800
It seems like the 56 year old Chavez could conceivably keep ruling for another

391
00:23:43.810 --> 00:23:45.480
three decades. Little.

392
00:23:45.700 --> 00:23:50.160
Did anyone know that it'd be gone in barely a 10th of that time?

393
00:23:56.420 --> 00:24:00.160
The first signs of the honor that would kill Hugo Chavez appeared in June of

394
00:24:00.161 --> 00:24:01.680
2011. That month,

395
00:24:01.960 --> 00:24:05.150
our Presidente was forced to cancel a meeting of Latin American leaders in

396
00:24:05.350 --> 00:24:07.070
flight to Cuba for emergency surgery.

397
00:24:07.590 --> 00:24:11.110
No long after he informed his public that had been diagnosed with cancer.

398
00:24:15.770 --> 00:24:16.170
At first,

399
00:24:16.170 --> 00:24:20.350
it seemed that treatments in Cuba were a success come 2012 Chavez was still

400
00:24:20.351 --> 00:24:24.350
feeling strong enough to run in presidential elections and when a third term,

401
00:24:24.530 --> 00:24:28.100
but it just a smoke screen, deep down Chavez knew what was happening.

402
00:24:28.320 --> 00:24:32.020
And he began to make preparations on October the 11th, 2012,

403
00:24:32.460 --> 00:24:34.380
Chavez abruptly appointed former bus driver,

404
00:24:34.780 --> 00:24:38.580
Nicholas Maduro as his vice president Maduro had been in government for a while,

405
00:24:38.800 --> 00:24:43.300
but he was an outsider to its real circles of power and singularly

406
00:24:43.450 --> 00:24:46.210
uncharismatic boot it's been Chavez,

407
00:24:46.211 --> 00:24:48.410
appointed him because he was the most dogmatic,

408
00:24:48.670 --> 00:24:52.850
but most likely to carry on the Bavarian revolution if something were to happen

409
00:24:52.870 --> 00:24:57.250
to Chavez, not long after it did in January,

410
00:24:57.250 --> 00:25:01.170
2013 Chavez was so well that he missed his own inauguration leading to confusion

411
00:25:01.171 --> 00:25:03.570
as to whether he was still even legally president.

412
00:25:04.030 --> 00:25:07.840
But that pretty soon became AOT point on March. The fifth, 2013,

413
00:25:07.990 --> 00:25:10.360
Hugo Chavez died of cancer less than a month later,

414
00:25:10.560 --> 00:25:15.000
a special election was held to decide who would replace our Presidente after 14

415
00:25:15.001 --> 00:25:18.360
years, despite the backing of all the media. And despite the Goodwill,

416
00:25:18.361 --> 00:25:22.080
the masses still felt towards Chavez his vice president, Neil as Maduro,

417
00:25:22.500 --> 00:25:24.240
barely squeaked home with him,

418
00:25:24.410 --> 00:25:28.150
50.6% of the vote yet squeak home. He did.

419
00:25:28.410 --> 00:25:32.110
And the rest is just so much painful history today.

420
00:25:32.140 --> 00:25:37.070
It's easy to look at the mess that is Venezuela and judge Hugo Chavez harshly.

421
00:25:37.290 --> 00:25:38.090
In many ways,

422
00:25:38.090 --> 00:25:42.990
his revolution really was a catastrophe crime sought under his watch turning

423
00:25:43.550 --> 00:25:48.260
Caracas from a relatively safe city into one of the most D capitals on

424
00:25:48.390 --> 00:25:49.040
earth.

425
00:25:49.040 --> 00:25:53.860
The economy too was as neglected as during the Punte GSMO like the elites before

426
00:25:53.861 --> 00:25:56.700
him Chavez simply took the oil money without thinking,

427
00:25:56.770 --> 00:25:58.140
leaving behind an economy.

428
00:25:58.280 --> 00:26:01.780
So dangerously unbalanced that even basic food staffs,

429
00:26:01.860 --> 00:26:04.780
Venezuela could produce domestically had to be imported.

430
00:26:04.960 --> 00:26:08.370
He acted up huge debt with China, as he chased the middle classes away,

431
00:26:08.530 --> 00:26:12.210
hundreds of thousands moved abroad, taking their business skills with them.

432
00:26:12.790 --> 00:26:13.580
So yes,

433
00:26:13.580 --> 00:26:18.330
there are a whole bunch of reasons you can blame modern Venezuela on Chavez's

434
00:26:18.331 --> 00:26:22.610
rule. Many reasons why you can see his legacy as nothing but poison,

435
00:26:23.110 --> 00:26:26.370
but that's not the whole picture for the awful stuff. Hugo Chavez did.

436
00:26:26.640 --> 00:26:31.480
It's worth remembering one salient fact. The people really did love him.

437
00:26:31.780 --> 00:26:36.600
Not in the way north Koreans are forced to love Kim Jon UN gunpoint,

438
00:26:37.020 --> 00:26:39.720
but a real deep love that came from Chavez.

439
00:26:39.721 --> 00:26:43.760
Being the only man to ever listen to them and Chavez earned this love.

440
00:26:43.860 --> 00:26:45.440
He lifted millions out of poverty.

441
00:26:45.660 --> 00:26:50.360
He gave the forgotten masses paths to education means to improve their lives in

442
00:26:50.361 --> 00:26:54.320
ways that never dreams in another time with a different personality,

443
00:26:54.550 --> 00:26:58.600
Hugo Chavez could have been remembered as Venezuela's Franklin D Roosevelt,

444
00:26:58.940 --> 00:27:02.200
the first president to speak for the common man. Sadly,

445
00:27:02.650 --> 00:27:06.310
we don't live in that time and Chavez didn't have a better personality.

446
00:27:06.580 --> 00:27:09.990
What he did have though, was an undeniably historic impact.

447
00:27:10.290 --> 00:27:13.870
If history is simply the story of men and women who changed the world around

448
00:27:13.871 --> 00:27:14.111
them,

449
00:27:14.111 --> 00:27:18.950
then Hugo Chavez will always remain one of Venezuela's most important chapters

450
00:27:19.250 --> 00:27:20.510
for better and for worse,

451
00:27:20.650 --> 00:27:25.380
he changed his nation more profoundly than anyone likely will again for

452
00:27:25.381 --> 00:27:28.860
centuries. So I really hope you found that video. Interesting. If you did,
