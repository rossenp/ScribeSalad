00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:02.940
<v 0>We know you guys like pirates every time we make a video about pirates,</v>

2
00:00:02.941 --> 00:00:05.250
that gets loads of views. So today we're going to be profiling.

3
00:00:05.251 --> 00:00:09.600
Another heavily requested scallywag of the seas, black Bart Roberts.

4
00:00:09.630 --> 00:00:12.840
But before we do any of that, I want to thank today's sponsor morning brew,

5
00:00:12.841 --> 00:00:14.400
just like a rich cup of coffee.

6
00:00:14.401 --> 00:00:17.970
Morning brew is a totally free daily newsletter that you won't want to start

7
00:00:17.971 --> 00:00:19.050
your day without.

8
00:00:19.110 --> 00:00:21.930
It's a quick well-organized look and it's both the lines and having used that

9
00:00:21.931 --> 00:00:24.900
you can receive every day, Monday through Saturday,

10
00:00:25.020 --> 00:00:28.740
who has the time to sit down and watch the news every morning.

11
00:00:28.860 --> 00:00:30.990
Not me who has the stamina,

12
00:00:31.510 --> 00:00:35.970
just slog through a dry crusty section in your local newspaper,

13
00:00:36.150 --> 00:00:37.200
every single day,

14
00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:42.150
who trusts that Twitter is going to vomit up topics that you definitely need

15
00:00:42.151 --> 00:00:42.984
to know about.

16
00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:47.310
Nobody morning brew tells me what I need to know along with some really cooler,

17
00:00:47.311 --> 00:00:51.360
interesting tidbits that I could keep in my back pocket uses little conversation

18
00:00:51.361 --> 00:00:54.960
starters. So for instance, earlier today, I was reading my most recent copy.

19
00:00:55.230 --> 00:00:56.400
It's the 12th of October.

20
00:00:56.401 --> 00:00:59.580
So that's the one and it had all these good bite size bits of information,

21
00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:03.750
hurricane Delta in the United States, the conclusion of the French open,

22
00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:05.850
which I already knew about stay, you know,

23
00:01:05.940 --> 00:01:09.240
I like tennis and some market transactions I'd have never picked up on

24
00:01:09.241 --> 00:01:10.860
otherwise. There was also a cool story,

25
00:01:10.861 --> 00:01:14.700
how Richard Branson was trying to raise $200 million for Virgin orbit.

26
00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:18.690
So all of that great stuff. So if you like finance current events or TAC,

27
00:01:18.691 --> 00:01:21.420
or even if you just want to keep up with some basic headlines,

28
00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:25.410
there is absolutely no reason not to subscribe to the morning brew. Like I said,

29
00:01:25.411 --> 00:01:28.530
it's totally free and it takes about 10 seconds.

30
00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:31.830
So click the link in the description below and let's get into today's video.

31
00:01:32.150 --> 00:01:32.983
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

32
00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:41.750
<v 0>We've used the term most successful pirates here quite a few times in previous</v>

33
00:01:41.751 --> 00:01:42.740
biographics videos,

34
00:01:42.741 --> 00:01:47.600
but that's because there is no single thing that accurately defines the success

35
00:01:47.601 --> 00:01:50.990
of piracy. Black dead was the most notorious of the bunch.

36
00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:55.190
Black Sam Bellamy probably accrued more wealth as a pirate than any other. Well,

37
00:01:55.191 --> 00:02:00.080
Henry every pulls off the single biggest score in history and more importantly,

38
00:02:00.081 --> 00:02:01.610
managed to get away with it. Today.

39
00:02:01.760 --> 00:02:06.680
We are using another metric to establish the periodical credentials of calves in

40
00:02:06.681 --> 00:02:09.920
Bartholomew, Roberts, AKA black bot.

41
00:02:10.280 --> 00:02:14.300
The number of prizes taken that refers to the number of ships that he captured

42
00:02:14.420 --> 00:02:18.830
plundered or ransomed Roberts is credited with well over 400 prizes,

43
00:02:18.860 --> 00:02:22.130
all within the short timeframe of just three years.

44
00:02:22.160 --> 00:02:24.560
One of the men who defined the golden age of piracy,

45
00:02:24.710 --> 00:02:28.910
there was a time when he was considered invincible and every merchant and sailor

46
00:02:28.940 --> 00:02:33.530
in the Atlantic knew and feared the name Bartholomew Roberts.

47
00:02:40.130 --> 00:02:40.210
<v 1>John Robbins.</v>

48
00:02:40.210 --> 00:02:44.750
<v 0>This was born in 1682 in the tiny village of little Newcastle in Wales at one</v>

49
00:02:44.751 --> 00:02:48.500
point. So he changed his first name to Bartholomew. We're not sure why or when,

50
00:02:48.501 --> 00:02:50.360
but it was quite common for pirates to use.

51
00:02:50.390 --> 00:02:53.780
Aliases is also well known today by the Monica black box,

52
00:02:53.810 --> 00:02:58.280
which she shares with a wild West outlaw whose real name was Charles Bowles.

53
00:02:58.310 --> 00:03:02.590
Maybe we'll cover someday as well. However, unlike bowls bustling you it,

54
00:03:02.710 --> 00:03:05.140
so it's seemingly never called black box in his lifetime.

55
00:03:05.230 --> 00:03:08.350
Instead this nickname came from a poem written about him hundreds of years

56
00:03:08.351 --> 00:03:08.860
later,

57
00:03:08.860 --> 00:03:12.310
as is the case with all of the other pirates we've covered here on biographics.

58
00:03:12.311 --> 00:03:16.090
We have a dearth of knowledge when it comes to Robert's his early years,

59
00:03:16.120 --> 00:03:20.380
the information we do possess about his periodical career comes to us. Again,

60
00:03:20.500 --> 00:03:24.340
courtesy of Charles Johnson is a general history of the pirates,

61
00:03:24.370 --> 00:03:28.570
which is not incredibly reliable, but I mean, it's what we have to work with.

62
00:03:28.780 --> 00:03:32.260
Unlike many of his compatriots Roberts was a reluctance pirates.

63
00:03:32.290 --> 00:03:34.630
It is believed that he became a sailor from a young age,

64
00:03:34.660 --> 00:03:38.530
but we have no accurate records of his service until 1719.

65
00:03:38.650 --> 00:03:39.670
At that point he was already,

66
00:03:39.671 --> 00:03:43.180
the second is made to bought a slave shed called the princess under the commands

67
00:03:43.360 --> 00:03:45.430
of a captain plumb. In the summer of that year,

68
00:03:45.431 --> 00:03:49.210
the princess sailed to the gold coast of West Africa to pick up slaves from

69
00:03:49.780 --> 00:03:52.840
anima Bowie present day Animoto in Ghana on its way back.

70
00:03:52.841 --> 00:03:56.260
The ship was attacked by pirates under the commands of captain Howell,

71
00:03:56.290 --> 00:04:00.430
Davis himself, a Welshman from the same County of prem Berkshire as Roberts,

72
00:04:00.520 --> 00:04:03.790
the pirates captured the princess and plundered it. If it's valuable loose,

73
00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:05.450
when something like this occurred,

74
00:04:05.490 --> 00:04:08.980
that we usually one of two things that happened to the surviving sailors.

75
00:04:09.040 --> 00:04:12.160
If their ship was still see whether and assuming that the pirates didn't know

76
00:04:12.340 --> 00:04:15.100
what to add it to their fleet, then they were usually free to go.

77
00:04:15.190 --> 00:04:16.690
If the ship could not set anymore,

78
00:04:16.691 --> 00:04:19.390
then the remaining sailors were brought on board, the pirate vessel,

79
00:04:19.600 --> 00:04:23.680
and either placed in a raft or dropped off at a nearby Island. In both cases,

80
00:04:23.681 --> 00:04:27.310
pirates usually gave some of the sailors an opportunity to join them since after

81
00:04:27.311 --> 00:04:29.560
all they needed to refill their ranks, too.

82
00:04:29.620 --> 00:04:31.930
This was typically done on a volunteer basis,

83
00:04:31.931 --> 00:04:35.140
but some men were forced to join up with the pirates whether they wanted to or

84
00:04:35.141 --> 00:04:35.770
not.

85
00:04:35.770 --> 00:04:39.400
Usually this was because they were skilled in an important area like medicine,

86
00:04:39.401 --> 00:04:40.780
carpentry on navigation.

87
00:04:40.900 --> 00:04:44.980
Roberts was among the men forced to join a whole Davis's crew above the Royal

88
00:04:45.450 --> 00:04:46.690
Rover. We're not sure why,

89
00:04:46.691 --> 00:04:50.560
but maybe the captain fancied having a fellow Pembrokeshire native aboard the

90
00:04:50.561 --> 00:04:54.580
ship. And that is how Bartholomew Roberts became the pirate.

91
00:05:00.810 --> 00:05:01.530
<v 2>[Inaudible].</v>

92
00:05:01.530 --> 00:05:03.600
<v 0>And also been thrilled with being a pirate at first,</v>

93
00:05:03.601 --> 00:05:07.050
but he soon discovered that he was pretty good at it and eventually took to it

94
00:05:07.051 --> 00:05:08.490
like a duck to water. Again,

95
00:05:08.491 --> 00:05:12.420
we don't know much about his maritime experience prior to turning to piracy,

96
00:05:12.421 --> 00:05:16.350
but it seems that Roberts was a very skilled sailor and an affable person in

97
00:05:16.351 --> 00:05:16.890
general,

98
00:05:16.890 --> 00:05:20.070
he quickly became regarded as one of the most indispensable crewman aboard the

99
00:05:20.310 --> 00:05:21.990
roll robot. He was so popular, in fact,

100
00:05:22.080 --> 00:05:25.740
so that he became the new captain just six weeks after it was abducted from the

101
00:05:25.741 --> 00:05:28.260
princess. His promotion came out of necessity,

102
00:05:28.261 --> 00:05:32.280
not any kind of amnesty towards the previous captain Davis had taken the ship to

103
00:05:32.281 --> 00:05:33.390
the islands of Prince CAEP,

104
00:05:33.420 --> 00:05:35.730
which back then was falling to the Portuguese embark.

105
00:05:35.820 --> 00:05:39.480
He flew British colors and was grounded, safe passage into the Harbor.

106
00:05:39.570 --> 00:05:41.640
His plan was to gain the governance. Trust,

107
00:05:41.970 --> 00:05:44.460
invites him on board the Rover and then hold him for ransom.

108
00:05:44.490 --> 00:05:45.840
It didn't really work out like that.

109
00:05:45.841 --> 00:05:48.960
The governor didn't fall for the Roos and instead planned his own counter

110
00:05:48.961 --> 00:05:52.350
attack. He invited the captain to join him for lunch, pal Davis,

111
00:05:52.351 --> 00:05:55.620
and a small retinue left his ship and traveled to the Island Fort,

112
00:05:55.830 --> 00:05:59.510
but they were ambushed the way and executed with David's dead.

113
00:05:59.540 --> 00:06:01.340
The role Reva needed a new captain.

114
00:06:01.370 --> 00:06:04.630
Charles Johnson describes the election process as being quite offensive.

115
00:06:04.631 --> 00:06:08.150
One like you would expect to see in parliaments and not on a pirate ship

116
00:06:08.600 --> 00:06:11.240
disliking the British parliament, the men were divided into Lords and commons.

117
00:06:11.241 --> 00:06:13.040
The format being made up of officers as well.

118
00:06:13.160 --> 00:06:15.590
The latter consisted of all the regular crew members.

119
00:06:15.680 --> 00:06:19.010
Only the Lords were allowed to propose candidates for the position of captain.

120
00:06:19.011 --> 00:06:22.850
And then everyone voted on it. One Lord's named Dennis proposed Bartholomew.

121
00:06:23.390 --> 00:06:26.390
Robertsons gave an impassioned speech to show his support. He said,

122
00:06:26.540 --> 00:06:28.490
it is my advice that while we are sober,

123
00:06:28.610 --> 00:06:31.910
we pitch upon a man of courage and skilled and navigation.

124
00:06:32.030 --> 00:06:34.520
One who by his counsel and his bravery.

125
00:06:34.521 --> 00:06:39.230
It seems best able to defend this Commonwealth and waters from the dangers and

126
00:06:39.890 --> 00:06:43.670
Tempest seven unstable elements and to the fatal consequences of anarchy and

127
00:06:43.730 --> 00:06:46.430
such a one. I take rods to be a fellow.

128
00:06:46.460 --> 00:06:50.330
I think in all respects worthy of your esteem and favor.

129
00:06:50.570 --> 00:06:53.300
This was enough to go on a cheers from everyone aboard the ship,

130
00:06:53.301 --> 00:06:57.530
except for another Lord named Simpson who presumably had hopes of assuming the

131
00:06:57.531 --> 00:07:01.790
position itself and that's is how Bartholomew Roberts became a pirate captain.

132
00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:06.110
He accepted the promotion sayings that since he had dipped his hands and muddy

133
00:07:06.111 --> 00:07:10.310
water and must be a pirate, it was better being a commander.

134
00:07:10.810 --> 00:07:11.643
<v 2>Then a common man.</v>

135
00:07:18.650 --> 00:07:19.361
<v 0>Was in charge.</v>

136
00:07:19.361 --> 00:07:22.510
His first course of action was to avenge the death of his predecessor.

137
00:07:22.570 --> 00:07:25.450
The ship started battering. The Portuguese fought with cannon fire,

138
00:07:25.451 --> 00:07:27.430
but this was all a distraction.

139
00:07:27.460 --> 00:07:31.660
Mental honey to 30 man expedition that had made landfall and was approaching the

140
00:07:31.661 --> 00:07:34.510
Fort on foot. As they took the soldiers inside by surprise.

141
00:07:34.511 --> 00:07:37.450
And the survivors quickly abandoned that post and fled into town.

142
00:07:37.570 --> 00:07:41.650
The pirates then burns the Fort down and pushed all of their cannons into the

143
00:07:41.651 --> 00:07:43.570
sea before returning to their ship.

144
00:07:43.660 --> 00:07:46.270
Some of the men did not consider this sufficient punishment.

145
00:07:46.271 --> 00:07:49.030
Just captain Davis had been quite popular with his crew.

146
00:07:49.060 --> 00:07:50.890
They wanted to burn down the town itself,

147
00:07:50.891 --> 00:07:54.460
but Robert's considered that there was no way to do this without sustaining

148
00:07:54.461 --> 00:07:55.480
heavy casualties.

149
00:07:55.481 --> 00:07:58.900
Especially now that the locals were expecting an attack in the ends,

150
00:07:58.901 --> 00:08:01.840
the crew of the RA Rover compromise, they manned different ship,

151
00:08:01.870 --> 00:08:05.920
which they'd captured in the Harbor sailed into shallow waters near the town and

152
00:08:05.921 --> 00:08:06.160
shelter.

153
00:08:06.160 --> 00:08:09.490
If you can involve these to satisfy the need for revenge on their way out.

154
00:08:09.491 --> 00:08:13.330
So they even found a couple of Portuguese ships and burn them down as a bonus

155
00:08:13.420 --> 00:08:13.841
from there,

156
00:08:13.841 --> 00:08:17.650
the ship sailed back to Anna Mabo is the place where Robinson sporadical career

157
00:08:17.651 --> 00:08:21.610
first started to pick up provisions and performer paths on the way they also

158
00:08:21.611 --> 00:08:25.110
captured a Dutch Guinea men and an English ship called the experiment.

159
00:08:25.300 --> 00:08:29.230
He's captain joined up with black box crew. Anyway, as we said in the intro,

160
00:08:29.231 --> 00:08:32.560
Roberts took over 400 prizes during his three years as a pirate.

161
00:08:32.800 --> 00:08:35.830
Obviously we can't mention every single one. So from here on out,

162
00:08:36.100 --> 00:08:37.900
we're only going to talk about the notable ones.

163
00:08:37.930 --> 00:08:41.170
Once the ship was ready to sail, it needed a destination.

164
00:08:41.200 --> 00:08:43.480
The crew took a vote and selected Brazil.

165
00:08:43.570 --> 00:08:47.170
They embarked on a month long trip and derived at an uninhabited Island off the

166
00:08:47.171 --> 00:08:49.090
coast of Brazil named Fernando,

167
00:08:49.091 --> 00:08:51.880
which served as their base of operations for the months to come.

168
00:08:51.910 --> 00:08:55.320
Robert spent around nine weeks prowling the waters of South America,

169
00:08:55.350 --> 00:08:57.960
but found a very slim pickings when it came to prizes,

170
00:08:58.170 --> 00:09:01.020
he and his group decided to sail to the West Indies. Instead,

171
00:09:01.060 --> 00:09:04.170
as we're getting ready to leave, when they chanced upon a remarkable site,

172
00:09:04.350 --> 00:09:09.330
it was a large Portuguese fleet of 42 ships sitting in Brazil's all saints Bay

173
00:09:09.331 --> 00:09:13.170
waiting for two powerful men of war to escort them back to Lisbon.

174
00:09:13.290 --> 00:09:15.210
Obviously Roberts was heavily outnumbered,

175
00:09:15.240 --> 00:09:17.520
but this did not deter him where other pirates would.

176
00:09:17.580 --> 00:09:20.280
It immediately turned around and set sail as fast as possible.

177
00:09:20.490 --> 00:09:22.530
He simply looked for an alternative strategy.

178
00:09:22.620 --> 00:09:25.080
He didn't engage the fleets in open combat, of course,

179
00:09:25.081 --> 00:09:28.050
but Roberts rackings that's with the elements of surprise on his side,

180
00:09:28.051 --> 00:09:31.440
he could capture one ship and to make us escape before the rest of the fleet

181
00:09:31.740 --> 00:09:35.940
caught on the question was which ship one advantage when dealing with a large

182
00:09:35.941 --> 00:09:38.370
fleet is that it's pretty easy to get lost among them.

183
00:09:38.520 --> 00:09:42.000
The Royal Rover was able to infiltrate the fleet without anybody noticing.

184
00:09:42.030 --> 00:09:45.750
They approached one at the Portuguese vessels and persuaded their ships Mazda to

185
00:09:45.751 --> 00:09:49.350
come on board the Rover only then did he understand the situation he was on the

186
00:09:49.351 --> 00:09:53.100
deck of a pirate ship. If he tried to give any signal or sign of distress,

187
00:09:53.101 --> 00:09:56.790
he would immediately be cut down and his own ship would be attacked and punted

188
00:09:57.000 --> 00:09:58.740
without giving any quarter. Instead,

189
00:09:58.741 --> 00:10:01.980
captain Roberts promised him that he would be returned safe and sound to his

190
00:10:01.981 --> 00:10:03.240
vessel and left alone.

191
00:10:03.510 --> 00:10:06.870
The only thing he had to do was point at the richest ship in the fleet,

192
00:10:07.020 --> 00:10:09.480
unsurprisingly, the Portuguese captain, and found this an offer.

193
00:10:09.481 --> 00:10:13.440
He couldn't refuse and directed the pirates towards the launch 40 gun ship,

194
00:10:13.500 --> 00:10:16.230
which was significantly more powerful than the roll robot.

195
00:10:16.470 --> 00:10:20.420
Even though it clearly was not expecting one of the other ships to open fire in

196
00:10:20.430 --> 00:10:21.990
it. And despite its strength,

197
00:10:22.020 --> 00:10:24.840
the pirates managed to claim this with any two casualties.

198
00:10:24.960 --> 00:10:28.170
They were sailing away by the time the rest of the fleet realized what had

199
00:10:28.171 --> 00:10:31.500
happened. And by then it was already too late to catch up with them.

200
00:10:31.680 --> 00:10:32.401
Once they were safe,

201
00:10:32.401 --> 00:10:35.460
the pirates inspected that plunder and discovered that they had struck the

202
00:10:36.030 --> 00:10:38.280
Motherload. The ship's cargo was filled with valuable goods,

203
00:10:38.281 --> 00:10:41.550
such as tobacco and sugar jewels and precious Jens,

204
00:10:41.551 --> 00:10:43.770
including a gold cross set with diamonds made,

205
00:10:43.771 --> 00:10:47.610
especially for the King of Portugal and over 40,000 Portuguese gold coins.

206
00:10:54.680 --> 00:10:55.513
<v 1>After that.</v>

207
00:10:55.790 --> 00:10:59.660
<v 0>The pirate sounds up North or a bit and began prowling the waters off the coast</v>

208
00:10:59.661 --> 00:11:02.810
of Suriname and Guiana. After taking a few more prizes,

209
00:11:03.410 --> 00:11:05.060
tunes changed for Buffalo, Jimmy Roberts,

210
00:11:05.300 --> 00:11:09.410
he had heard of a Portuguese Brigid ezine sailing in those waters and wanted to

211
00:11:09.800 --> 00:11:12.350
plunder it. He assembled a group of 40 men and boarded a sleep,

212
00:11:12.380 --> 00:11:15.650
which was smaller than the Rover, but also faster. Meanwhile,

213
00:11:15.710 --> 00:11:19.730
he left his own ship as well as the captured Portuguese vassal with all the news

214
00:11:19.731 --> 00:11:22.670
and the command of a crew member named Walter Kennedy.

215
00:11:22.850 --> 00:11:25.010
The Snoop had no luck going after the brigand team.

216
00:11:25.130 --> 00:11:27.920
Robert spent eight days trying to catch up to the Portuguese ship,

217
00:11:28.070 --> 00:11:31.430
opposing winds and currents just kept driving and back further.

218
00:11:31.520 --> 00:11:33.500
Eventually the supplies were starting to run out.

219
00:11:33.501 --> 00:11:37.100
So he had to give up the chase, but that's when things went from bad to West,

220
00:11:37.130 --> 00:11:40.370
the Snoop was approached by a boat containing some of the men left behind on the

221
00:11:40.371 --> 00:11:42.860
Rover and they informed Roberts that in his absence,

222
00:11:42.890 --> 00:11:46.190
Kennedy had proclaimed himself captain with the support of some of the men,

223
00:11:46.250 --> 00:11:49.370
the ones still laws Roberts were allowed to depart on the captured Portuguese

224
00:11:49.400 --> 00:11:50.030
prize,

225
00:11:50.030 --> 00:11:54.010
but everybody else took the Raul driver and sailed away it that they'd split the

226
00:11:54.190 --> 00:11:56.560
loot in half before departing so well,

227
00:11:56.650 --> 00:11:59.110
I suppose there's some honor among thieves in the end,

228
00:11:59.140 --> 00:12:01.600
this turned out to be a poor choice for the men who bought the Rover.

229
00:12:01.630 --> 00:12:04.090
Many of them wanted to leave the pirate life behind,

230
00:12:04.091 --> 00:12:07.540
or at least take a break to spend some of the treasure they intended to go to

231
00:12:08.050 --> 00:12:10.210
Ireland, but there weren't any good navigators among them.

232
00:12:10.211 --> 00:12:11.650
So they ended up in Scotland.

233
00:12:12.030 --> 00:12:15.250
The other rowdy pirates started causing problems in every town and village they

234
00:12:15.251 --> 00:12:17.350
walked into. And as many of them were arrested,

235
00:12:17.380 --> 00:12:20.710
one of the local authorities established that they were pirates and they risked

236
00:12:20.740 --> 00:12:24.400
death sentence. So in order to avoid the hangman's noose,

237
00:12:24.401 --> 00:12:26.650
they started giving evidence against each other.

238
00:12:26.651 --> 00:12:30.370
Bleeding do even more arrests and executions. As Walter Kennedy,

239
00:12:30.580 --> 00:12:32.800
he quickly spent most of his share of the treasure.

240
00:12:32.801 --> 00:12:36.010
Then he traveled to London where he was recognized by a sailor whose ship he

241
00:12:36.011 --> 00:12:40.660
wants to tact. It was arrested and executed for piracy in 1721,

242
00:12:40.720 --> 00:12:44.320
back to Robinson, his men often the anger, the betrayal started fading.

243
00:12:44.470 --> 00:12:47.560
They resolved to devise a new way to keep order and try and prevent something

244
00:12:47.561 --> 00:12:50.920
like that from happening again. So they came up with a pirate code.

245
00:12:51.040 --> 00:12:53.440
Now there are lots of misconceptions about the pirate code.

246
00:12:53.441 --> 00:12:56.530
So let's quickly get some of them out of the way black violence pirate code.

247
00:12:56.560 --> 00:12:59.590
Wasn't the only one. There wasn't even the first that we know of,

248
00:12:59.591 --> 00:13:01.480
but given Robert's high profile.

249
00:13:01.481 --> 00:13:05.890
And the fact that his code was described in detail in Charles Johnson's book,

250
00:13:06.130 --> 00:13:07.570
it became the most famous.

251
00:13:07.600 --> 00:13:10.960
We should also point out that there has never been a universal code that all

252
00:13:10.961 --> 00:13:14.140
pirates around the world were somehow obliged to a Bay,

253
00:13:14.200 --> 00:13:15.610
walking up to a pirate and saying.

254
00:13:16.350 --> 00:13:17.850
<v 3>Paula, the one Paula.</v>

255
00:13:20.310 --> 00:13:22.560
<v 0>It would not magically stop him from killing you.</v>

256
00:13:22.770 --> 00:13:26.100
Most of the articles in Robinson's code had to do with discipline aboard the

257
00:13:26.101 --> 00:13:29.940
ship and distribution of plunder. Some of them were pretty obvious, no gambling,

258
00:13:29.941 --> 00:13:32.850
no stealing, no fighting a board. The ship, some were a bit weirder.

259
00:13:32.880 --> 00:13:34.500
The 11th article for example said,

260
00:13:34.710 --> 00:13:37.320
the musicians do have a rest on the Sabbath day,

261
00:13:37.410 --> 00:13:41.010
but the other six days and nights, none without special favor,

262
00:13:41.070 --> 00:13:44.190
many of the rules show a discipline that we would not normally associate with

263
00:13:44.191 --> 00:13:44.850
pirates.

264
00:13:44.850 --> 00:13:48.390
All the crewmen were expected to keep that swords and pistols clean and fit for

265
00:13:48.391 --> 00:13:51.000
service. There was a curfew at eight o'clock at night,

266
00:13:51.001 --> 00:13:54.990
and those who wanted to keep drinking or talking or whatever pirates did we're

267
00:13:55.170 --> 00:13:56.790
only allowed to do so above deck,

268
00:13:56.850 --> 00:13:59.100
no boys or women could be brought onto the ship.

269
00:13:59.160 --> 00:14:01.080
If a woman did somehow end up on board,

270
00:14:01.230 --> 00:14:04.770
she was to be guarded by a Sentinel to secure the ladies virtue.

271
00:14:04.770 --> 00:14:08.730
And any attempt to molester would have been punishable by death pirates,

272
00:14:08.731 --> 00:14:12.810
also risked death or marooning if they abandoned their posts during battle.

273
00:14:13.050 --> 00:14:15.180
But that one was to be expected. Finally,

274
00:14:15.181 --> 00:14:18.120
there were a few articles that talked about how the loot was split.

275
00:14:18.180 --> 00:14:20.790
There is a misconception that the captain took most of the treasure,

276
00:14:20.791 --> 00:14:23.550
and that's not true at all. Not only in Robinson's case,

277
00:14:23.551 --> 00:14:27.390
but with most all captains, most men turned to piracy to make money.

278
00:14:27.391 --> 00:14:30.540
And so they would have not accepted to risk their lives just to make money for

279
00:14:30.541 --> 00:14:31.374
somebody else.

280
00:14:31.380 --> 00:14:34.830
Even the hints of such a rule would have resulted in instant mutiny,

281
00:14:35.160 --> 00:14:39.030
no Roberts and presumably most other pirate captains were entitled to a double

282
00:14:39.420 --> 00:14:42.210
shaft meaning that he only took twice as much as any crewman.

283
00:14:42.270 --> 00:14:44.010
The quartermaster also had a double shad.

284
00:14:44.011 --> 00:14:47.520
The master gunner and boatswain took a shower and a half. Well,

285
00:14:47.640 --> 00:14:51.890
all of the remaining offices were entitled to a share and a quarter the and

286
00:14:52.220 --> 00:14:54.110
liquor were divided equally among the whole crew.

287
00:14:54.111 --> 00:14:57.800
And each man was free to enjoy his portion at his discretion unless there was a

288
00:14:57.801 --> 00:14:59.180
scarcity at which point,

289
00:14:59.181 --> 00:15:02.960
a vote of retrenchments would be called for the pirates were even entitled to

290
00:15:02.961 --> 00:15:05.900
workers' compensation. If they lost a limb during service,

291
00:15:05.901 --> 00:15:10.460
they would receive $800 from a public funds and proportionally less for smaller

292
00:15:10.461 --> 00:15:12.740
injuries. This all sounds nice in theory,

293
00:15:12.920 --> 00:15:15.620
but it shouldn't give you the wrong impression about life on board.

294
00:15:15.621 --> 00:15:19.790
A pirate ship in reality pirates were more often than not willing to cheat fight

295
00:15:20.420 --> 00:15:20.450
steal,

296
00:15:20.450 --> 00:15:24.710
rape ends murder just to suit their own desires and trying to keep them all in

297
00:15:24.711 --> 00:15:27.470
line was a constant challenge for the captain and his officers.

298
00:15:33.940 --> 00:15:37.630
It was at the Royal Rover. Robert sent to use his sloop as his new flagship.

299
00:15:37.840 --> 00:15:41.530
He renamed it, the fortunate name he would use for other ships as well,

300
00:15:41.531 --> 00:15:44.950
going forward. Of course, it wasn't as powerful as this form of craft.

301
00:15:44.951 --> 00:15:46.690
So you have to choose this fights more carefully.

302
00:15:46.960 --> 00:15:49.900
He was successful multiple times, but in early 17, 20,

303
00:15:50.170 --> 00:15:54.190
he was chased out of the West Indies by a few well-armed French pirate hunters

304
00:15:54.220 --> 00:15:58.210
who had been assembled specifically to deal with black bot and his elk,

305
00:15:58.510 --> 00:16:01.720
Robert sales North, all the way to Newfoundlands in present day Canada,

306
00:16:01.870 --> 00:16:05.320
where he arguably caused most of his destruction in late June.

307
00:16:05.321 --> 00:16:06.500
He entered the Harbor of Travis,

308
00:16:06.630 --> 00:16:09.220
which was filled with 22 merchant and shipping vessels.

309
00:16:09.430 --> 00:16:11.260
None of them were equipped to fight pirates.

310
00:16:11.261 --> 00:16:13.720
So they were all at the mercy of Buffalo, mew Roberts,

311
00:16:13.960 --> 00:16:16.960
and they found it lacking. The pirate, burned down all the ships,

312
00:16:16.961 --> 00:16:20.590
except for one gallery, which was added to his fleet. Not long afterwards,

313
00:16:20.591 --> 00:16:23.350
Robinson counts at a French convoy of 10 ships, which again,

314
00:16:23.351 --> 00:16:25.330
he destroyed except for another sloop,

315
00:16:25.331 --> 00:16:27.580
which he captained exchanged for the galley.

316
00:16:27.670 --> 00:16:30.100
The prizes kept on coming one after another,

317
00:16:30.101 --> 00:16:32.650
with little to no reprisals from the targets,

318
00:16:32.830 --> 00:16:35.620
none of them were powerful enough to match up against the pirate fleet.

319
00:16:35.710 --> 00:16:38.680
Eventually Robins decided it was time for another change of scenery.

320
00:16:38.681 --> 00:16:42.310
So he sailed back to the West Indies where he continued his plundering ways,

321
00:16:42.340 --> 00:16:43.600
mostly unimpeded.

322
00:16:43.690 --> 00:16:46.270
The worst thing that happened to him was that another one of his officers,

323
00:16:46.271 --> 00:16:50.770
a man named Thomas Ansstas deserted and took one of the ships with a full crew

324
00:16:50.950 --> 00:16:54.190
and went independence. This happens while Roberts was headed to Africa,

325
00:16:54.220 --> 00:16:57.820
because again, he thought it was time to change locations and stirs.

326
00:16:57.820 --> 00:16:59.830
And does man wants to keep sailing the Caribbean.

327
00:16:59.831 --> 00:17:02.410
So they snuck away during the night in Africa,

328
00:17:02.440 --> 00:17:04.720
it was business as usual for Robinson, his crew,

329
00:17:04.721 --> 00:17:08.500
as they kept plundering dozens of vessels Roberts might've liked to dress in

330
00:17:08.501 --> 00:17:10.390
fancy clothes and speak like a gentleman,

331
00:17:10.540 --> 00:17:12.820
but he showed his true Bob Barrack side.

332
00:17:12.821 --> 00:17:15.340
When the captain of a slave ship refused to pay a ransom.

333
00:17:15.341 --> 00:17:19.210
So Blackbaud had his vessels satchel on fire with all the slaves still trapped

334
00:17:19.211 --> 00:17:21.520
in the galley. This happens in January 17,

335
00:17:21.521 --> 00:17:24.040
22 and perhaps in a display of calmer,

336
00:17:24.250 --> 00:17:27.610
the end game for Roberts just a few weeks later on February the 10th,

337
00:17:27.611 --> 00:17:32.080
when he encountered the HMS swallow of the Royal Navy captains by Shalonda Ogle,

338
00:17:32.170 --> 00:17:36.010
this was a 50 gun ship of the line and would have been more than a match for

339
00:17:36.011 --> 00:17:40.270
Roberts even on a good day. And this was not a good day for the pirate captain.

340
00:17:40.450 --> 00:17:41.231
Earlier that morning,

341
00:17:41.231 --> 00:17:44.830
Roberts had taken a prize trading vessel called the Neptune. Consequently,

342
00:17:44.860 --> 00:17:48.430
most of his men had been drinking and partying all day and were completely unfit

343
00:17:48.431 --> 00:17:49.050
for duty.

344
00:17:49.050 --> 00:17:52.050
The swallow would already destroyed one of the other ships in the pirate fleet

345
00:17:52.051 --> 00:17:54.480
on its way to engage Roberts aboard the raw fortune.

346
00:17:54.630 --> 00:17:57.510
Black violence had no intention to fight. He wanted to run away,

347
00:17:57.511 --> 00:17:59.970
but since he was partly surrounded by coastline,

348
00:18:00.300 --> 00:18:03.420
you have to turn around and sail within range of the swallows cannons.

349
00:18:03.480 --> 00:18:07.140
His ship would be exposed to at least one broadside shot.

350
00:18:07.590 --> 00:18:09.780
Johnson's sustaining heavy casualties from one shot was small,

351
00:18:09.781 --> 00:18:12.930
but fortunately was not with Bartholomew Roberts that day.

352
00:18:12.990 --> 00:18:15.990
The first grape shot from the Royal Navy ship had him right in the throat,

353
00:18:15.991 --> 00:18:19.800
killing him instantly as men abate his final wishes and quickly buried him at

354
00:18:19.801 --> 00:18:22.080
sea, but they will to fight a disappeared.

355
00:18:22.380 --> 00:18:24.750
And they surrendered soon after Bartholomew Roberts,

356
00:18:24.751 --> 00:18:28.740
the dread pirate thought by many to be indestructable vid throughout the whole

357
00:18:28.741 --> 00:18:32.580
of the Atlantic. After plundering, hundreds of ships was finally dead.

358
00:18:32.730 --> 00:18:35.820
He was the last of the well-known pirates, all the other ones. Backnet Henry,

359
00:18:35.821 --> 00:18:40.260
every Calico, Jack Black, Sam Bellamy, Charles vane. They all died before him.

360
00:18:40.440 --> 00:18:45.300
So many consider that the end of Bartholomew Roberts also signaled the end of

361
00:18:45.301 --> 00:18:48.780
the golden age of piracy. So really hope you found that video. Interesting.
