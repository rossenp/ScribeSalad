In today's video,

8
00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:37.910
we are going to be discussing the military achievements of an outstanding cast

9
00:00:37.930 --> 00:00:42.380
of characters, a finish officer who fought the red army on skis,

10
00:00:42.440 --> 00:00:47.340
an American green beret who led dangerous covert missions from Iran to

11
00:00:47.341 --> 00:00:47.960
Vietnam,

12
00:00:47.960 --> 00:00:52.540
and the only orphan SS soldier to be buried at the Arlington military

13
00:00:52.740 --> 00:00:55.700
cemetery in Virginia. What is truly unique though,

14
00:00:55.701 --> 00:00:59.740
is that all these personas were played by just one singular person,

15
00:01:00.220 --> 00:01:04.970
a natural born soldier who often ended up on the losing side, captured,

16
00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:07.930
betrayed exiled, but never defeated.

17
00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:12.530
He would rise from the ashes of war to continue his personal struggle against

18
00:01:12.590 --> 00:01:15.970
his sworn enemies. This is the story of Lonnie Tory,

19
00:01:16.190 --> 00:01:18.850
AKA Larry thorn, the Phoenix soldier,

20
00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:29.960
Lori Toney was born on may the 25th, 1919 in UR,

21
00:01:30.280 --> 00:01:33.680
a town on the Carol Imus, just north of Petrograd.

22
00:01:34.160 --> 00:01:38.320
Lori completed his studies excelling in sports, skiing and boxing among others.

23
00:01:38.500 --> 00:01:39.360
As he came of age,

24
00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:44.190
Lori joins the national reserve of the finish army following the partitioning of

25
00:01:44.260 --> 00:01:47.630
Polands by Germany and the Soviets in September of 1939,

26
00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:52.430
the Soviet union hoped to push its borders further west by capturing the Carol

27
00:01:53.230 --> 00:01:57.430
isthmus and securing Len grad, formerly Petrograd from a German attack.

28
00:01:57.490 --> 00:02:01.910
<v 1>The Soviets set also set their sites on several islands in the Gulf of Finlands</v>

29
00:02:02.030 --> 00:02:06.500
and on the hang Naval base. When Finland refused to grant such an annexation,

30
00:02:06.501 --> 00:02:11.180
Joseph Stalin ordered the invasion thus a few months after low's 20th birthday

31
00:02:11.240 --> 00:02:15.340
on November the 30th, 1939, the Soviet union invaded Finland.

32
00:02:15.480 --> 00:02:18.820
It was the beginning of the Russell finish war. Also known as the wind war.

33
00:02:18.920 --> 00:02:20.580
<v 0>The finish arms forces well led by Marshall,</v>

34
00:02:21.020 --> 00:02:25.690
Carl Gustav Manheimer former artist officer severely. Our numbers are now guns.

35
00:02:25.750 --> 00:02:28.690
The fins managed to put up one hell of a fight against the red army,

36
00:02:29.130 --> 00:02:30.010
a huge opponents,

37
00:02:30.011 --> 00:02:34.050
but one that was ill-equipped and poorly managed after Stalin had executed

38
00:02:34.051 --> 00:02:37.090
dozens of his top generals during the great purge of 1937,

39
00:02:37.190 --> 00:02:39.370
the Finnish army by contrast was a small,

40
00:02:39.610 --> 00:02:43.290
flexible unit that had perfected the art of winter warfare and defensive tactics

41
00:02:43.850 --> 00:02:47.600
exacting a huge to on the invaders. At the beginning of the war,

42
00:02:47.650 --> 00:02:51.560
young L was a junior Sergeant in charge of food supplies.

43
00:02:51.880 --> 00:02:53.560
Larry couldn't have felt at ease with his post.

44
00:02:53.580 --> 00:02:57.160
He clearly understood how a constant supply of nourishment was vital for the

45
00:02:57.440 --> 00:02:58.480
morale of his fellow troops,

46
00:02:58.500 --> 00:03:02.480
but he thought he was capable of much more than just supply line managements.

47
00:03:02.660 --> 00:03:05.720
One night as the temperature plummeted to minus 42 Celsius,

48
00:03:05.930 --> 00:03:10.880
Larry silently slipped out of the camp completely unseen and unheard by his

49
00:03:10.881 --> 00:03:15.280
own sentinels Sergeant to walked to a Soviet outpost captured a Russian soldier

50
00:03:15.920 --> 00:03:17.320
ends marched him back to the finish camp.

51
00:03:17.540 --> 00:03:22.110
The effects on his soldiers morale was galvanizing lower superiors realized that

52
00:03:22.111 --> 00:03:26.550
this 20 year old NCO had a talent for light I infantry missions and assigned him

53
00:03:26.570 --> 00:03:30.870
his first special task low was putting commands of an anti tank patrol.

54
00:03:30.940 --> 00:03:35.830
Basically it was people fighting on foot or on skis whose mission was to attack

55
00:03:35.831 --> 00:03:40.500
Soviet tanks and destroy them, which sounds really not easy at all,

56
00:03:40.680 --> 00:03:44.700
but against any logical be Larry and disqua did manage to blow out quite a few

57
00:03:44.790 --> 00:03:46.500
tanks and still live to tell the story.

58
00:03:46.590 --> 00:03:48.660
Larry and ti fins distinguished themselves,

59
00:03:48.661 --> 00:03:51.380
particularly at the siege of east laiti pocket.

60
00:03:51.530 --> 00:03:53.900
This was in late February of 1940 here,

61
00:03:53.901 --> 00:03:57.860
the fins in circled and wiped out a strong red army contingent capturing 71

62
00:03:57.910 --> 00:04:00.810
tanks, 206 trial and 12 armored cars.

63
00:04:01.410 --> 00:04:04.970
Larry was put on a special officers course becoming a second left tenant in

64
00:04:04.971 --> 00:04:06.330
March as a first assignment,

65
00:04:06.350 --> 00:04:09.370
he was put in charge of a company of ethnic Swed soldiers.

66
00:04:09.520 --> 00:04:12.130
They did not speak Finn. Pete did not speak Swedish,

67
00:04:12.310 --> 00:04:16.530
but with the use of clear hand gestures and the common language of let's blow up

68
00:04:16.550 --> 00:04:19.970
the invaders, the young officer and his troops got along.

69
00:04:20.310 --> 00:04:24.000
Bely on a broader stage though, the war was not going well for Finland.

70
00:04:24.150 --> 00:04:26.560
Despite having bloodied the nose of the Soviet bear.

71
00:04:26.580 --> 00:04:28.520
The disadvantage in terms of manpower,

72
00:04:28.710 --> 00:04:32.960
artillery and tanks was starting to take its inevitable toll already by

73
00:04:33.160 --> 00:04:33.321
February.

74
00:04:33.321 --> 00:04:36.360
The Soviets had breached the Fin's main defensive line on the Southern end of

75
00:04:36.361 --> 00:04:39.200
the fronts, the Manheim line, once they broke through,

76
00:04:39.201 --> 00:04:43.950
they were able to occupy Carlia and threatened LA's hometown VII

77
00:04:44.020 --> 00:04:46.470
from the third through the 11th of March,

78
00:04:46.470 --> 00:04:50.030
1940 heavy fighting took place around the Caran capital while a finished

79
00:04:50.031 --> 00:04:53.310
delegation in Moscow sought to establish terms for a cease fire.

80
00:04:53.650 --> 00:04:57.470
The Moscow peace treaty was eventually signed at 2:00 AM on March the 13th.

81
00:04:57.830 --> 00:05:02.260
Finlands had to see 10% of its territory and 12% of it its population to the

82
00:05:02.261 --> 00:05:05.540
Soviet union, including Carol and V peri.

83
00:05:05.640 --> 00:05:07.540
It had been a per victory for the red army,

84
00:05:07.541 --> 00:05:12.500
which had suffered 167,000 Kaia and Mia versus

85
00:05:12.600 --> 00:05:16.820
26,000 on the finish side. But it had been of victory. Nonetheless,

86
00:05:16.960 --> 00:05:21.260
one that a lower 20 would never forget and never forgive

87
00:05:27.870 --> 00:05:28.850
At the end of the conflict.

88
00:05:29.210 --> 00:05:32.370
Larry was awarded the medals of independence first and second class,

89
00:05:32.371 --> 00:05:35.610
which became the first in a long series of decorations,

90
00:05:35.970 --> 00:05:39.370
but such accolades could not compensate for the humiliation of losing one 10th

91
00:05:39.371 --> 00:05:42.440
of his country to the invaders, including his home town.

92
00:05:42.880 --> 00:05:46.520
Larry was described both by friends and army superiors as quiet,

93
00:05:46.840 --> 00:05:47.840
pleasant and courteous.

94
00:05:47.940 --> 00:05:51.680
He was a well liked young man with whom it was easy to get along,

95
00:05:51.820 --> 00:05:56.720
but this mostly mild maned man had found a powerful vocation in fighting

96
00:05:56.721 --> 00:05:58.280
against a stronger opponent,

97
00:05:58.460 --> 00:06:02.040
either in direct or indirect service to Finlands.

98
00:06:02.070 --> 00:06:06.640
That is why in the late spring of 1941, when Finland was a neutral country,

99
00:06:06.790 --> 00:06:08.720
deep in the background of world war II,

100
00:06:09.560 --> 00:06:14.480
Lowry Toney decided to rise from his country's defeat and head back to battle

101
00:06:14.790 --> 00:06:19.230
this need for retribution drew of him to travel to Germany and secret and join a

102
00:06:19.240 --> 00:06:23.990
newly constituted, wha SS battalion, the free VI Nord dot.

103
00:06:24.090 --> 00:06:26.950
It was not uncommon for citizens of neutral, occupied,

104
00:06:26.951 --> 00:06:30.470
or even allied countries to volunteer for SS formations,

105
00:06:30.471 --> 00:06:35.030
either out of Simpy either the Nazi sea cause hatred of Bolshevism or both

106
00:06:35.450 --> 00:06:39.660
as part of the thrive VI Nord do Tony received intensive training,

107
00:06:39.661 --> 00:06:41.340
which honed his natural skillset,

108
00:06:41.550 --> 00:06:46.140
performing special operations deep inside enemy territory on June the 22nd,

109
00:06:46.580 --> 00:06:49.540
1941 axis forces invaded the Soviet union.

110
00:06:49.690 --> 00:06:53.860
This was the start of operation. Barbara RO Finland's joins the invasion,

111
00:06:54.000 --> 00:06:58.050
not as a formal member of the axis, but as a coll in country,

112
00:06:58.390 --> 00:07:02.290
the Finn objective was simply to recapture the territories that had lost in the

113
00:07:02.291 --> 00:07:03.210
treaty of Moscow,

114
00:07:03.270 --> 00:07:07.210
rather than expanding that living space Eastwood into a new land.

115
00:07:07.360 --> 00:07:12.210
This conflict became known as the continuation war and was again masterminded

116
00:07:12.350 --> 00:07:13.810
by field Marshall Manheim.

117
00:07:13.830 --> 00:07:18.600
The commander asked for Berlin to return the mini finish volunteers who joins

118
00:07:18.601 --> 00:07:23.600
the Vahan SS to replenish the army ranks with Lori Toney chief among them at

119
00:07:23.601 --> 00:07:24.840
the start of 1942.

120
00:07:24.840 --> 00:07:29.320
Second left tenant Toney was put in charge of a light infantry patrol deployed

121
00:07:29.540 --> 00:07:31.520
in Carle. It was payback time.

122
00:07:31.780 --> 00:07:35.080
His unit was part of the forces that drove the Soviets away from the Imus

123
00:07:35.320 --> 00:07:38.990
captured the main Garrison of Petro Avast. From there.

124
00:07:39.230 --> 00:07:43.230
Tony continued to push Northwood to reach the white sea Baltic canal then called

125
00:07:43.290 --> 00:07:47.110
the Starling canal. Laurie's advance was halted on March the 23rd,

126
00:07:47.430 --> 00:07:49.670
1942 while on a ski reconnaissance mission.

127
00:07:50.310 --> 00:07:53.670
Larry stepped over a landmine and was severely wounded or recovering in the

128
00:07:53.750 --> 00:07:54.270
hospital.

129
00:07:54.270 --> 00:07:58.070
Tony received a promotion who left tenants and in order to stay put for several

130
00:07:58.080 --> 00:08:02.180
weeks, which she absolutely ignored with fragments of shrapnel,

131
00:08:02.181 --> 00:08:03.300
still embedded in his body.

132
00:08:03.820 --> 00:08:08.460
Tony escaped from the military hospital to rejoin his old unit through 1943

133
00:08:09.020 --> 00:08:09.620
Lowry.

134
00:08:09.620 --> 00:08:13.460
Ledon trained several units in charge of connaissance and sabotage missions,

135
00:08:13.461 --> 00:08:16.220
deep behind enemy lines and exceptionally fit. Man.

136
00:08:16.240 --> 00:08:20.210
He expected his recruits to match his levels of strength, stamina, resilience,

137
00:08:20.510 --> 00:08:24.290
and skill in close quarters combat, especially with the Paco,

138
00:08:24.350 --> 00:08:25.890
the traditional finish knife,

139
00:08:26.150 --> 00:08:29.410
his company became known as the asaso to or the,

140
00:08:29.610 --> 00:08:33.610
to detachment its symbol was a capital T set against the backdrop of yellow

141
00:08:33.611 --> 00:08:34.280
lightning.

142
00:08:34.280 --> 00:08:38.490
Some of twenty's best documented exploits took place in the summer of 1944.

143
00:08:38.491 --> 00:08:43.280
When the red army launched counter actor retake the Carol Imus on June the

144
00:08:43.281 --> 00:08:46.440
ninth, a couple of days after D-Day a couple of thousand miles away,

145
00:08:46.660 --> 00:08:50.240
his division was at risk of once again, being engulfed by the Soviets,

146
00:08:50.241 --> 00:08:51.200
lefthand and Donny,

147
00:08:51.360 --> 00:08:54.280
and his unit managed to break a Soviet and supplement maneuver,

148
00:08:54.281 --> 00:08:57.160
inflicting heavy casualties on the enemy. Two weeks later,

149
00:08:57.560 --> 00:09:01.040
low personally performed an incursion behind enemy lines during which he

150
00:09:01.041 --> 00:09:04.600
acquired vital intelligence on the Soviet strategy intelligence,

151
00:09:04.610 --> 00:09:08.480
which helped his commanders hold off the counter attack in Carlia on the fifth

152
00:09:08.481 --> 00:09:09.241
and 6th of July,

153
00:09:09.241 --> 00:09:13.640
the 20 detachment was instructed to hold the crucial elementary crossroads or

154
00:09:13.641 --> 00:09:16.950
costs. They reduced to less than a hundred men after the beginning of the Soviet

155
00:09:17.430 --> 00:09:20.910
offensive. And they were about to face two regiments of the red army,

156
00:09:21.310 --> 00:09:25.030
a total of 4,000 enemy soldiers against all military logic.

157
00:09:25.630 --> 00:09:29.390
Larry split his men into even smaller units. Sure. They may have been weaker,

158
00:09:29.490 --> 00:09:33.150
but they were also highly mobile by shuttling back and forth between them.

159
00:09:33.510 --> 00:09:36.820
Larry was able to direct a Syria of counter attacks against the incoming

160
00:09:36.890 --> 00:09:37.381
Soviets,

161
00:09:37.381 --> 00:09:41.420
which were convinced they were facing a much larger force Tony's company,

162
00:09:41.421 --> 00:09:43.460
inflicted hundreds of losses on the red army,

163
00:09:43.610 --> 00:09:47.100
halting their advance and allowing for the bulk of the finished forces to

164
00:09:47.101 --> 00:09:48.020
retreat and regroup.

165
00:09:48.200 --> 00:09:51.740
It was a tactical masterpiece that achieved an important strategic result,

166
00:09:52.000 --> 00:09:54.780
but Larry did not have time to celebrate as once again,

167
00:09:55.340 --> 00:10:00.330
he onto a Soviet mine mark on voes learns that he had been made a nice of

168
00:10:00.331 --> 00:10:01.290
the cross of Manheim.

169
00:10:01.390 --> 00:10:04.570
The highest military decoration in the finish armed forces.

170
00:10:05.030 --> 00:10:09.850
It is estimated that a total of 600,000 fins served in the continuation war

171
00:10:10.450 --> 00:10:14.690
Buton 191 of them received such high military honor. The following month,

172
00:10:15.090 --> 00:10:17.040
he was promoted to captain at the same time,

173
00:10:17.360 --> 00:10:21.200
the Soviets had bestowed on Larry and even higher accolade propaganda radio

174
00:10:21.370 --> 00:10:25.720
broadcasts had issued a bounty on his head, dead or alive. The Soviets swept,

175
00:10:25.721 --> 00:10:27.760
willing to pay 3 million finish marks,

176
00:10:27.761 --> 00:10:32.320
which corresponds to more than half a million us dollars in today's money.

177
00:10:32.470 --> 00:10:35.440
It's a small fortune, especially during wartime yet.

178
00:10:35.580 --> 00:10:37.270
No one dead could like the reward.

179
00:10:37.750 --> 00:10:40.070
Larry and as men continued to fight in Carlia,

180
00:10:40.390 --> 00:10:41.630
but their commander inchi Marshall,

181
00:10:42.070 --> 00:10:45.390
and is now president Manheim was coming to terms with a harsh reality.

182
00:10:45.570 --> 00:10:48.350
The fights could not go on forever against the red steam roller,

183
00:10:48.480 --> 00:10:52.550
especially now that Germany and its allies were losing grounds on August the

184
00:10:52.551 --> 00:10:56.950
25th, 1944. The finished governments initiated secret talks with Mosco,

185
00:10:57.270 --> 00:11:00.500
which led to the signing of an Armas on September the 19th.

186
00:11:00.760 --> 00:11:04.860
The conditions while ensuring the survival of the nation were extremely harsh.

187
00:11:05.260 --> 00:11:09.540
Finland had a seed back 10% of its territory, including Carol and VII.

188
00:11:09.730 --> 00:11:13.700
PSIN also had to pay war reparations to Moscow equivalents to almost four,

189
00:11:13.780 --> 00:11:17.020
a half billion us dollars in today's money. And if that wasn't enough,

190
00:11:17.200 --> 00:11:21.970
man Heim was forced to demobilize most of his army and to expel any remaining

191
00:11:22.170 --> 00:11:24.050
ver marked units from finished territory.

192
00:11:24.120 --> 00:11:28.970
This became known as the Lapland war one in which low did not take part

193
00:11:29.230 --> 00:11:32.250
as he had been demobilized. Once again, low Toney,

194
00:11:32.390 --> 00:11:36.490
wasn't prepared to yield Emitt the wreckage of another unfair defeat,

195
00:11:36.680 --> 00:11:39.600
like the mythical Phoenix rising from its own ashes.

196
00:11:39.780 --> 00:11:43.800
He was eager to continue the fight against the Soviets whose peace treaty.

197
00:11:44.060 --> 00:11:48.800
He just did not trust alongside other demobilized troops Lowry fled to Hamburg

198
00:11:49.020 --> 00:11:53.600
in a UBO to resume special operations training in a often SS facility.

199
00:11:53.960 --> 00:11:56.200
And Linberg along the BTIC coast.

200
00:11:56.720 --> 00:11:59.120
He Lari perfected his approach to asymmetric warfare,

201
00:11:59.230 --> 00:12:02.120
including sabotage techniques, explosives handling,

202
00:12:02.140 --> 00:12:05.200
and deep reconnaissance tactics. Unfortunately for Tony,

203
00:12:05.380 --> 00:12:09.040
the program was halted after a few weeks of training because the red army was

204
00:12:09.041 --> 00:12:10.200
making its way towards Berlin.

205
00:12:10.420 --> 00:12:13.470
The mark was in desperate need of about ready troops.

206
00:12:13.471 --> 00:12:15.590
And so captain Dony was drafted.

207
00:12:15.730 --> 00:12:18.110
He was tasked with leading a Naval infantry company,

208
00:12:18.111 --> 00:12:20.870
deployed east of Berlin facing once more,

209
00:12:20.970 --> 00:12:25.190
the invader of his homelands toy for valiantly against the incoming enemies.

210
00:12:25.290 --> 00:12:26.050
But once again,

211
00:12:26.050 --> 00:12:30.630
his tactical victories could not overcome the Soviet's overwhelming numerical

212
00:12:30.830 --> 00:12:34.060
superiority facing inevitable capture a by the Soviets,

213
00:12:34.061 --> 00:12:36.180
which would've meant almost certain death.

214
00:12:36.660 --> 00:12:40.300
Tony instead sought to turn himself in as a prisoner to the British unit,

215
00:12:40.301 --> 00:12:42.180
which had landed nearby airfield.

216
00:12:42.520 --> 00:12:45.380
His bet paid off and the British did not kill him on site.

217
00:12:45.520 --> 00:12:49.780
He was sent instead to a P O w camp in Belgium and then transferred to lube in

218
00:12:49.781 --> 00:12:54.610
Germany life as a British prisoner was surely better than living as an inmate

219
00:12:54.710 --> 00:12:55.543
in a Guag.

220
00:12:55.810 --> 00:12:59.330
But rumors started spreading that the Western allies were transferring some of

221
00:12:59.331 --> 00:13:00.930
their POWs to the Soviets.

222
00:13:01.290 --> 00:13:04.170
Tony was not going to risk that he partnered with fellow fin,

223
00:13:04.730 --> 00:13:07.810
sooo Corella and escaped from the camp in July of 1945.

224
00:13:08.030 --> 00:13:10.650
The circumstances of how they did it are not clear.

225
00:13:10.720 --> 00:13:15.320
What is documented is that they posed as former prisoners of the ver mark to hit

226
00:13:15.400 --> 00:13:16.960
a ride from a British army captain.

227
00:13:17.090 --> 00:13:21.120
Eventually they reached Copenhagen and secured travel visas from the finished

228
00:13:21.121 --> 00:13:25.840
consulate Lowry toy had emerged from the ruins of Thery and was finally heading

229
00:13:25.950 --> 00:13:28.960
home. But what he received was not a heroes welcome.

230
00:13:29.340 --> 00:13:31.240
And just before we continue with today's video,

231
00:13:31.460 --> 00:13:33.800

Vietnam war. It's called Vietnam war hidden traces.

things like unexploded bombs that were left behind.

254
00:14:50.380 --> 00:14:52.920
And speaking of that, let's get back to it.

255
00:14:59.230 --> 00:15:01.840
When Larry returns to Finland in August, 1945,

256
00:15:01.841 --> 00:15:05.200
he was almost immediately prosecuted for treason by the Valpo,

257
00:15:05.220 --> 00:15:08.320
the finished state police, technically they were not wrong.

258
00:15:08.720 --> 00:15:12.430
Tony had escaped a Hamburg and joined of the VE mark during the Lapland war.

259
00:15:12.690 --> 00:15:15.470
In other words, he has essentially defected to the enemy.

260
00:15:15.690 --> 00:15:19.590
The situation was complicated by Finland's delicate position between the end of

261
00:15:19.591 --> 00:15:23.230
world war II and the start of the cold war while the red army could have invaded

262
00:15:23.330 --> 00:15:25.990
yet again, as it had done with almost all of Eastern Europe,

263
00:15:26.370 --> 00:15:29.070
Stalin actually preferred a less aggressive approach.

264
00:15:29.370 --> 00:15:32.500
He demanded instead Phil inland remain a neutral country,

265
00:15:32.720 --> 00:15:36.700
but under a strong Soviet influence, it was a Shrew strategic move.

266
00:15:36.701 --> 00:15:40.180
As it would prevent NATO from deploying future troops along the Soviet finished

267
00:15:40.181 --> 00:15:40.840
border.

268
00:15:40.840 --> 00:15:45.060
One of the longest sanctions of the Soviet union's borders Moscow's influence

269
00:15:45.580 --> 00:15:49.100
extended to the appointments of ministers and officials aligned to the communist

270
00:15:49.101 --> 00:15:53.890
party. And one of them was the chief of the Valpo. Anyway, in August of 1945,

271
00:15:53.960 --> 00:15:58.250
Tony had been arrested for treason and was placed on a train headed to a high

272
00:15:58.450 --> 00:16:01.330
security prison. Lonnie did not wait for the term to begin.

273
00:16:01.350 --> 00:16:05.170
He simply jumped off the train during a stop for the next few months,

274
00:16:05.570 --> 00:16:08.410
Larry reunited with his beloved parents and his sister Caja.

275
00:16:08.730 --> 00:16:12.280
There had been forcibly relocated from Vapo to hell sinky year.

276
00:16:12.281 --> 00:16:15.520
He worked at an electrical supply firm and generally lived in the open.

277
00:16:15.740 --> 00:16:20.200
He enjoyed the simple pleasures of life as a free and innocent man. However,

278
00:16:20.250 --> 00:16:22.320
after a coworker reported him to the Valpo,

279
00:16:22.321 --> 00:16:26.520
the former officer was apprehended once more a trial in October of 1946,

280
00:16:26.521 --> 00:16:30.200
sentenced him to six years in prison for high treason. Once again,

281
00:16:30.260 --> 00:16:34.790
the only way out of that sticky situation was to, well just leave.

282
00:16:35.060 --> 00:16:39.270
Tony certainly was no stranger to evasions. So in the spring of 1947,

283
00:16:39.271 --> 00:16:43.630
he simply walked out of jail. Thanks to a false ID card smuggled in by a friend,

284
00:16:43.890 --> 00:16:47.550
his life as a fugitive didn't last long though, as the Valpo had an as OMP,

285
00:16:47.670 --> 00:16:48.170
their sleeve,

286
00:16:48.170 --> 00:16:52.110
the police spread the false rumor that he was wanted for theft a blemish on his

287
00:16:52.220 --> 00:16:56.060
upright reput that Tony could not tolerate, willing to clear his record.

288
00:16:56.200 --> 00:17:01.100
He handed himself over voluntarily and returned to behind bars at tur state

289
00:17:01.101 --> 00:17:01.560
prison,

290
00:17:01.560 --> 00:17:05.340
but it wasn't long before the restless captain was ready to attempt another

291
00:17:05.360 --> 00:17:07.180
escape while generally a quiet man.

292
00:17:07.460 --> 00:17:10.060
Larry could make a quite gen and cultured companion.

293
00:17:10.061 --> 00:17:14.570
He made friends with theist and service at the prison church while serving as

294
00:17:14.571 --> 00:17:15.211
his assistant,

295
00:17:15.211 --> 00:17:19.290
he identified a poorly secured window in the chapel from which he believed he

296
00:17:19.291 --> 00:17:21.130
could escape with a classic tactic,

297
00:17:21.450 --> 00:17:25.330
a rope made of bedsheets tied to an iron hook, but on the nights of the escape,

298
00:17:25.370 --> 00:17:29.450
a guard discovered him and took him with his rifle ready to end this indomitable

299
00:17:29.451 --> 00:17:30.280
soldier's career.

300
00:17:30.280 --> 00:17:33.690
Luckily the gun malfunctions and toy was apprehended without serious.

301
00:17:33.970 --> 00:17:35.360
And by the end of the decade,

302
00:17:35.540 --> 00:17:38.880
the Soviet script on the finished government had loosened enough for the

303
00:17:38.881 --> 00:17:42.920
presidents to issue a pardon for 20. Unfortunately the pardon involved,

304
00:17:43.200 --> 00:17:44.560
his being stripped of his rank.

305
00:17:44.740 --> 00:17:49.040
His name was removed from official war records to the date was October the

306
00:17:49.280 --> 00:17:50.113
sixth, 1950.

307
00:17:50.520 --> 00:17:53.600
Larry felt betrayed and he wasn't sure that there was anything else he could

308
00:17:53.601 --> 00:17:56.040
offer his own country. So in 1949,

309
00:17:56.041 --> 00:17:59.400
he decided to immigrate crossing the border into Sweden here.

310
00:17:59.540 --> 00:18:03.920
He started a new life as a lumberjack. He started dating a girl from Stockholm,

311
00:18:04.400 --> 00:18:07.080
Maya cops, the first and only real love of his life.

312
00:18:07.140 --> 00:18:11.670
The two got engaged on near the first 1950 and had even set a date for their

313
00:18:11.671 --> 00:18:12.050
wedding.

314
00:18:12.050 --> 00:18:15.830
The two had agreed that Larry would wear his old captain's uniform for the

315
00:18:15.831 --> 00:18:19.630
wedding photo shoot. So the girl traveled to Finland to collect it, but fate,

316
00:18:19.950 --> 00:18:20.830
through a spanner in the works,

317
00:18:21.310 --> 00:18:24.630
Larry had previously applied for a visa to travel to Venezuela under the alias

318
00:18:24.631 --> 00:18:25.630
of Emma Meki.

319
00:18:25.690 --> 00:18:30.380
His intention was to join community of Finnish Aban in the Americas and start a

320
00:18:30.381 --> 00:18:34.420
new life. After months of waiting, the visa had finally arrived. Unfortunately,

321
00:18:34.421 --> 00:18:39.180
this offered only a very limited time window for LA to leave Sweden and so toy.

322
00:18:39.780 --> 00:18:40.480
Well, he was torn.

323
00:18:40.480 --> 00:18:44.180
He was torn between his new love and the opportunity to start a new life away

324
00:18:44.181 --> 00:18:48.020
from Europe. In the end, he opted to leave before Maya could return.

325
00:18:48.580 --> 00:18:50.570
Larry got in touch and probably a story would be back,

326
00:18:50.630 --> 00:18:52.450
but their connection waned over the years,

327
00:18:52.500 --> 00:18:57.250
eventually Maya moved Toles Palm to marry a Spanish man down in south America,

328
00:18:57.650 --> 00:18:59.650
lower landed in Caracas in March of 1950,

329
00:18:59.651 --> 00:19:03.610
taking on odd jobs around the local finish community to make ends meet among

330
00:19:03.611 --> 00:19:06.690
these jobs low would work as a babysitter for his compatriots.

331
00:19:06.990 --> 00:19:11.520
And that is a pretty interesting change of career w SS captain

332
00:19:11.590 --> 00:19:16.000
special forces operator looking after young children. How about that?

333
00:19:16.300 --> 00:19:20.800
Beyond babysitting a job more suited to Larry was as a sailor Ron merchant ship

334
00:19:20.801 --> 00:19:24.840
sailing to the us. The Finn had since long set of sight on moving to the us,

335
00:19:25.020 --> 00:19:28.880
but the status of his visa did not allow him to step off the boat onto dry

336
00:19:28.970 --> 00:19:30.200
lands. But a man like Tony,

337
00:19:30.730 --> 00:19:35.150
not less a little paperwork get in his way by now an escape artist on par with a

338
00:19:35.151 --> 00:19:35.984
great Houdini.

339
00:19:36.310 --> 00:19:40.470
Larry simply jumped overboards off the coast of Louisiana and swam safely as to

340
00:19:40.471 --> 00:19:44.230
new Orleans from there. Larry made his way to New York where settled in Harlem,

341
00:19:44.590 --> 00:19:47.230
resuming his routine of odd jobs. By 1951,

342
00:19:47.590 --> 00:19:51.340
Larry had been apprehended by the FBI. He was an illegal immigrants after rule,

343
00:19:51.341 --> 00:19:54.420
and it was only a matter of time before he would be kicked outta the country.

344
00:19:54.650 --> 00:19:58.460
Luckily in New York, Tony had become friends with one parvo Fleming.

345
00:19:58.461 --> 00:20:02.300
This gentleman was the president of an association of finished veterans and

346
00:20:02.301 --> 00:20:03.620
soldiers in the us.

347
00:20:04.040 --> 00:20:08.180
And he had immediately recognized the great potential that Larry could offer to

348
00:20:08.181 --> 00:20:11.420
the us armed forces. Fleming had brought Larry's case to the,

349
00:20:12.090 --> 00:20:17.090
of retired general William wild bill Donovan key figure within the OSS and

350
00:20:17.140 --> 00:20:18.330
later the CIA.

351
00:20:18.870 --> 00:20:23.050
Now an attorney Donovan agreed to represent Toney and was able to secure him a

352
00:20:23.051 --> 00:20:25.810
permit to remain in the United States. Not only that,

353
00:20:25.910 --> 00:20:28.610
but he interceded for him to be enrolled in the us army.

354
00:20:28.840 --> 00:20:33.240
This is when Laurie Toney reemerged as Larry Allen thorn legend

355
00:20:33.660 --> 00:20:34.840
of the green Berets

356
00:20:41.260 --> 00:20:45.760
In January, 1954, former captain 20 started basic training at Fort,

357
00:20:46.160 --> 00:20:48.760
New Jersey as private thorn. While there,

358
00:20:48.761 --> 00:20:50.240
it must have been a strange experience.

359
00:20:50.340 --> 00:20:53.960
He was 34 years old while the average age of soldiers was 19.

360
00:20:54.100 --> 00:20:55.640
He had the inclination to lead,

361
00:20:55.700 --> 00:20:58.480
but also had to retrain as a low ranking soldier.

362
00:20:58.740 --> 00:21:01.040
His English was also not really up to scratch,

363
00:21:01.140 --> 00:21:05.320
but he did manage to communicate at least in part with a blend of hand gestures

364
00:21:05.321 --> 00:21:08.350
and shouted profound. After completing basic training,

365
00:21:08.370 --> 00:21:11.070
he attended two specialization courses. First,

366
00:21:11.071 --> 00:21:13.870
there was the mountain and a cold weather survival course,

367
00:21:13.871 --> 00:21:16.670
which must have felt like any other Tuesday to him.

368
00:21:16.671 --> 00:21:20.030
There was also the para course for Bening, Georgia, which,

369
00:21:20.350 --> 00:21:22.630
and in may halo certificate in 1957,

370
00:21:22.680 --> 00:21:26.630
Larry was serving in BAV as a member of the 11th airborne division.

371
00:21:27.020 --> 00:21:30.540
He had performed well in the us military climbing up to the rank of first left

372
00:21:30.740 --> 00:21:33.380
tenant. However, following several months of relative quiet,

373
00:21:33.760 --> 00:21:36.740
he got into serious trouble in December, 1958,

374
00:21:37.020 --> 00:21:40.100
th thorn was involved in a pub rule with some locals fist fight,

375
00:21:40.101 --> 00:21:44.180
which ended in his throwing several Bavarian patrons through a plate glass

376
00:21:44.181 --> 00:21:46.860
window. Larry was arrested and caught martialed.

377
00:21:47.220 --> 00:21:51.530
He sir risked his own dismissal from the army. That luck was on his side.

378
00:21:51.531 --> 00:21:55.010
Investigators found that some of the Germans involved in the rule had a criminal

379
00:21:55.011 --> 00:21:59.010
record and at least two of them were bonded by the police at Thorn's court

380
00:21:59.210 --> 00:22:01.930
martial. In October, 1959, he was found not guilty.

381
00:22:02.570 --> 00:22:03.610
Th thorn could have returned to his duties,

382
00:22:03.670 --> 00:22:07.530
but he preferred to accept a transfer instead to the 10th group of the special

383
00:22:07.531 --> 00:22:11.040
forces, the green Berets based in bar dolls in Germany.

384
00:22:11.340 --> 00:22:15.840
It was with this team that in July of 1962 Lowry took part in one of his best

385
00:22:16.160 --> 00:22:16.820
known missions.

386
00:22:16.820 --> 00:22:20.320
His unit was tasked with retrieving the wreckage of an auto reconnaissance

387
00:22:20.370 --> 00:22:20.940
plane.

388
00:22:20.940 --> 00:22:24.800
The aircraft had crashed of the Zagros mountains in Iran after a secret missions

389
00:22:24.920 --> 00:22:28.280
to gather Intel on Larry thorns old nemesis, the Soviet union,

390
00:22:28.570 --> 00:22:32.030
two previous crews of German mountain near troops that failed to locate the OT,

391
00:22:32.031 --> 00:22:35.830
which contained information too sensitive to be left unattended on a mountaintop

392
00:22:35.831 --> 00:22:37.670
under the leadership of captain Chandler,

393
00:22:37.680 --> 00:22:41.670
Larry and a dozen green Berets climbed the unforgiving terrain of the Zagros

394
00:22:41.671 --> 00:22:43.830
range and succeeded in reaching the wreckage.

395
00:22:43.860 --> 00:22:47.350
They retrieved the classified Intel as well as the bodies of the airmen who had

396
00:22:47.351 --> 00:22:48.910
died in the crash along the way.

397
00:22:49.060 --> 00:22:52.500
Larry and his friends even found time to provide medical aid to isolated

398
00:22:52.501 --> 00:22:55.100
communities on the mountains. In early 1963,

399
00:22:55.620 --> 00:22:59.500
Lieutenant thorn was assigned a mission in south Vietnam as a military advisor.

400
00:22:59.640 --> 00:23:02.420
His job was to work with the south Vietnamese special forces,

401
00:23:02.510 --> 00:23:06.620
which he led in several airborne missions on one such assignment thorn,

402
00:23:06.680 --> 00:23:11.410
his Sergeant and 10 south of Vietnamese militia were ambushed by 120

403
00:23:11.730 --> 00:23:15.330
via con Larry's dirty dozen soundly defeated the gorillas.

404
00:23:15.390 --> 00:23:19.570
And he was awarded a bronze star after this first tour in Vietnam that now

405
00:23:19.571 --> 00:23:23.570
captain thorn returned to Fort Benning for more advanced training after which he

406
00:23:23.571 --> 00:23:28.530
was ordered to do a second tour in Vietnam during the spring and summer of 1965,

407
00:23:28.740 --> 00:23:33.320
thorn was working at the special forces group headquarters at Nareg as an

408
00:23:33.321 --> 00:23:36.400
intelligence officer, it was mainly a quieted job,

409
00:23:36.500 --> 00:23:40.720
but surprisingly he liked it and was soon recognized as the leader of Narans

410
00:23:40.721 --> 00:23:42.680
intelligence operations in late June,

411
00:23:42.700 --> 00:23:44.520
the base came under a attack from the via con,

412
00:23:44.521 --> 00:23:46.720
but the gorillas did not achieve the intended pal.

413
00:23:47.030 --> 00:23:49.160
This was thanks to Thorn's intelligence work,

414
00:23:49.170 --> 00:23:53.560
which had enabled the prompt response of defense elements stated by his

415
00:23:53.561 --> 00:23:55.840
commanding officer in an after action report.

416
00:23:56.020 --> 00:23:59.840
It was also thanks to this success that Larry was assigned to lead operations

417
00:23:59.870 --> 00:24:01.440
shining brass in September.

418
00:24:01.710 --> 00:24:05.510
This was a secret infiltration of reconnaissance element into Lao,

419
00:24:06.270 --> 00:24:10.430
formerly neutral country. On October the 18th, 1965, Larry thorn boarded,

420
00:24:10.431 --> 00:24:12.750
a helicopter with south Vietnamese operatives,

421
00:24:12.990 --> 00:24:16.430
a photo taken that day depicted him as he gets to the chopper.

422
00:24:16.660 --> 00:24:21.630
This was the last photo ever taken of captain Lori Toney reborn in

423
00:24:21.631 --> 00:24:23.670
the west as captain Larry thorn.

424
00:24:23.810 --> 00:24:27.460
The objective of the mission were to pinpoint the location of communist troop

425
00:24:27.461 --> 00:24:30.860
encampments. From that perspective, Larry had scored another success.

426
00:24:31.000 --> 00:24:35.700
His team did locate the enemy base and the us dropped 95 tons of bombs on it.

427
00:24:35.720 --> 00:24:38.540
Two weeks later. However, during the flight itself,

428
00:24:38.900 --> 00:24:42.420
Michigan control lost all contact with Thorn's helicopter and he and his

429
00:24:42.421 --> 00:24:46.410
comrades were declared missing in action. Exactly. One later on October,

430
00:24:46.411 --> 00:24:49.930
the 19th, 1966, they were all declared killed in action,

431
00:24:50.410 --> 00:24:54.170
although neither their bodies nor the helicopter were ever located during the

432
00:24:54.171 --> 00:24:56.330
remaining years of the Vietnam conflict.

433
00:24:56.630 --> 00:24:59.010
So did he actually die in a helicopter crash?

434
00:24:59.230 --> 00:25:02.930
Had he been captured by the via or by the north Vietnamese army?

435
00:25:03.190 --> 00:25:07.280
Had he resurfaced again in another country with ready to fight another war?

436
00:25:07.880 --> 00:25:11.640
Well, it took more than 30 years to solve the mystery. In 1999,

437
00:25:11.660 --> 00:25:16.240
thorns remains were found 25 miles south of Ang by a joint finished us task

438
00:25:16.600 --> 00:25:20.760
force. He was repatriated to America, formally identified in 2003.

439
00:25:20.900 --> 00:25:25.800
His remains were buried on June the 26th, 2003 at Arlington national cemetery,

440
00:25:25.801 --> 00:25:29.630
section 60 tombstone, 8,136.

441
00:25:29.810 --> 00:25:34.030
He was buried alongside the remaining south Vietnam air force casualties from

442
00:25:34.031 --> 00:25:34.864
his final mission

443
00:25:40.930 --> 00:25:42.350
In his 47 years of life.

444
00:25:42.710 --> 00:25:46.950
Larry Toney had fought in three different wars on behalf of three completely D

445
00:25:47.090 --> 00:25:50.900
countries. All of which bestowed upon him, praise for his valor.

446
00:25:50.960 --> 00:25:55.220
He could proudly wear 17 military decorations, including the Manheim cross,

447
00:25:55.520 --> 00:25:59.780
the iron cross, a distinguished flying cross and a bronze star to this day.

448
00:26:00.060 --> 00:26:02.060
Us special forces have an award named after him.

449
00:26:02.300 --> 00:26:04.260
A former Comrad from the Vietnam war.

450
00:26:04.500 --> 00:26:09.090
Robin Moore took inspiration from Toney for the character of spend corny in his

451
00:26:09.091 --> 00:26:10.330
book. The green Berets,

452
00:26:10.480 --> 00:26:14.130
this was later turned into a movie where the corny character would be

453
00:26:14.160 --> 00:26:18.690
interpreted by the duke himself, John Wayne. And in 2014,

454
00:26:19.050 --> 00:26:22.090
Larry was celebrated by metal band Sabo on in their song,

455
00:26:22.160 --> 00:26:23.730
soldier of three armies.

456
00:26:23.990 --> 00:26:26.810
If you want to know more about the crazy life of this character,

457
00:26:26.890 --> 00:26:31.360
I can recommend the books born a soldier by Mike cleverly and soldier under

458
00:26:31.370 --> 00:26:33.600
three flags by Henry A. Gill.

459
00:26:33.780 --> 00:26:37.320
Of course not everybody agrees with his hero status, Finn authors,

460
00:26:37.720 --> 00:26:40.360
Juha Poonan and ULA silver OAN in their book.

461
00:26:40.390 --> 00:26:43.640
Unknown Lori 20 suggests that at the end of world war II,

462
00:26:43.641 --> 00:26:47.560
the fin had joined a Nazi resistance movements with the purpose of carrying out,

463
00:26:47.840 --> 00:26:51.880
say national socialist coup in Finlands. The book is available only in finish,

464
00:26:51.940 --> 00:26:55.560
but we'll leave a link to the ebook in the description in case you speak that

465
00:26:55.800 --> 00:26:58.680
language controversy aside, I really do hope you enjoy today's video.
