00:00:14.801 --> 00:00:15.634
a bit.

7
00:00:21.090 --> 00:00:22.110
In 1922,

8
00:00:22.111 --> 00:00:26.350
Harry Truman sat in his mother-in-law's house in a small town in Missouri

9
00:00:26.500 --> 00:00:29.310
contemplating the failure that had been his life.

10
00:00:29.490 --> 00:00:34.150
He was nearly 40 and behind him lay a string of failed businesses and

11
00:00:34.270 --> 00:00:35.670
unfulfilling odd jobs.

12
00:00:35.930 --> 00:00:40.470
He was close to bankrupts deeply in debt and looked down upon by his wife's

13
00:00:40.471 --> 00:00:43.460
elitist family. Aside from a Bri St ins in the army,

14
00:00:43.520 --> 00:00:47.980
he had never lived outside his one horse town. He was in short,

15
00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:49.333
a bit of a laser,

16
00:00:49.780 --> 00:00:54.700
a man who had failed at life so thoroughly that even John Arbuckle would appear

17
00:00:54.800 --> 00:00:57.620
as an overachieving Hercules next to him.

18
00:00:57.800 --> 00:01:01.300
And yet Truman's luck was about to change in a quarter century.

19
00:01:01.750 --> 00:01:06.450
He would go from small town, nobody to leader of the free world,

20
00:01:07.090 --> 00:01:08.450
another quarter of a century after that.

21
00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:13.090
And he'd be recognized as one of the greatest presidents in American history.

22
00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:15.610
So how did this happen? How did a man,

23
00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:20.450
so singularly unambitious wind up achieving so many remarkable

24
00:01:20.451 --> 00:01:21.120
things.

25
00:01:21.120 --> 00:01:25.520
Well in today's biographics we are charting these strange and

26
00:01:25.521 --> 00:01:28.160
unexpected rise of Hart, Truman.

27
00:01:28.760 --> 00:01:31.080
The nobody who became a, somebody,

28
00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:37.721
You know,

29
00:01:37.721 --> 00:01:41.480
that old saying some are born to greatness while others have greatness thrust

30
00:01:41.550 --> 00:01:42.480
upon them. Well, I,

31
00:01:42.550 --> 00:01:46.710
Harry Truman definitely falls into the latter category born on may the eighth,

32
00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:47.530
1884.

33
00:01:47.530 --> 00:01:51.910
Truman was a poor country boy through and through his parents were a farming

34
00:01:52.430 --> 00:01:55.070
stock, scraping a living on the edge of the American frontier.

35
00:01:55.420 --> 00:01:59.790
When Truman was aged just six, his family moved to independence, Missouri,

36
00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:04.860
small town on the banks of the river that acted gateway to the American west.

37
00:02:05.160 --> 00:02:09.740
It was in independence that the railroads terminated that the wagon trains set

38
00:02:09.760 --> 00:02:11.260
off, even in 1890,

39
00:02:11.261 --> 00:02:15.100
people still had living memories of the settlers who had come through here

40
00:02:15.250 --> 00:02:17.140
seeking goals and freedom.

41
00:02:17.410 --> 00:02:22.300
<v 1>They also had living memories of an altogether more controversial time when</v>

42
00:02:22.301 --> 00:02:26.170
independence was settled, it was mostly by families from the south.

43
00:02:26.350 --> 00:02:31.130
The town was racially segregated and veterans who'd fought for the Confederacy w

44
00:02:31.130 --> 00:02:33.970
as still kicking around like many growing up at that time,

45
00:02:34.110 --> 00:02:38.810
Truman absorbed the prejudices that these men carried for the rest of his life h

46
00:02:38.810 --> 00:02:40.810
ad freely used racial slurs in private.

47
00:02:41.070 --> 00:02:44.800
<v 0>But if his fellow Missourians thought Truman was just good old boy,</v>

48
00:02:45.480 --> 00:02:49.240
they'd be in for a shock. When he finally reached high office, as he grew up,

49
00:02:49.760 --> 00:02:52.040
Truman went through all the usual pain we experienced.

50
00:02:52.041 --> 00:02:56.640
He was often shy around girls and sometimes found it hard to befriend other

51
00:02:56.641 --> 00:03:00.880
boys, but Truman's childhood came with an additional dose of misery, age 10.

52
00:03:00.900 --> 00:03:04.560
He contracted diptheria and spent the best part of a year with his arms,

53
00:03:04.950 --> 00:03:07.960
legs and throat paralyzed. By the time he recovered,

54
00:03:07.980 --> 00:03:12.240
the frail near sighted boy had lost whatever interest had held in the outside

55
00:03:12.241 --> 00:03:16.960
world. The rest of Truman's early passed in a steady flow of disappointments.

56
00:03:17.020 --> 00:03:20.150
He tried to become a concert, but he lacked the drive.

57
00:03:20.151 --> 00:03:22.350
He applied to west point to join the military,

58
00:03:22.351 --> 00:03:24.230
but his poor eyesight excluded him.

59
00:03:24.450 --> 00:03:27.750
He enrolled in a Kansas city business college after high school,

60
00:03:28.110 --> 00:03:31.630
but family problems forced him to drop out after just a single term,

61
00:03:31.900 --> 00:03:35.150
back in independence, his father's farm was refusing to turn a profit.

62
00:03:35.250 --> 00:03:39.980
So Truman dutifully gave up on his dreams and went back to Zu to help his

63
00:03:40.040 --> 00:03:43.340
par out. He'd stay on that farm for the next 80 years.

64
00:03:43.530 --> 00:03:48.140
Perhaps the one gleam of light in these trying times was Truman's

65
00:03:48.141 --> 00:03:51.260
relationship with his high school sweetheart, be Wallace,

66
00:03:51.640 --> 00:03:54.260
but even that and sour Wallace's family,

67
00:03:54.330 --> 00:03:57.100
they disapproved of Truman's backgrounds. When he proposed,

68
00:03:57.680 --> 00:04:01.890
she rejected him come 19 seven Truman was a guy he's so used to getting beat

69
00:04:01.891 --> 00:04:04.890
down by life. That it's a wonder he got out of bed in the morning.

70
00:04:05.190 --> 00:04:07.970
So what saved him? What wild events,

71
00:04:08.250 --> 00:04:12.810
PL Harry Truman out of obscurity and set him on the path to greatness for that.

72
00:04:13.190 --> 00:04:17.410
You can thank the wildest event of the mall on January the 19th,

73
00:04:17.770 --> 00:04:22.280
1917 German high command sent a to Mexico known as the Zimerman

74
00:04:22.281 --> 00:04:26.760
telegram. It asked Mexico to join world war. I by attacking the USA,

75
00:04:27.060 --> 00:04:29.800
not being idiots, the Mexicans replied, uh,

76
00:04:30.700 --> 00:04:33.920
no and alerted Washington do Berlin's absurd plan.

77
00:04:34.100 --> 00:04:37.720
It was the beginning of the United States as slow entry to world war I or war

78
00:04:37.721 --> 00:04:41.590
that would ultimately kill over a hundred and thousand Americans.

79
00:04:41.930 --> 00:04:46.030
It was also Harry Truman's ticket to finally escaping small town Missouri

80
00:04:52.490 --> 00:04:56.710
In late 1917 Truman's national guard unit was called up for basic training just

81
00:04:56.711 --> 00:04:57.910
before he left Truman guard,

82
00:04:57.990 --> 00:05:02.380
a hastily scrolled message from a heartbroken best Wallace as saying she wanted

83
00:05:02.381 --> 00:05:07.060
to marry him after all Truman's response was as plain as his appearance.

84
00:05:07.500 --> 00:05:10.340
I don't think it would be right for me to ask you to tie yourself to a

85
00:05:10.341 --> 00:05:13.500
prospective cripple or a sentiment. And with that,

86
00:05:13.800 --> 00:05:17.020
his unit left Missouri military life suited Truman.

87
00:05:17.080 --> 00:05:20.820
<v 1>He was promoted to captain and took great pride in running the best canteen in</v>

88
00:05:20.821 --> 00:05:21.654
his regiments.

89
00:05:21.750 --> 00:05:25.410
But if you are expecting to hear that Truman just stayed behind the lines and

90
00:05:25.411 --> 00:05:28.210
didn't see action. Well prepare to be impressed.

91
00:05:28.670 --> 00:05:30.930
The unit shipped house in March, 1918,

92
00:05:30.960 --> 00:05:34.250
that August Treeman was thrown headlong into the meat grinder.

93
00:05:34.320 --> 00:05:37.130
That was the Western front through September and into October.

94
00:05:37.310 --> 00:05:39.330
He fought in the bloody mus Sagon offensive.

95
00:05:39.590 --> 00:05:42.560
<v 0>The only future president to see action, great war.</v>

96
00:05:42.630 --> 00:05:44.120
When he emerged on the other side,

97
00:05:44.240 --> 00:05:48.800
miraculously unscathed Truman had gained his first experience leading men.

98
00:05:48.940 --> 00:05:53.640
He also gained a friendship with a soldier named Pendergast little did Truman

99
00:05:53.641 --> 00:05:56.960
know it, but his connection to Pendergast was going to change his life.

100
00:05:57.180 --> 00:06:01.360
Truman finally made it back to Missouri in may 19, 19 1 month later,

101
00:06:01.380 --> 00:06:03.000
he took be Wallace up on ARA.

102
00:06:03.300 --> 00:06:06.600
And the two of them got married no long after Truman opened a men's clothing

103
00:06:06.650 --> 00:06:10.440
store in Kansas city. It should have been the end of his adventures,

104
00:06:11.080 --> 00:06:14.040
little projects occupy his postwar years,

105
00:06:14.540 --> 00:06:17.590
but there was no such luck into January, 1920,

106
00:06:17.690 --> 00:06:22.310
the sharpest deepest depression in living memory wall up America wholesale

107
00:06:22.330 --> 00:06:26.630
prices plummeted 37% while the us was gripped by the worst single year.

108
00:06:26.660 --> 00:06:31.470
Deflation on record business failures skyrocketed one of those failed

109
00:06:31.710 --> 00:06:36.590
businesses was Truman's clothing store in 1922 deeply in debt Truman closed

110
00:06:36.591 --> 00:06:37.460
the for good.

111
00:06:37.650 --> 00:06:41.660
Then he bear moved in with the parents who never missed an opportunity to remind

112
00:06:41.661 --> 00:06:42.780
treatment of his failings.

113
00:06:43.010 --> 00:06:47.620
This is the moments we opened with the moments when Harry Truman aged nearly 40

114
00:06:47.930 --> 00:06:51.860
took stock of his life and realized it had accounted to nothing. However,

115
00:06:52.410 --> 00:06:55.420
fate was about to come knocking over in Kansas city.

116
00:06:55.600 --> 00:06:59.730
Tom Pendergast was looking for, for fresh meat for his political machine.

117
00:06:59.950 --> 00:07:03.930
The uncle of Truman's wartime buddy Pendagost was also the city's democratic

118
00:07:04.080 --> 00:07:08.250
boss. A guy who'd corrupted the entire state with his ruthless machinations,

119
00:07:08.510 --> 00:07:09.610
but while he was corrupted,

120
00:07:09.640 --> 00:07:14.490
Pendagost also liked to use men who were personally honest to give himself some

121
00:07:14.491 --> 00:07:19.320
cover men like his nephews, world war I buddy Harry, a Truman that same year,

122
00:07:19.380 --> 00:07:22.080
Tom Pendergast contacted Truman and made him an author.

123
00:07:22.460 --> 00:07:24.360
We don't know the exact terms,

124
00:07:24.500 --> 00:07:28.000
but we do know that Truman was suddenly installed as the local judge of east

125
00:07:28.001 --> 00:07:29.800
Jackson county. From there,

126
00:07:29.820 --> 00:07:33.800
the future president set about awarding fat contracts to Pendagost allies.

127
00:07:33.900 --> 00:07:37.280
But while Truman's time with Pendagost was certainly dodgy.

128
00:07:37.580 --> 00:07:40.910
It wasn't corrupt. Although he played the game and did,

129
00:07:40.930 --> 00:07:45.310
as his boss asked Truman also took his new job seriously on Truman's watch.

130
00:07:45.311 --> 00:07:49.550
Local government in Jackson county became more efficient. It wasted less money.

131
00:07:49.650 --> 00:07:54.390
Truman himself was scrupulously honest just as Pendagost had hoped. In fact,

132
00:07:54.391 --> 00:07:58.910
Truman was such a good little car in the Pendagost machine that come 1930

133
00:07:59.150 --> 00:08:00.700
Pendergast was ready to promote him.

134
00:08:00.880 --> 00:08:05.340
He asked the former farmer how it feel about becoming a Senator, just like that.

135
00:08:05.341 --> 00:08:08.220
Harry Truman found himself on his way to Congress.

136
00:08:14.890 --> 00:08:18.860
When Truman arrived in Washington on the 31st of December, 1934,

137
00:08:19.080 --> 00:08:21.610
his asked did not go unnoticed.

138
00:08:21.820 --> 00:08:25.650
Pendergast goons had stuffed ballot boxes to get Truman through his Senate

139
00:08:25.651 --> 00:08:27.450
primary. And it was widely thought.

140
00:08:27.451 --> 00:08:30.530
The new Senate was just a puppet of the Kansas city boss.

141
00:08:30.910 --> 00:08:34.650
Indeed Truman's nickname on Capitol hill was the Senator from Pendergast,

142
00:08:34.750 --> 00:08:39.010
but Truman refused to take the bait he carried on as he had in Jackson county

143
00:08:39.490 --> 00:08:43.760
diligently and with great personal integrity had this Pendagost connection,

144
00:08:43.940 --> 00:08:45.000
not been widely known.

145
00:08:45.030 --> 00:08:49.560
It's unlikely that anyone on Capitol hill would've ever linked the two this soon

146
00:08:49.561 --> 00:08:54.560
turned out to be extremely fortunate in 1939 justice Truman's first term

147
00:08:54.561 --> 00:08:58.320
was ending. The federal government came rolling into Kansas city.

148
00:08:58.660 --> 00:09:03.000
Tom Pendagost was arrested and jailed and his political machine was destroyed.

149
00:09:03.400 --> 00:09:06.800
This left Truman in a precarious position. It only won his Senate seat.

150
00:09:06.801 --> 00:09:07.880
Thanks to Pendagost.

151
00:09:07.880 --> 00:09:12.120
Did he have the political skills to win a second term by himself? Well,

152
00:09:12.300 --> 00:09:14.440
as it turns out, he nearly didn't in the,

153
00:09:14.570 --> 00:09:17.670
the bruising 1940 primary Truman squeaked,

154
00:09:17.671 --> 00:09:21.510
the democratic nomination for his seat by a mere 8,000 votes.

155
00:09:21.740 --> 00:09:23.950
This meant relying heavily on urban areas,

156
00:09:23.951 --> 00:09:28.310
including urban areas with large African American populations from 1940 on

157
00:09:28.490 --> 00:09:31.910
Truman would have a lasting reputation as a big city. Liberal,

158
00:09:32.200 --> 00:09:35.380
still Truman was returned to Washington and this on him.

159
00:09:35.440 --> 00:09:38.420
He was determined to make his mark Truman's.

160
00:09:38.421 --> 00:09:43.220
First term had been marked by muted support of whatever was popular in Missouri,

161
00:09:43.290 --> 00:09:46.980
like FD R's new deal or Bill's backing American isolationism.

162
00:09:47.160 --> 00:09:51.620
His second term though saw Truman suddenly become a vocal champion of re

163
00:09:52.100 --> 00:09:52.370
retirement.

164
00:09:52.370 --> 00:09:56.130
It's like Truman knew America was already destined to enter the war Europe and

165
00:09:56.470 --> 00:09:59.850
he was going to use it to his advantage in March,

166
00:09:59.850 --> 00:10:03.410
1941 treatment approached Franklin Roosevelt's just then embarking on his

167
00:10:03.411 --> 00:10:04.090
record.

168
00:10:04.090 --> 00:10:07.570
Breaking third term treatment told the presidents that he was worried about the

169
00:10:07.690 --> 00:10:11.410
military wasting money and recommended setting up a panel to investigate

170
00:10:11.450 --> 00:10:14.610
spending FDR basically shrugged and said, sure,

171
00:10:14.830 --> 00:10:19.560
why not that in auspicious start was how the Truman committee was born running

172
00:10:19.561 --> 00:10:21.560
from 1941 to 1944.

173
00:10:21.580 --> 00:10:26.000
The Truman committee became famous across America like a superhero accountant

174
00:10:26.200 --> 00:10:29.080
whose superpower is being really, really good at accounting,

175
00:10:29.340 --> 00:10:34.000
Truman combed through every expense, noting every penny over three years,

176
00:10:34.060 --> 00:10:36.240
he saved the government billions of dollars.

177
00:10:36.580 --> 00:10:40.430
This Anthony not so subtle side effect of separating him from his pentagons

178
00:10:40.790 --> 00:10:41.060
past.

179
00:10:41.060 --> 00:10:45.550
Once the us entered the war in 1941 Truman's pen bushing came to be seen as

180
00:10:45.560 --> 00:10:50.190
patriotism ensuring money that would've been wasted went towards fighting

181
00:10:50.490 --> 00:10:54.030
Hitler. The, a arts was that Truman reached 1944,

182
00:10:54.090 --> 00:10:56.270
no longer known as the Senator from Pendagost,

183
00:10:56.470 --> 00:10:58.820
but as a respected centrist Democrat,

184
00:10:59.050 --> 00:11:02.980
this was unbelievably good timing. In 1944,

185
00:11:02.981 --> 00:11:06.060
the Democrats were trying to decide their ticket for the upcoming presidential

186
00:11:06.300 --> 00:11:10.540
election while there was no doubt, FDR would be the headline act. Current VP,

187
00:11:10.620 --> 00:11:11.860
a guy called Henry A.

188
00:11:11.860 --> 00:11:14.700
Wallace was considered to left wing to be allowed to run again.

189
00:11:14.840 --> 00:11:17.500
So party bosses essentially went to FBI and said, look,

190
00:11:17.820 --> 00:11:21.770
we're gonna replace Wallace deal with it. Do which we'd love to imagine.

191
00:11:22.070 --> 00:11:25.370
FDR would say something like, sure, whatever. Get out of my office.

192
00:11:25.850 --> 00:11:30.850
I have a war to win in that moment. The fate of these two men were sealed.

193
00:11:30.900 --> 00:11:35.530
Henry Wallace was destined to be pushed out of the corridors of power and

194
00:11:36.130 --> 00:11:40.920
Truman. Well, Truman was suddenly destined to become presidents.

195
00:11:41.500 --> 00:11:43.680
Now you might not be running for office,

196
00:11:44.060 --> 00:11:48.320
but if you were you'd need a website and R recommends building that website with

197
00:11:48.321 --> 00:11:52.080
Squarespace, how's that for a transition. So look a couple of things.

198
00:11:52.130 --> 00:11:56.720
Maybe you've got an idea for some sort of business knocking around in your head.

199
00:11:56.721 --> 00:11:59.200
Well, the only way to figure out if that business,

200
00:11:59.260 --> 00:12:03.760
if that idea is something you should pursue is getting it out there to the

201
00:12:03.761 --> 00:12:06.040
world. And this can be daunting because you know,

202
00:12:06.110 --> 00:12:08.840
it's kind of scary to go and pursue new things, but well,

203
00:12:08.980 --> 00:12:12.440
not knowing how to set up a website, shouldn't be an excuse. I,

204
00:12:12.530 --> 00:12:15.510
and there are no excuses available with Squarespace.

205
00:12:15.511 --> 00:12:18.750
Squarespace allows you to create a powerful website, whatever you're up to.

206
00:12:18.751 --> 00:12:20.950
You wanna sell something online? Yes.

207
00:12:21.260 --> 00:12:25.070
It's easy to set up a store with Squarespace or you wanna do a podcast. Well,

208
00:12:25.420 --> 00:12:28.350
yeah, support it as well. What about a YouTube channel? Well,

209
00:12:28.351 --> 00:12:30.430
obviously you wanna have the YouTube channel on YouTube,

210
00:12:30.810 --> 00:12:32.910
but you need a website to compliment that look nice,

211
00:12:33.020 --> 00:12:34.220
some professional and all that.

212
00:12:34.400 --> 00:12:38.340
It starts on square space with a beautiful template that you can customize until

213
00:12:38.341 --> 00:12:43.340
your heart's content or start from scratch or move over from an existing

214
00:12:43.341 --> 00:12:45.660
domain. Then you just go through this customization.

215
00:12:45.780 --> 00:12:48.380
Processs it's all super easy. And once you've done that,

216
00:12:48.381 --> 00:12:51.940
your website's up and running. There's nothing afterwards. There's no patches.

217
00:12:52.130 --> 00:12:55.090
There's no tech nonsense you have to deal with is all very easy.

218
00:12:55.230 --> 00:12:58.370
And Squarespace also handles all the websitey stuff like I say, podcasts,

219
00:12:58.371 --> 00:13:00.610
but they also do mailing list, social integrations,

220
00:13:00.990 --> 00:13:04.850
all of that websitey stuff that sounds confusing is just made easy with

221
00:13:04.851 --> 00:13:08.890
Squarespace. It's also 24 7 customer support in case you get confused,

222
00:13:09.190 --> 00:13:12.730
but you probably won't so head to squarespace.com for a free trial.

223
00:13:12.731 --> 00:13:13.850
And when you're ready to launch, go

224
00:13:17.160 --> 00:13:20.560
to.com/biographics and you'll save 10% of your first purchase of a website or a

225
00:13:20.561 --> 00:13:22.680
domain. And let's get back to it.

226
00:13:28.940 --> 00:13:33.880
The 1944 democratic convention was unconventional to say the least as

227
00:13:34.080 --> 00:13:36.470
party bosses descended on Chicago, Henry A.

228
00:13:36.470 --> 00:13:41.270
Wallace got wind of his replacements and he began kicking up a huge stink

229
00:13:41.410 --> 00:13:42.430
Truman. On the other hand,

230
00:13:42.790 --> 00:13:47.110
discovered that he was in the running to BEP and did everything in his power to

231
00:13:47.111 --> 00:13:47.944
wiggle out of it.

232
00:13:48.130 --> 00:13:52.270
But there was nothing he could do to stop his staff from rising at the

233
00:13:52.271 --> 00:13:55.700
convention. The anti Wallace faction was strong enough to bring the peed down,

234
00:13:55.800 --> 00:13:58.420
but it was too weak to get their own one elected.

235
00:13:58.680 --> 00:14:02.180
So everyone settled on Truman as the compromised candidate. And finally,

236
00:14:02.350 --> 00:14:06.700
after two bruising days, the man from Missouri wound up on the ticket.

237
00:14:06.910 --> 00:14:11.660
Absolutely no one was happy with this Truman didn't want to be V FDR

238
00:14:11.661 --> 00:14:12.780
didn't want him to be deep.

239
00:14:12.920 --> 00:14:17.770
And everyone at the convention had somebody that they would rather see as

240
00:14:17.870 --> 00:14:19.930
the vape yet. It didn't matter. Come November.

241
00:14:20.150 --> 00:14:24.330
FD R's wartime record saw him a handsy beat Republican candidate, Thomas Dewey,

242
00:14:24.630 --> 00:14:27.410
and suddenly Truman was the vice president.

243
00:14:27.830 --> 00:14:31.890
It was a role that he would hold for barely 80 days. On the afternoon of April,

244
00:14:31.891 --> 00:14:36.010
the 12th, 1945, Harry Truman was summoned the white house. It,

245
00:14:36.240 --> 00:14:39.000
it was a curious order to receive in his entire time.

246
00:14:39.240 --> 00:14:43.960
As VP Truman had barely seen FDR barely been let in on plans for his fourth

247
00:14:43.961 --> 00:14:47.840
term, as Truman arrived at the white house, Alan Roosevelt came out to meet him.

248
00:14:48.090 --> 00:14:48.900
Harry.

249
00:14:48.900 --> 00:14:53.640
She said the president is dead Truman later said he felt as if the moon,

250
00:14:54.060 --> 00:14:56.960
the stars and all the planets had fallen on me.

251
00:14:57.100 --> 00:14:59.560
He collapsed into a big leather chair in the cabinet room,

252
00:14:59.561 --> 00:15:02.960
waiting for the chief justice to come and swear in his presidents.

253
00:15:03.180 --> 00:15:04.640
As others arrived at the white house,

254
00:15:04.740 --> 00:15:08.000
the enormity of it all sank in America was at war.

255
00:15:08.520 --> 00:15:09.840
Although that war was in its end game,

256
00:15:09.841 --> 00:15:14.470
the political giant who guided the nation through its darkest hours was gone

257
00:15:14.770 --> 00:15:17.630
in his place was a small town man who wore it,

258
00:15:17.631 --> 00:15:22.150
not for a quirk of fate would right now be managing a men's clothing store

259
00:15:22.490 --> 00:15:23.323
in Missouri.

260
00:15:23.490 --> 00:15:27.110
One cabinet member later recorded looking at Truman and thinking he looks like

261
00:15:27.111 --> 00:15:28.430
such a little man.

262
00:15:28.730 --> 00:15:32.460
He didn't mean in literal terms at the press conference announcing Truman's

263
00:15:32.461 --> 00:15:34.820
Ascension to the presidency. People were shocked.

264
00:15:35.040 --> 00:15:38.700
One BBC journalist later recorded reporters saying, my God,

265
00:15:39.010 --> 00:15:40.300
what have we been landed with?

266
00:15:40.840 --> 00:15:44.220
You could tell Truman was thinking along similar lines that day,

267
00:15:44.310 --> 00:15:48.620
April the 12th Truman became the 33rd president of the United States almost

268
00:15:48.621 --> 00:15:49.360
immediately.

269
00:15:49.360 --> 00:15:53.210
He was thrown in at the deep end Truman's first months in office were the kind

270
00:15:53.211 --> 00:15:57.370
prospective presidents of nightmares about barely had his first press conference

271
00:15:57.371 --> 00:15:57.930
ended.

272
00:15:57.930 --> 00:16:01.210
Then he was having to sign off on arrangements for the first ever UN meeting in

273
00:16:01.211 --> 00:16:03.650
San Francisco. Only weeks after that,

274
00:16:03.651 --> 00:16:06.810
he was desperately helping to arrange Germanys unconditional surrender.

275
00:16:07.190 --> 00:16:11.770
It was a whirlwind of work overseeing the ends of a war that had raged on for

276
00:16:12.500 --> 00:16:16.320
it was also about to get so much harder. Although Germany is surrender,

277
00:16:16.520 --> 00:16:19.480
it ended the war in Europe. The war in the Pacific was still raging.

278
00:16:19.700 --> 00:16:22.880
It wouldn't be long before the new president was called upon to make the most

279
00:16:22.881 --> 00:16:26.520
controversial decision any president will ever make

280
00:16:33.010 --> 00:16:35.510
For as long as people talk about Harry Truman,

281
00:16:35.620 --> 00:16:39.390
they'll talk about his decision to drop two atomic bombs on Japan.

282
00:16:39.610 --> 00:16:40.510
Was it a war crime?

283
00:16:40.810 --> 00:16:45.750
Was it an atrocity or was it a proportionate response to a racist militaristic

284
00:16:45.751 --> 00:16:49.110
nation that was refusing to surrender? Whichever side you are wrong?

285
00:16:49.210 --> 00:16:53.700
The basic facts are there faced with estimates of up to far life hundred

286
00:16:54.100 --> 00:16:55.780
thousand dead in an invasion of Japan,

287
00:16:56.540 --> 00:16:59.180
Truman authorized nuclear strikes on August the sixth,

288
00:16:59.320 --> 00:17:03.460
the little boy bomb dropped on Hiroshima ending 80,000 lives.

289
00:17:03.680 --> 00:17:07.980
The next day Truman went on TV and declared that if the Japanese do not now

290
00:17:08.040 --> 00:17:12.900
accept our terms of surrender, they may expect a reign of ruin from the air.

291
00:17:13.160 --> 00:17:17.530
The line of which has never been seen on this earth. Two days later,

292
00:17:17.630 --> 00:17:22.610
the Fatman bomb landed on Nagasaki killing 40,000 on August the 15th,

293
00:17:22.930 --> 00:17:27.170
1945. Ember Hirohito announced Japan's surrender. World war II was over,

294
00:17:27.670 --> 00:17:31.210
but while one war was winding down, another was lumbering interview.

295
00:17:31.470 --> 00:17:35.080
The following spring, 1946 Truman joined Britain's wartime leader,

296
00:17:35.081 --> 00:17:37.920
Winston Churchill on stage in Missouri there,

297
00:17:37.921 --> 00:17:41.320
the former prime minister gave a speech in which he warned of an iron curtain

298
00:17:41.410 --> 00:17:44.280
descending across the continent of Europe today.

299
00:17:44.281 --> 00:17:48.000
The iron curtain speech is seen as the opening salvo in the cold war.

300
00:17:48.260 --> 00:17:51.480
Not only did it galvanize Western opinion to the USSR,

301
00:17:51.540 --> 00:17:55.760
it also pushed Truman to make his own major speech on March the 12th,

302
00:17:56.040 --> 00:17:58.720
1947, Truman stood before Congress and declared.

303
00:17:59.120 --> 00:18:02.960
I believe that it must be the policy of the United States to support free

304
00:18:02.961 --> 00:18:07.960
people's who are resisting attempted subjugation by armed minorities or

305
00:18:07.961 --> 00:18:09.150
by outside eye pressures.

306
00:18:09.430 --> 00:18:13.750
I believe that we must assist free peoples to work out their own destinies

307
00:18:14.250 --> 00:18:17.870
in their own way. It was the beginning of the Truman doctrine,

308
00:18:17.890 --> 00:18:21.430
the American policy of containing Soviet expansion.

309
00:18:21.690 --> 00:18:25.190
And it would set the tone for the entire 20th century.

310
00:18:25.530 --> 00:18:29.860
One positive side effect came just a year later. Secretary of stage George C.

311
00:18:29.860 --> 00:18:34.020
Marshall proposed a plan to rescue Europe's shattered economies and Truman

312
00:18:34.060 --> 00:18:37.860
embraced it as a way to stop the communist advance from spreading Westwood

313
00:18:37.920 --> 00:18:40.420
signed into law on April the third, 1948,

314
00:18:40.421 --> 00:18:43.180
the Marshall plan would totally rebuild Europe,

315
00:18:43.400 --> 00:18:47.740
but the Soviets were all to aware of its secondary anti communist aim,

316
00:18:48.240 --> 00:18:52.730
and they weren't going to leave such a provocation unanswered on June the 24th,

317
00:18:53.050 --> 00:18:57.890
1948. The USSR suddenly blocked all roads and rail lines into west Berlin.

318
00:18:58.230 --> 00:19:02.930
At the time some 2 million people lived there in Irelands of allied Ruit and

319
00:19:02.931 --> 00:19:05.570
ocean of Soviet administration in Washington.

320
00:19:05.750 --> 00:19:09.970
The Hawks in Truman's cabinet urge the president to declare war to take the for,

321
00:19:10.440 --> 00:19:11.220
to the Soviets.

322
00:19:11.220 --> 00:19:15.800
But for someone who would garner a reputation as a warmonger Treeman was

323
00:19:15.890 --> 00:19:17.120
remarkably restrained.

324
00:19:17.260 --> 00:19:21.120
He ordered supplies to be flown into west Berlin for as long as the blockade

325
00:19:21.121 --> 00:19:23.160
remains known as the Berlin airlift,

326
00:19:23.161 --> 00:19:26.400
the operation would become one of the biggest logistical feats of the 20th

327
00:19:26.401 --> 00:19:27.800
century at its height.

328
00:19:28.060 --> 00:19:31.950
One plane was landing in or taking off from spur in every 30 seconds,

329
00:19:32.110 --> 00:19:34.590
bringing clothing, food, water, medicine,

330
00:19:34.730 --> 00:19:37.230
and basic supplies for an entire city.

331
00:19:37.370 --> 00:19:41.830
It was a grand's achievement all the more so for not spiraling into world war

332
00:19:42.190 --> 00:19:45.950
three. By the time the Soviets lifted the blockade in the spring of 1949,

333
00:19:45.951 --> 00:19:48.550
there was no longer any doubting what was happening.

334
00:19:48.770 --> 00:19:53.620
Any lingering hopes of reproachment with the communists was over the cold

335
00:19:53.800 --> 00:19:55.180
war was officially on

336
00:20:01.600 --> 00:20:02.940
By rights treatment should have ended.

337
00:20:03.120 --> 00:20:07.100
His first term riding high had overseen the end of world war II helped rebuild

338
00:20:07.101 --> 00:20:09.020
Europe overcome the Berlin blockade,

339
00:20:09.280 --> 00:20:13.530
issued an executive order desegregating in the military and made the us the

340
00:20:13.531 --> 00:20:15.730
first nation on earth to recognize Israel.

341
00:20:16.030 --> 00:20:19.250
But rather than a winner Truman marched towards his first election,

342
00:20:19.810 --> 00:20:22.850
a badly damaged loser in 1946,

343
00:20:22.851 --> 00:20:27.250
the midterms had resulted in a Republican wave sweeping Congress as the 1948

344
00:20:27.410 --> 00:20:27.891
election approach.

345
00:20:27.891 --> 00:20:31.930
The Democrats liberal winged jump ship to campaign for Henry A.

346
00:20:31.930 --> 00:20:36.440
Wall progressive party upstairs the party big wigs had begged DWI di Eisenhower

347
00:20:36.441 --> 00:20:38.960
to replace treatment as the democratic candidate. Finally,

348
00:20:39.100 --> 00:20:43.240
the Southern Democrats also abandons the party to vote for STR Thurman's Dixie

349
00:20:43.350 --> 00:20:45.040
KRAS as an November, 1948,

350
00:20:45.240 --> 00:20:49.400
approached a victory for Republican Thomas Dewey seemed certain nevermind that

351
00:20:49.460 --> 00:20:53.240
Truman spent the fall doggedly riding trains from town to town across the

352
00:20:53.241 --> 00:20:53.441
nation,

353
00:20:53.441 --> 00:20:58.160
making fiery speeches to crying the do nothing good for nothing Republican

354
00:20:58.640 --> 00:21:02.520
Congress nevermind the vast crowds that turned up to Truman's whistle.

355
00:21:02.880 --> 00:21:06.240
Stop tours. Chaning give them hell Harry. None of it mattered.

356
00:21:06.640 --> 00:21:09.270
Polls all said that Truman was toast.

357
00:21:09.530 --> 00:21:11.790
As the Chicago Tribune prepared its presses.

358
00:21:11.791 --> 00:21:16.590
The editors were so sure of a Dewey landslide that they printed the front pages,

359
00:21:16.591 --> 00:21:18.790
reading Dewey, defeats Truman.

360
00:21:18.970 --> 00:21:23.230
We can only hope that there was plenty of humble pie to go around that news

361
00:21:23.470 --> 00:21:26.670
stream. On November 3rd, 1948, America woke to the news.

362
00:21:27.070 --> 00:21:29.820
Harry Truman had won a second term.

363
00:21:30.160 --> 00:21:34.100
Not only that he trounced Dewey, the Dixiecrats had collapsed.

364
00:21:34.101 --> 00:21:38.500
The progressive party was nowhere to be seen when Truman picked up a copy of the

365
00:21:38.501 --> 00:21:41.980
Chicago Tribune and waved at reporters of vast grin on his face.

366
00:21:42.740 --> 00:21:46.780
An iconic moments in politics was made come January Truman returned to the white

367
00:21:46.781 --> 00:21:50.410
house. Following first televised inauguration in history immediately,

368
00:21:50.411 --> 00:21:55.090
he got to work transforming the country, or rather he tried to get to work.

369
00:21:55.400 --> 00:21:59.610
Despite pulling off the political upset of the century treatment found his hands

370
00:21:59.680 --> 00:22:03.570
tied in his second term by a democratic Congress that hated his guts.

371
00:22:03.720 --> 00:22:05.970
When he tried to pass his fair deal legislation,

372
00:22:05.971 --> 00:22:07.810
which would've brought in swaths of new.

373
00:22:07.970 --> 00:22:10.000
So programs benefiting African Americans.

374
00:22:10.500 --> 00:22:14.160
It got so watered down that there was almost nothing left,

375
00:22:14.460 --> 00:22:18.720
but Truman's second term was never faded to be remembered for its domestic

376
00:22:18.780 --> 00:22:19.470
agenda.

377
00:22:19.470 --> 00:22:24.040
Instead it would be events on a peninsula 11,000 kilometers away that decided

378
00:22:24.140 --> 00:22:27.160
how history saw Harry Truman on June the 25th,

379
00:22:27.440 --> 00:22:32.150
1950 north Korean troops poured over the 38th parallel invading South Korea.

380
00:22:32.410 --> 00:22:34.230
It was the beginning of the Korean war,

381
00:22:34.350 --> 00:22:38.470
a war that would kill millions and leave scars that remain to this day.

382
00:22:38.730 --> 00:22:42.230
It would also be the war that ended Harry Truman's career.

383
00:22:48.870 --> 00:22:52.740
Few wars have ever been as costly and as pointless as Korea world war,

384
00:22:52.820 --> 00:22:55.900
I may have been a freak accidents that blew up in everyone's faces,

385
00:22:55.920 --> 00:22:59.820
but at least it had an outcome. The collapse of the old European order,

386
00:23:00.380 --> 00:23:01.101
Korea by contrast,

387
00:23:01.101 --> 00:23:05.380
started with a communist backed state and an American backed state facing each

388
00:23:05.381 --> 00:23:07.100
other across the 38th parallel.

389
00:23:07.640 --> 00:23:12.490
And it ended with a communist act state and an American back state facing

390
00:23:12.491 --> 00:23:14.570
each other across the 38th parallel.

391
00:23:14.990 --> 00:23:19.250
The worst part was the chaos that it took to get to the stale mate. At first,

392
00:23:19.390 --> 00:23:22.810
the north overran the south leaving swaths of destruction in its wake,

393
00:23:23.040 --> 00:23:24.410
then Truman dispatched,

394
00:23:24.411 --> 00:23:28.610
general Douglas MacArthur to Korea and the us UN force chased the north back

395
00:23:28.611 --> 00:23:31.840
over the 38th parallel laid waste to their country.

396
00:23:32.140 --> 00:23:35.880
But then the Chinese got involved on North Korea side and forced the Americans

397
00:23:35.980 --> 00:23:38.800
all the way back to where that started. Cities were burned.

398
00:23:39.430 --> 00:23:42.920
Massacres were committed and towns were bombed to oblivion,

399
00:23:43.100 --> 00:23:44.320
but for Harry Truman's legacy,

400
00:23:44.750 --> 00:23:49.320
only one thing ultimately mattered the conduct of Douglas MacArthur.

401
00:23:49.760 --> 00:23:53.440
Although Truman had been the one to send MacArthur to Korea without waiting for

402
00:23:53.600 --> 00:23:57.560
congressional approval. The general soon proved himself to be a loose cannon.

403
00:23:57.820 --> 00:24:01.600
In early 1951, he started demanding that America invade China,

404
00:24:01.601 --> 00:24:04.440
which would've sparked a full war across the,

405
00:24:04.670 --> 00:24:08.390
of Pacific with world war II only just over Truman refused.

406
00:24:08.460 --> 00:24:12.990
They weren't going to go down the road of endless devastation for MacArthur.

407
00:24:13.100 --> 00:24:17.910
This was a Trump decision and he said so loudly. So well,

408
00:24:18.130 --> 00:24:22.150
Truman fired his and well, that was about it. Very Truman.

409
00:24:22.260 --> 00:24:25.260
When he returns from Korea, MacArthur was greeted as a hit arrow.

410
00:24:25.680 --> 00:24:28.260
Truman by contrast saw his Paul's tank.

411
00:24:28.560 --> 00:24:33.260
His favorability ratings dropped to 22% lower than any other post world Wari

412
00:24:33.261 --> 00:24:33.781
presidents,

413
00:24:33.781 --> 00:24:38.660
even Nixon at the height of Watergate didn't fall that low faced with numbers

414
00:24:38.690 --> 00:24:42.540
like that. Truman knew that he had no choice, but to prepare for his retirement.

415
00:24:42.980 --> 00:24:47.010
Although the 22nd amendments had now been passed, the president of two tons,

416
00:24:47.490 --> 00:24:51.370
an exception had been made for Truman as the sitting presidents in another

417
00:24:51.371 --> 00:24:53.930
context, Truman might have gone for a third term.

418
00:24:54.350 --> 00:24:57.810
He might have tried to match chef ER, but with the public against him,

419
00:24:58.320 --> 00:25:02.810
what was the point? Truman bowed out of the democratic primary in March, 1952,

420
00:25:03.120 --> 00:25:06.720
that November Eisenhower led the Republicans to a land line, victory,

421
00:25:06.870 --> 00:25:10.560
even carrying some Southern states when Truman left the white house in January,

422
00:25:10.900 --> 00:25:15.560
the country was glad to see him go only that wasn't quite the end of the story.

423
00:25:15.730 --> 00:25:19.600
After his second term, Truman retreated back to independence, Missouri,

424
00:25:19.660 --> 00:25:21.520
and set about tending to his legacy.

425
00:25:22.160 --> 00:25:26.400
He'd always said it done his damnest even when he was unpopular and over time,

426
00:25:26.650 --> 00:25:30.190
people came to believe him. Maybe it was the legacy of his fair deal,

427
00:25:30.240 --> 00:25:33.710
which wounds up being enacted in another form by Lindon B Johnson,

428
00:25:34.160 --> 00:25:38.710
maybe it was the memory of the man who'd ended world war II or his undoubted

429
00:25:38.711 --> 00:25:41.950
touch with the common people or his commitment to civil rights,

430
00:25:41.980 --> 00:25:45.150
even in the face of his party's Southern wing, whatever.

431
00:25:45.151 --> 00:25:49.100
The reason Truman lived long to see his legacy rehabilitate it.

432
00:25:49.520 --> 00:25:53.180
And it was all he could have asked for on Christmas day, 1972,

433
00:25:53.350 --> 00:25:57.900
Harry Truman slipped into a coma and he died the next day at the age of 88.

434
00:25:58.230 --> 00:26:03.220
Today Truman consistently ranks as one of the best presidents in us history in

435
00:26:03.221 --> 00:26:07.260
the same league as Teddy Roosevelt or FDR for a man

436
00:26:07.640 --> 00:26:12.530
seemingly destined to small town obscurity. This is remarkable,

437
00:26:12.830 --> 00:26:15.610
not even Truman thought. He had what it took to lead a nation.

438
00:26:15.750 --> 00:26:17.770
And yet when the time came,

439
00:26:18.110 --> 00:26:21.770
he stepped up and he proved the world wrong all too often,

440
00:26:21.950 --> 00:26:24.690
making videos about the lives of great people.

441
00:26:25.250 --> 00:26:26.930
It involves talking about brain boxes.

442
00:26:27.170 --> 00:26:30.680
So the privilege people with charisma spare,

443
00:26:31.020 --> 00:26:35.040
but Treeman story shows that you don't need any of that.

444
00:26:35.500 --> 00:26:40.280
You can be a 40 year old failure from nowhere and still wind

445
00:26:40.300 --> 00:26:41.440
up changing history.

446
00:26:41.910 --> 00:26:46.800
Some men may be born to greatness and some may have greatness thrust upon

447
00:26:46.801 --> 00:26:47.300
them,

448
00:26:47.300 --> 00:26:52.120
but it's arguable that none of them will ever be quite as great as Harry

449
00:26:52.260 --> 00:26:56.120
Truman the accidental president. So I really hope you found that video.
