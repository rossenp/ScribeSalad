00:00:00.150 --> 00:00:02.250
<v 0>On April the seventh, 1739,</v>

2
00:00:02.340 --> 00:00:06.330
an English criminal was executed by hanging at the gallows in York.

3
00:00:06.420 --> 00:00:08.760
His crime was stealing three horses, a manhole,

4
00:00:08.790 --> 00:00:12.930
and a gelding from a man named Thomas Creasy of Welton Yorkshire.

5
00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:15.600
The value of these horses with six pounds and 20 shillings,

6
00:00:15.840 --> 00:00:19.830
the criminal has in fact committed many other much more heinous acts,

7
00:00:19.831 --> 00:00:24.150
including highway robberies, burglaries, poachings, numerous assaults,

8
00:00:24.151 --> 00:00:25.080
and even murder it.

9
00:00:25.150 --> 00:00:29.970
Ultimately he was convicted of horse theft and perished age 33 at the end of the

10
00:00:29.971 --> 00:00:31.950
news under normal circumstances.

11
00:00:31.951 --> 00:00:34.980
That would be no reason why we would be talking about this man today,

12
00:00:34.981 --> 00:00:36.840
or even remembering his name,

13
00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:41.670
but then something strange happened almost a hundred years after his death,

14
00:00:41.880 --> 00:00:44.070
a Victorian Nola's named William Harrison,

15
00:00:44.071 --> 00:00:46.530
Ainsworth published a novel called Rockwood,

16
00:00:46.531 --> 00:00:49.650
which went on to become a big success.

17
00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:52.980
Although fictional the story took inspiration from real life events and

18
00:00:52.981 --> 00:00:57.090
characters, including a dashing adventurous and even romantic highway.

19
00:00:57.090 --> 00:01:01.020
Then by the name of Dick Tappin, he became a sensation almost overnight.

20
00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:02.670
People fell in love with Dick tap,

21
00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:06.600
and but few of them realized that they were in Emma's with this idealized

22
00:01:06.601 --> 00:01:09.420
version of him from a novel, not the real person.

23
00:01:09.660 --> 00:01:13.470
The most famous story about the highway men is the legendary 200 mile rides that

24
00:01:13.471 --> 00:01:16.050
he made from London to New York on his trusted horse,

25
00:01:16.051 --> 00:01:20.370
black bass and a single night so that he could give himself an alibi for a crime

26
00:01:20.371 --> 00:01:23.160
that he had committed in London. But you guessed at this bobble, this feat,

27
00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:28.170
if equestrianism came from the novel, not from real life, if it did happen,

28
00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:31.560
the rides may have been done by another Highwayman called John Swift,

29
00:01:31.561 --> 00:01:33.390
Nick Nevison. But for some reason,

30
00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:36.690
what do you means worth decided to credit it to Dick Turpin in Rockwood?

31
00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:39.720
Perhaps he simply liked the name more, regardless of his motivation,

32
00:01:39.721 --> 00:01:43.590
the writer transformed Dick Turpin from a common criminal destined for obscurity

33
00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:46.350
into the most notorious high women of all time.

34
00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:51.360
And today we'll be exploring his story, trying to separate fact from fiction.

35
00:01:51.800 --> 00:01:52.633
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

36
00:02:04.130 --> 00:02:06.680
<v 0>Being heavily associated with the English County of York,</v>

37
00:02:06.681 --> 00:02:11.060
Richard Dick Turpin was actually born in Essex and the village of Hempstead in a

38
00:02:11.061 --> 00:02:14.360
place called the blue bell in which still stands to this day.

39
00:02:14.630 --> 00:02:16.670
The date of his birth is a bit more uncertain,

40
00:02:16.700 --> 00:02:21.500
but historical records show that he was baptized on September the 25th, 1705.

41
00:02:21.740 --> 00:02:24.440
Unsurprisingly has only, life is one big mystery.

42
00:02:24.441 --> 00:02:25.940
We only know this at one point,

43
00:02:25.941 --> 00:02:29.540
he entered the butcher trade and became an apprentice before striking out on his

44
00:02:29.541 --> 00:02:31.160
own and possibly moving to London.

45
00:02:31.310 --> 00:02:34.490
He probably tried to operate within the boundaries of the law for a few years.

46
00:02:34.670 --> 00:02:36.200
We're not really sure how long,

47
00:02:36.350 --> 00:02:39.650
but back then being a boat show was a relatively quick way of associating with

48
00:02:39.680 --> 00:02:40.510
criminals,

49
00:02:40.510 --> 00:02:43.820
but that's because one of the most common crimes of the date was poaching.

50
00:02:43.910 --> 00:02:47.990
It was such a problem that the British parliament passed the black act of 1723,

51
00:02:48.110 --> 00:02:52.190
which was described as an act for the more effectual, punishing, wicked,

52
00:02:52.191 --> 00:02:56.990
and evil disposed persons going armed in disguise and doing injuries and

53
00:02:56.991 --> 00:03:01.120
violences do the persons and of his Majesty's subjects.

54
00:03:01.300 --> 00:03:04.690
And for the most speedy bringing the offenders to justice specifically,

55
00:03:04.691 --> 00:03:05.560
the acts was meant to sound target,

56
00:03:05.650 --> 00:03:08.890
get several groups of deer poachers who were active in the forest, snow,

57
00:03:09.460 --> 00:03:11.920
Waltham and Windsor, but it was applied of course,

58
00:03:11.921 --> 00:03:13.930
to anybody else who fit the criteria.

59
00:03:13.931 --> 00:03:18.040
And it became rather notorious and controversial, the large number of crimes,

60
00:03:18.041 --> 00:03:20.080
which were made punishable by death.

61
00:03:20.110 --> 00:03:23.710
It was called the black acts because many of the poachers in Waltham had a habit

62
00:03:23.711 --> 00:03:26.260
of blackening, their faces to disguise themselves.

63
00:03:26.440 --> 00:03:29.500
Dick Tappan probably did not have any dealings with these poachers,

64
00:03:29.501 --> 00:03:32.560
but he did associate himself with the Gregory gang,

65
00:03:32.561 --> 00:03:36.010
also called the Asics gang led by Samuel Gregory.

66
00:03:36.040 --> 00:03:40.360
They also poached among many other crimes, which meant they needed bushes,

67
00:03:40.361 --> 00:03:44.500
willing to buy their illegal mutans Turpin was their man.

68
00:03:44.560 --> 00:03:48.970
We do not know when Turpin became involved with their activities and were also

69
00:03:48.971 --> 00:03:52.450
unsure of when he decided to delete the butcher trade behinds and join up with

70
00:03:52.451 --> 00:03:56.560
the gang full time. It was most likely sometime during the early 1730s,

71
00:03:56.590 --> 00:04:00.070
because there is a mention of the group tapping included in an issue of the

72
00:04:00.071 --> 00:04:04.420
London Gazette from February, 1734, offering a 50 pound reward for that capture.

73
00:04:04.540 --> 00:04:05.680
As by that point,

74
00:04:05.710 --> 00:04:08.620
they will already want it for robberies committed in the counties of Essex,

75
00:04:08.650 --> 00:04:10.210
Middlesex, Kenton, sorry.

76
00:04:10.270 --> 00:04:12.880
The leader Samuel Gregory was described as about five feet,

77
00:04:12.881 --> 00:04:15.760
seven inches high as a scar about an inch and a half long.

78
00:04:15.761 --> 00:04:17.860
And his right cheek is fresh colored,

79
00:04:18.100 --> 00:04:22.960
whereas a Brown wig and is about 23 years old is a Smith or a Feria by trade

80
00:04:23.170 --> 00:04:26.980
to other members of the gang named in the article have that Hanes and Thomas

81
00:04:26.981 --> 00:04:27.281
route.

82
00:04:27.281 --> 00:04:31.360
And finally Dick Tappan was described as a butcher by trade it's all fresh

83
00:04:31.361 --> 00:04:35.620
colored man, very much marks with the small talks, about 26 years of age,

84
00:04:35.770 --> 00:04:38.950
about five feet, nine inches high lived some time ago at wise,

85
00:04:38.951 --> 00:04:42.760
chapel and S did latently lodged somewhere about Milbank Westman stuff.

86
00:04:42.790 --> 00:04:45.610
Whereas a blue gray coat and a light natural wig.

87
00:04:51.510 --> 00:04:52.343
<v 2>[Inaudible].</v>

88
00:04:52.500 --> 00:04:55.860
<v 0>To popular belief. The real Dick Tappan was not a lovable Rogan's.</v>

89
00:04:56.010 --> 00:04:59.640
Neither were the people that are associated with there were extremely violent

90
00:04:59.641 --> 00:05:03.840
and had no qualms about threatening beating and torturing the victims who either

91
00:05:03.841 --> 00:05:06.420
fought against them or refuse to surrender their valuables.

92
00:05:06.450 --> 00:05:09.780
By the time surfing became an official part of the Essex gang that already

93
00:05:09.781 --> 00:05:13.380
pretty much moved away from poaching completely and turned towards thievery.

94
00:05:13.440 --> 00:05:16.770
Despite his reputation as a highway man that were actually a few highway

95
00:05:16.771 --> 00:05:18.210
robberies committed at this time,

96
00:05:18.510 --> 00:05:21.840
the Essex gang preferred to target people in their own homes because it was more

97
00:05:21.841 --> 00:05:25.590
likely they would find money that they liked writing farmhouses. Most of all,

98
00:05:25.591 --> 00:05:28.890
because they were remote and quiet and the robbers could take their time to make

99
00:05:28.891 --> 00:05:30.420
sure that they go to everything of value.

100
00:05:30.450 --> 00:05:34.410
The regions surrounding Epping forest stretching between Asics and London was

101
00:05:34.530 --> 00:05:36.900
the main area of operations. During these raids,

102
00:05:36.901 --> 00:05:40.650
the gang often restrained and tortured their victims to get them to reveal where

103
00:05:40.651 --> 00:05:44.130
they had their money. One notorious case was that of Joseph Lawrence,

104
00:05:44.131 --> 00:05:48.180
a 70 year old farmer from edge web seven and other members of the gang beat up

105
00:05:48.190 --> 00:05:50.370
the old man and poured boiling water onto him.

106
00:05:50.371 --> 00:05:53.370
While Samuel Gregory raped one of the maids in another room,

107
00:05:53.430 --> 00:05:55.350
there is one surviving contemporary accounts.

108
00:05:55.380 --> 00:05:59.270
All of the gang inaction published Reed's weekly journal detailing,

109
00:05:59.300 --> 00:06:02.300
a different rate in Lawson. It said on Saturday night,

110
00:06:02.660 --> 00:06:05.960
last about seven o'clock five rogues ends at the house of widow, Shelly.

111
00:06:06.140 --> 00:06:10.250
It Lufton in Essex having pistols and threatened to murder the old lady.

112
00:06:10.251 --> 00:06:12.020
If she would not tell them where our money lay,

113
00:06:12.021 --> 00:06:14.420
which she obstinately refusing for some time,

114
00:06:14.421 --> 00:06:17.030
they threatened to lay her across the fire.

115
00:06:17.180 --> 00:06:19.910
If she did not instantly tell them which she would not do,

116
00:06:20.030 --> 00:06:23.030
but our son being in the room and threatened to be murdered, cried out,

117
00:06:23.031 --> 00:06:27.050
he would tell them if they would not measure his mother and did whereupon,

118
00:06:27.110 --> 00:06:30.680
they went upstairs and took now 100 pounds of silver tankards and other plates

119
00:06:30.830 --> 00:06:32.180
and all manner of household goods.

120
00:06:32.550 --> 00:06:35.030
Afterwards went into the cellar and drank several bottles away,

121
00:06:35.031 --> 00:06:36.590
a little wine and sprawled some meat,

122
00:06:37.100 --> 00:06:39.740
actually relics of a fearless feel while they were doing this.

123
00:06:39.860 --> 00:06:42.860
Two of their gang went to Mr. Terkel was a farmer who rents one end of the

124
00:06:42.861 --> 00:06:45.620
widow's house and robbed him of above 20 pounds.

125
00:06:45.621 --> 00:06:48.230
And then they all went off taking two of the farmers,

126
00:06:48.231 --> 00:06:49.910
horses to carry off their luggage.

127
00:06:49.911 --> 00:06:53.210
The horses were found on Sunday and the following morning and old street and

128
00:06:53.480 --> 00:06:56.390
stayed about three hours in the house. This account was from early February,

129
00:06:56.391 --> 00:06:59.600
1735. And the gang actually did not last for much longer.

130
00:06:59.601 --> 00:07:02.750
Afterwards later that same month authorities captured three members of the

131
00:07:02.751 --> 00:07:06.110
group. Although historical records disagree on the circumstances.

132
00:07:06.170 --> 00:07:09.560
What matters was that one of the criminals, a man by the name of John Wheeler,

133
00:07:09.710 --> 00:07:13.700
confessed to his deeds and informs on the rest of the Essex gang in exchange for

134
00:07:13.701 --> 00:07:15.080
his freedom. The other two men,

135
00:07:15.800 --> 00:07:18.860
John Fields and William Saunders were both found guilty on multiple accounts of

136
00:07:18.861 --> 00:07:21.890
burglary and robbery and was sentenced to death. Days later,

137
00:07:21.970 --> 00:07:24.320
the three more members of the gang were captured. Two of them,

138
00:07:25.070 --> 00:07:27.320
Joseph Rice and Humphrey Walker were also sentenced to death.

139
00:07:27.500 --> 00:07:28.880
While the third Mary Brasier,

140
00:07:29.090 --> 00:07:32.570
the only woman of the group who acted as their fence was sentenced to penal

141
00:07:32.571 --> 00:07:34.130
transportation to the colonies.

142
00:07:34.160 --> 00:07:37.310
Several other members were arrested and executed in the months that followed.

143
00:07:37.340 --> 00:07:39.170
This included the leader, Samuel Gregory,

144
00:07:39.171 --> 00:07:42.530
who was found guilty of rape among other charges and sentence death.

145
00:07:42.560 --> 00:07:46.070
The Essex gang was officially over his only two members were still alive.

146
00:07:46.190 --> 00:07:48.070
Thomas Bowden and Dick Tatton

147
00:07:55.270 --> 00:07:56.410
And ends up in stuck together.

148
00:07:56.411 --> 00:07:59.950
And they switched the modus operandi from raiding thumb houses to the crime that

149
00:07:59.951 --> 00:08:03.160
made Dick tap and famous highway rubbery. However,

150
00:08:03.161 --> 00:08:06.970
they eventually decided to disband later that same year and Bowden might've been

151
00:08:06.971 --> 00:08:11.620
apprehended soon after for counterfeiting turpines actions during the year 1736,

152
00:08:11.800 --> 00:08:15.220
a big mystery, but it seems they continued preying on travelers.

153
00:08:15.221 --> 00:08:17.830
And at one point joined forces with another highway,

154
00:08:18.040 --> 00:08:21.550
man named Tom King sometimes identified as Matthew King,

155
00:08:21.640 --> 00:08:25.240
according to one contemporary accounts written by a man named Richard Bass.

156
00:08:25.390 --> 00:08:29.200
The two highway men struck a partnership after turpine tried robbing King

157
00:08:29.380 --> 00:08:30.700
mistaking him for a gentlemen.

158
00:08:30.760 --> 00:08:34.300
This new collaboration didn't last long because in May, 1737,

159
00:08:34.301 --> 00:08:37.090
Tom King was shot and killed possibly by tarping himself.

160
00:08:37.240 --> 00:08:40.900
We say possibly because there is debate over who fired the fatal round.

161
00:08:41.110 --> 00:08:45.220
The whole reason why Richard Bayes wrote a bio on Tappan was because he was

162
00:08:45.221 --> 00:08:48.850
there for this event is part of a policy that's went out to apprehend the

163
00:08:49.540 --> 00:08:49.540
Highwayman.

164
00:08:49.540 --> 00:08:53.230
And he is the one who claims that Turpin shot his partner by mistake King

165
00:08:53.260 --> 00:08:56.700
immediately drew a pistol, which he to Mr. Bass's breasts.

166
00:08:56.730 --> 00:09:00.750
But it luckily flashed in the pan upon which King struggling to get out his

167
00:09:00.751 --> 00:09:04.050
other. It twisted rounds in his pockets and he could not tap.

168
00:09:04.200 --> 00:09:08.010
Then who was waiting not far off on horseback hearing a skirmish came up when

169
00:09:08.130 --> 00:09:10.140
King cried out, Dick shoot him,

170
00:09:10.490 --> 00:09:14.150
or we are taken by gods at which incident turban fired his pistol,

171
00:09:14.490 --> 00:09:19.320
MIS Mr. Bays and shot King in two places who cried out Dick, you have kills me,

172
00:09:19.380 --> 00:09:21.990
which tap hearing. He rode away as hard as he could.

173
00:09:22.110 --> 00:09:25.560
The reason why this account is dubious is because others have later concluded

174
00:09:25.561 --> 00:09:28.200
that Bayes had embellished his version of events.

175
00:09:28.230 --> 00:09:30.990
And so as he may have been the one who actually found the lethal shot,

176
00:09:31.080 --> 00:09:31.870
it is possible.

177
00:09:31.870 --> 00:09:35.370
He did it after King had already surrendered or when he had his back turns,

178
00:09:35.371 --> 00:09:38.790
which is why bays decided to pass the blame on to the other high women.

179
00:09:38.820 --> 00:09:42.360
While this death may or may not be attributable to Dick Turpin,

180
00:09:42.390 --> 00:09:46.950
there is no doubt that the next one was cold-blooded murder after King's demise

181
00:09:47.310 --> 00:09:50.850
turbine decided to delay Lou for a while in his old hideaway Epping forest.

182
00:09:50.970 --> 00:09:55.080
But on may the fourth, 1737, a forest keeper named Thomas Morris,

183
00:09:55.410 --> 00:09:57.930
Johns deposed him. The last I tried to apprehend the criminal old,

184
00:09:58.140 --> 00:10:01.350
but he was shot dead by Turpin. Once the murder was discovered,

185
00:10:01.351 --> 00:10:05.130
a raw proclamation was issued, which offered a ransom of 200 pounds.

186
00:10:05.280 --> 00:10:08.820
The Tibetans capture a proclamation that was included in William Ainsworth's

187
00:10:08.821 --> 00:10:10.140
introduction to Rockwood.

188
00:10:10.170 --> 00:10:13.950
And it said it's having been represented to the King that Richard Devon did on

189
00:10:13.951 --> 00:10:18.750
Wednesday. The 4th of May last barber Asley murdered Thomas Morris sevens to

190
00:10:18.751 --> 00:10:19.584
Henry Thompson.

191
00:10:19.710 --> 00:10:23.400
One of the keepers of Epping forest dins committed to other notorious felonies

192
00:10:23.520 --> 00:10:23.971
and robberies.

193
00:10:23.971 --> 00:10:27.330
Now London is majesty is pleased to promises most gracious pardons,

194
00:10:27.450 --> 00:10:31.830
if any of his accomplices and they reward of 200 pounds to any person or persons

195
00:10:31.831 --> 00:10:32.940
that shall discover him.

196
00:10:33.150 --> 00:10:37.770
So as he may be apprehended and convicted to up in was born at Baxter and Essex

197
00:10:37.800 --> 00:10:41.520
is about 30 by trade, a butcher about five feet, nine inches,

198
00:10:41.521 --> 00:10:44.670
high Brown complexion, very much boxed with smallpox.

199
00:10:44.820 --> 00:10:48.990
His cheekbones broad his face thinner towards the bottom. His bizarre, short,

200
00:10:49.140 --> 00:10:51.810
pretty uprights and broad about the shoulders.

201
00:10:51.870 --> 00:10:55.530
Also notable in the proclamation is the fact that it gives to up in his place of

202
00:10:55.531 --> 00:10:59.790
birth as faxed it instead of Hampstead like other historical records do,

203
00:10:59.791 --> 00:11:01.080
but this might have simply been a mess

204
00:11:08.030 --> 00:11:08.900
Bouncy out on him,

205
00:11:08.901 --> 00:11:11.930
dicked up and decided that it would probably be a good idea to leave Epping

206
00:11:11.931 --> 00:11:15.110
forest and go somewhere where he would be less recognizable.

207
00:11:15.111 --> 00:11:17.060
So he traveled up North to York.

208
00:11:17.150 --> 00:11:19.940
He posed as a respectable horse trader named John Palmer,

209
00:11:19.970 --> 00:11:21.920
but he did not change his ways very much.

210
00:11:21.980 --> 00:11:24.950
He have turned down the violence of his crimes for going robberies and

211
00:11:24.951 --> 00:11:27.350
burglaries in favor of horse and castle theft.

212
00:11:27.560 --> 00:11:30.920
He moved around frequently between Lincoln Cher and Yorkshire counties stealing

213
00:11:30.921 --> 00:11:34.610
from the first and then selling his ill-gotten goods in the seconds.

214
00:11:34.700 --> 00:11:38.510
The strategy worked well for over a year and might have continued to work well.

215
00:11:38.690 --> 00:11:42.470
We're not the terpenes bad temper. One day in October 17, 38,

216
00:11:42.680 --> 00:11:45.050
he shot a rooster in the street in broad daylight.

217
00:11:45.290 --> 00:11:49.670
We're not sure why maybe he was angry and wanted to take his frustrations out on

218
00:11:49.671 --> 00:11:52.970
something, or maybe he was bored and thought it would be funny either way.

219
00:11:53.060 --> 00:11:56.980
Local man named John Robinson saw him and his confronted Tappan who then

220
00:11:56.981 --> 00:12:01.060
threatened to shoot him as well. If he did not leave the rise, man, complied,

221
00:12:01.061 --> 00:12:03.250
but went and told the authorities who arrested the man.

222
00:12:03.280 --> 00:12:07.150
They knew as John Panera and sends him to the Beverly House of correction at

223
00:12:07.151 --> 00:12:10.510
this point, nobody yet knew the true identity of the person that in custody,

224
00:12:10.511 --> 00:12:12.910
but just by taking a closer look at his business,

225
00:12:12.911 --> 00:12:16.240
it became clear to authorities that John Palmer was not exactly an upstanding

226
00:12:16.241 --> 00:12:19.390
citizen. He tried to claim that he used to be a butcher in Lincolnshire,

227
00:12:19.391 --> 00:12:20.560
but fell into heavy debt.

228
00:12:20.590 --> 00:12:23.080
So he ran away in an attempt to start a new life in New York.

229
00:12:23.140 --> 00:12:26.740
This story didn't hold water though into quick chats with the authorities in the

230
00:12:26.741 --> 00:12:27.880
neighboring County revealed.

231
00:12:27.881 --> 00:12:31.630
But John Palmer was suspected of committing multiple thefts of livestock in the

232
00:12:31.631 --> 00:12:34.390
area. The case took a more serious turn at that point.

233
00:12:34.391 --> 00:12:36.490
His horse theft was a capital crime back then.

234
00:12:36.491 --> 00:12:40.270
So John Palmer was transferred to York castle to a wages trial.

235
00:12:40.360 --> 00:12:43.660
It looked like dicta then would seem to be headed for the gallows regardless of

236
00:12:43.870 --> 00:12:46.420
whether or not the world was aware of his identity. However,

237
00:12:46.421 --> 00:12:50.140
the authorities did discover who John Palmer actually was and what has to be

238
00:12:50.141 --> 00:12:50.561
considered.

239
00:12:50.561 --> 00:12:54.640
One of the earliest documented cases of forensic pathology in February, 1739.

240
00:12:54.960 --> 00:12:58.480
Southerner is a letter to his brother-in-law identified in historical records is

241
00:12:59.920 --> 00:13:03.550
[inaudible] who lived back in assets and Hempstead's and had married Tevin

242
00:13:03.551 --> 00:13:06.250
system. The lesser does not survive and its contents are unknown,

243
00:13:06.251 --> 00:13:09.940
but it is likely that the highway men wanted his family to prepare some people.

244
00:13:10.090 --> 00:13:14.440
They trusted to act as a character witness for the fictional John Palmer at his

245
00:13:14.441 --> 00:13:17.200
trial. Unfortunately, if it's open, that was no Melman.

246
00:13:17.201 --> 00:13:20.320
Back then the lessons arrived to the local post office and the recipients went

247
00:13:20.470 --> 00:13:22.690
there to pick them up and set, to pay the postdoc charges.

248
00:13:22.750 --> 00:13:24.220
When retinol was informed of the latter,

249
00:13:24.230 --> 00:13:27.580
he said he didn't know who John Palmer was and he didn't correspond with anyone

250
00:13:27.581 --> 00:13:28.630
in New York. So he refused.

251
00:13:28.630 --> 00:13:30.730
<v 4>To pay the postage. Maybe this was true, or.</v>

252
00:13:30.760 --> 00:13:33.910
<v 0>Maybe he did realize that the letter was from Turpin and he simply didn't want</v>

253
00:13:33.911 --> 00:13:35.950
to get involved with his troubles either way.

254
00:13:36.410 --> 00:13:38.170
Ronald did not take charge of the letter.

255
00:13:38.230 --> 00:13:41.650
Even more unfortunate for Turpin was that another person definitely did

256
00:13:41.651 --> 00:13:45.070
recognize you sent the letter. He was another local named James Smith.

257
00:13:45.071 --> 00:13:49.030
And in years past he used to teach type in at school and knew his handwriting

258
00:13:49.450 --> 00:13:52.600
Smith went to a magistrate named Thomas studying and informed him of this fact.

259
00:13:52.601 --> 00:13:56.200
Since the last time I paid the postal charges and took possession of the letter,

260
00:13:56.290 --> 00:13:57.550
reading it in its entirety,

261
00:13:57.551 --> 00:14:00.670
Smith became even more convinced that Dick Durbin was the man who wrote it.

262
00:14:00.700 --> 00:14:01.533
And he was then asked,

263
00:14:01.890 --> 00:14:04.570
traveled to your castle to make a positive idea of the Highwayman.

264
00:14:04.630 --> 00:14:07.090
He did that since he testified on February the 23rd,

265
00:14:07.091 --> 00:14:11.950
1739 in front of yoga authorities that the man showed to him as John Palmer was

266
00:14:11.951 --> 00:14:14.680
in fact, Richard Turpin and no other person.

267
00:14:14.770 --> 00:14:17.110
This revelation changed the complexity of the trial.

268
00:14:17.111 --> 00:14:20.950
And there were sometimes arguments in the County over whether Turpin should be

269
00:14:20.951 --> 00:14:23.290
tried in Yorkshire or London. In the end,

270
00:14:23.291 --> 00:14:26.830
this case was heard of the Yorker sizes since all of his crimes carried the

271
00:14:26.831 --> 00:14:31.060
death penalty anyway, but he was never charged with the murder of Thomas Morris,

272
00:14:31.061 --> 00:14:31.930
the forest keeper,

273
00:14:32.140 --> 00:14:35.290
or the numerous robberies and assaults that he had committed seven witnesses.

274
00:14:35.440 --> 00:14:37.600
What called against dicta up in the none in his favor.

275
00:14:37.720 --> 00:14:41.200
His story was that he had purchased the horses from an inky Burnett Hackinson

276
00:14:41.201 --> 00:14:44.440
gold John White ads. But since that man could not be found,

277
00:14:44.441 --> 00:14:47.770
he really didn't have any evidence to defend himself to nobody surprised the

278
00:14:47.771 --> 00:14:50.350
jury found tap in guilty without even leaving the court.

279
00:14:50.351 --> 00:14:52.340
And the sentenced him to death

280
00:14:58.630 --> 00:15:01.750
Execution was carried out about two weeks after the trial on April the seventh,

281
00:15:01.751 --> 00:15:02.680
1739,

282
00:15:02.770 --> 00:15:06.760
a local named Thomas Gill attended both the legal proceedings and the execution,

283
00:15:06.970 --> 00:15:11.200
and then published a pamphlet about what he saw so well that Tim tell us how the

284
00:15:11.201 --> 00:15:14.740
events unfolded the morning before Tappin's execution. He gave three pounds,

285
00:15:14.741 --> 00:15:17.710
10 shillings amongst five men who want to follow the court,

286
00:15:17.830 --> 00:15:21.310
his mourners with hat, bans and gloves and gave gloves and hat battens.

287
00:15:21.311 --> 00:15:22.870
Do several persons more.

288
00:15:22.960 --> 00:15:26.960
He also left a gold ring into pairs of shoes and clogs to a married woman.

289
00:15:27.070 --> 00:15:27.903
It bro,

290
00:15:28.060 --> 00:15:31.300
it was acquainted with this over here at the same time acknowledged he had a

291
00:15:31.301 --> 00:15:32.410
wife and child of his own.

292
00:15:32.470 --> 00:15:35.710
He was carried in a cost to the place of execution on Saturday,

293
00:15:35.711 --> 00:15:40.510
the 7th of April, 1739 with John Steed condemns also for horse stealing.

294
00:15:40.690 --> 00:15:44.470
He behaved himself with amazing assurance and bowed to the spectators.

295
00:15:44.470 --> 00:15:47.920
As he passed. It was a remarkable that as he mounted the ladder,

296
00:15:47.921 --> 00:15:51.850
his right leg trembles on which he stamped it down with an air and with

297
00:15:51.851 --> 00:15:54.130
undaunted courage looked round about him.

298
00:15:54.131 --> 00:15:56.710
And after speaking now half an hour to at the top,

299
00:15:57.010 --> 00:16:00.730
someone threw himself off the ladder and expired in about five minutes to bins.

300
00:16:00.731 --> 00:16:04.990
Body was left to swing for half the day before being cut down and capture to

301
00:16:04.991 --> 00:16:06.820
local Tavern in salt. The following morning,

302
00:16:06.821 --> 00:16:10.210
when it was given a church burial afterwards, he experienced a brief revival.

303
00:16:10.390 --> 00:16:13.150
As his remains were immediately targeted by body snatches.

304
00:16:13.151 --> 00:16:17.080
The so-called resurrection men who dug up fresh corpses and sold them to medical

305
00:16:17.081 --> 00:16:20.740
schools for anatomy studies. But again, we'll let kill tell the story.

306
00:16:20.890 --> 00:16:24.520
The grave was dug very deep and the persons whom he appointed his mourners as

307
00:16:24.670 --> 00:16:28.420
above mentioned, took all possible care to secure the body, not withstanding,

308
00:16:28.421 --> 00:16:30.430
which on Tuesday morning, about three o'clock.

309
00:16:30.430 --> 00:16:34.600
Some persons were discovered to be moving off the body, which they had taken up.

310
00:16:34.601 --> 00:16:37.990
And the malt having got sent where it was carried due and suspecting.

311
00:16:37.991 --> 00:16:39.400
It was to be an atomized,

312
00:16:39.550 --> 00:16:43.540
went to a garden in which it was deposited and brought away the body through the

313
00:16:43.541 --> 00:16:47.500
streets of the city and the sort of Trump almost naked being only laid on a

314
00:16:47.501 --> 00:16:47.921
board,

315
00:16:47.921 --> 00:16:51.910
covered with some straw and carried on Forman's shoulders and buried it in the

316
00:16:51.911 --> 00:16:54.940
same grave. Having first filled the coffin with stacked lime.

317
00:16:55.030 --> 00:16:56.900
Now that was the ends of ticks up in the man,

318
00:16:57.170 --> 00:16:59.830
but only the beginning of Dick tap and the legends.

319
00:16:59.860 --> 00:17:02.740
Thanks to people like Thomas Gill, Richard bays, and most of all,

320
00:17:02.741 --> 00:17:05.350
William Ainsworth, his feats, both real and imagined.

321
00:17:05.380 --> 00:17:07.840
We'd get told and retold in pamphlets, books,

322
00:17:07.870 --> 00:17:12.850
penny dreadfuls plays and even movies helping Dick Turpin secure his position as

323
00:17:12.851 --> 00:17:16.510
the King of the highway men. So I really hope you found that video. Interesting.
