00:00:00.060 --> 00:00:03.240
<v 0>There's a famous saying that women have to do twice as much work as men to</v>

2
00:00:03.241 --> 00:00:05.460
receive half of the credit. That's likely,

3
00:00:05.490 --> 00:00:08.610
never been true that in the life of Maria Teresa,

4
00:00:08.640 --> 00:00:12.660
the eldest daughter of Holy Roman emperor, Charles, the sixth, Maria Teresa,

5
00:00:12.690 --> 00:00:17.520
was born at a time when the idea of a woman running Austria was as absurd

6
00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:19.710
as giving the poor, the votes.

7
00:00:19.860 --> 00:00:23.220
When she took over from her father aged just 23,

8
00:00:23.310 --> 00:00:25.740
she was immediately forced to fight for her empire.

9
00:00:25.860 --> 00:00:30.420
His very survival as Europe's Kings sought to tear her inheritance away from her

10
00:00:30.450 --> 00:00:34.440
yet fight Maria Theresa did not only that she won.

11
00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:36.060
When the dust finally settled,

12
00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:40.920
it was on a strengthened Austria that would soon transform the entire continent

13
00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:42.930
over the next three decades of her rule.

14
00:00:43.080 --> 00:00:46.350
Maria Theresa enacted reforms that changed the world,

15
00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:51.180
fought off attacks from powerful enemies and gave birth to a litany of

16
00:00:51.181 --> 00:00:54.690
famous children, including Marianne's. When ads through cunning,

17
00:00:54.691 --> 00:00:59.100
tactical marriages and sheer obstinate obstinacy she forced a once hostile

18
00:00:59.101 --> 00:01:00.990
Europe to bend to our will. Today.

19
00:01:00.991 --> 00:01:04.530
We're investigating the story of one of Europe's most influential.

20
00:01:17.660 --> 00:01:21.140
She was born in Vienna on may the 13th, 1770 units,

21
00:01:21.141 --> 00:01:25.880
likely Maria Teresa sets a world record in disappointing our parents.

22
00:01:25.940 --> 00:01:30.830
That was because she was born a she at a time when Austria desperately needed

23
00:01:31.070 --> 00:01:34.460
a Royal baby boy, Maria Theresa, his father was Charles the sixth,

24
00:01:34.760 --> 00:01:38.270
Holy Roman emperor, and a member of the powerful Hapsburg dynasty.

25
00:01:38.360 --> 00:01:39.111
Unfortunately,

26
00:01:39.111 --> 00:01:43.730
the Habsburgs golden rule was that only males could inherit their crown lands,

27
00:01:43.970 --> 00:01:48.200
swath of territory, including modern Austria, Hungary, and the Czech Republic.

28
00:01:48.230 --> 00:01:52.430
Plus trunks of everything from modern day Romania to Croatia to Belgium.

29
00:01:52.550 --> 00:01:57.320
This was fine when emperors were syring baby boys and had a plethora of brothers

30
00:01:57.321 --> 00:01:59.930
waiting in the wings. But Charles had neither,

31
00:02:00.020 --> 00:02:03.770
as far as the continent was concerned, unless Charles had a son,

32
00:02:03.860 --> 00:02:07.400
the house of Habsburg would soon go extinct along with him.

33
00:02:07.550 --> 00:02:10.880
But Charles thought he had found a new pole in 17, 13,

34
00:02:10.881 --> 00:02:14.540
five years before Maria Theresa failed to be born with a Y chromosome.

35
00:02:14.810 --> 00:02:18.290
The emperor issued something known as the pragmatic sanction,

36
00:02:18.350 --> 00:02:21.140
essentially a piece of legislation that said, you know what?

37
00:02:21.440 --> 00:02:24.560
We're cool with girls. Now, the sanction trying to put into law,

38
00:02:24.590 --> 00:02:28.580
the idea of female inheritance at first, it was purely hypothetical,

39
00:02:28.610 --> 00:02:30.470
but after Maria Therese was born,

40
00:02:30.620 --> 00:02:33.620
Charles began a PR drive to make everyone accepted.

41
00:02:33.800 --> 00:02:35.750
Since the hops Habsburg glands weren't unified.

42
00:02:36.140 --> 00:02:40.160
That means spending years traveling to various Austrian Dutchies and kingdoms

43
00:02:40.161 --> 00:02:44.030
like Bohemia and trying to convince stuffy 18th century dudes,

44
00:02:44.031 --> 00:02:48.830
that girls were more than just vectors for spreading cuties. Unfortunately,

45
00:02:48.860 --> 00:02:52.760
deep down, it seems that even Charles himself didn't believe this.

46
00:02:52.850 --> 00:02:55.610
Although the sanction mentoring might soon be Empress,

47
00:02:55.850 --> 00:03:00.280
Maria Teresa's childhood was spends learning zero necessary skills.

48
00:03:00.450 --> 00:03:01.480
But to give you just one example,

49
00:03:01.660 --> 00:03:06.160
it was customary for male as to learn the empire fiendishly complex languages

50
00:03:06.190 --> 00:03:10.510
like Hungarian and check the Maria Theresa was instead given courses in

51
00:03:10.511 --> 00:03:14.950
languages designed to make her more malleable like French, Latin,

52
00:03:15.280 --> 00:03:18.820
nor was she taught anything about diplomacy, warfare politics,

53
00:03:18.821 --> 00:03:23.110
or even the basic practicalities of running an empire.

54
00:03:23.410 --> 00:03:27.640
It's almost like Charles was just fundamentally incapable of imagining a female

55
00:03:28.030 --> 00:03:30.550
ruler, no matter what his sanction might say,

56
00:03:30.670 --> 00:03:33.640
even trying to marry his daughter off to a powerful print suit,

57
00:03:33.820 --> 00:03:36.520
at least be able to defend the Empire's integrity.

58
00:03:36.580 --> 00:03:38.590
But that plan fell by the wayside.

59
00:03:38.591 --> 00:03:42.310
When his now teenage daughter went and fell for friends,

60
00:03:42.850 --> 00:03:44.950
Stephan the air to the territory of Lorraine friend,

61
00:03:45.460 --> 00:03:47.170
Stephan was certainly important,

62
00:03:47.380 --> 00:03:51.370
but he was also way more a dreamer than he was a mighty warrior.

63
00:03:51.430 --> 00:03:52.360
Still to his credit.

64
00:03:52.361 --> 00:03:56.110
Charles allowed his daughter to marry for love rather than dynastic reasons.

65
00:03:56.111 --> 00:03:58.570
They laughably rare occurrence at the time.

66
00:03:59.050 --> 00:04:01.660
There is still that love actually survived just by your friends,

67
00:04:01.661 --> 00:04:04.720
being the sort of guy who couldn't go five minutes without removing his pants

68
00:04:04.721 --> 00:04:08.830
and making for the nearest countless Maria Teresa doted on him over the next

69
00:04:08.831 --> 00:04:13.240
decades, the union would produce 16 children, including two Hodi,

70
00:04:13.241 --> 00:04:14.980
Roman emperors and Marie Antoinette.

71
00:04:15.280 --> 00:04:18.190
Those children would be prodigious baby makers too.

72
00:04:18.280 --> 00:04:22.150
By the time she eventually died, Maria Teresa would be a grandmother,

73
00:04:22.180 --> 00:04:24.730
56 times over sadly,

74
00:04:24.760 --> 00:04:29.440
none of our first children would have that elusive Y chromosome on the 20th of

75
00:04:29.440 --> 00:04:32.830
October 17, 40 Charles, the sixth diet age, just 23,

76
00:04:32.890 --> 00:04:35.560
Maria Theresa ascended to the Austrian throne. At first,

77
00:04:35.561 --> 00:04:37.990
it looks like the pragmatic sanction had worked.

78
00:04:38.050 --> 00:04:41.590
She made her husband CCO regions and the various Dutchies and kingdoms of the

79
00:04:41.591 --> 00:04:43.390
Hamburg lands recognized hut.

80
00:04:43.450 --> 00:04:46.510
But while the sanction may have smoothed the transition internally,

81
00:04:46.511 --> 00:04:50.050
it certainly hadn't worked where the rest of Europe was concerned to the

82
00:04:50.590 --> 00:04:51.371
continents. Male rulers,

83
00:04:51.371 --> 00:04:55.330
Maria Theresa was an illegitimate Empress sitting a top,

84
00:04:55.420 --> 00:04:57.640
a whole lot of prime real estate.

85
00:04:57.760 --> 00:05:02.020
There was only one way that this could have a pan out. It was time for Europe.

86
00:05:09.090 --> 00:05:09.780
<v 2>In retrospect.</v>

87
00:05:09.780 --> 00:05:12.930
<v 0>One of the most impressive things about Charles the sixth is just how incapable</v>

88
00:05:12.931 --> 00:05:13.920
he was a planning.

89
00:05:14.160 --> 00:05:17.700
We've already seen how he didn't prepare Maria Theresa for ruling Austria,

90
00:05:17.730 --> 00:05:21.870
but he also failed to prepare Austria for Europe, ignoring his sanction.

91
00:05:21.960 --> 00:05:23.970
There was no military buildup prior to his death,

92
00:05:24.090 --> 00:05:27.390
no money or weapons set aside for defending the crown lands.

93
00:05:27.630 --> 00:05:31.170
As his daughter later commented, she became head of an Ambar with no money,

94
00:05:31.171 --> 00:05:34.410
no army, no experience and no advisers given all that.

95
00:05:34.500 --> 00:05:38.910
Perhaps the only surprising thing is that the war took two whole months to kick

96
00:05:38.911 --> 00:05:41.160
off the ball. Started rolling with the moment Maria,

97
00:05:41.610 --> 00:05:44.610
Theresa ascended to the throne. See the emperor before Charles Joseph,

98
00:05:44.611 --> 00:05:49.110
the first had likewise failed to produce any male. As when he died in 1711,

99
00:05:49.111 --> 00:05:52.500
the throne had passed to his younger brother, our friend, Charles,

100
00:05:52.530 --> 00:05:57.030
but Joseph had had daughters. Some of whom had married, powerful men. Now,

101
00:05:57.140 --> 00:05:59.630
Charles, his daughter had become ruler, those powerful men,

102
00:05:59.631 --> 00:06:02.030
but wondering why their wives, Joseph,

103
00:06:02.031 --> 00:06:05.030
the first starters didn't get to inherit Austria.

104
00:06:05.120 --> 00:06:09.470
The biggest challenges came from the electors of Saxony and Bavaria who had

105
00:06:09.471 --> 00:06:12.320
formed an Alliance with Austria's old rival France,

106
00:06:12.321 --> 00:06:14.510
and started making claims on her territory.

107
00:06:14.780 --> 00:06:18.170
But the major threats Maria Teresa's rain would come from another direction

108
00:06:18.171 --> 00:06:20.090
entirely over in Prussia. Frederick,

109
00:06:20.091 --> 00:06:23.540
the great was newly on the throne and determines to live up to his future

110
00:06:23.541 --> 00:06:25.100
nickname on December the 16th,

111
00:06:25.101 --> 00:06:30.080
1740 his army marched into the filthy rich Habsburg province of Silesian Danek

112
00:06:30.440 --> 00:06:33.860
States. It was the starting gun on the war of Austrian succession.

113
00:06:34.010 --> 00:06:38.300
It would very nearly result in the destruction of Maria Teresa's embalm the

114
00:06:38.301 --> 00:06:43.280
early days of the war with marks by Maria Theresa scrambling to even get a

115
00:06:43.281 --> 00:06:47.360
shred of legitimacy as pressure wipes, the floor with Austria's troops,

116
00:06:47.361 --> 00:06:51.950
the young women floundered for allies. Her biggest win came in June of 1741.

117
00:06:51.951 --> 00:06:54.980
When she visited the Hungarian diet, a newborn baby son,

118
00:06:55.010 --> 00:06:59.360
clutched in her arms and gave a rousing address asking for the nobleman support

119
00:06:59.630 --> 00:07:02.120
shortly after she was officially crowns queen of hungry.

120
00:07:02.330 --> 00:07:07.070
But this was just a small Island amid a sea of catastrophe that

121
00:07:07.071 --> 00:07:11.810
July Charles Albert of Bavaria invaded Bohemia and had himself crowned King in

122
00:07:11.811 --> 00:07:13.040
Prague. At the same time,

123
00:07:13.041 --> 00:07:17.210
French troops marched into Austria bringing the FYS onto Habsburg tough as their

124
00:07:17.211 --> 00:07:19.010
inheritance evaporates it before arise.

125
00:07:19.011 --> 00:07:22.070
Maria Teresa tried to hold onto the title of Holy Roman emperor.

126
00:07:22.310 --> 00:07:25.340
Although not hereditary. The title had been in our family for centuries,

127
00:07:25.660 --> 00:07:27.980
although there was no chance of a female. Holy Roman emperor,

128
00:07:28.160 --> 00:07:32.720
Maria Theresa hoped to at least convince the electors to appoint her

129
00:07:33.320 --> 00:07:33.831
husbands. Instead,

130
00:07:33.831 --> 00:07:37.630
she was forced to watching horrors Charles Albert managed to get the empire

131
00:07:38.240 --> 00:07:40.940
electors onto his side on February the 12th, 1742.

132
00:07:40.941 --> 00:07:43.340
He was crowned Holy Roman and burrow Charles the seventh,

133
00:07:43.341 --> 00:07:46.520
the first non Habsburg to hold the tire. So linen almost 300 years.

134
00:07:46.850 --> 00:07:49.790
It was a crushing peolpe lawyer for the young inexperienced Maria,

135
00:07:50.270 --> 00:07:51.200
Theresa the Europe at large,

136
00:07:51.210 --> 00:07:55.520
it looks like final proof that the game was over for this upstart female

137
00:07:55.521 --> 00:07:56.150
pretender.

138
00:07:56.150 --> 00:07:59.570
You know how they say that the night is always darkest before the Dawn,

139
00:07:59.870 --> 00:08:04.070
while the sun was about to come up on Maria Teresa's fortunes. And when it did,

140
00:08:04.130 --> 00:08:08.330
she was going to show all those over-confident men. What she was really made of

141
00:08:15.400 --> 00:08:17.440
Three's Maria Teresa one, or one's on the battlefields,

142
00:08:17.530 --> 00:08:21.670
but in the realm of diplomacy in 1741 before Charles Albert became Holy Roman

143
00:08:21.671 --> 00:08:24.880
emperor, she persuaded the British to join her side, to be fair.

144
00:08:24.940 --> 00:08:27.220
This wasn't that difficult. Even today.

145
00:08:27.221 --> 00:08:31.840
British logic operates on they're kind of the enemy of France is my friend track

146
00:08:32.020 --> 00:08:34.240
and Australia was very much Franz's enemy,

147
00:08:34.420 --> 00:08:38.800
but it was still a significant win of all the powers attacking Maria Teresa's

148
00:08:39.250 --> 00:08:43.440
EMBA fronts was the scariest with Paris suddenly tied up fighting in London.

149
00:08:43.450 --> 00:08:47.020
It gave Austria's army a chance to act in the spring of 1742.

150
00:08:47.021 --> 00:08:50.590
While Charles Albert was still sat in Frankfurt, acting all smug,

151
00:08:50.770 --> 00:08:54.190
Austria invaded and occupied his home state of Bavaria.

152
00:08:54.250 --> 00:08:58.500
Then before the Emberin you wanted hit and Maria Teresa swallowed her pride and

153
00:08:58.501 --> 00:08:59.640
did something very painful.

154
00:08:59.670 --> 00:09:03.210
She gave Frederick the great exactly what he wanted in return for giving up

155
00:09:03.211 --> 00:09:08.010
Silesian Maria Teresa ensured her other scary enemy pressure was

156
00:09:08.270 --> 00:09:09.103
awesome out of the war.

157
00:09:09.120 --> 00:09:13.830
And now left only weaklings like Bavaria to deal with by may of 1743 Austria's

158
00:09:13.831 --> 00:09:17.820
troops had retaken Bohemia leaving Charles Albert and Xcel without a kingdom

159
00:09:17.940 --> 00:09:21.360
that same month, Maria Teresa was officially crowned queen of Bohemia in Prague,

160
00:09:21.600 --> 00:09:23.220
a slightly gross experiences.

161
00:09:23.221 --> 00:09:26.190
The corpses of enemy troops were still blowing in the streets.

162
00:09:26.420 --> 00:09:28.080
Not long after the British smashed the fringe,

163
00:09:28.090 --> 00:09:31.980
the basle of dashing and not September Maria Theresa convinced salvo to join the

164
00:09:31.981 --> 00:09:35.430
war faced with mounting losses and new enemies to fight the French were all

165
00:09:35.431 --> 00:09:39.420
like, you know what? Forget this and retreated back to that borders,

166
00:09:39.450 --> 00:09:41.730
leaving poor Charles out at all isolated,

167
00:09:41.820 --> 00:09:44.190
although the war would drag on for several more years,

168
00:09:44.400 --> 00:09:47.340
it was already effectively Aviva in January, 1745,

169
00:09:47.341 --> 00:09:51.330
Charles Albert died whilst in on XL, seeing how hopeless the situation was,

170
00:09:51.331 --> 00:09:54.420
his son and success at cut a deal in return for Austria.

171
00:09:54.450 --> 00:09:58.050
Withdrawing from Bavaria had to give up all claims on the reiterates,

172
00:09:58.051 --> 00:10:01.290
his territory, that autumn, the Holy Roman Ambar elected friends,

173
00:10:01.770 --> 00:10:04.590
Stephan as its new ruler under the name Francis the first,

174
00:10:04.680 --> 00:10:06.990
although it was a husband's on the throne,

175
00:10:07.170 --> 00:10:12.060
Maria Theresa never left any doubt about who was really calling the shots as the

176
00:10:12.061 --> 00:10:15.600
war wound down. The only bum note was the permanent loss of sight,

177
00:10:15.601 --> 00:10:18.090
leisure to Frederick the great Australia game lead,

178
00:10:18.091 --> 00:10:19.380
trying to find and reclaim it.

179
00:10:19.410 --> 00:10:23.310
But given he's known as Frederick the grace and Frederick the crappy,

180
00:10:23.520 --> 00:10:25.830
you can probably guess how that wins.

181
00:10:25.890 --> 00:10:30.840
The war of Austrian succession finally ended in October of 1748 against all the

182
00:10:30.841 --> 00:10:33.750
odds Maria Theresa had done it whilst I Nisha was gone.

183
00:10:33.780 --> 00:10:35.520
The rest of the territory was intact.

184
00:10:35.640 --> 00:10:39.990
The title of Holy Roman emperor was back in our family and Europe was no longer

185
00:10:39.991 --> 00:10:41.970
in any doubt about a woman ruling Austria.

186
00:10:42.030 --> 00:10:44.310
If she'd been just a little less skilled at diplomacy,

187
00:10:44.311 --> 00:10:45.720
a little less quick on her feet,

188
00:10:45.960 --> 00:10:50.580
Maria Teresa could have watched her entire legacy vanished before arise.

189
00:10:50.670 --> 00:10:51.450
Instead,

190
00:10:51.450 --> 00:10:56.220
her EMBA would now survive in one form or another all the way into world war

191
00:10:56.221 --> 00:10:58.110
one, but Europe's young emperor.

192
00:10:58.120 --> 00:11:01.020
Wasn't mentally content with holding her territory.

193
00:11:01.110 --> 00:11:03.720
The word exposed how weak her empire really was,

194
00:11:03.900 --> 00:11:08.400
how decentralized and vulnerable. If Maria Theresa wanted her lands to survive,

195
00:11:08.580 --> 00:11:11.640
she was going to have to give them a serious overhaul this well,

196
00:11:11.820 --> 00:11:16.110
could she have known just how far reaching the impact of these reforms would be

197
00:11:22.880 --> 00:11:26.270
Contradiction of Maria Teresa's life is that her reforms will liberalize the

198
00:11:26.271 --> 00:11:31.100
whole of Europe all while she herself was a staunchly Catholic conservative on

199
00:11:31.101 --> 00:11:31.371
paper.

200
00:11:31.371 --> 00:11:35.510
Maria Theresa had no inclination towards improving our subjects lives than

201
00:11:35.690 --> 00:11:38.810
Napoleon had. So not conquering everything in sight,

202
00:11:39.020 --> 00:11:42.350
but she was a practical person. If reform would benefit our empire,

203
00:11:42.590 --> 00:11:44.120
she would pursue it regardless.

204
00:11:44.210 --> 00:11:47.330
It was this quality that would turn her into one of the greatest rulers in

205
00:11:47.331 --> 00:11:47.900
history.

206
00:11:47.900 --> 00:11:51.260
The transformation that took place some to Maria Theresa can be summed up with

207
00:11:51.261 --> 00:11:55.300
three words, centralization, professionalization, and deficiency.

208
00:11:55.480 --> 00:11:56.560
Let's talk with them in order.

209
00:11:56.620 --> 00:12:00.400
The first thing to know is that the Habsburg lands were not a unified empire.

210
00:12:00.460 --> 00:12:04.570
Each of the regions had its own feudal dot ruling at the local level.

211
00:12:04.630 --> 00:12:08.110
This means that the empire had no control over local administration,

212
00:12:08.111 --> 00:12:12.310
relying on a handful of Lords and bishops to do everything from collect taxes,

213
00:12:12.311 --> 00:12:17.260
to write laws, Maria, Teresa swept all this archaic nonsense away under her.

214
00:12:17.260 --> 00:12:18.010
Watch the empire,

215
00:12:18.010 --> 00:12:22.030
his various parts were integrated into a coherent whole new civil servants were

216
00:12:22.031 --> 00:12:23.500
trained to take over from the dots,

217
00:12:23.560 --> 00:12:27.370
the nobility and the church lost both their powers and their tax exempt status

218
00:12:27.430 --> 00:12:29.290
with this political centralization game,

219
00:12:29.291 --> 00:12:31.000
the drive to do the same for the economy.

220
00:12:31.480 --> 00:12:35.230
Internal tariffs that had existed for centuries were abolished the entire empire

221
00:12:35.500 --> 00:12:37.000
absorbed into a single market.

222
00:12:37.240 --> 00:12:40.510
The census was introduced and researchers sent to gather data on the Empire's

223
00:12:40.511 --> 00:12:43.600
lands, allowing for more rational policies to be formulated,

224
00:12:43.780 --> 00:12:47.770
to do all this census taking and administering Maria Theresa stopped her long on

225
00:12:47.771 --> 00:12:51.850
unqualified members of the nobility and started promoting the professional.

226
00:12:51.851 --> 00:12:53.470
Middle-class likewise,

227
00:12:53.471 --> 00:12:57.760
the buffoonish aristocrats in the military were ejected and actual competent

228
00:12:57.761 --> 00:12:59.830
officers were brought in for the first time.

229
00:13:00.520 --> 00:13:03.730
Australia was able to maintain a standing army trained in the latest warfare

230
00:13:03.731 --> 00:13:08.020
techniques. And just as centralization naturally led to professionalization.

231
00:13:08.200 --> 00:13:13.000
So creating this new professional class inevitably led to overhauling education.

232
00:13:13.150 --> 00:13:15.280
One of the biggest triggers came in 1749.

233
00:13:15.281 --> 00:13:17.410
When the judiciary was separated from the state,

234
00:13:17.650 --> 00:13:22.120
this created a sudden desperate need for learning judges alongside all of the

235
00:13:22.121 --> 00:13:26.230
new civil servants. So Maria Theresa threw open the doors to higher education.

236
00:13:26.500 --> 00:13:29.980
She approved there's then radical notion that students should be taught from

237
00:13:29.981 --> 00:13:33.550
textbooks. She also took education out of the hands of the church.

238
00:13:34.120 --> 00:13:37.300
Ensuring subjects were taught by people who knew what they were talking about,

239
00:13:37.330 --> 00:13:40.870
but the biggest change was the slow introduction of compulsory schooling.

240
00:13:40.930 --> 00:13:44.800
The first step towards universal primary education, of course,

241
00:13:44.920 --> 00:13:47.650
for Maria to raise the point of all of this wasn't to educate the populace,

242
00:13:47.651 --> 00:13:49.840
but to quickly train the educated class,

243
00:13:50.140 --> 00:13:53.590
her other reforms called for that's what we meant by efficiency,

244
00:13:53.830 --> 00:13:56.500
but higher efficiency still came with a giants.

245
00:13:56.530 --> 00:14:01.120
If accidental dose of enlightenment ideals take a economic

246
00:14:01.121 --> 00:14:04.300
reform of physio, cracy at its most basic physio.

247
00:14:04.630 --> 00:14:07.900
Cracy suggested that a higher birth rate would produce more workers,

248
00:14:07.901 --> 00:14:11.320
which would make the empire richer realizing that ill-treated peasants.

249
00:14:11.321 --> 00:14:13.330
Weren't able to sustain packs of children.

250
00:14:13.480 --> 00:14:17.230
Maria Theresa eliminated the rights of feudal overlords to dominate their

251
00:14:17.650 --> 00:14:19.780
peasants lives. She also overhauled healthcare,

252
00:14:19.930 --> 00:14:22.300
seeing the death rates about women during childbirth,

253
00:14:22.301 --> 00:14:25.660
Maria Theresa founded the first maternity hospitals and did obstetrics

254
00:14:25.661 --> 00:14:29.740
departments while also forcing midwives and qualifications instead of just

255
00:14:29.741 --> 00:14:30.820
improvising. Oh,

256
00:14:30.821 --> 00:14:34.270
and she also champions inoculation against smallpox putting a ahead of

257
00:14:34.271 --> 00:14:39.010
anti-vaxxers before there were even any vaccines to be anti about in

258
00:14:39.011 --> 00:14:41.350
short Maria Theresa completely overhauled her empire,

259
00:14:41.410 --> 00:14:44.440
dragging it into the modern world. So successful.

260
00:14:44.470 --> 00:14:47.920
When many of her reforms that they'd be taken up by other European leaders,

261
00:14:48.160 --> 00:14:52.220
adding to the era of enlightened absolutism. Now sweeping the continent.

262
00:14:52.280 --> 00:14:55.370
But while she's famous today as a reformer,

263
00:14:55.670 --> 00:14:59.990
that doesn't mean every reform Maria Theresa undertook was a good one.

264
00:15:00.350 --> 00:15:03.040
It's time. We took a hard look at the darker side of her,

265
00:15:09.970 --> 00:15:13.420
The hardcore Catholic Maria Theresa naturally disliked anything that smacked of

266
00:15:13.421 --> 00:15:17.260
heresy. Unfortunately, that included a good number of her own subjects.

267
00:15:17.290 --> 00:15:19.780
The first target of our prejudices were Protestants,

268
00:15:19.900 --> 00:15:23.980
even though the Counter-Reformation had been dead and buried for a century,

269
00:15:24.160 --> 00:15:28.630
Maria, Theresa still felt Protestantism was fundamentally in legitimate.

270
00:15:28.780 --> 00:15:32.680
When it came time to resettle, depopulated lands in what is today, Romania.

271
00:15:32.740 --> 00:15:35.800
It wasn't Catholics that she shipped out that econ a living,

272
00:15:35.801 --> 00:15:38.110
but Protestants who'd been expelled from the cities,

273
00:15:38.470 --> 00:15:41.410
but at least this was still in keeping with a practical side.

274
00:15:41.440 --> 00:15:43.000
She had a region that needed saddling.

275
00:15:43.001 --> 00:15:46.060
So she sends her unwanted Protestants that the same,

276
00:15:46.090 --> 00:15:48.250
couldn't be sad of a persecution of the Jews,

277
00:15:48.310 --> 00:15:50.770
despite the Jewish community in Prague, dating back centuries,

278
00:15:50.771 --> 00:15:54.520
Maria Theresa kicks off a rain by expelling. At 20,000 of them,

279
00:15:54.580 --> 00:15:57.580
Jewish families were given almost no warning before their community.

280
00:15:57.640 --> 00:16:01.390
It was dissolved ending generations of tradition. And so I think I was thinking,

281
00:16:01.750 --> 00:16:05.260
Oh, that's just how things worked in the 18th century mysteries, his own son,

282
00:16:05.261 --> 00:16:05.621
Joseph,

283
00:16:05.621 --> 00:16:10.150
the second would pass a law right after she died and doing most of anti-Jewish

284
00:16:10.151 --> 00:16:11.920
legislation. The other minority,

285
00:16:11.921 --> 00:16:14.950
Maria Theresa had no truck where there was anyone who didn't believe in

286
00:16:14.951 --> 00:16:19.540
God-fearing Catholic marriage, unsurprisingly, this included gay people.

287
00:16:19.570 --> 00:16:23.620
It also included anyone who committed adultery and even Catholics who dead to

288
00:16:23.621 --> 00:16:25.840
have sex with Protestants to enforce this.

289
00:16:25.841 --> 00:16:30.400
She introduced a chastity course that could order anything from whipping to

290
00:16:30.401 --> 00:16:35.200
deportation to execution that's if they survive the torture.

291
00:16:35.770 --> 00:16:37.000
Yup. Torture. Well,

292
00:16:37.001 --> 00:16:40.060
a general move to outlaw torture was gathering steam across Europe,

293
00:16:40.090 --> 00:16:41.410
Maria Theresa resisted it,

294
00:16:41.411 --> 00:16:44.710
believing the practice was still necessary and useful. Finally,

295
00:16:44.740 --> 00:16:48.400
there was a toxic relationship with her son in 1765. Friends,

296
00:16:48.760 --> 00:16:52.450
Steven died leaving Maria Theresa heartbroken the very next day she elevated her

297
00:16:52.451 --> 00:16:53.350
eldest son, Joseph.

298
00:16:53.350 --> 00:16:57.310
The second two are co regions successfully getting him likewise installed as

299
00:16:57.311 --> 00:17:01.120
Holy Roman emperor. But as long as she was alive, that was no doubt.

300
00:17:01.240 --> 00:17:02.440
She was really in charge.

301
00:17:02.500 --> 00:17:06.490
This was unfortunate because Joseph had inherited his mother's reforming zeal

302
00:17:06.520 --> 00:17:09.610
boosted even further by his enlightenment beliefs.

303
00:17:09.670 --> 00:17:11.410
This meant toleration for other religions,

304
00:17:11.411 --> 00:17:15.610
extended rights for the very poorest and open admiration for a mega reformer

305
00:17:15.630 --> 00:17:20.110
Frederick. The great soundly, all anathema to Maria Theresa is the,

306
00:17:20.111 --> 00:17:21.640
we had results was the Marie-Therese.

307
00:17:21.641 --> 00:17:25.360
I spent the first half of her reign transforming our empire and the second half

308
00:17:25.390 --> 00:17:29.890
fighting tooth and nail to stop her son from taking those reforms to their

309
00:17:29.900 --> 00:17:32.380
logical conclusions. But we shouldn't write her off.

310
00:17:32.440 --> 00:17:36.880
As I may have precast to Josephs. Although overhauls were baby steps,

311
00:17:36.881 --> 00:17:41.080
they were genuinely groundbreaking for the time taking place years before other

312
00:17:41.081 --> 00:17:42.220
reformers like Catherine,

313
00:17:42.221 --> 00:17:46.600
the great arrived on the scene and certainly decades before Napoleon.

314
00:17:46.660 --> 00:17:50.850
If it hadn't been for having to share consonant with the great it's likely Maria

315
00:17:51.510 --> 00:17:55.830
Teresa would likely have been by far the most significant Monica at a time,

316
00:17:55.980 --> 00:17:59.250
but there were other ways that she was significant for Europe too. It's time.

317
00:17:59.280 --> 00:18:04.050
We took a look at Maria Teresa's other great skill, marriage, diplomacy.

318
00:18:10.850 --> 00:18:11.060
<v 3>Practicality.</v>

319
00:18:11.060 --> 00:18:11.781
<v 0>It was water driven.</v>

320
00:18:11.781 --> 00:18:16.220
Maria Theresa's reforms it's certainly was what governs our attitude to family,

321
00:18:16.370 --> 00:18:17.990
her kids. Weren't living children,

322
00:18:17.991 --> 00:18:21.590
but commodities to invest in or else Mary off to powerful rulers.

323
00:18:21.620 --> 00:18:24.050
And no one did marriage diplomacy quite like Maria,

324
00:18:24.650 --> 00:18:26.180
Theresa starting in the 1750s.

325
00:18:26.181 --> 00:18:29.450
She decided to neutralize the French threats by marrying as many of our

326
00:18:29.451 --> 00:18:34.040
daughters to as many bobbin princes as humanly possible famously.

327
00:18:34.041 --> 00:18:38.180
This included Marie Antoinette, it's known in Austria as Maria Antonia,

328
00:18:38.210 --> 00:18:40.370
who was sent to France to Mary Lou the 16th,

329
00:18:40.400 --> 00:18:42.530
but it also included nearly all her other girls,

330
00:18:42.680 --> 00:18:45.500
nearly all called Maria Maria Karoleena. For example,

331
00:18:45.501 --> 00:18:49.970
was dumped into King Ferdinand of Naples and Sicily rule-out once described as

332
00:18:49.971 --> 00:18:54.590
both uncouth and mentally retarded Maria AMA Lee begged not to be forced to

333
00:18:54.591 --> 00:18:58.550
marry the Duke of Palmer only to find herself on happily walking down the aisle

334
00:18:58.700 --> 00:19:00.680
with him. Even when marriage was concerned,

335
00:19:00.710 --> 00:19:04.100
there was a ruthlessness to Maria Teresa. When Maria Elizabeth,

336
00:19:04.101 --> 00:19:05.780
his good looks were ruined by smallpox.

337
00:19:05.810 --> 00:19:09.020
She was entirely removed from the mother's marriage schemes and left an

338
00:19:09.021 --> 00:19:11.240
isolation to go half matte. In fact,

339
00:19:11.241 --> 00:19:15.140
the only daughter Maria Theresa extended the same courtesy a father had to her

340
00:19:15.290 --> 00:19:16.520
was Maria, Christina.

341
00:19:16.550 --> 00:19:20.570
She was allowed to marry for love and to do pretty much as she pleased the rest

342
00:19:20.571 --> 00:19:23.720
of this gigantic brood of Maria has spent their entire lives controlled and

343
00:19:23.721 --> 00:19:28.100
dominated by that powerful mother. This was a key part of marriage diplomacy.

344
00:19:28.310 --> 00:19:30.260
The daughters installed in helpful locations.

345
00:19:30.261 --> 00:19:33.980
Maria Teresa would write to them telling them exactly what to do and how to

346
00:19:33.981 --> 00:19:34.580
behave.

347
00:19:34.580 --> 00:19:38.720
It drove Maria internet bonkers causing her to confide in her XY friends,

348
00:19:38.721 --> 00:19:42.290
that her mother was a dreadful old cow. She may have had a point.

349
00:19:42.320 --> 00:19:46.010
Maria Theresa seems to have regarded all of our daughters as inherently stupid

350
00:19:46.011 --> 00:19:49.100
and in need of berating. Like the times she had bluntly told one of them,

351
00:19:49.370 --> 00:19:53.050
the less you speak the better I know the manner in which you chatter away and

352
00:19:53.060 --> 00:19:54.380
must tell you as a friends,

353
00:19:54.590 --> 00:19:59.330
that it is very tedious and lauded with all sorts of platitudes, ouch,

354
00:19:59.540 --> 00:20:02.690
but the children were more than just Canon invite for marriages.

355
00:20:02.720 --> 00:20:04.640
They were PR tools to Maria.

356
00:20:05.030 --> 00:20:08.510
Theresa knew from experience that being a female ruler was often a handicap,

357
00:20:08.540 --> 00:20:11.750
but she knew it could also work to her advantage.

358
00:20:11.810 --> 00:20:15.260
When invariable male diplomats arrived from foreign lands, she'd greet them.

359
00:20:15.320 --> 00:20:18.590
The company it's about all her children, projecting womanly virtues,

360
00:20:18.591 --> 00:20:21.980
like motherliness and caring that convinced these stuffy dudes.

361
00:20:21.981 --> 00:20:25.580
She wasn't a threat. It was cold. It was calculating.

362
00:20:26.000 --> 00:20:28.850
It was unfair to our kids. And it also works.

363
00:20:29.120 --> 00:20:31.640
Thanks to this practical attitude towards her offspring,

364
00:20:31.850 --> 00:20:35.960
Maria Teresa was able to turn the French into our allies to make enemy States

365
00:20:36.440 --> 00:20:37.970
into grudging friends. Well,

366
00:20:38.060 --> 00:20:41.360
at least until the French Rose up and chopped off her daughter's hat,

367
00:20:41.480 --> 00:20:44.780
but that is a tale for another video. All in all.

368
00:20:44.781 --> 00:20:48.730
Then Maria Theresa's family diplomacy was at quad and in Europe,

369
00:20:49.000 --> 00:20:53.050
at least for a time, sadly time was something Maria Teresa, no,

370
00:20:59.880 --> 00:21:03.960
The slow March toward the end of Maria Teresa's life began on August the 18th,

371
00:21:03.961 --> 00:21:07.860
1765. That day friends Steven died suddenly ripping away.

372
00:21:07.861 --> 00:21:10.830
The one person she truly adored. Although some Joseph,

373
00:21:10.831 --> 00:21:12.900
the second would be elevated to co regions.

374
00:21:12.901 --> 00:21:16.890
The effect Fran Stephen's death had on her would be catastrophic for the rest of

375
00:21:16.891 --> 00:21:19.020
her life. Maria Theresa workloads that morning,

376
00:21:19.140 --> 00:21:20.640
she stopped attending public events,

377
00:21:20.970 --> 00:21:24.420
close herself away and slipped into something that looks suspiciously like

378
00:21:24.450 --> 00:21:25.260
depression.

379
00:21:25.260 --> 00:21:29.100
The most pathetic remnants of this time is probably a piece of paper found after

380
00:21:29.280 --> 00:21:32.880
she died. And it should work out exactly how long the marriage had lost it.

381
00:21:33.060 --> 00:21:36.870
29 years, six months, six days, that makes 29 years,

382
00:21:36.990 --> 00:21:40.860
335 months, 1,540 weeks,

383
00:21:40.920 --> 00:21:43.260
10,781 days,

384
00:21:43.320 --> 00:21:46.470
258,744 hours.

385
00:21:46.680 --> 00:21:49.740
It was around this time that she also became increasingly conservative.

386
00:21:49.770 --> 00:21:53.640
We've already mentioned how Maria Teresa changed from a reformer into someone

387
00:21:53.700 --> 00:21:56.370
fighting her son's edicts at every turn. Well,

388
00:21:56.371 --> 00:22:00.120
this about face also applied to foreign policy ever since the war of Austrian

389
00:22:00.121 --> 00:22:04.470
succession, Maria Theresa had promoted herself as the impressive piece.

390
00:22:04.471 --> 00:22:08.580
Someone who wanted to stop war coming to Europe, but in 1772,

391
00:22:08.610 --> 00:22:12.060
she took pallets along with pressure and Russia in the first partition of

392
00:22:12.061 --> 00:22:16.500
Poland, annexing, Galicia, and threatening the entire balance of Europe.

393
00:22:16.680 --> 00:22:20.220
As I roll down to me, Frederick, the great stared at a reluctant annexation.

394
00:22:20.310 --> 00:22:24.300
She wept, but she took nonetheless as the years, began to mountains up.

395
00:22:24.301 --> 00:22:28.290
Maria Theresa started to fail physically from alive athletic women.

396
00:22:28.291 --> 00:22:32.100
She became badly overweight, a son, a future, Holy Roman, emperor Leopold.

397
00:22:32.101 --> 00:22:35.160
The second wrote despairingly owing her agents at corpulence.

398
00:22:35.190 --> 00:22:37.800
She is beginning to have great difficulty in walking.

399
00:22:38.010 --> 00:22:40.050
Her memory has deteriorated considerably.

400
00:22:40.080 --> 00:22:42.240
She mistrusts herself and everybody else.

401
00:22:42.480 --> 00:22:47.220
She never enjoys anything and is constantly alone and melancholic at lost.

402
00:22:47.400 --> 00:22:51.840
Her alien body gave out completely Maria Theresa died of pneumonia on November

403
00:22:51.841 --> 00:22:54.600
the 29th, 1780 age 63,

404
00:22:54.630 --> 00:22:57.630
she was buried in Vienna alongside her beloved friend, Steven,

405
00:22:57.780 --> 00:23:02.370
the PA finally reunited after a decade and a half apart at the moment of her

406
00:23:02.371 --> 00:23:03.000
passing,

407
00:23:03.000 --> 00:23:06.780
it wasn't clear how Maria Teresa would be remembered or reforms that had once

408
00:23:06.781 --> 00:23:11.070
seemed so revolutionary now looked like mere tinkering compared to those of

409
00:23:11.071 --> 00:23:13.140
Joseph. The second, not a decade later,

410
00:23:13.200 --> 00:23:16.170
even Joseph's reform is pale in comparison with the changes,

411
00:23:16.171 --> 00:23:18.710
the French revolution unleashed against all that came after.

412
00:23:18.720 --> 00:23:21.630
What were the basic practical changes that Maria Theresa had made.

413
00:23:21.930 --> 00:23:23.430
But this wasn't the story's ends.

414
00:23:23.550 --> 00:23:26.850
As the years marched on it soon became clear that Maria Theresa had laid the

415
00:23:26.851 --> 00:23:30.900
foundations for Austria's golden age. As the empire lived longer and longer,

416
00:23:30.901 --> 00:23:32.340
all the way into the 20th century.

417
00:23:32.520 --> 00:23:36.330
It started to look more and more like Maria Teresa's practical spirit had been

418
00:23:36.360 --> 00:23:39.270
perfect for a time and place today. Of course,

419
00:23:39.271 --> 00:23:41.250
with Austria's emperor over a century,

420
00:23:41.251 --> 00:23:45.030
dead are far more likely to remember other aspects of Maria Theresa's.

421
00:23:45.650 --> 00:23:49.550
He was a powerful woman who didn't just manage to rule at a time when ovaries

422
00:23:49.580 --> 00:23:51.680
could have disqualified her from the top spot,

423
00:23:51.950 --> 00:23:56.030
but did so with a force and passion that made her one of the most influential

424
00:23:56.031 --> 00:23:57.590
monarchs in Europe as a height.

425
00:23:57.740 --> 00:24:01.760
She bends both Austria and Europe to her well and did so in a way that benefited

426
00:24:01.761 --> 00:24:04.190
millions. She may have been religiously intolerance.

427
00:24:04.220 --> 00:24:08.210
She may have lived long enough to become an obstacle to reform rather than its

428
00:24:08.211 --> 00:24:08.840
driver.

429
00:24:08.840 --> 00:24:13.550
But Maria Teresa was a ruler who saw off all of her rivals to rain for 40 long

430
00:24:13.760 --> 00:24:17.360
years in doing so. She ensured not just Austria survival,

431
00:24:17.570 --> 00:24:20.900
but our place among Europe's greatest emperors.

432
00:24:21.170 --> 00:24:23.540
