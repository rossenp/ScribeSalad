00:00:11.550 --> 00:00:15.750
Jack out Squarespace through the link in the description below more on them in a

6
00:00:15.751 --> 00:00:16.584
bit,

7
00:00:22.190 --> 00:00:26.540
The science sufficient lies at the very heart of our ability to harness nuclear

8
00:00:26.541 --> 00:00:29.240
power, regardless of whether it's used for weapons,

9
00:00:29.241 --> 00:00:31.580
energy or some unknown purpose,

10
00:00:31.730 --> 00:00:35.720
we wouldn't have any of it had one of the world's most brilliant scientific

11
00:00:35.721 --> 00:00:39.170
minds not unlocked its secrets in 1944,

12
00:00:39.171 --> 00:00:43.190
the Nobel committee awarded a German scientist named Otto Hahn,

13
00:00:43.400 --> 00:00:47.780
the Nobel prize in chemistry. It was for his discovery of nuclear fission.

14
00:00:47.930 --> 00:00:52.370
And he would go on to be known as the so-called father of nuclear chemistry.

15
00:00:52.910 --> 00:00:55.760
Han was a brilliant researcher, scientist and chemists.

16
00:00:55.790 --> 00:01:00.230
So that's all well and good, but it's only part of the story.

17
00:01:00.320 --> 00:01:02.720
He didn't conduct his research alone. In fact,

18
00:01:02.750 --> 00:01:05.420
when it came time to publicly explain his findings,

19
00:01:05.660 --> 00:01:08.810
he had some difficulty articulating the very science.

20
00:01:08.811 --> 00:01:13.580
He was given credit for pioneering that's because it was another researcher

21
00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:18.410
who did much of the work before she was purposefully excluded from the

22
00:01:18.411 --> 00:01:21.650
published paper because she was female and Jewish.

23
00:01:21.710 --> 00:01:26.120
Her name was Lisa Meitner errands in the decades. Following Hans Nobel prize.

24
00:01:26.210 --> 00:01:30.530
Her continued anonymity has been consistently identified as one of the most

25
00:01:30.531 --> 00:01:34.880
blatant instances of sexism and prejudice in the scientific community.

26
00:01:42.260 --> 00:01:45.110
Mike Miller was born in Vienna in 1878, though.

27
00:01:45.111 --> 00:01:47.510
There is some debate about that exact date.

28
00:01:47.750 --> 00:01:50.870
She had always observed her birthday on November the seventh,

29
00:01:50.871 --> 00:01:54.950
but according to official records, she had been born on November the 17th.

30
00:01:55.010 --> 00:01:57.380
Just why there is a difference in dates. Isn't clear,

31
00:01:57.530 --> 00:02:00.560
perhaps it was a cleric Alara no one cared enough to fix.

32
00:02:00.561 --> 00:02:04.340
It's also been suggested that a parent's Hedwig and Philip might not

33
00:02:04.550 --> 00:02:08.420
intentionally delayed their submission of all the proper paperwork regardless.

34
00:02:08.450 --> 00:02:13.280
Lisa's birth stands in sharp contrast to other parts of Europe where

35
00:02:13.281 --> 00:02:16.100
such an era would have caused chaos for Mike. Nah,

36
00:02:16.220 --> 00:02:18.110
it just didn't seem to matter up.

37
00:02:18.140 --> 00:02:21.380
The mountain of family had only moved to Vienna fairly recently. In fact,

38
00:02:21.381 --> 00:02:24.380
it was only recently that they had adopted their last name.

39
00:02:24.440 --> 00:02:28.040
It was a gift from her great, great grandfather who adopted the name,

40
00:02:28.070 --> 00:02:31.880
my thinner as a nod to that ancestral home in Moravia,

41
00:02:31.910 --> 00:02:35.060
they hadn't bothered with a surname before and only added one.

42
00:02:35.060 --> 00:02:35.990
When Connie's of Joseph.

43
00:02:36.050 --> 00:02:40.130
The second is mandated the use of a surname for any family availing themselves

44
00:02:40.131 --> 00:02:42.740
of civil services, like education and employment.

45
00:02:42.860 --> 00:02:46.610
And this was the first time the family enjoyed the benefits that others took for

46
00:02:46.611 --> 00:02:50.240
granted others. That is who weren't Jewish,

47
00:02:50.300 --> 00:02:52.850
just a few generations later, the Kaiser's edict.

48
00:02:53.030 --> 00:02:54.800
So it opens the doors of the center.

49
00:02:55.040 --> 00:02:59.150
It was a bustling hub of liberal advancements and sure it was crowded,

50
00:02:59.320 --> 00:03:03.730
highly unsanitary plagues by cholera and the suicide rate was high.

51
00:03:03.790 --> 00:03:07.090
But for the first time the Jewish men and women found themselves eligible for

52
00:03:07.091 --> 00:03:10.990
full participation in activities and occupations that were previously off

53
00:03:10.991 --> 00:03:12.040
limits. Pellet bike.

54
00:03:12.250 --> 00:03:15.280
Now was one of the first Jewish man who could study and practice law.

55
00:03:15.340 --> 00:03:18.670
And the social standing afforded to him by his occupation in the city,

56
00:03:18.880 --> 00:03:23.140
allowed him to open up his home to all the Vienna's most progressive citizens.

57
00:03:23.200 --> 00:03:23.890
They might know home.

58
00:03:23.890 --> 00:03:28.420
Then Leopold starts just a Stone's throw from the Daniel canal was a gathering

59
00:03:28.421 --> 00:03:31.030
place for politicians, lawmakers, and entertainers.

60
00:03:31.120 --> 00:03:34.210
At times they would discuss the future of their beloved city,

61
00:03:34.240 --> 00:03:38.800
but often they just wanted to play chess and socialize with other free thinking

62
00:03:38.801 --> 00:03:41.350
individuals. Lisa was the third of eight children.

63
00:03:41.500 --> 00:03:43.480
Her family was by no means rich,

64
00:03:43.510 --> 00:03:47.590
but they were comfortably middle-class because her family had enough money to

65
00:03:47.591 --> 00:03:48.430
pursue hobbies.

66
00:03:48.460 --> 00:03:52.240
She and her siblings were encouraged to explore the world around them and find

67
00:03:52.241 --> 00:03:55.480
that passions, the siblings all studied music. And for Lisa,

68
00:03:55.510 --> 00:03:59.800
the days she spent playing the piano as a child sparked passion that lasted for

69
00:03:59.801 --> 00:04:03.220
the rest of her life. But when it came to matters of more formal education,

70
00:04:03.250 --> 00:04:07.120
she was at a major disadvantage simply because she was a girl.

71
00:04:07.270 --> 00:04:11.410
Fortunately Lisa's parents were adamant that all their children would receive a

72
00:04:11.411 --> 00:04:12.790
similar opportunities in life.

73
00:04:12.790 --> 00:04:17.270
So they hired private teachers and tutors to help keep everyone up to speed and

74
00:04:17.580 --> 00:04:21.130
likeness studied subjects like math, but only basic bookkeeping.

75
00:04:21.160 --> 00:04:24.190
Along with history, some geography and a bit of science.

76
00:04:24.250 --> 00:04:28.450
There were also a few subjects that seems a bit out of touch today. Singing,

77
00:04:28.480 --> 00:04:32.740
drawing, gymnastics, and something that was simply called feminine handiwork,

78
00:04:32.980 --> 00:04:36.730
but all subjects that she studied, the teachers noted that her grades were good,

79
00:04:36.760 --> 00:04:40.960
but her discipline was lacking. She was bored much later.

80
00:04:40.990 --> 00:04:45.250
Lisa would look back on early schooling with a small Pang of regret writing.

81
00:04:45.520 --> 00:04:49.060
Although I had a very marked Benz for mathematics and physics from my early

82
00:04:49.061 --> 00:04:52.150
years, I did not begin a life of study immediately.

83
00:04:52.180 --> 00:04:54.130
Thinking back to the time of my youth,

84
00:04:54.250 --> 00:04:58.570
one realizes with some astonishments how many problems then existed in the lives

85
00:04:58.571 --> 00:04:59.980
of ordinary young girls,

86
00:05:00.160 --> 00:05:04.840
which now seem almost unimaginable among the most difficult of these problems

87
00:05:04.841 --> 00:05:08.170
was the possibility of normal intellectual training.

88
00:05:08.380 --> 00:05:12.130
By the time Lisa and her sisters were looking for secondary education options.

89
00:05:12.310 --> 00:05:16.060
The firm glass ceiling that had been in place was beginning to crumble.

90
00:05:16.150 --> 00:05:17.530
When it came to educating women,

91
00:05:17.560 --> 00:05:21.100
there were only two countries where aspiring female students faced more

92
00:05:21.101 --> 00:05:25.510
opposition than they did in Austria. And that was Turkey and Germany.

93
00:05:26.140 --> 00:05:29.470
Austria had bought women for university for a long time, but in 1897,

94
00:05:29.471 --> 00:05:33.790
women were finally granted access to higher education. Even as university,

95
00:05:33.850 --> 00:05:37.000
it became a viable option. New problems emerged for one thing,

96
00:05:37.001 --> 00:05:40.630
all these new troublemakers were required to pass entrance exams in order to

97
00:05:40.631 --> 00:05:42.880
gain access to universities. Fortunately,

98
00:05:42.890 --> 00:05:45.880
the girls of the mine family had been well-prepared by that parents,

99
00:05:45.940 --> 00:05:49.930
elder sister just sell a pollster exams and did medical school in 1900.

100
00:05:50.170 --> 00:05:54.190
And Lisa pushed herself to compress eight years of schooling down into two.

101
00:05:54.310 --> 00:05:58.640
She studied mathematics, physics, mineralogy, logic, religion, Latin, Greek,

102
00:05:58.790 --> 00:05:59.623
and botany.

103
00:05:59.750 --> 00:06:03.530
It was a long and difficult periods during which a family said that they never

104
00:06:03.531 --> 00:06:06.740
saw her without a book of some kind in the end, though,

105
00:06:07.130 --> 00:06:10.610
all of that hard work paid off when Lisa Meitner turns 21,

106
00:06:10.611 --> 00:06:14.030
she enrolled at the university of Vienna and became the first woman to study

107
00:06:14.031 --> 00:06:18.500
physics that when she graduated, she was only the second female students to an,

108
00:06:18.510 --> 00:06:19.610
a PhD from the school

109
00:06:26.410 --> 00:06:27.940
I with studying at university.

110
00:06:27.941 --> 00:06:31.480
She found a teacher who encouraged her to enter the field of physics that was

111
00:06:31.870 --> 00:06:32.531
Ludovic Boltzmann,

112
00:06:32.531 --> 00:06:36.400
a physicist who also graduated from the university and worked in statistical

113
00:06:36.401 --> 00:06:37.234
mechanics.

114
00:06:37.330 --> 00:06:41.740
Boltzmann was a little different than the other professors and authority figures

115
00:06:41.741 --> 00:06:42.670
that should match this.

116
00:06:42.880 --> 00:06:46.150
He accepted women in fields of higher learning without hesitation.

117
00:06:46.240 --> 00:06:48.790
He was married to a maths and physics teacher.

118
00:06:48.791 --> 00:06:53.140
And after role might have describes him as a pure soul full of goodness of heart

119
00:06:53.350 --> 00:06:57.340
idealism and reverends. For the wonder of the natural order of things.

120
00:06:57.490 --> 00:07:01.990
By the time I met him, Boltzmann was already struggling with ill health in 1906,

121
00:07:01.991 --> 00:07:03.580
Boltzmann took his own life.

122
00:07:03.700 --> 00:07:07.540
It was a tragic events yet one that would serendipitously lead to a meeting.

123
00:07:08.260 --> 00:07:11.620
What changed Mike and his life among those who traveled to Vienna to pay their

124
00:07:11.621 --> 00:07:16.390
respects of Boltzmann's funeral was max plank. The father of quantum theory,

125
00:07:16.660 --> 00:07:18.430
he had Sue was a potential roadblock.

126
00:07:19.030 --> 00:07:22.000
Planchet unconditionally refused to welcome women to his lectures,

127
00:07:22.001 --> 00:07:22.960
but they might not.

128
00:07:23.050 --> 00:07:27.100
He made an exception sort of when she picks up and to move to Berlin,

129
00:07:27.101 --> 00:07:29.680
to continue our studies. She found that even though playing good,

130
00:07:29.710 --> 00:07:31.240
opens the door to his lectures,

131
00:07:31.450 --> 00:07:35.800
the doors do the practical experiments or laboratories were still firmly shut

132
00:07:36.130 --> 00:07:40.630
and locked tight. And the university of Berlin is where Mike numb met Otto Hahn.

133
00:07:40.750 --> 00:07:44.770
The chemist wheat mentioned before he was working and a somewhat improvised

134
00:07:44.771 --> 00:07:45.910
radio chemistry lab.

135
00:07:45.911 --> 00:07:49.270
And since it was completely separate from planks off limits of the trees

136
00:07:49.860 --> 00:07:52.090
complete with a separate entrance and everything,

137
00:07:52.270 --> 00:07:54.970
she could go there to study and research.

138
00:07:55.150 --> 00:07:57.310
She would be an unpaid assistant of course,

139
00:07:57.340 --> 00:08:00.700
but given the uphill battle she was facing for acceptance,

140
00:08:00.701 --> 00:08:04.690
she knew she couldn't underestimate the value of a foot in the door.

141
00:08:04.960 --> 00:08:08.050
And if you're looking the great value from something you should definitely

142
00:08:08.051 --> 00:08:11.980
consider today's sponsor Squarespace. Now, a couple of simple things, but one,

143
00:08:12.130 --> 00:08:16.300
maybe you've got some idea for a business or a website in your minds kind of

144
00:08:16.301 --> 00:08:20.050
knocking around. Ooh, is that a good idea? Well, number two,

145
00:08:20.320 --> 00:08:21.760
you don't know if that's a good idea,

146
00:08:21.790 --> 00:08:23.980
unless you get it out there into the world.

147
00:08:24.190 --> 00:08:26.290
And I know that can be daunting because you know,

148
00:08:26.440 --> 00:08:28.180
pursuing new things kind of is,

149
00:08:28.181 --> 00:08:31.360
but not knowing how to set up a website is not an excuse.

150
00:08:31.361 --> 00:08:34.840
There are no excuses available with Squarespace.

151
00:08:35.080 --> 00:08:38.290

00:08:41.230 --> 00:08:44.530
Easy to set up a store with Squarespace or a podcast,

154
00:08:44.920 --> 00:08:46.960
or maybe starting a YouTube channel,

155
00:08:47.170 --> 00:08:50.620
or you want a website to compliment that it all starts on Squarespace with a

156
00:08:50.621 --> 00:08:53.560
beautiful template that you can customize your heart's content,

157
00:08:53.680 --> 00:08:58.470
or you can from scratch or easily move over from an

158
00:08:58.471 --> 00:09:01.800
existing domain, making everything super easy to manage.

159
00:09:01.830 --> 00:09:06.360
Don't start from scratch. Just use a template, no excuses.

160
00:09:06.830 --> 00:09:09.870

And let's get back to the video,

172
00:09:54.560 --> 00:09:56.810
Not work side by side for a long time.

173
00:09:56.990 --> 00:10:00.650
And it was a partnership that was interrupted several times by some of the most

174
00:10:00.651 --> 00:10:05.180
iconic events of the 20th century. Even in the small makeshift lab,

175
00:10:05.210 --> 00:10:08.240
the dynamic duo had momentous days of achievements,

176
00:10:08.241 --> 00:10:10.790
including the discovery of several new isotypes.

177
00:10:10.880 --> 00:10:14.450
It was during this time that my not also wrote and presented several papers on

178
00:10:14.451 --> 00:10:16.670
beta radiation by 1912,

179
00:10:16.700 --> 00:10:21.470
hardened might not still operating under the lead assistant paradigm had moved

180
00:10:21.471 --> 00:10:25.130
from their makeshift basement laboratory to the Kaiser Ville helm,

181
00:10:25.131 --> 00:10:26.030
gazelle shaft,

182
00:10:26.300 --> 00:10:29.540
where Han accepted a position as the head of the radioactivity Institute.

183
00:10:29.720 --> 00:10:34.190
It was a huge step up, but it wasn't long before the outbreak of world war one,

184
00:10:34.460 --> 00:10:38.690
but their work on hold Hom spent the warriors working under Fritz Harbor and

185
00:10:38.870 --> 00:10:42.080
researching the use of chemical weapons. By all accounts,

186
00:10:42.081 --> 00:10:45.440
his participation was unwilling chemical weapons schools,

187
00:10:45.441 --> 00:10:47.810
less than 1% of world war, one fatalities,

188
00:10:47.811 --> 00:10:52.070
but the physical and psychological effects of the use led to the Geneva

189
00:10:52.071 --> 00:10:52.700
conventions,

190
00:10:52.700 --> 00:10:57.440
prohibition of such weapons in future conflicts while Han blade war chemist

191
00:10:57.470 --> 00:10:57.891
might know,

192
00:10:57.891 --> 00:11:01.610
volunteered with the Austrian army as a nurse working mostly with x-ray

193
00:11:01.611 --> 00:11:05.150
technology, they didn't return to civilian life until 1917.

194
00:11:05.450 --> 00:11:09.860
At which point they returned to their work. That's the key WG by this time,

195
00:11:09.861 --> 00:11:11.780
my no is no longer a mirror assistant.

196
00:11:11.810 --> 00:11:15.050
She was appointed to the head of the institutes physics division.

197
00:11:15.170 --> 00:11:18.830
She had been recognized for a work and to have potential, certainly,

198
00:11:18.980 --> 00:11:23.120
but there were plenty of reminders that her abilities were viewed with a double

199
00:11:23.121 --> 00:11:27.200
dose of skepticism when she became Berlin university's first female professor in

200
00:11:27.201 --> 00:11:28.160
1926,

201
00:11:28.400 --> 00:11:32.600
Lisa gave her first lecture on radioactivity and cosmic physics.

202
00:11:32.690 --> 00:11:35.510
It's an unthinkably complicated subject,

203
00:11:35.600 --> 00:11:39.710
and it was also reported as a section of cosmetic physics,

204
00:11:39.890 --> 00:11:41.030
typo or not.

205
00:11:41.031 --> 00:11:45.110
It represented a common problem for how women were viewed in the workplace at

206
00:11:45.111 --> 00:11:48.740
the time minor and Han made a number of subatomic particle discoveries

207
00:11:48.741 --> 00:11:52.100
throughout the 1920s and regularly published their research.

208
00:11:52.130 --> 00:11:54.040
But it wasn't until the of world war two,

209
00:11:54.041 --> 00:11:58.360
that James Chadwick's discovery of the neutron gave the field a major boost,

210
00:11:58.420 --> 00:12:01.930
suddenly researchers while hypothesizing that it would be possible to create a

211
00:12:01.931 --> 00:12:03.130
new elements in the lab.

212
00:12:03.130 --> 00:12:07.840
And teams of scientists were racing to see who could get that first minor.

213
00:12:07.930 --> 00:12:09.760
And hadn't added two more crucial elements,

214
00:12:09.761 --> 00:12:11.920
no pun intended to their research team.

215
00:12:12.490 --> 00:12:16.270
Fritch Strassman and minus nephew also fresh together.

216
00:12:16.271 --> 00:12:20.380
They began trying to identify the decay patterns that formed when uranium was

217
00:12:20.381 --> 00:12:23.140
bombarded by the recently discovered neutrons.

218
00:12:23.500 --> 00:12:25.900
And here is where things get complicated,

219
00:12:25.901 --> 00:12:28.750
not just for Meitner hon and their partnership,

220
00:12:28.990 --> 00:12:32.260
but for pretty much everyone else. The Nazi policy of, again,

221
00:12:32.261 --> 00:12:34.740
consolidating power in Europe at this time.

222
00:12:34.741 --> 00:12:39.630
And remember my no wasn't just female. She was also from a Jewish family, hates,

223
00:12:39.690 --> 00:12:43.410
runs deep while their parents had never really been practicing Jews that

224
00:12:43.411 --> 00:12:46.230
children all had registered within the Jewish community.

225
00:12:46.290 --> 00:12:49.290
Even though the children had actively accepted different faiths,

226
00:12:49.320 --> 00:12:52.120
minus sisters were baptized Catholics, Bob,

227
00:12:52.320 --> 00:12:54.300
she herself attended Protestant services.

228
00:12:54.660 --> 00:12:58.260
It just didn't matter to the Nazis that heritage was Jewish.

229
00:12:58.650 --> 00:13:03.180
And that's all that was seen in the end as Hitler Rose to power minus or other

230
00:13:03.181 --> 00:13:06.330
Jewish scientists she had worked with suddenly started to disappear.

231
00:13:06.720 --> 00:13:10.980
Even her nephew fled for a while. She was protected by her Austrian citizenship.

232
00:13:11.010 --> 00:13:14.880
She just kept her head down to avoid drawing any unnecessary attention to

233
00:13:14.881 --> 00:13:15.540
herself.

234
00:13:15.540 --> 00:13:19.140
Eventually she was officially dismissed from her position at the university of

235
00:13:19.141 --> 00:13:22.560
Berlin nuns while she kept conducting our research at the Institute,

236
00:13:22.800 --> 00:13:26.520
her name was stricken from the record and removed from any official documents

237
00:13:26.550 --> 00:13:31.530
pertaining to our findings pawn alone, received credit for her work. Lisa,

238
00:13:31.531 --> 00:13:35.010
trying to ignore the problem, focusing on her work and nothing else.

239
00:13:35.011 --> 00:13:37.290
But when Austria was annexed by Germany,

240
00:13:37.650 --> 00:13:40.710
it became clear that her life was no longer safe in Germany.

241
00:13:40.800 --> 00:13:44.790
She also realized that she didn't have the support of most of our colleagues

242
00:13:44.850 --> 00:13:49.620
consider the remarks of a coworker named cut has Sue remained very vocal

243
00:13:49.621 --> 00:13:52.530
about her continued presence in the research community? Oh,

244
00:13:52.531 --> 00:13:56.500
one point has lemons. Is this the Gus in danger,

245
00:13:56.560 --> 00:13:58.830
this Institute in July of 1938,

246
00:13:58.860 --> 00:14:01.140
a car dropped her off at a train station in Berlin.

247
00:14:01.290 --> 00:14:02.730
She had already stayed too long.

248
00:14:02.760 --> 00:14:05.940
There were now new laws in place and no scientists were allowed to leave the

249
00:14:05.941 --> 00:14:10.110
country or even to get documents that would allow them to do so. In the future,

250
00:14:10.200 --> 00:14:14.610
the train ride from Berlin to the Dutch border had to be unthinkably long and

251
00:14:14.670 --> 00:14:18.870
unbearably terrifying. She was traveling with a Dutch chemist named Dick Costa,

252
00:14:18.871 --> 00:14:22.020
and he had arranged for her to be welcomed to the Netherlands,

253
00:14:22.110 --> 00:14:24.300
but she had to get across the border first.

254
00:14:24.301 --> 00:14:28.410
And the only document she had was her outdated Austrian passport.

255
00:14:28.770 --> 00:14:29.670
In her later years,

256
00:14:30.060 --> 00:14:33.630
might've recalled sitting horrified as an officer of the Nazi military check

257
00:14:33.770 --> 00:14:38.010
tech credentials. I got so frightened. My heart almost stopped beating.

258
00:14:38.190 --> 00:14:42.390
I knew that the Nazis had just declared open season on the Jews that the hunt

259
00:14:42.391 --> 00:14:45.720
was on for 10 minutes. I sat there and waited 10 minutes.

260
00:14:45.721 --> 00:14:47.760
That seemed like so many hours.

261
00:14:47.910 --> 00:14:52.160
Then one of the Nazi officials returns and handed me back my passport without a

262
00:14:52.161 --> 00:14:55.070
word within just a few months. Mine was living in Stockholm.

263
00:14:55.130 --> 00:14:58.160
She and Han maintained correspondence. Even as Han continued,

264
00:14:58.161 --> 00:15:01.040
the experiments that worked on with the help of Straussman.

265
00:15:01.190 --> 00:15:04.760
They discovered that they could turn a radioactive substance into something that

266
00:15:04.761 --> 00:15:08.900
was almost barium, but not quite. It was much too license.

267
00:15:09.050 --> 00:15:12.620
They couldn't make heads or tails of what that founds mine. His nephew,

268
00:15:12.621 --> 00:15:16.490
who had moved to Copenhagen after his escape from Germany was visiting her that

269
00:15:16.491 --> 00:15:17.060
Christmas.

270
00:15:17.060 --> 00:15:21.500
The two report over the odd findings eventually arriving it's one inescapable

271
00:15:21.501 --> 00:15:24.800
truth. The uranium from their experiments had been split,

272
00:15:25.010 --> 00:15:26.450
releasing nuclear energy.

273
00:15:26.510 --> 00:15:30.680
They needed a name to refer to this process and they dubbed it. Fishing.

274
00:15:40.060 --> 00:15:43.060
Mine is Dutch discovery is where our story gets a little hazy.

275
00:15:43.270 --> 00:15:46.450
When it was time for Hunter publishes work and tell the world what that

276
00:15:46.451 --> 00:15:47.284
discovered.

277
00:15:47.320 --> 00:15:50.800
He had to carefully consider what names he should attribute to the project.

278
00:15:50.860 --> 00:15:54.010
Technically it was he and Strassman who conducted the experiments,

279
00:15:54.011 --> 00:15:56.860
but it was Mike who had told him what to look for.

280
00:15:56.920 --> 00:16:00.640
She was also the chief architect behind the interpretation of the results and

281
00:16:01.060 --> 00:16:03.610
Walnut plainly seems like they should have shared credits.

282
00:16:04.150 --> 00:16:08.650
Han knew that adding a Jewish women's name to his work from the house of Nazi

283
00:16:08.680 --> 00:16:11.050
Germany would have all but destroyed his career.

284
00:16:11.080 --> 00:16:15.040
So he published his paper on fishing without giving her any mention.

285
00:16:15.190 --> 00:16:17.980
There was a little bit of Epic justice here that went on,

286
00:16:17.981 --> 00:16:21.430
published his findings. He left out a fairly important bits.

287
00:16:21.440 --> 00:16:25.900
That explains exactly how uranium could be splits into two barium, atoms.

288
00:16:25.990 --> 00:16:29.620
He was vague about the actual mechanics, not fully comprehending them himself.

289
00:16:30.400 --> 00:16:31.600
Unfortunately it might not could explain it.

290
00:16:31.601 --> 00:16:35.140
So she did just ask a few weeks after the discovery had been published,

291
00:16:35.141 --> 00:16:38.830
she wrote a letter to the editor of nature and explained how the process had

292
00:16:38.831 --> 00:16:40.240
been successfully achieved.

293
00:16:40.510 --> 00:16:44.320
This was the first place where the term efficient actually appeared.

294
00:16:44.500 --> 00:16:49.060
It only took a few months for word of the discovery to spread by April, 1939,

295
00:16:49.061 --> 00:16:52.780
the German government was pushing it scientists to find a way to weaponize the

296
00:16:52.781 --> 00:16:54.130
discovery ends by August.

297
00:16:54.131 --> 00:16:58.450
Einstein was issuing severe warnings on what would happen if the world figured

298
00:16:58.451 --> 00:17:01.360
out how to do it all the while Han remained in Nazi,

299
00:17:01.361 --> 00:17:03.550
Germany might not continue to work with them.

300
00:17:03.730 --> 00:17:06.130
All beers with drastically changed opinions on him,

301
00:17:06.131 --> 00:17:10.330
alongside the other scientists who remains in Nazi controlled territory in a

302
00:17:10.331 --> 00:17:12.550
lesser, she never sends might not confess this.

303
00:17:12.880 --> 00:17:17.350
I must write this to you because so much depends for both Germany and yourselves

304
00:17:17.351 --> 00:17:19.780
on your recognizing what you allow to happen.

305
00:17:19.870 --> 00:17:23.740
You betrayed Germany itself because even when the war was already quite

306
00:17:23.741 --> 00:17:27.550
hopeless, you did not arm yourself against the senseless destruction.

307
00:17:27.670 --> 00:17:30.850
If you could have seen, feel self. Those who came there from the case.

308
00:17:37.720 --> 00:17:38.553
<v 1>It was the gentleman.</v>

309
00:17:38.950 --> 00:17:40.030
<v 0>Physicist, Verna Heisenberg,</v>

310
00:17:40.060 --> 00:17:43.780
who was put in charge of harnessing the power of nuclear efficient for practical

311
00:17:43.781 --> 00:17:45.250
applications, or in other words,

312
00:17:45.251 --> 00:17:50.070
creating a fish and a weapon he failed where America succeeded giving rise to

313
00:17:50.071 --> 00:17:54.510
one of Lisa is more famous nicknames. The mother of the atom bomb.

314
00:17:54.540 --> 00:17:55.830
She was awarded this epithet,

315
00:17:55.860 --> 00:17:59.550
despite the fact that she had refused to do any work on the Manhattan project,

316
00:17:59.640 --> 00:18:00.690
a nicknamed bothered her.

317
00:18:00.720 --> 00:18:04.740
She was steadfast in her desire to have nothing to do with weaponized fishing.

318
00:18:04.860 --> 00:18:08.340
She spent the rest of the war in Sweden, sticking firmly to our declaration.

319
00:18:08.610 --> 00:18:11.220
I will have nothing to do with a bomb.

320
00:18:11.400 --> 00:18:13.600
It's a long-standing misconception to that.

321
00:18:13.950 --> 00:18:16.920
Minor was directly responsible for the atom bomb. In 1945,

322
00:18:16.921 --> 00:18:21.000
she was honored by the women's press club and had dinner with president Harry S

323
00:18:21.001 --> 00:18:22.690
Truman you're set to her. So all,

324
00:18:22.691 --> 00:18:26.090
let us a lady who got us into all of this as well.

325
00:18:26.090 --> 00:18:30.350
If that made you cringe well, you are not alone minors in target.

326
00:18:30.620 --> 00:18:34.760
It was punctuated by slight spaced on her agenda and her family's Jewish

327
00:18:34.761 --> 00:18:38.510
history. And it wasn't just the Nobel prize committee that did us,

328
00:18:38.630 --> 00:18:41.720
although there's was perhaps the most gross oversight.

329
00:18:41.870 --> 00:18:45.020
It is certainly there's that is most remembered as they have gone back to look

330
00:18:45.021 --> 00:18:47.960
at the circumstances around her emission from Nobel history.

331
00:18:48.050 --> 00:18:52.850
So whatever historian said really happens around minus Nobel prize. No right?

332
00:18:53.210 --> 00:18:55.820
Who or what is to blame it's more complex.

333
00:18:56.240 --> 00:19:00.350
Then it seems at first glance and according to Gustaf call strands curator of

334
00:19:00.351 --> 00:19:01.490
the Nobel museum,

335
00:19:01.760 --> 00:19:05.630
both Han and Mike were nominated for the prize and many consider it to be an

336
00:19:06.170 --> 00:19:07.520
emission that she did not receive it.

337
00:19:07.790 --> 00:19:11.360
Historians who have looked in the archives have determined that the committee

338
00:19:11.361 --> 00:19:16.160
member who evaluated mindness candidacy made a mistake and underestimated her

339
00:19:16.190 --> 00:19:19.400
influence in the discovery. The museum might realize that now,

340
00:19:19.401 --> 00:19:21.770
but there was never any move made by the committee.

341
00:19:21.830 --> 00:19:26.420
You do formally address their oversight, Oh, by most accounts excepted the snob,

342
00:19:26.810 --> 00:19:29.270
but it still had to hut for what it's worth.

343
00:19:29.330 --> 00:19:31.280
There was no grand celebration for Han.

344
00:19:31.460 --> 00:19:34.970
He was in England interns with other German scientists.

345
00:19:34.971 --> 00:19:37.760
When he got words that he had one, it was 1945.

346
00:19:37.880 --> 00:19:40.370
After the bombing of Hiroshima and Nagasaki,

347
00:19:40.371 --> 00:19:43.820
he sank into such a deep despair that he considered suicide.

348
00:19:44.150 --> 00:19:47.390
Instead he hearing sounds Germany accepted a position at the max Planck

349
00:19:47.391 --> 00:19:51.680
Institute and became an active voice in the campaign against nuclear weapons.

350
00:19:51.770 --> 00:19:54.320
As for Meitner. She refused to ever return to Germany.

351
00:19:54.560 --> 00:19:58.400
She briefly became a Swedish citizen before eventually settling in England for

352
00:19:58.401 --> 00:19:59.360
her retirement years.

353
00:19:59.690 --> 00:20:03.560
The role that work plays in the building of the atom bomb seems to horns are

354
00:20:03.770 --> 00:20:07.640
more than the loss of any accolades. Miner never stopped speaking to hon.

355
00:20:07.670 --> 00:20:11.090
They continue to write that as an hon eventually admitted to her that she had

356
00:20:11.091 --> 00:20:14.720
been right about his responsibilities during the war for our 80th birthday in

357
00:20:14.721 --> 00:20:18.920
1958, he wrote to her, we all knew that injustice was taking place,

358
00:20:18.950 --> 00:20:20.510
but we didn't want to see it.

359
00:20:20.720 --> 00:20:24.230
We deceived ourselves come the in 1933,

360
00:20:24.231 --> 00:20:28.430
I followed a flag that should have been torn down immediately. I did not do so.

361
00:20:28.670 --> 00:20:31.700
And now I must bear responsibility for it. Well,

362
00:20:31.701 --> 00:20:33.350
the Nobel prize committee never fixed.

363
00:20:33.351 --> 00:20:37.790
What many consider a grievous oversight minor did receive some recognition for

364
00:20:37.791 --> 00:20:39.620
how walk in 1966,

365
00:20:39.621 --> 00:20:44.210
the U S department of energy awarded her hon and Straussman Enrico Fermi awards

366
00:20:44.211 --> 00:20:48.910
given for pioneering research in the naturally occurring and extensive

367
00:20:48.911 --> 00:20:51.370
experimental studies leading to the discovery efficient.

368
00:20:51.610 --> 00:20:54.160
She was recognized with a slew of other awards and honors too.

369
00:20:54.220 --> 00:20:55.990
She was nominated for a Nobel prize.

370
00:20:55.991 --> 00:21:00.070
Three times was given a number of honorary doctorates and perhaps best of all,

371
00:21:00.250 --> 00:21:05.170
than to name to an asteroid and elements and a series of craters on both Venus

372
00:21:05.290 --> 00:21:07.780
and the moon. Those are all great gestures,

373
00:21:08.020 --> 00:21:11.980
but it could also be argued that they came a few decades too late Meitner turns

374
00:21:11.981 --> 00:21:16.060
89 in 1968 and passed away after a heart attack, a full,

375
00:21:16.270 --> 00:21:18.820
a broken hip and a series of small strokes,

376
00:21:19.030 --> 00:21:21.610
her nephew and longtime collaborator, rotor avatar,

377
00:21:21.611 --> 00:21:26.080
which read Lisa might not a physicist who never lost her humanity.

378
00:21:26.470 --> 00:21:29.080
