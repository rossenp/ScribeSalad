During a happy period of more than four score years,

5
00:00:16.701 --> 00:00:20.780
the public administration was conducted by the virtue and abilities of Nerva

6
00:00:21.050 --> 00:00:22.340
Trajan Hadrian.

7
00:00:22.610 --> 00:00:26.720
And the two Anthony means these are the words of 18th century historian,

8
00:00:26.721 --> 00:00:31.130
Edward Gibbon exemplifying the concept of the five good emperors five Roman

9
00:00:31.131 --> 00:00:35.690
rulers who successfully governs the empire by absolute power under the guidance

10
00:00:35.691 --> 00:00:40.430
of wisdom and virtue Hadrian was there right in the middle and left behind the

11
00:00:40.460 --> 00:00:43.790
legacy of a buildup. As he traveled throughout the regions of his empire,

12
00:00:43.850 --> 00:00:46.700
he founded new cities while all the existing settlements,

13
00:00:46.790 --> 00:00:49.520
he encountered benefited from some kind of improvements,

14
00:00:49.521 --> 00:00:51.650
whether it was a new theater, a bath house,

15
00:00:51.651 --> 00:00:53.750
or even just a donation for the future.

16
00:00:53.810 --> 00:00:58.130
He enacted since more policies and strengthens the position of his army is even

17
00:00:58.131 --> 00:01:00.860
though he had no grounds, military ambitions,

18
00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:03.170
that being said Hadrian was definitely no.

19
00:01:03.590 --> 00:01:05.690
Saint people quickly fell out of his fever runs.

20
00:01:05.900 --> 00:01:10.370
As you will see those who were posed or slighted him matched their violent ends.

21
00:01:10.430 --> 00:01:14.960
He also cattails the powers of the Senate and leans more towards an autocratic

22
00:01:14.961 --> 00:01:18.410
rule. For this reason, scholars see Hadrian as a mercurial character.

23
00:01:18.590 --> 00:01:23.240
One whose outward displays of geniality and restraint could have simply been a

24
00:01:23.241 --> 00:01:26.540
facade, hiding a devious and hedonistic minds,

25
00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:30.620
or maybe he was just an emperor who wanted to help his people as best he could.

26
00:01:31.010 --> 00:01:33.470
It really is hard to say. And for millennia,

27
00:01:33.500 --> 00:01:37.130
Hadrian has been a puzzle that historians have struggled to.

28
00:01:43.790 --> 00:01:43.910
<v 1>[Inaudible].</v>

29
00:01:43.910 --> 00:01:47.810
<v 0>Hadrian was born Cumulus Ellias Hadrianus on January the 24th,</v>

30
00:01:47.811 --> 00:01:51.560
76 a deal. Although his place of birth is still somewhat uncertain.

31
00:01:51.590 --> 00:01:55.820
Although most sources indicate he was born in Italico era settlement in the

32
00:01:55.821 --> 00:01:57.080
province of Spain here,

33
00:01:57.110 --> 00:02:01.340
beta others have said that his family may have actually been in Rome at the time

34
00:02:01.341 --> 00:02:02.030
of his birth,

35
00:02:02.030 --> 00:02:06.140
which would not have been so far fetched given that his father PBLs alias

36
00:02:06.800 --> 00:02:10.310
Adriana's Ava was a Roman Senate up. His mother was named Paulina,

37
00:02:10.370 --> 00:02:12.290
retroactively referred to as Paulina,

38
00:02:12.291 --> 00:02:17.060
the elder to help distinguish us from Hadrian's sister and his niece who both

39
00:02:17.061 --> 00:02:20.570
shared the same name and other relative we should highlight in is perhaps the

40
00:02:20.571 --> 00:02:24.140
most important. One of all was an uncle of Hadrian names. Marcus

41
00:02:25.640 --> 00:02:25.820
[inaudible].

42
00:02:25.820 --> 00:02:30.170
He is better remembered as the Roman emperor Trajan and he will play a major

43
00:02:30.171 --> 00:02:33.260
role in Hadrian's life. His own reign was also quite noticeable,

44
00:02:33.290 --> 00:02:35.780
perhaps the best one of all, then guess what?

45
00:02:35.780 --> 00:02:39.920
We've already done a biographics video all about him. If he missed it,

46
00:02:39.921 --> 00:02:42.230
why not give it to watch right now and then come back here? Well,

47
00:02:42.260 --> 00:02:46.040
we'll pick up pretty much where the last one left off in 86,

48
00:02:46.041 --> 00:02:48.050
80 Hadrian lost both of his parents.

49
00:02:48.051 --> 00:02:50.450
It was a terrible blow for the young 10 year old boy,

50
00:02:50.480 --> 00:02:52.610
but he had a modicum of good fortune.

51
00:02:52.760 --> 00:02:56.400
His Trajan took him and his sister under his wing as his wards.

52
00:02:56.700 --> 00:02:59.360
Ward's downstairs. Another powerful, official named [inaudible],

53
00:02:59.470 --> 00:03:00.640
who was a friend of his father.

54
00:03:00.790 --> 00:03:04.450
This was still over a decade before Trajan took the throne,

55
00:03:04.480 --> 00:03:08.200
but he still had the money and influence to ensure that Hadrian received a good

56
00:03:08.201 --> 00:03:12.160
education and then started climbing through the ranks of Roman bureaucracy.

57
00:03:12.250 --> 00:03:13.270
As it was expected of him.

58
00:03:13.300 --> 00:03:16.930
Hadrian ends of public service on the path to become a Roman Senator like his

59
00:03:16.931 --> 00:03:17.620
father.

60
00:03:17.620 --> 00:03:22.000
He started out as a lowly civil servants and then served several times as a

61
00:03:22.001 --> 00:03:25.360
military Tribune. Not surprisingly when Trajan became the new emperor,

62
00:03:25.540 --> 00:03:28.540
the positions held by Hadrian significantly improved,

63
00:03:28.541 --> 00:03:32.020
but even so Trajan was careful not to promote him too fast.

64
00:03:32.021 --> 00:03:35.950
And there was even a ten-year period when Hadrian did not rise through the ranks

65
00:03:35.951 --> 00:03:40.540
at all, he served among others is Christ a Tribune, pray to a console. And,

66
00:03:41.110 --> 00:03:44.290
but he was also able to indulge his passion for Greek culture.

67
00:03:44.320 --> 00:03:48.220
When he traveled to Athens where he was granted citizenship and named as one of

68
00:03:48.221 --> 00:03:51.370
the arch arms, the officials who handled the city's affairs

69
00:03:57.930 --> 00:04:01.620
With any succession worth mentioning Hadrian's rise to the throne of Rome was

70
00:04:01.621 --> 00:04:05.850
marked by intrigue violence and controversy. At the time of Trajan's death,

71
00:04:05.880 --> 00:04:08.940
Rome was a war with a Parthian empire in Western Asia.

72
00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:11.520
The conflict was not going in his favor.

73
00:04:11.521 --> 00:04:15.570
And he also had to contend with several rebellions and other parts of his empire

74
00:04:15.660 --> 00:04:18.990
in 117 ed Trajan fell ill. So he sat,

75
00:04:18.991 --> 00:04:23.040
sailed back to Rome where Hadrian became the de facto commander leading the

76
00:04:23.041 --> 00:04:26.250
Romans against puffier as the new governor of Syria.

77
00:04:26.310 --> 00:04:27.600
Trajan never made it home though,

78
00:04:27.900 --> 00:04:32.400
as he died on the journey on August the eighth now of course came the matter of

79
00:04:32.550 --> 00:04:36.690
who will become the new emperor Trajan and his wife Pompei up Latina had no

80
00:04:36.691 --> 00:04:41.160
children of their own and he never named a Nat no Diddy because around the time

81
00:04:41.161 --> 00:04:41.761
of his death,

82
00:04:41.761 --> 00:04:46.110
some letters appeared apparently written by Trajan where he named Hadrian as his

83
00:04:46.111 --> 00:04:51.090
adopted son and add to the throne. So did Trajan actually write these letters?

84
00:04:51.390 --> 00:04:54.000
That is the question that still troubles historians.

85
00:04:54.030 --> 00:04:57.090
Many historians believe that Hadrian succession was in fact,

86
00:04:57.091 --> 00:05:02.040
the work of Platina and his other guardian at yanas who both wanted Hadrian to

87
00:05:02.041 --> 00:05:04.530
rule because one, they liked him and two,

88
00:05:04.531 --> 00:05:07.700
because it meant they would maintain their privileged positions by the emperor's

89
00:05:07.701 --> 00:05:10.860
side. And this is not a belief of only modern scholars,

90
00:05:11.010 --> 00:05:13.020
ancient historians like Cassius Dio,

91
00:05:13.030 --> 00:05:17.070
who is one of our main references for Hadrian said the same thing in his room

92
00:05:17.160 --> 00:05:19.350
and history written less than a hundred years later,

93
00:05:19.410 --> 00:05:21.540
even at a great source for his opinion,

94
00:05:21.600 --> 00:05:25.650
his own father [inaudible] who served as Senator and governor of Synthesia.

95
00:05:25.710 --> 00:05:29.700
Cassius DEO claims that his father established with accuracy as did other

96
00:05:29.701 --> 00:05:30.360
senators,

97
00:05:30.360 --> 00:05:34.350
that the succession of Hadrian had been engineered by patina as it was her

98
00:05:34.351 --> 00:05:38.430
signature on the letters allegedly written by Trajan something she had never

99
00:05:38.431 --> 00:05:39.090
done before.

100
00:05:39.090 --> 00:05:42.810
He also sends that Platina delayed the announcement of her husband's death so

101
00:05:42.811 --> 00:05:46.770
that the people most first hear of Hadrian's adoption. Surprisingly,

102
00:05:46.800 --> 00:05:50.310
despite the suspicions Hadrian's Ascension to the throne when smoothly and

103
00:05:50.340 --> 00:05:51.173
unopposed,

104
00:05:51.240 --> 00:05:55.320
some have argued that this was because even if Trajan did not name him as his,

105
00:05:55.790 --> 00:05:58.730
eh, probably it would have been okay with Hadrian becoming the next emperor.

106
00:05:58.790 --> 00:06:02.720
After Royal Trajan took him on as his ward, he looks after his political career,

107
00:06:02.750 --> 00:06:04.550
he arranged for Hadrian to marry.

108
00:06:04.551 --> 00:06:08.450
One of his grand nieces would be as to be an errand. During times of war,

109
00:06:08.480 --> 00:06:12.020
he showed that he trusted Hadrian by placing him in charge of the troops.

110
00:06:12.080 --> 00:06:15.110
Furthermore, if Trajan did have someone else in mind,

111
00:06:15.140 --> 00:06:19.280
he probably would have named him by then the Historia or gusta mentions a rumor

112
00:06:19.310 --> 00:06:22.670
that Trajan intended to name one of Rome's leading jurists,

113
00:06:22.700 --> 00:06:25.010
neuro Ts Prisco's as his successor,

114
00:06:25.220 --> 00:06:28.640
but this is the only source on the matter and is generally considered to be

115
00:06:28.641 --> 00:06:29.474
pretty unreal

116
00:06:36.130 --> 00:06:40.090
On August the 10th, 117 80 Hadrian became the new Roman emperor.

117
00:06:40.120 --> 00:06:43.990
He was still in Syria and he took his time before heading to the Capitol,

118
00:06:43.991 --> 00:06:46.900
putting down some of the rebellions that had erupted during the reign of his

119
00:06:46.901 --> 00:06:49.840
predecessor. He did however, write letters to the Roman Senate.

120
00:06:49.841 --> 00:06:53.560
Some was boilerplate staff asking the Senate to confirm his sovereignty,

121
00:06:53.590 --> 00:06:57.160
choosing an official title for himself, pledging to serve the public interests,

122
00:06:57.170 --> 00:07:01.210
making arrangements for Trajan's funerals and densification and so on.

123
00:07:01.390 --> 00:07:03.520
They also wanted to get on the good side to the Senate.

124
00:07:03.521 --> 00:07:06.430
So he swore an oath never to put to death and he sent it to her.

125
00:07:06.490 --> 00:07:08.890
He then immediately proceeded to break this oath,

126
00:07:08.891 --> 00:07:11.890
or at the very least it was broken in his name.

127
00:07:11.950 --> 00:07:14.110
We're not sure of the precise circumstances,

128
00:07:14.111 --> 00:07:16.240
but soon after Hadrian's essential to the throne,

129
00:07:16.390 --> 00:07:19.810
four of Rome's most powerful senators were accused and convicted of several

130
00:07:19.811 --> 00:07:22.060
challenges, including conspiracy against him.

131
00:07:22.090 --> 00:07:25.660
They were Palmer and the greeners sealers and Kratos,

132
00:07:26.140 --> 00:07:27.580
none were actually in Rome at the time.

133
00:07:27.581 --> 00:07:30.940
So they were convicted in absentia without a public trial and sentenced to

134
00:07:30.941 --> 00:07:33.430
death. And then they were tracked down and killed.

135
00:07:33.460 --> 00:07:36.790
This immediately turns to the Senate against Hadrian within amnesty.

136
00:07:36.791 --> 00:07:39.580
That lasted for his entire reign. Even when he died,

137
00:07:39.610 --> 00:07:43.210
the Senate wanted to deny him the divine honors it's pretty much had to be

138
00:07:43.211 --> 00:07:45.700
forced to do so by a successor for his bond.

139
00:07:45.701 --> 00:07:49.750
Hadrian always denied any involvement in the deaths of the four senators has

140
00:07:49.751 --> 00:07:52.930
guardian and Tatiana's was almost certainly responsible,

141
00:07:52.931 --> 00:07:57.400
but it remains a matter of pure speculation of whether Hadrian Newman's approved

142
00:07:57.401 --> 00:08:01.120
of his actions or not given the power and influence of the four slain officials.

143
00:08:01.300 --> 00:08:03.430
It would not be out of the question for,

144
00:08:03.790 --> 00:08:07.210
at a yarn as to fear that they might oppose Hadrian succession,

145
00:08:07.270 --> 00:08:11.020
but this is just conjecture the Historia or Gusto, which again,

146
00:08:11.021 --> 00:08:14.590
contains a lot of statements that are demonstrably false claims that the four

147
00:08:14.591 --> 00:08:17.260
officials can spot in a murder plot against the new emperor.

148
00:08:17.290 --> 00:08:20.410
These senators were not the only prominent men slain by Hadrian.

149
00:08:20.411 --> 00:08:22.900
If Cassius DEO is anything to go by,

150
00:08:22.930 --> 00:08:26.080
he also accused the emperor of banishing and then putting to death,

151
00:08:26.110 --> 00:08:29.080
Apple adores of Damascus, the theme doc attacked,

152
00:08:29.081 --> 00:08:31.960
who was responsible for most of the landmarks built under Trajan,

153
00:08:31.961 --> 00:08:34.930
including his Trump full column into the bridge, cross the Danube,

154
00:08:35.020 --> 00:08:39.340
all of this because Apollo Duras and sells his Hadrian ones back when Trajan was

155
00:08:39.341 --> 00:08:42.400
still emperor like mocking his plans for a new building.

156
00:08:42.580 --> 00:08:47.020
Now one may start to wonder why exactly Hadrian was considered a good emperor in

157
00:08:47.021 --> 00:08:50.830
the first place, given his propensity to eliminate those who slighted him.

158
00:08:50.950 --> 00:08:54.070
But it was also Cassius DEO who came to his defense,

159
00:08:54.071 --> 00:08:57.360
arguing that all of Hadrian's faults were atoned for,

160
00:08:57.361 --> 00:09:02.250
by his careful oversight, his prudence, his munificence and his skill.

161
00:09:02.280 --> 00:09:06.600
The historian posits that throughout his lengthy 21 year reign Hadrian did not

162
00:09:06.601 --> 00:09:07.470
seek out war,

163
00:09:07.590 --> 00:09:11.730
but terminated the conflicts already in progress restrict and disciplines, man,

164
00:09:11.731 --> 00:09:16.080
he made sure his legions were the same and that they would never be guilty of

165
00:09:16.081 --> 00:09:17.790
insulin sore in subordination.

166
00:09:17.880 --> 00:09:21.990
He never deprived anyone of their wealth without cause, but quite the contrary,

167
00:09:22.050 --> 00:09:26.880

<v 1>[Inaudible].</v>

197
00:11:06.110 --> 00:11:09.290
<v 0>We're given an outline of Hadrian's reign with the good and the bad,</v>

198
00:11:09.291 --> 00:11:11.630
but now let's get into more details here.

199
00:11:11.840 --> 00:11:14.540
I've in Rome in 118 80 for his coronation,

200
00:11:14.720 --> 00:11:18.080
he did the standard staff to get the public on his side. He organized games,

201
00:11:18.081 --> 00:11:21.890
made donations, gave bonuses to soldiers, canceled debts, et cetera.

202
00:11:22.130 --> 00:11:26.390
He also quote unquote suggested to ask the owners to give up his position as

203
00:11:26.391 --> 00:11:30.050
Praetorian prefect and go into retirement in 119,

204
00:11:30.170 --> 00:11:33.050
whether this was done as a gesture of Goodwill towards the Senate,

205
00:11:33.051 --> 00:11:36.800
or because Hadrian genuinely had no involvement in the deaths of the four

206
00:11:36.801 --> 00:11:37.520
senators.

207
00:11:37.520 --> 00:11:41.330
We don't know that [inaudible] was replaced with two other men except to see as

208
00:11:41.331 --> 00:11:43.790
Claris and Macias turbo.

209
00:11:43.970 --> 00:11:47.090
One of Hadrian's first major acts as emperor was a ballsy one.

210
00:11:47.120 --> 00:11:50.720
He reversed Trajan's policies in Western Asia and willingly surrendered.

211
00:11:50.721 --> 00:11:53.890
The territories his predecessor had gained in Mesopotamia.

212
00:11:54.010 --> 00:11:56.350
It wasn't a glorious move, but it was practical.

213
00:11:56.500 --> 00:11:59.770
Hadrian understood that Rome might've been powerful enough to conquer the

214
00:11:59.771 --> 00:12:00.221
region,

215
00:12:00.221 --> 00:12:04.390
but did not have the soldiers and resources to keep it and maintain peace.

216
00:12:04.450 --> 00:12:07.690
If he insisted on continuing Trajan's expansionist approach,

217
00:12:07.720 --> 00:12:10.450
he would have had to deal with one rebellion after another. Instead,

218
00:12:10.451 --> 00:12:14.110
what Hadrian liked was to use natural borders to consolidate the embar he

219
00:12:14.111 --> 00:12:14.801
already had.

220
00:12:14.801 --> 00:12:18.520
So he gave up room's claim to everything East of the affinities river.

221
00:12:18.730 --> 00:12:21.640
This remains the Roman approach for the following for decades.

222
00:12:21.850 --> 00:12:24.370
And so Rome wins a war against Patheos once again,

223
00:12:24.640 --> 00:12:29.530
in 161 ID inside the empire Hadrian was enacting multiple reforms to benefit the

224
00:12:29.531 --> 00:12:33.310
people of Rome, some which went against long established Roman traditions.

225
00:12:33.430 --> 00:12:36.250
For example, when someone was charged with the major crime,

226
00:12:36.251 --> 00:12:39.610
it was common to confiscate their estate. According to the new law,

227
00:12:39.640 --> 00:12:40.870
if that person had children,

228
00:12:40.900 --> 00:12:43.630
they were allowed to inherit a portion of their wealth Hadrian,

229
00:12:43.631 --> 00:12:46.660
also reclassified middle class officials, soldiers, veterans,

230
00:12:46.661 --> 00:12:49.180
and their families is on a [inaudible].

231
00:12:49.210 --> 00:12:53.500
This is one of two categories of Roman citizens representing the high cost,

232
00:12:53.501 --> 00:12:55.540
as opposed to humiliate berries,

233
00:12:55.541 --> 00:12:58.840
which was the low-cost consisting of freed men and slaves.

234
00:12:58.990 --> 00:13:02.140
The distinction was important because the higher-cost benefited from multiple

235
00:13:02.141 --> 00:13:04.780
legal privileges, particularly when it came to criminal law,

236
00:13:04.960 --> 00:13:08.980
they almost always received more lenient sentences while the cruelest punishment

237
00:13:08.981 --> 00:13:13.180
such as being crucified or thrown to the beasts in the arena were reserved only

238
00:13:13.181 --> 00:13:14.200
for the lower cost.

239
00:13:14.320 --> 00:13:17.470
So while the wealthy enjoyed preferential treatment in most societies,

240
00:13:17.471 --> 00:13:20.920
it was actually part of Roman law that they were granted these privileges.

241
00:13:21.010 --> 00:13:24.850
And although Hadrian did not get rid of such concessions C at least made them

242
00:13:24.851 --> 00:13:27.610
available to more groups of people. Some of the emperor's policies,

243
00:13:27.611 --> 00:13:30.940
even benefited slaves as they limited the punishments that could be inflicted

244
00:13:30.941 --> 00:13:31.540
upon them.

245
00:13:31.540 --> 00:13:34.990
Hadrian made it illegal for citizens to kill their slaves just because they felt

246
00:13:34.991 --> 00:13:36.640
like it. They could only do it.

247
00:13:36.641 --> 00:13:39.010
If the slaves were found guilty of a capital offense,

248
00:13:39.180 --> 00:13:42.100
when the slaves could not be sold to gladiator schools or brothels.

249
00:13:42.190 --> 00:13:45.910
And unless again, it was punishment for a crime. They committed granted.

250
00:13:45.940 --> 00:13:47.440
It's still not much in hindsight,

251
00:13:47.470 --> 00:13:52.060
but it's more than most other emperors ever did to benefit the lowest class of

252
00:13:52.240 --> 00:13:53.073
people in Rome.

253
00:13:59.680 --> 00:14:00.270
<v 3>[Inaudible].</v>

254
00:14:00.270 --> 00:14:04.230
<v 0>Rain was characterized by one thing more so than anything else travel.</v>

255
00:14:04.500 --> 00:14:07.740
He traveled throughout his empire more than all the previous emperors going from

256
00:14:07.741 --> 00:14:10.650
region to region preferring to see things for himself,

257
00:14:10.651 --> 00:14:12.570
rather than relying on reports from others.

258
00:14:12.630 --> 00:14:16.800
Other rulers usually upstage and Romans only left when it was time for war

259
00:14:16.890 --> 00:14:20.130
Hadrian. On the other hand spent over half his rain outside Rome,

260
00:14:20.131 --> 00:14:22.920
founding new cities and improving the ones that already existed.

261
00:14:23.040 --> 00:14:26.490
He also gave plenty of attention to his military fortifications in order to

262
00:14:26.491 --> 00:14:30.210
better protect his empire from external and internal threats.

263
00:14:30.390 --> 00:14:34.170
You ordered the construction of new forts and garrisons had others moved to more

264
00:14:34.171 --> 00:14:35.340
favorable positions.

265
00:14:35.341 --> 00:14:40.170
And some had demolished Hadrian embarked on this tour of Zen power and 122

266
00:14:40.350 --> 00:14:44.220
80 deep. His first stop was Britannia AKA the politic of great Britain,

267
00:14:44.250 --> 00:14:45.720
which was a Roman province.

268
00:14:46.080 --> 00:14:50.100
He ordered the construction of arguably the most famous structure that bears his

269
00:14:50.101 --> 00:14:51.680
name. Hadrian's wall,

270
00:14:51.681 --> 00:14:56.030
a 73 mile defensive fortification that traveled from the East to the West of the

271
00:14:56.031 --> 00:14:57.490
province when it was finished at,

272
00:14:57.491 --> 00:15:01.360
at 80 small forts called Mark castle plus 17 larger faults,

273
00:15:01.361 --> 00:15:04.690
which we used to Garrison exhilarate soldiers from all over the end pop.

274
00:15:04.700 --> 00:15:08.260
Initially it was abandoned right after Hadrian's death because the success of

275
00:15:08.550 --> 00:15:11.500
wanted to build his own wall further up North into Scotland. However,

276
00:15:11.560 --> 00:15:15.370
that second wall was subsequently also abandoned as the following emperor is

277
00:15:15.371 --> 00:15:19.600
preferred to rely on hatred, which from that point on remained in use yeah,

278
00:15:19.660 --> 00:15:24.370
over 300 years and large parts of the wall still do stand to this day

279
00:15:24.520 --> 00:15:28.630
after Britannia Hadrian returned to mainland Europe and traveled through parts

280
00:15:28.631 --> 00:15:32.050
of what is today, France and Spain, before sailing for North Africa,

281
00:15:32.320 --> 00:15:34.120
all the trips themselves were not problematic.

282
00:15:34.121 --> 00:15:36.340
The emperor had to deal with a few issues in Rome.

283
00:15:36.490 --> 00:15:40.180
Pompa Platina the widow of Trajan and his former guardian had died.

284
00:15:40.181 --> 00:15:44.710
So Hadrian made arrangements to have a day of, I built a temple in ironic.

285
00:15:44.770 --> 00:15:45.280
Furthermore,

286
00:15:45.280 --> 00:15:48.610
the emperor dismissed two of his close confidants from his inner circle for

287
00:15:48.880 --> 00:15:52.690
allegedly behaving with great familiarity towards his wife's Bina.

288
00:15:52.750 --> 00:15:53.490
They were septic.

289
00:15:53.490 --> 00:15:57.880
He as Clarus one of the two Praetorian prefects and the historians Tonia is who

290
00:15:58.060 --> 00:16:02.860
held the position of AB EPIs stewardess or the minister of letters who handled

291
00:16:02.861 --> 00:16:04.240
the Imperial correspondence.

292
00:16:04.270 --> 00:16:07.870
What happened to them after this point remains uncertain upon arriving in

293
00:16:07.871 --> 00:16:11.500
Africa, Hadrian had to put down a rebellion by the Morse afterwards.

294
00:16:11.501 --> 00:16:14.410
He cut his trip short when word reached him that Patheon,

295
00:16:14.440 --> 00:16:15.970
might've been preparing for war again.

296
00:16:16.090 --> 00:16:20.170
He hurried to Asia where he made sure that Roman defenses were up to snuff and

297
00:16:20.320 --> 00:16:24.940
after discussions with the Patheon King Austra is the first ensured that there

298
00:16:24.941 --> 00:16:26.680
would be peace between their embars,

299
00:16:26.690 --> 00:16:28.900
at least for the time being while he was there,

300
00:16:28.960 --> 00:16:31.360
Hadrian visited the Roman provinces in Asia minor.

301
00:16:31.390 --> 00:16:35.170
And that is where he met Antinous by Sydney and youth that the Ambra fell in

302
00:16:35.171 --> 00:16:35.740
love with.

303
00:16:35.740 --> 00:16:39.580
He quickly became a favorite of Hadrian who first sent him to Rome to complete

304
00:16:39.581 --> 00:16:42.670
his education. Then afterwards made him a part of his retinue.

305
00:16:42.850 --> 00:16:45.280
His love has continued that journey throughout the empire.

306
00:16:45.340 --> 00:16:49.960
The last stop before Hadrian finally returned to Rome in 126 D was Greece.

307
00:16:49.990 --> 00:16:53.980
One of, if not his favorite place in the world, he spent almost a year there,

308
00:16:53.981 --> 00:16:57.280
mostly in Athens taking part in their games and rituals, funding,

309
00:16:57.310 --> 00:16:58.660
public works and festivals,

310
00:16:58.750 --> 00:17:01.210
and even getting initiated in the Ellis Indian mysteries.

311
00:17:01.211 --> 00:17:04.120
One of the most secretive religious rights of ancient Greece today,

312
00:17:04.121 --> 00:17:08.260
there are still plenty of remnants left to remind the world of Hadrian's voyage.

313
00:17:08.290 --> 00:17:10.120
There is an art of Hadrian in Athens.

314
00:17:10.121 --> 00:17:14.110
There is an even more impressive one in Jordan there's Hadrian's gate in Turkey,

315
00:17:14.170 --> 00:17:17.950
not to mention that he dedicated resources to finish or rebuild older structures

316
00:17:17.951 --> 00:17:21.940
like the Roman Pantheon and the temple of Zeus in Athens after a couple of

317
00:17:21.941 --> 00:17:22.840
years, spends in Rome,

318
00:17:23.320 --> 00:17:26.620
Hadrian got restless again and sat out on another tour at 128.

319
00:17:26.770 --> 00:17:29.650
This time starting with Greece, he then set off at Egypt.

320
00:17:29.651 --> 00:17:33.250
Since you have to count his time in Africa short during his first voyage here,

321
00:17:33.280 --> 00:17:36.880
tragedy befell the emperor in September or October, 130,

322
00:17:36.881 --> 00:17:40.360
his lover Anthony has died apparently by falling and drowning in the river Nile.

323
00:17:40.390 --> 00:17:43.450
There were whispers that he may have been murdered as part of a conspiracy

324
00:17:43.451 --> 00:17:47.200
against Hadrian while Cassius Dio claims the young man sacrificed himself

325
00:17:47.230 --> 00:17:50.490
willingly so that the gods may cure Hadrian of an unknown illness.

326
00:17:50.520 --> 00:17:53.970
Whatever happens. The emperor was distraught over the death of the young man.

327
00:17:53.971 --> 00:17:56.460
There's only him. He founded a new city on the riverbank way,

328
00:17:56.490 --> 00:17:58.380
perished and named it Antonopoulos.

329
00:17:58.620 --> 00:18:01.890
Even more Hadrian had his love of deified and declared a God,

330
00:18:01.980 --> 00:18:04.140
a cult of worship developed around the man.

331
00:18:04.141 --> 00:18:07.950
And although the emperor obviously encouraged and supported it spread throughout

332
00:18:07.951 --> 00:18:11.400
the empire, even he probably did not expect it to become as big as it did.

333
00:18:11.580 --> 00:18:15.840
The cult lasted for over 200 years after Trajan had died with over two dozen

334
00:18:15.841 --> 00:18:20.040
temples dedicated to worship being built throughout the empire and thousands of

335
00:18:20.670 --> 00:18:22.110
statues being made, bearing his likeness.

336
00:18:28.850 --> 00:18:28.880
<v 1>[Inaudible].</v>

337
00:18:28.880 --> 00:18:32.630
<v 0>Well to enjoy a lengthly rule, mostly devoid of serious military conflicts,</v>

338
00:18:32.631 --> 00:18:35.720
but there is a giant exception and 132 80,

339
00:18:35.721 --> 00:18:40.310
the Roman empire Forter abelian in Judea golds, the bar Barbara volts,

340
00:18:40.340 --> 00:18:42.590
which dominated the last part of Hadrian's reign.

341
00:18:42.620 --> 00:18:45.200
Tensions had been highly in that region for decades.

342
00:18:45.201 --> 00:18:48.950
And this conflict is considered part of the larger Jewish Roman Wars,

343
00:18:48.951 --> 00:18:52.340
which went on for 70 years as to what factors triggered this particular

344
00:18:52.341 --> 00:18:52.940
uprising.

345
00:18:52.940 --> 00:18:56.900
The most discernible motive seemed to be the construction of a new Roman city

346
00:18:56.930 --> 00:19:00.200
called Eylea capita Lena, over the ruins of Jerusalem,

347
00:19:00.201 --> 00:19:04.010
which included a temple dedicated to Jupiter built on temple mounts,

348
00:19:04.020 --> 00:19:05.990
which was a Holy site for the Jewish people.

349
00:19:06.020 --> 00:19:10.730
The rebellion was led by Simon bark. Hakuba hence the name of the revolts.

350
00:19:10.760 --> 00:19:12.410
He wasn't just the military leader,

351
00:19:12.440 --> 00:19:16.340
but he came to regard himself as a messianic figure who may have had up to

352
00:19:16.341 --> 00:19:19.820
400,000 soldiers following him during the uprising. First,

353
00:19:19.821 --> 00:19:24.110
the Romans did not expect that rebellion to grow as fast or be as ferocious as

354
00:19:24.111 --> 00:19:27.380
it turned out to be. They were completely overwhelmed. And soon enough,

355
00:19:27.381 --> 00:19:28.760
the rebels controlled the region.

356
00:19:28.880 --> 00:19:33.260
This area in Judea basically became independent for over two years with rebels,

357
00:19:33.290 --> 00:19:34.970
even striking their own currency.

358
00:19:35.090 --> 00:19:38.510
Eventually though Hadrian called in one of his most accomplished generals,

359
00:19:38.540 --> 00:19:42.590
sexist Julius Severus as well as reinforcements from other provinces.

360
00:19:42.620 --> 00:19:46.030
The Romans started winning battles and forcing the Jewish rebels to withdraw or

361
00:19:46.040 --> 00:19:50.210
until they had to fall back inside the ancient forty-five tower of the top.

362
00:19:50.420 --> 00:19:54.110
What followed was a long siege, but Batar also fell eventually.

363
00:19:54.111 --> 00:19:57.920
And Simon bark Hakuba died during that battle in 135.

364
00:19:57.921 --> 00:20:00.890
A although his numbers can only serve as a rough estimate.

365
00:20:01.040 --> 00:20:04.910
Cassius Dio claimed that over a thousand villages and outposts were raised

366
00:20:04.911 --> 00:20:08.930
during the rebellion and roughly 580,000 men were killed in the fights.

367
00:20:08.960 --> 00:20:13.040
Plus countless more perished of feminine disease or were sold as slaves.

368
00:20:18.350 --> 00:20:19.183
<v 1>[Inaudible].</v>

369
00:20:19.250 --> 00:20:20.420
<v 0>Junior attends, aroma rounds,</v>

370
00:20:20.421 --> 00:20:25.250
134 Ady and never really strayed far outside its limits for the remainder of his

371
00:20:25.251 --> 00:20:27.950
life. If the Historia or Augusta is to be believed,

372
00:20:27.951 --> 00:20:31.550
he became more paranoid and violence. In his later years, putting to death,

373
00:20:31.551 --> 00:20:34.820
influential men who he thought might be conspiring against him.

374
00:20:34.940 --> 00:20:37.660
According to rumors, the emperor even poisoned his own wives,

375
00:20:37.661 --> 00:20:39.770
Sabina who died in 136,

376
00:20:39.771 --> 00:20:43.190
eight deep as Hadrian was getting older and began suffering from various

377
00:20:43.191 --> 00:20:46.620
ailments. I have to consider his success up like Trajan beforehand.

378
00:20:46.670 --> 00:20:47.950
He had no of his own.

379
00:20:47.951 --> 00:20:51.130
So he would have to adopt someone and designate him as his app.

380
00:20:51.220 --> 00:20:53.650
The first name that was thrown around was servi honors.

381
00:20:53.651 --> 00:20:55.900
One of Hadrian's longest serving advisors.

382
00:20:56.110 --> 00:20:58.540
He had been treated for years as the unofficial success.

383
00:20:58.541 --> 00:21:00.880
I bet he was too elderly to become emperor.

384
00:21:00.940 --> 00:21:04.000
He was fine two years old when he died in 136 Ady.

385
00:21:04.000 --> 00:21:07.120
So instead the emperor thought about naming Sovi honest,

386
00:21:07.121 --> 00:21:09.730
his grandson [inaudible] zap. However,

387
00:21:09.790 --> 00:21:13.360
Hadrian soon changed his mind and went with a different man named Lucius

388
00:21:13.990 --> 00:21:17.110
comedies. Not only that, but he has 70 honors and fosters put to death,

389
00:21:17.111 --> 00:21:19.960
allegedly because they were displeased at his action.

390
00:21:20.050 --> 00:21:22.570
What exactly this is supposed to mean? We're not sure.

391
00:21:22.600 --> 00:21:26.560
Did they simply complain about the emperor or is this a nice way of saying that

392
00:21:26.650 --> 00:21:30.280
they tried to stage a coup either way before being executed? So the honest,

393
00:21:30.340 --> 00:21:33.520
allegedly got on his knees and said, as for Hadrian,

394
00:21:33.610 --> 00:21:37.690
this is my only prayer that he may long for death, but be unable to die.

395
00:21:37.780 --> 00:21:40.780
This became incredibly prophetic as Hadrian did indeed die,

396
00:21:40.810 --> 00:21:45.100
a slow painful death and was prevented from committing suicide. Several times,

397
00:21:45.280 --> 00:21:48.550
as far as the Zara was concerned, he adopted the name Lucius alias,

398
00:21:48.580 --> 00:21:51.670
but this turned out to be a poor choice. His successor.

399
00:21:51.880 --> 00:21:55.510
It was actually the son-in-law of Nigrini was one of the four senators killed at

400
00:21:55.511 --> 00:21:57.550
the start of Hadrian's reign because of the, some,

401
00:21:57.730 --> 00:22:01.330
see the choice from Hadrian as atonement for their death, suggesting that,

402
00:22:01.510 --> 00:22:05.770
you know, I've been involved after all regardless, Lucius alias died in 138,

403
00:22:05.771 --> 00:22:09.730
a D a few months before Hadrian. So the Umbra had to select another app.

404
00:22:09.760 --> 00:22:11.950
This time he went with Antonius Pius,

405
00:22:11.951 --> 00:22:16.810
who did indeed succeed him as Roman emperor Hadrian finally perished on July the

406
00:22:16.811 --> 00:22:21.550
10th, 138 AED age 62. So I really hope you found that video. Interesting.
