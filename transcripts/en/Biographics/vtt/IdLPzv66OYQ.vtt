<v 0>This video is brought to you by Blinkus the first 100 people to go to</v>

2
00:00:06.160 --> 00:00:08.200
blink.com/biographics are gonna get tried out for a week.

3
00:00:08.350 --> 00:00:11.520
Also you'll get 25% off if you want the full membership,

4
00:00:11.521 --> 00:00:15.080
which you probably will. Cause it's pretty great, more on them in a bit,

5
00:00:15.140 --> 00:00:16.160
and let's get into it

6
00:00:22.730 --> 00:00:24.590
All good things must come to an end.

7
00:00:24.610 --> 00:00:28.310
And so did the Pacman a 200 year long period of time,

8
00:00:28.311 --> 00:00:33.150
which represented the Roman empire at its most glorious and

9
00:00:33.151 --> 00:00:33.984
most powerful.

10
00:00:34.330 --> 00:00:38.110
It started with the formation of the empire under Augustas and ended with the

11
00:00:38.111 --> 00:00:39.590
death of Marcus sores.

12
00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:43.180
The last of so called five good Empress,

13
00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:45.820
Mar aureus earns the so Bria,

14
00:00:46.080 --> 00:00:50.940
the philosopher king because he personified the concept devised by Plato of

15
00:00:50.980 --> 00:00:55.820
a ruler who was a lover of wisdom and who applied the ideas he learned in

16
00:00:55.821 --> 00:00:59.340
his exercise of power. Margo Aures was stoic,

17
00:00:59.341 --> 00:01:03.490
who believed that reason and virtue led to EU amonia or

18
00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:05.490
blessedness. Despite this,

19
00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:09.410
his reign as emperor was far from enlightened or peaceful during Israel,

20
00:01:09.480 --> 00:01:11.610
Rome had to contend with two major wars,

21
00:01:11.611 --> 00:01:15.450
a rebellion and the plagues that ravaged his em empire and in today's video.

22
00:01:15.760 --> 00:01:16.890
Well, it's all about him.

23
00:01:23.180 --> 00:01:25.680
Marcus aureus was born on April the 26th,

24
00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:30.760
one hundred and twenty one eighty to Marcus Aus Veris III and Deia Luci.

25
00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:34.120
His name of birth may have been Marcus Aus. Veris just like his father,

26
00:01:34.150 --> 00:01:35.800
grandfather and great-grandfather,

27
00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:40.040
but to avoid confusion will just call him Marcus aureus from the start.

28
00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:42.400
His family were wealthy and relatively influe,

29
00:01:42.620 --> 00:01:46.830
according to Cassius D one of our main sources for the reign of Marcus Aures,

30
00:01:46.970 --> 00:01:50.510
his family was somehow related to Emper Hadrian Aures.

31
00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:53.630
His father was a politician. Who'd held the office of prey tour,

32
00:01:53.690 --> 00:01:56.510
but he died young when Marcus was just a child.

33
00:01:56.840 --> 00:01:58.630
We're not sure on the exact date,

34
00:01:58.810 --> 00:02:02.990
but it would've been around 124 ad while he was still in off

35
00:02:03.470 --> 00:02:07.740
later. Marcus OS wrote that while he did not remember much of his father,

36
00:02:07.930 --> 00:02:11.500
from what little memory he had of him, plus what other people have said.

37
00:02:11.800 --> 00:02:16.540
He characterized his father by modesty and Manliness traits that

38
00:02:16.640 --> 00:02:19.300
he sought to emulate. As far as his mother was concerned,

39
00:02:19.500 --> 00:02:22.860
or res said that from her, he learns religious party.

40
00:02:24.310 --> 00:02:28.290
Not only refraining from wrongdoing, this even from thoughts of it,

41
00:02:28.460 --> 00:02:32.530
simplicity in diet and to be far removed from the ways of the rich,

42
00:02:32.740 --> 00:02:35.690
after his father's death, Marcus aureus and his sister,

43
00:02:36.090 --> 00:02:40.290
a corn fi fina were adopted by their paternal grandfather,

44
00:02:40.350 --> 00:02:41.690
Marcus Ave,

45
00:02:41.920 --> 00:02:45.680
thei who had been made trician during the reign of ion.

46
00:02:45.820 --> 00:02:49.920
His father had been a pre and his grandfather served three times as console.

47
00:02:50.180 --> 00:02:54.920
So naturally it was expected for Marcus Aras to follow in their footsteps in

48
00:02:54.921 --> 00:02:57.920
127, a D when he was just six years old,

49
00:02:58.100 --> 00:03:02.880
he was enrolled in the equestrian order by nomination of emperor had himself.

50
00:03:03.010 --> 00:03:03.820
Other than that,

51
00:03:03.820 --> 00:03:07.120
we don't have much information about the early years of the future emperor.

52
00:03:07.290 --> 00:03:09.400
Apart from the names of some of his teachers,

53
00:03:09.430 --> 00:03:13.400
such as DNIS and Alexandra of Koum later,

54
00:03:13.540 --> 00:03:16.120
he was tutored by Alon of Chelsea Dawn,

55
00:03:16.121 --> 00:03:20.710
the man who introduced him to stoicism the philosophy that deeply influenced all

56
00:03:20.711 --> 00:03:21.830
aspects of his life.

57
00:03:22.050 --> 00:03:25.150
The story of Marcus Aurelius has rise to power is a bit convoluted,

58
00:03:25.210 --> 00:03:28.590
but I think we can get there. He was born during the reign of had,

59
00:03:29.110 --> 00:03:33.750
who had no children of his own. Therefore, when the emperor fell ill in 136 ad,

60
00:03:33.890 --> 00:03:38.270
he thought it would be a good idea to appointer. Now he adopted Lucius CS,

61
00:03:38.550 --> 00:03:43.220
commod who was Ember in waiting, took the name, Lucius alias. However,

62
00:03:43.450 --> 00:03:45.620
this turned out to be an ill elevated choice.

63
00:03:45.900 --> 00:03:48.620
As alias died at the start of 138,

64
00:03:48.740 --> 00:03:53.660
a deep next up had adopted Antonius Pariss HISA who became Ember later

65
00:03:53.661 --> 00:03:57.540
that same year after had died on July the 10th as it happens.

66
00:03:58.380 --> 00:04:00.970
Antonios was also Marcus reus as uncle Les.

67
00:04:01.110 --> 00:04:05.890
He married fina his father's sister Adrian's adoption of Antonios came with a

68
00:04:05.891 --> 00:04:10.690
few conditions turn Antonios had to adopt the surviving son of his predecessor a

69
00:04:10.691 --> 00:04:15.330
seven year old boy, also named Lucius CS Commodus as well as his own nephew,

70
00:04:15.770 --> 00:04:19.850
Marcus aureus, all of a sudden a reus was the eldest son of the emperor,

71
00:04:20.040 --> 00:04:22.480
which meant that he was next in line for the throne.

72
00:04:22.710 --> 00:04:26.840
Some historians have speculated that this had been Adrian's intentional along.

73
00:04:27.080 --> 00:04:31.800
Although why the emperor granted so much favor to aureus were not really sure.

74
00:04:31.900 --> 00:04:32.733
Anyway,

75
00:04:32.960 --> 00:04:36.800
Antonios was now the new Roman emperor and to strengthen the bond with his newly

76
00:04:36.801 --> 00:04:41.550
adopted son. He also had Marcus aureus, Mary, his born daughter,

77
00:04:42.270 --> 00:04:45.750
fina the younger, the two of them would go on to have 13 children together.

78
00:04:45.810 --> 00:04:49.870
Unsurprisingly Marcus Aurelius's position, as he apparent, brought with it,

79
00:04:50.070 --> 00:04:53.630
a lot of new promotions. He was first made console in hundred and 40.

80
00:04:53.770 --> 00:04:58.070
He also became the head of the equestrian order, a joins the college of priests.

81
00:04:58.071 --> 00:05:02.540
He took up residents in the Imperial palace and was made stir to learn about the

82
00:05:02.541 --> 00:05:06.140
paperwork and or that we needed to rule Rome. The I office,

83
00:05:06.400 --> 00:05:11.340
he reached while Antonius was still Emper was Pretorian fact at one point,

84
00:05:11.341 --> 00:05:15.380
he also changed his name to Marcus alias or reus VE Caesar,

85
00:05:15.760 --> 00:05:19.940
but we will keep referring to him simply as Marcus, a res for simplicity sake.

86
00:05:19.940 --> 00:05:24.850
Meanwhile, his adopted brother to on the name Luve and followed a similar path,

87
00:05:24.851 --> 00:05:28.850
serving both as quest and consult one notable difference between them was their

88
00:05:29.010 --> 00:05:33.770
physical pro S Marcus sores was frail Embodi as Cassius D put it while

89
00:05:34.410 --> 00:05:36.410
Veis was a vigorous man of young years,

90
00:05:36.510 --> 00:05:38.850
who was proficient in hunting and wrestling,

91
00:05:38.851 --> 00:05:42.840
but took pleasure in all athletic pursuits around our hundred and 60,

92
00:05:42.841 --> 00:05:46.040
80 Antonius fell ill. He died the following year.

93
00:05:46.520 --> 00:05:48.480
Rich's ancestral home in L mending.

94
00:05:48.510 --> 00:05:51.800
What was then the second longest reign of the Roman empire.

95
00:05:51.801 --> 00:05:54.120
After that of Augustus, a few days later,

96
00:05:54.300 --> 00:05:57.360
he was deified at the request of his sons in his book,

97
00:05:57.361 --> 00:06:01.720
Marcus or reus spoke very fondly of his adoptive father saying that no other man

98
00:06:01.780 --> 00:06:06.560
had more influence on him. As a youth. The king is dead long. Live the king.

99
00:06:06.580 --> 00:06:11.560
As the expression goes an was gone and Rome needed a new emperor.

100
00:06:11.620 --> 00:06:14.920
The Senate was ready to confirm Marcus or reus as the new sovereign,

101
00:06:14.980 --> 00:06:19.710
but something curious bar reus refused to take office unless his

102
00:06:19.711 --> 00:06:24.430
younger brother Luci VE was made emperor alongside him. It was unusual,

103
00:06:24.610 --> 00:06:28.150
but the Senate accepted in March the eighth, the hundred and 61 80 March.

104
00:06:28.210 --> 00:06:31.430
The first time that the Roman empire was ruled by two men,

105
00:06:31.540 --> 00:06:36.230
that being said it was never in question who the true leader of Rome was besides

106
00:06:36.250 --> 00:06:38.700
the VAs that mark Marcus aureus was the chosen air.

107
00:06:39.020 --> 00:06:43.340
He was also the older sibling. He had experience helping Anis run the empire.

108
00:06:43.480 --> 00:06:48.020
And he was the only one with the title of PX Maximus there obey Marcus

109
00:06:48.480 --> 00:06:51.580
as a left tenant. AEY a ProCon.

110
00:06:52.120 --> 00:06:56.500
Now you might think that this is a set for some sort of conspiracy or betrayal,

111
00:06:56.740 --> 00:06:59.130
or even an, a assassination down the line.

112
00:06:59.131 --> 00:07:02.690
That's usually how these situations unfolded in ancient times,

113
00:07:02.870 --> 00:07:06.810
but we have here a rare exception despite their different personalities.

114
00:07:06.990 --> 00:07:11.730
The brothers stayed on good terms for the extent of their joint rule and never

115
00:07:11.950 --> 00:07:13.690
did one of them try to use up the other.

116
00:07:19.980 --> 00:07:21.880
You might think that the rule of a calm,

117
00:07:21.881 --> 00:07:26.360
practical and amiable man would mark a time of peace for the Roman empire,

118
00:07:26.420 --> 00:07:30.560
but that would not be in fact for almost his entire 19 year reign Marcus or

119
00:07:30.720 --> 00:07:34.880
really a Swiss involved in one conflict or another first up was the Pathan

120
00:07:34.881 --> 00:07:38.910
empire mighty middle Eastern fact that had been around since the third century

121
00:07:39.330 --> 00:07:42.510
BC. This was not the first time that these two powers clashed.

122
00:07:42.730 --> 00:07:46.070
It seemed that every time the IANS wanted to expand west,

123
00:07:46.340 --> 00:07:49.230
they eventually ran into the dominion of Rome.

124
00:07:49.340 --> 00:07:52.950
This usually took the form of the kingdom of Armenia lands.

125
00:07:52.951 --> 00:07:53.990
That acted as above a,

126
00:07:53.991 --> 00:07:58.910
between the two empires who both wanted to installed an Armenian king who served

127
00:07:59.110 --> 00:08:00.260
their best interests.

128
00:08:00.400 --> 00:08:03.580
The last time this happened was during the rule of tra who we already covered

129
00:08:03.581 --> 00:08:06.580
here on biographics. If you need a quick refresher on him,

130
00:08:06.640 --> 00:08:09.260
why not check out the video that we'll link to below.

131
00:08:09.440 --> 00:08:13.220
Now that happens almost 50 years before Marcus aureus became emperor.

132
00:08:13.460 --> 00:08:14.340
And in the ends,

133
00:08:14.370 --> 00:08:19.020
Armenia became a client state of Rome with its king firmly under Roman control.

134
00:08:19.500 --> 00:08:20.850
It's seems that every few decades,

135
00:08:21.290 --> 00:08:26.130
the new par and king gets the same idea to remove Armenia from under Roman

136
00:08:26.131 --> 00:08:29.570
influence and place it under par influence. In this case,

137
00:08:29.830 --> 00:08:33.450
it was king Volgas as the fourth in a hundred and sixty one eighty,

138
00:08:33.550 --> 00:08:35.530
he marched into Armenia and deposed.

139
00:08:35.670 --> 00:08:39.690
King's Sam mayors replacing him with his own son. PAs,

140
00:08:40.320 --> 00:08:42.520
the Romans were clearly taken by surprise by this move.

141
00:08:42.521 --> 00:08:44.840
And their initial reply was disastrous.

142
00:08:44.970 --> 00:08:49.560
There were two Roman provinces that bordered the kingdom of Armenia Kaia and

143
00:08:49.561 --> 00:08:50.140
Syria,

144
00:08:50.140 --> 00:08:55.000
Marcus SED sever the governor of Kaia decided

145
00:08:55.220 --> 00:08:56.840
to take matters into his own hands,

146
00:08:56.950 --> 00:09:00.480
even though he was not supposed to act without instructions from the Ember app,

147
00:09:00.510 --> 00:09:04.520
allegedly an Oracle convinced him that he would overthrow the Pathan.

148
00:09:04.580 --> 00:09:07.400
So he took Allegion and marched into Armenia.

149
00:09:07.580 --> 00:09:12.360
He reached GUI where his entire army was surrounded and massacre as first

150
00:09:12.880 --> 00:09:16.350
Seran himself. He was either killed him with his soldiers or committed suicide.

151
00:09:16.351 --> 00:09:20.150
Once he realized how badly he had been defeated, seizing the upper hands,

152
00:09:20.250 --> 00:09:24.310
the IANS then invaded Syria and bested the Romans there as well.

153
00:09:24.450 --> 00:09:28.030
The first wave of the war went decidedly in the Perian favor,

154
00:09:28.050 --> 00:09:30.870
and it didn't look like things were going to get better. The Romans,

155
00:09:30.871 --> 00:09:34.550
they were led by two emperors who were completely inexperienced in military

156
00:09:34.551 --> 00:09:38.500
matters. They also had threats to deal with in other frontier, provinces,

157
00:09:38.501 --> 00:09:41.660
such as Britain and Germania superior. Moreover,

158
00:09:41.920 --> 00:09:45.860
the defeat in subsequent retreat of the Roman forces in Syria created perfect

159
00:09:45.861 --> 00:09:47.100
conditions for rebellion.

160
00:09:47.101 --> 00:09:51.820
Eventually Marcus aureus decided that Lucia virus should go in person to

161
00:09:52.340 --> 00:09:55.300
going the war against Paia. If anyone was expecting virus,

162
00:09:55.630 --> 00:09:58.250
be a great inspiring commander. Well,

163
00:09:58.320 --> 00:10:02.570
this was the moment that did away with that notion, as it turns out,

164
00:10:02.970 --> 00:10:06.890
VE was the type of leader who preferred to pursue earthly delights and let

165
00:10:06.891 --> 00:10:09.170
others do the fighting for him. Allegedly,

166
00:10:09.171 --> 00:10:13.290
he spent most of the Pathan campaign to resort in antit Aqua.

167
00:10:13.430 --> 00:10:16.840
He feasted and gambled da surrounded lies underage.

168
00:10:17.140 --> 00:10:21.800
As it is said in the Historia Augusta while legions were being slaughtered while

169
00:10:21.810 --> 00:10:25.800
Syria meditated revolt and the east was being devastated,

170
00:10:26.320 --> 00:10:31.040
virus was hunting and Apulia traveling about through Athens and Corinth

171
00:10:31.041 --> 00:10:33.960
accompanied by orchestras singers. At this time,

172
00:10:34.060 --> 00:10:38.110
we should also point out that the veracity of the or Augusta is highly

173
00:10:38.111 --> 00:10:42.230
uncertain. So don't take anything from it as absolute truth.

174
00:10:42.650 --> 00:10:47.430
His part Cassie's do confirmed that various made his headquarters in antiar

175
00:10:47.930 --> 00:10:50.310
didn't personally take part in any battles,

176
00:10:50.370 --> 00:10:54.470
but made no mention of his party lifestyle, whatever the truth. Fortunately,

177
00:10:54.471 --> 00:10:54.831
for Rome,

178
00:10:54.831 --> 00:10:59.820
there were also a few capable general who left with veers and continued on their

179
00:10:59.940 --> 00:11:00.581
weight to Patha.

180
00:11:00.581 --> 00:11:05.060
Some of the more important ones were Marty Veris staus PR and

181
00:11:05.390 --> 00:11:09.820
Avidi Cassius. Remember that last one, as he is going to be important later,

182
00:11:10.190 --> 00:11:14.340
Marty Veris attacked, Armenia and conquered the capital of Artis sax.

183
00:11:14.720 --> 00:11:17.850
He then restored the heist to the throne. The previous king,

184
00:11:17.851 --> 00:11:22.010
who was subservient to Roman assumes the governorship of Kaha

185
00:11:22.400 --> 00:11:23.120
historian.

186
00:11:23.120 --> 00:11:28.090
Cassius Dio gives most of the credit for the eventual Roman victory to ADIs

187
00:11:28.120 --> 00:11:31.570
Cassius. After king VGAs is retreated back to Paia.

188
00:11:31.710 --> 00:11:34.170
He gave chase and in a hundred and sixty six eighty,

189
00:11:34.240 --> 00:11:38.400
they sat to the cities of Licia and to siphon the latter,

190
00:11:38.401 --> 00:11:41.880
being the Pathan capital afterwards, the videos made his way to Syria,

191
00:11:41.930 --> 00:11:46.120
where he eliminated any threat of a rebellion and was installed as the new

192
00:11:46.280 --> 00:11:47.600
governor of the province later,

193
00:11:47.620 --> 00:11:51.840
Marcus Aras would grant him control over all the Roman territories in Asia,

194
00:11:52.280 --> 00:11:54.520
a decision that he would come to regret.

195
00:11:54.940 --> 00:11:59.760
But one thing you certainly wouldn't regret is signing up for today's

196
00:11:59.761 --> 00:12:01.280
sponsor blinkers. Now, look,

197
00:12:01.350 --> 00:12:05.160
it's not always easy to find the time to sit down and read all the books you

198
00:12:05.360 --> 00:12:06.880
want. I'm a pretty busy dude myself.

199
00:12:06.940 --> 00:12:10.160
So I know that I don't have all the time to read that. I would like,

200
00:12:10.320 --> 00:12:13.070
I used to read a lot more, but like I say,

201
00:12:13.071 --> 00:12:17.030
I'm pretty busy these days and that's why it's good news because I have,

202
00:12:17.031 --> 00:12:21.630
Blinkus basically what it is is you download the app and you can get 15 minute

203
00:12:21.631 --> 00:12:26.430
summaries of some of basically the most important non-fiction books

204
00:12:26.620 --> 00:12:29.550
that exist. And this 3000 of them in here, by the way,

205
00:12:30.190 --> 00:12:32.750
15 minute summaries that are either written or in audio,

206
00:12:33.260 --> 00:12:35.460
I tend to get the audio ones. And what I do is like,

207
00:12:35.461 --> 00:12:38.060
it's about a 15 minute commute for work to work for me.

208
00:12:38.060 --> 00:12:42.940
So I tend to listen to one in the morning as I make my way recently,

209
00:12:43.490 --> 00:12:46.340
I've been going through, uh, this is one I read previously.

210
00:12:46.341 --> 00:12:49.860
That's actually a great recommendation. The snowball, which is Warren buffets.

211
00:12:50.020 --> 00:12:54.970
I think it's an it's, it's a biography, right? Not an auto it's great.

212
00:12:54.980 --> 00:12:58.090
There was also thoughtfulness, which is one I recently enjoyed.

213
00:12:58.370 --> 00:13:01.130
I mentioned this one last time. I think deep work by Cal Newport,

214
00:13:01.590 --> 00:13:04.650
all great stuff. There are actually 12 million people using this app,

215
00:13:04.651 --> 00:13:07.770
which is great. I'm just one in 12 million.

216
00:13:07.970 --> 00:13:12.450
I suppose it's got self-help to business, whatever you're into it's on there.

217
00:13:12.670 --> 00:13:16.400
So look the first hundred people to go to blinkers.com/biographics.

218
00:13:16.401 --> 00:13:19.880
You read a week to try it out. And if you want to stick with it,

219
00:13:19.881 --> 00:13:22.320
which I think you will, you're gonna get 25% off.

220
00:13:22.321 --> 00:13:25.640
If you want the full membership again, a seven day trial that you can

221
00:13:28.040 --> 00:13:30.840
cancel@anytimeatblinkers.com slash biographics, and let's get back to it.

222
00:13:37.300 --> 00:13:39.350
Despite just winning a war, things soon,

223
00:13:39.580 --> 00:13:41.510
went from bad to worse for the Roman em empire,

224
00:13:41.690 --> 00:13:44.310
the soldiers returning home did not come alone.

225
00:13:44.460 --> 00:13:48.430
They brought with them a mysterious illness that started one of the first known

226
00:13:48.670 --> 00:13:50.990
pandemics in history. It became known as the,

227
00:13:51.110 --> 00:13:54.990
an nine plague also known as the plague of Gaylen named after the,

228
00:13:55.300 --> 00:13:58.940
the Greek physician who described the disease and symptoms in his treatise,

229
00:13:59.090 --> 00:14:03.020
Methodist me Endi. It caused fever, vomiting, swollen, throat diarrhea,

230
00:14:03.370 --> 00:14:04.203
thirstiness,

231
00:14:04.240 --> 00:14:08.300
and violent coughing fits that produced a foul loader and skin rashes all over

232
00:14:08.301 --> 00:14:08.720
the body.

233
00:14:08.720 --> 00:14:11.940
The illness lasted for about two weeks and the ones fortunate enough to survive.

234
00:14:11.941 --> 00:14:13.940
It became immune from further infection.

235
00:14:14.240 --> 00:14:17.050
The exact nature of the disease ease is still somewhat of a mystery.

236
00:14:17.330 --> 00:14:21.010
Smallpox and measles were generally regarded as the most likely culprits,

237
00:14:21.011 --> 00:14:22.610
both capable of ravaging,

238
00:14:22.611 --> 00:14:26.650
a population that had no resistance to them whatsoever. In more recent times,

239
00:14:26.670 --> 00:14:29.970
the second candidate has fallen outta favor and both scholars and doctors

240
00:14:30.000 --> 00:14:32.770
believe smallpox was the true cause of the plague.

241
00:14:32.880 --> 00:14:36.560
They points archeological evidence that depict people infected with the on

242
00:14:36.561 --> 00:14:40.080
displaying the postals typically associated with smallpox.

243
00:14:40.081 --> 00:14:43.160
While the Romans picked up the plague while campaigning in Paia,

244
00:14:43.420 --> 00:14:45.600
the exact origins are sh shouted in legend.

245
00:14:45.770 --> 00:14:47.640
There are multiple versions of the story,

246
00:14:47.700 --> 00:14:51.000
but they all seem to suggest that the disease was punishment from the gods

247
00:14:51.120 --> 00:14:53.440
because the Romans allegedly broken oath,

248
00:14:53.441 --> 00:14:56.800
they made to not pillage the city of Licia,

249
00:14:56.820 --> 00:15:00.360
trying to determine the impact of the pandemic with accuracy is impossible.

250
00:15:00.510 --> 00:15:02.880
Some say that it wasn't as bad as everyone thinks,

251
00:15:02.881 --> 00:15:07.000
and it demonstrated the resilience of Rome while others believe it marked the

252
00:15:07.001 --> 00:15:10.200
beginning of the fall of the Western Roman empire at its height.

253
00:15:10.530 --> 00:15:14.230
It killed thousands of people a day as it spread throughout all the Roman

254
00:15:14.510 --> 00:15:17.430
territories, it lasted until 180, 80 D.

255
00:15:17.710 --> 00:15:21.870
And some believed that the plague of Sipri which appeared 70 years later was in

256
00:15:21.871 --> 00:15:23.870
fact, another outbreak of the same illness.

257
00:15:24.510 --> 00:15:28.950
Vastly the Anon plague may have claimed the life of Lucius virus while we don't

258
00:15:28.951 --> 00:15:33.580
have details surrounding his demise virus for LL on 169 ad and died

259
00:15:33.840 --> 00:15:38.260
on January the 23rd, leaving Marcus aureus as the so emperor of Rome,

260
00:15:44.560 --> 00:15:48.860
The an nine plague was just one of the crises that Marcus aureus had to contend

261
00:15:48.861 --> 00:15:51.260
with following the end of the Pathan war.

262
00:15:51.261 --> 00:15:55.890
The other one was barbarian invasions by Germanic peoples along its Northern

263
00:15:55.960 --> 00:15:56.451
borders,

264
00:15:56.451 --> 00:16:00.970
which was also known as the limes Ticus such border conflicts were

265
00:16:00.971 --> 00:16:05.130
relatively common for the Romans and represented an almost constant threat to

266
00:16:05.250 --> 00:16:07.010
their outmost provinces. In fact,

267
00:16:07.160 --> 00:16:09.010
when the enemy was strong and determined enough,

268
00:16:09.011 --> 00:16:12.920
they represented a threat to Rome itself as just a centuries later,

269
00:16:13.100 --> 00:16:17.480
the heart of the empire was sacked multiple times by invading goths and vandals.

270
00:16:17.580 --> 00:16:20.000
The situation was not as di this time arounds,

271
00:16:20.001 --> 00:16:24.080
but the Roman empire was clearly at a disadvantage. It had just finished a war,

272
00:16:24.081 --> 00:16:27.680
meaning that its coffers were getting empty and its people were growing weary of

273
00:16:27.960 --> 00:16:28.230
conflict.

274
00:16:28.230 --> 00:16:31.600
Most of its Northern border was poorly defended because the troops had been

275
00:16:31.840 --> 00:16:35.510
redirected to par AIA and last, but certainly by no means,

276
00:16:35.600 --> 00:16:37.750
least that was the plague to deal with.

277
00:16:37.930 --> 00:16:40.470
It certainly seems like an opportune time to attack,

278
00:16:40.490 --> 00:16:43.710
but scholars are still debating over the exact motive for the invasion.

279
00:16:44.100 --> 00:16:46.990
Some believe that the most obvious answer is true.

280
00:16:47.130 --> 00:16:50.830
The dramatic tribe simply sought to take advantage of the weakened state of the

281
00:16:50.831 --> 00:16:51.431
Roman empire.

282
00:16:51.431 --> 00:16:55.540
Others speculate that in might have been overpopulation or another threat from

283
00:16:55.541 --> 00:16:55.861
the east,

284
00:16:55.861 --> 00:17:00.100
which forced them to expand west the main belligerence beside the Romans of

285
00:17:00.101 --> 00:17:03.540
course, worthy Germanic macro money. Hence the name macro war.

286
00:17:03.690 --> 00:17:07.700
They were joined by another Germanic tribe called the QI and the laser G who

287
00:17:07.860 --> 00:17:11.860
were actually, uh, summation people originating in the steps of Eurasia.

288
00:17:11.890 --> 00:17:13.500
They were assisted by various other.

289
00:17:13.590 --> 00:17:17.730
The tribes as the mathematic wars were a major conflict that lasted for almost

290
00:17:17.790 --> 00:17:21.610
two decades and extended into the reign of Marcus. Orus a successor.

291
00:17:21.630 --> 00:17:26.090
The leader of the opposing forces was BMA king of the macro Manny Cassius S Dio

292
00:17:26.091 --> 00:17:28.770
first mentioned him for acting as mediator,

293
00:17:28.771 --> 00:17:31.730
following some barbarian skirmishes into Roman territory.

294
00:17:31.760 --> 00:17:35.840
This happens in the years shortly before the outbreak of the war and involved

295
00:17:35.841 --> 00:17:37.120
other dramatic tribes,

296
00:17:37.150 --> 00:17:40.880
such as the longer bards and the U on the one side and,

297
00:17:41.080 --> 00:17:42.640
and Marcus Jaus basses,

298
00:17:42.920 --> 00:17:46.200
then governor of the Roman province of ponia inferior on the other,

299
00:17:46.230 --> 00:17:49.560
what exactly persuaded BA Lamar to turn into an aggressor. We don't know,

300
00:17:49.561 --> 00:17:51.560
but in 166 ad,

301
00:17:51.561 --> 00:17:55.920
he United several tribes and crossed the Dan to lead incursions into Roman

302
00:17:56.240 --> 00:17:59.480
territory because of the other problems in the empire Marx or realists was ready

303
00:17:59.500 --> 00:18:00.333
to respond.

304
00:18:00.380 --> 00:18:05.280
The Roman army marched to Pinon and sat up a base at Aquile this time,

305
00:18:05.470 --> 00:18:09.670
both embers were there to lead the troops. According to who the Historia August,

306
00:18:10.070 --> 00:18:14.070
any tribal leaders immediately started retreating or asking for pardons for a

307
00:18:14.230 --> 00:18:17.750
while. It seems like this conflict would fizzle out as soon as it started.

308
00:18:17.970 --> 00:18:21.230
But Marcus sores was concerned that this was all Aloy.

309
00:18:21.660 --> 00:18:24.110
Toal the time he wanted to keep pursuing the enemy.

310
00:18:24.370 --> 00:18:29.300
But this was when Lucius virus fell ill and died. The remaining emperor, uh,

311
00:18:29.320 --> 00:18:32.900
had to return to Rome to make preparations for his brother's funeral. Marcus,

312
00:18:33.060 --> 00:18:36.460
a res returned to the battle later that same year accompanied by his general.

313
00:18:36.720 --> 00:18:40.660
And son-in-law, Claudias pompous a little side note here,

314
00:18:40.661 --> 00:18:45.260
Cassius S D singled out POAs as the military commander who distinguished himself

315
00:18:45.440 --> 00:18:50.210
the most during the macro war alongside another left tenants named per

316
00:18:50.450 --> 00:18:50.630
a,

317
00:18:50.630 --> 00:18:54.450
who would go on to become emperor during one of the most tumultuous periods in

318
00:18:54.451 --> 00:18:57.610
Roman history? Well, that's the story for another day for now.

319
00:18:57.611 --> 00:19:00.410
We see the barbarian tribes gaining the upper hand in the war.

320
00:19:00.630 --> 00:19:04.970
The Leese invaded the provinces of MOIA and Deia and Guild.

321
00:19:05.110 --> 00:19:08.890
The governor Claudias Franzo who served as general during the Paron war.

322
00:19:08.900 --> 00:19:12.560
Other tribes went Reese and destroyed one of the most important religious sites

323
00:19:12.580 --> 00:19:15.560
in the Roman, em empire, the temple of Ellucian mysteries,

324
00:19:15.740 --> 00:19:18.480
but the macro Manny were the most dangerous of all.

325
00:19:18.670 --> 00:19:22.800
They scored a decisive victory at Carto in 170 a D,

326
00:19:22.801 --> 00:19:27.360
where they faced off against an inexperienced Roman army and sled 20,000

327
00:19:27.361 --> 00:19:27.990
soldiers.

328
00:19:27.990 --> 00:19:31.790
They kept pushing until they reached Italy itself of marking the first time in

329
00:19:31.791 --> 00:19:32.950
over 270 years,

330
00:19:32.951 --> 00:19:36.790
that an enemy of Rome managed to penetrate into the heart of the empire.

331
00:19:37.190 --> 00:19:40.950
Marcus really has realized that the macro Manny posed the greatest threat and

332
00:19:41.190 --> 00:19:44.590
considered them a priority when launching a counter offensive legions from other

333
00:19:44.750 --> 00:19:47.190
frontiers were rerouted to fight balmar and well,

334
00:19:47.191 --> 00:19:50.590
this strategy approved its successful by the end of a hundred and seventy one

335
00:19:50.590 --> 00:19:51.160
eighty. They,

336
00:19:51.160 --> 00:19:55.060
the macro Manny out of Roman territory and continued their pursuit across the

337
00:19:55.260 --> 00:19:57.180
Dan new until the macro Manny were defeated.

338
00:19:57.480 --> 00:20:01.580
The other smaller tribes began seeking audiences with Marcus aureus.

339
00:20:01.610 --> 00:20:04.420
Some of them surrendered others offered alliances.

340
00:20:04.600 --> 00:20:08.820
The QI agreed to a peace treaty, but then broke it and went to war again.

341
00:20:09.500 --> 00:20:13.530
Aureus defeated them once more and installed a Roman king called 30th,

342
00:20:13.670 --> 00:20:17.690
but the QDI deposed him and renewed hostilities yet again,

343
00:20:17.910 --> 00:20:21.210
the two signs met in battle and the QDI would've defeated the Romans,

344
00:20:21.211 --> 00:20:24.730
if not for divine intervention, according to Cassius Dio,

345
00:20:24.731 --> 00:20:28.730
at least he says that one of Marcus are really is as re in Egyptian magician

346
00:20:29.170 --> 00:20:33.720
called are NUS prayed to mercury and summoned while the Romans were invigorated

347
00:20:33.780 --> 00:20:38.280
by the pouring rain, the quad struck by lightning and engulfed in flames,

348
00:20:38.281 --> 00:20:41.080
nothing as dramatic happens with the lass though,

349
00:20:41.190 --> 00:20:43.840
they simply surrendered and their king Zant.

350
00:20:44.120 --> 00:20:47.480
Tookus agreed to the terms set out by Marcus or aureus.

351
00:20:47.780 --> 00:20:50.920
The Empress triumphs are recorded on the column of Marcus Aurelia,

352
00:20:50.921 --> 00:20:53.400
still located in the Piazza Colonna in Rome.

353
00:20:53.620 --> 00:20:57.480
It was modeled on the Tramal column of tra who celebrated his victories over the

354
00:20:57.840 --> 00:20:59.600
nations. Also during his years in battle,

355
00:21:00.000 --> 00:21:02.520
Marcus aureus started writing down his personal philosophies,

356
00:21:02.521 --> 00:21:06.280
which forms the basis for one of the most influential works on stoicism.

357
00:21:06.740 --> 00:21:10.630
Even today, his book titled meditations is still a popular seller,

358
00:21:10.950 --> 00:21:13.310
although the emperor never intended it to be published.

359
00:21:13.410 --> 00:21:17.350
So I'll argue that he wrote it for himself, others, that it was for his sons,

360
00:21:17.520 --> 00:21:21.070
going back to the battle. This was only the first Aman war.

361
00:21:21.250 --> 00:21:24.430
It was the biggest of all of them, but it was followed by two more.

362
00:21:24.610 --> 00:21:29.220
It has been speculated that Marcus really is a grander ambitions and might have

363
00:21:29.221 --> 00:21:32.700
wanted to eliminate the threat permanently during the first war and establish

364
00:21:32.840 --> 00:21:35.580
new Roman provinces. However, he had little choice,

365
00:21:35.600 --> 00:21:38.060
but to accept quick victories and peace treaties,

366
00:21:38.280 --> 00:21:42.260
his attention was needed elsewhere. As trouble was brewing in Syria.

367
00:21:49.010 --> 00:21:51.890
Remember avid Cassius, the general from the path war,

368
00:21:52.130 --> 00:21:56.090
he was in charge of Syria in the surrounding provinces while in a hundred and

369
00:21:56.090 --> 00:21:56.150
seventy five eighty,

370
00:21:56.150 --> 00:22:00.330
he decided to rise up against Marcus Aures and declare himself the new emperor

371
00:22:00.331 --> 00:22:02.770
of Rome. While there is controversy surrounding his motives.

372
00:22:02.930 --> 00:22:06.890
He did it because word had reached him that Aures had died during the ATIC war,

373
00:22:07.000 --> 00:22:11.480
even more controversy historian Cass's Dio pointed the finger at Faustina,

374
00:22:11.620 --> 00:22:15.680
the emperor's wife as being the one who engineered this deception, allegedly,

375
00:22:15.780 --> 00:22:19.520
she also believed that her husband would die in the war and feared that an

376
00:22:19.760 --> 00:22:22.320
outsider would kill her son and take the throne by force.

377
00:22:22.470 --> 00:22:24.600
Therefore she preferred Cassius as Emper,

378
00:22:24.601 --> 00:22:27.680
because he would not take such drastic measures. Anyway,

379
00:22:27.681 --> 00:22:30.710
Cassius eventually found out the Marcus aureus was still alive,

380
00:22:30.810 --> 00:22:33.390
but by then it was too late to go back. Well,

381
00:22:33.590 --> 00:22:36.630
actually it might not have been if we're going by Dio. Again,

382
00:22:36.990 --> 00:22:40.870
people trade Marcus aureus as one of the most gracious Roman em, in history,

383
00:22:40.871 --> 00:22:44.110
because he was not only willing to forgive the man who was once one of his

384
00:22:44.111 --> 00:22:47.590
strongest allies, but also said in a speech that if the soldiers,

385
00:22:47.591 --> 00:22:50.140
Senate and people of own had Cassius over him,

386
00:22:50.440 --> 00:22:53.580
he would surrender his power without struggle. Of course,

387
00:22:53.610 --> 00:22:56.940
this may have all simply been a way of rallying the troops to his site.

388
00:22:56.990 --> 00:22:57.581
After all,

389
00:22:57.581 --> 00:23:01.500
what Marcus Aures actually did was end the macro manic war as fast as possible.

390
00:23:01.680 --> 00:23:05.820
And head to Asia with his army. Meanwhile, Cassius was raising his own force,

391
00:23:05.840 --> 00:23:07.300
but a battle between the two,

392
00:23:07.500 --> 00:23:11.610
it never took place just three months after the Elliot started general Caius was

393
00:23:12.010 --> 00:23:15.290
assassinated by his own men who were still loyal to the true Emper.

394
00:23:15.590 --> 00:23:17.290
His head was brought to Marcus, or,

395
00:23:17.770 --> 00:23:21.650
but he allegedly refused to see it and ordered it buried whether or not Faustina

396
00:23:21.651 --> 00:23:26.050
was involved in the plot remains uncertain, but she also died that same year,

397
00:23:26.100 --> 00:23:27.490
regardless of her intentions,

398
00:23:27.710 --> 00:23:32.320
her husband remained devoted to her and a fighters gave her a lavish funeral

399
00:23:32.590 --> 00:23:36.880
with a rebellion over Marcus aureus was finally able to return to Rome where he

400
00:23:36.881 --> 00:23:38.880
had his son Commodus named emperor.

401
00:23:38.990 --> 00:23:43.120
Initially he intended two of his sons to rule the empire as he had done with

402
00:23:43.710 --> 00:23:47.640
Luve. But his other rare NA as Faris died when he was just a boy,

403
00:23:47.930 --> 00:23:52.400
peace was brief as the Ember had to leave in 177 to fight in the second

404
00:23:53.040 --> 00:23:57.000
Maman war, he would never return to Rome again, as he died on March the 17th,

405
00:23:57.960 --> 00:24:02.120
180 at VIN Bonna modern day Vienna, he was 58 years old.

406
00:24:02.260 --> 00:24:06.230
And although he was seemingly a man who chaired wisdom and Emon,

407
00:24:06.490 --> 00:24:10.790
he was forced to spend almost his entire reign plunged into war and chaos.

408
00:24:11.130 --> 00:24:14.310
He was followed by his son commodes. He was the antithesis of his father,

409
00:24:14.600 --> 00:24:19.070
cruel vain, Mercs, DED, inept, and a complete megalomaniac.

410
00:24:19.080 --> 00:24:23.390
Never again would mighty Rome reach the same Heights as Casillo put it.

411
00:24:23.391 --> 00:24:25.220
After the death of Marcus ARA us,

412
00:24:25.221 --> 00:24:29.780
the empire descended from a kingdom of gold to one of iron

413
00:24:30.360 --> 00:24:33.820
and rust. So I really hope you found that video. Interesting. If you did,
