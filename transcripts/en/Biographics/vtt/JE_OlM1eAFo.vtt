4
00:00:15.700 --> 00:00:19.960
He was a king who's rain out, Sean, even the sun, Louie,

5
00:00:19.961 --> 00:00:24.070
the 14th of France was one of history's major monarchs ruling with absolute

6
00:00:24.071 --> 00:00:27.270
power for nearly three quarters of a century in Europe.

7
00:00:27.370 --> 00:00:29.630
The length of his rule is unmatched globally.

8
00:00:29.870 --> 00:00:33.790
His reputation is nearly unparalleled under the sun Kings watch the French

9
00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:34.610
experience,

10
00:00:34.610 --> 00:00:39.430
the grass Syla or the great C the period Aire called one of the

11
00:00:39.431 --> 00:00:43.180
great centuries of civiliz art culture and fashion.

12
00:00:43.400 --> 00:00:47.860
All flourished Versai was built. Power was centralized along its borders,

13
00:00:47.880 --> 00:00:52.580
France expanded becoming the undisputed focal point of European life.

14
00:00:52.880 --> 00:00:57.100
But was there more to the reign of Louie the 14th than a shiny French utopia

15
00:00:57.250 --> 00:01:01.060
born into a time of civil strife. Louis was a product of war.

16
00:01:01.200 --> 00:01:05.610
He constantly against his neighbors against Protestants and against the world.

17
00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:08.610
And even as his armies racked up victories,

18
00:01:08.920 --> 00:01:12.410
they sewed the seeds of Lara SI's bitter end,

19
00:01:12.850 --> 00:01:16.730
but of the great towering figures of history. This is the complex life,

20
00:01:17.050 --> 00:01:19.090
a France's brightest Royal star.

21
00:01:25.660 --> 00:01:28.520
It was a dark and stormy night. And no,

22
00:01:28.580 --> 00:01:32.920
we are not cribbing lines from Snoopy's typewriter. That is literally, uh,

23
00:01:32.921 --> 00:01:35.600
the story of Louis. The 14th starts. Anyway,

24
00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:40.480
it was a dark and stormy night and Louis the 13th was cursing. His awful luck.

25
00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:41.920
Thanks to implement weather.

26
00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:46.750
The king of France had become trapped at the apartments of his wife and of

27
00:01:46.751 --> 00:01:47.380
Austria.

28
00:01:47.380 --> 00:01:52.030
This was a problem because Louie the 13th and Anne detested one another,

29
00:01:52.470 --> 00:01:54.670
not in an arguing about the dishes kind of way.

30
00:01:54.671 --> 00:01:57.030
<v 1>This was a hatred that burned so bright.</v>

31
00:01:57.050 --> 00:02:00.230
It could probably have been seen from space as a result.

32
00:02:00.330 --> 00:02:04.460
The raw couple hadn't produced a single aired during their long marriage.

33
00:02:04.970 --> 00:02:07.940
That all changed that stormy night, trapped it together,

34
00:02:08.340 --> 00:02:11.140
Louie the 13th and Anne evidently put aside their differences.

35
00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:13.020
By the time the sun rose the next morning,

36
00:02:13.540 --> 00:02:14.900
Anne was pregnant with the future king.

37
00:02:15.320 --> 00:02:17.140
<v 0>At least that's the official version.</v>

38
00:02:17.480 --> 00:02:21.580
The unofficial one is that Anne may have been canoeing with her confidants,

39
00:02:22.020 --> 00:02:26.850
Cardinal JUULs Mazari and the darkened stormy night was a story concocted

40
00:02:26.870 --> 00:02:30.210
to save everyone a bit of embarrassment, whatever the truth.

41
00:02:30.400 --> 00:02:33.450
Nine months later on September the fifth, 1638,

42
00:02:33.670 --> 00:02:37.290
the future son king was born almost from the moment he emerged. Louis.

43
00:02:37.291 --> 00:02:41.210
The 14th was being force fed evidence of his own importance.

44
00:02:41.730 --> 00:02:46.680
Anne was a strict Catholic who told her son he was chosen by God to lead France

45
00:02:46.870 --> 00:02:49.960
ever giving him the nickname Dodo given by God.

46
00:02:50.150 --> 00:02:52.640
When Louis's brother Filip was born two years later,

47
00:02:52.860 --> 00:02:57.760
she made the boy wear dresses and referred to him as my little girl as if to

48
00:02:57.761 --> 00:03:01.680
remove any threat that he might pose to Louis's claim on the throne.

49
00:03:01.900 --> 00:03:05.400
Not that Louis's childhood was all pampered though, for one thing,

50
00:03:05.420 --> 00:03:09.160
Anne's belief in God's plan for her son made her somewhat careless as a mother.

51
00:03:09.380 --> 00:03:13.240
The future king nearly drowned as a toddler because Anne wasn't paying attention

52
00:03:13.540 --> 00:03:14.373
for another thing.

53
00:03:14.640 --> 00:03:18.950
Louis had been born into mid 17th century France and mid century.

54
00:03:19.010 --> 00:03:23.070
France was a society devouring itself rather than a unified nation.

55
00:03:23.990 --> 00:03:28.510
1640s France was badly fractured with many provinces under defacto control of

56
00:03:28.690 --> 00:03:33.470
not the crown, but powerful Nobles. When Louis the 13th died in 1643,

57
00:03:34.030 --> 00:03:38.870
Anne and Cardinal Mazan set it up a Regency to rule in Louis the 14th name

58
00:03:39.120 --> 00:03:43.220
and tried to reign in the power of these Nobles. Unfortunately,

59
00:03:43.550 --> 00:03:48.060
those Nobles would rather burn the world than let their power decrease.

60
00:03:48.320 --> 00:03:53.060
In 1648, France exploded into an ugly civil war known as the Fran.

61
00:03:53.330 --> 00:03:56.740
This happens right in the middle of a war with Spain, other France height,

62
00:03:56.940 --> 00:04:00.770
a Perian mob storms, the raw palace for Louise's blood.

63
00:04:00.960 --> 00:04:05.330
Luckily this particular mob was less interested in recreational decapitation

64
00:04:05.331 --> 00:04:09.010
than most per Perian mobs. And as they left Louis alive,

65
00:04:09.011 --> 00:04:12.970
after the boy pretended to be asleep still the incident badly scarred him for

66
00:04:12.971 --> 00:04:13.804
the rest of his life.

67
00:04:14.210 --> 00:04:18.290
Louie would regard the French capital with utmost loathing by 1654,

68
00:04:18.580 --> 00:04:21.360
Mazan had won the Fran for the crown that same summer,

69
00:04:21.420 --> 00:04:25.920
the Cardinal had 15 year old Louis crowns king and a ceremony attended by almost

70
00:04:26.020 --> 00:04:28.400
no one, not the Merin needed the crowds.

71
00:04:28.540 --> 00:04:32.280
He was the real power behind the teenage king and everyone already knew it,

72
00:04:32.620 --> 00:04:35.840
but mare wasn't the cartoon villain you're probably expecting,

73
00:04:36.160 --> 00:04:38.280
although he kept Louis the 14th on a short leash,

74
00:04:38.500 --> 00:04:43.030
he also taught him the dark arts of politics, how to manipulate people,

75
00:04:43.250 --> 00:04:44.310
how to convince them.

76
00:04:44.340 --> 00:04:49.150
Your great idea was actually their great idea gifts that would serve the

77
00:04:49.151 --> 00:04:50.470
young king very well.

78
00:04:50.610 --> 00:04:54.350
But Mazan also gave the boy a gift that he was less happy with.

79
00:04:54.580 --> 00:04:59.310
When Louie decided to marry mare's niece Mazan was all like, uh, no,

80
00:04:59.450 --> 00:05:03.260
you're actually gonna marry this princess to symbolically mark the end of this

81
00:05:03.261 --> 00:05:07.820
stupid war that we've been fighting. Just deal with it. And that was how in 16,

82
00:05:07.821 --> 00:05:11.820
60 Louis, the 14th came to marry Maria Teresa of Spain, a woman.

83
00:05:12.040 --> 00:05:16.100
He hated only marginally less than his father had hated Anne.

84
00:05:16.320 --> 00:05:18.780
But if this seemed like an ignoble start for the king,

85
00:05:18.800 --> 00:05:21.460
who would be the most celebrated in French history,

86
00:05:21.880 --> 00:05:26.530
just know that it's not going to last less than nine months after his unwanted

87
00:05:26.730 --> 00:05:27.290
marriage.

88
00:05:27.290 --> 00:05:32.250
Louis would be stepping out from behind Mazan shadow and in to the blinding

89
00:05:32.530 --> 00:05:33.363
sunlight

90
00:05:38.990 --> 00:05:40.850
On March the ninth, 1661,

91
00:05:41.090 --> 00:05:44.480
Cardinal Mazan for the great Catholic party in the sky.

92
00:05:44.540 --> 00:05:47.600
The very next day blew the 14th, made a surprise announcement.

93
00:05:47.700 --> 00:05:51.200
He would not be replacing Cardinal Mazan with a new chief minister.

94
00:05:51.350 --> 00:05:54.400
Instead he would rule France as an absolute Monarch.

95
00:05:54.550 --> 00:05:57.480
This was one bosy move in 17th century.

96
00:05:57.500 --> 00:06:00.640
France last absolute mono had been Henry the fourth,

97
00:06:00.920 --> 00:06:03.960
who rule had ended over 50 years ago. This was like,

98
00:06:04.200 --> 00:06:06.440
hell Cole casually announcing in 1995,

99
00:06:06.441 --> 00:06:09.640
that Germany was going to revert to a military dictatorship.

100
00:06:10.200 --> 00:06:12.160
How hell would such a thing even be possible?

101
00:06:12.580 --> 00:06:17.350
But Lou was adamant had been put on earth by God to rule and

102
00:06:17.450 --> 00:06:21.590
by God. Well, he was gonna rule the heck outta France, the show he was serious.

103
00:06:22.190 --> 00:06:25.990
Lou had paintings commissioned of himself as Roman emperors and Greek gods.

104
00:06:26.010 --> 00:06:29.150
He declared himself. Roy sole, the son king.

105
00:06:29.420 --> 00:06:32.550
This caused some rumblings among the Nobles rumblings.

106
00:06:32.750 --> 00:06:36.590
Louis would've been ill advised to ignore including the Frans that Nobles had

107
00:06:36.591 --> 00:06:41.140
started 11 civil wars in the last four decades to paraphrase the old meme.

108
00:06:41.440 --> 00:06:45.940
One did not simply declare oneself above the Nobles without a fight,

109
00:06:46.200 --> 00:06:48.900
but Louis did not want a fight. No.

110
00:06:48.960 --> 00:06:53.460
His plans for conquering the Nobles involved using the subtle arts that Mazan

111
00:06:53.461 --> 00:06:57.300
had taught him. But first he needed a place to do it. Construction.

112
00:06:57.590 --> 00:07:01.570
The palace of Versai began in 1661 using as its core,

113
00:07:01.850 --> 00:07:05.090
an old Royal hunting lodge, some 20 kilometers outside of Paris.

114
00:07:05.850 --> 00:07:08.010
Remember Howie had said, Louis hated Paris.

115
00:07:08.280 --> 00:07:13.170
Well Versai was an expression of that hate 20 kilometers away may not sound like

116
00:07:13.171 --> 00:07:16.010
much, but when your main form of transport is horse drawn carriage,

117
00:07:16.550 --> 00:07:19.720
it sure feels a lot. And that was kind of the point.

118
00:07:20.200 --> 00:07:22.040
Louis wanted to separate himself from the capital.

119
00:07:22.220 --> 00:07:25.360
He also wanted to separate his court from anywhere.

120
00:07:25.500 --> 00:07:30.080
The Nobles might have allies. If he could lure them away from their power bases,

121
00:07:30.180 --> 00:07:32.320
if he could dazzle them with opulence,

122
00:07:32.460 --> 00:07:35.400
if he could occupy their brains completely with courtly life,

123
00:07:35.830 --> 00:07:39.230
well then they might not have enough time for civil war.

124
00:07:39.490 --> 00:07:42.750
At first Louis's clever plan. It didn't quite pan out.

125
00:07:42.900 --> 00:07:47.550
Noble's declared Versai is a mistres without a Meriter way of saying that it

126
00:07:47.551 --> 00:07:50.510
looked like a building site and there was nothing to do.

127
00:07:50.690 --> 00:07:52.990
But the sun king didn't wa in his course,

128
00:07:53.350 --> 00:07:55.630
although the court moved around endlessly in these days,

129
00:07:55.910 --> 00:07:59.820
it kept coming back to Fay. And when it did Louis ensured,

130
00:07:59.821 --> 00:08:04.340
there was enough to occupy even the most macve mind. There were hunting trips,

131
00:08:04.580 --> 00:08:09.260
gambling parties of such extravagance that engravings were made and sent how two

132
00:08:09.261 --> 00:08:13.140
guides to the other courts of Europe, even the clothing worn was time consuming.

133
00:08:13.580 --> 00:08:14.021
Louis decreed.

134
00:08:14.021 --> 00:08:17.980
It must be French made at enormous cast and that only certain people could wear

135
00:08:17.981 --> 00:08:21.770
certain colors. Naturally, this created competition among the Nobles elites,

136
00:08:21.771 --> 00:08:25.050
who might otherwise have been discussing a big budget sequel to the front,

137
00:08:25.370 --> 00:08:28.770
where instead scheming against one another have heard the right to wear blue

138
00:08:28.800 --> 00:08:33.090
with gold and Louis backed all this weird new etiquette with action

139
00:08:33.550 --> 00:08:36.850
Nobles who played by the rules, found themselves getting showered with gold.

140
00:08:36.990 --> 00:08:37.720
Not literally.

141
00:08:37.720 --> 00:08:42.200
<v 1>That would be horrific while those who used were suddenly staring at empty</v>

142
00:08:42.600 --> 00:08:46.480
coffees, just as an exclusive new club can attract members purely because it is

143
00:08:46.510 --> 00:08:47.300
exclusive.

144
00:08:47.300 --> 00:08:51.640
The sun Kings court pulled in the Nobles purely because being there demonstrated

145
00:08:51.710 --> 00:08:52.543
your ability.

146
00:08:52.620 --> 00:08:56.160
You can see this clearest in the weird rituals undertaken each day,

147
00:08:56.270 --> 00:09:00.120
come morning. All the Nobles were expected to watch Louie get dressed with some,

148
00:09:00.230 --> 00:09:03.680
even helping the king into his shot, but rather than punishment,

149
00:09:03.820 --> 00:09:04.760
the act of dressing,

150
00:09:04.761 --> 00:09:09.560
the king was a reward and expression of a Nobles closeness to power and

151
00:09:09.561 --> 00:09:13.480
closeness to power meant money before long Lou had the Nobles where he wanted

152
00:09:13.481 --> 00:09:17.790
them fighting over were objectively ridiculous rituals while he floated Seren

153
00:09:17.840 --> 00:09:22.310
above it all like some kind of ancient sun got it was the first big step

154
00:09:22.650 --> 00:09:24.430
on the road to LA Gras Sierra.

155
00:09:24.850 --> 00:09:26.110
<v 0>It wouldn't be the last</v>

156
00:09:32.320 --> 00:09:36.020
While. The great parties of AAI may have been way of dazzling.

157
00:09:36.021 --> 00:09:39.500
The Nobles like waving a light bulb in front of a bunch of moth swearing,

158
00:09:39.650 --> 00:09:40.980
tiny powdered wigs.

159
00:09:40.981 --> 00:09:44.660
That didn't mean the sun king was all calculation and no fun.

160
00:09:44.760 --> 00:09:47.420
One of the nicknames for the Sierra was the reign of love.

161
00:09:47.640 --> 00:09:52.380
And it wasn't meant in the sense of the love that a man has for a fine

162
00:09:52.510 --> 00:09:56.330
Cuban cigar throughout his reign, the sun king. So many affairs,

163
00:09:56.390 --> 00:10:00.450
he practically made infidelity into a spectator sport though,

164
00:10:00.570 --> 00:10:04.890
was Louise der made of honor to Louis's sister-in-law Henrietta of England,

165
00:10:05.090 --> 00:10:08.410
who Louise started pretending to see his cover for one of his other affairs and

166
00:10:08.460 --> 00:10:10.410
wound up sleeping with her anyway,

167
00:10:10.470 --> 00:10:12.050
but he didn't just stop with sleeping with her.

168
00:10:12.410 --> 00:10:15.370
Louise was elevated to the position of King's official mistres,

169
00:10:15.371 --> 00:10:19.400
which has to be the most French concept that we've ever heard.

170
00:10:19.580 --> 00:10:23.240
And she was kept in luxury at her SI until her downfall.

171
00:10:23.241 --> 00:10:27.240
That is Louis was eventually deposed and replaced by Marquis depo,

172
00:10:27.560 --> 00:10:31.480
a woman of vast temper under which so cutting. She caused object terror,

173
00:10:31.920 --> 00:10:34.800
but off Louis who set her up in her own private departments ad joining his own.

174
00:10:34.801 --> 00:10:38.990
So we could have sex with her three times day Abbot that resulted in them having

175
00:10:39.040 --> 00:10:39.873
seven children,

176
00:10:40.590 --> 00:10:44.110
Louise meanwhile was packed off to a convent to live outta the rest of her life

177
00:10:44.111 --> 00:10:46.070
in isolation. When she eventually died,

178
00:10:46.130 --> 00:10:49.110
the king could barely manage a shrug of indifference,

179
00:10:49.290 --> 00:10:51.710
but while the Marquis became Louis's main lover,

180
00:10:51.970 --> 00:10:55.030
she wasn't the only one that Henrietta of England. We mentioned earlier,

181
00:10:55.100 --> 00:10:58.940
wife of Louise's brother Philippe while Louis totally seduced her too.

182
00:10:59.240 --> 00:11:03.020
Not that fully likely minded as he was himself sneaking off a nighttime Tris

183
00:11:03.090 --> 00:11:06.380
with buff man's man, the Chava de Lorraine. In fact,

184
00:11:06.410 --> 00:11:09.260
this whole attitude of free love permeated the sun Kings court,

185
00:11:09.820 --> 00:11:14.020
everyone was sleeping with everyone in a nonstop orgy of well orgys.

186
00:11:14.080 --> 00:11:18.570
But if that sounds kind of fun to you just know that it was only a 48 tiny

187
00:11:18.700 --> 00:11:21.730
elite. Most of the regular folks of France were starving.

188
00:11:21.731 --> 00:11:25.250
Those working on the Vai building site were barely making enough to afford food.

189
00:11:25.420 --> 00:11:28.730
Those who complained were thrown in jail. So yes,

190
00:11:28.870 --> 00:11:33.050
the great century was great for most people in the same way that the great

191
00:11:33.051 --> 00:11:37.570
depression was great for the average human I E not at all still.

192
00:11:37.571 --> 00:11:41.120
It's not like Louis was only playing mind games and making love despite having

193
00:11:41.121 --> 00:11:44.880
an adultery schedule that would leave even Boris with an exhausted Johnson.

194
00:11:45.840 --> 00:11:50.160
Lou found time to work for eight hours a day on kingly stuff every day,

195
00:11:50.370 --> 00:11:54.160
along with finance minister, John Baptist, Gober he overhauled the economy,

196
00:11:54.520 --> 00:11:55.760
building a network of canals,

197
00:11:55.761 --> 00:11:59.160
roads and ports in a handful of years that transformed French life.

198
00:11:59.680 --> 00:12:03.120
Louis was even slightly progressive for his time promoting ministers from the

199
00:12:03.760 --> 00:12:06.840
bourgeois Z at the expense of Nobles, much to these same Nobles horror,

200
00:12:07.020 --> 00:12:08.760
but the sun king would've been respected to death.

201
00:12:08.761 --> 00:12:13.510
If he just spent time building roads and dropping his no

202
00:12:13.511 --> 00:12:17.750
getting to the top of the European Royals in the 17th century meant one thing.

203
00:12:17.810 --> 00:12:20.670
And one thing only meant going to war.

204
00:12:20.970 --> 00:12:23.430
And just before we get into that quick word from our sponsor today,

205
00:12:23.450 --> 00:12:25.470
if you want to look like European mobility,

206
00:12:25.530 --> 00:12:28.110
but don't have the unlimited budget of that group. Well,

207
00:12:28.111 --> 00:12:30.710
let me tell you a little something about today's sponsor in Sarah.

208
00:12:31.090 --> 00:12:33.980
I'm wearing one right now. This is the of iner rogue,

209
00:12:34.200 --> 00:12:37.300
but I've got a couple of others right here, this little table next to me,

210
00:12:37.330 --> 00:12:40.940
this is a chrono S and this is their take on a pilot watch.

211
00:12:41.050 --> 00:12:45.020
They're all great looking stuff for the chrono S they went for a nice blue

212
00:12:45.021 --> 00:12:48.420
background, silver outside the pilot watch black strap,

213
00:12:48.710 --> 00:12:51.140
black back black bezel looking good.

214
00:12:51.250 --> 00:12:55.370
Also this Chronos is actually a 38 minute LA MEA. I've got little risks. So, uh,

215
00:12:55.520 --> 00:12:58.850
they make different watches for different sizes. So look, it's a brand new year,

216
00:12:58.990 --> 00:13:00.210
so why not start it off, right?

217
00:13:00.211 --> 00:13:02.930
Put some confidence in your step with a great looking watch.

218
00:13:03.210 --> 00:13:05.450
I think doing that can really set the pace for a whole year.

219
00:13:05.451 --> 00:13:09.250
And I know it seems kind of like a silly, small thing that, you know, I mean,

220
00:13:09.470 --> 00:13:13.010
in many ways it's just a watch, but it's so much more than that. A watch really,

221
00:13:13.270 --> 00:13:15.640
you know, makes you feel good overall.

222
00:13:16.040 --> 00:13:19.080
And Viera Watchers believe that luxury isn't about price or specification.

223
00:13:19.110 --> 00:13:21.840
It's about detail and craftsmanship and Viera watches.

224
00:13:22.030 --> 00:13:23.080

227
00:13:31.820 --> 00:13:32.840
And let's get back to it.

228
00:13:39.210 --> 00:13:42.350
The issue with going to war is that even in an absolute monarchy,

229
00:13:42.351 --> 00:13:45.470
your subjects tend not to take very kindly to being told,

230
00:13:45.530 --> 00:13:50.070
to die on a battlefield without good reason with the economy expanding France's

231
00:13:50.190 --> 00:13:53.390
minister called bear was eager to swallow up some new territory.

232
00:13:53.780 --> 00:13:57.900
Ideally the Spanish net, what with today called Belgium and Luxemburg.

233
00:13:58.120 --> 00:14:01.500
But while that was a good enough reason for Louie and Cal bear,

234
00:14:01.880 --> 00:14:03.140
it wasn't for the public.

235
00:14:03.480 --> 00:14:07.500
So the sun king set about finding a reason in the mid 1660s,

236
00:14:07.940 --> 00:14:11.100
Louie announced that his marriage to the Spanish Maria to reasona meant the

237
00:14:11.101 --> 00:14:15.140
Spanish Netherlands should for complicated dynastic reasons belonged to him.

238
00:14:15.760 --> 00:14:18.010
Clearly the French king grasping at straws,

239
00:14:18.030 --> 00:14:22.970
but it was also enough in may of 1667. Louis launched the war of devolution,

240
00:14:23.020 --> 00:14:26.450
which should perhaps become known as the unprovoked invasion of Belgium.

241
00:14:27.050 --> 00:14:30.810
Although the French made great gains international pressure from England forced

242
00:14:30.811 --> 00:14:35.330
them to mostly withdraw leaving the Spanish Netherlands in Spanish hands.

243
00:14:35.790 --> 00:14:39.200
But despite this setback, the wall, wasn't a failure for one thing.

244
00:14:39.201 --> 00:14:40.800
The early French victories in the facts,

245
00:14:41.200 --> 00:14:44.560
Louis had withdrawn under diplomatic pressure rather than in the face of great

246
00:14:44.580 --> 00:14:47.720
losses, seriously boosted his popularity for another.

247
00:14:47.780 --> 00:14:49.440
It cemented in many people's minds.

248
00:14:49.460 --> 00:14:54.080
The idea that France had some sort of claim to the Spanish Netherlands. Now,

249
00:14:54.100 --> 00:14:58.240
all Louie had to do was wait until the time was right, and he could try again,

250
00:14:58.430 --> 00:15:01.280
that time came sooner than anyone was expecting.

251
00:15:01.420 --> 00:15:05.760
In 1670 Louis signed a secret treaty with Charles II of England playing on the

252
00:15:05.761 --> 00:15:10.240
facts. They were both Catholics to win over his former arrival. Then in 1672,

253
00:15:10.241 --> 00:15:12.030
he, he launched his re invasion.

254
00:15:12.570 --> 00:15:15.190
The new French attack on the Netherlands was so successful.

255
00:15:15.260 --> 00:15:19.750
It's still known in Dutch history as Raja or the year of disaster.

256
00:15:20.170 --> 00:15:23.870
It didn't help that in 1674, the British joined on Louis' side,

257
00:15:24.020 --> 00:15:28.190
leaving the former Dutch ally out to dry. It wasn't until the Dutch leader,

258
00:15:28.191 --> 00:15:30.470
William of orange married Charles II's niece,

259
00:15:30.471 --> 00:15:34.620
that English and abandoned Louis and the war ended by that time though,

260
00:15:34.940 --> 00:15:38.300
Louis had gotten what he wanted the gains made by the French armies in the

261
00:15:38.301 --> 00:15:43.060
Franco Dutch war effectively created the modern French Belgium border Louise

262
00:15:43.061 --> 00:15:46.580
snatch towns and cities from the Spanish Netherlands that would remain French

263
00:15:46.790 --> 00:15:50.380
until today. Although he hadn't delivered the hammer blow against the Dutch,

264
00:15:50.540 --> 00:15:51.373
he was hoping for,

265
00:15:51.810 --> 00:15:54.650
we returned from the war at the height of his powers in Paris.

266
00:15:54.750 --> 00:15:58.530
He was given the nickname, the great and people lined up to sing his praises.

267
00:15:58.560 --> 00:16:00.130
Finally, it was here.

268
00:16:00.430 --> 00:16:03.890
The Zenni Louis had imagined when he became an absolute Monarch.

269
00:16:03.891 --> 00:16:07.330
Those years ago, the sun king at his noon day height,

270
00:16:07.750 --> 00:16:11.810
but the king had forgotten what happens to the sun after it reaches its highest

271
00:16:12.280 --> 00:16:15.920
point. It always sets Louis. The 14th didn't know it yet,

272
00:16:15.921 --> 00:16:19.400
but the sun of his reign was already dipping towards the horizon.

273
00:16:19.790 --> 00:16:22.400
From here on out. It was gonna be all downhill

274
00:16:28.350 --> 00:16:32.400
From one perspective. The early 1680s should have been a time of triumph.

275
00:16:32.480 --> 00:16:37.390
The Louis in 1682 building work on Versai was finally completed allowing the sun

276
00:16:37.550 --> 00:16:41.230
king to permanently station his court in the most opulent building on earth.

277
00:16:41.460 --> 00:16:44.870
From another perspective, though, the course of the decade had already been set.

278
00:16:45.050 --> 00:16:46.750
Its well was already poisoned.

279
00:16:47.010 --> 00:16:51.830
The trouble started in 1679 that year a police investigation revealed

280
00:16:51.831 --> 00:16:52.631
many members of the,

281
00:16:52.631 --> 00:16:56.340
a stock Christy had been visiting fortune tells and illegal act.

282
00:16:56.370 --> 00:17:00.660
They were also using potions taking part in black mass and trying to poison

283
00:17:00.661 --> 00:17:01.940
their rivals scores.

284
00:17:01.941 --> 00:17:06.060
Upon scores of a size regulars were implicated most damaging for the king.

285
00:17:06.120 --> 00:17:06.861
His mistres,

286
00:17:06.861 --> 00:17:10.620
the Marquita Monte spawn was revealed to have used love potions on him.

287
00:17:10.840 --> 00:17:14.890
The fallout of the affair of the poisons was felt all across French society.

288
00:17:15.230 --> 00:17:19.090
Of course the sunk king changed tack ditching the party lifestyle and imposing

289
00:17:19.091 --> 00:17:23.450
sobriety and Pty on his Nobles and replacing the Marquita Monte spa with the

290
00:17:23.810 --> 00:17:27.050
Seba and PS Madam Zel deman. Of course,

291
00:17:27.051 --> 00:17:29.010
this was just for the eyes of the public behind the scenes.

292
00:17:29.210 --> 00:17:31.770
Everyone kept on gambling, drinking and having affairs,

293
00:17:31.990 --> 00:17:33.810
but it left a nasty taste in the mouth.

294
00:17:34.440 --> 00:17:37.720
One that poisoned the public against France's elites.

295
00:17:37.860 --> 00:17:40.320
But if the affair of the poisons was a catastrophe,

296
00:17:40.560 --> 00:17:44.680
Lou couldn't predict the next disaster. Well that was of his own making way,

297
00:17:44.880 --> 00:17:46.200
way back in 1598,

298
00:17:46.250 --> 00:17:50.920
Henry the fourth had signed the edict of not granting rights to the Protestants

299
00:17:50.940 --> 00:17:54.360
of France known as the Hugos. They numbered around 1 million.

300
00:17:54.550 --> 00:17:57.200
Most of them skilled artisans in the 80 plus years,

301
00:17:57.350 --> 00:17:59.360
sins that integrated into French society.

302
00:17:59.580 --> 00:18:02.120
But when the extremely Catholic Louie looked at them,

303
00:18:02.260 --> 00:18:06.920
he didn't see a group with a valuable skillset. He saw outsiders invaders,

304
00:18:07.280 --> 00:18:09.150
a swarm of for nothings.

305
00:18:09.490 --> 00:18:13.150
So the sun king decided to do something about that in 1685,

306
00:18:13.550 --> 00:18:17.550
Louis revoked the edict of not replacing it with the edict of font and blue

307
00:18:17.710 --> 00:18:22.270
suddenly tolerance was out and persecution of murder was in Hugo churches were

308
00:18:22.271 --> 00:18:23.910
destroyed. Schools were closed.

309
00:18:24.060 --> 00:18:28.350
Protestants were sent into internal exile and those who refused to go were

310
00:18:28.351 --> 00:18:30.860
executed. It was a cruel senseless policy.

311
00:18:31.080 --> 00:18:33.660
It was also a spectacular own goal.

312
00:18:33.880 --> 00:18:38.460
As news of Louis' decree spread outage swept of the Protestant nations refuge

313
00:18:38.560 --> 00:18:43.180
was offered for the Hugos in PRSA and parts of the holy Roman AMBA in England.

314
00:18:43.370 --> 00:18:48.020
It's actually from these fleeing Hugos that English gets the word refugee and

315
00:18:48.021 --> 00:18:52.290
that's not all England of the tens of thousands of refugees that came to

316
00:18:52.291 --> 00:18:55.170
England. Almost all of them carried some vital skill.

317
00:18:55.230 --> 00:18:59.850
France lost so many of its best crafts people that entire industry suffered.

318
00:19:00.000 --> 00:19:03.850
It's thought that today the EDIC to font and blue set sectors of the economy

319
00:19:04.160 --> 00:19:06.610
back decades, but from Louis's perspective,

320
00:19:06.870 --> 00:19:09.610
it had an even worse effect over in the Netherlands.

321
00:19:09.611 --> 00:19:12.840
The protest William of orange was getting jumpy revoking.

322
00:19:12.841 --> 00:19:14.920
The edict of NANS might be a warning sign.

323
00:19:15.320 --> 00:19:17.360
Louis was going to invade again to stop it off.

324
00:19:17.361 --> 00:19:22.200
England had just coronated the stormy Catholic James II without England on side

325
00:19:22.440 --> 00:19:25.400
in any future war William knew the Netherlands was lost.

326
00:19:25.620 --> 00:19:29.440
So he decided to force England onto his side in November 16, 88,

327
00:19:29.441 --> 00:19:33.070
William of orange sets sale at the head of a huge invasion force.

328
00:19:33.370 --> 00:19:36.950
If you ever heard that 10 66 was the last time Britain successfully was

329
00:19:36.951 --> 00:19:37.570
conquered.

330
00:19:37.570 --> 00:19:41.750
That's only because William of Orange's victory was so quick that everyone

331
00:19:41.751 --> 00:19:43.790
forgets it. Within weeks of Williams landing,

332
00:19:44.110 --> 00:19:48.070
a Tobe gems had been captured and the entire country turned pro orange.

333
00:19:48.410 --> 00:19:52.460
The thing is Louis could have almost certainly stopped the glorious revolution

334
00:19:52.640 --> 00:19:53.240
had he done.

335
00:19:53.240 --> 00:19:57.700
So he would've gained a Catholic ally in James II and a chance to crush the

336
00:19:57.701 --> 00:19:58.534
Protestant Dutch,

337
00:19:58.640 --> 00:20:02.420
but Louis was simply too arrogant to believe that God wasn't on his side,

338
00:20:02.421 --> 00:20:05.580
that England's Catholics would an rise up overthrow William.

339
00:20:05.880 --> 00:20:09.060
By the time he realized what a geopolitical screwup had just committed.

340
00:20:09.200 --> 00:20:12.650
It was too late without a drop of blood being else. William and his wife,

341
00:20:12.651 --> 00:20:16.250
Mary were made joints monarchs of Englands in January 16, 89.

342
00:20:16.550 --> 00:20:20.010
And just like that Catholicism in Britain went into terminal decline.

343
00:20:20.310 --> 00:20:24.090
And just like that, Louis fortunes went into terminal decline two

344
00:20:30.390 --> 00:20:34.040
On July, the first 1690, a huge French force gathered in Ireland,

345
00:20:34.340 --> 00:20:37.080
try and restore James II to the English throne.

346
00:20:37.270 --> 00:20:40.760
Instead they were defeated in the bloody bitter battle of the boy,

347
00:20:41.040 --> 00:20:45.000
a Protestant victory that remains hugely controversial in Ireland, but by then,

348
00:20:45.520 --> 00:20:47.120
Louie already had other troubles on his mind.

349
00:20:47.500 --> 00:20:50.920
By 1690 France was embroiled in the war of the grand Alliance.

350
00:20:51.140 --> 00:20:53.400
The war of the grand Alliance also known as the nine years.

351
00:20:53.460 --> 00:20:55.440
War is one of those old timey conflicts.

352
00:20:55.441 --> 00:20:59.040
That's super complicated to explain without us launching a whole new channel

353
00:20:59.130 --> 00:21:04.120
named war graphics to walk us through it all since we don't have time for that,

354
00:21:04.350 --> 00:21:08.790
just know it was in part triggered by the impending death of Karl I second of

355
00:21:08.791 --> 00:21:12.630
Spain, Habsburg Karl was so inbreds that he was incapable of sirening,

356
00:21:12.631 --> 00:21:15.550
an air that man who would rule Spain next was an open question.

357
00:21:15.930 --> 00:21:17.990
So Louie tried to make the answer to that question.

358
00:21:18.290 --> 00:21:22.150
France resulting in a long bloody inconclusive war that only petered out in

359
00:21:22.151 --> 00:21:24.350
1697, Europe was exhausted.

360
00:21:24.830 --> 00:21:28.300
And what was the worst part while everyone was to do it all over again,

361
00:21:28.710 --> 00:21:30.740
three years after the war of the grands Alliance ended,

362
00:21:31.140 --> 00:21:34.620
Karl died for real and Louis declared his own grandson, Philip,

363
00:21:34.800 --> 00:21:36.980
the new king of Spain, to be fair to Louis.

364
00:21:37.240 --> 00:21:40.980
He knew grabbing the Spanish throne would lead to another European meltdown,

365
00:21:41.260 --> 00:21:44.980
but he felt he had no choice. What if one of his enemies grabs it in instead?

366
00:21:45.280 --> 00:21:49.810
So with the heavy heart Louis press dooms day button on leg grand Sierra club,

367
00:21:50.130 --> 00:21:52.410
the 13 years of fighting that followed were blessed.

368
00:21:52.430 --> 00:21:56.970
The great century and more the crappy decade Francis's forces were

369
00:21:56.971 --> 00:21:57.804
decimated.

370
00:21:58.050 --> 00:22:01.130
Territory was lost at the same time that France was suffering on the world

371
00:22:01.180 --> 00:22:05.090
stage, the sun king was suffering in private two as the war progressed,

372
00:22:05.530 --> 00:22:06.770
Louis's son to of his grandsons,

373
00:22:06.890 --> 00:22:11.000
his great grandson and great granddaughter all passed away in public.

374
00:22:11.140 --> 00:22:14.920
The energy of the sun King's early years faded away, replaced by melancholy.

375
00:22:14.921 --> 00:22:19.080
That seemed to turn everything a dull Midwinter, gray remarkably.

376
00:22:19.081 --> 00:22:21.240
This misery actually won Louis public support.

377
00:22:21.500 --> 00:22:25.840
It was said the king was carrying the nation's entire grief in this time of war.

378
00:22:25.870 --> 00:22:29.630
When the war of Spanish succession finally came to a close in 17, 14,

379
00:22:29.850 --> 00:22:34.350
the sun king had almost faded away while a late surge by the French had allowed

380
00:22:34.351 --> 00:22:36.550
them to keep Louis's grandson on the Spanish throne.

381
00:22:36.770 --> 00:22:38.110
It still felt like a failure.

382
00:22:38.550 --> 00:22:40.950
Philip had been excluded from the line of French succession,

383
00:22:40.951 --> 00:22:44.950
meaning Louis's dream of a unified France in Spain could not be realized.

384
00:22:45.210 --> 00:22:48.070
Not that Louis had much longer left to dream. Anyway, Louis,

385
00:22:48.071 --> 00:22:52.220
the 14th felt deathly ill adverse eye in August,

386
00:22:52.220 --> 00:22:53.340
1715 on his deathbed,

387
00:22:53.440 --> 00:22:56.380
the sunk king famously confessed to his surviving great grandson,

388
00:22:56.600 --> 00:23:00.140
the future Louis, the 15th that he had gone to war for vanity's sake.

389
00:23:00.280 --> 00:23:04.260
And as that, his grandson shouldn't be like him. Then with his final breath,

390
00:23:04.320 --> 00:23:09.140
he declared I apart that the state will always remain the sunk king died on

391
00:23:09.300 --> 00:23:11.650
September the first 1715 at the moment,

392
00:23:11.790 --> 00:23:16.370
the sun set on his reign Louis the 14th had been on the throne for 72 years

393
00:23:16.750 --> 00:23:21.370
and 110 days when he first became king, France had been a divided state,

394
00:23:21.390 --> 00:23:25.090
the French monarchy, a secondary power. Now, as dusk finally fell,

395
00:23:25.190 --> 00:23:27.530
it was across a France at the height of its powers.

396
00:23:27.660 --> 00:23:30.760
Paris was the global center of fashion culture.

397
00:23:31.220 --> 00:23:35.320
But if Louis thought in his last moments that the story ended here,

398
00:23:35.900 --> 00:23:38.160
he was wrong over the next 74 years,

399
00:23:38.180 --> 00:23:42.760
the system of government Louis had set up would osify into the anion regime

400
00:23:43.020 --> 00:23:44.120
in 1789.

401
00:23:44.121 --> 00:23:48.160
It was this regime that was overthrown in the greatest European upheaval of all

402
00:23:48.580 --> 00:23:51.640
the French revolution. But that's for another video for now.

403
00:23:51.750 --> 00:23:54.320
It's simply enough for us to bid farewell to Louis the 14th,

404
00:23:54.380 --> 00:23:57.880
to perhaps the greatest French king to have ever lived.

405
00:23:58.100 --> 00:24:01.400
He may have made mistakes. He may have been an autocrat,

406
00:24:01.620 --> 00:24:05.830
but the son King's life is destined to forever sh shine throughout history,

407
00:24:06.510 --> 00:24:11.470
visible even into the far distant future for a king as egotistical as Louis

408
00:24:11.490 --> 00:24:15.110
the 14th. Well, that's exactly what he would've wanted.

409
00:24:15.570 --> 00:24:17.670
So I really hope you found that video. Interesting. If you did,
