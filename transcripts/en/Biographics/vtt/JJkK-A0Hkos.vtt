00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:03.780
<v 0>He was one of the greatest statesman of the 20th century, born a small town,</v>

2
00:00:03.781 --> 00:00:06.570
nobody in the Austrian empire, Tomasz, Garrick masseur.

3
00:00:06.680 --> 00:00:10.950
It can nonetheless wound up rising to the very top of central European politics

4
00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:12.360
and then academic and philosopher.

5
00:00:12.540 --> 00:00:16.650
He made his name defending the rights of the downtrodden from Jews falsely

6
00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:19.650
accused of ritual killings to Slav separatists,

7
00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:23.550
but it would be what he did during world war one that cemented his reputation

8
00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:28.230
part cheque and part Slovak master Rick dead to envision a homelands for both

9
00:00:28.231 --> 00:00:32.130
ethnicities. When the Austro-Hungarian empire disintegrated in 1918,

10
00:00:32.310 --> 00:00:36.090
it was from his blueprints that Czechoslovakia was born. Yes,

11
00:00:36.091 --> 00:00:39.690
master Rick was more than just the founder of the Czech and Slovak Republic.

12
00:00:39.990 --> 00:00:41.940
It's first and longest serving presidents.

13
00:00:42.230 --> 00:00:46.020
He helped steer this brand new nation through one of the darkest times in modern

14
00:00:46.021 --> 00:00:50.520
history. Leading by example, he tried to create a liberal, rational democracy,

15
00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:55.380
amid a sea of dictatorships only to live long enough to see his homelands begin

16
00:00:55.381 --> 00:00:58.830
to crumble before the awesome mite of Nazi Germany,

17
00:00:58.860 --> 00:01:02.670
both their European George Washington and the modern day philosopher King.

18
00:01:02.880 --> 00:01:07.080
This is the story of Tomas Masaryk the father of Czechoslovak.

19
00:01:07.490 --> 00:01:08.323
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

20
00:01:19.910 --> 00:01:21.830
<v 0>Cool. March day. When on massive,</v>

21
00:01:22.030 --> 00:01:26.030
Eric was born in 1850 outside of modern day Hodan in,

22
00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:27.080
in the Czech Republic,

23
00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:30.740
both the dad was anything remotely like the Czech Republic in existence.

24
00:01:30.741 --> 00:01:32.690
Back then in the mid 19th century,

25
00:01:32.691 --> 00:01:36.290
central Europe was dominated by the Austrian empire. Under the Habsburgs.

26
00:01:36.291 --> 00:01:40.490
The monarchy had ruled all checks speaking lands for centuries until recently

27
00:01:40.550 --> 00:01:45.110
this has just been the way things were. But two years before master X Beth,

28
00:01:45.140 --> 00:01:48.410
something that happens that would profoundly shape the course of his life.

29
00:01:48.530 --> 00:01:53.180
1848 had been Europe's year of revolution across the continents. off.

30
00:01:53.181 --> 00:01:57.290
Liberals had risen up against Kings and Amber is igniting political fires from

31
00:01:57.291 --> 00:02:01.130
France to Prussia. It's a hungry in Bohemia, the Czech historian,

32
00:02:01.131 --> 00:02:02.990
friends of Shaq Polaski, the ghouls,

33
00:02:02.991 --> 00:02:07.940
a revolutionary Slavic Congress determines to win autonomy for all Slavs in

34
00:02:07.941 --> 00:02:08.870
the Austrian. And Bob,

35
00:02:08.930 --> 00:02:13.460
unfortunately the Austrians had responded by bobbing Prague to bits and well

36
00:02:13.910 --> 00:02:18.770
that's had been that almost the truth was once nationalism was out of its box.

37
00:02:18.770 --> 00:02:23.480
Once those check dreams had been given form, it was impossible to put back in.

38
00:02:23.540 --> 00:02:25.160
It would take another seven decades,

39
00:02:25.161 --> 00:02:30.140
but the hopes of the 1848 revolutionaries would have one day be fulfilled and

40
00:02:30.141 --> 00:02:32.270
it would be all thanks to Thomas.

41
00:02:32.300 --> 00:02:35.990
Masaryk not that there was anything in his child to do indicate the boy would

42
00:02:35.991 --> 00:02:37.260
grow up to be so important.

43
00:02:37.310 --> 00:02:41.420
Master his father was a salt of the earth Slovak Coachman working on an Imperial

44
00:02:41.421 --> 00:02:42.254
estate. Well,

45
00:02:42.350 --> 00:02:45.590
his check mother had a simulators with the dominant Austrian culture.

46
00:02:45.680 --> 00:02:48.680
The family were also relatively poor enough. So the master,

47
00:02:48.860 --> 00:02:52.070
his parents felt they couldn't afford to send their son to secondary education.

48
00:02:52.340 --> 00:02:55.730
It was only thanks to outside intervention that master Derek didn't spend the

49
00:02:55.731 --> 00:02:59.030
rest of his life in obscurity from the earliest stage.

50
00:02:59.110 --> 00:03:01.960
Boy had been a prodigious devour of books.

51
00:03:02.050 --> 00:03:04.540
Like if books were a breakfast buffet,

52
00:03:05.170 --> 00:03:07.480
master Rick would be the huge American in cargo shorts.

53
00:03:07.480 --> 00:03:11.080
Going back for 17th servings of bacon, he had read everything.

54
00:03:11.081 --> 00:03:14.920
He could get his hands on retaining knowledge on hyper obscure subjects.

55
00:03:15.010 --> 00:03:17.950
Eventually the Dean of the local school couldn't take it any longer.

56
00:03:17.951 --> 00:03:22.570
And he went to Mr and Mrs. Masaryk and basically said, guys, I know you're poor,

57
00:03:22.690 --> 00:03:26.710
but you have to give this boy an education. And so it was that young master,

58
00:03:26.890 --> 00:03:29.020
Eric found himself ditching his local locksmith,

59
00:03:29.021 --> 00:03:32.920
apprenticeship and enrolling in Bruno's Catholic grammar school.

60
00:03:33.190 --> 00:03:37.270
The move was a lifesaver at school Masaryk approved. So adept,

61
00:03:37.271 --> 00:03:40.550
he won a scholarship. However, this still wasn't enough to fund his studies.

62
00:03:40.551 --> 00:03:43.890
So he took up tutoring work for the family of Amazon Lemonnier.

63
00:03:43.930 --> 00:03:48.820
The director of the police. This would turn out to be extremely lucky in 1868,

64
00:03:48.850 --> 00:03:52.930
the Catholic raised masseur extorted, refusing confession, not a big deal.

65
00:03:52.931 --> 00:03:55.270
You might think, but the grammar school considered it.

66
00:03:55.270 --> 00:03:58.420
A requirement's when master at kept refusing, they kicked him out.

67
00:03:58.450 --> 00:04:02.290
And just as long as Nash master X time and education could have been over,

68
00:04:02.380 --> 00:04:06.320
had it not been for Lemonnier when the policemen found out about the suspension

69
00:04:06.400 --> 00:04:09.850
and he was pretty much like that's a bit weird. I'm about to move to Vienna,

70
00:04:09.851 --> 00:04:13.450
to become a super important police guy. How about you come with me?

71
00:04:13.540 --> 00:04:15.100
And that's how in 1869,

72
00:04:15.310 --> 00:04:19.510
Tom Masaryk found himself living in the Imperial capital life. Wasn't easy.

73
00:04:19.540 --> 00:04:21.670
Even with Lemonnier as a patron master,

74
00:04:21.671 --> 00:04:25.510
Rick worked his Priddle off tutoring the family and passing his exams,

75
00:04:25.511 --> 00:04:30.280
but pass them. He did enrolling in 1872 at Vienna's philosophical faculty.

76
00:04:30.550 --> 00:04:34.030
This was a huge step for the son of a semi-literate Slovak Coachman,

77
00:04:34.390 --> 00:04:37.120
but it almost all fell apart in 1873,

78
00:04:37.121 --> 00:04:40.810
Lemonnier died and Masaryk was suddenly without a guardian angel.

79
00:04:40.990 --> 00:04:44.740
It was only through sheer luck that he managed to find another wealthy family to

80
00:04:44.741 --> 00:04:48.910
take him in and keep our video from fizzling out right here.

81
00:04:49.060 --> 00:04:51.790
Finally in 1876, mastering graduated.

82
00:04:51.910 --> 00:04:54.160
He moved to Leipzig hoping to do some studying,

83
00:04:54.280 --> 00:04:56.830
but it wouldn't be books that occupied his mind.

84
00:04:56.920 --> 00:05:00.460
It was in Germany that Masaryk met the woman who had changes.

85
00:05:07.500 --> 00:05:10.860
It's compile a list of the most intense periods of master ex life.

86
00:05:11.010 --> 00:05:15.630
The summer of 1877 would certainly have to make the top three that's because

87
00:05:15.631 --> 00:05:18.630
over the space of just two months in Leipzig master Rick met,

88
00:05:18.810 --> 00:05:22.200
fell in love with and got to engage the women that he'd be with for the rest of

89
00:05:22.201 --> 00:05:25.980
his life. Shola Garrick was a wealthy expatriate from New York.

90
00:05:26.160 --> 00:05:30.600
Who's determined. Progressivism was like a grenade dropped into stuffy,

91
00:05:30.630 --> 00:05:33.180
central Europe, a philosopher and feminist. She,

92
00:05:33.181 --> 00:05:35.760
and Masaryk bonded over a love of John Stuart mill,

93
00:05:35.761 --> 00:05:38.880
particularly his landmark essay on the subjugation of women.

94
00:05:39.180 --> 00:05:41.010
You know how you occasionally meet someone.

95
00:05:41.011 --> 00:05:45.420
You feel like you can talk about anything with a person who just gets you well.

96
00:05:45.450 --> 00:05:47.340
That was master Eric and Garrick.

97
00:05:47.370 --> 00:05:50.910
When master Rick Olsen managed to save Garrick from drowning during a river

98
00:05:50.911 --> 00:05:55.650
trip, it was just the sexy icing on the cake of love. And yes,

99
00:05:55.651 --> 00:05:59.210
you can be certain there's. I'm going to use that particular metaphor again,

100
00:05:59.630 --> 00:06:02.990
engaged shortly after the original plan was for both of them go back to their

101
00:06:02.991 --> 00:06:05.270
respective homes. So master, I could find a job,

102
00:06:05.450 --> 00:06:07.460
but when Garrick was taken ill in America,

103
00:06:07.820 --> 00:06:09.890
massive wreck abandoned Vienna to be by her side,

104
00:06:09.980 --> 00:06:13.520
the two married in New York city on March the 15th, 1878,

105
00:06:13.610 --> 00:06:17.210
the early bum note was master at commencing the full power of asking his new

106
00:06:17.211 --> 00:06:18.500
father-in-law for money,

107
00:06:18.710 --> 00:06:22.490
which went over about as well as calling him a stupid yang and kicking him in

108
00:06:22.491 --> 00:06:23.270
the balls.

109
00:06:23.270 --> 00:06:27.620
But when it became clear that master Rick was literally broke dad consented to

110
00:06:27.621 --> 00:06:29.750
keep the new family afloat finances,

111
00:06:29.780 --> 00:06:32.180
semi secure master Rick and Sean had returned to Europe,

112
00:06:32.480 --> 00:06:36.260
but it was three solid years of awkward handouts from dad until Masaryk finally

113
00:06:36.261 --> 00:06:38.360
landed a professorship at Prague university.

114
00:06:38.600 --> 00:06:41.870
The family moved to the great Bahamian city in 1882,

115
00:06:42.080 --> 00:06:46.280
just as everything was changing, the romantic nationalism of 1848,

116
00:06:46.310 --> 00:06:47.720
hadn't gone away in Prague.

117
00:06:47.780 --> 00:06:50.930
Instead as more checks flooded in from the surrounding countryside,

118
00:06:51.290 --> 00:06:52.610
it had reached a fever pitch.

119
00:06:52.790 --> 00:06:56.870
Masaryk joins the university just as it was being divided into separate checking

120
00:06:56.871 --> 00:07:00.230
German institutes. While he did get swept up in the wave of feeling,

121
00:07:00.231 --> 00:07:03.830
writing a treatise on Mr. 1848 himself to shack Polanski.

122
00:07:04.040 --> 00:07:07.160
He wasn't some mindless nationalist in the 1880s.

123
00:07:07.190 --> 00:07:11.810
A key pillar of the Czech revival was a pair of recently rediscovered Epic poems

124
00:07:11.811 --> 00:07:14.360
from the medieval era written in old check,

125
00:07:14.920 --> 00:07:17.720
considered the Bohemian equivalent of the German NEBA Longin lied.

126
00:07:17.780 --> 00:07:20.150
They were a source of intense national pride.

127
00:07:20.390 --> 00:07:24.170
They were also as fake as Dr. Damage of George Washington taking part in

128
00:07:24.171 --> 00:07:28.070
WrestleMania, something massive. Rick proved with some Def literary analysis.

129
00:07:28.130 --> 00:07:30.680
Naturally all the Czech nationalists hated him.

130
00:07:30.830 --> 00:07:34.880
It's here that we see one of the most admirable things about mass Rick.

131
00:07:34.970 --> 00:07:36.950
Although we had his own romantic ideals,

132
00:07:37.070 --> 00:07:41.750
he was a man who believed first and foremost in being rigorous in his beliefs,

133
00:07:41.780 --> 00:07:45.110
even when it made him unpopular. As he supposedly once said,

134
00:07:45.380 --> 00:07:48.590
the glory of a nation cannot be built on counterfeits,

135
00:07:48.650 --> 00:07:52.370
nor is this the only example of master egg being willing to swim against the

136
00:07:52.371 --> 00:07:54.470
tide is later in 1899,

137
00:07:54.471 --> 00:07:59.100
he would publicly agitate for the retrial of Leopold Hills near a Jewish man

138
00:07:59.120 --> 00:08:01.940
convicted on non-existence evidence of ritual murder.

139
00:08:02.180 --> 00:08:05.300
At this time anti-Semitism was rife among Czech nationalists.

140
00:08:05.360 --> 00:08:07.670
When master Rick came out on Hills and aside,

141
00:08:07.671 --> 00:08:11.660
he was pelted with stones and spat on in the street at the university

142
00:08:12.220 --> 00:08:15.380
nationalist check students hounded him until he was forced to go on unpaid

143
00:08:15.381 --> 00:08:19.220
extended leave. It was a high price to pay for his commitment to rationality,

144
00:08:19.430 --> 00:08:21.920
but it did have one unexpected good side.

145
00:08:22.040 --> 00:08:24.950
It would be weathering these storms that gave massive brick,

146
00:08:24.951 --> 00:08:28.580
the steel backbone that it need to soon change the world.

147
00:08:34.930 --> 00:08:35.380
<v 1>[Inaudible].</v>

148
00:08:35.380 --> 00:08:38.650
<v 0>One of his periodic controversies that master rig began to turn away from</v>

149
00:08:38.651 --> 00:08:42.040
academia and towards politics. He began writing articles,

150
00:08:42.041 --> 00:08:46.930
agitating for a revival of the dreams of 1848 dreams focused on winning check

151
00:08:46.931 --> 00:08:50.500
autonomy within Austria, Hungary. Not that he only focused on checks.

152
00:08:50.530 --> 00:08:53.710
One of the sharpest articles was a demolition of how the Hungarian,

153
00:08:53.950 --> 00:08:57.330
half of the empire treated Slovak by North Jersey in no time at all.

154
00:08:57.700 --> 00:09:00.360
Master had established himself as a heavyweight check think up.

155
00:09:00.390 --> 00:09:02.220
So when the liberal young checkbox,

156
00:09:02.310 --> 00:09:06.210
he approached him about running in 1991 elections, it seemed like a no brainer.

157
00:09:06.840 --> 00:09:10.470
Masaryk took them up and was duly elected and found himself back in Vienna for

158
00:09:10.471 --> 00:09:11.790
the first time in years,

159
00:09:11.880 --> 00:09:15.360
what he saw that didn't fit him with confidence in Austria, his Reich's rats,

160
00:09:15.390 --> 00:09:18.960
the young shacks hopped on a course of uncritical nationalism,

161
00:09:19.110 --> 00:09:23.250
unwilling to work within the system so much as just shouted it in 1893,

162
00:09:23.700 --> 00:09:24.720
it quit in disgust.

163
00:09:24.720 --> 00:09:28.650
Certain there's a lack of realism was what was keeping the checks from making

164
00:09:28.651 --> 00:09:30.690
any advances for the next couple of years,

165
00:09:30.691 --> 00:09:33.480
he hung around the edges of the Prague political scene,

166
00:09:33.660 --> 00:09:37.200
writing books and churning out articles by 1900 though,

167
00:09:37.380 --> 00:09:41.340
he decided to put his money where his mouth was that yet master Rick founded his

168
00:09:41.341 --> 00:09:45.720
own realist party with the aim of achieving check autonomy in as the name might

169
00:09:45.721 --> 00:09:49.530
imply a realistic way. Although the party wasn't a bust,

170
00:09:49.531 --> 00:09:54.120
it also wasn't a major success or Marsh in 2017.

171
00:09:54.540 --> 00:09:55.620
This was not,

172
00:09:55.770 --> 00:09:59.820
although it's succeeded in returning master acts at the ride strats in 1907,

173
00:09:59.940 --> 00:10:03.660
it was a minor force at best one, among many check parties.

174
00:10:03.750 --> 00:10:07.410
It probably didn't help that the nationalists still couldn't agree on what they

175
00:10:07.411 --> 00:10:08.010
wanted.

176
00:10:08.010 --> 00:10:12.030
Did they want an autonomous province within Austria or a wholly independent

177
00:10:12.031 --> 00:10:12.690
state,

178
00:10:12.690 --> 00:10:16.380
but while master Eric was firmly in the autonomy camp align was soon going to

179
00:10:16.381 --> 00:10:20.130
change master X transformation from realist to well changing.

180
00:10:20.160 --> 00:10:24.480
Visionary began on the 28th of June, 1914 that day,

181
00:10:24.510 --> 00:10:27.870
the radical Bosnian Serbs assassinated the add to the Austrian throne,

182
00:10:27.871 --> 00:10:31.290
triggering a series of crises that quickly led to the gigantic crisis.

183
00:10:31.291 --> 00:10:33.850
That was world war one for years master,

184
00:10:33.990 --> 00:10:38.010
it had been condemning both Austria's meddling in the Balkans and its Alliance

185
00:10:38.011 --> 00:10:38.790
with Germany.

186
00:10:38.790 --> 00:10:43.320
Now he watched in horror as both of these things dragged the entire continent

187
00:10:43.500 --> 00:10:47.250
toward unprecedented bloodshed by Christmas master,

188
00:10:47.360 --> 00:10:51.150
Rick had had enough now convinced of the need for a separate check nation.

189
00:10:51.390 --> 00:10:56.040
He had it off and to voluntary exile that the ancient cities of Europe on fire

190
00:10:56.550 --> 00:10:59.850
master record began a PR drive designed to make the allies recognized,

191
00:11:00.090 --> 00:11:02.880
check independence. It was an insane task master.

192
00:11:03.030 --> 00:11:06.570
Eric had friends in academia across the worlds, but he wasn't exactly famous.

193
00:11:06.630 --> 00:11:08.760
He was master of the lonely guy,

194
00:11:08.761 --> 00:11:13.350
timidly knocking at the doors of power with a pretty crazy request. Well,

195
00:11:13.351 --> 00:11:16.920
maybe lonely is a bit unfair in 1915 while in France,

196
00:11:16.921 --> 00:11:21.330
Masaryk was joined by another future president of Czechoslovakia at VOD

197
00:11:22.020 --> 00:11:24.780
Benish together bands with the help of master ex literary friends,

198
00:11:24.781 --> 00:11:28.290
they managed to get themselves before the online leaders long enough to be

199
00:11:28.291 --> 00:11:31.680
officially recognized as the check liberation movement.

200
00:11:31.770 --> 00:11:35.310
It was an important first step and acknowledgements that they weren't just two

201
00:11:35.311 --> 00:11:39.270
random dudes fussing about Europe, but guys with a proper,

202
00:11:39.600 --> 00:11:41.280
if minor role now,

203
00:11:41.281 --> 00:11:45.720
all they had to do was turn that minor role into the liberation of their entire

204
00:11:45.721 --> 00:11:47.610
country. How hard could that be?

205
00:11:53.960 --> 00:11:55.060
<v 1>[Inaudible] the next few years.</v>

206
00:11:55.590 --> 00:11:59.010
<v 0>Now like a globe trotting thriller master rig moved across Europe,</v>

207
00:11:59.050 --> 00:12:01.380
bouncing from France to Brisbane, to Russia,

208
00:12:01.410 --> 00:12:05.850
always agitating for Czech and Slovak unity in a new state. Yup.

209
00:12:05.910 --> 00:12:08.040
Czech and Slovak in 1915,

210
00:12:08.580 --> 00:12:12.960
XLS from both communities had started making plans for a Federation and master

211
00:12:13.140 --> 00:12:16.110
Rick had picked up that ball and just run with it.

212
00:12:16.380 --> 00:12:18.180
And it was really running massive.

213
00:12:18.330 --> 00:12:22.020
Rick was convinced Austrian agents were trying to assassinate him as he hopped

214
00:12:22.021 --> 00:12:26.250
around Europe. And he even told Ben Ash to use his death for propaganda.

215
00:12:26.280 --> 00:12:29.940
Should he be killed? Speaking of propaganda, master Rick was a deft handed it,

216
00:12:30.120 --> 00:12:33.990
making sure article's sympathetic to the check cause appear daily in allied

217
00:12:33.991 --> 00:12:36.690
newspapers. When the saw was overthrown in 1917,

218
00:12:36.691 --> 00:12:40.950
even traveled to Russia to organize former Czech and Slovak POW's into a theist

219
00:12:40.980 --> 00:12:41.790
fighting unit.

220
00:12:41.790 --> 00:12:46.320
These Czechoslovak Legionnaires would run remnants in Russia for years at one

221
00:12:46.321 --> 00:12:48.900
point even controlling the Trans-Siberian railway.

222
00:12:49.020 --> 00:12:51.630
And so it went massive zooming around the globe,

223
00:12:51.660 --> 00:12:56.220
shoring up support for Czechoslovak independence with each new destination.

224
00:12:56.430 --> 00:13:01.320
His fame grew with each new PR stunts, a few more came over to his cause,

225
00:13:01.500 --> 00:13:04.650
but it would be in the U S that master Eric, Matt,

226
00:13:05.040 --> 00:13:09.540
his greatest convert Woodrow Wilson was almost the perfect match for master X

227
00:13:10.200 --> 00:13:13.140
left-leaning independence minded politics at the head of America's Jack and

228
00:13:13.530 --> 00:13:16.830
Slovak. Group's master it compressed his goals onto the 28 presidents.

229
00:13:16.831 --> 00:13:21.480
And it clearly works on January the eighth, 1918 Wilson listed his 14 points,

230
00:13:21.481 --> 00:13:24.480
including the complete dismemberment of Austria Hungary.

231
00:13:24.720 --> 00:13:25.710
A couple of months later,

232
00:13:25.740 --> 00:13:29.880
the Lansing declaration explicitly gave us backing to an independent

233
00:13:29.881 --> 00:13:31.350
Czechoslovakia from Iran.

234
00:13:31.680 --> 00:13:36.330
Aus events took on an air of inevitability in may master recognize with

235
00:13:36.331 --> 00:13:38.370
Slovak representatives in Pittsburgh,

236
00:13:38.371 --> 00:13:42.690
where the two sides struck and agreements on Slovak autonomy within the new

237
00:13:43.230 --> 00:13:43.801
state in June,

238
00:13:43.801 --> 00:13:48.210
the allies declared the still non-existent Czechoslovakia and allies power and

239
00:13:48.240 --> 00:13:50.430
recognize the borders proposed by massive wreck.

240
00:13:50.580 --> 00:13:55.050
But despite the feeling in the app was nothing inevitable about any of this

241
00:13:55.230 --> 00:13:59.730
historical events feel inevitable because we're looking back on them as if they

242
00:13:59.731 --> 00:14:02.640
were as unchangeable then as they are now.

243
00:14:02.670 --> 00:14:05.790
But the reality is that none of this was set. Austria.

244
00:14:05.791 --> 00:14:08.250
Hungary could have easily survived the war in tags,

245
00:14:08.400 --> 00:14:11.790
or maybe the chat glands of Bohemia and Moravia could have broken off,

246
00:14:11.820 --> 00:14:15.240
but left the Slovak. So persecuted minority in Hungary,

247
00:14:15.450 --> 00:14:19.230
the fact cause of Akea ever existed is down almost entirely.

248
00:14:19.380 --> 00:14:23.400
It's a master ex tireless work. Finally on October the 28th of 1918,

249
00:14:23.550 --> 00:14:28.260
this new nation officially broke off from the collapsing empire by now massive

250
00:14:28.530 --> 00:14:28.650
breakage.

251
00:14:28.650 --> 00:14:31.830
It's already been named president of the interim governments and hastily made

252
00:14:31.831 --> 00:14:33.270
arrangements to our sands of Prague.

253
00:14:33.570 --> 00:14:37.500
His original plan was to meet in a cafe with some old friends and celebrate.

254
00:14:37.710 --> 00:14:39.960
<v 1>The new Republic bus. As he got closer.</v>

255
00:14:39.960 --> 00:14:43.920
<v 0>To Europe, it became clear that he wasn't returning to his cozy old life.</v>

256
00:14:44.310 --> 00:14:48.540
Wasn't even returning as TG. Masaryk the new interim presidents.

257
00:14:48.600 --> 00:14:53.360
He was returning as the father of an entire nation on December the 21st

258
00:14:53.720 --> 00:14:57.410
master, Rick arrived to vast crowds, desperate to catch a glimpse of him.

259
00:14:57.680 --> 00:15:00.800
The next day, he stood at Prague causal and proudly declared.

260
00:15:01.100 --> 00:15:05.450
The affairs of your governments are returned into your hands once more, Oh,

261
00:15:05.480 --> 00:15:08.090
check people and therein lay the problem.

262
00:15:08.660 --> 00:15:11.360
Massive Rick may have left Prague Czech nationalists,

263
00:15:11.390 --> 00:15:15.950
but had returned leader of a country in which checks just barely made up a

264
00:15:15.951 --> 00:15:19.640
majority in this brave new land. A sixth of the population was Slovak.

265
00:15:19.641 --> 00:15:21.170
Almost a quarter were German.

266
00:15:21.171 --> 00:15:25.400
And there were significant minorities of Hungarians poles and resilience.

267
00:15:25.520 --> 00:15:27.920
If master Rick wanted to make Czechoslovakia work,

268
00:15:28.040 --> 00:15:31.670
he was going to have to convince all these wildly different groups that the

269
00:15:32.090 --> 00:15:36.110
government spoke for them. Spoiler that here, it never quite succeeded.

270
00:15:42.730 --> 00:15:43.563
<v 1>The seeds.</v>

271
00:15:43.840 --> 00:15:48.400
<v 0>He is undoing was sown almost the moment it was created in February, 1920,</v>

272
00:15:48.401 --> 00:15:52.180
a constitutional assembly was called to determine the shape of this new state,

273
00:15:52.210 --> 00:15:56.260
but only Czechs and Slovaks were invited that left a third of the nation

274
00:15:56.270 --> 00:15:57.700
citizens without a say,

275
00:15:57.701 --> 00:16:01.330
and that country would be run where the Germans work in Sans.

276
00:16:01.331 --> 00:16:03.610
This would soon turn out to be a massive problem.

277
00:16:03.730 --> 00:16:07.750
We did a whole video on the Sudeten Germans over on the geographics channel.

278
00:16:07.751 --> 00:16:09.160
If you want to learn more about that.

279
00:16:09.161 --> 00:16:13.180
But the basic version is that Germans had been living in Bohemia and Moravia for

280
00:16:13.181 --> 00:16:14.770
centuries as an ethnic group.

281
00:16:14.800 --> 00:16:18.730
They were far more numerous than the Slovaks and had no interest in taking part

282
00:16:18.731 --> 00:16:21.910
in a stage run specifically for their Slavic neighbors. No,

283
00:16:21.911 --> 00:16:26.350
they wanted the same freedoms mastery had fought for and won from the Austrians,

284
00:16:26.440 --> 00:16:29.590
the right to succeed and to control their own destiny.

285
00:16:29.770 --> 00:16:33.370
But now that the shoe was on the other foot master, it was suddenly all like,

286
00:16:33.910 --> 00:16:37.600
no. And nor was it just the Germans who were unhappy in America,

287
00:16:37.601 --> 00:16:41.260
master Rick promised the Slovak something akin to home rule. Indeed.

288
00:16:41.290 --> 00:16:44.680
He personally envisioned a Swiss star system with each group,

289
00:16:44.710 --> 00:16:46.420
basically left to do their own thing.

290
00:16:46.450 --> 00:16:50.380
But the reality of leading a brand new unstable state soon destroyed this

291
00:16:50.381 --> 00:16:54.940
idealism as the 1920s grabbed onwards Paolo was centralized more and more in

292
00:16:55.420 --> 00:16:58.300
Prague as more and more in the hands of Masaryk.

293
00:16:58.390 --> 00:17:01.180
Although he wielded no formal power as president master,

294
00:17:01.330 --> 00:17:02.620
Rick had a big enough reputation,

295
00:17:02.920 --> 00:17:07.600
enough charming enough allies in politics and the media to get his way on

296
00:17:07.601 --> 00:17:08.830
almost every issue.

297
00:17:08.920 --> 00:17:12.310
There is always something known as castle politics with a small clique centered

298
00:17:12.311 --> 00:17:15.340
around Masaryk effectively ruling outside parliament,

299
00:17:15.430 --> 00:17:19.360
no matter how often Masaryk made speeches promising a federal system in the

300
00:17:19.361 --> 00:17:20.140
future.

301
00:17:20.140 --> 00:17:24.970
The reality was that Czechoslovakia was becoming a highly centralized oligarchy.

302
00:17:25.000 --> 00:17:28.360
Yes, if it was really an oligarchy, it was a fundamentally liberal one,

303
00:17:28.570 --> 00:17:29.920
a diehard liberal at heart.

304
00:17:30.490 --> 00:17:33.820
Masaryk genuinely believed in respecting the rights of all of his subjects,

305
00:17:33.821 --> 00:17:37.540
even separatists like the sea date and Germans or Hungarians,

306
00:17:37.570 --> 00:17:40.630
the constitution guaranteed their freedom of speech, language, worship,

307
00:17:40.631 --> 00:17:44.500
and assembly, a repressive place. This certainly wasn't master.

308
00:17:44.650 --> 00:17:48.340
Rick also went out of his way to try and modify the unhappier ethnicities and

309
00:17:48.341 --> 00:17:52.950
1925 with Germany to recognize one another's borders as legitimate when it's a

310
00:17:52.951 --> 00:17:56.820
long way towards getting the Sudeten Germans on site. In fact,

311
00:17:56.821 --> 00:18:01.080
by the time Masaryk was reelected in 1927, that was good reason to be hopeful.

312
00:18:01.140 --> 00:18:02.160
The economy was booming.

313
00:18:02.161 --> 00:18:05.610
A massive road and rail building plan was keeping people in workings.

314
00:18:05.820 --> 00:18:09.600
A treaty had been reached with France to offer the Republic a security guarantee

315
00:18:09.750 --> 00:18:11.430
on the 10th anniversary of Czechoslovakia.

316
00:18:11.520 --> 00:18:14.640
His foundation master even felt comfortable enough to declare.

317
00:18:14.730 --> 00:18:19.560
We began with empty hands without an army without constitutional traditions,

318
00:18:19.710 --> 00:18:23.970
with a rapidly failing currency in the midst of economic chaos.

319
00:18:24.060 --> 00:18:27.810
And yet we have stood the test and acquitted ourselves with honor.

320
00:18:27.960 --> 00:18:31.470
There was an optimism in the app, a feeling that things were bumpy now,

321
00:18:31.620 --> 00:18:36.540
but with time and a little luck that smoothed out and Czechoslovakia would take

322
00:18:36.541 --> 00:18:40.350
its rightful place among the great democracies. Unfortunately,

323
00:18:40.470 --> 00:18:44.580
time and luck were both things in short supply in 1928,

324
00:18:44.760 --> 00:18:47.100
master X suffered a massive heart attack.

325
00:18:47.190 --> 00:18:50.250
Although he survived the shock to his system, left him a physical wreck,

326
00:18:50.520 --> 00:18:51.690
weak and broken.

327
00:18:51.840 --> 00:18:54.840
It was the perfect metaphor for what was about to happen to both Czechoslovakia

328
00:18:55.230 --> 00:18:58.200
and the entire world. As the end of the decade, came into view.

329
00:18:58.260 --> 00:19:02.580
A massive shock was approaching one that would leave central Europe desperately

330
00:19:02.581 --> 00:19:05.490
sick. It was a sickness, a terrible poison,

331
00:19:05.491 --> 00:19:09.360
a sickness called fascism that would finally kill masseur Axiom.

332
00:19:09.950 --> 00:19:10.783
<v 1>Country.</v>

333
00:19:16.910 --> 00:19:17.470
<v 0>29Th,</v>

334
00:19:17.470 --> 00:19:21.980
1929 wall street fell to earth with a crash heard around the globe.

335
00:19:22.070 --> 00:19:23.570
It was the start of the great depression,

336
00:19:23.571 --> 00:19:28.460
a decade of misery unemployment and endless gnawing hunger in Czechoslovakia.

337
00:19:28.461 --> 00:19:32.930
It blew through industrial cities like a bitter wind shuttering towns

338
00:19:33.110 --> 00:19:35.780
leaving millions destitute. Unfortunately,

339
00:19:35.781 --> 00:19:39.470
most of the worst cities were in the sedate and lands as Prague launched a

340
00:19:39.471 --> 00:19:40.460
modest relief program.

341
00:19:40.550 --> 00:19:43.190
The sedate in Germans watched as their livelihoods were destroyed.

342
00:19:43.340 --> 00:19:46.220
Undoubtedly Jackson Slovak suffered in the depression,

343
00:19:46.550 --> 00:19:48.170
but reality isn't what matters.

344
00:19:48.260 --> 00:19:52.880
What matters is that the German minority began to feel like [inaudible] didn't

345
00:19:52.881 --> 00:19:53.720
care about them.

346
00:19:53.900 --> 00:19:58.250
The Prague was looking out only for Slavs and leaving the Germans to suffer.

347
00:19:58.400 --> 00:20:01.610
So when a silly little man with a funny mustache to power in Germany,

348
00:20:01.611 --> 00:20:05.090
proper promising to make the Germans great again. Well, it,

349
00:20:05.091 --> 00:20:09.980
isn't hard to see how the Sudeten Germans dreams of succession might come

350
00:20:09.981 --> 00:20:14.150
roaring back the rise of the Sudeten and fascist party under hit the fan. Boy,

351
00:20:14.170 --> 00:20:18.560
Conrad handline coincided with a deterioration in master X health.

352
00:20:18.710 --> 00:20:20.840
Although he was reelected again in 1934,

353
00:20:20.870 --> 00:20:23.510
it was mainly because no other viable candidates existed.

354
00:20:23.810 --> 00:20:27.410
Mastery could succeeded in identifying himself with the state so much that

355
00:20:27.411 --> 00:20:31.730
nobody could conceive of a time without him, but that time was almost upon them.

356
00:20:31.880 --> 00:20:33.050
In may of 1935,

357
00:20:33.051 --> 00:20:37.940
parliamentary elections returned 44 seats for headlines fascists, a single seat,

358
00:20:37.941 --> 00:20:42.200
less than the largest party with over two thirds of all sedation Germans.

359
00:20:42.201 --> 00:20:44.240
Now backing a succession as party.

360
00:20:44.480 --> 00:20:48.220
It was clear Czechoslovakia wasn't going hold together much longer.

361
00:20:48.670 --> 00:20:51.880
Masseur X though, wouldn't live to see the better ends on December the 14th,

362
00:20:51.910 --> 00:20:56.650
1935 master Rick abruptly resigned passing the presidency to his old buddy

363
00:20:57.040 --> 00:20:57.970
at VOD banish.

364
00:20:58.210 --> 00:21:01.960
Then the father of the nation slipped away into retirement to wait the

365
00:21:01.961 --> 00:21:03.610
inevitable for nearly two more years,

366
00:21:03.611 --> 00:21:07.030
master at clung to life clung on just as Czechoslovakia did,

367
00:21:07.031 --> 00:21:09.190
even as the sickness grew inside it.

368
00:21:09.400 --> 00:21:12.910
So many people who came to inquire about his health assistant started hanging

369
00:21:12.911 --> 00:21:15.880
posters on the gate every morning, giving updates on the situation.

370
00:21:16.030 --> 00:21:17.620
Finally on September the 14th,

371
00:21:17.621 --> 00:21:22.600
1937 came the poster baring the worst updatable DG masseur

372
00:21:22.870 --> 00:21:26.740
record died that day aged 87. When his funeral was held a week later,

373
00:21:26.800 --> 00:21:28.660
it lasted nine whole hours.

374
00:21:28.750 --> 00:21:33.160
Such was the volume of people who wanted to pay tribute almost exactly a year

375
00:21:33.161 --> 00:21:35.080
after MasTec was buried. France, Britain,

376
00:21:35.140 --> 00:21:37.060
Italy in Germany signed the Munich agreements,

377
00:21:37.390 --> 00:21:39.580
allowing Hitler to annex the Sudeten lands.

378
00:21:39.850 --> 00:21:44.380
It was the beginning of a painful death for Czechoslovakia its border regions

379
00:21:44.381 --> 00:21:47.140
lost to Germany. The young country was forced to simply lie.

380
00:21:47.141 --> 00:21:51.610
There is first Poland and then hungry Tor yet, or chunks out of it.

381
00:21:51.820 --> 00:21:56.260
Leaving a weak rump state, barely clinging to life in March of 1939,

382
00:21:56.261 --> 00:21:59.740
Germany delivered the fatal blow Bohemia and Moravia were occupied well.

383
00:21:59.860 --> 00:22:03.670
So the Ikea was split off into a separate state under a fascist puppet

384
00:22:03.700 --> 00:22:07.480
government. Yet the story didn't end that despite its Rocky life,

385
00:22:07.510 --> 00:22:11.290
the Czech and Slovak Republic established by master egg proved durable enough

386
00:22:11.291 --> 00:22:15.970
that when world war two finally ended, it didn't stay broken and partitions.

387
00:22:16.270 --> 00:22:18.370
It was resurrected nearly whole.

388
00:22:18.520 --> 00:22:22.330
The new Czechoslovakia then lasted another 48 years surviving a communist

389
00:22:22.331 --> 00:22:26.260
takeover and decades of dictatorship before peacefully separating into the

390
00:22:26.261 --> 00:22:29.920
modern day Czech Republic and Slovakia in 1993.

391
00:22:30.040 --> 00:22:32.590
But what of Tomasz Masaryk himself? Well,

392
00:22:32.591 --> 00:22:36.730
he's still regarded as a hero in many places, not least here in Prague,

393
00:22:36.970 --> 00:22:41.410
and it's not hard to see why he was a man who didn't just lead his nation,

394
00:22:41.590 --> 00:22:45.970
but he was the sole reason for its existence before mastering the idea of an

395
00:22:45.971 --> 00:22:49.270
independent Czech and Slovak nation away from Austria.

396
00:22:49.600 --> 00:22:51.520
Chile embrace had been a pipe dream.

397
00:22:51.820 --> 00:22:55.300
It was he who took that dream and forced it into reality,

398
00:22:55.480 --> 00:22:59.080
shaping the future through the sheer force of his vision.

399
00:22:59.470 --> 00:23:03.490
And that vision is why master it is still important as someone unafraid to stand

400
00:23:03.491 --> 00:23:07.990
up for the truth for the downtrodden master rig brought a solely needed humanism

401
00:23:07.991 --> 00:23:12.190
to politics. One reflected in the tolerant state that he built short.

402
00:23:12.250 --> 00:23:16.180
He may not have truly achieved it because he never lost sight of his goal to

403
00:23:16.181 --> 00:23:20.470
build a nation in which all ethnicities could live the best lives. They could.

404
00:23:20.680 --> 00:23:23.560
His name may be obscure compared to some of his contemporaries,

405
00:23:23.561 --> 00:23:27.010
but there's no doubt that master Eric helps shapes not just central Europe's

406
00:23:27.011 --> 00:23:31.900
past, but also its present. The man himself may be long gone,

407
00:23:32.380 --> 00:23:36.550
but his dream lifts on. So I really hope you found that video. Interesting.
