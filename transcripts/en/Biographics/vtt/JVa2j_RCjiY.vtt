4
00:00:11.500 --> 00:00:15.280
And let's get into the video, the works of James Joyce, particularly UES,

5
00:00:15.600 --> 00:00:19.120
and Finnigan's way can almost universally considered classics,

6
00:00:19.460 --> 00:00:23.350
but they're a little different and than most of the great works of literature

7
00:00:23.380 --> 00:00:27.710
that have been read for decades, if not centuries, in all corners of the world,

8
00:00:28.060 --> 00:00:30.070
they aren't notorious amongst their peers.

9
00:00:30.071 --> 00:00:34.070
<v 1>They're among the most dense and difficult books to try and read they're follow</v>

10
00:00:34.071 --> 00:00:38.750
obscure language made up words in pages that just dissolve into a bizarre stream

11
00:00:38.751 --> 00:00:40.310
of consciousness, narrative,

12
00:00:40.650 --> 00:00:44.020
but something else here that's important to Ireland.

13
00:00:44.490 --> 00:00:46.020
It's not an idealized island.

14
00:00:46.290 --> 00:00:49.580
It's not some wonderful bucolic landscape worthy of a postcard.

15
00:00:49.870 --> 00:00:51.860
Joyce captures the hardships, the poverty,

16
00:00:52.040 --> 00:00:56.060
the violence suffered by so many of Dublin's turn of the century citizens.

17
00:00:56.580 --> 00:01:01.180
<v 0>The better or worse Joyce's islands is dark and dreadful. And it's so vivid.</v>

18
00:01:01.750 --> 00:01:05.890
He wrote directly from his own experiences from his family's fall,

19
00:01:05.891 --> 00:01:09.930
from middle class to the times they escaped creditors by fleeing in the night

20
00:01:10.040 --> 00:01:14.770
from his father's drunken rages to his own realization that he had in fact

21
00:01:14.771 --> 00:01:17.170
inherited more from his father than he wanted to admit.

22
00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:21.010
Joyces works may be the most difficult literature,

23
00:01:21.410 --> 00:01:24.360
but they also written from a place very close to reality.

24
00:01:24.790 --> 00:01:28.040
What kind of man was it that wrote some of the most dense,

25
00:01:28.070 --> 00:01:30.120
difficult books in the English language?

26
00:01:30.760 --> 00:01:34.160
What one who knew the same struggles as his characters,

27
00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:50.030
It's an or repeated bit of wisdom that's passed down through creative writing

28
00:01:50.031 --> 00:01:52.910
classes. Write what you know, with that in mind,

29
00:01:52.980 --> 00:01:57.550
it's only fitting that we really make an effort to capture the spirit of James

30
00:01:57.550 --> 00:02:01.230
Joyce and his work by starting somewhere in the middle of his story.

31
00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:04.180
Joyce began writing Dublin in 1904,

32
00:02:04.260 --> 00:02:07.180
a collection of short stories that would be published a decade later.

33
00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:09.380
It wasn't an easy literary birth either.

34
00:02:09.560 --> 00:02:13.180
The collection was meant to describe everyday life in Dublin with no

35
00:02:13.300 --> 00:02:16.180
embellishment. It was dark and dysfunctional. And at the same time,

36
00:02:16.200 --> 00:02:20.260
it took a very moral starts about some of the issues raised in its pages.

37
00:02:20.520 --> 00:02:23.970
The characters deal with things like feelings of failure and spare,

38
00:02:24.570 --> 00:02:25.650
then grand opportunities,

39
00:02:25.670 --> 00:02:29.490
but are too terrified to seize the day and ultimately live with regret.

40
00:02:29.600 --> 00:02:33.370
They spend money. They don't have on drink that they don't need the,

41
00:02:33.570 --> 00:02:37.090
to is full of betrayal. Misery worry, and unhappiness.

42
00:02:37.490 --> 00:02:38.690
Joyce himself described the stories.

43
00:02:39.010 --> 00:02:43.170
Disco containing a special odor of corruption. When it came time to publish,

44
00:02:43.850 --> 00:02:44.683
there was that actually a problem.

45
00:02:44.940 --> 00:02:49.080
The places Joyce describes were real and most publishers were understandably

46
00:02:49.240 --> 00:02:53.840
hesitant to print something so dark that contained real names of places from

47
00:02:53.990 --> 00:02:54.823
pubs to churches.

48
00:02:55.030 --> 00:02:58.880
There's another theme that runs throughout the book and that's one of violent

49
00:02:58.950 --> 00:02:59.783
parents.

50
00:02:59.910 --> 00:03:03.720
Fathers wonder where their sons picked up their habit of drinking and fighting,

51
00:03:04.140 --> 00:03:08.680
not realizing they learn them at home while others live in such fear of their

52
00:03:08.681 --> 00:03:09.121
fathers,

53
00:03:09.121 --> 00:03:12.920
that they start to suffer from the physical symptoms of constant terror.

54
00:03:13.270 --> 00:03:17.560
This is where we come to joy himself as his familiarity with the recurring

55
00:03:17.561 --> 00:03:22.070
themes of his works explains just how much of his childhood shaped his adult

56
00:03:22.071 --> 00:03:23.350
life. He would credit his father,

57
00:03:23.540 --> 00:03:26.590
John Stan Las with his intimate knowledge of Dublin.

58
00:03:26.810 --> 00:03:31.070
He also served as inspiration for numerous characters once writing that the

59
00:03:31.071 --> 00:03:34.590
humor of Uly is his it's people are his friends.

60
00:03:35.010 --> 00:03:36.870
The book is his spitting image.

61
00:03:37.090 --> 00:03:40.180
That's not to say their relationship was always rose colors.

62
00:03:40.250 --> 00:03:43.820
Like the pages he would eventually write Joyce's relationship with his father

63
00:03:43.920 --> 00:03:48.460
was often dark and damaged. John sta house. Wasn't the most reliable man.

64
00:03:48.640 --> 00:03:52.100
He abandoned his attempt at a medical degree in favor of his love of music.

65
00:03:52.440 --> 00:03:54.820
He was a well known singer across county cork,

66
00:03:54.840 --> 00:03:58.860
but that wasn't enough for the father of may Murray, the objective,

67
00:03:58.980 --> 00:04:02.370
his affection. They married in 1880 anyway, and right from the beginning,

68
00:04:02.460 --> 00:04:04.210
their lives were tinged with tragedy.

69
00:04:04.850 --> 00:04:06.810
Their first child died when he was only eight days old.

70
00:04:06.910 --> 00:04:08.450
And the second born on February,

71
00:04:08.451 --> 00:04:12.410
the second 1882 was named James Augustine alos Joyce.

72
00:04:12.550 --> 00:04:14.530
By the time their first surviving son was born.

73
00:04:14.760 --> 00:04:19.090
John Stan SL had secured a job as a rate collector and as they had settled into

74
00:04:19.091 --> 00:04:23.680
their first home and another example of the circular nature of Joyce's life,

75
00:04:23.730 --> 00:04:28.440
their address was the very same one that he would use for the ti character in

76
00:04:28.920 --> 00:04:31.120
ulyses Joyce's life should have been a good one.

77
00:04:31.340 --> 00:04:33.720
His father had a job that he took too well.

78
00:04:33.790 --> 00:04:37.280
They lived in a nice home and they had a regular salary to support themselves,

79
00:04:37.500 --> 00:04:40.870
but their lifestyle, particularly John Stans, Love's love of the hubs,

80
00:04:41.060 --> 00:04:44.910
made it difficult to make ends meet even as they moved into a three story home

81
00:04:44.911 --> 00:04:48.350
in Rath mines and entertained some of Dublin's most promising musicians,

82
00:04:48.580 --> 00:04:51.230
they were forced to take out loans and offer up property.

83
00:04:51.260 --> 00:04:54.950
They had inherited as collateral. Then in 1887,

84
00:04:54.951 --> 00:04:59.150
John Stan SAS claimed that he had been attacked in Phoenix park and all the cash

85
00:04:59.350 --> 00:05:00.950
she had collected that day was stolen.

86
00:05:01.520 --> 00:05:04.460
By this time his employers were already getting suspicious.

87
00:05:04.560 --> 00:05:07.020
He was no longer allowed the freedom he had enjoyed.

88
00:05:07.160 --> 00:05:08.540
And it wasn't long after that,

89
00:05:08.541 --> 00:05:12.780
the six year old Joyce was sent away to boarding school in Congo's wood college,

90
00:05:12.830 --> 00:05:16.260
while he wasn't there to see the undeniable shift in his father's moods,

91
00:05:16.261 --> 00:05:18.620
he did hear about it through his younger siblings.

92
00:05:18.840 --> 00:05:22.570
And there was quite a few of those. Joyce was the all oldest of 10 children.

93
00:05:22.930 --> 00:05:25.930
Although his mother had more pregnancies than that. And it was his brother,

94
00:05:26.410 --> 00:05:26.870
Stan LA,

95
00:05:26.870 --> 00:05:31.690
who once told him that their father had become a man of unreliable temper and

96
00:05:31.760 --> 00:05:32.590
vile humor.

97
00:05:32.590 --> 00:05:36.690
It wasn't until much later that Joyce learns things had gotten so bad that their

98
00:05:36.691 --> 00:05:40.330
mother had contemplate a divorce, which was unthinkable in Ireland at the time.

99
00:05:40.670 --> 00:05:44.600
The only reason she didn't, he was that a confessor was horrified at the idea.

100
00:05:44.740 --> 00:05:45.573
In the following years,

101
00:05:45.700 --> 00:05:48.640
the fortunes of the Joyce family continued on a downward spiral.

102
00:05:48.950 --> 00:05:53.040
John lost his job and was denied a full pension because of his poor employment

103
00:05:53.041 --> 00:05:56.320
history. As his debts mounted, he was forced to sell some of his property.

104
00:05:56.660 --> 00:06:00.160
The rest were seized by debt collectors. Despite being at boarding school,

105
00:06:00.170 --> 00:06:03.120
Joyce was still around to see enough of his familial misfortune,

106
00:06:03.121 --> 00:06:05.280
that it would leave a lasting mark on him.

107
00:06:05.500 --> 00:06:07.360
His sympathy for the plight of young children,

108
00:06:07.361 --> 00:06:10.680
living in fear and poverty would become a regular influence on his work.

109
00:06:10.930 --> 00:06:14.560
Joyce eventually left boarding school altogether returning home to his family,

110
00:06:14.610 --> 00:06:18.190
which moved nine times and 11 years with his mother's help.

111
00:06:18.191 --> 00:06:20.870
He took charge of his own schooling. Eventually he and his brother,

112
00:06:21.270 --> 00:06:23.830
Stan LA would attend BLV college. Well,

113
00:06:23.860 --> 00:06:26.270
they were admitted tuition free from there.

114
00:06:26.370 --> 00:06:28.790
It was onto university college in Dublin web,

115
00:06:28.980 --> 00:06:30.910
despite his familiar impoverishment,

116
00:06:31.130 --> 00:06:34.150
the young Joyce quickly earned himself the nickname sunny gym,

117
00:06:34.260 --> 00:06:37.780
because it was so quick to laugh by the time he had finished school.

118
00:06:38.040 --> 00:06:39.780
The situation at home was di

119
00:06:46.090 --> 00:06:48.780
When Joyce graduated from university in 1902,

120
00:06:48.781 --> 00:06:52.980
the rest of the family was living in a home that a family friend described

121
00:06:52.981 --> 00:06:57.340
poorly. The banisters were broken. The grass in the backyard was all blackened.

122
00:06:57.760 --> 00:07:01.570
They said there was a laundry there and a few chickens, and it was a very,

123
00:07:01.920 --> 00:07:03.970
very miserable home. Joyce's brother.

124
00:07:04.410 --> 00:07:07.810
Stan Las wrote extensively on the continued downward spiral of the family.

125
00:07:08.080 --> 00:07:11.490
When their father was sober, he was easy and pleasant, reminiscing,

126
00:07:11.550 --> 00:07:15.330
and humorous. When he was drunk, he was lying and hypocritical,

127
00:07:15.890 --> 00:07:20.000
a crazy drunkard, the large family splintered and struggled joy,

128
00:07:20.200 --> 00:07:23.560
set it off to Paris with a desire to pursue the same medical degree that his

129
00:07:23.561 --> 00:07:26.120
father had abandoned, albeit with no money.

130
00:07:26.340 --> 00:07:29.760
He skated by earning what he could by teaching English and writing the odd

131
00:07:29.761 --> 00:07:32.960
article. But it wasn't long before he was summoned back to Dublin,

132
00:07:32.980 --> 00:07:36.000
his mother was dying and she wanted to see him one last time.

133
00:07:36.260 --> 00:07:39.190
And here too is a very real snapshot in time.

134
00:07:39.260 --> 00:07:44.190
That makes its way into Joyce's work later in a portrait of the artist as

135
00:07:44.191 --> 00:07:46.350
a young man, a character denies his mother,

136
00:07:46.410 --> 00:07:48.750
her dying wish and is consumed with guilt.

137
00:07:48.920 --> 00:07:52.430
Joyce had a parallel experience when he returned to Irelands and found his

138
00:07:52.431 --> 00:07:53.470
mother dying of liver cancer.

139
00:07:53.930 --> 00:07:56.910
She asked him to take confession and holy communion,

140
00:07:57.220 --> 00:08:00.500
Joyce's Catholic faith that lapsed blood long ago, and he refused.

141
00:08:00.760 --> 00:08:04.340
He also refused his uncle's request to pray at his mother's bedside.

142
00:08:04.410 --> 00:08:07.300
When she died, the guilt showed up later in his work,

143
00:08:07.450 --> 00:08:10.140
even as Joyce and his siblings were watching their mother die,

144
00:08:10.141 --> 00:08:12.220
their father was spiraling outta control.

145
00:08:12.900 --> 00:08:16.580
San Sal's diary recorded one particularly heartbreaking incidents where John

146
00:08:16.900 --> 00:08:19.420
Stan Claus's drunk out of his mind, wandered into their,

147
00:08:19.650 --> 00:08:23.450
a sick room and burst out. I'm finished. I can't do anymore.

148
00:08:23.970 --> 00:08:28.130
If you can't get well die, die, and be damned to you.

149
00:08:28.660 --> 00:08:31.930
Joyce stepped in to head off a fight between his brother and their father.

150
00:08:32.150 --> 00:08:35.050
And according to the diaries, his siblings kept in the following years.

151
00:08:35.690 --> 00:08:39.090
The relationship soured, John would often shout and scream when he was drunk.

152
00:08:39.190 --> 00:08:43.440
And now he screamed about how much he hated his children and his eldest in

153
00:08:43.441 --> 00:08:44.560
particular, one by one,

154
00:08:44.700 --> 00:08:47.800
his children left and for the final decade of their father's life,

155
00:08:47.980 --> 00:08:49.920
he lived alone in a boarding house.

156
00:08:50.220 --> 00:08:54.000
He died in 1931 and when his land lady cleaned out his room,

157
00:08:54.380 --> 00:08:58.920
all he had was some clothes and a copy of his son's play exiles.

158
00:08:59.220 --> 00:09:03.480
And as for Joyce, he didn't hate his father. In fact, after John Stan SALs died,

159
00:09:03.960 --> 00:09:07.080
Joyce appealed to the city of Dublin and asked that he be allowed to purchase a

160
00:09:07.081 --> 00:09:09.440
bench in an area near the hospital where he had passed.

161
00:09:09.580 --> 00:09:13.960
He was refused at the time, but his request was not forgotten. In 2018,

162
00:09:14.040 --> 00:09:14.750
a bench were,

163
00:09:14.750 --> 00:09:18.150
was finally installed with an inscription that read James Joyce wished that a

164
00:09:18.151 --> 00:09:21.350
bench be placed here in memory of his father, John Joyce,

165
00:09:21.610 --> 00:09:24.030
who lived nearby and died in this place.

166
00:09:24.410 --> 00:09:29.270
So how about a random fact about James Joyce? He was a big time PLO speaking,

167
00:09:29.460 --> 00:09:32.350
five languages fluently and being competent in many,

168
00:09:32.351 --> 00:09:36.180
many more as if you want to take a leaf out of all one of his books. Well,

169
00:09:36.240 --> 00:09:38.700
that's where today's sponsor. Babble comes in.

170
00:09:38.870 --> 00:09:41.340
Maybe you need to brush up your language skills for work,

171
00:09:41.360 --> 00:09:44.740
or maybe you just want the opportunity to go and work abroad or something. Well,

172
00:09:44.760 --> 00:09:48.900
either way you can brush up or just begin learning a language with babble,

173
00:09:49.220 --> 00:09:52.820
and you might already had a crack at learning language with some basic free app

174
00:09:52.821 --> 00:09:56.290
from the app store, but B does away with a six indeed.

175
00:09:56.320 --> 00:09:59.930
It's the number one language learning app in the world with 14 different

176
00:10:00.090 --> 00:10:04.050
languages currently available. So why is B better than the rest? Well,

177
00:10:04.051 --> 00:10:07.570
importantly, they're the strong focus on confidence building,

178
00:10:07.580 --> 00:10:11.050
which is a huge part of learning a language.

179
00:10:11.190 --> 00:10:13.730
You can learn all of the vocab and grammar nuance,

180
00:10:13.870 --> 00:10:15.650
but if you don't have a chance to speak,

181
00:10:16.180 --> 00:10:20.000
not really gonna make any progress that all simulates conversations with native

182
00:10:20.001 --> 00:10:23.240
speakers and users, voice recognition technology to make that happen.

183
00:10:23.330 --> 00:10:27.120
Their courses are all designed by experts rather than just constructed by an

184
00:10:27.121 --> 00:10:30.080
algorithm, which doesn't consider things like your native language.

185
00:10:30.170 --> 00:10:33.600
It'll also consider how you like to learn with topics that you are interested

186
00:10:33.620 --> 00:10:37.310
in. They've got an app as well. So it's really easy to just jump and practice.

187
00:10:37.550 --> 00:10:40.590
Whenever you have a down moment and those short few minutes of practice,

188
00:10:40.591 --> 00:10:42.110
while they really do all add up,

189
00:10:42.140 --> 00:10:44.630
it's also very nicely designed and it's easy to use.

190
00:10:44.970 --> 00:10:49.270
So start learning a new language today with B sign up for a three month

191
00:10:49.271 --> 00:10:51.150
subscription and get three months for free.

192
00:10:51.340 --> 00:10:53.950
There's a link below and let's get back to Joyce.

193
00:11:00.670 --> 00:11:02.420
Every artist needs a good muse.

194
00:11:02.480 --> 00:11:06.700
And Joyce met his not long after the passing of his mother. He was 22 years old,

195
00:11:06.890 --> 00:11:07.940
just back from Paris.

196
00:11:08.200 --> 00:11:12.540
And he had decided to stay in Dublin for a bit to teach and write book reviews.

197
00:11:12.980 --> 00:11:16.500
It was around that time that Joyce spotted a young redheaded girl walking down

198
00:11:16.501 --> 00:11:18.570
the street in dub. He approached her,

199
00:11:18.890 --> 00:11:20.730
asked her for a date and she never showed up.

200
00:11:21.170 --> 00:11:24.370
It wasn't about to be dissuaded though. So when he asked her again, well,

201
00:11:24.510 --> 00:11:25.890
she did more than just show up.

202
00:11:26.070 --> 00:11:28.450
The mystery woman left quite an impression on Joyce.

203
00:11:28.810 --> 00:11:32.690
He would later describe that second date as the day she made me a man.

204
00:11:33.090 --> 00:11:37.050
The first date was a date. He would never forget. It was June the 16th, 1904.

205
00:11:37.070 --> 00:11:41.560
And it ultimately be came the date he would later use as the setting for ulyses

206
00:11:41.900 --> 00:11:42.733
as for the girl,

207
00:11:42.780 --> 00:11:47.720
her name was Nora barnacle and she was a Galway girl working in Dublin as a

208
00:11:47.721 --> 00:11:48.300
chamber mate.

209
00:11:48.300 --> 00:11:52.400
It was only a few months later in October that James and Nora left islands for

210
00:11:52.401 --> 00:11:55.280
the continents eventually settling in Trias in Italy.

211
00:11:55.430 --> 00:11:57.120
It's often said that they eloped,

212
00:11:57.121 --> 00:12:01.240
but Joyce made it very clear that his parents offered difficult relationship.

213
00:12:01.480 --> 00:12:03.240
Had soured him on the idea of marriage.

214
00:12:03.540 --> 00:12:08.400
He wrote my home was simply a middle class affair ruined by spend thrift habits,

215
00:12:08.401 --> 00:12:11.400
which I have inherited. My mother was slowly killed.

216
00:12:11.720 --> 00:12:16.070
I think by father's ill treatment, I cursed the system which made her a victim.

217
00:12:16.710 --> 00:12:20.310
Dad said there was absolutely no doubt that he was completely devoted to Nora.

218
00:12:20.410 --> 00:12:22.590
And so that they were passionately in love with each other,

219
00:12:22.850 --> 00:12:26.990
for all of their days, say for a few short trips, they were almost never apart.

220
00:12:26.991 --> 00:12:30.310
And even though they didn't officially marry and until 1931,

221
00:12:30.311 --> 00:12:33.300
there was no question that Joyce had found his me used.

222
00:12:33.360 --> 00:12:37.780
And Nora had found the love of her life when they left Ireland and Joyce never

223
00:12:37.790 --> 00:12:40.780
truly recorded his reasons for leaving in any sort of concrete way.

224
00:12:41.090 --> 00:12:45.620
They boarded a ship separately to avoid chatter from his family. As for Nora,

225
00:12:45.640 --> 00:12:49.220
it was an almost unfathomable risk. She wasn't married after all.

226
00:12:49.440 --> 00:12:53.180
And at the time literally hopping onto a ship and leaving her home to travel

227
00:12:53.240 --> 00:12:56.090
the, with a man would've been a major scandal.

228
00:12:56.640 --> 00:12:59.690
Nora was putting a lot of faith in him too. If he had abandoned her,

229
00:12:59.870 --> 00:13:02.730
she would've had no way to support herself and returning home.

230
00:13:02.731 --> 00:13:06.210
Would've been tricky outside of Irelands, their life. Wasn't just an easy,

231
00:13:06.400 --> 00:13:07.330
free flowing romance.

232
00:13:07.720 --> 00:13:11.490
They first headed to Zurich where the job Joyce was chasing fell through.

233
00:13:11.760 --> 00:13:12.331
From there,

234
00:13:12.331 --> 00:13:16.000
it was off to triage where some of choices inherited traits from his father,

235
00:13:16.440 --> 00:13:19.360
rid themselves for a time Joyce skated through on odd jobs,

236
00:13:19.440 --> 00:13:23.160
carrying a ton of debt and massive loans and drinking so much.

237
00:13:23.180 --> 00:13:27.120
And so often that he relied on the kindness of strangers to carry him home.

238
00:13:27.410 --> 00:13:27.860
Still.

239
00:13:27.860 --> 00:13:32.480
She gave birth to their first child Giorgio in 1905 and their second Lu

240
00:13:32.980 --> 00:13:36.110
in 1907, while always struggled to write and get published.

241
00:13:36.250 --> 00:13:38.750
She raised the children and acted as his assistant,

242
00:13:38.850 --> 00:13:41.750
the iron tooth problems that would plague him for decades had already begun.

243
00:13:42.010 --> 00:13:42.530
So too,

244
00:13:42.530 --> 00:13:46.630
had his tendency to pick moments and characters out of his life to write about

245
00:13:47.010 --> 00:13:50.110
in 1909, he headed back to Ireland for a visit. He was alone.

246
00:13:50.210 --> 00:13:54.310
And when a mutual acquaintance suggested that he too had enjoyed Nora's company

247
00:13:54.550 --> 00:13:57.260
in a rather him, what way Joyce was incensed.

248
00:13:57.360 --> 00:14:00.580
It was at that moment that he made it a point to visit the grave site of one of

249
00:14:00.581 --> 00:14:01.700
her previous boyfriends.

250
00:14:02.100 --> 00:14:06.100
He would ultimately base characters in Dublins on Nora and, uh, dead lover.

251
00:14:12.140 --> 00:14:15.450
James and Nora were still living in Italy at the outbreak of world war I

252
00:14:15.800 --> 00:14:18.520
&lt;affirmative&gt;. And that's when they moved again, back to Urich.

253
00:14:18.590 --> 00:14:22.320
Some years later after the great European conflict was over the lovers,

254
00:14:22.321 --> 00:14:25.520
moved on to Paris. In the meantime, he had written works like exiles,

255
00:14:25.521 --> 00:14:29.160
the play that would be found in his father's boarding house room after his death

256
00:14:29.380 --> 00:14:32.680
and the autobiographical portrait of the artist as a young man,

257
00:14:32.820 --> 00:14:36.830
but he hadn't been met with the kind of success that most, I just hope for.

258
00:14:37.030 --> 00:14:40.470
I said his work was greeted with something a little closer to confusion,

259
00:14:40.530 --> 00:14:43.230
but in 1922, on Joyce's 40th birthday,

260
00:14:43.490 --> 00:14:47.390
he would finally publish what would become his most famous work UES.

261
00:14:47.690 --> 00:14:51.560
And it's almost impossible to give Joyce his full due because he had no

262
00:14:51.561 --> 00:14:54.840
intentions of leaving any detail up to his imagination.

263
00:14:54.990 --> 00:14:59.760
Take the house at seven ale street, it's a real house. And in one scene,

264
00:15:00.060 --> 00:15:04.040
his T while protagonist, Leo, Paul bloom returns home and finds,

265
00:15:04.041 --> 00:15:04.920
he doesn't have his key.

266
00:15:05.060 --> 00:15:07.920
He decides that instead of bothering his wife to come to the door,

267
00:15:08.110 --> 00:15:11.150
he's going to hop the railing and get in through another door.

268
00:15:11.260 --> 00:15:12.710
This is straightforward enough.

269
00:15:12.711 --> 00:15:16.870
And most authors would be fine with a possibility that there might be a little

270
00:15:17.190 --> 00:15:18.710
creative license taken with the scene.

271
00:15:19.310 --> 00:15:22.670
The railing might be a little too high in the real world or the drop a little

272
00:15:22.730 --> 00:15:25.590
too far, but on November the second, 1921,

273
00:15:25.600 --> 00:15:29.390
Joyce wrote to his arm since Aster to double check for him to make sure that it

274
00:15:29.391 --> 00:15:31.340
could be done. He had seen it done,

275
00:15:31.480 --> 00:15:34.740
but by someone young and athletic would his 38 year old,

276
00:15:34.790 --> 00:15:36.300
every man be able to do it.

277
00:15:36.480 --> 00:15:40.540
So did his aunt actually head out into the Dublin streets to check on whether or

278
00:15:40.541 --> 00:15:42.460
not it was possible? It's hard to say,

279
00:15:42.520 --> 00:15:46.820
but it's also the perfect example of just how committed Joyce was to capturing

280
00:15:46.821 --> 00:15:49.060
the streets of Dublin in a very grounded,

281
00:15:49.110 --> 00:15:53.850
ultra realistic sort of way that dedication didn't come without a

282
00:15:53.851 --> 00:15:55.730
price. Once U was published,

283
00:15:55.731 --> 00:15:59.610
he was hesitant to return to his home country because he was afraid of being

284
00:15:59.720 --> 00:16:02.170
sued for Lial. As soon as it rolled off the presses,

285
00:16:02.230 --> 00:16:04.210
the book was an instant source of controversy.

286
00:16:04.640 --> 00:16:07.210
Critics didn't just argue about the worth of the text,

287
00:16:07.350 --> 00:16:11.050
but they argued what the actual manuscript was supposed to say.

288
00:16:11.100 --> 00:16:15.200
There were so many to the text and corrections made by the printers that even

289
00:16:15.201 --> 00:16:18.400
decades after Joyce's death, no one is really sure.

290
00:16:18.590 --> 00:16:20.880
Just what version he actually wanted.

291
00:16:20.950 --> 00:16:24.080
Printed is also worth clearing up a common misconception.

292
00:16:24.260 --> 00:16:28.680
The book was banned in the UK where census decided that it made no sense

293
00:16:28.730 --> 00:16:32.360
whatsoever and was undeniably filthy. It stayed on the,

294
00:16:32.590 --> 00:16:35.470
a list until 1936, but it was never prohibited in Ireland.

295
00:16:35.730 --> 00:16:40.390
The movie based on the book was released in 1967 and immediately banned a

296
00:16:40.391 --> 00:16:45.230
restriction that would only be lifted 33 years later after finishing ulyses

297
00:16:45.231 --> 00:16:48.750
Joyce put down his pen for an entire year when he finally picked it up again,

298
00:16:48.860 --> 00:16:51.910
what came out on the page was just downright bizarre.

299
00:16:52.170 --> 00:16:55.500
He wrote Finnigans were week between 1923 and 1939.

300
00:16:55.501 --> 00:16:57.620
And it's been called things like cryptic,

301
00:16:57.830 --> 00:17:02.700
which is putting it very mildly regardless of its difficulty or value.

302
00:17:02.890 --> 00:17:07.260
It's impossible to deny that finishing the work consumed Joice for much of the

303
00:17:07.261 --> 00:17:10.020
rest of his life. By the time Finnigan's wake was ready for print.

304
00:17:10.300 --> 00:17:14.730
As chronic eye troubles had degraded to the point where he was near blind and he

305
00:17:14.731 --> 00:17:17.930
relied on Nora for constant help his history of medical problems,

306
00:17:17.931 --> 00:17:20.050
particularly with his eyes isn't for the squeamish.

307
00:17:20.070 --> 00:17:24.450
He had undergone a series of operations that had removed and reshaped parts of

308
00:17:24.451 --> 00:17:27.010
his eyes. And he had had all of his teeth removed as well.

309
00:17:27.190 --> 00:17:31.050
He underwent his seventh thigh operation in 1925 and it left him in constant

310
00:17:31.160 --> 00:17:33.650
pain. Still. He was far from being able to rest.

311
00:17:34.280 --> 00:17:35.680
That was another threat on the horizon.

312
00:17:42.360 --> 00:17:45.200
No long after Finnegan's wake was published. World war II broke out.

313
00:17:45.420 --> 00:17:48.880
The Joyce family was already working through problems of their own. Their son,

314
00:17:49.200 --> 00:17:52.440
George was facing difficulties with alcohol and their daughter was struggling

315
00:17:52.640 --> 00:17:55.000
too. After our relationship with Samuel Beckett fell apart,

316
00:17:55.140 --> 00:17:57.360
she drifted into a steep mental decline.

317
00:17:57.800 --> 00:18:01.960
Lu was in a mental clinic when the arts occupation of France was imminence and

318
00:18:02.100 --> 00:18:05.800
the Joyces knew that they needed leave. They appealed to the Irish diplomat,

319
00:18:06.560 --> 00:18:09.070
Sean Lester for helping in escaping from France. So well, Joyce,

320
00:18:09.260 --> 00:18:11.670
Nora and their son were able to return to Zurich.

321
00:18:11.970 --> 00:18:16.310
Lu was left behind and spent the war years in VII by all accounts,

322
00:18:16.311 --> 00:18:18.750
Joyce didn't deal well with his daughter's suffering.

323
00:18:18.890 --> 00:18:21.870
He San into a deep depression that delayed his work.

324
00:18:21.890 --> 00:18:24.750
And when they were forced to leave her behind at the outbreak of war,

325
00:18:24.890 --> 00:18:25.950
he was devastated.

326
00:18:26.290 --> 00:18:30.980
Lu Joyce's story is a tragic one treated by Carl Young and diagnosed as a

327
00:18:31.100 --> 00:18:31.800
schizophrenic.

328
00:18:31.800 --> 00:18:36.380
She was a promising young dancer when Beckett rejected her saying he had only

329
00:18:36.381 --> 00:18:38.660
been trying to get close to her father. Not her,

330
00:18:38.800 --> 00:18:41.860
her behavior became more and more erratic. And it wasn't long after that,

331
00:18:41.861 --> 00:18:45.300
that she held a chair at her mother that made her brother get her committed.

332
00:18:45.590 --> 00:18:48.300
After the end of world war II, she was transferred to north Hampton.

333
00:18:48.760 --> 00:18:53.130
She remained for of her life. She died there in 1982, as for Joyce,

334
00:18:53.350 --> 00:18:57.290
his death came not long after he moved most of his family to the relative safety

335
00:18:57.310 --> 00:18:59.010
of Zurich. By all accounts,

336
00:18:59.170 --> 00:19:02.490
he was still heartbroken at the less than favorable reception critics and

337
00:19:02.600 --> 00:19:05.010
audiences gave his complex Finnigans wake.

338
00:19:05.030 --> 00:19:09.250
And he was bearing that disappointment. When he died on January the 13th,

339
00:19:10.280 --> 00:19:10.460
19 41, 1,

340
00:19:10.460 --> 00:19:14.880
he was having a surgery for a perforated ulcer when he passed away at the age of

341
00:19:14.881 --> 00:19:15.540
58,

342
00:19:15.540 --> 00:19:19.560
the controversy around Joyce didn't stop with his death because his death was so

343
00:19:19.561 --> 00:19:23.320
sudden and unexpected. There were no plans for his death. And at the time,

344
00:19:23.540 --> 00:19:27.200
Marlin was less than worried about properly honoring the man who would

345
00:19:27.201 --> 00:19:29.400
eventually become one of his most famous authors.

346
00:19:29.590 --> 00:19:33.390
When Nora asked the government of repatriates remains for burial on his native

347
00:19:33.500 --> 00:19:36.950
soil, a request was refused. Irish diplomats in Zurich,

348
00:19:36.951 --> 00:19:40.350
didn't attend the funeral. And some of the telegrams sent to those diplomats.

349
00:19:40.351 --> 00:19:42.790
Weren't exactly sympathetic. One of them read,

350
00:19:42.791 --> 00:19:45.790
please wire details about Joyce's death. If possible,

351
00:19:46.100 --> 00:19:50.110
find out if he died a Catholic NORRA two died in Zurich in 1951,

352
00:19:50.111 --> 00:19:53.180
thanks to acute renal failure. She was 67 years old.

353
00:19:53.200 --> 00:19:54.420
And at the time of her death,

354
00:19:54.650 --> 00:19:59.340
it's worth noting that she hadn't seen her daughter since 1936 refusing to visit

355
00:19:59.360 --> 00:20:03.820
her in the institution that they had confined her to last year, 2019,

356
00:20:03.880 --> 00:20:08.180
the Dublin city council put forward a bid to do exactly what Nora had requested.

357
00:20:08.280 --> 00:20:13.210
So many years, PR repatriate choices remains. The backlash was swift.

358
00:20:13.380 --> 00:20:16.930
Joyce May have written some of the most detailed accounts of Irish life that the

359
00:20:16.931 --> 00:20:18.570
modern literary world had ever seen,

360
00:20:18.790 --> 00:20:23.130
but he had repeatedly refused Irish citizenship and actually died as a British

361
00:20:23.131 --> 00:20:25.730
citizen. And that's the ultimate irony of choice.

362
00:20:25.910 --> 00:20:27.650
One that's been debated for a long time.

363
00:20:27.670 --> 00:20:30.610
And one that will continue to puzzle those who consider him.

364
00:20:30.830 --> 00:20:32.440
One of Ireland's fine writers.

365
00:20:32.770 --> 00:20:36.160
Joyce was able to create works that captured some of Ireland's deepest,

366
00:20:36.230 --> 00:20:37.240
darkest truths,

367
00:20:37.500 --> 00:20:41.360
but he also spent much of his life unwilling to return to the homelands that

368
00:20:41.510 --> 00:20:44.360
gave him life and made him famous. Joyce's story.

369
00:20:44.361 --> 00:20:48.240
Isn't one of high literature or the quintessential birth of a writer.

370
00:20:48.630 --> 00:20:52.600
It's about the complicated relationship we have with the things and the people

371
00:20:53.270 --> 00:20:56.400
that shape our lives. So I really hope you found that video. Interesting.
