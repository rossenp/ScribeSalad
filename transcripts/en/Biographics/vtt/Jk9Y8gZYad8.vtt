1
00:00:00.060 --> 00:00:04.650
<v 0>Gold with his 17 millions was one of the colossal failures of our time.</v>

2
00:00:04.800 --> 00:00:09.120
He was a purely selfish man. His greed consumed his charity.

3
00:00:09.240 --> 00:00:13.890
He was like death and hell gathering and all giving back nothing.

4
00:00:13.950 --> 00:00:17.510
These were words spoken at a sermon shortly after Jay Gould's death.

5
00:00:17.700 --> 00:00:21.630
And they are representative of what much of the American public thought about

6
00:00:21.631 --> 00:00:22.860
the rich industrialist.

7
00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:26.460
He was regarded as one of the worst examples of the robber Baron suit thrived

8
00:00:26.490 --> 00:00:30.450
during the economic boom of America's gilded age gold would become one of the

9
00:00:30.451 --> 00:00:31.500
richest men in the country,

10
00:00:31.530 --> 00:00:34.830
and he didn't care who he had to crush to achieve his goals.

11
00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:38.520
Many of the methods Gould employed would simply be illegal today,

12
00:00:38.521 --> 00:00:39.540
but even back then,

13
00:00:39.541 --> 00:00:42.750
they were enough to make and hated by his fellow businessmen.

14
00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:45.420
But there was another group who hated him even more.

15
00:00:45.720 --> 00:00:50.190
The press Gould operated during the rise of yellow journalism pioneered by

16
00:00:50.191 --> 00:00:52.890
Joseph Pulitzer and William Randolph Hearst,

17
00:00:53.130 --> 00:00:57.390
then newspapers focused on scandals and sensationalism to sell copies a

18
00:00:57.391 --> 00:00:59.160
technique which works wonders.

19
00:00:59.220 --> 00:01:03.090
Some historians who are trying to rehabilitate Jay Gould's image argue that he

20
00:01:03.091 --> 00:01:06.960
was a favorite whipping by of the press, particularly Pulitzer's New York world,

21
00:01:06.961 --> 00:01:09.600
which he actually purchased from gold in 1883.

22
00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:14.130
They believe that the industrialists negative reputation was mainly a creation

23
00:01:14.131 --> 00:01:15.090
of the media ruins.

24
00:01:15.091 --> 00:01:19.380
That gold was not especially more or less ruthless than all of the other

25
00:01:19.381 --> 00:01:22.740
business magnates of his time. We'll let you decide that for yourself though.

26
00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:27.270
We'll just present a story and you can draw your own conclusions regarding the

27
00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:30.210
quintessential robber Baron Jay Gould.

28
00:01:42.290 --> 00:01:43.123
<v 1>[Inaudible].</v>

29
00:01:43.790 --> 00:01:48.020
<v 0>Jason J. Gould was born on may the 27th, 1836 in Roxbury, New York,</v>

30
00:01:48.050 --> 00:01:50.990
the son of John burgles and Mary Moore.

31
00:01:51.290 --> 00:01:55.460
He was descended from Scottish immigrants and his new English Puritans his great

32
00:01:55.461 --> 00:01:57.110
grandfather on his mother's side.

33
00:01:57.140 --> 00:02:01.670
John Moore came to America in 1772 and founded the small town of

34
00:02:01.671 --> 00:02:04.310
Morrisville known today as grand Gorge. His son,

35
00:02:04.340 --> 00:02:08.510
John Taylor Moore became an influential politician in New York who served as

36
00:02:08.511 --> 00:02:12.290
state Senator and as a member of the New York state assembly, multiple times,

37
00:02:12.320 --> 00:02:15.680
by the time Jay gold was born, most of that power and wealth had diminished.

38
00:02:15.770 --> 00:02:19.970
His parents were just quiet farmers and it was expected that Jay would follow in

39
00:02:19.971 --> 00:02:23.030
his father's footsteps. However, he had no interest in farming.

40
00:02:23.031 --> 00:02:27.470
So instead he began working various odd jobs after receiving a basic education

41
00:02:27.471 --> 00:02:28.640
at the school in Hobart,

42
00:02:28.641 --> 00:02:32.810
New York first Gould worked at his father's store and in his free time taught

43
00:02:32.811 --> 00:02:33.644
himself surveying.

44
00:02:33.800 --> 00:02:37.400
He was good enough that he turns this into his new profession for a few years

45
00:02:37.580 --> 00:02:41.540
after he surveyed several of the Southern counties of New York Gould wrote and

46
00:02:41.541 --> 00:02:44.210
published a book when he was only 19 years old,

47
00:02:44.270 --> 00:02:48.890
titled history of Delaware County and border Wars of New York afterwards,

48
00:02:49.220 --> 00:02:50.870
Gould was employed by blacksmith shop,

49
00:02:50.871 --> 00:02:54.200
where he learns about a different trade that will become his first true business

50
00:02:54.410 --> 00:02:57.230
leather tanning. During the 1850s, he used the money.

51
00:02:57.320 --> 00:03:01.210
He had saved up to open a tannery in Pennsylvania and an areas that would later

52
00:03:01.211 --> 00:03:03.430
become the town of Gouldsborough in his own neck.

53
00:03:03.490 --> 00:03:08.170
He did this in partnership with a man named Zanuck Pratt 45 years older than

54
00:03:08.530 --> 00:03:11.890
ghouls, perhaps once operated the largest tannery in the world in the Catskill

55
00:03:11.891 --> 00:03:14.530
mountains. However, as the advanced in age,

56
00:03:14.531 --> 00:03:18.580
he preferred instead to finance multiple smaller tanneries and let his younger

57
00:03:18.581 --> 00:03:22.180
partners do the hard work. That is also what he did with gold.

58
00:03:22.181 --> 00:03:26.020
Although their partnership only lasted for a few years before proffer Todd for

59
00:03:26.021 --> 00:03:29.110
goods and is up and coming coworker bought out his shares.

60
00:03:29.130 --> 00:03:29.963
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

61
00:03:35.910 --> 00:03:40.200
<v 0>Early on, Jay Gould concluded that any serious money would be made in New York.</v>

62
00:03:40.290 --> 00:03:43.350
Therefore, as soon as he made some significant cash from his tannery,

63
00:03:43.351 --> 00:03:46.260
he moved to the city and began speculating on the stock market.

64
00:03:46.410 --> 00:03:50.190
But this time gold also partnered with a leather merchant named Charles lib,

65
00:03:50.220 --> 00:03:55.110
but their joint venture ended on considerably worse terms than with Pratt gold

66
00:03:55.111 --> 00:03:58.590
was a risk taker. They used the money that he received from investors,

67
00:03:58.620 --> 00:04:02.070
primarily lib to try and corner the hide market. However,

68
00:04:02.100 --> 00:04:05.310
then came the panic of 1857, a financial crash,

69
00:04:05.340 --> 00:04:09.390
which was greatly exacerbated in the United States by the sinking of the SS

70
00:04:09.391 --> 00:04:13.590
central America, a ship carrying a giant shipment of gold from California.

71
00:04:13.620 --> 00:04:16.860
Banks took heavy losses and investments went bottom up,

72
00:04:17.340 --> 00:04:20.220
Liam lost everything and ended up committing suicide.

73
00:04:20.580 --> 00:04:24.120
And the decades that followed the stories that went around was that gold

74
00:04:24.121 --> 00:04:28.320
intentionally drove his partner into poverty and death by making dangerous

75
00:04:28.321 --> 00:04:32.280
transactions so that he would then be able to buy out all of his properties for

76
00:04:32.281 --> 00:04:32.790
cheap.

77
00:04:32.790 --> 00:04:36.510
This is a good example of the kind of tales that were propagated about Google in

78
00:04:36.511 --> 00:04:40.170
his own time detailing the viciousness of his business dealings,

79
00:04:40.171 --> 00:04:43.770
but there was really little evidence to back them up in this particular case,

80
00:04:43.800 --> 00:04:45.870
what Google did was certainly risky,

81
00:04:45.871 --> 00:04:49.320
but he could hardly be blamed for the panic of 1857. Furthermore,

82
00:04:49.480 --> 00:04:52.530
more had been documented that Charles Lee had suffered from mental problems,

83
00:04:52.531 --> 00:04:54.480
such as depression and severe paranoia,

84
00:04:54.481 --> 00:04:57.930
which undoubtedly contributed to his suicide. That being said,

85
00:04:58.230 --> 00:05:01.680
Gould was certainly no saints by any stretch of the imagination.

86
00:05:02.060 --> 00:05:02.760
Often Liam's death.

87
00:05:02.760 --> 00:05:06.360
There was a dispute over ownership of the tannery and Goldsboro between Jay

88
00:05:06.361 --> 00:05:08.430
Gould and another one of his investors,

89
00:05:08.820 --> 00:05:12.750
layups brother-in-law David Williams and leave this dispute lasted for 10 years.

90
00:05:12.751 --> 00:05:15.570
And eventually the courts ruled in Lee's favor. By that point,

91
00:05:15.870 --> 00:05:19.140
Gould was already a very rich man and the tannery wasn't worth much anyway.

92
00:05:19.141 --> 00:05:22.380
So he sold his interest to the Lee family for a nominal fee.

93
00:05:22.560 --> 00:05:26.280
It just goes to show the kind of man the good was he was willing to fight tooth

94
00:05:26.281 --> 00:05:29.820
and nail for years for something that he didn't even care about,

95
00:05:30.030 --> 00:05:32.850
just so that he wasn't the one on the losing side

96
00:05:39.690 --> 00:05:41.250
Done with the tanning business.

97
00:05:41.251 --> 00:05:45.120
Gold became a fully fledged stockbroker on wall street. He had a knack for this,

98
00:05:45.121 --> 00:05:49.260
but he also used every advantage at his disposal to manipulate the market to his

99
00:05:49.261 --> 00:05:53.130
advantage. This included tactics, which although unethical were illegal,

100
00:05:53.131 --> 00:05:57.300
such as short-selling, but he was also alleged to have bribed politicians,

101
00:05:57.410 --> 00:05:57.951
judges,

102
00:05:57.951 --> 00:06:02.210
and anyone else necessary in order to pass favorable legislation and shut down

103
00:06:02.211 --> 00:06:04.370
laws that worked against him. However,

104
00:06:04.430 --> 00:06:07.550
he truly emerged as one of the country's leading industrialists.

105
00:06:07.551 --> 00:06:10.130
When he began getting involved in railroads,

106
00:06:10.190 --> 00:06:14.030
he first dipped his toes into these waters in 1857, right after the panic,

107
00:06:14.120 --> 00:06:15.170
as the stocks plunge,

108
00:06:15.180 --> 00:06:18.530
the Rutlands and Washington railroads that connected Rutlands of the monster

109
00:06:18.560 --> 00:06:21.380
Eagle bridge New York was on the brink of bankruptcy.

110
00:06:21.470 --> 00:06:25.370
The opportunity presented itself for gold to purchase a controlling interest in

111
00:06:25.371 --> 00:06:28.850
the railway for 10 cents on the dollar afterwards, he had it repaired.

112
00:06:28.850 --> 00:06:32.480
And as the railroad managed to weather, the financial storm of 1857,

113
00:06:32.690 --> 00:06:35.900
it then became commercially successful. Then in just a couple of years,

114
00:06:35.901 --> 00:06:39.380
gold sold it for a large profit. This was a nice start,

115
00:06:39.410 --> 00:06:43.880
but it mainly serve to show the businessmen that a lot of money could be made in

116
00:06:43.881 --> 00:06:44.714
railroads.

117
00:06:44.840 --> 00:06:48.530
He then set a science a lot higher on the Erie railroad triggering a conflict

118
00:06:48.531 --> 00:06:52.010
between four of America's richest men known as the Arie war.

119
00:06:52.040 --> 00:06:55.730
The Erie railroad was a very appealing target for anyone looking to invest.

120
00:06:55.731 --> 00:06:58.670
It was not only one of the longest railways in the country,

121
00:06:58.671 --> 00:07:00.890
but it also has a prime location.

122
00:07:01.100 --> 00:07:04.880
As it crossed New York state from New York city to Buffalo, despite this,

123
00:07:05.000 --> 00:07:08.630
it experienced financial troubles during the 1850s due to pull managements and

124
00:07:08.631 --> 00:07:13.190
large building costs and came Daniel drew one of the protagonists of the Aerie

125
00:07:13.191 --> 00:07:16.760
war. He was a financier who originally made his money from cattle,

126
00:07:16.761 --> 00:07:19.340
but how does fingers in many lucrative pies?

127
00:07:19.520 --> 00:07:21.890
He loans the struggling railroad $2 million,

128
00:07:21.891 --> 00:07:24.560
which ends in a place on the board of directors. Of course,

129
00:07:24.590 --> 00:07:26.570
this would have been only the beginning for drew.

130
00:07:26.780 --> 00:07:30.050
Was he fully intended to gain a controlling interest of the railroad,

131
00:07:30.080 --> 00:07:33.770
but he soon discovered that he had very stiff competition from Cornelius

132
00:07:33.771 --> 00:07:38.000
Vanderbilt, the richest man in America and someone we've already covered here on

133
00:07:38.001 --> 00:07:40.820
biographics. If you want to check his video out anyway, three,

134
00:07:40.821 --> 00:07:43.940
realize that he had little hope of going against Vanderbilt alone.

135
00:07:43.941 --> 00:07:45.410
So he found two partners.

136
00:07:45.440 --> 00:07:48.110
They were Jay Gould and another stockbroker named diamond.

137
00:07:48.111 --> 00:07:52.280
Jim James Fisk together, the three of them conspired to trick Vanderbilt.

138
00:07:52.310 --> 00:07:55.610
Since they knew that his intention was to corner the market and buy all of the

139
00:07:55.611 --> 00:07:58.790
available stock and the eerie railroad, they watered it down,

140
00:07:58.820 --> 00:08:02.390
meaning that they kept issuing additional stock and artificially inflating its

141
00:08:02.391 --> 00:08:05.930
value. This wasn't legal even back then. And in 1868,

142
00:08:06.080 --> 00:08:09.800
the three financier's that the flee New York city after a judge ended their

143
00:08:09.801 --> 00:08:14.270
activity and cited the entire board of directors of the area railroad to appear

144
00:08:14.271 --> 00:08:17.300
in court in a truly bizarre moments that the press ate up.

145
00:08:17.450 --> 00:08:21.320
The trio barricaded themselves in a New Jersey hotel in Todd bodyguards to

146
00:08:21.321 --> 00:08:23.030
protect the entrances around the clock.

147
00:08:23.180 --> 00:08:26.810
All they needed was to stall for time is they had an ACE up their sleeves.

148
00:08:26.900 --> 00:08:30.020
It was their connection to Tammany hall, the highly corrupt,

149
00:08:30.021 --> 00:08:34.370
highly influential democratic party political machine ruled by William boss,

150
00:08:34.371 --> 00:08:36.890
Tweed. He arranged for favorable legislation,

151
00:08:36.891 --> 00:08:41.060
which legalized their issue of stock in exchange for a director's position on

152
00:08:41.061 --> 00:08:42.200
the airy railroad.

153
00:08:42.201 --> 00:08:46.850
And certainly quite a lot of generous donations, journalist,

154
00:08:47.450 --> 00:08:49.400
Gustavo as Meyers who covered the scandal.

155
00:08:49.820 --> 00:08:53.450
Rotes how the New York politicians were equally accepting bribes from both

156
00:08:53.451 --> 00:08:57.630
groups and siding with the one paid the most writing members of the legislature.

157
00:08:58.380 --> 00:08:59.880
Impassively took money from both parties.

158
00:09:00.090 --> 00:09:04.440
Gould personally appeared at Albany with a central containing $500,000 in

159
00:09:04.441 --> 00:09:06.660
greenbacks, which were rapidly distributed.

160
00:09:06.720 --> 00:09:09.780
One Senator as was disclosed by an investigating committee,

161
00:09:10.410 --> 00:09:15.000
accepted $75,000 from Vanderbilt and then a hundred thousand dollars from Gould

162
00:09:15.150 --> 00:09:18.750
captured both sons and voted with the dominant gold forces.

163
00:09:18.840 --> 00:09:21.690
Exactly how the Erie war resolved itself is unclear.

164
00:09:21.870 --> 00:09:24.030
Eventually Vanderbilt and drew called a meeting.

165
00:09:24.031 --> 00:09:27.840
And it's reached an understanding with unknown terms. Vanderbilt backs off the,

166
00:09:28.050 --> 00:09:29.640
got the Erie railroad to buy backs,

167
00:09:29.670 --> 00:09:31.710
the watered down stocks that he had purchased.

168
00:09:31.950 --> 00:09:34.830
And just to show that there is truly no honor among thieves,

169
00:09:35.250 --> 00:09:38.970
Fisk and gold turned on very once. Vanderbilt was out of the picture in 1870,

170
00:09:38.971 --> 00:09:43.050
they again manipulated the stocks in such a way that their former partner lost

171
00:09:43.051 --> 00:09:47.070
money. It was data greatly affected by another financial crisis in 1873.

172
00:09:47.220 --> 00:09:48.600
And by 1876,

173
00:09:48.720 --> 00:09:52.050
he had been forced into retirement after having to declare bankruptcy.

174
00:09:52.170 --> 00:09:55.350
Daniel drew died in 1879, completely penniless.

175
00:09:55.380 --> 00:09:58.350
The second of Gold's partners to meet such a fate. Meanwhile,

176
00:09:58.351 --> 00:10:00.690
James Fisk had been murdered in 1872.

177
00:10:00.691 --> 00:10:04.560
While boss Tweed was imprisoned on multiple corruption charges as for Gould

178
00:10:04.561 --> 00:10:05.070
himself.

179
00:10:05.070 --> 00:10:09.600
He was also forced apart with the Erie railroad against his wishes in a way that

180
00:10:09.601 --> 00:10:10.560
nobody saw coming.

181
00:10:17.240 --> 00:10:20.720
And it wasn't another wealthy industrialist who got the best of G ghouls.

182
00:10:20.780 --> 00:10:22.130
It wasn't the authorities either.

183
00:10:22.280 --> 00:10:26.360
It was a con man who suckered gold out of a million dollars and almost caused

184
00:10:26.361 --> 00:10:29.840
Minnesota to invade Canada. His real name is lost to history,

185
00:10:29.870 --> 00:10:32.420
but he was known as Lord Gordon Gordon,

186
00:10:32.480 --> 00:10:36.350
his name scam involved portraying himself as a Scottish nobleman and obtaining

187
00:10:36.351 --> 00:10:38.270
goods and services on credit. Of course,

188
00:10:38.271 --> 00:10:41.150
eventually everybody called him the debt and the fraud was discovered.

189
00:10:41.151 --> 00:10:45.230
So this scheme required a constant change of scenery around 1817.

190
00:10:45.560 --> 00:10:48.230
Lord Gordon Gordon had been exposed as a fake in London.

191
00:10:48.231 --> 00:10:50.420
So he sought out greener pastures in America.

192
00:10:50.480 --> 00:10:54.470
He arrived in Minnesota where he posed as a Lord looking to invest lots of

193
00:10:54.471 --> 00:10:56.990
money, even deposited around $40,000.

194
00:10:56.991 --> 00:10:59.930
All the money left over from his previous swindles and a local bank.

195
00:10:59.990 --> 00:11:03.560
This was enough to convince everyone that he was legit and he soon made the

196
00:11:03.561 --> 00:11:07.130
acquaintance of officials from the Northern Pacific railroad who were looking

197
00:11:07.131 --> 00:11:10.550
for investors. They wines and Dines, Lord Gordon sparing,

198
00:11:10.551 --> 00:11:14.000
no expense in trying to persuade him to purchase the railroad land.

199
00:11:14.060 --> 00:11:15.680
Eventually he agreed to that DUNS,

200
00:11:15.710 --> 00:11:19.190
but said that he needed to travel to New York first to make arrangements for the

201
00:11:19.191 --> 00:11:20.030
money transfer.

202
00:11:20.240 --> 00:11:24.710
He left Minnesota never intending to return again with the people he called and

203
00:11:24.770 --> 00:11:26.870
smiling and waving goodbye.

204
00:11:28.070 --> 00:11:30.350
Gordon Gordon made an immediate splash in New York.

205
00:11:30.351 --> 00:11:33.440
He booked a lavish penthouse for himself and did letters of introduction from

206
00:11:33.441 --> 00:11:35.180
his former partners in Minnesota.

207
00:11:35.420 --> 00:11:38.780
So he quickly injected himself into the upper crust of society,

208
00:11:38.810 --> 00:11:40.700
through discussions with Horace Greeley,

209
00:11:40.701 --> 00:11:44.210
the founder and editor of the New York Tribune Gordon discovered that there was

210
00:11:44.211 --> 00:11:47.030
a power struggle going on for control of the Erie railroad.

211
00:11:47.120 --> 00:11:51.050
Somehow the Scottish Lord managed to convince greedy that he owned tens of

212
00:11:51.051 --> 00:11:52.970
thousands of stocks in that railroad,

213
00:11:53.560 --> 00:11:56.710
his European associates in that the word spread. And soon enough,

214
00:11:56.950 --> 00:11:58.630
he received a visit from Jay Gould.

215
00:11:58.690 --> 00:12:02.530
The American industrialist was already working on his own scheme to gain control

216
00:12:02.531 --> 00:12:03.281
of the railroad.

217
00:12:03.281 --> 00:12:07.870
And the last thing he needed was to have a European consortium come in and pull

218
00:12:07.871 --> 00:12:11.080
the rug from underneath him. He wanted to strike a deal with golden pool,

219
00:12:11.081 --> 00:12:14.800
their resources together Gould's takes control of the company and the Scottish

220
00:12:14.801 --> 00:12:18.820
nobleman names. The directors of his choosing to look after his interests,

221
00:12:19.150 --> 00:12:22.090
Lord Gordon pretended to be intrigued, but also reluctance.

222
00:12:22.300 --> 00:12:25.480
Why would he trust Jay ghouls? He asked for a guarantee,

223
00:12:25.750 --> 00:12:28.960
a million dollars and stocks and cash, not dispense,

224
00:12:28.970 --> 00:12:32.350
but to keep as a sign of good faith until that business was concluded,

225
00:12:32.500 --> 00:12:34.000
Gould immediately accepted.

226
00:12:34.001 --> 00:12:36.670
And it took him a while to realize that he had been cons.

227
00:12:36.671 --> 00:12:40.180
When Gordon began cashing in the stocks that theoretically,

228
00:12:40.330 --> 00:12:44.590
he said he wouldn't touch. He sued Gordon, took him to trial in March, 1873.

229
00:12:44.800 --> 00:12:48.340
He also contacted the Scottish aristocrats, alleged associates in Europe,

230
00:12:48.341 --> 00:12:51.790
who all said that, that never heard of this Lord Gordon Gordon.

231
00:12:51.970 --> 00:12:53.560
It would have been an easy conviction,

232
00:12:53.590 --> 00:12:57.610
but Gordon fled to Canada before being arrested. That was bad for Gould.

233
00:12:57.760 --> 00:13:01.060
Besides the money he had lost from the stocks Gordon had cashed in.

234
00:13:01.090 --> 00:13:03.640
He lost even more. Once word got out about the swing door,

235
00:13:03.641 --> 00:13:06.400
causing the value of the Erie railroad stocks to go down.

236
00:13:06.640 --> 00:13:10.030
But he wasn't the only one. He wanted to get his hands on Lord Gordon,

237
00:13:10.031 --> 00:13:14.320
because his targets from Minnesota also heard of the con man escaping across the

238
00:13:14.321 --> 00:13:18.370
border. It is uncertain exactly what role goals played and what happened next.

239
00:13:18.371 --> 00:13:22.390
But a group of prominent Minnesotans went to Canada and kidnaps Nord Gordon

240
00:13:22.391 --> 00:13:24.850
Gordon, hoping to bring him back to the States. However,

241
00:13:24.910 --> 00:13:28.510
they were caught at the border arrested and held without bail, Minnesota,

242
00:13:28.540 --> 00:13:29.373
governor Horace,

243
00:13:29.590 --> 00:13:33.010
Austin was ready to raise a militia and invade Canada in order to get his men

244
00:13:33.011 --> 00:13:35.050
released. It took intervention from us,

245
00:13:35.051 --> 00:13:38.620
president Ulysses S grant and Canadian prime minister, John MacDonald,

246
00:13:38.770 --> 00:13:40.750
to avoid an international incident.

247
00:13:40.780 --> 00:13:43.210
Once the extent of Gordon's crimes were established,

248
00:13:43.211 --> 00:13:45.310
the Canadian government degree do extradite him,

249
00:13:45.520 --> 00:13:49.480
but the con man committed suicide before this could happen. As for Jay ghouls,

250
00:13:49.481 --> 00:13:52.900
his connection to Lord Gordon Gordon had been a disaster ignoring the money he

251
00:13:52.901 --> 00:13:53.800
caused personally,

252
00:13:53.801 --> 00:13:57.550
the damage that he caused to the stock of the Erie railroad gave us opponents on

253
00:13:57.551 --> 00:13:58.990
the board of directors, all the Ana,

254
00:13:59.020 --> 00:14:03.100
they needed to force him out of the company. After all the years, the bribes,

255
00:14:03.160 --> 00:14:03.993
the betrayals,

256
00:14:04.000 --> 00:14:08.110
none of the participants in the Arie war got to enjoy the prize that,

257
00:14:08.111 --> 00:14:08.944
that fought so hard.

258
00:14:15.600 --> 00:14:16.110
<v 2>[Inaudible].</v>

259
00:14:16.110 --> 00:14:19.770
<v 0>Gold lost the Erie railroad. He did not abandon the industry altogether.</v>

260
00:14:19.830 --> 00:14:23.280
Instead he looked for new opportunities out West and still managed to amass,

261
00:14:23.281 --> 00:14:25.350
quite a large railroad empire for himself.

262
00:14:25.560 --> 00:14:27.900
He started by buying the union Pacific,

263
00:14:27.901 --> 00:14:30.900
which had been hurt dramatically by the panic of 1873.

264
00:14:30.960 --> 00:14:32.730
He then purchased a few other railways.

265
00:14:32.731 --> 00:14:36.120
You stock had plummeted and made repairs and improvements on all of them.

266
00:14:36.210 --> 00:14:39.810
Once the economy began to recover, he sold his stock for large profits.

267
00:14:39.840 --> 00:14:43.050
Besides transportation gold also got involved in communications,

268
00:14:43.051 --> 00:14:45.840
particularly Telegraph companies in 1875.

269
00:14:45.841 --> 00:14:48.330
He took over the Atlantic and Pacific Telegraph company.

270
00:14:48.331 --> 00:14:50.370
One of the main competitors to Western union.

271
00:14:50.580 --> 00:14:53.840
He then a rate war with all the other major companies,

272
00:14:53.841 --> 00:14:57.110
eventually selling a and P to Western union for another nice profit.

273
00:14:57.170 --> 00:14:58.100
This is all well and good,

274
00:14:58.130 --> 00:15:01.850
but it doesn't really have the scandal and controversies that we've come to

275
00:15:01.851 --> 00:15:03.890
expect from Gould's business ventures.

276
00:15:03.920 --> 00:15:07.940
For that we have to travel into the past just a bit to 1869 back when he was

277
00:15:07.941 --> 00:15:12.020
still partnered with James Fisk for all their shady wheelings and dealings.

278
00:15:12.170 --> 00:15:15.350
The two enacted a scheme to try and corner the gold market that involved the

279
00:15:15.830 --> 00:15:19.970
president of the United States himself and shook the foundations of the American

280
00:15:19.971 --> 00:15:24.230
economy. It became known as black Friday, the original black Friday, a term,

281
00:15:24.231 --> 00:15:28.400
which has since been used to refer to numerous disastrous events that occur on

282
00:15:28.401 --> 00:15:29.270
this day of the week.

283
00:15:29.330 --> 00:15:32.630
Golden Fisk had made the acquaintance of a man named Abel Corbett.

284
00:15:32.810 --> 00:15:35.300
He was a small time financier and speculator,

285
00:15:35.330 --> 00:15:38.780
but he also happens to be married to Virginia Grant sister,

286
00:15:39.020 --> 00:15:41.300
president Ulysses S grant through him,

287
00:15:41.301 --> 00:15:44.510
the doing that the presidents and entered his confidence back to then the

288
00:15:44.511 --> 00:15:45.710
country was still shaky.

289
00:15:45.711 --> 00:15:48.980
Following the civil war as part of its plan to help stabilize the dollar to

290
00:15:48.981 --> 00:15:49.850
boost the economy.

291
00:15:49.970 --> 00:15:54.020
Grants enacted a policy where the us treasury would regularly sell gold at a

292
00:15:54.021 --> 00:15:56.030
discount for dollars. During this time,

293
00:15:56.060 --> 00:15:59.600
golden Fisk had been buying quite a lot of gold on the open market,

294
00:15:59.630 --> 00:16:00.141
but of course,

295
00:16:00.141 --> 00:16:03.110
as long as it was available at a discount to the value of their investment would

296
00:16:03.111 --> 00:16:06.380
stay low. What they needed was for the government to stop selling gold.

297
00:16:06.500 --> 00:16:08.060
So there'd be a bigger demand for it.

298
00:16:08.180 --> 00:16:12.680
After being introduced by Corbin golden Fisk casually brought up the subject of

299
00:16:12.681 --> 00:16:15.470
gold with president grounds at various social gatherings.

300
00:16:15.740 --> 00:16:18.230
They both argued against the government set of gold.

301
00:16:18.231 --> 00:16:20.540
And of course they were backed by Abel Corban.

302
00:16:20.570 --> 00:16:24.290
They also had a man on the inside then general Daniel Butterfield who was

303
00:16:24.291 --> 00:16:27.950
assistant treasurer and informs them when the government was getting ready to

304
00:16:27.951 --> 00:16:31.640
sell all the pieces were in place to make a killing on the gold market.

305
00:16:32.210 --> 00:16:34.100
Golden Fisk, amassed, mass, large supply of gold.

306
00:16:34.101 --> 00:16:35.930
And when the treasury stopped selling,

307
00:16:35.960 --> 00:16:38.600
they just sat back and watched the value of their investment.

308
00:16:38.690 --> 00:16:40.250
Go through the roof. Of course,

309
00:16:40.251 --> 00:16:43.580
they intended to unload it right before the treasury started selling against and

310
00:16:43.581 --> 00:16:46.430
maximize their profits. But that plan backfired.

311
00:16:46.550 --> 00:16:50.090
Eventually grant realized he had been swindled and ordered the immediate sale of

312
00:16:50.091 --> 00:16:51.530
$4 million in gold.

313
00:16:51.590 --> 00:16:55.160
This caused the value of the precious metal diplomas plunging the entire stock

314
00:16:55.161 --> 00:16:59.660
market into chaos. This happens on September the 24th, 1869, a date,

315
00:16:59.780 --> 00:17:02.030
which became known as black Friday,

316
00:17:02.390 --> 00:17:04.730
many speculators and investors were ruins that day.

317
00:17:04.731 --> 00:17:06.740
But golden Fisk made out nicely.

318
00:17:06.770 --> 00:17:10.220
They heard of Grant's plan from Butterfields and had time to sell off most of

319
00:17:10.221 --> 00:17:13.220
their gold reserves. They also avoided any legal repercussions,

320
00:17:13.250 --> 00:17:15.920
partly because they were smart in how they carried out their scheme.

321
00:17:15.921 --> 00:17:20.180
But mainly because they were tried in New York where they were protected by

322
00:17:20.181 --> 00:17:22.580
friendly judges who were associates of boss, Tweed

323
00:17:29.410 --> 00:17:32.560
Talked about Jay Gould's private life so far because there was nothing

324
00:17:32.561 --> 00:17:36.610
spectacular. As I mentioned, he married Helen J. Miller in 1863,

325
00:17:36.611 --> 00:17:38.350
when they were both in their mid twenties,

326
00:17:38.500 --> 00:17:41.590
they had six children together who did what you would expect for that time

327
00:17:41.591 --> 00:17:42.130
period.

328
00:17:42.130 --> 00:17:46.150
The men became businessmen and investors like their father and the women became

329
00:17:46.151 --> 00:17:50.520
socialites and philanthropists gold contracted in 1892.

330
00:17:50.521 --> 00:17:54.900
What we today called tuberculosis. And he died on December. The second age,

331
00:17:54.930 --> 00:17:59.130
56, his wealth was placed at around $72 million at the time of his death.

332
00:17:59.160 --> 00:18:02.550
Although more recent estimates claimed that it was closer to a hundred million
