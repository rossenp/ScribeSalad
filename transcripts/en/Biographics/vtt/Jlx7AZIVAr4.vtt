You'll also get 20 point percent off the cost of full membership,

4
00:00:10.510 --> 00:00:11.480
more on them in a bit,

5
00:00:17.420 --> 00:00:21.670
You probably know the old saying some are born to greatness while others have

6
00:00:21.671 --> 00:00:24.630
greatness thrust upon them. During the years we've been making these videos.

7
00:00:24.631 --> 00:00:27.550
We've covered hundreds of men and women who fall into both categories.

8
00:00:27.680 --> 00:00:31.150
We've even covered plenty of people for whom greatness meant doing something

9
00:00:31.151 --> 00:00:34.510
consequential, but awful, your Stalins and your mouths.

10
00:00:34.511 --> 00:00:37.910
What about those whose destiny isn't to be anywhere close to greatness.

11
00:00:38.080 --> 00:00:42.220
Those who were born to while had mediocrity thrust upon them only for that

12
00:00:42.230 --> 00:00:44.940
mediocrity to itself older history for Charles Cormo.

13
00:00:44.941 --> 00:00:46.500
This wasn't an abstract question.

14
00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:49.740
It was his very life born into the English upper classes.

15
00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:53.820
KOMO had the misfortune of embarking on a military career just as England's

16
00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:56.180
American colonies. As he exploded in revolt,

17
00:00:56.340 --> 00:00:58.780
promoted above his head and shipped out to fight.

18
00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:01.850
He wounds up being the red coats commands are at York town.

19
00:01:01.851 --> 00:01:06.490
Whereas surrender ended the revolutionary war and insured Britain forever lost

20
00:01:06.550 --> 00:01:10.770
her 13 colonies in today's video. We're examining the life of a mostly decent,

21
00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:12.610
but a useless man,

22
00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:16.850
a useless man who somehow still managed to change the world.

23
00:01:23.470 --> 00:01:27.000
When Charles Cormo was born on December the 31st, 1738,

24
00:01:27.140 --> 00:01:30.800
it was into a family that was spectacularly well connected.

25
00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:34.480
His grandfather was brother-in-law of the great Robert WPA while his father

26
00:01:34.610 --> 00:01:37.400
would soon be made both an Earl and VI counts.

27
00:01:37.540 --> 00:01:40.000
The family also stood in good grace with the monarchy,

28
00:01:40.070 --> 00:01:44.390
despite likely having Cornish Irish roots that corn Wallaces were famously loyal

29
00:01:44.410 --> 00:01:45.243
to the British throne.

30
00:01:45.330 --> 00:01:47.870
It was a trait that Charles would inherit and won that would land him in a lot

31
00:01:47.871 --> 00:01:48.910
of trouble. But now though,

32
00:01:48.911 --> 00:01:52.830
young Charles enjoyed a regulation childhood among the English upper classes,

33
00:01:53.060 --> 00:01:57.590
attending Eaton with future Dukes and learning about military glory.

34
00:01:57.810 --> 00:02:00.190
The boy evidently liked what he learns as a teenager.

35
00:02:00.410 --> 00:02:04.340
His fascination with war was intense even by the standards of the time,

36
00:02:04.410 --> 00:02:05.660
despite having a body shape,

37
00:02:05.680 --> 00:02:10.420
we might charitably call unlike Chris Hemsworth and suffering skewed vision

38
00:02:10.421 --> 00:02:11.420
from a sporting injury.

39
00:02:11.820 --> 00:02:14.460
Kamal was determined to one day fight for king and country.

40
00:02:15.220 --> 00:02:18.900
That day came sooner than he expected in August, 1756,

41
00:02:18.901 --> 00:02:21.460
just as Charles was enrolling at Cambridge Frederick.

42
00:02:21.800 --> 00:02:25.410
The great of pressure in did sate for the past two years.

43
00:02:25.411 --> 00:02:29.490
America's British and French colonists said been fighting one another in the

44
00:02:29.491 --> 00:02:30.530
French and Indian war.

45
00:02:30.600 --> 00:02:35.210
Frederick's a great attack on a French ally in Europe was the opening of a whole

46
00:02:35.350 --> 00:02:37.130
new theater of combat with Britain.

47
00:02:37.310 --> 00:02:40.290
Now allied with Prussia in this increasingly global conflict,

48
00:02:40.320 --> 00:02:44.800
Charles decided to ditch his studies and become the soldier that it always

49
00:02:44.801 --> 00:02:47.960
dreamed of being from 1757 to 1761,

50
00:02:47.961 --> 00:02:51.720
Charles corn Wallace toward Europe with the Prussian army fighting in some of

51
00:02:51.721 --> 00:02:55.360
the biggest battles of his era. And he clearly made an impression by the end,

52
00:02:55.361 --> 00:02:58.000
he was promoted to left tenant Colonel even before the fighting finished,

53
00:02:58.020 --> 00:03:02.160
he was able to translate his military glory into a seat in Britain's house of

54
00:03:02.161 --> 00:03:06.240
commons. Not that it needed for very long in June, 1762,

55
00:03:06.241 --> 00:03:10.120
his father died and Charles inherited his album a year later as the seven years

56
00:03:10.140 --> 00:03:14.200
war finally drew to a close. He took his dad's seat in the house of Lords,

57
00:03:14.760 --> 00:03:17.120
stronger by word for stuffy conservatism.

58
00:03:17.260 --> 00:03:20.910
The Lord's nonetheless had a handful of liberal ish members,

59
00:03:21.340 --> 00:03:24.670
even in koala's day known as the rocking mites after their leader,

60
00:03:24.740 --> 00:03:25.590
Lord Rockingham,

61
00:03:25.740 --> 00:03:30.470
they managed to recruit the new L just as politics got very interesting being on

62
00:03:30.471 --> 00:03:33.190
the winning side of the seven years, war had been great for Britain standing,

63
00:03:33.370 --> 00:03:37.150
but it had been terrible for its finances since expelling the French from

64
00:03:37.151 --> 00:03:39.980
America. It primarily benefited the 13 colonies.

65
00:03:39.981 --> 00:03:43.380
It was decided the colonists could refill the King's coffers.

66
00:03:43.560 --> 00:03:48.020
And so we come to the infamous stamp act attacks on all paper and printed

67
00:03:48.220 --> 00:03:51.620
materials in the colonies. The stamp act was kind of like George III,

68
00:03:51.621 --> 00:03:56.380
personally, slapping every American about the face with a bit of a freely glove.

69
00:03:56.640 --> 00:04:01.170
It was also the stupidest thing that Ko Wallace had ever heard of in the Lord's

70
00:04:01.330 --> 00:04:04.770
con Wallace became a passionate enemy of the stamp act believing it's unfair on

71
00:04:04.771 --> 00:04:07.890
the Americans when Lord Rockingham became prime minister and repealed,

72
00:04:07.891 --> 00:04:10.530
the act con Wallace was one of those who cheered the loudest,

73
00:04:10.670 --> 00:04:13.330
but Rockingham also passed the declaratory act,

74
00:04:13.331 --> 00:04:16.570
which basically said to the Americans, okay, finally, won't ask you now,

75
00:04:16.630 --> 00:04:19.810
but we absolutely have the right to only five peers.

76
00:04:19.970 --> 00:04:24.640
The ed against this new also dumb law among them was Charles KWA. Yet,

77
00:04:24.641 --> 00:04:26.320
while he cared about all this politics,

78
00:04:26.321 --> 00:04:28.360
wasn't Charles corn Wallace's life blood.

79
00:04:28.361 --> 00:04:32.280
It wasn't what made him get out of bed in the morning in 1768,

80
00:04:32.340 --> 00:04:35.800
he was ready to retire from the Lords and settle down with his new wife Jemima.

81
00:04:36.150 --> 00:04:38.400
This would be the happiest period of his life.

82
00:04:39.080 --> 00:04:42.190
Jemima was the daughter of a soldier, a far below Ko Wallace's class,

83
00:04:42.370 --> 00:04:43.630
but it married her for love.

84
00:04:43.631 --> 00:04:48.470
And the two soon settled into a blisful and boring domestic life

85
00:04:48.610 --> 00:04:51.510
as the years passed. And the two became parents and grew fat.

86
00:04:51.820 --> 00:04:55.150
It's just about possible to see how things could have turned out differently.

87
00:04:55.510 --> 00:04:59.950
A world in which Charles KOMO was only ever an obscure happy nobody,

88
00:05:00.210 --> 00:05:04.700
but unfortunately, Charles did not live in that world. In this world.

89
00:05:04.920 --> 00:05:09.300
He was destined to not be forgotten, but to go down in infa

90
00:05:15.430 --> 00:05:18.220
While Charles KWA was happily slipping into retirements,

91
00:05:18.240 --> 00:05:21.500
the British governments was happily pouring gasoline onto the,

92
00:05:21.850 --> 00:05:25.530
the stamp act dumpster fire just a year after the declar react,

93
00:05:25.630 --> 00:05:29.890
the Townsend act that slapped duties on British exports to the colonies.

94
00:05:29.920 --> 00:05:31.890
This has led to a boycot on British goods,

95
00:05:31.891 --> 00:05:35.410
which had in turn led to British soldiers being sent to Boston culminating in

96
00:05:35.411 --> 00:05:36.290
the Boston massacre.

97
00:05:36.360 --> 00:05:39.890
When soldiers fired into a mob killing five in the wake of this parliament had

98
00:05:39.891 --> 00:05:43.320
repealed the Townsend act and decided to stop the are being unfair taxes on the

99
00:05:43.321 --> 00:05:45.920
Americans once. And for all, not, not really.

100
00:05:46.240 --> 00:05:48.960
You are vaguely familiar with history that of course didn't happen. Instead,

101
00:05:48.961 --> 00:05:52.280
you had the T act of 1773, which led to the Boston tea party.

102
00:05:52.340 --> 00:05:55.360
And then the intolerable acts by which point the 13 colonies had basically

103
00:05:55.361 --> 00:05:59.120
become a bit of a powder keg. Finally, on April the 18th, 1775,

104
00:05:59.121 --> 00:06:03.960
British troops lit the match by marching out to sea weapons held in Concord,

105
00:06:04.280 --> 00:06:06.800
Bon Rouge. They bumped into a waiting militia in Lexington.

106
00:06:06.801 --> 00:06:10.680
Someone fired a shortens. The rest is history that you are familiar with. Okay,

107
00:06:10.681 --> 00:06:13.000
so now we've recapped third grade American history class.

108
00:06:13.001 --> 00:06:16.950
It's starting to check back in on corn Morris, despite having been par guy,

109
00:06:16.951 --> 00:06:19.150
most likely to make love heart signs in America.

110
00:06:19.210 --> 00:06:20.710
The moment the revolution broke out,

111
00:06:20.910 --> 00:06:23.830
Ko Wallace defaulted back to his king and country mode.

112
00:06:24.110 --> 00:06:25.190
Although his wife begged him not to,

113
00:06:25.191 --> 00:06:28.270
he volunteered to fight and was promoted to major general and shipped out on

114
00:06:28.470 --> 00:06:31.070
February the 12th, 1776 on may the third,

115
00:06:31.290 --> 00:06:33.070
his ship made landfall in North Carolina.

116
00:06:33.450 --> 00:06:37.780
At this point in the story Ko Wallace met his lifelong nemesis, sir,

117
00:06:37.790 --> 00:06:38.660
Henry Clinton,

118
00:06:38.880 --> 00:06:41.500
the man who would eventually had all the British forces in the colonies.

119
00:06:41.500 --> 00:06:44.140
Clinton was a sensitive, moody, envious, incompetent,

120
00:06:44.540 --> 00:06:48.940
entitled scrub of commander from almost the moment they met Clinton and corn

121
00:06:49.180 --> 00:06:51.780
Wallace regarded one another with a mutual LOA thing,

122
00:06:51.860 --> 00:06:54.900
a LOA thing that would eventually deteriorate into outright hostility.

123
00:06:55.080 --> 00:06:56.540
But in those early days,

124
00:06:56.680 --> 00:06:59.930
the British could ill pretends that this was just teething problems.

125
00:07:00.030 --> 00:07:03.330
As corn Wallace was sent north to reinforce the William, how in New York,

126
00:07:03.510 --> 00:07:07.130
it even looks like the war might be over before it properly began that summer

127
00:07:07.410 --> 00:07:10.170
corn Wallace commanded the reserve troops in the battle of long island,

128
00:07:10.370 --> 00:07:13.810
a cataclysmic defeat that saw George Washington lose New York city to the

129
00:07:13.811 --> 00:07:14.770
British. Although William,

130
00:07:15.090 --> 00:07:19.280
how let the American general slip through his fingers Kowa certain they'd catch

131
00:07:19.480 --> 00:07:19.721
him soon.

132
00:07:19.721 --> 00:07:22.680
Unfortunately it quickly became clear that slipping through fingers was

133
00:07:22.681 --> 00:07:26.480
something Washington was rather good at the next six months of koala's life

134
00:07:26.490 --> 00:07:29.840
reads like the synopsis for a rejected road rhino cartoon,

135
00:07:30.060 --> 00:07:33.320
in which Wiley coyote briefly commands a major part of the British army.

136
00:07:33.450 --> 00:07:35.560
There was the battle of Fort Lee in November,

137
00:07:35.561 --> 00:07:39.230
which ended with koalas forced to chase the slippery Washington all over the

138
00:07:39.231 --> 00:07:39.740
state.

139
00:07:39.740 --> 00:07:43.270
Then there was corn Wallace's inexplicable decision to let Washington go after

140
00:07:43.271 --> 00:07:46.990
finally capturing up with him a moment that may have cost the British the war.

141
00:07:47.020 --> 00:07:49.910
Finally, there was what happened at Trenton on January the second,

142
00:07:50.350 --> 00:07:54.270
1777 after marching a whole day to catch Washington corn Wallace allowed his men

143
00:07:54.271 --> 00:07:58.230
to sleep rather than immediately fought a Cree can do battle stupidly.

144
00:07:58.231 --> 00:07:59.540
He forgot to post look out.

145
00:07:59.560 --> 00:08:03.500
So Washington simply waited until nightfall and then road runner away. Again,

146
00:08:03.501 --> 00:08:08.380
leaving Ko Wallace's reputation to plunge wi coyote like into a bottomless pit.

147
00:08:08.650 --> 00:08:10.820
When Clintons got the news of this BL he remarked,

148
00:08:10.821 --> 00:08:15.740
it was the most consummate ignorance I ever heard of in any officer above a

149
00:08:15.900 --> 00:08:19.340
corporal as all soon to see though Clintons was himself, no slouch at I,

150
00:08:19.710 --> 00:08:23.050
and Kawas also did at least have one thing going for him throughout all the wars

151
00:08:23.130 --> 00:08:26.330
that ever been involved with thel would do his best to make sure his man were

152
00:08:26.331 --> 00:08:28.970
well fed paid on time and not made to suffer.

153
00:08:29.240 --> 00:08:33.410
It's here that we see one of these sad contradictions of kas's life.

154
00:08:33.550 --> 00:08:36.410
Up to a certain point. He was a competent man with a humane streak,

155
00:08:36.440 --> 00:08:39.010
rare for his class. Had he been a bit less privileged?

156
00:08:39.011 --> 00:08:42.280
He would've made a fine logistics commander or lower ranking officer,

157
00:08:42.500 --> 00:08:45.120
but this was the 18th century in era, in British history.

158
00:08:45.150 --> 00:08:47.640
When background was valued above ability,

159
00:08:48.160 --> 00:08:51.520
poor Charles Gowa was gonna keep failing upwards until it killed him.

160
00:08:51.660 --> 00:08:54.600
And as you know, perhaps Al Kowa might have failed a little less.

161
00:08:54.620 --> 00:08:59.120
If he had quick and easy access to the greatest wisdom of his time,

162
00:08:59.380 --> 00:09:02.440
he didn't have blinks because it was the 18th century and books were still being

163
00:09:02.441 --> 00:09:06.320
written with feathers back then. But you, you have no excuse. Look,

164
00:09:06.321 --> 00:09:09.640
if you are like me, you've got plans to read lots of new books this year,

165
00:09:09.641 --> 00:09:10.600
because well,

166
00:09:10.780 --> 00:09:14.790
you want to enter that sweet bank of knowledge that you keep in your big rain.

167
00:09:14.790 --> 00:09:17.510
Unfortunately, reading takes time and energy and detention,

168
00:09:17.910 --> 00:09:21.510
all things that we're all lacking. Fortunately though, I have Blinkus.

169
00:09:21.511 --> 00:09:23.750
This is an app that offers easily digestible,

170
00:09:23.751 --> 00:09:26.110
15 minute summaries of the best non-fiction books.

171
00:09:26.140 --> 00:09:30.190
There's more than 3000 of them. You can either read or listen. Personally,

172
00:09:30.191 --> 00:09:32.190
I listen about 90% of the time, just like a podcast.

173
00:09:32.500 --> 00:09:34.270
It's easier to fit into my day. That way,

174
00:09:34.550 --> 00:09:38.540
while mindless things like going to work or cleaning the kitchen or folding the

175
00:09:38.541 --> 00:09:39.980
laundry, that sort of stuff.

176
00:09:40.540 --> 00:09:43.940
14 million active users are currently using blinkers to get the best insights

177
00:09:43.941 --> 00:09:47.740
and need to know info from thousands of books from self-help to business,

178
00:09:47.880 --> 00:09:49.940
to health, whatever you're into it's on there.

179
00:09:50.260 --> 00:09:52.060
Before example on my blinkers list for 2021,

180
00:09:52.100 --> 00:09:54.860
I have how luck happens by Janice Kaplan and Barnaby marsh.

181
00:09:55.180 --> 00:09:57.810
It's a whole book on how to create luck for yourself,

182
00:09:57.811 --> 00:10:00.610
distill down into a 13 minute package.

183
00:10:01.030 --> 00:10:04.170
So if you are interested in learning big ideas in small packages,

184
00:10:04.240 --> 00:10:08.130
head to blinkers.com/biographics where the first hundred people will get one

185
00:10:08.131 --> 00:10:09.290
week to try it out for free.

186
00:10:09.291 --> 00:10:12.970
You'll also get 25% off if you want the full membership and let's get back to Ko

187
00:10:13.170 --> 00:10:14.003
Wallace

188
00:10:19.960 --> 00:10:24.160
Comic as the images of con Wallace, as some kind of dufus cartoon coyote,

189
00:10:24.300 --> 00:10:27.200
we don't want you to go away thinking he was completely useless.

190
00:10:27.260 --> 00:10:31.040
The key takeaway is that he was average an average guy in a position that

191
00:10:31.041 --> 00:10:32.960
required someone well above average,

192
00:10:33.340 --> 00:10:36.480
but even the mediocre have occasional moments of greatness.

193
00:10:37.470 --> 00:10:39.670
Kowas came at the battle of Brandy wine.

194
00:10:39.850 --> 00:10:42.910
Brandy wine is notorious today as Washington's biggest screwup,

195
00:10:42.930 --> 00:10:44.030
but from the British perspective,

196
00:10:44.330 --> 00:10:47.950
it was a triumph taking place on September the 11th, 1777.

197
00:10:48.130 --> 00:10:52.870
It saw William how and Kowas launch a dual attack on Washington troops under the

198
00:10:52.871 --> 00:10:56.870
cover of fog. Assuming how's division was the entire British force.

199
00:10:57.060 --> 00:10:59.220
Washington left his right flank, clear,

200
00:10:59.460 --> 00:11:01.980
open only for Kawas to come crashing into it.

201
00:11:02.080 --> 00:11:06.180
The continental army suffered over 1,100 casualties compared to just 600 for the

202
00:11:06.181 --> 00:11:08.300
British, although Washington, again, rode runner away.

203
00:11:08.320 --> 00:11:10.900
He lost all of his artillery pieces and Philadelphia,

204
00:11:11.030 --> 00:11:15.380
which now lay wide open for Kawas. The sneak attack was a huge personal victory.

205
00:11:15.480 --> 00:11:18.530
He was even allowed time off that Christmas to go were home and see his wife.

206
00:11:18.670 --> 00:11:21.890
We can only hope he enjoyed it because that Christmas would be the last normal

207
00:11:21.950 --> 00:11:23.770
one that Charles ever spent with his family.

208
00:11:24.150 --> 00:11:29.130
The following winter Jemima was taken ill. She died on February the 16th, 1779.

209
00:11:29.131 --> 00:11:32.570
Thanks to emergency leave. Cole Wallace made it home just in time to see her,

210
00:11:32.670 --> 00:11:35.450
but with the war still raging, he had no time to mourn.

211
00:11:35.600 --> 00:11:39.360
Instead he had to pack back up and return to his domestic life in England,

212
00:11:39.420 --> 00:11:42.320
no longer something to look forward to just a happy memory.

213
00:11:42.900 --> 00:11:45.640
One of HAPPI at times, back in the colonies,

214
00:11:45.660 --> 00:11:48.320
the war was moving inexorably against the British,

215
00:11:48.580 --> 00:11:50.200
the French and Spanish were now involved.

216
00:11:50.201 --> 00:11:53.280
The Americans had refused to surrender after Philadelphia fell.

217
00:11:53.460 --> 00:11:57.920
And Henry Clintons was now overall British commander with predictably credit

218
00:11:57.950 --> 00:12:01.920
results. So koalas decided to change tack in May, 1780.

219
00:12:01.940 --> 00:12:05.000
He headed into South Carolina, the head of a vast fighting force,

220
00:12:05.520 --> 00:12:09.120
determined to open a new front Charlestown fell quickly as did other keys,

221
00:12:09.360 --> 00:12:13.110
strategic points before long koalas had effectively taken control of the entire

222
00:12:13.120 --> 00:12:13.540
state.

223
00:12:13.540 --> 00:12:16.950
When general gates attempted to retake the town of Camden for the Continentals,

224
00:12:17.230 --> 00:12:20.950
Kamal even managed to win another great victory killing or capturing nearly 2000

225
00:12:20.951 --> 00:12:25.590
Americans while losing only 300 of his own men come full of 1780 Kamal was

226
00:12:25.591 --> 00:12:29.270
secure in South Carolina. Had he been his dream to rule the state as a warlord?

227
00:12:29.370 --> 00:12:32.910
It would've been pretty happy, but of course that hadn't been koala's gold.

228
00:12:33.080 --> 00:12:35.340
He wanted to take North Carolina too,

229
00:12:35.570 --> 00:12:39.500
then March into Virginia and link up with Clinton army like so many dreams.

230
00:12:39.520 --> 00:12:42.100
It would prove to be beyond Charles corn Wallace's reach.

231
00:12:42.270 --> 00:12:44.460
North Carolina was not South Carolina.

232
00:12:44.520 --> 00:12:48.300
The mini civil war between Patriots and loyalists was more bitter here.

233
00:12:48.360 --> 00:12:50.980
The terrain less friendly in January, 1781,

234
00:12:50.981 --> 00:12:54.810
the battle of pens saw many of corn's best soldiers killed or captured.

235
00:12:54.870 --> 00:12:55.703
Two months later,

236
00:12:55.770 --> 00:12:58.970
Kawa squared off against an Nathaniel green at the battle of Gilford courthouse

237
00:12:58.990 --> 00:13:02.890
and managed to rack our technical victory that costs so many of his remaining

238
00:13:02.891 --> 00:13:05.810
soldiers that you might as well call it at a defeat by now,

239
00:13:05.811 --> 00:13:09.730
the great victory at Brandy wine must have seemed like very long ago.

240
00:13:09.800 --> 00:13:14.480
Even the battle of Camden was three quarters of a year past still Kawas gamely

241
00:13:14.481 --> 00:13:17.720
pushed on marching up into Virginia, despite North Carolina,

242
00:13:17.860 --> 00:13:20.440
not yet being pacified in may of 1781,

243
00:13:20.500 --> 00:13:22.640
his exhausted men finally reached the James river.

244
00:13:22.980 --> 00:13:25.080
At which point they received the fateful order.

245
00:13:25.360 --> 00:13:27.280
A message from Clinton came demanding, Ko Wallace,

246
00:13:27.720 --> 00:13:30.480
establish a fortified base at either Williamsburg or Yorktown.

247
00:13:30.620 --> 00:13:32.120
As far as KOMO was concerned,

248
00:13:32.150 --> 00:13:34.790
this was like Clinton asking him to choose between a kicking,

249
00:13:34.850 --> 00:13:37.750
the nuts and erectile inserted cactus.

250
00:13:38.020 --> 00:13:40.590
Neither was particularly pleasant to contemplate,

251
00:13:40.730 --> 00:13:44.230
but orders were orders with what we can only imagine was a pain sigh.

252
00:13:44.231 --> 00:13:46.670
The Earl chose the kick in the nuts that was Yorktown.

253
00:13:47.350 --> 00:13:48.790
All did poor Charles Kawa know it,

254
00:13:48.890 --> 00:13:53.390
but it soon be wishing had chosen the prickly comforting cactus in Williamsberg.

255
00:13:53.460 --> 00:13:54.293
Instead,

256
00:14:00.320 --> 00:14:02.100
The moment Kowas settled in Yorktown,

257
00:14:02.101 --> 00:14:05.340
the revolutionary war was basically over the French and most of the Americans

258
00:14:05.341 --> 00:14:07.460
immediately realized the British was sitting ducks.

259
00:14:07.740 --> 00:14:09.940
Although Washington initially ignored it as a side show,

260
00:14:10.000 --> 00:14:11.740
he eventually realized its significance.

261
00:14:11.840 --> 00:14:16.450
The only person who never figured it out was he Tinson in SCO New York.

262
00:14:16.451 --> 00:14:20.170
Clinton was certain Washington was going to attack him so certain that when he

263
00:14:20.171 --> 00:14:24.210
received a pathetic plea from Cornwell begging for more troops, he ignored it.

264
00:14:24.350 --> 00:14:27.650
But Washington was already making plans to head south for the final battle.

265
00:14:27.910 --> 00:14:29.010
On September the 28th,

266
00:14:29.110 --> 00:14:32.130
the combined American French force began its assault on Yorktown.

267
00:14:32.310 --> 00:14:36.600
As the siege trenches with Duggan's. The artillery began Cornwell that tight,

268
00:14:36.820 --> 00:14:38.160
barely bothering to give orders.

269
00:14:38.430 --> 00:14:41.080
It's possibly thought Clintons was coming to rescue him more.

270
00:14:41.220 --> 00:14:45.200
He may have just realized how hopeless his position was on October the 14th.

271
00:14:45.420 --> 00:14:47.920
The first assault began in his last act of competence.

272
00:14:48.280 --> 00:14:50.760
Komal began faring his men to safety across the James river.

273
00:14:50.820 --> 00:14:54.840
He got a thousand of them over before a storm blew up and ended impossible

274
00:14:55.520 --> 00:14:57.040
escape cut off. There was nothing to do,

275
00:14:57.340 --> 00:15:00.760
but wait for the end at 11:00 AM on October the 19th, 1781,

276
00:15:00.761 --> 00:15:03.120
the British surrendered Yorktown. It was, uh,

277
00:15:03.121 --> 00:15:06.440
frankly pathetic ends as the red coats marched out.

278
00:15:06.441 --> 00:15:08.960
They acknowledged the French battalions, but ignored.

279
00:15:08.961 --> 00:15:12.710
The American troops Kas refused to meet Washington for the formal surrender.

280
00:15:12.780 --> 00:15:16.830
Instead sending an assistance. It was a cheap last minute snub,

281
00:15:17.130 --> 00:15:21.190
but it didn't change the fact that the man he was snobbing had just handed Ko

282
00:15:21.710 --> 00:15:23.950
Wallace's Yorktown ended the revolutionary war.

283
00:15:23.951 --> 00:15:27.870
Thanks to a combination of Clinton's poor leadership and Ko Wallace's painfully

284
00:15:27.871 --> 00:15:30.790
mediocre performance. The British were knocked out of the fight.

285
00:15:31.160 --> 00:15:34.740
Of course the winds had been blowing in that direction for a very long time.

286
00:15:34.810 --> 00:15:38.820
It's not like Kom Wallace was single handedly responsible for the British losing

287
00:15:38.840 --> 00:15:41.780
the war, but he also didn't do much to help them win.

288
00:15:41.960 --> 00:15:45.500
Had he been just a bit more talented, a bit more daring, a bit more? Well,

289
00:15:45.900 --> 00:15:49.740
anything really well over six years of fighting that could have really added up

290
00:15:50.100 --> 00:15:52.690
a few more Brandy wines here. Another Camden there,

291
00:15:52.930 --> 00:15:56.330
and the history of America might look very different despite his major role in

292
00:15:56.331 --> 00:15:57.730
losing the 13 colonies though,

293
00:15:58.210 --> 00:16:00.050
koalas didn't return to Britain under a cloud of shame.

294
00:16:00.350 --> 00:16:04.050
The view in London was that he was a good loyal soldier. And more importantly,

295
00:16:04.210 --> 00:16:07.450
a gentleman, one who'd been put in an impossible position.

296
00:16:07.670 --> 00:16:10.610
All of which is why within seven months of the disaster at Yorktown,

297
00:16:10.611 --> 00:16:14.200
Charles kals was offered mil tree control of British India. I know, right?

298
00:16:14.201 --> 00:16:18.040
This guy's literally just proven himself to be super UN excellent at this.

299
00:16:18.100 --> 00:16:20.600
And here's the British establishment being all like, yeah,

300
00:16:20.800 --> 00:16:23.040
you wanna try something even bigger? I mean, why not?

301
00:16:23.340 --> 00:16:27.480
At least Ko Wallace himself had the brains to say no something he kept saying

302
00:16:27.580 --> 00:16:29.280
for four whole years,

303
00:16:29.700 --> 00:16:32.830
you can't have people falling upwards without the complicity of everyone else

304
00:16:33.070 --> 00:16:36.710
though. In February of 1786, after years of controlling by prime minister pit,

305
00:16:36.711 --> 00:16:38.510
the younger Kamal finally agreed.

306
00:16:38.570 --> 00:16:41.750
He had only one request still smarting about Clinton's dumb orders,

307
00:16:42.230 --> 00:16:42.831
Kamal demanded.

308
00:16:42.831 --> 00:16:47.030
He be given total control of the subcontinent and Pitre so rather than retiring

309
00:16:47.031 --> 00:16:49.510
into obscurity, Kamal sailed off for India.

310
00:16:49.970 --> 00:16:54.380
So would he go any better than America did? What do you think

311
00:17:00.640 --> 00:17:04.940
The India Charles Kowa arrived in was undergoing a seismic change in its

312
00:17:04.941 --> 00:17:08.700
relationship with Britain until recently the east India company had almost free

313
00:17:08.980 --> 00:17:12.300
reign over its territories. It was in 1784 that put the younger,

314
00:17:12.301 --> 00:17:16.330
made the company former subservient to the crown as such British rule was driven

315
00:17:16.331 --> 00:17:21.210
with corruption and beset by local waring Saltan and it was Kamal's job to

316
00:17:21.240 --> 00:17:22.073
sort it all out.

317
00:17:22.270 --> 00:17:26.850
His success would be qualified to say the least for Kamal corruption was

318
00:17:26.851 --> 00:17:28.130
synonymous with natives.

319
00:17:28.131 --> 00:17:30.970
So he decided to kick them all out of the colonial administration,

320
00:17:31.200 --> 00:17:33.250
declaring every native of Hindustan.

321
00:17:33.410 --> 00:17:37.880
I really believe EVAs corrupt kamalas enacted laws that effectively created an

322
00:17:37.900 --> 00:17:41.400
all white governing class up until recently India had been a colonial

323
00:17:41.530 --> 00:17:45.840
enterprise, but one in which Indians could at least attain important positions,

324
00:17:46.480 --> 00:17:47.313
kamalas changed all of that.

325
00:17:47.520 --> 00:17:51.360
A new glass ceiling stopped locals rising above the most minor roles in the

326
00:17:51.361 --> 00:17:54.760
civil service while Indian police units were brought under British control.

327
00:17:54.830 --> 00:17:56.400
Meanwhile, Kamal castigate,

328
00:17:56.460 --> 00:18:00.560
any white officer who he deemed at formal connections with the worst black

329
00:18:00.561 --> 00:18:02.480
people in Bengal. On the flip side,

330
00:18:02.620 --> 00:18:05.840
he did at least try to promote the learning of native languages among British

331
00:18:05.841 --> 00:18:10.750
officials, but compared to everything else that fairly faint silver lining.

332
00:18:10.860 --> 00:18:14.470
There's also the matter of the third Anglo micaw war.

333
00:18:14.690 --> 00:18:16.550
Unlike the American revolutionary war.

334
00:18:16.551 --> 00:18:21.150
This war with the deep Salton of Mya ended in a commons victory in 1790,

335
00:18:21.151 --> 00:18:23.870
the Salton started raid around the edges of British territory.

336
00:18:24.390 --> 00:18:27.910
Kamas personally took control of the response and by April of 1791,

337
00:18:28.090 --> 00:18:30.580
he had taken, I saw city of Bangalore,

338
00:18:30.900 --> 00:18:34.380
but the war dragged on another year in part because koalas refused to trust

339
00:18:34.381 --> 00:18:37.820
Britain's Indian allies leading to an unnecessary prolonging of the fighting.

340
00:18:38.010 --> 00:18:40.740
When he finally did make peace in February of 1792,

341
00:18:40.840 --> 00:18:45.380
it was with a treaty seemingly calculated to please. Absolutely nobody.

342
00:18:45.600 --> 00:18:49.100
The Salton was upset because he had toed half his territory while London was

343
00:18:49.101 --> 00:18:53.250
unhappy. Koalas hadn't held out for the whole lot. Still at least defeating.

344
00:18:53.570 --> 00:18:57.090
Tepo took some of the stench of failure that was left over from Yorktown.

345
00:18:57.190 --> 00:19:01.730
And Koal was certain that this wasn't gonna be his last war in February of 1793,

346
00:19:01.731 --> 00:19:03.370
France. Then in the grip of revolution,

347
00:19:03.850 --> 00:19:07.490
declared war on Britain with his term expiring and certain that'd been needed to

348
00:19:07.491 --> 00:19:11.880
prepare England against a French invasion Kowas and home stopping only to annex

349
00:19:11.881 --> 00:19:15.360
French pond cherry on the way. But although he was made head of the home front,

350
00:19:15.361 --> 00:19:18.480
Charles wouldn't make his final mark on history fighting the French. Well,

351
00:19:18.820 --> 00:19:20.120
not exactly. Instead,

352
00:19:20.121 --> 00:19:23.080
he was destined to spend one last frustrating chapter of his life,

353
00:19:23.260 --> 00:19:25.440
trying to pacify Ireland at the time,

354
00:19:25.720 --> 00:19:28.280
Ireland was in a personal union with Britain, but not a political one.

355
00:19:28.390 --> 00:19:31.430
They had the same king, but were separate countries sort of like how today,

356
00:19:31.431 --> 00:19:34.470
Canada and the UK both have Elizabeth the second as the head of state,

357
00:19:34.570 --> 00:19:35.790
but the Canadians,

358
00:19:36.100 --> 00:19:39.750
fortunately don't have to have Boris Johnson as prime minister. However,

359
00:19:39.810 --> 00:19:44.510
the islands of the 1790s had only just gained autonomy from Britain and no one

360
00:19:44.511 --> 00:19:46.630
was adjusting well to the new state of affairs.

361
00:19:46.850 --> 00:19:50.830
The Catholics who made up about 90% of the population wanted to go further and

362
00:19:51.620 --> 00:19:52.980
Aishia French star Republic,

363
00:19:53.200 --> 00:19:56.580
the Protestant minority who were 10% of the population, but held all the power,

364
00:19:56.640 --> 00:20:01.540
wanted to hug closer to Britain and also just kill as many Catholics as

365
00:20:01.740 --> 00:20:05.860
possible. When this erupted into the United Irishman rebellion in May, 1798,

366
00:20:05.880 --> 00:20:09.300
London freaks out that the French would help their fellow Catholics and

367
00:20:09.620 --> 00:20:12.290
establish a foothold on Britain's doorstep. The solution.

368
00:20:12.640 --> 00:20:17.090
Well that was to send Charles Kawas to quell rebellious Irish. I mean,

369
00:20:17.600 --> 00:20:19.130
what could possibly go wrong

370
00:20:25.550 --> 00:20:29.050
In the ends Kamal's career fighting Irish rebels ended before it even started.

371
00:20:29.270 --> 00:20:32.280
He landed in Dublin on June the 21st, 1798,

372
00:20:32.281 --> 00:20:35.520
only for the rebels to be effectively knocked out of the war before it even

373
00:20:35.680 --> 00:20:36.513
finished unloading,

374
00:20:36.540 --> 00:20:39.680
all it was left to do from a military perspective was to defeat this more French

375
00:20:39.681 --> 00:20:42.760
force that landed in August. But while the war was easily won,

376
00:20:42.761 --> 00:20:44.280
the piece would be a nightmare.

377
00:20:44.600 --> 00:20:48.120
KA Wallace's arena and island basically boiled down to well go and sort out this

378
00:20:48.800 --> 00:20:51.440
annoying islands once and for all old chap. However,

379
00:20:51.670 --> 00:20:53.000
that was easier said than done.

380
00:20:53.400 --> 00:20:57.120
Although London had likely envisioned con Wallace using his broad powers to kick

381
00:20:57.121 --> 00:20:58.680
a few Catholics in the testicles.

382
00:20:58.940 --> 00:21:02.640
The Earl soon came to believe that the rebellious Catholics weren't actually the

383
00:21:02.641 --> 00:21:06.440
problem. It was the Protestant rulers who were tearing Ireland apart were,

384
00:21:06.750 --> 00:21:08.230
is Catholics in the vast majority.

385
00:21:08.330 --> 00:21:12.110
The only way the Protestants could have any importance was by locking their

386
00:21:12.111 --> 00:21:14.470
countrymen outta power and doing that required,

387
00:21:14.471 --> 00:21:17.350
convincing themselves that the Catholic Irish was subhuman.

388
00:21:17.950 --> 00:21:21.790
Komal was a Gast at leading Protestants, celebrating the murder of priests.

389
00:21:21.930 --> 00:21:25.190
He grew to blame the blood thirsty loyalists for the whole sorry, war,

390
00:21:25.470 --> 00:21:29.100
and even began trying to build personal links with the Catholic communities to

391
00:21:29.101 --> 00:21:32.500
sort the mess out. Unfortunately, as chosen method would be very controversial,

392
00:21:33.180 --> 00:21:36.020
not long after defeating the French expeditionary force Ko Wallace had made

393
00:21:36.021 --> 00:21:40.660
friends with the Zen acting secretary of Ireland via castle Ray and ultimate

394
00:21:40.900 --> 00:21:43.420
cast. Ray was the Island's leading proponent of reconciliation,

395
00:21:43.560 --> 00:21:47.020
but did convinced himself that dragging islands into union with great Britain

396
00:21:47.420 --> 00:21:49.570
was the only route to Catholic emancipation.

397
00:21:49.830 --> 00:21:51.770
Now he managed to convince koalas of this two.

398
00:21:51.910 --> 00:21:55.490
The trouble was a truly independent Ireland with equal rights would be a

399
00:21:55.610 --> 00:21:59.770
Catholic Basian in Northern Europe. One, the French would no doubt ally with,

400
00:21:59.870 --> 00:22:03.490
but to leave things as they are risk and Ireland ruled by Protestant tyrants who

401
00:22:03.491 --> 00:22:07.170
repeatedly triggered civil wars and then demanded London, protect them. No,

402
00:22:07.270 --> 00:22:10.840
the only future on Wallace could see was one where Ireland joins with great

403
00:22:10.841 --> 00:22:15.040
Britain and Catholics were emancipated and protected by the benevolent majesty

404
00:22:15.041 --> 00:22:16.000
of George II.

405
00:22:16.180 --> 00:22:20.160
As any American who still remembered the stamp act would tell you this was never

406
00:22:20.410 --> 00:22:22.320
going to work. Nonetheless,

407
00:22:22.840 --> 00:22:26.280
Kowa and castle rate began a determined push to make the union happen.

408
00:22:26.740 --> 00:22:28.320
It was a grueling two years. First,

409
00:22:28.480 --> 00:22:31.910
they had to convince the Protestants who feared their own power being curtailed

410
00:22:31.930 --> 00:22:34.790
and demanded massive bribes to vote it through seconds.

411
00:22:34.900 --> 00:22:37.510
They had to convince the Catholics that this would be a new,

412
00:22:37.830 --> 00:22:42.150
brighter chapter in their history and not just an excuse for London to, oh,

413
00:22:42.430 --> 00:22:44.030
I don't know, brutally exacerbate,

414
00:22:44.031 --> 00:22:47.750
a potato famines several decades down the line, killing millions. Finally,

415
00:22:47.751 --> 00:22:50.940
they had to convince the British cabinet, the Ty Catholic emancipation.

416
00:22:51.140 --> 00:22:55.260
So the act of union was both fair. And just to come is surprised.

417
00:22:55.261 --> 00:22:56.900
They succeeded the cabinet was all like, sure,

418
00:22:56.901 --> 00:22:59.420
we'll oppress them a bit less afterwards.

419
00:22:59.720 --> 00:23:02.460
But then the union actually got voted through and the cabinet were all like,

420
00:23:02.780 --> 00:23:03.613
ha just joking.

421
00:23:03.990 --> 00:23:07.420
Let's oppress the out of them on January the first 1801 Ireland and great

422
00:23:07.580 --> 00:23:10.170
Britain formally joined into a single state that same month,

423
00:23:10.200 --> 00:23:11.450
king Georgia third declared.

424
00:23:11.451 --> 00:23:15.610
There would never be any relief for increased rights for Catholics shortly after

425
00:23:15.870 --> 00:23:19.370
ill exhausted and miserable. Charles KWA resigned privately.

426
00:23:19.371 --> 00:23:23.330
He raged against the mule headed stupidity that would allow Britain to persevere

427
00:23:23.430 --> 00:23:28.050
in the old system of prescription and exclusion in Ireland, but publicly well,

428
00:23:28.250 --> 00:23:30.520
KA Wallace was still all about king and country.

429
00:23:30.880 --> 00:23:33.880
Remember he accepted the settlements and then he packed his bags and returns

430
00:23:33.910 --> 00:23:36.200
home. And that was pretty much it for the Earl.

431
00:23:36.720 --> 00:23:40.200
Although he would play a role negotiating piece with Napoleon after the war of

432
00:23:40.201 --> 00:23:41.760
the second coalition in 1802,

433
00:23:41.860 --> 00:23:45.480
the wind seems to have been sucked out of his sail by the island debacle.

434
00:23:45.580 --> 00:23:46.880
He went back into retirement,

435
00:23:46.881 --> 00:23:50.520
perhaps determined to enjoy the choir life that he and his wife had briefly

436
00:23:50.521 --> 00:23:54.800
known all those years earlier. But in this era, even failure and retirement,

437
00:23:54.801 --> 00:23:58.320
couldn't stop the crown from forcing you into service in July, 1805,

438
00:23:58.480 --> 00:24:01.000
corn Wallace was ordered to return to India. He didn't want to go,

439
00:24:01.060 --> 00:24:04.240
but he felt he couldn't refuse. And sadly it was the wrong choice.

440
00:24:04.830 --> 00:24:07.350
Not long after landing Charles Kawa contracted tropical fever.

441
00:24:07.490 --> 00:24:11.150
He died on October the fifth thousands of kilometers from the country that he

442
00:24:11.151 --> 00:24:12.910
had served so beautifully today.

443
00:24:12.911 --> 00:24:16.950
The most striking thing about KA Wallace's life is how much of it he spent in

444
00:24:16.951 --> 00:24:19.350
over his head in America. He was fighting a war.

445
00:24:19.351 --> 00:24:22.070
He didn't really believe in while totally outwitted in India.

446
00:24:22.090 --> 00:24:26.380
He was tasked with solving intricate problems using only the and TA of racial

447
00:24:26.490 --> 00:24:28.380
apartheid and in Irelands. Well,

448
00:24:28.381 --> 00:24:32.820
let's just say he was too trusting of his own king. It's not to come.

449
00:24:32.821 --> 00:24:34.540
Wallace's detriment that we bring these up.

450
00:24:34.650 --> 00:24:39.020
They are problems that would've befuddled someone with 10 times the talent that

451
00:24:39.120 --> 00:24:41.940
that's sort of the point. Charles KA Wallace was not a talented man.

452
00:24:42.200 --> 00:24:47.170
He was mostly mediocre with occasional flashes of man or brilliance that were

453
00:24:47.430 --> 00:24:49.970
too few and too far between had,

454
00:24:49.971 --> 00:24:53.250
he just stayed in retirement with Jeremiah in 1775.

455
00:24:53.251 --> 00:24:55.210
He would've been completely forgotten by history,

456
00:24:55.211 --> 00:24:57.130
but how much happier his life could have been?

457
00:24:57.510 --> 00:25:01.090
How different the faiths of millions, the story of Charles K.

458
00:25:01.090 --> 00:25:04.930
Wallace is both the tale of a moderate decent man who failed upwards and a

459
00:25:04.931 --> 00:25:07.760
damning indictment of his time. A time when,

460
00:25:07.761 --> 00:25:11.360
who your parents were mattered more than your capabilities con Wallis may have

461
00:25:11.361 --> 00:25:15.080
had these soldiers life had always dreamed of, but as his story shows,

462
00:25:15.220 --> 00:25:19.560
it sometimes may better when our dreams don't come true.

463
00:25:20.020 --> 00:25:21.840
