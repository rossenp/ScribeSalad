<v 0>Just before we get started,</v>

2
00:00:01.160 --> 00:00:03.960
I want to mention another channel that I host called mega projects.

3
00:00:03.961 --> 00:00:07.280
Mega projects is a channel all about mankind's greatest achievements,

4
00:00:07.281 --> 00:00:11.480
where I take a deep look at incredible buildings, projects, and structures,

5
00:00:11.880 --> 00:00:14.800
and more whether it's the world's most impressive skyscrapers,

6
00:00:14.801 --> 00:00:17.920
the international space station or chin noble sarcophagus,

7
00:00:18.400 --> 00:00:22.470
a cover it all new channels come out a couple of times a week on mega projects.

8
00:00:22.471 --> 00:00:26.550
So if you think that could be for you, please do head over there and subscribe.

9
00:00:27.120 --> 00:00:30.430
There is a link in the description below and let's get into it.

10
00:00:36.730 --> 00:00:41.620
The Spanish flu was the single worst disease episode in modern world history

11
00:00:41.880 --> 00:00:45.220
in the space of 18 months in 1918 to 1919,

12
00:00:45.290 --> 00:00:49.420
it's four epidemic waves, skilled tens of millions of people around the globe.

13
00:00:49.700 --> 00:00:50.261
Ravaging,

14
00:00:50.261 --> 00:00:55.220
a population that had already been exhausted by the mass killing tactics of the

15
00:00:55.221 --> 00:00:57.460
war to end wars in the video today,

16
00:00:57.461 --> 00:01:00.580
we're gonna look at the Spanish flu from three perspectives first,

17
00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:05.010
how did it across the world and what was his impact on the everyday lives of

18
00:01:05.130 --> 00:01:05.970
ordinary individuals?

19
00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:10.690
Then we will profile this invisible killer seeking to understand its origins and

20
00:01:10.720 --> 00:01:14.650
murderous methods. And finally, we will assess the death, toll it,

21
00:01:14.651 --> 00:01:19.250
inflicted on the human species and see what we can learn from the experience.

22
00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:22.880
And with that said, let's get into it.

23
00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:39.160
The term Spanish is of course, AMI Noma.

24
00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:43.630
It would be more appropriate to call this the great influenza pan and me of 1918

25
00:01:43.631 --> 00:01:46.550
to 1919. So I will use both terms.

26
00:01:46.730 --> 00:01:49.110
The epidemic did not originate in Spain.

27
00:01:49.111 --> 00:01:52.990
It received this honorary citizenship only because Spain was a neutral country

28
00:01:53.050 --> 00:01:57.950
in world war I and its press was free from censorship to report first about

29
00:01:57.951 --> 00:02:02.310
this mysterious disease, the origins of the pandemic lay elsewhere, though,

30
00:02:02.380 --> 00:02:06.860
most recounts placed the first outbreak at a us army training base camp.

31
00:02:07.460 --> 00:02:10.340
Funston in Kansas in mid-March 1918.

32
00:02:10.520 --> 00:02:14.500
It is here that this flu virus reaped its first 48 victims,

33
00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:18.340
but we'll never know for certain, if that was the true starting point.

34
00:02:18.720 --> 00:02:22.900
The online archive of California holds in their Spanish flu section letter

35
00:02:22.901 --> 00:02:26.050
written by a young recruit. Roy from camp Logan,

36
00:02:26.100 --> 00:02:30.690
Texas on the 1st of March, 1918, heli meant we played another funeral today.

37
00:02:30.790 --> 00:02:33.930
One of the lads from company one died. I knew him real well.

38
00:02:34.200 --> 00:02:38.330
Another funeral on the 1st of March would imply that soldiers had been dying

39
00:02:38.331 --> 00:02:39.330
throughout February,

40
00:02:39.430 --> 00:02:43.690
but the origins of the great flu can be traced even earlier than

41
00:02:43.930 --> 00:02:48.880
1918 as early as 1916 and 1917 army camps in France

42
00:02:49.060 --> 00:02:52.720
and in England had been ravaged by an unknown respiratory disease.

43
00:02:52.980 --> 00:02:56.200
At the time it had been described as pale bronchitis,

44
00:02:56.460 --> 00:03:00.000
but its symptoms resembled those of the Spanish flu. However,

45
00:03:00.010 --> 00:03:04.640
these outbreaks did not spread beyond the two military bases and had died down

46
00:03:04.740 --> 00:03:06.320
by April,

47
00:03:06.320 --> 00:03:10.520
1917 historian mark Humphreys of Canada's Memorial university of Newfoundland in

48
00:03:11.440 --> 00:03:13.560
2014 proposed another origin story.

49
00:03:13.670 --> 00:03:17.760
Humphreys found archival evidence that a respiratory illness that struck

50
00:03:18.040 --> 00:03:19.990
Northern are in November,

51
00:03:19.990 --> 00:03:24.230
1917 was identified a year later by Chinese health officials as identical to the

52
00:03:24.231 --> 00:03:25.510
Spanish flu from China.

53
00:03:25.511 --> 00:03:29.550
British officials organized the transport of 94,000 laborers to the Western

54
00:03:30.030 --> 00:03:30.990
France van, north America,

55
00:03:31.250 --> 00:03:35.150
as part of an auxiliary core in charge of digging trenches and maintaining

56
00:03:35.151 --> 00:03:39.460
supply lines. The laborers were sailed to Vancouver on the Canadian west coast,

57
00:03:39.490 --> 00:03:43.020
then loaded onto trains to Halifax on the east coast,

58
00:03:43.090 --> 00:03:44.780
from which they could be sent to Europe.

59
00:03:45.120 --> 00:03:49.660
The press was forbidden from reporting on these transports and the trains had

60
00:03:49.661 --> 00:03:50.410
been sealed.

61
00:03:50.410 --> 00:03:54.260
Both were meant as a precaution in order to protect the laborers from widespread

62
00:03:55.020 --> 00:03:56.980
anti-Chinese sentiments, but the unintended effects,

63
00:03:57.180 --> 00:04:01.610
it may have been to further the contagion among the auxiliary ranks some

64
00:04:01.660 --> 00:04:05.450
3000 of them while traveling through Canada were quarantined with flu-like

65
00:04:05.451 --> 00:04:09.170
symptoms. And of course, newspapers could not publish a single word about it.

66
00:04:09.171 --> 00:04:13.010
Meaning the infection trains could continue their Eastwood run.

67
00:04:13.230 --> 00:04:16.810
The Chinese laborers arrived in Southern Englands by January,

68
00:04:16.810 --> 00:04:20.320
1918 and were sent to France where a hospital was Noel sume, uh,

69
00:04:20.321 --> 00:04:23.520
recorded hundreds of their deaths from respiratory illness,

70
00:04:23.521 --> 00:04:27.040
whether because of the Chinese laborers or us army recruits,

71
00:04:27.041 --> 00:04:31.120
large movements of troops were accountable for the rapid diffusion of the virus

72
00:04:31.390 --> 00:04:32.960
between may and July.

73
00:04:33.100 --> 00:04:37.080
The great flu had spread across virtually the whole of north and central

74
00:04:37.190 --> 00:04:39.560
America, as well as Europe and Asia.

75
00:04:39.900 --> 00:04:44.630
The prov of region in Russia wrote that the Spanish lady had thrown a whole town

76
00:04:45.350 --> 00:04:46.270
Miran into disarray.

77
00:04:46.450 --> 00:04:50.430
The times of India are reported that nearly every house has some of its inmates

78
00:04:50.660 --> 00:04:54.470
down with influenza E and every office is be wailing.

79
00:04:54.490 --> 00:04:58.590
The absence of Clarks the epidemic had an obvious impact on the war,

80
00:04:58.591 --> 00:05:02.140
which was still raging, especially on the Western France German general,

81
00:05:02.250 --> 00:05:07.140
Eric LUN DOF complained that it was a grievous business having to listen every

82
00:05:07.141 --> 00:05:11.460
morning to the chief of staff's recital of the number of influenza cases and

83
00:05:11.461 --> 00:05:14.020
their complaints about the weakness of their troops.

84
00:05:14.120 --> 00:05:17.820
He would later even blame the failure of his spring, offensive on the virus.

85
00:05:18.410 --> 00:05:22.490
This was all the first wave, which seemed bad at the time.

86
00:05:22.550 --> 00:05:24.690
And it actually was pretty bad,

87
00:05:24.870 --> 00:05:28.250
but it was nothing compared to what was gonna come next.

88
00:05:34.790 --> 00:05:36.930
During the first sweep of the Spanish lady,

89
00:05:36.950 --> 00:05:39.570
the influenza virus probably went through a mutation process,

90
00:05:39.700 --> 00:05:41.970
which made it much deadlier. This, uh,

91
00:05:42.360 --> 00:05:45.880
enhanced killer made its first appearance in late August of 1918.

92
00:05:45.881 --> 00:05:50.560
When the second wave took off almost simultaneously from three major wartime

93
00:05:50.650 --> 00:05:52.320
ports, Boston USA,

94
00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:57.480
breast and France and Freetown in Sierra Leone from the three ports,

95
00:05:57.680 --> 00:05:58.441
thousands of sailors,

96
00:05:58.441 --> 00:06:02.880
soldiers and civilian travelers became vectors for the virus aboard their ship.

97
00:06:02.900 --> 00:06:03.760
In a matter of weeks,

98
00:06:03.860 --> 00:06:07.960
the infected spread the disease across the four corners of the globe with only a

99
00:06:07.961 --> 00:06:10.680
handful of remote locations being spared the ordeal.

100
00:06:10.860 --> 00:06:14.520
The second way of drag down throughout the whole of autumn and the early winter

101
00:06:14.580 --> 00:06:18.590
of 1919, the ends war on the 11th of November,

102
00:06:18.590 --> 00:06:21.910
1918 did not mitigate the onslaught. Arguably it just made it worse.

103
00:06:22.070 --> 00:06:24.310
Millions of soldiers, D demobilized,

104
00:06:24.311 --> 00:06:29.230
hundreds of thousands of POWs returned home carrying an unwanted stowaway

105
00:06:29.570 --> 00:06:30.670
inside their lungs.

106
00:06:30.870 --> 00:06:34.110
A whole generation of young men had been decimated by artillery,

107
00:06:34.120 --> 00:06:36.350
weaponized gas machine gunfire,

108
00:06:36.570 --> 00:06:41.220
and who survived were likely to die because of a single droplet of

109
00:06:41.460 --> 00:06:45.300
saliva. It took only one single virus inside a single droplet,

110
00:06:45.540 --> 00:06:49.500
outta 40,000 dejected by a single sneeze. And just like that,

111
00:06:49.920 --> 00:06:54.540
you were infected the feeling of the fragility of life in those times

112
00:06:54.760 --> 00:06:59.570
is captured by the everyday correspondence ordinary people in September, 1918,

113
00:06:59.690 --> 00:07:01.250
a post officer worker in Plymouth,

114
00:07:01.251 --> 00:07:05.370
Massachusetts wrote to his wife about the grueling conditions he works in in

115
00:07:05.371 --> 00:07:10.290
order to ensure a continuing service submits the constant death caused by the

116
00:07:10.310 --> 00:07:12.610
flu. I have some more, very bad news to write you.

117
00:07:12.630 --> 00:07:15.930
And I guess if things keep on that by the ends of the year,

118
00:07:16.250 --> 00:07:19.400
there will be nobody left in town. Ashley died yesterday.

119
00:07:20.080 --> 00:07:23.680
Herald will be buried just as soon as his body arrives and there will be no

120
00:07:23.681 --> 00:07:27.640
funeral. On Friday. We had seven funerals and Saturday about as many.

121
00:07:27.940 --> 00:07:31.680
So you see what we are up against in Brockton three days last week,

122
00:07:32.080 --> 00:07:34.400
there was one every hour on the 11th of October,

123
00:07:34.680 --> 00:07:38.320
a recruiting training in Michigan wrote to a friends this in his camp,

124
00:07:38.720 --> 00:07:43.430
50 die every day from it from the 16th to the 27th of October,

125
00:07:43.590 --> 00:07:46.910
a series of letters from Mrs. Alma senior to her daughter,

126
00:07:47.350 --> 00:07:52.110
Alma junior show how unbreakable a mother's love can be writing from Rochester,

127
00:07:52.210 --> 00:07:52.570
New York,

128
00:07:52.570 --> 00:07:56.310
Mrs. Alma worries that her daughter is safe and healthy in her college in

129
00:07:56.340 --> 00:07:57.310
Ontario, Canada.

130
00:07:57.580 --> 00:08:00.940
Some of them motherly advice resonates with what you hear these days.

131
00:08:01.240 --> 00:08:04.940
She wrote was just wondering how you were getting in these days of epidemic in

132
00:08:04.941 --> 00:08:09.260
the country. It is fierce and so many dying over here is something awful.

133
00:08:09.261 --> 00:08:10.780
People are dying and it's awful.

134
00:08:11.150 --> 00:08:14.260
Don't worry off threats because you can only walk in the yard.

135
00:08:14.600 --> 00:08:18.620
Be glad you can do that. Keep in fresh air or you can and keep warm.

136
00:08:19.060 --> 00:08:23.010
But your bath robot at night, hot lemonade at night is excellent for influenza,

137
00:08:23.430 --> 00:08:24.263
Mrs. Alma,

138
00:08:24.290 --> 00:08:27.570
then laments that she cannot help her other daughter with her little baby Jane,

139
00:08:27.571 --> 00:08:29.530
because she is invalid at home.

140
00:08:29.670 --> 00:08:34.370
And that it is impossible to get nurses while worrying about the wellbeing of

141
00:08:34.371 --> 00:08:36.810
her daughters and doing what she could to help her granddaughter.

142
00:08:37.110 --> 00:08:40.010
Mrs. Alma Zi with cancer baby, unable to,

143
00:08:40.080 --> 00:08:42.640
to access medical care earlier because of the pandemic.

144
00:08:42.860 --> 00:08:47.720
She was eventually hospitalized on the 27th of October and died on the 6th of

145
00:08:47.720 --> 00:08:49.320
November on the 31st of October,

146
00:08:49.321 --> 00:08:53.040
an official at the mayor's office of San Francisco took the initiative to notify

147
00:08:53.041 --> 00:08:57.040
his counterpart in Santa Barbara about effective public health measures in a

148
00:08:57.041 --> 00:08:59.120
city, sending this for your information,

149
00:08:59.121 --> 00:09:03.440
because I have seen the whole terrible effect of epidemic here because masks

150
00:09:03.441 --> 00:09:06.040
have saved untold suffering and many deaths.

151
00:09:06.040 --> 00:09:08.520
And because Santa Barbara is my old home city,

152
00:09:08.900 --> 00:09:12.280
the measure in place was simply the universal wearing of masks.

153
00:09:12.530 --> 00:09:16.470
Three days after the use became general new cases in San Francisco dropped by

154
00:09:16.471 --> 00:09:19.390
50%. But the daily death toll was above a hundred.

155
00:09:19.850 --> 00:09:21.070
On the other side of the ponds,

156
00:09:21.071 --> 00:09:23.470
London was being stricken as hard as New York state,

157
00:09:23.471 --> 00:09:27.390
California and Ontario on the 28th of October, 1918 one,

158
00:09:27.450 --> 00:09:30.190
Mrs. Bennett wrote things here are in a terrible state,

159
00:09:30.191 --> 00:09:34.310
this new flu taking people off as they walk along the streets. In fact,

160
00:09:34.450 --> 00:09:38.300
the takers can't turn the coffins out or bury the people quick enough.

161
00:09:38.820 --> 00:09:42.620
There's family is of six or seven in one house lay dead on the same day.

162
00:09:42.740 --> 00:09:46.300
An American soldier stationed in France wrote to his mother reassuring her that

163
00:09:46.301 --> 00:09:49.900
the situation where he was stationed was not as bad as it was at another base

164
00:09:50.340 --> 00:09:51.173
count Sherman.

165
00:09:51.180 --> 00:09:54.340
He also mentioned that the French people have a way of treating the flu.

166
00:09:54.341 --> 00:09:57.490
They make some kind of he of some kind of leaves.

167
00:09:57.600 --> 00:09:59.730
Unfortunately he didn't provide the recipe.

168
00:10:06.080 --> 00:10:09.970
Another series of letters from an American private provides a good example of

169
00:10:09.971 --> 00:10:10.804
acquired immunity.

170
00:10:10.910 --> 00:10:15.890
Martin Allos Khan known as Al was stationed at Cal forest George,

171
00:10:16.470 --> 00:10:19.200
from where he wrote to his brother and to his best friends,

172
00:10:19.920 --> 00:10:23.720
barley mourns the death of his Bunky Thomas. He was in relatively high spirits.

173
00:10:23.820 --> 00:10:27.240
He had survived the great pandemic, not once, but twice.

174
00:10:27.700 --> 00:10:31.160
I'm still in quarantine that I will be released today. I'm feeling great.

175
00:10:31.260 --> 00:10:34.160
And the two days rest has done me, a world of good.

176
00:10:34.580 --> 00:10:36.990
His main concern was that while in quarantine,

177
00:10:37.130 --> 00:10:38.990
he had been neglecting the ladies.

178
00:10:39.450 --> 00:10:43.630
So he asked his friend cliff to check on Ursula, Ella, Ida, Mary Rosemary,

179
00:10:43.631 --> 00:10:44.750
English, and Maryanne.

180
00:10:45.090 --> 00:10:49.390
So was our simply lucky in love and health? Well,

181
00:10:49.391 --> 00:10:52.950
there is strong evidence suggesting that exposure to previous waves of the

182
00:10:52.951 --> 00:10:56.910
Spanish flu could generate acquired immunity in those who had been infected,

183
00:10:57.740 --> 00:11:00.100
but had survived research led by Dr.

184
00:11:00.380 --> 00:11:02.820
Jay and Barry from Tulane and Xavier universities,

185
00:11:02.821 --> 00:11:07.380
Louisiana highlighted how the first wave of the Spanish flu was characterized by

186
00:11:07.460 --> 00:11:10.860
a high number of cases, but had a lower fatality rate than the second wave.

187
00:11:11.040 --> 00:11:13.100
By looking at medical records of us soldiers,

188
00:11:13.101 --> 00:11:17.260
he estimated that the fatality rate during the lethal autumn sweep was 4.7

189
00:11:18.070 --> 00:11:20.610
in the spring. It had been only 1.1. However,

190
00:11:20.710 --> 00:11:24.170
the deadly marriage of the second wave had largely spared.

191
00:11:24.171 --> 00:11:26.730
Those who had previously been exposed in the spring,

192
00:11:26.910 --> 00:11:29.530
the case of camp Dodge illustrates this perfectly here.

193
00:11:29.670 --> 00:11:33.530
One regimen of troops that experienced the first wave while another regimen had

194
00:11:33.531 --> 00:11:35.690
escaped it among those exposed in the spring,

195
00:11:36.000 --> 00:11:40.400
only 6.6 became sick with flu that autumn in contrast,

196
00:11:40.401 --> 00:11:42.320
among the troops not exposed in the spring,

197
00:11:42.440 --> 00:11:46.240
a staggering 48.5% fellow during the second wave.

198
00:11:46.660 --> 00:11:51.520
Now the witness accounts and research mentioned so far may refer to America or

199
00:11:51.521 --> 00:11:52.240
Europe,

200
00:11:52.240 --> 00:11:56.200
but this should not give the impression that other continents were spared.

201
00:11:56.570 --> 00:11:58.720
Let's go back to September, 1918.

202
00:11:58.870 --> 00:12:03.120
This is when Indian troops who had served on the Western front returned home.

203
00:12:03.260 --> 00:12:07.880
The first outbreak took place in Bombay where mortality rate was more than 5% of

204
00:12:07.881 --> 00:12:08.714
all the population.

205
00:12:08.940 --> 00:12:13.270
The Spanish lady had now access to a huge new territory,

206
00:12:13.580 --> 00:12:16.710
densely populated serviced by a large railway network.

207
00:12:17.090 --> 00:12:20.070
It was the perfect storm in just a month.

208
00:12:20.210 --> 00:12:24.070
The flu had spread to Sri Lanka and to the Northern provinces reaping and

209
00:12:24.071 --> 00:12:26.590
estimated 14 to 18 million lives.

210
00:12:26.690 --> 00:12:30.390
The highest death are recorded in a single country. Also in September,

211
00:12:30.630 --> 00:12:33.980
a troop transport sales off Bombay to on BAA Kenya.

212
00:12:34.400 --> 00:12:36.380
Of course the virus was AOW away.

213
00:12:36.440 --> 00:12:39.100
The infection spread to members of the Kenyan carrier Corps,

214
00:12:39.120 --> 00:12:42.220
who were just about to be demobilized. As they returned home,

215
00:12:42.221 --> 00:12:44.140
they carried the contagion inlands,

216
00:12:44.141 --> 00:12:47.300
adding to the death doll caused by the other two major African outbreaks

217
00:12:47.301 --> 00:12:51.180
originating in Sierra Leone and South Africa. Most of Africa had been spar.

218
00:12:51.280 --> 00:12:51.941
The first wave,

219
00:12:51.941 --> 00:12:56.330
meaning that the autumn burst had truly scorched through the continents towns

220
00:12:56.331 --> 00:13:01.250
like Kimberley add Ababa and win lost over 4% of their populations

221
00:13:01.810 --> 00:13:04.570
flew. The bulk of the victims were between 18 and 40.

222
00:13:04.710 --> 00:13:08.530
So the effect on society was disastrous in terms of loss of labor,

223
00:13:08.531 --> 00:13:12.530
reproductive capacity and family structures. It was a sudden demographic,

224
00:13:12.531 --> 00:13:17.240
social and economic attack trophy without precedent back in India, by November,

225
00:13:17.260 --> 00:13:19.480
the rate of contagion had largely subsided.

226
00:13:19.540 --> 00:13:22.720
It is speculated that this was due to the onset of the monsoon season.

227
00:13:22.820 --> 00:13:25.760
As humid climates are not favorable to flu viruses.

228
00:13:25.820 --> 00:13:29.320
The March of the invisible Tyran nonetheless continued eastward reaching China

229
00:13:29.690 --> 00:13:34.360
until now the majority of the victims worldwide had been aged 15 to 34 and

230
00:13:34.550 --> 00:13:36.910
bracket unusual for influenza pandemics.

231
00:13:37.040 --> 00:13:41.150
We'll find out later why this group was particularly targeted in China.

232
00:13:41.550 --> 00:13:45.990
The second wave prayed on an even younger cohort. Children aged 11 to 15.

233
00:13:46.300 --> 00:13:50.310
Overall the mortality rate was much lower compared to India and other countries.

234
00:13:50.870 --> 00:13:53.310
Researchers from the Hong Kong Institute of Chinese medicine,

235
00:13:53.340 --> 00:13:57.580
theorized that traditional Chinese might have actually played a part remedies

236
00:13:57.581 --> 00:14:01.500
put in place by local government included spraying houses with a lime water or

237
00:14:01.501 --> 00:14:05.500
burning rhubarb and root stalk to disinfect the app for prevention villages were

238
00:14:05.501 --> 00:14:08.100
advised to drink Hmong bean soup and rock sugar gap.

239
00:14:08.540 --> 00:14:11.660
Another explanation is one hinted out earlier since the pandemic had originated

240
00:14:11.940 --> 00:14:14.900
there, Chinese citizen said already developed an immunity to it.

241
00:14:15.240 --> 00:14:17.090
By early months of 1919,

242
00:14:17.091 --> 00:14:21.330
the rage of the pandemic was relatively tamed and I stressed relatively there.

243
00:14:21.430 --> 00:14:22.970
The early spring of the year,

244
00:14:23.070 --> 00:14:25.690
saw a third wave making the rounds throughout the globe,

245
00:14:26.130 --> 00:14:30.170
although it did not match the speed reach and variance of the autumn wave.

246
00:14:30.430 --> 00:14:34.370
It was still deadly on March the fifth, 1919, a young Canadian man,

247
00:14:34.371 --> 00:14:36.320
Harold wrote to a friend in Illinois. I,

248
00:14:36.610 --> 00:14:39.960
there are an awful lot of people dying right now on account of the flu.

249
00:14:40.280 --> 00:14:44.680
A little girl next door was buried today and there is a lady up the street that

250
00:14:44.681 --> 00:14:48.120
is pretty sick and my little sister is just getting over it.

251
00:14:48.460 --> 00:14:53.160
So I guess it is pretty near my turn. We don't know if Harold made it or not.

252
00:14:53.500 --> 00:14:56.440
The third sweep was followed by a fourth wave, less severe,

253
00:14:56.441 --> 00:14:59.080
which lingered on in locations, such as Scandinavia,

254
00:14:59.140 --> 00:15:00.680
the south Atlantic and Sicily.

255
00:15:00.940 --> 00:15:05.880
It is still debated whether this was a mutated strain of the original virus or a

256
00:15:05.881 --> 00:15:06.714
new one altogether.

257
00:15:06.860 --> 00:15:11.110
One of the final victims of the fourth wave was a little girl PMO,

258
00:15:11.260 --> 00:15:15.070
Rosa Lombardo. She had been born on the 13th of December,

259
00:15:15.070 --> 00:15:19.550
1918 at the height of the autumn flu in Europe and passed away aged only two on

260
00:15:19.551 --> 00:15:21.790
the 6th of December, 1920. Her father,

261
00:15:22.150 --> 00:15:25.430
a agreed by such a sudden and meaningless death asked for her body to be

262
00:15:25.431 --> 00:15:28.510
preserved as if she was still asleep. Moncur later,

263
00:15:28.860 --> 00:15:33.100
Rosalia can still be seen sleeping in the Capuchin CHUs of Paramo.

264
00:15:33.210 --> 00:15:37.580
This unwiting Memorial to the great pandemic is now known as the most beautiful

265
00:15:37.860 --> 00:15:38.693
money in Europe

266
00:15:51.550 --> 00:15:54.610
At a high level, flu viruses are divided into four types,

267
00:15:54.930 --> 00:15:59.890
a to D and type A's can be divided into further subcategories

268
00:15:59.891 --> 00:16:03.970
depending on the subtypes of two proteins present on their surface.

269
00:16:04.460 --> 00:16:09.170
These are helut in H and neuraminidase N the

270
00:16:09.171 --> 00:16:13.880
influenza responsible for the 1918 pandemic was identified as being a type

271
00:16:14.080 --> 00:16:18.880
a H one N one subtype viruses of the a H one N one type are

272
00:16:19.040 --> 00:16:20.280
actually quite common among humans,

273
00:16:20.420 --> 00:16:25.360
but we'll find out later what made this specific virus so special and quite

274
00:16:25.361 --> 00:16:30.120
so lethal a 2001 study suggested that the 1918 virus may have originated

275
00:16:30.300 --> 00:16:32.870
in swine hosts before moving on to humans.

276
00:16:33.090 --> 00:16:37.670
But another investigation in 2005 suggested a more likely source was

277
00:16:37.760 --> 00:16:40.350
birds. The enteric tracts of waterfowl,

278
00:16:40.351 --> 00:16:45.150
such as ducks and geese are known to be the reservoirs for all known influenza,

279
00:16:45.430 --> 00:16:48.950
a viruses for those of you notey with physiology or anatomy,

280
00:16:49.210 --> 00:16:54.100
the enteric tract is the nervous system that regulates the digestion within

281
00:16:54.160 --> 00:16:57.980
the original host. Let's say a duck. The virus may mutate over time,

282
00:16:57.981 --> 00:17:02.820
either independently or by recombination with a gene segment from a different

283
00:17:02.821 --> 00:17:04.980
virus. Now that the pathogen is mutated,

284
00:17:05.090 --> 00:17:09.940
it's ready to jump species usually from avian to Mamal and attack a new

285
00:17:09.941 --> 00:17:13.500
type of cell. For example, those lining the lungs. This is,

286
00:17:13.730 --> 00:17:16.170
is almost certainly what happened to the Spanish flu strain.

287
00:17:16.470 --> 00:17:21.010
And we should stress almost in two separate studies of 1999 and

288
00:17:21.770 --> 00:17:25.970
2005 Oxford university in the Atlanta center for disease control were able to

289
00:17:26.040 --> 00:17:28.370
reconstruct the genome of the original virus.

290
00:17:28.640 --> 00:17:33.410
What they found is that the 1918 influenza was composed of eight gene segments.

291
00:17:33.570 --> 00:17:38.400
So all from any of the hundreds of both avian and mamalian virus that's

292
00:17:38.401 --> 00:17:42.680
collected since 1917, this was literally one of the kinds,

293
00:17:42.780 --> 00:17:47.280
the unique quality made it impossible to ascertain who or what could have been

294
00:17:47.340 --> 00:17:52.000
the original host of the virus and how it evolved into its lethal final form.

295
00:17:52.070 --> 00:17:53.280
Another clue normally,

296
00:17:53.560 --> 00:17:58.240
outbreaks of viruses with an avian origin are preceded by large die offs of

297
00:17:58.241 --> 00:18:02.560
poultry or other bird populations that this was not the case within 1918

298
00:18:02.880 --> 00:18:07.880
pandemic. The initial animal host the patient's alpha is still unidentified.

299
00:18:14.290 --> 00:18:18.870
One thing was clear about the 1918 H one N one virus its Vince and

300
00:18:18.980 --> 00:18:22.310
pathogenicity were unrivaled compared to other viruses,

301
00:18:22.311 --> 00:18:26.070
which both preceded it and followed it to clarify these points.

302
00:18:26.590 --> 00:18:28.830
Pathogen is defined as the,

303
00:18:29.500 --> 00:18:34.340
of an infectious agent to cause disease or damage in a host virulence on the

304
00:18:34.341 --> 00:18:37.260
other hand is a measure of the severity of said disease.

305
00:18:37.540 --> 00:18:41.100
A microorganism can be pathogenic or not. If it is pathogenic,

306
00:18:41.280 --> 00:18:45.500
its virulence can vary from mild to fatal let's look at

307
00:18:45.501 --> 00:18:50.410
pathogenicity first contemporary normal flu viruses require presence of the

308
00:18:50.411 --> 00:18:51.490
enzyme Tripps in,

309
00:18:51.550 --> 00:18:55.930
in their human host in order to replicate the 1918 virus instead could

310
00:18:55.931 --> 00:19:00.610
proliferate even in the absence of Tripps in making it more pathogenic than

311
00:19:00.611 --> 00:19:01.444
other viruses,

312
00:19:01.470 --> 00:19:06.050
the Spanish flu also displayed a unique capacity to proliferate at high rates in

313
00:19:06.290 --> 00:19:10.680
site human bronchial cells. And that explains its virulence little by little,

314
00:19:10.920 --> 00:19:12.880
a picture of the killer was emerging.

315
00:19:12.900 --> 00:19:17.080
Thanks to modern researchers in the role of crime scene investigators or

316
00:19:17.240 --> 00:19:18.120
criminal profilers.

317
00:19:18.220 --> 00:19:23.040
The next step was to understand how Mr type a H one N one of the 1918

318
00:19:23.210 --> 00:19:28.120
class actually killed what was its modus opera Randi and Dr. David

319
00:19:28.580 --> 00:19:32.750
MOS of the national Institute of allergy and infectious diseases in Maryland in

320
00:19:33.590 --> 00:19:38.030
2007, he reviewed autopsy records for influenza casualties in the 1918 to

321
00:19:38.270 --> 00:19:41.670
1919 period and identified two overlapping syndromes,

322
00:19:41.671 --> 00:19:46.670
which caused the death of the infected hosts in at least 85 to 90% of cases,

323
00:19:46.750 --> 00:19:51.660
patients suffered from an acute viral infection that spread down the respiratory

324
00:19:52.180 --> 00:19:54.860
tracted causing severe tissue damage inside the lungs.

325
00:19:54.960 --> 00:19:58.580
The damaged tissue was then invaded by a so-called secondary invasion.

326
00:19:58.760 --> 00:19:59.980
It wasn't a virus this time,

327
00:20:00.040 --> 00:20:04.780
but rather bacteria pathogens like strepto Carcas or STAARs,

328
00:20:04.781 --> 00:20:09.540
which invade the damaged lungs causing cases of aggressive broncho pneumonia.

329
00:20:09.800 --> 00:20:13.610
In other words, the killer virus did not act alone, but had accomplices.

330
00:20:13.750 --> 00:20:17.850
The actions of these cohorts eventually led to severe pulmonary hemorrhage and

331
00:20:18.010 --> 00:20:20.930
necrosis or tissue death within the bronch eye.

332
00:20:21.270 --> 00:20:26.210
The remaining 10 to 15% of fatal cases suffered from a R D S or acute

333
00:20:26.360 --> 00:20:30.010
respiratory distress like syndrome patients with this syndrome could be easily

334
00:20:30.490 --> 00:20:33.760
identified by their peculiar B Lu gray facial discoloration,

335
00:20:33.790 --> 00:20:37.640
typical sign of drowning because, well, that's essentially what was happening.

336
00:20:37.660 --> 00:20:41.880
The virus caused the pulmonary blood vessels to exude huge amounts of thin

337
00:20:42.060 --> 00:20:45.160
watery droplets, which clogged the lung tissue. In other words,

338
00:20:45.330 --> 00:20:49.280
these patients were drowning in a liquid created by their own bodies.

339
00:20:49.660 --> 00:20:52.240
So now that we've clarified the modus opera, Andi of the killer,

340
00:20:52.300 --> 00:20:55.120
we have to understand its peculiar choice of victims.

341
00:20:55.720 --> 00:20:59.400
Normally flu epidemics claim, most of their victims among the elderly,

342
00:20:59.420 --> 00:21:03.360
but the Spanish flu had a clear pre action for a younger demographic.

343
00:21:03.530 --> 00:21:06.280
Those aged between 15 and 34,

344
00:21:06.750 --> 00:21:11.030
a lower than expected mortality among the elderly may have been explained by

345
00:21:11.031 --> 00:21:11.864
acquired immunity,

346
00:21:12.100 --> 00:21:16.070
individuals aged 40 and over may have been exposed to one of the three flu

347
00:21:16.350 --> 00:21:20.110
pandemics of the 19th century in 18 30,

348
00:21:20.110 --> 00:21:23.390
18 47 or 1889. Although not everybody agrees,

349
00:21:23.570 --> 00:21:25.150
unlike the 1918 strain,

350
00:21:25.200 --> 00:21:28.980
these previous viruses not cause aggressive broncho,

351
00:21:28.981 --> 00:21:30.580
pneumonia or lung hemorrhage,

352
00:21:30.920 --> 00:21:34.620
we may have more convincing answers explaining why the death rate was higher

353
00:21:34.790 --> 00:21:38.020
among the young ones, Dr. Robert Snellgrove from Imperial college,

354
00:21:38.021 --> 00:21:42.580
London among others has theorized the notion of these so-called cytokines storm

355
00:21:43.010 --> 00:21:46.860
cytokines are proteins released by cells to interact with each other and to

356
00:21:46.861 --> 00:21:50.770
trigger specific Vic processes. For example, internal inflammation,

357
00:21:50.890 --> 00:21:53.290
a common reaction of the body against infections,

358
00:21:53.650 --> 00:21:58.170
a younger organism would naturally release more cytokines than an elderly one.

359
00:21:58.310 --> 00:21:59.010
In the case,

360
00:21:59.010 --> 00:22:02.530
if the Spanish flu the cells of the infected younger patients release a

361
00:22:02.680 --> 00:22:04.770
deleterious excess of cytokines,

362
00:22:04.800 --> 00:22:09.160
leading to excessive inflammation of the lungs, and more importantly,

363
00:22:09.220 --> 00:22:10.440
tissue necrosis,

364
00:22:10.570 --> 00:22:14.960
ironically younger fitter organisms deployed a stronger reaction to protect

365
00:22:14.961 --> 00:22:18.160
themselves of reaction, which eventually claimed their lives.

366
00:22:29.460 --> 00:22:32.630
Shortly after the last wave had died down, the scientific community,

367
00:22:32.920 --> 00:22:37.390
tried to take stock of the magnitude of the disaster. American bacteriologist,

368
00:22:37.830 --> 00:22:40.950
Edwin Oaks. Jordan was one of the first to calculate the death toll,

369
00:22:40.951 --> 00:22:45.470
which she estimated to be in the vicinity of 21.5 million people.

370
00:22:45.770 --> 00:22:50.140
The number in itself is staggering. Compare it to the casual of the great war,

371
00:22:50.141 --> 00:22:54.140
which was about 10 million dead soldiers killed over a period of four and a half

372
00:22:54.141 --> 00:22:54.640
years.

373
00:22:54.640 --> 00:22:58.500
The Spanish flu killed twice as many people over a little more than a year.

374
00:22:58.880 --> 00:23:02.260
Now let's compare it to the world's population in 1918. At that time,

375
00:23:02.261 --> 00:23:04.140
there were 1.8 billion people on the planet.

376
00:23:04.400 --> 00:23:07.340
The Spanish flu killed 1.2% of them.

377
00:23:07.560 --> 00:23:10.010
If we apply that ratio to today's elation,

378
00:23:10.120 --> 00:23:14.290
that would've been a death toll of more than 93 million people.

379
00:23:14.670 --> 00:23:17.050
Oak Jordan's estimates stood for decades,

380
00:23:17.390 --> 00:23:21.650
but it was later challenged as being too low. First in 1986,

381
00:23:21.651 --> 00:23:25.890
publication calculated the mortality in India alone to be at 18 million people

382
00:23:25.970 --> 00:23:28.370
subsequently in 1991, authors,

383
00:23:28.371 --> 00:23:32.680
David Patterson and Gerald P Hal proposed another estimate placing the death

384
00:23:32.681 --> 00:23:35.360
toll between 25 and 40 million victims.

385
00:23:35.940 --> 00:23:37.920
But was that the definitive number?

386
00:23:38.880 --> 00:23:43.720
Probably not the 2002 study by Dr. Neal Johnson and Dr. Y and Muller

387
00:23:43.830 --> 00:23:47.560
suggested that the previous numbers may have been underestimated due to common

388
00:23:47.561 --> 00:23:51.520
issues such as missing records, misdiagnosis or death certificates,

389
00:23:51.521 --> 00:23:53.360
compiled by non-medical personnel.

390
00:23:53.500 --> 00:23:57.840
Not only that deaths among indigenous populations and colonial dominions may

391
00:23:57.841 --> 00:23:59.480
have been overlooked, ignored,

392
00:23:59.481 --> 00:24:02.720
or simply not reported to the colonial authorities. Also,

393
00:24:02.750 --> 00:24:06.390
most of the reports collected at time of the pandemic referred to deaths,

394
00:24:06.391 --> 00:24:10.830
taking place during the major wave of autumn, winter, influenza mortality,

395
00:24:10.831 --> 00:24:14.870
before and after that wave may have been ignored or reported under other causes

396
00:24:14.871 --> 00:24:17.110
of death, such as pneumonia, all in all,

397
00:24:17.470 --> 00:24:19.990
considering all these instances of under reporting Johnson,

398
00:24:20.470 --> 00:24:25.340
Mueller placed their estimate in a range from 50 to 100 million debt.

399
00:24:25.680 --> 00:24:30.500
And let's stop for a second just to consider that a hundred million debt the

400
00:24:30.501 --> 00:24:33.620
entire us population at the time was just 108 million.

401
00:24:33.800 --> 00:24:37.100
The whole of Latin America had only 57 million inhabitants.

402
00:24:37.210 --> 00:24:41.900
Sometimes numbers may not be enough to represent the sheer scale of a tragedy.

403
00:24:42.440 --> 00:24:45.460
So just think about it this way. In a matter of a few months,

404
00:24:45.790 --> 00:24:50.730
one USA or two Latin Americas had been completely wiped out by a

405
00:24:50.731 --> 00:24:55.370
microscopic being, which had likely originated in the bowels of a duck.

406
00:24:55.710 --> 00:24:56.510
In all honesty,

407
00:24:56.510 --> 00:24:59.730
the more we researched the death told the more we found conflicting accounts

408
00:24:59.731 --> 00:25:03.250
ranging from the top counts of a hundred million down to 18 million.

409
00:25:03.590 --> 00:25:07.240
We will likely never know how many people did not get to see the next year

410
00:25:07.390 --> 00:25:11.200
because of the great killer of 1918 and 1919.

411
00:25:17.860 --> 00:25:18.840
In our grim research,

412
00:25:18.900 --> 00:25:23.120
we also came across an even Bleaker notion how many victims didn't even get to

413
00:25:23.121 --> 00:25:25.200
see their first day of life. In other words,

414
00:25:25.420 --> 00:25:28.110
the impact of the great influenza on unborn children,

415
00:25:28.490 --> 00:25:31.390
Dr. Bloom Fe back of Mount Sinai school of medicine,

416
00:25:31.490 --> 00:25:36.390
New York and her team have examined the relationship between influenza and birth

417
00:25:36.710 --> 00:25:40.350
rates during the great pandemic in the us, Denmark, Sweden, and Norway,

418
00:25:40.450 --> 00:25:44.830
the analysis showed a decline in birth rates for all examined populations in the

419
00:25:44.831 --> 00:25:45.950
spring of 1919.

420
00:25:46.300 --> 00:25:51.180
This decline presented a 15% drop below baseline levels recorded before the

421
00:25:51.380 --> 00:25:54.380
pandemic. This mortality depression reached its maximum levels.

422
00:25:54.430 --> 00:25:57.820
About six months after the pandemic peak of the previous autumn.

423
00:25:57.850 --> 00:26:01.780
This suggested that the decline in births could be attributed to a surge in

424
00:26:01.781 --> 00:26:03.220
first trimester, miscarriages,

425
00:26:03.221 --> 00:26:06.940
which affected about 10% of all women who were pregnant at the peak of the

426
00:26:07.140 --> 00:26:07.710
pandemic.

427
00:26:07.710 --> 00:26:12.090
The conclusion of the bloom fesh bark team is that the virus was directly

428
00:26:12.091 --> 00:26:13.810
responsible for the miscarriages.

429
00:26:14.110 --> 00:26:18.530
And the 10% incidence rate may have been an underestimation as they point out in

430
00:26:18.730 --> 00:26:23.650
1919 report of 1,350 pregnant women with influenza showed how

431
00:26:23.651 --> 00:26:27.730
more than a quarter of them had miscarried. The concepts of so many babies,

432
00:26:28.010 --> 00:26:29.960
not even being born is hard to accept,

433
00:26:30.060 --> 00:26:32.560
but the same study revealed another finding,

434
00:26:32.610 --> 00:26:35.080
which shows that regardless of the disaster,

435
00:26:35.380 --> 00:26:38.440
our species is always capable of bouncing back.

436
00:26:38.780 --> 00:26:43.240
The dip in birth rates in spring of 1919 was followed by a compensator

437
00:26:44.080 --> 00:26:47.920
mortality increase in late autumn, 19, 19 and early spring, 1920,

438
00:26:48.110 --> 00:26:51.600
when mortality significantly exceeded the expected rates,

439
00:26:51.900 --> 00:26:56.120
the resurgence of births confirmed that fertility was not permanently impacted.

440
00:26:56.600 --> 00:26:58.400
Humanity could slowly rebuild itself,

441
00:26:58.760 --> 00:27:02.200
lick the wounds inflicted by the double tragedy of the great war and the great

442
00:27:02.400 --> 00:27:07.190
pan endemic and slowly return to normal return to a daily life and to historical

443
00:27:07.380 --> 00:27:11.190
periods that was going to be devoid of war famine and disease.

444
00:27:11.690 --> 00:27:13.190
At least according to some leaders,

445
00:27:13.750 --> 00:27:17.350
a period which turned out to only be a 20 year truce.

446
00:27:17.410 --> 00:27:18.990
But while that's another story,

447
00:27:25.490 --> 00:27:26.740
Back in 2004,

448
00:27:26.940 --> 00:27:30.820
a team at the Harvard school of public health had modeled the transmissibility

449
00:27:30.821 --> 00:27:32.780
patterns of the 1918 virus.

450
00:27:32.930 --> 00:27:37.740
More precisely they calculated its reproductive number are in relation to

451
00:27:37.880 --> 00:27:38.900
its serial interval.

452
00:27:39.420 --> 00:27:43.380
V the R number tells us how many secondary patients are produced by each primary

453
00:27:43.530 --> 00:27:44.350
patient.

454
00:27:44.350 --> 00:27:48.650
The V value is the average time expressed in days between a primary and a

455
00:27:48.651 --> 00:27:49.490
secondary case.

456
00:27:49.750 --> 00:27:54.690
The team evaluated that the 1919 virus had an R zero value of two

457
00:27:54.710 --> 00:27:56.050
to four in late terms,

458
00:27:56.070 --> 00:27:59.330
the infected patient could infect four more patients in less than a day.

459
00:27:59.560 --> 00:28:02.170
This may sound like a high rate of contagion. However,

460
00:28:02.430 --> 00:28:06.560
the researchers pointed out that this was not that high in relation to other

461
00:28:06.561 --> 00:28:08.920
influenza subtypes in their estimation,

462
00:28:09.040 --> 00:28:13.640
a similar pandemic could be prevented by vaccinating or administering antiviral

463
00:28:13.790 --> 00:28:18.720
prophylaxis to 50 to 75% of the population. And that sounds pretty easy,

464
00:28:18.820 --> 00:28:22.880
but it depends on how well prepared a national health system is when it comes to

465
00:28:22.881 --> 00:28:23.880
facing such emergencies,

466
00:28:24.400 --> 00:28:27.990
stock bowels of vaccines and antivirals may or may not be enough,

467
00:28:28.010 --> 00:28:30.430
or these drugs might not be available at all,

468
00:28:30.520 --> 00:28:33.390
still progressing through the early stages of a clinical trial.

469
00:28:33.540 --> 00:28:37.590
There's also the anti problem that flu viruses may be transmitted before the

470
00:28:37.680 --> 00:28:40.790
onset of defining signs and symptoms. In other words,

471
00:28:40.791 --> 00:28:44.070
people infect each other even before they appear to be sick,

472
00:28:45.480 --> 00:28:48.820
what's left to do well. Our quote directly from the clinical paper,

473
00:28:49.170 --> 00:28:52.980
this implies that measures that generally reduce contacts between persons,

474
00:28:52.981 --> 00:28:54.060
regardless of infection.

475
00:28:54.120 --> 00:28:59.100
Status may be our most powerful protection against a pandemic until adequate

476
00:28:59.101 --> 00:29:03.460
vaccine and antiviral medicines can be produced at which point mass vaccination

477
00:29:03.560 --> 00:29:08.130
and prophylaxis may be more if effective than targeted approaches and with

478
00:29:08.131 --> 00:29:10.930
what's going on in the world today, we hope that this video,

479
00:29:10.960 --> 00:29:14.850
this message perhaps has resonated with you. You've heard it a million times.

480
00:29:15.020 --> 00:29:17.930
We've all heard it until we are through this current emergency.

481
00:29:18.320 --> 00:29:22.770
Staying at home is our most powerful protection. Stay at home, stay safe,

482
00:29:23.340 --> 00:29:26.320
watch some biographics and thank you for watching. Okay.
