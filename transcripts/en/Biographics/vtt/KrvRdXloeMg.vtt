<v 1>Okay.</v>

00:00:19.970 --> 00:00:23.240
<v 0>It was a feudal leader who emerged as the leader of the odor clan during the</v>

9
00:00:23.241 --> 00:00:26.000
late 16th century. Once he was in power ODA,

10
00:00:26.001 --> 00:00:28.910
Nobunaga embarks on an ambitious plan. So once again,

11
00:00:28.911 --> 00:00:31.730
unite the entire country under the rule of a strong,

12
00:00:31.760 --> 00:00:34.670
determined and ruthless leader. Him,

13
00:00:34.730 --> 00:00:38.300
this was at a time when such a feat seemed almost impossible to accomplish

14
00:00:38.330 --> 00:00:40.910
Japan's authority had been completely decentralized.

15
00:00:40.911 --> 00:00:45.140
And although the country had an emperor render Shogun, neither one wielded,

16
00:00:45.141 --> 00:00:46.550
any real power. Instead,

17
00:00:46.551 --> 00:00:50.420
it had been disseminated among the dozens of Lords who constantly fought each

18
00:00:50.421 --> 00:00:53.960
other for territory gains the idea that one man would be able to bring them all

19
00:00:53.961 --> 00:00:58.640
under his control through alliances and through force seemed one destined to

20
00:00:58.641 --> 00:00:59.720
fail from the outset.

21
00:00:59.870 --> 00:01:04.490
And yet it happens ODA Nobunaga turns into the defacto leader of Japan by

22
00:01:04.670 --> 00:01:07.190
becoming the most powerful Lord in the country,

23
00:01:07.220 --> 00:01:11.870
but he never got to actually rule it as has of a new central governments because

24
00:01:11.871 --> 00:01:14.540
he fell victim to betrayal. Before this could happen,

25
00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:18.800
the mission then fell upon two of his most trusted allies who took the plan of

26
00:01:18.801 --> 00:01:21.140
ODA Nobunaga to completion and together,

27
00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:24.260
they became known as the three great unifies of Japan.

28
00:01:25.550 --> 00:01:26.383
<v 1>Uh.</v>

29
00:01:30.380 --> 00:01:33.590
<v 0>In order to get a better sense of ODA Nobunaga's reign and his impact on the</v>

30
00:01:33.591 --> 00:01:34.430
history of Japan.

31
00:01:34.431 --> 00:01:37.910
We should first start with a quick look at the state of the country itself.

32
00:01:37.911 --> 00:01:41.960
During the 16th century, our story takes place during the Shogun era of Japan,

33
00:01:41.961 --> 00:01:46.220
a time period that lasted almost 700 years until the Meiji restoration of

34
00:01:46.221 --> 00:01:48.080
1868. During this age,

35
00:01:48.081 --> 00:01:51.680
the emperor of Japan still existed and was theoretically the head of state,

36
00:01:51.710 --> 00:01:55.520
but he had no real power. It was more of a ceremonial title.

37
00:01:55.550 --> 00:01:59.150
The defective leader of Japan was a military dictator called a Shogun.

38
00:01:59.330 --> 00:02:03.590
He exerted his power over all of the provinces of the country by points in

39
00:02:04.100 --> 00:02:07.640
governor's called Shu to handle the day-to-day operations over centuries.

40
00:02:07.641 --> 00:02:11.660
This position evolved and was eventually replaced by dime yo a much more

41
00:02:11.661 --> 00:02:15.860
powerful feudal Lord who had actual authority and ownership over his lands while

42
00:02:15.861 --> 00:02:20.630
still retaining certain obligations and responsibilities towards his Shogun to

43
00:02:20.631 --> 00:02:25.400
make matters even more chaotic ODA Nobunaga lived during the Singani periods.

44
00:02:25.400 --> 00:02:27.680
Also known as the age of warring States,

45
00:02:27.681 --> 00:02:31.670
one of the most violent and most unstable periods in Japanese history.

46
00:02:31.850 --> 00:02:33.050
At the outset of this period,

47
00:02:33.051 --> 00:02:36.920
the Shogun had lost most of the authority that he used to have over his dying

48
00:02:36.921 --> 00:02:40.790
years. This triggered a civil war or the Onin war in 1467,

49
00:02:40.940 --> 00:02:45.200
which plunged Japan into a 150 year long power struggle between the country's

50
00:02:45.201 --> 00:02:48.740
most dominant dinos. While this resulted in a loss of battles,

51
00:02:48.741 --> 00:02:51.380
conspiracies and civil Wars, no single dime,

52
00:02:51.590 --> 00:02:55.130
yo proved himself strong enough to permanently defeat his enemies and rule over

53
00:02:55.340 --> 00:02:58.940
a United Japan. Once more, nobody that is until ODA.

54
00:03:05.880 --> 00:03:08.790
I don't have an AGA was born on June the 23rd, 1534,

55
00:03:08.940 --> 00:03:12.300
somewhere in the Ord province. Most likely the city of [inaudible].

56
00:03:12.480 --> 00:03:16.920
He was the oldest son of [inaudible] and his wife daughter goes in,

57
00:03:16.980 --> 00:03:20.970
although Nobel Hedy also had an older legitimate son named Odin Nobel hero.

58
00:03:21.500 --> 00:03:23.400
Nobody. He was the leader of the ODA clan.

59
00:03:23.401 --> 00:03:26.760
And just to clarify Japanese names to start with the family name first,

60
00:03:26.761 --> 00:03:31.260
which in this case is odor speaking of names when he was a child Nobunaga was

61
00:03:31.261 --> 00:03:33.780
actually called kapashi naming conventions of feudal.

62
00:03:33.781 --> 00:03:37.710
Japan are quite complex for the upper classes and as they changed their names,

63
00:03:37.711 --> 00:03:41.640
at least once during their lifetimes and even up to four or five times,

64
00:03:41.940 --> 00:03:44.430
boys started out with a yo-yo meaning youth name,

65
00:03:44.431 --> 00:03:48.750
which later changed to the Amena or true name when they were teenagers as part

66
00:03:48.751 --> 00:03:51.900
of their passing into manhood. Then there was also the hereditary title,

67
00:03:51.930 --> 00:03:53.580
the clan name and to the pseudonym,

68
00:03:53.730 --> 00:03:56.610
but let's keep it simple and stick with ODA Nobunaga.

69
00:03:56.640 --> 00:04:00.120
Since that is the name that most people are familiar with during his time,

70
00:04:00.121 --> 00:04:03.360
Japan was theoretically ruled by the Ashikaga Shogun AIDS.

71
00:04:03.361 --> 00:04:05.220
Although this was just nominally,

72
00:04:05.280 --> 00:04:08.580
even though the Ashikaga had been in power since the mid 14th century,

73
00:04:08.610 --> 00:04:10.860
they never really owns that much personal territory.

74
00:04:10.920 --> 00:04:13.800
This is not ideal when you want to operate a military dictatorship.

75
00:04:13.801 --> 00:04:18.060
So the Ashikaga will always rely on the loyalty of that dinos over the

76
00:04:18.061 --> 00:04:21.000
235 years that this Shogun stayed in power.

77
00:04:21.150 --> 00:04:24.810
The influence and authority of the Damian Lords kept increasing creating a

78
00:04:24.811 --> 00:04:28.530
situation where some clans easily equal the Shogun eight in power,

79
00:04:28.590 --> 00:04:30.960
even though technically they were still subservience.

80
00:04:31.140 --> 00:04:34.890
Obviously it was only a matter of time until somebody came along with ambitions

81
00:04:34.891 --> 00:04:38.250
of conquest to put the strength of the shogunate to the test.

82
00:04:38.310 --> 00:04:42.120
The main reason why it took so long for a dime year to challenge the Shogun was

83
00:04:42.300 --> 00:04:45.720
because they were always busy fighting among themselves during Naheed days.

84
00:04:46.020 --> 00:04:50.130
Rain, the ODA clan was mainly preoccupied with neighboring cyto and

85
00:04:52.470 --> 00:04:53.880
[inaudible] was weaker than his opponents,

86
00:04:53.881 --> 00:04:58.160
mainly due to internal strife inside his own clan and was defeated by each one

87
00:04:58.230 --> 00:04:59.400
in battle because of this,

88
00:04:59.401 --> 00:05:03.450
he decided to make peace with the scientific clan and did leader cyto docent by

89
00:05:03.451 --> 00:05:07.710
marrying Nobunaga to docents daughter and a He-Man better known as the lady.

90
00:05:07.920 --> 00:05:10.920
Now, this all is known about her and the ultimate fate is on certain,

91
00:05:10.921 --> 00:05:15.080
but we do know that she and that were Naga were never close because lady knew

92
00:05:15.120 --> 00:05:17.570
could not give them any children. After he became diamond.

93
00:05:17.571 --> 00:05:22.170
Nobunaga lavished much more attention on one of his concubines named Kitsilano

94
00:05:22.171 --> 00:05:25.230
who gave him his first son, ODA Novo, Tada.

95
00:05:31.440 --> 00:05:32.160
<v 1>We're getting.</v>

96
00:05:32.160 --> 00:05:36.120
<v 0>A bit ahead of ourselves at the moment. No day was still head of the odor clan,</v>

97
00:05:36.121 --> 00:05:40.650
but he died suddenly in 1550, one aged, only 40 or 41 years old.

98
00:05:40.890 --> 00:05:42.930
There was already some internal fighting going on,

99
00:05:42.931 --> 00:05:46.940
but his death created a succession crisis. Nobo hero is Nova Mohita.

100
00:05:46.950 --> 00:05:49.800
His eldest son wanted to succeed him as head of the clan,

101
00:05:49.801 --> 00:05:52.620
but because he was a legitimate, it's not many supported his claim.

102
00:05:52.621 --> 00:05:56.490
And he immediately suffered a defeat against the Imigawa clan,

103
00:05:56.520 --> 00:06:00.500
which caused everyone to lose whatever confidence they had in him to begin with.

104
00:06:00.560 --> 00:06:04.130
It would have made the most sense for Nobunaga to follow his father's footsteps,

105
00:06:04.131 --> 00:06:06.920
but he also lost the support of many of Nobel heaters,

106
00:06:06.921 --> 00:06:10.580
retainers being spoiled and done disciplines. According to legend,

107
00:06:10.581 --> 00:06:12.620
he behaved very poorly at his father's funeral.

108
00:06:12.621 --> 00:06:15.740
And this lack of respect made many former vassals of Noah.

109
00:06:16.100 --> 00:06:19.970
HIDA prefer that his younger son odor Nova Yuki would succeed him as head of the

110
00:06:20.330 --> 00:06:20.590
clan.

111
00:06:20.590 --> 00:06:25.420
Linda was Nobel Hedy's brother odor Novo Tomo who made it play for himself as

112
00:06:25.421 --> 00:06:27.550
the new clan leader in the outside world.

113
00:06:27.551 --> 00:06:31.660
The ODA clans newest Dalai cyto dos and was facing a threat of his own.

114
00:06:31.661 --> 00:06:32.800
When his son's cyto.

115
00:06:32.801 --> 00:06:37.780
You should ask Sue staged a coup assassinated his own du brothers and waged war

116
00:06:37.781 --> 00:06:40.960
against his father for leadership of the Sci-Tech clan. Lastly,

117
00:06:41.110 --> 00:06:45.100
let's not forget that the odor clan was still at war with the Imigawa clan led

118
00:06:45.101 --> 00:06:47.920
by Emma Galois Yoshimoto. As you can see,

119
00:06:47.921 --> 00:06:51.310
the warring States period of Japan certainly lived up to its name.

120
00:06:51.370 --> 00:06:54.550
It was full of treachery violence and one battle after another,

121
00:06:54.730 --> 00:06:58.750
in a constant struggle for power and somehow ODA Nobunaga was the one who

122
00:06:58.751 --> 00:06:59.830
managed to reach the top.

123
00:06:59.950 --> 00:07:03.730
It's hard to say exactly what were his keys to success because he was never

124
00:07:03.731 --> 00:07:07.180
portrayed as some kind of military genius. And in his youth,

125
00:07:07.181 --> 00:07:11.140
at least he was shown to be some undisciplined brat who didn't even want to

126
00:07:11.141 --> 00:07:13.420
assume leadership of the ODA clan, less alone,

127
00:07:13.421 --> 00:07:17.350
set himself on a path to conquer all of Japan as positive the legends

128
00:07:17.351 --> 00:07:19.960
surrounding Nobunaga it, it says this an episode,

129
00:07:19.961 --> 00:07:23.410
which had a profound effect on him occurred when his former tutor a samurai

130
00:07:23.411 --> 00:07:28.270
named Hirata and Massey HIDA committed seppuku out of shame of how his pupil act

131
00:07:28.480 --> 00:07:28.510
is.

132
00:07:28.510 --> 00:07:32.110
This was supposedly what prompted Nobunaga to straighten up and take his role

133
00:07:32.111 --> 00:07:35.020
seriously, but it is likely only a story.

134
00:07:35.170 --> 00:07:39.700
There is a death of contemporary sources on ODA Nobunaga and those that

135
00:07:39.701 --> 00:07:41.740
exist have been greatly exaggerated,

136
00:07:41.741 --> 00:07:44.920
making it hard to get a sense of the real man behind the legends.

137
00:07:44.950 --> 00:07:48.130
Perhaps the best description we have comes courtesy of Portuguese missionary,

138
00:07:48.610 --> 00:07:49.120
Louis FRA,

139
00:07:49.120 --> 00:07:52.960
who became a close friends with the Lord and even stayed at his residence for a

140
00:07:52.961 --> 00:07:55.600
while. Decades often Nobunaga became dime yoke.

141
00:07:55.630 --> 00:07:57.880
He described Nobunaga as a tall man,

142
00:07:57.910 --> 00:08:00.910
thin scantily bidded with a very clear voice,

143
00:08:00.940 --> 00:08:05.590
much given to the practice of arms Hottie funds of the exercise of justice and

144
00:08:05.591 --> 00:08:07.810
of mercy. Prouds. I love her on, uh,

145
00:08:07.870 --> 00:08:11.980
to the uttermost very secretive and what he determines extremely shrewd in the

146
00:08:12.100 --> 00:08:14.650
stratagems of war little, if at all,

147
00:08:14.651 --> 00:08:19.120
subject to the reproof and council of his subordinates feared and revered by all

148
00:08:19.121 --> 00:08:21.400
to an extreme degree does not drink wine.

149
00:08:21.460 --> 00:08:25.870
He is a severe master treats all the Kings and princes of Japan with scorn and

150
00:08:25.930 --> 00:08:30.220
speaks to them over his shoulder as though to inferiors and is completely obeyed

151
00:08:30.250 --> 00:08:32.800
by all as that absolute Lord. Now,

152
00:08:32.830 --> 00:08:34.600
just before we get into the rest of today's video,

153
00:08:34.601 --> 00:08:37.510
I do want to take a quick moment to tell you about today's sponsor Squarespace.

154
00:08:37.520 --> 00:08:38.860
Now, a couple of simple things,

155
00:08:38.890 --> 00:08:42.370
maybe you've got an idea for a website or a business that you want to start or

156
00:08:42.371 --> 00:08:45.820
something in your mind. You're thinking maybe I should try that. Well, too.

157
00:08:46.030 --> 00:08:48.730
The only way to find out whether that's a good idea is to get it out there to

158
00:08:48.731 --> 00:08:49.091
the world.

159
00:08:49.091 --> 00:08:52.600
And this can be daunting because it's scary to go and pursue new things,

160
00:08:52.810 --> 00:08:55.620
but not knowing how to set up a website is not excuse.

161
00:08:55.621 --> 00:08:58.020
There are no excuses available with Squarespace.

162
00:08:58.050 --> 00:09:01.080
Squarespace allows you to create a powerful website for whatever you're up to.

163
00:09:01.290 --> 00:09:04.740
We want to sell something online. Yes. Set up a store with Squarespace.

164
00:09:04.920 --> 00:09:08.280
You want to start a podcast? Absolutely. You can do that too.

Naga to fulfill his ambitions.

180
00:10:00.861 --> 00:10:04.160
He had to assume uncontested control of the ODA clan,

181
00:10:04.161 --> 00:10:06.590
which meant dealing with his younger brother and his uncle.

182
00:10:06.620 --> 00:10:11.270
First up was his uncle ODA Novo Tomo who had taken control of Kiyosaki castle in

183
00:10:11.271 --> 00:10:15.950
1553 and had the support of the Sheba plan of Matsu province.

184
00:10:15.980 --> 00:10:20.180
Despite this Nobunaga had no real difficulty in this basil. And in 1555,

185
00:10:20.181 --> 00:10:22.790
he captured his uncle who was forced to commit suicide.

186
00:10:23.540 --> 00:10:28.010
Nobunaga's then relocated to Nagoya castle making Kiyosumi his new base of

187
00:10:28.011 --> 00:10:28.910
operations.

188
00:10:29.240 --> 00:10:32.990
ODA noble Yorkie proved more difficult to submit because he had more retainers

189
00:10:32.991 --> 00:10:36.440
on his side who still viewed him as the best candidate to take over the clan.

190
00:10:36.470 --> 00:10:40.040
The two sides met in battle in 1556 on the, in a plane,

191
00:10:40.100 --> 00:10:41.660
despite being heavily outnumbered.

192
00:10:41.930 --> 00:10:45.650
Another Naga was victorious and afterwards even forgave his brothers and his

193
00:10:45.651 --> 00:10:49.640
retainers, mostly due to the pleading of his mother, Dota goes in even.

194
00:10:49.640 --> 00:10:53.900
So nobody Yorkie did not stop plotting against his brother and intended to rise

195
00:10:53.901 --> 00:10:57.020
up against him once more when he was not expecting it. However,

196
00:10:57.170 --> 00:11:00.920
his retainers proved to be a bit more honorable than he gave them credit for

197
00:11:01.100 --> 00:11:03.590
after being defeated, they swore their loyalty is a NABA.

198
00:11:03.591 --> 00:11:07.820
Naga runs intended to keep this oath. Nova Yorkie informed them of his plans.

199
00:11:07.821 --> 00:11:12.680
And one of them named Shibata cat Sui tolls Nobunaga of his brother's treachery.

200
00:11:12.710 --> 00:11:15.740
This time, the leader of the ODA clan could no longer forgive his brother.

201
00:11:15.741 --> 00:11:20.270
So he had to know where Yorkie assassinated at kiosk to console in 1557.

202
00:11:20.300 --> 00:11:24.290
By this point, Noah Naga was pretty firmly in control of his own clan.

203
00:11:24.300 --> 00:11:28.070
So it was time to expand his attention to his neighbors, his ally,

204
00:11:28.071 --> 00:11:32.600
and father-in-law cyto dos and died at the battle of nag or a river in

205
00:11:33.620 --> 00:11:34.910
1556. I just treacherous on Yosha.

206
00:11:34.911 --> 00:11:39.650
Tatsu became the new leader of the clan besides wanting to avenge dos and Noah

207
00:11:39.651 --> 00:11:40.070
Naga.

208
00:11:40.070 --> 00:11:44.270
Also might've had a rightful claim to his lands is the old man allegedly named

209
00:11:44.271 --> 00:11:47.450
his son-in-law was his main beneficiary and his will.

210
00:11:47.690 --> 00:11:49.340
And the new Lord of the Mino province.

211
00:11:49.400 --> 00:11:52.670
Nobunaga tried to defeat Yasha Tatsu in battle several times,

212
00:11:52.671 --> 00:11:54.850
but the lots have proved to be a wealthy folk.

213
00:11:55.060 --> 00:11:58.750
Although successful in combat the leader of the [inaudible] clan was taken down

214
00:11:58.751 --> 00:12:02.470
by an unexpected foe, an illness that killed him in 1561,

215
00:12:02.690 --> 00:12:06.910
just age 35. He was succeeded by his son, cytotoxic chokey,

216
00:12:06.940 --> 00:12:10.510
who was young and experienced and completely unprepared for the new role that

217
00:12:10.511 --> 00:12:13.600
was forced upon him. He managed to hold his own for a few years,

218
00:12:13.601 --> 00:12:17.080
but the cyto grant soon became irrelevant in the power struggle going on in the

219
00:12:17.081 --> 00:12:18.160
country. Finally,

220
00:12:18.161 --> 00:12:22.150
Nobunaga defeated him conclusively at the siege of inner Bayamo castle in

221
00:12:22.151 --> 00:12:25.360
1567 and the Sci-Tech clan disappeared for him.

222
00:12:32.100 --> 00:12:32.610
<v 2>Nope.</v>

223
00:12:32.610 --> 00:12:37.290
<v 0>Still had one more enemy to deal with Imigawa Yoshimoto and he was the most</v>

224
00:12:37.291 --> 00:12:41.640
powerful of all. Also aided by the matzoh direct clown of Macau province,

225
00:12:41.641 --> 00:12:46.080
which was a long-standing enemy of the odor in 1560 Yoshimoto assembles,

226
00:12:46.081 --> 00:12:49.530
a long army of 25,000 mens, a March on the Capitol of Kyoto,

227
00:12:49.800 --> 00:12:51.600
the seat of power of the Shogun AIDS,

228
00:12:51.810 --> 00:12:56.160
his exact intentions have never been made clear and have only been speculated by

229
00:12:56.161 --> 00:12:57.090
later historians.

230
00:12:57.120 --> 00:13:01.260
Some believe he only wants it an official sanction from the shoguns legitimize,

231
00:13:01.261 --> 00:13:04.860
his actions against Theo to clan while others thought he or she Moto might've

232
00:13:04.861 --> 00:13:08.880
intended to bring down the Shogun at itself on the way that he entered a watery

233
00:13:08.881 --> 00:13:09.361
province,

234
00:13:09.361 --> 00:13:12.870
which belonged to the ODA clan and began plundering and capturing castles.

235
00:13:12.960 --> 00:13:14.460
Following the siege of marinade,

236
00:13:14.490 --> 00:13:18.990
the Matsudaira clan managed to seize the strongest of Nobunaga's fortresses in

237
00:13:18.991 --> 00:13:21.660
the region. Obviously the odor clan had to respond,

238
00:13:21.690 --> 00:13:25.290
but nobody knowing his forces were only a small fraction of Yashi motos.

239
00:13:25.560 --> 00:13:28.140
He may have had around 5,000 men at his disposal,

240
00:13:28.141 --> 00:13:32.010
but some still have to be left behind to defends the other properties in a

241
00:13:32.460 --> 00:13:32.730
warrior.

242
00:13:32.730 --> 00:13:36.150
I had an attack would have been suicide and does advise is warmed up to fall,

243
00:13:36.151 --> 00:13:39.930
back to Keo SU Casa Lynn's prepare for a siege Nobanaga however,

244
00:13:40.110 --> 00:13:43.710
it felt that such a move would only delay that downfall and that their only

245
00:13:43.711 --> 00:13:46.350
chance was a strong and unexpected counter attack,

246
00:13:46.410 --> 00:13:49.830
which happens at the battle of Oka Hosanna in June,

247
00:13:49.830 --> 00:13:53.280
1560 Yoshimoto in his army set up camp at the foot of Mount Hazara.

248
00:13:53.520 --> 00:13:55.530
On the day of the attack, as men were busy,

249
00:13:55.531 --> 00:13:58.290
celebrating their victories with cheers and Sockeye. Well,

250
00:13:58.440 --> 00:14:01.740
the [inaudible] was allegedly entertaining himself by inspecting the heads of

251
00:14:01.741 --> 00:14:02.251
his enemies,

252
00:14:02.251 --> 00:14:06.180
which he had collected during this time Nobunaga runs around 2000 of his men

253
00:14:06.181 --> 00:14:10.080
managed to sneak their way into the nearby Nakashima fortress undetected.

254
00:14:10.140 --> 00:14:13.590
Allegedly the older leader went to great lengths to make his enemies thing that

255
00:14:13.591 --> 00:14:14.640
he was someplace else.

256
00:14:14.641 --> 00:14:17.970
Even if it means giving up a significant part of his already small army,

257
00:14:18.120 --> 00:14:22.020
he sent hundreds of soldiers to lay siege on the roomy castle while others were

258
00:14:22.021 --> 00:14:22.501
stationed.

259
00:14:22.501 --> 00:14:26.070
There were a temple with lots of flags and banners to exaggerate the numbers in

260
00:14:26.071 --> 00:14:28.310
case an enemy scalps spotted them. Undoubtedly,

261
00:14:28.380 --> 00:14:31.200
it was also assisted by a large storm, which hit the camp that day,

262
00:14:31.201 --> 00:14:34.440
making it much harder for Yoshimoto his men to spot their enemy when the

263
00:14:34.441 --> 00:14:38.010
downpour ended Nobunaga and his men challenged into the unsuspecting camp and

264
00:14:38.011 --> 00:14:42.150
attacked this caused immediate Mehan and confusion and allegedly Yoshimoto

265
00:14:42.151 --> 00:14:46.830
himself was so taken aback that he initially believed drunken brawl had erupted

266
00:14:46.831 --> 00:14:49.140
between his men. By the time he realized what was happening,

267
00:14:49.141 --> 00:14:51.210
it was too late to organize any sort of defense.

268
00:14:51.410 --> 00:14:55.280
The soldiers of the Imigawa clan were fleeing for their lives in every direction

269
00:14:55.281 --> 00:14:59.480
while Yoshimoto himself was attacked and killed by two of Nobunaga samurai.

270
00:14:59.590 --> 00:15:04.220
And that Tori cuts Tata and Maury or HSA katsu, ODA Nobunaga returns,

271
00:15:04.221 --> 00:15:08.900
triumphant Tokyo suit castle with his vanquished foes had proudly on display.

272
00:15:09.080 --> 00:15:12.200
This was a major shift in the balance of power. Prior to this battle,

273
00:15:12.380 --> 00:15:16.010
there was a real chance that our worry province would fall completely in the

274
00:15:16.011 --> 00:15:20.210
hands of the amygdala clan. While the ODA clan might have disappeared forever.

275
00:15:20.390 --> 00:15:23.300
Now, ODA Nobunaga was one of the most powerful,

276
00:15:23.301 --> 00:15:26.150
most respected and most feared warlords in the country.

277
00:15:26.420 --> 00:15:27.410
And he samurai in his mind,

278
00:15:27.411 --> 00:15:31.400
a diamond has pledged their allegiance to Nobunaga including his former enemies

279
00:15:31.790 --> 00:15:32.900
Matsudaira clan.

280
00:15:33.020 --> 00:15:37.100
They were led by matzoh Diara Mata Jasu to become one of Nobunaga's strongest

281
00:15:37.101 --> 00:15:38.090
allies later on,

282
00:15:38.091 --> 00:15:41.750
he would change his name to talk with Galileo Sue and who would play just as

283
00:15:41.751 --> 00:15:45.200
important to roll in Japan's unification this Oh, to Nova Naga,

284
00:15:45.320 --> 00:15:46.610
but that's a story for another day.

285
00:15:46.900 --> 00:15:47.733
<v 3>Yeah.</v>

286
00:15:54.140 --> 00:15:57.970
<v 0>1868 Golden opportunity presented itself to Nobunaga during the previous years,</v>

287
00:15:57.971 --> 00:16:00.550
while the ODA Demio was busy, fighting his enemies,

288
00:16:00.730 --> 00:16:04.150
the show guns had their own problems and conspiracies to deal with when this

289
00:16:04.151 --> 00:16:08.260
whole thing started, the Shogun of Japan was Ashikaga Yasha, Terri 13,

290
00:16:08.261 --> 00:16:11.800
the Shogun of the Ashikaga dynasty. However, in 1565,

291
00:16:11.830 --> 00:16:14.020
he was slaying in basil by a group of dinos.

292
00:16:14.110 --> 00:16:16.300
He wanted to install his cousin as Chicago,

293
00:16:16.301 --> 00:16:21.220
Yara Shahidi as the new Shogun who would basically serve as that puppet like we

294
00:16:21.221 --> 00:16:23.110
previously mentioned. But at this point in the show,

295
00:16:23.111 --> 00:16:25.630
grenades was a mere shell of what it used to be.

296
00:16:25.810 --> 00:16:28.750
And the Shogun himself was only as powerful as the dime.

297
00:16:28.990 --> 00:16:30.160
You're willing to go to war for him.

298
00:16:30.220 --> 00:16:33.820
Not everyone was cool with Yasha HIDA as the new Shogun.

299
00:16:34.000 --> 00:16:38.410
And among those people was Yoshiaki the younger brother of the 13th Shogun who

300
00:16:38.411 --> 00:16:41.110
was betrayed and kills. He wants it, his revenge,

301
00:16:41.111 --> 00:16:43.060
and also wants to take back the show grenades,

302
00:16:43.270 --> 00:16:46.290
but then he needed the support of a strong and respected Diageo.

303
00:16:46.291 --> 00:16:48.970
And there was no better candidates than odor Nova Naga.

304
00:16:49.000 --> 00:16:53.710
The leader of the ODA clan was perfectly happy to assist Yoshiaki with this task

305
00:16:53.711 --> 00:16:58.060
because after all the new Shogun would be his puppets and Nova Naga would be the

306
00:16:58.061 --> 00:17:00.610
true leader of the country. In 1568,

307
00:17:00.640 --> 00:17:02.650
they marched on Kyoto with their main obstacle,

308
00:17:02.651 --> 00:17:05.110
being the rock of clan of army province,

309
00:17:05.140 --> 00:17:08.290
neither rock Akron or any of the other clans, however,

310
00:17:08.470 --> 00:17:10.420
proved able to stop Noah Naga.

311
00:17:10.421 --> 00:17:14.560
And by the end of the war Ashikaga Yoshiaki was the new Shogun. However,

312
00:17:14.590 --> 00:17:16.660
this Alliance only lasted for a few years.

313
00:17:16.810 --> 00:17:21.400
Yoshiaki soon grew to resent his position and his dependency on Nobanaga ruins

314
00:17:21.401 --> 00:17:22.630
began plotting against him.

315
00:17:22.840 --> 00:17:26.560
He found plenty of co-conspirators as there was certainly no absence of

316
00:17:27.280 --> 00:17:30.070
[inaudible] begrudge the ever-increasing power of the ODA clan.

317
00:17:30.130 --> 00:17:31.420
There's never led anywhere. However,

318
00:17:31.421 --> 00:17:35.530
because when Nobunaga had had enough of Yoshiaki Jackie's intrigue see easily

319
00:17:35.531 --> 00:17:39.550
deposed him in 1573, thus putting an ends to not only as rain,

320
00:17:39.551 --> 00:17:42.100
but to the entire Chicago Shogun eight. Mm.

321
00:17:48.100 --> 00:17:50.040
<v 3>During the years of Yankees rain.</v>

322
00:17:50.040 --> 00:17:52.800
<v 0>The Shogun was the least of Nobunaga's worries.</v>

323
00:17:52.980 --> 00:17:57.180
Virtually every clan leader who was outside his sphere of loyalty and influence

324
00:17:57.181 --> 00:18:01.170
began seeing the odor clan as a powerful enemy and unsurprisingly,

325
00:18:01.200 --> 00:18:03.870
many of them wanted to put a stop to Nobunaga's rise.

326
00:18:04.080 --> 00:18:08.280
It would take far too long to talk about each one here as there were dozens of

327
00:18:08.281 --> 00:18:11.700
clans, both big and small, which opposed the odor leader.

328
00:18:11.730 --> 00:18:14.130
So we'll focus only on the major events.

329
00:18:14.131 --> 00:18:17.370
And we'll start with the battle of Antigua. In 1570,

330
00:18:17.460 --> 00:18:19.170
the fight was the high points of the conflict,

331
00:18:19.171 --> 00:18:22.980
but we know a Naga and the asset Cora clan of each of them province.

332
00:18:23.010 --> 00:18:26.070
One of his strongest foes earlier that same year,

333
00:18:26.370 --> 00:18:31.140
nobody Naga had invited each sin and captured one of the asset Cora castles.

334
00:18:31.230 --> 00:18:32.640
He had declared advantage,

335
00:18:32.670 --> 00:18:36.120
but received words that nearby our side clown had betrayed him.

336
00:18:36.170 --> 00:18:39.570
That's when now coming from behind to trap him, no, a Naga had no choice,

337
00:18:39.571 --> 00:18:40.171
but to retreat,

338
00:18:40.171 --> 00:18:44.550
to Kyoto it previously allied himself to the OSI plan through marriage.

339
00:18:44.580 --> 00:18:47.880
But their relationship with Assa Gara went back decades.

340
00:18:47.881 --> 00:18:51.900
So perhaps it was a bit foolish of NABA Naga to expect them to choose him over

341
00:18:52.080 --> 00:18:56.340
their much older allies, either way in July 15, 17, he launched a new attack.

342
00:18:56.420 --> 00:18:59.520
Cause this time on the OSI stronghold of Adani castle,

343
00:18:59.850 --> 00:19:03.480
he met his enemies in battle and a golfer and scored a significant win.

344
00:19:03.481 --> 00:19:07.230
But the castle remained in the hands of the aside while this was an important

345
00:19:07.231 --> 00:19:09.840
victory that turns the tide in the favor of Nova nugget.

346
00:19:09.990 --> 00:19:14.520
It was by no means the end of his war with the OSI and as Cora clans,

347
00:19:14.610 --> 00:19:16.350
it wasn't until 1573,

348
00:19:16.470 --> 00:19:21.090
the Nobunaga led successful seizures on that consoles forcing his enemy plan

349
00:19:21.120 --> 00:19:22.560
leaders to commit suicide.

350
00:19:22.620 --> 00:19:26.280
The greatest fear of the odor clan during this time was Takita Shingon leader of

351
00:19:26.281 --> 00:19:30.900
the Takita clan of CAI province and Lord of the famous group of skilled military

352
00:19:30.901 --> 00:19:33.120
commanders dubbed the 24 generals.

353
00:19:33.150 --> 00:19:37.860
One of these men of samurai named Yama Nova Tomo showed his value by

354
00:19:37.861 --> 00:19:41.480
taking one of Nobunaga's strongholds era, more, a castle without shedding,

355
00:19:41.490 --> 00:19:44.190
a drop of blood. Instead he convinced the lady of the castle.

356
00:19:44.191 --> 00:19:48.900
No inaug arms lady [inaudible] to betray her Lord surrender to the castle and

357
00:19:48.901 --> 00:19:50.820
accepts Nova tomorrow's hand in marriage.

358
00:19:51.300 --> 00:19:55.200
Often this events and other Naga had no choice, but to engage Takita in war,

359
00:19:55.260 --> 00:20:00.060
the two sides fought in early 1573 at the battle of [inaudible] and

360
00:20:00.090 --> 00:20:03.690
surprise, surprise Takita one indecisive fashion for a while,

361
00:20:03.691 --> 00:20:07.470
it looked like taquito Shingon would be the one to finally put an end to

362
00:20:07.471 --> 00:20:11.730
Nobunaga's ambitions. And we would probably be doing a video about him today.

363
00:20:11.910 --> 00:20:16.320
If fortune did not smile upon ODA Nobunaga once more after his victory,

364
00:20:16.500 --> 00:20:19.500
it's nicotine Hora Takita press. The attack is invaded.

365
00:20:19.501 --> 00:20:21.420
One of Nobunaga's provinces there,

366
00:20:21.421 --> 00:20:25.590
he set up camp and then he died of an unknown illness afterwards,

367
00:20:25.920 --> 00:20:28.560
tacky to his Casio, or he became leader of the clan,

368
00:20:28.740 --> 00:20:31.890
but he was nowhere near as skilled or experienced as his father.

369
00:20:32.100 --> 00:20:35.880
That's only turned firmly and no one August favor following his decisive victory

370
00:20:35.881 --> 00:20:38.430
at the battle of Nagesh Chino in 1575.

371
00:20:38.460 --> 00:20:43.170
And he wiped out the Takita clan completely at the 1582 battle of 10

372
00:20:43.490 --> 00:20:46.860
MACUSA Cruzan where cat, Sierra and committed suicide. Besides the other clans,

373
00:20:46.890 --> 00:20:51.520
ODA Naga also count a powerful enemy in the form of Buddhism warrior,

374
00:20:51.521 --> 00:20:55.630
amongst belonging to a sect called shin Buddhism to be exact ever since he took

375
00:20:55.631 --> 00:20:58.540
power. Nobunaga full to movement called echo EQI,

376
00:20:58.541 --> 00:21:02.350
which consisted of Buddhist commoners, who opposed the rule of dinos.

377
00:21:02.410 --> 00:21:04.720
He burned down their temples and executed that priests,

378
00:21:04.721 --> 00:21:08.080
but they remained a thorn in his side until his death.

379
00:21:14.430 --> 00:21:15.210
<v 3>[Inaudible].</v>

380
00:21:15.210 --> 00:21:17.400
<v 0>Almost constant threats of Nobunaga's authority.</v>

381
00:21:17.430 --> 00:21:20.070
He was the defacto leader of Japan for over a decade.

382
00:21:20.071 --> 00:21:23.610
Although we should make it clear that he never actually succeeded in unifying

383
00:21:23.611 --> 00:21:25.230
the entire country under his rule.

384
00:21:25.410 --> 00:21:28.680
He was on his way to accomplishing this goal where it not for the treachery.

385
00:21:28.681 --> 00:21:32.670
He suffered at the hands of one of his samurai called [inaudible].

386
00:21:32.850 --> 00:21:35.160
The reason behind the Kiki's betrayal is uncertain.

387
00:21:35.161 --> 00:21:38.340
Although common theories claim that it happens because of MITSA HiTA his

388
00:21:38.341 --> 00:21:40.740
personal animosity towards his dime you,

389
00:21:41.010 --> 00:21:43.260
or because he wanted to restore the emperor to power.

390
00:21:43.380 --> 00:21:46.260
One popular story involves one of Nobunaga's enemies.

391
00:21:46.261 --> 00:21:51.150
The Tano had a HARO liter of hatano clan of tambour province after Mitzi,

392
00:21:51.270 --> 00:21:54.450
who defeated him in battle. The samurai brought a Tano before his Lord,

393
00:21:54.451 --> 00:21:57.630
after having promised in protection in exchange for his surrender.

394
00:21:57.690 --> 00:22:01.350
Nobunaga however, how Caetano executed anyway, blaming a catchy fullness,

395
00:22:01.800 --> 00:22:03.300
betrayal, platanos, retainers, kidnapped,

396
00:22:03.301 --> 00:22:06.130
and murdered his mother as punishment while we don't know whether this is true

397
00:22:06.270 --> 00:22:06.510
on us,

398
00:22:06.510 --> 00:22:10.470
it fits with Nobunaga's reputation of being ruthless towards his enemies and

399
00:22:10.740 --> 00:22:12.930
indifferent to the problems of his own men.

400
00:22:12.930 --> 00:22:16.500
And it certainly gave Mitsui day a good reason to turn on his master.

401
00:22:16.620 --> 00:22:20.680
It was June, 1582. Nobanaga had just wiped out the Takita clan.

402
00:22:20.710 --> 00:22:22.500
One of his most dangerous adversaries.

403
00:22:22.560 --> 00:22:25.020
He was feeling confident and he was feeling safe.

404
00:22:25.080 --> 00:22:28.830
Most of his army accompanied Docker [inaudible] in another region while ODA

405
00:22:28.831 --> 00:22:32.550
Nobunaga traveled to Kyoto with only a small retinue of servants and court

406
00:22:32.551 --> 00:22:35.910
officials, hearing of this, it catching it's heat, a sore, his opportunity.

407
00:22:36.150 --> 00:22:39.090
He assembled an army of 13,000 men and marched on Kyoto.

408
00:22:39.150 --> 00:22:42.990
They arrived on June the 21st and surrounded the Honnoji temple.

409
00:22:42.991 --> 00:22:46.500
When Onaga was located. He only had a few dozen guards with him.

410
00:22:46.501 --> 00:22:48.420
So there was really no chance of victory,

411
00:22:48.690 --> 00:22:51.780
nor was there any way to stall while waiting for reinforcements.

412
00:22:51.930 --> 00:22:55.710
As the temple arounds him burned to the ground ODA Nobunaga retreated into the

413
00:22:55.711 --> 00:23:00.000
inner sanctum and committed SuperCrew as did his eldest son Novo Tada later that

414
00:23:00.001 --> 00:23:02.490
same day, his death was a shock to the nation.

415
00:23:02.580 --> 00:23:06.060
I catchy going to enjoy the fruits of his betrayal for a whole 13 days before

416
00:23:06.061 --> 00:23:09.930
Nobunaga's other retainers, 40 minute battle and took their revenge for this.

417
00:23:09.931 --> 00:23:14.310
He became known as the 13 day Shogun and the unification of Japan was

418
00:23:14.430 --> 00:23:18.960
handled by two other men who built upon the violent bloody and ruthless

419
00:23:18.961 --> 00:23:23.310
groundwork set out by ODA Nova Naga. So I really hope you found that video.
