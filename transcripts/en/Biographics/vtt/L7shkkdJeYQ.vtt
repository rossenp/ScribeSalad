7
00:00:25.930 --> 00:00:30.110
You're probably familiar with the musical Avita by Tim rice and Andrew Lloyd

8
00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:30.600
Weber,

9
00:00:30.600 --> 00:00:35.590
which tells the true story of Eva DWA and a relationship with AIAN president,

10
00:00:36.230 --> 00:00:39.310
Juan Perran in the most famous number. Don't cry for me,

11
00:00:39.311 --> 00:00:41.940
Argentina Avita ARA us as the crowds,

12
00:00:41.941 --> 00:00:46.180
after orchestrating an insurrection to free her husband prisoner to a military

13
00:00:46.181 --> 00:00:48.220
hunter, a young Cheva are witnesses,

14
00:00:48.221 --> 00:00:51.500
the events providing some commentary in song form. Of course.

15
00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:56.220
So how much of this famed musical scene is true and how much is just

16
00:00:56.310 --> 00:01:00.740
dramatized dreamers? Well, we'll find out together in today's biographics,

17
00:01:00.741 --> 00:01:05.490
which covers the lives of Avita and Juan Perran to illegitimate children

18
00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:08.370
who rose from obscurity to ultimate power.

19
00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:19.410
Maria, Eva dote later known simply as Eva or Avita was born on may the seventh,

20
00:01:19.810 --> 00:01:24.440
19, 19 in the town of lost tall do in the Argentine pamper or

21
00:01:25.600 --> 00:01:25.820
Farlands.

22
00:01:25.820 --> 00:01:30.560
She was the youngest of five children bought Duana Urgan and Juan Duerte,

23
00:01:31.120 --> 00:01:35.160
Juan Andana were not married. In fact, her father had a second official family.

24
00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:40.160
Bon was a wealthy and successful farm manager with close ties to rich landowners

25
00:01:40.161 --> 00:01:42.160
and the elite members of the conservative party.

26
00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:45.910
<v 1>After Eva's birth, this party started losing ground to the radicals,</v>

27
00:01:45.911 --> 00:01:50.110
which caused a decline in Hans fortunes. Bud is accustomed to relative.

28
00:01:50.111 --> 00:01:52.710
Wealth had to tighten the belt a few years later,

29
00:01:52.890 --> 00:01:55.710
banter punched some extra holes in the belt altogether.

30
00:01:55.780 --> 00:01:59.750
When Han died in a car accident on the 8th of January, 1926,

31
00:02:00.670 --> 00:02:04.380
quarte had never recognized the children he had with qu meaning they would

32
00:02:04.381 --> 00:02:05.460
receive no inheritance.

33
00:02:05.610 --> 00:02:09.540
This humiliation was compounded by the treatment received at Quan's funeral,

34
00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:13.900
his lawful widow and her wealthy family physically prevented Vita into siblings

35
00:02:13.901 --> 00:02:15.100
from attending the service.

36
00:02:15.370 --> 00:02:17.620
<v 0>This was a watershed moment in Vita's upbringing.</v>

37
00:02:17.880 --> 00:02:22.700
The knowledge that she was an explicit part of the lower rungs of Argentinian

38
00:02:22.701 --> 00:02:27.530
society ostracized by the rich elite. By the time Eva started first grade,

39
00:02:27.630 --> 00:02:31.850
her other siblings, Juan junior and Lisa were already working as clerks.

40
00:02:31.851 --> 00:02:36.370
While mom Juan spent hours on her sewing machine as a self-employed seamstres

41
00:02:36.770 --> 00:02:40.210
Eva was not yet burdens with these responsibilities and she would spend her

42
00:02:40.211 --> 00:02:44.240
school free hours, climbing trees and exploring the countryside apps.

43
00:02:44.270 --> 00:02:45.160
Most importantly,

44
00:02:45.300 --> 00:02:49.560
she enjoyed dressing up and improvising plays for her friends and her siblings.

45
00:02:49.700 --> 00:02:52.400
Her co-star was second youngest sister Amin.

46
00:02:52.620 --> 00:02:57.200
And that you could count on Juan Jr. As the stage designer in 1930,

47
00:02:57.300 --> 00:02:59.520
the DS moved to the town of Huen.

48
00:02:59.700 --> 00:03:04.200
It was here that Eva's pension for dress up games evolved into a full blown

49
00:03:04.201 --> 00:03:08.000
passion for acting with a rich data films watched at the village cinema and

50
00:03:08.001 --> 00:03:08.840
radio dramas.

51
00:03:08.980 --> 00:03:12.760
She also joined a school drama group and performed for the first time on stage

52
00:03:12.980 --> 00:03:15.880
by 1934, that the age of 15 Eva made her choice.

53
00:03:16.100 --> 00:03:19.070
She would move to Buenos airs and become a actress.

54
00:03:19.450 --> 00:03:23.470
Her mother Juan was not sold on the idea. How could a girl?

55
00:03:23.610 --> 00:03:27.710
So young face the dangers of the big capital, according to some accounts,

56
00:03:27.711 --> 00:03:32.470
it was celebrity tango singer Augustine magaldi who convinced QA to let Eva

57
00:03:32.471 --> 00:03:34.590
follow her dreams in the rice Webber musical.

58
00:03:34.930 --> 00:03:38.910
The much older magaldi is portrayed as Eva's lover and the,

59
00:03:39.300 --> 00:03:41.460
to elope to Buenos airs a less dramatic,

60
00:03:41.560 --> 00:03:45.620
but more likely version of events comes courtesy of Eva's older sister Amin.

61
00:03:46.220 --> 00:03:49.620
It was the headmaster of Eva school who had noticed the girl's talent and

62
00:03:49.650 --> 00:03:53.500
convinced mum wanted her to let the girl press her fortune with acting.

63
00:03:53.720 --> 00:03:57.860
And before you start gossiping, no Eva did not elope with the headmaster.

64
00:03:58.030 --> 00:04:01.690
There was no Elop here. It was Juan who took Ivie to,

65
00:04:01.770 --> 00:04:04.770
to Burno areas and arranged for her to move in with some family friends.

66
00:04:05.200 --> 00:04:07.410
This was the beginning of her adventure.

67
00:04:13.760 --> 00:04:17.370
Argentina in the 1930s was a nation struggling under the weight of poverty,

68
00:04:17.930 --> 00:04:19.010
unemployment, and hunger.

69
00:04:19.240 --> 00:04:21.720
This was the care in much of the rest of the world as well.

70
00:04:21.721 --> 00:04:23.960
Following the financial collapse of 1929,

71
00:04:24.150 --> 00:04:28.160
tens of thousands of Argentines moved from the farms and the countryside into

72
00:04:28.161 --> 00:04:32.800
Buenos airs, looking for better working and living conditions. Year after year,

73
00:04:32.801 --> 00:04:36.520
the social get widened between the upper and middle classes and the desperately

74
00:04:36.521 --> 00:04:40.480
poor. This was the backdrop for Eva's first steps in professional ag,

75
00:04:41.070 --> 00:04:44.150
as she too struggled to make a living amidst fierce competition,

76
00:04:44.410 --> 00:04:47.270
but she clearly had talent, brains and beauty,

77
00:04:47.320 --> 00:04:49.310
which is always a powerful combination.

78
00:04:49.750 --> 00:04:54.350
Eva was soon hard by the compania Argentina deed professional troop,

79
00:04:54.351 --> 00:04:58.190
and she made her debut in March, 1935 in 1937,

80
00:04:58.390 --> 00:05:00.990
Eva turned 18 and her career went from strength to strength.

81
00:05:01.160 --> 00:05:05.140
She first appeared on the silver screen and then on the radio while her roles on

82
00:05:05.500 --> 00:05:09.020
stage and in cinema mainly were bit parts or supporting characters,

83
00:05:09.240 --> 00:05:14.100
it was on the radio where Eva could get her best parts and really progress her

84
00:05:14.101 --> 00:05:15.180
career. And it was radio,

85
00:05:15.440 --> 00:05:18.700
not cinema that made her a household name in Argentina,

86
00:05:19.020 --> 00:05:22.090
a co star in one of her many radio dramas co to diva,

87
00:05:22.091 --> 00:05:25.050
labeling her as professional, dependable and talented.

88
00:05:25.190 --> 00:05:28.090
But Eva also picked up a reputation as well.

89
00:05:28.390 --> 00:05:30.610
Not exactly the nicest person to be around.

90
00:05:30.910 --> 00:05:34.290
It seems that either was generally not liked by many of her colleagues.

91
00:05:34.510 --> 00:05:37.850
It may have been these same colleagues who latest spread rumors that Eva's

92
00:05:37.851 --> 00:05:41.330
career was accelerated by a propensity to sleep with the right people.

93
00:05:41.710 --> 00:05:45.560
It more likely though that these rumors were circulated after she had become

94
00:05:45.700 --> 00:05:48.200
Mrs. Perran in order to undermine the president,

95
00:05:48.390 --> 00:05:52.200
neither him nor Avita would ever lack enemies, whatever the truth,

96
00:05:52.600 --> 00:05:56.960
Eva doer surely did not lack talent as she was routinely signed up for one radio

97
00:05:57.090 --> 00:05:59.440
drama. After the other in 1943,

98
00:05:59.620 --> 00:06:03.680
Eva reached the peak of a popularity as the star of, and I'm not joking here.

99
00:06:04.120 --> 00:06:07.480
A biography show. Yep. That's why I do what I do. Step number one,

100
00:06:07.510 --> 00:06:12.000
host a biography show. Step number two, running a country. Step number three,

101
00:06:12.230 --> 00:06:14.280
musical name after me. Perfect.

102
00:06:14.620 --> 00:06:19.550
Joking aside Eva's show was a collection of dramatizations in which she played

103
00:06:19.551 --> 00:06:23.310
the role of women who had made history like Elizabeth. I first, Catherine,

104
00:06:23.410 --> 00:06:26.870
the great is Adora Duncan and Sarah Burnhart among others.

105
00:06:27.230 --> 00:06:30.790
I wonder if she could imagine that one day her own life story could have been

106
00:06:30.791 --> 00:06:35.670
dramatized in such a show. 1943 was a year of importance, not just Eva,

107
00:06:35.890 --> 00:06:39.660
but all large on June the fourth military coup led by general,

108
00:06:39.710 --> 00:06:44.220
Pedro Ramirez seized power from the president Ramon Castillo within the grief of

109
00:06:44.221 --> 00:06:44.821
conspirators.

110
00:06:44.821 --> 00:06:48.420
There was an ambitious Colonel who was put in charge of the ministry of labor

111
00:06:48.440 --> 00:06:51.860
and welfare. His name was Colonel Juan Perran,

112
00:06:58.930 --> 00:07:01.250
Juan Domingo Perran was born in Los Lobo,

113
00:07:01.410 --> 00:07:05.170
a province of Buen areas on October the eighth, 1895,

114
00:07:05.360 --> 00:07:09.210
like either Juan was born out of wedlock, the child of wealthy farmer,

115
00:07:09.300 --> 00:07:12.250
Mario Tama Perran and Han SOA.

116
00:07:12.610 --> 00:07:16.610
Juan spent most of his childhood in early teenage years in the pamper in the

117
00:07:16.611 --> 00:07:20.240
south of the country. It, his wish to returns the capital to study medicine.

118
00:07:20.380 --> 00:07:23.840
But when he did return to Buenos areas, it was to enter the military academy.

119
00:07:24.020 --> 00:07:27.240
In 1911, he graduated in 1913,

120
00:07:27.920 --> 00:07:31.080
barely 18 with the rank of second lefthand in the infantry.

121
00:07:31.520 --> 00:07:34.960
Bon was amongst the first of his class and he gained a reputation as a

122
00:07:34.961 --> 00:07:37.960
hardworking students. He also excelled in physical training,

123
00:07:38.320 --> 00:07:40.550
standing at six foot tall and being solidly built.

124
00:07:40.850 --> 00:07:45.430
The young athletic Juan became an army champion in boxing, skiing and fencing.

125
00:07:45.570 --> 00:07:49.550
He even almost made it onto the Argentine Olympic fencing team as Argentina

126
00:07:49.600 --> 00:07:53.790
never entered a war during his early military career pong only knew about peace

127
00:07:54.070 --> 00:07:54.730
time deployment.

128
00:07:54.730 --> 00:07:57.270
He progressed through the ranks thanks to his academic endeavors,

129
00:07:57.290 --> 00:08:02.180
as well as the publication of several on military morals and hygiene in 1925.

130
00:08:02.500 --> 00:08:06.140
Juan mess with 17 year old are really AAR. After a four year engagement,

131
00:08:06.240 --> 00:08:08.980
the two married on January the fifth, 1929,

132
00:08:09.300 --> 00:08:12.540
a was a teacher intelligence and academically minded,

133
00:08:12.780 --> 00:08:14.180
a valuable companion for Parran,

134
00:08:14.300 --> 00:08:18.380
a really dedicated much of a time to translating military theory textbooks from

135
00:08:18.381 --> 00:08:20.690
English for a husband in 1939.

136
00:08:20.750 --> 00:08:23.730
The now captain barong was a member of the army staff,

137
00:08:23.750 --> 00:08:27.290
as well as a professor of military history at the higher Institute for war

138
00:08:27.291 --> 00:08:27.870
studies,

139
00:08:27.870 --> 00:08:32.010
he continued publishing textbooks and expanded his field of knowledge into

140
00:08:32.011 --> 00:08:36.250
linguistics with the book on the language of the indigenous people from in and

141
00:08:36.251 --> 00:08:38.410
arounds Patagonia in 1936,

142
00:08:38.810 --> 00:08:42.680
Barran had become a major and was tasked with a delicate assignment. Officially.

143
00:08:42.740 --> 00:08:47.600
He was detached as a military attacher into the Argentian embassy in Chile.

144
00:08:47.760 --> 00:08:48.593
Unofficially.

145
00:08:49.000 --> 00:08:53.680
Juan was actually spying on the Chilean army in search of potential plans for an

146
00:08:53.840 --> 00:08:57.840
invasion of Argentina, which was an event feared to be likely at that time,

147
00:08:58.600 --> 00:09:02.800
Parran was a skilled agent reporting on Chili's military capabilities without

148
00:09:02.801 --> 00:09:03.840
ever blowing his cover.

149
00:09:04.230 --> 00:09:08.480
This success may have earned him his next promotion to left 10 Colonel at the

150
00:09:08.481 --> 00:09:11.520
end of the same year on September the 10th, 1938,

151
00:09:11.521 --> 00:09:15.830
after a prolonged period of illness, a earlier died young at the age of 30,

152
00:09:16.010 --> 00:09:20.550
the diagnosis was cervical cancer. This was a devastating blow to the officer,

153
00:09:21.030 --> 00:09:25.070
a valued asset to Argentina's military Perran state of depression worried his

154
00:09:25.270 --> 00:09:28.750
superiors to the point that they offered him another post abroad to get his mind

155
00:09:28.751 --> 00:09:33.270
off the tragedy from 1939 to the beginning of 1940 Peron was attached to the

156
00:09:33.290 --> 00:09:37.500
Army's European mission of foreign studies. This involved him touring Italy,

157
00:09:37.590 --> 00:09:39.060
Spain, Germany, Hungary,

158
00:09:39.160 --> 00:09:42.540
and France to study and observe those countries militaries.

159
00:09:42.680 --> 00:09:46.900
He spent most of his time in Italy here. Perran focused on mounds in warfare,

160
00:09:47.160 --> 00:09:51.260
but he also had the chance to study closely the policies and authoritarian

161
00:09:51.410 --> 00:09:56.330
methods of Benito Moline while never fully adhering to FAS ideology.

162
00:09:56.810 --> 00:10:01.770
Baron came to appreciate the dictatorial methods in use in Italy and in other

163
00:10:01.970 --> 00:10:05.850
European countries, he started to appreciate the notion of strong,

164
00:10:06.530 --> 00:10:11.410
direct authoritarian rule as the only means to impose effective reforms in his

165
00:10:11.411 --> 00:10:15.290
home country. Koran returned to Argentina in 1941,

166
00:10:15.291 --> 00:10:19.520
having risen to rank of Colonel the country at that time was ruled by president

167
00:10:20.120 --> 00:10:23.720
Haron Castillo whose term had become unpopular due to widespread corruption,

168
00:10:23.850 --> 00:10:25.560
fraud, economic stagnation,

169
00:10:25.620 --> 00:10:28.200
and an increasing divide between the upper and lower classes.

170
00:10:28.510 --> 00:10:31.400
This is when Perran started getting involved in politics.

171
00:10:31.500 --> 00:10:35.920
He joined a secret outfit called G O U Grupo OFS UN

172
00:10:36.760 --> 00:10:37.990
group of United offices,

173
00:10:38.320 --> 00:10:41.830
which had a nationalist agenda in July, 1943.

174
00:10:41.850 --> 00:10:46.230
The Gou seized power in an almost bloodless coup general Arturo

175
00:10:46.450 --> 00:10:50.150
Rosson took power in roughly the amount of time needed to choose the color

176
00:10:50.151 --> 00:10:51.190
scheme for his office.

177
00:10:51.310 --> 00:10:55.750
Curtains Rosson was favorable to the allied cause in world war II and was open

178
00:10:55.810 --> 00:10:59.060
to civilians in his cabinets. But as fellow conspirators,

179
00:10:59.061 --> 00:11:01.020
they disagreed with both ideas.

180
00:11:01.660 --> 00:11:06.140
Rosson was promptly replaced with general Pedro Ramirez whose agenda and methods

181
00:11:06.141 --> 00:11:09.260
were much more closely aligned to the access powers,

182
00:11:09.440 --> 00:11:14.260
firmly anti leftist and totalitarian Ramirez appointed general Farrell as

183
00:11:14.540 --> 00:11:18.170
minister of war who brought along Parran as his personal secretary.

184
00:11:18.240 --> 00:11:21.970
This was not enough for the ambitious Colonel who volunteered for a post that

185
00:11:21.971 --> 00:11:25.090
nobody wanted the minister of the national labor department.

186
00:11:25.270 --> 00:11:27.530
It wasn't just a move to get a seat in the cabinet,

187
00:11:27.870 --> 00:11:31.250
but a calculated first step in a long term plan.

188
00:11:31.630 --> 00:11:33.850
So now just before I continue with today's video,

189
00:11:34.050 --> 00:11:36.570

link below and let's carry on with today's video

216
00:13:08.490 --> 00:13:09.010
Minister,

217
00:13:09.010 --> 00:13:11.930
Peron delivered an astounding amount of reform in the span of two years,

218
00:13:12.070 --> 00:13:15.480
all of which gained in the support of the, the masses of industrial workers.

219
00:13:15.900 --> 00:13:18.640
For example, he introduced paid holidays for all workers.

220
00:13:18.820 --> 00:13:22.480
He also limited work hours and mandated, better working conditions.

221
00:13:23.080 --> 00:13:27.080
Perran also established a system of government affiliated trade unions to defend

222
00:13:27.081 --> 00:13:30.960
workers rights and always intervened on their side against industry owners.

223
00:13:31.260 --> 00:13:35.110
He did not refrain from using government funds to pay for workers, salaries,

224
00:13:35.250 --> 00:13:38.430
or pensions. When factory owners threatened to suspend payments.

225
00:13:38.440 --> 00:13:42.310
These progressive policies certainly benefited the lower classes which made

226
00:13:42.670 --> 00:13:45.710
Perran increasingly popular. This was his strategy bolster,

227
00:13:45.711 --> 00:13:48.190
the status of workers, the majority of the population,

228
00:13:48.200 --> 00:13:51.670
which would grant him support and even devotion in return.

229
00:13:52.150 --> 00:13:55.860
Perran referred to as supporters as the desk cam SADS or shirtless,

230
00:13:56.120 --> 00:13:59.580
no Argentinian was under the illusion that Perran operated within a democracy.

231
00:13:59.970 --> 00:14:02.700
This was a military authoritarian government,

232
00:14:03.060 --> 00:14:07.460
but unlike previous democratic cabinets Perran delivered on January the 15th,

233
00:14:07.780 --> 00:14:10.780
1944, a national emergency put Perran to the test,

234
00:14:11.000 --> 00:14:15.060
an earthquake completely obliterate the province of San Juan killing 7,000

235
00:14:15.061 --> 00:14:20.010
inhabit and injuring another 12,000 pro organized nationwide campaign to

236
00:14:20.011 --> 00:14:23.490
raise funds to aid the wounded and the displaced for this effort.

237
00:14:23.550 --> 00:14:25.850
He drafted national celebrities to a system,

238
00:14:25.920 --> 00:14:30.730
including popular actors from the stage cinema and radio. Some days later,

239
00:14:31.110 --> 00:14:33.450
Eva set up a meeting with Juan in his office,

240
00:14:33.470 --> 00:14:37.240
during which he asked for more opportunities to raise funds for the earthquake

241
00:14:37.241 --> 00:14:37.900
victims.

242
00:14:37.900 --> 00:14:41.280
It was then that Perran felt an immediate attraction for the young actress.

243
00:14:41.580 --> 00:14:45.720
He later recalls. As I looked at her, I felt that her words were taking over me.

244
00:14:45.880 --> 00:14:49.640
I was almost subjugated by the warmth in her voice and in her eyes.

245
00:14:50.060 --> 00:14:52.720
And just like that, an expert of Kuda Tetra,

246
00:14:53.000 --> 00:14:57.920
a veteran of a Kuta were brought together by a Kuda Fu if you'll pardon my

247
00:14:57.921 --> 00:15:02.040
French, the two initially kept their relationship a secret. Why? Well,

248
00:15:02.041 --> 00:15:06.320
the age difference might have played a part is he was 49 and she was 25.

249
00:15:06.660 --> 00:15:10.040
But well, it was also their business besides their romantic lives.

250
00:15:10.360 --> 00:15:13.350
Their careers went from strength to strength in early 1944.

251
00:15:13.380 --> 00:15:17.990
Peron's patron general Farrell became president and he appointed his protege as

252
00:15:17.991 --> 00:15:20.910
vice president and minister of war. On top of his labor duties.

253
00:15:21.550 --> 00:15:25.310
Eva was no less overworked hosting. Three daily radio shows one on biographies,

254
00:15:25.370 --> 00:15:29.590
one on geography and one on top 10 items. Okay. Not really.

255
00:15:29.950 --> 00:15:33.380
It was actually two radio drama am and a propaganda broadcast in support of the

256
00:15:33.381 --> 00:15:35.380
regime on July the ninth, 1944,

257
00:15:35.381 --> 00:15:38.020
the two lovebirds decided to go public with their relationship.

258
00:15:38.040 --> 00:15:39.700
By showing up together at a gala event,

259
00:15:40.220 --> 00:15:43.260
Peron had become the most popular member of the regime and joined great

260
00:15:43.261 --> 00:15:47.780
visibility with the press and well, so did Vita appearing by his side in public

261
00:15:54.270 --> 00:15:55.650
In March of 1945,

262
00:15:55.651 --> 00:16:00.210
president Farrell opportunistically declared war on the access powers securing a

263
00:16:00.211 --> 00:16:02.770
place in the United nations for Argentina in August.

264
00:16:02.950 --> 00:16:06.410
He decided to soften his regime even promising free elections.

265
00:16:06.411 --> 00:16:07.890
By the end of the year, in the meantime,

266
00:16:08.290 --> 00:16:10.690
Parran had fallen outta favor with the political establishment.

267
00:16:10.870 --> 00:16:14.840
His populist reform had alienated the support of the more traditional elements

268
00:16:14.841 --> 00:16:15.680
of the ruling classes.

269
00:16:16.020 --> 00:16:20.600
The military in the church Avita had also come under attack accused of being

270
00:16:20.750 --> 00:16:24.320
only a power hungry social climber, a little more than a prostitute.

271
00:16:24.580 --> 00:16:29.280
The power couples downward descend was prologue ton's appointment of Avitas

272
00:16:29.281 --> 00:16:32.000
friend as head of the department of posts and Telegraph.

273
00:16:32.480 --> 00:16:36.630
Her Ron was forced to resign on October the 10th, 1945, by the 13th.

274
00:16:36.650 --> 00:16:40.190
He was arrested on the island of Martin GU Garcia years later,

275
00:16:40.710 --> 00:16:44.630
Patran recalls how Avita immediately organized a general labor strike followed

276
00:16:44.631 --> 00:16:47.110
by a massive demonstration of the Des cam Sardos.

277
00:16:47.170 --> 00:16:50.710
She marched at the head of hundreds of thousands of workers occupying Plaza de

278
00:16:50.910 --> 00:16:52.030
Mayo in BU airways,

279
00:16:52.050 --> 00:16:56.180
the square in front of the seat of the government Avita then addressed the

280
00:16:56.181 --> 00:16:59.100
crowds from a balcony Aang Gava was among them.

281
00:16:59.130 --> 00:17:03.940
This was remembered as the foundation day of Peton emo or not.

282
00:17:05.100 --> 00:17:09.060
Koran is the only source to ever circulate this version of the events,

283
00:17:09.061 --> 00:17:13.140
which was later incorporated into the musical. In reality, Avita,

284
00:17:13.141 --> 00:17:15.490
like did not play a role in the uprising at all.

285
00:17:15.590 --> 00:17:20.050
The strike was spontaneous as were the mass demonstrations, the desk cam ADOS.

286
00:17:20.051 --> 00:17:21.770
They rallied in PLA Mayer,

287
00:17:21.771 --> 00:17:25.410
demanding Forand to be released the authorities hoping to prevent bloodshed.

288
00:17:25.560 --> 00:17:28.770
They complied with their demands asking Parran to step onto the balcony,

289
00:17:28.950 --> 00:17:31.850
to calm down the mob and how agave. Well,

290
00:17:31.910 --> 00:17:36.080
he was 17 at the time and he was still at 10 ending secondary school and did not

291
00:17:36.081 --> 00:17:39.720
move to bueno airs until 1947. He never met Avita.

292
00:17:39.721 --> 00:17:43.800
Their only recorded contact is a letter he wrote to her asking if she could buy

293
00:17:43.801 --> 00:17:47.240
him a Jeep &lt;laugh&gt;. As soon as Perran was released from prison,

294
00:17:47.420 --> 00:17:49.720
he did two things. He resigned from the military,

295
00:17:49.750 --> 00:17:51.040
leaving with the rank of general,

296
00:17:51.300 --> 00:17:54.920
and he married Avita in a registry office on the 22nd of October,

297
00:17:55.000 --> 00:17:59.360
followed by a religious ceremony on the 10th of December with Avita by signed

298
00:17:59.760 --> 00:18:03.080
Peron set off to organize his candidature in the new general actions.

299
00:18:03.420 --> 00:18:08.200
He ran as a candidate from the Partido laborist or labor party. His opposition,

300
00:18:08.201 --> 00:18:12.710
the democratic union was a disparate coalition that included both conservatives

301
00:18:12.711 --> 00:18:15.830
and communists with the open backing of us ambassador Braden,

302
00:18:15.970 --> 00:18:20.950
his influence was so extensive that the electoral choice was often presented as

303
00:18:21.470 --> 00:18:22.510
Perran versus Braden.

304
00:18:22.990 --> 00:18:26.990
Juan Avita organized an intense campaign trail with a chartered train called

305
00:18:27.830 --> 00:18:28.870
ESCA asado. This was,

306
00:18:29.180 --> 00:18:33.020
is the first time in the history of Argentina that a presidential Canor was

307
00:18:33.021 --> 00:18:36.260
accompanied by his wife on February the eighth, 1946.

308
00:18:36.320 --> 00:18:39.140
She pioneered another first at a party rally.

309
00:18:39.400 --> 00:18:43.260
She replaced Juan on the speaker's podium as he was too ill to speak,

310
00:18:43.261 --> 00:18:44.094
unfortunately,

311
00:18:44.620 --> 00:18:47.900
and that was a total disaster while workers loved her on thanks to his earlier

312
00:18:48.130 --> 00:18:50.450
reforms, they were still trustful of his wife.

313
00:18:50.710 --> 00:18:55.090
The crowds would not let her speak drowning her out with cries of we want her

314
00:18:55.250 --> 00:18:58.690
on, but little by little if ISA grew in popularity,

315
00:18:58.790 --> 00:19:03.210
her acting talent trained voice and overall good looks helped in no small

316
00:19:03.211 --> 00:19:05.450
measure on June the fourth, 1946,

317
00:19:05.451 --> 00:19:09.010
the couple found their victory on her on had been democratically elected.

318
00:19:09.270 --> 00:19:14.080
The new president of Argentina and Devita had become the first lady at 27 years

319
00:19:14.081 --> 00:19:14.914
of age.

320
00:19:20.950 --> 00:19:23.920
Juan Peron's presidency is not easily defines if not,

321
00:19:23.980 --> 00:19:25.960
as a Labrinth of contradictions,

322
00:19:26.210 --> 00:19:30.080
let's begin with his ideology known as hu or justice.

323
00:19:30.810 --> 00:19:35.310
It was founded on social justice and heavy state intervention in the form of

324
00:19:35.311 --> 00:19:39.790
welfare programs to support the lower classes. But it was also known as Patmore,

325
00:19:40.030 --> 00:19:43.910
an indication that this movement was a unique way of running a country centered

326
00:19:43.911 --> 00:19:47.590
around the cult of Juan Peron's personality and strong leadership.

327
00:19:47.700 --> 00:19:50.990
Juan Peron introduced several progressive reforms mainly to the,

328
00:19:51.080 --> 00:19:54.580
the benefits of his electoral base, the working classes.

329
00:19:54.920 --> 00:19:58.700
He made social security, education and healthcare totally free and universal.

330
00:19:58.720 --> 00:20:02.300
He introduced maternity leave and the right to vote for women with I Vita's key

331
00:20:02.580 --> 00:20:03.413
contribution.

332
00:20:03.540 --> 00:20:07.300
Peron also boosted the Argentine economy by developing hydroelectric power

333
00:20:07.301 --> 00:20:11.890
plants, launching a local iron and steel industry and expanding ship building by

334
00:20:11.891 --> 00:20:16.210
500%. But to achieve all this, he implemented rash authoritarian measures,

335
00:20:16.211 --> 00:20:19.890
including censorship of the press and incarceration of dissenters.

336
00:20:20.110 --> 00:20:24.530
In terms of foreign policy bronze strategy for Argentina was to become a neutral

337
00:20:24.531 --> 00:20:29.170
country along a position aligned with neither capitalism nor communism during

338
00:20:29.171 --> 00:20:34.160
the cold war in practice did not hide his ility towards American and British

339
00:20:34.560 --> 00:20:36.280
presence or influence over Argentina.

340
00:20:36.500 --> 00:20:40.680
Was he secretly considering a drift towards Moscow though? Well, not exactly.

341
00:20:40.890 --> 00:20:45.400
After becoming president Ronan made Argentina a well-know Haven for former

342
00:20:45.690 --> 00:20:50.560
Nazis, a Iman Joseph man, Eric PKA OTO, and many,

343
00:20:50.670 --> 00:20:52.240
many, many other war criminals,

344
00:20:52.241 --> 00:20:56.640
all found refuge there SC even became a bodyguard to the parents and may well

345
00:20:56.641 --> 00:20:58.280
have had a liaison with Avita,

346
00:20:58.480 --> 00:21:03.000
a rumor that was never confirmed all of these Nazi officials except for SC had

347
00:21:03.001 --> 00:21:07.670
been sentenced in absentia at the Nurenberg trials and wanted for crimes against

348
00:21:07.910 --> 00:21:11.550
humanity. Pong was doing more than just accepting them into his country here.

349
00:21:11.730 --> 00:21:15.630
He actively invited them offering money, houses and jobs.

350
00:21:16.010 --> 00:21:17.430
So what was his plan?

351
00:21:18.150 --> 00:21:21.190
Perran had estimated that a new world war would break out by 1949,

352
00:21:21.630 --> 00:21:24.150
fought to by the block SL by the us and the Soviet union.

353
00:21:24.410 --> 00:21:28.100
His end strategy was to bargain for Argentina per anticipation on the Western

354
00:21:28.330 --> 00:21:32.100
side. And that's when the expertise of ex Nazis would've come in handy.

355
00:21:32.370 --> 00:21:35.500
They were trained officers adept at fighting the Soviets

356
00:21:41.640 --> 00:21:44.900
In June, 1947. Avita had a first official trip abroad,

357
00:21:44.960 --> 00:21:47.810
the rainbow tour across Europe and south in Erica.

358
00:21:48.230 --> 00:21:52.330
Her first leg of the tour was in Spain where she met generally SIM Francisco

359
00:21:52.470 --> 00:21:56.450
Franco considered to be one of the last vestiges of fascism in Europe.

360
00:21:56.640 --> 00:22:01.050
This did not help the image of the Parran in subsequent visits to Italy and

361
00:22:01.051 --> 00:22:05.130
Switzerland Avita was accused of being the representative of a fascist country

362
00:22:05.430 --> 00:22:09.040
and was booed or even peed with egg and rotten fruit.

363
00:22:09.220 --> 00:22:10.640
During her official visit to London,

364
00:22:10.940 --> 00:22:13.480
she was snubbed by the king upon returning from Europe,

365
00:22:14.000 --> 00:22:16.600
Avita dedicated herself to the cause of women's suffrage.

366
00:22:16.740 --> 00:22:19.800
She had already supported a bill to that effect in 1946,

367
00:22:19.980 --> 00:22:23.320
and she now wanted things to change. And for them to change fast,

368
00:22:24.200 --> 00:22:28.360
Avita launched an appeal to Artinian women who staged two massive rallies,

369
00:22:28.870 --> 00:22:33.430
September of 1947 and plastered Buenos areas with posters on September the

370
00:22:33.431 --> 00:22:38.030
23rd parliament ratified the bill suffrage was truly universal in Argentina.

371
00:22:38.630 --> 00:22:42.110
If IA counted the achievement two years later by founding the first or female

372
00:22:42.160 --> 00:22:45.390
party in Argentina to ensure that women would be on the ballot,

373
00:22:45.930 --> 00:22:46.910
not just at the ballot,

374
00:22:47.430 --> 00:22:51.380
if IITA understood her feminist victory would not have been possible without the

375
00:22:51.381 --> 00:22:54.460
backing and active participation of her husband in her rising.

376
00:22:54.560 --> 00:22:56.740
She made it clear that in order to bring about progress,

377
00:22:57.010 --> 00:22:59.500
both male and female actions were necessary.

378
00:22:59.680 --> 00:23:03.460
She summarized this is a man of action triumph over everyone else,

379
00:23:03.820 --> 00:23:07.740
a woman of action triumph for everyone else. In other words,

380
00:23:07.810 --> 00:23:11.850
male action was needed to overcome a position when imposing new ideas,

381
00:23:11.910 --> 00:23:14.610
but female action was a constructive energy.

382
00:23:14.870 --> 00:23:19.530
The one to really bring those new ideas to the benefits of others inspired by

383
00:23:19.531 --> 00:23:24.250
these ideals. Avita threw herself into welfare work. And by 1947,

384
00:23:24.350 --> 00:23:28.250
she had become a sort of unofficial minister of labor committing to a grueling

385
00:23:28.251 --> 00:23:32.680
work schedule of up to 22 hours day meeting trade union delegations and

386
00:23:32.681 --> 00:23:34.040
addressing welfare issues.

387
00:23:34.240 --> 00:23:38.160
Examples of her work included organizing state funded holiday camps for workers,

388
00:23:38.520 --> 00:23:40.640
children, building hospitals for textile,

389
00:23:40.840 --> 00:23:44.440
industry employees and distributing age to the poorest families in the country.

390
00:23:45.080 --> 00:23:47.440
And because she had two hours left each day,

391
00:23:48.080 --> 00:23:50.800
Avita put that time to good use to complement her aid efforts.

392
00:23:50.820 --> 00:23:55.080
She created the foundation, Eva Perran focused on helping women, children,

393
00:23:55.340 --> 00:23:56.173
and the elderly.

394
00:23:56.260 --> 00:24:00.000
She collected funds mainly as donations from trade unions and channeled them

395
00:24:00.001 --> 00:24:03.640
into several initiatives, such as the construction of schools and hospitals.

396
00:24:03.820 --> 00:24:08.270
The found continued to finance and develop major works in the field of education

397
00:24:08.271 --> 00:24:11.790
and healthcare. During the early 1950s with Avita supervising,

398
00:24:11.791 --> 00:24:15.190
most of them at this stage, even Parran supporters could not help,

399
00:24:15.191 --> 00:24:18.710
but wonder where the required funds came from officially.

400
00:24:18.711 --> 00:24:21.350
They came from voluntary donations by trade unions,

401
00:24:21.590 --> 00:24:23.030
as well as private enterprises.

402
00:24:23.200 --> 00:24:27.300
There was strong suspicion that donations were enforced by threats,

403
00:24:27.301 --> 00:24:31.020
either donate or face the consequences. Take, for example,

404
00:24:31.200 --> 00:24:32.940
the candy factory called Mumu.

405
00:24:33.000 --> 00:24:36.820
The company was forcibly shut down by the government with all of its employees,

406
00:24:36.821 --> 00:24:38.340
losing their job. Allegedly.

407
00:24:38.341 --> 00:24:42.660
It was because of poor hygienic conditions inside the factory that if it's

408
00:24:42.661 --> 00:24:46.490
direct involvement in a subsequent meeting between factory management and trade

409
00:24:46.550 --> 00:24:51.410
unions led to suspicions that muu was being punished for failing to donate to

410
00:24:51.411 --> 00:24:52.244
the foundation

411
00:24:58.390 --> 00:25:03.090
In 1949, Koran succeeded in having a new constitution ratified by parliament,

412
00:25:03.280 --> 00:25:04.770
this new tax involved,

413
00:25:04.970 --> 00:25:09.520
a new rounds of reform such as universal suffrage and even a declaration of the

414
00:25:09.521 --> 00:25:12.600
rights of the elderly drafted by Avitas foundation.

415
00:25:12.780 --> 00:25:16.920
But the main name of the constitution was to allow for Juan to run for a second

416
00:25:16.950 --> 00:25:18.560
term in future elections,

417
00:25:18.900 --> 00:25:23.440
as was often the case ATO would play a key role by his side this time though,

418
00:25:23.441 --> 00:25:27.950
it would be a more explicit institutionalized one because in August of 1951,

419
00:25:27.951 --> 00:25:31.910
the trade unions formally asked Juan bronze to run again for presidents this

420
00:25:31.911 --> 00:25:36.550
time with Avita as his vice president, despite popular enthusiasm for the IDF,

421
00:25:36.990 --> 00:25:37.950
IITA eventually declined.

422
00:25:38.020 --> 00:25:41.990
This may have been due to pressure from military leadership who always disliked

423
00:25:41.991 --> 00:25:45.230
the first lady. And other reason may have been, I Vita's own poor health.

424
00:25:45.410 --> 00:25:49.340
She had been suffering from fatigue, frequent painting, and vaginal bleeding.

425
00:25:49.550 --> 00:25:49.901
Today.

426
00:25:49.901 --> 00:25:53.820
We know that all these symptoms pointed to a diagnosis of cervical cancer,

427
00:25:54.120 --> 00:25:56.660
the same illness that had killed Peron's first wife,

428
00:25:56.880 --> 00:26:01.300
but the president had decided to hide the truth from Iveta for reasons that are

429
00:26:01.301 --> 00:26:01.861
still unclear.

430
00:26:01.861 --> 00:26:05.860
Perhaps he was to shield her from a devastating diagnosis or perhaps he just

431
00:26:05.861 --> 00:26:09.530
wanted to hide the truth from the public in a cynical electoral move.

432
00:26:10.130 --> 00:26:12.090
Peron did not want to reveal that Avita,

433
00:26:12.091 --> 00:26:16.650
perhaps the biggest source of his presidential popularity may not even be alive

434
00:26:16.710 --> 00:26:18.090
during his second term in office.

435
00:26:18.730 --> 00:26:23.650
Juan Burran won the elections in November of 1951 with a 62% majority Avita

436
00:26:23.890 --> 00:26:27.730
appeared by his side, as he was sworn in. It was one of her last public

437
00:26:35.200 --> 00:26:37.120
Avita. Last month on earth were painful.

438
00:26:37.340 --> 00:26:39.960
The official version of her death on July the 26th,

439
00:26:40.240 --> 00:26:43.680
1952 is that this was caused by late stage cervical cancer.

440
00:26:44.060 --> 00:26:47.720
It may not be a coincidence that Peron's first wife or really had suffered the

441
00:26:47.721 --> 00:26:52.440
same fate. One of the causes of cervical cancer is infection by HPV,

442
00:26:52.740 --> 00:26:54.560
the human papilloma virus.

443
00:26:54.860 --> 00:26:59.080
It is likely that Juan Perran was a carrier of such a virus and thus had

444
00:26:59.400 --> 00:27:01.920
infected both of his wives in 2015.

445
00:27:02.120 --> 00:27:06.750
A new explanation for Avitas demise was put forward by Dr. Daniel Hansen

446
00:27:07.230 --> 00:27:09.990
neurosurgeon at Yale university medical school.

447
00:27:10.400 --> 00:27:13.390
Nisen had obtained scans of Avita skull after a death,

448
00:27:13.391 --> 00:27:16.910
which showed signs of being drilled into this was evidence that the first lady

449
00:27:17.050 --> 00:27:18.390
had received a lobotomy,

450
00:27:18.590 --> 00:27:22.510
an operation that involves cutting the neuro connections between the prefrontal

451
00:27:22.600 --> 00:27:26.380
lobes, the rest of the brain in order to numb emotional responses.

452
00:27:26.560 --> 00:27:30.860
One possibility is that the lobotomy had been a radical measure to manage the

453
00:27:30.861 --> 00:27:31.694
pain of her cancer,

454
00:27:31.880 --> 00:27:35.460
but a more sinister one is that Juan had ordered the lobotomy to curb.

455
00:27:35.980 --> 00:27:37.860
IVIS increasingly unpredictable behavior.

456
00:27:38.120 --> 00:27:42.740
As she succumbed to cancer Avi's actions were becoming more and more extreme in

457
00:27:42.860 --> 00:27:46.290
her last months of life Avita called for violent action against her enemies and

458
00:27:46.470 --> 00:27:50.530
the enemies of the people which she identified as the oligarchs in traditional

459
00:27:50.560 --> 00:27:51.690
Argentinian society.

460
00:27:51.910 --> 00:27:55.930
It appeared that she even ordered from her sick Betty consignment of 5,000

461
00:27:55.931 --> 00:28:00.210
automatic pistols in 1,500 machine guns to arm the trade unions.

462
00:28:00.510 --> 00:28:04.400
She was seriously risking the onset of a civil war. The news.

463
00:28:04.500 --> 00:28:08.440
It would've been enough to tear apart the factions of Juan Barrans allies who

464
00:28:08.441 --> 00:28:11.880
already objected to a Vita's power and popularity. The country.

465
00:28:12.380 --> 00:28:15.760
It really could have descended into conflict. According to Dr. Nisen,

466
00:28:15.860 --> 00:28:18.600
the lobotomy was performed by an American surgeon,

467
00:28:18.690 --> 00:28:23.360
James poppin within the presidential palace Poppin's nurse reported that poppin

468
00:28:23.640 --> 00:28:27.590
had practiced the non convicts that were taken from wearies prisons.

469
00:28:27.740 --> 00:28:32.270
Medically the intervention was at least a partial success as IITA did not die

470
00:28:32.300 --> 00:28:35.590
immediately. It also succeeded in silencing her for good.

471
00:28:35.690 --> 00:28:39.670
The lobotomy put her in a catatonic state and she stops eating her health

472
00:28:39.671 --> 00:28:43.710
deteriorated quickly until her death in July at the age of 33,

473
00:28:43.710 --> 00:28:47.820
8 months after Perran had been and reelected the masses mobilized one last time

474
00:28:47.821 --> 00:28:52.020
for a funeral with thousands of citizens following the procession Avi's body was

475
00:28:52.021 --> 00:28:55.860
placed at the headquarters of the general labor Confederation while a publicly

476
00:28:55.861 --> 00:28:57.580
funded Mo Liam was being built.

477
00:28:58.020 --> 00:29:00.620
Juan Peron ordered that her body be perfectly embalmed.

478
00:29:00.760 --> 00:29:04.300
Her body thus became a sort of Relic to be adored by the masses,

479
00:29:04.490 --> 00:29:05.850
sort of a fitting in end,

480
00:29:06.130 --> 00:29:10.130
considering that the Pope immediately started receiving requests for Avita to

481
00:29:10.131 --> 00:29:10.964
become a Saint

482
00:29:17.070 --> 00:29:21.650
By late 1952 Horan realized that he could not continue his policies of public

483
00:29:21.651 --> 00:29:22.484
spending forever.

484
00:29:22.630 --> 00:29:26.600
The country's finances were sluggish and the economy was stag dating or over the

485
00:29:26.601 --> 00:29:31.400
death of Aveta had Delta heart blow to his popularity exacerbated by rumors that

486
00:29:31.460 --> 00:29:35.440
he had started dating a 14 year old girl Catholic authorities in the military.

487
00:29:35.750 --> 00:29:36.640
They were not happy.

488
00:29:37.320 --> 00:29:40.320
Braun changed his foreign policy in an effort to revive the economy.

489
00:29:40.321 --> 00:29:41.960
Traditionally anti-American.

490
00:29:42.020 --> 00:29:45.000
He made a U-turn and looked for reproachment with Washington,

491
00:29:45.400 --> 00:29:48.960
a move that should have revived Argentina's exports to the us,

492
00:29:49.220 --> 00:29:53.240
but it was only a matter of time before a new conspiracy ended his tenure in

493
00:29:53.241 --> 00:29:56.520
office. This happens on September the 16th, 1955,

494
00:29:56.880 --> 00:30:01.550
a co led by the more traditionalist echelons of the Navy in the air force took

495
00:30:01.560 --> 00:30:03.230
power. After shelling Plaza,

496
00:30:03.710 --> 00:30:08.510
my causing 400 casualties PR was forced into Axel by the new military hunter.

497
00:30:08.730 --> 00:30:12.030
He first moved to Paraguay and five years later landed in Madrid.

498
00:30:12.170 --> 00:30:15.910
By the time he was in Spain had taken a third wife, Maria Ella Martinez,

499
00:30:16.090 --> 00:30:19.630
who was an AIAN dancer that an known as Isabelle in the meantime,

500
00:30:19.631 --> 00:30:22.180
the hun had forbid an all as acts of Peron's policies,

501
00:30:22.310 --> 00:30:25.980
displaying images of Juan Perran and David Vita was also forbidden.

502
00:30:26.050 --> 00:30:30.740
This ban extended to a Vita's body in 1955, it was removed from its Mo Liam.

503
00:30:30.840 --> 00:30:33.700
No one could account for her body for the ensuing 16 years,

504
00:30:33.970 --> 00:30:37.700
some cynical soul once said that the ex you can't compete with is the dead one.

505
00:30:38.220 --> 00:30:40.100
Isabelle Martinez certainly must have felt that way,

506
00:30:40.380 --> 00:30:42.690
that Shean horn let lie of luxury and Madrid.

507
00:30:42.710 --> 00:30:47.330
Former president Perran never stopped looking for Avitas embalmed remains in

508
00:30:47.530 --> 00:30:51.970
1971 out of nowhere came the revelation that Avita had been secretly buried in a

509
00:30:52.410 --> 00:30:55.370
cemetery in Milan under a headstone bearing a different name.

510
00:30:55.770 --> 00:30:59.490
Juan Perran recovered her body had it restored by a mortician and kept it for

511
00:30:59.491 --> 00:31:01.890
some days in his Madrid home. Not just anywhere though,

512
00:31:02.060 --> 00:31:04.400
he had it lying on a table in his living room,

513
00:31:04.580 --> 00:31:08.920
and Isabelle would be asked to brush Avi's hair every day to make sure it didn't

514
00:31:09.040 --> 00:31:12.240
tangle. I'm not gonna comment on this in the video, but feel free to below.

515
00:31:12.780 --> 00:31:17.160
So back to normality in 1973, public pressure in Argentina demanded for,

516
00:31:17.720 --> 00:31:18.760
to resign from his exile,

517
00:31:18.820 --> 00:31:23.350
the presidents in charge general and news complied and invited quant return to

518
00:31:23.351 --> 00:31:27.670
the Homeland. So Juan and Isabelle moved back to Buenos airs on June the 20th,

519
00:31:27.950 --> 00:31:31.990
1973. Leus had also called for general elections to take place in March,

520
00:31:32.170 --> 00:31:35.190
but it made a point that Perran should not be allowed to run.

521
00:31:35.380 --> 00:31:38.670
This was not a problem as he participated and won by proxy,

522
00:31:38.990 --> 00:31:42.910
a revived just east steel party put forward another candidate, Mr. Campo,

523
00:31:43.400 --> 00:31:47.860
who won with a thin majority of 49.59% after taking power camp

524
00:31:48.090 --> 00:31:51.060
immediately resigned, initiating new elections in September,

525
00:31:51.070 --> 00:31:52.380
which of course allowed for,

526
00:31:52.560 --> 00:31:56.940
to participate pretty S slime move Hornan Isabelle Parran campaign together as

527
00:31:56.941 --> 00:32:01.060
president and vice president respectively scoring a 60% victory by the end of

528
00:32:01.061 --> 00:32:04.730
the year, Juan had become president of Argentina for a time with his wife.

529
00:32:04.970 --> 00:32:08.370
A second in command. Isabel had succeeded in gaining the vice presidency,

530
00:32:08.610 --> 00:32:12.130
a post that would've perfectly suited a Vita if it weren't for her illness,

531
00:32:12.730 --> 00:32:14.210
bronze, that, um, was short-lived though,

532
00:32:14.230 --> 00:32:17.090
as he died of a heart attack on July the first 1974,

533
00:32:17.150 --> 00:32:20.490
Isabel succeeded him as president's the first female head of government in the

534
00:32:20.491 --> 00:32:24.560
Western hemisphere. So I really hope you enjoyed today's super long video.

535
00:32:24.780 --> 00:32:27.280
The story of this couple was just really interesting.

536
00:32:27.340 --> 00:32:31.600
So we felt that it deserves some extra time, feel free to, you know, like share,

537
00:32:31.960 --> 00:32:34.480
subscribe, et cetera. And we've just got a final question for you.

538
00:32:34.580 --> 00:32:38.320
