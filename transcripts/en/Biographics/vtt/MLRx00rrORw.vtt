6
00:00:21.380 --> 00:00:23.120
Towards the middle of the 14th century,

7
00:00:23.180 --> 00:00:27.470
a terrible plague struck at the people of the East and the West.

8
00:00:27.620 --> 00:00:29.510
It crudely mistreated the nations.

9
00:00:29.660 --> 00:00:32.510
It carried away a great part of that generation.

10
00:00:32.840 --> 00:00:37.340
It swept away and destroyed the most beautiful achievements of civilization.

11
00:00:37.490 --> 00:00:39.650
It shattered the forces vampires,

12
00:00:39.740 --> 00:00:44.480
snuffed their vigor weakened that power to the point of total destruction.

13
00:00:44.540 --> 00:00:49.220
It was as if the voice of nature and then ordered the world to humble

14
00:00:49.221 --> 00:00:51.650
itself. And the weld had a bait.

15
00:00:51.830 --> 00:00:56.600
These words were written in 1377 by Tunisian scholar and historian

16
00:00:58.560 --> 00:00:59.000
[inaudible].

17
00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:03.320
He was talking about the single greatest catastrophe in the history of mankind.

18
00:01:03.470 --> 00:01:07.070
Up until that point, the black death, which reached North Africa in Europe,

19
00:01:07.071 --> 00:01:08.180
in the 1340s,

20
00:01:08.181 --> 00:01:13.100
but even Caledonia was not referring exclusively to that pandemic

21
00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:17.000
modern accounts of the black death usually focus on the first wave,

22
00:01:17.030 --> 00:01:20.750
but rarely cover it's returned to the shores of the old world,

23
00:01:20.810 --> 00:01:24.410
but only a decade after the initial outbreak inhabitants of Europe and the

24
00:01:24.411 --> 00:01:26.360
Mediterranean basin would again,

25
00:01:26.390 --> 00:01:30.260
suffer from a second sweep of the grim angel. This time,

26
00:01:30.290 --> 00:01:31.490
the more innocent would fall.

27
00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:35.120
The black death that redox became known as the plague of children.

28
00:01:40.850 --> 00:01:41.670
<v 1>[Inaudible].</v>

29
00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:43.940
<v 0>Death is the name we give to date to the pandemic,</v>

30
00:01:43.941 --> 00:01:47.330
which killed between one third and two thirds of the world's population.

31
00:01:47.360 --> 00:01:49.130
The first half of the 14th century,

32
00:01:49.160 --> 00:01:53.990
the epidemic likely originated in central Asia or in China in the early 1330s.

33
00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:55.220
It then spread to Europe,

34
00:01:55.250 --> 00:01:59.780
the Mediterranean and Africa carried by caravans of merchants along the silk

35
00:01:59.781 --> 00:02:03.710
road, as well as Bango cavalry by September of 1347,

36
00:02:03.890 --> 00:02:07.970
the black death appeared in Southern Italy as an uninvited guest on merchant

37
00:02:07.971 --> 00:02:10.340
ships. From that traveling mostly by sea,

38
00:02:10.341 --> 00:02:14.720
this mysterious disease conquered most of Europe and Africa eventually subsiding

39
00:02:14.721 --> 00:02:18.380
in the early 1350s. When I say mysterious, I mean,

40
00:02:18.381 --> 00:02:22.040
from the points of view of witnesses of that time, contemporary historians,

41
00:02:22.041 --> 00:02:26.480
archeologists and medical professionals identify the most likely culprits.

42
00:02:26.540 --> 00:02:31.340
The black death was an extremely virulent and infectious pandemic of bubonic and

43
00:02:31.370 --> 00:02:35.990
pneumonic plague caused by a bacterium called Yesenia pestos or

44
00:02:36.080 --> 00:02:39.410
Y pestis. The bacteria used fleas as vectors,

45
00:02:39.440 --> 00:02:43.460
which in turn traveled on the fairway of rats and other rodents after infecting

46
00:02:43.461 --> 00:02:46.790
and killing their animal hosts, the fleas would attack humans.

47
00:02:46.850 --> 00:02:48.770
If you want to know more about the black death,

48
00:02:48.771 --> 00:02:53.090
you can absolutely watch our biographic special back from Halloween last year,

49
00:02:53.091 --> 00:02:55.130
2019 today, though,

50
00:02:55.160 --> 00:02:59.980
we're going to focus on the period immediately after the pestilence of 1347 and

51
00:02:59.981 --> 00:03:04.810
especially about the so-called second play go second pestilence or

52
00:03:04.840 --> 00:03:07.750
the plague of children. This was the second outbreak,

53
00:03:07.751 --> 00:03:11.110
which ravaged Europe from 1360 to 1364.

54
00:03:11.290 --> 00:03:14.980
And I will take the occasion to review and contrast some theories,

55
00:03:14.981 --> 00:03:19.660
which argue that these epidemics were not playing outbreaks and that why pestos

56
00:03:19.661 --> 00:03:23.440
and its complimentary fleas and ramps were innocence,

57
00:03:23.680 --> 00:03:27.010
but let's stick to the criminal logy of events for the moments in the early

58
00:03:27.011 --> 00:03:30.880
1350s, the black death had finally given some rest bites to Europe,

59
00:03:30.910 --> 00:03:34.330
most souls are swept away by the normal occurrences,

60
00:03:35.010 --> 00:03:36.660
Vieira famine endemic disease.

61
00:03:36.690 --> 00:03:41.160
The hundred years war the on the scene angel of death has laid down its broom

62
00:03:41.550 --> 00:03:45.960
for the moment. But what type of society has arisen after the catastrophe,

63
00:03:46.140 --> 00:03:46.920
as I mentioned,

64
00:03:46.920 --> 00:03:51.330
as much as two thirds of the population has died in an agony of fevers and

65
00:03:51.450 --> 00:03:55.560
swollen black boobos, this men's fields and farms were empty.

66
00:03:55.710 --> 00:03:59.250
Some of the remaining survivors in the countryside abandons their dwellings and

67
00:03:59.251 --> 00:04:01.470
to move to the cities, looking for a fresh start.

68
00:04:01.530 --> 00:04:05.190
They were also looking to enjoy the benefits offered by city authorities,

69
00:04:05.191 --> 00:04:06.450
seeking to replenish their numbers.

70
00:04:06.451 --> 00:04:09.330
Municipal leaders were keen to attract new residents.

71
00:04:09.570 --> 00:04:12.060
Other survivors decided to remain in the countryside.

72
00:04:12.090 --> 00:04:16.500
Labor was now SCAs and peasants and farm tenants could now negotiate higher

73
00:04:16.501 --> 00:04:17.880
wages and lower rents.

74
00:04:17.940 --> 00:04:22.170
The demographics of landowners have also changed within Tanya families wiped out

75
00:04:22.320 --> 00:04:25.380
large plots of lands were left without anybody to inherit them,

76
00:04:25.620 --> 00:04:26.700
except for them church,

77
00:04:26.701 --> 00:04:30.600
which used the aftermath of the blank death to greatly increase its properties,

78
00:04:30.750 --> 00:04:32.070
wealth and power.

79
00:04:32.220 --> 00:04:35.700
Another consequence of the black death was a downshift in the nature of warfare.

80
00:04:35.880 --> 00:04:39.000
There were a few men of fighting age, and especially if you are peasants,

81
00:04:39.001 --> 00:04:42.240
that could be levied to raise armies. So in the 1350s,

82
00:04:42.270 --> 00:04:47.010
feudal Lords and monarchs had to rely more and more on companies of mercenaries.

83
00:04:47.040 --> 00:04:49.230
These were private armies traveling frequently,

84
00:04:49.231 --> 00:04:53.160
either shifting theater of operations or simply switching sides.

85
00:04:53.400 --> 00:04:56.790
It can be argued that large numbers of traveling soldiers in unsanitary

86
00:04:56.791 --> 00:05:00.240
conditions may be a recipe for a pestilence disaster,

87
00:05:00.270 --> 00:05:04.650
but in the first half of the 1350s, no new epidemics were recorded in Europe.

88
00:05:04.770 --> 00:05:05.250
Well,

89
00:05:05.250 --> 00:05:09.690
except for one of an unconventional sought an outbreak of marriages take the

90
00:05:09.691 --> 00:05:11.070
French town of shivery,

91
00:05:11.760 --> 00:05:16.260
130 kilometers North of neon shivery was the hardest by the black death in 1348,

92
00:05:16.320 --> 00:05:19.950
the town registers acknowledged zero marriages taking place that yet,

93
00:05:19.980 --> 00:05:24.300
but in 1349, 42 lucky couples sealed their vows.

94
00:05:24.480 --> 00:05:28.110
A similar situation was described in Britain by historian, JC Russell.

95
00:05:28.140 --> 00:05:32.280
He argues that the black death in Britain killed only 20% of those aged between

96
00:05:32.281 --> 00:05:36.450
10 to 35, but exacted a much higher toll amongst the parents.

97
00:05:36.480 --> 00:05:40.350
So the younger generations having now inherited and it's become financially

98
00:05:40.351 --> 00:05:41.184
independent.

99
00:05:41.340 --> 00:05:45.330
We're all too eager to marry a spike in marriages naturally led to an increase

100
00:05:45.331 --> 00:05:49.410
in birth rates. One could even say that humanity was bouncing back. Well,

101
00:05:49.411 --> 00:05:53.340
that nature was trying to compensate for the tremendous losses that the human

102
00:05:53.341 --> 00:05:57.350
race had suffered. I know that life in the late middle ages, wasn't a picnic,

103
00:05:57.351 --> 00:06:00.740
especially if you were French or English, slugging it out for decades.

104
00:06:00.741 --> 00:06:02.390
On end the aftermath of the black death.

105
00:06:02.420 --> 00:06:06.470
They must've felt like a relief after years and years of pain. Finally,

106
00:06:06.500 --> 00:06:10.610
the giggles of children and nursery rhymes would fill the app, but alas,

107
00:06:10.970 --> 00:06:11.803
it wouldn't look.

108
00:06:18.040 --> 00:06:18.190
<v 2>[Inaudible].</v>

109
00:06:18.190 --> 00:06:20.860
<v 0>The black death of 1347 had launched lead sped,</v>

110
00:06:20.861 --> 00:06:24.910
the lands of Bohemia and Southern Poland during its March of conquest.

111
00:06:25.060 --> 00:06:25.900
In 1352,

112
00:06:26.020 --> 00:06:29.560
the play could reach the vast lands of Russia before apparently subsume leading

113
00:06:29.770 --> 00:06:34.450
in a way death had returned home after starting its journey in central Asia,

114
00:06:34.510 --> 00:06:35.350
five years later,

115
00:06:35.380 --> 00:06:39.970
the disease popped up again in 1357 records show that a second pestilence had

116
00:06:39.971 --> 00:06:43.960
reached Prague ravaging the city over the course of several outbreaks that lost

117
00:06:43.961 --> 00:06:46.660
it until 1368 and 1359.

118
00:06:46.780 --> 00:06:50.590
Evidence shows that the play you could cross into modern day Germany with cases

119
00:06:51.060 --> 00:06:53.160
recorded in the city of [inaudible] in the region of suedey.

120
00:06:53.380 --> 00:06:57.880
The contagion cuts through Germany from East to West and crossed the Rhine into

121
00:06:57.881 --> 00:06:59.980
the kingdom of France. In 1360,

122
00:06:59.981 --> 00:07:03.250
the epidemic could reach the Fest city of Avignon in Southern France,

123
00:07:03.251 --> 00:07:08.080
which had served as the residents of the paper seasons 35. As you may imagine,

124
00:07:08.110 --> 00:07:12.250
such an important city was teaming with clergymen bishops, Aras to craps,

125
00:07:12.251 --> 00:07:15.940
and the best physicians that money could buy. One of them was Dr. Guida,

126
00:07:16.330 --> 00:07:16.690
Shirley ACC,

127
00:07:16.690 --> 00:07:21.070
who left a precious testimony of his experience with the second play gins,

128
00:07:21.310 --> 00:07:25.150
the atmosphere of despair and paranoia that gripped his fellow citizens.

129
00:07:25.151 --> 00:07:28.810
It reads many were in doubt about the cause of this great mortality.

130
00:07:28.870 --> 00:07:32.410
In some places, they thought that the Jews had poisoned the world.

131
00:07:32.411 --> 00:07:36.580
And so they killed them in others that it was the poor deformed and they drove

132
00:07:36.670 --> 00:07:40.690
the mouse and others that it was the Nobles and they fit to go abroad.

133
00:07:41.080 --> 00:07:44.470
The lynching of Jewish communities was unfortunately an all too common

134
00:07:45.130 --> 00:07:48.400
by-product of this pandemic as well as 1347 outbreak.

135
00:07:48.550 --> 00:07:52.060
Even the Pope had called for Christians not to slay their fellow Jewish

136
00:07:52.061 --> 00:07:56.740
citizens, but senseless death breeds panic in turn, panic breeds,

137
00:07:56.741 --> 00:07:59.440
violence and violent crowds need a scapegoat.

138
00:07:59.560 --> 00:08:03.730
Jewish communities were perceived to suffer fewer deaths than Christian ones.

139
00:08:03.731 --> 00:08:06.790
And so it was easy to blame them as the cause of the plague.

140
00:08:06.910 --> 00:08:11.140
These acts of violence when recorded could be used by historians to trace the

141
00:08:11.141 --> 00:08:14.410
progress of the contagion. For example, a French authors, John Glenn,

142
00:08:14.500 --> 00:08:18.490
his song was able to determine that the second play could reach Poland in 1630

143
00:08:18.730 --> 00:08:20.080
after finding Jewish eulogies,

144
00:08:20.081 --> 00:08:23.140
commemorating the slang of martyrs and crack out Dennis Dolan,

145
00:08:23.610 --> 00:08:27.040
competitive for the ponies records with writings by just Shirley acted after

146
00:08:27.041 --> 00:08:29.800
your, and they all highlight the same conclusion,

147
00:08:29.830 --> 00:08:33.340
the second pestilence reaped victims across the societal spectrum,

148
00:08:33.520 --> 00:08:37.720
but it had a predilection for certain profiles of victims. Young men.

149
00:08:37.840 --> 00:08:41.680
I have a women as members of the upper classes over the lower classes,

150
00:08:41.920 --> 00:08:45.190
but most of all, we're child victims, age 13 or younger.

151
00:08:45.280 --> 00:08:49.120
These were the children who had been born after the black death had disappeared

152
00:08:49.300 --> 00:08:52.270
who were now being struck down by this new plague.

153
00:08:52.420 --> 00:08:55.890
What would it have been like to be a parents in those days, consider this.

154
00:08:55.891 --> 00:08:59.070
You have survived the single deadliest event in the history of humanity.

155
00:08:59.190 --> 00:09:04.080
You have risen from despair and found the strength to start a new life and to

156
00:09:04.081 --> 00:09:06.720
create new life. And only a few years later,

157
00:09:06.840 --> 00:09:11.820
that same invisible monster who was killed half of those you ever knew and never

158
00:09:11.821 --> 00:09:15.720
loved while that monster returns and kills the young person.

159
00:09:15.750 --> 00:09:18.780
Who's now given new meaning to your existence.

160
00:09:19.020 --> 00:09:22.620
One year after the doctor to show Leanne had recorded his findings,

161
00:09:22.621 --> 00:09:26.250
the plague had reached Paris. It was the summer of 1361. Here.

162
00:09:26.251 --> 00:09:29.640
Chronicle has confirmed that children died by the thousands,

163
00:09:29.760 --> 00:09:33.060
but they also noted that the illness guilds scores of young men in the late

164
00:09:33.061 --> 00:09:35.850
teens, early twenties, but sped their young lives.

165
00:09:35.940 --> 00:09:37.920
They described how the streets of Paris,

166
00:09:38.280 --> 00:09:40.740
half emptied were strewn by silent shadows,

167
00:09:40.890 --> 00:09:45.810
gliding away with our eyes lowered to the grounds of city of widows platinum

168
00:09:45.811 --> 00:09:50.370
black. You have started to spot a pattern here, Bohemia, Poland, young men,

169
00:09:50.640 --> 00:09:55.020
children, even the upper classes, areas and populations, which had been spared.

170
00:09:55.050 --> 00:09:59.580
The ordeal of the 1347 panic were now succumbing to the second

171
00:09:59.581 --> 00:10:00.330
plague.

172
00:10:00.330 --> 00:10:04.560
This trend was confirmed by the pattern of contagion in the Italian peninsula.

173
00:10:04.830 --> 00:10:06.690
Now, just before we continue with today's video,

174
00:10:06.691 --> 00:10:09.660
I think it's time we take a little breather, take a little break.

175
00:10:09.720 --> 00:10:11.010
This one's pretty intense.

176
00:10:11.310 --> 00:10:14.490
And I want to tell you about today's sponsor Squarespace. Now,

177
00:10:14.520 --> 00:10:15.360
two simple things.

178
00:10:15.450 --> 00:10:19.380
Maybe you've got an idea for a website or a business that you'll want to stop us

179
00:10:19.390 --> 00:10:22.110
and you know, just knocking around there and your minds. Well,

180
00:10:22.320 --> 00:10:25.590
to the only way to figure out whether that business is worth pursuing is to get

181
00:10:25.591 --> 00:10:26.490
it out there into the world.

182
00:10:26.500 --> 00:10:30.150
And I know this can be a little bit scary because it's always scary to go and

183
00:10:30.151 --> 00:10:33.990
try new things. But knowing how to set up a website is not an excuse.

184
00:10:34.020 --> 00:10:37.020
And there are no excuses available with Squarespace.

185
00:10:37.080 --> 00:10:39.870
Squarespace allows you to create a powerful website, whatever you're up to.

186
00:10:40.170 --> 00:10:44.250
I want to sell something online. Yes. Set up a store. You want to do a podcast?

187
00:10:44.610 --> 00:10:47.070
Absolutely. Totally can do that as well.

188
00:10:47.130 --> 00:10:49.740
Now it all starts on Squarespace with a beautiful template that you can

189
00:10:49.741 --> 00:10:54.690
customize to your heart's content or start from scratch or move over from

190
00:10:54.691 --> 00:10:58.620
an existing domain. But take my advice just even on their beautiful templates,

191
00:10:58.770 --> 00:11:00.420
you'll look at them. You'll be like, well,

192
00:11:00.540 --> 00:11:03.750
I couldn't design anything that looks not good. So let's just use that.

193
00:11:03.780 --> 00:11:06.750
And once you've got it up and running, there's no tech BS to deal with.

194
00:11:06.751 --> 00:11:08.280
There's no updates, patches, stuff like that.

195
00:11:08.281 --> 00:11:09.270
You didn't have to worry about that.

196
00:11:09.330 --> 00:11:13.050
Also Squarespace sounds a little of the website stuff, podcasts, like I said,

197
00:11:13.051 --> 00:11:15.180
maintenance, social integrations, all that stuff.

198
00:11:15.420 --> 00:11:19.620
Plus they have 24 seven support. So out's fantastic. I mean, honestly,

199
00:11:19.621 --> 00:11:23.230
you're probably not going to get stuck. It's pretty easy. But if you do like,

200
00:11:23.430 --> 00:11:26.370
hi Squarespace, I need some help and they will help.

to save 10% off your first purchase of a website or a domain

204
00:11:42.470 --> 00:11:44.720
In 1362 and 1363,

205
00:11:44.721 --> 00:11:48.740
the second pestilence crossed the Alps and made its returned to Italy areas that

206
00:11:48.741 --> 00:11:52.790
had survived. The first pestilence, largely unscathed went out, punished by the,

207
00:11:53.500 --> 00:11:55.390
of the new contagion. In this case,

208
00:11:55.510 --> 00:11:58.810
the target was Milan city authorities that successfully protected that

209
00:11:58.811 --> 00:12:02.440
population by enforcing a strict quarantine in 1348.

210
00:12:02.650 --> 00:12:05.890
But now they were taken by surprise from Milan and Lombardi,

211
00:12:05.891 --> 00:12:08.770
the plague spread to the East and the Venetia region.

212
00:12:09.010 --> 00:12:13.900
And then Southwoods reaching PR sends us some 70 miles Southeast of Milan

213
00:12:13.990 --> 00:12:17.860
here and unnamed chronic Allah left a vivid description of the outward signs of

214
00:12:17.861 --> 00:12:21.370
the second pestilence in some of the dying and excretion coagulated in the

215
00:12:21.371 --> 00:12:24.250
boobos under the armpits or on the groin in others,

216
00:12:24.940 --> 00:12:28.210
postulates or abscesses formed around the heads, especially behind the years,

217
00:12:28.420 --> 00:12:32.830
others yet spat a putrid blood, which was a very bad sign, a burning fever,

218
00:12:32.890 --> 00:12:36.100
suffocated all of them after two or three days of manifesting.

219
00:12:36.520 --> 00:12:40.930
Our friends in PSN also explains how he have survived in patients who had

220
00:12:40.931 --> 00:12:42.550
developed a is on the groin.

221
00:12:42.730 --> 00:12:45.910
If those tumors became softer and the fever diminished,

222
00:12:45.940 --> 00:12:49.840
if the bubo was covered in plaster of lawns and more of,

223
00:12:49.841 --> 00:12:52.870
and then lost with a hot iron and depleted of secretions,

224
00:12:53.080 --> 00:12:56.740
then the patient was healed. This description is just one of the many kills,

225
00:12:56.741 --> 00:12:58.120
which circulated at the time,

226
00:12:58.330 --> 00:13:01.420
the most widely reprinted was a treatise written by I,

227
00:13:01.540 --> 00:13:05.560
the Bishop of ALCL Dr. A physique. In other words,

228
00:13:05.561 --> 00:13:08.590
the Bishop of all hosts in Denmark who claimed to have studied medicine at

229
00:13:08.591 --> 00:13:12.100
Montpellier university or announced center of medieval medical studies,

230
00:13:12.250 --> 00:13:12.940
fun facts,

231
00:13:12.940 --> 00:13:16.270
two centuries later Montpellier would be the Alma mater of another famous plague

232
00:13:16.300 --> 00:13:17.133
doctor in profit.

233
00:13:17.710 --> 00:13:22.540
Michelle did not tra Don AKA Nostradamus since we have a video profile all about

234
00:13:22.541 --> 00:13:24.460
him as well. So if you want to check that out,

235
00:13:24.461 --> 00:13:28.840
please do the Bishop believe that the disease was propagated by venomous humors,

236
00:13:28.870 --> 00:13:31.630
which entered the victims, outweighs burden this from happening.

237
00:13:31.631 --> 00:13:35.560
He recommended holding a loaf of bread or a sponge soaked in vinegar next to

238
00:13:35.561 --> 00:13:39.580
one's mouth, all egg things stop in the way of humans.

239
00:13:39.760 --> 00:13:41.800
He taught to look out for signs of warning,

240
00:13:41.801 --> 00:13:45.280
which may alert to the incoming pestilence. These aren't swarms of flies,

241
00:13:45.430 --> 00:13:47.200
shooting stars, comments, thunder,

242
00:13:47.201 --> 00:13:51.040
and lightening coming from the South and Southern the wins

243
00:13:54.920 --> 00:13:58.980
or vapors could be generated by any factor which may corrupt the app,

244
00:13:59.010 --> 00:14:03.570
the dead carrion, still waters in a ditch, or even a privy AKA toilet.

245
00:14:03.630 --> 00:14:07.470
These vapors may poison either the air or the grounds when both elements are

246
00:14:07.471 --> 00:14:10.260
corrupted and infirmity is caused in man,

247
00:14:10.410 --> 00:14:14.250
the formidable physician explains why some people fall ill while others are

248
00:14:14.251 --> 00:14:15.570
immune. According to him,

249
00:14:15.720 --> 00:14:20.700
bodies that are more hot disposed will be an easy prey to contagion by hot

250
00:14:21.270 --> 00:14:23.970
disposed humans. People whose poles were more open than normal.

251
00:14:24.000 --> 00:14:25.980
This happens if they had an angry temper,

252
00:14:25.981 --> 00:14:29.310
if they engaged in hauling physical labor, if they bathe too often,

253
00:14:29.460 --> 00:14:31.890
or if they abuse themselves with women,

254
00:14:31.920 --> 00:14:34.950
the Bishop addresses the question of person to person contagion.

255
00:14:35.010 --> 00:14:37.320
While the primary infection may be caused by humans,

256
00:14:37.470 --> 00:14:40.110
a diseased individual will develop boils and sores,

257
00:14:40.111 --> 00:14:43.650
which in turn will release toxic vapors infecting bystanders.

258
00:14:43.710 --> 00:14:45.390
Now we may have gotten the causes all wrong,

259
00:14:45.391 --> 00:14:48.960
but he nails this next piece of advice and pestilence time,

260
00:14:48.990 --> 00:14:53.030
nobody should stand in great press of people because some man of them may be.

261
00:14:53.031 --> 00:14:55.610
In fact, also in the time of the pestilence,

262
00:14:55.760 --> 00:15:00.440
it is better to abide within the house for it is not wholesome to go into the

263
00:15:00.441 --> 00:15:03.950
city or town to get rid of vapors infected individuals should change the

264
00:15:03.951 --> 00:15:07.070
chamber. They sleep in and have their windows open to the North and East,

265
00:15:07.100 --> 00:15:10.580
but never to the South. And why not to the South? Well, because hot winds.

266
00:15:12.100 --> 00:15:13.570
<v 4>Open the pores, of course.</v>

267
00:15:13.840 --> 00:15:17.590
<v 0>As an added precaution against contagion households were encouraged to purify</v>

268
00:15:17.591 --> 00:15:22.060
the ad by spraying vinegar and Rose water or by burning hubs, such as Bay tree,

269
00:15:22.180 --> 00:15:26.800
Juniper, wormwood, and something called this, which I've never heard of.

270
00:15:26.801 --> 00:15:29.470
And it's not going to be in my pronunciation, diction rape.

271
00:15:29.530 --> 00:15:31.330
When it comes to curing the infected,

272
00:15:31.331 --> 00:15:35.410
the Bishop's advice was to bleed the patients until they fainted for a little

273
00:15:35.770 --> 00:15:38.380
lessening of blood moveth or stare at the venom.

274
00:15:38.470 --> 00:15:42.490
Clearly neither the lens advice from ahas, nor from the writer,

275
00:15:42.520 --> 00:15:45.820
PSN could work for all of those affected the plague,

276
00:15:45.850 --> 00:15:49.240
took another leap in a southeasterly direction, reaching Balone yet here,

277
00:15:49.241 --> 00:15:51.370
the contagion was stubborn and unforgiving.

278
00:15:51.400 --> 00:15:54.820
The first cases were recorded as early as January, 1362.

279
00:15:55.000 --> 00:15:58.840
And the citizens of this fast city continued to die for the next 13 months while

280
00:15:58.841 --> 00:16:01.180
I belong here was systematically decimated.

281
00:16:01.420 --> 00:16:05.140
The speed of travel for the second black death seemed to have slowed down,

282
00:16:05.170 --> 00:16:09.730
but it was only a temporary response in 1363, death moved to Tuscany,

283
00:16:09.970 --> 00:16:12.880
then central Italy by June incidental, Naples,

284
00:16:13.150 --> 00:16:15.250
its gateway to the rest of Southern Italy.

285
00:16:15.460 --> 00:16:19.000
When death kicked open the door to Naples have completed its invasion of the

286
00:16:19.001 --> 00:16:21.190
major port cities of the Mediterranean basin,

287
00:16:21.460 --> 00:16:25.720
traveling merchants and sailors were efficient vectors of the plague, Barcelona,

288
00:16:25.750 --> 00:16:30.730
Crete, Damascus monk, other port cities to endure the cruel call.

289
00:16:30.760 --> 00:16:35.260
The generalized mortality appear to subside in Italy only in mid 1364,

290
00:16:35.261 --> 00:16:39.190
although it continued to haunt the canals of Venice for much longer Italian

291
00:16:39.191 --> 00:16:42.850
Chronicles and historians have observed an interesting point about the timing

292
00:16:42.851 --> 00:16:44.110
aspect of the second plague.

293
00:16:44.170 --> 00:16:47.320
It killed about as quickly as the first one after about five days from the

294
00:16:47.321 --> 00:16:49.000
appearance of the first signs,

295
00:16:49.180 --> 00:16:53.140
but its geographic spread was much slower compared to the original black death.

296
00:16:53.230 --> 00:16:57.130
The pandemic had blazed through the peninsula South to North in 10 months.

297
00:16:57.220 --> 00:17:00.430
The second one instead had lingered on for almost three years,

298
00:17:00.431 --> 00:17:04.510
taking its times and they ruined a depleted populations before marching on to

299
00:17:04.511 --> 00:17:05.410
another location.

300
00:17:05.560 --> 00:17:09.160
The slower spread may be explained by the more selective nature of the killer in

301
00:17:09.161 --> 00:17:10.120
1361.

302
00:17:10.180 --> 00:17:13.810
Most European Chronicle is agree on the point that children and young men were

303
00:17:13.811 --> 00:17:15.160
the favorite victims of this plague.

304
00:17:15.190 --> 00:17:17.920
Young men especially were more physically mobile by killing them.

305
00:17:17.921 --> 00:17:21.820
The pathogens also reduce their own chances to travel as low as spreads.

306
00:17:21.880 --> 00:17:25.300
However did not prevent the plague of children from reaching all the corners of

307
00:17:25.301 --> 00:17:27.820
the continent. Our next destination will be Britain. Well,

308
00:17:27.821 --> 00:17:30.850
we'll take a look at the detailed records left by the bishops of Winchester.

309
00:17:31.060 --> 00:17:31.893
<v 4>Yeah.</v>

310
00:17:37.780 --> 00:17:41.620
<v 0>We'll tax the public crony on tells us how the second play outbreak began in</v>

311
00:17:41.621 --> 00:17:46.300
London during Easter of 1361 and then moved to invade the rest of Southern

312
00:17:46.301 --> 00:17:47.410
England like in France,

313
00:17:47.440 --> 00:17:50.370
Italy or Poland is the pestilence laid waste among children,

314
00:17:50.550 --> 00:17:53.040
young men and the wealthier rungs of society.

315
00:17:53.070 --> 00:17:57.930
Whereas Nobles in clergymen had Indiana mortality rates of 4.5% in 1348 and

316
00:17:58.110 --> 00:17:59.910
13% in 1349,

317
00:17:59.940 --> 00:18:04.530
nearly 24% of the upper classes were killed by the fire bu-bye is in 1361,

318
00:18:04.710 --> 00:18:06.510
but when it comes to the general death rates,

319
00:18:06.630 --> 00:18:10.710
all Chronicles and records agree that it was not as high as the one experience

320
00:18:10.720 --> 00:18:11.670
during the black death.

321
00:18:11.820 --> 00:18:15.090
Approximately one quarter of the population died during the second plague,

322
00:18:15.120 --> 00:18:18.300
which is still a horrifying figure out of context,

323
00:18:18.570 --> 00:18:23.010
but might be the less than half the figure for many, a decade earlier. However,

324
00:18:23.011 --> 00:18:27.030
the second plagues impact on society was equally devastating. If not more.

325
00:18:27.031 --> 00:18:29.520
So the population had not fully recovered yet.

326
00:18:29.580 --> 00:18:31.710
It was subjected to a second call.

327
00:18:31.770 --> 00:18:35.520
The demise of the more innocent victims had a profound effect on the morale of

328
00:18:35.521 --> 00:18:38.850
those who were left behind the waste laid by the second plate in Britain is

329
00:18:38.851 --> 00:18:40.230
generally well-documented.

330
00:18:40.231 --> 00:18:44.730
But the records held in the diocese of Winchester offer a particularly detailed

331
00:18:44.760 --> 00:18:45.593
pictures.

332
00:18:45.660 --> 00:18:49.230
We have learned from an excellent paper by John Mullen of Cardiff university,

333
00:18:49.290 --> 00:18:52.890
the bishops of Winchester oversaw 60 manners spread over a large area,

334
00:18:52.891 --> 00:18:54.420
which included six counties.

335
00:18:54.630 --> 00:18:58.290
The records left behind by the diocese gave a detailed accounts of the

336
00:18:58.291 --> 00:19:01.710
demographics of the outbreak during the 1348 black death.

337
00:19:01.740 --> 00:19:05.460
The Winchester lambs that suffered a death rate of 48.8%.

338
00:19:05.461 --> 00:19:07.260
One of the highest in the British Isles,

339
00:19:07.410 --> 00:19:11.840
but [inaudible] had been launched really SPAD but in 1361, priests,

340
00:19:11.900 --> 00:19:16.580
Abbots and nuns were not so lucky around 30% of them died despite having a

341
00:19:16.581 --> 00:19:20.420
generally better diet and living conditions than the majority of the populace.

342
00:19:20.480 --> 00:19:23.570
By looking at the inheritance deeds recorded in the six counties under the

343
00:19:23.571 --> 00:19:24.080
Bishop,

344
00:19:24.080 --> 00:19:28.100
John Mullen was able to confirm that the second plague had a predilection for

345
00:19:28.101 --> 00:19:32.360
male victims in 1349, almost 68% of all ads were mailed.

346
00:19:32.390 --> 00:19:36.680
This was in line with previously recorded trends and with customers of the age

347
00:19:37.010 --> 00:19:39.950
skipped to 1361. And now the majority of as well women,

348
00:19:40.070 --> 00:19:43.640
61% and among them widows had the relative majority.

349
00:19:43.730 --> 00:19:47.210
This tells us that most of the victims were probably men in their twenties or

350
00:19:47.211 --> 00:19:49.760
thirties whose children were too young to inherit.

351
00:19:49.761 --> 00:19:54.530
So even more likely whose children had been taken away by the great leveler

352
00:19:54.740 --> 00:19:57.320
who did not calf young age or innocence,

353
00:19:57.440 --> 00:20:00.590
the plague of children did not take long before it spread across Wales,

354
00:20:00.591 --> 00:20:03.080
Northern England and Scotland in manners, across Britain,

355
00:20:03.110 --> 00:20:06.860
inheritance deeds and tax accounts provide a consistent picture of which

356
00:20:06.861 --> 00:20:11.150
demographics succumbed and which survived. But beyond them in numbers,

357
00:20:11.240 --> 00:20:15.530
we would like to remember also the words of poets who were confronted with death

358
00:20:15.590 --> 00:20:16.700
Welsh poet, Llewellyn,

359
00:20:16.880 --> 00:20:21.470
fie Han recorded his experiences in 1363 and a poem haint E noodle,

360
00:20:21.500 --> 00:20:24.770
which would be translated as the infection of the nodes.

361
00:20:24.950 --> 00:20:29.390
The Whelan left us some vivid descriptions of the [inaudible] versus filled with

362
00:20:29.450 --> 00:20:32.180
hatred for an incomprehensible enemy to him.

363
00:20:32.210 --> 00:20:37.160
These swellings were like the pommel of a sword of Swift strife and the shape of

364
00:20:37.161 --> 00:20:41.690
an Apple and full of pain. They were the bitter head of an odious onion,

365
00:20:41.870 --> 00:20:45.590
a little boil, which spares no one's smoldering like a red hot, cold,

366
00:20:45.591 --> 00:20:50.050
a tiny thing, which about man's end. The poets survived the pandemic,

367
00:20:50.200 --> 00:20:53.890
but his four children were not so lucky. Morford was taken fair DAF.

368
00:20:53.891 --> 00:20:57.850
It was taken you and everyone's Gerry favorite was taken with an unceasing.

369
00:20:57.851 --> 00:21:01.630
The men's was taken and I was left feeling betrayed and stunned,

370
00:21:01.660 --> 00:21:05.440
barely alive in a harsh world, a harsh world, indeed.

371
00:21:05.680 --> 00:21:08.170
The second pestilence eventually waned down,

372
00:21:08.200 --> 00:21:13.120
but the plague never really left Europe alone returning for wave after wave.

373
00:21:13.360 --> 00:21:17.440
The disease returned in 1374 and then in 1383, 30, 90,

374
00:21:17.740 --> 00:21:22.150
and 1400, every subsequent wave was overall less deadly than the previous one.

375
00:21:22.210 --> 00:21:26.650
And I stress overall here. The total number of victims declined each time.

376
00:21:26.651 --> 00:21:27.970
But out of the total,

377
00:21:28.060 --> 00:21:32.560
the proportion of children involved increased statistics from burial places in

378
00:21:32.561 --> 00:21:34.990
Tuscany show. That's in 1383,

379
00:21:35.110 --> 00:21:38.050
88% of the plague victims were age 12 or younger.

380
00:21:38.230 --> 00:21:41.800
The true slaughter of the innocence following outbreaks appeared to be less

381
00:21:41.801 --> 00:21:42.820
cruel against children,

382
00:21:42.821 --> 00:21:46.720
but their combined efforts caused a lasting decline in the population of Europe,

383
00:21:46.721 --> 00:21:49.450
which recovered to pre at 1348 levels,

384
00:21:49.600 --> 00:21:53.560
only one and a half centuries later in the 1520s.

385
00:21:59.850 --> 00:21:59.880
<v 5>[Inaudible].</v>

386
00:21:59.880 --> 00:22:02.430
<v 0>The profound demographic change brought a balanced bite,</v>

387
00:22:02.431 --> 00:22:06.390
the plane cause lasting effects on the makeup of society. These were changes,

388
00:22:06.420 --> 00:22:10.860
which again were well-documented in England and may apply also to other parts of

389
00:22:10.861 --> 00:22:13.020
Europe. According to a story in column plats,

390
00:22:13.021 --> 00:22:17.280
the toll exacted on young males caused a widespread shortage of labor allowing

391
00:22:17.281 --> 00:22:19.080
for more women to enter the workforce.

392
00:22:19.110 --> 00:22:21.900
Now we also know that more women have become inheritors of wealth.

393
00:22:21.960 --> 00:22:25.290
The combined effect was that more women had become financially independent,

394
00:22:25.291 --> 00:22:29.280
which meant that they either decided to marry later or not marry at all leading

395
00:22:29.281 --> 00:22:30.480
to a decline in births.

396
00:22:30.540 --> 00:22:34.440
The shortage of labor also led to an increase in wages and an abundance of cheap

397
00:22:34.441 --> 00:22:36.600
land. As many plots were now abandoned.

398
00:22:36.750 --> 00:22:40.770
This meant that those couples who did marry what less motivated to have children

399
00:22:40.860 --> 00:22:43.830
in the middle ages, if you work to the lands and increase in children,

400
00:22:44.040 --> 00:22:47.760
mens an increase in cheap labor, but this was not a requirement anymore.

401
00:22:47.790 --> 00:22:52.140
Now that wealthier couples that access to cheaper land and other consequences of

402
00:22:52.141 --> 00:22:55.410
the labor shortage was a change in diet and pre play gears.

403
00:22:55.440 --> 00:22:58.710
Most land was used to grow cereals after the second pestilence,

404
00:22:58.711 --> 00:23:01.590
most arable plots were converted into Woodlands and pastures,

405
00:23:01.591 --> 00:23:05.190
which are less labor intensive. The typical Dodd for peasants and farmers,

406
00:23:05.191 --> 00:23:06.480
which used to be cereal,

407
00:23:06.481 --> 00:23:09.780
heavy changed to incorporate more meat and dairy products.

408
00:23:09.810 --> 00:23:13.620
The subsequent waves of the plague also impacted the traditional feudal

409
00:23:13.621 --> 00:23:17.610
relationship between the peasants and the aristocratic landlords before the

410
00:23:17.611 --> 00:23:18.000
plague,

411
00:23:18.000 --> 00:23:21.750
peasants were more accurately described as serfs and paid rent to the local Lord

412
00:23:21.870 --> 00:23:23.430
in cash, farm products and labor.

413
00:23:23.490 --> 00:23:26.460
They had to ask permission if the daughter wanted to marry a stranger from

414
00:23:26.461 --> 00:23:27.294
another village,

415
00:23:27.300 --> 00:23:31.290
they had to pay Harriet's special taxes upon the death of a household member.

416
00:23:31.410 --> 00:23:32.970
But by the end of the 14th century,

417
00:23:32.971 --> 00:23:37.080
those serfs had morphed into either small landowners themselves or free tenants

418
00:23:37.081 --> 00:23:41.850
free of most previous obligations except to pay a more reasonable rent in cash.

419
00:23:41.880 --> 00:23:45.380
The ruling class is obviously trying to resist these changes by imposing laws

420
00:23:45.381 --> 00:23:48.620
and does establishing a status go antsy after the plagues. However,

421
00:23:48.621 --> 00:23:52.760
these were unpopular reforms that eventually sparked the peasant revolt of 1381,

422
00:23:52.761 --> 00:23:57.110
which was led by legendary leader. What Tyler? Well, that's a story for another.

423
00:24:03.790 --> 00:24:04.623
<v 6>Studies.</v>

424
00:24:04.660 --> 00:24:08.680
<v 0>The effects of the plague of children and subsequent waves raised some questions</v>

425
00:24:08.710 --> 00:24:11.140
on the nature of the disease was the black death,

426
00:24:11.170 --> 00:24:15.670
actually an epidemic of bubonic plague caused by their sending up pestis

427
00:24:15.671 --> 00:24:16.390
bacteria.

428
00:24:16.390 --> 00:24:20.410
The implication of increased child mortality was the survival of older adults.

429
00:24:20.540 --> 00:24:24.700
So you had been exposed to previous epidemics. This suggests a quad immunity,

430
00:24:24.790 --> 00:24:28.060
according to professor Samuel cone of Glasgow university among others.

431
00:24:28.270 --> 00:24:32.770
This is not a characteristic of the bubonic plague in the 19th and 20th century.

432
00:24:32.771 --> 00:24:37.630
A pandemic of plague caused by Yesenia pestos spread from Hong Kong to China and

433
00:24:37.631 --> 00:24:41.440
India. Then to most coastal cities around the world, medical professionals,

434
00:24:41.441 --> 00:24:45.970
both then and now were able to observe the populations could be hit by returning

435
00:24:45.971 --> 00:24:49.690
waves of Yesenia and still suffer from the plague. In other words,

436
00:24:49.691 --> 00:24:52.240
they couldn't develop an immunity. Strangely enough,

437
00:24:52.241 --> 00:24:55.810
rats actually could develop a resistance which eventually lowered infection

438
00:24:55.811 --> 00:25:00.250
rates. Speaking of ramps that most common parasites or fleas in theory,

439
00:25:00.251 --> 00:25:02.980
these fleas were vectors for the plague bacteria.

440
00:25:03.070 --> 00:25:07.540
Y pestis they thrive during periods of malt climates like spring and autumn

441
00:25:07.570 --> 00:25:10.720
while they become inactive in summer and winds up this seasonal pass.

442
00:25:10.850 --> 00:25:13.450
And it should influence patterns of contagion movements,

443
00:25:13.480 --> 00:25:14.830
but both the black death.

444
00:25:14.860 --> 00:25:19.030
And the second plague did not follow these pattern and remained evenly lethal

445
00:25:19.031 --> 00:25:19.900
throughout the year.

446
00:25:19.960 --> 00:25:23.260
Another piece of evidence against bubonic plague is that medieval Chronicle is

447
00:25:23.380 --> 00:25:24.460
never mentioned rats.

448
00:25:24.520 --> 00:25:28.480
The modern plague pandemic demonstrated how human contagion is usually proceeded

449
00:25:28.481 --> 00:25:33.220
by large die-offs of rats and how rodents scurry out into the open in great

450
00:25:33.221 --> 00:25:34.420
numbers before dying.

451
00:25:34.510 --> 00:25:38.680
None of this is described during accounts from the 14th century critics of the

452
00:25:38.681 --> 00:25:39.910
bubonic plague hypothesis,

453
00:25:40.510 --> 00:25:43.780
speculates that the black death and subsequent pandemics were caused by another

454
00:25:43.781 --> 00:25:47.500
disease. Maybe it was typhus or smallpox or even the flu.

455
00:25:47.710 --> 00:25:52.150
Maybe it was a yet unknown illness supporters of team bubo defends their

456
00:25:52.151 --> 00:25:53.110
pathogen of choice.

457
00:25:53.111 --> 00:25:56.710
By claiming that white pestis may have been spread by other parasites,

458
00:25:56.890 --> 00:26:00.580
aside from the fleas, perhaps it was spread by human license.

459
00:26:00.700 --> 00:26:03.190
If medieval writers did not mention rats,

460
00:26:03.220 --> 00:26:07.450
this was because those rodents were so commonplace that there wasn't any reason

461
00:26:07.451 --> 00:26:11.590
to include them in that works would a contemporary blogger from London spent any

462
00:26:11.591 --> 00:26:15.520
time writing about pigeons in Trafalgar square proponents of the bubonic plague

463
00:26:15.550 --> 00:26:20.110
theory can call upon archeology to support their claims. In March of 2020,

464
00:26:20.111 --> 00:26:23.740
a mass burial of at least 48 individuals was Exuma now,

465
00:26:23.810 --> 00:26:26.350
medieval monastery and Lincoln share in the UK,

466
00:26:26.410 --> 00:26:30.280
the presence of coins with the image of King ed with the thirds and radiocarbon

467
00:26:30.281 --> 00:26:34.360
analysis helps date these bodies as having died between 1327 and

468
00:26:34.361 --> 00:26:37.690
1377 in the tooth, Paul put one bodies molar,

469
00:26:37.840 --> 00:26:42.010
the archeology team of professor Hugh Wilmer has found DNA sequences that match

470
00:26:42.011 --> 00:26:45.450
those of the pathogen that killed those poles souls. And yup.

471
00:26:45.600 --> 00:26:50.490
It was Yesenia pestos. So you might think case closed, right? Well,

472
00:26:50.520 --> 00:26:54.540
not necessarily traces of why pestos have been found in medieval mass graves

473
00:26:54.570 --> 00:26:57.300
since at least 2002, but in many cases,

474
00:26:57.301 --> 00:27:01.170
contamination and his methodology floors have invalidated the results.

475
00:27:01.230 --> 00:27:04.380
Regardless. There remains a central question to be answered.

476
00:27:04.470 --> 00:27:07.740
If recent outbreaks of people like plague did not generate immunity.

477
00:27:07.890 --> 00:27:12.000
Why did this happen during the plague of children and the later waves and MIT

478
00:27:12.001 --> 00:27:14.610
paper from 2007 may have found the answer.

479
00:27:14.670 --> 00:27:19.320
Maybe the medieval plague was a different strain of Y pestis in conjunction with

480
00:27:19.350 --> 00:27:22.920
a secondary infection that has yet to be identified for our past.

481
00:27:23.190 --> 00:27:26.190
We're not scientists. So we can't give you a definitive answer.

482
00:27:26.850 --> 00:27:31.140
We can say for sure was that it wasn't caused by the G five.

483
00:27:31.350 --> 00:27:33.420
