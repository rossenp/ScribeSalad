00:00:23.360 --> 00:00:26.710
Nancy wake was a beautiful, smart Australian woman living in France.

7
00:00:26.810 --> 00:00:27.790
And at first glanced,

8
00:00:27.791 --> 00:00:31.510
she looked like a housewife and no one would've suspected that she was actually

9
00:00:31.670 --> 00:00:34.710
a secret agents for the SOE during world war II.

10
00:00:34.730 --> 00:00:38.070
She was given the nickname of the white mouse because she continued to escape

11
00:00:38.071 --> 00:00:41.780
from the Nazis grasp. After becoming an in espionage,

12
00:00:41.781 --> 00:00:46.540
she was put on the guapos most wanted list and had a 5 million Frank bounty

13
00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:48.460
on her head in the video today,

14
00:00:48.461 --> 00:00:52.140
we're looking at the incredible story of Nancy wake, the white mouse.

15
00:00:58.210 --> 00:01:00.740
Luckily for us, Nancy wake wrote her own autobiography.

16
00:01:00.741 --> 00:01:04.770
So we know of information about her life and adventurous. First and foremost,

17
00:01:04.790 --> 00:01:08.610
she was born in Wellington New Zealand in 1912. At the age of two,

18
00:01:08.630 --> 00:01:11.370
her parents moved to Australia and she was raised in Sydney.

19
00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:15.250
Nancy was a very independent and free spirited girl. So at the age of 16,

20
00:01:15.350 --> 00:01:18.410
she ran away from home to work as a nurse. A few years later,

21
00:01:18.430 --> 00:01:20.330
she inherited 200 pounds from her aunts.

22
00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:23.240
Now this might not sound like a lot of money eat today, but back then,

23
00:01:23.241 --> 00:01:26.120
that was worth about the equivalent of 11,500 pounds.

24
00:01:26.230 --> 00:01:30.480
This gave her the financial freedom to travel and live her best life. As age 19,

25
00:01:30.580 --> 00:01:34.440
she hopped on a boat and landed in north America who experienced life in New

26
00:01:34.440 --> 00:01:37.160
York city. She just so happened to be there during prohibition.

27
00:01:37.180 --> 00:01:40.480
She said I had never consumed so much alcohol in my short life.

28
00:01:40.540 --> 00:01:45.070
People were making it in S after getting this partying out of our system,

29
00:01:45.071 --> 00:01:47.870
Nancy decided to move to London to take journalism classes.

30
00:01:47.940 --> 00:01:51.270
When she was 20 years old, she tried to get her first paid writing gig.

31
00:01:51.271 --> 00:01:54.230
And the hiring manager said that he was passionate about Egypt.

32
00:01:54.280 --> 00:01:58.350
Nancy really wanted the job. So she claims that she was into Egyptology as well.

33
00:01:58.530 --> 00:02:01.750
She had no idea how to actually read or write Arabic,

34
00:02:01.930 --> 00:02:04.420
but she began joting out scribbles on paper,

35
00:02:04.600 --> 00:02:07.820
and she handed it over to the man claiming to know the language.

36
00:02:08.220 --> 00:02:11.580
People actually believed her. And she got the job. This was deceptive,

37
00:02:11.581 --> 00:02:11.920
of course,

38
00:02:11.920 --> 00:02:16.180
but her ability to lie under pressure would become absolutely vital during her

39
00:02:16.460 --> 00:02:17.293
spike career.

40
00:02:22.750 --> 00:02:27.570
Eventually way moved to Paris, where she found work as a freelance journalist.

41
00:02:27.710 --> 00:02:28.430
In most cases,

42
00:02:28.430 --> 00:02:32.490
she would go looking for a great story to write about first and then a buyer

43
00:02:32.540 --> 00:02:34.250
later back in the 1930s,

44
00:02:34.251 --> 00:02:38.570
she could pay for six months of life for just selling one article because her

45
00:02:38.571 --> 00:02:41.810
small apartment was so cheap. The rest of her money was spent on clothes,

46
00:02:41.811 --> 00:02:45.520
jewelry, and travel and having a carefree life attending parties.

47
00:02:45.740 --> 00:02:48.120
During this time she learned to speak French fluently.

48
00:02:48.440 --> 00:02:51.520
Nancy would take writing assignments all over France and became familiar with

49
00:02:51.660 --> 00:02:54.520
all of the train and bus reads throughout the country. At the time,

50
00:02:54.580 --> 00:02:58.840
she would have no idea just how important and valuable this knowledge would be.

51
00:02:59.020 --> 00:03:03.040
But her familiarity with the French countryside would later save her life.

52
00:03:03.310 --> 00:03:07.040
Nancy's carefree lifestyle. It changed when she was on assignment in Vienna,

53
00:03:07.340 --> 00:03:11.320
in Austria. For the first time she witnessed the atrocities of the Nazi regime.

54
00:03:11.420 --> 00:03:12.140
She said.

55
00:03:12.140 --> 00:03:16.080
<v 2>In the middle of that beautiful city of a big wheel in the square,</v>

56
00:03:16.580 --> 00:03:18.360
and the Jews were tied to the,

57
00:03:19.290 --> 00:03:23.790
and a suspect would be them. I stood there and I thought,

58
00:03:24.630 --> 00:03:27.470
if ever, I can do something one day, I'll do it.

59
00:03:27.760 --> 00:03:31.750
<v 0>Nancy decided to live in Marai, France for a while in 1936.</v>

60
00:03:31.751 --> 00:03:34.390
And she began to explore the social scene on a nights.

61
00:03:34.590 --> 00:03:36.990
Now she always ran into a handsome man named Ari FIAR.

62
00:03:37.210 --> 00:03:40.700
She rides he'd always been with a different girl, sometimes three or four.

63
00:03:40.701 --> 00:03:42.500
The same day I used to be Popeye.

64
00:03:42.740 --> 00:03:44.980
Did it stamina one night honorary came on to her,

65
00:03:44.981 --> 00:03:48.260
but she did not take him seriously as a potential boyfriends. He was charming,

66
00:03:48.410 --> 00:03:51.940
sexy, and amusing, but I was too experienced at once. Anything from a Playboy.

67
00:03:52.040 --> 00:03:55.300
So they remained friends and she would congratulate him on his ability to find a

68
00:03:55.301 --> 00:03:58.500
new woman every evening, three years later, when Nancy was 27 years old,

69
00:03:58.520 --> 00:04:02.290
she returns a Mars and ran into Andre. Again, she finally gave him a chance.

70
00:04:02.470 --> 00:04:05.970
It only took them a few weeks to realize that they were perfect for one another.

71
00:04:06.250 --> 00:04:07.330
And Andre proposed to her.

72
00:04:07.390 --> 00:04:10.290
It turns out that he was the son of a wealthy industrialist,

73
00:04:10.310 --> 00:04:13.650
and she would soon be the wife of a millionaire in 1939.

74
00:04:13.850 --> 00:04:17.010
War was declared in France. When Nancy was on a train from Paris to London,

75
00:04:17.230 --> 00:04:20.800
she immediately went to the nearest recruiting office in London and offered her

76
00:04:20.801 --> 00:04:22.880
services to the war effort on behalf of great Britain.

77
00:04:22.970 --> 00:04:27.320
Nancy wanted to help so badly that she was willing to postpone her wedding to

78
00:04:27.680 --> 00:04:27.820
Enri,

79
00:04:27.820 --> 00:04:31.760
but the only job they could offer her was being a lunch lady in the canteen.

80
00:04:31.950 --> 00:04:34.480
This was not the sort of help that she had in mind.

81
00:04:34.540 --> 00:04:37.080
And she left the recruiting office a few months later,

82
00:04:37.250 --> 00:04:39.480
Nancy and Onri were married at first.

83
00:04:39.500 --> 00:04:41.790
She made the most of being a wife of a millionaire. She said,

84
00:04:42.050 --> 00:04:46.710
no woman could have been as useless or as frivolous as I was during those wins a

85
00:04:46.711 --> 00:04:48.470
months, but the desire to help the war effort,

86
00:04:48.750 --> 00:04:53.030
it still pulls on our heartstrings and she never let go of her deep seated

87
00:04:53.031 --> 00:04:54.750
hatred for the Nazis,

88
00:05:01.090 --> 00:05:04.340
Even though Nancy and aria were wealthy enough to avoid the war,

89
00:05:04.341 --> 00:05:07.380
if they chose to, they both wanted to do as much as they could to help.

90
00:05:07.440 --> 00:05:11.260
In 1940 Andre received his papers to fight on behalf of the French army.

91
00:05:11.390 --> 00:05:12.940
Since they had the financial means,

92
00:05:12.970 --> 00:05:16.660
they stocked up on food rations and helped to feed their friends and neighbors

93
00:05:16.661 --> 00:05:18.700
who did not have the foresight to prepare.

94
00:05:18.730 --> 00:05:22.450
They even purchased their own vehicles so that Nancy could volunteer as an

95
00:05:22.451 --> 00:05:26.170
ambulance driver. The fighting was shortlived and on June the 16th, 1940,

96
00:05:26.190 --> 00:05:28.490
the prime minister of France resigned. Six days later,

97
00:05:28.830 --> 00:05:32.770
an amist was signed by 1942, the Nazis they occupied all of France.

98
00:05:33.110 --> 00:05:36.290
Now you would think that everyone would want to fight for France's independence

99
00:05:36.291 --> 00:05:38.930
from the Nazis, but it was a bit more complicated than that.

100
00:05:38.931 --> 00:05:43.080
Germany put a man named Philippe PATAR in charges than knew Marshall of France.

101
00:05:43.300 --> 00:05:45.000
He had been a famous world war I hero,

102
00:05:45.060 --> 00:05:47.360
and many people still respected and looked up to him.

103
00:05:47.800 --> 00:05:50.680
Patan was telling the public to cooperate with Germany. Meanwhile,

104
00:05:50.681 --> 00:05:52.760
officer Shal took the opposite stance.

105
00:05:52.900 --> 00:05:54.920
He believed that the Nazis needed to be defeated,

106
00:05:54.980 --> 00:05:57.920
and he became in charge of a group of war veterans known as the French

107
00:05:57.921 --> 00:05:58.481
resistance.

108
00:05:58.481 --> 00:06:02.280
These people would attempt to destroy Nazi infrastructure and kill as many

109
00:06:02.281 --> 00:06:03.114
Germans as possible.

110
00:06:03.560 --> 00:06:06.440
Marshall Pitar claims that this resistance it needed to be stopped.

111
00:06:06.540 --> 00:06:10.040
And this led to the creation of a pro-Nazi paramilitary group called the Malise.

112
00:06:10.210 --> 00:06:14.520
These were French men who agreed with Nazi ideals. And by 1943,

113
00:06:14.800 --> 00:06:15.880
they had 25,000 members.

114
00:06:16.030 --> 00:06:20.070
Many of the Maise would work to infiltrate the French resistance of spies only

115
00:06:20.310 --> 00:06:23.070
to later then hand them over to the star. PO at first, Nancy,

116
00:06:23.320 --> 00:06:26.750
Andre were casually involving themselves in subversive activities like

117
00:06:26.751 --> 00:06:30.510
delivering secret messages or aging allied soldiers that they met in local

118
00:06:30.690 --> 00:06:33.910
hotels. Eventually they began working more and more with the French resistance.

119
00:06:34.080 --> 00:06:37.660
Nancy became a part of an escape network led by left tenant,

120
00:06:37.661 --> 00:06:41.900
Colonel Ian Garrow. At first, he only trusted her to deliver coded messages,

121
00:06:41.901 --> 00:06:44.060
but she was eager to get in on the action.

122
00:06:44.380 --> 00:06:48.060
A man named Patrick Eleri was leading people through an escape line that became

123
00:06:48.061 --> 00:06:49.500
known as the O'Leary line.

124
00:06:49.510 --> 00:06:52.980
Nancy provided a safe house for these soldiers and refugees before they were

125
00:06:52.981 --> 00:06:56.300
taken by a guide over the Peres mountains on the freedom trail.

126
00:06:56.520 --> 00:06:57.380
One day left tenant.

127
00:06:57.890 --> 00:07:01.570
Colonel Gary showed up to Nancy's home unannounced with a man that she had never

128
00:07:01.571 --> 00:07:05.490
met before the maids had let the men. And when Nancy opened the door to Paula,

129
00:07:05.710 --> 00:07:08.050
the mystery man forced her dog to leave the room.

130
00:07:08.160 --> 00:07:11.570
This man was Paul Cole and had already invited himself who opened the most

131
00:07:11.571 --> 00:07:14.970
expensive bottle of whiskey that she had been waiting to open with her husbands

132
00:07:14.971 --> 00:07:17.050
on victory day. Even during peace time,

133
00:07:17.290 --> 00:07:20.440
stealing a strangers whiskey and being rude to their dog is enough to get them

134
00:07:20.530 --> 00:07:22.520
bands for someone's house for life Nancy.

135
00:07:22.740 --> 00:07:27.080
She was rather understandably infuriated and immediately she got bad vibes from

136
00:07:27.081 --> 00:07:28.160
this poor coal guy.

137
00:07:28.480 --> 00:07:31.400
She ordered him to get out of her house immediately and never come back.

138
00:07:31.550 --> 00:07:32.560
This shocked the two men,

139
00:07:32.561 --> 00:07:35.880
because they did not expect such an outburst from a dainty woman later.

140
00:07:35.900 --> 00:07:39.590
She tried to warn Gary not to trust Cole because she believed that he was

141
00:07:39.790 --> 00:07:42.270
actually a spy for the Casta pad. Miss Nancy,

142
00:07:42.271 --> 00:07:45.390
saying that she was overreacting and being too secretive.

143
00:07:45.650 --> 00:07:48.710
She remained suspicious about col though and began to realize that Gary was

144
00:07:48.711 --> 00:07:50.390
using her as little more than a bank account.

145
00:07:50.610 --> 00:07:53.710
She and so had given the French resistance leaders, whatever they wanted,

146
00:07:54.060 --> 00:07:55.470
they were overstepping their boundaries.

147
00:07:55.680 --> 00:07:59.740
Nancy began spending less time around Gar and more time around P Patrick O. Lee,

148
00:07:59.790 --> 00:08:04.100
since she could actually help save more lives in a direct way by providing

149
00:08:04.530 --> 00:08:05.500
POWs with a safe house.

150
00:08:05.670 --> 00:08:09.740
Nancy also began to smuggle pamphlets in the shopping basket of her bicycle so

151
00:08:09.741 --> 00:08:12.700
that she could distribute resistance, newspapers and secret messages.

152
00:08:12.800 --> 00:08:13.740
The Nazi soldiers,

153
00:08:13.741 --> 00:08:17.380
they never suspected her because she just looked like every other housewife in

154
00:08:17.381 --> 00:08:18.080
the country.

155
00:08:18.080 --> 00:08:21.770
And she could speak fluent friend inch without a hint of her Australian accents.

156
00:08:21.860 --> 00:08:23.850
Since Nancy never revealed to Paul Cole,

157
00:08:23.851 --> 00:08:27.690
that she was a part of the Rey assumed that she was just a housewife.

158
00:08:27.950 --> 00:08:30.050
It turns out that her intuition was spot on.

159
00:08:30.051 --> 00:08:33.490
And Paul Cole truly was a gustapo agent. Soon after that meeting,

160
00:08:33.590 --> 00:08:38.330
he betrayed 50 members of the French resistance who were arrested tortured and

161
00:08:38.331 --> 00:08:39.210
ultimately killed.

162
00:08:39.640 --> 00:08:43.680
Even he even left tenant Colonel and Gary was caught and put in jail as well,

163
00:08:43.870 --> 00:08:45.000
instead of rubbing it here,

164
00:08:45.001 --> 00:08:48.000
Nancy and Don Rey tried to get him the best lawyer money could buy.

165
00:08:48.110 --> 00:08:50.240
When that fails. They helped to organize his escape.

166
00:08:50.390 --> 00:08:53.600
Nancy's friends managed to S SMU lane Nazi uniform into the prison.

167
00:08:53.740 --> 00:08:57.720
And Gary was able to get out in order to begin his journey on the freedom trail.

168
00:08:57.940 --> 00:08:59.920
So just before we get into Nancy's escape,

169
00:09:00.040 --> 00:09:03.800
I do want to recommend that after watching this video, you check out the series,

170
00:09:04.180 --> 00:09:06.160

195
00:10:20.161 --> 00:10:21.360
let's get back to today's video

196
00:10:27.660 --> 00:10:28.600
In 1942,

197
00:10:28.601 --> 00:10:33.400
Germany declared that they wanted 350,000 French men to move to Germany in order

198
00:10:33.420 --> 00:10:37.070
to work in their factories. No one in France was happy about this, of course,

199
00:10:37.071 --> 00:10:41.510
but Marshall Felipe PATAR was able to negotiate a deal that for every three men

200
00:10:41.530 --> 00:10:43.670
who went to work in Germany, willingly,

201
00:10:43.700 --> 00:10:46.030
they would release one French prisoner of war.

202
00:10:46.140 --> 00:10:49.190
This was enough incentive for 50,000 men to volunteer, to leave,

203
00:10:49.370 --> 00:10:53.670
but on everyone was willing to bow down to the Nazis groups of men and women who

204
00:10:53.671 --> 00:10:57.260
despised the Germans began to disappear into the forests and they call all

205
00:10:57.261 --> 00:10:58.620
themselves the Marqui.

206
00:10:58.750 --> 00:11:03.060
These pockets of Marqui fighters were a vital part of the French resistance.

207
00:11:03.130 --> 00:11:05.580
They worked to kill Nazis whenever they possibly could.

208
00:11:05.720 --> 00:11:09.660
The only issue was that they were not organized and had no way of communicating

209
00:11:09.661 --> 00:11:10.350
with one another.

210
00:11:10.350 --> 00:11:13.740
Eventually the Germans learned that there was a beautiful member of the French

211
00:11:13.750 --> 00:11:16.860
resistance who was managing to transport secret messages,

212
00:11:16.990 --> 00:11:20.090
break Ws out of jail and organized, safe houses.

213
00:11:20.430 --> 00:11:24.090
She was accomplishing so much and she continued to go undetected.

214
00:11:24.180 --> 00:11:28.450
Nancy had such strong intuition about people's character that she had face to

215
00:11:28.570 --> 00:11:31.730
face meetings with several gustapo spies, but was never caught.

216
00:11:31.960 --> 00:11:35.650
They called her the white mouse because she would always slip out of their hands

217
00:11:35.990 --> 00:11:37.850
in 1943, the white mouse,

218
00:11:38.260 --> 00:11:43.080
one of the Gustos most wanted and had a 5 million Frank bounty put on her head.

219
00:11:43.560 --> 00:11:45.680
She Andre knew that it was time for her to escape,

220
00:11:45.700 --> 00:11:48.440
but if they both left at the same time, it would look suspicious.

221
00:11:48.670 --> 00:11:51.920
Bony also wanted to stay at France because he found like he had a duty to his

222
00:11:51.921 --> 00:11:54.160
family's business. As she was preparing to leave.

223
00:11:54.161 --> 00:11:58.160
Nancy told Andre that if he was unfaithful and moved on with another woman,

224
00:11:58.300 --> 00:12:01.760
she would understand after all she had no idea when they'd see each other again,

225
00:12:01.900 --> 00:12:06.000
but she promised to wait for her Nancy escaping the country was not so

226
00:12:06.120 --> 00:12:07.240
straightforward for three months.

227
00:12:07.340 --> 00:12:09.840
She had to travel around the country on buses and trains,

228
00:12:09.841 --> 00:12:13.230
waiting for the perfect opportunity to cross the Peres mountain. Untacked it.

229
00:12:13.490 --> 00:12:17.390
She had to circle the country so many times she eventually ended up not far from

230
00:12:17.410 --> 00:12:20.390
her home in Marai. Nancy stood outside of her house,

231
00:12:20.391 --> 00:12:23.790
wishing so badly to go inside and see her husband one last time.

232
00:12:23.890 --> 00:12:26.510
But she knew it would be too dangerous for the both of them.

233
00:12:26.810 --> 00:12:28.950
And she chose to walk away. Unfortunately,

234
00:12:29.130 --> 00:12:32.310
all of her efforts were in vain because she was caught with false identification

235
00:12:32.370 --> 00:12:35.340
on one of these rains and the gustapo threw her in jail.

236
00:12:41.470 --> 00:12:44.980
While in custody, the gustapo began to beat and interrogate Nancy.

237
00:12:45.130 --> 00:12:48.620
They had no idea that they had captured the famous white mouse when they asked

238
00:12:48.900 --> 00:12:50.020
why identification was fake.

239
00:12:50.021 --> 00:12:53.460
She claimed she had left her husband to be with another man and wanted her fresh

240
00:12:53.660 --> 00:12:54.730
start with a new identity.

241
00:12:54.950 --> 00:12:58.170
The gustapo did not believe Erins claims that she must be responsible for

242
00:12:58.171 --> 00:12:59.450
setting off a bomb a few weeks early.

243
00:12:59.520 --> 00:13:03.490
They interrogated her for four days and she may have died if it was not for a

244
00:13:03.491 --> 00:13:07.010
friend Patrick O leery when Nancy never showed up to her Rone viewpoint,

245
00:13:07.610 --> 00:13:08.810
Eleri knew that she must have been captured.

246
00:13:08.950 --> 00:13:12.010
So he pretended to be this lover that she claimed to be running away with.

247
00:13:12.150 --> 00:13:15.560
The Nazis finally believed her cover story orient. She was able to leave.

248
00:13:15.561 --> 00:13:19.320
Patrick OER was finally able to get her on the freedom trail and she made her

249
00:13:19.321 --> 00:13:21.600
way to England. Once she arrived in the United Kingdom,

250
00:13:21.700 --> 00:13:25.320
she decided to join Winston Churchills group called the special operations

251
00:13:25.350 --> 00:13:29.760
executive or the SOE Churchill's goal was to gather all of the various factions

252
00:13:29.761 --> 00:13:34.040
of the French resistance marquee and have them come together to be one large

253
00:13:34.050 --> 00:13:34.790
organ,

254
00:13:34.790 --> 00:13:38.310
nice group D-Day was approaching and they needed help from the resistance to get

255
00:13:38.311 --> 00:13:39.750
France ready for the allied invasion.

256
00:13:40.000 --> 00:13:43.350
Nancy moved to Scotlands with a group of new recruits and they all began their

257
00:13:43.450 --> 00:13:46.190
spy training. The first stage was endurance.

258
00:13:46.220 --> 00:13:48.670
They were made to do exercises both day and night.

259
00:13:48.790 --> 00:13:50.990
A lot of people couldn't make it past that first stage.

260
00:13:51.290 --> 00:13:53.630
For those that were left, they were trained in combat silent,

261
00:13:53.631 --> 00:13:57.740
killing weaponry code, disabling a German tank, and a lot more,

262
00:13:57.970 --> 00:14:02.260
even though she had absolutely no experience in combat Nancy was determined to

263
00:14:02.261 --> 00:14:06.540
get stronger so that she would fight for the people of France and return home to

264
00:14:06.660 --> 00:14:07.110
her husband.

265
00:14:07.110 --> 00:14:10.940
Nancy was forced to practice karate chops on a wooden desk in order to harden

266
00:14:11.060 --> 00:14:11.600
her hands.

267
00:14:11.600 --> 00:14:15.020
Her instructors claims that ones swift chop in the neck was enough to kill a

268
00:14:15.100 --> 00:14:15.810
Nazi.

269
00:14:15.810 --> 00:14:19.570
That first she found this heart to believe until it actually happened during a

270
00:14:19.571 --> 00:14:22.730
fight. She chopped a Nazi in the Akins, then kicked him in the baby maker.

271
00:14:22.870 --> 00:14:24.890
The first time she did this to a German officer,

272
00:14:25.070 --> 00:14:27.290
she was shocked at how easily it killed him.

273
00:14:33.480 --> 00:14:35.770
Once her training was complete, it was time to,

274
00:14:36.360 --> 00:14:38.360
to France so that she could help organize the marque.

275
00:14:38.460 --> 00:14:42.120
She parachuted from a plane wearing camel hair coat and high heeled shoes.

276
00:14:42.390 --> 00:14:46.480
Once she landed, the marque were taken aback by the look of a posh housewife,

277
00:14:46.481 --> 00:14:49.360
descending from the sky. This was all part of her disguise. Of course,

278
00:14:49.361 --> 00:14:53.240
since being underestimated as a harmless housewife was part of her cover.

279
00:14:53.350 --> 00:14:55.000
Even though she was the famous white mouse,

280
00:14:55.020 --> 00:14:58.640
her beautiful and fashionable appearance did not leave the marque with a lot of

281
00:14:58.641 --> 00:15:02.240
confidence that a woman could do the job just as the Nazis thought,

282
00:15:02.241 --> 00:15:03.520
they thought she must be useless.

283
00:15:03.521 --> 00:15:06.720
And they were not impressed that the British had sent such a da woman to help

284
00:15:06.721 --> 00:15:10.240
them. It was her job to convince these strangers to work with the SOE.

285
00:15:10.730 --> 00:15:14.350
She promised that the British would send supplies and it took several days for a

286
00:15:14.351 --> 00:15:17.870
radio operator dentist to also arrive. Finally, the supplies came through.

287
00:15:18.050 --> 00:15:20.030
Not only did they get the standard munitions,

288
00:15:20.031 --> 00:15:24.990
but the SOE sent Nancy her special requests, new silk stockings, makeup, tea,

289
00:15:25.130 --> 00:15:27.710
and bottles of expensive whiskey. In order to break the ice.

290
00:15:27.770 --> 00:15:31.460
She challenged the men in the marque to a drinking contest through whoever was

291
00:15:31.461 --> 00:15:33.420
still standing at Dawn one. After this,

292
00:15:33.480 --> 00:15:37.620
the members of the resistance license UPNs they knew that they could trust her.

293
00:15:37.760 --> 00:15:39.820
Of course, she got a lot of attention while living in the forest,

294
00:15:40.140 --> 00:15:43.180
since she was an attractive young woman among a bunch of dudes, years later,

295
00:15:43.200 --> 00:15:46.380
one of her biographers asked if she ever had a lover while she was living with

296
00:15:46.381 --> 00:15:49.700
the Marqui. She rolled her eyes saying if I had accommodated one of them,

297
00:15:50.020 --> 00:15:52.570
I would've had to accommodate of them. In reality,

298
00:15:52.571 --> 00:15:54.050
while she may have been a huge flirt,

299
00:15:54.070 --> 00:15:57.770
she was always faithful to her husband on re one night.

300
00:15:57.770 --> 00:16:01.450
Nancy had a nightmare that on re had been killed by the Nazis and a firing

301
00:16:01.690 --> 00:16:01.870
squat.

302
00:16:01.870 --> 00:16:06.010
She woke up in a cold sweat and hoped that it was just dream for once she wanted

303
00:16:06.110 --> 00:16:09.570
her strong intuition to be wrong. As DJ approached the radio operator,

304
00:16:09.571 --> 00:16:12.920
Dennis got himself caught up in the crossfire of the Mark Key in the Nazis.

305
00:16:13.100 --> 00:16:15.880
He believed that he may be captured. So he destroyed the radio.

306
00:16:15.970 --> 00:16:17.560
Thankfully he made it out alive,

307
00:16:17.561 --> 00:16:21.320
but now the resistance members were left stranded without any way to communicate

308
00:16:21.321 --> 00:16:24.320
with the British to get help. If they could not communicate with the allies,

309
00:16:24.640 --> 00:16:26.320
thousands of men were going to die.

310
00:16:26.380 --> 00:16:29.760
The nearest SOE radio was over 200 kilometers away at a shadow,

311
00:16:29.900 --> 00:16:33.030
and they would never be able to drive a car there without in court,

312
00:16:33.270 --> 00:16:37.270
a checkpoint. So Nancy wake offered to ride her bicycle over the next few days,

313
00:16:37.410 --> 00:16:41.230
she rode her bike occasionally stopping to refresh her makeup so that she looked

314
00:16:41.231 --> 00:16:42.270
like a pamper housewife.

315
00:16:42.670 --> 00:16:45.830
Like Alicia remembered the roads from her time taking so many buses and trains

316
00:16:45.950 --> 00:16:48.390
as journalists. So at least she knew where she was going.

317
00:16:48.520 --> 00:16:50.310
Every time she reached a Nazi checkpoint,

318
00:16:50.330 --> 00:16:52.910
she would smile and flirt with the guards. One of her ghost,

319
00:16:53.260 --> 00:16:57.220
you lines was hello, officer, would you like to search me? It worked every time.

320
00:16:57.450 --> 00:16:58.580
Once she reached the shadow,

321
00:16:58.800 --> 00:17:02.500
she told them that she was the white mouse and she needed to contact the British

322
00:17:02.530 --> 00:17:06.420
immediately. Once the SOE knew of their location, she had to make her way back,

323
00:17:06.421 --> 00:17:10.220
immediately pedaling. Another 200 kilometers later in life.

324
00:17:10.221 --> 00:17:13.420
Nancy said that the bike ride was the most frightening thing she had ever done,

325
00:17:13.670 --> 00:17:16.090
but it was also the proudest because of this.

326
00:17:16.150 --> 00:17:19.170
The marque were able to get another radio center them and she,

327
00:17:19.171 --> 00:17:22.810
and the other resistance fighters continued to kill Nazis without any

328
00:17:22.811 --> 00:17:27.730
hesitation. She said, if you ask me the only good Nazi is a dead one,

329
00:17:32.390 --> 00:17:33.530
The war was finally over.

330
00:17:33.670 --> 00:17:37.520
And the is one Nancy was recognized for a bravery and was awarded the us medal

331
00:17:37.521 --> 00:17:38.060
of freedom.

332
00:17:38.060 --> 00:17:41.720
The George medal from the UK and the badge of gold from New Zealand and the

333
00:17:41.721 --> 00:17:43.680
order of Australia. If it went off for her work,

334
00:17:43.681 --> 00:17:45.680
organizing the marque and securing that radio,

335
00:17:46.160 --> 00:17:48.720
thousands of people would've died in the forest. Unfortunately,

336
00:17:48.860 --> 00:17:50.720
by choosing to save thousands of men,

337
00:17:50.860 --> 00:17:55.360
she had to sacrifice the one that had meant the most to her Andre had remained

338
00:17:55.560 --> 00:17:57.400
faithful to her and was awaiting her return.

339
00:17:57.401 --> 00:18:00.880
But the gustapo had raided their home and arrested him under suspicion of being

340
00:18:00.881 --> 00:18:02.040
the husband of the white mouse.

341
00:18:02.150 --> 00:18:05.920
They tortured him and eventually they offered him his freedom and exchange for

342
00:18:05.921 --> 00:18:10.390
confirmation that Nancy was the white mouse refused to betray his wife and he

343
00:18:10.391 --> 00:18:11.790
was killed by firing squat.

344
00:18:11.930 --> 00:18:15.590
The day he died was the same day that Nancy had the nightmare about his death.

345
00:18:15.950 --> 00:18:16.271
That connection.

346
00:18:16.271 --> 00:18:20.110
It was so strong that she somehow knew when the love of her life had been

347
00:18:20.111 --> 00:18:22.190
killed. Now that she had nothing left her in France,

348
00:18:22.191 --> 00:18:24.590
Nancy moved to London and joined the M ministry.

349
00:18:24.591 --> 00:18:28.270
Nancy wake carried the guilt and sorrow over the death of her husband for the

350
00:18:28.271 --> 00:18:29.104
rest of her life.

351
00:18:29.460 --> 00:18:32.420
Nancy would go on to move to Australia and get married a second time to a man

352
00:18:32.421 --> 00:18:36.020
named John fors, but she still kept a photo of honorary next to her bet.

353
00:18:36.340 --> 00:18:39.820
When asked if she had any regrets, she replied, I killed a lot of Germans.

354
00:18:40.400 --> 00:18:43.780
I'm sorry. I didn't kill more. As she grew older, she was still not happy,

355
00:18:43.781 --> 00:18:45.900
especially after becoming widowed for a second time.

356
00:18:46.160 --> 00:18:49.890
She decided to sell her war medals at auction and used that money for her

357
00:18:49.891 --> 00:18:53.610
retirement. Since she continued to be restless, she longed to be back in Europe.

358
00:18:53.620 --> 00:18:57.090
Again at the age of 88, Nancy decided it was time for a fresh start.

359
00:18:57.110 --> 00:19:00.010
So she moved to the staff at hotel in London.

360
00:19:00.200 --> 00:19:03.970
When the concierge asked how long she would be staying, she said until I die,

361
00:19:04.220 --> 00:19:06.610
hotel employees absolutely loved having her there.

362
00:19:06.750 --> 00:19:09.930
The staff even had a special chair made for her at the hotel bar complete with

363
00:19:09.970 --> 00:19:11.800
the plaque that said Nancy's corner.

364
00:19:11.910 --> 00:19:15.320
They also painted a tiny white mouse on the ceiling of the hotel in Iran.

365
00:19:15.350 --> 00:19:18.000
When guests heard that the famous Nancy wake was staying there,

366
00:19:18.001 --> 00:19:20.920
they would often stop by to speak to her at the bar because of this.

367
00:19:20.940 --> 00:19:23.120
She was never alone and continued to socialize,

368
00:19:23.121 --> 00:19:24.760
which was the thing that she loved most.

369
00:19:24.761 --> 00:19:28.240
Eventually Nancy ran out of money from her retirement fund and she could no

370
00:19:28.241 --> 00:19:31.350
longer pay the steep price tag of living luxury hotel.

371
00:19:31.380 --> 00:19:32.870
When the prince of Wales heard about this,

372
00:19:33.110 --> 00:19:34.990
he invited her to Buckingham palace for tea.

373
00:19:35.130 --> 00:19:38.430
He paid for her bill and continued to do so for the rest of her life.

374
00:19:38.610 --> 00:19:41.950
She passed away in 2011 when she was 98 years old.

375
00:19:42.330 --> 00:19:43.990
