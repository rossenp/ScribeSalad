the market.

11
00:00:28.170 --> 00:00:31.390
<v 2>Now, you guys know I'm not exactly a fitness YouTuber.</v>

12
00:00:31.950 --> 00:00:33.310
I'm not exactly a fitness person,

13
00:00:33.990 --> 00:00:35.790
probably not coming to my channel for squat tips,

14
00:00:35.930 --> 00:00:39.910
but I do like to still eat right and take care of myself and pathetic greens is

15
00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:43.260
that comprehensive nutritional supplements that I know is going to account from

16
00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:48.140
the holes that are blatantly in my diet, because I know it's not super balanced.

17
00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:51.540
<v 0>Just one scoop into the water bottle in the morning. It even comes,</v>

18
00:00:51.541 --> 00:00:54.860
it comes with all of this stuff. You got the water bottle, you got the scooper.

19
00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:56.980
You don't take it out of the packet, like a Savage.

20
00:00:56.981 --> 00:01:00.980
They even provide this nice little tint to put it all in, keep it in the fridge.

21
00:01:01.420 --> 00:01:03.850
Plus it's gluten free, dairy free paleo vegan, keto,

22
00:01:04.070 --> 00:01:07.970
low allergen and low calorie. There's less than one gram of sugar per serving,

23
00:01:08.190 --> 00:01:10.770
but despite that it does taste sweet and good.

24
00:01:10.870 --> 00:01:13.450
One of the things that I like about it is I,

25
00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:17.170
I still drink my coffee in the morning, but I have a cup of this along with it.

26
00:01:17.350 --> 00:01:19.970
And it just makes me feel like I'm being more healthy.

27
00:01:20.110 --> 00:01:23.080
And I also feel like the kind of energy from the coffee lasts longer.

28
00:01:23.500 --> 00:01:26.000
<v 2>No idea if that's just in my head, but it's absolutely working.</v>

29
00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:28.680
Athletic greens is the perfect dietary supplement regimen.

00:01:28.980 --> 00:01:30.880

35
00:01:45.470 --> 00:01:46.303
And now today's video.

36
00:01:52.530 --> 00:01:53.710
<v 0>The Americans wanted him dead.</v>

37
00:01:53.970 --> 00:01:57.070
The Mexicans wanted him dead stuck in the middle between two larger,

38
00:01:57.260 --> 00:01:58.510
much more powerful forces,

39
00:01:59.010 --> 00:02:02.590
Apache warrior AMO strive to preserve his people's way of life.

40
00:02:02.650 --> 00:02:07.420
He did this the only way he knew how by fighting make no mistake

41
00:02:07.421 --> 00:02:11.580
about it. Despite the image everybody has of DRMO as this old calm and wise,

42
00:02:11.720 --> 00:02:12.200
man,

43
00:02:12.200 --> 00:02:16.780
he spent most of his life fighting and killing those who got in the way of his

44
00:02:16.781 --> 00:02:17.614
band of APA.

45
00:02:17.720 --> 00:02:21.100
He wasn't the kind of tribal chief to advocate for peaceful solutions. In fact,

46
00:02:21.270 --> 00:02:25.690
Dromo was never a tribal at all. He was a medicine man and a warrior,

47
00:02:26.130 --> 00:02:28.090
but people gravitated towards him. Nonetheless,

48
00:02:28.230 --> 00:02:32.730
he was a natural born leader who guided his people through the Apache wars,

49
00:02:32.830 --> 00:02:35.890
the most violent and turbulent time in their history.

50
00:02:41.170 --> 00:02:45.160
The most commonly accepted information says that Toronto was born on June the

51
00:02:45.161 --> 00:02:50.000
16th, 1829 in Turkey Creek, Arizona, somewhere near the Giller river.

52
00:02:50.220 --> 00:02:51.760
He belonged to the bed on koge bands.

53
00:02:51.761 --> 00:02:56.120
One of the smallest groups of the chiqua Apache, his birth name was GAAS,

54
00:02:56.410 --> 00:03:00.880
which meant one who Yorns. He adopted the Spanish named Geronimo later in life,

55
00:03:01.040 --> 00:03:04.600
although we're not exactly sure why we all go with the most popular and most

56
00:03:04.860 --> 00:03:05.693
badass reason,

57
00:03:05.850 --> 00:03:09.320
which said that he was such a fierce and fight to the many Mexican soldiers

58
00:03:09.321 --> 00:03:13.160
began praying to some drone when they faced him in battle theba warrior,

59
00:03:13.270 --> 00:03:18.200
like the way that sounded and accepted it as his new name Dromo was a man

60
00:03:18.710 --> 00:03:19.330
born into conflict.

61
00:03:19.330 --> 00:03:21.830
The Apache had been waring with the Spanish for hundreds of years,

62
00:03:21.890 --> 00:03:23.790
and the violence continued with the Mexicans.

63
00:03:23.791 --> 00:03:27.110
Once they gained their independence in 1821, there's a new state.

64
00:03:27.110 --> 00:03:29.110
Mexico was eager to establish its territory.

65
00:03:29.111 --> 00:03:32.870
So it lay claims the land where the B had settled. As you might imagine,

66
00:03:32.970 --> 00:03:37.190
the Apache disagreed with their claim and with no peaceful solution in sight.

67
00:03:37.290 --> 00:03:40.500
The only remaining option was war. When Jeronimo was young,

68
00:03:40.501 --> 00:03:44.820
the Apache chief who served as the biggest thorn in Mexico side was named

69
00:03:45.390 --> 00:03:49.140
Manus Colorados. As soon as Geronimo reached fighting age,

70
00:03:49.141 --> 00:03:53.380
he started joining the Apache gangs on raids against Mexicans led by Manus,

71
00:03:53.620 --> 00:03:56.540
sent his more famous son-in-law Kachie decades. Later.

72
00:03:56.590 --> 00:04:00.930
Manus Colorados meant as a very gruesome and shameful one that even germo called

73
00:04:01.190 --> 00:04:03.090
the greatest wrong ever done to the Indians,

74
00:04:03.190 --> 00:04:06.690
but it did not happen at the hands of the Mexicans or rival tribes,

75
00:04:07.030 --> 00:04:11.970
but rather the Americans in 1863 color was taken into custody by the union

76
00:04:12.080 --> 00:04:14.610
army. After meeting under a flag of TRUS bad night,

77
00:04:14.630 --> 00:04:16.410
the general in charge future Louisiana,

78
00:04:16.411 --> 00:04:19.970
Senator Joseph Rodman west told his centuries that he had no,

79
00:04:20.040 --> 00:04:23.600
no intention of negotiating. And he wanted the Apache chief dead by morning.

80
00:04:23.740 --> 00:04:27.840
The soldiers first tortured the imprisoned 70 year old color artist with heated

81
00:04:27.910 --> 00:04:28.721
bare nets.

82
00:04:28.721 --> 00:04:32.040
And then they shot him to death and buried him in a shallow grave later,

83
00:04:32.080 --> 00:04:34.840
claiming that he tried to escape the next day.

84
00:04:34.841 --> 00:04:38.160
They concluded that they could stoop even lower if they really tried hard

85
00:04:38.161 --> 00:04:41.070
enough. So they dug up the body cut off the boiled,

86
00:04:41.071 --> 00:04:44.190
the flesh off and sent the skull to a phenologist in New York,

87
00:04:44.380 --> 00:04:46.550
despite S from his descendants and historians.

88
00:04:46.551 --> 00:04:50.510
The current location of the skull remains a mystery and a nice friendly reminder

89
00:04:50.570 --> 00:04:53.990
of the American government's treatment of native Americans. Of course,

90
00:04:54.130 --> 00:04:55.630
all of this happens later,

91
00:04:55.810 --> 00:04:59.910
but young Romo also learns pretty quickly not to put too much stock in

92
00:04:59.911 --> 00:05:02.180
government promises. During the mid 1850s,

93
00:05:02.181 --> 00:05:06.260
there was a tenuous piece between the Apache tribes and the nearby Mexican towns

94
00:05:06.261 --> 00:05:09.980
after decades of violence that left many dead on both sides. By that point,

95
00:05:10.420 --> 00:05:11.780
Geronimo had officially become an Apache warrior.

96
00:05:11.960 --> 00:05:16.780
He had married a woman named lo and they had three children together in March,

97
00:05:16.780 --> 00:05:16.781
1858.

98
00:05:16.781 --> 00:05:20.380
Most of the men in Geronimo's bands left on a trading mission to a town that

99
00:05:20.381 --> 00:05:24.730
they called CA better known as Jan in the state of Chihuahua.

100
00:05:24.820 --> 00:05:25.970
While the warriors were gone,

101
00:05:25.990 --> 00:05:29.170
the Mexican army mounted a surprise attack act on the BCA ban,

102
00:05:29.410 --> 00:05:32.410
stealing all of their supplies and sling almost everyone that they encountered

103
00:05:32.710 --> 00:05:36.730
in his memoirs tarami recall the horrors that waited him when he arrived home

104
00:05:37.040 --> 00:05:39.090
late one afternoon, when returning from town,

105
00:05:39.110 --> 00:05:43.520
we were met by a few women in children who told us that Mexican troops from some

106
00:05:43.521 --> 00:05:46.520
other town that attacked our camp, killed all the warriors of the guard,

107
00:05:46.600 --> 00:05:48.480
captured all our ponies secured.

108
00:05:48.481 --> 00:05:51.760
Our arms destroyed our supplies and killed many of our women and children

109
00:05:51.761 --> 00:05:55.880
quickly. We separated concealing ourselves as best we could until nightfall.

110
00:05:55.990 --> 00:05:59.960
When we assembled at our appointed place of Rone who were thicker by the river

111
00:06:00.240 --> 00:06:03.400
silently, we stole in one by one sentinels were placed.

112
00:06:03.420 --> 00:06:05.880
And when all were counted, I found that my aged mother,

113
00:06:06.060 --> 00:06:09.600
my young wife and my three small children were among the slain

114
00:06:14.630 --> 00:06:17.990
Following the murder of his entire Adrian Geronimo was left with a burning

115
00:06:17.991 --> 00:06:22.150
hatred for Mexicans and an urge for revenge that haunted him for most of his

116
00:06:22.151 --> 00:06:23.790
life, going by Apache stories,

117
00:06:24.350 --> 00:06:27.910
Geronimo received divine protection to assure him that his quest for vengeance

118
00:06:28.050 --> 00:06:31.790
was righteous. After he had set fire to his family, his belongings,

119
00:06:31.791 --> 00:06:33.990
he went alone into the forest to mourn their loss.

120
00:06:34.470 --> 00:06:36.830
Very heard another worldly voice, the promised to guard him.

121
00:06:36.950 --> 00:06:38.820
So no gun will ever kill you.

122
00:06:39.140 --> 00:06:41.940
I will take the bullets from the guns of the Mexicans,

123
00:06:42.360 --> 00:06:46.900
and I will guide your arrows whether real or not the spectral voice kept up.

124
00:06:46.920 --> 00:06:49.260
Its end of the bargain. Geronimo was shot many times,

125
00:06:49.400 --> 00:06:51.500
but no gun ever killed him. On least one occasion.

126
00:06:51.560 --> 00:06:55.060
The Apache warrior ran out of arrows while fighting Mexican soldiers.

127
00:06:55.061 --> 00:06:58.370
So he just charged them with fire and fury ordering in his eyes,

128
00:06:58.580 --> 00:07:02.850
zigzagging his way through the hail of bullets and killing them all up close

129
00:07:02.851 --> 00:07:05.610
with his knife. Let's not sugar coat. This Droman,

130
00:07:05.611 --> 00:07:07.170
his band of warriors killed a lot,

131
00:07:07.530 --> 00:07:11.370
a lot of people and not all of them were soldiers armed and ready for a fight.

132
00:07:12.010 --> 00:07:15.970
Here's the how just one of Romos raids went in a summer of 1866 as tall by the

133
00:07:15.971 --> 00:07:19.600
man himself. I took 30 mounted warriors as an invaded Mexican territory.

134
00:07:19.660 --> 00:07:21.400
We went south through chihuahuas,

135
00:07:21.920 --> 00:07:25.720
far cent Cruz Sonora then crossed over the Sierra mare mountains,

136
00:07:25.721 --> 00:07:28.480
following the river course at the south end of the range,

137
00:07:28.660 --> 00:07:33.160
we kept on Westwood from the Sierra mare mountains to the Sierra to SA repay

138
00:07:33.320 --> 00:07:36.840
mountains and followed that range. Northwood. We collected all the horses,

139
00:07:37.090 --> 00:07:40.950
mules and cattle we wanted and drove the Northwood through Sonora into Arizona.

140
00:07:41.190 --> 00:07:43.710
Mexicans saw us many times and in many places,

141
00:07:43.890 --> 00:07:47.430
but they could not attack us at any time nor did any troops attempt to follow

142
00:07:47.431 --> 00:07:51.190
us. When we arrived at homes, we gave presents to all and the tribe,

143
00:07:51.220 --> 00:07:54.830
feasted and danced during this raid, we had killed about 50 Mexicans.

144
00:07:55.180 --> 00:07:58.470
This is how things went for the next 15 years or so.

145
00:07:58.471 --> 00:08:02.060
The Mexican killed the Apache and the Apache killed the Mexicans in return.

146
00:08:02.250 --> 00:08:06.820
They were trapped in a vicious cycle of death where each side felt justified in

147
00:08:06.940 --> 00:08:07.461
striking the other,

148
00:08:07.461 --> 00:08:11.180
either as revenge for a previous attack or to stop a new one.

149
00:08:11.190 --> 00:08:14.100
There was an attempt at reconciliation in 1873,

150
00:08:14.120 --> 00:08:17.660
the Apache and the Mexicans matters casts grander in OA,

151
00:08:17.840 --> 00:08:21.490
sat down together and agreed to a treaty just for a little moment.

152
00:08:21.590 --> 00:08:25.050
It looks like it might be possible to end the violence between the two sides,

153
00:08:25.310 --> 00:08:28.930
but in the IOR words of Admiral ABA, it's a truck.

154
00:08:29.280 --> 00:08:30.530
Once the treaty had been signed,

155
00:08:30.531 --> 00:08:34.330
the Mexicans brought out the Mascal to celebrate, not once turned down booze,

156
00:08:34.350 --> 00:08:38.090
the cherry KA choir got nice and drunk. And when they were all wasted,

157
00:08:38.091 --> 00:08:40.480
two companies of Mexican soldiers of the town,

158
00:08:40.520 --> 00:08:43.600
a Massa at the Toronto was among the lucky ones. He managed to escape,

159
00:08:43.660 --> 00:08:48.520
but it left his band of APA severely weakened and put an end to the raids for

160
00:08:48.521 --> 00:08:50.600
the time being. And if that wasn't bad enough,

161
00:08:50.601 --> 00:08:53.640
he also had to contend with a new threat. From the other side,

162
00:08:58.940 --> 00:09:00.200
During Toronto Mo's time,

163
00:09:00.201 --> 00:09:03.960
the Don COA people usually divided their time between the territories of Arizona

164
00:09:03.961 --> 00:09:07.760
and New Mexico with occasional incursions into the Northern Mexican states to

165
00:09:07.761 --> 00:09:11.440
conduct raid. At first, this was all land, the Mexico laid claim over,

166
00:09:11.500 --> 00:09:14.990
but the landscape changed drastically during the late 1840s.

167
00:09:14.991 --> 00:09:16.550
Thanks to the Mexican American war.

168
00:09:16.910 --> 00:09:18.910
After a decisive victory for the United States,

169
00:09:18.930 --> 00:09:23.750
the two countries signed the treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo in 1848.

170
00:09:23.751 --> 00:09:28.390
According to which Mexico not only recognized Texas as belonging to the United

171
00:09:28.390 --> 00:09:28.391
States of America,

172
00:09:28.391 --> 00:09:33.190
but also seeded a gigantic stretch of lands that makes up most of

173
00:09:33.191 --> 00:09:36.660
today's American Southwest. This is included the lands of the Apache ands,

174
00:09:36.661 --> 00:09:40.780
many other native Americans and with the California gold Russian full swing by

175
00:09:40.781 --> 00:09:43.580
the 1850s, the two sides were soon at odds with each other.

176
00:09:43.880 --> 00:09:45.260
As they fought over territory.

177
00:09:45.340 --> 00:09:49.460
Surprisingly drama was not among the first to take on the American army instead

178
00:09:49.461 --> 00:09:51.420
throughout the 1850s and 1860s.

179
00:09:51.420 --> 00:09:56.170
Other Apache leaders such as Manus color and CCHI were the

180
00:09:56.171 --> 00:09:58.530
ones who resisted American encroachments.

181
00:09:58.700 --> 00:10:01.410
We've already mentioned how that ended for Colorados, but Katrice,

182
00:10:01.570 --> 00:10:06.050
someone managed to avoid a similar grizzly fate after over a decade of fighting

183
00:10:06.110 --> 00:10:10.330
the us army tooth and nearly signed a peace treaty in 1872 and lived his last

184
00:10:10.730 --> 00:10:15.410
year's quietly dying of natural causes in 1874 during the mid 1870s,

185
00:10:15.411 --> 00:10:16.440
the government's that up,

186
00:10:16.500 --> 00:10:21.200
the San Carlos reservation in Arizona room wanted to move all the chiqua

187
00:10:21.540 --> 00:10:23.040
Apache there, as you might imagine,

188
00:10:23.050 --> 00:10:26.920
being confined to such a single area was an a many native Americans who were

189
00:10:26.990 --> 00:10:29.120
used to roaming the lands completely free.

190
00:10:29.350 --> 00:10:32.240
It's not like the reservation was particularly nice either.

191
00:10:32.250 --> 00:10:36.480
There was an arid waste land where food shortages and disease were rampant to

192
00:10:36.680 --> 00:10:41.550
truly deserving of the nickname that it earns Hells 40 acres in

193
00:10:41.590 --> 00:10:43.950
a shocking twist that nobody could have seen coming.

194
00:10:44.020 --> 00:10:47.470
Many Apache refused to go along with this plan and immediately rebelled against

195
00:10:47.471 --> 00:10:49.670
the us government preferring delivers Outlaws.

196
00:10:49.790 --> 00:10:52.070
If it meant keeping the Noma way of life. At this point,

197
00:10:52.080 --> 00:10:55.510
there were three men that de Turko are Apache turned to for guidance.

198
00:10:55.850 --> 00:10:56.830
One was DRMO who,

199
00:10:57.300 --> 00:11:01.180
although not a tribal chief had earned enough respect that his word carried a

200
00:11:01.181 --> 00:11:05.260
lot of weight. The other two were actual chiefs and the names were J and TA.

201
00:11:05.560 --> 00:11:09.220
The latter of these was the eldest son of Kachie and of the three.

202
00:11:09.240 --> 00:11:12.260
He was the one most willing to try and adapt to a new lifestyle.

203
00:11:12.520 --> 00:11:16.540
If it meant peace for his people, he traveled to the San Carlos reservation,

204
00:11:16.541 --> 00:11:20.690
willingly taking will them about a third of the Chiha afterward.

205
00:11:20.810 --> 00:11:22.930
He even went on a delegation to Washington DC,

206
00:11:23.060 --> 00:11:25.450
where he quickly felt ill with pneumonia and died.

207
00:11:25.550 --> 00:11:30.130
So not exactly an auspicious sign for the Apache American relationship,

208
00:11:30.131 --> 00:11:33.850
especially since rumors started flying that TA had actually been poisoned.

209
00:11:39.140 --> 00:11:41.600
As far as J Ando were concerned,

210
00:11:41.601 --> 00:11:44.960
they took the rest of the chia and made their way to New Mexico,

211
00:11:45.270 --> 00:11:49.880
unbeknownst Tomo. He had just made a new mortal enemy. John Clem,

212
00:11:50.180 --> 00:11:53.800
not that it made much difference to you JMO to have one extra man who wanted him

213
00:11:53.890 --> 00:11:56.480
deads, but well, who was John Clemons?

214
00:11:56.500 --> 00:11:59.640
Why did he have it in for the B donkey warrior? Well,

215
00:12:00.080 --> 00:12:03.880
Clem was the Indian agent who negotiated the deal to relocate the Apache to the

216
00:12:04.080 --> 00:12:07.760
San Carlos reservation. Initially both J and Taza were willing to move,

217
00:12:07.900 --> 00:12:10.360
but then Jeronimo came along and talk to J out of it.

218
00:12:10.500 --> 00:12:14.830
If Clem would've managed to get all the Chi art to settle in the reservation

219
00:12:14.831 --> 00:12:15.490
peacefully,

220
00:12:15.490 --> 00:12:19.270
it would've been a major boon for his career and he would've gotten away with it

221
00:12:19.290 --> 00:12:21.990
too, if it wasn't for that pesky Romo. Anyway,

222
00:12:22.090 --> 00:12:26.630
now Clem's plan went to hell and he wanted the Apache warrior dead as a

223
00:12:27.230 --> 00:12:29.950
consolation prize. It wasn't hard for him to track Romo down,

224
00:12:29.951 --> 00:12:33.620
especially after he got a few Apache Scouts to rat him out Jerone.

225
00:12:33.621 --> 00:12:38.540
The rest of the Chiha were on the O Callen reservation living alongside the warm

226
00:12:38.570 --> 00:12:40.820
Springs. Apache led by chief Victoria,

227
00:12:41.130 --> 00:12:45.020
Clem set up a trap that the unsuspecting JMO who had no idea he was being

228
00:12:45.050 --> 00:12:48.140
pursued and managed to capture him alive without the need for violence,

229
00:12:48.440 --> 00:12:51.860
likely to Clems disappointment. Since he would've appreciated it.

230
00:12:51.861 --> 00:12:55.970
If the Benko leader had had given him a reason to strike him down right then and

231
00:12:55.971 --> 00:12:56.710
there, well,

232
00:12:56.710 --> 00:13:00.570
he didn't and Jeronimo was brought in shackles to the San Carlos reservation

233
00:13:00.620 --> 00:13:04.170
where Clems dissatisfaction continued undoubtedly.

234
00:13:04.171 --> 00:13:07.370
He was hoping for a speedy execution for the Apache re,

235
00:13:07.590 --> 00:13:11.970
but he didn't get one maybe for the first time ever bureaucracy saved the day

236
00:13:12.520 --> 00:13:16.040
ASMO sentence was delayed of the department of war and the bureau of Indian

237
00:13:16.041 --> 00:13:20.280
affairs bickered over who had jurisdiction over the Chi Kawa.

238
00:13:20.330 --> 00:13:21.200
After a few days,

239
00:13:21.440 --> 00:13:24.240
drawn saw an opportunity to escape and de took it as it turned out.

240
00:13:24.640 --> 00:13:27.400
Clem didn't hate him enough to go through all of that again. So inster,

241
00:13:27.600 --> 00:13:29.440
he simply resigned from his post.

242
00:13:29.700 --> 00:13:33.920
The early 1880s were very violent and active period for the Apache one that

243
00:13:34.160 --> 00:13:37.990
helped seal reputation is one of the most dangerous native American nations in

244
00:13:37.991 --> 00:13:39.910
the United States on Theran from the law.

245
00:13:40.230 --> 00:13:43.790
Many Chi crossed the border into Mexico and hid out in the Sierra Madre

246
00:13:43.910 --> 00:13:48.350
mountains. Their Dromo was joined by other famed warriors, such as J chief.

247
00:13:49.070 --> 00:13:50.830
NNS the ironically named ban.

248
00:13:50.940 --> 00:13:55.540
They often led raids along the border ranches wagon, trains, men, URS,

249
00:13:55.780 --> 00:13:59.420
prospectors, the Apache attacked them all without mercy or hesitation,

250
00:13:59.640 --> 00:14:03.260
and usually left no survivors to prevent their location from being discovered

251
00:14:03.370 --> 00:14:06.420
even. So the Chi choir couldn't remain hidden forever.

252
00:14:06.480 --> 00:14:08.580
And as the trail of bodies, they left in their wake,

253
00:14:08.760 --> 00:14:12.740
put them on a collision course with both Mexican and American armies

254
00:14:18.030 --> 00:14:22.050
One way or another 1883 saw the violence between the three groups come to a head

255
00:14:22.100 --> 00:14:23.370
first, there was the older,

256
00:14:23.560 --> 00:14:26.530
more bitter rivalry between the APA and the Mexicans,

257
00:14:26.531 --> 00:14:29.450
which ended in an all out battle in the mountains,

258
00:14:29.470 --> 00:14:32.170
in the state of Sonora as Romo scouted, the enemy,

259
00:14:32.530 --> 00:14:36.720
he heard the Mexican general strucks meant to kill every single actually men,

260
00:14:36.810 --> 00:14:37.840
women, and children,

261
00:14:37.940 --> 00:14:42.080
and warns that any deserters would be shot on site with little to lose DRMO

262
00:14:42.081 --> 00:14:46.280
signal, the start of the battle by killing the general with a well placed shot.

263
00:14:46.500 --> 00:14:50.120
The fighting lasted all day from sun up to sundown with the Mexican troops

264
00:14:50.121 --> 00:14:55.000
wavering and rallying several times eventually a Fu managed to sneak behind

265
00:14:55.001 --> 00:14:57.960
enemy lines and set far to the long grass behind the Mexican army.

266
00:14:58.100 --> 00:15:01.080
The chaos that ensued allowed the Apache to flee into the mountains.

267
00:15:01.840 --> 00:15:05.040
JMO claims that that was the last time he ever fought the Mexicans.

268
00:15:05.120 --> 00:15:05.940
Surprisingly,

269
00:15:05.940 --> 00:15:10.160
the American army had an uncharacteristically tempered approach trying to find a

270
00:15:10.280 --> 00:15:13.190
peaceful resolutions of their conflict with the Apache. Sure.

271
00:15:13.191 --> 00:15:14.790
They'd started a few skirmishes first.

272
00:15:14.820 --> 00:15:17.590
They didn't carry all of that ammo for nothing after rule,

273
00:15:17.850 --> 00:15:22.070
but eventually they negotiated for the chia returns, the reservation.

274
00:15:22.140 --> 00:15:24.910
This was mainly due to the man in charge general George crook,

275
00:15:24.911 --> 00:15:28.630
who was somewhat of a civil rights advocate for native Americans at a time when

276
00:15:28.631 --> 00:15:31.500
such a position could sink a political on re career.

277
00:15:31.510 --> 00:15:34.580
There was begrudging respect between him and the Apache leaders.

278
00:15:34.690 --> 00:15:39.460
They referred to him as tan Wolf and considered him a good enemy and worthy

279
00:15:39.461 --> 00:15:40.540
adversary. Meanwhile,

280
00:15:40.820 --> 00:15:44.580
crook describes the Jerich Koa Apache as acuteness of sense,

281
00:15:44.581 --> 00:15:47.540
perfect physical condition, absolute knowledge of locality,

282
00:15:47.640 --> 00:15:51.340
almost absolute ability to persevere from danger. We have before us,

283
00:15:51.750 --> 00:15:55.170
the tiger of the human species in his memoirs,

284
00:15:55.490 --> 00:15:58.970
Geronimo gave a much harsher opinion on George crook. He didn't trust him.

285
00:15:58.971 --> 00:16:01.450
And he thought that the general wanted him dead indeed.

286
00:16:01.451 --> 00:16:04.370
While it sounds like the two descriptions might be at odds with each other.

287
00:16:04.580 --> 00:16:08.290
Bet's not really the case. Even some who wanted peace with the tur,

288
00:16:08.610 --> 00:16:12.200
would've realized that they would probably have an easier him,

289
00:16:12.400 --> 00:16:16.200
of some kind of unfortunate accident gone to drawn him outta the way since he

290
00:16:16.201 --> 00:16:17.960
was after the main instigator. Anyway,

291
00:16:18.320 --> 00:16:19.960
crook never attempted anything of the sort.

292
00:16:20.060 --> 00:16:22.680
So we can only speculate on his true intentions.

293
00:16:22.750 --> 00:16:24.640
What we do know is that DRMO Ben,

294
00:16:24.641 --> 00:16:28.240
some of his warriors changed their minds and turns back while the other

295
00:16:29.240 --> 00:16:31.520
Chihuahua taken to a new reservation called Turkey Creek.

296
00:16:31.570 --> 00:16:34.870
Eventually Mo made his way there about a year later,

297
00:16:35.010 --> 00:16:39.230
but life on the reservation didn't stick this time either in 1886,

298
00:16:39.231 --> 00:16:40.790
he instigated another escape.

299
00:16:40.791 --> 00:16:43.830
Even though this time only a few dozen Apache followed him,

300
00:16:43.831 --> 00:16:48.310
perhaps assign more and more of them were getting tired of life on the run like

301
00:16:48.311 --> 00:16:51.990
before drama defaulted to his tried and true tactic of retreating into the

302
00:16:52.190 --> 00:16:53.023
Sierra Madre mountains.

303
00:16:53.500 --> 00:16:56.580
Crook actually caught up to him one last time and persuaded him to surrender

304
00:16:56.581 --> 00:16:57.414
again.

305
00:16:57.540 --> 00:17:00.420
Johno agreed that became convinced that he would be hanged when he reached the

306
00:17:00.421 --> 00:17:04.140
reservation. So he fled for the third time. This was one failure, too many.

307
00:17:04.160 --> 00:17:08.140
And president gro of Cleveland replaced crook with a new general named Nelson

308
00:17:08.700 --> 00:17:11.660
Marles unlike crook, Marles had no respect for the Chi.

309
00:17:12.060 --> 00:17:16.730
Are he didn't care if he brought drawn back in shackles is in a coffin or with

310
00:17:16.731 --> 00:17:20.090
his head on the silver platter. As long as he gone the job done

311
00:17:25.350 --> 00:17:26.850
During J's last run,

312
00:17:26.851 --> 00:17:30.730
he had less than 40 Apache with the Manon 18 of the were warriors. Meanwhile,

313
00:17:30.731 --> 00:17:33.090
general mills had 5,000 soldiers,

314
00:17:33.091 --> 00:17:37.560
hundreds of native American Scouts and a few extra thousand militia.

315
00:17:37.660 --> 00:17:40.560
The scales were just slightly tipped in the latters favor.

316
00:17:40.740 --> 00:17:42.240
The chia still fought,

317
00:17:42.260 --> 00:17:45.840
but the writing was on the wall for Oey surrender was inevitable,

318
00:17:45.841 --> 00:17:49.880
but Marles found a particularly despicable way to hurry it along by punishing

319
00:17:49.881 --> 00:17:54.600
the chia who stayed behind on the reservation over 400 of them were arrested and

320
00:17:54.601 --> 00:17:56.960
sent to prisons in Florida, thousands of miles away.

321
00:17:56.990 --> 00:18:00.720
That way the free chia knew that they would only see them again.

322
00:18:01.060 --> 00:18:03.880
If they surrendered finally in the summer of 1886,

323
00:18:04.160 --> 00:18:07.240
Toronto surrendered at skeleton canyon for the fourth and final time,

324
00:18:07.640 --> 00:18:11.030
I will quit war path and live at peace hereafter.

325
00:18:11.330 --> 00:18:13.150
He told general mills in his memoir.

326
00:18:13.330 --> 00:18:16.630
He said that Mar promised him not only that he would not be arrested,

327
00:18:16.810 --> 00:18:19.910
but that he would receive a house with land and livestock. Of course,

328
00:18:20.430 --> 00:18:22.550
Jonah wasn't stupid enough to actually believe this,

329
00:18:22.690 --> 00:18:26.230
but he hoped that Marles would at least respect the conditions of the surrender,

330
00:18:26.231 --> 00:18:30.340
which included allowing the chia to see their FA am in Florida. However,

331
00:18:30.360 --> 00:18:34.220
the us government had a nice little streak of broken treaties going.

332
00:18:34.400 --> 00:18:39.300
So what difference would just one more make almost as soon as the deal was

333
00:18:39.301 --> 00:18:43.180
signed miles declared ital reasoning that Geronimo had broken previous terms of

334
00:18:43.340 --> 00:18:45.100
surrender. In reality, it is highly doubtful.

335
00:18:45.101 --> 00:18:48.340
He would've ever accepted anything other than a complete and unconditional

336
00:18:48.500 --> 00:18:48.840
surrender.

337
00:18:48.840 --> 00:18:52.970
The iCal are when now prisoners of the us army bringing an end to the Apache

338
00:18:53.000 --> 00:18:53.291
wars,

339
00:18:53.291 --> 00:18:56.690
even though minor skirmish has still continued for a few more decades following

340
00:18:56.691 --> 00:18:59.610
their arrest DRMO and the rest of his band boarded, a train,

341
00:18:59.620 --> 00:19:02.810
never to return to the lands that they knew and loved. First,

342
00:19:02.840 --> 00:19:04.650
they were taken to Fort Pickens in Florida,

343
00:19:04.660 --> 00:19:07.690
where they were forced to do hard labor every day. Meanwhile,

344
00:19:07.691 --> 00:19:11.080
the first group of Jurich AUA was Withing away due to malaria.

345
00:19:11.440 --> 00:19:14.160
And so it was moved to Mount Vernon and Alabama.

346
00:19:14.300 --> 00:19:17.720
It wasn't until two years later, the OSE group was finally allowed to join them.

347
00:19:17.721 --> 00:19:18.560
And when this happened,

348
00:19:18.680 --> 00:19:22.240
a wave of tuberculosis tried to finish what the malaria had started during the

349
00:19:22.241 --> 00:19:23.074
mid 1890s,

350
00:19:23.280 --> 00:19:27.480
that Chihuahua relocated again to fought SI reservation in Oklahoma,

351
00:19:27.570 --> 00:19:31.350
since the landscape better resembled the environment that were familiar with.

352
00:19:31.370 --> 00:19:35.110
But by that point only 120 or so chia remained.

353
00:19:35.180 --> 00:19:37.950
That is where Geronimo spent the last 15 years of his life.

354
00:19:38.010 --> 00:19:40.670
He tried his best to fit in. He took up farming.

355
00:19:40.730 --> 00:19:43.550
He even became a Christian and joined the Dutch reform church,

356
00:19:43.610 --> 00:19:45.910
but was kicked out because he wouldn't stop gambling.

357
00:19:46.140 --> 00:19:49.190
When he promised to quit the war path and live in peace. He meant it,

358
00:19:49.260 --> 00:19:52.620
even though he was frustrated and hard broken by the government's continued

359
00:19:52.621 --> 00:19:56.620
refusal to allow him to return home. He never took up arms again.

360
00:19:56.930 --> 00:20:00.780
Instead Toronto made the best of a bad situation by capitalizing on his

361
00:20:00.781 --> 00:20:05.020
notoriety as the worst Indian that ever lived. That's how he built himself.

362
00:20:05.040 --> 00:20:05.980
As he toward the nation,

363
00:20:05.981 --> 00:20:09.460
appearing at affairs and exhibitions in front of stunned audiences,

364
00:20:09.660 --> 00:20:11.300
he had only reads and herd ho.

365
00:20:11.810 --> 00:20:14.490
He is about the ferocity and cruelty of the infamous Romo.

366
00:20:14.510 --> 00:20:17.850
He even took part in Teddy Roosevelt's presidential inauguration parade.

367
00:20:17.990 --> 00:20:20.250
It was all pure exploitation of course,

368
00:20:20.270 --> 00:20:23.010
but Romo made more money now than he had in his whole life.

369
00:20:23.070 --> 00:20:26.370
He signed anything and everything that had his signature on sold out.

370
00:20:26.770 --> 00:20:31.330
And so it was that the once ruthless killer became one of the hottest brands in

371
00:20:31.331 --> 00:20:34.600
the country Mo died on February the 17th, 1909.

372
00:20:34.660 --> 00:20:38.280
He had been bucked off his horse while riding home and the 79 year old spent the

373
00:20:38.281 --> 00:20:41.400
whole night in the cold before anyone found him. By that point,

374
00:20:41.420 --> 00:20:45.320
he fell with pneumonia and died a few days later in recent decades,

375
00:20:45.680 --> 00:20:47.440
a strange urban legend is AISM,

376
00:20:47.441 --> 00:20:50.880
which says that members from the skull and bone society at Yale university

377
00:20:50.881 --> 00:20:53.680
robbed the grave in 1918 and stalled roo skull.

378
00:20:53.940 --> 00:20:56.840
And that it's still in their possession truth is that we don't really know

379
00:20:56.841 --> 00:21:00.520
what's inside the grave because the army filled it with cement in 1928 and

380
00:21:00.521 --> 00:21:02.120
placed a stone monument on top of it.

381
00:21:02.140 --> 00:21:06.440
So for now this remains the final uncertain chapter in the,

382
00:21:06.510 --> 00:21:08.510
the life story of Geronimo.

383
00:21:13.770 --> 00:21:15.750
