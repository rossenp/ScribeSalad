It's free to join in. You can skip a month. Any time you like.

9
00:00:25.780 --> 00:00:29.910
I've actually had a few boxes from them. And down right here, I have,

10
00:00:29.911 --> 00:00:33.070
this was a weekend bag that I got from them, which is a really heavy,

11
00:00:33.260 --> 00:00:37.110
well built. Nice high quality bit of kits. You open it up,

12
00:00:37.111 --> 00:00:41.500
you pop all your stuff in there. Nice, really nice weekend bag, very goods.

13
00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:44.100
Each box has at least $70 in retail value.

14
00:00:44.300 --> 00:00:48.860
<v 0>The cost it's only $45. The second thing I got from them was this, uh,</v>

15
00:00:48.880 --> 00:00:51.140
spirit agent, kid. And I thought it was for whiskey at first,

16
00:00:51.141 --> 00:00:52.580
but actually you don't put whiskey in there.

17
00:00:52.581 --> 00:00:54.900
So what I'm gonna do is put gin in here. This isn't OK.

18
00:00:54.980 --> 00:00:57.260
I think they call it a sta and it's char.

19
00:00:57.440 --> 00:01:00.980
And basically I just got this the other day. So when I a chance to do this yet,

20
00:01:00.981 --> 00:01:03.570
but I'm popping some gin in there. It apparently ages,

21
00:01:03.571 --> 00:01:05.210
it beautifully takes about 10 days.

22
00:01:05.211 --> 00:01:07.770
And then you have a whole different flavor profile on your spirit,

23
00:01:07.771 --> 00:01:12.490
which is fantastic. Plus two glasses like this here. Doesn't love that.

24
00:01:12.590 --> 00:01:13.570
And if you don't like the box,

25
00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:16.890
they send you feel free to swap it for one of their many, many other boxes.

26
00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:20.410
The box line is constantly changing each month, so it can be great for you,

27
00:01:20.411 --> 00:01:23.680
but it's also great as a gift for, for a loved one. Right now,

32
00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:44.030
Our 390 BC,

33
00:01:44.090 --> 00:01:48.830
the Roman Republic fought a Gaelic tribe called theones led by chief

34
00:01:49.230 --> 00:01:51.630
Tae, named Brene who had invaded Italy.

35
00:01:52.070 --> 00:01:55.790
The conflicts culminated at the battle of a river where the Romans suffered a

36
00:01:55.791 --> 00:01:57.110
crushing defeat. Afterwards,

37
00:01:57.130 --> 00:02:00.750
the GOs marched on Rome itself and sacked the city plundering its riches burning

38
00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:05.580
down its buildings and killing or enslaving its citizens. Although humiliating.

39
00:02:05.770 --> 00:02:07.700
This was not a shocking outcome.

40
00:02:07.701 --> 00:02:11.260
The Roman Republic was still in its infancy and did not even have full control

41
00:02:11.261 --> 00:02:12.140
over Italy yet.

42
00:02:12.160 --> 00:02:15.780
And it was far from the Imperial powerhouse that it would turn into over the

43
00:02:15.781 --> 00:02:16.501
coming centuries,

44
00:02:16.501 --> 00:02:20.100
despite the Acking Rome flourished and continued to grow the Republic collapsed

45
00:02:20.101 --> 00:02:22.300
and made way for the rise of the Roman empire,

46
00:02:22.301 --> 00:02:26.410
which became even at the height of its power. It stretched over half of Europe,

47
00:02:26.411 --> 00:02:27.810
plus parts of Africa and Asia.

48
00:02:28.030 --> 00:02:31.690
The sacking of Rome from three 90 BC was a distant memory.

49
00:02:31.790 --> 00:02:35.010
And the idea that it could ever happen again was unthinkable,

50
00:02:35.190 --> 00:02:39.690
but then came alls the first king of a Gothic people known as the Visigoths in

51
00:02:40.330 --> 00:02:45.240
410 80 here at Rome is mercy. 800 years had passed, but the UN happened again.

52
00:02:45.710 --> 00:02:47.080
Rome was sacked.

53
00:02:47.110 --> 00:02:50.440
This was a clear sign that the Western Roman and empire could no longer be

54
00:02:50.530 --> 00:02:52.240
saved. It collapsed that same century.

55
00:02:52.241 --> 00:02:56.040
Thanks in no small parts of the actions of the vis Garth led by king. I

56
00:03:02.420 --> 00:03:06.840
Unsurprisingly A's early history is full of gaps and all the things we do know

57
00:03:06.910 --> 00:03:10.440
have to be taken with a grain of salt. We don't know his year of birth,

58
00:03:10.500 --> 00:03:14.000
but it is estimated to be sometime around 370 80,

59
00:03:14.090 --> 00:03:17.800
given his age when sacked Rome, we don't know his place of birth either,

60
00:03:18.020 --> 00:03:20.830
but ancient historian said it was pew island,

61
00:03:21.110 --> 00:03:25.790
a location that supposedly existed during ancient times in the Dan Delta

62
00:03:25.970 --> 00:03:29.510
in modern day Romania. And what was known back then as SI minor,

63
00:03:29.990 --> 00:03:33.670
all origins are just as murky. He was a goth that much we can say,

64
00:03:33.990 --> 00:03:37.630
but we are unsure of the tribe that he was a part of the goths were a loose

65
00:03:37.631 --> 00:03:41.340
coalition of Germanic ball that shared a culture and a language,

66
00:03:41.360 --> 00:03:45.660
but maintains their own territory and were each led by a different chief TA to

67
00:03:45.661 --> 00:03:47.260
make matters, more confusing.

68
00:03:47.490 --> 00:03:51.220
Most ancient Roman and Greek sources usually didn't bother to distinguish

69
00:03:51.221 --> 00:03:56.140
between different tribes and just called them all goths or barbarians during

70
00:03:56.380 --> 00:03:56.781
all time.

71
00:03:56.781 --> 00:04:01.650
The two biggest groups were the VEI and the group sungi and he was most

72
00:04:01.710 --> 00:04:03.570
likely a part of the former. In fact,

73
00:04:03.630 --> 00:04:08.610
one of the main ancient sources on ER historian named Jordans claims that

74
00:04:08.611 --> 00:04:12.290
the future king was part of a ruling dynasty called Bolty,

75
00:04:12.291 --> 00:04:15.770
which was apparently among the most noble families of the goth. Second,

76
00:04:15.771 --> 00:04:17.730
only to the Amali dynasty.

77
00:04:18.130 --> 00:04:21.120
This same point of view is promoted by 80 century historian,

78
00:04:21.121 --> 00:04:23.920
Edward Gibbon in his seminal work on the history of Rome,

79
00:04:23.921 --> 00:04:26.600
which we will also be using as a main source today.

80
00:04:26.840 --> 00:04:30.600
Whatever his heritage might have been alre grew up at a time of conflict.

81
00:04:30.700 --> 00:04:34.960
One of the many great Gothic wars that occurred between the Germanic tribes and

82
00:04:34.961 --> 00:04:36.400
the Roman empire on this occasion,

83
00:04:36.401 --> 00:04:40.320
they were threatened by an even bigger danger coming from the east pillar,

84
00:04:40.850 --> 00:04:43.230
all the sediments, unfortunate enough to be in their way,

85
00:04:43.231 --> 00:04:44.990
this left the goths with little choice,

86
00:04:45.090 --> 00:04:49.630
but to enter Roman territory and ask for permission to settle inside the empire.

87
00:04:49.690 --> 00:04:52.510
At first, there was a reluctant agreement between the two sides,

88
00:04:52.530 --> 00:04:55.550
mainly because the Eastern Roman emperor valance was busy,

89
00:04:55.551 --> 00:04:58.430
getting ready to go to Persia and didn't want other distractions,

90
00:04:58.570 --> 00:05:01.820
but neither side was truly happy with the situation. So inevitably,

91
00:05:01.900 --> 00:05:06.740
a warrior erupted in 376 ad was the goth led by a Sian chief name

92
00:05:06.750 --> 00:05:07.860
named Fregon.

93
00:05:08.040 --> 00:05:12.980
The conflict took a significant turn following the battle of Adrian Opal in 378

94
00:05:13.280 --> 00:05:16.940
ad, which not only ended with a decisive Gothic victory,

95
00:05:17.240 --> 00:05:20.740
but also led to the death of two thirds of the Roman army,

96
00:05:20.770 --> 00:05:23.690
including an surveillance even so Fri gun.

97
00:05:23.750 --> 00:05:27.530
And the goths were unable to capitalize on their success. Following the battle.

98
00:05:27.800 --> 00:05:29.010
They tried to take the city,

99
00:05:29.030 --> 00:05:32.850
but their attempt failed because they lacked any siege weaponry to break down

100
00:05:32.851 --> 00:05:35.290
the walls. The war carried on for a few more years,

101
00:05:35.291 --> 00:05:38.850
without any more significant battles until the new emperor see dos.

102
00:05:39.010 --> 00:05:43.840
The first negotiated a piece where the goths received an exchange for service in

103
00:05:43.841 --> 00:05:45.720
the Roman military as auxiliary units,

104
00:05:45.990 --> 00:05:50.240
this kind of treaty was called a photos while the people bounds by it,

105
00:05:50.241 --> 00:05:54.640
who weren't Romans were known as prate and were not considered Roman citizens

106
00:05:54.641 --> 00:05:56.000
afterwards, UR,

107
00:05:56.260 --> 00:06:00.400
the other Gothic leaders disappear from the historical record and their fate

108
00:06:00.420 --> 00:06:01.520
remain unknown.

109
00:06:08.120 --> 00:06:11.560
This situation was relatively peaceful for the next decade and a half the goths

110
00:06:11.561 --> 00:06:13.680
and the Romans weren't exactly friendly with each other,

111
00:06:13.860 --> 00:06:18.550
but they weren't hostile either as both sides held up their ends of the bargain.

112
00:06:19.110 --> 00:06:23.030
It's also around this time that we start seeing mentions of Visigoths and Astra

113
00:06:23.040 --> 00:06:26.710
goths instead of Thue and grungy we're the former,

114
00:06:26.850 --> 00:06:28.390
the descendants of the latter role,

115
00:06:28.490 --> 00:06:31.230
simply two sets of names for the same people. Well,

116
00:06:31.231 --> 00:06:36.070
it's hard to say Casie Doris seems to be the first one to record the terms BIS

117
00:06:36.430 --> 00:06:37.460
goths and as ATHS,

118
00:06:37.461 --> 00:06:41.500
which was meant to distinguish between the Western and Eastern groups of photo

119
00:06:42.020 --> 00:06:42.040
Arti,

120
00:06:42.040 --> 00:06:46.740
but whether or not they correspond to exactly to the th of Ingi and sungi or

121
00:06:46.741 --> 00:06:49.940
whether they were an amalgamation of previous tribes is uncertain.

122
00:06:50.090 --> 00:06:52.780
What we do know is that by the time LA came to power,

123
00:06:53.180 --> 00:06:55.540
it was called king of the vis Garth term,

124
00:06:55.541 --> 00:06:58.490
which the goths eventually adopted them Alps. Anyway,

125
00:06:58.491 --> 00:07:01.890
when he grew up a LA entered military service serving under a commander named

126
00:07:02.610 --> 00:07:02.670
Guyers,

127
00:07:02.670 --> 00:07:07.410
who was himself of Gothic heritage Ember Theodosia soon required his new army

128
00:07:07.550 --> 00:07:10.970
as he was forced to wage war against the Western Roman em empire in order to

129
00:07:10.971 --> 00:07:14.490
stop a Serpa from claiming his throne in 392 80,

130
00:07:14.550 --> 00:07:18.760
the Western Roman emperor Valenti thei died, found hang in his own home.

131
00:07:19.040 --> 00:07:21.400
Although his death was ostensibly declared a suicide,

132
00:07:21.401 --> 00:07:25.880
many sources reported that he had been murdered by an officer named AAST

133
00:07:26.560 --> 00:07:30.640
agast was a man who wielded great power and influence in Valenti's courts,

134
00:07:30.641 --> 00:07:34.320
but fears that he was going to lose it all after an argument with the emperor,

135
00:07:34.321 --> 00:07:37.480
therefore he had Valenti killed and using his authority,

136
00:07:37.620 --> 00:07:41.750
had a man named Eugen declares the new ruler of the Western Roman empire.

137
00:07:42.070 --> 00:07:46.230
Although he clearly would've been simply a puppet figure while Arba Gast held

138
00:07:46.231 --> 00:07:50.910
the true power. Theodosius had no intention of letting Eugen take the throne.

139
00:07:51.010 --> 00:07:51.950
So Hema,

140
00:07:52.070 --> 00:07:56.590
a large army and Annes met his enemies at the battle of Fri us in September 394

141
00:07:56.590 --> 00:07:58.150
80, the fight ended in a bloody,

142
00:07:58.210 --> 00:08:01.940
but decisive the for Theo dose who had no reservation about using his

143
00:08:01.941 --> 00:08:03.340
auxiliaries as cannon fodder.

144
00:08:03.341 --> 00:08:06.900
When they took the enemy camp Eugenius was captured and beheaded. Meanwhile,

145
00:08:07.380 --> 00:08:09.340
Arbi gas managed to escape, but committed suicide.

146
00:08:09.341 --> 00:08:11.060
A few days later when he entered Rome,

147
00:08:11.070 --> 00:08:15.580
Theodosius named his young son Anor as the new Western Roman and

148
00:08:15.780 --> 00:08:20.610
emperor and named his trusted general still G as his and the guy

149
00:08:20.611 --> 00:08:23.050
who'd actually make the important decisions without settled.

150
00:08:23.051 --> 00:08:25.290
Theodosius set to return to constant, to noble,

151
00:08:25.291 --> 00:08:29.330
but died on the way his oldest son Arcadia succeeded him as ruler of the Eastern

152
00:08:29.400 --> 00:08:30.330
half of the empire.

153
00:08:30.360 --> 00:08:35.090
This was the start of a period of serious instability for the Roman empire one,

154
00:08:35.091 --> 00:08:36.850
from which it never truly recovered,

155
00:08:36.920 --> 00:08:41.400
both Anor and Arcadia were young and in exp SCRs who were easily

156
00:08:41.401 --> 00:08:44.440
controlled by other people, such as still and,

157
00:08:44.760 --> 00:08:46.520
and other statesmen named Rus,

158
00:08:46.660 --> 00:08:49.160
but they had an even bigger problem on their hands.

159
00:08:49.480 --> 00:08:52.240
As the Goffs were no longer happy with their arrangements.

160
00:08:52.380 --> 00:08:56.520
By the time of the battle of fried us all was in commands of the Gothic troops,

161
00:08:56.540 --> 00:09:00.920
but he felt that they had not been rewarded justly for the sacrifice of his

162
00:09:00.921 --> 00:09:03.200
people. His men Bo the brunt of the attack,

163
00:09:03.220 --> 00:09:07.280
and he had lost thousands of soldiers for which he only received pittance from

164
00:09:07.281 --> 00:09:08.010
the emperor.

165
00:09:08.010 --> 00:09:11.760
Theodosius the fact of the matter was that heavy Gothic casualties worked out in

166
00:09:11.761 --> 00:09:15.070
the Romans favors since he meant fewer enemies to fight should the two who signs

167
00:09:15.190 --> 00:09:17.430
ever come to blows a gang. This wasn't good enough anymore.

168
00:09:17.490 --> 00:09:21.470
So all now recognized as king of the VI goths rebelled against the Romans,

169
00:09:21.471 --> 00:09:26.150
according to ancient historians ness all did this with the encouragement of Ru

170
00:09:26.470 --> 00:09:29.070
iners, who was the defacto ruler of the Eastern Roman embar,

171
00:09:29.100 --> 00:09:30.910
even though Arcadia sat on the throne.

172
00:09:30.940 --> 00:09:33.750
This was because Rus knew that the goths would plunder.

173
00:09:33.810 --> 00:09:37.180
The Western half was controlled by his arch enemy, still show.

174
00:09:37.280 --> 00:09:38.980
And even if Al failed,

175
00:09:39.000 --> 00:09:42.740
he might have weakened still show enough for him to then swoop in and assume

176
00:09:42.741 --> 00:09:47.460
control of the entire empire things didn't really turn out as either Al or Rus

177
00:09:47.510 --> 00:09:51.220
hoped the Gulf wents on a pillaging campaign through Greece targeting Macedonia

178
00:09:52.060 --> 00:09:54.180
ly and the Mar league Al wanted to take Athens.

179
00:09:54.181 --> 00:09:55.460
But when he arrived at the city war,

180
00:09:55.790 --> 00:09:59.330
he was all struck by the beauty of this ancient city and decided against it.

181
00:09:59.350 --> 00:10:01.370
He asked for entry under peaceful terms,

182
00:10:01.371 --> 00:10:03.890
which was granted to him and a small number of his troops.

183
00:10:03.891 --> 00:10:06.370
And he enjoyed the greatest hospitality in the city.

184
00:10:06.510 --> 00:10:08.090
He departed without any violence.

185
00:10:08.280 --> 00:10:12.290
This however was not the case with the rest of Greece as Magars Corinth, Argos,

186
00:10:12.330 --> 00:10:14.690
and even Sparta fell under the Gothic wrath,

187
00:10:14.700 --> 00:10:18.400
eventually still a show gathered his troops and went to deal with all,

188
00:10:18.690 --> 00:10:20.360
we're not sure on the details,

189
00:10:20.361 --> 00:10:23.960
but it seems like still a show had trapped the goths and would've been able to

190
00:10:23.961 --> 00:10:26.920
wipe them out completely, if not for the intervention of Rus,

191
00:10:26.921 --> 00:10:30.800
he persuaded emperor Arcadia to order St. Aro to return part of his army,

192
00:10:30.850 --> 00:10:33.440
which came from the Eastern remin, em empire, still show obey,

193
00:10:33.540 --> 00:10:37.910
but also sent some mercenaries who struck down Ru when the opportunity presented

194
00:10:37.911 --> 00:10:41.550
itself escaping with his head while singing songs of triumph,

195
00:10:48.190 --> 00:10:48.690
Reus was gone,

196
00:10:48.690 --> 00:10:53.070
but he was simply replaced with another official named utopia who manipulated

197
00:10:53.130 --> 00:10:55.030
the naive emperor for his own games.

198
00:10:55.330 --> 00:10:59.540
He also opposed still a so the situation was very much the same as before.

199
00:10:59.541 --> 00:11:02.500
Meanwhile, the Romans also had to deal with the picks in Britain,

200
00:11:02.550 --> 00:11:03.780
other Germanic tribes,

201
00:11:03.781 --> 00:11:08.060
such as the vandals and the suey plus the impending danger posed by the Huns.

202
00:11:08.061 --> 00:11:09.900
In other words, there had a lot on their plate.

203
00:11:09.960 --> 00:11:13.820
So the vis Garth went exactly a high priority after all the goths didn't attack

204
00:11:13.821 --> 00:11:17.770
with any grand ambitions of taking down the empire or conquering a province or

205
00:11:17.890 --> 00:11:20.610
anything like that, they just wanted a fair treaty with the Romans,

206
00:11:20.670 --> 00:11:25.410
the emperor placated them, which ended all's first invasion in 397 ad.

207
00:11:25.580 --> 00:11:27.330
We're not sure about the terms,

208
00:11:27.690 --> 00:11:31.610
although some sources claim that all was given the title of Machester Milam in

209
00:11:31.611 --> 00:11:35.330
the province of lyric, this pacifies the Visigoths for a few years,

210
00:11:35.390 --> 00:11:39.800
but in 401 80, they decided to attack this time, invading Italy directly.

211
00:11:39.870 --> 00:11:43.200
Initially this put the Western Roman empire in a very precarious position

212
00:11:43.201 --> 00:11:46.120
because it had very few troops in Italy itself. Instead,

213
00:11:46.130 --> 00:11:50.200
still a show had to travel to the province of Russia to raise an army,

214
00:11:50.300 --> 00:11:55.120
and then to Goul where he persuaded another dramatic tribe known as the Aman to

215
00:11:55.121 --> 00:11:56.240
join his ranks. Meanwhile,

216
00:11:56.480 --> 00:12:00.240
all Rick and his army were nearing media LAN known today as Milan,

217
00:12:00.241 --> 00:12:04.920
which was the new capital of the Western Roman empire and the place where

218
00:12:05.240 --> 00:12:09.400
Ember Onor was eagerly, awaiting reinforcements. Edward Gibb mentions that St.

219
00:12:09.640 --> 00:12:13.150
Joe more or less had to leave Goul and the German provinces almost done defended

220
00:12:13.151 --> 00:12:16.270
in order to secure the forces necessary to defeat allure,

221
00:12:16.390 --> 00:12:20.750
a sign of the decline of the Roman empire that had been decay by centuries and

222
00:12:20.751 --> 00:12:22.950
centuries of fighting to preserve its borders.

223
00:12:23.270 --> 00:12:27.510
GI also speculates that SIL show was banking on heavy rains and melting snows,

224
00:12:27.511 --> 00:12:30.110
Towell up the rivers, thus slowing down the vis goths.

225
00:12:30.110 --> 00:12:34.060
But the opposite happened a very dry season meant that rivers were quite shallow

226
00:12:34.080 --> 00:12:38.540
and easy to traverse. So the goths arrived as media Lanham. Well, before him,

227
00:12:38.560 --> 00:12:40.860
as all approached the rules of the capital,

228
00:12:41.200 --> 00:12:45.700
he saw honors accompanied by a feeble train of statesman and Unix retreating

229
00:12:45.701 --> 00:12:49.540
toward the abs, which filled them with the satisfaction of seeing the Roman em,

230
00:12:49.980 --> 00:12:53.300
flee before him with the goths on his tail honors at no other option,

231
00:12:53.530 --> 00:12:57.850
except to take refuge inside a fortified city in Lauria and hope that still a

232
00:12:57.970 --> 00:13:00.770
show arrived in time. Fortunately for him, that's exactly what happened.

233
00:13:01.170 --> 00:13:02.290
All laid siege,

234
00:13:02.291 --> 00:13:06.290
but still a show when his army arrived forcing regards to retreat Westwood to

235
00:13:06.291 --> 00:13:08.530
the city of Poncia known today,

236
00:13:08.590 --> 00:13:11.770
as Lenzo the conflict dominated with the battle of PIO,

237
00:13:11.820 --> 00:13:16.480
which quite controversially took play on April the sixth 400 to a D Easter

238
00:13:16.920 --> 00:13:17.280
day.

239
00:13:17.280 --> 00:13:20.960
So the show was counting on the facts that the goths who were mostly Christian

240
00:13:21.140 --> 00:13:23.880
by this point would be busy with celebrations on that day.

241
00:13:23.900 --> 00:13:27.280
So he sent an army led by one of his most trusted general Saul,

242
00:13:27.300 --> 00:13:29.960
who wasn't Christian to launch a surprise attack.

243
00:13:29.990 --> 00:13:33.480
This didn't quite have the desired effect because all defeated Saul,

244
00:13:33.481 --> 00:13:37.070
thus forcing, still show himself to lead the charge with his remaining troops.

245
00:13:37.071 --> 00:13:40.150
He defeated the goths and managed to recover most of the loot that they had

246
00:13:40.270 --> 00:13:43.150
plunged. Plus thousands of captives who had been taken as slaves.

247
00:13:43.300 --> 00:13:47.270
This was not the ends of the invasion because although all Rick had lost most of

248
00:13:47.271 --> 00:13:50.630
his infantry, his Calvary was still intact. So he decided to keep going,

249
00:13:50.870 --> 00:13:54.510
determined to conquer or die before the gates of Rome. So the show, however,

250
00:13:55.060 --> 00:13:58.940
coming and had managed to intercept the vis goths and the two sides fought ones

251
00:13:58.941 --> 00:14:03.740
more outside the city of AONA the Roman general one again, and this time, ER,

252
00:14:03.760 --> 00:14:07.660
had been soundly defeated yet still the vis goth survived because the Romans

253
00:14:07.820 --> 00:14:10.780
considered it better for them to strike a deal rather than to destroy them.

254
00:14:10.781 --> 00:14:14.660
It is likely that still show developed a respect for ER's determination and his

255
00:14:14.661 --> 00:14:15.494
skill. And he,

256
00:14:15.730 --> 00:14:19.530
he considered him useful since the Statesman's greatest ambition was to unite

257
00:14:19.531 --> 00:14:21.730
the two HARs of the Roman empire under his rule.

258
00:14:21.990 --> 00:14:26.090
One thing that Alex invasion did accomplish was to show the world how vulnerable

259
00:14:26.300 --> 00:14:30.930
media Lanham was after the war concluded an Aus moved the capital city to

260
00:14:31.650 --> 00:14:32.970
Ravo, which was better fortified.

261
00:14:33.210 --> 00:14:35.730
And it remained the capital until the collapse of the Western Roman,

262
00:14:42.600 --> 00:14:44.920
Whatever planned still show had for the Eastern Roman empire.

263
00:14:44.950 --> 00:14:47.240
They had to wait since he was now faced with a new enemy.

264
00:14:47.550 --> 00:14:51.320
Many Germanic tribes had United under a king named Ratta geese.

265
00:14:51.380 --> 00:14:55.520
And this included some of A's troops who had lost faith in him following his

266
00:14:56.040 --> 00:15:00.680
successive defeats described by historian AIAS as the most Savage of all our

267
00:15:00.681 --> 00:15:01.514
enemies.

268
00:15:01.520 --> 00:15:06.160
Ratta geese was a pagan and Ayan who had vowed to spill all the Roman

269
00:15:06.210 --> 00:15:09.560
blood as an offering to his gods. Still show was once again,

270
00:15:09.561 --> 00:15:13.030
task with eliminate this new threat. The Roman general was outnumbered,

271
00:15:13.050 --> 00:15:14.270
but fortunately for him,

272
00:15:14.630 --> 00:15:17.470
RA geese had decided to split his army into three parts.

273
00:15:17.610 --> 00:15:21.190
Two of them were sent on rating missions while the bulk of the army accompanied

274
00:15:21.191 --> 00:15:23.310
him as he laid siege on Florence,

275
00:15:23.360 --> 00:15:27.110
still a choke decided on a big surprise attack, which overwhelm his enemies,

276
00:15:27.111 --> 00:15:31.780
forcing them to lift their siege and retreat toy Sui there at battle took place

277
00:15:31.781 --> 00:15:33.100
in August 400, 6 80,

278
00:15:33.101 --> 00:15:37.620
which resulted in a decisive Roman victory and the execution of rat ISIS.

279
00:15:37.880 --> 00:15:40.180
One man's loss was another man's gain.

280
00:15:40.200 --> 00:15:43.940
As many of the surviving goths returned to allure who was steadily rebuilding

281
00:15:43.960 --> 00:15:46.860
his army even. So he was not ready to invade Italy again,

282
00:15:46.880 --> 00:15:49.780
as he was still waiting for still a show to enact his plan against the Eastern

283
00:15:49.781 --> 00:15:52.330
Roman empire. The general was delayed once again, however,

284
00:15:52.510 --> 00:15:55.290
due to the emergence of a new pretender to the Western throne,

285
00:15:55.470 --> 00:15:57.090
his name was Constantine. The third,

286
00:15:57.290 --> 00:16:00.370
he was declared the new emperor by his troops, following his tribes in Britain.

287
00:16:00.470 --> 00:16:05.130
He then established himself in GA fully intending to cross into Italy and depose

288
00:16:05.450 --> 00:16:05.811
an Orus,

289
00:16:05.811 --> 00:16:10.010
which obviously would've meant that still a show had to go as well in 407 80,

290
00:16:10.330 --> 00:16:14.760
all decided that he had wait in Hans demanded from still showed the payments,

291
00:16:14.761 --> 00:16:18.240
which was promised in exchange for his assistance against the Eastern empire,

292
00:16:18.350 --> 00:16:20.520
allegedly this amounted to 4,000 pounds of gold.

293
00:16:20.960 --> 00:16:23.680
So the show tried to persuade the Senate to agree to the payment.

294
00:16:23.740 --> 00:16:27.240
He found the terms much too costly, deeming it, not a treaty of peace,

295
00:16:27.500 --> 00:16:28.360
but of servitude.

296
00:16:28.760 --> 00:16:32.040
The Stiller chose reputation within the Western empire took a serious hit.

297
00:16:32.550 --> 00:16:34.710
When the Eastern REM emperor Arcadia died,

298
00:16:34.711 --> 00:16:38.990
an enemy of still show named Olympus started spreading a rumor that stich show

299
00:16:39.020 --> 00:16:43.790
used the money as a bribe intending to use the VI goths to March on constant and

300
00:16:44.030 --> 00:16:47.870
noble and install his own son UCAR as the new emperor. Indeed,

301
00:16:48.100 --> 00:16:50.150
this might not have been that far from the truth,

302
00:16:50.151 --> 00:16:54.140
but it certainly was believable enough that Anor set still. The show arrested.

303
00:16:54.360 --> 00:16:57.460
The Roman general was executed on August the 22nd, 408,

304
00:16:57.840 --> 00:17:01.300
and his son soon followed the Romans might have eliminated one internal threats,

305
00:17:01.301 --> 00:17:05.940
but now the man who twice managed to save the Western Roman empire from Errick

306
00:17:06.240 --> 00:17:07.073
was dead,

307
00:17:13.240 --> 00:17:17.530
Was chose demise. Olympus became one of the emperor's most trusted advisors,

308
00:17:17.531 --> 00:17:20.650
and he took a much more aggressive stance against the goths,

309
00:17:20.651 --> 00:17:23.810
even the Pari who were technically on his site at one point,

310
00:17:23.840 --> 00:17:27.250
Olympus orchestrated a purge and massacre, thousands of Gothic families,

311
00:17:27.251 --> 00:17:31.050
mainly women and children who had settled on Roman land. Obviously this enraged,

312
00:17:31.210 --> 00:17:33.850
their husbands, most of whom had been part of stich show's army.

313
00:17:34.100 --> 00:17:39.080
So they defected Alec ready to enact vengeance on the Roman embar estimates say

314
00:17:39.081 --> 00:17:42.720
that this caused anywhere from 10,000 to 30,000 soldiers to switch sides.

315
00:17:42.850 --> 00:17:46.120
Since Olympus considered Eck, a former ally, still a show,

316
00:17:46.220 --> 00:17:49.480
he was declared an enemy of Rome, but this suited interest fine.

317
00:17:49.620 --> 00:17:52.840
It was clear that he was not going to receive what had been promised to him.

318
00:17:52.860 --> 00:17:57.000
And he now had a large army out for Roman blood to nobody surprised just a few

319
00:17:57.001 --> 00:17:58.600
months later after still have Joe's death.

320
00:17:58.600 --> 00:18:01.000
The vis goths attacked the Western Roman empire. Again,

321
00:18:01.150 --> 00:18:04.040
many cities fell before the might of a, but not Raven.

322
00:18:04.041 --> 00:18:08.320
Instead a marched on Rome considering to be a preferable target in September

323
00:18:08.510 --> 00:18:11.030
hundred, eight 80 without encountering a single army.

324
00:18:11.090 --> 00:18:15.670
The Visigoths arrived at the gates of the eternal city and laid siege.

325
00:18:15.850 --> 00:18:19.190
The Roman ability first reacted with indignation and in incredulity,

326
00:18:19.410 --> 00:18:24.190
how dare a barbarian salt Roman, such a way, but as time went on with supplies,

327
00:18:24.191 --> 00:18:28.670
dwindling and no reinforcement in sight, those feelings turned to fear, panic,

328
00:18:29.500 --> 00:18:32.820
an anger. Their first reaction was to execute Serena the widow of St.

329
00:18:33.100 --> 00:18:35.740
Acho for allegedly conspiring with the goths, shockingly,

330
00:18:35.741 --> 00:18:38.980
this didn't solve anything. And Rome soon fell preyed.

331
00:18:39.060 --> 00:18:40.860
A famine as described by Edward,

332
00:18:40.861 --> 00:18:45.380
given a dark suspicion was entertained that some desperate retches fed on the

333
00:18:45.500 --> 00:18:48.700
bodies of their fellow creatures, whom they had secretly murdered.

334
00:18:48.730 --> 00:18:52.850
Many thousand of inhabitants of Rome expired in their houses or in the streets

335
00:18:52.990 --> 00:18:54.370
for want of sustenance.

336
00:18:54.510 --> 00:18:59.450
The stent witch arose from so many PNS unburied carcasses infected the air and

337
00:18:59.451 --> 00:19:03.850
the misery of famine were succeeded and aggravated by the contagion of a pal

338
00:19:03.851 --> 00:19:07.530
disease. Only after realizing that there was no help from Rav forthcoming,

339
00:19:07.550 --> 00:19:11.640
did the Romans admit that they were at the mercy of ball, they sent Aries,

340
00:19:11.740 --> 00:19:14.920
but even then they still refused to submit to the Bob Arians.

341
00:19:14.950 --> 00:19:18.200
They warn Alrick that the terms of their capitulation were not fair.

342
00:19:18.390 --> 00:19:21.320
Then they would sound the trumpets causing an innumerable.

343
00:19:21.321 --> 00:19:25.520
People exercised in arms and animated by despair to come to battle.

344
00:19:25.740 --> 00:19:29.800
It was a very poor bluff since the goths knew that most of the people in Rome

345
00:19:29.830 --> 00:19:33.750
were too to stand up straight, let alone fight and reply to this threat.

346
00:19:34.070 --> 00:19:37.510
All toted them by saying the thick of the hay, the easier it is mowed.

347
00:19:37.680 --> 00:19:40.910
Eventually some actual negotiations were carried out and an agreement was

348
00:19:40.911 --> 00:19:44.230
reached. Ball received 5,000 pounds of gold, 30,000 pounds of silver,

349
00:19:44.231 --> 00:19:47.630
4,000 silk robs, 3000 pieces of fine cloth and 3000 pounds of pepper.

350
00:19:47.810 --> 00:19:52.020
The vis goths lifted thes return to Tuscany where they made camp for Windsor

351
00:19:52.021 --> 00:19:56.580
during which they even received reinforcement both in the form of escaped slaves

352
00:19:56.581 --> 00:19:59.220
and dramatic soldiers, despite his successes,

353
00:19:59.500 --> 00:20:02.420
all didn't want to spend the rest of his life rating, Roman cities.

354
00:20:02.560 --> 00:20:05.580
So he sent word to Ravina with an offer of peace.

355
00:20:05.800 --> 00:20:09.540
He asked for several Roman provinces to settle plus annual donations of golden

356
00:20:09.730 --> 00:20:12.890
corn. While all would've been made a commander by this point,

357
00:20:12.960 --> 00:20:17.410
Olympians had fallen outta favor at the Roman court replaced by the Pretorian

358
00:20:17.930 --> 00:20:18.770
preface. Jovia who,

359
00:20:19.210 --> 00:20:22.610
although not a friend of the goth sat the sense to realize that they were too

360
00:20:22.770 --> 00:20:25.450
powerful to stop. He encouraged an nos to accept the deal,

361
00:20:25.470 --> 00:20:27.090
but the emperor made a counteroffer.

362
00:20:27.091 --> 00:20:29.170
He agreed to the provinces and the donations,

363
00:20:29.350 --> 00:20:33.680
but refused to bestow any kind of title or honor on ER or any of his family

364
00:20:33.681 --> 00:20:35.120
members, unsurprisingly,

365
00:20:35.220 --> 00:20:37.440
the king of the Bissy GOs considered this a great insult.

366
00:20:37.460 --> 00:20:39.800
So he sat out for Rome once again on his way there,

367
00:20:39.820 --> 00:20:42.600
he had a change of heart and instead Besie the port city of Austria,

368
00:20:42.810 --> 00:20:46.400
which little means to defend itself against a path alarm and fell within days

369
00:20:46.401 --> 00:20:48.840
afterwards, Anne Eric placed a blockade on the port,

370
00:20:49.160 --> 00:20:51.160
thus stopping crucial food shipments to other cities.

371
00:20:51.340 --> 00:20:53.480
He renewed his offer ever improving the terms.

372
00:20:53.860 --> 00:20:58.760
Now he just wanted the province of nor and just a donation of corn. Nevermind.

373
00:20:59.000 --> 00:21:01.400
The gold, this offer was also refused. And in fact,

374
00:21:02.000 --> 00:21:05.440
ans made all his close officials swear and oath that they would never deal with

375
00:21:05.441 --> 00:21:06.274
the vis off king

376
00:21:12.640 --> 00:21:16.510
Since there was no dealing with on Orus all had a new strategy.

377
00:21:17.270 --> 00:21:19.230
Usurp is throne, therefore in 409 80,

378
00:21:19.330 --> 00:21:21.550
he again be proceeded Rome instead of starving them.

379
00:21:21.551 --> 00:21:23.630
This time he led an embassy into the city,

380
00:21:23.940 --> 00:21:28.860
went to the Senate and told them to declare AFE named Pritzkers Atlas as the new

381
00:21:29.020 --> 00:21:31.940
emperor, since the senators were partly in a position to refuse,

382
00:21:32.010 --> 00:21:35.860
they did as instructed and Atlas was named the new emperor of the Western Roman

383
00:21:36.140 --> 00:21:37.540
M empire. His reign was brief though,

384
00:21:37.541 --> 00:21:41.980
as a suit had by remorse as S almost immediately proved himself to be an

385
00:21:42.180 --> 00:21:44.140
arrogant and incompetent lead. After a few months,

386
00:21:44.141 --> 00:21:47.180
he lost the support of ER in the Senate in front of a large crown,

387
00:21:47.240 --> 00:21:51.090
the OV king tripped ATS of his purple robes and his Daddo,

388
00:21:51.180 --> 00:21:55.170
which were his symbols of royalty and send them to an Orus who was hold up in

389
00:21:55.690 --> 00:21:58.170
Ravner in hopes of opening negotiations. Again,

390
00:21:58.390 --> 00:22:02.730
now something strange happens when he was just a few miles from RA all received

391
00:22:02.731 --> 00:22:06.850
words that another Gothic chief day named SARS was at the Empress court.

392
00:22:06.990 --> 00:22:10.880
Not only that, but has men had even attacked one of his forward parties.

393
00:22:11.220 --> 00:22:15.880
The exact reason for SAS's actions are unclear that the point is that he was

394
00:22:16.340 --> 00:22:17.720
A's lifelong enemy.

395
00:22:17.830 --> 00:22:21.920
When the king of the vis gods found that he was working for an Orus and that the

396
00:22:21.921 --> 00:22:23.440
two possibly conspired against him.

397
00:22:23.540 --> 00:22:26.440
He finally abandoned any hope of negotiation. And once again,

398
00:22:26.840 --> 00:22:31.750
Rome had to pay the price for rabbis Folley Al laid see John for

399
00:22:31.790 --> 00:22:32.870
a third and final time.

400
00:22:32.900 --> 00:22:37.310
This one did not last long because somebody opens the Solarian gate for him one

401
00:22:37.311 --> 00:22:39.030
night, therefore on August the 24th,

402
00:22:39.170 --> 00:22:41.750
the goth centered Romans for the first time in 800 years,

403
00:22:41.950 --> 00:22:43.070
the city fell to a foreign enemy.

404
00:22:43.100 --> 00:22:46.070
What followed was three days of looting destruction and murder.

405
00:22:46.350 --> 00:22:48.910
As the goths made off with all the valuables that they could carry.

406
00:22:49.190 --> 00:22:54.100
There is a story shared by the historian. Procop about An's reaction.

407
00:22:54.210 --> 00:22:55.660
When he heard of the sacking of Rome,

408
00:22:55.760 --> 00:23:00.020
one of the emperor's UN entered his James bison told an Aus that Roman perished

409
00:23:00.160 --> 00:23:03.700
the emperor was shocked saying that he had just fed him by hand.

410
00:23:03.920 --> 00:23:07.220
The UN realized that anus thought that one of his favorite roosters who was

411
00:23:07.221 --> 00:23:11.530
named Roman died when the Emper discovered that the servant meant the city of

412
00:23:11.730 --> 00:23:14.090
Rome, not his chicken. He breathed to SI relief.

413
00:23:14.270 --> 00:23:16.330
The story is most likely apocryphal,

414
00:23:16.350 --> 00:23:20.170
but it was indicative of the Roman people's opinion of an or who proved himself

415
00:23:20.171 --> 00:23:22.610
to be both incompetent and completely clueless.

416
00:23:22.640 --> 00:23:25.890
When it came to the actual state of his empire, as for all,

417
00:23:25.950 --> 00:23:27.770
he didn't live long enough to enjoy his PLS up.

418
00:23:27.770 --> 00:23:31.160
He took his goths into Southern Italy with the engine of eventually going to

419
00:23:31.161 --> 00:23:34.040
Africa. However, he was stricken by a short illness and died quickly.

420
00:23:34.110 --> 00:23:35.680
That same year, according to legend,

421
00:23:35.740 --> 00:23:39.160
he was buried in a river bed with all of his greatest treasures where he might

422
00:23:39.161 --> 00:23:39.940
still rest today.

423
00:23:39.940 --> 00:23:43.560
His actions placed the Western room and empire on an unavoidable course of self

424
00:23:43.561 --> 00:23:45.000
destruction. Just decades later,

425
00:23:45.100 --> 00:23:47.480
it would fall and be replaced by many new kingdoms,

426
00:23:47.481 --> 00:23:51.280
including one belonging to the vis goths who would go on to occupy most of the

427
00:23:51.281 --> 00:23:54.840
Iberian peninsula and Southern go. So I really hope you found that video.
