6
00:00:23.960 --> 00:00:24.890
Yeah, it was a question for you.

7
00:00:24.891 --> 00:00:29.060
What would you call a man who spends all day as equally Brown nosing his

8
00:00:29.061 --> 00:00:32.390
superiors as he does bullying of those below him?

9
00:00:32.420 --> 00:00:36.140
The man who swears like a sailor groups, his secretaries,

10
00:00:36.320 --> 00:00:39.380
and is so obsessed with toilet humor that he considers it.

11
00:00:39.530 --> 00:00:43.280
The height of hilarity to make employees watch him urinate.

12
00:00:43.310 --> 00:00:45.980
What'd you call him crude boarish and abuse up,

13
00:00:46.130 --> 00:00:49.280
or what'd you call him a great man, a reformist hero.

14
00:00:49.460 --> 00:00:53.180
When talking about the 36th presidents they own, sir is, well,

15
00:00:53.360 --> 00:00:56.300
all of those things born in Texas in 1908,

16
00:00:56.330 --> 00:01:00.980
Lyndon B Johnson was a strange and complex man elevated to the presidency.

17
00:01:00.981 --> 00:01:02.960
Following John F Kennedy's assassination.

18
00:01:03.140 --> 00:01:07.850
Johnson was notorious for treating those around him like trash mere decoration

19
00:01:07.851 --> 00:01:09.650
to his relentless pursuit of power.

20
00:01:09.740 --> 00:01:14.510
He bullied staffers exposed himself to colleagues and emotionally abused

21
00:01:14.511 --> 00:01:15.321
everyone. Yet.

22
00:01:15.321 --> 00:01:18.560
He was also the president who forced through the civil rights and voting rights

23
00:01:18.561 --> 00:01:23.510
act and did segregation and reinforce HIZ millions of nonwhite Americans,

24
00:01:23.570 --> 00:01:27.020
both an ogre and a Saint, a monster, and a man.

25
00:01:27.170 --> 00:01:30.440
This is the fascinating tale of Lyndon Johnson.

26
00:01:30.710 --> 00:01:32.630
America's most complicated. President.

27
00:01:39.350 --> 00:01:39.380
<v 1>[Inaudible].</v>

28
00:01:39.380 --> 00:01:42.680
<v 0>And Lyndon Baines Johnson was born on the 27th of August, 1908.</v>

29
00:01:42.950 --> 00:01:46.760
There was almost no bigger backwater of in Texas Hill country.

30
00:01:46.820 --> 00:01:48.020
The first of five children,

31
00:01:48.320 --> 00:01:51.770
Johns and grew up in a house with no electricity in a world in which indoor

32
00:01:51.771 --> 00:01:54.860
plumbing was probably slang for genitalia.

33
00:01:54.920 --> 00:01:58.340
But while the family lived in circumstances, best described as humble,

34
00:01:58.610 --> 00:02:02.090
they weren't nobody's Johnson's father Sam Eley Johnson Jr.

35
00:02:02.091 --> 00:02:05.780
Was a one-time member of the state house of representatives among his ancestors.

36
00:02:05.810 --> 00:02:09.560
Sam could count both Texas revolutionaries and Confederate soldiers,

37
00:02:09.590 --> 00:02:12.710
but Sam was also a dreamer with little head for business.

38
00:02:12.740 --> 00:02:16.700
By the time Johnson was born downtown already sent the family into depths with

39
00:02:16.701 --> 00:02:18.200
cotton market speculation.

40
00:02:18.440 --> 00:02:22.700
The indignity of being from an educated family on hard times seems to have

41
00:02:22.730 --> 00:02:26.360
seeped its way into Johnson's soul for his entire life.

42
00:02:26.361 --> 00:02:31.010
The 36th presidents would be ultimately morose and prickly about what

43
00:02:31.011 --> 00:02:32.360
happened to his daddy.

44
00:02:32.570 --> 00:02:35.660
Still the family's fortunes recovered enough that in 1913,

45
00:02:35.661 --> 00:02:38.630
Sam was able to move into a bigger house in Johnson city,

46
00:02:38.900 --> 00:02:43.790
but this was only an improvement in Texas Hill country terms Johnson still had

47
00:02:43.791 --> 00:02:47.270
to ride a mule three miles to his one room school, each date, yes,

48
00:02:47.330 --> 00:02:51.260
even at this early age, the boy was getting a taste for politics. In 1918,

49
00:02:51.261 --> 00:02:55.040
Sam decided to run for his old seat in the Texas house of representatives.

50
00:02:55.220 --> 00:02:59.380
He brought his boy along on the campaign aged only 10 Johnson got his first at

51
00:02:59.381 --> 00:03:02.950
the rough and tumble world of electoral politics. When his daddy won,

52
00:03:03.130 --> 00:03:06.370
it made a big impact and there's a wall after the boy told his classmates,

53
00:03:06.580 --> 00:03:07.090
you know,

54
00:03:07.090 --> 00:03:11.410
someday I'm going to be president of the United States by the early 1920s.

55
00:03:11.411 --> 00:03:15.790
The now teenage Johnson was sitting in on legislative sessions watching Sam

56
00:03:15.791 --> 00:03:16.300
work.

57
00:03:16.300 --> 00:03:20.680
Unfortunately the early twenties was also when the U S plunged into its sharpest

58
00:03:20.681 --> 00:03:25.030
recession. Yet Sam who reinvested in cotton, lost everything.

59
00:03:25.390 --> 00:03:26.200
Again,

60
00:03:26.200 --> 00:03:30.010
Johnson would like to say that he decided then and there that I was not going to

61
00:03:30.011 --> 00:03:31.180
be the victim of a system,

62
00:03:31.210 --> 00:03:35.290
which would allow the price of a commodity like cotton to drop and destroy the

63
00:03:35.291 --> 00:03:38.350
homes of people like my own family. However,

64
00:03:38.410 --> 00:03:42.100
he did very little to actually escape the system. In 1924,

65
00:03:42.101 --> 00:03:46.600
Johnson graduated as president of a six pupil class and applied to Southwest

66
00:03:46.601 --> 00:03:51.280
Texas state teacher's college only to be rejected and see his life grind to a

67
00:03:51.281 --> 00:03:55.540
miserable Holt. By now, the boy had grown into a huge man of six foot,

68
00:03:55.541 --> 00:03:57.910
three inches. He weighed 200 pounds.

69
00:03:58.030 --> 00:03:59.980
So when he responded to his college rejection,

70
00:03:59.981 --> 00:04:04.870
by turning to drinking and fighting a better believe that he'd caused a ruckus

71
00:04:04.960 --> 00:04:08.260
arrested after a brutal Johnson left Texas in business,

72
00:04:08.261 --> 00:04:11.440
buying a car with five friends and heading to California,

73
00:04:11.890 --> 00:04:15.580
but he felt a little better in the sunshine state where he failed to make any

74
00:04:15.581 --> 00:04:19.690
friends. He was just too set and that people were looking down on him.

75
00:04:19.750 --> 00:04:22.270
Not physically. That would have been difficult, especially for,

76
00:04:22.271 --> 00:04:26.500
as rural backgrounds is vulgar ways for the rest of his life.

77
00:04:26.530 --> 00:04:30.820
Johnson would never escape his insecurities about who he was and where he came

78
00:04:30.821 --> 00:04:34.900
from. After three aimless years, Johnson reapplied for college in 1927.

79
00:04:34.960 --> 00:04:38.110
This time he was accepted and began studying to be a teacher.

80
00:04:38.200 --> 00:04:39.070
As part of his training,

81
00:04:39.071 --> 00:04:42.670
he was assigned to a Mexican-American school in Cotulla Texas.

82
00:04:42.820 --> 00:04:46.090
What he saw there would shake the bits of John's to his core.

83
00:04:46.270 --> 00:04:49.330
The school was a dump. The children lived in poverty. So grinding,

84
00:04:49.331 --> 00:04:53.170
it made Johnson's own upbringing seem positively luxurious.

85
00:04:53.470 --> 00:04:56.590
It wasn't long after that, that Johnson made a crucial decision,

86
00:04:56.950 --> 00:05:00.550
forget teaching. He was going to go into politics,

87
00:05:07.470 --> 00:05:08.970
31 Sam's political friend.

88
00:05:08.971 --> 00:05:12.870
Richard Kleberg announced that he would run for Congress Johnson already looking

89
00:05:12.871 --> 00:05:16.110
for ways out of the teaching Wells quit to help with the campaign.

90
00:05:16.170 --> 00:05:20.490
This move kickstarted his career after Kleberg one Texas's 14th congressional

91
00:05:20.940 --> 00:05:24.660
district. He invited Johnson to accompany him to Washington, DC Johnson.

92
00:05:24.690 --> 00:05:26.580
Didn't so much grass, but this opportunity,

93
00:05:26.790 --> 00:05:31.740
as he did pull it into a gigantic bag and wrestle it to the ground for the

94
00:05:31.741 --> 00:05:32.431
next two years,

95
00:05:32.431 --> 00:05:36.390
Johnson spent every waking moment learning the ropes on Capitol Hill.

96
00:05:36.570 --> 00:05:39.240
The sense of power seems to have intoxicated him.

97
00:05:39.300 --> 00:05:43.770
He barely slept instead digging deep into congressional protocol and furiously

98
00:05:43.830 --> 00:05:48.240
sucking up to anyone and everyone. This included fellow Texan,

99
00:05:48.300 --> 00:05:49.290
Sam radon,

100
00:05:49.410 --> 00:05:52.890
while there was their shed origin that drew Johnson and Rayburn together,

101
00:05:53.040 --> 00:05:56.910
it was Ray-Ban's connections to the establishment that kept the young man

102
00:05:56.960 --> 00:05:59.990
hanging on his every word in no time at all,

103
00:06:00.020 --> 00:06:02.690
this friendship would pay Johnson dividends,

104
00:06:02.720 --> 00:06:06.230
but not before it made some major changes to his private life.

105
00:06:06.290 --> 00:06:10.340
When Johnson announced in 1934, that he was going to marry Claudia altar Taylor,

106
00:06:10.580 --> 00:06:12.950
better known by her childhood nickname, Ladybird,

107
00:06:13.160 --> 00:06:15.590
it must have caused a few raised eyebrows.

108
00:06:15.650 --> 00:06:18.500
Johnson was notorious for having an overactive sex drive.

109
00:06:18.530 --> 00:06:21.080
How his friends must have wondered. Was Johnson going to keep,

110
00:06:21.260 --> 00:06:23.540
as Johnson talked away from marriage,

111
00:06:23.660 --> 00:06:27.470
the simple answer was that he wasn't throughout his married life.

112
00:06:27.500 --> 00:06:31.220
Johnson would cheat on lady bird with a frequency as regular as it was

113
00:06:31.221 --> 00:06:34.970
depressing. Not the Johnson's bad behavior did any damage to his career.

114
00:06:35.180 --> 00:06:39.770
Under Sam Rayburn's wing Johnson began to shine when FDRs new deal set up a

115
00:06:39.771 --> 00:06:43.490
national youth administration in every state to provide jobs and educate the

116
00:06:43.491 --> 00:06:47.420
young, right then ensured his protege became the Texas direct app,

117
00:06:47.450 --> 00:06:51.380
but don't do thinking Johnson's only skill was his commitment to licking

118
00:06:51.800 --> 00:06:51.880
everything,

119
00:06:51.880 --> 00:06:56.020
but that crossed his path as Texas national youth administration director.

120
00:06:56.860 --> 00:06:58.840
Jonathan did a Sterling job for two years.

121
00:06:58.870 --> 00:07:02.590
He puts in heart attack inducing hours to make sure that his program

122
00:07:03.370 --> 00:07:06.610
over-performed ever since he had witnessed real poverty in the Katurah school,

123
00:07:06.730 --> 00:07:10.180
Johnson had felt a kinship with America's dispossessed.

124
00:07:10.300 --> 00:07:12.340
He may have been a power hungry home dog,

125
00:07:12.370 --> 00:07:16.210
but he was also one that wanted to help by February,

126
00:07:16.210 --> 00:07:18.550
1937 Johnson's work had made him famous in Texas.

127
00:07:18.580 --> 00:07:22.780
So when a special election was held in his home district, Johnson was a shoo-in.

128
00:07:22.900 --> 00:07:27.040
He convinced lady bird to sing $10,000 of her own inheritance into his campaign,

129
00:07:27.160 --> 00:07:30.040
which is about $180,000 in today's money.

130
00:07:30.220 --> 00:07:33.040
And he promoted himself as a supporter of the new deal.

131
00:07:33.130 --> 00:07:35.860
The election was a cakewalk that year, age,

132
00:07:35.890 --> 00:07:40.480
just 28 Johnson returned to the house, no longer an aide, but a representative.

133
00:07:40.630 --> 00:07:44.260
One of his first victories was finally bringing electricity to Texas Hill

134
00:07:44.261 --> 00:07:45.910
country until the day he died,

135
00:07:46.060 --> 00:07:50.500
Johnson would insist that that was his greatest achievements, but Johnson,

136
00:07:50.501 --> 00:07:53.890
wasn't happy to stop at a seat in the house in 1941,

137
00:07:53.891 --> 00:07:57.640
Texas Senator Maurice shepherd and his replacement. Andrew Jackson, Houston,

138
00:07:57.820 --> 00:08:02.740
both obligingly died. Leaving. See it wide open Johnson declared had run for it,

139
00:08:02.860 --> 00:08:07.000
certain that he was going to win. But this time he was going to meet his match.

140
00:08:07.060 --> 00:08:11.590
W Lee Pappy O'Daniel was Texas as populist governor and a

141
00:08:11.591 --> 00:08:12.790
stunning weasel.

142
00:08:12.910 --> 00:08:16.810
When Johnson dabbled in voter fraud during the primary happy to responded by

143
00:08:16.811 --> 00:08:21.250
pulling off fraudulent voting on a breathtaking scale, unable to compete.

144
00:08:21.370 --> 00:08:23.080
Johnson was forced to watch in horror.

145
00:08:23.081 --> 00:08:27.190
As the Senate seat he felt was his birthright just slipped through his fingers.

146
00:08:27.280 --> 00:08:28.600
In the aftermath of his defeat.

147
00:08:28.601 --> 00:08:31.840
Johnson pulled some strings and had himself made a Lieutenant commander in the

148
00:08:31.841 --> 00:08:35.020
Navy. Maybe he wanted to bolster his public image.

149
00:08:35.200 --> 00:08:39.970
Maybe he just wanted to shake off the bitter taste of losing. Unfortunately,

150
00:08:40.060 --> 00:08:43.780
that Navy was bound to be dragged into the biggest war in history.

151
00:08:43.930 --> 00:08:45.430
But before we get into that, well,

152
00:08:45.431 --> 00:08:47.830

and let's get back to today's video.

177
00:10:11.990 --> 00:10:12.380
<v 3>[Inaudible].</v>

178
00:10:12.380 --> 00:10:13.220
<v 0>The day he died,</v>

179
00:10:13.340 --> 00:10:17.780
Lyndon Johnson would proudly wear his silver stop awarded in 1942.

180
00:10:17.781 --> 00:10:19.900
It showed that it's served under hostile fire.

181
00:10:19.920 --> 00:10:23.120
A distinction marked him out from most of his fellow congressmen.

182
00:10:23.150 --> 00:10:27.200
What it didn't show was that it only ever flown a single mission while hundreds

183
00:10:27.201 --> 00:10:30.440
of thousands of others were sent off to die in the waters of the Pacific

184
00:10:30.470 --> 00:10:33.890
representative, Johnson was able to earn his medal and then be all like, Oh,

185
00:10:33.900 --> 00:10:35.630
that was fun. Bye guys,

186
00:10:36.170 --> 00:10:39.140
metals assigned DOR was good for Johnson in other ways as well.

187
00:10:39.260 --> 00:10:43.520
He shrewdly invested in new war technologies, turning a substantial profits.

188
00:10:43.550 --> 00:10:47.360
By the time he returned to Congress, he was wealthy and he was decorated,

189
00:10:47.630 --> 00:10:49.700
but he was also precarious.

190
00:10:49.910 --> 00:10:53.120
And the aftermath of the war Johnson ran for his sixth house term.

191
00:10:53.330 --> 00:10:55.460
Although we won, he was shaken up by the way,

192
00:10:55.580 --> 00:10:59.870
his opponents painted him as a war profiteer. Who'd got rich while others died.

193
00:11:00.050 --> 00:11:03.890
If his career was going to continue, it needed to escape the house fast.

194
00:11:04.220 --> 00:11:08.570
Luckily, an opportunity. It was bound to present itself in the summer of 1948.

195
00:11:08.571 --> 00:11:11.330
One of Texas's, two Senate seats, again, fell empty.

196
00:11:11.510 --> 00:11:15.050
The front runner for it was Coke Stevenson and a man. So beloved in Texas,

197
00:11:15.051 --> 00:11:18.350
that he was literally known as Mr. Texas,

198
00:11:18.410 --> 00:11:21.470
but Johnson had learned his lesson from his earlier failed Senate bit.

199
00:11:21.530 --> 00:11:24.980
This don't him. He would get that seat no matter what to say.

200
00:11:24.981 --> 00:11:29.300
Johnson bleed dirty would be an insult to debt. He engaged in voter fraud.

201
00:11:29.301 --> 00:11:32.330
So massive. It could probably be seen from space.

202
00:11:32.510 --> 00:11:35.570
There's even a rumor that he tried to paint Stevens. And as someone,

203
00:11:35.571 --> 00:11:38.900
a little too friendly with his pet pics,

204
00:11:38.960 --> 00:11:42.170
but it was the voter fraud that carried the day three extremely suspicious

205
00:11:42.171 --> 00:11:42.561
tallies.

206
00:11:42.561 --> 00:11:46.970
At the last minute swung the race Johnson won by 87 votes out of nearly a

207
00:11:46.971 --> 00:11:51.770
million cost. He also won himself the ironic nickname, landslide, Lyndon,

208
00:11:51.860 --> 00:11:53.030
but what did Johnson care?

209
00:11:53.410 --> 00:11:58.180
It set his sights on a Senate seat and he'd won it nor was he content to

210
00:11:58.181 --> 00:12:01.660
stop that. And no time at all, Lyndon Johnson was going to rise so fast.

211
00:12:01.661 --> 00:12:06.460
Even Lyndon Johnson would be surprised and things got rolling in 1950

212
00:12:06.580 --> 00:12:07.960
that year, the Republicans toppled,

213
00:12:07.990 --> 00:12:11.800
many of the Democrat old guard in the Senate with a senior's gone Johnson was

214
00:12:11.801 --> 00:12:14.140
able to get promoted to democratic whip.

215
00:12:14.290 --> 00:12:18.850
This meant he was perfectly poised when the 1952 election felt even more senior

216
00:12:18.851 --> 00:12:23.560
Democrats in the aftermath, the Democrats made Lyndon Johnson minority leader.

217
00:12:23.620 --> 00:12:26.830
The upshots when the Democrats took the sentence in 1954,

218
00:12:27.040 --> 00:12:31.240
Johnson aged only 46 automatically became majority leader.

219
00:12:31.480 --> 00:12:33.970
The youngest person to hold the role in history.

220
00:12:34.030 --> 00:12:36.220
But almost as soon as he reached the top of the Senate,

221
00:12:36.430 --> 00:12:39.670
Johnson almost lost everything in mid 1955,

222
00:12:39.700 --> 00:12:42.250
the chronic smoker suffered a heart attack. So massive.

223
00:12:42.251 --> 00:12:45.430
It was described as the worst man could have and still live.

224
00:12:45.820 --> 00:12:49.150
And the Optum health Johnson was confined to his house for months where he fell

225
00:12:49.151 --> 00:12:50.170
into a deep depression.

226
00:12:50.350 --> 00:12:53.740
Those who knew him say that he spent those black months wondering what would

227
00:12:53.741 --> 00:12:56.860
have happened if it died, what is a bittery would have said?

228
00:12:57.100 --> 00:12:59.680
And he came to a terrifying conclusion. It would say,

229
00:13:00.250 --> 00:13:04.390
here's a man who wants to power for power's sake and to got what he wanted.

230
00:13:04.660 --> 00:13:08.560
He did nothing for anyone else. And as soon, no one will remember him.

231
00:13:08.980 --> 00:13:13.150
When Johnson finally returned to work, he was a changed man. He quit smoking,

232
00:13:13.180 --> 00:13:14.560
started trying to lose weight,

233
00:13:14.590 --> 00:13:18.250
but the changes were more than superficial from that long Johnson would no

234
00:13:18.251 --> 00:13:20.230
longer pursue power merely for power sake.

235
00:13:20.380 --> 00:13:24.520
It would use it to change the way people saw him to change the way that they

236
00:13:24.521 --> 00:13:28.090
would remember him in doing so. It would also change history.

237
00:13:34.380 --> 00:13:37.830
Most of Johnson's Senate career reads like a cross between an inspirational

238
00:13:37.860 --> 00:13:42.180
lifetime TV movie and the arrest record of Harvey Weinstein.

239
00:13:42.240 --> 00:13:46.080
If Johnson had already had a reputation as a bully, as Senate majority leader,

240
00:13:46.260 --> 00:13:47.850
he was a thousand times worse.

241
00:13:47.940 --> 00:13:51.540
He liked to force his secretaries to take notes while he urinated occasionally

242
00:13:51.541 --> 00:13:53.220
showing them as Oregon and declaring.

243
00:13:53.490 --> 00:13:56.160
Have you ever seen anything as big as this?

244
00:13:56.220 --> 00:13:59.880
He scratched his private parts while speaking on the Senate floor threatens

245
00:13:59.970 --> 00:14:02.430
those who stood in his way. Speaking of threats,

246
00:14:02.460 --> 00:14:05.640
Senate Democrats soon learned to fear the Johnson treatments,

247
00:14:05.880 --> 00:14:09.060
anyone who might break ranks was taken to one side there.

248
00:14:09.061 --> 00:14:12.810
This John's of a man would trap them in a corner and repeatedly jotted them in

249
00:14:12.811 --> 00:14:13.830
the chest with his finger,

250
00:14:13.980 --> 00:14:17.820
threatening them with worse and worse fates until they finally cracked.

251
00:14:17.970 --> 00:14:22.350
It was unpleasant. It was unacceptable. And it was also effective under Johnson.

252
00:14:22.350 --> 00:14:26.190
The Senate Democrats became the United army and Johnson used this military

253
00:14:26.191 --> 00:14:30.600
discipline to do undeniably great things where there's old benzo, Sam Raven.

254
00:14:30.630 --> 00:14:32.910
Now speaker of the house Johnson pushed three bills.

255
00:14:32.911 --> 00:14:36.990
Most Democrats would have previously never dreamed of voting for in 1950,

256
00:14:36.991 --> 00:14:39.420
74 through Eisenhower's civil rights act.

257
00:14:39.450 --> 00:14:42.840
The first civil rights legislation passed since reconstruction,

258
00:14:42.900 --> 00:14:45.650
while Eisenhower was the driving force, passing the bill,

259
00:14:45.720 --> 00:14:47.880
it would have been impossible without Johnson.

260
00:14:47.970 --> 00:14:52.220
He was able to Sue the fears of his fellow southerners. When that didn't work,

261
00:14:52.221 --> 00:14:54.320
he simply brow beat them into submission.

262
00:14:54.410 --> 00:14:59.000
By 1960 Johnson's reputation in the Senate had grown so vast that he felt

263
00:14:59.001 --> 00:15:02.000
confident enough to take part in the democratic primaries.

264
00:15:02.120 --> 00:15:06.440
His only serious opponent was some Catholic green horn from Massachusetts.

265
00:15:06.560 --> 00:15:09.620
You can always imagine Johnson giving a snot of laughter,

266
00:15:10.280 --> 00:15:13.730
a Catholic leading the Democrats. This was going to be easy,

267
00:15:14.030 --> 00:15:16.700
but of course Johnson had miscalculated.

268
00:15:17.150 --> 00:15:21.050
John Fitzgerald Kennedy may have been both Catholic and young,

269
00:15:21.200 --> 00:15:25.730
but he was anything but green JFK absolutely crushed the

270
00:15:25.731 --> 00:15:29.240
primary Johnson whose plan had involved, not actively campaigning,

271
00:15:29.241 --> 00:15:31.700
but simply hoovering up delegates. Thanks to his Senate.

272
00:15:31.701 --> 00:15:35.570
Reputation was left eating the young man's dust come summer.

273
00:15:35.571 --> 00:15:39.380
The telegenic Senator from Massachusetts was his party's candidates.

274
00:15:39.500 --> 00:15:42.170
Almost an afterthought. JFK offered Johnson,

275
00:15:42.230 --> 00:15:46.250
the VP place on his ticket to everyone's amazement Johnson said, yes.

276
00:15:46.520 --> 00:15:49.610
It turns out to be a shrewd move on both of their parts,

277
00:15:49.730 --> 00:15:52.370
despite his disappointments and not being top of the tickets.

278
00:15:52.550 --> 00:15:55.820
Johnson campaigns like hell in the South,

279
00:15:55.970 --> 00:15:59.180
his presence calm the Democrats skittish about Kennedy's Northern roots.

280
00:15:59.390 --> 00:16:04.010
It made all the difference that November JFK won the presidency by the closest

281
00:16:04.370 --> 00:16:08.030
margin since 1916, just edging out Nixon in the popular vote,

282
00:16:08.090 --> 00:16:11.210
but a win is a win. And in January of 1961,

283
00:16:11.211 --> 00:16:13.910
Johnson became vice president of the United States.

284
00:16:14.210 --> 00:16:16.850
It was an exercise in bitter disappointments.

285
00:16:17.000 --> 00:16:20.630
Although Kennedy gave Johnson important roles in the space program and military

286
00:16:20.631 --> 00:16:24.350
policy, he kept the loud mouth texts him firmly out of his inner circle.

287
00:16:24.410 --> 00:16:27.020
All of Johnson's insecurities came bubbling back up.

288
00:16:27.170 --> 00:16:31.580
He envied Kennedy's slick Chon rage that his own Southern backgrounds meant that

289
00:16:31.610 --> 00:16:33.410
he was looked down on. He wasn't wrong.

290
00:16:33.440 --> 00:16:36.530
Bobby Kennedy openly regarded him as an uncouth hick,

291
00:16:36.680 --> 00:16:41.600
but Johnson was also frustrated that his decades of congressional experience one

292
00:16:41.601 --> 00:16:46.220
being put to use when JFK introduced a sweeping civil rights bill in 1963,

293
00:16:46.340 --> 00:16:50.510
it stagnated precisely because Kennedy was unwilling to engage in the kind of

294
00:16:50.810 --> 00:16:54.980
horse trading that Johnson was so adept at by that November Lyndon Johnson was

295
00:16:54.981 --> 00:16:59.750
frustrated, disillusions and likely unsure what future he had left.

296
00:16:59.840 --> 00:17:02.060
As he traveled to his home state with the presidency.

297
00:17:02.600 --> 00:17:06.290
Might've wondered if he would ever fulfill his dream of being a great man of

298
00:17:06.291 --> 00:17:10.520
history, of being remembered. Well, he needed needn't have worried.

299
00:17:11.060 --> 00:17:15.200
Fate was about to throw him a helping hands in the bloodiest most tragic way

300
00:17:15.230 --> 00:17:16.063
possible.

301
00:17:22.000 --> 00:17:26.530
Lyndon Johnson's life changed forever at 12:30 PM on November the 22nd,

302
00:17:26.560 --> 00:17:27.610
1963,

303
00:17:27.670 --> 00:17:31.630
the vice president was riding just to cause behind as Kennedy was shot.

304
00:17:31.840 --> 00:17:33.610
By the time Johnson reached the hospital,

305
00:17:33.790 --> 00:17:38.110
the president had been pronounced dead barely two hours later, 2:38 PM.

306
00:17:38.260 --> 00:17:40.780
Johnson took the oath of office on board air force,

307
00:17:40.781 --> 00:17:42.820
one lady and Jacqueline Kennedy,

308
00:17:42.970 --> 00:17:46.570
where his side below in the cargo holds of the remains of John Fitzgerald.

309
00:17:46.571 --> 00:17:49.210
Kennedy waited to be flown back to Washington.

310
00:17:49.500 --> 00:17:52.500
That same afternoon Johnson gave his first speeches presidents.

311
00:17:52.950 --> 00:17:57.090
I will do my best. He told the shock nation. That is all I can do.

312
00:17:57.480 --> 00:18:01.050
The days that followed were a maelstrom of confusion on November the 24th,

313
00:18:01.350 --> 00:18:04.740
Jack Ruby killed Lee Harvey Oswald that same day Johnson appointed the Warren

314
00:18:04.741 --> 00:18:08.280
commission to investigate behind the scenes. Two things were in turmoil.

315
00:18:08.310 --> 00:18:10.740
Johnson chose not to replace any of JFK's cabinet.

316
00:18:10.741 --> 00:18:13.410
It's giving the grieving nation a sense of continuity,

317
00:18:13.440 --> 00:18:14.760
but there was still the weird,

318
00:18:14.820 --> 00:18:19.320
uncomfortable drama of moving Jackie and the family out of the white house and

319
00:18:19.530 --> 00:18:23.730
Johnson and lady bird in one adviser said that the site of JFK's rocking jab

320
00:18:23.740 --> 00:18:27.420
being taken out just as Johnson's cowboy saddle was brought in,

321
00:18:27.570 --> 00:18:30.810
made him comprehends the enormity of what had happens. Yes.

322
00:18:30.811 --> 00:18:32.040
In the midst of the crisis,

323
00:18:32.160 --> 00:18:36.390
Johnson's political cunning did not desert him Southern Democrats that stalled

324
00:18:36.770 --> 00:18:38.640
Kennedy's civil rights bill to the point of killing it.

325
00:18:38.820 --> 00:18:42.750
But Johnson realized that we're depending on the act on the memory of the slain

326
00:18:43.290 --> 00:18:45.960
presidents, no one would dare oppose it in a heated debate.

327
00:18:45.990 --> 00:18:47.370
During the early hours of November,

328
00:18:47.371 --> 00:18:50.430
the 27th Jonathan's advisors begged him not to do it,

329
00:18:50.610 --> 00:18:55.350
not to squander his Goodwill as JFK successor on rights for Negroes. Well,

330
00:18:55.410 --> 00:18:59.970
what the hell is the presidency for Johnson replied? And that was that,

331
00:19:00.180 --> 00:19:04.410
that same winds up Johnson reframed the civil rights act as Kennedy's legacy.

332
00:19:04.650 --> 00:19:09.240
He began pushing it forward daring Congress to stand against him that spring

333
00:19:09.270 --> 00:19:14.040
1964, the house passed a version of the act, even stronger than what JFK had.

334
00:19:14.041 --> 00:19:18.510
Envisaged Southern Democrats were horrified and like Johnson staff.

335
00:19:18.690 --> 00:19:21.750
It was election year, civil rights. We're a vote to loser.

336
00:19:22.200 --> 00:19:24.000
Why not wait until after November,

337
00:19:24.270 --> 00:19:27.000
but Johnson knew it was now or never over the next few months,

338
00:19:27.030 --> 00:19:30.330
Johnson hammered away at the Senate rather than play it safe.

339
00:19:30.390 --> 00:19:35.100
He chased down every Boston and made sure that he got his vote.

340
00:19:35.220 --> 00:19:38.880
As a Southern Senator later said we could have beaten John Kennedy on civil

341
00:19:38.881 --> 00:19:42.450
rights, but not Lyndon Johnson or more accurately,

342
00:19:42.480 --> 00:19:46.950
not Lyndon Johnson who was cynically brilliantly using Kennedy's memory to get

343
00:19:46.951 --> 00:19:49.650
what he wanted. I'd lost following a near record,

344
00:19:49.680 --> 00:19:51.690
83 day filibuster by southerners.

345
00:19:51.691 --> 00:19:54.900
The bill cleared the Senate on July the second, 1964,

346
00:19:54.901 --> 00:19:57.360
Lyndon B Johnson sat down in front of an audience,

347
00:19:57.361 --> 00:20:00.450
including luminaries like Martin Luther King and signs.

348
00:20:00.451 --> 00:20:02.010
The civil rights act into law.

349
00:20:02.100 --> 00:20:05.790
The most significant piece of legislation passed in post-war America.

350
00:20:06.000 --> 00:20:07.860
The civil rights act ended Jim Crow,

351
00:20:07.861 --> 00:20:12.750
segregation and the rights of employers to discriminate on grounds of race while

352
00:20:12.751 --> 00:20:16.140
racism would still, in fact, many parts of us society,

353
00:20:16.380 --> 00:20:18.270
it was a massive step in the right direction.

354
00:20:18.480 --> 00:20:22.230
Basically that day Johnson remarks to an eight. It is an important game,

355
00:20:22.410 --> 00:20:26.730
but I think we just delivered the South to the Republican party for a long time

356
00:20:26.731 --> 00:20:27.930
to come yet.

357
00:20:27.990 --> 00:20:32.100
He still signs the bill despite knowing it would huddle his potty display to

358
00:20:32.101 --> 00:20:36.030
knowing it would cost him reelection. That right there. That is why,

359
00:20:36.180 --> 00:20:38.730
despite all the bullying, all the nastiness,

360
00:20:38.820 --> 00:20:42.150
there are still people who respect the 36th president.

361
00:20:47.930 --> 00:20:48.550
<v 5>[Inaudible].</v>

362
00:20:48.550 --> 00:20:49.210
<v 0>In the ends.</v>

363
00:20:49.210 --> 00:20:52.300
The civil rights act didn't have Johnson's re-election Johnson at all.

364
00:20:52.540 --> 00:20:55.840
There aren't ligans made the mistake of nominating Barry Goldwater.

365
00:20:55.841 --> 00:21:00.100
A guy is so right-wing the Democrats easily painted him as a trigger.

366
00:21:00.101 --> 00:21:03.760
Happy extremist that November Johnson won the presidency with

367
00:21:03.761 --> 00:21:06.250
61% of the popular vote.

368
00:21:06.400 --> 00:21:10.900
Still the highest margin in history Johnson took his landslide as a

369
00:21:10.901 --> 00:21:14.290
mandate to transform the country. He declared a war on poverty,

370
00:21:14.410 --> 00:21:16.480
increased welfare, established Medicaid,

371
00:21:16.481 --> 00:21:19.930
and Medicare began the headstart program in schools appointed the first African

372
00:21:20.470 --> 00:21:22.960
Americans to both the U S cabinet and the Supreme court.

373
00:21:23.140 --> 00:21:27.730
He built new homes and granted huge tracks of wilderness, federal protection.

374
00:21:27.850 --> 00:21:29.470
As far as Johnson was concerned,

375
00:21:29.471 --> 00:21:32.650
he was picking up where the new deal left off creating,

376
00:21:32.980 --> 00:21:34.870
which he called the great society.

377
00:21:35.080 --> 00:21:38.950
Some of it like head start is still widely used today. Yeah.

378
00:21:38.951 --> 00:21:42.100
While it would be social programs that built his legacy in his era,

379
00:21:42.130 --> 00:21:46.240
Johnson would be known for two things, war and race relations.

380
00:21:46.540 --> 00:21:49.600
And let's start with race relations. Just like the civil rights act.

381
00:21:49.601 --> 00:21:52.450
A whole bunch of Southern States were still doing what they could to keep

382
00:21:52.480 --> 00:21:56.440
nonwhite people from participating in democracy on a state level.

383
00:21:56.470 --> 00:21:59.680
This often played out with ridiculous voter registration laws,

384
00:21:59.681 --> 00:22:04.450
which used the fig leaf of literacy tests to disenfranchise millions of

385
00:22:04.451 --> 00:22:05.470
black Americans.

386
00:22:05.560 --> 00:22:10.090
So Johnson did what Johnson did best using his gigantic frame and uncouth

387
00:22:10.091 --> 00:22:12.370
personality as a weapon. He bullied,

388
00:22:12.460 --> 00:22:17.230
pressured and brow beat Congress into passing the 1965 voting rights act

389
00:22:17.470 --> 00:22:19.420
as one slightly hyperbolic source it.

390
00:22:19.540 --> 00:22:22.300
Abraham Lincoln struck off the chains of black Americans.

391
00:22:22.570 --> 00:22:25.930
It was Johnson who led them into the voting booths. Of course,

392
00:22:25.960 --> 00:22:28.750
this telling ignores all the black activists on the ground,

393
00:22:28.751 --> 00:22:32.350
doing the hardest work of all and getting the bruises to show for it.

394
00:22:32.590 --> 00:22:37.410
Bruises because Johnson's presidency was plagued by race rots over for

395
00:22:37.430 --> 00:22:40.480
long hot summers from 1965 to 1968.

396
00:22:40.600 --> 00:22:44.290
Race rights exploded everywhere from LA to Ohio,

397
00:22:44.500 --> 00:22:45.640
to Washington DC.

398
00:22:45.730 --> 00:22:49.120
When Johnson set up the national advisory commission on civil disorders,

399
00:22:49.150 --> 00:22:52.930
they returned with a stark warning. Thanks to decades of inequality.

400
00:22:53.080 --> 00:22:55.840
America was in danger of dividing into two societies,

401
00:22:55.900 --> 00:22:59.470
one white and one black for the pro civil rights Johnson.

402
00:22:59.500 --> 00:23:03.790
This was a polling news, but if racial tensions were running high in the cities,

403
00:23:04.090 --> 00:23:07.540
things were even worse abroad. After swearing on the campaign trail,

404
00:23:07.541 --> 00:23:09.820
not to increase the U S presence in Vietnam.

405
00:23:09.970 --> 00:23:14.650
Johnson opened his first full term with a massive influx of soldiers and bombing

406
00:23:14.651 --> 00:23:16.360
raids. By 1968,

407
00:23:16.530 --> 00:23:19.900
over half a million us servicemen would be in Vietnam in a conflict that would

408
00:23:20.140 --> 00:23:23.380
eventually claim over 58,000 American lives.

409
00:23:23.530 --> 00:23:26.320
And to millions of Vietnamese as the war grew,

410
00:23:26.321 --> 00:23:30.700
Johnson's popularity dropped to eventually plummeting to 40% everywhere.

411
00:23:30.760 --> 00:23:35.290
He went, the president would encounter protesters chanting, Hey, Hey LBJ,

412
00:23:35.650 --> 00:23:39.700
how many kids did you kill today? But while by 1968,

413
00:23:39.730 --> 00:23:42.970
the honeymoon period was definitely over Johnson.

414
00:23:43.150 --> 00:23:45.160
Still wasn't done constitutionally.

415
00:23:45.320 --> 00:23:49.700
He had a right to run for another full time and why not? He was unpopular,

416
00:23:49.820 --> 00:23:53.240
but no more so than Harry Truman had been winded pulled off his surprise,

417
00:23:53.250 --> 00:23:55.160
1948 win, but Johnson,

418
00:23:55.190 --> 00:23:59.150
wasn't going to have a chance to put his legendary campaign skills to the test.

419
00:23:59.390 --> 00:24:02.030
As 1968 dawned, something was about to happen.

420
00:24:02.031 --> 00:24:06.200
That would make his chances of another term sync from unlikely to utterly

421
00:24:06.201 --> 00:24:07.034
impossible

422
00:24:13.090 --> 00:24:16.000
In terms of losing the battle. But winning the propaganda war,

423
00:24:16.240 --> 00:24:20.830
it's hard to think of a more successful campaign than the Tet offensive starting

424
00:24:20.831 --> 00:24:24.460
in January, 1968, the Viet Cong engaged in a whirlwind of chemicals,

425
00:24:24.461 --> 00:24:28.240
the attacks bringing carnage in their week militarily. It was useless.

426
00:24:28.330 --> 00:24:32.290
One estimate puts the North Vietnamese casualties as high as a hundred

427
00:24:32.291 --> 00:24:35.710
thousands, but in terms of optics, Oh boy,

428
00:24:35.890 --> 00:24:37.900
was it ever a winner course on the back foot?

429
00:24:37.901 --> 00:24:41.470
The Johnson white house was left unable to explain the sudden increase in

430
00:24:41.471 --> 00:24:45.100
Americans coming home in body bags and its failure to win a war.

431
00:24:45.430 --> 00:24:48.250
It had said it was almost over that's. Then a month later,

432
00:24:48.280 --> 00:24:51.970
the democratic primary has got underwear and New Hampshire outside challenger,

433
00:24:51.971 --> 00:24:54.640
Eugene McCarthy management at 41% of the vote,

434
00:24:54.641 --> 00:24:57.280
a huge blow to any sitting president by now.

435
00:24:57.310 --> 00:25:00.610
Johnson could barely leave the white house without getting booed or hackles.

436
00:25:00.670 --> 00:25:03.970
Ben Bobby Kennedy announced that he would be entering the race and Johnson

437
00:25:03.971 --> 00:25:06.070
realized that the game was over.

438
00:25:06.340 --> 00:25:11.230
He could have maybe bounced back Truman stall from an unpopular war in 1967

439
00:25:11.231 --> 00:25:15.730
bits. After the Tet offensive, he was toast on March the 31st,

440
00:25:15.731 --> 00:25:19.120
1968. Lyndon B Johnson made a surprise TV announcements,

441
00:25:19.240 --> 00:25:22.690
as well as instructing the military to begin peace talks with North Vietnam.

442
00:25:22.930 --> 00:25:26.830
He declared that he would not seek a second time as president any elation

443
00:25:26.831 --> 00:25:30.940
Democrats felt at Johnson's exit was quickly countered by a series of disasters.

444
00:25:31.000 --> 00:25:34.630
Just days later, Martin Luther King Jr was assassinated in Memphis,

445
00:25:34.720 --> 00:25:37.540
sparking a fresh wave of rotting. Two months off to that.

446
00:25:37.570 --> 00:25:39.910
Bobby Kennedy was shot dead in California.

447
00:25:40.000 --> 00:25:43.690
When the democratic convention finally met in August massive rots and battles

448
00:25:43.691 --> 00:25:47.950
with police all contributed to the feeling of a country's living out of control.

449
00:25:48.040 --> 00:25:48.700
Come November.

450
00:25:48.700 --> 00:25:53.110
The electorate voted for the man who promised law and order Richard Nixon,

451
00:25:53.350 --> 00:25:54.130
Lyndon Johnson,

452
00:25:54.130 --> 00:25:58.060
left office under a cloud of abysmal approval ratings and a recent Republican

453
00:25:58.061 --> 00:26:02.350
landslide. He retired back to his ranch in Texas, but it wasn't a long life.

454
00:26:02.410 --> 00:26:05.530
Post-presidency on January the 22nd, 1973,

455
00:26:05.531 --> 00:26:09.100
Lyndon Johnson died of a heart attack. It was 64 today.

456
00:26:09.101 --> 00:26:11.470
The Lyndon Johnson legacy is a complicated one.

457
00:26:11.680 --> 00:26:15.880
While the similarly unpopular Truman would be reassessed as one of America's

458
00:26:15.881 --> 00:26:20.710
greatest presidents opinion on Johnson still goes up and down like some sort of

459
00:26:20.740 --> 00:26:23.800
demented yo-yo. On the one hand, he was a Prize-winning,

460
00:26:24.350 --> 00:26:27.040
a guy who would slip his hand up a secretary skirt.

461
00:26:27.041 --> 00:26:30.640
He would reduce his staff is to tears and he wasn't afraid of using physical

462
00:26:30.641 --> 00:26:32.080
violence. On the other hand,

463
00:26:32.290 --> 00:26:36.280
he genuinely did care about America's racial minorities in the alternative

464
00:26:36.281 --> 00:26:38.350
universe, where at JFK survives Dallas,

465
00:26:38.380 --> 00:26:41.230
you have a weaker civil rights acts and no voting rights act,

466
00:26:41.231 --> 00:26:43.650
or the legacy of Johnson then is a mixed one,

467
00:26:43.680 --> 00:26:48.540
both truly great and truly awful, depending on which part you're looking at,

468
00:26:48.870 --> 00:26:52.170
but then you couldn't have one without the other. It was Johnson's bad.

469
00:26:52.530 --> 00:26:53.820
Sight is terrible ego.

470
00:26:54.060 --> 00:26:57.420
This drove him to the top that made him desperate to be remembered yet.

471
00:26:57.421 --> 00:27:01.590
It was only thanks to that dark drive that he was eventually able to end Jim

472
00:27:01.591 --> 00:27:04.050
Crow for all this myriad faults.

473
00:27:04.110 --> 00:27:06.960
Lyndon Johnson ends up being that rare beast,

474
00:27:07.230 --> 00:27:11.340
a demonstrably bad man who devoted his life to doing good.

475
00:27:11.940 --> 00:27:14.550
His legacy may be a complex one, but without him,

476
00:27:14.880 --> 00:27:18.540
America would undoubtedly be a worse place than it is today.

477
00:27:19.320 --> 00:27:21.690
