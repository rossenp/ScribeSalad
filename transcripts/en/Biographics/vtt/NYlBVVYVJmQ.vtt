6
00:00:22.580 --> 00:00:24.380
<v 0>On a chilly day in 1955,</v>

7
00:00:24.530 --> 00:00:29.090
an unremarkable scene unfolded in Alabama that would change American history,

8
00:00:29.330 --> 00:00:33.890
a board, a segregated bus seamstress, Rosa parks was told to surrender her seat.

9
00:00:34.070 --> 00:00:35.600
So a white man could sit down.

10
00:00:35.750 --> 00:00:39.370
It was a moments that already played out thousands of times in Montgomery,

11
00:00:39.380 --> 00:00:42.740
a Southern city languishing under racist Jim Crow laws.

12
00:00:42.770 --> 00:00:47.690
But this time things didn't follow the scripts. Rosa parks refused to move.

13
00:00:47.900 --> 00:00:52.010
It was a decision that changed everything removed from the bus and arrested

14
00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:56.300
parks became a lightning rod for the racial tensions crackling through the South

15
00:00:56.540 --> 00:00:58.130
led by Martin Luther King Jr.

16
00:00:58.190 --> 00:01:03.170
Montgomery's black community boycotted the bus company for a staggering 381

17
00:01:03.171 --> 00:01:07.100
days. It was African-American activism on a scale that the U S had never seen.

18
00:01:07.430 --> 00:01:09.470
And it kick-started the civil rights movements.

19
00:01:09.650 --> 00:01:11.720
And it was all down to one woman.

20
00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:16.190
Born had done a Deere of U S race relations park grew up in a world where racism

21
00:01:16.191 --> 00:01:20.210
was just a poisonous fact of life, but rather than keep her head low,

22
00:01:20.450 --> 00:01:24.140
she fought back. Even before she boarded that bus. She was an activist,

23
00:01:24.141 --> 00:01:28.970
a tireless pursuer of justice. Think you already know the real Rosa parks. Well,

24
00:01:29.330 --> 00:01:30.290
we beg to differ.

25
00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:37.130
<v 1>When Rosa.</v>

26
00:01:37.130 --> 00:01:40.850
<v 0>Alex was born Rosa Louise McCauley on February the fourth, 1913,</v>

27
00:01:40.851 --> 00:01:42.350
outside Tuskegee, Alabama.

28
00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:46.070
It was into a time and place designed to make her feel worthless.

29
00:01:46.340 --> 00:01:49.640
Ever since reconstruction, the South had existed under Jim Crow laws,

30
00:01:49.641 --> 00:01:52.910
forcing whites and blacks to inhabit different worlds famously.

31
00:01:52.940 --> 00:01:56.180
This meant African Americans eating at segregated lunch encounters,

32
00:01:56.210 --> 00:01:59.930
drinking at segregated fountains and living in separate communities.

33
00:01:59.990 --> 00:02:03.680
But the discrimination, it went deeper than that in the worlds of parks,

34
00:02:03.710 --> 00:02:07.940
childhood. Why people well, Mr. Or Mrs. Collins or whatever,

35
00:02:07.941 --> 00:02:12.140
while black people were James or Malcolm or Rosa as an

36
00:02:12.950 --> 00:02:12.951
African-American,

37
00:02:12.951 --> 00:02:16.730
you were expected to step off the sidewalk for a white pass and give up your

38
00:02:16.731 --> 00:02:19.220
seat on the bus to never speak back.

39
00:02:19.370 --> 00:02:22.940
Those who refused could find themselves fired from their jobs left permanently,

40
00:02:22.941 --> 00:02:27.620
unable to find work. And that was just in the cities out in the countryside.

41
00:02:27.650 --> 00:02:30.620
Things could get much worse when parks was two years old,

42
00:02:30.621 --> 00:02:33.890
her parents business went under her father left and the mother was forced to

43
00:02:33.891 --> 00:02:37.880
move in with her parents Rose and Sylvester redwoods and railroad pine level.

44
00:02:38.150 --> 00:02:41.900
It was from her grandfather that young Rosa would get a first taste of activism.

45
00:02:42.500 --> 00:02:44.150
Sylvester redwoods had a mixed race backgrounds,

46
00:02:44.151 --> 00:02:45.920
outwardly appearing to be white. It,

47
00:02:46.040 --> 00:02:49.340
his exterior masked a well of trauma as a child,

48
00:02:49.341 --> 00:02:51.290
Edwards had been a slave on a plantation,

49
00:02:51.440 --> 00:02:55.250
had been mistreated even by the lamentable standards of the time refused food

50
00:02:55.251 --> 00:02:57.950
until he nearly starved to death. Now a free man.

51
00:02:58.010 --> 00:03:01.450
He hated whites with a passion refusing to show any difference.

52
00:03:01.690 --> 00:03:04.810
And often sitting out on the porch with a shotgun in his lap,

53
00:03:04.811 --> 00:03:06.970
whenever white folk came nosing around,

54
00:03:07.240 --> 00:03:09.850
it was a defined and admirable attitude.

55
00:03:10.180 --> 00:03:12.370
It was also one that could have gotten him killed.

56
00:03:12.700 --> 00:03:17.290
Jim Crow was also the era of lynchings to 4,400 people.

57
00:03:17.291 --> 00:03:20.710
Three quarters of them African-American were murdered by their white neighbors

58
00:03:21.070 --> 00:03:24.280
for the smallest perceived infractions at their height.

59
00:03:24.310 --> 00:03:28.390
These lynchings took place out in the open attracting huge crowds of smiling

60
00:03:28.391 --> 00:03:32.830
whites who held their children up to get a good look at the mutilation body.

61
00:03:33.250 --> 00:03:35.080
It was murder as a party.

62
00:03:35.530 --> 00:03:39.280
It was a carnival one with a very clear message for black people.

63
00:03:39.760 --> 00:03:42.760
That message you could be next. The same year.

64
00:03:43.150 --> 00:03:44.950
Park's moved in with Sylvester and Rose Edwards.

65
00:03:44.951 --> 00:03:49.900
The KU Klux Klan was reborn in Georgia after four decades lying dormant by

66
00:03:49.901 --> 00:03:53.680
1916, it had spread to Alabama. By the time parks was 10,

67
00:03:53.860 --> 00:03:58.630
it would boast 150,000 members in our home state alone for parks them into

68
00:03:58.631 --> 00:04:01.480
Charles had lived beneath a shadow of violence. As a girl,

69
00:04:01.481 --> 00:04:04.450
she would lie awake at nights. Listening as the KKK, when writing,

70
00:04:04.810 --> 00:04:06.010
she heard the lynchings.

71
00:04:06.160 --> 00:04:09.070
Once she even witnessed the Klan parade ride pasta doorway,

72
00:04:09.071 --> 00:04:12.520
a show of strength of white impunity on that occasion,

73
00:04:12.970 --> 00:04:16.870
Sylvester Edward stood on the porch, shotgun loaded, calm Lisa in the crowd.

74
00:04:17.020 --> 00:04:22.000
Just daring them to try something yet. Despite this backdrop of fear parks,

75
00:04:22.001 --> 00:04:23.650
didn't let herself be intimidated.

76
00:04:23.800 --> 00:04:27.730
There's a great story from when she was a girl of a white boy who shoved her off

77
00:04:27.731 --> 00:04:29.650
the sidewalk, parks calmly stood up,

78
00:04:29.920 --> 00:04:32.740
dusted herself off and then shoved the white boy on his.

79
00:04:34.030 --> 00:04:35.350
[inaudible] then burst into tears.

80
00:04:35.380 --> 00:04:38.320
His mum shriek did Rosa demanding to know why she did that.

81
00:04:38.950 --> 00:04:39.850
Park's comedy replied.

82
00:04:40.030 --> 00:04:43.330
I didn't want to be pushed seeing how I was not bothering him at all.

83
00:04:43.720 --> 00:04:45.760
It's kind of great that even from this early age,

84
00:04:45.790 --> 00:04:50.590
we can see the fire burning and Rosa parks refusal to be a second class citizen,

85
00:04:50.800 --> 00:04:54.220
but make no mistake. It was a hard life on our way to school.

86
00:04:54.221 --> 00:04:56.620
White kids would throw rocks at her during the summers.

87
00:04:56.621 --> 00:04:58.060
She was forced to work all day long,

88
00:04:58.061 --> 00:05:01.540
picking cotton to help a family make ends meet in short Rosa parks.

89
00:05:01.541 --> 00:05:05.740
His only life was just that of another poor black girl suffering under Jim Crow.

90
00:05:05.890 --> 00:05:10.210
But this time the system was going to meet its match rather than let herself be

91
00:05:10.211 --> 00:05:11.110
ground down.

92
00:05:11.530 --> 00:05:15.910
POCs would wind up being the one who helped tear the whole rotten edifice down.

93
00:05:22.290 --> 00:05:22.620
<v 1>[Inaudible].</v>

94
00:05:22.620 --> 00:05:23.520
<v 0>Although she was intelligent,</v>

95
00:05:23.550 --> 00:05:27.090
bad luck conspired to leave at Rosa parks with little in the way of a formal

96
00:05:27.091 --> 00:05:31.380
education, aged 11. She joins Ms. White's industrial school in Montgomery,

97
00:05:31.381 --> 00:05:34.440
which had mostly white teachers and mostly black students.

98
00:05:34.620 --> 00:05:37.350
But even this amount of mixing was too much for the city,

99
00:05:37.351 --> 00:05:38.760
which closed the school down.

100
00:05:38.940 --> 00:05:42.510
Although parks would start again as a new school should soon be forced to drop

101
00:05:42.511 --> 00:05:45.120
out, to care for a dying grandmother and ill mother.

102
00:05:45.210 --> 00:05:46.230
As a result of their new job,

103
00:05:46.231 --> 00:05:49.530
battle parks was able to get this as a seamstress and a chef factory,

104
00:05:49.710 --> 00:05:53.220
still something must've gone, right? Because a year later in 1932,

105
00:05:53.221 --> 00:05:56.440
she was introduced to Raymond Parks, Ababa by train.

106
00:05:56.790 --> 00:06:00.620
Raymond was lacking in formal education, but that didn't mean he was stupid,

107
00:06:00.800 --> 00:06:04.520
always well-dressed and always read up on every subject that matters Raymond's

108
00:06:04.521 --> 00:06:08.360
was sharp as a pin, and he knew it in his spare time.

109
00:06:08.360 --> 00:06:11.180
He organized defense meetings to try and help the Scottsboro boys,

110
00:06:11.210 --> 00:06:12.890
nine African-American teenagers.

111
00:06:12.891 --> 00:06:15.080
Who'd been falsely accused of raping white women.

112
00:06:15.350 --> 00:06:18.680
It was dangerous work and most meetings took place around a table,

113
00:06:18.740 --> 00:06:22.190
heavy with loaded guns, but it was also the coolest thing.

114
00:06:22.250 --> 00:06:26.390
19 year old parks that ever heard Raymond's completely swept her off her feet.

115
00:06:26.510 --> 00:06:29.510
He proposed to her on their second date and before the year it ended,

116
00:06:29.780 --> 00:06:30.620
the two were married.

117
00:06:30.680 --> 00:06:33.710
But if parks had dreamed of getting involved in Raymond's activism,

118
00:06:33.920 --> 00:06:37.250
her dreams would soon be crushed. Raymond's thought it too dangerous.

119
00:06:37.400 --> 00:06:39.830
The whole loss of them might get lynched at any time.

120
00:06:39.890 --> 00:06:43.130
So parks was forbidden from attending the Scottsboro meetings instead of sitting

121
00:06:43.131 --> 00:06:44.240
quietly on the porch,

122
00:06:44.510 --> 00:06:48.020
as the men talked inside still Raymond's was a supportive husband,

123
00:06:48.021 --> 00:06:51.770
encouraging her to, and our high school degree, something she did in 1933.

124
00:06:52.100 --> 00:06:52.850
After that,

125
00:06:52.850 --> 00:06:56.120
it was a series of menial jobs that my significance of which took place on an

126
00:06:56.121 --> 00:06:59.510
army base as it became ever more apparent. There's another war was looming.

127
00:06:59.540 --> 00:07:03.590
The FDR administration issued an order desegregating army bases.

128
00:07:03.650 --> 00:07:06.290
When parks began working as a secretary at Maxwell field,

129
00:07:06.291 --> 00:07:07.550
just outside of Montgomery,

130
00:07:07.700 --> 00:07:11.630
she was shocked at life in a fully integrated environment.

131
00:07:11.750 --> 00:07:15.590
She could sit next to whoever she wanted on the bus eats in a mixed canteen,

132
00:07:15.620 --> 00:07:17.210
have white women serve our coffee.

133
00:07:17.480 --> 00:07:21.950
She later claims you might say Maxwell base opens my eyes to how it could be

134
00:07:22.280 --> 00:07:24.440
yet. The moment she steps off the base every evening,

135
00:07:24.620 --> 00:07:28.670
it was back back to riding in the Negro section of the bus back to being a

136
00:07:29.000 --> 00:07:33.410
second class citizen back to a world where black and always looking over your

137
00:07:33.411 --> 00:07:37.310
shoulder as the decades ticked past and parks turns 30.

138
00:07:37.820 --> 00:07:41.750
Raymond's began to Thor on the idea of his wife doing activist work in 1943,

139
00:07:41.751 --> 00:07:46.460
they both joined the NACP working long hours as volunteers for

140
00:07:46.461 --> 00:07:47.030
parks.

141
00:07:47.030 --> 00:07:51.950
This was a crazy time and AACP charged her with recording racist violence across

142
00:07:51.951 --> 00:07:55.850
Alabama. This meant going out and collecting graphic accounts of beatings,

143
00:07:55.851 --> 00:07:58.280
whippings, and rapes that were doled out by whites.

144
00:07:58.490 --> 00:08:02.930
The most horrific case was the RACI Taylor case in September, 1944,

145
00:08:02.931 --> 00:08:06.590
a married black woman was abducted by a gang of white men who blindfolded her

146
00:08:06.920 --> 00:08:09.890
and took turns sexually assaulting her in the aftermath.

147
00:08:10.250 --> 00:08:13.670
Parks was sent to take a story only to be menaced by the local sheriff the

148
00:08:13.671 --> 00:08:15.560
entire time she was in town.

149
00:08:15.920 --> 00:08:19.040
Although parks succeeded in making racy Taylor national news,

150
00:08:19.100 --> 00:08:20.450
she couldn't change the world.

151
00:08:20.451 --> 00:08:23.930
She lived in an all white jury dismissed the case in five minutes.

152
00:08:23.990 --> 00:08:26.270
Although the names of Taylor's abusers were unknown.

153
00:08:26.660 --> 00:08:28.910
They never faced justice come 1947.

154
00:08:28.911 --> 00:08:32.930
Rosa parks was famous across Alabama as a fiery activist.

155
00:08:33.050 --> 00:08:36.560
She even gave a speech that year, the local NACP convention,

156
00:08:36.680 --> 00:08:38.780
for which she received a standing ovation,

157
00:08:38.990 --> 00:08:42.440
but it wouldn't be her civil rights work that would make parks famous.

158
00:08:42.620 --> 00:08:44.990
It would be a single bus ride.

159
00:08:48.430 --> 00:08:49.263
<v 2>[Inaudible].</v>

160
00:08:52.000 --> 00:08:53.500
<v 0>History of the civil rights movement.</v>

161
00:08:53.501 --> 00:08:58.170
Perhaps no other figure comes as such a petty Dick as James F

162
00:08:58.770 --> 00:09:00.150
like a Montgomery bus driver,

163
00:09:00.180 --> 00:09:03.030
Blake was charged with enforcing segregation on his vehicle.

164
00:09:03.210 --> 00:09:06.620
Also he'd have you believe in reality driving because we're given discretion.

165
00:09:06.621 --> 00:09:08.540
I've uh, how seriously they took the rules.

166
00:09:08.600 --> 00:09:12.650
So while you've got some jobs worth who always made black people surrender their

167
00:09:12.651 --> 00:09:15.320
seats to whites, you also got some who just turned a blind eye,

168
00:09:15.770 --> 00:09:18.500
but not James Blake to those who've written. His boss.

169
00:09:18.530 --> 00:09:21.350
Blake was notorious for being a weapons grade.

170
00:09:22.160 --> 00:09:26.330
He forced black people to come through the front door pay and then made them get

171
00:09:26.331 --> 00:09:28.280
back off again and get back home and buy the red,

172
00:09:28.640 --> 00:09:31.490
or not only that he sometimes drove off as they were making their way to the

173
00:09:31.491 --> 00:09:35.600
back of the bus, leaving them penniless and without a ride in the freezing cold.

174
00:09:35.750 --> 00:09:37.340
So congratulations, James Blake,

175
00:09:37.430 --> 00:09:40.730
you are being discussed on a channel that has made videos on Stalin,

176
00:09:41.060 --> 00:09:45.830
and you're still somehow the pettiest Tyron's that we've ever encountered.

177
00:09:46.100 --> 00:09:46.910
Rosa parks.

178
00:09:46.910 --> 00:09:51.020
Should we had a run in with Blake during her early days as an NACP investigator?

179
00:09:51.350 --> 00:09:53.810
Yeah, 1943. She bought it as bus through the front door,

180
00:09:53.840 --> 00:09:57.380
paid for a ticket and then refuse to get back off and go to the rear door.

181
00:09:57.440 --> 00:10:01.430
The incident ended with Blake grabbing her arm and shouting at her until parks

182
00:10:01.431 --> 00:10:04.280
ran from the bus. Given what we know of Rosa parks today,

183
00:10:04.281 --> 00:10:08.390
it seems odd that she was involved in a separate bus incident 12 years earlier,

184
00:10:08.630 --> 00:10:13.340
but that's only because we're looking at it with hindsight in 1943 or even

185
00:10:13.341 --> 00:10:14.151
1952,

186
00:10:14.151 --> 00:10:18.530
there was no evidence that the spark for civil rights might come from segregated

187
00:10:18.560 --> 00:10:21.440
buses, 1943 parks. It wasn't all like great.

188
00:10:21.440 --> 00:10:23.840
I'm going to do this again in a decade and watch the world change.

189
00:10:24.140 --> 00:10:25.790
It was only in 1953,

190
00:10:25.940 --> 00:10:29.870
the activists started to see the potential for buses to become a powder keg

191
00:10:29.990 --> 00:10:34.760
that's because 1953 was the year Baton Rouge showed what could be done

192
00:10:34.880 --> 00:10:38.750
that June a Southern reversal in busty segregation in the Louisiana Capitol

193
00:10:38.780 --> 00:10:40.910
exploded into direct action.

194
00:10:41.090 --> 00:10:44.450
Black churches organized the neat de boycott of the bus system costing the

195
00:10:44.451 --> 00:10:45.860
company thousands of dollars.

196
00:10:45.980 --> 00:10:48.410
Although the gains made by the end of the book to a few,

197
00:10:48.411 --> 00:10:51.350
they made activists is prick up across the South.

198
00:10:51.440 --> 00:10:53.630
If it could be done in Baton Rouge, why not?

199
00:10:53.660 --> 00:10:56.750
And say Montgomery by now it was clear.

200
00:10:56.780 --> 00:11:00.470
Something was building below the surface of Southern society of volcano.

201
00:11:01.010 --> 00:11:02.870
There was a bound to erupt in 1954,

202
00:11:02.871 --> 00:11:05.360
the Supreme court ruled in Brown and board of education.

203
00:11:05.361 --> 00:11:09.020
That schools must be desegregated while this was a victory.

204
00:11:09.140 --> 00:11:12.320
It was one that was met with immediate backlash just a year later,

205
00:11:12.770 --> 00:11:16.310
14 old Emmett till was lynched in Mississippi for answering back to a white

206
00:11:16.311 --> 00:11:16.760
woman.

207
00:11:16.760 --> 00:11:21.290
Clearly whites were still ready to use violence to keep hold of that privilege.

208
00:11:21.470 --> 00:11:26.000
By now, the Alabama and AACP was already committed to finding a test case,

209
00:11:26.060 --> 00:11:27.260
the bus desegregation.

210
00:11:27.440 --> 00:11:31.400
They nearly succeeded in November when teenage Claudette Colvin refused to give

211
00:11:31.401 --> 00:11:34.610
up her seat to a white person and was arrested and roughed up.

212
00:11:34.760 --> 00:11:39.140
But NACP discovered she was both pregnant and unmarried and decided not to

213
00:11:39.141 --> 00:11:40.040
pursue the case,

214
00:11:40.100 --> 00:11:43.430
knowing the broadsides that would be launched against whoever had it into the

215
00:11:43.431 --> 00:11:44.061
test case.

216
00:11:44.061 --> 00:11:47.840
They simply couldn't risk using someone without a spotless reputation.

217
00:11:48.050 --> 00:11:51.680
Another near miss was Jo Ann Robinson and educator from home Marie not long

218
00:11:51.710 --> 00:11:55.420
after the Claudette Colvin Robinson got on the bus and deliberately sat in a

219
00:11:55.421 --> 00:11:56.470
whites only seat.

220
00:11:56.710 --> 00:12:00.610
It seems that she was trying to spark a confrontation in order to get arrested.

221
00:12:00.640 --> 00:12:02.830
But when the driver started screaming and swearing at her,

222
00:12:03.100 --> 00:12:06.520
her nose broke and she left the bus. And so December, 1955,

223
00:12:06.521 --> 00:12:10.120
arrived with the activist community, still waiting for the spark,

224
00:12:10.210 --> 00:12:14.470
still waiting for the test case that would give them their shot to blow Jim Crow

225
00:12:14.471 --> 00:12:18.700
wide open. Fortunately, Rosa parks was about to become that very spark. Now,

226
00:12:18.730 --> 00:12:20.350
just before we continue with today's video,

227

243
00:13:19.350 --> 00:13:19.710
<v 3>[Inaudible].</v>

244
00:13:19.710 --> 00:13:23.520
<v 0>1955 Was a chilly day in Montgomery. It was also a busy day.</v>

245
00:13:23.521 --> 00:13:25.950
At least if your name was Rosa parks by now,

246
00:13:26.310 --> 00:13:27.690
parks was working in a department store,

247
00:13:27.691 --> 00:13:29.730
fixing dresses with Christmas approaching.

248
00:13:29.731 --> 00:13:33.690
It was already a busy time and parks had a NACP work on top of that.

249
00:13:33.750 --> 00:13:38.190
She spends her entire coffee break making NACB calls into lunch hour meeting

250
00:13:38.191 --> 00:13:42.030
with a lawyer to discuss a case. By the time she left the building at 5:00 PM,

251
00:13:42.210 --> 00:13:45.540
she was as taught as a dog. The line is a regular bus stop was crazy.

252
00:13:45.541 --> 00:13:47.670
So she ran some errands. By the time she came back,

253
00:13:47.790 --> 00:13:50.460
the queue had thinned out a little Abbas, pulled up POCs,

254
00:13:50.461 --> 00:13:53.790
got on and took a seat beside an African-American man in the middle section,

255
00:13:53.791 --> 00:13:57.360
known as no man's land. These were the un-designated seats,

256
00:13:57.361 --> 00:14:00.990
the ones theoretically reserved for neither whites nor blacks in practice

257
00:14:00.991 --> 00:14:01.141
though,

258
00:14:01.141 --> 00:14:04.470
the drivers would often eject blank people from these rows when whites were

259
00:14:04.471 --> 00:14:06.750
forced to stand, this was especially the case.

260
00:14:06.750 --> 00:14:09.420
If the driver happened to be a bit of an Epic Dick,

261
00:14:09.510 --> 00:14:13.350
and can you catch guests who the Epic Dick driving Rose's boss that day was

262
00:14:15.330 --> 00:14:17.490
as the bus moved on and it got busy up two more blank.

263
00:14:17.510 --> 00:14:19.470
People came to sit in the same row as parks.

264
00:14:19.650 --> 00:14:23.310
Eventually the bus was so full that a white man was forced to stamps it's.

265
00:14:23.311 --> 00:14:26.700
At this point that James Blake did what James Blake did best.

266
00:14:26.730 --> 00:14:27.800
The driver came to the road.

267
00:14:28.080 --> 00:14:32.160
Parks was sat on and told all four black people to move. When everyone refused,

268
00:14:32.250 --> 00:14:34.200
he threatened to call the cops one by one,

269
00:14:34.201 --> 00:14:38.370
the other three really stood up and went to the back. But not Rosa.

270
00:14:38.610 --> 00:14:39.420
Instead of leaving,

271
00:14:39.420 --> 00:14:43.260
she slid across to the window showing she had no intention of moving to this

272
00:14:43.261 --> 00:14:45.480
day. It's onset. And what was going through our head,

273
00:14:45.570 --> 00:14:48.840
the Reverend Jesse Jackson ones claims that she was thinking of Paul lynched,

274
00:14:48.870 --> 00:14:51.920
Emmett till Rosa said, she thought about going to the back of the bus,

275
00:14:51.980 --> 00:14:54.740
but then she thought about Emmett till, and she couldn't do it.

276
00:14:54.920 --> 00:14:57.800
The popular story is that she was just tired from work,

277
00:14:57.801 --> 00:14:59.840
from being treated like garbage.

278
00:15:00.050 --> 00:15:04.160
And other view is the parks was all too aware that the NACB needed its test case

279
00:15:04.460 --> 00:15:09.290
and had decided that it would be her Blake auditor to get up. But parks refused.

280
00:15:09.500 --> 00:15:13.430
He threatened to call the police to which she calmly replied. You may do that.

281
00:15:13.640 --> 00:15:16.640
So Blake did, what's interesting is that the policeman, which is,

282
00:15:16.650 --> 00:15:19.970
does unhappy with Blake's Bulletproofers everybody else.

283
00:15:20.000 --> 00:15:22.010
They tried to diffuse the situation,

284
00:15:22.011 --> 00:15:23.960
but when neither Blake nor parks would budge,

285
00:15:23.990 --> 00:15:28.070
they reluctantly led Rosa parks away. Parks later said they asked her,

286
00:15:28.430 --> 00:15:31.610
why didn't you just stand up? I don't know. She replied.

287
00:15:32.060 --> 00:15:36.290
Why do you push us around? I don't know the laws, the law, after that,

288
00:15:36.350 --> 00:15:40.340
it was a trip to the local jail that parks use telephone goal to notify Raymond

289
00:15:40.490 --> 00:15:43.850
who freaked out terrified should be assaulted in a cell, but no, all the,

290
00:15:44.230 --> 00:15:47.600
and was the parks was fingerprinted and then spent the nights behind bars

291
00:15:48.230 --> 00:15:52.520
actually slept though the wheels were already turning through Raymond's NACP and

292
00:15:52.521 --> 00:15:55.040
other groups found out about the arrest across the nights.

293
00:15:55.040 --> 00:15:59.060
And 35,000 flyers were distributed across Montgomery's black communities calling

294
00:15:59.061 --> 00:16:02.120
for a bus boycott. Children brought the flyers home from school.

295
00:16:02.480 --> 00:16:05.630
Black churches urged their congregations to boycott the buses that Monday.

296
00:16:05.660 --> 00:16:09.290
One of the preachers doing that urging was a 26 year old called Martin Luther

297
00:16:09.291 --> 00:16:12.560
King, Jr. Newman town, and virtually unknown. Even in Alabama,

298
00:16:12.590 --> 00:16:15.830
Dr. King had no intentions of becoming a household name yet.

299
00:16:15.860 --> 00:16:20.630
The stage was now set for his own dizzying rise to prominence by Sunday evening,

300
00:16:20.660 --> 00:16:24.280
the citizens of Montgomery were ready as he went to bed that night. And okay,

301
00:16:24.300 --> 00:16:26.840
confided that had considered the boy boycott a success.

302
00:16:26.930 --> 00:16:30.410
If only 60% of black writers participated this all,

303
00:16:30.411 --> 00:16:33.830
could he have known that the real figure would exceed his wildest dreams?

304
00:16:40.390 --> 00:16:40.810
<v 1>On Monday.</v>

305
00:16:40.810 --> 00:16:43.540
<v 0>December the fifth, 1955, Rosa parks went on trial.</v>

306
00:16:43.570 --> 00:16:48.220
The proceedings were fairly undramatic box was fined $10 and ordered to pay $4

307
00:16:48.221 --> 00:16:51.550
in court costs a pretty small sum. Even at 1955,

308
00:16:51.610 --> 00:16:54.610
the real action was happening outside that morning.

309
00:16:54.611 --> 00:16:57.370
Dr. King has a way you can do a jaw dropping site.

310
00:16:57.460 --> 00:17:01.330
Nearly all the buses in Montgomery's black areas were empty far from stopping at

311
00:17:01.331 --> 00:17:05.290
60% of ride. As the boycott had pulled in nearly a hundred percent.

312
00:17:05.500 --> 00:17:09.490
And so began the most legendary boycott in us history for

313
00:17:09.491 --> 00:17:11.020
381 days.

314
00:17:11.680 --> 00:17:15.640
Montgomery's black citizens avoided the buses using creative means to get to and

315
00:17:15.641 --> 00:17:19.960
from work. At first cabs judged African-American ride is only 10 cents,

316
00:17:19.961 --> 00:17:24.040
but the city passed. Despiteful more forcing them to charge a minimum of 45.

317
00:17:24.220 --> 00:17:27.040
So the black community organized a community taxi system,

318
00:17:27.041 --> 00:17:31.180
which made scheduled rides around town acting sort of like a backup bus.

319
00:17:31.300 --> 00:17:35.080
But while the boycott effected the whole of Montgomery, it affected Rosa parks.

320
00:17:35.081 --> 00:17:37.930
Most of all, usually when the story of parks is told,

321
00:17:37.931 --> 00:17:41.500
it stops with a refusing to get off the bus and then skip straight to that

322
00:17:41.501 --> 00:17:44.920
famous photo of her riding an integrated bus after the boycotts.

323
00:17:45.220 --> 00:17:50.070
There's a good reason for that Rose's life. During the boycott, it was, I work,

324
00:17:50.100 --> 00:17:52.740
none of our black colleagues would talk to her less.

325
00:17:52.741 --> 00:17:54.660
They got reputations as troublemakers.

326
00:17:54.720 --> 00:17:58.770
She was fired for her activism in January, 1956. At the same time,

327
00:17:58.771 --> 00:18:02.460
Raymond's work brought in a new rule, forbidding people to discuss Rosa parks.

328
00:18:02.760 --> 00:18:06.090
So he quit in disgust, penniless and unable to find new work.

329
00:18:06.210 --> 00:18:10.380
The two were then left, traumatized by slander and death threats. First,

330
00:18:10.530 --> 00:18:12.810
the slander barely had the boycott started.

331
00:18:12.811 --> 00:18:15.270
Then fake news started crawling out of the woodwork.

332
00:18:15.330 --> 00:18:19.290
Segregationists said anything they could about POCs that she was a communist,

333
00:18:19.291 --> 00:18:20.700
that she was factually Mexican,

334
00:18:20.910 --> 00:18:25.020
that she had a car and didn't even need to ride a bus. It was the same old crap.

335
00:18:25.021 --> 00:18:29.700
You still see today to the messenger. So you don't have to hear the message.

336
00:18:29.790 --> 00:18:31.170
But in 1955,

337
00:18:31.171 --> 00:18:34.770
some people went further parks and Raymond started receiving death threats,

338
00:18:34.771 --> 00:18:37.980
a steady stream that caused Raymond to have a minor breakdown.

339
00:18:38.100 --> 00:18:39.390
Then on January the 30th,

340
00:18:39.450 --> 00:18:42.720
the segregationist bombed Martin Luther King's home while his children were

341
00:18:42.721 --> 00:18:44.730
inside. Luckily no one was hurt.

342
00:18:44.731 --> 00:18:49.230
And MLK used that act of violence to advance his message of peaceful protest

343
00:18:49.260 --> 00:18:52.770
telling supporters. I want you to love our enemies. Be good to them,

344
00:18:53.010 --> 00:18:57.360
love them and let them know that you loved them, but parks wasn't some Saint,

345
00:18:57.420 --> 00:19:01.440
she was just a regular woman and the violence terrified her nor was that test

346
00:19:01.441 --> 00:19:02.790
case. Even going ahead,

347
00:19:02.970 --> 00:19:05.550
although parks was the face of the Montgomery bus boycotts,

348
00:19:05.580 --> 00:19:07.590
her case was actually dropped by organizers.

349
00:19:07.591 --> 00:19:10.200
When they realized that they had three better ones,

350
00:19:10.201 --> 00:19:12.180
that they could use all that violence,

351
00:19:12.210 --> 00:19:16.560
all those threats and parks wasn't even part of the lawsuit anymore. Finally,

352
00:19:16.561 --> 00:19:17.790
in November of 1956,

353
00:19:17.791 --> 00:19:21.000
the case made its way before the Supreme court in a major decision,

354
00:19:21.030 --> 00:19:23.490
the justices ruled against segregating buses.

355
00:19:23.700 --> 00:19:26.100
Although the city of Montgomery trying to appeal,

356
00:19:26.430 --> 00:19:30.150
it was refused on December the 20th. Montgomery was issued with a formal paper,

357
00:19:30.151 --> 00:19:34.080
ordering an end to segregation on public transport. The very next day,

358
00:19:34.380 --> 00:19:38.370
the boycott lifted Martin Luther King and Rosa parks, both separately roads.

359
00:19:38.400 --> 00:19:41.850
The new integrated bus system that day parks was even photograph looking

360
00:19:41.851 --> 00:19:42.870
wistfully out the window.

361
00:19:42.871 --> 00:19:47.400
A Wiseman sat behind her to show that the old system was now gone and they'd

362
00:19:47.401 --> 00:19:49.170
done it against all the odds.

363
00:19:49.171 --> 00:19:53.700
One lone protest by Rosa parks had shaken up the whole of Montgomery.

364
00:19:53.760 --> 00:19:57.570
It had shown black people what they could achieve with community action.

365
00:19:57.870 --> 00:20:02.040
It was everything everyone had dreamed of. It was a happy ending.

366
00:20:02.790 --> 00:20:03.623
Wasn't it?

367
00:20:10.040 --> 00:20:10.190
<v 4>[Inaudible].</v>

368
00:20:10.190 --> 00:20:14.300
<v 0>Normally the story of Rosa parks ends out here with Montgomery's bus services</v>

369
00:20:14.301 --> 00:20:16.580
integrated in the civil rights movement, gaining steam,

370
00:20:16.820 --> 00:20:20.660
but sadly life isn't a pre-packaged lifetime movie where the credits roll and

371
00:20:20.661 --> 00:20:23.030
everyone goes skipping off into the sun life.

372
00:20:23.060 --> 00:20:26.930
After the bus boycott was hard for parks and Raymond's unbelievably.

373
00:20:26.931 --> 00:20:29.150
So thanks to Rose's notoriety,

374
00:20:29.180 --> 00:20:31.340
neither of them were able to find work in Alabama.

375
00:20:31.610 --> 00:20:36.050
Even civil rights organizations would entitle them most were run by men who took

376
00:20:36.051 --> 00:20:37.340
one, look at parks and said,

377
00:20:37.670 --> 00:20:42.380
this isn't work for women by 1957 parks couldn't even afford medicine to treat

378
00:20:42.381 --> 00:20:43.190
her stomach ulcers.

379
00:20:43.190 --> 00:20:45.740
She tried moving to Virginia to work at the Hampton Institute,

380
00:20:45.770 --> 00:20:48.910
but they wouldn't give her a lodging. So quits on top of economic worries,

381
00:20:48.940 --> 00:20:52.060
the threats of violence hadn't receded with the boycotts end,

382
00:20:52.480 --> 00:20:56.110
there was a real urgent danger to parks his life so long as she remained in the

383
00:20:56.111 --> 00:20:57.430
South in 1957,

384
00:20:57.431 --> 00:21:00.900
a family convinced her to relocate to Michigan for our own safety. Well,

385
00:21:00.901 --> 00:21:05.160
while that took care of the danger, it didn't take care of the economic side.

386
00:21:05.190 --> 00:21:09.960
One little bit by 1960 jet magazine was describing POCs as a tatted

387
00:21:09.961 --> 00:21:12.240
rag of a form of self penniless.

388
00:21:12.300 --> 00:21:16.410
Detriot an alien with stomach ulcers and a throat tumor compressed into two

389
00:21:16.411 --> 00:21:19.950
rooms with our husband and mother. It was a painfully low point in parks,

390
00:21:20.070 --> 00:21:23.010
his life and undeserved ends. Luckily,

391
00:21:23.011 --> 00:21:26.410
this was also the moment that things began to turn around the lag because he

392
00:21:26.880 --> 00:21:30.780
profile seemed to stir some consciouses. NACB paid off parks, his medical bills,

393
00:21:30.781 --> 00:21:34.680
allowing her to get a cancer operated on shortly after Raymond finally managed

394
00:21:34.681 --> 00:21:37.500
to find work. And soon the couple were back home sound,

395
00:21:37.501 --> 00:21:41.310
financial footing that meant they lived to see Lyndon B Johnson signed the civil

396
00:21:41.311 --> 00:21:43.740
rights act into law. In the summer of 1964,

397
00:21:43.890 --> 00:21:47.640
it meant parks was able to join the campaign to get John corners elected to

398
00:21:47.641 --> 00:21:51.510
Congress in Paris, by convincing Martin Luther King to endorse the candidate.

399
00:21:51.510 --> 00:21:53.850
Something King rarely did as a reward.

400
00:21:54.240 --> 00:21:56.910
Connie gave her a salary position in his office. One,

401
00:21:56.970 --> 00:22:00.570
she kept right up until her retirement. Interestingly, by this point,

402
00:22:00.840 --> 00:22:05.010
pox was taught of King's philosophy of nonviolence. Malcolm X was saying,

403
00:22:05.190 --> 00:22:07.380
if we can protect ourselves again, violence,

404
00:22:07.470 --> 00:22:11.310
it's not actually violence in our POS. That's just self protection,

405
00:22:11.460 --> 00:22:15.930
trying to keep from being victimized with violence, sadly parks,

406
00:22:16.170 --> 00:22:20.790
wouldn't have to see both of these icons assassinated Malcolm X in 1965 and MLK

407
00:22:21.060 --> 00:22:24.030
in 1968, 10 years later in 1977,

408
00:22:24.031 --> 00:22:27.450
Raymond died of cancer and suddenly parks was all alone.

409
00:22:27.780 --> 00:22:29.100
So how does this was the park?

410
00:22:29.220 --> 00:22:33.060
I also lived long enough to see yourself transformed into an icon right into the

411
00:22:33.061 --> 00:22:36.600
late 1970s. She was still receiving death threats from segregationists,

412
00:22:37.120 --> 00:22:41.940
but at some point the tide began to turn and things began to change. In 1996,

413
00:22:41.941 --> 00:22:44.850
she was awarded the essential medal of freedom by a white president.

414
00:22:44.850 --> 00:22:48.540
Who'd grown up in the segregated South three years later in 1999,

415
00:22:48.541 --> 00:22:50.670
she was also awarded the congressional gold medal.

416
00:22:50.730 --> 00:22:55.590
By the time parks died on October the 24th, 2005, she was globally famous.

417
00:22:55.770 --> 00:23:00.450
A story was told in textbooks. Kids heard about her in school. After a death,

418
00:23:00.451 --> 00:23:04.080
a body was placed on the road Tundra and Capitol Hills so people could pay their

419
00:23:04.081 --> 00:23:08.280
respects only the second African-American to ever be afforded that honor.

420
00:23:08.610 --> 00:23:11.910
Eight years later, in 2013, a statue of how it was added to the rotunda,

421
00:23:12.090 --> 00:23:16.080
the third statue of black person to ever be placed in the building today.

422
00:23:16.081 --> 00:23:19.380
Rosa parks is no longer a met person. She's an icon.

423
00:23:19.560 --> 00:23:23.610
One who encapsulates an entire era and entice struggle.

424
00:23:23.790 --> 00:23:27.450
Children learn about her. Her name is everywhere on buildings and streets.

425
00:23:27.720 --> 00:23:28.290
And yes,

426
00:23:28.290 --> 00:23:33.240
the real parks is sometimes almost forgotten in telling her tale over and over.

427
00:23:33.240 --> 00:23:36.780
Parks has been reduced in the public consciousness to just a symbol,

428
00:23:37.050 --> 00:23:40.710
easily understandable as the tale of the Tod woman who refused to give up her

429
00:23:40.711 --> 00:23:45.260
seat may be it's important to remember that the sanitized version leaves out

430
00:23:45.590 --> 00:23:46.670
all of the human parts,

431
00:23:46.820 --> 00:23:50.750
that it leaves out the violence parks grew up with the financial misery that she

432
00:23:50.751 --> 00:23:52.730
suffered for holding her grounds,

433
00:23:52.850 --> 00:23:56.510
all the things that would have broken a lesser person it's uncomfortable to hear

434
00:23:56.511 --> 00:23:58.310
because we all like a fairy tale.

435
00:23:58.460 --> 00:24:02.300
We'd all like to believe parks was recognized as a hero from day one,

436
00:24:02.330 --> 00:24:06.290
rather than hearing that taking a stands nearly destroyed her. And yet,

437
00:24:06.620 --> 00:24:10.850
in a way, this bleak aversion just makes that much more inspiring.

438
00:24:11.060 --> 00:24:12.590
Here was someone who wasn't a Saint,

439
00:24:12.591 --> 00:24:16.010
wasn't a tired working woman with sore feet, but an activist,

440
00:24:16.100 --> 00:24:20.210
someone who saw the degradation suffered by the black community and decided she

441
00:24:20.211 --> 00:24:24.800
had to speak out no matter what the consequences by recognizing this darker side

442
00:24:24.801 --> 00:24:25.431
of her story,

443
00:24:25.431 --> 00:24:29.990
hopefully we too can be inspired to do the right thing because as the tale of

444
00:24:29.991 --> 00:24:34.040
Rosa parks proves, one person really can change the world.

445
00:24:34.700 --> 00:24:36.890
