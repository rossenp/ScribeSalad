00:00:20.660 --> 00:00:22.820
Even if you're not a lover of classical music,

6
00:00:22.821 --> 00:00:27.020
you may have felt that first rush of adrenaline at the top of ride of the

7
00:00:27.800 --> 00:00:32.600
Valkyries or shed a tear or two at the first swell of here comes the bride.

8
00:00:32.690 --> 00:00:37.070
These are two among many of the famed compositions of to tase

9
00:00:37.190 --> 00:00:38.030
protagonist.

10
00:00:38.060 --> 00:00:42.290
One of the Titans of music of all ages and all genres.

11
00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:47.270
Rihad Wagner. He's a man who left a Mark, not only on music, but on philosophy,

12
00:00:47.360 --> 00:00:51.680
society and politics of the 19th and 20th centuries. Today,

13
00:00:51.681 --> 00:00:56.240
we will explore his personal life. His main works has controversial views.

14
00:00:56.390 --> 00:00:59.540
Finally, we will address the ultimate question of his legacy,

15
00:00:59.541 --> 00:01:02.840
which tied his music to the propaganda Rapids of the third Reich.

16
00:01:02.870 --> 00:01:06.560
But does he really deserve to be remembered as the soundtrack to an

17
00:01:06.561 --> 00:01:09.350
authoritarian warm mongering regime? Well,

18
00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:14.150
I hope you're sitting comfortably as today's video is suitably Wagnerian in

19
00:01:14.151 --> 00:01:14.984
length.

20
00:01:21.590 --> 00:01:25.340
I recall it Wagner was born on may the 22nd, 18, 13,

21
00:01:25.341 --> 00:01:29.420
and Leipzig is then part of Saxony presently in modern day, Germany.

22
00:01:29.450 --> 00:01:32.240
The city is remembered for its contribution to arts,

23
00:01:32.390 --> 00:01:37.130
literature and music composers like Johann, Sebastian Bach, Wolfgang, Amadeus,

24
00:01:37.131 --> 00:01:37.791
Mozart,

25
00:01:37.791 --> 00:01:42.410
and Felix Mendelssohn all works as organists in the church of Saint

26
00:01:42.440 --> 00:01:46.100
Thomas. The same church where young Rihad was baptized.

27
00:01:46.101 --> 00:01:50.660
So not a bad start for a future giants of music.

28
00:01:50.690 --> 00:01:54.830
Baby Ricard would barely get to meet his father call Friedrich Wagner.

29
00:01:54.831 --> 00:01:59.780
A police clock died in November of 1813 during a typhoid epidemic a year later,

30
00:01:59.990 --> 00:02:04.250
Rick hard's mother Joanna remarried this time taking vows with noted AXA,

31
00:02:04.760 --> 00:02:06.470
painter and poet, Ludovic Maya.

32
00:02:06.650 --> 00:02:11.150
She worked with him in Dresden taking Rihad and his siblings along there is

33
00:02:11.151 --> 00:02:14.270
evidence that Yana and Ludvig had been lovers for a long time.

34
00:02:14.271 --> 00:02:17.780
And that the artist may have actually been Ricard's biological father,

35
00:02:17.810 --> 00:02:18.643
whatever the truth.

36
00:02:18.950 --> 00:02:22.610
Gaia had a strong bonds with Rihad and encouraged him to develop his creative

37
00:02:22.850 --> 00:02:25.010
and artistic site. Unfortunately,

38
00:02:25.011 --> 00:02:29.540
the boy soon lost a second father figure to Ludvig died suddenly on November the

39
00:02:29.541 --> 00:02:30.890
30th, 1821,

40
00:02:30.920 --> 00:02:34.670
but the Wagner has stayed in Dresden for several more years.

41
00:02:34.671 --> 00:02:37.610
During which time Ricard started taking piano lessons,

42
00:02:37.640 --> 00:02:40.970
he gravitated more towards literature that his early teens,

43
00:02:41.120 --> 00:02:45.500
he pens his first work, a five act tragedy called Leopold's and Adelaide.

44
00:02:45.590 --> 00:02:49.790
It was only after a moved back to Leipzig in 1827 that young Wagner started

45
00:02:49.791 --> 00:02:53.330
taking music more seriously. During the second Leipzig tour,

46
00:02:53.360 --> 00:02:56.480
he began taking lessons in harmony and counterpoint.

47
00:02:56.570 --> 00:03:00.970
He also started attending performances from his favorite genre opera,

48
00:03:01.360 --> 00:03:05.200
really hard composed his first serious sonatas and string quartets in the late

49
00:03:05.201 --> 00:03:08.200
1820s encouraged by his natural ability.

50
00:03:08.201 --> 00:03:12.670
His mother Joanna convinced him to enroll at Leipzig university to study musical

51
00:03:12.671 --> 00:03:13.450
composition.

52
00:03:13.450 --> 00:03:18.010
The young composer flourished his piano Sonata in B flat major impressed one of

53
00:03:18.011 --> 00:03:22.180
his teachers so much that he agreed to give him extra lessons for free.

54
00:03:22.330 --> 00:03:25.840
At this stage. Ricard's compositions were small and scale.

55
00:03:25.841 --> 00:03:29.410
If are musically inclined, friends will allow me the term.

56
00:03:29.440 --> 00:03:32.950
What I mean is that he focused on writing string quartets or sonatas

57
00:03:32.951 --> 00:03:36.550
compositions for a single instrument, but in the 1830s,

58
00:03:36.580 --> 00:03:39.070
Wagner began composing orchestral, symphonies,

59
00:03:39.071 --> 00:03:43.390
and even incidental music for a play King and Zeo. This mocked,

60
00:03:43.391 --> 00:03:46.090
his debut in writing for a theatrical production.

61
00:03:46.270 --> 00:03:48.790
As he began collecting his first favorable reviews,

62
00:03:49.330 --> 00:03:53.290
Ricard decided it was time to compose a work and his favorite genre opera,

63
00:03:53.380 --> 00:03:58.180
his inaugural work who has dioxide or the wedding, but it remained in complete.

64
00:03:58.270 --> 00:04:01.990
It'd be forgiven for thinking this was an early sign of writers or well

65
00:04:02.770 --> 00:04:03.340
composer's block,

66
00:04:03.340 --> 00:04:08.050
but a Wagner quickly bounced back with new finished wax between 1833 and 1836.

67
00:04:08.050 --> 00:04:11.290
He composed his first two complete operas.

68
00:04:11.380 --> 00:04:14.830
The first one was titled the fairies in contrast to common practice.

69
00:04:14.831 --> 00:04:19.420
At the time Wagner wrote both the music and the libretto or the text.

70
00:04:19.600 --> 00:04:23.800
It told the story of the love between a fairy princess and the human opposed by

71
00:04:24.010 --> 00:04:25.000
the fairies father.

72
00:04:25.001 --> 00:04:28.630
But unfortunately it was never performed during Wagner's lifetime.

73
00:04:28.870 --> 00:04:30.940
The second go was the ban on love,

74
00:04:30.941 --> 00:04:34.450
a comic opera based on William Shakespeare's measure for measure this time

75
00:04:34.930 --> 00:04:36.670
volunteers work and a stage production,

76
00:04:36.850 --> 00:04:40.000
which promptly flopped after one performance.

77
00:04:40.090 --> 00:04:43.810
So if you ever despair about finding success in this life,

78
00:04:43.811 --> 00:04:48.400
remember this even Wagner totally flunked his first three

79
00:04:48.430 --> 00:04:49.120
operas,

80
00:04:49.120 --> 00:04:53.410
but even these disappointments provided a great opportunity for Wagner to test

81
00:04:53.411 --> 00:04:57.640
and develop his musical and philosophical ideas while writing the fairies.

82
00:04:57.641 --> 00:04:58.810
And it's floppy. You follow up.

83
00:04:58.990 --> 00:05:03.490
Wagner had become friends with Heinrich Lau key figure of the young

84
00:05:03.491 --> 00:05:06.340
Germans literary movements inspired by their ideals.

85
00:05:06.340 --> 00:05:09.850
Wagner started to reject to the values of romantic poetry and music.

86
00:05:10.030 --> 00:05:14.290
That's typical of the early 19th century. Instead he began developing a new,

87
00:05:14.500 --> 00:05:19.360
personal vision imbued with pan German ism and progressive liberal political

88
00:05:19.361 --> 00:05:22.420
thinking derive from the early ideals of the French revolution.

89
00:05:22.600 --> 00:05:25.420
These were political and philosophical sentiments,

90
00:05:25.421 --> 00:05:29.680
which Wagner shared with many more young European intellectuals who were

91
00:05:29.950 --> 00:05:34.270
disappointed by the restoration at the time or hard had started courting

92
00:05:34.271 --> 00:05:38.950
actress, Christine [inaudible] plateau known as MENA together.

93
00:05:39.310 --> 00:05:43.330
They moved to Magda bug and started working with the Beth theatrical company.

94
00:05:43.390 --> 00:05:44.380
It was with this trip.

95
00:05:45.250 --> 00:05:49.150
Wagner had conducted the premiere of his second completed opera of the ban of

96
00:05:49.151 --> 00:05:51.250
love in March, 1836,

97
00:05:51.280 --> 00:05:55.990
the total fiasco that ensued bankrupted Beckman's company and left

98
00:05:56.000 --> 00:06:00.540
Wagner with few professional prospects. Luckily Mina was a planner,

99
00:06:00.770 --> 00:06:03.830
not only in name, she sorted out their next move,

100
00:06:03.831 --> 00:06:08.570
which was a relocation to Koenigsberg now modern day Callan grad on the Baltic

101
00:06:08.571 --> 00:06:09.404
sea. Yeah,

102
00:06:09.410 --> 00:06:13.520
she took a new job at the city's main theater and the two lovers married on the

103
00:06:13.521 --> 00:06:14.360
24th of November.

104
00:06:20.320 --> 00:06:20.770
<v 1>[Inaudible].</v>

105
00:06:20.770 --> 00:06:22.870
<v 0>Very soon after the arrival of the Wagner,</v>

106
00:06:22.990 --> 00:06:27.700
as the counters Berg fitter found itself on a slippery slope towards bankruptcy.

107
00:06:28.180 --> 00:06:30.820
Ricard was also plagued by other troubles may not,

108
00:06:30.880 --> 00:06:35.680
not exactly the faithful sort of wife had eloped with a young lover helps with

109
00:06:35.681 --> 00:06:40.300
Nick came from Heinrich Dorn conductor Ricard knew from his Leipzig days,

110
00:06:40.360 --> 00:06:42.130
Dawn secured a poster's conduct.

111
00:06:42.220 --> 00:06:45.880
If a Wagner wrote to the German theater in Riga in modern day, Lafayette,

112
00:06:45.940 --> 00:06:49.750
this job would give him financial security and maybe even the chance to mend his

113
00:06:49.751 --> 00:06:50.890
relationship with Nina.

114
00:06:50.950 --> 00:06:55.840
The plan works well sort of vulner arrived in Riga in August of

115
00:06:55.841 --> 00:07:00.280
1837. And by early 1838 Mino was again by his side.

116
00:07:00.340 --> 00:07:03.250
The two enjoyed a better quality of life for a short time,

117
00:07:03.251 --> 00:07:07.810
but more problems were not far behind as the couple lived beyond their means.

118
00:07:08.230 --> 00:07:11.260
Debts started to accumulate at the same time. Mina had resumed.

119
00:07:11.261 --> 00:07:15.370
Her infidelity is accepting the courtship of the theater's very director.

120
00:07:15.460 --> 00:07:19.390
In other words, his wife had started dating his boss.

121
00:07:19.420 --> 00:07:23.620
Vonda was also frustrated by the poor quality of the frivolous comedic operas.

122
00:07:23.740 --> 00:07:25.360
It was forced to conduct eventually.

123
00:07:25.420 --> 00:07:29.050
Also this experience proved to be a disappointment in 1838.

124
00:07:29.051 --> 00:07:33.160
The German theater did not renew his contract with debt collectors and literally

125
00:07:33.161 --> 00:07:35.240
pounding on his door on July the 10th,

126
00:07:35.710 --> 00:07:38.980
Ricard dragged MENA to the Harbor and the to escape until they smuggled his

127
00:07:38.981 --> 00:07:42.370
ship. I mean, stay formidable, see store that destination,

128
00:07:42.970 --> 00:07:47.080
or that would be Paris as the ship navigates the waves and wins.

129
00:07:47.110 --> 00:07:50.830
Let's ponder this man's life so far for a 26 year old.

130
00:07:50.950 --> 00:07:53.080
He had achieved some solid success,

131
00:07:53.081 --> 00:07:57.370
but also some catastrophic failure professionally and personally,

132
00:07:57.400 --> 00:07:58.450
and yet in his luggage,

133
00:07:58.451 --> 00:08:02.680
he carried a wealth of experience that he would later put to good use while in

134
00:08:02.681 --> 00:08:05.860
Riga exasperated, by the light nature of musical theater,

135
00:08:06.160 --> 00:08:09.160
he had started writing the libretto for a new work.

136
00:08:09.250 --> 00:08:13.600
This would become the monumental opera or NZ based on a novel by Edward

137
00:08:13.601 --> 00:08:14.434
Bulwer-Lytton.

138
00:08:14.440 --> 00:08:19.030
This is a historical piece about a 14th century Roman leader and just popular

139
00:08:19.300 --> 00:08:23.260
stomp rising during his tenure at the German theater Wagner also develops a new

140
00:08:23.261 --> 00:08:25.990
conducting stones revolutionary in those times,

141
00:08:26.170 --> 00:08:29.040
rather than waving the Baton while facing the audience,

142
00:08:29.230 --> 00:08:33.700
he faced the orchestra to establish a closer connection with the musicians.

143
00:08:33.730 --> 00:08:37.480
Finally, he took careful notes about the architecture of the German theater.

144
00:08:37.690 --> 00:08:40.990
He especially admired the dark auditorium, the simple deco,

145
00:08:40.991 --> 00:08:44.380
the empathy to layout the deep orchestral pits.

146
00:08:44.410 --> 00:08:48.610
These features would all later inspire the construction of his own theater,

147
00:08:48.670 --> 00:08:50.410
but let's not get ahead of ourselves.

148
00:08:50.470 --> 00:08:53.350
The Wagner has landed in France and in September, 1839,

149
00:08:53.351 --> 00:08:56.850
after a torturous journey during Mina had suffered a miscarriage.

150
00:08:56.910 --> 00:08:58.140
This one was a tragic events,

151
00:08:58.141 --> 00:09:02.310
which marked the beginning of another unfortunate period of marital conflict in

152
00:09:02.311 --> 00:09:06.240
Paris. Mina was able to tread the boards now and again,

153
00:09:06.840 --> 00:09:08.580
Rahaed well they're new wooden boards.

154
00:09:08.581 --> 00:09:11.310
He saw with those of the doors slammed on his face.

155
00:09:11.550 --> 00:09:14.100
Apparently Parisians had little interest in his music.

156
00:09:14.610 --> 00:09:17.850
Bogner took a day job completing arrangements for a music publisher,

157
00:09:18.240 --> 00:09:22.350
Wiley hustled to get Renzi on stage an old friend from Leipzig composer,

158
00:09:22.590 --> 00:09:23.490
geo coma, Maya bear.

159
00:09:23.700 --> 00:09:27.300
And to see you do it on Wagner his behalf with the director of the Paris opera,

160
00:09:27.330 --> 00:09:31.470
unfortunately the prison establishment was too conservative to accept the work

161
00:09:31.471 --> 00:09:33.750
of a young unknown German composer.

162
00:09:33.810 --> 00:09:37.530
Undeterred Wagner continued to write and compose completing his next opera.

163
00:09:37.590 --> 00:09:41.050
The flying Dutchman, this opera was inspired and POS well,

164
00:09:41.140 --> 00:09:43.850
a legendary ghost ship, as well as the Wagner. Yeah,

165
00:09:43.970 --> 00:09:48.170
and powerless voyage from Riga musically it's introduced for the first time.

166
00:09:48.171 --> 00:09:50.060
One of Wagner's signature techniques,

167
00:09:50.240 --> 00:09:55.190
the light motif recurring musical theme associated with a specific character

168
00:09:55.191 --> 00:09:56.024
or situation.

169
00:09:56.240 --> 00:10:01.220
The leitmotif concepts has had a major lasting effect on modern and contemporary

170
00:10:01.221 --> 00:10:01.640
music.

171
00:10:01.640 --> 00:10:06.440
Even on film and TV soundtracks consider the Imperial March from star Wars or

172
00:10:06.500 --> 00:10:10.370
the reigns of costuming from game of Thrones to ominous accompaniments,

173
00:10:10.400 --> 00:10:13.340
that sonically acknowledge the presence of series villains.

174
00:10:13.520 --> 00:10:17.120
But back to the 18 hundreds, while Wagner was composing the flying Dutchman,

175
00:10:17.300 --> 00:10:19.310
he had the idea to hustle back home.

176
00:10:19.490 --> 00:10:23.270
He sent a petition to the King of Saxony Friedrich Augustus. The second,

177
00:10:23.480 --> 00:10:28.400
asking him to accept Renzi as a production at the Dresden court theater in

178
00:10:28.401 --> 00:10:32.360
June of 1841, the King accepted more than a year later on July the seventh,

179
00:10:32.390 --> 00:10:33.141
1842,

180
00:10:33.141 --> 00:10:37.880
Richard Amina left Paris to prepare the premiere of Ryan Z considering

181
00:10:37.881 --> 00:10:40.310
Wagner his track record his relative obscurity.

182
00:10:40.311 --> 00:10:43.700
And the fact that the opera was five hours long. Well,

183
00:10:43.701 --> 00:10:47.600
you can probably guess how it went and you would be wrong.

184
00:10:47.630 --> 00:10:49.460
The opera debuted on October the 20th,

185
00:10:50.270 --> 00:10:54.440
1842 and audiences absolutely loved it all five hours.

186
00:10:55.010 --> 00:10:57.800
The year 1846 three took off with another rap shoe.

187
00:10:57.950 --> 00:11:00.200
His debut that of the flying Dutchman,

188
00:11:00.201 --> 00:11:03.440
a piece in which the composer further pushed the boundaries of operatic

189
00:11:04.100 --> 00:11:06.170
convention. These successes groans at Wagner,

190
00:11:06.380 --> 00:11:11.240
a new role as musical director of the Royal court in Dresden with new found

191
00:11:11.241 --> 00:11:15.280
financial stability, the young composer could finally repay as many debts. Well,

192
00:11:15.350 --> 00:11:18.800
it kinds of, he actually just ended up borrowing more money to pay them.

193
00:11:18.801 --> 00:11:20.750
But I mean, who are we to judge? You see,

194
00:11:20.751 --> 00:11:22.820
he had some other concerns to keep him occupied.

195
00:11:22.940 --> 00:11:25.850
This was Europe in the mid 1840s and another age,

196
00:11:25.970 --> 00:11:29.540
the political and philosophical debate was brewing after the post Napoleonic

197
00:11:29.541 --> 00:11:30.374
restoration,

198
00:11:30.650 --> 00:11:35.030
a fuse had been lit under the continent and they spark was gradually burning its

199
00:11:35.031 --> 00:11:39.320
way towards 1840. The age of that bomb of a revolutionary year,

200
00:11:39.590 --> 00:11:41.360
the detonation well it's inevitable.

201
00:11:41.361 --> 00:11:46.010
And the young restless Wagner had already picked aside while working for the

202
00:11:46.011 --> 00:11:49.310
King of Saxony. Wagner continued honing his operatic craft.

203
00:11:49.520 --> 00:11:53.980
The next of his operas do premiere was townhouse or in October of 45.

204
00:11:54.190 --> 00:11:58.390
This work deals with the titular wandering minstrel torn between pagan beliefs

205
00:11:58.480 --> 00:12:01.090
and Christianity between the pleasures of worldly,

206
00:12:01.091 --> 00:12:05.050
passion and spiritual love while developing the libretto for this opera,

207
00:12:05.110 --> 00:12:08.470
Wagner began studying the mythology of German and Nordic law,

208
00:12:08.500 --> 00:12:11.440
which be found to be a gold mine of inspiration.

209
00:12:11.500 --> 00:12:15.100
His favorite writer became medieval permit Wolfram Von Eschenbach,

210
00:12:15.340 --> 00:12:18.880
whose waxy used as a basis for two future operas Parsifal.

211
00:12:18.910 --> 00:12:23.800
And Lohengrin Lohengrin revolves around a mysterious Knight who protects young

212
00:12:23.801 --> 00:12:26.140
Elser against a malicious Reela counts.

213
00:12:26.740 --> 00:12:29.530
Tellerman Volbella completed it in April, 1848,

214
00:12:29.560 --> 00:12:34.300
just when revolution across Europe were rising up against that own malicious

215
00:12:34.780 --> 00:12:38.470
rulers Wagner frequency, the Dresden course while writing these new operas.

216
00:12:38.471 --> 00:12:42.070
But he preferred to mingle with revolutionary activists who shared his

217
00:12:42.071 --> 00:12:46.000
progressive ideals, his desire for a constitutional governments,

218
00:12:46.001 --> 00:12:48.190
or even as yearning for a United Germany.

219
00:12:48.250 --> 00:12:50.440
Most notable amongst them was Augustus.

220
00:12:50.441 --> 00:12:55.060
Rockhold the editor of the radical newspaper, Volks Blatter and Mikhail.

221
00:12:55.750 --> 00:12:58.270
Backronym the founder of collectivist anarchism.

222
00:12:58.390 --> 00:13:02.620
Initially Saxony was not involved in the revolutionary wildfire of 1848,

223
00:13:02.830 --> 00:13:06.460
but after more than a year of quiet descent in may of 1849,

224
00:13:06.461 --> 00:13:08.000
Dresden revolted against its.

225
00:13:14.850 --> 00:13:15.120
<v 1>[Inaudible].</v>

226
00:13:15.120 --> 00:13:16.350
<v 0>Some people took to the streets,</v>

227
00:13:16.380 --> 00:13:19.830
pressing the King to Institute social and electoral reforms.

228
00:13:20.100 --> 00:13:21.810
Wagner was on their site.

229
00:13:21.900 --> 00:13:25.440
He wrote articles against the aristocracy and in favor of a Republican

230
00:13:25.441 --> 00:13:26.274
constitution.

231
00:13:26.640 --> 00:13:30.540
As he personally distributed revolutionary manifestos to the Saxon troops,

232
00:13:30.840 --> 00:13:35.340
eventually he got involved with some of the more serious action and is on may

233
00:13:35.341 --> 00:13:36.570
the seventh, 1949.

234
00:13:36.780 --> 00:13:40.950
Richard Wagner volunteered to spy on troop movements from the top of a church

235
00:13:40.951 --> 00:13:44.100
tower in Dresden. Soon he spotted incoming troops.

236
00:13:44.220 --> 00:13:48.120
The problem was that they spotted him too, and they opened fire.

237
00:13:48.210 --> 00:13:49.920
Luckily for the future of music history,

238
00:13:49.921 --> 00:13:54.000
those unnamed soldiers were bad shots and Wagner escaped in one piece,

239
00:13:54.210 --> 00:13:57.600
but his name had already been compromised by his rebellious articles.

240
00:13:57.750 --> 00:14:01.380
When the uprising eventually failed Zacks and authorities issued an arrest

241
00:14:01.800 --> 00:14:05.790
warrants on may the 16th, but the composer was on a streak of good luck.

242
00:14:05.940 --> 00:14:08.700
The Warren's bore a very vague description of VOC,

243
00:14:08.880 --> 00:14:12.990
nine 37 to 38 years old of medium height with Brown hair and eye glasses.

244
00:14:13.320 --> 00:14:17.070
They might as well have risen a guy somewhere in Europe.

245
00:14:17.220 --> 00:14:20.400
The incompetence of Saxon police allowed Wagner to escape,

246
00:14:20.401 --> 00:14:23.730
Dresden and relocate to Zurich, Switzerland with the help of his friends,

247
00:14:24.000 --> 00:14:28.710
composer Franz Liszt vulner spends the next 12 years in XL from Gemini

248
00:14:28.711 --> 00:14:31.320
running low on morale and even lower on funds.

249
00:14:31.530 --> 00:14:35.220
A group of friends thankfully arranged for him to receive a regular pension to

250
00:14:35.221 --> 00:14:36.300
give him some stability,

251
00:14:36.540 --> 00:14:40.350
except he sabotaged himself by having an affair with one of the wife of said

252
00:14:40.351 --> 00:14:44.670
friends so much for gratitude vog nap during the first years in Switzerland,

253
00:14:44.671 --> 00:14:45.950
the Wagner as well. Again,

254
00:14:45.970 --> 00:14:50.580
unhappy MENA slipped into depression while Rick had suffered from composer's

255
00:14:50.581 --> 00:14:54.800
block, there is such a thing. He did write some essays though. The first one,

256
00:14:54.830 --> 00:14:59.240
the artwork of the future was a visionary work in which he described opera as a

257
00:14:59.270 --> 00:15:03.470
total work of art, which combined music song, dance, poetry, visual arts,

258
00:15:03.471 --> 00:15:04.430
and stagecraft.

259
00:15:04.640 --> 00:15:09.590
The followup published in 1850 was this infamous Judaism and music essay in this

260
00:15:09.591 --> 00:15:13.400
work he expressed publicly for the first time has antisemitic views,

261
00:15:13.401 --> 00:15:15.500
which he held in private throughout his life,

262
00:15:15.530 --> 00:15:19.220
even extending his racial disdain of other nations.

263
00:15:19.430 --> 00:15:23.540
His thesis was that Jews had no connection to the lofty German national spirit

264
00:15:23.541 --> 00:15:27.680
and as such, they were capable of producing only shallow and artificial music.

265
00:15:28.370 --> 00:15:29.300
According to Wagner,

266
00:15:29.330 --> 00:15:34.160
Jewish composers were only seeking popularity and financial success in capable

267
00:15:34.370 --> 00:15:36.200
of conceiving, genuine art.

268
00:15:36.260 --> 00:15:39.320
The Jewish artists could only speak in imitation of others,

269
00:15:39.410 --> 00:15:42.410
make art in imitation of others. He cannot really speak,

270
00:15:42.560 --> 00:15:44.870
write or create art on his own.

271
00:15:45.020 --> 00:15:49.070
It can be argued that a Wagner did have many Jewish friends and the anti-Semitic

272
00:15:49.071 --> 00:15:52.220
views were quite common in Europe at the time. However,

273
00:15:52.250 --> 00:15:53.480
taking the time to write,

274
00:15:53.750 --> 00:15:58.130
edit and publish such views really took the arbitrary hatred of a whole portion

275
00:15:58.131 --> 00:16:01.190
of mankind to well, another level,

276
00:16:01.430 --> 00:16:04.580
then Wagner's musical genius. It can't be denied.

277
00:16:04.790 --> 00:16:09.230
NorCan is drive for innovation in the musical medium while he was working on his

278
00:16:09.231 --> 00:16:10.070
first pamphlets.

279
00:16:10.071 --> 00:16:13.250
The composer had also started working on his best known masterpiece.

280
00:16:13.490 --> 00:16:18.290
The four opera cycle, the ring of NY balloon, or simply is the ring.

281
00:16:18.320 --> 00:16:21.710
This cycle includes the Rhine goals, the Valkyrie Siegfried,

282
00:16:21.830 --> 00:16:23.300
and Twilight of the gods.

283
00:16:23.360 --> 00:16:27.320
The plot is inspired by Nordic mythology and revolves around a magic ring that

284
00:16:27.321 --> 00:16:29.390
can bestow the power to rule the world.

285
00:16:29.600 --> 00:16:34.250
The God Woden steals the ring from its naked as the Naval long dwarf

286
00:16:34.850 --> 00:16:35.150
Albury,

287
00:16:35.150 --> 00:16:39.050
he then hands it over to John's fastener and Faszholz as payment for them

288
00:16:39.051 --> 00:16:43.820
building Valhalla, the town's mortal grandson, the hero secret slaves faff.

289
00:16:44.000 --> 00:16:46.910
Now to retrieve the ring, I need to be killed by Alberich sun.

290
00:16:46.940 --> 00:16:51.500
The Valkyrie Brunhilde secrets lover returns the ring to the Rhine maidens

291
00:16:51.530 --> 00:16:54.800
rightful owners of the gold from which the ring had been forged.

292
00:16:55.010 --> 00:16:59.870
She then commit suicide on secrets funeral part before the gods and Valhalla all

293
00:16:59.871 --> 00:17:01.850
destroyed in the Twilight of the gods.

294
00:17:02.030 --> 00:17:03.680
If you want any more details on the story,

295
00:17:03.681 --> 00:17:07.670
you are welcome to attend the full 15 hour performance.

296
00:17:07.970 --> 00:17:11.000
According to Carol Berger, professor of music at Stanford university,

297
00:17:11.001 --> 00:17:13.100
the ring is an allegory for Wagner.

298
00:17:13.101 --> 00:17:16.550
His political beliefs inspired by his revolutionary experience.

299
00:17:16.610 --> 00:17:20.690
Secrets quest represents a struggle to wrestle power from the hands of

300
00:17:20.691 --> 00:17:25.400
capitalists. That's the goldsmithing dwarves, as well as the aristocracy.

301
00:17:25.550 --> 00:17:27.350
The gods in his lifetime though,

302
00:17:27.500 --> 00:17:30.500
Wagner did not expound on the meaning of the cycle,

303
00:17:30.501 --> 00:17:34.070
but rather on his musical vision in an 1851 publication,

304
00:17:34.071 --> 00:17:38.570
a communication to my friends Wagner described his work as dramas rather than

305
00:17:38.571 --> 00:17:39.140
operas,

306
00:17:39.140 --> 00:17:42.650
they would be performed at especially designed festival over the course of four

307
00:17:42.651 --> 00:17:47.240
consecutive days, allowing audiences to enjoy the cycle in its entirety.

308
00:17:47.300 --> 00:17:48.860
The composition of the ring cycle,

309
00:17:49.320 --> 00:17:53.580
most of Wagner his energies during much of the 1850s by June of 1857,

310
00:17:53.581 --> 00:17:57.540
the composer had written and composed the first two dramas and the first two

311
00:17:57.541 --> 00:18:01.140
acts of secret before setting them aside for another project,

312
00:18:01.170 --> 00:18:04.950
Tristan and Isolde. Now, before we continue with today's very long video,

313
00:18:04.951 --> 00:18:08.430
I'd like to thank Squarespace for making it possible now to simple things.

314
00:18:08.580 --> 00:18:13.020
Maybe you've got some idea for a website or a business or a podcast up here,

315
00:18:13.230 --> 00:18:15.120
and you're thinking I should try that. Well,

316
00:18:15.121 --> 00:18:17.940
the only way to figure out whether it was a good idea is to get it out there to

317
00:18:17.941 --> 00:18:19.800
the world and see if people wants it.

318
00:18:19.801 --> 00:18:22.380
And that can be daunting because people might not want it.

319
00:18:22.381 --> 00:18:26.700
That is a reality of life, but you won't know that until you try.

320
00:18:26.970 --> 00:18:29.160
And the best way to try is to build a great website.

321
00:18:29.160 --> 00:18:31.350
And you can do that with Squarespace.

322
00:18:31.410 --> 00:18:34.530
Squarespace allows you to create a powerful website for whatever you're up to.

Maybe you want to do a YouTube channel. Well, I mean, you do that on YouTube,

326
00:18:45.300 --> 00:18:47.850
but you can get a website to compliment it. That's a nice thing.

or you can start from scratch or you can easily move over an existing domain,

330
00:18:56.641 --> 00:19:00.330
making everything super easy to manage. Don't start from scratch though.

331
00:19:00.630 --> 00:19:03.570
Just use a template. No excuses ends.

332
00:19:03.571 --> 00:19:06.420

<v 0>The plots of Tristan and Isolde borrows from the legends of King Arthur and</v>

344
00:19:49.730 --> 00:19:54.260
Disney inspired by the philosophy of another Arthur Schopenhauer Wagner had

345
00:19:54.261 --> 00:19:58.940
first read Schopenhauer works in 1854 and had become an easy convert to his

346
00:19:58.941 --> 00:20:02.540
philosophy. A deeply pessimistic view of the human condition.

347
00:20:02.660 --> 00:20:05.420
Subject to the whims of blind impulsive will.

348
00:20:05.480 --> 00:20:08.870
This is reflected in the story of the two titular characters.

349
00:20:09.050 --> 00:20:12.320
Their love story is subject to irrational, destructive passion,

350
00:20:12.321 --> 00:20:15.500
which can only end in death shape an hours basis.

351
00:20:15.530 --> 00:20:18.680
Also influenced the balance of drama versus music.

352
00:20:19.370 --> 00:20:22.910
Wagner had earlier theorize that the Plaza dialogue and poetic aspect of an

353
00:20:22.911 --> 00:20:26.600
opera should be preeminence with music in a subservient role.

354
00:20:26.660 --> 00:20:31.160
Schopenhauer suggested that instead music was now the leading passionate,

355
00:20:31.161 --> 00:20:35.630
almost irrational force whose Tanner and tone drove the message to the

356
00:20:35.631 --> 00:20:38.900
audience. Another source of inspiration for Trista Nandi is older,

357
00:20:38.930 --> 00:20:43.500
came from Wagner's own. In fact situation with a married lady, poet, Matilda,

358
00:20:43.520 --> 00:20:45.020
Western doc. Again,

359
00:20:45.050 --> 00:20:48.310
this lady was the wife of one of Ogden's patrons and benefactors.

360
00:20:48.400 --> 00:20:50.230
It must've been a heartfelt affair, but again,

361
00:20:50.231 --> 00:20:54.030
what I am learning here is that do not lend money Doria Wagner for,

362
00:20:54.240 --> 00:20:56.490
he certainly knows how to repay you.

363
00:20:56.550 --> 00:21:00.930
The affair collapsed in 1858 when Mina intercepted a letter to Matilda from Rick

364
00:21:01.170 --> 00:21:03.960
hot from then on the couple was virtually separated,

365
00:21:04.320 --> 00:21:07.830
not returned to Germany while Rick had spent time in Venice from where he

366
00:21:07.831 --> 00:21:09.870
continued his correspondence with Matilda,

367
00:21:10.410 --> 00:21:13.440
Mina and Ricard tried to reconcile some years later in Paris,

368
00:21:14.040 --> 00:21:17.820
Wagner had moved that again to organize a new production of Taane Hauser in

369
00:21:18.720 --> 00:21:22.110
1861. This was a fiasco, his opponents of emperor Napoleon. The third,

370
00:21:22.170 --> 00:21:25.710
it took the occasion to stage protests against his foreign policy beliefs.

371
00:21:25.920 --> 00:21:29.820
The reunion with Mina was similarly, a debacle lends the two parted ways.

372
00:21:29.820 --> 00:21:33.690
Once more in the meantime, things were improving back home and Dresden,

373
00:21:33.750 --> 00:21:35.280
thanks to his friend's friends list.

374
00:21:35.310 --> 00:21:39.480
Productions of Lohengrin and other works by Wagner had become all the rage in

375
00:21:39.481 --> 00:21:41.550
Saxony, his autistic success.

376
00:21:41.640 --> 00:21:44.460
It pressured the government to issue a full pardon for the revolutionary

377
00:21:44.461 --> 00:21:47.400
composer. The King of Saxony waited with open arms,

378
00:21:47.401 --> 00:21:52.200
but Wagner had since set his science on the patronage of another Monarch King

379
00:21:52.201 --> 00:21:56.220
would Vick of Bavaria while still a 15 year old Prince Ludvig had attended a

380
00:21:56.221 --> 00:21:59.580
performance learn, grin rapturous experience,

381
00:21:59.610 --> 00:22:04.050
which had left him in tears known to be eccentric, flamboyant sins, even mad.

382
00:22:04.650 --> 00:22:05.970
Ludvig built a sort of private,

383
00:22:05.971 --> 00:22:10.350
psychological fantasy around the Wagner as imaginary world retreat in which to

384
00:22:10.351 --> 00:22:12.270
escape from the pressures of life.

385
00:22:12.360 --> 00:22:16.800
This can be seen in the fairytale causals he builds such as the astonishing

386
00:22:17.340 --> 00:22:19.680
newfound Stein or the whimsical Lindoff palace,

387
00:22:19.681 --> 00:22:24.510
which came equipped with a golden Swan boat directly inspired by Lohengrin

388
00:22:24.570 --> 00:22:28.320
naturally when Ludvig was crowns King of Bavaria at the age of 18,

389
00:22:28.321 --> 00:22:32.330
one of his first acts was to summon Wagner to his court by may of 1864.

390
00:22:32.720 --> 00:22:34.740
Eckhart had parted ways once and for all with Mina,

391
00:22:34.741 --> 00:22:38.700
although he still supported her financially burying himself into more and more

392
00:22:38.701 --> 00:22:40.470
debt sensing an opportunity.

393
00:22:40.590 --> 00:22:44.760
He eagerly accepted the invitation and then meeting the King enthusiastically

394
00:22:44.761 --> 00:22:49.320
offered to fund any opera. The Maestro wished to stage and Wagner chose Triston.

395
00:22:49.650 --> 00:22:52.770
And his older, he had previously tried to produce it in Vienna,

396
00:22:52.800 --> 00:22:56.640
but the show had never premiere ads as it was deemed too difficult to perform

397
00:22:56.641 --> 00:23:00.570
and do expensive to stage, but the Kings coffers word deep.

398
00:23:00.571 --> 00:23:05.280
So on June the 10th, 1865, the drama premiere yet in Munich,

399
00:23:05.340 --> 00:23:09.660
the conducted for this run was Hamza Von Bulow Hans and his young wife Cosima

400
00:23:09.661 --> 00:23:12.960
had welcomed to the world. That baby daughter also named as older,

401
00:23:12.961 --> 00:23:16.800
just a couple of months earlier. Well, not exactly that or WhatsApp.

402
00:23:17.010 --> 00:23:21.270
The biological father was, well, you guessed it to Mr. Rihad lose pounds.

403
00:23:21.780 --> 00:23:23.250
Wagner casino was herself,

404
00:23:23.280 --> 00:23:27.690
the illegitimate daughter of Franz Liszt who disapproved of her affair with his

405
00:23:27.691 --> 00:23:30.510
friend Wagner. This is just another proof of our theorem.

406
00:23:30.511 --> 00:23:34.080
If you do Wagner a failure, he will do your wife or daughter,

407
00:23:34.440 --> 00:23:39.150
or maybe both DFO or rather the scandal came the talk of Munich at the same

408
00:23:39.151 --> 00:23:39.780
time,

409
00:23:39.780 --> 00:23:43.080
Jonas courtiers were wary of the influence that Wagner had over the King and

410
00:23:43.081 --> 00:23:47.030
started pressuring Louisville to get rid him in December, 1865.

411
00:23:47.420 --> 00:23:50.960
Ludovic was finally forced to ask the composer to leave Munich, the King,

412
00:23:51.050 --> 00:23:53.990
even considered obligating to follow his arrow into XR,

413
00:23:54.140 --> 00:23:57.840
but Wagner convinced him to remain on the throne during a second Swiss acts,

414
00:23:58.460 --> 00:24:00.740
Salvagnini took time to revise and expand his pamphlet.

415
00:24:00.800 --> 00:24:04.250
Judaism in music publishing the new version in 1869.

416
00:24:04.310 --> 00:24:07.790
This time that received wider circulation and reaction than the previous

417
00:24:07.791 --> 00:24:11.570
edition, even causing mass protests, that the performances of his new work,

418
00:24:11.571 --> 00:24:13.940
the master singers of Nierenberg. In the meantime,

419
00:24:13.941 --> 00:24:18.050
he had been living in sin with Cassina siren, two children, Eva,

420
00:24:18.080 --> 00:24:21.380
and secret two eventually married in August of 1870.

421
00:24:21.381 --> 00:24:25.430
After Nina died of a heart attack and Cosima had obtained a divorce during the

422
00:24:25.431 --> 00:24:26.450
early 1870s,

423
00:24:26.451 --> 00:24:30.410
Ricard and Cosima developed a friendship with a young and brilliant philosopher

424
00:24:30.620 --> 00:24:33.800
when he would become professor of classical philosophy at the age of 24,

425
00:24:33.860 --> 00:24:37.610
his name was Friedrich Nietzsche renamed forever associated with that of the

426
00:24:37.611 --> 00:24:38.444
composer,

427
00:24:38.540 --> 00:24:43.040
a competent amateur pianist Nicha had admired Wagner as music and ideals since

428
00:24:43.041 --> 00:24:43.874
his student days,

429
00:24:44.060 --> 00:24:47.960
while teaching at the university of basil nature had taken the habits of

430
00:24:48.050 --> 00:24:51.160
frequently visiting the Wagner who lived in nearby loser.

431
00:24:51.260 --> 00:24:54.950
The young philosopher became a staunch admirer of the older composer,

432
00:24:54.951 --> 00:24:56.630
which she considered a father figure.

433
00:24:56.690 --> 00:24:59.960
He also had potentially developed a small crush for Cosima,

434
00:24:59.990 --> 00:25:04.280
which may have justified the frequent visits in his 1872 book.

435
00:25:04.280 --> 00:25:08.660
The birth of tragedy Friedrich openly expressed his admiration for Wagner in

436
00:25:08.661 --> 00:25:09.111
this work.

437
00:25:09.111 --> 00:25:13.370
He argued that Greek tragedy emerged from the dark and irrational spirit of

438
00:25:13.371 --> 00:25:17.030
music. Partially teamed by principles of order. Over time,

439
00:25:17.031 --> 00:25:21.200
these elements had become imbalanced with a preponderance of rationalism over

440
00:25:21.201 --> 00:25:25.460
the sheer creative impulsive music nature believe that the victory of Socratic

441
00:25:25.461 --> 00:25:30.140
rationalism was plagued in contemporary auspice that Ricard Wagner could

442
00:25:30.170 --> 00:25:34.160
restore the old balance with his impulsive and passionate music.

443
00:25:34.250 --> 00:25:36.440
Having suffered through exiles and revolutions.

444
00:25:36.980 --> 00:25:41.840
Vogner now had a settled stable domestic life with a faithful wife and a devoted

445
00:25:41.841 --> 00:25:44.030
younger friend, a rising star in academia.

446
00:25:44.240 --> 00:25:47.810
He could now direct his energies towards completing his masterpiece.

447
00:25:48.080 --> 00:25:48.913
The ring cycle.

448
00:25:55.600 --> 00:25:55.660
<v 1>[Inaudible].</v>

449
00:25:55.660 --> 00:25:59.860
<v 0>Monumental ring cycle needed a properly monumental opera house and Wagner</v>

450
00:25:59.890 --> 00:26:03.580
identifying the right theater. This was the mile gravel opera house in Bay,

451
00:26:03.581 --> 00:26:08.200
Ruth upper friends' Sonya by now part of the unified second German Reich Vonda

452
00:26:08.230 --> 00:26:09.580
hated the Decker of the place,

453
00:26:09.581 --> 00:26:12.430
finding it too lavish and intricate for his taste,

454
00:26:12.431 --> 00:26:15.340
but he loved the massive 27 meters stage.

455
00:26:15.580 --> 00:26:19.360
As the composer was finishing his work on the librettos and the scores,

456
00:26:19.361 --> 00:26:23.230
he began to rethink his decision on the venue for his Magnum Opus,

457
00:26:23.290 --> 00:26:26.140
rather than composing with the Margrave Yael theater,

458
00:26:26.290 --> 00:26:30.670
he would build a whole new venue that could provide every detail that he wanted.

459
00:26:30.910 --> 00:26:34.150
The design borrowed many ideas from the German theater in Riga,

460
00:26:34.151 --> 00:26:36.160
where he had worked as a young conductor,

461
00:26:36.280 --> 00:26:40.420
the main feature would be the orchestra pit deep enough to hide the musicians

462
00:26:40.421 --> 00:26:43.680
from view allowing audiences to focus entirely on performance.

463
00:26:43.890 --> 00:26:47.340
This setup would allow for music to filter from under the stage,

464
00:26:47.640 --> 00:26:51.300
fill the wooden structure of the theater and surrounds the public with sound

465
00:26:51.400 --> 00:26:53.730
such a project required massive funds,

466
00:26:53.731 --> 00:26:58.020
which Wagner raised by touring tirelessly and is by borrowing more money from

467
00:26:58.021 --> 00:27:00.690
his old friends, Ludovic of Bavaria, the new set.

468
00:27:00.810 --> 00:27:05.400
So the Festspielhaus was completed in time for the premiere of the ring of the

469
00:27:05.401 --> 00:27:09.660
night, belongs from August the 13th through the 17th, 1876.

470
00:27:09.780 --> 00:27:14.130
The rehearsals were not a piece of cake. The score was hellishly difficult.

471
00:27:14.131 --> 00:27:18.720
Unlike anything else the 10 and Sopranos had experienced so far Wagner

472
00:27:19.200 --> 00:27:22.650
itself did not make things easier. Micromanaging every aspect of the production,

473
00:27:22.830 --> 00:27:26.160
despite his best efforts. Some serious cockups did take place though.

474
00:27:26.250 --> 00:27:29.940
A scene in C creed required the presence of a massive animated dragon.

475
00:27:30.060 --> 00:27:34.260
The beast was crafted in London and shipped in pieces to Bay Ruth, but the next,

476
00:27:34.410 --> 00:27:37.500
the most important components ended up in Beirut.

477
00:27:37.650 --> 00:27:41.370
But the show did go on the audience of the premiere included Ludvig of Bavaria

478
00:27:41.970 --> 00:27:44.760
Geyserville Hellman's and para Dom Padre. The second of Brazil,

00:27:56.730 --> 00:28:01.380
Tolstoy nature. They all had a seat in this theater. By this time,

484
00:28:01.410 --> 00:28:04.530
the relationship between the composer and the devoted philosopher had

485
00:28:04.531 --> 00:28:05.820
considerably cooled.

486
00:28:06.060 --> 00:28:10.770
Ideologically speaking nature did not approve of Wagner persistent antisemitism

487
00:28:10.800 --> 00:28:15.150
nor his latest pet hatred or dislike a French culture. At the same time.

488
00:28:15.151 --> 00:28:19.080
Friedrich had comes reevaluate his early disdain of rationalism gravitating

489
00:28:19.081 --> 00:28:22.920
towards the materialistic and scientific ideas of his new friends. Paul hurray,

490
00:28:23.130 --> 00:28:27.420
who happens to be French and Jewish on a personal level nature become wary of

491
00:28:27.990 --> 00:28:31.890
Wagner's overbearing egoism, and disregard for the feelings of those around him.

492
00:28:32.340 --> 00:28:35.790
Kissing points at the premier of the ring. Wagner had his 24 year old mistress.

493
00:28:35.820 --> 00:28:40.590
Judith [inaudible] sitting next to him in full view of poor CaseMap nature's,

1876 paper Richard Wagner reds Bay.

495
00:28:43.231 --> 00:28:46.680
Ruth was critical of the composer as an individual. However,

496
00:28:46.681 --> 00:28:49.800
the philosopher continued to recognize the merits of agonist work.

497
00:28:50.130 --> 00:28:52.620
It wasn't just nature who was piling on the praise.

498
00:28:52.770 --> 00:28:57.150
The ring was matched with wild applause, lauded by audiences and critics alike.

499
00:28:57.360 --> 00:29:01.320
Many praise, the structural innovations employed by Wagner and his theater. Two,

500
00:29:01.321 --> 00:29:02.250
for example,

501
00:29:02.370 --> 00:29:05.880
he had asked for the auditorium to be left in the dark during performances.

502
00:29:05.910 --> 00:29:07.260
This is commonplace now,

503
00:29:07.261 --> 00:29:11.460
but back then it was a revolutionary decision lights were always left on during

504
00:29:11.461 --> 00:29:15.840
shows do allow spectators to mingle or get a refreshment. Wagner is innovation.

505
00:29:15.900 --> 00:29:20.430
Instead demanded that audiences stapled and absorb it continuous flow of musical

506
00:29:20.431 --> 00:29:21.870
drama without interruption.

507
00:29:21.930 --> 00:29:26.460
This was another Wagnerian innovation before him operas were structured as a

508
00:29:26.461 --> 00:29:27.570
series of areas.

509
00:29:27.571 --> 00:29:31.920
Do you add so other set pieces connected by Ray Cito TiVo sections of

510
00:29:32.040 --> 00:29:33.420
sparsely score dialogue,

511
00:29:33.450 --> 00:29:37.980
the masters operas were conceived instead as single massive continuing

512
00:29:37.981 --> 00:29:39.930
compositions. After the triumph of the Bay,

513
00:29:40.140 --> 00:29:43.600
Ruth festival Wagner began work on his latest opera Parsifal,

514
00:29:43.630 --> 00:29:45.700
which took him four years to complete.

515
00:29:45.790 --> 00:29:49.450
This was a mystical near religious experience to him reflected in the abundant

516
00:29:49.451 --> 00:29:51.340
Christian imagery present in this drama.

517
00:29:51.370 --> 00:29:55.390
Eventually he saw the performance of Parsifal as a sort of sacred, right,

518
00:29:55.420 --> 00:29:58.780
which could be performed only in its own dedicated cathedral.

519
00:29:58.990 --> 00:30:03.220
The theater that's by Ruth Wagner finished the score in January, 1882,

520
00:30:03.221 --> 00:30:07.390
when Parsifal was performed 16 times during July and August of that year,

521
00:30:07.570 --> 00:30:10.330
becoming known as the second baby with the festival,

522
00:30:10.420 --> 00:30:14.320
the conductor for the whole run Harmon was the best German he could offer.

523
00:30:14.321 --> 00:30:18.790
And he knew the score inside out. If I've not only had a minor with him,

524
00:30:18.910 --> 00:30:23.650
his surname was Levi and he was Jewish. Apparently the brilliant all beard,

525
00:30:23.680 --> 00:30:27.340
bigoted composer could not stand the idea of a non-Christian musician being

526
00:30:27.341 --> 00:30:30.760
associated with a sacred work Vogner pestered Levi for months,

527
00:30:30.790 --> 00:30:32.290
trying to get him baptized.

528
00:30:32.380 --> 00:30:36.520
Eventually Wagner accepted this Jewish musician would do an outstanding job

529
00:30:36.521 --> 00:30:40.480
after Olin's. The Parsifal was an incredible success elated,

530
00:30:40.510 --> 00:30:44.560
but exhausted by the whole experience Wagner and Cosima retreated to Venice.

531
00:30:44.590 --> 00:30:45.041
The couple,

532
00:30:45.041 --> 00:30:49.150
despite being generally happy had been experiencing some tensions lately and

533
00:30:49.360 --> 00:30:50.890
needed some time to themselves.

534
00:30:50.920 --> 00:30:54.310
The source of those tensions came from and self going through a full-on midlife

535
00:30:54.311 --> 00:30:57.880
crisis. Kaseem had recently found out that after Judith,

536
00:30:58.000 --> 00:31:01.660
he had been having an affair with a young English soprano, Carrie Pringle.

537
00:31:01.780 --> 00:31:03.970
It seems that once Richard pops,

538
00:31:04.180 --> 00:31:08.530
he just couldn't stop proximity to young lovers did not make Ricardo younger,

539
00:31:08.531 --> 00:31:09.364
nor healthier,

540
00:31:09.490 --> 00:31:14.380
already struggling with a heart condition at 2:00 PM on February the 13th, 1883,

541
00:31:14.560 --> 00:31:18.880
Richard Wagner let out a cry of pain while resting in his Venetian Villa.

542
00:31:19.090 --> 00:31:21.850
He died within the hours. Casino played the piano for him.

543
00:31:21.910 --> 00:31:26.170
A funeral gondola carried the Maestro for a procession over the grand canal.

544
00:31:26.230 --> 00:31:29.800
His body was buried in Behrouz, not far from his cathedral.

545
00:31:29.880 --> 00:31:30.713
<v 1>Music</v>

546
00:31:36.540 --> 00:31:36.720
[inaudible].

547
00:31:36.720 --> 00:31:37.560
<v 0>In modern times.</v>

548
00:31:37.920 --> 00:31:41.940
Ricard Wagner's legacy is frequently associated even at the superficial level

549
00:31:42.120 --> 00:31:44.310
with the third Reich and Nazi politics.

550
00:31:44.400 --> 00:31:48.660
It's easy to trace a straight line connecting Wagner as antisemitism, franca,

551
00:31:48.661 --> 00:31:51.300
phobia, German, nationalism, mysticism,

552
00:31:51.301 --> 00:31:55.890
and monumental enthralling music with the ideology and propaganda of

553
00:31:55.920 --> 00:32:00.380
Hitler's regime. But is this association really inevitable? For sure.

554
00:32:00.900 --> 00:32:03.330
[inaudible] loved Wagner's operas in mind, comfy,

555
00:32:03.331 --> 00:32:06.450
even crudes lost the grin and how much it impressed him.

556
00:32:06.540 --> 00:32:09.840
Hitler became chancellor of Germany almost exactly 50 years after Wagner his

557
00:32:09.841 --> 00:32:10.410
death.

558
00:32:10.410 --> 00:32:14.040
He took the occasion to organize a lavish commemorations at Bay Ruth and to

559
00:32:14.041 --> 00:32:17.310
forge friendships with Wagner descendants in later years.

560
00:32:17.311 --> 00:32:20.850
And with the support of propaganda minister, Joseph Goebbels, Hitler,

561
00:32:20.851 --> 00:32:24.480
and the Nazi party effectively appropriated some Wagnerian music.

562
00:32:24.481 --> 00:32:27.270
And I can all graphy into their propaganda efforts,

563
00:32:27.300 --> 00:32:31.980
but this does not mean that Ricard Wagner and the Nazi party were exactly on the

564
00:32:31.981 --> 00:32:32.910
same wavelength.

565
00:32:33.060 --> 00:32:37.410
One of the parties favorites was the ring cycle and its protagonist Siegfried

566
00:32:37.411 --> 00:32:40.430
was interpreted as a fine specimen of German fighting manhood.

567
00:32:40.550 --> 00:32:41.383
But as we've heard,

568
00:32:42.050 --> 00:32:47.030
Wagner's idea was for secret to be more of a subvert or of established order

569
00:32:47.060 --> 00:32:48.890
fighting against powerful elites.

570
00:32:49.100 --> 00:32:51.980
It should be said that there's doesn't minister gobbles liked to pick and choose

571
00:32:51.981 --> 00:32:55.100
which of Bachman's wax suited his goals. For example,

572
00:32:55.101 --> 00:32:59.810
he decided to ban possible in 1939 because it prompted pacifism

573
00:32:59.811 --> 00:33:02.480
spirituality and brotherly love among men,

574
00:33:02.540 --> 00:33:04.790
which is not exactly the best message.

575
00:33:04.820 --> 00:33:08.990
If you want to motivate your troops to go and invade Poland and well,
