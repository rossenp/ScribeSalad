6
00:00:22.910 --> 00:00:27.830
Pull the Persian Kings Xerxes is probably the one best remembered today.

7
00:00:28.070 --> 00:00:31.670
Thanks to his battle with 300 brave little Spartans,

8
00:00:31.671 --> 00:00:35.630
which allowed him to enter the public consciousness in a more broader sense.

9
00:00:35.631 --> 00:00:38.750
He is known for his invasion of mainland Greece,

10
00:00:38.751 --> 00:00:42.500
which went much further than the military campaign of his father Darious.

11
00:00:42.530 --> 00:00:46.340
He saw it as a duty to fulfill his father's mission of punishing the Athenians

12
00:00:46.341 --> 00:00:49.400
for their involvement in the Ionian revolt. In that regard,

13
00:00:49.430 --> 00:00:52.880
he can be considered successful seeing as he conquered and pillaged Athens,

14
00:00:52.881 --> 00:00:57.710
even though Xerxes was ultimately unable to retain his control over Greece,

15
00:00:57.711 --> 00:01:00.320
and he have to retreat back to Persia defeated.

16
00:01:00.650 --> 00:01:04.010
His reign also marks the last period of dominance for the argument at empire

17
00:01:04.190 --> 00:01:04.671
afterwards,

18
00:01:04.671 --> 00:01:08.420
the empire power slowly started to fade it's conquering days were over,

19
00:01:08.630 --> 00:01:12.590
and most of its efforts were focused on keeping the lands that already had until

20
00:01:12.591 --> 00:01:16.760
the inevitable day when it collapsed completely under the might of Alexander the.

21
00:01:17.330 --> 00:01:18.163
<v 1>Reach.</v>

22
00:01:23.990 --> 00:01:25.280
<v 0>Or Kashi Yar, if you want.</v>

23
00:01:25.281 --> 00:01:30.110
The Persian name was born circa 518 BC as the first son of Derrius.

24
00:01:30.111 --> 00:01:34.730
The great ruler of the Academy at empire and his wife Atossa who was also the

25
00:01:34.731 --> 00:01:38.120
daughter of Cyrus, the man who founded the Persian kingdom. And by the way,

26
00:01:38.121 --> 00:01:41.540
we've already done biographics on both Darrius and Cyrus.

27
00:01:41.541 --> 00:01:42.770
If you haven't seen them,

28
00:01:42.771 --> 00:01:46.100
please do check them out to get a better understanding of the Persian empire.

29
00:01:46.101 --> 00:01:51.050
And also because Xerxes is rain picks up where Derrius is ended in his fight

30
00:01:51.051 --> 00:01:54.680
with the Greeks. Just to give you a quick recap, ever since the time of Cyrus,

31
00:01:54.681 --> 00:01:58.940
the R Kevin and empire included Greek city States located not in Greece, proper,

32
00:01:58.941 --> 00:02:01.910
but on the coast of Asia minor, modern day Turkey.

33
00:02:02.060 --> 00:02:05.060
Oftentimes these cities were not actually part of the empire,

34
00:02:05.090 --> 00:02:09.170
but were ruled by tyrants who were named as buy-ins completely subservient the

35
00:02:09.171 --> 00:02:12.290
Persian King in 499 BC. However,

36
00:02:12.291 --> 00:02:16.250
these cities revolted against Derrius with the help of a few mainland Greek city

37
00:02:16.251 --> 00:02:20.270
States. Most notably Athens, eventually Derrius managed to quell the rebellions,

38
00:02:20.271 --> 00:02:24.110
but he also swore vengeance on the Greek city States that provided aid.

39
00:02:24.111 --> 00:02:28.910
And that is how the first Persian invasion of Greece started in 492

40
00:02:28.911 --> 00:02:33.080
BC. The invasion ended in defeat, even though Daria has had the early advantage,

41
00:02:33.081 --> 00:02:36.560
the Persian expedition failed following a decisive Athenian victory at the

42
00:02:36.561 --> 00:02:40.520
battle of marathon in 490 BC. This is not the turndown area.

43
00:02:40.521 --> 00:02:43.190
So you started planning a second invasion immediately,

44
00:02:43.220 --> 00:02:46.040
except that this time he would lead us troops, personally,

45
00:02:46.130 --> 00:02:49.100
something he was unable to do the first time due to his failing health.

46
00:02:49.250 --> 00:02:52.790
His plans were put on hold though, due to another revolt this time in Egypt,

47
00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:54.710
he intended to deal with both problems,

48
00:02:54.711 --> 00:02:58.250
but he died in 486 BC before solving either one.

49
00:02:58.250 --> 00:03:01.120
So his successor would have to pick up where he left off.

50
00:03:01.330 --> 00:03:04.840
Obviously we all know that Xerxes then became the new King of the acumen at

51
00:03:04.841 --> 00:03:07.240
empire, but he did have some competition.

52
00:03:07.420 --> 00:03:10.630
Strictly speaking Xerxes was not Derrius. His oldest son.

53
00:03:10.690 --> 00:03:14.110
He was the oldest son since Derrius took power. And more importantly,

54
00:03:14.320 --> 00:03:18.520
he was the son of a tosser who had the blood of Cyrus, the great in her veins,

55
00:03:18.550 --> 00:03:23.050
but Daria has had three other sons by a different wife before he became a King

56
00:03:23.140 --> 00:03:23.561
of them.

57
00:03:23.561 --> 00:03:27.880
The oldest was [inaudible] and he argued that as the eldest child of Darious,

58
00:03:28.060 --> 00:03:31.390
he deserved to be King Derrius himself was not sure what to do.

59
00:03:31.391 --> 00:03:35.320
And he took counsel strangely enough, from a Greek, not just any Greek,

60
00:03:35.321 --> 00:03:38.170
but a former Spartan King named [inaudible],

61
00:03:38.230 --> 00:03:42.100
who was forced to flee his native land and received a sign of in Persia.

62
00:03:42.160 --> 00:03:45.370
The Spartan advised Daria's taking the side of Zak seasoned,

63
00:03:45.580 --> 00:03:50.350
arguing that [inaudible] would not have the Royal prerogative because when he

64
00:03:50.351 --> 00:03:52.990
was born, both him and his father were still communists.

65
00:03:53.050 --> 00:03:56.830
Derrius was in agreement and named Xerxes to be his successor.

66
00:03:56.980 --> 00:04:00.460
All of this information comes to us courtesy of well, who else,

67
00:04:00.670 --> 00:04:02.260
but good altar us.

68
00:04:02.380 --> 00:04:05.830
And he personally Pines that even without [inaudible] intervention,

69
00:04:05.831 --> 00:04:09.940
Derrius was still likely to put Xerxes on the throne due to the power and

70
00:04:09.941 --> 00:04:13.420
influence of a tosser. So sometime in late 486,

71
00:04:13.900 --> 00:04:17.080
BC axes became the new King and his Ascension. When smoothly,

72
00:04:17.081 --> 00:04:18.280
without any challenges,

73
00:04:18.550 --> 00:04:22.390
he then wrote down the fact in a famous inscription to set the record straight

74
00:04:23.020 --> 00:04:26.230
safe. Zach sees the King, other sons of Derrius. There were thus,

75
00:04:26.650 --> 00:04:29.200
or who remaster was the desire Derrius.

76
00:04:29.201 --> 00:04:32.020
My father made me the greatest after himself.

77
00:04:32.140 --> 00:04:35.830
When my father Derrius went away from the throne by the will of RMS,

78
00:04:36.060 --> 00:04:38.080
I became King on my father's throne.

79
00:04:44.460 --> 00:04:45.180
<v 1>[Inaudible].</v>

80
00:04:45.180 --> 00:04:46.860
<v 0>He's ruled over the Academy at empire.</v>

81
00:04:46.890 --> 00:04:50.550
He has important matters to attend to the Greeks would have to wait as fast.

82
00:04:50.551 --> 00:04:52.350
That was the matter of the Egyptian revolts.

83
00:04:52.500 --> 00:04:54.240
This did not prove overly difficult.

84
00:04:54.630 --> 00:04:57.300
Zach's he's already had an army at the ready as his father mustard.

85
00:04:57.301 --> 00:04:59.940
It an anticipation of going to war against Athens.

86
00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:02.880
We do not have too many details about this military campaign,

87
00:05:02.881 --> 00:05:06.600
but the Persian King was able to put down the rebellion in a single expedition

88
00:05:06.601 --> 00:05:11.580
in 485 BC. He was much harsher with his conquered foes than his predecessors,

89
00:05:11.581 --> 00:05:15.030
imposing ruthless punishments on the Egyptians and leaving his brother.

90
00:05:15.210 --> 00:05:18.090
Our Kemeny is behind to govern the province. The following year,

91
00:05:18.091 --> 00:05:21.450
there was another rebellion this time in battle on led by a man named Belle

92
00:05:22.110 --> 00:05:25.410
Shamani again, Xerxes marched his army and put down this uprising.

93
00:05:25.411 --> 00:05:30.150
And just a matter of weeks, two years later in 482 BC Babylon rebelled,

94
00:05:30.180 --> 00:05:34.050
once more under Shemesh Ariba who declared himself the new King,

95
00:05:34.260 --> 00:05:36.030
although this revolt was also defeated,

96
00:05:36.240 --> 00:05:41.070
it proved more durable than the first one and required a months long siege of

97
00:05:41.160 --> 00:05:41.670
the city.

98
00:05:41.670 --> 00:05:46.080
Ancient sources tell us that Xerxes was severe in his punishment of Babylon and

99
00:05:46.110 --> 00:05:47.610
ended the special relationship.

100
00:05:47.640 --> 00:05:50.940
This one's great embar had with the Persians up until that point,

101
00:05:50.970 --> 00:05:52.920
ever since it had been conquered by Cyrus,

102
00:05:53.040 --> 00:05:55.680
Babylon was regarded as one of the recommended empires,

103
00:05:55.700 --> 00:05:59.840
greatest possessions through always use the title King of Babylon and

104
00:05:59.841 --> 00:06:03.410
inscriptions and to the Persian King also took part in Babylonian religious

105
00:06:03.411 --> 00:06:04.520
rights, every new year,

106
00:06:04.820 --> 00:06:09.080
by traveling to the city to take the hands of the statue of Marduk Babylonian,

107
00:06:09.081 --> 00:06:12.230
God placed inside the city's main temple. The ESSA Gila,

108
00:06:12.530 --> 00:06:15.140
this all ended under seas, he and the temples pillaged,

109
00:06:15.141 --> 00:06:19.400
and allegedly even removed the statue of Mada and brought it to Persia to be

110
00:06:19.401 --> 00:06:20.810
melted down since then.

111
00:06:20.870 --> 00:06:24.650
He also no longer use the title King of Babylon and inscriptions instead

112
00:06:24.651 --> 00:06:27.950
referring to himself as King of the Persians and the Medes.

113
00:06:28.160 --> 00:06:30.140
Now there's all the internal strife was dealt with.

114
00:06:30.170 --> 00:06:34.310
It was finally time to take on the Greeks or was it classical sources like

115
00:06:34.670 --> 00:06:38.240
Rhonda does made Xerxes zone to be very undecided regarding the path he should

116
00:06:38.241 --> 00:06:40.700
take. We cannot say how accurate this portrayal was,

117
00:06:40.701 --> 00:06:45.470
but it indicated that the King alternated at least three times between war and

118
00:06:45.471 --> 00:06:50.360
peace at first Xerxes wanted war mainly persuaded by my donors, his cousin,

119
00:06:50.361 --> 00:06:51.740
and his, one of his closest allies.

120
00:06:51.950 --> 00:06:55.670
His arguments were that the Greeks had to be punished for what they did to the

121
00:06:55.671 --> 00:06:56.390
Persians,

122
00:06:56.390 --> 00:07:01.310
but also the Greek mainland rich and beautiful lands worthy of no

123
00:07:01.311 --> 00:07:02.270
mortal master.

124
00:07:02.420 --> 00:07:07.400
But the King decided Xerxes held in assembly with all his Nobles and told them

125
00:07:07.401 --> 00:07:11.060
of his plans. He said for myself, ever since I came to this throne,

126
00:07:11.210 --> 00:07:15.710
I have taken thought how best I shall not fall short in this honorable

127
00:07:15.711 --> 00:07:17.600
place of those that went before me.

128
00:07:17.780 --> 00:07:21.950
And my thoughts persuades me that we may win not only renown,

129
00:07:22.100 --> 00:07:25.370
but a lands neither less Norwest, but more fertile,

130
00:07:25.790 --> 00:07:27.470
which we now possess for this.

131
00:07:27.890 --> 00:07:31.280
Cause I have now summoned you together that I may impart to you my purpose.

132
00:07:31.430 --> 00:07:36.320
It is my intent to bridge the hell spawns and take my army through Europe to

133
00:07:36.890 --> 00:07:38.840
Hollis that I may punish the Athenians,

134
00:07:39.170 --> 00:07:41.450
what they have done to the Persians and to my father.

135
00:07:41.660 --> 00:07:46.100
He is dead and it was not granted him to punish them and die on his and all the

136
00:07:46.101 --> 00:07:50.300
Persians behalf will never rest till I have taken and burnt Athens for the

137
00:07:50.301 --> 00:07:55.150
unprovoked rock, but it's people did to my father and me, my daughter has again,

138
00:07:55.180 --> 00:07:57.010
spoke up to applaud the King's decision.

139
00:07:57.220 --> 00:08:01.240
The other nobleman required except for an uncle of Xerxes named art Abana who

140
00:08:01.450 --> 00:08:04.120
advised him to reconsider years prior. [inaudible]

141
00:08:04.150 --> 00:08:07.660
had told dairies the same thing when he wanted to go to war against the Syrians

142
00:08:07.661 --> 00:08:11.950
and now's axes wanted to do the same against a much more powerful foe.

143
00:08:12.250 --> 00:08:16.330
An army made up of the most doubty warriors by sea and land.

144
00:08:16.600 --> 00:08:21.010
The King was greatly angered by art Abana saying that it was only because he was

145
00:08:21.011 --> 00:08:24.070
his father's brother, that he escaped punishment for his insolence.

146
00:08:24.340 --> 00:08:26.440
It seemed that Xerxes had made his decision,

147
00:08:26.441 --> 00:08:29.200
but that night had a vision which caused him to change his mind.

148
00:08:29.290 --> 00:08:32.650
And the next day he claims that he would not March against Greece and instead

149
00:08:32.680 --> 00:08:34.390
would abide in peace.

150
00:08:34.420 --> 00:08:37.070
But then the next night he had another vision which offered Xerxes.

151
00:08:37.180 --> 00:08:40.030
He's a prophecy saying that if he did not lead his army armies,

152
00:08:40.031 --> 00:08:43.780
the things that made him great and mighty would disappear and he would be

153
00:08:43.781 --> 00:08:44.890
brought low. Again,

154
00:08:44.980 --> 00:08:48.520
this vision so greatly frightened the Persian King that he went to his uncle,

155
00:08:49.030 --> 00:08:53.200
Audubon us to tell him about it and then ask him to wear the Royal robes and

156
00:08:53.260 --> 00:08:55.530
sleep in the Royal bed the adviser did. So,

157
00:08:55.610 --> 00:08:59.190
and it's the same prophetic dream came to him wanting again of terrible things

158
00:08:59.191 --> 00:09:01.350
that would before Zach sees, if he did not go to walk.

159
00:09:01.530 --> 00:09:04.350
And so finally autobalance himself changed his mind.

160
00:09:04.351 --> 00:09:08.220
And from then on the Persian King became intense on invading and conquering

161
00:09:08.221 --> 00:09:10.560
Greece. And look, if you're enjoying today's video,

than curiosity stream for this channel. And let's get back to it.

183
00:10:22.370 --> 00:10:24.680
Evenly Xerxes have finally made up his mind.

184
00:10:24.770 --> 00:10:29.210
He did not charge headfirst into battle. Instead he spent years in preparation.

185
00:10:29.240 --> 00:10:32.750
The initial challenge was simply getting degrees in one piece. First,

186
00:10:32.751 --> 00:10:36.290
the army had to cross from Asia into three spike traversing,

187
00:10:36.291 --> 00:10:39.170
the Dardanelles straits known back then as hell spawns.

188
00:10:39.290 --> 00:10:40.520
According to her auditors,

189
00:10:40.550 --> 00:10:45.320
Xerxes the Egyptians and Phoenicians built two bridges that connected to solders

190
00:10:45.321 --> 00:10:49.400
the former capital of Lydia to another city named Abbott dos on the other side

191
00:10:49.401 --> 00:10:50.600
of the street. However,

192
00:10:50.630 --> 00:10:54.980
those bridges were broken and swept away by a furious storm. So great.

193
00:10:55.030 --> 00:10:58.370
It was the anger of the King when he found out that he not only had the builders

194
00:10:58.371 --> 00:10:59.031
executed,

195
00:10:59.031 --> 00:11:03.170
but also ordered his men to give 300 whip lashes to the hell spont itself,

196
00:11:03.410 --> 00:11:06.410
and to drop a pair of manacles into the water to symbolize this.

197
00:11:06.590 --> 00:11:10.310
Even the sea itself, must've be the will of his axes. Afterwards.

198
00:11:10.311 --> 00:11:14.300
He had two pontoon bridges built, which proved to be sturdier and more reliable.

199
00:11:14.660 --> 00:11:19.110
Nan's in 480 BC, the Persians crossed the street into Europe in three,

200
00:11:19.220 --> 00:11:22.820
the army went two ways part by lands and part by CAEP. However,

201
00:11:22.821 --> 00:11:26.540
Xerxes was careful to avoid a lethal mistake made by one of his father's

202
00:11:26.541 --> 00:11:30.380
generals. During the first invasion of Greece athlos was not a launch peninsula,

203
00:11:30.410 --> 00:11:34.280
but the waters around it were treacherous. So when the fleet went around, it,

204
00:11:34.490 --> 00:11:38.240
it was caught in a storm and destroyed to avoid having the same thing happened

205
00:11:38.241 --> 00:11:38.810
to him.

206
00:11:38.810 --> 00:11:42.560
Xerxes ordered his men to build a canal through the Smiths that connected the

207
00:11:42.561 --> 00:11:45.860
peninsula to the mainlands. Obviously over the course of millennia,

208
00:11:45.890 --> 00:11:48.530
the Xerxes canal was completely buried in sediments,

209
00:11:48.680 --> 00:11:51.410
but it was actually found recently using aerial photography.

210
00:11:51.620 --> 00:11:54.910
There remains one of the few traces of the invasion of European soil,

211
00:11:54.940 --> 00:11:59.650
but it also serves as a nice reminder that I rather just occasionally knew what

212
00:11:59.651 --> 00:12:01.640
he was talking about. And speaking of heroic,

213
00:12:02.080 --> 00:12:05.800
the historian claims that the army assembled by Xerxes was the largest in

214
00:12:05.801 --> 00:12:08.650
existence. Unlike anything the world had seen before,

215
00:12:08.770 --> 00:12:12.550
it contains soldiers from all over Asia of 30 different ethnicities.

216
00:12:12.640 --> 00:12:16.480
And that did not take into account the numerous three Sian tribes that Xerxes

217
00:12:16.481 --> 00:12:17.890
encountered on his way to Greece,

218
00:12:17.891 --> 00:12:21.430
which were added to his numbers either willingly or by force. However,

219
00:12:21.431 --> 00:12:24.700
we cannot provide you with an accurate figure is the size of the army is still

220
00:12:24.701 --> 00:12:25.630
hotly debated.

221
00:12:25.660 --> 00:12:30.310
And the estimates are all over the place from a few hundred thousand soldiers as

222
00:12:30.311 --> 00:12:34.330
proposed by modern scholars to a few million based on ancient sources,

223
00:12:34.420 --> 00:12:38.230
either way. This was an army that no Greek city state hoped to take on loan.

224
00:12:38.410 --> 00:12:39.243
The Greeks, however,

225
00:12:39.460 --> 00:12:43.660
had not been dawdling this whole time ever since they repelled the first Persian

226
00:12:43.661 --> 00:12:44.890
invasion under Darrius,

227
00:12:44.891 --> 00:12:48.640
they knew it was only a matter of time before a new one would come the Athenians

228
00:12:48.641 --> 00:12:51.130
in particular, who was Xerxes main targeted,

229
00:12:51.280 --> 00:12:55.420
but in busy building up their fleet for an unrelated war with another city state

230
00:12:55.960 --> 00:12:58.660
names, uh, Gina, however, in 481 BC,

231
00:12:58.661 --> 00:13:00.700
when they heard that the Persian army was on the move,

232
00:13:00.820 --> 00:13:05.320
dozens of Greek city States held a council in Corinth and decided to put aside

233
00:13:05.410 --> 00:13:08.050
all their feuds and deal with this major threat.

234
00:13:08.260 --> 00:13:10.480
Many other cities States wanted no part of it.

235
00:13:10.600 --> 00:13:14.200
So instead paid tribute to Xerxes when he sent forth ambassadors,

236
00:13:14.201 --> 00:13:15.760
asking for earth and water,

237
00:13:15.970 --> 00:13:18.820
hoping that his issues with Greece would not involve them.

238
00:13:19.030 --> 00:13:22.420
Only two city States were never given this option because the axes admitted them

239
00:13:22.421 --> 00:13:25.300
from the start. Those States were Athens and Sparta.

240
00:13:32.040 --> 00:13:32.520
<v 2>Hello.</v>

241
00:13:32.520 --> 00:13:36.000
<v 0>480 BC, [inaudible] out his first major encounter.</v>

242
00:13:36.120 --> 00:13:39.690
And then this is the famous one that everybody has heard about the battle of

243
00:13:39.691 --> 00:13:40.320
Thermopylae,

244
00:13:40.320 --> 00:13:45.270
where 300 Spartans led by King Liana dis staged a daring lost stand fighting

245
00:13:45.300 --> 00:13:46.230
bravely to God.

246
00:13:46.260 --> 00:13:50.340
The coastal pass of the marbly also called the hot Gates in the ends of the

247
00:13:50.760 --> 00:13:53.700
varsity superior numbers of the Persian army proved too much to overcome.

248
00:13:53.701 --> 00:13:56.940
And all the Spartans fell in battle. If you're familiar with this event,

249
00:13:56.941 --> 00:13:59.670
it's probably because of the movie 300 or the comic book series,

250
00:13:59.671 --> 00:14:00.930
it was based on however,

251
00:14:00.960 --> 00:14:04.560
those two helped create a few prevalent myths about the battle of the marbly.

252
00:14:04.561 --> 00:14:08.760
And we're not just talking about showing Xerxes as a seven-foot giants with a

253
00:14:08.761 --> 00:14:11.250
thing for gold piercings. Undoubtedly,

254
00:14:11.251 --> 00:14:14.970
the biggest myth is that the 300 Spartans were there alone. In fact,

255
00:14:15.060 --> 00:14:16.890
they weren't not even close.

256
00:14:16.920 --> 00:14:19.080
The Spartans might've been in charge of the defense,

257
00:14:19.081 --> 00:14:22.970
but they were joined by about a dozen other Greek groups, including thespians,

258
00:14:23.550 --> 00:14:25.920
DBMS Arcadians and fissions syncytial.

259
00:14:26.090 --> 00:14:29.370
There were around 6,000 to 7,000 Greeks at the battle of Thermopylae as to the

260
00:14:29.371 --> 00:14:32.130
Persians, but we don't know a lot more than that.

261
00:14:32.190 --> 00:14:37.020
Certainly as a Roger just claims that just their casualties number 20,000 men,

262
00:14:37.140 --> 00:14:40.050
a crucial role in the basket was played by FLTs.

263
00:14:40.110 --> 00:14:43.470
This was the spot and who betrayed his people and told Zach seas of a secret

264
00:14:43.471 --> 00:14:45.510
trail that allowed his soldiers to flank the enemy.

265
00:14:45.900 --> 00:14:49.440
It was actually real that he was not a to form spot and he resented his

266
00:14:49.441 --> 00:14:52.010
compatriots because he could not fight alongside them.

267
00:14:52.130 --> 00:14:53.780
He wasn't despising at all. In fact,

268
00:14:53.810 --> 00:14:56.270
he was part of a Greek group called the Malawians,

269
00:14:56.271 --> 00:14:58.880
who lived in the city state of trackers. Lastly,

270
00:14:58.881 --> 00:15:02.660
a lot of sources mythologized this battle and portrayed the Greeks is willingly

271
00:15:02.661 --> 00:15:06.170
undertaking a suicide mission where they knew from the start that they had no

272
00:15:06.171 --> 00:15:07.370
chance of winning. Again,

273
00:15:07.371 --> 00:15:11.120
this is not true if there were truly only 300 Spartans, maybe,

274
00:15:11.330 --> 00:15:15.230
but it would have made absolutely no sense to sacrifice a whole army of 7,000

275
00:15:15.231 --> 00:15:16.520
soldiers for no reason.

276
00:15:16.580 --> 00:15:20.090
This is evidenced by the fact that once the Greeks realized that the Persians

277
00:15:20.091 --> 00:15:22.940
were flanking them, most of their remaining forces retreated,

278
00:15:23.000 --> 00:15:26.930
that is when Liana does and to Spartans decided to stay behind and form a rear

279
00:15:27.320 --> 00:15:29.540
guard in order to give everyone else time to escape.

280
00:15:29.570 --> 00:15:30.680
They still were not alone though.

281
00:15:30.830 --> 00:15:33.830
The thespians and the oceans also stayed behind to fight.

282
00:15:33.831 --> 00:15:37.010
So they deserve some credit to the Thebans also stayed,

283
00:15:37.011 --> 00:15:40.460
but eventually surrendered finally, well, this is not a myth.

284
00:15:40.490 --> 00:15:44.000
It is an important aspect that is often forgotten while the land's battle at the

285
00:15:44.001 --> 00:15:44.930
monopoly was going on.

286
00:15:44.960 --> 00:15:48.500
The Greeks and the Persians were simultaneously engaged in an important Naval

287
00:15:48.501 --> 00:15:51.080
conflict known as the battle of Artemisium.

288
00:15:51.260 --> 00:15:54.020
The bulk of the Greek forces was provided by Athens,

289
00:15:54.021 --> 00:15:57.260
since they have the strongest fleet aided by Corinth McGarrah, uh,

290
00:15:57.261 --> 00:15:59.150
Gina chock is Sparta and others.

291
00:15:59.330 --> 00:16:02.330
The battle was not a crushing defeat for the Greeks like the monopoly,

292
00:16:02.331 --> 00:16:06.680
but they still were able to stop the advance of the Persians following these two

293
00:16:07.160 --> 00:16:09.920
encounters Xerxes to gain control over the regions of Ebola,

294
00:16:09.950 --> 00:16:12.650
but we share and focuses. And most importantly,

295
00:16:12.651 --> 00:16:17.180
he had a clear route to Attica where Athens was located in September 480 BC

296
00:16:17.210 --> 00:16:21.140
Xerxes ended Athens, the city had been mostly abandoned with the seniors,

297
00:16:21.200 --> 00:16:22.950
fleeing to a Gina and Solomon,

298
00:16:23.150 --> 00:16:25.760
just a few remains to try and protect the Acropolis,

299
00:16:25.761 --> 00:16:27.740
but they were easily defeated. So actually it was,

300
00:16:27.860 --> 00:16:30.950
was finally able to fulfill the Val first made by his father to punish the

301
00:16:30.951 --> 00:16:34.730
Athenians for their interference in the Ionian revolt always two decades prior.

302
00:16:35.120 --> 00:16:37.250
Yeah, the city burns and pillaged Athenian,

303
00:16:37.251 --> 00:16:40.370
symbols like Pantheon and the temple of Athena were raised to the ground.

304
00:16:40.490 --> 00:16:44.360
Although these would be rebuilt a few decades later by paraklete is bigger and

305
00:16:44.361 --> 00:16:45.194
better than ever.

306
00:16:52.030 --> 00:16:54.280
Well, everything seemed to go in Xerxes favor.

307
00:16:54.370 --> 00:16:57.730
All the remaining Greek forces have gathered on the Peloponnesian peninsula in

308
00:16:57.731 --> 00:16:58.540
the South of Greece,

309
00:16:58.540 --> 00:17:02.440
which on foot could only have been accessed by crossing the narrow isthmus of

310
00:17:02.441 --> 00:17:03.310
Corinth. However,

311
00:17:03.311 --> 00:17:07.240
the Greeks took steps to ensure this would not happen as they destroyed the only

312
00:17:07.510 --> 00:17:08.980
roads and directed a wall in its place.

313
00:17:09.040 --> 00:17:11.260
It was actually his work to continue his conquest of Greece.

314
00:17:11.590 --> 00:17:13.870
It would have to do it by water strategically.

315
00:17:13.930 --> 00:17:17.080
It would have been wiser to wait out the Greeks by creating a blockade,

316
00:17:17.081 --> 00:17:19.570
to surround their Navy concentrated around Salomon.

317
00:17:19.571 --> 00:17:23.260
Since he went out each group of people to slowly disband and return to their own

318
00:17:23.261 --> 00:17:24.190
cities. In fact,

319
00:17:24.191 --> 00:17:28.540
one of the Persian Kings allies queen Artemisia or of carrier advised him to do

320
00:17:28.570 --> 00:17:31.840
just this, however, his other generals, and indeed Zach sees himself.

321
00:17:31.960 --> 00:17:35.800
We're sure a victory with one giant show of force at sea after all his fleet was

322
00:17:35.801 --> 00:17:38.890
bigger, consisted of better ships. And at the tactical advantage,

323
00:17:39.160 --> 00:17:43.330
the battle of Solomons took place sometime in late September 480 BC.

324
00:17:43.510 --> 00:17:47.140
And it was a shocking and brutal defeat for the Persians that completely turned

325
00:17:47.141 --> 00:17:49.530
the tide of the campaign in favor of Greeks.

326
00:17:49.650 --> 00:17:53.100
Unfortunately none of the classical sources gave a detailed account of the

327
00:17:53.101 --> 00:17:56.730
battle. So we don't know what bold and brilliant military strategies,

328
00:17:56.731 --> 00:17:59.310
the Greeks employed to secure the unlikely victory.

329
00:17:59.610 --> 00:18:01.290
I wrote it just mainly credits this country,

330
00:18:01.440 --> 00:18:04.530
men for being orderly and determined while the Persian army was much more

331
00:18:04.531 --> 00:18:06.240
chaotic and disorganized,

332
00:18:06.241 --> 00:18:09.570
which she sees as the reason that they should come to suction and,

333
00:18:09.930 --> 00:18:11.610
but fell them to illustrate his point.

334
00:18:11.611 --> 00:18:14.010
He tells the story of the AFA mentioned autumn Mysia,

335
00:18:14.190 --> 00:18:18.600
who while being chased by an Athenian trireme around and destroyed a friendly

336
00:18:18.601 --> 00:18:21.510
ship to convince her pursuers that she was on their side.

337
00:18:21.660 --> 00:18:23.190
The vessel she sang got on board,

338
00:18:23.191 --> 00:18:26.460
the King of calendars who died in the water and other early casualty at the

339
00:18:26.461 --> 00:18:28.680
start of the battle was Aria, big knees,

340
00:18:28.681 --> 00:18:32.310
a brother of [inaudible] and the Admiral leading the Phoenician fleet whose

341
00:18:32.460 --> 00:18:37.410
death caused a lot of panic and loss of morale among the Persian Navy died gives

342
00:18:37.590 --> 00:18:41.280
lots of credit to the Athenians for the role they played in the victory,

343
00:18:41.281 --> 00:18:45.090
which is not surprising considering they accounted for over half of the entire

344
00:18:45.091 --> 00:18:45.924
Greek fleet.

345
00:18:45.930 --> 00:18:49.500
Also noteworthy with the McGarry ones and the Agon nations who were considered

346
00:18:49.501 --> 00:18:53.310
the best seaman off to the Athenians and alone informs the right-wing of the

347
00:18:53.311 --> 00:18:56.460
Greek forces. The location of the battle also played an important role.

348
00:18:56.490 --> 00:18:58.170
The passage inside the Strait of Salem,

349
00:18:58.320 --> 00:19:00.870
this was too narrow for the advancing Persian line,

350
00:19:00.871 --> 00:19:03.450
which had to withdraw ships and reorganized mid battle,

351
00:19:03.600 --> 00:19:07.350
thus leading to the general chaos and confusion, which ended in their downfall.

352
00:19:07.410 --> 00:19:11.340
This shocking, upset, forced Zach seas to completely reconsider his next move.

353
00:19:11.490 --> 00:19:14.880
He did not want to spend the winter in Greece and then another season

354
00:19:14.881 --> 00:19:17.190
campaigning while neglecting the rest of his empire.

355
00:19:17.400 --> 00:19:20.850
He also feared that the Greek Navy might make its way up North and destroy the

356
00:19:20.851 --> 00:19:22.680
bridges. He had built across the health bonds,

357
00:19:22.830 --> 00:19:25.140
thus trapping his land army in Europe.

358
00:19:25.230 --> 00:19:28.980
Therefore he decided to take a large part of his army and to make his way home

359
00:19:29.130 --> 00:19:32.490
leaving his elite infantry and his cavalry under the command of his general,

360
00:19:32.700 --> 00:19:35.640
Mar Donius to keep the pressure on in mainland Greece.

361
00:19:35.700 --> 00:19:38.760
This strategy did not end well for the Persians after winter passed,

362
00:19:38.790 --> 00:19:40.080
they were on the warpath again,

363
00:19:40.081 --> 00:19:43.500
but so were the Greeks who had time to reorganize and strengthen their forces.

364
00:19:43.710 --> 00:19:47.430
The Greek army mainly consisted of Spartans, Athenians and Corinthians.

365
00:19:47.431 --> 00:19:50.970
Although over a dozen other cities also contributed soldiers.

366
00:19:51.030 --> 00:19:55.290
The two sides match at the battle of potassium sometime during the summer of 479

367
00:19:55.291 --> 00:19:56.190
BC. Again,

368
00:19:56.191 --> 00:19:59.670
it was a triumphant victory for the Greeks decisive enough that it drove the

369
00:19:59.671 --> 00:20:02.550
Persians away from the Greek mainland's at the same time,

370
00:20:02.551 --> 00:20:06.030
the Greek fleet made its way to Asia minor to execute a preemptive strike on the

371
00:20:06.031 --> 00:20:09.180
remaining Persian Navy station that instead of a Naval vessel,

372
00:20:09.210 --> 00:20:11.760
the Persians coerced the Greeks into coming on lens.

373
00:20:11.761 --> 00:20:14.640
But this tactic was in vain at the battle of Mikael,

374
00:20:14.670 --> 00:20:18.630
the Greeks beloved a final crushing blow to their opponents effectively ending

375
00:20:18.631 --> 00:20:20.310
the Persian invasion afterwards,

376
00:20:20.311 --> 00:20:22.980
the Spartans and the rest of the Peloponnese sailed home,

377
00:20:23.130 --> 00:20:24.810
considering their mission, a success,

378
00:20:24.840 --> 00:20:28.350
the Athenians and other city States pressed on with a counter attack to liberate

379
00:20:28.351 --> 00:20:29.610
the Greeks in Ionia as well.

380
00:20:35.960 --> 00:20:36.410
<v 2>[Inaudible].</v>

381
00:20:36.410 --> 00:20:39.320
<v 0>Tell how Xerxes perceived his military campaign in Greece.</v>

382
00:20:39.380 --> 00:20:43.820
Obviously it didn't end like he wants it, but he did accomplish his stated goal,

383
00:20:43.940 --> 00:20:45.350
which was to punish Athens.

384
00:20:45.530 --> 00:20:48.820
It would have been possible for him to rebuild his army and try again in a few

385
00:20:48.821 --> 00:20:52.900
years. But from that point on, he seems more concerned with internal matters,

386
00:20:52.901 --> 00:20:56.800
ensuring that he maintains control over his possessions in the middle East and

387
00:20:56.830 --> 00:21:00.460
Northern Africa. He also became a prolific builder during this time,

388
00:21:00.490 --> 00:21:02.560
mainly in Persepolis and Susa.

389
00:21:02.740 --> 00:21:06.550
He completed the unfinished projects of his father and started his own the app

390
00:21:06.551 --> 00:21:10.330
and Donna, the gate of all nations. That's a cholera palace, the Citadel,

391
00:21:10.331 --> 00:21:12.220
the gardens, the canals of Persepolis.

392
00:21:12.221 --> 00:21:15.820
They were all finished during the 15 years that followed Xerxes did have one

393
00:21:15.821 --> 00:21:18.220
last attempt in 466 BC.

394
00:21:18.340 --> 00:21:21.670
When he tried to regain control of the Ionian States in Asia minor,

395
00:21:21.820 --> 00:21:25.000
if he had succeeded, he would have likely considered a third invasion,

396
00:21:25.150 --> 00:21:28.690
but he was defeated at the battle of Euro medium by a Greek Alliance,

397
00:21:28.691 --> 00:21:30.130
known as the deli and league.

398
00:21:30.130 --> 00:21:32.830
And he gave up whatever plans that he might've had,

399
00:21:33.040 --> 00:21:34.930
even if he did intend on a new invasion,

400
00:21:34.990 --> 00:21:38.110
he would not have had the opportunity to go through with it because he was

401
00:21:38.111 --> 00:21:41.350
assassinated the following year in 465 BC,

402
00:21:41.380 --> 00:21:45.600
both Xerxes and disaster crown Prince Darious were killed by an official named

403
00:21:45.880 --> 00:21:48.460
oughta. Bannis the circumstances are somewhat unclear.

404
00:21:48.520 --> 00:21:52.420
Some sources say that the politician first killed Derrius and fearing the wrath

405
00:21:52.421 --> 00:21:54.070
of Xerxes arranged for the King's death.

406
00:21:54.071 --> 00:21:58.420
As well as to say that Audubon us first had sexy skeletons made it look like

407
00:21:58.421 --> 00:22:01.660
Derrius was responsible and Scottish executed either way.

408
00:22:01.661 --> 00:22:05.380
The Kings other son Artaxerxes ascended to the throne of Persia and upon

409
00:22:05.410 --> 00:22:09.340
discovering the treachery of Autobon us Hadden and his sons all executed.

410
00:22:09.700 --> 00:22:11.890
