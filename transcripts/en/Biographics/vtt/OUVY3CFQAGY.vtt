00:00:00.100 --> 00:00:03.120
<v 0>Two things before you get started today. Number one, pronunciation,</v>

2
00:00:03.121 --> 00:00:06.960
trigger warning everybody. I am absolutely going to ruin some names today.

3
00:00:07.650 --> 00:00:10.920
Enjoy, and number two, this video is like 20 minutes long.

4
00:00:11.180 --> 00:00:13.880
How often do you see stuff like that on YouTube, but not very often.

5
00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:14.601
I will tell you,

6
00:00:14.601 --> 00:00:18.920
and we are able to make these super long videos because of amazing companies.

7
00:00:18.921 --> 00:00:20.080
Like Viero.

8
00:00:20.790 --> 00:00:24.390
If you want to support us and look pretty awesome at the same time,

9
00:00:24.970 --> 00:00:28.830
you need to get hooked up with a Viero watch.

10
00:00:29.140 --> 00:00:32.470
<v 1>This is the rogue. Uh, I got this last month,</v>

11
00:00:32.590 --> 00:00:36.030
I went for black on black because black on black looks awesome,

12
00:00:36.031 --> 00:00:39.190
but there's also other cool combinations that you can go for. Uh,

13
00:00:39.350 --> 00:00:42.820
lemme just talk a couple of cool things about this watch and why you should buy

14
00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:43.860
one. Number one,

15
00:00:44.170 --> 00:00:48.660
it's a bit of a beast like it's heavy and you might think that's a negative

16
00:00:48.661 --> 00:00:49.180
thing.

17
00:00:49.180 --> 00:00:53.140
<v 0>I completely disagree. I think a heavy watch is, I don't know.</v>

18
00:00:53.220 --> 00:00:56.380
It just feels good for some reason, this strap, you see this strap,

19
00:00:56.381 --> 00:00:59.860
this isn't some like strap. You gotta thread through you pop that on there.

20
00:01:00.040 --> 00:01:04.010
You clip this on you clip like that. And then you just, you just pop it off.

21
00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:08.810
This is, uh, my other Venter watch this one has a black leather strap.

22
00:01:09.120 --> 00:01:10.530
This isn't perfectly demonstrated.

23
00:01:10.730 --> 00:01:13.410
Cuz what I actually have here is a brown leather strap.

24
00:01:13.610 --> 00:01:14.890
It comes in this cool box like this.

25
00:01:14.950 --> 00:01:18.450
And then what you can do is you can just attach a new strap on there and give

26
00:01:18.451 --> 00:01:20.170
the watch a whole different look.

27
00:01:20.171 --> 00:01:23.160
What I really wanted to say though is because it don't replace it with a leather

28
00:01:23.161 --> 00:01:25.960
strap, get a metal one or a rubber one,

29
00:01:26.060 --> 00:01:27.560
and then you can wear it through the summer heat.

30
00:01:27.561 --> 00:01:28.920
If you've got really sweaty wrists,

31
00:01:28.921 --> 00:01:32.560
like I do supporting sponsors like Viero it really does support me.

32
00:01:32.660 --> 00:01:36.360
And it supports this show. Also you can get 15% off. One of these of iTero

33
00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:41.680
watches.com/biographics and use the code biographics and let's get on with it.

34
00:01:41.681 --> 00:01:42.514
Shall we,

35
00:01:48.210 --> 00:01:51.870
It was not uncommon for political and military leaders of the CEL Turks during

36
00:01:51.890 --> 00:01:56.150
the 11th and 12th century CE to wake up to a surprise,

37
00:01:56.510 --> 00:02:01.110
a der firmly planted on the floor next to their bed, despite the fortres walls,

38
00:02:01.210 --> 00:02:06.180
the bolted doors and the armed somebody had entered their bedroom and left a

39
00:02:06.181 --> 00:02:07.780
note do, as you are told,

40
00:02:07.781 --> 00:02:11.340
or the next time the der will be planted in your chest,

41
00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:14.380
but sometimes no warning was given.

42
00:02:14.560 --> 00:02:18.940
The merciless blade would find its way straight into the heart or the throat

43
00:02:19.360 --> 00:02:24.010
of its target intimidation and targeting killings of high far victims

44
00:02:24.150 --> 00:02:29.010
became their hallmark tactics and they protracted and often desperate fight

45
00:02:29.040 --> 00:02:33.050
against a powerful invader. They became known as the assassins,

46
00:02:33.070 --> 00:02:37.530
the loyal followers and guardians to the founder and leader of their movement,

47
00:02:37.980 --> 00:02:39.090
Hasan sabar

48
00:02:45.620 --> 00:02:50.280
Hassan and his followers emerged in a confusing and a murky period

49
00:02:50.420 --> 00:02:53.680
of political, ethnic, and religious strife in Persia.

50
00:02:53.900 --> 00:02:57.480
And the middle east a period is in which different Muslim factions force each

51
00:02:57.481 --> 00:03:01.680
other and also against the European crusaders. No wonder then the,

52
00:03:01.700 --> 00:03:04.520
the history emerging from that period is shrouded in myth,

53
00:03:04.950 --> 00:03:06.440
legends and propaganda.

54
00:03:06.700 --> 00:03:10.840
<v 1>So who were the assassins and what was their agenda also?</v>

55
00:03:10.841 --> 00:03:13.240
What was that relationship with the Knight's temper?

56
00:03:13.620 --> 00:03:16.880
Who was the mysterious old man of the mountain? Well,

57
00:03:16.881 --> 00:03:21.510
today I will try to clear these and other questions up by narrating Hassan's

58
00:03:21.540 --> 00:03:26.150
life. But first, how did the assassins legend get started in Europe?

59
00:03:32.770 --> 00:03:37.470
<v 0>One of the first written accounts about the assassins comes from a French priest</v>

60
00:03:37.790 --> 00:03:39.540
and historian living in, in Syria.

61
00:03:39.770 --> 00:03:43.060
This was William of TA in the early 1180s.

62
00:03:43.061 --> 00:03:47.860
William wrote in the province of TA is a certain people who have 10 castles and

63
00:03:48.220 --> 00:03:49.060
surrounding lands.

64
00:03:49.061 --> 00:03:54.020
And we have often heard that there are 60 thousands of them or more

65
00:03:54.300 --> 00:03:57.220
both we and the Saras call them assassins.

66
00:03:57.280 --> 00:03:59.890
But I don't know where the name comes from.

67
00:04:00.330 --> 00:04:04.690
The Europeans would have to wait until 1298 to learn more about this mysterious

68
00:04:04.700 --> 00:04:09.330
order. That's when TLO Deza published the travels of Marco polo,

69
00:04:09.590 --> 00:04:13.970
the Venetian traveler describes a lands called mul hat where an old man of the

70
00:04:14.050 --> 00:04:14.750
mountain used to live.

71
00:04:14.750 --> 00:04:19.090
The man had built the largest and most beautiful garden in the world.

72
00:04:19.510 --> 00:04:23.040
The three nows streams there, one for water, one Fannie,

73
00:04:23.260 --> 00:04:26.240
one for wine in the garden. There lived boys in maidens.

74
00:04:26.241 --> 00:04:29.960
The most handsome in the world in the garden were admitted.

75
00:04:30.190 --> 00:04:34.000
Only those whom the old man wanted to turn into his assassins.

76
00:04:34.100 --> 00:04:36.840
He drugged them with opium and upon waking up in the garden,

77
00:04:36.980 --> 00:04:40.440
he let them believe that they were experiencing a vision of heaven.

78
00:04:40.850 --> 00:04:44.630
The next time they woke up, the old man had brought them back to the real world,

79
00:04:44.820 --> 00:04:46.670
longing to return to that heaven.

80
00:04:46.671 --> 00:04:51.110
These young men were manipulated to become assassins on behalf of the old man,

81
00:04:51.460 --> 00:04:56.030
only death as a Marty for their cause would grant them a return to the garden of

82
00:04:56.031 --> 00:04:56.640
delights.

83
00:04:56.640 --> 00:05:00.430
Marco polo claims that it was for that reason that the assassins were such

84
00:05:00.431 --> 00:05:01.264
effective kill.

85
00:05:01.280 --> 00:05:05.100
And the old man was so feared that rulers in Asia would pay him a regular

86
00:05:05.460 --> 00:05:05.800
tribute.

87
00:05:05.800 --> 00:05:10.780
The alternative of course was death Polo's account concludes by narrating.

88
00:05:10.940 --> 00:05:15.220
How in 1265, the Lord of the tars allow tired of this wickedness.

89
00:05:15.221 --> 00:05:16.060
He laid siege,

90
00:05:16.061 --> 00:05:20.140
the old man's fortres for three years before starving out the man of the

91
00:05:20.260 --> 00:05:22.290
mountain and all of his assassins.

92
00:05:22.510 --> 00:05:27.050
But how much of Marco Polo's accounts is the truth and how much is legend

93
00:05:27.470 --> 00:05:30.290
or even slander circulated by enemies? Well,

94
00:05:30.500 --> 00:05:34.690
we'll find out right now because now enters the picture Hasan sabar

95
00:05:41.250 --> 00:05:44.840
Hasan sabar was born in the year 10 50 in H in modern day. Iran,

96
00:05:45.400 --> 00:05:50.120
Juan was and still is considered as one of the holiest cities in Shia

97
00:05:50.210 --> 00:05:53.480
Islam and the leading center for Muslim scholarship in Persia,

98
00:05:53.740 --> 00:05:58.600
his father Ali bin Mohammed bin Jafar Albar Almari was originally

99
00:05:59.160 --> 00:06:03.040
Yemeni and belonged to the Twelver tradition of Shia Islam after Hassan's birth,

100
00:06:03.360 --> 00:06:07.600
the S Saar family settled down in Ray where the young Hassan received his early

101
00:06:07.840 --> 00:06:11.520
religious education in accordance to his father's creed. Now,

102
00:06:11.521 --> 00:06:14.920
before he continue, allow me to clarify some religious terms here, for example,

103
00:06:15.030 --> 00:06:19.550
what is the difference between Shia and Sonny Muslims while these two factions

104
00:06:19.551 --> 00:06:23.910
share many spiritual beliefs and religious practices as that sch was actually

105
00:06:23.911 --> 00:06:27.590
political in nature after the death of Muhammad in 632,

106
00:06:27.730 --> 00:06:32.710
his advisor Abu beak became the first call for the successor of the prophet

107
00:06:32.860 --> 00:06:36.070
task with leading the Islamic nation, but his leadership,

108
00:06:36.170 --> 00:06:38.460
it was challenged by the followers of Ali,

109
00:06:38.680 --> 00:06:40.980
the prophet's cousin and his son-in-law.

110
00:06:41.050 --> 00:06:45.220
This action originated the sheer sec to believe that the leadership of the

111
00:06:45.221 --> 00:06:48.660
Islamic nation belongs to the direct descendants of the prophet.

112
00:06:48.920 --> 00:06:49.753
On the other hand,

113
00:06:49.980 --> 00:06:54.300
Sonny Muslims believe that the leadership of the community is not a birthright.

114
00:06:54.360 --> 00:06:57.890
It can, and it must be earned a 12.

115
00:06:57.930 --> 00:07:00.570
A tradition is the mainstream belief among shes.

116
00:07:00.790 --> 00:07:04.250
It is called 12 in reference to the 12 successes of Mohamed.

117
00:07:04.310 --> 00:07:09.130
The last of which Mohamed IBAN Hassan Almadi is yet to return to

118
00:07:09.150 --> 00:07:11.450
become mankind savior. The city of Ray,

119
00:07:11.451 --> 00:07:14.810
where young Hassan lived was at the center of another sheer current, the,

120
00:07:14.930 --> 00:07:17.890
as Israelis, they derived their name from their allegiance to Ismail.

121
00:07:18.180 --> 00:07:22.640
The eldest son of IAM Jafa as Sadiq Israelis are the second largest

122
00:07:22.720 --> 00:07:24.880
denomination within Shia Islam.

123
00:07:24.900 --> 00:07:29.040
And so what differentiates them from other sheer occurrences is that they have a

124
00:07:29.041 --> 00:07:33.880
living hereditary IAM in Ray Hassan was introduced to Thema doctrine

125
00:07:33.900 --> 00:07:38.790
by two prominent dies or missionaries Amira Zab ands abbu ne uh,

126
00:07:39.230 --> 00:07:39.300
SRA.

127
00:07:39.300 --> 00:07:43.790
Following these studies at the age of 17 Hassan converted to Ima and took an

128
00:07:43.791 --> 00:07:46.670
oath of allegiance to the Ima IAM of the time.

129
00:07:46.970 --> 00:07:49.790
The fated Kali Al Angia,

130
00:07:49.970 --> 00:07:54.270
the fat mid dynasty ruled the most powerful Muslim state of the era from their

131
00:07:54.271 --> 00:07:55.470
capital in Cairo,

132
00:07:55.500 --> 00:08:00.060
despite their power FATTOM mids were under constant threat from the CEL tucks.

133
00:08:00.200 --> 00:08:03.940
The CELs were another powerful dynasty originating from central Asia.

134
00:08:04.170 --> 00:08:04.701
From there,

135
00:08:04.701 --> 00:08:08.860
they had swept through Persia and in the middle east establishing a Sonny salt,

136
00:08:09.180 --> 00:08:13.580
eight Aly converted Smail student asanas age 22 had ventured into these

137
00:08:13.780 --> 00:08:17.660
territories managing to impress Abbot Al Malik IBAN Atash,

138
00:08:17.720 --> 00:08:22.650
who was the chief as male lead die in the CEL Salate he impressed him so

139
00:08:22.651 --> 00:08:27.490
much that he actually got a job as a missionary as well in this tele role Hassan

140
00:08:27.491 --> 00:08:32.050
first traveled to the secret Persian Ismaili headquarters in is Fahan in

141
00:08:32.110 --> 00:08:34.170
Persia deep in CEL territory.

142
00:08:34.270 --> 00:08:38.410
He then went to Cairo and Alexandria to perfect his education during his

143
00:08:38.411 --> 00:08:43.240
Egyptian period Hassan, clay Ash, with some big shots in the Smail organization,

144
00:08:43.420 --> 00:08:44.280
one in particular,

145
00:08:44.460 --> 00:08:49.000
the vier or chief minister to the fat mid court Al AAL the conflict

146
00:08:49.001 --> 00:08:54.000
revolved around the succession to the caliphate and by extension to the alate.

147
00:08:54.140 --> 00:08:57.680
In other words, who would be the next leader of the Israelis?

148
00:08:58.160 --> 00:09:03.080
The current CA Al must had appointed as future successor, his eldest son,

149
00:09:03.260 --> 00:09:05.520
the IAM NAZA on the other hand,

150
00:09:05.920 --> 00:09:10.560
VI Al AF was lobbying to install NAZA's younger. Brother must Starley.

151
00:09:10.630 --> 00:09:12.640
This guy also happened to be his son-in-law.

152
00:09:13.000 --> 00:09:15.670
Her son had provided his to NAZA,

153
00:09:15.671 --> 00:09:20.150
which made him an enemy to the powerful VI the outcome of this whole intrigue.

154
00:09:20.160 --> 00:09:24.470
First of all, a further sch within Islam with NAZA Isma. Now,

155
00:09:24.471 --> 00:09:29.470
rivaling must IMAS. Second outcome Hassan was exiled by Al after,

156
00:09:29.730 --> 00:09:32.750
and he returned to Persia in June of 10 81,

157
00:09:33.010 --> 00:09:37.580
but by now he had become the most prominent die for the nascent NAZA community.

158
00:09:44.020 --> 00:09:44.910
Over the following years,

159
00:09:45.390 --> 00:09:49.630
Sam traveled all across Persia spreading word of the NAZA's during this period,

160
00:09:49.970 --> 00:09:54.030
he increased his following and he started drawing up his plans to get rid of the

161
00:09:54.230 --> 00:09:55.390
Sandra occupation of his land.

162
00:09:55.650 --> 00:09:59.580
But what had motivated Heran sabar in revolting against the CELs? Well,

163
00:09:59.581 --> 00:10:03.180
he actually had three different sets of reasons from a religious perspective,

164
00:10:03.400 --> 00:10:08.340
the ardently Sonny CELs did not hide their hostility against sheers of all

165
00:10:08.820 --> 00:10:13.140
secs and the NAZA's and his males may have feared for their own religious

166
00:10:13.141 --> 00:10:17.890
freedom. Politically Hasan still had an allegiance to the Egyptian fat meds,

167
00:10:18.120 --> 00:10:20.250
despite his exile, the CEL spike,

168
00:10:20.251 --> 00:10:24.810
the 10 seventies stretched as far as the Sai threatening to uproot the

169
00:10:24.811 --> 00:10:29.010
caliphate and nationally Hassan's revolt could have been an expression of the

170
00:10:29.040 --> 00:10:32.290
Persian's resentment over the alien rule of thes CEL.

171
00:10:32.680 --> 00:10:36.450
TURs I'm pretty sure that Hassan had never read son Sue yet.

172
00:10:36.550 --> 00:10:40.120
The strategy he formulated, it was pure art of war.

173
00:10:40.260 --> 00:10:44.080
He frankly assessed the weaknesses of his faction and the weaknesses of the

174
00:10:44.081 --> 00:10:44.620
Celtics.

175
00:10:44.620 --> 00:10:49.120
The NAZA were heavily outnumbered while CEL leaders were scattered around the

176
00:10:49.310 --> 00:10:50.720
vast Persian territory.

177
00:10:50.820 --> 00:10:53.320
So how could he multiply the effectiveness of his forces?

178
00:10:53.500 --> 00:10:57.480
How could he deal severe blows to the occupies without St.

179
00:10:57.630 --> 00:11:00.350
Pitch battles on a dispersive territory?

180
00:11:00.570 --> 00:11:04.310
His answer was to quickly occupy the high grounds and establish a series of

181
00:11:04.311 --> 00:11:08.350
impregnable mountain strongholds from which to launch targeted killings of

182
00:11:08.351 --> 00:11:12.350
political and military top brass all around the country. And as you can see,

183
00:11:12.450 --> 00:11:15.110
the assassin creed was beginning to take shape

184
00:11:20.800 --> 00:11:21.820
By 10 87.

185
00:11:21.840 --> 00:11:25.900
Hassan had concentrated his efforts for recruiting a resistance movement around

186
00:11:26.040 --> 00:11:30.300
the Daum region, a traditional sheer stronghold by September of 10 90,

187
00:11:30.540 --> 00:11:35.340
had taken control of the region and had seized the fortres of a mu the teaching

188
00:11:35.560 --> 00:11:40.290
of the Eagle located in the central ELs mountain in the rad bar region. He did.

189
00:11:40.291 --> 00:11:44.890
So by coming and peaceful means converting in secret one by one,

190
00:11:44.950 --> 00:11:49.810
the soldiers of the local Garrison Hassan made the fortres impregnable and made

191
00:11:49.920 --> 00:11:54.800
self sufficient by improving the cultivation and irrigation systems of the Alamo

192
00:11:54.900 --> 00:11:57.280
valley. He also established an important library,

193
00:11:57.281 --> 00:12:01.680
holding a vast collection of manuscripts and scientific instruments after firmly

194
00:12:01.681 --> 00:12:05.600
establishing himself in ER Hassan extended his influence in the region by

195
00:12:05.601 --> 00:12:10.600
winning more converts and expanding his network of fortres in Rud bar in

196
00:12:10.601 --> 00:12:11.161
10 91,

197
00:12:11.161 --> 00:12:16.030
Hassan sent one of his followers is dye Husain quite any to Stan near the border

198
00:12:16.100 --> 00:12:17.670
with modern day Afghanistan,

199
00:12:18.230 --> 00:12:23.030
Huan was successful in starting a popular uprising among local sheers seeking

200
00:12:23.031 --> 00:12:24.470
independence from the Celtics.

201
00:12:24.540 --> 00:12:28.790
This allow the NAZA's to gain control of several towns in star in less than two

202
00:12:28.791 --> 00:12:33.260
years after the capture of Alamo Heran sabar had founded an independent T or

203
00:12:33.350 --> 00:12:37.660
state for the NAZA IMAS in the midst of the CEL sate,

204
00:12:43.840 --> 00:12:46.700
The Persian sheer population of course saw the CEL taxes,

205
00:12:46.820 --> 00:12:51.140
invaders under press sunny sauce begged to differ pointing to the fact that CELs

206
00:12:51.141 --> 00:12:55.250
tried to extend a friendly hand to the locals. Mallek sh for example,

207
00:12:55.310 --> 00:12:56.610
had appointed as his VI,

208
00:12:56.970 --> 00:13:00.530
a Persian abbu Ali Hassan bin Ali bin shark,

209
00:13:00.970 --> 00:13:05.890
better known as NAZA UL, which translates as the order of the country.

210
00:13:06.000 --> 00:13:10.970
According to legend Hassan and naan had been classmates and friends in their

211
00:13:10.971 --> 00:13:15.360
youth after becoming Visia NAZA had helped his old friends by securing him a

212
00:13:15.480 --> 00:13:18.960
post at the court of mal sharp, but soon their rivalry erupted.

213
00:13:18.961 --> 00:13:21.920
And Naar had conspired to have Hassan exalt.

214
00:13:21.990 --> 00:13:23.680
This legend would make Hassan's mission.

215
00:13:23.860 --> 00:13:27.880
One of personal revenge against his childhood friend who had betrayed him as

216
00:13:28.120 --> 00:13:31.400
romantic as the story sounds Naar was 32 years older than Hassan,

217
00:13:31.420 --> 00:13:34.320
and there wasn't any chance they could have been schoolmates.

218
00:13:34.650 --> 00:13:38.870
So what happens next was purely politically motivated in 10 92,

219
00:13:39.230 --> 00:13:43.750
NAZA launched a SEL counter attack against the NAZA's in OOS and queston,

220
00:13:43.810 --> 00:13:44.990
but Hassan's strategy.

221
00:13:45.130 --> 00:13:48.590
It proved effective his small Garrison a to the easily defendable mountain

222
00:13:48.700 --> 00:13:52.670
strongholds was able to repel attack after attack.

223
00:13:52.730 --> 00:13:54.910
During the siege of AMO Assan was,

224
00:13:55.260 --> 00:13:59.220
or to extract safely his wife and daughters to another his smiley community.

225
00:13:59.400 --> 00:14:00.420
He never brought them back,

226
00:14:00.421 --> 00:14:05.260
starting a tradition of not allowing women into the fortres Hasan's next move

227
00:14:05.280 --> 00:14:06.900
was to go on the offensive,

228
00:14:07.050 --> 00:14:10.940
lacking the numbers for a Fullon military campaign Hasan relied on his next

229
00:14:11.180 --> 00:14:15.340
favorite tactic, a targeted killing intended to decapitates CEL leader.

230
00:14:15.820 --> 00:14:19.090
Hasan picked the ADE or faithful who would carry out the mission.

231
00:14:19.890 --> 00:14:23.450
Boo Iran disguised as Aafia Muslim mystic.

232
00:14:23.690 --> 00:14:28.210
The FII approached the litter in which his target was traveling swift and

233
00:14:28.211 --> 00:14:32.170
silent. His dagger left its sheath and it plunged itself into Iran's target.

234
00:14:32.400 --> 00:14:36.360
This was NAZA Al Mor the died on spot,

235
00:14:36.500 --> 00:14:38.760
the same fate Beel to H Iran,

236
00:14:39.060 --> 00:14:43.560
he and the other FIS supremely accepted the facts that their emissions would be

237
00:14:43.561 --> 00:14:48.520
most likely suicidal. The FII was immediately cut down by NAZA's bodyguards.

238
00:14:48.630 --> 00:14:52.080
This was the first high profile assassination carried out by the faithful

239
00:14:52.120 --> 00:14:56.760
soldiers of the NAZA army Hassan and his two immediate successes ordered a total

240
00:14:56.780 --> 00:14:58.520
of 75 tactical killings,

241
00:14:58.620 --> 00:15:02.080
always aimed at high profile targets and never at civilians.

242
00:15:02.220 --> 00:15:06.440
The occupiers would often retaliate with massacres among the Israeli communities

243
00:15:06.441 --> 00:15:09.440
followed by further surgical strikes on Hassan's orders.

244
00:15:09.520 --> 00:15:12.030
Unsurprising in the actions of the fi dies,

245
00:15:12.080 --> 00:15:15.790
earns them the hatred of the CELs and a large part of the Sonny community.

246
00:15:16.060 --> 00:15:20.190
They painted them as radical extremists and pro terrorists.

247
00:15:20.191 --> 00:15:22.790
And at the same time as dissolute drug addicts,

248
00:15:22.900 --> 00:15:27.870
this is when the NAZA FIS became known as Hasian or assassins

249
00:15:27.890 --> 00:15:29.590
the users of hashish.

250
00:15:36.080 --> 00:15:36.940
So let's pause for a moment.

251
00:15:37.000 --> 00:15:41.380
Did the assassins or hash shins actually smoke hashish in reality,

252
00:15:41.410 --> 00:15:43.500
they never used that word to describe themselves.

253
00:15:43.710 --> 00:15:47.540
Their correct description would be the phai of the NAZA is mainly army.

254
00:15:47.760 --> 00:15:50.940
The name. It was stuck on them by Marco polo and William of Ty,

255
00:15:51.120 --> 00:15:53.370
who from the enemies of the NAZA in Syria.

256
00:15:53.710 --> 00:15:57.250
It is true that soldiers across time have made use of recreational and

257
00:15:57.251 --> 00:16:00.610
prescription drugs to get themselves in the right state for battle.

258
00:16:01.050 --> 00:16:02.650
But is a question for you. If you were a son,

259
00:16:02.651 --> 00:16:06.450
would you really trust a stoner with a delicate mission involving climbing

260
00:16:06.970 --> 00:16:09.970
castle walls, picking locks, invading gods, and stabbing a high profile enemy?

261
00:16:10.190 --> 00:16:11.930
And how about them dealing with a munchies? I mean, sure.

262
00:16:12.280 --> 00:16:15.520
All the Stoner's best friends is the Kaba and that was invented by Turk

263
00:16:15.521 --> 00:16:18.400
soldiers, but that wasn't until 1377.

264
00:16:19.680 --> 00:16:23.280
So it's not disputed that the word assassin actually comes from hashish,

265
00:16:23.340 --> 00:16:27.480
but it is now accepted that these highly skilled and trained warriors were not

266
00:16:27.580 --> 00:16:28.001
on drugs.

267
00:16:28.001 --> 00:16:32.480
They simply found themselves stuck with a slur thrown on them by then you

268
00:16:32.750 --> 00:16:33.490
numerous enemies.

269
00:16:33.490 --> 00:16:36.710
And it did not help that the slur was a strong sounding word assassin,

270
00:16:36.720 --> 00:16:41.230
which was quickly adopted by popular European poets in the 13th and 14th

271
00:16:41.231 --> 00:16:44.550
centuries. One being Dante, the author of the divine comedy,

272
00:16:44.930 --> 00:16:46.430
but enough with the word of the day,

273
00:16:46.431 --> 00:16:48.790
let's get down to business to defeat the tur

274
00:16:55.130 --> 00:16:57.700
Shortly after the assassination of Nizam Al mul,

275
00:16:57.840 --> 00:17:02.260
the SEL Salton Malik sh also died. The causes remain mysterious.

276
00:17:02.350 --> 00:17:05.620
Maybe they were natural, or maybe he was poisoned. As a result.

277
00:17:05.621 --> 00:17:09.540
The sate was plunged into chaos and a civil war between Malik, eldest,

278
00:17:09.680 --> 00:17:10.513
son Burkey,

279
00:17:10.800 --> 00:17:15.490
and his brother Sonja supported by their half brother Mohamed Tepa took

280
00:17:15.491 --> 00:17:20.490
place. The state was further fractured by the emergence of independent wars,

281
00:17:20.491 --> 00:17:22.370
taking advantage of the disorder,

282
00:17:22.970 --> 00:17:27.050
Hassan consolidated and extended his power seizing more strategically located

283
00:17:27.090 --> 00:17:31.930
fortress extending as far as dam gun 500 kilometers to the east of the Alamo

284
00:17:31.931 --> 00:17:32.764
headquarters,

285
00:17:32.950 --> 00:17:37.840
or even to KU Astan a thousand kilometers to the south Hassan.

286
00:17:38.260 --> 00:17:40.160
He was unstoppable during this period.

287
00:17:40.300 --> 00:17:44.640
He consolidated his reputation as an Auste and aesthetic leader in a short span

288
00:17:44.641 --> 00:17:45.020
of time.

289
00:17:45.020 --> 00:17:49.120
We don't know exactly when he had both of his sons executed Mohamed was guilty

290
00:17:49.121 --> 00:17:53.040
of drinking wine. While AAD was a suspect in the death of Hassan's loyal,

291
00:17:53.041 --> 00:17:57.880
left tenant Husain ke the Nazari leader personally turned inwards,

292
00:17:57.900 --> 00:17:59.920
but politically he sought expansion.

293
00:18:00.180 --> 00:18:03.200
It is said that he never again left his castle,

294
00:18:03.201 --> 00:18:04.880
but in the early years of the 12th century,

295
00:18:05.350 --> 00:18:10.230
Asan began sending his dies from Alamo in Des Syria here in the NAZA's

296
00:18:10.231 --> 00:18:13.390
resumed their practice of establishing mountain strongholds.

297
00:18:13.450 --> 00:18:18.350
The most important one was the mass fortres years later Macia would be under

298
00:18:18.370 --> 00:18:23.070
the commands of Rasht at D he achieved fame due to his numerous attempts to

299
00:18:23.390 --> 00:18:24.430
assassinate Saladin.

300
00:18:24.490 --> 00:18:28.790
And it was he not a son who gave rise to the legend of the old man of the

301
00:18:28.950 --> 00:18:30.060
mounts. And it was them,

302
00:18:30.160 --> 00:18:33.740
the Syrian assassins who would first make contact with the temp.

303
00:18:40.460 --> 00:18:43.820
I will take a quick detour now to cover the relationship between these two

304
00:18:43.821 --> 00:18:46.660
groups. Even if it's outta the scope of Hassan's life,

305
00:18:46.940 --> 00:18:51.890
a certain media franchises painted these two as mortal rivals through the

306
00:18:52.000 --> 00:18:56.450
ages and across continents. These two factions had much in common though.

307
00:18:56.470 --> 00:18:57.303
If you think about it,

308
00:18:57.360 --> 00:19:02.130
both were a core of elite warriors motivated by both a political and a

309
00:19:02.250 --> 00:19:03.000
religious drive.

310
00:19:03.000 --> 00:19:07.250
Both would be at some point slandered and accused of being heretics by powerful

311
00:19:07.251 --> 00:19:09.930
enemies. The tension between assassins and temples in,

312
00:19:10.240 --> 00:19:13.720
in the LA van saw the holy lands, never escalated into a full clash.

313
00:19:13.850 --> 00:19:15.760
There were some hostilities, but the two,

314
00:19:15.761 --> 00:19:20.200
sometimes they were allies as the Syrian NAZA were more interested in fighting

315
00:19:20.250 --> 00:19:24.200
other Muslim enemies rather than the Christians from 1152,

316
00:19:24.201 --> 00:19:27.480
they interacted almost like mob cartels with assigned territories,

317
00:19:27.880 --> 00:19:31.030
wary of stepping too much on each other's toes in year.

318
00:19:31.050 --> 00:19:35.390
The fi days had claimed one of their few Christian victims count Raymond of

319
00:19:35.590 --> 00:19:36.710
triple E in reparation.

320
00:19:36.711 --> 00:19:40.670
The Templar in Lebanon demanded a tribute of 2000 BES a year.

321
00:19:40.810 --> 00:19:43.710
Sounds a bit like protection money. Doesn't it. On another occasion,

322
00:19:43.730 --> 00:19:47.870
it was the Syrian assassin who demanded protection money from none other than

323
00:19:47.980 --> 00:19:52.500
king Louis, the ninth, the France, when he was visiting AKA in modern day,

324
00:19:52.520 --> 00:19:56.100
Israel, if the king page, the old man of the mountain would let him live.

325
00:19:56.820 --> 00:20:00.740
Grand's master joined Villa of the tempo intervened and sent the ENVO back home

326
00:20:00.790 --> 00:20:05.060
empty handed with a nonaggression package between the king and the old man.

327
00:20:05.620 --> 00:20:08.420
But off we threw an in video games. Let's get back to her son, shall we?

328
00:20:14.870 --> 00:20:15.730
In 10 97,

329
00:20:15.790 --> 00:20:20.570
the IAM NAZA spiritual leader to his son and his men was killed in

330
00:20:20.620 --> 00:20:21.150
Cairo.

331
00:20:21.150 --> 00:20:25.690
His rival VI Al Al had buried him alive between two walls.

332
00:20:25.960 --> 00:20:27.250
When the news reached his son,

333
00:20:27.310 --> 00:20:31.370
he sent for NAZA's young son to be rescued from Cairo and to be brought to

334
00:20:31.371 --> 00:20:35.800
safety a mu until now, Hassan sabar had been the political ends,

335
00:20:35.920 --> 00:20:38.600
military leader of the NAZA and Persia from now on,

336
00:20:38.601 --> 00:20:40.320
in the absence of a manifesting mom,

337
00:20:40.500 --> 00:20:44.720
he would serve also as the religious leader of the whole NAZA community.

338
00:20:45.020 --> 00:20:46.480
In the last years of the 11th century,

339
00:20:46.540 --> 00:20:49.520
Hassan launched an offensive on the heart of the CEL.

340
00:20:50.200 --> 00:20:54.920
Salate the objective was the fortres of close to the capital of if

341
00:20:55.280 --> 00:20:58.640
Ahan his agent for the operation was AMA bin attached.

342
00:20:58.660 --> 00:21:02.240
The son of AANS first teacher after he had become, and his mainly,

343
00:21:02.580 --> 00:21:06.440
but AMA did not use the dagger only as faith. One by one,

344
00:21:06.810 --> 00:21:10.830
he converted the children and then the soldiers of the Garrison by 1100,

345
00:21:11.150 --> 00:21:15.390
a Martin, the NAZA's had successfully infiltrated and occupied the castle.

346
00:21:15.410 --> 00:21:18.390
And with that, the road to Ferhan was open,

347
00:21:18.690 --> 00:21:21.710
but eventually the Nazari did not achieve victory,

348
00:21:22.010 --> 00:21:26.550
at least not a total one. In the meantime, the Warings CEL brothers Burkey,

349
00:21:26.910 --> 00:21:31.060
San and Mohamed DEPA had agreed to a truce in order to combat Heran.

350
00:21:31.200 --> 00:21:35.980
The newly United Celtics fought back and secured is Fahan the Nazari retaliated

351
00:21:36.050 --> 00:21:37.260
with more assassinations,

352
00:21:37.261 --> 00:21:42.220
which were followed by massacres of Nazari civilians in 1105 to

353
00:21:42.380 --> 00:21:45.900
par became the Salton four years later, he launched a second siege.

354
00:21:46.140 --> 00:21:49.650
Val Moi go to close Asari nuisance once. And for all that,

355
00:21:49.651 --> 00:21:53.650
the heads of his army was AMA Al the son of the Viza,

356
00:21:53.651 --> 00:21:56.370
who was assassinated in 10 92. But once again,

357
00:21:57.010 --> 00:22:01.170
AMO held on by assault or Tian AMO. He would not fall

358
00:22:07.390 --> 00:22:11.040
The ongoing war or had reached a Stal mate by the time of Moham to PA's death in

359
00:22:11.041 --> 00:22:14.920
1118, the NAZA's were still successfully defending important,

360
00:22:15.480 --> 00:22:19.800
albeit scattered territories, which amounted to an independent Nazari state,

361
00:22:19.900 --> 00:22:23.520
but a total victory and conquest of Persia from the hands of the CEL.

362
00:22:24.060 --> 00:22:26.640
It was outta the question in these years of STAM mate,

363
00:22:26.740 --> 00:22:30.430
her son withdrew even more from the side world spending most of his time inside

364
00:22:30.431 --> 00:22:32.870
his personal quarters at AUT reading books,

365
00:22:32.880 --> 00:22:36.670
committing the teachings of his doctrine to writing and administering the

366
00:22:36.671 --> 00:22:38.670
affairs of his realm in 1124,

367
00:22:38.910 --> 00:22:42.030
age 74 Hassan sense that he was reaching the end of his life.

368
00:22:42.210 --> 00:22:44.070
He summoned ki Bazo Omid,

369
00:22:44.230 --> 00:22:48.830

371
00:22:53.461 --> 00:22:55.100
and was buried near AU.

372
00:22:55.200 --> 00:22:59.620
The fortres that had been his home and the symbol of his power for so many

373
00:22:59.621 --> 00:23:02.380
years, the Nazari for dies or assassins.

374
00:23:02.400 --> 00:23:06.540
If you like continued to harass the Celtics and other fo in Persia for the

375

following 100 years,

376
00:23:09.060 --> 00:23:13.210
NAZA worshipers regularly visited Assan Moza Liam until a new unstoppable enemy

377
00:23:13.460 --> 00:23:17.730
swept through central Asia and Persia. And that was the Mongols in 1256,

378
00:23:17.731 --> 00:23:21.050
they laid the final siege to AMO the proud fortres.

379
00:23:21.070 --> 00:23:25.050
The teaching of the Eagle eventually fell and was demolished the assassins.

380
00:23:25.051 --> 00:23:26.290
They remained active in Syria,

381
00:23:26.510 --> 00:23:31.120
