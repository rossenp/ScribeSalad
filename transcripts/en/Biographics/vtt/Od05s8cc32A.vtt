<v 0>This video is brought to you by Blinkus the first 100 people to go to</v>

00:00:03.391 --> 00:00:06.870
blinkist.com forward slash biographics. So you're at a week to try it out.

3
00:00:06.871 --> 00:00:10.110
You'll also get 25% off if you want the full membership,

4
00:00:10.111 --> 00:00:12.570
which you probably will, and let's get into it.

5
00:00:19.370 --> 00:00:20.540
The 1977,

6
00:00:20.541 --> 00:00:24.440
a 47 year old former wall street analyst made California history.

7
00:00:24.620 --> 00:00:28.580
Harvey milk was the first openly gay man to be elected to public office in the

8
00:00:28.581 --> 00:00:29.540
sunshine state.

9
00:00:29.541 --> 00:00:33.860
And one of the first in the entire United States at a time when public workers

10
00:00:33.861 --> 00:00:38.570
were still being fired for homosexuality milk showed that you could be not just,

11
00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:44.120
but openly defiantly, radically, and still win votes.

12
00:00:44.270 --> 00:00:48.110
It was an iconic moments in both gay history and American history in general,

13
00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:48.831
sadly,

14
00:00:48.831 --> 00:00:52.820
it was shortly followed by another moment that was iconic for all the wrong

15
00:00:52.821 --> 00:00:57.440
reasons. Almost exactly a year after winning election milk was assassinated,

16
00:00:57.500 --> 00:01:00.590
gunned down in his office by a former colleague.

17
00:01:00.650 --> 00:01:03.140
But while everyone knows the story of Harvey milk,

18
00:01:03.141 --> 00:01:07.790
San Francisco icon and gay martyr, how much do they know about Harvey?

19
00:01:07.791 --> 00:01:10.790
Milk's a man born into a Jewish family in 1930.

20
00:01:10.791 --> 00:01:13.340
Milk grew up at a time of virulent homophobia.

21
00:01:13.610 --> 00:01:15.410
Initially hiding behind a tough guy act.

22
00:01:15.411 --> 00:01:20.150
He finally grew to accept who he was only to discover that this openness had

23
00:01:20.151 --> 00:01:23.810
tragic consequences, a complex sometimes troubled figure.

24
00:01:24.050 --> 00:01:27.800
This is the story of Harvey milk as a man who became the mater.

25
00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:30.073
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

26
00:01:34.130 --> 00:01:37.130
<v 0>When Harvey milk was born on the 22nd of May, 1930,</v>

27
00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:41.210
it was into a time and place that didn't want him to even exist.

28
00:01:41.270 --> 00:01:42.500
The part of long islands,

29
00:01:42.650 --> 00:01:46.340
his Jewish parents lived in had recently been a stronghold of the KKK and

30
00:01:47.510 --> 00:01:50.330
antisemitism was still just an accepted fact of life.

31
00:01:50.420 --> 00:01:53.570
Although the milks were able to run a department store and go to synagogue.

32
00:01:53.750 --> 00:01:58.010
Harvey would spend his school years excluded by the local rich kids for his

33
00:01:58.011 --> 00:01:58.844
Jewishness.

34
00:01:59.150 --> 00:02:02.120
And while milk's religion certainly made him a target for the chronically

35
00:02:02.121 --> 00:02:06.020
ignorance. It had nothing on his sexuality from an early age.

36
00:02:06.080 --> 00:02:09.860
Harvey milk was deeply aware that he was gay for a respectable family.

37
00:02:09.861 --> 00:02:13.250
In the 1930s. This was a major no-no milk's father.

38
00:02:13.251 --> 00:02:17.120
William seems to have been suspicious of his son and constantly berated him,

39
00:02:17.300 --> 00:02:22.130
trying to force him to man up and act straight milk soon learned to do

40
00:02:22.310 --> 00:02:24.680
as his father demanded the boy wasn't stupid.

41
00:02:24.920 --> 00:02:27.890
He'd seen what happens to the feminine kids at school. That's uh,

42
00:02:27.950 --> 00:02:32.420
to just go with the flow, to be the man his father wanted him to be.

43
00:02:32.480 --> 00:02:36.290
This has meant assuming the role of a teenage jock, immense of playing football,

44
00:02:36.320 --> 00:02:39.410
baseball, and hanging out with pretty girls butts.

45
00:02:39.440 --> 00:02:44.420
A roll was all it ever was a mask that Harvey tried to tell the world was his

46
00:02:44.421 --> 00:02:49.040
real face inside though. He was in turmoil at that time.

47
00:02:49.041 --> 00:02:52.580
Harvey's parents lived near a road leading to the ferry to fire Island.

48
00:02:52.760 --> 00:02:54.710
They notorious gay pickup spot.

49
00:02:54.770 --> 00:02:58.220
Teenage Harvey would see gay men returning at night and watch them from his

50
00:02:58.221 --> 00:03:00.910
bedroom window desperately wishing that he could join them.

51
00:03:01.210 --> 00:03:05.380
But the narrow pane of glass separating them may as well have been a concrete

52
00:03:05.381 --> 00:03:08.740
wall. At some point, the confused milk went to see the family rabbi.

53
00:03:08.980 --> 00:03:12.610
When they were alone, the boy broke down and confessed to homosexuality.

54
00:03:12.970 --> 00:03:16.840
The rabbis reply with something milkweed. Remember until the day he died,

55
00:03:17.080 --> 00:03:20.680
you shouldn't be concerned about how you live your life. The rabbi said,

56
00:03:20.980 --> 00:03:24.490
as long as you feel you're living it right, even now,

57
00:03:24.491 --> 00:03:27.880
this would be a progressive statement in the 1940s.

58
00:03:27.910 --> 00:03:30.610
It was like the rabbi blasting out. Donna Summers,

59
00:03:30.611 --> 00:03:35.520
I feel love while wearing a rainbow flag comforting as these words were they,

60
00:03:35.521 --> 00:03:39.790
they definitely weren't mainstream opinion. In the summer of 1947,

61
00:03:39.791 --> 00:03:42.580
the teenage milk visited a cruising spot for the first time,

62
00:03:42.610 --> 00:03:47.020
going to parts of central park, where he knew gay men like to hang out,

63
00:03:47.140 --> 00:03:51.520
barely had he arrived before he was arrested and taken into custody for the 17

64
00:03:51.521 --> 00:03:55.120
year old, the experience was a living nightmare. He begs the officers,

65
00:03:55.121 --> 00:03:58.570
told them he was just a high school kid going for a walk that had made a

66
00:03:58.571 --> 00:04:02.620
mistake. Eventually they let him go. But the experience Scott milk,

67
00:04:03.010 --> 00:04:06.850
it learns the hard way exactly what sort of world he lived in a world,

68
00:04:06.880 --> 00:04:09.850
which considered being gay to be a crime.

69
00:04:09.970 --> 00:04:12.760
Now firmly back in the closet, no can roles.

70
00:04:12.761 --> 00:04:15.280
It's the New York state college for teachers there.

71
00:04:15.281 --> 00:04:19.210
He studied maths and languages while working as a sports editor of the local

72
00:04:19.211 --> 00:04:23.200
paper, but he also found time to make a trip that would change his life.

73
00:04:23.410 --> 00:04:26.500
And the winter of 1950 Harvey milk took a vacation in Cuba.

74
00:04:26.590 --> 00:04:30.340
This was Cuba before the revolution, before the military government of Battista,

75
00:04:30.670 --> 00:04:33.940
it was a free and open society for the 20 year olds milk.

76
00:04:34.180 --> 00:04:38.200
It was a revelation when he returned to the U S he stops writing about sports.

77
00:04:38.380 --> 00:04:41.380
He began writing instead about civil rights.

78
00:04:41.470 --> 00:04:44.230
It was the first step on the journey from Harvey milk,

79
00:04:44.350 --> 00:04:48.250
that closeted gay men to Harvey milk the radical activist,

80
00:04:48.310 --> 00:04:51.550
but make no mistake. We're still a very long way to go.

81
00:04:57.570 --> 00:04:57.930
<v 1>[Inaudible].</v>

82
00:04:57.930 --> 00:04:58.950
<v 0>In 1951,</v>

83
00:04:59.430 --> 00:05:03.330
Harvey left the teacher's college drift and directionless had originally hoped

84
00:05:03.331 --> 00:05:05.100
to continue his studies in German,

85
00:05:05.101 --> 00:05:09.900
but had flunked so badly that no language school would ever accept such a total

86
00:05:09.930 --> 00:05:12.600
dumb cough. Seeing his rudderless son William milk,

87
00:05:12.601 --> 00:05:14.520
decided to push the boy into doing something.

88
00:05:14.820 --> 00:05:18.810
Matt show something that would definitely whip the sissy out of him.

89
00:05:19.050 --> 00:05:20.910
He sends the milk off to join the Navy.

90
00:05:21.210 --> 00:05:24.810
If you've ever seen that Simpsons episode where Homer accidentally takes bar to

91
00:05:24.811 --> 00:05:28.890
a gay steel mill, just know this wasn't his real life equivalent.

92
00:05:31.800 --> 00:05:33.090
That is based in San Diego,

93
00:05:33.550 --> 00:05:35.310
milkman other gay men for the first time in his life.

94
00:05:35.520 --> 00:05:36.810
When he went out to drink in town,

95
00:05:36.811 --> 00:05:40.650
he discovered that his crisp uniform was an absolute dude, magnets,

96
00:05:40.680 --> 00:05:42.900
but we wouldn't want to suggest milk's Naval.

97
00:05:42.901 --> 00:05:45.330
Life was just one big coming out party.

98
00:05:45.570 --> 00:05:48.870
He wound up serving in the Korean war as a driving instructor on board,

99
00:05:48.871 --> 00:05:53.370
the USS Kidd or Walker, although he never saw action. He still nested himself.

100
00:05:53.371 --> 00:05:57.650
Some metals milk's life. As a sailor ended on February the seventh, 1955,

101
00:05:57.770 --> 00:06:01.820
he received an honorable discharge, not the dishonorable. One had laid to claim.

102
00:06:01.821 --> 00:06:05.690
He got for being gay and found himself once again, back in civilian life.

103
00:06:05.691 --> 00:06:09.050
And once again, rudderless, rather than go back to his parents,

104
00:06:09.350 --> 00:06:11.430
he moved to Los Angeles. It was out West.

105
00:06:11.540 --> 00:06:14.780
That milk connects two important people. The first was Susan Davis,

106
00:06:14.781 --> 00:06:18.290
a young Jewish girl who took to calling herself milk's hack.

107
00:06:18.350 --> 00:06:22.820
The second was Davis's other gay friends, John Holly, handsome and headstrong.

108
00:06:22.850 --> 00:06:25.190
John swept, Harvey milk, clean off his feet.

109
00:06:25.460 --> 00:06:29.900
Milk adored the man calling him a God. The two moved in together. First in LA,

110
00:06:30.020 --> 00:06:34.280
is that in Miami becoming partners with a speed that left milk dizzy.

111
00:06:34.400 --> 00:06:38.390
John was his first serious boyfriend. The first time he'd been in love,

112
00:06:38.540 --> 00:06:40.700
naturally milks thought it would last forever.

113
00:06:40.850 --> 00:06:45.800
But when does first love have a lost in early 1956 after belly a year

114
00:06:45.801 --> 00:06:48.020
together, John walked out of Harvey milk's life,

115
00:06:48.260 --> 00:06:51.560
leaving him alone in Miami at first milk, trying to make the best of it.

116
00:06:51.710 --> 00:06:54.650
He briefly haunted the gay bars of powder puff lane,

117
00:06:54.651 --> 00:06:58.670
but he soon got arrested and was charged with perversion on Israelis,

118
00:06:58.671 --> 00:07:01.910
say depressed stands, disillusioned milk returns along islands.

119
00:07:01.970 --> 00:07:05.840
The next few years passed in an aimless blur back home milk briefly worked as a

120
00:07:05.841 --> 00:07:09.740
teacher before meeting his second boyfriends. The 19 year olds, Joe Campbell,

121
00:07:09.830 --> 00:07:11.870
the two trying to fall into first start in Dallas,

122
00:07:11.871 --> 00:07:14.540
but Merrill felt they didn't like his Jewishness down in Texas.

123
00:07:14.541 --> 00:07:16.340
So the pair returned to New York,

124
00:07:16.430 --> 00:07:18.470
although their partnership would last for four years.

125
00:07:18.500 --> 00:07:21.800
Most of those were unhappy. Milk was simply too angry,

126
00:07:22.010 --> 00:07:26.060
too prone to treating the younger man like a wastrel son instead of a lover.

127
00:07:26.330 --> 00:07:29.720
As the years passed, Joe started seeing other men secretly at first,

128
00:07:29.721 --> 00:07:33.950
then almost openly for as part Harvey made a frankly embarrassing attempts to.

129
00:07:33.980 --> 00:07:36.980
So do you see Susan Davis finally in 1961,

130
00:07:37.280 --> 00:07:39.980
Joe officially kills the lifeless marriage.

131
00:07:40.040 --> 00:07:44.180
He moved out of Harvey's apartment vanishing from his life only now realizing

132
00:07:44.181 --> 00:07:47.480
what had lost milk wrote stacks of love letters, begging him to come back.

133
00:07:47.481 --> 00:07:51.650
And Joe just ignored them all in the wake of the breakup milk tried returning to

134
00:07:51.651 --> 00:07:56.210
Miami only to find himself back. Once again, in New York, his 1963 dawned,

135
00:07:56.540 --> 00:07:58.250
still feeling lost by now.

136
00:07:58.251 --> 00:08:01.910
He was 33 and nobody with no Korea and there's nothing behind him,

137
00:08:01.940 --> 00:08:06.530
but two failed relationships. However, all of that was about to change milk.

138
00:08:06.560 --> 00:08:07.460
Couldn't have known it yet,

139
00:08:07.461 --> 00:08:11.780
but he was just 12 short months away from a meeting that would transform his

140
00:08:11.781 --> 00:08:12.614
life.

141
00:08:18.670 --> 00:08:19.503
<v 2>[Inaudible].</v>

142
00:08:19.630 --> 00:08:22.120
<v 0>1964, felons milk at lost on sound financial footing.</v>

143
00:08:22.240 --> 00:08:25.300
Now working on wall street as a securities research analyst,

144
00:08:25.301 --> 00:08:27.340
he was making good money for the first time in his life.

145
00:08:27.520 --> 00:08:31.450
It was also getting seriously into conservative politics. Yep.

146
00:08:31.600 --> 00:08:34.630
Conservative politics. If you're a mental image of Harvey milk is some lefty.

147
00:08:34.631 --> 00:08:35.980
San Francisco liberal.

148
00:08:35.981 --> 00:08:40.480
You should know that he campaigns for Barry Goldwater at the 1964 election,

149
00:08:40.600 --> 00:08:42.160
always a supporter of free enterprise.

150
00:08:42.161 --> 00:08:46.660
Milk's homosexuality also made him deeply suspicious of government intrusion to

151
00:08:46.661 --> 00:08:50.050
him. The Republican party just seems like the natural fit,

152
00:08:50.170 --> 00:08:52.510
but while milk was leaning rightward, politically,

153
00:08:52.600 --> 00:08:55.090
he was also dating men who moved in very different.

154
00:08:55.890 --> 00:08:59.820
The first of these was Craig Rodwell, millions of activists. Now today,

155
00:08:59.910 --> 00:09:01.590
if according to the term gay power,

156
00:09:01.830 --> 00:09:05.490
although their relationship was briefings ended with Naga dumping Rodwell for

157
00:09:05.491 --> 00:09:06.480
giving him the clap.

158
00:09:06.690 --> 00:09:10.560
It exposed milk to a whole new world of gay activism as well.

159
00:09:10.570 --> 00:09:14.250
1960s milk would claim to be uninterested in Rockwell's campaigning.

160
00:09:14.430 --> 00:09:18.030
1970s milk would have no problem stealing his tactics.

161
00:09:18.210 --> 00:09:22.140
The second more consequential relationship milk formed was with Jack Galen

162
00:09:22.141 --> 00:09:24.360
McKinley. A pretty young thing of only 17.

163
00:09:24.690 --> 00:09:28.740
Galen was dating the 40 year old Tom Horgen. When milk LeWitt in my wave,

164
00:09:28.800 --> 00:09:31.770
this was something of a recurring theme in milk's relationships.

165
00:09:31.771 --> 00:09:33.120
The just legal boy,

166
00:09:33.150 --> 00:09:37.500
he could act as both a lover and a father figure to the Horgan seems to have

167
00:09:37.501 --> 00:09:40.110
cared about to being replaced. And Galen's affections.

168
00:09:40.290 --> 00:09:44.190
The off-Broadway director took a shine to Galen's new leather and he and milks

169
00:09:44.191 --> 00:09:45.270
soon became friends.

170
00:09:45.300 --> 00:09:48.450
The creative scene that surrounded the director was a natural fit for milk.

171
00:09:48.630 --> 00:09:51.600
While Galen worked on the technical side of our Horgan's plays,

172
00:09:51.720 --> 00:09:53.100
milk was given bit roles.

173
00:09:53.130 --> 00:09:56.250
The thrill of performance suited his flamboyant personality.

174
00:09:56.340 --> 00:10:00.090
He even managed to Pele his acting career and do a bit part in a film directed

175
00:10:00.240 --> 00:10:03.330
by Robert Downey, Sr that's right. Same dude. Harvey milk,

176
00:10:03.360 --> 00:10:05.520
totally hung around with iron man's dad.

177
00:10:05.760 --> 00:10:07.800
How's that for an Avenger stall across I,

178
00:10:08.040 --> 00:10:09.930
that the longer milk stayed with Galen,

179
00:10:09.960 --> 00:10:12.840
the more he began to abandon his wall street image,

180
00:10:13.020 --> 00:10:16.800
he started wearing his hair long, began attending anti-Vietnam war protests.

181
00:10:16.830 --> 00:10:20.220
Finally, in the summer of 1969, he did what all hippies do.

182
00:10:20.640 --> 00:10:24.270
He moved to San Francisco. The catalyst was the production of Heather's.

183
00:10:24.420 --> 00:10:28.620
A Horgan was directing in the city and which Gaylen was part of the crucial

184
00:10:29.190 --> 00:10:30.150
organ, invited milk along.

185
00:10:30.151 --> 00:10:34.350
And he accepted abandoning his well-paid job for a life of creativity and flower

186
00:10:34.351 --> 00:10:36.990
power. At least that was the plan.

187
00:10:37.170 --> 00:10:40.280
The reality was that there was no paid role for knock on has.

188
00:10:40.281 --> 00:10:44.160
So we wound up cutting off his ponytail and taking a well-paid job in San

189
00:10:44.161 --> 00:10:45.990
Francisco at an investment bank.

190
00:10:46.140 --> 00:10:49.620
It wasn't quite the summer of love that milk was expecting still.

191
00:10:49.650 --> 00:10:52.230
The important point is that this was it.

192
00:10:52.290 --> 00:10:55.950
The moments that Harvey milk laid eyes on San Francisco,

193
00:10:56.250 --> 00:10:58.890
and it was love at first sight in the city's volume, brick,

194
00:10:58.920 --> 00:11:01.980
Gacy milk found something that had been missing in New York.

195
00:11:02.040 --> 00:11:06.300
There was something about how people in San Fran were just so in your face.

196
00:11:06.301 --> 00:11:09.360
So unapologetic, he may have rejected rod Wells,

197
00:11:09.361 --> 00:11:11.310
gay militancy while they were dating,

198
00:11:11.311 --> 00:11:14.310
but now Harvey milk was wholeheartedly embracing activism,

199
00:11:14.400 --> 00:11:17.850
but it was only a brief of fad that milk had with the city that, yeah,

200
00:11:17.851 --> 00:11:20.460
just a quick fling. In spring of 1970,

201
00:11:20.461 --> 00:11:24.000
he got fired from his new job for attending an anti-Wall rally with Oregon

202
00:11:24.060 --> 00:11:27.480
heading back to New York. He decided to, again, tag along,

203
00:11:27.540 --> 00:11:31.260
but this was not the end of Harvey milk and San Francisco's relationship.

204
00:11:31.320 --> 00:11:34.440
Even as he headed East milk, knew that he would be coming back.

205
00:11:34.500 --> 00:11:37.650
When he finally did, he was going to transform this city.

206
00:11:37.880 --> 00:11:41.690
If you're looking to transform yourself a great way to do that can be with

207
00:11:41.691 --> 00:11:46.370
knowledge. And that brings me to today's sponsor link guest. Now, look,

208
00:11:46.371 --> 00:11:49.730
it's not always easy to find the time to sit down and read all the books he

209
00:11:49.731 --> 00:11:52.850
wants or even listen to the audio book versions, because those can be pretty.

210
00:11:53.560 --> 00:11:55.900
I'm a busy dude. I understand that.

211
00:11:55.990 --> 00:12:00.220
I don't read nearly as much as I used to nearly as much as I would like to,

212
00:12:00.221 --> 00:12:03.580
but good news. I've got Blinkus. This is an app that you can download.

213
00:12:03.581 --> 00:12:04.151
And then on,

214
00:12:04.151 --> 00:12:07.450
there is 15 minutes summaries of all the best non-fiction books they've got over

215
00:12:07.750 --> 00:12:10.750
3000 of them in there. May I, uh,

216
00:12:10.780 --> 00:12:13.300
I tend to listen to the summaries most of the time,

217
00:12:13.301 --> 00:12:17.980
although sometimes I'll dive into the ends of the, uh, into the return section,

218
00:12:17.981 --> 00:12:20.800
but I just find 50 minutes. It's pretty great for, you know,

219
00:12:20.890 --> 00:12:24.640
listening to on the commute to work or while I'm doing some mindless things

220
00:12:24.641 --> 00:12:27.970
around the house, they're all 12 million active users on Blinkist, by the way,

221
00:12:28.180 --> 00:12:32.770
getting the best insights and need to know information from thousands of books,

222
00:12:32.950 --> 00:12:36.250
business to health. Self-help, whatever you're into.

223
00:12:36.640 --> 00:12:39.730
It's all along that they've also got these great curated lists where the

224
00:12:40.140 --> 00:12:42.310
Blinkist team have gone through and they've put together specific

225
00:12:42.311 --> 00:12:43.450
recommendations. Uh,

226
00:12:43.480 --> 00:12:47.350
some of these like how to future-proof yourself and there's other ones just kind

227
00:12:47.351 --> 00:12:50.710
of staff favorite, stuff like that. And of course you can download,

228
00:12:50.890 --> 00:12:54.130
listen offline. What have I been, I've been going through, I've got facts,

229
00:12:54.430 --> 00:12:56.950
wellness here. I actually finished that one already. Um, uh,

230
00:12:56.980 --> 00:13:00.250
the snowball Warren Buffett's book. I mean not his book,

231
00:13:00.280 --> 00:13:03.400
but about Warren buffet, total recall bomb resource nugget,

232
00:13:03.420 --> 00:13:06.190
his biography autobiography. That's a great one. Anyway,

blinkist.com forward slash biographics and let's return to today's video.

237
00:13:27.570 --> 00:13:28.403
<v 1>Holding milk Fest.</v>

238
00:13:28.590 --> 00:13:31.920
<v 0>Old friends. He plans to become mayor of San Francisco as early as November,</v>

239
00:13:31.921 --> 00:13:32.940
1969.

240
00:13:33.120 --> 00:13:37.770
But it wasn't until 1972 that he actually did anything about it that year.

241
00:13:37.800 --> 00:13:40.890
He moved back to the city with his new boyfriend's Joseph Scott Smith,

242
00:13:41.040 --> 00:13:44.250
who had met on the New York subway on his 41st birthday.

243
00:13:44.850 --> 00:13:46.800
Bankwest milk initially planned to open a Jewish deli,

244
00:13:46.801 --> 00:13:48.360
but he couldn't get the funds together.

245
00:13:48.361 --> 00:13:51.750
And instead settled on a camera shop located on Castro street.

246
00:13:51.751 --> 00:13:55.050
The shop was right in front of the beating heart of San Francisco's growing gay

247
00:13:55.051 --> 00:13:55.884
community.

248
00:13:55.920 --> 00:14:00.060
And it was exactly where Milt wanted to be as a now openly gay man with a

249
00:14:00.061 --> 00:14:03.840
friendly theatrical personality, running a store in the middle of the gay scene.

250
00:14:04.140 --> 00:14:06.270
Milk naturally became a local icon.

251
00:14:06.330 --> 00:14:09.690
There's some evidence that this was his plan all along and before his store,

252
00:14:09.780 --> 00:14:14.250
it even been open a year milk who was filing to run in the 1973 election for the

253
00:14:14.251 --> 00:14:15.690
city's board of supervisors.

254
00:14:15.900 --> 00:14:18.420
But if bell could expect it to instantly reach high office,

255
00:14:18.720 --> 00:14:22.140
it was doomed to disappointments. The local Democrat party turned him down,

256
00:14:22.170 --> 00:14:26.490
memorably telling him you don't get to dance unless you put up the chairs and

257
00:14:26.491 --> 00:14:28.560
I've never seen you put up the chairs.

258
00:14:28.650 --> 00:14:31.710
The more established gay activists also refuse to work with him.

259
00:14:31.711 --> 00:14:36.210
Seeing milk is some New York loud mouth trying to muscle in on that tough,

260
00:14:36.300 --> 00:14:39.690
still milk. Wasn't a tenant. He gamely ran regardless,

261
00:14:39.691 --> 00:14:42.510
trying to pull together an Alliance of marginalized groups,

262
00:14:42.540 --> 00:14:46.140
trying to touch on issues that affected not only LGBT people,

263
00:14:46.141 --> 00:14:50.460
but also Hispanics, the black community, the working class and senior citizens,

264
00:14:50.670 --> 00:14:52.370
while it enough to get him elected.

265
00:14:52.550 --> 00:14:56.480
It was enough to place him at respectable 10th out of 32,

266
00:14:56.660 --> 00:14:58.580
but it was away from the ballot box.

267
00:14:58.581 --> 00:15:03.170
That milk would first spread his political wings. That same year, 1973,

268
00:15:03.171 --> 00:15:07.580
the team's disunion was organizing a boycott of cause bear after the firm hard

269
00:15:08.240 --> 00:15:10.400
non-union labor milk approached them with a proposition.

270
00:15:10.580 --> 00:15:14.510
He would convince gay bars across San Francisco to stop stocking because in

271
00:15:14.511 --> 00:15:18.800
return, all the teams decided to do was agreed to hire gay drivers. By now,

272
00:15:18.801 --> 00:15:22.520
San Francisco is probably the gayest city in America with one estimate claiming

273
00:15:22.521 --> 00:15:25.430
nearly a fifth of the voting age population was LGBT.

274
00:15:25.550 --> 00:15:28.790
So when milk came good on its promise as quickly caved,

275
00:15:28.970 --> 00:15:31.430
it was milk's first major political victory,

276
00:15:31.490 --> 00:15:33.290
even though he had lost the election,

277
00:15:33.350 --> 00:15:37.970
it still proved that activists and macro blue collar unions could work

278
00:15:37.971 --> 00:15:41.900
together. This insight would become the basis for his future success.

279
00:15:42.260 --> 00:15:43.430
After the cause boycott milk,

280
00:15:43.460 --> 00:15:46.520
essentially it became a full-time activist in 1974,

281
00:15:46.521 --> 00:15:48.830
he created the Castro village association,

282
00:15:48.831 --> 00:15:53.030
the first organization in America to consist predominantly of LGBT owned

283
00:15:53.060 --> 00:15:57.140
businesses. As his president's milk started preaching a message of gay.

284
00:15:57.141 --> 00:16:01.910
Self-sufficiency telling other gay men to only shop in stores owned by people,

285
00:16:01.970 --> 00:16:04.430
or at least straight people who supported gay rights.

286
00:16:04.640 --> 00:16:08.570
His message made him notorious enough that he was able to run for supervisor

287
00:16:08.600 --> 00:16:13.010
again in 1975, but he was not notorious enough to win.

288
00:16:13.250 --> 00:16:15.290
Although Harvey managed to triple his vote,

289
00:16:15.291 --> 00:16:18.470
he still finished a damning seventh out of seven,

290
00:16:18.740 --> 00:16:22.790
but the campaign alone turned out to be enough that same year liberal style

291
00:16:23.030 --> 00:16:26.390
Wars. George Moscone was elected mayor of San Francisco.

292
00:16:26.630 --> 00:16:30.590
The former majority leader of the California Senate Moscone had been famously

293
00:16:30.591 --> 00:16:34.910
progressive advocating lower sentences for smoking pots and pushing to repeal

294
00:16:34.911 --> 00:16:37.850
California's sodomy laws as San Francisco's new mayor.

295
00:16:37.880 --> 00:16:41.420
He was determined to build an administration that actually resembled the city

296
00:16:41.600 --> 00:16:43.910
one in which minority voices would be heard.

297
00:16:44.180 --> 00:16:47.780
One of the voices was Harvey milk's in early 1976,

298
00:16:47.781 --> 00:16:51.800
mayor Moscone appointed milk to the board of permit appeals milk became the

299
00:16:51.801 --> 00:16:56.480
first openly gay city commissioner in America, a major statements from Moscone,

300
00:16:56.630 --> 00:17:00.380
but milk wasn't content to merely be appointed to his post.

301
00:17:00.500 --> 00:17:05.120
He wanted to show that people didn't need straight allies to get ahead that they

302
00:17:05.121 --> 00:17:08.720
were capable of winning elections themselves. So not long after that Moscone,

303
00:17:09.020 --> 00:17:12.470
heart and milk resigned with the intention of running for office. Again,

304
00:17:12.560 --> 00:17:14.300
this time he would finally win.

305
00:17:20.800 --> 00:17:21.220
<v 2>[Inaudible].</v>

306
00:17:21.220 --> 00:17:24.700
<v 0>Two years past in a blur of politics in 1976,</v>

307
00:17:24.701 --> 00:17:28.960
milk ran for the California state assembly only to see the pressure of running

308
00:17:28.961 --> 00:17:32.710
yet. Another political campaign destroying his relationship with Scott Smith.

309
00:17:32.770 --> 00:17:37.390
So milk changed tack and instead founded the San Francisco gay democratic

310
00:17:37.391 --> 00:17:37.870
club.

311
00:17:37.870 --> 00:17:41.260
The clubs successfully challenged the way the board of supervisors was elected

312
00:17:41.440 --> 00:17:44.440
resulting in bothered one, spin, citywide, voting,

313
00:17:44.560 --> 00:17:46.720
being ditched for votes by districts.

314
00:17:46.900 --> 00:17:51.060
And one of those new districts just happened to be centered around milks power

315
00:17:51.061 --> 00:17:52.830
base and Castro street.

316
00:17:52.950 --> 00:17:56.400
The outcome of this change was inevitable in 1977,

317
00:17:56.401 --> 00:17:59.520
a coalition of LGBT people and blue collar union workers,

318
00:18:00.150 --> 00:18:03.360
propels milk to victory in the latest board of supervisors election.

319
00:18:03.420 --> 00:18:06.210
It was a major progressive wave yet alongside milk.

320
00:18:06.300 --> 00:18:10.290
The city also elected its first Chinese American supervisor and first female

321
00:18:11.100 --> 00:18:14.850
African-American supervisor still. It was milk that the press focused on,

322
00:18:14.970 --> 00:18:17.970
although he wasn't the first out person to be elected to public office in the

323
00:18:17.971 --> 00:18:22.110
USA that honor went to Kathy Kazak Chenko in 1970,

324
00:18:22.760 --> 00:18:26.090
he was the first who seemed to be spearheading a movement milk.

325
00:18:26.090 --> 00:18:28.100
Wasn't just a politician who happened to be gay.

326
00:18:28.101 --> 00:18:32.450
He was a politician loudly declaring that he was gay and that gay rights would

327
00:18:32.451 --> 00:18:35.540
be part of his agenda at his swearing in ceremony. For example,

328
00:18:36.020 --> 00:18:38.570
milkmaid a speech condemning bans on gay marriage,

329
00:18:38.600 --> 00:18:42.050
but while he was great for the American LGBT community to see one of them

330
00:18:42.051 --> 00:18:43.850
members finally vocally standard,

331
00:18:44.450 --> 00:18:48.020
don't go thinking that everything was hunky Dory for America.

332
00:18:48.230 --> 00:18:49.130
At that same sentiment,

333
00:18:49.360 --> 00:18:53.600
another supervisor was sworn in whose views with a polar opposite of Harvey.

334
00:18:53.601 --> 00:18:57.680
Milk's Dan white was a Vietnam vet and former policemen who'd run for office

335
00:18:57.681 --> 00:19:01.550
because he felt the rising tide of social liberalism was drowning. His city.

336
00:19:01.610 --> 00:19:06.200
He felt that pot smokers and homos were turn San Francisco into a pink

337
00:19:06.260 --> 00:19:10.100
paradise and Harvey milk. He would find the homo. He hated yeah.

338
00:19:10.160 --> 00:19:11.780
More than any other, but down wide.

339
00:19:11.840 --> 00:19:15.560
It was likely the last thing on milk's mind in early 1978,

340
00:19:15.650 --> 00:19:18.080
by now he was receiving death threats almost daily,

341
00:19:18.081 --> 00:19:22.040
and I'd even recorded a tape marks in events of my assassination.

342
00:19:22.310 --> 00:19:25.850
His friends teased him about it. Austin, who do you think you are? Gay?

343
00:19:25.851 --> 00:19:27.500
Malcolm X, sadly.

344
00:19:27.830 --> 00:19:32.210
These joke comments would turn out to be painfully prescient from the get-go

345
00:19:32.630 --> 00:19:35.270
milk's role. As a supervisor was a baptism of fire.

346
00:19:35.300 --> 00:19:38.000
He had a groundbreaking initiatives, including fronting.

347
00:19:38.001 --> 00:19:42.920
What was then the strongest anti LGBT discrimination bill in us history.

348
00:19:43.130 --> 00:19:46.940
The only supervisor who refused to vote in favor of it was Dan white,

349
00:19:47.030 --> 00:19:49.610
but even as milk cheered, his first policy victory,

350
00:19:49.790 --> 00:19:54.160
a bigger battle was already brewing the year before the singer needs a brand

351
00:19:54.320 --> 00:19:57.740
that successfully fronted a campaign to appeal gay rights in Florida.

352
00:19:57.800 --> 00:20:01.610
This had sparked a wave of anti-gay legislation across the U S his newly

353
00:20:01.611 --> 00:20:04.520
acquired rights were suddenly snatched away.

354
00:20:04.700 --> 00:20:09.050
Now it was California's turn proposed in the state Senate by John Briggs

355
00:20:09.051 --> 00:20:13.400
proposition six was one of the ugliest bills of the Arab and attempts to not

356
00:20:13.401 --> 00:20:16.640
just make it mandatory to fire gay teachers, but to fire.

357
00:20:16.700 --> 00:20:21.320
Any teacher who held any non negative views about homosexuality,

358
00:20:21.680 --> 00:20:25.310
the scariest part was that voters seem to love it. In August.

359
00:20:25.490 --> 00:20:29.690
That year polls showed 61% of California's electorate supported prop six.

360
00:20:29.870 --> 00:20:32.600
It was a warning shot across the bow of the gay community. Yeah.

361
00:20:32.660 --> 00:20:34.340
Signal to not get all appetite,

362
00:20:34.370 --> 00:20:39.080
just because you got one elected in San Francisco. When milk heard of prop six,

363
00:20:39.380 --> 00:20:40.100
he was horrified.

364
00:20:40.100 --> 00:20:43.970
It seems like even the sunshine stage was desperate to turn back the clock to

365
00:20:43.971 --> 00:20:45.530
the misery of the 1930s.

366
00:20:45.800 --> 00:20:50.470
So he vows to do what he did best Harvey milk was going to fight fire

367
00:20:50.860 --> 00:20:51.693
with fire.

368
00:20:56.670 --> 00:20:57.503
<v 2>Okay.</v>

369
00:20:58.380 --> 00:20:59.101
<v 0>In the film milk,</v>

370
00:20:59.101 --> 00:21:02.040
one pump that probably stuck with you is the scene where Harvey milk takes

371
00:21:02.041 --> 00:21:06.330
apart. The utterly moronic myth that gay role models can corrupt children.

372
00:21:06.600 --> 00:21:08.760
Well, that was a real speech.

373
00:21:08.761 --> 00:21:12.690
One milk really made during a public debate and it bears repeating here.

374
00:21:12.840 --> 00:21:16.320
I was born of heterosexual parents. I was taught by heterosexual,

375
00:21:16.321 --> 00:21:20.940
teaches in a fiercely heterosexual society, television ads and newspaper ads,

376
00:21:20.970 --> 00:21:25.680
fiercely heterosexual, a society that puts down homosexuality.

377
00:21:25.890 --> 00:21:29.730
And why am I a homosexual? If I'm affected by role models,

378
00:21:29.850 --> 00:21:32.310
I should have been a heterosexual.

379
00:21:32.730 --> 00:21:36.960
This simple logical demolition of his opponent's arguments is where we can see

380
00:21:36.961 --> 00:21:41.730
the genius of Harvey milk. Sure. He was bombastic and often angry. Sure.

381
00:21:41.731 --> 00:21:45.660
This anger damaged his home life, ruining several of his relationships,

382
00:21:46.020 --> 00:21:49.620
but it also meant that when America needed someone to be angry,

383
00:21:49.810 --> 00:21:53.730
needed someone who would stand up and fight Harvey milk was ready.

384
00:21:54.210 --> 00:21:58.500
That Selma unfold milk ran his hottest campaign ever against prop six.

385
00:21:58.650 --> 00:22:00.870
He did it with a mix of humor, like when he told her rally,

386
00:22:00.871 --> 00:22:01.920
my name is Harvey milk,

387
00:22:01.921 --> 00:22:06.240
and I'm here to recruit you and impressive political showmanship takes the come

388
00:22:06.241 --> 00:22:08.550
out, come out campaign in fiery speeches,

389
00:22:08.551 --> 00:22:13.200
milk declared the closet was a conspiracy of silence. And that gay people,

390
00:22:13.230 --> 00:22:17.190
we will not win our rights spice stand quietly in our closets.

391
00:22:17.250 --> 00:22:19.620
He told LGBT people, they must come out.

392
00:22:19.770 --> 00:22:23.460
They must show their faces and their family that they existed,

393
00:22:23.640 --> 00:22:27.030
that only they and they alone could dispel the ignorance surrounding their

394
00:22:27.031 --> 00:22:30.510
lives. It was one of the best fought campaigns in California in history.

395
00:22:30.600 --> 00:22:31.351
In real time,

396
00:22:31.351 --> 00:22:35.790
you could watch the polls slide from 61% for prop six in August to

397
00:22:35.791 --> 00:22:39.300
58% against by October, although milk.

398
00:22:39.301 --> 00:22:41.760
Wasn't the only one campaigning against prop six.

399
00:22:41.910 --> 00:22:46.290
It was his efforts more than any others that ensured it went crashing down in

400
00:22:46.291 --> 00:22:48.720
flames. On November the seventh, 1978,

401
00:22:48.750 --> 00:22:52.080
prop six was utterly defeated on the back of this success.

402
00:22:52.320 --> 00:22:56.790
Milk began telling everyone that this was only the beginning that his next move

403
00:22:56.910 --> 00:22:59.490
would be to run for mayor. But sadly,

404
00:22:59.970 --> 00:23:01.920
it never got as chomps by November.

405
00:23:01.950 --> 00:23:06.330
Dan white had become so disgusted with the liberalism of city hall and the low

406
00:23:06.331 --> 00:23:08.790
pay of his supervisor job that he quit in disgust.

407
00:23:08.880 --> 00:23:12.720
But his old police buddies told him not to be done to keep standing up the

408
00:23:12.721 --> 00:23:16.770
family values and law and order. So whites have tried to get his job back.

409
00:23:16.771 --> 00:23:18.870
And man Moscone had refused.

410
00:23:18.930 --> 00:23:22.380
He and milk was certain that's a special election would return someone more

411
00:23:22.381 --> 00:23:26.370
liberal to the seat. And then they'd never have to worry about Dan white again,

412
00:23:26.670 --> 00:23:31.050
but worry is exactly what they should've done on November the 28th white

413
00:23:31.410 --> 00:23:33.300
returned to city hall with a revolver in his pocket.

414
00:23:33.570 --> 00:23:37.230
He avoided the metal detectors by climbing through an open window and then went

415
00:23:37.231 --> 00:23:41.430
to Moscow in his office and shot him four times that done white reloaded.

416
00:23:41.431 --> 00:23:45.890
His revolver walked down the hall to Harvey milk's office and put bullets in

417
00:23:46.040 --> 00:23:46.280
him.

418
00:23:46.280 --> 00:23:50.630
The reaction to Harvey milk's assassination showed both the best and the worst

419
00:23:50.631 --> 00:23:54.440
of America at the truly awful end. There was the trial of Dan Weitz,

420
00:23:54.441 --> 00:23:57.710
which ended in a heterosexual jury, convicting him not of murder,

421
00:23:58.010 --> 00:24:01.220
but of manslaughter in sentencing him to a mere six years.

422
00:24:01.940 --> 00:24:05.720
Whites insultingly dumb defense was that eating too much junk food had made him

423
00:24:05.721 --> 00:24:09.020
temporarily insane in the wake of whites, pitiful sentence,

424
00:24:09.021 --> 00:24:13.280
San Francisco was paralyzed by what became known as the white night riots.

425
00:24:13.310 --> 00:24:16.100
When protestors gathered cops attack them with nightsticks,

426
00:24:16.101 --> 00:24:20.300
sparking a rod that saw city hall partially burned down in retaliation.

427
00:24:20.301 --> 00:24:24.170
A group of rogue cops, drive-ins Castro street and van Lee beat anyone.

428
00:24:24.170 --> 00:24:25.970
They found shouting Andy gay slurs,

429
00:24:25.971 --> 00:24:30.230
as they did say it was one of the lowest moments in San Francisco's history,

430
00:24:30.350 --> 00:24:34.660
cops physically attacking innocent people for the crime of well,

431
00:24:34.661 --> 00:24:37.130
what an illegal level of fabulousness.

432
00:24:37.340 --> 00:24:40.430
But while the white night riots were a stain on California,

433
00:24:40.610 --> 00:24:43.040
what came next was far more inspiring.

434
00:24:43.190 --> 00:24:46.280
The assassination and its aftermath galvanized the gay community.

435
00:24:46.460 --> 00:24:50.330
It was from these ashes that gay activism of the eighties and nineties was born.

436
00:24:50.630 --> 00:24:52.250
And while there would be many,

437
00:24:52.280 --> 00:24:56.840
many more setbacks and marked the moments that the tide finally began to turn

438
00:24:56.960 --> 00:24:59.720
today, gay rights in America have progressed to be on Harvey.

439
00:24:59.721 --> 00:25:00.890
Milk's wildest dreams.

440
00:25:01.130 --> 00:25:05.300
Since 2015 gay marriage has been legal in all 50 States.

441
00:25:05.450 --> 00:25:09.800
There are openly gay lesbian and bisexual people serving in Congress right now,

442
00:25:10.100 --> 00:25:11.390
albeit only nine of them.

443
00:25:11.600 --> 00:25:15.740
Obviously this can't all be laid at the feet of Harvey. Milky was just one man,

444
00:25:15.741 --> 00:25:20.720
one man in a relatively low position in one city who sat in office for less than

445
00:25:20.721 --> 00:25:21.554
a single year.

446
00:25:21.560 --> 00:25:25.070
And yet there's no doubting that he made a difference for millions and millions

447
00:25:25.071 --> 00:25:28.370
of LGBT people. Harvey milk was the man who showed them the way,

448
00:25:28.490 --> 00:25:30.470
the one who showed them what was possible,

449
00:25:30.560 --> 00:25:34.730
what could be achieved if risks were taken as the boy from long islands,

450
00:25:34.731 --> 00:25:37.300
once prophetically said the death threats against him,

451
00:25:37.660 --> 00:25:40.030
if a bullet should enter my brain less than that,

452
00:25:40.060 --> 00:25:44.890
bullet destroy every closet door by living the life he led by

453
00:25:44.891 --> 00:25:46.990
being defiantly out and proud.

454
00:25:47.230 --> 00:25:52.030
Harvey milk helped destroy more closet doors than any number of bullets ever

455
00:25:52.031 --> 00:25:55.030
could. So I really hope you enjoyed that video. If you did,
