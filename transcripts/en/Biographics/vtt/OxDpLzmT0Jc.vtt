9
00:00:26.480 --> 00:00:28.160
you likely think of his themes.

Louis is said to have pushed forward the bounds of mechanical aviation and his

12
00:00:36.261 --> 00:00:40.700
expertise was a vital importance to the American military in the Pacific during

13
00:00:40.701 --> 00:00:43.610
world war two, lauded by many as an international hero,

14
00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:47.840
Lindbergh's carefully controlled public persona certainly presented him as such,

15
00:00:47.870 --> 00:00:51.500
but there was a shady secretive underbelly to this larger than life figure,

16
00:00:51.501 --> 00:00:54.650
which in the few moments that exposed itself during his life,

17
00:00:54.980 --> 00:00:56.720
it caused him international controversy.

18
00:00:56.840 --> 00:01:00.290
The man born Charles or Augustus Lindbergh was a pioneer of early aviation,

19
00:01:00.320 --> 00:01:01.490
an author, an activist,

20
00:01:01.491 --> 00:01:04.940
and to key consultant and combatants for American forces during the height of

21
00:01:04.941 --> 00:01:09.650
world war II. What many often overlook as Lindbergh would have wanted where his

22
00:01:09.651 --> 00:01:12.170
isolationists, eugenesis ideals,

00:01:12.380 --> 00:01:15.050
the mystery kidnapping and death of his infant son,

24
00:01:15.370 --> 00:01:16.910
and as the eight illegitimate children,

25
00:01:16.911 --> 00:01:20.330
he fathered with multiple women in Germany to quote the youngest of these

26
00:01:20.331 --> 00:01:21.830
children after Lindbergh's death.

27
00:01:21.890 --> 00:01:26.600
This story reflects absolutely Byzantine layers of deception on the part of our

28
00:01:26.601 --> 00:01:29.900
shared father. These children did not even know who he was.

29
00:01:29.990 --> 00:01:33.890
He used a pseudonym with them to protect them perhaps to protect himself.

30
00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:37.940
Absolutely even whilst on his deathbed Lindbergh wrote letters across the

31
00:01:37.941 --> 00:01:38.360
Atlantic,

32
00:01:38.360 --> 00:01:42.410
urging his mistresses to keep quiet as elicit activities to coding facts from

33
00:01:42.411 --> 00:01:47.300
fiction is a tightrope walk when examining such a full life yet even the simple

34
00:01:47.420 --> 00:01:51.980
facts, more than surprising in regards to this Titan of 20th century.

who would go on to be a us Congressman throughout most of Charles's youth,

39
00:02:11.270 --> 00:02:13.580
representing Minnesota in the house of representatives.

40
00:02:13.581 --> 00:02:17.570
The elder Charles was one of very few congressmen do oppose us entry into world

but more on that to come with his parents divorcing when he was seven,

46
00:02:32.181 --> 00:02:34.220
Charles moved around often during childhood,

47
00:02:34.221 --> 00:02:38.000
never attending any school for more than two years after graduating high school,

48
00:02:38.450 --> 00:02:41.390
Lindbergh began attending engineering school at the university of Wisconsin,

49
00:02:41.391 --> 00:02:44.780
Madison, but he dropped out during his sophomore year and moved to Lincoln,

50
00:02:44.781 --> 00:02:47.990
Nebraska to pursue flight training in the spring of his 20th year,

51
00:02:48.080 --> 00:02:51.800
Charles has an innate interest in mechanical engineering and zap liens in

particular as he reached adolescence,

53
00:02:53.500 --> 00:02:58.160
but never had he been exposed to aviation until enrolling in the Nebraska

54
00:02:58.190 --> 00:03:00.520
aircraft corporation's school in Lincoln,

55
00:03:00.790 --> 00:03:04.450
gaining his first flight experience there as a passenger and copilot Limburg

soon left the school to and money in order to learn to fly solo,

57
00:03:08.260 --> 00:03:09.460
to earn the cash sheet needed.

58
00:03:09.910 --> 00:03:13.300
Lindbergh worked as a barnstormer performing death-defying aerial stunts,

59
00:03:13.301 --> 00:03:15.190
such as wingwalking on planes.

after showing off his aerial stunts across the Southern us for the next few

00:03:35.711 --> 00:03:39.310
Daredevil Charles decided it was time to commit fully to piloting somebody

00:03:39.820 --> 00:03:42.790
enrolled in the year-long flight training program offered by the United States

70
00:03:42.791 --> 00:03:44.530
army air service in San Antonio,

71
00:03:44.531 --> 00:03:48.850
Texas early aviation was anything but safe and only 18 of the

72
00:03:48.851 --> 00:03:52.480
104 who enrolled in the program finished it a year later,

73
00:03:52.600 --> 00:03:55.780
Charles was among them despite suffering a mid-air collision with another cadet

74
00:03:55.840 --> 00:03:59.230
during aerial combat maneuver drills just eight days before he was due to

75
00:03:59.231 --> 00:04:03.370
graduate Linberg was able to attract and parachute out in time. And fortunately,

76
00:04:03.520 --> 00:04:07.030
this would be the most serious accident Charles would have through the rest of

77
00:04:07.031 --> 00:04:09.580
his aviation career, graduating top of his class,

78
00:04:09.670 --> 00:04:12.910
and in Bergen's a commission as a second Lieutenant in the air reserve service

court upon completion of his training,

80
00:04:14.981 --> 00:04:18.220
and then learning that additional active duty pilots were not needed.

81
00:04:18.310 --> 00:04:21.940
Charles returned as a civilian piloting as a barnstormer and flunked instructor

82
00:04:21.970 --> 00:04:25.600
by participating in a limited fashion in military flights in his spare time,

83
00:04:25.601 --> 00:04:29.950
Lindbergh was twice promoted to Lieutenant and then to captain by 1926,

84
00:04:30.130 --> 00:04:32.740
during this formative period in the mugs life,

85
00:04:32.741 --> 00:04:37.180

00:04:47.341 --> 00:04:51.660
Raymond I'd heard about the first successful nonstop transatlantic crossing in

90
00:04:51.661 --> 00:04:54.810
1919, which was completed by a duo of British pilots.

91
00:04:54.840 --> 00:04:57.690
The flight was 1,900 miles and impressive feat,

92
00:04:57.720 --> 00:05:02.610
but only about 60% of the distance between New York and Paris inspired by this

00:05:02.611 --> 00:05:06.390
achievements and wishing for more efficient transport between the two world

nonstop between New York and Paris.

96
00:05:13.410 --> 00:05:17.460
The prize had a five-year time limits and when no one completed the seemingly

97
00:05:17.461 --> 00:05:21.330
impossible feat within the allotted time or to renewed the prize for another

98
00:05:21.331 --> 00:05:24.510
half decade, by the time Auti renewed the prize in 1924,

99
00:05:24.511 --> 00:05:28.290
a number of well-funded and famous world war one pilots of several nations were

100
00:05:28.500 --> 00:05:30.330
attempting this monumental task.

101
00:05:30.420 --> 00:05:33.810
ACEs from Europe and America alike gave it their best effort,

102
00:05:33.840 --> 00:05:38.790
but they all ended in catastrophe and death exemplifying the perilous nature

103
00:05:38.791 --> 00:05:41.730
of undertaking this fetal competition, Charles Lindbergh,

104
00:05:41.760 --> 00:05:45.540
a relatively inexperienced and anonymous ABA drew at the time caught wind of the

105
00:05:45.541 --> 00:05:49.380
prize referred to as the Orteig prize Lindbergh decided to enter the race.

106
00:05:49.410 --> 00:05:50.820
Despite the stiff competition,

107
00:05:50.910 --> 00:05:53.250
Lindbergh found it difficult to secure funding for his gold,

108
00:05:53.251 --> 00:05:57.290
but while working on his ML route between St Louis and Chicago in 1926,

109
00:05:57.410 --> 00:06:00.440
he convinced to St. Louis businessmen to fund his endeavor.

110
00:06:00.530 --> 00:06:04.760
Charles felt confident he could win the Orteig prize due to his experience in

111
00:06:04.761 --> 00:06:06.260
both mechanics and piloting,

112
00:06:06.410 --> 00:06:09.890
just like having substantially less financial support than his competitors.

113
00:06:10.100 --> 00:06:13.310
San Diego based rod aircraft company agreed to build the plane.

114
00:06:13.311 --> 00:06:16.280
And it was to be named the spirit of St. Louis in honor,

115
00:06:16.281 --> 00:06:18.710
of the finance seers upon Charles insistence.

116
00:06:18.711 --> 00:06:21.320
They agreed to allow him to co-design the plane as well.

117
00:06:21.380 --> 00:06:24.080
The main engineering difference between the spirits of some Louis and its

118
00:06:24.081 --> 00:06:28.820
competitors was it's designed with launch a fuel tanks and no second seat for a

119
00:06:28.821 --> 00:06:29.570
navigator,

120
00:06:29.570 --> 00:06:33.050
a two man team of pilot navigate and made all other attempts at transatlantic

121
00:06:33.051 --> 00:06:36.950
crossings. But Lindenberg reassured the uneasy Ryan aircraft company.

122
00:06:37.610 --> 00:06:41.600
He could handle both jobs by himself by removing the space for the second seat

123
00:06:41.601 --> 00:06:45.380
and replacing it with an extra fuel tank. The spirits of St. Louis was lighter.

124
00:06:45.650 --> 00:06:48.770
Runs had more range than its competitors. Early in 1927,

125
00:06:48.771 --> 00:06:51.410
the aircraft was complete. And after some flight tests,

126
00:06:51.411 --> 00:06:55.910
including a trip from San Diego to New York Lindbergh's team deems the spirit of

127
00:06:56.090 --> 00:07:00.110
St. Louis ready to attempt the transatlantic crossing in may of 1927.

attempting to capture the Orteig prize,

131
00:07:09.440 --> 00:07:13.700
the loss and presumed death that Francis most decorated and famous pilot to date

132
00:07:14.240 --> 00:07:16.580
cost further doubt over the less funded sins,

133
00:07:16.730 --> 00:07:20.330
less established Lindbergh attempt on may the 20th, 1927.

134
00:07:20.331 --> 00:07:23.810
The spirits of some Lewis with Charles at the helm took off from Roosevelt

135
00:07:24.380 --> 00:07:27.230
airfields in New York, spanning the ensuing 33 and a half hours,

136
00:07:27.231 --> 00:07:29.000
a completely alone Lindsburg overcame,

137
00:07:29.360 --> 00:07:32.780
icy and blind flying conditions flew above a storm at 10,000 feet.

138
00:07:32.780 --> 00:07:36.740
And as low as 10 feet over wave tops do avoid the harsh weather of the North

139
00:07:36.741 --> 00:07:40.490
Atlantic because navigation techniques were unreliable and primitive by today's

140
00:07:40.491 --> 00:07:43.190
standards. And Lindbergh had no communication with anyone.

141
00:07:43.280 --> 00:07:46.970
He relied solely on dead reckoning to estimate his position during the flight,

142
00:07:47.000 --> 00:07:48.920
by sheer luck, the winds over the Atlantic,

143
00:07:48.921 --> 00:07:50.750
essentially nullified one another that day,

144
00:07:50.751 --> 00:07:54.860
negating any potential wind drift and miraculously keeping Charles on course

145
00:07:55.100 --> 00:07:58.730
around 33 hours after departing Roosevelt, airfields are freezing,

146
00:07:58.760 --> 00:08:00.080
exhausted and hungry.

147
00:08:00.081 --> 00:08:04.610
Linberg spotted his intended target of [inaudible] airfield outside of Paris,

148
00:08:04.670 --> 00:08:05.570
unbeknownst to Charles,

149
00:08:05.571 --> 00:08:09.350
a crowd of approximately 150,000 Brazilians flocked to the airfield to see

150
00:08:09.860 --> 00:08:09.861
lands.

151
00:08:09.861 --> 00:08:14.090
And the headlights from their cars acted as a beacon for Lundbeck safe landing.

152
00:08:14.270 --> 00:08:16.850
As soon as he touched down in Paris on the evening of may,

153
00:08:16.851 --> 00:08:21.800
the 21st Charles Lindbergh had gone from virtual anonymity to a worldwide

154
00:08:21.830 --> 00:08:24.680
aviation hero of unprecedented scale.

shortly after the heroic flight to New York city hosted a ticker-tape parade.

159
00:08:37.931 --> 00:08:41.590
And then a ceremony for Lindbergh who was seen in person by some 4 million

160
00:08:41.591 --> 00:08:44.800
people that day, the French foreign office flew the American flag in them,

162
00:08:48.161 --> 00:08:50.440
Up until that point and December, 1927,

163
00:08:50.830 --> 00:08:53.860
Lindbergh was awarded the congressional medal of honor by president Calvin

164
00:08:53.861 --> 00:08:57.960
Coolidge and especially sign of respect due to the fact that it was the highest

167
00:09:04.890 --> 00:09:09.090
These are just a few of the many awards that Limburg received representation of

168
00:09:09.091 --> 00:09:13.110
just how much recognition and adulation he received for enhancing the

169
00:09:13.111 --> 00:09:17.190
possibilities of aviation using his newfound fame and subsequent fortune from

170
00:09:17.280 --> 00:09:19.410
speaking doors and pending an autobiography.

171
00:09:19.440 --> 00:09:22.590
Charles shifted his focus towards scientific exploration,

172
00:09:23.010 --> 00:09:26.310
Lemberg designed a wristwatch that when used concurrently with the sextons and

173
00:09:26.311 --> 00:09:30.330
nautical Almanac allowed fellow aviators to determine their exact longer toot

174
00:09:30.720 --> 00:09:33.060
jaws presented as designed to the laundry you wash company.

175
00:09:33.061 --> 00:09:35.370
And they began production in 1931,

176
00:09:35.560 --> 00:09:39.660
the same laundry navigation watches are produced to this day with GPS navigation

177
00:09:39.661 --> 00:09:43.800
only recently making them obsolete as a result of his sister-in-law developing a

178
00:09:43.830 --> 00:09:44.850
fatal heart condition.

179
00:09:44.970 --> 00:09:48.300
Lindbergh became curious about the possibility of performing surgery on the

180
00:09:48.301 --> 00:09:51.120
heart. Those such procedures did not exist at the time.

181
00:09:51.300 --> 00:09:55.650
Charles studied outside of body perfusion procedures with Nobel prize winner,

182
00:09:56.760 --> 00:09:56.940
Alexis Carroll,

183
00:09:56.940 --> 00:10:00.580
the unlikely duo found the results of best study encouraging and thus developed

184
00:10:00.750 --> 00:10:03.240
the glass perfusion pump, which Charles nicknames,

185
00:10:03.241 --> 00:10:07.830
the model T pump and homage to his friend Henry fought this glass perfusion pump

186
00:10:07.831 --> 00:10:10.560
led to the creation of the first ever heart-lung machine.

187
00:10:10.560 --> 00:10:14.340
And it is also wanting to be credited in making future heart surgeries possible.

188
00:10:14.430 --> 00:10:17.350
Considering his lack of expertise in the medical field and the impact of the

189
00:10:17.550 --> 00:10:19.230
model T pump had on medical advancements.

190
00:10:19.410 --> 00:10:23.490
This feat of engineering was perhaps as impressive as Charles as transatlantic

191
00:10:23.491 --> 00:10:27.570
crossing five years prior. And if you're looking to do something impressive,

192
00:10:27.660 --> 00:10:30.720
well, let me tell you about a great way to get that out to the world.

193
00:10:30.840 --> 00:10:33.420
That's where the website with today's sponsor Squarespace. Now,

194
00:10:33.421 --> 00:10:37.140
maybe you've got an idea for a website or a business or a podcast or something

195
00:10:37.141 --> 00:10:39.210
knocking around in your mind. And you're like, well,

196
00:10:39.780 --> 00:10:42.030
I'm thinking about doing that. Should I do it? Well?

197
00:10:42.210 --> 00:10:44.820
The second thing is that the only way to figure out if it's a good idea,

198
00:10:44.940 --> 00:10:47.460
and if people want to listen to you to buy your product,

199
00:10:47.490 --> 00:10:50.550
whatever is to make a website and get it out there into the world.

200
00:10:50.550 --> 00:10:53.550
And that can be daunting because it's scary to go and pursue new things,

201
00:10:53.551 --> 00:10:56.610
but not knowing how to set up a website is not an excuse.

202
00:10:56.611 --> 00:10:59.070

220
00:11:54.660 --> 00:11:57.510
<v 0>Charles Lindbergh was internationally celebrated as a hero.</v>

221
00:11:57.540 --> 00:12:01.050
He did not enjoy all the attention that came with his stardom in order to escape

222
00:12:01.051 --> 00:12:04.860
the masses and settle down into family life Lindbergh purchased in the state in

223
00:12:04.861 --> 00:12:05.970
Hopewell New Jersey.

224
00:12:06.060 --> 00:12:09.810
It was here that he intended to raise his first child Charles Lindbergh Jr.

225
00:12:09.811 --> 00:12:13.230
With his wife and Mara Lindbergh. However, on the fateful night of March,

226
00:12:13.231 --> 00:12:16.560
the first 1930 to 20 month old Charles InBev Jr.

227
00:12:16.590 --> 00:12:19.140
Was abducted from his crib at the family estate in Hopewell,

228
00:12:19.170 --> 00:12:23.220
the anonymous kidnapping note demanded a $50,000 ransom equivalents to over

229
00:12:23.221 --> 00:12:26.730
$900,000 in 2020, and hoping to catch the kidnapper.

230
00:12:26.731 --> 00:12:30.240
The ransom was paid with bills with recorded serial numbers and gold

231
00:12:30.780 --> 00:12:32.400
certificates. Soon to be removed from circulation,

232
00:12:32.580 --> 00:12:35.520
both of which would attract attention if used by the abductor,

233
00:12:35.610 --> 00:12:37.800
commonly regarded as the crime of the century,

234
00:12:37.980 --> 00:12:41.370
media outlets worldwide picked up on the story details of the case became

235
00:12:41.371 --> 00:12:42.240
increasingly public.

236
00:12:42.240 --> 00:12:45.810
As time went on and local and federal police generated thousands of leads for

237
00:12:45.811 --> 00:12:49.950
suspects all across the country. 70 days after Charles Lindbergh Jr disappeared,

238
00:12:49.951 --> 00:12:53.580
his decomposed remains were found in the woods less than five miles from the

239
00:12:53.581 --> 00:12:55.830
family estate. The case was far from over.

240
00:12:55.831 --> 00:12:59.520
How are those J Edgar Hoover head of the Bureau of investigations worked closely

241
00:12:59.521 --> 00:13:02.880
with the New Jersey state police to hunt down the murderer for two and a half

242
00:13:02.881 --> 00:13:06.150
years, no suspect was identified as the culprits, but finally,

243
00:13:06.151 --> 00:13:07.170
the gold reserve notes,

244
00:13:07.980 --> 00:13:11.470
recirculated and law enforcements linked to the notes to Bruno Richard Hauptmann

245
00:13:11.670 --> 00:13:15.210
carpenter who immigrated from Germany 11 years prop helped him in his

246
00:13:15.220 --> 00:13:18.930
handwriting sample matched the ransom note and more of the rents and money was

247
00:13:18.960 --> 00:13:21.780
traced back to him. He was charged with first degree murder,

248
00:13:21.840 --> 00:13:25.110
tried convicted and sentenced to death in 1936.

249
00:13:25.410 --> 00:13:27.850
Bruno Hoffman was no more having faced these same,

250
00:13:27.960 --> 00:13:31.680
that fatal consequences that he imposed on Charles Lindbergh Jr.

251
00:13:32.100 --> 00:13:35.160
The only silver lining of this heinous crime was that Congress enacted the

252
00:13:35.161 --> 00:13:37.650
Lindbergh law in response to the atrocity.

253
00:13:37.740 --> 00:13:39.480
You making kidnapping a federal offense.

254
00:13:39.481 --> 00:13:41.640
If the victim is transported across state lines,

255
00:13:41.670 --> 00:13:44.850
or if the male law interstate commerce is used to elicit a ransom.

<v 1>[Inaudible].</v>

257

<v 0>Charles Lindbergh was an intensely private man despite his worldwide celebrity</v>

259
00:13:57.361 --> 00:13:59.580
that caused fear for the safety of his three-year-old son,

260
00:14:00.180 --> 00:14:04.170
Limburg decided to quietly leave the United States for England in December,

261
00:14:04.170 --> 00:14:07.830
1935, the Lindbergh family boarded a United States freighter is the only three

262
00:14:07.831 --> 00:14:09.990
passengers headed for Liverpool for three years.

263
00:14:09.991 --> 00:14:12.450
The family lived in a rented home in Liverpool before, again,

264
00:14:12.451 --> 00:14:15.420
relocating to the Breton coast of France in 1938.

265
00:14:15.690 --> 00:14:19.170
It was during these years that Lindbergh's controversial political views began

266
00:14:19.171 --> 00:14:23.880
to emerge between 1936 and 1938 in the years leading up to world war II.

267
00:14:24.030 --> 00:14:27.900
The us military sent Charles and Berg Germany to evaluate German aviation.

268
00:14:27.901 --> 00:14:32.310
Several times by 1938 Lindbergh was friendly with top-ranking Nazi party

269
00:14:32.311 --> 00:14:35.190
officials like Herman Gehring Geminis at chief,

270
00:14:35.340 --> 00:14:38.790
and one of Hitler's top advisors that same year Gehring presented Lindbergh was

271
00:14:38.791 --> 00:14:43.320
the commander cross of the order of the German Eagle and Charles gladly accepted

272
00:14:43.321 --> 00:14:46.800
this prestigious owner accepting the award proved controversial due to the

273
00:14:46.801 --> 00:14:48.450
infamous Kristallnacht pogrom.

274
00:14:48.630 --> 00:14:52.550
Essentially kick-starting the Holocaust just weeks up when writing in his

275
00:14:52.551 --> 00:14:56.660
private diary, Lindbergh admitted that Germany had a serious Jewish problem,

276
00:14:56.870 --> 00:15:00.400
but he did not understand why they would attack Jewish businesses and homes.

277
00:15:00.401 --> 00:15:02.270
So aggressively and only in 1939,

278
00:15:02.271 --> 00:15:06.110
us general HH Arnold requested that Charles returned to the United States to

279
00:15:06.260 --> 00:15:10.460
evaluate the American army Accor readiness for war should such measures become

280
00:15:10.461 --> 00:15:13.760
necessary. Although we have made the orders of general Arnold Lindenberg,

281
00:15:13.820 --> 00:15:18.350
starkly opposed us intervention and what he deemed a European conflict in

282
00:15:18.351 --> 00:15:19.370
August, 1939,

283
00:15:19.371 --> 00:15:22.820
Albert Einstein selected Lindbergh as the pilot needed to deliver an essential

284
00:15:22.821 --> 00:15:24.290
message to president Roosevelt,

285
00:15:24.440 --> 00:15:27.860
warning him about the destructive potential of nuclear efficient Lindbergh

286
00:15:27.890 --> 00:15:30.410
ignored Einstein's request. And days later,

287
00:15:30.440 --> 00:15:33.740
he delivered a radio address condemning us intervention in the war.

288
00:15:34.220 --> 00:15:38.360
Linberg also sympathized with the German plight as well as implying antisemitic

289
00:15:38.361 --> 00:15:42.110
conspiratorial views about Jews controlling public perception of the war.

290
00:15:42.200 --> 00:15:43.033
Two months later,

291
00:15:43.340 --> 00:15:45.890
Lindbergh criticized Canada for supporting Britain in the fight against the

292
00:15:45.891 --> 00:15:50.300
Nazis and dragging the Western hemisphere into the so-called European war.

293
00:15:50.540 --> 00:15:53.660
By the ends of the following year Linberg was the spokesman for the America

294
00:15:53.661 --> 00:15:54.261
first committee,

295
00:15:54.261 --> 00:15:57.770
a political action group focused on non-intervention in world war II.

296
00:15:57.800 --> 00:16:01.460
He delivered speeches to packed arenas across the United States with a message

297
00:16:01.461 --> 00:16:06.320
that three groups were to blame for pressing this country into war, the British,

298
00:16:06.470 --> 00:16:10.520
the Jews and the Roosevelt administration in response to this heavy criticism,

299
00:16:10.521 --> 00:16:14.840
president Roosevelt denounced Lindbergh's attitude toward war is cowardly and

300
00:16:15.020 --> 00:16:18.890
appeasing the Nazis as well as questioning his loyalty to the American flag in

301
00:16:18.891 --> 00:16:20.960
the face of such public criticism from the president,

302
00:16:21.380 --> 00:16:24.020
Lindbergh felt he had no choice, but to step down from his military posts.

303
00:16:24.140 --> 00:16:26.060
In addition to opposing the war against Germany,

304
00:16:26.480 --> 00:16:29.630
Lindbergh also had strong naughty assistant eugenesis ideals,

305
00:16:29.631 --> 00:16:33.980
and he spoke openly about how he felt certain races were superior to others.

306
00:16:34.100 --> 00:16:35.840
In one particularly alarming quote,

307
00:16:35.990 --> 00:16:39.830
Charles stated that racial strengths is vital politics,

308
00:16:40.220 --> 00:16:42.380
a luxury furthermore, Henry Ford,

309
00:16:42.440 --> 00:16:46.040
to the automobile tycoon and publisher of an antisemitic newspaper famously

310
00:16:46.041 --> 00:16:47.930
stated when Charles comes out here,

311
00:16:48.140 --> 00:16:52.460
we only talk about the Jews while these racist viewpoints are deplorable to

312
00:16:52.461 --> 00:16:53.360
modern society.

313
00:16:53.361 --> 00:16:57.530
The unfortunate reality of the day was that Lindbergh's mindsets about the

314
00:16:57.531 --> 00:17:02.120
existence of a racial hierarchy with Nordic races at the top was not

315
00:17:02.121 --> 00:17:05.330
uncommon and enjoyed social acceptance by many others.

316
00:17:12.040 --> 00:17:12.130
<v 3>[Inaudible].</v>

317
00:17:12.130 --> 00:17:14.470
<v 0>The attack on Pearl Harbor in December, 1941,</v>

318
00:17:14.471 --> 00:17:16.210
left the United States with no choice,

319
00:17:16.211 --> 00:17:19.840
but to enter world war II Lindbergh's ever-growing non-interventionist movement

320
00:17:19.841 --> 00:17:20.710
was derailed.

321
00:17:20.740 --> 00:17:23.980
The moment Japanese bombs landed on that December morning in Hawaii,

322
00:17:24.220 --> 00:17:27.370
despite his leaving military service Lindbergh still wished to show his

323
00:17:27.371 --> 00:17:30.160
patriotism and support for the military during combat.

324
00:17:30.340 --> 00:17:34.120
So we offered his services as a consultant between 1942 and 1944,

325
00:17:34.240 --> 00:17:35.200
Lindbergh operated,

326
00:17:35.201 --> 00:17:39.430
stateside ironing out kinks in the production line for forwards B 24 liberate a

327
00:17:39.431 --> 00:17:40.264
fighter plane,

328
00:17:40.270 --> 00:17:44.110
and then the United aircraft as an engineering consultants by 1944,

329
00:17:44.560 --> 00:17:47.260
Charles was itching to prove his worth in a true combat environment.

330
00:17:47.470 --> 00:17:50.850
And he persuaded United States to send him to the Pacific theater,

331
00:17:50.970 --> 00:17:54.660
to examine aircraft performance in combat conditions immediately showing his

332
00:17:54.661 --> 00:17:57.600
aviation knowledge was an assets Jones taught combat pilots.

333
00:17:57.601 --> 00:18:00.540
How to safely take off with a double payload of bombs.

334
00:18:00.960 --> 00:18:04.740
Limburg also demonstrated the safest technique for leaning fuel to increase the

335
00:18:04.741 --> 00:18:08.430
range fighters could fly on one gas tank vessel allowing for more long distance,

336
00:18:08.730 --> 00:18:10.020
Boeing raids against the Japanese.

337
00:18:10.230 --> 00:18:14.130
These innovations were vital in American success in recovering the Pacific and

338
00:18:14.580 --> 00:18:18.330
Linberg was tasked with teaching them to countless American fighter pilots and

339
00:18:18.510 --> 00:18:21.540
both flew his first combat mission within months of arriving in the Pacific,

340
00:18:21.570 --> 00:18:23.910
despite holding no official rank or title.

341
00:18:24.370 --> 00:18:28.230
John subsequently flew 50 combat missions in the P 38 lightening fighter on many

342
00:18:28.231 --> 00:18:31.830
of which he bombs targets and reportedly even shot down Japanese fighter planes.

343
00:18:39.230 --> 00:18:43.040
Maureen Lindbergh had four more children after the war was over while living in

344
00:18:43.041 --> 00:18:44.090
Darien, Connecticut,

345
00:18:44.330 --> 00:18:47.510
even some 20 years after its historic transatlantic crossing,

346
00:18:47.540 --> 00:18:51.380
Charles was in high demand and he only saw his children a few months out of the

347
00:18:51.381 --> 00:18:51.800
year.

348
00:18:51.800 --> 00:18:55.400
He served a number of enterprises as a consultant from the chief of staff of the

349
00:18:55.401 --> 00:18:59.060
air force to the private company. Pan-American airways later in life,

350
00:18:59.090 --> 00:19:02.510
Charles moved to Hawaii where he focused his efforts on environmental causes,

351
00:19:02.511 --> 00:19:06.170
such as protection of foreign, dangerous species, as well as the Messiah tribe.

352
00:19:06.290 --> 00:19:09.590
And the loss of Africa earns the tacit eight people on the Philippine islands of

353
00:19:09.800 --> 00:19:10.633
Mindanao.

354
00:19:10.820 --> 00:19:14.480
He also established a national park on the Hawaiian Island Maui during the

355
00:19:14.481 --> 00:19:16.040
post-war period of Charles's life.

356
00:19:16.130 --> 00:19:18.080
You also make numerous trips to Europe and yes,

357
00:19:18.081 --> 00:19:22.970
another controversial endeavor involving Germany between 1958 and 1967,

358
00:19:23.000 --> 00:19:26.480
Charles fathered seven additional children to three different mistresses in

359
00:19:26.481 --> 00:19:28.340
Germany. Two of whom were sisters.

360
00:19:28.400 --> 00:19:31.940
These seven children were completely unaware of their father's true identity as

361
00:19:31.941 --> 00:19:35.420
he would only visit them once or twice a year using the pseudonym. Kara again,

362
00:19:35.780 --> 00:19:37.490
even when laying down on his deathbed,

363
00:19:37.640 --> 00:19:40.220
Charles wrote letters to his three German mistresses,

364
00:19:40.280 --> 00:19:44.210
urging them to keep quiet about Israel identity and adulterous behavior.

365
00:19:44.420 --> 00:19:48.110
It was not until over a decade after Charles Lindbergh's death in 1974,

366
00:19:48.111 --> 00:19:52.010
that is illegitimate daughter Astrid discovered her father's true identity by

367
00:19:52.011 --> 00:19:54.830
reading a magazine article about him shortly thereafter. She,

368
00:19:55.220 --> 00:19:58.370
after approximately 150 love letters from Lindbergh to her mother,

369
00:19:58.550 --> 00:20:03.320
along with some photographs to DNA tests in 2003 confirmed asteroid suspicion,

370
00:20:03.321 --> 00:20:07.640
and she made the news public causing a media storm in two separate chapters of

371
00:20:07.641 --> 00:20:11.090
Lindbergh's life. He engaged in secretive activities involving Germany,

372
00:20:11.150 --> 00:20:15.110
whether the strong Nazi affiliations in the years leading to global conflict or

373
00:20:15.260 --> 00:20:18.260
the seven unclaimed children, he fathered two decades later.

374
00:20:18.320 --> 00:20:21.410
It is clear that there are certain aspects of Charles's life that he wished to

375
00:20:21.411 --> 00:20:23.750
keep privates each time. These events surface,

376
00:20:23.780 --> 00:20:27.410
they caused conflicting feelings among the American people about who Charles

377
00:20:27.411 --> 00:20:30.380
Lindbergh is. The man really wants. In many cases,

378
00:20:30.381 --> 00:20:34.250
it is possible to detach a public celebrity from their personal activities as

379
00:20:34.940 --> 00:20:38.840
Joel's would have hoped that as this dark secret spilled onto the front pages of

380
00:20:38.841 --> 00:20:39.674
the newspapers,

381
00:20:39.770 --> 00:20:43.690
this proved impossible for a man whose political and personal ideals, constant,

382
00:20:43.691 --> 00:20:46.970
a long shadow of doubt over such a full achievement rich.

383
