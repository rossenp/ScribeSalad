internet experience. Now,

6
00:00:22.130 --> 00:00:25.760
There are a handful of writers throughout history whose men names somehow

7
00:00:25.940 --> 00:00:30.290
conjures up everything they were about. If someone says Stephen King,

8
00:00:30.320 --> 00:00:32.660
you think of a master of horror.

9
00:00:32.690 --> 00:00:35.960
Agatha Christie makes one think about detective mysteries.

10
00:00:36.020 --> 00:00:39.950
Mark Twain has a similar effect since we connect him with a smarmy witty

11
00:00:40.010 --> 00:00:42.650
affectionately [inaudible] type of writing.

12
00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:46.130
He's widely considered to be one of the most important humorists in American

13
00:00:46.131 --> 00:00:49.550
history, responsible for creating several world famous novels.

14
00:00:49.820 --> 00:00:53.390
If an author worked all of their lives and only created the adventures of Tom

15
00:00:53.391 --> 00:00:56.420
Sawyer, that would be considered a successful career.

16
00:00:56.480 --> 00:00:59.510
Mark Twain produced that timeless classic can many more.

17
00:00:59.720 --> 00:01:03.110
Today we're going to dive deeper into the complicated, hilarious,

18
00:01:03.111 --> 00:01:05.600
sometimes radical life of mystery.

19
00:01:12.740 --> 00:01:17.090
Swain was actually born Samuel Clemens on November the 30th, 1835 in Florida,

20
00:01:17.091 --> 00:01:18.890
Missouri as one of seven children.

21
00:01:18.891 --> 00:01:21.380
He quickly watched many of his siblings to come and die.

22
00:01:21.381 --> 00:01:25.550
During childhood only three Clemens children reached adult at the age of four.

23
00:01:25.580 --> 00:01:29.270
Samuel moved with his family to the town of Hannibal situated on the Mississippi

24
00:01:29.271 --> 00:01:30.170
river. His father,

25
00:01:30.171 --> 00:01:34.400
John Marshall Clemens worked as a sometimes attorney and sometimes judge

26
00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:38.510
Samuel's mother was named Jane who hailed from Kentucky during his childhood.

27
00:01:38.511 --> 00:01:42.530
Samuel would often play around the port of Hannibal swimming and fishing and

28
00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:45.350
creating memories that would inform his future works.

29
00:01:45.380 --> 00:01:49.280
John Clemens took ill with pneumonia when Samuel was 11 and passed away,

30
00:01:49.310 --> 00:01:52.460
they hadn't much to speak for financially even before he died,

31
00:01:52.490 --> 00:01:55.700
but they were especially bad off afterwards. Even at his young age,

32
00:01:55.701 --> 00:01:59.060
Samuel had to find work to help around the house all while still continuing his

33
00:01:59.061 --> 00:02:00.050
education at school,

34
00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:04.400
still money was a pressing enough need that he eventually had to quit classes

35
00:02:04.550 --> 00:02:07.190
all together. After the fifth grade, interestingly enough,

36
00:02:07.191 --> 00:02:09.800
some of the first jobs he had were the local newspapers.

37
00:02:09.830 --> 00:02:13.820
He operated presses for one and wrote short stories for another.

38
00:02:13.850 --> 00:02:15.470
By the time he reached the age of 18,

39
00:02:15.500 --> 00:02:19.550
he struck out of a small Missouri town and headed for the brighter working

40
00:02:19.551 --> 00:02:23.510
environs of the big city, moving from New York city to Philadelphia to St.

41
00:02:23.511 --> 00:02:24.470
Louis, tell me all,

42
00:02:24.471 --> 00:02:28.970
even joined a printers trade union while continuing his education on his own by

43
00:02:28.971 --> 00:02:31.100
visiting the vast libraries at the cities,

44
00:02:31.101 --> 00:02:35.000
in which he dwelled the water seemed to still call to him the river and docks,

45
00:02:35.001 --> 00:02:35.571
where he grew up,

46
00:02:35.571 --> 00:02:39.200
had a hold over him and he wanted to learn how best to traverse them.

47
00:02:39.290 --> 00:02:41.810
The idea of becoming a boat pilots in trans Stemmons.

48
00:02:42.110 --> 00:02:45.560
He took on an apprenticeship with a licensed steam boat pilots learn how to

49
00:02:45.561 --> 00:02:47.900
navigate the mighty Mississippi and navigate.

50
00:02:47.960 --> 00:02:52.550
He did reading the currents and learning how to avoid the dangers that any pilot

51
00:02:52.551 --> 00:02:54.770
could encounter on such a huge body of water.

52
00:02:54.771 --> 00:02:58.250
And in two years he and his license, he also encountered it. Um,

53
00:02:58.251 --> 00:03:02.260
that would stick with it was a standard depth of water that was safe for a steam

54
00:03:02.470 --> 00:03:07.300
boat to travel in equal to 12 feet or two fathoms known to Boltzmann as Mark

55
00:03:07.301 --> 00:03:10.330
Twain. He would also soon adopt it as it's pending

56
00:03:17.430 --> 00:03:20.610
War began to brew in 1861 Clemens. Now age 26,

57
00:03:20.990 --> 00:03:22.770
decided to destroy a house in the American West.

58
00:03:22.950 --> 00:03:25.200
He had served on the Mississippi for a few years,

59
00:03:25.201 --> 00:03:29.190
even offering his brother Henry a job on a Steamboat that partnership ended in

60
00:03:29.191 --> 00:03:32.940
tragedy as Henry was killed. When the boat's boiler went up in flames,

61
00:03:33.030 --> 00:03:36.930
Samuel was beside himself with grief and then seeing the brother against brother

62
00:03:36.931 --> 00:03:39.270
conflict of the civil war rearing its ugly hand.

63
00:03:39.480 --> 00:03:43.800
He finally decided to take a new opportunity working in Nevada with another

64
00:03:43.801 --> 00:03:44.940
sibling, Iran,

65
00:03:45.140 --> 00:03:48.840
Iran and Clemens became the secretary of the Nevada territory in 1861,

66
00:03:48.841 --> 00:03:50.490
working under governor James knife,

67
00:03:51.060 --> 00:03:54.810
Samuel joined a rod and the two headed West on a two week stagecoach trip.

68
00:03:54.870 --> 00:03:58.020
He decided to leave the voyage and set foot in Virginia city, Nevada,

69
00:03:58.021 --> 00:03:59.430
where he tried his luck at mining.

70
00:03:59.520 --> 00:04:02.760
It didn't last long and he soon took a more familiar position at the local

71
00:04:02.761 --> 00:04:03.240
paper.

72
00:04:03.240 --> 00:04:06.600
This is notable because it was the first time he officially used his pen name,

73
00:04:06.780 --> 00:04:09.480
Mark Twain in an 1863 humor piece.

74
00:04:09.540 --> 00:04:13.950
So this is what we shall refer to him as from now on Mark Twain would tuck away

75
00:04:13.951 --> 00:04:17.550
all sorts of experiences and stories he gained while spending time in the West,

76
00:04:17.580 --> 00:04:21.690
traveling to San Francisco and enjoying the weather and fruits that California

77
00:04:21.691 --> 00:04:25.410
had to offer. During this time he produced his first published success.

78
00:04:25.411 --> 00:04:28.620
The celebrated jumping frog of Calaveras County,

79
00:04:28.650 --> 00:04:32.550
which was printed in a New York paper and quickly gains in the following in

80
00:04:32.551 --> 00:04:36.210
1867, Twain was offered a chance to tour Europe and the Mediterranean with this

81
00:04:36.211 --> 00:04:39.840
newspaper employer footing the bill. These travels inspired the work,

82
00:04:39.870 --> 00:04:42.420
the innocence abroad, but also on the trip.

83
00:04:42.421 --> 00:04:45.540
He befriended a fellow passenger named Charles Langdon.

84
00:04:45.570 --> 00:04:47.940
When Langdon showed Mark a photograph of his sister,

85
00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:52.200
Olivia Twain was taken aback by her beauty and fell in love instantly the two

86
00:04:52.260 --> 00:04:54.090
who kept in contact for the next two years,

87
00:04:54.480 --> 00:04:58.500
Twain trying to compel her to marry him once, but she rejected him in February,

88
00:04:58.500 --> 00:05:02.160
1870 Olivia finally relented and the do were weds in New York where they would

89
00:05:02.161 --> 00:05:05.430
live for a time. Now, just before we get into the rest of today's video,

90
00:05:05.520 --> 00:05:08.160
would you want to take a quick moment to tell you about today's sponsor Nord

91
00:05:08.161 --> 00:05:11.100
VPN. Now, if you're online, you really must be using a VPN.

92
00:05:11.101 --> 00:05:12.780
And that's where Nord VPN comes in.

93
00:05:12.870 --> 00:05:15.720
I know it's tempting not to bother sorta just hope for the best, but ready,

94
00:05:15.721 --> 00:05:19.110
those stories you read about people having that data stolen, they do happen,

95
00:05:19.500 --> 00:05:22.260
and you don't want to make it easy for anyone to do that to you.

96
00:05:22.261 --> 00:05:25.920
Whether it's a nefarious actor snooping for your private information or

97
00:05:26.430 --> 00:05:30.480
companies tracking your activity, but using a VPN can be about so much more.

98
00:05:30.481 --> 00:05:31.314
For example,

99
00:05:31.320 --> 00:05:35.040
nor VPN lets you access any of its thousands of servers in different countries,

100
00:05:35.041 --> 00:05:38.370
all around the globe. So if you hit the end of your Netflix queue,

101
00:05:38.371 --> 00:05:42.360
simply try changing the location of your server and get access to content

102
00:05:42.361 --> 00:05:46.200
libraries that due to licensing agreements are going to be available in specific

103
00:05:46.201 --> 00:05:48.540
geographic locations. I'm random to that problem.

104
00:05:48.541 --> 00:05:51.630
I think in the past with mad men, it was available in America,

105
00:05:51.660 --> 00:05:55.440
but not in Europe. So VPN definitely solve that problem.

106
00:05:55.770 --> 00:05:58.430
No VPN is also super fast. Watching a video is a breeze.

107
00:05:58.431 --> 00:06:02.090
There's no lag whatsoever. If you've ever thought VPNs were slow. Well,

108
00:06:02.420 --> 00:06:05.900
no more with Nord VPN. And so you can use it on all of your devices,

109
00:06:05.901 --> 00:06:08.300
very easily, Android Chrome windows, Linux,

110
00:06:08.540 --> 00:06:11.510
and on six different devices with just one accounts.

111
00:06:11.570 --> 00:06:13.160
Also there are no logs at all.

112
00:06:13.161 --> 00:06:17.450
Unlike companies that are based in the EU or the U S nor VPN is over in Panama.

113
00:06:17.720 --> 00:06:20.720
So they didn't have to keep logs at all, which is great for your privacy.

114
00:06:20.810 --> 00:06:23.420
So take control of your internet experience right now,

115

internet experience.

118
00:06:33.430 --> 00:06:34.263
<v 1>Right?</v>

119
00:06:39.880 --> 00:06:44.170
<v 0>73 Twain and Olivia would begin to set some roots in Hartford, Connecticut.</v>

120
00:06:44.260 --> 00:06:45.280
They had a home built.

121
00:06:45.490 --> 00:06:48.700
Olivia had a separate part of the house designed for Mark to be able to write in

122
00:06:48.701 --> 00:06:51.220
and smoke his cigars habit sheet to test it.

123
00:06:51.400 --> 00:06:54.550
The Hartford house was where Twain would produce some of his most treasured

124
00:06:54.551 --> 00:06:58.030
classics, that three daughters while they resided there as well.

125
00:06:58.480 --> 00:07:02.230
Susie Clara and Jean, the next door neighbor was Hamlet, Beecher Stowe,

126
00:07:02.231 --> 00:07:05.140
author of uncle Tom's cabin. When they went on summer vacation,

127
00:07:05.141 --> 00:07:08.560
they visited Olivia's sister who lived in the same town in which they were

128
00:07:08.561 --> 00:07:10.690
married and spent time with a wealthy family.

129
00:07:10.810 --> 00:07:14.260
Twain would use these rest bites to upstate New York to write as well.

130
00:07:14.320 --> 00:07:18.340
His writings were gaining him more and more of an audience by these times.

131
00:07:18.460 --> 00:07:21.910
But 1876 is the adventures of Tom Sawyer was the novel that brought him

132
00:07:21.911 --> 00:07:23.350
worldwide. Acclaim Twain,

133
00:07:23.620 --> 00:07:26.860
leaned every experience you had from his childhood to bring a story to life of

134
00:07:27.010 --> 00:07:30.880
the young titular character and his times growing up along the Mississippi

135
00:07:30.881 --> 00:07:34.480
river, it was also one of the first novels created on a typewriter,

136
00:07:34.540 --> 00:07:37.000
considered an absolute classic of American literature.

137
00:07:37.150 --> 00:07:39.940
Tom Sawyer set him on a streak of successes.

138
00:07:40.060 --> 00:07:43.900
He was making money and traveling all over the country on leisure sockets.

139
00:07:44.050 --> 00:07:48.490
He also really loved writing travel books as evidenced by 1880s of tramp abroad,

140
00:07:48.491 --> 00:07:51.790
which detailed Twain and his time in Germany, France and Switzerland,

141
00:07:52.000 --> 00:07:55.870
the book offered a taste of his wit with the classic fish out of water device

142
00:07:55.871 --> 00:07:58.540
playing well with an American out of his element in Europe,

143
00:07:58.570 --> 00:08:02.470
the Prince and the pulper was released in 1881. Twain was now on a roll.

144
00:08:02.500 --> 00:08:06.340
The tale dealt with two characters. You switch identities in 16th century,

145
00:08:06.341 --> 00:08:10.540
England Twain use the plot to expose social injustice and show just how

146
00:08:10.570 --> 00:08:12.880
differently separate classes of people were.

147
00:08:13.180 --> 00:08:15.730
And always have been in 1883 Twain again,

148
00:08:15.731 --> 00:08:19.480
revisited his beloved river routes in life. On the Mississippi. With this,

149
00:08:19.481 --> 00:08:22.960
he actually turned a bit scholarly educating on the history of the river bus

150
00:08:22.961 --> 00:08:26.410
with a bit of his riverboat pioneering expertise sprinkled in life on the

151
00:08:26.411 --> 00:08:30.520
Mississippi. It was almost a prime of a Twain, however, as he would in 1884,

152
00:08:30.850 --> 00:08:33.730
flesh out one of old Tom Sawyer as friends for a novel of his own,

153
00:08:33.940 --> 00:08:38.080
the adventures of huckleberry Finn huckleberry Finn would take on an even more

154
00:08:38.081 --> 00:08:41.050
socially conscious SLAM's than much of his previous work.

155
00:08:41.140 --> 00:08:44.260
As Twain looked at the burning wasteland of the civil war and the way that

156
00:08:44.261 --> 00:08:45.880
African-Americans were being treated,

157
00:08:46.480 --> 00:08:48.520
turning a mirror on Americans in the process,

158
00:08:48.640 --> 00:08:51.310
1889 is a Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's court.

159
00:08:51.370 --> 00:08:54.580
It was one of Twain's last big novels, and it's a man wakes up,

160
00:08:54.581 --> 00:08:58.920
suddenly thrust into the time of King Arthur Twain was able to implement much of

161
00:08:58.921 --> 00:09:01.680
his darker cynical signs that was creeping in.

162
00:09:01.681 --> 00:09:03.240
As he approached his golden years,

163
00:09:03.300 --> 00:09:06.930
there would be much more to be dark and cynical about. He would soon.

164
00:09:07.190 --> 00:09:08.023
<v 3>Yeah.</v>

165
00:09:14.270 --> 00:09:17.240
<v 0>Swain actually used his own publishing company for the first time in the</v>

166
00:09:17.241 --> 00:09:18.560
printing of huckleberry Finn.

167
00:09:18.620 --> 00:09:22.100
He was keen to maintain artistic control and make the money that his art was

168
00:09:22.101 --> 00:09:22.730
bringing in.

169
00:09:22.730 --> 00:09:25.790
It would make you think that Twain had a good sense of finances and how to spend

170
00:09:25.791 --> 00:09:29.360
it wisely, but you would be wrong. He was terrible at investing money.

171
00:09:29.540 --> 00:09:33.080
He was amazed by technology and often through vast sums of money at new

172
00:09:33.081 --> 00:09:35.390
inventions that he thought would change the world.

173
00:09:35.540 --> 00:09:40.100
The page typesetting machine was a glorious failure that he loved with his heart

174
00:09:40.310 --> 00:09:41.143
and his wallet.

175
00:09:41.150 --> 00:09:44.810
The world was evolving at such a rate and newspapers and print was blowing up so

176
00:09:44.811 --> 00:09:47.750
fast that handset type machines simply couldn't contact anymore.

177
00:09:47.900 --> 00:09:50.930
The page machine promised to take Prince into the new world,

178
00:09:50.960 --> 00:09:54.620
but it requires such precise calibration and constant maintenance that it became

179
00:09:54.621 --> 00:09:57.050
obsolete almost as soon as it was released.

180
00:09:57.050 --> 00:09:59.780
And it was left behind by smarter quicker machines,

181
00:09:59.840 --> 00:10:02.660
Twain poured around $300,000 of his own money,

182
00:10:02.810 --> 00:10:04.730
trying to keep the page typesetter afloat,

183
00:10:04.880 --> 00:10:08.480
which is over $9 million in today's money.

184
00:10:08.690 --> 00:10:10.280
He continually dipped into the money.

185
00:10:10.281 --> 00:10:13.970
He had earned from his books and even his wife's family inheritance to keep the

186
00:10:14.180 --> 00:10:16.850
dying machine afloat. But in the end, it was all for naught.

187
00:10:16.940 --> 00:10:20.360
Even as publishing companies struggled to turn a profit and things got so bad

188
00:10:20.361 --> 00:10:21.194
between that,

189
00:10:21.230 --> 00:10:24.710
they had to shutter their Connecticut home and set up meager accommodations in

190
00:10:24.711 --> 00:10:26.930
Europe, sometime in the 1890s,

191
00:10:26.931 --> 00:10:30.140
Twain struck up a friendship with a mercurial inventor, Nikola Tesla.

192
00:10:30.350 --> 00:10:32.600
Tesla was resigning in New York city at the time.

193
00:10:32.601 --> 00:10:34.670
And Twain often visited the metropolis,

194
00:10:34.671 --> 00:10:38.660
especially after he got wind of some of the amazing inventions that Tesla was

195
00:10:38.661 --> 00:10:39.320
concocting.

196
00:10:39.320 --> 00:10:43.070
Tesla was a scientist Westinghouse at the time and was working on a new kind of

197
00:10:43.071 --> 00:10:47.480
electric motor Twain was a frequent visitor to Tesla's lab and loved interacting

198
00:10:47.481 --> 00:10:48.950
with his new gadgets and devices.

199
00:10:48.980 --> 00:10:52.610
One such device Tesla was creating involved a vibrating oscillator machine,

200
00:10:52.611 --> 00:10:56.300
which was basically an engine that put out high frequencies Tesla ones.

201
00:10:56.390 --> 00:10:58.790
And if there could be any health benefits that could be gained from the

202
00:10:58.791 --> 00:11:00.320
invention and knew that his friends,

203
00:11:00.321 --> 00:11:03.680
Mark Twain sometimes suffered from digestive problems and constipation,

204
00:11:04.190 --> 00:11:08.270
Dwayne got on the machine and instantly felt sensations of like Talenti until

205
00:11:08.300 --> 00:11:12.650
such time that the machine rattled his bowels and off to effectively cure him

206
00:11:13.220 --> 00:11:15.080
train. And Tesla continued that friendship for years,

207
00:11:15.110 --> 00:11:19.100
Tesla reportedly tried out an x-ray gun and shot it. Twain's head.

208
00:11:19.550 --> 00:11:22.490
Tesla was invited to Twain's daughter's wedding, Hank Morgan,

209
00:11:22.491 --> 00:11:24.410
the time-traveling character in Twain's,

210
00:11:24.411 --> 00:11:28.220
a Connecticut Yankee and going off his course may have been based on the

211
00:11:28.221 --> 00:11:32.270
eccentric Tesla Twain had to embark on a worldwide tour of lectures to try and

212
00:11:32.271 --> 00:11:36.320
get the family back into profits in 1896 Twain's 24 year old daughter.

213
00:11:36.320 --> 00:11:39.260
Susie was visiting that Connecticut hometown when she was struck with

214
00:11:39.261 --> 00:11:40.850
meningitis, sadly,

215
00:11:40.910 --> 00:11:44.900
she died from the onus and Mark Twain never returned to the place where his

216
00:11:44.901 --> 00:11:48.800
greatest love and fortunes had flowered citing the pain of her death.

217
00:11:49.040 --> 00:11:50.120
There being too much to bat.

218
00:11:50.660 --> 00:11:53.150
Dwayne didn't even return to the United States until 1900.

219
00:11:53.410 --> 00:11:54.520
When he moved to New York city,

220
00:11:54.670 --> 00:11:58.630
it was a period of deep dark depression and despair for Twain is rising,

221
00:11:58.631 --> 00:12:02.980
was reflecting the darker side of humanity and focusing its bobs at the failures

222
00:12:02.981 --> 00:12:05.680
of government and disappointment in humanity in general.

223
00:12:05.740 --> 00:12:08.770
He even publicly insulted Winston Churchill before introducing him.

224
00:12:08.890 --> 00:12:12.160
It's an event he began to be seen as a treasure of sorts,

225
00:12:12.161 --> 00:12:15.880
and many of his works during this time burns even properly released until after

226
00:12:15.881 --> 00:12:16.361
his death.

227
00:12:16.361 --> 00:12:19.900
When public opinion on him had come back around another unavoidable subject

228
00:12:19.901 --> 00:12:23.560
regarding Twain was his use of racial slurs and some of his work most notably

229
00:12:23.740 --> 00:12:25.540
the adventures of huckleberry Finn show,

230
00:12:25.550 --> 00:12:29.320
these types of words were unfortunately very common in the pre civil war era

231
00:12:29.321 --> 00:12:30.460
that the novel was set in,

232
00:12:30.670 --> 00:12:34.180
but it often led to schools and institutions banning the book out rights or

233
00:12:34.300 --> 00:12:35.540
limiting its readings.

234
00:12:35.910 --> 00:12:36.780
<v 4>Multiple times.</v>

235
00:12:43.650 --> 00:12:46.560
<v 0>Plane moved to Manhattan, New York city, not long after his daughter,</v>

236
00:12:46.561 --> 00:12:50.670
Susie passed away from meningitis in 1993, his beloved wife, Olivia took ill.

237
00:12:50.671 --> 00:12:53.730
So Twain moved them to Italy for a time where she eventually died.

238
00:12:53.731 --> 00:12:55.860
The next year. He then went into the breeze for a bit,

239
00:12:55.861 --> 00:12:59.040
moving back to New York city and eventually back to the state of Connecticut in

240
00:12:59.430 --> 00:13:00.330
Redding in 1996,

241
00:13:00.331 --> 00:13:03.720
a close friend of his had all their home and possessions destroyed in the

242
00:13:03.960 --> 00:13:07.410
infamous San Francisco earthquake train offered to autographs and portraits of

243
00:13:07.411 --> 00:13:09.090
himself to raise money, to help,

244
00:13:09.091 --> 00:13:11.250
and even had new portraits of himself commissions.

245
00:13:11.550 --> 00:13:14.250
It begins to pen chapters of his autobiography showing this.

246
00:13:14.550 --> 00:13:17.910
It was beginning to think of his own legacy and how the world should see him.

247
00:13:17.911 --> 00:13:21.420
Now that he was becoming aware that his own life was nearing its end.

248
00:13:21.660 --> 00:13:24.150
Also in 1906, he started a club for young girls,

249
00:13:24.151 --> 00:13:26.610
perhaps Owings at the loss of his own daughter, dubs,

250
00:13:26.611 --> 00:13:29.640
the angel fish and aquarium club and consisting of females,

251
00:13:29.641 --> 00:13:33.120
age 10 to 16 Twain cold, the starting of his foundation,

252
00:13:33.270 --> 00:13:34.680
his life's chief delight.

253
00:13:34.740 --> 00:13:38.190
They exchanged letters and went to plays and other social gatherings together,

254
00:13:38.280 --> 00:13:42.060
even befriended one 11 year olds named Dorothy quick on an ocean voyage,

255
00:13:42.061 --> 00:13:44.340
whom he remained close to until his last days,

256
00:13:44.700 --> 00:13:48.540
Dwayne didn't have the same prolific literacy output in his last years that he

257
00:13:48.541 --> 00:13:52.380
did when he was younger, 1890 threes put in, had Wilson Del Smithy,

258
00:13:52.381 --> 00:13:56.610
familiar idea of where two people switched positions and was hastily released to

259
00:13:56.611 --> 00:14:00.090
keep him from going completely broke. Bankruptcy did rear its ugly head.

260
00:14:00.120 --> 00:14:00.811
The next year.

261
00:14:00.811 --> 00:14:04.350
And Twain had to resort to doing articles for periodicals and reviews and

262
00:14:04.351 --> 00:14:07.770
newspapers to try and scrape together. Some funds once Olivia died,

263
00:14:07.771 --> 00:14:11.070
he began to release some works from his past that hadn't met a muster when she

264
00:14:11.071 --> 00:14:13.320
was alive, besides being the love of his life.

265
00:14:13.350 --> 00:14:16.350
She had obviously proven to be quite the editor for his famous works.

266
00:14:16.380 --> 00:14:19.860
Once that partnership was missing, the quality and tone was a lot more cynical.

267
00:14:20.040 --> 00:14:24.060
His autobiography was even a difficult venture for him as he thought it would be

268
00:14:24.061 --> 00:14:27.420
more entertaining to skip around time periods of his life,

269
00:14:27.421 --> 00:14:30.900
which is likely why frustrated historians have to wait a hundred years after

270
00:14:30.901 --> 00:14:32.370
Twain's death to release it.

271
00:14:32.670 --> 00:14:35.400
But that's exactly the length of time Mark Twain wanted.

272
00:14:35.401 --> 00:14:38.070
So maybe he was laughing from beyond the grave.

273
00:14:38.220 --> 00:14:40.080
There were many ups and many downs.

274
00:14:40.081 --> 00:14:43.710
Clara has middle daughter was married in 1909, but then his youngest daughter,

275
00:14:43.711 --> 00:14:46.200
Jean died the same year from an epileptic seizure.

276
00:14:46.260 --> 00:14:49.830
It was enough to nearly break the man and he swore he would never write another

277
00:14:49.831 --> 00:14:51.410
word again. After the tragedy,

278
00:14:51.500 --> 00:14:54.920
he instead took his bit of feelings out on the welds that he saw around him.

279
00:14:55.100 --> 00:14:58.550
He believed that America was overstepping its bounds on a global scale.

280
00:14:58.550 --> 00:15:02.000
And he vehemently spoke out against the war in the Philippines. And yes,

281
00:15:02.030 --> 00:15:05.420
of course still put pen to paper. So to speak. He released a novella,

282
00:15:05.421 --> 00:15:08.450
the man that corrupted Hadley Berger fictional piece,

283
00:15:08.451 --> 00:15:12.020
dealing with the evils that humans can create when left to their own devices.

284
00:15:12.021 --> 00:15:16.220
And the sins of vanity letters from earth came soon after a scathing review of

285
00:15:16.221 --> 00:15:20.150
religion in which Satan condemns the way humans blindly worship one,

286
00:15:20.151 --> 00:15:21.740
particularly striking passage goes,

287
00:15:21.770 --> 00:15:25.880
he prays for help and favor and protection every day. And does it with hope,

288
00:15:26.360 --> 00:15:30.230
furnace and confidence do, although no prayer of his has ever been answered.

289
00:15:30.620 --> 00:15:34.160
Twain still had trouble adjusting to a life without the love of his family.

290
00:15:34.161 --> 00:15:37.520
And so looked for brief connections whenever he could find them.

291
00:15:37.580 --> 00:15:41.240
He befriended local farmers and hosted parties for the big names of the time

292
00:15:41.241 --> 00:15:42.260
like Helen Keller,

293
00:15:42.290 --> 00:15:45.590
who he actually bestowed the famous nickname of the miracle worker,

294
00:15:45.710 --> 00:15:49.340
his humor dark as it was by this time extended even to his own approaching

295
00:15:49.820 --> 00:15:51.980
passing. When rumors of his demise would swell around.

296
00:15:52.100 --> 00:15:55.520
It'd be quick to jokes that the reports of my death was an exaggeration.

297
00:15:55.700 --> 00:15:59.360
When talk of his last moments arose, it was contemplated a distinguished man.

298
00:15:59.510 --> 00:16:03.650
It should be as particular about his last words as he is about his last breath.

299
00:16:03.770 --> 00:16:07.130
You should write them out on a slip of paper and take the judgment of his

300
00:16:07.131 --> 00:16:07.910
friends on them.

301
00:16:07.910 --> 00:16:11.540
He should never leave such a thing to the last hour of his life and trust to an

302
00:16:11.541 --> 00:16:13.280
intellectual spurt at the last moment,

303
00:16:13.281 --> 00:16:18.110
to enable him to say something smart with his last dust gasp and launch

304
00:16:18.170 --> 00:16:20.870
into eternity with grand jury in 1835,

305
00:16:20.900 --> 00:16:23.990
Halley's comet burst through the night sky on its closest known approach.

306
00:16:24.020 --> 00:16:27.800
Mark Twain was born two weeks after when the famous comment was set to make its

307
00:16:27.801 --> 00:16:30.890
next past. In 1910 Twain had big plans.

308
00:16:30.980 --> 00:16:34.310
He truly believed he was meant to come into the world with the comments and then

309
00:16:34.311 --> 00:16:38.570
to leave it on the next go around. And he did one day after it passed us.

310
00:16:38.720 --> 00:16:43.160
The two unaccountable freaks as he remarked came in and went out together,

311
00:16:43.670 --> 00:16:44.000
all Twain,

312
00:16:44.000 --> 00:16:48.560
put a special emphasis on the importance of one's last words he didn't fail to

313
00:16:48.561 --> 00:16:50.270
deliver while on his deathbed seat.

314
00:16:50.300 --> 00:16:53.450
First pointed to a stack of unfinished written works and dotted to his

315
00:16:53.451 --> 00:16:57.650
biographer throwaway. He then held the hands of his last remaining daughter,

316
00:16:58.220 --> 00:17:02.870
Claire. And during a short goodbye spoke if we meet famous last words.

317
00:17:07.690 --> 00:17:09.910
