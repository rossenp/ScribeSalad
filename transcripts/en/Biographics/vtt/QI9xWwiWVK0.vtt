00:00:00.180 --> 00:00:02.010
<v 0>How do you measure the success of a pirate?</v>

2
00:00:02.190 --> 00:00:04.200
Is it by Fein is by the number of ships.

3
00:00:04.201 --> 00:00:05.970
They Congo to all the amounts of treasure.

4
00:00:05.971 --> 00:00:10.800
They pillaged surely Henry every deserves to be in contention for the title of

5
00:00:10.801 --> 00:00:12.480
most successful pirates in history,

6
00:00:12.481 --> 00:00:16.170
because he was responsible for the single most profitable pirate rate in

7
00:00:16.171 --> 00:00:16.890
history.

8
00:00:16.890 --> 00:00:21.720
Just one school that netted every and his crew around $600,000 in

9
00:00:21.721 --> 00:00:22.740
golden jewels,

10
00:00:22.860 --> 00:00:26.430
the plums was so large that it resulted in what many considered to be the first

11
00:00:26.431 --> 00:00:28.740
global mansions in history as Henry,

12
00:00:28.741 --> 00:00:31.230
every became the most wanted man on the planet.

13
00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:34.590
Well then every accomplished something almost unheard of in his line of work,

14
00:00:34.591 --> 00:00:37.380
something that almost no other famous pirate managed to do,

15
00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:42.150
he got away with it back then pirates were fated to meet their end either at the

16
00:00:42.151 --> 00:00:46.230
bottom of Davy Jones, his locker, or at the end of her rope at the gallows.

17
00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:48.510
But Henry every got his big score,

18
00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:52.710
took his share of the treasure and disappeared into the midst of time.

19
00:00:52.711 --> 00:00:57.660
Never to be heard from again, this alone truly made him worthy of the sobriquet.

20
00:00:57.900 --> 00:00:59.220
The King of pirates.

21
00:01:11.150 --> 00:01:11.630
<v 1>[Inaudible].</v>

22
00:01:11.630 --> 00:01:12.980
<v 0>This is the case with other pirates.</v>

23
00:01:12.981 --> 00:01:16.370
We find ourselves knocking a lot of credible sources on the early life of Henry.

24
00:01:16.670 --> 00:01:18.950
Every, sometimes he spelled his name, Avery burst.

25
00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:21.710
He also went by a few other monikers throughout his career,

26
00:01:21.711 --> 00:01:24.890
such as Benjamin Bridgeman, long Ben and John Avery,

27
00:01:25.040 --> 00:01:27.410
which is believed to have been the name of his father.

28
00:01:27.500 --> 00:01:31.370
He was born most likely in 1653 or 1659,

29
00:01:31.371 --> 00:01:35.000
depending on the source near the English port city of Plymouth in the County of

30
00:01:35.001 --> 00:01:39.020
Devon, his parents were probably John and Anne every and some historians have

31
00:01:39.021 --> 00:01:42.590
speculated that they may have been connected to the prominent every family which

32
00:01:42.591 --> 00:01:47.000
owned a lot of land in Devin and even had a branch that became baronets Henry

33
00:01:47.001 --> 00:01:49.070
every took to the sea from a young age,

34
00:01:49.430 --> 00:01:52.550
serving on both merchants and Royal Navy ships. According to one account,

35
00:01:52.551 --> 00:01:57.530
every was part of the English fleet, the bombarded outages, and 1671.

36
00:01:57.590 --> 00:02:01.070
He served as the captain of a log would freighter in the Bay of campy in the

37
00:02:01.071 --> 00:02:05.090
Gulf of Mexico, and also traveled to the Caribbean for a while,

38
00:02:05.091 --> 00:02:06.680
where he operated as a buck. And yet,

39
00:02:06.770 --> 00:02:10.310
unfortunately all of these stories come from a contemporary book called the life

40
00:02:10.311 --> 00:02:13.940
and adventures of captain John Avery published in 1709.

41
00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:18.620
It was written by Adrian van brogues pseudonym of a man who claimed he was a

42
00:02:18.621 --> 00:02:21.680
captive of every during his pirating days. Unfortunately,

43
00:02:21.681 --> 00:02:25.130
there is absolutely nothing to corroborate his tails and the book has been

44
00:02:25.131 --> 00:02:29.630
dismissed as almost certainly a work of fiction with the occasional truth

45
00:02:29.631 --> 00:02:30.260
included.

46
00:02:30.260 --> 00:02:33.620
We get a better understanding of every career off to the breakouts of the nine

47
00:02:33.860 --> 00:02:35.300
years' war in 1688.

48
00:02:35.510 --> 00:02:38.900
It was four between France on the one side and pretty much all the other

49
00:02:38.901 --> 00:02:40.430
European powers. On the other side,

50
00:02:40.431 --> 00:02:44.840
who formed a coalition known as the grand Alliance. We first hear of every,

51
00:02:44.870 --> 00:02:47.160
when he was in his early thirties, serving as a midshipman,

52
00:02:47.161 --> 00:02:49.400
a the 64 gun ship of the line,

53
00:02:49.640 --> 00:02:54.050
HMS report records also seem to indicate that he already had a family at this

54
00:02:54.051 --> 00:02:57.470
point and D had sent them most of his wages in 1689.

55
00:02:57.471 --> 00:03:01.480
The HMS report played an important in capturing a French convoy off the coast of

56
00:03:01.481 --> 00:03:05.080
the port city of breasts, following the success. Most officers board,

57
00:03:05.081 --> 00:03:09.400
the warships received promotions, including every who became a masters meet,

58
00:03:09.430 --> 00:03:11.470
which is a title that doesn't exist anymore.

59
00:03:11.530 --> 00:03:13.750
It is probable that the captain of the ships,

60
00:03:13.751 --> 00:03:16.630
a Francis Wheeler took every with him the following year,

61
00:03:16.631 --> 00:03:18.370
when he was put in charge of a launch,

62
00:03:18.371 --> 00:03:23.350
it deadly at 90 gun ship called the HMS Abel, Mel, if this is true,

63
00:03:23.380 --> 00:03:27.070
then it's also likely that every participated in the battle of beachy head on

64
00:03:27.071 --> 00:03:31.450
July, the 10th, 60 90, which ended up being a crushing defeat, the English,

65
00:03:31.660 --> 00:03:35.650
it seems that he was discharged from the Royal Navy the following month

66
00:03:35.770 --> 00:03:39.370
afterwards, it appears that Henry Everi joins the slave trade for a few years.

67
00:03:39.820 --> 00:03:41.710
Although this part of his life is poorly documented.

68
00:03:41.711 --> 00:03:45.580
So we don't know what ships he served the board and what ranks. You had

69
00:03:52.380 --> 00:03:57.210
1693 Henry every joined a new venture called Spanish expedition shipping at the

70
00:03:57.211 --> 00:04:00.750
time the West Indies and the Caribbean sea were split between the Spanish and

71
00:04:00.751 --> 00:04:04.230
the French who were still at war with each other. Spain was England's allies.

72
00:04:04.260 --> 00:04:07.440
So a group of wealthy London, merchants forms this expedition,

73
00:04:07.441 --> 00:04:12.090
which consisted of three frigates and a pink, the flagship being the Charles,

74
00:04:12.091 --> 00:04:13.980
the second's named off to the King of Spain.

75
00:04:14.280 --> 00:04:17.730
The mission was to travel to the Spanish West Indies to trade salvage,

76
00:04:17.731 --> 00:04:20.580
supply the Spanish with guns. And most importantly,

77
00:04:20.670 --> 00:04:22.740
it plums are all the friendships that they met along the way.

78
00:04:22.920 --> 00:04:26.640
Basically they were English privateers under a commissioned by the Spanish King,

79
00:04:26.670 --> 00:04:30.480
based on his record and experience Henry every was made first made of the

80
00:04:30.481 --> 00:04:34.260
Charles the second's. This seems like a pretty sweet gig at first,

81
00:04:34.261 --> 00:04:38.040
but it quickly went South as one bad thing happens after another first,

82
00:04:38.041 --> 00:04:41.310
the original captain of the Charles the second died while the ship was still in

83
00:04:41.311 --> 00:04:43.500
port. When the fleet finally left England,

84
00:04:43.740 --> 00:04:46.140
it headed for the Spanish city of Karuna. However,

85
00:04:46.170 --> 00:04:48.750
thanks to delays and bad weather, the trip,

86
00:04:48.751 --> 00:04:51.570
which was supposed to take two weeks and lasted five months.

87
00:04:51.720 --> 00:04:53.550
When they finally found themselves in Spain,

88
00:04:53.551 --> 00:04:57.120
they have to sit and pause for a few more months because the necessary paperwork

89
00:04:57.121 --> 00:04:59.250
and not yet arrived during all this time,

90
00:04:59.251 --> 00:05:02.460
just waiting around the men weren't getting paid and they were becoming

91
00:05:02.461 --> 00:05:05.850
desperate upon joining the expedition. They had been given one months,

92
00:05:06.030 --> 00:05:09.360
pay in advance and promised a guaranteed salary to be paid every six months.

93
00:05:09.390 --> 00:05:12.090
Once the ships were finally getting ready to leave for the West Indies,

94
00:05:12.091 --> 00:05:16.170
the crew demanded the six months wages before heading out their request was

95
00:05:16.171 --> 00:05:20.310
denied. And unsurprisingly, this endeavor only had one possible outcome.

96
00:05:20.580 --> 00:05:24.300
And that of course is mutinied according to reports from sailors who stayed

97
00:05:24.301 --> 00:05:27.420
behind Henry. Every was one of the driving forces behind the mutiny,

98
00:05:27.570 --> 00:05:31.020
going from ship to ship and talking to all of the men to persuade them,

99
00:05:31.021 --> 00:05:33.690
to join us site on may the seventh, 1694,

100
00:05:33.691 --> 00:05:37.320
he and dozens of sailors storms the Charles the second and took the rest of its

101
00:05:37.321 --> 00:05:38.340
crew by surprise,

102
00:05:38.400 --> 00:05:41.220
before the other ships realized what was happening into time to react,

103
00:05:41.400 --> 00:05:44.940
he took the flagship into open water. Once they were far enough from Spain,

104
00:05:44.941 --> 00:05:48.390
the former captain and all of the men who did not want to join were placed in a

105
00:05:48.391 --> 00:05:50.040
boot and allowed to go to shore.

106
00:05:50.100 --> 00:05:53.310
The only one who was forced to stay was the ship surgeon,

107
00:05:53.311 --> 00:05:55.710
as his services would be valuable to forgo Henry.

108
00:05:56.010 --> 00:06:00.080
Every was named the new and he rechristened the ship of the fancy.

109
00:06:06.040 --> 00:06:06.310
<v 1>[Inaudible].</v>

110
00:06:06.310 --> 00:06:09.670
<v 0>Now there's Henry ever. He was a pirate and D at a ship and D at a crew.</v>

111
00:06:09.671 --> 00:06:14.470
He needed one more thing. And that was a destination. Where should they head to,

112
00:06:14.560 --> 00:06:19.270
to engage in radical ways? Well, back then there was a popular sailing routes,

113
00:06:19.300 --> 00:06:24.190
particularly used by English core says w simply there's a pirate around which

114
00:06:24.220 --> 00:06:28.300
targeted the many merchant ships that traveled between North America or Western

115
00:06:28.301 --> 00:06:29.770
Europe and Southern Asia.

116
00:06:29.830 --> 00:06:32.680
It started from the Atlantic ocean that rounded the tip of Africa,

117
00:06:33.040 --> 00:06:35.890
POS the Cape of good height with a stop on Madagascar.

118
00:06:36.070 --> 00:06:39.610
Back then this Island was a safe Haven for pirates and a great place where

119
00:06:40.330 --> 00:06:44.200
resupply ends before ship maintenance from that they would set various

120
00:06:44.201 --> 00:06:47.710
destinations, which allow them to prowl the Indian ocean, looking for Tongans.

121
00:06:47.740 --> 00:06:48.573
In fact,

122
00:06:48.580 --> 00:06:51.940
every was one of the pirates who popularized this route since it was here,

123
00:06:52.390 --> 00:06:54.190
he took the biggest prize of his life,

124
00:06:54.220 --> 00:06:56.620
which we'll talk about a bit later for now.

125
00:06:56.620 --> 00:06:59.800
We see him and his crew sailing off the coast of Africa,

126
00:06:59.920 --> 00:07:01.110
whether or not every committed,

127
00:07:01.130 --> 00:07:04.270
any acts of piracy during this trip is yet another onset. And the points,

128
00:07:04.480 --> 00:07:07.990
according to a general history of pirates written in 1724,

129
00:07:07.991 --> 00:07:10.330
by the mysterious captain, Charles Johnson,

130
00:07:10.540 --> 00:07:14.830
Henry every did not take any praises into reaching that a gasket that he

131
00:07:14.831 --> 00:07:18.730
encountered two pirates snoops that quickly ran a grounds when they saw him as

132
00:07:19.050 --> 00:07:20.830
that crew scrambled to hide in the woods,

133
00:07:20.831 --> 00:07:24.490
believing that the fridge was still sailing under the British crown and was that

134
00:07:24.491 --> 00:07:27.010
to take them down every sense on arms messengers,

135
00:07:27.011 --> 00:07:30.700
to talk to the pirates and even volunteered to join them himself in order to

136
00:07:30.701 --> 00:07:34.030
convince them that his ship was no longer flying the British flag.

137
00:07:34.120 --> 00:07:36.670
Eventually once they were assured that he was telling the truth,

138
00:07:36.850 --> 00:07:41.290
the other privates gleefully joined every is now with the frigate on their side,

139
00:07:41.440 --> 00:07:44.470
they could take down much more valuable prizes as forever.

140
00:07:44.650 --> 00:07:47.470
He had only been a pirate captain for a few weeks,

141
00:07:47.590 --> 00:07:50.560
but was already building up a nice fleet for himself. Again,

142
00:07:50.590 --> 00:07:52.480
all of this is according to Johnson.

143
00:07:52.510 --> 00:07:55.690
And as we already discussed in our biographics video out black bids,

144
00:07:55.691 --> 00:07:57.400
you might want to check that one out. If you miss.

145
00:07:57.401 --> 00:08:00.220
This is identity is such a big question, Mark,

146
00:08:00.221 --> 00:08:03.760
that we can't even say with certainty, that he was a real person,

147
00:08:03.790 --> 00:08:06.400
pretty much everything he wrote comes under scrutiny.

148
00:08:06.430 --> 00:08:11.170
But unfortunately it is also one of the main sources for figures from the golden

149
00:08:11.171 --> 00:08:15.430
age of piracy. Other sources say that every was far more active as a pirate,

150
00:08:15.431 --> 00:08:18.940
right from the stops allegedly his first prize was in fact,

151
00:08:19.000 --> 00:08:21.760
a triple three English merchant ships that he captured a mayor.

152
00:08:21.761 --> 00:08:25.090
One of the islands that formed the Cape Verde archipelago near the Northwest

153
00:08:25.091 --> 00:08:27.340
coast of Africa. He continued onto Madagascar,

154
00:08:27.370 --> 00:08:28.930
but took several more prizes on his way,

155
00:08:28.931 --> 00:08:31.660
including two Dutch privateers and a French pirate ship,

156
00:08:31.690 --> 00:08:34.570
which yielded dozens of men who were willing to join his crew

157
00:08:40.780 --> 00:08:44.590
In 1695, Henry every set his sights on a very ambitious targets,

158
00:08:44.620 --> 00:08:46.180
perhaps the most ambitious,

159
00:08:46.210 --> 00:08:49.690
but also the most rewarding targets sailing the Indian ocean,

160
00:08:49.780 --> 00:08:52.420
the grands Moogle fleet during the 17th century.

161
00:08:52.421 --> 00:08:55.800
Most of the Indian subcontinent meaning most of India itself,

162
00:08:55.830 --> 00:08:58.710
plus parts of Pakistan, Afghanistan, and Bangladesh.

163
00:08:58.860 --> 00:09:03.360
What parts of the Moogle empire and every time this land was ruled by emperor

164
00:09:04.110 --> 00:09:07.770
Aurangzeb every year, the empire formed a fleet to escort Muslim worshipers,

165
00:09:07.920 --> 00:09:11.610
who went on the pilgrimage to Mecca cool. The Hodge in 1695,

166
00:09:11.611 --> 00:09:16.020
that convoy consisted of 25 ships, but they were not just carrying pilgrims.

167
00:09:16.050 --> 00:09:19.260
They also included merchant ships that were filled to the brim with gold and

168
00:09:19.261 --> 00:09:20.460
other treasures among them.

169
00:09:20.490 --> 00:09:25.290
The biggest prize of the flotilla was the Gange ease Salwa meaning exceeding

170
00:09:25.291 --> 00:09:28.680
treasure. That's also Anglicised as the gun's way.

171
00:09:28.740 --> 00:09:31.380
It was the time of Indian trading ship go to ganja Dow.

172
00:09:31.380 --> 00:09:36.360
And in September it left the port of mocca and was returning to Surat in India.

173
00:09:36.390 --> 00:09:39.120
How exactly every new of the dates, when the fleet left port,

174
00:09:39.150 --> 00:09:43.080
we're not sure maybe he got a tip or maybe it was widely available information

175
00:09:43.081 --> 00:09:45.210
since it was an annual pilgrimage, either way.

176
00:09:45.270 --> 00:09:47.640
He realized that even just one of the merchant ships,

177
00:09:47.641 --> 00:09:51.240
which make for the biggest prize of his life, but he couldn't do it alone.

178
00:09:51.300 --> 00:09:53.400
Not only were the merchant vessels armed,

179
00:09:53.790 --> 00:09:57.450
they also had washer past scored since they were traveling in dangerous waters,

180
00:09:57.840 --> 00:10:01.410
no every needed help. And he got it from five other pirate captains.

181
00:10:01.530 --> 00:10:03.000
You all wanted in on the action.

182
00:10:03.120 --> 00:10:06.390
They would tell them as to you who sailed aboard the Amity Thomas wake,

183
00:10:06.540 --> 00:10:09.870
who captain the Susanna Joseph Pharaoh on the Portsmouth adventure.

184
00:10:09.990 --> 00:10:13.890
Richard wants on the dolphin and Willy amaze about the pole. Realistically,

185
00:10:13.891 --> 00:10:17.670
apart from every only Thomas two was already a notable pirate in his own, right?

186
00:10:17.850 --> 00:10:20.220
The others ones that have been challenged of their flu tiller is the most

187
00:10:20.221 --> 00:10:23.280
experienced captain, but every eventually won out,

188
00:10:23.310 --> 00:10:27.530
mainly because he had the biggest and most powerful ship in August, 1695,

189
00:10:27.531 --> 00:10:31.640
the pirates met at the Bab El Mendez straits. This connects the red seeds,

190
00:10:31.641 --> 00:10:34.970
the Gulf of Aden and waited for the grands Moodle fleet to pass through.

191
00:10:35.180 --> 00:10:37.850
It is actually unclear if every ends,

192
00:10:37.851 --> 00:10:41.330
the other captains have met each other previously and agreed to convene here,

193
00:10:41.510 --> 00:10:45.680
or if they all simply showed up at the same time with the same intentions and

194
00:10:45.681 --> 00:10:49.070
decided that six ships were better than one, either way in September,

195
00:10:49.071 --> 00:10:52.970
the Bruegel convoy pass through these waters and the pirate scape chase.

196
00:10:53.060 --> 00:10:56.960
When the Moogle shifts saw the pirates, they began dispersing the Ganges wide.

197
00:10:56.990 --> 00:10:59.390
There's the biggest ship in the fleet immediately fell behind.

198
00:10:59.650 --> 00:11:02.900
Desert did its act score to the smaller part hammer Hamot even.

199
00:11:02.901 --> 00:11:04.460
So it became clear quite soon,

200
00:11:04.461 --> 00:11:07.640
but some of the pirate ships were ill fitted to this ambitious rate.

201
00:11:07.730 --> 00:11:11.570
The dolphin proved almost useless immediately as it was too slow to keep up with

202
00:11:11.571 --> 00:11:12.410
the rest of the ships.

203
00:11:12.560 --> 00:11:16.070
Eventually most of them had abandoned ship and joined every on the fancy

204
00:11:16.220 --> 00:11:19.760
meanwhile, Thomas to you and the Amity engaged in a fight through the fascia and

205
00:11:20.300 --> 00:11:23.120
Mohammad's, which had disastrous consequences for the pirates too,

206
00:11:23.121 --> 00:11:26.930
was killed by Canon shops that allegedly a giant hole through his stomach,

207
00:11:26.990 --> 00:11:30.320
horrified the rest of his men immediately surrendered and gave up the chase.

208
00:11:30.380 --> 00:11:30.831
Lastly,

209
00:11:30.831 --> 00:11:34.190
the Susanna also struggled to maintain the speed of the other vessels and was

210
00:11:34.191 --> 00:11:37.460
only present at certain points of the raid, which lasted over a week.

211
00:11:37.520 --> 00:11:40.790
The first ship that ever eons the rest managed to catch up to it was the fatter

212
00:11:41.270 --> 00:11:44.270
Mohamad still damaged from its engagements, with the Amity,

213
00:11:44.390 --> 00:11:48.290
the mogul ship surrendered its alone contained enough plunder to make the rate

214
00:11:48.291 --> 00:11:49.040
of success.

215
00:11:49.040 --> 00:11:53.530
Every however was determined to get his hands on the Ganges to why a few days

216
00:11:53.531 --> 00:11:56.440
later on September the seventh, he managed to catch up to the trading ship.

217
00:11:56.770 --> 00:11:58.060
At that point only the fancy,

218
00:11:58.061 --> 00:12:01.450
the Portsmith adventure and the bowl were still combat worthy.

219
00:12:01.570 --> 00:12:05.980
On the other side of the Mongol vessel was armed with dozens of canons and 400

220
00:12:05.981 --> 00:12:08.710
rifleman. The odds appeared to be in the favor of the mogul ship,

221
00:12:08.740 --> 00:12:11.170
but every had no intention of backing down.

222
00:12:11.171 --> 00:12:13.660
Now the same cannot be said for Joseph far, a board,

223
00:12:13.661 --> 00:12:17.320
the Portsmouth adventure who decided not to engage fortunately forever.

224
00:12:17.340 --> 00:12:19.330
He also had luck on his side during the fight.

225
00:12:19.360 --> 00:12:23.110
One of his first cannon volleys destroyed the Ganges wise main mass leaving the

226
00:12:23.410 --> 00:12:26.560
vessel slow and vulnerable. More importantly though, one of the Mughal ships,

227
00:12:26.980 --> 00:12:29.470
cannons, malfunctioned and exploded killing its gunners,

228
00:12:29.500 --> 00:12:32.440
setting the deck on fire and causing a lot of panic and confusion.

229
00:12:32.470 --> 00:12:36.520
The pirates seized the opportunity to open fire from all sides afterward,

230
00:12:36.530 --> 00:12:40.360
successfully boarding the Ganges swine overpowering the crew from an Indian

231
00:12:40.361 --> 00:12:41.950
perspective, contemporary historian,

232
00:12:41.951 --> 00:12:46.420
caffeine con blamed the defeat on the captain of the Ganges to why Muhammad

233
00:12:46.480 --> 00:12:50.350
Abraham, besides his incompetency also acted cowardly at one point,

234
00:12:50.351 --> 00:12:54.550
allegedly running below decks on these slave girls and telling them to fight for

235
00:12:54.551 --> 00:12:55.210
him.

236
00:12:55.210 --> 00:12:58.870
Colin also reported that what followed was far more gruesome than the flight

237
00:12:58.871 --> 00:13:00.970
itself, as the pirates, subjected the people, the board,

238
00:13:00.971 --> 00:13:02.980
the Mughal ship days of torture, rape,

239
00:13:03.160 --> 00:13:07.060
and murder with many of them committing suicide by jumping overboard to escape

240
00:13:07.061 --> 00:13:09.340
the horrifying act off two days of barbarity,

241
00:13:09.341 --> 00:13:11.830
the pirates were ready to leave with their spoils.

242
00:13:11.860 --> 00:13:14.260
The exact value of dilute is difficult to estimate,

243
00:13:14.290 --> 00:13:18.970
but it was somewhere between 325,000 pounds and 600,000 pounds.

244
00:13:19.120 --> 00:13:21.820
Plus another 50,000 pounds from the fascia and Muhammad.

245
00:13:22.090 --> 00:13:26.350
This would mean over a hundred million dollars in modern currency. But again,

246
00:13:26.620 --> 00:13:27.970
that's just a rough estimate.

247
00:13:28.000 --> 00:13:32.020
The point is that one share represented more money than any sailor made in a

248
00:13:32.021 --> 00:13:34.900
lifetime and more than enough for them to retire.

249
00:13:35.020 --> 00:13:37.390
But we do arrive now at another contentious point,

250
00:13:37.600 --> 00:13:42.100
sharing the spoils who got what there were no participation trophies in

251
00:13:42.101 --> 00:13:42.820
piracy.

252
00:13:42.820 --> 00:13:46.570
Although six chips started out only the two that actually fought the gangee.

253
00:13:46.580 --> 00:13:48.610
So why we're entitled to any of its riches.

254
00:13:48.700 --> 00:13:52.000
We have one accounts of what happened again, courtesy of Charles Johnson.

255
00:13:52.030 --> 00:13:55.330
He said that every betrayed the other pirate ship and sailed away with the

256
00:13:55.331 --> 00:13:58.930
entire loot after convincing them that the safest place to store it was the

257
00:13:58.931 --> 00:14:01.330
cargo hold of the fancy once that was done.

258
00:14:01.331 --> 00:14:05.170
He and his crew simply deposited onto the cover of night. According to sources,

259
00:14:05.290 --> 00:14:08.920
there was a heated argument between the crews of the fantasy and the pole after

260
00:14:08.921 --> 00:14:12.340
the former accused the latter of trying to cheat them by clipping coins,

261
00:14:12.580 --> 00:14:15.490
as punishments, every confiscated, the treasure wrote to the bowl.

262
00:14:15.491 --> 00:14:20.050
And instead only provided them with a modest sum to cover supplies and repairs.

263
00:14:26.580 --> 00:14:27.100
<v 1>Once news.</v>

264
00:14:27.100 --> 00:14:29.080
<v 0>Want it to spread about the attack on the Ganges,</v>

265
00:14:29.120 --> 00:14:32.730
why to say that it caused a commotion would be the understatement of the

266
00:14:32.731 --> 00:14:33.240
century.

267
00:14:33.240 --> 00:14:37.170
And for orange Zeb flew into a rage once he learned about his treasure being

268
00:14:37.171 --> 00:14:41.100
stolen, but also about the farmer of the pilgrims returning from Mecca,

269
00:14:41.220 --> 00:14:44.640
he immediately placed the English and Surratt under arrest and closed down

270
00:14:44.641 --> 00:14:45.211
factories,

271
00:14:45.211 --> 00:14:48.480
which belonged to the East India company with the intention of completely

272
00:14:48.481 --> 00:14:50.220
severing trade ties with England.

273
00:14:50.250 --> 00:14:53.630
Eventually there a point in history when the East India company became the

274
00:14:53.631 --> 00:14:56.500
largest private company in the war Wells and at a private army,

275
00:14:56.530 --> 00:14:58.390
much larger than that Britain,

276
00:14:58.391 --> 00:15:01.930
which used to rule over India for a century that point, however,

277
00:15:01.960 --> 00:15:03.250
we're still 60 years away.

278
00:15:03.251 --> 00:15:05.830
So for now they were at the mercy of the Mughal emperor.

279
00:15:05.890 --> 00:15:08.830
They promised to cover all the financial losses caused by the rate.

280
00:15:09.070 --> 00:15:11.800
And they placed a 500 pound bounty on everybody's head,

281
00:15:11.950 --> 00:15:15.640
which was later double to a thousand pounds, which was unheard of at the time.

282
00:15:15.850 --> 00:15:19.120
It also came with a free pardon for any pirate you turned him in to,

283
00:15:19.121 --> 00:15:23.140
but it's simply Henry ever. He became the most wanted man on the planet.

284
00:15:23.290 --> 00:15:25.690
The pirates might've successfully planted the treasure,

285
00:15:25.720 --> 00:15:29.350
but getting away with it would be a whole new challenge entirely first off,

286
00:15:29.351 --> 00:15:31.570
they needed to decide where they would sail. Next.

287
00:15:31.600 --> 00:15:35.350
Initially they traveled to a French islands near Madagascar named Bobo,

288
00:15:35.440 --> 00:15:37.360
and which was a safe Haven for pirates.

289
00:15:37.510 --> 00:15:40.570
That is where they divvied up their loot and plans. Then next step,

290
00:15:40.600 --> 00:15:41.950
some of the men stayed on Bolden.

291
00:15:42.040 --> 00:15:45.190
Others left the crew and secured passage on different ships on their own.

292
00:15:45.460 --> 00:15:48.700
As for Henry every and the rest of the pirates, the board, the fancy,

293
00:15:48.820 --> 00:15:53.110
they decided that The Bahamas would be the safest place for them in March, 1696,

294
00:15:53.111 --> 00:15:54.700
the fantasy arrived in new Providence.

295
00:15:54.700 --> 00:15:58.690
The islands that contains the Bahama and capita lived in a cell that every

296
00:15:58.691 --> 00:15:59.524
adopted the name,

297
00:15:59.560 --> 00:16:03.190
Henry Bridgman and convinced the governors and Nicholas trots that they were

298
00:16:03.191 --> 00:16:06.130
unlicensed, slavers hiding from the East India company,

299
00:16:06.220 --> 00:16:07.870
accompanied by a generous bribe.

300
00:16:07.900 --> 00:16:10.720
The story was enough to secure the pirates safe Haven in the South.

301
00:16:10.750 --> 00:16:13.720
It probably didn't hurt that every ship was the most powerful vessel for

302
00:16:13.721 --> 00:16:14.471
hundreds of miles.

303
00:16:14.471 --> 00:16:18.130
So the governor had the choice to be the making a friend or an enemy, even.

304
00:16:18.131 --> 00:16:20.680
So when you're the target of the largest manhunt in the world,

305
00:16:20.681 --> 00:16:22.090
your cover will not last forever,

306
00:16:22.091 --> 00:16:26.200
especially when your wealth mostly consists of diamonds and foreign gold coins.

307
00:16:26.230 --> 00:16:29.530
Whenever his true identity was discovered, trot had no other choice,

308
00:16:29.531 --> 00:16:33.130
but to issue an arrest warrant for him to avoid making himself complicit in this

309
00:16:33.131 --> 00:16:34.660
escape, even. So the governor,

310
00:16:34.690 --> 00:16:37.900
clearly it was not a friend of the East India company or the British government,

311
00:16:38.080 --> 00:16:40.930
as he tipped off, every the ships were on the way to arrest him.

312
00:16:40.960 --> 00:16:45.070
The captain and most of his crew had time to escape with only a few men staying

313
00:16:45.071 --> 00:16:48.400
behind and getting captured. It seemed inevitable that everywhere Henry,

314
00:16:48.401 --> 00:16:51.280
every went to someone would discover his true identity.

315
00:16:51.370 --> 00:16:54.910
And yet he seemingly did the impossible Henry, every vanished,

316
00:16:55.090 --> 00:16:58.900
nobody knows what ultimately happened to him, his crew, his ship,

317
00:16:59.020 --> 00:17:03.460
or his treasure. Everything from this point on is pure hearsay and rudeness.

318
00:17:03.550 --> 00:17:05.500
Allegedly, they tried going to Jamaica,

319
00:17:05.530 --> 00:17:09.430
but the same thing happens as in the South from that the crew split into groups,

320
00:17:09.520 --> 00:17:11.230
some stayed behind in the Caribbean,

321
00:17:11.260 --> 00:17:14.890
most traveled to North America and the last group, which included every himself,

322
00:17:15.450 --> 00:17:17.230
returns to England under assumed names.

323
00:17:17.350 --> 00:17:19.990
The most complete account is given by Charles Johnson. Again,

324
00:17:20.050 --> 00:17:23.770
he said that Henry ever refis traveled to Boston intending to settle in the new

325
00:17:24.130 --> 00:17:27.220
world, but changed his mind. And later sail to Ireland from them.

326
00:17:27.220 --> 00:17:30.730
He needed a way of selling his ill-gotten gains without being discovered.

327
00:17:30.880 --> 00:17:33.220
He made an arrangement with some merchants in Bristol,

328
00:17:33.221 --> 00:17:36.010
but they ripped him off and stole most of his share of the treasure.

329
00:17:36.040 --> 00:17:38.980
Every couldn't do anything against them as they threatened to expose his true
