00:00:19.820 --> 00:00:20.910
In the year D eight,

6
00:00:21.070 --> 00:00:25.710
a D ne committed suicide ending not only his reign as emperor of Rome,

7
00:00:25.970 --> 00:00:29.910
but the reign of the ju Claude day and dynasty unsurprisingly,

8
00:00:29.911 --> 00:00:33.230
this plunged Rome into chaos as multiple factions,

9
00:00:33.231 --> 00:00:36.550
trying to fill the power vacuum created by the fall of Nero.

10
00:00:36.551 --> 00:00:40.510
Following this came a crisis known as the year of the fall emperors,

11
00:00:40.511 --> 00:00:42.220
which as you might guess,

12
00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:46.580
or four different men seize the throne in the span of less than a year.

13
00:00:46.690 --> 00:00:49.180
<v 2>Once the dust had settled and the turmoil had ended.</v>

14
00:00:49.570 --> 00:00:54.380
Rome had a new emperor Sian who started his own Flavian dynasty.

15
00:00:55.100 --> 00:00:58.460
Sian was instrumental in bringing some much needed stability back to the Rome

16
00:00:58.620 --> 00:00:59.200
and em empire.

17
00:00:59.200 --> 00:01:03.970
His reign was mostly peaceful and focus on restoring Rome's infrastructure and

18
00:01:03.971 --> 00:01:04.590
economy.

19
00:01:04.590 --> 00:01:09.170
He also undertook ambitious building projects as parts of the city were still in

20
00:01:09.171 --> 00:01:13.090
shambles following the great fire of 64 ad during Nero's time.

21
00:01:13.240 --> 00:01:16.650
Some of his more notable building projects included the temple of peace.

22
00:01:16.790 --> 00:01:18.730
And of course the FLA and ahea,

23
00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:23.600
which became the most iconic landmark of the Roman bar that are known today as

24
00:01:23.601 --> 00:01:24.434
the Coliseum.

25
00:01:30.620 --> 00:01:33.520
<v 0>In the lives of the Caesars ancient historian.</v>

26
00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:37.680
Suton provided us with information regarding veian early years,

27
00:01:37.681 --> 00:01:39.400
according to him, the future, em,

28
00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:44.310
embryo was born Titus FLAS Vespasian on November the 17th nine

29
00:01:44.790 --> 00:01:49.750
ad in the Edna region of Italy in a village called fall Cranney whose exact

30
00:01:49.751 --> 00:01:54.590
whereabouts are unknown today by all accounts, Sian came from humble beginnings.

31
00:01:55.310 --> 00:01:59.910
Suetonius describes the Flavian house as obscure and without family portraits.

32
00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:02.990
Yet one that the country has no reason to be a,

33
00:02:03.740 --> 00:02:06.620
the first flan of note was veian paternal grandfather,

34
00:02:07.300 --> 00:02:11.060
Titus FLAS Petro who fought as a Centurian for Pompe.

35
00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:15.900
The battle of falis against Julius Caesar. After his side, lost the war,

36
00:02:16.070 --> 00:02:19.140
Petro obtained a full pardon and became a tax collector.

37
00:02:19.240 --> 00:02:22.460
His son Sabinas followed in his father's footsteps and became something.

38
00:02:22.760 --> 00:02:23.970
No one would think possible.

39
00:02:24.530 --> 00:02:28.490
A beloved tax collector suton says that there were cities in Asia,

40
00:02:28.540 --> 00:02:33.170
which erected statues in his honor with the inscription to an honest tax

41
00:02:33.210 --> 00:02:37.330
gatherer, Sabina, married Vasia poll, and their two children together.

42
00:02:38.050 --> 00:02:42.210
Sabinas the younger and Vasia Vasia actually came from a more prominent family.

43
00:02:42.470 --> 00:02:45.560
As her father was a military tree. Her brother was a Senator.

44
00:02:45.710 --> 00:02:49.960
Therefore her sons had an easier time rising up the racks for a long time.

45
00:02:50.060 --> 00:02:54.320
It seems that older brother Sabinas would be the one destined for great things.

46
00:02:54.620 --> 00:02:58.240
He was ambitious from an early age and eventually became pre fact of Rome.

47
00:02:58.760 --> 00:03:03.120
PAC on the other hands did not show much interest in politics and only joined

48
00:03:03.180 --> 00:03:07.440
due to his mother's constant torts that otherwise he would become his brother's

49
00:03:07.441 --> 00:03:10.800
footman. In subsequent years, SPAC married, Flavia DOMA,

50
00:03:10.960 --> 00:03:14.920
till who Bo him two sons and a daughter, Titus Domitian and Dilla.

51
00:03:14.921 --> 00:03:18.040
The younger while both sons would eventually reign his Rome,

52
00:03:18.360 --> 00:03:22.510
em Fe's wife and daughter passed away before he ascended to the throne

53
00:03:28.810 --> 00:03:32.590
In order to become a trait Sian first had to serve in the military.

54
00:03:32.770 --> 00:03:34.270
And as a minor magistrate,

55
00:03:34.410 --> 00:03:37.870
he started off as a Tribune of the soldiers assigned to race.

56
00:03:37.970 --> 00:03:42.900
During the reign Claudia Vespasian was appointed legate thanks to the influence

57
00:03:42.960 --> 00:03:43.980
of narcissists.

58
00:03:44.090 --> 00:03:47.660
This is not the mythological hunter who fell in love with his own reflection,

59
00:03:47.661 --> 00:03:52.580
but rather a freed man who was part of the Imperial court Vasan was given

60
00:03:52.581 --> 00:03:56.780
command of his own Legion. Legio second or Augusta and stationed in Germany.

61
00:03:56.970 --> 00:03:59.220
This promotion was a double edge sword though,

62
00:03:59.530 --> 00:04:01.610
while Sian climbed up the social ranks,

63
00:04:01.611 --> 00:04:06.250
he also became an enemy of Aina Claudia's wife who hated narcissists

64
00:04:06.470 --> 00:04:10.970
and all of his friends, Sian was first made console. Then governor of Africa,

65
00:04:11.310 --> 00:04:14.930
ProCon Laris re province on the Northern coast of Africa,

66
00:04:15.230 --> 00:04:17.930
the quality of his governorship is up for some debate,

67
00:04:18.450 --> 00:04:20.480
although he did not go into de details,

68
00:04:20.630 --> 00:04:25.080
Tacitus described it as notorious and hated in his histories.

69
00:04:25.140 --> 00:04:28.960
And he compared it unfavorably to that of his predecessor vitals,

70
00:04:28.980 --> 00:04:31.480
who was honest and populars. However,

71
00:04:31.960 --> 00:04:35.080
said the VPAC in governed with great justice and high honor,

72
00:04:35.400 --> 00:04:38.520
although even he specified that the governor once said to deal with a riot where

73
00:04:38.521 --> 00:04:40.320
people pelted him with turnips.

74
00:04:40.550 --> 00:04:44.190
There was one odd thing about PAC's governorship though.

75
00:04:44.510 --> 00:04:45.710
It almost bankrupted him.

76
00:04:46.070 --> 00:04:49.150
Normally governors used their positions to make as much money as possible

77
00:04:49.151 --> 00:04:51.830
through extortion or receiving bribes.

78
00:04:51.890 --> 00:04:55.350
It was almost expected of them as the governorship served as a reward,

79
00:04:55.351 --> 00:04:59.470
typically given either to friends of the Amper or acts consoles who fought well

80
00:04:59.490 --> 00:05:01.940
in military campaigns, but AIAN, however,

81
00:05:02.190 --> 00:05:04.940
chose to secure friendships and favors over money.

82
00:05:04.960 --> 00:05:07.460
And at one point he found himself almost broke.

83
00:05:08.300 --> 00:05:11.500
Suetonius wrote that he was forced to mortgage all of his estates to his brother

84
00:05:11.820 --> 00:05:14.180
and took up the mule trade to win back. Some of his fortune,

85
00:05:14.530 --> 00:05:15.660
thus ending the nickname.

86
00:05:15.920 --> 00:05:20.620
The mule tear Sian career is a civil servants ended somewhat ignominiously

87
00:05:20.630 --> 00:05:22.290
after Claudia came narrow.

88
00:05:22.770 --> 00:05:25.450
And although the space was originally part of his rat,

89
00:05:25.910 --> 00:05:27.650
he quickly lost the emperors favor.

90
00:05:27.950 --> 00:05:32.810
He greatly offended Nero by repeatedly falling asleep or walking out during

91
00:05:32.811 --> 00:05:34.130
his musical performances.

92
00:05:35.050 --> 00:05:37.730
Besian was eventually kicked out of the emperors in a circle,

93
00:05:38.210 --> 00:05:42.840
ands began avoiding all public appearances altogether fearing the ne rose

94
00:05:43.320 --> 00:05:46.720
wrath might go further than simply banishing him from his Imperial court

95
00:05:52.860 --> 00:05:56.960
As a military man Vasia distinguished himself in two major campaigns. First,

96
00:05:57.060 --> 00:06:02.040
he took part in the Roman invasion of Britain in 43 ad under general Les

97
00:06:02.360 --> 00:06:03.440
plot. At this time,

98
00:06:03.500 --> 00:06:07.880
the space was still a legate in commands of the Legio Augusta.

99
00:06:07.940 --> 00:06:12.440
His brother Sabina was also part of the invading force, although his exact rank,

100
00:06:12.720 --> 00:06:14.680
his somewhat uncertain during this campaign,

101
00:06:15.160 --> 00:06:20.030
ston said that Vespasian engaged in 30 battles and subdued two powerful tribes.

102
00:06:20.210 --> 00:06:24.470
He captured over 20 towns and also conquered the island AVEs known today as the

103
00:06:24.590 --> 00:06:28.470
island of white for success. He was awarded a Roman triumph back home in Romans.

104
00:06:28.471 --> 00:06:32.950
Eventually his console ship Sian played an even more instrumental role in his

105
00:06:32.951 --> 00:06:34.070
second military campaign.

106
00:06:34.220 --> 00:06:38.620
When he was tasked with putting down the great revolt Roman province of Judea

107
00:06:38.840 --> 00:06:43.180
and what would become the first Jewish Roman war. It started in 66 80.

108
00:06:43.360 --> 00:06:48.020
The people of Judea were angry over taxes exacerbated by increasing tensions

109
00:06:48.021 --> 00:06:52.580
between the Roman and Jewish population in man ill advised attempts to exert his

110
00:06:52.581 --> 00:06:54.420
dominance. The Roman governor gays,

111
00:06:54.600 --> 00:06:59.290
Floris decided to plunderer the second temple on the temple mounds in Jerusalem,

112
00:06:59.390 --> 00:07:01.850
as well as order raids on Jews throughout the city.

113
00:07:02.330 --> 00:07:06.050
This said the opposite of fact and proved to be the spark that triggered a large

114
00:07:06.370 --> 00:07:09.970
scale rebellion. The leg age of the nearby province of Syria Seus.

115
00:07:10.450 --> 00:07:14.170
GARS assembled his army and marched on Judea to que the rebellion. He however,

116
00:07:14.171 --> 00:07:16.570
suffered a shocking defeat and died in 67,

117
00:07:16.650 --> 00:07:21.160
a D ne of the mission of ending the great revolt to veian.

118
00:07:21.310 --> 00:07:25.240
This was two decades after his incursions into Britain. By this point,

119
00:07:25.260 --> 00:07:29.120
his oldest son ti had also joined the ranks of the military and bolstered his

120
00:07:29.121 --> 00:07:31.960
father's forces with reinforcements from Alexandria,

121
00:07:31.961 --> 00:07:33.520
serving as his second in command,

122
00:07:33.860 --> 00:07:38.320
not sharing his predecessors hubris Vespasian did not want to simply rush in

123
00:07:38.480 --> 00:07:39.670
Nick expecting victory.

124
00:07:39.810 --> 00:07:44.270
He avoided a direct attack on Jerusalem since the city was reinforced and

125
00:07:44.340 --> 00:07:45.870
contained the main rebel army.

126
00:07:46.020 --> 00:07:50.910
Instead he first invaded Galilee with a strong army of over 60,000 soldiers

127
00:07:50.930 --> 00:07:54.390
and auxiliaries. First paent had little trouble conquering the region.

128
00:07:54.690 --> 00:07:56.710
As many towns gave up without a fight.

129
00:07:57.070 --> 00:08:02.020
A particular note is the sea of yacht fat or jota patter that took

130
00:08:02.021 --> 00:08:06.820
place in the summer of 67, a D the Romans took the city after 47 days.

131
00:08:07.080 --> 00:08:09.700
The leader of the Jewish forces was yo Ben,

132
00:08:10.140 --> 00:08:14.740
Matt Yahu who became better known as Jaus one of the most important Jewish

133
00:08:14.741 --> 00:08:15.860
historians of the era.

134
00:08:16.340 --> 00:08:21.170
The Basian kept Jaus in his re as a slave slash interpreter eventually

135
00:08:21.171 --> 00:08:24.890
granting him his freedom and Roman citizenship. When he became emperor.

136
00:08:25.250 --> 00:08:27.250
Joyce wrote the war of the Jews,

137
00:08:27.330 --> 00:08:31.370
a Chronicle of the revolt that gave detailed accounts of several battles.

138
00:08:31.371 --> 00:08:35.570
According to him, PAC initially wanted to send him to narrow after the siege,

139
00:08:35.571 --> 00:08:39.890
but Josephus persuaded the general to keep him for himself by convincing the

140
00:08:39.891 --> 00:08:44.520
Roman that divine prophecy ordained that Sian will become emperor of Romes

141
00:08:44.870 --> 00:08:49.040
also made reference to this prognostication and also mentioned multiple other

142
00:08:49.210 --> 00:08:53.040
omens, which allegedly showed that Sian would one day rule Rome.

143
00:08:53.240 --> 00:08:56.920
Speaking of which that exact opportunity presented itself in 69 80,

144
00:08:57.140 --> 00:08:59.000
the Jewish war was not over yet,

145
00:08:59.060 --> 00:09:03.720
but Sian had seize the moment he left his son in charge of the troops in Juda,

146
00:09:04.400 --> 00:09:08.640
Titus favored a more direct approach and decided to lay siege on the city of

147
00:09:08.710 --> 00:09:09.543
Jerusalem.

148
00:09:09.570 --> 00:09:13.240
Titus was aided by the same people he was trying to defeat that was inviting

149
00:09:13.241 --> 00:09:17.190
between the leaders of the rev or forces known as the zealots, two of them,

150
00:09:17.430 --> 00:09:22.390
John of Gahar and Simon Bargo vibe for control and splinter their faction

151
00:09:22.391 --> 00:09:24.310
from within it took over four months,

152
00:09:24.410 --> 00:09:28.630
but TIS managed to break down the walls of Jerusalem and storm the city almost

153
00:09:28.631 --> 00:09:30.750
burning it completely to the ground. Now,

154
00:09:30.751 --> 00:09:33.430
just before we get into the bit about how PAC becomes Emper,

155
00:09:33.510 --> 00:09:36.660
I want to tell you about today's fantastic sponsor brilliance.

156
00:09:36.840 --> 00:09:40.060
So it's the holidays. We're all busy plans to arrange gifts,

157
00:09:40.061 --> 00:09:43.780
to give it's a little bit last minute now, probably places to go as well.

158
00:09:43.960 --> 00:09:47.580
But with today's sponsor brilliance, you can give the gift of learning.

159
00:09:47.980 --> 00:09:51.940
I bet there is someone you know, who enjoys learning as much as you do,

160
00:09:51.960 --> 00:09:55.020
and a subscription to brilliant could make a perfect gift for them.

161
00:09:55.021 --> 00:09:57.890
You've heard me talk about brilliance on this channel before by now,

162
00:09:57.891 --> 00:10:01.290
maybe even have a membership yourself, brilliant, teach you all about math,

163
00:10:01.291 --> 00:10:03.290
science, and computer science. But beyond that,

164
00:10:03.291 --> 00:10:06.330
they also teach you problem solving skills, which are practical.

165
00:10:06.600 --> 00:10:08.850
Even if you don't pursue the sciences,

166
00:10:09.290 --> 00:10:11.810
learning how to break down complex problems into their component.

uh, let's get back to it

174
00:10:41.250 --> 00:10:45.510
In order to get a good picture of IANS Ascension to the throne and the impact it

175
00:10:45.511 --> 00:10:46.590
had on Roman history.

176
00:10:46.770 --> 00:10:49.870
We must understand the turbulent times that came before it,

177
00:10:49.871 --> 00:10:53.790
that threatened to bring down the empire itself in the year 65 80,

178
00:10:53.930 --> 00:10:58.060
the PI Inan conspiracy attempted to get rid of narrow and restore the Roman

179
00:10:58.380 --> 00:11:03.140
Republic. It failed and resulted in dozens of executions, suicides,

180
00:11:03.141 --> 00:11:07.340
and exiles as near Rore increasingly paranoid about the people around him.

181
00:11:07.580 --> 00:11:08.413
A couple of years later,

182
00:11:08.820 --> 00:11:13.340
governor GAAS Julius index from Goul rebelled against Nero and marched with an

183
00:11:13.341 --> 00:11:17.810
army to depose the emperor and replace him with another governor named a,

184
00:11:18.030 --> 00:11:18.930
he also failed,

185
00:11:18.990 --> 00:11:22.850
but support for Nero was an all time low from the army and the nobleman.

186
00:11:23.210 --> 00:11:25.850
Although he remained popular with the people in 68,

187
00:11:25.910 --> 00:11:30.570
the Pretorian guard was persuaded by preve and amphibious subpoenas to abandon

188
00:11:31.170 --> 00:11:33.290
Nero and switch its allegiance to Garba.

189
00:11:33.810 --> 00:11:36.890
Nero was tried in Ceia and condemned to death as a public enemy.

190
00:11:37.280 --> 00:11:38.600
When word reach de emperor,

191
00:11:38.620 --> 00:11:41.440
he decided it would be better if he died by his own hands.

192
00:11:41.700 --> 00:11:46.160
So neuro committed suicide, thus ending the first Imperial dynasty of Rome,

193
00:11:46.640 --> 00:11:49.360
Tom oil erupted immediately as amphibious had a change of heart.

194
00:11:49.380 --> 00:11:52.880
And instead of supporting GABA, he wanted the throne for himself.

195
00:11:53.220 --> 00:11:56.040
As it turned out, he wasn't nearly as popular as he thought he was.

196
00:11:56.220 --> 00:12:00.440
The soldiers were reluctant to portray Garba and after an inspiring speech by

197
00:12:00.600 --> 00:12:02.400
military Tribune and Tous AARA,

198
00:12:02.750 --> 00:12:07.680
they unequivocally rejected amph video's plan and cut him down with their swords

199
00:12:07.681 --> 00:12:09.560
and then dragged his body through the city.

200
00:12:10.400 --> 00:12:13.070
GABA didn't stay in everyone's good graces long though,

201
00:12:13.130 --> 00:12:16.990
he became em in June 68 ad in January of the following year,

202
00:12:16.991 --> 00:12:19.790
he had already lost the support of the soldiers and the nobleman.

203
00:12:19.790 --> 00:12:23.710
This was mostly because he didn't reward those loyal to him and he failed to

204
00:12:23.711 --> 00:12:26.910
keep promises made by him more an amphibious on his behalf.

205
00:12:27.150 --> 00:12:31.390
Moreover GABA also canceled all of the reforms of Nero and adopted a young

206
00:12:31.391 --> 00:12:34.220
nobleman named Lucius per PSO,

207
00:12:35.380 --> 00:12:38.420
as his successor of offending, other more prominent statesmen,

208
00:12:38.421 --> 00:12:42.380
who felt like they deserved that honor among these statesman was Marcus Salus

209
00:12:42.620 --> 00:12:43.040
author.

210
00:12:43.040 --> 00:12:47.220
He had the influence to sway the Senate to his son and the money to bribe the

211
00:12:47.740 --> 00:12:51.380
Pretorian God on January the 15th, the God assassinated Garba PSO,

212
00:12:51.381 --> 00:12:56.010
and a few close associates and placed their heads on Spears and brought them to

213
00:12:56.290 --> 00:12:58.410
Aho who became the new Emper according to plea tar,

214
00:12:58.650 --> 00:13:01.890
although only a few Pretorian were involved in the killings, hundreds,

215
00:13:01.891 --> 00:13:06.130
others piled the bodies on the ground and smeared their hands and swords with

216
00:13:06.131 --> 00:13:06.750
their blood.

217
00:13:06.750 --> 00:13:11.490
As a show of loyalty to Arthur author's reign lasted a whopping three months at

218
00:13:11.491 --> 00:13:13.690
the same time that he made a claims of the Thrones.

219
00:13:13.690 --> 00:13:18.200
So did another man named Fatus. However, the latter was in Germany at the time.

220
00:13:18.300 --> 00:13:21.360
So it took him longer to gather his forces and March on Rome.

221
00:13:22.200 --> 00:13:25.520
Fatus had been put in charge of the Roman army and the province of Germania

222
00:13:25.840 --> 00:13:29.200
inferior, and he quickly injured himself to his soldiers. In fact,

223
00:13:29.201 --> 00:13:33.160
he was so popular that his troops refused to swear allegiance to Gar and instead

224
00:13:33.161 --> 00:13:37.110
proclaimed fat para. By the time his forces actually reached Italy,

225
00:13:37.670 --> 00:13:41.790
GABA was dead and a was the new ruler. The two met at the battle OFR come on,

226
00:13:41.880 --> 00:13:43.550
April the 14th, 69 80,

227
00:13:43.551 --> 00:13:47.590
which resulted in a decisive victory for vitals after his defeat author

228
00:13:47.620 --> 00:13:48.830
committed suicide.

229
00:13:49.210 --> 00:13:52.630
Tacito actually gives author quite a noble death saying that the emperor killed

230
00:13:52.631 --> 00:13:55.300
himself to avoid plunging Rome and to civil war.

231
00:13:55.620 --> 00:13:59.180
This historian writes that although delivered an impassioned speech saying that

232
00:13:59.240 --> 00:14:02.500
his life was not worth so many of rooms, young men,

233
00:14:02.610 --> 00:14:04.660
such Nobel armies to be again,

234
00:14:04.840 --> 00:14:09.180
cut down and lost the state that all those funeral tacit mentions that some

235
00:14:09.181 --> 00:14:12.660
soldiers followed their emperor's example and committed suicide near the PI.

236
00:14:12.760 --> 00:14:16.330
And that the practice was repeated at other Miller tree camps.

237
00:14:22.850 --> 00:14:26.290
Vitals became emperor on April the 16th, 69 ad. And so,

238
00:14:26.370 --> 00:14:27.850
although he reigned until the end of the year,

239
00:14:27.990 --> 00:14:30.490
he lost the support of his Countryman. Long before that,

240
00:14:30.930 --> 00:14:34.770
he was also a decadent ruler who according to Casius D was addicted to luxury

241
00:14:35.230 --> 00:14:38.600
and life. He gorged himself on rare, expensive foods,

242
00:14:38.601 --> 00:14:40.680
holding banquets multiple times a day.

243
00:14:41.080 --> 00:14:46.040
I regarded nearest T golden house or DOMA Suria as a wretched house that

244
00:14:46.041 --> 00:14:48.600
was scantily equipped and he wanted something a bit more opulence,

245
00:14:48.620 --> 00:14:49.520
unsurprisingly,

246
00:14:49.580 --> 00:14:54.040
his Kell spending soon put great strain on Rome's economy and led to fatals

247
00:14:54.041 --> 00:14:58.360
losing a lot of supporters. IANS rise to the throne, echoed that of fats.

248
00:14:58.460 --> 00:15:03.240
He also won over the legions in charge during the war in Judea ran in July 69

249
00:15:03.640 --> 00:15:05.600
ad. They acclaimed him as Emper moreover.

250
00:15:05.700 --> 00:15:09.480
He also had the support of the nearby provinces of Syria and Egyptian before

251
00:15:09.481 --> 00:15:12.510
long Sian had an army powerful enough to March on Rome.

252
00:15:12.690 --> 00:15:17.350
The soldiers were placed under the command of general Gaia Luin Messian the

253
00:15:17.351 --> 00:15:21.670
Syrian governor while Sian traveled to Egypt to secure the grain supply network

254
00:15:21.800 --> 00:15:23.270
vital to Rome. Meanwhile,

255
00:15:23.300 --> 00:15:27.510
even more allegiance from other provinces pledged their allegiance to PAC mostly

256
00:15:27.511 --> 00:15:31.620
because they served under author and bought strong resentment fats.

257
00:15:31.630 --> 00:15:36.340
These forces under the leadership of general Marcus cent PR did not even wait

258
00:15:36.440 --> 00:15:41.100
for Mac's army to count sharpens advanced on Italy on their owns

259
00:15:41.330 --> 00:15:44.860
suggested a different reason for their enthusiastic support of Sian.

260
00:15:44.861 --> 00:15:47.460
They originally left in order to aid author,

261
00:15:47.860 --> 00:15:50.420
and on the way did a fair bit of plunging and pillaging.

262
00:15:50.450 --> 00:15:52.450
When they found out a had fallen,

263
00:15:52.451 --> 00:15:56.010
they realized they would be punished severely unless they ended up on the

264
00:15:56.011 --> 00:15:59.130
winning team. So they threw their backing behind Sian.

265
00:15:59.230 --> 00:16:03.930
The troops met fats' forces at the seconds bat ofum on October the

266
00:16:03.931 --> 00:16:08.530
24th, 69 ad and where victorious defeated fats wanted to abate,

267
00:16:08.550 --> 00:16:12.920
but the Pretorian guard would not allow him to and instead made in retreat to

268
00:16:12.921 --> 00:16:13.760
the palace in Rome,

269
00:16:13.910 --> 00:16:18.080
back in the city Pretorian and civilians put up heavy resistance against AIAN

270
00:16:18.081 --> 00:16:21.680
forces and the battle inside Rome caused many deaths and a lot of destruction.

271
00:16:21.910 --> 00:16:24.160
Even the temple of Jupiter, optimist Maximus,

272
00:16:24.161 --> 00:16:28.360
the oldest most important temple in Rome was destroyed in an act described by

273
00:16:28.430 --> 00:16:33.270
Tacitus as the saddest and most shameful crime that the Roman eight had ever

274
00:16:33.271 --> 00:16:34.100
suffered.

275
00:16:34.100 --> 00:16:38.470
Persian's brother SBE was killed during the conflict and his youngest son to

276
00:16:38.830 --> 00:16:40.350
median barely escaped with his life.

277
00:16:40.750 --> 00:16:43.430
The show that Vitalis had lost complete control of his men,

278
00:16:43.700 --> 00:16:47.070
Tacitus mentioned how the more brought Sabina before the emperor ands,

279
00:16:47.100 --> 00:16:49.110
even though vitals wanted to show mercy,

280
00:16:49.370 --> 00:16:53.940
the blood thirsty hoard ran through sus with swords cut off his head and dragged

281
00:16:53.941 --> 00:16:55.460
his mutilated corpse through the streets.

282
00:16:55.820 --> 00:16:58.740
A similar F phase eventually fell vitals as well. Inevitably,

283
00:16:58.980 --> 00:17:02.300
the space forces gained control of the city and captured the emperor.

284
00:17:02.440 --> 00:17:07.140
He was taken to a notorious place of execution known as the Germanian stairs and

285
00:17:07.141 --> 00:17:11.340
struck down on December the 21st, the Senate proclaimed AIAN as the new emperor.

286
00:17:11.660 --> 00:17:16.410
Although some regard July 1st date was declared Ember back in Egypt as the start

287
00:17:16.411 --> 00:17:17.244
of his reign.

288
00:17:23.690 --> 00:17:27.770
VAPA was still in Alexandria when he heard of the death of Tellus and that he

289
00:17:27.771 --> 00:17:29.210
was now in charge of the Roman empire.

290
00:17:29.211 --> 00:17:33.770
Therefore mus handled the administration of the empire assisted by Domitian the

291
00:17:33.771 --> 00:17:35.600
two acted with complete authority.

292
00:17:35.660 --> 00:17:40.520
And even mics adds an Imperial seal given to him by Visian so that

293
00:17:40.521 --> 00:17:42.600
he may stamp official documents. At one point,

294
00:17:42.960 --> 00:17:46.440
the Sian sent Domitian tongue in cheek message saying, I thank you,

295
00:17:46.540 --> 00:17:48.320
my son for permitting me to hold office.

296
00:17:48.660 --> 00:17:52.360
And that you have not yet Deron me after a year of strife.

297
00:17:52.800 --> 00:17:56.600
Wared numerous expenditures. Macy's first concern was refilling Rome's Coff,

298
00:17:57.040 --> 00:17:59.840
the enacted new taxes and brought back old ones, a strategy,

299
00:17:59.841 --> 00:18:02.320
which was continued when the space in returned.

300
00:18:02.340 --> 00:18:06.320
And doubtedly the most memorable money making scheme enacted by the emperor was

301
00:18:06.480 --> 00:18:08.080
a urine tax in ancient Rome.

302
00:18:08.100 --> 00:18:12.430
It was the commodity prized for its hi amonia content used in laundry and

303
00:18:12.431 --> 00:18:16.790
tanning, and it was collected at public rhinos since year in was the basis for a

304
00:18:16.791 --> 00:18:19.990
successful trade. It felt natural for Visian to tax it.

305
00:18:20.100 --> 00:18:23.990
Some people found this practice incredibly distasteful, including his son,

306
00:18:24.160 --> 00:18:26.350
Titus who protested the idea to his father.

307
00:18:26.351 --> 00:18:30.580
According to sat fian picked up a coin and holding it to Titu.

308
00:18:30.820 --> 00:18:34.140
His nose asked him if he found the smell offensive, he said no.

309
00:18:34.360 --> 00:18:37.260
And as the emperor replied, yet, it comes from urine.

310
00:18:37.690 --> 00:18:41.060
This is regarded as the origin for the Latin phrase, Puna,

311
00:18:41.340 --> 00:18:43.620
non or money does not stink.

312
00:18:43.760 --> 00:18:46.660
It is also the reason why in many French speaking parts of the world,

313
00:18:46.940 --> 00:18:49.460
a public Urin is known as a Espi.

314
00:18:50.050 --> 00:18:53.210
The space reign was aided by a heavy propaganda campaign.

315
00:18:53.350 --> 00:18:55.450
He understood that starting a new dynasty,

316
00:18:55.451 --> 00:18:58.770
especially after a period of great instability was a tough task.

317
00:18:58.910 --> 00:19:03.690
And that many of his people still regarded him either as unproven or unworthy.

318
00:19:03.710 --> 00:19:05.610
He greatly encouraged that spread of stories,

319
00:19:05.611 --> 00:19:09.490
which mentioned prophecies and omens that he had been destined to become

320
00:19:09.730 --> 00:19:10.040
emperor.

321
00:19:10.040 --> 00:19:13.640
He made great use of writers and rewarded those who portrayed him in a positive

322
00:19:13.690 --> 00:19:17.600
light while punishing those who did not the stoic philosophers were frequent

323
00:19:17.710 --> 00:19:21.200
targets and were often arrested or had their works destroyed.

324
00:19:21.560 --> 00:19:25.920
At one point at the insistence of mus Sian, expelled them from Romo together.

325
00:19:26.060 --> 00:19:30.440
It should be noted that many ancient historians used as sources for VAPA, TAs,

326
00:19:30.550 --> 00:19:33.310
Joseph, and SATs, who were contemporaries of his.

327
00:19:33.420 --> 00:19:36.790
They wrote their accounts during the reigns of Sian or his sons,

328
00:19:36.791 --> 00:19:41.190
and were all rewarded in one form or another Cass's Dio who wrote his work a

329
00:19:41.191 --> 00:19:45.430
hundred years after the Flavian dynasty disappeared was more critical of Sian.

330
00:19:45.750 --> 00:19:47.390
Although he didn't disparage him greatly,

331
00:19:47.391 --> 00:19:52.180
either Dio was not afraid to mention some of his more repre hen act such as the

332
00:19:52.181 --> 00:19:56.460
persecution of the Stoics or the execution of the families of certain enemies,

333
00:19:56.610 --> 00:20:00.180
both he and Suetonius mentioned that Sian had been the target of multiple

334
00:20:00.181 --> 00:20:01.980
conspiracies, although they failed,

335
00:20:02.050 --> 00:20:05.940
they showed that the emperor was probably not as popular as he thought

336
00:20:12.770 --> 00:20:16.730
VAPA reign was mostly peaceful with the exception of the Beav and rebellion,

337
00:20:16.731 --> 00:20:18.290
which occurred at the beginning of his rule.

338
00:20:18.360 --> 00:20:22.530
Several tribes banded together in Gaul and Germany and rose up against the Roman

339
00:20:22.850 --> 00:20:23.070
em empire,

340
00:20:23.070 --> 00:20:27.130
hoping to take advantage of the turmoil caused by NE's death and the year of the

341
00:20:27.250 --> 00:20:31.130
four EMS. They were led by GA's Julius villas and Julius Sina.

342
00:20:31.430 --> 00:20:35.360
The latter aim to be a descendant Julius Caesar and therefore the rifle letter,

343
00:20:35.380 --> 00:20:36.213
the throne,

344
00:20:36.280 --> 00:20:39.840
although the rebels initially gave the Roman army multiple humiliating defeats

345
00:20:39.910 --> 00:20:44.840
Rome responded with a massive force led by Quinta Patels Sarius who crushed the

346
00:20:44.841 --> 00:20:49.480
uprising in 78 deep Bastian's long legacy is that of a builder when he

347
00:20:49.481 --> 00:20:50.360
ascended to the throne,

348
00:20:50.510 --> 00:20:54.200
many parts of Rome were ravaged due to the great far not to mention the urban

349
00:20:54.201 --> 00:20:56.800
battle between his soldiers and the supporters of Tellus.

350
00:20:56.860 --> 00:21:00.760
He rebuilt the temple of Jupiter using the same foundations that constructing a

351
00:21:00.761 --> 00:21:02.160
larger, more lavish structure.

352
00:21:02.300 --> 00:21:06.440
He undertook great efforts to restore 3000 or so bronze tablets that had been

353
00:21:06.510 --> 00:21:09.430
destroyed from the temple searching for copies throughout the empire.

354
00:21:09.480 --> 00:21:11.630
Other major works included two new temples,

355
00:21:11.690 --> 00:21:15.750
one dedicated to peace and the other to Claudias who had been terrified in order

356
00:21:15.810 --> 00:21:18.470
to restore many neighborhoods, veian enacted a new law,

357
00:21:18.471 --> 00:21:22.430
which allowed anyone to take over a vacant lot previously destroyed by the fire,

358
00:21:22.510 --> 00:21:26.310
provided that they built on it and that the original owner refused to do so.

359
00:21:26.870 --> 00:21:27.261
Of course,

360
00:21:27.261 --> 00:21:30.980
all of these projects pale in comparison to the new Flavian amphitheater,

361
00:21:31.340 --> 00:21:34.740
better known as the Coliseum capable of seating over 50,000 spectators,

362
00:21:35.040 --> 00:21:37.860
it was the largest structure of its kind in the ancient world.

363
00:21:37.900 --> 00:21:42.660
Construction of it began in 72 ad and finished during the reign of Titu with

364
00:21:43.140 --> 00:21:47.020
Domitian later ordering renovations during its time as emperor Verian died on

365
00:21:47.180 --> 00:21:49.930
June the 20 forth, 79 80 at the age of 69,

366
00:21:50.070 --> 00:21:53.090
his demise was something of a mixed bag on the one hands.

367
00:21:53.310 --> 00:21:56.810
He was only the second, em, embryo at that point to die of natural causes.

368
00:21:56.950 --> 00:22:00.890
The first being Augustus with all the others being assassinated or committing

369
00:22:00.920 --> 00:22:02.170
suicide. On the other hand,

370
00:22:02.270 --> 00:22:06.930
he did not have a dignified death S reported that fian fell Lincoln

371
00:22:07.450 --> 00:22:09.400
Pania tracked it. A bowel complaint.

372
00:22:09.700 --> 00:22:13.360
He was stricken with violent attacks of diarrhea that eventually killed him with

373
00:22:13.361 --> 00:22:14.240
his blast breaths.

374
00:22:14.630 --> 00:22:18.760
Sian asked his attendance to hold him up because an emperor ought to die

375
00:22:19.000 --> 00:22:21.840
standing. He was followed onto the throne by his son, Titus,

376
00:22:21.841 --> 00:22:23.120
and then by his other son,

377
00:22:23.560 --> 00:22:28.080
Domitian the Flavian dynasty ended with Dominion's death in 96 ad after only 25

378
00:22:28.081 --> 00:22:28.870
years,

379
00:22:28.870 --> 00:22:33.590
but projects like the Coliseum ensured that Vespas legacy lives on for

380
00:22:33.750 --> 00:22:36.550
millennia. So I really hope you found that video. Interesting. If you did,
