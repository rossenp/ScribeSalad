improve your stem skills while having a great time learning at

00:00:11.920 --> 00:00:13.240
brilliant.org/biographics more on them a bit.

5
00:00:19.460 --> 00:00:24.350
No one has been greater botanist zoologist. No one has written more books,

6
00:00:24.500 --> 00:00:28.150
more correctly, more methodically from personal experience.

7
00:00:28.610 --> 00:00:33.070
No one has more completely changed a whole science and started

8
00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:34.343
a new epoch.

9
00:00:34.600 --> 00:00:39.030
Those were the words used to describe Carl Lenas as written by,

10
00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:41.940
well, Carl Le, if nothing else,

11
00:00:41.941 --> 00:00:46.060
this man was certainly not shy about floundering his accomplishments,

12
00:00:46.280 --> 00:00:47.460
but he might not be wrong.

13
00:00:48.020 --> 00:00:51.340
Colon air studied botany his entire life and became one of the most prominent

14
00:00:51.450 --> 00:00:53.780
experts on the subject. A prolific writer.

15
00:00:53.920 --> 00:00:56.100
<v 1>He completely revolutionized taxonomy,</v>

16
00:00:56.101 --> 00:01:00.180
which is the science of naming and classifying biological organisms.

17
00:01:00.280 --> 00:01:03.730
He named and IED around 16,000 species.

18
00:01:04.150 --> 00:01:07.050
The Marky left on taxonomy is still obvious today.

19
00:01:07.390 --> 00:01:10.850
If you look up the scientific name of any of the plants he described,

20
00:01:10.980 --> 00:01:15.650
their author is so ubiquitous that he is de noted simply by the letter

21
00:01:16.050 --> 00:01:16.883
L.

22
00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:24.720
<v 0>Colones was born on may the 23rd,</v>

23
00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:30.080
1707 in rash to tiny village in the Southern province of small lands in Southern

24
00:01:30.081 --> 00:01:34.240
Sweden. He was the eldest of five children to Neil's Ingamar and Aire.

25
00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:36.240
And Christina brought a Sonya.

26
00:01:36.340 --> 00:01:40.240
His father was a church minister and an amateur botanist who believed in the

27
00:01:40.241 --> 00:01:43.430
importance of a good education. Ever since Carl was little boy,

28
00:01:43.450 --> 00:01:47.110
he and his father would take trips through the garden where Neils taught him

29
00:01:47.111 --> 00:01:49.790
everything that he knew about plants. By age five,

30
00:01:50.270 --> 00:01:52.670
Carl already had his own garden, even as a young child.

31
00:01:52.990 --> 00:01:55.670
And he enjoyed remembering the names of every plant.

32
00:01:55.950 --> 00:01:58.150
And we're not talking about their common names here,

33
00:01:58.250 --> 00:02:02.830
but the long complicated ones that are in Latin this however did not

34
00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:04.380
pressed his teachers at school.

35
00:02:05.060 --> 00:02:09.820
Botany was not considered a proper subject like mathematics or theology. Yet.

36
00:02:10.180 --> 00:02:14.300
Carl always prioritized his botanical studies over the other subjects because of

37
00:02:14.301 --> 00:02:15.620
this. He was always a middling student.

38
00:02:15.680 --> 00:02:19.380
He wasn't considered good enough for college by his educators. Fortunately,

39
00:02:19.550 --> 00:02:23.260
there was one exception, a teacher named Johan Rothman.

40
00:02:23.690 --> 00:02:27.930
I teaching he was also a medical doctor and recognized that Carl's passion for

41
00:02:27.990 --> 00:02:31.330
Barany could parlay very well into a career in medicine.

42
00:02:31.510 --> 00:02:34.690
He not only encouraged Nils to put his son on this path,

43
00:02:34.790 --> 00:02:39.690
but also took Carl to his home and tutored him and physiology and anatomy in

44
00:02:39.890 --> 00:02:40.611
1727,

45
00:02:40.611 --> 00:02:44.480
the 21 year old Aire enrolled at the university of London to study medicine.

46
00:02:44.580 --> 00:02:48.200
He did. So under his Latin name, carless Lena Monica.

47
00:02:48.500 --> 00:02:51.880
He also used on all the papers he wrote in Latin later on.

48
00:02:51.881 --> 00:02:55.000
He also adopted the name Carvan Lin after he became a noble,

49
00:02:55.060 --> 00:02:58.000
but we're still a few decades away from that happening.

50
00:02:58.800 --> 00:03:01.120
Lena's time at learned was brief after just a year,

51
00:03:01.180 --> 00:03:05.600
he transferred to ups university because he believed they had a better botany

52
00:03:05.601 --> 00:03:09.960
course, as it turns out, the exact opposite was true. The course was quite poor,

53
00:03:09.961 --> 00:03:13.800
but this actually worked in Carl's favor in just a short while he became one of

54
00:03:13.801 --> 00:03:16.960
the most knowledgeable people on botany in the entire university,

55
00:03:16.961 --> 00:03:18.910
teachers included in his set India.

56
00:03:18.930 --> 00:03:23.150
He wrote a paper on the reproduction of plants called pre Ludia sponsor.

57
00:03:24.300 --> 00:03:27.110
Plantarum it impressed one of the medical professors,

58
00:03:27.710 --> 00:03:31.350
Ola Rudberg to the points where he considered that linears should be teaching

59
00:03:31.610 --> 00:03:35.830
botany, not studying it. And so it was that just 23 years of age,

60
00:03:36.630 --> 00:03:39.980
carinas became a lecturer at one of the countries, Lee eating universities.

61
00:03:46.240 --> 00:03:49.740
It was during these early years of teaching that Cal airs began growing

62
00:03:49.780 --> 00:03:53.500
dissatisfied with the current system of plant classification and started

63
00:03:53.501 --> 00:03:56.660
thinking of ways to improve it. He also wrote several manuscripts,

64
00:03:56.661 --> 00:04:00.170
which would later become the groundwork for some of his most important work,

65
00:04:00.171 --> 00:04:03.970
such as critical Botanica. And Lanar however,

66
00:04:04.080 --> 00:04:07.450
getting them published required either having money or a reputation.

67
00:04:07.770 --> 00:04:10.650
And so at that point in time, Lyne had neither.

68
00:04:10.790 --> 00:04:14.170
So we waited for a more opportune time in 1732,

69
00:04:14.270 --> 00:04:16.130
the Royal society of sciences,

70
00:04:16.580 --> 00:04:21.240
Inana funded a research expedition for Aire to allow app lands the most

71
00:04:21.560 --> 00:04:23.360
Northern province of the country. By the way,

72
00:04:23.361 --> 00:04:26.920
this shouldn't be confused with the region of the same name today found in

73
00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:28.480
Finlands, which did not exist.

74
00:04:28.510 --> 00:04:32.600
Back then as the whole of Lapland was still part of the Swedish realm.

75
00:04:32.700 --> 00:04:37.000
The main goal of the expedition was to collect and document as many plants and

76
00:04:37.001 --> 00:04:39.720
animals as possible. In the hopes of finding new species,

77
00:04:39.980 --> 00:04:43.870
the trip would vomited a similar journey made by R back a few decades prior.

78
00:04:43.871 --> 00:04:47.830
Unfortunately for him, he had lost all the extensive notes in a fire.

79
00:04:48.230 --> 00:04:52.270
The air set off on may, the 12th, 1732 shortly before his 25th birthday.

80
00:04:52.650 --> 00:04:56.750
It took him almost half a year to make the 1,250 mile journey,

81
00:04:56.880 --> 00:05:00.990
which he traveled on foot. And by horse, even though lap lands was not,

82
00:05:01.260 --> 00:05:03.420
are considered a particularly biodiverse region.

83
00:05:03.840 --> 00:05:07.380
The young botanist still managed to find and collect around a hundred new plant

84
00:05:07.381 --> 00:05:11.540
species. His discoveries forms the basis for one of his most important books.

85
00:05:11.680 --> 00:05:15.300
The floral Ponca published in 1737 in Amsterdam.

86
00:05:15.301 --> 00:05:19.060
There was an account of all the plants that Lynes encountered during his trip

87
00:05:19.070 --> 00:05:21.930
describing over 500 species in D detail.

88
00:05:22.070 --> 00:05:24.210
The information in the book was significant,

89
00:05:24.390 --> 00:05:28.290
but what truly made it noteworthy was the fact that EZ put into practice for the

90
00:05:28.291 --> 00:05:31.450
first time, his new binomial nomenclature system,

91
00:05:31.451 --> 00:05:34.650
which had made him famous and is still in use in taxonomy today.

92
00:05:34.810 --> 00:05:39.010
Binomial nomenclature simply means a two term naming system with this method.

93
00:05:39.200 --> 00:05:42.720
Most species on the planet can be named using only two words.

94
00:05:42.910 --> 00:05:47.080
They are usually in Latin though. It has become common to use modern words,

95
00:05:47.081 --> 00:05:49.400
usually the names of people or places,

96
00:05:49.780 --> 00:05:53.360
and simply adapt them to the Latin grammatical form. The first words,

97
00:05:53.500 --> 00:05:56.160
the generic name designates the genus of the species,

98
00:05:56.420 --> 00:06:00.840
the genus being a higher category into which similar organisms can be grouped.

99
00:06:00.980 --> 00:06:02.800
The second term is the specific name,

100
00:06:02.801 --> 00:06:05.240
which is used to identify only that species.

101
00:06:05.740 --> 00:06:08.480
The methods was not only easy and practical,

102
00:06:08.660 --> 00:06:13.000
but it brought some much needed order to an area that was ruled by chaos.

103
00:06:13.480 --> 00:06:15.920
Taxonomy had been practiced since ancient times.

104
00:06:16.360 --> 00:06:19.630
BARR was one of the first to classify animals by shared attributes.

105
00:06:19.730 --> 00:06:22.790
The science continued during medieval times and the Renaissance,

106
00:06:22.930 --> 00:06:24.430
but it was incredibly confusing.

107
00:06:24.430 --> 00:06:28.070
Since many scientists like to use long descriptive terms to name species,

108
00:06:28.830 --> 00:06:32.510
there was also no international body to officially establish the name of

109
00:06:32.511 --> 00:06:33.170
species.

110
00:06:33.170 --> 00:06:37.660
So it was entirely possible for the same organism to be described multiple books

111
00:06:37.670 --> 00:06:41.580
under different names. The common Bri rose is a good example of this problem.

112
00:06:41.800 --> 00:06:44.220
In ER's time, he founded onto two different names.

113
00:06:44.440 --> 00:06:48.900
One of them was Rosa SVEs in Adora SU Canino and the other was Rosa

114
00:06:49.620 --> 00:06:51.900
Sylvestre, Alba rib folio GL.

115
00:06:52.090 --> 00:06:54.340
Besides the fact that both refer to the same plant,

116
00:06:54.341 --> 00:06:59.290
neither name is particularly easy to remember or say using Lanier's method.

117
00:06:59.510 --> 00:07:04.210
It simply became known as Rosa kina to give proper credit where it's due.

118
00:07:04.850 --> 00:07:08.370
Linaire was not the first one to use two words to name and classify plants,

119
00:07:08.690 --> 00:07:12.370
a Swiss bots named gas, barred Boin did it a hundred years before him,

120
00:07:12.371 --> 00:07:17.130
indeed Aire was aware of his work and even retains many names originally devised

121
00:07:17.230 --> 00:07:18.320
by bohi. However,

122
00:07:18.740 --> 00:07:22.600
the Swiss modernist never developed his idea into a system which he implemented

123
00:07:22.601 --> 00:07:27.440
universally Boin simply liked using as few words as possible while still

124
00:07:27.441 --> 00:07:30.440
ensuring that they were descriptive enough to identify a species.

125
00:07:30.750 --> 00:07:33.560
Sometimes two words were enough, but in other cases,

126
00:07:33.900 --> 00:07:36.400
he would use three or four or however many.

127
00:07:36.401 --> 00:07:39.150
He just felt were necessary using the line in system.

128
00:07:39.350 --> 00:07:41.590
The specific name did not have to describe the species.

129
00:07:42.000 --> 00:07:44.870
Oftentimes it was named after a person or a place,

130
00:07:44.871 --> 00:07:49.710
which meant that one word was enough to act as a unique identifier Lenas would

131
00:07:49.711 --> 00:07:53.750
go on to further improve and refine his system as did scientists who came after

132
00:07:53.810 --> 00:07:56.150
him. But this, it was good enough for now

133
00:08:02.310 --> 00:08:06.580
While writing floral Lea Lynes continued to teach courses at the university in

134
00:08:06.940 --> 00:08:10.820
Al technically though he was still a student and eventually he concluded that it

135
00:08:10.821 --> 00:08:13.780
might be time to actually graduate. Of course, by this time,

136
00:08:13.781 --> 00:08:17.740
given his knowledge and experience graduation was just a formality one,

137
00:08:17.870 --> 00:08:21.850
which he wants to get on with as far as possible. Therefore in 1735,

138
00:08:21.851 --> 00:08:23.170
he switched universities again.

139
00:08:23.400 --> 00:08:26.770
This time he traveled to the university of Hardwick in the Netherlands,

140
00:08:27.050 --> 00:08:29.130
as it had a reputation of awarding degrees quickly,

141
00:08:29.270 --> 00:08:32.810
one of the honest experiences of his life occurred on his way to the university.

142
00:08:32.990 --> 00:08:36.090
He stomp off in Hamburg, where he met a guest of the Bergham Meister,

143
00:08:36.091 --> 00:08:37.770
who was their equivalent of a mayor.

144
00:08:37.990 --> 00:08:42.360
The official wanted to show off an rare and valuable curiosity,

145
00:08:42.410 --> 00:08:45.840
which he had in his collection. It was a stuffed Hydra. Admittedly,

146
00:08:45.860 --> 00:08:49.800
it had been killed hundreds of years prior and diluted from a church since it

147
00:08:49.801 --> 00:08:51.200
came to be in the possession of the mayor.

148
00:08:51.380 --> 00:08:55.320
The Hamburg Hydra had stirred quite a bit of interest in Europe and the local

149
00:08:55.321 --> 00:08:59.320
politician was simply waiting for the end of a bidding war to see who offered

150
00:08:59.321 --> 00:09:02.680
the highest price for it. The NAS was not impressed with the oddity.

151
00:09:02.780 --> 00:09:06.240
He clearly saw it for what it was a fake made by gluing together,

152
00:09:06.241 --> 00:09:09.280
different animal parts and covering them in snake scales. However,

153
00:09:09.740 --> 00:09:14.440
he wasn't exactly tactful or diplomatic. It is debunking of the Hamburg Hydra.

154
00:09:14.810 --> 00:09:17.070
He made his observations public immediately.

155
00:09:17.071 --> 00:09:19.430
Also suggesting that since it came from a church,

156
00:09:19.570 --> 00:09:24.030
it was most likely done to resemble the biblical beast rather than the Hydra

157
00:09:24.031 --> 00:09:26.070
from Greek mythology. Unsurprisingly,

158
00:09:26.071 --> 00:09:29.790
the value of the stuffed creature went down the toilet and the mayor of Hamburg

159
00:09:30.000 --> 00:09:33.630
found that he could no longer sell it for a large sum of money feeling that he

160
00:09:33.631 --> 00:09:34.464
was no longer welcome.

161
00:09:34.830 --> 00:09:38.100
Leonard took his leave and made a swift getaway to Hamburg.

162
00:09:38.480 --> 00:09:41.900
The Swedish bar has derived in heart and got his diploma.

163
00:09:42.200 --> 00:09:44.500
He knew that he could graduate fast, but not even.

164
00:09:44.520 --> 00:09:46.620
He expected things to go as smoothly as they did.

165
00:09:47.100 --> 00:09:49.580
Len had already written a paper on the causes of malaria,

166
00:09:49.670 --> 00:09:51.580
which he submitted as his doctoral thesis.

167
00:09:51.880 --> 00:09:53.940
It was called inaugural thesis in medicine,

168
00:09:54.200 --> 00:09:58.330
in which a new hypothesis us on the cause of intermittent fevers is presented by

169
00:09:58.331 --> 00:09:59.164
the favor of God,

170
00:09:59.300 --> 00:10:04.210
three times the best and the greatest submitted by Karl Lena from small

171
00:10:04.230 --> 00:10:08.890
and Sweden, a Radian scholar in it, the Swedish scientist got some things right,

172
00:10:08.910 --> 00:10:13.450
and some things wrong Linea Aines that a common type of wormwood called Artesia

173
00:10:13.810 --> 00:10:15.850
Anur would work as a remedy against malaria.

174
00:10:16.310 --> 00:10:20.680
This was 240 years before Chinese research at two UU actually

175
00:10:20.710 --> 00:10:25.040
extracted a compound called art medicine from the plants and used it to

176
00:10:25.041 --> 00:10:27.400
successfully make antier drugs. However,

177
00:10:27.540 --> 00:10:31.240
he incorrectly concluded that malaria was caused by very small clay particles

178
00:10:31.270 --> 00:10:35.480
because all the regions with high instances of the illness had soil rich and

179
00:10:35.590 --> 00:10:39.030
clay either way. The university was sufficiently impressed with the thesis.

180
00:10:39.210 --> 00:10:42.390
And within two weeks, Carl Lenas became a doctor of medicine.

181
00:10:42.540 --> 00:10:46.190
Also around this time in the Netherlands, Lenas added another impressive,

182
00:10:46.210 --> 00:10:48.310
but unusual accolade to his resume.

183
00:10:48.570 --> 00:10:52.590
He became the first man to successfully grow a banana in Europe. Back then,

184
00:10:52.820 --> 00:10:54.950
this was a grand ambition of botanists.

185
00:10:55.020 --> 00:10:57.820
Many of them managed to get the banana plant to start growing,

186
00:10:58.040 --> 00:11:02.100
but none could make it flour, let alone produce its delicious fruit.

187
00:11:02.290 --> 00:11:05.900
This was because the plant preferred a hotter and wetter climate than what

188
00:11:05.901 --> 00:11:09.460
Europe could provide. Linaire didn't exactly figure this out right off the bat,

189
00:11:09.640 --> 00:11:12.740
but he adopted a scientific and methodical approach to the problem.

190
00:11:13.080 --> 00:11:14.420
He knew that through trial and error,

191
00:11:14.480 --> 00:11:17.220
he could achieve conditions which would help the Bon banana grow.

192
00:11:17.570 --> 00:11:19.170
Eventually he gave the plants enough,

193
00:11:19.220 --> 00:11:22.250
extra heat and water to mimic its natural tropical climate.

194
00:11:22.350 --> 00:11:26.370
And he was rewarded with a flowering plant full of tasty banana fruit,

195
00:11:26.460 --> 00:11:31.170
which from a botanical perspective is actually technically a buried during his

196
00:11:31.171 --> 00:11:32.004
experiments line,

197
00:11:32.140 --> 00:11:35.450
wrote down extensive notes and observations and until later published them.

198
00:11:35.451 --> 00:11:37.970
So there's anyone with even a modicum of horticultural skin.

199
00:11:38.200 --> 00:11:42.400
I could also recreate the conditions and grow their own bananas later on.

200
00:11:42.401 --> 00:11:46.080
He continued his studies and came up with multiple medical applications for the

201
00:11:46.081 --> 00:11:50.080
fruit, such as treating coughs, eye inflammations and bladder problems. Bizarre.

202
00:11:50.140 --> 00:11:53.280
He also became convinced that the banana was the forbidden fruit found in the

203
00:11:53.281 --> 00:11:56.120
garden of Eden, which was eaten by Adam and Eve.

204
00:11:56.380 --> 00:11:58.880
So you might not be discovering biblical fruits,

205
00:11:58.881 --> 00:12:02.680
but if you'd like to learn more about science while brilliant is the way to do

206
00:12:02.681 --> 00:12:02.801
it,

207
00:12:02.801 --> 00:12:06.360
brilliant is a problem solving based website and app with a hands on approach.

208
00:12:06.360 --> 00:12:09.960
They've got over 60 interactive courses in maths science and computer science.

209
00:12:10.300 --> 00:12:13.870
Now you've probably heard me talk about brilliant and what they really do is

210
00:12:13.871 --> 00:12:16.670
beyond teaching you the kind of maths and science and computer science.

211
00:12:16.671 --> 00:12:19.590
They really teach you problem solving skills, which are practical.

212
00:12:19.620 --> 00:12:22.710
Even if you don't pursue any of these sciences,

213
00:12:23.030 --> 00:12:24.590
learning how to break down complex problems.

214
00:12:24.750 --> 00:12:28.350
Do that component parts is kind of critical in whichever career path you chooses

215
00:12:28.450 --> 00:12:29.950
or maybe you've wanted to learn programming,

216
00:12:30.110 --> 00:12:31.750
but you've always been a bit daunted by as well.

217
00:12:32.110 --> 00:12:35.180
Normally it requires you on the tedious details of a specific programming

218
00:12:35.380 --> 00:12:35.520
language,

219
00:12:35.520 --> 00:12:39.460
but really the bedrock of it is an understanding of the fundamental algorithms

220
00:12:39.780 --> 00:12:43.180
on brilliant. You start by programming a drone with simple instructions,

221
00:12:43.240 --> 00:12:47.140
and this teaches you the basic structure of every program that you'll ever

222
00:12:47.141 --> 00:12:49.300
write. It's all drag and drop exercises,

223
00:12:49.301 --> 00:12:51.980
which will get you thinking like a computer scientist in no time.

224
00:12:52.160 --> 00:12:53.770
And that's just one example there.

225
00:12:53.930 --> 00:12:57.290
Load of great stuff on that platform look brilliant is a great compliments

226
00:12:57.490 --> 00:13:01.250
watching educational videos like this one it'll really help you master even

227
00:13:01.360 --> 00:13:02.890
complex technical subjects.

228
00:13:03.070 --> 00:13:07.210
So if you want to support biographics and get it unlimited access to all of

229
00:13:07.211 --> 00:13:10.250
brilliance, indepth, maths, and science courses, please head over to

231
00:13:14.801 --> 00:13:16.880
subscription. And let's get back to it

232
00:13:23.420 --> 00:13:24.560
In the Netherlands line,

233
00:13:24.940 --> 00:13:28.080
met and befriended several people who would play an important role in his

234
00:13:28.081 --> 00:13:31.840
career. One of them was a Dutch bots named ya Frederick Gros.

235
00:13:31.940 --> 00:13:36.550
He saw one of line's manuscripts where the sweet scientist used his new binomial

236
00:13:36.551 --> 00:13:40.630
nomenclature and realized that it had the potential to revolutionize botany.

237
00:13:41.150 --> 00:13:43.870
Grono encouraged Linaire to write and publish his ideas.

238
00:13:44.130 --> 00:13:47.950
Not only that he helped him do it by financing his work and convincing a friend

239
00:13:47.951 --> 00:13:51.670
of his Scottish doctor named Isaac Lawson to do the same Lyne,

240
00:13:51.671 --> 00:13:53.310
always intended to publish his works.

241
00:13:53.370 --> 00:13:55.500
It was just a matter of securing the money to do it.

242
00:13:55.570 --> 00:13:58.180
This new arrangement was just a match made in heaven.

243
00:13:58.560 --> 00:14:03.340
And so in 1735 COE published arguably his most important work,

244
00:14:03.560 --> 00:14:05.900
the system in Naura or the system of nature.

245
00:14:06.200 --> 00:14:10.940
It was a book on taxonomy highlighting his ideas on the hierarchy of all the

246
00:14:11.140 --> 00:14:14.620
organisms in the world, which of course used his own naming system.

247
00:14:14.650 --> 00:14:17.770
This book became a constant presence in ly NE's life.

248
00:14:17.970 --> 00:14:21.050
As he always kept revising and adding to it over the course of 30 years,

249
00:14:21.051 --> 00:14:25.370
he published 12 different editions of the book going from Amir 12 pages in his

250
00:14:25.371 --> 00:14:28.930
first edition to more than 2,400 pages for the last,

251
00:14:29.190 --> 00:14:32.210
it was the first attempt to name all the known organisms in the world.

252
00:14:32.510 --> 00:14:35.930
It was ambitious, but perhaps two ambitious at firstly,

253
00:14:36.200 --> 00:14:40.240
a believed that there could be hardly more than 10,000 species in the world.

254
00:14:40.420 --> 00:14:44.960
He eventually changed his tune when he realized that he could name around 7,700

255
00:14:44.990 --> 00:14:46.400
flowering plants alone,

256
00:14:47.000 --> 00:14:49.200
besides simply adding more species to the ever-growing list.

257
00:14:49.720 --> 00:14:51.080
EZ also improved the hierarchy.

258
00:14:51.340 --> 00:14:54.120
His taxonomic system had five levels from highest to lowest.

259
00:14:54.140 --> 00:14:56.760
It included kingdom class order, genus and species.

260
00:14:57.100 --> 00:15:00.880
He considered gen and species to be natural God-given categories.

261
00:15:01.200 --> 00:15:05.040
While the other three were human constructs developed to make classification

262
00:15:05.041 --> 00:15:05.874
easier.

263
00:15:06.040 --> 00:15:10.160
The NAS believed that all organisms in the world fell into one of three

264
00:15:10.510 --> 00:15:12.230
kingdoms, animals, plants,

265
00:15:12.530 --> 00:15:15.470
and minerals by the 10th edition of the systemic Artur,

266
00:15:15.600 --> 00:15:18.550
which is regarded by many as the definitive version.

267
00:15:19.550 --> 00:15:21.710
Lenas had divided the animal kingdom into six classes,

268
00:15:21.840 --> 00:15:24.350
which are mostly still recognizable today.

269
00:15:24.580 --> 00:15:28.390
They are mammalia which includes mammals AVEs comprised of birds.

270
00:15:28.790 --> 00:15:32.460
Amphibia containing amphibians and rep PIs comprising,

271
00:15:33.100 --> 00:15:37.620
bony fish in sector, which contained all arthropods and finally vers,

272
00:15:37.670 --> 00:15:41.420
which included all the invertebrates without exoskeletons and segmented bodies

273
00:15:41.610 --> 00:15:45.140
like worms and mosques plants were grouped into 24 classes. Now we,

274
00:15:45.141 --> 00:15:46.540
I going to go into detail for each one,

275
00:15:46.541 --> 00:15:50.700
but linear stress that his classifications were done purely for identification

276
00:15:50.820 --> 00:15:55.330
purposes. He did not regard them as natural groups, that kind of classification.

277
00:15:55.510 --> 00:15:57.010
He reserved for another book of his,

278
00:15:57.070 --> 00:16:01.410
the philia Botanica published in 1751 for the

279
00:16:01.411 --> 00:16:06.090
categorizations in the sustainment Artura line, relied on sexual reproduction,

280
00:16:06.450 --> 00:16:10.250
a group plant, mostly going by the number of statement, niche, plant hat.

281
00:16:10.510 --> 00:16:13.800
The statement by the way is the male fertilizing parts of the flower.

282
00:16:13.940 --> 00:16:16.040
The bit that produces pollen, the female organ,

283
00:16:16.041 --> 00:16:20.080
the one with the seed is called the pistol line's classification was quite

284
00:16:20.081 --> 00:16:23.320
basic. The class of flowers with one statement was called men Andria.

285
00:16:23.340 --> 00:16:25.720
The class with two statements was di Andria.

286
00:16:25.740 --> 00:16:28.720
The one with three was tri Andria and well. So on,

287
00:16:28.721 --> 00:16:31.000
there were exceptions of course, such as crypto Gaia,

288
00:16:31.001 --> 00:16:35.790
which included all Thurs fungi and Algee Len's mineral division was

289
00:16:35.850 --> 00:16:38.110
far more basic and has fallen completely out of use.

290
00:16:38.250 --> 00:16:39.910
He grouped them into just three classes.

291
00:16:40.480 --> 00:16:44.790
Petre for rocks mineraly for minerals and facia for fossils and sediments.

292
00:16:44.970 --> 00:16:45.470
Of course,

293
00:16:45.470 --> 00:16:49.150
taxonomy has advanced since the days of ness there aren't just five main

294
00:16:49.151 --> 00:16:52.950
taxonomic ranks anymore. For example, there are eight, but even in his own,

295
00:16:53.300 --> 00:16:53.480
in time,

296
00:16:53.480 --> 00:16:57.540
the scientist seemed always willing to admit his mistakes and make changes,

297
00:16:57.541 --> 00:17:02.300
which is one of the main reasons why this ISTE Naura has so many additions in

298
00:17:02.301 --> 00:17:05.380
the first books. He classified whales as Phish. For example,

299
00:17:05.610 --> 00:17:09.660
even the thing that made him famous by nom nomenclature Aire submitted that

300
00:17:09.661 --> 00:17:11.300
sometimes it was not enough.

301
00:17:11.320 --> 00:17:16.130
So he all introduced trinomial or Tris the dog. For example,

302
00:17:16.230 --> 00:17:19.050
he considered a subspecies of the wool for Canus lupus.

303
00:17:19.051 --> 00:17:22.850
Therefore the domestic dog needed a sub specific name to distinguish it.

304
00:17:22.870 --> 00:17:27.770
So he named it Canus lupus familiars a more well known example is the

305
00:17:27.790 --> 00:17:30.530
Plains bison subspecies of the American bison.

306
00:17:30.531 --> 00:17:34.440
Also known as the Buffalo because the genus and subspecies all had the word

307
00:17:34.570 --> 00:17:39.200
bison in them. Lynes gave them the scientific name of bison, bison bison.

308
00:17:39.560 --> 00:17:43.760
A similar example is the Western lowland gorilla who has the Ryman gorilla

309
00:17:43.761 --> 00:17:44.594
gorilla gorilla.

310
00:17:44.700 --> 00:17:49.040
But that one wasn't named by the NAS one final interesting little tidbit from

311
00:17:49.180 --> 00:17:51.000
the URA concerns,

312
00:17:51.100 --> 00:17:55.440
the common simples war or to give it its Lyne name cigs be

313
00:17:55.990 --> 00:18:00.760
Orta Lyne ran into conflict with Johan cigs back an academic who considered the

314
00:18:00.761 --> 00:18:05.440
modernist idea of sexual reproduction to classify plants as loathsome hollow,

315
00:18:05.670 --> 00:18:10.470
because God would never have allowed such D and behavior referring here to all

316
00:18:10.471 --> 00:18:14.710
plants that had more than one male and one female reproductive organ as revenge,

317
00:18:15.430 --> 00:18:17.590
Lenas named the small and ugly weed after him

318
00:18:23.690 --> 00:18:25.590
During his time spent in the Netherlands.

319
00:18:26.230 --> 00:18:29.660
Lenas also made the acquaintance of George cliff at thei arch banker,

320
00:18:29.920 --> 00:18:33.420
who as one of the directors of the Dutch east India company was one of the

321
00:18:33.421 --> 00:18:35.980
wealthiest men in the country. More than that though, Clifford,

322
00:18:36.140 --> 00:18:40.140
she Aire passion for botany. He owned a large estate called heart cap,

323
00:18:40.141 --> 00:18:42.260
which was famous for its massive gardens.

324
00:18:42.380 --> 00:18:44.660
Clifford Toon Aire says his personal physician.

325
00:18:44.840 --> 00:18:48.380
The Swedish doctor was provided with a generous salary, free room and board.

326
00:18:48.400 --> 00:18:51.810
And of course, acts nest to one of the most diverse gardens in Europe.

327
00:18:52.030 --> 00:18:53.850
His work was not particularly taxing.

328
00:18:53.851 --> 00:18:57.530
So Lyne spent most of his time indulging in his botanical interests.

329
00:18:57.750 --> 00:19:02.210
He even wrote a book called Jes cliff Tianas describing over 1,200 plant species

330
00:19:02.320 --> 00:19:03.650
that were found in Harter camp.

331
00:19:03.651 --> 00:19:07.130
There's actually a pretty funny story of Halle came to work for Clifford.

332
00:19:07.140 --> 00:19:07.830
Prior to that,

333
00:19:07.830 --> 00:19:12.640
he was employed by a fellow botanist named Johanas Berman who also allowed Lyne

334
00:19:12.641 --> 00:19:14.440
to stay with him. When Clifford made his offer,

335
00:19:14.460 --> 00:19:18.160
the Swedish scientist was reluctant to accept as he already promised Berman to

336
00:19:18.161 --> 00:19:18.994
stay with him for the winter.

337
00:19:19.360 --> 00:19:21.920
His part Berman was keen to keep his prize assistant.

338
00:19:21.990 --> 00:19:25.880
Cliffords had tempting with a red book from his collection and he persuaded

339
00:19:26.200 --> 00:19:29.720
Berman to trade Aire for the book during his time with Clifford Lyne also made

340
00:19:29.721 --> 00:19:31.230
trips to France and England there.

341
00:19:31.231 --> 00:19:35.590
He befriended other notable botanists and exchanged ideas, but more importantly,

342
00:19:35.591 --> 00:19:37.710
he also showed them his new naming system,

343
00:19:37.711 --> 00:19:41.070
which many of them adopted over the following years in 1738,

344
00:19:41.550 --> 00:19:44.790
Linaire finally returned to Sweden. He married a woman named Sarah Elizabeth,

345
00:19:45.230 --> 00:19:46.830
Maria, and they had seven children together.

346
00:19:46.930 --> 00:19:50.470
He then moved to Stockholm where he found work as a physician while there

347
00:19:50.870 --> 00:19:54.740
Linaire also founded the Royal Swedish academy of science and became its first

348
00:19:54.741 --> 00:19:58.540
president. His stint in Stockholm was short. As three years later,

349
00:19:58.720 --> 00:20:02.380
he moved to Abala where he became professor of botany in medicine at the

350
00:20:02.381 --> 00:20:05.300
university that he once tended. He was still young at this time,

351
00:20:05.540 --> 00:20:08.380
only in his mid thirties, but he'd already settled into a nice groove,

352
00:20:08.381 --> 00:20:10.140
which he maintained for the rest of his life.

353
00:20:10.240 --> 00:20:13.490
He continued teaching and some more importantly writing by the end of his

354
00:20:13.491 --> 00:20:15.530
career, the nurse had published over 30 books,

355
00:20:15.710 --> 00:20:19.690
not counting the different editions of sustain and NA in 1750,

356
00:20:19.830 --> 00:20:22.250
he became the rector of Al university.

357
00:20:22.510 --> 00:20:26.170
The nurse regularly took his students and botanical expeditions through the most

358
00:20:26.171 --> 00:20:28.850
remote parts of Sweden often that the government's expense,

359
00:20:29.330 --> 00:20:33.680
his most prized peoples became known as the apostles of Lynas because they went

360
00:20:33.681 --> 00:20:37.720
on expeditions throughout the entire world to spread his teachings as well as

361
00:20:37.721 --> 00:20:40.200
collect rare samples to bring back to the university.

362
00:20:40.520 --> 00:20:42.720
Carl Peter Thunberg traveled to Japan. For example,

363
00:20:42.810 --> 00:20:45.240
while Peter calm was the one who visited north America,

364
00:20:45.241 --> 00:20:49.640
perhaps his most notable apostle was Daniel Soer who accompanied James Cook on

365
00:20:49.641 --> 00:20:51.720
his first journey to Australia for his work.

366
00:20:52.200 --> 00:20:55.040
Lyne was Knight in 1761 by king AOL Frederick.

367
00:20:55.250 --> 00:20:58.920
Since then he took on the name CARV onlin. In his later years,

368
00:20:59.020 --> 00:21:00.960
he found up solo who crowded and noisy.

369
00:21:00.961 --> 00:21:04.640
So he purchased an estate called Hammarby in the nearby countryside.

370
00:21:04.641 --> 00:21:08.150
Eventually he had to resign as university ragged at you to his failing health.

371
00:21:08.450 --> 00:21:12.590
He suffered three strokes in five years and the last one finally killed him on

372
00:21:12.591 --> 00:21:16.790
January the 10th, 1778, age 70, his vast collections,

373
00:21:16.791 --> 00:21:19.510
which included tens of thousands of plants and insects.

374
00:21:19.511 --> 00:21:23.710
Plus thousands of books and letters were left to his family who later sold it to

375
00:21:23.711 --> 00:21:27.540
a young English botanist named James Edward Smith upon his written and London,

376
00:21:27.680 --> 00:21:30.100
the wealthy scientist foundered, the linen society,

377
00:21:30.101 --> 00:21:34.860
helping to ensure that the name linears will always be an ex linked

378
00:21:35.000 --> 00:21:38.140
to the world of natural history and taxonomy.

379
