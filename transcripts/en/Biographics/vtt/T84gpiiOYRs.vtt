1
00:00:00.240 --> 00:00:03.660
<v 0>They might be more famous Outlaws out there who rooms the wild West,</v>

2
00:00:03.690 --> 00:00:07.560
but few of them, if any, with deadlier, the John Wesley Hardin,

3
00:00:07.770 --> 00:00:10.040
he brags about gunning down over 40 men.

4
00:00:10.080 --> 00:00:14.130
Although newspapers of the time were only able to corroborate around 25 victims

5
00:00:14.310 --> 00:00:18.150
even. So this is still a lot more than other notorious gunman of the time,

6
00:00:18.160 --> 00:00:20.160
such as Billy, the kids, Jesse James,

7
00:00:20.161 --> 00:00:24.690
or wild bill Hickok harden branded himself, the deadliest killer of them all.

8
00:00:24.700 --> 00:00:26.430
But as you were about to find out,

9
00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:29.730
he was also a man who was a little more interested in creating an image for

10
00:00:29.731 --> 00:00:33.030
himself. Then speaking the truth, there are many claims he made,

11
00:00:33.031 --> 00:00:37.050
which at this point are simply impossible to corroborate fully like the time he

12
00:00:37.051 --> 00:00:40.290
killed a man for just snoring too loudly. But at the same time,

13
00:00:40.291 --> 00:00:43.860
he said for most other figures of the wild West and most of the figures on this

14
00:00:43.861 --> 00:00:47.070
channel, in fact, when you become famous and enough time passes,

15
00:00:47.071 --> 00:00:51.090
the truth always gets mixed in with a bit of exaggeration and legend.

16
00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:55.350
So we will do our best as we bring you the violence and bloody story of the

17
00:00:55.920 --> 00:00:57.330
outlaw John Wesley hall.

18
00:01:09.890 --> 00:01:10.530
<v 1>Right?</v>

19
00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:13.340
<v 0>So we should point out that a lot of the details surrounding Hodan,</v>

20
00:01:13.370 --> 00:01:14.750
particularly his early life,

21
00:01:14.900 --> 00:01:18.440
come to us straight from the man himself and are completely unsubstantiated by

22
00:01:18.441 --> 00:01:19.370
any other sources.

23
00:01:19.730 --> 00:01:23.300
He actually wrote an autobiography in prison titled the life of John Wesley

24
00:01:23.301 --> 00:01:25.820
Hardin, which was published in 1896,

25
00:01:25.821 --> 00:01:29.140
shortly after his death Hardin was born on may the 26th,

26
00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:31.160
1953 in bond and Texas,

27
00:01:31.161 --> 00:01:35.150
the son of a Methodist preacher named James harden and his wife,

28
00:01:35.210 --> 00:01:36.170
Elizabeth Dixon.

29
00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:39.680
They did a lot of traveling throughout the state when harden was a young boy

30
00:01:39.710 --> 00:01:41.390
because his father was a circuit rider,

31
00:01:41.420 --> 00:01:45.440
meaning that he was an itinerant clergyman who traveled from one settlement to

32
00:01:45.441 --> 00:01:47.300
another to organize congregations.

33
00:01:47.360 --> 00:01:50.480
Eventually the family settled down in Sumpter, Trinity County,

34
00:01:50.720 --> 00:01:54.710
where James harden served as a teacher until the outbreak of the civil war in

35
00:01:55.550 --> 00:01:57.410
1861, according to his son's autobiography,

36
00:01:57.411 --> 00:02:00.410
the senior harden immediately wanted to join the Confederate army,

37
00:02:00.411 --> 00:02:04.250
but was convinced to stay behind as he would be more useful in his hometown

38
00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:07.160
housing himself had wanted to go off fighting Yankees,

39
00:02:07.161 --> 00:02:08.900
although he was only nine at the time,

40
00:02:08.901 --> 00:02:11.060
and even made a plan with his older brother, Joe,

41
00:02:11.061 --> 00:02:13.130
to run away and join the Confederacy. However,

42
00:02:13.131 --> 00:02:16.550
that master plan was foiled when their father found out about it and beat them

43
00:02:16.551 --> 00:02:18.320
until they came to their senses,

44
00:02:18.380 --> 00:02:21.650
the civil war had a serious impact on the development of a young harden.

45
00:02:21.710 --> 00:02:25.430
He became a typical Confederacy supporter who considered slavery.

46
00:02:25.431 --> 00:02:28.580
The white man's writings represented all minorities,

47
00:02:28.850 --> 00:02:30.080
but particularly black people.

48
00:02:30.290 --> 00:02:34.010
There was only a few more years until John Wesley Hardin first showed off his

49
00:02:34.011 --> 00:02:36.740
extremely violent nature in 1867,

50
00:02:36.741 --> 00:02:39.950
the 14 year old heart and got into a fight with another boy called Charles

51
00:02:40.520 --> 00:02:42.200
slaughter and both drew their knives,

52
00:02:42.650 --> 00:02:45.410
pardoned stabbed the other boy twice and nitty Kilton. He claimed this.

53
00:02:45.411 --> 00:02:49.280
He acted in self-defense and presumably convinced the school's officials.

54
00:02:49.281 --> 00:02:53.630
If this fact is he avoided any serious consequences while salsa might've avoided

55
00:02:54.110 --> 00:02:57.650
Hardin's facial wrath. It was only a year later that the future outlook guilt,

56
00:02:57.800 --> 00:03:02.230
his first man, a former slave named MEJ. Again, according to harden,

57
00:03:02.231 --> 00:03:05.710
this was also self-defense, which is a recurring theme in his autobiography.

58
00:03:05.711 --> 00:03:07.720
As he constantly portrays himself,

59
00:03:07.750 --> 00:03:11.710
either as a victim or someone completely justified in his actions,

60
00:03:11.770 --> 00:03:16.000
as he succinctly put it, the people that he killed needed killing harden,

61
00:03:16.001 --> 00:03:18.820
and his cousin got into a wrestling match with the form of slave.

62
00:03:18.850 --> 00:03:23.230
The two boys won while hot and even drew blood from MEJ something which enraged

63
00:03:23.231 --> 00:03:26.620
him to the point of wanting to shoot out the 15 year old heart and was not one

64
00:03:26.621 --> 00:03:29.320
to back down. So he went home to retrieve a gun,

65
00:03:29.350 --> 00:03:32.980
but his uncle got wind of what he intended to do and kept them in the house.

66
00:03:33.010 --> 00:03:35.920
The next day harden was out riding when he met with major, again,

67
00:03:36.190 --> 00:03:40.840
still fills with Von and rage that latter ran into the road and grabbed Hardin's

68
00:03:40.841 --> 00:03:44.140
horse by the bridle that's which point it's the former pulls out a Colt 40

69
00:03:44.500 --> 00:03:45.790
foreign shop made four times.

70
00:03:52.320 --> 00:03:52.590
<v 2>[Inaudible].</v>

71
00:03:52.590 --> 00:03:56.070
<v 0>Only a few days later and hardened saw himself forced to go on the run again in</v>

72
00:03:56.071 --> 00:03:59.130
his own version of events, haunting painted himself as the victim.

73
00:03:59.131 --> 00:04:02.640
One who would have never received proper justice from the courts as they became

74
00:04:02.641 --> 00:04:06.990
filled with Northern bureaucrats and agents and other veterans,

75
00:04:07.020 --> 00:04:11.520
enemies of the South harden had the same buser loading and prejudice for union

76
00:04:11.521 --> 00:04:12.120
soldiers.

77
00:04:12.120 --> 00:04:16.050
This he did for minorities while it's feasible that his first few violent

78
00:04:16.051 --> 00:04:17.700
encounters could have been self-defense.

79
00:04:17.701 --> 00:04:22.230
The third one made it clear that John Wesley Hardin was a cold blooded murderer,

80
00:04:22.710 --> 00:04:23.543
plain and simple.

81
00:04:23.610 --> 00:04:27.120
Soon off to the death of major an arrest warrant was issued for Hardin's arrest.

82
00:04:27.900 --> 00:04:31.530
Thirties got a tip on where he was hiding and sent union soldiers to take him

83
00:04:31.531 --> 00:04:35.370
in. But the outlaw caught wind of the incoming posse from his brother, Joe,

84
00:04:35.371 --> 00:04:38.070
and waited for them in ambush as Arjun himself, put it.

85
00:04:38.070 --> 00:04:42.240
He had no mercy on men who he knew only wanted to get his body to torture and

86
00:04:42.241 --> 00:04:45.630
kill arms with a shotgun and to revolver Hardin waylaid,

87
00:04:45.631 --> 00:04:46.890
the three union soldiers,

88
00:04:46.920 --> 00:04:50.520
guns them all down and it's buried their bodies in the bed of a nearby Creek.

89
00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:55.020
John Wesley Hardin was still just 15 years old and had already killed four

90
00:04:55.021 --> 00:04:57.030
people. Once he was a fully fledged outlaw,

91
00:04:57.390 --> 00:05:00.390
haunting began quickly associating with other criminals throughout Navarro

92
00:05:00.420 --> 00:05:03.390
County, Texas. He rode with Frank Polk for a while,

93
00:05:03.391 --> 00:05:06.050
a gunman pursued by a detachment of soldiers,

94
00:05:06.330 --> 00:05:09.960
killing another man named Tom Brady. The soldiers managed to capture polic,

95
00:05:10.140 --> 00:05:13.600
but harden escapes their grasp. When he was hanging out with Jim Newman,

96
00:05:13.950 --> 00:05:14.371
nodding claims,

97
00:05:14.371 --> 00:05:17.670
he shot a man's eye out just to when a bottle of whiskey and of that.

98
00:05:17.790 --> 00:05:21.030
He played a road for a bit with a cousin of his named simp Dixon,

99
00:05:21.031 --> 00:05:23.040
who was a member of the KU Klux Klan.

100
00:05:23.070 --> 00:05:26.790
They also got into a shootout with some union soldiers and killed two more of

101
00:05:26.791 --> 00:05:27.900
them. In 1869.

102
00:05:27.990 --> 00:05:32.820
Dixon was later captured alone and executed by firing squad later that same year

103
00:05:33.150 --> 00:05:36.630
Hardin left Navarro County and roamed around taxes for a while as expected.

104
00:05:36.631 --> 00:05:40.200
The conflicts and confrontations kept coming one after another,

105
00:05:40.350 --> 00:05:44.340
oftentimes they turned to violence and sometimes even deadly Hardin claims to

106
00:05:44.341 --> 00:05:46.440
have guilt and other four men during this time,

107
00:05:46.441 --> 00:05:50.010
including a pimp and a circus performance in January, 1871,

108
00:05:50.430 --> 00:05:52.560
hardened stood accused of being involved in the murder of city.

109
00:05:53.100 --> 00:05:54.750
Marshall Labon John Hoffman of Waco,

110
00:05:54.751 --> 00:05:57.620
Texas Hoffman was sitting in a barbershop chair with his face,

111
00:05:57.920 --> 00:05:58.940
love waiting for a shave.

112
00:05:58.941 --> 00:06:01.790
When someone walks up behind him and shot him in the back of the head,

113
00:06:01.791 --> 00:06:05.480
killing him instantly the gunman then sped out of town on horseback hiding

114
00:06:05.481 --> 00:06:07.760
claims to be innocence in his autobiography.

115
00:06:07.910 --> 00:06:11.150
Of course his word means nothing but reports at that time,

116
00:06:11.151 --> 00:06:13.550
named him as an accomplice instead of the killer,

117
00:06:13.670 --> 00:06:17.150
while also mentioning another criminal named while George Thomason,

118
00:06:17.300 --> 00:06:20.840
who was apparently gunned down in a shootout with state police.

119
00:06:21.020 --> 00:06:24.860
So it is possible that Thomas was the shooter instead of harden. Anyway,

120
00:06:25.310 --> 00:06:27.140
harden was caught and arrested for a while.

121
00:06:27.141 --> 00:06:29.690
It seems like as outlaw days might've come to an end,

122
00:06:29.720 --> 00:06:32.690
but he still had a few tricks up his sleeve. For some reason,

123
00:06:32.720 --> 00:06:35.570
harden was not held in Waco while awaiting trial.

124
00:06:35.690 --> 00:06:38.780
Instead he was transferred to a small town called Marshall,

125
00:06:38.781 --> 00:06:42.260
where he was kept inside a log cabin and jailed somehow how to manage,

126
00:06:42.261 --> 00:06:44.450
to get his hands on a pistol from another prisoner,

127
00:06:44.510 --> 00:06:47.000
which he kept hidden by tying it with a string under his arm.

128
00:06:47.060 --> 00:06:48.950
He waited for the best opportunity to use it,

129
00:06:48.980 --> 00:06:52.190
which she got when he was being transferred back to Waco on the road,

130
00:06:52.191 --> 00:06:55.550
he was being escorted only by two state policemen, Edward steaks,

131
00:06:55.551 --> 00:06:56.390
and Jim smally.

132
00:06:56.540 --> 00:06:59.750
At one point steaks left to get wood for the fire part and retrieved has gone

133
00:06:59.751 --> 00:06:59.901
well,

134
00:06:59.901 --> 00:07:03.440
smally wasn't looking and killed him before making a run for it on his horse.

135
00:07:03.530 --> 00:07:04.363
Afterwards,

136
00:07:04.490 --> 00:07:08.250
harden hid out in Gonzalez County for a while with some cousins of his named

137
00:07:08.810 --> 00:07:10.550
Clements, he needed to get out of Texas.

138
00:07:10.551 --> 00:07:14.630
So his cousin suggested work as a cowboy driving cattle on the Chisolm trail

139
00:07:14.631 --> 00:07:18.110
between Texas and Kansas, of course, just because he needed to lay low,

140
00:07:18.111 --> 00:07:20.630
did not mean that and left behind his violent ways.

141
00:07:20.690 --> 00:07:23.330
He got into multiple gunfights with Mexican, for chiros,

142
00:07:23.331 --> 00:07:26.690
cattle rustlers and native Americans, which ended in fatalities.

143
00:07:26.780 --> 00:07:30.380
Nobody's really sure how many victims hiding claims, but according to him,

144
00:07:30.440 --> 00:07:34.190
he could've killed up to eight people just in the few months that he served as a

145
00:07:34.460 --> 00:07:35.293
capital drive.

146
00:07:41.380 --> 00:07:45.250
I think the most memorable part of Harden's life occurred in the summer of 1871.

147
00:07:45.251 --> 00:07:47.530
When he made his way to Aberdeen in Kansas.

148
00:07:47.740 --> 00:07:50.530
This is where he had a few run-ins with the local town. Marshall,

149
00:07:50.531 --> 00:07:54.070
who also happened to be one of the old West's most famous icons,

150
00:07:54.250 --> 00:07:55.750
wild bill Hickok. By the way,

151
00:07:55.751 --> 00:07:58.210
if you're not familiar with the many exploits of wild bill,

152
00:07:58.211 --> 00:08:01.000
we've already done a biographics video on him a few months ago.

153
00:08:01.001 --> 00:08:04.930
So maybe go check it out if you want to. Anyway, it went hard and got into town.

154
00:08:04.931 --> 00:08:07.060
He adopted the name Clements after his cousins,

155
00:08:07.210 --> 00:08:08.980
seeing as how you're still a wanted man.

156
00:08:09.040 --> 00:08:12.580
Most people including Hickok apparently called him little Arkansas or,

157
00:08:12.760 --> 00:08:16.540
and it is unclear who, if any, were aware of his true identity. At first,

158
00:08:16.541 --> 00:08:18.010
he got along well with wild bill,

159
00:08:18.011 --> 00:08:21.760
even having a few drinking sessions within then going on cattle drives together.

160
00:08:21.850 --> 00:08:24.190
And this is despite the fact that right off the bat,

161
00:08:24.370 --> 00:08:27.460
other people trying to turn harden against haircare coping that's.

162
00:08:27.461 --> 00:08:30.190
He might be the one to take down the ruthless lawman,

163
00:08:30.220 --> 00:08:33.700
who by that point had already built a fist and reputation for himself.

164
00:08:33.760 --> 00:08:35.830
According to harden, when he arrived in town,

165
00:08:35.860 --> 00:08:39.610
there was an ongoing conflict between the town Marshall and the proprietors of a

166
00:08:39.611 --> 00:08:41.920
local saloon named the bulls had Tavern.

167
00:08:42.130 --> 00:08:46.420
Those proprietors were businessmen Philco and Ben Thompson noted gunman in his

168
00:08:46.421 --> 00:08:47.170
own, right?

169
00:08:47.170 --> 00:08:50.260
They got into a dispute with heck over the logo painted on the side of that

170
00:08:50.261 --> 00:08:50.681
Tavern,

171
00:08:50.681 --> 00:08:53.830
which was a vulgar image of a bull after getting complaints from the locals.

172
00:08:53.831 --> 00:08:56.940
Wild bill told Cohen to change the picture they refused.

173
00:08:56.970 --> 00:09:00.330
So hick brought some painters and he did it himself. Since then,

174
00:09:00.331 --> 00:09:03.840
the two saloon gamers hated wild bills. Godson wants to go gone.

175
00:09:04.110 --> 00:09:07.470
This would have preferred if someone did the dirty work for them and to John

176
00:09:07.471 --> 00:09:11.220
Wesley Hardin, he and Ben Thompson quickly developed an amicable relationship.

177
00:09:11.790 --> 00:09:13.200
Hasn't frequented. The bulls had Tavern,

178
00:09:13.201 --> 00:09:16.830
a loss and Thompson had fought for the Confederacy during the civil war.

179
00:09:16.860 --> 00:09:18.480
And as we've previously mentioned,

180
00:09:18.780 --> 00:09:20.670
haunting was a diehard supporter of the South. Well,

181
00:09:20.790 --> 00:09:24.540
having nothing but murderous scorn for the Northern Yankees as it happens,

182
00:09:24.541 --> 00:09:26.820
wild bill Hickok served the union during the war.

183
00:09:26.821 --> 00:09:29.730
So Thompson saw a great opportunity to sow some dissent.

184
00:09:29.820 --> 00:09:34.020
He whispered in hardened Zare about how Hickok was the typical Yankee who hated

185
00:09:34.021 --> 00:09:35.820
southerners, particularly Texans,

186
00:09:35.821 --> 00:09:39.110
and always shot them dead at the slightest harden,

187
00:09:39.111 --> 00:09:42.980
saw where this was going and said that he had no interest in finding someone

188
00:09:42.981 --> 00:09:46.550
else's battle resorting to Thompson. If bill needs killing,

189
00:09:46.610 --> 00:09:49.010
why don't you kill him yourself? That being said,

190
00:09:49.340 --> 00:09:52.790
Hardin was eager to make it clear that he was not afraid of wild bill hiccup as

191
00:09:52.791 --> 00:09:56.360
soon evidenced by that very first confrontation. And just to be clear,

192
00:09:56.540 --> 00:09:59.630
we're not saying we believe for a minute, this is what actually happens,

193
00:09:59.631 --> 00:10:03.980
but we aren't the story exactly. As told by harden and his autobiography,

194
00:10:04.070 --> 00:10:06.380
one day he was bowling in one of the buildings,

195
00:10:06.381 --> 00:10:08.750
making a lot of noise with a bunch of other Texans.

196
00:10:09.170 --> 00:10:10.460
Hardened still had his guns on it.

197
00:10:10.640 --> 00:10:13.040
And even though he was supposed to disarm when in town,

198
00:10:13.100 --> 00:10:15.440
the Marshall entered the Tavern and told them to keep it cross.

199
00:10:15.450 --> 00:10:17.240
And that's when he sold it hot and was armed.

200
00:10:17.300 --> 00:10:19.280
The two of them exited the saloon peacefully,

201
00:10:19.310 --> 00:10:23.660
but harden acted reluctance to give up his guns, not one known for his patients.

202
00:10:23.960 --> 00:10:26.450
Wild bill drew his own revolver and went to arrest him.

203
00:10:26.570 --> 00:10:29.690
Odense slowly took out his weapons and handed them towards Hickok.

204
00:10:29.720 --> 00:10:34.610
But first the Marshall reacted to grab them hot and quickly spun them around in

205
00:10:34.611 --> 00:10:36.980
his hand so that all of a sudden wild bill,

206
00:10:37.130 --> 00:10:40.310
two barrels in his face and was forced to surrender his own gun.

207
00:10:40.400 --> 00:10:44.930
The trick was known as the road agent spin or the Carney bill spin as if this

208
00:10:44.931 --> 00:10:47.810
wasn't fantastical enough. All of the cities soon gathered around them,

209
00:10:47.811 --> 00:10:50.570
cheering on haunting and encouraging him to shoot ticket debt.

210
00:10:50.720 --> 00:10:52.850
At this point in the Marshall began pleading with the outlaw,

211
00:10:52.880 --> 00:10:55.730
not to let the angry mob gun him down request.

212
00:10:56.090 --> 00:11:00.950
That's the noble and heroic harden acquiesce do by shouting that it was his fine

213
00:11:01.070 --> 00:11:05.240
to learn and that he would kill the first man that finds a gun afterwards

214
00:11:05.241 --> 00:11:05.950
ticket,

215
00:11:05.950 --> 00:11:09.230
tried to befriend harden by telling him you're the game best and quickest.

216
00:11:09.231 --> 00:11:12.980
Boy I ever saw, let us compromise this matter. And I will be your friends.

217
00:11:13.010 --> 00:11:16.850
Let us go in here and take a drink as I want to talk to you and give you some

218
00:11:16.851 --> 00:11:19.520
advice. And the two Indeed's went into a private room,

219
00:11:19.550 --> 00:11:21.650
had a few drinks and came out as friends.

220
00:11:21.740 --> 00:11:26.300
And that's the story of the day that John Wesley Hardin drew on wild bill

221
00:11:26.301 --> 00:11:27.560
Hickok. At this point,

222
00:11:27.860 --> 00:11:31.820
you might be able to see why most wild bill historians didn't take Hardin's

223
00:11:32.480 --> 00:11:36.050
autobiography seriously and consider it more of a presentation of his personal

224
00:11:36.051 --> 00:11:39.050
fantasy than a factual historical accounts.

225
00:11:39.110 --> 00:11:42.620
There are quite a few problems with the story starting off with the idea that

226
00:11:42.621 --> 00:11:45.710
wild bill Hickok, which full of assumption trick in the first place.

227
00:11:45.770 --> 00:11:46.640
It's not impossible,

228
00:11:46.641 --> 00:11:49.970
but it's highly unlikely given how cautious he was around other gunman.

229
00:11:49.971 --> 00:11:54.700
And even if he did even more outlandish was the idea that Hickok would just let

230
00:11:54.701 --> 00:11:56.440
the whole thing go after a few drinks,

231
00:11:56.441 --> 00:12:00.460
especially when harden has just humiliated him in front of the whole town and

232
00:12:00.490 --> 00:12:03.280
basically destroyed his reputation as a fearsome gunslinger.

233
00:12:03.370 --> 00:12:07.990
Then there is also a total lack of other sources is hardened himself was the

234
00:12:08.140 --> 00:12:12.190
only ones who mentioned this event since last but not least harden only started

235
00:12:12.191 --> 00:12:14.050
sharing this tale after HECO could, or.

236
00:12:14.340 --> 00:12:15.173
<v 1>He died.</v>

237
00:12:21.900 --> 00:12:24.330
<v 0>But the most infamous moments of the heart and legends,</v>

238
00:12:24.360 --> 00:12:26.610
the nights when he killed a man for snoring,

239
00:12:26.850 --> 00:12:29.820
we should mention that while this event definitely happens,

240
00:12:29.821 --> 00:12:31.200
the details are conflicting.

241
00:12:31.260 --> 00:12:34.830
Although harden himself admitted to the deed at first, quite proudly. In fact,

242
00:12:35.010 --> 00:12:38.790
he later amended the story for his book instead of killing an unsuspecting

243
00:12:39.180 --> 00:12:40.050
defense, the sleeping man,

244
00:12:40.051 --> 00:12:44.490
he sheltered would be robber or even an assassin broke into his room and was

245
00:12:44.491 --> 00:12:46.590
armed with a deck dagger on August the sixth,

246
00:12:46.620 --> 00:12:51.060
1871 hardened put up for the night, the American house hotel in Adelaide.

247
00:12:51.240 --> 00:12:54.780
He went to bed only to discover that the man in the adjacent room was snoring

248
00:12:54.781 --> 00:12:55.614
very loudly.

249
00:12:55.800 --> 00:12:59.610
Whether the man was a complete stranger or a Confederate of hauntings is

250
00:12:59.790 --> 00:13:02.320
uncertain either way. Harden got so annoyed with him,

251
00:13:02.490 --> 00:13:04.410
but he began shooting through the shad wall.

252
00:13:04.530 --> 00:13:07.650
It's unclear if the outlaw intended to kill the man from the outset or if he

253
00:13:07.651 --> 00:13:09.870
just wanted to waken up and scam,

254
00:13:09.900 --> 00:13:13.320
but at least one bullet hit the sleeping man who died in his bed.

255
00:13:13.500 --> 00:13:17.250
Everybody heard the shots and while they may not have realized yet that hot and

256
00:13:17.520 --> 00:13:21.210
killed a man, he still broke the law by shooting his guns within city limits.

257
00:13:21.700 --> 00:13:25.770
And his deputies were on their way. So harden had to make a quick getaway.

258
00:13:25.860 --> 00:13:28.350
He did not have time to get dressed. So he left in his nightclothes.

259
00:13:28.380 --> 00:13:30.570
He climbed his out of his window and onto the porch roof.

260
00:13:30.720 --> 00:13:34.530
He jumped down into the street and hit inside a haystack where he stepped into a

261
00:13:34.531 --> 00:13:37.410
morning. When the sun came hot and crawled through a cornfield,

262
00:13:37.411 --> 00:13:40.230
until he ran into a lone cowboy, installed his horse,

263
00:13:40.231 --> 00:13:44.520
making his exit from Abilene. He would never return a few days later,

264
00:13:44.580 --> 00:13:46.860
a newspaper reported his crime. Simply noting this.

265
00:13:47.100 --> 00:13:49.970
A man was killed in his bed at a hotel in Adelaide,

266
00:13:49.990 --> 00:13:54.000
Monday nights by a Desperado called Arkansas. The matter escapes.

267
00:13:54.030 --> 00:13:57.240
This was his sixth Metta. This shows that at that point,

268
00:13:57.280 --> 00:14:01.080
authorities were still unaware that the gunfighter from Abilene was the same as

269
00:14:01.260 --> 00:14:04.980
John Wesley harden, who was wanted for a lot more than six murders,

270
00:14:05.010 --> 00:14:06.000
whatever the real number was.

271
00:14:06.090 --> 00:14:08.190
It didn't stay the same for long for the rest of the year.

272
00:14:08.610 --> 00:14:10.590
Harden went back to Texas where he was again,

273
00:14:10.591 --> 00:14:13.410
involved in multiple shootouts that resulted in fatalities,

274
00:14:13.411 --> 00:14:17.280
including that of a police officer named green paramour guilds on October the

275
00:14:17.281 --> 00:14:21.090
sixth, 1971, according to reports paramour and another officer names.

276
00:14:21.091 --> 00:14:24.510
John Lackey tried to arrest harden and a general store.

277
00:14:24.660 --> 00:14:28.140
And Noval Gonzales County, the killer pretended to discern, but again,

278
00:14:28.141 --> 00:14:31.680
use the road agents spin again. He shot both officers and made a run for us.

279
00:14:31.860 --> 00:14:33.630
Although Lackey survived his injury.

280
00:14:36.930 --> 00:14:37.763
<v 1>[Inaudible].</v>

281
00:14:40.500 --> 00:14:43.770
<v 0>Yeah, 1872. So hard and make an attempt to settle down the marriage.</v>

282
00:14:43.771 --> 00:14:46.440
A woman named Jane Bowen and the couple had three children together.

283
00:14:46.590 --> 00:14:47.101
At one point,

284
00:14:47.101 --> 00:14:50.190
he was injured in the gunfight and turned himself into the authorities,

285
00:14:50.220 --> 00:14:51.410
thinking he was going die,

286
00:14:51.560 --> 00:14:54.410
however hard and made a full recovery and see another change of hearts.

287
00:14:54.411 --> 00:14:56.990
Once he realized that he was going to be charged with multiple murders,

288
00:14:57.710 --> 00:15:00.410
escaped from jail and went on the run again in 1873,

289
00:15:00.800 --> 00:15:04.310
Hardin was in duet County taxes where he found himself embroiled in one of the

290
00:15:04.311 --> 00:15:06.860
longest and bloodiest rivalries of the old West.

291
00:15:06.890 --> 00:15:10.640
The Southern tailor viewed the exact origins of this conflict are a bit murky,

292
00:15:10.641 --> 00:15:15.110
but the animosity between these two families erupted into a full blown feud in

293
00:15:15.111 --> 00:15:18.500
1868, when William Sutton, deputy sheriff and Kenton,

294
00:15:18.501 --> 00:15:23.330
Texas Shelton killed Charlie Taylor during an arrest for horse theft later that

295
00:15:23.331 --> 00:15:26.780
same year Sutton killed another member of the Taylor family named buck,

296
00:15:26.781 --> 00:15:30.380
as well as an associate called Dick Chisolm during a saloon fight.

297
00:15:30.920 --> 00:15:33.920
Hodgkin joins the feud a few years later on behalf of the tailors who were

298
00:15:34.070 --> 00:15:36.260
introduced to him through his cousins, the planets,

299
00:15:36.380 --> 00:15:38.840
by the time the dispute ended in 1876,

300
00:15:38.841 --> 00:15:40.910
thanks to the intervention of the Texas Rangers.

301
00:15:41.090 --> 00:15:43.040
At least 35 people had been killed.

302
00:15:43.160 --> 00:15:45.710
How many of them died at the hands of John Wesley? Hunton is,

303
00:15:45.950 --> 00:15:50.030
I want to say is even he remained vague about his involvement in his book.

304
00:15:50.150 --> 00:15:52.880
He definitely took bonds in the murder of lawman Jack Hallam.

305
00:15:52.881 --> 00:15:55.910
Although he may have been an accomplice while Jim Taylor was the one who

306
00:15:55.911 --> 00:15:57.920
actually pulled the trigger on may the 26,

307
00:15:57.980 --> 00:16:02.270
1874 harden celebrated his 21st birthday by this point had already killed dozens

308
00:16:02.271 --> 00:16:06.470
of men and yet never really suffered any serious consequences for his actions.

309
00:16:06.500 --> 00:16:10.280
But as an ex murder would be the one that would finally land them in hot water

310
00:16:10.400 --> 00:16:12.440
harden was in a saloon in Comanche taxes,

311
00:16:12.441 --> 00:16:15.020
drinking with some of his associates in honor of his birthday.

312
00:16:15.290 --> 00:16:17.000
They got into a fight with deputy sheriff,

313
00:16:17.030 --> 00:16:20.840
Charles Webb and gunned him down pod in himself, managed to make a run for it.

314
00:16:20.841 --> 00:16:22.970
As although some of his accomplices were arrested,

315
00:16:23.000 --> 00:16:25.580
taken to jail and later killed by an angry mob.

316
00:16:25.670 --> 00:16:28.280
This ended Harden's involvement with the Southern Taylor few,

317
00:16:28.281 --> 00:16:32.060
does he have to flee the state traveling first to Alabama and then to Florida,

318
00:16:32.120 --> 00:16:35.120
he was finally captured in 1977 in Pensacola, Florida,

319
00:16:35.300 --> 00:16:37.580
and transferred back to Texas to stand trial.

320
00:16:43.750 --> 00:16:44.583
<v 2>For some reason. Yeah.</v>

321
00:16:44.800 --> 00:16:48.370
<v 0>Harden was only charged initially with webs murder for which he received 25</v>

322
00:16:48.371 --> 00:16:49.570
years in Huntsville prison.

323
00:16:49.690 --> 00:16:52.510
He later routed a second two year sentence for another murder,

324
00:16:52.810 --> 00:16:55.870
but as part of a plea bargain and he was allowed to serve both sentences

325
00:16:55.871 --> 00:16:57.940
concurrently at first Harding was a problem.

326
00:16:57.941 --> 00:17:01.390
Inmate getting into multiple fights and being part of several unsuccessful

327
00:17:01.391 --> 00:17:04.510
escape attempts with time. However, he began adapting his prison life.

328
00:17:04.660 --> 00:17:07.570
He spends a lot of time writing his fabricated autobiography.

329
00:17:07.810 --> 00:17:11.800
He became a constant attendant at Sunday school and began studying law books.

330
00:17:11.860 --> 00:17:15.190
Believe it or not Hardin actually passed the lore exam and made a half-hearted

331
00:17:15.191 --> 00:17:17.470
attempt at setting up a legitimate practice.

332
00:17:17.471 --> 00:17:20.560
When he was released before falling back into his old ways,

333
00:17:20.650 --> 00:17:22.270
the Texas governor pardoned Harding,

334
00:17:22.420 --> 00:17:25.480
the good behavior after serving 16 years in 1894,

335
00:17:25.481 --> 00:17:27.640
he went to Gonzalez to be with his kids.

336
00:17:27.680 --> 00:17:31.120
His wife had passed away while he was in prison. This new one reforms hardened,

337
00:17:31.140 --> 00:17:34.720
and it lasted a few months. And before you knew it was back on his own, again,

338
00:17:34.900 --> 00:17:37.840
this time he was located in El Paso, Texas, at one point,

339
00:17:38.200 --> 00:17:41.680
Hardin goes into an altercation with a local law man named John Selman Jr.

340
00:17:41.681 --> 00:17:44.020
After the latter had arrested Hardin's girlfriends,

341
00:17:44.380 --> 00:17:46.090
carrying a gun within city limits,

342
00:17:46.150 --> 00:17:49.090
the fight got pretty heated and the former outlaw threatened Solomon's life.

343
00:17:49.320 --> 00:17:52.650
What of this reach? The young offices, father Johns Elman, senior,

344
00:17:52.680 --> 00:17:57.360
who also had a violent poss like harden serving as both Norman and lawbreaker at

345
00:17:57.361 --> 00:17:59.850
times you understood what kind of man hot him was,

346
00:17:59.851 --> 00:18:03.300
and probably considered him a threat to his family. On the afternoon of August,

347
00:18:03.301 --> 00:18:04.134
the 19th,

348
00:18:04.680 --> 00:18:08.610
1895 Selman ends at the acne saloon where harden was playing dice and shot him

349
00:18:08.611 --> 00:18:10.530
in the back of the head, killing him instantly.

350
00:18:10.680 --> 00:18:13.200
He then brought a few more bullets into his chest for good measure.

351
00:18:13.800 --> 00:18:15.780
Solomon was arrested and tried for Hardin's murder,

352
00:18:15.781 --> 00:18:17.520
but was released following a hung jury.

353
00:18:17.760 --> 00:18:21.390
His defense was that harden had seen him into the saloon in the mirror and was

354
00:18:21.391 --> 00:18:22.560
reaching for his gun.

355
00:18:22.580 --> 00:18:26.580
So he shot him in self-defense Selman was never put on trial again because less

356
00:18:26.581 --> 00:18:30.030
than a year later, he was also killed in a shootout with us. Marshall,

357
00:18:30.031 --> 00:18:33.450
George Scarborough, as for Hardin, he was buried as a local cemetery,

358
00:18:33.451 --> 00:18:36.840
but it kept staring off controversy even a hundred years after his death.

359
00:18:36.900 --> 00:18:40.440
His descendants began petitioning to have him dug up from El Paso and buried in

360
00:18:40.441 --> 00:18:43.710
Nixon, Texas next to his wife, Jane, the residents of El Paso.

361
00:18:43.800 --> 00:18:46.500
You didn't want to give him up because his grave was a popular tourist

362
00:18:46.501 --> 00:18:48.330
attraction. So a lawsuit ensued,

363
00:18:48.331 --> 00:18:52.810
which was eventually ruled in favor of keeping John Wesley Hardin and I'll pass

364
00:18:53.040 --> 00:18:56.610
so well. He's still rests to this day. So I really hope you found this video.
