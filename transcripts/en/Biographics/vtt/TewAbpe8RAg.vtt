00:00:00.060 --> 00:00:04.880
<v 0>100 Years ago, bay reclusive check Jew, living anonymously, amid Prague expires,</v>

2
00:00:04.881 --> 00:00:08.280
managed to change the way we see the world. He was the son of a shopkeeper,

3
00:00:08.840 --> 00:00:12.520
an insurance lie by trade Bowly. He appeared sickly forgettable,

4
00:00:12.740 --> 00:00:17.520
but inside will inside the Sal young man's mind was alive

5
00:00:17.670 --> 00:00:18.840
with visions of horror,

6
00:00:19.070 --> 00:00:23.550
with paranoia access to dread and alienation working at night,

7
00:00:23.570 --> 00:00:27.390
he took those visions and he etched them onto paper, creating fiction.

8
00:00:27.770 --> 00:00:32.510
<v 1>Unlike anything seen before that young man's name was France Kafka and his work</v>

9
00:00:32.511 --> 00:00:35.150
would shape the entire 20th century

10
00:00:41.690 --> 00:00:45.820
Born into a German speaking family in the Austria-Hungarian empire Kafka spent

11
00:00:45.821 --> 00:00:49.580
his whole life suffering from illness and anxiety. He was miserable at home,

12
00:00:49.730 --> 00:00:52.620
unlucky in love and too depressed to function anywhere,

13
00:00:52.880 --> 00:00:54.660
but in his insurance office, yes,

14
00:00:54.760 --> 00:00:57.500
he made up for this by having a mind so strange,

15
00:00:57.920 --> 00:01:02.250
so innovative that today he's arguably Europe's famous author.

16
00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:07.170
Join us as we delve inside the work of France Kafka and the awful

17
00:01:07.400 --> 00:01:08.810
life that made it possible.

18
00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:17.170
<v 0>It was a hot July day in 1883.</v>

19
00:01:17.171 --> 00:01:19.530
When Herman Kafka became a father for the first time,

20
00:01:19.850 --> 00:01:22.440
a Prue shopkeeper from a working class Jewish family,

21
00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:25.720
Herman was a man who'd fought all his life to get where he was.

22
00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:27.640
His battle had been a tough one.

23
00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:30.640
1883 was the era of the Austria Hungarian empire.

24
00:01:30.641 --> 00:01:35.520
When Prague was dominated by Germans and Jews were at a constant disadvantage

25
00:01:35.590 --> 00:01:38.640
through the share force of his gigantic volatile personality.

26
00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:43.230
Herman had managed to take a little clothing, sharp and tan into a bus store.

27
00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:45.830
He'd bought a fancy house, found an educated wife,

28
00:01:45.860 --> 00:01:49.390
even broken into the closed worlds of the German elites.

29
00:01:49.610 --> 00:01:53.710
<v 1>And now his first son had arrived. The son knew is going to be as sporty,</v>

30
00:01:53.850 --> 00:01:58.470
as commanding as powerful and as straightforwardly dramatic as his old man

31
00:01:58.471 --> 00:01:59.304
affected to be.

32
00:01:59.540 --> 00:02:03.540
It's likely that as Herman took baby France Kafka into his arms for the first

33
00:02:03.570 --> 00:02:06.380
time that he felt a rush of pride, if he did,

34
00:02:06.640 --> 00:02:10.460
it was the last time he had felt anything but contempt for his son.

35
00:02:10.770 --> 00:02:11.740
<v 0>From the earlier stage,</v>

36
00:02:11.741 --> 00:02:15.980
it was obvious that France Kafka was not the stout hearty man that Herman wanted

37
00:02:15.981 --> 00:02:18.260
him to be. The boy was small and sickly.

38
00:02:18.280 --> 00:02:23.060
He was troubled by boils and afflicted with melancholy from Herman's perspective

39
00:02:24.090 --> 00:02:25.410
was a little like opening a box.

40
00:02:25.690 --> 00:02:29.010
You thing is going to contain a delicious cake only to discover that it instead

41
00:02:29.050 --> 00:02:33.250
contains just bitter disappointment from France Kafka's perspective.

42
00:02:33.270 --> 00:02:37.450
It was like being born into a world where everything you did was doomed to end

43
00:02:37.451 --> 00:02:40.450
in humiliation. Herman was an angry man at the best of times,

44
00:02:40.550 --> 00:02:44.840
but something about his ineffectual son seems to have actively offended him.

45
00:02:44.940 --> 00:02:47.360
<v 1>He would exploded young Kafka for no reason,</v>

46
00:02:47.560 --> 00:02:52.120
belittle him endlessly for being useless, pathetic failure of a human.

47
00:02:52.150 --> 00:02:56.360
Perhaps it is not surprising that by the time Kafka started school,

48
00:02:56.500 --> 00:02:58.800
his self-esteem was in the gut up still.

49
00:02:58.801 --> 00:03:02.120
While he may have done everything in his power to destroy his son's confidence

50
00:03:02.140 --> 00:03:02.700
at home.

51
00:03:02.700 --> 00:03:05.680
<v 0>Herman was still at heart, a social climate.</v>

52
00:03:05.790 --> 00:03:10.080
That means making sure that outwardly Kafka appeared to have every advantage in

53
00:03:10.110 --> 00:03:11.960
life as Hermann's business boomed.

54
00:03:11.961 --> 00:03:16.600
He began ending Kafka to the elite out starter star to NA having one of the

55
00:03:16.760 --> 00:03:20.670
families check servants walked the there every morning for the working class

56
00:03:21.070 --> 00:03:21.230
Jew.

57
00:03:21.230 --> 00:03:24.990
It must have been a whole peacock worth of feathers in his cap to send the boy

58
00:03:24.991 --> 00:03:28.990
somewhere so prestigious, but for his shy miserable son,

59
00:03:29.290 --> 00:03:31.830
it was simply hell Kafka hated the school.

60
00:03:31.831 --> 00:03:34.310
He absolutely hated it while he did well academically,

61
00:03:34.311 --> 00:03:37.790
he found the place to be authoritarian, dehumanizing and alienating.

62
00:03:38.170 --> 00:03:43.100
It was around this time that a black parasite first began to tunnel its way into

63
00:03:43.101 --> 00:03:46.380
the boy's brain. That parasite was what we'd call today.

64
00:03:46.700 --> 00:03:48.500
A serious anxiety disorder.

65
00:03:48.720 --> 00:03:53.020
One that made Kafka constantly feel like there was a ball of wire at the center

66
00:03:53.021 --> 00:03:56.900
of his body. Winding of tighter. If you've ever suffered from anxiety,

67
00:03:56.901 --> 00:04:01.370
you'll know that suffering is exactly the right term to use. Well, friends,

68
00:04:01.540 --> 00:04:04.410
Kafka would suffer from it for the rest of his life. However,

69
00:04:04.411 --> 00:04:05.490
the boys teenage years,

70
00:04:06.090 --> 00:04:10.090
they were not all bad news between the emotional abuse at home and his miserable

71
00:04:10.091 --> 00:04:12.730
life at school Kafka needed an outlet somewhere.

72
00:04:12.750 --> 00:04:16.050
He could escape to a warm bar that he would climb into.

73
00:04:16.270 --> 00:04:18.650
It was at this time that the boy started writing

74
00:04:25.150 --> 00:04:29.840
Come 1902 France KACO was studying law at Charles university and writing on the

75
00:04:29.841 --> 00:04:32.000
site. It actually wanted to study chemistry,

76
00:04:32.020 --> 00:04:35.120
but had switched to law after two weeks when Herman pressured him,

77
00:04:35.121 --> 00:04:38.880
because law would look better to the family's middle class friends and with his

78
00:04:38.881 --> 00:04:43.470
son already a self-declared a theist and socialist Herman desperately needed a

79
00:04:43.471 --> 00:04:46.830
new feather for his suddenly Bera looking cap.

80
00:04:47.470 --> 00:04:51.430
Yet even with his father still controlling his life at university Kafka managed

81
00:04:51.431 --> 00:04:55.470
to E out some space for himself. He joins lesser unre,

82
00:04:55.710 --> 00:04:59.390
har doin Stu Aton, uh, literary club, the German speakers.

83
00:04:59.830 --> 00:05:03.380
While this club he met the man who had one day come to define Kafka's legacy.

84
00:05:03.730 --> 00:05:07.180
This man was max broad, born a year after Kafka.

85
00:05:07.240 --> 00:05:09.340
Max broad was an outgoing Jewish, intellectual.

86
00:05:09.341 --> 00:05:13.820
He was charming creative intelligence and everything that Kafka felt that he

87
00:05:13.821 --> 00:05:18.060
himself was not nonetheless the two hit it off, forming their own little clique.

88
00:05:18.240 --> 00:05:21.970
It would be this close friendship that later saved Kafka's writing from the

89
00:05:21.980 --> 00:05:25.890
ashes, but not yet. Rod and Kafka were just students at this time,

90
00:05:26.050 --> 00:05:28.410
a long way from actually publishing their stories.

91
00:05:28.670 --> 00:05:31.410
So when Kafka finally graduated in June of 1906,

92
00:05:31.411 --> 00:05:35.250
it was not into a life of writing and plumbing, the depths of the human soul,

93
00:05:35.310 --> 00:05:39.770
but into a life of working as an unpaid clerk for the local courts to say,

94
00:05:40.170 --> 00:05:40.900
Kafka found this job,

95
00:05:40.900 --> 00:05:44.320
crushingly dull would be to overestimate how exciting it was.

96
00:05:44.620 --> 00:05:47.960
The work left him cranky, depressed, and lethargic worse.

97
00:05:48.180 --> 00:05:51.800
<v 1>He was still living at home, still dealing with Herman's volcanic,</v>

98
00:05:51.801 --> 00:05:56.720
temper and tiny cruelties. His only solace was that it would soon be over soon.

99
00:05:56.970 --> 00:06:00.200
Kafka would have enough experience to join an international office.

100
00:06:00.340 --> 00:06:04.320
One that would send him abroad and away from his father in October of 1907,

101
00:06:04.450 --> 00:06:07.200
Kafka finally signed up with an Italian insurance company,

102
00:06:07.290 --> 00:06:10.120
fully expecting to be sent down to Italy any day.

103
00:06:10.390 --> 00:06:12.600
<v 0>Instead he found himself stuck in a Prague office,</v>

104
00:06:12.601 --> 00:06:16.240
dealing with suffocating bureaucracy, unpaid overtime,

105
00:06:16.690 --> 00:06:19.310
brutal hours that left him to exhausted to write.

106
00:06:19.490 --> 00:06:22.750
By the time Kafka finally resigned his dream of living abroad.

107
00:06:23.210 --> 00:06:27.350
It had been crushed. Instead. He meekly resigned himself to staying at home,

108
00:06:27.490 --> 00:06:32.230
to living in Prague and sharing a house with Herman and living with his father's

109
00:06:32.510 --> 00:06:34.910
constant putdowns in August, 1908.

110
00:06:35.040 --> 00:06:38.860
Kafka began his new job at the work of accident insurance Institute in the

111
00:06:38.861 --> 00:06:43.100
shadow of PR castle. He would stay there for the rest of his working life.

112
00:06:43.320 --> 00:06:47.460
But even as Kafka's dream of leaving his abuser far behind faded into distant

113
00:06:47.520 --> 00:06:48.240
memory,

114
00:06:48.240 --> 00:06:52.260
he began to nurture another Kafka's new job finished in the mid afternoon.

115
00:06:52.400 --> 00:06:56.100
If he slept after it finished, that meant he could wake up after dark and spend.

116
00:06:56.170 --> 00:07:00.610
Most of the night writing Kafka would later say that this routine felt less like

117
00:07:00.650 --> 00:07:03.450
a calling or a hobby than a form of communication.

118
00:07:03.660 --> 00:07:08.650
Maybe even a penance with writing being the only way he could atone for the sins

119
00:07:08.651 --> 00:07:11.610
that he was convinced, filled his stick thin body.

120
00:07:12.000 --> 00:07:15.970
That same year Mag's broad convinced Kafka to publish his first stories.

121
00:07:16.610 --> 00:07:20.520
Although they sold poorly, the reaction was good enough to convince Kafka,

122
00:07:20.521 --> 00:07:21.354
to keep writing.

123
00:07:27.580 --> 00:07:30.440
In August of 1912, Kafka arrived at a dinner party.

124
00:07:30.940 --> 00:07:34.440
Max Broad's homes find his friend had an unexpected guest.

125
00:07:34.880 --> 00:07:38.400
It was now four years since Kafka had published his collection of stories and he

126
00:07:38.570 --> 00:07:42.830
was waste deep in the novel that would've later become America, AKA,

127
00:07:43.210 --> 00:07:44.270
the man who disappeared.

128
00:07:44.690 --> 00:07:48.310
But that night literature was the furthest thing from Kafka's mind.

129
00:07:48.570 --> 00:07:51.510
He was too busy thinking about the woman sat opposite him.

130
00:07:51.770 --> 00:07:56.350
If Elise Bower was one of those friends of a friends of a cousin types that the

131
00:07:56.440 --> 00:08:00.300
gregarious broad would invite to his home. A woman usually lived in Berlin,

132
00:08:00.560 --> 00:08:02.620
but was visiting Prague in his diary.

133
00:08:02.710 --> 00:08:07.100
Kafka would later ride that she had a bony E empty face that wore emptiness

134
00:08:07.280 --> 00:08:11.620
openly bare throat, a blouse on almost broken nose, blond,

135
00:08:11.940 --> 00:08:15.860
somewhat straight unattractive hair, strong chin. As I was taking my seat,

136
00:08:15.980 --> 00:08:19.220
I looked at her closely for the first time. By the time I was seated,

137
00:08:19.730 --> 00:08:21.890
I already had an unshakable opinion.

138
00:08:22.520 --> 00:08:26.570
That unshakable opinion was that he was in love this being France Kafka.

139
00:08:26.571 --> 00:08:30.410
The courtship that started that summer evening, it wasn't exactly conventional.

140
00:08:30.510 --> 00:08:34.210
He waited until feles Bower had gone back to Berlin before telling her of his

141
00:08:34.211 --> 00:08:38.050
feelings via letter from then on the two were writing to one another two times

142
00:08:38.230 --> 00:08:41.760
per day, or well, Kafka was at any rate for her part.

143
00:08:42.200 --> 00:08:43.640
Bower seems to have been flattered,

144
00:08:43.660 --> 00:08:48.080
but maybe not quite to the extent of writing long, harder ending letters,

145
00:08:48.081 --> 00:08:51.520
every few hours still her effect on the writer was palpable.

146
00:08:51.740 --> 00:08:55.240
Not six weeks after they'd met Kafka sat down one evening at his desk,

147
00:08:55.520 --> 00:08:58.800
overlooking the Plava river. By the time he got up again, it was Dawn.

148
00:08:58.980 --> 00:09:02.440
His legs were in agony and had just finished his first masterpiece.

149
00:09:02.780 --> 00:09:07.320
The judgements is a hard tale to describe in the it's a typically Kafka short

150
00:09:07.370 --> 00:09:09.080
story without an easy meaning.

151
00:09:09.260 --> 00:09:12.440
The basic plot is that a young man goes to tend to his sick father,

152
00:09:12.620 --> 00:09:14.440
but as the tail progresses,

153
00:09:14.570 --> 00:09:19.390
the father grows in stature and power until like some terrible tyrant king.

154
00:09:19.391 --> 00:09:23.230
He rises from badge and condemns the young man to death by drowning.

155
00:09:23.290 --> 00:09:27.830
The man immediately goes and throws himself in the lava. And well,

156
00:09:27.860 --> 00:09:31.550
it's not exactly hard to imagine where the inspiration for that tale came from

157
00:09:31.950 --> 00:09:34.270
yet. If this tale sounds slight in our description,

158
00:09:34.710 --> 00:09:39.300
actually reading it is a whole other experience that the tale is dark, humorous,

159
00:09:39.301 --> 00:09:40.500
almost allegorical,

160
00:09:40.520 --> 00:09:44.540
but at the same time shot through with a sense of grands of themes.

161
00:09:45.020 --> 00:09:48.220
Looking beneath the surface, just out of reach for Kafka.

162
00:09:48.221 --> 00:09:50.980
It was the first good thing he ever wrote. The moments when he met him,

163
00:09:50.981 --> 00:09:55.770
authorized from a man who did some writing to an actual writer. That's in you a,

164
00:09:55.771 --> 00:10:00.690
he would sit down and write a much more literal tale of metamorphosis about Greg

165
00:10:00.890 --> 00:10:05.730
or Samza who woke up one morning from uneasy dreams to find himself changed

166
00:10:05.950 --> 00:10:08.090
in his bed, into a monstrous ver,

167
00:10:08.550 --> 00:10:12.730
but while the metamorph would be the only work in Kafka's lifetime that sold

168
00:10:12.840 --> 00:10:15.290
well and would remain his best known story.

169
00:10:15.510 --> 00:10:20.080
It was judgements that the author considered to be his masterpiece at the top of

170
00:10:20.081 --> 00:10:24.240
his masterpiece. He scrolled a dedication to miss Felic Bower.

171
00:10:30.470 --> 00:10:34.480
When you look at this period of France Kafka's life, it's remarkable.

172
00:10:34.510 --> 00:10:36.240
Just how closely his work,

173
00:10:36.480 --> 00:10:41.470
how parallels his relationship with Bower remarkable because the two belly ever

174
00:10:41.570 --> 00:10:44.510
met, although they constantly sent one, another letters.

175
00:10:44.640 --> 00:10:49.310
Kafka constantly turned down chances to meet his beloved in the flesh.

176
00:10:49.610 --> 00:10:52.670
He was too busy at work. His writing required attention.

177
00:10:52.890 --> 00:10:56.990
He had a headache and was washing his hair. It's been suggested the,

178
00:10:57.380 --> 00:11:01.060
the paradox at the heart of Kafka's life is that he thought he wanted to be left

179
00:11:01.061 --> 00:11:04.100
completely alone, but secretly craved human contact,

180
00:11:04.720 --> 00:11:07.220
or maybe was the other way rounds still.

181
00:11:07.280 --> 00:11:11.380
He evidently longed for company enough to eventually proposed Bower by letter

182
00:11:11.570 --> 00:11:16.300
naturally on may the 31st, 1914, the couple finally met face to face. Again,

183
00:11:16.550 --> 00:11:17.810
their engagement by party,

184
00:11:18.210 --> 00:11:23.010
surrounded by his family and Felic Kafka felt nothing but bottomless misery

185
00:11:23.070 --> 00:11:26.970
before three months were out. The two had mutually broken off their engagements.

186
00:11:27.610 --> 00:11:29.450
Although they'd wind up getting back together,

187
00:11:29.670 --> 00:11:34.010
you can see clearly the effect this rollercoaster had on Kafka's work.

188
00:11:34.530 --> 00:11:38.960
1914 was the year he abandoned America with just one chat to left to, right?

189
00:11:39.110 --> 00:11:42.680
It's the year he wrote in the penal colony, a grim cruel story.

190
00:11:42.681 --> 00:11:44.640
That's even darker than the judgment.

191
00:11:45.070 --> 00:11:48.800
It's also the year he started his most famous novel of all the trial.

192
00:11:49.190 --> 00:11:51.080
It's the story of a man, Joseph K,

193
00:11:51.100 --> 00:11:55.360
who is charged with a crime without ever knowing what the crime is. The trial.

194
00:11:55.550 --> 00:11:59.800
It's a landmark of absurd alienated fiction for chapter after chapter,

195
00:12:00.200 --> 00:12:04.360
Joseph K tries desperately to find out what he's guilty of while uncovering all

196
00:12:04.361 --> 00:12:07.000
sorts of bizarre figures, grotesque, tortures,

197
00:12:07.260 --> 00:12:11.000
and strange sexualized rituals happening in secret rooms. By the end,

198
00:12:11.580 --> 00:12:14.590
we still don't know, know what crime he committed because it's so ambiguous.

199
00:12:14.810 --> 00:12:19.470
The trial has come to symbolize a million things to a million readers for some

200
00:12:19.471 --> 00:12:22.430
Joseph K's crime is simply that he's human for others.

201
00:12:22.620 --> 00:12:26.430
It's that he's a Jew living in an antisemitic world. Others see,

202
00:12:26.550 --> 00:12:30.910
and it's a premonition of the Soviet union secret police in the 1960s or Wales

203
00:12:30.980 --> 00:12:35.700
made a film version that hinted Joe K was targeted for being gay in short,

204
00:12:35.701 --> 00:12:38.500
the trial is one of those books. That's so universal.

205
00:12:38.900 --> 00:12:42.140
Everyone can see their own experiences reflected in it,

206
00:12:42.360 --> 00:12:45.180
but not during Kafka's lifetime. In 1915,

207
00:12:45.181 --> 00:12:49.580
the reclusive writer slipped the manuscript of the trial into a desk draw and he

208
00:12:49.581 --> 00:12:50.420
never looked at it again.

209
00:12:50.720 --> 00:12:54.370
The following year Kafka ran for this bow spent nearly two weeks in the spar

210
00:12:54.440 --> 00:12:57.130
town of Marion, bad attempting to patch things up.

211
00:12:57.360 --> 00:13:01.810
This worked since on July the 12th, 1917, the two got engaged all over again.

212
00:13:01.960 --> 00:13:05.890
This time they even started making plans to live together in Prague.

213
00:13:06.070 --> 00:13:10.770
But 1917 was also the year France Kafka got some life changing news or

214
00:13:10.900 --> 00:13:14.520
maybe life ending might be more accurate that year.

215
00:13:14.620 --> 00:13:19.000
He was diagnosed with tuberculosis in the early years of the 20th century,

216
00:13:19.001 --> 00:13:22.880
tuberculosis was a death sentence. The disease killed Andrew Jackson,

217
00:13:23.560 --> 00:13:23.561
Jane Austin,

218
00:13:23.561 --> 00:13:28.440
George Allwell and was once estimated to have killed 15% of all people who

219
00:13:28.441 --> 00:13:29.440
had ever lived.

220
00:13:29.700 --> 00:13:33.480
And it would kill France Kafka two in December, 1917,

221
00:13:33.640 --> 00:13:38.350
a sick and Kafka broke off his engagement to Fise for a second time for Fise.

222
00:13:38.540 --> 00:13:39.870
This was the last straw.

223
00:13:39.970 --> 00:13:44.350
She cut off contact with her former fiance and found a more stable man to marry

224
00:13:44.730 --> 00:13:47.670
the part of Kafka that wished he could be completely alone,

225
00:13:47.970 --> 00:13:49.230
had gotten what it wanted

226
00:13:55.560 --> 00:13:57.500
On October the 28th, 1918,

227
00:13:57.560 --> 00:14:02.420
the O Hungarian empire gave one last grown and finally collapsed as world war

228
00:14:02.540 --> 00:14:06.220
I drew to a close Prague found itself no longer under dramatic rule,

229
00:14:06.280 --> 00:14:11.020
but part of a new Republic composed of checks and SL backs that is workplace

230
00:14:11.500 --> 00:14:15.380
Kafka was taken for questioning along with all other German speakers to see if

231
00:14:15.381 --> 00:14:16.970
they, he supported this new regime,

232
00:14:17.140 --> 00:14:19.730
those who were actively against it were fired,

233
00:14:19.990 --> 00:14:23.930
but we can only imagine that Kafka didn't really care much about all that stuff.

234
00:14:24.070 --> 00:14:26.730
He had more important things to worry about in early 19,

235
00:14:27.010 --> 00:14:30.850
19 Kafka was taking some time away from Prague in a boarding house when he just

236
00:14:30.851 --> 00:14:35.210
so happened to meet Julie wack has only 28. He was nearly 80 years as junior,

237
00:14:35.390 --> 00:14:40.040
but still the two fell to talking and bonded over a shared love of Yiddish

238
00:14:40.041 --> 00:14:43.680
theater and risque humor. By the time they both returned to Prague,

239
00:14:44.160 --> 00:14:48.480
Kafka had decided to marry her as firm bases for a lasting relationship go.

240
00:14:48.481 --> 00:14:52.080
There are probably better ones, but still Wareck agreed.

241
00:14:52.180 --> 00:14:55.640
And an excited Kafka ran to tell his parents at which point,

242
00:14:55.700 --> 00:14:59.920
Herman Kafka detonated like a pink and flabby bomb.

243
00:15:00.300 --> 00:15:03.040
If Herman disapproved of his useless son in general,

244
00:15:03.150 --> 00:15:07.720
then you'd have to invent whole new ways of measuring disapproval to understand

245
00:15:07.820 --> 00:15:11.390
how he felt about this whirlwinds marriage for the next few months,

246
00:15:11.540 --> 00:15:15.430
Kafka's father Harang him bullied him brow, beat him over his plans.

247
00:15:15.690 --> 00:15:17.910
At first Kafka tried to stand his grounds,

248
00:15:17.911 --> 00:15:21.990
but a lifetime of belittling had crushed his self-esteem down to nothing in

249
00:15:22.150 --> 00:15:25.350
November 19, 19 Kafka broke off his engagement with Roza,

250
00:15:25.750 --> 00:15:29.270
not long after Kafka left Prague again and checked himself into the same guest

251
00:15:29.271 --> 00:15:32.060
house where had met his second fiance there.

252
00:15:32.060 --> 00:15:34.180
He sat down and composed a letter to his father.

253
00:15:34.330 --> 00:15:37.900
Finally saying all the things he was too scared to say to his face,

254
00:15:37.930 --> 00:15:42.820
running up 45 pages Kafka's letter to his father was his own judgements on

255
00:15:42.821 --> 00:15:45.220
the Tyrons who'd raised him. What's remarkable.

256
00:15:45.230 --> 00:15:47.580
Today is just how clear eye it was.

257
00:15:47.990 --> 00:15:51.300
Kafka was at pains to stress that he understood his father's position.

258
00:15:51.790 --> 00:15:55.730
He knew dragging herself up from a working class background was not an easy

259
00:15:55.731 --> 00:15:58.730
thing to do while Herman may be the villain in our story today.

260
00:15:58.800 --> 00:16:02.530
It's worth remembering that no one in real life is purely evil.

261
00:16:02.750 --> 00:16:06.610
Herman Kafka was just a man who'd been taught by the snobbish society.

262
00:16:06.630 --> 00:16:08.770
He lived in that only being loud,

263
00:16:09.260 --> 00:16:13.040
brash and angry would get him noticed to get him respected.

264
00:16:13.270 --> 00:16:17.200
It's just a shame that he felt these qualities should apply to his parenting.

265
00:16:17.300 --> 00:16:18.760
To at the end of the letter,

266
00:16:19.010 --> 00:16:22.400
Kafka wrote that he hoped his honesty would open the door to an improved

267
00:16:22.401 --> 00:16:23.960
relationship between the two of them,

268
00:16:24.380 --> 00:16:28.720
but then SHA and insecure to the last he chickened out of posting it.

269
00:16:29.020 --> 00:16:31.040
The next year possibly is rebounds.

270
00:16:31.050 --> 00:16:35.390
Kafka started a relationship with one of his translators in Vienna AZE girl

271
00:16:35.391 --> 00:16:38.790
called millennia Syska. But when November rolled around again,

272
00:16:38.960 --> 00:16:41.790
Kafka abruptly broke off the relationship. Once again,

273
00:16:41.890 --> 00:16:45.470
the twisted version of Herman sitting in the center of Kafka's mind had

274
00:16:45.660 --> 00:16:48.110
condemned the writer to a living death.

275
00:16:54.530 --> 00:16:59.460
Kurt VGA once wrote that Kafka's stories exemplify a certain type of fiction in

276
00:16:59.461 --> 00:17:03.700
which the protagonist starts miserable only to see things get continuously

277
00:17:03.790 --> 00:17:07.300
worse. The same was true of Kafka's life. Fair warning.

278
00:17:07.301 --> 00:17:10.020
There's going to be no heroic moments in this tale,

279
00:17:10.160 --> 00:17:15.050
no emotional climax where Kafka managers to find, stand up to Herman,

280
00:17:15.150 --> 00:17:18.930
get the girl and ride off into Prague. Sunset. No,

281
00:17:19.040 --> 00:17:23.890
instead we're going to watch a miserable man's life get continually worse until

282
00:17:23.891 --> 00:17:27.330
it ends. The only way that it can by 1922,

283
00:17:27.710 --> 00:17:31.210
it was obvious what that ending would be that year Kafka's tuberculosis.

284
00:17:31.230 --> 00:17:35.320
It got so bad that he was finally forced to retire from work. In one sense,

285
00:17:35.321 --> 00:17:36.600
this was essentially a good thing.

286
00:17:36.850 --> 00:17:39.960
Kafka had long wished he could devote himself to writing full time.

287
00:17:40.060 --> 00:17:42.360
And now there was nothing stopping him that January.

288
00:17:42.540 --> 00:17:45.920
He began writing his last great work. The castle,

289
00:17:46.100 --> 00:17:48.080
the story of a man known only as Kay,

290
00:17:48.180 --> 00:17:52.160
the castle follows Kay's attempts to meet the authorities presiding over a

291
00:17:52.161 --> 00:17:57.000
snowbound town. Not only to discover his path blocked at every turn today,

292
00:17:57.001 --> 00:18:00.880
the castle is seen as Kafka's most mature novel, but Kafka himself,

293
00:18:01.020 --> 00:18:03.200
he didn't feel this way on September the 11th,

294
00:18:03.640 --> 00:18:07.880
1922 Kafka wrote to max broad to inform him that he'd given up on the story and

295
00:18:07.881 --> 00:18:09.590
he would never turn to it yet.

296
00:18:09.610 --> 00:18:13.310
It wouldn't be fair to say that Kafka had also given up on life. The next year,

297
00:18:13.311 --> 00:18:15.350
the sick man moved to Berlin. One day,

298
00:18:15.351 --> 00:18:19.150
he booked himself a trip to the resort down of merges to try and help his

299
00:18:19.151 --> 00:18:19.984
tuberculosis.

300
00:18:20.090 --> 00:18:24.950
It was while on the shore that Kafka met Dora Dimond a 19 year old socialist.

301
00:18:25.100 --> 00:18:26.710
Dora was 20 years Kafka's junior,

302
00:18:27.090 --> 00:18:31.340
but she was also fiercely intelligent with hard edged political beliefs and a

303
00:18:31.341 --> 00:18:35.180
passionate support for Zionism that CHID with Kafka's own feelings,

304
00:18:35.350 --> 00:18:39.860
admir Murs the two talked and talked until finally it seemed only natural that

305
00:18:39.970 --> 00:18:42.100
Dora would return to Berlin with Kafka,

306
00:18:42.120 --> 00:18:46.860
but don't assume this was some great autumn romance by 1923, Kafka was so sick.

307
00:18:46.860 --> 00:18:50.330
That Dora's role was more that of a live in us than a lover.

308
00:18:50.670 --> 00:18:54.410
She was also Stoney broke. Hyperinflation had ripped Imar Germany,

309
00:18:54.590 --> 00:18:57.570
wiping out Kafka's pension. By November of 1923,

310
00:18:57.790 --> 00:19:00.850
the PA were reduced to using candles to eat their food.

311
00:19:01.220 --> 00:19:06.010
Still Dora's influence was causing Kafka to fill a tiny rev optimism for the

312
00:19:06.011 --> 00:19:09.850
first time in years, he even began making plans to move to Palestine.

313
00:19:10.360 --> 00:19:12.720
But remember, this is the story of France Kafka.

314
00:19:12.740 --> 00:19:16.720
And of course there's no way that fate was going to grant him such happiness.

315
00:19:16.860 --> 00:19:21.520
By early 1924 Kafka's health finally collapsed forced by his doctor to check

316
00:19:21.760 --> 00:19:24.800
into a hospital. Kafka selected a sanatorium outside Vienna,

317
00:19:25.030 --> 00:19:29.360
then gloomily he left Berlin and good as he made his way towards his final

318
00:19:29.390 --> 00:19:32.150
resting place. Kafka found time to stop in Prague.

319
00:19:32.151 --> 00:19:35.870
This was just long enough to give max brought his unfinished manuscripts of the

320
00:19:35.871 --> 00:19:37.790
trial America and the castle,

321
00:19:38.170 --> 00:19:41.150
and asking him to burn them in late March, 1924,

322
00:19:41.240 --> 00:19:43.790
Kafka arrived at the Vienna sanatorium for treatments.

323
00:19:43.880 --> 00:19:48.230
Three months later on June, the third, he died of his illness on his death bed.

324
00:19:48.250 --> 00:19:52.220
He wrote a Dora Diamond's father asking for permission to marrow Dora's father

325
00:19:52.410 --> 00:19:56.020
just cut replied. No, at the time he passed away.

326
00:19:56.620 --> 00:20:00.580
Kafka was a man whose life story seemed to be that of a sickly insurance lawyer

327
00:20:00.600 --> 00:20:03.420
who was unlucky in love and never did anything of note.

328
00:20:03.640 --> 00:20:06.980
His writing was only known by a tiny circle of Prague intellectuals,

329
00:20:07.160 --> 00:20:09.300
and they'd only seen the published stuff.

330
00:20:09.480 --> 00:20:12.650
The bulk of his work had been seen only by Kafka who died.

331
00:20:12.651 --> 00:20:15.170
Having made his best friends, promised burn it all.

332
00:20:15.280 --> 00:20:19.730
Luckily for posterity that best friends just so happened to be Yik consummate

333
00:20:19.880 --> 00:20:20.713
liar.

334
00:20:26.360 --> 00:20:27.193
Many years later,

335
00:20:27.350 --> 00:20:31.130
max broad would reflect on his final meeting with Kafka and offer this

336
00:20:31.131 --> 00:20:31.964
explanation.

337
00:20:32.080 --> 00:20:36.280
According to broad Kafka knew his best friend would never burn his manuscripts.

338
00:20:36.281 --> 00:20:37.800
If he really wanted them destroyed,

339
00:20:37.801 --> 00:20:41.720
he would've asked Doro Herman who've probably burned them with relish.

340
00:20:41.940 --> 00:20:46.560
By asking broad Kafka was in effect asking the one person he knew would ignore

341
00:20:46.580 --> 00:20:49.200
his wishes and try to publish his novels.

342
00:20:49.460 --> 00:20:52.760
And that's exactly what broad did all through the rest of 1924,

343
00:20:53.040 --> 00:20:54.920
brought diligently organized Kafka's papers,

344
00:20:55.320 --> 00:20:58.680
sifting the piles of notes into chapters, grieving them by theme,

345
00:20:58.880 --> 00:21:02.960
figuring out how they might slot into a wider novel. By early 1925,

346
00:21:03.380 --> 00:21:07.150
he was finished that April brought used his literary connect to get the trial

347
00:21:07.151 --> 00:21:07.730
published.

348
00:21:07.730 --> 00:21:11.550
It was well enough received in Europe that the castle followed a year later in

349
00:21:11.551 --> 00:21:15.910
America a year after that, by 1930, all three of Kafka's novels.

350
00:21:15.940 --> 00:21:20.030
Plus his collected short stories were available for European intellectuals to

351
00:21:20.031 --> 00:21:24.070
Marvel like that come 1937. The first English editions even began to appear,

352
00:21:24.450 --> 00:21:29.180
but it would be another decade before the spark really lit after world Wari

353
00:21:29.181 --> 00:21:33.020
publishing houses in America began to take a chance on this long dead author,

354
00:21:33.130 --> 00:21:35.220
because they were hearing so much about him.

355
00:21:35.240 --> 00:21:38.100
People like NAOC saying his praises below the border,

356
00:21:38.420 --> 00:21:42.500
Southern American writers like Markez and Borje vow his work. And the rest,

357
00:21:42.920 --> 00:21:47.020
as they say is history today, Kafka is one of a handful of writers.

358
00:21:47.930 --> 00:21:51.250
Everyone has heard of an author as recognizable as George Orwell,

359
00:21:51.650 --> 00:21:53.930
Edgar Allen Poe, or HP Lovecraft.

360
00:21:54.270 --> 00:21:56.970
But while all these men were known as writers in their day,

361
00:21:57.040 --> 00:22:01.770
even the underappreciated Lovecraft Kafka is maybe the only one who rose

362
00:22:01.920 --> 00:22:06.730
from complete obscurity and brought such complex unique riches with him.

363
00:22:07.110 --> 00:22:09.520
If you go to prag new Jewish cemetery today,

364
00:22:09.580 --> 00:22:13.960
you can still see the shared grave where Kafka and Herman life

365
00:22:14.160 --> 00:22:15.960
eternity side by side.

366
00:22:16.180 --> 00:22:19.240
But while Kafka may not have been able to escape his abusive father,

367
00:22:19.350 --> 00:22:20.081
even in death,

368
00:22:20.081 --> 00:22:24.440
he has now escaped Herman's judgment because history remembers him not as a

369
00:22:24.441 --> 00:22:26.440
disappointment, but as Fran Kafka,

370
00:22:26.740 --> 00:22:30.150
the writer who changed way that we see the world.

371
00:22:30.730 --> 00:22:32.910
