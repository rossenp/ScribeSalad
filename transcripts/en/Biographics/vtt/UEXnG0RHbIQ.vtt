00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:03.180
<v 0>Kingsbury run is the neighborhoods on the Southeast side of Cleveland,</v>

2
00:00:03.570 --> 00:00:07.080
Ohio whose main feature is a natural watershed that drains into the Cuyahoga

3
00:00:07.081 --> 00:00:10.260
river. During the 1930s, ravaged by the great depression,

4
00:00:10.290 --> 00:00:14.670
the area was mainly full of shantytowns that were homes, transience addicts,

5
00:00:14.671 --> 00:00:18.960
and other vulnerable people condemned to reside on the bottom rung of society.

6
00:00:18.990 --> 00:00:19.621
Unfortunately,

7
00:00:19.621 --> 00:00:23.400
these characteristics also make the easy targets for anyone looking for victims

8
00:00:23.700 --> 00:00:25.830
for you. See, Cleveland's also at a monster.

9
00:00:25.860 --> 00:00:30.390
He was real life flesh and blood like you and me and his Savage actions would

10
00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:35.340
make the make-believe monsters of fairytales pale in comparison, who he was,

11
00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:40.320
why he did what he did. We still don't know he was never identified or captured,

12
00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:43.590
but he left behind a dark legacy that forever Tate did the history of

13
00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:44.281
Cleveland's.

14
00:00:44.281 --> 00:00:49.200
And one that we will explore today as we take a look at the mad butcher of

15
00:00:49.201 --> 00:00:50.034
Kingsbury, right

16
00:01:03.050 --> 00:01:05.690
Began on September the 23rd, 1935,

17
00:01:05.691 --> 00:01:09.740
when two boys were spending a nice sunny afternoon climbing and embankments in

18
00:01:09.741 --> 00:01:12.140
Kingsbury run gold Hill,

19
00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:15.560
the site there's a match to them when they reach the top cause to both discrete

20
00:01:15.890 --> 00:01:18.380
and flee and terrorists searching for the nearest adults.

21
00:01:18.440 --> 00:01:21.920
It was the naked body of a man and he didn't have a hat. Detectives,

22
00:01:21.921 --> 00:01:26.810
Ali may and ML missile were the first to arrive on the scene while investigating

23
00:01:26.811 --> 00:01:29.330
the area. They quickly made another grisly discovery.

24
00:01:29.390 --> 00:01:32.600
There was a second victim who liked the first had also been beheaded,

25
00:01:32.810 --> 00:01:34.340
washed and drained of blood.

26
00:01:34.550 --> 00:01:38.150
The official police report described the scene as such the bodies of two white

27
00:01:38.151 --> 00:01:41.330
men, both beheaded buying in the weeds. Both bodies were naked,

28
00:01:41.720 --> 00:01:44.480
except that one of them had socks on after an extensive search.

29
00:01:44.481 --> 00:01:47.390
The heads of both men were found buried in separate places.

30
00:01:47.450 --> 00:01:50.960
One of our it's 20 feet away from one of the bodies and the other head was

31
00:01:50.961 --> 00:01:53.270
buried about 75 feet away from the other body.

32
00:01:53.390 --> 00:01:57.110
Both men's genitals had been severed from their bodies and were found near one

33
00:01:57.111 --> 00:01:57.770
of the heads.

34
00:01:57.770 --> 00:02:02.360
We also found an old blue coat light cap and the bloodstained union suit

35
00:02:02.450 --> 00:02:06.290
nearby was a metal bucket containing a small quantity of oil and torch.

36
00:02:06.470 --> 00:02:10.370
It was apparent that oil acid or some chemical was poured over one of the bodies

37
00:02:10.371 --> 00:02:12.020
as it was burns, to quite an extent,

38
00:02:12.230 --> 00:02:15.560
it was also evidence that both bodies had been there several days as they had

39
00:02:15.561 --> 00:02:19.280
started decompose. The first victim was named Edward and dressy.

40
00:02:19.310 --> 00:02:21.230
He was a 28 year old, former orderly,

41
00:02:21.260 --> 00:02:24.890
who used to work at the psychiatric wards of Cleveland city hospital.

42
00:02:25.130 --> 00:02:28.550
At the time of his murder though, he was unemployed and his wife had left him.

43
00:02:28.730 --> 00:02:31.790
He ended up being one of the few victims of the mad butcher who wherever

44
00:02:31.791 --> 00:02:34.370
identified the police had his fingerprints on file.

45
00:02:34.520 --> 00:02:37.970
As and dressy had had several run-ins with the law as his father put it Edward

46
00:02:38.060 --> 00:02:41.070
associated with people of questionable character.

47
00:02:41.180 --> 00:02:43.400
He had been arrested once when he concealed weapons,

48
00:02:43.790 --> 00:02:46.460
George and had been picked up for intoxication multiple times.

49
00:02:46.640 --> 00:02:47.840
He dealt in pornography,

50
00:02:48.110 --> 00:02:51.670
the got in trouble with gangsters in Detroit and even had an angry husband out

51
00:02:51.671 --> 00:02:54.800
for blood after sleeping with his wife. In other words,

52
00:02:54.830 --> 00:02:58.610
nobody was really shocked at that. And dressy eventually ended up murdered.

53
00:02:58.670 --> 00:03:01.420
Although the were a bit of a surprise.

54
00:03:01.480 --> 00:03:05.470
The second victim remains an unidentified John DOE or victim one,

55
00:03:05.471 --> 00:03:07.360
as he was referred to in the investigation,

56
00:03:07.390 --> 00:03:10.930
he was a middle aged man between 40 and 45 years of age, about five foot,

57
00:03:10.931 --> 00:03:14.890
six tall, 165 pounds with dark Brown hap.

58
00:03:14.950 --> 00:03:18.820
What was established was that he was the mad bushes likely first victim,

59
00:03:18.850 --> 00:03:19.870
while that would interest,

60
00:03:19.960 --> 00:03:23.110
you had been sitting in the grass for two to three days before he was discovered

61
00:03:23.200 --> 00:03:26.470
initial estimates for John DOE said that he had been murdered some seven to 10

62
00:03:26.471 --> 00:03:28.990
days prior. These estimates were later revised,

63
00:03:28.991 --> 00:03:32.410
even further concluding that he had been killed and dumped weeks before and

64
00:03:32.411 --> 00:03:32.921
dressy.

65
00:03:32.921 --> 00:03:36.760
But the chemical agents that his body was treated with that caused it to become

66
00:03:36.761 --> 00:03:40.810
leathery and slowed down decomposition lab analysis also revealed another grease

67
00:03:40.811 --> 00:03:44.800
in detail. Both men were still alive when they'd been decapitated.

68
00:03:50.790 --> 00:03:51.150
<v 1>[Inaudible].</v>

69
00:03:51.150 --> 00:03:55.010
<v 0>Since then, dressy was the only one of the two victims who was identified.</v>

70
00:03:55.200 --> 00:03:57.870
Police focus their investigation on his last days,

71
00:03:57.960 --> 00:04:01.620
he left his home on Thursday evening and was murdered the following night with

72
00:04:01.770 --> 00:04:04.980
his Bondi being discovered on Monday afternoon. Unfortunately,

73
00:04:04.981 --> 00:04:08.970
detectives couldn't track down anyone who saw or spoke with Andrew Massey after

74
00:04:08.971 --> 00:04:09.804
he left home,

75
00:04:09.840 --> 00:04:13.470
nor could they find any connections to another missing person who could have

76
00:04:13.471 --> 00:04:16.200
been victim one offer a few weeks of investigations.

77
00:04:16.201 --> 00:04:18.900
The authorities reached some conclusions regarding the case.

78
00:04:19.080 --> 00:04:21.090
Both men were killed by the same person.

79
00:04:21.150 --> 00:04:24.630
This person used a sharp knife for the dismemberment and made clean cuts,

80
00:04:24.750 --> 00:04:26.430
showing knowledge and experience.

81
00:04:26.460 --> 00:04:30.660
These were crimes of passion and one related to any criminal rackets.

82
00:04:30.690 --> 00:04:31.980
They were committed somewhere else.

83
00:04:31.981 --> 00:04:35.940
And the victims were brought to Kingsbury run after the fact with the killer

84
00:04:35.970 --> 00:04:40.110
being strong enough to carry the bodies up the steep embankments of Hill as an

85
00:04:40.111 --> 00:04:41.850
automobile could not claim that way.

86
00:04:41.880 --> 00:04:45.180
While this may have had the makings of a decent start for a criminal profile,

87
00:04:45.240 --> 00:04:48.990
it was nowhere near good enough to identify the murder app with no leads to

88
00:04:48.991 --> 00:04:53.700
follow the police. And only one choice wait for another body. As it turns out,

89
00:04:53.730 --> 00:04:57.360
they may have already had it. Traditionally 12 victims are ascribed to the mat,

90
00:04:57.870 --> 00:05:00.180
but some researchers believe that he may have murdered more.

91
00:05:00.181 --> 00:05:04.470
And the first one actually predated the two bodies found on Hill on September

92
00:05:04.471 --> 00:05:05.760
the fifth, 1934,

93
00:05:05.790 --> 00:05:10.140
the lower half of a woman's torso washed up on the shore near Euclid beach park

94
00:05:10.141 --> 00:05:10.974
at Lake Erie.

95
00:05:11.280 --> 00:05:14.790
It's been in the water for three to four months and had an odd coloration,

96
00:05:14.791 --> 00:05:16.860
which resulted from being treated chemically.

97
00:05:16.950 --> 00:05:19.380
Despite the clear similarities police at the time,

98
00:05:19.560 --> 00:05:22.770
never investigated this as part of the med butcher's murders,

99
00:05:22.860 --> 00:05:27.270
the woman was only retroactively named as possibly being the first victim

100
00:05:27.390 --> 00:05:30.900
becoming known as the lady of the Lake or victim zero.

101
00:05:30.960 --> 00:05:33.750
The next murder came in late January, 1936.

102
00:05:33.930 --> 00:05:36.930
There was another woman showing that the mad butcher had no preference when it

103
00:05:36.931 --> 00:05:41.220
came to gender parts of her body had been raft Kathleen's newspaper and left on

104
00:05:41.221 --> 00:05:43.650
the streets and half bushel baskets.

105
00:05:43.800 --> 00:05:46.380
The other parts were found days later in an empty lot,

106
00:05:46.980 --> 00:05:50.100
callously discarded against a fence I had was never recovered,

107
00:05:50.130 --> 00:05:53.700
but she was identified through fingerprints. She was Florence Flo pillow,

108
00:05:53.701 --> 00:05:57.210
a 42 year old waitress who had been arrested at a few times for prostitution.

109
00:05:57.440 --> 00:06:00.680
And also the only other victim apart from and dressy to be positively

110
00:06:00.681 --> 00:06:03.080
identified. Those who knew Flo Lancto.

111
00:06:03.110 --> 00:06:06.590
She was usually friendly and kind exceptions being when she drank heavily,

112
00:06:06.591 --> 00:06:08.960
which apparently happens quite often because of this,

113
00:06:08.990 --> 00:06:12.680
her marriage fell apart and she had to resort to prostitution to make ends meet

114
00:06:12.800 --> 00:06:17.240
like dressy. She mainly surrounded herself with dubious characters like pimps,

115
00:06:17.270 --> 00:06:19.340
madams, bootleggers, and drug addicts.

116
00:06:19.341 --> 00:06:23.000
And none of them could provide police with clues as to what happened to flow

117
00:06:23.001 --> 00:06:24.170
before her disappearance,

118
00:06:24.230 --> 00:06:27.620
the investigation into a death that soon hit a wall like the other sprints,

119
00:06:27.621 --> 00:06:30.260
because the idea of a serial killer was still relatively new.

120
00:06:30.290 --> 00:06:33.800
The authorities were still not treating these murders is the work of the same

121
00:06:34.460 --> 00:06:36.230
culprits because they lacked a common motive.

122
00:06:36.320 --> 00:06:39.440
The two men found on Jack Hill were killed by the same person,

123
00:06:39.441 --> 00:06:42.650
but as far as they were concerned, Flo polo wins.

124
00:06:42.651 --> 00:06:45.050
The lady of the Lake were unconnected crimes.

125
00:06:51.040 --> 00:06:51.130
<v 2>[Inaudible].</v>

126
00:06:51.130 --> 00:06:51.963
<v 0>With no leads.</v>

127
00:06:51.970 --> 00:06:54.970
It was only a matter of time before the killer struck again on the morning of

128
00:06:54.971 --> 00:06:56.470
June, the fifth, 1936,

129
00:06:56.471 --> 00:06:59.860
two boys were passing through Kingsbury run on their way to fishing.

130
00:07:00.010 --> 00:07:02.950
When they saw a pair of pants bunched up and thrown into a Bush,

131
00:07:03.010 --> 00:07:07.390
they prodded it with fishing poles and the head of a man came rolling out the

132
00:07:07.391 --> 00:07:10.600
next day, or authorities found the man's body placed in some bushes,

133
00:07:10.630 --> 00:07:12.760
very close to an office that the railroad police,

134
00:07:13.030 --> 00:07:16.300
whether this was a coincidence or the killer's way of taunting the police.

135
00:07:16.630 --> 00:07:19.510
We don't know the victim was a man in his early to mid twenties,

136
00:07:19.540 --> 00:07:22.630
despite being found near shantytowns. He did not look blank.

137
00:07:22.631 --> 00:07:25.030
He belonged that he was well-groomed clean. Well,

138
00:07:25.390 --> 00:07:27.310
feds had been wearing nice new clothes,

139
00:07:27.311 --> 00:07:30.160
which were dumped in a pile next to his naked body, his underwear,

140
00:07:30.161 --> 00:07:33.190
and had the initials JD on them more distinctly though,

141
00:07:33.220 --> 00:07:34.960
the young man had six tattoos.

142
00:07:34.990 --> 00:07:39.010
Some of them with elements that suggested he might've been a sailor in a very

143
00:07:39.011 --> 00:07:39.820
unusual move.

144
00:07:39.820 --> 00:07:43.450
The police made a death mask of the victim and presented it alongside a chart of

145
00:07:43.451 --> 00:07:46.180
his tattoos and exhibits at the great lakes exposition.

146
00:07:46.240 --> 00:07:47.950
The world's fair that took place in Cleveland,

147
00:07:47.951 --> 00:07:49.420
just a few weeks after the murder,

148
00:07:49.510 --> 00:07:52.750
their thinking was that his face would be seen by hundreds of thousands of

149
00:07:52.751 --> 00:07:55.000
people. And hopefully someone would recognize it.

150
00:07:55.150 --> 00:07:58.300
Unfortunately they had no luck despite the death mask,

151
00:07:58.330 --> 00:08:01.360
despite the tattoos and the initials and the fingerprints,

152
00:08:01.630 --> 00:08:05.440
the victim remained unidentified becoming known as the tattooed man.

153
00:08:05.500 --> 00:08:06.520
Also around this time,

154
00:08:06.521 --> 00:08:10.090
the police were increasingly becoming forced to face an unpleasant reality.

155
00:08:10.091 --> 00:08:10.540
This,

156
00:08:10.540 --> 00:08:14.110
there was a single madman in Cleveland who was killing all of these people by

157
00:08:14.111 --> 00:08:15.160
cutting their heads off.

158
00:08:15.250 --> 00:08:18.070
It was the coroner's office that first took this position,

159
00:08:18.130 --> 00:08:20.560
the decapitations that precision of the cops,

160
00:08:20.561 --> 00:08:24.520
the cleaning and disposing of the bodies. They all suggested one culprits.

161
00:08:24.730 --> 00:08:25.720
However, again,

162
00:08:25.750 --> 00:08:30.040
serial killers were still a novel concept back then one that the investigators

163
00:08:30.041 --> 00:08:32.890
led by Sergeant James Hogan, head of the homicide division,

164
00:08:33.100 --> 00:08:36.760
either didn't consider or more likely preferred to ignore.

165
00:08:36.820 --> 00:08:39.520
They wanted them murders to fall into neat little boxes.

166
00:08:39.550 --> 00:08:43.120
The two men found dead on Jack ourselves. A woman had to be involved.

167
00:08:43.121 --> 00:08:47.320
Somehow the bodies dumped near shantytowns clearly part of some kind of criminal

168
00:08:47.321 --> 00:08:49.270
activity like drugs or prostitution.

169
00:08:49.630 --> 00:08:53.660
It was with extreme reluctance that they finally admitted that the crimes were

170
00:08:53.661 --> 00:08:58.110
all the work of one crazed killer persuaded by a man with an untouchable

171
00:08:58.111 --> 00:08:58.944
character.

172
00:09:04.940 --> 00:09:08.000
Undoubtedly, as if the gruesomeness of the murders wasn't enough.

173
00:09:08.150 --> 00:09:09.260
Another element of fan,

174
00:09:09.261 --> 00:09:12.170
the flames of public interest was the involvement of Elliot ness,

175
00:09:12.560 --> 00:09:15.950
former prohibition agents, and leader of the untouchables. By this point,

176
00:09:15.951 --> 00:09:19.340
he was already famous in the country for his role in taking down Al Capone in

177
00:09:19.341 --> 00:09:22.130
Chicago, even though he was still in his early thirties.

178
00:09:22.131 --> 00:09:25.280
And this was clearly regarded as the new up-and-coming golden bike.

179
00:09:25.490 --> 00:09:28.220
Once prohibition ended Cleveland's mayor Harold Burton,

180
00:09:28.760 --> 00:09:30.230
hardened as the city's safety director,

181
00:09:30.440 --> 00:09:33.050
giving him authority over the police and fire departments.

182
00:09:33.410 --> 00:09:36.860
Burton himself had been elected on a platform of cracking down on crime and

183
00:09:36.861 --> 00:09:40.970
corruption. So obviously nobody fit the role better than Elliot nest.

184
00:09:41.090 --> 00:09:43.760
This happened in December, 1935, by which point,

185
00:09:43.761 --> 00:09:47.000
the mad butcher already claimed several victims that were still being

186
00:09:47.001 --> 00:09:50.720
investigated as separate murders because of alienness as high profile.

187
00:09:50.780 --> 00:09:54.140
His involvement in the torso murders had been exaggerated over the years.

188
00:09:54.380 --> 00:09:56.480
His position was mainly administrative.

189
00:09:56.550 --> 00:09:58.760
He rarely took an active role in the case,

190
00:09:58.820 --> 00:10:02.570
not to mention the fact that his focus was on tackling large scale issues,

191
00:10:02.571 --> 00:10:06.950
such as corruption, drugs, and gambling, not one lunatic with a knife, even.

192
00:10:06.951 --> 00:10:11.240
So he was persuaded by the coroner that the beheadings or the work of just one

193
00:10:11.241 --> 00:10:15.260
man and instructed the homicide division to investigate the crimes as being

194
00:10:15.261 --> 00:10:17.660
committed by a single killer. In the meantime,

195
00:10:17.690 --> 00:10:21.950
the murderer continue to spree unimpeded and other male victim was found just a

196
00:10:21.951 --> 00:10:23.750
month and a half after the tattooed man.

197
00:10:23.751 --> 00:10:27.650
Although he had actually been killed months before he was in an advanced state

198
00:10:27.651 --> 00:10:31.160
of decomposition and remained on identified because there were two unique

199
00:10:31.161 --> 00:10:32.960
elements about this crime. One,

200
00:10:33.200 --> 00:10:36.950
it occurred in the big Creek area in Southwest Cleveland's, far removed trimmed,

201
00:10:37.490 --> 00:10:38.420
Kingsbury run two,

202
00:10:38.450 --> 00:10:41.900
there was a large puddle of dried blood under the corpse that was wet.

203
00:10:41.930 --> 00:10:43.010
He had been murdered as well.

204
00:10:43.190 --> 00:10:45.860
The other victims that all been dumped in different location.

205
00:10:45.950 --> 00:10:49.250
For some reason that we still don't know on this particular occasion,

206
00:10:49.251 --> 00:10:52.400
the killer straight pretty far from his original modus operandi.

207
00:10:52.401 --> 00:10:56.540
Although ultimately it did not yield any useful leads to the authorities.

208
00:10:56.630 --> 00:10:58.810
By this point, the police were looking for one murder,

209
00:10:58.820 --> 00:11:02.230
but the press and the people did not know that. Yes, even those.

210
00:11:02.360 --> 00:11:03.290
Then when you say the headlines,

211
00:11:03.291 --> 00:11:07.820
which speculated that the city had a madman whose strange God is the guillotine

212
00:11:07.850 --> 00:11:11.240
for the moments Elliot ness was providing them with all the headlines and

213
00:11:11.241 --> 00:11:15.650
snapshots they needed by staging raids on gambling dens and taking down corrupt

214
00:11:15.651 --> 00:11:16.550
officials. However,

215
00:11:16.551 --> 00:11:20.900
the next victim alerted the entire nation that Cleveland at a serial killer at

216
00:11:20.901 --> 00:11:24.290
its midst, the body was found on September the 10th, 1936,

217
00:11:24.291 --> 00:11:28.250
when a Vagrant saw two halves of a torso floating in a stagnant pool of water by

218
00:11:28.251 --> 00:11:32.630
the Creek police and rescue unit soon arrived on the scene and use long hooks to

219
00:11:32.631 --> 00:11:35.780
try and recover other parts of the body and items of clothing.

220
00:11:35.960 --> 00:11:39.200
As the hours passed, hundreds of onlookers gathered to see the morbid show,

221
00:11:39.410 --> 00:11:42.440
the media then arrived to ask questions and take pictures.

222
00:11:42.470 --> 00:11:45.650
There was no way it's a hyper story of the torso murders anymore.

223
00:11:45.890 --> 00:11:48.710
Soon enough papers even had a name for the killer.

224
00:11:49.040 --> 00:11:52.940
The man Kingsbury run from this point on Elliot ness,

225
00:11:53.380 --> 00:11:54.520
more involved in the case,

226
00:11:54.521 --> 00:11:58.690
something which she kind of resented since it wasn't what he signed up for him

227
00:11:58.691 --> 00:12:01.750
because it took him away from his other duties where he was markedly more

228
00:12:01.751 --> 00:12:02.530
successful.

229
00:12:02.530 --> 00:12:06.010
Although nowadays he is famous for his work as a prohibition agent against Al

230
00:12:06.011 --> 00:12:07.300
Capone. Thanks to the book,

231
00:12:07.330 --> 00:12:10.990
the TV series and the movie called the untouchables and his own time.

232
00:12:10.991 --> 00:12:14.890
This success faded from public memory and he became chiefly remembered for his

233
00:12:15.070 --> 00:12:17.860
failure to catch the mad bookshop in his position.

234
00:12:17.890 --> 00:12:21.730
There was little that NES could do other than dedicate more resources to the

235
00:12:21.731 --> 00:12:22.360
case.

236
00:12:22.360 --> 00:12:25.870
You assigned a unit of 20 detectives working full time to catch the killer plus

237
00:12:25.900 --> 00:12:28.870
countless patrolman. He told them to investigate every tip,

238
00:12:28.900 --> 00:12:30.730
no matter how trivial or crazy.

239
00:12:30.940 --> 00:12:34.330
And he put out a reward for information leading to the Matt butcher's arrest.

240
00:12:34.420 --> 00:12:38.050
Some of the detectives went undercover as vagrants while others posed as gay men

241
00:12:38.051 --> 00:12:39.340
in bars and steam bars,

242
00:12:39.341 --> 00:12:43.150
hoping that they might lock into the killers hunting grounds of particular note

243
00:12:43.151 --> 00:12:46.660
here was the detective good Peter Marilou. He was considered intelligence,

244
00:12:46.661 --> 00:12:50.590
but eccentric spoke multiple languages and was tenacious in his pursuits

245
00:12:50.710 --> 00:12:52.450
sometimes bordering on obsessive.

246
00:12:52.690 --> 00:12:56.740
He and his partner personally interviewed over 1,500 people for this case,

247
00:12:56.830 --> 00:13:01.180
which included all the stranger suspects whose profiles ended up on that desks

248
00:13:01.240 --> 00:13:04.750
among them was a giant man who walked around Kingsbury run with a kitchen knife.

249
00:13:04.930 --> 00:13:08.740
Another man who claimed he was a voodoo doctor and he possessed a death rate.

250
00:13:08.800 --> 00:13:09.633
And last,

251
00:13:09.640 --> 00:13:14.050
but certainly not least man who liked to hide prostitutes and pleasure himself

252
00:13:14.080 --> 00:13:16.300
while watching them cut heads off chickens.

253
00:13:22.500 --> 00:13:23.130
<v 1>Despite the risks.</v>

254
00:13:23.130 --> 00:13:25.020
<v 0>That's, the police made no headway in their case,</v>

255
00:13:25.140 --> 00:13:27.660
in the mad butcher claims and other three victims. The following year,

256
00:13:27.870 --> 00:13:30.360
the first was a woman found in February,

257
00:13:30.360 --> 00:13:33.840
1937 on the shore of Lake Erie in almost the same spot as the lady of the Lake.

258
00:13:33.870 --> 00:13:35.010
Back in 1934,

259
00:13:35.040 --> 00:13:38.880
the second victim was mostly a skeleton because even though she was found in

260
00:13:38.881 --> 00:13:42.270
June, 1937, she had been killed a year prior, despite this,

261
00:13:42.271 --> 00:13:46.380
she had been officially identified as a missing woman named Rose Wallace,

262
00:13:46.410 --> 00:13:50.100
thanks to our dental work. But again, this didn't lead anywhere promising.

263
00:13:50.190 --> 00:13:53.340
The third and final victim of the year was a man whose headless remains were

264
00:13:53.341 --> 00:13:56.010
pulled out of the Cuyahoga river. A month later,

265
00:13:56.070 --> 00:14:00.240
the last three victims were all found in 1938. They were two women and one man,

266
00:14:00.450 --> 00:14:03.600
all remaining unidentified. The last two were discovered on the same day,

267
00:14:03.601 --> 00:14:06.690
very close to each other, although they'd been killed months apart,

268
00:14:06.840 --> 00:14:10.230
those were the final victims, officially ascribed, the mad butcher buts.

269
00:14:10.250 --> 00:14:13.110
There were thoughts that he simply started killing someplace else.

270
00:14:13.140 --> 00:14:16.410
Whenever a killer stopped, suddenly there are three common possibilities.

271
00:14:16.470 --> 00:14:20.310
They died. They were imprisoned on an unrelated charge or they moved away.

272
00:14:20.400 --> 00:14:21.233
Detective Peter,

273
00:14:21.540 --> 00:14:25.350
Marilyn believed that the mad butcher hopped boxcars and started a new spree in

274
00:14:25.351 --> 00:14:28.860
Pennsylvania. The city of Newcastle Pennsylvania had a swamp nearby,

275
00:14:28.861 --> 00:14:32.370
which had been used ever since the 1920s as a body dumping grounds during the

276
00:14:32.371 --> 00:14:36.660
late 1930s, early 1940s, several headless victims were found at that location.

277
00:14:36.720 --> 00:14:40.560
And people such as Marilou concluded that the so-called murder swamp killer and

278
00:14:40.561 --> 00:14:43.470
the mad butcher of Kingsbury run one on the same.

279
00:14:43.590 --> 00:14:46.590
This claim was investigated by the coroner's office and the police,

280
00:14:46.860 --> 00:14:49.680
but it was never proven. As far as Elliot ness was concerned,

281
00:14:49.681 --> 00:14:53.570
he became distressed and reckless due to mounting public pressure to stop the

282
00:14:53.571 --> 00:14:55.790
killer on August the 18th, 1938,

283
00:14:55.791 --> 00:14:58.070
just two days after the last victims were discovered,

284
00:14:58.370 --> 00:15:01.280
the organized a massive raid on the shantytowns, the Kingsbury run.

285
00:15:01.600 --> 00:15:05.060
He had all the vagrants rounded up and then he burns the police to the grounds

286
00:15:05.061 --> 00:15:06.230
so they could not return.

287
00:15:06.380 --> 00:15:09.920
It was the last act of a desperate man with no other cards to play.

288
00:15:10.430 --> 00:15:13.310
NES was severely condemned in the newspapers for this extreme action.

289
00:15:13.520 --> 00:15:16.400
But the thing is that the mad butcher never struck again.

290
00:15:16.670 --> 00:15:20.030
We're not saying there is any direct correlation between the two.

291
00:15:20.450 --> 00:15:21.283
We're just pointing it out.

292
00:15:27.970 --> 00:15:28.630
<v 3>The man bookshop.</v>

293
00:15:28.630 --> 00:15:29.800
<v 0>I may have alluded capture,</v>

294
00:15:29.830 --> 00:15:33.070
but as far as Elliot nest and a few other detectives were concerned,

295
00:15:33.340 --> 00:15:34.780
they identified the killer.

296
00:15:34.840 --> 00:15:37.720
They were just not able to find evidence to take him to court.

297
00:15:37.810 --> 00:15:41.140
One important talking point during the investigation was the extent of the

298
00:15:41.680 --> 00:15:42.760
murderer's anatomical knowledge.

299
00:15:43.000 --> 00:15:45.460
He always made precise cuts on the bodies of his victims,

300
00:15:45.461 --> 00:15:47.020
knowing exactly where to slice.

301
00:15:47.230 --> 00:15:51.370
So was he someone with medical experience or perhaps someone with more basic

302
00:15:51.371 --> 00:15:55.300
training, like an actual butcher at one point, the coroner working the case,

303
00:15:55.301 --> 00:15:58.960
Dr. Samuel Gerber expressed his belief that the killer was probably a doctor.

304
00:15:58.961 --> 00:16:01.660
So the investigation began to focus on them.

305
00:16:02.160 --> 00:16:04.990
Detectives started looking into medical professionals in Cleveland's with a

306
00:16:05.000 --> 00:16:07.550
history, for any kind of licentious behaviors,

307
00:16:07.551 --> 00:16:11.290
such as arrests for substance abuse. So soliciting prostitutes.

308
00:16:11.350 --> 00:16:13.540
That is how they arrived at Dr. Francis Sweeney.

309
00:16:13.690 --> 00:16:16.630
He was an alcoholic prone to violent outbursts. When he drank,

310
00:16:16.690 --> 00:16:17.740
he grew up in Kingsbury,

311
00:16:18.100 --> 00:16:21.490
rotten and had lost his marriage and his job due to his drinking problem.

312
00:16:21.640 --> 00:16:22.181
Physically,

313
00:16:22.181 --> 00:16:26.410
he fit the profile for the mad butcher because he was very tall and strong on

314
00:16:26.411 --> 00:16:27.310
several occasions.

315
00:16:27.311 --> 00:16:29.920
The killer had to carry the bodies of his victims up steep Hills.

316
00:16:29.921 --> 00:16:33.250
So the police were convinced early on that he had to be a man of imposing

317
00:16:33.251 --> 00:16:35.020
Snapchat. This all seemed promising,

318
00:16:35.021 --> 00:16:37.660
but the investigators that two factors working against them,

319
00:16:37.960 --> 00:16:41.380
one Francis Sweeney was the cousin of a Congressman Martin Sweeney.

320
00:16:41.530 --> 00:16:45.190
The latter was the political opponents of mayor Burton and Elliot Nason

321
00:16:45.430 --> 00:16:48.850
allegedly used his influence to impede the investigation of his cousin.

322
00:16:48.910 --> 00:16:52.360
The second problem was that Sweeney often checked himself into a veteran's

323
00:16:52.361 --> 00:16:53.800
hospital for his alcoholism,

324
00:16:54.070 --> 00:16:57.040
and some of his stays coincided with the mad butchers notice.

325
00:16:57.130 --> 00:16:59.590
This was enough to take focus off Sweeney for a while,

326
00:16:59.591 --> 00:17:02.980
at least until one detective thought to look into the veterans hospital alibi

327
00:17:02.981 --> 00:17:06.130
more closely. He discovered that because Sweeney was a doctor and his,

328
00:17:06.131 --> 00:17:08.380
because he always admitted himself voluntarily.

329
00:17:08.560 --> 00:17:10.750
It was pretty much free to come and go as he pleased.

330
00:17:10.780 --> 00:17:13.210
And nobody kept close tabs on him because of this.

331
00:17:13.211 --> 00:17:15.460
The investigation concentrated on him again,

332
00:17:15.660 --> 00:17:19.900
but never yielded anything solid apart from a failed polygraph test and one

333
00:17:19.920 --> 00:17:23.110
supposedly tense interrogation between ness and Sweeney,

334
00:17:23.350 --> 00:17:26.800
where the former flat-out said that he believed Sweeney was the killer

335
00:17:26.920 --> 00:17:28.930
prompting, the accused to grin from ear to ear,

336
00:17:29.050 --> 00:17:32.950
standing up to show his massive frame, and then simply telling ness,

337
00:17:33.340 --> 00:17:35.500
prove it for reasons. Still unknown today.

338
00:17:35.940 --> 00:17:39.040
Francis weenie began checking into hospitals on a more permanent basis from

339
00:17:39.041 --> 00:17:41.050
August, 1938 until his death.

340
00:17:41.140 --> 00:17:44.620
He moved from hospital to hospital across the country. Then it's on occasion.

341
00:17:44.770 --> 00:17:47.530
He sent rambling postcards study at NES. Again,

342
00:17:47.531 --> 00:17:50.910
this happened shortly after the last of the mad butcher were found.

343
00:17:51.000 --> 00:17:52.560
Although this was pure speculation,

344
00:17:52.561 --> 00:17:55.710
some believed that his family forced him to do it, to stop the murders.

345
00:17:55.711 --> 00:17:58.470
While at the same time avoiding the scandal of a trial.

346
00:17:58.530 --> 00:18:02.580
There was one other note where the suspects a 52 year old brick lad named Frank

347
00:18:03.240 --> 00:18:06.360
[inaudible], who was arrested in 1939 for the murder of Flo polo.

348
00:18:06.390 --> 00:18:08.370
He gave a very strange confession,

349
00:18:08.371 --> 00:18:10.920
which was part rambling part specific details,

350
00:18:11.100 --> 00:18:15.540
which was later insinuated to have been coerced while [inaudible] was in the

351
00:18:15.541 --> 00:18:19.140
custody of the County Sheriff's department. He was later found dead in his cell,

352
00:18:19.290 --> 00:18:22.980
allegedly from hanging himself and as an autopsy revealed numerous bruises and

353
00:18:23.100 --> 00:18:23.940
broken ribs.

354
00:18:24.210 --> 00:18:27.960
Nobody's really sure why the Sheriff's department went so hard at dollars all

355
00:18:27.961 --> 00:18:29.220
with almost no evidence,

356
00:18:29.370 --> 00:18:33.120
some even floated the idea that they were under orders from someone higher up

357
00:18:33.121 --> 00:18:37.290
the food chain who wanted another suspect other than the Francis Sweeney. Well,

358
00:18:37.320 --> 00:18:39.060
if that's true, they didn't get it.

359
00:18:39.120 --> 00:18:42.610
Nobody else seriously bought dollars all as a suspect for the mad butcher.

360
00:18:42.900 --> 00:18:47.220
Even his so-called confession only admitted to killing Flo polo in self-defense.

361
00:18:47.221 --> 00:18:48.780
When she attacked him with a knife,

362
00:18:48.900 --> 00:18:52.740
the investigation lost steam pretty soon after the murders stopped Elliot ness

363
00:18:52.890 --> 00:18:55.890
and many men on his team had no doubts that Sweeney was their killer.

364
00:18:56.130 --> 00:18:59.580
So apart from keeping tabs on him, they moved on to new cases.

365
00:18:59.730 --> 00:19:03.240
Others like Peter Marinello kept investigating the possibility that the killer

366
00:19:03.241 --> 00:19:06.660
launched another murder spree in a different city as the years.

367
00:19:06.661 --> 00:19:10.350
And then the decades pass the Cleveland torso murders became increasingly

368
00:19:10.351 --> 00:19:11.640
forgotten. For some reason,

369
00:19:11.641 --> 00:19:14.940
the mad butcher didn't enjoy the same everlasting infamy,

370
00:19:14.970 --> 00:19:18.960
like other unidentified killers, such as Jack, the ripper or the Zodiac,

371
00:19:19.080 --> 00:19:22.110
but he did end up local law. And as Cleveland's most new.

372
00:19:22.610 --> 00:19:23.443
<v 4>Korea's murderer.</v>
