Johnny Versace was a brilliant businessman who took his humble beginnings and

4
00:00:18.721 --> 00:00:21.590
built a multibillion dollar fashion. APA.

5
00:00:21.730 --> 00:00:25.910
He became a celebrity designer in his company's famous mid USEA logo is

6
00:00:26.150 --> 00:00:29.030
recognized around the worlds, but in 1997,

7
00:00:29.330 --> 00:00:34.030
his life was cut short when he became the victim of a serial killer on

8
00:00:34.031 --> 00:00:34.990
today's biographics.

9
00:00:34.991 --> 00:00:39.110
We are gonna tell the inspiring story of Gianni of Versace's rags to riches

10
00:00:39.111 --> 00:00:43.340
success story, as well as shocking twist that tendered his life.

11
00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:54.180
Jon Versace was born on December the 2/19/46 in reg collab,

12
00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:55.260
Bria in Italy,

13
00:00:55.380 --> 00:00:58.380
D there are some Italian pronunciations I'm trying my best with these things.

14
00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:02.010
Look them up when I can. It is what it is. He had two oldest siblings,

15
00:01:02.090 --> 00:01:05.690
a brother named San and a sister named Francesca his parents.

16
00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:07.490
They ran a dress making business.

17
00:01:07.550 --> 00:01:11.850
His father handled the sales while his mother managed their stuff with sewing

18
00:01:11.950 --> 00:01:13.410
and assembly tragically.

19
00:01:13.550 --> 00:01:17.930
His older sister Francesca died at 12 years old from tetanus infection that had

20
00:01:17.931 --> 00:01:19.370
gone untreated, but he was 10.

21
00:01:19.510 --> 00:01:22.960
His parents decided to have another child and his youngest, his to Donna teller,

22
00:01:23.140 --> 00:01:25.960
she was born Johnny treasured, baby Donna teller.

23
00:01:25.961 --> 00:01:29.200
And they would grow up to become best friends. All his life.

24
00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:31.680
Johnny Versace loved classical music and opera,

25
00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:34.720
and he had a dream of becoming a professional composer. However,

26
00:01:35.020 --> 00:01:38.720
his parents needed help around the dress shop and he was forced to give up his

27
00:01:38.721 --> 00:01:43.390
dream in order to enter the family business. He learned how to like fabrics,

28
00:01:43.410 --> 00:01:48.110
how to sew, how to sketch and even create dress patterns for new designs.

29
00:01:48.130 --> 00:01:51.350
During this apprenticeship, Gianni paid close attention to his parents.

30
00:01:51.740 --> 00:01:53.990
They knew how to make their clients feel comfortable.

31
00:01:54.310 --> 00:01:56.830
And when these women looked in the mirror with their new dresses,

32
00:01:57.010 --> 00:02:01.790
his mother made sure that they felt like they were the most important person in

33
00:02:01.791 --> 00:02:05.020
the room. Since his parents were both so busy running this family business,

34
00:02:05.021 --> 00:02:07.460
he spent a lot of time babysitting Donna teller.

35
00:02:07.900 --> 00:02:10.700
One day G took his sister to visit the Roman Coliseum.

36
00:02:10.850 --> 00:02:15.020
This is when he came face to face with a statue of Medusa.

37
00:02:15.080 --> 00:02:19.860
He was entranced by this terrifying woman with hair made SN snakes in school for

38
00:02:20.180 --> 00:02:21.540
Sathi. He was studying Greek and Latin,

39
00:02:21.640 --> 00:02:25.290
and he began to learn more about the original mythology of MedU.

40
00:02:25.510 --> 00:02:26.810
He didn't know it at the time,

41
00:02:27.070 --> 00:02:31.970
but this legends would eventually make a huge impact on his future company.

42
00:02:32.310 --> 00:02:32.531
Now,

43
00:02:32.531 --> 00:02:37.050
most people know the legends of the monster whose eyes could make men turn to

44
00:02:37.051 --> 00:02:37.380
stone.

45
00:02:37.380 --> 00:02:42.050
Maybe you already know the story of Perseus who chopped off her head and used it

46
00:02:42.070 --> 00:02:43.690
as his own personal shields.

47
00:02:43.750 --> 00:02:48.680
But Yu's backstory is actually a whole lot more complicated than this Medusa

48
00:02:48.681 --> 00:02:51.160
was born a mortar woman, and she worked in the temple of Athena.

49
00:02:51.161 --> 00:02:55.880
These priestess SWO, a vow of chastity and covered up in modest tap, even.

50
00:02:55.881 --> 00:03:00.400
So Medusa was so beautiful that news about her spread and Athena became

51
00:03:00.510 --> 00:03:04.000
jealous and resentful. The God of the sea beside and lusted.

52
00:03:04.001 --> 00:03:05.360
After Medusa one day,

53
00:03:05.361 --> 00:03:09.480
she was walking along the shore and beside and emerged from the sea to kidnap

54
00:03:09.700 --> 00:03:12.080
her. And then he forced himself upon her.

55
00:03:12.081 --> 00:03:14.320
Instead of acknowledging that she was a victim,

56
00:03:14.500 --> 00:03:19.190
Athena claimed that Medusa was asking for it and had violated her oath of

57
00:03:19.290 --> 00:03:22.590
purity. Athena transformed her into a monster with snakes for her.

58
00:03:22.810 --> 00:03:26.950
Now every time she so much has looked at a man, he would turn to stone,

59
00:03:26.951 --> 00:03:29.710
which guaranteed that she would be alone forever.

60
00:03:29.890 --> 00:03:33.350
The true moral of the story here is apparently that even the gods and not above

61
00:03:33.351 --> 00:03:38.150
petty jealousy, Joly, the Sahi was completely inspired by the story of Medusa.

62
00:03:38.210 --> 00:03:39.700
In most artists to rendering,

63
00:03:39.760 --> 00:03:44.140
she is always either naked or just barely clothed with her great curse though

64
00:03:44.141 --> 00:03:47.740
came great power because there was no way she would ever be attacked by a man.

65
00:03:47.741 --> 00:03:51.460
Again, for Medusa, there was simply no need to dress. Modestly versa.

66
00:03:51.780 --> 00:03:55.500
Sahi would sketch pictures of the kinds of dresses that he imagines Medusa would

67
00:03:55.700 --> 00:03:59.380
wear these clothes. They had bright colors and they showed off a woman's curves.

68
00:03:59.530 --> 00:04:02.770
He carried on this style for the rest of his career. Years later,

69
00:04:02.830 --> 00:04:06.730
the face of NAUC, it became the logo of the Versace brands. Any.

70
00:04:06.860 --> 00:04:07.693
<v 1>Ideas.</v>

71
00:04:11.990 --> 00:04:15.650
<v 0>At age 26 Gian Versache decided that he wanted to take his skills to the next</v>

72
00:04:15.651 --> 00:04:19.930
level, by moving to Milan and in nursing himself in the world of luxury fashion,

73
00:04:20.180 --> 00:04:25.000
he got a job working for a clothing manufacturer named Jenn's while he was under

74
00:04:25.070 --> 00:04:26.000
this company's employment.

75
00:04:26.001 --> 00:04:29.520
He was able to design two of his own lines of ready to wear clothing.

76
00:04:29.690 --> 00:04:31.240
After building this portfolio,

77
00:04:31.340 --> 00:04:36.120
he began working for other well established fashion houses in Italy Sahi he

78
00:04:36.121 --> 00:04:38.080
spent six years living and working in Milan,

79
00:04:38.081 --> 00:04:42.270
gaining valuable experience and networking with people in the fashion industry.

80
00:04:42.490 --> 00:04:46.310
He eventually made a collection of his original pieces and they went on display

81
00:04:46.410 --> 00:04:49.390
at the Palazzo D Permanente art museum.

82
00:04:49.740 --> 00:04:54.430
This exhibit was a smashing success and it got enough inquiries from new

83
00:04:54.431 --> 00:04:59.150
clients so that he could start selling his pieces direct customers in 1978,

84
00:04:59.151 --> 00:05:03.340
when G VII was 32 years old was finally ready to open his first boutique in

85
00:05:03.341 --> 00:05:07.660
Milan's famous via D speaker shopping district per first, his clothing store.

86
00:05:07.760 --> 00:05:11.100
It was just a single rack of dresses. And yet his talent.

87
00:05:11.360 --> 00:05:14.580
It was still enough to have women coming in to see his creations.

88
00:05:14.910 --> 00:05:19.380
Milan is one of the fashion capitals of the world. You probably know that.

89
00:05:19.400 --> 00:05:20.181
So yeah,

90
00:05:20.181 --> 00:05:24.290
the competition there is pretty this designers open boutiques all the time.

91
00:05:24.560 --> 00:05:27.490
Only for them to never turn a profit since yet, Versace,

92
00:05:27.910 --> 00:05:31.410
he had the skills to push through in order to be successful in just about any

93
00:05:31.650 --> 00:05:34.170
business, not just fashion, you have to understand your customer,

94
00:05:34.350 --> 00:05:37.690
who are they and what do they need to make their life better for Gianni Versace.

95
00:05:37.750 --> 00:05:40.930
He wanted to design clothes for men and women who were sexy, confident,

96
00:05:41.150 --> 00:05:42.680
and powerful. And to him,

97
00:05:42.940 --> 00:05:46.720
the only person who exemplified all of the qualities was his younger sister,

98
00:05:46.810 --> 00:05:47.540
Donna tele.

99
00:05:47.540 --> 00:05:51.520
She had a keen eye for style and she was not afraid to share her criticism of

100
00:05:51.521 --> 00:05:54.680
her older brother's work. When Giani designed something that was ugly.

101
00:05:54.681 --> 00:05:58.040
Donna Tello would tell him that it was ugly almost immediately.

102
00:05:58.041 --> 00:06:01.040
Eventually G learns Donna Tell's tasting clothing,

103
00:06:01.100 --> 00:06:03.640
and she became his muse in interviews.

104
00:06:03.800 --> 00:06:08.080
Johnny shared how much Donna teller inspired him saying she is my first

105
00:06:08.480 --> 00:06:11.840
customer, but Donna teller, wasn't just his artistic inspiration.

106
00:06:12.080 --> 00:06:16.000
G made her the vice president of the corporation when she was still in a early

107
00:06:16.360 --> 00:06:18.670
20 and his older brother send was the presidents,

108
00:06:18.740 --> 00:06:20.710
even though she was technically vice president,

109
00:06:21.110 --> 00:06:24.190
Donna teller was still very young and she was figuring out what she really

110
00:06:24.191 --> 00:06:26.270
wanted to do with her life. Ultimately,

111
00:06:26.410 --> 00:06:29.030
she decided that she wanted to be a fashion designer as well.

112
00:06:29.170 --> 00:06:33.510
So Gianni started a second brands called versus which existed as a

113
00:06:34.190 --> 00:06:36.150
subsidiary of the larger Versai corporation.

114
00:06:36.360 --> 00:06:38.540
Donna tell did all of the designs for this company.

115
00:06:38.560 --> 00:06:41.660
And she began to learn the ins and outs of the fashion business,

116
00:06:41.930 --> 00:06:46.340
just like GI had when he was working for others in Milan to the untrained diet.

117
00:06:46.340 --> 00:06:51.180
Someone might look at the Versace family's designs and assume that not much

118
00:06:51.181 --> 00:06:54.660
thought when, since it at all, many people have even gone.

119
00:06:54.760 --> 00:06:57.340
As far as to say that they are overly sexualized,

120
00:06:57.530 --> 00:07:01.370
whole point of the fashion line was to exploit women's bodies. Indeed.

121
00:07:01.390 --> 00:07:05.250
He got a lot of pushback. People said that his dresses, they were too vulgar.

122
00:07:05.490 --> 00:07:08.970
A phrase actually became famous that red Armani dresses, the wife,

123
00:07:09.280 --> 00:07:10.530
Versace dresses,

124
00:07:10.531 --> 00:07:14.410
the mistres during an interview with Charlie rose Versace responded to these

125
00:07:14.411 --> 00:07:17.970
criticisms with a quote from Fredrick NCHE. Those who know the,

126
00:07:18.280 --> 00:07:20.400
that they are profound strive for clarity,

127
00:07:20.900 --> 00:07:25.040
as in he has the ability to design anything he wants and he could do it well,

128
00:07:25.180 --> 00:07:28.800
but he was choosing to design this way for a very good reason.

129
00:07:29.520 --> 00:07:32.800
Versace hated the fact that somewhere along the course of human history,

130
00:07:32.801 --> 00:07:37.280
it was decided that men were expected to wear a suit and a tie and everything

131
00:07:37.281 --> 00:07:41.670
else was deemed to be unprofessional. And for women with beautiful bodies,

132
00:07:41.700 --> 00:07:44.590
they had to hide them all away in order to be taken seriously.

133
00:07:44.770 --> 00:07:48.310
He knew that many people out there wanted to express themselves through fashion

134
00:07:48.410 --> 00:07:52.150
and they were holding back from going outside of the box because they were

135
00:07:52.151 --> 00:07:55.310
afraid of being judged. He said, don't be into trends.

136
00:07:55.720 --> 00:07:59.740
Don't make fashion own you, but you decide what you are,

137
00:08:00.010 --> 00:08:04.140
what you want to express by the way you dress and the way to live

138
00:08:11.180 --> 00:08:12.580
Combines with his visionary fashion sense.

139
00:08:12.581 --> 00:08:14.380
Versa essentially was also a brilliant businessman.

140
00:08:14.440 --> 00:08:18.060
At the time older fashion brands weren't bothering to head to Eastern countries.

141
00:08:18.061 --> 00:08:21.810
They were trying to focus on the wet where they believed most of the money was

142
00:08:22.290 --> 00:08:27.170
Versace opens up his first shop in China in 1979. Now hindsight is always 2020,

143
00:08:27.171 --> 00:08:27.710
of course,

144
00:08:27.710 --> 00:08:32.010
but we know today that establishing himself in China was an incredibly smart

145
00:08:32.011 --> 00:08:34.930
move. He was 10 steps ahead of the competition on this one.

146
00:08:35.110 --> 00:08:39.890
Now in the 1980s and 19 S Johnny Versace continued to open more of his shops

147
00:08:40.080 --> 00:08:43.200
around the worlds and his designs. They became really, really famous.

148
00:08:43.380 --> 00:08:47.280
He began to dress some of the biggest celebrities in the world at the time, uh,

149
00:08:47.370 --> 00:08:51.720
Elton John princess, Diana Acher, Madonna, all wearing Versace, honestly.

150
00:08:51.721 --> 00:08:51.921
I mean,

151
00:08:51.921 --> 00:08:55.080
there are so many celebrity clients that Versace works with that we couldn't

152
00:08:55.160 --> 00:08:57.400
really possibly mention them all in this video.

153
00:08:57.540 --> 00:09:00.000
He even designed the costumes for an opera called capric.

154
00:09:00.380 --> 00:09:02.200
So even though he was not able to be a composer,

155
00:09:02.201 --> 00:09:05.400
he was still able to keep his love of music in his life by dressing both

156
00:09:05.401 --> 00:09:09.360
classical singers and rock stars alike, getting celebrity endorsements,

157
00:09:09.640 --> 00:09:11.240
they're critical for a business like Versaces,

158
00:09:11.260 --> 00:09:15.070
but it can sometimes just be a bit of a fashion. The pan,

159
00:09:15.120 --> 00:09:17.510
especially in the fashion world, Archie,

160
00:09:17.650 --> 00:09:21.070
he was smart enough to know that in order for his company to last for future

161
00:09:21.100 --> 00:09:25.350
generations, it needed longevity. Now we aren't gonna name names here,

162
00:09:25.351 --> 00:09:28.830
but there are some luxury fashion companies out there that have a rather

163
00:09:29.150 --> 00:09:31.750
snobbish attitude about who they want their ideal customer to be.

164
00:09:31.751 --> 00:09:34.910
They refuse to make products that are affordable to the middle class because

165
00:09:35.250 --> 00:09:37.980
they only want the richest people to represent them.

166
00:09:38.050 --> 00:09:41.580
Some luxury brands actually burn their products because they would rather

167
00:09:41.650 --> 00:09:44.140
destroy those pieces than ever put them on clearance,

168
00:09:44.141 --> 00:09:48.620
which would allow mayor peasants to be able to afford their brand that would

169
00:09:48.830 --> 00:09:52.620
never ever do. Of course, for Versace though, he felt the opposite.

170
00:09:52.760 --> 00:09:55.890
He wanted to make his brands more accessible to a wider or audience.

171
00:09:55.910 --> 00:09:58.330
And he knew that by opening it up to anyone,

172
00:09:58.430 --> 00:10:01.170
it would ultimately make the company more successful.

173
00:10:01.310 --> 00:10:04.930
So we began to sell smaller luxury accessories, like jewelry, wallets,

174
00:10:05.090 --> 00:10:07.210
and perfume and home decorat items.

175
00:10:07.730 --> 00:10:10.930
While some luxury brands cost thousands of dollars for a purse or a dress,

176
00:10:10.931 --> 00:10:15.650
someone can buy over searchy piece for just a few hundred dollars in turn is

177
00:10:15.651 --> 00:10:18.240
brands and de a logo was seen by more people.

178
00:10:18.420 --> 00:10:20.880
And it's almost needless to say at this point in the video that yes,

179
00:10:20.940 --> 00:10:22.640
he was really, really rich by this point,

180
00:10:22.660 --> 00:10:26.560
but maybe not quite a billionaire and you can absolutely bet that he stayed that

181
00:10:26.561 --> 00:10:26.681
way.

182
00:10:26.681 --> 00:10:29.360
You see the jacket that I'm building on the screen right now that jacket costs

183
00:10:29.361 --> 00:10:30.920
355 pounds.

184
00:10:30.920 --> 00:10:35.040
That's 450 American dollars for my American friends.

185
00:10:35.140 --> 00:10:38.870
And that is for something that your kid will probably stop wearing in like a

186
00:10:38.871 --> 00:10:41.390
year. I have no idea how fast kids grow,

187
00:10:41.490 --> 00:10:44.350
not exactly a surprise that he is super rich, but you know,

188
00:10:44.380 --> 00:10:46.110
that jacket is absolutely perfect for you.

189
00:10:46.111 --> 00:10:49.830
If you want your kids who look like a curtain from my grandma's house. Okay?

190
00:10:49.850 --> 00:10:52.630
So the real thing you should be doing is spending your money somewhere else,

191
00:10:52.631 --> 00:10:56.870
somewhere smart, somewhere, it all last somewhere you can enjoy every day.

192
00:10:57.360 --> 00:11:00.460
And that brings me to today sponsor Viero watches.

193
00:11:00.461 --> 00:11:04.140
This was a watch that I was really worried would look kind of bad on my tiny

194
00:11:04.160 --> 00:11:07.620
little baby wrists, but I actually think it looks pretty cool.

195
00:11:07.780 --> 00:11:10.940
I thought I would have to just show you some B roll of someone with adult sized

196
00:11:10.941 --> 00:11:13.420
wrists wearing this watch, but I think I can actually pull it off,

197
00:11:13.421 --> 00:11:17.020
which is cool. I did not expect that. Also it comes with this rubber strap,

198
00:11:17.021 --> 00:11:20.570
which, uh, over in Europe right now is the end of June when I'm recording this.

199
00:11:20.590 --> 00:11:24.490
And there is a mega heat wave going on. It's like 40 degrees, a leather strap.

200
00:11:24.491 --> 00:11:26.250
Doesn't do so well with sweat,

201
00:11:26.350 --> 00:11:28.890
but fortunately you can just swap it out for a rubber one.

202
00:11:28.891 --> 00:11:32.130
If you want like that I'm wearing, uh, like the one I'm wearing right here.

203
00:11:32.630 --> 00:11:37.010
And speaking of that, you can actually swap out these straps on Viera watches.

204
00:11:37.520 --> 00:11:41.560
This is, it's a very nice unboxing experience, by the way.

205
00:11:42.180 --> 00:11:44.440
And in here in here,

206
00:11:44.490 --> 00:11:48.600
there is another strap and this is of course made outta leather.

207
00:11:48.840 --> 00:11:52.240
Let me just put that down and then you could just pop this on, um,

208
00:11:52.460 --> 00:11:56.760
on another Viero watch if you, uh, if you want the leather look and I,

209
00:11:56.840 --> 00:12:00.760
I think like straps are a fantastic way to give a, watch a whole new look.

210
00:12:00.860 --> 00:12:03.000
So don't underestimate the straps.

211
00:12:03.001 --> 00:12:06.800
You can pick those up as well at Viero swap them out when you're ready to.

212
00:12:06.940 --> 00:12:11.560
And my thoughts on watches are sort of like their universal jewelry, the men.

213
00:12:12.120 --> 00:12:15.870
Uh, however, I think Viero, they've probably got a better tagline. Uh,

214
00:12:16.340 --> 00:12:19.350
it's all about a classic look on the watch. Uh,

215
00:12:19.351 --> 00:12:22.070
always being delivered at an amazing price.

216
00:12:22.130 --> 00:12:24.990
So getting a Venter watch is the way to go.

217
00:12:25.020 --> 00:12:28.550
It's the way it's also a way to support this show, which is cool of you.

cuz it really does support us and let's get back to Versace

224
00:12:52.520 --> 00:12:57.290
In 1982, versa she's fashion business. It was absolutely in full swing.

225
00:12:57.430 --> 00:13:01.610
It was at this point that he fell in love with a fashion model named Antonio de

226
00:13:02.090 --> 00:13:04.250
Amico gay marriage. It was not legal at the time,

227
00:13:04.390 --> 00:13:06.650
but they were life partners for 15 years,

228
00:13:07.370 --> 00:13:10.330
Damco and Versace would spend time in Milan and they would travel around the

229
00:13:10.331 --> 00:13:14.280
world together in 1992, they were on a flight to Cuba and it had a lay of, uh,

230
00:13:14.281 --> 00:13:15.114
in Miami.

231
00:13:15.200 --> 00:13:18.960
Johnny asked their driver to bring him and Antonio arounds just to see what

232
00:13:18.961 --> 00:13:22.640
Miami was like. Once he saw it, he was shocked by how beautiful it was.

233
00:13:22.660 --> 00:13:26.240
And he knew that it accidentally found the location of his new home.

234
00:13:26.290 --> 00:13:28.960
After visiting an area of Miami called south beach,

235
00:13:29.100 --> 00:13:33.360
he saw there a community of young gay men who were not afraid to show who they

236
00:13:33.370 --> 00:13:34.910
truly were grow in Europe.

237
00:13:34.910 --> 00:13:37.150
This level of honesty and freedom to live outta the closet.

238
00:13:37.210 --> 00:13:41.750
It was pretty refreshing to Versace and he was convinced that this was truly the

239
00:13:41.751 --> 00:13:45.190
perfect place for him and ACO to live. As he was walking along the beach,

240
00:13:45.191 --> 00:13:49.990
Versace spotted a large Mediterranean revival star mansion with a statue of the

241
00:13:49.991 --> 00:13:52.750
goddess of love. Alfred died. He sitting in the front courtyard,

242
00:13:52.970 --> 00:13:55.980
he was still a die hard mythology deep down, of course.

243
00:13:56.040 --> 00:13:57.700
So once he saw one of his favorite characters,

244
00:13:57.701 --> 00:14:02.060
he saw this as a sign that this was going to be his future home with deco.

245
00:14:02.120 --> 00:14:05.180
He bought the home and he named it LA CASAA Casa arena.

246
00:14:05.440 --> 00:14:09.580
The home is truly a slice of Italy sitting right in the middle of Miami,

247
00:14:09.930 --> 00:14:13.300
even though he was now in his late forties and settled into his forever home GI

248
00:14:13.780 --> 00:14:15.460
facade, he was far from retirement.

249
00:14:15.670 --> 00:14:18.810
He still loved running his business and he was eager to continue improving his

250
00:14:18.811 --> 00:14:23.490
designs. During an interview, he once said, he's like to oxygen from in fashion.

251
00:14:23.690 --> 00:14:24.530
I love doing fashion.

252
00:14:24.870 --> 00:14:28.770
He understood that what his popular in fashion today might change by tomorrow.

253
00:14:29.110 --> 00:14:32.570
So he would therefore frequent Miami nightclubs instead of dancing in the crowd.

254
00:14:32.630 --> 00:14:35.890
He often sat on the sidelines so that he could pay attention and study these

255
00:14:36.080 --> 00:14:39.920
young, beautiful people. According to, to Amaco versa. Sahi never drank alcohol,

256
00:14:39.950 --> 00:14:43.640
even in this social setting because he wanted to stay sober in order to be truly

257
00:14:43.641 --> 00:14:44.474
present in the moment.

258
00:14:44.840 --> 00:14:47.640
Everyone in that local community began to recognize and respect him.

259
00:14:47.710 --> 00:14:50.960
Some say that he was the unofficial mayor of south beach,

260
00:14:51.470 --> 00:14:55.120
even though everyone in his personal life knew about his sexual orientation,

261
00:14:55.121 --> 00:14:56.720
Versace still kept it a secret.

262
00:14:56.900 --> 00:15:00.120
He and Donna teller had been considering taking the company public on the stock

263
00:15:00.121 --> 00:15:03.920
market and they were afraid that shareholders would not want to invest if they

264
00:15:03.921 --> 00:15:05.800
knew that he was gay. But in 1995,

265
00:15:06.240 --> 00:15:08.680
Johnny Versace made the decision to finally come outta the closet.

266
00:15:08.820 --> 00:15:12.470
He publicly announced that he was gay and had been in a long term relationship

267
00:15:12.471 --> 00:15:14.910
with Antonio ACO, Johnny Versace.

268
00:15:15.070 --> 00:15:18.510
He was a truly modest man and he never acted as if he was better than anyone

269
00:15:18.511 --> 00:15:21.630
else living in Miami. And even after he had reached a level of celebrity,

270
00:15:21.930 --> 00:15:22.950
he still kept that way.

271
00:15:23.050 --> 00:15:26.470
He continued spending time outs in the world among normal people while his

272
00:15:26.471 --> 00:15:27.830
mindset was admirable,

273
00:15:28.510 --> 00:15:32.540
what it would turn out to be a tragic mistake in July of 1997,

274
00:15:32.541 --> 00:15:36.620
Versace was now 50 years old. His designs were on the covers of magazines.

275
00:15:36.621 --> 00:15:38.660
He had been on TV on multiple occasions.

276
00:15:39.060 --> 00:15:40.420
Everyone knew that he was a multimillionaire,

277
00:15:40.421 --> 00:15:43.580
but he still ran his own errands around town. Just like anyone else versa.

278
00:15:43.880 --> 00:15:44.940
He was well loved in Miami,

279
00:15:44.941 --> 00:15:47.780
always saying hello and being friendly towards the locals.

280
00:15:47.780 --> 00:15:49.540
According to Antonio to Amico,

281
00:15:49.541 --> 00:15:52.810
Versace was always willing to help other people and described him as being one

282
00:15:52.811 --> 00:15:56.210
of the sweetest men who ever lived the reality was that he didn't make any

283
00:15:56.211 --> 00:15:58.050
enemies. And he felt truly safe.

284
00:15:58.060 --> 00:16:02.130
Ironically Forat often told his friends that he believed that America was a lot

285
00:16:02.131 --> 00:16:02.931
safer than Italy.

286
00:16:02.931 --> 00:16:06.730
This was mainly because the mafia reigned in its hometown on the morning of

287
00:16:06.731 --> 00:16:08.370
July, the 15th, 1997,

288
00:16:08.770 --> 00:16:12.280
Gianni Versace left his home to get a cup of coffee in the newest issues of new

289
00:16:12.281 --> 00:16:13.560
Yorker and Vogue magazine.

290
00:16:13.790 --> 00:16:17.440
Versace would never expect that he had a stalker who had been studying his every

291
00:16:17.441 --> 00:16:19.960
move. He was unlocking his front gate with his back,

292
00:16:20.240 --> 00:16:24.520
turned to the street when a serial killer named Andrew Connan shot him twice in

293
00:16:24.521 --> 00:16:26.680
the back of the head with a strange twist of fate.

294
00:16:26.780 --> 00:16:30.000
The bullet went through Versace's body and hit a nearby dove,

295
00:16:30.001 --> 00:16:32.280
which fell to the ground next to Versace's body.

296
00:16:32.550 --> 00:16:36.190
Antonio Damico was home waiting for his partner to return with his coffee and

297
00:16:36.350 --> 00:16:39.710
magazines. He said, I heard the shot. My heart just stopped.

298
00:16:39.810 --> 00:16:43.870
So I ran out and I saw Gianni lying on the stairs in blood.

299
00:16:44.390 --> 00:16:47.190
And GNI Versace was murdered in broad daylight. This morning,

300
00:16:47.300 --> 00:16:48.190
when the police arrived,

301
00:16:48.191 --> 00:16:50.630
they saw the dead bird lying on the ground next to Versace.

302
00:16:50.820 --> 00:16:54.260
They assumed the dove, maybe a symbol that hit by the Italian mob,

303
00:16:54.261 --> 00:16:57.900
but they eventually figured out that the culprit was Andrew Connan,

304
00:16:57.901 --> 00:17:01.700
who had already appeared on America's most wanted for killing four other men.

305
00:17:01.760 --> 00:17:02.860
During the press conference,

306
00:17:02.861 --> 00:17:05.900
it was announced to the press that Gianni Versace had no connection to Andrew

307
00:17:06.500 --> 00:17:07.333
Connan whatsoever.

308
00:17:07.560 --> 00:17:10.780
The FBI even had to investigate whether there was a connection between the two,

309
00:17:10.950 --> 00:17:13.340
eight days later, they finally caught up with a killer.

310
00:17:13.570 --> 00:17:14.730
He was surrounded by the police.

311
00:17:15.030 --> 00:17:18.050
He shot himself in the head before the FBI had a chance to question him.

312
00:17:18.070 --> 00:17:22.090
So no one knows his true motivation behind killing Versace.

313
00:17:22.390 --> 00:17:23.770
Before assassinating Versace,

314
00:17:23.771 --> 00:17:27.410
Andrew Conlan was an escort who catered to older wealthy men.

315
00:17:28.090 --> 00:17:30.610
Conan had a genius IQ and had a photographic memory.

316
00:17:30.790 --> 00:17:34.010
His parents had spoiled him rotten and given him absolutely everything he could

317
00:17:34.280 --> 00:17:37.680
could ask for Andrew was made to believe that he was better than everyone else.

318
00:17:37.980 --> 00:17:42.680
Anne's big surprise. He became a narcissist and a sociopath. Andrew Conan.

319
00:17:42.960 --> 00:17:44.760
He was the polar opposite of Giani Versace.

320
00:17:45.060 --> 00:17:49.240
He truly did feel that he was entitled to the finest things in life and he

321
00:17:49.241 --> 00:17:53.440
wouldn't have to work for it. Conan was incapable of empathy for other people.

322
00:17:53.780 --> 00:17:57.760
And he also became a compulsive liar telling everyone he met a different story

323
00:17:57.761 --> 00:18:00.760
about his name, his career, his parents, and much more.

324
00:18:00.950 --> 00:18:04.000
Some speculates that after learning that GI Versace was gay.

325
00:18:04.360 --> 00:18:08.320
Andrew con began stalking Versace and that he never approached him with the,

326
00:18:08.990 --> 00:18:12.630
of becoming his escort in the 2018 TV series, American crime story.

327
00:18:12.690 --> 00:18:14.310
The assassination of Gian Versace,

328
00:18:14.590 --> 00:18:17.430
a lot of speculation is made about the possibility that they could have met

329
00:18:17.431 --> 00:18:21.350
before the assassination. But if you watch it do so with a grain of salt,

330
00:18:21.351 --> 00:18:23.710
according to an interview with Antonio to Amico,

331
00:18:23.770 --> 00:18:26.350
he was insulted by what much of the show claims.

332
00:18:26.450 --> 00:18:30.420
And he believes that Versace never met can on him before after the autopsy,

333
00:18:30.520 --> 00:18:34.620
it was revealed that Gianni Versace had HIV because of this many speculates that

334
00:18:35.260 --> 00:18:37.820
Damco must have been unfaithful Lord, that they had an open relationship.

335
00:18:37.920 --> 00:18:42.420
But what we do know for certain is that Donna Versace did not like Antonio

336
00:18:43.220 --> 00:18:44.940
Damico at all in his world. Gian Versace,

337
00:18:44.970 --> 00:18:47.860
left Damco in allowance of $57,000 a month.

338
00:18:47.920 --> 00:18:49.770
And that he had the right to live in any of SAR,

339
00:18:49.771 --> 00:18:52.170
family mentions around the world, but Donna teller,

340
00:18:52.230 --> 00:18:55.850
she was in charge of the estate and she did not want amigo to have so much of

341
00:18:55.970 --> 00:18:58.770
her brother's money and his properties. So they went to court,

342
00:18:59.410 --> 00:19:02.250
amigo left with a lump sum for his inheritance and decided not to fight ever

343
00:19:02.310 --> 00:19:04.050
living in the mansion. After all,

344
00:19:04.051 --> 00:19:07.610
it was the place where he witnessed the love of his life shot and killed.

345
00:19:07.910 --> 00:19:10.440
It was the last place that it ever won. I live

346
00:19:16.650 --> 00:19:20.400
Donna ADE took go creative control of the company after Gian was killed.

347
00:19:20.500 --> 00:19:23.680
She and her older brother Sento agreed that they would keep the company private

348
00:19:24.060 --> 00:19:25.960
and family owns without her brother there.

349
00:19:25.961 --> 00:19:29.000
She was now the one and only designer to carry on the Versace legacy.

350
00:19:29.050 --> 00:19:29.700
Years later,

351
00:19:29.700 --> 00:19:33.190
she spoke at our Oxford university about how she managed to continue to grow the

352
00:19:33.191 --> 00:19:35.910
brand. Even after her brother's death. She said,

353
00:19:35.911 --> 00:19:38.870
fashion is a weapon that you can use when you need it.

354
00:19:39.050 --> 00:19:41.710
My own look makes people think I'm tough. It's like armor.

355
00:19:41.820 --> 00:19:44.710
That was useful to me. In the first years after Gianni's death,

356
00:19:44.770 --> 00:19:48.510
it was difficult to live that pain in public and to be compared to him when he

357
00:19:48.511 --> 00:19:51.940
was the genius. And I was only ever the accessory,

358
00:19:52.040 --> 00:19:54.860
it was hard to hear people constantly say, well, she make it,

359
00:19:55.120 --> 00:19:59.140
but she did sources Varys to how much the Versace brands was worth at the time

360
00:19:59.141 --> 00:20:01.780
of his death. Because the sales of his clothing truly did go down.

361
00:20:01.781 --> 00:20:02.820
After he came outta the closet,

362
00:20:03.420 --> 00:20:07.140
rods of its value vary between 400 and 700 million for next 11 years,

363
00:20:07.620 --> 00:20:09.820
Darella continued to grow the company. And in 2018,

364
00:20:09.821 --> 00:20:14.170
the Versace brands was purchased by the Michael cause for 2.1 billion,

365
00:20:14.990 --> 00:20:19.250
the Casa cast arena has been turned into a hotel and an event venue simply

366
00:20:19.251 --> 00:20:20.084
called the Villa.

367
00:20:20.210 --> 00:20:23.450
And it continues to be a popular Miami tourist attraction to this very day,

368
00:20:23.480 --> 00:20:24.730
even years after his death,

369
00:20:24.830 --> 00:20:29.530
the versa brand is still going strong and it will most likely be around for a

370
00:20:29.531 --> 00:20:33.680
very long time. So I really hope you found that video. Interesting. If you did,
