more on them in a bit.

4
00:00:13.470 --> 00:00:15.400
They say the greed is the downfall of man.

5
00:00:15.420 --> 00:00:18.280
It certainly was the downfall of one particular man,

6
00:00:18.310 --> 00:00:21.350
despite having all the power and of them on the, in the world,

7
00:00:21.910 --> 00:00:25.310
it was still not enough for Marcus Luin crashes.

8
00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:28.830
He could have spent the rest of his life as one of Rome's most influential

9
00:00:28.831 --> 00:00:33.470
citizens getting rich and fat off the countless properties and businesses that

10
00:00:33.471 --> 00:00:34.010
he owns.

11
00:00:34.010 --> 00:00:37.790
But instead he marched to his doom out of greed and hubris and caused not only

12
00:00:37.791 --> 00:00:38.610
his own demise,

13
00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:42.820
but embroiled Rome in conflict that would last over 250 years.

14
00:00:48.880 --> 00:00:53.420
Marcus CIN Craus was born CIR 115 BC into an old and

15
00:00:53.421 --> 00:00:55.500
respected Roman family named Luin.

16
00:00:55.680 --> 00:01:00.260
He was the second of three sons of Publius lass crisises, and VE Le.

17
00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:03.810
His father is successful, man. He served as a Senator then console,

18
00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:07.250
then cen then even had a Roman triumph that his honor,

19
00:01:07.300 --> 00:01:11.330
which was a public ceremony intended to celebrate a big military victory.

20
00:01:11.360 --> 00:01:13.850
Despite all of this, they lived modestly Pluto,

21
00:01:14.170 --> 00:01:16.570
dark who gives the most detailed account Ofra as his life.

22
00:01:16.810 --> 00:01:21.090
And the parallel lives said that the future general grew up in a small house and

23
00:01:21.250 --> 00:01:24.440
that both his brother got married while their parents were still alive.

24
00:01:24.500 --> 00:01:27.760
And they all lived under the same roof and ate at the same table.

25
00:01:27.940 --> 00:01:31.000
<v 1>One of CRA's brothers died in the early eighties,</v>

26
00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:35.920
BC and left behind a childless widow named Tatu. Although unusual for that time,

27
00:01:36.480 --> 00:01:38.960
crass decided to marry her and they had two boys together,

28
00:01:39.260 --> 00:01:43.150
Marcus and Publius his older brother also died for you years later,

29
00:01:43.151 --> 00:01:45.750
which means that he received the full inheritance from his parents,

30
00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:49.270
which was substantial despite their meager living conditions.

31
00:01:49.570 --> 00:01:51.350
<v 0>So just how substantial. Well,</v>

32
00:01:51.351 --> 00:01:54.470
of course it's hard to provide an accurate measurement of his wealth,

33
00:01:54.570 --> 00:01:59.150
but Pluto talk said that when KRA has started out, he had around 300 talents,

34
00:01:59.240 --> 00:02:02.870
which is great. I mean, but how much is their talent in today's?

35
00:02:02.990 --> 00:02:06.420
My that's actually surprisingly difficult to answer since the value of the

36
00:02:06.421 --> 00:02:10.580
talent was tied to the value of silver and has varied wildly over the course of

37
00:02:10.581 --> 00:02:12.820
the centuries that it was in use. Originally,

38
00:02:12.840 --> 00:02:17.100
the talent was simply a unit of weight first introduced in ancient Mesopotamia

39
00:02:17.300 --> 00:02:21.740
and used by everyone, the Acadians, the Sumerians IANS, the IANS, the Egyptians,

40
00:02:21.760 --> 00:02:22.940
the Hebrews, the talent,

41
00:02:23.220 --> 00:02:26.770
the Pluto art is referring to is the attic or Greek talent.

42
00:02:26.950 --> 00:02:30.130
It was still a unit of weight which measured around 26 kilograms,

43
00:02:30.131 --> 00:02:33.010
but it became far more commonly used as a unit of currency,

44
00:02:33.220 --> 00:02:36.810
which represented the weight of a talent in pure silver.

45
00:02:37.070 --> 00:02:40.330
So then how much was an at talent worth? Fortunately,

46
00:02:40.331 --> 00:02:41.850
others have already made some calculations.

47
00:02:41.910 --> 00:02:46.720
So we don't have to the English trends of Pluto book dated to 1916,

48
00:02:47.030 --> 00:02:51.960
estimated that one talent was worth around $1,200 or around $29,000

49
00:02:51.980 --> 00:02:52.761
in today's money.

50
00:02:52.761 --> 00:02:57.200
Another estimate was provided in 1885 by William Watson Goodwin who taught Greek

51
00:02:57.201 --> 00:03:01.280
studies that Harvard and recalculated that one talent was around a thousand

52
00:03:01.281 --> 00:03:04.360
dollars or $27,500 in modern currency.

53
00:03:04.580 --> 00:03:08.120
So both estimates were in the same ballpark. Now going back to Pluto, a,

54
00:03:08.300 --> 00:03:10.880
he said that CRAs has started out with 300 talents,

55
00:03:10.881 --> 00:03:13.360
which would be around $8.6 million today.

56
00:03:13.361 --> 00:03:16.080
And by the time he left for the path in expedition, where he died,

57
00:03:16.880 --> 00:03:21.550
crashes was worth around 7,100 talents, which would be over 200 million today.

58
00:03:21.690 --> 00:03:23.150
Of course, this is just a rough estimate.

59
00:03:23.310 --> 00:03:27.350
As some places is wealth in the billions and whether or not he truly was the

60
00:03:27.351 --> 00:03:29.070
richest man in Rome is again,

61
00:03:29.071 --> 00:03:32.190
something that is difficult for us to establish with any certainty

62
00:03:38.470 --> 00:03:40.060
Crisis is, is through the ranks of Rome,

63
00:03:40.061 --> 00:03:42.020
came during a time of Turmo for the Republic.

64
00:03:42.160 --> 00:03:45.980
One that perhaps foreshadowed its eventual collapse just a few decades later.

65
00:03:46.120 --> 00:03:49.100
The main cause for this turmoil was a rivalry between two men,

66
00:03:49.500 --> 00:03:54.020
solar and GAAS Mars who were both highly decorated military commanders,

67
00:03:54.160 --> 00:03:56.820
but fierce opponents in 88, BC solar,

68
00:03:56.880 --> 00:04:00.810
who was a cons at the time was getting ready to take his me in March Easter to

69
00:04:00.811 --> 00:04:05.210
fight the kingdom of Ponti in modern day, Turkey led by king myth Rodda the six,

70
00:04:05.211 --> 00:04:06.044
however,

71
00:04:06.170 --> 00:04:10.330
GU Marus also wanted that position and to use his influence and intrigues to

72
00:04:10.480 --> 00:04:14.810
relieve solar of his duty, but he did not anticipate his opponents next move.

73
00:04:14.811 --> 00:04:18.170
Instead of relinquishing commands, solar took his troops and marched on Rome.

74
00:04:18.310 --> 00:04:21.360
The same as Julius Caesar would do. 40 years later,

75
00:04:21.510 --> 00:04:25.280
this became known as so's first civil war and the general garner the distinction

76
00:04:25.281 --> 00:04:29.080
of being the first man to seize power of the Roman Republic through forced gas,

77
00:04:29.600 --> 00:04:32.480
Mars, and his cohorts. However, managed to flee the city and retreat to Africa,

78
00:04:32.530 --> 00:04:34.400
where they regrouped back in Rome,

79
00:04:34.720 --> 00:04:36.880
solar consolidated his power enacted new policies,

80
00:04:36.940 --> 00:04:40.790
placed to supporters in high ranking officer then traveled to pons to find king

81
00:04:41.030 --> 00:04:43.190
with dart as originally intended.

82
00:04:43.300 --> 00:04:46.430
This provided GAAS Marus with the time he needed to raise an army.

83
00:04:46.610 --> 00:04:50.470
So the following year he entered Roman successfully ousted solar supporters,

84
00:04:50.471 --> 00:04:52.470
raising all the changes enacted by his enemy.

85
00:04:52.610 --> 00:04:57.510
The con was a lot bloodier as it was followed by the Mar and purges

86
00:04:57.511 --> 00:05:00.990
where Marus and his allies are assassinated. A lot of. So supporters,

87
00:05:01.060 --> 00:05:05.340
this included Luci Luin CRAs older brother of Marcus CRAs,

88
00:05:05.341 --> 00:05:08.220
and presumably also his father who died around the same time.

89
00:05:08.660 --> 00:05:10.900
Although weren't unsure of the exact circumstances,

90
00:05:11.050 --> 00:05:14.260
it's possible that publi lyin CRA has committed suicide.

91
00:05:14.261 --> 00:05:17.820
Knowing that a far worse fate was awaiting him with the Senator,

92
00:05:18.180 --> 00:05:20.820
his mercy marrys organized elections for consuls,

93
00:05:20.821 --> 00:05:23.490
but only two people were allowed to take part himself.

94
00:05:23.510 --> 00:05:27.450
And his second in commands, Lucius Cornelius, sinner, unsurprisingly,

95
00:05:27.451 --> 00:05:30.170
they became the new consoles. Once he fulfilled all of his goals,

96
00:05:30.650 --> 00:05:34.810
Gais Marus died just a few days later and sinner took over eager to avoid the

97
00:05:34.811 --> 00:05:35.371
same pages.

98
00:05:35.371 --> 00:05:39.810
His father and brother crass fled Roman traveled to his Spania to meet some of

99
00:05:39.811 --> 00:05:40.630
his father's friends.

100
00:05:40.630 --> 00:05:43.640
He spent the next few years there living in a cave near the sea making

101
00:05:43.641 --> 00:05:45.040
arrangements, building an army,

102
00:05:45.310 --> 00:05:48.760
knowing that another battle between the two sides was inevitable. However,

103
00:05:49.240 --> 00:05:51.360
Senator would not take part in 84 BC.

104
00:05:51.380 --> 00:05:55.080
He thought he would launch a surprise attack on his enemies by crossing the AIC

105
00:05:55.220 --> 00:05:56.240
sea into D Maia.

106
00:05:56.480 --> 00:06:00.120
Although the circumstances are a bit murky sinner angered his own soldier

107
00:06:00.190 --> 00:06:02.000
somehow, and he was killed in IM mutiny.

108
00:06:02.020 --> 00:06:04.280
The leadership of his faction was passed on others,

109
00:06:04.310 --> 00:06:08.040
such as GAAS Marus the younger and a cons named carbo.

110
00:06:08.060 --> 00:06:12.000
It was an 83 BC that solar launched his second defensive on Rome predictably

111
00:06:12.050 --> 00:06:15.200
named solar's second civil war. He was joined by crass,

112
00:06:15.220 --> 00:06:18.830
but also by PO pay who was up and coming general at the time,

113
00:06:18.970 --> 00:06:22.790
the decisive moments in the war came at the battle of Colleen gates in November

114
00:06:22.810 --> 00:06:26.230
of 82 BC, where Marcus crass played a pivotal role.

115
00:06:26.250 --> 00:06:27.910
He was in charge of the right wing.

116
00:06:27.911 --> 00:06:30.630
And while solar's troops were getting pushed back into the center,

117
00:06:31.350 --> 00:06:34.790
crass was victorious on his side and completely routed their enemies once.

118
00:06:35.030 --> 00:06:36.310
So was in charge of Rome. Again,

119
00:06:36.311 --> 00:06:39.420
he declared him so of dictator and spent the next couple of years hunting down

120
00:06:39.440 --> 00:06:42.580
the remaining members of the Marion faction. At the same time,

121
00:06:42.600 --> 00:06:44.780
he was also very generous when it came to rewarding,

122
00:06:44.781 --> 00:06:48.060
his supporters and Marcus crass was at the top of the list.

123
00:06:54.170 --> 00:06:58.290
This was the beginning of CRA's path to Exor Orent wealth.

124
00:06:58.510 --> 00:07:02.490
He lost everything when he fled Rome because his enemies enacted prescriptions

125
00:07:02.491 --> 00:07:04.370
and confiscated all of his families property.

126
00:07:04.670 --> 00:07:08.130
But now the same thing was happening to the Marion supporters.

127
00:07:08.490 --> 00:07:11.770
Solar took everything they owned, which was now being sold off for peanuts.

128
00:07:12.110 --> 00:07:16.090
Andras was the main buyer letting his greed completely take over or his Pluto

129
00:07:16.330 --> 00:07:16.710
tar put it.

130
00:07:16.710 --> 00:07:21.480
<v 1>The many virtues of CRA were obscured by his so vice of AEST and it is likely</v>

131
00:07:21.760 --> 00:07:25.840
sort of the one vice which became stronger than all the others in him weakens

132
00:07:25.860 --> 00:07:26.500
the rest.

133
00:07:26.500 --> 00:07:30.880
The historian makes mention of one case in Bri where CRAs has prescribed a

134
00:07:30.950 --> 00:07:32.720
wealthy man without solar's permission,

135
00:07:32.750 --> 00:07:34.720
just so that he could buy his estate at auction.

136
00:07:34.830 --> 00:07:38.910
Another even more scandalous episode occurred when crass was accused of erupting

137
00:07:38.911 --> 00:07:39.191
a vest,

138
00:07:39.191 --> 00:07:43.590
Virgin names like Sinnia when in fact he kept visiting her because he wanted to

139
00:07:43.591 --> 00:07:46.190
buy her Villa, but this was not enough for crisis.

140
00:07:46.460 --> 00:07:48.830
<v 0>Once there was no more confiscated property to purchase.</v>

141
00:07:48.850 --> 00:07:52.630
He moved on delict and destroyed buildings that had been damaged after years of

142
00:07:52.790 --> 00:07:55.590
fighting. He also bought hundreds of slaves who were skilled laborers,

143
00:07:55.591 --> 00:07:58.910
particularly builders and architects. So he purchased Ru buildings for,

144
00:07:59.080 --> 00:08:02.620
to nothing repaired or rebuilt them using slave labor and then sold them off for

145
00:08:02.621 --> 00:08:03.410
a large profit.

146
00:08:03.410 --> 00:08:07.460
Next up crisises realized that many houses were damaged by fires in Rome almost

147
00:08:07.461 --> 00:08:10.340
every day. So he established his own private fire department.

148
00:08:10.640 --> 00:08:13.900
Of course they did not perform this service outta the goodness of their hearts.

149
00:08:13.960 --> 00:08:17.100
No, if a person's house caught on fire brigade would rush over there,

150
00:08:17.280 --> 00:08:20.770
but then they would just sit back and relax you to watch the fire burn.

151
00:08:20.790 --> 00:08:23.570
The whole thing down that was when crashes showed up,

152
00:08:23.580 --> 00:08:27.530
ready to make an offer to buy the property while it still had some little value.

153
00:08:27.670 --> 00:08:30.890
If the person accepted, then the brigade put out the fire. If they didn't,

154
00:08:30.891 --> 00:08:33.370
then the house burned down to ashes and crashes made a new offer.

155
00:08:33.440 --> 00:08:37.770
This time much lower than the previous one, one way or another. You know,

156
00:08:37.771 --> 00:08:42.000
my stories came out on top in addition to is ever growing real estate empire CRA

157
00:08:42.240 --> 00:08:45.880
has also derived his massive wealth from other sources, such as slaves,

158
00:08:45.881 --> 00:08:49.840
silver mines, and the lambs used for agriculture, despite all his actions,

159
00:08:49.841 --> 00:08:53.040
Pluto, tar did not consider CRAs as an unpleasant man. Quite the contrary.

160
00:08:53.041 --> 00:08:53.580
In fact,

161
00:08:53.580 --> 00:08:57.840
the historians said the wealthy Roman won everyone over with universal kindness,

162
00:08:57.841 --> 00:09:01.800
dignity of person, persuasiveness of speech and winning grace of feature.

163
00:09:02.030 --> 00:09:05.840
Despite his obsession with making money, crass was never loathed to spend it.

164
00:09:05.841 --> 00:09:08.640
And he was generous with strangers and kept his house open to all.

165
00:09:08.700 --> 00:09:12.680
He was an esteemed and careful man and one who was ready with his help.

166
00:09:12.820 --> 00:09:17.470
He pleased people also by the kindly and unaffected manner with which

167
00:09:17.610 --> 00:09:19.950
he classed their hands and dressed them free,

168
00:09:19.951 --> 00:09:23.790
never met a Roman so obscure and so lowly that he did not return his greeting

169
00:09:24.130 --> 00:09:28.110
and call him by name. But wealth alone was not enough for a Roman of note.

170
00:09:28.111 --> 00:09:32.950
He also needed status and influence. So to gain these crashes had two choices,

171
00:09:33.270 --> 00:09:34.870
politics, or the military.

172
00:09:35.080 --> 00:09:37.580
He chose the former because he was better suited for it.

173
00:09:37.581 --> 00:09:42.100
And it would've been undoubtedly aided by his wealth and his lineage. Meanwhile,

174
00:09:42.101 --> 00:09:43.700
being a successful military commander,

175
00:09:43.701 --> 00:09:46.220
would've meant being away from Rome for long periods of time,

176
00:09:46.221 --> 00:09:48.220
which would've adversely affected his businesses.

177
00:09:48.400 --> 00:09:52.740
Unsurprisingly crashes turned out to be enable politician and skilled a terror.

178
00:09:53.020 --> 00:09:54.380
He pursued the curses.

179
00:09:54.410 --> 00:09:59.050
Honorum AKA a tradition of sequence of public officers held by senators as they

180
00:09:59.210 --> 00:10:00.570
steadily climbed the political ladder.

181
00:10:00.710 --> 00:10:04.450
He was described as making very many changes in his political views and was

182
00:10:04.451 --> 00:10:07.450
neither a steadfast friends nor an implacable enemy,

183
00:10:07.870 --> 00:10:12.330
but readily abandoned both his favors and his resentments that the dictates of

184
00:10:12.331 --> 00:10:15.930
his interests. So that frequently within a short space of time,

185
00:10:16.100 --> 00:10:18.440
the same men and the same measures found in him,

186
00:10:18.720 --> 00:10:21.680
both an advocate and an opponent throughout his life.

187
00:10:21.681 --> 00:10:25.080
It did seem to bother crass that he never achieved the same kind of military

188
00:10:25.440 --> 00:10:26.440
glory. Some of his colleagues,

189
00:10:26.660 --> 00:10:31.000
he had a particular chip on his shoulder about Pompe who went away to fight into

190
00:10:31.280 --> 00:10:33.880
mass Victor victories while crass was building his real estate, em empire,

191
00:10:33.950 --> 00:10:38.030
despite his young age, he was already being Pompe. The great and Pluto,

192
00:10:38.150 --> 00:10:41.950
a related one incident. When somebody announced the arrival of Pompe,

193
00:10:41.970 --> 00:10:46.750
the great and crass fell to the floor, laughing asking how great is he?

194
00:10:46.850 --> 00:10:47.710
But in 73,

195
00:10:48.010 --> 00:10:51.830
BC Marcus crass was granted the opportunity to gain some prestige for himself as

196
00:10:51.970 --> 00:10:55.550
he was tasked with putting down a rebellion started by an escaped slave named

197
00:10:55.870 --> 00:10:59.060
spar. And just before we could continue with the rest of this video,

225
00:12:25.670 --> 00:12:29.150
A lot of you are probably already familiar with sparas if you are not.

226
00:12:29.370 --> 00:12:31.990
Or if you simply want to learn about his rebellion in more detail,

227
00:12:31.991 --> 00:12:35.380
we actually already did a biographics video all about sparas,

228
00:12:35.381 --> 00:12:37.700
which you should check out after you watch this video.

229
00:12:38.200 --> 00:12:40.620
If you haven't seen it already. Here is the cliff notes version though.

230
00:12:40.720 --> 00:12:44.260
Sparas and a bunch of other slaves escaped from a gladiator school and Kaur in

231
00:12:44.261 --> 00:12:47.300
73 BC and started raid the Italian countryside.

232
00:12:47.370 --> 00:12:50.020
Such revolts were not unheard of. In fact,

233
00:12:50.080 --> 00:12:53.460
the war of sparas is also known as the third war.

234
00:12:53.530 --> 00:12:56.410
Part of a series of conflicts caused by slave uprisings.

235
00:12:56.411 --> 00:13:00.770
That is why the Roman Senate did not really show much concern at first only

236
00:13:00.771 --> 00:13:03.650
sending militia and local patrols after sparas.

237
00:13:03.670 --> 00:13:06.730
And assuming that they would be enough to put down the rebellion,

238
00:13:06.731 --> 00:13:08.330
none of them could get the job done. However,

239
00:13:08.440 --> 00:13:12.450
they were defeated by the slaves whose numbers kept growing as more and more

240
00:13:12.451 --> 00:13:15.280
people joined their cause even properly trained.

241
00:13:15.281 --> 00:13:19.640
Roman legions led by consoles were bested by the rebels. And well,

242
00:13:19.641 --> 00:13:20.680
the Senate started to panic.

243
00:13:21.030 --> 00:13:24.840
That is when they gave the task of defeating sparas to Marcus crass.

244
00:13:24.841 --> 00:13:28.960
Also making him a prey to and giving him commands of eight legions.

245
00:13:29.030 --> 00:13:32.960
This was something that crass needed in order to advance his career and to

246
00:13:32.961 --> 00:13:35.350
achieve it. He showed a degree of ruthlessness.

247
00:13:35.351 --> 00:13:36.750
He never really displayed before.

248
00:13:36.751 --> 00:13:40.150
This was exemplified after an incident with his legate Maus,

249
00:13:40.210 --> 00:13:44.350
who was given commands of two legions and told to follow sparas and Hisar

250
00:13:44.351 --> 00:13:46.550
without engaging them in combat mumus.

251
00:13:46.551 --> 00:13:48.630
However thought that he had the upper hands.

252
00:13:48.830 --> 00:13:51.310
So he attacked the rebels and lost to punish him.

253
00:13:51.910 --> 00:13:54.190
Crass revived the practice of decimation.

254
00:13:54.290 --> 00:13:56.740
He took the 500 soldiers who were the first to retreat,

255
00:13:56.930 --> 00:14:00.900
divided them into groups of 10 and made them draw lots with one man being

256
00:14:01.060 --> 00:14:03.980
executed from each group, despite the Rocky star crash,

257
00:14:04.220 --> 00:14:08.740
as soon had the advantage he had trapped sparas and his army and brought him and

258
00:14:09.140 --> 00:14:11.820
had ditches and walls erected to prevent the enemy from running away.

259
00:14:11.920 --> 00:14:12.860
His plan was to,

260
00:14:12.980 --> 00:14:16.490
with his opponents down through attrition and leave them vomit for one final

261
00:14:16.510 --> 00:14:18.730
attack. However, he soon received terrible news.

262
00:14:18.830 --> 00:14:22.330
The Senate was sending him reinforcement. Now this might sound like good news,

263
00:14:22.670 --> 00:14:26.530
but it wasn't because POM bay was the one leading those reinforcements crass

264
00:14:26.531 --> 00:14:29.850
knew that the only reason they chose him in the first place was because Pompe

265
00:14:29.851 --> 00:14:33.090
was busy putting down a revolt in a Spania, but he had been successful.

266
00:14:33.230 --> 00:14:34.570
And now he was heading this way.

267
00:14:34.830 --> 00:14:38.400
Andras realized that if the gladiator rebellion ended, when Pompe arrived,

268
00:14:38.780 --> 00:14:41.880
he would be the one receiving all the glory. Unfortunately, for crashes.

269
00:14:41.910 --> 00:14:45.760
That is exactly what happened. He met sparas in one decisive action,

270
00:14:45.810 --> 00:14:49.560
known as the battle of so Laris river, despite sustaining significant losses,

271
00:14:49.561 --> 00:14:53.440
the Roman was triumphant sparas was killed in the battle as were tens of

272
00:14:53.560 --> 00:14:54.440
thousands of his soldiers.

273
00:14:54.680 --> 00:14:58.800
Thousands more were taken prisoner and later crucified along the Appian way on

274
00:14:59.480 --> 00:15:02.160
crass orders, but around 5,000 or store managed to plea the battle,

275
00:15:02.350 --> 00:15:05.440
they ran into Pompe army and were cut down without hesitation.

276
00:15:05.720 --> 00:15:09.560
But this allowed Pompe to write to the Senate saying that crass had conquered

277
00:15:09.561 --> 00:15:12.990
the slaves, but he himself had extubated the war for his efforts,

278
00:15:12.991 --> 00:15:14.190
not just against sparas,

279
00:15:14.210 --> 00:15:18.310
but also in Hispania Pompe was awarded a major triumph upon his return to Rome,

280
00:15:18.440 --> 00:15:21.790
grass, as meanwhile did not object, as he knew, it'd make him seem petty.

281
00:15:21.850 --> 00:15:26.190
And I ignorable instead what he did was ask Pompe for help despite his young age

282
00:15:26.390 --> 00:15:28.070
and an experience when it came to public office,

283
00:15:28.360 --> 00:15:33.020
Pompe had been asked to stand for consul ship was the highest position of the

284
00:15:33.380 --> 00:15:36.740
curus. Honorum typically two consoles were elected to serve a one year term.

285
00:15:36.760 --> 00:15:39.980
So crass asked Pompe to endorse him as the other candidates,

286
00:15:39.981 --> 00:15:44.180
which Pompe did because he thought it would be useful to have crasser a favor.

287
00:15:44.360 --> 00:15:46.940
So the two became consoles together in 70 BBC.

288
00:15:47.100 --> 00:15:50.460
Although Pluto are specified that their terms ended without anything of

289
00:15:50.700 --> 00:15:53.690
significance happening because each one tried to undo the measures of the other.

290
00:16:00.170 --> 00:16:03.810
Although the relationship between crass and Pompe was never openly hostile off,

291
00:16:03.830 --> 00:16:07.090
it was contentious since the two of them usually had the same ambitions,

292
00:16:07.310 --> 00:16:11.050
but a third element was introduced into the equation, which changed the dynamic.

293
00:16:11.270 --> 00:16:13.320
And that hell was Julia Caesar.

294
00:16:13.880 --> 00:16:17.200
Caesar was another prominent citizen of Rome who was climbing the ranks and saw

295
00:16:17.201 --> 00:16:18.880
the potential for a powerful Alliance.

296
00:16:19.070 --> 00:16:22.440
IFRA and Pompe were able to put aside their differences. At first,

297
00:16:22.920 --> 00:16:25.000
CES was actually the junior in the partnership.

298
00:16:25.210 --> 00:16:26.840
Pompe was Rome's most celebrated.

299
00:16:27.120 --> 00:16:30.240
Military commander while KRAS was the city's most influential land owner.

300
00:16:30.380 --> 00:16:33.710
And both were more powerful than him Caesar that didn't not want a risk making

301
00:16:33.730 --> 00:16:36.350
an enemy out of one of them by fully supporting the other.

302
00:16:36.410 --> 00:16:39.990
So instead he persuaded them that it would be in all their best interests if

303
00:16:39.991 --> 00:16:44.710
they worked together against other prominent statesmen, such as Carto and Ciro,

304
00:16:44.810 --> 00:16:49.470
who opposed them all, that is how the first Traver was born around 60 BC.

305
00:16:49.570 --> 00:16:50.430
In the words of Livy,

306
00:16:50.490 --> 00:16:54.660
it was a conspiracy against the state by three leading citizens.

307
00:16:54.730 --> 00:16:56.140
They did not share an agenda,

308
00:16:56.360 --> 00:16:59.780
but they sought to help each other out so that they could bypass the Senate in

309
00:16:59.781 --> 00:17:01.060
order to accomplish their goals.

310
00:17:01.580 --> 00:17:05.620
Pluto a said that Rome was divided into three powerful parties that have Pompe

311
00:17:05.621 --> 00:17:07.780
that have Caesar and that have CRAs.

312
00:17:07.960 --> 00:17:10.700
It was the thoughtful and conservative part of the city,

313
00:17:10.701 --> 00:17:13.930
which attached itself to Pompe the violence and volatile apart,

314
00:17:13.931 --> 00:17:17.970
which supported the hopes of Caesar while crass took a middle ground and drew

315
00:17:17.971 --> 00:17:21.690
from both Caesar was the one who most benefited from this traverse with the

316
00:17:21.691 --> 00:17:22.491
support of his allies.

317
00:17:22.491 --> 00:17:25.890
He was elected console and was granted in army and then went off to fight the

318
00:17:26.050 --> 00:17:27.010
go. After a few years,

319
00:17:27.210 --> 00:17:29.970
his military success made Caesar very popular and influential.

320
00:17:29.990 --> 00:17:33.930
And his two co-conspirators started feeling like they were getting the short end

321
00:17:33.931 --> 00:17:34.764
of the stick.

322
00:17:34.960 --> 00:17:38.520
Although they faced heavy resistance from their enemies in the Senate in 56,

323
00:17:38.780 --> 00:17:42.120
BC Pompe and Marcus crash has secured another cons ship for themselves.

324
00:17:42.500 --> 00:17:46.760
And afterwards were assigned governorships of Roman provinces Pompe received two

325
00:17:46.960 --> 00:17:49.440
provinces inania while CRAs received Syria.

326
00:17:49.660 --> 00:17:52.720
The exact circumstances behind this political move are uncertain.

327
00:17:52.790 --> 00:17:56.840
Some historians claimed that Caesar helps them become consoles again in attempt

328
00:17:56.841 --> 00:17:58.800
to preserve their waning Alliance.

329
00:17:58.810 --> 00:18:02.680
While others said that crass and Pompe did this without Caesar's approval

330
00:18:02.681 --> 00:18:04.840
specifically to counter his growing influence

331
00:18:11.300 --> 00:18:15.150
Back then being made a governor of a province meant that you had car Blan to do

332
00:18:15.350 --> 00:18:18.630
whatever you wanted. More or less, that was receive bribe, take loans,

333
00:18:18.631 --> 00:18:20.150
start new businesses, et cetera.

334
00:18:20.250 --> 00:18:23.630
It was usually regarded as a reward from the Senate to make yourself as rich as

335
00:18:23.750 --> 00:18:24.990
possible while you served as governor.

336
00:18:25.100 --> 00:18:29.380
This should have been an ideal position for crashes, but he wanted more,

337
00:18:29.520 --> 00:18:31.540
not satisfied with the richest found in Syria.

338
00:18:31.720 --> 00:18:34.620
He thought about expanding to the east into the Perian empire.

339
00:18:34.720 --> 00:18:38.900
The two nations had a complicated and violent relationship for most of the 500

340
00:18:39.180 --> 00:18:41.820
year existence of the Perian M empire founded in the mid third century.

341
00:18:42.180 --> 00:18:44.260
BC pario was an Iranian civilization,

342
00:18:44.460 --> 00:18:47.660
but became a powerhouse in the middle east when it defeated the saluted em

343
00:18:47.661 --> 00:18:51.050
empire, it took over all of their T and just kept expanding.

344
00:18:51.190 --> 00:18:54.890
The problem with expansion is that eventually you run into other people who

345
00:18:54.891 --> 00:18:58.370
would prefer to stop your expansion. That's what happens to Paia.

346
00:18:58.610 --> 00:19:01.610
It expanded Westwood until it reached Roman territory, even.

347
00:19:01.630 --> 00:19:03.050
So for about 200 years,

348
00:19:03.051 --> 00:19:07.210
the two sides coexisted using the kingdom of Armenia as a useful buffer between

349
00:19:07.211 --> 00:19:09.490
their lands. This changed in 54 BBC. However,

350
00:19:09.560 --> 00:19:13.440
when the first of a series of conflicts known as the Roman Pathan wars began

351
00:19:13.441 --> 00:19:16.120
after Crassus decided to Rick his military career,

352
00:19:16.140 --> 00:19:20.680
nobody knows what brought this on crass was over 60 years old and he had not

353
00:19:20.681 --> 00:19:24.480
taken part in a military campaign for almost 20 years since he fought sparas.

354
00:19:24.540 --> 00:19:27.000
Was it Mely his greed that spurred him on?

355
00:19:27.001 --> 00:19:30.870
Or was it also his design not to be out shines by Pompe Caesar?

356
00:19:30.871 --> 00:19:34.590
According to Pluto, a in private CRAs has made youthful boasts,

357
00:19:34.591 --> 00:19:39.310
which ill become his years saying that he will go beyond Patha into India

358
00:19:39.490 --> 00:19:42.190
and bacteria and make Pompeo's campaigns against Mr.

359
00:19:42.830 --> 00:19:44.350
Roddas look like child's played.

360
00:19:44.351 --> 00:19:47.870
So it definitely seems like he was motivated by more than just money as a

361
00:19:47.910 --> 00:19:51.620
governor crass had the power to levion army. So in 53 BC,

362
00:19:51.621 --> 00:19:54.540
even without senates approval, he invaded Mesopotamia.

363
00:19:54.600 --> 00:19:56.740
At first things went quite well for the Roman commander.

364
00:19:56.741 --> 00:20:00.060
Most cities offer a tribute Andi themselves with the Romans willingly,

365
00:20:00.061 --> 00:20:03.380
particularly the Greek cities that had been founded by the Macedonians during

366
00:20:03.381 --> 00:20:07.140
the time of Alexander. One exception was a city called Zen doin,

367
00:20:07.150 --> 00:20:10.020
which arrested and killed some of crashes as soldiers.

368
00:20:10.021 --> 00:20:13.650
So I wouldn't return crash as PL it and enslaved all of its citizens.

369
00:20:13.790 --> 00:20:16.530
The Roman general made his first mistake when winter came,

370
00:20:16.531 --> 00:20:18.290
because instead of pressing the attack,

371
00:20:18.291 --> 00:20:22.770
he retreated to Syria until spring waiting for his son Publius to arrive with

372
00:20:22.970 --> 00:20:24.450
reinforcement. By this point, of course,

373
00:20:24.451 --> 00:20:26.530
the IANS received word of his incursions,

374
00:20:26.590 --> 00:20:30.890
and this gave them time to prepare even sent an NVO Toras this from king or OES,

375
00:20:30.891 --> 00:20:34.800
the seconds of par giving him one last chance to stop his invasion.

376
00:20:34.970 --> 00:20:38.880
Boastfully Crassus reply that he would give the king his response in Salus,

377
00:20:39.070 --> 00:20:42.360
meaning that he planned to take the path, the end capital to this.

378
00:20:42.361 --> 00:20:45.680
The ENVO burst out in laughter and pointing at his Palm said, oh,

379
00:20:46.240 --> 00:20:49.520
crasus hair will grow there before thou shall see sous.

380
00:20:49.960 --> 00:20:51.760
The second mistake came when he refused the aid of king.

381
00:20:52.360 --> 00:20:56.360
Arva the second of Armenia who offered CRA a safe passage and reinforcement.

382
00:20:56.361 --> 00:20:58.280
If he invaded Paia through his land,

383
00:20:58.430 --> 00:21:02.640
instead crass that accepted the help of AAM knee leader of the kingdom of oone

384
00:21:02.920 --> 00:21:07.830
and crossed the Aras into Mepo AAM knee had served inpe the past and proved

385
00:21:07.831 --> 00:21:10.430
himself a friend of Rome. But on this occasion,

386
00:21:10.770 --> 00:21:14.750
he was working with the Parsons and led crashes and troops into the open desert,

387
00:21:14.760 --> 00:21:16.990
completely weakened, tired, and demoralized.

388
00:21:16.991 --> 00:21:21.270
The Roman troops port the Parsons at the battle of Kaha in 53 BC located in

389
00:21:21.271 --> 00:21:22.350
modern day Harran Turkey.

390
00:21:22.650 --> 00:21:25.910
The Persians led by a general named Serena slaughtered.

391
00:21:25.911 --> 00:21:28.140
The Romans even they were severely outnumbered.

392
00:21:28.660 --> 00:21:31.500
Crass had clearly lost the battle. His son Publius had been killed,

393
00:21:31.501 --> 00:21:34.500
and most of his remaining men were getting ready to mu him.

394
00:21:34.520 --> 00:21:35.660
He tried making a truce,

395
00:21:35.661 --> 00:21:39.460
but this was a trap and Marcus crashes and his entire revenue were killed when

396
00:21:39.461 --> 00:21:41.020
they met the Patian. According to Pluto,

397
00:21:41.220 --> 00:21:43.660
art crashes as killer was a man named PO max threes.

398
00:21:43.780 --> 00:21:47.420
He then cut off his heads and one hand and sent them to the Pathan king,

399
00:21:47.760 --> 00:21:50.490
much more notorious death was told by Cassius Dio,

400
00:21:50.491 --> 00:21:54.730
who said that crass had Moten gold pulled down his throat to punish him prison.

401
00:21:55.050 --> 00:21:58.650
And in greed, although he didn't specify if the Roman general was alive or dead,

402
00:21:58.651 --> 00:22:01.330
when this happened back home, his death, that important in consequences,

403
00:22:01.850 --> 00:22:03.890
the starters, it was a humiliating defeat for Rome.

404
00:22:03.990 --> 00:22:05.490
One that had to be answered for.

405
00:22:05.590 --> 00:22:09.400
So Patha became one of its fierce enemies for the next 250 years,

406
00:22:09.840 --> 00:22:13.520
but crass as demise also meant the end of the first Tru its Pompe and Caesar

407
00:22:13.550 --> 00:22:16.960
were already on hostile terms by this point. And with crass has gone,

408
00:22:16.961 --> 00:22:19.440
the two of them were firmly placed on a collision course,

409
00:22:19.530 --> 00:22:24.480
which prompted the fall of the Republic and gave rise to the Roman empire.

410
00:22:26.580 --> 00:22:28.910
