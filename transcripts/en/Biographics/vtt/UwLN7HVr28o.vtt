00:00:00.070 --> 00:00:01.560
<v 0>Some of, you might have heard this before,</v>

2
00:00:01.561 --> 00:00:03.200
but I have another channel called business bla.

3
00:00:03.260 --> 00:00:07.000
And that actually led to the development of this very product. Long story short,

4
00:00:07.080 --> 00:00:10.040
I made a joke about how YouTubers all have these beauty lines.

5
00:00:10.580 --> 00:00:13.320
And I found that channel, email me saying, Simon, you should make a beauty line,

6
00:00:13.321 --> 00:00:16.840
but you should make some beard oil because you have a magnificent beard.

7
00:00:16.860 --> 00:00:20.990
And I was like, I agree. And so we made beard, bla beard blaze makes a, a full,

8
00:00:21.030 --> 00:00:24.990
luscious beard reality solving all of life's problems with fine facial hair.

9
00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:26.243
Not a guarantee.

10
00:00:26.300 --> 00:00:28.870
What happened is I teamed up with a fan of that channel called will.

11
00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:32.430
He sent me a bunch of samples of beard oil. I tried them all in my beard.

12
00:00:32.590 --> 00:00:34.030
I found the ones that worked best for me.

13
00:00:34.250 --> 00:00:35.590
And then we made a whole range of them.

14
00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:38.150
I've used a lot of beards over the last few years,

15
00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:40.390
and basically I'm a bit biased,

16
00:00:40.391 --> 00:00:42.580
but I think this the best one that I've ever tried also,

17
00:00:43.380 --> 00:00:46.460
I always noticed that beard alls tend to come in tiny little bottles and be

18
00:00:46.461 --> 00:00:47.280
super expensive.

19
00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:49.700
So we made a proper size bottle and we made it at a proper price.

20
00:00:49.720 --> 00:00:53.700
You can go to beard, blaze.com to find out more about that.

21
00:00:54.160 --> 00:00:57.580
No discount codes, nothing special like that, because this is from me.

22
00:00:57.581 --> 00:01:00.500
You could just go to the website and try it out. Then let's get into the video.

23
00:01:07.090 --> 00:01:10.730
I'm ALA a cheat, a Charan, but at least I know it.

24
00:01:10.820 --> 00:01:13.730
Those are the words of James Randy illustrating his unique,

25
00:01:13.870 --> 00:01:15.610
direct and honest outlook on life.

26
00:01:15.611 --> 00:01:19.090
Randy trained and worked as a magician for most of his life and a pretty

27
00:01:19.091 --> 00:01:20.210
successful one too,

28
00:01:20.270 --> 00:01:24.680
but then decided to retire from magic and become a professional debunk.

29
00:01:24.940 --> 00:01:26.240
So what's he debunk well,

30
00:01:26.241 --> 00:01:29.960
pretty much everything that had to do with the paranormal psychics, mediums,

31
00:01:29.961 --> 00:01:32.360
faith healers, fortune tellers, spoon, benders,

32
00:01:32.361 --> 00:01:35.000
they all practiced what Randy called. Woo woo.

33
00:01:35.001 --> 00:01:37.160
Having spent most of his life in the world of magic.

34
00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:41.120
Randy knew all of their secrets and how to use them against the people claiming

35
00:01:41.300 --> 00:01:42.360
to have supernatural power.

36
00:01:43.030 --> 00:01:46.310
Randy himself preferred to be called an investigator rather than a debunker,

37
00:01:46.311 --> 00:01:50.870
arguing that the latter already proclaimed to know something was false and set

38
00:01:50.871 --> 00:01:52.030
out to show everyone else.

39
00:01:52.040 --> 00:01:56.190
While the former merely investigated specific claims from an objective starting

40
00:01:56.191 --> 00:01:57.024
point. In other words,

41
00:01:57.150 --> 00:02:00.750
Randy did not deal in absolute and did not outright dismiss entire concepts like

42
00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:02.350
magic or faith healing.

43
00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:06.940
The people who claimed to be doing them in this regard most famous of all was

44
00:02:07.140 --> 00:02:11.060
his $1 million paranormal charge. The premise was simple. Come to his Institute,

45
00:02:11.150 --> 00:02:15.100
prove any kind of supernatural ability under supervised laboratory controlled

46
00:02:15.101 --> 00:02:17.260
conditions and win a million bucks.

47
00:02:17.480 --> 00:02:20.820
The prize ended in 2015 unclaimed

48
00:02:27.020 --> 00:02:30.610
James Randy was born Randall James Hamilton's w on August the seventh,

49
00:02:30.930 --> 00:02:33.850
1928 in Toronto, Ontario, Canada.

50
00:02:34.070 --> 00:02:37.410
He was one of three children to George's WGE and Marie Parus.

51
00:02:37.470 --> 00:02:40.930
He adopted James Randy as his name later in life. But for simplicity's sake,

52
00:02:41.170 --> 00:02:44.600
we are going to refer to him like that from now on his skeptical.

53
00:02:44.620 --> 00:02:46.640
And inquiring mind showed up from an early age,

54
00:02:46.840 --> 00:02:50.040
as he routinely got in trouble at Sunday school for constantly asking for proof

55
00:02:50.041 --> 00:02:52.160
while his teacher read things from the Bible,

56
00:02:52.180 --> 00:02:55.160
things went a bit differently in regular school where Randy showed a great

57
00:02:55.161 --> 00:02:56.040
aptitude for learning,

58
00:02:56.140 --> 00:02:59.880
but he advanced so far ahead of his class that eventually he grew bored and

59
00:02:59.881 --> 00:03:03.000
started skipping school, mainly showing up only to take exams.

60
00:03:03.190 --> 00:03:05.160
This provided Randy with a lot of free time,

61
00:03:05.161 --> 00:03:06.720
which he needed to fill with something.

62
00:03:06.820 --> 00:03:10.720
He visited a lot of museums and public libraries and also frequented many Matney

63
00:03:10.721 --> 00:03:11.260
shows.

64
00:03:11.260 --> 00:03:14.440
He went to one when he was 12 years old and forever altered the course of his

65
00:03:14.441 --> 00:03:17.880
life. It was a magic show, performs owner of America's creator stage magicians,

66
00:03:17.881 --> 00:03:22.070
Harry Black stone senior. The experience had an enchanting effect on young rans,

67
00:03:22.230 --> 00:03:25.190
and he now knew what he wanted to do with the rest of his life.

68
00:03:25.260 --> 00:03:28.510
Like most magicians, he started out small, mostly doing kids, birthday parties.

69
00:03:28.730 --> 00:03:32.190
He became successful as a mentalist. And by the time he was 17 years old,

70
00:03:32.200 --> 00:03:34.590
Randy already began performing in local nightclubs.

71
00:03:34.591 --> 00:03:37.030
After dropping out of high school around this time,

72
00:03:37.130 --> 00:03:39.580
he got his first experience as a deep bunker.

73
00:03:39.581 --> 00:03:41.860
When he attended a spirit church in Toronto,

74
00:03:41.870 --> 00:03:45.700
where the preacher claimed to read the minds of his parishioners by predicting

75
00:03:45.701 --> 00:03:49.180
what statements they wrote down on papers placed inside sealed envelopes.

76
00:03:49.181 --> 00:03:53.060
This was accomplished using a simple and common mentalism trick known as one

77
00:03:53.061 --> 00:03:54.620
ahead, which as the name implies,

78
00:03:54.621 --> 00:03:58.340
allows the performer to always learn one factor ahead of the ones that they

79
00:03:58.341 --> 00:03:59.260
present out loud.

80
00:03:59.710 --> 00:04:02.890
All that is necessary for the trick to work is for the mentalist to already know

81
00:04:02.910 --> 00:04:05.130
one of the statements before the performance starts,

82
00:04:05.320 --> 00:04:08.810
this can be accomplished through multiple ways. They could use slight of hands.

83
00:04:08.811 --> 00:04:11.890
They could sneak a peek inside an envelope or simplest of all.

84
00:04:11.891 --> 00:04:15.290
They could have an accomplice in the audience who would say the fake statement

85
00:04:15.291 --> 00:04:17.490
belongs to them, regardless of what it is.

86
00:04:17.790 --> 00:04:21.480
So the mentalist begins their performance by mind reading the first statement,

87
00:04:21.481 --> 00:04:22.300
which is fake.

88
00:04:22.300 --> 00:04:25.760
The plants in the audience says that one's mine and the performer then opens the

89
00:04:25.880 --> 00:04:28.320
envelope, which the audience thinks contains that statements.

90
00:04:28.340 --> 00:04:31.760
But of course it doesn't none of them do, but in doing so,

91
00:04:31.761 --> 00:04:34.920
the mentalist reads and learns the actual statements that was in the envelope.

92
00:04:34.980 --> 00:04:38.640
At that point, the hard work is already done. The mentalist is one ahead.

93
00:04:38.660 --> 00:04:41.310
So he picks up another envelope, opens mind, reads it,

94
00:04:41.311 --> 00:04:44.310
but says the true statements that they learned from the previous one,

95
00:04:44.340 --> 00:04:47.190
this of course will get a positive response from someone in the audience.

96
00:04:47.210 --> 00:04:50.470
So the performer opens the envelope and learns another true statement.

97
00:04:50.610 --> 00:04:52.270
And so it goes until the end.

98
00:04:52.490 --> 00:04:54.950
It doesn't matter if there are five envelopes or 500,

99
00:04:54.970 --> 00:04:58.350
the mentalist can do them all in a row because they will always know one true

100
00:04:58.351 --> 00:04:59.830
statement ahead of the ones presented.

101
00:04:59.940 --> 00:05:02.460
Even though Rensy had been press practicing magic for a few years.

102
00:05:02.480 --> 00:05:03.280
At this point,

103
00:05:03.280 --> 00:05:05.900
he could easily spot the con and got very angry with the preacher.

104
00:05:06.080 --> 00:05:08.740
He looked at the people around him and saw many of them having emotional

105
00:05:08.940 --> 00:05:09.301
reactions.

106
00:05:09.301 --> 00:05:12.460
Some with tears streaming down their face because they truly believed their

107
00:05:12.580 --> 00:05:16.300
preacher had supernatural powers and all the while he was simply deceiving them

108
00:05:16.520 --> 00:05:18.260
for money. Randy ran up on stage,

109
00:05:18.261 --> 00:05:20.780
interrupted the performance and explained how the trick was done.

110
00:05:20.840 --> 00:05:23.730
But there it actually received was not the one he was expecting.

111
00:05:23.790 --> 00:05:24.970
The people were not grateful.

112
00:05:25.320 --> 00:05:28.290
They didn't suddenly realize that they were being lied to. Instead.

113
00:05:28.400 --> 00:05:31.010
They booed the young magician and told him that he was wrong.

114
00:05:31.150 --> 00:05:34.690
The preacher's wife called the police and Randy was arrested for his efforts

115
00:05:34.840 --> 00:05:36.930
that day. He learns a hard but important lesson.

116
00:05:37.070 --> 00:05:41.570
One of the main reasons why everything he deemed woo woo worked so well was deep

117
00:05:41.640 --> 00:05:45.640
down. People wanted to believe in them, even if it meant being deceived,

118
00:05:45.641 --> 00:05:46.640
looking back on it,

119
00:05:46.840 --> 00:05:50.880
James Randy reflected that that was the event that set him on the path of a

120
00:05:50.881 --> 00:05:51.714
professional

121
00:05:58.140 --> 00:06:01.320
For the moment. Randy was still focused on his burgeoning career as a magician,

122
00:06:01.321 --> 00:06:02.600
despite his initial foray.

123
00:06:02.720 --> 00:06:06.080
And mentalism he switched specialties to escapology because people kept on

124
00:06:06.081 --> 00:06:09.480
believing. He had genuine psychic powers, despite his insistence,

125
00:06:09.481 --> 00:06:10.880
that he was merely performing tricks.

126
00:06:11.020 --> 00:06:14.080
He had people walk up to him and ask for blotto numbers or star tips.

127
00:06:14.140 --> 00:06:17.310
And if he said that he was just a magician, they would reply with a sarcastic.

128
00:06:17.980 --> 00:06:21.870
Sure you are with the wink in a nudge. Randy did not like this experience.

129
00:06:21.871 --> 00:06:24.510
He felt uncomfortable. This, he understood the true power.

130
00:06:24.511 --> 00:06:28.110
He held over his audience and how easily it could be abused for fame and fortune

131
00:06:28.410 --> 00:06:32.070
by someone less scrupulous than him throughout the 1950s and sixties.

132
00:06:32.071 --> 00:06:35.230
Randy built up a reputation as one of the most popular magicians in north

133
00:06:35.231 --> 00:06:39.420
America. Although he taught in Europe and Asia, he still wins by his real name.

134
00:06:39.420 --> 00:06:43.100
Randall's wind at this point, although he later changed it to the amazing Randy,

135
00:06:43.110 --> 00:06:44.420
after a Quebec newspaper,

136
00:06:44.660 --> 00:06:48.660
referred to him as let Randy his most popular trick stunts and delusions,

137
00:06:48.720 --> 00:06:52.180
all that and elements of danger to them that kept the audience on its toes.

138
00:06:52.290 --> 00:06:54.460
Even when some of them lasted for over half an hour,

139
00:06:54.470 --> 00:06:56.620
Randy later admitted that at this stage in its career,

140
00:06:56.640 --> 00:07:01.250
he was driven by a desire to outdo Harry Houdini to last longer than him and

141
00:07:01.480 --> 00:07:03.130
make it more dangerous than he did.

142
00:07:03.270 --> 00:07:06.250
One of Randy's most popular stunts took place in 1955.

143
00:07:06.251 --> 00:07:07.690
When he got tied up in a straight jacket,

144
00:07:07.870 --> 00:07:11.530
turned upside down and lifted six stories into the air over Broadway.

145
00:07:11.750 --> 00:07:15.610
He escaped in two and a half minutes and later he would perform a similar daring

146
00:07:15.850 --> 00:07:20.480
feat except that he was hung upside down over Niagara falls in 1974,

147
00:07:20.481 --> 00:07:23.920
Randy said to Guinness world record for staying naked inside a block of eyes for

148
00:07:23.921 --> 00:07:25.200
43 minutes and eight seconds.

149
00:07:25.500 --> 00:07:29.320
All of his successes translated into crossover appeal for Randy who made

150
00:07:29.560 --> 00:07:32.760
numerous TV, radio and stage appearances. During the 1960s,

151
00:07:32.780 --> 00:07:36.760
he was a popular guest on the children's television show wonder ran in 9 73.

152
00:07:36.761 --> 00:07:41.350
He joined Alice Cooper on his bill dollar babies tour appearing in each show as

153
00:07:41.450 --> 00:07:45.230
the executioner who decapitated Cooper using a tri guillotine that he designed.

154
00:07:45.410 --> 00:07:47.150
But really it was one show in particular,

155
00:07:47.240 --> 00:07:49.550
which helped turn Randy into a household name.

156
00:07:49.690 --> 00:07:52.590
The tonight show with Johnny Carson in his younger years,

157
00:07:52.591 --> 00:07:56.470
Carson had trained as a magician and he also shared Randy's skepticism when it

158
00:07:56.471 --> 00:07:58.950
came to supernatural claims, the two formed a close friendship,

159
00:07:59.060 --> 00:08:02.860
and Randy became one of Johnny Carson's favorite guests appearing over 30 times

160
00:08:02.880 --> 00:08:05.460
on the tonight show during Carson's tenure as host.

161
00:08:11.640 --> 00:08:12.270
But of course,

162
00:08:12.270 --> 00:08:15.940
magic did not end up being James Randy's main claim to fame ever since he was a

163
00:08:16.060 --> 00:08:19.220
teenager. He promised that one day when he was famous and did a large platform,

164
00:08:19.240 --> 00:08:23.170
he would use his knowledge and influence to expose the people he perceived as

165
00:08:23.171 --> 00:08:23.990
being dishonest.

166
00:08:23.990 --> 00:08:28.450
It was during the 1970s that Randy's career pivoted from magic focusing mainly

167
00:08:28.710 --> 00:08:30.090
on paranormal investigations.

168
00:08:30.470 --> 00:08:33.410
We cannot say what Randy's first debunking attempt was,

169
00:08:33.510 --> 00:08:37.210
but we can certainly say which one made him famous in 1972,

170
00:08:37.211 --> 00:08:40.680
he began a rivalry that which pretty much last for his entire, their life.

171
00:08:41.100 --> 00:08:44.680
One against Yuri Galler born in Tel Aviv. Galler was at the time,

172
00:08:44.760 --> 00:08:48.480
a popular and charismatic illusionist and mentalist known mainly for his act of

173
00:08:48.481 --> 00:08:51.720
bending spoons, right in front of his audience, simply by holding them. However,

174
00:08:51.900 --> 00:08:55.440
he claimed to do this as well as his other feets by using genuine psychic

175
00:08:55.460 --> 00:08:56.760
powers. This bothered Randy.

176
00:08:56.900 --> 00:09:01.600
So he called out gall and then challenged his powers on an infamous 1973 episode

177
00:09:01.800 --> 00:09:03.480
of the night show. Like we already mentioned,

178
00:09:03.481 --> 00:09:05.120
Johnny Carson was a bit of a skeptic himself.

179
00:09:05.600 --> 00:09:08.600
Fury Gallo was supposed to be a guest on the show and was slated perform his

180
00:09:08.601 --> 00:09:12.440
spoon bending. So Carson asked James Randy for help to prevent any trickery.

181
00:09:12.441 --> 00:09:14.240
Randy solution was pretty straightforward.

182
00:09:14.620 --> 00:09:17.830
Just do not let him use his own spoons. Have the show,

183
00:09:17.831 --> 00:09:22.030
provide the props without telling GU and without letting him or anyone else from

184
00:09:22.031 --> 00:09:25.670
his team handle them prior to the taping. The result was a predictable one,

185
00:09:25.910 --> 00:09:29.790
a slow and embarrassing 20 minute segments where GU failed to make the spoons

186
00:09:29.791 --> 00:09:34.070
even Twitch slightly before finally abandoning the tasks saying that he did not

187
00:09:34.260 --> 00:09:35.780
feel strong that night.

188
00:09:35.960 --> 00:09:39.700
The show was described in the New York times as a legendary emulation in which

189
00:09:40.140 --> 00:09:44.140
gala offered up flustered excuses to his host as his abilities failed him again

190
00:09:44.141 --> 00:09:46.180
and again, I sat there for 22 minutes.

191
00:09:46.310 --> 00:09:48.980
Humiliated gala told me when I spoke to him in September,

192
00:09:49.340 --> 00:09:51.140
I went back to my hotel, devastated.

193
00:09:51.340 --> 00:09:53.940
I was about to pack up the next day and go back to Tel Aviv.

194
00:09:54.140 --> 00:09:56.530
I thought that's it I'm destroyed.

195
00:09:56.710 --> 00:09:59.890
You would think that such a performance would spell the end for gala's career,

196
00:09:59.990 --> 00:10:03.410
but it actually had the opposite effect. It gave it a big boost proof.

197
00:10:03.411 --> 00:10:06.090
Once again, that people want to believe these feets are real.

198
00:10:06.400 --> 00:10:08.970
Even in the face of clear evidence to the contrary,

199
00:10:09.290 --> 00:10:12.010
GU supporters argued that if his spoon bending was just a magic chick,

200
00:10:12.011 --> 00:10:13.810
then surely he'd be able to repeat it every time.

201
00:10:13.920 --> 00:10:18.520
Whereas true psychic powers would be, be more fickle than that weak.

202
00:10:19.780 --> 00:10:21.520
Wow. Therefore in their minds,

203
00:10:21.521 --> 00:10:25.480
the facts that GE could not bend spoons that night was proof that he could bend

204
00:10:25.700 --> 00:10:29.240
spoons. This was only the start of Randy's efforts to debunk DE's claims,

205
00:10:29.340 --> 00:10:30.760
but he faced an uphill battle,

206
00:10:31.120 --> 00:10:33.960
as it seems like people were willing to believe in his supernatural powers,

207
00:10:33.961 --> 00:10:35.680
no matter what. In 19 70,

208
00:10:35.680 --> 00:10:39.510
80 published enough article a new scientist about a Yaha Kad Skylar's former

209
00:10:39.511 --> 00:10:41.990
manager, who first brought him to international fame.

210
00:10:42.310 --> 00:10:45.190
KA described many ways in which he claimed to have helped ke achieve his

211
00:10:45.310 --> 00:10:45.470
illusion,

212
00:10:45.470 --> 00:10:48.950
starting out by simply talking to people to obtain private information,

213
00:10:48.951 --> 00:10:53.830
which he later relayed gall to make it seem like it came to him by E P for a TV

214
00:10:53.831 --> 00:10:57.860
show in San Francisco. Kad said that he secretly looked sealed envelope,

215
00:10:57.861 --> 00:11:00.060
tell gall thes before the start of the show,

216
00:11:00.061 --> 00:11:03.020
during a meeting with the London publisher, KA left the phone off the hook.

217
00:11:03.080 --> 00:11:07.020
So Gallo could hear what was being said from a different room during a live show

218
00:11:07.021 --> 00:11:07.660
in Birmingham,

219
00:11:07.660 --> 00:11:10.980
he alleged to a faked bomb scare so that Gallo would not have to perform after

220
00:11:10.981 --> 00:11:13.980
finding out that the front row of the audience consisted mainly of professional

221
00:11:13.981 --> 00:11:16.420
magicians. This was not enough to convince the true believers though.

222
00:11:16.440 --> 00:11:20.610
The 1975 wrote a whole book titled the magic of Yuri Gallo,

223
00:11:20.611 --> 00:11:23.450
which challenged the psychics claims of paranormal powers.

224
00:11:23.710 --> 00:11:25.170
But that was still not enough.

225
00:11:25.310 --> 00:11:28.290
If Randy was going to get serious about his career as a professional skeptic,

226
00:11:28.830 --> 00:11:29.810
he was gonna need help.

227
00:11:35.880 --> 00:11:40.400
Magicians have a longstanding tradit of debunking. Even prior to James Randy.

228
00:11:40.580 --> 00:11:41.361
In his later years,

229
00:11:41.361 --> 00:11:44.600
Harry Houdini became an art and enemy of mediums who claimed to speak with the

230
00:11:44.760 --> 00:11:47.720
debt before him. One of the 20th century, most influential magicians,

231
00:11:47.750 --> 00:11:52.400
John Neville Maline began his career by exposing two spiritualist brothers who

232
00:11:52.401 --> 00:11:55.920
performed delusions and claimed to have supernatural powers after Randy's time.

233
00:11:55.921 --> 00:11:59.760
He passed the bat to other performers, such as pen and tell or banner check.

234
00:11:59.910 --> 00:12:01.360
That being said in his own time,

235
00:12:01.361 --> 00:12:04.800
Randy didn't exactly receive unwavering support from his fellow magicians for

236
00:12:04.801 --> 00:12:05.840
his investigative efforts.

237
00:12:05.841 --> 00:12:09.080
Some were annoyed that he was exposing so many tricks of the trade while others

238
00:12:09.270 --> 00:12:11.280
were content with knowing the truth for themselves.

239
00:12:11.380 --> 00:12:15.750
And didn't see the point in going to all that trouble to reveal others' frauds.

240
00:12:15.751 --> 00:12:18.030
Therefore Brandy sought assistance from other fields,

241
00:12:18.031 --> 00:12:20.630
particularly the scientific community who was by and large,

242
00:12:20.660 --> 00:12:24.630
also against claims of paranormal phenomena in 1976, James Randy,

243
00:12:24.631 --> 00:12:28.270
co-founded the committee for the scientific investigation of claims of the

244
00:12:28.271 --> 00:12:30.070
paranormal or CSI cop,

245
00:12:30.071 --> 00:12:34.580
which later changed its name to the Pithia committee for skeptical inquiry or

246
00:12:34.920 --> 00:12:37.700
CSI. The organization promoted scientific skepticism,

247
00:12:37.710 --> 00:12:40.060
especially when it came to claims of the paranormal.

248
00:12:40.120 --> 00:12:43.700
But it also personally investigated numerous claims of such supernatural

249
00:12:43.701 --> 00:12:47.260
activities. Besides Randy other founders included professor Paul Kurtz,

250
00:12:47.261 --> 00:12:51.060
who came up with the idea for psych op professors, Ray Hyman and Marcello,

251
00:12:51.380 --> 00:12:52.213
Tru psychologist,

252
00:12:52.480 --> 00:12:57.130
BF Skinner writer as Isaac Amar and Martin Gardner and astronomer Carl Sagan of

253
00:12:57.290 --> 00:13:00.730
them all James Randy was the one most willing to travel the globe to debunk

254
00:13:00.731 --> 00:13:02.850
fraudulent claims. And according to Hyman,

255
00:13:02.860 --> 00:13:06.610
Randy became the ambassador of psycho ands the face of the skeptical movement

256
00:13:06.611 --> 00:13:07.430
all over the world.

257
00:13:07.430 --> 00:13:11.530
One of Randy's most famous cases as an investigator was the so-called Ben Veni

258
00:13:11.850 --> 00:13:13.890
death in 1988, French immunology,

259
00:13:14.560 --> 00:13:16.920
Ja Ben published a paper in nature.

260
00:13:17.100 --> 00:13:20.760
One of the most prestigious science journals in the world where he presented his

261
00:13:20.830 --> 00:13:22.400
idea of memory of water,

262
00:13:22.570 --> 00:13:25.840
which by and large supported the concept of homeopathy.

263
00:13:25.840 --> 00:13:29.040
This suggestion was immediately met with raised eyebrows from the scientific

264
00:13:29.041 --> 00:13:33.280
community. So an independent committee was sent to verify Bennet day's results.

265
00:13:33.500 --> 00:13:37.310
The committee consisted to for fraud investigator or to Stewart nature editor,

266
00:13:37.500 --> 00:13:40.710
John Maddox and James Randy. They could not replicate the results.

267
00:13:40.730 --> 00:13:44.470
And the journal dismissed the original article with Ben VE day portraying

268
00:13:44.471 --> 00:13:46.230
himself as the victim of a witch hunt.

269
00:13:46.231 --> 00:13:49.070
Another of Randy's biggest targets was Peter Popoff.

270
00:13:49.071 --> 00:13:53.230
One of America's most popular televangelist during the 1980s who made a fortune

271
00:13:53.460 --> 00:13:54.750
from acts of faith,

272
00:13:54.990 --> 00:13:58.460
healing pop off would often call out attendees saying their names and their

273
00:13:58.461 --> 00:14:00.300
illnesses in front of a stunned audience.

274
00:14:00.370 --> 00:14:02.700
This was information he claimed to have received divinely,

275
00:14:02.701 --> 00:14:06.380
but Randy showed that it was simply fed to him by his wife through a hidden air

276
00:14:06.580 --> 00:14:07.780
piece. Before his show started,

277
00:14:07.880 --> 00:14:11.020
Popoff collected this information either by having plants in the audience who

278
00:14:11.130 --> 00:14:12.540
chatted with the people around them,

279
00:14:12.560 --> 00:14:16.570
or by having attendees fill out prayer cards with all the details he needed.

280
00:14:16.680 --> 00:14:18.010
Once Randy had the evidence,

281
00:14:18.011 --> 00:14:21.610
he again turned Johnny Carson who was more than happy to expose pop a on the

282
00:14:21.611 --> 00:14:25.410
tonight show. This led to a ton of negative publicity for the televangelist.

283
00:14:25.430 --> 00:14:29.490
And he declared bankruptcy in 1987 and yet Randy's most notable act.

284
00:14:29.491 --> 00:14:31.730
And arguably his most controversial was something.

285
00:14:31.731 --> 00:14:35.450
He called project alpha instead of an investigation targeting specific

286
00:14:35.451 --> 00:14:36.480
paranormal claims.

287
00:14:36.590 --> 00:14:40.320
This was more of a hoax meant to show the world that scientists could be just as

288
00:14:40.321 --> 00:14:43.160
easily fooled by skilled tricks as everybody else,

289
00:14:43.161 --> 00:14:46.080
because they are not used to dealing with intentional deception.

290
00:14:46.340 --> 00:14:48.840
The whole thing started in 1979 when James McDonald,

291
00:14:48.900 --> 00:14:53.120
the engineer and chairman of McDonald Douglas aircraft used a $500,000 grant to

292
00:14:53.121 --> 00:14:55.880
establish the McDonald laboratory for psychical research.

293
00:14:56.100 --> 00:14:58.120
As McDonald was a believer in the paranormal,

294
00:14:58.121 --> 00:15:01.960
those who shared his views expected this move to finally legitimize research

295
00:15:02.030 --> 00:15:03.520
into parapsychology. At first,

296
00:15:03.800 --> 00:15:06.720
Ren reached out to them with advice on how to create an efficient methodology

297
00:15:06.900 --> 00:15:10.360
and how to avoid getting con even offered to act as a supervisor for the

298
00:15:10.510 --> 00:15:12.270
experiments, but his help was rebuffed.

299
00:15:12.270 --> 00:15:15.830
He then set out on a different path intending to prove that the methodology used

300
00:15:15.930 --> 00:15:18.510
by the lab was floored and susceptible to trickery.

301
00:15:18.530 --> 00:15:22.390
He did this with the help of two teenage magicians named Michael Edwards and

302
00:15:22.391 --> 00:15:23.210
Steve shore.

303
00:15:23.210 --> 00:15:26.470
The latter would ultimately adopt the stage name banner check and has become one

304
00:15:26.471 --> 00:15:28.190
of Randy's most prominent proteges,

305
00:15:28.191 --> 00:15:30.670
even serving as the director for Randy's foundation.

306
00:15:30.671 --> 00:15:34.380
But for now he and Edwards were just two skilled mentalists who were opposing as

307
00:15:34.381 --> 00:15:35.940
psychics, unsurprisingly.

308
00:15:35.941 --> 00:15:39.620
They soon became prize subjects at the McDonald laboratory with nobody else

309
00:15:39.621 --> 00:15:42.340
getting results anywhere close to them. According to Ren,

310
00:15:42.520 --> 00:15:45.660
one important elements of project Arthur was that Sean Edwards would answer

311
00:15:45.661 --> 00:15:49.060
truthfully if they were ever asked if they were cheating and they would come

312
00:15:49.061 --> 00:15:50.460
clean about the entire hoax.

313
00:15:50.780 --> 00:15:54.650
Apparently they were never a asked this once during the entire four years that

314
00:15:54.651 --> 00:15:55.850
they served as test subjects.

315
00:15:55.850 --> 00:15:59.890
Eventually Randy revealed the deception in 1983 in an issue of discover magazine

316
00:16:00.450 --> 00:16:03.810
reactions to the hoax were mixed and ranged from one extreme to the other,

317
00:16:03.840 --> 00:16:07.170
some heavily criticized Randy for the deception while others praised him and

318
00:16:07.171 --> 00:16:10.010
pointed out that it had accomplished exactly what it set out to do.

319
00:16:10.011 --> 00:16:14.120
Showing that scientists were not in foul and that they are not trained to deal

320
00:16:14.121 --> 00:16:14.940
with cons.

321
00:16:14.940 --> 00:16:18.800
His fellow SYOP members calls it a landmark moments in the scientific study of

322
00:16:18.801 --> 00:16:20.200
paranormal phenomena. Meanwhile,

323
00:16:20.220 --> 00:16:23.280
the McDonald lab lost its funding was shut down a couple of years later,

324
00:16:29.760 --> 00:16:32.480
Although Ren was a prominent member of SYOP. It was his involvement with,

325
00:16:32.710 --> 00:16:35.470
of a different organization that brought him even more notoriety,

326
00:16:35.550 --> 00:16:38.710
particularly within the paranormal community. In 1996,

327
00:16:38.711 --> 00:16:41.110
he founded that James Randy educational foundation,

328
00:16:41.170 --> 00:16:46.030
or J R E F the company's missions were to continue investigating paranormal

329
00:16:46.031 --> 00:16:49.790
and other pseudo scientific claims while educating the public about skepticism

330
00:16:50.090 --> 00:16:51.030
and critical thinking.

331
00:16:51.130 --> 00:16:55.220
The J R E F did lots of D to advance its goals for over a decade.

332
00:16:55.480 --> 00:16:59.100
It hosted the largest annual conference of skeptics known as the amazing

333
00:16:59.101 --> 00:17:02.980
meeting. It also gave out the Pegasus award semi-regular trophies,

334
00:17:02.981 --> 00:17:06.300
mockingly offered to the biggest peds of woo woo of that year.

335
00:17:06.360 --> 00:17:09.980
But the thing it is most famous for is the $1 million challenge,

336
00:17:09.990 --> 00:17:14.010
which would've paid out a prize of a million dollars to anyone who could exhibit

337
00:17:14.060 --> 00:17:16.490
paranormal abilities under lab conditions.

338
00:17:16.630 --> 00:17:20.770
The idea first started in 1964 during a radio show when Randy was challenged by

339
00:17:20.771 --> 00:17:24.530
a para psychologist to put his money where his mouth is, Randy agreed.

340
00:17:24.770 --> 00:17:25.970
Although the prize was of course,

341
00:17:25.971 --> 00:17:29.050
much smaller back then he offered a thousand dollars to anyone who could show

342
00:17:29.170 --> 00:17:33.130
him supernatural powers during a control test. Randy liked the idea after all,

343
00:17:33.131 --> 00:17:36.200
what better way was the there for someone with genuine powers to prove

344
00:17:36.201 --> 00:17:37.520
themselves than by humiliating.

345
00:17:37.540 --> 00:17:40.760
One of the country's leading skeptics and walking away with his money.

346
00:17:41.080 --> 00:17:44.080
He soon up the offer to $10,000. Then during the late 1980s,

347
00:17:44.081 --> 00:17:47.280
he was part of a television program where the prize was increased to a hundred

348
00:17:47.520 --> 00:17:48.200
thousand dollars.

349
00:17:48.200 --> 00:17:51.320
Although the rest of the money was supplied by the broadcasting company.

350
00:17:51.410 --> 00:17:54.880
Eventually thanks to a donation by internet entrepreneur, Rick Adams,

351
00:17:54.890 --> 00:17:59.520
Randy permanently increased the prize to a million dollars ever since the 1960s

352
00:17:59.521 --> 00:18:02.200
around a thousand people have tried taking Randy up on his offer.

353
00:18:02.201 --> 00:18:03.720
According to the official guidelines,

354
00:18:03.820 --> 00:18:07.920
the exact circumstances of the tests were agreed upon in advance by both parties

355
00:18:08.510 --> 00:18:11.110
afterwards could not be changed no matter what.

356
00:18:11.260 --> 00:18:14.630
This was a big sticking point with Randy who argued that way too often.

357
00:18:14.840 --> 00:18:18.390
Other supposedly scientific studies skewed their results in favor of the

358
00:18:18.391 --> 00:18:22.630
paranormal by accepting various excuses from their subjects and allowing them to

359
00:18:22.631 --> 00:18:25.030
change the tests on the fly under his stricter rules,

360
00:18:25.340 --> 00:18:28.430
none of the applicants have even pass the preliminary tests,

361
00:18:28.431 --> 00:18:32.380
which performed before the formal test that would certify the results most have

362
00:18:32.381 --> 00:18:35.620
failed. It, others have just refused to take it. Randy's money.

363
00:18:35.621 --> 00:18:39.020
Challenges lasted for decades, but went unclaimed in 2015,

364
00:18:39.021 --> 00:18:43.460
the 87 year old Randy retired from everything from investigations from the J R E

365
00:18:43.500 --> 00:18:46.260
F. It was decided that it was about time that the money was put to better use.

366
00:18:46.261 --> 00:18:50.770
So the $1 million challenge was discontinued and instead J R E F now awards,

367
00:18:50.870 --> 00:18:54.010
grants to deserving people and nonprofits. As for James Randy,

368
00:18:54.110 --> 00:18:57.970
he lived out his remaining years, quietly before passing away in 2020 age,

369
00:18:57.971 --> 00:18:59.410
92 half jokingly.

370
00:18:59.411 --> 00:19:02.930
He mentioned that his final wish would be to be cremated and have his ashes

371
00:19:03.130 --> 00:19:04.330
thrown in Yuri gala's eyes.

372
00:19:07.080 --> 00:19:08.380
So I really hope you enjoyed this video.
