00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:03.330
<v 0>You guys are probably never going to get tired of world war, two subjects.</v>

2
00:00:03.331 --> 00:00:06.870
And one thing I'm never gonna get tired of is my Vesey shoes,

3
00:00:06.871 --> 00:00:09.180
which happens to be the sponsor of today's video.

4
00:00:09.240 --> 00:00:13.260
And I'll take them off right now and show you. Look, do you like a good sneaker?

5
00:00:13.470 --> 00:00:18.450
Well, something we call trainers in the UK. Do you like a good boot in winter?

6
00:00:18.460 --> 00:00:19.770
Well, obviously this isn't a boot,

7
00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:22.830
but the incredible thing is it acts like it because it's not just water

8
00:00:22.831 --> 00:00:24.840
resistant. This is waterproof.

9
00:00:24.870 --> 00:00:28.890
I shot some footage of me pouring a lot of water on these things and you can see

10
00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:31.830
how it just flies off. It's pretty incredible.

11
00:00:31.860 --> 00:00:35.520
Also offering unparalleled comfort and dryness,

12
00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:37.890
regardless of the conditions outside. Now,

13
00:00:37.891 --> 00:00:41.640
I hear somebody saying Simon I've had water resistant shoes before,

14
00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:46.110
but having had water proof shoes, properly waterproof sneakers,

15
00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:47.783
tapestries, trainers,

16
00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:50.850
whatever you want to call these also easy to clean up and wearing them for a few

17
00:00:50.851 --> 00:00:53.430
days. See this a little bit of dust on the front there.

18
00:00:53.700 --> 00:00:56.910
We just wipe it off easy. It's made for something called [inaudible],

19
00:00:56.911 --> 00:01:00.960
which is this really comfortable net that keeps you warm in the winter and cool

20
00:01:01.290 --> 00:01:05.190
in the summit. Vessey has an incredible early black Friday offer right now.

you can use the code.

24
00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:17.220
Biograph is a checkout and you'll get $25 off your next pair of shoes.

25
00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:21.030
So let's head over to 20th century Britain for today's subjects.

26
00:01:27.050 --> 00:01:30.710
If you'd been watching British politics in the early 1930s, chances are,

27
00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:34.940
they would have been one name on your lips. Oswald Mosley was handsome,

28
00:01:34.970 --> 00:01:37.040
charismatic, known for setting crowds,

29
00:01:37.041 --> 00:01:41.960
alight with his passionate speeches and aristocrats with a huge working class

30
00:01:41.961 --> 00:01:42.440
following.

31
00:01:42.440 --> 00:01:46.820
He was perhaps the only politician able to unite voters of both major parties

32
00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:49.220
regularly tipped as a future prime minister.

33
00:01:49.221 --> 00:01:52.460
It was sad that he could one day be Britain's greatest leader,

34
00:01:52.610 --> 00:01:54.080
but that never happens. Instead.

35
00:01:54.440 --> 00:01:57.650
Mosley chose Jake his career down a much more dangerous path.

36
00:01:58.130 --> 00:02:03.080
The path marked fascism as Burson's leading fascist Moseley was able to command

37
00:02:03.230 --> 00:02:05.360
all. And he's a black Schutz. He received funding from,

38
00:02:05.470 --> 00:02:08.930
with selenium was friends without off Hitler had the Nazis conquered Britain.

39
00:02:08.960 --> 00:02:13.250
He would have almost certainly been made the ruler of a fascist UK state instead

40
00:02:13.251 --> 00:02:15.230
of this one time, but let's go superstar story,

41
00:02:15.350 --> 00:02:20.060
his career and reputation destroyed and the firestorm of world war one,

42
00:02:20.210 --> 00:02:23.420
a joke to some, a dire warning from the past to others.

43
00:02:23.600 --> 00:02:26.510
This is the life of Oswald Mosley. Hitler's man.

44
00:02:27.080 --> 00:02:27.913
<v 1>Bridget.</v>

45
00:02:33.380 --> 00:02:35.870
<v 0>A man who would one day start himself a champion of the poor.</v>

46
00:02:35.990 --> 00:02:39.410
I was well Mosley's backgrounds couldn't have been more privileged born in

47
00:02:39.411 --> 00:02:41.570
London on November the 16th, 1896.

48
00:02:41.571 --> 00:02:44.630
He came from a family embedded in the aristocracy.

49
00:02:44.690 --> 00:02:47.870
His grandfather also Oswald Mosley was a Baroness. Well,

50
00:02:48.050 --> 00:02:52.760
his father also confusingly called Oswald Mosley was a rich Playboy. And yes,

51
00:02:52.790 --> 00:02:56.720
that's way too many. Oswell Mosley's running around for one video.

52
00:02:56.750 --> 00:03:00.670
Luckily the three Oswald's were mostly known by their family. Nicknames.

53
00:03:00.700 --> 00:03:05.440
Grandpa Mosley was John bull. Well, baby noseley was known as Tom still,

54
00:03:05.470 --> 00:03:08.740
despite his privileged status life wasn't easy for Tom Mosley.

55
00:03:08.770 --> 00:03:13.030
His father was a serial adulterer bully who belittled his son, mercilessly.

56
00:03:13.120 --> 00:03:16.870
The abuse got so bad that Moseley's mum board took the boy and went to live with

57
00:03:16.871 --> 00:03:20.710
grandpa. John Balwyn. Tom was only five there. The boy was spoiled. Rotten.

58
00:03:20.770 --> 00:03:23.770
John bull apparently saw Mosley as an ideal replacement for his own

59
00:03:23.771 --> 00:03:27.550
disappointing son while Maude regarded him as both the son and to substitute

60
00:03:28.060 --> 00:03:31.750
husband's calling him this old man Childs. It was men's affectionately,

61
00:03:31.810 --> 00:03:33.640
but the image it conjures of a grown man,

62
00:03:33.641 --> 00:03:36.700
acting like a spoiled kid would be speaky precedents.

63
00:03:36.790 --> 00:03:40.600
The rest of those of these childhood past like that of any aristocrat before

64
00:03:40.601 --> 00:03:44.350
turning Danny was sent away to preparatory school. And from there to Winchester,

65
00:03:44.410 --> 00:03:48.610
he became a competent boxer and a world-class fencer before heading to sound

66
00:03:48.970 --> 00:03:50.950
test at 16 to train for the military by now,

67
00:03:51.340 --> 00:03:55.480
Mosley had grown into a tall athletic young man with movie star looks had also

68
00:03:55.481 --> 00:03:59.260
grown into something of a colossal of Santos.

69
00:03:59.290 --> 00:04:02.590
He became notorious for getting drunk and sneaking into town to pick fights

70
00:04:02.591 --> 00:04:03.100
with,

71
00:04:03.100 --> 00:04:07.510
or sometimes just beat up the little classes after one rowdy brawl with another

72
00:04:07.511 --> 00:04:08.920
student, he was even suspended,

73
00:04:09.010 --> 00:04:12.730
but he wouldn't spend long cooling his heels because the British military was

74
00:04:12.731 --> 00:04:14.890
bound to need every able-bodied man.

75
00:04:14.891 --> 00:04:18.160
It could get when world war one broke out in summer 1914,

76
00:04:18.280 --> 00:04:21.700
mostly it was immediately recalled volunteering for the Royal flying Corps.

77
00:04:21.700 --> 00:04:25.120
He trained as a pilot and by Christmas was flying reconnaissance over enemy

78
00:04:25.121 --> 00:04:29.110
lines with airplane technology in its infancy. This was a dangerous job,

79
00:04:29.170 --> 00:04:32.440
but it wouldn't be while on some urgent mission that Moseley sustained his

80
00:04:32.441 --> 00:04:36.730
lifelong injury. In early 1915, Tom was doing training flights of shore.

81
00:04:36.731 --> 00:04:40.000
And when his mother came to watch wanting to show off a mummy,

82
00:04:40.001 --> 00:04:43.480
the man-child tried a difficult maneuver and send the plane crashing to earth.

83
00:04:43.750 --> 00:04:46.330
It took a year of operations to save his broken leg,

84
00:04:46.870 --> 00:04:50.800
even Mosley with a permanent limp. After that it was desk duty. Still.

85
00:04:50.950 --> 00:04:53.860
This was no bad thing sent to work for the foreign office.

86
00:04:54.220 --> 00:04:58.300
Mosley found himself in the London denuded of young men with Olympia could pass

87
00:04:58.301 --> 00:05:01.570
off as a sexy war wound. And so while most men,

88
00:05:01.571 --> 00:05:03.310
his age were fighting in the trenches, Mosley,

89
00:05:03.311 --> 00:05:05.980
spenders evenings leaping into the beds of society, women.

90
00:05:06.280 --> 00:05:10.270
And so he spent his days charming that rich and powerful fathers by 1918,

91
00:05:10.271 --> 00:05:12.760
he was firmly connected to Britain's political elite.

92
00:05:13.120 --> 00:05:14.890
And that was fortunate with the war over.

93
00:05:14.891 --> 00:05:18.370
It was time for the UK to hold its first election. In years,

94
00:05:18.520 --> 00:05:22.240
the election of 1918 is known as the coupon election because the coalition

95
00:05:22.241 --> 00:05:24.310
government sent out lists of candidates.

96
00:05:24.311 --> 00:05:27.790
It felt it supported the war efforts for public. Still flushed with victory.

97
00:05:27.820 --> 00:05:31.630
Seeing a candidates name on these coupon lists was a sign that they were a

98
00:05:31.631 --> 00:05:34.450
Patriot most coupon candidates on their seats.

99
00:05:34.750 --> 00:05:38.110
I want to guess who managed to finagle his name onto that list? Well,

100
00:05:38.140 --> 00:05:40.240
that December age, just 22,

101
00:05:40.241 --> 00:05:43.120
Tom Mosley was elected a conservative member of parliament.

102
00:05:43.210 --> 00:05:47.020
It was the beginning of one of the wildest political rise and falls.

103
00:05:47.470 --> 00:05:49.330
The great Britain has ever seen.

104
00:05:55.620 --> 00:05:59.120
If the previous decade had seen farting around enjoying life,

105
00:05:59.150 --> 00:06:03.440
the 1920s would see them laser focused on advancing in May, 1920.

106
00:06:03.560 --> 00:06:06.860
He strategically married upward. So do you sing the daughter of Lord Curzon,

107
00:06:07.090 --> 00:06:10.030
the King and queen attended that wedding,

108
00:06:10.240 --> 00:06:12.940
but it felt little love for poor lady, Cynthia.

109
00:06:13.030 --> 00:06:15.880
Although she bore in three children, he was serially unfaithful.

110
00:06:15.881 --> 00:06:20.410
So juicing both our sister and stepmother still treating his wife like trash

111
00:06:20.411 --> 00:06:23.080
didn't stop Mosley star from rising in the comments.

112
00:06:23.081 --> 00:06:25.990
He began attaching himself to a highly visible underdog causes.

113
00:06:26.170 --> 00:06:28.090
When one of those causes was Irish independence.

114
00:06:28.091 --> 00:06:32.110
His own party became so hostile that Moseley quit sitting as an independent,

115
00:06:32.170 --> 00:06:35.790
but it soon find a new political home. In December of 1923 Britain,

116
00:06:36.190 --> 00:06:38.800
second election in 13 months produced a shock outcome.

117
00:06:38.980 --> 00:06:42.010
The conservatives lost their healthy majority and second place finisher.

118
00:06:42.040 --> 00:06:46.270
Ramsey McDonald was able to form the first labor government in UK history.

119
00:06:46.330 --> 00:06:50.050
Although it was a minority government momentum suddenly seemed to be with labor

120
00:06:50.320 --> 00:06:53.980
in March Mosley the policy, and it felt like a shrewd career move,

121
00:06:54.100 --> 00:06:57.850
but then came the snap election yeah. Of October,

122
00:06:57.850 --> 00:07:00.850
1924 and Mosley watched in horror as the labor vote collapsed,

123
00:07:01.060 --> 00:07:03.130
not only needed the conservatives win a landslide,

124
00:07:03.160 --> 00:07:07.150
but Mosley lost his seat to Neville Chamberlain. It's easy to imagine.

125
00:07:07.510 --> 00:07:11.050
Moseley now crawling back to the Tories, his tail between his legs.

126
00:07:11.260 --> 00:07:12.430
That's unexpectedly, Tom,

127
00:07:12.520 --> 00:07:15.040
that stuck with this new party over the next few years,

128
00:07:15.041 --> 00:07:19.390
he underwent a rapid transformation from lay about TOF to outspoken friend of

129
00:07:19.391 --> 00:07:21.370
the people he taught British slums,

130
00:07:21.371 --> 00:07:24.280
where he deployed the condition of working class housing.

131
00:07:24.400 --> 00:07:26.230
During the general strike of 1926,

132
00:07:26.231 --> 00:07:28.870
he paid the wages of striking miners from his own pocket,

133
00:07:28.930 --> 00:07:32.140
even traveled to the U S and spent time with Franklin D Roosevelt.

134
00:07:32.170 --> 00:07:33.190
So the rumors,

135
00:07:33.220 --> 00:07:36.550
he followed this with a trip to Birmingham and to meet a family of flat cap

136
00:07:36.910 --> 00:07:39.040
bearing gangsters remained unsubstantiated.

137
00:07:39.250 --> 00:07:40.630
The fall along Moseley was convinced,

138
00:07:40.631 --> 00:07:43.210
had identified Britain's problems to his minds.

139
00:07:43.211 --> 00:07:46.420
International finance was the driving force to the misery.

140
00:07:46.421 --> 00:07:49.270
He saw all around him as he polished his speaking style,

141
00:07:49.271 --> 00:07:51.490
becoming a master at whipping up listeners' emotions,

142
00:07:52.000 --> 00:07:55.750
mostly began to preach that a command economy was the only way forward and labor

143
00:07:55.751 --> 00:07:58.420
was the only party that could deliver it on this front.

144
00:07:58.600 --> 00:08:02.830
It'd be sorely disappointed in the spring of 1929 Britain's election returns,

145
00:08:02.831 --> 00:08:04.930
another near win for labor. Once again,

146
00:08:04.960 --> 00:08:07.480
the party formed and minority governments by now,

147
00:08:07.481 --> 00:08:10.030
and labor stalwarts mostly entered the new government.

148
00:08:10.031 --> 00:08:13.810
Assuming it gets a plum post like foreign secretary when he was instead placed

149
00:08:13.811 --> 00:08:15.940
in an advisory role outside cabinets,

150
00:08:16.120 --> 00:08:19.930
he threw what could only be described as the man-child tantrum to end all

151
00:08:19.931 --> 00:08:22.540
tantrums, but mostly soon realized his new job,

152
00:08:22.660 --> 00:08:26.650
but designing schemes to stimulate employments the perfect inroad for his

153
00:08:26.651 --> 00:08:31.120
theories as the great depression bit that Windsor mostly drafted proposals for

154
00:08:31.240 --> 00:08:34.810
investment in public works for a protectionist market. Unfortunately,

155
00:08:34.811 --> 00:08:37.840
the prime minister was less than enthused. Anyway,

156
00:08:37.850 --> 00:08:42.070
1930 Ramsey McDonald got tired of all of Mosley's proposals and basically told

157
00:08:42.130 --> 00:08:45.670
him, dude, your ideas suck. You suck angio.

158
00:08:45.671 --> 00:08:50.320
Suckiness is making me look bad, just please stop it. It was the end.

159
00:08:50.490 --> 00:08:52.150
So the lion for Moseley hands,

160
00:08:52.151 --> 00:08:56.640
the governments shortly after Mosley resigned with a passionate hour long speech

161
00:08:56.641 --> 00:08:59.640
in the commons that electrified the press in the aftermath,

162
00:08:59.670 --> 00:09:03.690
people began openly saying that Moseley was right, that he was the fresh face.

163
00:09:03.780 --> 00:09:07.380
You should be leading the labor party, not stuffy old Ramsey, MacDonald.

164
00:09:07.770 --> 00:09:09.690
He was even tipped as a future prime minister,

165
00:09:09.870 --> 00:09:12.680
his ideas being just the thing the country needed,

166
00:09:12.810 --> 00:09:16.050
but Mosley's ideas were about to get a whole lot crazy.

167
00:09:16.130 --> 00:09:16.963
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

168
00:09:22.460 --> 00:09:24.470
<v 0>And politics. They say that timing is everything.</v>

169
00:09:24.471 --> 00:09:28.490
And in 1930 Oswald Mosley was convinced his time had come across the, uh,

170
00:09:28.550 --> 00:09:31.430
he sounded out labor MPS about a brand new party.

171
00:09:31.640 --> 00:09:35.390
One far closer to the working people than McDonald's stuffy labor.

172
00:09:35.480 --> 00:09:36.230
At the same time,

173
00:09:36.230 --> 00:09:39.920
he courted conservatives with economic proposals grounded in exploiting the

174
00:09:40.310 --> 00:09:43.100
Empire's colonies. When he published his Moseley manifesto,

175
00:09:43.130 --> 00:09:44.900
people as varied as HG Wells,

176
00:09:44.930 --> 00:09:48.710
John Maynard Keynes and future conservative prime minister, Harold Macmillan,

177
00:09:48.920 --> 00:09:51.770
all expressed interest. Finally in spring of 1931,

178
00:09:52.160 --> 00:09:56.030
Moseley decided to strike taking a donation of 50,000 pounds from a motorcar

179
00:09:56.031 --> 00:09:56.541
magnate.

180
00:09:56.541 --> 00:10:01.100
He used it to found a new populist party imaginatively called the new

181
00:10:01.101 --> 00:10:05.210
party consisting of Moseley five rebel, labor MPS, and one rebel conservative.

182
00:10:05.330 --> 00:10:06.380
It was a humble beginning,

183
00:10:06.530 --> 00:10:10.490
but great things can grow from small seeds and Mosley stock was rising,

184
00:10:10.491 --> 00:10:13.850
especially among those already feeling the depressions pinch.

185
00:10:14.000 --> 00:10:16.970
It's not too hard to imagine how Mosley could have really seized. This moment.

186
00:10:17.090 --> 00:10:21.290
Turn themself into the charismatic leader had always felt himself to be instead

187
00:10:21.291 --> 00:10:23.090
of the young heiress to crash and watched in shock.

188
00:10:23.091 --> 00:10:27.140
As that moment slipped through his fingers just as the new party launched Mosley

189
00:10:27.141 --> 00:10:29.240
was hospitalized for six weeks with pneumonia.

190
00:10:29.330 --> 00:10:32.510
By the time that did recovered the party's moments in the spotlight had already

191
00:10:32.511 --> 00:10:33.260
come and gone.

192
00:10:33.260 --> 00:10:36.920
The only ones still paying attention with the communists who were seriously

193
00:10:37.340 --> 00:10:38.300
about the new party.

194
00:10:38.510 --> 00:10:42.230
Stepping on that tough when Mosley tried to regain his momentum by holding mass

195
00:10:42.231 --> 00:10:46.100
meetings and working class areas that the communists caused massive disruption.

196
00:10:46.190 --> 00:10:50.420
So mostly hard protection again of hoodlums led by the boxer kid Lewis.

197
00:10:50.570 --> 00:10:52.460
This would be the end of the new party.

198
00:10:52.580 --> 00:10:56.330
The stewards Lewis recruited were young tough men who were super enthused about

199
00:10:56.331 --> 00:10:57.380
beating out the commies.

200
00:10:57.560 --> 00:11:01.280
And that's the era hardcore anti-communists tended to be on the extreme, right?

201
00:11:01.490 --> 00:11:03.230
As more of them joined Mosley's army,

202
00:11:03.231 --> 00:11:05.930
it was hard to waive the smell of fascism away,

203
00:11:06.350 --> 00:11:10.010
but the deadliest blow came that summer with the country in chaos, Ramsey,

204
00:11:10.490 --> 00:11:12.500
MacDonald abandoned his minority administration.

205
00:11:12.650 --> 00:11:16.460
Instead he embraced the conservative and liberal parties in a national

206
00:11:16.461 --> 00:11:19.560
governments. When he put this new government to the electorate at one,

207
00:11:19.580 --> 00:11:23.330
the biggest landslide win in UK history. The new Pallinti by contrast,

208
00:11:23.450 --> 00:11:27.170
didn't win a single seat in the aftermath of his humiliating defeat,

209
00:11:27.590 --> 00:11:31.340
Mosley abandoned regular politics. He went to broad looking for inspiration.

210
00:11:31.700 --> 00:11:33.620
His first stop miscellaneous Italy.

211
00:11:33.830 --> 00:11:35.900
Although the new party had flirted with fascism.

212
00:11:35.901 --> 00:11:39.620
It wasn't until Mosley saw a genuine fascist state in action that he fully

213
00:11:39.621 --> 00:11:43.280
embraced far-right politics shortly after Mosley was at a party when he got

214
00:11:43.281 --> 00:11:44.450
chatting to a young woman.

215
00:11:44.570 --> 00:11:47.120
Most of these new passion for fascism blew the girl's mind.

216
00:11:47.390 --> 00:11:48.650
She fell madly in love with him.

217
00:11:48.830 --> 00:11:53.410
That young woman was Diana Mitford and meeting Mosley would change her life in

218
00:11:53.411 --> 00:11:57.640
autumn 1932 Mosley at last did the inevitable, the British union of fascists.

219
00:11:57.641 --> 00:11:59.650
So B U F was founded on October.

220
00:11:59.651 --> 00:12:03.400
The first surrounded by former new party thugs decked out in black shirts,

221
00:12:03.850 --> 00:12:06.010
Mosley declared his true colors to the world.

222
00:12:06.100 --> 00:12:09.580
It was the final end of Oswald Mosley, the man who would be prime minister.

223
00:12:09.700 --> 00:12:13.360
And it was the beginning of Oswald Mosley. Britain's most dangerous fashion.

224
00:12:18.930 --> 00:12:19.763
<v 2>Awkward.</v>

225
00:12:20.280 --> 00:12:21.510
<v 0>And the summer of 1933,</v>

226
00:12:21.511 --> 00:12:25.440
Diana Mitford and a youngest sister unity traveled to Nuremberg to witness the

227
00:12:25.980 --> 00:12:27.300
Nazis victory rally by now,

228
00:12:27.301 --> 00:12:30.990
Diana was both Mosley's mistress and a hardcore fascist fan girl,

229
00:12:31.020 --> 00:12:34.530
but soon she and unity would be something else too. In Germany,

230
00:12:34.531 --> 00:12:36.960
they would become close friends, but that I've hit that back home.

231
00:12:37.230 --> 00:12:40.050
Dan as lover was already modeling himself on Germany's new leader,

232
00:12:40.080 --> 00:12:43.830
B U F rallies became Nazi tribute acts complete with lightning bolt flags.

233
00:12:43.860 --> 00:12:47.790
See how salutes and Mosley ranting on stage like a man possessed.

234
00:12:47.880 --> 00:12:51.180
At the same time, the party was deliberately targeting young, violent men,

235
00:12:51.360 --> 00:12:54.480
luring them in with sports events and Malcolm rotary,

236
00:12:54.481 --> 00:12:58.260
then preying on their grievances to radicalize them. Yes, at this stage,

237
00:12:58.380 --> 00:13:02.220
no one in the British establishment could see the danger people in 1934

238
00:13:02.221 --> 00:13:04.770
genuinely admired the B U F future King Edward.

239
00:13:04.771 --> 00:13:08.130
The aides wanted Mosley to be prime minister. The daily mail ran headlines,

240
00:13:08.131 --> 00:13:12.660
declaring hurrah for the black shirts membership at 50,000 people for a while,

241
00:13:12.750 --> 00:13:17.640
genuinely looks like Mosley's brands of British Nazi-ism might have mass appeal

242
00:13:17.910 --> 00:13:21.510
and then came the Olympia rally held on June the seventh,

243
00:13:21.511 --> 00:13:23.670
1934 at the Olympia arena.

244
00:13:23.820 --> 00:13:27.900
The rally was meant to be the biggest BOF meeting yet it's with Moseley holding

245
00:13:27.901 --> 00:13:29.970
court before 10,000 spectators,

246
00:13:30.090 --> 00:13:35.010
unfortunately planted among those spectators 500 anti-fascists who took turns,

247
00:13:35.011 --> 00:13:37.920
disrupting the meeting and said it was almost impossible to speak.

248
00:13:37.950 --> 00:13:39.870
The idea was to provoke a reaction,

249
00:13:39.900 --> 00:13:42.390
which they certainly got Mosley's black shirts,

250
00:13:42.391 --> 00:13:45.330
beat dozens of the protesters unconscious to the delight of that.

251
00:13:45.331 --> 00:13:47.010
You committed fascists in the crowd,

252
00:13:47.280 --> 00:13:49.140
but while the beatings played well in the arena,

253
00:13:49.230 --> 00:13:51.720
the general public was much more queasy.

254
00:13:52.050 --> 00:13:54.870
And the wake of the Olympia of islands newspapers withdrew their support for

255
00:13:55.320 --> 00:13:59.430
Mosley. The BBC banned him from their airwaves by 1935, this old timey,

256
00:13:59.431 --> 00:14:02.970
no platforming and seeing the bus shed 90% of its membership. Well,

257
00:14:03.090 --> 00:14:05.460
there remains the real hardcore fanatics.

258
00:14:05.550 --> 00:14:10.020
So Moseley began to ponder to them as hard as he could that year I did

259
00:14:10.021 --> 00:14:13.590
35, the B U F adopted a validly anti-sematic platform.

260
00:14:13.710 --> 00:14:18.090
We can't give you the worst examples of what mostly sad lest we trigger

261
00:14:18.720 --> 00:14:21.840
YouTube algorithms and see yet another real videos get demonetized,

262
00:14:21.841 --> 00:14:25.290
but Mosley openly called for the deportation of all Jews,

263
00:14:25.470 --> 00:14:28.530
declaring Britain for the British were still,

264
00:14:28.740 --> 00:14:32.820
he backed this hateful rhetoric with action on October the fourth, 1936,

265
00:14:32.910 --> 00:14:36.330
there were 3000 black shirts marched into the Jewish district of Stepney in East

266
00:14:36.360 --> 00:14:38.850
London. A show of force designed to intimidate,

267
00:14:39.030 --> 00:14:41.580
although a vast ground of ordinary people blocked that path.

268
00:14:41.730 --> 00:14:44.970
The March devolved into a rot that saw hundreds injured today.

269
00:14:44.971 --> 00:14:47.100
A bachelor of cable street is seen as a turning point.

270
00:14:47.250 --> 00:14:49.860
The moment Mosley lost the general public for good,

271
00:14:50.040 --> 00:14:53.660
but at the time it was a victory for fascism Mosley declared the government had

272
00:14:53.780 --> 00:14:56.150
surrendered to Jewish communist violence.

273
00:14:56.210 --> 00:14:58.940
The U S membership immediately spiked burst by then.

274
00:14:59.360 --> 00:15:03.350
Obviously he was already on his way to Berlin back in 1933, poor abused lady,

275
00:15:03.351 --> 00:15:04.131
Cynthia, uh,

276
00:15:04.131 --> 00:15:07.790
died leaving Mosley free to pursue his relationship with Adam Mitford.

277
00:15:07.850 --> 00:15:11.240
Now they were taking things to the next level on October the sixth, 1936,

278
00:15:11.241 --> 00:15:14.540
the two married in secret at the home of Joseph girls.

279
00:15:14.660 --> 00:15:17.780
The guest of honor was out off Hitler who presented the couple with a signed

280
00:15:17.781 --> 00:15:20.750
photograph as a wedding gift. Five days later,

281
00:15:20.780 --> 00:15:23.750
200 youths from the U S flooded into Marland in London,

282
00:15:23.751 --> 00:15:27.020
smashing Jewish shops and attacking anyone they thought to be Jewish.

283
00:15:27.110 --> 00:15:29.840
It was one of the worst incidents of antisemitic violence in modern British

284
00:15:29.841 --> 00:15:33.500
history, disgusting high points for most of these fascists.

285
00:15:33.620 --> 00:15:36.080
Luckily though his career would be all down.

286
00:15:43.150 --> 00:15:43.983
<v 3>The biggest.</v>

287
00:15:44.050 --> 00:15:48.010
<v 0>Against Mosley came just months after the battle of cable street that December</v>

288
00:15:48.011 --> 00:15:51.070
the national government decided it no longer gave a and bands,

289
00:15:51.080 --> 00:15:54.580
both the wearing of political uniforms and the right to hold political

290
00:15:55.330 --> 00:15:56.081
precessions at the same time,

291
00:15:56.081 --> 00:15:59.620
the owners of venues across the nation agreed to bomb Mosley and the bur from

292
00:15:59.621 --> 00:16:01.660
renting their properties. So they of course,

293
00:16:02.230 --> 00:16:05.500
Moseley could just reach out to his fascist fan boys on Twitter or parlor,

294
00:16:05.530 --> 00:16:07.320
but in the 1930s,

295
00:16:07.330 --> 00:16:10.660
loss of venues basically meant losing all of your publicity.

296
00:16:10.810 --> 00:16:14.590
And so Moseley vanished for a bit across 1937,

297
00:16:14.591 --> 00:16:16.960
he was so far out of public view that he might've well,

298
00:16:17.310 --> 00:16:20.530
I've just ceased to exist, but mostly it was nothing. If not determined.

299
00:16:20.590 --> 00:16:22.420
In 1938, he has on a brainwave,

300
00:16:22.660 --> 00:16:26.770
a way to resurrect the bus reputation among the genteel classes,

301
00:16:26.860 --> 00:16:30.340
the black shirts would become avowed pacifists. By now,

302
00:16:30.341 --> 00:16:34.120
it was obvious to everybody in Britain. This another major war was coming.

303
00:16:34.121 --> 00:16:37.930
One very few people wanted to be a part of it was an arrow and the Chamberlin

304
00:16:37.931 --> 00:16:39.460
government was pursuing appeasement.

305
00:16:39.580 --> 00:16:43.450
When the prime minister could dismiss the Nazi invasion of Czechoslovakia is a

306
00:16:43.990 --> 00:16:48.520
coral in a faraway country between people of whom we know nothing in such

307
00:16:48.521 --> 00:16:49.271
circumstances.

308
00:16:49.271 --> 00:16:53.230
It's perhaps no surprise that Moseley saw his popularity rebounds over the next

309
00:16:53.231 --> 00:16:54.064
18 months,

310
00:16:54.220 --> 00:16:57.880
Mosley cultivated a dove like image with the British public mass rallies were

311
00:16:57.881 --> 00:17:00.910
held where he implored people to stay out of any future war.

312
00:17:00.970 --> 00:17:03.970
These rallies were a moderate success by mid 1939.

313
00:17:03.971 --> 00:17:07.420
There were even whispers that Moseley might be in the process of a political

314
00:17:07.421 --> 00:17:11.170
comeback, but then the war arrived and the bus popularity,

315
00:17:11.350 --> 00:17:12.520
again collapsed.

316
00:17:12.670 --> 00:17:16.060
Although Mosley told his followers not to work as agents for Germany,

317
00:17:16.480 --> 00:17:19.240
nobody believed he meant it. Indeed. As former deputy leader,

318
00:17:19.241 --> 00:17:23.320
William Joyce had already fled to Berlin and began making Nazi propaganda runs

319
00:17:23.410 --> 00:17:24.370
and the nickname, Lord,

320
00:17:25.120 --> 00:17:28.210
there was no way the government was going to leave Mosley and his potential

321
00:17:28.240 --> 00:17:33.190
fifth column running around free during wartime on may the 23rd, 1940,

322
00:17:33.191 --> 00:17:35.170
just after Churchill became prime minister.

323
00:17:35.410 --> 00:17:39.490
The U was banned and 800 of its members were arrested as security risks.

324
00:17:39.970 --> 00:17:43.570
Mosley was imprisoned two months later, Dan and Mitford was also arrested.

325
00:17:43.750 --> 00:17:48.280
The couple of signed photograph of Hitler was found in the baby's Crip that same

326
00:17:48.281 --> 00:17:50.760
year they were interned together at Holloway prison.

327
00:17:51.120 --> 00:17:52.980
And that was it for Tom Mosley's public career.

328
00:17:53.220 --> 00:17:56.670
Although the pair were released on compassionate grounds in November, 1943,

329
00:17:56.850 --> 00:18:00.480
it was to a general public that now considered them about as trustworthy as the

330
00:18:00.481 --> 00:18:03.210
love child of Judas and Benedict Arnold.

331
00:18:03.270 --> 00:18:06.720
The two stayed under house arrest until the Wars ended in 1945.

332
00:18:06.990 --> 00:18:10.740
The moment they could, they abandoned ruins after an unhappy stopping islands.

333
00:18:10.741 --> 00:18:15.150
The couple eventually wound up setting up a fancy house outside Paris from

334
00:18:15.900 --> 00:18:17.580
Mosley, incessantly, plotted a comeback.

335
00:18:17.700 --> 00:18:21.570
He reinvented himself as a passionate European calling for a United Europe to

336
00:18:21.870 --> 00:18:23.520
ends the incessant cycles of bloodshed.

337
00:18:23.930 --> 00:18:26.850
But while his pro Europe speeches were full of appeals to peace,

338
00:18:26.940 --> 00:18:30.660
you only have to scratch the surface to see the poisons still lurking in his

339
00:18:30.661 --> 00:18:33.240
veins. Mosley's declaration of Venice, for example,

340
00:18:33.241 --> 00:18:37.170
suggested forcibly dividing Sub-Saharan Africa into black and white nations,

341
00:18:37.171 --> 00:18:41.250
and then essentially using the black nation as both cheap labor and to captive

342
00:18:41.251 --> 00:18:43.560
market for European products. At the same time,

343
00:18:43.590 --> 00:18:46.980
mostly continued to rabble Rouse on hot button issues on one occasion,

344
00:18:47.010 --> 00:18:47.791
while back in London,

345
00:18:47.791 --> 00:18:51.900
he demanded the immediate deportation of all nonwhites from Britain and a ban on

346
00:18:51.901 --> 00:18:54.780
interracial marriages. As a son, Nicholas wrote afterwards,

347
00:18:54.870 --> 00:18:58.830
I see clearly that while all the right-hand delts with grandiose ideas and

348
00:18:58.831 --> 00:19:02.430
glory, the left hands, that's the rat out of the sewer still,

349
00:19:02.640 --> 00:19:07.230
and no longer really mattered what Tom Mosley sent in 1959. And again, in 1966,

350
00:19:07.231 --> 00:19:09.990
the former political superstar stood for election as an NP,

351
00:19:10.020 --> 00:19:14.520
both times he got so few votes that calling him and irrelevance would overstate

352
00:19:14.521 --> 00:19:18.870
his importance after his 1966 failure Mosley officially retired from better

353
00:19:18.880 --> 00:19:19.560
school life.

354
00:19:19.560 --> 00:19:23.220
Although he edited a far-right magazine and captain sandwich with a vast number

355
00:19:23.221 --> 00:19:24.300
of important figures,

356
00:19:24.620 --> 00:19:28.640
well was that was essentially it for his influence on public life. Well,

357
00:19:28.760 --> 00:19:32.210
at least until he turned up as the bad guy and Peaky blinders,

358
00:19:32.990 --> 00:19:35.810
Leslie died on December the third, 1980 at his home in France,

359
00:19:35.870 --> 00:19:38.990
cremated his ashes wearing ties and Paris is piano,

360
00:19:39.260 --> 00:19:41.960
Shay cemetery far away from the islands nation.

361
00:19:41.990 --> 00:19:44.810
He had once imagined he could lead for part time.

362
00:19:44.811 --> 00:19:47.600
Mitford lived on in 2003 and all that time.

363
00:19:47.840 --> 00:19:51.740
She never wants to express regrets for befriending Hitler or sporting Germany in

364
00:19:51.741 --> 00:19:52.574
world war II.

365
00:19:52.730 --> 00:19:56.450
Today also almost there's a little more than an interesting what FFA historical

366
00:19:56.451 --> 00:20:00.470
footnotes off, and you can hang all sorts of alternate history ideas.

367
00:20:00.620 --> 00:20:02.810
For example, maybe he really could have been a prime minister.

368
00:20:02.960 --> 00:20:05.300
Maybe the new party could have really fulfilled its potential,

369
00:20:05.330 --> 00:20:09.020
or maybe he could have stayed within the labor party and somehow deposed and

370
00:20:09.021 --> 00:20:11.300
replaced Ramsey MacDonald equally.

371
00:20:11.301 --> 00:20:14.330
It's easy to imagine a version of history where the Nazis succeeded in

372
00:20:14.331 --> 00:20:15.164
conquering Britain,

373
00:20:15.320 --> 00:20:20.000
a version of history where Hitler anointed Mosley as leader of a fascist UK

374
00:20:20.360 --> 00:20:22.670
boil. It's easy to imagine a version of Oswell Mosley's life,

375
00:20:22.671 --> 00:20:26.810
where he amounted to something that wasn't the life he led instead the historic

376
00:20:26.811 --> 00:20:31.040
mostly, yeah, always remain a man who gambles big and lost everything, man,

377
00:20:31.041 --> 00:20:34.100
who started out sympathetic, but eventually drifted away yeah.

378
00:20:34.130 --> 00:20:38.660
Into a fog of conspiracy theories and antisemitism that put in beyond the pale

379
00:20:38.810 --> 00:20:42.140
of all, but the craziest of British Nazis in the ends,

380
00:20:42.350 --> 00:20:44.180
perhaps that's a fitting appetite for a man.

381
00:20:44.181 --> 00:20:47.770
So full of self-importance to be remembered, not with, or not with fear,

382
00:20:48.190 --> 00:20:52.180
but with mold, curiosity, and interesting failure at best,

383
00:20:52.450 --> 00:20:54.820
it's comforting to know that we're mostly alive today.

384
00:20:55.090 --> 00:20:59.140
This reputation is probably exactly what he wouldn't have wanted.

385
00:20:59.710 --> 00:21:01.750
