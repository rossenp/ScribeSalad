00:00:17.960 --> 00:00:19.130
<v 0>On September the 16th,</v>

6
00:00:19.160 --> 00:00:23.960
2015 CNN hosted a Republican debate as part of the lead up to the

7
00:00:23.961 --> 00:00:26.690
2016 us presidential election.

8
00:00:26.720 --> 00:00:29.900
Despite the fact that he had been dead for more than 10 years,

9
00:00:30.080 --> 00:00:34.670
Ronald Reagan was mentioned during this event, 63 times,

10
00:00:34.700 --> 00:00:39.650
the candidates themselves stood behind podiums in the shadow of Ronald Reagan's.

11
00:00:39.980 --> 00:00:44.120
One time presidential plane found September stage was a powerful metaphor.

12
00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:46.880
Anyone who pays attention to American politics,

13
00:00:47.060 --> 00:00:50.300
couldn't tell you that the legacy of Ronald Reagan casts a long shadow,

14
00:00:50.390 --> 00:00:51.620
the Reagan presidency,

15
00:00:51.710 --> 00:00:56.690
forced and indelible image of modern conservatism that will likely India

16
00:00:56.720 --> 00:00:59.060
well into the 21st century.

17
00:00:59.090 --> 00:01:03.890
But the story of Ronald Reagan is much more than some straight line from

18
00:01:04.070 --> 00:01:06.800
Nobel birth to Republican iconography.

19
00:01:06.890 --> 00:01:11.420
It's a labyrinth path of career decisions that moves Reagan through Hollywood,

20
00:01:11.690 --> 00:01:14.990
the American Midwest, and eventually the white house,

21
00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:18.830
even as political positions were non-linear he's often thought of as a

22
00:01:18.831 --> 00:01:23.300
quintessential conservative, but the truth is Reagan was rarely predictable.

23
00:01:23.570 --> 00:01:25.310
He rallied against big governments,

24
00:01:25.311 --> 00:01:29.840
but he also loved the new deal campaigned against Richard Nixon and oversaw the

25
00:01:29.870 --> 00:01:33.020
largest goober national tax increase in American history.

26
00:01:33.080 --> 00:01:36.440
The 40th president spent a lifetime accumulating nicknames.

27
00:01:36.470 --> 00:01:39.320
You can call them raw, hide the Gipper, the great communicator,

28
00:01:39.321 --> 00:01:43.550
or even the jelly bean man. But on today's episode of biographics,

29
00:01:43.970 --> 00:01:45.380
we'll just call him Ronald Reagan.

32
00:01:53.631 --> 00:01:57.260
Ronald Wilson Reagan was not born into wealth or power.

33
00:01:57.470 --> 00:02:01.880
He was born on February the fifth, 1911 in a small apartment in Tampico,

34
00:02:01.881 --> 00:02:02.570
Illinois,

35
00:02:02.570 --> 00:02:06.950
his mother Nell Clyde Wilson was a Scot and a devout Protestant.

36
00:02:07.070 --> 00:02:11.240
His father Jack was an Irish alcoholic who worked as a traveling salesman during

37
00:02:11.241 --> 00:02:14.420
Ron's teenage years. Ronald's also had an older brother,

38
00:02:14.480 --> 00:02:17.720
Neil who was two and a half years. His elder as a young child,

39
00:02:17.721 --> 00:02:21.320
the Reagans moved around a lot with Jack and such a steady work.

40
00:02:21.380 --> 00:02:23.000
The family had stints in Chicago,

41
00:02:23.030 --> 00:02:26.270
Galesburg and Monmouth before returning to Tampico.

42
00:02:26.271 --> 00:02:28.100
After Ronald's eighth birthday,

43
00:02:28.190 --> 00:02:33.170
they lived above the HC Pitney variety store with Jack working downstairs

44
00:02:33.171 --> 00:02:37.010
in the store itself were all his family eventually settled in Dixon.

45
00:02:37.490 --> 00:02:40.370
He developed a reputation as a bit of a variety man himself.

46
00:02:40.430 --> 00:02:43.190
Ronald was naturally athletic and enjoyed playing football,

47
00:02:43.191 --> 00:02:46.460
but he also enjoyed time on the stage in the 1920s,

48
00:02:46.461 --> 00:02:50.180
excelling at sports and theater just meant you were a well-rounded young adults

49
00:02:50.210 --> 00:02:50.781
nowadays,

50
00:02:50.781 --> 00:02:54.860
such a combination is unlikely enough to prompt Disney movies that involve

51
00:02:54.861 --> 00:02:56.420
singing and dancing.

52
00:02:56.600 --> 00:03:01.300
Regardless young Reagan was known as a multitalented youth, even at a young age,

53
00:03:01.330 --> 00:03:04.690
he was a naturally gifted communicator who enjoyed telling stories.

54
00:03:05.050 --> 00:03:08.980
He also worked as a lifeguard on the rock river in LA Parkway.

55
00:03:09.250 --> 00:03:12.400
He made more than 70 water rescues at Eureka college.

56
00:03:12.401 --> 00:03:15.940
He continued his stage acting while also serving as captain of the swim team and

57
00:03:15.941 --> 00:03:16.540
the football team.

58
00:03:16.540 --> 00:03:20.350
He took an interest in campus politics to where his intelligence and gift of

59
00:03:20.351 --> 00:03:23.560
gab. And in the position of student council presidents,

60
00:03:23.710 --> 00:03:28.630
he graduated with a double major in sociology and economics after completing his

61
00:03:28.631 --> 00:03:31.150
formal education. Reagan had to do that.

62
00:03:31.151 --> 00:03:35.580
One thing that every Jack of all trades must eventually do

63
00:03:35.880 --> 00:03:40.350
narrow his interests down to just one Korea. He shows sports,

64
00:03:40.470 --> 00:03:44.370
taking a job as a radio announcer in Iowa in 1932. At first,

65
00:03:44.371 --> 00:03:45.780
you worked for several stations,

66
00:03:45.781 --> 00:03:49.830
but he eventually narrowed his focus to who radio in Des Moines,

67
00:03:49.950 --> 00:03:53.160
offering play-by-play for Cubs games, especially reality.

68
00:03:53.240 --> 00:03:56.760
It became maintaining a consistent play by play narrative over the radio.

69
00:03:56.910 --> 00:04:00.930
Despite the fact that he was receiving any basic information about the game via

70
00:04:00.931 --> 00:04:01.764
Telegraph,

71
00:04:01.830 --> 00:04:06.000
why Reagan stayed in sports throughout much of the 1930s offering routine

72
00:04:06.030 --> 00:04:09.480
comfort to Midwestern baseball fans throughout the great depression.

73
00:04:09.750 --> 00:04:11.070
But in 1937,

74
00:04:11.100 --> 00:04:15.360
he was traveling in California with the Cubs during the West coast swing and was

75
00:04:15.361 --> 00:04:18.750
offered the chance to do a screen test. Reagan's still an ILT.

76
00:04:19.050 --> 00:04:22.740
Tyler's had men took the offer and it led to a seven year contract with Warner

77
00:04:22.741 --> 00:04:26.790
brothers. He appeared as the leading man in love is on the air. Later that year,

78
00:04:26.880 --> 00:04:30.900
his career in sports was quickly vaporized by the potential of the silver

79
00:04:30.901 --> 00:04:34.770
screen. Over the next two years, Reagan appears in nearly two dozen films,

80
00:04:34.771 --> 00:04:38.670
including dark victory with Humphrey Bogart and Betty Davis.

81
00:04:38.760 --> 00:04:43.710
He also made a dramedy called brother rats with Jane Wyman in 1938 about cadets

82
00:04:43.711 --> 00:04:46.650
at the prestigious Virginia military Institute. Two years later,

83
00:04:47.010 --> 00:04:50.970
Reagan and Wyman made a SQL called brother rat and the baby and the pair also

84
00:04:50.971 --> 00:04:52.620
got married in 1940.

85
00:04:52.621 --> 00:04:57.420
He returned to his love of sports to play George Gipp and a news rock biopic,

86
00:04:57.450 --> 00:05:00.960
which gave him one of his more famous nicknames. The gypper an exhibition,

87
00:05:01.200 --> 00:05:04.770
Paul anointed in the fifth, most popular young star of Hollywood in 1941.

88
00:05:04.830 --> 00:05:08.370
The following year in 1942, Reagan received not his biggest role,

89
00:05:08.371 --> 00:05:11.230
but perhaps his most important two years prior,

90
00:05:11.280 --> 00:05:14.850
also Henry bellman had written a book called Kings row that focused on the

91
00:05:14.851 --> 00:05:18.750
hypocrisy and his mythology life in the American Midwest.

92
00:05:18.930 --> 00:05:20.190
And it became a best seller.

93
00:05:20.250 --> 00:05:24.720
The book was adapted as a movie by Casey Robinson in 1942 with

94
00:05:24.870 --> 00:05:29.310
Reagan playing the role of Drake here, Reagan's character, isn't the lead,

95
00:05:29.490 --> 00:05:33.360
but he does I of a key scene where he wakes up from a medical operation and a

96
00:05:33.361 --> 00:05:38.250
rogue surgeon has amputated both of his legs. Reagan forensically explains.

97
00:05:38.910 --> 00:05:43.050
Whereas the rest of me and audiences eight at top Kings row is often considered

98
00:05:43.051 --> 00:05:46.650
the highlight of Reagan's movie career Warner brothers tripled his salary to

99
00:05:46.651 --> 00:05:51.570
$3,000 a week. You can do stairs on the precipice of true Hollywood fame.

100
00:05:51.780 --> 00:05:54.930
Unfortunately Reagan's career was bound to be pushed in a completely different

101
00:05:54.931 --> 00:05:59.330
direction instead of being called up to brothers studio for his next great table

102
00:05:59.331 --> 00:06:00.110
read,

103
00:06:00.110 --> 00:06:04.550
it was called to active duty military service on the 18th of April, 1942.

104
00:06:10.540 --> 00:06:10.690
<v 1>[Inaudible].</v>

105
00:06:10.690 --> 00:06:13.480
<v 0>Back in 1937, when he was still covering the cobs,</v>

106
00:06:13.481 --> 00:06:15.880
Ronald Reagan had enlisted in the army reserves.

107
00:06:16.210 --> 00:06:19.510
He was commissioned as a second Lieutenant in the officer's reserve Corps of the

108
00:06:19.511 --> 00:06:24.220
cavalry, but was also classified as a limited service due to his poor eyesight.

109
00:06:24.430 --> 00:06:26.830
When Reagan was called up to active duty, as I say,

110
00:06:26.920 --> 00:06:29.740
it kept him stateside and off the true battlefields.

111
00:06:29.770 --> 00:06:33.730
He was given a port liaison post in San Francisco almost immediately.

112
00:06:34.120 --> 00:06:37.930
Reagan applied for a transfer from the cavalry unit to the army air force,

113
00:06:37.960 --> 00:06:40.510
which he stayed in for the remainder of the war. Reagan.

114
00:06:40.511 --> 00:06:44.800
The thespian was heavily utilized by motion picture units first in California,

115
00:06:44.801 --> 00:06:48.910
and later in New York to create useful videos for the armed forces he was

116
00:06:48.911 --> 00:06:53.410
involved in project seemed a training recruiting and even fundraising by the end

117
00:06:53.411 --> 00:06:57.070
of the war, his units produced more than 400 videos for the air force,

118
00:06:57.071 --> 00:07:00.850
including cockpit simulations for bombing runs of the Japanese mainlands.

119
00:07:01.300 --> 00:07:04.870
He'd have to activity usually on December the ninth, 1945, having a teams,

120
00:07:04.871 --> 00:07:06.640
the rank of captain after the war,

121
00:07:06.670 --> 00:07:09.700
Reagan returns a Hollywood acting in a number of B-list war,

122
00:07:09.701 --> 00:07:14.410
films and leaning ever so slightly into his dormant love for politics.

123
00:07:14.530 --> 00:07:18.550
It became the third vice president of the screen actors Guild in 1946 while he

124
00:07:18.551 --> 00:07:22.630
was making movies like stallion road and the voice of the turtle in 1947,

125
00:07:22.690 --> 00:07:26.260
much of the Guild was forced to resign over a conflict of interest.

126
00:07:26.261 --> 00:07:29.830
And Reagan was elected president of the Guild in a special election.

127
00:07:30.220 --> 00:07:32.200
He was reelected six times,

128
00:07:32.320 --> 00:07:35.800
including every year from 1947 to 1951,

129
00:07:36.100 --> 00:07:39.160
Reagan led the screen actors Guild through a tumultuous time,

130
00:07:39.190 --> 00:07:43.150
but his tenure is generally considered a huge success for Hollywood.

131
00:07:43.420 --> 00:07:46.810
He helped secure residual pay for actors when their movies or television

132
00:07:46.811 --> 00:07:51.190
episodes were rerun. He also oversaw a handful of labor management disputes.

133
00:07:51.460 --> 00:07:55.660
This period of time was the beginning of the Hollywood blacklist era.

134
00:07:55.661 --> 00:07:59.230
When motion picture company has kept a growing list of actors and actresses,

135
00:07:59.260 --> 00:08:01.720
they considered to be communist sympathizers.

136
00:08:02.020 --> 00:08:04.270
And with whom they would refuse to work,

137
00:08:04.360 --> 00:08:08.110
Reagan was constantly asked how by identifying communists or to help clear the

138
00:08:08.111 --> 00:08:10.990
name of someone who had been wrongly accused. For example,

139
00:08:10.991 --> 00:08:14.530
there's a well-documented case of a young actress who barely had a foot in the

140
00:08:14.531 --> 00:08:19.360
door in 1947, seeking help from Guild president Reagan's who play a good name,

141
00:08:19.450 --> 00:08:20.710
both Reagan and his wife,

142
00:08:20.711 --> 00:08:25.060
Jane Wyman cooperated with a number of FBI investigations regarding which

143
00:08:25.061 --> 00:08:29.920
Hollywood personalities might be hiding or even not hiding communist sympathies.

144
00:08:30.280 --> 00:08:34.180
He was given the code name T 10 and provided information to the U S government

145
00:08:34.181 --> 00:08:35.980
on several occasions. Regular thought.

146
00:08:36.010 --> 00:08:39.490
This was a good idea to a point like many Americans at the time,

147
00:08:39.491 --> 00:08:43.210
he believed that communism and its beliefs were antithetical to American

148
00:08:43.211 --> 00:08:44.470
democracy. However,

149
00:08:44.471 --> 00:08:48.010
Reagan also showed some level of disbelief that the extent of the finger

150
00:08:48.430 --> 00:08:50.890
pointing that the FBI was asking him to do at one point,

151
00:08:50.920 --> 00:08:53.920
Reagan allegedly mouthed off to his FBI handlers asking,

152
00:08:54.190 --> 00:08:58.590
do you expect to constitute ourselves as a little FBI of our own and

153
00:08:58.770 --> 00:09:03.030
determine who is a colony and who isn't as the 1940s were coming to a close,

154
00:09:03.031 --> 00:09:05.880
Ronald Reagan could feel his ambitions evolving again.

155
00:09:06.120 --> 00:09:10.590
He was still acting in films and even began to consider adopting some television

156
00:09:10.591 --> 00:09:14.880
roles, but the career he was envisioning wasn't quite so film focused.

157
00:09:15.000 --> 00:09:18.630
His experience with the screen actors Guild had given him a taste for what a

158
00:09:18.631 --> 00:09:20.640
real political career might feel like.

159
00:09:20.670 --> 00:09:24.750
And he started giving serious thought to statewide political involvements in

160
00:09:24.751 --> 00:09:26.310
California, Reagan's wife.

161
00:09:26.311 --> 00:09:30.480
Jane was not nearly as enthusiastic about this potential career change.

162
00:09:30.540 --> 00:09:34.290
Bottled his involvement with a professional Guild was one thing that she did not

163
00:09:34.291 --> 00:09:36.510
want to be a politician's wife.

164
00:09:36.600 --> 00:09:41.010
His new aspirations became a major marital conflict in the late 1940s.

165
00:09:41.370 --> 00:09:45.060
There was another much more somber source of tension between the Reagans like

166
00:09:45.330 --> 00:09:48.900
Jane had given birth to their first child, Maureen in 1941.

167
00:09:48.901 --> 00:09:52.200
And the couple that adopted a son, Michael in 1945,

168
00:09:52.380 --> 00:09:54.510
Jane was pregnant again in 1947,

169
00:09:54.511 --> 00:09:59.100
but her second biological child was born four months early and died after one

170
00:09:59.101 --> 00:10:00.570
day by 1948,

171
00:10:00.571 --> 00:10:03.810
Jane Wyman had filed for divorce citing her husband's growing political

172
00:10:03.811 --> 00:10:07.710
ambition, as well as his present day distractions with the screen actors Guild,

173
00:10:07.920 --> 00:10:10.410
as the reasons for her dissatisfaction,

174
00:10:10.650 --> 00:10:13.530
there were also explicit ideological differences.

175
00:10:14.100 --> 00:10:17.460
Wyman was a Republican married to a democratic political activist.

176
00:10:17.760 --> 00:10:20.970
That separation was finalized in 1949.

177
00:10:21.120 --> 00:10:23.340
Reagan began campaigning for democratic candidate,

178
00:10:23.341 --> 00:10:27.510
Harry Truman during his reelection campaign in 1948 for American history of

179
00:10:27.780 --> 00:10:27.781
offs.

180
00:10:27.781 --> 00:10:32.280
This was the infamous Dewey defeats Truman campaign where Truman had to win his

181
00:10:32.310 --> 00:10:35.730
own election. After assuming the presidency following Franklin Roosevelt,

182
00:10:35.731 --> 00:10:40.230
his death Jack Reagan had been a staunch populous Democrats imparting to his

183
00:10:40.231 --> 00:10:43.860
son. The wisdom of trust, busting child, labor laws,

184
00:10:44.100 --> 00:10:46.560
and minimum wage and progressive tax plans.

185
00:10:46.740 --> 00:10:50.620
FDR had been an inspiration to Reagan throughout his entire adult.

186
00:10:50.760 --> 00:10:53.850
It Truman was the obvious choice for Reagan.

187
00:10:53.940 --> 00:10:58.500
He appeared on stage with Truman during an Los Angeles rally dispose of Rooney

188
00:10:58.620 --> 00:11:01.590
as reporting from the Chicago daily Tribune. Reagan's man,

189
00:11:02.010 --> 00:11:03.900
one big defeating Republican favorites,

190
00:11:03.960 --> 00:11:08.370
Thomas Dewey with 303 electoral votes to 189.

191
00:11:08.490 --> 00:11:10.290
Even while he continued to record films,

192
00:11:10.650 --> 00:11:13.860
Reagan joins in on a number of democratic fights in the early 1950s.

193
00:11:14.130 --> 00:11:16.320
He opposed Republican right to work legislation.

194
00:11:16.350 --> 00:11:20.490
He also helped Helen Douglas in her Senate campaign against a California man by

195
00:11:20.491 --> 00:11:22.710
the name of Richard Nixon, between his filmography,

196
00:11:22.800 --> 00:11:25.770
his guilt presidency and his growing political portfolio.

197
00:11:26.010 --> 00:11:29.670
Ronald Reagan had become the most powerful Democrat in Hollywood.

198
00:11:30.000 --> 00:11:31.820
And just before we get into the rest, sure. Today's video.

199
00:11:31.821 --> 00:11:35.270
I do want to tell you about today's sponsor Ray con.

200
00:11:35.720 --> 00:11:39.290
Rayco made great earbuds with a great sound. There's an affordable price point.

201
00:11:39.320 --> 00:11:41.630
They're all about innovative design, uh,

202
00:11:41.631 --> 00:11:45.290
prices that just don't break the bank.

203
00:11:45.350 --> 00:11:49.520
They sent me a pair of these the every day eat 25 earbuds.

204
00:11:49.910 --> 00:11:52.160
And we'll just pop that in. And I've been using them for a couple of days.

205
00:11:52.161 --> 00:11:53.650
They fit easily. The air,

206
00:11:54.160 --> 00:11:58.150
the Bluetooth connects amazingly easily because now I'm listening to a YouTube

207
00:11:58.180 --> 00:12:02.200
video. I was watching on my phone. Um, so I'm gonna take that out, but, uh,

208
00:12:02.201 --> 00:12:05.440
it's pretty great how easily they do just connect just like that.

209
00:12:05.560 --> 00:12:07.930
Plus they come with this case, which gives four charges.

210
00:12:07.960 --> 00:12:11.980
So you get six hours in the air buds recharge it four more times in this case

211
00:12:11.981 --> 00:12:14.350
now I've used cheaper buds have used expensive air buds,

212
00:12:14.351 --> 00:12:18.580
but what Ray cones do is they deliver a premium experience at about half the

213
00:12:18.581 --> 00:12:20.890
price of other premium wireless earbuds.

214
00:12:20.920 --> 00:12:24.970
So if you just go to Biray con.com forward slash

215
00:12:25.000 --> 00:12:29.860
biographics, you'll get 15% off your order and let's get back to today's video.

216
00:12:35.850 --> 00:12:36.630
<v 1>[Inaudible].</v>

217
00:12:36.630 --> 00:12:39.930
<v 0>Reagan's priorities began to change pretty dramatically again in the 1950s,</v>

218
00:12:39.931 --> 00:12:43.680
but this time it wasn't his career aspirations that were evolving.

219
00:12:43.920 --> 00:12:46.350
It was his idea and logical ones. For one thing,

220
00:12:46.380 --> 00:12:49.320
Reagan began to feel comfortable with the idea of remarrying.

221
00:12:49.380 --> 00:12:52.830
Reagan was emotionally wrecked after his divorce from Jane Wyman,

222
00:12:53.040 --> 00:12:56.910
perhaps in part, because he felt like her complaints about him were true.

223
00:12:57.150 --> 00:13:00.180
He had been consumed by his work with a screen actors Guild.

224
00:13:00.210 --> 00:13:03.690
Since his divorce Reagan had met a woman and he felt a deep connection with,

225
00:13:03.691 --> 00:13:07.620
but he wasn't prepared to retire the not just yet as for the women that are

226
00:13:07.890 --> 00:13:12.180
court Reagan's attention or remember fearful Guild member who had comes a Reagan

227
00:13:12.181 --> 00:13:15.930
for help when the FBI was looking to make her as communist. Well,

228
00:13:15.931 --> 00:13:18.390
her name was Nancy Davis, a lesson,

229
00:13:18.391 --> 00:13:22.620
no New York city transplants and small time Hollywood actress after Reagan's

230
00:13:22.621 --> 00:13:27.210
divorce. He finally gave in and remarried on the 4th of March, 1952,

231
00:13:27.360 --> 00:13:30.300
realizing that she was the true love of his life.

232
00:13:30.450 --> 00:13:33.240
Nancy Davis retains her stage name for movie credits,

233
00:13:33.241 --> 00:13:37.470
but legally she changed her name to Nancy Reagan, the couple of two children,

234
00:13:37.500 --> 00:13:38.670
Patricia and Reagan,

235
00:13:38.671 --> 00:13:42.780
who was born in October of 1952 and Robert Prescott Reagan,

236
00:13:42.781 --> 00:13:44.250
who was born in 1958.

237
00:13:44.310 --> 00:13:49.170
The far bigger diametric shift in Reagan's life was political in 1954

238
00:13:49.171 --> 00:13:52.320
with middle-age setting in and his movie career dying down.

239
00:13:52.410 --> 00:13:55.400
Reagan took a job as the host of general electric theater,

240
00:13:55.410 --> 00:14:00.270
a CBS anthology series that featured television adaptations of popular novels,

241
00:14:00.300 --> 00:14:03.540
short stories, movies, or plays Reagan earns

242
00:14:05.160 --> 00:14:08.100
$125,000 a year along with an even wider level of fame.

243
00:14:08.130 --> 00:14:11.880
The show topped out at number three in the Nielsen ratings in 1957,

244
00:14:11.970 --> 00:14:14.370
as part of his contractual duties as show host,

245
00:14:14.371 --> 00:14:17.850
Reagan was required to draw dozens of general electric plants all across the

246
00:14:17.851 --> 00:14:19.800
country and talk with the workers.

247
00:14:19.830 --> 00:14:23.400
Reagan could speak as many as 14 or 15 times a day,

248
00:14:23.610 --> 00:14:27.890
once a GE public relations liaison that worked alongside Reagan remarks,

249
00:14:27.910 --> 00:14:31.500
the general electric saturated him in middle America.

250
00:14:31.710 --> 00:14:35.850
As burdensome as the tools likely were for a national star like Reagan.

251
00:14:36.090 --> 00:14:39.540
They were also good practice. Reagan was always a gifted speaker,

252
00:14:39.570 --> 00:14:43.860
but his 10,000 hours of speaking to average Americans polished as a rater re

253
00:14:43.861 --> 00:14:46.170
skills to elite levels,

254
00:14:46.350 --> 00:14:51.060
it would eventually be nicknamed the Greek communicator exposure to hundreds.

255
00:14:51.140 --> 00:14:55.520
Factory work has also shifted his political ideology. Reagan still admired.

256
00:14:55.521 --> 00:14:57.020
FDR still believed.

257
00:14:57.140 --> 00:15:01.520
And many of the populist principles that have been passed down by his father,

258
00:15:01.610 --> 00:15:06.140
but his time spent in factories and around factory workers began to

259
00:15:06.890 --> 00:15:10.910
refocus his attention on the benefits of business and the potential dangers of

260
00:15:10.970 --> 00:15:12.470
unchecked government growth.

261
00:15:12.560 --> 00:15:17.030
His metamorphosis continued into the 1960s when he was ready to formally change

262
00:15:17.060 --> 00:15:19.490
parties and jump headlong into politics.

263
00:15:19.520 --> 00:15:23.480
GE forbade Reagan from getting too politically involved while the host of a

264
00:15:23.481 --> 00:15:27.800
popular television program theory would inevitably alienate viewers Reagan

265
00:15:27.830 --> 00:15:29.360
didn't disagree with that premise.

266
00:15:29.480 --> 00:15:33.710
So he left the show in 1962 and registered as a Republican.

267
00:15:33.950 --> 00:15:35.750
I didn't leave the democratic party.

268
00:15:36.020 --> 00:15:39.890
Reagan famously said the party left me Reagan.

269
00:15:39.891 --> 00:15:43.130
The Republican jumped into the deep end of the pool very quickly.

270
00:15:43.310 --> 00:15:47.360
He opposed Medicare legislation fairing that such a broad entitlement program

271
00:15:47.361 --> 00:15:51.320
was the first major domino to fall on the way to a socialist America.

272
00:15:51.560 --> 00:15:53.510
He also opposed the food stamp program,

273
00:15:53.511 --> 00:15:57.800
which was introduced around the same time and proposed a raised the minimum wage

274
00:15:57.860 --> 00:16:01.580
Reagan's policy positions were principled, but unsexy,

275
00:16:01.700 --> 00:16:05.690
he made a far bigger splash when he gave a high profile speech advocating for

276
00:16:05.900 --> 00:16:09.380
presidential candidate Barry Goldwater in the run-up to the presidential

277
00:16:09.381 --> 00:16:10.880
election of 1964.

278
00:16:10.940 --> 00:16:15.650
His speech a time for choosing is a 27 minute master class in political speech,

279
00:16:15.651 --> 00:16:18.830
making Reagan smoothly, weaves together, anecdotes, jokes,

280
00:16:18.831 --> 00:16:23.180
and admonishments against big governments, whatever your political ideology.

281
00:16:23.210 --> 00:16:27.860
It's tough to watch the speech and not come away impressed by Reagan's Polish

282
00:16:28.160 --> 00:16:28.993
as neurotic.

283
00:16:29.050 --> 00:16:31.690
<v 2>If we lose freedom here, there's no place to escape to.</v>

284
00:16:31.691 --> 00:16:33.070
This is the last stand on it.

285
00:16:33.340 --> 00:16:34.390
<v 0>Reagan's candidate.</v>

286
00:16:34.450 --> 00:16:39.310
Barry Goldwater was trounced by Lyndon Johnson losing the electoral

287
00:16:39.311 --> 00:16:42.670
college 486 to 52,

288
00:16:42.820 --> 00:16:46.570
but Reagan himself got a massive popularity bump from his national speaking

289
00:16:46.571 --> 00:16:47.170
engagement.

290
00:16:47.170 --> 00:16:50.980
One writer from the Washington post called it the most successful national

291
00:16:50.981 --> 00:16:55.360
political debut. Since William Jennings Bryan in 1964,

292
00:16:55.540 --> 00:16:58.930
it was completely unprecedented to jump from life as a TV star,

293
00:16:58.931 --> 00:17:00.490
straight into the political arena,

294
00:17:00.520 --> 00:17:04.840
but that's exactly what Reagan had the cache to do. So in 1965,

295
00:17:04.841 --> 00:17:07.630
he announced that he would run for governor of California.

296
00:17:07.840 --> 00:17:10.180
Reagan was campaigning to replace Pat Brown,

297
00:17:10.181 --> 00:17:14.620
a two-term incumbent who had most recently defeated Richard Dickson in 1962

298
00:17:14.710 --> 00:17:18.940
Nixon. Wasn't a true carpetbagger as he was indeed from California,

299
00:17:18.970 --> 00:17:23.080
but he was running on the heels of eight years as Dwight Eisenhower's vice

300
00:17:23.730 --> 00:17:26.290
presidents. And he had little grasp of the state issues.

301
00:17:26.470 --> 00:17:30.850
Reagan proved to be a much tougher challenge for Brown that Republican converted

302
00:17:31.060 --> 00:17:35.770
campaigns on the promise to send the welfare bums back to work among other

303
00:17:35.771 --> 00:17:36.370
matters.

304
00:17:36.370 --> 00:17:40.150
Brown had become unpopular after he went back on a promise not to run for a

305
00:17:40.151 --> 00:17:44.320
third term, then deepened his unpopularity problems during the election,

306
00:17:44.350 --> 00:17:47.950
after he jokingly compared Reagan's who and other former actor,

307
00:17:48.130 --> 00:17:49.120
John Wilkes booth,

308
00:17:49.410 --> 00:17:54.120
the results was a landslide victory for Reagan who won nearly 58% of the vote.

309
00:17:54.360 --> 00:17:56.190
Don't cry too hard for Pat Brown though.

310
00:17:56.280 --> 00:18:00.060
He finished his political career with a one win one loss election record against

311
00:18:00.061 --> 00:18:04.080
future Republican presidents. And well that's not bad.

312
00:18:11.390 --> 00:18:14.540
Reagan was determined to balance the California state budget.

313
00:18:14.541 --> 00:18:16.670
So he froze hiring for state jobs.

314
00:18:16.820 --> 00:18:21.470
He also instituted the largest state tax increase in us history included in his

315
00:18:21.471 --> 00:18:25.250
new tax plan. Well hikes on sales tax cigarettes, alcohol inheritance,

316
00:18:25.340 --> 00:18:29.120
and anyone in the highest tax bracket of owners, even beyond the budget.

317
00:18:29.150 --> 00:18:33.020
Reagan had a highly eventful two times in office as the governor of California,

318
00:18:33.110 --> 00:18:35.780
after campaigning on the promise to clean up the mess of Berkeley,

319
00:18:35.781 --> 00:18:38.330
meaning antiestablishment, student protests, CSUN,

320
00:18:38.360 --> 00:18:42.500
thousands of patrolmen and national guard troops to the university of California

321
00:18:42.501 --> 00:18:44.480
to quell an ongoing civil conflict.

322
00:18:44.510 --> 00:18:48.650
The result was one student death and more than 100 injuries to officers and an

323
00:18:48.651 --> 00:18:50.660
incident known as bloody Thursday.

324
00:18:51.020 --> 00:18:54.140
Reagan also fought a battle over death penalty gallery with the state Supreme

325
00:18:54.141 --> 00:18:57.260
court. He signed into law, the therapeutic abortion act,

326
00:18:57.290 --> 00:19:00.680
which was crafted to help stop dangerous backroom abortions.

327
00:19:00.890 --> 00:19:04.520
He approved it to the family law acts, which legalized no fault divorces.

328
00:19:04.550 --> 00:19:07.490
When he left the California governors mentioned in 1972,

329
00:19:07.640 --> 00:19:09.410
it turned his focus to the white house.

330
00:19:09.470 --> 00:19:11.960
He had flirted with the nomination in 1968,

331
00:19:11.961 --> 00:19:16.220
positioning himself to receive attention while still early on in his first term.

332
00:19:16.221 --> 00:19:17.930
As governor eight years later,

333
00:19:17.990 --> 00:19:22.970
he was ready to challenge a never actually elected president Gerald Ford in

334
00:19:22.971 --> 00:19:24.170
the Republican primary,

335
00:19:24.200 --> 00:19:28.340
the Republican party needed to be steadied after Nixon's Watergate fiasco in the

336
00:19:28.550 --> 00:19:32.540
ensuing midterms, which had been understandably dominated by Democrats.

337
00:19:32.600 --> 00:19:35.240
Reagan believed that he was the man for the job.

338
00:19:35.241 --> 00:19:39.890
And he didn't mind challenging a sitting president Reagan did give 48

339
00:19:39.891 --> 00:19:43.640
significant push announcing his candidacy a full year before the election.

340
00:19:43.641 --> 00:19:45.350
In November of 1975,

341
00:19:45.470 --> 00:19:49.880
neither man was able to obtain the necessary 1,130 votes needed to win the

342
00:19:49.881 --> 00:19:54.260
nomination before the Republican convention feeling he needed a master stroke to

343
00:19:54.410 --> 00:19:55.550
push him over the finish line,

344
00:19:55.580 --> 00:19:59.510
Reagan sought to appeal to the more moderate wing of the party announcing the

345
00:19:59.540 --> 00:20:02.750
liberal Republican Richard Schweiker as his running mate.

346
00:20:02.960 --> 00:20:07.010
The move backfired very few moderates were actually swayed to Reagan signs,

347
00:20:07.011 --> 00:20:11.000
but he did alienated some of his more conservative base, four to one,

348
00:20:11.001 --> 00:20:14.930
his party's nomination than lost in the general elections. A Jimmy Carter,

349
00:20:15.260 --> 00:20:16.093
four years later, though,

350
00:20:16.150 --> 00:20:20.570
the nomination was Reagan's to lose Reagan returned to his successful California

351
00:20:20.571 --> 00:20:24.860
strategy, attacking a swollen federal governments that he believed had overspent

352
00:20:25.070 --> 00:20:30.050
overstimulated and over regulated Carter embroiled in a stagnant economy and an

353
00:20:30.051 --> 00:20:33.170
ongoing hostage crisis in Iran was soundly beaten.

354
00:20:33.410 --> 00:20:38.090
Reagan carried 44 States and won the electoral college 489

355
00:20:38.270 --> 00:20:42.920
to 49. It was one of the largest U S electoral margins of victory ever,

356
00:20:43.070 --> 00:20:47.060
which Reagan promptly surpassed in 1984 when he beat Walter Mondale

357
00:20:47.080 --> 00:20:49.780
525 to 13.

358
00:20:56.070 --> 00:20:58.980
<v 1>Us history is filled with rich ironies, but few of them.</v>

359
00:20:59.190 --> 00:21:03.780
<v 0>Richer than the dramatic conflict and climaxes of the actor turns president's</v>

360
00:21:04.020 --> 00:21:07.590
entire books have been written about the events and nuances of Reagan's

361
00:21:07.591 --> 00:21:12.360
administration, which saw an incredible tornado of events from 1981 to 1989.

362
00:21:12.390 --> 00:21:15.750
I couldn't begin to describe everything that happened across those eight years

363
00:21:16.020 --> 00:21:18.390
in just one section of one video.

364
00:21:18.660 --> 00:21:21.600
<v 3>The reader's digest version though. Well, assassins gums, invasions.</v>

365
00:21:21.650 --> 00:21:25.110
<v 0>The Olympics economy, drugs AIDS, armistice. See what I mean?</v>

366
00:21:25.111 --> 00:21:29.730
Ronald Reagan's presidency in the 1980s sounds like an overstuffed scripts that

367
00:21:29.731 --> 00:21:34.230
he might've read for in the 1940s. So let's start with economics.

368
00:21:34.260 --> 00:21:38.250
The U S economy improved so dramatically in the 1980s that supply-side economics

369
00:21:38.251 --> 00:21:41.610
is often referred to as Reaganomics. When Reagan took office,

370
00:21:41.611 --> 00:21:45.240
the economy was stagnant and inflation was at an all time high for a peacetime

371
00:21:45.241 --> 00:21:46.560
us. His plan,

372
00:21:46.590 --> 00:21:50.160
the long side off the Laffer and other advisors was to cut taxes across the

373
00:21:50.161 --> 00:21:53.610
board in all tax brackets. For example, at that time,

374
00:21:53.611 --> 00:21:58.560
the top tax bracket for high-end has required a 70% tax Reagan reduced the

375
00:21:58.561 --> 00:22:01.620
obligation to 50% over a three-year period.

376
00:22:01.710 --> 00:22:05.580
The U S economy boomed through the 1980s with growth hitting an annual rate of

377
00:22:05.581 --> 00:22:10.170
7.9% over Reagan's eight years in office critics were quick to attribute the

378
00:22:10.171 --> 00:22:14.340
growth to other factors beyond the tax cuts like FECA tax rate increases.

379
00:22:14.370 --> 00:22:18.000
They also pointed out that the robust economic health had done nothing to

380
00:22:18.001 --> 00:22:20.790
improve the federal deficit, which was exploding,

381
00:22:21.270 --> 00:22:24.720
thanks to increase defense spending, but that defense spending was intentional.

382
00:22:24.870 --> 00:22:29.280
Reagan knew years of space raises and nuclear one-upmanship at tanked Soviet

383
00:22:29.281 --> 00:22:32.580
spreadsheets. By the 1980s, they were facing even more problems,

384
00:22:32.910 --> 00:22:35.070
arms conflicts with the majora Dean in Afghanistan,

385
00:22:35.280 --> 00:22:39.600
massive agricultural and manufacturing inefficiencies from its plan to economy.

386
00:22:39.810 --> 00:22:42.390
And by 1985 plummeting oil prices,

387
00:22:42.480 --> 00:22:47.100
Reagan intentionally plans to dramatically escalate us defense spending even

388
00:22:47.101 --> 00:22:50.580
further to push the Soviet Psalms at the brink of economic peril.

389
00:22:50.850 --> 00:22:54.570
His plan included an elaborate missile defense system that was literally called

390
00:22:54.571 --> 00:22:58.140
star Wars. However, when he sends pliability in Soviet leader,

391
00:22:58.170 --> 00:23:01.410
Mikhail Gorbachev, he adopted a more diplomatic approach,

392
00:23:01.440 --> 00:23:05.310
Reagan and Gorbachev engineer negotiated nuclear disarmament after a series of

393
00:23:05.311 --> 00:23:09.780
conversations, including a secret meeting in Iceland in October of 1986,

394
00:23:09.840 --> 00:23:13.380
less than a year later in Berlin Reagan uttered his famous soundbite.

395
00:23:13.740 --> 00:23:17.640
<v 3>Mr. Gorbachev tear down this wall.</v>

396
00:23:17.970 --> 00:23:21.870
<v 0>It directly led to the dismantling of the Soviet union. 29 months later,</v>

397
00:23:22.080 --> 00:23:26.100
Germans could freely pass through the border between the East and West States.

398
00:23:26.220 --> 00:23:29.820
All that isn't to say that there were no failures or problems during the Reagan

399
00:23:29.821 --> 00:23:32.970
presidency, 16 American soldiers died in 1983.

400
00:23:32.971 --> 00:23:35.220
When the us invaded Grenada following a queue,

401
00:23:35.490 --> 00:23:40.320
a bomb in the American barracks in Beirut killed 241 American servicemen during

402
00:23:40.321 --> 00:23:41.460
the Lebanese civil war,

403
00:23:41.520 --> 00:23:45.030
more than 59,000 people died of AIDS during the Reagan presidency,

404
00:23:45.170 --> 00:23:49.130
which was completely unknown prior to his time in office and which he didn't

405
00:23:49.131 --> 00:23:52.280
formally address until the final two years of his presidency,

406
00:23:52.430 --> 00:23:56.510
his wife Nancy helped enact a well-meaning anti-drug campaign go, just say no,

407
00:23:56.511 --> 00:23:58.070
which was certainly well-meaning,

408
00:23:58.280 --> 00:24:02.810
but it failed to recognize many of the chemical and physiological nuances behind

409
00:24:02.870 --> 00:24:03.590
his drug addiction.

410
00:24:03.590 --> 00:24:07.490
Still Reagan's eight years as president of the United States is typically hailed

411
00:24:07.491 --> 00:24:11.750
as a meaningful, successful administration, even buying non-conservatives.

412
00:24:11.750 --> 00:24:15.440
He set the American economy up for 25 years of fairly stable growth.

413
00:24:15.590 --> 00:24:20.030
He nominated Sandra Day O'Connor as the first ever female justice for the U S

414
00:24:20.031 --> 00:24:20.864
Supreme court.

415
00:24:20.930 --> 00:24:24.200
He successfully navigated as an air traffic controller strike that could have

416
00:24:24.201 --> 00:24:28.220
crippled North American logistics and transportation. He used his simple,

417
00:24:28.250 --> 00:24:33.110
clear style of communication to re-emphasize American values and foster a new

418
00:24:33.111 --> 00:24:37.820
sense of American patriotism. And to think it was all almost derailed,

419
00:24:37.850 --> 00:24:42.530
just two months into its short tenure. When on March the 30th, 1981,

420
00:24:42.680 --> 00:24:46.160
a college dropouts and failed artists, John Hinckley Jr.

421
00:24:46.340 --> 00:24:50.720
Attempted to assassinate Reagan while other U S assassins often had political

422
00:24:50.721 --> 00:24:51.554
motivations.

423
00:24:51.740 --> 00:24:55.100
And Kenny Jr had developed a pathological obsession with the actress,

424
00:24:55.130 --> 00:24:58.160
Jodie foster, after watching the movie taxi driver,

425
00:24:58.161 --> 00:25:02.000
and he saw the assassination of a us president as a brilliant plan to get her

426
00:25:02.001 --> 00:25:06.410
attention. So after Reagan had addressed the AFL CIO conference in Washington,

427
00:25:06.411 --> 00:25:10.760
DC Hinckley discharged a 22 caliber revolver at him and his retinue

428
00:25:11.030 --> 00:25:15.050
injuring four people in the Optima press secretary James Brady was permanently

429
00:25:15.051 --> 00:25:17.120
disabled. Hinkley was tried,

430
00:25:17.270 --> 00:25:20.090
but ultimately found not guilty by reason of insanity.

431
00:25:20.210 --> 00:25:21.830
He called the assassination attempt.

432
00:25:22.010 --> 00:25:24.530
The greatest love offering in the history of the world.

433
00:25:24.710 --> 00:25:28.820
His verdicts prompted a reformation on criminal insanity, please.

434
00:25:29.090 --> 00:25:33.130
As for the 40th president Reagan made a full recovery after being struck by a

435
00:25:33.470 --> 00:25:35.720
bullets ricocheted off the presidential limousine.

436
00:25:35.870 --> 00:25:37.640
He later told his adopted son, Michael,

437
00:25:37.641 --> 00:25:41.930
that he believed he had been sped by God to fulfill a higher purpose,

438
00:25:42.020 --> 00:25:46.820
whether or not the Reagan presidency was directly sanctioned by God is an

439
00:25:46.821 --> 00:25:49.760
answer. You don't have to find on another YouTube channel,

440
00:25:49.790 --> 00:25:54.200
but it's hard to argue that the Reagan presidency wasn't immensely

441
00:25:54.201 --> 00:25:58.790
consequential beyond a surging economy and the end of the cold war Reagan

442
00:25:58.820 --> 00:26:02.840
refocused American conservatives after decades of rudderless partisan

443
00:26:02.841 --> 00:26:06.890
challenges, he set the stage for 21st century American politics,

444
00:26:06.891 --> 00:26:11.420
coalescing mainstream conservatism around supply side fiscal policies,

445
00:26:11.540 --> 00:26:14.900
small government principles and individual responsibility.

446
00:26:15.230 --> 00:26:18.710
Reagan didn't lead much of a life after his presidency. When he was elected,

447
00:26:18.711 --> 00:26:19.850
he was already 69,

448
00:26:19.851 --> 00:26:23.300
which was the oldest president had ever been upon his inauguration.

449
00:26:23.510 --> 00:26:27.770
By the time he was succeeded by his vice president, George H w Bush in 1989,

450
00:26:27.980 --> 00:26:30.050
he was nearing 80 by 1994.

451
00:26:30.080 --> 00:26:32.810
He had announced that he was suffering from Alzheimer's disease.

452
00:26:33.080 --> 00:26:36.500
From that he kept his circle close. As the disease progressed,

453
00:26:36.620 --> 00:26:40.340
he was only able to recognize his wife and a few other close friends.

454
00:26:40.520 --> 00:26:42.290
He died at home on June the fifth,

455
00:26:42.320 --> 00:26:45.600
2004 at the age of 93 after his death,

456
00:26:45.630 --> 00:26:50.220
his body lay in repose that both his presidential library and in the written

457
00:26:50.400 --> 00:26:53.670
dura of the us Capitol building more than 200,000 people came to pay their

458
00:26:53.671 --> 00:26:57.270
respects. First in California, then in Washington, DC.

459
00:26:57.510 --> 00:27:00.300
And that's appears to be the enduring legacy of Ronald Reagan.

460
00:27:00.360 --> 00:27:02.760
Now 15 years removed from the end of his life,

461
00:27:03.060 --> 00:27:07.320
whether you agree or disagree with his policies and conservative outlooks,

462
00:27:07.470 --> 00:27:10.260
he was a galvanizing force in American culture.

463
00:27:10.470 --> 00:27:12.360
This brought thousands of people together.

464
00:27:12.570 --> 00:27:17.160
He's the most influential American politician since FDR and has become

465
00:27:17.310 --> 00:27:20.340
true North for millions of American conservatives.

466
00:27:20.490 --> 00:27:24.690
It's an appropriate legacy for a complex man of many interests for a political

467
00:27:24.691 --> 00:27:27.690
faction that often sings of the limitless potential of America.

468
00:27:27.900 --> 00:27:32.460
It's fitting that modern day icon was a man who seemed to be just about

469
00:27:32.490 --> 00:27:37.410
capable of anything. So I really hope you enjoyed that video. If you did,
