6
00:00:22.310 --> 00:00:23.090
He's bloody.

7
00:00:23.090 --> 00:00:27.380
Mary May simply evoke images of a stick of celery in a tall glass or

8
00:00:27.650 --> 00:00:29.570
memories of your last brunch.

9
00:00:29.600 --> 00:00:33.260
But the origin of the term comes of course from queen Mary,

10
00:00:33.261 --> 00:00:35.810
the first of England, daughter of Henry, the eighth,

11
00:00:35.870 --> 00:00:39.950
who led of Ireland's Catholic counter reformation against Protestantism.

12
00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:43.970
But is that all there is to know about Mary Tudor?

13
00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:48.920
Well stick with us today and we'll learn about Mary's unhappy upbringing

14
00:00:48.921 --> 00:00:50.750
and her troubled reign play.

15
00:00:50.870 --> 00:00:53.600
You get to buy personal and political disappointments.

16
00:00:59.870 --> 00:01:00.703
<v 1>Princess.</v>

17
00:01:00.760 --> 00:01:02.540
<v 0>It was the first surviving child or King Henry,</v>

18
00:01:02.541 --> 00:01:05.270
the eighth of England's and Catherine queen of arrogant.

19
00:01:05.300 --> 00:01:08.630
When Mary came into the world on February the 18th, 15, 16,

20
00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:12.020
her father welcomes her as the greatest Parlin in the kingdom.

21
00:01:12.110 --> 00:01:14.120
As proud as Henry might have been,

22
00:01:14.121 --> 00:01:16.550
he rarely showed her affection to his daughter.

23
00:01:16.610 --> 00:01:21.140
The King was more interested in using Mary as a diplomatic porn and the complex

24
00:01:21.141 --> 00:01:25.160
game of alliances that had engulfed England France and the Holy Roman empire.

25
00:01:25.250 --> 00:01:26.750
When Mary was just two years old,

26
00:01:26.751 --> 00:01:31.640
she was betrothed to the doleful or Prince of France Francis. The third,

27
00:01:31.820 --> 00:01:35.870
this wedding arrangements among two infants was all kinds of inappropriate,

28
00:01:35.871 --> 00:01:39.260
and it was intended to secure an Alliance between England and France.

29
00:01:39.650 --> 00:01:40.221
Four years later,

30
00:01:40.221 --> 00:01:44.780
diplomatic relations between the two kingdom soured and the cringe factor just

31
00:01:44.781 --> 00:01:45.614
escalated.

32
00:01:45.710 --> 00:01:49.190
The six-year-old Mary was now offered in marriage to her mother's cousin,

33
00:01:49.220 --> 00:01:53.300
the Holy Roman emperor, Charles, the fifth, who was aged 22.

34
00:01:53.390 --> 00:01:54.620
The marriage never took place,

35
00:01:54.770 --> 00:01:57.860
but mother Catherine wanted to ensure that Mary would be raised as a proper

36
00:01:57.861 --> 00:02:02.120
princess worthy of an emperor. Mary was tutored by a Spanish Tuto,

37
00:02:02.150 --> 00:02:06.650
one new Eve S who outlines our curriculum in the treaters called the

38
00:02:06.651 --> 00:02:09.140
education of a Christian woman. According to Viv,

39
00:02:09.470 --> 00:02:13.250
as young girls should be prepared for a life of humility, self sacrifice,

40
00:02:13.251 --> 00:02:16.160
and to BDO once in the company of virtuous women,

41
00:02:16.250 --> 00:02:18.170
men on the other hand should be avoided.

42
00:02:18.320 --> 00:02:21.320
Girls should also restrain the fire of their youth.

43
00:02:21.530 --> 00:02:25.070
It is preferable that they learn instead to weave and spin,

44
00:02:25.071 --> 00:02:29.360
which includes a love of sober sadness. In other words, Catherine,

45
00:02:29.361 --> 00:02:33.880
and Viva's raising marriage. You become a rather submissive young lady,

46
00:02:33.900 --> 00:02:36.110
devoid of spirit and initiative,

47
00:02:36.170 --> 00:02:38.450
but Mary had another role model in our household,

48
00:02:38.900 --> 00:02:43.010
albeit one who dedicated her little attention, Henry the eighth from him,

49
00:02:43.040 --> 00:02:46.940
Mary inherited a love of writing and hunting and to talent for playing the loose

50
00:02:46.941 --> 00:02:51.440
and dancing. The King started to take notice of these, not so dainty traits.

51
00:02:51.530 --> 00:02:55.010
So in the summer of 1525, he sent the nine year old lady married,

52
00:02:55.011 --> 00:02:57.590
a Ludlow castle, and the Welsh marches.

53
00:02:57.830 --> 00:03:02.470
This relocation carried a great symbolic value by presiding over that court,

54
00:03:02.620 --> 00:03:07.480
Mary effectively acted as princess of Wales making her a prospect to inherit the

55
00:03:07.481 --> 00:03:11.200
throne. Mary stayed in Ludlow in Seoul just after her 11th birthday.

56
00:03:11.201 --> 00:03:15.100
When threats of a Welsh rebellion made it safer for her to leave for London.

57
00:03:15.190 --> 00:03:18.070
When she returns, Mary was masked by a very tense situation.

58
00:03:18.280 --> 00:03:21.550
Henry had informed queen Catherine that he intended to divorce,

59
00:03:21.760 --> 00:03:25.360
that he was having a relationship with Ann Berlin, Mary stock,

60
00:03:25.361 --> 00:03:29.020
by how grieving mother trying to console her through that difficult period from

61
00:03:29.021 --> 00:03:31.270
1527 to 1533.

62
00:03:31.510 --> 00:03:34.780
Now I won't go into all of the details of the annulments of Henry and

63
00:03:34.781 --> 00:03:36.070
Catherine's marriage,

64
00:03:36.100 --> 00:03:40.570
but one of the best known consequences of this was the schism of the church of

65
00:03:41.020 --> 00:03:45.010
England from Catholicism 10 years after the beginning of the reformation major

66
00:03:45.011 --> 00:03:49.510
European court adhere to Protestantism from Mary's perspective,

67
00:03:49.720 --> 00:03:53.200
the schism from the church of Rome had deep personal connections.

68
00:03:53.350 --> 00:03:57.730
Catholicism was her religion, as well as a mother's Protestantism.

69
00:03:58.180 --> 00:04:02.740
The reformation represented the faith of Catherine's rival and Berlin,

70
00:04:02.741 --> 00:04:07.240
which Henry had opportunistically embraced in July of 1533,

71
00:04:07.241 --> 00:04:11.110
the 17 year old Mary was informed that her parents' marriage had been pronounced

72
00:04:11.111 --> 00:04:14.280
invalid unless Henry and Nan were now man and wife never.

73
00:04:14.281 --> 00:04:17.740
He was also told that she could no longer communicate with her mother and things

74
00:04:17.741 --> 00:04:21.970
went from bad to worse after the 7th of September, 1533,

75
00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:26.770
that is when Anne gave birth to princess Elizabeth. The future queen of England,

76
00:04:26.860 --> 00:04:30.970
Mary was stripped of her total of princess and or to discern as a maid of honor

77
00:04:30.971 --> 00:04:31.720
to Elizabeth.

78
00:04:31.720 --> 00:04:35.800
The teenage Mary was moved to a new residence Hatfield house book off to a

79
00:04:36.160 --> 00:04:36.730
health system.

80
00:04:36.730 --> 00:04:40.420
She had been removed from her mother runs from her beloved lady in waiting

81
00:04:40.600 --> 00:04:41.440
Margaret pole.

82
00:04:41.710 --> 00:04:45.820
She had also been assigned to the worst lodgings in Hatfield and was routinely

83
00:04:45.821 --> 00:04:48.370
humiliated by members of Elisabeth's households.

84
00:04:48.400 --> 00:04:51.550
Chief among them was lady Shelton. The aunt of Anne Boleyn,

85
00:04:51.640 --> 00:04:54.940
any other Cinderella would have accepted how fate is an errand girl,

86
00:04:55.240 --> 00:04:59.110
well staging musical routines with a bunch of mice,

87
00:04:59.140 --> 00:05:01.510
but Mary fought back with quiet dignity.

88
00:05:01.570 --> 00:05:05.890
She always refused to address Elizabeth as princess and faint deafness.

89
00:05:05.891 --> 00:05:10.750
If somebody addressed her as lady Mary, rather than princess Mary lady Shelton,

90
00:05:10.751 --> 00:05:13.210
retaliated by confiscating her clothes and jewelry,

91
00:05:13.211 --> 00:05:16.210
or even by abusing both verbally and physically,

92
00:05:16.270 --> 00:05:18.200
if King Henry came around to visit Elizabeth,

93
00:05:18.280 --> 00:05:20.830
the lady Shelton ensured that Mary was locked up,

94
00:05:20.890 --> 00:05:24.220
preventing her from seeing how thought that Mary continued with her quiet

95
00:05:24.221 --> 00:05:24.730
rebellion.

96
00:05:24.730 --> 00:05:28.570
She learned how to exchange secret messages with a mother with the help of loyal

97
00:05:28.571 --> 00:05:32.200
servants. Mary could also count on another ally, the Envoy of Charles,

98
00:05:32.201 --> 00:05:35.620
the fifth to London, Spanish ambassador Eustis to poise.

99
00:05:35.830 --> 00:05:39.310
Two boys became a good friend and made several attempts to intervene on her

100
00:05:39.311 --> 00:05:43.900
behalf at court alas, they were all unsuccessful in 1534,

101
00:05:43.901 --> 00:05:46.510
the English parliament ratified the act of supremacy,

102
00:05:46.511 --> 00:05:49.990
which made the schism from Rome official and recognized. Henry.

103
00:05:49.991 --> 00:05:51.640
The eighth was head of the church of England.

104
00:05:51.670 --> 00:05:54.280
Mary was supposed to take a note recognizing him as such,

105
00:05:54.281 --> 00:05:58.610
but she refused accepting the act of supremacy means admitting that Henry and

106
00:05:58.611 --> 00:06:03.320
Catherine's marriage was illegal. Rejecting such an oath was equal to treason,

107
00:06:03.350 --> 00:06:06.290
punishable by death, but Henry showing mercy,

108
00:06:06.500 --> 00:06:09.620
let his daughter live at the beginning of February,

109
00:06:09.620 --> 00:06:12.440
1535 just before her 19th birthday, Mary fell ill.

110
00:06:12.530 --> 00:06:15.530
She had been suffering for some time from stomach pains, headaches,

111
00:06:15.531 --> 00:06:17.690
and depression. But on that occasion,

112
00:06:17.780 --> 00:06:21.320
her symptoms were worse than ever somebody at court, even suspected poisoning.

113
00:06:21.530 --> 00:06:25.130
Henry had the good idea of sending her away from Hatfield to recover at the

114
00:06:25.131 --> 00:06:27.620
Royal palace in Greenwich and recover.

115
00:06:27.680 --> 00:06:31.100
She did albeit very slowly but barely one year later,

116
00:06:31.160 --> 00:06:33.590
Mary received yet another devastating blow.

117
00:06:33.830 --> 00:06:38.810
They Dee Shelton without tax or petty announced. This is on the 12th of January,

118
00:06:38.810 --> 00:06:40.520
1536, Catherine of Aragon, uh, died.

119
00:06:46.780 --> 00:06:47.380
<v 2>[Inaudible].</v>

120
00:06:47.380 --> 00:06:48.970
<v 0>What I'm going to improve. When King George,</v>

121
00:06:48.971 --> 00:06:53.380
the AIDS grew tired of his new wife or may the 19th, 1536 and Berlin's graceful.

122
00:06:53.381 --> 00:06:57.400
Neck was struck by the execution, a risk, the tower of London.

123
00:06:57.460 --> 00:07:01.300
She had been executed on trumped up charges of infidelity incest with her own

124
00:07:01.301 --> 00:07:03.640
brother runs conspiracy to kill the King.

125
00:07:03.670 --> 00:07:07.030
These accusations had been concocted by the King and his minister,

126
00:07:07.060 --> 00:07:07.990
Thomas Cromwell.

127
00:07:08.050 --> 00:07:12.070
There were many reasons behind the execution and it fails to give birth to a

128
00:07:12.071 --> 00:07:16.270
male heir or an opposed in Alliance with the Holy Roman empire favoring,

129
00:07:16.271 --> 00:07:19.210
the French or the King simply wanted to remarry.

130
00:07:19.300 --> 00:07:21.700
What's massive for Mary is that Henry's new wife.

131
00:07:21.730 --> 00:07:25.330
Jane Seymour had every intention to build a good relationship with that.

132
00:07:25.420 --> 00:07:26.830
In the summer of 1536,

133
00:07:26.831 --> 00:07:30.280
Mary was summoned to decor to meet her father for the first time in five years

134
00:07:30.340 --> 00:07:34.480
at the time she was 20 years old and Henry had lost her as a troubled teenager.

135
00:07:34.690 --> 00:07:36.910
He was now impressed by an intelligent,

136
00:07:37.450 --> 00:07:41.710
confident woman who had survived years of abuse and neglect with dignity during

137
00:07:41.711 --> 00:07:43.090
Christmas 1536,

138
00:07:43.091 --> 00:07:46.390
the lady Mary was formally welcomed back at court for it to happen.

139
00:07:46.420 --> 00:07:50.410
She was eventually forced to sign a document recognizing Catherine and Henry's

140
00:07:50.411 --> 00:07:53.290
marriage is unlawful. Nonetheless, thanks to the family.

141
00:07:53.291 --> 00:07:57.220
Unity created by queen Jane. Mary enjoyed a newfound happiness,

142
00:07:57.250 --> 00:08:00.430
but the days of our benefactor, when numbered, because on October the 12th,

143
00:08:00.460 --> 00:08:01.450
1537,

144
00:08:01.600 --> 00:08:06.460
Jane fulfilled Henry's most persistent wish by giving birth to a son. Edward,

145
00:08:06.550 --> 00:08:10.870
finally, this was the male ad that everyone was hoping for. Except of course,

146
00:08:10.871 --> 00:08:12.910
for Mary ambitious and intelligent,

147
00:08:12.911 --> 00:08:17.650
she knew her best path to the throne would not involve male as older

148
00:08:17.740 --> 00:08:20.650
or younger. The birth of the Prince had another consequence.

149
00:08:21.040 --> 00:08:23.740
Jenn was confined to bed with a bout of pure Aperol fever,

150
00:08:23.741 --> 00:08:26.680
a fever caused by uterine infection, following childbirth.

151
00:08:26.980 --> 00:08:31.840
She died 12 days later on the 24th of October King Henry was stricken with heavy

152
00:08:31.841 --> 00:08:34.360
grief. He dealt with it in an emotionally mature way.

153
00:08:34.361 --> 00:08:37.510
He left England's all together to pursue diplomatic missions.

154
00:08:37.930 --> 00:08:40.870
Nary remains a court further blossoming into a well-liked member of the Royal

155
00:08:40.871 --> 00:08:41.470
household.

156
00:08:41.470 --> 00:08:45.070
She was a pious young women attending mass everyday and offering donations to

157
00:08:45.071 --> 00:08:48.400
impoverish members of the clergy, but she also enjoyed hunting,

158
00:08:48.430 --> 00:08:52.120
playing cards and attending shows with jesters foreign ambassadors,

159
00:08:52.450 --> 00:08:56.010
Dalton to take note of the young lady admiring her intelligence nature and good

160
00:08:56.011 --> 00:08:59.820
looks. She would have made a perfect bride for some foreign Prince. Well,

161
00:09:00.300 --> 00:09:03.090
in theory in practice, her position was ambiguous.

162
00:09:03.180 --> 00:09:05.610
Mary was formerly an illegitimate child. I mean,

163
00:09:05.670 --> 00:09:08.400
remember that document that she was forced to sign moreover,

164
00:09:08.460 --> 00:09:12.240
a potential future groom of Mary's good lay claims to the throne,

165
00:09:12.270 --> 00:09:15.360
threatening the legitimate heir Prince Edward for this reason,

166
00:09:15.361 --> 00:09:17.280
King Henry kept several suitors at Bay,

167
00:09:17.310 --> 00:09:20.550
but of course he didn't have any problems with his ongoing nuptials.

168
00:09:20.610 --> 00:09:21.810
In January of 1540.

169
00:09:21.811 --> 00:09:26.100
He married down of plebes before quickly swiping left and tying the knot with

170
00:09:26.910 --> 00:09:30.090
Catherine Howard. Catherine's date of birth is uncertain, but she was for sure,

171
00:09:30.091 --> 00:09:31.980
younger than her stepdaughter. Mary,

172
00:09:32.070 --> 00:09:36.270
initially the past Mary did not get along with dad's latest trophy wife,

173
00:09:36.300 --> 00:09:38.580
but just as the two young ladies were becoming friends,

174
00:09:38.730 --> 00:09:42.510
Henry received a letter from the Archbishop of Canterbury Thomas Crowner.

175
00:09:42.810 --> 00:09:46.440
It accused Catherine of past and present sexual liaisons.

176
00:09:46.560 --> 00:09:50.340
Henry announced a treason and had Catherine executed on February the 13th,

177
00:09:50.341 --> 00:09:54.360
1542 following year Henry married for the sixth time with Catherine Paul,

178
00:09:54.660 --> 00:09:59.100
like Jean Zemo before her was able to recreate some degree of family unity.

179
00:09:59.160 --> 00:10:02.760
Mary enjoyed some quite happy time playing with Elizabeth and Edward.

180
00:10:02.940 --> 00:10:05.550
She had now grown fond of a much younger half siblings,

181
00:10:05.700 --> 00:10:08.610
but there was a growing cloud over their future. This Henry,

182
00:10:08.611 --> 00:10:12.150
the eighth's grew older. I mean, what would happen after the death of the King,

183
00:10:12.270 --> 00:10:14.340
but just before we get into what will happen,

184
00:10:14.341 --> 00:10:15.840

201
00:11:11.250 --> 00:11:12.330
Let's get back to the video.

202
00:11:18.890 --> 00:11:19.250
<v 1>Henry.</v>

203
00:11:19.250 --> 00:11:21.260
<v 0>And on January the 28th, 1547,</v>

204
00:11:21.350 --> 00:11:24.590
his son was crowned as King Edward the sixth at nine years of age,

205
00:11:25.040 --> 00:11:28.820
Mary withdrew to East Anglia, where she held her sort of parallel court,

206
00:11:28.821 --> 00:11:33.200
which always included a Catholic priest reciting mass four times a day as King

207
00:11:33.201 --> 00:11:36.140
Edward and his court continued the path to Protestantism.

208
00:11:36.290 --> 00:11:40.550
Mary began to believe that her destiny was to keep the Catholic faith alive in

209
00:11:40.551 --> 00:11:44.420
England. This conviction was reinforced by the ambassadors of Charles the fifth,

210
00:11:44.600 --> 00:11:49.220
who had every interest in maintaining influence over her cousin and 1549.

211
00:11:49.221 --> 00:11:51.740
The act of uniformity, outlawed Catholic mass,

212
00:11:51.741 --> 00:11:54.760
replacing edge with services from the book of common prayer.

213
00:11:55.120 --> 00:11:57.940
Mary would not comply with the act as she wrote to Charles,

214
00:11:57.941 --> 00:12:01.690
the Fest in life or death. I will not forsake the Catholic religion,

215
00:12:01.810 --> 00:12:05.020
even if compelled there too, by threats or violence,

216
00:12:05.140 --> 00:12:08.230
a personal champion was intimidated on orders of Edward Seymour.

217
00:12:08.230 --> 00:12:09.340
The Duke of Somerset.

218
00:12:09.520 --> 00:12:13.030
This gentlemen was the uncle and Lord protector to the young King.

219
00:12:13.390 --> 00:12:15.790
Edward eventually Seymour proved to be quite lenient,

220
00:12:15.791 --> 00:12:18.820
allowing Mary to celebrate the Catholic rights privately,

221
00:12:18.940 --> 00:12:21.820
but CMOs tenure as Lord protector was short-lived.

222
00:12:21.821 --> 00:12:23.440
And his success of John Dudley,

223
00:12:23.441 --> 00:12:27.280
Duke of Northumberland was openly hostile to Mary and Catholicism.

224
00:12:27.340 --> 00:12:32.200
He defined a as the conduit by which the wraps of room or might creep into the

225
00:12:33.010 --> 00:12:35.860
strongholds Dudley and even King Edward issued intimidations to Mary,

226
00:12:35.861 --> 00:12:39.250
that she stopped celebrating mass, but she defiantly persisted.

227
00:12:39.340 --> 00:12:42.970
This religious tug of war continued until February, 1553.

228
00:12:42.971 --> 00:12:46.390
When Mary started hearing rumors about the King's ill health,

229
00:12:46.420 --> 00:12:47.500
the 15 year old Edward,

230
00:12:47.501 --> 00:12:51.700
the sixth was in fact suffering from severe tuberculosis and he was

231
00:12:51.701 --> 00:12:52.930
deteriorating quickly.

232
00:12:53.020 --> 00:12:57.040
This was the beginning of a deal of wits between Mary and John Dudley with the

233
00:12:57.640 --> 00:12:58.960
prize being the throne of England,

234
00:12:59.020 --> 00:13:02.980
Mary considered herself to be the rifle out of the crown while Dudley was ready

235
00:13:02.981 --> 00:13:06.610
to sponsor another candidates in order to prevent a Catholic from becoming

236
00:13:06.611 --> 00:13:09.850
queen. This was Dudley's daughter-in-law lady Jane grey,

237
00:13:09.851 --> 00:13:14.380
who happened to also be the great granddaughter of the first two to King Henry

238
00:13:14.381 --> 00:13:17.500
the seventh at the beginning of July, 1553,

239
00:13:17.620 --> 00:13:19.810
Mary was in her Hartford sheer residence.

240
00:13:19.811 --> 00:13:23.530
When she received a summons to Greenwich palace to sit by her dying.

241
00:13:23.950 --> 00:13:28.000
Rather Mary feared this to be a trap from Dudley and she added a Norfolk instead

242
00:13:28.240 --> 00:13:32.260
East of London, when she reached a court in Kenning hall on July the ninth,

243
00:13:32.261 --> 00:13:34.750
she learns that ed would have died three days prior,

244
00:13:34.990 --> 00:13:38.830
but the worst piece of news was that Dudley son was heading to Norfolk to

245
00:13:38.831 --> 00:13:41.410
capture her Mary acted quickly and decisively.

246
00:13:41.530 --> 00:13:45.250
She pronounced a self rightful queen of England's before her household and sent

247
00:13:45.251 --> 00:13:46.210
a message to Dudley,

248
00:13:46.211 --> 00:13:49.900
ordering him to accept our Rose Monarch Mary's message received Dudley.

249
00:13:49.901 --> 00:13:53.080
When he was hosting a banquet for queen Jane grey,

250
00:13:53.081 --> 00:13:57.130
which must have been all kinds of awkward Dudley had reassured queen and Jane

251
00:13:57.510 --> 00:14:00.880
Nancy's, his allies that Mary would be easily tamed and controls,

252
00:14:00.910 --> 00:14:02.470
but Mary would not yield.

253
00:14:02.471 --> 00:14:06.520
And she started to amass an army of supporters recruited from the gentlemen and

254
00:14:06.521 --> 00:14:09.010
peasants of East Anglia. Dudley had not been idle,

255
00:14:09.011 --> 00:14:11.740
either sending an army and the fleet to confront Mary,

256
00:14:12.130 --> 00:14:15.910
but the old were quickly turning against him by the 16th of July Mary's army

257
00:14:15.911 --> 00:14:16.211
numbered,

258
00:14:16.211 --> 00:14:20.980
about 30,000 and Dudley's fleet had switched sides on the 18th.

259
00:14:21.010 --> 00:14:25.390
John Dudley yielded to his new queen and on August the third, 1553,

260
00:14:25.510 --> 00:14:29.230
Mary Tudor Rhodes triumphantly into London proclaimed as the new queen of

261
00:14:29.231 --> 00:14:33.610
England. She succeeded the unlucky lady, Jane grey queen of night and day.

262
00:14:40.830 --> 00:14:41.160
<v 1>England's welcome.</v>

263
00:14:41.160 --> 00:14:43.350
<v 0>Mary, as a rightful heir to the throne,</v>

264
00:14:43.380 --> 00:14:47.640
she was first and foremost and adults and intelligent women heavily contrasted

265
00:14:47.641 --> 00:14:50.910
against the previous boy King, but nobody knew what to,

266
00:14:51.380 --> 00:14:52.970
from a single queen as Monarch,

267
00:14:53.030 --> 00:14:55.970
the only precedents have been queen Matilda in the 12th century,

268
00:14:56.570 --> 00:15:00.110
reign remembered as a chaotic time, but Mary got off to a good start,

269
00:15:00.140 --> 00:15:04.730
making an impression as a virtuous conscientious and kind sovereign. Sure.

270
00:15:04.731 --> 00:15:08.420
She had Dudley's head chopped off even after he had recanted his Protestant

271
00:15:08.421 --> 00:15:08.840
faith,

272
00:15:08.840 --> 00:15:13.280
but Mary was very lenient toward Dudley's allies and especially lady Jane grey,

273
00:15:13.281 --> 00:15:15.980
who received a short sentence to be served at the tower of London.

274
00:15:16.100 --> 00:15:18.770
The new queen gave proof of her great tolerances.

275
00:15:18.920 --> 00:15:23.900
She had no intention to compel or constrain other men's consciouses straight

276
00:15:23.901 --> 00:15:27.020
off the bat. Mary launched a series of much needed reforms.

277
00:15:27.080 --> 00:15:30.980
English finances were in dark condition after years of malpractice endorsed by

278
00:15:30.981 --> 00:15:31.910
Dudley Edward,

279
00:15:31.911 --> 00:15:36.350
the sixth and Henry the eighth Mary's predecessors have taken to debasing the

280
00:15:36.650 --> 00:15:40.070
coin at Joel lower in the proportion of golden silver and English circulation.

281
00:15:40.130 --> 00:15:42.590
This debasement increased cashflow in the economy,

282
00:15:42.591 --> 00:15:46.400
but eventually curbed foreign trade. What was the point of trading with England?

283
00:15:46.610 --> 00:15:50.030
The pound was becoming worthless. Mary revalued, the currency.

284
00:15:50.160 --> 00:15:52.460
And as while she initially intended to curb public spending,

285
00:15:52.461 --> 00:15:55.430
she understood the necessity of investing in the military.

286
00:15:55.580 --> 00:15:59.330
She expanded the Navy and incentivized exploration in the new world's a

287
00:15:59.960 --> 00:16:03.050
long-term program whose rewards would be reaped by her successes,

288
00:16:03.350 --> 00:16:07.010
but let's stay in the presence with the crown firmly on her head.

289
00:16:07.070 --> 00:16:11.090
The Queen's counselors and subjects were busy with another question was Mary

290
00:16:11.120 --> 00:16:13.520
intending to marry. And if so, when,

291
00:16:13.700 --> 00:16:17.570
and to whom Mary had the same question in mind and sought the advice of Charles

292
00:16:17.571 --> 00:16:21.320
the fifth, no surprise. The Habsburg emperor chose his only son,

293
00:16:21.740 --> 00:16:25.280
Phillip Phillip had a reputation for being kind of dull, but on the plus side,

294
00:16:25.281 --> 00:16:29.930
he was dignified serious 11 years younger than Mary and fantastically rich upon

295
00:16:29.931 --> 00:16:31.070
the death of his father.

296
00:16:31.100 --> 00:16:34.970
He would contribute to two pieces of prime real estate to a potential role in

297
00:16:34.971 --> 00:16:37.730
marriage. The Netherlands and Spain.

298
00:16:37.790 --> 00:16:41.480
This is to say that a union between Mary and Phillip would have brought together

299
00:16:41.660 --> 00:16:43.400
two great powers. However,

300
00:16:43.401 --> 00:16:47.180
Mary's counselors realized that England would have been the junior partner in

301
00:16:47.181 --> 00:16:51.560
such an Alliance and England would likely become just another Habsburg dominion.

302
00:16:51.650 --> 00:16:55.310
The Protestants within England's were also worried about the potential influence

303
00:16:55.311 --> 00:16:58.730
of Spanish Catholic clergy, but Mary had made up her mind.

304
00:16:58.760 --> 00:17:03.260
She would marry Philip whom she had seen only once in a portrait by Titian on

305
00:17:03.261 --> 00:17:06.410
November the eighth, 1553. She announced her intentions, Mary Phillip,

306
00:17:06.560 --> 00:17:10.730
and in January of 1554, she concluded a marriage treaty with Charles the fifth.

307
00:17:10.940 --> 00:17:13.550
The news was badly received by a group of conspiring.

308
00:17:13.551 --> 00:17:17.600
No woman led by sir Thomas White, the plot also involved Henry Gray,

309
00:17:17.601 --> 00:17:18.830
father of lady Jane.

310
00:17:18.860 --> 00:17:21.680
The plan called for four separate armies to March into London,

311
00:17:21.681 --> 00:17:25.700
seize the court and replace Mary with a half sister Elizabeth sat to marry an

312
00:17:25.701 --> 00:17:27.320
English nobleman the plan, however,

313
00:17:27.350 --> 00:17:31.070
reached the ears of the Spanish ambassador who notified Mary's main advisor,

314
00:17:31.100 --> 00:17:35.120
Lord chancellor, Stephen garden at the rebel Alliance of nobleman melted away.

315
00:17:35.121 --> 00:17:39.560
But Thomas Wyatt did not back down on January the 26th, 1554.

316
00:17:39.980 --> 00:17:43.160
Washington does small army occupied the Kentish town of Rochester issuing a

317
00:17:43.161 --> 00:17:44.840
proclamation against the queen.

318
00:17:44.900 --> 00:17:47.450
Mary sent two contingents to suppress the uprising,

319
00:17:47.451 --> 00:17:51.990
but most of those soldiers swapped sides and joined Wyatt in less than a week.

320
00:17:52.170 --> 00:17:55.950
He had rallied 4,000 men at his command ready to March on London.

321
00:17:56.070 --> 00:17:57.780
Mary's counselors advised at a fleet,

322
00:17:57.800 --> 00:17:59.640
but the queen would not have it on February.

323
00:17:59.641 --> 00:18:03.870
The first she delivered a rousing speech to Londoners rallying their support two

324
00:18:03.871 --> 00:18:04.231
days a day.

325
00:18:04.231 --> 00:18:07.290
So why it's army arrived at the tower of London expecting to find little

326
00:18:07.291 --> 00:18:09.260
resistance? They were solely wrong.

327
00:18:09.440 --> 00:18:13.070
They found that Mary supporters blocked all bridges and we're in control of the

328
00:18:13.071 --> 00:18:17.060
artillery atop the tower after a failed attempt to outmaneuver the defense's

329
00:18:17.420 --> 00:18:20.210
watt surrender. It is easy to guess. The face of Thomas Weiss,

330
00:18:20.360 --> 00:18:25.130
he ends 90 of his co-conspirators were tried and executed that bodies were left

331
00:18:25.131 --> 00:18:28.280
to rot in the open as a warning against future rebellions.

332
00:18:28.370 --> 00:18:32.540
The aftermath of the rebellion did not spare two ladies who may have posed a

333
00:18:32.541 --> 00:18:35.840
threat to queen Mary. The first was our half sister, lady Elizabeth,

334
00:18:35.870 --> 00:18:39.320
who had been approached by watt and friends to join their uprising.

335
00:18:39.350 --> 00:18:41.480
But during a hearing with Mary's counselors,

336
00:18:41.700 --> 00:18:44.120
Elizabeth managed to distance herself from the plot.

337
00:18:44.180 --> 00:18:48.200
Mary realized that Elizabeth May still become a rallying figure for Protestant

338
00:18:48.201 --> 00:18:51.020
schemes. And so she put her under house arrest for one year.

339
00:18:51.050 --> 00:18:53.630
The second lady was the former queen Jane Gray,

340
00:18:53.631 --> 00:18:56.060
and she did not get away so easily.

341
00:18:56.120 --> 00:19:00.020
Her father Henry has been one of the rebels and she still carried legitimate

342
00:19:00.021 --> 00:19:02.960
claims to the throne on February the 12th, 1554,

343
00:19:02.961 --> 00:19:06.620
lady Jane grey was beheaded at the tower of London with the anti Spanish.

344
00:19:06.621 --> 00:19:09.110
And anti-Catholic conspirators out of the way.

345
00:19:09.410 --> 00:19:10.970
Mary was free to marry Prince Phillip,

346
00:19:11.000 --> 00:19:13.730
albeit with some clauses out into the marriage treaty,

347
00:19:13.731 --> 00:19:16.400
which became the sort of ultimate prenup.

348
00:19:16.520 --> 00:19:19.970
And now stipulated that Phillip would be King of England only for the duration

349
00:19:19.971 --> 00:19:23.930
of the marriage. And he would be unable to issue any proclamations or treaties.

350
00:19:24.140 --> 00:19:28.250
He could also not appoint any foreigners to the English council and he could not

351
00:19:28.251 --> 00:19:33.020
demanding England to support Spain in acts of war on July, the 25th, 1554,

352
00:19:33.140 --> 00:19:37.010
the marriage of Mary and Phillip of England and Spain finally took place.

353
00:19:37.070 --> 00:19:39.980
It seems that from the start, the union was not a happy one.

354
00:19:40.130 --> 00:19:43.040
Phillip complains about the old age of Mary and Zack.

355
00:19:43.390 --> 00:19:48.320
Courtney has described her as not at all beautiful small and rather flabby and

356
00:19:48.440 --> 00:19:51.680
has no eyebrows for the showed little affection for his bride,

357
00:19:51.681 --> 00:19:55.070
avoiding her most of the time. And yet in October of 1554,

358
00:19:55.071 --> 00:19:59.450
Mary announced a pregnancy in April of 1555. The queen moved to Hampton court,

359
00:19:59.600 --> 00:20:04.400
visibly pregnant and preparing for birth bumps the days and the weeks passed.

360
00:20:04.401 --> 00:20:05.660
And nothing happens.

361
00:20:05.750 --> 00:20:09.590
Members of Mary's household began noticing that belly was becoming flatter.

362
00:20:09.591 --> 00:20:12.560
Again, eventually Mary and a doctors had to admit the truth.

363
00:20:12.590 --> 00:20:16.070
They'd all been mistaken and the queen had never actually been pregnant.

364
00:20:16.130 --> 00:20:20.450
So how was this possible after all she had displayed all the signs of pregnancy,

365
00:20:20.451 --> 00:20:22.070
including the ceasing of a periods,

366
00:20:22.071 --> 00:20:24.890
as well as swollen stomach and a discharge of milk.

367
00:20:24.950 --> 00:20:27.650
It may be that Mary self from amenorrhea rare condition,

368
00:20:27.680 --> 00:20:31.580
which causes painful and irregular periods and swelling of the abdomen and the

369
00:20:31.581 --> 00:20:35.210
breasts of the hypotheses include a disorder of the pituitary glands,

370
00:20:35.930 --> 00:20:38.560
uterine cancer, or even a Phantom pregnancy,

371
00:20:38.570 --> 00:20:42.860
a deep rooted belief of expecting a child which generated psychosomatic

372
00:20:42.861 --> 00:20:43.694
symptoms,

373
00:20:43.760 --> 00:20:47.830
whatever the underlying cause by August all symptoms had subsided and Mary left

374
00:20:47.831 --> 00:20:49.360
Hampton court as quietly as possible.

375
00:20:56.040 --> 00:20:56.280
<v 3>[Inaudible].</v>

376
00:20:56.280 --> 00:20:58.830
<v 0>While Mary was coping with her apparent pregnancy,</v>

377
00:20:58.950 --> 00:21:02.670
one of our most trusted counselors was harder work on religious matters.

378
00:21:02.730 --> 00:21:06.510
This was the new Archbishop of Canterbury carves and old original poles.

379
00:21:06.570 --> 00:21:11.190
Son of Mary's format lady in waiting Cosmo poll oversaw Mary's counter

380
00:21:11.191 --> 00:21:15.600
reformation, which culminated on November the 25th, 1554 on that date,

381
00:21:15.630 --> 00:21:19.830
parliament repealed Henry the eighth act of supremacy and effectively reinstated

382
00:21:19.831 --> 00:21:22.860
the Catholic faith in England. Three weeks later, Poland,

383
00:21:22.861 --> 00:21:25.680
the parliament revived the medieval Harrison rules.

384
00:21:25.710 --> 00:21:26.970
These grounds into the bishops,

385
00:21:26.971 --> 00:21:31.890
the right to identify heresy suspects and the mover to secular authorities for

386
00:21:31.891 --> 00:21:33.030
trial torture.

387
00:21:33.090 --> 00:21:36.750
And it's very often execution by burning at the stake with the legal framework

388
00:21:36.751 --> 00:21:37.201
in place.

389
00:21:37.201 --> 00:21:41.610
Mary urged the authorities to be diligence in seeking out heresy and punishing

390
00:21:41.611 --> 00:21:45.600
it with death. The first executions took place in February of 50 55.

391
00:21:45.780 --> 00:21:48.960
Initially the flames consumed the bodies of Protestant clergyman,

392
00:21:48.961 --> 00:21:51.330
such as John Hooper, Bishop of Gloucester,

393
00:21:51.660 --> 00:21:55.560
the execution as a place to bag of gunpowder around his neck to accelerate

394
00:21:55.561 --> 00:21:58.800
combustion as bad as it sounds. This was an active, messy,

395
00:21:58.860 --> 00:22:03.090
but the gunpowder failed to ignite and the Bishop's agony lost into 45 minutes.

396
00:22:03.180 --> 00:22:05.310
More high ranking clergymen followed Hooper's fate,

397
00:22:05.311 --> 00:22:06.780
including Archbishop Thomas cram,

398
00:22:06.960 --> 00:22:09.690
that he had led the Protestant reformation under Edward the sixth,

399
00:22:09.720 --> 00:22:11.550
but had later denied his beliefs.

400
00:22:11.551 --> 00:22:14.880
When Mary had ascended to the throne on the day of his execution, crammed up,

401
00:22:14.881 --> 00:22:19.290
plunged his hand into the flames, his self punishment for his Audi recantation.

402
00:22:19.410 --> 00:22:22.620
Besides these high-profile martyrs, most victims were commoners,

403
00:22:22.640 --> 00:22:23.940
poor traders and laborers.

404
00:22:24.060 --> 00:22:27.450
Some of them had been reported as heretic simply for not being able to recite

405
00:22:27.451 --> 00:22:30.090
the launch prep. In one particularly horrific execution,

406
00:22:30.091 --> 00:22:34.050
a pregnant woman was tied to the stake as their body was consumed by flames.

407
00:22:34.200 --> 00:22:38.520
She gave birth to a child who was tossed to onto the raging fire.

408
00:22:38.640 --> 00:22:43.410
So what happens in Mary? She started a rain as a fair and compassionate ruler.

409
00:22:43.650 --> 00:22:46.890
She had executed Dudley white and just acolytes. Sure,

410
00:22:46.891 --> 00:22:49.830
but that was the standard punishment for honey treason.

411
00:22:49.920 --> 00:22:53.520
It has been argued that Mary believed she was fulfilling a destiny by restoring

412
00:22:53.910 --> 00:22:57.540
England to the true faith, to save her subjects from the eternal flames of hell.

413
00:22:57.541 --> 00:22:59.940
She believed it was an acceptable price to pay.

414
00:23:00.210 --> 00:23:01.650
If some of them died at the stake,

415
00:23:01.680 --> 00:23:05.630
the Marion persecutions caused the death of about 300 English subjects.

416
00:23:05.631 --> 00:23:06.720
Since eventually,

417
00:23:07.110 --> 00:23:11.030
while they back font Mary's blood test cause many law subjects to turn away from

418
00:23:11.310 --> 00:23:13.440
Aaron Catholicism, by the end of 50 and 55,

419
00:23:13.441 --> 00:23:18.180
Mary realized that her actions that only succeeded in expanding the cohorts of

420
00:23:18.270 --> 00:23:21.120
her enemies, how has it been by the way was no longer by our side,

421
00:23:21.210 --> 00:23:23.100
after the revelation of a false pregnancy,

422
00:23:23.220 --> 00:23:26.850
he had relocated to the Netherlands where he enjoyed a life of jousting and

423
00:23:26.851 --> 00:23:28.920
womanizing in awesome. 1556.

424
00:23:28.921 --> 00:23:32.280
The queen found out that Phillip would be returning and she was delighted,

425
00:23:32.400 --> 00:23:35.310
but Phillip's return was not for the sake of a family reunion.

426
00:23:35.340 --> 00:23:37.770
The man even brought his mistress to London.

427
00:23:37.980 --> 00:23:42.000
I'll know Phillip was now King of Spain and was planning a war with France and

428
00:23:42.030 --> 00:23:46.310
needed England support King Phillip arrived in March of 1557 and married,

429
00:23:46.370 --> 00:23:48.830
anxious to please her husband succumbs to his pressure.

430
00:23:48.860 --> 00:23:50.450
Despite the council's protests.

431
00:23:50.720 --> 00:23:54.230
She promised English support for his war with France Phillip's campaign in

432
00:23:54.231 --> 00:23:58.400
France was short and successful in August. He captured San Quinn's intaking,

433
00:23:58.401 --> 00:24:00.290
many French Aras to Kratz as hostages.

434
00:24:00.650 --> 00:24:03.680
Phillip scored other minor victories until French King Henry the second Zoot for

435
00:24:03.681 --> 00:24:04.070
peace.

436
00:24:04.070 --> 00:24:08.330
And I'll tell you the 1557 Phillip left France and disbanded his Anglo Spanish

437
00:24:08.360 --> 00:24:11.090
forces, but Henry was already plotting revenge.

438
00:24:11.300 --> 00:24:15.950
This targets was Kalai jewel of the English crown on French lands in

439
00:24:15.951 --> 00:24:20.060
December the French attacks approaching over the frozen Marsha's Henry soldiers

440
00:24:20.061 --> 00:24:24.080
laid siege. The city Mary responded by dispatching a fleet from Dover,

441
00:24:24.110 --> 00:24:27.500
but the ships arrived too late by the 13th of January, 1558,

442
00:24:27.501 --> 00:24:31.250
French artillery had breached the walls of Carly and the city had fallen.

443
00:24:31.310 --> 00:24:33.440
Guinean ham were conquered by Henry.

444
00:24:33.830 --> 00:24:35.840
Mary had lost all of England's holdings in France,

445
00:24:36.590 --> 00:24:40.280
lost foothold on the continent. The fall of KLA was a devastating blow for Mary,

446
00:24:40.281 --> 00:24:43.970
but it was somewhat softened by the realization that she was pregnant.

447
00:24:44.060 --> 00:24:48.770
She waited until December of 1558 to notify Philip reassuring him that this time

448
00:24:48.771 --> 00:24:53.390
it was for real, except, but it wasn't. The baby was due in March, but by may,

449
00:24:53.420 --> 00:24:54.590
no child had been born.

450
00:24:54.680 --> 00:24:58.880
It appeared that Mary's distended belly was the sign of a fatal case of dropsy.

451
00:24:58.881 --> 00:25:01.130
The accumulation of fluid under the skin,

452
00:25:01.131 --> 00:25:05.480
which may lead to kidney failure in June. The queen became feverish by August.

453
00:25:05.510 --> 00:25:08.670
Her doctors predicted that death was inevitable. Queen Mary to,

454
00:25:08.930 --> 00:25:11.660
to finally died on the morning of November, the 17th,

455
00:25:11.690 --> 00:25:15.470
1558 at the age of 42 shortly before her death,

456
00:25:15.800 --> 00:25:18.950
she made the prediction that those who opened our body would find the words

457
00:25:19.310 --> 00:25:24.050
Phillip and Kalay carved onto our heart. During her short five-year reign,

458
00:25:24.051 --> 00:25:27.110
Mary Tudor was beset with personal and political disappointments.

459
00:25:27.111 --> 00:25:30.830
Well summarized by the two words, supposedly inscribed on our heart.

460
00:25:30.980 --> 00:25:32.930
She did initiate some important reforms,

461
00:25:32.931 --> 00:25:36.530
which set the stage for a stronger England to become a sea power,

462
00:25:36.590 --> 00:25:40.850
the skill bend resilience she displayed before becoming queen a remarkable.

463
00:25:40.910 --> 00:25:42.500
It is undeniable. Nonetheless,

464
00:25:42.501 --> 00:25:47.180
that the persecutions Mary instigated are one of the darkest pages in English

465
00:25:47.181 --> 00:25:47.660
history.

466
00:25:47.660 --> 00:25:51.620
Mary is remembered for an unjust and unjustified repression of religious

467
00:25:51.621 --> 00:25:54.560
expression, which eventually turned against us yet.

468
00:25:54.650 --> 00:25:58.700
A certain queen who came after her had 640 people executed

469
00:25:58.970 --> 00:26:01.160
190 of them for religious reasons.

470
00:26:01.190 --> 00:26:04.790
But we remember her as Gloriana and just as increased SETA King,

471
00:26:04.820 --> 00:26:08.420
who came before her ordered 2000 prisoners beheaded in the Holy land,

472
00:26:08.421 --> 00:26:11.390
simply because he grew impatient with negotiations,

473
00:26:11.420 --> 00:26:13.760
but we remember him as lawn hos.

474
00:26:13.820 --> 00:26:17.090
I'm not suggesting that Mary's reign should never be remembered as bloody,

475
00:26:17.180 --> 00:26:19.250
but is it fair to single her out as such?

476
00:26:19.251 --> 00:26:21.800
Or would it be fair to reassess our legacy?

477
00:26:22.010 --> 00:26:25.430
I'm looking forward to hearing your verdicts in the comments and as usual,

478
00:26:25.460 --> 00:26:27.230
thank you for watching. Please do check it off.
