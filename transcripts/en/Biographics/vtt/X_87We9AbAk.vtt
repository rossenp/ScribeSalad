00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:01.170
<v 0>Just before we get started,</v>

2
00:00:01.171 --> 00:00:04.020
some of you might know that I have another channel called mega projects,

3
00:00:04.021 --> 00:00:07.320
which is all about mega projects. If you don't know about that,

4
00:00:07.321 --> 00:00:10.170
please do subscribe to it. Well, by popular demands,

5
00:00:10.180 --> 00:00:13.890
I wanted to cover some things on that channel. The one quite mega enough for it.

6
00:00:13.891 --> 00:00:17.490
So I presented to you a brand new channel side projects,

7
00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:21.660
cover stuff like secrets, Soviet space weapons, world war two is greatest liens.

8
00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:25.920
History is the lost treasures and the movements of London bridge from London to

9
00:00:25.921 --> 00:00:29.640
a random town in America. Stuff likes that new videos every week.

10
00:00:29.641 --> 00:00:34.050
So if you were thinking, boy, Simon doesn't make enough content for me. Well,

11
00:00:34.051 --> 00:00:36.270
good news for you subscribed to that channel.

12
00:00:36.271 --> 00:00:39.270
There is a link below and let's get into it.

13
00:00:39.810 --> 00:00:44.340
North Korea is a nation that list its size and kinds of reaction from the worlds

14
00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:47.520
and not always the positive GYNs the country. We know these days,

15
00:00:47.521 --> 00:00:50.490
at least from the global news perspective is one that is fraught with

16
00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:53.100
controversy is dictatorship of the highest order.

17
00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:54.720
This of course ignores the Marianne.

18
00:00:54.800 --> 00:00:58.110
It's a beautiful things that North Korea has to offer through its culture, food,

19
00:00:58.111 --> 00:01:01.530
music, and social graces. And as the constant spectra of the current leader,

20
00:01:01.531 --> 00:01:04.470
Kim Jong-un stirring the pot doesn't help matters. His father,

21
00:01:04.471 --> 00:01:07.830
Kim Jong-il was also an expert to keeping world leaders on their toes.

22
00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:10.830
But before all of that, there was the founder of North Korea,

23
00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:13.050
Kim Il-sung from the ashes of world war two.

24
00:01:13.051 --> 00:01:16.890
He founded the country in 1948 with the help of the Soviet union during his

25
00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:19.620
reign, the country of North Korea prospered. And to this day,

26
00:01:19.621 --> 00:01:22.950
the shadow of Kim Il-sung looms large over the nation.

27
00:01:23.160 --> 00:01:26.130
Long after his death occurred in 1994,

28
00:01:26.190 --> 00:01:29.310
the Coulter personality that was propagated around him is still strong.

29
00:01:29.311 --> 00:01:32.190
And he is known as the eternal president of the Republic.

30
00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:36.930
Entire new calendars were created based around when he was sent from

31
00:01:36.931 --> 00:01:37.770
heaven. Today,

32
00:01:37.771 --> 00:01:41.760
we will discuss the legacy of the man who birthed the nation of North Korea.

33
00:01:42.120 --> 00:01:42.953
Kim Il-sung

34
00:01:55.640 --> 00:01:59.900
Wilson was born Kim song Jew on April the 15th, 1912, the same day,

35
00:01:59.901 --> 00:02:03.800
the Titanic tragic leap plunged into the depths of the Atlantic ocean though.

36
00:02:04.010 --> 00:02:06.530
His exact place of birth has been under scrutiny.

37
00:02:06.590 --> 00:02:10.010
We know that he was raised somewhere near the current capital of present day,

38
00:02:10.011 --> 00:02:13.700
North Korea, Pyongyang. His parents lived a modest life while raising,

39
00:02:13.701 --> 00:02:17.240
given his two brothers and tried to introduce religion into their lives with

40
00:02:17.420 --> 00:02:20.660
several of his family members being involved in the Presbyterian, faith,

41
00:02:20.840 --> 00:02:23.930
the faith of the family, wasn't just relegated to the church.

42
00:02:23.960 --> 00:02:27.890
They also held the fervent belief that the Japanese occupation of Korea was

43
00:02:27.891 --> 00:02:29.180
wrong and unjust.

44
00:02:29.420 --> 00:02:33.320
Japan had been taking over the Korean peninsula two years before Kim was born

45
00:02:33.321 --> 00:02:36.410
and his family outwardly and publicly protested.

46
00:02:36.411 --> 00:02:40.370
The act Japan's response to the Korean uprising was Swift and measured with over

47
00:02:40.371 --> 00:02:44.180
50,000 arrests of Korean citizens in Kim's birth year,

48
00:02:44.240 --> 00:02:47.780
Japan effectively ruled the country from 1910 until the end of world war II in

49
00:02:47.781 --> 00:02:50.390
1945. And countless families were displaced.

50
00:02:50.450 --> 00:02:54.020
Kim and his family were included in this displacement and Kim himself would not

51
00:02:54.021 --> 00:02:56.630
return to his home country until Japan surrendered.

52
00:02:56.631 --> 00:02:59.920
At the conclusion of the war Kim's father was a physician, a teacher,

53
00:02:59.921 --> 00:03:03.550
and held a certain power over the young boy showing him just how badly

54
00:03:04.150 --> 00:03:07.300
imperialists Japan needed to be brought down in his autobiography.

55
00:03:07.301 --> 00:03:10.540
Kim recalled being five years old, playing on a swing with his mother,

56
00:03:10.541 --> 00:03:14.800
cradling him and already steadfast and as well to defeat the evil forces of

57
00:03:14.801 --> 00:03:18.790
Japan. When he was six, he was already joining ranks of protesters in the March.

58
00:03:18.791 --> 00:03:19.571
The first two movements,

59
00:03:19.571 --> 00:03:23.410
one of the largest public protests in Korea against their occupied Japan,

60
00:03:23.470 --> 00:03:25.480
absolutely annihilated the rebellion,

61
00:03:25.481 --> 00:03:29.110
but can at least according to his own accounts was right there in the middle of

62
00:03:29.111 --> 00:03:32.500
the fray later recalling. When the adults cheered for independence,

63
00:03:32.530 --> 00:03:35.170
I joined them. The enemy used swords and guns.

64
00:03:36.010 --> 00:03:36.940
Indiscriminantly against the masses.

65
00:03:37.210 --> 00:03:40.780
This was the day I witnessed Korean blood being spilled for the first time.

66
00:03:41.050 --> 00:03:43.240
My young heart burned with indignation.

67
00:03:43.360 --> 00:03:46.690
Since there isn't much in the way of concrete details of this part of Kimmel

68
00:03:47.010 --> 00:03:50.830
Il-sung childhood, much of what we think we know is from his autobiography,

69
00:03:50.831 --> 00:03:52.630
which she certainly embellished.

70
00:03:52.660 --> 00:03:56.800
He spun tales of being a young boy in teen and laying spike strips across the

71
00:03:56.801 --> 00:03:58.900
road to take out Japanese police vehicles.

72
00:03:58.901 --> 00:04:00.940
But the crystallization of his suppose,

73
00:04:00.941 --> 00:04:05.440
a destiny to take his country back seems to have happened at age 14 when his

74
00:04:05.441 --> 00:04:09.280
father passed away while the family was an exile in Manchuria, before he died,

75
00:04:09.281 --> 00:04:10.300
he told his eager son,

76
00:04:10.570 --> 00:04:14.380
you must not forget that you belong to the country and the people you must win

77
00:04:14.381 --> 00:04:16.270
back your country at all costs.

78
00:04:16.271 --> 00:04:20.380
Even if your bones are broken and your bodies are torn apart,

79
00:04:20.500 --> 00:04:22.690
Kim Wilson was still just an awkward teenager,

80
00:04:22.720 --> 00:04:26.860
but his upcoming school studies and UN middle school and Manchuria would prepare

81
00:04:26.861 --> 00:04:30.490
him with the kind of revolutionary thought that would guide him through his

82
00:04:30.491 --> 00:04:34.180
formative years until then he founded the down with imperialism union,

83
00:04:34.181 --> 00:04:36.730
which is what exactly what it sounds like.

84
00:04:36.880 --> 00:04:39.430
He also attended the was soon military Academy,

85
00:04:39.431 --> 00:04:41.530
but was quickly unimpressed by their methods.

86
00:04:41.620 --> 00:04:44.950
Something you don't usually expect from a 14 year old boy,

87
00:04:45.010 --> 00:04:47.740
he lasted one year at the Academy in total. Why don't you?

88
00:04:47.860 --> 00:04:52.120
And middle-school Kim began to lean towards communist ideals rejecting the more

89
00:04:52.121 --> 00:04:55.990
traditional feudal views held by the older folks and adopting a more

90
00:04:56.020 --> 00:04:57.130
self-reliant outlook.

91
00:04:57.190 --> 00:05:01.360
He took parts in forming an underground Marxist group at the age of 17 and acts

92
00:05:01.570 --> 00:05:03.280
that ends in a short stint in jail.

93
00:05:03.281 --> 00:05:06.970
When the police found out and an abrupt end to his education,

94
00:05:07.030 --> 00:05:08.290
these small acts of aggression,

95
00:05:08.320 --> 00:05:13.210
which is preparing him to formally join the communist party in China in 1931,

96
00:05:20.160 --> 00:05:24.480
Resentment towards the Japanese whom he blamed for being exiled from his own

97
00:05:24.481 --> 00:05:25.410
country of Korea.

98
00:05:25.470 --> 00:05:28.440
Kim jumped at the chance to help out the communist party in a more official

99
00:05:28.441 --> 00:05:32.790
capacity after spending time scrapping with several ragtag guerrilla groups in

100
00:05:32.791 --> 00:05:35.310
China, when he called Manchuria his temporary home,

101
00:05:35.311 --> 00:05:38.310
the Japanese hadn't bothered the region much until 1930,

102
00:05:38.311 --> 00:05:40.380
when several violent skirmishes arose,

103
00:05:40.381 --> 00:05:42.660
which made it clear that the conflict was impending.

104
00:05:42.900 --> 00:05:45.540
Kim couldn't escape the Japanese, no matter where he turns,

105
00:05:45.600 --> 00:05:49.440
he saw his chance to step up and warns that a plan Japanese occupation of

106
00:05:49.441 --> 00:05:53.790
Manchuria was coming and a defining speech to the communist league in May, 1931,

107
00:05:53.910 --> 00:05:57.410
Kim galvanized all anti-Japanese allies at his disposal,

108
00:05:57.530 --> 00:06:01.580
detailed why previous uprisings had failed and basically predicted to the crowd

109
00:06:01.581 --> 00:06:03.470
exactly what would happen four months later,

110
00:06:03.710 --> 00:06:07.580
soon after the Japanese government used a minor attack on their railroads in

111
00:06:07.581 --> 00:06:11.840
Manchuria to send forces in and invade and install their own government.

112
00:06:11.900 --> 00:06:15.050
Kim was incensed. He joined yet another coalition,

113
00:06:15.051 --> 00:06:17.120
the Northeast anti Japanese United army.

114
00:06:17.330 --> 00:06:20.810
He took up arms and was given control of troops with the backing of the

115
00:06:20.811 --> 00:06:24.230
communist party of China. Kim led several hundred men. His battle ends.

116
00:06:24.320 --> 00:06:27.770
It ends the praise and tutelage of military higher ups with close ties to

117
00:06:27.980 --> 00:06:29.750
Chinese leader, Mao Zedong himself.

118
00:06:30.020 --> 00:06:34.310
This was the time Ken began to make himself larger than life and built his own

119
00:06:34.311 --> 00:06:37.850
legend. As he saw fit, he changed his name officially to Kim Il-sung,

120
00:06:37.880 --> 00:06:40.190
which translates to Kim, become the son,

121
00:06:40.250 --> 00:06:43.430
not exactly a law humble way to introduce yourself to the world.

122
00:06:43.460 --> 00:06:46.730
He became as brash as his name and took control of the sixth division of the

123
00:06:46.731 --> 00:06:50.540
United army. One bold attack on a Japanese downtown in June,

124
00:06:50.540 --> 00:06:54.410
1937 was particularly notable because it involved him and his troops capturing a

125
00:06:54.411 --> 00:06:57.890
city, Justin scientist's home country of Korea. It was a symbolic victory.

126
00:06:57.920 --> 00:07:01.370
One that laid bare his plans for his future and for the Korean people,

127
00:07:01.640 --> 00:07:03.800
he was coming home one way or another.

128
00:07:03.860 --> 00:07:06.920
The Japanese had begun taking notice of the young military leader too.

129
00:07:06.980 --> 00:07:10.280
They had wanted posters for his capture, labeling him for Tanya.

130
00:07:10.520 --> 00:07:15.020
He was actively hunted by special Japanese units during 1940 that year saw the

131
00:07:15.021 --> 00:07:17.000
world already embroiled in the second world war.

132
00:07:17.001 --> 00:07:20.060
So battle lines were already being drawn all the way around the globe.

133
00:07:20.330 --> 00:07:23.750
One place where Kim's efforts were appreciated was the Soviet union.

134
00:07:23.751 --> 00:07:25.880
And that country offered him a sort of refuge.

135
00:07:25.881 --> 00:07:29.600
When Japanese forces went off to him and allowed his regimen to be trained by

136
00:07:29.601 --> 00:07:33.740
Soviet forces and to even join the Soviet red army as a major and fought with

137
00:07:33.741 --> 00:07:36.470
them for the rest of the war. Kim was also beginning to grow his family.

138
00:07:36.471 --> 00:07:40.580
It was these years. So him and his wife, Kim Jong soak having three children,

139
00:07:40.640 --> 00:07:42.200
one of whom was Kim Jong IL,

140
00:07:42.201 --> 00:07:45.860
who would go on to start his own special brand of trouble. A little later,

141
00:07:53.170 --> 00:07:56.260
I have now spent the majority of his grown life fighting outside forces to be

142
00:07:56.261 --> 00:07:58.240
able to simply go back home.

143
00:07:58.300 --> 00:08:02.320
When the Soviet union probably declared war on Japan in 1945 and started their

144
00:08:02.470 --> 00:08:04.480
approach into the Korean city of Pyongyang.

145
00:08:04.900 --> 00:08:08.770
Kevin was afforded the chance to set foot back into his birth nation Soviet

146
00:08:08.771 --> 00:08:11.980
leader. Joseph Stalin instructed as leaders to occupy career rooms wanted

147
00:08:11.981 --> 00:08:15.670
recommendations on who could help install the temporary communist government.

148
00:08:15.671 --> 00:08:17.800
That Kim was the perfect candidate.

149
00:08:17.920 --> 00:08:20.170
After 26 years of being removed from his Homeland.

150
00:08:20.350 --> 00:08:23.500
Kim soon was elected the chairman of the North Korean communist party in

151
00:08:23.501 --> 00:08:27.970
December, 1945. That doesn't mean he was ready from day one, strangely enough.

152
00:08:27.971 --> 00:08:29.890
He had spent little time in his own country.

153
00:08:29.891 --> 00:08:32.770
So he didn't even know that much of the Korean language.

154
00:08:32.830 --> 00:08:36.130
You had to be coached for his own inaugural speech just days before it took

155
00:08:36.131 --> 00:08:38.650
place. Kim effectively ran the Northern part of Korea.

156
00:08:38.651 --> 00:08:40.690
As far as administrative rank goes, though,

157
00:08:40.870 --> 00:08:43.870
he still answered directly to the Soviets occupying his country,

158
00:08:43.871 --> 00:08:46.090
which meant that even though he was finally home,

159
00:08:46.330 --> 00:08:50.860
he was still under someone else's finger for the time being can also did launch

160
00:08:50.861 --> 00:08:54.640
the Korean people's army offshoot of the communist party and used his previous

161
00:08:54.641 --> 00:08:58.920
military and contacts for me, a formidable army and air force. Again,

162
00:08:58.950 --> 00:09:01.470
using that handy Soviet training and equipment.

163
00:09:01.530 --> 00:09:05.400
The strife between the North and South parts of Korea started not long after

164
00:09:05.401 --> 00:09:06.091
world war two,

165
00:09:06.091 --> 00:09:09.450
when the U S and Russia decided to cut the country in half the Soviets

166
00:09:09.960 --> 00:09:11.730
controlled the Northern regions and the Americans,

167
00:09:11.731 --> 00:09:16.290
the South and the ensuing cold war did nothing but add more tension within the

168
00:09:16.291 --> 00:09:17.220
Korean peninsula.

169
00:09:17.250 --> 00:09:20.850
The Soviet tells elections in 1948 for a true leader of the newly named

170
00:09:20.880 --> 00:09:25.200
democratic people's Republic of Korea, or as you know it, North Korea with Kim,

171
00:09:25.201 --> 00:09:26.950
Il-sung running the title of premiere,

172
00:09:27.090 --> 00:09:30.840
the South named simply Republic of Korea that their own leader and declared

173
00:09:30.841 --> 00:09:33.450
their own state. It give them quickly consolidated power,

174
00:09:33.451 --> 00:09:36.930
merging the communist party with other affiliations and organizations and

175
00:09:36.931 --> 00:09:39.900
morphing into something that resembled a bit more of a dictatorship.

176
00:09:39.930 --> 00:09:42.330
The power of Kim as an individual was quickly increasing,

177
00:09:42.331 --> 00:09:44.580
and he was already making bold moves in the North.

178
00:09:44.820 --> 00:09:48.090
He had statutes created and distributed around the country and began doubling

179
00:09:48.091 --> 00:09:52.080
himself great leader. The cult of personality was already on display.

180
00:09:52.200 --> 00:09:55.380
His policies were as audacious as his view of himself.

181
00:09:55.410 --> 00:09:59.400
He proclaims that half of all farmable lands should be redistributed in order

182
00:09:59.401 --> 00:10:01.380
for enough food to be produced for his people.

183
00:10:01.590 --> 00:10:05.730
It also gave him the added pleasure of taking back lands that were still held by

184
00:10:05.910 --> 00:10:06.930
many Japanese property.

185
00:10:06.931 --> 00:10:10.560
Owners can also introduce to Countrywide standard eight hour Workday,

186
00:10:10.561 --> 00:10:14.160
which was more like an overall guide as to how people should spend that day.

187
00:10:14.220 --> 00:10:17.460
Kimberly was in eight hours, work, eight hours rest and data was studied,

188
00:10:17.670 --> 00:10:19.680
can also introduce healthcare for all.

189
00:10:19.681 --> 00:10:23.250
And it was one of the best systems in all of Asia for quite some time for Ken

190
00:10:23.251 --> 00:10:26.280
may well-educated well arrested where I could put less of a burden on the

191
00:10:26.640 --> 00:10:28.080
healthcare system. More health equals.

192
00:10:28.310 --> 00:10:29.143
<v 2>Well production.</v>

193
00:10:34.970 --> 00:10:35.780
The border between.

194
00:10:35.780 --> 00:10:39.230
<v 0>North and South Korea was sat around 1948 at the 38th parallel though.</v>

195
00:10:39.380 --> 00:10:41.840
Neither country openly admitted that they were split at all.

196
00:10:42.080 --> 00:10:45.560
Obviously the Soviets who helps run the North and the Americans who occupied the

197
00:10:45.561 --> 00:10:49.340
South disagreed criminal sewing had no small part in deciding that reclaiming

198
00:10:49.341 --> 00:10:51.320
all of Korea was something that needed to be done.

199
00:10:51.860 --> 00:10:54.770
Starlin was armed with intelligence that the U S wouldn't intervene if such an

200
00:10:54.771 --> 00:10:55.700
invasion occurred.

201
00:10:55.701 --> 00:10:59.450
And Kim was made bolder by the fact that China would also assist.

202
00:10:59.451 --> 00:11:03.800
And so in 1950, Kim's North Korean army headed South and quickly took Seoul.

203
00:11:04.010 --> 00:11:05.210
The capital of South Korea.

204
00:11:05.390 --> 00:11:09.440
The South Saami were already on their heels and Kim's army began occupying most

205
00:11:09.441 --> 00:11:10.274
of their land,

206
00:11:10.310 --> 00:11:14.450
but that was when Stalin's information or lack thereof as soon proved false.

207
00:11:14.451 --> 00:11:17.240
As the United States have blown with the United nations,

208
00:11:17.600 --> 00:11:19.280
absolutely began to intervene.

209
00:11:19.490 --> 00:11:23.600
Then U S president Truman received word almost instantly of the North Koreans

210
00:11:23.601 --> 00:11:24.530
transgression,

211
00:11:24.560 --> 00:11:28.790
and even compared the act stupidness sweep across Europe in the 1930s,

212
00:11:29.090 --> 00:11:30.740
then got the ball rolling for the Americans,

213
00:11:30.741 --> 00:11:33.890
do throw their hat into the war ringings for the next three years,

214
00:11:33.891 --> 00:11:35.380
Kim and his country teat,

215
00:11:35.740 --> 00:11:39.380
dotted back and forth between advancing in the conflict and subsequently having

216
00:11:39.381 --> 00:11:43.010
to retreat Kevin's prions taking of the city of Seoul was thoughted several

217
00:11:43.011 --> 00:11:46.460
times the help from Chinese forces bailed them out more than once,

218
00:11:46.461 --> 00:11:51.140
but even still Kim's capital of Pyongyang was overrun by United nations

219
00:11:51.141 --> 00:11:53.000
armies buying September, 1950.

220
00:11:53.500 --> 00:11:56.530
You have to flee to the Northern reaches of his own country in a kind of

221
00:11:56.710 --> 00:12:00.730
metaphor for his entire life. China again, came to the rescue.

222
00:12:00.731 --> 00:12:03.970
The next year in Pyongyang was restored to team. North Korea can,

223
00:12:03.971 --> 00:12:07.720
would face these kinds of shallow victories and defeats for the next two years

224
00:12:07.721 --> 00:12:11.950
until the war ended in 1953 at a cost of over two and a half million lives.

225
00:12:12.220 --> 00:12:16.060
Kim was resentful of the Chinese getting all the glory in the war while the

226
00:12:16.061 --> 00:12:20.680
North Korean armies were relegated to the sidelines for a lot of the skirmishes.

227
00:12:20.740 --> 00:12:23.200
Kim also saw his grand prospect of reuniting.

228
00:12:23.201 --> 00:12:26.650
The entire Korean peninsula is one country slipping through his fingers,

229
00:12:26.651 --> 00:12:30.880
and increasingly forced to have a truce forms later in the war that didn't stop

230
00:12:30.881 --> 00:12:34.000
him from claiming victory immediately after the war ended. However,

231
00:12:34.001 --> 00:12:38.020
and it didn't stop his people and country folk from holding that legend in there.

232
00:12:44.790 --> 00:12:44.970
<v 2>[Inaudible].</v>

233
00:12:44.970 --> 00:12:46.380
<v 0>Displays Kim Il-sung touting.</v>

234
00:12:46.381 --> 00:12:50.490
The ends of the Korean war is a victory for the North is off of the country was

235
00:12:50.491 --> 00:12:54.390
in tatters. Sure. He was still in power as the leader of North Korea,

236
00:12:54.420 --> 00:12:56.520
but it was economy and people were decimated.

237
00:12:56.521 --> 00:13:00.090
So while he did what he was good at, he consolidated power.

238
00:13:00.180 --> 00:13:03.810
He had the country take over industry completely with an especially heavy focus

239
00:13:03.811 --> 00:13:05.910
on arms production and military expansion.

240
00:13:06.000 --> 00:13:08.250
And it worked for a time as the 1950s,

241
00:13:08.251 --> 00:13:12.180
continued as country was actually doing better in many ways than South Korea,

242
00:13:12.181 --> 00:13:16.350
where the U S still remained and whose economy was incredibly unstable,

243
00:13:16.410 --> 00:13:20.010
can married for the second time. In 1952 to Kim song,

244
00:13:20.040 --> 00:13:24.960
a whom many thought that Kim Il-sung had been seeing secretly before his first

245
00:13:24.961 --> 00:13:26.610
wife even passed away with her.

246
00:13:26.611 --> 00:13:29.850
He has two more sons and a daughter in a different approach than he usually

247
00:13:30.210 --> 00:13:30.240
allowed.

248
00:13:30.240 --> 00:13:33.960
Kim gave his wife a considerable amount of power in North Korean politics.

249
00:13:33.990 --> 00:13:36.090
Kim himself remains a bastion of communism,

250
00:13:36.091 --> 00:13:38.490
touting its benefits on the international stage.

251
00:13:38.610 --> 00:13:42.000
He sided with Chinese communist leader mountain and began reading his own

252
00:13:42.001 --> 00:13:44.130
country of those who did not follow his beliefs.

253
00:13:44.220 --> 00:13:48.600
Allies quickly became enemies pack on young was a close confidant of Kim's

254
00:13:48.601 --> 00:13:52.320
during the Korean war and was high in the ranks of the Korean worker's party,

255
00:13:52.321 --> 00:13:54.540
the dominant political party in North Korea.

256
00:13:54.630 --> 00:13:58.530
He Rose to the title of foreign minister, which he held from 1948 to 1953.

257
00:13:58.560 --> 00:14:00.540
Once the war was over and Soviet leader,

258
00:14:00.541 --> 00:14:05.430
Joseph Stalin died relationship soured between Ken and PAC Kim sought to

259
00:14:05.580 --> 00:14:09.540
get rid of those who still had allegiances to the Soviet union and China and

260
00:14:09.750 --> 00:14:14.010
make the regime has entirely allegations of PAC spying for the United States

261
00:14:14.011 --> 00:14:17.250
against North Korea were fabricated. And finally in 1955,

262
00:14:17.430 --> 00:14:20.370
Kim had him executed against the Soviets wishes, the path to Kim,

263
00:14:20.371 --> 00:14:22.320
trying to establish his own independence,

264
00:14:22.380 --> 00:14:26.670
upset the Soviets and the Chinese Kim Olson was brought to Moscow for six weeks

265
00:14:26.671 --> 00:14:30.480
in the summer of 1956 to receive a stern warning regarding him falling out of

266
00:14:30.481 --> 00:14:34.530
line with the Soviets ideas for how North Korea should be run during that time,

267
00:14:34.531 --> 00:14:38.520
Korean communist groups and pro Soviet factions in North Korea fans,

268
00:14:38.580 --> 00:14:40.410
how to confront him upon his return.

269
00:14:40.500 --> 00:14:43.440
They obviously had to attack him during his next big assembly speech during

270
00:14:43.441 --> 00:14:47.190
which they brought up his methods of perjuring high ranking officials and

271
00:14:47.191 --> 00:14:48.024
executing them,

272
00:14:48.090 --> 00:14:52.130
causing starvation and famine among these people by hyper-focusing on

273
00:14:52.131 --> 00:14:53.390
industrialization.

274
00:14:53.540 --> 00:14:56.990
And for trying to consolidate too much power in his own hands.

275
00:14:57.110 --> 00:15:01.850
It was called the August faction and obvious attempt to overthrow chem and it

276
00:15:01.851 --> 00:15:02.510
failed.

277
00:15:02.510 --> 00:15:07.340
He began brutally going after all pro Chinese and pro-Soviet people and any kind

278
00:15:07.341 --> 00:15:08.390
of power in this country,

279
00:15:08.420 --> 00:15:12.440
they began to flee back to their respective countries rather than be rounded up

280
00:15:12.441 --> 00:15:16.030
in prison or executed. There was almost no one left to question again,

281
00:15:16.160 --> 00:15:17.090
then it's by 1958,

282
00:15:17.091 --> 00:15:21.020
North Korea was fully independent with no debts left to China or the Soviet

283
00:15:21.021 --> 00:15:24.920
union. Kim started to unfurl his newfound power in astounding ways.

284
00:15:25.130 --> 00:15:28.430
He initiated a massive system in which its citizens were classified.

285
00:15:28.640 --> 00:15:31.160
It was called the song Bon cost system,

286
00:15:31.161 --> 00:15:33.830
and it categorized a person and do three different groups,

287
00:15:33.831 --> 00:15:36.530
which were core wavering and hostile.

288
00:15:36.560 --> 00:15:39.950
Much of this information was derived from that person's personal history and

289
00:15:40.130 --> 00:15:43.940
which group they fit into directly impacted what kind of social benefits they

290
00:15:43.941 --> 00:15:47.210
would receive. This included where they would be allowed to own a home,

291
00:15:47.211 --> 00:15:50.870
which schools they could attend and even how much food they would be allotted.

292
00:15:51.110 --> 00:15:54.350
If a poor unfortunate soul happened to be included in the hostile class,

293
00:15:54.380 --> 00:15:55.610
they would be ostracized.

294
00:15:55.611 --> 00:15:59.570
And often forcibly moved to remote areas of the country or hostile.

295
00:15:59.571 --> 00:16:01.130
Wouldn't be alone in this trip though.

296
00:16:01.280 --> 00:16:05.030
Often their entire families would be sent packing with them regardless of their

297
00:16:05.031 --> 00:16:07.190
political affiliations or past histories.

298
00:16:07.370 --> 00:16:09.830
There were untold numbers of forced labor camps called Kwan.

299
00:16:09.831 --> 00:16:14.120
Liso where political prisoners and other national dissenters were often in turn

300
00:16:14.121 --> 00:16:15.080
for their entire lives.

301
00:16:15.110 --> 00:16:19.250
Suffice it to say the conditions in these camps were horns with countless tales

302
00:16:19.251 --> 00:16:23.120
of sexual abuse, torture and starvation. Kim Il-sung banished,

303
00:16:23.150 --> 00:16:25.730
all sorts of real and perceived enemies to a fate,

304
00:16:25.760 --> 00:16:30.710
almost worse than death and wielded an immense power that only enhanced his

305
00:16:30.711 --> 00:16:31.580
cult of personality.

306
00:16:38.350 --> 00:16:38.800
<v 1>[Inaudible].</v>

307
00:16:38.800 --> 00:16:41.560
<v 0>[Inaudible] made it a point to stay close with other communist countries like</v>

308
00:16:41.561 --> 00:16:43.240
Romania in East Germany. And so,

309
00:16:43.420 --> 00:16:45.670
although he had some frayed relations with the Soviet union,

310
00:16:45.671 --> 00:16:47.290
he began to rebuild trust with them.

311
00:16:47.291 --> 00:16:50.230
As Israel extended into the 1960s and seventies,

312
00:16:50.440 --> 00:16:52.870
the sixties saw him and his North Vietnamese leader,

313
00:16:53.290 --> 00:16:55.570
hoochie men's developer mutual respect for each other.

314
00:16:55.630 --> 00:16:59.380
Kim saw how hokey men tried to bring North and South Vietnam together.

315
00:16:59.650 --> 00:17:03.040
And it echoed the way Kim, it attempted to do the same thing with his country.

316
00:17:03.070 --> 00:17:07.870
The ensuing war in Vietnam would bring the two men even closer in 1965 can

317
00:17:08.140 --> 00:17:10.990
begin sending military and financial assets to North Vietnam.

318
00:17:11.170 --> 00:17:13.090
His fighting began to take over the country.

319
00:17:13.150 --> 00:17:16.270
Kim saw potential in the communist leader who she men and each years,

320
00:17:16.280 --> 00:17:20.230
or millions more in financial backing for North Vietnam, as well as uniforms,

321
00:17:20.320 --> 00:17:21.490
training, and military,

322
00:17:21.670 --> 00:17:26.260
as support Kim told his brief pilots to fight in the war as if the Vietnamese

323
00:17:26.261 --> 00:17:28.780
sky with our own. And to show you this,

324
00:17:29.110 --> 00:17:31.390
it wasn't just offering help to military personnel.

325
00:17:31.510 --> 00:17:34.510
North Vietnamese students were given free education in North Korea.

326
00:17:34.570 --> 00:17:38.440
Kim was trying to build a long-term relationship, but it was fleeting.

327
00:17:38.560 --> 00:17:42.400
Once North Vietnam started to look for an end to the walk in the Gans day issue.

328
00:17:42.580 --> 00:17:45.880
The United States was now completely wrapped up in Vietnam's warrant.

329
00:17:46.030 --> 00:17:49.890
Kim wanted to make sure they stayed that the more attention they gave Vietnam,

330
00:17:49.891 --> 00:17:51.450
the less North Korea received.

331
00:17:51.570 --> 00:17:55.890
It was an extra slap in the face when the war ended in 1975 and North and South

332
00:17:55.891 --> 00:17:59.850
Vietnam actually unified where the careers had failed to do so.

333
00:18:00.000 --> 00:18:03.750
The rest of the 1970s Sorkin began to look to its success. Though.

334
00:18:03.870 --> 00:18:07.590
We oversaw a new constitution drafted for North Korea in 1972,

335
00:18:07.591 --> 00:18:10.830
and it changed his title from premier to presidents.

336
00:18:10.980 --> 00:18:13.950
He started to realize he was approaching the end of his reign.

337
00:18:14.100 --> 00:18:15.960
North Korea was struggling economically.

338
00:18:15.961 --> 00:18:20.100
While South Korea was boosted by American money and was prospering North Korea.

339
00:18:20.101 --> 00:18:23.370
His practice of [inaudible], which was a method of extreme self-reliance.

340
00:18:23.371 --> 00:18:26.640
It was coming back to bite them as they deliberately alienated themselves from

341
00:18:26.641 --> 00:18:27.480
the rest of the world.

342
00:18:27.570 --> 00:18:30.330
Kim also began to develop a launch tumor on the back of his neck,

343
00:18:30.480 --> 00:18:34.110
something he was self-conscious about to the point of making photographers,

344
00:18:34.111 --> 00:18:36.180
shoot him from his more flattering site.

345
00:18:36.300 --> 00:18:38.940
The time had come to think about the future of his country.

346
00:18:38.941 --> 00:18:43.560
And so at an assembly in 1980, he named his son, Kim Jong-il as successor.

347
00:18:43.600 --> 00:18:47.100
Once he was gone, it wasn't exactly setting his son up for success. However,

348
00:18:47.160 --> 00:18:50.220
former allies weren't interested in helping North Korea, his economy,

349
00:18:50.280 --> 00:18:53.730
China had reformed the points where North Korea didn't have anything to offer

350
00:18:53.731 --> 00:18:56.910
them financially. It also befriended South Korea.

351
00:18:56.970 --> 00:19:00.510
The Soviet union would teach her and then completely implode and revolution

352
00:19:00.511 --> 00:19:02.370
during the late eighties and early nineties,

353
00:19:02.550 --> 00:19:07.410
North Korea was an Island of its own making Kim Il-sung seem to tire of

354
00:19:07.411 --> 00:19:10.350
being on that Island at some point during the 1990s. However,

355
00:19:10.590 --> 00:19:13.770
when North Korea began to embark on their own nuclear program,

356
00:19:13.771 --> 00:19:15.450
former us president, Jimmy Carter,

357
00:19:15.480 --> 00:19:19.440
traveled to North Korea to try and talk him down from such a hostile endeavor.

358
00:19:19.530 --> 00:19:22.590
Amazingly Kim agreed to put a stop to the program and his new openness to

359
00:19:22.591 --> 00:19:26.520
negotiation seemed to be a step in the right direction to getting North Korea,

360
00:19:26.521 --> 00:19:28.320
to be a part of the world's neighborhood,

361
00:19:28.800 --> 00:19:31.410
but it wouldn't lost on July the eighth, 1994,

362
00:19:31.620 --> 00:19:33.690
Kim suffered a heart attack at his home in Pyongyang.

363
00:19:33.720 --> 00:19:37.710
Kim Jong-il tried to summon the best doctors North Korea had to his father's

364
00:19:37.711 --> 00:19:41.820
side, but it was for naught and Kimmel's son passed away at the age of 82,

365
00:19:42.000 --> 00:19:45.390
a 10 day mourning period was instituted around the country and his body was

366
00:19:45.391 --> 00:19:49.230
housed in a public mausoleum where it can be viewed to this very day,

367
00:19:49.580 --> 00:19:51.180
give all some left behind a troubled nation.

368
00:19:51.240 --> 00:19:54.600
One that would become further isolated and aggressive towards the world.

369
00:19:54.601 --> 00:19:55.590
Under his son's rule.

370
00:19:55.980 --> 00:19:59.520
His image is still prominent in the country presence at every train station and

371
00:19:59.530 --> 00:20:02.580
airport and dotting the landscape in the form of countless statues.

372
00:20:02.670 --> 00:20:06.390
His birthday is still a public holiday while the man who was forced from his

373
00:20:06.391 --> 00:20:10.260
birth home and fought tirelessly to get back there built a troubling legacy.

374
00:20:10.290 --> 00:20:14.730
The fact remains that he directly affected many of the 20th centuries biggest

375
00:20:14.731 --> 00:20:18.600
events, and that's no small feat. So really hope you found that video.
