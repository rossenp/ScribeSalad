00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:03.480
<v 0>It's been always 250 years since the United States of America was founded.</v>

2
00:00:03.481 --> 00:00:04.201
And in that time,

3
00:00:04.201 --> 00:00:07.620
the bloody war that followed the writing of the declaration of independence has

4
00:00:07.621 --> 00:00:12.420
been imbued with an almost mythical quality rather than a simple conflict over

5
00:00:12.421 --> 00:00:16.710
taxation and the right of self-governance the American revolution has instead

6
00:00:16.711 --> 00:00:18.390
become a morality tale,

7
00:00:18.420 --> 00:00:22.050
the triumph of good over evil of freedom over tyranny.

8
00:00:22.200 --> 00:00:25.800
The many played a part in the country's formation has become legendary figures.

9
00:00:26.010 --> 00:00:30.210
None more so than George Washington. Everyone knows who George Washington is.

10
00:00:30.360 --> 00:00:35.310
His face is on the $1 bill. The Capitol of the United States is named after him.

11
00:00:35.311 --> 00:00:39.720
And the tallest structure in the Capitol is a monument that is dedicated to him.

12
00:00:39.900 --> 00:00:42.630
He was the victorious general of the revolutionary war,

13
00:00:42.631 --> 00:00:45.720
and then served as the first president of the United States.

14
00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:48.780
His face and name are pretty much everywhere.

15
00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:52.980
The Romans used to worship dead emperors as gods and the U S has come very close

16
00:00:52.981 --> 00:00:55.710
to doing the same to George Washington,

17
00:00:55.890 --> 00:00:58.740
but buried beneath the myth is the story of a real man,

18
00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:01.080
a man who is full of contradictions,

19
00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:03.030
Washington fought for the freedom of others.

20
00:01:03.031 --> 00:01:05.550
Yet he himself owned hundreds of slaves.

21
00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:08.280
He is known as a master military strategist.

22
00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:11.760
Yet he made several major mistakes that almost cost the Americans.

23
00:01:11.761 --> 00:01:14.310
The war here's called the father of the country.

24
00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:18.930
Yet he has no children of his own. He wasn't perfect. He certainly wasn't a God.

25
00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:21.330
But what he was was uniquely American

26
00:01:34.130 --> 00:01:35.960
Washington was born on February the 22nd,

27
00:01:35.961 --> 00:01:38.990
1732 in the English colony of Virginia.

28
00:01:39.020 --> 00:01:42.880
The Washington family had immigrated to Virginia from England in the 1650s and

29
00:01:42.900 --> 00:01:45.350
had become one of the wealthiest families in the colony.

30
00:01:45.380 --> 00:01:49.040
They owned several tobacco plantations that were worked by hundreds of slaves

31
00:01:49.190 --> 00:01:49.880
and the wealth,

32
00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:53.630
this produced for them allowed them to become foremost among the new class of

33
00:01:53.631 --> 00:01:57.650
American aristocrats, a status they'd been unable to achieve back in England.

34
00:01:57.770 --> 00:02:01.460
Augustine Washington George's father was very active in local politics,

35
00:02:01.461 --> 00:02:04.220
serving as a justice of the peace and County sheriff.

36
00:02:04.250 --> 00:02:08.720
He died suddenly in 1743 when George was 11 years old and much of the

37
00:02:08.721 --> 00:02:13.190
Washington's estate was handled by George's older brother Lawrence who George

38
00:02:13.191 --> 00:02:16.610
idolized, Washington was considered well-educated for amount of his time.

39
00:02:16.640 --> 00:02:19.940
He was trained as a land surveyor and showed talent as a mapmaker and a

40
00:02:19.941 --> 00:02:20.540
draftsman.

41
00:02:20.540 --> 00:02:25.250
But the teenager wasn't content with such a sedate profession and he craved

42
00:02:25.280 --> 00:02:28.190
action and adventure. When George was 19,

43
00:02:28.191 --> 00:02:30.470
his brother Lawrence became ill with tuberculosis.

44
00:02:30.500 --> 00:02:33.890
The brothers traveled to Barbados hoping that the warm climate would alleviate

45
00:02:33.891 --> 00:02:37.640
the condition, but Lawrence died in 1752 and George returns home.

46
00:02:37.670 --> 00:02:39.350
Now the sign of the Washington family.

47
00:02:39.440 --> 00:02:40.273
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

48
00:02:46.310 --> 00:02:47.270
<v 0>Virginia Washington,</v>

49
00:02:47.271 --> 00:02:52.010
sorta commission in the Virginia colonial militia being appointed as a major by

50
00:02:52.011 --> 00:02:53.810
the new tenant governor of the colony.

51
00:02:53.870 --> 00:02:57.440
It joins the military at a very dangerous time on the frontier to the West of

52
00:02:57.441 --> 00:02:58.970
the established British colonies.

53
00:02:58.990 --> 00:03:02.410
They are higher river Valley was being contested by both great Britain and

54
00:03:02.411 --> 00:03:03.040
France.

55
00:03:03.040 --> 00:03:07.120
Both of whom were building forts at strategic locations to solidify their hold

56
00:03:07.121 --> 00:03:07.870
on the territory.

57
00:03:07.870 --> 00:03:11.140
Washington was named deputy commander of the Virginia regimens that first

58
00:03:11.141 --> 00:03:12.970
professional colonial military units,

59
00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:15.640
the regiment was ordered to March to the forks of the Ohio,

60
00:03:15.641 --> 00:03:18.310
the future site of the city of Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania,

61
00:03:18.520 --> 00:03:21.880
to oppose the French movement there in 1754. On the way there,

62
00:03:21.881 --> 00:03:25.870
the commander of the regiment, Joshua Fry fell off his horse and broke his neck.

63
00:03:25.900 --> 00:03:28.990
He died soon thereafter and his commands, pastor Washington,

64
00:03:29.260 --> 00:03:32.590
Washington arrives at the forks and discovered the French had gotten there first

65
00:03:32.591 --> 00:03:34.660
and began construction of their own fortress,

66
00:03:35.020 --> 00:03:38.610
forced decane Washington retreated to contemplate his next move. And,

67
00:03:38.611 --> 00:03:41.950
and he was joined there by our friends who had made the year before the sacrum

68
00:03:41.951 --> 00:03:44.170
of the Mingo tribe, Tana chairperson,

69
00:03:44.500 --> 00:03:48.160
Tana chairperson informs him of a force of about 35 French soldiers approaching

70
00:03:48.280 --> 00:03:51.880
their position and suggested an attack on may the 28th, 1754,

71
00:03:51.881 --> 00:03:55.120
the two forces confronted each other what's happened is next is a master of

72
00:03:55.121 --> 00:03:58.690
dispute. All that is known for sure is that by the end of the encounter,

73
00:03:58.691 --> 00:04:01.540
most of the French detachment was dead, including its commander,

74
00:04:01.720 --> 00:04:03.160
Joseph [inaudible].

75
00:04:03.370 --> 00:04:07.030
The French would claim that Davinia was there on a peaceful diplomatic mission

76
00:04:07.031 --> 00:04:08.020
was massacred. Well,

77
00:04:08.110 --> 00:04:10.960
Washington believed that the French would that to spawn his forces,

78
00:04:11.020 --> 00:04:14.650
whatever happens the battle of juvenile Glenn, as it later became known,

79
00:04:14.800 --> 00:04:18.970
proved to be the spark that touched off a worldwide war between great Britain

80
00:04:18.971 --> 00:04:21.040
and France known as the seven years' war.

81
00:04:21.160 --> 00:04:24.430
After the violence that German Avila Glenn Washington figured that the French

82
00:04:24.431 --> 00:04:28.120
Garrison at Fort Duquesne was going to attack him sooner or later.

83
00:04:28.120 --> 00:04:30.880
So we built a Fort of his own called Fort necessity.

84
00:04:31.060 --> 00:04:33.910
It was a crude construction, essentially, a wooden Palisade,

85
00:04:33.911 --> 00:04:34.930
and it wouldn't hold off.

86
00:04:34.931 --> 00:04:39.070
They determined to solve for long Louie [inaudible] outraged at his brother's

87
00:04:39.071 --> 00:04:43.420
death led a force of 600 soldiers to Fort necessity and attacked it on July.

88
00:04:43.421 --> 00:04:45.970
The third, the Virginians were on disciplines.

89
00:04:45.971 --> 00:04:48.490
They fled on the fire is at one point during the day,

90
00:04:48.491 --> 00:04:50.590
broke into the liquor cabinets and got drunk.

91
00:04:50.650 --> 00:04:53.590
When the French offered to allow him to return to Virginia with his troops on

92
00:04:53.591 --> 00:04:56.050
harms. If he surrendered the Fort to them, Washington,

93
00:04:56.051 --> 00:05:00.220
that felt he had no choice and marched back to what he thought was disgrace and

94
00:05:00.430 --> 00:05:02.620
the end of his military career to his surprise,

95
00:05:02.621 --> 00:05:06.160
the Virginia House of Burgesses blames the Devita Fort necessity on other

96
00:05:06.161 --> 00:05:08.050
factors and not on Washington. The next year,

97
00:05:08.051 --> 00:05:11.560
the British center force of 2000 soldiers under the command of general Edward

98
00:05:11.561 --> 00:05:13.690
Braddock to capture Fort Duquesne.

99
00:05:13.840 --> 00:05:17.230
Washington came along as a guide because of his experience with this area,

100
00:05:17.290 --> 00:05:21.040
the British met with disaster at the battle of Monongahela on July the ninth,

101
00:05:21.041 --> 00:05:25.120
1755, two thirds of the British force was killed or wounded, including Braddock,

102
00:05:25.150 --> 00:05:25.690
Washington,

103
00:05:25.690 --> 00:05:29.170
and some distinction during the basle by forming a rear guard to prevent the

104
00:05:29.620 --> 00:05:33.100
retreats from turning into a route resulting in even more casualties,

105
00:05:33.160 --> 00:05:36.070
Washington would serve in the colonial militia until 1758.

106
00:05:36.071 --> 00:05:37.480
When he resigned in disgust,

107
00:05:37.481 --> 00:05:40.630
after being rebuffed in his attempts to secure a Royal commission and the

108
00:05:40.631 --> 00:05:41.650
British regular army,

109
00:05:41.680 --> 00:05:44.590
the British commanders dismissed Washington and other colonial leaders as

110
00:05:44.591 --> 00:05:48.550
amateurs and simpletons and assessments that would come back to haunt them a bit

111
00:05:48.610 --> 00:05:49.443
later.

112
00:05:55.290 --> 00:05:55.410
<v 2>In.</v>

113
00:05:55.410 --> 00:05:58.340
<v 0>1759, Washington married Carter's so young,</v>

114
00:05:58.341 --> 00:06:01.550
wealthy widow with one of the largest plantations in Virginia,

115
00:06:01.730 --> 00:06:03.920
when combined with Washington zone holdings,

116
00:06:03.950 --> 00:06:06.020
he was now one of the richest men in the colonies.

117
00:06:06.140 --> 00:06:09.770
He delighted in raising your stepchildren, Jack and Patsy casters.

118
00:06:09.771 --> 00:06:12.320
Although he and Martha never had any children of their own,

119
00:06:12.321 --> 00:06:15.950
despite being married for 40 years, it is believed that about with smallpox.

120
00:06:15.951 --> 00:06:19.490
As a young man had rented him sterile Washington, entered politics,

121
00:06:19.491 --> 00:06:22.010
serving in the house of Burgesses and entertaining.

122
00:06:22.011 --> 00:06:24.320
People of rank it as a state Mount Vernon.

123
00:06:24.390 --> 00:06:28.880
He grew increasingly concerned throughout the 1760s and early 1770s with the

124
00:06:28.881 --> 00:06:32.930
British Parliament's attempts to exert more control over the American colonies

125
00:06:32.931 --> 00:06:34.460
through taxes, Washington,

126
00:06:34.461 --> 00:06:38.030
and many others felt that this was an act of tyranny since the Americans had no

127
00:06:38.031 --> 00:06:41.990
representation in the government that was making the laws that they were subject

128
00:06:41.991 --> 00:06:44.450
to in 1775, the increased tension.

129
00:06:44.540 --> 00:06:48.320
It finally snapped into open conflict in Boston where British troops under

130
00:06:48.321 --> 00:06:52.520
general Thomas gage were trying to subjugate and increasingly rebellious

131
00:06:52.521 --> 00:06:56.420
colonial populous at Lexington and Concord on April the 19th,

132
00:06:56.421 --> 00:06:59.870
British regulars and colonial militia sheltered each other for the first time,

133
00:07:00.470 --> 00:07:03.950
formally beginning the American revolutionary war Washington represented

134
00:07:03.951 --> 00:07:06.860
Virginia at the second continental Congress in Philadelphia,

135
00:07:06.890 --> 00:07:11.630
which opens soon after the bloodshed in Massachusetts, on June the 14th, 1775,

136
00:07:11.631 --> 00:07:15.110
the Congress created the continent's Alarmy to provide for the common defense of

137
00:07:15.111 --> 00:07:18.590
the colonies and talk of who would command the new army.

138
00:07:18.920 --> 00:07:22.370
Soon turn to Washington. Washington had never actively campaigned for the job,

139
00:07:22.400 --> 00:07:25.880
but he was the only delegate who attended meetings of the Congress wearing a

140
00:07:25.881 --> 00:07:30.470
military uniform, which is a perfect example of dressing for the job you want.

141
00:07:30.920 --> 00:07:32.720
That's combined with his height. He was six foot two,

142
00:07:32.721 --> 00:07:34.790
which was much taller than the other delegates,

143
00:07:34.791 --> 00:07:38.150
as well as the fact that he was the most famous soldier in the colonies because

144
00:07:38.151 --> 00:07:39.770
of his war service 20 years earlier,

145
00:07:39.950 --> 00:07:43.460
made him the unanimous choice to lead the new army. On June the 19th,

146
00:07:43.461 --> 00:07:45.740
he received his commission and three days later, he departed

147
00:07:52.390 --> 00:07:53.890
When Washington arrived in Boston,

148
00:07:53.891 --> 00:07:57.610
he found his army was really a ragtag group of militia units with no real

149
00:07:57.611 --> 00:08:00.310
organization after the battles of Lexington and Concord,

150
00:08:00.390 --> 00:08:03.190
and the British had retreated back into the city and as the Patriots,

151
00:08:03.250 --> 00:08:07.150
as they began to call themselves at blocks off the land routes into the city and

152
00:08:07.151 --> 00:08:08.200
to put it under siege,

153
00:08:08.260 --> 00:08:11.680
Washington immediately began shaping the militia into a proper army while

154
00:08:11.830 --> 00:08:14.740
keeping the British bottles up in Boston. In October King, George,

155
00:08:14.741 --> 00:08:18.580
the third replaced general gauge with a new commander William Howe finally in

156
00:08:18.581 --> 00:08:19.810
March of 1776,

157
00:08:19.811 --> 00:08:23.380
the continental army placed cannons on the high grounds of Dorchester Heights

158
00:08:23.381 --> 00:08:25.900
and the games bombard the British positions in Boston.

159
00:08:26.050 --> 00:08:28.780
This compelled how to retreat to Halifax by sea.

160
00:08:28.781 --> 00:08:31.750
And as the Americans had won their first victory, Washington,

161
00:08:31.751 --> 00:08:33.940
wasn't about to rest on his laurels. However,

162
00:08:34.150 --> 00:08:37.690
a few weeks later he moved his army South to New York city, Washington.

163
00:08:37.690 --> 00:08:41.450
And how both knew that New York was key to controlling the continence and

164
00:08:41.590 --> 00:08:45.340
Washington expected a British invasion force to attack that he spent the next

165
00:08:45.341 --> 00:08:48.640
few months preparing fortifications and continuing to train his troops.

166
00:08:48.700 --> 00:08:52.000
British ships began arriving in New York Harbor on the 2nd of July.

167
00:08:52.180 --> 00:08:54.640
We're always boosted in the continental army a few days later,

168
00:08:55.090 --> 00:08:57.840
word them of the ratification of the declaration of independence,

169
00:08:57.841 --> 00:09:01.560
which stated that the colonies were declaring themselves free and independent

170
00:09:01.561 --> 00:09:03.600
States on August the 22nd general,

171
00:09:03.780 --> 00:09:07.860
how landed at Brooklyn on the Western end of long Island with 20,000 troops,

172
00:09:07.890 --> 00:09:09.990
five days later, he attacked Washington's position.

173
00:09:10.030 --> 00:09:12.900
The battle of long islands was a stinging American defeat.

174
00:09:13.050 --> 00:09:15.360
The continental suffered 20% casualties.

175
00:09:15.390 --> 00:09:18.000
The American revolution could have ended right there,

176
00:09:18.030 --> 00:09:22.170
but Washington organized a stealthy nighttime retreat across the East river onto

177
00:09:22.171 --> 00:09:24.930
Manhattan islands. When the British short, the next day,

178
00:09:25.050 --> 00:09:28.560
they were astonished to find that the Americans were simply gone on September

179
00:09:28.561 --> 00:09:31.020
the 15th. The British landed on Manhattan islands.

180
00:09:31.050 --> 00:09:33.870
The American troops did not even attempt to stand and fight,

181
00:09:33.900 --> 00:09:38.070
but fled in a panicked route. Washington was enraged. The cowardice of his men.

182
00:09:38.071 --> 00:09:41.280
And at one point was within a hundred yards of the advancing British troops.

183
00:09:41.460 --> 00:09:44.700
An aide had to grab the bridle of the General's horse and lead him away.

184
00:09:44.760 --> 00:09:48.630
New York fell soon after runs would be occupied by the British for the remainder

185
00:09:48.631 --> 00:09:49.290
of the war.

186
00:09:49.290 --> 00:09:52.800
The continental army was pushed through New Jersey and into Pennsylvania.

187
00:09:52.801 --> 00:09:56.700
When winter sat in and Halbrook off his pursuit in the 18th century,

188
00:09:56.701 --> 00:09:59.850
armies typically did not fight in Windsor and how returned to New York.

189
00:09:59.851 --> 00:10:01.800
So wait for the spring thought, Washington,

190
00:10:01.801 --> 00:10:03.750
meanwhile knew that he had to do something.

191
00:10:03.900 --> 00:10:07.680
Morale was at an all time low desertions were increasing in Washington figured

192
00:10:07.681 --> 00:10:10.740
if he didn't attack to quickly, his entire army would dissolve.

193
00:10:16.910 --> 00:10:20.850
Washington has developed an effective spy network by the end of 1776,

194
00:10:21.140 --> 00:10:25.550
since he received intelligence that a Garrison of 1,500 German mercenaries has

195
00:10:26.030 --> 00:10:28.550
scions where in winter quarters, near trends in New Jersey,

196
00:10:28.610 --> 00:10:31.190
they were complacent and not expecting an attack.

197
00:10:31.370 --> 00:10:33.290
That was where Washington planters strike.

198
00:10:33.320 --> 00:10:37.520
He hopes a victory would boost Patriot morale and lead to a surge in volunteers

199
00:10:37.580 --> 00:10:39.740
on Christmas night, Washington led his army on a stealthy,

200
00:10:40.100 --> 00:10:42.230
nighttime crossing of the Delaware river into New Jersey,

201
00:10:42.231 --> 00:10:45.260
remarkable military feat. On the morning of December the 26th,

202
00:10:45.261 --> 00:10:48.980
the Continentals took the Haskins completely by surprise and took over 800 of

203
00:10:48.981 --> 00:10:49.520
them prisoner.

204
00:10:49.520 --> 00:10:53.240
They also took tons of crucial supplies and weapons to equip their army with a

205
00:10:53.241 --> 00:10:56.270
few days later, the British attacks Washington's position at Trenton,

206
00:10:56.271 --> 00:10:59.690
and we're a pulsed Ben in another remarkable military maneuver,

207
00:10:59.810 --> 00:11:03.110
Washington circled around the British army and attack the Garrison at Princeton

208
00:11:03.230 --> 00:11:06.080
inflicting the third defeat on the British in 10 days,

209
00:11:06.140 --> 00:11:09.770
the British retreated from Southern New Jersey and Thailand Washington finally

210
00:11:09.771 --> 00:11:11.990
went into winter quarters at Morristown.

211
00:11:12.290 --> 00:11:15.620
This stunning series of victories likely saved Washington's army,

212
00:11:15.740 --> 00:11:17.630
but the war was still far from over.

213
00:11:24.020 --> 00:11:24.590
<v 1>British.</v>

214
00:11:24.590 --> 00:11:29.540
<v 0>For the war in 1777 was more complex than the year before an invasion army led</v>

215
00:11:29.541 --> 00:11:31.700
by general John Burgoyne called gentlemen,

216
00:11:31.730 --> 00:11:35.480
Johnny for his elaborate uniforms and lavish lifestyle would advance South from

217
00:11:35.481 --> 00:11:39.320
Quebec to take Albany New York. The goal was to isolate new England's,

218
00:11:39.321 --> 00:11:41.510
which had the highest concentration of Patriots.

219
00:11:41.600 --> 00:11:44.540
And it was contributing the bulk of volunteers to the continental army from the

220
00:11:44.541 --> 00:11:45.440
rest of the colonies,

221
00:11:45.441 --> 00:11:49.160
which they felt would be easier to control how in New York were supposed to send

222
00:11:49.161 --> 00:11:50.540
troops to support Bitcoin,

223
00:11:50.570 --> 00:11:54.700
but controversially failed to do so like D due to personal rivalries between the

224
00:11:54.701 --> 00:11:58.060
senior British commanders. Instead in the summer of 1777,

225
00:11:58.090 --> 00:12:01.420
how's it out from New York to capture Philadelphia where the continental

226
00:12:01.421 --> 00:12:02.254
Congress met,

227
00:12:02.290 --> 00:12:06.070
how defeated Washington at the battle of Brandywine in September and did

228
00:12:06.071 --> 00:12:09.070
Philadelphia. The Congress fled West to York, Pennsylvania,

229
00:12:09.100 --> 00:12:13.090
but the real action was taking place in the North. In New York. Gentlemen,

230
00:12:13.390 --> 00:12:15.520
Johnny had led his men into a tramp without realizing it,

231
00:12:15.521 --> 00:12:18.760
finding themselves completely surrounded by an American army commanded by her

232
00:12:18.761 --> 00:12:21.490
ratio Gates. He expected help for help, never came.

233
00:12:21.520 --> 00:12:25.630
And he was defeated in detail by the Americans in two battles at Saratoga in

234
00:12:25.631 --> 00:12:27.670
September and October products over the 17th,

235
00:12:27.671 --> 00:12:29.620
he was forced to surrender his army to Gates.

236
00:12:29.680 --> 00:12:32.560
The surrender of Bitcoin sent shock waves around the world.

237
00:12:32.590 --> 00:12:35.590
Nowhere more so than in Paris, since the war began,

238
00:12:35.591 --> 00:12:38.500
the French government had been looking for a reason to support the American

239
00:12:38.501 --> 00:12:40.690
cause since it would hurt their British rivals,

240
00:12:40.780 --> 00:12:43.570
the victory of the Americans at Saratoga convinced King Louis,

241
00:12:43.571 --> 00:12:47.860
the 16th that the Americans could stand up as a fighting force and entered into

242
00:12:47.861 --> 00:12:50.920
a formal Alliance with the Americans. By the end of 1777,

243
00:12:50.950 --> 00:12:54.160
they promised troops money supplies, and most importantly,

244
00:12:54.460 --> 00:12:58.300
and Naval fleet something. The American sorely lacked Horacio Gates. Meanwhile,

245
00:12:58.301 --> 00:12:59.530
took much credit for the victory,

246
00:12:59.650 --> 00:13:03.310
despite not having much to do with the actual battle strategy itself.

247
00:13:03.460 --> 00:13:07.660
And he used it to advocate himself to replace Washington as general in chief and

248
00:13:08.380 --> 00:13:09.550
attempt this ultimately failed.

249
00:13:15.540 --> 00:13:15.810
<v 1>[Inaudible].</v>

250
00:13:15.810 --> 00:13:19.770
<v 0>Washington's army made winter camp at Valley forge North of Philadelphia.</v>

251
00:13:19.830 --> 00:13:21.000
That Windsor was brutal.

252
00:13:21.030 --> 00:13:25.080
Busily cold and snowy ends around 2,500 American soldiers died at the

253
00:13:25.680 --> 00:13:25.860
encampment.

254
00:13:25.860 --> 00:13:28.980
The American cause was greatly helped by the presence of two foreign officers

255
00:13:28.981 --> 00:13:32.970
who wanted to help the American cause the Marquis de Lafayette. So 19 year old,

256
00:13:32.971 --> 00:13:37.350
French nobleman and soldier sailed for America in late 1777 against the orders

257
00:13:37.351 --> 00:13:40.260
of his King and was made a general by Washington laughing.

258
00:13:40.440 --> 00:13:42.840
It's brought knowledge of European warfare to the Americans,

259
00:13:42.841 --> 00:13:44.400
and he had a positive effect on morale.

260
00:13:44.460 --> 00:13:47.940
It is believed that the eventual Alliance between France and the Americans was

261
00:13:48.450 --> 00:13:52.030
jus in no small parts to his efforts. Meanwhile, Baron Friedrich Von Steuben,

262
00:13:52.230 --> 00:13:55.860
former Prussian army officer and administrator left Germany after being accused

263
00:13:55.861 --> 00:13:59.820
of having homosexual affairs. He arrived at Valley forge in February,

264
00:13:59.820 --> 00:14:01.590
1778 and was made inspector general of the army.

265
00:14:01.740 --> 00:14:05.280
He was influential in developing a training program that turns the continental

266
00:14:05.530 --> 00:14:07.950
army into a professional fighting force. He was a colorful figure,

267
00:14:08.130 --> 00:14:12.000
elaborately dressed and prone to cursing at the soldiers in several languages

268
00:14:12.120 --> 00:14:16.740
facing fallout from the campaign of 1777 general Howe resigned and was replaced

269
00:14:16.741 --> 00:14:19.530
by sir Henry Clinton, Vinson abandons, Philadelphia,

270
00:14:19.560 --> 00:14:21.720
and marched back to New York, pursued by Washington.

271
00:14:21.780 --> 00:14:26.580
The two armies fought an indecisive battle at Monmouth on June the 28th and came

272
00:14:26.581 --> 00:14:29.580
back to New York to discover a French fleet in New York Harbor.

273
00:14:29.610 --> 00:14:33.090
The French had declared war on great Britain and what's it been a regional civil

274
00:14:33.091 --> 00:14:37.260
conflict was now a continent spanning war involving several major European

275
00:14:37.261 --> 00:14:37.740
powers.

276
00:14:37.740 --> 00:14:40.860
The British government now were sending few reinforcements to their armies in

277
00:14:40.861 --> 00:14:44.400
America, more concerned with protecting their Caribbean possessions.

278
00:14:44.640 --> 00:14:48.000
The focus of the war now moved to the Southern colonies after the British

279
00:14:48.001 --> 00:14:50.820
captured the city of Charleston, South Carolina in early 17,

280
00:14:50.821 --> 00:14:55.370
80 and army commanded by Nord Wallace routed Horatio Gates at the battle of

281
00:14:55.371 --> 00:14:57.800
Camden, which ended Gates his military career.

282
00:14:57.890 --> 00:14:59.960
He was replaced by general Nathaniel green,

283
00:14:59.961 --> 00:15:02.720
who engaged in hit and run tactics with Cornwallis.

284
00:15:02.840 --> 00:15:06.770
His army that slowed their advanced North to Virginia Washington whose ranks

285
00:15:06.771 --> 00:15:10.700
were now swelled by French soldiers and a French Naval fleet received word that

286
00:15:11.030 --> 00:15:14.600
Cornell has moved his army to Yorktown sensing an opportunity to trap him that

287
00:15:14.750 --> 00:15:17.930
Washington moved his army away from York to Virginia.

288
00:15:18.530 --> 00:15:19.610
Cornwallis found himself surrounded.

289
00:15:19.700 --> 00:15:23.120
He wasn't able to retreat by sea because the French fleet had blockaded it.

290
00:15:23.121 --> 00:15:26.240
And Washington's troops lead siege to his fortifications.

291
00:15:26.330 --> 00:15:29.270
After two weeks of battle, I want us to realize the situation was hopeless.

292
00:15:29.360 --> 00:15:32.450
He surrendered to the allied army on October the 19th 1781.

293
00:15:32.480 --> 00:15:36.290
The war was for all intents and purposes over the defeat of Yorktown caused the

294
00:15:36.291 --> 00:15:39.560
collapse of Lord North's government in London and the new government called fee

295
00:15:40.040 --> 00:15:41.510
storks in September, 1783,

296
00:15:41.660 --> 00:15:45.680
the treaty of Paris was signed in which great Britain recognized the United

297
00:15:45.680 --> 00:15:47.000
States of America as an independent nation.

298
00:15:47.090 --> 00:15:51.050
The last British troops left New York at the end of 1783 against all the odds

299
00:15:51.051 --> 00:15:52.730
and the hardships George Washington,

300
00:15:52.760 --> 00:15:57.080
and the continental army had won the war and earned America. Independence

301
00:16:04.210 --> 00:16:05.110
Was a national hero.

302
00:16:05.111 --> 00:16:08.350
Now there were many in Congress who were prepared to offer him the title of

303
00:16:08.351 --> 00:16:10.270
King, but Washington refused.

304
00:16:10.330 --> 00:16:13.600
He was the head of the army and could have easily taken power.

305
00:16:13.601 --> 00:16:16.780
How do you want to do, but Washington, wasn't interested in being a dictator.

306
00:16:16.900 --> 00:16:18.640
So in December of 1783,

307
00:16:18.641 --> 00:16:22.450
he voluntarily resigned his commissioners general in chief and returned to Mount

308
00:16:22.451 --> 00:16:24.580
Vernon. The articles of Confederation,

309
00:16:24.640 --> 00:16:27.340
which governs the new nation quickly proved to be inadequate.

310
00:16:27.341 --> 00:16:31.420
And it became clear this a national constitution was needed to establish a

311
00:16:31.421 --> 00:16:32.890
government for the United States.

312
00:16:32.950 --> 00:16:35.980
Washington was called out of retirement to serve as president of the

313
00:16:35.981 --> 00:16:39.640
constitutional convention of 1787 in Philadelphia, that,

314
00:16:39.720 --> 00:16:43.330
and he oversaw the creation of a document that still forms the basis of American

315
00:16:43.331 --> 00:16:45.310
law more than 200 years later,

316
00:16:45.490 --> 00:16:49.510
and serves as the basis for national constitutions all over the world.

317
00:16:49.630 --> 00:16:53.620
The first election for president of the United States was held in 1788 and

318
00:16:53.770 --> 00:16:56.110
Washington was elected to serve as the first president.

319
00:16:56.200 --> 00:16:59.080
He was inaugurated in New York city in April 17, 89.

320
00:16:59.170 --> 00:17:02.650
Being the firm's president Washington was left to define many of the precedents

321
00:17:02.651 --> 00:17:04.780
that still serve the executive branch today.

322
00:17:04.840 --> 00:17:08.860
He settled on being addressed as Mr. President turning down the more elaborate

323
00:17:08.861 --> 00:17:11.350
title, his excellent CC or his Highness,

324
00:17:11.380 --> 00:17:15.550
he gave the first inaugural address and the first presidential address to the

325
00:17:15.551 --> 00:17:16.930
assembled houses of Congress.

326
00:17:16.990 --> 00:17:20.890
He also forms the executive branch into a cabinet of department secretaries,

327
00:17:21.070 --> 00:17:22.750
which still persists to this day.

328
00:17:22.870 --> 00:17:27.190
Most of Washington's time as president was spent playing referee to two warring

329
00:17:27.191 --> 00:17:28.690
factions within his cabinets.

330
00:17:28.870 --> 00:17:32.110
Washington was the only president not to be a member of a political party.

331
00:17:32.111 --> 00:17:34.420
And didn't like the idea of them in the first place.

332
00:17:34.600 --> 00:17:36.700
The same could not be said of Alexander Hamilton,

333
00:17:36.701 --> 00:17:38.740
the secretary of the treasury and Thomas Jefferson,

334
00:17:38.741 --> 00:17:42.700
secretary of state Hamilton believed that the future of the nation was in strong

335
00:17:42.701 --> 00:17:47.200
federal government's national banking system and commerce in cities and forms

336
00:17:47.201 --> 00:17:50.790
the Federalist party while Jefferson favor decentralized governments controlled

337
00:17:50.791 --> 00:17:54.360
by the state since and economy controlled by agrarian interests.

338
00:17:54.360 --> 00:17:58.830
And he hated the idea of banks. He forms the Jeffersonian Republican party.

339
00:17:58.980 --> 00:18:02.730
The two were bits of rivals and cabinet meetings often degenerated into shouting

340
00:18:02.731 --> 00:18:06.420
matches with Washington and having to step in to maintain order in favor to

341
00:18:06.421 --> 00:18:10.170
Hamilton's plan and spent most of his first term on economic issues.

342
00:18:10.230 --> 00:18:14.580
He was exhausted by 1792 and showed no interest in running for a second term,

343
00:18:14.670 --> 00:18:18.930
but was begged to do so by all sides and was unanimously reelected by

344
00:18:18.931 --> 00:18:23.340
1796, the outright refuse to run for a third term and chose to retire. This set.

345
00:18:23.550 --> 00:18:24.120
Another president,

346
00:18:24.120 --> 00:18:28.230
no president would serve more than two times until Franklin Roosevelt in 1940

347
00:18:28.440 --> 00:18:31.140
and after Roosevelt died in office during his fourth term,

348
00:18:31.290 --> 00:18:34.920
Congress passed an amendment to the constitution that set the two term limits

349
00:18:35.040 --> 00:18:35.873
and to federal.

350
00:18:41.960 --> 00:18:42.380
<v 1>[Inaudible].</v>

351
00:18:42.380 --> 00:18:43.700
<v 0>And again, returned to Mount Vernon.</v>

352
00:18:43.730 --> 00:18:47.810
Vice-president John Adams being elected in 1796 as a second president during

353
00:18:47.811 --> 00:18:51.200
this time relations with France deteriorated after the French revolution.

354
00:18:51.350 --> 00:18:54.710
And it seems like there might be war Washington accepted the position of

355
00:18:54.711 --> 00:18:58.610
commander in chief of the United States army in 1798 to defend the country if it

356
00:18:58.611 --> 00:19:00.350
was attacked, but no army would appear.

357
00:19:00.440 --> 00:19:04.580
And Washington didn't have a field command on December the 13th, 1799.

358
00:19:04.581 --> 00:19:08.450
Washington started suffering from a sore throat. The next day it was even worse.

359
00:19:08.480 --> 00:19:09.460
Doctors were summons,

360
00:19:09.680 --> 00:19:12.950
but disagreed on what was causing the illness and what to do about it.

361
00:19:13.040 --> 00:19:15.950
At one point, nearly a pint of blood was drawn from him, blood blessing,

362
00:19:15.980 --> 00:19:17.990
being a common medical practice at the time though,

363
00:19:17.991 --> 00:19:22.370
it probably just made things worse at around 10:30 PM. On December the 14th,

364
00:19:22.400 --> 00:19:26.900
George Washington died age 67 news of his death touched off a wave of national

365
00:19:27.290 --> 00:19:29.510
morning that his funeral on December the 18th general,

366
00:19:29.511 --> 00:19:33.950
Henry Lee known as the light horse Harry gave the eulogy in an ironic twist of

367
00:19:33.951 --> 00:19:34.880
fate Lee's son.

368
00:19:34.880 --> 00:19:38.330
Robert Eley would be the leading figure in a rebellion against the nation that

369
00:19:38.331 --> 00:19:42.590
George Washington played a key role in founding Washington owns over 300 slaves

370
00:19:42.591 --> 00:19:43.460
at the time of his death.

371
00:19:43.550 --> 00:19:46.610
Slavery was essential to the building of his family's wealth,

372
00:19:46.640 --> 00:19:47.810
but as he grew older,

373
00:19:47.840 --> 00:19:51.740
Washington grew more uneasy with the institution of slavery. By the 1780s,

374
00:19:51.741 --> 00:19:55.640
Washington was privately in favor of emancipation. He kept signs on the map.

375
00:19:55.820 --> 00:19:59.330
So while presidents recognizing that it played such an oversized role in the

376
00:19:59.331 --> 00:20:00.650
economy of the Southern States,

377
00:20:00.860 --> 00:20:03.920
since that it could destroy the new nation Washington than the other founding

378
00:20:03.921 --> 00:20:07.970
fathers, his failure to settle the question of slavery would lead to civil war.

379
00:20:07.971 --> 00:20:09.830
60 years after Washington staff,

380
00:20:09.860 --> 00:20:12.860
Washington wanted to free his own slaves while he was still alive,

381
00:20:12.890 --> 00:20:15.140
but he wasn't able to persuade the other as of the Curtis,

382
00:20:15.141 --> 00:20:17.210
a state to free their slaves. At the same time,

383
00:20:17.450 --> 00:20:20.930
the slaves that worked at Mount Vernon had intermarried and started families and

384
00:20:21.080 --> 00:20:24.800
Washington said he did not want to break up those families by freeing some and

385
00:20:24.801 --> 00:20:25.460
not the rest.

386
00:20:25.460 --> 00:20:29.390
Meaning the ones not freed could still be sold to someone else and shipped away

387
00:20:29.600 --> 00:20:33.170
in his will be ordered that harvest slaves be freed immediately after his death,

388
00:20:33.200 --> 00:20:35.150
but the rest being freed off his death,

389
00:20:35.750 --> 00:20:39.230
Moffitt preempted this by freeing all of his slaves and January, 1801,

390
00:20:39.231 --> 00:20:40.700
but never freed her own slaves,

391
00:20:40.850 --> 00:20:44.780
thus causing the breakup of slave families that Washington had tried to prevent.

392
00:20:44.870 --> 00:20:47.800
She died in May, 1802 at the age of eight, Georgia.

393
00:20:47.810 --> 00:20:51.400
Martha Washington were entered at a tomb at Mount Vernon where they still are

394
00:20:51.401 --> 00:20:51.761
today.

395
00:20:51.761 --> 00:20:54.790
Despite some attempts by the American government to have the move to a tomb in

396
00:20:54.791 --> 00:20:55.780
Washington, DC.

397
00:20:55.781 --> 00:20:58.930
The new Capitol that was named after the nation's first president,

398
00:20:59.080 --> 00:21:01.600
after his death memorials and monuments to Washington,

399
00:21:01.601 --> 00:21:05.140
went up all over the country in the Capitol as the final 155 foot tall

400
00:21:05.141 --> 00:21:09.070
Washington monuments was completed in 1888 because of a federal law passed in

401
00:21:09.071 --> 00:21:11.740
1910 to limit the height of buildings in Washington, DC.

402
00:21:11.890 --> 00:21:15.430
The monument is the tallest building in the city and is likely to remain that

403
00:21:15.431 --> 00:21:16.264
way in the future.

404
00:21:16.300 --> 00:21:20.470
The myth of Washington outgrew the man Washington was very quickly a character

405
00:21:20.471 --> 00:21:24.490
emerged. That was almost God-like the person every American aspires to be.

406
00:21:24.520 --> 00:21:27.190
But we think that his story is interesting enough on its own,

407
00:21:27.191 --> 00:21:29.830
that it doesn't need to be embellished like that. Washington,

408
00:21:29.831 --> 00:21:32.980
the man was a far more complicated figure than Washington, the myths,

409
00:21:33.040 --> 00:21:35.920
but that just makes him more compelling as a historical figure.

410
00:21:36.220 --> 00:21:39.640
Perhaps lighthouse Henry Lee said it best in his eulogy of Washington when he

411
00:21:39.641 --> 00:21:41.620
described him as first in war,

412
00:21:41.800 --> 00:21:45.400
first in peace and first in the hearts of his countrymen.

00:21:45.760 --> 00:21:47.740
