6
00:00:18.800 --> 00:00:23.390
<v 0>American politics is rarely a setting for controversial heroes, Washington,</v>

7
00:00:23.480 --> 00:00:28.460
Jefferson Lincoln Roosevelt's public opinion has settled and congealed around

8
00:00:28.461 --> 00:00:32.440
these men. Offering Rosie soliloquy is of their patriotic fortitude.

9
00:00:32.480 --> 00:00:34.640
This echo throughout the generations,

10
00:00:34.700 --> 00:00:39.230
the American institution rarely examines the complex reality of its

11
00:00:39.231 --> 00:00:40.340
historical figures.

12
00:00:40.430 --> 00:00:44.930
That's simply not possible with today's protagonist modern day Macchia Valley,

13
00:00:45.170 --> 00:00:49.760
whose quick rise and fall to power forces us to weigh his intense

14
00:00:50.060 --> 00:00:51.260
against his methods.

15
00:00:51.320 --> 00:00:55.550
He was a smooth talking Louisiana and who considered himself a righteous every

16
00:00:55.551 --> 00:00:59.990
man, both before and after he took complete control over his state's political

17
00:00:59.991 --> 00:01:00.560
machine.

18
00:01:00.560 --> 00:01:05.270
He threatened assassinations installed puppet governors and ruthlessly

19
00:01:05.271 --> 00:01:09.620
taxed enemy factions, but it was all for the greater good of his people.

20
00:01:09.830 --> 00:01:14.390
Is there a room in a Republic for autocratic benevolence? Well,

21
00:01:14.420 --> 00:01:19.130
you be the judge while we examine the life and times of human.

22
00:01:25.790 --> 00:01:26.390
<v 1>[Inaudible].</v>

23
00:01:26.390 --> 00:01:30.110
<v 0>Long was born on August the 30th, 1893 in Winfield,</v>

24
00:01:30.111 --> 00:01:32.720
Louisiana long's family was quite large.

25
00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:37.580
His mother Caledonia to son and father Huey senior conceived nine living

26
00:01:37.581 --> 00:01:40.580
children here. He was the seventh at the turn of the century.

27
00:01:40.730 --> 00:01:44.930
Much of Louisiana was poor and uneducated, but even by local standards,

28
00:01:45.500 --> 00:01:49.400
Winfield was a tough place to make a living. The long family was far from rich,

29
00:01:49.401 --> 00:01:52.460
but they were well off relative to their surrounding community. Here.

30
00:01:52.550 --> 00:01:56.360
His senior Aaron's Caledonia made a living as livestock farmers and lived in a

31
00:01:56.361 --> 00:02:00.440
small Southern Manor house. The lungs rarely had much trouble making ends meet,

32
00:02:00.470 --> 00:02:04.280
but plenty of people around them did, which was a major influence on young Huey.

33
00:02:04.310 --> 00:02:06.740
One story recounts South as an eight year old boy,

34
00:02:06.770 --> 00:02:09.860
he watched his neighbor lose his house and farm at auction.

35
00:02:10.100 --> 00:02:12.260
When the neighbor failed to pay his debts on time,

36
00:02:12.320 --> 00:02:16.070
the farmer begged to be given his home back swearing. This had pay his dad's.

37
00:02:16.071 --> 00:02:19.490
If he just did a few more days to get the money together just as the sheriff was

38
00:02:19.491 --> 00:02:21.530
about to stop the auction and grants,

39
00:02:21.531 --> 00:02:25.250
the neighbors request accredits and made a bid winning the farm as an adult Huey

40
00:02:25.251 --> 00:02:28.040
long recalled the events remarketing that he was horrified.

41
00:02:28.220 --> 00:02:31.220
I could not understand. He said it seemed criminal.

42
00:02:32.150 --> 00:02:34.880
Winfield helps mold Huey long in more ways than one.

43
00:02:35.120 --> 00:02:37.100
It wasn't just the object poverty around him.

44
00:02:37.130 --> 00:02:41.840
It was also the unfiltered contempt that many of the Northern Louisianans felt

45
00:02:41.841 --> 00:02:44.270
for their richer Southern neighbors. As I said,

46
00:02:44.271 --> 00:02:47.540
Louisiana has never really been a wealthy state,

47
00:02:47.570 --> 00:02:52.220
but much of the money that it does have is concentrated in large population hubs

48
00:02:52.221 --> 00:02:55.580
like Baton Rouge and new Orleans, many people from Queens pole,

49
00:02:55.600 --> 00:02:56.900
North Louisiana towns,

50
00:02:56.901 --> 00:03:01.630
like Winfield's often resented the upper class that primarily resided

51
00:03:01.631 --> 00:03:04.600
closer to the coast, take the civil war as an example,

52
00:03:04.750 --> 00:03:06.070
like most of its Southern neighbors,

53
00:03:06.071 --> 00:03:10.720
Louisiana seceded from the union and fought as part of the Confederacy and the

54
00:03:10.721 --> 00:03:11.800
American civil war.

55
00:03:12.100 --> 00:03:15.550
When state representatives gathered for a vote on secession delegates from

56
00:03:15.551 --> 00:03:17.650
Winfield, voted to remain in the union,

57
00:03:17.680 --> 00:03:21.340
not because of any forward thinking positions on slavery or States' rights,

58
00:03:21.341 --> 00:03:26.020
but as the Winfield delegate petits who wants to fight to keep the Negroes for

59
00:03:26.021 --> 00:03:29.140
the wealthy planters. It wasn't a civil rights argument. That's all.

60
00:03:29.141 --> 00:03:31.600
It was class war out in the late 19th century,

61
00:03:31.630 --> 00:03:35.440
Winfield and the surrounding area became a local hub of populist politics.

62
00:03:35.441 --> 00:03:39.850
In 1912, the local parish actually supported the socialist party,

63
00:03:39.851 --> 00:03:43.570
presidential candidates, Eugene Debs over all other candidates.

64
00:03:43.810 --> 00:03:47.860
It was not a place that trusted corporate priorities or power structures.

65
00:03:48.040 --> 00:03:52.630
Those who did have jobs worked in blue collar industries, local lumber, mills,

66
00:03:52.631 --> 00:03:53.590
and salt mines,

67
00:03:54.130 --> 00:03:57.340
Huey lungs worldview was highly influenced by his childhood in Winfield.

68
00:03:57.520 --> 00:04:01.060
He was a curious child exploring the farm and the world around him,

69
00:04:01.061 --> 00:04:04.660
asking questions and listening to political philosophy from a young age,

70
00:04:04.810 --> 00:04:08.380
public schooling was sporadic in rural parts of Louisiana at the turn of the

71
00:04:08.381 --> 00:04:08.950
century.

72
00:04:08.950 --> 00:04:13.690
So here he was homeschooled until adolescence as was common for any boys.

73
00:04:13.691 --> 00:04:15.970
At the time when he finally did reach public school,

74
00:04:15.971 --> 00:04:19.360
he was initially praised as gifted with an uncommonly good memory.

75
00:04:19.450 --> 00:04:23.140
He routinely asked teachers to allow him to skip coursework or even in Tonya

76
00:04:23.141 --> 00:04:26.800
grades when he was already familiar with the material at Winfield high here we

77
00:04:26.801 --> 00:04:30.190
began. So it really uses intelligence on the debate team. At one point,

78
00:04:30.220 --> 00:04:33.580
he traveled to Baton Rouge and finished that in a statewide debate contest,

79
00:04:33.790 --> 00:04:36.970
running himself, an academic scholarship to attend LSU after high school.

80
00:04:37.240 --> 00:04:39.700
Unfortunately he would never be able to cash in on the winnings.

81
00:04:39.701 --> 00:04:43.360
He couldn't afford the textbooks or the room and bought QE would return to

82
00:04:43.900 --> 00:04:45.580
Winfield with his only remaining prize,

83
00:04:45.581 --> 00:04:49.360
being all that increased female attention that skilled high school debate club

84
00:04:49.361 --> 00:04:52.930
winners are accustomed to hear he soldiered on throughout his remaining course

85
00:04:53.110 --> 00:04:56.710
about graduating from Winfield high school in 1910 after completing the 11th

86
00:04:56.740 --> 00:04:59.260
grade, or at least that's what he thought.

87
00:04:59.320 --> 00:05:01.180
Just to see we long finished the 11th grade.

88
00:05:01.360 --> 00:05:02.680
Since we're set to receive his diploma,

89
00:05:02.830 --> 00:05:06.490
the state board of education passed a new laws saying that the 12th grade would

90
00:05:06.491 --> 00:05:10.750
be the new ending point for high school students QE the skilled debater as he

91
00:05:10.751 --> 00:05:14.740
was thought that the new law was a crock of crayfish and deep again,

92
00:05:14.770 --> 00:05:16.510
circulating a formal petition,

93
00:05:16.511 --> 00:05:21.040
denouncing the idea of 12th grade and formally criticizing the principal and

94
00:05:21.041 --> 00:05:24.280
teachers at Winfield hype. Ultimately here, he got his wish.

95
00:05:24.281 --> 00:05:27.970
He never had to complete the 12th grade because the school expelled him as a

96
00:05:27.971 --> 00:05:29.860
result. He never graduated from high school,

97
00:05:37.170 --> 00:05:38.850
High school education officially over.

98
00:05:38.880 --> 00:05:42.660
He knew he needed to find a job like a lot of biographics protagonists,

99
00:05:42.661 --> 00:05:47.100
Mr. Long was a multitalented man who could adequately perform quite a few tasks.

100
00:05:47.160 --> 00:05:50.820
He would sign up for just about any job that didn't involve farm work.

101
00:05:50.821 --> 00:05:53.430
He wasn't keen on chores around the house as a child.

102
00:05:53.431 --> 00:05:57.770
And he wasn't about to sign up for any more of it as an adult long wanted to be

103
00:05:57.771 --> 00:06:00.200
out in the world around people and things.

104
00:06:00.470 --> 00:06:05.120
He never wanted to end up back at home, surrounded by chickens and goats.

105
00:06:05.210 --> 00:06:08.930
So at the age of 17 long became a traveling salesman touring much of the

106
00:06:08.931 --> 00:06:13.010
American South and selling everything from cooking Sherry to home medicines,

107
00:06:13.130 --> 00:06:15.380
it was a job. He had quite a bit of natural talent for,

108
00:06:15.381 --> 00:06:19.220
and as Sanchi found success right out of school for a solid year,

109
00:06:19.250 --> 00:06:22.160
but as the economy stalls and sales became harder,

110
00:06:22.340 --> 00:06:26.270
long was forced out of his budding young sales career and forced to consider a

111
00:06:26.271 --> 00:06:27.200
new line of work.

112
00:06:27.290 --> 00:06:30.350
His mother who had always hoped her seventh son would use his God-given

113
00:06:30.351 --> 00:06:33.410
intellect and communication skills in a more righteous calling,

114
00:06:33.470 --> 00:06:37.070
pushed him to move to Oklahoma so that he might move in with his older brother,

115
00:06:37.071 --> 00:06:39.740
George and studied the Bible in the fall of 1911.

116
00:06:39.741 --> 00:06:43.700
He began attending seminary lectures at Oklahoma Baptist college in Shawnee.

117
00:06:43.760 --> 00:06:46.820
Well, attending lectures is a rather loose way of putting it long,

118
00:06:46.821 --> 00:06:51.170
quickly deduce that he was no man of the cloth and began skipping classes.

119
00:06:51.230 --> 00:06:53.810
The washed out of seminary school after one semester,

120
00:06:53.990 --> 00:06:58.160
much the chagrin of his devout Baptist mother. But before he left Oklahoma,

121
00:06:58.161 --> 00:07:00.230
he thought he might want to give law school. A try.

122
00:07:00.290 --> 00:07:03.680
George lends him a hundred dollars and pointed him towards the university of

123
00:07:03.681 --> 00:07:04.940
Oklahoma school of law,

124
00:07:04.941 --> 00:07:09.110
where he similarly lasted one semester received average grades,

125
00:07:09.111 --> 00:07:12.860
and didn't learn very much thanks to a slew of distractions ranging from girls

126
00:07:12.861 --> 00:07:16.010
to gambling. They enjoy the local political scene in Norman,

127
00:07:16.011 --> 00:07:18.140
where the university of Oklahoma is,

128
00:07:18.170 --> 00:07:20.910
but he never focused enough on law while he was in towns,

129
00:07:21.200 --> 00:07:23.510
really get serious about a career in litigation.

130
00:07:23.660 --> 00:07:26.330
He lost his a hundred dollars and a gambling ring, leaving towns.

131
00:07:26.340 --> 00:07:28.340
He returned to a promising sales position.

132
00:07:28.341 --> 00:07:32.090
This has opened up for him long was still a teenager when he left Oklahoma,

133
00:07:32.120 --> 00:07:35.120
but he had a real mind for sales. He learned early on that dressing.

134
00:07:35.121 --> 00:07:36.830
Well then just salesman credibility.

135
00:07:36.831 --> 00:07:40.850
And the playing music could help him draw a crowd and to foster a commercially

136
00:07:40.851 --> 00:07:41.780
appealing atmosphere,

137
00:07:41.870 --> 00:07:45.590
he tapped into his natural powers of empathy to connect with potential clients.

138
00:07:45.770 --> 00:07:48.800
As a traveling salesman who encountered working class people all over the

139
00:07:48.801 --> 00:07:49.551
American South,

140
00:07:49.551 --> 00:07:52.790
he quickly developed a sense of fellowship with everyday Americans.

141
00:07:53.030 --> 00:07:56.810
There was another relationship that Huey long was quickly developing to a

142
00:07:56.811 --> 00:08:00.830
blooming romance with a woman named Rose McConnell long and McConnell mass in

143
00:08:00.831 --> 00:08:01.700
1910,

144
00:08:01.730 --> 00:08:05.450
early in his sales career at a bake sale that had been organized in Shreveport

145
00:08:05.451 --> 00:08:08.450
to promote the sale of a lawn substitute called Carter lean.

146
00:08:08.960 --> 00:08:10.550
QE had a little bit of games.

147
00:08:10.551 --> 00:08:13.790
So he awarded the top two prizes to Rose and her mother,

148
00:08:13.820 --> 00:08:17.660
they married two and a half years later on April the 12th, 1913,

149
00:08:17.690 --> 00:08:22.490
the Gayoso hotel and Memphis Tennessee zones have three children named Rose

150
00:08:22.490 --> 00:08:25.910
Russell and Palmer sales remains a good career choice for long,

151
00:08:25.911 --> 00:08:30.440
but it also continued to prove inconsistent and fickle in 1914, the economy,

152
00:08:30.470 --> 00:08:30.920
again,

153
00:08:30.920 --> 00:08:35.210
through Huey and Rose out of the industry and back toward formal schooling.

154
00:08:35.211 --> 00:08:39.110
But this time he had a much clearer plan. His oldest brother, Julius,

155
00:08:39.190 --> 00:08:40.520
who was already a working attorney,

156
00:08:40.521 --> 00:08:43.280
helped him create a streamlined law school outline,

157
00:08:43.460 --> 00:08:46.070
specifically targeting and course material that he would need.

158
00:08:46.190 --> 00:08:48.440
<v 2>To know in order to pass the Bob Cuban.</v>

159
00:08:48.440 --> 00:08:52.340
<v 0>Rose moved to new Orleans and just three semesters. Later in 1915 here,</v>

160
00:08:52.341 --> 00:08:55.470
we had cobbled together enough knowledge and information that he was able to

161
00:08:55.471 --> 00:08:59.550
pass the bar exam. He was 21 at the time long returned to Winfield.

162
00:08:59.551 --> 00:09:01.230
When he now had the legal tools,

163
00:09:01.231 --> 00:09:05.430
he needed to grind his acts against the corporate interests that had grown to

164
00:09:05.431 --> 00:09:07.350
low over the course of his young life.

165
00:09:07.440 --> 00:09:11.730
They began building his reputation as a lawyer by representing poor powerless or

166
00:09:11.850 --> 00:09:13.710
disenfranchised Louisianans.

167
00:09:13.740 --> 00:09:16.830
He opens a law office in the space above the Winfield bank,

168
00:09:16.831 --> 00:09:18.720
which was run by his uncle George.

169
00:09:18.960 --> 00:09:22.140
He promptly sent waves through both the community and design family by

170
00:09:22.141 --> 00:09:24.630
representing a widow in court against the very bank.

171
00:09:24.631 --> 00:09:28.800
He shared a building with his uncle was incredulous that young Huey had taken

172
00:09:28.801 --> 00:09:31.710
the cases. It appeared to represent a conflict of interest here.

173
00:09:31.711 --> 00:09:34.680
He remarked that his uncle should feel complimented human long.

174
00:09:34.710 --> 00:09:36.600
Don't take out off the top waters,

175
00:09:36.900 --> 00:09:39.390
but after the big fish gage and massive Olson,

176
00:09:39.450 --> 00:09:42.180
that person speech aside long was gifted liar.

177
00:09:42.360 --> 00:09:45.990
It quickly gains notoriety in Northern Louisiana as an attorney who wasn't

178
00:09:45.991 --> 00:09:48.120
afraid of targeting powerful groups,

179
00:09:48.121 --> 00:09:51.840
making them popular among many of the local populists in 1918.

180
00:09:51.841 --> 00:09:53.340
After three years in Winfield,

181
00:09:53.520 --> 00:09:57.630
he then Rose moved to Shreveport where they had more clients and more resources

182
00:09:57.631 --> 00:09:58.470
at their disposal.

183
00:09:58.710 --> 00:10:03.060
He also began one of his life's biggest conflicts is ongoing standoff with John

184
00:10:03.061 --> 00:10:07.110
D Rockefeller's standard all company around the time that long moved to

185
00:10:07.111 --> 00:10:07.711
Shreveport.

186
00:10:07.711 --> 00:10:11.040
He also invested about a thousand dollars into a local well that eventually

187
00:10:11.041 --> 00:10:14.490
struck oil long was set to make a major profit off the investment,

188
00:10:14.491 --> 00:10:15.810
but Rockefeller standard oil,

189
00:10:15.811 --> 00:10:18.600
wasn't interested in buying the oil from this particular well,

190
00:10:18.750 --> 00:10:20.520
making it theoretically valuable,

191
00:10:20.550 --> 00:10:24.630
but practically useless long had made a sizable investment and gambled

192
00:10:24.631 --> 00:10:25.140
correctly.

193
00:10:25.140 --> 00:10:29.640
Yet he still lost his money because of the whims of standard oil is righteous

194
00:10:29.641 --> 00:10:32.610
anger alongside as established animosity towards power.

195
00:10:32.611 --> 00:10:36.780
And corporations touched off an ongoing feuds that he would continue to stoke

196
00:10:36.781 --> 00:10:38.010
for the remainder of his life.

197
00:10:38.100 --> 00:10:42.120
He called standard oil and invisible empire that was run by Petra new mites.

198
00:10:42.180 --> 00:10:45.180
He made his first formal shot across the bow in 1921.

199
00:10:45.181 --> 00:10:48.690
When he began representing a small oil company who had a disputed lease with

200
00:10:48.691 --> 00:10:53.100
standard oil long lost this court case, which only fueled his hatred more,

201
00:10:53.130 --> 00:10:57.510
but there was one interest for Huey long that captured his attention much more

202
00:10:57.511 --> 00:10:59.310
than legal battles and oil Wells.

203
00:10:59.340 --> 00:11:03.530
What began as a natural curiosity for politics thrown into a full fledged career

204
00:11:03.531 --> 00:11:08.030
interest and long was new longer contended to attack the power structure as a

205
00:11:08.031 --> 00:11:12.080
private citizen. He wanted to do it as an elected official. Now,

206
00:11:12.110 --> 00:11:13.730
just before we continue with the video today,

207
00:11:13.731 --> 00:11:15.950
I do want to take a quick moment to thank our sponsor.

208
00:11:16.220 --> 00:11:20.540
Thunder war thunder is a realistic free to play military vehicle combat game.

209
00:11:20.570 --> 00:11:24.560
It's available on PCPs for an X-Box one, but you only need one of those,

210
00:11:24.860 --> 00:11:26.060
no need to purchase it either.

211
00:11:26.240 --> 00:11:29.540
You just download the game and you get to playing in this game.

212
00:11:29.541 --> 00:11:34.520
There are over 1,500 historically accurate vehicles all the way from the 1920s

213
00:11:34.521 --> 00:11:37.130
to the 1990s, they're all carefully built,

214
00:11:37.220 --> 00:11:40.730
incredibly detailed and all the physics you can tell that it's really been

215
00:11:40.731 --> 00:11:44.720
sweated over plus the sound's really immersive. And look,

216
00:11:44.750 --> 00:11:47.570
you can just jump in for a quick games, arcade game.

217
00:11:47.571 --> 00:11:50.610
It's useful if you don't have a lot of time or you can play realistic and go

218
00:11:50.750 --> 00:11:55.690
over some more challenging stuff, or if hardcore, you can go for simulator, but,

219
00:11:55.930 --> 00:11:57.300
uh, yeah. Yeah. I mean, if you're new,

220
00:11:57.301 --> 00:11:59.850
you're probably just going to get your whipped over and over again.

221
00:11:59.851 --> 00:12:02.010
So maybe start in arcade and go for that.

225
00:12:14.220 --> 00:12:15.330
Let's get back to the video.

226
00:12:21.540 --> 00:12:21.810
<v 3>[Inaudible].</v>

227
00:12:21.810 --> 00:12:23.730
<v 0>Huey long officially became a politician.</v>

228
00:12:23.731 --> 00:12:27.180
When he ends elections of the state railroad commission in 1918,

229
00:12:27.181 --> 00:12:28.200
at the age of 25,

230
00:12:28.440 --> 00:12:32.130
he used his position on the three men board to limit corporate monopolies and

231
00:12:32.131 --> 00:12:34.200
reduce utility rates. For average households,

232
00:12:34.260 --> 00:12:36.180
he believed he was the sort of populist.

233
00:12:36.181 --> 00:12:41.130
Every man that 20th century American politics should rely upon just as long

234
00:12:41.280 --> 00:12:44.490
had quickly gains local acclaim as a populous minded attorney.

235
00:12:44.670 --> 00:12:48.570
He similarly gained statewide notoriety for the Halle raised from his elected

236
00:12:48.571 --> 00:12:49.080
position.

237
00:12:49.080 --> 00:12:52.590
The state railroad commission was eventually rechristened as the broader public

238
00:12:52.591 --> 00:12:55.590
service commission and long became its chairman. In 1922.

239
00:12:55.680 --> 00:12:59.220
His first act was to Sue the Cumberland telephone company for raising their

240
00:12:59.221 --> 00:13:02.970
rates by 20% for no particular reason, his first attempt to lost,

241
00:13:03.000 --> 00:13:05.790
but he argued his appeal before the U S Supreme court.

242
00:13:05.791 --> 00:13:08.760
And one Cumberland was forced to cut refund checks,

243
00:13:09.240 --> 00:13:11.760
totaling $440,000.

244
00:13:11.940 --> 00:13:16.170
This was distributed to 80,000 customers who had been overcharged subsequently

245
00:13:16.200 --> 00:13:17.970
chief justice, William Howard Taft,

246
00:13:17.971 --> 00:13:22.170
to describe as long as the most brilliant lawyer who ever practiced before the

247
00:13:22.171 --> 00:13:23.850
United States Supreme court,

248
00:13:23.910 --> 00:13:27.570
the Cumberland's case one long thousands of statewide fans. As I long,

249
00:13:27.571 --> 00:13:31.560
decided to run for governor in 1924, as he had done in his entire life.

250
00:13:31.590 --> 00:13:34.320
He mocked the ruling political establishment in new Orleans,

251
00:13:34.500 --> 00:13:38.910
labeling them as toothless pawns of malevolent companies like standard oil.

252
00:13:39.000 --> 00:13:40.860
Ultimately he finished third in the race,

253
00:13:40.861 --> 00:13:44.760
missing the runoff by about 7,000 votes, long blames, the poor weather,

254
00:13:44.761 --> 00:13:49.590
which wasn't an entirely unfair observation on his part with only 200 and some

255
00:13:49.591 --> 00:13:52.230
miles of paved roads in all of Louisiana at the time,

256
00:13:52.410 --> 00:13:56.430
heavy downpours transforms dirt roads into intractable. Muddy messes.

257
00:13:56.670 --> 00:14:00.810
Given that the core of long's base was the rural populist contingent.

258
00:14:00.990 --> 00:14:05.160
The weather almost certainly impacted his showing to some degree,

259
00:14:05.280 --> 00:14:06.900
but the weather wouldn't be a problem.

260
00:14:07.140 --> 00:14:11.340
Four years later when long successfully took the man's all from acting governor

261
00:14:11.520 --> 00:14:16.350
RML Simpson by 1928 long had carefully constructed a massive populist Alliance

262
00:14:16.351 --> 00:14:17.100
in Louisiana.

263
00:14:17.100 --> 00:14:21.300
He spent a four years trips in across the isolated Northern perishes building

264
00:14:21.301 --> 00:14:24.300
his coalition by a dozen blue collar workers at a time.

265
00:14:24.570 --> 00:14:28.200
He also improved his reputation in the more gilded Southern parts of the state

266
00:14:28.230 --> 00:14:32.400
by supporting Roman Catholic candidates in an area dominated by traditional

267
00:14:32.401 --> 00:14:33.720
Spanish and French heritage.

268
00:14:33.750 --> 00:14:37.560
He tied everything together with a slogan he adopted from 19th century populist,

269
00:14:37.561 --> 00:14:39.870
William Jennings, Bryan, every man, a King,

270
00:14:40.140 --> 00:14:44.580
but no one wears a crown long won the democratic primary election on January the

271
00:14:44.581 --> 00:14:45.900
17th, 1928.

272
00:14:46.110 --> 00:14:50.160
Just like the fact that it was a heated three way election long one by what was

273
00:14:50.161 --> 00:14:53.540
at the time, the largest margin in state history predictably.

274
00:14:53.541 --> 00:14:58.400
When songs you cruise in the general election winning more than 95% of the

275
00:14:58.401 --> 00:15:02.390
vote over a Republican candidate at young plat at 34 years old,

276
00:15:02.420 --> 00:15:05.870
Huey long became the youngest governor in the history of Louisiana.

277
00:15:06.080 --> 00:15:08.270
A record that still holds to this day.

278
00:15:08.480 --> 00:15:11.840
Long as the sentence to the governorship was a radical departure of state

279
00:15:11.841 --> 00:15:15.740
politics. Since Louisiana had become a state 116 years prior,

280
00:15:15.950 --> 00:15:19.940
it had more or less been governed by the same corrupt members of the good old

281
00:15:19.941 --> 00:15:23.900
boys network in Louisiana, all of whom had clear ties to the church,

282
00:15:24.020 --> 00:15:28.160
the upper-class or powerful corporate interests long's election undid all of

283
00:15:28.161 --> 00:15:31.970
that. Giving the average Louisiana a much more accessible ally.

284
00:15:31.971 --> 00:15:33.080
And the governors mentioned, okay,

285
00:15:33.160 --> 00:15:36.700
most Louisiana residents needed that ally in the late 1920s.

286
00:15:36.701 --> 00:15:41.620
Louisiana was arguably the poorest state in the U S with grossly underfunded,

287
00:15:41.621 --> 00:15:44.050
public works and public education systems.

288
00:15:44.140 --> 00:15:48.070
Those who could afford to navigate their children to and from school every day

289
00:15:48.190 --> 00:15:51.430
still had to purchase their own textbooks among other supplies,

290
00:15:51.580 --> 00:15:55.210
making regular old primary schools, a huge burden for most families.

291
00:15:56.170 --> 00:15:58.690
25% of adults could not read massive bridge tolls,

292
00:15:58.691 --> 00:16:02.800
limited people's ability to move around in their own communities and poll taxes,

293
00:16:02.890 --> 00:16:06.670
disenfranchised, poor people of all racial backgrounds and keep in mind.

294
00:16:07.000 --> 00:16:09.550
These were the good times. This was in 1928,

295
00:16:09.610 --> 00:16:12.310
just months before the start of the great depression.

296
00:16:12.490 --> 00:16:16.300
Everything was about to get a whole lot worse, long has solutions,

297
00:16:16.301 --> 00:16:17.470
do many of these problems,

298
00:16:17.471 --> 00:16:21.790
but his methodology is what catapulted him to national fame almost immediately.

299
00:16:21.820 --> 00:16:24.070
He fired hundreds of old guard bureaucrats,

300
00:16:24.071 --> 00:16:28.090
replacing them with friends and young populous to he believed would serve his

301
00:16:28.091 --> 00:16:32.350
vision of what Louisiana politics could be after consolidating his executive

302
00:16:32.351 --> 00:16:34.780
power and installing yes men every way he could.

303
00:16:35.140 --> 00:16:39.850
It began an ambitious 1929 legislative session designed at pushing through

304
00:16:40.090 --> 00:16:43.270
a number of bills that he had promised in his campaign,

305
00:16:43.271 --> 00:16:47.050
focusing on economic stimulus and improve state infrastructure.

306
00:16:47.290 --> 00:16:50.800
He lowered one bridge toll from $8 and 40 cents to 60 cents.

307
00:16:50.980 --> 00:16:54.640
He instituted his night courses for adult literacy that taught more than a

308
00:16:54.641 --> 00:16:56.950
hundred thousand people to read. By the end of his term,

309
00:16:57.160 --> 00:17:00.670
he levied a new tax on standard oil that paid for all textbooks for grade

310
00:17:00.671 --> 00:17:04.450
school, children long was to the enacting large scale wealth distribution,

311
00:17:04.451 --> 00:17:07.750
a political prospects that rarely succeeds on American soil,

312
00:17:07.780 --> 00:17:11.350
but Louisiana was so fundamentally broken by a hundred years of corruption.

313
00:17:11.980 --> 00:17:14.500
The most everyday people didn't seem to mind.

314
00:17:14.860 --> 00:17:18.730
That's not say that everyone was on board, however long, strong man methods.

315
00:17:19.150 --> 00:17:22.240
Well meaning, but they were also democratically dangerous.

316
00:17:22.241 --> 00:17:24.130
And it didn't take long for an organism.

317
00:17:24.310 --> 00:17:27.100
This political movement to rise up against it. In 1929,

318
00:17:27.130 --> 00:17:31.630
while long was drawing to Navy a new occupational license tax against his

319
00:17:31.631 --> 00:17:33.250
friends at the standard oil company.

320
00:17:33.550 --> 00:17:37.960
His project was met with cries of foul play opponents in the legislature called

321
00:17:37.961 --> 00:17:41.920
for an impeachment on the grounds of abuse of power among several other charges.

322
00:17:41.920 --> 00:17:46.090
And the impeachment was sustained with a 67 to 13 vote. When something,

323
00:17:46.100 --> 00:17:47.500
the prolonged camp discerns,

324
00:17:47.501 --> 00:17:50.970
the electric voting machine used for the impeachment vote may have been tampered

325
00:17:50.971 --> 00:17:54.480
with. And all our brawl broke out on the floor of the state house,

326
00:17:54.481 --> 00:17:58.890
which was locally christened as bloody Monday and reached its crescendo when

327
00:17:59.070 --> 00:18:01.590
Hugh his brother, Earl Bissell legislature on the neck,

328
00:18:01.680 --> 00:18:05.820
no word on whether or not along with secret vampire right this year,

329
00:18:05.940 --> 00:18:09.690
and this will be covered in a future season of true detective regarding the

330
00:18:09.691 --> 00:18:11.100
ongoing political charges.

331
00:18:11.400 --> 00:18:14.280
Huey continued to speak directly to the people of Louisiana,

332
00:18:14.281 --> 00:18:17.580
where he knew that he could best plead his case there's money.

333
00:18:17.700 --> 00:18:19.710
He was trying to earmark was for them, the people,

334
00:18:19.711 --> 00:18:24.120
and it was a good cause social programs that would help lift Louisiana out of

335
00:18:24.121 --> 00:18:26.130
the icy grips of poverty. Ultimately,

336
00:18:26.131 --> 00:18:29.070
the state house passed seven articles of impeachment to the Senate,

337
00:18:29.220 --> 00:18:32.730
which immediately declared it's intense to acquit long. If the charges,

338
00:18:32.731 --> 00:18:35.700
regardless of whether or not he was guilty in their eyes,

339
00:18:35.820 --> 00:18:39.150
the impeachment should have never gone forward in the first place until they

340
00:18:39.151 --> 00:18:42.900
were treating us with the lack of seriousness that they thought it deserved in

341
00:18:42.901 --> 00:18:47.100
all likelihood. Long's 1929. Impeachment was organized in backrooms by oil,

342
00:18:47.101 --> 00:18:51.900
tycoons and wealthy Titans of industry who wanted to rid themselves of the

343
00:18:51.901 --> 00:18:54.420
long nightmare before any more damage could be done.

344
00:18:54.720 --> 00:18:58.800
There were no lessons there for Hubie long about politics or democracy,

345
00:18:59.070 --> 00:19:02.400
only power. He doubled down on his authoritarian strategies,

346
00:19:02.401 --> 00:19:04.410
committing to violence, intimidation,

347
00:19:04.560 --> 00:19:08.100
and ruthless political operation to accomplish his populist goals.

348
00:19:08.190 --> 00:19:12.600
I used to try to get things done by saying, please, he read and told the press.

349
00:19:12.810 --> 00:19:15.210
Now I dynamite and out of my path.

350
00:19:19.700 --> 00:19:20.533
<v 3>[Inaudible].</v>

351
00:19:21.440 --> 00:19:25.340
<v 0>Over the remainder of his term. Huey long, effectively transformed his status.</v>

352
00:19:25.341 --> 00:19:29.420
As governor into that of a local dictator, the ends will justify the means.

353
00:19:29.421 --> 00:19:32.960
He told people he continued replacing appointed officials all around city and

354
00:19:32.961 --> 00:19:36.530
state governments with populists that he felt were loyal supporters,

355
00:19:36.531 --> 00:19:37.430
whom he could trust.

356
00:19:37.520 --> 00:19:40.880
He also began a political ties that he called his war chest.

357
00:19:40.970 --> 00:19:44.030
Anyone who received a job from Huey was forced to give up a portion of their

358
00:19:44.031 --> 00:19:48.710
salary for a private funds that long kept locked away for either campaign needs

359
00:19:48.711 --> 00:19:50.090
or personal projects.

360
00:19:50.180 --> 00:19:53.240
Also surrounded himself with armed body guards at all times,

361
00:19:53.600 --> 00:19:56.900
impar for show and in part, because he had begun to receive death threats.

362
00:19:57.050 --> 00:19:58.430
It's an understandable reaction,

363
00:19:58.431 --> 00:20:01.160
but when you look like a strong man and walk around like a strong man,

364
00:20:01.310 --> 00:20:04.850
you start to act a little bit like one, two at one point it's a drunken long.

365
00:20:04.850 --> 00:20:08.120
Allegedly told one of his bodyguards to kill a state representative. Jay,

366
00:20:08.121 --> 00:20:09.350
why send his junior,

367
00:20:09.500 --> 00:20:13.940
leave him in a ditch where nobody will know where or how he got there long,

368
00:20:13.941 --> 00:20:17.900
still had lofty populist goals, but it also become an obvious autocrat.

369
00:20:17.920 --> 00:20:21.440
He was hell bent on amassing as much political power as possible.

370
00:20:21.500 --> 00:20:25.160
In 1930 with half his given national term still remaining.

371
00:20:25.310 --> 00:20:29.390
He decided to run for us Senate selling his campaign as a referendum on his

372
00:20:29.391 --> 00:20:33.260
political ideology. If you liked what he was doing for Louisiana,

373
00:20:33.440 --> 00:20:37.730
he asked that you also vote for him for Congress. If not, he would resign.

374
00:20:37.731 --> 00:20:40.850
The governorship long was running against a 72 year old incumbent.

375
00:20:40.851 --> 00:20:45.680
Senator Joseph ran cell of the constitutional league long routinely mocked as

376
00:20:45.681 --> 00:20:49.690
opponent declaring him may of the constipation league Q long,

377
00:20:49.691 --> 00:20:54.280
eventually won in a landslide in September of 1930, earning 57% of the vote,

378
00:20:54.460 --> 00:20:58.020
but long stayed in Louisiana. Fearful. Do you see the power here to mass,

379
00:20:58.150 --> 00:20:59.080
to as Lieutenant governor,

380
00:20:59.081 --> 00:21:02.260
by assuming his new congressional position in Washington,

381
00:21:02.320 --> 00:21:07.150
he presided over hellish state legislature sessions by screaming at those who

382
00:21:07.160 --> 00:21:11.830
disagreed with them, ordering them to sit down and shut up one night long,

383
00:21:11.831 --> 00:21:14.830
steam rolled 40 bills through the state house and under two hours,

384
00:21:15.070 --> 00:21:19.150
he had so thoroughly stacked to the state bureaucracy in his favor that no one

385
00:21:19.151 --> 00:21:21.070
could effectively speak against him.

386
00:21:21.100 --> 00:21:25.270
It was in these final dictatorial days as governor where long finally,

387
00:21:25.660 --> 00:21:29.440
and his infamous nickname ability school supporter dubbed him the King fish

388
00:21:29.470 --> 00:21:33.310
after a smooth talking character from a popular fictional radio program called

389
00:21:33.940 --> 00:21:37.510
and Andy, the name immediately stocked beloved by friends and foes alike,

390
00:21:37.511 --> 00:21:39.670
including long itself, long fended office,

391
00:21:39.671 --> 00:21:44.230
slow moving coup in 1931 when his own Lieutenant governor Paul Sayre announced

392
00:21:44.231 --> 00:21:47.440
that he did not believe long could be Senator and governor at the same time,

393
00:21:47.770 --> 00:21:50.470
Sarah declared himself to be the brightful governor of Louisiana,

394
00:21:50.471 --> 00:21:54.310
which regardless of whether he was right or wrong about the legality of longs

395
00:21:54.580 --> 00:21:56.830
dual statuses was a pretty stupid plan.

396
00:21:57.010 --> 00:21:59.650
Long had the national guard surrounds the state Capitol,

397
00:21:59.651 --> 00:22:02.980
and then I'd see her removed from the office by arguing to the state Supreme

398
00:22:02.981 --> 00:22:05.950
court that CEO had resigned his duly elected position.

399
00:22:05.951 --> 00:22:09.850
When he attempted to assume the governorship with Sierra gone long installed a

400
00:22:09.851 --> 00:22:11.530
puppet Alvin Alin King,

401
00:22:11.560 --> 00:22:15.400
who temporarily assumed the governorship as long left for Washington in 1932

402
00:22:15.820 --> 00:22:16.720
curious long-term puppet.

403
00:22:16.750 --> 00:22:20.710
Oscar Allen won the full job in the given national election of 1932,

404
00:22:20.920 --> 00:22:23.200
as long as settled into a senatorial duties,

405
00:22:23.230 --> 00:22:26.800
still completely in command of Louisiana state politics as long pivoted to

406
00:22:26.801 --> 00:22:27.700
national politics.

407
00:22:27.701 --> 00:22:32.470
He supported fellow progressive Franklin Delano Roosevelt during the election of

408
00:22:32.471 --> 00:22:33.221
1932,

409
00:22:33.221 --> 00:22:37.330
believing he was the only candidate with policies that could shepherd the U S

410
00:22:37.331 --> 00:22:38.350
through the depression.

411
00:22:38.620 --> 00:22:42.850
But after FTL one office long actually became a major critic of the new deal

412
00:22:42.851 --> 00:22:46.570
attacking Roosevelt's flagship legislative package from the left.

413
00:22:46.720 --> 00:22:50.470
He believed that FDR and his depression era policies were not doing enough to

414
00:22:50.471 --> 00:22:52.030
redistribute wealth in America.

415
00:22:52.060 --> 00:22:56.830
Roosevelt's intern labeled Huey long as a radical demagogue long spent his time

416
00:22:56.831 --> 00:22:57.400
in the Senate,

417
00:22:57.400 --> 00:23:01.030
advocating for free college tuition and seeding the ground for similar

418
00:23:01.031 --> 00:23:02.950
grassroots movements across America.

419
00:23:03.160 --> 00:23:06.700
That helped him rise to power in his own state. In February, 1934,

420
00:23:06.760 --> 00:23:10.060
he launched a radical initiative called the share our wealth campaign.

421
00:23:10.240 --> 00:23:14.680
This might still be the most radical left of center idea ever seriously,

422
00:23:14.710 --> 00:23:18.880
floated by a major American politician long wanted to cap personal annual

423
00:23:18.881 --> 00:23:23.080
incomes at a million dollars and cap personal fortunes at $50 million,

424
00:23:23.290 --> 00:23:24.490
the resulting tax income,

425
00:23:24.491 --> 00:23:28.750
which helped build a guaranteed household income for every American family along

426
00:23:28.751 --> 00:23:33.250
took care to remind Americans that 65% of the country's wealth was controlled by

427
00:23:33.430 --> 00:23:34.810
2% of the population.

428
00:23:34.930 --> 00:23:37.960
This plan would aggressively attempt to smooth those numbers out,

429
00:23:37.961 --> 00:23:41.230
offering every family a month, paid vacation, old age pension,

430
00:23:41.260 --> 00:23:45.830
and guaranteed that your long work week among other benefits, it was to be sure,

431
00:23:45.831 --> 00:23:48.440
but radical plan, even by new deal standards.

432
00:23:48.500 --> 00:23:51.500
When the U S Senate refused to seriously consider his proposal,

433
00:23:51.680 --> 00:23:54.920
he started a private society. The share our wealth society,

434
00:23:55.100 --> 00:23:58.100
which attracted more than 7 million members by 1935,

435
00:23:58.250 --> 00:24:01.640
unfortunately Huey long would not live long enough to reap the political

436
00:24:01.641 --> 00:24:04.970
benefits of his ideas. He published his first book, every man,

437
00:24:04.971 --> 00:24:09.770
a King in 1933 and had begun writing a second tome called my first days in the

438
00:24:09.771 --> 00:24:13.310
white house that made it pretty clear, whereas personal ambitions late,

439
00:24:13.340 --> 00:24:14.320
but on September the eighth,

440
00:24:14.340 --> 00:24:18.200
1935 long made his way to the Capitol building to vote on house.

441
00:24:18.201 --> 00:24:19.034
Bill number one,

442
00:24:19.190 --> 00:24:23.870
a rezoning plan whose met a goal was to ask the judge named Benjamin Henry Pavey

443
00:24:24.110 --> 00:24:26.630
that long considered a political opponent long.

444
00:24:26.740 --> 00:24:29.630
And his allies passed the bill Blake that night after 9:00 PM,

445
00:24:29.690 --> 00:24:30.523
shortly afterward,

446
00:24:30.890 --> 00:24:34.550
Patty's son-in-law called wise approach long and shot him one time.

447
00:24:34.850 --> 00:24:38.030
And the chest Weis died almost instantly after long,

448
00:24:38.120 --> 00:24:42.050
his body guards shot him more than 60 times long himself died at the hospital.

449
00:24:42.080 --> 00:24:45.740
More than 24 hours later after doctors were unable to successfully repair the

450
00:24:45.741 --> 00:24:47.090
internal damage to his body.

451
00:24:47.240 --> 00:24:50.120
There are conflicting reports over what his last words were,

452
00:24:50.121 --> 00:24:54.050
but one theory reports that they may have been, God don't let me die.

453
00:24:54.410 --> 00:24:55.370
I have so much to do.

454
00:24:55.910 --> 00:24:59.840
He was 42 long remains a controversial figure in American history because of the

455
00:24:59.841 --> 00:25:03.710
lengths he went to to consolidate power and advance the populous legislation.

456
00:25:04.010 --> 00:25:06.980
There is little doubt that he is a beloved figure in Louisiana,

457
00:25:07.040 --> 00:25:11.300
more than 200,000 people attended his funeral and his body was buried on the

458
00:25:11.301 --> 00:25:13.130
grounds of a new state Capitol building,

459
00:25:13.131 --> 00:25:16.430
which she directly helped fund with one of his tax initiatives.

460
00:25:16.490 --> 00:25:20.480
But outside of Louisiana on a national level long is often remembered for his

461
00:25:20.481 --> 00:25:24.110
authoritarians strategies and his radical economic initiatives,

462
00:25:24.290 --> 00:25:26.090
rather than a statewide benevolence.

463
00:25:26.150 --> 00:25:29.930
He took money by force and used it to improve the lives of blue collar

464
00:25:29.931 --> 00:25:30.764
Americans.

465
00:25:30.770 --> 00:25:35.210
And he scoffed the checks and balances that are designed to constrain political

466
00:25:35.211 --> 00:25:35.810
power.

467
00:25:35.810 --> 00:25:39.800
Huey long remains one of the ultimate American raw shack tasks for Machiavellian

468
00:25:39.801 --> 00:25:43.580
principles as long ones noses. The ends can justify the means,

469
00:25:43.760 --> 00:25:48.530
but that's an awfully dangerous mindset when your sworn enemies have pistols.
