<v 1>Yes.</v>

00:00:17.810 --> 00:00:21.020
<v 0>The fifth century BC represented the pinnacle of cultural,</v>

6
00:00:21.021 --> 00:00:24.230
political and economic power for the city state of Athens.

7
00:00:24.260 --> 00:00:27.530
It was a true golden age that would go on to have tremendous influence,

8
00:00:27.531 --> 00:00:31.280
not only on the Greek world, but on all of Western civilization.

9
00:00:31.340 --> 00:00:34.550
Socrates was laying down the foundations of Western philosophy,

10
00:00:34.640 --> 00:00:36.410
aided by students, such as Plato,

11
00:00:36.411 --> 00:00:40.790
as well as other prominent thinkers of that time in the answer Fenian dead,

12
00:00:40.791 --> 00:00:43.640
who was the envy of the Greek world. Thanks to the talented playwrights,

13
00:00:43.641 --> 00:00:47.180
such as you remedies a man named piteous cemented his position as the best

14
00:00:47.690 --> 00:00:51.350
sculptor in his time when he made the statue of Zeus at Olympia ranked among the

15
00:00:51.351 --> 00:00:52.940
seven wonders of the ancient world.

16
00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:57.170
Not to mention the fact that almost all of the structures located on the

17
00:00:57.171 --> 00:01:01.970
Acropolis most famously the pansy and were also built during this time.

18
00:01:02.060 --> 00:01:05.270
Other Athenians thought that history was important enough to be recorded for

19
00:01:05.271 --> 00:01:06.590
future generations. Here,

20
00:01:06.591 --> 00:01:09.680
we need an old friends of biographics who rolled it to us as well as through

21
00:01:09.681 --> 00:01:11.120
cities and Xenophon.

22
00:01:11.330 --> 00:01:15.380
The architect epidermis of Miletus was considered one of the founders of urban

23
00:01:15.381 --> 00:01:16.640
planning while Hippocrates,

24
00:01:16.670 --> 00:01:19.610
pioneered Western medicine and gave his name to the Hippocratic oath.

25
00:01:19.850 --> 00:01:24.440
All of these great people lived and worked in one place at one

26
00:01:24.441 --> 00:01:26.630
time. And then of course there was Paris, please.

27
00:01:26.690 --> 00:01:31.160
Sometimes the golden age of Athens is also called the age of paraklete because

28
00:01:31.250 --> 00:01:35.480
he was there to support and oversee it all. He was the city's leading statesmen,

29
00:01:35.481 --> 00:01:36.470
a skilled general,

30
00:01:36.471 --> 00:01:40.850
a patron of the arts and an operator without peers under his leadership,

31
00:01:40.851 --> 00:01:45.590
Athens flourished almost unlike any other city in history. It is no surprise.

32
00:01:45.591 --> 00:01:49.580
Then the paraklete became known as the first citizen of Athens.

33
00:01:56.150 --> 00:02:00.200
Eric Lees was born circa 495 BC in Athens. Of course,

34
00:02:00.260 --> 00:02:03.710
his father was a wealthy politician named Zen [inaudible] while his mother was

35
00:02:03.711 --> 00:02:06.350
named asterisk risk day and came from one of the oldest,

36
00:02:06.351 --> 00:02:09.860
most influential families in the city, according to Plutarch,

37
00:02:09.890 --> 00:02:12.440
who will serve as one of our primary ancient sources. Yeah,

38
00:02:12.650 --> 00:02:14.600
a few days before [inaudible] was born,

39
00:02:14.601 --> 00:02:18.320
his mother had a dream that she would give birth to a lion. Afterwards.

40
00:02:18.321 --> 00:02:21.830
The historian goes on to specify that even though Paris Glazer's personal

41
00:02:21.831 --> 00:02:23.630
appearance was unimpeachable,

42
00:02:23.720 --> 00:02:28.370
the Athenian apparently had quite a large and elongated heads. And for this,

43
00:02:28.371 --> 00:02:31.100
he was often the butt of the jokes of Greek poets.

44
00:02:31.130 --> 00:02:33.860
Plutarch's says that parrot leaders had looked like a squirrel,

45
00:02:33.861 --> 00:02:38.750
also known as a CNN onion and that he was sometimes called as the squeal hat,

46
00:02:38.900 --> 00:02:41.000
besides the unusual shape of his cranium.

47
00:02:41.001 --> 00:02:43.970
It was also said the paraklete is greatly resembled in appearance.

48
00:02:43.970 --> 00:02:45.710
A man named Peiser strata.

49
00:02:45.711 --> 00:02:49.520
So format tyrants of Athens who was not remembered fondly in his time,

50
00:02:49.550 --> 00:02:51.200
therefore as a youth paraklete is,

51
00:02:51.201 --> 00:02:54.920
did not enjoy speaking in public and instead focused on his military career,

52
00:02:55.100 --> 00:02:58.400
as he believed that it would be as big as calling it wasn't until he got a bit

53
00:02:58.401 --> 00:03:01.990
older, that it became more eager to enter the world of politics,

54
00:03:02.050 --> 00:03:03.730
given his family's high status,

55
00:03:03.731 --> 00:03:07.120
it comes as no surprise that young paraklete has benefited from a good

56
00:03:07.121 --> 00:03:09.540
education. Some of his known teachers included PIF.

57
00:03:09.541 --> 00:03:11.800
The client is who taught him music Xeno,

58
00:03:11.801 --> 00:03:15.700
who taught him on the natural world and his most beloved to you to an exact her

59
00:03:15.850 --> 00:03:17.500
as who taught him about philosophy,

60
00:03:17.560 --> 00:03:22.060
despite his privileged childhood paraklete you saw firsthand how fleeting power

61
00:03:22.061 --> 00:03:23.470
can be when he was around 10,

62
00:03:23.471 --> 00:03:27.940
his family status was almost wiped out when his father [inaudible] was

63
00:03:27.941 --> 00:03:32.320
ostracized back then ostracism didn't just mean that he got left out of the

64
00:03:32.321 --> 00:03:33.310
Athenian politics.

65
00:03:33.340 --> 00:03:37.630
This was an official procedure that resulted in a 10 year exile from the city.

66
00:03:37.810 --> 00:03:38.890
However, in this case,

67
00:03:38.891 --> 00:03:42.220
it only lasted a few years until the Persians invaded Greece. Again,

68
00:03:42.280 --> 00:03:46.060
as one of Athens's most capable military leaders and flippers was recalled in

69
00:03:46.061 --> 00:03:46.930
defense of the city.

70
00:03:47.200 --> 00:03:50.860
He acquitted himself very well when he led the Athenian Navy in the battle of

71
00:03:50.861 --> 00:03:53.560
Mike Hall and 479 BC.

72
00:03:53.680 --> 00:03:57.400
It was a decisive victory for the Greeks and with another triumph at black Taher

73
00:03:57.580 --> 00:03:59.050
and marks at the end of the second,

74
00:03:59.110 --> 00:04:02.470
the Persian invasion is that a tip has only lived for a few more years after

75
00:04:02.471 --> 00:04:02.860
that,

76
00:04:02.860 --> 00:04:07.150
but he died a hero of Athens and ensured that his son would be welcomed into the

77
00:04:07.151 --> 00:04:09.550
city's political world with open arms.

78
00:04:15.570 --> 00:04:15.870
<v 1>[Inaudible].</v>

79
00:04:15.870 --> 00:04:18.930
<v 0>Before we get into the details of how [inaudible] Rose to power,</v>

80
00:04:18.931 --> 00:04:22.380
we should try to get some backgrounds on the reeling political classes in

81
00:04:22.381 --> 00:04:23.070
Athens.

82
00:04:23.070 --> 00:04:27.570
There are basically two groups that we need to discuss the [inaudible] and the

83
00:04:27.571 --> 00:04:28.410
strata guy.

84
00:04:28.500 --> 00:04:32.640
They all cones where the chief magistrates of Athens and other Greek cities.

85
00:04:32.641 --> 00:04:36.060
And they had been around for hundreds of years before the age of Paris Lees.

86
00:04:36.120 --> 00:04:39.090
Basically whenever Athens was not ruled by a King or a tire,

87
00:04:39.091 --> 00:04:43.140
and it was ruled by these icons who usually came in three,

88
00:04:43.141 --> 00:04:47.820
the eponymous arc on the parlor, Mark and the arc on base ileus.

89
00:04:47.880 --> 00:04:50.100
The lengths of their office terms vary greatly,

90
00:04:50.101 --> 00:04:53.280
depending on the exact time period, we're talking about a first,

91
00:04:53.281 --> 00:04:56.310
they ruled for life. Then they were limited to 10 years, and finally,

92
00:04:56.430 --> 00:04:59.430
they were restricted to a single year with the emergence of democracy,

93
00:04:59.431 --> 00:05:02.850
the power and influence of the icons diminished greatly. In fact,

94
00:05:02.851 --> 00:05:03.900
by the time of paraklete,

95
00:05:03.930 --> 00:05:08.160
the office of arc-on was mainly ceremonial with just a few minor civic

96
00:05:08.161 --> 00:05:12.150
responsibilities. The authority was now in the hands of the strata guy,

97
00:05:12.210 --> 00:05:16.050
generally speaking, uh, strata gossip simply means a military leader,

98
00:05:16.110 --> 00:05:19.920
sort of the ancient Greek version of a general. However, in fifth century,

99
00:05:19.921 --> 00:05:20.491
Athens,

100
00:05:20.491 --> 00:05:25.260
that was a board always consisting of 10 strata guy who were in charge of

101
00:05:25.290 --> 00:05:27.360
all the important duties of the city.

102
00:05:27.450 --> 00:05:30.750
While other positions like that of argon were assigned by drawing lots.

103
00:05:30.751 --> 00:05:32.880
The strata guy elected every year,

104
00:05:33.060 --> 00:05:37.140
all strata guy were technically of equal rankings, made decisions through vote.

105
00:05:37.170 --> 00:05:38.550
However, as you might expect,

106
00:05:38.551 --> 00:05:42.630
some were considerably more influential than the rest and their opinion carries.

107
00:05:42.740 --> 00:05:43.650
<v 1>There's a lot more weight.</v>

108
00:05:50.400 --> 00:05:53.130
<v 0>Let's get back to Paris, please. Hands in the political world of Athens.</v>

109
00:05:53.131 --> 00:05:56.130
When he was in his early twenties, the earliest recorded act of his,

110
00:05:56.131 --> 00:05:58.460
his data to four and 72 BC.

111
00:05:58.461 --> 00:06:02.990
When he sponsored a play by [inaudible] called the Persians. In this case,

112
00:06:03.680 --> 00:06:06.980
[inaudible] was a Korogocho so rich citizen of Athens who paid for the

113
00:06:06.981 --> 00:06:09.470
production of a play, whether he wanted to or not,

114
00:06:09.530 --> 00:06:12.680
these roles were usually assigned. And in fact,

115
00:06:12.681 --> 00:06:16.040
represented one of the few duties still performed by the Arcons.

116
00:06:16.070 --> 00:06:17.240
But in this case,

117
00:06:17.241 --> 00:06:21.500
it is believed para glees wanted to sponsor this particular play in order to

118
00:06:21.501 --> 00:06:25.430
send a message. Like we said, even though all stranded guy were equal in rank,

119
00:06:25.431 --> 00:06:28.190
some were more equal than others. At this time,

120
00:06:28.191 --> 00:06:30.800
the leadership of Athens was divided between two factions.

121
00:06:30.830 --> 00:06:34.930
One led by them historically is the other by SIM on the plays sponsored by

122
00:06:35.840 --> 00:06:38.500
[inaudible]. The battle of Salem is where the Greeks led by them.

123
00:06:38.990 --> 00:06:39.351
Stokley's defeated.

124
00:06:39.351 --> 00:06:43.520
The Persians people regarded this as paraklete was officially siding with him in

125
00:06:43.521 --> 00:06:46.160
his power struggle against Simone. Unfortunately,

126
00:06:46.340 --> 00:06:48.020
if apparently is he chose poorly.

127
00:06:48.110 --> 00:06:51.440
The list of enemies for [inaudible] was growing larger and larger.

128
00:06:51.441 --> 00:06:55.670
And it included all of spotter who were very friendly with Simone eventually

129
00:06:55.671 --> 00:07:00.080
after multiple accusations, then Mr. CLIs was ostracized and exiles.

130
00:07:00.130 --> 00:07:03.790
That wasn't enough for Sparta though, which accused the former war hero,

131
00:07:04.660 --> 00:07:09.430
aiding a Spartan conspiracy plot and wanted him try to buy all the Greek cities,

132
00:07:09.460 --> 00:07:12.640
not just Athens, since this likely meant a death sentence,

133
00:07:12.641 --> 00:07:16.840
that must darkly was forced to leave the whole of Greece and of all places he

134
00:07:16.841 --> 00:07:20.740
ended up in Persia, which was now led by King asters axes. The first,

135
00:07:20.741 --> 00:07:23.350
the son of the man that the mystically is defeated in battle.

136
00:07:23.380 --> 00:07:26.380
So fortunately for him, the King was not interested in revenge of anything.

137
00:07:26.890 --> 00:07:30.400
He was happy to have one of his father's most capable foes in his service,

138
00:07:30.730 --> 00:07:33.820
the exiled Greek relocated to the prosperous city of magnesia,

139
00:07:33.850 --> 00:07:37.600
where he was named governor and where he spent the rest of his days back in

140
00:07:37.601 --> 00:07:40.960
Athens paraclese was steadily growing in power and winning over the people.

141
00:07:41.110 --> 00:07:41.590
However,

142
00:07:41.590 --> 00:07:45.520
he still had a major obstacle in the form of SIM on like a pair of Oakleys.

143
00:07:45.550 --> 00:07:48.400
He was the son of a beloved war hero. In this case, it was Milt.

144
00:07:48.790 --> 00:07:52.120
Yardi is the man who led Greece to victory at the battle of marathon. However,

145
00:07:52.150 --> 00:07:53.950
someone was also himself,

146
00:07:53.980 --> 00:07:57.640
a distinguished military veteran known for his triumph for the battle of Euro

147
00:07:57.641 --> 00:07:58.030
metal.

148
00:07:58.030 --> 00:08:01.450
He was also richer than America and could afford to be more generous in his

149
00:08:01.451 --> 00:08:03.790
spending in order to win the affections of the public.

150
00:08:03.970 --> 00:08:08.800
It seems like someone had the clear advantage, but fortunes are often fleeting.

151
00:08:09.220 --> 00:08:13.030
All pricklies had to do was wait for the opportune moment to strike against his

152
00:08:13.540 --> 00:08:15.220
opponent and destroy his public standing.

153
00:08:15.310 --> 00:08:18.790
He first acted on some rumors that someone had taken bribes from Alexander.

154
00:08:18.791 --> 00:08:22.240
The first of Mastodon, no, that's not the famous one. And who knows,

155
00:08:22.241 --> 00:08:24.850
maybe paraclese even started the rumors himself. Yeah.

156
00:08:24.940 --> 00:08:28.150
The important thing is that they allowed him to formally charge his rival with

157
00:08:28.180 --> 00:08:31.870
bribery. And even though someone was quit, it it's still attacked.

158
00:08:31.871 --> 00:08:35.770
His credibility. That being said Simone's full was ultimately of his own doing.

159
00:08:35.980 --> 00:08:39.610
As we said, he was close to spot up. In fact, he acted as that proxy.

160
00:08:40.060 --> 00:08:43.930
NASSA sort of ambassador and advocated for a close relationship between the two

161
00:08:43.931 --> 00:08:48.340
powerful Greek States in 462 BC spotter experience to halite

162
00:08:48.400 --> 00:08:52.390
rebellion. They had lots being the lower class of Spartan society.

163
00:08:52.390 --> 00:08:54.280
Similar to medieval serfs.

164
00:08:54.310 --> 00:08:58.380
Someone believed that sending soldiers to aid spotter would help cement the bond

165
00:08:58.381 --> 00:08:58.980
between them.

166
00:08:58.980 --> 00:09:02.070
Other leaders were not so eager with the Persians out of the picture.

167
00:09:02.100 --> 00:09:06.420
They saw a spot for what it truly was their main competitor and biggest threat,

168
00:09:06.510 --> 00:09:08.430
even. So Tim on convinced everyone,

169
00:09:08.431 --> 00:09:12.000
and he personally led thousands of troops to spot it. When he arrived, though,

170
00:09:12.001 --> 00:09:16.170
he received a very unpleasant surprise. The Spartans did not want them. In fact,

171
00:09:16.171 --> 00:09:20.100
the last thing they needed was for the HELOCs learn about that Athenian

172
00:09:20.101 --> 00:09:20.730
democracy.

173
00:09:20.730 --> 00:09:24.240
Simone was turned back and touch a return to Athens completely humiliated.

174
00:09:24.360 --> 00:09:29.160
Afterwards. Barclays had no difficulty in getting someone ostracized in 461 BC.

175
00:09:29.460 --> 00:09:33.120
And he was exiled for 10 years with the opposition gone barricades as party.

176
00:09:33.180 --> 00:09:35.280
It was the most powerful political entity in Athens,

177
00:09:35.310 --> 00:09:38.610
but it was not led by Paris, please. Not yet. Anyway,

178
00:09:38.640 --> 00:09:42.090
it was lands by its senior member and a Menzer of paraklete is a man named Def

179
00:09:42.780 --> 00:09:42.930
realities.

180
00:09:42.930 --> 00:09:46.770
He began in acting reforms to restrict the power of Athenian oligarchs and to

181
00:09:47.310 --> 00:09:49.380
expand the democratic privileges of the citizens.

182
00:09:49.560 --> 00:09:53.250
But he didn't get to see his policies in action as he was assassinated that same

183
00:09:53.251 --> 00:09:55.350
yet. Nobody knew who did the deed.

184
00:09:55.360 --> 00:09:59.940
So obviously enemies of [inaudible] accused the Athenian of killing his

185
00:09:59.941 --> 00:10:04.140
Menza to take over his position. Such accusations were considered baseless.

186
00:10:04.320 --> 00:10:04.771
But if talk,

187
00:10:04.771 --> 00:10:09.660
for example said that they were held as if so much venom against one who had a

188
00:10:10.050 --> 00:10:14.400
noble disposition and an ambitious spirit wherein no such Savage and beast,

189
00:10:14.401 --> 00:10:16.650
your feelings can have to reboot.

190
00:10:17.070 --> 00:10:19.380
He also mentioned squashing Aristotle as his source,

191
00:10:19.381 --> 00:10:22.770
that the killer of FLTs was a man named Arysta Deckers.

192
00:10:22.980 --> 00:10:26.880
Tenara who he was, why he did it in time. Aristotle came to learn of him.

193
00:10:26.881 --> 00:10:29.310
We have no idea lost a history,

194
00:10:29.340 --> 00:10:32.790
but the point is this with the leader of the opposition Maxalt and the leader of

195
00:10:32.791 --> 00:10:36.920
his own party dead paraclese was now able to connect Solidated power and become

196
00:10:36.921 --> 00:10:41.480
the most powerful man in Athens, a position that he would meet until his death.

197
00:10:41.510 --> 00:10:43.750
Now, just before we continue with the rest of today's video,

198
00:10:43.820 --> 00:10:46.460
do you want to take a quick moment to tell you about our fantastic sponsor?

199
00:10:46.700 --> 00:10:51.260
Then Sarah has been Sarah create exceptionally crafted timepieces, uh,

200
00:10:51.280 --> 00:10:55.100
fair prices, these watches they're great looking pieces.

201
00:10:55.270 --> 00:10:57.410
That's certainly not mentalist and taking it off now.

202
00:10:57.411 --> 00:10:59.240
So you can have a look at it.

203
00:10:59.330 --> 00:11:02.900
They have a bowls and distinct look.

204
00:11:02.930 --> 00:11:05.960
This is their take on the pilot watch. It's an altitude watch.

205
00:11:05.961 --> 00:11:10.190
It's got this nice red second hand. Yeah. Nice big face,

206
00:11:10.220 --> 00:11:14.390
very easily readable, uh, numbers. And also, so it's got dual time.

207
00:11:14.410 --> 00:11:16.870
So you can set it to two time zones, which is fantastic.

208
00:11:16.920 --> 00:11:20.000
Got another one over here. This is zero,

209
00:11:20.060 --> 00:11:24.050
which is a bit more of a traditional looking watch has got this great clasp

210
00:11:24.380 --> 00:11:29.030
strap. You just pop that on the wrist, just like that. And it looks fantastic.

These are watches that people will notice that compliment you on. Like I say,

a couple of them actually got a third one, which I don't have with me right now,

213

221
00:12:08.070 --> 00:12:08.130
<v 1>[Inaudible].</v>

222
00:12:08.130 --> 00:12:11.250
<v 0>When Porsche first began its invasion of the Greek cities at the start of the</v>

223
00:12:11.251 --> 00:12:11.941
fifth century,

224
00:12:11.941 --> 00:12:16.500
BC Sparta was the unofficial that's uncontested leader of the Greek forces.

225
00:12:16.590 --> 00:12:20.220
After Sparta came its close allies who were part of the Peloponnesian league,

226
00:12:20.250 --> 00:12:24.600
a group of city States all located in or around the Peloponnese peninsula.

227
00:12:24.660 --> 00:12:28.050
These included Corinth, alias, pilots, and others. Finally,

228
00:12:28.051 --> 00:12:31.200
there were the rest of the Greek States that would probably not have been allies

229
00:12:31.201 --> 00:12:33.810
if they were not fighting a common foe. The Persians,

230
00:12:34.050 --> 00:12:37.770
these last States came to resent spotter mainly due to two factors.

231
00:12:37.890 --> 00:12:38.640
For starters,

232
00:12:38.640 --> 00:12:41.910
Naval warfare ended up becoming a very important factor in the Wars.

233
00:12:41.940 --> 00:12:46.290
Sparta did not have a strong Navy, not as powerful as Athens, for instance,

234
00:12:46.291 --> 00:12:48.660
or Argus or Carlos or kiosk.

235
00:12:48.690 --> 00:12:52.410
Therefore these Naval powers weren't happy that their status in the Alliance

236
00:12:52.411 --> 00:12:55.470
didn't quite match up to the contribution that they were bringing to the war.

237
00:12:55.530 --> 00:12:59.130
Even more contentious though, was the idea of a Greek counter attack.

238
00:12:59.190 --> 00:13:01.380
After the victories at Mike Allen plus Taya,

239
00:13:01.381 --> 00:13:05.820
the invasion of mainland Greece was over and as far as Sparta was concerned,

240
00:13:05.910 --> 00:13:09.600
so it was the war. The Greeks won the Persians left job done,

241
00:13:09.720 --> 00:13:13.440
but other city States like Athens wanted to keep the pressure on and go into

242
00:13:13.441 --> 00:13:16.230
Asia minor and liberate the Ionian Greek States,

243
00:13:16.231 --> 00:13:20.190
which were still under Persian control and have been for almost a hundred years

244
00:13:20.310 --> 00:13:23.520
since they were conquered by Cyrus. The great at this point,

245
00:13:23.550 --> 00:13:27.180
Sparta and its ghost allies withdrew from the war and the leadership of the

246
00:13:27.181 --> 00:13:31.260
remaining Greek States was passed onto me. Athens informed turned 78 BC.

247
00:13:31.261 --> 00:13:34.200
They even formed their own association called the DeLeon league.

248
00:13:34.230 --> 00:13:36.230
The name came from the Island of Del Los,

249
00:13:36.231 --> 00:13:40.200
which acted as a neutral meeting point for all of the members and also serves as

250
00:13:40.201 --> 00:13:42.120
the next treasury. Even in ancient times,

251
00:13:42.660 --> 00:13:45.240
historians such as the use of diabetes regarded the counter attack on the

252
00:13:45.241 --> 00:13:49.290
Persian empire is just a pretext to form this league without any opposition.

253
00:13:49.440 --> 00:13:52.800
The main goal was to protect its members from all future enemies.

254
00:13:52.801 --> 00:13:56.460
And although never stated it was clearly intended to counteract spotters

255
00:13:56.490 --> 00:13:57.630
Peloponnesian league.

256
00:13:57.660 --> 00:14:01.140
From this point on Athens as power and influence in the Greek world,

257
00:14:01.141 --> 00:14:05.010
steadily grew to the displeasure of sparked up over the following decades.

258
00:14:05.011 --> 00:14:07.410
The relationship between the two States became tense,

259
00:14:07.440 --> 00:14:09.630
even though it was still outwardly friendly.

260
00:14:09.690 --> 00:14:13.560
One important moments came when Athens rebuilt its walls in secrets under the

261
00:14:13.561 --> 00:14:17.910
direction of [inaudible] spotter insisted that no Greek cities should build

262
00:14:17.911 --> 00:14:21.450
walls under the pretense that they would provide fortifications for a foreign

263
00:14:21.451 --> 00:14:25.500
invader. If they took over the city, of course, what others took this to mean?

264
00:14:25.501 --> 00:14:26.760
Was that Sparta preferred it.

265
00:14:26.790 --> 00:14:30.480
If the rest of the Greek States relied on them for protection, well,

266
00:14:30.481 --> 00:14:34.230
bathrooms didn't listen to Sparta ruins. Not only did they build their walls,

267
00:14:34.260 --> 00:14:38.430
they also declared themselves free of spot unhedged Germany capable of defending

268
00:14:38.431 --> 00:14:39.870
themselves over the years,

269
00:14:39.871 --> 00:14:44.280
the deli and league slowly but surely turned into an unofficial Athenian empire

270
00:14:44.430 --> 00:14:45.420
since its inception.

271
00:14:45.450 --> 00:14:48.630
Each member was expected to provide an annual tribute in the form of either

272
00:14:48.631 --> 00:14:52.370
money or soldiers or weapons with no Wars on the horizon.

273
00:14:52.371 --> 00:14:53.720
Most members chose to pay,

274
00:14:53.721 --> 00:14:57.740
but Athens instead kept touting soldiers to the forces of the DeLeon league.

275
00:14:57.770 --> 00:14:59.030
After a couple of decades,

276
00:14:59.031 --> 00:15:02.840
the bulk of the league's army consisted almost entirely of Athenian soldiers.

277
00:15:02.841 --> 00:15:07.760
So in reality, the other members were basically paying Athens to keep them safe.

278
00:15:07.850 --> 00:15:09.360
This continued under paraklete,

279
00:15:09.470 --> 00:15:12.740
who was eager to keep increasing the hegemony of Athens over the deli and leak.

280
00:15:12.920 --> 00:15:15.830
At one point, he refused to accept any more soldiers or supplies,

281
00:15:15.950 --> 00:15:19.520
his tribute instead, insisting that everyone pay money. The true turning point,

282
00:15:19.521 --> 00:15:24.050
however occurred in 454 BC when [inaudible] moved the treasury of the DeLeon

283
00:15:24.051 --> 00:15:26.540
league from the Island of Del Los to Athens,

284
00:15:26.690 --> 00:15:30.440
he did it under the pretense that the money was safer in Athens, but in reality,

285
00:15:30.441 --> 00:15:33.410
he used it to fund his own building projects. This was bad for them,

286
00:15:33.411 --> 00:15:37.400
but great for us and great for history as a whole because paraclese his most

287
00:15:37.401 --> 00:15:41.270
ambitious construction plan was to rebuild the Acropolis of Athens.

288
00:15:41.360 --> 00:15:44.060
Thanks to him. The city got its marvelous structures.

289
00:15:44.090 --> 00:15:47.480
His spending ways were not always well-received in Athens. In fact,

290
00:15:47.510 --> 00:15:51.590
they often represent the main criticism apparently is by his political opponents

291
00:15:51.620 --> 00:15:54.680
during the four forties, the other political parties started gaining power.

292
00:15:54.681 --> 00:15:58.640
Again, led by a man named [inaudible] is not to be confused with the historian.

293
00:15:58.820 --> 00:16:02.780
The statesman wanted to have [inaudible] ostracized for playing fast and loose

294
00:16:02.781 --> 00:16:06.770
with public funds and for a while, got the Athenian people on his side. However,

295
00:16:06.890 --> 00:16:09.110
in an example of Supreme oratorical skill,

296
00:16:09.230 --> 00:16:11.510
Patrick Lee's managed to win back the public.

297
00:16:11.540 --> 00:16:14.900
He even said that he would pay for the construction from his own pocket.

298
00:16:14.901 --> 00:16:17.630
As long as the inscriptions were dedicated to him alone,

299
00:16:17.660 --> 00:16:21.680
the Magnum entity of his offer was enough to sway the Athenians public spending

300
00:16:21.681 --> 00:16:25.610
continued as before all throughs of diabetes was himself ostracized and exiled,

301
00:16:26.240 --> 00:16:27.110
empirically state empowered.

302
00:16:33.640 --> 00:16:34.090
<v 1>Ever since.</v>

303
00:16:34.090 --> 00:16:36.790
<v 0>And started gaining power and influence in the Greek world.</v>

304
00:16:36.791 --> 00:16:39.460
It was only a matter of time before it would collide with Sparta,

305
00:16:39.640 --> 00:16:44.230
which did not want any other city state to rival its strength, the air 460 BC.

306
00:16:44.231 --> 00:16:47.740
So the outbreak of the first Peloponnesian war between Athens and Sparta,

307
00:16:47.950 --> 00:16:50.350
as well as their allies, just for added clarity though,

308
00:16:50.380 --> 00:16:53.950
this is not the same as the more famous conflicts known simply as the

309
00:16:53.951 --> 00:16:56.350
Peloponnesian war, which we'll talk about in a bit,

310
00:16:56.500 --> 00:16:59.500
technically that should have been named the second Peloponnesian war,

311
00:16:59.560 --> 00:17:02.890
but because it was much granted lasted longer and it had much more significant

312
00:17:02.891 --> 00:17:04.090
historical consequences.

313
00:17:04.300 --> 00:17:08.950
It became just known as the Peloponnesian war ignoring the underlying tensions

314
00:17:08.951 --> 00:17:09.784
in the Greek world.

315
00:17:09.790 --> 00:17:13.720
This war ostensibly broke out due to a border dispute between McGarrah and

316
00:17:13.721 --> 00:17:18.400
currents in 460 BC McGarren left the Peloponnesian league and requested to

317
00:17:18.401 --> 00:17:19.930
join the Delian league.

318
00:17:19.960 --> 00:17:22.990
This caused conflict between Athens and Corinth through where the initial

319
00:17:22.991 --> 00:17:26.890
belligerence of the first Peloponnesian war with Sparta only intervening on

320
00:17:26.891 --> 00:17:30.730
occasion paraclese was reluctant to engage in an all-out battle with the

321
00:17:30.731 --> 00:17:33.910
Peloponnese forces because his army was spread far and wide,

322
00:17:33.911 --> 00:17:35.770
still aiding other nations in Asia,

323
00:17:35.771 --> 00:17:38.440
minor in Egypt who were rebelling against the Persians.

324
00:17:38.620 --> 00:17:42.250
He engaged the Corinthians several times and eventually managed to drive them

325
00:17:42.251 --> 00:17:43.840
out of McGarrah. Meanwhile,

326
00:17:44.320 --> 00:17:46.900
Sparta spent the first few years of the war avoiding Athens.

327
00:17:47.080 --> 00:17:49.770
Instead they battled focuses a senior,

328
00:17:49.860 --> 00:17:53.220
an ally who themselves were in conflict with the neighboring state of Doris.

329
00:17:53.280 --> 00:17:56.400
Their goal appeared to be to conquer or submit all the city States and the

330
00:17:56.401 --> 00:17:59.760
region of Bo OTO and unify them under one leadership.

331
00:17:59.790 --> 00:18:04.440
It wasn't until 457 BC that Sparta and Athens finally met in

332
00:18:04.441 --> 00:18:08.220
battle a to Nagra according to [inaudible] the Spartans one,

333
00:18:08.221 --> 00:18:11.040
but the slaughter was great on both sides,

334
00:18:11.070 --> 00:18:15.180
so they could not press on the attack and stamps or retreat, the Athenians,

335
00:18:15.181 --> 00:18:17.520
however, managed to regroup. And just a few months later,

336
00:18:17.521 --> 00:18:20.430
they soundly defeated all the Spartan allies in the area,

337
00:18:20.580 --> 00:18:23.730
putting a stop to spotters plan of consolidating power.

338
00:18:24.540 --> 00:18:28.230
Barclays had the advantage because it went away in 454 BC.

339
00:18:28.260 --> 00:18:29.370
Thanks to the punishments.

340
00:18:29.460 --> 00:18:32.760
Like we previously mentioned a large part of the Athenian army was still

341
00:18:32.761 --> 00:18:33.810
assisting other nations,

342
00:18:33.811 --> 00:18:36.600
trying to escape the subjugation of the Academy at empire,

343
00:18:36.750 --> 00:18:41.220
the Delian league had sent 200 ships to Egypt to help a rebel leader called in

344
00:18:41.790 --> 00:18:41.820
Aras.

345
00:18:41.820 --> 00:18:46.050
The expedition ended in disaster for Athens following the siege of pro sepsis,

346
00:18:46.080 --> 00:18:49.620
as most of their fleet was destroyed while enormous was captured and crucified.

347
00:18:49.800 --> 00:18:53.400
This may have forced a peace treaty between Athens and Persian known as the

348
00:18:53.401 --> 00:18:55.470
peace of Cali as more or less.

349
00:18:55.530 --> 00:18:58.980
It said that Persia would leave the Greek cities in Asia, minor alone,

350
00:18:58.981 --> 00:19:01.230
but Athens had to stay out of North Africa,

351
00:19:01.290 --> 00:19:05.280
the disaster of the Egyptian campaign and serious repercussions for Athens as it

352
00:19:05.281 --> 00:19:06.600
lost its Naval supremacy.

353
00:19:06.660 --> 00:19:09.060
Not only was it threatened by the Peloponnesian league,

354
00:19:09.090 --> 00:19:13.110
but also by Greek cities from the Delian league who wanted to rebel this

355
00:19:13.111 --> 00:19:14.580
culminated in another defeated,

356
00:19:14.581 --> 00:19:19.320
the battle of Caronia in 447 BC against the boat ocean city States that

357
00:19:19.530 --> 00:19:23.700
Athens had previously submitted from this point on paraclese decided mostly to

358
00:19:23.701 --> 00:19:27.840
stay away from mainland Greece affairs and to focus his efforts on the Jian

359
00:19:27.841 --> 00:19:30.660
where Athens was most dominant as a prize appearance,

360
00:19:30.700 --> 00:19:34.680
it was made by SIM on once the main political rival of paraclese has Xcel was

361
00:19:34.860 --> 00:19:38.940
up. So he returned to Athens in 451 BC still on good terms with spotter.

362
00:19:38.970 --> 00:19:42.120
He first negotiated a temporary truce between the two powers,

363
00:19:42.121 --> 00:19:47.070
which eventually culminated in the 30 years of peace of 446 BC of

364
00:19:47.071 --> 00:19:49.110
us ending the first Peloponnesian war.

365
00:19:55.850 --> 00:19:56.683
<v 2>[Inaudible].</v>

366
00:19:56.720 --> 00:19:58.520
<v 0>As a name is a 30 years piece.</v>

367
00:19:58.700 --> 00:20:02.900
It did not last three decades and nobody was expecting it to over the next 15

368
00:20:02.901 --> 00:20:06.230
years. Athens and Sparta continued to act aggressively to one another,

369
00:20:06.231 --> 00:20:10.790
but they did it by proxy, by finding cause to attack each other as allies.

370
00:20:10.850 --> 00:20:15.500
The most notable example of this was the sameon war of 440 BC Athens

371
00:20:15.530 --> 00:20:18.650
intervened in a conflict between Samos and Miletus,

372
00:20:18.740 --> 00:20:21.500
even though Samos was a member of the deli and leagues,

373
00:20:21.501 --> 00:20:23.900
the city reportedly asked spot of a help,

374
00:20:24.140 --> 00:20:27.440
the Spartans seriously considered going to war against Athens again,

375
00:20:27.441 --> 00:20:32.060
but backed out when corn's not joining them since they needed the Corinthian

376
00:20:32.061 --> 00:20:34.940
fleet. As the only Naval power of the Peloponnesian league,

377
00:20:35.000 --> 00:20:38.480
strangely the same cities that were involved in the outbreak of the first

378
00:20:38.481 --> 00:20:42.320
Peloponnesian war again played important roles [inaudible] which was once more

379
00:20:42.321 --> 00:20:45.620
in our lives. Sparta had angered Athens by denigrating.

380
00:20:45.621 --> 00:20:49.600
One of its Holy sites in directly is that issued the McGarren decree,

381
00:20:49.601 --> 00:20:53.560
banning the guardian ships merchants from all markets imports of the deli and

382
00:20:53.561 --> 00:20:58.000
league. It was the ancient Athenian version of a trade embargo. Meanwhile,

383
00:20:58.360 --> 00:21:01.570
Nathans also got involved in a dispute between Corinth and one of its colonies

384
00:21:01.571 --> 00:21:05.620
names, cos Syrah. This is today known as Corfu conversantly current,

385
00:21:05.680 --> 00:21:08.170
the secretly aged eight different colony named Potter day,

386
00:21:08.260 --> 00:21:11.020
or with soldiers and weapons and a battle against Athens.

387
00:21:11.050 --> 00:21:14.920
These were all considered to go against the terms of the 30 year peace and in

388
00:21:14.921 --> 00:21:19.120
431 BC the Peloponnesian league led by Spartan gang academics.

389
00:21:19.121 --> 00:21:21.160
The second declared war and Athens, once more,

390
00:21:21.190 --> 00:21:24.580
perfectly as a strategy was to play to his strengths as much as possible.

391
00:21:24.670 --> 00:21:28.270
Athens dominated the waters, Sparta was unmatched on lands.

392
00:21:28.390 --> 00:21:31.720
He knew that the enemy would come to ravage his territories,

393
00:21:31.750 --> 00:21:33.880
but decided to avoid an open battle.

394
00:21:33.940 --> 00:21:36.970
Instead he relocated his people to the safety of Athens itself.

395
00:21:36.971 --> 00:21:39.430
And while the Spartan army was pillaging his farms,

396
00:21:39.431 --> 00:21:42.340
he took his Navy and plundered the Peloponnesian coasts.

397
00:21:42.520 --> 00:21:45.940
Unfortunately we cannot see the panel Polynesian war to its conclusion because

398
00:21:45.970 --> 00:21:50.830
well, neither paraklete in 429 BC, just two years off to the start of the war,

399
00:21:50.920 --> 00:21:53.380
the mighty statesman and half of his family.

400
00:21:53.530 --> 00:21:56.110
What guilds by a plague that ravaged the city of Athens,

401
00:21:56.320 --> 00:22:00.640
the Peloponnesian war lasted for another 25 years and resulted in a definitive

402
00:22:00.641 --> 00:22:04.720
spot and victory, thus bringing an end to the golden age of Athens,

403
00:22:05.020 --> 00:22:09.340
