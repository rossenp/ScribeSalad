00:00:00.300 --> 00:00:03.270
<v 0>For pal horseman wrote in from East Dawn,</v>

2
00:00:03.330 --> 00:00:06.660
they were Scouts from the red army Vanguard chasing the invaders all the way

3
00:00:06.661 --> 00:00:10.680
back to Germany. It was the 27th of January, 1945 behind the Bob's,

4
00:00:10.950 --> 00:00:13.920
why they found 9,000 prisoners left to die by the SS.

5
00:00:14.010 --> 00:00:18.270
That place was called Auschwitz among the survivors, a young Italian,

6
00:00:18.510 --> 00:00:22.140
he had been arrested because he was a resistance fighter and a Jew.

7
00:00:22.350 --> 00:00:24.570
He survived because he was a chemist.

8
00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:28.650
He was named Primo levy and he would become one of the most important writers of

9
00:00:28.651 --> 00:00:29.580
the 20th century.

10
00:00:29.930 --> 00:00:30.763
<v 1>Sorry.</v>

11
00:00:42.710 --> 00:00:45.770
<v 0>He was born in here in Northern Italy on the 31st of July,</v>

12
00:00:45.771 --> 00:00:50.480
1919 to Jewish parents, esta and Cesari premier inherited from treasury,

13
00:00:50.481 --> 00:00:54.470
a love for reading, for science, for exploring the why's of life.

14
00:00:54.620 --> 00:00:55.820
But as the ends of puberty,

15
00:00:55.850 --> 00:00:59.960
the studious and introverted premier found himself in conflict with his more

16
00:00:59.990 --> 00:01:03.800
outgoing father. She has a Ray encouraged his son to drink smoke,

17
00:01:04.010 --> 00:01:05.240
go out with girls,

18
00:01:05.270 --> 00:01:08.630
but pretty much he preferred to perform his first chemical experiments in a

19
00:01:08.631 --> 00:01:12.290
friend's makeshift laboratory chemistry had become his own way of expressing an

20
00:01:12.291 --> 00:01:13.460
early teenage rebellion.

21
00:01:13.580 --> 00:01:17.510
His belief was that science could lead to a deeper understanding of life and the

22
00:01:17.511 --> 00:01:18.620
universe. Moreover,

23
00:01:18.650 --> 00:01:21.830
Primo fell to political dissonance inside his growing fascination with

24
00:01:21.831 --> 00:01:23.690
chemistry, rational approach,

25
00:01:24.410 --> 00:01:27.920
contrasted against the irrational soul of the growing fascist momentum all

26
00:01:27.921 --> 00:01:28.670
around him.

27
00:01:28.670 --> 00:01:33.440
One of fascism slogans at the time was believe a Bay fight,

28
00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:38.300
but Primo was not too keen on unbelieving without understanding first as for the

29
00:01:38.301 --> 00:01:39.134
other two.

30
00:01:39.140 --> 00:01:43.460
Well like all his schoolmates Primo had to obey and fight in the training drills

31
00:01:43.461 --> 00:01:46.520
of the fascist parties, youth organizations at this stage,

32
00:01:46.521 --> 00:01:50.840
the mid 1930s Mussolini had not yet adopted racial laws at the time.

33
00:01:50.841 --> 00:01:55.130
Many Jews were actually fascist supporters in September of 1937.

34
00:01:55.131 --> 00:01:57.680
Primo signed up for chemistry at the university of QRN.

35
00:01:58.100 --> 00:01:59.540
Then he thrived enjoying many hours,

36
00:01:59.541 --> 00:02:03.050
spent in the laboratory using his hands to assemble lab equipments,

37
00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:06.920
to distill elements and create compounds. So I'm away from university.

38
00:02:06.921 --> 00:02:10.130
Also gave him some respite from tension at home Primo's mother,

39
00:02:10.490 --> 00:02:12.440
her and found out that her husband was having an affair,

40
00:02:12.980 --> 00:02:16.430
had a family history of depression and suffered from the illness itself.

41
00:02:16.580 --> 00:02:19.430
So is betrayal only aggravated her status.

42
00:02:19.460 --> 00:02:24.290
She projected a hatred of CSRA onto his son becoming cold distance and hostile

43
00:02:24.380 --> 00:02:25.370
levies biographer.

44
00:02:25.850 --> 00:02:29.210
Caroline Angia believes that it was then that Primo began to feel the effects of

45
00:02:29.211 --> 00:02:30.560
clinical depression himself,

46
00:02:30.590 --> 00:02:34.910
either from hereditary predispositions or triggered by environmental factors,

47
00:02:35.120 --> 00:02:36.980
factors that were definitely stressful,

48
00:02:37.010 --> 00:02:40.580
both inside and outside home on September the fifth, 1938,

49
00:02:40.581 --> 00:02:44.150
the fascist government issued the first racial laws meant to discriminate

50
00:02:44.151 --> 00:02:48.440
against Jews. Primo described his reaction as the trauma of being told,

51
00:02:48.590 --> 00:02:52.970
watch out, you are not like the others. You are worse. You are a miser.

52
00:02:53.030 --> 00:02:56.720
You are dirty, you are dangerous foreign on trustworthy.

53
00:02:56.840 --> 00:03:00.670
Primo was never openly ostracized at university, but he didn't do a,

54
00:03:00.671 --> 00:03:01.540
some isolation.

55
00:03:01.570 --> 00:03:06.100
One of the few students who did not avoid him was one Sandro dumb Mastro Sandro

56
00:03:06.160 --> 00:03:10.300
athletic, but not academically inclined was tutored by Primo. In exchange.

57
00:03:10.301 --> 00:03:14.230
His friend introduced him to mountaineering. Primo was small and scrawny,

58
00:03:14.231 --> 00:03:18.070
but with Sandra his coaching, he was able to withstand a grueling routine.

59
00:03:18.280 --> 00:03:19.450
After just a few months,

60
00:03:19.510 --> 00:03:22.210
the two would cycle from tierings to the nearby Alps climb,

61
00:03:22.211 --> 00:03:24.250
steep mountain signs, almost bare handed,

62
00:03:24.251 --> 00:03:26.620
and then cycle back at night during weekends,

63
00:03:26.621 --> 00:03:29.650
they camped in the freezing cold on snow covered. Mountain tops.

64
00:03:29.710 --> 00:03:31.480
Soon world war two had begun.

65
00:03:31.570 --> 00:03:35.560
Darkness was encroaching Primo called it the night of Europe.

66
00:03:35.620 --> 00:03:39.610
As the lights went out in the minds of many Europeans Primo realized that Sandra.

67
00:03:40.650 --> 00:03:41.940
<v 1>Train again for a future.</v>

68
00:03:49.380 --> 00:03:52.200
<v 0>In 1941, Primo graduated with distinction,</v>

69
00:03:52.201 --> 00:03:56.430
but had no time to celebrate his father was very ill with cancer and could not

70
00:03:56.431 --> 00:03:57.660
provide for the family anymore.

71
00:03:57.720 --> 00:04:01.600
The young graduate needed to find a job fast and he did a young officer,

72
00:04:01.860 --> 00:04:05.580
offered him a top secret job at an asbestos quarry run by the military.

73
00:04:05.670 --> 00:04:09.060
That was strange enough. I mean the army employing a Jew,

74
00:04:09.210 --> 00:04:12.420
the left tendons informs him that his job was not strictly official.

75
00:04:12.450 --> 00:04:15.750
His duty was to synthesize nickel from the quarries waste material,

76
00:04:15.751 --> 00:04:19.830
a job which may have been an army experiment or simply a Sony to gig set up by

77
00:04:19.831 --> 00:04:21.970
the officer. Nonetheless, pretty much accepted the job,

78
00:04:21.990 --> 00:04:25.530
adopting a false identity and never revealing his religious affiliation.

79
00:04:25.650 --> 00:04:30.200
Primo proved his worth by working out an innovative process to extract nickel,

80
00:04:30.660 --> 00:04:31.493
try soon damned.

81
00:04:31.530 --> 00:04:35.070
And when he realized that the Nichole could benefit the axis militaries and only

82
00:04:35.071 --> 00:04:39.150
case Primo superiors found his process too expensive and shut down the lab.

83
00:04:39.510 --> 00:04:43.080
Premier left the quarry and accepted another job in Milan this time with a Swiss

84
00:04:43.081 --> 00:04:44.850
pharmaceutical firm. Once again,

85
00:04:44.880 --> 00:04:49.620
the job was top secret and he was instructed not to reveal his identity or his

86
00:04:49.621 --> 00:04:50.340
religion.

87
00:04:50.340 --> 00:04:54.960
His boss director martini needed a chemist to isolate phosphorus from flowers in

88
00:04:54.961 --> 00:04:58.530
order to produce an oral treatment for diabetes while martini was busy,

89
00:04:58.560 --> 00:05:01.440
fooling around with the secretary, Primo did his best on the job,

90
00:05:01.470 --> 00:05:04.020
enjoying the company of Julia university, friends,

91
00:05:04.410 --> 00:05:07.410
Primo and Julia spent more and more time together. Alas,

92
00:05:07.411 --> 00:05:08.790
much like the Nobel gasses.

93
00:05:08.791 --> 00:05:12.600
Julia had no intention of establishing a bond chemical or otherwise with Primo

94
00:05:12.630 --> 00:05:16.560
firmly friends owned by his coworker pretty started hanging out with a group of

95
00:05:16.561 --> 00:05:19.920
young Jewish men and women in Milan in November of 1942,

96
00:05:19.921 --> 00:05:22.890
the allies landed in North Africa. This gave Primo and his friends.

97
00:05:22.891 --> 00:05:25.800
Some hope that the fascist regime would soon be toppled.

98
00:05:25.800 --> 00:05:29.850
And they joined the budding resistance movements in Northern Italy on July the

99
00:05:29.851 --> 00:05:33.450
ninth, 1943. The allies landed in Sicily on the 25th muscly.

100
00:05:33.451 --> 00:05:37.770
And he was deposed by his own grand council of fascism and later arrested by

101
00:05:37.771 --> 00:05:40.890
King Victor manual. The third Primos underground activity,

102
00:05:40.950 --> 00:05:44.640
intensified working as a liaison agent against several factions within the

103
00:05:44.641 --> 00:05:47.820
resistance on the 8th of September new prime minister Marshall,

104
00:05:47.821 --> 00:05:51.240
but Oleo announced this. An armistice had been signed with the allies.

105
00:05:51.450 --> 00:05:53.100
The Germans were taken by surprise,

106
00:05:53.101 --> 00:05:56.850
but quickly occupied Northern and central Italy establishing a new puppet.

107
00:05:57.260 --> 00:06:01.340
The situation was now highly dangerous for Jews Primo left Milan for the Albus

108
00:06:01.341 --> 00:06:04.970
where he joined a partisan unit consisting of 11 fighters, amateurish,

109
00:06:05.660 --> 00:06:06.710
untrained, and badly equipped.

110
00:06:06.740 --> 00:06:09.500
They were marked by distrust among disparate factions.

111
00:06:09.710 --> 00:06:13.430
It seems the premium's unit was involved in the execution of the supposed

112
00:06:13.431 --> 00:06:16.070
infiltrator, although he never offered much in the way of details.

113
00:06:16.130 --> 00:06:17.420
In December of 1943,

114
00:06:17.421 --> 00:06:20.990
the ROCI partisans welcomed into their ranks and experienced fighter who

115
00:06:20.991 --> 00:06:25.370
organized extensive firearm drills. This increased the skills and confidence,

116
00:06:25.371 --> 00:06:28.970
but left them with a little ammunition, which was used up during training.

117
00:06:29.180 --> 00:06:29.840
That lack of ammo.

118
00:06:29.840 --> 00:06:33.410
It became fatal when the fascist militia showed up on December the 13th,

119
00:06:33.440 --> 00:06:35.960
since Primo and his comrades as good, not fight back.

120
00:06:36.020 --> 00:06:40.040
Eight partisans managed to escape. A Primo and two companions were arrested.

121
00:06:40.160 --> 00:06:43.160
It was a little surprise when those who were captured discovered the identity of

122
00:06:43.161 --> 00:06:46.490
their interrogator, it was that same experienced instructor.

123
00:06:46.760 --> 00:06:50.060
It was actually a fascist spy after a long interrogation,

124
00:06:50.390 --> 00:06:52.940
preload admitted to being a Jew, partly out of fatigue,

125
00:06:53.090 --> 00:06:55.790
but partly out of the surge of haughty pride,

126
00:06:56.030 --> 00:06:59.000
he was deported to the concentration camp for solely descended.

127
00:06:59.150 --> 00:07:02.710
His short partisan Korea later, he learns that his rock climbing friends,

128
00:07:03.320 --> 00:07:06.230
Sandra Hood joined the resistance. His career had also been cut short,

129
00:07:06.380 --> 00:07:07.280
not by capture,

130
00:07:07.310 --> 00:07:11.960
but by the bursts of a Tommy gun shot by a 15 year old black shirts Walla for

131
00:07:12.410 --> 00:07:15.530
Sali. Primo was generally treated well, but in February of 1944,

132
00:07:15.531 --> 00:07:17.390
the SS took over the camp. One day,

133
00:07:17.391 --> 00:07:20.390
the Jewish prisoners were suddenly told to get ready to be moved to a new camp.

134
00:07:20.391 --> 00:07:24.080
The following day Primo and the others had only a single night to prepare for

135
00:07:24.081 --> 00:07:28.130
the relocation. One brief exquisite night, they wished would never end,

136
00:07:28.220 --> 00:07:33.050
but as he would eventually write, Dawn came upon them like a portrayal 650 men,

137
00:07:33.140 --> 00:07:35.450
women and children were transferred to the train station.

138
00:07:36.080 --> 00:07:38.960
Remote noticed the name of their destination scrolled on a sign.

139
00:07:39.080 --> 00:07:42.260
It sounded like Austerlitz, but it wasn't.

140
00:07:42.410 --> 00:07:44.960
The convoy was headed to Europe's heart of darkness,

141
00:07:52.630 --> 00:07:57.310
650 deep OTs crammed into 12 wagons traveled four days and four

142
00:07:57.311 --> 00:08:01.780
nights food was scarce and water was completely absent mass like castle.

143
00:08:01.781 --> 00:08:06.070
The deportees had no room to lie down and no privacy for their physiological

144
00:08:06.071 --> 00:08:06.850
needs.

145
00:08:06.850 --> 00:08:11.410
The humanity and dignity were gradually dissolved like bodies and hydrofluoric

146
00:08:11.411 --> 00:08:14.260
acid. The train arrived at Auschwitz in the dead of night.

147
00:08:14.380 --> 00:08:17.590
The doors opened onto a large platform and the prisoners were subjected to the

148
00:08:17.591 --> 00:08:21.010
infamous selection process by a group of SS offices.

149
00:08:21.040 --> 00:08:24.700
Based on age health and fitness, the company is divided into two groups.

150
00:08:24.760 --> 00:08:27.160
Able-bodied men and women would be sent to labor camps.

151
00:08:27.190 --> 00:08:30.100
The others were transferred to bark an hour where the gas chambers in

152
00:08:30.101 --> 00:08:31.600
crematorium were located.

153
00:08:31.750 --> 00:08:35.410
Primo noted how the SS method of selection was more random than it was initially

154
00:08:35.411 --> 00:08:39.280
appeared. Those who by chance climbed down on a certain side of the convoy were

155
00:08:39.520 --> 00:08:43.270
arbitrarily sent to die. This is how Amelia or a girl from Milan was killed.

156
00:08:43.510 --> 00:08:47.920
Emilia who was curious and cheerful intelligence and ambitious Emilia,

157
00:08:48.460 --> 00:08:51.250
who was three years old. Primo was part of a group of 95.

158
00:08:51.251 --> 00:08:53.200
Men transferred to a satellite labor camp.

159
00:08:53.380 --> 00:08:56.700
Eight kilometers from Auschwitz twenty-five young women were taken to a separate

160
00:08:56.701 --> 00:08:57.570
female labor camp,

161
00:08:57.750 --> 00:09:02.310
the other 530 prisoners of facility with debt within two days,

162
00:09:02.910 --> 00:09:04.890
Primo's new destination was called mano.

163
00:09:04.891 --> 00:09:09.000
It's a camp dedicated to the maintenance of a subsidiary plans of the chemical

164
00:09:09.001 --> 00:09:10.380
giants. IgG Farben.

165
00:09:10.470 --> 00:09:14.040
These chemical plants were intended to produce a synthetic rubber for the German

166
00:09:14.041 --> 00:09:17.820
war effort called Buena. Hence the camp was known as Buena mano it's.

167
00:09:17.850 --> 00:09:21.870
Once their Primo was subjected to the next stages of the dehumanization process,

168
00:09:22.080 --> 00:09:24.150
it was stripped of all his belongings, completely shaved,

169
00:09:24.180 --> 00:09:25.470
and then given a striped uniform,

170
00:09:25.500 --> 00:09:28.650
the foot cloths and independence had been fashioned down to the talents.

171
00:09:28.680 --> 00:09:31.620
The sacred Shoals used by Jews during prayer.

172
00:09:31.710 --> 00:09:35.970
He then received a tattoo number one seven four five one seven from then on

173
00:09:36.290 --> 00:09:36.291
Primo.

174
00:09:36.291 --> 00:09:39.630
And the other prisoners would be referred to only as a series of digits or

175
00:09:39.870 --> 00:09:43.890
collectively as pieces Primo soon realized he needed to just sharpen his wits.

176
00:09:43.891 --> 00:09:44.910
If he wanted to survive,

177
00:09:45.180 --> 00:09:50.010
he had to use his reasons to tame and contrast the senselessness of this new

178
00:09:50.011 --> 00:09:53.100
ecosystem. The Campbell logger in German,

179
00:09:53.310 --> 00:09:56.430
it became clear to him that knowing the German language would give him an edge

180
00:09:56.460 --> 00:10:00.090
prisoners who did not understand orders could immediately be sent to the gas

181
00:10:00.091 --> 00:10:02.010
chambers. During one of these selections,

182
00:10:02.040 --> 00:10:04.890
then promote learned the value of keeping his feet healthy, uh,

183
00:10:05.310 --> 00:10:05.960
Carlos or blister.

184
00:10:05.960 --> 00:10:09.360
It could degenerate into a nasty infection leading to death by sepsis.

185
00:10:09.540 --> 00:10:12.690
Those prisoners who did not die immediately would often develop a limp.

186
00:10:12.720 --> 00:10:16.200
They were slower than the rest, always at the back of the cues to collect food.

187
00:10:16.500 --> 00:10:19.170
Eventually they would be picked at selection. Finally,

188
00:10:19.410 --> 00:10:22.050
levy learns that everybody mano it's was a thief.

189
00:10:22.080 --> 00:10:24.780
Even a friend might steal your bread, your spoon or your shoes,

190
00:10:24.781 --> 00:10:26.370
or even a button thread.

191
00:10:26.730 --> 00:10:30.510
Why anything else that could be exchanged for more food at the black market

192
00:10:30.511 --> 00:10:31.230
within the camp,

193
00:10:31.230 --> 00:10:35.970
besides all that Primo had to contend with the harshness of hard labor moving

194
00:10:35.971 --> 00:10:38.370
heavy construction material from one place to the other.

195
00:10:38.430 --> 00:10:42.300
The shifts were grueling with barely any breaks. Labor has received daily food.

196
00:10:42.301 --> 00:10:46.500
Ration of 500 grams of breads needed with sawdust two balls of watery soup.

197
00:10:46.830 --> 00:10:50.220
And the little margarine Knights did not offer any respites from physical

198
00:10:50.221 --> 00:10:52.830
exhaustion. Prisoners were crammed into overcrowded,

199
00:10:52.831 --> 00:10:56.550
dormitories rife with parasites and pathogens of all kinds.

200
00:10:56.610 --> 00:10:57.391
Campbell authorities,

201
00:10:57.391 --> 00:11:01.050
trying to deal with these infestations by disinfecting the dormitories with

202
00:11:01.051 --> 00:11:04.380
nitrogen mustard, vapor highly toxic for the human inhabitants,

203
00:11:04.381 --> 00:11:09.240
but harmless for the microbes then were supervised at a distance by the SS gods.

204
00:11:09.240 --> 00:11:13.650
But their immediate overseers and tormentors were the capos prisoners selected

205
00:11:13.651 --> 00:11:15.990
by camp administration to direct labor,

206
00:11:16.020 --> 00:11:19.440
maintain discipline and to punish and to humiliate their fellow inmates.

207
00:11:19.530 --> 00:11:22.860
After suffering a foot injury, Primo spent two weeks in the medical block.

208
00:11:23.040 --> 00:11:25.530
The experience gave him some rest from hard labor,

209
00:11:25.531 --> 00:11:28.980
and it's the chance to witness the capita is at work within the infirmary.

210
00:11:29.040 --> 00:11:31.710
The doctors were also prisoners who happened to have medical degrees,

211
00:11:31.711 --> 00:11:34.860
but the nurses and orderlies that no previous professional experience,

212
00:11:35.010 --> 00:11:36.870
they showed no respect for their patients,

213
00:11:36.871 --> 00:11:39.900
stealing their food and bartering it for cigarettes or clothes.

214
00:11:39.990 --> 00:11:43.860
Often they would administer beatings to be ill or subject them to humiliating

215
00:11:43.861 --> 00:11:46.230
punishments. If a patient was thought to be dead,

216
00:11:46.560 --> 00:11:50.310
two orderlies would beat him with oxide news for minutes on end until they were

217
00:11:50.311 --> 00:11:52.350
sure that he wouldn't move any longer.

218
00:11:52.440 --> 00:11:55.930
Even the personnel operated the infamous shower rooms and the gas chambers were

219
00:11:55.931 --> 00:11:56.650
inmates.

220
00:11:56.650 --> 00:12:00.580
They SS selected them from among the ordinary criminals rather than the other

221
00:12:00.581 --> 00:12:02.110
so-called undesirables.

222
00:12:02.260 --> 00:12:05.290
It was they who led the other prisoners inside the showers. It was,

223
00:12:05.291 --> 00:12:08.920
they handle the metal containers labeled Zipline B,

224
00:12:09.310 --> 00:12:12.640
but the destruction of all kinds of them in before putting the gas to bodies

225
00:12:12.641 --> 00:12:13.360
into the ovens,

226
00:12:13.360 --> 00:12:17.110
a special squad of overseers cut off the hair and extracted that gold teeth.

227
00:12:17.380 --> 00:12:21.610
The ashes were then scattered and fields and gardens is a fertilizer for this.

228
00:12:28.470 --> 00:12:29.303
No, man is an Island.

229
00:12:29.340 --> 00:12:33.240
Despite his intelligence and adaptability Primo could not survive on his own.

230
00:12:33.330 --> 00:12:35.700
He needed a friends. And even in that hell,

231
00:12:35.701 --> 00:12:39.210
he was able to find some remarkable companions. People like Lorenzo,

232
00:12:39.330 --> 00:12:41.700
a civilian construction, Wacker risking his own life.

233
00:12:41.701 --> 00:12:45.420
Lorenzo managed to smuggle extra rations of food to the scrawny Primo,

234
00:12:45.421 --> 00:12:46.530
allowing him to survive.

235
00:12:46.650 --> 00:12:50.220
There was also a French inmates in charge of transporting food rations.

236
00:12:50.460 --> 00:12:54.510
Joel wanted to learn Italian. So he pulled some strings to have Primo assigned,

237
00:12:54.511 --> 00:12:58.050
to help with its relatively light duties in a memorable moments while

238
00:12:58.051 --> 00:13:02.010
transporting a VAT of soup. Primo torsional about Dante's divine comedy,

239
00:13:02.100 --> 00:13:05.070
but Primo's best friend in mano it's was another Italian Jew.

240
00:13:05.250 --> 00:13:10.230
Alberto Dalla Volta, unlike Primo, Alberto was extroverted and gregarious,

241
00:13:10.231 --> 00:13:14.160
a chronic optimist who was able to communicate and network with everybody within

242
00:13:14.161 --> 00:13:15.180
the camp. Alberto,

243
00:13:15.300 --> 00:13:18.240
his positive energy in the face of despair was so overwhelming that Primo

244
00:13:18.241 --> 00:13:22.680
described him as one against whom the weapons of the night were blunted.

245
00:13:22.920 --> 00:13:26.220
At the end of 1944. Pre-med had his life saved by science camp.

246
00:13:26.221 --> 00:13:29.220
Authorities were looking for prisoners with the knowledge of chemistry to work

247
00:13:29.221 --> 00:13:31.500
within the Buena labs. He eagerly volunteered,

248
00:13:31.530 --> 00:13:35.190
sat an exam and was accepted for the role. It was still a slave labor,

249
00:13:35.220 --> 00:13:38.730
but one that could be carried out in doors rather than in the violence.

250
00:13:38.731 --> 00:13:41.790
Polish Windsor Primo was under strict supervision,

251
00:13:41.791 --> 00:13:44.070
but manage to carry out small acts of sabotage.

252
00:13:44.100 --> 00:13:47.700
Not that they would need it constantly harassed by Soviet bombing raids.

253
00:13:47.701 --> 00:13:51.210
The of plant never produced a single gram of synthetic rubber.

254
00:13:51.330 --> 00:13:55.110
When the air raid sirens blasted German supervisors rushed to the shelters as

255
00:13:55.111 --> 00:13:57.690
well. Primo and the other prisoners were left in the lab.

256
00:13:57.810 --> 00:14:01.050
This gave him the chance to explore the lab scavenging for useful loot.

257
00:14:01.140 --> 00:14:03.180
He even tried using lab supplies for food.

258
00:14:03.510 --> 00:14:07.230
He experiments by using cotton fritters or glycerin, which were nutritious,

259
00:14:07.231 --> 00:14:08.370
but disgusting.

260
00:14:08.610 --> 00:14:12.390
One day he stumbled upon some small metal rods and he brought them to Alberto.

261
00:14:12.570 --> 00:14:16.860
The two realized that rods were made of cerium the same material used as Flint

262
00:14:16.950 --> 00:14:18.420
and cigarette lighters. They're resourceful.

263
00:14:18.421 --> 00:14:22.380
Alberto found out that some prisoners sat up a clandestine workshop to produce

264
00:14:22.381 --> 00:14:24.360
lighters, risking execution prima,

265
00:14:24.660 --> 00:14:27.810
but I stole all of the rods and sold them on the black market in exchange for

266
00:14:27.811 --> 00:14:30.960
some breads and enough to keep them alive for an extra couple of months.

267
00:14:31.080 --> 00:14:34.650
By January, 1945, the Soviets weren't just flying bombing missions overhead.

268
00:14:34.920 --> 00:14:36.240
They had reached the prison Gates,

269
00:14:36.300 --> 00:14:40.020
the SS received orders to evacuate Auschwitz and all of its dependence.

270
00:14:40.050 --> 00:14:41.580
Just on the Eve of relocation.

271
00:14:41.610 --> 00:14:45.270
Primo fell ill with Scarlet fever and must have to die in the camp infirmary.

272
00:14:45.360 --> 00:14:48.690
Alberto Lynn's 11,000 prisoners were to be transferred to another camp.

273
00:14:48.780 --> 00:14:51.560
The two friends bade farewell to each other one time.

274
00:14:51.710 --> 00:14:55.640
Primo was certain that he was going to die while Alberto might ultimately move

275
00:14:55.641 --> 00:14:58.010
on and survive. This was not the case.

276
00:14:58.040 --> 00:15:01.340
The few SS left at the infantry were ordered to kill all of the patients,

277
00:15:01.370 --> 00:15:04.550
but they flooded in a hurry. As the Soviets approached on the other hand,

278
00:15:04.580 --> 00:15:08.510
most of the 11,000 prisoners on the move were slaughtered in what became a death

279
00:15:08.511 --> 00:15:12.290
March. Roberto was one of them in the final days in the Manu it's infirmary,

280
00:15:12.320 --> 00:15:15.320
Primo partially recovered alongside a French friend Shaul.

281
00:15:15.321 --> 00:15:19.670
He did his best to help the patients by scavenging food and medicines from the

282
00:15:19.671 --> 00:15:21.020
abandoned SS barracks.

283
00:15:21.080 --> 00:15:25.520
Only one of the inmates in their cat died as Primo and Charles were burying him

284
00:15:25.521 --> 00:15:26.354
in the snow.

285
00:15:26.360 --> 00:15:30.230
They met the gaze of four Soviet Scouts on horseback now in the cab of Russian

286
00:15:30.231 --> 00:15:33.590
liberator's Primo and other Italian prisoners, but well-treated,

287
00:15:33.800 --> 00:15:36.230
but it took seven months for them to return home,

288
00:15:36.500 --> 00:15:39.200
the used of disorganization and a lack of working railways,

289
00:15:39.230 --> 00:15:42.440
Primo meandered through Ponant Ukrainian, better Reese, Romania, Hungary,

290
00:15:42.441 --> 00:15:46.910
and Austria. Before finally reaching tearin. The journey was not all unpleasant.

291
00:15:46.940 --> 00:15:47.511
On the contrary,

292
00:15:47.511 --> 00:15:51.170
the Russians did their best to feed the ex-prisoners even ensuring they have a

293
00:15:51.171 --> 00:15:54.200
monthly ration of 10 ounces of tobacco, the red army soldiers,

294
00:15:54.230 --> 00:15:58.010
medical personnel, and ex-prisoners also organized film nights stage plays.

295
00:15:58.011 --> 00:16:00.530
And for RT shows during his Odyssey, as usual,

296
00:16:00.531 --> 00:16:03.890
Primo was able to forge alliances with friends impervious to the blows of

297
00:16:03.891 --> 00:16:07.550
darkness. He prevented a man who shared the same name as his father Cesare,

298
00:16:07.580 --> 00:16:10.250
who used a mixture of hand gestures, Roman street,

299
00:16:10.810 --> 00:16:14.930
dialect and positive enthusiasm to communicate with local tradesman and hustle

300
00:16:14.931 --> 00:16:19.520
for food. He also met an older man named Marto. Now Homer rugged Greek veteran.

301
00:16:19.610 --> 00:16:23.450
He warned Primo never to be caught bare footed because in a war you always need

302
00:16:23.451 --> 00:16:27.470
shoes. And when Primo noted that the war was now over Moto replied solemnly.

303
00:16:28.300 --> 00:16:29.290
<v 3>Well, it's a always.</v>

304
00:16:35.440 --> 00:16:37.840
<v 0>Premier reached cheer in, in August of 1945,</v>

305
00:16:37.900 --> 00:16:40.000
his mother and sister believing him to be dead,

306
00:16:40.570 --> 00:16:43.270
that he recognized him almost immediately upon his return.

307
00:16:43.660 --> 00:16:47.140
Primo felt compelled to tell a story as is the case with many authors writing

308
00:16:47.141 --> 00:16:50.230
became the kind of therapy to cope with the trauma that he had survived.

309
00:16:50.500 --> 00:16:53.410
His notes on the sanitary conditions at Manoa wits were published in a

310
00:16:53.411 --> 00:16:55.600
prestigious medical journal in 1946.

311
00:16:55.720 --> 00:16:59.020
His account became known as the Auschwitz report and played a huge part in

312
00:16:59.110 --> 00:17:01.780
shining a light on the horrific events of world war II,

313
00:17:01.900 --> 00:17:06.820
Primo expanders on those notes drafting his first book survival in Auschwitz

314
00:17:07.150 --> 00:17:07.631
in the breakfast,

315
00:17:07.631 --> 00:17:12.280
Primo warned against the dangers of irrational hatred is it can do easily become

316
00:17:12.281 --> 00:17:15.310
the basis for an organized system. Stating many people,

317
00:17:15.430 --> 00:17:19.750
many nations can find themselves holding that every stranger is an enemy.

318
00:17:19.840 --> 00:17:23.410
This conviction lies deep down like some latent infection.

319
00:17:23.560 --> 00:17:28.480
It betrays itself only in random disconnected acts and does not lie at the base

320
00:17:28.481 --> 00:17:29.470
of a system of reason.

321
00:17:29.680 --> 00:17:33.910
But when the unspoken dogma becomes the major premise in a syllogism,

322
00:17:34.270 --> 00:17:38.590
then at the end of the chain, there is the log of the book in Italy,

323
00:17:38.591 --> 00:17:42.340
the UK and other countries it's titled. If this is a man after a poem,

324
00:17:42.341 --> 00:17:46.870
authored by Primo and it's he ponders. If a human being can retain his nature,

325
00:17:46.930 --> 00:17:50.520
even after his dignity has been trampled on premium himself,

326
00:17:50.550 --> 00:17:54.690
did retain his humanity solely returning to life. In September of 1947,

327
00:17:54.691 --> 00:17:58.440
he took up a job as a chemist at Seaver, a varnish factory in December,

328
00:17:58.500 --> 00:18:00.690
he married his fiance. This was Lucia.

329
00:18:01.440 --> 00:18:04.440
[inaudible] one of the few who had listened to the stories of the camps.

330
00:18:04.441 --> 00:18:06.450
And you helped him edit his writings.

331
00:18:06.660 --> 00:18:11.340
The two had two children Lorenza in 1948 and Renzo in 1957 while working at

332
00:18:11.670 --> 00:18:14.520
Siva Primo succeeded in publishing his memoirs in 1949,

333
00:18:14.521 --> 00:18:16.980
a small publisher released the first edition of survival,

334
00:18:16.981 --> 00:18:21.000
but with little promotion or interest behind it, it was only in 1958,

335
00:18:21.001 --> 00:18:22.050
the publishing Johns,

336
00:18:22.051 --> 00:18:27.000
I nowadays widely distributed it attracting international attention in 1963,

337
00:18:27.120 --> 00:18:31.350
Primo released as followup to survival known in the U S as the reawakening,

338
00:18:31.440 --> 00:18:35.460
this book recounts Primos adventures while returning home, after his liberation,

339
00:18:35.700 --> 00:18:39.540
despite the overall positive and lighter tone, there is a dark hue,

340
00:18:39.780 --> 00:18:42.630
the Italian title translators, the truce,

341
00:18:42.690 --> 00:18:45.540
which is probably closer to what Primo was going for.

342
00:18:45.720 --> 00:18:48.810
He considered the period of his adventures to be a truce,

343
00:18:48.960 --> 00:18:53.460
a truce between the end of world war two and the onset of the cold war or the

344
00:18:53.461 --> 00:18:56.130
brief playful ends of all laughter surviving the darkness.

345
00:18:56.131 --> 00:19:00.990
And before readapting to society with darkness stood side on an even

346
00:19:00.991 --> 00:19:01.890
more personal level,

347
00:19:01.891 --> 00:19:05.490
Primo may have felt that his journey was a period of peace between the cosmic

348
00:19:05.491 --> 00:19:08.580
horrors of the camp and the intimate struggle of his depression,

349
00:19:08.581 --> 00:19:10.860
which reoccurred in the late 1940s,

350
00:19:11.280 --> 00:19:14.940
as more to it said war is always in the outer world. Yes,

351
00:19:15.150 --> 00:19:19.200
but also perhaps within our souls, following the success of his first books,

352
00:19:19.500 --> 00:19:23.400
Primo continued to write focusing primarily on collections of short stories and

353
00:19:23.401 --> 00:19:27.090
he could be classified as science fictional fantasy has most accomplished effort

354
00:19:27.091 --> 00:19:30.990
in this genre is questi all the can Tori and it's the narrator forges a

355
00:19:30.991 --> 00:19:32.550
friendship with the captive center.

356
00:19:32.580 --> 00:19:36.030
The creatures rational side is usually preeminence until he falls in love with

357
00:19:36.031 --> 00:19:37.980
the narrators girlfriends driven by passion.

358
00:19:37.981 --> 00:19:42.210
The animal side emerges and the center escapes and a frenzy of lost levees.

359
00:19:42.240 --> 00:19:46.170
Most famous story collection though is the periodic table of

360
00:19:46.171 --> 00:19:47.340
1975.

361
00:19:47.490 --> 00:19:51.720
This collection was crowned as the best scientific book ever in 2006 by the

362
00:19:51.721 --> 00:19:55.800
Royal institution of great Britain. Each story uses chemistry as a metaphor.

363
00:19:55.860 --> 00:20:00.240
So you interpret life and is titled after an elements of the periodic table.

364
00:20:00.270 --> 00:20:03.480
For example, iron is about Primo's friendship with Sandra,

365
00:20:03.510 --> 00:20:07.770
the rock climber who trains him for a future made of iron sulfur is about an

366
00:20:07.771 --> 00:20:09.330
engineer at a plot to prevent say,

367
00:20:09.340 --> 00:20:13.800
disastrous accidents involving an industrial sized boy learns a stash of sulfur.

368
00:20:13.890 --> 00:20:17.490
In other words, he tames a piece of chaotic machinery with his intellect,

369
00:20:17.550 --> 00:20:19.650
both sulfur and Castillo. This tour,

370
00:20:19.651 --> 00:20:22.710
I deal with a recurring theme of levees,

371
00:20:22.740 --> 00:20:26.550
the conflict between reason and chaos and eternal struggle without.

372
00:20:26.670 --> 00:20:27.503
<v 1>Clear winner.</v>

373
00:20:34.170 --> 00:20:34.971
<v 0>The rear view mirror,</v>

374
00:20:34.971 --> 00:20:39.500
the main conflict of levies live shifted from external to internal to better

375
00:20:39.501 --> 00:20:42.020
understand levees struggle with depression.

376
00:20:42.050 --> 00:20:45.080
It's important to consider his private life in the views of biographer,

377
00:20:45.110 --> 00:20:49.950
Carol angrier and Ian Thompson loving saw the power of reason as a holding bank.

378
00:20:50.110 --> 00:20:53.200
The dark irrational force of clinical depression,

379
00:20:53.320 --> 00:20:56.890
according to Anglia levies depression was the result of a troubled relationship

380
00:20:56.891 --> 00:21:01.750
with his mother runs of a sexless frustrating marital life. I as theses,

381
00:21:01.960 --> 00:21:05.560
uh, disputed by many critics, you believe Levy's depression was hereditary.

382
00:21:05.680 --> 00:21:08.260
His grandfather suffered from it and to commit suicide.

383
00:21:08.380 --> 00:21:11.920
Another controversial claim is that the ordeal that Manu it's did not worse than

384
00:21:12.310 --> 00:21:15.970
Primo's depression. On the contrary, it honed his survival skills and intellect.

385
00:21:16.180 --> 00:21:18.820
Primo levy confirmed this to American writer,

386
00:21:19.480 --> 00:21:21.670
Philip Roth throughout the 1970s and 1980s,

387
00:21:21.700 --> 00:21:24.970
Primo levy sought medical help to treat his condition. A fact,

388
00:21:24.971 --> 00:21:27.580
he largely kept hidden from the public and most friends,

389
00:21:27.670 --> 00:21:30.430
a rare ally in his moments of darkness was German pen.

390
00:21:30.431 --> 00:21:34.600
Pal had the Schmidt mass who corresponded with him for 17 years since

391
00:21:34.601 --> 00:21:35.680
1966,

392
00:21:36.130 --> 00:21:39.070
had he wanted to documents and understand the crimes of the third Reich and

393
00:21:39.071 --> 00:21:41.950
especially the complicity of IAG Farb and chemical works.

394
00:21:42.340 --> 00:21:45.880
That relationship became a true friendship as they wrote about their respective

395
00:21:45.881 --> 00:21:46.810
marital problems,

396
00:21:46.870 --> 00:21:50.950
how to embrace them face to face on two occasions in 1968 and 1971.

397
00:21:51.010 --> 00:21:54.460
How do you notice how Primo was charismatic and self-assured on their first

398
00:21:54.461 --> 00:21:57.670
encounter, but appeared nervous and depressed three years later.

399
00:21:58.030 --> 00:22:00.670
And yet Primo's public persona had never betrayed his malady,

400
00:22:00.700 --> 00:22:04.660
delivering lectures and interviews with a pleasant and humorous demeanor that

401
00:22:04.840 --> 00:22:07.360
they frequently clashed with revisionist historians,

402
00:22:07.361 --> 00:22:10.900
especially those who minimize the cruelty of the camp system by pointing out

403
00:22:10.901 --> 00:22:11.800
other nations.

404
00:22:11.950 --> 00:22:15.220
And other times had done something similar as he did not pull any punches.

405
00:22:15.221 --> 00:22:18.250
Primo found himself embroiled in controversy with the Israeli government as

406
00:22:18.251 --> 00:22:20.680
well, criticizing his actions against Palestinians.

407
00:22:20.710 --> 00:22:23.620
He famously declared that Palestinians were Israel's Jews.

408
00:22:23.650 --> 00:22:27.610
They were the new victims of those would once been persecuted themselves

409
00:22:34.830 --> 00:22:36.450
83 had he died at age 65.

410
00:22:36.720 --> 00:22:40.380
Her death precipitated another depressive episode for levy. Nonetheless,

411
00:22:40.590 --> 00:22:44.130
he completed what would be his last major work, the drowns and the saved,

412
00:22:44.131 --> 00:22:45.900
which was published in 1986.

413
00:22:46.110 --> 00:22:49.140
It is a collection of essays on the themes of the camps,

414
00:22:49.230 --> 00:22:53.220
survival and prisoners collaboration with their capitalists in January and

415
00:22:53.221 --> 00:22:54.480
February,

416
00:22:54.480 --> 00:22:59.190
1987 levy met three times with critic and biographer Giovanni Tessio in the

417
00:22:59.191 --> 00:22:59.760
interviews.

418
00:22:59.760 --> 00:23:03.720
Primo confirmed that he had suffered from depression as a teenager and spoke at

419
00:23:03.721 --> 00:23:07.140
length about his father, but was quite reticent in talking about his mother.

420
00:23:07.410 --> 00:23:10.680
When Tessio tried to arrange a fourth meeting or the declines,

421
00:23:10.770 --> 00:23:13.650
he was going through a dark patch, he was suffering too much.

422
00:23:13.770 --> 00:23:17.310
The two would never meet again on April the 11th, 1997,

423
00:23:17.640 --> 00:23:20.370
Bremer Levy's body was found lying at the bottom of the stairwell in the

424
00:23:20.371 --> 00:23:24.660
apartment block where he lived since birth, the police ruled it to be a suicide.

425
00:23:24.810 --> 00:23:29.010
Some biographers agree with this blaming Primo suicide on a major depressive

426
00:23:29.011 --> 00:23:32.490
episode brought on by his unresolved lifelong issues.

427
00:23:32.580 --> 00:23:35.820
Others believe the roots of Primo's illness lies in the trauma of Auschwitz.

428
00:23:36.090 --> 00:23:38.310
Some dismiss the idea of suicide altogether,

429
00:23:38.311 --> 00:23:39.930
believing his death to be an accident.

430
00:23:40.170 --> 00:23:43.380
It may have been caused by dizziness and disorientation side effects of

431
00:23:43.400 --> 00:23:46.040
antidepressants bus. We won't a solution here.

432
00:23:46.100 --> 00:23:50.060
What matters to us and people worldwide is his legacy and his works some of the

433
00:23:50.061 --> 00:23:53.450
most important living testimonies from the horrors of the Shaw.

434
00:23:53.480 --> 00:23:57.080
Premier levy taught us that when the conviction that every stranger is an enemy

435
00:23:57.081 --> 00:23:59.990
becomes dogma. Then at the end of the chain,

436
00:24:00.260 --> 00:24:02.450
there is death on an industrial level,

437
00:24:02.690 --> 00:24:07.010
but humankind has not learned this yet elsewhere. In other times,

438
00:24:07.430 --> 00:24:10.520
other chains have been formed. And at the end of those chains,

439
00:24:10.960 --> 00:24:12.320
there were the gulags of Kalima.

440
00:24:12.440 --> 00:24:15.770
There were a masker that's Rebecca and the Casani pits,

441
00:24:16.010 --> 00:24:20.660
the killing fields in Cambodia and in Rwanda, Sabra and Shatila.

442
00:24:21.050 --> 00:24:23.150
And the list goes on Wars always.

443
00:24:23.480 --> 00:24:26.270
And the weapons of the Knights are still sharp.

444
00:24:28.190 --> 00:24:31.610
So I really hope you found that video. Interesting. Thank you for watching.
