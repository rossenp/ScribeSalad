1
00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:03.780
<v 0>It's the deadliest bioterror attack in American history on October, the second,</v>

2
00:00:03.781 --> 00:00:07.650
2001 photo editor, Robert Stevens was rushed to hospital suffering,

3
00:00:07.651 --> 00:00:10.200
breathing difficulties. Three days later, he was dead.

4
00:00:10.260 --> 00:00:14.160
The first person to die of anthrax on us soil in 25 years.

5
00:00:14.190 --> 00:00:16.080
But rather than being a freak accident,

6
00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:18.630
Stevens's death was the beginning of a nightmare.

7
00:00:18.690 --> 00:00:22.830
Over the next seven weeks envelopes laced with the deadly bacteria were sent to

8
00:00:22.831 --> 00:00:25.860
politicians and media figures. By the time the attack ended,

9
00:00:26.010 --> 00:00:28.950
five people were dead and another 17 had been second.

10
00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:31.950
But while the deaths had stopped, the attacker was still at large.

11
00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:36.060
It would be another seven years before the FBI found its prime suspect.

12
00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:39.420
Dr. Bruce Ivan's an anthrax researcher at Fort Dietrich.

13
00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:41.700
Ivan's was an expert on the bacteria.

14
00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:45.420
According to the fed to see had the beans to carry out the mailings yet his case

15
00:00:45.421 --> 00:00:49.140
never went to trial ending. Instead, when Ivan's committed suicide,

16
00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:53.460
was he guilty or was he an innocent man, hounded death by the FBI? Well,

17
00:00:53.461 --> 00:00:57.480
today we're going to take a look at the attacks that terrified a nation and the

18
00:00:57.481 --> 00:01:00.330
peculiar life of its prime suspect.

19
00:01:12.380 --> 00:01:16.430
Is he also Leo Tolstoy once wrote happy families are all alike.

20
00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:21.140
Every unhappy family is unhappy in its own way for the unhappy family of

21
00:01:21.141 --> 00:01:24.920
Bruce Edwards. Ivan's that misery, it could be traced back to a single source.

22
00:01:24.950 --> 00:01:29.030
When Ivan's was born on April the 22nd, 1964 in Lebanon, Ohio,

23
00:01:29.031 --> 00:01:32.450
it would be fair to say that his mother was not thrilled.

24
00:01:32.510 --> 00:01:35.000
The third of three boys Ivan's was what?

25
00:01:35.001 --> 00:01:37.520
Some parents term happy accidents.

26
00:01:37.820 --> 00:01:41.360
So there was nothing happy about this accident for Mary Ivan's during her

27
00:01:41.361 --> 00:01:41.961
pregnancy,

28
00:01:41.961 --> 00:01:46.160
Mary repeatedly tried to induce a miscarriage by bouncing down the staircase on

29
00:01:46.161 --> 00:01:46.550
her,

30
00:01:46.550 --> 00:01:51.350
but hoping the thought of the impact might kill her child as Ivan's grew up

31
00:01:51.351 --> 00:01:54.590
and became old enough to understand things. Mary would tell him the story,

32
00:01:54.591 --> 00:01:58.840
making it clear how unwanted he was. Sadly, this casual of cruelty.

33
00:01:58.860 --> 00:02:01.310
Wasn't the worst thing to happen in the Ivan's households.

34
00:02:02.120 --> 00:02:05.330
Outwardly the family was happy. Ivan's his father, the alone to pharmacy.

35
00:02:05.331 --> 00:02:09.770
Mary volunteered with a PTA, but behind closed doors, Randall was a pushover.

36
00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:11.960
Mary subjected to brutal violence.

37
00:02:11.990 --> 00:02:16.310
Ivan's witnessed his mother do things like stab his father with a fork and beat

38
00:02:16.311 --> 00:02:19.250
him with a broom. Once she has him so hard over the head with a skillet,

39
00:02:19.820 --> 00:02:22.490
the family thought she had killed him in such circumstances.

40
00:02:22.491 --> 00:02:27.110
It's perhaps no surprise that Bruce Ivan's was a bit of an odd child ferocious,

41
00:02:27.111 --> 00:02:29.690
and the intelligence Ivan's locked himself away from his parents,

42
00:02:29.691 --> 00:02:32.270
devouring books on science, age 30 14,

43
00:02:32.271 --> 00:02:35.630
he was inviting local girls back to see his homemade gunpowder.

44
00:02:35.720 --> 00:02:39.980
But it wouldn't be a stretch to say that Ivan's has any girlfriends or even

45
00:02:39.981 --> 00:02:41.300
friends later in life.

46
00:02:41.420 --> 00:02:45.260
It claim he was unwanted by everyone that he still harbored feelings of hatred

47
00:02:45.261 --> 00:02:48.470
towards the teenage girls who had rejected him latching on to pretty girls and

48
00:02:48.471 --> 00:02:50.930
then becoming consumed with rage. When they didn't return,

49
00:02:50.931 --> 00:02:54.560
his feelings was a pattern that would repeat throughout Ivan's his life.

50
00:02:54.830 --> 00:02:57.950
There's still no one living in this small town could have known about the

51
00:02:57.951 --> 00:03:01.240
resentment smoldering inside the boy as a teenager,

52
00:03:01.270 --> 00:03:03.700
he was outwardly normal gunpowder aside,

53
00:03:03.790 --> 00:03:07.690
taking part in science and running clubs. When he graduated in 1964,

54
00:03:07.691 --> 00:03:11.290
he easily got a place at the university of Cincinnati pursuing a degree in

55
00:03:11.291 --> 00:03:12.490
microbiology. Yes,

56
00:03:12.700 --> 00:03:17.200
even here away from the mother who belittled him and brutalized his father

57
00:03:17.380 --> 00:03:20.140
Ivan's was still acting strange. At some point,

58
00:03:20.141 --> 00:03:23.590
he was turned down by a girl from the Kappa Kappa gamma sorority.

59
00:03:23.830 --> 00:03:28.270
It was the stars of what Ivan's would later describe as an obsession spans,

60
00:03:28.300 --> 00:03:32.230
Ivan's began to fixate on the campus. He followed news about them obsessively.

61
00:03:32.310 --> 00:03:34.570
It began staking out that campus home.

62
00:03:34.630 --> 00:03:37.810
Eventually he came to believe that the sorority, whereas enemies,

63
00:03:37.840 --> 00:03:40.720
one night Ivan's broken to the campus home inside.

64
00:03:40.810 --> 00:03:44.890
He found the cipher decoding the secret rituals. When Ben's left,

65
00:03:44.891 --> 00:03:46.330
he took the cipher with him.

66
00:03:46.450 --> 00:03:48.760
It was the start of a theme in the young man's life,

67
00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:52.750
punishing women through weird acts of theft from here on out.

68
00:03:52.930 --> 00:03:55.300
These acts were really going to get weirder.

69
00:04:01.530 --> 00:04:05.580
The story of only been as his time at college is really the story of two people.

70
00:04:06.030 --> 00:04:06.660
Bomb led school.

71
00:04:06.660 --> 00:04:11.460
Dr. Ivan's was a successful microbiologist who published multiple papers and his

72
00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:16.050
doctorate and fell in love with and married Diane bench in 1975.

73
00:04:16.080 --> 00:04:17.180
The other one let's call it.

74
00:04:17.181 --> 00:04:22.050
A Bruce was a students haunted by deep depression and a growing feeling of anger

75
00:04:22.170 --> 00:04:25.690
on campus. Bruce would carry a loaded gun. Whenever someone slides at him,

76
00:04:25.720 --> 00:04:28.110
he would take the gun out and shoot it. Objects.

77
00:04:28.111 --> 00:04:29.850
Imagining the faces of his enemies.

78
00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:33.900
He fretted in private that it inherited a demon at birth that whatever darkness

79
00:04:34.230 --> 00:04:36.360
liked within his mother had somehow passed onto him.

80
00:04:36.420 --> 00:04:40.650
It was the mid 1970s when Bruce met Nancy Haywood, married campus,

81
00:04:40.651 --> 00:04:44.130
studying microbiology. At first, he tried to befriend her, but Hey, good.

82
00:04:44.131 --> 00:04:46.680
Considered him playing me nice and rebuffed him.

83
00:04:46.920 --> 00:04:50.730
So Bruce decided to teach her a lesson in 1979,

84
00:04:50.760 --> 00:04:52.860
Haygood was working on a doctoral dissertation.

85
00:04:52.950 --> 00:04:57.270
She recorded all of our results and hypotheses in a single notebook and kept it

86
00:04:57.271 --> 00:05:00.240
locked in the lab. Notebook was the key to Haygoods research.

87
00:05:00.270 --> 00:05:02.430
The cipher to decoding her work.

88
00:05:02.550 --> 00:05:06.000
One day it vanished Hegwood was distraught for days.

89
00:05:06.030 --> 00:05:09.930
She lived in a state of panic until finally an anonymous note arrived telling

90
00:05:09.931 --> 00:05:13.350
her the notebook could be recovered from a public mailbox for the rest of her

91
00:05:13.351 --> 00:05:14.730
life. Haywood would swear.

92
00:05:14.760 --> 00:05:18.120
Bruce had been the one who stole her notes as some sort of revenge.

93
00:05:18.270 --> 00:05:21.690
It wouldn't be until 25 years of passed that Bruce Ivan's sat in an

94
00:05:21.691 --> 00:05:26.580
interrogation room and confirmed her suspicions to the FBI in the 1970s though,

95
00:05:26.581 --> 00:05:29.880
these were only suspicions suspicions that grew every time her car was

96
00:05:29.881 --> 00:05:34.320
vandalized. Every time letters appeared in the local press signed in her name,

97
00:05:34.410 --> 00:05:36.690
saying something outrageous many years later,

98
00:05:36.720 --> 00:05:40.320
Bruce would tell a psychiatrist that Haywood reminded him of his mother had even

99
00:05:40.321 --> 00:05:43.770
made detailed plans. He would confess about murdering her,

100
00:05:44.100 --> 00:05:47.820
but while Bruce was becoming creepier as time cramped by his doctor,

101
00:05:47.821 --> 00:05:51.120
Ivan's personality was becoming successful in 1979.

102
00:05:51.121 --> 00:05:53.430
Ivan's began working on anthrax,

103
00:05:53.431 --> 00:05:57.920
a deadly bacteria known for its great bioweapon of potential naturally found in

104
00:05:57.921 --> 00:06:00.560
soil and Franks can enter the body in multiple ways.

105
00:06:00.561 --> 00:06:03.950
The worst of which is inhalation breathing, anthrax spores,

106
00:06:03.951 --> 00:06:08.090
and your chance of dying is around 80% because of this, it was suspected.

107
00:06:08.091 --> 00:06:12.740
The USSR might try to weaponize it when a deadly Soviet anthrax leak in 1979,

108
00:06:12.741 --> 00:06:14.090
confirmed the suspicions.

109
00:06:14.270 --> 00:06:17.300
The U S became desperate to hire experts on the disease.

110
00:06:17.540 --> 00:06:21.080
One of those experts with Dr. Ivan's in December of 1980,

111
00:06:21.081 --> 00:06:24.860
Ivan's now living in Maryland was hired to work at the United States army

112
00:06:24.861 --> 00:06:28.790
medical research Institute of infectious diseases. Zara at Fort Dietrich,

113
00:06:28.791 --> 00:06:32.120
he would grow purify and test anthrax for a possible vaccine.

114
00:06:32.180 --> 00:06:34.880
It was the perfect placement for a young ambitious docs out,

115
00:06:35.030 --> 00:06:36.840
given a secret security clearance.

116
00:06:37.400 --> 00:06:40.580
Ivan's went on to co and a new vaccine becoming one of the world's leading

117
00:06:40.581 --> 00:06:43.610
anthrax experts. He also settled in at work sticking out,

118
00:06:43.940 --> 00:06:44.810
certainly as an office geek,

119
00:06:44.870 --> 00:06:48.320
he would practice unicycling in the corridors and write silly songs for his

120
00:06:48.321 --> 00:06:51.230
colleagues. His go workers just thought he was harmless,

121
00:06:51.290 --> 00:06:56.120
but this was just one side of the dual personality behind the affable dorky.

122
00:06:56.121 --> 00:07:00.650
Ivan's Bruce still looked still harbored his obsessions and

123
00:07:00.651 --> 00:07:02.360
grudges over the next decade.

124
00:07:02.420 --> 00:07:05.330
Those obsessions would grow into something terrifying.

125
00:07:11.320 --> 00:07:11.710
<v 1>[Inaudible].</v>

126
00:07:11.710 --> 00:07:14.050
<v 0>As the 1980s progressed to Bruce's in a life,</v>

127
00:07:14.380 --> 00:07:17.300
begins to revolve around Kappa Kappa gamma up late at night.

128
00:07:17.470 --> 00:07:21.100
He'd leave his home and drive all over the country. Staking out kava houses.

129
00:07:21.160 --> 00:07:24.280
He needs. It told the FBI that had driven to North Carolina and Tennessee,

130
00:07:24.281 --> 00:07:28.510
just so he could look outside sororities and watch the cap of girls on one trip

131
00:07:28.511 --> 00:07:30.400
to West Virginia. He again broke into the house,

132
00:07:30.430 --> 00:07:32.200
stealing the chapters book of ritual.

133
00:07:32.290 --> 00:07:35.260
Bruce was still posing as Nancy Haywood to writing letters,

134
00:07:35.261 --> 00:07:36.340
to newspapers in our name,

135
00:07:36.341 --> 00:07:39.920
defending the practice of hazing and one particularly unpleasant incident.

136
00:07:39.950 --> 00:07:44.140
He sent a copy of Haywood's pro hazing letter to the mother of a boy who died in

137
00:07:44.141 --> 00:07:47.680
a hazing ritual alongside he included a letter in his real name,

138
00:07:48.130 --> 00:07:51.190
common zing on how disgusting Haywood was. But this story,

139
00:07:51.220 --> 00:07:54.910
isn't just a simple as that of a man failing to control his demons.

140
00:07:54.970 --> 00:07:56.290
As the 1990s began,

141
00:07:56.291 --> 00:07:59.590
Ivan's seems to have become increasingly aware that he had problems.

142
00:07:59.740 --> 00:08:03.940
He began seeing counselors taking antidepressants and anti-psychotic drugs in

143
00:08:03.941 --> 00:08:04.511
his sessions.

144
00:08:04.511 --> 00:08:07.840
He would cut loose confessing to one counselor that had procured ammonia,

145
00:08:07.841 --> 00:08:08.441
nitrate,

146
00:08:08.441 --> 00:08:12.460
and bland to make a bomb telling another that he was an avenging angel of death.

147
00:08:12.520 --> 00:08:15.430
But words of this size have got back to his colleagues to them.

148
00:08:15.490 --> 00:08:19.300
He was still Dr. Ivan's red cross volunteer churchgoer and renowned anthrax

149
00:08:19.301 --> 00:08:19.990
expert.

150
00:08:19.990 --> 00:08:23.650
As the millennium Dawn's Ivan's began emailing female lamb technicians telling

151
00:08:23.651 --> 00:08:27.550
them he was having disturbing and violent thoughts in one email to his former

152
00:08:27.551 --> 00:08:28.750
assistant Merlin Scott,

153
00:08:28.751 --> 00:08:32.560
he wrote occasionally I get this tingling that goes down both arms.

154
00:08:32.740 --> 00:08:33.431
At the same time,

155
00:08:33.431 --> 00:08:37.360
I get a bit dizzy and get this unidentifiable metallic taste in my mouth.

156
00:08:37.600 --> 00:08:40.930
Other times it's like, I'm not only sitting at my desk doing work.

157
00:08:41.020 --> 00:08:43.060
I'm also a few feet away watching me do it.

158
00:08:43.240 --> 00:08:46.900
There's nothing like living in both the first person singular and the third

159
00:08:46.901 --> 00:08:47.740
person singular.

160
00:08:47.770 --> 00:08:51.370
What he failed to mention was that he was also the person sending Lynn Scott

161
00:08:51.400 --> 00:08:55.830
crude sexual emails from an anonymous account. Come two thousands.

162
00:08:55.860 --> 00:08:59.700
Bruce Ivan's seems to have been in the grip of a full fledged break-down he

163
00:08:59.701 --> 00:09:02.310
worried that he would not be able to resist the urge to do harm,

164
00:09:02.520 --> 00:09:06.000
but he had a split personality and he couldn't stop thinking of revenge.

165
00:09:06.090 --> 00:09:07.020
On July the 18th.

166
00:09:07.021 --> 00:09:11.460
He even informed a mental health worker that had reformulated a plans, a murder,

167
00:09:11.820 --> 00:09:15.930
Mara Lynn Scott offering how wine laced with cyanide it already mixed it.

168
00:09:15.931 --> 00:09:17.700
He said, when the counselor called the police,

169
00:09:17.701 --> 00:09:22.110
they claimed that no crime had been committed a year later in the summer of 2001

170
00:09:22.290 --> 00:09:25.980
colleagues that started noticing that bruise Ivan's was staying behind in the

171
00:09:25.981 --> 00:09:29.760
lab for long hours after work. He told friends it was peaceful down there,

172
00:09:29.790 --> 00:09:33.540
like being on the surface of Mars shortly after on September the 11th,

173
00:09:34.410 --> 00:09:37.530
2001 hijacked planes slammed into the twin towers in New York,

174
00:09:37.590 --> 00:09:41.700
the Pentagon and to field in rural Pennsylvania killing almost 3000 people.

175
00:09:41.790 --> 00:09:42.610
The following week,

176
00:09:42.610 --> 00:09:46.200
an anonymous batch of letters was quietly dropped into a new jazzy mailbox.

177
00:09:46.230 --> 00:09:47.063
And with that,

178
00:09:47.310 --> 00:09:50.640
the anthrax attacks had begun by the time they were over the U S would have

179
00:09:50.641 --> 00:09:52.710
suffered its worst bioterror instance,

180
00:09:59.640 --> 00:10:03.320
A sign that something was wrong came when Robert Stevens began to suffer chills,

181
00:10:03.530 --> 00:10:07.430
a British born or naturalized us citizen Stevens was a photo editor currently in

182
00:10:07.431 --> 00:10:11.030
the middle of a hiking vacation in North Carolina at first and his wife thought

183
00:10:11.031 --> 00:10:13.940
nothing of his illness. It was September the 29th, 2001.

184
00:10:14.190 --> 00:10:17.540
And all anyone could think about was the smoldering rubble in New York.

185
00:10:17.570 --> 00:10:20.330
The idea that terrorism might involve a plain envelope,

186
00:10:20.360 --> 00:10:24.440
like the one Stevens had come into contact with didn't even cross their minds by

187
00:10:24.441 --> 00:10:26.960
October. The second though, Stevens was in bad shape.

188
00:10:27.050 --> 00:10:29.750
He was sweating red in the face and didn't coherence.

189
00:10:29.810 --> 00:10:31.430
When he was rushed to hospital in Florida,

190
00:10:31.460 --> 00:10:34.250
doctors assumes that had contracted meningitis,

191
00:10:34.310 --> 00:10:37.880
but then an infectious disease specialist because sambal of his spinal fluid

192
00:10:38.090 --> 00:10:40.340
realized it was something much more terrifying.

193
00:10:40.820 --> 00:10:43.940
Steven's his death on October the fifth was the first anthrax death in the U S

194
00:10:44.240 --> 00:10:47.300
in 25 years. Doctors declared it a free Caxton.

195
00:10:47.750 --> 00:10:50.600
Seeing that it likely picked it up while hiking. Although two of Steven's,

196
00:10:50.720 --> 00:10:52.520
his colleagues also fell ill with anthrax.

197
00:10:52.521 --> 00:10:56.180
The public were told not to panic on October the ninth, president George W.

198
00:10:56.180 --> 00:10:59.360
Bush declared. It looks like it's a very isolated incident.

199
00:10:59.540 --> 00:11:02.690
That same day another set of letters were mailed. Four days later,

200
00:11:03.110 --> 00:11:06.710
all hell broke loose on October the 12th and anthrax is that it was opened by an

201
00:11:06.711 --> 00:11:07.730
NBC staffer.

202
00:11:07.970 --> 00:11:12.830
Inside was a note declaring nine 1101. This is next.

203
00:11:12.890 --> 00:11:17.750
Take penicillin. Now death to America, death to Israel. Allah is great.

204
00:11:17.930 --> 00:11:20.060
Three days later, an aid for Senate majority leader,

205
00:11:20.080 --> 00:11:24.230
Tom Dashell was poisoned by another letter. This one, reading nine, 1101.

206
00:11:24.440 --> 00:11:28.760
You cannot stop us. We have this anthrax. You die now. Are you afraid?

207
00:11:28.970 --> 00:11:33.110
Death to America? Death to Israel. A law has great. This last lesson,

208
00:11:33.170 --> 00:11:36.130
paralyzed Congress and the government mail service as panicked,

209
00:11:36.131 --> 00:11:36.890
swept to the media.

210
00:11:36.890 --> 00:11:40.850
Three postal workers who handled the lesser fell ill by October the 21st,

211
00:11:40.880 --> 00:11:44.330
two of them, Thomas Morris and Joseph Caseen would be debt.

212
00:11:44.450 --> 00:11:47.720
But the letter also led to something else on October the 15th,

213
00:11:47.730 --> 00:11:51.320
FBI deposited it at Fort Dietrich for analysis. One day later,

214
00:11:51.590 --> 00:11:54.370
it was handed to Dr. Bruce Ivan's in front of his colleagues.

215
00:11:54.371 --> 00:11:56.830
Ivan's examined the letter, a wet spore specialist.

216
00:11:56.831 --> 00:11:59.380
Ivan's noted the attack spores were dry denies,

217
00:11:59.381 --> 00:12:01.570
capable of spreading through the outlet gas.

218
00:12:01.630 --> 00:12:05.170
He also noted the terrifying purity of the sample. 1 trillion spores,

219
00:12:05.171 --> 00:12:09.220
a gram more than anyone at Fort Dietrich had ever seen away from the lab.

220
00:12:09.250 --> 00:12:13.120
The attacks continued coming so soon after nine 11, the letters left America,

221
00:12:13.121 --> 00:12:17.650
reeling rumors swirled that Al Qaeda were involved or Saddam Hussein.

222
00:12:17.980 --> 00:12:20.350
But then just as the panic was reaching a crescendo,

223
00:12:20.590 --> 00:12:24.280
they stopped no more anthrax letters were deposited after October the ninth.

224
00:12:24.460 --> 00:12:28.210
Although fake anthrax letters would continue to be posted way into 2002.

225
00:12:28.420 --> 00:12:30.190
The crisis was already over on November.

226
00:12:30.191 --> 00:12:34.000
The 21st 94 year old ultimately learned Grande became the last person to die of

227
00:12:34.001 --> 00:12:35.680
the anthrax attacks in total,

228
00:12:35.681 --> 00:12:40.060
the lessors claimed five lives and second 17 more including a seven month old

229
00:12:40.061 --> 00:12:43.870
baby. Not long after that, Bruce Ivan's sent his old flame. Nancy Haywood,

230
00:12:44.200 --> 00:12:45.640
a terrifying photo in its.

231
00:12:45.641 --> 00:12:50.500
He casually held a Petri dish full of anthesis bacteria while not wearing any

232
00:12:50.501 --> 00:12:54.250
protective gear. At that moment. Hagrid later said that awful moments.

233
00:12:54.760 --> 00:12:55.593
I knew it was him.

234
00:13:01.680 --> 00:13:02.280
<v 2>[Inaudible].</v>

235
00:13:02.280 --> 00:13:05.100
<v 0>Investigation named [inaudible] gained steam.</v>

236
00:13:05.250 --> 00:13:07.590
The FBI found itself in a worrying position.

237
00:13:07.650 --> 00:13:11.460
This wasn't murder committed with a regular weapon agents needed to learn about

238
00:13:11.461 --> 00:13:14.910
anthrax and fast. So FBI director, Robert Mueller, yup.

239
00:13:14.940 --> 00:13:19.110
That Robert Mueller decided to call them the experts among them was Dr. Bruce

240
00:13:19.111 --> 00:13:22.260
Ivan's. Although Haig would lead to told the FBI of her suspicions,

241
00:13:22.261 --> 00:13:23.340
the feds had ignored her.

242
00:13:23.400 --> 00:13:27.420
Now they were getting Ivan's to explain to them the bacteria he worked with.

243
00:13:27.510 --> 00:13:31.860
Unlike most of the other researchers Ivan's was eager to help. And usually,

244
00:13:31.861 --> 00:13:35.970
so when everyone else the FBI asked about potential suspect swore there's no one

245
00:13:35.971 --> 00:13:39.960
at Fort Dietrich, could've done such a thing. Ivan's happily throughout names,

246
00:13:39.970 --> 00:13:42.510
accusing colleagues and friends. It was all ones,

247
00:13:42.540 --> 00:13:45.600
but it tallied with what the feds were already thinking. Genetic testing.

248
00:13:45.720 --> 00:13:48.780
It traced the Amtrak strain back to a deadly stock known as Ames.

249
00:13:48.870 --> 00:13:52.650
Since the AME strain came from a single cow in Texas, it looks like the attack.

250
00:13:52.650 --> 00:13:55.500
It originated in the U S but thousands of researchers,

251
00:13:55.620 --> 00:13:59.940
how to access to aim stock. So the FBI had also drawn up a profile one,

252
00:13:59.941 --> 00:14:03.000
which suggested a perpetrator working in the biodefense community.

253
00:14:03.060 --> 00:14:06.510
And they were pretty sure that perpetrator was bioterror expert.

254
00:14:06.570 --> 00:14:10.770
Steven Hatfill as the FBI was pursuing Hatfill anthrax expert,

255
00:14:10.830 --> 00:14:13.560
Pat Washam was examining the attack spores.

256
00:14:13.680 --> 00:14:16.560
She noticed that the strain group four distinctive morphs,

257
00:14:16.561 --> 00:14:18.780
if left a culture long enough mutations,

258
00:14:18.781 --> 00:14:21.870
unique to that particular batch motion was ecstatic.

259
00:14:21.900 --> 00:14:24.840
Finding an AME sample that grew the same for morphs,

260
00:14:24.841 --> 00:14:27.930
which mean the attack anthrax had come from the same batch.

261
00:14:27.990 --> 00:14:32.640
All the FBI needed to do was build a database of anthrax from every aims flask,

262
00:14:32.641 --> 00:14:35.850
and then test all of them to see which carried the same mutations.

263
00:14:35.880 --> 00:14:39.660
Whichever had matching spores would belong to the killer brews. Allianz thought.

264
00:14:39.690 --> 00:14:43.110
This is a great idea. He helped draw up the selection criteria,

265
00:14:43.260 --> 00:14:47.010
including a stipulation that a wide sambal be used from each floss,

266
00:14:47.040 --> 00:14:50.340
not just the purist spores. He then hands it over his own sample.

267
00:14:50.341 --> 00:14:53.630
A strain of anthrax named RMR one zero, two, nine,

268
00:14:53.690 --> 00:14:56.420
the FBI tested it and it came back negative for morphs.

269
00:14:56.450 --> 00:14:59.750
Shortly after they raided Steven Hatfill's house on live TV.

270
00:14:59.780 --> 00:15:03.170
It was around this time that Bruce Ivan's did something very strange against

271
00:15:03.171 --> 00:15:06.920
protocol. Bruce started secretly testing his office for anthrax spores.

272
00:15:06.921 --> 00:15:10.760
Decontaminating any potential patch that he found when his colleagues learned of

273
00:15:10.761 --> 00:15:14.000
this all hell broke loose while an unbelieved Bruce was the mailer.

274
00:15:14.180 --> 00:15:17.780
His actions looked very much like those of a man trying to destroy evidence.

275
00:15:17.810 --> 00:15:19.970
There were other weird moments too. On August the eighth,

276
00:15:19.971 --> 00:15:24.350
the mailbox was located in Prince down New Jersey with anthrax spores inside the

277
00:15:24.530 --> 00:15:28.040
place where the first sessions were dropped. No one realized it at the time,

278
00:15:28.041 --> 00:15:31.460
but that mailbox was opposite. Kappa Kappa gamma, his local chapter house.

279
00:15:31.730 --> 00:15:33.320
It wasn't until fall 2003,

280
00:15:33.321 --> 00:15:37.700
that investigators began to look more seriously at Bruce Ivan's around that same

281
00:15:37.701 --> 00:15:41.420
time, power wash them tested a subsample of Ivan's is RMR one zero two,

282
00:15:41.421 --> 00:15:45.080
nine batch. One had long ago sent to another researcher to our shock,

283
00:15:45.110 --> 00:15:48.530
the subsample. It grew identical mutans to the anthrax attack.

284
00:15:48.650 --> 00:15:52.310
Shocking because RMR one zero, two nine had already been tested clear. Yeah,

285
00:15:52.311 --> 00:15:55.730
the subsample. It was so similar. They should have produced the same results.

286
00:15:55.820 --> 00:15:59.720
There was only one answer. Ivan's hadn't handed a sample of his anthrax,

287
00:15:59.750 --> 00:16:03.840
the FBI at all for Bruce Ivan's. This realization would be the beginning of.

288
00:16:03.930 --> 00:16:04.763
<v 3>Yeah.</v>

289
00:16:10.630 --> 00:16:14.950
<v 0>In late 2003 federal agents sent Ivan's his philosopher retesting this time,</v>

290
00:16:15.100 --> 00:16:16.600
all form offs grew from us,

291
00:16:16.810 --> 00:16:20.620
but it wasn't until the FBI replaced its lead investigator in 2006,

292
00:16:20.621 --> 00:16:23.500
that it drops its weak case against Steven Hatfield.

293
00:16:23.560 --> 00:16:27.820
They began pursuing Bruce Ivan's by now DNA results from the anthrax mutants

294
00:16:28.120 --> 00:16:31.420
narrowed the list of suspects down to a handful of names. One by one,

295
00:16:31.421 --> 00:16:35.260
those names had been crossed out as suspects provided alibis for September the

296
00:16:35.261 --> 00:16:37.960
eighth, 2001 on October, the ninth, 2001,

297
00:16:38.200 --> 00:16:42.490
the days the letters were mailed at lost only one name remains Bruce Ivan's

298
00:16:42.491 --> 00:16:44.440
couldn't account for his whereabouts on those days.

299
00:16:44.500 --> 00:16:47.950
Additionally we're to details about his life were beginning to seep out and

300
00:16:47.951 --> 00:16:51.160
interviews with federal agents Ivan's would volunteer damaging information

301
00:16:51.161 --> 00:16:54.250
almost like he was trying to destroy his own character. It's old.

302
00:16:54.251 --> 00:16:57.640
The feds about his obsession with Kappa Kappa gamma are about breaking into

303
00:16:57.641 --> 00:17:01.450
their homes. He told them about his harassing behavior towards Nancy Haywood.

304
00:17:01.540 --> 00:17:06.340
If his secret cross-dressing tendencies of his, fetish as 2007,

305
00:17:06.341 --> 00:17:10.390
crawled on the interviews got increasingly aggressive until it was clear.

306
00:17:10.391 --> 00:17:13.510
The mental strain was Gettings Ivan's that's September.

307
00:17:13.540 --> 00:17:16.720
He came to work with a black guy, claiming his wife had hidden it again,

308
00:17:16.750 --> 00:17:20.350
drinking wildly mixing, sleeping drugs with tequila on November.

309
00:17:20.351 --> 00:17:23.890
The first the FBI raided his home. They recovered hate mail to politicians,

310
00:17:23.891 --> 00:17:27.970
pistols and a notes declaring Ivan's would draw first blood

311
00:17:29.020 --> 00:17:30.820
lost, but they never found anthrax spores.

312
00:17:30.880 --> 00:17:34.990
Still the interrogations continued Ivan's was becoming incoherent onto

313
00:17:34.991 --> 00:17:39.130
questioning claiming he wasn't an expert and didn't understand his microbiology.

314
00:17:39.190 --> 00:17:42.280
At one point, he admitted to hacking the emails of a female coworker.

315
00:17:42.281 --> 00:17:46.360
He was obsessed with named Pat no long after some bright spark looked back at

316
00:17:46.361 --> 00:17:47.194
the end.

317
00:17:47.410 --> 00:17:51.330
[inaudible] noticed that many of the AEs and were bolded as if they might be

318
00:17:51.331 --> 00:17:54.090
referring to the nucleotide bases of DNA.

319
00:17:54.090 --> 00:17:58.860
The ones represented by the letters G C a N T lifting out the bolded letters.

320
00:17:58.861 --> 00:18:03.540
They came up with TTT AA, T T a T the amino acids.

321
00:18:03.541 --> 00:18:08.310
These referred to started with the letters P a T it seems the anthrax

322
00:18:08.640 --> 00:18:10.530
Meda had been sending a hidden message.

323
00:18:10.650 --> 00:18:14.640
As the investigation closed in Bruce's behavior got more on nerving.

324
00:18:14.790 --> 00:18:17.820
He told a friend, he could remember multiple times in his life, waking up,

325
00:18:17.850 --> 00:18:21.330
fully dressed the cockies beside him and thinking he had driven somewhere the

326
00:18:21.331 --> 00:18:23.940
previous night and committed some terrible acts online.

327
00:18:23.941 --> 00:18:27.270
He was leaving anonymous comments under videos of women talking about

328
00:18:27.271 --> 00:18:29.940
dismembering them with hatchets on March the 19th.

329
00:18:29.941 --> 00:18:33.270
He was even hospitalized after mixing a ton of pills with booze,

330
00:18:33.300 --> 00:18:37.590
possibly in an attempted suicide. Finally on June the ninth, 2008,

331
00:18:37.710 --> 00:18:40.140
Ivan's went to his group therapy session and declared this.

332
00:18:40.470 --> 00:18:43.650
It bought a Glock and body armor and was going to kill his coworkers.

333
00:18:43.710 --> 00:18:47.430
The next day, he was arrested at Fort Dietrich and placed into psychiatric care.

334
00:18:47.550 --> 00:18:50.010
When the FBI searched his home again, they found several guns,

335
00:18:50.011 --> 00:18:52.620
a Bulletproof vest and hundreds of rounds of ammunition,

336
00:18:53.010 --> 00:18:55.110
but they never get a chance to build the case against him.

337
00:18:55.350 --> 00:18:57.840
On July the 24th Ivan's was released from hospital.

338
00:18:58.050 --> 00:19:02.190
He drove to separate stores and bought huge bottles of Tylenol as each two days

339
00:19:02.191 --> 00:19:05.970
later on the evening of July, the 26th, Dr. Bruce Edward Ivan's downed,

340
00:19:06.030 --> 00:19:09.510
both bottles. You'd have to scroll note beside his bed for his wife.

341
00:19:09.750 --> 00:19:10.770
I have a terrible headache.

342
00:19:11.010 --> 00:19:14.960
I'm going to take some Tylenol and sleep in tomorrow. Please let me sleep,

343
00:19:15.470 --> 00:19:18.530
please. I want, I am on the morning of July, the 27th,

344
00:19:18.950 --> 00:19:21.470
Diane found her husband collapsed in the bathroom of the hospital.

345
00:19:21.500 --> 00:19:25.040
Doctors tried to get her to authorize an emergency liver transplant to save him.

346
00:19:25.190 --> 00:19:27.110
He doesn't want it to be saved. She replied,

347
00:19:27.410 --> 00:19:31.610
Bruce Ivan's died at 10:47 AM on July the 29th, 2008.

348
00:19:31.730 --> 00:19:32.600
Despite the FBI,

349
00:19:32.601 --> 00:19:35.750
since declaring him the sole perpetrator of the anthrax attacks,

350
00:19:35.810 --> 00:19:40.100
significant doubts remain about his guilt as the 2011 national Academy of

351
00:19:40.101 --> 00:19:43.880
sciences report. The claims the FBI overstated the scientific evidence,

352
00:19:43.910 --> 00:19:48.020
linking the attack anthrax to Ivan's a sample there's the 2014 government

353
00:19:48.021 --> 00:19:52.010
accountability office report, which declared the FBI's investigation at times,

354
00:19:52.070 --> 00:19:55.250
lacked precision consistency and adequate standards.

355
00:19:55.340 --> 00:19:59.150
Even from a layman perspective, it's clear that the case had potential holes.

356
00:19:59.360 --> 00:20:01.910
Only an anthrax expert could have pulled this attack off.

357
00:20:01.911 --> 00:20:06.650
And the FBI's anthrax collection relies on those experts submitting their own

358
00:20:06.651 --> 00:20:10.400
samples. It's not too hard to imagine how someone could have gamed that system.

359
00:20:10.490 --> 00:20:13.880
A brilliant psychopath. You could run rings around the entire FBI.

360
00:20:14.000 --> 00:20:14.833
That being said,

361
00:20:14.930 --> 00:20:18.530
the case against Ivan's remains compelling here was a highly intelligent,

362
00:20:18.620 --> 00:20:22.490
deeply troubled man with an expertise in anthrax and a history of stalking,

363
00:20:22.550 --> 00:20:25.520
acts of revenge and darkly, homicidal thoughts.

364
00:20:25.640 --> 00:20:27.380
Is it too difficult to believe that such a man,

365
00:20:27.650 --> 00:20:31.940
one who called himself an avenging angel of death could have quietly snapped,

366
00:20:32.000 --> 00:20:35.870
could have decided he was an untouchable God able to murder.

367
00:20:35.990 --> 00:20:37.760
It will because if that's the case,

368
00:20:37.910 --> 00:20:41.480
then it means the person who pulled off the deadliest biological attack in

369
00:20:41.481 --> 00:20:45.020
American history, it's still out there still living a normal life,

370
00:20:45.230 --> 00:20:47.860
perhaps even still working with anthrax.

371
00:20:48.100 --> 00:20:51.340
The story of the 2001 anthrax attacks may not be fully over,

372
00:20:51.370 --> 00:20:55.600
but what is over is the tale of Bruce Edwards Ivan's and then who may have been

373
00:20:55.601 --> 00:21:00.070
a monster or may have just been a strange, sad and creepy man.

374
00:21:00.250 --> 00:21:03.910
We may not know the truth for sure. But what we can say is that it's clear,

375
00:21:03.970 --> 00:21:08.650
Ivan's suffered at his mother's hands at the hands of the demons in his mind,

376
00:21:08.740 --> 00:21:11.320
whether he responded to that pain by inflicting even worse,

377
00:21:11.321 --> 00:21:15.190
suffering on others is something only he could have told us.

378
00:21:15.520 --> 00:21:17.140
So I'm not going to ask whether you enjoyed that video,

379
00:21:17.141 --> 00:21:19.030
but I do hope you found it. Interesting. If you did,
