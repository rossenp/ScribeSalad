00:00:23.030 --> 00:00:27.190
Rob Lewis Stevenson holds a special place in the hearts and minds of many

7
00:00:27.191 --> 00:00:31.190
readers. He often served as an introduction to real grown up books,

8
00:00:31.420 --> 00:00:35.310
stories like kidnapped and treasure islands may be considered classics,

9
00:00:35.311 --> 00:00:37.470
but they're also full of adventure and intrigue.

10
00:00:37.670 --> 00:00:40.190
The sort of stories that make you wish you are.

11
00:00:40.191 --> 00:00:42.540
One of his charact is sailing the high seas,

12
00:00:42.541 --> 00:00:45.700
looking for buried treasure fighting to reclaim your legacy.

13
00:00:46.300 --> 00:00:49.580
His stories are undoubtedly all classic works of literature.

14
00:00:49.581 --> 00:00:52.940
And while many are told against the backdrop of very real events,

15
00:00:52.970 --> 00:00:55.780
like the Jacky rising of 1745.

16
00:00:55.930 --> 00:01:00.820
There's also something about them that speaks to a sense of grand imagination

17
00:01:01.030 --> 00:01:04.010
along in for adventure and a deep sense of justice.

18
00:01:04.560 --> 00:01:09.170
It's time to pull out your spy glass and take a peak at the life of this

19
00:01:09.171 --> 00:01:12.530
19th century. Scottish writer you'll find there's a reason.

20
00:01:12.830 --> 00:01:16.170
He was so good at telling some of the tallest tales imaginable,

21
00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:20.170
setting them against epic historical backdrops. For much of his life.

22
00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:25.160
His world was only a, what he could see or dream from his sick bed.

23
00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:34.200
Childhood often lays the grounds work for a lifetime.

24
00:01:34.201 --> 00:01:37.600
And for Robert Lewis Stevenson, that was definitely the case.

25
00:01:37.900 --> 00:01:42.480
He was born on November the 13th, 1850, the only child of middle class parents.

26
00:01:42.930 --> 00:01:47.030
His mother came from a family of high education growing up in a world of church

27
00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:48.143
ministers and lawyers.

28
00:01:48.410 --> 00:01:52.550
His father had a job that most people would consider not only respectable,

29
00:01:52.650 --> 00:01:53.630
but pretty cool.

30
00:01:53.930 --> 00:01:58.310
He was an engineer and he was involved in building numerous deep sea lighthouses

31
00:01:58.320 --> 00:02:01.110
along the Scottish coast. For much of his childhood.

32
00:02:01.370 --> 00:02:04.780
The family lived at 17 Harriet Rowe in Edinburgh,

33
00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:09.060
and it's a place that anyone with a healthy respect for Georgian architecture

34
00:02:09.070 --> 00:02:13.260
would truly appreciate build some time between 1802 and 1806.

35
00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:17.660
It was still fairly new when the Stevenson's only child rooms, the halls,

36
00:02:17.850 --> 00:02:21.060
it's easy to imagine a young boy running up and down the stairs.

37
00:02:21.470 --> 00:02:24.890
Joing his way through the hallways aging adventures in the garden,

38
00:02:25.040 --> 00:02:27.370
perhaps turning the giant enamel bath.

39
00:02:27.650 --> 00:02:32.490
His fatherhood installed into a swath of ocean filled with monstrous creatures.

40
00:02:32.520 --> 00:02:33.370
Unfortunately,

41
00:02:33.600 --> 00:02:37.530
Stevenson's childhood was very different when his parents welcomed him into the

42
00:02:37.531 --> 00:02:39.930
world, he was a perfectly normal, healthy boy,

43
00:02:40.230 --> 00:02:44.010
but it wasn't long before he started suffering from severe respiratory pro

44
00:02:44.080 --> 00:02:47.120
problems. Those problems would shape not only his childhood,

45
00:02:47.700 --> 00:02:48.800
but the rest of his life.

46
00:02:49.110 --> 00:02:51.920
Stevenson spent a lot of time during his formative years,

47
00:02:52.560 --> 00:02:56.400
fussed over by anxious parents and cared for by a nurse who would end up having

48
00:02:56.520 --> 00:02:59.280
a major impact on its adult life. He wasn't,

49
00:02:59.500 --> 00:03:02.960
as one might expect hunting for very treasure in the back garden,

50
00:03:03.140 --> 00:03:06.880
or pretending to ride imaginary horses up and down the streets of the city.

51
00:03:07.150 --> 00:03:07.641
Instead,

52
00:03:07.641 --> 00:03:12.120
he spent much of his time swayed in blankets and shuls doted on by the adults

53
00:03:12.480 --> 00:03:14.440
around him learning that he was very fragile.

54
00:03:14.770 --> 00:03:18.710
Historians never quite decided just what it was. He was suffering from.

55
00:03:18.770 --> 00:03:20.950
The original diagnosis was tuberculosis,

56
00:03:21.250 --> 00:03:25.070
but today it suspected that modern medicine would come up with a diagnosis of

57
00:03:25.130 --> 00:03:26.030
bronchiectasis,

58
00:03:26.120 --> 00:03:30.310
which is a series of continuous infections resulting from damage done to the

59
00:03:30.311 --> 00:03:31.870
lining of the bronchial tubes.

60
00:03:32.070 --> 00:03:36.110
A condition often said to be made worse by the presence of dust and D particles,

61
00:03:36.250 --> 00:03:39.460
and often starting with a childhood illness. If that's the case,

62
00:03:39.730 --> 00:03:42.380
there's a sad addendum to his sickly childhood.

63
00:03:42.980 --> 00:03:46.300
His well meaning caregivers were always afraid of drafts making a ill.

64
00:03:46.440 --> 00:03:50.500
So the windows in the home were always closed with some fresh air have made a

65
00:03:50.501 --> 00:03:52.700
difference. Well, it's impossible to say.

66
00:03:52.890 --> 00:03:56.820
What we do know is that Stevenson's childhood nurse had a profound impact on his

67
00:03:56.821 --> 00:03:58.540
life. Her name was Allison Cunningham,

68
00:03:58.541 --> 00:04:01.930
but everyone just called her cumy and she lived with a household for a full two

69
00:04:01.931 --> 00:04:03.530
decades, by all accounts.

70
00:04:03.530 --> 00:04:06.330
She loved the young Stevenson as if he were her own son.

71
00:04:06.390 --> 00:04:09.770
And in addition to being a caregiver, she was also a storyteller.

72
00:04:09.840 --> 00:04:14.330
True Stevenson was often confined to his home or to the strictly regimented life

73
00:04:14.331 --> 00:04:16.890
of a health spa that only in the physical sense,

74
00:04:16.990 --> 00:04:20.320
coming entertained a young charge with various else.

75
00:04:20.760 --> 00:04:24.560
Her Herm Calvinist beliefs forms the backbone of many of the stories with which

76
00:04:24.561 --> 00:04:28.000
she regaled him. But she also told tales of ghosts,

77
00:04:28.480 --> 00:04:32.520
ghouls and other supernatural specters nights were particularly difficult for

78
00:04:32.521 --> 00:04:33.760
Stevenson. From a young age,

79
00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:38.840
she suffered from insomnia and was often kept awake for all hours by illness and

80
00:04:38.841 --> 00:04:42.870
feverish vision frequently was lulled back to sleep by his father who would sit

81
00:04:42.890 --> 00:04:46.110
by his side and invent conversations with imaginary people.

82
00:04:46.290 --> 00:04:49.670
The conversation was always Dr, but always soothing.

83
00:04:49.671 --> 00:04:54.030
Sending the young boy drifting off to sleeve escorted by mad up characters and

84
00:04:54.180 --> 00:04:56.310
conversations, plucked from thin out.

85
00:04:56.450 --> 00:05:00.470
And sometimes it was coming who filled Stevenson's sleepless nights with stories

86
00:05:00.990 --> 00:05:02.420
fuel his nighttime delirium.

87
00:05:02.800 --> 00:05:06.740
If you look at Stevenson's childhood through a more modern lens on parenting,

88
00:05:06.890 --> 00:05:10.820
it's easy to put some of the blame on the shoulders of his guardians.

89
00:05:10.920 --> 00:05:14.500
He was also susceptible to nightmares and there's one school of thought that

90
00:05:14.501 --> 00:05:18.740
suggests the mix of come's religious doctrine, ghost stories, and the fevers.

91
00:05:18.760 --> 00:05:22.930
He frequently ran fueled those isn't those sleepless nights,

92
00:05:23.110 --> 00:05:24.570
but it also feels something else.

93
00:05:24.870 --> 00:05:29.490
His imagination and imagination is not always kind still given that he started

94
00:05:29.491 --> 00:05:32.050
writing his first work at the tender age of six.

95
00:05:32.110 --> 00:05:35.170
He dictated a tale called a history of Moses to his mother.

96
00:05:35.520 --> 00:05:37.490
It's safe to say that from a very young age,

97
00:05:37.770 --> 00:05:39.890
he was enthralled by the power of the story.

98
00:05:40.270 --> 00:05:44.200
His caretaker must receive at least some of the credit for this.

99
00:05:44.430 --> 00:05:48.320
It's been suggested too, that Stevenson's illness didn't just inspire him,

100
00:05:48.420 --> 00:05:52.520
but magnified his ability to write as he grew older and more established,

101
00:05:52.540 --> 00:05:56.200
his letters began to mention the phenomenon of splitting into what he called

102
00:05:56.540 --> 00:06:01.200
myself and the other fellow. It was, he said a side effect of the high fevers.

103
00:06:01.440 --> 00:06:05.400
He so frequently suffered from meant it all sound familiar to anyone who's read

104
00:06:05.401 --> 00:06:07.640
the tale of Jack and height myself.

105
00:06:07.740 --> 00:06:11.760
He said was his rational mind while that other fellow was the side of him that

106
00:06:12.080 --> 00:06:16.280
held the darkness and the creativity for Stevenson, that wasn't scary. He,

107
00:06:16.610 --> 00:06:20.950
it drove him and he believed it helped him create the works that we still love

108
00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:21.833
today.

109
00:06:27.620 --> 00:06:28.950
With the benefit of hindsight,

110
00:06:28.951 --> 00:06:31.950
it seems like a given that Stevenson was a natural writer,

111
00:06:32.290 --> 00:06:36.310
but that belief wasn't always there and his parents certainly didn't want their

112
00:06:36.340 --> 00:06:40.740
only son throwing his life away on what is often a gamble of a career choice.

113
00:06:40.960 --> 00:06:42.380
By the time he was a teenager though,

114
00:06:42.450 --> 00:06:46.020
Stevenson was confident that his future career path would involve the written

115
00:06:46.090 --> 00:06:49.620
word, his father. On the other hand, hoped he would become an engineer.

116
00:06:49.720 --> 00:06:51.500
The third such professional in the family,

117
00:06:51.740 --> 00:06:55.500
resigned Stevenson enrolled at the university of Edinburgh to study engineering.

118
00:06:55.640 --> 00:06:58.650
It was quickly clear that going to just wasn't for him.

119
00:06:58.710 --> 00:07:01.850
And instead of spending his time attending lectures and pouring over his

120
00:07:01.851 --> 00:07:04.650
studies, he was more interested in making friends.

121
00:07:04.990 --> 00:07:08.210
And here is where one of those strange coincidences happened.

122
00:07:08.590 --> 00:07:10.010
One day as the story goes,

123
00:07:10.011 --> 00:07:12.850
Stevenson was simply walking down a street in Edinburgh.

124
00:07:13.170 --> 00:07:14.410
When he bumped into another student,

125
00:07:14.600 --> 00:07:17.850
they got to chatting and ended up heading to a Tavern for a few hours.

126
00:07:18.040 --> 00:07:21.480
Instead of going to class, the other students was JM Barry,

127
00:07:21.700 --> 00:07:26.320
who would go on to write Peter pan beyond his adventures in Netlands Barry wrote

128
00:07:26.440 --> 00:07:28.600
of Stevenson that some men of letters,

129
00:07:28.700 --> 00:07:33.440
not necessarily the greatest have an indescribable charm to which we give our

130
00:07:33.460 --> 00:07:35.600
hearts, the backend compliments, maybe,

131
00:07:35.780 --> 00:07:40.310
but other writers who met Stevenson at the same and over the course of his

132
00:07:40.311 --> 00:07:42.590
career were completely taken with him.

133
00:07:43.030 --> 00:07:46.670
Edmond Goss would later describe their first meeting in London like this.

134
00:07:46.930 --> 00:07:49.190
As Twilight came on, I tore myself away,

135
00:07:49.410 --> 00:07:53.150
but Stevenson walks with me across Hyde park, ands nearly to my house.

136
00:07:53.330 --> 00:07:57.790
He had an engagement and so had I, but I walked a mile or two back with him.

137
00:07:57.930 --> 00:08:02.260
The fountains of, to had been unsealed and they drowned the conventions.

138
00:08:02.660 --> 00:08:04.660
I came home dazzled with my new friend.

139
00:08:05.320 --> 00:08:08.940
One of the things that constantly struck those who met him was the contradictory

140
00:08:09.010 --> 00:08:13.540
duality present with him outwardly. He was incredibly frail at five foot 10,

141
00:08:13.660 --> 00:08:17.860
and he weighed only 116 pounds when he was 23 years old. When he spoke, though,

142
00:08:17.960 --> 00:08:20.130
he could easily capture the attention of a room.

143
00:08:20.390 --> 00:08:23.330
So it wasn't entirely surprising when in 1871,

144
00:08:23.470 --> 00:08:26.010
he did what many people would be terrified to do.

145
00:08:26.310 --> 00:08:29.810
He told his parents that he wasn't going to follow in the family footsteps.

146
00:08:29.811 --> 00:08:32.650
After all Stevenson was going to be a writer,

147
00:08:33.110 --> 00:08:36.530
anyone who has ever dropped a bombshell like that on their parents can probably

148
00:08:36.531 --> 00:08:37.930
imagine how well it went over,

149
00:08:38.270 --> 00:08:41.480
but Stevenson's parents weren completely opposed to the idea.

150
00:08:41.550 --> 00:08:44.280
They only insisted that Stevenson have a backup plan.

151
00:08:44.540 --> 00:08:48.880
So his parents asked him to study law just in case the writing thing didn't take

152
00:08:48.881 --> 00:08:53.200
off. Like he thought it would, he agreed completing his law degree in 1875.

153
00:08:53.620 --> 00:08:55.880
Now guys, just before I get into the, the rest of today's video,

154
00:08:55.960 --> 00:08:59.240
I do wanna take a quick moment to tell you about today's sponsor audible.

155
00:08:59.700 --> 00:09:02.640
Now you guys have probably heard of audible you're on the internet watching this

156
00:09:02.641 --> 00:09:04.600
video. So pretty sure you have,

157
00:09:04.870 --> 00:09:08.880
they have the largest selection of audio books in the world bar, none.

158
00:09:08.940 --> 00:09:09.761
And with that in mind,

159
00:09:09.761 --> 00:09:12.880
you can pick up a whole bunch of Robert Lewis Stevenson's books on audible.

160
00:09:13.020 --> 00:09:16.310
Indeed. They don't just have these straight narrat versions of the books,

161
00:09:16.330 --> 00:09:20.430
but they've also got fantastic dramatizations and other things like that.

162
00:09:20.490 --> 00:09:25.150
So definitely check those out. If you might be interested or personally from me,

163
00:09:25.350 --> 00:09:27.310
I just finished a completely different book,

164
00:09:27.311 --> 00:09:29.630
which was in the plaques by Steven Levy,

165
00:09:29.631 --> 00:09:33.070
which is all about Google and it's history and ideas. So yeah,

166
00:09:33.071 --> 00:09:36.740

180
00:10:23.620 --> 00:10:27.440
It was just a year after graduating from law school that Stevenson's life would

181
00:10:27.441 --> 00:10:30.640
drastically change. It started with his one for adventure.

182
00:10:30.910 --> 00:10:32.080
Imagination was wonderful,

183
00:10:32.081 --> 00:10:35.600
but he wanted to experience all the things he had dreamed about as a child.

184
00:10:35.980 --> 00:10:39.630
He had first and a canoe trip beginning in ANW and ending in the north of

185
00:10:39.631 --> 00:10:40.710
France. Afterwards,

186
00:10:40.711 --> 00:10:44.070
he headed off to a small town south of Paris called GRE solo.

187
00:10:44.290 --> 00:10:45.590
It wasn't a Ren choice.

188
00:10:45.770 --> 00:10:48.870
The town was a favorite among the artistic and Bohemian communities.

189
00:10:48.890 --> 00:10:52.710
And Stevenson already had a cousin living there, Robert a mare,

190
00:10:52.930 --> 00:10:55.990
but it was here also that he would meet the love of his life,

191
00:10:56.470 --> 00:11:00.700
but any then of gr Osborne ended up in France after a fairly epic story of her

192
00:11:00.701 --> 00:11:02.540
own. When she was only 17 years old,

193
00:11:02.600 --> 00:11:06.420
she married an American military officer named Samuel Osborne following the

194
00:11:06.580 --> 00:11:07.413
American civil war.

195
00:11:07.480 --> 00:11:10.660
He headed off to seek his fortune in the silver minds of Nevada.

196
00:11:10.800 --> 00:11:14.340
He told his wife and daughter to join him and they did Fannie didn't like the

197
00:11:14.500 --> 00:11:16.900
west at all. The Indiana native bought two more children,

198
00:11:17.300 --> 00:11:20.810
but has husbands proved less than honorable sick of his cheating and his

199
00:11:20.811 --> 00:11:22.690
prolonged mysterious disappearances.

200
00:11:22.950 --> 00:11:27.410
She packed up her children and left Nova for Belgium. This was 1875.

201
00:11:27.730 --> 00:11:30.850
It was a time when most women wouldn't have even considered such a thing.

202
00:11:31.330 --> 00:11:35.570
And the first obstacle they faced showed just how different times were she and

203
00:11:35.571 --> 00:11:38.280
her daughter had planned on studying art in Anne were up,

204
00:11:38.380 --> 00:11:41.240
but were told that women were not allowed to enroll in art schools.

205
00:11:41.470 --> 00:11:44.800
They moved on to Paris, but when her youngest son took hill and died,

206
00:11:44.940 --> 00:11:47.960
she retired to a small town in the countryside with her remaining children.

207
00:11:48.380 --> 00:11:52.280
The town of course, was that small artist's community of GRE solo.

208
00:11:52.580 --> 00:11:55.960
And that's where she met Stevenson. They had a lot working against them.

209
00:11:56.020 --> 00:11:57.560
She was 11 years older than him.

210
00:11:57.620 --> 00:12:01.200
She had two children already and technically she was still married to Osborne

211
00:12:01.270 --> 00:12:01.881
Stevenson.

212
00:12:01.881 --> 00:12:05.920
Meanwhile was fresh out of law school had no job or career to speak of and was

213
00:12:05.921 --> 00:12:08.880
still trying to figure out just how he was going to turn this whole writing

214
00:12:08.881 --> 00:12:10.120
thing into a livelihood.

215
00:12:10.500 --> 00:12:13.830
He had already written one book based on his earlier canoe trip,

216
00:12:13.930 --> 00:12:17.830
but one book won't support, family Stevenson, courted Fanny. For two years,

217
00:12:17.980 --> 00:12:19.270
they enjoyed each other's company,

218
00:12:19.410 --> 00:12:22.630
but the presence of another man in her life eventually forced Fannie to

219
00:12:22.631 --> 00:12:24.150
reconsider the one she'd left behind.

220
00:12:24.490 --> 00:12:27.830
She decided to return to California and give her husband another chance

221
00:12:28.220 --> 00:12:31.870
abandoned by the woman. He loved Stevenson set out another adventure.

222
00:12:32.210 --> 00:12:36.420
One that would become the inspiration for his second book travels with a donkey

223
00:12:36.440 --> 00:12:38.260
in the events for 12 days,

224
00:12:38.400 --> 00:12:42.260
he hiked to the events with the help of a donkey who carried his baggage for

225
00:12:42.261 --> 00:12:46.140
him. He covered 120 miles of difficult country, which wasn't just ambitious.

226
00:12:46.480 --> 00:12:49.100
It was outright dangerous. Not everyone was a fan of the book,

227
00:12:49.101 --> 00:12:52.460
particularly because of the treatment of its constitu character.

228
00:12:52.690 --> 00:12:55.690
When Stevenson bought his donkey, he named her modesty.

229
00:12:55.790 --> 00:12:59.770
And by the time the 12 days were over, her value had been cut in half,

230
00:12:59.800 --> 00:13:03.210
getting her to move along involved, Stevenson, delivering regular blows,

231
00:13:03.211 --> 00:13:05.690
and one critic summed up just how horrible it was.

232
00:13:05.691 --> 00:13:10.050
Writing raw eggs and bleeding skin do not move him in the least.

233
00:13:10.470 --> 00:13:14.640
The trip had been taken at least in part, in an attempt to heal a broken hearts,

234
00:13:14.641 --> 00:13:17.320
but their story wasn't over yet in 1879,

235
00:13:17.321 --> 00:13:20.280
Stevenson received a telegram from California. Fannie was sick.

236
00:13:20.340 --> 00:13:24.200
Her husband hadn't changed and she regretted ever leaving Europe in a grand

237
00:13:24.201 --> 00:13:26.480
gesture. That really is the staff of a classic romance,

238
00:13:26.570 --> 00:13:30.360
novel Stevenson hopped on a shipping Glasgow and sailed for America.

239
00:13:30.570 --> 00:13:31.800
After landing in New York,

240
00:13:31.820 --> 00:13:34.950
he took a train all the way from the east coast to the west coast.

241
00:13:35.170 --> 00:13:37.510
And by the time he reached her in Montey, California,

242
00:13:37.970 --> 00:13:41.750
the journey had taken a terrifying toll on his already fragile health,

243
00:13:42.130 --> 00:13:43.710
but Fafa and her children,

244
00:13:44.010 --> 00:13:47.870
it seemed worth every sacrifice by December of 1879,

245
00:13:47.890 --> 00:13:50.990
she had formally divorced Samuel Osborn, less than six months later,

246
00:13:51.450 --> 00:13:52.590
she married Stevenson.

247
00:13:52.880 --> 00:13:56.580
Those early months were filled with extreme heart lows Stevenson.

248
00:13:56.640 --> 00:14:01.100
And his new bride stayed in Napa valley for a time where he wrote the Silverado

249
00:14:01.130 --> 00:14:04.700
squatters, but it was also there that he became seriously ill.

250
00:14:04.701 --> 00:14:07.980
As he developed a new symptom. He began to cough up blood

251
00:14:14.530 --> 00:14:15.420
Stevenson's poor,

252
00:14:15.780 --> 00:14:19.770
never really rebounded after the long trip from Scotland to California and for

253
00:14:19.771 --> 00:14:20.690
the remainder of his life,

254
00:14:20.710 --> 00:14:24.090
the little family moved several times in an attempt to find a climate more

255
00:14:24.091 --> 00:14:27.570
agreeable to his delicate constitution. The first stop was England,

256
00:14:27.571 --> 00:14:30.290
where they lived until 1887, say for the winters,

257
00:14:30.291 --> 00:14:32.650
which were spent in the south of France Stevenson,

258
00:14:32.651 --> 00:14:35.770
supported his family by writing assays and bits of travel journalism,

259
00:14:36.080 --> 00:14:39.080
providing readers with his thoughts on dogs, umbrellas,

260
00:14:39.081 --> 00:14:41.920
and a litany of other common observations. However,

261
00:14:41.990 --> 00:14:45.560
this time is more associated with the publication of his major career

262
00:14:45.561 --> 00:14:48.840
highlights, hero Rosen published treasure island in 1883.

263
00:14:48.990 --> 00:14:53.960
Plus the strange case of Dr Jackel and Mr. Hyde and kidnapped both in 1886,

264
00:14:54.360 --> 00:14:57.280
treasure island in particular came from a brilliant moment of inspiration.

265
00:14:57.500 --> 00:15:01.880
The family was away on holiday staying in a small Scottish town and the day was

266
00:15:01.970 --> 00:15:04.400
rainy and dreary. The story varies a bit.

267
00:15:04.470 --> 00:15:08.520
Some say Stevenson was the ones that first draw the map of a mysterious island

268
00:15:08.730 --> 00:15:12.870
while his stepson Lloyd would later claim it was he who drew it either way.

269
00:15:13.030 --> 00:15:16.390
A map was drawn and Stevenson began to name points of interest,

270
00:15:17.150 --> 00:15:18.430
Spyglass hill skeleton islands.

271
00:15:18.431 --> 00:15:22.710
Then someone added three red crosses and a title of treasure islands.

272
00:15:23.030 --> 00:15:23.850
And the foundation,

273
00:15:23.850 --> 00:15:27.270
one of the literary world's most beloved pirate tales was formed,

274
00:15:28.110 --> 00:15:29.190
ends his a little side.

275
00:15:29.290 --> 00:15:33.060
The map included in various edit of treasure islands was not the original,

276
00:15:33.170 --> 00:15:36.940
that original map was lost somewhere between submitting it to the publisher and

277
00:15:36.941 --> 00:15:40.380
getting the book printed while Stevenson did redraw the map himself.

278
00:15:40.520 --> 00:15:42.740
He was reportedly never quite happy with it.

279
00:15:42.760 --> 00:15:46.340
And the fact that the original map for treasure island is actually lost,

280
00:15:46.480 --> 00:15:49.740
is well kind of appropriate in 1880 sevens.

281
00:15:49.741 --> 00:15:53.650
Stevenson's father died with real reason to stand Britain any longer. You know,

282
00:15:53.651 --> 00:15:57.010
his family left first for a year in America, then to the south Pacific.

283
00:15:57.100 --> 00:16:01.330
Eventually they reached Samoa where they decided to stay at least for a moment

284
00:16:01.630 --> 00:16:05.650
in Samoa. He not only wrote a lot often from the confines of a sick bet,

285
00:16:05.710 --> 00:16:08.010
but he also became a treasured member of the community.

286
00:16:08.270 --> 00:16:10.730
He immersed himself in local politics and activism,

287
00:16:10.950 --> 00:16:14.960
and was even given the Thai of twisted Tyler or the tell of tales.

288
00:16:15.250 --> 00:16:19.520
Originally Samoa had just been another stop on the itinerary with no real

289
00:16:19.521 --> 00:16:20.640
intention of staying there,

290
00:16:20.700 --> 00:16:24.400
but Stevenson gradually came to the conclusion that the climates would be good

291
00:16:24.401 --> 00:16:26.640
for his health. With his mind made up Stevenson,

292
00:16:26.641 --> 00:16:30.800
bought a 300 acre estate and settled into the place that Stevenson and Fanny

293
00:16:31.080 --> 00:16:34.950
considered to be their first real home. Sadly, it would also be their last

294
00:16:41.650 --> 00:16:45.390
On the surface. Their lives should have been idyllic, locals and travelers,

295
00:16:45.391 --> 00:16:48.790
particularly those who had made the journey to Samoa from Scotland were always

296
00:16:48.791 --> 00:16:49.750
welcome at the estate.

297
00:16:49.860 --> 00:16:54.460
They celebrated everything from birthdays to American than food and songs were

298
00:16:54.461 --> 00:16:58.180
more plentiful than the guests at had around 15 servants working to keep the

299
00:16:58.181 --> 00:17:02.220
estate running and Stevenson himself found solace in working the land he took to

300
00:17:02.221 --> 00:17:05.900
gardening and weeding in particular one's writing farming is amusing.

301
00:17:05.910 --> 00:17:09.460
Literature save in results is intolerably stupid.

302
00:17:09.610 --> 00:17:12.540
Nothing is so interesting as weeding.

303
00:17:13.180 --> 00:17:15.170
There was are unhappy undercurrent though,

304
00:17:15.610 --> 00:17:17.170
Fannie aspired to be an artist of her own.

305
00:17:17.350 --> 00:17:20.330
And when he told her that she had the soul of a peasant,

306
00:17:20.590 --> 00:17:24.450
she was extraordinarily offended. Stevenson had meant it as a compliment,

307
00:17:24.850 --> 00:17:28.970
watching gardeners and modernists work to plant and cultivate the land had made

308
00:17:28.971 --> 00:17:31.970
him wonder if writing was real work, physical labor.

309
00:17:32.070 --> 00:17:36.440
It seemed to him was a more early endeavor, but Fannie didn't take it that way.

310
00:17:36.580 --> 00:17:40.760
And the artistic anxiety she had always struggled with only got worse.

311
00:17:41.120 --> 00:17:45.200
Fannie's very presence in Stevenson's life continued to be controversial while

312
00:17:45.270 --> 00:17:47.520
Stevenson's parents had come to accept her.

313
00:17:47.840 --> 00:17:51.160
This widow mother lived with them in Samoa. His friends did not.

314
00:17:51.350 --> 00:17:53.480
They resented her for telling friends they couldn't visit.

315
00:17:53.620 --> 00:17:55.640
And for inserting herself into his work,

316
00:17:56.320 --> 00:17:59.720
Chilon claims that she was responsible for the success of Jacqueline Hyde,

317
00:17:59.760 --> 00:18:03.960
claiming that she had insisted he completely rewrite the first draft of the work

318
00:18:04.090 --> 00:18:07.720
while there was no love loss between Fanny and Stevenson's friends there,

319
00:18:07.721 --> 00:18:11.310
little doubt, they truly loved each other. But as the years of the, uh,

320
00:18:11.311 --> 00:18:12.590
state and Samoa went on,

321
00:18:13.150 --> 00:18:16.510
Fanny continued to struggle more and more with a nervous illness that had

322
00:18:16.511 --> 00:18:18.590
plagued after years, as for Stevenson,

323
00:18:18.650 --> 00:18:21.670
he did continue to write while living at the island estate,

324
00:18:21.930 --> 00:18:24.750
but he would never match the success of his earlier works.

325
00:18:24.860 --> 00:18:28.910
Most of his later publications were historical works or travel essays. And when,

326
00:18:29.260 --> 00:18:30.100
and they didn't take off,

327
00:18:30.160 --> 00:18:33.980
he grew increasingly worried about money that stress ratcheted it up with the

328
00:18:33.981 --> 00:18:37.500
release of one of his histories that detailed the fight between colonial powers

329
00:18:37.501 --> 00:18:40.380
that were vying for control of the islands. When the book was published,

330
00:18:40.440 --> 00:18:43.660
he began to worry that it was so controversial that he could be deported

331
00:18:44.090 --> 00:18:45.980
Stevenson's stress and health issues.

332
00:18:45.981 --> 00:18:48.220
They finally had critical mass on December the third,

333
00:18:48.500 --> 00:18:52.330
1894 here were worked on a fiction project in the morning and wrote some letters

334
00:18:52.331 --> 00:18:55.170
in the afternoon later, he helped Fannie make some mayonnaise.

335
00:18:55.310 --> 00:18:58.290
That's what he was doing when he collapsed. And he was dead by evening,

336
00:18:58.510 --> 00:18:59.890
likely of a cerebral hemorrhage.

337
00:19:00.570 --> 00:19:04.450
Rob Lewis Stevenson was buried on the island and his grave is marked by a stone

338
00:19:04.470 --> 00:19:05.410
on which is inscribed.

339
00:19:05.411 --> 00:19:08.890
The epi avatar that he wrote for himself under the wide and star sky,

340
00:19:09.190 --> 00:19:13.600
dig the grave and let me lie. Glad I did life and gladly die.

341
00:19:13.860 --> 00:19:18.400
And I laid me down with a, will this be the verse you grave for me here?

342
00:19:18.840 --> 00:19:23.720
He lies where he longed to be home is the sailor home from the sea and the

343
00:19:23.721 --> 00:19:28.040
hunter home from the hill Fanny and her children only stayed on the estate for a

344
00:19:28.041 --> 00:19:31.630
few months after his death. Although her ashes were buried beside him,

345
00:19:31.631 --> 00:19:34.790
after her passing in 1914, when they were reunited,

346
00:19:34.810 --> 00:19:39.230
it was to a huge celebration on Samoa as they were laid to rest in what has been

347
00:19:39.231 --> 00:19:42.510
called the most inaccesible grave in English letters.

348
00:19:42.860 --> 00:19:46.990
It's an appropriate description for the final resting place of the man who wrote

349
00:19:47.010 --> 00:19:51.700
the world's most famous beloved tale of pirates and treasure.
