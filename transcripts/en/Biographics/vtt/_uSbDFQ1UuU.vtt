00:00:02.241 --> 00:00:05.480
They're amazing all in one platform through the link of description below more

3
00:00:05.481 --> 00:00:06.314
on them in a bit,

4
00:00:11.990 --> 00:00:16.000
Picture the scene you're lost in a snow storm in one of the coldest places on

5
00:00:16.001 --> 00:00:18.440
the planet. You take refuge inside a small curve of,

6
00:00:18.740 --> 00:00:22.750
but the falling snow soon traps you in, you have to dig yourself out,

7
00:00:23.310 --> 00:00:25.350
but you don't any tools. You try using your hands,

8
00:00:25.630 --> 00:00:28.110
but you start to lose feeling in your fingers. After just a few minutes,

9
00:00:28.490 --> 00:00:31.190
you need something solid and relatively sharp.

10
00:00:31.770 --> 00:00:35.390
So what do you do if your name was Peter Fren, then the correct answer was,

11
00:00:35.590 --> 00:00:39.750
do you freeze your excrements in the shape of a chisel and dig yourself out of

12
00:00:39.751 --> 00:00:43.620
your IC tomb? And when he wasn't busy exploring the Arctic waste,

13
00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:47.460
frien was biting the Nazis or building a career in Hollywood. Yes.

14
00:00:47.461 --> 00:00:51.780
The poop story is one of the most famous tales in the ans of polar exploration,

15
00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:56.140
but it is just one of the many adventures of today's subject, Danish Explorer,

16
00:00:56.430 --> 00:00:57.263
Peter fre,

17
00:01:03.290 --> 00:01:06.090
Loren, Peter Alfred FRN was born on February the 20th,

18
00:01:06.290 --> 00:01:09.810
1886 in the city of NACO being foster in Denmark,

19
00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:14.610
one of seven children of Loren Bens, Andreen, and Anne re Moin,

20
00:01:14.611 --> 00:01:17.650
according to his own admission in his memoirs, VA Viking.

21
00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:20.970
Our main source of information today F Fren was a very ugly baby.

22
00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:22.600
It said that in last few years,

23
00:01:22.601 --> 00:01:25.920
the biggest compliment he ever received was being called a funny little thing,

24
00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:29.640
and that his mother would always take the family dog, big yellow,

25
00:01:29.770 --> 00:01:34.200
angry Martin walks with baby Peter so that people would be afraid to approach

26
00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:35.760
and look inside the stroller.

27
00:01:35.761 --> 00:01:39.880
That being said young Peter was very devoted to his parents and vice versa and

28
00:01:40.080 --> 00:01:43.670
is said that they were both excellent storytellers it from his mother that FRN

29
00:01:43.730 --> 00:01:45.470
got his first taste of adventure.

30
00:01:45.870 --> 00:01:49.310
As she often regaled him and his siblings with stories of her own father who had

31
00:01:49.311 --> 00:01:52.510
been a sailor with a life full of exciting exploits,

32
00:01:52.511 --> 00:01:55.190
including taking part in revolutions in south America.

33
00:01:55.750 --> 00:01:58.350
Another important influence on his life was his uncle Kristin,

34
00:01:58.570 --> 00:02:02.590
who had used to be a gold prospector in Australia and would tell stories of his

35
00:02:02.591 --> 00:02:05.300
adventure is whenever the family visited as a child,

36
00:02:05.301 --> 00:02:06.900
Peter developed an interest in science.

37
00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:10.260
He liked to conduct experiments that more often than not led to mine,

38
00:02:10.261 --> 00:02:12.260
a property damage or mild physical harm,

39
00:02:12.320 --> 00:02:15.500
his natural curiosity persuaded him to pursue higher learning.

40
00:02:15.680 --> 00:02:19.860
So FRN enrolled at the university of Copenhagen to study medical science after

41
00:02:19.861 --> 00:02:21.500
graduating from high school. However,

42
00:02:21.560 --> 00:02:25.130
it did not take long for Peter to discuss other that the medical career was not

43
00:02:25.131 --> 00:02:27.570
for him. The other students were smarter than him. More eloquent,

44
00:02:27.571 --> 00:02:29.090
better mannered, and better dressed.

45
00:02:29.150 --> 00:02:33.090
He started to fit in better when he joined an acting group that staged series of

46
00:02:33.091 --> 00:02:33.630
comedies.

47
00:02:33.630 --> 00:02:38.210
One of them was about a Danish Explorer named Ludvig Myas eon and

48
00:02:38.280 --> 00:02:41.570
hearing about his exploits peaked Frick's interest.

49
00:02:41.620 --> 00:02:44.280
Eventually he met this man who was supporting of,

50
00:02:44.440 --> 00:02:48.160
of the idea of Freon following in his footsteps that became the med students,

51
00:02:48.161 --> 00:02:49.520
new ambition, a life of an adventure,

52
00:02:49.910 --> 00:02:53.320
exploring the unknown reaches of the planet before doing that. However,

53
00:02:54.080 --> 00:02:56.840
Freon realized that it would be a good idea for him to finish his studies,

54
00:02:56.841 --> 00:03:00.920
which he did graduating with a PhD C or candidate in philosophy,

55
00:03:01.160 --> 00:03:04.560
a master's level degree awarded in Scandinavia with the studies outta the way.

56
00:03:05.040 --> 00:03:07.120
Erickson agreed to take Peter on his next expedition,

57
00:03:07.121 --> 00:03:11.240
which was intended to explore and chart the last remaining unknown parts of

58
00:03:11.241 --> 00:03:13.880
Greenlands on its Northeast coastline. However,

59
00:03:14.520 --> 00:03:19.110
fro soon discovered a common problem that plagued almost every Explorer money

60
00:03:19.230 --> 00:03:22.830
Erickson was having trouble securing the funding necessary for his expedition,

61
00:03:22.831 --> 00:03:26.230
eventually king Christie and the 10th of Denmark agreed to cover half of the

62
00:03:26.231 --> 00:03:29.430
costs, but the other half needed to come from private benefactors.

63
00:03:30.110 --> 00:03:34.070
BS Erickson found one incredibly puritanical businessman willing to give him the

64
00:03:34.071 --> 00:03:34.250
money,

65
00:03:34.250 --> 00:03:37.830
but he confronted the Explorer after hearing the scandalous rumor that during

66
00:03:37.850 --> 00:03:42.620
the summer E had the goal to go to the beach and bathe in the company of a

67
00:03:42.621 --> 00:03:47.500
woman. Clearly the Explorer was nothing but a scour and a corruptor of public

68
00:03:47.840 --> 00:03:50.260
morals. So the offer was rescinded.

69
00:03:50.270 --> 00:03:53.940
Eventually Harrison found other backers who had less stringent views on beach

70
00:03:54.500 --> 00:03:57.340
etiquette and obtained the funding necessary for the expedition. Afterwards,

71
00:03:57.360 --> 00:04:01.610
he rounded up his crew and secured a ship Magine, which was E christens.

72
00:04:01.630 --> 00:04:04.130
The Denmark there's the most junior member of the crew.

73
00:04:04.150 --> 00:04:07.250
The 20 year old Peter Freon would work in the engine room,

74
00:04:07.251 --> 00:04:09.610
mainly as a Stoker in August, 1906,

75
00:04:09.850 --> 00:04:13.610
the ship set sell a Greenlands and the Denmark expedition began

76
00:04:18.590 --> 00:04:22.480
The Denmark expedition to be a fatal disaster, right from the start.

77
00:04:22.481 --> 00:04:25.760
There were problems. The ship was old and slow and the wood was rotten.

78
00:04:25.780 --> 00:04:28.720
So after just three days at sea, the GAFE broke.

79
00:04:28.960 --> 00:04:31.720
So the D Mar hater dark in port again, to get it repaired.

80
00:04:32.280 --> 00:04:35.080
Ericson immediately told the newspapers that they encountered a violent storm,

81
00:04:35.081 --> 00:04:38.680
but his claim was counted by other captains who sailed the same waters and knew

82
00:04:38.681 --> 00:04:39.640
the truth. Meanwhile,

83
00:04:39.641 --> 00:04:43.510
the extra repairs meant extra expenses and the financial backers considered

84
00:04:43.511 --> 00:04:45.070
removing Erickson from his command,

85
00:04:45.130 --> 00:04:49.790
or even canceling the expedition entirely the Explorer set sale as quickly as

86
00:04:49.950 --> 00:04:51.950
possible to avoid these outcomes.

87
00:04:52.010 --> 00:04:54.830
The expedition arrived in Greenland toward the end of August. However,

88
00:04:54.831 --> 00:04:57.510
they couldn't simply rush out into unexplored territory,

89
00:04:57.660 --> 00:04:58.710
that to wait for spring,

90
00:04:58.711 --> 00:05:01.780
which meant that they would be spending the winter in the Arctic.

91
00:05:02.130 --> 00:05:05.860
This was a dream come true for Peter fre and his tasks mainly involved doing

92
00:05:05.861 --> 00:05:08.940
manual labor and going on hunting trips for bears and wares,

93
00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:11.980
but also serving as an assistant to the expedition's doctor.

94
00:05:11.980 --> 00:05:15.020
Thanks to his medical degree. The doctor was Alfred Wang,

95
00:05:15.320 --> 00:05:18.740
the scientist who had later achieve fame for his hypothesis on continental

96
00:05:18.830 --> 00:05:22.290
drift, to precursor, to our current model of tectonics,

97
00:05:22.291 --> 00:05:25.890
being responsible for the large scale motion of continents during their winter

98
00:05:26.290 --> 00:05:26.310
stay.

99
00:05:26.310 --> 00:05:30.330
The most serious problem occurred when several men fell ill after eating at

100
00:05:30.331 --> 00:05:33.090
tainted bears liver, but everyone eventually recovered.

101
00:05:33.091 --> 00:05:36.690
It was the first of many lessons that Fren learned about polar survival from the

102
00:05:36.691 --> 00:05:39.610
local Greenland Inuits who never ate the liver,

103
00:05:39.800 --> 00:05:43.600
even though only some of them were poisonous by finally spring arrived and 10

104
00:05:43.620 --> 00:05:48.120
man teams set off on dog sleds at the end of March being a complete novice in

105
00:05:48.200 --> 00:05:50.320
Arctic exploration. Roy was not among them,

106
00:05:50.380 --> 00:05:53.680
but this might have been for the best because the expedition wanted to chart

107
00:05:53.681 --> 00:05:57.520
several areas. Multiple teams split up at theirs points during the Trek.

108
00:05:57.580 --> 00:05:57.990
The longest,

109
00:05:57.990 --> 00:06:01.560
most difficult journey was left to a three man team consisting of cartographer.

110
00:06:01.620 --> 00:06:05.080
Neil's Peter ho Hagen, Explorer, Jorgen Bruns,

111
00:06:05.100 --> 00:06:08.840
and the leader of the expedition Ludvig mileage Erickson. Unfortunately,

112
00:06:08.900 --> 00:06:10.680
all three men perished on their crossing.

113
00:06:10.681 --> 00:06:14.480
Thanks mainly to bad weather conditions, pour hunting and incorrect maps.

114
00:06:14.550 --> 00:06:16.200
Despite the tragic loss of life, the,

115
00:06:16.530 --> 00:06:20.670
and was technically a success since it accomplished its goals before his death

116
00:06:21.150 --> 00:06:24.670
Hagen mapped out the unfamiliar territory and Erickson kept detailed notes of

117
00:06:24.671 --> 00:06:28.150
their journey. Both the maps and the diary were later recovered by another team.

118
00:06:28.390 --> 00:06:31.550
Although only Brolin's body was ever found in 1908,

119
00:06:31.551 --> 00:06:33.270
the survivors made their way back to Denmark,

120
00:06:33.271 --> 00:06:37.620
where they received heroes welcome and were decorated with the order merits by

121
00:06:37.621 --> 00:06:41.220
the new king Frederick, the eighth FN had a brief attempt to resume his studies,

122
00:06:41.360 --> 00:06:44.820
but he proved to be way too restless to ever Excel in a classroom.

123
00:06:45.120 --> 00:06:49.260
It was clear that seeing firsthand how Arctic exploration could easily prove

124
00:06:49.390 --> 00:06:51.940
fatal did nothing to dampen his adventurous spirit.

125
00:06:52.290 --> 00:06:55.820
Only another trip to the cold north, which satisfy him. Of course,

126
00:06:55.821 --> 00:06:57.970
such expeditions do not happen at every day.

127
00:06:57.971 --> 00:06:59.730
So until the opportunity presented itself,

128
00:06:59.970 --> 00:07:02.090
F FRN needed to find some way to make a living.

129
00:07:02.230 --> 00:07:04.650
He found his good fortune in 1909,

130
00:07:04.651 --> 00:07:08.210
when words started spreading around the globe that American Explorer Frederick

131
00:07:08.400 --> 00:07:10.850
cook had become the first person to reach the north pole.

132
00:07:11.370 --> 00:07:14.170
Fricken received a message from the editor of Denmark's largest newspaper

133
00:07:14.200 --> 00:07:16.130
Politicon who wanted to cover the story,

134
00:07:16.310 --> 00:07:20.000
but did not have anyone on staff who knew anything about the north pole.

135
00:07:20.100 --> 00:07:22.880
He commissioned F to write an article about Cook's accomplishments,

136
00:07:22.881 --> 00:07:25.680
and it was good enough that he put the Y Explorer on the payroll.

137
00:07:26.160 --> 00:07:27.720
A source of income was well and good,

138
00:07:28.020 --> 00:07:31.080
but what freaking really wanted was to leave on another expedition.

139
00:07:31.080 --> 00:07:34.400
Fortunately for him, it just befriend. You can a Ramer person.

140
00:07:34.620 --> 00:07:39.470
He described as the one man who came to me more to me than the other man in my

141
00:07:39.471 --> 00:07:42.350
whole life Rasmussin was an Explorer like FRN,

142
00:07:42.351 --> 00:07:46.470
but he was already a respected veteran by the time FRN left on his first trip,

143
00:07:46.910 --> 00:07:50.070
plus Rasmussin was born and grew up in Greenland among the Inuit.

144
00:07:50.090 --> 00:07:53.870
So he learned all of the tips and tricks of Arctic survival from a young age

145
00:07:54.270 --> 00:07:57.670
together, the two of them would embark on a decade long trip to Greenland. Now,

146
00:07:57.671 --> 00:08:01.420

171
00:09:21.810 --> 00:09:25.030
In 1910, the dynamic du left on their first voyage.

172
00:09:25.031 --> 00:09:26.550
The Arctic together on this journey,

173
00:09:26.870 --> 00:09:30.070
their goal was to set up the most northly trading post in the world,

174
00:09:30.080 --> 00:09:31.670
which would serve two purposes.

175
00:09:32.050 --> 00:09:35.780
One to act as a home base for future missions and two to trade with the local

176
00:09:35.990 --> 00:09:39.540
Inuit who were eager to exchange first for tools on this occasion,

177
00:09:40.060 --> 00:09:42.540
fre Rasmuson went to Greenland alone.

178
00:09:42.570 --> 00:09:45.660
They knew that they could live among the local since they were all friends with

179
00:09:46.020 --> 00:09:47.220
Rasmuson. In fact,

180
00:09:47.360 --> 00:09:51.140
the first thing they had to do when they arrived was to travel from house to

181
00:09:51.141 --> 00:09:54.500
house, accepting gifts of food, because refusing even just one person,

182
00:09:54.501 --> 00:09:56.370
would've been a great insult,

183
00:09:56.400 --> 00:10:00.490
therefore that Danish explorers stuffed themselves with caribou wars and other

184
00:10:00.500 --> 00:10:02.810
Meads until they collapsed and fell asleep.

185
00:10:02.880 --> 00:10:05.850
That was the start of another winter spent in Greenland for Freon.

186
00:10:06.130 --> 00:10:09.570
The Rasmus built a cabin for themselves and often went hunting with the locals.

187
00:10:09.571 --> 00:10:13.090
They established a trading post in the Northwest of Greenlands and named it Thun

188
00:10:13.091 --> 00:10:14.890
because in ancient Roman cartography,

189
00:10:15.040 --> 00:10:17.080
that was the term for the far this north location.

190
00:10:17.300 --> 00:10:19.440
It proved to be a very popular spot within youit.

191
00:10:19.441 --> 00:10:22.680
Since at the time there had few options when it came to trading further and

192
00:10:22.681 --> 00:10:24.200
modern tools with each passing day,

193
00:10:24.640 --> 00:10:27.840
fricken felt more a home in Greenland and his desire to ever return to Denmark

194
00:10:28.080 --> 00:10:31.680
steadily diminished. In 1911, he married an Inuit woman named Navara.

195
00:10:31.780 --> 00:10:36.080
The couple went on to have two children together before she died in 1921 during

196
00:10:36.081 --> 00:10:38.950
the Spanish blue epidemic in 1912 Fren.

197
00:10:39.050 --> 00:10:42.790
And Rasmuson embarked on what became known as the first Thula expedition

198
00:10:42.791 --> 00:10:46.270
accompanied by two Greenlands the explorers intended to map some of the more

199
00:10:46.271 --> 00:10:50.150
obscure regions of the gigantic islands and to establish once and for all,

200
00:10:50.151 --> 00:10:54.470
whether the PII channel was real or art first named and described in 1892 by

201
00:10:54.630 --> 00:10:58.620
American Explorer, Robert Perry, the PII channel supposedly separated an island,

202
00:10:58.670 --> 00:11:02.340
which he creatively named Perry lands from the rest of Greenlands,

203
00:11:02.360 --> 00:11:05.860
but there was Delta over period's observations and more accurate maps were

204
00:11:05.861 --> 00:11:09.540
necessary for better and safer Arctic exploration. In fact,

205
00:11:09.541 --> 00:11:13.220
it was the search for the PI channel that caused the tragedy of the Denmark

206
00:11:13.221 --> 00:11:17.340
expedition that led to the death of my Erickson and his team. Therefore,

207
00:11:17.500 --> 00:11:21.970
Pete Toren might have felt a bit of justice when he proved Perry wrong following

208
00:11:21.971 --> 00:11:26.090
a five month voyage and Remus showed conclusively that the period channel did

209
00:11:26.091 --> 00:11:28.170
not exist. And the period land was in fact,

210
00:11:28.200 --> 00:11:30.650
just a peninsula at the Northern tip of Greenland.

211
00:11:30.790 --> 00:11:34.250
The first Dule expedition was hailed as one of the most daring and most

212
00:11:34.251 --> 00:11:37.130
successful POed journeys ever undertaken on dog sleds.

213
00:11:37.530 --> 00:11:41.080
It garnered enough attention that F Fren and Rasmuson returned to Denmark for a

214
00:11:41.240 --> 00:11:44.480
while to receive various accommodations and give multiple lectures.

215
00:11:44.600 --> 00:11:47.240
F Fren stayed for a few weeks, but eventually returned to Greenland,

216
00:11:47.290 --> 00:11:49.320
which he now considered is true home.

217
00:11:49.470 --> 00:11:52.400
Rasmussin organized a few more expeditions over the following years,

218
00:11:52.700 --> 00:11:56.760
but Fren did not participate in all of them as he was more concerned with

219
00:11:56.761 --> 00:11:57.680
raising a family.

220
00:11:57.910 --> 00:12:02.200
Plus with world war I taking place on the global stage supplies from Denmark

221
00:12:02.201 --> 00:12:04.480
became scarce. Even if the country was neutral,

222
00:12:04.510 --> 00:12:08.120
therefore Fren had to make sure that his home was kept properly stocked,

223
00:12:08.121 --> 00:12:10.400
which meant less time to go off on Arctic adventures.

224
00:12:10.680 --> 00:12:14.150
And he said there were a few events during these years that kept things

225
00:12:14.430 --> 00:12:18.590
interesting in 1918 foren took his wife and kids to Copenhagen for the first

226
00:12:18.591 --> 00:12:21.310
time. So they could see the big city. The following year.

227
00:12:21.370 --> 00:12:23.870
He served as a technical advisor on a Danish film.

228
00:12:23.890 --> 00:12:27.510
His first brush with the movie industry before Hollywood would come calling a

229
00:12:27.511 --> 00:12:29.550
decade later. Lastly, in 1921,

230
00:12:29.750 --> 00:12:32.950
it was one of the guests of honor when king Christ and visited Greenlands

231
00:12:33.020 --> 00:12:35.620
celebrate the 200th anniversary of Danish missionary,

232
00:12:35.820 --> 00:12:37.940
Hans ADIs first landing on the island,

233
00:12:43.280 --> 00:12:44.113
As we mentioned,

234
00:12:44.820 --> 00:12:49.060
90 21 was also the year that Frick's wife Navara died from the Spanish flu after

235
00:12:49.220 --> 00:12:52.220
a burial F fr sought something to take his mind off the grief.

236
00:12:52.240 --> 00:12:56.610
So he joined dress moose in on his fifth and most ambitious th Le expedition.

237
00:12:56.680 --> 00:12:59.970
This one did not seek to explore and map new lands though,

238
00:13:00.230 --> 00:13:04.130
but rather to study the Inuit people themselves and try to determine the origins

239
00:13:04.131 --> 00:13:05.890
of their culture and their language for this.

240
00:13:05.891 --> 00:13:09.210
The team traveled into the Canadian Arctic to meet with many Inuit groups who

241
00:13:09.211 --> 00:13:12.250
lived in these remote regions and try to make note of their customs.

242
00:13:12.520 --> 00:13:16.000
This was definitely the most of the sole expeditions.

243
00:13:16.050 --> 00:13:19.800
There was an archeologist on the trip and an ethnographer fr handled the

244
00:13:20.440 --> 00:13:23.800
cartography and collection of biological specimens while S muon was in charge of

245
00:13:23.801 --> 00:13:27.480
collecting information about the intellectual and spiritual culture of the

246
00:13:27.481 --> 00:13:28.880
Inuits. After three years,

247
00:13:28.980 --> 00:13:31.880
the bench result was a 10 volume work written by Rasmussin,

248
00:13:31.881 --> 00:13:35.510
which was at the time, the most detailed account ever on, on the Inuit people.

249
00:13:35.990 --> 00:13:37.190
Although the trip was successful,

250
00:13:37.370 --> 00:13:40.230
it did prove particularly challenging for Peter Fren.

251
00:13:40.231 --> 00:13:44.310
Thanks mainly to his near death experience. The led to the infamous poop story.

252
00:13:44.490 --> 00:13:47.870
It all happens when Fren got separated from his group in a snowstorm,

253
00:13:47.890 --> 00:13:50.550
he took refuge and a Tavas and fell asleep,

254
00:13:50.650 --> 00:13:54.830
but he woke up to find that it had been snowed in his tools were on his sled.

255
00:13:54.831 --> 00:13:58.100
So we tried digging out with his bare hands, but this didn't work.

256
00:13:58.120 --> 00:14:01.700
So we relied on the only resource he had available, but well,

257
00:14:02.020 --> 00:14:03.180
we'll let him describe the events.

258
00:14:03.340 --> 00:14:06.900
I had often seen dogs D in the sled track and had noticed that it would freeze

259
00:14:07.100 --> 00:14:10.500
as solid as a rock would not be cold. He the same effect on human discharge,

260
00:14:10.770 --> 00:14:14.460
repulsive as the thought was, I decided to try the experiments.

261
00:14:14.780 --> 00:14:19.010
I moved my bowel from the ex. I managed to fashion a chisel like instruments,

262
00:14:19.011 --> 00:14:21.650
which I left to freeze this time I was patient.

263
00:14:21.930 --> 00:14:26.010
I did not want to risk breaking my new tool by using it too soon while I waited

264
00:14:26.011 --> 00:14:30.010
the whole air made, filled up with fresh snow. It was soft and easy to remove,

265
00:14:30.070 --> 00:14:33.890
but I had to pull it down into my grave, which was slowly filling up at last.

266
00:14:33.970 --> 00:14:37.120
I decided to chisel my way and it worked very J and very slowly,

267
00:14:37.121 --> 00:14:38.480
I worked at the hole. As I dug.

268
00:14:38.680 --> 00:14:42.920
I could feel the blood trickling down my face from the scars where the beard had

269
00:14:42.921 --> 00:14:46.400
been torn away. This story has often been retold by others, but the question is,

270
00:14:46.820 --> 00:14:50.240
is it true? Well, that's hard to say since nobody else has tried to repeat it,

271
00:14:50.241 --> 00:14:54.080
but a team of anthropologists from Kent state university did come very close.

272
00:14:54.081 --> 00:14:57.240
When they tried to make a usable knife out of frozen human feces,

273
00:14:57.241 --> 00:14:58.041
their experiment,

274
00:14:58.041 --> 00:15:01.160
which was published in the journal of archeological science was not specifically

275
00:15:01.161 --> 00:15:03.280
trying to prove or disprove Franken's account,

276
00:15:03.580 --> 00:15:05.280
but rather they were putting to the test,

277
00:15:05.440 --> 00:15:09.160
an old Inuit story about a man who made a knife this way to skin and butcher a

278
00:15:09.180 --> 00:15:11.430
dog. They took into accounts in multiple variables,

279
00:15:11.431 --> 00:15:12.590
such as temperature and diet,

280
00:15:12.690 --> 00:15:16.030
but concluded that it was not possible under any circumstances. However,

281
00:15:16.180 --> 00:15:18.230
it's important to note that they tried to make a knife,

282
00:15:18.231 --> 00:15:21.310
whereas fr claim to have fashioned a chisel like tool.

283
00:15:21.360 --> 00:15:24.190
There are a few differences between the two chief among them.

284
00:15:24.191 --> 00:15:27.790
The fact that the chisel is much thicker and sturdier than a knife blade.

285
00:15:27.810 --> 00:15:31.700
So fr story does remain plausible. A thing that it happened.

286
00:15:31.880 --> 00:15:35.540
It still took a heavy toll on fr by the time he escaped the KVA,

287
00:15:35.600 --> 00:15:37.220
his left leg was frozen solid,

288
00:15:37.320 --> 00:15:40.100
and the Explorer had to crawl for hours before he made it back to camp.

289
00:15:40.330 --> 00:15:44.060
Gang green had set in and the flesh began to strip away from the foot until you

290
00:15:44.061 --> 00:15:45.940
could see bone using an Inuit treatments.

291
00:15:45.960 --> 00:15:48.940
One of Frens companions managed to stop the gang green from spreading,

292
00:15:48.941 --> 00:15:52.770
but the toes were beyond salvation one day for he even got sick of seeing his

293
00:15:52.890 --> 00:15:53.770
skeleton extremity.

294
00:15:53.771 --> 00:15:57.650
So he removed them with a pair of pencils and a hammer expecting what he

295
00:15:57.651 --> 00:16:01.090
described as an excruciating pain that cut into every nerve of his body.

296
00:16:01.110 --> 00:16:01.771
At the very least,

297
00:16:01.771 --> 00:16:05.770
this allowed him to put a boot on and hobble around instead of being bedridden.

298
00:16:05.771 --> 00:16:09.330
Ultimately the damage done to his left leg proved too great and broken,

299
00:16:09.650 --> 00:16:14.080
had to have the whole foot amputated. His days of Arctic exploration were over

300
00:16:19.460 --> 00:16:23.920
The fifth tole expedition ended in 1924. And Peter Frauen returned to Denmark.

301
00:16:23.921 --> 00:16:24.960
Once again, that same year,

302
00:16:24.961 --> 00:16:29.200
he got married to the second time to a woman named Magdalene van loon,

303
00:16:29.380 --> 00:16:32.480
who came from a rich family that made its money in margarine,

304
00:16:32.550 --> 00:16:36.030
whether he liked it or not frequently to transition to a life outside the

305
00:16:36.031 --> 00:16:38.310
Arctic, he resumed writing for the Politicon again.

306
00:16:38.370 --> 00:16:41.870
And his new brother-in-law made him the editor of a magazine called at home and

307
00:16:41.871 --> 00:16:45.510
abroad. He started a career as a writer where he found considerable success.

308
00:16:45.990 --> 00:16:48.150
Frick wrote over 30 novels and memoirs in his lifetime.

309
00:16:48.180 --> 00:16:52.030
Then he pared his writing fame into a movie career specializing as a consultant

310
00:16:52.230 --> 00:16:55.980
and technical advisor earth Arctic related projects. During the 1930s,

311
00:16:56.380 --> 00:16:59.660
Fren worked for MGM studios and split his time between Denmark and America.

312
00:16:59.800 --> 00:17:03.580
His biggest success in Hollywood was the 1933 Oscar winning movie Eskimo.

313
00:17:03.580 --> 00:17:05.100
It was based on tour Frens books.

314
00:17:05.160 --> 00:17:08.980
So he received writing credits and he was also featured in the film in the role

315
00:17:09.160 --> 00:17:12.780
of captain during the promotional tour of Eskimo Fren experience.

316
00:17:12.781 --> 00:17:15.410
For the first time, the new threat that was sweeping Europe,

317
00:17:15.630 --> 00:17:17.370
the rise of Adolf Hitler himself,

318
00:17:17.371 --> 00:17:21.330
part Jewish fro began helping refugees and dissidents who came to Denmark to

319
00:17:21.331 --> 00:17:22.410
escape the Nazi regime.

320
00:17:22.850 --> 00:17:26.250
Although this became increasingly harder as the country had its fair share of

321
00:17:26.251 --> 00:17:30.170
political and military figures who were Nazi sympathizers when world Wari broke

322
00:17:30.171 --> 00:17:30.450
out,

323
00:17:30.450 --> 00:17:34.010
Denmark became at first a protectorate than an occupied territory of Germany.

324
00:17:34.720 --> 00:17:36.840
FRN became involved with Danish resistance,

325
00:17:37.120 --> 00:17:39.640
although he couldn't fight directly at that point since he was in his mid

326
00:17:39.641 --> 00:17:41.720
fifties and only had one leg even.

327
00:17:41.780 --> 00:17:45.120
So he kept helping refugees and took part in sabotage missions.

328
00:17:45.121 --> 00:17:48.160
He got arrested twice by the gustapo and was beaten and tortured.

329
00:17:48.160 --> 00:17:49.160
After the second arrest,

330
00:17:49.680 --> 00:17:52.480
FRN was sent to a labor camp where he would've undoubtedly been executed.

331
00:17:52.481 --> 00:17:54.720
If he did not escape in time. According to him,

332
00:17:54.721 --> 00:17:58.520
almost everyone was found guilty when their trials came around and were

333
00:17:58.521 --> 00:17:59.354
sentenced to death.

334
00:17:59.470 --> 00:18:03.360
Even those who were not were still killed by being released outside the camp and

335
00:18:03.361 --> 00:18:05.160
then shot while resisting arrest.

336
00:18:05.460 --> 00:18:08.990
But F Frens friends managed to orchestrate his escape before this time and KA

337
00:18:09.250 --> 00:18:11.390
and he made it safely to Sweden. When the war ended,

338
00:18:11.480 --> 00:18:15.030
Peter FRN made a permanent move to the United States. He divorced his wife,

339
00:18:15.031 --> 00:18:18.950
which was merely a formality as the two had been separated for years during his

340
00:18:18.951 --> 00:18:22.270
time with the underground resistance later that same year F FRN married his

341
00:18:22.271 --> 00:18:25.470
third and final wife, a fashion illustrator named dag MarkOne.

342
00:18:25.690 --> 00:18:28.750
His wife began getting back to normal. He resumed his work with MDM.

343
00:18:28.910 --> 00:18:31.620
Steve EOC went on lecture tours. He wrote more books.

344
00:18:31.760 --> 00:18:33.780
He did some work for the United nations,

345
00:18:33.800 --> 00:18:36.260
but his adventuring days were mostly behind him. At this point.

346
00:18:36.860 --> 00:18:38.820
FN had one last brush with fame in 1956,

347
00:18:38.821 --> 00:18:42.060
when he appeared on the American quiz show, the $64,000 question,

348
00:18:42.240 --> 00:18:45.580
he won the big prize, answering questions on the topic of the seven seas.

349
00:18:45.670 --> 00:18:48.580
Peter F Crogan died of a heart attack. The following year on September,

350
00:18:48.581 --> 00:18:50.650
the second, 1957, age 71,

351
00:18:50.790 --> 00:18:55.210
he was then cremated and his ashes were spread around sole as a place which had

352
00:18:55.211 --> 00:18:59.090
shaped and defined the Explorer's legacy more so than any other.

353
00:19:00.990 --> 00:19:02.970
