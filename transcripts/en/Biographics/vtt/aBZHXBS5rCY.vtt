In thes of presidential,

7
00:00:20.510 --> 00:00:24.510
there are certain names that come etched in gold, Abraham Lincoln,

8
00:00:24.650 --> 00:00:25.510
George Washington,

9
00:00:25.990 --> 00:00:30.230
Franklin D Roosevelt names that will forever be remembered as the pinnacles of

10
00:00:30.430 --> 00:00:34.110
American leadership. But then you have the other end of the scale,

11
00:00:34.210 --> 00:00:38.710
the names that aren't so much etched in precious metals as hastily scrolled in a

12
00:00:38.740 --> 00:00:43.580
mixture of dog fixes and liquid shame names like James Buchana or Andrew Johnson

13
00:00:43.870 --> 00:00:47.420
names like Warren G Harding, a business friendly, Playboy,

14
00:00:47.421 --> 00:00:49.940
more interested in girls and booze than running the nation.

15
00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:54.540
Harding has the distinction of presiding over the most corrupt white house in us

16
00:00:54.541 --> 00:00:57.420
history. As the twenties roar is Ohio gang lines,

17
00:00:57.430 --> 00:01:02.050
their pockets fleeing the nation and partook in the teapot scandal,

18
00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:03.490
a swindle. So great.

19
00:01:03.550 --> 00:01:07.730
It was declared the most D depend piece of thi known to ours,

20
00:01:07.870 --> 00:01:12.530
but was there more to this party president than meets the eye?

21
00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:17.650
Despite his abysmal reputation Harding died so beloved that its thought 9

22
00:01:17.650 --> 00:01:21.210
million people lined as Coffin's route to pay their respects. Today,

23
00:01:21.211 --> 00:01:24.640
we're investigating how the 29th president got his cricket reputation.

24
00:01:25.220 --> 00:01:27.920
And if it's one he really deserves

25
00:01:34.230 --> 00:01:35.840
When as a presidential candidate,

26
00:01:35.841 --> 00:01:38.680
the wealthy Warren G Harding wanted to connect with common people.

27
00:01:38.980 --> 00:01:42.790
It would be to his childhood. He turned again and again,

28
00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:45.230
born shortly after the civil war ended on November.

29
00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:49.990
The second 1865 Harding's early life was a rural fairy tale.

30
00:01:50.330 --> 00:01:53.270
His parents were Ohio farmers turned country doctors,

31
00:01:53.410 --> 00:01:55.990
and Harding's boyhood was spent swimming in creeks,

32
00:01:55.991 --> 00:02:00.150
working with animals and playing in the local village bands educated in a one

33
00:02:00.350 --> 00:02:00.970
room schoolhouse.

34
00:02:00.970 --> 00:02:05.020
<v 1>He knew everybody in his area and they knew him by his teenage years.</v>

35
00:02:05.080 --> 00:02:09.220
He was so tall and athletic. Everyone referred to him as Adonis in shorts.

36
00:02:09.320 --> 00:02:11.060
It was an idyllic childhood.

37
00:02:11.520 --> 00:02:14.340
One hit later play on to boost his popularity.

38
00:02:14.480 --> 00:02:18.020
But had you told locals at the time that this easygoing Ohio lad would one day

39
00:02:18.021 --> 00:02:21.340
be presidents that probably have laughed in your face?

40
00:02:21.560 --> 00:02:25.970
That's because young wary Harding was almost singularly unambitious after

41
00:02:25.980 --> 00:02:28.610
graduating from Ohio central college in 1882,

42
00:02:28.611 --> 00:02:32.370
the future 29th president didn't go diving straight into politics.

43
00:02:32.590 --> 00:02:36.290
<v 0>No, instead did some teaching, tried his hand sales,</v>

44
00:02:36.291 --> 00:02:39.970
thought about getting into law and took some odd writing jobs.

45
00:02:40.110 --> 00:02:45.000
It was only through sheer dumb lucks that he ever landed on a solid career.

46
00:02:45.140 --> 00:02:49.320
In 1884, the four page weekly Marion star was on the brink of collapse.

47
00:02:49.350 --> 00:02:52.600
Reasoning. It might be fun to run a newspaper Harding in two friends,

48
00:02:52.700 --> 00:02:54.400
raised $300 and bought it out.

49
00:02:54.430 --> 00:02:57.960
They then set about transforming it into one of the kindest papers in a high Oak

50
00:02:58.070 --> 00:03:02.040
easygoing as a child Harding by now had grown into a man. So genie,

51
00:03:02.100 --> 00:03:03.680
he probably would shampoo your.

52
00:03:04.260 --> 00:03:07.040
If he thought it would make you like him under his watch,

53
00:03:07.140 --> 00:03:11.160
the stars coverage became instinctively deferential to Republicans and Democrats

54
00:03:11.170 --> 00:03:12.003
alike.

55
00:03:12.120 --> 00:03:15.840
Harding refused to publish bad stories unless absolutely necessary and became

56
00:03:15.841 --> 00:03:18.200
famous for never firing a single employee.

57
00:03:18.620 --> 00:03:22.990
This made the star go down super well with the highs political elite and Harding

58
00:03:23.270 --> 00:03:24.750
soon won himself some powerful friends,

59
00:03:24.970 --> 00:03:28.230
but it would be thanks to one woman that the star really took off.

60
00:03:28.330 --> 00:03:32.030
The Florence Mabel cling. The Wolf was divorced five years Harding, senior,

61
00:03:32.370 --> 00:03:34.190
and with a son from a previous marriage,

62
00:03:34.370 --> 00:03:38.430
she was also relatively wealthy and absolutely convinced the handsome well liked

63
00:03:38.431 --> 00:03:41.820
Harding could be a great man. In fact, she was so sure of this,

64
00:03:41.821 --> 00:03:46.420
that she pursued him relentlessly until Harding finally caved in 1891.

65
00:03:46.480 --> 00:03:47.700
The pair married that year,

66
00:03:48.260 --> 00:03:51.660
although it was touch and go convinced by a local rumor that Harding had hidden

67
00:03:51.790 --> 00:03:54.580
black ancestry Florence's father threatened to shoot him.

68
00:03:54.840 --> 00:03:56.300
If he touched her really though,

69
00:03:56.301 --> 00:03:59.100
Harding's new father-in-law should have been less worried about his racial

70
00:03:59.530 --> 00:04:01.610
grounds. And it's more about his champion.

71
00:04:02.490 --> 00:04:04.650
Philandering Harding was firmly of the,

72
00:04:04.651 --> 00:04:08.450
if it has a pulse sits worth a shot school of seduction and art,

73
00:04:08.690 --> 00:04:12.090
he carried into his marriage without batting an eyelid as his own father

74
00:04:12.450 --> 00:04:15.530
declared. If you were a girl, Warren, you'd be in the family way all the time.

75
00:04:16.270 --> 00:04:21.240
You can't say no, but while dad was talking about Harding's horndog tendencies,

76
00:04:21.260 --> 00:04:25.320
it was also a pretty good description of his soul friends, family, girls, wives,

77
00:04:25.321 --> 00:04:27.240
rivals, no matter who it was asking things of him,

78
00:04:27.241 --> 00:04:30.880
Harding was almost constitutionally incapable of saying no,

79
00:04:31.060 --> 00:04:35.000
it was a tendency that would one day land him in a teapot full of very hot

80
00:04:35.001 --> 00:04:39.040
water, but that would all come later. By the end of the 1890s,

81
00:04:39.041 --> 00:04:42.750
Florence's money had turns the Mar star into hits and the gen Harding into a

82
00:04:42.751 --> 00:04:46.470
respected businessman with strong connections to Ohio's Republican party.

83
00:04:46.471 --> 00:04:49.910
There was only one logical next step to take.

84
00:04:50.230 --> 00:04:52.350
It was time to get into politics.

85
00:04:58.330 --> 00:05:02.660
If you ever needed living proof of the old dress for the job you want,

86
00:05:02.800 --> 00:05:06.420
not for the job, you have look no further than Warren Harding,

87
00:05:06.421 --> 00:05:08.220
despite his lack of leadership qualities,

88
00:05:08.250 --> 00:05:12.860
Harding at an impressive knack for looking like someone who should be in charge

89
00:05:13.170 --> 00:05:13.570
tall,

90
00:05:13.570 --> 00:05:17.500
well dressed and with eyebrows that deserve their own biographics Harding was

91
00:05:17.501 --> 00:05:20.620
the epitome of what voters thought a politician should look like.

92
00:05:20.800 --> 00:05:24.370
So when fly pushed him into running for the Ohio centers in 1899,

93
00:05:24.371 --> 00:05:27.370
the OCOM was almost inevitable in his two terms and brief stint.

94
00:05:27.410 --> 00:05:30.810
As Lieutenant governor Harding managed to build a solid reputation in his home

95
00:05:30.811 --> 00:05:32.090
state. He was good at making friends,

96
00:05:32.270 --> 00:05:36.210
rarely made enemies and knew who to secret favors for and returned for

97
00:05:36.211 --> 00:05:39.490
advancements. By the time he stepped down to return to the newspaper business,

98
00:05:40.090 --> 00:05:42.840
Harding was a political force to be reckoned. Unfortunately,

99
00:05:43.060 --> 00:05:47.800
all that good will would very nearly be sabotaged by his best friend. Jerry,

100
00:05:48.130 --> 00:05:52.160
Jerry, you see is what Harding used to call his penis.

101
00:05:52.580 --> 00:05:54.000
And by God,

102
00:05:54.460 --> 00:05:57.760
did Harding have trouble controlling Jerry in 1905?

103
00:05:58.000 --> 00:05:59.920
Jerry made the acquaintance of Carrie Phillips,

104
00:05:59.940 --> 00:06:02.080
the wife of one of Harding's best friends.

105
00:06:02.250 --> 00:06:04.080
While that friend was in a Sanitarium,

106
00:06:04.081 --> 00:06:07.440
recovering from a brutal bout of depression, Harding, seduced Phillips,

107
00:06:07.441 --> 00:06:10.080
thus beginning an affair that would last 15, long years,

108
00:06:10.460 --> 00:06:14.560
all of which Harding recorded and cringy love letters with sentences like iHeart

109
00:06:14.830 --> 00:06:16.360
with insatiated longing.

110
00:06:16.440 --> 00:06:20.430
And until I feel that there will never be any relief until I take a long,

111
00:06:20.580 --> 00:06:24.950
deep wild draft on your lips and then bury my face on your pillow

112
00:06:25.260 --> 00:06:27.110
breasts. No to all our female viewers,

113
00:06:27.111 --> 00:06:31.990
if your breasts start pillaring consulted doctor far as the affair was for

114
00:06:32.270 --> 00:06:37.220
Jerry, it was also supremely foolish affairs can still sink political of

115
00:06:37.221 --> 00:06:41.140
careers. Now back in Harding's era, they could have you metaphorically,

116
00:06:41.280 --> 00:06:45.820
tar and feathered and run outta politics on the railroad Harding himself seems

117
00:06:45.821 --> 00:06:47.860
to have recognized this in 1913,

118
00:06:47.861 --> 00:06:50.620
he wrote to Philips strongly hinting that he might like to leave his wife and

119
00:06:50.780 --> 00:06:53.580
marry her instead making their sex Capades legit.

120
00:06:53.880 --> 00:06:56.300
The timing wasn't coincidental by now,

121
00:06:56.301 --> 00:07:00.570
Harding was a rising dark had introduced William Howard Taft on stage after his

122
00:07:01.370 --> 00:07:05.170
renomination in 1912, earning booze from the pro Roosevelt faction.

123
00:07:05.270 --> 00:07:06.930
He was planning a run for the Senate.

124
00:07:07.270 --> 00:07:11.090
So this was the perfect moment to neutralize a possible scandal by marrying

125
00:07:11.091 --> 00:07:12.250
Phillips. Sadly,

126
00:07:12.251 --> 00:07:15.610
the plan didn't exactly work out Phillips responded by saying that you'd rather

127
00:07:15.611 --> 00:07:17.850
start seeing other men breaking Hardings heart,

128
00:07:18.300 --> 00:07:21.160
but even if she had agreed to become his wife, it's unlikely,

129
00:07:21.640 --> 00:07:24.360
Jerry would've gone along with it in 1914,

130
00:07:24.361 --> 00:07:28.200
while in the middle of his Senate campaign Harding met a teenage girl named Nan

131
00:07:28.400 --> 00:07:29.960
Britain who developed a crush on him.

132
00:07:29.980 --> 00:07:32.280
It was the start of yet another multi-year affair.

133
00:07:32.340 --> 00:07:34.320
One that would coincide with his rise.

134
00:07:34.321 --> 00:07:38.280
The very top Harding one is Senate seat in 1914 with such a crushing margin.

135
00:07:38.281 --> 00:07:42.030
The he immediately began being talked about as a future presidential candidate.

136
00:07:42.031 --> 00:07:45.950
Again, this had little to do with his actual political skills during his time in

137
00:07:46.110 --> 00:07:46.180
Congress,

138
00:07:46.180 --> 00:07:50.470
Harding missed more than two thirds of all votes preferring playing poker and

139
00:07:50.471 --> 00:07:52.470
making friends of the dull growing of law.

140
00:07:52.670 --> 00:07:55.910
Making still rally voting meant rare making enemies come.

141
00:07:56.150 --> 00:08:00.300
1916 Harding was chairman of the Republican national venture and making its

142
00:08:00.301 --> 00:08:03.540
keynote speech. He seemed unstoppable. It was at this point,

143
00:08:04.020 --> 00:08:06.420
the the time bomb had set himself years earlier,

144
00:08:06.810 --> 00:08:10.620
finally exploded as Woodrow Wilson's presidency entered its second term.

145
00:08:11.020 --> 00:08:13.580
Carrie Phillips wrote to Harding with a simple request.

146
00:08:13.640 --> 00:08:17.740
Either he start paying her big money or she would tell the whole world about

147
00:08:17.741 --> 00:08:18.940
what Jerry had been up to.

148
00:08:25.350 --> 00:08:28.850
As dangerous as news of affair might be the Hardings career.

149
00:08:28.950 --> 00:08:32.450
It was who it had the affair with that really threatened to take him down.

150
00:08:33.050 --> 00:08:37.370
Carrie Phillips was a hardcore Mani file fully paid up Kaiser

151
00:08:37.720 --> 00:08:40.520
fangirl. When war broke out in Europe in 14,

152
00:08:40.580 --> 00:08:43.440
she became a vocal backer of the central powers using her influence,

153
00:08:43.840 --> 00:08:45.240
try and get Harding to sign with Germany.

154
00:08:45.510 --> 00:08:48.520
This was bad enough when the us was officially neutral,

155
00:08:48.580 --> 00:08:51.920
but after Washington declared war on Berlin in April, 1917,

156
00:08:52.300 --> 00:08:55.600
it made their affair as politically toxic as weapons,

157
00:08:56.120 --> 00:08:59.880
grade plutonium terrified of the possible fallout from this political to noble

158
00:09:00.480 --> 00:09:03.640
Harding arranged to pay Phillips $5,000 a year in harsh money.

159
00:09:03.750 --> 00:09:04.920
When she demanded more,

160
00:09:04.980 --> 00:09:08.680
he turned to the Republican national committee for help in exchange for silence.

161
00:09:08.681 --> 00:09:13.280
Phillips was BU in another $20,000 and was given all expenses paid trip to Japan

162
00:09:13.460 --> 00:09:13.900
in all,

163
00:09:13.900 --> 00:09:18.750
its that keeping Harding's a fair secret cost around $300,000 in today's

164
00:09:18.751 --> 00:09:21.750
money. That's just his affair with Phillips in 1919,

165
00:09:21.950 --> 00:09:25.470
the now 20 something Nan Britain secretly gave birth to Harding's love Charles,

166
00:09:25.570 --> 00:09:29.030
the Senate quickly arranged yet another round of monthly payments to cover up

167
00:09:29.031 --> 00:09:31.910
Jerry's escapades. The two women finally paid off Harding.

168
00:09:31.911 --> 00:09:34.110
Good at last turn his attention to what he wanted.

169
00:09:34.111 --> 00:09:37.940
Most of all to run for presidents, actually that's not quite true.

170
00:09:38.130 --> 00:09:41.820
More accurate rendering might be that Harding's friends desperately wanted him

171
00:09:41.821 --> 00:09:45.980
to run for presidents while the gen Harding was simply happy to go along for the

172
00:09:45.981 --> 00:09:46.320
ride.

173
00:09:46.320 --> 00:09:51.220
The long shot bid was dreamed up by the rich a Harry Doherty who loved telling

174
00:09:51.240 --> 00:09:52.300
anyone who'd listened.

175
00:09:52.301 --> 00:09:57.010
That Harding would win because he looks like a P Doughty knew

176
00:09:57.570 --> 00:10:00.970
that was more to it than that. The Republican field was crowded that year.

177
00:10:01.130 --> 00:10:04.810
And so crowded that the convention would clearly have to nominate a compromise

178
00:10:04.811 --> 00:10:05.644
candidate.

179
00:10:05.700 --> 00:10:09.050
Dowty stroke of genius was to position Harding as the ultimate compromise,

180
00:10:09.330 --> 00:10:11.130
a friendly Senator who knew all the party,

181
00:10:11.131 --> 00:10:15.610
big wigs from poker games and hadn't made a political's life. It was a plan.

182
00:10:15.970 --> 00:10:20.120
The, it would hand Harding the presidency at the 1920 Republican convention in

183
00:10:20.121 --> 00:10:22.760
Chicago, the party deadlocked on the 10th ballot.

184
00:10:22.790 --> 00:10:24.920
According to legend the go's elites,

185
00:10:24.921 --> 00:10:28.440
then retired to a smoky backroom at the Blackstone hotel where they agreed to

186
00:10:28.441 --> 00:10:30.240
make the in offensive hearting their man.

187
00:10:30.300 --> 00:10:35.160
And that's how a one term Senator from Ohio landed at the top of the G P ticket

188
00:10:35.270 --> 00:10:37.910
with Calvin cool, his running mate for Harding.

189
00:10:37.930 --> 00:10:41.470
It was the best possible time to be leading his party's white house bit by now,

190
00:10:41.990 --> 00:10:45.990
Roy Wilson was badly ill and his progressive agenda deeply unpopular. In fact,

191
00:10:45.991 --> 00:10:50.630
the whole progressive era was starting to be perceived as a needless exhausting

192
00:10:50.631 --> 00:10:53.590
expansion of government rather than put forward a vision for America.

193
00:10:53.610 --> 00:10:56.670
All Harding had to do was say what his presidency wouldn't be like.

194
00:10:56.770 --> 00:11:00.980
It wouldn't be anything like Wilson's under the slogan returned to normalcy

195
00:11:01.090 --> 00:11:01.820
Harding,

196
00:11:01.820 --> 00:11:06.460
campaigned for an ill defined cliche return to some non-existent golden pass

197
00:11:06.650 --> 00:11:09.980
that even he couldn't articulate. Not that it mattered.

198
00:11:10.040 --> 00:11:14.900
It turns out that Blands cliches was exactly what America wanted to hear on

199
00:11:15.100 --> 00:11:19.610
election day Harding and cool crushed it at the outbox winning what was then the

200
00:11:19.611 --> 00:11:22.410
biggest landslide since the unopposed election of 1820,

201
00:11:22.590 --> 00:11:26.410
not only did Harding take 60% of the popular vote and sweep the electoral

202
00:11:26.411 --> 00:11:26.870
college.

203
00:11:26.870 --> 00:11:30.730
He even took Tennessee becoming the first Republican since reconstruction to win

204
00:11:30.890 --> 00:11:34.330
a former Confederate state inaugurated on March the fourth 90 21,

205
00:11:34.331 --> 00:11:37.890
Warren G Harding became presidents at the head of the Republican party that

206
00:11:38.080 --> 00:11:40.960
commanded huge majorities in both chambers of Congress.

207
00:11:41.260 --> 00:11:44.480
He could also reshape the country, however he saw fit yet.

208
00:11:44.480 --> 00:11:48.720
It would soon transpire that reshaping America is exactly what Harding didn't

209
00:11:48.721 --> 00:11:51.400
want to do. Even as he stood before the roaring crowds,

210
00:11:51.401 --> 00:11:54.640
the new president knew in his bones that he wasn't up for the job.

211
00:11:55.020 --> 00:11:58.200
I'm not hit for this office and should never have been here later.

212
00:11:58.340 --> 00:11:59.173
Say in private,

213
00:11:59.300 --> 00:12:03.320
not even Warren Harding could have realized just how right his withering

214
00:12:03.321 --> 00:12:05.120
assessment would turn out to be.

215
00:12:05.500 --> 00:12:09.120
Now we'll get back to presidential politics of days gone by in just a moment.

216
00:12:09.220 --> 00:12:12.320

244
00:13:35.780 --> 00:13:37.550
When most presidents enter the oval office,

245
00:13:37.660 --> 00:13:42.190
they come carrying big plans for a visionary agenda, not Warren Harding.

246
00:13:42.191 --> 00:13:45.710
The 29th president came to power with big plans to spend his time fishing

247
00:13:45.860 --> 00:13:48.470
golfing and playing poker. As Harding himself once said,

248
00:13:48.730 --> 00:13:52.190
I'm a man of limited talents. I don't think I'm big enough that the presidency,

249
00:13:52.320 --> 00:13:56.540
those talents he did have mostly seemed to involve being sleazy while

250
00:13:56.541 --> 00:13:59.860
president's Harding was notorious for sneaking NA Britain into the white house

251
00:13:59.861 --> 00:14:02.260
and having sex with Aaron in a closet right next to the oval office.

252
00:14:02.320 --> 00:14:06.060
He also liked to drink expensive liquor in a time when prohibition was the lore

253
00:14:06.061 --> 00:14:10.180
of the land. Yet, despite all this, he wasn't entirely useless today.

254
00:14:10.181 --> 00:14:12.460
There's a small, but growing number of history busts,

255
00:14:12.461 --> 00:14:17.250
he'll tell you that Harding did some worthwhile in even great things during

256
00:14:17.310 --> 00:14:19.850
his turn. So before we get into all the scandals,

257
00:14:19.851 --> 00:14:21.410
let's take a quick look at the other side,

258
00:14:21.730 --> 00:14:23.930
but the things the 29th president got, right,

259
00:14:23.960 --> 00:14:28.010
perhaps the biggest of all was race relations at a time when the KU Klux Klan

260
00:14:28.110 --> 00:14:32.370
was resurgence and race relations were less in the gut than drowning at the

261
00:14:32.371 --> 00:14:36.010
bottom of a very deep well, Harding became an unlikely champion of Toler.

262
00:14:36.340 --> 00:14:37.720
In October of 1921,

263
00:14:37.721 --> 00:14:40.960
he stood before a racially segregated audience in Birmingham, Alabama,

264
00:14:41.020 --> 00:14:45.560
and gave a blistering speech calling for economic quality between white and

265
00:14:45.561 --> 00:14:47.680
black people. Whether you like it or not,

266
00:14:47.820 --> 00:14:52.640
he funded unless our democracy is a lie. You must stand for that equality.

267
00:14:52.830 --> 00:14:53.540
That same year,

268
00:14:53.540 --> 00:14:57.320
he expended a ton of political capital supporting the D bill and ultimately

269
00:14:57.380 --> 00:15:00.360
failed, but pioneering effort to make lynching a federal crime.

270
00:15:00.500 --> 00:15:04.440
Yet it wasn't just on racial issues that Harding went hardcore for equality.

271
00:15:04.660 --> 00:15:05.720
In his short time in office,

272
00:15:05.780 --> 00:15:09.920
he commuted the sentences of 24 political prisoners locked up during world war.

273
00:15:10.040 --> 00:15:12.950
I by Uson administration created the veterans bureau,

274
00:15:13.250 --> 00:15:16.950
the 4runner of the department of veterans affairs and passed a short-lived bill

275
00:15:16.951 --> 00:15:19.790
that funded new healthcare clinics for children and pregnant women.

276
00:15:19.820 --> 00:15:23.670
That last one by the way, was responsible for a 9% drop in infant mortality.

277
00:15:23.930 --> 00:15:26.030
In the years that it was active in stuff like this,

278
00:15:26.031 --> 00:15:29.590
you can almost see the great president Warren Harding might have become for all

279
00:15:29.750 --> 00:15:31.980
his faults for all his as deep down.

280
00:15:32.080 --> 00:15:35.940
He really did seem to want nothing more than to make everyone happy. Sure.

281
00:15:35.941 --> 00:15:38.220
That often took the form of letting friends push him around,

282
00:15:38.240 --> 00:15:40.660
but it also meant a desire to support minorities,

283
00:15:40.760 --> 00:15:44.980
former soldiers and poor mothers that went well beyond what the era expected of

284
00:15:44.981 --> 00:15:45.860
him. It was Harding.

285
00:15:45.980 --> 00:15:49.540
You helped to push the then mighty steel industry for an eight hour Workday

286
00:15:49.541 --> 00:15:50.140
Harding.

287
00:15:50.140 --> 00:15:55.010
That past laws that led to a ands budget unthinkable in the Wilson era had had

288
00:15:55.011 --> 00:15:56.330
just had more energy.

289
00:15:56.470 --> 00:16:00.690
Had he spent less time playing poker and more time using his office to force

290
00:16:00.691 --> 00:16:02.170
through staff like the D bill.

291
00:16:02.390 --> 00:16:05.850
It probably today be remembered as a champion of America's underdogs.

292
00:16:06.100 --> 00:16:09.410
Sadly though, that energy was something Harding, simply lacked.

293
00:16:09.480 --> 00:16:13.080
This was something he himself recognized, combat his own deficiency.

294
00:16:13.320 --> 00:16:17.080
He brought in outside help to do all of the heavy lifting and as best this

295
00:16:17.081 --> 00:16:20.880
policy resulted in guys like Charles G do and Herbert Hoover running their

296
00:16:20.881 --> 00:16:23.880
departments like well old machines at his worst. Well,

297
00:16:24.140 --> 00:16:28.600
things got seriously bad as we're about to see it was the outside help that

298
00:16:28.601 --> 00:16:32.360
would soon suck Warren Harding's reputation into one of the biggest political,

299
00:16:32.670 --> 00:16:33.630
a bars in history.

300
00:16:39.730 --> 00:16:42.790
If you're into Googling long dead presidents and let's face it since you're

301
00:16:42.830 --> 00:16:44.790
watching this video, you probably are.

302
00:16:45.050 --> 00:16:48.910
You might have stumbled across this Harding quote before I have no trouble with

303
00:16:48.911 --> 00:16:53.380
my enemies, I can take care of my enemies. All right. But my friends,

304
00:16:53.610 --> 00:16:56.460
they're the ones who keep me walking the floor nights.

305
00:16:56.630 --> 00:17:00.740
Those friends were a bunch of SL bags, Harding, mostly new from his Ohio days,

306
00:17:01.180 --> 00:17:03.500
known to history as the Ohio gang, they were so corrupt.

307
00:17:03.501 --> 00:17:06.180
They could have given the mob a run for its money.

308
00:17:06.360 --> 00:17:08.500
One notorious member was Harry Doughty.

309
00:17:08.501 --> 00:17:11.380
The businessman who helped Harding win the Republican nomination.

310
00:17:11.520 --> 00:17:12.353
Now attorney general,

311
00:17:12.360 --> 00:17:15.850
he developed a racket in to frauding the government misappropriating property

312
00:17:15.851 --> 00:17:20.490
confiscated during world war I and selling it to liners own pockets on a whole

313
00:17:20.491 --> 00:17:24.050
other level was the corruption of Charles R.

314
00:17:24.050 --> 00:17:26.210
Forbes despite being part of the Ohio gang Forbes.

315
00:17:26.210 --> 00:17:29.970
Wasn't actually from the Buckeye state. No, he was just a friend of Hardings.

316
00:17:30.050 --> 00:17:33.570
A friend's Harding made director of his newly created veterans bureau only for,

317
00:17:33.930 --> 00:17:36.960
for OB step, not just embezzle money, earmarked to veterans,

318
00:17:36.961 --> 00:17:41.480
but also steal drugs and medicinal alcohol from hospitals and sell them on to

319
00:17:41.481 --> 00:17:45.200
bootleggers and Forbes wasn't even the worst as a whole, a hire gang.

320
00:17:45.360 --> 00:17:48.120
We responsible for theft, bribery, extortion, securities fraud,

321
00:17:48.121 --> 00:17:50.520
witness tampering, black male, racketeering, perjury,

322
00:17:50.860 --> 00:17:54.800
and many other crimes that are just too numerous to list their best.

323
00:17:55.030 --> 00:17:58.320
They were like a black hole at the center of government devouring,

324
00:17:58.321 --> 00:17:59.920
public funds at their worst.

325
00:18:00.150 --> 00:18:03.040
They were actively involved in stuff like smuggling.

326
00:18:03.160 --> 00:18:06.160
Craziest part Harding was aware of all of it. Now,

327
00:18:06.161 --> 00:18:07.920
maybe he didn't know the specifics,

328
00:18:07.921 --> 00:18:12.550
but he knew for sure that his little gang was up to no good. It was just,

329
00:18:12.570 --> 00:18:14.470
he enjoyed their company too much.

330
00:18:14.570 --> 00:18:19.550
He valued their friendship too much to even suggest that they try reigning in

331
00:18:19.551 --> 00:18:22.350
their behavior. As his father had noted all those years ago,

332
00:18:22.540 --> 00:18:24.950
Harding just couldn't say no to anyone.

333
00:18:25.730 --> 00:18:29.500
Not even Albert full a paid up sticker fan for the oil industry.

334
00:18:29.501 --> 00:18:33.820
Senator full was also a bribe taking machine.

335
00:18:34.160 --> 00:18:37.700
It would be false actions more than those of any others that would soon her

336
00:18:37.701 --> 00:18:40.140
Warren Harding's reputation into a dumpster.

337
00:18:40.520 --> 00:18:45.140
And it would be all thanks to a little out crop of rock in Wyoming that

338
00:18:45.141 --> 00:18:47.500
resembled a teapot back in 1909.

339
00:18:47.501 --> 00:18:52.130
The Navy had requested certain oil as we put aside for possible emergency use

340
00:18:52.260 --> 00:18:56.330
among these reserves was the Wyoming site known as teapot dome.

341
00:18:56.331 --> 00:18:59.330
But while this was good planning on the Navy's part for the rich oilman,

342
00:18:59.331 --> 00:19:00.610
it felt like a slap in the face.

343
00:19:00.830 --> 00:19:03.450
Why were these reservoirs of black gold going untapped,

344
00:19:03.451 --> 00:19:07.570
especially when they could make those who extracted them silly money.

345
00:19:07.670 --> 00:19:11.440
It was a line of thinking Albert four was sympathetic to so sympathetic when

346
00:19:11.441 --> 00:19:13.120
Harding made him secretary of the interior,

347
00:19:13.420 --> 00:19:16.240
he orbit openly winked at the or Barrons and said,

348
00:19:16.850 --> 00:19:21.360
watch this in 1921 for last Harding to put the reserves under his department.

349
00:19:21.620 --> 00:19:23.880
The moment Harding had signed off on the idea.

350
00:19:24.440 --> 00:19:27.040
Fall was drawing up secret agreements with oil industry,

351
00:19:27.380 --> 00:19:32.230
CHS Harry Sinclair and Edward Doy in return for chance tot these sites,

352
00:19:32.790 --> 00:19:36.510
Sinclair and Donny would merely have to fulfill minor obligations to the

353
00:19:36.511 --> 00:19:40.030
government provided Albert fall and possibly Warren Harding were paid well,

354
00:19:40.140 --> 00:19:44.990
nothing would stand between these caricature capitalists and SCRM

355
00:19:45.350 --> 00:19:48.510
duck levels of wealth. It was the beginning of the teapot dome scandal,

356
00:19:48.710 --> 00:19:52.100
a PR disaster that would soon become the greatest example of presidential

357
00:19:52.101 --> 00:19:52.850
misconduct.

358
00:19:52.850 --> 00:19:56.460
This side of Watergate was also the scandal that would turn Warren Harding's

359
00:19:56.461 --> 00:19:57.780
name into mud.

360
00:20:04.040 --> 00:20:07.980
The expose that would send teapot dome boiling over came barely a year into

361
00:20:07.981 --> 00:20:11.180
Harding's presidency on April the 14th, 1920 to the wall street journal.

362
00:20:11.630 --> 00:20:13.570
The news of the corrupt deal the very next day,

363
00:20:13.571 --> 00:20:16.810
Wyoming Senator John Kendrick began a formal investigation by then.

364
00:20:16.811 --> 00:20:19.210
The corruption was already outta control. For example,

365
00:20:19.211 --> 00:20:22.010
there was the other all man Colonel James G Darden,

366
00:20:22.030 --> 00:20:25.290
who decided he'd been stiffed of the chance to tap teapot.

367
00:20:25.770 --> 00:20:29.090
Derman began drilling regardless this first Harding to send the Marines,

368
00:20:29.091 --> 00:20:32.520
to stop Amon for Denver post reporters to document the entire incidents,

369
00:20:32.521 --> 00:20:35.680
to buy their silence full arranged a million dollar bribe for the editors.

370
00:20:36.040 --> 00:20:39.720
Then that was Albert for himself in return for teapot dome for was given a

371
00:20:39.721 --> 00:20:44.280
hundred thousand dollars loan by the oil Barron Don to build himself a fancy

372
00:20:44.530 --> 00:20:49.360
ranch dropped off in bags by Don SunEd while the other arm man Sinclair

373
00:20:49.361 --> 00:20:52.120
arranged the cent $300,000 in Liberty bonds. Now,

374
00:20:52.121 --> 00:20:55.880
perhaps the more pressing question is, was Harding in on the corruption.

375
00:20:56.020 --> 00:20:59.680
The conventional view is that Harding was less corrupt than he was surrounded by

376
00:20:59.700 --> 00:21:00.600
crooks still.

377
00:21:00.620 --> 00:21:04.800
He certainly had an idea of what four was up to and may have even profited for

378
00:21:04.801 --> 00:21:05.060
it.

379
00:21:05.060 --> 00:21:09.870
In 1923 Harding's newspaper attracted a huge offer and a deal that may have been

380
00:21:09.871 --> 00:21:12.870
a way of giving Harding his cut of the teapot shaped pie.

381
00:21:13.000 --> 00:21:16.310
There was also the luxury expenses paid crews around the world.

382
00:21:16.311 --> 00:21:19.670
Sinclair offered to the presidents despite this whatever note for sure if

383
00:21:19.671 --> 00:21:21.790
Harding was in on it in the summer of 1923,

384
00:21:21.791 --> 00:21:25.230
just as the teapot dome investigation was heating up Harding and dishonour arch

385
00:21:25.370 --> 00:21:28.300
set off on a tour of the west and states at Alaska,

386
00:21:28.520 --> 00:21:30.900
it was built as a chance for Harding to reconnect with voters,

387
00:21:31.120 --> 00:21:34.420
but other things were clearly weigh on his mind on the boat to Alaska,

388
00:21:34.660 --> 00:21:36.860
a troubled looking Harding, took his secretary of commerce,

389
00:21:37.260 --> 00:21:41.020
her Hoover to one side and asked him if you knew of a great scandal in our

390
00:21:41.021 --> 00:21:41.790
administration,

391
00:21:41.790 --> 00:21:45.820
would you for the good of the country and the party expose it publicly?

392
00:21:46.500 --> 00:21:49.250
Or would you bury it? Uber was all for telling the truth,

393
00:21:49.350 --> 00:21:53.210
but Harding would never get the chance. As the Barty returned from Alaska,

394
00:21:53.350 --> 00:21:56.370
the president came down with a mysterious illness thinking it was food

395
00:21:56.371 --> 00:21:59.690
poisoning. Doctors rushed Harding to San Francisco that on the 2nd of August,

396
00:22:00.010 --> 00:22:03.890
1923, he died of a suspected heart attack. While Florence was reading to him,

397
00:22:04.270 --> 00:22:05.130
he was 57.

398
00:22:05.550 --> 00:22:10.080
The death of warranty hearting hit the nation like an lytic asteroid with just

399
00:22:10.081 --> 00:22:11.280
over half of his first term,

400
00:22:11.520 --> 00:22:14.480
complete Harding was still in the honeymoon stage of his presidency.

401
00:22:14.481 --> 00:22:17.800
When his body was returned to Washington on board, a slow moving train,

402
00:22:17.801 --> 00:22:21.560
it's estimated over 9 million people lined the route to pay their respects.

403
00:22:21.620 --> 00:22:22.800
It was an outpouring of grief,

404
00:22:23.180 --> 00:22:26.840
shared moments of love for a president cruelly snatched before his time.

405
00:22:27.020 --> 00:22:30.550
It was also just about the last time anywhere would ever feel anything but utter

406
00:22:30.950 --> 00:22:32.830
contempt for Warren Harding,

407
00:22:32.900 --> 00:22:36.270
shocked by the stories of Leighs emerging about his former boss, new president,

408
00:22:36.271 --> 00:22:39.990
Calvin goig appointed two special prosecutors to look into teapot dome.

409
00:22:40.310 --> 00:22:43.190
Although the investigation would drag on into Herbert who's presidency,

410
00:22:43.210 --> 00:22:45.230
it eventually uncovered a scandal. So great.

411
00:22:45.490 --> 00:22:48.270
It annihilated Harding's reputation in 1929.

412
00:22:48.470 --> 00:22:51.860
Now before wound becoming the first former cabinet secretary to be jailed for a

413
00:22:51.861 --> 00:22:55.020
crime committed while in office Ohio gang member, Charles R.

414
00:22:55.020 --> 00:22:56.540
Forbes was likewise convicted of defrauding.

415
00:22:56.541 --> 00:23:00.180
The government while Harry Dowty was forced to leave Washington in disgrace,

416
00:23:00.290 --> 00:23:04.740
even the crooked Orman fed badly Bernie's son had died in a murder suicide link

417
00:23:04.741 --> 00:23:08.300
to teapot dome while the reserves were taken back under federal control,

418
00:23:08.520 --> 00:23:12.650
it wasn't until two and 15 that the site was at last sold for drilling this time

419
00:23:13.070 --> 00:23:13.970
in a legal manner.

420
00:23:14.270 --> 00:23:18.290
But what of Warren G Harding himself at the moment he died most would've

421
00:23:18.450 --> 00:23:21.570
probably expected Harding to go down as a mid rank president,

422
00:23:21.571 --> 00:23:25.770
someone who was popular, but didn't live long enough to get much done today,

423
00:23:25.771 --> 00:23:28.250
though, with everything we know about teapot dome,

424
00:23:28.310 --> 00:23:31.440
the Ohio gang and love affairs and SLS,

425
00:23:31.441 --> 00:23:35.360
you'd be hard pressed to find anyone who'd put Harding's presidency anywhere,

426
00:23:35.780 --> 00:23:37.640
but the very bottom, in some ways,

427
00:23:37.641 --> 00:23:40.160
perhaps this is unfair rule is faults Harding.

428
00:23:40.180 --> 00:23:43.400
Didn't send the nation spiraling towards civil war or get impeached,

429
00:23:43.401 --> 00:23:47.160
or even have the misfortune like Herbert Hoover to preside over an economic

430
00:23:47.161 --> 00:23:47.900
crisis.

431
00:23:47.900 --> 00:23:52.080
He simply lacked the vision to get anything done while also relying too much on

432
00:23:52.081 --> 00:23:54.160
friends who are willing to take advantage.

433
00:23:54.540 --> 00:23:58.920
It said that the presidency brings out the true character of a man that it shows

434
00:23:58.921 --> 00:24:02.320
people for, who they really are in Warren Harding's case.

435
00:24:02.321 --> 00:24:05.310
It simply showed the world how deeply ocre was,

436
00:24:05.370 --> 00:24:09.630
how far had been promoted above his talents, perhaps in the ends.

437
00:24:09.631 --> 00:24:13.470
The one thing Harding should have said no to was the presidency itself.

438
00:24:14.730 --> 00:24:16.750
