00:00:06.100 --> 00:00:11.040
You can check them out through the link below which historical figure Springs to

4
00:00:11.041 --> 00:00:12.160
mind. When you hear the words,

5
00:00:12.500 --> 00:00:17.240
the last king of the French we're guess it's probably Louie the 16th,

6
00:00:17.380 --> 00:00:20.360
the long head far who lost his head in the French revolution.

7
00:00:20.730 --> 00:00:24.550
But what if we told you that the story of Francis Kings didn't ends with the

8
00:00:25.030 --> 00:00:28.470
guillotine slicing through Louis's neck in 1793?

9
00:00:28.471 --> 00:00:33.390
What if we told you that France didn't say goodbye to its last king until

10
00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:35.790
over 50 years later? Well,

11
00:00:36.140 --> 00:00:40.150
it's time you met that king Louis Felipe was a man whose life turned on

12
00:00:40.151 --> 00:00:42.620
revolution, born into an aristocratic family.

13
00:00:42.640 --> 00:00:46.180
<v 1>He survived the first French revolution that killed his father only to become</v>

14
00:00:46.181 --> 00:00:50.780
king in yet another revolution that toed his father's cousin as a figurehead of

15
00:00:50.781 --> 00:00:51.660
the July monarchy,

16
00:00:51.661 --> 00:00:55.940
he survived rebellions and Napoleonic cos before losing everything.

17
00:00:56.220 --> 00:01:00.420
When the streets of Paris, once more rose up this time against him,

18
00:01:00.700 --> 00:01:02.730
a lifelong liberal who became a dictator king,

19
00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:07.050
an exile who grew up to rule the nation that exalt him. This is the complex,

20
00:01:07.440 --> 00:01:11.970
fascinating life story of Louie Felipe. The last king of the French.

21
00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:26.040
<v 0>In the early hours of October, the sixth,</v>

22
00:01:26.480 --> 00:01:31.200
1789 fate handed the teenage Louis Felipe, a front row seat to history.

23
00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:32.240
The previous evening,

24
00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:37.240
a huge mob of women had gathered in Paris and set off for VAAI the opulence

25
00:01:37.241 --> 00:01:39.920
palace of king Louis, the 16th of Maria Antoinette.

26
00:01:40.060 --> 00:01:42.480
It was the early days of the French revolution,

27
00:01:42.930 --> 00:01:46.150
not three months before the Bastille had fallen. And now here,

28
00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:51.350
Louis Felipe was leaning out of a window on a cool October night as the women of

29
00:01:51.351 --> 00:01:55.390
Paris forcibly dragged the king and his family back to the capital,

30
00:01:55.910 --> 00:01:59.270
watching the procession of women passing below Louis Felipe had good reason to

31
00:01:59.271 --> 00:01:59.890
be scared.

32
00:01:59.890 --> 00:02:04.820
He was the eldest son of the duke de oar for cap king was his first cousin

33
00:02:04.850 --> 00:02:08.500
once removed, but 16 year old Louis Felipe, he wasn't scat.

34
00:02:08.680 --> 00:02:13.340
He was already planning to ride this wave of revolution to greatness born on

35
00:02:13.341 --> 00:02:15.060
October the sixth, 1773,

36
00:02:15.300 --> 00:02:18.660
Louis Fe Philipp had what you might describe as an unusual upbringing.

37
00:02:19.060 --> 00:02:22.980
His father, the duke to oar was obsessed with social experimentation.

38
00:02:22.981 --> 00:02:27.090
While of the Royal children were learning the basics of ruling Louis Felipe and

39
00:02:27.091 --> 00:02:31.610
his siblings were contemplating strenuous physical tasks while reciting Jean

40
00:02:31.890 --> 00:02:32.560
Jack Reau.

41
00:02:32.560 --> 00:02:36.170
This meant a childhood that left the boy in excellent physical and mental shape

42
00:02:36.190 --> 00:02:40.930
and the father with a reputation as a very UN Royal Royal, this reputation,

43
00:02:40.931 --> 00:02:44.720
it turned out to be useful when the French revolution hit while other

44
00:02:44.750 --> 00:02:46.360
aristocrats fled into exile,

45
00:02:46.361 --> 00:02:49.640
the duke was elected to the revolutionary national assembly,

46
00:02:50.120 --> 00:02:51.920
changing his name to Felipe Egal.

47
00:02:52.380 --> 00:02:56.280
So when teenage Louis Felipe witnessed the 1789 women's March from dark cold

48
00:02:56.281 --> 00:03:00.120
open, he didn't panic. Instead he joined the Jackon club.

49
00:03:00.140 --> 00:03:04.000
That's the same Jackon club Ross Pierre came from and he also enrolled in the

50
00:03:04.001 --> 00:03:07.400
French army. As France went to war with Austria in 1792,

51
00:03:07.600 --> 00:03:10.000
Louis Felipe found himself soaring up the ranks,

52
00:03:10.001 --> 00:03:13.720
eventually becoming attached to the staff of general Domar. At this stage,

53
00:03:13.820 --> 00:03:18.320
it might have seemed like the revolution was a godsend for the oar family in

54
00:03:18.440 --> 00:03:19.710
general area of 1793,

55
00:03:19.950 --> 00:03:22.670
either duke or Filippi gala or whatever you want to call him.

56
00:03:22.930 --> 00:03:27.590
He voted alongside the national assembly to execute his cousin Louis the 16th,

57
00:03:27.690 --> 00:03:29.390
but this was just the family's high points,

58
00:03:29.460 --> 00:03:31.750
like a roller coaster cart approaching the top of a peak.

59
00:03:32.010 --> 00:03:36.510
The only way for the only on clan now was down in April of

60
00:03:36.750 --> 00:03:37.470
1793,

61
00:03:37.470 --> 00:03:41.580
Louis Felipe discovered general Doerre was plotting a coup while he didn't join

62
00:03:41.581 --> 00:03:45.380
the plot. He also didn't report it, which became pretty awkward.

63
00:03:45.450 --> 00:03:49.340
<v 1>When the coup was uncovered as general DeRay and his fellow plots fled to</v>

64
00:03:49.341 --> 00:03:51.780
Austria, Louis Philipp was forced to flee alongside them.

65
00:03:51.781 --> 00:03:55.860
Suddenly the Allon name was synonymous with counter revolution back in Paris,

66
00:03:55.960 --> 00:04:00.570
the committee of public safety arrested the entire fan that November

67
00:04:00.830 --> 00:04:03.450
Felipe Egal was guillotined Louis.

68
00:04:03.850 --> 00:04:06.650
<v 0>Felipe was hiding in Switzerland when he got the news that his father was dead</v>

69
00:04:06.870 --> 00:04:10.130
and that he now was the duke of oar for the rest of his life.

70
00:04:10.131 --> 00:04:12.490
He would blame himself for his father's death.

71
00:04:12.630 --> 00:04:16.170
The next few years were a turbulent time in Europe while Louis Felipe traveled

72
00:04:16.171 --> 00:04:18.210
the consonants under an assumed name in France,

73
00:04:18.270 --> 00:04:22.280
the Therma Orian reaction end did the reign of terror and sent Roberts Pierre to

74
00:04:22.281 --> 00:04:25.040
the guillotine in the place of the revolutionary governments.

75
00:04:25.220 --> 00:04:26.680
The directory rose up.

76
00:04:26.740 --> 00:04:31.560
It was their agents who finally tracked Louis Felipe Denmark in 1796.

77
00:04:31.780 --> 00:04:35.240
The directory wasn't as vicious as Roberts Pierre's goon squad. However,

78
00:04:35.590 --> 00:04:40.000
they did not want an O running around Europe, especially now EXR Orian,

79
00:04:40.360 --> 00:04:43.030
who are plotting to put the new duke on the French throne.

80
00:04:43.550 --> 00:04:46.110
So they decided to make Louis Philipp an offer. He couldn't refuse

81
00:04:47.690 --> 00:04:50.950
get out of Europe and we won't guillotine the rest of your family.

82
00:04:51.330 --> 00:04:53.470
And that was how the future French king Louis Philipp.

83
00:04:53.690 --> 00:04:55.270
He wounds up going to America,

84
00:05:01.570 --> 00:05:03.580
Despite the directories fears, Louis Philipp,

85
00:05:03.680 --> 00:05:07.460
he wasn't much of a threat when all the honest started plotting to overthrow the

86
00:05:07.461 --> 00:05:08.980
directory and make him king.

87
00:05:09.240 --> 00:05:13.220
The new duke was super clear that he wanted nothing to do with this hair brain

88
00:05:13.221 --> 00:05:15.500
scheme. That may be why in 1800,

89
00:05:15.600 --> 00:05:18.700
he was finally able to make peace with the comp OI.

90
00:05:18.960 --> 00:05:21.340
The com was the younger brother of Louis the 16th,

91
00:05:21.500 --> 00:05:24.410
the hit fled into Exar with his older brother, Louie the 18th,

92
00:05:24.580 --> 00:05:26.330
right after the revolution exploded.

93
00:05:26.470 --> 00:05:29.890
And he was now living in England when Louisie Philipp joins the comps.

94
00:05:29.891 --> 00:05:31.170
After a couple of years in America,

95
00:05:31.430 --> 00:05:34.650
the comps had every reason to hate the only on name.

96
00:05:35.050 --> 00:05:38.090
Remember the last two had voted for his brother's execution,

97
00:05:38.390 --> 00:05:39.450
the comps living brother,

98
00:05:39.970 --> 00:05:44.480
Louie the 18th was even convinced that entire revolution had been an only honest

99
00:05:44.710 --> 00:05:46.320
plot, but this was 1800.

100
00:05:46.500 --> 00:05:50.000
The directory had now fallen with the situation in France, in flux.

101
00:05:50.001 --> 00:05:53.320
The compt was determines that the Royal family rebuild their bridges.

102
00:05:53.580 --> 00:05:57.040
So despite Louis the 18th being all like, well, uh, dude, no,

103
00:05:57.500 --> 00:06:00.200
the comp invited Louise Philipp back into the fold.

104
00:06:00.920 --> 00:06:03.400
Not that this reconciliation had much real world effect.

105
00:06:03.620 --> 00:06:06.760
By the time the family made up Napoleon bona apart was firmly in control of

106
00:06:06.761 --> 00:06:09.800
France. And no one was clamoring for a Royal return.

107
00:06:09.910 --> 00:06:13.600
That was pretty much it for the next decade while Napoleon did his thing,

108
00:06:13.601 --> 00:06:17.070
conquering everything in sight, Louise, Felipe potted around owns London,

109
00:06:17.160 --> 00:06:21.790
doing whatever it is that Kings do in exile before he moved to Sicily to marry

110
00:06:22.150 --> 00:06:25.070
Marie Antoinette's niece. And really his story,

111
00:06:25.510 --> 00:06:28.230
it kind of could have ended there where it not for

112
00:06:28.590 --> 00:06:30.710
18, 12, 18,

113
00:06:30.710 --> 00:06:35.150
12 is the year that Napoleon made the classic dictator mistake of invading

114
00:06:35.151 --> 00:06:39.300
Russia as is army ends, empire disintegrated around him.

115
00:06:39.300 --> 00:06:43.100
It began to look like Napoleon. Wouldn't be leading France for very much longer.

116
00:06:43.600 --> 00:06:47.420
All of this, it raised a potent question who would,

117
00:06:48.160 --> 00:06:50.940
as the allies marched into Paris in April of 1814,

118
00:06:50.941 --> 00:06:55.300
it wasn't clear who would get the restored French throne while Louie the 18th

119
00:06:55.320 --> 00:06:57.850
was the obvious choice. There was a of all,

120
00:06:58.050 --> 00:07:02.210
all honest movements in parts of French society that wanted duke to be king.

121
00:07:02.590 --> 00:07:06.090
It didn't tell that Louis Fe Philipp kept quiet, right until the last second,

122
00:07:06.120 --> 00:07:08.730
when he finally declared for Louis the 18th,

123
00:07:08.840 --> 00:07:13.330
something that the duke was controlled into this by the comp more likely though,

124
00:07:13.350 --> 00:07:16.930
the allies had a bit of a quiet word with him. Something like, uh, dude,

125
00:07:17.110 --> 00:07:21.320
we do not need you screwing up our post Napoleon plans by starting a civil war.

126
00:07:21.460 --> 00:07:23.960
<v 1>Yo, anyway, Louis Felipe's late support for Louis.</v>

127
00:07:24.020 --> 00:07:29.000
The 18th definitely was not wholehearted during the hundred days when

128
00:07:29.001 --> 00:07:32.800
Napoleon escaped El and returned to France, Louis Felipe lurked around Paris,

129
00:07:32.910 --> 00:07:36.720
looking for all the world, like someone waiting to snatch the throne.

130
00:07:36.750 --> 00:07:40.150
<v 0>When Napoleon inevitably again, after Waterloo and Louis,</v>

131
00:07:40.151 --> 00:07:42.430
the 18th was restored for the second time.

132
00:07:42.910 --> 00:07:47.510
Louis Felipe began lavishing gifts and patronage upon liberals looking for all

133
00:07:47.511 --> 00:07:47.900
the world,

134
00:07:47.900 --> 00:07:52.710
like someone trying to fashion himself as an attractive alternative king.

135
00:07:53.170 --> 00:07:57.070
But the clearest indication we have about the Duke's ambitions came in September

136
00:07:57.071 --> 00:07:58.950
of 1820. Earlier that year,

137
00:07:59.160 --> 00:08:02.980
the comp art surviving son had been assassinated with his death.

138
00:08:03.220 --> 00:08:06.140
Louis Felipe had become third in line to the throne,

139
00:08:06.480 --> 00:08:09.940
but then it sounds out that the dead man had impregnated his wife before dying

140
00:08:10.070 --> 00:08:14.580
seven months later, she gave birth to that child on re and just like that.

141
00:08:15.180 --> 00:08:17.900
Louis Felipe was out of the running for king.

142
00:08:18.120 --> 00:08:21.410
The news of the miracle baby gave Louis Felipe a breakdown.

143
00:08:21.650 --> 00:08:25.850
He reportedly collapsed when the news reached him wa length that all would now

144
00:08:25.851 --> 00:08:29.930
never amount to anything. It was a touch melodramatic and it was also untrue.

145
00:08:29.931 --> 00:08:32.130
Nobody at that time had any way of knowing it.

146
00:08:32.150 --> 00:08:36.530
But Louis Felipe was just one good revolution away from becoming king

147
00:08:43.100 --> 00:08:47.160
On September the 16th, 1824 Louisie the 18th passed away in his place.

148
00:08:47.161 --> 00:08:51.120
The com to OI assumed the French thrown under the name Charles the 10th.

149
00:08:51.720 --> 00:08:55.000
But this time Louis Felipe had more or less given up on being king becoming

150
00:08:55.040 --> 00:08:59.600
instead a big player on the business scene and of friends of the OI liberals in

151
00:08:59.601 --> 00:09:00.560
the government's opposition.

152
00:09:00.750 --> 00:09:05.640
Thus the duke who is perfectly placed to see just how quickly France sour on

153
00:09:05.641 --> 00:09:09.000
Charles, the 10th back when Louis the 18th, that center in 1814,

154
00:09:09.120 --> 00:09:12.840
a bunch of people in France had basically been like, whoa, whoa, whoa, uh,

155
00:09:13.270 --> 00:09:15.630
time out right now. I want another corrupt Louis.

156
00:09:15.880 --> 00:09:19.590
Luing over us with absolute power. That is not cool. Right?

157
00:09:19.810 --> 00:09:23.470
So Louis the 18th had signed something called the charter of 1814,

158
00:09:23.700 --> 00:09:28.190
semi that basically said the king shall not act like a gigantic.

159
00:09:29.710 --> 00:09:31.190
Although Louis had thought the charter and outrage,

160
00:09:31.470 --> 00:09:34.630
he stood by it out of necessity, realizing that chimes have changed,

161
00:09:35.200 --> 00:09:36.860
but Charles, he didn't get the message.

162
00:09:37.080 --> 00:09:40.820
Almost the first thing he did after being coronated was to figuratively bend

163
00:09:40.850 --> 00:09:45.580
over and use the charter to wipe his bottom under Charles' ministry,

164
00:09:45.581 --> 00:09:46.400
freedom of speech.

165
00:09:46.400 --> 00:09:50.180
It was acts capital punishment for religious offenses was revived and the

166
00:09:50.181 --> 00:09:54.820
franchise was restricted into not even the wealthy Bourge war could vote by 1830

167
00:09:54.821 --> 00:09:55.654
Charles.

168
00:09:55.710 --> 00:10:00.170
So close to being a dictator that his advisors actually advised that he launched

169
00:10:00.290 --> 00:10:04.370
a Royal coup. So he did on Sunday, July the 25th,

170
00:10:04.570 --> 00:10:08.170
1830 Charles published something known as the four ordinances.

171
00:10:08.520 --> 00:10:11.770
This outlawed his opposition, and also freedom of the press.

172
00:10:11.990 --> 00:10:14.050
His governments thought it was a master stroke.

173
00:10:14.150 --> 00:10:17.760
The people of Paris thought differently that Monday,

174
00:10:17.820 --> 00:10:21.000
the French capital trembled with unrest, there were protests,

175
00:10:21.320 --> 00:10:23.080
anti monarchy chance. The smashing of property.

176
00:10:23.420 --> 00:10:27.760
It might have died down of its own accord had Charles not sent in the army to

177
00:10:27.761 --> 00:10:30.200
shoot some of the protestors. As an example,

178
00:10:30.740 --> 00:10:34.680
it was as effective as suicide as if Charles had tied a rock to his neck and

179
00:10:34.690 --> 00:10:39.350
dived head first into the sand. The next day, July the 27th, 1830 Paris.

180
00:10:39.710 --> 00:10:41.470
It went up in flames across the Capitol.

181
00:10:42.110 --> 00:10:43.670
Rats built barricades and armed themselves.

182
00:10:43.860 --> 00:10:47.990
When the soldiers came storming in firefights erupted, there was carnage.

183
00:10:47.991 --> 00:10:51.030
There was blood in the streets, outmaneuvered by the angry Persians.

184
00:10:51.130 --> 00:10:54.230
The army simply had to abandon the city as they left.

185
00:10:54.330 --> 00:10:58.860
The last thing Charles soldiers saw was the wide flag of the monarchy being torn

186
00:10:58.861 --> 00:11:03.580
down and the revolutionary trick law hoisted in the air. And with that,

187
00:11:03.960 --> 00:11:07.740
the July revolution had begun. So where you might ask,

188
00:11:08.230 --> 00:11:09.980
where was Louis FA leap? Well,

189
00:11:10.360 --> 00:11:13.220
not anywhere really the future king was hold up at his a stage,

190
00:11:13.221 --> 00:11:14.700
trying his absolute best,

191
00:11:15.080 --> 00:11:18.890
not to look like someone waiting around to snatch the thrown after Charles was

192
00:11:19.490 --> 00:11:21.410
guillotines. It was his liberal opposition,

193
00:11:21.411 --> 00:11:25.090
friends in Paris who were doing all of the work as Paris fell to the writers,

194
00:11:25.350 --> 00:11:28.290
the upper OI businessman and opposition leaders, Louis Philipp,

195
00:11:28.530 --> 00:11:32.010
surrounded himself with got together and decided that they needed to do

196
00:11:32.011 --> 00:11:34.890
something. The July revolution had caught them all by surprise.

197
00:11:34.960 --> 00:11:39.480
They were glad the street fighters of Paris seemed to want Tyran Charles gone,

198
00:11:39.800 --> 00:11:40.760
but were equally terrified.

199
00:11:40.761 --> 00:11:44.320
The next logical step would be a Roberts Pierre revival group wheeling out the

200
00:11:44.321 --> 00:11:44.980
guillotine.

201
00:11:44.980 --> 00:11:49.480
So they hatched a plan to make sure that this time the duke de succeeded in his

202
00:11:49.481 --> 00:11:52.960
dreams of becoming king with most of the newspapers on their side,

203
00:11:53.040 --> 00:11:54.280
they printed out posters,

204
00:11:54.281 --> 00:11:58.920
declaring Paris was revolting and that the duke to oar was the last friend

205
00:11:59.340 --> 00:12:02.680
of the people. Then they dispatched Ansary to Louis Fe Phillips' day,

206
00:12:02.681 --> 00:12:07.080
who told him to get his to Paris and grab the opportunity that they just handed

207
00:12:07.140 --> 00:12:10.320
him. Louis Felipe arrived in Paris just before midnight on Friday,

208
00:12:10.430 --> 00:12:12.910
July the 30th, 1830 that's a evening.

209
00:12:12.911 --> 00:12:16.710
Charles the 10th fled his palace ahead of a Lynch mob just like that.

210
00:12:16.890 --> 00:12:20.150
The king was gone and the French throne was suddenly vacant.

211
00:12:20.690 --> 00:12:25.030
Now all Louis Felipe needed to do was convince the writers to let him take it.

212
00:12:25.330 --> 00:12:28.910
But before he get into all of that and believe me, it's all worth the wait.

213
00:12:29.230 --> 00:12:32.830
I didn't want to tell you about our fantastic sponsor. Vince, Sarah watches.

214
00:12:33.080 --> 00:12:37.780
I'm wearing a Viero right now. This one is a Viero chronograph,

215
00:12:37.960 --> 00:12:40.540
as well as keeping perfect time. It's also got a timer.

216
00:12:40.550 --> 00:12:43.580
These three back dials there. They don't just look great,

217
00:12:43.581 --> 00:12:45.260
but they also serve a function.

218
00:12:45.520 --> 00:12:49.220
Now I picked out a watch with a blue and silver combination, as you can see,

219
00:12:49.221 --> 00:12:51.740
but there are loads of options on their website.

220
00:12:51.870 --> 00:12:55.410
It'll be sure to find something that to your style and your wrist size,

221
00:12:55.440 --> 00:12:58.250
I've got small little wrists. So they've got smaller models.

222
00:12:58.310 --> 00:13:00.250
One of them fit me perfectly with summer coming up.

223
00:13:00.270 --> 00:13:03.330
I'd also recommend you check up. Then you chiro mesh series.

224
00:13:03.520 --> 00:13:05.010
They've got breathable straps.

225
00:13:05.011 --> 00:13:08.130
So there's no sweating into it and getting all uncomfortable.

226
00:13:08.350 --> 00:13:12.170
And these watches can also be dressed up or dressed down and fit with lots of

227
00:13:12.171 --> 00:13:16.560
different styles. Also all the one bands on Viera watches are interchangeable.

228
00:13:16.620 --> 00:13:19.840
So you can easily get a new look for your one. Watch.

229
00:13:20.060 --> 00:13:22.040
You can also buy those watch straps separately.

230
00:13:22.560 --> 00:13:25.440
Viera watches believe that luxury. Isn't about price or specification.

231
00:13:25.441 --> 00:13:28.520
It's about detail and craftsmanship and Viera watches.

232
00:13:28.550 --> 00:13:31.080
They've got a lot of that. Unlike many other watches on the market,

233
00:13:31.560 --> 00:13:34.120
Viera is not about minimalist style. It's more about the classic,

234
00:13:34.121 --> 00:13:35.270
good of a watch,

235
00:13:35.271 --> 00:13:39.230
which something I love further by selling direct to the consumer Viera can

236
00:13:39.231 --> 00:13:43.430

240
00:14:01.090 --> 00:14:03.140
Have you ever had one of those mornings where you wake up,

241
00:14:03.380 --> 00:14:06.740
remember what you did last night and then just immediately curl up into a ball

242
00:14:06.840 --> 00:14:11.060
and start screaming. Well, that was Louis Felipe's morning on July the 31st,

243
00:14:11.380 --> 00:14:11.930
1830.

244
00:14:11.930 --> 00:14:15.420
When he realized it just toped his cousin once removed and willingly rode into

245
00:14:15.421 --> 00:14:19.650
the middle of revolutionary Paris, Louis Felipe had a total meltdown.

246
00:14:19.790 --> 00:14:24.130
He actually begs all those liberals who'd dragged in there not to make him king,

247
00:14:24.131 --> 00:14:26.850
which must have seemed well, all sorts of ironic,

248
00:14:27.110 --> 00:14:28.730
but there was no way he could back out.

249
00:14:28.731 --> 00:14:33.210
Now the simple truth was that if someone didn't take this revolutionary bull by

250
00:14:33.211 --> 00:14:38.200
the horns, the July revolution, it wasn't stop with Charles and well,

251
00:14:38.480 --> 00:14:43.440
everyone present had all two real memories of the swish and funk sound of the

252
00:14:43.441 --> 00:14:47.240
guillotine. In the end, Louis Philipp, he agreed to clear up the mess,

253
00:14:47.430 --> 00:14:48.880
draping himself in the trickle law.

254
00:14:48.880 --> 00:14:53.640
He rode out into the raging streets of Paris. Now this was dangerous.

255
00:14:53.700 --> 00:14:56.840
No one in Paris had gone into this revolt because they desperately wanted to

256
00:14:56.841 --> 00:15:01.400
replace one Doy king with another Royal lados by riding out like that.

257
00:15:01.600 --> 00:15:05.480
Louis Philippe was putting himself at real risk of someone screaming that guy's

258
00:15:05.520 --> 00:15:07.360
a duke cut off his head.

259
00:15:07.700 --> 00:15:12.430
The reason that this didn't happen is largely thanks to the marque Del Lafa a

260
00:15:12.431 --> 00:15:16.390
legendary French hero who played a significant role in both the American and

261
00:15:16.750 --> 00:15:19.950
original French revolutions. The marque was respected by everyone,

262
00:15:20.180 --> 00:15:21.710
even prisms street fighters.

263
00:15:21.711 --> 00:15:24.990
When he met Louis Felipe outside the hotel to Villa and enthusiastically

264
00:15:24.991 --> 00:15:29.710
embraced him, it sent a clear signal to Paris. The revolution was over,

265
00:15:30.250 --> 00:15:32.380
not that Charles of the 10th that realized it though,

266
00:15:32.510 --> 00:15:35.460
still alive with his head attached to his body.

267
00:15:35.680 --> 00:15:39.500
The king was desperately scheming to get his family back onto the throne.

268
00:15:39.840 --> 00:15:43.860
The plan he hits on was almost ingenious. The people wanted a new king. Well,

269
00:15:44.050 --> 00:15:46.300
he'd give them one he'd abdicate for his grandson,

270
00:15:46.520 --> 00:15:48.460
the miracle baby we mentioned earlier,

271
00:15:48.900 --> 00:15:51.340
there was a cunning move that could have saved the B and line.

272
00:15:51.560 --> 00:15:55.010
Unfortunately for Charles though, the idea came too late.

273
00:15:55.230 --> 00:15:58.730
As Charles was AB advocating Paris was watching Louis Fe Philipp and the Marqui

274
00:15:59.050 --> 00:16:03.610
laugh, waving the trickle law from a balcony, signaling the Dawn of a new era.

275
00:16:04.030 --> 00:16:07.570
Any thoughts the people of Paris had of allowing another Boer take the throne.

276
00:16:07.950 --> 00:16:12.480
It died that very day on August, the ninth, 1830 Louis Felipe was crowns.

277
00:16:12.540 --> 00:16:15.960
It was agreed beforehand that he would take the title of king of the French

278
00:16:16.040 --> 00:16:19.560
implying a public servant who looked after his people rather than the

279
00:16:19.561 --> 00:16:23.320
traditional title of king of France, which implied a grumpy landlord,

280
00:16:23.330 --> 00:16:25.680
angry with all of these peasants stinking up the place.

281
00:16:25.980 --> 00:16:29.280
It was the moment Louis Felipe had been waiting for his entire life.

282
00:16:29.570 --> 00:16:31.000
41 years ago,

283
00:16:31.001 --> 00:16:34.990
the new king of the French had leaned out of a window and watched as Paris'

284
00:16:34.991 --> 00:16:39.470
women marched king Louisie the 16th back from Versai. Now here,

285
00:16:39.471 --> 00:16:43.390
he was wearing the crown. His long dead relative had lost to the guillotine.

286
00:16:43.530 --> 00:16:46.470
He wasn't just the survivor of two French revolutions.

287
00:16:46.850 --> 00:16:49.950
He was the beneficiary as Charles the 10th fled into Axel.

288
00:16:49.951 --> 00:16:51.350
The establishments of Louis Fe Philipps,

289
00:16:51.420 --> 00:16:56.300
July monarchy looked a a lot more like a new chapter in French role history.

290
00:16:56.301 --> 00:17:00.900
One that would establish a new and glorious dynasty in a way. This was right.

291
00:17:01.000 --> 00:17:05.300
It really was a new chapter for Francis monarchy, but it was also its last,

292
00:17:11.480 --> 00:17:16.450
The July monarchy was popular for baby 23 minutes before reality hit the

293
00:17:16.451 --> 00:17:19.770
problem was Louis Philipp had been put on the throne by a bunch of Bour

294
00:17:20.090 --> 00:17:23.250
liberals, but the people who'd done all the fighting and dying during that July

295
00:17:23.251 --> 00:17:23.651
revolution,

296
00:17:23.651 --> 00:17:27.570
they were workers and they wanted progress to show for all that blood.

297
00:17:27.770 --> 00:17:32.490
She Louis Fe Philipp failed to deliver on this spectacularly. Now sure.

298
00:17:32.491 --> 00:17:35.920
He wasn't anywhere near resort radical. As Charles more people could vote.

299
00:17:35.921 --> 00:17:39.360
Freedom of the press was guaranteed and the government had a healthy opposition.

300
00:17:39.460 --> 00:17:41.920
But if you were some unemployed, Persian street fighter,

301
00:17:42.230 --> 00:17:46.080
less autocratic than the last guy, wasn't exactly what you'd been fighting for.

302
00:17:46.300 --> 00:17:47.960
In the first few years of his existence,

303
00:17:47.961 --> 00:17:51.080
the July monarchy had to face down all manner of threats.

304
00:17:51.170 --> 00:17:54.560
There was a Bonna artist plot to topple Louis Fe Philipp and put one of

305
00:17:54.561 --> 00:17:56.280
Napoleon's relatives on the throne.

306
00:17:56.450 --> 00:18:00.400
There was also a legitimate uprising to topple Louis Fe Philipp and replace him

307
00:18:00.401 --> 00:18:04.280
with Charles's grandson. There was also the infamous June rebellion of 1832.

308
00:18:04.281 --> 00:18:08.320
The one li IAB is based upon this PR uprising left 800 people.

309
00:18:08.880 --> 00:18:09.750
Ironically though,

310
00:18:09.850 --> 00:18:14.470
all these attempted revolts actually shore up Louis Philipp's support faced with

311
00:18:14.471 --> 00:18:18.030
the prospect of a not great Monarch or the workers wheeling out the guillotine.

312
00:18:18.130 --> 00:18:20.310
The middle classes always chose the monarchy,

313
00:18:20.450 --> 00:18:22.590
but there was one man who saw in the July monarchy,

314
00:18:22.591 --> 00:18:25.910
not a bull work against terror, but a golden opportunity. Yep.

315
00:18:25.940 --> 00:18:30.220
It's time to welcome into this story. Uh, all friends, Napoleon III,

316
00:18:30.480 --> 00:18:33.340
if you'll no doubt recall, if you saw our previous video about him,

317
00:18:33.341 --> 00:18:36.660
Napoleon II was the Exel nephew of the original Napoleon.

318
00:18:36.920 --> 00:18:40.540
Now living under the insane delusion that he should be emperor of France.

319
00:18:40.920 --> 00:18:45.380
He was also a gigantic pain in Louis Felipe's dairy air in

320
00:18:45.460 --> 00:18:48.860
1836 when Louis Felipe was desperately trying to shore up support.

321
00:18:48.960 --> 00:18:53.250
Napole a third launched a tragically inept co in Strassburg that succeeded only

322
00:18:53.530 --> 00:18:54.530
in embarrassing everyone.

323
00:18:54.680 --> 00:18:58.570
When Louis Felipe tried to return Napoleon the first SAS to France in 1814,

324
00:18:58.571 --> 00:19:00.170
Napoleon the third was there again,

325
00:19:00.360 --> 00:19:04.690
soaking up the limelight by launching yet another co so incompetent that even

326
00:19:04.970 --> 00:19:06.970
anti Bonna apart felt sorry for him,

327
00:19:07.070 --> 00:19:10.680
unable to deal with the bad publicity executing a living to Napoleon.

328
00:19:10.681 --> 00:19:14.360
The first would bring Louis. Felipe simply had the wannabe emperor locked up,

329
00:19:14.500 --> 00:19:18.520
but he could afford to be lenient on crazy old Napoleon thei in 1840.

330
00:19:18.780 --> 00:19:21.880
By that point, the July monarchy, it was no longer really unpopular.

331
00:19:22.030 --> 00:19:25.640
This was more of an accident than any grand's plan on Louis Felipe's part

332
00:19:25.670 --> 00:19:27.680
between 1840 and 1846,

333
00:19:28.000 --> 00:19:31.910
France had experienced an economic boom that hoist up living standards and kept

334
00:19:31.911 --> 00:19:35.110
the middle classes happy. But even during these house, young days,

335
00:19:35.210 --> 00:19:36.150
the warning signs,

336
00:19:36.260 --> 00:19:39.110
they were there for the monarchies future Louis Philipp's most important

337
00:19:39.430 --> 00:19:40.710
minister was a guy called Fran.

338
00:19:41.630 --> 00:19:45.430
Gizo the conservative iron fist in the Kings soft liberal glove.

339
00:19:45.530 --> 00:19:49.470
As the economy boomed Gizo used precisely none of that money to support the

340
00:19:49.471 --> 00:19:50.304
lower classes,

341
00:19:50.560 --> 00:19:54.500
those and women who mans the barricades during the July revolution.

342
00:19:55.060 --> 00:19:58.940
Well they got squat. It wasn't just money. They didn't get,

343
00:19:59.260 --> 00:20:03.300
although one of the July monarchies resort Etro was to enlarge the franchise

344
00:20:03.301 --> 00:20:07.500
that had been so restricted under Charles voting was still only something that

345
00:20:07.600 --> 00:20:08.780
the 1% could do.

346
00:20:08.960 --> 00:20:12.570
The rest of the country was starting to wonder why they were voices were not

347
00:20:12.571 --> 00:20:16.970
being hurt. And that's where things were as 1846 rolled into view.

348
00:20:17.070 --> 00:20:19.170
The July monarchy was popular. Ish,

349
00:20:19.320 --> 00:20:24.090
just so long as the good times kept on rolling and no massive shark upset the

350
00:20:24.091 --> 00:20:28.210
precarious foundation of sands that Louis Felipe had built his Royal house on.

351
00:20:28.470 --> 00:20:29.570
But this is Louis.

352
00:20:29.890 --> 00:20:34.720
Felipe were talking about the king whose life and on revolutions little did the

353
00:20:34.721 --> 00:20:38.600
king of the French know, but he was fast approaching his final one

354
00:20:45.140 --> 00:20:47.080
On January the 29th, 1848,

355
00:20:47.480 --> 00:20:52.240
Alex de Tove got to his feet in the French chamber of deputies and made a

356
00:20:52.241 --> 00:20:56.160
prophetic speech. I'm told there is no danger because there are no riots.

357
00:20:56.400 --> 00:21:00.320
I am told that because there is no visible disorder on the surface of society.

358
00:21:00.490 --> 00:21:03.400
There is no revolution at hand. Gentlemen,

359
00:21:03.401 --> 00:21:06.200
permit me to say that I believe you are deceived.

360
00:21:06.620 --> 00:21:11.030
This is my profound conviction. I believe that we are at this moment,

361
00:21:11.390 --> 00:21:15.350
sleeping on April volcano. It was two years on from where we last left.

362
00:21:15.550 --> 00:21:18.430
Louis Felipe hoping the good times would never stop rolling.

363
00:21:18.850 --> 00:21:23.030
In fact that not stopped rolling. The entire cart had fallen to pieces.

364
00:21:23.670 --> 00:21:26.710
1846 had seen a major recession hit France.

365
00:21:26.870 --> 00:21:29.220
There are millions out of work at the same time,

366
00:21:29.340 --> 00:21:33.340
a great famine had swept Europe making life so painful that the decade became

367
00:21:33.341 --> 00:21:34.900
known as the hungry forties.

368
00:21:35.530 --> 00:21:38.660
This was the volcano that taco Ville was talking about.

369
00:21:38.940 --> 00:21:40.860
A France boiling with invisible rage,

370
00:21:40.861 --> 00:21:44.740
hidden by a restrictive franchise that locked most people out of power.

371
00:21:45.010 --> 00:21:48.370
Only the discontent. It wasn't entirely invisible.

372
00:21:48.470 --> 00:21:52.370
The previous year opposition deputies had begun organizing banquets across

373
00:21:52.371 --> 00:21:56.570
France in order to air their grievances under the July monarchy protest was

374
00:21:56.571 --> 00:21:57.150
illegal.

375
00:21:57.150 --> 00:22:01.890
So private banquets that just happened to feature political speeches were away

376
00:22:01.891 --> 00:22:02.810
around this law.

377
00:22:03.040 --> 00:22:07.050
Tens of thousands attended among them Friedrich Engels of the communist

378
00:22:07.250 --> 00:22:12.120
manifesto by January, 1848. Though, the banquet campaign has mostly fizzled out.

379
00:22:12.340 --> 00:22:15.400
The organizers decided to put together one last grands,

380
00:22:15.520 --> 00:22:18.880
one in Paris to cap off the year's work. Only this banquet.

381
00:22:19.060 --> 00:22:22.320
It didn't go ahead fed up with even this limited freedom of speech,

382
00:22:22.340 --> 00:22:26.480
the Gizo government banned at the last second. This was a big deal.

383
00:22:26.710 --> 00:22:29.670
Even under the July monarchy people, they had a right to assemble.

384
00:22:29.880 --> 00:22:30.790
After some debate,

385
00:22:30.850 --> 00:22:33.990
the organizers decided to reschedule for February the 20 seconds.

386
00:22:34.220 --> 00:22:38.510
They would hold a symbolic banquet just to prove that they still had rights and

387
00:22:38.511 --> 00:22:41.230
then disperse without making any political speeches.

388
00:22:41.500 --> 00:22:43.110
That was how on February the 22nd,

389
00:22:43.390 --> 00:22:47.990
1848 Paris found itself hosting thousands upon thousands of super

390
00:22:48.060 --> 00:22:48.893
politicized,

391
00:22:49.510 --> 00:22:53.900
angry and primed to believe that canceling the day's banquet would signal the

392
00:22:54.140 --> 00:22:56.020
complete stripping of their rights.

393
00:22:56.280 --> 00:22:58.540
If you've watched our other 19th century videos,

394
00:22:58.541 --> 00:23:03.020
you may have heard a joke before about how a ban on banquet somehow sparked a

395
00:23:03.021 --> 00:23:06.220
revolution in France in 1848. Well,

396
00:23:06.450 --> 00:23:10.690
this is how faced with all these hostile people, right in the heart of Paris.

397
00:23:11.330 --> 00:23:12.690
Gizo canceled the banquet. Anyway,

398
00:23:12.700 --> 00:23:17.450
these hostile people then did what Banque hostile people tend to do within hours

399
00:23:17.451 --> 00:23:21.050
of the cancellation barricades were springing up across the city workers.

400
00:23:21.560 --> 00:23:24.410
They were arming themselves by the morning of February,

401
00:23:24.411 --> 00:23:27.250
the 23rd Paris was a gigantic Tinder box.

402
00:23:27.470 --> 00:23:29.610
The city was paralyzed by crowds.

403
00:23:30.110 --> 00:23:33.920
Ding Gizo head terrified by what he had unleashed Gizo resigned,

404
00:23:34.020 --> 00:23:37.000
but then some random soldier decided to throw a match onto the highly

405
00:23:37.001 --> 00:23:41.680
combustible situation by opening fire on the crowds that had gathered to hear GI

406
00:23:41.780 --> 00:23:45.720
O's resignation. When the smoke cleared 52 Persians were dead.

407
00:23:46.280 --> 00:23:50.520
This massacre, when it caused the volcano to blow its top by Dawn of February,

408
00:23:50.521 --> 00:23:53.040
the 24th, the French capital, it was out of control.

409
00:23:53.220 --> 00:23:56.840
The army was muting and the national guard were joining the revolutionaries

410
00:23:57.290 --> 00:23:57.641
today.

411
00:23:57.641 --> 00:24:01.200
Some historians think that if Louis Felipe had ordered loyal regimens of the

412
00:24:01.201 --> 00:24:04.280
army to attack the city that July monarchy could have survived.

413
00:24:04.730 --> 00:24:07.390
But here's the thing about Louis Philippe at heart.

414
00:24:07.810 --> 00:24:11.230
He wanted to be loved for all of his faults. This was a man who,

415
00:24:11.231 --> 00:24:14.750
when king had wandered the streets of Paris in a businessman's suit,

416
00:24:14.751 --> 00:24:18.190
shaking hands with his subjects. He was ambitious. Yes,

417
00:24:18.410 --> 00:24:22.870
but he also genuinely believed that he was popular to cast that last illusion

418
00:24:23.080 --> 00:24:27.540
aside by attacking Paris, it was was just simply a step too far. That date,

419
00:24:27.900 --> 00:24:31.380
February the 24th, 1848, Louie Felipe abdicated the French crown.

420
00:24:31.520 --> 00:24:32.280
At the last moment,

421
00:24:32.280 --> 00:24:35.860
he tried to take a leap from Charles the tenths playbook and make his grandson

422
00:24:36.090 --> 00:24:36.560
king.

423
00:24:36.560 --> 00:24:41.340
But what hadn't worked for Charles did not work for Louie Felipe on February the

424
00:24:41.740 --> 00:24:43.540
26th, 1848 with France in revolt,

425
00:24:43.600 --> 00:24:47.570
the French monarchy was abolished for are good. There would be no more Kings,

426
00:24:47.750 --> 00:24:50.970
no more Queens. The last chapter of the monarchy attended not in glory,

427
00:24:51.070 --> 00:24:54.250
but with Louis Philipp fleeing into aile. However,

428
00:24:55.250 --> 00:24:57.930
there was a postscript across Europe, the July monarchies collapse.

429
00:24:57.931 --> 00:25:01.930
It triggered a wave of revolutions in Austria, Hungary, Italy,

430
00:25:01.950 --> 00:25:03.490
and PRUs old certainties.

431
00:25:03.491 --> 00:25:07.320
They were now swept away and new stories were written back in France.

432
00:25:07.460 --> 00:25:08.840
The end of Louisie Felipe story.

433
00:25:08.841 --> 00:25:13.440
It wounds up being the start of another man's that's right it's time for

434
00:25:13.441 --> 00:25:15.720
Napoleon the third to step back into the spotlight.

435
00:25:15.940 --> 00:25:17.920
Within months of Louis Felipe's fall,

436
00:25:18.060 --> 00:25:22.760
the bumbling co plotter was riding this latest wave of revolution just as

437
00:25:23.200 --> 00:25:27.110
Louie Felipe had with the July revolution on December the 10th nap in the third

438
00:25:27.111 --> 00:25:29.910
became the first ever president of France. Not four years later,

439
00:25:30.010 --> 00:25:31.910
he declared himself emperor for life.

440
00:25:32.290 --> 00:25:34.950
As an apparently in the third was snatching Louis Philipp's crown.

441
00:25:35.130 --> 00:25:39.910
Now with extra Imperial trimming. The one time duke was settling into a short,

442
00:25:40.710 --> 00:25:44.830
unhappy retirement in England. And we mean short on August the 26th, 18, 15,

443
00:25:44.850 --> 00:25:48.660
not three years after his final Revolut and Louis Philipp passed away.

444
00:25:49.080 --> 00:25:53.940
He was 76. So was Louis Philipp, a tyrant schema? What was he just done?

445
00:25:54.220 --> 00:25:56.940
Lucky, maybe more likely. He was just an anachronism,

446
00:25:57.460 --> 00:26:02.020
a man who decided that he had one day be king and fulfilled their dream just as

447
00:26:02.021 --> 00:26:05.940
France was deciding that it no longer needed a monarchy today.

448
00:26:05.941 --> 00:26:09.010
The last king of the French is little more than a footnote in history,

449
00:26:09.150 --> 00:26:13.050
but we shouldn't let that distract us from the miracle that was Louis Felipe's

450
00:26:13.051 --> 00:26:17.290
turbulent life. He was a man who survived three separate French revolutions.

451
00:26:17.500 --> 00:26:21.930
Three times. He found himself at the epicenter of European history in the end,

452
00:26:22.150 --> 00:26:27.050
his entire life was perhaps no different from that of the 16 year old boy

453
00:26:27.400 --> 00:26:28.360
that had once bin,

454
00:26:28.580 --> 00:26:32.440
the boy who leaned out of his window above the women's March on Versai

455
00:26:32.960 --> 00:26:36.320
determined to witness history. So I really hope you found that video.
