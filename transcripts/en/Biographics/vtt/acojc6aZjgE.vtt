<v 0>Just before we get started with today's video,</v>

2
00:00:01.741 --> 00:00:05.190
I do want to see that it's brought to you by another channel that I host called

3
00:00:05.191 --> 00:00:09.180
highlight history. It's a channel all about history, no shock there.

4
00:00:09.310 --> 00:00:12.540
Recent topics include whether George Washington's doctors killed him.

5
00:00:12.541 --> 00:00:16.290
They kind of did the man who stole the crown jewels and got away with it and

6
00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:20.160
much more. Please do check it out through the link in the description below.

7
00:00:20.161 --> 00:00:24.150
If you like, what you see, please do subscribe and let's get into today's video.

8
00:00:30.500 --> 00:00:32.090
It's all worried about successful pirates,

9
00:00:32.091 --> 00:00:34.550
something we've done quite a bit on this channel.

10
00:00:34.790 --> 00:00:39.080
You may come to images of some rugged bidded European bloke,

11
00:00:39.081 --> 00:00:42.080
a captain in commands of a handful of ships and a few hundred men.

12
00:00:42.170 --> 00:00:45.920
He may have stolen a few hundred thousand Spanish dollars and may exert control

13
00:00:45.921 --> 00:00:50.450
over a sea routes between I don't know, Yucatan and Cuba, and that's not bad,

14
00:00:50.750 --> 00:00:51.950
but that's definitely naughty yet.

15
00:00:52.190 --> 00:00:55.700
That's because arguably the most successful pirate in history was a Chinese

16
00:00:55.701 --> 00:01:00.110
Admiral in charge of a vast fleet of hundreds of vessels mans by

17
00:01:00.111 --> 00:01:02.180
70,000 men at its peak.

18
00:01:02.240 --> 00:01:05.210
This virus had total control over a huge coastal area,

19
00:01:05.390 --> 00:01:08.000
humiliating the Navy's of at least three major powers.

20
00:01:08.390 --> 00:01:10.490
And this pirates was a sheep.

21
00:01:10.550 --> 00:01:13.970
She was known as [inaudible] or Chiang Shao.

22
00:01:14.030 --> 00:01:17.090
She was a master of diplomacy of trade and of Naval strategy.

23
00:01:17.270 --> 00:01:20.590
She was the undisputed pirate queen of the South China sea.

24
00:01:26.540 --> 00:01:27.110
<v 1>[Inaudible].</v>

25
00:01:27.110 --> 00:01:29.930
<v 0>I'd love to give you some details about the birth and early life for today's</v>

26
00:01:29.931 --> 00:01:30.770
protagonist,

27
00:01:30.800 --> 00:01:35.600
but the truth is this origins were so humble and obscure that we don't even

28
00:01:35.601 --> 00:01:40.160
know her exact date and place of birth sometime around 1771,

29
00:01:40.220 --> 00:01:44.570
somewhere in Southern China, we are not even certain about her real name,

30
00:01:44.571 --> 00:01:48.920
official records and histories refer to her by the names Chiang South Chiang's

31
00:01:48.921 --> 00:01:51.050
wife or Chang. She Chang's widow.

32
00:01:51.080 --> 00:01:54.740
So we can only imagine that the unnamed little girl was born to a family of poor

33
00:01:54.741 --> 00:01:58.670
farmers or fishermen, somewhere along the coast of Canton province.

34
00:01:58.760 --> 00:02:02.810
We can only presume that she fought her way through disease and starvation,

35
00:02:02.811 --> 00:02:06.950
fending off infant deaths and slowly reaching adults while she grows up.

36
00:02:06.980 --> 00:02:11.060
I will give you some historical context, which will prove key to our story.

37
00:02:11.120 --> 00:02:12.350
In the late 18th century,

38
00:02:12.380 --> 00:02:16.520
China was a United and powerful state sums of the rule of Ambra.

39
00:02:16.760 --> 00:02:20.990
She had long succeeded by JIA Ching in 1796,

40
00:02:21.080 --> 00:02:25.160
both emperors belonged to the stable and powerful Ching dynasty and had

41
00:02:25.161 --> 00:02:28.760
succeeded in expanding China's territories and riches. However,

42
00:02:28.820 --> 00:02:33.440
they both had failed at modernizing the empire to keep up with a massive

43
00:02:33.441 --> 00:02:35.570
population spout to over-simplify.

44
00:02:35.600 --> 00:02:39.530
Many farmers were left with too little arable land to sustain themselves,

45
00:02:39.740 --> 00:02:43.700
leading them to seek other profitable trades and not necessarily on the right

46
00:02:43.701 --> 00:02:45.410
side of the law. At the same time,

47
00:02:45.411 --> 00:02:49.250
the Chinese civil service did not expand in proportions of the population.

48
00:02:49.430 --> 00:02:52.910
Hence local government duties fell into the hands of local leaders whose

49
00:02:52.911 --> 00:02:57.740
allegiances were to their localities and families rather than to the state.

50
00:02:57.800 --> 00:03:01.810
This situation created perfect set of conditions for the rise of local warlords

51
00:03:01.900 --> 00:03:04.600
and rebellious factions, such as the white Lotus,

52
00:03:04.660 --> 00:03:06.430
struggling to maintain its own lot.

53
00:03:06.470 --> 00:03:10.660
The Chinese military was significantly weakened and depleted of resources

54
00:03:10.690 --> 00:03:15.070
leading to the emergence of even more regional warlords among them,

55
00:03:15.130 --> 00:03:17.590
especially in the Southern province of quantum.

56
00:03:17.770 --> 00:03:22.510
One could find powerful pirate Lords infesting the waters of the South

57
00:03:22.511 --> 00:03:26.740
China sea in the 1790s, the Southern pirates were on the rise.

58
00:03:26.770 --> 00:03:30.940
Thanks to rich patronage provided by Vietnam there in 1792,

59
00:03:31.120 --> 00:03:35.080
then UN brothers that a successful bid for power. The tapes on rebellion,

60
00:03:35.260 --> 00:03:37.840
the youngest brother had become Vietnamese emperor,

61
00:03:38.320 --> 00:03:41.410
Chiang trunk to feeding the rival lead dynasty.

62
00:03:41.540 --> 00:03:44.890
After the rebellion quadroon had lost most of its Navy.

63
00:03:44.920 --> 00:03:47.800
So he took to hiring Chinese pirates as privateers.

64
00:03:47.920 --> 00:03:51.040
A typical Chinese privateer could afford a fleet of several dozen junks

65
00:03:51.370 --> 00:03:54.100
mountains by hundreds of Seders among these disparate gangs.

66
00:03:54.101 --> 00:03:58.750
One emerged as the most powerful the fleet commanders by Chang E a man of

67
00:03:58.751 --> 00:04:03.640
ambition who sought to unify and merge the major pirate fleets and do one single

68
00:04:03.641 --> 00:04:04.474
dominant force.

69
00:04:11.220 --> 00:04:14.400
Now we can go back to our protagonist by 1801.

70
00:04:14.401 --> 00:04:17.460
She was in her late teens or early twenties as expected.

71
00:04:17.520 --> 00:04:22.500
Widespread poverty had forced her into a disreputable trade prostitution.

72
00:04:22.590 --> 00:04:27.000
She pedaled her trade aboard one of several fluting brothels in Kansas on these

73
00:04:27.001 --> 00:04:28.440
refined boots of pleasure.

74
00:04:28.470 --> 00:04:32.850
Patrons could enjoy a meal and a concert before moving on to the main

75
00:04:32.851 --> 00:04:33.840
entertainment. If you like,

76
00:04:33.900 --> 00:04:37.230
which apparently was made even more pleasurable by the gentle rocking and

77
00:04:37.231 --> 00:04:38.250
rolling of the vessels.

78
00:04:38.310 --> 00:04:42.120
She was renowned as one of the most beautiful girls on the floating palaces

79
00:04:42.630 --> 00:04:45.990
admired for her looks as well as our charming and intelligent personality.

80
00:04:46.020 --> 00:04:50.640
These were qualities which did not go unnoticed to pirate Lords Chang E

81
00:04:50.760 --> 00:04:52.680
according to some versions of the story.

82
00:04:53.010 --> 00:04:54.930
Jenny was so smitten with the girl's beauty,

83
00:04:54.931 --> 00:04:58.440
grace and intellects that he courted her for weeks before proposing to her.

84
00:04:58.530 --> 00:04:59.640
According to other versions,

85
00:04:59.641 --> 00:05:02.250
the pirate Lord was initially motivated by pure lust.

86
00:05:02.640 --> 00:05:06.150
You had the girl kidnapped and brought onto his ship just to have all for

87
00:05:06.151 --> 00:05:08.580
himself, whatever origin story you prefer.

88
00:05:08.610 --> 00:05:13.590
The next chapter is agreed upon the girl happily and willingly became Chang ESL,

89
00:05:13.591 --> 00:05:16.140
the wife of Cheney butts on one condition.

90
00:05:16.290 --> 00:05:18.780
She was not going to be relegated to the shore,

91
00:05:18.781 --> 00:05:20.520
playing the role of the worried wife,

92
00:05:20.521 --> 00:05:24.090
waiting for the adventurous husband to come home or even worse.

93
00:05:24.091 --> 00:05:27.090
She was not going to be relegated to the bed chamber. No,

94
00:05:27.120 --> 00:05:30.360
she wanted to take pots in Chinese strategic decisions,

95
00:05:30.361 --> 00:05:32.580
lead the fleet at his side,

96
00:05:32.610 --> 00:05:37.380
sharing both the risks and the rewards of piracy and a decision on common at

97
00:05:37.381 --> 00:05:39.390
that time. And in that line of work,

98
00:05:39.870 --> 00:05:42.870
Jenny accepted and made Mrs. Jang privy to his ambitions,

99
00:05:42.871 --> 00:05:46.800
unifying the Southern Chinese pirates before achieving that goal,

100
00:05:46.801 --> 00:05:51.390
that a couple of found time to enlarge their family and a rather unconventional

101
00:05:51.391 --> 00:05:54.120
way sometime in 1801, Shang his pirates.

102
00:05:54.240 --> 00:05:57.560
It captured the 15 year old son of a fishermen Chiang pal.

103
00:05:58.010 --> 00:06:01.940
Jenny personally introduced him to a life of piracy by taking him as his lover.

104
00:06:02.030 --> 00:06:05.900
This isn't a particular surprise as homosexual and bisexual relationships were

105
00:06:05.901 --> 00:06:09.800
common amongst sea rovers of all ages and latitudes.

106
00:06:09.860 --> 00:06:13.430
The boy showed promise and the Chang's gave him command of a junk Chen.

107
00:06:13.460 --> 00:06:17.570
He even adopted the teenage captain. This was no ordinary adoption though,

108
00:06:17.571 --> 00:06:21.590
which was just illegal apply to ensure inheritance rights for his protege.

109
00:06:21.740 --> 00:06:23.270
As Chang Powell grew older,

110
00:06:23.271 --> 00:06:26.930
it appears that Mrs. Chang was also involved in the relationship making it one

111
00:06:26.931 --> 00:06:31.070
of those affairs that the French golden Menasha trois. Now add to the mix.

112
00:06:31.071 --> 00:06:34.700
The fact that the Changs were formerly Chiang pals parents. And well,

113
00:06:34.880 --> 00:06:37.850
let's just say that if Dr. Freud had been born several decades earlier,

114
00:06:37.851 --> 00:06:41.150
had relocated to China and opened a floating clinic in cans on well,

115
00:06:41.540 --> 00:06:42.740
he would have made a fortune,

116
00:06:42.770 --> 00:06:46.790
but the happy family has other concerns in mind in July of 1802,

117
00:06:46.970 --> 00:06:51.230
an occasion to unify the Southern pirates had finally materialized the taste on

118
00:06:51.231 --> 00:06:52.970
forces in Vietnam had been defeated,

119
00:06:53.000 --> 00:06:56.060
meaning the privateers had lost their primary employer.

120
00:06:56.120 --> 00:07:00.110
The Chang's seize the day and establish their own leadership by reorganizing the

121
00:07:00.111 --> 00:07:04.700
directionless pirates North of the Sino Vietnamese border in the Quantong

122
00:07:04.730 --> 00:07:05.300
province,

123
00:07:05.300 --> 00:07:09.620
they successfully organized a conglomerate of small gangs into six large fleets

124
00:07:09.621 --> 00:07:14.270
under the red, black, white, green, blue, and yellow flags by 1804,

125
00:07:14.300 --> 00:07:16.490
the six fleets were in perfect running order.

126
00:07:16.580 --> 00:07:18.200
The red fleet was the most powerful one,

127
00:07:18.230 --> 00:07:21.590
boasting 300 ships and 40,000 men altogether.

128
00:07:21.620 --> 00:07:25.250
The Alliance forces numbered 400 vessels and 70,000 men.

129
00:07:25.460 --> 00:07:28.880
This was not a gang of pirates anymore. It wasn't even a crime syndicate.

130
00:07:29.030 --> 00:07:33.950
This was a Navy capable of holding its own against any sovereign

131
00:07:33.951 --> 00:07:38.090
nation. Chiang might have appeared as the charismatic leader with the hands-on

132
00:07:38.091 --> 00:07:39.980
experience and practical resume,

133
00:07:40.250 --> 00:07:44.840
but the true strategic genius behind the lack of screen was

134
00:07:45.290 --> 00:07:46.010
Chinese Sao.

135
00:07:46.010 --> 00:07:49.880
She had showed the leadership of each fleet was in the hands of trusted

136
00:07:49.881 --> 00:07:50.690
subordinates.

137
00:07:50.690 --> 00:07:53.780
They had some limited degree of autonomy over the running of their fleet,

138
00:07:53.930 --> 00:07:55.580
but were tied by personal law,

139
00:07:55.610 --> 00:07:59.810
familial obligations to Chang E ensuring ultimate loyalty.

140
00:08:00.020 --> 00:08:02.720
Mr. And Mrs. Chang's fleet was so successful that within a year,

141
00:08:02.721 --> 00:08:05.870
the Imperial authorities weren't able to cope with the pirate threat.

142
00:08:06.050 --> 00:08:09.650
The sea rovers upon Tang indirectly caused the downfall of the provincial

143
00:08:09.651 --> 00:08:13.520
commander in chief. They directly killed his leading military commander,

144
00:08:13.550 --> 00:08:17.180
general hung known as the old tiger the success. However,

145
00:08:17.181 --> 00:08:21.470
glorious was short-lived. The husbands and wife team was doomed to fall apart.

146
00:08:21.471 --> 00:08:22.304
Soon after.

147
00:08:27.790 --> 00:08:28.360
<v 3>[Inaudible].</v>

148
00:08:28.360 --> 00:08:31.600
<v 0>In 1907, the undefeated Admiral Chang died suddenly,</v>

149
00:08:31.660 --> 00:08:33.790
probably in a storm off the coast of Vietnam.

150
00:08:33.880 --> 00:08:35.650
His wife would come to be known as Chang.

151
00:08:36.130 --> 00:08:40.050
She Chang's widow tradition dictated that she retired to a chest widowhood,

152
00:08:40.060 --> 00:08:40.780
a quiet life,

153
00:08:40.780 --> 00:08:44.740
maybe tending to Yardbirds in the garden or drinking tea on the seashore,

154
00:08:44.800 --> 00:08:47.140
all this while perhaps admiring from afar,

155
00:08:47.141 --> 00:08:51.640
the spectacle of an Imperial ship being blown up by the cannon fire of a pirate

156
00:08:51.641 --> 00:08:53.530
junk, but Chang, she wouldn't hear any of this.

157
00:08:53.560 --> 00:08:56.610
Her ideal retirements was never to have one in the first place.

158
00:08:56.700 --> 00:09:00.570
The crafty pirate queen moved immediately to establish a position as the new

159
00:09:00.571 --> 00:09:02.700
Admiral of the combined fleets. First of all,

160
00:09:02.760 --> 00:09:04.350
she secured the support of her late.

161
00:09:04.351 --> 00:09:08.820
Husband's two most powerful chief Dan's Chang and Pang and Chang power yang.

162
00:09:09.270 --> 00:09:10.620
Then she appointed Chang pow,

163
00:09:10.640 --> 00:09:14.790
her adopted son as leader of the most powerful red fleet and to cement their

164
00:09:14.791 --> 00:09:18.660
Alliance. She had no qualms and ends during an open monogamous, sexual,

165
00:09:18.661 --> 00:09:21.090
and dramatic relationship with him. So yes,

166
00:09:21.091 --> 00:09:25.620
she married her adoptive son with strategic and diplomatic skills or widowed

167
00:09:25.621 --> 00:09:28.860
manage to retain the services of the leaders of the multi-colored fleets.

168
00:09:29.070 --> 00:09:32.790
They all agreed that by working together as they would be more effective,

169
00:09:32.910 --> 00:09:34.320
perhaps most importantly,

170
00:09:34.321 --> 00:09:39.240
they agreed to work together under Chiang Shi and Chang pow Jang she's next move

171
00:09:39.390 --> 00:09:41.040
was to further consolidate her power.

172
00:09:41.070 --> 00:09:44.430
She did so by establishing a strict code of rules and punishments to maintain

173
00:09:44.431 --> 00:09:47.490
discipline and, and effective chain of command in a sprawling.

174
00:09:47.491 --> 00:09:50.780
Our motto here are some of the laws of widow Chang. Well,

175
00:09:50.781 --> 00:09:54.350
one orders should follow a strict top-down chain of commands. Yeah.

176
00:09:54.380 --> 00:09:55.670
If as a lowly pirate,

177
00:09:55.671 --> 00:09:58.940
you disobeyed orders from a superior or gave orders of your own,

178
00:09:59.150 --> 00:10:02.030
your head would be chopped off on the spot. Number two,

179
00:10:02.270 --> 00:10:06.500
any rate or business transaction had to be vetted by Chang sheet backed by the

180
00:10:06.740 --> 00:10:09.800
might of the red fleet. She control the activities of every single junk.

181
00:10:09.890 --> 00:10:11.390
After a successful rate at sea,

182
00:10:11.391 --> 00:10:14.120
the loot was to be supervised by an accountant Chang.

183
00:10:14.121 --> 00:10:17.120
She allowed the crew to keep 20% of that booty Airbus.

184
00:10:17.300 --> 00:10:21.290
The rest had to be accumulated into a public funds. The Congress young,

185
00:10:21.440 --> 00:10:24.860
if you pilfered from that funds. Well, yeah, your head would get chopped off.

186
00:10:24.950 --> 00:10:27.800
Number three, women captured during raids should suffer no harm.

187
00:10:27.860 --> 00:10:30.530
They were too profitable. Well, good looking captives.

188
00:10:30.531 --> 00:10:33.230
At least they were to be sold into prostitution or slavery.

189
00:10:33.410 --> 00:10:36.590
Not so good looking girls when I'm lucky enough to be freed almost immediately.

190
00:10:36.750 --> 00:10:39.950
But what if a pirate raped one of the VMR prisoners? Well,

191
00:10:40.100 --> 00:10:41.000
they would have his head chopped off.

192
00:10:41.120 --> 00:10:43.940
And if the pirate queen had consensual sex with a prisoner, well,

193
00:10:44.090 --> 00:10:45.320
they both get their heads chopped off.

194
00:10:45.500 --> 00:10:47.030
That was the way I was at that punishment though.

195
00:10:47.031 --> 00:10:51.830
A pirate could choose to take a captive as his concubine or wife bus if he did.

196
00:10:51.831 --> 00:10:56.180
So he was obliged to remain faithful to her for life. If he didn't sweat,

197
00:10:56.300 --> 00:10:59.360
he'd get his head chopped off. And number four don't harm the villages.

198
00:10:59.390 --> 00:11:01.310
At least not the airline ones, Chang.

199
00:11:01.311 --> 00:11:05.150
She had organized a network of coastal villages as supply basis for our fleet.

200
00:11:05.390 --> 00:11:07.970
If you stole from those villages, of course,

201
00:11:07.971 --> 00:11:12.590
your body would be severed from your head in a Swift cutting motion.

202
00:11:12.830 --> 00:11:15.470
Finally, if you deserted all ENS a while, your ears would be,

203
00:11:15.680 --> 00:11:18.710
cause often you would be paraded in front of your scenario. And in cremates,

204
00:11:18.800 --> 00:11:22.580
if these laws were melting off Jang G and Jang bough also devised another

205
00:11:22.581 --> 00:11:24.260
scheme, do you control their subordinates?

206
00:11:24.410 --> 00:11:28.610
The quandong pirates were very religious and always besieged their gods before

207
00:11:28.611 --> 00:11:32.570
going out for an expedition to facilitate that pres John bow ordered for a

208
00:11:32.571 --> 00:11:36.200
magnificent 10 bolt to be built on one of the ships before major actions,

209
00:11:36.500 --> 00:11:36.801
Chang bow,

210
00:11:36.801 --> 00:11:41.060
and his lieutenants met at the temple to pray burn incense and confer with the

211
00:11:41.061 --> 00:11:44.240
priest seeking divine approval for their plans. Miraculously,

212
00:11:44.241 --> 00:11:48.620
the God seemed to always agree with Chiang Xi and Chang pals battle plans. Well,

213
00:11:48.621 --> 00:11:51.920
the reason was quite easy to spot the two admirals simply met with the priests

214
00:11:51.921 --> 00:11:52.431
beforehand,

215
00:11:52.431 --> 00:11:56.860
exposed their and ensure that they would get divine backing during the public

216
00:11:56.861 --> 00:11:57.610
ceremonies.

217
00:11:57.610 --> 00:12:01.990
Now you may rule over 70,000 hardens men by the cover use of smoke and mirrors

218
00:12:01.991 --> 00:12:04.840
and by the ruthless wielding of the stick,

219
00:12:05.020 --> 00:12:07.540
but you also need to dangle the carrot Jang.

220
00:12:07.541 --> 00:12:11.290
She knew this very well and she realized that to keep them in rich fat and

221
00:12:11.291 --> 00:12:14.620
happy. The Newt stolen at sea may not be enough.

222
00:12:21.000 --> 00:12:21.833
<v 1>Chang. She followed.</v>

223
00:12:22.140 --> 00:12:25.470
<v 0>Passing common. So many successful criminal organizations in history is that,</v>

224
00:12:25.471 --> 00:12:29.070
is she branched out into a legitimate business enterprise in her case,

225
00:12:29.100 --> 00:12:30.060
it was the salt trade.

226
00:12:30.270 --> 00:12:34.320
One of the most profitable in the contact area between 1807 and 1810,

227
00:12:34.350 --> 00:12:38.610
the Chinese government employed a total of 270 junks collecting souls from the

228
00:12:39.060 --> 00:12:41.940
Salters at TN PI and hauling it to Kansan Chang.

229
00:12:41.941 --> 00:12:44.820
She had deployed two squadrons along the routes,

230
00:12:44.821 --> 00:12:48.930
the first Indian pie itself and to the other on the fortress islands of now

231
00:12:49.380 --> 00:12:51.510
ciao. One of the favorite hideouts from there,

232
00:12:51.511 --> 00:12:55.970
the pirate junks relentlessly assaulted the Imperial soul ships capturing both

233
00:12:55.990 --> 00:12:57.120
the vessels in the cargo.

234
00:12:57.240 --> 00:13:01.680
Eventually the empire retains control over just four of them. Merchant ships,

235
00:13:02.010 --> 00:13:05.340
Chang she's genius stroke was not to contend herself with selling the stolen

236
00:13:05.341 --> 00:13:05.880
salt.

237
00:13:05.880 --> 00:13:09.390
She goes into the business by forcing the captured cruise to continue hauling

238
00:13:09.690 --> 00:13:12.630
salt on her terms, seeding a large part of the profits.

239
00:13:12.750 --> 00:13:16.680
The widows are mater had established total arms control over the salt trade

240
00:13:16.681 --> 00:13:17.220
routes.

241
00:13:17.220 --> 00:13:21.210
And the South China sea one could say that she had established a monopoly of

242
00:13:21.211 --> 00:13:22.650
violence over the area.

243
00:13:22.740 --> 00:13:26.730
This is a term which was later coined to describe the activities of the Sicilian

244
00:13:26.731 --> 00:13:31.470
mafia decades later, but it does fit perfectly here. It was a simple reality.

245
00:13:31.560 --> 00:13:36.120
The pirates were the only ones who could decide if somebody would be harmed on

246
00:13:36.390 --> 00:13:36.510
it,

247
00:13:36.510 --> 00:13:40.260
unable to seek protection from the Basset Chinese Imperial Navy merchants in the

248
00:13:40.261 --> 00:13:40.561
South,

249
00:13:40.561 --> 00:13:44.190
China sea found it less risky and less costly to simply pay protection money to

250
00:13:44.191 --> 00:13:48.720
Chang. She buying themselves safe passage on those otherwise treacherous routes.

251
00:13:48.810 --> 00:13:53.340
This practice was applied to all sorts of trades, not just sold since by 1809.

252
00:13:53.520 --> 00:13:57.600
It extended to the coastal villages, especially those on the Pearl river Delta.

253
00:13:57.780 --> 00:14:01.980
As I said, protection, money is something you normally associate with the mafia,

254
00:14:02.010 --> 00:14:04.800
but Chang, she was no Dawn for Nucci.

255
00:14:05.010 --> 00:14:09.480
She had no time to stroll around small businesses, pocketing envelopes of cash.

256
00:14:09.540 --> 00:14:12.300
She had ambition as an entrepreneurial mind.

257
00:14:12.450 --> 00:14:15.690
She had set up financial offices in every major town on the coast,

258
00:14:15.691 --> 00:14:17.640
especially Kansan and Macau.

259
00:14:18.180 --> 00:14:20.700
Their agents collected fees from fishermen and traders,

260
00:14:20.820 --> 00:14:24.720
selling them official documents, exempting them from pirates attacks.

261
00:14:24.750 --> 00:14:28.980
The agents then reinvested the cash they collected into buying weapons and

262
00:14:28.981 --> 00:14:32.940
ammunition for the fleet. It was indeed a vicious nautical and bar,

263
00:14:33.210 --> 00:14:36.930
but it was certainly one that ran like clockwork to maintain a monopoly of

264
00:14:36.931 --> 00:14:40.950
violence Chang. She could even rely on a sophisticated intelligence network.

265
00:14:41.070 --> 00:14:41.970
Initially farmers,

266
00:14:42.000 --> 00:14:45.780
fishermen and other coast dwellers were eager to cooperate with the pirate fleet

267
00:14:45.790 --> 00:14:50.790
selling information on the whereabouts of enticing prey or enemy ships later on

268
00:14:51.060 --> 00:14:54.230
Shang secured the cooperation of bandit gang secret societies,

269
00:14:54.231 --> 00:14:56.240
even corrupt state officials,

270
00:14:56.360 --> 00:14:59.510
ultimately the supply chain and intelligence service created by Chang.

271
00:14:59.510 --> 00:15:03.980
She fed into the real muscle behind the power, the military prowess of a fleet.

272
00:15:04.130 --> 00:15:06.380
She organized the larger fleets into powerful squadrons,

273
00:15:06.381 --> 00:15:09.860
which attacked in cohesive formations, resembling floating fortresses,

274
00:15:10.100 --> 00:15:13.930
native hastily, armed junks, Jang pals, personal squadron, for example,

275
00:15:13.940 --> 00:15:18.200
consisted of 36 vessels mans by 1,422 men

276
00:15:18.410 --> 00:15:20.420
operating more than 200 cannons.

277
00:15:20.510 --> 00:15:23.060
The Imperial Navy was no match for such a force.

278
00:15:23.061 --> 00:15:27.530
And there are accounts of admirals in Kwon Tung sabotaging their own ships to

279
00:15:27.531 --> 00:15:29.900
avoid a confrontation with Chiang sheep.

280
00:15:30.200 --> 00:15:34.700
Dan bruh tried to deploy forces from other provinces, but to no avail in 1808.

281
00:15:34.701 --> 00:15:35.241
For example,

282
00:15:35.241 --> 00:15:38.780
the military commander in chief of check gang province was dispatched to him,

283
00:15:38.781 --> 00:15:43.100
telling him in an effort to protect Kansan with 135 ships and deal with the

284
00:15:43.101 --> 00:15:45.170
pirates once. And for all it didn't work.

285
00:15:45.230 --> 00:15:48.170
The Czech young general was killed in battle. And within six months,

286
00:15:48.171 --> 00:15:52.970
the red fleet had destroyed 63 of the Imperial junks with little opposition at

287
00:15:52.971 --> 00:15:55.970
sea Chang sheet moved to attack coastal forts and garrisons.

288
00:15:56.180 --> 00:15:59.630
A favorite tactic was to engage the positions from a fall by having one of our

289
00:15:59.631 --> 00:16:02.930
large squadrons deliver devastating barrage of cannon fire.

290
00:16:03.080 --> 00:16:05.270
While the Garrison's artillery was on the defensive,

291
00:16:05.271 --> 00:16:08.090
they failed to notice smaller junks carrying a landing party.

292
00:16:08.180 --> 00:16:10.100
The amphibious force then storms the walls,

293
00:16:10.101 --> 00:16:12.680
engaging the borne down defenders in close quarters.

294
00:16:12.740 --> 00:16:16.040
This is where the pirates excels. There are no confirms accounts of Chang.

295
00:16:16.041 --> 00:16:20.180
She taking part in the fighting, but it is realistic to expect that she did not.

296
00:16:20.300 --> 00:16:21.680
As the overall leader, uh,

297
00:16:21.681 --> 00:16:25.130
strategic skills were far too valuable for her to risk death in a skirmish.

298
00:16:25.160 --> 00:16:26.000
There are however,

299
00:16:26.030 --> 00:16:30.410
several accounts of pirate wives fighting fiercely alongside the first lines or

300
00:16:30.420 --> 00:16:35.000
description of one of the few pirates defeats that Lao one Shan mentions a

301
00:16:35.001 --> 00:16:35.661
pirate wife.

302
00:16:35.661 --> 00:16:39.590
You killed or wounded several soldiers arms with a couple in each hands.

303
00:16:40.190 --> 00:16:42.550
Formidable women also fought on the other side and accounting.

304
00:16:42.630 --> 00:16:46.520
The battle between Chang bow and village militia features a formidable lady

305
00:16:46.521 --> 00:16:51.470
kicking pirate booty side-by-side next to a martial arts master husband Wei Tang

306
00:16:51.950 --> 00:16:55.520
ciao, overall display, fierce resistance, and the old defeat.

307
00:16:55.700 --> 00:16:59.870
Nobody in Quantong proved to be a match for the fleet of many colors.

308
00:16:59.900 --> 00:17:02.480
With few domestic enemies left to pray on Jang.

309
00:17:02.481 --> 00:17:05.000
She started then looking outwards.

310
00:17:11.140 --> 00:17:11.410
<v 2>[Inaudible].</v>

311
00:17:11.410 --> 00:17:14.950
<v 0>She's fleet escalated the attacks against ships belonging to foreign powers,</v>

312
00:17:14.951 --> 00:17:18.970
including Simon Portugal, the United States and the East India company.

313
00:17:19.090 --> 00:17:21.580
In a matter of days in September of 1809 Chang,

314
00:17:21.581 --> 00:17:26.080
she and Chang pow attacked a five American schooners in Macau captured the break

315
00:17:26.081 --> 00:17:29.590
belongings to the Portuguese governor in the team or colony and ransoms and

316
00:17:29.591 --> 00:17:31.990
entire tribute mission coming from Siam.

317
00:17:32.110 --> 00:17:35.480
These were by no means the first attacks against Western shipping. In fact,

318
00:17:35.850 --> 00:17:38.560
taxed by the Changs had been a nuisance and the British East India company in

319
00:17:38.561 --> 00:17:42.400
Portugal for more than a decade and AVS had offered to help in the fight against

320
00:17:42.401 --> 00:17:46.720
piracy, but the Imperial court had always refused mainly out of national pride.

321
00:17:46.870 --> 00:17:49.830
Finally, in the very same September, 1809,

322
00:17:49.831 --> 00:17:52.080
the emperor agreed to negotiate with the Westerners.

323
00:17:52.380 --> 00:17:55.590
The Chinese Navy secured help from six Portuguese men of war,

324
00:17:55.680 --> 00:17:59.220
as well as from an East India company ship gradually more and more Western

325
00:17:59.221 --> 00:18:02.640
vessels entered the fray, adding pressure on [inaudible] fleet.

326
00:18:02.730 --> 00:18:06.300
It eventually fell into numerical and technological disadvantage,

327
00:18:06.360 --> 00:18:09.600
the crafty widow Chang and her husband even tried to get the Portuguese to

328
00:18:09.601 --> 00:18:11.970
switch sides. On the 26th of December,

329
00:18:11.971 --> 00:18:15.870
the cheeky Chiang Powell sent a letter to the commander of the Portuguese fleets

330
00:18:15.960 --> 00:18:19.380
of Macau asking for three or four of them, men of war,

331
00:18:19.740 --> 00:18:22.470
Jang power reassured him that he was destined to topple the emperor.

332
00:18:22.471 --> 00:18:23.940
Very soon after the victory,

333
00:18:23.941 --> 00:18:27.330
he would have gifted two or three provinces to the Portuguese Admiral.

334
00:18:27.390 --> 00:18:30.180
The pirate Lords did not succeed in his negotiations,

335
00:18:30.181 --> 00:18:32.250
which were bad news for sheep by early 18,

336
00:18:32.251 --> 00:18:35.400
10 Chang she's fleet was showing the first signs of implosion.

337
00:18:35.430 --> 00:18:37.530
Then you enemies contributed to this for sure.

338
00:18:37.531 --> 00:18:41.850
But the main reason was the internal dissent among the fleets Lords Chang.

339
00:18:41.851 --> 00:18:45.780
She had a choice continue to fight against basically a half of the worlds or

340
00:18:45.781 --> 00:18:48.510
complete the transition to legitimate activities.

341
00:18:48.660 --> 00:18:51.930
The risk was to see her Naval empire crumbled to pieces.

342
00:18:51.931 --> 00:18:56.190
So loyal sailors and soldiers dragged into chains or blown to pieces.

343
00:18:56.250 --> 00:19:00.150
The other option was to seize an opportunity for negotiation and see how men off

344
00:19:00.300 --> 00:19:02.730
to a wealthy career before it was too late.

345
00:19:02.880 --> 00:19:06.000
She chose the latter option while she was still in a position of strength.

346
00:19:06.001 --> 00:19:07.680
So we do offer it the Chinese empire.

347
00:19:07.940 --> 00:19:08.930
<v 2>Attempting deal.</v>

348
00:19:15.470 --> 00:19:16.520
<v 0>The 21st 18,</v>

349
00:19:16.521 --> 00:19:20.840
10 Chang Sherry and Chang bow met with piling the governor general of the Leon

350
00:19:21.170 --> 00:19:21.771
Kwong territory,

351
00:19:21.771 --> 00:19:26.210
which encompassed Quantong and with Miguel Jose Arriaga era,

352
00:19:26.230 --> 00:19:30.020
Portuguese official from the colony and Macau, the widow's proposal was simple.

353
00:19:30.050 --> 00:19:33.230
She would dismantle a fleet and surrender most of our ships and weapons in

354
00:19:33.231 --> 00:19:33.950
exchange.

355
00:19:33.950 --> 00:19:38.480
She demanded a total pardon for herself and all of the pirates as well as

356
00:19:38.481 --> 00:19:41.090
official appointments for Chang Pau and other leaders.

357
00:19:41.180 --> 00:19:44.840
The final condition was for her and Chang pal to retain a small force of 80

358
00:19:44.841 --> 00:19:46.460
junks and 5,000 sailors.

359
00:19:46.550 --> 00:19:50.720
Their initial negotiations stalled when piling refused the Chang bow retained to

360
00:19:50.721 --> 00:19:52.010
such a sizable squadron,

361
00:19:52.070 --> 00:19:55.430
no progress was made until April of 1810 on the aides Chang.

362
00:19:55.431 --> 00:19:59.360
She resisted her advisor's concerns and bravely walked into pilings residence

363
00:19:59.361 --> 00:20:02.570
escorted only by the wives and children of some of our captains.

364
00:20:02.630 --> 00:20:05.540
The stubborn widow would not have no for an answer.

365
00:20:05.660 --> 00:20:08.540
If piling wanted to get rid of the nightmare, that was her fleet.

366
00:20:08.870 --> 00:20:11.570
He had to concede those 80 junks to Chang pal,

367
00:20:11.630 --> 00:20:16.100
and she even raised her demands further asking for 40 extra junks for the salt

368
00:20:16.101 --> 00:20:19.070
trade piling yielded. Two days later, he met with Chang,

369
00:20:19.071 --> 00:20:23.930
she and her staff at a pagoda in Macau where they signed the final deal immunity

370
00:20:23.931 --> 00:20:25.700
for all 120 junks,

371
00:20:26.120 --> 00:20:30.110
Chang bow and official appointments in the military and civilian administration

372
00:20:30.111 --> 00:20:31.310
for subordinate leaders,

373
00:20:31.370 --> 00:20:34.640
Jane power himself received a commission as a Lieutenant Colonel in the Imperial

374
00:20:34.641 --> 00:20:37.580
army receiving a promotion to Colonel. Soon after Jang,

375
00:20:37.880 --> 00:20:41.960
she was now considered to be the respectable wife of a young rising star within

376
00:20:41.961 --> 00:20:43.370
the military and as such,

377
00:20:43.371 --> 00:20:47.830
she would be addressed with the honorific title of Ming Sal 12 years later in

378
00:20:47.831 --> 00:20:48.664
1822,

379
00:20:48.940 --> 00:20:52.780
Chang Powell died perhaps during a storm like his adopted father after having

380
00:20:52.781 --> 00:20:57.160
enjoyed more than a decade of quiet life at the expenses of the state are twice

381
00:20:57.161 --> 00:20:57.994
widowed,

382
00:20:58.180 --> 00:21:01.660
protagonist settled back in Kansan with the two children she had from Chiang

383
00:21:01.661 --> 00:21:04.840
pal. Her last years of life were largely common prosperous.

384
00:21:05.020 --> 00:21:08.020
The ones pirate queen invested in the soul trait and opens gambling

385
00:21:08.021 --> 00:21:10.330
establishments in Kansan and Macau. Ironically,

386
00:21:10.331 --> 00:21:13.750
the one in Kansan also doubled as a brothel from her position of wealth.

387
00:21:13.780 --> 00:21:17.590
She observed how the power of the Chinese embar steadily declined in the 19th

388
00:21:17.591 --> 00:21:19.450
century, bullied by Western powers.

389
00:21:19.660 --> 00:21:23.530
It appears that around 1839 at the onset of the first opium war against the

390
00:21:23.531 --> 00:21:27.190
British, she may have been consulted by the current governor on matters of Naval

391
00:21:27.191 --> 00:21:29.830
strategy. By the second year of war in 1840,

392
00:21:30.010 --> 00:21:34.270
the women known as the widow Chang had died peacefully in her sleep at the

393
00:21:34.271 --> 00:21:35.350
height of our power Chang.

394
00:21:35.351 --> 00:21:39.340
She was a pirate queen who oversaw gambling and prostitution.

395
00:21:39.550 --> 00:21:42.730
She was in every sense of the word, a crime boss,

396
00:21:42.940 --> 00:21:47.140
but it is impossible not to admire how she reversed traditional gender roles and

397
00:21:47.380 --> 00:21:50.650
broke through a traditionally restricted female social mobility.

398
00:21:50.770 --> 00:21:51.910
She built her own career,

399
00:21:52.060 --> 00:21:56.500
her own ladder to success first by acting as the power behind Chang E and then

400
00:21:56.501 --> 00:21:59.140
by stepping into the power vacuum and assuming command.

401
00:21:59.320 --> 00:22:02.500
And then finally by negotiating the masterpiece of a deal,

402
00:22:02.501 --> 00:22:06.370
which ensured a quiet gilded life for her and our cohorts.

403
00:22:06.490 --> 00:22:08.110
And so we leave the last one.

404
00:22:08.250 --> 00:22:11.850
<v 2>Do you Chang, she lost a criminal or wrong.</v>

405
00:22:12.480 --> 00:22:14.340
