00:00:16.130 --> 00:00:19.010
Well, many gangsters have monuments built in their honor. However,

5
00:00:19.011 --> 00:00:21.980
if you were to travel to the Flamingo hotel in Las Vegas,

6
00:00:21.981 --> 00:00:24.230
you would find one dedicated to Bugsy Siegel.

7
00:00:24.350 --> 00:00:28.760
Siegel was a prominent member of the Jewish bald throughout the 1930s and 1940s.

8
00:00:28.790 --> 00:00:32.000
He was an ally of fellow Jewish gangster mayor landscape,

9
00:00:32.240 --> 00:00:36.770
and together they established close ties to the New York mafia governed by the

10
00:00:36.771 --> 00:00:38.840
commission, their criminal organizations,

11
00:00:38.841 --> 00:00:42.410
and several others were often grouped together as a loose Confederation,

12
00:00:42.411 --> 00:00:45.260
which the media dubbed the national crime syndicate.

13
00:00:45.350 --> 00:00:47.780
Many of the most violent actions over this Indigo,

14
00:00:47.810 --> 00:00:51.110
particularly mob hits often carried out by a ruthless group,

15
00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:53.780
which had been co-founded by Bugsy Siegel.

16
00:00:53.840 --> 00:00:57.740
The infamous murder incorporated Siegel ones admitted to a real estate

17
00:00:58.270 --> 00:01:00.200
developers that he killed over a dozen men.

18
00:01:00.290 --> 00:01:03.860
He had been involved in bootlegging during prohibition, then in gambling,

19
00:01:03.861 --> 00:01:06.290
extortion and prostitution, after it was repealed.

20
00:01:06.410 --> 00:01:10.460
And he had the legacy by which he is primarily remembered today has nothing to

21
00:01:10.461 --> 00:01:13.490
do with any of that. He is regarded as a smart businessman,

22
00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:17.630
even as a visionary by some who looked at a desert wasteland and saw the

23
00:01:17.631 --> 00:01:22.310
potential to turn it into one of the biggest gambling destinations in the world.

24
00:01:22.400 --> 00:01:26.630
Even today, Bugsy Siegel is often called the man who invented Las Vegas.

25
00:01:26.660 --> 00:01:29.810
Although as we'll soon, find out this name is not accurate,

26
00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:32.690
but even so Bugsy Siegel was undoubtedly.

27
00:01:32.720 --> 00:01:37.400
One of America's most notorious mobsters and has played a huge role in the

28
00:01:37.401 --> 00:01:38.600
history of sin.

29
00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:40.033
<v 1>City.</v>

30
00:01:45.380 --> 00:01:49.370
<v 0>Benjamin Siegel was born on February the 28th, 1906 in Brooklyn,</v>

31
00:01:49.400 --> 00:01:51.770
New York to max and Jenny Siegel,

32
00:01:51.771 --> 00:01:55.070
a pair of poor Jewish immigrants who came to America from Galicia,

33
00:01:55.280 --> 00:01:57.650
a region of the Austro-Hungarian empire,

34
00:01:57.651 --> 00:02:02.120
which is now part of Ukraine is nickname of Bugsy or bugs came later during his

35
00:02:02.121 --> 00:02:04.250
mobster years. But for the sake of consistency,

36
00:02:04.251 --> 00:02:05.990
we're going to call him up from the beginning.

37
00:02:06.080 --> 00:02:09.200
Allegedly other gangsters came up with this in reference to his quick and

38
00:02:09.201 --> 00:02:13.790
violent temper, because he was as crazy as a bedbug Siegel. However,

39
00:02:13.850 --> 00:02:17.900
hated the nickname likely because the mention of bedbugs reminded him of his

40
00:02:17.901 --> 00:02:19.850
poor childhood raised in squalor.

41
00:02:19.960 --> 00:02:22.010
And as most people who called him Bugsy to his face,

42
00:02:22.520 --> 00:02:26.480
risked finding out exactly how he earned the Monica. I'm surprisingly young.

43
00:02:26.720 --> 00:02:29.450
Ben wanted to escape his life of poverty as soon as possible.

44
00:02:29.451 --> 00:02:32.540
And like many other teenagers who resided in the poor,

45
00:02:32.541 --> 00:02:33.830
violent neighborhoods of Brooklyn,

46
00:02:33.980 --> 00:02:36.770
he saw crime as the quickest way of accomplishing his goal.

47
00:02:36.800 --> 00:02:40.970
By the time he was around 14 years old Bugsy already had a gang of hoodlums and

48
00:02:41.180 --> 00:02:45.170
even worked his first extortion racket. He would go up to push cough pedal.

49
00:02:45.171 --> 00:02:49.190
As you sold various trinkets out of that constant demands payment in exchange

50
00:02:49.191 --> 00:02:51.530
for his protection services. If they refused,

51
00:02:51.531 --> 00:02:55.160
he would douse that concent kerosene and threatened to light the whole thing on

52
00:02:55.161 --> 00:02:59.240
fire. It was around this time that Siegel started associating with other future

53
00:02:59.290 --> 00:03:02.500
notable mobsters. One of the guys in his gang was most segway.

54
00:03:02.501 --> 00:03:05.890
Who'd go on to become an important lieutenants in the Jewish Marvins would

55
00:03:05.891 --> 00:03:09.880
continue to look after the bulbs interests in Las Vegas off to Siegel's death.

56
00:03:09.940 --> 00:03:13.600
The bugs, his criminal career took a significant turn in 1918.

57
00:03:13.601 --> 00:03:17.020
When he met another tough Jewish thug named male landscape,

58
00:03:17.050 --> 00:03:19.030
the exact story of how the two became friends,

59
00:03:19.150 --> 00:03:21.130
it's never been established with certainty,

60
00:03:21.280 --> 00:03:24.520
but the popular version says that landscape saved Siegel's life.

61
00:03:24.580 --> 00:03:25.660
During a craps game,

62
00:03:25.810 --> 00:03:28.960
as landscape was coming home from school one day he's or a bunch of other people

63
00:03:28.961 --> 00:03:32.020
playing dice on a street corner with Siegel among them,

64
00:03:32.200 --> 00:03:36.250
I fight broke out and someone knocked Bugsy to the grounds and a pistol fell out

65
00:03:36.251 --> 00:03:36.940
of his coat.

66
00:03:36.940 --> 00:03:40.180
The other player picks up the gun aimed at Siegel and was getting ready to

67
00:03:40.181 --> 00:03:43.380
shoot, but Bensley jumps in and knocks the other going over.

68
00:03:43.510 --> 00:03:46.120
Right then the police whistles started ringing through the air.

69
00:03:46.121 --> 00:03:49.930
So everybody ran for the Hills Siegel and landscape got away together and became

70
00:03:49.960 --> 00:03:53.560
close friends. Soon afterwards, the two forms, the bugs and mare mob,

71
00:03:53.561 --> 00:03:57.130
which would go on to become the powerful force in new York's lower East side

72
00:03:57.580 --> 00:04:00.970
landscape was not known to be a particularly violent man and usually prefer to

73
00:04:00.971 --> 00:04:02.200
delegate the dirty work.

74
00:04:02.201 --> 00:04:06.100
So he was considered the brains of the operation while Siegel was the brawn.

75
00:04:06.250 --> 00:04:10.390
Initially the members of the mob United together to ensure a strong Jewish

76
00:04:10.420 --> 00:04:14.020
criminal front against the rise of Italian and Irish gangs. However,

77
00:04:14.021 --> 00:04:17.230
the landscape was not one to pass up good business opportunities.

78
00:04:17.231 --> 00:04:20.920
So his outfit soon started having dealings with Italian gangs,

79
00:04:20.921 --> 00:04:25.360
particularly that sort of an up and coming mobster named Charles lucky

80
00:04:25.630 --> 00:04:26.440
Luciano.

81
00:04:26.440 --> 00:04:30.070
Once prohibition came in and the bugs and man mob started making a lot of money

82
00:04:30.071 --> 00:04:30.970
from bootlegging.

83
00:04:30.971 --> 00:04:35.170
In addition to the traditional gambling car theft robbery and extortion rackets,

84
00:04:35.290 --> 00:04:38.980
the gang certainly did not shy away from murder either and developed a

85
00:04:38.981 --> 00:04:41.800
particularly ruthless and violent reputation. And in fact,

86
00:04:41.980 --> 00:04:45.040
the bugs and ma'am bulbs don't need to become the go-to source for murder,

87
00:04:45.041 --> 00:04:45.970
for hire services.

88
00:04:46.210 --> 00:04:50.050
And as such came to be regarded as the precursor to murder Inc.

89
00:04:56.610 --> 00:04:56.880
<v 1>Bugsy Siegel.</v>

90
00:04:56.880 --> 00:05:00.300
<v 0>I was rising through the ranks of America's criminal underground during a period</v>

91
00:05:00.600 --> 00:05:02.970
marked by tamale valance and shifting allegiances.

92
00:05:03.060 --> 00:05:06.330
There were lots of tough disputes, which led to a lot of bloodshed,

93
00:05:06.331 --> 00:05:09.900
which in turn created unwanted attention from the police and the media,

94
00:05:09.960 --> 00:05:13.590
and that didn't help anyone to try and resolve this prominent criminal figures

95
00:05:13.591 --> 00:05:14.700
from all over the country,

96
00:05:14.730 --> 00:05:17.790
gathered in one place to see if they could work things out.

97
00:05:17.850 --> 00:05:22.170
The Atlantic city conference held between may the 13th and the 16th, 1929,

98
00:05:22.171 --> 00:05:26.130
and hosted by Advantix city, political boss, enact Nikki Johnson.

99
00:05:26.131 --> 00:05:28.830
The man who served as the basis for Nikki Thompson,

100
00:05:28.831 --> 00:05:30.510
the main character from boardwalk empire.

101
00:05:30.720 --> 00:05:34.320
This was considered the first crime summit to take place in the United States.

102
00:05:34.321 --> 00:05:37.890
The first of only a handful that we know about every one of importance was in

103
00:05:37.891 --> 00:05:40.530
attendance. That was the Chicago outfit headed by Al Capone,

104
00:05:40.710 --> 00:05:41.850
the Jewish mob from Philly,

105
00:05:41.851 --> 00:05:45.240
the purple gang from Detroit representatives from Kansas city,

106
00:05:45.360 --> 00:05:50.280
Boston Cleveland's new Orleans unsurprisingly New York was the best represented

107
00:05:50.281 --> 00:05:54.420
region, not only where the lieutenants from all of the mafia families,

108
00:05:54.421 --> 00:05:58.670
but also the Irish mob, the New Jersey mob and the gang led by Dutch Schultz.

109
00:05:58.940 --> 00:06:01.490
Male landscape was one of the men who organized the whole thing.

110
00:06:01.491 --> 00:06:04.310
So of course he was there and he was accompanied by Bugsy.

111
00:06:04.311 --> 00:06:07.220
Siegel is represents their own bugs and may have mob.

112
00:06:07.310 --> 00:06:10.970
The general idea of being promoted at the conference was the gang violence was

113
00:06:10.971 --> 00:06:12.290
bad for business for everyone,

114
00:06:12.291 --> 00:06:15.830
but the attention mainly focused on two ongoing disputes.

115
00:06:15.860 --> 00:06:17.210
The first was one in Chicago.

116
00:06:17.420 --> 00:06:20.990
The infamous St Valentine's day massacre had only occurred a few months prior,

117
00:06:21.170 --> 00:06:24.770
and it brought more attention to organized crime than any previous events.

118
00:06:24.830 --> 00:06:28.430
There's part Al Capone said that he was willing to live and let live.

119
00:06:28.431 --> 00:06:29.480
Although of course,

120
00:06:29.481 --> 00:06:33.290
this was after he had already severely crippled his rival organization that was

121
00:06:33.291 --> 00:06:34.610
led by bugs Morin.

122
00:06:34.640 --> 00:06:38.630
The fact that nobody from Morin's outfit even attended the conference was very

123
00:06:38.631 --> 00:06:41.300
indicative of the current power dynamic in Chicago,

124
00:06:41.450 --> 00:06:45.740
suggesting that everyone realized that the city was Capones and any further

125
00:06:45.741 --> 00:06:47.990
serious tough disputes were unlikely.

126
00:06:48.110 --> 00:06:51.920
The same could not be said for New York city back then there were still the boss

127
00:06:51.921 --> 00:06:56.390
of all bosses who claimed dominion over all other mafia, families of the city.

128
00:06:56.420 --> 00:06:58.790
That was the way that it was done in the old country,

129
00:06:58.791 --> 00:07:00.580
but the time they were changing,

130
00:07:00.850 --> 00:07:04.300
those who attended the conference understood that the old ways could not work

131
00:07:04.301 --> 00:07:07.840
forever. And as long as one man would rule alone at the top,

132
00:07:08.020 --> 00:07:11.110
there would always be another one gun in for his head.

133
00:07:11.170 --> 00:07:15.280
This is in fact exactly what was going on New York at the time two men were

134
00:07:15.281 --> 00:07:17.710
vying for the position of boss of all bosses.

135
00:07:17.830 --> 00:07:20.710
One was [inaudible] known as Joe,

136
00:07:20.711 --> 00:07:23.170
the boss and the other was Salvatore Maranzano.

137
00:07:23.260 --> 00:07:25.720
And it was a conflict known as the customer, easy war,

138
00:07:25.780 --> 00:07:30.010
both miss Syria and Maranzano were considered mustache Petes,

139
00:07:30.040 --> 00:07:33.400
old school mobsters from Sicily who weren't interested in changes.

140
00:07:33.490 --> 00:07:36.400
Unsurprisingly, neither one attended the conference in Atlantic city,

141
00:07:36.580 --> 00:07:40.480
but the lieutenants did and they included men like lucky, new China,

142
00:07:40.600 --> 00:07:44.020
Frank Costello, Colorado Gambino, and Vieta Genevese.

143
00:07:44.150 --> 00:07:45.850
They were considered young Turks.

144
00:07:45.851 --> 00:07:49.840
It represented the new guards looking to reform the criminal hierarchy.

145
00:07:49.930 --> 00:07:52.720
The conclusion at the end of the conference was that the mustache Petes of the

146
00:07:52.721 --> 00:07:56.140
world had to die out before any significant change could happen.

147
00:07:56.290 --> 00:08:00.310
It started with miss Syria, Joe, the boss was gunned down on April the 15th,

148
00:08:00.320 --> 00:08:03.370
1931 betrayed by his own lieutenants, lucky to China,

149
00:08:03.520 --> 00:08:06.070
according to the common story for men short, miss Syria,

150
00:08:06.100 --> 00:08:09.520
as he was leaving a restaurants and among them was Bugsy Siegel, who,

151
00:08:09.521 --> 00:08:12.940
by this point, it's often worked as a hired gunman for Luciano.

152
00:08:12.970 --> 00:08:15.040
Some historians dispute this fashion of events,

153
00:08:15.041 --> 00:08:17.590
but we cannot say with certainty either way.

154
00:08:17.680 --> 00:08:21.220
We also can't positively say that Siegel took part in the assassination of

155
00:08:21.221 --> 00:08:24.430
Salvatore Maranzano, which occurred only a few months later,

156
00:08:24.460 --> 00:08:27.280
but he has been connected to that murder as well.

157
00:08:27.340 --> 00:08:31.600
Now that both Syria and Erin's were dead as a new China and his allies forms the

158
00:08:31.601 --> 00:08:34.600
commission, the governing body of the American mafia,

159
00:08:34.630 --> 00:08:37.720
which oversaw all of its criminal activities and was ruled by a board of

160
00:08:37.721 --> 00:08:39.460
directors instead of a single man,

161
00:08:39.490 --> 00:08:41.950
seven crime families originally had a seat on the board,

162
00:08:42.220 --> 00:08:46.510
the five from New York plus Capone's Chicago outfit and to the Buffalo crime

163
00:08:46.511 --> 00:08:50.470
family with everyone else being represented by one of the seven guys like Matt

164
00:08:50.471 --> 00:08:53.980
Lansky and Bugsy Siegel could not be a part of the official hierarchy

165
00:08:54.040 --> 00:08:56.580
established by the commission because they were not Italian,

166
00:08:56.670 --> 00:08:59.310
but they still held powerful positions as associates,

167
00:08:59.311 --> 00:09:01.170
especially given that close association.

168
00:09:01.290 --> 00:09:04.530
So lucky new Chano who served as the commission's first chairman.

169
00:09:04.680 --> 00:09:06.630
I mean say what you want about these mob guys,

170
00:09:06.631 --> 00:09:08.850
but they were often pretty well put together.

171
00:09:08.851 --> 00:09:11.010

00:09:20.760 --> 00:09:23.010
Now I don't shave my beard, but I do shave my head.

175
00:09:23.011 --> 00:09:27.480

executive. And then there's this kit that comes with it. There's the prep scrub.

180
00:09:43.740 --> 00:09:45.570
Um, basically you put this on before then.

181
00:09:45.571 --> 00:09:47.520
There's the shave butter which you use during,

182
00:09:47.521 --> 00:09:48.630
and then there's the post saved you,

183

which you used afterwards on the post-sale do you,

184
00:09:50.851 --> 00:09:54.030
because I got a little dry upstairs after I shaved.

185
00:09:54.390 --> 00:09:55.890
What's it like to slap some of that post tape?

186

<v 2>[Inaudible].</v>

194
00:10:23.660 --> 00:10:27.290
<v 0>With the formation of this new national crimes indicates the bugs. A man,</v>

195
00:10:27.291 --> 00:10:28.190
Bob disbanded,

196
00:10:28.340 --> 00:10:32.870
as both men assumed various positions within this new larger organization.

197
00:10:32.930 --> 00:10:36.500
Mayor Lansky worked as one of Luciano's closest associates and nuns of the

198
00:10:36.501 --> 00:10:38.220
nickname of the mobs accountant.

199
00:10:38.420 --> 00:10:41.600
Does he set up many profitable businesses for the mafia with prohibition on the

200
00:10:41.601 --> 00:10:45.980
way out, Bugsy also finds new avenues of revenue, but throughout the 1930s,

201
00:10:45.981 --> 00:10:48.440
his main occupation was still acting as a gunman.

202
00:10:48.620 --> 00:10:51.920
Whenever someone was making trouble for Lansky or Chano,

203
00:10:52.040 --> 00:10:55.790
he managed to evade legal troubles as except for one arrest for illegal gambling

204
00:10:55.791 --> 00:10:56.601
in 1932,

205
00:10:56.601 --> 00:11:01.250
which resulted in a small fine that Siegel paid on the spot from a thick roll of

206
00:11:01.251 --> 00:11:05.870
bills. This ended up being the only conviction in his entire criminal career,

207
00:11:06.050 --> 00:11:08.150
but just because he was saved from the law,

208
00:11:08.180 --> 00:11:12.050
did not mean that nobody was out to get him even with powerful backing Siegel

209
00:11:12.070 --> 00:11:14.000
still made a lot of murderers enemies.

210
00:11:14.210 --> 00:11:18.890
And in the late 1930s landscape decided that New York was becoming too dangerous

211
00:11:18.891 --> 00:11:19.340
for him.

212
00:11:19.340 --> 00:11:23.810
So he sent Segal to the West coast to help set up a new syndicate racket that in

213
00:11:23.811 --> 00:11:26.810
1937, Bugsy Siegel arrived in Los Angeles.

214
00:11:27.110 --> 00:11:30.080
There he met the boss of the Los Angeles crime family, Jack Dragnet,

215
00:11:30.320 --> 00:11:33.770
and the two forms, a fractious relationship, which is still unclear today.

216
00:11:34.190 --> 00:11:37.640
Siegel and drag now have often been described as bitter rivals who had to work

217
00:11:37.641 --> 00:11:38.474
together,

218
00:11:38.600 --> 00:11:42.500
dragging up a man once referred to as the Capone of Los Angeles was now forced

219
00:11:42.501 --> 00:11:45.290
to take a subservient role to the new guy from New York,

220
00:11:45.291 --> 00:11:49.250
because Siegel had the support of the commission. If this was indeed the case,

221
00:11:49.430 --> 00:11:52.790
it would be easy to see how Dragnet would grow to resent seagull.

222
00:11:52.820 --> 00:11:57.160
But historians have argued that the rivalry between the two has been exaggerated

223
00:11:57.190 --> 00:11:59.860
and that they cooperated enough to make a lot of money together.

224
00:12:00.040 --> 00:12:03.670
One person Dragnet definitely did not like was Mickey Cohen.

225
00:12:03.671 --> 00:12:07.360
Another gangster from New York who had been sent by landscape to help out Segal

226
00:12:07.720 --> 00:12:11.380
Cohen started off as a simple body yard and Rose through the ranks with his new

227
00:12:11.381 --> 00:12:14.950
detail in Los Angeles, being his big promotion, indeed ones,

228
00:12:14.951 --> 00:12:18.610
Bugsy Siegel was dead Dragnet trying to take out Cohen's several times and

229
00:12:18.611 --> 00:12:22.000
failed with Mikiko and eventually becoming the most powerful mobster in

230
00:12:22.001 --> 00:12:23.350
Hollywood back to boxy,

231
00:12:23.380 --> 00:12:26.800
he took an immediate liking to the glitz and glamor of Tinseltown and soon

232
00:12:26.801 --> 00:12:29.470
became a regular as all the lavish Hollywood parties.

233
00:12:29.500 --> 00:12:33.490
He had an introduction through a childhood friend act to George raft and Siegel

234
00:12:33.491 --> 00:12:37.240
was soon rubbing elbows with movie stars, musicians, directors,

235
00:12:37.241 --> 00:12:40.000
and big time studio executives. At this time,

236
00:12:40.001 --> 00:12:43.510
he also began an affair with a would be actress named Virginia Hill,

237
00:12:43.690 --> 00:12:46.420
which would last on and off until his death.

238
00:12:46.510 --> 00:12:51.370
This period in bug's life contained some of his more colorful adventures.

239
00:12:51.490 --> 00:12:55.620
For example, in 1938, he believed he came to possess a genuine treasure maps.

240
00:12:55.621 --> 00:12:59.050
So he chartered a sailboat, smuggled, some dynamize and vomited,

241
00:12:59.051 --> 00:13:02.440
a bunch of Hollywood friends and went off sailings to an Island off the coast of

242
00:13:02.441 --> 00:13:05.320
Costa Rica. A few days of digging and explosions followed,

243
00:13:05.350 --> 00:13:07.180
but there was no trash to be found.

244
00:13:07.270 --> 00:13:10.390
And even craziest story happens the following year when seagull trying to sell

245
00:13:10.391 --> 00:13:12.070
explosives to Benito Mussolini,

246
00:13:12.340 --> 00:13:15.910
this unlikely business opportunity came courtesy of one of Siegel's place,

247
00:13:15.911 --> 00:13:18.640
friends in Hollywood, or at JRS named counters,

248
00:13:18.641 --> 00:13:21.700
Dorothy to Frasso who owns a lavish filler in Italy.

249
00:13:21.790 --> 00:13:25.570
And it was an acquaintance of the dictator through her husband Bugsy and Dorothy

250
00:13:25.660 --> 00:13:28.510
had invested in a new type of explosive gold atomized.

251
00:13:28.511 --> 00:13:31.540
And she reasoned that muscly would make the perfect bar for us.

252
00:13:31.930 --> 00:13:33.760
Siegel took a trip to Italy in 1939,

253
00:13:33.761 --> 00:13:37.540
but the new venture turned out to be a Dada's muscly and he was unimpressed with

254
00:13:37.541 --> 00:13:39.970
the capabilities. And Artemide on that occasion.

255
00:13:40.000 --> 00:13:43.690
Bugsy allegedly also met hunting and gathering and disliked him so much that he

256
00:13:43.691 --> 00:13:47.020
wanted to shoot him. Bus was persuaded otherwise by the counts, as,

257
00:13:47.110 --> 00:13:49.240
as implausible as this whole story sounds,

258
00:13:49.241 --> 00:13:52.960
there is actually quite a lot of evidence to support the idea that Bugsy Siegel

259
00:13:53.290 --> 00:13:56.230
tried to sell out to Mike Dima. Salini the bond about Gehring however,

260
00:13:56.231 --> 00:14:00.460
is mostly just hearsay. These distractions made for entertaining stories,

261
00:14:00.461 --> 00:14:01.630
but for the most part,

262
00:14:01.690 --> 00:14:05.950
Bugsy stuck to what he was best at while he was in Los Angeles and he ran

263
00:14:05.951 --> 00:14:10.120
gambling operations, narcotics, prostitution rings, and extortion rackets.

264
00:14:10.180 --> 00:14:12.880
He still occasionally served as a gunman and in 1940,

265
00:14:12.881 --> 00:14:15.820
he was charged with the murder of fellow mobster, Harry Greenberg,

266
00:14:16.030 --> 00:14:17.290
AKA big greeny.

267
00:14:17.380 --> 00:14:20.260
Although this became the most serious crime that Siegel was ever charged with,

268
00:14:20.410 --> 00:14:23.110
ultimately he was not convicted due to insufficient evidence.

269
00:14:30.270 --> 00:14:31.770
Siegel was acquitted of Greenberg's murder.

270
00:14:31.920 --> 00:14:35.310
All the media attention surrounding his trial made Hollywood stars a bit more

271
00:14:35.311 --> 00:14:38.310
apprehensive about associating with the mobster power.

272
00:14:38.390 --> 00:14:42.390
This turned into the perfect opportunity for Siegel to look into a new business

273
00:14:42.391 --> 00:14:45.940
venture elsewhere. Gambling has always been a good moneymaker for him,

274
00:14:46.130 --> 00:14:49.980
and he went down to Nevada to acquire an interest in a racing publication called

275
00:14:50.790 --> 00:14:51.210
Trans-America.

276
00:14:51.210 --> 00:14:55.130
Why Siegel became increasingly engrossed with the idea of setting up a shop in

277
00:14:55.131 --> 00:14:58.910
Las Vegas and opening a luxury gambling result for the rich and famous.

278
00:14:58.970 --> 00:15:02.510
He saw firsthand that such establishments were doing very well because contrary

279
00:15:02.511 --> 00:15:06.620
to popular belief Siegel's hotel was not the first of its kind on the last Vegas

280
00:15:06.621 --> 00:15:10.310
strip, which back then was simply called highway 91. That's on,

281
00:15:10.311 --> 00:15:13.940
I belong to El Rancho Vegas, which opens in 1941,

282
00:15:14.000 --> 00:15:18.110
initially SQL purchase the El Cortez hotel and casino in 1945 for

283
00:15:18.111 --> 00:15:19.430
$600,000.

284
00:15:19.610 --> 00:15:24.110
The current newly renovated Cortez even has a restaurant called seagulls in 1941

285
00:15:24.111 --> 00:15:26.480
in honor of its notorious. One time owner.

286
00:15:26.540 --> 00:15:30.620
However Siegel found it problematic operating this hotel because local officials

287
00:15:30.621 --> 00:15:33.460
weren't too happy about working with a mobster. Instead,

288
00:15:33.800 --> 00:15:37.070
Bugsy looked for something outside of that purview since strictly speaking,

289
00:15:37.250 --> 00:15:40.520
the Vegas strip technically only includes the part of the Boulevard,

290
00:15:40.640 --> 00:15:45.170
which is outside city limits Siegel found exactly what he was looking for in the

291
00:15:45.171 --> 00:15:49.960
form of the Flamingo hotel being built outside Vegas by Billy Wilkerson,

292
00:15:49.980 --> 00:15:53.870
the Los Angeles nightclub owner and founder of the Hollywood reporter Wilkerson

293
00:15:53.900 --> 00:15:56.330
ran out of money for the project and needed a new funding.

294
00:15:56.331 --> 00:15:58.820
So he accepted Bugsy Siegel is a partner,

295
00:15:58.910 --> 00:16:02.660
whether or not he has an actual say in the matter is I'm certain, but well,

296
00:16:02.661 --> 00:16:05.930
cause then eventually sold all the stakes in the hotel before it was finished.

297
00:16:05.960 --> 00:16:08.840
The Flamingo was now owned by the mob Siegel,

298
00:16:08.841 --> 00:16:12.440
took over the building project and began acting his vision of a luxury resort.

299
00:16:12.650 --> 00:16:17.120
Most of the other Las Vegas hotels were all done in a dude ranch style,

300
00:16:17.121 --> 00:16:19.940
but this was not good enough for Bugsy who wanted something.

301
00:16:20.600 --> 00:16:24.080
Classier his hotel would have modern deco with a golf course and tennis courts

302
00:16:24.081 --> 00:16:26.360
and everybody would dress in formal wear,

303
00:16:26.510 --> 00:16:28.760
including the staff who would wear tuxedos.

304
00:16:28.820 --> 00:16:32.240
He convinced mayor Lansky and other high ranking mobsters that construction

305
00:16:32.241 --> 00:16:35.690
would cost between 1.2 and $1.5 million.

306
00:16:35.720 --> 00:16:39.590
But this was nowhere near the Mark. By the time the hotel was actually finished,

307
00:16:39.770 --> 00:16:43.160
construction costs had sought to over $6 million.

308
00:16:43.250 --> 00:16:46.790
Part of this was due to Siegel's poor management and financial skills positive.

309
00:16:46.960 --> 00:16:50.660
It was due to contract as taking advantage of his inexperience and Cunningham by

310
00:16:50.780 --> 00:16:54.020
charging double for the materials. Part of it may also have been due to Siegel,

311
00:16:54.021 --> 00:16:57.020
skimming off the top to pay for his own luxurious lifestyle.

312
00:16:57.230 --> 00:17:01.310
The Flamingo hotel had its grand opening on December the 26th, 1946.

313
00:17:01.510 --> 00:17:04.370
And it was a total disaster for starters, the casino was open,

314
00:17:04.380 --> 00:17:06.560
but the actual hotel was still under construction.

315
00:17:07.010 --> 00:17:09.800
Siegel was hoping to draw in a lot of the Hollywood crowns, Ghana,

316
00:17:09.830 --> 00:17:13.670
extra attention. He had the band's leader. Xavia Q GAT to provide music well,

317
00:17:13.790 --> 00:17:15.890
Jimmy Durante headline, the night's entertainment.

318
00:17:15.980 --> 00:17:18.530
Some of his Hollywood powers like George raft and Sony,

319
00:17:18.590 --> 00:17:22.610
Tufts were in attendance, but most slabs were kept away by heavy downfall.

320
00:17:22.730 --> 00:17:24.680
Most people who did venture inside the casino,

321
00:17:24.770 --> 00:17:28.400
he seemed to have a hot hand because they won big with no rooms available.

322
00:17:28.401 --> 00:17:30.830
They cashed out their winnings and went someplace else.

323
00:17:30.860 --> 00:17:34.880
Within one week of opening, the Flamingo lost another $300,000.

324
00:17:35.210 --> 00:17:38.600
This was really bad because Siegel had some knew that it was in hot water with a

325
00:17:38.601 --> 00:17:40.640
syndicate due to his extreme overspending.

326
00:17:40.820 --> 00:17:44.840
His only saving grace was that belief that he could make the Flamingo profitable

327
00:17:44.930 --> 00:17:46.250
and return their investments.

328
00:17:46.251 --> 00:17:49.890
But now it seems like that would not be the case with no other option.

329
00:17:50.040 --> 00:17:54.060
Bugsy closed down the hotel two weeks after the grand opening and waited for

330
00:17:54.061 --> 00:17:57.270
construction to finish. It was reopened on March the first, 1947.

331
00:17:57.300 --> 00:17:59.790
This time renamed to the fabulous Flamingo.

332
00:18:00.000 --> 00:18:02.280
It actually ended up turning a profit soon after,

333
00:18:02.460 --> 00:18:04.860
but even that was not enough to save Siegel,

334
00:18:11.810 --> 00:18:12.471
Bugsy Siegel.

335
00:18:12.471 --> 00:18:15.620
He was a hot topic of discussion among the mob bosses of the date in late

336
00:18:15.621 --> 00:18:16.810
December, 1946,

337
00:18:17.060 --> 00:18:20.900
another crime summit was held just like the one in Atlantic city. Back in 1929.

338
00:18:21.110 --> 00:18:23.300
This time it was held in Havana, Cuba.

339
00:18:23.301 --> 00:18:27.290
So lucky Luciano could attend as he had been deported to Italy earlier that

340
00:18:27.291 --> 00:18:29.330
year, the meeting itself took place on December.

341
00:18:29.331 --> 00:18:33.680
The 22nd at the hotel did Nasional to Cuba and over 20 bosses were in attendance

342
00:18:33.710 --> 00:18:36.680
among the subjects of discussion was the seagulls situation.

343
00:18:36.681 --> 00:18:40.910
As mayor Lansky put it Siegel had gone away of a budget on building the Flamingo

344
00:18:41.030 --> 00:18:43.970
after persuading, a lot of people to invest their money in it.

345
00:18:44.000 --> 00:18:47.240
Plus everyone was pretty sure that he was also stealing as his girlfriend,

346
00:18:47.241 --> 00:18:49.370
Virginia Hill made frequent trips to Switzerland.

347
00:18:49.760 --> 00:18:53.270
That was also concerned that Bugsy was preparing to flee the country of things

348
00:18:53.510 --> 00:18:57.350
done sideways. So ultimately it was decided that he had to go, however,

349
00:18:57.590 --> 00:19:01.070
male landscapers waited everyone to wait until the Flamingo opened to see how

350
00:19:01.071 --> 00:19:04.160
well it did. They agreed bots as we already discussed,

351
00:19:04.161 --> 00:19:08.030
the opening went terribly even so out of a sense of loyalty.

352
00:19:08.031 --> 00:19:11.330
If there is one time close friends landscape, trying to convince them again,

353
00:19:11.331 --> 00:19:14.900
to wait a few more months, to see if Segal could turn it around.

354
00:19:15.230 --> 00:19:19.250
But did he succeed on the night of June? The 20th of 1947,

355
00:19:19.251 --> 00:19:22.430
Bugsy Siegel was sitting in the living room of the Beverly Hills mansion that

356
00:19:22.431 --> 00:19:26.330
Virginia Hill reading the newspaper when he was shot multiple times with a 30

357
00:19:26.331 --> 00:19:29.690
caliber rifle by an unknown gunman Siegel was hit four times,

358
00:19:29.870 --> 00:19:31.940
three times in the head and twice in the chest,

359
00:19:32.120 --> 00:19:36.140
a popular story says that one bullet has been in the eye and execution dubbed

360
00:19:36.170 --> 00:19:40.160
the mode green special off to the character in the godfather who gets killed in

361
00:19:40.161 --> 00:19:44.330
the same way, a character who by the way was based on Bugsy Siegel. However,

362
00:19:44.331 --> 00:19:48.170
this wasn't exactly how it happened is the bullet did not actually hit Bugsy XY,

363
00:19:48.171 --> 00:19:51.050
but the force of the impact did cause it to pop out.

364
00:19:51.200 --> 00:19:55.550
So of course the big questions are who did it and why the most obvious answer is

365
00:19:55.551 --> 00:19:58.100
that it was a mob hit due to the mismanagement of the casino.

366
00:19:58.610 --> 00:20:01.880
Seagull made too many powerful enemies and landscape couldn't protect him.

367
00:20:01.881 --> 00:20:05.960
Forever. Many people are convinced. This is what happens. And for them,

368
00:20:06.110 --> 00:20:09.850
the only mystery is who pulled the trigger while this is more uncertain.

369
00:20:09.860 --> 00:20:13.970
The name most commonly brought up is Frankie Cabo, a gunman for motor rink.

370
00:20:14.000 --> 00:20:15.620
There are a couple of other theories though.

371
00:20:15.650 --> 00:20:19.700
One says that the shooter was one of Virginia Hills brothers taking revenge for

372
00:20:19.820 --> 00:20:23.510
the beatings that sequel gave his sister. Another idea involves a strange love.

373
00:20:23.511 --> 00:20:27.590
Triangle consisting of mobster moves segway, his wife B and her lover,

374
00:20:27.980 --> 00:20:32.570
moose Penza. And this story actually comes courtesy of B segue herself.

375
00:20:32.630 --> 00:20:34.730
We mentioned most that way at the start of this video,

376
00:20:34.790 --> 00:20:36.920
he was part of Siegel's teenage gang of criminals.

377
00:20:36.921 --> 00:20:38.360
So the two of them went way back,

378
00:20:38.450 --> 00:20:41.660
but that relationship soured heavily during the construction of the casino

379
00:20:42.320 --> 00:20:43.790
sideway was that to oversee seagull,

380
00:20:43.791 --> 00:20:46.340
spending something which Bugsy greatly resented.

381
00:20:46.490 --> 00:20:48.670
Eventually he had had enough and wanted mood debt.

382
00:20:48.790 --> 00:20:52.600
The latter found out about this and want his wife that something might happen to

383
00:20:52.601 --> 00:20:55.720
him, to which she replied that she would ask me to protect him.

384
00:20:55.870 --> 00:20:57.010
So according to be,

385
00:20:57.130 --> 00:21:01.600
it was moose Panzer that night who gunned down Bugsy Siegel in order to protect

386
00:21:01.601 --> 00:21:03.610
his love, his husband, some of Lansky's men,

387
00:21:03.670 --> 00:21:06.460
including most segway took over the operations of the Flamingo.

388
00:21:06.461 --> 00:21:09.520
The day after Siegel's death. As far as the mob was concerned,

389
00:21:09.700 --> 00:21:13.870
it was business as usual and its involvement with the Vegas casinos lasted for

390
00:21:13.871 --> 00:21:17.140
decades to come. And it became one of its most profitable dentures,

391
00:21:17.290 --> 00:21:18.123
Bugsy Siegel.

392
00:21:18.280 --> 00:21:21.490
Might've also been the man who invented Las Vegas as he is often called,

393
00:21:21.640 --> 00:21:26.500
but his legacy remains unique in the annals of crime and in comparable to that

394
00:21:26.740 --> 00:21:30.100
of any other gangster. So I really hope you found that video. Interesting.
