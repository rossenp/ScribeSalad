<v 0>Military theorists of basil Henry Ladelle hot one Slomin's is that</v>

2
00:00:04.591 --> 00:00:09.420
history too often glorifies those who are defeated in war while men may

3
00:00:09.421 --> 00:00:13.380
forget the victors while the Polian and Robert E. Lee are enshrined in drama,

4
00:00:13.560 --> 00:00:15.660
Wellington and grounds are almost forgotten.

5
00:00:15.750 --> 00:00:20.160
He wrote this may be true for today's protagonist, a brutal military strategist,

6
00:00:20.161 --> 00:00:21.240
who at a very young age,

7
00:00:21.270 --> 00:00:26.160
led Rome in a series of spectacular victories against the greatest threats ever

8
00:00:26.161 --> 00:00:29.010
faced by the Republic, Hannibal of Carthage.

9
00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:30.810
And while Hannibal is a household name,

10
00:00:30.811 --> 00:00:33.120
the life and merits of his chief Roman rival,

11
00:00:33.121 --> 00:00:37.350
maybe less than known in today's biographics we will learn about Publius

12
00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:38.041
Cornelius.

13
00:00:38.041 --> 00:00:42.870
Skipio known for his accomplishments as Afrikanas here's a general

14
00:00:42.900 --> 00:00:46.110
switch, the basil himself labeled as greater than the polio.

15
00:00:58.640 --> 00:00:59.180
<v 1>[Inaudible].</v>

16
00:00:59.180 --> 00:00:59.710
<v 0>Yes,</v>

17
00:00:59.710 --> 00:01:04.280
Cornelius Skipio was born in the year 235 BC to a powerful patrician

18
00:01:04.281 --> 00:01:05.630
family. His father,

19
00:01:05.660 --> 00:01:09.410
probably a senior was a well-respected political leader and military commander.

20
00:01:09.470 --> 00:01:12.770
The life of Pivotus Jr has been chronicled by several Latin and Greek

21
00:01:13.340 --> 00:01:15.590
biographies, Polybius and Livy among others.

22
00:01:15.620 --> 00:01:19.490
But these writers of the past have written very little about the childhood and

23
00:01:19.491 --> 00:01:21.380
early teens of our protagonist.

24
00:01:21.440 --> 00:01:25.940
We know that Publius may have been born versus area and section considered a

25
00:01:25.941 --> 00:01:28.400
sign of future greatness. Living even reports.

26
00:01:28.401 --> 00:01:31.670
The previous was conceived by his mother and to drawn sevens.

27
00:01:31.850 --> 00:01:34.070
The same story was told about on exams with the grade.

28
00:01:34.071 --> 00:01:38.030
So it may have been a common myth told about great generals from the boys early

29
00:01:38.031 --> 00:01:41.480
teens. We only have one disputed anecdote in this story,

30
00:01:41.481 --> 00:01:45.170
we learn of how probably a senior I had to drag a semi Andress Jr.

31
00:01:45.190 --> 00:01:47.330
From the bed chamber of an older lady,

32
00:01:47.331 --> 00:01:49.820
friends in just enough time to prevent a scandal.

33
00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:52.970
So was this a common occurrence was probably as junior,

34
00:01:52.971 --> 00:01:56.600
that son of the serpents, something of a precocious ladies,

35
00:01:56.601 --> 00:01:59.960
man chased around Rome by a prudish father. Well,

36
00:01:59.961 --> 00:02:04.010
the truth is we don't really know, but what's a great theatrical narrative.

37
00:02:04.040 --> 00:02:06.350
It would certainly make puberty as junior,

38
00:02:06.351 --> 00:02:11.000
as a spoiled aristocratic brat and troublemaker who slowly comes to accept his

39
00:02:11.001 --> 00:02:15.080
responsibilities toward his family and his motherlands in the time of need.

40
00:02:15.200 --> 00:02:18.890
And its time of need describes the catastrophe that threatened to destroy Rome.

41
00:02:19.160 --> 00:02:23.270
This was the invasion of Italy by the Carthaginian general Hannibal,

42
00:02:23.600 --> 00:02:28.100
at some points you may want to watch a biographics episode about who is foil

43
00:02:28.130 --> 00:02:30.590
Hannibal, but well, here are the basics.

44
00:02:30.950 --> 00:02:35.690
Roman Carthage had already 40 each other during the first Punic war from 264 to

45
00:02:36.620 --> 00:02:40.070
241 BC catheters forces were led by a handful of generals.

46
00:02:40.070 --> 00:02:43.370
One of whom was named Hammacher baka baka,

47
00:02:43.430 --> 00:02:47.780
meaning the Thunderbolt in the Phoenicia language spoken by the Carthaginians

48
00:02:47.840 --> 00:02:52.250
often more than two decades of fighting Carthage to Sue for peace yielding the

49
00:02:52.251 --> 00:02:55.640
Island of Sicily to Rome. One generation later in the year,

50
00:02:56.660 --> 00:02:59.500
219 call it the junior enforces in Spain. What led by Hannibal Barca,

51
00:02:59.501 --> 00:03:03.100
the son of Hammacher or the son of the Thunderbolt Hannibal and his forces had

52
00:03:03.101 --> 00:03:06.070
resumed hostilities and attacking Sagami zoom,

53
00:03:06.080 --> 00:03:10.120
a Spanish city allied with Rome that kicked off the second Punic war.

54
00:03:10.360 --> 00:03:14.200
Whereas most of the first conflict centered around Ireland combat and Naval

55
00:03:14.201 --> 00:03:17.230
battles. Hannibal surprised Rome by taking the fight. It's a,

56
00:03:17.440 --> 00:03:21.970
he made a wild gambit by leading his army of 26,000 men plus elephants over the

57
00:03:21.971 --> 00:03:26.230
snowy peaks of the Alps and into the Northern portion of the Italian peninsula.

58
00:03:26.440 --> 00:03:29.620
Hannibal was happy to take crazy calculated risks.

59
00:03:29.621 --> 00:03:33.100
He was hell bent on avenging cartridges, previous defeat,

60
00:03:33.101 --> 00:03:37.150
which had Solly the name of both his father and his country in short,

61
00:03:37.151 --> 00:03:38.100
he wanted revenge.

62
00:03:38.530 --> 00:03:42.880
He had the right combination of brains and brawn to get everything that he

63
00:03:42.881 --> 00:03:43.714
wanted.

64
00:03:49.290 --> 00:03:49.650
<v 1>[Inaudible].</v>

65
00:03:49.650 --> 00:03:54.270
<v 0>And 218 previous senior was one of the two consoles leading the Roman</v>

66
00:03:54.271 --> 00:03:57.150
Republic and probably his junior was barely 17.

67
00:03:57.330 --> 00:04:01.710
The oldest GPO was tasked by the Roman Senate to lead an army in Northern Italy,

68
00:04:01.740 --> 00:04:04.830
do oppose the incoming trips of Hannibal people. His junior,

69
00:04:04.831 --> 00:04:07.950
I followed his father and was put in command of a squadron of mounts and

70
00:04:07.951 --> 00:04:11.730
bodyguards. The two armies clashed in the battle of taking us river.

71
00:04:11.820 --> 00:04:15.810
According to Bolivia's probably a senior was surrounded by Carthaginian cavalry

72
00:04:15.840 --> 00:04:18.570
during the battle and seriously wounded, seeing this,

73
00:04:18.571 --> 00:04:22.050
his sons bird on his horse and charged alone into battle.

74
00:04:22.110 --> 00:04:24.180
The other cavalry men moved by his courage,

75
00:04:24.210 --> 00:04:27.150
followed him into the desperate attack, coal by surprise,

76
00:04:27.151 --> 00:04:30.660
the Carthaginians broke formation and fled people who are senior wounded,

77
00:04:30.661 --> 00:04:33.300
but still conscious hailed his son as his savior,

78
00:04:33.420 --> 00:04:37.080
the event cemented Skipio his reputation as a courageous leader,

79
00:04:37.140 --> 00:04:40.980
clearly Rome was in need of men like young Skipio as Hannibal soundly defeated

80
00:04:40.981 --> 00:04:45.350
the Romans on the ticket nurse and continued his March along the Italian boot,

81
00:04:45.510 --> 00:04:48.630
the brilliant general thrash the Romans of the battle of trivia river.

82
00:04:48.840 --> 00:04:49.673
And then again,

83
00:04:50.070 --> 00:04:53.310
asked Lake transom mean we don't have any evidence that the young Skipio

84
00:04:53.311 --> 00:04:56.220
participated in these battles. What can be speculated though,

85
00:04:56.221 --> 00:04:59.880
is that young Skipio may have listened carefully to the accounts of these

86
00:04:59.881 --> 00:05:04.290
defeats trying to learn what made Hannibal so lethal. Was it the elephants?

87
00:05:04.320 --> 00:05:06.480
Sure. Hannibal had a contingent of war elephants,

88
00:05:06.481 --> 00:05:09.420
which terrified and crushed the legions, or was it the cavalry?

89
00:05:09.450 --> 00:05:13.380
The Carthaginians were allies of the Midians a North African group who could

90
00:05:13.381 --> 00:05:15.420
boast some of the finest Calvary men of the time.

91
00:05:15.630 --> 00:05:17.700
Was it animal's neck to win new allies?

92
00:05:17.730 --> 00:05:21.570
General Barker was able to recruit numerous allies first among the Iberian

93
00:05:21.571 --> 00:05:25.860
tribes and then among the Celtic tribes in Northern Italy. Sure.

94
00:05:25.890 --> 00:05:26.611
It was all of these,

95
00:05:26.611 --> 00:05:30.360
but what made Hannibal a Victor was his brilliant tactical mind,

96
00:05:30.390 --> 00:05:34.710
which did not refrain from the use of stratagems trumps and ambushes to gain the

97
00:05:34.711 --> 00:05:35.850
upper hand and battle.

98
00:05:35.910 --> 00:05:39.450
On the other hand is the Roman Republic excelled in discipline and logistics,

99
00:05:39.451 --> 00:05:41.520
but lacked tactical creativity.

100
00:05:41.580 --> 00:05:45.120
They didn't even have a word for stratagems Romans considered them to be

101
00:05:45.121 --> 00:05:48.840
dishonorable that's who opposing concepts of warfare would be put to the test

102
00:05:48.870 --> 00:05:53.400
once more at the next big battle. On the 2nd of August, 216 BC,

103
00:05:53.401 --> 00:05:57.150
the Romans and Carthaginians faced each other near the town of Canadian modern

104
00:05:57.620 --> 00:06:02.540
Pulia the heel of the Italian boot had a fielded 40,000 foot and

105
00:06:02.600 --> 00:06:07.130
10,000 mounted soldiers. The Romans were led by two newly elected cortisols,

106
00:06:07.160 --> 00:06:10.760
Lucius Amelia's Paula's and Gaius Terentino's Varo.

107
00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:13.970
They're all made was stronger, consistent of 18,000 Legionnaires,

108
00:06:13.971 --> 00:06:18.320
but both the commanders and the troops lacked the experience of their opponents

109
00:06:18.470 --> 00:06:21.530
as can a Hannibal painted a masterpiece in Roman blood,

110
00:06:21.770 --> 00:06:25.850
a total and perfect and sacrament of the enemy army as it cost the Ginny in

111
00:06:25.851 --> 00:06:29.150
general placed his troops in a slightly convex formation rather than the

112
00:06:29.151 --> 00:06:31.580
traditional line is advanced troops at the center.

113
00:06:31.580 --> 00:06:35.570
First go to the room and sent it to advance. Then slowly withdrew as they did.

114
00:06:35.571 --> 00:06:39.410
So the wings of the formation surrounded the Roman legions from both sides,

115
00:06:39.560 --> 00:06:40.393
finally,

116
00:06:40.550 --> 00:06:44.150
animals cavalry attacked from the rear preventing any chance to run away.

117
00:06:44.360 --> 00:06:48.320
The trap closed as the youth of Rome was annihilated by the Carthaginian meat

118
00:06:48.740 --> 00:06:51.650
grinder. Many of the army leaders died including console immediacy,

119
00:06:51.680 --> 00:06:54.860
Polis 48,000 Legionnaires fell to their enemies.

120
00:06:55.160 --> 00:06:56.940
And that's the most conservative number.

121
00:06:57.020 --> 00:07:00.410
The mortality rate has been estimated to be 500 deaths per minute,

122
00:07:00.470 --> 00:07:01.850
and this will more than 90 minutes.

123
00:07:02.220 --> 00:07:06.230
Roman lost more men in battle than Canada did. And the whole of world war two,

124
00:07:06.350 --> 00:07:10.510
or almost as many men as the U S in 10 years of war in Vietnam.

125
00:07:10.750 --> 00:07:12.790
Puberty has Cornelius Skipio Jr.

126
00:07:12.970 --> 00:07:16.360
Was that as a 19 year old Tribune or junior officer,

127
00:07:16.420 --> 00:07:19.330
we don't have an account of what he did during the battle.

128
00:07:19.480 --> 00:07:23.470
We only know what he did afterward while the surviving Legionnaires and offices

129
00:07:23.471 --> 00:07:27.730
were in shock, confused as to what to do. Booby has displayed great leadership.

130
00:07:27.880 --> 00:07:31.780
The young officer rounded up a group of survivors and led them to safety past

131
00:07:31.781 --> 00:07:35.560
Hannibal's men, still looking for survivors monitoring in silence at night,

132
00:07:35.920 --> 00:07:39.220
always leading the way to look for the safest route. Previous letters,

133
00:07:39.221 --> 00:07:42.280
bands to the safety of kind of see him while on the run.

134
00:07:42.281 --> 00:07:45.520
People is interviewed as men trying to understand what had caused such a

135
00:07:45.521 --> 00:07:48.190
disaster. How could an army be crushed?

136
00:07:48.220 --> 00:07:50.560
So decisively by studying the battles,

137
00:07:50.561 --> 00:07:55.030
Skipio started to develop a admiration for Hannibal shore general barcode was

138
00:07:55.031 --> 00:07:59.620
his enemy, but poop. I would also consider him as his model, his master,

139
00:07:59.770 --> 00:08:04.690
and as we know, the destiny of every pupil is to one day, pass them all.

140
00:08:04.691 --> 00:08:07.360
Step off to the victory of Kenai Hannibal's army.

141
00:08:07.630 --> 00:08:11.170
Let's take the initiative to storm Ryan preferring to rest and Kapoor.

142
00:08:11.171 --> 00:08:12.880
30 kilometers North of Naples.

143
00:08:12.910 --> 00:08:16.900
Legend has it that the Senate sent a special force, a 300 dedicated Romans,

144
00:08:17.100 --> 00:08:19.930
just all their movements, not 300 Spartan hoplites,

145
00:08:19.960 --> 00:08:24.670
but 300 prostitutes whose sole job was to keep Hannibal soldiers busy,

146
00:08:24.760 --> 00:08:25.421
whatever the truth,

147
00:08:25.421 --> 00:08:28.810
the Carthaginian force did waste some time gallivanting and Capoeira.

148
00:08:29.020 --> 00:08:33.730
And later they occupied Southern Italy foraging on supplies and gradually

149
00:08:33.731 --> 00:08:35.380
gaining new regional allies.

150
00:08:35.890 --> 00:08:39.760
Hannibal may have had a long-term strategy to weaken Rome until he forced to

151
00:08:39.761 --> 00:08:40.420
surrender,

152
00:08:40.420 --> 00:08:44.510
but he had underestimated the strength of the bonds between the Roman Senate and

153
00:08:44.530 --> 00:08:47.080
the Roman people. This was a bond of trust,

154
00:08:47.081 --> 00:08:51.160
which not even at 500 deaths a minute could dissolve some allies may have

155
00:08:51.161 --> 00:08:52.540
switched sides. Sure,

156
00:08:52.541 --> 00:08:57.270
but others perpetuated that allegiance to Rome and room resistant.

157
00:08:57.480 --> 00:09:01.110
If we now zoom into the Senate, we may find Skipio junior. Again,

158
00:09:01.260 --> 00:09:05.280
it's 213 BC and Skipio is 22 years old since can.

159
00:09:05.570 --> 00:09:08.820
He had married a Mia daughter of Amelia's Polis,

160
00:09:08.850 --> 00:09:10.980
the console who had died in that battle.

161
00:09:11.010 --> 00:09:15.300
The couple later have three children previous the third Lucius and Cornelia,

162
00:09:15.720 --> 00:09:15.960
excuse me.

163
00:09:15.960 --> 00:09:20.010
His reputation for courage and leadership at accelerated is cost us on aura.

164
00:09:20.040 --> 00:09:23.040
The ladder of public officers needing to the console ship.

165
00:09:23.430 --> 00:09:26.550
People who are senior would have been proud of him that he'd been there while

166
00:09:26.551 --> 00:09:28.290
Hannibal had been plundering Southern Italy,

167
00:09:28.291 --> 00:09:30.210
the sentence that adopted a wise strategy,

168
00:09:30.211 --> 00:09:32.760
attack him to re-ask the Carthaginian allies in Spain.

169
00:09:32.761 --> 00:09:35.490
So we can them meant cut them off from supplies.

170
00:09:35.580 --> 00:09:39.720
The Senate had dispatched previous senior and his brother Nilus to take care of

171
00:09:39.721 --> 00:09:44.460
the Iberian tribes in 211 BC, a massive Iberian Carthaginian force a tank.

172
00:09:44.461 --> 00:09:47.700
The Romans on the bitus river, the Romans were repelled back.

173
00:09:47.730 --> 00:09:49.380
As far as Northeastern Spain,

174
00:09:49.440 --> 00:09:52.920
this defeat was compounded by a personal tragedy for Publius junior,

175
00:09:53.070 --> 00:09:56.910
both his father and his uncle had been killed in battle like his Carthaginian

176
00:09:56.911 --> 00:09:59.580
foil. The struggle had now become personal.

177
00:09:59.610 --> 00:10:01.620
The sending needed to appoint a new commander,

178
00:10:01.621 --> 00:10:04.830
a broader pro console to continue the campaign in Spain.

179
00:10:04.890 --> 00:10:09.270
Puberty has cornea Skipio barely 25 was elected almost unanimously to lead the

180
00:10:09.271 --> 00:10:13.350
expedition. Of course, he accepted to avenge Rome, his family,

181
00:10:13.710 --> 00:10:17.600
his father Skipio appointed Kayas Lelea as the second in command,

182
00:10:17.610 --> 00:10:20.460
a trusted right-hand man from Israelian military days,

183
00:10:20.610 --> 00:10:24.900
the to sell it off to terracotta modern day Tarragona to take charge of the

184
00:10:24.901 --> 00:10:25.980
surviving legions.

185
00:10:26.040 --> 00:10:29.070
The first act of the young general was to motivate those veterans,

186
00:10:29.071 --> 00:10:33.060
to do the unthinkable rather than entrenched themselves on the river Ebro,

187
00:10:33.150 --> 00:10:37.650
as they expected, they would attack their enemies in central and Southern Spain.

188
00:10:37.890 --> 00:10:41.040
As his armies crossed the river. Skipio revealed his true objective.

189
00:10:41.220 --> 00:10:44.940
The city on the Southeastern coast, the very Capitol of the enemy in Spain.

190
00:10:46.340 --> 00:10:47.173
<v 1>[Inaudible].</v>

191
00:10:52.920 --> 00:10:53.990
<v 0>The military theorists,</v>

192
00:10:54.290 --> 00:10:57.920
clean them AZELLA and his MacLaughlin have analyzed Skipio strategy from the

193
00:10:57.921 --> 00:11:00.860
perspective of the center of gravity battle theory,

194
00:11:00.861 --> 00:11:04.430
which goals for the identification and destruction of the true center of an

195
00:11:04.730 --> 00:11:08.510
enemy, armies strength or balance Hallowell center of gravity was the support he

196
00:11:08.511 --> 00:11:12.860
received from Spain and Spain center of gravity was new Carthage noon to be

197
00:11:12.861 --> 00:11:16.190
impregnable surrounded on three sides by the sea and lagoon.

198
00:11:16.220 --> 00:11:20.700
It could be besieged only by a narrow isthmus, but the crafty Skipio questions,

199
00:11:20.701 --> 00:11:23.480
some local fishermen who told him about the tides,

200
00:11:23.510 --> 00:11:25.460
which at specific times were so low,

201
00:11:25.461 --> 00:11:28.850
that one could walk across the lagoon exploiting this natural occurrence.

202
00:11:28.851 --> 00:11:30.470
Skipio announced to his soldiers,

203
00:11:30.471 --> 00:11:34.250
that he would part the waters with the help of Neptune God of the sea.

204
00:11:34.400 --> 00:11:38.120
And to the expected time the sea did withdraw from the lagoon that contingent

205
00:11:38.150 --> 00:11:41.840
rushed a new cartilage and storms, the poorly defended walls.

206
00:11:41.960 --> 00:11:44.960
After the victory yell out his troops to pillage and slaughter for a brief

207
00:11:44.990 --> 00:11:47.720
period. But then he imposed strict discipline.

208
00:11:47.780 --> 00:11:51.350
Some of the prisoners belonged to the same tribes that had killed his father,

209
00:11:51.380 --> 00:11:55.480
but he released them all. He went one step further offering artisans, sailors,

210
00:11:55.481 --> 00:11:59.680
and soldiers, a chance to join the ranks of the Romans. After this Congress,

211
00:11:59.710 --> 00:12:03.640
Skipio out to square off with the three Carthaginian generals and Iberia

212
00:12:04.150 --> 00:12:07.360
Hannibal's younger brothers have Struble and megas baka,

213
00:12:07.600 --> 00:12:11.860
and [inaudible] Hannibal's brother-in-law the next engagement with the enemy was

214
00:12:11.861 --> 00:12:16.720
the battle of Bay cooler, some 350 kilometers West of new Carthage and 208 BC.

215
00:12:17.320 --> 00:12:20.470
Skipio used a signature pencil tactic for the first time.

216
00:12:20.620 --> 00:12:23.230
He divided his main forces into two strong wings,

217
00:12:23.231 --> 00:12:27.580
which fell upon the Carthaginians flanks. After the victory Skipio showed again,

218
00:12:27.730 --> 00:12:29.530
his pension for long sighted clemency.

219
00:12:29.560 --> 00:12:33.430
When he learns that a new Midian horseman called MES Eva had been made prisoner.

220
00:12:33.610 --> 00:12:34.930
He ordered his release.

221
00:12:34.990 --> 00:12:39.730
The young soldier was a nephew of mass Anissa Prince at the Eastern new Midians

222
00:12:39.790 --> 00:12:41.530
who would later show his gratitude.

223
00:12:41.590 --> 00:12:45.610
The next big fight took place in 206 BC at a leper near modern day Seville.

224
00:12:45.630 --> 00:12:49.670
This was [inaudible] Shawn's to wipe the floor with Megace Barker and

225
00:12:50.760 --> 00:12:51.600
[inaudible] during this battle,

226
00:12:51.601 --> 00:12:54.930
Skipio took another step further away from the Roman tactical tradition.

227
00:12:55.050 --> 00:12:59.220
A typical order of battle would be to field the heavy Roman infantry at the

228
00:12:59.221 --> 00:13:02.810
center of a law nine flying Splunk lighter auxiliary force is provided by local.

229
00:13:02.880 --> 00:13:05.550
Yeah, the Carthaginians at a similar approach,

230
00:13:05.670 --> 00:13:09.780
but to deliberate Skipio did exactly the opposite is Liberian allies forms the

231
00:13:09.781 --> 00:13:13.500
center bearing the shock of the advance of heavily armed conflict Genia and

232
00:13:13.501 --> 00:13:17.880
foot. As the Iberian Solie was drew the well drilled Roman legions advanced in a

233
00:13:18.210 --> 00:13:18.660
pencil movement,

234
00:13:18.660 --> 00:13:23.100
crushing their opponents guesses and test rubles armies risked annihilation.

235
00:13:23.280 --> 00:13:26.040
If it wasn't for a violent and timely downfall,

236
00:13:26.130 --> 00:13:28.920
the Southern bad weather prevented the rooms from chasing their enemies.

237
00:13:29.040 --> 00:13:30.510
You managed to run for their lives.

238
00:13:30.720 --> 00:13:33.450
That must have been disappointed for Skipio nonetheless. It,

239
00:13:33.730 --> 00:13:36.990
it appeared as though the reigns of a Lipper had washed away the remnants of

240
00:13:37.020 --> 00:13:41.100
Carthaginian power in Spain history. Bulger's go fled back to Carthage. Well,

241
00:13:41.580 --> 00:13:44.190
Meg is baka. So refuge and the ballistic islands,

242
00:13:44.400 --> 00:13:48.570
their local allies had switched sides to Rome and Skipio had made some powerful

243
00:13:48.571 --> 00:13:49.380
new friends.

244
00:13:49.380 --> 00:13:54.090
Prince mass runs his legendary Numidian horseman at the young age of 29.

245
00:13:54.091 --> 00:13:58.530
General skier had subjugated and new province Hispania for the glory of Rome.

246
00:13:58.590 --> 00:14:00.840
But the fight was far from over in the same year.

247
00:14:01.020 --> 00:14:04.610
Ski made a quick trip to Northern Africa to test the loyalty of catheters.

248
00:14:04.710 --> 00:14:06.990
As allies in particular, the Western Indians,

249
00:14:07.170 --> 00:14:11.460
he learns that the King Syphax was tied into the Carthaginians by marriage.

250
00:14:11.520 --> 00:14:14.700
His wife, the beautiful Syphon ball was the daughter of

251
00:14:16.320 --> 00:14:17.190
[inaudible] friends. Messiness.

252
00:14:17.280 --> 00:14:20.760
There was the Prince of the Eastern Midians while both mass Anissa and Syphax

253
00:14:20.761 --> 00:14:22.860
had been fighting on the Carthaginian side.

254
00:14:22.890 --> 00:14:25.080
They were at odds with each other politically.

255
00:14:25.081 --> 00:14:29.160
They both vined for total leadership of the United Namibians on a more personal

256
00:14:29.161 --> 00:14:32.400
level. Massiveness has long been in love with Stephan,

257
00:14:33.030 --> 00:14:35.130
the newly out of his rival. During this trip,

258
00:14:35.160 --> 00:14:38.310
Skipio failed to turn the Western the Midians against Carthage,

259
00:14:38.340 --> 00:14:42.540
but he cemented the Alliance with mass Anissa boosting both numbers and the

260
00:14:42.541 --> 00:14:46.440
quality of his cavalry. Excuse me. As next trip was back home, back to Rome,

261
00:14:46.470 --> 00:14:49.560
he received a hero's welcome. And in 205 BC,

262
00:14:49.800 --> 00:14:54.260
he won the console ship aged only 30 Skipio wanted to continue leading the war

263
00:14:54.261 --> 00:14:57.170
against Hannibal who was still holding on to Southern Italy.

264
00:14:57.230 --> 00:14:59.000
He was presented with two options,

265
00:14:59.030 --> 00:15:02.720
either confront Hannibal head on initially with the risk of a second disaster,

266
00:15:02.721 --> 00:15:07.340
like Kenai or continue with the delaying tactics imposed by Quintus fabulous

267
00:15:07.341 --> 00:15:08.750
Maximus nicknames.

268
00:15:08.780 --> 00:15:12.530
The delayer Maximus was the senior most Senator who for years,

269
00:15:12.650 --> 00:15:16.520
it supported the strategy of harassing Hannibal's army to wear them down without

270
00:15:16.700 --> 00:15:19.370
giving into a full-on battle. Skipio chose.

271
00:15:19.520 --> 00:15:23.720
None of the above his strategy was to set up a base of operations in Sicily and

272
00:15:23.721 --> 00:15:26.090
use it as a launching pad for the invasion of Africa,

273
00:15:26.180 --> 00:15:29.270
a direct fight against her Hannibal was still too dangerous,

274
00:15:29.480 --> 00:15:32.990
but he could destroy him by targeting another center of gravity.

275
00:15:33.110 --> 00:15:36.680
Skipio had already taken out the center that had been providing Hannibal with

276
00:15:36.800 --> 00:15:41.300
recruits and supplies in Spain. Now he would target the center of his house.

277
00:15:42.040 --> 00:15:43.210
<v 2>Authority, Carthage.</v>

278
00:15:49.390 --> 00:15:53.260
<v 0>The Roman Senate influenced by Maximus opposed this command and conquer</v>

279
00:15:53.261 --> 00:15:57.130
strategy. It was too expensive and too risky historian.

280
00:15:57.131 --> 00:16:01.690
Giovanni Brizzy also suggests that the family of the layout may have had trade

281
00:16:01.750 --> 00:16:04.060
ties with the Carthaginian senators.

282
00:16:04.270 --> 00:16:08.410
It was not in their interest to threaten the wealth of their trade partners.

283
00:16:08.500 --> 00:16:11.290
Eventually Skipio wins. The Senate reached a compromise.

284
00:16:11.440 --> 00:16:13.600
He had permission to carry out his plan,

285
00:16:13.750 --> 00:16:17.140
but he could not raise fresh legions for his African landing.

286
00:16:17.470 --> 00:16:20.110
All Skipio received with the survivors of canape.

287
00:16:20.230 --> 00:16:24.280
These soldiers were the republics rejects, defeated and demoralized,

288
00:16:24.281 --> 00:16:28.840
humiliated and mistrusted by their own compatriots accused of cowardice and

289
00:16:28.841 --> 00:16:29.674
desertion.

290
00:16:29.740 --> 00:16:33.550
These two Meagan agents had been refreshed with elements from disciplinary

291
00:16:33.551 --> 00:16:37.480
units, soldiers, guilty of insubordination theft and other crimes.

292
00:16:37.660 --> 00:16:39.970
But the young general would not allow himself to fail.

293
00:16:40.030 --> 00:16:43.660
He drilled into shape his dirty dozen or dirty 10 thousands,

294
00:16:43.661 --> 00:16:46.720
and then launched an appeal to the attack allies.

295
00:16:46.780 --> 00:16:50.590
The allies responded to his calls, sending money, food, weapons, raw material,

296
00:16:50.600 --> 00:16:54.220
to build new ships and even hundreds of fully kitted out soldiers.

297
00:16:54.340 --> 00:16:55.930
Before heading off to Northern Africa,

298
00:16:55.970 --> 00:16:59.080
Skipio put his troops to the test in the invasion of lock rape.

299
00:16:59.110 --> 00:17:01.840
The Southern Italian town had highlighted itself to Hannibal,

300
00:17:01.841 --> 00:17:05.500
but Skipio spies informed him, but the tide was turning. The general,

301
00:17:05.501 --> 00:17:07.390
took the occasion to send a landing party,

302
00:17:07.391 --> 00:17:11.140
which promptly storms the town and surprise night attack chasing away the

303
00:17:11.141 --> 00:17:12.370
Carthaginian Garrison.

304
00:17:12.400 --> 00:17:15.970
This victory risked ruining all of Scorpios Grant's plans.

305
00:17:16.000 --> 00:17:19.810
The three officers left in charge at lottery proved to be a gang of crooks.

306
00:17:19.840 --> 00:17:23.920
They terrorized the local population and even desecrated the temple of the main

307
00:17:23.921 --> 00:17:28.450
data. The goddess pro subpoena Maximus took the occasion to cry scandal.

308
00:17:28.600 --> 00:17:31.900
He asked for mosquitoes returned to Romans for a commission of inquiry to

309
00:17:31.901 --> 00:17:33.940
investigate the events of lottery. Luckily,

310
00:17:33.941 --> 00:17:38.050
the general soon had some friends in the Senate and they snuck a cousin of his,

311
00:17:38.051 --> 00:17:41.950
into the commission to act in his stead. The trick works as the final report,

312
00:17:41.951 --> 00:17:45.640
exonerated Skipio from any wrongdoing where the internal opposition taking care

313
00:17:45.641 --> 00:17:49.030
of Skipio was now free to launch his invasion. In the summer of 204,

314
00:17:49.500 --> 00:17:53.850
he set sail from Sicily leading an army of 23,500 foot and

315
00:17:53.880 --> 00:17:57.480
2,500 cavalryman. In other words, 26,000 men,

316
00:17:57.510 --> 00:18:01.500
the same number that Hannibal had led into Italy years before near coincidence,

317
00:18:01.501 --> 00:18:03.090
or maybe Skipio was once again,

318
00:18:03.091 --> 00:18:07.620
proving that he could study emulate and eventually best his enemy Skipio and his

319
00:18:07.621 --> 00:18:10.080
army reached the first objective in Northern Africa.

320
00:18:10.110 --> 00:18:13.260
The city of Vertica on the coast of what is today, Tunisia,

321
00:18:13.290 --> 00:18:15.600
the Romans were seen besieged by two armies.

322
00:18:15.640 --> 00:18:19.770
The Namibians led by Syphax and Carthaginian mercenaries under how Struble

323
00:18:19.771 --> 00:18:23.130
Giscard exploiting his previous acquaintance with the Numidian King.

324
00:18:23.610 --> 00:18:25.950
Skipio sent ambassadors to discuss a peace settlement.

325
00:18:25.980 --> 00:18:27.450
This may have been against character,

326
00:18:27.480 --> 00:18:30.630
but Skipio could recognize when he was in a difficult spot.

327
00:18:30.690 --> 00:18:35.190
The talks continued until the beginning of 203 BC when Syphax and Skipio reached

328
00:18:35.191 --> 00:18:36.024
a compromise,

329
00:18:36.030 --> 00:18:39.990
Rome would retain control of Sicily and Sardinia while Carthage would rule over

330
00:18:39.991 --> 00:18:43.890
the remaining islands of the Western Mediterranean King side effects relished

331
00:18:43.891 --> 00:18:47.910
his diplomatic skills. One night in March, he prepared to relax in his lodging,

332
00:18:47.920 --> 00:18:51.960
surrounded by us from middle Alami that spent months inside of a makeshift camp

333
00:18:52.080 --> 00:18:55.080
of wooden barracks. But the war was finally coming to an end,

334
00:18:55.230 --> 00:19:00.000
a cry disturbed his peace as a cool spread wild among the centuries PLA

335
00:19:00.150 --> 00:19:01.110
in a matter of minutes,

336
00:19:01.140 --> 00:19:05.250
nearly the entire nymity in camp was ablaze with furious flames, consuming,

337
00:19:05.251 --> 00:19:08.370
the tents and cabins made of twigs and dry branches.

338
00:19:08.520 --> 00:19:12.930
The soldiers drive to escape the Inferno only to be quickly cut down by devils

339
00:19:12.931 --> 00:19:17.280
hiding in the dock. Messiness is Holsman and ski BEOS band of rejects.

340
00:19:17.640 --> 00:19:21.030
What just happens while conducting talks with cyphass Skipio who had sent some

341
00:19:21.031 --> 00:19:24.210
of his offices to the enemy camp to size as messengers, all sevens,

342
00:19:24.240 --> 00:19:27.000
the officers spied on the new Midians taking note of the centuries,

343
00:19:27.150 --> 00:19:27.631
their shifts,

344
00:19:27.631 --> 00:19:31.620
and especially on the flammable nature of the camp off the side effects of load

345
00:19:31.621 --> 00:19:34.680
is God Skipio that sent his two most trusted deputies.

346
00:19:34.740 --> 00:19:38.550
Massiveness are in Kaya's lay-leaders is to set the camp on fire while the

347
00:19:38.900 --> 00:19:42.300
Numidian army was slaughtered at detachment left from the nearby Ford of house

348
00:19:42.810 --> 00:19:46.020
dribble justice Skipio would plans the cultive Jeanine's work coming to help

349
00:19:46.021 --> 00:19:49.020
their allies and just escape. You had plans gives, goes,

350
00:19:49.021 --> 00:19:53.400
forces were ambushed and massacred on the way that out of the flames of Vertica

351
00:19:53.970 --> 00:19:55.530
Scorpios rejects image triumphant,

352
00:19:55.590 --> 00:19:58.560
this was their first big victory in enemy territory,

353
00:19:58.590 --> 00:20:00.810
but something also emerged from the ashes,

354
00:20:00.900 --> 00:20:04.470
a new style of warfare previously inconceivable to the Romans,

355
00:20:04.680 --> 00:20:09.360
a tactical doctrine founded on strategy, ENS, ambushes, and traps.

356
00:20:09.480 --> 00:20:12.450
It was yet another lesson learned from Hannibal. Some of the Thunderbolt,

357
00:20:12.660 --> 00:20:17.340
one at Skipio son of the serpent could not wait to turn against his master.

358
00:20:23.570 --> 00:20:24.230
<v 1>[Inaudible].</v>

359
00:20:24.230 --> 00:20:27.140
<v 0>Dribble and side effects managed to escape or to cope with support from his own</v>

360
00:20:27.141 --> 00:20:29.870
Senate general guests go raised another mercenary army.

361
00:20:29.900 --> 00:20:34.640
These new units blocked the weight Carthage by holding positions on the fields

362
00:20:34.641 --> 00:20:37.010
along the river, but gratis Skipio marched.

363
00:20:37.580 --> 00:20:39.980
Head-on ready to meet the enemy and a pitched battle.

364
00:20:40.010 --> 00:20:43.970
Skipio ordered his men to take the most traditional formation of the Republican

365
00:20:43.971 --> 00:20:47.770
times three lines of infantry protected by two wings cavalry.

366
00:20:47.800 --> 00:20:52.090
The first line weather has starty young and fit soldiers to carry out the first

367
00:20:52.091 --> 00:20:56.050
clash with the enemy. The second line where the Principia is older Legionnaires,

368
00:20:56.140 --> 00:20:57.280
finally, the tree Ari,

369
00:20:57.281 --> 00:21:01.150
the reserve of battle-hardened veterans who would join the fray at the time of

370
00:21:01.151 --> 00:21:02.140
need, uh,

371
00:21:02.200 --> 00:21:05.710
started his battle by launching his Calvary into action with a lady is on the

372
00:21:05.711 --> 00:21:08.770
rise of mass or on the left. So they challenged at discos horseman.

373
00:21:08.830 --> 00:21:11.980
The attack was successful in the conflict unions, retreated, alias,

374
00:21:11.981 --> 00:21:15.250
and mass Inessa continued to chase. And when the dust settles,

375
00:21:15.251 --> 00:21:19.360
the flanks of disco's infantry were completely exposed and it was time to crush

376
00:21:19.361 --> 00:21:19.810
them.

377
00:21:19.810 --> 00:21:23.890
The Prince of bees and [inaudible] would normally fight in long compacts lines,

378
00:21:23.891 --> 00:21:25.930
supporting the starti. But now scape,

379
00:21:25.931 --> 00:21:28.840
you had split them into smaller agile mandibles this way.

380
00:21:28.841 --> 00:21:30.760
They carry downs and enveloping maneuver,

381
00:21:30.790 --> 00:21:32.980
squeezing the enemies and a giant Pensa scape.

382
00:21:32.981 --> 00:21:37.270
You had evolved animals in circumvent tactic and to one that was much deadlier

383
00:21:37.450 --> 00:21:41.370
and quicker to execute. Another Carthaginian army had been destroyed. This time,

384
00:21:41.680 --> 00:21:43.930
guests go inside, thanks had fallen, captive nothing,

385
00:21:44.080 --> 00:21:46.150
and nobody stood in the way of Carthage.

386
00:21:46.210 --> 00:21:49.150
There was nothing left to do for its Senate,

387
00:21:49.240 --> 00:21:53.890
but start another round of peace talks during the winter of 203 and 200 and TBC

388
00:21:54.010 --> 00:21:58.030
Skipio imposed conditions that respected the integrity and sovereignty of

389
00:21:58.180 --> 00:22:00.250
Carthage and its African territories.

390
00:22:00.280 --> 00:22:04.930
The Carthage had to recognize mass Anissa as the sole King of the United

391
00:22:05.590 --> 00:22:05.650
Namibians,

392
00:22:05.650 --> 00:22:09.760
the city out to withdraw its troops from Italy and abandon any plans returned to

393
00:22:09.761 --> 00:22:10.210
Spain.

394
00:22:10.210 --> 00:22:14.560
The Carthaginian Senate was also forced to disband the Naval fleet and mercenary

395
00:22:14.561 --> 00:22:18.340
forces and to pay an immense sum of 5,000 silver talents to Rome.

396
00:22:24.540 --> 00:22:24.900
<v 1>[Inaudible].</v>

397
00:22:24.900 --> 00:22:28.080
<v 0>Peace negotiated with Carthage proved to be short-lived the shipment of food</v>

398
00:22:28.081 --> 00:22:29.670
supplies intended for the Roman army.

399
00:22:29.720 --> 00:22:34.080
It was blown off course by strong winds and the triremes were beach Carthage,

400
00:22:34.440 --> 00:22:34.981
hungry citizens,

401
00:22:34.981 --> 00:22:38.700
plundered the ships and refuse to return that loot Skipio took the occasion to

402
00:22:38.701 --> 00:22:41.790
resume hostilities devastating the farmlands around Carthage.

403
00:22:41.820 --> 00:22:45.600
Was he just looking for an excuse to continue the fights until Hannibal showed

404
00:22:45.601 --> 00:22:46.141
up? Well,

405
00:22:46.141 --> 00:22:50.070
this latest action did cause Hannibal to return before Skipio could strike at

406
00:22:50.071 --> 00:22:50.904
Carthage.

407
00:22:51.120 --> 00:22:55.260
Annabelle blocked his path by establishing a camp in Zana Hannibal's remaining

408
00:22:55.261 --> 00:22:58.290
army matched the Romans in strength at about 40,000 troops.

409
00:22:58.320 --> 00:23:01.640
Plus he had the elephants, you had less coverage DPO,

410
00:23:01.770 --> 00:23:03.390
and then realized perhaps too late,

411
00:23:03.600 --> 00:23:06.000
that Zimmer was not well supplied with fresh water.

412
00:23:06.480 --> 00:23:09.420
Annabel could not endure a long standoff and he needed a way out.

413
00:23:09.540 --> 00:23:13.200
His first initiative was to ask for a meeting with Skipio to perhaps negotiate a

414
00:23:13.680 --> 00:23:16.170
truce or resume talks for a definitive piece.

415
00:23:16.230 --> 00:23:18.420
We don't have an exact record of their meeting.

416
00:23:18.450 --> 00:23:21.630
What we do know is that the two greatest generals of their age showed the

417
00:23:21.631 --> 00:23:26.160
deepest respect to each other. Perhaps Skipio was all struck by the old arrival.

418
00:23:26.161 --> 00:23:30.270
And perhaps Hannibal was amused to meet a younger foe who clearly considered him

419
00:23:30.300 --> 00:23:32.970
to be a master. When Hannibal trying to propose the truce,

420
00:23:33.000 --> 00:23:36.810
however Skipio was unmoved. He replied you fail to endure peace.

421
00:23:36.990 --> 00:23:41.280
You must now prepare for war on October, the 19th, 202 BC,

422
00:23:41.281 --> 00:23:44.400
the serpents and the funds have all faced each other at Zimmer.

423
00:23:44.430 --> 00:23:48.710
The battle that would end it all one way or the other Scioto arranged as men in

424
00:23:48.711 --> 00:23:49.380
columns,

425
00:23:49.380 --> 00:23:53.960
leaving wide corridors between the manacles and the gaps were covered by a line

426
00:23:53.961 --> 00:23:57.200
of light infantry. Hannibal had placed his war, elephants at the front,

427
00:23:57.201 --> 00:24:00.530
since he started the battle by unleashing them on the Romans.

428
00:24:00.590 --> 00:24:02.480
This is exactly what Skipio expected.

429
00:24:02.660 --> 00:24:06.590
He ordered his front lines to bang their drums and blew their trumpets as loud

430
00:24:06.591 --> 00:24:09.800
as they could producing such noise that frightens the elephants,

431
00:24:09.801 --> 00:24:13.610
that stampeded back to the Carthaginians decimated in that front lines.

432
00:24:13.640 --> 00:24:15.680
Some elephants continued their forward charge.

433
00:24:15.710 --> 00:24:18.560
This is when Scorpio's light inventory moved out of the way,

434
00:24:18.561 --> 00:24:20.450
revealing the gaps between the mandibles.

435
00:24:20.630 --> 00:24:23.030
The elephants continue to charge along the corridors,

436
00:24:23.031 --> 00:24:25.760
doing this all damage and eventually leaving the battle.

437
00:24:25.910 --> 00:24:27.440
Now Skipio took the initiative,

438
00:24:27.500 --> 00:24:32.330
the audit [inaudible] and cause Linnaeus to attack the Carthaginian horseman,

439
00:24:32.360 --> 00:24:33.770
protecting Hannibal's flanks,

440
00:24:33.920 --> 00:24:37.880
the Romans and Midians since the better cavalry ans were able to chase off their

441
00:24:37.881 --> 00:24:39.080
opponents. Finally,

442
00:24:39.081 --> 00:24:43.520
it was time for Skipio to unleashes Pensa and surround Hannibal the Roman

443
00:24:43.521 --> 00:24:46.910
seconds and third lines of inventory moved it out to the sides,

444
00:24:46.911 --> 00:24:49.850
ready to suffocate the Carthaginians with a mortal embrace.

445
00:24:49.970 --> 00:24:54.350
But Hannibal that heard about the battle that the gratis and knew what to expect

446
00:24:54.440 --> 00:24:56.300
as the Romans tried to move around their enemy.

447
00:24:56.301 --> 00:24:59.630
The Carthaginians spread out in a long line, preventing them sacrament.

448
00:24:59.690 --> 00:25:03.470
This was the perfect countermove. Now it was just a long line of Roman infantry,

449
00:25:03.500 --> 00:25:07.580
opposite along line of Carthaginians and allies with covering out the picture of

450
00:25:08.150 --> 00:25:11.150
scapegoats. Infantry were outnumbered and could have quickly broken ranks,

451
00:25:11.360 --> 00:25:15.170
but they didn't. Those Legionnaires were the veterans of Kenai,

452
00:25:15.260 --> 00:25:17.960
the former reject stunned heroes at the Republic.

453
00:25:18.080 --> 00:25:22.160
This was their occasion to avenge their defeat and they would not back down.

454
00:25:22.430 --> 00:25:25.070
Eventually the Carthaginians started to news cohesion,

455
00:25:25.250 --> 00:25:29.510
some messenger units try to retreat fighting their own allies to shove them out

456
00:25:29.511 --> 00:25:32.450
of the way. But the final blow came from mass Nyssa,

457
00:25:32.700 --> 00:25:34.970
an alias like an easterly winds.

458
00:25:34.971 --> 00:25:39.470
The cavalry's gallops back to the Malai striking the Carthaginians from

459
00:25:39.471 --> 00:25:41.270
behind Annabel managed to escape.

460
00:25:41.271 --> 00:25:43.970
But on that day he left 20,000 of his men on the grounds,

461
00:25:43.971 --> 00:25:48.050
along with any remaining hope of saving Carthage Rome, and Skipio.

462
00:25:48.310 --> 00:25:49.143
<v 1>I'd won the war.</v>

463
00:25:56.200 --> 00:25:59.830
<v 0>Leah Skipio returns a room in triumph. He was now addressed as Afrikaners.</v>

464
00:25:59.831 --> 00:26:02.050
Thanks to his splendid victories, Northern Africa.

465
00:26:02.080 --> 00:26:04.390
Skipio negotiated a very good peace deal for Rome.

466
00:26:04.450 --> 00:26:06.790
Carthage retained its possessions in Africa,

467
00:26:06.970 --> 00:26:09.220
but it became a client state of the Roman Republic.

468
00:26:09.250 --> 00:26:13.180
Carthage would also pan indemnity of 10,000 silver talents, renounce orbit,

469
00:26:13.360 --> 00:26:17.500
10 of its Naval vessels and all of its war elephants. During his campaign,

470
00:26:17.950 --> 00:26:20.380
Skipio had also won a new ally to Rome, new media.

471
00:26:20.440 --> 00:26:22.480
It also conquered a whole new province.

472
00:26:22.481 --> 00:26:26.110
Hispania the first Roman controlled territory outside of Italy.

473
00:26:26.200 --> 00:26:29.470
Skipio was young, powerful, influential, and wealthy.

474
00:26:29.710 --> 00:26:33.430
His agents loved him to the point of swearing allegiance to him rather than

475
00:26:33.431 --> 00:26:34.030
Rome.

476
00:26:34.030 --> 00:26:37.960
This aroused the suspicion of the Senate to the more conservative senators.

477
00:26:37.961 --> 00:26:39.370
This man was dangerous.

478
00:26:39.670 --> 00:26:43.030
What could prevent him from declaring himself King and returning to the days of

479
00:26:43.140 --> 00:26:43.950
Roman monarchy.

480
00:26:43.950 --> 00:26:48.090
Rome was a Republic and she intended to remain one the occasion to strike it.

481
00:26:48.630 --> 00:26:52.770
Skipio came some years later in 194 BC King and Yonkers.

482
00:26:52.790 --> 00:26:55.680
Third of Syria was threatening the Greek city States,

483
00:26:55.710 --> 00:26:57.810
which at the time were under room's protection.

484
00:26:57.870 --> 00:27:02.010
His chief military advisor was none other than Hannibal Skipio at the time was

485
00:27:02.011 --> 00:27:05.790
strongly opposed by his most vocal political rival Marcus pokey,

486
00:27:05.791 --> 00:27:08.250
as Carto better known as Carter, the older,

487
00:27:08.310 --> 00:27:10.170
but the presence of Hannibal in Syria,

488
00:27:10.800 --> 00:27:14.010
alums enough of the Senate to allow for Skipio to retake the position of

489
00:27:14.011 --> 00:27:15.100
console. Once again,

490
00:27:15.240 --> 00:27:17.610
let's give you left room for a diplomatic mission in Greece,

491
00:27:17.640 --> 00:27:20.310
Syria than Asia minor. According to some sources,

492
00:27:20.311 --> 00:27:22.380
you have the occasion to meet Hannibal during the trip,

493
00:27:22.440 --> 00:27:25.910
the two chatted like old friends, talking history and strategy.

494
00:27:26.060 --> 00:27:29.690
Skipio asked Hannibal who he thought were the three greatest strategists,

495
00:27:29.820 --> 00:27:34.640
the devil lift, Hannibal replied Alexander, the great Paris and myself.

496
00:27:35.120 --> 00:27:36.200
Skip. You had another question,

497
00:27:36.350 --> 00:27:39.950
but what would you have said if you had conquered me Hannibal replied,

498
00:27:40.190 --> 00:27:44.240
I should then have said that I was greater than Alexander greater than Paris and

499
00:27:44.241 --> 00:27:48.200
greater than all other generals. The war with Syria eventually broke out.

500
00:27:48.830 --> 00:27:53.150
Skipio joined in 190 BC is nominal deputy to his brother Lucius.

501
00:27:53.210 --> 00:27:56.900
Unfortunately the two old foods did not meet again. Hannibal was in Phoenicia,

502
00:27:56.930 --> 00:28:00.920
raising a fleet for the Syrians and had been pinned down by the Navy of roads,

503
00:28:00.921 --> 00:28:03.110
allied to Rome in January of 189,

504
00:28:03.111 --> 00:28:07.880
BC Lucia Skipio defeated the Syrians and the battle of magnesium as older

505
00:28:07.881 --> 00:28:11.180
brother Publius was away from the battlefield, recovering from an illness,

506
00:28:11.210 --> 00:28:13.790
but he was the victim. At least in spirit,

507
00:28:13.970 --> 00:28:18.560
as Lucius had used his tactics and command legions that he had raised and

508
00:28:18.561 --> 00:28:22.040
trained himself after magnesia can Antioch sued for peace,

509
00:28:22.041 --> 00:28:25.760
agreeing to a payment of 15,000 silver talents to Rome of these,

510
00:28:25.940 --> 00:28:28.940
he paid an advance of 500 to the Scorpios.

511
00:28:29.600 --> 00:28:31.700
Africa has used this money for his private expenses,

512
00:28:31.880 --> 00:28:34.670
maybe to pay his soldiers wages. This is still not clear.

513
00:28:34.880 --> 00:28:38.120
What mattered is that he had spent that money without asking permission from the

514
00:28:38.121 --> 00:28:42.290
Senate. This was the occasion that Skipio his rivals fronted by Conte.

515
00:28:42.291 --> 00:28:45.860
The elder were waiting for, he put the Skipio brothers on trial twice.

516
00:28:45.890 --> 00:28:50.270
The first time in 187 BC Lucius was asked to produce the accounting ledger for

517
00:28:50.271 --> 00:28:51.320
the Syrian expedition,

518
00:28:51.350 --> 00:28:54.890
but Afrikanas intervened and tore it to pieces in front of the Senate.

519
00:28:55.010 --> 00:28:58.760
He then reminded them that he was being tried on the anniversary of his victory

520
00:28:58.870 --> 00:28:59.390
at Zama.

521
00:28:59.390 --> 00:29:03.220
The outcry was such that contract contented himself with a [inaudible] find

522
00:29:03.530 --> 00:29:05.510
solution at the second trial in 184,

523
00:29:05.511 --> 00:29:09.140
BC Carter accused scape you of embezzlement corruption and even planning to

524
00:29:09.141 --> 00:29:12.710
become King of Rome with a military coup this time Carter was vetoed from

525
00:29:12.830 --> 00:29:16.910
further prosecuting the general bite Senator Tiberias Gracos the elder.

526
00:29:17.210 --> 00:29:20.060
He was later Mary Skipio, his only daughter Cornelia.

527
00:29:20.150 --> 00:29:21.590
Despite these victories in court,

528
00:29:21.600 --> 00:29:24.500
Skipio had grown disgusted with the Roman political class.

529
00:29:24.530 --> 00:29:28.880
It was not willing to serve the Republic anymore. And so he retired to his farm.

530
00:29:29.180 --> 00:29:30.740
I'd listened them their Naples one day,

531
00:29:30.741 --> 00:29:34.190
a crew of pirates lands that listen to them and the old general prepared to face

532
00:29:34.191 --> 00:29:35.810
them weapons. In hands soon,

533
00:29:35.811 --> 00:29:37.880
he realized that the pirates are not coming to burn and loot.

534
00:29:38.150 --> 00:29:41.030
They only wanted to meet the famous Victor of Zama such was the,

535
00:29:41.290 --> 00:29:45.700
of Skipio throughout the ancient Mediterranean world and 183 BC Skipio.

536
00:29:45.730 --> 00:29:48.400
Must've heard the news. This in the lens of Bethany,

537
00:29:48.730 --> 00:29:50.860
Hannibal had committed suicide by poison.

538
00:29:51.010 --> 00:29:54.610
He had been vilified for his defeated Zimmer and forced to fleet Carthage,

539
00:29:54.611 --> 00:29:58.390
serving foreign Kings while escaping captured by the Romans that same year and

540
00:29:59.110 --> 00:30:02.260
183 BC, the greatest general room had ever gnomes to come to an illness.

541
00:30:02.500 --> 00:30:07.330
It was most likely malaria Publius Cornelius Skipio Africanas closed his eyes

542
00:30:07.331 --> 00:30:10.960
and joins many friends and enemies in the Elysian fields. And as well,

543
00:30:10.990 --> 00:30:14.440
he asked for his bones to be buried away from the ungrateful room.

544
00:30:14.910 --> 00:30:15.940
Skipio his legacy was enormous.

545
00:30:16.030 --> 00:30:19.570
His approach to strategy and innovative tactics revolutionized the armies of the

546
00:30:19.571 --> 00:30:20.404
Republic.

547
00:30:20.440 --> 00:30:23.800
His conquests launched the expansion of Rome beyond the confines of Italy.

548
00:30:23.950 --> 00:30:27.700
His defeat of Carthage made the Romans a sea of power unrivaled in the

549
00:30:27.701 --> 00:30:31.180
Mediterranean and as the cult of loyalty among his men and legions created a

550
00:30:31.720 --> 00:30:35.080
precedence for the emergence of characters like Julius Caesar and Augustus and

551
00:30:35.410 --> 00:30:35.440
shores,

552
00:30:35.440 --> 00:30:39.070
the life and achievements of Skipio Afrikanas were a major turning point in

553
00:30:39.071 --> 00:30:43.390
which the history of the Republic became it was the downhill slope toward an

554
00:30:43.391 --> 00:30:46.180
empire. So I really hope you found that video. Interesting. If you did,
