6
00:00:24.410 --> 00:00:27.980
She's one of the longest serving prime ministers in British history as head of

7
00:00:27.981 --> 00:00:32.840
the conservative party. Margaret Thatcher led the UK for a May, 1979, right?

8
00:00:32.841 --> 00:00:36.170
The way through to November of 1990. In that time,

9
00:00:36.171 --> 00:00:40.340
she ushered in an era of reform unparalleled in the 20th century under her

10
00:00:40.640 --> 00:00:44.300
watch, the post-war settlement was torn up. State assets were privatized.

11
00:00:44.390 --> 00:00:48.980
The financial market let rip and to the cultural fabric of Britain changed

12
00:00:48.981 --> 00:00:50.000
beyond recognition,

13
00:00:50.030 --> 00:00:53.600
but the transformations didn't just stop at home alongside her U S counterpart

14
00:00:53.660 --> 00:00:54.493
for Ronald Reagan.

15
00:00:54.530 --> 00:00:58.940
Snapchat helped spread the gospel of economic Liberty and individual freedom

16
00:00:58.970 --> 00:01:01.610
across the entire planet. When she finally left office,

17
00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:05.510
she was widely recognized as the most significant British leader since

18
00:01:05.511 --> 00:01:08.960
Churchill. Yes, while Churchill is still widely loved in the UK.

19
00:01:08.990 --> 00:01:12.650
Margaret Thatcher's legacy is hugely divisive taking over an alien Britain,

20
00:01:12.651 --> 00:01:15.950
her economic shock therapy devastated in Tanya regions,

21
00:01:16.190 --> 00:01:20.240
even as it saved the country as a whole, both worships and reviled at home.

22
00:01:20.450 --> 00:01:23.900
This is the story of Britain's most controversial leader.

23
00:01:30.320 --> 00:01:30.380
<v 1>[Inaudible].</v>

24
00:01:30.380 --> 00:01:33.830
<v 0>When Margaret Hilda Roberts was born on October the 13th, 1925,</v>

25
00:01:34.070 --> 00:01:36.770
there was nothing that suggested she would one day lead her nation.

26
00:01:36.860 --> 00:01:40.640
Her father was a grocer and two young Margaret's grew up in achingly modest

27
00:01:40.641 --> 00:01:41.540
circumstances.

28
00:01:41.810 --> 00:01:45.440
The family had no indoor toilet and warm water was an unknown luxury. Yes,

29
00:01:45.441 --> 00:01:48.830
it wasn't a petty voice for our lifestyle alone that made Margaret and unlikely

30
00:01:48.831 --> 00:01:50.150
candidate for future PM.

31
00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:55.250
It was the fact that she was a sheep right up until Fanshawe became education

32
00:01:55.251 --> 00:01:56.780
secretary in 1969,

33
00:01:56.960 --> 00:02:01.190
there were only ever been four female cabinet ministers in UK history and not a

34
00:02:01.191 --> 00:02:05.780
single prime minister as Snapchat herself would say an ITV interview in 1973,

35
00:02:05.990 --> 00:02:09.410
the idea of a woman ever rising beyond the cabinet to become prime minister

36
00:02:09.680 --> 00:02:11.150
seemed impossible still,

37
00:02:11.180 --> 00:02:15.260
despite living in a society that considered casual sexism, a legitimate hobby,

38
00:02:15.500 --> 00:02:19.280
Margaret never really felt she needed to pursue needy like interests.

39
00:02:19.340 --> 00:02:20.750
Her major passion was chemistry,

40
00:02:20.751 --> 00:02:23.990
which she studied at Oxford under the Nobel prize winner, Dorothy Hodgkin,

41
00:02:24.050 --> 00:02:28.610
but even as she was winning plaudits for her science work faccia was discovering

42
00:02:28.880 --> 00:02:33.170
her other lifelong love politics in 1945, the UK,

43
00:02:33.260 --> 00:02:37.460
his first post-war election resulted in a shock when not for Winston Churchill's

44
00:02:37.461 --> 00:02:40.850
conservatives, but for the left-wing labor party of climate.

45
00:02:40.851 --> 00:02:45.230
Antley the labor landslide completely appended Britain in his six years in power

46
00:02:45.260 --> 00:02:46.760
actually created the NHS,

47
00:02:46.850 --> 00:02:50.960
the welfare state and what became known as the post-war settlements and unspoken

48
00:02:50.961 --> 00:02:54.620
agreements between the parties that the state needed to interfere in the

49
00:02:54.621 --> 00:02:59.000
economy. Naturally Sacha hated this one year after athletes took power,

50
00:02:59.170 --> 00:03:03.160
became president of the Oxford university conservative association from where

51
00:03:03.161 --> 00:03:06.460
she railed against the labor tide to transforming Britain. So good.

52
00:03:06.461 --> 00:03:10.900
Was she at this that it soon convinced her to enter politics proper at the 1950

53
00:03:10.901 --> 00:03:14.440
election banter stood as a conservative candidate for the seat of Darfur or

54
00:03:14.450 --> 00:03:17.260
someone who party were appalled at the idea of a lady human running.

55
00:03:17.260 --> 00:03:21.970
She still managed to increase our share of the local vote by 50% and early sign

56
00:03:21.971 --> 00:03:23.380
of a electoral prowess,

57
00:03:23.440 --> 00:03:27.700
but it wasn't enough to win nor did notice enough votes in the 1951 election.

58
00:03:27.730 --> 00:03:31.570
Despite this being the election that saw Churchill and the conservatives

59
00:03:31.571 --> 00:03:33.790
returned to power, yes, all was not lost.

60
00:03:33.880 --> 00:03:37.540
It was through her campaigning in Darfur that Margaret met Dennis Snapchat,

61
00:03:37.840 --> 00:03:41.680
a rich, somewhat dopey guy, Dennis would turn out to be the ideal husband.

62
00:03:41.740 --> 00:03:45.430
He was tremendously supportive of Margaret's ambitions for public office.

63
00:03:45.431 --> 00:03:49.540
And so hands-off, it was like he was permanently wearing a straight jacket.

64
00:03:49.690 --> 00:03:52.540
Although this did have some odd side effects such as when Dennis went to the

65
00:03:52.900 --> 00:03:55.180
cricket rather than interfere in the birth of their children.

66
00:03:55.450 --> 00:03:58.300
He was the solid supportive rock that Margaret needed,

67
00:03:58.420 --> 00:04:03.160
especially now that our interest in politics was becoming an obsession in 1959,

68
00:04:03.161 --> 00:04:06.970
after a few years practicing as a barrister thunderous stood again for election.

69
00:04:07.030 --> 00:04:11.080
This time in the conservative safe seat of Finchley unsurprisingly,

70
00:04:11.110 --> 00:04:12.730
she won most surprisingly.

71
00:04:12.880 --> 00:04:17.200
She soon began to skyrockets up through the party's ranks by 1961.

72
00:04:17.290 --> 00:04:20.350
She had been appointed secretary in the ministry of pensions and national

73
00:04:20.351 --> 00:04:23.500
insurance. Although her party lost power in 1964,

74
00:04:23.650 --> 00:04:26.950
it's new leader to adhese invited her into the shadow cabinet,

75
00:04:27.010 --> 00:04:29.770
sadly not the Tory version of the council of doom,

76
00:04:29.771 --> 00:04:34.090
but what us Brits call the out of power parties, highest ranking members.

77
00:04:34.150 --> 00:04:37.960
Then men's that's when he unexpectedly won the 1970 election,

78
00:04:37.961 --> 00:04:41.950
Margaret Thatcher became only the fifth female cabinet minister in British

79
00:04:41.951 --> 00:04:44.350
history display working for a party full of men.

80
00:04:44.351 --> 00:04:45.940
Who'd never quite immensely removed.

81
00:04:45.941 --> 00:04:48.730
The no girls allowed sign from their tree houses.

82
00:04:48.910 --> 00:04:52.510
Sacha had ascended to one of the top positions in the lands.

83
00:04:52.570 --> 00:04:55.930
Let's all could anyone have known? This was only the start.

84
00:05:02.040 --> 00:05:02.160
<v 2>[Inaudible].</v>

85
00:05:02.160 --> 00:05:03.150
<v 0>For anyone living in Britain,</v>

86
00:05:03.180 --> 00:05:07.290
the 1970s being on the world's worst roller coaster.

87
00:05:07.470 --> 00:05:11.460
It was a decade when Britain teetered on the verge of bankruptcy when powerful

88
00:05:11.461 --> 00:05:15.510
unions called strikes that paralyzed the country. But for Margaret Sacha,

89
00:05:15.540 --> 00:05:20.490
it was also the decade when everyone associated her primarily with milk in

90
00:05:20.491 --> 00:05:21.330
1971,

91
00:05:21.360 --> 00:05:25.350
looking to make savings in the education budget Sanchez eliminated a post-war

92
00:05:25.351 --> 00:05:29.370
policy, a free school milk for children. Although it was justifiable,

93
00:05:29.400 --> 00:05:33.420
the optics were so bad that it became a PR disaster for the rest of our 10 year

94
00:05:33.480 --> 00:05:38.460
factual. It was followed everywhere by cries of Thatcher milk snatch up,

95
00:05:38.490 --> 00:05:40.380
but I'm pleasant as this was,

96
00:05:40.410 --> 00:05:45.030
it was nothing compared to what was going on behind the scenes Pacha and Ted

97
00:05:45.031 --> 00:05:48.210
Heath hated one another while it was partly personal.

98
00:05:48.211 --> 00:05:51.840
It was also Satcher being sick of defending her government's dreadful record.

99
00:05:52.110 --> 00:05:52.950
It was under Heath.

100
00:05:53.090 --> 00:05:56.730
The three-day week came in when businesses were only allowed electricity three

101
00:05:56.731 --> 00:05:58.940
days a to conserve energy. As a result,

102
00:05:58.980 --> 00:06:01.970
the conservatives lost both 1974 elections.

103
00:06:02.060 --> 00:06:03.890
Suddenly Sacha was out of governments,

104
00:06:03.891 --> 00:06:08.510
but now the grocer's daughter from Lincoln Cher knew what she had to do.

105
00:06:08.780 --> 00:06:11.510
She had to get rid of Heath these days,

106
00:06:11.540 --> 00:06:15.260
losing an election means stepping down as leader of your party. But back then,

107
00:06:15.440 --> 00:06:19.700
you could keep right on trucking so long as no one challenged you to a

108
00:06:19.701 --> 00:06:23.090
leadership contest. The conservatives being the policy of loyalty,

109
00:06:23.120 --> 00:06:26.810
no one wanted to challenge Heath, except for Thatcher.

110
00:06:26.900 --> 00:06:29.840
The newspapers thought she was out of her mind went that just stood for leader

111
00:06:29.841 --> 00:06:33.590
of the Tories. It was assumed that he would rom home to victory,

112
00:06:33.710 --> 00:06:37.460
but faccia went on the attack, gathering the polities right-wing around her.

113
00:06:37.461 --> 00:06:41.420
She lambasted he dreadful record in February, 1975.

114
00:06:41.421 --> 00:06:45.620
The shock results of the first ballot came in. Sacha had a one.

115
00:06:45.740 --> 00:06:47.840
Now under the conservative parties, weird rules.

116
00:06:47.841 --> 00:06:50.060
This didn't actually make her the leader,

117
00:06:50.090 --> 00:06:54.350
but he could see his position was untenable and he stepped aside.

118
00:06:54.670 --> 00:06:58.550
And just like that thought she became the first female leader of a major UK

119
00:06:58.551 --> 00:07:02.990
party. Not that anyone expected her to rise any further. In 1975,

120
00:07:02.991 --> 00:07:07.190
the labor government was headed by the affable broadly popular Harold Wilson.

121
00:07:07.310 --> 00:07:11.840
So what if stature was making barnstorming anticommunist speeches that earned

122
00:07:12.050 --> 00:07:15.500
the nickname, the iron lady. So what if the Tories were getting better?

123
00:07:15.501 --> 00:07:19.550
A messaging with Wilson leading the labor party. She was probably doomed.

124
00:07:19.670 --> 00:07:23.750
Unfortunately for labor Wilson, wouldn't be around much longer in 1976,

125
00:07:23.810 --> 00:07:26.150
Harold Wilson abruptly resigned as prime minister.

126
00:07:26.330 --> 00:07:29.780
I move now thought to have been brought on by the discovery that he had early

127
00:07:29.781 --> 00:07:30.770
stage Alzheimer's.

128
00:07:30.860 --> 00:07:34.940
His replacement was a charisma void known as James Callahan guy.

129
00:07:35.080 --> 00:07:39.740
It's so inept that he turns a mildly pro-labor country into rabid

130
00:07:40.550 --> 00:07:43.490
Tories. Under Callaghan Britain collapsed in his economic terminal.

131
00:07:43.880 --> 00:07:48.560
What gigantic pay freezes nationwide battles with overpowered unions in late

132
00:07:48.561 --> 00:07:52.010
1978, things culminated in the winter of discontent periods.

133
00:07:52.011 --> 00:07:56.870
When uncollected refuse piled high in the streets and bodies were left on

134
00:07:56.871 --> 00:08:00.050
buried, it was likely the country's post-war low points.

135
00:08:00.080 --> 00:08:03.050
The UK was an ungovernable mess.

136
00:08:03.170 --> 00:08:06.440
It was also exactly what sanction needed on March the 28th,

137
00:08:06.470 --> 00:08:09.380
Margaret Thatcher called a no confidence vote in Callahan's government

138
00:08:09.680 --> 00:08:12.080
triggering an early election. As the campaign heated up,

139
00:08:12.110 --> 00:08:16.790
the conservatives played a blinder plastering London with posters of long dollar

140
00:08:17.300 --> 00:08:20.480
queues under the caption labor isn't working Callaghan.

141
00:08:20.481 --> 00:08:25.160
Meanwhile gave the impression of someone who expected to win because, well, duh,

142
00:08:25.220 --> 00:08:27.980
his opponent was a go on may the third, 1979.

143
00:08:27.981 --> 00:08:31.400
The conservatives won the election by a decent margin. It wasn't a landslide,

144
00:08:31.700 --> 00:08:34.700
but it was definitely enough to comfortably form a government on that date.

145
00:08:34.730 --> 00:08:38.090
Margaret, that trip became not only the UK, his first female prime minister,

146
00:08:38.270 --> 00:08:42.650
but the first female leader of any major Western democracy as she ends at 10

147
00:08:42.651 --> 00:08:44.810
Downing street, the triumphant that just declared.

148
00:08:45.510 --> 00:08:48.340
<v 3>Well, that is discord. Maybe bring harmony.</v>

149
00:08:49.060 --> 00:08:52.210
<v 0>To see this wouldn't exactly happen. Now,</v>

150
00:08:52.211 --> 00:08:56.880
before we get on with the trials and tribulations of Ms. Here's a quick word

151
00:08:56.881 --> 00:09:00.600
from our sponsor. Now, if you're online, you really should be using a VPN.

152
00:09:00.930 --> 00:09:03.780
And that's when Nord VPN comes in as tempting not to bond this summit,

153
00:09:03.781 --> 00:09:04.890
we'll just hope for the best,

154
00:09:04.891 --> 00:09:08.370
but really those stories you read about people having their data stolen,

155
00:09:08.371 --> 00:09:12.330
they do happen, and you don't want to make it easy for anyone to do that to you.

156
00:09:12.331 --> 00:09:13.830
Whether it's a nefarious actor,

157
00:09:13.831 --> 00:09:17.850
snooping for your private information or companies tracking your privacy,

158
00:09:17.910 --> 00:09:20.220
but a VPN is not so much more. For example,

159
00:09:20.221 --> 00:09:23.970
Nord VPN lets you access any of its thousands of sevens in different countries,

160
00:09:23.971 --> 00:09:27.390
all around the globe. So if you've hit the end of your Netflix queue,

161
00:09:27.510 --> 00:09:31.260
simply try changing the location of your server and get access to content

162
00:09:31.261 --> 00:09:34.950
libraries that do the licensing agreements are only available in specific

163
00:09:34.951 --> 00:09:36.150
geographic locations.

164
00:09:36.150 --> 00:09:40.590

Also there are no logs because Nord is based in Panama,

171
00:09:58.350 --> 00:10:00.330

00:10:00.510 --> 00:10:01.890

178
00:10:22.850 --> 00:10:23.683
<v 4>[Inaudible].</v>

179
00:10:24.470 --> 00:10:25.430
<v 0>In 82 dawns,</v>

180
00:10:25.460 --> 00:10:29.060
it looked like Britain's first female PM was doomed to be a one-term.

181
00:10:29.270 --> 00:10:32.540
One up in the first year is in power. Thatcher had sent out a governing style,

182
00:10:32.570 --> 00:10:36.080
antagonistic determines destructive in a weird way.

183
00:10:36.110 --> 00:10:40.340
She was like a 2010s tech mogul. Someone who disrupted, who broke stuff,

184
00:10:40.370 --> 00:10:44.420
who assembled something from the wreckage of the old, during a later terms,

185
00:10:44.421 --> 00:10:48.230
the economic gains from this destruction would be enough to keep middle England

186
00:10:48.231 --> 00:10:53.030
on the side. But as a first time, swamped by those games had yet to materialize.

187
00:10:53.090 --> 00:10:55.370
All anyone could see was the destruction.

188
00:10:55.430 --> 00:10:59.510
More businesses were failing than at any time since the great depression,

189
00:10:59.600 --> 00:11:03.530
unemployment was at record breaking highs, privatization of state assets.

190
00:11:03.670 --> 00:11:05.900
It's so far cost tens of thousands of jobs,

191
00:11:06.170 --> 00:11:08.240
but not yet brought visible benefits.

192
00:11:08.450 --> 00:11:10.910
This slider famous declaration in October of 1980,

193
00:11:11.150 --> 00:11:13.760
thus the ladies not for turning Sanchez,

194
00:11:13.761 --> 00:11:18.410
closest advisors were secretly urging her to make a gigantic U-turn lest the

195
00:11:18.860 --> 00:11:21.260
Tories be stomped at the 1983 election.

196
00:11:21.680 --> 00:11:26.390
And it was onto this sinking ship that Argentina suddenly through a gigantic

197
00:11:26.391 --> 00:11:29.300
lifesaver and okay, let's just have a quick geography lesson.

198
00:11:29.301 --> 00:11:30.650
Now down in the South Atlantic,

199
00:11:30.651 --> 00:11:35.420
about 483 kilometers off the Argentine coast lines, the Falkland islands,

200
00:11:35.450 --> 00:11:38.720
despite being nearly 13,000 kilometers from London,

201
00:11:38.900 --> 00:11:43.100
they've been a British territory since at least 1833 by 1982, though,

202
00:11:43.101 --> 00:11:47.690
the Falklands were only home to a declining population of 1,800 people.

203
00:11:47.780 --> 00:11:51.080
Although Britain still claims the territory. It refused to invest.

204
00:11:51.081 --> 00:11:53.030
That ends the, of the type of successive.

205
00:11:53.560 --> 00:11:57.940
That being that the Islanders would voluntarily accept Argentinian silver and D

206
00:11:57.941 --> 00:11:59.320
at some point in the future.

207
00:11:59.380 --> 00:12:03.490
But the military junta in Buenos Aires was tired of waiting on April the second,

208
00:12:03.520 --> 00:12:07.000
1982, they occupied the Falklands a few days later,

209
00:12:07.180 --> 00:12:10.120
they also took the British territory of South Georgia.

210
00:12:10.300 --> 00:12:15.070
The Hunter assumed London was too broke to unwilling to send soldiers to die for

211
00:12:15.340 --> 00:12:19.570
the sake of a godforsaken rock. On the other side of the world, they went Eddie,

212
00:12:19.990 --> 00:12:20.860
right when news broke,

213
00:12:20.861 --> 00:12:24.010
the cabinets feeling was that the Falklands would have to be surrendered,

214
00:12:24.160 --> 00:12:28.690
but the Hunter hadn't counted on Fetcher egged on by the Navy founders declared

215
00:12:28.691 --> 00:12:29.620
war in Argentina,

216
00:12:29.740 --> 00:12:34.030
a Royal Navy flew flotilla was sent to retake the islands without the Falklands

217
00:12:34.031 --> 00:12:35.110
war began today.

218
00:12:35.260 --> 00:12:39.490
It's almost impossible to overstate the effects the short war had on Thatcher's

219
00:12:39.491 --> 00:12:41.800
popularity. Remember how George W.

220
00:12:41.800 --> 00:12:45.460
Bush his approval rating hit 92% often nine 11? Well,

221
00:12:45.461 --> 00:12:47.230
something similar happens here.

222
00:12:47.440 --> 00:12:51.460
Fetches resolute defense of British territory struck a chord with ordinary

223
00:12:51.461 --> 00:12:52.180
citizens.

224
00:12:52.180 --> 00:12:56.110
It helps that the war was short lasting in our 74 days before Argentina

225
00:12:56.111 --> 00:12:56.860
surrendered.

226
00:12:56.860 --> 00:13:01.570
And that it was a very one-sided 649 Argentine troops were killed

227
00:13:01.780 --> 00:13:05.110
versus 255 British troops, but make no mistake.

228
00:13:05.140 --> 00:13:08.380
The iron will fascia displayed in the face of foreign aggression,

229
00:13:08.710 --> 00:13:09.610
made her a hero.

230
00:13:09.850 --> 00:13:13.270
It's elevated our profile on the international stage already allied with us,

231
00:13:13.271 --> 00:13:14.350
president Ronald Reagan.

232
00:13:14.351 --> 00:13:19.030
She now started to look like as equal come the 1983 election facture

233
00:13:19.090 --> 00:13:23.140
crushed labor in a landslide with a powerful new mandate.

234
00:13:23.560 --> 00:13:26.530
The gloves were lost off over the next two times.

235
00:13:26.531 --> 00:13:30.610
Margaret nacho was going to change person beyond all recognition.

236
00:13:37.320 --> 00:13:37.380
<v 2>[Inaudible].</v>

237
00:13:37.380 --> 00:13:40.740
<v 0>The second time began with a powerful message appointing Ian McGregor,</v>

238
00:13:40.770 --> 00:13:43.740
head of the national coal board. Back in 1979,

239
00:13:43.741 --> 00:13:47.730
Thatcher had hired McGregor to make the state owns British steel profitable.

240
00:13:47.731 --> 00:13:52.380
Again, McGregor had achieved this at the loss of 95,000 jobs under the economic

241
00:13:52.381 --> 00:13:54.900
devastation of entire towns.

242
00:13:54.930 --> 00:13:59.070
Now SAMSHA was asking him to do the same thing for the alien coal industry,

243
00:13:59.220 --> 00:14:02.370
but while British steel had folded to McGregor's on will,

244
00:14:03.090 --> 00:14:04.440
coal was going to be much tougher.

245
00:14:04.500 --> 00:14:08.340
The national union of minors was Britain's most powerful union at a time when

246
00:14:08.341 --> 00:14:10.830
unions could break an entire premier ship,

247
00:14:10.980 --> 00:14:15.600
it was the num in 1973 that had exacerbated the three-day week

248
00:14:15.630 --> 00:14:19.920
leading to Ted heat's downfall. Now they were looking to do the same to shot.

249
00:14:20.070 --> 00:14:23.280
Unfortunately for the num Fancher had brought to this figurative.

250
00:14:23.730 --> 00:14:28.140
NIFA is not just a gun, but a bazooka on March the sixth,

251
00:14:28.830 --> 00:14:33.330
1984, a local strike at caught in corollary was used by anyone president Arthur

252
00:14:33.331 --> 00:14:37.620
Scargill to force a general strike across the nation. But Tasha was prepared.

253
00:14:38.010 --> 00:14:41.910
Cold had been secretly stockpiled non-unionized firms were hired to do strike

254
00:14:41.911 --> 00:14:45.510
breaking police forces were prime to fight the battle was on,

255
00:14:45.660 --> 00:14:48.540
and it really was a battle or rather a series of battles.

256
00:14:48.720 --> 00:14:53.720
The West took place at Audrey when a police jog into a crowd of strikers led to

257
00:14:53.721 --> 00:14:58.490
123 serious injuries, but the main weapon Sandra deployed wasn't truncheons.

258
00:14:58.850 --> 00:15:01.760
But time as the strike dragged on, laws were passed.

259
00:15:01.761 --> 00:15:05.300
That stops the families of striking miners from receiving welfare. And in fact,

260
00:15:05.750 --> 00:15:09.380
fascia starved her enemies into submission and submit they did on March the

261
00:15:09.381 --> 00:15:10.400
third, 1985,

262
00:15:10.401 --> 00:15:14.840
that strike was called off the miners returned to work broken over the next

263
00:15:14.841 --> 00:15:18.170
decade McGregor and his success closed all but 15 of Britain's,

264
00:15:18.171 --> 00:15:19.940
174 deep pits.

265
00:15:20.120 --> 00:15:23.210
The economic engine of entire regions was wiped out,

266
00:15:23.480 --> 00:15:27.830
leaving jobless wastelands with num defeated the days of big unions,

267
00:15:27.831 --> 00:15:32.810
bringing Britain to a standstill where over below Thatcher won this war just as

268
00:15:32.811 --> 00:15:33.710
she had the Falklands.

269
00:15:33.950 --> 00:15:37.610
The other great war of a premiership would prove to the unwinnable.

270
00:15:37.850 --> 00:15:40.520
The troubles were an undeclared civil war in Northern Ireland,

271
00:15:40.610 --> 00:15:44.770
the pitted majority Protestant unionists who wanted to stay in the UK against

272
00:15:44.790 --> 00:15:48.230
majority Catholic Republicans who wanted to join Ireland proper.

273
00:15:48.260 --> 00:15:51.380
When Sacha took power, the troubles had already been running for a decade,

274
00:15:51.440 --> 00:15:53.720
but they were about to get much worse.

275
00:15:53.930 --> 00:15:56.810
Things really kicked off on August the 27th, 1979.

276
00:15:56.811 --> 00:15:59.930
When the IRA first assassinated a member of the Royal family,

277
00:16:00.080 --> 00:16:04.370
Lord Mountbatten before killing 18 British soldiers in a double bomb attack.

278
00:16:04.520 --> 00:16:09.170
But that his biggest test came in March of 1981 that month IRA prisoners,

279
00:16:09.171 --> 00:16:10.490
including member of parliament,

280
00:16:10.520 --> 00:16:14.690
Bobby sens began a hunger strike to force the British state to treat them as

281
00:16:14.691 --> 00:16:15.560
prisoners of war.

282
00:16:15.860 --> 00:16:19.520
The thoughts horrified Thatcher who declared the men were common criminal saying

283
00:16:19.700 --> 00:16:21.950
crime is crime is crime.

284
00:16:22.280 --> 00:16:26.120
It is not political by the time October rolled around 10 of the hunger strikers

285
00:16:26.121 --> 00:16:29.690
were dead and then mistreatment and turn them into international celebrities.

286
00:16:29.780 --> 00:16:33.920
It, it also turns stature into a Republican hate figure. On the 12th of October,

287
00:16:33.921 --> 00:16:38.750
1984, an IRA bomb at the conservative conference in Brighton killed five people.

288
00:16:39.220 --> 00:16:41.060
Santura escaped on harms and made a speech.

289
00:16:41.061 --> 00:16:43.100
The following day vowing to fight on.

290
00:16:43.310 --> 00:16:48.170
She hopes to inflict a decisive victory on the forces of republicanism. Instead,

291
00:16:48.530 --> 00:16:50.750
the troubles went supernova over the next few years.

292
00:16:50.751 --> 00:16:52.310
The IRA bombed civilians skills,

293
00:16:52.320 --> 00:16:55.580
policemen with mortars and even assassinated patches, friends,

294
00:16:55.581 --> 00:16:57.380
the conservative MP in gal.

295
00:16:57.530 --> 00:17:00.560
It wouldn't be until Facciola left office that the troubles would come to an

296
00:17:00.561 --> 00:17:04.670
end. Thanks to the work of her successes, John major and Tony Blair.

297
00:17:04.880 --> 00:17:08.690
Although it was far from the defining theme of her premiership Sanchez failed

298
00:17:08.691 --> 00:17:12.680
attempt to defeat the IRA showed the limits of the iron ladies power.

299
00:17:12.920 --> 00:17:17.360
Sometimes just sometimes perhaps the lady should have been for turning

300
00:17:24.130 --> 00:17:26.170
The Wars and anti union crusades.

301
00:17:26.590 --> 00:17:30.730
Maggie was also overseeing a social revolution, Thatcherism preached hard work,

302
00:17:30.790 --> 00:17:33.490
personal responsibility and economic liberalism.

303
00:17:33.580 --> 00:17:36.550
It promised a world in which anyone could become well off provided.

304
00:17:36.551 --> 00:17:38.230
They were happy to roll up their sleeves.

305
00:17:38.470 --> 00:17:42.280
While this may have seemed a joke to those in depressed former mining towns,

306
00:17:42.520 --> 00:17:45.430
it was true for enough people to keep her in power.

307
00:17:45.520 --> 00:17:48.070
One of the most popular policies was right to buy,

308
00:17:48.071 --> 00:17:51.720
which allowed those in council housing to save up and buy the place for

309
00:17:51.721 --> 00:17:52.470
themselves.

310
00:17:52.470 --> 00:17:56.010
But the biggest rewards fell to those who profited from the big bang.

311
00:17:56.100 --> 00:17:57.300
As early as 1979,

312
00:17:57.750 --> 00:18:00.840
fascia had begun loosening regulations in London's financial sector,

313
00:18:01.050 --> 00:18:05.160
leading to a lot of people becoming very rich, but it was on October the 27th,

314
00:18:05.161 --> 00:18:08.610
1986, that things really took off. That was the day.

315
00:18:08.760 --> 00:18:12.990
The city was almost completely deregulated allowing things like foreign firms to

316
00:18:13.020 --> 00:18:17.580
own UK brokers and demolishing the fixed commission on trades overnight.

317
00:18:17.640 --> 00:18:22.170
The big bang made 1,500 million as it created iconic districts like

318
00:18:22.320 --> 00:18:26.610
London's Canary Wharf skyscrapers began to sprout out money poured in.

319
00:18:26.820 --> 00:18:30.480
It was the transformation of the financial sector from the bowler hat wearing

320
00:18:30.481 --> 00:18:35.160
old boys club of yesteryear into the turbo capitalist free for all of today.

321
00:18:35.580 --> 00:18:36.090
Yes,

322
00:18:36.090 --> 00:18:39.690
ventures revolution went beyond the mere confines of Britain under our watch.

323
00:18:39.691 --> 00:18:41.580
The UK became a global player in a way.

324
00:18:41.581 --> 00:18:45.780
It simply hadn't been since Churchill left office in 1994, for example,

325
00:18:46.050 --> 00:18:49.890
Thatcher began courting Mikhail Gorbachev even before he became Soviet leader

326
00:18:49.980 --> 00:18:53.760
during a visit to Britain Gorbachev famously had a six hour argument with Sacha

327
00:18:53.940 --> 00:18:57.120
over the benefits and ills of communism when they were done that just declared.

328
00:18:57.480 --> 00:19:01.230
We can do business together and set about becoming both Gorbachev's best friends

329
00:19:01.231 --> 00:19:02.640
and worst enemy in the West,

330
00:19:02.910 --> 00:19:06.990
Virginia skeptical Ronald Reagan to work with a new Soviet premier.

331
00:19:07.050 --> 00:19:09.240
Not that she'd let Russia push her around though.

332
00:19:09.270 --> 00:19:11.550
Invited to the Soviet union in 1987,

333
00:19:11.910 --> 00:19:16.260
bachelor winds on live TV and spend an hour talking about all the USSR failings

334
00:19:16.500 --> 00:19:18.180
for citizens and communist nations.

335
00:19:18.210 --> 00:19:22.320
That speech was like seeing someone articulate everything they'd been feeling

336
00:19:22.321 --> 00:19:25.800
for decades. Fascia became an overnight celebrity in the Eastern block.

337
00:19:25.860 --> 00:19:27.690
Even today, countries like the Czech Republic,

338
00:19:27.720 --> 00:19:32.550
consider her a British hero on par with Churchill, but there were missteps too,

339
00:19:32.640 --> 00:19:34.170
in the last part of the 1980s,

340
00:19:34.620 --> 00:19:38.220
Thatcher vehemently opposed sanctions against South Africa's apartheid regime.

341
00:19:38.460 --> 00:19:42.900
She considered Nelson Mandela, typical terrorist and proudly boasted.

342
00:19:42.901 --> 00:19:46.980
That Britain was the only Commonwealth nation still trading with the white

343
00:19:46.981 --> 00:19:50.190
supremacist state. Ouch. Yes,

344
00:19:50.370 --> 00:19:53.430
there were also surprised moments when she broke her own party's line.

345
00:19:53.520 --> 00:19:54.570
In the late 1980s,

346
00:19:54.571 --> 00:19:58.230
she became one of the first world leaders to sound the alarm on climate change,

347
00:19:58.410 --> 00:20:02.670
helping push for a world environment funds the preservation of rainforests and

348
00:20:02.671 --> 00:20:05.430
the introduction of emissions targets. Overall.

349
00:20:05.431 --> 00:20:08.460
Then there was enough popular staff in the financial programs who ensure that

350
00:20:08.461 --> 00:20:11.190
she cruised to an easy victory in 1987,

351
00:20:11.191 --> 00:20:15.720
becoming the UK is only 20th century leader to serve three terms.

352
00:20:15.930 --> 00:20:17.850
And still she seemed destined to go on.

353
00:20:17.970 --> 00:20:20.610
There was even talk of her winning a possible fourth term,

354
00:20:20.910 --> 00:20:24.660
but it was not to be the woman who had overhauled Britain had already sowed the

355
00:20:24.661 --> 00:20:27.300
seeds of our own destruction. When the ends finally came,

356
00:20:27.330 --> 00:20:30.240
it was going to be with a swiftness that shocked everybody.

357
00:20:37.040 --> 00:20:37.130
<v 6>Indians.</v>

358
00:20:37.130 --> 00:20:40.940
<v 0>What brought factor down was what has brought down every single conservative</v>

359
00:20:40.941 --> 00:20:43.760
prime minister since Europe on January,

360
00:20:43.761 --> 00:20:48.340
the first 1973 tat Heath had taken Britain into what was the European economic

361
00:20:48.341 --> 00:20:52.810
community, a move confirmed by a 1975 referendum come the 1980s,

362
00:20:52.811 --> 00:20:56.830
the conservatives were still mostly a pro Europe party, at least in theory,

363
00:20:57.010 --> 00:21:00.730
unlike our MPS Fancher was rabidly anti Europe. At first,

364
00:21:00.731 --> 00:21:03.280
this was something that MPS managed as best. They could.

365
00:21:03.370 --> 00:21:06.880
It even occasionally brought benefits when Thatcher reduced Britain's budget

366
00:21:06.881 --> 00:21:10.390
contributions in 1984, but it soon became a major liability.

367
00:21:10.660 --> 00:21:12.310
As the consonants integrated further,

368
00:21:12.311 --> 00:21:16.330
Estancia became a vocal Euro-skeptic rallying against the consonance leaders.

369
00:21:16.540 --> 00:21:19.900
This would be fine if she had managed to get a party on side,

370
00:21:20.020 --> 00:21:22.810
but official policy remained pro Europe. In fact,

371
00:21:23.410 --> 00:21:25.660
Snapchat was sabotaging her own governments. There was a,

372
00:21:25.690 --> 00:21:27.910
was a string of senior ministers resigning,

373
00:21:27.940 --> 00:21:31.810
all contributing to a perception that the Tories were becoming dangerously and

374
00:21:32.410 --> 00:21:32.530
competence.

375
00:21:32.530 --> 00:21:36.370
Then just as this gigantic pile of fertilizer was starting to look extremely

376
00:21:36.371 --> 00:21:40.330
combustible. Fascia threw an unrelated match onto it.

377
00:21:40.450 --> 00:21:45.130
The poll tax is why Scotland is to this day. Passionately anti Tori,

378
00:21:45.340 --> 00:21:48.340
a political move designed to deprive labor councils of revenue.

379
00:21:48.490 --> 00:21:52.660
It's abolished local tax rates. Instead levying a flat tax on every adult.

380
00:21:52.770 --> 00:21:55.390
They don't show it walls that the rich saw their bills plummet while the

381
00:21:55.990 --> 00:21:58.720
middle-class is the very backbone of the Thatcherite revolutions.

382
00:21:58.721 --> 00:22:01.240
All their costs go shooting up in 1999.

383
00:22:01.450 --> 00:22:04.690
That's a pint as it is in Scotland ahead of a rollout across England and Wales,

384
00:22:04.780 --> 00:22:08.470
it was a disaster. There were protests mass acts of civil disobedience.

385
00:22:08.680 --> 00:22:13.000
By 1990 over 1 million had refused to pay ministers begged Snapchat,

386
00:22:13.030 --> 00:22:17.320
not to push ahead with the hate attacks, but like a latter day, George,

387
00:22:17.321 --> 00:22:21.250
the third Thatcher insisted on it on March 31st,

388
00:22:21.250 --> 00:22:25.240
1990 central London was devastated by an anti poll tax rot that summit

389
00:22:25.300 --> 00:22:27.970
discontent brewed across the nation. Sadly by now,

390
00:22:28.000 --> 00:22:30.940
Maggie had become a caricature of herself. She was the iron lady,

391
00:22:30.941 --> 00:22:34.840
not for turning, even when turning would have saved her political career.

392
00:22:35.140 --> 00:22:36.820
Things finally came to a head in October,

393
00:22:36.910 --> 00:22:38.920
following a European summit on integration.

394
00:22:39.370 --> 00:22:41.860
Facture gave an angry speech in which she replied to the idea.

395
00:22:42.300 --> 00:22:44.490
<v 7>We, they shouted no, no.</v>

396
00:22:46.620 --> 00:22:48.330
<v 0>In response to the pro Europe cabinet member,</v>

397
00:22:48.960 --> 00:22:50.700
Jeffrey Howe resigned for such a measure. Man,

398
00:22:50.760 --> 00:22:52.830
his resignation speech was devastating.

399
00:22:52.860 --> 00:22:55.950
Concluding that the party needed to question it's all due to fascia.

400
00:22:56.190 --> 00:22:59.640
That's another time Patrick could have shrugged it off, but in 1990,

401
00:22:59.670 --> 00:23:03.900
with Paul tank's RANTES burning across the country and a pro European party fed

402
00:23:03.901 --> 00:23:07.740
up with a Euro skepticism. She was typist on November the 15th,

403
00:23:07.770 --> 00:23:11.850
the year of our conservative Michael Haston tine did what Fancher had herself

404
00:23:11.851 --> 00:23:15.840
done to Heath. All those years ago. He challenged her to a leadership contest.

405
00:23:15.841 --> 00:23:18.480
And when the results came in, factual was doomed.

406
00:23:18.720 --> 00:23:20.130
Although she got the most votes,

407
00:23:20.160 --> 00:23:23.790
it had been by a pitiable margin as the two headed into the second round.

408
00:23:23.880 --> 00:23:27.420
So the venture realized you have profound shock that she might lose.

409
00:23:27.540 --> 00:23:31.800
So she jumped before she was pushed at 7:30 AM on November the 22nd,

410
00:23:31.801 --> 00:23:34.770
1990 Margaret Thatcher resigned as prime minister.

411
00:23:34.980 --> 00:23:36.270
At the moment she stepped down.

412
00:23:36.300 --> 00:23:40.560
She was the longest continuously serving prime minister since 1827.

413
00:23:40.710 --> 00:23:44.370
She was also one of the two most influential post-war PMs setting,

414
00:23:44.371 --> 00:23:49.010
an economic that has pretty much lost it intact until today only Clement

415
00:23:49.011 --> 00:23:51.710
Attlee really comes close in terms of significance.

416
00:23:51.950 --> 00:23:56.450
And it was his long lasting post-war settlements that Thatcher ripped up. Yes,

417
00:23:56.600 --> 00:23:58.310
despite her continued significance,

418
00:23:58.340 --> 00:24:02.810
despite her achievements opening the door to future female leaders just spends

419
00:24:02.900 --> 00:24:05.600
her years out of office bitter and unhappy.

420
00:24:05.870 --> 00:24:10.730
She fumed over her betrayal by her party fumes over the creation of the EU

421
00:24:10.910 --> 00:24:13.130
with nowhere left to channel her prodigious energies.

422
00:24:13.131 --> 00:24:15.020
She turned inwards by two thousands.

423
00:24:15.110 --> 00:24:19.940
She was showing signs of the dementia that would soon consumer just as outsiders

424
00:24:19.941 --> 00:24:22.610
had consumed Harold Wilson before her, by the ends,

425
00:24:22.640 --> 00:24:26.810
the dementia rented her mute almost incapable of doing even the simplest action.

426
00:24:27.080 --> 00:24:31.220
It said she liked to spend our days staring at a painting of a Victorian hunting

427
00:24:31.221 --> 00:24:33.200
party. Not really doing anything,

428
00:24:33.440 --> 00:24:36.890
just watching the crowd of painted dogs for signs of life.

429
00:24:37.130 --> 00:24:40.220
Margaret Thatcher passed away on April the eighth, 2013,

430
00:24:40.370 --> 00:24:42.590
while the welds mourns the death of a great leader.

431
00:24:42.800 --> 00:24:44.270
The reaction in Britain itself,

432
00:24:44.360 --> 00:24:48.050
a town's devastated by her economic policies still haven't recovered.

433
00:24:48.560 --> 00:24:49.400
It was more mixed.

434
00:24:49.790 --> 00:24:53.270
That's why he is the number two record in the British chart was ding dong.

435
00:24:53.271 --> 00:24:55.730
The witch is dead yet for all the bile,

436
00:24:55.731 --> 00:24:59.210
many Egypt upon her for all the hatred she stirred up.

437
00:24:59.750 --> 00:25:01.580
His legacy is all around us.

438
00:25:01.760 --> 00:25:06.230
It's from a Euro skepticism that the forces grew that would unleash Brexit from

439
00:25:06.231 --> 00:25:07.790
her wave of deregulation.

440
00:25:08.000 --> 00:25:12.170
That today's city of London was created almost every facet of modern life that

441
00:25:12.470 --> 00:25:15.980
we Brits take for granted the depressed post-industrial towns,

442
00:25:15.981 --> 00:25:18.140
the special relationship with America,

443
00:25:18.200 --> 00:25:22.940
the lack of paralyzing French style strikes all have their roots and naturalism

444
00:25:23.270 --> 00:25:27.440
in the ends. Then the good and the bad of our legacy are impossible to separate.

445
00:25:27.620 --> 00:25:32.300
She was who she was with a blind faith to do both necessary things for Britain's

446
00:25:32.301 --> 00:25:37.010
future and to commit screw ups that still holding the nation to this day in a

447
00:25:37.011 --> 00:25:39.530
world without Maggie Thatcher, many would be worse off.

448
00:25:39.740 --> 00:25:44.330
Some would be better off, but all would be able to agree on one thing.

449
00:25:44.570 --> 00:25:48.320
They were living in a completely different world from us. One in which Britain,

450
00:25:48.380 --> 00:25:52.670
Europe, and the former nations of the Soviet union had very different fates.

451
00:25:52.820 --> 00:25:55.310
If greatness is measured purely in terms of impact,

452
00:25:55.610 --> 00:25:59.450
then that surely an exa one of the greatest prime ministers of all.

453
00:25:59.930 --> 00:26:02.660
