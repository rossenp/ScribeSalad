00:00:00.020 --> 00:00:04.040
<v 0>If you have a bit of a Bible to Matthew chapter two, verse 16 to 18,</v>

2
00:00:04.041 --> 00:00:07.720
you'll encounter one of the most notorious stories in any religion,

3
00:00:07.730 --> 00:00:11.000
suspicious of a prophecy about a new king hared, the great tricks,

4
00:00:11.001 --> 00:00:14.520
the ma into telling him where baby Jesus was born.

5
00:00:14.760 --> 00:00:18.920
Then he sends his soldiers to massacre every child under the age of two in

6
00:00:19.440 --> 00:00:21.870
Betham. It's a of shocking cruelty.

7
00:00:21.871 --> 00:00:26.550
One that has ensure that king herd's name is still synonymous with evil

8
00:00:26.940 --> 00:00:28.390
even to this day.

9
00:00:34.570 --> 00:00:39.470
But what if we told you there was more to her's story born in Southern Palestine

10
00:00:39.471 --> 00:00:40.270
in 73,

11
00:00:40.270 --> 00:00:44.740
BC herd was a man at the center of events that has shaped history.

12
00:00:44.880 --> 00:00:49.020
He was there when Rome was transformed from a Republic to an empire,

13
00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:52.820
he consulted with Julius Caesar. He befriended Mark Anthony,

14
00:00:53.200 --> 00:00:56.860
and he submitted to the rule of Augustus as king of Juda.

15
00:00:56.960 --> 00:00:58.300
He rebuilt the second temple,

16
00:00:58.670 --> 00:01:03.370
saved the Olympic games from bankruptcy and to protect Jewish power across the

17
00:01:03.371 --> 00:01:07.650
world. Yes, he died an unloved tyrant hated by his people,

18
00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:11.570
his name forever stains with the blood of the innocence.

19
00:01:11.800 --> 00:01:16.410
This in the video today is the story of how one great man became

20
00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:18.690
the tyrant of all history.

21
00:01:24.910 --> 00:01:27.080
When hero was born in 73 BC,

22
00:01:27.100 --> 00:01:30.320
it was a great time to be from a Jewish family,

23
00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:34.480
roughly a hundred years before a group of priests known as the Macabees had

24
00:01:34.481 --> 00:01:38.960
rebelled against the saluted empire and turned Jerusalem into an independent

25
00:01:38.961 --> 00:01:40.880
city state. For the first time in a long time,

26
00:01:40.881 --> 00:01:45.190
the Jews were beholden to no one that no one included the superpower of the era.

27
00:01:45.290 --> 00:01:50.190
And that was of course the mighty Roman Republic with whose blessing Juda kept

28
00:01:50.290 --> 00:01:52.790
its independence. But unfortunately for her,

29
00:01:52.970 --> 00:01:57.950
his family's Jewish roots weren't as clear cut as he might have liked the son of

30
00:01:57.951 --> 00:02:02.830
a wealthy ambitious man known as Anter herds was by birth part ed

31
00:02:03.130 --> 00:02:07.140
part Arab. Although his father's family had been practicing Jews for a century,

32
00:02:07.570 --> 00:02:10.100
they were still seen as outsiders in Judea,

33
00:02:10.340 --> 00:02:14.780
a stigma that kept the family from holding any power. But her's dad.

34
00:02:15.020 --> 00:02:17.180
Anti was nothing, if not ambitious.

35
00:02:17.480 --> 00:02:22.220
And there was no way that he was going to let his murky origins halt his

36
00:02:22.300 --> 00:02:24.090
family's rise. The year,

37
00:02:24.410 --> 00:02:29.370
her turned six and titer got his chance in 67 BC Alexandra

38
00:02:29.730 --> 00:02:31.130
solo, the queen of Judea died.

39
00:02:31.160 --> 00:02:35.930
Unfortunately she died without leaving a clear line of succession and her two

40
00:02:36.040 --> 00:02:39.130
sons, they elected to take their claims, the battlefield.

41
00:02:39.350 --> 00:02:44.010
And so it began the first of a series of war that are going to rack Judea

42
00:02:44.300 --> 00:02:47.480
for the rest of this video on one side was the Queen's son.

43
00:02:47.760 --> 00:02:52.320
Her Canus II on the other was her can's brother Aris, Dubus, spoiler alert.

44
00:02:52.620 --> 00:02:55.800
You only need to remember the, her Ranka guy as the organ underway.

45
00:02:56.000 --> 00:03:00.200
Her anus came to her's dad to beg for his support and ti agreed,

46
00:03:00.340 --> 00:03:02.960
but not because he thought hi anus was in the right,

47
00:03:03.140 --> 00:03:07.320
in their short meeting at titer realized just how weak and easy to manipulate hi

48
00:03:07.720 --> 00:03:08.960
anus was sounds well,

49
00:03:08.961 --> 00:03:13.240
what could be better than having a weak manipulable king on the throne?

50
00:03:13.590 --> 00:03:18.440
When he owes you a favor by 63 BC, the war was moving decisive,

51
00:03:19.350 --> 00:03:21.630
inherent favored in the temple.

52
00:03:22.200 --> 00:03:25.830
Ariss was fast running out of options faced with the imminent collapse of his

53
00:03:25.831 --> 00:03:26.950
claim to the throne.

54
00:03:27.520 --> 00:03:31.430
Ariss decided to roll everything on one crazy gamble.

55
00:03:31.810 --> 00:03:36.150
At the time that Roman general Poe was riding around the Eastern Mediterranean

56
00:03:36.200 --> 00:03:38.950
conquering. Well just about everything sight.

57
00:03:39.420 --> 00:03:43.980
So Ariss bang the general a massive bribe to invade Juda on his

58
00:03:44.480 --> 00:03:49.380
behalf. This well, it would turn out to be a rather hilariously bad move.

59
00:03:49.650 --> 00:03:53.140
When word arrived, Pompe moved his army on Jerusalem.

60
00:03:53.290 --> 00:03:57.700
<v 1>Then he assessed the situation and came to the conclusion that ABUS was going to</v>

61
00:03:57.701 --> 00:04:01.610
lose and pocketed ABUS and sided with Harus.

62
00:04:01.830 --> 00:04:06.090
In order to finally to defeat him amusing as this might be,

63
00:04:06.350 --> 00:04:11.130
it was also a major historical turning point in the wake of is' defeat,

64
00:04:11.340 --> 00:04:12.100
Pompe annex,

65
00:04:12.100 --> 00:04:16.690
large parts of the once independent Jue the then installed the victorious Hiran

66
00:04:16.950 --> 00:04:20.640
on the throne as a Roman client king us like that.

67
00:04:20.640 --> 00:04:24.960
<v 0>The era of an independent Jewish state, it came to a close in its place,</v>

68
00:04:25.130 --> 00:04:28.960
began an era of Jerusalem under the heel of Rome.

69
00:04:29.340 --> 00:04:32.040
Not everyone was upset by this though for Herod's dad.

70
00:04:32.080 --> 00:04:36.480
I Poe's intervention was like winning the lottery with Harran II in charge.

71
00:04:36.840 --> 00:04:40.160
IIB began happily cooperating with the new Roman authorities and establishing

72
00:04:40.161 --> 00:04:43.070
himself as the real power behind the throne.

73
00:04:43.490 --> 00:04:47.350
Not the population of Juda made this easy in 57 BC,

74
00:04:47.550 --> 00:04:48.830
an an Roman uprising,

75
00:04:49.090 --> 00:04:53.910
forced Angus and Anter to call the Roman army back in order to save

76
00:04:53.911 --> 00:04:54.744
their butts.

77
00:04:54.820 --> 00:04:59.430
This time was Mark Anthony that answered the call like Pompe before in Mark

78
00:04:59.430 --> 00:05:03.100
Anthony subdued Jerusalem, with these in the aftermath over the campaign,

79
00:05:03.101 --> 00:05:05.740
he was introduced to inhibitors now 16 year old son,

80
00:05:05.770 --> 00:05:09.300
despite being 10 years older than herd Mark Anthony hit it off with a boy.

81
00:05:09.320 --> 00:05:11.420
Pretty soon they were firm friends.

82
00:05:11.800 --> 00:05:16.420
It was a friendship that would soon make her the most powerful man in Juda.

83
00:05:22.680 --> 00:05:26.810
There's a peculiar curse that afflicts small states on the doorsteps of

84
00:05:26.811 --> 00:05:27.560
superpowers.

85
00:05:27.560 --> 00:05:31.210
Each time the winds of change ripple through the corridors of power,

86
00:05:31.230 --> 00:05:34.610
the smaller state has to hunker down in case everything it holds.

87
00:05:34.930 --> 00:05:39.690
Dear is simply blown away in Rome in 53 BC while a

88
00:05:39.691 --> 00:05:42.400
hurricane, it was a brewing years.

89
00:05:42.401 --> 00:05:46.520
The Republic had been under the sway of something called the first triumvirate.

90
00:05:46.680 --> 00:05:48.320
It's a collection of three great men,

91
00:05:48.580 --> 00:05:53.080
all hoping to one day become the undisputed rule. The first was Pompe,

92
00:05:53.100 --> 00:05:55.920
the old benefactor of Amita and Hiran us. The second,

93
00:05:56.140 --> 00:05:58.960
the second was a man known as crass. The third,

94
00:05:59.640 --> 00:06:02.000
well that was Julius Caesar in may 53,

95
00:06:02.240 --> 00:06:07.040
BC crass died ending the first tra with third part of their trio gone.

96
00:06:07.060 --> 00:06:11.640
It could only be so long before Cesar ends Pompe turned on one another in

97
00:06:11.641 --> 00:06:14.000
January 49 BC. Well,

98
00:06:14.030 --> 00:06:18.670
they did the civil war that ripped its way through the Roman Republic smashed

99
00:06:18.671 --> 00:06:21.750
apart old certainties everywhere in Jua,

100
00:06:21.950 --> 00:06:25.990
a presumably panicked anti Renzi Ranas were forced to choose who to throw their

101
00:06:25.991 --> 00:06:29.590
support behind Pompe. The man who had given them power or Caesar,

102
00:06:29.930 --> 00:06:33.990
the man mark an now fought for in the ends went for Caesar.

103
00:06:34.130 --> 00:06:35.750
It could have been a catastrophe.

104
00:06:35.751 --> 00:06:39.660
The first step along a long path attended with victorious Pompe,

105
00:06:39.661 --> 00:06:42.460
having antis entire family crucified.

106
00:06:42.730 --> 00:06:46.980
Instead though it became the making of them on August the ninth, 48,

107
00:06:47.240 --> 00:06:50.140
BC Caesar annihilated Poe's army. Uh,

108
00:06:50.160 --> 00:06:54.980
the battle of falis broken Pompe ran only to be assassinated later that year

109
00:06:55.200 --> 00:06:56.033
in the aftermath.

110
00:06:56.340 --> 00:07:00.930
You better believe all jewelry did not forget who his friends were in 47

111
00:07:01.210 --> 00:07:01.490
BC.

112
00:07:01.490 --> 00:07:05.890
<v 1>I was rewarded for ditching Pompe by being made pro curator or</v>

113
00:07:05.920 --> 00:07:08.690
financial governor of Juda. Not only that,

114
00:07:08.691 --> 00:07:10.730
but he was given Roman citizenship something.

115
00:07:10.731 --> 00:07:12.890
He was able to pass on his son and IDI.

116
00:07:13.350 --> 00:07:17.330
He had big plans for his new citizen son, bad, same yep.

117
00:07:17.380 --> 00:07:18.560
40 BC.

118
00:07:18.561 --> 00:07:23.000
And tippe pulled some strings and had the 26 year old her made governor of

119
00:07:23.070 --> 00:07:23.590
Galilee.

120
00:07:23.590 --> 00:07:27.240
<v 0>This was the first time the ancient world got a good look at the sort of ruler</v>

121
00:07:27.241 --> 00:07:29.760
that her would be the results. Well,

122
00:07:29.830 --> 00:07:34.480
they were as shocking as you might be expecting as the governor of Galilee

123
00:07:34.690 --> 00:07:39.190
her's first task was to take care of some partisans who were hiding and caves,

124
00:07:39.191 --> 00:07:43.590
trying to overthrow the re backed state and calling themselves new Macabees.

125
00:07:44.030 --> 00:07:47.630
Everyone expected herd to wage a conventional war. Instead,

126
00:07:47.690 --> 00:07:49.670
the new governor located the cave system,

127
00:07:49.671 --> 00:07:53.030
the rebels were hiding in sentence soldiers with the orders to massacre

128
00:07:53.390 --> 00:07:55.070
everyone. It was a day of bloodshed,

129
00:07:55.290 --> 00:07:58.350
so great that it triggered riots in Jerusalem.

130
00:07:58.630 --> 00:08:02.220
Her was hauled before the religious authorities and threatened with death for

131
00:08:02.221 --> 00:08:06.980
his actions, but herd stood his ground before the highest priests of Judaism.

132
00:08:07.240 --> 00:08:10.700
He asserted his right as governor to deal with rebels. As he saw fit,

133
00:08:10.930 --> 00:08:12.620
including wholesale murder,

134
00:08:13.170 --> 00:08:18.140
despite his brutality herd was let off free escaping the death

135
00:08:18.141 --> 00:08:18.940
penalty.

136
00:08:18.940 --> 00:08:23.170
It was the first major scandal that he was implicated in that it certainly

137
00:08:23.171 --> 00:08:24.570
wouldn't be the last,

138
00:08:30.910 --> 00:08:35.810
If the people of Jude were hoping that the days of political shockwaves from

139
00:08:35.960 --> 00:08:39.850
Rome, battering them senseless were over well events,

140
00:08:40.010 --> 00:08:44.680
Sue improved otherwise just three years after one civil war propelled her and

141
00:08:44.960 --> 00:08:45.840
anti titer to the top.

142
00:08:46.070 --> 00:08:50.760
Another came along that threatens to destroy them on March the 15th 44

143
00:08:51.100 --> 00:08:56.040
BC Julius Caesar was assassinated in Rome by Brutus and Cassius that

144
00:08:56.520 --> 00:09:00.720
Deone the two traders fled to the east of the Republic back in the eternal city,

145
00:09:01.160 --> 00:09:02.280
mark Anza and Caesars nephew,

146
00:09:02.600 --> 00:09:06.400
Octa declared a new war in order to exterminate the assassins.

147
00:09:06.401 --> 00:09:08.960
Unfortunately for Judea, this meant once again,

148
00:09:09.280 --> 00:09:13.160
being caught right in the middle of things from his new power base in the east,

149
00:09:13.350 --> 00:09:17.950
Cassius ordered all ovens is to pay for his war against mark Ansy and Octavian.

150
00:09:18.020 --> 00:09:22.670
That meant Juda coughing up 15,000 kilograms of silver or

151
00:09:22.930 --> 00:09:27.870
its inhabitants being put to the sword as prorated. The job of collecting money.

152
00:09:28.140 --> 00:09:30.830
Well, that fell to anti's possible to read.

153
00:09:31.430 --> 00:09:35.980
Anti's willingness to cooperate with Cassius is a way of protecting her buts.

154
00:09:35.981 --> 00:09:38.660
Given what we know about anti's opportunism,

155
00:09:39.170 --> 00:09:42.580
it's just as easy you imagine that it fit his loyalties. Once again,

156
00:09:42.730 --> 00:09:45.780
like a weasel playing BOS and the people of Juda,

157
00:09:45.781 --> 00:09:50.620
they certainly saw it as the latter in 43 BC, one of anti's own tax collectors.

158
00:09:51.000 --> 00:09:54.780
He assassinated him when her got news that his father had been killed.

159
00:09:54.781 --> 00:09:58.010
He flew in into a rage with permission from Cassius as forces.

160
00:09:58.070 --> 00:10:00.570
He tracked down the assassin and murdered him.

161
00:10:00.790 --> 00:10:05.530
It could easily have been herd's last ever active violence in 42

162
00:10:05.870 --> 00:10:06.570
BC, mark,

163
00:10:06.570 --> 00:10:11.330
Anthony and Octavian now formed into the second Trium alongside Marcus Amelia's

164
00:10:11.770 --> 00:10:15.170
lapis defeated Cassius and Brutus with the war over mark,

165
00:10:15.410 --> 00:10:20.080
an went warrior to avenging angel riding across the provinces that had supported

166
00:10:20.150 --> 00:10:24.160
Cassius and leaving death and destruction in his wake.

167
00:10:24.470 --> 00:10:26.520
This should have been bad news for her.

168
00:10:26.760 --> 00:10:31.680
He was suddenly stuck with explaining why I had leaped in due bed with Cassius,

169
00:10:31.820 --> 00:10:36.280
but her had apparently picked up a trick or two from his old man.

170
00:10:36.650 --> 00:10:39.950
He told the avenging angel one, the course daddy had to support.

171
00:10:40.180 --> 00:10:44.990
Cassius he'd have destroyed G dare if he didn't. But I mean, honestly, bro,

172
00:10:45.330 --> 00:10:48.790
we always wanted you to win. You know that right? You were always our guy,

173
00:10:49.250 --> 00:10:52.630
how true this was debatable, but Mark Anthony,

174
00:10:52.770 --> 00:10:56.870
he trusted his old friendship with her just enough to buy it rather than kill.

175
00:10:57.080 --> 00:11:02.020
He made her Tera of Galilee it's ruler and he also made her's brother

176
00:11:02.450 --> 00:11:03.580
Tera of Jerusalem.

177
00:11:03.581 --> 00:11:08.260
Suddenly Harran is II was reduced to a figurehead real power in Juda.

178
00:11:08.600 --> 00:11:11.420
Now lay in the hands of anti's sons.

179
00:11:11.421 --> 00:11:15.060
This turned out to be a pretty hard sell for Judas population.

180
00:11:15.460 --> 00:11:17.810
Remember her's family was seen as not really J Jewish,

181
00:11:17.990 --> 00:11:21.530
but rather fake Jews who got into bed with the hated Romans.

182
00:11:21.930 --> 00:11:25.530
So when some dudes called the IANS suddenly attacked in 40 BC,

183
00:11:25.720 --> 00:11:28.770
most Jews decided to side with them. Amid fighting.

184
00:11:29.010 --> 00:11:30.690
He ranks II was put in chains,

185
00:11:30.850 --> 00:11:35.210
had his ear sliced off and was dragged away to captivity in battle on her's

186
00:11:35.211 --> 00:11:35.390
brother,

187
00:11:35.390 --> 00:11:39.880
the Tetra of Jerusalem committed suicide than face the same fate over the three

188
00:11:39.881 --> 00:11:43.920
rulers of jute. Only her escaped as the paren rampage,

189
00:11:44.100 --> 00:11:48.880
he ran to the only safe place he could think of Rome in the eternal

190
00:11:48.910 --> 00:11:52.240
city. Heroed was forced to beg the second Traver for help.

191
00:11:52.640 --> 00:11:57.520
Mark Anton and Octavia. They listened and they finally agreed on one condition.

192
00:11:58.080 --> 00:12:01.920
Herd would have to prove himself worthy by retaking Jerusalem.

193
00:12:02.060 --> 00:12:02.920
For the next three years,

194
00:12:03.360 --> 00:12:07.000
herd led a Roman army against the Pathan Papa government ruling Juda,

195
00:12:07.180 --> 00:12:08.040
the bitters of civil war.

196
00:12:08.060 --> 00:12:12.240
It claims many lives and it ruins herd's reputation further among the Jewish

197
00:12:12.440 --> 00:12:13.273
part population,

198
00:12:13.690 --> 00:12:18.230
but it worked in 37 BC Jerusalem fell and hero road into the city

199
00:12:18.830 --> 00:12:21.830
aged just 36 hero had done. It had taken back.

200
00:12:21.860 --> 00:12:25.590
What was his improved himself worthy to his Roman clients?

201
00:12:25.900 --> 00:12:29.510
That same year he had his highest on a yet bestowed upon him no longer would

202
00:12:29.670 --> 00:12:34.380
hero me be Tero of Galilee ruling alongside another te Akins figurehead like

203
00:12:35.100 --> 00:12:38.460
Angus. Rather from this point on, there would only be one title buffeting,

204
00:12:38.700 --> 00:12:42.820
a warrior like her. He would be a king of Judea

205
00:12:49.110 --> 00:12:49.461
Her's.

206
00:12:49.461 --> 00:12:53.770
First few years on the throne was spent trying to desperately apply Avene of

207
00:12:54.100 --> 00:12:56.970
legitimacy to his rule. This meant divorcing his first wife,

208
00:12:56.971 --> 00:12:59.010
banishing her from court and remarrying,

209
00:12:59.050 --> 00:13:02.810
a woman named Marianne who just happened to be a princess from an old ruling

210
00:13:03.040 --> 00:13:03.630
dynasty.

211
00:13:03.630 --> 00:13:08.530
It also meant begging the now defeated paths to send Harus thei back

212
00:13:08.531 --> 00:13:11.250
from Babylon. This might seem like an odd choice.

213
00:13:11.850 --> 00:13:15.040
Harus was the only other guy around with a legitimate do hers throne.

214
00:13:15.041 --> 00:13:19.040
Unfortunately for hero though, the captured king was still popular in G day.

215
00:13:19.180 --> 00:13:23.840
So herd arranged to have Harran brought back and treated with the utmost respect

216
00:13:23.841 --> 00:13:28.440
on the unspoken condition that Harran go arounds being all like, you know, gee,

217
00:13:28.441 --> 00:13:31.840
this, her guy super great king, right? We should probably do what this guy says,

218
00:13:32.050 --> 00:13:34.480
right guys, right with this done hers.

219
00:13:34.730 --> 00:13:37.470
He went about winning over the popule over the next five years,

220
00:13:37.471 --> 00:13:41.270
he built massive new city walls for Jerusalem and a brand new Citadel to protect

221
00:13:41.330 --> 00:13:44.750
the temple named Anir B Mark Anthony. Naturally,

222
00:13:44.850 --> 00:13:49.070
he even had mented showing himself alongside traditional Jewish objects just to

223
00:13:49.071 --> 00:13:51.390
hammer home. The points that he really really was Jewish king,

224
00:13:51.830 --> 00:13:56.020
but as we've already seen time and a gay in this video,

225
00:13:56.440 --> 00:13:59.900
the fate of Juda, rulers, it was not decided in Juda,

226
00:14:00.320 --> 00:14:02.740
but rather off in Rome and Rome,

227
00:14:03.000 --> 00:14:07.180
it was gearing up for yet another civil war in 33 BC.

228
00:14:07.181 --> 00:14:11.380
The second triumvirate went to the way of the first Trivers and onerously

229
00:14:11.490 --> 00:14:15.380
collapsed to years after that 31 BC Y Dian a mark.

230
00:14:15.670 --> 00:14:18.450
He decided to fight each other to the death for hers.

231
00:14:18.451 --> 00:14:21.850
This was the first time that he found himself caught between two Roman factions

232
00:14:21.851 --> 00:14:23.570
without Anter around.

233
00:14:23.960 --> 00:14:28.370
This was a problem because her lacked anti wily political instincts,

234
00:14:28.371 --> 00:14:32.210
while his father had been happy to chuckled allies like Pompe and Caesar,

235
00:14:32.570 --> 00:14:34.050
when he thought the winds were lying against them,

236
00:14:34.530 --> 00:14:39.080
her was just a bit loyal to his friends as the armies of

237
00:14:39.400 --> 00:14:42.800
octane. And Anthony gathered hared through his lot in with Anthony.

238
00:14:43.360 --> 00:14:47.160
And you can probably guess at this point where this is going on September the

239
00:14:47.320 --> 00:14:48.153
second 31,

240
00:14:48.260 --> 00:14:53.080
BC octane demolished Anthony's forces at the battle of a Anthony was forced to

241
00:14:53.081 --> 00:14:54.600
flee into hiding where he, Claire,

242
00:14:54.840 --> 00:14:59.480
Patrick committed suicide at the same very time as summons landed on her's desk,

243
00:14:59.481 --> 00:15:03.000
calling him to roads to explain himself to Octa. Now,

244
00:15:03.020 --> 00:15:07.080
if you've ever that to go before your boss, after making some colossal mistake,

245
00:15:07.380 --> 00:15:11.750
you may have the faintest inkling of what her was feeling on that long and

246
00:15:11.930 --> 00:15:16.630
lonely Boatright like when he had to explain anti's actions to Mark Anthony Hert

247
00:15:16.631 --> 00:15:21.030
had no friendship with Octavia that he could fall back on worse as a guy who had

248
00:15:21.031 --> 00:15:25.910
literally named citadels after Anthony herd was intimately connected to

249
00:15:26.230 --> 00:15:27.031
Octavia's enemy.

250
00:15:27.031 --> 00:15:30.630
Perhaps it says something of herd's state of minds that his last act before

251
00:15:30.631 --> 00:15:34.540
leaving Juda was to execute. Harrans. I second, that way,

252
00:15:34.541 --> 00:15:38.660
if hero was executed in turn, at least the throne would stay in his family,

253
00:15:39.000 --> 00:15:42.780
but it turns out hero really could be as Wiley Asita.

254
00:15:43.010 --> 00:15:45.940
Once in Rhodes hero didn't even bother trying to lie.

255
00:15:46.080 --> 00:15:50.300
He boldly told Octavia that he had supported mark Antony to the death that had

256
00:15:50.301 --> 00:15:55.290
been loyal to the general or for decades and would remain loyal even now Orian

257
00:15:55.291 --> 00:15:58.810
listened. And when her was done, presumably he gave him a rise. Smile.

258
00:15:59.010 --> 00:16:02.850
The for saying that herd's loyalty was a far more useful asset to Rome than

259
00:16:02.851 --> 00:16:05.330
someone who had trying and worm their way out of trouble.

260
00:16:05.470 --> 00:16:10.170
He then reconfirmed her as the king of ju dare is pretty hard to imagine what

261
00:16:10.171 --> 00:16:13.560
would've been going through. Hero's mind on that boat, right home. I mean,

262
00:16:13.561 --> 00:16:16.000
against all odds, his truth telling gamble,

263
00:16:16.300 --> 00:16:20.280
it had absolutely paid off Octavian might not exactly trust him,

264
00:16:20.380 --> 00:16:22.400
but he certainly respected him at least.

265
00:16:22.500 --> 00:16:27.400
And in Octavia's good books was exactly where the king of Judea wanted

266
00:16:27.420 --> 00:16:28.253
to be.

267
00:16:28.440 --> 00:16:31.520
Some three years after the meeting in Rhode Octavian finally completed his

268
00:16:31.521 --> 00:16:35.710
takeover of him in Republic. He took the name that history today knows him by,

269
00:16:36.090 --> 00:16:37.790
and that is Augustus.

270
00:16:38.000 --> 00:16:41.950
After half a century of bloodshed Rome transformation into an empire,

271
00:16:42.410 --> 00:16:43.590
it was finally complete

272
00:16:49.780 --> 00:16:52.910
With the drum of the Empire's creation. Out of the way,

273
00:16:53.540 --> 00:16:58.220
hero was able to finally settle into actually ruling Juda between

274
00:16:58.221 --> 00:16:59.940
27 and 20 BC.

275
00:16:59.941 --> 00:17:04.140
He built up an image of himself as a sort of pagan Jewish ruler. One,

276
00:17:04.141 --> 00:17:08.580
he hoped would appeal to both Judas population and also his re backers.

277
00:17:08.820 --> 00:17:11.660
Plus if neither side was ever really convinced by herd's posing,

278
00:17:11.661 --> 00:17:14.330
they couldn't ignore his real achievements.

279
00:17:14.590 --> 00:17:18.810
As king of Juda hero spent his time building new staff like Bob,

280
00:17:18.950 --> 00:17:23.410
the builder on cocaine, Jerusalem. He got a new Amit, a market raw palace,

281
00:17:23.510 --> 00:17:27.850
and a ton of new homes to replace those that were destroyed by an earthquake new

282
00:17:28.490 --> 00:17:31.330
AUCs brought fresh water into the city on the fringes of Judea,

283
00:17:31.640 --> 00:17:34.320
huge new fortres were being built to protect the kingdom.

284
00:17:34.630 --> 00:17:39.200
Some of these such as Masada are still extinct and impressive.

285
00:17:39.590 --> 00:17:42.560
Then there was the money spent abroad shoring up Judas image,

286
00:17:42.580 --> 00:17:46.680
iconic cities like Damascus and Beru were given her sponsored makeovers.

287
00:17:46.790 --> 00:17:50.720
When the Olympic games was gonna go bankrupt herd in and he saved it.

288
00:17:50.990 --> 00:17:54.880
This launch was accompanied by an unmistakable increase in Juda,

289
00:17:54.930 --> 00:17:57.880
power Augustus, twice visited her in Jerusalem.

290
00:17:57.881 --> 00:18:01.640
And each time he handed over Newland to the king in 20 BC,

291
00:18:01.641 --> 00:18:04.440
Judea had expanded to include swaths of modern Syria,

292
00:18:04.630 --> 00:18:09.550
Lebanon and Jordan as Judas prestige grew in Rome took notice

293
00:18:10.030 --> 00:18:13.550
soon Jerusalem was flooded with Roman playwrights, historians and philosophers,

294
00:18:13.551 --> 00:18:15.830
all eager to see the booming city state.

295
00:18:16.170 --> 00:18:19.310
And you better believe hero tried to use this power for good.

296
00:18:19.490 --> 00:18:22.070
He was a vocal defender of Jews living in other states,

297
00:18:22.071 --> 00:18:26.750
often going out of his way to appease their Gentile hosts. But of course,

298
00:18:26.860 --> 00:18:28.470
this is still heroed.

299
00:18:28.471 --> 00:18:32.700
We're talking about here underneath all of this glitz and glamor lurk,

300
00:18:33.060 --> 00:18:34.660
a dark side on the streets.

301
00:18:35.100 --> 00:18:39.300
Ordinary Duan were suffering enormous tax burdens to pay for her's projects.

302
00:18:39.440 --> 00:18:40.061
On top of that,

303
00:18:40.061 --> 00:18:44.580
there were uneasy questions hovering over her's Jewishness with his fondness for

304
00:18:44.710 --> 00:18:45.061
pagan,

305
00:18:45.061 --> 00:18:49.420
Roman things many believed in Jerusalem that that ruler was secretly trying to

306
00:18:49.930 --> 00:18:50.930
sabotaged their culture.

307
00:18:51.350 --> 00:18:54.090
Not that it was all bad for ordinary men and women though,

308
00:18:54.091 --> 00:18:56.770
during the horrific famine of 25 to 24 BC,

309
00:18:56.771 --> 00:19:01.130
it was herd's Roman contact that stopped the disaster by arranging huge

310
00:19:01.160 --> 00:19:03.250
shipments of grain to ju dare.

311
00:19:03.350 --> 00:19:07.970
But it wasn't until 20 BC that heroed made his greatest attempt to win Jewish

312
00:19:08.110 --> 00:19:08.870
hearts.

313
00:19:08.870 --> 00:19:13.360
He decided to bills the second temple way back in 519

314
00:19:13.660 --> 00:19:13.881
BC,

315
00:19:13.881 --> 00:19:17.600
the Neo Babylonians had destroyed the first temple a replacement had been bills,

316
00:19:17.700 --> 00:19:21.000
but it was definitely let's say modest under hers.

317
00:19:21.001 --> 00:19:22.520
That was about to change though.

318
00:19:22.570 --> 00:19:26.680
Everything you think of when you think of Jerusalem's temple was a result of

319
00:19:26.910 --> 00:19:28.840
hers, construction spree, the sweeping walls,

320
00:19:29.030 --> 00:19:33.110
vast towers and great yard covering the temple mouse all came into being because

321
00:19:33.111 --> 00:19:36.670
of Hart, the famous Western wall. You can see standing today. Yep.

322
00:19:36.850 --> 00:19:38.070
That's another her project.

323
00:19:38.450 --> 00:19:41.550
Not that there's grand's new temple modified everyone.

324
00:19:42.030 --> 00:19:43.030
Hart kitted out with too many.

325
00:19:43.031 --> 00:19:47.310
Roman touches too many architectural nods to Judas Imperial LORs,

326
00:19:47.730 --> 00:19:52.100
nor did he take criticism kindly when a small sector of radical Jews tore down a

327
00:19:52.101 --> 00:19:56.140
Roman Eagle symbol from the new temple, her had them all burned alive.

328
00:19:56.550 --> 00:20:00.020
Still that's her entered the last decade of his life in 14 BC,

329
00:20:00.200 --> 00:20:04.180
the signs were all there that he might go down in history as not so bad.

330
00:20:04.220 --> 00:20:08.020
A ruler. Indeed. He might even have lived up to his billing of herd. The great,

331
00:20:08.520 --> 00:20:13.130
but you and I both know that there is one final act to come.

332
00:20:19.350 --> 00:20:23.250
One of the fascinating things about hero is that despite still being a household

333
00:20:23.610 --> 00:20:24.930
name 2000 years later,

334
00:20:25.190 --> 00:20:29.730
he often feels like he was only ever a bit player in two major stories for most

335
00:20:29.731 --> 00:20:31.970
of his life. The story Herod appeared in was the epic novel,

336
00:20:32.420 --> 00:20:35.080
the rise of the Roman empire. But as he ended old age,

337
00:20:35.140 --> 00:20:39.800
the king of Juda found himself cast as the villain in an even more famous tale.

338
00:20:40.060 --> 00:20:43.160
That's right. It's about time that we talked about Jesus.

339
00:20:44.190 --> 00:20:48.440
There's a bit of a debate about when Christ's birthday actually was with it.

340
00:20:48.441 --> 00:20:52.440
Generally being agreed that it's somewhere from six BC to four BC,

341
00:20:52.441 --> 00:20:54.640
whichever is true by the time Christ was born.

342
00:20:54.900 --> 00:20:57.040
Hero's rule was in a very bad place.

343
00:20:57.260 --> 00:21:01.600
The trouble had really started in 10 BC when hero had waged war against the

344
00:21:02.280 --> 00:21:02.460
naans.

345
00:21:02.460 --> 00:21:06.990
And so screwed up the campaign that had fallen from or Augustus faith that this

346
00:21:06.991 --> 00:21:11.950
sudden demoted status seems to have triggered a crisis of paranoia in the king

347
00:21:12.180 --> 00:21:16.350
convinced supporters of the dead he ranks II were plotting in the shadows hero,

348
00:21:16.440 --> 00:21:19.550
began a ruthless campaign to root out suspected enemies.

349
00:21:19.990 --> 00:21:21.870
He had already put his wife Maryam near to death,

350
00:21:21.890 --> 00:21:24.990
but now he also had her brother, mother, grandfather,

351
00:21:25.250 --> 00:21:27.420
and children all killed her,

352
00:21:27.610 --> 00:21:31.540
even had two of his own sons and titer and Arista Bulu executed.

353
00:21:31.610 --> 00:21:32.660
When Augustus hurt,

354
00:21:32.800 --> 00:21:36.980
he joked it would be safer to be her's pet pig than one of his sons,

355
00:21:37.280 --> 00:21:40.340
nor were those outside of her's court. Safe. In his last years,

356
00:21:40.620 --> 00:21:43.780
her had hundreds of ordinary Judas thrown in Dungeons and tortured.

357
00:21:43.880 --> 00:21:47.770
He masterminded gruesome public executions to keep order rumors started the

358
00:21:48.010 --> 00:21:49.130
swell that had defiled,

359
00:21:49.190 --> 00:21:52.610
the tombs of David and Solomon that had taken nine wives,

360
00:21:52.890 --> 00:21:54.370
defiance of Jewish customs.

361
00:21:54.850 --> 00:21:58.490
Although there were still TRAs such as the opening of herd's great new port city

362
00:21:59.210 --> 00:22:00.250
CRE in nine BC,

363
00:22:00.251 --> 00:22:04.450
but they were all overshadowed by a cloud of paranoia that was hanging over to

364
00:22:04.610 --> 00:22:05.051
dare it.

365
00:22:05.051 --> 00:22:09.200
Wasn't held by a horrific illness that the king contract is that eight aways

366
00:22:09.520 --> 00:22:12.320
flesh, which is thought day to be EZ gang green.

367
00:22:12.660 --> 00:22:16.880
The disease left her so mad that he gave insane orders from the mass execution

368
00:22:16.881 --> 00:22:21.000
of 300 soldiers to a demands that Al GDE and Nobles be dragged to an

369
00:22:21.560 --> 00:22:23.880
amphitheater on his death and then shot full of arrows.

370
00:22:24.020 --> 00:22:27.720
It was against this dark background that AEC of Jewish scholars suddenly

371
00:22:27.721 --> 00:22:30.830
announced the time of the Messiah was almost upon them.

372
00:22:31.010 --> 00:22:33.870
And so we come to her's most infamous legacy.

373
00:22:34.100 --> 00:22:38.990
Matthew chapter two verse 16 to 18 tells us that hared became worried about

374
00:22:39.010 --> 00:22:40.350
the prophesized Messiah.

375
00:22:40.360 --> 00:22:45.110
Eventually ordering every child under two in Behem to be put to death

376
00:22:45.320 --> 00:22:46.870
known as the massacre of the innocence,

377
00:22:47.030 --> 00:22:48.790
the killing his controversial among historians,

378
00:22:49.060 --> 00:22:51.700
because it only appears in Matthew's gospel.

379
00:22:52.120 --> 00:22:56.060
The other gospels don't mention it nor to the accounts of Josephus or Nicholas

380
00:22:56.120 --> 00:22:57.020
of Damascus.

381
00:22:57.110 --> 00:23:01.060
Still from what we know of hero's mental state in his last few years,

382
00:23:01.061 --> 00:23:04.900
having a bunch of random babies killed would certainly have been completely in

383
00:23:04.901 --> 00:23:06.100
character. Thankfully,

384
00:23:06.160 --> 00:23:10.690
the massacre would be the last awful thing that the king of drew ever did

385
00:23:11.030 --> 00:23:14.890
in four BC herd. The great finally passed away in Jericho.

386
00:23:14.891 --> 00:23:18.930
This was only a handful of months after a failed suicide attempt. Traditionally,

387
00:23:19.190 --> 00:23:22.170
its thought he died in March, although no one really knows for sure.

388
00:23:22.300 --> 00:23:26.210
After his passing Augustus decree, Judea would be split into three parts.

389
00:23:26.510 --> 00:23:30.960
The Kings that her had helped create, it was no more in the ends.

390
00:23:31.060 --> 00:23:36.000
The life of her was defined less by who he was than by those who

391
00:23:36.120 --> 00:23:39.560
were around him. The lives of Julius Caesar, Mark Anthony Augustus.

392
00:23:39.700 --> 00:23:44.320
And of course, Jesus continue to fascinate us even now to millennia later,

393
00:23:44.540 --> 00:23:48.840
to have been part of all their stories is a remarkable achievement in itself.

394
00:23:49.070 --> 00:23:51.440
Even if her may not have seen it that way.

395
00:23:51.780 --> 00:23:56.200
The poem Aussie mens by Percy Shelley tells us of a traveler who finds a great

396
00:23:56.201 --> 00:24:00.240
broken statue of some king in the middle of a desert. Now the statue's pedestal.

397
00:24:00.241 --> 00:24:03.920
It declares look on my works. You mighty and despair.

398
00:24:04.510 --> 00:24:08.390
There is nothing left of this dead. King's deeds, no hints of his life.

399
00:24:08.900 --> 00:24:12.030
Just endless sand in the desert of history.

400
00:24:12.140 --> 00:24:17.070
It's tempting to think the same has come of hero with his name still only

401
00:24:17.340 --> 00:24:21.950
just about visible, thanks to a single verse in a single book of the Bible.

402
00:24:22.290 --> 00:24:24.350
But as this video has hopefully shown,

403
00:24:24.351 --> 00:24:28.060
there was more to the life of her than one horrific act.

404
00:24:28.240 --> 00:24:32.460
He may not have been a good man or even a particularly clever man, but herd.

405
00:24:32.461 --> 00:24:34.420
The great was certainly one thing.

406
00:24:34.840 --> 00:24:39.180
He was a man worth remembering. So I really hope you found that video.

407
00:24:39.540 --> 00:24:42.140
