1
00:00:00.210 --> 00:00:03.330
<v 0>You know the saying behind every great man is a great woman. Well,</v>

2
00:00:03.340 --> 00:00:06.930
it also applies to men who are the exact opposite of great.

3
00:00:07.020 --> 00:00:09.930
Jen Ching was the fourth wife of chairman Mao Zedong,

4
00:00:09.931 --> 00:00:13.620
the man who oversaw one of history's deadliest Brigham's,

5
00:00:13.770 --> 00:00:15.780
but rather than merely supporting her husband,

6
00:00:15.840 --> 00:00:20.670
Jang was an active participant in his atrocities as a key member of the cultural

7
00:00:20.671 --> 00:00:21.540
revolution group.

8
00:00:21.550 --> 00:00:26.040
She dragged China into a decade of chaos that kills up to 2 million people.

9
00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:27.990
She pursued spiteful, vendettas,

10
00:00:27.991 --> 00:00:31.380
ordering the murders of people who had snubbed her decades.

11
00:00:31.381 --> 00:00:35.850
Before I said 1980 trial, she famously described herself as a mouse attack,

12
00:00:35.851 --> 00:00:39.840
dog declaring whomever. He said to bite. I bet,

13
00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:43.500
but while Jen Ching ended her life a revolutionary psychopath,

14
00:00:43.650 --> 00:00:46.440
she certainly didn't start it that way. There's a young woman.

15
00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:48.240
Jang had been a movie starlet.

16
00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:51.770
She had had affairs appeared in tabloids and engaged in behaviors.

17
00:00:51.771 --> 00:00:55.230
So scandalous, the communist party wanted nothing to do with her yet.

18
00:00:55.231 --> 00:00:59.760
Somehow she Rose to the top of that same party ushering in an era of

19
00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:04.530
unparalleled chaos. Join us as we explore the life of Jen Ching,

20
00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:07.710
the architect of the cultural revolution,

21
00:01:19.960 --> 00:01:23.030
Just the slightest tweaking gen Ching story could have been a Hollywood

22
00:01:23.031 --> 00:01:27.470
fairytale born in March, 1914. The girl grew up in heartbreaking poverty.

23
00:01:27.650 --> 00:01:30.530
Her mother was a concubine and her father a landowning drunk.

24
00:01:30.531 --> 00:01:34.940
You seem to be competing for the title. Most toxic purveyor of masculinity.

25
00:01:35.030 --> 00:01:38.900
He beads both women so frequently that the girl eventually snaps into age just

26
00:01:38.901 --> 00:01:40.520
14. She ran away from home.

27
00:01:40.760 --> 00:01:45.260
It would be thanks to this escape that the girl discovered her true love acting

28
00:01:45.500 --> 00:01:46.190
incidentally,

29
00:01:46.190 --> 00:01:50.990
the girl wasn't called Chan chin yet over her life should go by many names and

30
00:01:50.991 --> 00:01:55.940
it's just by luck. This Jen Ching eventually stuck before she became Jang.

31
00:01:55.941 --> 00:01:57.800
Though, the girl would live a very different life.

32
00:01:57.890 --> 00:01:59.330
After a year with an acting troupe.

33
00:01:59.360 --> 00:02:03.590
The girls signed up with a brand new experimental arts Academy in Shang dong,

34
00:02:03.650 --> 00:02:07.010
graduating in 1933. She headed straight for Shanghai.

35
00:02:07.100 --> 00:02:11.360
It was almost the perfect time to be a 19 year old actress in East Asia's

36
00:02:11.361 --> 00:02:13.130
Hollywood. Just a couple of years earlier,

37
00:02:13.131 --> 00:02:17.450
the nationalist Cuming Tang and the Chenko shattered reunited China after nearly

38
00:02:17.451 --> 00:02:19.490
two decades of warlord chaos.

39
00:02:19.670 --> 00:02:22.670
Now with China in the throws of the Nanjing decades,

40
00:02:22.820 --> 00:02:27.380
peace and prosperity artificially resends well, they had, for some people,

41
00:02:27.381 --> 00:02:31.760
at least Shanghai in 1933 was deeply unequal. The rich were rich.

42
00:02:31.790 --> 00:02:36.110
The poor were destitute and left wing radicalism suffused the app.

43
00:02:36.230 --> 00:02:38.150
Although the girl noticed at first,

44
00:02:38.300 --> 00:02:41.180
she was too focused on living out our Shanghai dreams.

45
00:02:41.240 --> 00:02:44.600
Although Jangs early years in the city was spends in minor ranks in groups.

46
00:02:44.750 --> 00:02:48.230
She was still beautiful and hedonistic enough to party with the rich and famous.

47
00:02:48.440 --> 00:02:49.580
She drank like a fish,

48
00:02:49.610 --> 00:02:52.820
got herself swept up in scandals and chased her big break.

49
00:02:52.850 --> 00:02:56.240
She even was jailed for three months. So having one States to communist,

50
00:02:56.270 --> 00:03:00.130
but what did it matter? Really? This was all just part of a story.

51
00:03:00.131 --> 00:03:03.340
The tale of how one girl from a miserable backgrounds,

52
00:03:03.490 --> 00:03:06.400
Rose to become China's greatest stop.

53
00:03:06.490 --> 00:03:10.060
And Jangs star really was rising in 1934.

54
00:03:10.061 --> 00:03:14.710
She translated a breakout role than a Henrik Ibsen play into a contract to

55
00:03:14.711 --> 00:03:16.450
produce films with a left wing company.

56
00:03:16.570 --> 00:03:20.890
She changed an interland ping or blue Apple and prepared to embark on her

57
00:03:21.610 --> 00:03:21.640
fairytale,

58
00:03:21.640 --> 00:03:25.350
but already the cold wind of reality was beginning to seep in that same year,

59
00:03:25.380 --> 00:03:30.010
the communists 46,000 kilometer retreat from combing Tang forces known as the

60
00:03:30.011 --> 00:03:31.900
long March, both the parties,

61
00:03:32.020 --> 00:03:36.340
foundational myth and the events that made now it's undisputed leader.

62
00:03:36.400 --> 00:03:40.150
It was the first sign of the radical change that would soon sweep China,

63
00:03:40.300 --> 00:03:42.760
even blue Apple noticed then Shanghai.

64
00:03:42.761 --> 00:03:46.060
She began appearing in socially conscious films come 1936.

65
00:03:46.480 --> 00:03:50.920
Jan was reveling in both our growing roles and to tabloid already in love life.

66
00:03:51.040 --> 00:03:52.900
She had a melodramatic affair with a critic.

67
00:03:53.080 --> 00:03:55.240
This ended with him trying to kill himself, not once,

68
00:03:55.241 --> 00:03:58.330
but twice a first proper celebrity scandal,

69
00:03:58.360 --> 00:04:02.020
but the trouble with fairytales even gaudy ones is that they're not real.

70
00:04:02.440 --> 00:04:05.620
Jan Ching may have been living a rags to riches story.

71
00:04:05.910 --> 00:04:09.450
<v 2>But it was exactly that a story one that would.</v>

72
00:04:09.630 --> 00:04:13.350
<v 0>Improve as fake as the stagey love scenes that she acted in.</v>

73
00:04:13.590 --> 00:04:16.740
This was China in the 20th century. Remember nobody,

74
00:04:16.920 --> 00:04:20.040
least of all Jan Ching was going to have a happy ending

75
00:04:27.570 --> 00:04:31.380
Parity of the Nanjing decade. Abruptly ended on July the seventh, 1937.

76
00:04:31.530 --> 00:04:35.280
That was the day a skirmish between Japanese and Chinese troops at the Marco

77
00:04:35.281 --> 00:04:39.840
polo bridge snowballed into a full blown Japanese invasion as the second

78
00:04:39.841 --> 00:04:41.340
Sino-Japanese war erupted.

79
00:04:41.790 --> 00:04:46.590
Jen floods exposed Shanghai for the wartime capital of Chong Ching good

80
00:04:46.591 --> 00:04:49.650
job too. Only a month after the Marco polo bridge incidents,

81
00:04:49.651 --> 00:04:53.700
the Japanese marched on the port city unleashing an orgy of islands. Yeah,

82
00:04:53.760 --> 00:04:58.570
this wouldn't be the only city Jen Ching flood that year and nationalists John

83
00:04:58.980 --> 00:04:59.100
Jen,

84
00:04:59.100 --> 00:05:02.970
she became worried her socially conscious left-wing films would come back to

85
00:05:03.240 --> 00:05:06.090
haunt up. So she fled again, this time crossing into communist territory.

86
00:05:06.360 --> 00:05:11.220
And that was how she wound up meeting the man who transformed Chinese history by

87
00:05:11.221 --> 00:05:15.780
1937 miles dong was in his mid forties and security in control of the communist

88
00:05:16.230 --> 00:05:16.380
movements.

89
00:05:16.380 --> 00:05:21.270
He was also showing classic signs of dictator egomania when he spoke at your non

90
00:05:21.271 --> 00:05:22.530
arts Academy, he couldn't help,

91
00:05:22.531 --> 00:05:26.880
but be flattered by the audience member with the movie stolen looks the one who

92
00:05:26.881 --> 00:05:28.320
enthusiastically applauded his,

93
00:05:28.321 --> 00:05:33.270
every word that meeting after mouse speech was the start of GM King's real

94
00:05:33.271 --> 00:05:33.990
rise.

95
00:05:33.990 --> 00:05:38.610
Not that it would be easy or even particularly moral at the time Jang and mal

96
00:05:38.611 --> 00:05:41.280
became lovers. Now we're still married to his third wife.

97
00:05:41.310 --> 00:05:43.680
He's a gen loyal revolutionary.

98
00:05:43.681 --> 00:05:46.050
Who'd been one of the few women to survive the long March.

99
00:05:46.110 --> 00:05:50.100
So she was so popular within the communist movements that the party tried to

100
00:05:50.101 --> 00:05:54.900
stop mousy and Jang, but now was petulance declaring without a blue Apple.

101
00:05:55.020 --> 00:05:57.830
I cannot go on with the revolution and long last,

102
00:05:57.831 --> 00:05:59.600
and only when Jan was pregnant,

103
00:05:59.900 --> 00:06:02.450
it was an agreement reached now could marry the actress,

104
00:06:02.480 --> 00:06:05.570
but you have to promise that she would never try to enter politics.

105
00:06:05.690 --> 00:06:09.260
This was a big deal. The wives of most communist leaders had very public,

106
00:06:09.290 --> 00:06:13.190
very powerful roles within the party. Not quite equal to their husbands,

107
00:06:13.191 --> 00:06:14.840
but not exactly stuck at home,

108
00:06:14.900 --> 00:06:17.240
but it seems the communist higher ups could sense.

109
00:06:17.270 --> 00:06:22.220
Jangs burning ambition hung off of power. That was almost equal to mouse.

110
00:06:22.280 --> 00:06:26.540
So they made mal promise and unexpectedly now kept that promise.

111
00:06:26.600 --> 00:06:29.870
He divorced his yen and had a committed to a Russian mental hospital.

112
00:06:29.871 --> 00:06:34.520
Then married Jang and proceeded to push her back into the shadows in no time at

113
00:06:34.521 --> 00:06:36.380
all of the sex had gone from their relationship.

114
00:06:36.770 --> 00:06:40.010
Mal began shacking up with young revolutionaries behind Yang's back.

115
00:06:40.011 --> 00:06:44.660
Although he never divorced, she was too loyal to fawning, never answering back,

116
00:06:44.780 --> 00:06:49.340
worshiping him like a God. So Mao capita, even as the Japanese were defeated,

117
00:06:49.520 --> 00:06:54.080
even as he turned on and destroyed the Komen Tang and became head of the

118
00:06:54.081 --> 00:06:58.040
people's Republic of China in October, 1949, but little did Mauser.

119
00:06:58.280 --> 00:07:03.140
Don realize that his demure is a wife was using him as ruthlessly as he used

120
00:07:03.141 --> 00:07:06.350
others. Sex is engaging in the first rounds,

121
00:07:06.380 --> 00:07:08.450
Jen Ching later set of their relationship.

122
00:07:08.600 --> 00:07:13.550
But what sustains interest in the long run is power by her relationship

123
00:07:13.551 --> 00:07:17.900
with Mouser dong should soon amass enough power to transform the face of China.

124
00:07:18.000 --> 00:07:18.833
For real,

125
00:07:25.070 --> 00:07:28.900
With rulings and full narratives is that life is rarely that simple rather than

126
00:07:29.080 --> 00:07:30.100
shooting to the top.

127
00:07:30.190 --> 00:07:33.430
And most people just stumble upwards and then stumbled back down.

128
00:07:33.460 --> 00:07:35.470
Such was the case with Jan chin.

129
00:07:35.590 --> 00:07:40.030
At least for the rise part kept in the backgrounds by Mao and heavily medicated.

130
00:07:40.031 --> 00:07:43.450
It's likely Jang in the 1950s didn't feel she was rising at all.

131
00:07:43.540 --> 00:07:46.180
Instead it seems she mostly felt mentally unwell.

132
00:07:46.210 --> 00:07:49.960
She began to believe the colors pink and Brown triggered migraines that even the

133
00:07:49.961 --> 00:07:54.610
quietest house was filled with inescapable noise snobbery by leading communists,

134
00:07:54.611 --> 00:07:58.780
she belittled and shouted at everyone who came near her yet refuse to be left

135
00:07:58.781 --> 00:08:02.140
alone for even a minute. For those familiar with mouse pass marriage,

136
00:08:02.290 --> 00:08:06.250
it must've seemed like Jen Ching was doomed to be shipped off to, uh,

137
00:08:06.280 --> 00:08:08.770
own Russian asylum in the very near future.

138
00:08:08.890 --> 00:08:10.810
But before you go feeling too sorry for her,

139
00:08:11.020 --> 00:08:14.590
we should probably take a quick look at what was happening in the rest of China

140
00:08:14.770 --> 00:08:15.940
at the end of the 1950s.

141
00:08:15.940 --> 00:08:19.750
Mao's great leap forward triggered probably the worst famine in human history as

142
00:08:19.751 --> 00:08:23.980
villages were corralled into communes and forced to meet impossible grain

143
00:08:23.981 --> 00:08:26.650
quotas, their story, and a Frank Decata estimates,

144
00:08:26.651 --> 00:08:30.220
45 million staff to death for a grim comparison points.

145
00:08:30.250 --> 00:08:34.360
The total number of dead in the whole of world war one was around 20 million.

146
00:08:34.450 --> 00:08:35.640
So yeah,

147
00:08:35.650 --> 00:08:39.550
it probably kind of socks is a Madame Mao locked away in snubbed by your

148
00:08:40.090 --> 00:08:40.751
husband's comrades,

149
00:08:40.751 --> 00:08:45.070
but it probably sucked significantly more to be dying in some frozen field. Yes,

150
00:08:45.100 --> 00:08:49.450
it would be the same famine that rescued gin gin from a scarcity by

151
00:08:49.451 --> 00:08:50.231
1962.

152
00:08:50.231 --> 00:08:54.040
It was obvious to even now that is great leap forward had been more like the

153
00:08:54.250 --> 00:08:57.240
great leap into a catastrophe.

154
00:08:57.270 --> 00:08:59.280
The atmosphere in the party was mucinous.

155
00:08:59.520 --> 00:09:03.750
There were open criticisms of now suddenly weakens the Chapman needed as many

156
00:09:03.751 --> 00:09:08.250
ultra loyalists around us that you could find less TV to post and who was more

157
00:09:08.251 --> 00:09:12.180
loyal than his darling wife on September the 29th, 1962,

158
00:09:12.181 --> 00:09:16.620
over 20 years after they married Mao introduced Jen Ching to a party

159
00:09:16.621 --> 00:09:19.530
conference, bringing her into the limelight immediately.

160
00:09:19.740 --> 00:09:23.640
Jang began amassing a power base latching onto the defense minister in PR.

161
00:09:23.670 --> 00:09:28.290
She had made herself the Army's cultural commissar from the ashy engineered a

162
00:09:28.291 --> 00:09:30.150
drive to purify China's culture,

163
00:09:30.180 --> 00:09:33.540
purging playwrights and opera companies that failed to produce appropriately.

164
00:09:33.840 --> 00:09:36.630
Revolutionary works at the height of her purge,

165
00:09:36.660 --> 00:09:38.840
even managed to top all the minister of culture,

166
00:09:39.180 --> 00:09:42.600
big scalp for someone so new to the game. But then again,

167
00:09:42.660 --> 00:09:46.470
Jen Ching was a natural death spots ever since an actress days,

168
00:09:46.620 --> 00:09:48.000
she had excelled at holding a grudge,

169
00:09:48.210 --> 00:09:51.000
and now we're given a free reign to attack the cultural sex. Uh,

170
00:09:51.150 --> 00:09:54.510
she had said about harassing as many detractors as she could get away with.

171
00:09:54.630 --> 00:09:57.960
She'd even stuck. The knife into a husband is one of the revolutionary plays.

172
00:09:57.961 --> 00:10:01.620
She approved involved in elderly Tyron's with a beautiful young wife.

173
00:10:01.621 --> 00:10:04.950
He fails to satisfy and then kills now with heroin.

174
00:10:05.010 --> 00:10:08.100
He watched the Beijing performance looking like someone had just forced fed in

175
00:10:08.190 --> 00:10:12.090
the sink full of lemons, but rather than turn on his newly insolent wife,

176
00:10:12.150 --> 00:10:16.230
Jangs spirited purge seems to have given now a bit of an idea by

177
00:10:16.231 --> 00:10:17.190
1965,

178
00:10:17.191 --> 00:10:20.070
there were dangerous rumblings that the failure of the great leap forward could

179
00:10:20.220 --> 00:10:21.060
topple the chairman.

180
00:10:21.120 --> 00:10:25.830
So bowel survive the only way he knew how not by setting traps and reflexively

181
00:10:25.860 --> 00:10:29.280
purging like Starlin would, but by creating so much chaos,

182
00:10:29.310 --> 00:10:34.200
his rule would come to be seen as the one steady rock that the nation could

183
00:10:34.470 --> 00:10:37.740
cling to. He called his new project, the cultural revolution,

184
00:10:37.950 --> 00:10:41.610
and it would send China spiraling into new depths of maps.

185
00:10:48.170 --> 00:10:48.410
<v 1>[Inaudible].</v>

186
00:10:48.410 --> 00:10:49.580
<v 0>February, 1965.</v>

187
00:10:49.910 --> 00:10:53.840
Jan chin found herself rezoning to Shanghai on Mao's orders for the first time

188
00:10:53.841 --> 00:10:56.150
in years. Although you should needle him with a play.

189
00:10:56.450 --> 00:10:59.780
Jan was always fanatically loyal to her husband when he's older to go back to

190
00:10:59.781 --> 00:11:03.620
the city of our acting days, she didn't think twice. Once in Shanghai,

191
00:11:03.950 --> 00:11:08.030
Jan hooked up with the party's local director of propaganda [inaudible] and to

192
00:11:08.031 --> 00:11:10.730
the acerbic writer, Yahweh and Yon together,

193
00:11:10.940 --> 00:11:14.900
they would form three quarters of China's notorious gang of four,

194
00:11:14.990 --> 00:11:16.460
but that was in the future for now.

195
00:11:16.461 --> 00:11:19.940
The gang of not quite four were focused on setting up a secret rival to

196
00:11:19.941 --> 00:11:24.580
Beijing's ministry of culture just in time for mal to purge the real thing now

197
00:11:24.680 --> 00:11:27.500
had already chosen the cultural sphere as the next battle grounds.

198
00:11:27.650 --> 00:11:31.790
He just needed someone to first clear the decks of the party's old guard,

199
00:11:31.970 --> 00:11:35.510
Jan Ching happily obliged in February, 1966,

200
00:11:35.600 --> 00:11:39.470
our Shanghai unit launched a broadside against the last guardians of culture.

201
00:11:39.680 --> 00:11:43.550
Labeling them a black force, trying to dominate our politics right onto you.

202
00:11:43.551 --> 00:11:47.360
The targets were denounced and purged leaving the Shanghai units at the

203
00:11:47.840 --> 00:11:48.620
forefronts of propaganda.

204
00:11:48.620 --> 00:11:51.800
It was the start of a steady drum beat towards Xanarchy.

205
00:11:51.950 --> 00:11:55.120
The pace first picked up in when the people's daily, a party mouthpiece,

206
00:11:55.690 --> 00:11:59.320
exhorted students to turn against cultural traders against speed.

207
00:11:59.321 --> 00:12:02.680
When students in the cities responded by painting the first big character

208
00:12:02.681 --> 00:12:03.850
posters, sheets,

209
00:12:03.910 --> 00:12:08.440
as big as a door sprayed with revolutionary calls to arms and denunciations.

210
00:12:08.470 --> 00:12:09.160
Finally,

211
00:12:09.160 --> 00:12:13.870
it reached a Gallop when mal made his move on may the 16th malware organized a

212
00:12:13.900 --> 00:12:18.400
secret memo, targeting bourgeoisie who had sneaked into the communist party,

213
00:12:18.520 --> 00:12:22.720
the government, the army, and various spheres of culture. Shortly thereafter,

214
00:12:22.780 --> 00:12:26.980
the cultural revolution group was born consisting of Jen Ching and a gang of

215
00:12:26.981 --> 00:12:29.560
four minus one. Plus some ultra loyalists.

216
00:12:29.561 --> 00:12:33.700
The group was allowed to operate outside of checks and balances from their

217
00:12:33.701 --> 00:12:36.640
offices near the forbidden city. They controlled propaganda.

218
00:12:36.670 --> 00:12:38.980
The means of communication, the machinery of state.

219
00:12:39.220 --> 00:12:42.400
It was essentially a coup one, which kept now in charge,

220
00:12:42.430 --> 00:12:44.380
but rips power away from anyone unto him,

221
00:12:44.530 --> 00:12:48.850
who wasn't named Jang Ching and Madame Mao was determined to use a new found

222
00:12:48.851 --> 00:12:52.900
power to make our husband proud. You have an [inaudible] came on June.

223
00:12:52.901 --> 00:12:53.950
The first that day,

224
00:12:53.951 --> 00:12:56.980
the cultural revolution group issued an article in the people's daily.

225
00:12:56.981 --> 00:13:00.940
Calling on students do sweep away all monsters and demons.

226
00:13:01.150 --> 00:13:04.150
It's singled out teachers and school masters claiming they corrupted the youth

227
00:13:04.151 --> 00:13:06.850
with reactionary thoughts that same evening,

228
00:13:06.880 --> 00:13:10.750
big character posters put up by Beijing students denouncing that teachers will

229
00:13:10.960 --> 00:13:14.410
read out live on radio. The next day, all schools were suspended.

230
00:13:14.890 --> 00:13:17.920
There's the opening of the floodgates rather than stay home.

231
00:13:17.921 --> 00:13:21.580
The nation's teenagers swarmed to their schools where party cadres handed out

232
00:13:21.610 --> 00:13:22.570
paper and paint.

233
00:13:22.810 --> 00:13:27.130
Big character posters began appearing in every classroom by breeding teachers

234
00:13:27.131 --> 00:13:28.630
and fellow students.

235
00:13:28.690 --> 00:13:33.460
But what to do with those who had been to now inst the answer came on June the

236
00:13:33.461 --> 00:13:37.960
13th. That day I to televise mass draw in Beijing images were broadcast of

237
00:13:39.130 --> 00:13:41.530
counter-revolutionaries forced to confess their sins and submit before a

238
00:13:41.531 --> 00:13:45.490
screaming crowd of thousands. Even girls, as young as six were filmed,

239
00:13:45.550 --> 00:13:46.960
shrieking kill,

240
00:13:47.290 --> 00:13:51.880
kill the template for the cultural revolution had at last been

241
00:13:51.881 --> 00:13:55.300
set. Now is the time for the carnage to begin.

242
00:14:02.100 --> 00:14:02.280
<v 3>[Inaudible].</v>

243
00:14:02.280 --> 00:14:06.930
<v 0>1966, China slips into a hellish fever dream across the June and July.</v>

244
00:14:06.931 --> 00:14:09.780
The nation students went full Lord of the flies.

245
00:14:09.900 --> 00:14:11.850
Denounced teachers were forced to wear Dunn,

246
00:14:12.270 --> 00:14:15.900
scaps or made to crawl through school with signs saying dog hanging around.

247
00:14:15.901 --> 00:14:19.020
Then next by the middle of the month, the students have graduated to torture,

248
00:14:19.050 --> 00:14:23.130
forcing principals to kneel on broken glass for hours at a time on June the 16th

249
00:14:23.190 --> 00:14:26.250
chairman Mao's swam across the Yangtze river to show he was ready for

250
00:14:26.251 --> 00:14:27.420
ideological battle.

251
00:14:27.660 --> 00:14:31.260
He dismantled the work team's future premier den shopping that sent him to

252
00:14:31.261 --> 00:14:34.350
schools to try and calm the situation by late July.

253
00:14:34.380 --> 00:14:38.340
The first deaths from suicide from overzealous torture had been reported,

254
00:14:38.580 --> 00:14:42.900
but mal responded simply by painting his own big character poster declaring

255
00:14:43.860 --> 00:14:47.400
bombards the headquarters shortly after a big character posters swept out of

256
00:14:47.401 --> 00:14:50.550
schools and across Beijing covering every available surface.

257
00:14:50.640 --> 00:14:54.170
It became vital to study them every day to see if you'd been denounced.

258
00:14:54.230 --> 00:14:57.170
But the real terror started on August the eighth, that day,

259
00:14:57.200 --> 00:15:00.320
just three days after a gang of teenage girls and publicly beaten their

260
00:15:00.321 --> 00:15:01.640
vice-principal to death.

261
00:15:01.700 --> 00:15:04.850
The cultural revolution group announced 16 new articles.

262
00:15:04.940 --> 00:15:09.350
The articles encouraged students to destroy the full olds, old customs,

263
00:15:09.410 --> 00:15:13.520
old culture, old habits and old ideas. And most importantly,

264
00:15:13.700 --> 00:15:17.510
they declared that no action would be taken against students who engaged in

265
00:15:17.511 --> 00:15:18.170
violence.

266
00:15:18.170 --> 00:15:22.760
No matter what they did just like that open season had been

267
00:15:22.761 --> 00:15:24.980
declared red August is infamous today.

268
00:15:25.080 --> 00:15:29.170
How quickly it devolved into anarchy teenagers. Most of them barely 14 or 15.

269
00:15:29.180 --> 00:15:33.620
Self-organized into red guard units that imprisoned teachers and fellow students

270
00:15:33.621 --> 00:15:37.580
and killed them in grotesque ways. People had boiling water poured over them.

271
00:15:37.760 --> 00:15:40.340
Others were stoned to death in elementary schools,

272
00:15:40.341 --> 00:15:44.390
children of only 10 or 12 forced their teachers to swallow nails. Soon,

273
00:15:44.391 --> 00:15:46.580
the violence was spilling out into the streets.

274
00:15:46.730 --> 00:15:50.240
As teenage red guards began attacking the homes of anyone who looked

275
00:15:51.260 --> 00:15:53.870
counterrevolutionary not long after lists of targets for bad by the cultural

276
00:15:53.871 --> 00:15:55.820
revolution group started appearing on walls,

277
00:15:55.821 --> 00:15:57.920
adding to the violence by late September,

278
00:15:57.921 --> 00:16:02.570
nearly 2000 people had been murdered in Beijing alone butts for gen Ching life

279
00:16:02.571 --> 00:16:06.140
was a non-stop party as now used the chaos to shore up his own position.

280
00:16:06.350 --> 00:16:09.800
Jang used it to settle scores in January of 1967.

281
00:16:09.801 --> 00:16:13.790
Her group over through the local communist party in Shanghai triggering a wave

282
00:16:13.791 --> 00:16:14.690
of uprisings.

283
00:16:14.870 --> 00:16:19.280
His red guards seized weapons from the army and turn cities into war zones at

284
00:16:19.281 --> 00:16:21.860
blast United with the last member of her gang of four,

285
00:16:21.890 --> 00:16:26.450
the labor activist Wang Hong, when Jang became the face of the chaos,

286
00:16:26.480 --> 00:16:30.080
gripping China, she had head on posters, made speeches to tens of thousands.

287
00:16:30.080 --> 00:16:32.990
Had books dedicated to her in charge of culture and outfit.

288
00:16:32.991 --> 00:16:37.010
She banned all the eight operas and wrote exacting rules on how everything from

289
00:16:37.011 --> 00:16:39.260
music to theater to novels should be created.

290
00:16:39.440 --> 00:16:42.200
She then said about using these rules to target all of those.

291
00:16:42.350 --> 00:16:45.560
She felt had personally wronged our actor, ciao. Dan,

292
00:16:45.561 --> 00:16:49.430
who refused to appear opposite her onstage in the 1930s was hounded and

293
00:16:49.431 --> 00:16:50.120
tortured.

294
00:16:50.120 --> 00:16:54.650
A script writer named Shand yang was denounced because he hadn't wanted to write

295
00:16:55.070 --> 00:16:57.830
Jang apart decades before a CoStar named Lee Lily,

296
00:16:57.840 --> 00:17:01.580
who'd gotten better reviews for a 1936 film. She in Jang appeared in,

297
00:17:01.581 --> 00:17:02.660
was arrested.

298
00:17:02.870 --> 00:17:07.340
The whole family tortured husband died from the ordeal nor did Jang stop at

299
00:17:07.341 --> 00:17:07.940
artists.

300
00:17:07.940 --> 00:17:11.480
The children of senior communists suet snubbed her after a marriage to malware

301
00:17:11.900 --> 00:17:15.110
murders. The future premiere dang shopping was denounced twice.

302
00:17:15.111 --> 00:17:19.280
And his son crippled by torture even today's Chinese president Xi Jing things,

303
00:17:19.281 --> 00:17:21.920
or his father arrested and humiliated during the upheaval,

304
00:17:22.190 --> 00:17:25.400
the Westport Jang Chen and the cultural revolution group.

305
00:17:25.910 --> 00:17:26.870
We're just getting started

306
00:17:33.130 --> 00:17:37.960
In 1967 Malraux to Jang Chang telling her the goal of the revolution

307
00:17:37.961 --> 00:17:42.370
was a great disorder under heaven that would later inspire greater order under

308
00:17:42.371 --> 00:17:44.620
heaven. The Germans certainly got the firmest part, right?

309
00:17:44.830 --> 00:17:48.100
A full accounts of all the crimes committed would probably require a starting a

310
00:17:48.101 --> 00:17:52.020
whole new channel called revolution to graphics and uploading daily videos.

311
00:17:52.021 --> 00:17:54.060
For the next five years boss,

312
00:17:54.061 --> 00:17:58.560
we can give you an overview so you can understand how it must've felt to be

313
00:17:58.561 --> 00:17:59.850
alive. At that time.

314
00:17:59.910 --> 00:18:04.650
The biggest flavor of the period was a mix of insanity and extreme cruelty

315
00:18:05.010 --> 00:18:09.000
in Beijing red guard units, declared cats with symbols of bourgeoisie,

316
00:18:09.030 --> 00:18:09.691
decadence,

317
00:18:09.691 --> 00:18:13.710
and set about conducting a great cast massacre in which thousands of strays are

318
00:18:13.711 --> 00:18:16.170
tortured and killed out in the villages of Volkswagen,

319
00:18:16.260 --> 00:18:18.750
human bad elements were vivisected alive.

320
00:18:18.960 --> 00:18:23.790
Their internal organs eaten by local party bosses in Dow's Yan villages use the

321
00:18:23.791 --> 00:18:25.200
chaos to settle old scores,

322
00:18:25.201 --> 00:18:28.860
butchering the babies of enemies for having a bad class backgrounds.

323
00:18:28.980 --> 00:18:32.250
Often this chaos was utterly self-defeating in Wu Han.

324
00:18:32.310 --> 00:18:36.330
So many doctors were denounced that the healthcare system collapsed in Shang Xi.

325
00:18:36.340 --> 00:18:37.830
The transport networks fell apart.

326
00:18:37.831 --> 00:18:42.510
So spectacularly that feminine set in millions were reduced to two eating mud

327
00:18:42.720 --> 00:18:43.950
and bark to survive.

328
00:18:44.220 --> 00:18:48.390
Then there were the suicides being denounced in the cultural revolution didn't

329
00:18:48.391 --> 00:18:51.000
always mean being killed, but it did mean losing your job,

330
00:18:51.060 --> 00:18:52.500
being paraded through the streets,

331
00:18:52.530 --> 00:18:57.150
spat on by your neighbors and humiliated in front of thousands and struggle

332
00:18:57.151 --> 00:18:57.870
sessions.

333
00:18:57.870 --> 00:19:01.860
Not surprisingly many killed themselves in the wake of this and who Bay 600

334
00:19:01.861 --> 00:19:04.830
people committed suicide in just six weeks. Overall.

335
00:19:04.831 --> 00:19:08.640
It's thought that anywhere between 500,000 and 2 million died in the cultural

336
00:19:08.641 --> 00:19:12.000
revolution with millions more tortured by self appointed,

337
00:19:12.030 --> 00:19:15.960
teenage revolutionaries by attend the education system have disintegrated.

338
00:19:16.140 --> 00:19:20.220
20% of the population was suffering from malnutrition productivity had

339
00:19:20.221 --> 00:19:22.800
collapsed. The economy was a ruin,

340
00:19:23.250 --> 00:19:28.050
but it achieved its goal now's it was still in power and stronger than ever.

341
00:19:28.230 --> 00:19:32.880
Sadly for Jen Ching though, her survival wasn't so clear. Cut in 1968,

342
00:19:33.090 --> 00:19:35.550
mal began to worry that his wife was getting too powerful.

343
00:19:35.730 --> 00:19:40.080
He started telling people she had great aspirations, but not an ounce of talent.

344
00:19:40.260 --> 00:19:43.890
Shortly after the military moved into the cities to restore order or ed guns

345
00:19:44.070 --> 00:19:48.180
were disarmed and sent by the millions to the countryside to learn from the

346
00:19:48.181 --> 00:19:49.410
peasants. In reality,

347
00:19:49.411 --> 00:19:52.530
this meant 12 million teenagers essentially becoming slaves forced to do

348
00:19:52.531 --> 00:19:55.530
backbreaking labor, thousands of kilometers from home. Yeah,

349
00:19:55.620 --> 00:19:59.400
it's a Lockwood ensure that Jen Ching wasn't thrown to the wolves alongside them

350
00:19:59.550 --> 00:20:02.820
as the anarchic phase of the cultural revolution wound down there.

351
00:20:02.821 --> 00:20:07.260
Now aging mal anointed, the general Lin Biao as his heir apparent,

352
00:20:07.350 --> 00:20:09.150
but when then was killed in a plane crash,

353
00:20:09.151 --> 00:20:13.200
it was Jen chin and a gang of four that filled the vacuum still completely in

354
00:20:13.201 --> 00:20:14.910
control of culture and propaganda.

355
00:20:15.090 --> 00:20:18.690
Jang was now on a crazy high with no one left to replace.

356
00:20:18.960 --> 00:20:22.820
Now it really looks like she might become China's next leader by 1974,

357
00:20:22.830 --> 00:20:25.740
she was even comparing herself to the legendary Uzi tan.

358
00:20:25.741 --> 00:20:30.090
The only Empress did directly rule Imperial China, sadly for blue Apple though.

359
00:20:30.150 --> 00:20:34.530
Fate had other plans rather than being the thing that ensured our survival.

360
00:20:34.531 --> 00:20:37.830
The cultural revolution would ensure gen chings downfall.

361
00:20:44.240 --> 00:20:44.930
<v 1>In the end.</v>

362
00:20:44.930 --> 00:20:48.400
<v 0>Jang Chang was outplayed by one dang shopping,</v>

363
00:20:48.670 --> 00:20:50.380
purged and rehabilitated under Mao,

364
00:20:50.381 --> 00:20:53.280
and then purge twice by the car revolution group. Dang,

365
00:20:53.310 --> 00:20:56.780
finally reappeared in public life in 1975 by now,

366
00:20:57.180 --> 00:21:00.480
Jan was basically waiting for two powerful old men to die.

367
00:21:00.660 --> 00:21:04.080
Her husbands and the popular premiere ciao and lie.

368
00:21:04.260 --> 00:21:07.980
When Joe obligingly kicked to the buckets on January the eighth, 1976,

369
00:21:08.400 --> 00:21:12.420
Jenn swiftly purged his allies ridding herself of the last challenges to a

370
00:21:12.421 --> 00:21:12.960
power.

371
00:21:12.960 --> 00:21:17.190
She forbid public mourning of jail wins when den shopping made a stirring speech

372
00:21:17.280 --> 00:21:21.210
in the premiere has memory. She had been purged for the 9000000th time,

373
00:21:21.390 --> 00:21:25.950
but crafty dang had realized something that Madame Mao was too arrogant to

374
00:21:25.951 --> 00:21:29.220
see the gang of four were hated by the military and the party,

375
00:21:29.550 --> 00:21:31.800
their power lay and their ability to whip up the mall.

376
00:21:31.801 --> 00:21:36.630
But to get the people on their side, the same people who had loved premier Zhao,

377
00:21:36.690 --> 00:21:37.740
the same premier Zhao,

378
00:21:37.770 --> 00:21:42.510
whose memory Jang had just pistol over by arresting dang for

379
00:21:42.511 --> 00:21:45.060
honoring him on March 31st, 1976,

380
00:21:45.720 --> 00:21:49.560
protesters appeared in gentleman's square crying, Jang, the witch,

381
00:21:49.680 --> 00:21:53.340
as she watched through binoculars blue Apple had them attacked and beaten with

382
00:21:53.341 --> 00:21:57.030
on boss lay scaffold into them, right? But the damage had been done.

383
00:21:57.150 --> 00:21:59.850
Jang had now attacked both the people's premiere, right?

384
00:21:59.940 --> 00:22:02.580
The people themselves never again with the gang of four,

385
00:22:02.581 --> 00:22:05.550
be able to unleash anarchy on the streets. And one fell swoop.

386
00:22:05.670 --> 00:22:08.940
Jang had destroyed one of the two things, keeping her alive.

387
00:22:09.210 --> 00:22:12.330
The other vanish shortly thereafter on September the ninth,

388
00:22:12.331 --> 00:22:14.880
1976 miles long died at the age of 18,

389
00:22:15.300 --> 00:22:18.120
less than a month later was a BRM using was called they're.

390
00:22:18.121 --> 00:22:22.050
The three isn't members of the gang of four were arrested paranoid to the end.

391
00:22:22.920 --> 00:22:24.420
John Chang had wisely stayed away,

392
00:22:24.421 --> 00:22:28.350
but she was quickly tracked down and arrested by military who are now looking

393
00:22:28.351 --> 00:22:33.240
for revenge as if to underscore how low opinion of the gang of four fallen news

394
00:22:33.241 --> 00:22:37.830
of their downfall caused such big celebrations that Beijing ran out of

395
00:22:37.831 --> 00:22:42.060
alcohol four years later with Dennis sharping. Now not just rehabilitated,

396
00:22:42.061 --> 00:22:43.470
but in charge of the country,

397
00:22:43.800 --> 00:22:47.820
that trial began things problem was that someone needed to do draw the line

398
00:22:47.850 --> 00:22:52.380
under the accesses of the Mao era is Khrushchev had done with stolen in his

399
00:22:52.381 --> 00:22:53.214
secret speech,

400
00:22:53.340 --> 00:22:56.820
but now was both the parties stolen and it's Lennon and it's source of

401
00:22:56.970 --> 00:22:59.850
legitimacy for ruling China mountains.

402
00:22:59.850 --> 00:23:02.280
The whole edifice would come crashing down. Dang.

403
00:23:02.340 --> 00:23:05.970
His response was masterful while admitting Mao had made mistakes.

404
00:23:05.971 --> 00:23:10.440
The formula had landed on was that 70% of the stuff the chairman did was good

405
00:23:10.620 --> 00:23:12.990
and 30% was bad doing this.

406
00:23:13.350 --> 00:23:17.940
Dang shifted nearly all the blame for the many atrocities onto blue Apple at a

407
00:23:17.941 --> 00:23:18.630
show trial,

408
00:23:18.630 --> 00:23:22.950
Jang was blamed for the entire cultural revolution while she fought back telling

409
00:23:22.951 --> 00:23:25.080
the assembled communists, if I am guilty,

410
00:23:25.170 --> 00:23:29.820
how about you will it wasn't called a show trial for nothing in early 1981,

411
00:23:30.180 --> 00:23:33.360
Jan Ching was sentenced to death, commuted to life in prison.

412
00:23:33.570 --> 00:23:37.170
She was dragged from the court screaming, traitors fascists,

413
00:23:37.350 --> 00:23:40.890
but at the time was over a decade later in may of 1991,

414
00:23:41.460 --> 00:23:43.620
Jang was reported to have hung herself in a cell.

415
00:23:43.710 --> 00:23:47.210
Supposedly she left a note declaring chairman. I love you.

416
00:23:47.510 --> 00:23:50.930
Your students and comrade is coming to see you today.

417
00:23:51.300 --> 00:23:55.370
Jen chings name remains mud in China while dang shopping is hailed as the man

418
00:23:55.371 --> 00:23:59.270
who saved the economy and her husband is still lionized as a great leader,

419
00:23:59.450 --> 00:24:01.010
just like the whole 30% thing.

420
00:24:01.160 --> 00:24:05.390
Jang is associated only with the nightmare of the cultural revolution.

421
00:24:05.570 --> 00:24:07.310
Certainly she deserves this.

422
00:24:07.340 --> 00:24:11.840
Jang was a monster vindictive sociopath who helped engineer the

423
00:24:11.841 --> 00:24:14.390
chaos that killed maybe 2 million people.

424
00:24:14.690 --> 00:24:18.650
And yet it's worth remembering that she wasn't acting alone without Mao's

425
00:24:18.651 --> 00:24:20.060
desperate need to cling to power.

426
00:24:20.061 --> 00:24:24.110
The cultural revolution could have never happened no matter how vicious Jang

427
00:24:24.111 --> 00:24:27.920
was. Madame Mau was the architect of a catastrophe. Yes,

428
00:24:27.950 --> 00:24:30.080
but it was all in service of her.

429
00:24:30.740 --> 00:24:35.030
Husband's a man modern China still efficiently deifies even while they're

430
00:24:35.031 --> 00:24:38.420
missing. He made mistakes in the end.

431
00:24:38.870 --> 00:24:41.000
Jang may not have got a fairytale ending.

432
00:24:41.180 --> 00:24:44.840
That's a thuggish husbands got something like it. At least.

433
00:24:44.960 --> 00:24:49.010
Whereas reputation was concerned sadly in her death that was in her life.

434
00:24:49.160 --> 00:24:53.510
It seems that the troubled young actress was only ever destined to play a

435
00:24:53.511 --> 00:24:56.990
supporting role. So I really hope you found that video. Interesting. If you did,
