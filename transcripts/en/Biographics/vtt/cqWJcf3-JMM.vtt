1
00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:03.960
<v 0>He's one of the most successful smugglers in us history in the late 1970s and</v>

2
00:00:03.961 --> 00:00:08.310
early 1980s, Louisiana native Barry seal made a fortune trafficking,

3
00:00:08.370 --> 00:00:11.700
unbelievable quantities of cocaine onto American soil.

4
00:00:11.790 --> 00:00:16.470
A born pilots seal was able to, for years to our wit the DEA, the FBI,

5
00:00:16.620 --> 00:00:17.640
us customs,

6
00:00:17.641 --> 00:00:21.300
and any other federal agency that tried to stop him loosely connected to Pablo

7
00:00:21.301 --> 00:00:25.410
Escobar's notorious median cartel seal lived a life of adventure,

8
00:00:25.530 --> 00:00:30.060
riches and excitement in far off lands until suddenly

9
00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:34.710
he didn't in 1983 seal was called boasting in a wiretap and undated for

10
00:00:34.711 --> 00:00:38.910
smuggling facing a minimum of 10 years. He realized his only escape was to flip,

11
00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:43.530
to go from being America's top drug runner to its top da informants.

12
00:00:43.740 --> 00:00:47.190
There was a decision that would lead him from the battlefields of Nicaragua to

13
00:00:47.400 --> 00:00:49.050
the rain forest. South side,

14
00:00:49.051 --> 00:00:52.290
met a yean and to bring him face-to-face with Pablo Escobar,

15
00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:56.160
a twisted Funhouse mirror ride through the darker side of the 1980s.

16
00:00:56.161 --> 00:01:00.330
This is the story of Barry seal Louisiana's cocaine.

17
00:01:00.470 --> 00:01:01.303
<v 1>Cowboy.</v>

18
00:01:13.220 --> 00:01:18.020
<v 0>It was a sultry day in Baton Rouge when Adler Berryman seal known all his life</v>

19
00:01:18.021 --> 00:01:21.830
as Barry seal was born on the 16th of July, 1939.

20
00:01:21.860 --> 00:01:26.390
And that is one of the last uncontested facts you're going to hear during this

21
00:01:26.391 --> 00:01:27.410
entire story,

22
00:01:27.470 --> 00:01:31.550
thanks to his pension for aliases possible connections with the CIA and love of

23
00:01:31.580 --> 00:01:33.020
spinning tall tales.

24
00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:37.280
It's surprisingly hard to get a definitive account of Barry seal's life.

25
00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:41.630
We found sources that contend he was nothing but a glorified con man, others,

26
00:01:41.631 --> 00:01:44.420
that insist he was a long-term CIA asset.

27
00:01:44.510 --> 00:01:48.530
And yet others that implicate him in everything from the Bay of pigs to the JFK

28
00:01:48.531 --> 00:01:50.210
assassination. In other words,

29
00:01:50.360 --> 00:01:53.810
we've had to do a lot of picking and choosing with this one,

30
00:01:53.811 --> 00:01:58.460
trying to tease a narrative out of a true mess of sources while we've

31
00:01:58.520 --> 00:02:00.860
hopefully got something approaching the truth.

32
00:02:01.100 --> 00:02:03.530
Please do keep one crucial fact in minds.

33
00:02:03.830 --> 00:02:08.600
No one on earth could talk as much crap as Barry seal and as Barry

34
00:02:08.601 --> 00:02:12.560
seal sure liked to hear himself talk from his earliest days,

35
00:02:12.561 --> 00:02:16.100
the young boy was obsessed with the planes that buzz through the skies above

36
00:02:16.101 --> 00:02:19.970
Baton Rouge by his teenage years seal was spending all of his free time hanging

37
00:02:19.971 --> 00:02:23.210
around the app or talking to any pilot who'd PAMs and minds.

38
00:02:23.240 --> 00:02:24.890
It helps that even at this young age,

39
00:02:24.891 --> 00:02:29.450
he was naturally charismatic with a storyteller's instinct and an affable charm,

40
00:02:29.570 --> 00:02:32.600
but charisma wasn't Barry seal's only talent age,

41
00:02:32.630 --> 00:02:35.060
just 15 seals started pilot lessons.

42
00:02:35.300 --> 00:02:39.230
It turns out to be such a natural that his instructor was letting him fly solo

43
00:02:39.470 --> 00:02:42.260
after only eight hours of training. Because of course,

44
00:02:42.261 --> 00:02:45.680
it's not like letting an untrained teenager take command of flying bond,

45
00:02:45.860 --> 00:02:50.150
could somehow go wrong and go wrong. It really could've. Despite his talent,

46
00:02:50.690 --> 00:02:54.350
Ceil was a crazy risk taker pushing his aircraft to its very limits.

47
00:02:54.740 --> 00:02:58.670
His instructor even noted. He seemed incapable of grasping how his actions had,

48
00:02:59.620 --> 00:03:01.540
but apparently borderline sociopathy.

49
00:03:01.570 --> 00:03:06.160
Isn't a disqualification for flying in Louisiana because seal was a qualified

50
00:03:06.161 --> 00:03:10.090
pilot. By the time he was 16, when he graduated high school in 1957,

51
00:03:10.091 --> 00:03:13.390
his yearbook noted. He was full of fun, full of folly.

52
00:03:13.570 --> 00:03:17.320
How writes his classmates would turn out to be after dropping out of college

53
00:03:17.620 --> 00:03:18.341
seal, set up a business,

54
00:03:18.341 --> 00:03:22.420
flying advertising banners over Baton Rouge on August the 10th, 1958.

55
00:03:22.450 --> 00:03:24.550
While trying to show off seal misjudged,

56
00:03:24.551 --> 00:03:27.400
a maneuver and sentence plane sign into the ground.

57
00:03:27.580 --> 00:03:31.210
The young pilot lost several teeth and spent a week in the hospital for any

58
00:03:31.211 --> 00:03:31.990
other teenager.

59
00:03:31.990 --> 00:03:35.170
This could have been the wake-up call the moments when they realized they

60
00:03:35.171 --> 00:03:39.910
weren't invisible and the bad things could really happen, but not Barry seal.

61
00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:44.650
In 1961 seal joined the Louisiana national guard signing up for additional pilot

62
00:03:44.651 --> 00:03:48.550
training there. He got so good at pushing an aircraft past its limits.

63
00:03:48.551 --> 00:03:53.050
So good at executing death defying stunts that he could fly in almost any

64
00:03:53.051 --> 00:03:57.280
conditions. It was a skill that it put to good use in the Vietnam,

65
00:03:57.610 --> 00:03:59.770
or would he, depending on who you ask a seal,

66
00:03:59.771 --> 00:04:03.190
either spent the mid sixties flying special forces missions in Vietnam,

67
00:04:03.370 --> 00:04:07.420
or he spent the time as an army reserve in the us quietly improving his pilot

68
00:04:07.430 --> 00:04:11.530
skills and lying about his military service. Both tails seem plausible.

69
00:04:12.070 --> 00:04:15.040
Seal would turn out to be such an expert at flying through the jungle that it's

70
00:04:15.041 --> 00:04:19.090
tempting to think that he must've had prior experience. On the other hand,

71
00:04:19.091 --> 00:04:23.890
his military record shows no signs of duty in Asia, let alone in a combat zone,

72
00:04:24.040 --> 00:04:28.570
whatever the truth it's generally agreed that by 1967 seal had been honorably

73
00:04:28.571 --> 00:04:33.370
discharged and got himself a job flying with the commercial airline TWA. There,

74
00:04:33.400 --> 00:04:36.400
he became one of the youngest command pilots that the fleet had ever seen,

75
00:04:36.730 --> 00:04:40.240
but his initial excitement soon wore off flying commercial.

76
00:04:40.270 --> 00:04:44.350
You were forbidden from doing the stunts that seal loved so much for an

77
00:04:44.351 --> 00:04:48.220
adrenaline junkie. Being a professional pilot was like URI,

78
00:04:48.250 --> 00:04:52.720
professionally watching paint dry, no seal needed excitement in his life.

79
00:04:52.721 --> 00:04:55.360
Some outlet to stave off the boredom.

80
00:04:55.660 --> 00:04:58.270
Luckily adventure was just around the corner.

81
00:05:04.650 --> 00:05:05.130
<v 2>Why don't you?</v>

82
00:05:05.130 --> 00:05:09.630
<v 0>72 Barry seal was a twice divorced pilot with a string of failing businesses and</v>

83
00:05:09.810 --> 00:05:13.170
Baton Rouge and deep desire to do something interesting.

84
00:05:13.380 --> 00:05:15.930
It was at this point so that he met Marie Morris Kessler.

85
00:05:16.740 --> 00:05:20.220
Kessler had some connections in Mexico with a bunch of anti-Castro Cubans.

86
00:05:20.340 --> 00:05:24.870
These guys needed a capable pilots to fly 1,350 pounds of plastic

87
00:05:24.871 --> 00:05:27.270
explosives down from the United States.

88
00:05:27.690 --> 00:05:30.270
And while they were willing to pay big here,

89
00:05:30.271 --> 00:05:33.990
it was the excitement seal had been craving the danger.

90
00:05:34.200 --> 00:05:35.730
What else was this overweight?

91
00:05:36.600 --> 00:05:39.210
Under-stimulated schlub from Louisiana going to do with such an offer?

92
00:05:39.710 --> 00:05:42.030
Of course he said, yes. And that's how on July?

93
00:05:42.031 --> 00:05:46.440
The first 1972 Barry seal came to be sat in a hotel room with seven other

94
00:05:46.441 --> 00:05:47.274
accomplices.

95
00:05:47.310 --> 00:05:51.210
When us customs agents broke down the door and arrested the lot of them,

96
00:05:51.870 --> 00:05:55.350
customers, Cubans, that just been a front for a federal sting operation.

97
00:05:55.590 --> 00:05:59.960
And now the government was going throw the book at Barry seal.

98
00:06:00.230 --> 00:06:01.430
And the summer of 1974,

99
00:06:01.431 --> 00:06:05.330
the case went to trial by now seal had been fired from his job at TWA.

100
00:06:05.331 --> 00:06:08.030
Who'd heard all about his aborted Mexican adventure.

101
00:06:08.390 --> 00:06:11.460
He'd lost most of his savings on legal fees. And on top of that,

102
00:06:11.540 --> 00:06:13.430
as it now looks like it was going to go to prison.

103
00:06:13.670 --> 00:06:18.620
The only reason he didn't was thanks to a miracle years later seal would boast

104
00:06:18.621 --> 00:06:23.090
a CIA buddies, stepped in and quashed the trial on grounds of national security.

105
00:06:23.480 --> 00:06:27.710
But the reality is that seal almost certainly had no connections with the agency

106
00:06:27.711 --> 00:06:30.590
at this point. And it's not like the trial never happens.

107
00:06:30.620 --> 00:06:33.950
The case played out in public court for five days. No.

108
00:06:34.040 --> 00:06:37.250
What really saved seal wasn't friends in high places,

109
00:06:37.580 --> 00:06:40.910
but good old fashioned governments in competence during the trial,

110
00:06:40.911 --> 00:06:44.930
the prosecution brandished an assault rifle before the jury claiming that it

111
00:06:44.931 --> 00:06:48.680
belonged to seal the defense pointed out that this was prejudicing. The jury,

112
00:06:48.681 --> 00:06:52.040
the judge declared a mistrial and seal walked free.

113
00:06:52.340 --> 00:06:56.180
There was the single luckiest break Barry seal would get in his entire life.

114
00:06:56.660 --> 00:06:59.390
Had the government's prosecution team not been so dumb.

115
00:06:59.420 --> 00:07:02.480
There'd be no story for this video at all.

116
00:07:02.720 --> 00:07:06.830
That same year seal married Deborah and Woah with whom he eventually had three

117
00:07:06.831 --> 00:07:10.400
children. But while it was great to be not just a married man,

118
00:07:10.610 --> 00:07:14.120
but a free married man seal was still in a bad place.

119
00:07:14.150 --> 00:07:15.860
DWA wouldn't take him back.

120
00:07:16.010 --> 00:07:19.730
Thanks to the smuggling trial had been blacklisted with the other airlines too.

121
00:07:19.850 --> 00:07:22.700
He was a broke unemployable, fantastically,

122
00:07:22.701 --> 00:07:25.160
talented pilot with nothing to do,

123
00:07:25.430 --> 00:07:28.550
but that was going to soon change as 1975.

124
00:07:28.551 --> 00:07:33.050
Dawn's demand for talented unscrupulous American pilots South of the border was

125
00:07:33.051 --> 00:07:34.070
about to explode.

126
00:07:34.190 --> 00:07:38.810
It was the beginning of the era of cocaine and it would transform Barry seal's

127
00:07:38.811 --> 00:07:39.644
life.

128
00:07:45.940 --> 00:07:46.751
In 1971,

129
00:07:46.751 --> 00:07:51.130
Richard Nixon stood before Congress to declare drug use was America's public

130
00:07:51.131 --> 00:07:54.250
enemy. Number one, it was the beginning of the war on drugs.

131
00:07:54.310 --> 00:07:57.910
Just two years later in 1973, the DEA was created,

132
00:07:58.000 --> 00:08:01.330
but if Nixon thought the drug scene was bad in 1971,

133
00:08:01.331 --> 00:08:03.970
with all those hippies smoking pot,

134
00:08:04.270 --> 00:08:09.070
things were about to get a whole lot worse. Cocaine had been around for a while,

135
00:08:09.071 --> 00:08:13.870
but it had always been too expensive too out of step with the 1960s,

136
00:08:14.310 --> 00:08:17.140
but mass production methods improved. The price began to drop.

137
00:08:17.230 --> 00:08:21.160
Even as the purity went up by the time Barry seal was in court,

138
00:08:21.190 --> 00:08:24.910
cocaine was no longer something only Hollywood royalty you could afford.

139
00:08:25.150 --> 00:08:29.560
And as the USA turned away from pot and LSD demand for cocaine was beginning to

140
00:08:29.561 --> 00:08:30.670
creep up. However,

141
00:08:30.700 --> 00:08:34.420
it would take a very specific set of circumstances to 10 Coke into the linchpin

142
00:08:34.421 --> 00:08:39.010
of Barry seal's life. A specific set of circumstances in a specific country.

143
00:08:40.000 --> 00:08:42.820
Columbia from the outside Columbia in the early 1970s,

144
00:08:43.030 --> 00:08:46.270
lived relatively stable with a growing economy and little violence,

145
00:08:46.300 --> 00:08:48.520
but this outward appearance mollusks,

146
00:08:48.640 --> 00:08:53.230
a deeply fractured society or power was concentrated in the hands of a tiny

147
00:08:53.231 --> 00:08:56.130
elite since 1957. The country's two major parties.

148
00:08:56.131 --> 00:09:00.030
The liberals and conservatives have been in a power sharing agreements that

149
00:09:00.031 --> 00:09:02.010
blocks everyone else out of politics.

150
00:09:02.130 --> 00:09:06.180
The reason for this had been some of the goals that violencia decade long

151
00:09:06.720 --> 00:09:10.920
undeclared civil war between two parties that had killed 200,000 people.

152
00:09:11.100 --> 00:09:15.150
But while the 1957 agreements that ended the war, the fighting had still left.

153
00:09:15.151 --> 00:09:19.530
The nation deeply traumatized level NCR had been marked by extreme

154
00:09:19.531 --> 00:09:20.220
brutality.

155
00:09:20.220 --> 00:09:24.780
Police were publicly decapitated and their heads used a soccer balls to give

156
00:09:24.810 --> 00:09:26.670
just a single chilling example.

157
00:09:26.730 --> 00:09:30.960
Pablo Escobar had grown up among this spending his first decade in a world of

158
00:09:30.961 --> 00:09:34.080
gruesome lynchings and state sanctioned murder.

159
00:09:34.170 --> 00:09:37.710
He also lived with the aftermath with the economy bottomed out in the early

160
00:09:37.711 --> 00:09:41.700
1960s, as many of the poorest turning to crime to survive yet.

161
00:09:41.701 --> 00:09:45.810
Even this potent mix of traumatized desperately poor people locked out of

162
00:09:45.811 --> 00:09:48.270
political power, might not have exploded.

163
00:09:48.480 --> 00:09:50.880
Had it not been for sheer bad luck,

164
00:09:51.000 --> 00:09:53.790
just as cocaine was starting to bring in serious money.

165
00:09:53.970 --> 00:09:57.060
The traditional Mexican gangs that supplying the States had been driven

166
00:09:57.061 --> 00:09:59.790
underground by a government crackdown down in Columbia.

167
00:09:59.791 --> 00:10:03.900
Web blue was actually produced. Criminal, saw a chance to fill up the void.

168
00:10:03.990 --> 00:10:07.650
The first warning sign of things to come came in November,

169
00:10:07.650 --> 00:10:11.640
1975 when Colombian police seized 600 kilograms of cocaine in retaliation,

170
00:10:11.670 --> 00:10:12.271
drug gangs,

171
00:10:12.271 --> 00:10:16.470
gruesomely murdered 40 people in an event known as the medid massacre,

172
00:10:16.620 --> 00:10:19.500
but the real turning points came in 1977.

173
00:10:20.100 --> 00:10:22.710
The wealthy show of brothers approached Pablo Escobar.

174
00:10:22.740 --> 00:10:27.240
Now a local drug kingpin and are uniting all the gangs in Midian under a single

175
00:10:27.241 --> 00:10:27.990
umbrella group.

176
00:10:27.990 --> 00:10:32.790
One that were control every stage of cocaine from production to trafficking

177
00:10:33.030 --> 00:10:33.863
to distribution.

178
00:10:34.080 --> 00:10:38.760
It was the beginnings of the median cartel soon to become so powerful and so

179
00:10:38.761 --> 00:10:39.391
dangerous.

180
00:10:39.391 --> 00:10:43.770
It made the Sinaloa cartel look like a bunch of promising girls Scouts,

181
00:10:43.860 --> 00:10:47.430
but the median cartel would soon become something else to Barry.

182
00:10:54.770 --> 00:10:55.330
<v 4>How embarrassing.</v>

183
00:10:55.330 --> 00:10:57.860
<v 0>You came to be employed by Escobar. Is there a right place,</v>

184
00:10:57.861 --> 00:11:00.200
right time sort of deal. By 1976,

185
00:11:00.201 --> 00:11:04.760
the disgraced pilot started a smuggling operation flying down to Honduras and

186
00:11:04.761 --> 00:11:05.960
returning with marijuana.

187
00:11:06.050 --> 00:11:09.650
It was small time enough that no one bothered seal allowing him to get plenty of

188
00:11:09.651 --> 00:11:14.300
practice using the legs and buyers of the JAG in Louisiana coastline for drug

189
00:11:14.301 --> 00:11:17.570
drops, but it wasn't small enough to keep them completely under the radar.

190
00:11:17.660 --> 00:11:22.190
In late 1979 seal touchdown in Honduras to find his planes suddenly surrounded

191
00:11:22.191 --> 00:11:25.880
by cops. It was only thanks to dumb luck that he wasn't flying.

192
00:11:25.881 --> 00:11:29.150
And he popped that day. Although police did find an illegal rifle.

193
00:11:29.210 --> 00:11:33.050
Thanks to that rifle. Barry spent the next seven months in a Honduran jail.

194
00:11:33.290 --> 00:11:34.123
Incredibly.

195
00:11:34.190 --> 00:11:37.700
This would actually turn out to be his lucky break on the flight home.

196
00:11:37.730 --> 00:11:41.780
In July of 1980 seal found himself sat next to Roger Reeves,

197
00:11:41.960 --> 00:11:45.710
a professional drug smuggler with connections inside the MedImmune cartel Reeves

198
00:11:45.711 --> 00:11:48.320
was at the forefront of this new era of cocaine.

199
00:11:48.350 --> 00:11:52.640
He told seal how the cartel was investigating an islands and light aircraft.

200
00:11:52.641 --> 00:11:56.230
How small planes would soon become the lifeblood of smuggling.

201
00:11:56.320 --> 00:12:00.100
If seal just happens to know any talented pilots of such aircraft. Well,

202
00:12:00.370 --> 00:12:03.400
that pilots might be able to make themselves a lot of money.

203
00:12:03.550 --> 00:12:07.150
It was an offer that seal couldn't refuse before long barrier seal with

204
00:12:07.151 --> 00:12:09.190
smuggling cocaine for the MedImmune cartel.

205
00:12:09.520 --> 00:12:13.330
And it was everything that Reeves the promised seals income exploded overnight.

206
00:12:13.390 --> 00:12:17.680
By 1983, he would have made over $25 million.

207
00:12:17.770 --> 00:12:21.190
The thing is he was worth it. Even in the early 1980s,

208
00:12:21.191 --> 00:12:25.270
you couldn't just fly into U S airspace from South America and not expect to

209
00:12:25.271 --> 00:12:29.590
receive the deepest cavity search in customs history just have been undetected.

210
00:12:29.680 --> 00:12:33.670
You have to fly so low over the Gulf of Mexico that you were almost touching the

211
00:12:33.671 --> 00:12:37.420
water. And even then you might still get picked up by radar. So yeah,

212
00:12:37.570 --> 00:12:42.070
to fly slow and make sure you came in near where the offshore oil fields were.

213
00:12:42.130 --> 00:12:46.180
So any board air traffic controller who glimpsed you on his screen would assume

214
00:12:46.181 --> 00:12:49.090
you were just a helicopter returning from a rig vitally.

215
00:12:49.120 --> 00:12:51.490
You have to drop your shipment without getting caught. By now.

216
00:12:51.491 --> 00:12:54.430
Barry seal knew the swampy tango coastline of Louisiana,

217
00:12:54.431 --> 00:12:57.700
better than anyone he would fly in at night with his lights off using night

218
00:12:57.701 --> 00:13:02.170
vision goggles to find his way using a walkie-talkie into GPS tracker hit radio

219
00:13:02.290 --> 00:13:04.210
is men and exactly where to find the product.

220
00:13:04.270 --> 00:13:08.560
Then it drop it into the dark Bayou below and fly away into the night sky.

221
00:13:08.710 --> 00:13:11.410
Shortly after a boat would haul the cocaine out of the swamp,

222
00:13:11.411 --> 00:13:14.020
where it would be loaded onto cars and driven to Miami.

223
00:13:14.230 --> 00:13:16.810
It was a complicated setup, but seal pulls it off.

224
00:13:17.080 --> 00:13:20.110
None of his men were caught in the act for the DEA.

225
00:13:20.180 --> 00:13:24.430
Still used to a world where smuggling shoving blowups a mule's and hoping for

226
00:13:24.431 --> 00:13:27.250
the best seal is advanced tactics or left them dizzy.

227
00:13:27.340 --> 00:13:29.050
This was smuggling as an art form,

228
00:13:29.051 --> 00:13:31.750
designed to impress seals employers and met a year.

229
00:13:31.990 --> 00:13:34.360
Not that seal had ever met the guy who's paying his salary.

230
00:13:34.510 --> 00:13:37.540
All of seals contacts with the cartel had been through intermediaries.

231
00:13:37.720 --> 00:13:39.670
Pablo Escobar had never seen a picture of him.

232
00:13:39.760 --> 00:13:44.410
Never heard his real name only is alias El Gordo or the fat man.

233
00:13:44.620 --> 00:13:47.890
It would be this crucial missing piece of information that would both spare

234
00:13:47.891 --> 00:13:52.180
Barry seal a lifetime in prison and sign his death sentence.

235
00:13:56.940 --> 00:13:57.773
<v 5>[Inaudible].</v>

236
00:13:58.950 --> 00:13:59.880
<v 0>Lucille was a clever smuggler.</v>

237
00:13:59.910 --> 00:14:04.230
He wasn't as clever as he thought he was for one thing while seal knew to use

238
00:14:04.231 --> 00:14:06.120
only payphones to contact people.

239
00:14:06.270 --> 00:14:09.750
He was far too lazy to keep randomly choosing new payphones.

240
00:14:09.780 --> 00:14:12.690
So when the DEA decided to start collecting info on him,

241
00:14:12.691 --> 00:14:16.830
they simply wiretapped the 10 payphones that he used the most and built their

242
00:14:16.831 --> 00:14:18.870
case that way for another barrier seal,

243
00:14:18.871 --> 00:14:21.870
also like to boast to anyone and everyone,

244
00:14:21.930 --> 00:14:25.380
it was this last trait that would destroy his life. In 1981,

245
00:14:25.381 --> 00:14:28.770
a DEA agent wearing a wire, walked into a Baton Rouge bar,

246
00:14:28.950 --> 00:14:31.530
went up to Barry seal and was all like, Hey,

247
00:14:31.531 --> 00:14:34.320
you don't like the sort of phone guy that has really awesome stories about

248
00:14:34.321 --> 00:14:37.350
smuggling drugs with a blue Escobar. Want to tell me about them? I mean,

249
00:14:37.560 --> 00:14:40.740
if you could lean in towards me and speak clearly,

250
00:14:40.980 --> 00:14:42.750
that would also be super helpful.

251
00:14:42.930 --> 00:14:47.610
Incredibly this word seal started spouting off his mouth and ended the

252
00:14:47.611 --> 00:14:51.090
conversation promising the undercover agent that it smuggles in Briggs.

253
00:14:51.560 --> 00:14:53.180
It was the beginning of the endless,

254
00:14:53.270 --> 00:14:58.070
although the DEA and FBI would need over another year to build an airtight case.

255
00:14:58.370 --> 00:15:01.820
That one conversation was the start of Barry seal's downfall.

256
00:15:01.970 --> 00:15:04.910
The boot finally dropped in March of 1983.

257
00:15:05.000 --> 00:15:09.310
That month seal was indicted for cocaine smuggling. The following year, March,

258
00:15:09.310 --> 00:15:12.560
1984, the trial began a 10 year sentence hovering over his head.

259
00:15:12.710 --> 00:15:17.030
That's a long decade of boredom of being stuck behind bars away from

260
00:15:17.031 --> 00:15:21.650
flying away from the life that seal loved so much panics seal

261
00:15:21.680 --> 00:15:26.120
promised to turn informants to give the DEA, whatever they want it. Oh,

262
00:15:26.510 --> 00:15:30.410
we like to think the DEA agents chuckles Amar, can you give us?

263
00:15:30.560 --> 00:15:34.730
And seal's answer was Pablo Escobar. It was a desperate gamble.

264
00:15:34.880 --> 00:15:37.040
Although seal works for the MedImmune cocktail.

265
00:15:37.040 --> 00:15:41.720
I'd never met Escobar had no idea how to even go about setting the drug Lord up.

266
00:15:41.930 --> 00:15:46.400
The DEA were likewise unconvinced. They shoved CLF phone and basically said,

267
00:15:46.460 --> 00:15:49.550
go and then breathe it. So seal call to connection.

268
00:15:49.670 --> 00:15:52.520
And the cartel pretended to be a pilot called Ellis McKenzie,

269
00:15:52.521 --> 00:15:56.210
who was super into the idea of flying enormous quantities of Coke to the USA.

270
00:15:56.270 --> 00:15:58.250
Somehow the desperate bluff worked.

271
00:15:58.280 --> 00:16:02.510
The connection agreed to set up a meeting between seal and Escobar himself.

272
00:16:02.600 --> 00:16:06.410
Suddenly the DEA was no longer just looking at Navigant American smuggler,

273
00:16:06.411 --> 00:16:10.850
but dismantling the entire Meridian in cartel based with such a prize.

274
00:16:10.851 --> 00:16:14.660
They agree to plea deal on the 8th of April, 1984 seal walk,

275
00:16:14.870 --> 00:16:18.920
take semi free man onto an American airfield and took off for Columbia that

276
00:16:18.921 --> 00:16:19.251
evening.

277
00:16:19.251 --> 00:16:23.180
He found himself at the Choa brother's estate face-to-face with the entire

278
00:16:23.181 --> 00:16:24.200
cartel leadership.

279
00:16:24.470 --> 00:16:28.160
It was the first time the DEA informants had ever met Escobar face to face.

280
00:16:28.220 --> 00:16:32.930
Luckily Escobar had no idea unless McKenzie was the same person as their older

281
00:16:32.931 --> 00:16:36.050
pilot, El Gordo had been enamored by the Americans.

282
00:16:36.080 --> 00:16:38.510
The drug Lord outlined his plans do Ellis.

283
00:16:38.540 --> 00:16:42.890
He would fly 15,000 kilograms of cocaine to America and preparation for selling

284
00:16:42.980 --> 00:16:46.040
it. The 1984 Olympics to load up. He wouldn't come to Columbia,

285
00:16:46.041 --> 00:16:47.930
but to a military base in Nicaragua,

286
00:16:48.110 --> 00:16:50.990
which the Sandinista regime was renting out to Escobar.

287
00:16:51.050 --> 00:16:55.070
This all sounded fine to seal who must've been desperate just to get the meeting

288
00:16:55.071 --> 00:16:58.280
concluded and get out of that. But if it all sounded fine to him,

289
00:16:58.310 --> 00:17:02.240
it was going to sound way more than just fine to the CIA.

290
00:17:02.300 --> 00:17:05.000
When word got to the agency about Barry seal's adventure,

291
00:17:05.030 --> 00:17:06.110
things were going to get crazy.

292
00:17:06.850 --> 00:17:07.683
<v 6>Never.</v>

293
00:17:13.810 --> 00:17:16.180
<v 0>To unravel when seal first fluids in Nicaragua.</v>

294
00:17:16.210 --> 00:17:19.300
Although the Midian cartel had supposedly cleared it with the Sandinista

295
00:17:19.301 --> 00:17:20.020
government.

296
00:17:20.020 --> 00:17:23.740
Someone had forgotten to tell the troops on the ground seal was shot down over

297
00:17:23.741 --> 00:17:26.590
the jungle, arrested and thrown in, in the Karakia in jail.

298
00:17:26.770 --> 00:17:29.680
While Escobar's contacts within the government would get him released it.

299
00:17:29.681 --> 00:17:33.610
Unfortunately wouldn't be before the DEA found out, unfortunately,

300
00:17:33.611 --> 00:17:36.190
the da wouldn't be able to spring seal by themselves.

301
00:17:36.250 --> 00:17:40.150
Instead they contacted the CIA for help only to watch the case be taken out of

302
00:17:40.151 --> 00:17:43.600
their hands at the moment. Barry seal crash landed in Nicaragua.

303
00:17:43.750 --> 00:17:47.110
The Sandinista government was American enemy. Number one,

304
00:17:47.230 --> 00:17:51.120
a bunch of left-wing rebels overthrown Nicaragua's dictator.

305
00:17:51.121 --> 00:17:55.800
The Sandinistas were close to both Cuba and the Soviet union as a result of the

306
00:17:55.801 --> 00:17:59.580
CIA and the white house had spent years trying to discredit them even illegally

307
00:17:59.581 --> 00:18:03.810
funding, right wing death squads, known as Contreras to wage a brutal civil war.

308
00:18:03.870 --> 00:18:07.170
But while the American public already knew the Sandinistas were communists,

309
00:18:07.171 --> 00:18:10.140
they didn't know they were also cocaine traffickers.

310
00:18:10.200 --> 00:18:14.220
If the CIA could prove this support for regime change would surely grow.

311
00:18:14.360 --> 00:18:17.700
But the upshot was that once Barry seal arrived back in the United States,

312
00:18:18.000 --> 00:18:20.460
it was to find his mission had changed no longer.

313
00:18:20.461 --> 00:18:23.670
Was he going to just act as DEA mole in the medium cartel,

314
00:18:23.820 --> 00:18:28.080
he was going to have to use secret cameras to photograph the massive drug deal

315
00:18:28.200 --> 00:18:31.710
seal, begs them not to make him do this. He knew the MedImmune cartel.

316
00:18:31.770 --> 00:18:34.710
He knew what they would do to him. If they suspected he was an informant.

317
00:18:34.770 --> 00:18:37.710
If he was lucky, they might shoot him. If he was unlucky,

318
00:18:38.160 --> 00:18:41.730
that slowly tortured him to death and leave his mutilated body hanging from a

319
00:18:41.731 --> 00:18:44.820
tree. But the CIA would determined either seal,

320
00:18:44.850 --> 00:18:49.500
take these photos or go straight to prison. On June the 26th, 1984,

321
00:18:49.800 --> 00:18:50.521
Barry seal boarded,

322
00:18:50.521 --> 00:18:54.060
a plane equipped with two hidden cameras and flew back to Nicaragua.

323
00:18:54.150 --> 00:18:57.270
It was likely the longest day of his entire life.

324
00:18:57.300 --> 00:19:01.290
When seal landed in the fields, he was immediately surrounded by armed soldiers.

325
00:19:01.410 --> 00:19:04.770
Then one of the secret cameras, malfunctioned and started making loud noises,

326
00:19:05.070 --> 00:19:08.730
meaning see, I'll have to find an excuse to gum the engines to cover the sounds.

327
00:19:08.820 --> 00:19:12.750
But the most heart-stopping moments was likely when a vehicle pulled up next to

328
00:19:12.751 --> 00:19:16.500
the plane, then out step to Pablo Escobar. For whatever reason,

329
00:19:16.501 --> 00:19:19.500
the drug Lord himself has come to not just watch the loading,

330
00:19:19.501 --> 00:19:23.040
but personally helped through duffle bags of cocaine into the hangar.

331
00:19:23.130 --> 00:19:26.010
It was Barry seal's death sentence. Oh sure.

332
00:19:26.011 --> 00:19:27.660
He would physically live a while longer,

333
00:19:27.720 --> 00:19:31.800
long enough to fly his plane back to the U S but the moment Escobar was caught

334
00:19:31.801 --> 00:19:32.520
on camera.

335
00:19:32.520 --> 00:19:37.400
Sack of cocaine in hand seal was as dead as a man who knowingly

336
00:19:37.401 --> 00:19:41.660
has terminal cancer. When the CIA saw seals photos, they were ecstatic.

337
00:19:41.690 --> 00:19:42.620
So ecstatic.

338
00:19:42.621 --> 00:19:47.480
They promptly leaked them to the press blowing sales cover by mid July, 1984,

339
00:19:47.510 --> 00:19:50.570
the Medellin cartel placed a million dollar bounty on seals. Hat.

340
00:19:50.810 --> 00:19:53.510
This would be bad enough if seal were able to go into hiding,

341
00:19:54.110 --> 00:19:56.240
he still needed to make his court date. On January.

342
00:19:56.241 --> 00:20:00.770
The 20th was 1986 seal went on trial in Baton Rouge for smuggling cocaine.

343
00:20:00.830 --> 00:20:03.830
While his plea deal mentors maximum sentence was fairly low.

344
00:20:04.070 --> 00:20:07.670
The judge still decided to go all out. Neil was sentenced to six months,

345
00:20:07.671 --> 00:20:09.770
community service in a salvation army center.

346
00:20:10.010 --> 00:20:14.270
It would be forbidden from carrying a gun forbidden from protecting himself from

347
00:20:14.271 --> 00:20:17.960
the wrath of Escobar. And then the judge did something so utterly stupid.

348
00:20:18.350 --> 00:20:21.590
It's tempting to think that it was deliberate there in open court.

349
00:20:21.740 --> 00:20:23.720
The judge read out the address of the center.

350
00:20:24.050 --> 00:20:25.880
Barry seal would spend six months in it.

351
00:20:25.881 --> 00:20:29.690
Doesn't take a genius to figure out what happened next. A couple of weeks later,

352
00:20:29.691 --> 00:20:32.840
a gang of Colombian hitmen crossed into the United States and headed up to

353
00:20:32.841 --> 00:20:35.480
Louisiana on February the 19th, 1986,

354
00:20:35.510 --> 00:20:39.320
Barry seal pulls his car into its parking Bay outside the salvation army sends

355
00:20:39.500 --> 00:20:41.180
up before he could open the door to Hitman.

356
00:20:41.181 --> 00:20:44.480
Calmly walked over and aimed there's some machine guns at long.

357
00:20:44.481 --> 00:20:49.450
Last Barry seal's legendary luck had run out seal was dead even before

358
00:20:49.451 --> 00:20:52.990
the men finished firing. Although the authorities would cash as assassins.

359
00:20:53.260 --> 00:20:57.370
The game was still over down South Pablo Escobar would evade justice for another

360
00:20:57.371 --> 00:21:01.270
seven years bringing Columbia to its knees before finally getting gunned down

361
00:21:01.271 --> 00:21:05.080
himself on a MedImmune rooftop in Nicaragua with the CIA's attempts to

362
00:21:05.081 --> 00:21:06.910
destabilize the Sandinistas failed.

363
00:21:07.090 --> 00:21:11.740
The party remained in power until 1990 before returning to government in 2006 at

364
00:21:11.741 --> 00:21:16.300
the time of writing best still Nicaragua's leading political party as for the

365
00:21:16.301 --> 00:21:21.220
war on drugs. Well, it relocated Columbia today is relatively peaceful,

366
00:21:21.250 --> 00:21:25.990
but you only have to look at Mexico to see drug violence is still very much with

367
00:21:25.991 --> 00:21:27.730
us, but what of Barry seal? Well,

368
00:21:27.731 --> 00:21:32.230
even now he remains a fascinating figure and immoral adventurer with a near

369
00:21:32.231 --> 00:21:34.570
suicidal disregard for his own safety.

370
00:21:34.960 --> 00:21:38.410
But he's also interesting for another reason for two or three short years,

371
00:21:38.800 --> 00:21:41.290
seal stood at the very center of the war on drugs.

372
00:21:41.320 --> 00:21:45.160
The point West smuggling politics, poverty, desperation, and underhand,

373
00:21:45.161 --> 00:21:46.150
CIA tactics,

374
00:21:46.151 --> 00:21:50.470
all met his actions had consequences that stretched all the way up to the Reagan

375
00:21:50.471 --> 00:21:55.090
white house that echoed through Bogota's corridors of power for years to come.

376
00:21:55.420 --> 00:21:59.080
Certainly not bad for a fat kid from Baton Rouge.

377
00:21:59.320 --> 00:22:03.610
Barry seal may have been a loud mouth, a show off and a convicted drug smuggler,

378
00:22:03.760 --> 00:22:08.350
but he was also a man willing to pay almost any price for an interesting life.

379
00:22:08.530 --> 00:22:13.150
It's fitting. Then that's in the end, the price he paid was the ultimate one.

380
00:22:13.780 --> 00:22:15.580
