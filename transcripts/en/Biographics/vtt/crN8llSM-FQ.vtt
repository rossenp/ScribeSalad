Squarespace through the link in the description below more on that in a bit,

00:00:21.560 --> 00:00:25.040
He was not an obvious heartthrob like Elvis.

6
00:00:25.070 --> 00:00:30.050
He was not an early guitar hero like Chuck Berry has professional musical

7
00:00:30.051 --> 00:00:32.330
career. Didn't even last two years,

8
00:00:32.480 --> 00:00:36.590
despite all that his legacy is enormous. He's considered one of,

9
00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:41.570
if not the most influential artists of the early rock and roll years.

10
00:00:41.780 --> 00:00:45.350
This is the story of buddy Holly and his stellar rise.

11
00:00:52.040 --> 00:00:52.130
<v 1>[Inaudible].</v>

12
00:00:52.130 --> 00:00:54.800
<v 0>Buddy Holly was born Charles Hart and Holly in Lubbock,</v>

13
00:00:54.830 --> 00:00:58.250
Texas on 7th of September, 1936 from parents,

14
00:00:58.550 --> 00:01:03.440
Ella Drake and L Oh Holly, still spelled with an E mum, Holly and sister,

15
00:01:03.441 --> 00:01:06.050
that all our kids played an instrument from an early age.

16
00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:09.530
The families' little orchestra due to Larry born in 1925,

17
00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:11.150
Travis 1927,

18
00:01:11.151 --> 00:01:15.230
Patricia Lou in 1929 as the much younger child,

19
00:01:15.231 --> 00:01:19.520
Charles became known as the buddy to his parents and siblings alike on paper

20
00:01:19.580 --> 00:01:24.380
Lubbock in the 1930s made for the perfect setting in a grim

21
00:01:24.410 --> 00:01:27.710
Steinbeck novel. It had been hit hard by the great depression,

22
00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:30.830
but buddy's early years were nothing to get depressed about.

23
00:01:30.860 --> 00:01:33.830
He was spoiled and indulged by his parents and siblings,

24
00:01:33.831 --> 00:01:38.270
especially Larry and Travis. And he worshiped his heroes when buddy was five,

25
00:01:38.271 --> 00:01:41.930
his older brothers, Larry and Travis took him to perform at a local talent show.

26
00:01:41.960 --> 00:01:45.320
Buddy was given a toy violin smeared with grease so that it wouldn't make a

27
00:01:45.321 --> 00:01:45.860
sound.

28
00:01:45.860 --> 00:01:50.060
The judges were so taken with the cute kid playing alongside his big brothers,

29
00:01:50.061 --> 00:01:53.660
that the Holly's one to $5 prize, not long after that success,

30
00:01:53.661 --> 00:01:56.120
the water Larry and Travis away from Lubbock.

31
00:01:56.150 --> 00:01:59.900
They both enlisted in the Marines and fought in the Pacific with Travis being

32
00:01:59.901 --> 00:02:04.280
one of the lucky ones who stormed into a Jima and survived at the end of the

33
00:02:04.281 --> 00:02:04.520
war.

34
00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:09.380
Both big brothers were safely back home and drivers had brought a present back

35
00:02:09.381 --> 00:02:11.540
for buddy and acoustic guitar.

36
00:02:11.720 --> 00:02:14.930
Travis taught him the basics and before long buddy was out playing and

37
00:02:15.140 --> 00:02:16.760
correcting his teacher from then on,

38
00:02:16.761 --> 00:02:20.420
he would hardly be seen without a guitar in his hands learning and mastering his

39
00:02:20.421 --> 00:02:24.530
three favorite styles. First, the most popular genre in Texas country,

40
00:02:24.531 --> 00:02:28.880
Western Hank Williams and his yodeling Vogels had a big impact on buddy's later

41
00:02:28.890 --> 00:02:31.430
singing style. Then there was bluegrass their style,

42
00:02:31.431 --> 00:02:34.220
which he discovered thanks to his best friend, Bob Montgomery,

43
00:02:34.280 --> 00:02:36.770
bluegrass relied on traditional string instruments,

44
00:02:36.771 --> 00:02:38.870
such as banjo mandolin and fiddle.

45
00:02:39.200 --> 00:02:43.760
And example of a bluegrass tune is the traditional dueling banjos listening,

46
00:02:44.090 --> 00:02:46.670
not recommended. If you're preparing to go on a canoeing trip,

47
00:02:46.940 --> 00:02:51.020
the final influence was rhythm and blues at that time played in tiny by black

48
00:02:51.021 --> 00:02:54.020
artists with the enjoyments of mostly black audiences,

49
00:02:54.110 --> 00:02:57.940
R and B was not considered respectable for decent young white boys.

50
00:02:57.970 --> 00:03:01.210
Listen to Lubbock was a segregated town in the 1940s,

51
00:03:01.211 --> 00:03:06.010
a result of a 1928 ordinance that prohibited persons with more than one 10th

52
00:03:06.011 --> 00:03:10.240
Negro blood from living West of Avenue D yet buddy and his friend,

53
00:03:10.241 --> 00:03:13.870
Bob would sneak into their parents' cars to listen to R and B shows on the

54
00:03:13.871 --> 00:03:15.340
radio. When they grew older,

55
00:03:15.370 --> 00:03:19.210
they would frequent the clubs East of Avenue D to listen to black artists,

56
00:03:19.240 --> 00:03:23.170
but he was attracted to the rougher edge of B the one more like traditional

57
00:03:23.171 --> 00:03:25.930
guitar driven blues, but when it came time to play live,

58
00:03:25.931 --> 00:03:28.960
he still stuck to white genres. By 1951,

59
00:03:28.990 --> 00:03:30.910
buddy was performing steadily with his friends,

60
00:03:30.911 --> 00:03:34.780
plucking a banjo or mandolin and providing background vocals.

61
00:03:34.870 --> 00:03:39.490
He had recently turned 15 and his hormones had errands acne or in full

62
00:03:39.491 --> 00:03:40.000
bloom.

63
00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:43.960
The last thing buddy needed was poor results from an optometrist appointments,

64
00:03:44.200 --> 00:03:48.760
which is where the young musician was told that what most people saw from 800

65
00:03:48.761 --> 00:03:52.480
feet away, he saw from 20 feet away. In other words, buddy,

66
00:03:52.481 --> 00:03:55.720
Holly was legally blind and he would need to wear glasses,

67
00:03:55.810 --> 00:03:59.410
not the kinds so thick that they might spark a bully's attack. Mind you.

68
00:03:59.530 --> 00:04:03.430
This was the kind of things that they could be used as a fast starting weapon

69
00:04:03.670 --> 00:04:07.360
against said bully. But buddy did not make much of a fast about it.

70
00:04:08.050 --> 00:04:10.870
Stereotype society never risked being the target of any bullying.

71
00:04:11.110 --> 00:04:14.890
As we'll see later, if you ever faced violence, it was for being too popular.

72
00:04:15.040 --> 00:04:18.880
The young Holly had also started experimenting with sex dating several of the

73
00:04:19.090 --> 00:04:20.380
wrong sort of girls,

74
00:04:20.381 --> 00:04:24.250
which in Lubbock may simply mean that they belonged to another congregation.

75
00:04:24.550 --> 00:04:28.210
One of these girls was buddy's first love economic guar, a family.

76
00:04:28.270 --> 00:04:30.220
It was part of the church of Christ, a sec.

77
00:04:30.250 --> 00:04:35.020
So strict that it regarded music as the work of the devil girls who shaved their

78
00:04:35.021 --> 00:04:39.520
legs were regarded as fallen. Women and dancing was strictly forbidden.

79
00:04:39.640 --> 00:04:44.530
I suppose they were just begging for Kevin Bagans come along and set everybody

80
00:04:44.531 --> 00:04:49.510
Footloose. But instead of bacon buddy and Bob came along, both friends, fancied,

81
00:04:49.900 --> 00:04:54.040
ACO, and both had asked her out, but buddy was the more insistence that goes.

82
00:04:54.041 --> 00:04:56.470
Mum thought her daughter was too young to go steady.

83
00:04:56.471 --> 00:04:59.050
So she agreed for buddy and accurate to go on dates,

84
00:04:59.051 --> 00:05:02.590
but only if she dated Bob to slightly puzzling,

85
00:05:02.620 --> 00:05:06.550
but that's how some things go, buddy, on Friday, Bob on Saturday,

86
00:05:06.640 --> 00:05:10.810
before you wonder how and why such a devout mother of the church of Christ would

87
00:05:10.990 --> 00:05:15.400
not share a daughter towards bigamy consider that the relationships with echo

88
00:05:15.760 --> 00:05:18.190
will always Chast by spring of 1953,

89
00:05:18.191 --> 00:05:22.510
buddy had eventually convinced the McGuires to let go of the awkward deal.

90
00:05:22.660 --> 00:05:26.110
The echo dumped Bob and she and buddy became a permanent item,

91
00:05:26.350 --> 00:05:29.380
but I felt a bit sorry for Bobby. And not only had he been doubled by echo,

92
00:05:29.381 --> 00:05:31.750
but it also splits with his best friend,

93
00:05:31.810 --> 00:05:35.200
but he had been drifting more and more towards R and B while Bob was still

94
00:05:35.201 --> 00:05:39.280
rooted in bluegrass buddy now sorts and new chum to strum with.

95
00:05:39.281 --> 00:05:43.030
And he found one in Jack Neil young pop into whacking with dat Holly,

96
00:05:43.300 --> 00:05:44.320
as they played together,

97
00:05:44.321 --> 00:05:47.440
buddy ditched his mandolin and banjo and switched to lead guitar.

98
00:05:47.620 --> 00:05:51.970
Neil also composed his own material and may have been a direct influence on

99
00:05:52.360 --> 00:05:56.230
buddy songwriting after badgering, local radio celebrity, DJ Pappy,

100
00:05:56.231 --> 00:06:01.060
Dave buddy and Jack were invited to play live on station on

101
00:06:01.061 --> 00:06:05.350
November the fourth, 1953, the duo played four songs. The reception was 17.

102
00:06:06.100 --> 00:06:06.250
Fantastic.

103
00:06:06.250 --> 00:06:10.390
The copy Dave created an entire weekly salt for them buddy and Jackson.

104
00:06:10.400 --> 00:06:11.410
Sunday party

105
00:06:18.140 --> 00:06:21.940
year of successful performances buddy had greatly improved his guitar skills and

106
00:06:22.270 --> 00:06:25.120
had switched from acoustic to electric, wielding a Gibson,

107
00:06:25.121 --> 00:06:29.080
Les Paul gold top around that period, Jack married and moved to New Mexico,

108
00:06:29.081 --> 00:06:32.590
which prompted buddy to recruit as old pal Bob Montgomery, his lead singer,

109
00:06:32.800 --> 00:06:34.420
the two were joins by basis.

110
00:06:34.450 --> 00:06:38.590
Larry Wellborn and Sonny Curtis to jazz guitarist and composer who greatly

111
00:06:38.591 --> 00:06:42.190
expanded buddy's musical vocabulary by the end of his bands were a few weeks

112
00:06:42.191 --> 00:06:47.110
away from the greatest epiphany of their lives on January the second, 1955.

113
00:06:47.320 --> 00:06:47.321
Kay,

114
00:06:47.321 --> 00:06:51.280
DAV organized a live show with a couple of young musicians that you may have

115
00:06:51.281 --> 00:06:55.990
heard of Johnny Cash and Elvis Presley. Elvis is performance hit buddy,

116
00:06:56.170 --> 00:07:01.030
like an H bomb Elvis dad's record a country single with an B piece on the B

117
00:07:01.420 --> 00:07:06.190
side. Elvis made the girls ecstatic with a soulful vocals and energetic beats

118
00:07:06.280 --> 00:07:10.870
Elvis horrified parents with his gyrating pelvis and his love of black

119
00:07:10.871 --> 00:07:13.270
music. Buddy wanted a piece of that action.

120
00:07:13.360 --> 00:07:16.960
This was when he decided to ditch bluegrass once and for all and focus his

121
00:07:16.961 --> 00:07:20.590
talents on R and B and rock and roll. The other guys in the bands were game.

122
00:07:20.680 --> 00:07:22.630
They did not dig the music 100%,

123
00:07:22.631 --> 00:07:25.630
but surely enjoy the effect that it had on the ladies.

124
00:07:25.780 --> 00:07:28.210
Bob's voice was ill suited for rock and roll.

125
00:07:28.211 --> 00:07:31.630
So the young Holly was promoted to lead vocalist in this new role,

126
00:07:31.660 --> 00:07:36.160
buddy abandoned his usual gentlemen Lee restraints and went wild. Well,

127
00:07:36.161 --> 00:07:38.440
at least in front of his audience offstage,

128
00:07:38.441 --> 00:07:42.880
he remained his usual self outwardly shy, but quietly confidence. Now,

129
00:07:43.150 --> 00:07:46.690
buddy and Bob needed a drummer country and bluegrass ensembles could work

130
00:07:46.691 --> 00:07:49.300
perfectly without a drummer, but if you wanted rock and roll,

131
00:07:49.510 --> 00:07:54.430
you needed someone to hit those skins. And in June of 1955,

132
00:07:54.580 --> 00:07:59.020
they found someone who could hit them. Good. This was teenage drama,

133
00:07:59.740 --> 00:08:03.460
Jerry JJ, Alison, he wasn't yet old enough to legally enter clubs.

134
00:08:03.461 --> 00:08:07.420
Yet he had more experience playing live than his old band mates. Moreover,

135
00:08:07.421 --> 00:08:10.240
he could handle jazz pop country and R and B with ease.

136
00:08:10.390 --> 00:08:14.620
Jerry would prove to be buddy's most valuable musical ally that summer,

137
00:08:14.650 --> 00:08:17.230
his girlfriend's echo was a way of getting ready for college.

138
00:08:17.350 --> 00:08:20.710
During this period, he developed his signature finger-picking style,

139
00:08:20.711 --> 00:08:23.230
which allowed him to play rhythm and lead parts.

140
00:08:23.231 --> 00:08:27.130
Simultaneously buddy perfected this technique while rehearsing with Jerry for an

141
00:08:27.131 --> 00:08:27.964
hours on ends.

142
00:08:27.970 --> 00:08:32.260
The two had developed a symbiotic musical style and each one was able to guess

143
00:08:32.261 --> 00:08:35.200
what the other was going to play next. After rehearsing by day,

144
00:08:35.201 --> 00:08:39.160
the bands played increasingly crowded gigs as a front man buddy had become so

145
00:08:39.161 --> 00:08:43.180
popular in Lubbock that every girl wanted to STEM some lipstick on his face and

146
00:08:43.390 --> 00:08:47.110
their boyfriends wanted to stand Bay or right hook on his jaw.

147
00:08:47.140 --> 00:08:51.040
There are stories of such boyfriends wanting to jump buddy and just made Sony to

148
00:08:51.041 --> 00:08:54.730
be foiled by the intervention of their bodyguards buddies, older brothers,

149
00:08:54.930 --> 00:08:58.110
Larry and Travis. It gives you a powerful sense of security.

150
00:08:58.350 --> 00:09:01.320
When you're body guards have stormed in a Jima the year 90,

151
00:09:01.321 --> 00:09:04.740
55 had more gifts packed for young buddy on October,

152
00:09:04.741 --> 00:09:07.770
the 14th bill Haley and the comments came to play in Lubbock.

153
00:09:07.980 --> 00:09:09.000
They hit rock around.

154
00:09:09.001 --> 00:09:12.210
The clock has been the first rock and roll record to reach number one on the

155
00:09:12.211 --> 00:09:15.420
charts and buddy and Bob, the owner to open for the comments.

156
00:09:15.480 --> 00:09:17.980
That's when they were noticed by Eddie Crandall,

157
00:09:18.180 --> 00:09:22.410
talent Scouts from the American music Capitol Nashville, the following nights,

158
00:09:22.411 --> 00:09:26.160
buddy and Bob were at Katie AAV playing a set with Elvis Crandall was there

159
00:09:26.161 --> 00:09:28.650
again. And he suggested to Elvis's manager,

160
00:09:28.710 --> 00:09:32.100
Colonel Parker that he signed them up. Parker liked those kids,

161
00:09:32.101 --> 00:09:33.840
but he was too busy with Presley.

162
00:09:33.870 --> 00:09:37.110
So why didn't Crandall put them under contracts.

163
00:09:37.200 --> 00:09:39.720
Developments began happening very quickly for buddy Holly,

164
00:09:39.721 --> 00:09:41.040
faster than a rollercoaster.

165
00:09:41.220 --> 00:09:44.760
A few weeks later on December the seventh buddy in the band recorded a demo of

166
00:09:44.761 --> 00:09:47.430
his own original compositions and sent it to Nashville.

167
00:09:47.460 --> 00:09:50.190
They were waiting for a small label, Cedar wood to get back to them,

168
00:09:50.400 --> 00:09:54.840
but they didn't hear from them. Instead. They heard from a major label DECA.

169
00:09:54.960 --> 00:09:59.880
These were the big guys and his buddy was about to make it big time. Now,

170
00:09:59.881 --> 00:10:03.990
if you're thinking of a musical career dreaming of the big time, well,

171
00:10:03.991 --> 00:10:07.170
let me tell you what you're going to need a website, but maybe a non-musician,

172
00:10:07.171 --> 00:10:09.960
but whatever you're doing online, you need a website.

173
00:10:09.961 --> 00:10:12.420
And that brings me to today's sponsor Squarespace. Now,

174
00:10:12.421 --> 00:10:13.350
a couple of simple things,

175
00:10:13.351 --> 00:10:16.530
maybe you've got some idea you want to get your bands out there,

176
00:10:16.531 --> 00:10:20.880
or maybe you just want to start a business or a podcast or something like that.

177
00:10:20.880 --> 00:10:21.150
Well,

178
00:10:21.150 --> 00:10:24.270
the second thing is the only way to figure out whether that idea is worth doing

179
00:10:24.271 --> 00:10:27.930
is to get it out there to the world, get people, listening to your music,

180
00:10:28.080 --> 00:10:31.440
to continue the analogy, but this could be daunting because you know,

181
00:10:31.470 --> 00:10:35.280
it's scary to go and pursue new things, but not knowing how to set up a website.

182
00:10:35.850 --> 00:10:39.870
That shouldn't be an excuse and there are no excuses available with Squarespace.

183
00:10:40.020 --> 00:10:43.470
Squarespace allows you to create a powerful website for whatever you're up to.

184
00:10:43.650 --> 00:10:48.300
You want to sell something online? Yes. Easy to set up a store with Squarespace.

185
00:10:48.450 --> 00:10:52.230
You want to do a podcast? Sure. They handle that too.

186
00:10:52.440 --> 00:10:56.880
It all starts on Squarespace with a beautiful template that you can customize to

187
00:10:56.881 --> 00:10:57.870
your heart's content.

188
00:10:57.960 --> 00:11:01.800
Or you can start from scratch or you can move over from an existing domain,

189
00:11:01.830 --> 00:11:04.500
but you know, don't make any excuses for yourself.

190
00:11:04.530 --> 00:11:07.200
Just take one of that beautiful templates and roll with it.

191
00:11:07.380 --> 00:11:11.310
And once you've gone through the customization process, no updates, no patches,

192
00:11:11.550 --> 00:11:15.300
no tech BS to deal with on Squarespace, little stands.

193
00:11:15.350 --> 00:11:19.410
All the website is stuff made in a social media podcasts already said that.

194
00:11:19.770 --> 00:11:22.500
And a lot more, like I say, Squarespace,

195
00:11:22.740 --> 00:11:25.410

00:11:42.320 --> 00:11:42.410
<v 1>[Inaudible].</v>

200
00:11:42.410 --> 00:11:44.300
<v 0>On January the sixth, 1956,</v>

201
00:11:44.330 --> 00:11:48.380
buddy and co were in Nashville for a recording session with a big change in

202
00:11:48.381 --> 00:11:51.260
lineup. Deco wanted to sign a solo artist yet.

203
00:11:51.290 --> 00:11:55.390
So the act was called buddy and Bob buddy protested saying that if Bob was not

204
00:11:55.810 --> 00:11:57.700
builder, then he would not sign any contract.

205
00:11:57.760 --> 00:12:00.940
It was Bob who actually solved the impulse by quitting the band.

206
00:12:01.000 --> 00:12:04.870
He actually went on to have his own successful career as a solo artist. Anyway,

207
00:12:04.900 --> 00:12:09.010
that Nashville recording session produced buddy's first single blue days,

208
00:12:09.190 --> 00:12:12.670
black nights by that whole DECA was happy with the single lens.

209
00:12:12.690 --> 00:12:13.990
Put buddy under contract,

210
00:12:14.020 --> 00:12:17.470
the DECA type has dropped in in documents and that's how buddy Holly was.

211
00:12:17.471 --> 00:12:20.200
And he became buddy Holly without the aid.

212
00:12:20.320 --> 00:12:23.320
However of deco was happy about the records. They didn't.

213
00:12:23.320 --> 00:12:25.480
<v 2>Exactly show it. They barely promoted.</v>

214
00:12:25.480 --> 00:12:28.510
<v 0>It and sold only 18,000 copies in general,</v>

215
00:12:28.511 --> 00:12:32.850
buddy felt a little short changed by these major label types. The biopic,

216
00:12:32.880 --> 00:12:36.600
the buddy Holly story has a scene in which the protagonist punches a DECA

217
00:12:36.601 --> 00:12:40.860
producer meddling with his own recording sessions. None of that's ever happens,

218
00:12:40.861 --> 00:12:44.190
but it's nonetheless an accurate representation of the strange relationship that

219
00:12:44.191 --> 00:12:47.010
buddy had with the label. Even after the first session,

220
00:12:47.400 --> 00:12:51.300
DECA would frequently utilize their own studio musicians over buddies pals.

221
00:12:51.301 --> 00:12:54.810
They would ask him to change his singing style to a more traditional one.

222
00:12:54.840 --> 00:12:58.350
They would even forbid him from playing the guitar on records.

223
00:12:58.470 --> 00:13:02.970
That's why between February and April buddy in the bands drove to Clovis New

224
00:13:02.970 --> 00:13:06.510
Mexico for some self-funded sessions in the studio owned by musician and

225
00:13:06.511 --> 00:13:07.860
producer Norman petty.

226
00:13:07.920 --> 00:13:12.030
It was at this studio that buddy and Jerry composed a great track that will be

227
00:13:12.031 --> 00:13:16.440
the day inspired by John Wayne's catchphrase and the Western film, the searches,

228
00:13:16.590 --> 00:13:20.250
the bands proudly proposed the tune to Dhaka, but that produces spoils.

229
00:13:20.280 --> 00:13:22.980
What was a killer single with a bat mix.

230
00:13:23.010 --> 00:13:25.620
They placed the best on another single modern Don Juan,

231
00:13:25.650 --> 00:13:29.970
which they sent to fail by releasing on Christmas Eve a month later on January

232
00:13:29.971 --> 00:13:31.590
the 26th, 1956,

233
00:13:31.591 --> 00:13:35.280
Decker announced a buddy that the one year contract had expired and they had no

234
00:13:35.730 --> 00:13:36.480
intention to renew it.

235
00:13:36.480 --> 00:13:39.270
That didn't mean they were done with buddy Holly completely though.

236
00:13:39.330 --> 00:13:43.110
The crafty businessmen at Decca would still retain rights to his songs for five

237
00:13:43.111 --> 00:13:44.730
years after this disappointment,

238
00:13:44.850 --> 00:13:48.240
the bands melted away only Jerry stuck by his buddy,

239
00:13:48.510 --> 00:13:52.080
the two down to Clovis for another recording session. And this time manager,

240
00:13:52.081 --> 00:13:54.120
Norman petty took notice of that talent.

241
00:13:54.300 --> 00:13:57.720
Here was the deal buddy and Jerry would return in February to record.

242
00:13:57.721 --> 00:14:01.740
Another version of that will be the day and petty would use his cloud as a

243
00:14:01.741 --> 00:14:05.970
recording artist to have local DJs spin in the single and exchange buddy would

244
00:14:05.971 --> 00:14:09.270
list Patty as a coauthor seating, 50% of royalties.

245
00:14:09.360 --> 00:14:12.000
There was another snag to fix due to the deck of contracts.

246
00:14:12.030 --> 00:14:15.870
Buddy was not allowed to recall that single with any other label for a period of

247
00:14:15.871 --> 00:14:18.150
five years. Normally Patty had a brainwave though,

248
00:14:18.210 --> 00:14:21.960
the single would be issued under the name of a new band with buddy listed as

249
00:14:21.961 --> 00:14:24.690
Charles Houghton, his real first and middle names.

250
00:14:24.720 --> 00:14:26.910
He reckons the DECA lawyers would not notice.

251
00:14:27.000 --> 00:14:30.630
So how are they going to name the bands while buddy was a fan of an RNB band

252
00:14:30.631 --> 00:14:33.030
called the spiders. So he looked for a similar sounding name.

253
00:14:33.240 --> 00:14:34.710
He briefly considered the Beatles,

254
00:14:34.860 --> 00:14:37.170
but he felt that was too silly for a band name.

255
00:14:38.670 --> 00:14:41.060
<v 2>You settled on the crickets. This whole kerfuffle is.</v>

256
00:14:41.130 --> 00:14:45.090
<v 0>The reason why the same musicians over the same period issued songs under the</v>

257
00:14:45.091 --> 00:14:46.290
names buddy Holly,

258
00:14:46.291 --> 00:14:50.010
or the crickets and played live as buddy Holly and the crickets.

259
00:14:50.160 --> 00:14:52.640
Now Norman had to find a label depressant distribute.

260
00:14:52.641 --> 00:14:56.300
The single it found a deal with a small shop called Brunswick records,

261
00:14:56.301 --> 00:14:58.430
which was the subsidiary of coral records,

262
00:14:58.431 --> 00:15:03.260
which was a division of DECA buddy had to lay low and not sign anything

263
00:15:03.261 --> 00:15:07.130
less. The lawyers at DECA discovered that deception in March of 1957,

264
00:15:07.370 --> 00:15:11.390
wholly recorded a new ballad in Clovis called words of love, worth noting here.

265
00:15:11.391 --> 00:15:12.740
For two reasons here,

266
00:15:13.010 --> 00:15:16.640
buddy recorded both the rhythm and lead guitar parts by himself using the

267
00:15:16.641 --> 00:15:18.920
technique of overdubbing. Now commonplace.

268
00:15:18.921 --> 00:15:22.400
The technique had been pioneered by guitarist, Lez, Paul and his wife,

269
00:15:22.401 --> 00:15:23.091
Mary Ford,

270
00:15:23.091 --> 00:15:26.360
but buddy used it for the first time in rock and roll making it its own.

271
00:15:26.450 --> 00:15:29.990
The other reason is that the tune attracted the attention of the executives at

272
00:15:30.560 --> 00:15:34.220
Coralee found out that Charles Hodson. If the crickets was in fact, buddy Holly,

273
00:15:34.430 --> 00:15:36.650
this led to a confrontation with a deck of lawyers,

274
00:15:36.651 --> 00:15:39.620
but Patty was able to negotiate a satisfactory conclusion,

275
00:15:40.220 --> 00:15:41.690
shad royalty royalties on the sales.

276
00:15:41.810 --> 00:15:45.140
If the new version of that will be the date, this new version by the way,

277
00:15:45.141 --> 00:15:47.390
had already been released without buddy even knowing.

278
00:15:47.391 --> 00:15:51.080
And it was so many worming its way into the ears and hearts of American team.

279
00:15:51.730 --> 00:15:52.563
<v 3>Nature's</v>

280
00:15:57.820 --> 00:15:57.880
[inaudible].

281
00:15:57.880 --> 00:16:00.370
<v 0>But he still saw very little return for his efforts,</v>

282
00:16:00.400 --> 00:16:02.260
but he was on a songwriting role.

283
00:16:02.261 --> 00:16:06.490
So he booked more time with Norman in the summer of 1957, the crickets recorded.

284
00:16:06.580 --> 00:16:09.340
I'm going to love you too, buddy. Brought another composition,

285
00:16:09.370 --> 00:16:13.990
a slow piece with a Latin beat called Cindy Lou Jerry improved it by adding a

286
00:16:13.991 --> 00:16:17.980
faster rolling Timbo on his drums known as the paradiddles. It sounded great,

287
00:16:17.981 --> 00:16:19.270
but it was hard to maintain the beats.

288
00:16:19.271 --> 00:16:22.870
And Jerry was flagging in between takes buddy though knew how to motivate his

289
00:16:22.871 --> 00:16:25.360
friends. If he managed to record the track in one go,

290
00:16:25.510 --> 00:16:28.510
it would give him the songwriting credits as an added incentive.

291
00:16:28.511 --> 00:16:31.660
He would rename the song after Jerry's off and on girlfriends.

292
00:16:31.720 --> 00:16:35.500
Jerry's girlfriend was called Peggy Sue Garen and unsuspecting teenager.

293
00:16:35.620 --> 00:16:39.160
He ultimately lends a name to one of buddy's most immortal songs.

294
00:16:39.370 --> 00:16:42.790
Now often the DECA disappointments buddy and the crickets were on an upward

295
00:16:42.791 --> 00:16:45.970
trajectory. That will be the day he had sold more than 50,000 copies.

296
00:16:46.090 --> 00:16:49.000
And the guys had been booked for a tour on the East coast.

297
00:16:49.030 --> 00:16:52.870
This was actually the result of a fudge up the tall promoters were after an

298
00:16:53.320 --> 00:16:56.080
all-black vocal group called the crickets. Following the mix up.

299
00:16:56.110 --> 00:17:00.460
They were stuck with four white boys from Texas opening for R and B acts all

300
00:17:00.461 --> 00:17:04.450
black venues in New York, DC and Baltimore in New York buddy.

301
00:17:04.451 --> 00:17:08.440
And his pals had to play three nights after being booed off stage for the first

302
00:17:08.441 --> 00:17:10.150
two buddy wanted to change it up.

303
00:17:10.180 --> 00:17:14.500
He opens the third gig with a barnstorming rendition of Bo Diddley by blues,

304
00:17:14.501 --> 00:17:16.090
guitarist boat, Italy.

305
00:17:16.300 --> 00:17:20.200
The audience went wild from then on the crickets would have little difficulty

306
00:17:20.320 --> 00:17:22.330
and appealing to both black and white audiences.

307
00:17:22.600 --> 00:17:26.080
The next big tour was the biggest show of stars of 1957.

308
00:17:26.081 --> 00:17:30.550
A sort of traveling suck as a popular artists in the soul R and B and early rock

309
00:17:30.551 --> 00:17:31.384
and roll genres.

310
00:17:31.800 --> 00:17:34.600
Buddy had the opportunity to rub elbows with people like Paul anger.

311
00:17:34.630 --> 00:17:38.290
The drift is the Everly brothers and some dude called Chuck Berry.

312
00:17:38.440 --> 00:17:42.430
On October the 18th, the sheriff stars had reached Sacramento where Peggy Sue,

313
00:17:42.490 --> 00:17:44.230
the girl was now living with a mother.

314
00:17:44.380 --> 00:17:47.920
Jerry invited Peggy to the concert and buddy decided to close the show with a

315
00:17:47.921 --> 00:17:50.640
surprise. He announced they were going to play a new song,

316
00:17:50.641 --> 00:17:54.870
dedicated to a special person in the audience. He then launched into Peggy Sue,

317
00:17:55.050 --> 00:17:56.430
the song backstage,

318
00:17:56.460 --> 00:17:59.850
Jerry and Peggy got back together for good while buddy taunted her.

319
00:17:59.970 --> 00:18:02.940
Aren't you glad your mother named you? After my new hit song,

320
00:18:03.240 --> 00:18:07.260
he was not exaggerating. It was a hit song selling more than a million copies,

321
00:18:07.410 --> 00:18:10.170
but he was barely 21. And at the peak of his fame,

322
00:18:10.410 --> 00:18:14.940
but some bad news was right around the corner. Ready to hit like a one,

323
00:18:14.941 --> 00:18:19.470
two from Floyd Patterson in December buddy on the crickets were back in Lubbock

324
00:18:19.471 --> 00:18:22.620
for some well-deserved rest. After months of touring, the first job,

325
00:18:22.700 --> 00:18:23.700
it was the news that echo,

326
00:18:23.880 --> 00:18:27.150
but he's long distance girlfriend was in love with somebody else and was about

327
00:18:27.151 --> 00:18:29.550
to marry him. Not the buddy had been saintly.

328
00:18:29.640 --> 00:18:32.730
You having had a short relationship with an older married woman along with an

329
00:18:32.731 --> 00:18:35.250
alleged threesome, with little Richard and his girlfriend,

330
00:18:35.370 --> 00:18:39.150
the right hook followed echo was the news that buddies back in guitarist,

331
00:18:39.170 --> 00:18:40.950
Nick Sullivan was quitting. The bands.

332
00:18:41.220 --> 00:18:44.190
He was exhausted from touring and he couldn't stand. Jerry.

333
00:18:44.310 --> 00:18:47.010
When Sullivan went to Norman Patty to cash in his royalties,

334
00:18:47.011 --> 00:18:50.820
the final Epcot was delivered. It turned out that Patty had been mismanaging.

335
00:18:50.821 --> 00:18:51.720
The band's funds.

336
00:18:51.750 --> 00:18:55.770
Norman was already cashing in 50% of the crickets royalties as coauthor.

337
00:18:55.860 --> 00:18:56.730
In addition to that,

338
00:18:56.731 --> 00:19:00.240
he had collected all of the royalties into a joint accounts from which he

339
00:19:00.270 --> 00:19:04.110
liberally dipped in for his own personal expenses. The, in the crickets,

340
00:19:04.111 --> 00:19:08.160
it also asked that 40% of their royalty shares be diverted to their respective

341
00:19:08.190 --> 00:19:12.480
churches. Something the religious boys from Lubbock cared deeply about. Well,

342
00:19:13.020 --> 00:19:14.190
Patsy, he hadn't done any of that.

343
00:19:14.280 --> 00:19:16.920
It's an all-clear why buddy did not fire him then and there,

344
00:19:16.921 --> 00:19:20.220
but he surely understood that this man was not to be trusted.

345
00:19:20.340 --> 00:19:24.930
The rift widened in early 1958 during a tour of Hawaii and Australia with Jerry

346
00:19:24.930 --> 00:19:28.800
Lee Lewis and Paul Lanka tour managers insisted that the crickets accepted a

347
00:19:28.950 --> 00:19:32.250
less prestigious building as opening act while Patty was opposed.

348
00:19:32.670 --> 00:19:36.420
Holly overruled him confidence that his band would impress audiences. Anyhow,

349
00:19:36.450 --> 00:19:39.450
he agreed to that demands in exchange for a higher fee.

350
00:19:39.540 --> 00:19:42.480
When Jerry announced his intentions to marry Peggy Sue Norman,

351
00:19:42.810 --> 00:19:46.110
PESI tried to reassert his leadership by proposing to father drummer.

352
00:19:46.111 --> 00:19:50.370
According to him, married popstar would lose its appeal to female fans,

353
00:19:50.610 --> 00:19:52.890
but he retorted that as Patty was already married,

354
00:19:52.950 --> 00:19:56.250
maybe they should fire him instead, but they didn't. Instead.

355
00:19:56.251 --> 00:20:00.180
Norman Patty was still with the crickets. When on the 27th of February, 1958,

356
00:20:00.330 --> 00:20:01.260
they flew to London.

357
00:20:01.500 --> 00:20:05.610
They were about to embark on one of the most influential tours in popular music,

358
00:20:06.120 --> 00:20:07.980
buzzing in the crickets, swept to London off its feet,

359
00:20:07.990 --> 00:20:10.470
influencing up and coming artists like the Beatles,

360
00:20:10.680 --> 00:20:12.660
Eric Clapton and the rolling stones.

361
00:20:12.690 --> 00:20:17.070
Legendary acts from the 1960s covered many of buddy Holly songs and borrowed

362
00:20:17.071 --> 00:20:19.620
much of his bands, mannerisms and songwriting style.

363
00:20:19.680 --> 00:20:21.180
According to author John Gribbon,

364
00:20:21.210 --> 00:20:26.130
the British invasion of the 1960s had actually started in 1958 with this

365
00:20:26.730 --> 00:20:28.110
Texan kid invading London

366
00:20:34.880 --> 00:20:38.810
Professional life sorted out buddy was about to sort out his love life.

367
00:20:38.900 --> 00:20:42.860
In June of 1958, Holly was in New York visiting his music publisher.

368
00:20:43.100 --> 00:20:44.630
As soon as he stepped into the office,

369
00:20:45.080 --> 00:20:47.030
lightening struck him not a new musical idea.

370
00:20:47.200 --> 00:20:52.090
The eyes of the company's ravishing, secretary Maria, Elena Santiago, Maria,

371
00:20:52.091 --> 00:20:54.100
Elena was originally from Puerto Rico,

372
00:20:54.101 --> 00:20:57.640
but had moved to New York to live with her aunt privy Garcia buddy asked around

373
00:20:57.641 --> 00:21:01.180
immediately the 25 year old Maria Elena was taken aback.

374
00:21:01.210 --> 00:21:04.420
She had been out on a date. Alex pre-vis had worn down,

375
00:21:04.440 --> 00:21:07.210
not to mingle with musicians. Musicians are all crazy.

376
00:21:07.211 --> 00:21:08.950
And I don't want you to get involved with that,

377
00:21:09.210 --> 00:21:11.920
but buddy's John must have been irresistible and she accepted.

378
00:21:12.250 --> 00:21:14.920
He came to pick her up with a limousine and over dinner.

379
00:21:15.220 --> 00:21:16.990
He proposed to her as usual,

380
00:21:17.020 --> 00:21:20.410
Holly moved fast and the week later he flew his parents to New York so they

381
00:21:20.411 --> 00:21:23.290
could meet up two weeks later, they got married in Lubbock,

382
00:21:23.470 --> 00:21:27.010
whatever plans they had to live in Texas must have been shattered early on

383
00:21:27.190 --> 00:21:30.040
Lubbock was strictly segregated and deeply prejudiced,

384
00:21:30.100 --> 00:21:33.720
not only against Africans Americans, but also against Latin Americans.

385
00:21:33.930 --> 00:21:37.560
On one night out, I went for an ice cream. When Maria made her order,

386
00:21:37.860 --> 00:21:41.100
the waitress completely ignored her Maria Elena insisted.

387
00:21:41.101 --> 00:21:42.330
They moved back to the mall.

388
00:21:43.170 --> 00:21:46.860
Multicultural New York and buddy was happy to comply during the following six

389
00:21:46.861 --> 00:21:50.100
months, buddy thrived in the lively environment of Greenwich village.

390
00:21:50.430 --> 00:21:53.370
It found a passion for jazz flamenco and movie scores.

391
00:21:53.550 --> 00:21:55.980
The attended poetry readings at the local coffee houses.

392
00:21:56.130 --> 00:22:00.210
He planned to record music with Ray Charles and Mahalia Jackson even considered

393
00:22:00.211 --> 00:22:02.040
becoming an AXA, but most of all,

394
00:22:02.280 --> 00:22:05.490
but he felt he had to give something back to the music industry that had given

395
00:22:05.491 --> 00:22:07.260
him both a career and a passionate.

396
00:22:07.350 --> 00:22:11.610
One of the first things he helped produce was Richie valence of LA Bamba fame,

397
00:22:11.790 --> 00:22:15.000
of course, to realize all these projects, but he needed cash.

398
00:22:15.030 --> 00:22:17.340
But despite his hit singles, he was broke.

399
00:22:17.400 --> 00:22:21.900
All Israeli money was tied up in Norman Petty's bank accounts. And late October,

400
00:22:21.901 --> 00:22:25.290
1958, buddy and Maria went to Clovis to confront petty.

401
00:22:25.530 --> 00:22:29.010
He had convinced Jerry and his basis, Joe Malden to do it the same.

402
00:22:29.011 --> 00:22:32.580
But when they got to the studio, they found out that petty had talked.

403
00:22:32.581 --> 00:22:35.220
The boys into staying with him. Buddy was livid.

404
00:22:35.280 --> 00:22:39.150
He wants it batching and take his money back. According to Maria Norman replied,

405
00:22:39.390 --> 00:22:44.310
I'd rather see you starve to death Fest. Buddy broke free of PESI that day,

406
00:22:44.340 --> 00:22:48.630
but he had also lost his beloved crickets on the way back. He broke down crying,

407
00:22:48.720 --> 00:22:53.280
buddy resumed life without Patty and without the crickets in the winter of 1959,

408
00:22:53.310 --> 00:22:56.640
he had been booked to play on a tour called the winter dance party alongside his

409
00:22:56.641 --> 00:23:00.480
young protege Richie valence and JP, the big Butler Richardson.

410
00:23:00.570 --> 00:23:04.530
The musicians had started in Milwaukee and traveled to small cities in Minnesota

411
00:23:04.531 --> 00:23:08.490
and Iowa trudging along on heated ramshackle buses and some freezing

412
00:23:08.491 --> 00:23:11.310
temperatures. By the time the group reached clear Lake Iowa,

413
00:23:11.640 --> 00:23:12.630
Holly couldn't take it anymore,

414
00:23:12.870 --> 00:23:15.810
but he booked a four seat aircraft to fly to Fargo, North Dakota,

415
00:23:16.350 --> 00:23:20.040
that he planned to finally do his laundry and enjoy some rest before the next

416
00:23:20.041 --> 00:23:22.860
concert in Morehead, Minnesota buddies, new basis,

417
00:23:22.890 --> 00:23:25.440
Waylon Jennings was supposed to fly with them and valence,

418
00:23:25.470 --> 00:23:27.870
but at the last minute he gave up his seat,

419
00:23:27.900 --> 00:23:31.800
the big bopper who was ill and couldn't stand another day of bus travel pilot.

420
00:23:31.801 --> 00:23:35.490
Roger Peterson took off at 55 minutes past midnight. On the 3rd of February,

421
00:23:35.700 --> 00:23:39.450
it was nothing more than a routine flight to deliver some musicians to the next

422
00:23:39.451 --> 00:23:42.780
gig, but it wasn't a routine flight. After any five minutes,

423
00:23:42.781 --> 00:23:45.920
witnesses reported seeing the tail light of the aircraft plummet toward the

424
00:23:45.921 --> 00:23:50.600
grounds. The wreckage was found in an open farm field at 9:35 AM that morning,

425
00:23:50.660 --> 00:23:54.560
all three passengers and the pilot had died. According to an early reports,

426
00:23:54.561 --> 00:23:58.790
the crash was caused by poor weather SCAs visibility and the inability of the

427
00:23:58.791 --> 00:24:00.410
pilot to fly on instruments alone.

428
00:24:00.590 --> 00:24:04.400
Alaysia report claims that the accident was caused by an unbalanced load issues

429
00:24:04.401 --> 00:24:07.700
with the rudder panels and ice on the carburetor, whatever the case,

430
00:24:07.730 --> 00:24:11.930
the life of buddy Holly had been cut short far too soon upon hearing the news,

431
00:24:11.931 --> 00:24:15.680
Maria Elena suffered a miscarriage and was in such shock that she couldn't even

432
00:24:15.681 --> 00:24:17.360
attend the funeral. Buddy's older brother.

433
00:24:17.361 --> 00:24:20.660
Larry stopped listening to music all together for years.

434
00:24:20.870 --> 00:24:23.480
And the words of the song, American pie by Don McLean,

435
00:24:23.810 --> 00:24:27.170
it was the day the music died. Was this an exaggerated claim?

436
00:24:27.650 --> 00:24:30.890
All for John Gribbin is among those who consider buddy Holly as possibly the

437
00:24:30.891 --> 00:24:34.790
most influential artist of the early rock and roll era. Unlike Elvis,

438
00:24:34.850 --> 00:24:37.400
he wrote his own songs. Unlike other rock and rollers,

439
00:24:37.401 --> 00:24:41.270
he did not rely almost exclusively on the classic three-quarters structure,

440
00:24:41.300 --> 00:24:44.090
borrowed from 12 bar blues. He was an innovator,

441
00:24:44.210 --> 00:24:47.360
both in songwriting and in the use of new recording techniques.

442
00:24:47.540 --> 00:24:50.960
Keith Richards also observed that buddy Holly and the crickets were the world's

443
00:24:50.961 --> 00:24:54.200
first self-contained rock and roll bands, writing their own songs,

444
00:24:54.350 --> 00:24:55.610
performing their own music,

445
00:24:55.760 --> 00:24:59.810
seeking to gain creative control from produces and recording seamlessly.

446
00:24:59.990 --> 00:25:04.160
But lastly, buddy appeared to be, and it's probably really was a nice guy.

447
00:25:04.280 --> 00:25:07.760
Somebody who looks like your neighbor, your friends like you.

448
00:25:08.180 --> 00:25:12.650
And yet he was also a nice guy who could crank out killer tunes and make it all

449
00:25:12.651 --> 00:25:13.484
look so easy.

450
00:25:13.580 --> 00:25:17.330
Perhaps this quality more than Elvis's gyrations and more than Chuck Berry's

451
00:25:17.331 --> 00:25:21.830
fretboard acrobatics is what could inspire teens across the world to grab a

452
00:25:21.831 --> 00:25:26.000
guitar and jump on stage. So I already have you found that video. Interesting.
