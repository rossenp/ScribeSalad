5
00:00:19.940 --> 00:00:24.320
He was a man born into the world to shake the nations. The scourge of all lands,

6
00:00:24.530 --> 00:00:25.490
who in some way,

7
00:00:25.491 --> 00:00:30.080
terrified all mankind by the dreadful rumors noised abroad

8
00:00:30.290 --> 00:00:33.950
concerning him. That's is a contemporary description of a tiller.

9
00:00:33.951 --> 00:00:37.910
The man who transforms the Huns from a gathering of nomadic tribes into an

10
00:00:37.911 --> 00:00:42.200
empire that dominated the world with an unsurpassed speed and fierceness.

11
00:00:42.290 --> 00:00:46.040
They say that the flame, which burns twice as bright burns, half as long,

12
00:00:46.041 --> 00:00:49.250
and this is an apt metaphor for the Hanuk empire.

13
00:00:49.280 --> 00:00:53.390
They seemingly appeared out of nowhere and almost immediately it became a force

14
00:00:53.391 --> 00:00:56.990
to be reckoned with defeating all the nations that stood in their way.

15
00:00:57.050 --> 00:01:01.790
Even the Roman empire learns to fear artilleryman the cold flagellum

16
00:01:01.791 --> 00:01:04.280
day or of a scourge of God,

17
00:01:04.430 --> 00:01:08.660
but then Siller died and the Hunter can buy collapsed just as fast as it had

18
00:01:08.661 --> 00:01:10.160
sprung to life, even.

19
00:01:10.160 --> 00:01:14.810
So their impact was still felt as the Hanuk invasions caused a period of great

20
00:01:14.811 --> 00:01:19.790
migrations where Germanic tribes headed out West to escape the wrath of

21
00:01:19.791 --> 00:01:23.030
the Huns, the golfs, the vandals, the Lombards, the Franks,

22
00:01:23.031 --> 00:01:27.740
the Anglo Saxons them and many more packed up and settled new

23
00:01:27.741 --> 00:01:31.580
lands where their descendants can still be found today. But of course,

24
00:01:31.610 --> 00:01:36.080
most of these lands already belongs to the Romans who would not give them up

25
00:01:36.140 --> 00:01:37.070
without a fight.

26
00:01:37.160 --> 00:01:40.910
The Wars between these two sides directly led to the fall of the Western Roman

27
00:01:40.911 --> 00:01:41.600
empire.

28
00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:45.200
It becomes evidence that the Hanukkah invasions under a tiller changed the

29
00:01:45.201 --> 00:01:46.730
landscape of the worlds.

30
00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:48.433
<v 1>Forever.</v>

31
00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:56.060
<v 0>But tell us the year of birth is one big question.</v>

32
00:01:56.061 --> 00:01:59.960
Mark dates have been suggested that range from the late fourth century to the

33
00:02:00.140 --> 00:02:03.650
early fifth century, Ady based on the events in his life.

34
00:02:03.770 --> 00:02:08.030
Some scholars believed that 395 AED is the most probable birth. Yeah.

35
00:02:08.040 --> 00:02:11.000
While others think the 406 80 is more likely.

36
00:02:11.210 --> 00:02:13.280
So it could have been one or the other,

37
00:02:13.610 --> 00:02:17.390
or it could have just been something in between. We just don't know the same.

38
00:02:18.260 --> 00:02:20.540
Uncertainty extends to a Telus people, the Huns,

39
00:02:20.690 --> 00:02:22.400
they were a warrior nomadic nation.

40
00:02:22.420 --> 00:02:26.330
So they didn't really leave behind texts or monuments or cities,

41
00:02:26.331 --> 00:02:30.140
which we could study to understand that culture and the Western historical

42
00:02:30.141 --> 00:02:30.621
record,

43
00:02:30.621 --> 00:02:34.040
they simply appeared toward the end of the fourth century when they decided to

44
00:02:34.041 --> 00:02:37.460
cross the vulgar river and expand into Eastern and central Europe,

45
00:02:37.670 --> 00:02:41.420
historians have debated their origin and even the language that they spoke,

46
00:02:41.450 --> 00:02:44.480
but they don't know anything with absolute certainty.

47
00:02:44.570 --> 00:02:48.110
One popular idea suggests some kind of link with an early animatic people

48
00:02:48.111 --> 00:02:52.100
originating in Mongolia and attested in ancient Chinese sources.

49
00:02:52.280 --> 00:02:56.240
The Zhang knew they had lived in the region as early as the third century BC and

50
00:02:56.241 --> 00:03:00.730
had gone to war against the Chinese hand dynasty for 200 years before

51
00:03:00.880 --> 00:03:03.040
eventually suffering a decisive defeat.

52
00:03:03.190 --> 00:03:05.380
Some argue that the Shaun knew where in fact,

53
00:03:05.410 --> 00:03:09.790
the hums while others believes there was at least some continuity between the

54
00:03:09.791 --> 00:03:14.440
tribes. But again, always stress that this is just speculation.

55
00:03:14.500 --> 00:03:18.640
When it comes to a tiller himself, we find a scarcity of reliable sources.

56
00:03:18.820 --> 00:03:21.700
One major contribution was PRISCUS of Pentium,

57
00:03:21.701 --> 00:03:26.350
a Roman diplomat and historian who was not only alive during the hums rain,

58
00:03:26.351 --> 00:03:29.920
but it's actually met a tiller as part of a diplomatic mission to his court.

59
00:03:30.760 --> 00:03:33.310
Presbycusis work did not survive in its entirety,

60
00:03:33.311 --> 00:03:38.200
but it was quoted by later historians such as Jordanians and CALSEIA Doris.

61
00:03:38.320 --> 00:03:42.100
Therefore we do have fragments of it included in other texts that did survive.

62
00:03:42.490 --> 00:03:45.700
One juicy beds provided by PRISCUS is a description of a tiller.

63
00:03:46.150 --> 00:03:50.750
He was haughty in his walk, rolling his eyes, his, uh, and the, the, so the,

64
00:03:50.751 --> 00:03:54.100
the power of his proud spirits appears in the movement of his body.

65
00:03:54.250 --> 00:03:58.690
He was indeed a lover of war yet restrained in action, mighty in council,

66
00:03:58.750 --> 00:04:02.890
gracious to supplicants and lenient to those who once received into his

67
00:04:02.891 --> 00:04:07.270
protection. He is short of stature with a broad chest and a large head.

68
00:04:07.420 --> 00:04:10.540
His eyes were small, his beard thin and sprinkled with gray.

69
00:04:10.541 --> 00:04:14.860
And he had a flat nose and a swarthy complexion showing the evidences of his

70
00:04:14.861 --> 00:04:15.490
origin.

71
00:04:15.490 --> 00:04:19.480
And though his temper was such that he always had great self-confidence yet his

72
00:04:19.481 --> 00:04:22.840
assurance was increased by finding the sword of Mars,

73
00:04:22.870 --> 00:04:25.360
always esteemed sacred among the Kings of the time.

74
00:04:25.380 --> 00:04:26.213
<v 1>Yes.</v>

75
00:04:32.250 --> 00:04:35.760
<v 0>And mom's first came to Europe. They were not unified as a single force.</v>

76
00:04:35.790 --> 00:04:40.020
They were still made up of loosely affiliated clans that each has their own

77
00:04:40.021 --> 00:04:42.000
King, their first major conquest,

78
00:04:42.120 --> 00:04:46.410
where the Allan so well followed by plenty of other small and obscure tribes

79
00:04:46.411 --> 00:04:48.270
that had the misfortune of being in the weight.

80
00:04:48.360 --> 00:04:50.460
As the Huns made advances into Europe,

81
00:04:50.461 --> 00:04:55.290
they began encountering Gothic nations like the thingy and GRU sung guy.

82
00:04:55.410 --> 00:04:59.010
These two proved no match for the invading hordes and they were forced to

83
00:04:59.011 --> 00:05:00.480
retreat further to the West.

84
00:05:00.660 --> 00:05:05.550
It was only a matter of time before they eventually ran into Roman territory.

85
00:05:05.820 --> 00:05:09.120
I'm speaking of the Romans, we should make a quick mention of their situation.

86
00:05:09.270 --> 00:05:12.000
By this point, the power of the Roman empire was fading.

87
00:05:12.090 --> 00:05:15.660
It was no longer the juggernaut that it used to be holding dominion over most of

88
00:05:15.661 --> 00:05:17.730
Europe and parts of Asia and Africa.

89
00:05:17.820 --> 00:05:21.480
It had unofficially been divided into the Western and Eastern Roman empire,

90
00:05:21.510 --> 00:05:25.410
meaning that's. It had two political administrations, two emperors,

91
00:05:25.411 --> 00:05:30.030
and two capitals. The Eastern Roman also known as the Byzantine empire,

92
00:05:30.031 --> 00:05:33.990
which was headquartered at Constantinople while the Western Roman empire no

93
00:05:33.991 --> 00:05:38.520
longer used Rome as its seat of power, but rather media Lanham,

94
00:05:38.580 --> 00:05:39.630
AKA Milan.

95
00:05:39.810 --> 00:05:43.290
It should be pointed out that this division between Eastern West was done

96
00:05:43.291 --> 00:05:47.520
retroactively by modern scholars to create a more evident distinction between

97
00:05:47.521 --> 00:05:48.840
the two political entities.

98
00:05:48.990 --> 00:05:52.680
Romans from that time would have still considered themselves simply citizens of

99
00:05:52.681 --> 00:05:56.310
a single empire. The division was also done with the benefit of hindsight.

100
00:05:56.311 --> 00:06:00.410
Since historians knew that the Western Roman empire would collapse completely in

101
00:06:00.411 --> 00:06:02.690
the late fifth century while the Byzantine embalm,

102
00:06:02.720 --> 00:06:05.150
which is another time applied retroactively, by the way,

103
00:06:05.270 --> 00:06:07.940
would last for another thousand years. Anyway,

104
00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:12.920
the Gulf sought refuge in Roman lands a first Eastern Roman emperor valence

105
00:06:12.950 --> 00:06:16.850
gave them permission to settle, probably looking at them as a cheap Alami.

106
00:06:16.940 --> 00:06:17.480
However,

107
00:06:17.480 --> 00:06:20.930
the lands they were given was not sufficient to hold all the people fleeing the

108
00:06:20.931 --> 00:06:23.690
Huns food shortages, let derives and revolts,

109
00:06:23.691 --> 00:06:27.650
which in 376 blossomed into a fully fledged war.

110
00:06:27.740 --> 00:06:31.580
This was one of many such conflicts between the goths and the Raymonds.

111
00:06:31.760 --> 00:06:35.120
Of course, while all this was going on, the Huns made their own incursions.

112
00:06:35.150 --> 00:06:38.960
They attacked the parts of the Eastern Roman empire that corresponded to Western

113
00:06:38.961 --> 00:06:41.450
Asia, such as Kapha, dosha, and Syria.

114
00:06:41.540 --> 00:06:45.770
They probably also tried their luck against the Sasanian or Neo Persian empire,

115
00:06:45.771 --> 00:06:50.180
but encountered a red defeat and driven back into Europe. At times,

116
00:06:50.240 --> 00:06:53.630
the hums were employed as mercenaries by the Romans to fight the goths.

117
00:06:53.660 --> 00:06:55.760
One notable example was in 406,

118
00:06:55.761 --> 00:06:59.960
a D when King [inaudible] led an army of Ostrogoths to invade Italy,

119
00:07:00.140 --> 00:07:04.190
the Romans use tons Allen's and golfs as mercenaries to help them win the war

120
00:07:04.310 --> 00:07:07.550
over the following decades, the Romans and the Huns had an uneasy Alliance,

121
00:07:07.551 --> 00:07:11.030
although both sides, occasionally brokers and attacks one another,

122
00:07:11.090 --> 00:07:12.650
something more important happened though,

123
00:07:12.830 --> 00:07:17.660
the Hulus became a United force under a man named Ruga or sometimes regalia.

124
00:07:17.750 --> 00:07:21.830
He either ruled alone a Supreme King aided by his brother, Octa,

125
00:07:21.980 --> 00:07:25.250
or they were code rulers and each brother held dominion over half of that

126
00:07:25.251 --> 00:07:29.720
territory either way. Oxon was the first to die around 438 D.

127
00:07:29.721 --> 00:07:31.460
So at least for a while,

128
00:07:31.490 --> 00:07:35.690
Ruger was the sole ruler of the Huns Briga has another brother.

129
00:07:35.691 --> 00:07:40.340
And his name was Mungiu because he had two sons, beta and Attila.

130
00:07:40.400 --> 00:07:44.360
We're not sure if we got lacked any sons visit zone or how the Ascension process

131
00:07:44.361 --> 00:07:47.060
works, but when we're in good died in 434,

132
00:07:47.061 --> 00:07:50.420
a D his two nephews became the new rulers of the Huns.

133
00:07:50.510 --> 00:07:53.440
And if you are going to become the ruler of your own, well,

134
00:07:53.441 --> 00:07:58.120
let me tell you about today's sponsor war thunder or thunder is a realistic free

135
00:07:58.121 --> 00:08:00.160
to play military vehicle combat game.

136
00:08:00.340 --> 00:08:03.430
It's available on PC PS4 and Xbox one,

137
00:08:03.431 --> 00:08:08.050
but you only need one of those to play. There's also no need to purchase year,

just download and get started in this game.

139
00:08:10.571 --> 00:08:14.350
There are over 1,500 historically accurately.

140
00:08:14.770 --> 00:08:19.390
It's all the way from the 1920s to the 1990s. And they're all carefully built,

141
00:08:19.540 --> 00:08:20.710
incredibly detailed,

142
00:08:20.740 --> 00:08:24.250
and you can see that all the physics in the game has really been sweated over.

143
00:08:24.251 --> 00:08:27.850
It's really very, very good plus super immersive sound.

144
00:08:28.000 --> 00:08:30.940
So that's also cool play with a good pair of headphones. And look,

you can go for the more challenging tactical stuff, or if you're hardcore,

148

there's always simulator, but yeah,

149
00:08:44.320 --> 00:08:47.890
I've never played that because I don't like getting my whipped over and over

150
00:08:47.891 --> 00:08:48.400

<v 1>Bleeding.</v>

156
00:09:14.020 --> 00:09:16.370
<v 0>And the teller. We're now in charge of the lens of the hums,</v>

157
00:09:16.371 --> 00:09:19.760
which were steadily growing to become quite the empire. In fact,

158
00:09:19.761 --> 00:09:23.210
by the time until it died, the Hanuk empire rivaled, the Roman one in size,

159
00:09:23.450 --> 00:09:26.000
as far as power dynamics between him and his brother.

160
00:09:26.270 --> 00:09:30.110
We're not entirely sure it is possible that they had an arrangement similar to

161
00:09:30.260 --> 00:09:34.550
Ruger and are where each sibling held dominion over half the empire.

162
00:09:34.610 --> 00:09:38.120
But it is also possible that the Huns regarded only one of them was their

163
00:09:38.121 --> 00:09:40.790
Supreme, chief Tang, whatever the relationship was.

164
00:09:40.820 --> 00:09:45.440
It continued for 11 years until bleed his death around 445 eight deep

165
00:09:45.650 --> 00:09:50.360
those circumstances. It won't surprise you to discover also somewhat uncertain.

166
00:09:50.361 --> 00:09:54.650
Although the classic sources claim that Attila killed his brother to assume sole

167
00:09:54.651 --> 00:09:57.230
control of the hunts we turned to PRISCUS again,

168
00:09:57.380 --> 00:10:01.250
who Rose to those bleeder King of the Huns was assassinated as a result of the

169
00:10:01.251 --> 00:10:02.660
plots of his brother, a tiller,

170
00:10:02.720 --> 00:10:05.330
but we are getting ahead of ourselves just a bit.

171
00:10:05.360 --> 00:10:08.540
And let's start with the beginning of a Tiller's rain.

172
00:10:08.570 --> 00:10:12.530
The first issue that needed to be dealt with where the Romans at the time,

173
00:10:12.531 --> 00:10:15.320
Rome was relatively neutral with the hands under Ruger,

174
00:10:15.350 --> 00:10:19.310
but they had to consider that his nephews might have other ideas.

175
00:10:19.490 --> 00:10:22.820
The Romans were already paying the hunters tribute, and as it turns out,

176
00:10:22.850 --> 00:10:27.350
they were willing to pay quite a bit more in exchange for peace in 435,

177
00:10:27.351 --> 00:10:29.540
the two sides signs, the treaty of Margus,

178
00:10:29.541 --> 00:10:33.410
which was quite favorable to the Huns. The remanent bought would pay.

179
00:10:33.590 --> 00:10:36.260
Then they fixed annual tribute of 700 pounds of gold,

180
00:10:36.261 --> 00:10:40.970
which was double what they were paying before. They also vowed to return on it,

181
00:10:40.971 --> 00:10:44.960
refugees and devoid entering alliances with enemies of the Huns.

182
00:10:45.080 --> 00:10:46.490
This was a pretty sweet deal for,

183
00:10:46.780 --> 00:10:50.000
until it was over the moment he saw no conflict with the Romans. Instead,

184
00:10:50.001 --> 00:10:53.630
he thought he would invade Persia again and try to take down the sustainer and

185
00:10:53.960 --> 00:10:56.900
bar, hoping to succeed where his predecessors had failed.

186
00:10:56.960 --> 00:11:00.200
We don't have solid sources on this part of his reign since the Romans weren't

187
00:11:00.201 --> 00:11:00.651
involved,

188
00:11:00.651 --> 00:11:04.520
but suffice to say that the teller was defeated and forced to retreat back to

189
00:11:04.521 --> 00:11:08.240
Europe, that his first dog, it was good into Hawk King of burgundy.

190
00:11:08.270 --> 00:11:13.100
This King also known as Gunther or Ghana became a character in popular legends

191
00:11:13.101 --> 00:11:17.810
and appears in both the Nordic collection of poems called poetic Edda and the

192
00:11:17.811 --> 00:11:21.980
dramatic song of nibbling, the legendary version of King Goodhart,

193
00:11:22.100 --> 00:11:25.640
who was slain and basle in 437 by Essilor himself,

194
00:11:25.790 --> 00:11:28.100
the historical one it's far less likely.

195
00:11:28.130 --> 00:11:30.760
The Romans were the primary enemies of the begun Indians.

196
00:11:30.800 --> 00:11:35.150
While the hun served as auxiliary mercenaries pad that treaty the begun scions

197
00:11:35.151 --> 00:11:39.320
had crossed into Roman goal and invaded the province of Belgium prenup.

198
00:11:39.350 --> 00:11:42.710
Naturally the Romans fought back and with the help of the Huns defeated that bow

199
00:11:42.711 --> 00:11:44.090
in battle afterwards,

200
00:11:44.091 --> 00:11:47.000
they continued that push and destroyed the kingdom of burgundy.

201
00:11:47.060 --> 00:11:49.750
The man in charge of the army. It was Flavius ATS,

202
00:11:50.060 --> 00:11:51.740
powerful and influential general.

203
00:11:51.750 --> 00:11:54.550
During the last days of the Western Roman empire, because of this,

204
00:11:54.551 --> 00:11:57.280
he was nicknamed the last of the Romans and historian.

205
00:11:57.310 --> 00:12:02.140
Edward Gibbon described him as being universally celebrated as the terror of the

206
00:12:02.141 --> 00:12:05.230
barbarians and the support of the Republic.

207
00:12:05.290 --> 00:12:09.490
We highlight him now because he will play a more important role a bit later on.

208
00:12:09.940 --> 00:12:10.540
Of course,

209
00:12:10.540 --> 00:12:14.050
everyone knew that the peace treaty between the two powers would not last long

210
00:12:14.230 --> 00:12:15.340
in 441,

211
00:12:15.341 --> 00:12:18.940
the hunters crossed the Danube and attacked the Eastern Roman empire plundering.

212
00:12:18.941 --> 00:12:22.960
The provinces of [inaudible] obviously this maintenance,

213
00:12:22.990 --> 00:12:26.950
the treaty of Maga, but the hungs claimed the Romans actually broke it first,

214
00:12:27.100 --> 00:12:29.890
whether or not this was true or merely an excuse to loot and pillage.

215
00:12:29.891 --> 00:12:34.000
We can't say the timing was somewhat suspicious as the hums designed to do its

216
00:12:34.210 --> 00:12:37.810
act right after emperor. Theodosius the secondary located the garrisons,

217
00:12:37.811 --> 00:12:41.020
defending that border to send them off, to fight the vandals in Africa,

218
00:12:41.050 --> 00:12:44.320
the most likely explanation was simply there's a Telus or a weakness,

219
00:12:44.321 --> 00:12:48.370
and he decided to exploit it. And he was quite successful in that regards,

220
00:12:48.430 --> 00:12:49.121
the hung spillage,

221
00:12:49.121 --> 00:12:53.650
several Roman cities and even raised a few to the grounds like 443 Theodosius

222
00:12:53.651 --> 00:12:56.860
was ready to sign a new treaty, even more beneficial to the Huns.

223
00:12:57.010 --> 00:13:01.240
This satisfied Attila who once again retreated into the heart of his empire so

224
00:13:01.330 --> 00:13:04.540
that some historians argue that someone documented emergency might have

225
00:13:04.541 --> 00:13:06.580
appeared, which required until his attention.

226
00:13:06.730 --> 00:13:10.360
Otherwise he would have had no reason to stop the invasion since his army had

227
00:13:10.450 --> 00:13:11.380
the clear advantage.

228
00:13:11.560 --> 00:13:15.730
This is also the points where bleeder died and the tiller became sole chief tain

229
00:13:15.760 --> 00:13:20.350
of the Huns. We can only speculate over a possible connection between these two,

230
00:13:20.470 --> 00:13:23.380
whether or not the Romans actually paid their attributors on certain.

231
00:13:23.380 --> 00:13:26.140
It is probable that they simply stalled for a few years,

232
00:13:26.141 --> 00:13:29.260
trying to strengthen their defenses for the inevitable time when the Hung's

233
00:13:29.261 --> 00:13:30.094
invaded. Again,

234
00:13:30.310 --> 00:13:34.780
this happens in 447 when Attila led his army into the Eastern Roman empire

235
00:13:34.781 --> 00:13:38.140
again, and ravaged all of the provinces located in the Balkans.

236
00:13:38.170 --> 00:13:41.470
One contemporary souls claims that the hunters captured over a hundred cities

237
00:13:41.650 --> 00:13:45.040
going all the way to the monopoly in Greece, before turning back.

238
00:13:45.250 --> 00:13:48.970
These might've been necessary sacrifices as the Romans concluded that they

239
00:13:48.971 --> 00:13:51.940
needed to gather all of their forces into one powerful army,

240
00:13:52.150 --> 00:13:56.020
instead of letting them die bit by bit trying to defend each city.

241
00:13:56.140 --> 00:13:59.290
The invasion culminated in the battle of Hooters and Deisha.

242
00:13:59.320 --> 00:14:02.680
Repentances near the modern day river VIT in Bulgaria,

243
00:14:02.890 --> 00:14:05.710
the Romans who were led by on a guest cruise,

244
00:14:05.770 --> 00:14:08.320
who found the position of Magister militant,

245
00:14:08.350 --> 00:14:11.770
the highest military rank in the empire at the time on a guest close,

246
00:14:11.800 --> 00:14:14.440
died in battle. And the Romans were defeated by the Huns,

247
00:14:14.441 --> 00:14:17.440
but not without causing some serious casualties.

248
00:14:17.620 --> 00:14:21.640
After this Attila had his eyes set on the grandest prize possible

249
00:14:21.850 --> 00:14:25.600
Constantinople of the capital of the Eastern Roman empire. However,

250
00:14:25.601 --> 00:14:27.280
the famed walls of Constantinople,

251
00:14:27.310 --> 00:14:31.120
plus Roman reinforcements arriving from Asia minor plus all the losses of the

252
00:14:31.330 --> 00:14:35.020
Hunter sustained in the battle of the uterus mentioned that Attila was not

253
00:14:35.021 --> 00:14:39.060
strong enough to take the city. He realized this, so he didn't even try.

254
00:14:39.160 --> 00:14:41.530
Instead. He signed a new peace treaty. This time,

255
00:14:41.531 --> 00:14:46.450
the tribute paid to a tiller was triple what it was first 2,100 pounds of

256
00:14:46.451 --> 00:14:49.270
gold each year. Plus a number of other concessions.

257
00:14:55.630 --> 00:14:59.080
Another conflict ended the Hung's return to the great Hungarian Plains,

258
00:14:59.081 --> 00:15:02.860
but only long enough to regain their strength and numbers before marching out

259
00:15:02.861 --> 00:15:05.800
for wall. Once more, they sat out again in 450,

260
00:15:05.801 --> 00:15:08.800
but this time they did not attack the Eastern Roman empire,

261
00:15:08.890 --> 00:15:12.100
instead of focused his attention on its Western counterparts.

262
00:15:12.340 --> 00:15:15.130
This was a somewhat surprising decision Attila,

263
00:15:15.140 --> 00:15:17.230
not one to conquer Constantinople anymore.

264
00:15:17.320 --> 00:15:19.540
Emperor Theodosius died that same year,

265
00:15:19.690 --> 00:15:21.850
and he was followed on the throne by Marcien.

266
00:15:21.880 --> 00:15:25.720
The latter used to be a general and took a markedly different approach to

267
00:15:25.721 --> 00:15:26.710
dealing with the Hunzas.

268
00:15:26.711 --> 00:15:30.130
He immediately ended the treaty between them and stopped all payments.

269
00:15:30.370 --> 00:15:31.570
Not that he needed one,

270
00:15:31.571 --> 00:15:35.110
but this would have been the perfect justification for a Tila to attack the

271
00:15:35.111 --> 00:15:36.880
Eastern Roman empire once more.

272
00:15:37.060 --> 00:15:40.300
But he did not deviate from his invasion plans of the West.

273
00:15:40.420 --> 00:15:42.010
According to a story in Jordanians,

274
00:15:42.100 --> 00:15:45.640
the tiller wanted to go that way because he also intended to attack the

275
00:15:45.641 --> 00:15:47.650
Visigoths not just the Romans.

276
00:15:47.800 --> 00:15:51.790
He may or may not have been doing this at the request of gay Sarek King of the

277
00:15:51.791 --> 00:15:55.660
vandals who showered the leader of the hunters with gifts and incited him

278
00:15:55.840 --> 00:16:00.550
against Thea Doric King of the Visigoths for his own personal revenge

279
00:16:01.090 --> 00:16:05.140
until his expressed reason for invading the Western Roman empire was a strange

280
00:16:05.141 --> 00:16:08.500
and unique one emperor in the West was Valentini on the set.

281
00:16:08.650 --> 00:16:13.330
He had a sister named honoria who was engaged to marry a Senator named

282
00:16:13.331 --> 00:16:17.650
basses hacky Lunis. This marriage had been arranged by her brother,

283
00:16:17.860 --> 00:16:20.380
but honoria had no desire to go through with it.

284
00:16:20.381 --> 00:16:24.160
So of all the people in the world, she sought out help from Attila, the hun,

285
00:16:24.310 --> 00:16:26.260
sending him a note and a ring.

286
00:16:26.530 --> 00:16:30.520
Now we don't know what was written in the notes and what kind of help honoria

287
00:16:30.521 --> 00:16:31.271
was expecting,

288
00:16:31.271 --> 00:16:34.690
but Attila chose to interpret her proposal as an offer of marriage.

289
00:16:34.720 --> 00:16:37.930
Not only that, but he felt he was do you half the Western Roman empire,

290
00:16:38.110 --> 00:16:42.430
his dowry even sent a messenger to Valentini and to confirm that the proposal

291
00:16:42.431 --> 00:16:46.660
had been legitimate and the Tila would come to claim what was his it's doubtful

292
00:16:46.661 --> 00:16:48.190
that Tila cares about the marriage? Well,

293
00:16:48.191 --> 00:16:52.030
there's he actually expected the Roman emperor to just handover half of his

294
00:16:52.031 --> 00:16:52.570
empire.

295
00:16:52.570 --> 00:16:57.100
This was most likely just another convenient excuse for him to wage a bit of war

296
00:16:57.280 --> 00:17:00.310
in 451 Atilla invaded Roman gold.

297
00:17:00.880 --> 00:17:03.430
Jordyn's claims that his army numbered half a million men,

298
00:17:03.431 --> 00:17:07.930
but modern historians place it lower at around 200,000 men, either way.

299
00:17:08.020 --> 00:17:08.853
It was eight,

300
00:17:08.860 --> 00:17:12.220
the middle force that quickly snorted all of those who stood in its way.

301
00:17:12.340 --> 00:17:16.900
So he's like tree air in that's captured and plundered almost with no

302
00:17:16.901 --> 00:17:20.890
opposition. You know, the old saying the enemy of my enemy is my friends. Well,

303
00:17:21.100 --> 00:17:25.570
that is how the Romans felt as well because Valentina and requested the help of

304
00:17:25.571 --> 00:17:26.980
the nearby Gothic factions,

305
00:17:27.070 --> 00:17:30.550
he would have almost certainly been fighting the Roman empire.

306
00:17:30.730 --> 00:17:31.690
Were it not for the hunts?

307
00:17:31.840 --> 00:17:35.350
He sends an ambassador with a message bravest of nations.

308
00:17:35.490 --> 00:17:39.610
It is the policy of prudence for us to unite against the Lord of the earth,

309
00:17:39.611 --> 00:17:43.840
who wishes to enslave the whole world. He requires no just cause for battle,

310
00:17:43.990 --> 00:17:46.150
but supposes, whatever he does is right.

311
00:17:46.360 --> 00:17:49.060
He measures his ambition by his might license,

312
00:17:49.080 --> 00:17:53.430
satisfies his pride despite his law and writing shows himself and enemy to

313
00:17:53.450 --> 00:17:54.150
nature.

314
00:17:54.150 --> 00:17:59.100
And thus he who clearly is the common foe of each deserves the hatred of all

315
00:17:59.280 --> 00:18:02.220
the Franks, the Saxons, the Burgundians, the islands,

316
00:18:02.221 --> 00:18:05.160
and especially the Visigoths led by King Theodore Eric,

317
00:18:05.550 --> 00:18:10.050
or realize that they were just as much in danger from the Huns as the Romans

318
00:18:10.051 --> 00:18:14.550
were. So they agreed to forming the lines to fight a teller and his army.

319
00:18:20.840 --> 00:18:21.470
<v 1>[Inaudible].</v>

320
00:18:21.470 --> 00:18:24.200
<v 0>Well, the challenge against the Huns was Flavius ATS.</v>

321
00:18:24.230 --> 00:18:27.380
The same commander who wants, fought along side them against the Burgundians.

322
00:18:27.440 --> 00:18:30.470
He led a coalition of nations and met the Huns of the battle of Shalom.

323
00:18:30.500 --> 00:18:35.480
Also known as the battle of Catalunian fields on June the 20th 451,

324
00:18:35.481 --> 00:18:36.830
a deep up to that point.

325
00:18:36.860 --> 00:18:40.220
This had been one of the bloodiest military conflicts in history as eye

326
00:18:40.221 --> 00:18:44.180
witnesses reported the planes filling up with thousands of bodies piles on top

327
00:18:44.181 --> 00:18:46.880
of one another. They also said that within the hunting camp,

328
00:18:47.090 --> 00:18:50.870
Attila had made a massive funeral path for himself and was prepared to throw

329
00:18:50.871 --> 00:18:53.750
himself on it, to burn alive rather than be captured.

330
00:18:53.960 --> 00:18:57.260
Historians have varied opinions on the outcome of this conflict and its

331
00:18:57.261 --> 00:18:58.280
historical impact,

332
00:18:58.310 --> 00:19:01.880
but most would agree that the Romans in the Visigoth has won the battle.

333
00:19:01.970 --> 00:19:03.560
Although with heavy casualties,

334
00:19:03.590 --> 00:19:08.030
Kings Theodora fell in battle and his son swordsmens wanted to invade the camp

335
00:19:08.031 --> 00:19:09.680
and wipe out the hums once. And for all,

336
00:19:09.740 --> 00:19:12.890
they probably could have done it to where it not for atheists actually

337
00:19:12.891 --> 00:19:16.520
intervening on behalf of a tiller and convincing the young thorugh, Siemens,

338
00:19:16.550 --> 00:19:20.870
this as the new King of the Visigoth scene needed to return to that capital of,

339
00:19:20.871 --> 00:19:24.830
to lose and to consolidate his power against his plotting brothers.

340
00:19:25.040 --> 00:19:27.020
Why would ATS do such a thing though,

341
00:19:27.170 --> 00:19:29.930
when he had an opportunity to rid himself of the Huns?

342
00:19:30.170 --> 00:19:33.710
Well that's because a fear that the Visigoths had the potential to turn into an

343
00:19:33.740 --> 00:19:37.520
even more dangerous foe when he was a lot closer to his borders,

344
00:19:37.610 --> 00:19:38.990
as long as the tiller was around,

345
00:19:39.140 --> 00:19:43.670
he served as a useful common enemy United the Romans and the golfs.

346
00:19:43.910 --> 00:19:45.860
So tele was able to retrieve,

347
00:19:45.890 --> 00:19:50.240
living to fight another day and fight he did as less than a year had passed

348
00:19:50.241 --> 00:19:53.930
before the Hung's returns to a tax, the Western Roman empire. Again,

349
00:19:54.080 --> 00:19:58.280
this time they went straight into Italy, clearly intends on pillaging,

350
00:19:58.281 --> 00:20:01.460
the most significant Roman sediments, the city of Akron layer,

351
00:20:01.520 --> 00:20:05.540
India to the West of it being almost completely raised the grounds afterwards,

352
00:20:05.541 --> 00:20:08.360
the Huns continued into the province of Benicia,

353
00:20:08.361 --> 00:20:11.270
where they plundered more sediments. According to tradition,

354
00:20:11.390 --> 00:20:13.430
this led to the founding of the city of Venice.

355
00:20:13.580 --> 00:20:17.990
It was settled by refugees who left other cities in order to escape the Huns.

356
00:20:18.020 --> 00:20:21.740
And they correctly surmised that Attila's cavalry's would not follow them into

357
00:20:21.741 --> 00:20:24.800
the lagoon that encloses Venice, without a Gothic muscle,

358
00:20:24.801 --> 00:20:26.930
the Romans were not capable of stopping a tiller.

359
00:20:27.170 --> 00:20:30.860
Eventually the emperor sent multiple envoys to try and secure a piece with the

360
00:20:31.310 --> 00:20:33.140
Huns. And one of them was Pope Leo.

361
00:20:33.141 --> 00:20:37.160
The first contemporary sources gave Leo the credit for convincing Attila to turn

362
00:20:37.161 --> 00:20:40.880
back after having been impressed with Leo's words and his piety,

363
00:20:41.150 --> 00:20:43.460
the exact details of that meeting are known,

364
00:20:43.461 --> 00:20:47.680
but modern historians give more practical reasons for a Tiller's withdrawal,

365
00:20:47.710 --> 00:20:50.710
such as a lack of resources due to a famine disease,

366
00:20:50.711 --> 00:20:54.490
which spread among his soldiers and the fact that an army from the Eastern Roman

367
00:20:54.491 --> 00:20:58.660
empire crossed the Danube and launched a counter attack on hunt settlements,

368
00:20:58.720 --> 00:21:02.710
whatever the reason that's Ella would have surely invaded once more given the

369
00:21:02.711 --> 00:21:06.730
opportunity. However, his life came to an end in 453,

370
00:21:06.731 --> 00:21:10.720
a D while celebrating his marriage to a new wife named IL Dico.

371
00:21:10.930 --> 00:21:12.490
According to ancient historian.

372
00:21:12.940 --> 00:21:16.000
PRISCUS the leader of the Huns fell on his bed in a drunken stupor with his head

373
00:21:16.001 --> 00:21:16.691
tilted back.

374
00:21:16.691 --> 00:21:21.160
And he choked on his own blood either from a burst blood vessel or from a very

375
00:21:21.161 --> 00:21:24.340
powerful nosebleed alternative hypothesis has been put forward,

376
00:21:24.341 --> 00:21:26.410
such as elder go assassinating him,

377
00:21:26.411 --> 00:21:30.910
or until her dying of internal bleeding caused by excessive drinking in morning,

378
00:21:30.911 --> 00:21:34.840
all the hum soldiers cut their long hair and slashed that SHEEX so that the

379
00:21:34.841 --> 00:21:36.940
greatest of all warriors should be mourned,

380
00:21:36.970 --> 00:21:41.590
not with tears or the wailing of women, but with the blood of men,

381
00:21:41.890 --> 00:21:43.120
according to their traditions,

382
00:21:43.121 --> 00:21:46.390
it was really important for that chief teen's burial place to be anonymous.

383
00:21:46.600 --> 00:21:49.270
Of course, they never had a chief Dame greater than the Tila.

384
00:21:49.270 --> 00:21:51.670
So he was placed inside three coffins,

385
00:21:51.790 --> 00:21:54.970
a gold one inside a silver one inside an odd one.

386
00:21:55.120 --> 00:21:59.110
The coffin was then buried in a river bed and the people who did it were killed

387
00:21:59.111 --> 00:22:01.210
so that there would be nobody left alive,

388
00:22:01.211 --> 00:22:04.480
who knew where the final resting place of Attila the hun.

389
