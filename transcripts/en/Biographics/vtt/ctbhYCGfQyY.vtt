you know that I appreciate scaps product line,

4
00:00:09.300 --> 00:00:12.600
and this is a particularly exciting time because manscape has actually just

5
00:00:12.601 --> 00:00:15.360
released their fourth generation trimmer,

6
00:00:15.620 --> 00:00:20.400
the all new Lama 4.0 with feedback from millions of customers across

7
00:00:20.570 --> 00:00:20.951
the globe.

8
00:00:20.951 --> 00:00:24.070
<v 1>The landscape team has engineered the next generation of growing and body</v>

9
00:00:24.071 --> 00:00:28.030
trimmers by focusing on intelligent functionality. So this,

10
00:00:28.170 --> 00:00:30.070
as I say is the Lamur 4.0,

11
00:00:30.071 --> 00:00:33.430
it's got these advanced ceramic blades right there at the top.

12
00:00:33.431 --> 00:00:36.590
And there's something called skin safe technology, which believe me,

13
00:00:36.591 --> 00:00:38.390
where this is designed to shape.

14
00:00:38.530 --> 00:00:42.540
You do want something called skin safe technology, Nicks,

15
00:00:42.560 --> 00:00:45.900
and cuts down below are just bad times.

16
00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:49.100
You turn it on BU off it goes. Boom.

17
00:00:49.540 --> 00:00:51.420
And then I just say goodbye to some arm hair.

18
00:00:51.820 --> 00:00:54.100
<v 0>It's cordless, it's waterproof. So you can trim in the shower.</v>

19
00:00:54.460 --> 00:00:56.820
It's super convenient. Also when it comes to charging this,

20
00:00:56.910 --> 00:01:00.780
isn't a slouch like other trimmers. It's not gonna die every five minutes.

21
00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:04.570
Indeed. You can get 90 minutes of charging from a full charge.

22
00:01:04.571 --> 00:01:06.850
And how do you charge? Well it's wards proof.

23
00:01:07.030 --> 00:01:10.730
So it's wireless boom slotted in there, like an electric toothbrush.

24
00:01:10.731 --> 00:01:12.650
You do need to plug in this bottom part,

25
00:01:12.651 --> 00:01:16.810
but that is very easy enough through this port in the back, easy peasy.

26
00:01:17.030 --> 00:01:21.210
So star looking good from head to toe with no pair of stones left unearned join

27
00:01:21.211 --> 00:01:23.280
more than two in men, world. Why, who trust?

30
00:01:38.780 --> 00:01:41.400
So do we really need an introduction for Pavlo Picasso?

31
00:01:41.401 --> 00:01:44.990
It is difficult to argue against the idea that he was the most important

32
00:01:45.460 --> 00:01:49.790
influential and recognizable artist of the 20th century in today's biographics.

33
00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:54.350
We will explore the turning points of his career and the salient events of his

34
00:01:54.351 --> 00:01:55.180
private life.

35
00:01:55.180 --> 00:01:59.830
Many of these events were controversial to save the least and would have dire

36
00:01:59.831 --> 00:02:04.420
consequences for those lucky enough or unlucky enough to be close to the

37
00:02:04.421 --> 00:02:07.180
painter, but we have nine decades to cover.

38
00:02:07.400 --> 00:02:10.820
So let's dip our brushes and get right into it.

39
00:02:16.920 --> 00:02:21.860
It was the 25th of October, 1881 in Malaga and EUC, Southern Spain,

40
00:02:22.030 --> 00:02:24.330
local painter arts sea, true, a museum curator,

41
00:02:24.930 --> 00:02:26.770
hos Jose Ruiz Blasco and his wife,

42
00:02:26.771 --> 00:02:29.970
Maria Picasso Lopez welcomes their firstborn trials.

43
00:02:30.160 --> 00:02:33.530
This baby would later sign his masterpiece as simply as Picasso,

44
00:02:33.590 --> 00:02:37.530
but he was christened as Pablo di hos Jose Francisco to Paula,

45
00:02:37.920 --> 00:02:39.250
Juan Neen,

46
00:02:39.380 --> 00:02:44.280
Maria de Los Reio Sapriano de Andina Trinidad Ru as

47
00:02:44.460 --> 00:02:47.520
Picato. Oh my God. That was an insane mouthful.

48
00:02:47.580 --> 00:02:52.160
And I'm sure I destroyed the pronunciation on it with a name like that.

49
00:02:52.161 --> 00:02:55.200
We may consider his birth certificate as his first work of art.

50
00:02:55.270 --> 00:02:56.760
Many would follow from an early age.

51
00:02:56.980 --> 00:02:59.360
Boy PLO was introduced to art by his father,

52
00:02:59.760 --> 00:03:02.480
a good teacher with great technical knowledge.

53
00:03:02.630 --> 00:03:06.200
Picasso would later acknowledge the strong influence that his mother and aunt

54
00:03:06.300 --> 00:03:08.680
had on him. His mother, Maria in particular,

55
00:03:08.770 --> 00:03:13.320
would boost ego telling him things like when you grow up, if you are a soldier,

56
00:03:13.700 --> 00:03:18.000
you'll become general. If you are a priest, you'll become Pope.

57
00:03:18.140 --> 00:03:22.910
The and feminine influence on PLO have led some biographers to infer an eatable

58
00:03:22.940 --> 00:03:26.110
complex and a strong antagonism towards his father.

59
00:03:26.370 --> 00:03:29.550
<v 1>But actually Picasso always respected his father,</v>

60
00:03:30.070 --> 00:03:32.150
Jose and acknowledged his teachings and influence.

61
00:03:32.210 --> 00:03:36.790
He would later say every time my draw a man automatically, I think of my father,

62
00:03:37.090 --> 00:03:40.540
as far as I am concerned, the man is Don Jose.

63
00:03:40.840 --> 00:03:45.300
And that will be so as long as I live, as Pablo grew up,

64
00:03:45.301 --> 00:03:47.340
his father realized his incredible talent.

65
00:03:47.341 --> 00:03:50.540
Sometimes asking the boy to finish his paintings for him.

66
00:03:50.980 --> 00:03:53.380
PLO would also create his own works of art at the time,

67
00:03:53.430 --> 00:03:57.300
still inspired by classic conventional and academic art,

68
00:03:57.560 --> 00:04:02.450
but he already showed a keynote I for certain subjects that would reemerge in

69
00:04:02.451 --> 00:04:05.530
later life bull fighting. For example, by 1891,

70
00:04:05.531 --> 00:04:07.850
the Rus Picassos were not doing great.

71
00:04:07.850 --> 00:04:12.570
<v 0>Financially and PLU had been joined by younger sisters conception and Lola,</v>

72
00:04:12.630 --> 00:04:15.850
and just went on. Jose could do with some extra money.

73
00:04:16.070 --> 00:04:20.400
The municipality of Malaga at shut down the museum that he was working at dad

74
00:04:20.401 --> 00:04:21.360
was suddenly jobless.

75
00:04:21.361 --> 00:04:26.240
So he relocated the entire family to LA on the Northwestern coast of

76
00:04:26.241 --> 00:04:26.881
Spain. There,

77
00:04:26.881 --> 00:04:30.480
he was offered a new job as a drawing teacher with PLO was one of his students

78
00:04:30.580 --> 00:04:34.920
at the age of 14 young Ruez Picasso was painting oil paintings of family,

79
00:04:34.921 --> 00:04:39.080
friends, but also subjects that were more on the fringes of society.

80
00:04:39.340 --> 00:04:43.870
The celebration and rep of mists would be another recurring scene in

81
00:04:44.220 --> 00:04:46.870
Picasso's career worth mentioning for this period,

82
00:04:47.450 --> 00:04:50.750
the old fisherman and the barefoot girl. Then in 1895,

83
00:04:50.751 --> 00:04:54.950
the family experienced a tragedy daughter, conception, knowns, Cita,

84
00:04:55.310 --> 00:04:57.790
contracted diptheria. Pablo made a pact with got,

85
00:04:57.791 --> 00:05:01.540
he would renounce painting if he let KTA. So vibe,

86
00:05:01.690 --> 00:05:06.460
unfortunately she died according to biographer, John Richardson, this left day,

87
00:05:06.860 --> 00:05:09.380
profound and lasting sense of guilt in PLOS psyche.

88
00:05:09.390 --> 00:05:12.940
After the tragedy family moved again. This time to Barcelona here,

89
00:05:13.220 --> 00:05:17.740
Don Jose would be teaching at Lalo the most prominent local art school.

90
00:05:17.960 --> 00:05:21.460
The move was a godsend for PLO. Barcelona was a thrill.

91
00:05:21.690 --> 00:05:25.130
I think cultural center influenced by autistic innovators that emanated from

92
00:05:25.131 --> 00:05:27.810
Paris. Again, PLO enrolled in his father's school,

93
00:05:27.811 --> 00:05:32.610
impressing other teachers and examiners with his maturing techniques in 1896,

94
00:05:32.970 --> 00:05:36.370
PLO started to attract the attention of the press and prize juries,

95
00:05:36.371 --> 00:05:38.490
thanks to his canvases science and charity.

96
00:05:38.710 --> 00:05:43.640
And first communion by depicting this Catholic right passage PLO marked his

97
00:05:43.641 --> 00:05:46.720
own symbolic transition from childhood to adulthood,

98
00:05:47.150 --> 00:05:52.000
from students to future Maro in the Autum of 1897 PLO left

99
00:05:52.110 --> 00:05:55.320
Barcelo to study at the Royal academy of San Fernando in Madrid.

100
00:05:55.510 --> 00:05:57.000
This was a great opportunity,

101
00:05:57.180 --> 00:06:01.600
but he disliked the stuffy curriculum and preferred to spend hours at the prodo

102
00:06:01.601 --> 00:06:05.400
museum admiring the masters, his poor attendance record angered Don ho,

103
00:06:05.640 --> 00:06:07.600
Jose who decided to cut Pablo's allowance.

104
00:06:07.700 --> 00:06:10.360
The young painters spent a miserable winter in Madrid.

105
00:06:10.361 --> 00:06:14.840
He was cold bill and painless. A friends. Man, Polaris came to the rescue,

106
00:06:15.240 --> 00:06:19.270
inviting him to spend eight months native village in Catalonia Horter air, bro.

107
00:06:19.340 --> 00:06:21.110
This was a small town on the mountains,

108
00:06:21.430 --> 00:06:25.350
geographically and culturally far removed from the Bartel of Madrids and

109
00:06:25.740 --> 00:06:27.590
Barcelona. That PLO loved so much.

110
00:06:27.810 --> 00:06:30.630
And yet the months in Horter were a crucial transformative moments.

111
00:06:30.990 --> 00:06:34.590
Another right of passage PLO would later often say everything.

112
00:06:34.670 --> 00:06:39.540
I know I learned in PLAR village in H PLO learns how to harvest

113
00:06:39.980 --> 00:06:43.020
tan grapes, how to sheer sheep and slaughter of pigs.

114
00:06:43.080 --> 00:06:46.860
He connected with nature and the traditions of rural Catalonia.

115
00:06:47.280 --> 00:06:49.220
He removed himself from civilizations.

116
00:06:49.780 --> 00:06:53.740
He and man retired for weeks at a cave there. Pablo honed his skills,

117
00:06:53.741 --> 00:06:57.380
sketching and painting the landscapes and the local people in February 18, 19,

118
00:06:57.730 --> 00:06:59.090
he had regained his health and his energy.

119
00:06:59.150 --> 00:07:03.130
He was going to return to Barcelona no longer as a student, but as an artist,

120
00:07:03.820 --> 00:07:05.050
ready to take on the world

121
00:07:11.400 --> 00:07:12.330
Back in Barcelona.

122
00:07:12.460 --> 00:07:17.090
Pad's favorite horns became the Tavern ELs Qura GATS saw the four cats.

123
00:07:17.240 --> 00:07:21.320
This cafe was modeled after the famous per Parisian cabaret lair,

124
00:07:21.910 --> 00:07:26.440
microcosm of young and daring intellectuals and artists PLO stood out thanks to

125
00:07:26.441 --> 00:07:29.360
his charisma and energy soon, making friends with painter,

126
00:07:29.640 --> 00:07:34.200
Carl Casa gamers and poet, James Sabars Pau began to make a name for himself,

127
00:07:34.220 --> 00:07:37.000
but that name wasn't PLO. It was Picasso.

128
00:07:37.180 --> 00:07:38.910
His cattle and friends decide did that.

129
00:07:38.911 --> 00:07:43.510
His father's surname Ruiz was too commonplace for such an original character.

130
00:07:43.610 --> 00:07:46.270
His mothers instead had an exotic ring,

131
00:07:46.271 --> 00:07:49.910
which suited the young artist in February, 1900, the 18 year old PICA.

132
00:07:50.110 --> 00:07:52.750
So exhibited 150 works at the four cats.

133
00:07:52.850 --> 00:07:55.910
It was such a success that several drawings were published and one painting.

134
00:07:56.220 --> 00:08:00.820
Last moments was chosen for the universal ex in Paris. After this success,

135
00:08:00.850 --> 00:08:03.060
Picasso decided to move to Paris after all.

136
00:08:03.060 --> 00:08:07.340
That's where the real art was at in October of 1900 Picasso and his friend Casso

137
00:08:07.500 --> 00:08:12.220
game has moved into a studio in Maass where they drank life to the DRS.

138
00:08:12.221 --> 00:08:15.140
They frequented artists, dancers, cafes, museums,

139
00:08:15.141 --> 00:08:18.060
and Townville reput Picasso fell in love with tooo.

140
00:08:18.380 --> 00:08:23.010
The Trek Ingar found a good client in an art dealer in Pedro Manak,

141
00:08:23.770 --> 00:08:25.730
Carl Case, a game as meanwhile, fell in love with a young lady,

142
00:08:26.250 --> 00:08:29.010
Laura Gar Gallo known as Jermaine Jermaine,

143
00:08:29.011 --> 00:08:33.650
eventually rejected Carl's who may have already been suffering from depression

144
00:08:33.670 --> 00:08:34.570
on February the 17th,

145
00:08:34.890 --> 00:08:38.010
1901 Picas was back in Barcelona when he received Daron news,

146
00:08:38.570 --> 00:08:40.680
cuz a gamers had tried to shoot germane. Mr.

147
00:08:40.940 --> 00:08:45.920
And later turned the gun on himself and Picasso was deeply shocked in 1901.

148
00:08:45.921 --> 00:08:47.760
He dedicated three paintings to his friend,

149
00:08:47.761 --> 00:08:50.320
the most famous one being the death of Casa gamers,

150
00:08:50.680 --> 00:08:52.280
a large candle on the right hand side,

151
00:08:52.350 --> 00:08:55.800
illuminates the background in strong hu of red, orange, yellow,

152
00:08:55.820 --> 00:08:57.440
and green in sharp contrast.

153
00:08:57.460 --> 00:09:02.200
The face of Gar and the foreground is tinted and pale blues and greens.

154
00:09:02.380 --> 00:09:03.480
In Picasso's own words,

155
00:09:03.700 --> 00:09:07.360
the death of his friend initiated what became known as his blue period.

156
00:09:07.590 --> 00:09:11.080
This is when he painted almost in monogram, favoring shades of blue and blue,

157
00:09:11.320 --> 00:09:13.240
green only occasionally using other colors.

158
00:09:13.260 --> 00:09:17.750
The themes are also subtly blue or permeated by a sense of sadness. Uh,

159
00:09:18.230 --> 00:09:18.991
desolation and depression.

160
00:09:18.991 --> 00:09:21.670
Typical subjects of the blue period include prisoners,

161
00:09:21.671 --> 00:09:25.550
beggars or traveling performers like the old guitarist from 1903.

162
00:09:25.730 --> 00:09:29.630
The painting gives Picasso the occasion to celebrate the downtrodden of society.

163
00:09:29.770 --> 00:09:34.190
But the old blind musician and his angular posture are also a homage to on a

164
00:09:34.191 --> 00:09:38.220
Picasso's favorite O Greco. After the death of cast gamers,

165
00:09:38.370 --> 00:09:40.700
Picasso returned to Paris in may of 1901.

166
00:09:41.060 --> 00:09:44.820
He lived briefly in his friend's old apartments and even had a short

167
00:09:44.821 --> 00:09:47.740
relationship with Jermaine between 1901 and 1904.

168
00:09:47.900 --> 00:09:50.300
The painter traveled back and forth between Paris and Spain,

169
00:09:50.301 --> 00:09:54.460
further developing his style and technique perhaps influenced by his friends and

170
00:09:54.490 --> 00:09:58.410
poet. Max, Jacob, the Casos are drifted away from reality.

171
00:09:58.520 --> 00:10:02.850
Instead he tried to express the subjective and spiritual experiences of what he

172
00:10:02.851 --> 00:10:05.170
was living during another period of financial hardship.

173
00:10:05.171 --> 00:10:07.770
The Caso could not afford oil paint yet to resort,

174
00:10:07.930 --> 00:10:11.330
to drawing only which refined his technique and made him pay greater attention

175
00:10:11.550 --> 00:10:13.490
to space and anatomy. Finally,

176
00:10:13.500 --> 00:10:16.400
after settling in Paris for good in April of 1904,

177
00:10:16.720 --> 00:10:20.840
the Caso was about to shed his old blue skin and enter a new period

178
00:10:21.340 --> 00:10:22.200
tinted in rose.

179
00:10:28.860 --> 00:10:32.440
The rose period covers Picasso's activity from 1904 to 1906,

180
00:10:32.500 --> 00:10:35.840
the cold and somber blues gradually gave way to a warmer palette.

181
00:10:35.841 --> 00:10:37.870
Dominat by ping orange and red,

182
00:10:37.970 --> 00:10:40.830
the subject Speare less desperate than those in the blue period,

183
00:10:41.010 --> 00:10:43.710
but still had an air ofensive melancholy.

184
00:10:43.711 --> 00:10:46.870
They were often circus troops or street urchins.

185
00:10:47.030 --> 00:10:51.230
So frequenters the battle lair building hosting dozens of small artists

186
00:10:51.620 --> 00:10:56.150
studios. One of them is the boy with a pipe portrayed in 1905.

187
00:10:56.590 --> 00:11:01.300
And the battle Picasso met and fell in love with a model fer and Olivia who

188
00:11:01.520 --> 00:11:04.060
did not find him particularly seductive even still.

189
00:11:04.061 --> 00:11:08.820
She could not deny that the inner fire that you felt in him gave off a kind of

190
00:11:08.821 --> 00:11:13.620
magnetism. The two began an affair and fer ends became the painters muse,

191
00:11:14.000 --> 00:11:17.420
heated her, but adoration came with darker shade,

192
00:11:17.630 --> 00:11:19.690
possessiveness and jealousy.

193
00:11:19.840 --> 00:11:22.530
Picasso insisted that further ends give up modeling.

194
00:11:22.530 --> 00:11:24.890
And when she expressed a desire to pains,

195
00:11:25.250 --> 00:11:29.410
Pueblo dismissed her aspiration saying that women should not tres into male

196
00:11:29.690 --> 00:11:31.930
territory. Every time Picasso left their apartment,

197
00:11:31.990 --> 00:11:35.170
he locked her inside and took away the key. He agreed to give her a key.

198
00:11:35.240 --> 00:11:37.690
Only when she almost died in a house far,

199
00:11:37.710 --> 00:11:41.840
it was one of the earliest signs that Picasso struggled to maintain normal,

200
00:11:41.841 --> 00:11:44.480
healthy relationships with women artistically though,

201
00:11:44.481 --> 00:11:47.160
Picasso was finding new Heights, critics, collectors,

202
00:11:47.161 --> 00:11:50.200
and other artists all took notice of the rose period.

203
00:11:50.360 --> 00:11:52.480
Artworks Picasso made influential friends,

204
00:11:52.481 --> 00:11:57.360
such as writer and art patron Gerr Stein, poet, Gillam, Aire writers,

205
00:11:57.720 --> 00:12:00.120
Jean and Francis Scott Fitzgerald,

206
00:12:00.220 --> 00:12:03.920
as his popularity grew Picasso was ready to shed his new skin and enter a new

207
00:12:03.921 --> 00:12:08.600
period, which would eventually lead him to cubism from autumn 1905 to autumn of

208
00:12:08.800 --> 00:12:09.281
1906.

209
00:12:09.281 --> 00:12:12.990
The painter absorbed a string of influences that would ultimately show shape is

210
00:12:12.991 --> 00:12:13.824
remaining work.

211
00:12:13.910 --> 00:12:17.990
Changing the art world forever Picasso began studying the work of Paul Saan

212
00:12:17.991 --> 00:12:22.590
absorbing his concept that the artists should capture the process rather than

213
00:12:22.730 --> 00:12:24.190
the results of vision.

214
00:12:24.380 --> 00:12:28.390
This allowed artists to depict multiple angles of the same object at once free

215
00:12:28.391 --> 00:12:32.590
from the constraints of one point perspective. Then in the summer of 1906,

216
00:12:32.950 --> 00:12:36.100
Picasso and financed took a trip to Gool and Catalonia here,

217
00:12:36.540 --> 00:12:37.980
Pablo took to carving wood and sculptures,

218
00:12:37.981 --> 00:12:40.820
which influenced his later depiction of the human face. Finally,

219
00:12:40.830 --> 00:12:41.900
after returning to Paris,

220
00:12:41.920 --> 00:12:44.820
the painter visited exhibitions of prehistoric Spanish sculpture,

221
00:12:45.040 --> 00:12:47.420
as well as African and oceanic masks.

222
00:12:47.560 --> 00:12:52.180
All of these influences can be seen in his portrait of Gertrude Stein of 1906,

223
00:12:52.200 --> 00:12:56.130
in which Picasso red, please simplified her face into a stylized mask.

224
00:12:56.350 --> 00:13:00.410
It could be said that this is when Pablo stopped painting what he saw and

225
00:13:00.411 --> 00:13:04.770
started painting what he thought the influences of the past months erupted into

226
00:13:04.810 --> 00:13:09.690
a watershed work of art, the Deel AOR, or the young women of a,

227
00:13:16.580 --> 00:13:20.360
The original title of the brothel of avenue in reference to a street and

228
00:13:20.390 --> 00:13:24.080
Barcelona known for prostitution, not the French town. So yes,

229
00:13:24.081 --> 00:13:28.760
there was absolutely no mystery on these young ladies professional status that

230
00:13:28.761 --> 00:13:32.680
explains the bold and solicitors gaze of the five women with a noted

231
00:13:32.681 --> 00:13:36.990
undercurrent of sexual tension, painting shocked Picasso's friends and critics,

232
00:13:36.991 --> 00:13:40.790
not only for its theme, but especially for the technique that he used.

233
00:13:40.890 --> 00:13:42.430
He distorted the body of the models,

234
00:13:42.910 --> 00:13:46.430
challenging the traditional idealization of female beauty. Moreover,

235
00:13:46.650 --> 00:13:49.510
he emitted perspective. There is no vanishing point,

236
00:13:49.910 --> 00:13:54.230
nowhere for the eye to escape, no way to avoid the young women in their glance.

237
00:13:54.910 --> 00:13:58.860
The launch canvas was the turning point away from the African or primitive

238
00:13:58.920 --> 00:14:00.660
period entered into cubism.

239
00:14:00.930 --> 00:14:04.060
Picasso developed this style in partnership with painter, George brag,

240
00:14:04.130 --> 00:14:07.860
both influenced by Saan the two sliced the pictorial space,

241
00:14:07.861 --> 00:14:09.500
attempting to see all angles at once.

242
00:14:09.570 --> 00:14:13.620
They ditched scale and perspective shapes were simplified into blocks.

243
00:14:13.730 --> 00:14:17.170
They painted the analysis us of a form instead of its appear.

244
00:14:17.560 --> 00:14:22.210
They also introduced the technique of collage by embedding found objects or even

245
00:14:22.420 --> 00:14:23.730
trash into their work.

246
00:14:23.840 --> 00:14:28.330
They performed an unprecedented synthesis combining everyday chaos into the

247
00:14:28.331 --> 00:14:32.290
beauty of art. Pablo's art started selling well and in the Autum of 1909,

248
00:14:32.550 --> 00:14:36.560
he and finance were able to move into a proper apartment together. Years later,

249
00:14:36.710 --> 00:14:40.280
just when his fame was soaring PLO dumped his muse beginning an affair with

250
00:14:40.281 --> 00:14:44.480
model Eva Goel. The paintings she inspired are marked by the words Maly.

251
00:14:44.880 --> 00:14:49.080
My beautiful fame brought some unwanted attention to when Theona Lisa was stolen

252
00:14:49.081 --> 00:14:52.040
from the Louv in August, 1911, poet, Gillam,

253
00:14:52.560 --> 00:14:56.320
Aire and Picasso were celebrity suspects. Picasso was innocent. Of course,

254
00:14:56.600 --> 00:15:00.480
although he confessed to buying Iberian statue S PED from the Lou almost exactly

255
00:15:00.481 --> 00:15:04.240
three years later, poller would go through a much worse ordeal as world war.

256
00:15:04.280 --> 00:15:06.440
I broke out. He was called to arms the same fate,

257
00:15:06.680 --> 00:15:11.070
but felt many in Picasso's circle, but not him as a citizen of, for Spain.

258
00:15:11.090 --> 00:15:15.670
He was under no obligation to serve all he suffered was solitude and melancholy

259
00:15:15.671 --> 00:15:18.710
made worse in December of 1915, when Eva died of tuberculosis,

260
00:15:18.990 --> 00:15:23.470
a depressed Picasso was rescued by Jean cocktail in the March of 1916,

261
00:15:23.530 --> 00:15:27.190
he involved the painter in parade show of ballet Rus,

262
00:15:27.191 --> 00:15:30.030
which was a troop led by ballet and Presario.

263
00:15:30.470 --> 00:15:35.140
So 11 Picazo designed stage decor and masks for the dancers.

264
00:15:35.280 --> 00:15:38.140
All in Cubist style, even got to tour with the troop.

265
00:15:38.460 --> 00:15:41.140
Bob visiting Rome Pompe in Naples in 1917,

266
00:15:41.160 --> 00:15:44.700
he absorbed the influence of ancient classical art. At the same time,

267
00:15:44.701 --> 00:15:45.900
he courted one of the dancers,

268
00:15:46.010 --> 00:15:50.820
Ukrainian Olgo Cockle over not one to move slow Picasso and Olgo married one

269
00:15:50.821 --> 00:15:52.770
year later. And she, he became his leading muse,

270
00:15:52.840 --> 00:15:57.130
inspiring someone hundred and 40 works of art that belonged to his next phase.

271
00:15:57.590 --> 00:15:59.410
The classic period in the first works.

272
00:15:59.930 --> 00:16:02.690
Olga is portrayed as a delicate in melancholic beauty later,

273
00:16:03.010 --> 00:16:05.410
she morphs into a disfigured threatening presence,

274
00:16:05.630 --> 00:16:08.770
but she was not the monster in this story over the course of their marriage.

275
00:16:08.800 --> 00:16:11.850
Picasso had several affairs, physically assaulted IANS even,

276
00:16:12.040 --> 00:16:15.560
and kept her sedated when it was convenient for him in November of 1921,

277
00:16:15.630 --> 00:16:19.640
Picasso dumped her just when she was pregnant with the first child PLO,

278
00:16:19.710 --> 00:16:22.400
Picasso and Olga tried to reconcile. But in 1927,

279
00:16:22.401 --> 00:16:26.280
he started in new affair just when August's health was deteriorating due to

280
00:16:26.281 --> 00:16:29.680
cancer. The new mistres was 17 year old, Marie three's Walter.

281
00:16:29.940 --> 00:16:33.910
He had met her by total chance outside department in store captivated by her

282
00:16:33.911 --> 00:16:37.150
beauty, the painter grabs the girl by her arm and said, I am Picasso.

283
00:16:37.490 --> 00:16:41.710
You and I are going to do great things together. What they did together was,

284
00:16:42.020 --> 00:16:44.710
well, you can use your imagination on that one.

285
00:16:44.950 --> 00:16:49.110
Their relationship was passionate and intensely sexual preferably with as

286
00:16:49.111 --> 00:16:50.190
sadistic element to it.

287
00:16:50.191 --> 00:16:54.780
It appears that Maria Reese was at times fight of having sex with Picasso who

288
00:16:55.090 --> 00:16:56.580
enjoyed seeing a cry.

289
00:16:56.690 --> 00:17:00.940
This type of relationship permeated works like figures at the seaside of 1931.

290
00:17:01.000 --> 00:17:05.100
The canvas is full of sexual symbols, but there is a threatening element to it.

291
00:17:05.460 --> 00:17:09.380
Stylistically figures also portrays the influence of the surrealist movement in

292
00:17:09.730 --> 00:17:12.540
Picasso's friendship with Salvador Darley on September the fifth,

293
00:17:12.740 --> 00:17:16.330
1935 gave birth to Picasso's daughter Meyer,

294
00:17:16.350 --> 00:17:18.610
who he would portray frequently for the rest of his life.

295
00:17:18.790 --> 00:17:20.730
The couple instead split shortly afterwards,

296
00:17:20.970 --> 00:17:24.970
occasionally reigniting their affair. Many years later in 1977, Marie three,

297
00:17:24.971 --> 00:17:28.850
Walter hung herself. Another relationship concluded over the summer of 1935.

298
00:17:28.960 --> 00:17:33.050
This is when Olga left PLO. Good. Although he never conceded a divorce,

299
00:17:33.530 --> 00:17:36.720
their marriage of a ended only on February the 11th, 1955,

300
00:17:36.721 --> 00:17:40.000
when she died of cancer, 1935 was a troubled year in general.

301
00:17:40.350 --> 00:17:44.560
Picasso had been going through a creative block once a darling of the press and

302
00:17:44.561 --> 00:17:47.560
the Avantgarde circles. He was now facing negative reviews.

303
00:17:47.700 --> 00:17:49.440
The master was settling into a pattern.

304
00:17:49.740 --> 00:17:54.360
He needed to enter a new period to revitalize his art and to enter a new period.

305
00:17:54.740 --> 00:17:56.360
He was going to need a new muse,

306
00:18:02.690 --> 00:18:05.440
Quite promptly. A new muse came right along poet,

307
00:18:05.630 --> 00:18:09.470
painter and photographer Henry at Theo or, or Markovich,

308
00:18:09.471 --> 00:18:11.390
better known as Dora ma.

309
00:18:11.650 --> 00:18:14.830
She was a Picasso side from 1936 to 1943,

310
00:18:14.850 --> 00:18:18.670
but the inspiration for Picasso's best known work would not come from love.

311
00:18:19.130 --> 00:18:23.350
But from tragedy on July the 18th, 1936, the Spanish civil war broke out.

312
00:18:23.370 --> 00:18:27.190
The conflict opposed to the Republican government was a military insurgency.

313
00:18:27.290 --> 00:18:28.230
The Bando.

314
00:18:28.610 --> 00:18:33.500
Now the officers were initially led by general San Hua and later by

315
00:18:33.501 --> 00:18:36.100
general Franco who secured military help from fascist,

316
00:18:36.540 --> 00:18:38.380
literally and Nazi Germany in 1937,

317
00:18:38.381 --> 00:18:41.660
the Republican government asked Picasso to paint a mural for the Spanish

318
00:18:41.740 --> 00:18:44.140
pavilion at the Paris universal exposition.

319
00:18:44.240 --> 00:18:48.140
The painter chose the subject after hearing the news from gr Republican

320
00:18:48.270 --> 00:18:52.610
stronghold in country in Norman, Spain on April the 26th,

321
00:18:52.890 --> 00:18:57.210
19 37 45, Italian and German planes, carpet bombed and strayed Greca.

322
00:18:57.211 --> 00:19:01.810
They destroyed 70% of the town and Guild or wounded 1,600 civilians,

323
00:19:01.811 --> 00:19:03.690
which was a third of the population.

324
00:19:03.720 --> 00:19:07.490
This was the first instance of large scale bombing used against a civilian

325
00:19:07.550 --> 00:19:11.360
target and Oman of the impending horrors of the near future.

326
00:19:11.740 --> 00:19:14.560
The Caso denounced the massacre by painting a monumental canvas,

327
00:19:14.610 --> 00:19:17.240
3.5 meters tall and 7.8 meters white.

328
00:19:17.500 --> 00:19:20.240
He painted quickly to meet the deadline of the exhibition.

329
00:19:20.430 --> 00:19:22.480
Dora Mars photos documented the process,

330
00:19:22.630 --> 00:19:26.800
providing some insight into how Picasso changed his mind several times on the

331
00:19:26.801 --> 00:19:27.880
composition of the canvas,

332
00:19:28.190 --> 00:19:31.230
even down so that the choice of colors halfway through the process,

333
00:19:31.231 --> 00:19:33.910
perhaps inspired by Dora zone, black and white photos.

334
00:19:34.210 --> 00:19:37.150
The cast decided to adopt an almost monocratic palette,

335
00:19:37.600 --> 00:19:39.750
black dark blue and white.

336
00:19:39.980 --> 00:19:43.910
Another pseudo improvised element is the head of the horse at the center of the

337
00:19:43.911 --> 00:19:45.870
canvas, taken together with the bull on the left.

338
00:19:45.871 --> 00:19:48.230
These animals represent the most dominant elements.

339
00:19:48.410 --> 00:19:52.540
The horse represents the suffering of the people of Gran while the bull Embodi

340
00:19:52.690 --> 00:19:57.620
brutality and darkness GCA helped to further cement Picasso's reputation

341
00:19:57.621 --> 00:19:58.360
worldwide.

342
00:19:58.360 --> 00:20:02.940
He was even honored with a large exhibition new York's MoMA in 1939,

343
00:20:02.970 --> 00:20:07.300
when the German army occupied Paris in June of 1940 Picasso benefited in part

344
00:20:07.301 --> 00:20:08.460
from his international standing,

345
00:20:08.560 --> 00:20:11.730
he was clearly an antifascist and producer of degenerate R arts,

346
00:20:11.970 --> 00:20:14.770
but the occupational authorities allowed him to continue to work.

347
00:20:14.771 --> 00:20:18.850
Sometimes German officials would try to offer him extra privileges sometimes as

348
00:20:18.851 --> 00:20:21.410
simple as extra coal or food rations, naturally,

349
00:20:21.411 --> 00:20:23.530
they were expecting some works of art in exchange,

350
00:20:23.630 --> 00:20:26.010
but the cast ever accepted these exchanges,

351
00:20:26.190 --> 00:20:30.290
all they ever gave these officials were postcards of gua to be kept as a

352
00:20:30.291 --> 00:20:32.010
souvenir during the occupation year,

353
00:20:32.280 --> 00:20:36.000
as his work reflected the grim reality of the period in paintings like seated

354
00:20:36.240 --> 00:20:39.840
women subject matter focused on the private introspective sphere,

355
00:20:40.060 --> 00:20:42.360
the colors are dull. The shapes aggressive,

356
00:20:42.361 --> 00:20:46.960
the mood claustrophobic Picasso also expressed himself through sculpture with

357
00:20:47.100 --> 00:20:49.160
the best example, being man with a lamb,

358
00:20:49.161 --> 00:20:52.320
which has been interpreted both as a symbol of suffering under German,

359
00:20:52.680 --> 00:20:54.800
yo and hope for impending liberation

360
00:21:01.060 --> 00:21:04.880
In may of 1943, Picasso was ready for another transition in his personal life.

361
00:21:04.980 --> 00:21:09.350
He met the you aspiring pains. Uh, Fran was while still living with Dora.

362
00:21:09.670 --> 00:21:12.510
Occasionally he still saw his former lover Marie through his Walter.

363
00:21:12.810 --> 00:21:16.590
He cut ties with both Walter and do and ordered start a new relationship with

364
00:21:17.030 --> 00:21:18.710
Gallo, which would almost last 10 years.

365
00:21:19.110 --> 00:21:23.070
The couple had two children clawed in 1947 and Palo in 1949.

366
00:21:23.250 --> 00:21:26.790
But their affair was plague by infidelity and emotional abuse.

367
00:21:27.130 --> 00:21:30.100
Picasso explained very clearly to Fran was that for him,

368
00:21:30.270 --> 00:21:32.180
there are only two kinds of women,

369
00:21:32.610 --> 00:21:36.540
goddesses and doormats Gillo was not willing to become a doormat.

370
00:21:36.560 --> 00:21:41.220
So she instead became the only woman to ever leave Picasso in 1953,

371
00:21:41.580 --> 00:21:43.820
she later published memoir on their life together,

372
00:21:43.821 --> 00:21:46.620
revealing some of the artists nears and darker traits.

373
00:21:46.770 --> 00:21:50.490
Picasso also vaccinated between bouts of depression, uncontrollable, temperance,

374
00:21:50.810 --> 00:21:54.210
absolute sadism, which he expressed in the form of cruel pranks.

375
00:21:54.230 --> 00:21:58.570
He also had a tendency to remade obsessively on single ideas or topics and

376
00:21:59.010 --> 00:22:01.570
maintained compulsive rituals. For example, every morning,

377
00:22:01.571 --> 00:22:04.210
he had a recite mentally a list of his closest friends.

378
00:22:04.590 --> 00:22:07.770
One day he forgot to include his friends. Maurice ran later in that day,

379
00:22:07.771 --> 00:22:10.600
he learned of his unexpected death and was deeply perturbed.

380
00:22:10.670 --> 00:22:14.800
This episode shows how as a balance to Picasso's myriad of negative traits,

381
00:22:14.801 --> 00:22:17.840
he could care deeply about others, friends, certain family members,

382
00:22:18.100 --> 00:22:20.240
and the general downtrodden of society.

383
00:22:20.460 --> 00:22:24.040
As a result of his relationship with Gillo, who was a communist sympathizer,

384
00:22:24.190 --> 00:22:26.800
Picasso shifted decidedly to the left. In fact,

385
00:22:26.801 --> 00:22:28.320
after the end of the German occupation,

386
00:22:28.400 --> 00:22:31.270
he for formally joins the French communist party. In the following years,

387
00:22:31.370 --> 00:22:33.750
he painted party posters and a portrait of Stalin.

388
00:22:33.850 --> 00:22:37.750
He accepted Thelen and peace prize in 1950 and attracted the attention of us

389
00:22:37.751 --> 00:22:42.750
authorities with massacre in Korea. This 1951 canvas was a commentary on us,

390
00:22:42.751 --> 00:22:45.030
atrocities committed against north Korean civilians.

391
00:22:45.031 --> 00:22:49.420
Eventually Picasso came under FBI scrutiny who suspected him of spying on behalf

392
00:22:49.421 --> 00:22:50.300
of the USSR,

393
00:22:50.400 --> 00:22:54.580
the politics were not the major concern of the mystery who is now in his

394
00:22:54.581 --> 00:22:55.240
seventies.

395
00:22:55.240 --> 00:22:58.940
He had started yet another new relationship with a lady who had become his final

396
00:22:59.050 --> 00:23:02.740
love and muse Jacqueline rock 47 years as junior.

397
00:23:03.040 --> 00:23:04.740
The two would marry in 1961,

398
00:23:04.760 --> 00:23:08.460
and Jacqueline would be portrayed more than 70 times by the aging painter

399
00:23:08.650 --> 00:23:11.770
marking by a far, the most productive years of his long career.

400
00:23:12.040 --> 00:23:15.770
Picasso had entered a period of frenzied activity dedicated to revisiting and

401
00:23:15.771 --> 00:23:19.690
recreating works by early masters that he had marched starting in 1957.

402
00:23:19.691 --> 00:23:23.410
He produced 58 works in which he reinterpreted less mens,

403
00:23:23.490 --> 00:23:27.850
a 17th century masterpiece by da que from 1959 to

404
00:23:27.970 --> 00:23:32.880
1961 applied the same approach to on the by Mennet the series inspired by

405
00:23:32.881 --> 00:23:35.240
the impressionist consists of 140 drawings,

406
00:23:35.241 --> 00:23:38.680
27 paintings at four linoleum cuts during the 1960s.

407
00:23:38.750 --> 00:23:41.680
Picasso's most recurring theme was the female nude.

408
00:23:41.820 --> 00:23:43.520
It was as if approaching death,

409
00:23:43.580 --> 00:23:46.280
the old master wanted to delay as much as possible.

410
00:23:46.620 --> 00:23:51.480
The threats of decay and impotence such a vast amount of work required peace and

411
00:23:51.481 --> 00:23:51.681
quiet,

412
00:23:51.681 --> 00:23:56.680
which PLO and Jacqueline sought by moving to the secluded shadow Tove nag

413
00:23:56.700 --> 00:23:57.640
in Southern France,

414
00:23:57.890 --> 00:24:01.240
while there Jacqueline would make sure on the master's time was protected,

415
00:24:01.241 --> 00:24:04.910
barring even his eldest son PLO from visiting him in 19 6,

416
00:24:04.910 --> 00:24:08.390
4 Picasso himself extended the veto to his other children, clawed and PLO.

417
00:24:08.650 --> 00:24:10.990
The reason was the publication of his former lover.

418
00:24:11.350 --> 00:24:15.470
Fran SWO AFA mentioned memoir life with Picasso Picasso sued his former lover

419
00:24:15.471 --> 00:24:17.230
and tried to prevent the publication of the work.

420
00:24:17.250 --> 00:24:20.630
But the court involved concluded that this work far from defaming the great

421
00:24:20.631 --> 00:24:25.460
painter, reveals him as a man of astonishing interior richness and an extremely

422
00:24:25.461 --> 00:24:26.294
attractive figure.

423
00:24:32.860 --> 00:24:35.940
PLO Ruiz Picasso died on April the eighth of 1973,

424
00:24:36.000 --> 00:24:40.540
age 91 Jacquelyn spent the night next to his body, laid out on a Mo of snow.

425
00:24:40.770 --> 00:24:43.220
Picasso was a colosus of the art world.

426
00:24:43.560 --> 00:24:48.450
The personification of genius life spans nine decades and his vision influenced

427
00:24:48.451 --> 00:24:51.650
the creation of some of the most important movements in modern art.

428
00:24:51.990 --> 00:24:54.450
The engine that propelled his work were his passions,

429
00:24:54.730 --> 00:24:58.250
the lessons from the old masters politics society,

430
00:24:58.630 --> 00:25:03.330
and most of all his MUEs and yet that same passionate art that could create so

431
00:25:03.331 --> 00:25:07.880
easily and could elevate those rounds. Him could destroy just as easily.

432
00:25:08.720 --> 00:25:12.120
Olga Pablo's first wife was abused and neglected while ill with cancer.

433
00:25:12.720 --> 00:25:14.880
Marie threes, Walter ultimately took her own life.

434
00:25:14.900 --> 00:25:18.800
And so did Jacqueline rock after years of alcoholism and depression,

435
00:25:19.150 --> 00:25:22.240
Dora Mar was also abused, eventually suffering a mental breakdown.

436
00:25:22.350 --> 00:25:25.880
Picasso seemed to have a deleterious influence on blood relatives too.

437
00:25:25.940 --> 00:25:30.590
His son blow died an alcoholic after years of depression powers son PTO

438
00:25:30.591 --> 00:25:33.870
poisoned himself with a bottle of bleach and he was barred from his

439
00:25:33.871 --> 00:25:34.704
grandfather's funeral.

440
00:25:35.090 --> 00:25:39.230
So while the world rightfully remembers him as the master painter of the 20th

441
00:25:39.231 --> 00:25:42.350
century and the founder of cubism. So to,

442
00:25:42.490 --> 00:25:46.990
was he OUS eccentric slowly scraping the life off the many friend

443
00:25:47.620 --> 00:25:52.260
and family members in his orbits, the Casos mu may have given him inspiration,

444
00:25:52.600 --> 00:25:55.860
but that transaction rarely came without personal cost.

445
00:25:56.210 --> 00:25:59.740
Such was the nature of a complex artistic visionary.

446
00:26:00.060 --> 00:26:04.980
As Polito system arena described it. He submitted them to his animal, sexuality,

447
00:26:05.510 --> 00:26:10.490
tamed them, but which them ingested them and crushed them into his canvas.

448
00:26:10.900 --> 00:26:13.530
After he had spent many nights extracting their essence,

449
00:26:14.040 --> 00:26:17.170
once they were bled dry, he would dispose of them.

450
00:26:20.350 --> 00:26:22.330
