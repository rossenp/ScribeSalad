1
00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:03.780
<v 0>Well, the body of a man was found on a beach in Australia over 70 years ago.</v>

2
00:00:03.840 --> 00:00:07.290
Nobody yet knew that the investigation that would follow would turn it into one

3
00:00:07.291 --> 00:00:09.810
of the country's greatest mysteries there's even today,

4
00:00:09.990 --> 00:00:13.830
we cannot say anything with certainty about what happens on that occasion,

5
00:00:13.980 --> 00:00:18.720
who that man was, how he ended up on that beach, who killed him. And indeed,

6
00:00:18.810 --> 00:00:22.350
if he was even murdered are still questions waiting for an answer.

7
00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:25.200
Was he a spurns lover who decided to end it all?

8
00:00:25.201 --> 00:00:30.090
Or was he actually an international spy who was assassinated within

9
00:00:30.091 --> 00:00:33.720
explicable twists and turns usually found in the pages of a good thriller novel.

10
00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:38.100
This investigation became known worldwide as the mystery of the summer to man or

11
00:00:38.101 --> 00:00:42.690
the Talman should case they will be taken an in-depth look at a real life who

12
00:00:42.691 --> 00:00:46.080
done it, which will include untraceable, poisons, hidden messages,

13
00:00:46.081 --> 00:00:48.720
encrypted codes, rare books, secret love affairs.

14
00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:51.360
And of course a cold blooded murder.

15
00:00:51.440 --> 00:00:52.273
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

16
00:00:57.680 --> 00:00:59.570
<v 0>It all started on the morning of December, the first,</v>

17
00:00:59.571 --> 00:01:03.440
1948 on the summit and park beach in Adelaide Australia,

18
00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:06.650
police had arrived at the scene after receiving a call about the body of a

19
00:01:07.160 --> 00:01:10.880
middle-aged man lying in the sand halfway propped up against a sea wall to

20
00:01:10.881 --> 00:01:14.660
horseback riders were the ones who had made the grisly discovery at around 6:00

21
00:01:14.660 --> 00:01:19.010
AM and alerted the authorities after going in for a closer look to make sure

22
00:01:19.011 --> 00:01:22.250
that the man was indeed dead. Police found him to be in his early forties,

23
00:01:22.251 --> 00:01:25.040
smartly dressed, wearing a clean suit and a polished,

24
00:01:25.041 --> 00:01:27.650
a pair of nice shoes in a bus stick in his pocket,

25
00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:31.460
which had purchased the day before indicating that he had not been present in

26
00:01:31.970 --> 00:01:33.620
Summerton earlier that previous afternoon,

27
00:01:33.950 --> 00:01:37.940
he also has an unused second class railway ticket to a nearby suburb named

28
00:01:38.060 --> 00:01:41.870
Henley beach, and Alemanian cone a half empty pack of chewing gum.

29
00:01:41.930 --> 00:01:46.550
The box of matches and strangest of all a pack of army club, brand cigarettes,

30
00:01:46.551 --> 00:01:50.810
which actually contained cigarettes from a different brand called Kansas.

31
00:01:51.110 --> 00:01:51.531
It's awkward.

32
00:01:51.531 --> 00:01:54.830
The neighbors reveals that they had seen a man sitting in that same spot the

33
00:01:54.831 --> 00:01:55.461
night before,

34
00:01:55.461 --> 00:01:59.690
but they all assumes that he was either sleeping or drunk and left him alone.

35
00:01:59.810 --> 00:02:03.320
One couple claimed they saw him around 7:00 PM while out for a stroll and said

36
00:02:03.321 --> 00:02:03.920
at one point,

37
00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:08.030
the man extended one arm upward before letting it fall limp again afterwards,

38
00:02:08.031 --> 00:02:09.230
he remained perfectly still.

39
00:02:09.231 --> 00:02:12.440
Even though there were still many mosquitoes buzzing around his face.

40
00:02:12.770 --> 00:02:13.760
Another couple of saw him later.

41
00:02:13.761 --> 00:02:16.850
And while they thought it was bizarre that the stranger was dressed in a suit at

42
00:02:16.851 --> 00:02:19.640
the beach, they also did not go in closer to investigate.

43
00:02:19.940 --> 00:02:21.470
There were no obvious signs of islands.

44
00:02:21.471 --> 00:02:24.260
So investigators initially concluded that the man became ill,

45
00:02:24.380 --> 00:02:27.260
sat down and propped himself up against the wall for a rest,

46
00:02:27.261 --> 00:02:31.460
fell asleep or passed out and then died during the night. It was unusual,

47
00:02:31.490 --> 00:02:35.090
but hardly had the markings for one of the country's greatest mysteries.

48
00:02:35.480 --> 00:02:39.980
But then the autopsy happens and things started to get weird. First pathologist,

49
00:02:40.010 --> 00:02:43.490
John Barkley Bennett concluded that the mysterious stranger had died no earlier

50
00:02:43.520 --> 00:02:45.740
than 2:00 AM, which means that he was still alive.

51
00:02:45.741 --> 00:02:48.080
When everybody saw him the previous night,

52
00:02:48.081 --> 00:02:50.600
although he had been clearly incapacitated.

53
00:02:50.601 --> 00:02:54.830
Somehow the doctor agreed that the dead man was somewhere between 40 and 45

54
00:02:54.831 --> 00:02:58.430
years old. And that there were no signs of islands on the body. In fact,

55
00:02:58.431 --> 00:03:01.900
he had been in great condition. His body was fixed and his heart was healthy,

56
00:03:01.901 --> 00:03:04.450
even though it was heart failure, which had actually killed him.

57
00:03:04.600 --> 00:03:07.600
This was a bit counter-intuitive to someone who dropped dead on the beach.

58
00:03:07.601 --> 00:03:11.020
So the pathologist started to suspect that foul play might've been involved.

59
00:03:11.230 --> 00:03:13.420
He looked for signs of poisoning and found them.

60
00:03:13.630 --> 00:03:15.730
The pupils were small and unusual.

61
00:03:15.731 --> 00:03:18.610
The spleen was around three times the normal size and the liver,

62
00:03:18.640 --> 00:03:20.920
the kidneys and the stomach were all filled with blood.

63
00:03:21.160 --> 00:03:24.640
Moreover being poisoned would also have explained the stranger's behavior from

64
00:03:24.641 --> 00:03:28.330
the previous night where he had seemingly been alive yet unable to move or

65
00:03:28.331 --> 00:03:31.420
communicate with anyone. Apart from the single arm spasm,

66
00:03:31.630 --> 00:03:34.510
it was starting to look like a clear case of poisoning.

67
00:03:34.780 --> 00:03:37.330
Although whether the man took that poison willingly or not,

68
00:03:37.720 --> 00:03:39.220
we're still inconclusive anyway,

69
00:03:39.221 --> 00:03:43.120
to be sure the pathologist sent samples to a chemistry lab to check for toxins,

70
00:03:43.150 --> 00:03:47.320
which they did and found nothing. No cyanides no alkaloids,

71
00:03:47.321 --> 00:03:51.010
no phenols, no barbiturates, not a trace of any of them.

72
00:03:51.190 --> 00:03:54.250
Later during the investigation, it eminence pharmacologists named sir,

73
00:03:54.270 --> 00:03:58.510
Cedric Stanton Hicks indicated this very potent poison was like the use,

74
00:03:58.511 --> 00:04:01.630
which decomposed soon after his death and left no trace.

75
00:04:01.690 --> 00:04:06.430
He suggested straw fans in or digitalis. Although whether he was right or not,

76
00:04:06.431 --> 00:04:08.500
it became impossible to prove. In the end,

77
00:04:08.520 --> 00:04:11.590
even though the pathologist was convinced that the death could not have been

78
00:04:11.591 --> 00:04:15.280
natural, he could not reach a conclusion regarding the cause of death.

79
00:04:15.370 --> 00:04:17.800
Meanwhile, the police were trying to identify the body,

80
00:04:17.801 --> 00:04:21.820
which the media had taken to calling the summit to man. But the sorts of go on,

81
00:04:22.090 --> 00:04:24.520
there was no wallet with the body. And in fact,

82
00:04:24.550 --> 00:04:26.440
there was no form of identification at all.

83
00:04:26.710 --> 00:04:29.350
His dental records could not be matched to any known person.

84
00:04:29.351 --> 00:04:32.170
And even the labels on his clothes had been removed.

85
00:04:32.260 --> 00:04:36.130
His fingerprints were not found in any Australian database and even reaching out

86
00:04:36.131 --> 00:04:40.120
to international help in Britain and the United States yielded no results.

87
00:04:40.180 --> 00:04:42.820
His photograph was circulated throughout the entire country.

88
00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:45.340
And even though dozens of people came to view the body.

89
00:04:45.730 --> 00:04:47.290
Nobody ultimately recognized him.

90
00:04:47.440 --> 00:04:51.070
The only mind leads that could possibly help with identification were a few

91
00:04:51.071 --> 00:04:53.860
unusual physical traits discovered during the autopsy.

92
00:04:54.040 --> 00:04:58.180
But some of the man had very smooth and soft hands showing no signs of manual

93
00:04:58.181 --> 00:05:01.510
labor, but he had extremely well-developed calf muscles.

94
00:05:01.540 --> 00:05:05.260
The most pronounced that the pathologist had have seen his toes were also

95
00:05:05.261 --> 00:05:08.860
wedge-shaped indicating that the victim more pointed shoes with high heels,

96
00:05:09.100 --> 00:05:12.700
these facts together suggested that maybe the Somerton man had been a ballet

97
00:05:12.701 --> 00:05:14.830
dancer or a long distance runner.

98
00:05:21.180 --> 00:05:21.780
<v 2>[Inaudible].</v>

99
00:05:21.780 --> 00:05:22.441
<v 0>Most of the new year,</v>

100
00:05:22.441 --> 00:05:25.560
the police had exhausted all their leads and the summer to man was still a

101
00:05:25.561 --> 00:05:28.770
ghost. Some still argued that his death have been a suicide,

102
00:05:28.771 --> 00:05:32.850
but why would someone develop such a complex method of taking their own life and

103
00:05:33.240 --> 00:05:34.073
more to the point,

104
00:05:34.110 --> 00:05:37.470
how could they do so they would have to first be able to get their hands on a

105
00:05:37.471 --> 00:05:39.810
potent poison that could not be traced back to them.

106
00:05:39.811 --> 00:05:44.070
Then somehow erase all records of their existence and make sure that nobody came

107
00:05:44.071 --> 00:05:46.560
forward to identify them in January authorities.

108
00:05:46.650 --> 00:05:50.100
It widens their investigations to the point where they began examining all

109
00:05:50.101 --> 00:05:54.180
discarded or lost luggage found in Adelaide hotels and railway stations in the

110
00:05:54.181 --> 00:05:56.850
hopes that one of them might've belonged to that victim.

111
00:05:56.930 --> 00:06:01.250
It seems like an act of desperation, but it did produce results. On January.

112
00:06:01.251 --> 00:06:04.940
The 14th staff from the Adelaide railway station came forward with a suitcase

113
00:06:04.941 --> 00:06:06.410
that had been sitting in their cloak room.

114
00:06:06.440 --> 00:06:08.540
Since the morning of November the 30th,

115
00:06:08.570 --> 00:06:11.510
the timing lines up nicely is the previous evidence scanners.

116
00:06:11.511 --> 00:06:15.860
It was also suggested that that was the day that someone to man arrived in

117
00:06:15.861 --> 00:06:20.180
Adelaide, but there was nothing conclusive to connect the two together, even.

118
00:06:20.181 --> 00:06:22.040
So police took what they could get.

119
00:06:22.160 --> 00:06:24.500
The suitcase pretty much contains what you would expect,

120
00:06:24.501 --> 00:06:28.070
a traveling man to have with him. Multiple items of clothing, shaving kit, shoe,

121
00:06:28.430 --> 00:06:30.650
Polish toothbrush, and toothpaste, a table knife,

122
00:06:30.651 --> 00:06:34.010
a pair of scissors and pencils, some handkerchiefs and a lighter.

123
00:06:34.400 --> 00:06:37.310
They're only slightly unusual items in the suitcase where a stenciling brush

124
00:06:37.340 --> 00:06:41.000
typically used for stenciling cargo on merchant ships and a sewing kit

125
00:06:41.030 --> 00:06:45.440
containing a Barbie brand orange wax threads that was not available in Australia

126
00:06:45.441 --> 00:06:46.160
at the time.

127
00:06:46.160 --> 00:06:49.820
One other small clue was the stitch whack on a coat found in the suitcase,

128
00:06:49.821 --> 00:06:53.240
which was unknown in Australia, but was commonly used in America.

129
00:06:53.300 --> 00:06:57.080
These signs pointed to the possibility that the Somerton man may have traveled

130
00:06:57.110 --> 00:07:01.220
to the United States at one point or may have even worked as a sailor like

131
00:07:01.221 --> 00:07:04.940
before all labels and other identifying markers had been painstakingly removed

132
00:07:04.941 --> 00:07:08.810
from the clothing except for three tags with the name T keen on them.

133
00:07:08.930 --> 00:07:11.450
This lead proved to be another dead end though. It was,

134
00:07:11.451 --> 00:07:14.930
nobody was missing by that name in the end of the police concluded that whoever

135
00:07:14.960 --> 00:07:18.710
removed all the other labels left the ones with keen on them because they knew

136
00:07:18.711 --> 00:07:18.910
it was.

137
00:07:18.910 --> 00:07:19.743
<v 3>Leave nowhere.</v>

138
00:07:25.750 --> 00:07:28.240
<v 0>If you thought this case was confusing up until this point,</v>

139
00:07:28.480 --> 00:07:32.500
don't worry because they got a whole lot more mysterious in June of 1949,

140
00:07:32.501 --> 00:07:36.940
when a new clue veer to the investigation from unsolved murder into spy thriller

141
00:07:36.941 --> 00:07:40.660
territory and new scientist was brought in to lend his expertise pathology

142
00:07:40.661 --> 00:07:41.494
professor.

143
00:07:41.680 --> 00:07:46.630
So John Burton Clellan in the hopes that he might spot something that everyone

144
00:07:46.631 --> 00:07:47.464
else had missed.

145
00:07:47.500 --> 00:07:50.950
He drew a few conclusions regarding the evidence that had already been analyzed.

146
00:07:51.010 --> 00:07:53.950
For example, we mentioned that the somewhat a man wore nice looking shoes,

147
00:07:53.951 --> 00:07:56.110
but the truth is that they were not simply nice.

148
00:07:56.111 --> 00:08:00.220
They were spotless and did not look like the shoes of a man who walked on the

149
00:08:00.221 --> 00:08:00.790
beach.

150
00:08:00.790 --> 00:08:03.940
There was also no vomit on the clothes or in the area where the victim was

151
00:08:03.941 --> 00:08:07.300
found, which is unusual seeing as the victim was poisons,

152
00:08:07.450 --> 00:08:10.780
this made it Kyle and suspect that the man had been poisoned elsewhere and then

153
00:08:10.781 --> 00:08:14.320
dumped on the beach and capacitated, but still alive in the end,

154
00:08:14.800 --> 00:08:17.740
colons felt pretty confident that the summer to man died from poison,

155
00:08:17.741 --> 00:08:21.400
but he too admitted defeat when it came to establishing the cause of death.

156
00:08:21.580 --> 00:08:23.800
After Cleland was finished with his investigation,

157
00:08:23.830 --> 00:08:25.720
it was time to actually bury the victim.

158
00:08:25.721 --> 00:08:28.570
As the body had started to decompose even say, well,

159
00:08:28.571 --> 00:08:32.260
authorities knew they might have been getting rid of one of their key pieces of

160
00:08:32.261 --> 00:08:35.560
evidence. So they took the unusual precautions of embalming,

161
00:08:35.561 --> 00:08:39.490
the summit of man first, then having plastic costs made of his head and torso.

162
00:08:39.520 --> 00:08:39.971
Finally,

163
00:08:39.971 --> 00:08:43.540
he was buried under concrete and dry grounds to make it easier to exume him,

164
00:08:43.541 --> 00:08:44.620
should the need arise.

165
00:08:44.770 --> 00:08:48.160
The second is more thorough examination of the victim's clothing did yield a

166
00:08:48.161 --> 00:08:48.580
new,

167
00:08:48.580 --> 00:08:52.840
strange and unique piece of evidence inside his trouser pockets had been sewn,

168
00:08:52.900 --> 00:08:55.710
a smaller fob pocket for a watch inside that pocket.

169
00:08:55.770 --> 00:08:59.220
It was a rolled up piece of paper with two words printed on it.

170
00:08:59.400 --> 00:09:03.240
Tom should in Persian, this meant finished or ended.

171
00:09:03.241 --> 00:09:06.390
And the motor itself often became identified as the tem.

172
00:09:06.390 --> 00:09:10.020
I'm sure to case because the words were written in such a distinctive script.

173
00:09:10.140 --> 00:09:13.800
So local police reporter with the Adelaide advertiser named Frank Kennedy

174
00:09:13.980 --> 00:09:17.640
actually recognized where they came from a book of 12th century,

175
00:09:17.641 --> 00:09:20.730
Persian poems calls the Rubaiyat of a marker,

176
00:09:21.240 --> 00:09:23.670
Yom the so-called astronomer poet Persia.

177
00:09:23.940 --> 00:09:26.580
You might think that this is incredibly obscure and archaic,

178
00:09:26.610 --> 00:09:30.150
but the truth is that the poems of remark a yarn were pretty much well known and

179
00:09:30.151 --> 00:09:32.160
popular in the English speaking world. At the time,

180
00:09:32.161 --> 00:09:36.270
following an 1859 translation by English writer, Edward Fitzgerald,

181
00:09:36.360 --> 00:09:40.380
this new evidence made some investigators hope on the suicide bandwagon. Again,

182
00:09:40.530 --> 00:09:43.950
Tom should what the last words in the poetry book and the permit itself was

183
00:09:43.951 --> 00:09:47.490
about living life to the fullest and having no regrets when it was time to die,

184
00:09:47.610 --> 00:09:50.640
the symbolism certainly suggested a person taking their own life.

185
00:09:50.670 --> 00:09:54.570
But of course it also could have easily been staged by someone trying to make it

186
00:09:54.571 --> 00:09:57.660
look like a suicide. In other words, just like up until this point,

187
00:09:57.870 --> 00:09:59.460
the police still knew nothing.

188
00:10:06.380 --> 00:10:08.420
The meaning of the words, Tom shirt aside,

189
00:10:08.421 --> 00:10:11.870
police became interested in the actual book where they came from.

190
00:10:12.110 --> 00:10:14.300
If they could somehow find that particular copy,

191
00:10:14.330 --> 00:10:17.420
maybe they could trace it back to the source where it was bought or borrowed

192
00:10:17.421 --> 00:10:21.860
from which in turn could provide some new clues to the identity of the person

193
00:10:21.861 --> 00:10:22.460
who took it.

194
00:10:22.460 --> 00:10:25.820
They started rummaging through all the bookshops and libraries in Adelaide and

195
00:10:25.821 --> 00:10:28.100
nearby towns, but struck out,

196
00:10:28.250 --> 00:10:31.880
they then put out a public appeal showing the distinctive scripts that the words

197
00:10:31.881 --> 00:10:36.380
were written in and hoped to get lucky, which they did on July the 22nd,

198
00:10:36.381 --> 00:10:39.560
1949, and then only identified under the pseudonym.

199
00:10:39.561 --> 00:10:43.070
Ronald Francis came forward with a copy of the Rubaiyat,

200
00:10:43.130 --> 00:10:45.770
which he saw in the glove box of his brother-in-law's cop.

201
00:10:45.830 --> 00:10:47.240
When he asked his relative about it.

202
00:10:47.241 --> 00:10:50.660
Francis said that somebody threw the book inside the car's backseat through an

203
00:10:50.690 --> 00:10:52.460
open window on November the 30th,

204
00:10:52.461 --> 00:10:55.190
while it was parked one block away from summit to beach,

205
00:10:55.370 --> 00:10:59.210
all signs pointed to this copy of the poetry book being the one where the scrap

206
00:10:59.211 --> 00:11:00.170
of paper came from.

207
00:11:00.170 --> 00:11:04.010
And then the police lined up the torn piece to the page from the book and they

208
00:11:04.011 --> 00:11:04.910
matched up perfectly.

209
00:11:05.090 --> 00:11:08.810
There was no more doubts that this was indeed the correct copy,

210
00:11:08.811 --> 00:11:13.280
but instead of helping to elucidate the mystery, it made it far more bizarre.

211
00:11:13.340 --> 00:11:14.120
For starters,

212
00:11:14.120 --> 00:11:18.500
this was a genuine first edition of the English translation from 1859.

213
00:11:18.680 --> 00:11:21.950
It was rare and valuable. And if it actually belonged to the summit of men,

214
00:11:21.951 --> 00:11:24.320
it was seemingly the only thing of value he possessed.

215
00:11:24.321 --> 00:11:28.730
And yet he treated it with more disdain than any other item casually discarding

216
00:11:28.731 --> 00:11:30.650
it in a random car that he walked by.

217
00:11:30.890 --> 00:11:34.790
And if he did not previously own that book and instead obtained it just to

218
00:11:34.791 --> 00:11:37.790
remove those two words and give us death some kind of symbolic,

219
00:11:37.820 --> 00:11:41.900
meaning why go to the trouble of getting such a rare copy and how come nobody

220
00:11:41.901 --> 00:11:45.350
remembered selling or blending it to em, or simply having it stolen?

221
00:11:45.620 --> 00:11:49.010
There was of course the other possibility that the copy did not belong to the

222
00:11:49.011 --> 00:11:51.740
summit of man and that his killer was in fact,

223
00:11:51.741 --> 00:11:55.840
the one who puts the torn paper in his trouser pocket and who also threw the

224
00:11:55.841 --> 00:11:57.940
book in the back of the car of Ronald Francis,

225
00:11:57.941 --> 00:12:01.360
his brother-in-law even so some of the same questions still applied.

226
00:12:01.390 --> 00:12:02.920
Why are you such a valuable book?

227
00:12:02.921 --> 00:12:06.880
And why didn't anybody report that they sold or lost a copy?

228
00:12:06.970 --> 00:12:09.550
What investigators inferred was that for whatever reason,

229
00:12:09.730 --> 00:12:11.830
it had to be this specific edition,

230
00:12:11.831 --> 00:12:14.980
which the owner probably brought with them from someplace else.

231
00:12:15.010 --> 00:12:16.300
So it could not be traced.

232
00:12:16.390 --> 00:12:19.600
The idea was given credence by two important clues found inside the book.

233
00:12:19.630 --> 00:12:21.970
One was a phone number penciled on the back cover.

234
00:12:22.210 --> 00:12:24.370
The other clue was markings of writing,

235
00:12:24.371 --> 00:12:27.820
which had been scribbled on something which had been placed on top of the book

236
00:12:27.970 --> 00:12:30.280
and then left behind faint indentations.

237
00:12:30.460 --> 00:12:33.970
There were five lines of seemingly random letters of which one line had been

238
00:12:33.971 --> 00:12:35.290
crossed out immediately.

239
00:12:35.291 --> 00:12:38.350
Investigators believe they represented some kind of secret code,

240
00:12:38.351 --> 00:12:41.590
which could have also potentially explained why the book had to be the original

241
00:12:41.591 --> 00:12:45.280
1859 version. The translations varied between different additions.

242
00:12:45.281 --> 00:12:48.190
So if the message was hidden inside the text of the book,

243
00:12:48.191 --> 00:12:51.820
the code might not have worked on any other edition, like all the other clues,

244
00:12:51.821 --> 00:12:52.750
this sounds plausible,

245
00:12:52.751 --> 00:12:56.170
but coming to you remain speculation because the code has never been cracked.

246
00:12:56.440 --> 00:12:59.170
So what about the other leaves? The phone number? It was unlisted,

247
00:12:59.171 --> 00:13:02.440
but police tracked it down to the house of a young woman who lived very close to

248
00:13:02.650 --> 00:13:05.410
somewhat of a beach during the investigation. The name was kept private.

249
00:13:05.411 --> 00:13:09.250
So she was always referred to by the nickname of Justin or the Susan named

250
00:13:10.360 --> 00:13:10.480
Theresa Johnson.

251
00:13:10.480 --> 00:13:13.510
It was only in recent years that our true identity was disclosed with the

252
00:13:13.511 --> 00:13:16.360
family's permission. She was Jessica Thompson at the time,

253
00:13:16.540 --> 00:13:19.960
27 year old nurse who was married to a man named prosper Thompson.

254
00:13:20.240 --> 00:13:22.180
She agreed to cooperate with the investigation.

255
00:13:22.210 --> 00:13:25.360
As long as the name was kept out of it. She went down to the mall.

256
00:13:25.400 --> 00:13:27.850
She couldn't see the body anymore because it had been buried,

257
00:13:28.000 --> 00:13:30.880
but she did look at the pasta casts taken of his head.

258
00:13:30.970 --> 00:13:35.110
Investigators noted her reaction as being odd is Thompson was completely taken

259
00:13:35.111 --> 00:13:37.540
aback and appeared as if she was about to faint.

260
00:13:37.630 --> 00:13:39.640
Given that she had been a nurse during the war,

261
00:13:39.790 --> 00:13:44.200
Thompson had surely seen a lot worse than the plaster cast of a dead body.

262
00:13:44.201 --> 00:13:48.610
So unsurprisingly investigators believed her reaction was caused by a close

263
00:13:48.611 --> 00:13:51.070
connection that she had with the deceased even.

264
00:13:51.071 --> 00:13:55.450
So Thompson then denied knowing who he was. As far as the book was concerned,

265
00:13:55.451 --> 00:13:57.430
she admitted that she once had a copy,

266
00:13:57.431 --> 00:14:01.180
which she gave to a soldier named Alfred Boxall in Sydney during the walk.

267
00:14:01.210 --> 00:14:04.360
She did not go into specifics as to the nature of their relationship.

268
00:14:04.390 --> 00:14:08.020
Although investigators obviously suspected a love of fat for a brief moment.

269
00:14:08.290 --> 00:14:11.590
Police hope that this would finally bring the case to an end. It was a tale.

270
00:14:11.620 --> 00:14:12.520
As old as time,

271
00:14:12.521 --> 00:14:16.600
they thought his Boxall was the jilted lover who decided to take his own life

272
00:14:16.630 --> 00:14:19.180
after visiting the woman. He loved one last time.

273
00:14:19.360 --> 00:14:22.090
There was just a tiny snag in that hypothesis. However,

274
00:14:22.091 --> 00:14:26.110
as they soon discovered that Alfred Boxell was alive and well and working as a

275
00:14:26.111 --> 00:14:28.630
bus maintenance officer in Randwick, not only that,

276
00:14:28.660 --> 00:14:31.750
but he still had his copy of the book complete with the words Tom and should.

277
00:14:31.990 --> 00:14:35.370
And it didn't even turn out to be the 1859 edition anyways.

278
00:14:35.371 --> 00:14:37.510
So well on that idea, I went out to the window.

279
00:14:43.320 --> 00:14:43.830
<v 1>[Inaudible].</v>

280
00:14:43.830 --> 00:14:46.230
<v 0>The dead end on the box is all theory, pretty much extinguished.</v>

281
00:14:46.231 --> 00:14:49.530
The last glimmer of hope that investigators had of solving this case.

282
00:14:49.980 --> 00:14:53.180
They'd pursued all the leads in each and every one of them had left the police

283
00:14:53.181 --> 00:14:56.330
more confused and uncertain than before the lack of concrete facts.

284
00:14:56.331 --> 00:14:56.990
In this case,

285
00:14:56.990 --> 00:14:59.870
the led to the appearance of rumors and hypotheses to fill the void.

286
00:14:59.871 --> 00:15:03.740
And one idea that still has a lot of support is that the summit to man had been

287
00:15:03.741 --> 00:15:07.280
a spy. It would explain a lot of the unusual aspects of the case,

288
00:15:07.281 --> 00:15:10.970
the intricate death, the untraceable poison, the book and the code.

289
00:15:11.120 --> 00:15:14.270
Some people even believe that Jessica Thompson had also been a spy.

290
00:15:14.271 --> 00:15:17.300
And this includes our own daughter, Kate and an interview.

291
00:15:17.301 --> 00:15:20.480
Kate recalled that her mother once made a reference to knowing exactly who the

292
00:15:20.690 --> 00:15:24.200
someone to man was, but would not go into detail. And on another occasion,

293
00:15:24.230 --> 00:15:27.290
Jessica admitted to being fluent in Russian. Although she,

294
00:15:27.291 --> 00:15:29.720
again would not say when she learned it,

295
00:15:29.960 --> 00:15:32.030
her family members also think it is possible.

296
00:15:32.031 --> 00:15:35.750
Jessica was having an affair with the summit to man and that our son, Robin,

297
00:15:35.751 --> 00:15:39.770
who was born a year before the summer demand died was actually his Jessica

298
00:15:39.770 --> 00:15:41.270
Thompson passed away in 2007.

299
00:15:41.271 --> 00:15:43.670
So if she did know more about the time and sherd case,

300
00:15:44.180 --> 00:15:46.010
while she took those secrets to a grave,

301
00:15:46.220 --> 00:15:49.370
but what about a date surely with modern technology and forensics,

302
00:15:49.371 --> 00:15:53.420
new leads could be found while there have been a few new developments where the

303
00:15:53.660 --> 00:15:56.030
have mentioned the first one was in 2011,

304
00:15:56.031 --> 00:15:59.720
when an Adelaide woman believed she had identified the summer to madness British

305
00:15:59.721 --> 00:16:03.050
sailor, HC Reynolds among her father's old possessions.

306
00:16:03.051 --> 00:16:07.010
She found the ID account of a man identified as Reynolds who served in world war

307
00:16:07.011 --> 00:16:09.590
one and bore a striking similarity to the summit.

308
00:16:09.590 --> 00:16:11.420
A man will be as 30 years younger,

309
00:16:11.510 --> 00:16:15.230
she took the photograph to a biological anthropologists to compare the image

310
00:16:15.380 --> 00:16:19.450
photos of the summer to man and computers that the shape was very similar and

311
00:16:19.760 --> 00:16:22.640
also found a mole, which was in the same location on both men,

312
00:16:22.760 --> 00:16:24.500
others disagree with this identification,

313
00:16:24.530 --> 00:16:28.280
claiming that they pieced together the life of a sailor from available records

314
00:16:28.281 --> 00:16:30.860
and that the real Reynolds died in 1953.

315
00:16:31.280 --> 00:16:34.550
Another private investigation is being led by professor Derek Abbott from the

316
00:16:34.551 --> 00:16:37.700
university of Adelaide who has been researching the summit of man for over a

317
00:16:37.701 --> 00:16:40.850
decade Abbott and his team have approached the case from two angles.

318
00:16:40.880 --> 00:16:45.230
One involves cracking the code and the other using DNA to identify the body.

319
00:16:45.260 --> 00:16:46.910
The first isn't going so well,

320
00:16:46.940 --> 00:16:49.580
the team has managed to eliminate numerous types of ciphers,

321
00:16:49.610 --> 00:16:53.570
but the most likely scenario is that the code needs the original 1859 poetry

322
00:16:53.571 --> 00:16:55.670
book to work, which has since been lost.

323
00:16:55.670 --> 00:16:58.190
And they have been unable to secure another copy.

324
00:16:58.280 --> 00:17:00.350
The DNA is showing more promise for years,

325
00:17:00.590 --> 00:17:03.770
Abbott has been unsuccessful in his efforts to convince the South Australian

326
00:17:03.771 --> 00:17:05.960
government to exhume the body of the summit to man,

327
00:17:05.961 --> 00:17:09.410
because he could improve eight significance and legitimate reason for us.

328
00:17:09.440 --> 00:17:11.510
This changed in October, 2017,

329
00:17:11.690 --> 00:17:16.670
when he received a few has from the plastic cost made of the to man decades ago

330
00:17:16.671 --> 00:17:20.810
and was able to analyze mitochondrial DNA from that sample Abbott's latest

00:17:34.910 --> 00:17:37.370
and solve the mystery of the summit of man.
