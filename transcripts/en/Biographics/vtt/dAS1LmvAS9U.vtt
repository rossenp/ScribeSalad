Tryon more on them in a bit.

5
00:00:21.140 --> 00:00:25.350
Today's protagonist is generally similar Francisco Franco who ruled Spain from

6
00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:27.310
1939 to 1975,

7
00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:31.270
with the title of K leading the longest running dictatorship in Europe,

8
00:00:31.450 --> 00:00:34.190
he is best remembered as the leader of the nationalist faction,

9
00:00:34.191 --> 00:00:35.390
the military insurgency,

10
00:00:35.391 --> 00:00:38.630
which opposed the Republican government in the Spanish civil war.

11
00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:42.340
But how did he rise through the ranks and seize control of a movement that he

12
00:00:42.341 --> 00:00:45.500
had not initiated? How did he rule Spain after the war?

13
00:00:45.720 --> 00:00:48.940
And how did he orchestrate the transition back to monarchy?

14
00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:52.900
What we're going to cover these and other aspects of Franco's life in today's

15
00:00:52.901 --> 00:00:56.180
episode of biographics. But before we get started a disclaimer,

16
00:00:56.280 --> 00:01:00.460
an extensive account of Francisco Franco's life implies telling the history of a

17
00:01:00.461 --> 00:01:04.010
complex conflict, a whole nation for more than 40 years.

18
00:01:04.310 --> 00:01:06.690
So we are going to skip some chunks in today's video.

19
00:01:06.870 --> 00:01:08.850
If you think we've missed an important event,

20
00:01:08.851 --> 00:01:12.530
please do post your suggestion in the comment below and make sure that you name

21
00:01:12.531 --> 00:01:15.090
the protagonists or protagonists of these events.

22
00:01:15.430 --> 00:01:17.490
And we might consider them for future videos.

23
00:01:23.910 --> 00:01:27.800
Francisco Franco Bahaman was born on the 4th of December,

24
00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:30.240
1892 in the town of Ferrell in Northwestern, Spain.

25
00:01:30.380 --> 00:01:34.240
He had two brothers and one sister born into a family that were generations had

26
00:01:34.400 --> 00:01:36.720
served the one's glorious Spanish Navy sister.

27
00:01:37.160 --> 00:01:40.160
Pilar described him as very quiet and into serious boy, physically,

28
00:01:40.161 --> 00:01:43.110
very thin in, in his childhood Francisco to a obsessions,

29
00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:46.550
his studies and his mother with whom he had a very tight relationship.

30
00:01:46.620 --> 00:01:51.470
Francisco's mother Maria de was an Austria and devout woman who imbued Francisco

31
00:01:51.540 --> 00:01:52.990
with a deep faith in religion.

32
00:01:53.290 --> 00:01:56.590
And in the importance of the church in Spanish society,

33
00:01:56.770 --> 00:02:01.590
his father was more interested in alcohol and extramarital affairs lifestyle,

34
00:02:01.591 --> 00:02:03.580
which Franco perceived as bodged.

35
00:02:03.581 --> 00:02:06.780
And he actively avoided throughout his life in 1898,

36
00:02:06.781 --> 00:02:10.700
the once mighty Spanish empire was reduced to a handful of colonies following

37
00:02:10.701 --> 00:02:15.300
the defeat in the Hispanic American war, which cost them Cuba, Puerto Rico,

38
00:02:15.480 --> 00:02:16.313
and the Philippines,

39
00:02:16.480 --> 00:02:20.660
the remnants of the defeated Spanish fleet returned to Ferrell marking a period

40
00:02:20.800 --> 00:02:24.010
of mourn for the whole community. And especially for the sick year old,

41
00:02:24.120 --> 00:02:27.770
this may have instilled in him a desire to restore the glory of the empire.

42
00:02:28.070 --> 00:02:31.530
The other effect of the destruction of the fleet was a decline in available

43
00:02:31.620 --> 00:02:33.970
spots for the Naval academy. For several years,

44
00:02:34.230 --> 00:02:37.250
the Navy would've been Francisco's natural destination,

45
00:02:37.310 --> 00:02:40.570
but he had to settle for an army career. Instead in 1906,

46
00:02:40.810 --> 00:02:43.730
aged 14 Francisco enlisted in the Toledo army academy.

47
00:02:44.010 --> 00:02:46.040
The new cadet was so small, his voice.

48
00:02:46.140 --> 00:02:49.440
So shrill that he quickly became victim of the AC Academy's bullies.

49
00:02:49.580 --> 00:02:53.840
His frame was so frail that the instructors had to modify his training rifle to

50
00:02:53.841 --> 00:02:57.200
make it lighter, to carry Francisco made up for his physical shortcomings,

51
00:02:57.201 --> 00:02:59.120
with determination and hard work.

52
00:02:59.440 --> 00:03:02.160
Although he did not display particular leadership qualities.

53
00:03:02.340 --> 00:03:03.880
He graduated in 1910,

54
00:03:03.881 --> 00:03:08.800
modestly placed 251 out of 312 cadets. The Spanish military.

55
00:03:08.820 --> 00:03:12.520
It was saturated with officers at that time and opportunities for career

56
00:03:12.760 --> 00:03:14.480
progression were scar in 1912.

57
00:03:14.710 --> 00:03:18.280
Francisco took the calculated move of volunteering for a post in Spanish,

58
00:03:18.990 --> 00:03:22.550
Morocco. The last colony in the hopes of progressing through the Army's ranks,

59
00:03:22.650 --> 00:03:26.630
his experiences in Africa would be key to shaping his later life.

60
00:03:26.650 --> 00:03:30.670
He later declared without Africa. I could not explain who I am.

61
00:03:36.930 --> 00:03:40.700
The kingdom of Spain was engaged in a brutal colonial war against the rebel

62
00:03:40.760 --> 00:03:43.220
tribes of the R mountain range in this conflict,

63
00:03:43.780 --> 00:03:48.420
lefthand and Franco displayed qualities so far kept hidden tenacity and physical

64
00:03:48.421 --> 00:03:49.254
courage.

65
00:03:49.380 --> 00:03:52.860
Lefthand and Franco was in charge of a company of Moroccan colonial troops that

66
00:03:52.861 --> 00:03:54.140
were loyal to the Spanish crown.

67
00:03:54.360 --> 00:03:58.860
He was able to maintain a ruthless discipline amongst his soldiers even went

68
00:03:58.861 --> 00:04:00.890
under heavy. He fire on one occasion.

69
00:04:00.990 --> 00:04:04.170
One of his troops refused to eat his rations and threw them at another.

70
00:04:04.171 --> 00:04:07.410
Officer Franco had been executed by firing squad.

71
00:04:07.590 --> 00:04:12.010
It is alleged that he applied this ruthlessness also against civilians using

72
00:04:12.011 --> 00:04:15.770
terror tactics to que the rebellion, the officers of the Spanish army in Africa.

73
00:04:15.870 --> 00:04:18.210
At that time when nicknames Navia, Dylan wor,

74
00:04:18.340 --> 00:04:22.640
which can be translated as the grooms or boyfriends of lady death.

75
00:04:22.750 --> 00:04:26.040
This was because of the high casualty rates amongst their wrecks.

76
00:04:26.220 --> 00:04:28.680
Franco apparently disregarded the fear of death.

77
00:04:28.730 --> 00:04:33.120
Often leading from the fronts with almost suicidal attacks against entrenched

78
00:04:33.180 --> 00:04:34.680
rebels in 1917,

79
00:04:34.700 --> 00:04:38.120
Franco had already been promoted to major and was ordered back to Spain to break

80
00:04:38.160 --> 00:04:42.350
a strike of coal miners in the Northern region notorious during a Stan,

81
00:04:42.910 --> 00:04:45.990
ofdo the capital of the region. He got engaged with common polo.

82
00:04:46.140 --> 00:04:50.230
This was despite opposition from her family of wealthy merchants back to Morocco

83
00:04:50.330 --> 00:04:52.390
in 1918. On the 28th of June,

84
00:04:52.750 --> 00:04:56.630
he was shot in the stomach and almost certain appointment with lady death while

85
00:04:56.790 --> 00:04:58.910
bleeding out on a stretcher. He called out to a doctor,

86
00:04:59.270 --> 00:05:01.700
but he was refused treatment a to the doctor.

87
00:05:01.920 --> 00:05:05.660
It would've been futile Franco then grabbed a rifle and pointed it to the

88
00:05:05.661 --> 00:05:08.020
doctor, threatening to shoot him. If he was not treated,

89
00:05:08.120 --> 00:05:12.220
the medic changed his mind and had him evacuated to a field hospital against all

90
00:05:12.250 --> 00:05:15.860
odds. He fully recovered. The native troops, followed him with blinds loyalty.

91
00:05:15.910 --> 00:05:20.540
After that in October of 1920 Franco was second in commands of the Terio to

92
00:05:20.780 --> 00:05:25.730
extranas the Spanish foreign Legion recently founded by L Colonel Milan

93
00:05:26.330 --> 00:05:26.810
astray.

94
00:05:26.810 --> 00:05:30.850
Milan introduced as such the credo of the CEO death in combat is the greatest

95
00:05:30.851 --> 00:05:31.390
honor.

96
00:05:31.390 --> 00:05:36.170
You die only once death arrives without pain and is not so terrible as it seems,

97
00:05:36.390 --> 00:05:39.210
the most horrible thing is to live as a coward.

98
00:05:39.550 --> 00:05:43.560
The Terio became known for its effectiveness, courage and brutality.

99
00:05:43.960 --> 00:05:47.840
One of Franco soldiers described as such their operations. When it attacked.

100
00:05:48.040 --> 00:05:51.240
The Teo knew no limits to its vengeance when its left a village,

101
00:05:51.270 --> 00:05:55.040
nothing remains but fires. And the corpses of men, women,

102
00:05:55.460 --> 00:05:57.440
and children in 1923,

103
00:05:57.441 --> 00:06:00.840
Franco became commander of the Terio shining for his strategic and

104
00:06:00.841 --> 00:06:03.080
administrative ability. On the 23rd of October,

105
00:06:03.140 --> 00:06:07.240
he married Carmen in ado with a representative of king Alfonso,

106
00:06:07.241 --> 00:06:08.640
the 13th present at the wedding.

107
00:06:08.910 --> 00:06:12.120
They would have only one daughter car seater born the following year.

108
00:06:12.450 --> 00:06:14.480
After 14 years of service in Morocco,

109
00:06:14.481 --> 00:06:18.550
the ones mediocre left tenant at pro so quickly that he returned to Spain,

110
00:06:18.590 --> 00:06:20.670
a Brigadier general age 33.

111
00:06:20.671 --> 00:06:24.030
He was the youngest general in Europe since Napoleon. Hello.

112
00:06:24.130 --> 00:06:27.350
He had also become something of a celebrity frequenting elite circles,

113
00:06:27.510 --> 00:06:31.430
and even starring as himself in the movie laal Kasad of 1926.

114
00:06:31.540 --> 00:06:34.030
This curious film dealing with a real life divorce case,

115
00:06:34.031 --> 00:06:37.540
featured many intellectuals politicians and military leaders of the time

116
00:06:37.740 --> 00:06:41.980
starring alongside Franco can also be seen old commander Milan astray who had

117
00:06:41.981 --> 00:06:45.860
later become nationalist propaganda chief during the civil war and even Miguel

118
00:06:46.340 --> 00:06:50.380
Premo de Rivera, who is ruling Spain as a military dictator from 1923,

119
00:06:50.530 --> 00:06:53.020
with the blessing of the king Franco celebrity status.

120
00:06:53.200 --> 00:06:57.300
And Carmen's connections gave them access to the most elite in Spain,

121
00:06:57.770 --> 00:06:59.650
but he did not enjoy their pleasures.

122
00:06:59.750 --> 00:07:03.490
He preferred to relish the traditional and dote values that he had learned from

123
00:07:03.491 --> 00:07:04.020
his mother,

124
00:07:04.020 --> 00:07:07.890
which he imparted to his cadets at the military academy and Zaragoza.

125
00:07:07.990 --> 00:07:10.810
But despite his best efforts for a return to tradition,

126
00:07:10.811 --> 00:07:13.530
Spanish society was changing around the young general

127
00:07:20.910 --> 00:07:24.720
From the bottom up Spanish society was shaken by the rise of leftist movement,

128
00:07:24.920 --> 00:07:27.280
supposing the traditional pillars of the monarchy,

129
00:07:27.460 --> 00:07:32.360
the Catholic church and the owners of larger states at the top prima Rivera's

130
00:07:32.361 --> 00:07:32.881
dictatorship.

131
00:07:32.881 --> 00:07:36.600
It was failing due to his ill-conceived economic policies resulting in high

132
00:07:36.640 --> 00:07:40.310
taxation, unsustainable public debt and rising inflation.

133
00:07:40.530 --> 00:07:43.990
He was forced to resign in January of 1930 in 1931,

134
00:07:44.060 --> 00:07:46.590
Alfonso the 13th agreed to democratic elections,

135
00:07:46.591 --> 00:07:49.790
which saw the victory of the left in April, the king abdicated,

136
00:07:50.050 --> 00:07:53.870
the Spanish Republic, it was founded and a new constitution was ratified.

137
00:07:53.900 --> 00:07:55.270
According to Franco's niece.

138
00:07:55.340 --> 00:08:00.340
This was a personal catastrophe for him as he did not believe in de nor in a

139
00:08:00.341 --> 00:08:03.420
multi-part system, but the new government was a fragile one.

140
00:08:03.421 --> 00:08:05.100
And in November of 1933,

141
00:08:05.101 --> 00:08:09.580
it was replaced by a conservative coalition who appointed general Franco as

142
00:08:09.581 --> 00:08:10.860
commander inchi of the army.

143
00:08:11.080 --> 00:08:14.100
The left continued to call civil unrest though in 1934,

144
00:08:14.500 --> 00:08:17.100
another massive strike of coal miners in Astoria took place.

145
00:08:17.320 --> 00:08:19.810
Franco was tasked with restoring order in the area.

146
00:08:19.950 --> 00:08:22.490
He commanded the Terio to take charge of the strikers.

147
00:08:22.790 --> 00:08:26.810
2000 protestors were killed or wounded, many more deported to Morocco,

148
00:08:26.830 --> 00:08:29.690
but his actions had the unintended consequence of rallying.

149
00:08:29.691 --> 00:08:33.250
The left-wing parties into a strong coalition called the people's front.

150
00:08:33.550 --> 00:08:36.810
In February of 1936, new elections were convened this time.

151
00:08:36.811 --> 00:08:40.880
It was the leftist people's front who secured a victory. The new insured,

152
00:08:41.080 --> 00:08:43.600
the conservative generals were not close to the seat of power.

153
00:08:43.940 --> 00:08:46.760
Franco was dispatched to 10 reef in the Canary islands,

154
00:08:46.761 --> 00:08:48.520
2000 kilometers from Madrid.

155
00:08:48.660 --> 00:08:52.480
The government kept close tabs on him by wire tapping his phone and checking his

156
00:08:52.481 --> 00:08:53.640
mail. In the meantime,

157
00:08:53.860 --> 00:08:56.880
unrest and violence were spiraling outta control in the country.

158
00:08:57.100 --> 00:09:00.280
The supporters of the leftist government soon gave way to excesses,

159
00:09:00.290 --> 00:09:02.480
especially against Catholic institutions,

160
00:09:02.920 --> 00:09:05.840
churches were being burned and priests were murdered behind the scenes.

161
00:09:05.920 --> 00:09:09.640
A group of generals was plotting a military coup Franco did not get involved at

162
00:09:09.641 --> 00:09:12.000
this stage. Coldly calculating the risks involved,

163
00:09:12.220 --> 00:09:16.350
the leaders of the plot were two generals, a and Moola Mola.

164
00:09:16.410 --> 00:09:21.310
The chief planner of the coup had a scheme to involve Franco in the Bando NA or

165
00:09:21.670 --> 00:09:22.503
nationalist forces.

166
00:09:22.610 --> 00:09:26.150
The plan involved dispatching a plane from London to the canaries to then

167
00:09:26.180 --> 00:09:30.790
smuggle Franco into Morocco, where he would lead the Terio to join the action.

168
00:09:30.880 --> 00:09:33.670
While the plane was flying Toran Canaria on the 11th of July,

169
00:09:33.690 --> 00:09:37.660
Franco sent an encrypted myth to refusing, to participate in the coup,

170
00:09:37.960 --> 00:09:42.500
but on the 13th right wing politician Calello was murdered by the Republican

171
00:09:42.600 --> 00:09:43.030
police,

172
00:09:43.030 --> 00:09:47.620
which gave to the insurgents the motivation to proceed with their plans at all

173
00:09:47.621 --> 00:09:51.900
costs Franco. He was finally convinced on July the 19th of 1936.

174
00:09:51.901 --> 00:09:54.660
He traveled in civilian disguised to the Moroccan colony,

175
00:09:54.840 --> 00:09:58.810
the African R numbering 30,000 swore loyalty to Franco into his course,

176
00:09:59.150 --> 00:10:03.290
but how could he ferry such an army all the way to Spain when the Navy was loyal

177
00:10:03.350 --> 00:10:06.650
to the Republic and was patrolling the straits of Gibralter.

178
00:10:06.760 --> 00:10:10.530
This is when he secured help from fascist Italy and Nazi Germany,

179
00:10:10.870 --> 00:10:14.530
the Italian and Germany air forces came to help Franco by organizing 800

180
00:10:14.531 --> 00:10:17.600
flights, they managed to ferry forces to mainland Spain.

181
00:10:17.900 --> 00:10:21.200
The hopes of the insurgents for a quick resolution of the co did not

182
00:10:21.400 --> 00:10:25.000
materialize. What had just started was the long and bloody conflict.

183
00:10:25.300 --> 00:10:28.160
The Spanish civil war, the insurgents also had a leadership problem.

184
00:10:28.170 --> 00:10:32.360
Their commander general Sani had died in a plane crash on the 20th of July.

185
00:10:32.500 --> 00:10:36.360
The ING replaced by the military hunter only formally led by the elder general

186
00:10:36.790 --> 00:10:37.950
have an as in the meanwhile,

187
00:10:38.050 --> 00:10:42.150
Franco had reached civilian and quickly bled his army Northwood facing only the

188
00:10:42.151 --> 00:10:43.390
resistance of civilians.

189
00:10:43.490 --> 00:10:46.470
His African army soon reached about Yas near the Portuguese border.

190
00:10:46.600 --> 00:10:50.310
After reaching the city Franco embarked in a political cleansing of the area as

191
00:10:50.311 --> 00:10:52.590
witnessed by Portuguese journalists, Marion Neves,

192
00:10:52.591 --> 00:10:56.950
hundreds of prisoners were rounded up in the local bull fighting ring and execut

193
00:10:57.080 --> 00:11:00.260
by firing squad. Franco continued his March towards Madrid,

194
00:11:00.261 --> 00:11:04.380
but in September he ordered a diversion to Toledo south of the capital in

195
00:11:04.381 --> 00:11:04.741
Toledo,

196
00:11:04.741 --> 00:11:09.300
a small Garrison of nationalists was besieged by the Republican army inside the

197
00:11:09.820 --> 00:11:10.540
ALZA that the castle,

198
00:11:10.540 --> 00:11:13.780
which housed the very military academy in which young Francisco had graduated

199
00:11:13.781 --> 00:11:17.060
Franco's army defeated the Republicans, but he only joins them.

200
00:11:17.061 --> 00:11:20.890
The following day, the 27th of September in full view of the news cameras,

201
00:11:21.150 --> 00:11:25.170
he had realized that this was more of a PR event than a simple military victory

202
00:11:25.850 --> 00:11:28.010
tanto was not only home to the military academy.

203
00:11:28.230 --> 00:11:32.170
It was also the religious capital of Spain by appearing as the liberator of

204
00:11:32.171 --> 00:11:35.730
Toledo, Franco had portrayed himself as the defender of Spanish,

205
00:11:35.760 --> 00:11:37.210
traditional institutions,

206
00:11:37.510 --> 00:11:41.600
one tradit institution that you don't want to defend is the prices at boutique.

207
00:11:41.880 --> 00:11:43.760
I wear shops, not a great thing,

208
00:11:43.780 --> 00:11:47.960
but that was a great transition into today's sponsor Warby Parker,

209
00:11:48.060 --> 00:11:50.920
who I want to tell you a bit about right now. In fact,

210
00:11:51.120 --> 00:11:55.880
I actually want your input because I just got my box a free Tryon from

211
00:11:56.200 --> 00:11:59.560
Warby Parker. I got five pairs of glasses to try on for five days.

212
00:11:59.561 --> 00:12:02.240
Obviously they're not to my prescription yet,

213
00:12:02.340 --> 00:12:05.760
but I'm gonna rotate them through this ad. And I would love your feedback.

214
00:12:05.960 --> 00:12:10.520
I will probably take it to heart, use the comments below. Okay. So pair one,

215
00:12:10.550 --> 00:12:13.750
what you do is you go online and you take a quick quiz and you get some

216
00:12:13.751 --> 00:12:17.430
recommendations to your face and your style pair.

217
00:12:17.450 --> 00:12:21.310
Two glasses start such as $95, including prescription lenses,

218
00:12:21.311 --> 00:12:23.190
which is a super competitive price.

219
00:12:23.330 --> 00:12:27.830
And you also get all the good stuff like anti GLA and anti scratch pair three.

220
00:12:27.890 --> 00:12:30.790
You can even try them on virtually before you get the box.

221
00:12:30.850 --> 00:12:34.420
If you got an iPhone 10, so that it's handy, pair four,

222
00:12:34.480 --> 00:12:38.020
all of these glasses that I'm trying on today, they look and feel great.

223
00:12:38.320 --> 00:12:41.620
You know, I'm not a style expert. So let me know what you think below,

224
00:12:41.640 --> 00:12:45.580
but you can tell that these are great glasses of worn glasses for a very long

225
00:12:45.581 --> 00:12:48.260
time. Finally pair five, but yes,

226
00:12:48.860 --> 00:12:52.580
Warby Parker order five pairs of glasses and try them on for five days,

227
00:12:52.760 --> 00:12:56.370
no obligation to buy. If you don't want to ships free,

228
00:12:56.440 --> 00:13:01.090
just head to Warby parker.com/biographics in order to try your free

229
00:13:01.240 --> 00:13:04.090
home. Try on let's get back to today's video.

230
00:13:10.350 --> 00:13:13.610
On the same evening, Francisco traveled to the city of Casares here,

231
00:13:13.611 --> 00:13:15.320
general Mullan astray in general,

232
00:13:15.960 --> 00:13:19.680
Yago announced that now the whole nationalist army was under the so command of

233
00:13:19.681 --> 00:13:21.000
general Franco. So far,

234
00:13:21.001 --> 00:13:24.840
Francisco had been leading only the African army in the south while general

235
00:13:25.320 --> 00:13:27.520
Mullo was in command in the north. All of the generals,

236
00:13:27.521 --> 00:13:31.280
except for the odd Cabernets thought that a unified leadership would improve

237
00:13:31.281 --> 00:13:33.600
their war efforts. Franco was one of the candidates,

238
00:13:33.601 --> 00:13:35.950
but it was not sure about taking the mantle.

239
00:13:36.350 --> 00:13:39.510
It was thanks to the scheming of his own brother asked that he eventually

240
00:13:39.511 --> 00:13:44.470
accepted Nicholas first pressured yawe into convincing Francisco to lead all

241
00:13:44.471 --> 00:13:48.030
armies. Yawe issued a vague threat to Franco. If he didn't accept the role,

242
00:13:48.090 --> 00:13:49.950
the hunter would appoint somebody else.

243
00:13:50.670 --> 00:13:53.470
Cola also orchestrated a meeting of eight leading generals,

244
00:13:53.471 --> 00:13:57.660
including Franco in Sal on the 28th of September, 1936.

245
00:13:57.800 --> 00:14:01.300
The purpose of the meeting was to decide whether to concentrate on one single

246
00:14:01.301 --> 00:14:01.810
person,

247
00:14:01.810 --> 00:14:05.500
both military and political leadership of the Spanish state during the civil

248
00:14:05.560 --> 00:14:07.140
war, except for two generals.

249
00:14:07.141 --> 00:14:10.540
Everybody voted for Franco to be the leader of the Spanish state term,

250
00:14:10.541 --> 00:14:14.740
which indicated the nationalist control territory Franco now had become the

251
00:14:14.741 --> 00:14:17.970
generally Sumo of all armed forces and head of the government.

252
00:14:18.150 --> 00:14:22.290
He took on the title of cord and ancient style for leader. In theory,

253
00:14:22.310 --> 00:14:24.450
he only had a mandate for the duration of the war,

254
00:14:24.690 --> 00:14:26.330
but Nicholas cleverly redacted,

255
00:14:26.331 --> 00:14:29.930
the official bulletin bearing this decision so that this time limitation was

256
00:14:29.931 --> 00:14:32.810
omitted. The Franco brothers had outsmarted the other generals,

257
00:14:32.960 --> 00:14:34.090
real co within a co,

258
00:14:34.091 --> 00:14:38.760
which ensured total power a life to the once reluctant insurgent

259
00:14:45.100 --> 00:14:49.640
By October of 1936 nationalist forces were in control of roughly one third of

260
00:14:49.641 --> 00:14:53.560
Spanish territory, mainly in the west and north of the country. But Madrid,

261
00:14:53.660 --> 00:14:58.120
it was still outta Franco's reach despite intensive air and artillery bombings.

262
00:14:58.340 --> 00:15:01.360
At this time, the Republican government secured support from Stalin.

263
00:15:01.460 --> 00:15:04.880
Now every side of the conflict could rely on help from powerful dictatorships.

264
00:15:05.070 --> 00:15:06.840
This war would not spare civilians.

265
00:15:06.930 --> 00:15:10.910
There was a total war in which many of the horrific tactics of world war two

266
00:15:10.911 --> 00:15:15.150
would be tested. Atrocities were perpetrated on a massive scale on both sides,

267
00:15:15.450 --> 00:15:19.030
Franco and the other generals enacted a policy of purging captured cities.

268
00:15:19.031 --> 00:15:21.110
Following the example of bad OS,

269
00:15:21.111 --> 00:15:24.190
the Gans were also active in executing members of the clergy,

270
00:15:24.430 --> 00:15:26.470
national prisoners, nationalists sympathizers,

271
00:15:26.490 --> 00:15:30.870
and even themselves as a result of inviting among disparate factions.

272
00:15:31.020 --> 00:15:34.540
Most notably in Kaun, it is estimated that by the end of the war,

273
00:15:34.720 --> 00:15:39.620
the nationalists had executed 75,000 people compared to 55,000 murdered

274
00:15:39.621 --> 00:15:41.860
by the Republicans in February, 1937,

275
00:15:41.880 --> 00:15:46.740
Franco attempted to take Madrid by frontal assault in the battle of Iran river,

276
00:15:47.040 --> 00:15:50.660
but he was starved by the international brigades of foreign volunteers.

277
00:15:51.040 --> 00:15:55.770
It is resting to note that 5,000 Germans and 3000 Italians fought against Franco

278
00:15:55.771 --> 00:15:58.450
joining the international brigades in support of the Republic.

279
00:15:58.540 --> 00:16:02.050
These brigades were 60,000 strong at their peak in March.

280
00:16:02.150 --> 00:16:05.970
Franco approached the capital from the Northeast capturing Guha first,

281
00:16:06.330 --> 00:16:09.770
then Italian court took the city and then moved quickly to Madrids,

282
00:16:09.771 --> 00:16:13.200
but were repelled by a Republican and via tank counter attack.

283
00:16:13.201 --> 00:16:17.160
Operations progressed for the nationalists in the north, in August, 1937.

284
00:16:17.161 --> 00:16:20.920
They captured the Northern stronghold of Santa and dare with help from Italian,

285
00:16:20.921 --> 00:16:22.800
regular army and black shirts.

286
00:16:23.070 --> 00:16:26.400
This helped consolidate their territories in the north. In the meantime,

287
00:16:26.460 --> 00:16:29.720
the German condo Legion and the fascist air force had been perpetrating.

288
00:16:29.820 --> 00:16:33.950
The first large carpet bombings of civilian targets over iRANO Barcelona,

289
00:16:34.090 --> 00:16:38.670
Madrid, and most notably GU on the 26th of April, 1937.

290
00:16:38.930 --> 00:16:43.550
But all in all despite decisive support from his allies Franco's progress was

291
00:16:43.580 --> 00:16:46.870
slow. German leadership was frustrated by this and suspected.

292
00:16:46.871 --> 00:16:48.830
It was a calculated move on his side.

293
00:16:49.190 --> 00:16:52.910
Franco's strategy was to firmly consolidate his own political power before

294
00:16:53.460 --> 00:16:55.900
answering on new territories, the situation for the Republicans,

295
00:16:55.901 --> 00:16:59.300
it became dire in the second half of 1938 in July,

296
00:16:59.301 --> 00:17:03.660
they engaged the nationalists in a protracted battle on the river Ebro in the

297
00:17:03.661 --> 00:17:04.360
Northeast.

298
00:17:04.360 --> 00:17:09.060
It lasted 113 days and claims more than 13,000 casualties on both sides.

299
00:17:09.360 --> 00:17:12.580
The nationalists 600,000 strong could take the hit,

300
00:17:12.680 --> 00:17:16.490
but the Republican less so in September of 1938,

301
00:17:16.491 --> 00:17:20.770
the international brigades withdrew from Spain while mu sent even more aircraft

302
00:17:21.010 --> 00:17:23.890
and artillery Franco on the 26th of January, 1939,

303
00:17:24.570 --> 00:17:27.090
Barcelona fells and the nationalists, the president of the Republic,

304
00:17:27.570 --> 00:17:31.690
Manuel AZAYA fled to France on the 27th of February British prime minister,

305
00:17:31.691 --> 00:17:35.640
Neville Chamberlain was the first European democratic leader to recognize

306
00:17:35.680 --> 00:17:38.160
Franco's government as legitimate on the same day,

307
00:17:38.800 --> 00:17:43.040
AZAYA resigned in by the 1st of April, all Republican forces had capitulated.

308
00:17:43.310 --> 00:17:44.480
That was the end of the war.

309
00:17:44.670 --> 00:17:48.440
Half a million people had died 2% of the total Spanish population,

310
00:17:48.620 --> 00:17:51.760
but the death toll, wasn't gonna stop there as, so ruler,

311
00:17:51.761 --> 00:17:56.080
dictator or Cardillo of the Spanish state Francisco Franco could not tolerate

312
00:17:56.680 --> 00:17:57.640
dissent. After the war had ended.

313
00:17:57.740 --> 00:18:01.960
He continued his policy of purging his country of enemies of his regime via

314
00:18:01.970 --> 00:18:05.360
executions rules by military tribunals sources differ,

315
00:18:05.460 --> 00:18:10.310
but it is alleged that between 30,200 hundred thousand dissidents were executed

316
00:18:10.330 --> 00:18:11.350
by Franco's regime.

317
00:18:17.380 --> 00:18:19.430
Following the beginning of world war II in Europe,

318
00:18:19.670 --> 00:18:24.510
there was a debate as to whether Spain should join the access powers on the 23rd

319
00:18:24.510 --> 00:18:27.470
of October, 1940 Franco and Hitler met in Southern France,

320
00:18:27.850 --> 00:18:30.460
Franco owed much the Germans, but during that meeting,

321
00:18:30.480 --> 00:18:32.780
he did not commit to active participation in the war.

322
00:18:32.880 --> 00:18:36.740
The decision was considered a wise one and defended by Francoist supporters over

323
00:18:36.741 --> 00:18:37.280
time,

324
00:18:37.280 --> 00:18:41.260
the Spanish military and industrial capabilities had been exhausted by the civil

325
00:18:41.320 --> 00:18:44.780
war and they were not in shape for fighting another conflict. However,

326
00:18:44.980 --> 00:18:48.780
a member of V rip Andros staff interviewed by the BBC reported that there had

327
00:18:48.781 --> 00:18:50.890
been a previous meeting in Berlin ribbon.

328
00:18:51.250 --> 00:18:54.450
Trump had met with Franco's foreign affairs minister, Sorano sun,

329
00:18:54.710 --> 00:18:58.890
the minister proposed to join the axis in exchange for a large chunk of north

330
00:18:58.891 --> 00:19:02.290
African territory to rebuild the Spanish embar. But at that time,

331
00:19:02.291 --> 00:19:05.730
the Germans had not been impressed by the offer at that meeting in France.

332
00:19:05.740 --> 00:19:06.110
Again,

333
00:19:06.110 --> 00:19:09.210
Franco offered his participation in the war in exchange for all the French

334
00:19:09.360 --> 00:19:13.360
Morocco ger and to N look could not accept these demands.

335
00:19:13.361 --> 00:19:16.640
And the negotiations did not progress the fear he was furious.

336
00:19:16.950 --> 00:19:20.800
This is when he famously said that it'd rather have four teeth pulled out than

337
00:19:20.801 --> 00:19:23.000
another talk with Franco later in the war,

338
00:19:23.001 --> 00:19:27.440
Franco was astute enough to maintain an equidistant neutrality with both access

339
00:19:27.441 --> 00:19:30.000
and ally powers. For example, on the one hand,

340
00:19:30.001 --> 00:19:34.470
he allowed pilots downed over Spanish territory to rejoin their countries and he

341
00:19:34.471 --> 00:19:36.670
never made a move on Gibralter. On the other hand,

342
00:19:36.671 --> 00:19:38.390
he allowed Italian Navy frogman.

343
00:19:38.590 --> 00:19:42.190
He launched raids on Gibralter from Spanish ports by 1941,

344
00:19:42.250 --> 00:19:45.270
he was maintaining good trade relations with the us and the UK.

345
00:19:45.450 --> 00:19:46.283
But in that summer,

346
00:19:46.290 --> 00:19:50.710
he allowed a contingent of 47,000 volunteers to join operation Barbara Rosa,

347
00:19:50.870 --> 00:19:51.980
a against the Soviet union.

348
00:19:52.700 --> 00:19:57.460
This contingent known as led AUL law blue division was recalled in October of

349
00:19:57.620 --> 00:19:58.221
1943,

350
00:19:58.221 --> 00:20:01.540
when it was clear that the war on the Eastern front was a lost cause for the

351
00:20:01.820 --> 00:20:02.250
access powers.

352
00:20:02.250 --> 00:20:06.020
This marked Franco's opportunistic shift towards the allies and the latter part

353
00:20:06.021 --> 00:20:06.854
of the war

354
00:20:12.620 --> 00:20:16.050
After the war Franco came under considerable pressure to restore the monarchy.

355
00:20:16.070 --> 00:20:16.970
In 1947,

356
00:20:16.990 --> 00:20:21.050
Franco announced a referendum to let the Spanish people site the vote confirmed

357
00:20:21.090 --> 00:20:22.490
a preference for the monarchy. However,

358
00:20:22.590 --> 00:20:27.010
the ever astute Franco while accepting the decision declared himself as lifetime

359
00:20:27.011 --> 00:20:30.690
regions with the privilege of appointing a further regions or a new king before

360
00:20:30.691 --> 00:20:34.480
his death, following Alfonso, the 13th in 1941,

361
00:20:34.481 --> 00:20:36.600
the natural air to the throne was his third son,

362
00:20:36.660 --> 00:20:39.040
Don qu of BN count of Barcelona.

363
00:20:39.100 --> 00:20:42.520
Don Juan's older brothers had both renounced their right to the throne. Franco,

364
00:20:42.521 --> 00:20:45.400
however, was under pressure from two components of his power base,

365
00:20:45.500 --> 00:20:47.760
the Angus and the carless movements.

366
00:20:47.900 --> 00:20:52.320
The Angus were anti monarchic while the carists supported another branch of the

367
00:20:52.321 --> 00:20:56.560
bourbons Franko managed to placate both sides by selecting as future king.

368
00:20:56.620 --> 00:21:00.360
The son of Don Juan named Juan Carlos reluctantly,

369
00:21:00.380 --> 00:21:02.320
Don Juan agreed and did 1949,

370
00:21:02.380 --> 00:21:07.150
the 10 year old Juan Carlos traveled to Madrid to begin his studies and train as

371
00:21:07.151 --> 00:21:09.110
future Monarch, while planning for succession.

372
00:21:09.510 --> 00:21:12.510
Franco had to think about rebuilding his country, which was weakened by the war.

373
00:21:12.690 --> 00:21:14.430
And it was internationally isolated.

374
00:21:14.570 --> 00:21:17.590
The international community sought suspicion in his regime,

375
00:21:17.870 --> 00:21:21.070
remnants of fascist dictatorships from before the war. In fact,

376
00:21:21.071 --> 00:21:25.110
Franco's regime did offer sanctuary to many former fascists to Nazis prime

377
00:21:25.111 --> 00:21:30.060
example being SS commando OCO who managed a thriving business in

378
00:21:30.061 --> 00:21:30.894
Madrid,

379
00:21:31.140 --> 00:21:34.420
Franco embarked on a project to reconcile the opposing factions of the civil

380
00:21:34.520 --> 00:21:38.820
war. The valley of the fallen. This is a monumental shrine built over 20 years.

381
00:21:38.920 --> 00:21:43.020
Not far from Madrid. It is topped by a gigantic cross taller than the EAL tower.

382
00:21:43.200 --> 00:21:47.460
And it houses the remnants of 50,000 nationalists and Republican soldiers.

383
00:21:47.570 --> 00:21:51.370
Franco's intention was to commemorate the fall and heal the rift between enemies

384
00:21:51.430 --> 00:21:55.530
and lay a promise not to engage in further civil conflict. The intention,

385
00:21:55.750 --> 00:21:58.410
it was good. Although some sources claim that it was built,

386
00:21:58.411 --> 00:22:02.810
thanks to forced labor of Republican prisoners looking externally Franco sought

387
00:22:02.811 --> 00:22:06.330
to reestablish ties with the west has strong anti communism stands,

388
00:22:06.331 --> 00:22:09.800
made him especially popular with the United had states and they backed Spain's

389
00:22:09.801 --> 00:22:12.000
entry into the United nations. In 1950,

390
00:22:12.180 --> 00:22:15.160
the relationship with the us was cemented in 1953,

391
00:22:15.420 --> 00:22:19.360
Franco and president Eisenhower assigned an agreement that enabled the United

392
00:22:19.360 --> 00:22:22.480
States to establish four military bases in Spain in return,

393
00:22:22.650 --> 00:22:25.080
Spain was allowed to join NATO in the same year.

394
00:22:25.140 --> 00:22:27.200
Franco got recognition by the smallest,

395
00:22:27.300 --> 00:22:30.150
but by no means is powerless state in the world.

396
00:22:30.750 --> 00:22:32.270
The Vatican Pope pirates the 12th,

397
00:22:32.271 --> 00:22:36.030
granted Franco the right to appoint Spanish bishops from a list of several

398
00:22:36.031 --> 00:22:39.150
candidates proposed by the holy sea. In 1956,

399
00:22:39.220 --> 00:22:42.110
Morocco gained independence after being a French protectorate,

400
00:22:42.130 --> 00:22:45.710
the Moroccan government demanded authority over the city, Ify territory.

401
00:22:45.730 --> 00:22:49.340
One of the last remnants of Spanish possessions in north Africa,

402
00:22:49.760 --> 00:22:54.380
Franco denied this concession as ever willing to preserve at least a slice of

403
00:22:54.381 --> 00:22:58.220
the empire. Morocco reacted by creating a Moroccan liberation army,

404
00:22:58.221 --> 00:23:01.220
which engaged the Spanish Garrison in a series of skirmishes.

405
00:23:01.290 --> 00:23:04.700
It's all the general SMO ordered the intervention of paratroopers from the

406
00:23:04.701 --> 00:23:08.580
motherlands the warp known as the Spanish forgotten war dragged on into 1958

407
00:23:08.610 --> 00:23:12.770
with even the French army and air force. Joining Franco in February, by April,

408
00:23:12.771 --> 00:23:14.130
the Moroccans had been defeated,

409
00:23:14.310 --> 00:23:18.610
but Spain was pressured by the UN and the us to hands back the region of tough

410
00:23:18.930 --> 00:23:22.330
fire ban retained control of city, if until 1969,

411
00:23:22.331 --> 00:23:26.690
when it returns the former colony to Morocco following a UN resolution in 1963,

412
00:23:26.691 --> 00:23:31.360
Franco had launched a program to soften his totalitarian him in a bid to further

413
00:23:31.361 --> 00:23:34.520
improve relationships with the west. And in particular, the us,

414
00:23:34.740 --> 00:23:38.800
he terminated the activities of military tribunals and had been replaced with

415
00:23:38.960 --> 00:23:39.780
civilian courts.

416
00:23:39.780 --> 00:23:43.560
He also shut down these special courts created to trial communists and free

417
00:23:43.561 --> 00:23:45.520
masons. Other reforms included laws,

418
00:23:45.521 --> 00:23:49.840
supporting a partial freedom of the press and freedom of worship until then the

419
00:23:49.841 --> 00:23:54.000
regime meant actively suppressed the activities of all opposition left wing

420
00:23:54.001 --> 00:23:57.720
parties, trade unions, and regional separatists who were very vocal,

421
00:23:57.850 --> 00:24:01.720
especially in the bass country and Catalonia Franco's reforms.

422
00:24:01.720 --> 00:24:05.670
And over years to the west had succeeded in stabilizing country and the economy

423
00:24:05.671 --> 00:24:07.870
repression of dissenters. It was toned down,

424
00:24:07.871 --> 00:24:11.510
but the generally SEMO still maintained a tough stance against separatism.

425
00:24:11.690 --> 00:24:13.030
In August of 1965,

426
00:24:13.031 --> 00:24:16.230
president Johnson asked for Spain's participation in the Vietnam war.

427
00:24:16.290 --> 00:24:20.630
The Cillo rejected the invitation logically wary of engaging in gorilla warfare

428
00:24:20.850 --> 00:24:21.750
in a far away jungle,

429
00:24:22.050 --> 00:24:25.460
but he did order for a team of field medics to join the war. Meanwhile,

430
00:24:25.520 --> 00:24:27.540
Franco his advisor, Louis Carrera,

431
00:24:27.600 --> 00:24:31.020
Blanco and prince Juan Carlos were planning the succession.

432
00:24:31.120 --> 00:24:34.700
The plan was to formally reveal the bourbon prince as future king in January of

433
00:24:34.900 --> 00:24:38.940
1969. But this was delayed due to a series of terrorist attacks from the ETA,

434
00:24:39.240 --> 00:24:40.220
the Basque separatists.

435
00:24:40.290 --> 00:24:44.620
Finally in July Franco formally announced that Quan Carlos a BBO would succeed

436
00:24:44.621 --> 00:24:47.850
him as head of king of Spain and a televised ceremony.

437
00:24:47.950 --> 00:24:51.850
The prince swore an oath of loyalty to the Cordio and the nationalist movement

438
00:24:51.950 --> 00:24:52.970
by 1973,

439
00:24:53.110 --> 00:24:56.810
Franco was 81 and not able to handle the day-today administration of his

440
00:24:56.811 --> 00:24:57.350
government.

441
00:24:57.350 --> 00:25:01.130
He appointed Carrera Blago as prime minister maintaining an active role in some

442
00:25:01.131 --> 00:25:03.970
foreign policy matters. Carrera Blanco's office was short,

443
00:25:04.170 --> 00:25:05.210
lived on the 20th of December.

444
00:25:05.230 --> 00:25:09.600
His car was blown up by the ETA and an explosion so violent that the car flew

445
00:25:09.601 --> 00:25:12.520
over a church and landed on a second floor terrace.

446
00:25:12.620 --> 00:25:15.080
And a car joke started to circulate in Spain,

447
00:25:15.210 --> 00:25:18.520
which roughly translates to up with Spain up with Franco,

448
00:25:18.830 --> 00:25:21.160
even higher than Carrero Blanco.

449
00:25:21.300 --> 00:25:25.080
The subsequent crackdown on the ETA led to five terrorists being sentenced to

450
00:25:25.081 --> 00:25:27.790
death and executed in September member of 1975.

451
00:25:27.920 --> 00:25:31.830
These death penalties caused massive demonstrations in Madrid, Lisbon,

452
00:25:31.890 --> 00:25:35.790
and the BAS city of San Sabastian as well as international condemnation,

453
00:25:35.930 --> 00:25:39.870
Franco had firmly backed these ends, future executions, the dissent,

454
00:25:39.930 --> 00:25:41.590
the demonstrations, even the jokes.

455
00:25:41.850 --> 00:25:45.510
All these were clear signs that times had definitely changed since the

456
00:25:45.511 --> 00:25:48.940
totalitarian days of the 90 forties and fifties, the regime,

457
00:25:49.030 --> 00:25:52.180
regardless of the Cal DI's age, it was nearing its end,

458
00:25:58.570 --> 00:26:02.740
Generally SI Francisco Franco Baha Hyundai had been a reluctant leader who had

459
00:26:02.741 --> 00:26:04.940
gained control on the back of his brother's schemes.

460
00:26:05.080 --> 00:26:09.210
He had been nostalgic of the empire ready to who bargain his country's entry

461
00:26:09.211 --> 00:26:11.250
into world Wari to regain north Africa.

462
00:26:11.630 --> 00:26:16.330
He had been the ruthless Cordio who did not tolerate opposition. And finally,

463
00:26:16.630 --> 00:26:20.810
he had been the astute politician who had sought to bring stability to a divided

464
00:26:20.811 --> 00:26:23.610
nation. Francisco Franco died on the 20th of November,

465
00:26:23.930 --> 00:26:27.970
1975 of natural causes. His last words were reported as I,

466
00:26:28.160 --> 00:26:31.720
I ask pardon of all my enemies, as I pardon with all my heart,

467
00:26:32.100 --> 00:26:34.240
all those who declared themselves my enemy,

468
00:26:34.800 --> 00:26:39.200
although I did not consider them to be so in his last conversation with prime

469
00:26:39.320 --> 00:26:39.961
minister Navarro,

470
00:26:39.961 --> 00:26:43.120
he asked for the Spanish people to rally around their new king, won Carlos.

471
00:26:43.640 --> 00:26:45.960
And to keep the lands of Spain United,

472
00:26:46.300 --> 00:26:48.400
the Spanish did give their support to Juan Carlos,

473
00:26:48.500 --> 00:26:51.320
who successfully led the transition to a full democracy.

474
00:26:51.820 --> 00:26:55.920
I'm aware that Francisco Franco ends the civil war remain a divisive topic to

475
00:26:55.921 --> 00:26:57.920
this day in Spain. So before we end things today,

476
00:26:57.921 --> 00:27:01.320
I'll ask you to kindly not turn the comments section into a rhetoric battle.

477
00:27:01.780 --> 00:27:05.070
Why don't you use the comments instead to suggest another character from the

478
00:27:05.071 --> 00:27:08.390
civil war, maybe on the Republican side and that's it from me.
