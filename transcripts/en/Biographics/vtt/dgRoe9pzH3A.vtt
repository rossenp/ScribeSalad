bit.

7
00:00:18.190 --> 00:00:20.830
When we think of Sweden today, we think of them as a peaceful nation.

8
00:00:20.900 --> 00:00:22.430
They haven't been involved in a war,

9
00:00:22.490 --> 00:00:26.790
either external or internal for over 200 years, even longer than Switzerland.

10
00:00:26.860 --> 00:00:28.990
It's hard to believe when looking at modern Sweden,

11
00:00:29.100 --> 00:00:32.510
that this nation used to be the seat of a mighty empire possessing.

12
00:00:32.511 --> 00:00:34.150
One of the most advanced armies in Europe,

13
00:00:34.370 --> 00:00:37.710
Sweden in the 17th century was a country to be feared.

14
00:00:37.850 --> 00:00:41.780
The reason Sweden rose from small Scandinavian kingdom to might embark and be

15
00:00:41.781 --> 00:00:45.380
personified in the only king of Sweden to earn the avatar.

16
00:00:45.800 --> 00:00:49.940
The great Gustavos ALS was a teenager when he ascended to the throne of a

17
00:00:49.941 --> 00:00:52.820
country, embroiled in religious and diagnostic turmoil.

18
00:00:52.850 --> 00:00:54.300
Over the course of 20 years,

19
00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:58.420
I revolutionized the nation transforming the government from a medieval Relic to

20
00:00:58.421 --> 00:00:59.740
a more modern bureaucracy,

21
00:00:59.840 --> 00:01:02.890
but his most lasting contribute was in the field of warfare.

22
00:01:03.230 --> 00:01:07.890
He modernized the Swedish army and built it into a sledgehammer with Gustavos Al

23
00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:09.930
the first modern general at its head.

24
00:01:09.950 --> 00:01:14.010
He became known as the defender of Protestantism when he brought his army to

25
00:01:14.011 --> 00:01:16.410
continental Europe in the midst of the wars of religion,

26
00:01:16.970 --> 00:01:18.410
changing the course of history and the process

27
00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:29.720
Gustava was born on the 19th of December, 1594, the son of duke, Charles,

28
00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:31.760
the brother of king, John II of Sweden.

29
00:01:32.120 --> 00:01:36.680
John had died in 1592 leaving the throne to his son Siman who was already king

30
00:01:36.681 --> 00:01:37.440
of Poland.

31
00:01:37.440 --> 00:01:41.400
This caused friction because Siman was a devout Roman Catholic Sweden had been a

32
00:01:41.560 --> 00:01:44.190
majority Protestant come over 65 years by this point.

33
00:01:44.191 --> 00:01:47.750
And the ability was therefore that a Catholic king would suppress their religion

34
00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:49.190
as it happened elsewhere in Europe,

35
00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:53.270
Siman was interested in more than religious affairs of his new realm.

36
00:01:53.271 --> 00:01:56.430
<v 1>However, he wanted to fully integrate the separate kingdoms of Poland,</v>

37
00:01:56.540 --> 00:02:01.470
Lithuania and Sweden into one combined diagnostic kingdom centered on Warsaw

38
00:02:01.620 --> 00:02:03.380
duke Charles, the Kings Oland,

39
00:02:03.740 --> 00:02:07.900
devout Calvinist posed these moves and decided to act to assume the reigns of

40
00:02:07.901 --> 00:02:08.734
power for himself.

41
00:02:08.800 --> 00:02:13.100
The dispute flared into a civil war in 1598 and by 1600 Charles

42
00:02:13.630 --> 00:02:17.900
Atman packing back to Poland in disgrace, he was deposed as king of Sweden,

43
00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:22.220
and Charles was crowned as Charles the ninth making Gustavus ALS the new air.

44
00:02:22.280 --> 00:02:25.810
The throne Charles is were rain was marked by almost constant warfare with

45
00:02:26.010 --> 00:02:26.850
Denmark, with Russia,

46
00:02:27.160 --> 00:02:32.050
with Polands where Singerman viewed Charles as a USPA and spent years trying to

47
00:02:32.051 --> 00:02:35.450
regain his inheritance. Gustava Alph has inherited all of these conflicts.

48
00:02:35.451 --> 00:02:38.610
When his father died in 16, 11 age, only 17,

49
00:02:38.611 --> 00:02:42.810
the new king found himself opposed by three wealthier and more powerful nations

50
00:02:43.050 --> 00:02:46.000
that completely surrounded country. If Sweden was to survive,

51
00:02:46.360 --> 00:02:49.280
Gustavos needed to reform and modernize his army.

52
00:02:55.620 --> 00:02:59.000
<v 0>In the middle ages, the nations of Europe did not have standing armies.</v>

53
00:02:59.080 --> 00:03:01.640
They were considered too expensive in times of war.

54
00:03:01.740 --> 00:03:04.960
The bulk of the army was made up of conscripted peasants who were given little

55
00:03:05.240 --> 00:03:06.720
training. And we usually poorly arms.

56
00:03:07.020 --> 00:03:10.560
The only professional soldiers were the Knight wealthy members of the ability

57
00:03:10.580 --> 00:03:13.360
who could afford the expensive armor and arms needed.

58
00:03:13.580 --> 00:03:16.600
But warfare was changing the Dawn of the 17th century.

59
00:03:16.860 --> 00:03:20.910
The muskets was becoming an in part of infantry units rendering the night class

60
00:03:20.911 --> 00:03:23.350
obsolete a new military organization was needed.

61
00:03:23.460 --> 00:03:27.430
What the king came up with was an entirely new model of bureaucratic governance.

62
00:03:27.431 --> 00:03:31.630
Giving the church responsibility for maintaining a conscription registry from

63
00:03:31.631 --> 00:03:32.670
now on local church,

64
00:03:32.710 --> 00:03:35.310
parishes would be required to keep a roster of physically fit.

65
00:03:35.510 --> 00:03:37.430
Then between the ages of 16 and 60,

66
00:03:37.660 --> 00:03:39.780
that could be called for service were needed.

67
00:03:40.040 --> 00:03:42.980
Not only was this more efficient since everyone went to church and thus

68
00:03:43.500 --> 00:03:44.820
churchman knew their congregation well,

69
00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:48.180
but it also instilled a religious further into military service.

70
00:03:48.440 --> 00:03:50.940
Now volunteering in time of war was not a civic duty,

71
00:03:51.240 --> 00:03:53.940
but a responsibility for good Christians as well.

72
00:03:54.090 --> 00:03:57.660
This description registry was used to create a system where each Swedish

73
00:03:57.900 --> 00:04:00.970
province had the ability to raise a provincial regiment of soldiers.

74
00:04:01.120 --> 00:04:04.690
Four of these regimens were to be kept on active duty at all times within the

75
00:04:04.691 --> 00:04:07.610
Swedish Homeland and two in Swedish territory in Finland,

76
00:04:07.611 --> 00:04:11.530
giving the king a permanent standing army of around 20,000 men with the ability

77
00:04:11.550 --> 00:04:14.770
to call up the remaining regimens as reserves when needed training for the

78
00:04:14.771 --> 00:04:18.170
troops were standardized across the country and inactive reservists were

79
00:04:18.171 --> 00:04:20.960
required to keep their weapons in fighting edition. At all times,

80
00:04:21.960 --> 00:04:24.320
Gustavo's reforms went beyond military organization though.

81
00:04:24.320 --> 00:04:26.520
He also revolutionized the tactics of his army.

82
00:04:26.580 --> 00:04:30.200
He recognized the growing power of the musket and the cannon noting that they

83
00:04:30.201 --> 00:04:31.600
were great equalizing forces,

84
00:04:32.040 --> 00:04:34.840
a small army with superior fire power could defeat a large army.

85
00:04:34.940 --> 00:04:38.680
The Swedish army would invest heavily in artillery, but they ran into a problem.

86
00:04:38.681 --> 00:04:40.480
Typical for the period. Most,

87
00:04:40.750 --> 00:04:43.910
most cannon barrels were made out of either cast iron or bronze,

88
00:04:44.050 --> 00:04:45.510
and they were extremely heavy,

89
00:04:45.730 --> 00:04:48.150
too heavy to be easily moved around of battlefield.

90
00:04:48.470 --> 00:04:51.590
And Army's artillery was usually placed on a hill at the start of the battle and

91
00:04:51.591 --> 00:04:53.430
remains there for the entire engagement.

92
00:04:53.540 --> 00:04:57.070
This greatly limited their effectiveness. What the king wanted was lighter,

93
00:04:57.330 --> 00:05:01.540
mobile artillery pieces that could be more easily moved around the field battle

94
00:05:01.720 --> 00:05:03.140
to provide far support as needed.

95
00:05:03.210 --> 00:05:05.980
This would give his army a great advantage on the battlefield,

96
00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:08.780
but it required a completely new design in order to work.

97
00:05:08.890 --> 00:05:12.580
What the Swedish engineers originally came up with was the leather cannon.

98
00:05:12.740 --> 00:05:15.980
A barrel made out of a thin copper tube, surrounded by tightly wound,

99
00:05:16.050 --> 00:05:18.180
rope chords, and topped with leather.

100
00:05:18.330 --> 00:05:22.410
This weapon was lightweight only requiring two men to pull it round and operate

101
00:05:22.570 --> 00:05:23.211
it, but in practice,

102
00:05:23.211 --> 00:05:27.010
the weapons didn't last very long under fire before the barrels burst from the

103
00:05:27.011 --> 00:05:28.810
heat injuring or killing the gunner,

104
00:05:28.970 --> 00:05:33.090
a more practical design was produced essentially a miniature version of existing

105
00:05:33.091 --> 00:05:37.370
bronze cannons that could be towed either by a single horse or three men yet

106
00:05:37.371 --> 00:05:42.320
still provided a rate of fire 50% faster than the muskets of the peer period.

107
00:05:43.200 --> 00:05:47.440
Gustava Alfas now had his mobile fire support weapon and developed a new set of

108
00:05:47.441 --> 00:05:52.080
tactics to incorporate all the separate pieces of his army into one cohesive

109
00:05:52.230 --> 00:05:52.700
unit.

110
00:05:52.700 --> 00:05:56.600
The Swedish king is considered one of the first modern generals to utilize this

111
00:05:56.920 --> 00:06:01.600
combined arms style of warfare, which is still practiced even today.

112
00:06:01.900 --> 00:06:06.320
And the king would soon have a need for his new army because there was trouble

113
00:06:06.321 --> 00:06:07.121
brewing in Europe,

114
00:06:07.121 --> 00:06:11.720
trouble threatened to send the entire continent up in flames.

115
00:06:11.990 --> 00:06:15.760
Okay, so we've got a holy war brewing in Europe. Fantastic.

116
00:06:15.980 --> 00:06:18.110
And we'll get into that in just a moment,

117
00:06:18.210 --> 00:06:21.350

00:07:41.050 --> 00:07:42.510
And let's get back to the Swedes.

146
00:07:48.690 --> 00:07:52.110
In 1521, Martin Luther was excommunicated by Pope Leo,

147
00:07:52.170 --> 00:07:54.470
the 10th after refusing to renounce his writings,

148
00:07:54.471 --> 00:07:55.870
that condemned what Luther calls,

149
00:07:56.050 --> 00:08:00.940
the abuses and excesses of the cash church Luther's writings quickly

150
00:08:00.941 --> 00:08:01.900
spread across Europe.

151
00:08:01.901 --> 00:08:06.300
Thanks to the recently invented printing press and a permanent schism developed

152
00:08:06.301 --> 00:08:08.740
between Catholics and the new Protestant faith,

153
00:08:09.180 --> 00:08:12.460
religious belief mixed with politics as heads of states chose sides,

154
00:08:12.530 --> 00:08:13.363
England Sweden,

155
00:08:13.440 --> 00:08:17.020
and the Dutch public became majority Protestant countries while France, Spain,

156
00:08:17.080 --> 00:08:21.730
and the Italian states remains majority ethic where things got complicated was

157
00:08:21.731 --> 00:08:24.810
in the holy Roman, em empire of central Europe. The country,

158
00:08:24.910 --> 00:08:29.330
we now know as Germany existed in the 17th century as a loose Confederation of

159
00:08:29.331 --> 00:08:34.210
over 1,800 separate states and municipalities known as the holy Roman em empire,

160
00:08:34.300 --> 00:08:36.450
while each territory answered to the emperor,

161
00:08:36.480 --> 00:08:39.770
they also had a great deal of autonomy within their own borders.

162
00:08:40.080 --> 00:08:43.800
Protestant reformation started in the German states and it deeply divided an

163
00:08:43.801 --> 00:08:46.720
already divided country. After years of inter sine warfare,

164
00:08:46.940 --> 00:08:51.920
the piece of Augsburg signed in 1555 established the principle of curious Regio,

165
00:08:53.200 --> 00:08:57.400
religion whose realm their religion, which meant that whatever the religion,

166
00:08:57.460 --> 00:09:01.520
the ruler of particular territory followed would decide what that territory's

167
00:09:01.720 --> 00:09:03.160
official religion would be.

168
00:09:03.250 --> 00:09:07.160
There were problems with the system from the start diagnostic struggles became

169
00:09:07.190 --> 00:09:09.480
even more vicious as Catholic and Protestant,

170
00:09:09.800 --> 00:09:13.680
as for each other over the bright to rule it also encouraged rulers in Catholic

171
00:09:14.000 --> 00:09:14.790
territories,

172
00:09:14.790 --> 00:09:18.030
they and occupy Protestant ones and vice versa in order to convert the

173
00:09:18.031 --> 00:09:18.610
occupants.

174
00:09:18.610 --> 00:09:22.270
Things only got worse when Archduke Thurd and end of Austria became the air to

175
00:09:22.271 --> 00:09:23.790
the Habsburg family dynasty,

176
00:09:23.791 --> 00:09:27.710
making him the leading contender to be the next Tori emperor Thur and end was an

177
00:09:27.711 --> 00:09:28.750
extremely odd and Catholic.

178
00:09:28.970 --> 00:09:33.150
He once was quoted as saying he would rather his lands be destroyed than

179
00:09:33.590 --> 00:09:37.660
tolerate Hery for a all day tensions between Catholics and Protestants in

180
00:09:37.661 --> 00:09:40.420
Germany finally broke in 16, 18 in Bohemia,

181
00:09:40.500 --> 00:09:44.540
a meeting in PR castle between Protestant nobleman and Catholic representatives

182
00:09:44.541 --> 00:09:45.900
of third announced violence.

183
00:09:45.970 --> 00:09:48.660
When the Catholics were thrown out a third story window,

184
00:09:48.880 --> 00:09:50.020
all the men survived the fall,

185
00:09:50.021 --> 00:09:54.060
but what became known as the ESTs of Prague triggered civil war,

186
00:09:54.240 --> 00:09:56.290
or at least its star started off that way.

187
00:09:56.570 --> 00:09:59.090
The Harburg of Austria were closely aligned with their cousins,

188
00:09:59.190 --> 00:10:03.650
the Hapsburgs of Spain and the Spanish sent troops to support their ally that

189
00:10:03.651 --> 00:10:05.370
brought in the forces of the Dutch Republic,

190
00:10:05.670 --> 00:10:09.490
the sworn enemies of Spain on the side of the Protestants, England and France,

191
00:10:09.491 --> 00:10:10.450
who didn't like each other,

192
00:10:10.510 --> 00:10:14.410
but disliked the Hapsburgs even more agreed to give money to anyone who would

193
00:10:14.411 --> 00:10:15.690
fight against them in 16,

194
00:10:15.691 --> 00:10:18.240
20 I've Denmark intervened on behalf of the Protestants.

195
00:10:18.241 --> 00:10:22.120
But several years of war proved ineffective and the Danish tapped out after

196
00:10:22.121 --> 00:10:24.840
their resources were exhausted card Ando,

197
00:10:24.841 --> 00:10:28.720
the most powerful advisor to the king of France and the chief architect of the

198
00:10:28.880 --> 00:10:33.440
Alliance against the Habsburgs sought a new champion Gustavos OLS and the

199
00:10:33.630 --> 00:10:34.463
SWES

200
00:10:40.630 --> 00:10:44.150
Gustav ALS was known as a Marshall king from the very beginning.

201
00:10:44.210 --> 00:10:45.031
He ended the wars.

202
00:10:45.031 --> 00:10:48.510
He inherited from his father with Denmark and Russia within a few years of

203
00:10:48.670 --> 00:10:50.230
becoming king on favorable terms,

204
00:10:50.490 --> 00:10:53.230
but he was still involved in a protracted struggle with Poland.

205
00:10:53.250 --> 00:10:56.510
If he wanted to fully invest his country's resources into a fight with the holy

206
00:10:56.750 --> 00:11:00.660
re Emper, he needed to find a way to extricate himself from that conflict.

207
00:11:01.100 --> 00:11:05.780
Cardinal Richo intervened arranging for the two sides to sign the truths of ALS

208
00:11:05.940 --> 00:11:08.460
mark in 1629, ending the war. Now,

209
00:11:08.461 --> 00:11:11.780
Sweden could intervene in the chaos going on in Germany.

210
00:11:12.140 --> 00:11:14.420
Gustavos wanted to help his fellow Protestants,

211
00:11:14.480 --> 00:11:17.220
but his motives weren't entirely altruistic.

212
00:11:17.221 --> 00:11:21.010
This Swedish king saw an opportunity to enhance his country's prestige

213
00:11:21.250 --> 00:11:24.650
positioning himself as the defender of the Protestant faith.

214
00:11:24.790 --> 00:11:29.050
He also hoped to make territorial gain in continental Europe on the 4th of July

215
00:11:29.051 --> 00:11:33.370
16, 30, Gustav OVS landed at pen moons in Pomerania I,

216
00:11:33.590 --> 00:11:35.450
the head of an army of 13,000 men,

217
00:11:35.550 --> 00:11:38.680
he was facing a much larger army commanded by one of the M for his best

218
00:11:38.760 --> 00:11:40.840
generals, Johan CIS.

219
00:11:40.940 --> 00:11:45.600
The count of Tilly Tilly was an experienced and feared commander with many

220
00:11:45.601 --> 00:11:48.520
victories over Protestant armies to supplement his own forces.

221
00:11:49.240 --> 00:11:51.240
GAVS wanted to recruit allies from the German states,

222
00:11:51.340 --> 00:11:55.200
but the Germans were distrustful of the Swedish King's intentions and were

223
00:11:55.201 --> 00:11:57.440
unimpressed with his military credentials,

224
00:11:57.441 --> 00:11:59.880
especially compared to the Catholic general for months,

225
00:12:00.020 --> 00:12:04.400
the Swedish army was stuck in the little corner of Pomerania surrounded by

226
00:12:04.760 --> 00:12:06.280
Imperial health garrisons.

227
00:12:06.300 --> 00:12:10.840
The Catholic saw Gustava dolphins is nothing more than a minor, an annoyance.

228
00:12:10.900 --> 00:12:14.670
So they left him alone. While the main Imperial army is fought in Italy,

229
00:12:15.030 --> 00:12:18.430
but the STAM mate couldn't last forever. And at the start of 1631,

230
00:12:18.820 --> 00:12:20.270
both sides made their move.

231
00:12:26.690 --> 00:12:30.310
The Swedish army advanced south on the city of FRA capturing the town.

232
00:12:30.311 --> 00:12:31.430
After a short siege,

233
00:12:32.030 --> 00:12:35.380
Gustav's hoped to convince the Protestant states to join him in a show of force.

234
00:12:35.770 --> 00:12:38.420
So-called rough wing. Meanwhile,

235
00:12:38.560 --> 00:12:42.220
the main Imperial army under the count of till March north to Magnum Burg,

236
00:12:42.360 --> 00:12:46.660
one of the SWS allies and sacked the town slaughtering and estimated 20,000

237
00:12:46.661 --> 00:12:49.380
inhabitants, a dreadful show of force of his own,

238
00:12:49.450 --> 00:12:51.100
both armies marched towards each other,

239
00:12:51.330 --> 00:12:53.810
separated by the electorate of sax and me,

240
00:12:54.050 --> 00:12:57.490
which had as yet been untouched by the war and wanted to remain neutral.

241
00:12:57.491 --> 00:13:01.170
After weeks of negotiations, ly forced the issue by invading Saxony,

242
00:13:01.171 --> 00:13:04.090
forcing the Saxons to rely themselves with the Swedes for their own.

243
00:13:04.091 --> 00:13:08.290
Self-preservation the two armies ran into each other on the 7th of September,

244
00:13:08.290 --> 00:13:11.370
1631 at the village of Brighton felt close to the city of Lipsig.

245
00:13:11.430 --> 00:13:15.960
The battle began at midday with an exchange of the Swedish guns quickly proved

246
00:13:15.961 --> 00:13:20.120
their superior skill managing to fire off three to five Vols for everyone that

247
00:13:20.121 --> 00:13:23.840
the Imperials fired after the Imperial cavalry was rebuffed with heavy losses

248
00:13:24.080 --> 00:13:27.760
til he ordered his powerful infantry to attack the Saxon forces posted on the

249
00:13:27.761 --> 00:13:30.480
left flank of the allied line, routing them from the field.

250
00:13:30.740 --> 00:13:34.120
But the attackers strung out the Imperial forces in a disorganized line.

251
00:13:34.550 --> 00:13:37.230
One that the discipline Swedish troops moved to exploit.

252
00:13:37.460 --> 00:13:40.710
They surrounded the Imperials and annihilated the entire army.

253
00:13:40.810 --> 00:13:45.350
It was a complete tribe for Gustavos till his army sustained 27,000

254
00:13:45.351 --> 00:13:48.870
casualties. Over 75% of the original force.

255
00:13:49.090 --> 00:13:52.470
The destruction of the Imperial army was a huge morale boost for the Protestant.

256
00:13:52.750 --> 00:13:54.710
Cause for the first time, since the war began,

257
00:13:54.711 --> 00:13:57.820
they had a strategic initiative over their Catholic opponents.

258
00:13:58.100 --> 00:14:00.860
The Swedish King's victory was the talk of Europe and the German princes,

259
00:14:00.861 --> 00:14:03.900
which have been reluctant to align themselves with Gustavos before brighten

260
00:14:04.060 --> 00:14:07.740
fell, Hanover has castle and Brandenburg pressure among others.

261
00:14:08.200 --> 00:14:09.460
Now flocked to its banner.

262
00:14:09.680 --> 00:14:12.860
The French agreed to pay even greater subsidies for Sweden's army and

263
00:14:13.180 --> 00:14:17.610
reinforcement were pouring into the camp. It was I'm the Gustavus to go on.

264
00:14:17.611 --> 00:14:18.444
The offensive

265
00:14:24.350 --> 00:14:26.770
Armies of this period did not fight in the winter.

266
00:14:26.990 --> 00:14:30.410
So the war was paused soon after the battle of bright and fell as the cold

267
00:14:30.411 --> 00:14:34.170
weather set in, in March of 1632, the Swedish army emerged in winter quarters,

268
00:14:34.171 --> 00:14:36.760
numbering 40,000, including German allies.

269
00:14:36.820 --> 00:14:40.880
The target was Bavaria one of the wealthiest and strongest principalities on the

270
00:14:40.960 --> 00:14:44.000
Catholic side, it was hopes that by knocking Bavaria out of the war,

271
00:14:44.100 --> 00:14:47.920
it would force the emperor as, uh, the negotiating table on Protestant terms.

272
00:14:48.100 --> 00:14:50.320
If it didn't work well, Bavaria was close to Vienna.

273
00:14:50.380 --> 00:14:54.480
The Austrian capital where the holy Roman Em's court was and then marched.

274
00:14:54.720 --> 00:14:57.320
Then next in April, the SWS were situated across the river,

275
00:14:57.640 --> 00:15:01.800
lack from a reconstructed Imperial army under till the only obstacle between

276
00:15:01.801 --> 00:15:06.040
them and the Arian Heartland on the 15th of a Broga star designed to force

277
00:15:06.041 --> 00:15:09.320
crossing, military engineers built a pontoon bridge across the river,

278
00:15:09.370 --> 00:15:12.310
under fire from Imperial guts. Once again, however,

279
00:15:12.410 --> 00:15:14.710
the Swedish artillery proved its superiority.

280
00:15:14.850 --> 00:15:18.350
As they were able to successfully cover the infantry as they crossed and

281
00:15:18.351 --> 00:15:20.910
supported them as they stormed the Imperial position.

282
00:15:20.980 --> 00:15:23.470
Soon after crossing the decisive moment came when,

283
00:15:23.670 --> 00:15:27.150
til he was shot in the leg during the assault and was evacuated from the field

284
00:15:27.220 --> 00:15:30.230
without their general, the morale of the Imperial army collapsed.

285
00:15:30.250 --> 00:15:32.380
And they treated in a quirk of faith.

286
00:15:32.400 --> 00:15:36.180
The loss of till probably saved the army from being annihilated as it had been

287
00:15:36.200 --> 00:15:40.380
bright and Feld since Gustavos was in the process of encircling the Imperials,

288
00:15:40.400 --> 00:15:44.100
but hadn't managed to close the noose before the enemy fled till died.

289
00:15:44.200 --> 00:15:46.540
Two weeks after the battle, after his wound became infected,

290
00:15:47.060 --> 00:15:50.700
Southern BVA was now completely open to the Swedish army and they marched

291
00:15:50.701 --> 00:15:54.370
unopposed capturing town after town. Some of the larger cities,

292
00:15:54.371 --> 00:15:56.570
such as Munich and Augsburg were only occupied.

293
00:15:56.570 --> 00:16:00.290
If they managed to pay a ransom at large sum of gold to support their Protestant

294
00:16:00.490 --> 00:16:01.030
occupies,

295
00:16:01.030 --> 00:16:04.850
but the smaller cities and towns weren't so lucky and were put to the torch,

296
00:16:05.250 --> 00:16:08.890
their inhabitants killed or imprisoned such was the ugliness of a war of

297
00:16:09.050 --> 00:16:09.320
religion.

298
00:16:09.320 --> 00:16:13.520
This kind of conduct occurred throughout the 30 years are on both sides and

299
00:16:13.521 --> 00:16:17.640
estimated 8 million people died during the war from disease famine,

300
00:16:18.000 --> 00:16:18.833
a bloodshed.

301
00:16:18.860 --> 00:16:22.560
The death of the count of till had left the Imperial army leaderless and the REM

302
00:16:22.561 --> 00:16:25.480
paging Swedish army was increasingly alarming to emperor afer.

303
00:16:25.860 --> 00:16:28.840
He was forced to recall to command a man. He knew likes nor trusted,

304
00:16:28.860 --> 00:16:33.430
but who he felt was the only man who could match Gustavos do on the field of

305
00:16:33.431 --> 00:16:37.590
battle. AACH VA Valenstein was a celebrated general from earlier in the war.

306
00:16:37.610 --> 00:16:41.230
And he was directly responsible for knocking Denmark out of the conflict and had

307
00:16:41.231 --> 00:16:43.470
been rewarded handsomely for his military victories,

308
00:16:43.570 --> 00:16:47.230
but his accumulation of personal power in his ambition for more alarms,

309
00:16:47.231 --> 00:16:50.950
the emperor who saw him as a threat to his own authority in September 16th,

310
00:16:50.951 --> 00:16:51.784
30 while,

311
00:16:51.790 --> 00:16:56.140
and Stein had been dismissed command and had retired to his estate in Silesia.

312
00:16:56.320 --> 00:17:01.140
Now is back charged with raising a new army and stopping the Swedish king Stein

313
00:17:01.200 --> 00:17:05.300
had been paying attention to the way the Gustavos ALS went about the business of

314
00:17:05.301 --> 00:17:07.900
warfare and in the new Imperial army, he put together,

315
00:17:07.920 --> 00:17:11.020
he implemented some of the Swedish reforms to military organization.

316
00:17:11.420 --> 00:17:15.650
Einstein was popular among the common was able to quickly raise a new army and

317
00:17:15.651 --> 00:17:16.484
take to the field.

318
00:17:16.490 --> 00:17:20.490
Suddenly Gustava has found himself outnumbered rather than risk a battle.

319
00:17:20.550 --> 00:17:24.210
He retreated to the city of Nurenberg, which Boen Stein, besiege,

320
00:17:24.211 --> 00:17:26.490
hoping to starve the SWS out for three months.

321
00:17:26.630 --> 00:17:29.930
It was a STLE mate until Gustavos was forced to retreat out of aria,

322
00:17:30.200 --> 00:17:33.890
into Saxony, having lost half his army to disease and starvation.

323
00:17:34.080 --> 00:17:37.280
The Imperials hadn't failed much better and were unable to pursue for some time

324
00:17:43.700 --> 00:17:46.960
For months while Stein and Augustas had been circling each other with their

325
00:17:46.961 --> 00:17:50.320
armies, but neither had been able to entice the other into a decisive battle.

326
00:17:50.760 --> 00:17:52.320
November was late in the campaign season.

327
00:17:52.500 --> 00:17:56.520
The Iberia army was preparing to go into their winter quarters and Saxony Gustav

328
00:17:57.040 --> 00:18:00.440
ALS was shaving at his forced retreat at the hands of his opponents and wanted

329
00:18:00.620 --> 00:18:04.080
one more crack at violence dying before the weather made further movement in

330
00:18:04.200 --> 00:18:04.680
possible.

331
00:18:04.680 --> 00:18:07.840
The SWS marched out of camp and headed towards the last known position of the

332
00:18:07.841 --> 00:18:08.320
enemy.

333
00:18:08.320 --> 00:18:12.950
A hoping to take the Imperials by surprise in their hast V left the haunted

334
00:18:12.960 --> 00:18:14.590
three pound cannons in camp.

335
00:18:14.730 --> 00:18:18.030
The attempted surprise attack failed when the Swedish army ran into Imperial

336
00:18:18.430 --> 00:18:21.190
rear guard station five kilometers south of the town of Luzon.

337
00:18:21.470 --> 00:18:24.470
This skirmish delayed the Swedish advance by several allowers and alerted one

338
00:18:24.910 --> 00:18:28.470
Instein to the danger, allowing him to recall his disparate forces Feld.

339
00:18:28.790 --> 00:18:32.380
Then the meters were a couple of kilometers apart preparing for a fight the next

340
00:18:32.480 --> 00:18:35.980
day, according to the Gregorian calendar, which is what we used today,

341
00:18:36.040 --> 00:18:39.100
the next day was the 16th of November, 1632.

342
00:18:39.160 --> 00:18:41.100
The Swed still used the old Julian calendar.

343
00:18:41.360 --> 00:18:44.500
So to them it was the sick of November. Whatever the date was,

344
00:18:44.840 --> 00:18:48.780
it dawned extremely foggy making its hard to see both armies were about equal

345
00:18:48.980 --> 00:18:50.610
strength out 20,000 men.

346
00:18:50.770 --> 00:18:55.290
Each Wallen Stein's army was deployed along the Lutsen leig road in a defensive

347
00:18:55.450 --> 00:18:56.650
position complete with trenches.

348
00:18:56.750 --> 00:18:59.930
The Swedes were in position to assault this line by 11:00 AM.

349
00:19:00.450 --> 00:19:01.970
Gustav led his troops into battle.

350
00:19:02.070 --> 00:19:05.490
As he always did riding a magnificent Warhorse named strife.

351
00:19:05.590 --> 00:19:09.170
He had been shot in the shoulder by a Polish musketeer in 1627,

352
00:19:09.270 --> 00:19:11.600
and the ball ever been removed. The old injury,

353
00:19:11.601 --> 00:19:15.040
reduced his arm ability and prevented him from wearing the Bulletproof steel

354
00:19:15.760 --> 00:19:19.680
Kiras or breast plates that was typically worn by officer of this period.

355
00:19:19.940 --> 00:19:23.200
The battle started off well for the Swedes as they attacked the Imperial left

356
00:19:23.250 --> 00:19:27.080
flank, which was weak. They were met by a cavalry charge led by Gottfried zoo.

357
00:19:27.640 --> 00:19:29.560
Papen Heim, the Imperial second demand.

358
00:19:29.670 --> 00:19:33.510
They repulsed the but Papen Heim was shot by a cannibal and killed.

359
00:19:33.511 --> 00:19:35.390
This caused the counteract collapse.

360
00:19:35.450 --> 00:19:38.950
Seeing an opening Gustava dolphins put together a cavalry attack of his own.

361
00:19:39.010 --> 00:19:43.350
The confused LA around the left flank of the Imperial battle line only got

362
00:19:43.550 --> 00:19:47.150
worse. When the King's cavalry charge hit was round 1:00 PM two hours into the

363
00:19:47.151 --> 00:19:49.430
engagement. When Gustava sustained his first wound,

364
00:19:49.550 --> 00:19:51.580
a must shot that hit him in the left arm,

365
00:19:51.581 --> 00:19:54.900
crushing it around the same time his horse was hit in the neck,

366
00:19:54.901 --> 00:19:58.260
making it very hard to control the fog and smoke swelled around the field.

367
00:19:58.320 --> 00:19:59.260
And in the confusion,

368
00:19:59.261 --> 00:20:02.740
the king rode behind enemy lines and was attacked by a squadron of Imperial

369
00:20:02.850 --> 00:20:03.360
cavalry.

370
00:20:03.360 --> 00:20:06.940
He was shot again in the back as well as suffering cuts from sword thrusts and

371
00:20:07.120 --> 00:20:10.980
he fell off his horse. He was shot a final time in the temple and it killed him.

372
00:20:11.200 --> 00:20:12.450
He was 37 years old.

373
00:20:18.710 --> 00:20:22.330
No one knew what had happened to the king for hours during a blow in battle.

374
00:20:22.650 --> 00:20:24.810
His horse was spotted wandering around between the lines.

375
00:20:25.490 --> 00:20:28.890
RALS the momentum of the battle stalled as a search was commenced.

376
00:20:29.050 --> 00:20:32.400
Gustav's body was found soon after it had been partially stripped to of his

377
00:20:32.760 --> 00:20:36.720
outer clothes and jewelry and left to avoid destroying the morale of the army.

378
00:20:36.740 --> 00:20:39.840
The King's body was removed from the field in secret Bernhard, OFS,

379
00:20:40.080 --> 00:20:41.320
SACS Vira German prince,

380
00:20:41.460 --> 00:20:43.760
who was the second in command for the Protestant forces,

381
00:20:44.160 --> 00:20:46.840
took command of the army after being told of the King's death.

382
00:20:46.860 --> 00:20:50.160
And the fight continued. The brutal battle finished around nightfall.

383
00:20:50.161 --> 00:20:54.280
When the Swedes took the Imperial artillery battery and turned the guns on their

384
00:20:54.281 --> 00:20:56.960
former owners compelling while Instein to retreat,

385
00:20:57.320 --> 00:20:59.720
to live Zi and leave the field to the Swedes.

386
00:20:59.820 --> 00:21:03.560
It was the definition of per victory for Sweden. They had won the day,

387
00:21:03.620 --> 00:21:08.030
but at horrific cost, not only had they suffered 10,000 casualties,

388
00:21:08.090 --> 00:21:11.510
but the loss of baking was to prove fatal to the Swedish expedition though,

389
00:21:11.540 --> 00:21:13.310
they would remain at war with the empire.

390
00:21:13.380 --> 00:21:16.670
They would no longer assume a leading role in the coalition. Instead,

391
00:21:17.030 --> 00:21:20.350
France seeing the Swedish momentum stall decided to intervene directly in the

392
00:21:20.351 --> 00:21:21.470
war and thereafter,

393
00:21:21.530 --> 00:21:25.510
the war became less about religion and more about the ancestral rivalry between

394
00:21:25.511 --> 00:21:29.660
the French house of Bo Bon of the Austrian and Spanish houses of Habsburg.

395
00:21:29.800 --> 00:21:33.740
It took almost two years to kink Gustav's body to be returned to Sweden and

396
00:21:33.741 --> 00:21:34.700
buried in Stockholm.

397
00:21:34.840 --> 00:21:38.500
He was accompanied by his horse STR who was staffed after his death and is still

398
00:21:38.501 --> 00:21:40.620
displayed dead at the Royal armor in Stockholm.

399
00:21:40.720 --> 00:21:44.340
His death left the throne of Sweden to his five year old daughter, Christina,

400
00:21:44.520 --> 00:21:47.220
who would later go on to convert to Catholicism,

401
00:21:47.460 --> 00:21:51.210
AB cater crown and lived the rest of her life in Rome as the guest of the Pope,

402
00:21:51.570 --> 00:21:55.010
none of which was likely to have made her father happy as VA's opponents

403
00:21:55.650 --> 00:21:56.290
Alberton Valenstein.

404
00:21:56.290 --> 00:21:59.730
He was destined not to outlive Savvis for long and preferred an anti

405
00:22:00.130 --> 00:22:01.650
assassinated in 1634,

406
00:22:01.740 --> 00:22:05.490
after a report surface that the general was preparing to defect the Protestants.

407
00:22:05.630 --> 00:22:10.600
The piece of west failure finally ended the 30 years war in 1648 and

408
00:22:10.740 --> 00:22:13.280
was considered a major victory for the Protestant powers.

409
00:22:13.380 --> 00:22:17.120
The treaties guaranteed the freedom of each state within the holy Roman empire

410
00:22:17.400 --> 00:22:20.840
to choose their own religion and also guaranteed the right of all citizens to

411
00:22:21.000 --> 00:22:22.040
practice their religion in private,

412
00:22:22.350 --> 00:22:24.760
even if it was different from the state religion, where they lived,

413
00:22:24.900 --> 00:22:28.950
it was also a recognition of Sweden as one of the great military power hours of

414
00:22:28.951 --> 00:22:29.190
Europe,

415
00:22:29.190 --> 00:22:33.470
granting territory in Pomerania and SPER and the holy remin empire projecting

416
00:22:33.690 --> 00:22:35.830
its influence over most of Northern Germany,

417
00:22:35.970 --> 00:22:37.630
indeed for the rest of the 17th century,

418
00:22:37.650 --> 00:22:40.750
the Swedish empire was considered one of the most powerful on the Conson even

419
00:22:40.751 --> 00:22:42.670
establishing their own colony in the new world.

420
00:22:43.090 --> 00:22:46.110
New Sweden located on the site of the modern day city of Philadelphia,

421
00:22:46.190 --> 00:22:48.750
Pennsylvania though the age of the Swedish empire,

422
00:22:48.870 --> 00:22:50.380
a only lasted for about a century.

423
00:22:50.520 --> 00:22:53.540
The ideas put forward by Gustav ALS lasted much longer.

424
00:22:53.760 --> 00:22:58.220
His military tactics and organizational style was studied and copied by generals

425
00:22:58.540 --> 00:23:02.380
the generations after his death in particular by Napoleon Bonna party used

426
00:23:02.580 --> 00:23:06.260
Gustav's theory of superior fire power to conquer most a continental Europe.

427
00:23:06.820 --> 00:23:06.960
What's more,

428
00:23:06.960 --> 00:23:10.890
he left a legacy as being a staunched defender of the Protestant religion.

429
00:23:10.950 --> 00:23:12.050
And because of his efforts,

430
00:23:12.070 --> 00:23:15.610
the idea that an individual was able to choose their own religious belief and

431
00:23:15.810 --> 00:23:19.250
practice it without interference from the government remains an integral part of

432
00:23:19.251 --> 00:23:22.410
most modern countries though, he has been dead for almost 400 years.

433
00:23:22.430 --> 00:23:26.890
Gustav ALS continues to cast along shadow the human incarnation of the German

434
00:23:26.891 --> 00:23:30.560
legend of the line of the north. So I really hope you this video,
