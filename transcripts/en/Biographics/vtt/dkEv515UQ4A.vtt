00:00:01.961 --> 00:00:05.800
The first a hundred people to go to blinkers.com/biographics will get one week's

3
00:00:05.801 --> 00:00:09.640
tried out for free. They'll also get 25% off the cons full membership,

4
00:00:09.950 --> 00:00:10.920
more on them in a bit.

5
00:00:16.900 --> 00:00:20.910
The Americans civil war was the worst ly in the history of the United eights.

6
00:00:20.911 --> 00:00:25.190
Americans killed each other by the hundreds of thousands burned and destroyed

7
00:00:25.191 --> 00:00:29.310
their own cities and nearly tore the entire country into in the process.

8
00:00:29.450 --> 00:00:31.790
It made many men into heroes on both sides.

9
00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:34.950
And one of the foremost of these is Ulysses grant.

10
00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:38.310
The civil war saved grant from a life of failure and obscurity,

11
00:00:38.410 --> 00:00:42.340
his brilliant tactical and strategic acumen would Ian rise to commands the

12
00:00:42.440 --> 00:00:45.980
entire union army matching wits with the south Robert E. Lee.

13
00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:48.740
He oversaw the final victory of the north over the south,

14
00:00:48.741 --> 00:00:51.900
destroying the institution of slavery in the United States forever.

15
00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:55.820
He helped oversee the reconstruction of the south first as commanding general.

16
00:00:55.960 --> 00:00:57.860
And then as president of the United States,

17
00:00:58.040 --> 00:00:59.700
he helps rebuild the economy of the country,

18
00:01:00.220 --> 00:01:02.810
creating the department of justice to fight the KU Clark's Klan.

19
00:01:02.870 --> 00:01:07.010
And he laid the foundation of the modern federal governments by establishing the

20
00:01:07.011 --> 00:01:09.930
civil service commission. And yet Grandey almost painless.

21
00:01:10.030 --> 00:01:12.130
And in historical analysis of his life,

22
00:01:12.280 --> 00:01:16.570
more emphasis is given to his shortcomings and failures than his successes.

23
00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:18.770
Critics have called him a drunk, a butcher,

24
00:01:18.890 --> 00:01:22.600
a corrupts politician only recently has his reputation begun to be

25
00:01:22.601 --> 00:01:23.434
rehabilitated.

26
00:01:23.620 --> 00:01:28.560
So why was history so unkind to ES grant since what is the

27
00:01:28.561 --> 00:01:31.760
real story behind his remarkable life?

28
00:01:37.780 --> 00:01:42.240
Her MUN grant was born on April the 22nd, 1822 in point pleasant,

29
00:01:42.870 --> 00:01:43.070
Ohio,

30
00:01:43.070 --> 00:01:47.430
a small community on the Ohio river located 25 miles Southeast of Cincinnati.

31
00:01:47.610 --> 00:01:49.630
His father, Jesse operated tannery,

32
00:01:49.631 --> 00:01:53.630
which young ulyses hated local children made fun of his naivety calling him

33
00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:54.670
useless grants.

34
00:01:54.690 --> 00:01:57.590
<v 1>But the young grants developed an affinity for TAing and riding horses,</v>

35
00:01:57.591 --> 00:02:00.390
something that served in wealth throughout his life. Jesse grants,

36
00:02:00.391 --> 00:02:04.740
figuring his son wasn't destined for the life of a wrote to his Congressman and

37
00:02:04.741 --> 00:02:08.500
secures an appointment for UES to the United States military academy at west

38
00:02:08.780 --> 00:02:10.060
point in 1839,

39
00:02:10.090 --> 00:02:13.660
when he was enrolled in west point E clerical era was made listening his name as

40
00:02:14.100 --> 00:02:16.300
UES ES grant, rather than fighting to have it changed.

41
00:02:16.350 --> 00:02:19.220
Grant lived with it and went by the name for the rest of his life.

42
00:02:19.360 --> 00:02:23.460
His friends at the academy nicknamed him uncle Sam grant because his new initial

43
00:02:23.890 --> 00:02:24.723
alls were us.

44
00:02:24.790 --> 00:02:27.050
<v 0>And just later shortened it to Sam.</v>

45
00:02:27.310 --> 00:02:31.410
He was an indifferent student graduating in the middle of his class in 1843,

46
00:02:31.411 --> 00:02:32.290
but while he was there,

47
00:02:32.390 --> 00:02:35.930
he became acquainted with many of the officers he would either serve with or

48
00:02:35.931 --> 00:02:37.290
fight against during the civil war,

49
00:02:37.350 --> 00:02:41.650
the class of 1843 produced 15 union generals and three Confederate generals

50
00:02:41.770 --> 00:02:42.930
outta 39 graduates.

51
00:02:43.080 --> 00:02:46.680
Grant's closest friend at the academy where Frederick dens and James Long

52
00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:50.400
street, who both became generals one in the north and one in the south.

53
00:02:50.580 --> 00:02:51.920
It wasn't long after graduating.

54
00:02:51.921 --> 00:02:55.920
The young grants became swept up in the great political event of the 1840s,

55
00:02:56.420 --> 00:02:57.760
the Mexican American war

56
00:03:04.280 --> 00:03:05.001
In 1836,

57
00:03:05.001 --> 00:03:09.040
citizens of the Mexican province of Texas revolted against Mexico defeating the

58
00:03:09.041 --> 00:03:11.880
army of general Santana and winning independence.

59
00:03:11.881 --> 00:03:15.280
Texas was intern annexed by the United States in 1845.

60
00:03:15.470 --> 00:03:18.160
This immediately sparked tensions with the Mexican government.

61
00:03:18.280 --> 00:03:23.110
J Santa Anna was still in power and was humiliated by his defeat at the hands

62
00:03:23.210 --> 00:03:24.710
of the Texans. What's worse.

63
00:03:24.770 --> 00:03:28.270
The Republic of Texas claimed its border extended all the way down to the Rio

64
00:03:28.370 --> 00:03:31.750
Grande, a claim adopted by the United States. After it ATS, Texas,

65
00:03:31.890 --> 00:03:36.310
Mexico still viewed this as its territory and vowed to defend it. James K.

66
00:03:36.310 --> 00:03:39.980
Paul had been elected president of the United States in 1840 on about who

67
00:03:40.090 --> 00:03:43.740
expands the territory of the United States by any means necessary under the

68
00:03:43.741 --> 00:03:48.060
philosophy of manifest destiny, he was spoiling for a fight and in 1846,

69
00:03:48.080 --> 00:03:51.340
he finally got one. When the United States went to war against Mexico,

70
00:03:51.680 --> 00:03:54.500
the us army invaded Mexico striking out for Mexico city.

71
00:03:54.600 --> 00:03:55.540
One of the men in general,

72
00:03:55.570 --> 00:04:00.530
Zachary Taylor army was Lieutenant uny as grant some line as a quarter master.

73
00:04:00.750 --> 00:04:04.170
He distinguished himself at the battle of Montey riding a horse past enemy

74
00:04:04.240 --> 00:04:08.530
snipers to deliver a dispatch for reinforcement grants unit was transferred to a

75
00:04:08.531 --> 00:04:10.690
new army commanded by general Winfield,

76
00:04:10.780 --> 00:04:15.050
Scott who invaded Vera Cruz from the sea heading towards the Mexico capital.

77
00:04:15.340 --> 00:04:18.410
Scott took the city in late 1847 in the United States,

78
00:04:18.430 --> 00:04:21.520
forced Mexico to see not only the territory claimed by Texas,

79
00:04:21.820 --> 00:04:26.160
but the provinces of California and New Mexico as well ending the war in

80
00:04:26.360 --> 00:04:27.640
February,

81
00:04:27.640 --> 00:04:31.160
1848 grant had distinguished himself during Scott's campaign and came outta the

82
00:04:31.161 --> 00:04:32.160
war with a rank of captain.

83
00:04:32.460 --> 00:04:36.240
The Mexican war had given grants and many other future civil war commanders,

84
00:04:36.520 --> 00:04:37.520
valuable combat experience.

85
00:04:37.760 --> 00:04:41.230
<v 1>A one point during the war grants met another Mexican war hero in Lieutenant</v>

86
00:04:41.231 --> 00:04:42.630
Colonel named Robert Lee,

87
00:04:42.770 --> 00:04:46.270
but grants like many others thought the war to be morally unjust.

88
00:04:46.410 --> 00:04:51.230
He saw it for what it was a war of territorial expansion of conquest,

89
00:04:51.231 --> 00:04:52.190
which isn't something,

90
00:04:52.390 --> 00:04:56.310
a democratic Republic like the United States should be engaged in later.

91
00:04:56.370 --> 00:04:59.990
He would find that the civil war was divine retribution for the country's

92
00:05:00.430 --> 00:05:01.263
aggression against Mexico.

93
00:05:07.560 --> 00:05:08.393
<v 0>The war with Mexico,</v>

94
00:05:08.600 --> 00:05:13.460
rather than uniting the country behind a common cause only deepens the regional

95
00:05:13.461 --> 00:05:17.580
tensions between the north and the south slavery hung over the country like a

96
00:05:17.740 --> 00:05:20.540
sword of dam driving the country further apart.

97
00:05:21.060 --> 00:05:24.890
UN aunt experienced the strife personally soon after the end of the war,

98
00:05:25.080 --> 00:05:27.170
when grant returned home in 1848,

99
00:05:27.171 --> 00:05:30.970
he married Julia D the sister of his friends and classmate Frederick.

100
00:05:31.310 --> 00:05:32.770
His father refused to attend the wedding,

101
00:05:32.830 --> 00:05:34.410
not because he disapproved of the marriage,

102
00:05:34.510 --> 00:05:36.090
but because the dent family were prominent,

103
00:05:36.370 --> 00:05:40.410
Missouri slaveholders and Jesse Grant was an Arden's abolitionist grant was

104
00:05:40.411 --> 00:05:44.080
transferred from one desolate army pose to another on the frontiers of the

105
00:05:44.081 --> 00:05:44.430
country,

106
00:05:44.430 --> 00:05:48.680
separated from his family and bored with the mundane nature of day to day

107
00:05:48.681 --> 00:05:51.120
Barrack's life grants began to drink to excess.

108
00:05:51.230 --> 00:05:54.200
This got him into trouble and he was forced to resign his army commission in

109
00:05:54.360 --> 00:05:57.560
1854. He return home then made a go at farming, building a home.

110
00:05:57.700 --> 00:06:00.880
He called hard scrap on land given to him by his father-in-law.

111
00:06:01.160 --> 00:06:04.440
It was a failure and grants at one point was so poor that he pawed his gold

112
00:06:04.441 --> 00:06:07.760
watch to buy Christmas presents for his children in late 1858,

113
00:06:07.761 --> 00:06:11.520
after his farm failed, his father-in-law gave him a slave named William Jones.

114
00:06:11.860 --> 00:06:13.440
Slaves were incredibly valuable.

115
00:06:13.800 --> 00:06:16.870
Property grants could have gotten up to a thousand dollars for Joe owns.

116
00:06:17.050 --> 00:06:20.630
If he had sold him a large amount of money when the average salary was less than

117
00:06:20.631 --> 00:06:22.350
$20 a month, but grants,

118
00:06:22.510 --> 00:06:26.310
although not a political abolitionist like his father was personally opposed to

119
00:06:26.311 --> 00:06:29.910
the practice. And in March, 1859, he set William Jones free.

120
00:06:30.090 --> 00:06:33.390
By the end of 1860 grant had been reduced to a position as a clerk in his

121
00:06:33.391 --> 00:06:34.224
father's leather,

122
00:06:34.270 --> 00:06:38.580
good store in Illinois grant didn't support Lincoln in the presidential election

123
00:06:38.690 --> 00:06:39.280
that year,

124
00:06:39.280 --> 00:06:43.140
but was still appalled by the succession of the Southern states in the beginning

125
00:06:43.160 --> 00:06:45.140
of the civil war in April, 1861.

126
00:06:45.140 --> 00:06:48.780
When Lincoln calls for 75,000 volunteers to put down the rebellion grant,

127
00:06:48.781 --> 00:06:52.780
decided to put his army uniform back on to join the fight. Now,

128
00:06:52.781 --> 00:06:54.260
before we get into the impending civil war,

129
00:06:54.340 --> 00:06:56.860
I wanted to take a moment to give a quick shout out to you.

130
00:06:56.861 --> 00:06:58.610
Today's video sponsor link.

131
00:06:59.090 --> 00:07:02.450
It's not always to find the time to sit down and read all the books. Uh,

132
00:07:02.690 --> 00:07:05.010
you want, you may have noticed that I'm a pretty busy guy.

133
00:07:05.170 --> 00:07:09.250
I post a lot of these videos and I don't have as much time as I used to to read

134
00:07:09.270 --> 00:07:12.890
all the books I want. Dear general grant might know what I'm talking about.

135
00:07:12.950 --> 00:07:16.730
He spent a lot of his life busy, whether that's fighting or drinking. I mean,

136
00:07:16.731 --> 00:07:20.400
who can be bothered to read books when this perfectly drinkable whiskey lying

137
00:07:20.401 --> 00:07:24.120
around? Fortunately, I have Blinkus grant didn't,

138
00:07:24.130 --> 00:07:26.840
which is an app that offers easily digestible,

139
00:07:26.841 --> 00:07:29.440
15 minute summaries of all the best non-fiction books.

140
00:07:29.460 --> 00:07:31.720
And there are thousands of books in their catalog.

141
00:07:31.900 --> 00:07:33.680
You can either read them or listen to them.

142
00:07:34.000 --> 00:07:36.480
I personally recommend a book that I recently read,

143
00:07:36.481 --> 00:07:40.710
and I very much enjoyed reading the Blinkus for sort of a recap to get all the

144
00:07:40.711 --> 00:07:44.710
key pieces of knowledge from a long book that would be principles by Ray Dalio,

145
00:07:44.800 --> 00:07:47.750
which is a great read, check it out. Onlin personally,

146
00:07:47.870 --> 00:07:49.550
I listen to books about 90% of the time,

147
00:07:49.580 --> 00:07:53.630
just sort of like a podcast or an audio book is just easier to fit into the day

148
00:07:53.631 --> 00:07:57.350
while doing mindless things like commuting to work or just doing some chores

149
00:07:57.351 --> 00:08:00.380
around the house. Blink has 14 million active users,

150
00:08:00.720 --> 00:08:04.700
and they get the best insights and need to know info from thousands of books

151
00:08:04.730 --> 00:08:08.660
self-help to business, to health, whatever you're into it's on that.

152
00:08:08.661 --> 00:08:12.180
They also have excellent curated lists where the blink is teamed and also guests

153
00:08:12.280 --> 00:08:14.020

154
00:08:14.250 --> 00:08:17.220
like how to future proof yourself or just some of their favorites.

159
00:08:33.370 --> 00:08:34.610
blinkers.com/biographics and let's get back to it.

160
00:08:41.360 --> 00:08:45.000
Grando is recommissioning to you. The patronage of Congressman Alabi Washburn,

161
00:08:45.360 --> 00:08:48.760
Illinois, who knew grant as a fellow gal residence,

162
00:08:48.960 --> 00:08:52.640
Washburn secured grants appointment first as Colonel over regimen of Illinois

163
00:08:52.641 --> 00:08:54.520
volunteers. And then as a Brigadier general,

164
00:08:54.780 --> 00:08:58.240
he engaged in some small battles with the Confederate forces in Southeastern

165
00:08:58.600 --> 00:09:01.160
Missouri and in Kentucky and in February,

166
00:09:01.160 --> 00:09:04.680
1862 conceived of a plan to capture two important Confederate river forts in

167
00:09:04.840 --> 00:09:07.200
Tennessee, Fort Henry and Fort Donaldson.

168
00:09:07.220 --> 00:09:10.760
He captured both of them demanding immediate and unconditional surrender from

169
00:09:10.761 --> 00:09:11.640
Confederate general,

170
00:09:11.810 --> 00:09:16.430
Simon bbar BNA and his army 12,000 inside for

171
00:09:16.431 --> 00:09:19.670
Donaldson. It was the first union triumph of the war in newspapers,

172
00:09:19.990 --> 00:09:22.550
nicknamed him unconditional surrender grants,

173
00:09:22.551 --> 00:09:25.510
promoted to major general grant was put at the head of the army of the

174
00:09:25.630 --> 00:09:28.430
Tennessee, some 40,000 strong from Fort Henry.

175
00:09:28.490 --> 00:09:30.030
He moved south along the Tennessee river,

176
00:09:30.230 --> 00:09:34.030
and it camped at Pittsburgh landing near a small meeting house called Shao

177
00:09:34.031 --> 00:09:34.864
church.

178
00:09:35.040 --> 00:09:39.060
He was to wait and link up with the army of the Ohio commanded by Don Carlos BU

179
00:09:39.130 --> 00:09:40.900
advancing south from Nashville.

180
00:09:40.920 --> 00:09:43.700
And then together they would March on the city of Corinth, Mississippi,

181
00:09:43.840 --> 00:09:45.940
the Confederate general Albert Sydney Johnston.

182
00:09:46.120 --> 00:09:49.220
Wasn't going to sit around and wait for grants to be reinforced.

183
00:09:49.221 --> 00:09:53.100
His army of Mississippi was of a comparable strength grant and he result to take

184
00:09:53.101 --> 00:09:54.540
the union army by surprise,

185
00:09:54.880 --> 00:09:59.050
cut it off from the river and destroy it just before 6:00 AM on April the sixth,

186
00:09:59.250 --> 00:10:03.530
1862 Johnston's army was a raid for battle less than two miles from the union

187
00:10:03.600 --> 00:10:07.570
army who didn't realize that they were coming grant decided to entrench his

188
00:10:07.730 --> 00:10:09.130
position because his army was green.

189
00:10:09.190 --> 00:10:12.210
And he figured what they needed was more practice with their guns,

190
00:10:12.510 --> 00:10:13.650
not with their shovels.

191
00:10:13.651 --> 00:10:17.080
This was the start of a habit with grant to concern him so off more with his own

192
00:10:17.090 --> 00:10:21.040
plans than those of his enemy. When it works, it worked out well when it didn't,

193
00:10:21.420 --> 00:10:23.520
it could be disastrous by 7:00 AM.

194
00:10:23.521 --> 00:10:25.360
The Confederates were attacking the union lines.

195
00:10:25.540 --> 00:10:29.400
The union men were taking completely by surprise and many initially broken ran.

196
00:10:29.401 --> 00:10:32.680
Other units stood and fought of it or pushed back under heavy far,

197
00:10:32.820 --> 00:10:35.080
the fighting was ferocious close range.

198
00:10:35.800 --> 00:10:39.390
Musketry busting entire lines of soldiers to bits on both sides.

199
00:10:39.650 --> 00:10:43.350
Key to the defense was one of Grant's division commanders, general William T.

200
00:10:43.350 --> 00:10:46.350
Sherman, who seemed to be everywhere on his part of the battlefield.

201
00:10:46.530 --> 00:10:50.550
He continuously rallied his man into a stubborn defense was wounded twice and

202
00:10:50.750 --> 00:10:53.230
had three horses shot out from under him. Nonetheless,

203
00:10:53.330 --> 00:10:56.870
the Confederates continued to advance until noon when their advance began to

204
00:10:56.871 --> 00:10:59.020
slow, not only due to the union resistance,

205
00:10:59.080 --> 00:11:03.220
but because the Confederates had overrun the union camp and many soldiers who

206
00:11:03.221 --> 00:11:05.260
had run out of rations stopped to plunder to food.

207
00:11:05.400 --> 00:11:09.100
The Confederates were further delayed by a union division commanded by Benjamin

208
00:11:09.860 --> 00:11:12.980
printers who put up a stubborn defense at a place called the haunt nest for

209
00:11:12.981 --> 00:11:14.820
several hours, rather than bypass it.

210
00:11:14.821 --> 00:11:17.380
The Confederates kept charging it and taking heavy casualties.

211
00:11:17.970 --> 00:11:21.370
Brent eventually ran out of ammunition and had to surrender his 2000 men,

212
00:11:21.550 --> 00:11:25.650
but he bought enough time for grant to establish a firm defensive position near

213
00:11:25.651 --> 00:11:26.530
Pittsburgh landing.

214
00:11:26.670 --> 00:11:29.690
The Confederate cause was weakened still further by the death of their

215
00:11:29.691 --> 00:11:33.290
commanding general Johnston had been wounded behind his right knee and didn't

216
00:11:33.291 --> 00:11:36.650
realize how much he was bleeding because the blood filled his boot where nor

217
00:11:36.651 --> 00:11:38.680
could see it with no doctor attend to him.

218
00:11:39.120 --> 00:11:41.560
He bled to death on the field on now past general,

219
00:11:41.760 --> 00:11:46.560
P G T Beau regard famous as the man who fired the first shot on Fort Sumter that

220
00:11:46.561 --> 00:11:50.040
began the war year before be regard sent to telegram, to Jefferson Davis,

221
00:11:50.041 --> 00:11:53.080
president of the Confederacy announcing a complete victory.

222
00:11:53.440 --> 00:11:56.400
I have grants just where I want him and can finish him up in the morning.

223
00:11:56.840 --> 00:11:59.120
Fighting pause for the night is both sides caught their breath.

224
00:11:59.300 --> 00:12:03.440
It started rain and the wet weather combined with the cries of the wounded made

225
00:12:03.680 --> 00:12:05.640
for a miserable night for both sides,

226
00:12:05.790 --> 00:12:09.440
general Sherman found grants standing under a tree sheltering from the rain and

227
00:12:09.441 --> 00:12:14.070
smoking a cigar while grants we've had the devil day haven't we shaman said

228
00:12:14.450 --> 00:12:17.310
grants, Cooley puffing. His cigar replied. Yes,

229
00:12:17.990 --> 00:12:21.790
like tomorrow though another general might have thought the prudent thing to do

230
00:12:21.810 --> 00:12:25.310
was to retreat or at least remain on the defensive,

231
00:12:25.450 --> 00:12:29.870
but grants was being reinforced throughout the night by 20,000 fresh troops as

232
00:12:30.010 --> 00:12:31.030
Bill's army arrived.

233
00:12:31.290 --> 00:12:34.860
And he was not a general that being on the defensive on that morning,

234
00:12:34.861 --> 00:12:35.541
April the seventh,

235
00:12:35.541 --> 00:12:39.660
it was grants turn to attack and it was the Confederate turn to be surprised all

236
00:12:39.661 --> 00:12:43.980
day, there was more vicious fighting until ARDS army was driven from the field.

237
00:12:44.040 --> 00:12:48.100
And the union army was left where it had started the day before the cost of the

238
00:12:48.101 --> 00:12:49.460
battle of Chilo shocked,

239
00:12:49.480 --> 00:12:54.450
the nation 13,000 union and 10,700 Confederate it by far

240
00:12:54.710 --> 00:12:56.450
the bloodiest battle of the water date,

241
00:12:56.550 --> 00:13:00.050
the newspapers that had commended grant in February now castigate him,

242
00:13:00.120 --> 00:13:03.770
blaming him for the high casualty counts and for being surprised on the first

243
00:13:03.771 --> 00:13:04.510
day of the battle,

244
00:13:04.510 --> 00:13:07.570
the fact that he rallied in the night and won the battle on the second day was

245
00:13:07.571 --> 00:13:09.650
largely overlooked reporters, spread rumors.

246
00:13:09.651 --> 00:13:11.850
That grant was drunk during the battle. In fact,

247
00:13:11.851 --> 00:13:13.690
while grant had a problem with alcohol, his,

248
00:13:14.240 --> 00:13:17.520
our life that is well known that he never drank while in battle or in the middle

249
00:13:17.521 --> 00:13:19.840
of a campaign. Nonetheless, Henry Hallock,

250
00:13:19.940 --> 00:13:22.160
the commander of the union armies in the west,

251
00:13:22.340 --> 00:13:25.200
who personally despised into was perhaps jealous of grants,

252
00:13:25.560 --> 00:13:27.760
used the battle to try and force grant out of the army.

253
00:13:27.870 --> 00:13:31.560
Abraham Lincoln interceded on Grant's behalf. I can't spare this man.

254
00:13:31.900 --> 00:13:33.480
He said he fights

255
00:13:39.720 --> 00:13:42.190
After being temporarily removed from command grant,

256
00:13:42.430 --> 00:13:44.870
considered resigning from the army in the aftermath of Shao,

257
00:13:44.930 --> 00:13:46.910
it was Sherman who convinced him to stay.

258
00:13:46.930 --> 00:13:50.230
And soon grant was back in action in January,

259
00:13:50.230 --> 00:13:53.710
1863 Grant's army of the Tennessee was to take the city of Vicksburg.

260
00:13:53.711 --> 00:13:57.300
Mississippi Vicksburg was the last Confederate strong points on the Mississippi

261
00:13:57.301 --> 00:13:58.940
river. If it was taken by the union,

262
00:13:59.080 --> 00:14:02.940
the Confederacy would be cut in half with union Naval vessels blockading,

263
00:14:02.960 --> 00:14:03.900
all Southern ports.

264
00:14:03.901 --> 00:14:07.980
It would also remove the only Overland route that the Confederacy had to get

265
00:14:07.981 --> 00:14:11.820
supplies in from overseas Vicksburg. Wasn't an easy fortres to crack though.

266
00:14:11.821 --> 00:14:14.660
It was located on high Hills that overlooked the river,

267
00:14:14.661 --> 00:14:16.490
making it difficult to were approached by ship.

268
00:14:16.590 --> 00:14:19.730
The lands of the north was an impossible maze of swamps rivers and BAS,

269
00:14:19.731 --> 00:14:23.810
and the Confederates had about 30,000 troops Garrison there under the command of

270
00:14:23.811 --> 00:14:26.330
general, John C Pemberton, and to make things worse.

271
00:14:26.330 --> 00:14:29.730
Grant's army was on the opposite side of the river. As the city, initially,

272
00:14:29.731 --> 00:14:33.570
nothing grant tried worked. He attempted to dig canals, traverse, bios,

273
00:14:33.690 --> 00:14:37.640
and other attempts to get his army close enough city without exposing it to the

274
00:14:37.730 --> 00:14:40.680
forts guns. Eventually he decided on a bold strategy.

275
00:14:40.780 --> 00:14:44.320
He would March his army down south of Vicksburg, cross the river there,

276
00:14:44.500 --> 00:14:48.880
and then March north to attack Vicksburg from the east to do it Admiral Porter's

277
00:14:48.881 --> 00:14:52.760
gunboats needed to brave Vicksburg's defenses to be in a position to ferry

278
00:14:53.280 --> 00:14:55.520
grants army across the river. On April the 16th,

279
00:14:55.700 --> 00:14:59.480
10 boats made the attempt Admiral Porter saw that the Confederate shells were

280
00:14:59.720 --> 00:15:00.760
hitting the tops of his ship.

281
00:15:00.761 --> 00:15:03.600
So he maneuvered them as close to the shore on the same side,

282
00:15:03.601 --> 00:15:06.400
as Vicksburg as he could grant watched in satisfaction.

283
00:15:06.640 --> 00:15:09.560
As the majority of the shells flew harmlessly overhead and missed the boats.

284
00:15:09.560 --> 00:15:11.190
Only one out of the 10 boats,

285
00:15:11.191 --> 00:15:15.390
didn't make it six more boats went past Vicksburg on April the 22nd. Again,

286
00:15:15.740 --> 00:15:19.830
only one of them was destroyed on April the 29th grants army started crossing

287
00:15:19.831 --> 00:15:21.870
the Mississippi over the course of the next three weeks.

288
00:15:22.010 --> 00:15:25.550
Grants waged a brilliant campaign out maneuvering his Confederate opponents and

289
00:15:25.551 --> 00:15:29.830
preventing Garrison Vicksburg from being reinforced then defeated Penton's army

290
00:15:29.850 --> 00:15:33.020
at the battle of champion hill, his army surrounding Vicksburg.

291
00:15:33.021 --> 00:15:36.540
And after two assaults failed to carry the city. He settled in for a siege.

292
00:15:36.541 --> 00:15:37.540
Finally on July,

293
00:15:37.541 --> 00:15:41.140
the fourth Pemberton was forced to surrender the city and its Garrison of 20,000

294
00:15:41.240 --> 00:15:41.520
men,

295
00:15:41.520 --> 00:15:44.940
but it was just one day after Rotty Lee's army had been defeated at Gettysburg

296
00:15:44.960 --> 00:15:48.660
and most people received the news of both battles at the same time causing

297
00:15:48.661 --> 00:15:51.460
jubilation in the north and despair in the south Graham was,

298
00:15:51.530 --> 00:15:55.050
is now promoted to command of all the armies in the Western theater of war and

299
00:15:55.170 --> 00:15:59.210
was sent a deal with another pressing situation in Tennessee in September, 1863,

300
00:15:59.230 --> 00:16:01.530
the army of the Cumberlands commanded by William Rose.

301
00:16:01.970 --> 00:16:05.890
Crans had been defeated by Confederate general Brax brag at the battle of chick

302
00:16:06.370 --> 00:16:08.650
Maga. Rose cran had retreated to the city of Chattanooga,

303
00:16:08.651 --> 00:16:11.330
followed by brag who put the city under siege,

304
00:16:11.850 --> 00:16:15.240
grot went Chatanooga with all available forces to break the seed and to defeat

305
00:16:15.560 --> 00:16:18.800
brag. It was here that grant found himself opposed by his old friends,

306
00:16:18.850 --> 00:16:22.520
James Long street for the first time long street had been serving in Robert E

307
00:16:22.530 --> 00:16:23.680
Lee's army in the east,

308
00:16:23.780 --> 00:16:28.000
but was sent to Tennessee to reinforce brag and was now one of brags tenants

309
00:16:28.220 --> 00:16:28.641
grants,

310
00:16:28.641 --> 00:16:32.000
never one for defensive warfare sent his army out to the trenches to attack

311
00:16:32.050 --> 00:16:36.310
brags for horses in two battles on November the 24th and the 21st grant defeated

312
00:16:36.750 --> 00:16:40.350
brag first at lookout mountain. And then at missionary Ridge routing,

313
00:16:40.450 --> 00:16:42.270
the Confederates with heavy losses

314
00:16:48.790 --> 00:16:52.230
Grant was now the union's most successful general. And in March,

315
00:16:52.230 --> 00:16:53.500
1864 Lincoln called of Washington.

316
00:16:53.640 --> 00:16:57.340
He promoted grant to command all union armies with the rank of Lieutenant

317
00:16:57.341 --> 00:16:57.980
general,

318
00:16:57.980 --> 00:17:01.620
a rank that was lost held by George Washington grant decided that the best way

319
00:17:01.621 --> 00:17:04.340
to win the war was to overwhelm the Confederacy. Militarily.

320
00:17:04.600 --> 00:17:08.180
The rebels had grown skilled managing the limited resources they had available

321
00:17:08.181 --> 00:17:11.460
shifting troops from one theater to another as needed grant,

322
00:17:11.700 --> 00:17:14.730
proposed five simultaneous attacks on parts of the Confederacy,

323
00:17:14.731 --> 00:17:17.810
which would prevent the various Confederate forces from reinforcing each.

324
00:17:17.811 --> 00:17:21.650
Other of these two were especially crucial in the west William T.

325
00:17:21.650 --> 00:17:24.930
Sherman Grant's friend and trusted subordinate who had succeeded grant as

326
00:17:24.931 --> 00:17:28.530
commander of the Western theater would invade Georgia and captured the important

327
00:17:28.531 --> 00:17:29.364
city of Atlanta,

328
00:17:29.590 --> 00:17:33.210
but all eyes were on the Eastern theater where the army of the Patoma act

329
00:17:33.211 --> 00:17:34.760
commanded by or Mead,

330
00:17:34.780 --> 00:17:39.560
but overseen by grants would take on Robert E Lee's army of Northern Virginia.

331
00:17:39.740 --> 00:17:40.600
For the last two years,

332
00:17:41.040 --> 00:17:43.680
Lee had made fools out of one union commander after another.

333
00:17:43.740 --> 00:17:47.440
He had consistently out flanked and out fought the army of the Potoma actor.

334
00:17:47.660 --> 00:17:51.920
The point that his name was spoken with reverence in the south and with fear in

335
00:17:51.921 --> 00:17:56.080
the north, the stories about him took on an almost mythical quality.

336
00:17:56.230 --> 00:18:00.680
Some said he couldn't be defeated in battle and that he was divinely inspired

337
00:18:00.850 --> 00:18:02.560
grant. However, wasn't impressed.

338
00:18:02.740 --> 00:18:06.040
He crossed the rapid down river and first encountered at the battle of the

339
00:18:06.041 --> 00:18:10.710
wilderness on may the fifth as with most of the civil war casualties were

340
00:18:11.020 --> 00:18:11.690
appalling,

341
00:18:11.690 --> 00:18:16.350
but rather than retreat as his predecessors had done after a major battle grants

342
00:18:16.351 --> 00:18:17.350
attempted to move around,

343
00:18:17.560 --> 00:18:21.590
Lee's left flag trying to cut his army off from Richmond's the Confederate

344
00:18:21.591 --> 00:18:23.390
capital in the Army's base of supply.

345
00:18:23.420 --> 00:18:27.390
What followed was a series of bloody battles called the Overland campaign grants

346
00:18:27.391 --> 00:18:31.020
systematically worked his way deeper into Virginia engagingly all the way.

347
00:18:31.110 --> 00:18:34.300
Grant suffered 55,000 casualties to Lee, 35,000,

348
00:18:34.480 --> 00:18:38.420
but Lee could hardly afford to replace the money lost while grant had seemingly

349
00:18:38.620 --> 00:18:42.140
infinite reinforcement at his disposal after almost two months of continuous

350
00:18:42.340 --> 00:18:46.100
fighting grant had Lee's army penned up outside the crucial rail Harbor of

351
00:18:46.101 --> 00:18:50.370
Petersburg, not far from Richmond grant dug trenches and settled in for a siege.

352
00:18:50.510 --> 00:18:54.250
He knew that he had Lee where he wanted him. It was just a matter of time,

353
00:18:54.770 --> 00:18:58.410
but time wasn't something that grants and the union army had 1864 was a

354
00:18:58.411 --> 00:19:01.970
presidential election year. And with the war bogged down into the slaughter,

355
00:19:02.000 --> 00:19:03.210
growing worse every day,

356
00:19:03.690 --> 00:19:06.730
that seemed a real chance that Abraham Lincoln would lose his bid for

357
00:19:06.731 --> 00:19:07.850
reelection. His opponent,

358
00:19:08.730 --> 00:19:11.760
George McLean was angry that Lincoln had forced amount of the army and pledged

359
00:19:11.761 --> 00:19:14.920
that if elected, he would end the war by any means necessary,

360
00:19:14.990 --> 00:19:18.320
including signing a peace deal with the Confederates that allowed them to keep

361
00:19:18.321 --> 00:19:19.240
their separate country.

362
00:19:19.500 --> 00:19:23.360
It would also condemn the millions of slaves freed by Lincoln's emancipation

363
00:19:23.361 --> 00:19:27.720
proclamation to a return to grant was being called to butcher in the Northern

364
00:19:27.730 --> 00:19:30.480
press because of the high casualties the army had suffered,

365
00:19:30.710 --> 00:19:34.390
but in the Overland campaign, particularly in battles, such as cold Harbor,

366
00:19:34.620 --> 00:19:38.990
when the union suffered 13,000 casualties to the Confederacy, 5,000,

367
00:19:39.250 --> 00:19:42.950
the bottom line was that the union needed to make real progress in the war

368
00:19:43.130 --> 00:19:46.910
before the election in November or everything there had fought for might come to

369
00:19:46.911 --> 00:19:47.744
nothing.

370
00:19:47.790 --> 00:19:51.700
Salvation came in the form of general Sherman after a bloody campaign ins of his

371
00:19:51.701 --> 00:19:54.620
own Sherman captured the city of Atlanta in September,

372
00:19:54.840 --> 00:19:58.020
as the Confederates left the city, they attempted to burn military supplies,

373
00:19:58.021 --> 00:20:01.500
but the fire spread outta control, ands burns much of the city to the ground.

374
00:20:01.650 --> 00:20:05.140
This victory extensively covered by Julin Northern newspapers,

375
00:20:05.141 --> 00:20:07.940
practically guaranteed Lincoln's reelection Sherman,

376
00:20:07.941 --> 00:20:09.260
then marched on the city of Savannah,

377
00:20:09.261 --> 00:20:13.890
destroying everything in hiss path and early example of modern total war tearing

378
00:20:13.910 --> 00:20:17.210
the guts out the Confederacy as he marched his army to the sea,

379
00:20:17.211 --> 00:20:21.010
and then northwards through the Carolinas. Meanwhile, back in Petersburg,

380
00:20:21.120 --> 00:20:25.370
Granton Lee's armies said Doug miles of trenches in a scene that served as a

381
00:20:25.371 --> 00:20:28.010
prelude to the Western front of world war I, 50 years later,

382
00:20:28.220 --> 00:20:31.890
grant patiently extended his lines, stretching Lee's army thinner and thinner.

383
00:20:32.010 --> 00:20:34.600
And until by the end of March, it was a breaking point on April.

384
00:20:34.601 --> 00:20:38.160
The second grant ordered an assault that captured Petersburg and forced Lee to

385
00:20:38.161 --> 00:20:39.040
abandon Richmond,

386
00:20:39.170 --> 00:20:43.800
which was captured the very next day grant chase Lee for another week before Lee

387
00:20:44.040 --> 00:20:48.440
realized the game was up at AMAs on April the ninth Lee surrendered to grant for

388
00:20:48.441 --> 00:20:51.080
all intents and purposes, the civil war was over

389
00:20:57.540 --> 00:20:58.480
On April the 14th,

390
00:20:58.550 --> 00:21:01.440
five days after the surrender of Lee grants and his wife were supposed to

391
00:21:01.441 --> 00:21:05.360
accompany the Lincolns to Ford's theater in the evening that ultimately declines

392
00:21:05.361 --> 00:21:07.750
the invitation in favor were spending time with his children.

393
00:21:08.010 --> 00:21:09.950
The grants were in Philadelphia that night,

394
00:21:09.951 --> 00:21:13.990
when he received word that Lincoln had been shot by an assassin for the rest of

395
00:21:13.991 --> 00:21:17.310
his life, he would feel guilty that he wasn't there to protect his president,

396
00:21:17.410 --> 00:21:21.710
who he called the greatest man I've ever known most historians agree. However,

397
00:21:22.030 --> 00:21:25.070
the, if grants had been with Lincoln that night it's likely grants would've been

398
00:21:25.071 --> 00:21:29.580
killed two as the commanding general was targeted by booth group and he disliked

399
00:21:29.581 --> 00:21:30.620
carrying weapons. Anyway,

400
00:21:30.840 --> 00:21:34.260
grants as commanding general at the army was now responsible for overseeing the

401
00:21:34.380 --> 00:21:36.380
military occupation of the south. During reconstruction.

402
00:21:36.760 --> 00:21:40.420
He found in Andrew Johnson a much more difficult president to deal with than

403
00:21:40.421 --> 00:21:43.580
Lincoln Johnson wanted to end reconstruction as quickly as possible.

404
00:21:43.730 --> 00:21:47.810
Even if that meant undoing the gains made by African Americans after the a of

405
00:21:47.811 --> 00:21:51.570
slavery Johnson fought with Congress and with his own cabinets and was impeached

406
00:21:51.590 --> 00:21:53.810
by the house of representatives in 1868,

407
00:21:53.830 --> 00:21:56.650
coming very close to being removed from office grant.

408
00:21:56.651 --> 00:22:01.090
Meanwhile was a national hero in the darling of the Republican party. In 1868,

409
00:22:01.091 --> 00:22:04.690
he was nominated by the Republicans for presidents and office. He hadn't sought,

410
00:22:04.750 --> 00:22:07.890
but wasn't going to turn down either. He won in a landslide.

411
00:22:08.040 --> 00:22:10.160
He took office in March, 1869,

412
00:22:10.230 --> 00:22:12.600
like many generals who go on to become politicians.

413
00:22:12.960 --> 00:22:16.080
Graham found the qualities that benefited him in the army were detrimental to

414
00:22:16.081 --> 00:22:19.000
him in the political arena. The military is an autocracy.

415
00:22:19.100 --> 00:22:22.400
The generals give orders than the soldiers of bay, but in politics,

416
00:22:22.401 --> 00:22:25.920
leaders must be masters of persuasion. And in the aftermath of the war,

417
00:22:26.040 --> 00:22:27.920
opinions could not have been more divided.

418
00:22:27.970 --> 00:22:31.390
Recon action would dominate Grant's time. As president grant was determined,

419
00:22:31.550 --> 00:22:33.630
you continued the Republican policy of reconstruction,

420
00:22:33.640 --> 00:22:36.870
which included continuing occupation of the south by federal troops,

421
00:22:36.871 --> 00:22:41.030
promoting organizations for newly freed slaves like the Freedman's bureau and

422
00:22:41.260 --> 00:22:44.830
overall attempting to Disman all the antebellum power structure in the south

423
00:22:45.070 --> 00:22:47.230
that had promoted the idea of Southern nationalism,

424
00:22:47.370 --> 00:22:51.420
but he faced opposition from over variety of sources in the south ex Confederate

425
00:22:51.421 --> 00:22:52.540
soldiers formed secret groups,

426
00:22:52.541 --> 00:22:56.620
including the KU Klux Klan to terrify African Americans and whites who helped

427
00:22:56.621 --> 00:23:00.900
them or supported the Republicans with threats of violence that often turned

428
00:23:00.901 --> 00:23:02.340
bloody seeing in the clan.

429
00:23:02.360 --> 00:23:05.940
The possibility of renewed fighting in the south grant was determined to stop

430
00:23:05.941 --> 00:23:06.160
them.

431
00:23:06.160 --> 00:23:09.300
He established the department of justice as a federal cabinet department and

432
00:23:09.570 --> 00:23:13.370
charged as attorney general with prosecuting the Klan Congress passed the third

433
00:23:13.371 --> 00:23:15.130
enforcement act in 1871,

434
00:23:15.131 --> 00:23:19.090
which gave the president broad powers in combating the white supremacist groups

435
00:23:19.190 --> 00:23:21.330
in the south. By the end of Grant's first time,

436
00:23:21.350 --> 00:23:23.490
the Klan had been effectively destroyed,

437
00:23:23.491 --> 00:23:27.610
and wouldn't be seen again in America for almost 50 years in order to accomplish

438
00:23:27.611 --> 00:23:31.560
his political ends grant was forced to ally himself off with politicians like

439
00:23:31.561 --> 00:23:32.394
Simon, Cameron,

440
00:23:32.420 --> 00:23:36.680
and Roscoe Conlan senators who were more interested in how they could personally

441
00:23:36.681 --> 00:23:40.520
benefit from the Machin nations of authors than actually helping people.

442
00:23:40.610 --> 00:23:44.440
These politicians known as spoils men or Starwars SILS,

443
00:23:44.600 --> 00:23:47.920
an elaborate system of patronage that filled the ranks of federal government

444
00:23:47.921 --> 00:23:49.440
jobs with political favorites.

445
00:23:49.500 --> 00:23:54.360
The system was wildly corrupt filled with countless tales of bribery,

446
00:23:55.000 --> 00:23:57.880
grafts grants Alliance with the Starwars caused a faction of the Republican

447
00:23:57.930 --> 00:24:01.080
party, the liberal Republicans to break with the rest of the party.

448
00:24:01.180 --> 00:24:05.350
As they believed grants, entire administration was corrupt, a wanted reform,

449
00:24:05.351 --> 00:24:07.030
further they opposed grants,

450
00:24:07.031 --> 00:24:09.630
reconstruction policies and wanted the troops out of the south.

451
00:24:09.700 --> 00:24:13.070
They joined with the Democrats who weren't so interested in reform,

452
00:24:13.550 --> 00:24:18.070
but did oppose reconstruction. Nonetheless grant was easily reelected in 1872.

453
00:24:18.350 --> 00:24:21.390
A lot of things went wrong all at once for grant. During a second term,

454
00:24:21.570 --> 00:24:25.260
the economy collapsed very suddenly in 1873 as railroad dark,

455
00:24:25.261 --> 00:24:27.180
suddenly plummeted and investors panicked.

456
00:24:27.520 --> 00:24:31.420
The administration was beset by scandal. Gran was not personally corrupt,

457
00:24:31.480 --> 00:24:33.660
but he had a bad habit of trusting his associates,

458
00:24:33.661 --> 00:24:37.540
especially former military colleagues who were corruption was eventually found

459
00:24:37.600 --> 00:24:38.940
in seven federal departments.

460
00:24:38.960 --> 00:24:43.100
Things came to a head in 1875 when the so-called whiskey ring was exposed.

461
00:24:43.460 --> 00:24:46.490
Whiskey distillers had been working with treasury to cheat the federal

462
00:24:46.491 --> 00:24:50.290
governments out of distillation taxes and splitting the proceeds.

463
00:24:50.650 --> 00:24:53.450
The string of government officers were indicted in the investigation,

464
00:24:53.451 --> 00:24:56.970
including Orville Bako, the president's private secretary,

465
00:24:57.070 --> 00:25:00.690
the scandals caused grants administration to lose most of its credibility and

466
00:25:00.770 --> 00:25:03.730
combined with the economic depression and growing frustration over

467
00:25:03.731 --> 00:25:04.564
reconstruction.

468
00:25:04.750 --> 00:25:09.400
It led to a government I as the 1876 selection approached grant initially

469
00:25:09.401 --> 00:25:11.960
explored the idea of running for a third term as presidents,

470
00:25:11.961 --> 00:25:13.280
but ever since George Washington,

471
00:25:13.420 --> 00:25:17.080
an unofficial tradition of a president not serving more than two terms was

472
00:25:17.360 --> 00:25:21.080
considered almost SACS acted in Washington and grant had few supporters within

473
00:25:21.100 --> 00:25:22.720
the Republican party, your Congress,

474
00:25:23.020 --> 00:25:25.840
he eventually decided against running again in 1876,

475
00:25:26.100 --> 00:25:30.710
the was shrouded in controversy and was only settled after a backroom compromise

476
00:25:30.950 --> 00:25:34.710
gave Republican candidate Rutherford behave the presidency in return for the

477
00:25:34.711 --> 00:25:36.110
withdrawal of troops from the south.

478
00:25:36.290 --> 00:25:39.030
The nation had now abandoned reconstruction completely.

479
00:25:39.031 --> 00:25:42.110
And all the old Confederate states quickly established laws that made African

480
00:25:42.630 --> 00:25:46.230
Americans second class citizens. The so-called Jim Crow south,

481
00:25:46.420 --> 00:25:50.620
that would for almost a hundred years because of the collapse of reconstruction

482
00:25:50.680 --> 00:25:51.900
and the numerous scandals,

483
00:25:51.930 --> 00:25:54.620
many historians view grants P presidency as a failure,

484
00:25:54.840 --> 00:25:58.220
but he did achieve a number of achievements during his eight years in office.

485
00:25:58.440 --> 00:26:01.380
He established the nation's first national park Yellowstone.

486
00:26:01.480 --> 00:26:05.580
He founded the civil service commission in an attempt to combat the spoil system

487
00:26:05.600 --> 00:26:09.410
so prevalent during his administration in which laid the foundation of the

488
00:26:09.411 --> 00:26:10.730
modern professional government.

489
00:26:10.870 --> 00:26:14.290
He advocated for the ratification of the 15th amendment to the constitution,

490
00:26:14.291 --> 00:26:18.170
which prohibited states from denying people, the right to vote based on race.

491
00:26:18.310 --> 00:26:21.570
And he was a strong supporter of civil rights, especially for blacks,

492
00:26:21.840 --> 00:26:22.730
Jews and women

493
00:26:28.930 --> 00:26:32.320
After leaving office grants and Julia embarked on a world tour meeting,

494
00:26:32.510 --> 00:26:37.320
many world leaders, including queen Victoria, oon Bismark and Emper Maji Japan.

495
00:26:37.370 --> 00:26:38.480
After two and a half years,

496
00:26:38.540 --> 00:26:42.520
the grants arrived back in the United States in 1879 grants sold political

497
00:26:42.521 --> 00:26:43.840
allies, trying to secure him,

498
00:26:43.841 --> 00:26:47.400
the Republican nomination for a third term as president in 1880,

499
00:26:47.500 --> 00:26:48.640
but were unsuccessful.

500
00:26:48.740 --> 00:26:52.120
And the grants moved to New York city and invested in a brokerage fund,

501
00:26:52.180 --> 00:26:53.640
but his business partner third and,

502
00:26:53.800 --> 00:26:57.480
and ward was a swindler who ran the firm as a Ponzi scheme and attempted to run

503
00:26:57.481 --> 00:27:01.480
off with the money. When it collapsed grants was left painless in 1884,

504
00:27:01.490 --> 00:27:03.350
grant was diagnos is with throat cancer,

505
00:27:03.750 --> 00:27:07.230
probably caused by his near constant cigar smoking. The honest was terminal,

506
00:27:07.490 --> 00:27:11.030
and he worried about leaving Julia without any money to live on. After he died,

507
00:27:11.220 --> 00:27:13.990
Grant's friends, mark Twain encouraged him to write his memoirs,

508
00:27:13.991 --> 00:27:17.430
offering him a deal that would pay 70% of the royalties from sales of the book

509
00:27:17.730 --> 00:27:21.310
and unheard of amount. At the time he worked tirelessly on the book for months,

510
00:27:21.380 --> 00:27:23.380
despite failing health and extreme pain.

511
00:27:23.560 --> 00:27:27.580
He finished the manuscript in July of 1885 and only a few days later on July,

512
00:27:27.581 --> 00:27:31.700
the 23rd, 1885 UN S grant died at the age of 63,

513
00:27:31.840 --> 00:27:35.180
his funeral in New York city, drone estimated 1.5 million people,

514
00:27:35.250 --> 00:27:37.860
including many veterans of the war on both sides.

515
00:27:38.080 --> 00:27:41.180
He was buried in a temporary tomb in Riverside park. And 12 years later,

516
00:27:41.340 --> 00:27:44.730
a permanent Memorial Grant's tomb was finished and his remains moved there

517
00:27:44.731 --> 00:27:46.850
joined by Julia in 1902.

518
00:27:47.030 --> 00:27:50.330
She had lived the rest of her life on the proceeds from her husband's memoirs,

519
00:27:50.420 --> 00:27:55.050
about $450,000, almost 13 million in today's money

520
00:28:01.270 --> 00:28:03.130
At the time of his death grant was considered.

521
00:28:03.131 --> 00:28:06.880
One of America's almost heroes ranking up there with George Washington and

522
00:28:06.881 --> 00:28:07.714
Abraham Lincoln.

523
00:28:07.900 --> 00:28:11.920
So what happens at Grant's reputation since he obviously doesn't rank that

524
00:28:11.921 --> 00:28:14.680
highly now in the decades that followed Grant's death,

525
00:28:14.860 --> 00:28:18.520
the historical analysis of the civil war and reconstruction began to be

526
00:28:18.521 --> 00:28:21.960
increasingly dominated by pro Southern writers. These historians,

527
00:28:21.961 --> 00:28:25.870
most belonging to the so-called Dunning school after Columbia university,

528
00:28:25.871 --> 00:28:29.550
professor William Dunning took the view that Southern succession wasn't driven

529
00:28:29.650 --> 00:28:33.190
by slavery, but by states' rights and the aggression of the north,

530
00:28:33.240 --> 00:28:34.950
their story cast, Robert Lees,

531
00:28:34.951 --> 00:28:38.550
the hero who humbly defended the honor and property of his home against

532
00:28:38.590 --> 00:28:42.190
invaders, and because every hero needs a villain, they put grants in that role.

533
00:28:42.340 --> 00:28:44.710
They revived charges by contemporary newspapers.

534
00:28:44.711 --> 00:28:48.540
That aunt was a drunken general who threw away the lives of his men and only

535
00:28:48.900 --> 00:28:49.381
defeated Lee,

536
00:28:49.381 --> 00:28:53.140
thanks to BR force Southern whites developed the Dunning school of thought into

537
00:28:53.141 --> 00:28:57.140
the lost cause philosophy that saw the Confederacy as a noble cause and made

538
00:28:57.340 --> 00:29:00.540
Southern generals into heroes and the Northern counterparts into villains.

539
00:29:00.650 --> 00:29:03.660
They used the lost cause philosophy throughout the first half of the 20th

540
00:29:03.661 --> 00:29:08.370
century to justify the continu of discrimination towards African Americans grant

541
00:29:08.371 --> 00:29:09.730
was an unwilling victim of this.

542
00:29:09.970 --> 00:29:13.850
And it wasn't until the Jim Crow laws began to be torn down in the 1960s that

543
00:29:13.851 --> 00:29:17.770
his reputation underwent reevaluation from modern historians today after the

544
00:29:17.771 --> 00:29:21.610
publication of a number of biographies from more objective writers grant is

545
00:29:21.611 --> 00:29:25.770
viewed in a more favorable life by many Americans than he was 60 or 70 years

546
00:29:25.771 --> 00:29:28.240
ago. UN as grants is without a doubts.

547
00:29:28.241 --> 00:29:30.240
One of the most important figures in American history,

548
00:29:30.300 --> 00:29:33.560
he perhaps did more to win the war for the union than any man,

549
00:29:33.700 --> 00:29:35.000
except for Abraham Lincoln.

550
00:29:35.001 --> 00:29:38.440
Keeping the country from being split into two and abolishing slavery.

551
00:29:38.820 --> 00:29:40.920
His military tactics are still study today,

552
00:29:40.921 --> 00:29:43.560
a military Academy's worldwide and his presidency,

553
00:29:43.960 --> 00:29:47.480
or not as successful as his army career still accomplished a number of important

554
00:29:47.481 --> 00:29:51.000
achievements. When you consider where he started with where he ended up,

555
00:29:51.300 --> 00:29:56.240
it is a truly remarkable rise and the United States is better off for

556
00:29:56.400 --> 00:29:59.160
his service. So I really hope you found that video. Interesting. If you did,
