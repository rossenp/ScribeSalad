6
00:00:20.730 --> 00:00:22.750
on October the third, 1863,

7
00:00:22.870 --> 00:00:27.270
a delegation of Mexican aristocrats arrived in trit on a secret mission.

8
00:00:27.610 --> 00:00:28.630
For the last few years,

9
00:00:28.720 --> 00:00:32.630
their country had been convulsed by violence between its liberal and

10
00:00:32.631 --> 00:00:33.790
conservative factions.

11
00:00:33.890 --> 00:00:37.510
<v 2>The economy was in free fall and foreign troops were occupying Mexican soil,</v>

12
00:00:37.730 --> 00:00:41.620
but it wasn't military help that the delegation had come to seek.

13
00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:43.580
They were looking for an emperor,

14
00:00:43.740 --> 00:00:48.100
a European willing to come to Mexico and rule their nation as an absolute

15
00:00:48.101 --> 00:00:51.420
dictator, infer and Maximilian. They found their man,

16
00:00:51.520 --> 00:00:53.020
the brother of Austrian emperor friends,

17
00:00:53.021 --> 00:00:56.820
Joseph Maximilian couldn't have been a more unlikely candidate for the job.

18
00:00:56.920 --> 00:01:00.340
He was a natural liberal unversed in Mexican affairs,

19
00:01:00.341 --> 00:01:05.330
more interested in art than in nation building yet this historical wet blanket

20
00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:10.050
somehow wounds up ruling Mexico as head of an empire in today's

21
00:01:10.051 --> 00:01:14.090
biographics we're lifting the lids on one of these strangest stories in

22
00:01:14.091 --> 00:01:18.410
political history and exploring the minds of a man who tried to make Mexico

23
00:01:19.210 --> 00:01:20.043
a monarchy.

24
00:01:31.990 --> 00:01:36.120
<v 0>It's the fate of many younger brothers to feel they're spending their lives in</v>

25
00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:37.640
the shadow of their older sibling.

26
00:01:37.980 --> 00:01:42.240
But few have ever felt that sense of inadequacy as keenly as maxil

27
00:01:42.700 --> 00:01:47.390
born Archduke Fe ends maxil in Vienna on the 6th of July,

28
00:01:47.390 --> 00:01:51.470
1832 maxil was a mere two years younger than his brother, France, Joseph,

29
00:01:51.890 --> 00:01:55.710
but while most older brothers might be showoffs at sports, say France,

30
00:01:55.711 --> 00:01:59.190
Joseph had a much more annoying claim to superiority.

31
00:01:59.530 --> 00:02:02.030
He was going to be the emperor of Austria.

32
00:02:02.500 --> 00:02:07.020
That would impressive enough if Austria was the small European nation that it is

33
00:02:07.230 --> 00:02:11.860
today, but in the 19th century, this was really serious business back then,

34
00:02:11.861 --> 00:02:15.500
Austria included not just Austria, proper, but modern day, Hungary,

35
00:02:15.510 --> 00:02:20.100
Czech Republic, Slovakia, Slovenia, and Croatia, plus parts of Italy, Poland,

36
00:02:20.101 --> 00:02:24.730
Ukraine, Serbia, and Romania. It was a Europe superpower,

37
00:02:25.030 --> 00:02:28.450
and maxil had missed outs on being the big boss of all of it.

38
00:02:28.790 --> 00:02:33.490
By 23 months still what Maximilian lost in future responsibilities.

39
00:02:33.790 --> 00:02:36.290
He made up for, with freedom. What our friends,

40
00:02:36.291 --> 00:02:38.890
Joseph was firmly placed on a path marked duty.

41
00:02:39.230 --> 00:02:43.970
God army Maximilian was allowed to make his own choices that meant getting into

42
00:02:44.140 --> 00:02:46.360
art into the works of radical thinkers.

43
00:02:46.580 --> 00:02:48.200
By the time he reached his teenage years,

44
00:02:48.270 --> 00:02:53.160
maxilla was as liberal and as conscientious as his older brother was stayed

45
00:02:53.260 --> 00:02:54.160
and conservative,

46
00:02:54.640 --> 00:02:58.400
but any political rift between the two was blocked by huge events that can be

47
00:02:58.401 --> 00:03:02.800
summed up by two little numbers, 1848.

48
00:03:03.100 --> 00:03:07.720
If you've watched our other 19th century videos you'll know that 1848 is the

49
00:03:07.721 --> 00:03:12.040
year that we keep coming back to again and again, and again,

50
00:03:12.380 --> 00:03:15.720
if you haven't just imagine Europe as this rickety house of cards,

51
00:03:16.080 --> 00:03:20.550
barely able to keep standing got that in your lines will now see a gigantic

52
00:03:20.790 --> 00:03:24.150
wrecking ball swinging towards that house of cards.

53
00:03:24.700 --> 00:03:26.710
That is 1848.

54
00:03:27.020 --> 00:03:30.990
That January a revolution in France turned into a contagion of liberal

55
00:03:31.080 --> 00:03:35.750
revolution that swept Europe and Austria and uprising in Vienna got so violent

56
00:03:35.780 --> 00:03:39.940
that the Royal family was forced to flee the city. As liberal belief,

57
00:03:40.190 --> 00:03:44.380
maxil fled with them and stayed fled until the army had pacified the city.

58
00:03:44.900 --> 00:03:48.420
Although the 1848 revolutions were quashed by the end of 1849,

59
00:03:48.730 --> 00:03:52.220
they did have some very important consequences in Austria,

60
00:03:52.560 --> 00:03:56.500
the emperor abdicated and passed the throne to maxillas old brother, friends,

61
00:03:56.501 --> 00:03:58.820
Joseph then Amir 18 years old,

62
00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:03.370
but there were also consequences in France consequences that will have an impact

63
00:04:03.510 --> 00:04:07.610
on our narrative in the near future. After a year of turmoil, uh,

64
00:04:07.611 --> 00:04:12.290
populous laughing stock dismissed by elites rose up to win a supposedly

65
00:04:12.291 --> 00:04:14.770
rubber stamp election and become president.

66
00:04:15.230 --> 00:04:19.810
His name was Louis Napoleon Bonna apart nephew of the original Napoleon Bonna

67
00:04:19.930 --> 00:04:24.000
apart, but history we've soon come to know him as emperor Napoleon II.

68
00:04:24.180 --> 00:04:28.800
It was thanks to him that Maximilian would go from random Austrian Archduke to

69
00:04:28.920 --> 00:04:29.960
dictator of Mexico.

70
00:04:36.440 --> 00:04:39.200
The next few years was spent with friends, Joseph instituting,

71
00:04:39.400 --> 00:04:43.870
a Neo absolute regime in Austria while his liberal brother did what most kids

72
00:04:43.871 --> 00:04:48.350
with too much money and too few responsibilities do travel the world and sleep

73
00:04:48.351 --> 00:04:49.910
with lots of people. At one point,

74
00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:53.910
Maximilian fell in love with a German Countess only to be told by his brother

75
00:04:53.911 --> 00:04:57.910
that she was beneath him and that they had to break off the relationship at

76
00:04:57.911 --> 00:04:58.231
another.

77
00:04:58.231 --> 00:05:01.460
He fell in love with a Portuguese noble woman only for her to die before

78
00:05:01.461 --> 00:05:05.260
friends, Joseph could even get around to shutting that relationship down.

79
00:05:05.261 --> 00:05:06.580
Finally in 1854,

80
00:05:06.581 --> 00:05:09.860
perhaps hoping to knock some responsibility into his sibling friends.

81
00:05:09.861 --> 00:05:13.260
Joseph made Maximilian rear Admiral of the Austrian Navy.

82
00:05:13.530 --> 00:05:17.460
This turned out to be a surprisingly good move while it certainly possible that

83
00:05:17.461 --> 00:05:21.140
Maximilian could have immediately converted the flagship versus into a floating

84
00:05:21.620 --> 00:05:25.530
Oland disgraced, the entire family. He instead took to his new job,

85
00:05:25.680 --> 00:05:30.210
like a boat to water. He was inquisitive and energetic, willing to listen.

86
00:05:30.570 --> 00:05:34.130
A born reformer in the two short years, Maximilian was in charge of it.

87
00:05:34.150 --> 00:05:36.770
The Austrian Navy completely modernized,

88
00:05:37.030 --> 00:05:39.490
no doubt surprised by his brother's success. Friends,

89
00:05:39.491 --> 00:05:41.730
Joseph then made Maximilian governor general,

90
00:05:42.180 --> 00:05:45.560
the kingdom of Lombardi Venetia today, part of Italy,

91
00:05:45.580 --> 00:05:47.600
but back then firmly with an Austria.

92
00:05:48.240 --> 00:05:51.720
But if the emperor was hoping for a repeats of the Navy reforms,

93
00:05:52.120 --> 00:05:55.600
he was about to be sorely disappointed. There are many reasons Lombardi.

94
00:05:56.080 --> 00:05:57.560
Venetia is today in Italy,

95
00:05:57.620 --> 00:06:01.640
but one of them is the Maximilian rules with a hopelessly light touch.

96
00:06:01.730 --> 00:06:04.800
While this was pretty sweet from the perspective of the locals,

97
00:06:04.980 --> 00:06:09.040
it was less good from the perspective of Austria in 1859,

98
00:06:09.440 --> 00:06:11.400
furious at his brother's liberal reforms, France,

99
00:06:11.640 --> 00:06:14.520
Joseph remove maxilla from his post. Only a couple of months later,

100
00:06:15.200 --> 00:06:18.510
Lombardi Venetia had been into what was by now,

101
00:06:18.660 --> 00:06:22.390
well on its way to becoming modern Italy and Austrian rule of the region,

102
00:06:22.870 --> 00:06:24.030
it was over by the way,

103
00:06:24.031 --> 00:06:26.510
one of the guys who helped facilitate this transition of power,

104
00:06:26.700 --> 00:06:28.470
that would be Napoleon III,

105
00:06:28.690 --> 00:06:31.710
who landed a massive French army in the region to stop friends,

106
00:06:31.711 --> 00:06:35.630
Joseph winning it back landing massive armies on other people's countries.

107
00:06:35.950 --> 00:06:40.100
While we are going to BCA Napoleon II, doing that a lot in this video,

108
00:06:40.430 --> 00:06:43.340
after the debacle of Lombardi, Venetia, Maximilian,

109
00:06:43.341 --> 00:06:47.740
retreated to his palace near tri and spent the next few months trying to stay

110
00:06:47.741 --> 00:06:51.460
out of his brother's bad books. This meant concentrating on his new wife,

111
00:06:51.860 --> 00:06:55.620
19 year old, Charlotte of Belgium and organizing occasional trips to Brazil.

112
00:06:55.880 --> 00:07:00.490
But don't go thinking the maxil was out of the Royal loop throughout 1859.

113
00:07:00.530 --> 00:07:02.490
A number of European countries contacted him,

114
00:07:02.491 --> 00:07:06.330
asking him if he'd like to take the throne as leader of their nations.

115
00:07:06.440 --> 00:07:10.250
This wasn't unusual at the time, back in 1832, for example,

116
00:07:10.251 --> 00:07:13.890
Greece had imported a random German prince to be their ruler.

117
00:07:14.030 --> 00:07:17.770
It was kind of just how Europe brought, but not the Americas,

118
00:07:17.771 --> 00:07:20.600
which is what made, what happened next, quite so confusing.

119
00:07:20.700 --> 00:07:24.240
As the 1850s drew to a close maxil got one Royal offer.

120
00:07:24.510 --> 00:07:26.120
It's extremely unlikely.

121
00:07:26.140 --> 00:07:30.120
He was expecting a group of Mexican aristocrats contacted the Archduke,

122
00:07:30.121 --> 00:07:32.680
sounding him out about becoming emperor of Mexico.

123
00:07:33.240 --> 00:07:34.800
Although maxil turned them down,

124
00:07:34.801 --> 00:07:38.080
something about the strange offer must have stuck with him just four years

125
00:07:38.081 --> 00:07:38.640
later.

126
00:07:38.640 --> 00:07:43.350
Those Mexican aristocrats would try again this time maxil would say

127
00:07:43.450 --> 00:07:45.950
yes. So just before we get into the rest of today's video,

128
00:07:46.030 --> 00:07:49.310
I do wanna take a quick moment to tell you about audible.

129
00:07:49.650 --> 00:07:53.630
Now you guys have probably heard of audible year on the internet, so well,

130
00:07:53.690 --> 00:07:54.950
I'm pretty sure you have,

131
00:07:55.020 --> 00:07:59.860
they have the largest selection of audio books in the world bar none.

132
00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:03.500
Now, normally I'm supposed to recommend a book that is related to today's video,

133
00:08:03.640 --> 00:08:05.740
but that's not really how life works.

134
00:08:05.760 --> 00:08:08.860
The history of Mexico hasn't been on my list lately,

135
00:08:09.240 --> 00:08:12.700
but I will recommend something that I'm actually listening to,

136
00:08:12.701 --> 00:08:16.580
which is a bit pulled in the plaque. It's by a chap called Stephen Levy.

137
00:08:16.581 --> 00:08:19.260
He's great. You've probably heard of other books by him.

138
00:08:19.590 --> 00:08:22.850
And the book is a great look inside how Google works.

139
00:08:23.090 --> 00:08:24.850
I know it's a bit random for this video,

140
00:08:24.990 --> 00:08:28.450
but it's a great book that I would thoroughly recommend and you can check it out

141
00:08:29.150 --> 00:08:29.983

30 day free trial link below. And let's go back to the video.

154
00:09:22.950 --> 00:09:24.590
All right. So at this point you might be thinking, well,

155
00:09:24.690 --> 00:09:26.710
why did Mexico actually need an emperor?

156
00:09:26.711 --> 00:09:30.430
Did they just want the fancy ceremonies and stuff? And this is a fair question,

157
00:09:30.440 --> 00:09:33.630
especially since the role of emperor had been abolished in Mexico,

158
00:09:33.970 --> 00:09:36.620
way back in 1824, to answer it,

159
00:09:36.621 --> 00:09:40.620
we're gonna take a quick detail through Mexican history as seen through the eyes

160
00:09:40.960 --> 00:09:43.420
of the third key player in today's video,

161
00:09:44.420 --> 00:09:49.140
Benito ho born on March the 21st 1806 Quez came from rural indigenous

162
00:09:49.350 --> 00:09:53.900
stock in the Oaxaca region. In the days of the Spanish empire as today,

163
00:09:54.140 --> 00:09:59.090
actually rural and in indigenous were often interchangeable with poor and horror

164
00:09:59.400 --> 00:10:03.090
grew up in biting poverty. His parents died when he was three and at 12,

165
00:10:03.230 --> 00:10:04.890
he left home to make something of himself.

166
00:10:05.030 --> 00:10:08.970
But first he had to survive a period of world changing upheaval.

167
00:10:08.990 --> 00:10:10.170
Mexico in 18,

168
00:10:10.370 --> 00:10:14.970
18 was 80 years into its war of independence from the Spanish crown in 1821,

169
00:10:15.370 --> 00:10:18.360
that war was won and Mexico became an actual thing,

170
00:10:18.580 --> 00:10:22.680
but this didn't mean stability. Oh no. Rather it meant chaos,

171
00:10:23.310 --> 00:10:27.600
lots and lots of chaos with a side of mayhem between

172
00:10:27.880 --> 00:10:29.720
1821 and 1861,

173
00:10:29.721 --> 00:10:34.520
Mexico would go through 75 governments and average of nearly two per

174
00:10:34.830 --> 00:10:39.430
year. Still, even this else couldn't keep Benito Juez from rising to the top.

175
00:10:39.570 --> 00:10:42.950
By 1829, he had given up his priesthood training to become a lawyer.

176
00:10:43.060 --> 00:10:44.950
This led in 1831 to his election,

177
00:10:45.050 --> 00:10:48.950
to a municipal council where it became famous for being honest and UN

178
00:10:48.951 --> 00:10:52.190
unpretentious. Then it was onto a position as a judge in 1841.

179
00:10:52.191 --> 00:10:55.270
And then in 1847 election, as Oaxaca governor,

180
00:10:55.690 --> 00:11:00.180
as governor GUAS began to believe Mexican society was irreparably broken by the

181
00:11:00.300 --> 00:11:04.300
Catholic church and the land owning classes. He was so vocal about this,

182
00:11:04.301 --> 00:11:08.740
that when the conservatives came to power in 1853 Juez was forced to flee the

183
00:11:08.741 --> 00:11:12.700
country. Still prepo Mexican politics never sat still for long.

184
00:11:12.820 --> 00:11:16.020
And in 1855 around the time max million was modernizing,

185
00:11:16.040 --> 00:11:20.690
the Austrian army liberals were back in power and asking for jus to

186
00:11:20.870 --> 00:11:22.810
return and be the justice minister.

187
00:11:23.090 --> 00:11:27.650
It was an appointment that would unleash a wave of reform jus authored,

188
00:11:27.850 --> 00:11:31.530
or was attached to bills that broke up larger states that abolished special

189
00:11:31.670 --> 00:11:35.450
courts for the clergy that ended the practice of religious marriages in Mexico

190
00:11:35.710 --> 00:11:40.040
by 1857 was so well respected among liberals that they made him head of the

191
00:11:40.041 --> 00:11:43.640
Supreme court, a posting that also technically made him vice president.

192
00:11:44.150 --> 00:11:47.680
This turned out to be a really important move. Okay.

193
00:11:47.681 --> 00:11:52.560
So let's skip ahead to 1858 over in Europe maxil is messing up ruling Lombardi

194
00:11:53.040 --> 00:11:53.960
Venetia. While in Mexico,

195
00:11:54.300 --> 00:11:58.560
the conservatives are fed up with all of this reform that's going on in January.

196
00:11:58.750 --> 00:12:01.280
They rose up against the government, throwing the president out.

197
00:12:01.460 --> 00:12:04.760
It was the beginning of a civil war known as the reform war,

198
00:12:04.860 --> 00:12:09.480
but it was also the beginning of bonito horror as VP horrors now has a

199
00:12:09.481 --> 00:12:13.470
legitimate claim on the presidency. So he fled Mexico. So Avera Cruz,

200
00:12:13.480 --> 00:12:17.230
where he raised an army to fight the conservatives and fight them.

201
00:12:17.370 --> 00:12:19.590
He did in January, 1861,

202
00:12:20.190 --> 00:12:23.590
horrors forced the conservatives out of the Capitol and had himself declared the

203
00:12:23.591 --> 00:12:24.424
president of Mexico.

204
00:12:24.730 --> 00:12:29.110
But the unrest was far from over the conservative forces were still out there

205
00:12:29.290 --> 00:12:32.630
and the economy was in free fall. It was against this background.

206
00:12:33.580 --> 00:12:35.740
Juez made a fate decision to save money.

207
00:12:35.741 --> 00:12:39.460
He decided to suspend Mexico's debt repayments to its foreign creditors,

208
00:12:39.710 --> 00:12:40.980
along with Spain and Britain.

209
00:12:41.080 --> 00:12:45.460
One of those foreign creditors just happened to be France and Napoleon III was

210
00:12:45.461 --> 00:12:48.460
like the mafia in one very important respect,

211
00:12:48.480 --> 00:12:53.260
forget to pay your debts to him and to make sure that you lost everything

212
00:12:59.670 --> 00:13:03.370
In the end. It was a simple conversation that decided max million strange fate,

213
00:13:03.380 --> 00:13:04.570
while in exile in Europe,

214
00:13:05.050 --> 00:13:09.970
staunch conservative Jose Manuel Hidalgo E za just happened to fall

215
00:13:09.971 --> 00:13:13.970
talking to Napoleon the third Spanish wife &lt;inaudible&gt; casual. Like he,

216
00:13:14.200 --> 00:13:17.880
he mentioned that Benito Juez could be driven from power and France's debts

217
00:13:17.881 --> 00:13:22.840
repaid by a European backed Mexican Monarch U beautifully listens

218
00:13:22.841 --> 00:13:25.560
then went back to her husband and told him of the idea.

219
00:13:25.700 --> 00:13:29.400
It was like Louis Napoleon had suddenly seen the light up until now.

220
00:13:29.401 --> 00:13:32.800
The emperor of France had been contemplating some sort of joint invasion with

221
00:13:32.801 --> 00:13:36.190
Spain and Britains Naqui the rounds and get their money back.

222
00:13:36.330 --> 00:13:39.030
But now he realized he could set up a puppet ruler in Mexico city.

223
00:13:39.490 --> 00:13:41.950
Why stop with just lining his pockets? Okay.

224
00:13:41.951 --> 00:13:46.070
So it's probably time that we delved a little bit into Napoleon II to try and

225
00:13:46.071 --> 00:13:49.710
figure out why he was so into this idea. Born in 1808,

226
00:13:49.711 --> 00:13:53.790
Napoleon II had spent his early childhood as royalty within the first French em

227
00:13:53.950 --> 00:13:56.860
empire, but it'd come of age in the aftermath of the empire collapse.

228
00:13:56.861 --> 00:13:58.900
When his uncle Napoleon, the first was exile,

229
00:13:58.901 --> 00:14:02.780
the French monarchy restored and the Bonna pants all chased out of France.

230
00:14:03.120 --> 00:14:06.140
So you know how Maximilian grew up in his brother's shadow? Well,

231
00:14:06.540 --> 00:14:11.060
Louis Napoleon spent his life in the shadow of his uncle, the actual Napoleon,

232
00:14:11.140 --> 00:14:15.180
possibly the biggest shadow ever cast. Unlike Maximilian though,

233
00:14:15.610 --> 00:14:20.170
Napoleon was determined to eclipse his famous relative throughout the 1830s.

234
00:14:20.190 --> 00:14:23.850
The future Emper launched aborted co after aborted co in France,

235
00:14:24.070 --> 00:14:27.970
all of them badly thought out and all of them failures. In fact,

236
00:14:27.971 --> 00:14:31.570
they failed so badly that everyone thought that he was a bit of a joke.

237
00:14:31.830 --> 00:14:35.090
He was never executed for treason. He was just jailed or exile.

238
00:14:35.350 --> 00:14:36.400
The result was Louis.

239
00:14:36.880 --> 00:14:40.600
Napoleon was still alive when 1848 rolled arounds and able to take advantage of

240
00:14:40.601 --> 00:14:43.960
the chaos unleashed to win France's first ever presidential election.

241
00:14:44.480 --> 00:14:45.001
Not long after that,

242
00:14:45.001 --> 00:14:48.760
he launched his final coup ended French democracy and made himself em,

243
00:14:49.090 --> 00:14:53.640
while he may have succeeded in netting, his uncle's title of emperor.

244
00:14:53.740 --> 00:14:57.960
He had none of his legendary military victories over the next few years,

245
00:14:57.961 --> 00:15:02.800
Napoleon III tried his best changed that there was the intervention in Lodi

246
00:15:03.320 --> 00:15:06.960
Venetia just after Maximilian left the post. There was also the Crimean war,

247
00:15:07.180 --> 00:15:09.600
but there was nothing that would fix his name in the history box.

248
00:15:09.601 --> 00:15:14.350
Nothing that would make future historians go Napoleon. You mean the third,

249
00:15:14.440 --> 00:15:15.310
right? You know,

250
00:15:15.850 --> 00:15:20.550
the best Napoleon that all changed in April, 1861 that month,

251
00:15:20.730 --> 00:15:25.110
the us civil war erupted and suddenly the superpower keeping the Europeans out

252
00:15:25.111 --> 00:15:28.510
of the new world was otherwise engaged almost immediately.

253
00:15:28.910 --> 00:15:32.980
Louie Napoleon began putting diplomatic pressure on Texas toed from the

254
00:15:32.981 --> 00:15:36.940
Confederacy and become a French protected Republic. When that failed,

255
00:15:36.960 --> 00:15:40.860
he fixed his attention on Mexico. We've seen some speculation that the,

256
00:15:41.220 --> 00:15:45.500
the third's end goal was to get a foothold in the Americas while the us was in

257
00:15:45.501 --> 00:15:49.740
chaos. Some have even suggested that he might have been hoping to reclaim French

258
00:15:49.810 --> 00:15:54.450
Louisiana, the territory, his uncle sold to the Americans in 1803.

259
00:15:54.670 --> 00:15:59.650
And what better way to achieve that than by installing some loyal idiot as a

260
00:15:59.651 --> 00:16:04.170
client emperor in Mexico on January the eighth, 1862, 10,000 French,

261
00:16:04.171 --> 00:16:07.810
Spanish and British troops landed in Vera Cruz and attacked Mexico,

262
00:16:08.040 --> 00:16:11.930
despite some initial bad defeats and Britain and Spain pulling outta the fight

263
00:16:12.180 --> 00:16:13.400
by the 31st of May,

264
00:16:13.680 --> 00:16:18.280
1863 Benito Quez had been forced to flee the capital and Mexico was largely

265
00:16:18.370 --> 00:16:21.240
under French control. Not long after on October the third,

266
00:16:21.320 --> 00:16:26.000
a delegation of Mexican aristocrats arrived in Trias to offer maxil the Mexican

267
00:16:26.210 --> 00:16:31.080
crown, the newly reconstituted Mexican empire had just found its new emperor.

268
00:16:37.330 --> 00:16:41.030
What's remarkable today about max millions. Ascensions on the Mexican throne.

269
00:16:41.160 --> 00:16:42.990
Isn't just how unlikely it was.

270
00:16:43.180 --> 00:16:46.550
Seriously take out any one of these parts and the whole thing never happens,

271
00:16:46.930 --> 00:16:51.470
but what a clearly bad puppet ruler, he was from the very get go.

272
00:16:51.610 --> 00:16:55.740
The Mexican aristocrats visioning a medieval star king to protect their land,

273
00:16:55.760 --> 00:16:57.940
the church and crush the liberals Napoleon.

274
00:16:58.060 --> 00:16:59.940
The third was envisaging a pliable idiot.

275
00:17:00.030 --> 00:17:04.340
Who'd allow him to project French power into the new world. Instead,

276
00:17:05.260 --> 00:17:05.880
Maximilian insisted.

277
00:17:05.880 --> 00:17:09.380
He would only take the throne on the condition that the people of Mexican voted

278
00:17:09.400 --> 00:17:10.101
for him to do.

279
00:17:10.101 --> 00:17:13.260
So you can always imagine the rich Mexicans looking each other and being like,

280
00:17:14.290 --> 00:17:18.490
ah, still max maxil refused to budge on this requirement.

281
00:17:18.710 --> 00:17:21.890
So with enough eye rolling to generate its own electricity,

282
00:17:22.010 --> 00:17:24.530
Napoleon III organized a sham, referendum,

283
00:17:24.531 --> 00:17:28.890
rigged the results and then presented them to maxil as proof that the peasants

284
00:17:28.891 --> 00:17:29.810
wanted to in charge,

285
00:17:30.120 --> 00:17:35.080
thus convinced maxil set sale for his new empire on April the 10th, 1864,

286
00:17:35.210 --> 00:17:36.240
there was just one problem.

287
00:17:36.360 --> 00:17:40.800
Napoleon thei sham election hadn't convinced Maximilian and his wife.

288
00:17:41.180 --> 00:17:45.400
It had really actually convinced them like they really thought Mexico's poor

289
00:17:45.401 --> 00:17:47.440
were crying out for their guiding hands.

290
00:17:47.820 --> 00:17:51.400
And that meant they desperately wanted to protect those Mexican peasants from

291
00:17:51.440 --> 00:17:52.273
exploitation,

292
00:17:52.390 --> 00:17:56.760
maxilla and Charlotte have named now changed to Carlotta arrived in Mexico on

293
00:17:56.761 --> 00:18:00.080
may the 27th to cheering crowds of conservative supporters.

294
00:18:00.190 --> 00:18:02.120
They moved into chip pack castle,

295
00:18:02.121 --> 00:18:05.360
which had been redecorated to look like a Royal European home.

296
00:18:05.640 --> 00:18:09.150
A pretend court had been set up for them full of ladies in waiting everyone

297
00:18:09.430 --> 00:18:12.830
expected Maximilian to start ruling like his Neo absolutist brother.

298
00:18:13.140 --> 00:18:17.550
Instead the new emperor of Mexico immediately turned around and not just bit the

299
00:18:17.551 --> 00:18:18.510
hands that was feeding him,

300
00:18:18.770 --> 00:18:23.470
but tore it right off rather than whip the country into solid conservative

301
00:18:23.471 --> 00:18:23.870
shape.

302
00:18:23.870 --> 00:18:28.150
Maximilian's first decrees were to preserve Benito horror's liberal reforms.

303
00:18:28.220 --> 00:18:31.060
This included the breaking up of the church's lands,

304
00:18:31.061 --> 00:18:34.620
the separation of church and state the outlawing of surf him.

305
00:18:34.760 --> 00:18:38.860
You can just imagine the dawning realization of the faces of the Mexican

306
00:18:39.170 --> 00:18:43.180
aristocrats. They'd gone to all of this trouble to replace Benito Juez.

307
00:18:43.280 --> 00:18:47.420
And the new guy was basically Juez but wearing a crown

308
00:18:47.990 --> 00:18:51.170
maxil seems to have recognized the, this too early in his rule,

309
00:18:51.310 --> 00:18:55.770
he actually wrote to wires whose forces were still holding out in the far north

310
00:18:56.030 --> 00:18:59.770
and asked him to come back to Mexico city and be prime minister.

311
00:18:59.771 --> 00:19:02.130
What he basically said was we're pretty much the same.

312
00:19:02.430 --> 00:19:04.730
Why don't we stop the city war? You come back to the capital,

313
00:19:05.450 --> 00:19:09.090
I'll make you prime minister and we can make Mexico into a liberal paradise

314
00:19:09.570 --> 00:19:11.080
together. Counterfactual history.

315
00:19:11.230 --> 00:19:15.600
It's interesting to speculate what might have happened if jus had said, sure,

316
00:19:15.820 --> 00:19:20.120
why not? After all his program. And maxil really were that far apart.

317
00:19:20.300 --> 00:19:23.520
If FARs had decided to throw in the towel and work with the new emperor,

318
00:19:23.670 --> 00:19:28.360
it's entirely possible. Mexico would still be an Emper empire to this very day,

319
00:19:28.660 --> 00:19:31.910
but jus he didn't need to are throwing the towel. By now,

320
00:19:31.911 --> 00:19:35.390
the battle of Gettysburg had been over familiar year up north,

321
00:19:35.670 --> 00:19:39.150
the union was on the verge of capturing Atlanta, the us civil war.

322
00:19:39.490 --> 00:19:43.750
It was nearly over and uncle Sam was gonna be when he discovered all these

323
00:19:43.751 --> 00:19:46.870
Frenchmen and pretend emperors playing in his backyard.

324
00:19:53.610 --> 00:19:57.540
It's arguable that there never really was, uh, H points of maxillas reign,

325
00:19:57.570 --> 00:20:00.940
just a series of endlessly decreasing lows.

326
00:20:01.160 --> 00:20:05.140
His first year in power was spent in metaphorical battles with his conservative

327
00:20:05.141 --> 00:20:07.020
backers over the direction of the am empire.

328
00:20:07.240 --> 00:20:11.420
His second was spent in actual battles with Benito horror's ReMed Republican

329
00:20:11.630 --> 00:20:12.150
troops.

330
00:20:12.150 --> 00:20:15.930
By now the us civil war was over while a full on American invasion hadn't

331
00:20:16.090 --> 00:20:16.171
happened.

332
00:20:16.171 --> 00:20:20.770
Washington had started sending weapons and money over the border to hu as

333
00:20:21.210 --> 00:20:25.410
guise suddenly the Republican forces were better armed and better paid than even

334
00:20:25.430 --> 00:20:26.150
the French.

335
00:20:26.150 --> 00:20:29.530
It was against this worrying background that Maximilian issued his most

336
00:20:29.531 --> 00:20:34.080
controversial decree way back in 1861 when French troops had first landed in

337
00:20:34.360 --> 00:20:35.193
Vera Cruz,

338
00:20:35.200 --> 00:20:39.160
Juez had decreed that any foreign fighters who invaded Mexico would be put to

339
00:20:39.161 --> 00:20:43.760
death. Now in 1865, maxil tried to do something similar on October. The third,

340
00:20:43.980 --> 00:20:48.280
he promulgated the black decree saying that anyone caught fighting for EZs army

341
00:20:48.410 --> 00:20:50.480
would be executed on the spot.

342
00:20:50.780 --> 00:20:55.280
It was meant to be fighting fire with fire instead itself emulate max

343
00:20:55.281 --> 00:20:59.680
millions, entire reign, no matter horror had deployed similar tactics.

344
00:20:59.860 --> 00:21:03.800
Max millions decree was a war crime and everyone hated him for it.

345
00:21:04.310 --> 00:21:06.240
Maxs hated him for murdering their countrymen.

346
00:21:06.440 --> 00:21:09.990
The differentiated him for bringing their military into disrepute nor was it

347
00:21:09.991 --> 00:21:14.150
just soldiers maxil was now also hated by the man keeping him in power by

348
00:21:14.151 --> 00:21:15.350
January, 1866,

349
00:21:15.390 --> 00:21:19.950
Napoleon III was sick and tired with his whole Mexican venture with his

350
00:21:19.980 --> 00:21:23.350
pliable Papa who refused to be pliable with America,

351
00:21:23.351 --> 00:21:26.950
suddenly demanding to know why he was garrisoning troops just below the ball.

352
00:21:27.480 --> 00:21:30.500
So not long after he learned of the black decree,

353
00:21:30.600 --> 00:21:35.340
he decided to cut maxilla loose on January the 15th, 1866 Napoleon.

354
00:21:35.500 --> 00:21:38.380
The third announced French troops would begin withdrawing from Mexico.

355
00:21:38.690 --> 00:21:42.500
16 days later, the Garrison Chihuahua simply walked out,

356
00:21:42.530 --> 00:21:45.300
leaving the Imperial Mexican horses to their fate.

357
00:21:45.680 --> 00:21:49.490
And that was really that for the so second Mexican empire over the following

358
00:21:49.690 --> 00:21:49.800
months,

359
00:21:49.800 --> 00:21:54.250
more and more French garrisons packed up and left leaving town after town wide

360
00:21:54.251 --> 00:21:55.810
open for horror's forces.

361
00:21:56.230 --> 00:22:00.810
As the Republican army swept down from the north gold Dred gripped everyone in

362
00:22:00.811 --> 00:22:02.250
Mexico city on July the ninth,

363
00:22:02.650 --> 00:22:06.170
Colorado left for Europe to turn to throw herself on Napoleon the thirds, mercy,

364
00:22:06.610 --> 00:22:10.560
but Napoleon the third done with this crap. He just refused to help.

365
00:22:10.710 --> 00:22:14.560
Shortly after Karl LA had a mental breakdown and was isolated in a family

366
00:22:14.660 --> 00:22:16.720
castle, she'd never seen Mexico again,

367
00:22:17.240 --> 00:22:22.160
but in the Mexican capital 1867 dawned with EZ is forces practically knocking

368
00:22:22.220 --> 00:22:24.000
at the doors in an emergency meeting.

369
00:22:24.210 --> 00:22:26.600
Maxil was told that he should abate and flee the country,

370
00:22:26.980 --> 00:22:29.990
but still believing that he a voice of Mexico's porous.

371
00:22:29.991 --> 00:22:34.350
The diluted emperor refused to abandon his people on February the fifth, 1867,

372
00:22:34.370 --> 00:22:38.030
the remaining forces of the second Mexican em empire finally abandoned the

373
00:22:38.190 --> 00:22:40.070
capital. They rode to the town of Tara,

374
00:22:40.080 --> 00:22:43.030
barricaded themselves in and waited for horrors as army.

375
00:22:43.300 --> 00:22:45.350
They would not have to wait very long.

376
00:22:51.840 --> 00:22:55.980
The siege of quar was as painful for everyone inside as it was pointless.

377
00:22:56.660 --> 00:22:58.820
Whereas his forces surrounded the town on March the fifth,

378
00:22:58.920 --> 00:23:01.820
and then they simply waited for the inevitable inside the walls.

379
00:23:01.821 --> 00:23:05.340
Provisions ran out. The remaining soldiers were forced to eat their horses.

380
00:23:05.550 --> 00:23:08.340
After that everyone went hungry throughout the siege.

381
00:23:08.620 --> 00:23:12.050
Maxillas said to have remained upbeat, trying to raise everyone's spirits.

382
00:23:12.110 --> 00:23:13.250
It must have been an odd site.

383
00:23:13.400 --> 00:23:17.810
This 34 year old Austrian strolling through a siege colonial city telling Bera

384
00:23:17.970 --> 00:23:22.650
old Mexican soldiers in his bad Spanish to buck up old sport because it's not

385
00:23:22.651 --> 00:23:27.330
ever yet. Iteming to wonder if maxilla ever reflected on his bizarre life,

386
00:23:27.350 --> 00:23:31.680
on how he and Austrian Royal and up starving in a siege,

387
00:23:31.681 --> 00:23:34.600
Mexican town, some 10,000 kilometers from home,

388
00:23:34.900 --> 00:23:38.760
or maybe it simply never occurred to him that his life was bizarre at all.

389
00:23:38.980 --> 00:23:41.080
The siege finally broke on may the 15th.

390
00:23:41.080 --> 00:23:45.480
When a conservative officer opened a gate that where as his army in maxilla was

391
00:23:45.481 --> 00:23:49.560
captured just under a month later, he was sentenced to death on June the 19th,

392
00:23:49.880 --> 00:23:54.680
1867 maxil was led into a white wall courtyard under the burning sun and

393
00:23:54.681 --> 00:23:58.800
made to face a fir squad. At the last moment, he was hurt to shout Viva Mexico.

394
00:23:59.430 --> 00:24:02.760
Then there were several sharp cracks, some puffs of white smoke.

395
00:24:03.140 --> 00:24:07.910
And the second emperor of was no more news and Maximilian's death reached

396
00:24:07.911 --> 00:24:10.110
France on July. The first, just as Napoleon.

397
00:24:10.230 --> 00:24:13.390
The third was making a speech at the world's fair. It caused outrage,

398
00:24:13.690 --> 00:24:18.510
but I mean, what was Paris gonna do? Invade Mexico again for friends, Joseph,

399
00:24:18.730 --> 00:24:22.990
the aftermath of his brothers in glorious death was an embarrassing time as it

400
00:24:22.991 --> 00:24:27.140
was for many in Europe, as it was for many across the Atlantic two in Mexico,

401
00:24:27.860 --> 00:24:29.380
Benito horrors was reelected presidents,

402
00:24:29.381 --> 00:24:33.700
but then spent so many years trying to AMAs near dictatorial powers that he

403
00:24:33.701 --> 00:24:35.820
became as unpopular as maxil.

404
00:24:36.200 --> 00:24:40.460
He died in 1872 unloved with Mexico, still unstable.

405
00:24:40.760 --> 00:24:45.730
It wasn't until the 20th century that he was reinvented as a national hero for

406
00:24:45.731 --> 00:24:46.850
Napoleon the third. Well,

407
00:24:46.851 --> 00:24:50.490
he didn't fare much better captured during an ill advised war against pressure.

408
00:24:50.491 --> 00:24:51.310
In 1870,

409
00:24:51.310 --> 00:24:55.810
he was deposed in a revolution a day later and sent to live in exile in Britain.

410
00:24:56.030 --> 00:24:58.530
He died in bitter obscurity in 1873,

411
00:24:58.550 --> 00:25:01.610
having never escaped his uncles outsized shadow.

412
00:25:01.950 --> 00:25:06.720
The last person in our story to go was Carlota. After a breakdown in 80 in 66,

413
00:25:06.800 --> 00:25:10.560
a former impressive Mexico lived in seclusion in Belgium, forever,

414
00:25:10.630 --> 00:25:14.720
haunted by paranoia. She finally passed away in January, 1927,

415
00:25:14.900 --> 00:25:18.800
nearly 50 years after our husband was executed in a dusty courtyard,

416
00:25:19.320 --> 00:25:20.280
a whole ocean away.

417
00:25:20.660 --> 00:25:24.160
And so we finally come to the biggest question of all was maxilla,

418
00:25:24.260 --> 00:25:28.590
really a significant historical F or whilst his entire life.

419
00:25:28.591 --> 00:25:33.150
Just this fluke of geopolitics pointless rule signify nothing.

420
00:25:33.460 --> 00:25:33.840
Well,

421
00:25:33.840 --> 00:25:38.590
maybe it's a bit of both it's doubtless that Maximilian was only ever really a

422
00:25:38.750 --> 00:25:40.790
bit player in several much larger stories.

423
00:25:40.970 --> 00:25:43.590
The story of his brother's rise of Napoleon,

424
00:25:43.591 --> 00:25:48.580
the thirds hubris of Mexico's chaotic 19th and America, civil war,

425
00:25:49.060 --> 00:25:52.900
but even the most minor characters can still be fascinating in their own way.

426
00:25:53.130 --> 00:25:57.340
They can still elicit sympathy from an audience. And maxillas short,

427
00:25:57.410 --> 00:26:00.540
pointless life has aspects that we can all relate to.

428
00:26:00.720 --> 00:26:04.580
He was a man who lived in his brother's shadow, but for one tantalizing moment,

429
00:26:04.680 --> 00:26:07.500
he managed to step out into the sun. He may have abused his,

430
00:26:07.770 --> 00:26:10.930
his position with the black decree. He may have been a foreign dictator,

431
00:26:11.080 --> 00:26:12.130
lording it over Mexico,

432
00:26:12.630 --> 00:26:16.330
but Maximilian was also however briefly his own man.

433
00:26:16.760 --> 00:26:18.090
When the history books were written,

434
00:26:18.440 --> 00:26:21.290
they didn't read Maximilian brother re Fran Joseph,

435
00:26:21.630 --> 00:26:26.570
but Maximilian the last Emer of Mexico. So I really hope you enjoyed that video.
