1
00:00:00.060 --> 00:00:03.200
<v 0>He could have added fortune and fame, but caring for neither.</v>

2
00:00:03.260 --> 00:00:06.760
He found happiness and honor in being helpful to the world.

3
00:00:07.170 --> 00:00:11.360
Those are the words found on the gravestone of George Washington, Carver,

4
00:00:11.500 --> 00:00:15.960
an inspirational scientist who was once dubbed by time magazine as the black

5
00:00:16.400 --> 00:00:16.790
Leonarda.

6
00:00:16.790 --> 00:00:21.630
This was apropo as Carver regarded himself more as an artist to use natural

7
00:00:21.650 --> 00:00:24.790
things rather than a true scientist cook stove.

8
00:00:24.791 --> 00:00:29.670
Chemists was how he jokingly referred to himself and his research team at a

9
00:00:29.671 --> 00:00:31.110
time of high racial tensions.

10
00:00:31.111 --> 00:00:34.510
<v 4>When he was part of a community that was still heavily marginalized and</v>

11
00:00:34.511 --> 00:00:38.870
discriminated against the talent and achievements of George Carver transcended

12
00:00:39.050 --> 00:00:42.660
all color barriers and were appreci by the entire nation.

13
00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:46.380
And despite all this most simply remember him as the peanut man.

14
00:00:46.520 --> 00:00:49.100
His work with peanuts brought him the most success,

15
00:00:49.420 --> 00:00:52.820
although even by Carver own admission, it was not his greatest work,

16
00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:53.900
but everything he did,

17
00:00:54.160 --> 00:00:57.900
he did with a purpose to help the furthest man down today,

18
00:00:57.901 --> 00:01:02.090
we take a look at the full extent of the career and the legacy of

19
00:01:02.091 --> 00:01:03.610
George Washington, Carver.

20
00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:15.173
<v 0>George Washington,</v>

21
00:01:15.220 --> 00:01:18.760
Carver was born in a small town called diamond Grove in Newton county,

22
00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:20.920
Missouri to date known simply as diamond.

23
00:01:21.380 --> 00:01:24.670
His birth date is a mystery because he was born into slavery.

24
00:01:24.850 --> 00:01:28.990
The exact date was never recorded. It was sometime during the mid 1860s,

25
00:01:29.010 --> 00:01:32.910
but before slavery was abolished in January 18, 65 later,

26
00:01:33.470 --> 00:01:35.710
Carver said that it happens near the end of the war.

27
00:01:35.810 --> 00:01:39.350
So 1864 is generally given as his year of birth,

28
00:01:39.680 --> 00:01:42.430
right from the very beginning, Carver experienced great tragedy.

29
00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:46.740
And we're talking about more than the obvious misery of being born as a slave,

30
00:01:46.800 --> 00:01:50.020
his parents were marrying Gils and they were owned by a German American

31
00:01:50.021 --> 00:01:53.620
immigrants named Moses Carver. His father died before he was born.

32
00:01:53.680 --> 00:01:55.940
And when George was just an infant, he,

33
00:01:56.120 --> 00:02:00.660
his mother and his older sister were kidnapped by Bush whackers and taken and

34
00:02:00.661 --> 00:02:04.330
sold in Arkansas, Moses Carver high demand to get them back.

35
00:02:04.430 --> 00:02:06.810
But he was only able to track down and recover.

36
00:02:06.811 --> 00:02:10.570
George in exchange for a horse afterwards, slavery may have been abolished,

37
00:02:10.590 --> 00:02:14.650
but the boy was still an orphan. Fortunately for him, Moses Carver and his wife,

38
00:02:14.651 --> 00:02:19.010
Susan took George in and his older brother, James and raised them as their own.

39
00:02:19.011 --> 00:02:22.090
George was a frail trial and he was often sick during his childhood.

40
00:02:22.360 --> 00:02:25.480
Therefore he was two weeks who work on the farm with Moses and James.

41
00:02:25.620 --> 00:02:28.960
<v 4>So instead he helped Susan Carver around the home by doing chores,</v>

42
00:02:28.961 --> 00:02:31.640
cooking and tending the garden during their free time.

43
00:02:31.650 --> 00:02:33.320
Susan taught him to read and write.

44
00:02:33.460 --> 00:02:37.280
He showed an intellectual aptitude from a young age and his adoptive guardians

45
00:02:37.480 --> 00:02:40.280
encouraged him to pursue an education. But around the age of 12,

46
00:02:40.281 --> 00:02:42.040
George wanted to enroll at school. However,

47
00:02:42.180 --> 00:02:46.110
he couldn't do that in diamonds Grove because it only had one public school and

48
00:02:46.111 --> 00:02:47.430
it didn't accept black peoples.

49
00:02:47.500 --> 00:02:51.070
<v 0>Instead he traveled to the county seats of Nesha about 10 miles away.</v>

50
00:02:51.100 --> 00:02:53.830
From this point on, he left the kava farm more or less.

51
00:02:53.970 --> 00:02:57.470
He would sometimes return and stay for a weekends. But other than that,

52
00:02:57.490 --> 00:03:00.440
he kept moving from one place to another, to further his education.

53
00:03:00.700 --> 00:03:04.520
It was also in the show that he first started going by George Carver.

54
00:03:04.680 --> 00:03:08.000
And as up to that point, he kept referring to himself as Carver's George,

55
00:03:08.300 --> 00:03:09.060
the Washington.

56
00:03:09.060 --> 00:03:13.600
He added later in honor of a man who played an important role in his life due to

57
00:03:13.601 --> 00:03:16.040
discrimination. Carver had to jump from one school to the next,

58
00:03:16.100 --> 00:03:18.360
before finding acceptance. He even,

59
00:03:18.710 --> 00:03:22.390
it managed to obtain high school diploma after graduating from Minneapolis high

60
00:03:22.391 --> 00:03:24.990
school, then Minneapolis, Kansas from there,

61
00:03:24.991 --> 00:03:28.470
George wanted to move on to college after being rejected by most of the

62
00:03:28.471 --> 00:03:32.470
institutions he applied for Caral was finally accepted sight on scene by

63
00:03:32.590 --> 00:03:36.150
Highlands college in Kansas. But they too later rejected him. Once.

64
00:03:36.151 --> 00:03:38.510
They discovered that he was black, feeling a bit.

65
00:03:39.240 --> 00:03:43.940
George gave up his dream of going to college for a while and instead claimed a

66
00:03:43.941 --> 00:03:44.501
homestead,

67
00:03:44.501 --> 00:03:48.740
which he farmed alone while simultaneously doing odd jobs and working as a round

68
00:03:48.980 --> 00:03:53.020
Chan to support himself. He did this for a few years, but by the late 1880s,

69
00:03:53.540 --> 00:03:55.100
Carver was ready to move on to something else.

70
00:03:55.280 --> 00:03:59.850
He managed to secure a loan from a bank and he left Kansas making his way Iowa

71
00:04:00.150 --> 00:04:01.250
in the city of interests.

72
00:04:01.390 --> 00:04:05.250
He Mets and befriended a white couple called the mill Hollands who urged him to

73
00:04:05.490 --> 00:04:06.570
continue his higher education.

74
00:04:07.010 --> 00:04:08.570
<v 4>Although reluctant at first Carver,</v>

75
00:04:08.571 --> 00:04:12.450
eventually relented and enrolled in a little Methodist school in India,

76
00:04:12.640 --> 00:04:14.490
NOLA Iowa called Simpson college.

77
00:04:14.830 --> 00:04:18.090
The time he spent there had a deep effect on George Carver,

78
00:04:18.110 --> 00:04:21.840
not just from a career perspective, but also from a spiritual one.

79
00:04:21.980 --> 00:04:23.880
<v 0>It greatly strengthened his Christian faith.</v>

80
00:04:23.881 --> 00:04:28.680
As he finally found a place which accepted everyone regardless of race and

81
00:04:28.681 --> 00:04:31.920
made him believe he was a real human being.

82
00:04:32.220 --> 00:04:34.800
Carver studied a multitude of subjects at Simpson college,

83
00:04:34.900 --> 00:04:38.920
but somewhat unexpectedly focused mainly on art, particularly painting.

84
00:04:39.110 --> 00:04:41.910
This had been a passion of his as ever since he was a young man,

85
00:04:41.970 --> 00:04:46.470
but his teacher at a bud did not think that a black man in that day and age had

86
00:04:46.670 --> 00:04:49.110
a chance of making a decent living as a painter.

87
00:04:49.180 --> 00:04:51.870
When she found out that Carver was also interested in plants,

88
00:04:51.970 --> 00:04:56.030
she encouraged him to switch to botany and enroll at the Iowa state agricultural

89
00:04:56.060 --> 00:04:59.070
college in Aimes. Uh, her father taught AutoCulture

90
00:05:05.600 --> 00:05:06.540
In 1891.

91
00:05:06.541 --> 00:05:10.260
George Carver became the first black man accepted at Iowa state university.

92
00:05:10.680 --> 00:05:14.300
Now fully living his dream. He embraced all facets of campus. Life.

93
00:05:14.860 --> 00:05:17.900
Carver was on the debate club, the athletics team. He was captain of the campus.

94
00:05:18.220 --> 00:05:19.053
Military regimens.

95
00:05:19.100 --> 00:05:22.930
He wrote poetry published in the student news were in two of his paintings were

96
00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:26.210
even exhibited at the Chicago. World's fair in 1893.

97
00:05:26.390 --> 00:05:30.810
But of course it was his agricultural work that earned him the most praise after

98
00:05:30.811 --> 00:05:34.890
presenting his thesis in 1894, titled plants as modified by men,

99
00:05:35.570 --> 00:05:38.090
Carver graduated and continued to study for his master's degree.

100
00:05:38.230 --> 00:05:41.970
His professors were so impressed with his work that they asked him to begin

101
00:05:42.280 --> 00:05:43.060
teaching as well.

102
00:05:43.060 --> 00:05:47.080
<v 4>His masters program saw Carver workers and assistant modernist for the college</v>

103
00:05:47.090 --> 00:05:52.000
experiment station, focusing on plant pathology, which is the study of disease,

104
00:05:52.040 --> 00:05:54.960
implants and ology, which is the study of fungi.

105
00:05:55.020 --> 00:05:55.880
<v 0>During this time,</v>

106
00:05:55.881 --> 00:05:59.360
he wrote several papers on his works that were published and they started

107
00:05:59.470 --> 00:06:03.440
garnering him a reputation as one of the countries, leading young scientists,

108
00:06:03.660 --> 00:06:08.240
he completed his master's degree in 1896. Now that his education was complete,

109
00:06:08.760 --> 00:06:12.320
Carver was ready to embark on a permanent career as a teacher and researcher.

110
00:06:12.580 --> 00:06:13.880
He wasn't hurting for office,

111
00:06:14.180 --> 00:06:17.670
but in the end he chose a young institu in Tuskegee,

112
00:06:17.671 --> 00:06:20.830
Alabama that had only been established 15 years prior.

113
00:06:21.010 --> 00:06:25.030
It was the Tuskegee Institute known today as Tuskegee university,

114
00:06:25.290 --> 00:06:29.030
the passion project of prominent civil rights activist, Booker T Washington,

115
00:06:29.210 --> 00:06:33.590
widely influential and respected among the elite circles of American society.

116
00:06:33.640 --> 00:06:37.940
Washington wanted to set up a university that could provide a higher education

117
00:06:38.160 --> 00:06:40.660
for black people without fear of discrimination.

118
00:06:40.880 --> 00:06:44.820
He founded the Tuskegee Institute in 1881 with the help of donations from

119
00:06:44.821 --> 00:06:45.541
industrialists,

120
00:06:45.541 --> 00:06:50.060
such as Andrew Carnegie and John D Rae around the mid 1890s.

121
00:06:50.060 --> 00:06:54.020
Washington had entered the second phase of his vision for his university,

122
00:06:54.021 --> 00:06:58.130
which was to recruit the most talented black teachers and S it's in the country.

123
00:06:58.320 --> 00:07:03.050
Obviously Carver was on his list and he clearly shared Washington's vision in

124
00:07:03.210 --> 00:07:07.410
1896, kava moved to Alabama where he accepted a position with the agriculture

125
00:07:07.411 --> 00:07:09.450
department at the Tuskegee Institute.

126
00:07:09.790 --> 00:07:11.890
One that he would keep for the rest of his life.

127
00:07:12.110 --> 00:07:16.370
You might expect that the pairing of Carver and Washington might be a match made

128
00:07:16.371 --> 00:07:19.600
in heaven, but the two actually butted heads quite often,

129
00:07:19.810 --> 00:07:22.400
those who knew them believe they had opposing personalities.

130
00:07:22.401 --> 00:07:26.960
Washington was a pragmatist to set a goal and trying to accomplish it as fast as

131
00:07:27.120 --> 00:07:27.460
possible.

132
00:07:27.460 --> 00:07:31.400
Carver on the other hands was more of a dreamer who liked to fretted the time

133
00:07:31.401 --> 00:07:34.360
away in his lab, either painting or looking after his plants,

134
00:07:34.780 --> 00:07:38.200
as the director of the newly created agricultural experiment station,

135
00:07:38.550 --> 00:07:41.910
George Carver expected his job to mostly involve research,

136
00:07:41.911 --> 00:07:43.910
which was what he was interested in. However,

137
00:07:44.000 --> 00:07:47.110
Washington also wanted him to manage the farms,

138
00:07:47.111 --> 00:07:50.430
teach classes and serve on several committees and councils.

139
00:07:50.450 --> 00:07:54.710
It was all the bureaucracy and paperwork that Carver loathed. Most of all,

140
00:07:54.890 --> 00:07:57.670
he threatened to quit several times during Washington's tenure,

141
00:07:57.850 --> 00:07:59.860
as president of the ski Institute,

142
00:08:00.420 --> 00:08:04.300
the latter always managed to smooth things over, but he also flat out,

143
00:08:04.301 --> 00:08:06.540
refused to give into some of Carver's requests,

144
00:08:06.541 --> 00:08:08.380
such as giving up his teaching duties.

145
00:08:08.810 --> 00:08:11.420
Despite the adversarial professional relationship,

146
00:08:11.480 --> 00:08:15.420
the two had a healthy respect for each other and always spoke highly of one.

147
00:08:15.421 --> 00:08:20.090
Another Carver would even later rad Washington to his name in honor of the civil

148
00:08:20.091 --> 00:08:23.290
rights leader, besides his spats with university leadership,

149
00:08:23.770 --> 00:08:26.410
Carver wasn't exactly popular with the other faculty members.

150
00:08:26.600 --> 00:08:27.850
When he first came in,

151
00:08:27.851 --> 00:08:31.730
either many of them resented the privileges that Washington offered him in order

152
00:08:31.731 --> 00:08:33.170
to get him to come to Tuskegee.

153
00:08:33.320 --> 00:08:36.610
This was still in the infancy stages of the university,

154
00:08:36.611 --> 00:08:39.450
which did not have a lot of spare money to go around.

155
00:08:39.580 --> 00:08:43.680
Other faculty members had to live two in one dormitory room if they were

156
00:08:43.681 --> 00:08:46.800
unmarried and they made on average $400 a year,

157
00:08:47.020 --> 00:08:50.160
Carver on the other hand had an annual salary of a thousand dollars plus

158
00:08:50.240 --> 00:08:53.520
expenses and got two dormitory rooms all to himself.

159
00:08:59.990 --> 00:09:03.800
Despite the various administrative obstacles that Carver encountered during his

160
00:09:03.801 --> 00:09:04.800
time at Tuskegee,

161
00:09:04.870 --> 00:09:08.480
they did not hamper his effectiveness as a scientist or researcher.

162
00:09:08.580 --> 00:09:12.320
He decided that his efforts would be best spent helping the farmers of America,

163
00:09:12.321 --> 00:09:14.120
particularly in the Southern states.

164
00:09:14.940 --> 00:09:19.030
Carr believed that they would suffer in the years and decades that followed due

165
00:09:19.031 --> 00:09:20.390
to their over Alliance on cotton.

166
00:09:20.690 --> 00:09:24.310
The practice of growing the same crop in the same place year after year is

167
00:09:24.311 --> 00:09:25.390
called mono cropping.

168
00:09:25.450 --> 00:09:29.070
It is a problem because it depletes the soil of the same nutrients over and over

169
00:09:29.071 --> 00:09:30.790
again, and leads to soil erosion,

170
00:09:30.920 --> 00:09:34.830
which in turn will result in much poorer crop yields in the future. Cotton,

171
00:09:35.040 --> 00:09:35.840
for example,

172
00:09:35.840 --> 00:09:39.700
is quite a demanding crop that uses up a lot of nitrogen in order to grow,

173
00:09:39.800 --> 00:09:43.460
to alleviate the issue of monocropping farmers sometimes practiced crop

174
00:09:43.740 --> 00:09:43.910
rotation,

175
00:09:43.910 --> 00:09:48.140
which simply involved alternating between different crops for subsequent growing

176
00:09:48.141 --> 00:09:51.180
seasons so that the soil had time to build up its nutrients. Again,

177
00:09:51.200 --> 00:09:55.300
George Carver was a big proponent of crop rotation, but he didn't invent it.

178
00:09:55.670 --> 00:09:57.770
It had been practiced since ancient times,

179
00:09:57.910 --> 00:10:01.770
but farmers from the American south had no interest in it because they regarded

180
00:10:01.771 --> 00:10:05.850
cotton as the only cash crop around anything else would not have been as useful.

181
00:10:05.870 --> 00:10:08.090
And therefore would've made less money at first,

182
00:10:08.150 --> 00:10:11.850
Carver presented other ideas such as suggesting that farmers use commercial

183
00:10:12.330 --> 00:10:14.330
fertilizer with a high nitrogen content,

184
00:10:14.470 --> 00:10:18.000
or they buy a second use a two horse plow,

185
00:10:18.001 --> 00:10:19.640
which would till the soul deeper,

186
00:10:19.641 --> 00:10:23.200
these suggestions were seen as a bit to deaf coming from someone who didn't

187
00:10:23.290 --> 00:10:25.320
truly grasp the situation in the south.

188
00:10:25.660 --> 00:10:29.360
It wasn't that farmers were unaware of these solutions or that they were

189
00:10:29.560 --> 00:10:31.680
ignorant of the problem caused by mono cropping,

190
00:10:31.940 --> 00:10:35.240
but that they did not have any money to do anything about it.

191
00:10:35.500 --> 00:10:36.790
The farmers that carved, uh,

192
00:10:36.791 --> 00:10:40.590
aimed to help were all poor and many of them were black following the abolition

193
00:10:40.591 --> 00:10:43.390
of slavery. Wealthy land owners gave them parcels of lands,

194
00:10:43.391 --> 00:10:47.390
which they could work in exchange for a set fee or a percentage of the crop.

195
00:10:47.560 --> 00:10:51.630
Their profit margins were raised of thin and even just one bad growing season

196
00:10:51.680 --> 00:10:55.110
could cause them to lose everything and plunge them into crippling debt.

197
00:10:55.300 --> 00:10:59.260
They had very few land rides and were up against a system which was completely

198
00:10:59.261 --> 00:11:00.094
stacked against them.

199
00:11:00.120 --> 00:11:04.060
It was a system of near slavery as one historian described it,

200
00:11:04.061 --> 00:11:06.980
therefore since the land was never truly theirs. Anyway,

201
00:11:07.080 --> 00:11:10.460
the farmers had almost no incentive to care about the health of the soil,

202
00:11:10.600 --> 00:11:13.820
let alone spend whatever money they saved up in order to improve it.

203
00:11:14.400 --> 00:11:18.290
Car soon realized the extent of the issues that plagued to the poor Southern

204
00:11:18.291 --> 00:11:18.870
farmers.

205
00:11:18.870 --> 00:11:23.130
So his research focused on other ways to improve their work that did not

206
00:11:23.131 --> 00:11:26.570
necessarily require any serious investments. In this regard,

207
00:11:26.750 --> 00:11:31.530
almost all the ideas he had while working at Tuskegee were published in the form

208
00:11:31.550 --> 00:11:36.290
of bulletins. He issued 44 of these bulletins between 1898 and 1943.

209
00:11:36.390 --> 00:11:39.360
The first one for example, was titled feeding acorns,

210
00:11:39.600 --> 00:11:43.920
and it simply encouraged farmers to use acorns to fat up their livestock as a

211
00:11:43.921 --> 00:11:47.800
cheaper alternative to corn that otherwise typically went to waste Carver's most

212
00:11:47.801 --> 00:11:50.800
popular bulletin was number 31 from 1916,

213
00:11:50.801 --> 00:11:55.600
which sought multiple reprinting titled how to grow the peanut into 105 ways of

214
00:11:55.601 --> 00:11:56.840
preparing it for human consumption.

215
00:11:57.180 --> 00:12:01.000
It was a list of recipes collected from other cookbooks, magazines, newspapers,

216
00:12:01.140 --> 00:12:02.920
and agricultural bulletins.

217
00:12:03.120 --> 00:12:07.040
Carver's educational efforts did not consist solely of these bulletins.

218
00:12:07.100 --> 00:12:10.680
He still felt that his information was not reaching all of its intended

219
00:12:11.000 --> 00:12:11.161
audience,

220
00:12:11.161 --> 00:12:15.310
mainly because a lot of the farmers were illiterate or simply because they were

221
00:12:15.330 --> 00:12:18.870
not expecting any kind of actual help from an official institution.

222
00:12:19.270 --> 00:12:22.790
Carver decided that he needed a more direct way to bring education to these

223
00:12:22.791 --> 00:12:24.070
people. And thus,

224
00:12:24.130 --> 00:12:29.070
the Jessup agricultural wagon was born founded in 1906 by George Carver.

225
00:12:29.071 --> 00:12:32.870
This was the first step in the moveable school outreach program of the

226
00:12:33.210 --> 00:12:33.840
Institute.

227
00:12:33.840 --> 00:12:38.140
And it was named after New York banker Morris Ketchum Jesser who founded the

228
00:12:38.141 --> 00:12:38.630
program.

229
00:12:38.630 --> 00:12:42.740
These wagons would travel from farm to farm with equipment and instructional

230
00:12:42.760 --> 00:12:46.620
charts and give lectures to farmers on how to improve the quality of their soil

231
00:12:46.640 --> 00:12:50.940
and alternate cotton with other crops approved successful enough that the United

232
00:12:50.940 --> 00:12:54.450
States department of agriculture eventually adopted it for their own outreach

233
00:12:54.451 --> 00:12:55.284
program.

234
00:12:56.770 --> 00:12:57.603
<v 1>I'm free.</v>

235
00:13:00.810 --> 00:13:04.490
<v 0>Praise in order to convince farmers to willingly switch out their cotton with</v>

236
00:13:04.491 --> 00:13:05.150
other crops,

237
00:13:05.150 --> 00:13:09.130
car needed to show them that it was possible for them to make a living by

238
00:13:09.131 --> 00:13:11.650
growing other things. Thus the embarked on a new mission,

239
00:13:11.740 --> 00:13:16.040
which was to research and develop new apple occasions for crops that he felt had

240
00:13:16.041 --> 00:13:19.040
been overlooked. Of course, we all know about the most famous.

241
00:13:19.140 --> 00:13:23.480
One of all the peanut in the minds of many finding 300 uses for the peanut is

242
00:13:23.481 --> 00:13:25.320
still Carver's main claim to fame.

243
00:13:25.460 --> 00:13:29.880
One of the main reasons why the agricultural scientist focused on this Legum was

244
00:13:29.881 --> 00:13:33.720
because the peanut was quite adept at repairing the damage done to the soil by

245
00:13:33.721 --> 00:13:36.670
cotton. Not only did it have MIGA nitrogen needs,

246
00:13:36.850 --> 00:13:40.190
but it also could grow with relatively little water consumption.

247
00:13:40.450 --> 00:13:44.790
As we already mentioned, 105 of those 300 uses were food recipes,

248
00:13:44.791 --> 00:13:48.590
which he presented in his most popular bulletin. They included flour,

249
00:13:48.640 --> 00:13:52.710
chili sauce, dry coffee, instant coffee, chop, soy sauce, mayonnaise, meatloaf,

250
00:13:52.890 --> 00:13:57.340
Salado, buttermilk mock chicken, ma goose, vinegar, caramel cheese,

251
00:13:57.860 --> 00:14:01.340
Fermento peanut wafers, and many, many more. Of course,

252
00:14:01.650 --> 00:14:04.620
that was just the tip of the Pinot iceberg.

253
00:14:04.760 --> 00:14:08.980
Carver also showed that the Legum could also be used to make various types of

254
00:14:08.981 --> 00:14:12.060
feed for livestock plus dozen different types of beverages.

255
00:14:12.200 --> 00:14:15.460
He used it for medicines, such as rut, a tonics and laxatives,

256
00:14:16.090 --> 00:14:19.610
numerous cosmetics, such as shampoo, hand, and face lotions, shaving cream,

257
00:14:19.720 --> 00:14:24.450
soap Pade and Duff cures. The peanuts was useful around the house as well.

258
00:14:24.590 --> 00:14:27.250
Carver turned it into a laundry soap, leather dyes paints, wood.

259
00:14:27.250 --> 00:14:29.650
<v 3>Stains, and insecticide, various types of paper, metal, Polish, diesel fuel,</v>

260
00:14:29.651 --> 00:14:33.050
and gasoline rubber ink, Oleum, Aris, lubricating oil, and insulating.

261
00:14:33.250 --> 00:14:37.200
<v 0>Port. As you can see, the peanuts was an all perp, this practical crop,</v>

262
00:14:37.520 --> 00:14:42.480
but almost none of these ideas really took off after all Carver made no pretense

263
00:14:42.481 --> 00:14:44.120
to have come up with all of them himself,

264
00:14:44.180 --> 00:14:47.160
nor did he argue that they were superior to their alternatives.

265
00:14:47.390 --> 00:14:51.480
That was not the point Carver's goal was to show Southern farmers and the

266
00:14:51.481 --> 00:14:55.000
country as a whole, that it was possible to develop other cash crops.

267
00:14:55.170 --> 00:14:56.003
Apart from cotton.

268
00:14:56.210 --> 00:14:59.480
Given the carvers hundreds of uses for peanuts never became very popular.

269
00:14:59.900 --> 00:15:04.720
It is a little strange that the two are so inexorably linked historians point

270
00:15:04.721 --> 00:15:07.240
the finger at an obscure events from Carver's life.

271
00:15:07.241 --> 00:15:10.080
When he gave an impasioned testimony before Congress,

272
00:15:10.610 --> 00:15:14.430
it was the moments that permanently connected the scientist to the Legum in the

273
00:15:14.431 --> 00:15:17.790
public minds. But then the event itself was forgotten.

274
00:15:18.010 --> 00:15:22.830
So nowadays people remember the connection, but not its origins. Back in 1921,

275
00:15:22.831 --> 00:15:25.870
the us government wanted to place a tariff on imported peanuts.

276
00:15:25.871 --> 00:15:29.830
Carver testified before the us house ways and means committee and gave a

277
00:15:29.831 --> 00:15:31.580
dazzling speech to bought the tariff.

278
00:15:31.720 --> 00:15:34.420
In order to bolster the nation's own growth of peanuts,

279
00:15:34.600 --> 00:15:38.260
the tariff was passed and afterwards Carver became somewhat of a media

280
00:15:38.450 --> 00:15:39.283
sensation.

281
00:15:39.660 --> 00:15:43.060
One more thing that should be specified about George Washington Carver's nutty

282
00:15:43.061 --> 00:15:46.820
career is that he did not invent peanut butter. This might be a common belief,

283
00:15:46.880 --> 00:15:49.460
but it's incorrect as peanut butter already existed.

284
00:15:49.520 --> 00:15:52.610
By the time he started publishing his bullet. In fact,

285
00:15:52.670 --> 00:15:56.930
the oldest references to the salty snack go all the way back to the Aztecs and

286
00:15:56.931 --> 00:16:00.490
the inkers who made a paste out of ground up roasted peanuts.

287
00:16:00.590 --> 00:16:04.210
The first to make modern peanut butter was Canadian chemist Marcella's Gilmore

288
00:16:04.450 --> 00:16:08.250
Edson who patented the peanut candy. He called it in 1884.

289
00:16:08.390 --> 00:16:11.850
The process was later refined by John Harvey, Kellogg of Kellogg, Syria,

290
00:16:12.280 --> 00:16:15.960
or fame. And in 1903, Dr. Arose Straub invented a machine,

291
00:16:15.961 --> 00:16:17.760
especially designed to make peanut butter.

292
00:16:23.950 --> 00:16:25.480
According to Carver himself,

293
00:16:25.580 --> 00:16:29.120
his research into peanuts was not the greatest work of his career, even.

294
00:16:29.140 --> 00:16:33.870
So he never actively discouraged anyone from making the association between the

295
00:16:33.871 --> 00:16:37.950
two, which is why he is still so closely associated with the peanut today.

296
00:16:38.010 --> 00:16:41.070
He didn't mind the fame that he enjoyed in the last decades of his life.

297
00:16:41.071 --> 00:16:42.670
After his testimony before Congress,

298
00:16:42.970 --> 00:16:45.550
he believed that he could use it to advance his causes,

299
00:16:45.570 --> 00:16:49.750
to promote the Tuskegee Institute and to encourage more racial integration

300
00:16:50.430 --> 00:16:53.780
Carver's research into sustainable farming and ended up saving countless farmers

301
00:16:53.850 --> 00:16:54.490
from ruin.

302
00:16:54.490 --> 00:16:58.380
When the bowl weevil ravaged the Southern cotton crops at the start of the 20th

303
00:16:58.381 --> 00:17:02.180
century, this past made its way from Mexico around 1892.

304
00:17:02.181 --> 00:17:05.020
And in just a couple of decades, turned into a major threat,

305
00:17:05.200 --> 00:17:08.140
not only to all the cotton crops in the country, but to the economy,

306
00:17:08.141 --> 00:17:09.660
which was completely reliance on them.

307
00:17:09.770 --> 00:17:14.370
This wave of evil as it was dubbed by the S D a did succeed in

308
00:17:14.371 --> 00:17:16.450
destroying the financial state of the south.

309
00:17:16.590 --> 00:17:19.250
Thanks to George Carver and others like him,

310
00:17:19.350 --> 00:17:21.730
who advocated for crop diversification,

311
00:17:22.130 --> 00:17:27.010
peanut plantation expanded from 500,000 acres in 1916 to over 4 million

312
00:17:27.100 --> 00:17:29.850
acres in 1918, and continued growing from there.

313
00:17:30.250 --> 00:17:34.010
The city of enterprise Alabama even has a monument dedicated to the bowl Weaver.

314
00:17:34.380 --> 00:17:38.520
The first such structure in the world made to honor an agricultural pest.

315
00:17:38.710 --> 00:17:39.720
They Dubbs the insect,

316
00:17:40.040 --> 00:17:44.320
a Herald of prosperity and were grateful that it forced the locals to switch to

317
00:17:44.321 --> 00:17:45.600
growing peanuts instead of cotton,

318
00:17:45.770 --> 00:17:49.560
which triggered a period of affluence in the city. And it wasn't just peanuts.

319
00:17:49.760 --> 00:17:53.440
Although the Legum was car's bread and peanut butter, if you will,

320
00:17:53.820 --> 00:17:57.840
he saw the problem in trying to prevent mono cropping by simply switching one

321
00:17:57.841 --> 00:17:58.840
crop with another crop.

322
00:17:58.841 --> 00:18:01.440
Therefore he also advocated for the cultivation of other plants,

323
00:18:01.510 --> 00:18:05.320
such as soybeans and pecans. He was a big supporter of the sweet potato,

324
00:18:05.380 --> 00:18:06.800
almost as big as the peanut.

325
00:18:07.220 --> 00:18:10.830
He saw many similar he's between them in terms of the benefit they would provide

326
00:18:10.850 --> 00:18:14.270
to cotton farmers and how easy they were to grow while kava wasn't as

327
00:18:14.271 --> 00:18:15.590
imaginative with the sweet potato.

328
00:18:15.690 --> 00:18:18.510
He still found over a hundred uses for the root vegetable.

329
00:18:18.870 --> 00:18:22.150
Some argued that George Carver's true legacy was that of a pioneering

330
00:18:22.170 --> 00:18:23.030
environmentalist.

331
00:18:23.031 --> 00:18:27.510
There is no doubting that the ideas he promoted about sustainability and

332
00:18:27.530 --> 00:18:31.660
self-sufficiency had an a on the world around him, perhaps more significance,

333
00:18:31.880 --> 00:18:35.740
if not more well known than his work with peanuts. In his later years,

334
00:18:36.340 --> 00:18:39.380
Carver served as agricultural advisor to three us presidents.

335
00:18:39.480 --> 00:18:42.700
He counseled Gandy on matters of nutrition and agriculture.

336
00:18:42.760 --> 00:18:45.900
He taught Henry Ford how to make peanut rubber during world war II.

337
00:18:46.080 --> 00:18:49.340
It might be a little hard to pinpoint what exactly George Washington,

338
00:18:49.890 --> 00:18:54.130
Ava should be remembered for. But when he talked, people certainly listened.

339
00:18:54.430 --> 00:18:59.410
He died on January the fifth, 1943, approximately 79 years old afterwards,

340
00:18:59.460 --> 00:19:02.290
there was talk of establishing a national monument in his honor,

341
00:19:02.470 --> 00:19:03.650
but due to world war II,

342
00:19:03.830 --> 00:19:07.690
all such non-essential expenditures were banns by presidential order. However,

343
00:19:08.090 --> 00:19:09.890
a Senator from his homes, state of Missouri,

344
00:19:10.150 --> 00:19:14.800
sponsored a bill to make an exception in order to do honor to one of the truly

345
00:19:14.801 --> 00:19:18.440
great Americans that Senator was future president Harry ES Truman,

346
00:19:18.580 --> 00:19:21.840
and his bill was passed in both houses unanimously.

347
00:19:22.300 --> 00:19:24.360
