biographic

5
00:00:17.120 --> 00:00:19.130
And the Patheon of rock star decadence.

6
00:00:19.160 --> 00:00:22.850
There's one name that showings brighter than all the others combined.

7
00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:26.240
Freddie mercury was the man who did everything by extremes the lead singer of

8
00:00:26.241 --> 00:00:31.160
queen. He possessed a personality bigger or a more flamboyant than even the BAMS

9
00:00:31.161 --> 00:00:34.520
loudest songs. It was Freddy who threw the greatest party.

10
00:00:34.521 --> 00:00:37.340
This side of ancient Rome in new Orleans in 1978.

11
00:00:37.520 --> 00:00:41.660
It was Freddy who turned seduction into a high tempo art form rushing off stage

12
00:00:41.690 --> 00:00:45.830
between songs to bed. Another beautiful man before rushing back on again. Yep.

13
00:00:45.860 --> 00:00:48.650
This showmanship went beyond yeah, hedonism.

14
00:00:48.950 --> 00:00:53.660
It was also Freddy who in 1985 played along evade said so bombastic it's

15
00:00:53.661 --> 00:00:58.040
estimated to have got a staggering 40% of the world's population rocking along

16
00:00:58.041 --> 00:01:00.830
with him. But while his lifestyle remains legendary,

17
00:01:00.980 --> 00:01:04.490
there was another side to mercury. One far more complex than it is on the stage.

18
00:01:04.520 --> 00:01:07.250
Persona would suggest born twinsie and policy parents.

19
00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:11.930
Freddy was a perpetual outsider arriving in Britain in 1964 hands who operate in

20
00:01:11.931 --> 00:01:16.610
a world in which both his ethnicity and sexuality locked him out as an alien.

21
00:01:16.790 --> 00:01:21.200
This is the story of how that outsider went on to become perhaps the greatest

22
00:01:21.201 --> 00:01:22.850
performer of all time.

23
00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:32.510
Fruit bowl Sarna was born on September the fifth, 1946.

24
00:01:32.511 --> 00:01:36.980
He couldn't have seemed more unlike the legendary rock star he'd one day become

25
00:01:37.010 --> 00:01:39.050
the eldest son of two Parsi Indians,

26
00:01:39.051 --> 00:01:42.860
a community of Zoroastrians who'd fled Persia to escape persecution.

27
00:01:43.040 --> 00:01:47.000
His family had its roots in the Bombay of the British empire. Indeed,

28
00:01:47.001 --> 00:01:50.090
the empire was an outsize influence on the family's life.

29
00:01:50.300 --> 00:01:53.730
While his dad was a civil seven working for the British on the African Island.

30
00:01:53.800 --> 00:01:54.590
Zanzibar,

31
00:01:54.590 --> 00:01:58.370
thanks to this family were able to live a life of comparative luxury that home

32
00:01:58.371 --> 00:02:03.260
in Zanzibar stone town came replete with servants into nanny to look after young

33
00:02:03.710 --> 00:02:03.800
Farrukh,

34
00:02:03.800 --> 00:02:07.820
the embar also influenced the boys' education while his parents were committed

35
00:02:07.840 --> 00:02:11.720
Zoroastrians. They sent the boy to Zanzibar missionary school,

36
00:02:11.721 --> 00:02:13.910
where he was taught by Anglican nuns.

37
00:02:13.970 --> 00:02:17.540
It was at the school that the boy was nicknamed Bucky on account of his

38
00:02:17.541 --> 00:02:22.160
overbite. Yes, this mild physical defects, which turn out to be a secret power.

39
00:02:22.190 --> 00:02:26.360
Many years later when his Faruq personality had been left behind Freddie mercury

40
00:02:26.361 --> 00:02:27.920
would refuse to get his teeth fixed,

41
00:02:28.340 --> 00:02:32.060
less doing so destroyed is incredible for Oxford range. When he turned eight,

42
00:02:32.090 --> 00:02:33.500
the boy left Sam's the bar center.

43
00:02:33.501 --> 00:02:36.530
Now independent India to study at an English style boarding school.

44
00:02:36.560 --> 00:02:39.140
It was during his years, that two important things happened.

45
00:02:39.170 --> 00:02:43.190
The first was that Bulsara discovered he was utterly obsessed with music onto

46
00:02:43.191 --> 00:02:47.750
the watch for live his grandparents in nearby Bombay. He formed his first band.

47
00:02:47.900 --> 00:02:50.330
The second was something Bulsara never talked about much,

48
00:02:50.570 --> 00:02:51.860
not even when he was famous.

49
00:02:51.920 --> 00:02:55.550
It was a boarding school at age 14 that he had his first sexual experience with

50
00:02:55.551 --> 00:02:57.320
another boy come 1963.

51
00:02:57.321 --> 00:03:01.270
Bulsara had graduated and relocated to Zanzibar just as the Island one,

52
00:03:01.420 --> 00:03:03.250
its independence from Britain. By now,

53
00:03:03.370 --> 00:03:06.880
the Charles had big name of Bucky was gone replaced by the much less cruel

54
00:03:06.881 --> 00:03:09.490
nickname. Freddie back on the islands,

55
00:03:09.700 --> 00:03:13.210
Freddie Bulsara divided his time between finishing his education and swimming in

56
00:03:13.211 --> 00:03:17.050
stone towns, clear waters. It was a fairly aimless existence. One befitting,

57
00:03:17.051 --> 00:03:21.220
a teenager who didn't yet know where he wanted to be or what she wanted to do.

58
00:03:21.550 --> 00:03:24.520
This is a good Freddy have known. The decision was about to be made for him.

59
00:03:24.730 --> 00:03:27.880
The Zanzibar revolution exploded in January of 1964,

60
00:03:28.240 --> 00:03:31.660
pitting the African majority against the ruling Arab elites and it killed

61
00:03:31.690 --> 00:03:34.030
upwards of 17,000 people.

62
00:03:34.060 --> 00:03:37.390
The ball SAR has fled the violence using British possible itself into the

63
00:03:37.391 --> 00:03:40.420
family. When both India and Zanzibar exited the empire,

64
00:03:40.450 --> 00:03:45.160
this was how Freddy Bulsara lost. Came to settle in England. In 1966,

65
00:03:45.161 --> 00:03:49.000
he was doing a design course in London and feeling confident about a career in

66
00:03:49.001 --> 00:03:49.660
fashion.

67
00:03:49.660 --> 00:03:53.230
It became commonplace to see Freddie strutting along portabello road dressed as

68
00:03:53.231 --> 00:03:57.670
a pirate say, or working in a clothing store, link Kensington in full leather.

69
00:03:57.730 --> 00:03:58.750
Even at this early age,

70
00:03:58.780 --> 00:04:02.590
she possessed a white hot streak of self-confidence telling anyone he met that

71
00:04:02.591 --> 00:04:03.730
he was going to be a star,

72
00:04:03.940 --> 00:04:06.310
even though the bands he was now playing with were milk toast.

73
00:04:06.370 --> 00:04:09.100
Best that confidence still rubbed off on people.

74
00:04:09.160 --> 00:04:12.880
When Freddy strengthened into the cult fashion store Bieber in 1969,

75
00:04:13.060 --> 00:04:15.700
his attitude flawed sales girl, Mary Austin,

76
00:04:15.910 --> 00:04:18.670
the two began dating and within months they were living together in a cramped

77
00:04:18.671 --> 00:04:20.710
apartment, but it would be two other people.

78
00:04:20.740 --> 00:04:23.830
Bill Saraj met around this time who changed his life.

79
00:04:23.950 --> 00:04:28.750
One was a mobi astrophysicist, the other, and Lethario studying to be a dentist.

80
00:04:29.080 --> 00:04:32.290
Their names were Brian May and Roger tanked up along with Freddy.

81
00:04:32.410 --> 00:04:35.800
They would soon form the band that would make them all famous.

82
00:04:41.790 --> 00:04:41.940
<v 2>[Inaudible].</v>

83
00:04:41.940 --> 00:04:44.910
<v 0>Since you were watching a biography of Freddie mercury rock God,</v>

84
00:04:44.911 --> 00:04:47.700
rather than Freddie mercury random dude who did nothing.

85
00:04:47.701 --> 00:04:51.270
You already know how the band is going to pan out, but it's worth pointing out.

86
00:04:51.271 --> 00:04:54.630
Just watching an unlikely prospect queen seemed in the early seventies,

87
00:04:54.631 --> 00:04:58.650
how divisive people found them. One music, journalist memorably, put it queen,

88
00:04:58.651 --> 00:05:02.400
or either the future of rock and roll or a bunch of raving poofters.

89
00:05:02.520 --> 00:05:07.020
The thing was nobody could really tell queen had formed in 1970 the same year

90
00:05:07.021 --> 00:05:10.590
for root ball Syrah legally changed his name to Freddie mercury.

91
00:05:10.650 --> 00:05:13.320
There was a change that Asha did a new public persona.

92
00:05:13.321 --> 00:05:15.930
One more outrageous than ever before.

93
00:05:16.020 --> 00:05:18.660
As Roger Taylor said it was Freddy who instilled in us,

94
00:05:18.690 --> 00:05:23.190
the belief that we had to make people gossip every time and making people

95
00:05:23.730 --> 00:05:26.340
gospel was something queen excelled at on the stage.

96
00:05:26.550 --> 00:05:27.810
Freddie was already wearing Maskcara.

97
00:05:27.840 --> 00:05:32.400
Codpieces leotards already exhibiting his incredible showmanship for a lot of

98
00:05:32.401 --> 00:05:32.911
audiences.

99
00:05:32.911 --> 00:05:36.300
It was too much queen West slated in the music press with Freddy himself,

100
00:05:36.330 --> 00:05:39.750
singled out for harsh treatments. Yet this criticism never seemed to land.

101
00:05:39.930 --> 00:05:42.210
Instead. Freddie deflected it with winking.

102
00:05:42.211 --> 00:05:44.820
Self-deprecation like when he declared of queen,

103
00:05:44.970 --> 00:05:49.170
we have more in common with Liza Minnelli than led Zepplin. At the same time,

104
00:05:49.171 --> 00:05:52.110
the band was solely finding its footing in 1971 basis.

105
00:05:52.140 --> 00:05:56.310
John deacon joins completing the classic queen lineup in 1973,

106
00:05:56.311 --> 00:06:01.190
the group released debut album imaginatively titled queen off the back of this.

107
00:06:01.490 --> 00:06:04.820
They've got a gig playing support for Mott the Hoople UK tour.

108
00:06:04.880 --> 00:06:06.560
Despite this being a major step hop,

109
00:06:06.800 --> 00:06:10.430
Freddie was outraged that he hasn't been given a tour of his own being support

110
00:06:10.490 --> 00:06:14.990
is one of the most traumatic experiences of my life. He half joked in private,

111
00:06:15.170 --> 00:06:15.561
still,

112
00:06:15.561 --> 00:06:19.010
it was hard to complain by Windsor queen were playing their first foreign tours

113
00:06:19.011 --> 00:06:21.020
and while ends up writing their second album,

114
00:06:21.021 --> 00:06:24.080
the even more imaginatively titled queen to,

115
00:06:24.500 --> 00:06:27.110
or they tried and records were barely paying them. A living wage.

116
00:06:27.410 --> 00:06:29.990
Freddie still felt secure enough to propose to Mary Austin,

117
00:06:30.050 --> 00:06:34.040
not long after the band score, their first top 10 hit with seven seas of ride.

118
00:06:34.190 --> 00:06:38.120
So things were looking good as queen headed off to that first American tour in

119
00:06:38.121 --> 00:06:40.940
April, 1974. Again, supporting Mott the Hoople,

120
00:06:41.030 --> 00:06:45.440
but sometimes looks can be deceiving rather than their big breakthrough Queen's

121
00:06:45.441 --> 00:06:50.090
America tour became a horror show when Brian May contracted hepatitis and the

122
00:06:50.091 --> 00:06:53.510
whole thing had to be canceled as the Greek pretend to Britain on an emergency

123
00:06:53.511 --> 00:06:54.050
flight.

124
00:06:54.050 --> 00:06:58.400
It's easy to imagine how despairing that long trip over the Atlantic could have

125
00:06:58.401 --> 00:07:02.990
been bus. If there was anyone who could overcome despair through sheer force of

126
00:07:02.991 --> 00:07:04.220
personality alone,

127
00:07:04.640 --> 00:07:08.150
it was Freddie mercury that summer queen returned to the recording beef for

128
00:07:08.151 --> 00:07:12.080
months ready, works like a demon possessed by some volcanic drive,

129
00:07:12.110 --> 00:07:15.320
working to turn the bands ailing fortunes around,

130
00:07:15.680 --> 00:07:20.450
and this he succeeded sheer heart attack landed like a glitter bomb in November,

131
00:07:20.450 --> 00:07:20.480
1974.

132
00:07:20.480 --> 00:07:25.100
It was the album that introduced the world to the queen sounds to that bombastic

133
00:07:25.101 --> 00:07:28.700
mix of opera high camp and heavy rock as mercury declared.

134
00:07:28.760 --> 00:07:32.780
We found our identity now and we have the feeling we can outdo anyone,

135
00:07:33.050 --> 00:07:35.900
but while sheer heart attack would save the bands commercially,

136
00:07:35.901 --> 00:07:39.230
it wouldn't be the album that cemented that place in music history.

137
00:07:39.650 --> 00:07:43.970
No that all know would go to a single that mercury was now just a year away from

138
00:07:43.971 --> 00:07:48.410
writing a song that has been interpreted in as many different ways as the second

139
00:07:48.411 --> 00:07:51.830
amendment. Freddie would call that song, the Hemion Rhapsody,

140
00:07:51.980 --> 00:07:56.210
and it would be his final breakthrough and to superstardom.

141
00:07:56.480 --> 00:08:00.890
And if you're looking to break through into a stylish superstardom of your own,

142

the chronograph handles start to move around the watch face.

162

176
00:09:55.040 --> 00:09:55.430
<v 2>[Inaudible].</v>

177
00:09:55.430 --> 00:09:59.060
<v 0>The lead up to Bahamian Rhapsody's release was outwardly one of success for</v>

178
00:09:59.300 --> 00:10:01.280
Freddie mercury and queen Shehata Zack.

179
00:10:01.281 --> 00:10:04.700
It turns them into serious players transforming their earnings from a

180
00:10:04.701 --> 00:10:05.361
Dickensian.

181
00:10:05.361 --> 00:10:09.890
Pitons do Scrooge McDuck style volts of cash over night. Yeah,

182
00:10:09.980 --> 00:10:10.731
it's behind the scenes.

183
00:10:10.731 --> 00:10:15.170
Things were significantly less rosy there's 1975 war on Freddy and Mary Austen's

184
00:10:15.171 --> 00:10:18.590
relationship began to fray. Although they still nominally live together.

185
00:10:18.860 --> 00:10:22.340
Freddie was spending more and more time away, only returning late at night.

186
00:10:22.640 --> 00:10:25.460
If he returned to do old Austin thought he was having an affair with another

187
00:10:25.461 --> 00:10:30.350
woman and she was half right. A fiance was having an affair only,

188
00:10:30.590 --> 00:10:34.610
not with a woman. David mins was Mercury's first serious boyfriends.

189
00:10:34.700 --> 00:10:36.200
Although their relationship didn't last.

190
00:10:36.201 --> 00:10:37.940
It was a transformative event for the singer.

191
00:10:38.030 --> 00:10:39.680
Even while the two were sleeping together,

192
00:10:39.950 --> 00:10:41.930
Freddie began experimenting with gay hookups.

193
00:10:42.170 --> 00:10:46.280
It was like a switch had been flipped. Mercury had never been monogamous.

194
00:10:46.281 --> 00:10:49.940
So juicing plenty of women, even while he and Mary Austin were engaged,

195
00:10:49.970 --> 00:10:53.780
but often mins, the singer's tastes shifted as Brian May later recalled.

196
00:10:53.960 --> 00:10:56.630
It was fairly obvious when the visitors to Freddie's dressing rooms,

197
00:10:56.631 --> 00:10:59.270
daunted to change from hot chicks to hot men.

198
00:10:59.330 --> 00:11:03.320
And there was suddenly a lot of hot men around Freddie mercury, beautiful boys,

199
00:11:03.530 --> 00:11:06.290
sort of from all over the world. As a result of this transformation,

200
00:11:06.410 --> 00:11:10.220
it's been suggested by a whole lot of people that Bahamian Rhapsody was written

201
00:11:10.490 --> 00:11:11.960
as a secret coming out song.

202
00:11:12.020 --> 00:11:16.010
Now we don't want to read too much into what may just be a pleasing six minutes

203
00:11:16.011 --> 00:11:17.300
of a Pratik nonsense,

204
00:11:17.330 --> 00:11:21.710
but it's not hard to see how Mercury's in a life might have been reflected in

205
00:11:21.711 --> 00:11:22.550
his masterpiece.

206
00:11:22.610 --> 00:11:27.170
Things finally came to a head with Mary Austin in 1976 with Bahamian ramps at

207
00:11:27.171 --> 00:11:30.860
the end it's parents album night at the opera by now a smash success.

208
00:11:31.040 --> 00:11:34.640
Freddie mercury sat down with Austin in quiet holding tones.

209
00:11:34.641 --> 00:11:37.970
He told her that he thought he was bisexual. According to Austin,

210
00:11:38.000 --> 00:11:41.930
she responded by saying no Freddie. And I think you all bisexual.

211
00:11:42.260 --> 00:11:43.790
I think you are gay today.

212
00:11:43.791 --> 00:11:47.900
This looks like both by Eurasia and well playing wrong.

213
00:11:47.960 --> 00:11:50.180
Although he showed a real preference for dudes.

214
00:11:50.900 --> 00:11:55.150
Freddie would have significant sexual relationships women well into the 1980s,

215
00:11:55.210 --> 00:11:59.190
but it wasn't with Mary Austin anymore. Austin moved out shortly after,

216
00:11:59.590 --> 00:12:02.140
although she and Freddy would remain close friends later,

217
00:12:02.440 --> 00:12:06.580
Freddie would tell people that she was essentially his wife still Boston's

218
00:12:06.581 --> 00:12:07.000
leaving.

219
00:12:07.000 --> 00:12:10.780
Seems to have been the catalyst for Freddie embracing his sexual identity.

220
00:12:10.840 --> 00:12:12.940
He began appearing in clothing that mimicked gay,

221
00:12:12.941 --> 00:12:17.050
bisexual and subcultures in 1978. Don't stop me. Now.

222
00:12:17.080 --> 00:12:21.670
He cheekily sang about making both the supersonic woman and supersonic man out

223
00:12:21.671 --> 00:12:24.490
of you, perhaps in knowing knowledge to his own preferences. Yes,

224
00:12:24.491 --> 00:12:26.350
even as queen turned up the camp, two 11,

225
00:12:26.380 --> 00:12:30.160
even as Freddie began dressing in public as a Castro clone,

226
00:12:30.161 --> 00:12:34.600
he never publicly discussed a sexuality, asked by a journalist to say once.

227
00:12:34.601 --> 00:12:35.021
And for all,

228
00:12:35.021 --> 00:12:39.220
if he was straight gay or BI Freddie simply gave a toothy grin and replied,

229
00:12:39.460 --> 00:12:43.000
I sleep with men, women caps, you name it,

230
00:12:43.240 --> 00:12:46.450
but while his public persona would never make a definitive statement one way or

231
00:12:46.451 --> 00:12:50.560
the other, his private life would tell its own often lurid story.

232
00:12:55.860 --> 00:12:56.693
<v 2>[Inaudible].</v>

233
00:12:56.970 --> 00:13:01.290
<v 0>The 1970s. We years of eye watering access as queen shows got bigger and more</v>

234
00:13:01.291 --> 00:13:02.124
choreographed.

235
00:13:02.160 --> 00:13:06.540
So did Freddy's hedonism fund became something created with precision drugs were

236
00:13:06.690 --> 00:13:08.820
flown specially into cities to be on hand.

237
00:13:08.821 --> 00:13:12.480
Whenever the single wanted to snort gorgeous men were captains steady supplying

238
00:13:13.050 --> 00:13:16.230
Freddie's Liberty inside even appears during shows with it becoming standard

239
00:13:16.231 --> 00:13:16.831
practice firms,

240
00:13:16.831 --> 00:13:21.630
rung backstage between songs to be sexually serviced and then returns a belt

241
00:13:21.631 --> 00:13:22.530
out. The next number,

242
00:13:22.650 --> 00:13:26.940
the outrageous high point of this probably came on Halloween 1978 to celebrate

243
00:13:26.941 --> 00:13:27.930
the launch of jazz.

244
00:13:28.200 --> 00:13:32.070
Freddy rented the Fairmont hotel in new Orleans and through an eye wateringly

245
00:13:32.071 --> 00:13:35.190
expensive bash to rival anything in ancient Rome,

246
00:13:35.280 --> 00:13:38.940
transgender dwarves were hard to offer guests cocaine that was specially flown

247
00:13:38.941 --> 00:13:40.620
in from Bolivia erotic dancers,

248
00:13:40.621 --> 00:13:44.580
suspended from cages vying for attention with naked waitresses while gigantic

249
00:13:44.610 --> 00:13:48.240
nude womens, sprawled elegantly across tables, lighting cigarettes,

250
00:13:48.270 --> 00:13:49.950
glowing and multiple orifices,

251
00:13:50.010 --> 00:13:53.460
beautiful models of both sexes wrestled in a pool of rural liver,

252
00:13:53.970 --> 00:13:57.240
fiber eaters and drag Queens competed for space with a man biting the heads off

253
00:13:57.570 --> 00:13:59.220
live chickens in the expensive model.

254
00:13:59.220 --> 00:14:02.880
Toilets prostitutes of both sexes offered their services for free guns.

255
00:14:03.090 --> 00:14:05.040
Of course, everywhere. As far as the,

256
00:14:05.041 --> 00:14:09.480
I could see where mountains and mountains of drugs, it was mercury.

257
00:14:09.481 --> 00:14:14.400
In a nutshell, a Pratik bonkers brilliance campaigns, not Alyssa perverted.

258
00:14:14.490 --> 00:14:18.540
It was also everything his detractors hated about him already perceived as all

259
00:14:18.541 --> 00:14:20.370
style and no substance Queens.

260
00:14:20.371 --> 00:14:24.390
Overwrought accesses turns them into critical whipping boys bread.

261
00:14:24.450 --> 00:14:26.550
He was delighted whenever critics, but the question to him,

262
00:14:26.551 --> 00:14:31.140
he retorted all true darling where the most preposterous band that's ever lived.

263
00:14:31.290 --> 00:14:36.030
And then on assumes he stuck his nose right back into a handy bag of uncle

264
00:14:36.031 --> 00:14:40.440
Escobar's finest while queen as a whole earns a reputation for access.

265
00:14:40.441 --> 00:14:42.030
It was really Freddie mercury,

266
00:14:42.031 --> 00:14:46.410
who was the mad shooting star burning through the sky is at 200 degrees

267
00:14:46.411 --> 00:14:51.000
Fahrenheit in 1980. This thing settles in a luxury apartment in New York city,

268
00:14:51.140 --> 00:14:53.600
almost every night. It had a trendy clubs, the dues,

269
00:14:53.601 --> 00:14:56.480
as many people as he good and funnel them back to his apartment.

270
00:14:56.540 --> 00:14:58.340
When he woke up at 4:00 PM, the next day,

271
00:14:58.490 --> 00:15:02.060
there might be hoards of gorgeous young men who needed to be chased away before

272
00:15:02.061 --> 00:15:06.080
the madness could begin a fresh. It was a crazy time even by rockstar levels.

273
00:15:06.470 --> 00:15:08.660
And it also seemed to be freeing. Finally,

274
00:15:08.690 --> 00:15:12.260
mercury was becoming the icon has perhaps always dreamed of being the

275
00:15:12.860 --> 00:15:14.120
uninhibited by sexual music.

276
00:15:14.150 --> 00:15:19.010
God has young self could hardly DataMagine sadly this freedom wouldn't last.

277
00:15:19.250 --> 00:15:20.600
And at least September of 1982,

278
00:15:20.840 --> 00:15:24.410
Freddie mercury turns up at a New York doctor's office complaining of a weird

279
00:15:24.411 --> 00:15:26.150
white spot on his tongue. Today.

280
00:15:26.151 --> 00:15:30.260
We know it was likely an early sign of the HIV infection probably picked up that

281
00:15:30.710 --> 00:15:30.830
summer.

282
00:15:30.830 --> 00:15:34.730
But back then AIDS was only just starting to seep into the public consciousness.

283
00:15:34.850 --> 00:15:38.840
In fact, the name AIDS was still a couple of weeks away from being coined,

284
00:15:38.930 --> 00:15:41.150
but while their men's no sudden outing in the press,

285
00:15:41.151 --> 00:15:44.510
no stigma attached to Mercury's name. It also meant something else,

286
00:15:45.140 --> 00:15:46.790
no cure for the rest of his life.

287
00:15:46.820 --> 00:15:50.090
Freddie Mercury's body would be slowly eaten away by the disease.

288
00:15:50.450 --> 00:15:51.950
It hadn't even known existed.

289
00:15:52.310 --> 00:15:56.450
That disease he wouldn't even be officially diagnosed with until 1987

290
00:15:56.720 --> 00:15:59.180
tragically. His days were already numbered.

291
00:16:05.740 --> 00:16:06.573
<v 3>If you were to.</v>

292
00:16:06.640 --> 00:16:08.230
<v 0>Queens fortunes across the 1980s,</v>

293
00:16:08.231 --> 00:16:12.340
they would resemble one of those jagged sham prize graphs with the arrow

294
00:16:12.350 --> 00:16:15.520
shooting wildly up and down on the one hand,

295
00:16:15.580 --> 00:16:18.220
the band scored its biggest single yet with on depression,

296
00:16:18.250 --> 00:16:21.700
sometimes known to delusional wide rappers as ice, ice, baby.

297
00:16:21.730 --> 00:16:25.360
They also cracked South America playing what was then Brazil's biggest of a rock

298
00:16:25.361 --> 00:16:25.960
concert.

299
00:16:25.960 --> 00:16:29.530
On the other hand is that U S sales took a battering as Freddy's Quinn as became

300
00:16:29.531 --> 00:16:31.720
more overt before falling through the floor.

301
00:16:31.721 --> 00:16:34.780
When the band appeared in drag for that video, I want to break free.

302
00:16:34.870 --> 00:16:35.561
At the same time,

303
00:16:35.561 --> 00:16:38.320
tensions backstage were resulting in fist fights between members,

304
00:16:38.321 --> 00:16:41.740
including one at an Italian festival that turned into a full on brawl.

305
00:16:41.800 --> 00:16:43.900
But perhaps than the deer came in 1984,

306
00:16:43.901 --> 00:16:47.620
when queen played South Africa at the time Nelson Mandela was still in prison in

307
00:16:47.621 --> 00:16:51.370
the world was boycotting the apartheid regime into this queen steps.

308
00:16:51.370 --> 00:16:54.640
Do you play eight nights at a whites only entertainment complex?

309
00:16:54.850 --> 00:16:58.270
The resulting Fure nearly killed their reputation queen were handed a massive

310
00:16:58.271 --> 00:17:01.810
fine by the musicians union and were professionally ostracized. Yes,

311
00:17:01.811 --> 00:17:05.770
this stupid self-inflicted low would be followed by the bands and Freddy's

312
00:17:06.010 --> 00:17:09.280
greatest high. In 1995, the band received a call from Bob.

313
00:17:09.310 --> 00:17:13.060
Geldof asking them to play a 20 minutes set for live aid concert,

314
00:17:13.061 --> 00:17:14.140
designed to raise money.

315
00:17:14.230 --> 00:17:18.520
If a famine relief in Ethiopia broadcast to 110 countries with global viewer

316
00:17:18.521 --> 00:17:22.810
numbers reaching 1.9 billion live aid was simply the biggest concert in history.

317
00:17:22.990 --> 00:17:26.590
Everyone from the beach boys distinct to David Bowie was playing. Yes,

318
00:17:26.680 --> 00:17:29.550
it would be queen that stole the show. Unlike some of the other artists,

319
00:17:29.830 --> 00:17:32.860
Freddy knew this was performance on a grandiose scale.

320
00:17:33.130 --> 00:17:35.830
That 20 minutes would be the hits and nothing more.

321
00:17:35.950 --> 00:17:37.960
And Freddy was going to give it as a today.

322
00:17:38.380 --> 00:17:41.290
Queens live aid set is a metric with a showmanship.

323
00:17:41.320 --> 00:17:45.130
Probably never seemed since Nike re electrifying the crowd, his energy,

324
00:17:45.340 --> 00:17:49.560
his passion was practically stupid human it's estimated that at one it's not

325
00:17:49.561 --> 00:17:54.090
just 40% of the global population tuned in to rock along with them as career

326
00:17:54.120 --> 00:17:58.010
peaks go. This was a variable Everest that same year.

327
00:17:58.260 --> 00:18:00.720
Freddy also had a new high in his personal life in March.

328
00:18:00.721 --> 00:18:04.320
He met Irish hairdresser at Jim Houghton have a gay club in London.

329
00:18:04.590 --> 00:18:06.720
Originally Huston was just another conquest,

330
00:18:06.750 --> 00:18:09.270
but after a few weeks of fooling around, how did untold Freddy?

331
00:18:09.540 --> 00:18:13.440
It would have to choose between keeping him or keeping up his Lethario ways.

332
00:18:13.530 --> 00:18:17.190
Incredibly Freddie chose Hutton for two would be together until the end of

333
00:18:17.191 --> 00:18:20.370
Freddie's life and short Freddie mercury in 1985 had everything,

334
00:18:20.400 --> 00:18:21.450
the respect of the world,

335
00:18:21.630 --> 00:18:25.350
a steady non-volatile relationship and more money than he could ever

336
00:18:25.351 --> 00:18:26.550
realistically spend.

337
00:18:26.820 --> 00:18:30.150
But this was sadly just a temporary high that very next year,

338
00:18:30.151 --> 00:18:34.140
the arrow would come plunging right back down to earth. By 1986,

339
00:18:34.141 --> 00:18:36.300
it was clear that Freddie was seriously ill.

340
00:18:36.420 --> 00:18:38.760
His parents became gone like a starving man.

341
00:18:39.120 --> 00:18:41.910
Rumors began to swirl in the British press that he might've age.

342
00:18:41.970 --> 00:18:44.190
The following year, two of his friends died from the virus.

343
00:18:44.310 --> 00:18:48.120
Not long after a former manager turns boyfriends out of the singer to a British

344
00:18:48.150 --> 00:18:51.420
tabloid already feeling hurt and betrayed. Freddy. Last bit,

345
00:18:51.421 --> 00:18:53.370
the bullet around Easter, 1987,

346
00:18:53.670 --> 00:18:57.360
he went for an HIV test and you already know what the results were.

347
00:18:57.480 --> 00:19:01.860
At first mercury told only Jim Hutton retreated to his Kensington home and rally

348
00:19:01.861 --> 00:19:03.600
ventured out in 1987,

349
00:19:03.750 --> 00:19:06.780
there was only one possible outcome to a positive HIV test.

350
00:19:07.290 --> 00:19:10.860
Death aged barely 40. Freddie was already living out his final year.

351
00:19:11.330 --> 00:19:12.163
<v 1>Yes.</v>

352
00:19:18.230 --> 00:19:22.310
<v 0>Harry's final years were almost unbearably sad from a hedonistic rock. God.</v>

353
00:19:22.311 --> 00:19:26.150
He became a recluse only, ever venturing out to work in the recording studio.

354
00:19:26.360 --> 00:19:28.220
Still, at least he wasn't alone.

355
00:19:28.400 --> 00:19:33.080
Jim Hutton remained by his side becoming almost as much as carer as his lover.

356
00:19:34.040 --> 00:19:34.940
Mary Austin too, was still around.

357
00:19:34.970 --> 00:19:38.030
She spent as much time with Freddie as possible in those final years,

358
00:19:38.031 --> 00:19:41.540
still the only person the singer felt he could really relate to. Yes,

359
00:19:41.541 --> 00:19:44.480
even as he was dying, Freddie still retained his acid tongue.

360
00:19:45.020 --> 00:19:47.270
If he thought Queen's music would last, he Reilly responded.

361
00:19:47.630 --> 00:19:50.630
I didn't give it dare. I wouldn't be around to worry about it.

362
00:19:50.930 --> 00:19:54.500
The end came in November, 1991 on the 23rd of that month.

363
00:19:54.530 --> 00:19:58.970
Mercury at last released a statement confirming to the world that he had AIDS.

364
00:19:59.330 --> 00:20:02.420
Well, maybe it's unfair to say Freddy released. According to Jim Hutton,

365
00:20:02.421 --> 00:20:06.140
mercury spent his last days on earth dose stop to his eyeballs on morphine

366
00:20:06.380 --> 00:20:08.060
drifting in and out of consciousness.

367
00:20:08.270 --> 00:20:11.930
It had been a deliberate decision to keep his diagnosis a secret until it no

368
00:20:11.931 --> 00:20:13.010
longer made a difference.

369
00:20:13.070 --> 00:20:17.600
Freddie mercury died the next day of bronchial pneumonia aged only 45

370
00:20:18.200 --> 00:20:21.860
Hutton still playing the role of carer was changing the stars close as he passed

371
00:20:21.861 --> 00:20:25.520
away. And he later said, while I was putting his boxes on, I knew had gone.

372
00:20:25.790 --> 00:20:28.130
I went into my bedroom and stopped a carriage clock.

373
00:20:28.400 --> 00:20:31.190
Freddie had given to me the time it was 12 minutes to seven.

374
00:20:31.580 --> 00:20:32.390
When the news broke,

375
00:20:32.390 --> 00:20:35.330
hundreds of fans turned up outside the home to pay their respects.

376
00:20:35.360 --> 00:20:38.450
There was talk of a grand funeral final party.

377
00:20:38.451 --> 00:20:40.280
It isn't that Curry off into the heavens,

378
00:20:40.400 --> 00:20:44.210
but Freddie mercury had already died perhaps months earlier. In those last days,

379
00:20:44.240 --> 00:20:48.490
fruit Besara had been all that remains and he wants to do a small traditional

380
00:20:48.910 --> 00:20:53.410
sorrow stream. Funeral Reddy's body was cremated on November the 27th, 1991,

381
00:20:53.650 --> 00:20:55.060
along with the bulk of his estate.

382
00:20:55.060 --> 00:20:59.230
He left his ashes to Mary Austin who agreed to scatter them some West secret the

383
00:20:59.231 --> 00:21:02.770
location she chose remains unknown to this day in the wake of Freddy's death.

384
00:21:02.800 --> 00:21:05.830
Bahamian Rhapsody was rereleased in Britain where it shot to the top of the

385
00:21:05.831 --> 00:21:09.820
charts or royalties went to the Terrence Higgins trust UK charity,

386
00:21:09.850 --> 00:21:11.410
combating HIV and AIDS.

387
00:21:11.560 --> 00:21:14.800
Yet this wasn't the end of Mercury's time in the charts before he died,

388
00:21:14.801 --> 00:21:17.770
the singer had horridly recorded vocals. So several new songs,

389
00:21:17.771 --> 00:21:22.120
which the other members of queen then set to music and release as a last hurrah

390
00:21:22.300 --> 00:21:23.860
for a brief period in the 1990s,

391
00:21:23.861 --> 00:21:28.570
it almost felt like Freddy or at least his ghost was back and just talented and

392
00:21:28.571 --> 00:21:31.810
outrageous as ever today, nearly 30 years after his passing,

393
00:21:31.811 --> 00:21:34.270
the legacy of Freddie mercury still lives on.

394
00:21:34.510 --> 00:21:38.050
Even those you consider queen the epitome of style over substance acknowledge.

395
00:21:38.050 --> 00:21:41.830
He was one of a kinds performer with an unbelievable vocal range.

396
00:21:41.920 --> 00:21:45.580
He also remains legendary for his personal life since 1999,

397
00:21:45.581 --> 00:21:49.420
by visibility day has been celebrated every September a month. Chosen,

398
00:21:49.421 --> 00:21:52.120
purely being one Freddie mercury was born in. Yeah,

399
00:21:52.150 --> 00:21:53.860
for all his influence in other areas,

400
00:21:53.920 --> 00:21:57.250
it will always be his music that Freddy is best remembered for.

401
00:21:57.460 --> 00:21:59.830
Here was a man of almost unbelievable talents.

402
00:21:59.831 --> 00:22:04.210
A man with a voice that could sell quiet tragedy as easily as it could sell

403
00:22:04.270 --> 00:22:07.450
operatic bombast in the ends, it was a talent.

404
00:22:07.690 --> 00:22:12.280
This allowed him to live up to his own mission statement to become a star global

405
00:22:12.281 --> 00:22:15.220
icon. There will likely never be another Freddie mercury,

406
00:22:15.370 --> 00:22:19.750
but the music he left us is already enough to ensure his name lives on for

407
00:22:19.751 --> 00:22:22.810
centuries. So I really hope you found that video. Interesting. If you did,
