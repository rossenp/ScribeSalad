00:00:02.461 --> 00:00:06.330
Sometimes it's easy to get the whole team together in the same room all the

3
00:00:06.331 --> 00:00:08.820
times you need remote HQ more than the internet.

4
00:00:14.810 --> 00:00:17.600
It sounds like you said the history turns on the smallest is moments.

5
00:00:17.690 --> 00:00:18.441
If that's the case,

6
00:00:18.441 --> 00:00:21.890
then it's hard to imagine a moment smaller than the one that took place in

7
00:00:21.891 --> 00:00:24.080
October the 31st, 15, 17,

8
00:00:24.200 --> 00:00:29.030
that date an obscure angry monk took a list of 95 things he was off about

9
00:00:29.360 --> 00:00:33.830
and nailed it to the door of Wittenberg church. As gestures go, it was dramatic,

10
00:00:33.831 --> 00:00:35.870
but pointless. So provincial stunt,

11
00:00:36.080 --> 00:00:39.440
and one of the unfashionable corners of the Holy Roman empire,

12
00:00:39.590 --> 00:00:42.830
yet it was from these humble beginnings that a series of events emerged that

13
00:00:42.831 --> 00:00:45.710
would shake both Europe and Christianity to that.

14
00:00:45.711 --> 00:00:49.460
Cause that off a monk who was none other than Martin Luther ruins.

15
00:00:49.640 --> 00:00:52.400
His actions were about to spark the reformation,

16
00:00:52.700 --> 00:00:55.400
the eldest child of a launch family with peasant origins,

17
00:00:55.401 --> 00:01:00.320
Martin Luther was living proof of that old adage about some men being born to

18
00:01:00.321 --> 00:01:04.880
greatness while others have greatness thrust upon them all through his early

19
00:01:04.881 --> 00:01:08.930
life. He showed no signs of being anything other than stubbornly ungreat.

20
00:01:09.050 --> 00:01:13.160
But when the time game he would be the one who ushered in a brand new era in

21
00:01:13.161 --> 00:01:14.180
religious history,

22
00:01:21.110 --> 00:01:24.410
It was a storm that did it all the centuries of religious drive,

23
00:01:24.411 --> 00:01:26.450
all the dead of the 30 years war.

24
00:01:26.660 --> 00:01:30.830
None of it could have happened without one area of low pressure forming above

25
00:01:30.831 --> 00:01:35.570
Germany and the summer of 1505 that's because that fateful July day,

26
00:01:35.571 --> 00:01:38.720
a law student in Martin Luther just happened to be walking home.

27
00:01:39.020 --> 00:01:41.960
When the storm broke right about him by all accounts,

28
00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:45.950
there was one of those storms that only appears in fiction full of lashing rain

29
00:01:45.951 --> 00:01:50.210
and apocalyptic lightning, terrifying Luther offered up. They shouted prep.

30
00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:51.260
If the storm ceased,

31
00:01:51.261 --> 00:01:54.740
he would quit his studies and devote himself to God almost immediately.

32
00:01:54.741 --> 00:01:58.820
The wind debated just days later, Luther followed through on his vow.

33
00:01:58.910 --> 00:02:02.720
From that moment on the course of Western Christianity was set.

34
00:02:02.930 --> 00:02:04.970
The reformation was on its way.

35
00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:08.990
The man who had Russia written was born on November the 10th, 1483,

36
00:02:08.991 --> 00:02:11.660
the eldest of nine siblings, although Martin Luther,

37
00:02:11.661 --> 00:02:13.610
his parents were of peasant stock.

38
00:02:13.610 --> 00:02:16.670
Something you used to humble brag about they'd come far from their lowly

39
00:02:16.671 --> 00:02:17.330
origins.

40
00:02:17.330 --> 00:02:21.650
Luther's father Hans had gotten into or refining and managed to build a decent

41
00:02:21.651 --> 00:02:25.580
business. When Lisa was young, Hans was even made town counselor,

42
00:02:25.610 --> 00:02:27.080
not quite ascending to the Elise,

43
00:02:27.081 --> 00:02:30.650
maybe about light years beyond what German peasants could normally dream of.

44
00:02:30.680 --> 00:02:31.940
Thanks do breaks like this.

45
00:02:31.941 --> 00:02:35.720
Martin Luther was able to get an education learning Latin and getting tutored by

46
00:02:35.960 --> 00:02:38.330
an ecclesiastical brotherhood. He did so well.

47
00:02:38.480 --> 00:02:41.480
There's in 1501 homes enrolled in an effort, a university.

48
00:02:41.481 --> 00:02:45.530
Then the top place for brainy dudes to study the plan was for Luther to study

49
00:02:45.531 --> 00:02:45.890
law,

50
00:02:45.890 --> 00:02:50.540
get an awesome job and then drag the family ever further into what then passed

51
00:02:50.541 --> 00:02:54.230
for the middle classes by 1505, Luther had his master's degree.

52
00:02:54.320 --> 00:02:57.860
You had purchased all his materials for the upcoming law course and generally

53
00:02:57.861 --> 00:02:58.820
settled on Zooey.

54
00:02:59.680 --> 00:03:03.370
LifeTrack that guaranteed in both happy parents and us or obscurity.

55
00:03:03.430 --> 00:03:08.200
But then the boy happens to go walking outside in July of 1505 and everything

56
00:03:08.201 --> 00:03:11.200
changed. You already know the story from the cold open,

57
00:03:11.201 --> 00:03:14.170
the lashing rain as you sized lightening bolts, the shouted prayer,

58
00:03:14.171 --> 00:03:19.060
the vow to become a monk just days later via one blazing rout with hands Martin

59
00:03:19.061 --> 00:03:23.290
Luther answered to the monastery of the order of the hermits of St. Augustine.

60
00:03:23.470 --> 00:03:26.500
The Augustinians at this time were split into two factions.

61
00:03:26.501 --> 00:03:30.460
One which believed everything should be as strict and as joyless as possible.

62
00:03:30.750 --> 00:03:34.540
And to one which favored everything being just a less crappy.

63
00:03:34.930 --> 00:03:39.370
This was possibly join us Hoff. The so-called observance faction,

64
00:03:39.371 --> 00:03:43.600
which meant cold rims rising at the crack of Dawn fasting, confessing,

65
00:03:43.601 --> 00:03:46.150
and other incredibly not fun things.

66
00:03:46.151 --> 00:03:49.900
But Lisa took it like an unbaptized doctor, Holy water.

67
00:03:50.080 --> 00:03:51.580
He followed the rules spends this time,

68
00:03:51.581 --> 00:03:56.500
studying theology became almost the platonic ideal of a monk. In fact,

69
00:03:56.560 --> 00:03:57.640
at this stage in his life,

70
00:03:57.670 --> 00:04:01.650
he showed no signs of rebellion or individual thinking at all by 1508.

71
00:04:01.660 --> 00:04:05.530
He was teaching theology at the university of Wittenberg and doing a decent

72
00:04:05.620 --> 00:04:08.110
average job. It would take the crisis of 15,

73
00:04:08.111 --> 00:04:11.590
10 to finally shake him out of his rut that year, Pope Julius.

74
00:04:11.591 --> 00:04:15.310
The second announced that he was going to force the observance and non observant

75
00:04:15.311 --> 00:04:19.420
Augustinians to merge into a single order for Luther's observed and faction.

76
00:04:19.450 --> 00:04:21.760
This was a little like being part of an upright fraternity.

77
00:04:21.850 --> 00:04:26.500
You suddenly told it has to merge with animal house. There was outrage panic,

78
00:04:26.620 --> 00:04:29.830
and Luther's monastery the monks scrambled to find someone to go to Rome and

79
00:04:29.831 --> 00:04:33.730
make their case before the Pope and what you can to guess who they chose in late

80
00:04:33.731 --> 00:04:37.780
15, 10 Martin Luther sat out from Germany for the first time in his life heading

81
00:04:37.781 --> 00:04:38.680
South for Italy,

82
00:04:38.830 --> 00:04:42.370
for the eternal city and the beating heart of Western Christianity.

83
00:04:44.890 --> 00:04:49.750
What he saw when he got that would transform him from a pious average monk into

84
00:04:49.751 --> 00:04:51.490
the most dangerous heritage.

85
00:04:58.230 --> 00:04:58.500
<v 1>Um.</v>

86
00:04:58.500 --> 00:05:02.580
<v 0>You ever spent years dreaming of visiting somewhere only for it to turn out,</v>

87
00:05:02.581 --> 00:05:05.130
to be just a bit crap in real life.

88
00:05:05.190 --> 00:05:09.000
While that intense feeling of disappointment was probably only a fraction of

89
00:05:09.001 --> 00:05:12.630
what Martin Luther experienced in Rome arriving at the end of the year,

90
00:05:12.631 --> 00:05:16.350
the monk discovered not a shining Kristy and Citadel button,

91
00:05:16.351 --> 00:05:20.580
moral toilets in Rome. Luther spent time with priests who were openly corrupts,

92
00:05:20.610 --> 00:05:21.990
laughing at their followers.

93
00:05:21.991 --> 00:05:24.540
As they charged extortionate amounts were saying mass.

94
00:05:24.570 --> 00:05:26.220
He was so disillusioned that if humans,

95
00:05:26.610 --> 00:05:30.840
Rome is a harlot and that was before the Pope ignored is pleased to keep the

96
00:05:30.841 --> 00:05:34.440
Augustinian order separate. By the time Luther sloped back to Germany,

97
00:05:34.470 --> 00:05:37.860
he was exhausted depressed, and his faith was deeply shaken,

98
00:05:38.010 --> 00:05:41.460
but it would take several more years before this spiritual torment became

99
00:05:41.461 --> 00:05:42.960
outward action. In the meantime,

100
00:05:42.961 --> 00:05:45.300
Luther settled into a life of teaching in Wittenberg,

101
00:05:45.330 --> 00:05:48.300
then an up-and-coming students down with a new university,

102
00:05:48.330 --> 00:05:50.670
but what's in bag at something else going for it too.

103
00:05:50.880 --> 00:05:53.700
It was a key part of the empass future. At the time,

104
00:05:53.760 --> 00:05:56.580
our story is set Germany as a nation didn't exist.

105
00:05:56.790 --> 00:06:01.670
Instead Europe was straddled by a bam author known as the Holy Roman

106
00:06:01.671 --> 00:06:03.590
empire, a collection of hundreds of States,

107
00:06:03.591 --> 00:06:06.920
principalities Dutchies free cities and random valleys,

108
00:06:06.921 --> 00:06:08.480
somehow wielding political power.

109
00:06:08.481 --> 00:06:12.740
The empire under the Catholic Habsburg rulers considered itself the defender of

110
00:06:12.741 --> 00:06:16.790
European Christianity while the Habsburgs held the post of Holy Roman emperor,

111
00:06:17.030 --> 00:06:18.080
it wasn't hereditary.

112
00:06:18.140 --> 00:06:21.590
Each new emperor had to be chosen by an Imperial council of seven.

113
00:06:21.620 --> 00:06:23.150
This means those on the council,

114
00:06:23.151 --> 00:06:27.680
wielded out signs influenced one of those seven was the Alexa of Saxony

115
00:06:27.890 --> 00:06:30.740
Frederick the wise, although it was Catholic Frederick,

116
00:06:30.770 --> 00:06:35.120
the wise was also a humanist and a relatively free thinker who believes in

117
00:06:35.150 --> 00:06:39.890
outrageous stuff like fair trawls. He was also the guy in charge of belief,

118
00:06:40.040 --> 00:06:41.390
this new home town of Wittenberg,

119
00:06:41.570 --> 00:06:45.140
the elector most openly trying to gain more autonomy from the emperor.

120
00:06:45.230 --> 00:06:49.010
It would be these Chan's qualities that would soon turn Frederick the wise and

121
00:06:49.011 --> 00:06:52.570
to Martin Luther's staunchest protected. But before we get that,

122
00:06:52.571 --> 00:06:57.250
we have to pick out one more thread from this weave that's known as pre

123
00:06:57.370 --> 00:07:01.480
reformation Europe. It's one more thread to add to our threads on Frederick,

124
00:07:01.481 --> 00:07:05.500
the wise, the election system of the Holy Roman empire and Martin Luther's

125
00:07:05.501 --> 00:07:06.370
disillusionment.

126
00:07:06.460 --> 00:07:10.300
It's one more thread that will explain how this John's upheaval managed to

127
00:07:10.301 --> 00:07:15.280
happen. The threads marked indulgences in 1513, Pope Julius,

128
00:07:15.281 --> 00:07:19.660
the second went to meet his maker and was replaced by Leo the 10th. Now Leo,

129
00:07:19.661 --> 00:07:23.530
his whole thing was grandiose projects to fund his grandis the reconstruction of

130
00:07:23.531 --> 00:07:27.820
the Basilica of St. Peter. He issued a new set of indulgences, gets out of jail,

131
00:07:27.821 --> 00:07:28.810
free cards for sin.

132
00:07:28.930 --> 00:07:32.500
Indulgences could be bought the cash and resigned for which the Pope would

133
00:07:32.501 --> 00:07:34.450
absolve you of your mortal sins. Now,

134
00:07:34.480 --> 00:07:38.680
technically you were supposed to both by the indulgence and do some good deeds,

135
00:07:38.710 --> 00:07:39.730
but by 15, 15,

136
00:07:39.731 --> 00:07:43.780
the system had dissolved into rich folks sending away and then paying the church

137
00:07:43.810 --> 00:07:44.590
to ignore it.

138
00:07:44.590 --> 00:07:48.130
Because of this indulgence is pretty controversial among poor people who

139
00:07:48.131 --> 00:07:51.670
couldn't afford to cover as the neighbors all so whatever,

140
00:07:51.700 --> 00:07:54.850
but they were also frowned upon by the aristocracy.

141
00:07:54.910 --> 00:07:57.070
Many German princes felt indulgences,

142
00:07:57.190 --> 00:08:00.430
but just a way for the Pope to shake them down every time he wanted a new

143
00:08:00.431 --> 00:08:04.090
Basilica. So when the fry Johan tenants all started touring,

144
00:08:04.091 --> 00:08:07.990
what is now the East of Germany, shilling Leo, the 10th new cheat cards.

145
00:08:08.200 --> 00:08:11.650
People were primed to react. And here we are,

146
00:08:11.651 --> 00:08:16.630
then I'd lost the moment when all these threads we've been gently talking at are

147
00:08:16.631 --> 00:08:19.630
going to be yanked together. When that happens,

148
00:08:19.750 --> 00:08:23.960
the entire we've known as Europe is going to suddenly unravel. And just,

149
00:08:24.010 --> 00:08:26.740
you can bet that there's going to be lots of bloodshed.

150
00:08:26.920 --> 00:08:29.500
Now we're stepping away from Martin Luther for a quick minute,

151
00:08:29.501 --> 00:08:32.560
to talk about a brand new sponsor, promote HQ,

152
00:08:32.680 --> 00:08:34.000
no matter what line of work you're in.

153
00:08:34.150 --> 00:08:37.060
There's a pretty good chance that you've had to have at least one meeting online

154
00:08:37.300 --> 00:08:41.380
here in 2020. Lots of people are working exclusively for all the home right now.

155
00:08:41.410 --> 00:08:42.370
And depending on your job,

156
00:08:42.400 --> 00:08:45.790
that trends might continue into the future for quite some time.

157
00:08:45.791 --> 00:08:46.960
For many working professionals,

158
00:08:46.990 --> 00:08:50.470
it's more important than ever to have a functional online meeting space.

159
00:08:50.560 --> 00:08:52.870
And I don't know if I'd call myself a professional.

160
00:08:53.050 --> 00:08:56.250
Having an online meeting space for me has been super important.

161
00:08:56.350 --> 00:08:59.460
That's why remote HQ is so great. This isn't just another virtual space.

162
00:08:59.461 --> 00:09:02.880
Hold a video call. This is a full blown online workspace.

163
00:09:02.881 --> 00:09:06.390
There's tons of tools at your disposal to improve your team's functionality.

164
00:09:06.480 --> 00:09:08.970
So what makes remote HQ your best option? Well,

165
00:09:09.000 --> 00:09:13.050
it's got a totally customizable workspace that can be fitted with apps that best

166
00:09:13.470 --> 00:09:18.120
serve your jobs purposes. Got a screen that is multi-lateral collaborative,

167
00:09:18.121 --> 00:09:21.810
where anyone can just jump in, make notes or change the screen themselves,

168
00:09:21.811 --> 00:09:22.950
depending on that permissions.

169
00:09:23.130 --> 00:09:26.040
It's also got software that records all your sessions and lets you search

170
00:09:26.150 --> 00:09:30.090
through your session notes later on, which makes backtracking even easier.

171
00:09:30.330 --> 00:09:33.420
And speaking of that software, remote HQ is browser based,

172
00:09:33.421 --> 00:09:37.020
which means there's no scary, questionable downloads going onto your computer.

173
00:09:37.380 --> 00:09:40.950
No one likes Nass meeting rooms are also locked for authenticated users only,

174
00:09:40.951 --> 00:09:43.620
which means that you don't have to worry about random teenagers,

175
00:09:43.621 --> 00:09:46.170
just guessing your password and saying hello.

176
00:09:46.260 --> 00:09:51.030
So all of this sounds like the missing tool that your newly remote or originally

177
00:09:51.031 --> 00:09:55.320
remote team needs this year or remote HQ is going to be the solution that you

178
00:09:55.321 --> 00:09:56.850
didn't even realize you need it right now,

179
00:09:56.851 --> 00:10:01.470
you can use a remote hq.com forward slash biographics to start a free trial.

180
00:10:01.500 --> 00:10:05.970
And when you're ready to launch use code biographics for three months free and

181
00:10:05.971 --> 00:10:07.110
let's get back to today's video.

182
00:10:13.880 --> 00:10:17.980
Here's the frog tassel was making the rounds was welcomed by absolutely nobody.

183
00:10:19.850 --> 00:10:20.683
<v 2>Frederick DWIs.</v>

184
00:10:20.810 --> 00:10:21.890
<v 0>Banned him from Zack's nail though.</v>

185
00:10:21.891 --> 00:10:25.250
He couldn't stop him from operating just over the border. In spring of 15,

186
00:10:25.251 --> 00:10:29.990
17 Tetzel set up shop in Jew to bog less than 40 kilometers from Wittenberg.

187
00:10:30.080 --> 00:10:33.950
Now 40 kilometers in the early 16th century seems like a lot further than it

188
00:10:33.951 --> 00:10:36.890
does in modern Germany of cars and auto Barnes.

189
00:10:36.891 --> 00:10:40.580
But it still wasn't enough for Martin Luther that seeing tassels shameless

190
00:10:40.581 --> 00:10:44.090
flogging of indulgences is just another part of the corruption had witnessed in

191
00:10:44.091 --> 00:10:47.600
Rome. Luther finally snaps. He wrote out a long objection,

192
00:10:48.080 --> 00:10:51.110
titled disputation on the power of indulgences.

193
00:10:51.170 --> 00:10:53.840
It contains 95 objections or theses.

194
00:10:53.870 --> 00:10:56.600
All of which boil down to a handful of points.

195
00:10:56.660 --> 00:10:59.510
One repentance is only possible through God himself,

196
00:10:59.540 --> 00:11:03.590
not through the buying of indulgences to therefore the only human path to

197
00:11:03.591 --> 00:11:06.950
salvation is faith, not worldly deeds three.

198
00:11:06.980 --> 00:11:11.270
So selling indulgences is just a swindle to build the Pope's new Basilica or

199
00:11:11.271 --> 00:11:12.170
Azusa put it.

200
00:11:12.320 --> 00:11:16.160
Why does not the Pope whose wealth today is greater than the wealth of the

201
00:11:16.161 --> 00:11:20.450
richest. Crassus to the Basilica of St. Peter with his own money,

202
00:11:20.570 --> 00:11:25.220
rather than with the money of poor believers. Yet, despite this criticism,

203
00:11:25.221 --> 00:11:28.190
the overall tone of the 95 theses was pretty malt.

204
00:11:28.220 --> 00:11:31.370
There's nothing in them to suggest that Luther knew he was writing the most

205
00:11:31.371 --> 00:11:35.600
explosive documents of the last 600 years, but there's also no doubt.

206
00:11:35.601 --> 00:11:38.690
Luther wanted his words to find an audience. Once he finished writing,

207
00:11:38.691 --> 00:11:41.750
he sat on his work until October the 31st 1517,

208
00:11:41.751 --> 00:11:43.910
the day before all saints day a day.

209
00:11:43.911 --> 00:11:47.810
When thousands of pilgrims poured into Wittenberg then went down, was busy.

210
00:11:47.811 --> 00:11:51.110
He marched down, took his theses to the church and enabled them to the door.

211
00:11:51.230 --> 00:11:53.710
At least that's the popular version. In reality,

212
00:11:53.711 --> 00:11:56.950
most scholars agree that Luther probably didn't nail his thesis. Do anything.

213
00:11:57.070 --> 00:12:00.430
What he did do though, was sent copies, do a bunch of people, including fraught,

214
00:12:00.910 --> 00:12:03.070
tassels, boss college, and all Albert Brandenburg.

215
00:12:03.100 --> 00:12:06.460
It was these mailings that would turn a minor theological dispute into one of

216
00:12:06.461 --> 00:12:09.520
the biggest events in European history. When Albert received his copy,

217
00:12:09.550 --> 00:12:13.510
he was livid, not with tat sulfur. So shamelessly Hawking indulgences,

218
00:12:13.780 --> 00:12:16.720
but with Luther, he forwarded this copy to Rome, demanding the Pope,

219
00:12:16.721 --> 00:12:19.210
investigate this heritage monk at the same time,

220
00:12:19.211 --> 00:12:23.080
other copies of Luther's 95 theses web, starting to spread across Germany.

221
00:12:23.260 --> 00:12:26.680
Thanks to the relatively recent technology of the printing press new copies

222
00:12:26.681 --> 00:12:31.060
could be distributed across a vast area in weeks rather than months or years

223
00:12:31.090 --> 00:12:34.930
before 1517 was over Luther's work was appearing in Leipzig, Nuremberg,

224
00:12:34.931 --> 00:12:37.960
and even Basel down in Switzerland. However, the Luther wasn't,

225
00:12:37.961 --> 00:12:38.860
the ones spreading it.

226
00:12:38.920 --> 00:12:42.820
The theses seemed to have touched a nerve one that compels people to make their

227
00:12:42.821 --> 00:12:44.260
own copies for the elites.

228
00:12:44.620 --> 00:12:48.130
Luthers to rate against indulgences was a useful justification for not sending

229
00:12:48.131 --> 00:12:52.030
any more money to Rome, but the less wealthy it was the anti Italian sentiments.

230
00:12:52.031 --> 00:12:53.950
They responded to the feeling that decent,

231
00:12:54.460 --> 00:12:58.690
hardworking Germans were being fleeced by a distant and greedy Pope before long,

232
00:12:58.691 --> 00:13:01.120
the theses were even being translated into German.

233
00:13:01.540 --> 00:13:05.380
When Lisa found out he immediately sat about publishing his own translations by

234
00:13:05.381 --> 00:13:09.190
the summer of 1518, the theses were everywhere at this stage,

235
00:13:09.220 --> 00:13:11.650
the reformation wasn't yet reforming anything.

236
00:13:11.680 --> 00:13:15.310
It was just a theological arguments with some political grievances attached,

237
00:13:15.430 --> 00:13:19.330
this sort of thing that were Luther to play it badly or Leo the 10th to play it.

238
00:13:19.331 --> 00:13:21.340
Well, it could have easily dissipated,

239
00:13:21.550 --> 00:13:24.820
but if there's one thing Luther was bound to discover he was good at it.

240
00:13:25.060 --> 00:13:27.550
It was playing the PR game like a.

241
00:13:34.290 --> 00:13:34.500
<v 1>[Inaudible].</v>

242
00:13:34.500 --> 00:13:37.140
<v 0>Well, I saw my 1518 Martin Luther's name was everywhere.</v>

243
00:13:37.200 --> 00:13:41.010
His 95 theses had caught the eye of his ruler. Frederick the wise,

244
00:13:41.160 --> 00:13:44.100
he seems to have realize that he could use this monk as leverage.

245
00:13:44.130 --> 00:13:47.700
So when the Pope demanded Luther present himself in room to be cross-examined,

246
00:13:48.270 --> 00:13:50.910
Frederick has all like, nah, my boy stays here.

247
00:13:51.060 --> 00:13:55.830
We can see this either as Frederick staying true to his humanist principles or

248
00:13:56.340 --> 00:13:58.860
Frederick flexing his political muscles at that moment,

249
00:13:58.980 --> 00:14:01.770
the current Holy Roman emperor was on the brink of death.

250
00:14:01.830 --> 00:14:04.440
Rome had its own candidates. It wants it on the throne,

251
00:14:04.560 --> 00:14:07.830
but that meant not alienating electors like Frederick.

252
00:14:07.950 --> 00:14:12.150
So a compromise was reached with Luther agreeing to be questioned in the German

253
00:14:12.151 --> 00:14:15.510
city of Augsburg. But while this was safer than Rome,

254
00:14:15.511 --> 00:14:20.100
it was still a bit dicey after just three days fled back to

255
00:14:20.101 --> 00:14:21.450
Wittenberg. But before he went,

256
00:14:21.451 --> 00:14:23.790
he left another document attached to the cathedral door,

257
00:14:24.000 --> 00:14:26.730
insisting on his rightness over the next year.

258
00:14:26.730 --> 00:14:30.480
Luther's ideas began to circulate more and more widely in a kind of domino

259
00:14:30.481 --> 00:14:31.110
effect.

260
00:14:31.110 --> 00:14:35.430
The more people who read his word cause the more other dissidents began writing

261
00:14:35.431 --> 00:14:36.600
their own complaints.

262
00:14:36.780 --> 00:14:40.920
Only these new complaints were getting a weightier and weightier challenging the

263
00:14:40.921 --> 00:14:43.020
authority of the Pope himself.

264
00:14:43.200 --> 00:14:46.500
But that's not to say Martin Luther was some kind of theological genius or

265
00:14:46.501 --> 00:14:49.890
anything at the Leipzig debate in June of 50 19. For example,

266
00:14:49.891 --> 00:14:54.440
Luther was by Johan ACC who tricked him into defending some of the

267
00:14:54.560 --> 00:14:56.720
heritage Yon hostess positions.

268
00:14:56.810 --> 00:14:59.780
Given the yawn hosts had been burned at the stake a century earlier.

269
00:14:59.781 --> 00:15:02.480
This was not a great look for Luther,

270
00:15:02.540 --> 00:15:06.980
but now the fight was just as political as it was religious on June the 28th,

271
00:15:06.981 --> 00:15:10.070
15, 19, the electors made 19 year old, Charles the fifth,

272
00:15:10.310 --> 00:15:12.350
Holy Roman emperor to get the gigs,

273
00:15:12.351 --> 00:15:15.710
the non German Charles had to make all sorts of promises to Frederick the wise,

274
00:15:15.711 --> 00:15:20.120
including an end to punishment without trial and to treat Martin Luther fairly.

275
00:15:20.390 --> 00:15:23.630
It may have all been part of a plan to increase Frederick's political clouds,

276
00:15:23.660 --> 00:15:27.140
but it also meant that Lusa was now effectively untouchable,

277
00:15:27.380 --> 00:15:32.120
which may be why I fed up Leo the 10th finally pressed the nuclear button

278
00:15:32.270 --> 00:15:33.620
on the 15th of June 15,

279
00:15:33.621 --> 00:15:38.570
20 Leo issued a papal bull accusing Luther of heresy and giving him 120

280
00:15:38.571 --> 00:15:41.450
days to report to Rome. Such an order was a serious, massive,

281
00:15:41.480 --> 00:15:45.770
but by now Lisa had enough powerful supporters to fight back across the rest of

282
00:15:45.771 --> 00:15:48.890
the year. Luther issued three pamphlets. One of them called the Pope,

283
00:15:48.891 --> 00:15:51.350
the antichrist, while another written in German,

284
00:15:51.650 --> 00:15:56.120
Ames do whip up the mob against Rome declaring we have the empire in name,

285
00:15:56.240 --> 00:15:59.030
but the Pope has all wealth on our bodies,

286
00:15:59.060 --> 00:16:03.380
lives and souls and all that we have, Oh, Nobel princess and gentlemen,

287
00:16:03.500 --> 00:16:08.300
how long will you suffer your lands and your people to be the prey of

288
00:16:08.301 --> 00:16:10.070
these ravening wolves?

289
00:16:10.190 --> 00:16:14.000
It was rhetoric like this that made Lisa a hero to so many Germans,

290
00:16:14.001 --> 00:16:18.260
but his biggest broadside came when the Pope's deadline finally ran out that

291
00:16:18.261 --> 00:16:21.620
December day Luther canceled his classes, took the papal bull into it,

292
00:16:22.130 --> 00:16:23.750
Wittenberg and publicly burned it.

293
00:16:23.870 --> 00:16:27.710
The result was inevitable on January the third, 1521, Leo,

294
00:16:27.711 --> 00:16:31.520
the 10th ex-communicated Martin Liza from the church in normal circumstances.

295
00:16:31.521 --> 00:16:34.160
Excommunication was a death sentence by rights.

296
00:16:34.161 --> 00:16:38.150
Luther should have been arrested by the secular authorities and burned,

297
00:16:38.330 --> 00:16:40.730
but there were two problems.

298
00:16:41.150 --> 00:16:44.780
The first was that Luther was now so infamous that executing him could have

299
00:16:44.840 --> 00:16:48.230
triggered anything from rioting to a civil war.

300
00:16:48.290 --> 00:16:52.370
The second was that Charles the fifth had promised no more punishments without a

301
00:16:52.371 --> 00:16:57.230
fair hearing, something Luther patently had an hat. So once again,

302
00:16:57.231 --> 00:16:58.460
a compromise was reached.

303
00:16:58.520 --> 00:17:02.810
Luther would travel to the German city of worms and face the accusations that

304
00:17:02.870 --> 00:17:03.560
this is all good.

305
00:17:03.560 --> 00:17:07.790
As anyone who have known the meeting in worms would turn into Luther's greatest

306
00:17:07.791 --> 00:17:08.624
triumph.

307
00:17:14.620 --> 00:17:18.880
The showdown between Martin Luther and Charles the fifth came in April of 1521.

308
00:17:18.881 --> 00:17:23.140
And it's known as the diet of worms, which comes as some pretty gross images,

309
00:17:23.260 --> 00:17:27.490
but this was a Dodge in the sense of a formal meeting. And interestingly loser,

310
00:17:27.491 --> 00:17:29.050
wasn't very high on the agenda.

311
00:17:29.260 --> 00:17:33.670
Still that didn't stop the 30 something monk from milking it for all it was

312
00:17:33.671 --> 00:17:35.740
worth. When Martin Luther left Wittenberg,

313
00:17:35.741 --> 00:17:38.530
it wasn't as a lone heritage shuffling off to his fate.

314
00:17:38.740 --> 00:17:42.790
It wasn't even as a confident theologians striding out to do battle.

315
00:17:43.240 --> 00:17:45.520
It was as a frigging celebrities,

316
00:17:47.080 --> 00:17:49.770
Johnny to worms took anything between 10 days to a month,

317
00:17:49.800 --> 00:17:52.470
depending on which source you read all along the way,

318
00:17:52.500 --> 00:17:56.190
Luther was treated like royalty cities through open their Gates towns,

319
00:17:56.191 --> 00:17:58.530
but on welcome displays, it worms itself.

320
00:17:58.710 --> 00:18:03.120
People are said to have scrambled onto rooftops to get a good look at him for

321
00:18:03.121 --> 00:18:06.480
millions of Germans Luther's arguments with the church was now personal,

322
00:18:06.600 --> 00:18:10.050
a David and Goliath tale about one of their own standing up to the might of

323
00:18:10.051 --> 00:18:12.630
Rome. You had even amidst the triumphal procession.

324
00:18:13.170 --> 00:18:15.570
Luther knew the journey might be as lost. Charles.

325
00:18:15.571 --> 00:18:17.490
The fifth promised him safe passage to worms,

326
00:18:17.491 --> 00:18:20.490
but the same thing had been promised to the heritage Yon horse the century

327
00:18:20.491 --> 00:18:23.580
before and ended up with him being burned alive.

328
00:18:23.700 --> 00:18:26.760
The auditor has ended the diet's good. Well, the death is death sentence.

329
00:18:26.790 --> 00:18:30.750
Despite all the drama though, the dad worms got off to a fairly boring start.

330
00:18:30.870 --> 00:18:34.320
Some business had overrun. So when Luther arrived on April the 17th,

331
00:18:34.321 --> 00:18:37.650
he was made to spend nearly the entire day waiting for his case to be heard.

332
00:18:37.890 --> 00:18:41.940
It was only after hours of hanging around that Luther was at last called inside

333
00:18:42.120 --> 00:18:43.200
there before the emperor,

334
00:18:43.201 --> 00:18:47.130
a big pile of his books had been laid out presumably to show what a heretic

335
00:18:47.131 --> 00:18:49.980
wreath was. Not that the two signs went straight into arguing.

336
00:18:50.130 --> 00:18:53.640
Luther was asked if it liked to recant. He asked for a day to think it over.

337
00:18:53.641 --> 00:18:57.000
So everyone adjourns and got back together the next morning overnight,

338
00:18:57.030 --> 00:18:58.710
where did leaked out about what was happening.

339
00:18:58.711 --> 00:19:01.920
And this time the whole was jammed with spectators.

340
00:19:02.010 --> 00:19:06.330
This meant Lisa had a captive audience for what would become his greatest speech

341
00:19:06.420 --> 00:19:07.141
over several hours.

342
00:19:07.141 --> 00:19:11.130
Luther pedantically proved by twisty logic and references to scripture.

343
00:19:11.160 --> 00:19:15.120
Why it was unnecessary for him to recant his killer points was to declare the

344
00:19:15.121 --> 00:19:18.240
Bible, the sole authority and say that it only retract statements.

345
00:19:18.241 --> 00:19:21.120
If they could be proven wrong using scripture. Finally,

346
00:19:21.121 --> 00:19:24.900
he wrapped everything up by declaring here I stand. God, help me.

347
00:19:25.020 --> 00:19:28.200
I can do no other well. Supposedly in reality,

348
00:19:28.350 --> 00:19:31.920
this now famous statement was probably added later by biographers still.

349
00:19:31.980 --> 00:19:34.140
It was a grand performance in response Johns,

350
00:19:34.141 --> 00:19:36.090
the phaser requested a day to think things over.

351
00:19:36.360 --> 00:19:40.980
Is it multiple to imagine how it felt being in Germany for that long night and

352
00:19:40.981 --> 00:19:41.250
nights?

353
00:19:41.250 --> 00:19:45.270
When the future of many of the Holy Roman empire state seems to hang in the

354
00:19:45.271 --> 00:19:49.260
balance of lost on April the 19th, Charles declared had reached his decision.

355
00:19:49.500 --> 00:19:54.060
Luther was a heretic and should be put to death boss in a major twist.

356
00:19:54.090 --> 00:19:58.170
Charles also announced that he was upholding his promise of safe conduct. So,

357
00:19:58.310 --> 00:20:01.380
but as long as Luther remained in worms, while the dye was in session,

358
00:20:01.650 --> 00:20:02.700
he would be unharmed.

359
00:20:02.940 --> 00:20:06.450
It was an active clemency that gave Luther supporters all the time they needed

360
00:20:06.660 --> 00:20:10.980
on April the 26th, 1521 Martin Luther was kidnapped just outside worms.

361
00:20:11.190 --> 00:20:14.850
Almost everyone assumes this had been taken on the Pope's orders and probably

362
00:20:14.851 --> 00:20:15.684
murdered,

363
00:20:15.720 --> 00:20:19.920
but no instead Frederick the wise and arranged for Luther to be spirited away to

364
00:20:19.921 --> 00:20:20.820
a remote castle,

365
00:20:21.030 --> 00:20:24.750
where he was given a false identity and placed into hunting that he remains for

366
00:20:24.780 --> 00:20:28.590
around a year quietly working on a translation of the Bible into German while

367
00:20:28.860 --> 00:20:33.270
the world outside went crazy. By the time new ther surfaced in March of 1522,

368
00:20:33.271 --> 00:20:34.860
the reformation would already be underway.

369
00:20:41.630 --> 00:20:42.171
Key reasons.

370
00:20:42.171 --> 00:20:45.830
The reformation exploded after the diet of worms is that it was never just a

371
00:20:45.831 --> 00:20:50.230
religious issue while who followed Lee. So, uh, and it for the scriptural stuff,

372
00:20:50.260 --> 00:20:53.860
plenty more. We're excited by as anti Italian stances as well.

373
00:20:53.890 --> 00:20:56.920
Plenty more just saw an opportunity to shake things up a bit.

374
00:20:57.040 --> 00:20:58.960
All swaths of German princess, for example,

375
00:20:59.080 --> 00:21:02.380
were encouraged to support lethal purely because doing so demonstrated their

376
00:21:02.381 --> 00:21:04.450
independence from the emperor and shorts.

377
00:21:04.480 --> 00:21:08.680
It was the society-wide shakeups sort of how the explosion of populism in our

378
00:21:08.681 --> 00:21:10.360
own time turned everything on its head,

379
00:21:10.390 --> 00:21:13.090
but times a million or one ends of the spectrum.

380
00:21:13.120 --> 00:21:15.480
You had things like the Augustinian FRAs,

381
00:21:15.850 --> 00:21:19.630
Western bags smashing up their own altarpieces and throwing off the cloth at the

382
00:21:19.631 --> 00:21:20.830
other. You had the peasants war,

383
00:21:20.831 --> 00:21:24.640
which ignited in 1524 and saw farmers rampaging across central Germany,

384
00:21:24.670 --> 00:21:27.550
fighting for increased political rights under the convenient banner of

385
00:21:27.551 --> 00:21:30.070
Lutheranism in between. There were rods,

386
00:21:30.100 --> 00:21:34.210
new religious ordinances and serious reform methods that completely transformed

387
00:21:34.211 --> 00:21:35.044
parts of Europe.

388
00:21:35.260 --> 00:21:39.310
And that's not even mentioning the other reformers who appeared in Luther's wake

389
00:21:39.311 --> 00:21:44.200
like whole drink Swingley down in Zurich or John Calvin in Geneva.

390
00:21:44.380 --> 00:21:48.940
Yes. Even as the reformation get up into a cultural transformation,

391
00:21:49.480 --> 00:21:52.600
Luther's part in, it was already drawing to a close post worms.

392
00:21:52.601 --> 00:21:56.830
His role became ever more peripheral. The change hastened by some bad decisions.

393
00:21:56.920 --> 00:21:58.100
For example, Islam,

394
00:21:58.720 --> 00:22:01.060
lambasting of the peasants wall were seen by some of his followers to be a

395
00:22:01.061 --> 00:22:04.000
betrayal of his own work and alienated many.

396
00:22:04.180 --> 00:22:07.990
There was also bad luck such as Frederick, the wise, his death in 1525,

397
00:22:07.991 --> 00:22:10.000
which robs Luther of his greatest patron.

398
00:22:10.090 --> 00:22:13.690
Still Lisa never quite managed to slip into total obscurity.

399
00:22:13.780 --> 00:22:16.240
He still works on his German translation of the Bible,

400
00:22:16.241 --> 00:22:18.940
a project that would help codify the rest in German language.

401
00:22:19.000 --> 00:22:21.730
He also took part in drafting, the Augsburg confession,

402
00:22:21.731 --> 00:22:26.310
the 1530 document that solidified the splits between Lutherans and reformists,

403
00:22:26.330 --> 00:22:28.660
although it was far from the only author,

404
00:22:28.780 --> 00:22:33.430
but mostly he settled down marrying an ex naan and slowly drifting into ever

405
00:22:33.431 --> 00:22:36.850
matter theories. That was his growing anti-Semitism for example,

406
00:22:36.851 --> 00:22:40.720
which saw him cool for pogroms and the burning of Jewish homes and texts.

407
00:22:40.721 --> 00:22:44.110
So vitriolic later inspired the Nazis less violence,

408
00:22:44.140 --> 00:22:48.370
but also OD was his public support for polygamy, for his non horny,

409
00:22:48.371 --> 00:22:53.200
non antisemitic admirers. This was embarrassing in the extreme.

410
00:22:53.320 --> 00:22:57.760
You can always hear them quietly rooting for him to just get on with us and dies

411
00:22:57.820 --> 00:23:02.290
or they can focus on the good stuff and ignore the crazy racist uncle shtick.

412
00:23:02.790 --> 00:23:07.540
Mozley finally obliged them on February the 18th, 1546 dead at age 62,

413
00:23:07.541 --> 00:23:09.520
he was buried in the same, which in bag church,

414
00:23:09.521 --> 00:23:13.870
it's supposedly nailed his 95 theses to nearly 30 years earlier.

415
00:23:14.020 --> 00:23:14.680
By this time,

416
00:23:14.680 --> 00:23:17.620
his effect on history was already undeniable just before his death.

417
00:23:17.650 --> 00:23:20.800
The council of trends had convened kicking off the counter reformation.

418
00:23:20.890 --> 00:23:22.660
A decade later in 1555,

419
00:23:22.661 --> 00:23:26.440
the peace of Augsburg would formally recognize Protestants in the Holy Roman

420
00:23:26.441 --> 00:23:26.980
empire,

421
00:23:26.980 --> 00:23:31.120
allowing each individual ruler to choose between Lutheranism and Catholicism for

422
00:23:31.121 --> 00:23:35.470
his people. But this would just be hitting the pause button. 60 years later,

423
00:23:35.500 --> 00:23:39.280
the unresolved tensions of the era would explode into the religious chaos of the

424
00:23:39.281 --> 00:23:39.881
30 years.

425
00:23:39.881 --> 00:23:44.530
War per capita is still one of the deadliest Wars ever fought by then though

426
00:23:44.590 --> 00:23:48.440
Martin Luther was just a memory today is near impossible to overstate.

427
00:23:48.470 --> 00:23:51.350
Just how important this one monk was.

428
00:23:51.500 --> 00:23:56.120
Protestantism remains one of the biggest branches of Christianity on earth

429
00:23:56.121 --> 00:23:59.060
itself by far the biggest religion. Well,

430
00:23:59.061 --> 00:24:02.820
not every Protestant denomination has a positive view of Luther.

431
00:24:03.080 --> 00:24:07.760
It was only thanks to his actions or in reactions to them that many of them ever

432
00:24:07.761 --> 00:24:11.360
got started. But even when you strip away the religious aspects,

433
00:24:11.420 --> 00:24:15.470
Luther remains of buying to a figure in the six or so years when he was at his

434
00:24:15.471 --> 00:24:16.310
most prominent,

435
00:24:16.340 --> 00:24:20.570
this one's obscure monk laid the foundations of the future of central and

436
00:24:20.571 --> 00:24:24.050
Western Europe. Some of that was unquestionably good.

437
00:24:24.110 --> 00:24:28.010
Some of it is like the 30 years war was questionably horrific,

438
00:24:28.100 --> 00:24:31.550
but most it's simply just wants the reformation.

439
00:24:31.551 --> 00:24:35.570
Luther sparked is by now. So apart of the Western world's DNA,

440
00:24:35.720 --> 00:24:39.050
that it's impossible to imagine a timeline in which never happens.

441
00:24:39.200 --> 00:24:42.260
Martin Luther may have simply been in the right place at the right time to spark

442
00:24:42.261 --> 00:24:44.620
these changes, but it was his own character.

443
00:24:44.830 --> 00:24:48.820
That's allowed things to play out as they did for better and for worse,

444
00:24:48.850 --> 00:24:52.480
we are still living in a world shaped by his actions.

445
00:24:52.960 --> 00:24:54.850
