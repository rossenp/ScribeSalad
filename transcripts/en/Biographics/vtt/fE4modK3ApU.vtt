<v 1>Sure.</v>

00:00:20.870 --> 00:00:23.780
<v 0>History is brimming with thousands of years of dynasties,</v>

8
00:00:23.781 --> 00:00:27.680
rebellions and civil Wars emperors came and the winds with the concrete

9
00:00:27.681 --> 00:00:32.600
predictability of its early summer rainy season dynasties Rose

10
00:00:32.990 --> 00:00:35.060
dynasties fell in nearly every case.

11
00:00:35.061 --> 00:00:39.950
Those dynasties were run by men who ruled over a vast Asian empire

12
00:00:39.951 --> 00:00:43.880
with an assortment of Hans pig, bureaucrats and concubines,

13
00:00:43.940 --> 00:00:47.000
but in the middle of China's most beloved Imperial dynasty,

14
00:00:47.210 --> 00:00:50.900
there was one woman who defied every expectation for herself.

15
00:00:50.960 --> 00:00:55.250
She Rose from a simple palace concubine to Empress of China,

16
00:00:55.280 --> 00:00:58.490
through a careful blends of understated intelligence,

17
00:00:58.760 --> 00:01:01.580
ruthless decision-making and feminine Wiles.

18
00:01:01.640 --> 00:01:05.390
These are the many names and titles of wounds.

19
00:01:12.230 --> 00:01:12.980
<v 1>[Inaudible].</v>

20
00:01:12.980 --> 00:01:17.750
<v 0>Who is primarily referenced to by her surname was born on February the 17th in</v>

21
00:01:17.751 --> 00:01:22.490
the year 624 CE it was a good time to be a citizen of Imperial China.

22
00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:26.960
This was the beginning of the Tang dynasty believed by many scholars in modern

23
00:01:26.961 --> 00:01:31.880
day, Chinese to be the greatest dynasty ever produced by Imperial China.

24
00:01:32.030 --> 00:01:34.640
The Tang emperors that perfected Chinese bureaucracy.

25
00:01:34.670 --> 00:01:39.080
Thanks in part to a series of challenging entrance exams that selected and

26
00:01:39.081 --> 00:01:43.460
recruited the most intelligent Chinese citizens and gave them jobs in the local

27
00:01:43.461 --> 00:01:45.590
or national governments. As a result,

28
00:01:45.620 --> 00:01:49.040
China was flourishing both culturally and economically.

29
00:01:49.390 --> 00:01:51.680
We came from a wealthy family. Her father was Wu.

30
00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:55.850
She whole chancellor for the emperor in the opening years of the Tang dynasty,

31
00:01:55.910 --> 00:01:59.390
her mother known as lady yang came from another powerful family.

32
00:01:59.540 --> 00:02:03.260
Even from a young age, we lived a very unusual life, a Chinese woman.

33
00:02:03.410 --> 00:02:05.510
She was educated in music and politics.

34
00:02:05.540 --> 00:02:09.230
She was also instructed in calligraphy and dabbled in a Chinese art form that

35
00:02:09.231 --> 00:02:13.520
was gaining popularity at the time poetry as was the case across the world.

36
00:02:13.521 --> 00:02:17.090
At the time, all of this education for a young girl was pretty atypical,

37
00:02:17.091 --> 00:02:22.010
but Wu's uncommon intelligence combines with a powerful family of means made

38
00:02:22.011 --> 00:02:24.620
for an atypical childhood to be short.

39
00:02:24.680 --> 00:02:29.090
As we grew up the budding Imperial mind discovered she had another huge asset at

40
00:02:29.091 --> 00:02:33.140
her disposal. She was quite beautiful. The combination of her raw intelligence,

41
00:02:33.170 --> 00:02:34.460
educational backgrounds,

42
00:02:34.461 --> 00:02:37.970
and unrivaled beauty made a quite unique and Imperial China.

43
00:02:38.330 --> 00:02:41.900
It wasn't long before she was selected for a great honor. At the age of 14,

44
00:02:41.901 --> 00:02:46.340
she was selected as the next concubine for emperor ties on now to our modern

45
00:02:46.341 --> 00:02:47.330
Western standards.

46
00:02:47.331 --> 00:02:51.500
Being plucked from one's home to live as an Imperial prostitute with special

47
00:02:51.501 --> 00:02:56.420
privileges might not sound like a huge honor, but it's an Imperial China.

48
00:02:56.420 --> 00:03:00.850
This was a big deal. Think of it like winning American beauty pageant,

49
00:03:00.910 --> 00:03:04.240
except instead of getting a million new Instagram followers and day scholarship

50
00:03:04.241 --> 00:03:07.930
to Arizona States, you got to have sex with the emperor. If you will,

51
00:03:07.931 --> 00:03:11.860
feminist sensibilities, didn't like we was forced career choice your in.

52
00:03:11.980 --> 00:03:15.670
You're not going to like this next boss. Emperor ties on has nine concubines.

53
00:03:15.671 --> 00:03:20.020
And they all had rankings as if they were college basketball teams,

54
00:03:20.050 --> 00:03:23.830
but we ranked death. She was still very beautiful,

55
00:03:23.831 --> 00:03:25.420
but emperor ties on Brevard.

56
00:03:25.421 --> 00:03:29.080
Some of his older longest standing consoles to her still.

57
00:03:29.081 --> 00:03:32.380
We enjoyed certain benefits from an early life as a teenage concubine.

58
00:03:32.410 --> 00:03:34.840
She was able to accompany ties on,

59
00:03:34.841 --> 00:03:38.950
on certain trips throughout China acting as some sort of cross between a

60
00:03:39.610 --> 00:03:42.280
girlfriend's obsessions and a secretary. When she wasn't on the road,

61
00:03:42.550 --> 00:03:45.760
she lived on the Imperial palace grounds with the other concubines in the

62
00:03:45.761 --> 00:03:48.580
capital city of Chiang on in central China.

63
00:03:48.820 --> 00:03:52.810
At one point we disappointed ties on and he considered having her killed.

64
00:03:52.840 --> 00:03:55.810
He only spent her because he felt she was too beautiful to die.

65
00:03:55.900 --> 00:03:58.630
We continue to live what it become a normal life,

66
00:03:58.780 --> 00:04:03.520
fulfilling her palace duties as a concubine does while growing closer to

67
00:04:03.521 --> 00:04:07.060
legi the youngest of emperor Ty's songs, 14 sons.

68
00:04:07.150 --> 00:04:11.800
Then when we was 25 and prioritize on died and legi replaced him as the new

69
00:04:11.801 --> 00:04:15.220
Tang dynasty emperor under the name gals song,

70
00:04:15.340 --> 00:04:19.300
while evidence does suggest that ties on and w had a sexual relationship,

71
00:04:19.480 --> 00:04:21.820
she never bought any of his children by law.

72
00:04:21.850 --> 00:04:26.320
All concubines of a deceased emperor had to leave the palace and take monastic

73
00:04:26.321 --> 00:04:26.831
vows,

74
00:04:26.831 --> 00:04:31.480
which is how the crafty Wu fell into residence at [inaudible] temple,

75
00:04:31.510 --> 00:04:34.960
where she was pledged, observed the remainder of her life as a Buddhist nun.

76
00:04:35.110 --> 00:04:35.590
However,

77
00:04:35.590 --> 00:04:40.090
a relationship with the ascendent emperor gala zone came in handy for an

78
00:04:40.120 --> 00:04:44.140
aspirational women like Wu on the anniversary of his father's death.

79
00:04:44.710 --> 00:04:46.120
Gaussian visited the Buddhist monastery,

80
00:04:46.121 --> 00:04:48.790
where we had been moved and when their eyes match,

81
00:04:48.820 --> 00:04:52.480
the story goes that they cried together and remembrance of the former emperor,

82
00:04:52.720 --> 00:04:55.240
realizing that he found Wu more Regal than ever.

83
00:04:55.270 --> 00:04:59.200
He sprung her from the monastery and took her back to the palace where she soon

84
00:04:59.201 --> 00:05:01.450
became gal. Song's favorite consort. Now,

85
00:05:01.480 --> 00:05:03.130
just before we continue with the video today,

86
00:05:03.131 --> 00:05:06.570
I do want to make quick mention today's sponsor Squarespace, couple of things.

87
00:05:06.571 --> 00:05:11.070
Maybe you've got an idea for a website or a business up there in your minds.

88
00:05:11.071 --> 00:05:13.410
And you're thinking maybe I should, maybe I should do that.

89
00:05:13.411 --> 00:05:16.290
Maybe I should start that new project. Well, too.

90
00:05:16.470 --> 00:05:19.200
The only way to figure out whether it's worth doing is to get it out there to

91
00:05:19.201 --> 00:05:19.650
the world.

92
00:05:19.650 --> 00:05:22.980
And another company don't think because it's scary to go and try new things.

93
00:05:23.490 --> 00:05:26.670
You know, not knowing how to set up a website is not an excuse.

94
00:05:26.670 --> 00:05:28.860

00:06:35.320 --> 00:06:35.560
<v 2>[Inaudible].</v>

115
00:06:35.560 --> 00:06:39.040
<v 0>Unbeknownst to we, when she first saw gals on not a Buddhist monastery,</v>

116
00:06:39.190 --> 00:06:42.760
there was a second reason that we would soon be welcomed back to the Imperial

117
00:06:42.761 --> 00:06:47.740
palace. And her name was Mrs. Wang. This is where the story of woos.

118
00:06:47.800 --> 00:06:52.480
The Chan starts to sound a bit like the plot of a George R.

119
00:06:52.480 --> 00:06:56.890
Martin novel and press Wang was the de facto wife of gal song by virtue of her

120
00:06:56.920 --> 00:07:01.750
top status. But she was an aging woman who had yet to bag gals on any children,

121
00:07:01.930 --> 00:07:04.330
the marital relationship, if you want to call it,

122
00:07:04.331 --> 00:07:08.830
that was pretty Rocky gals on preferred to spend time with a secondary

123
00:07:09.460 --> 00:07:11.710
console's named chow. Not only were our jokes funnier,

124
00:07:11.740 --> 00:07:16.420
but consult chow had made [inaudible] a father and breast Wang feared for her

125
00:07:16.421 --> 00:07:17.650
position in the panelists.

126
00:07:17.710 --> 00:07:21.460
So with a real love triangle on our hands and press Wang sought the perfect

127
00:07:21.461 --> 00:07:25.680
solution to her problem would be to reintroduce a beautiful old friends like

128
00:07:26.140 --> 00:07:27.730
woo. Back into the equation.

129
00:07:27.760 --> 00:07:31.900
Gals on could become smitten with a new console Dow until a child would be

130
00:07:32.110 --> 00:07:33.040
shoved to the side.

131
00:07:33.041 --> 00:07:36.340
And that would give Wang the opportunity she needed to cement a relationship

132
00:07:36.341 --> 00:07:40.840
with the emperor. Mrs. Wang's master plan. It worked perfectly. In fact,

133
00:07:40.870 --> 00:07:42.160
it worked a little too well.

134
00:07:42.220 --> 00:07:45.580
We have increasingly had her eyes set on seeking the power of the Chinese

135
00:07:45.581 --> 00:07:49.030
throne. Came back to the Imperial palace in China,

136
00:07:49.210 --> 00:07:51.050
two years off to Harvard town. We went,

137
00:07:51.740 --> 00:07:56.260
[inaudible] had a son of their own named Lee Hong born in 652.

138
00:07:56.530 --> 00:08:01.210
She had a second son in 653 and was pregnant with Fs daughter in

139
00:08:01.211 --> 00:08:05.170
654 and breast Wang succeeded in dislodging console,

140
00:08:05.590 --> 00:08:08.140
ciao from the emperor, but in doing so,

141
00:08:08.141 --> 00:08:12.460
she had created an even bigger threat to her position as Empress consort.

142
00:08:12.520 --> 00:08:17.200
So in 654 Empress Wang and console Shao put aside their

143
00:08:17.201 --> 00:08:21.580
differences to join forces against Wu the emperor, his favorite concubine.

144
00:08:21.730 --> 00:08:26.230
Nobody's quite sure what happens next. We gave birth to the emperor's daughter,

145
00:08:26.260 --> 00:08:28.960
but the baby died just weeks after it was delivered.

146
00:08:29.260 --> 00:08:32.620
It could have been something as simple as SIDS or crib death,

147
00:08:32.621 --> 00:08:37.000
or even carbon monoxide poisoning caused by a nearby cold burning

148
00:08:37.001 --> 00:08:41.110
fire and poor ventilation. We made more nefarious accusations.

149
00:08:41.111 --> 00:08:44.650
She suggested that Empress Wang murdered the baby out of jealousy,

150
00:08:44.651 --> 00:08:49.220
which is entirely possible when still had not born any children for the emperor

151
00:08:49.240 --> 00:08:51.700
was clearly showing animosity towards whoop.

152
00:08:51.940 --> 00:08:55.950
One popular theory in China today is centered around the image we as an

153
00:08:55.951 --> 00:08:58.050
effective, but power hungry leader,

154
00:08:58.080 --> 00:09:02.910
that school of thought suggests that we intentionally killed her own baby to see

155
00:09:02.960 --> 00:09:07.410
the grounds for powerful accusations against the woman whose job she wanted.

156
00:09:07.500 --> 00:09:08.700
However, the baby girl died.

157
00:09:08.730 --> 00:09:13.230
The aftermath was a cold war in the Imperial palace between consort and

158
00:09:13.231 --> 00:09:14.910
Empress Wang. The following year,

159
00:09:14.940 --> 00:09:18.030
we accused Wang and her mother of practicing witchcraft,

160
00:09:18.031 --> 00:09:20.670
which was a major offense in China at the time.

161
00:09:20.940 --> 00:09:23.940
And bruh gals on banished his Empress from the palace.

162
00:09:24.090 --> 00:09:28.080
We continued to gather political allies throughout Bambara bureaucracy until

163
00:09:28.081 --> 00:09:30.690
finally I was on had no other choice.

164
00:09:30.750 --> 00:09:34.020
He plays to both console chow and Empress Wang under arrest,

165
00:09:34.170 --> 00:09:38.490
stripping the latter of her title and giving it to Wu in 655.

166
00:09:38.491 --> 00:09:40.770
We became Empress columnists, saltwater, Shao,

167
00:09:40.771 --> 00:09:42.570
and Wang web left to rot in prison.

168
00:09:42.780 --> 00:09:46.290
Later that year gala song began to feel regrets about the harshness of his

169
00:09:46.291 --> 00:09:46.891
actions.

170
00:09:46.891 --> 00:09:50.790
And he considered releasing Shao and Wang and press where you're sensing they

171
00:09:50.791 --> 00:09:54.480
could become threats to a new found power. Secretly had the murdered,

172
00:09:54.630 --> 00:09:56.160
according to some sources and press.

173
00:09:56.161 --> 00:09:59.250
We ordered that the hands and feet of both women be caught off.

174
00:09:59.400 --> 00:10:03.390
She then ordered that they be thrown into a VAT of wine where they drowned and

175
00:10:03.391 --> 00:10:08.220
press. We spent the next five years, smartly consolidating a power in 656.

176
00:10:08.221 --> 00:10:12.330
She convinced gala's song to designate the eldest son, Lee Hong,

177
00:10:12.331 --> 00:10:15.150
as the crown Prince set to the throne previously,

178
00:10:15.151 --> 00:10:17.310
it had been Gallo song's oldest son,

179
00:10:17.340 --> 00:10:21.540
who he had conceived with another of his concubines after she spent years

180
00:10:21.541 --> 00:10:25.620
exiling unfriendly bureaucrats and arresting the children of rival concubines.

181
00:10:25.800 --> 00:10:30.210
We finally got a shot at wielding some real power and pro gals on wasn't a

182
00:10:30.211 --> 00:10:33.240
particularly effective realist to begin with, but by 660,

183
00:10:33.300 --> 00:10:36.840
he began to be infrequently capacitated by headaches and blankness.

184
00:10:36.870 --> 00:10:39.000
He remains in his chamber for weeks on end,

185
00:10:39.030 --> 00:10:43.080
allowing Empress Wu to meet with local officials and make rulings in his stet.

186
00:10:43.200 --> 00:10:47.460
And so Chinese bureaucrats began to plead their cases before the Empress and

187
00:10:47.790 --> 00:10:50.730
much to their shock. She was an adept ruler,

188
00:10:50.970 --> 00:10:54.000
thanks to Woo's comprehensive education. As a young girl, the adult,

189
00:10:54.001 --> 00:10:58.470
we had the necessary historical and cultural context to relate to the embars

190
00:10:58.471 --> 00:11:01.080
middle managers on a wide variety of issues.

191
00:11:01.170 --> 00:11:04.350
When Galzin returned from his health problems. After months of rest,

192
00:11:04.351 --> 00:11:08.130
he was pleasantly surprised to discover that as impressive ruled evenly and

193
00:11:08.280 --> 00:11:12.030
effectively in his stead wound knew how to make the most of our moments in power

194
00:11:12.090 --> 00:11:12.721
going forward.

195
00:11:12.721 --> 00:11:17.190
She was considered a virtual equal to Ember a gal song in terms of Regency and

196
00:11:17.191 --> 00:11:20.880
political power. I completely unprecedented and unparalleled feet.

197
00:11:21.000 --> 00:11:23.850
And most of world history let alone that of Imperial China,

198
00:11:24.150 --> 00:11:26.850
traditional Chinese wisdom and confusion schools of thoughts,

199
00:11:26.851 --> 00:11:31.440
both explicitly stated that a woman could not possibly be suited for the

200
00:11:31.441 --> 00:11:32.274
throne. Yet.

201
00:11:32.670 --> 00:11:36.810
Emperor Wu was outperforming even her own Imperial counterparts of the day.

202
00:11:36.990 --> 00:11:37.381
And for us,

203
00:11:37.381 --> 00:11:42.000
we continue to prove ourself more effective regions as the Tang dynasty fostered

204
00:11:42.001 --> 00:11:44.640
some of the greatest poets and scholars in Chinese history,

205
00:11:44.641 --> 00:11:49.410
but she also continued to show how ruthless she could be in protecting her power

206
00:11:49.560 --> 00:11:50.940
and punishing her enemies.

207
00:11:51.000 --> 00:11:54.670
Many of the stories about w have been distorted throughout the centuries after

208
00:11:54.760 --> 00:11:57.430
our death, as it was common for confusion, historians,

209
00:11:57.431 --> 00:12:01.480
to offer historical lessons to young princes in the form of parables from

210
00:12:01.481 --> 00:12:02.500
Imperial history.

211
00:12:02.770 --> 00:12:06.670
These lessons were really kind to those who use up to power and woo,

212
00:12:06.700 --> 00:12:07.900
whatever else she was.

213
00:12:08.300 --> 00:12:12.550
It was definitely a use up up after all you don't rise from fifth ranked

214
00:12:12.551 --> 00:12:15.310
concubine do Empress without, and little bit.

215
00:12:15.400 --> 00:12:17.350
If you're surfing D for that reason,

216
00:12:17.410 --> 00:12:21.940
it's hard to know how much fiction is mixed in with the facts from 1500 years

217
00:12:21.941 --> 00:12:26.530
ago. But some pretty wild stories are passed down about Wu in the

218
00:12:26.531 --> 00:12:28.210
23 year periods,

219
00:12:28.211 --> 00:12:31.990
where she reigned as the real substantive power behind the throne.

220
00:12:32.020 --> 00:12:33.280
One story recounts out,

221
00:12:33.281 --> 00:12:37.840
she consulted with a Taoist sorcerer named Xing Shen seeking to

222
00:12:37.841 --> 00:12:39.910
benefit from his knowledge of witchcraft,

223
00:12:39.940 --> 00:12:43.840
the same crime she had accused and breast Wang over so many years earlier when a

224
00:12:43.841 --> 00:12:46.180
unit reported this information. So gala zone,

225
00:12:46.210 --> 00:12:51.010
he was angry and began planning to depose was Empress console to just as he did

226
00:12:51.011 --> 00:12:51.760
with Wang,

227
00:12:51.760 --> 00:12:56.350
but we'll used a feminine charms to talk the malleable gal zone out of his

228
00:12:56.351 --> 00:12:56.890
decision.

229
00:12:56.890 --> 00:13:01.300
Instead turning his eye on the confidence who had convinced gals on do consider

230
00:13:01.301 --> 00:13:02.710
deposing her in the first place,

231
00:13:02.740 --> 00:13:06.670
three of them were killed and she forced the fourth gala songs, eldest son,

232
00:13:06.940 --> 00:13:10.540
Lee Zhang, the former crown Prince to commit suicide.

233
00:13:10.630 --> 00:13:12.490
So how about the crown Prince Lee hall?

234
00:13:12.640 --> 00:13:17.350
He was Wu's eldest son who she burst back during the first days of the war

235
00:13:17.470 --> 00:13:18.430
with Empress wag,

236
00:13:18.520 --> 00:13:22.000
homeless have been confident in his status as crown Prince and son of the

237
00:13:22.001 --> 00:13:25.780
Empress consorts because he voiced his opinion that his mother should dial back

238
00:13:25.781 --> 00:13:29.410
her interference in gals songs, court, and the affairs of the state.

239
00:13:29.470 --> 00:13:34.450
Soon after he mysteriously died, historians, believe we may have poisoned him.

240
00:13:34.570 --> 00:13:36.760
Whatever. The reason we wouldn't gals on hats,

241
00:13:36.761 --> 00:13:40.600
a name and new crown Prince selecting a youngest son DJ,

242
00:13:40.810 --> 00:13:42.880
a story from the six seventies recounts,

243
00:13:42.881 --> 00:13:47.170
how she had a falling out with a daughter-in-law the princess of Shao who was

244
00:13:47.171 --> 00:13:50.920
married to a third son, but also happened to be the emperor's cousin.

245
00:13:51.130 --> 00:13:54.130
I know that the relationship between wives and the mother-in-law can be

246
00:13:54.131 --> 00:13:54.791
complicated,

247
00:13:54.791 --> 00:13:59.470
but we chose to take out her frustration on princess jowl by accusing

248
00:13:59.471 --> 00:14:02.920
her of vague crimes with minimal evidence, arresting her,

249
00:14:03.250 --> 00:14:05.890
and then eventually starving at a death.

250
00:14:05.980 --> 00:14:09.820
When a son became understandably frustrated with his mother, killing his wife,

251
00:14:10.000 --> 00:14:12.700
she accused him of treason and exiled him,

252
00:14:12.850 --> 00:14:14.890
whatever the truth behind all these stories,

253
00:14:14.891 --> 00:14:17.310
it's clear that we was a woman who refused to,

254
00:14:17.311 --> 00:14:19.780
to dampen her ambition on account of her agenda.

255
00:14:19.990 --> 00:14:24.010
Her personal and political life may have been rocked by some behavior that would

256
00:14:24.011 --> 00:14:25.870
make Cersei Lannister blush,

257
00:14:25.900 --> 00:14:30.430
but it's hard to deny the fact that she remains an extremely effective ruler

258
00:14:30.700 --> 00:14:34.690
even while technically operating behind the ineffective gals.

259
00:14:34.691 --> 00:14:39.610
On finally in the final days of 683 CE and borough [inaudible]

260
00:14:39.640 --> 00:14:44.050
died at the age of 56, they usually assumed the throne at the age of 27.

261
00:14:51.250 --> 00:14:52.100
<v 1>Dad. She no.</v>

262
00:14:52.100 --> 00:14:55.010
<v 0>Longer rule as Empress, calm salt as the mother of the emperor.</v>

263
00:14:55.040 --> 00:14:59.960
She had a new title, Empress dowager, or queen mother, despite the title change.

264
00:15:00.080 --> 00:15:03.830
Our plan was the same rule. China as the power behind the throne,

265
00:15:04.190 --> 00:15:08.570
her son cliche was renamed as emperor Zhang Zong and the Tang dynasty

266
00:15:08.870 --> 00:15:13.100
continued on this plan, worked great for all of six weeks.

267
00:15:13.220 --> 00:15:17.060
The last will and Testament of gala zone called for his inexperienced son to

268
00:15:17.240 --> 00:15:19.850
look to his brilliance mother in the matters of state.

269
00:15:19.880 --> 00:15:24.260
But the newly crowned emperor Zhang zone was more interested in listening to his

270
00:15:24.261 --> 00:15:29.150
new wife way John's own moved to make his father-in-law the prime minister

271
00:15:29.151 --> 00:15:33.650
and began rebelling against the will of Wu a move that was candidly. Well,

272
00:15:33.680 --> 00:15:37.490
pretty stupid. We didn't blow up the septum Baylor or anything,

273
00:15:37.491 --> 00:15:41.630
but she did call on her bureaucratic allies to rectify the situation.

274
00:15:41.630 --> 00:15:46.220
Essentially unwilling her some status as emperor through sheer political

275
00:15:46.221 --> 00:15:49.850
force. Everyone involved with [inaudible] was forced into exile,

276
00:15:49.851 --> 00:15:51.800
including the promoted father-in-law.

277
00:15:51.801 --> 00:15:56.570
And we actually forced her second son lesion to commit suicide.

278
00:15:56.720 --> 00:16:01.400
All this cleared the way for our youngest and most pliable son Lee down to

279
00:16:01.401 --> 00:16:04.790
become the new emperor was able to hold onto her political power.

280
00:16:04.820 --> 00:16:06.260
First as Empress dowager,

281
00:16:06.261 --> 00:16:11.180
then as regions for the newly crowns and root zone [inaudible] was

282
00:16:11.210 --> 00:16:13.670
a true puppet. He was not allowed to go to court.

283
00:16:13.671 --> 00:16:17.330
Officials were barred from meeting with him and he played no part in the affairs

284
00:16:17.331 --> 00:16:19.550
of state in 685.

285
00:16:19.820 --> 00:16:23.420
We've had a mass absolute power over the Chinese empire ruse on for his part.

286
00:16:23.421 --> 00:16:26.750
It learns a great deal from watching his mother and older brothers.

287
00:16:26.960 --> 00:16:31.130
His mother offered him the full Imperial powers of his position in 686.

288
00:16:31.131 --> 00:16:35.930
And he wisely denied being interested in obtaining them in any meaningful way

289
00:16:36.620 --> 00:16:39.590
on was savvy enough to understand what many others did not.

290
00:16:40.160 --> 00:16:43.670
We was never going to give up our power and to being a toothless emperor was

291
00:16:43.671 --> 00:16:47.270
still much better than, you know, being sent to live in exile.

292
00:16:47.300 --> 00:16:48.860
During a decade as queen mother,

293
00:16:48.890 --> 00:16:53.360
we began to see local rebellions that chafed against her continued consolidation

294
00:16:53.361 --> 00:16:53.900
of power.

295
00:16:53.900 --> 00:16:58.340
One exile in Eastern China drew great public support for his mutinous conflicts

296
00:16:58.490 --> 00:17:03.020
prompting one adviser to point out that we could dissolve the whole conflict by

297
00:17:03.230 --> 00:17:06.620
returning power to our son and brewery zone strategically.

298
00:17:06.650 --> 00:17:08.510
It was a wise observation politically.

299
00:17:08.511 --> 00:17:11.210
It was the sort of thing you never wanted to say out loud to whoop.

300
00:17:11.420 --> 00:17:12.920
She arrested the advisor,

301
00:17:12.950 --> 00:17:15.770
took down the names of everyone who spoke out in his defense,

302
00:17:15.771 --> 00:17:18.590
then arrested them to and executed the lot of them.

303
00:17:18.620 --> 00:17:20.270
We began installing beautiful,

304
00:17:20.300 --> 00:17:23.810
ornate copper mailboxes outside our palaces and other official government

305
00:17:23.811 --> 00:17:27.800
buildings so that people could anonymously report dangerous behavior. She put,

306
00:17:28.040 --> 00:17:32.210
inadvertently created a medieval four runner to the Chinese secret police,

307
00:17:32.211 --> 00:17:36.380
which she used to hunt down and exile or kill the scores of people she believed

308
00:17:36.381 --> 00:17:37.700
were rising up against her.

309
00:17:37.820 --> 00:17:41.120
It was the cap on decades of harsh authoritarian actions,

310
00:17:41.121 --> 00:17:42.950
many of which are difficult to defend,

311
00:17:42.980 --> 00:17:47.330
but it's important to remember that that young girl born [inaudible] has a

312
00:17:47.331 --> 00:17:50.010
massive obstacle to overcome her womanhood.

313
00:17:50.160 --> 00:17:53.340
No woman had ever risen to the throne of Imperial China,

314
00:17:53.341 --> 00:17:57.120
and she knew that she had to maintain a ruthless edge that never dolls.

315
00:17:57.360 --> 00:18:00.630
If she wanted to formally sit on the throne before her death,

316
00:18:00.810 --> 00:18:03.480
the secret police was the final stepping up plan.

317
00:18:03.570 --> 00:18:07.530
She used the information from the copper mailboxes to arrest and eliminate a

318
00:18:07.531 --> 00:18:11.920
political enemies, regardless of how accurate the information was by 690,

319
00:18:12.000 --> 00:18:15.420
she had removed anyone who might consider voicing opposition to our queen

320
00:18:15.421 --> 00:18:19.830
shepherds, thus peacefully deposed her final son, seizing formal power.

321
00:18:20.400 --> 00:18:23.190
We wish it was no longer the defacto Empress of China.

322
00:18:23.370 --> 00:18:28.320
She was the first and only Monarch and assumed a more appropriate title.

323
00:18:29.070 --> 00:18:29.903
Woozy tan,

324
00:18:36.440 --> 00:18:40.610
The rules for most of our life as the power behind Tang embers were herself was

325
00:18:40.611 --> 00:18:44.240
not of the Tang dynasty as such. When she ascended the throne,

326
00:18:44.241 --> 00:18:46.700
she declared herself to be the wounds yet. Jan,

327
00:18:46.730 --> 00:18:49.250
the first Ambrose of the new Shao dynasty,

328
00:18:49.280 --> 00:18:54.050
the dynasty would last for 15 years until the end of her life from 690 to seven

329
00:18:54.140 --> 00:18:56.930
Oh five. By the time we formally became Empress regnant,

330
00:18:56.931 --> 00:19:00.770
she was already 66 and advanced age, particularly for the seventh century,

331
00:19:00.830 --> 00:19:04.730
much of her rule as Ambrose regnant mirrored her earlier decades at court,

332
00:19:04.790 --> 00:19:08.690
she poisoned exiles and killed political opponents to maintain a position while

333
00:19:08.870 --> 00:19:11.150
making smart economic decisions for the embark.

334
00:19:11.390 --> 00:19:15.920
She faced military challenges from Bango tribes to the North and the Tibetan men

335
00:19:16.220 --> 00:19:18.560
part of the South while she didn't soundly defeat,

336
00:19:18.590 --> 00:19:23.000
either force China did continue to thrive. Even if it was through a bit of luck,

337
00:19:23.060 --> 00:19:27.470
the Mongo tribes were defeated by a third party from the steps and the Tibetan

338
00:19:27.471 --> 00:19:30.050
government crumbled from within. And I find all years,

339
00:19:30.051 --> 00:19:32.510
palace injury focused on Wu's line of succession.

340
00:19:32.750 --> 00:19:36.170
Many of the bureaucrats in the Imperial Wells felt that we should designate a

341
00:19:36.530 --> 00:19:37.970
Tang edge to restore the dynasty.

342
00:19:38.030 --> 00:19:42.680
While her family pushed to formalize we family power by passing power to a blood

343
00:19:42.681 --> 00:19:45.140
relative, strangely, she seemed to favor neither option.

344
00:19:45.141 --> 00:19:47.990
Instead favoring a pair of young brothers named Zhang,

345
00:19:47.991 --> 00:19:50.270
Yeezy and Zhang Chang Jong.

346
00:19:50.420 --> 00:19:53.630
These brothers may have been serving her as younger sexual partners over the

347
00:19:53.631 --> 00:19:55.640
course of our 15 years as Empress remnants.

348
00:19:55.641 --> 00:19:58.970
They slowly grew in power until one day in the spring of 705,

349
00:19:58.971 --> 00:20:00.740
CE the bureaucrats around,

350
00:20:01.040 --> 00:20:04.610
we could no longer allow her to groom these two randos to be our success at,

351
00:20:04.640 --> 00:20:08.840
we was 81 years old and in poor health and finally a coup against her worked out

352
00:20:08.900 --> 00:20:11.390
an Alliance of Wu family members, Chinese generals,

353
00:20:11.391 --> 00:20:13.190
and politically savvy bureaucrat storms.

354
00:20:13.190 --> 00:20:17.270
The palace murdered the Jang brothers and seized the throne from Wu who has

355
00:20:17.271 --> 00:20:20.360
moved on to go and do a location in the palace. In the following days,

356
00:20:20.361 --> 00:20:24.050
the crew released a statement and we was named that Paolo had written to a third

357
00:20:24.051 --> 00:20:28.400
son, Lee Shan, who had ruled for six weeks as emperor zone.

358
00:20:28.520 --> 00:20:30.320
He returned to the throne for five years. They,

359
00:20:30.321 --> 00:20:32.960
one of Wu's nephews continued to challenge them for power,

360
00:20:33.410 --> 00:20:35.300
whereas removal restored the Tang dynasty,

361
00:20:35.301 --> 00:20:37.100
which flourished for another 200 years.

362
00:20:37.101 --> 00:20:39.950
Thanks in large part to we use intelligent leadership.

363
00:20:40.070 --> 00:20:43.280
Her own attempts at a dynasty is contested by many historians.

364
00:20:43.460 --> 00:20:47.060
Traditional Chinese historians recognize the second child dynasty,

365
00:20:47.200 --> 00:20:49.660
the jowl restoration, but many considerate,

366
00:20:49.690 --> 00:20:53.440
nothing more than an interlude in the much more politically impactful Tang

367
00:20:53.470 --> 00:20:57.190
timeline. Since the term dynasty explicitly calls for more than one roulette,

368
00:20:57.370 --> 00:21:00.010
we were self died later that year in December of seven Oh five,

369
00:21:00.160 --> 00:21:04.660
she was interred with a former defacto husband and borough gals song at the

370
00:21:05.110 --> 00:21:07.870
jingling mausoleum outside of the Imperial capital.

371
00:21:08.350 --> 00:21:12.490
Wu's effective rain and raffle palace demeanor are still controversial today.

372
00:21:12.550 --> 00:21:17.290
Centuries of stories twisted by sexism and confusion bosses painted Wu as a

373
00:21:17.980 --> 00:21:21.460
bloodthirsty Empress whose only goal was power, but modern takes on a life,

374
00:21:21.520 --> 00:21:25.570
a more nuanced recognizing both the violence methods and her skill.

375
00:21:25.630 --> 00:21:28.120
As a governor, often we use death in 7.5.

376
00:21:28.240 --> 00:21:31.930
It didn't take long for another woman to attempt to follow the wounds yet 10

377
00:21:31.940 --> 00:21:34.450
playbook and press consort way wife of embryos,

378
00:21:34.840 --> 00:21:37.750
Zhang Zong poisoned her husband and attempted to seize power.

379
00:21:37.930 --> 00:21:41.500
She sees the throne alongside her daughter, but only for a matter of hours,

380
00:21:42.070 --> 00:21:45.340
accrue Rose up in opposition to our COO and she was killed hours later.

381
00:21:45.430 --> 00:21:46.690
It was a nice dry bus.

382
00:21:47.170 --> 00:21:50.470
Not quite enough after all the throne couldn't be seized by any women.

383
00:21:50.530 --> 00:21:53.290
It took a special blends of smarts, beauty ambition,

384
00:21:53.291 --> 00:21:56.830
and cruelty to become the Chinese Empress and to no one had that.
