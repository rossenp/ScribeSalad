If you click the link in the description below that's for the first 500 people,

00:00:18.950 --> 00:00:20.440
only more on them in a bit

7
00:00:26.950 --> 00:00:28.230
In February, 1865,

8
00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:33.110
an Augustinian frost stood up before a small crowd in the Moravian city of

9
00:00:33.550 --> 00:00:37.150
Breno and delivered a lecture that changed the course of history for the last

10
00:00:37.550 --> 00:00:41.660
eight years, Greg or Mendel had been cultivating peas in at his garden.

11
00:00:42.050 --> 00:00:46.700
Each plant had been carefully selected for its characteristics like tall or

12
00:00:46.701 --> 00:00:48.180
short or yellow or green,

13
00:00:48.200 --> 00:00:52.980
and then painstakingly crossbred to create generations of

14
00:00:53.130 --> 00:00:57.380
hybrids. There was always not just a shed load of peas, but a whole new science.

15
00:00:57.840 --> 00:01:02.530
It was from Mendel's notes that the entire concept of genetic sprang,

16
00:01:02.610 --> 00:01:06.610
a branch of biology that would fundamentally change our understanding of the

17
00:01:06.611 --> 00:01:08.570
world. But here's the kicker.

18
00:01:08.910 --> 00:01:13.370
No one would realize what a breakthrough Mendel had made for another 35 years.

19
00:01:13.790 --> 00:01:15.130
At the time he delivered his lecture,

20
00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:20.250
Greg or Mendel was middle aged anonymous and virtually unknown outside of

21
00:01:20.730 --> 00:01:24.000
BRINO in his lifetime, it traveled little experienced less,

22
00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:26.840
and mostly just lived in his a yet.

23
00:01:26.950 --> 00:01:30.680
Somehow this nobody single handedly made one of the greatest

24
00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:34.720
discoveries in history today on biographics.

25
00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:39.480
We are delving into the life and the minds of Greg or Mendel and

26
00:01:39.760 --> 00:01:43.670
discovering how this one monk formed our world

27
00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:51.710
Of all the branches of science.

28
00:01:51.870 --> 00:01:56.270
Genetics may be unique in that it can be traced back to a single person,

29
00:01:56.490 --> 00:01:58.470
but if your vision of a man, so brain,

30
00:01:58.530 --> 00:02:02.750
he can uncover whole new sciences is some wild head.

31
00:02:03.170 --> 00:02:04.100
Rick star genius,

32
00:02:04.410 --> 00:02:07.820
lording it over the simpletons around him repair to be disappointed.

33
00:02:08.090 --> 00:02:12.060
Greg will Menzel. Wasn't just a modest man. He came from a background so modest.

34
00:02:12.500 --> 00:02:14.420
He nearly didn't study signs at all.

35
00:02:14.530 --> 00:02:18.340
Born Johan Mendel on the 22nd of July,

36
00:02:18.340 --> 00:02:20.620
1822 young Mendel was the son of farming.

37
00:02:21.100 --> 00:02:25.690
Parents seeking out a living in the Salus in modern day Czech Republic.

38
00:02:25.950 --> 00:02:28.610
At that time, this was still a part of the Austrian empire.

39
00:02:28.670 --> 00:02:32.490
One of the great powers of Europe and Mendel grew up speaking German,

40
00:02:32.790 --> 00:02:37.410
but since nearly every location in our story has long since lost its German

41
00:02:37.480 --> 00:02:37.780
name.

42
00:02:37.780 --> 00:02:42.130
We're just gonna use the modern CZE names when referring to places that way,

43
00:02:42.131 --> 00:02:45.520
if you wanna look stuff up later, you'll actually be able to find it.

44
00:02:45.520 --> 00:02:49.280
And also I'll do a whole lot better job pronouncing it menthol and his parents

45
00:02:49.470 --> 00:02:52.400
life in remote Silesia wasn't exactly easy.

46
00:02:52.740 --> 00:02:57.440
The family was always teetering on the edge of financial catastrophe and

47
00:02:57.800 --> 00:02:58.760
ma and par Harbor.

48
00:02:59.060 --> 00:03:03.680
No great dreams for their son beyond having him grow up and help run the farm

49
00:03:03.910 --> 00:03:08.800
that may very well have been Mendel's fate had it not been for

50
00:03:08.860 --> 00:03:11.200
one man when Mendel was aged 11,

51
00:03:11.220 --> 00:03:15.200
the village priest who also doubled as the local school master came to the

52
00:03:15.201 --> 00:03:18.950
family farm asking for a meeting there. He told Mr. And Mrs.

53
00:03:19.590 --> 00:03:24.390
Mendel that their son was exceptionally bright indeed alarmingly. So in fact,

54
00:03:24.450 --> 00:03:27.830
the school master said Mendel was so clever that he should be allowed to

55
00:03:28.070 --> 00:03:29.350
continue his education. Now,

56
00:03:29.351 --> 00:03:33.750
this wouldn't exactly have been music to the families ears in the Austrian

57
00:03:33.751 --> 00:03:35.990
empire, sending a child off secondary education,

58
00:03:35.991 --> 00:03:39.900
often involved paying fees that most families simply couldn't manage.

59
00:03:40.420 --> 00:03:42.420
Bob Mendel's parents weren't dirt poor.

60
00:03:42.450 --> 00:03:47.420
They also couldn't afford to spend crazy money on something as nebulous as

61
00:03:47.740 --> 00:03:51.660
learning, but the school master insisted and eventually the family caved.

62
00:03:51.720 --> 00:03:53.900
And so it was that in 1834,

63
00:03:53.960 --> 00:03:58.860
Mendel left his village for the first time and went to study in a Parva for the

64
00:03:58.861 --> 00:04:01.050
gifted country boy, life in industrial,

65
00:04:01.410 --> 00:04:05.850
a Parva wasn't exactly what you'd call enjoyable in a real city.

66
00:04:05.851 --> 00:04:06.684
For the first time,

67
00:04:06.850 --> 00:04:10.690
mental failed to fit in or adapt to the pressures that he felt to succeed.

68
00:04:10.910 --> 00:04:14.130
He frequently fell ill plunging into deep dark depressions.

69
00:04:14.131 --> 00:04:16.490
That would keep him from studying days.

70
00:04:16.670 --> 00:04:21.120
It was the first flicker of the disease that would come to haunt Mendel for his

71
00:04:21.121 --> 00:04:25.520
entire life. But those black days were still in the future.

72
00:04:26.070 --> 00:04:29.320
Despite the strain at school Mendel graduated in 1840,

73
00:04:29.380 --> 00:04:31.760
having excelled in his studies. In fact,

74
00:04:31.761 --> 00:04:36.360
he did so well that his parents allowed him to continue to university in Almas,

75
00:04:36.600 --> 00:04:37.640
a small, beautiful city.

76
00:04:37.880 --> 00:04:42.630
I meant the rolling Hills of Moravia Almas in is less than 70 kilometers from

77
00:04:42.790 --> 00:04:47.550
a par, but must have felt like a weld away gone was the industrial

78
00:04:48.310 --> 00:04:52.990
try of Silesia replaced by clear air and Barack majesty,

79
00:04:53.130 --> 00:04:55.710
but even such Instagram ready surroundings.

80
00:04:55.711 --> 00:05:00.630
Couldn't stave off Mendel's black thoughts while at all Mars Mendel's mental

81
00:05:00.631 --> 00:05:03.460
health that came close to total collapse twice.

82
00:05:03.480 --> 00:05:07.580
He had depressive episode so deep that he dropped out of his mouth studies sling

83
00:05:07.650 --> 00:05:11.940
back to his disappointed parents both times though he eventually recovered

84
00:05:11.941 --> 00:05:16.340
enough to return to Almas, but even then money worries left him badly.

85
00:05:16.430 --> 00:05:17.263
Overworked,

86
00:05:17.540 --> 00:05:21.500
forced to tutor alongside his studies just to make enough money to eat. But he,

87
00:05:21.570 --> 00:05:24.770
he made it through in 1843, Mendo graduated.

88
00:05:25.110 --> 00:05:29.530
His parents must have breathed sigh relief. Finally, their son was coming home,

89
00:05:29.990 --> 00:05:34.970
but home was the last thing on Mendel's mind depressed as had been in Almar sea

90
00:05:35.140 --> 00:05:36.210
still wanted to study.

91
00:05:36.430 --> 00:05:40.410
He just needed a way to do so without any financial pressure suffocating him.

92
00:05:40.480 --> 00:05:44.680
Luckily in the Austrian empire of the mid 19th century, such a way existed.

93
00:05:50.260 --> 00:05:55.120
One of the strangest things about Mendel's life story is just how much of it was

94
00:05:55.121 --> 00:05:58.800
made possible by other people at every important moment,

95
00:05:58.930 --> 00:06:02.480
there was someone there to push in in the right direction.

96
00:06:02.481 --> 00:06:04.480
Someone like the village school,

97
00:06:04.720 --> 00:06:09.320
master someone to like Abbot Franek NA and

98
00:06:09.321 --> 00:06:13.920
Augustinian NA deeply believed in the creed dictum per sym at

99
00:06:14.600 --> 00:06:15.010
Sapian,

100
00:06:15.010 --> 00:06:19.750
which means from to wisdom as head of the ABB and the great

101
00:06:19.751 --> 00:06:23.470
industrial city of Breo. Some 60 kilometers from Alemar sit,

102
00:06:23.660 --> 00:06:26.350
devoted his life to building a center for study.

103
00:06:26.610 --> 00:06:29.030
He supported his monks in scientific endeavors,

104
00:06:29.031 --> 00:06:32.990
helps them get university placements without paying Feest for Mendel.

105
00:06:33.140 --> 00:06:36.670
This was exactly what he needed in 1843. He joins the order,

106
00:06:37.120 --> 00:06:39.540
taking the name Gregor for the rest of his life.

107
00:06:40.060 --> 00:06:44.460
Mendel would be based in naps AIE and Bruno. And speaking of Bruno it's time,

108
00:06:44.640 --> 00:06:48.100
we got to know the place that Mendel called home. The Czech Republic.

109
00:06:48.200 --> 00:06:52.060
Second city Bruno today has a reputation for being pleasantly boring,

110
00:06:52.360 --> 00:06:53.820
the sort of place. Well,

111
00:06:53.850 --> 00:06:58.490
life is a steady procession of Sunday afternoons back in the mid 19th century,

112
00:06:58.491 --> 00:07:00.690
though, it was an industrial powerhouse,

113
00:07:00.890 --> 00:07:05.890
a multicultural center where vast German check and Jewish communities rubbed

114
00:07:05.891 --> 00:07:10.170
shoulders from this melting point would spring mines such as earnest mark and

115
00:07:10.650 --> 00:07:15.210
Kurt Gole or musical talents such as leash Y check someone else whose

116
00:07:15.310 --> 00:07:18.960
talent was spotted by Abbot Napa, by the way, in short,

117
00:07:19.190 --> 00:07:22.880
this was the exact right place, that the exact right time,

118
00:07:23.460 --> 00:07:28.400
if he wanted to change the world, not the Mendel of any inkling of his destiny,

119
00:07:28.750 --> 00:07:32.960
just yet. In fact, his first years at the Abbey seemed almost to be a mistake.

120
00:07:32.990 --> 00:07:37.240
Part of Mendel's duties after being ordained was to visit the sick and dying of

121
00:07:37.720 --> 00:07:42.030
Brio to for them comfort. But country, boy Mendel found the booming city.

122
00:07:42.210 --> 00:07:44.990
So overwhelming and the lives of the poor there.

123
00:07:45.050 --> 00:07:49.990
So sad and squalled that he started to crack apart in 1849,

124
00:07:50.170 --> 00:07:51.470
he had another breakdown.

125
00:07:51.500 --> 00:07:55.150
This one plunging him so deep into the black ocean at the bottom of his mind

126
00:07:55.460 --> 00:07:58.070
that it took nearly a year for him to recover.

127
00:07:58.240 --> 00:08:02.580
Thankfully ABAP was super enlightened where mental health was concerned.

128
00:08:02.760 --> 00:08:07.540
He gave men space to recover and then quietly assigned him to a much less taxing

129
00:08:07.541 --> 00:08:12.060
job teaching and the much less forensic nearby town of Sonomo for Menzel.

130
00:08:12.330 --> 00:08:15.700
This seems like the perfect combination. He didn't just recover.

131
00:08:15.850 --> 00:08:20.690
Inno Mo he flourished sadly though. It wasn't meant to. In 1850,

132
00:08:20.830 --> 00:08:24.170
the Austrian empire suddenly shook up its education system.

133
00:08:24.290 --> 00:08:28.530
Teachers could no longer teach just because they were clever and needed work.

134
00:08:28.560 --> 00:08:32.130
They now needed a qualification to set foot in a classroom.

135
00:08:32.510 --> 00:08:34.370
And you could probably guess what happened next.

136
00:08:34.790 --> 00:08:37.810
The strain of the exam caused Mendel's nerves to come back,

137
00:08:37.840 --> 00:08:40.880
leaving him unable to continue teaching. At this point,

138
00:08:40.940 --> 00:08:45.240
it must have looked like the young man was destined for nothing more than a life

139
00:08:45.241 --> 00:08:49.520
of battling his illness with only the occasional Ray of sunshine,

140
00:08:49.560 --> 00:08:53.080
breaking in to keep him going. But Abbo inhab thought differently.

141
00:08:53.300 --> 00:08:54.840
The following year, 1851,

142
00:08:54.841 --> 00:08:58.280
he encouraged Mendel to enroll at the university of Vienna,

143
00:08:58.281 --> 00:09:01.560
which was just opening brand new courses on science.

144
00:09:01.860 --> 00:09:04.800
It seems the Abbot hope to give Mendel something, to focus on,

145
00:09:04.860 --> 00:09:07.520
to distract him from his problems. Instead,

146
00:09:07.540 --> 00:09:10.560
he wounds up handing Mendel the keys to his future.

147
00:09:11.020 --> 00:09:15.470
Now you might not be heading off to Vienna to you science,

148
00:09:15.730 --> 00:09:19.710
but there is no reason you shouldn't improve your skills and keep learning

149
00:09:20.390 --> 00:09:23.510
whatever stage you're at in your career or your life.

150
00:09:23.690 --> 00:09:27.710
And that's where today's sponsor. Skillshare comes into the picture. Now,

151
00:09:27.770 --> 00:09:31.350
unlike some websites where you have to pay for individual classes with a premium

152
00:09:31.351 --> 00:09:32.670
membership from Skillshare,

153
00:09:32.810 --> 00:09:35.860
you essentially get unlimited access all of their classes.

154
00:09:36.080 --> 00:09:39.700
So you can take as many as you want, whatever you wanna learn,

155
00:09:40.240 --> 00:09:43.260
go check out skills, share. You'll be able to do it on there.

156
00:09:43.360 --> 00:09:46.140
I'm someone who will just jump into a particular part of a class.

157
00:09:46.460 --> 00:09:49.820
They'll be like, I wanna learn that specific thing on that specific topic. Now,

158
00:09:50.040 --> 00:09:52.180
if I didn't have unlimited access to all of the classes,

159
00:09:52.360 --> 00:09:55.020
I'd have to pay you for that whole class just so I can watch the one,

160
00:09:55.140 --> 00:09:57.730
but that I wanna watch. That's not how it works with skill.

161
00:09:58.230 --> 00:10:01.770
You just pay a fixed fee per month, unlimited access.

162
00:10:01.771 --> 00:10:04.370
It's all like the buffet of online classes.

163
00:10:04.790 --> 00:10:07.770
Now I've talked about some classes I've taken before and I'd still recommend

164
00:10:07.780 --> 00:10:11.450
those. I took a class on email productivity from Alexandra, Samuel,

165
00:10:12.030 --> 00:10:15.530
and I took another course on just building good habits with Thomas Frank.

166

There is a link below and let's get back to the video.

173
00:10:46.810 --> 00:10:50.230
If Greg or Menzel thought a Parva and Bruno were big.

174
00:10:50.250 --> 00:10:53.830
We can't imagine how he must have felt when he first saw Vienna the capital of

175
00:10:53.831 --> 00:10:58.380
an empire that stretched all the way from the Alps to the car pay Athens 19th

176
00:10:58.381 --> 00:11:03.220
century Vienna was one of Europe's greatest cities under the new emperor

177
00:11:03.540 --> 00:11:04.180
friends, Joseph,

178
00:11:04.180 --> 00:11:07.700
it would soon grow to become a cultural and artistic powerhouse,

179
00:11:07.920 --> 00:11:11.500
but if Mendel found the sprawling multiethnic city overwhelming,

180
00:11:12.120 --> 00:11:14.700
he never showed it. His two years studying in the capital,

181
00:11:15.260 --> 00:11:19.330
passed calmly without a hints of the mental stress that had accompanied such

182
00:11:19.380 --> 00:11:20.213
moves before.

183
00:11:20.220 --> 00:11:24.530
Maybe the difference this time was that Mendel was able to get fully involved in

184
00:11:24.531 --> 00:11:28.530
his courses rather than worrying about how to make money in order to pay for

185
00:11:28.531 --> 00:11:33.250
them and what courses they were Mendel studied experimental physics under C

186
00:11:33.560 --> 00:11:37.810
Doppler of Doppler effect fame and practical biology under Fran Z.

187
00:11:38.600 --> 00:11:39.440
Although forgotten today,

188
00:11:39.800 --> 00:11:42.880
UNGA was a leading light of Austrian biology in the 1850s.

189
00:11:42.980 --> 00:11:45.840
And his closest equivalent is rich Dawkins.

190
00:11:46.560 --> 00:11:51.000
UNGA was a huge proponent of the pre Darwinian evolutionary theory of

191
00:11:51.150 --> 00:11:55.600
hybridization, which rejected church doctrine in favor of a natural,

192
00:11:55.980 --> 00:11:59.840
if incorrect theory of how animals evolved naturally,

193
00:12:00.440 --> 00:12:04.600
this made him a huge hate figure among the devout and UNGA spends the entire

194
00:12:04.601 --> 00:12:05.060
period.

195
00:12:05.060 --> 00:12:09.560
He tutored Mendel fighting off attacks in the popular press yet for all of the

196
00:12:10.040 --> 00:12:12.360
flack that UNGA caught from the hardcore religious,

197
00:12:12.440 --> 00:12:16.150
he doesn't seem to have repulsed the monk Mendel at all. In fact,

198
00:12:16.290 --> 00:12:20.430
he appears to have inspired him the year after he graduated and returns of Bruno

199
00:12:20.710 --> 00:12:24.230
1854 Mendel approached Abbot nap with a plan.

200
00:12:24.410 --> 00:12:26.990
He wanted to run a hybridization experiment in the,

201
00:12:26.991 --> 00:12:30.150
a likely the biggest the world had ever seen at the time.

202
00:12:30.550 --> 00:12:35.220
That was a huge disconnect between what was the about hybrids and what

203
00:12:35.370 --> 00:12:40.180
practical experience told you the orthodoxy was that an animal was

204
00:12:40.181 --> 00:12:43.140
an animal and it didn't change no matter what.

205
00:12:43.360 --> 00:12:46.300
So if you had say a Labrador and a poodle,

206
00:12:46.301 --> 00:12:48.820
they might produce one hybrid offspring,

207
00:12:48.821 --> 00:12:52.820
but future generations would revert back to being separate species,

208
00:12:53.160 --> 00:12:56.970
but that didn't tally with the lived experience of animal breeders,

209
00:12:56.971 --> 00:13:00.450
who were like, well, dude, look at all these Labradoodles,

210
00:13:00.780 --> 00:13:02.370
where do you think they come from?

211
00:13:03.040 --> 00:13:07.130
What was needed was someone with time and patience and mathematical training to

212
00:13:07.280 --> 00:13:11.570
investigate this problem across thousands of specimens and multiple generations

213
00:13:11.630 --> 00:13:14.680
in order to figure out exactly what was, is going on.

214
00:13:14.950 --> 00:13:19.760
Someone like Greg or Mendel initially Mendel wanted to run his gigantic

215
00:13:19.790 --> 00:13:21.160
experiments on mice,

216
00:13:21.300 --> 00:13:25.760
but perhaps realizing that experimental genetic research and things with teeth

217
00:13:25.780 --> 00:13:30.320
sounds like the setup for a terrible horror movie Abbo app

218
00:13:30.321 --> 00:13:33.960
refused, which is how Mendel came to settle on these thing.

219
00:13:33.980 --> 00:13:37.310
We know for peas starting in 1856,

220
00:13:37.630 --> 00:13:39.590
Greg or Mendel spent eight years breeding,

221
00:13:39.591 --> 00:13:44.070
different types of peas and meticulously recording the results by one county

222
00:13:44.590 --> 00:13:46.830
bread and analyzed over 30,000 separate plants.

223
00:13:47.250 --> 00:13:50.870
If that sounds like an extremely boring way to spend the best part of a decade,

224
00:13:51.420 --> 00:13:52.830
well, no arguments there,

225
00:13:53.050 --> 00:13:57.660
but the effect it would have would be anything but dull. In a short time,

226
00:13:57.690 --> 00:14:01.580
this one monk working in his garden was going to overhaul everything.

227
00:14:02.240 --> 00:14:03.900
The biologists thought they knew.

228
00:14:10.040 --> 00:14:13.580
If you're wondering now why nobody had bothered to do this research before,

229
00:14:13.920 --> 00:14:17.970
why you all the only one Mendel and self seemed flabbergasted by the lack of

230
00:14:17.971 --> 00:14:22.250
scientific interest writing that no one has concentrated on the number of

231
00:14:22.251 --> 00:14:25.690
different forms that appear among the offspring of hybrids.

232
00:14:25.830 --> 00:14:29.210
No one has arranged these forms into their separate generations.

233
00:14:29.830 --> 00:14:32.770
No one has counted them, but there may have been a good reason for that.

234
00:14:32.910 --> 00:14:36.010
The work Mendel undertook was almost painfully tedious.

235
00:14:36.340 --> 00:14:40.680
The first stage was ment to select varieties of peace to cultivate it wound up

236
00:14:40.800 --> 00:14:44.480
choosing seven types with binary characteristics that were easy to detect,

237
00:14:44.740 --> 00:14:48.440
for example, tall or short, yellow or green. And so on.

238
00:14:48.510 --> 00:14:51.240
This was important because people looking into hybrids,

239
00:14:51.460 --> 00:14:55.320
pre Mendel had been all like, well, okay, these are all way different.

240
00:14:55.570 --> 00:14:58.120
Let's cross breed them and kind of just see what happens.

241
00:14:58.580 --> 00:15:01.920
But Mendel scientific training made him more rigorous.

242
00:15:02.060 --> 00:15:05.600
He only wanted to cross breed those with opposing characteristics,

243
00:15:05.940 --> 00:15:06.800
at least at first.

244
00:15:07.180 --> 00:15:11.150
So that meant making sure the tall plants spread with the short ones that the

245
00:15:11.151 --> 00:15:15.350
yellow ones BR with the green ones, it must have been insanely fiddly work,

246
00:15:15.570 --> 00:15:19.990
the sort of work that would make most people question their choices in life.

247
00:15:20.250 --> 00:15:21.710
Yet Mendel kept it up.

248
00:15:21.930 --> 00:15:26.390
He kept it up across eight whole years across uncountable

249
00:15:26.420 --> 00:15:30.950
generations of P hybrids. And slowly patterns began to,

250
00:15:31.300 --> 00:15:34.020
we merge let's take flower color. As an example,

251
00:15:34.200 --> 00:15:38.420
one of the varieties Mendel worked with was pee plants that flowered either

252
00:15:38.470 --> 00:15:41.740
white or purple Mendel noticed that when he cross bred them,

253
00:15:41.760 --> 00:15:44.380
the next generation of plants all had purple flowers.

254
00:15:44.760 --> 00:15:47.620
It was almost like the whites that never existed,

255
00:15:47.840 --> 00:15:50.740
but when Mendel took those hybrids and kept right on,

256
00:15:50.741 --> 00:15:54.490
breeding them something interesting happened in the subsequent generation,

257
00:15:54.500 --> 00:15:56.850
white flowers, reappeared, not many,

258
00:15:56.950 --> 00:16:00.890
but roughly around 25% of the new generation of hybrids.

259
00:16:00.990 --> 00:16:04.410
It was from this observation that Mendel's greatest work was born.

260
00:16:04.550 --> 00:16:08.410
We don't want to get too far into the weeds with this where a history channel,

261
00:16:08.730 --> 00:16:09.510
not a science channel,

262
00:16:09.510 --> 00:16:14.000
but we'll give you the bare bones version of Mendel's conclusions.

263
00:16:14.340 --> 00:16:16.400
The first was that certain traits, uh,

264
00:16:16.401 --> 00:16:19.800
what he called dominance like the purple flowers. In our example,

265
00:16:19.850 --> 00:16:23.280
while others are recessive, like the white flowers,

266
00:16:23.450 --> 00:16:27.120
these traits were passed down at random from parent to child.

267
00:16:27.340 --> 00:16:30.800
The second was that these traits were all passed down independently of other

268
00:16:30.860 --> 00:16:34.230
traits. So just because a eFlow trait was passed down,

269
00:16:34.231 --> 00:16:38.830
didn't mean that a tall plant trait necessarily came with it or whatever

270
00:16:39.150 --> 00:16:42.870
Mendel's third and final insight was that you could graft a basic statistical

271
00:16:42.871 --> 00:16:47.070
framework onto this to predict what traits might show up across the population.

272
00:16:47.330 --> 00:16:51.550
It was from these key conclusions that the entire idea of genetics would

273
00:16:51.551 --> 00:16:55.740
eventually be born. Not that Mendo realized this,

274
00:16:56.140 --> 00:16:58.940
although he theorized his findings could be applied to any living thing.

275
00:16:58.960 --> 00:17:03.900
He seems to have repeatedly missed the implications in 1862. For example,

276
00:17:04.080 --> 00:17:07.980
he read Charles Darwin's on the origin of species without ever twigging that

277
00:17:08.380 --> 00:17:11.100
their work could be combined to explain. So,

278
00:17:11.640 --> 00:17:16.530
so much about existence yet Menzel wasn't so unworldly that he just

279
00:17:16.600 --> 00:17:20.690
kept his findings for the ay. He still wanted to tell people about his work.

280
00:17:21.120 --> 00:17:24.810
It's just a shame that when the time came, no one was listening

281
00:17:31.030 --> 00:17:31.970
In 1861.

282
00:17:32.530 --> 00:17:37.080
Gregor Menzel had co-founded the natural science society in Bruno conceived as a

283
00:17:37.081 --> 00:17:38.440
place to discuss new ideas,

284
00:17:38.441 --> 00:17:41.520
as well as an outlet for any work it's like-minded members did,

285
00:17:41.740 --> 00:17:45.600
the society soon became a key part of Bruno's intellectual life.

286
00:17:45.740 --> 00:17:49.880
It also gave Mendel a useful place for revealing his breakthrough.

287
00:17:49.910 --> 00:17:54.520
That revelation came on February the eighth, 1865, that cold evening,

288
00:17:54.700 --> 00:17:58.880
the society converged on a building in central Bruno there as the freezing

289
00:17:58.881 --> 00:18:03.760
members huddled around the stove Mendel gave the first of two presentations on

290
00:18:03.761 --> 00:18:07.600
its findings. The title was experiments in plant hybrids,

291
00:18:07.601 --> 00:18:10.790
and it ran who a mere 47 pages written down.

292
00:18:10.930 --> 00:18:15.150
It wasn't designed to be ostentatious, but it was revolutionary.

293
00:18:15.290 --> 00:18:19.550
It seems those attending knew at two Mendel's two lectures became the talk of

294
00:18:20.030 --> 00:18:24.270
Bruno's scientific circles yet for some strange reason words never spread beyond

295
00:18:24.370 --> 00:18:28.390
the Moravian cap. It wasn't for a lack of trying the society published.

296
00:18:28.390 --> 00:18:33.220
Mendel's like as a book in 1866 and sent reprints to libraries

297
00:18:33.240 --> 00:18:34.260
across the empire,

298
00:18:34.570 --> 00:18:37.780
they even sent a translated version to Charles Darwin in England.

299
00:18:37.800 --> 00:18:41.820
But Darwin simply did is what everybody did with Mendel's book.

300
00:18:41.840 --> 00:18:46.420
He just put it to one side and forgot all about it. The trouble was,

301
00:18:46.640 --> 00:18:50.770
it just appeared so boring. I mean, great of book on breeding peas.

302
00:18:50.830 --> 00:18:55.610
Thanks &lt;laugh&gt; even those that did read Mendel's work often came away thinking

303
00:18:55.611 --> 00:18:59.770
it was applicable only to the vegetable garden. So it was interesting.

304
00:19:00.030 --> 00:19:01.770
If you were a horticulturalist,

305
00:19:02.110 --> 00:19:04.650
it did help that Menor refused to promote his own work,

306
00:19:04.651 --> 00:19:07.610
seemingly resigning himself to not being understood.

307
00:19:07.830 --> 00:19:09.810
He told a colleague in 1866,

308
00:19:10.360 --> 00:19:14.120
I knew that the results I obtained were not easily compatible with our

309
00:19:14.121 --> 00:19:15.960
contemporary scientific knowledge,

310
00:19:16.560 --> 00:19:20.960
but perhaps the biggest reason Mendel's work fell into obscurity was loss.

311
00:19:21.300 --> 00:19:23.040
In summer 1867,

312
00:19:23.330 --> 00:19:27.560
Abbot Erna passed away aged 74. It was a real blow,

313
00:19:27.740 --> 00:19:29.400
not just to the AB itself,

314
00:19:29.780 --> 00:19:33.950
but to Briner hole with one of the great intellectual lights of the city gone.

315
00:19:34.190 --> 00:19:36.990
The far looked desperately for a replacement.

316
00:19:36.991 --> 00:19:38.950
Someone who could take over from NA,

317
00:19:39.100 --> 00:19:42.630
they found their man in Greg or Mendel in 1868,

318
00:19:42.650 --> 00:19:46.710
Mendel became Abbots of naps old a it was a great promotion.

319
00:19:46.890 --> 00:19:47.750
The sort of life,

320
00:19:47.810 --> 00:19:52.540
the poor farm boy from Silesia could never have dreamed of leading as a younger

321
00:19:52.600 --> 00:19:52.821
man.

322
00:19:52.821 --> 00:19:57.580
Unfortunately it was also a life cramed with responsibilities with no free time

323
00:19:57.581 --> 00:20:00.060
left mental abandoned, his scientific pursuits.

324
00:20:00.200 --> 00:20:03.980
His peas were forgotten his lectures discarded from his mind.

325
00:20:04.440 --> 00:20:07.380
And that was it for the rest of his story.

326
00:20:07.480 --> 00:20:12.290
It feels cruel to skip over a whole 16 years of a man life like

327
00:20:12.291 --> 00:20:12.550
that.

328
00:20:12.550 --> 00:20:16.930
But really there's nothing much for us to say from the moment he became Abbot

329
00:20:17.410 --> 00:20:20.570
Mendel did nothing of note. He got older, his eyesight failed.

330
00:20:20.571 --> 00:20:23.330
He contracted Bright's disease and lived in some pain.

331
00:20:23.331 --> 00:20:27.730
And he spent the last years of his life fighting the Austria-Hungarian state

332
00:20:27.731 --> 00:20:30.690
over new taxes, LEED on monasteries.

333
00:20:31.040 --> 00:20:34.440
When he finally on January the sixth, 1884,

334
00:20:34.620 --> 00:20:39.240
he was remembered not as a scientist, but as a familiar face around Bruno,

335
00:20:39.390 --> 00:20:41.480
nothing more, nothing less.

336
00:20:42.060 --> 00:20:46.760
If people had been taking bets on his name being remembered in over 130 years

337
00:20:46.830 --> 00:20:49.760
time, you would've got fantastic arts.

338
00:20:49.990 --> 00:20:54.000
Sometimes a long shot comes in. It would take decades more,

339
00:20:54.060 --> 00:20:56.120
but Mendel would eventually become famous

340
00:21:02.790 --> 00:21:03.623
Curiously.

341
00:21:03.760 --> 00:21:07.790
The one person who seems to have been certain Mendel's name would live on was

342
00:21:08.230 --> 00:21:10.270
Mendel himself before he died. He wrote to a friends,

343
00:21:10.730 --> 00:21:13.870
my scientific studies have afforded me great gratification,

344
00:21:14.250 --> 00:21:18.590
and I am convinced that it will not be long before the whole world acknowledges

345
00:21:18.650 --> 00:21:19.950
the results of my work.

346
00:21:20.090 --> 00:21:24.430
He soon turned out to be more right than even he could have guessed the

347
00:21:24.431 --> 00:21:25.670
rediscovery of Mendel.

348
00:21:25.990 --> 00:21:29.820
And the start of his influence on the world came about in 1900,

349
00:21:30.090 --> 00:21:34.540
that year three separate scientists, all separately published work on hybrids.

350
00:21:34.541 --> 00:21:39.460
That was suspiciously similar to mens. We say suspiciously because even today,

351
00:21:40.040 --> 00:21:44.020
no, one's quite sure what happened. The official story is that Hugo dere,

352
00:21:44.540 --> 00:21:48.770
Karl Eric CORs and Eric Che Markon says sag. All declared.

353
00:21:49.130 --> 00:21:52.730
They'd made a breakthrough only to be astonished when proof was found that

354
00:21:52.830 --> 00:21:55.810
Mendel had done the same decades earlier, however,

355
00:21:56.170 --> 00:21:59.850
there's evidence each of these men may have read Mendel's book prior to their

356
00:22:00.130 --> 00:22:04.330
research and may have independently decided it was exactly obscure enough to

357
00:22:04.690 --> 00:22:08.600
steel without them being noticed, regardless of how it had happens, though,

358
00:22:08.920 --> 00:22:12.040
their papers made the scientific community turned back to Mendel's work for the

359
00:22:12.041 --> 00:22:15.720
first time in 34 years, and what they found blew their minds.

360
00:22:15.940 --> 00:22:20.280
It was clear to people living in the 20th century that Mendel had hit on

361
00:22:20.281 --> 00:22:23.320
something big. One of his new acolytes, William Bateson,

362
00:22:23.321 --> 00:22:28.240
even coined a name for what Mendel had studied genetics in no time at all.

363
00:22:28.870 --> 00:22:32.590
Mendel was all the rage while the serious scientific community turned its nose

364
00:22:32.610 --> 00:22:34.350
up at the new science for several years.

365
00:22:34.820 --> 00:22:39.790
More breakthroughs soon made the field respectable with that Mendel's legacy

366
00:22:40.370 --> 00:22:44.510
was secured today. Greg or Mendel is remembered as the father of genetics.

367
00:22:44.511 --> 00:22:47.750
The man from whose work everything in the discipline Springs,

368
00:22:47.880 --> 00:22:51.380
incredible as Mendel's work is though. What's more incredible.

369
00:22:51.590 --> 00:22:55.500
Maybe that it happened at all. Looking back across his life story,

370
00:22:55.980 --> 00:22:57.660
you can see that Mendel was one of those people.

371
00:22:57.661 --> 00:23:02.580
History seems destined into completely passed by his life was so sheltered.

372
00:23:02.680 --> 00:23:07.540
So anonymous that even the biggest events of the day barely touched upon him.

373
00:23:07.820 --> 00:23:10.930
I mean, this guy lived through the 8 48 revolutions.

374
00:23:11.140 --> 00:23:15.170
We've done enough 19th century videos by now to know that anyone who lived

375
00:23:15.171 --> 00:23:19.570
through 1848 had their lives changed by it, but not Mendel.

376
00:23:19.750 --> 00:23:21.930
He simply kept on working at the Abbey,

377
00:23:22.120 --> 00:23:26.530
tending to the gardens just as he did when pressure invaded Bruno in

378
00:23:26.730 --> 00:23:27.563
1866,

379
00:23:27.720 --> 00:23:32.480
just as he did when the Austrian empire trans formed into Austria Hungary a year

380
00:23:32.481 --> 00:23:33.180
later,

381
00:23:33.180 --> 00:23:37.680
it says something when a man can pass through history while leaving such little

382
00:23:37.830 --> 00:23:38.663
mark on it,

383
00:23:39.040 --> 00:23:43.000
and it makes you think who's to save is not another Greg or Menzel out there

384
00:23:43.001 --> 00:23:43.834
right now,

385
00:23:44.040 --> 00:23:48.400
utterly anonymous to all the members of one little society

386
00:23:49.160 --> 00:23:49.900
in the minor city.

387
00:23:49.900 --> 00:23:54.560
He lives in beavering away at research that will one day utterly

388
00:23:54.840 --> 00:23:55.800
transform our lives.

389
00:23:56.220 --> 00:24:00.800
The story of Greg or Mandel then is not just the story of one man

390
00:24:01.020 --> 00:24:05.070
and his peas. It's the story of how ideas per cyst,

391
00:24:05.250 --> 00:24:07.350
how great breakthroughs can survive.

392
00:24:07.351 --> 00:24:10.550
Even when the minds behind them dies in obscurity,

393
00:24:10.700 --> 00:24:15.630
Greg or Mendel is rightly famous today who the next Mendel might be and what

394
00:24:15.631 --> 00:24:18.510
life changing research they may be doing. Well,

395
00:24:18.730 --> 00:24:21.670
that's something we will have to wait and see.

396
00:24:22.370 --> 00:24:25.380
