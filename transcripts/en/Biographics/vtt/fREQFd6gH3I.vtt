00:00:00.090 --> 00:00:01.380
<v 0>During the American civil war,</v>

2
00:00:01.410 --> 00:00:05.040
the country was embroiled in so much fighting that it's astounding,

3
00:00:05.041 --> 00:00:07.260
that the country still exists today, though.

4
00:00:07.560 --> 00:00:11.100
Fight was more profound than the struggle for black slaves to finally earn their

5
00:00:11.101 --> 00:00:14.490
freedom. After all the staunch belief from the American South,

6
00:00:14.491 --> 00:00:17.580
that they had a right to own slaves was a primary force in the war,

7
00:00:17.581 --> 00:00:18.690
beginning in the first place,

8
00:00:18.691 --> 00:00:22.890
but even decades before the war highlighted the need for America to end slavery,

9
00:00:23.190 --> 00:00:25.920
many people were finding ways to get slaves to freedom.

10
00:00:26.100 --> 00:00:30.360
Harriet Tubman went above and beyond, but that's just one part of how rich

11
00:00:43.190 --> 00:00:47.540
Harriet Tubman was born in the month of March 18, 22 in Dorchester County,

12
00:00:47.541 --> 00:00:49.940
Maryland. Her birth name was Arameans Ross,

13
00:00:49.941 --> 00:00:53.120
and she was affectionately known as minty during our childhood.

14
00:00:53.210 --> 00:00:57.770
She was also born into slavery as a parent's Harriet and Ben worked a plantation

15
00:00:57.771 --> 00:01:00.470
near the Blackwater river in Dorchester. Obviously,

16
00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:03.260
records are hard to come by and regarding Harriet's birth,

17
00:01:03.290 --> 00:01:08.180
but historians have reached the year of 1822 as probable for a birth based

18
00:01:08.181 --> 00:01:10.070
on documents. From the time though,

19
00:01:10.071 --> 00:01:14.510
her gravestone still says 1820 and she herself says that it was 1825.

20
00:01:14.690 --> 00:01:18.050
We also don't know a lot about our family other than the fact that our

21
00:01:18.051 --> 00:01:20.660
grandmother arrived in America around a slave ship.

22
00:01:20.690 --> 00:01:24.170
As a mother was a cook for Mary brought us who oversaw the plantation.

23
00:01:24.260 --> 00:01:27.620
Her father looked over all the timber production. The couple had nine children,

24
00:01:27.621 --> 00:01:30.800
including Harriet's, but found it harder and harder to keep the family together.

25
00:01:31.120 --> 00:01:33.440
As slavery's massive reach encroached,

26
00:01:33.530 --> 00:01:36.920
three of their daughters were sold off losing touch with the family forever.

27
00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:38.300
But when they came to sell off,

28
00:01:38.301 --> 00:01:41.420
one of their sons Harriet's mother boldly stood up and refused.

29
00:01:41.690 --> 00:01:45.200
Mary brought S shockingly broadest relented, and the sale was canceled.

30
00:01:45.680 --> 00:01:48.620
Harriet saw this defiance and she was inspired by it.

31
00:01:49.010 --> 00:01:52.280
Harry is eventually he was given work as a nurse made when she was five or six,

32
00:01:52.281 --> 00:01:54.770
while also helping to raise some of our siblings.

33
00:01:54.860 --> 00:01:57.530
She also worked for a local planter named James Cook,

34
00:01:57.531 --> 00:02:01.820
and she would often work his property checking muskrat traps throughout marshes

35
00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:03.110
that dotted his land.

36
00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:07.310
They worked so hard even when she got measles and had to be careful by her

37
00:02:07.340 --> 00:02:11.240
already busy mother and nurse may task back at the plantation was much harder

38
00:02:11.241 --> 00:02:14.000
than she could have anticipated regular with things would occur.

39
00:02:14.001 --> 00:02:16.280
Even for simple things like a baby crying,

40
00:02:16.820 --> 00:02:20.780
Harry already was developing clever ways to avoid the pain and the beatings like

41
00:02:20.870 --> 00:02:24.330
wearing extra layers of clothing and just playing running away for days on.

42
00:02:31.100 --> 00:02:31.250
<v 1>[Inaudible].</v>

43
00:02:31.250 --> 00:02:34.970
<v 0>It's time, Tubman was given more arduous tasks like plowing and holding logs.</v>

44
00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:37.010
She was easing into our teenage years.

45
00:02:37.011 --> 00:02:39.620
And even though her home was one of the most horrible places,

46
00:02:39.621 --> 00:02:42.080
you could imagine it was still all she had.

47
00:02:42.081 --> 00:02:45.440
And she tried to find whatever small piece there that she could Tubman was

48
00:02:45.441 --> 00:02:49.460
unable to read, but knew the Bible and its teachings quite well from my mother,

49
00:02:49.670 --> 00:02:53.480
that religious strength was seemed to be tested as she suffered a nasty injury

50
00:02:53.481 --> 00:02:56.210
on the plantation around the time of her adolescence.

51
00:02:56.390 --> 00:02:58.190
As another slave was attempting to escape.

52
00:02:58.191 --> 00:03:00.970
One of the plantation supervisors threw a metal weight at them,

53
00:03:00.971 --> 00:03:03.520
which instead struck Harriet in the hat.

54
00:03:03.580 --> 00:03:07.240
The injury was profound and not only led to her suffering seizures and

55
00:03:07.241 --> 00:03:08.470
excruciating headaches,

56
00:03:08.471 --> 00:03:11.440
but it led to a period of having what she said were visions.

57
00:03:11.560 --> 00:03:14.740
She began to reject the ideas in the new Testament of the Bible,

58
00:03:14.741 --> 00:03:17.920
and instead pursued tales of revolution and freedom.

59
00:03:18.130 --> 00:03:20.950
Whether the injury caused this change in our mind is unknown,

60
00:03:20.980 --> 00:03:25.360
but the symptoms remained with her to her dying day and recent historians think

61
00:03:25.361 --> 00:03:28.000
she might've had a form of epilepsy after the attack.

62
00:03:28.030 --> 00:03:30.370
Harriet reached a first roadblock to freedom early.

63
00:03:30.610 --> 00:03:32.950
That was a practice back then called nanometer,

64
00:03:32.980 --> 00:03:35.980
which is an agreement where an owner formerly frees a slave.

65
00:03:36.190 --> 00:03:40.240
Oftentimes this came about when a slave reached an age where the owners felt

66
00:03:40.270 --> 00:03:44.290
they had gotten all possible use out of them physically and mentally Harriet's

67
00:03:44.291 --> 00:03:47.500
parents was supposed to be granted manometer at the age of 45,

68
00:03:47.501 --> 00:03:50.440
but their owners all but ignored that when they took over.

69
00:03:50.560 --> 00:03:53.830
So besides her parents being denied some small semblance of freedom,

70
00:03:53.980 --> 00:03:56.290
Harriet too, would remain in slavery.

71
00:03:56.440 --> 00:03:59.950
She did barrier free black man named John Tubman in 1844.

72
00:03:59.980 --> 00:04:03.430
And that wasn't so strange around those parts of Maryland back then I really

73
00:04:03.431 --> 00:04:04.690
enjoy straddled the line.

74
00:04:04.690 --> 00:04:08.020
And so roughly half the black population in those regions were free.

75
00:04:08.230 --> 00:04:10.030
That didn't matter to the law marches.

76
00:04:10.031 --> 00:04:13.420
Harriet would still remain a slave regardless of a marriage status.

77
00:04:13.600 --> 00:04:16.840
She did choose a tree name soon after no longer was she airman to Ross.

78
00:04:16.841 --> 00:04:20.190
She was now Harriet Tubman. Uh, health was still an issue. However,

79
00:04:20.500 --> 00:04:24.190
whether that was directly from the head injuries and subsequent symptoms is

80
00:04:24.191 --> 00:04:25.024
unclear.

81
00:04:25.090 --> 00:04:27.970
Her owners were beginning to consider her reliability and it's not having the

82
00:04:27.971 --> 00:04:30.700
value that she wants. How does a worker in 1849,

83
00:04:30.730 --> 00:04:34.960
they tried to sell Harriet off and found a tankers and remained humble escaping

84
00:04:34.961 --> 00:04:37.510
from her real-world is into the piece of prayer,

85
00:04:37.660 --> 00:04:39.640
even asking forgiveness for our owners,

86
00:04:39.740 --> 00:04:42.850
that line of prep eventually changed to asking for the Lord to take him,

87
00:04:42.851 --> 00:04:44.380
which actually happened a week later.

88
00:04:44.620 --> 00:04:47.710
The death of Rona instantly put her life in immediate disarray.

89
00:04:47.860 --> 00:04:50.680
Where would she end up? What would become a family?

90
00:04:50.770 --> 00:04:53.950
The thought of spending another day as the property of someone else made Harriet

91
00:04:53.951 --> 00:04:56.110
to sign the breaking free was the only option.

92
00:05:02.880 --> 00:05:02.940
<v 1>September.</v>

93
00:05:02.940 --> 00:05:06.720
<v 0>Oh, the 17, 1849 Harriet's. And two of her brothers may bear great escape.</v>

94
00:05:06.900 --> 00:05:09.000
Their absence went unnoticed for two weeks,

95
00:05:09.001 --> 00:05:11.190
which should have bought them a nice cushion of time.

96
00:05:11.400 --> 00:05:15.300
But the news then got announced in the local paper and her two brothers became

97
00:05:15.301 --> 00:05:18.870
fearful eventually returning to the plantation Harry that's of the faithful

98
00:05:18.871 --> 00:05:22.950
family member joins them, but this was just the trial run various.

99
00:05:23.220 --> 00:05:27.540
She was going to get out not long after Harriet busted out again this time

100
00:05:27.541 --> 00:05:28.800
without her brothers in tow,

101
00:05:28.950 --> 00:05:32.400
she wanted to make sure that her family knew she was planning this and sent them

102
00:05:32.401 --> 00:05:33.960
coded messages through song.

103
00:05:34.020 --> 00:05:38.340
She traveled by night with the stars as our guide and utilizing the underground

104
00:05:38.341 --> 00:05:41.730
railroad, which was a loose network of activists and former slaves.

105
00:05:41.940 --> 00:05:44.700
While little is known about which direction she took,

106
00:05:44.701 --> 00:05:47.370
it's likely she followed the nearby Choptank river,

107
00:05:47.550 --> 00:05:51.300
then went North through Delaware and Pennsylvania eventually ending up in

108
00:05:51.301 --> 00:05:52.080
Philadelphia.

109
00:05:52.080 --> 00:05:55.740
The underground railroad was a ticket to avoid capture rewards for fugitive

110
00:05:55.741 --> 00:05:56.820
slaves were plentiful,

111
00:05:56.821 --> 00:06:00.290
but so too were people who were eager to be on the right side of history.

112
00:06:00.350 --> 00:06:01.250
The railroad, well,

113
00:06:01.400 --> 00:06:05.660
not actually any kind of transit system was a series of houses and safe houses,

114
00:06:05.690 --> 00:06:07.730
which extended as far North, as Canada.

115
00:06:07.910 --> 00:06:11.660
And as far South as Mexico it's origins go back to the late 17 hundreds.

116
00:06:11.661 --> 00:06:13.100
And by the time the civil war began,

117
00:06:13.101 --> 00:06:16.640
it's estimated that over a hundred thousand slaves found their freedom through

118
00:06:16.670 --> 00:06:18.710
the underground railroad. The North star,

119
00:06:18.711 --> 00:06:20.180
which Harriet followed to Philadelphia,

120
00:06:20.330 --> 00:06:24.080
became a kind of crucial mapping points leading the way North to the free

121
00:06:24.081 --> 00:06:24.860
States.

122
00:06:24.860 --> 00:06:28.850
There was even a spiritual song at the time called follow the drinking gourd,

123
00:06:28.880 --> 00:06:32.510
which was referencing the big dip of constellation and code,

124
00:06:32.511 --> 00:06:35.720
and basically giving directions for slaves to find their freedom. Hurry.

125
00:06:35.721 --> 00:06:39.110
It used these same clues and markets to find a way,

126
00:06:39.111 --> 00:06:41.060
but a journey wasn't without peril.

127
00:06:41.090 --> 00:06:44.510
She had to hide by day and then use the cover of night to find the next friendly

128
00:06:44.511 --> 00:06:47.960
location. Some people at our stops how to pretend to work for the family.

129
00:06:47.970 --> 00:06:51.140
So as not to blow her cover, when she finally crossed into Pennsylvania,

130
00:06:51.170 --> 00:06:54.350
after in 90 miles, several week track on foot, she said,

131
00:06:54.440 --> 00:06:56.090
when I found that I had crossed that line,

132
00:06:56.180 --> 00:06:58.760
I looked at my hands to see if I was the same person.

133
00:06:58.910 --> 00:07:00.800
There was such a glory over everything,

134
00:07:00.830 --> 00:07:04.010
but someone came like a gold through the trees and over the fields.

135
00:07:04.220 --> 00:07:05.780
And I felt like I was in heaven.

136
00:07:12.510 --> 00:07:13.600
It was free for now,

137
00:07:13.630 --> 00:07:17.980
but a family wasn't neither was the over 3 million other slaves in the United

138
00:07:17.980 --> 00:07:18.010
States,

139
00:07:18.010 --> 00:07:22.750
Congress in 1850 tightens penalties on aiding slaves and escaping and forced

140
00:07:22.751 --> 00:07:25.870
authorities to help capture them, even if it was in a free state,

141
00:07:25.900 --> 00:07:28.510
even in the relative safety of Philadelphia, where Harry,

142
00:07:28.511 --> 00:07:32.830
it was poor Irish immigrants and blacks were embroiled in racial tensions of

143
00:07:32.840 --> 00:07:33.700
jobs and work.

144
00:07:34.240 --> 00:07:37.180
Harriet was able to find some odd jobs here and there and save a little bit of

145
00:07:37.181 --> 00:07:40.720
money while she thought up ways to get our people. That own tastes of freedom.

146
00:07:40.780 --> 00:07:43.030
She didn't have to wait long in December,

147
00:07:43.030 --> 00:07:46.750
1850 word reached her that her niece Casar and two children were about to be put

148
00:07:46.751 --> 00:07:49.030
up for sale back in Cambridge, Maryland Tubman,

149
00:07:49.060 --> 00:07:52.300
headed to Baltimore and blade low with a family member until the sale date,

150
00:07:52.540 --> 00:07:55.720
John BOLI was Cassano's husband, and it was a free black man.

151
00:07:55.750 --> 00:07:59.140
He was able to put up with a winning bid fab. When the man running the auction,

152
00:07:59.350 --> 00:08:01.590
went off to have lunch, belly snuck, OSI,

153
00:08:01.600 --> 00:08:03.730
and the children to a safe house until nightfall.

154
00:08:03.940 --> 00:08:08.200
He then loaded them all onto a canoe and sailed 60 miles up to Baltimore where

155
00:08:08.201 --> 00:08:10.210
Harriet was waiting to take them to Philadelphia.

156
00:08:10.270 --> 00:08:12.220
This was her first successful rescue,

157
00:08:12.340 --> 00:08:15.000
but it was far from my lost in spring 1851.

158
00:08:15.010 --> 00:08:17.980
She had it to Maryland again to rescue her brother Moses.

159
00:08:18.010 --> 00:08:21.520
She was becoming more confident in our travels and word was beginning to spread

160
00:08:21.521 --> 00:08:25.210
around the region and to a family of our exploits and the fall of that year.

161
00:08:25.211 --> 00:08:29.410
She actually returned to the home County of Dorchester this time to attempt to

162
00:08:29.411 --> 00:08:33.180
rescue her husband's John Tubman, unbeknownst to her John had remarried still.

163
00:08:33.190 --> 00:08:35.620
She tried to persuade him to follow how to save for pots.

164
00:08:35.800 --> 00:08:39.310
John was adamant that he was happy with his new life and his new wife.

165
00:08:39.311 --> 00:08:43.060
And though Harriet was upset. She designed it. It was best to leave him behind.

166
00:08:43.120 --> 00:08:46.810
She instead found some slaves in the neighboring area who did want to escape and

167
00:08:46.990 --> 00:08:50.740
took them back to Philadelphia. With that in December, she escorted 11 more.

168
00:08:51.040 --> 00:08:52.210
Those 11 slaves,

169
00:08:52.240 --> 00:08:56.340
she rescued are a special note because it's very likely she led them to freedom

170
00:08:56.370 --> 00:08:58.890
after they were under the care of Frederick Douglas.

171
00:08:58.950 --> 00:09:02.910
He stated in his autobiography that he was looking after 11 slaves at his home.

172
00:09:02.911 --> 00:09:06.150
And the timing of her leading that number of fugitives seems to match up

173
00:09:06.180 --> 00:09:09.360
perfectly Douglas and Tubman already had a great respect for each other,

174
00:09:09.390 --> 00:09:12.930
or is he was a former slave before becoming the prominent abolitionist.

175
00:09:12.931 --> 00:09:16.140
You know, today he eventually wrote a very poignant letter in her honor,

176
00:09:16.141 --> 00:09:16.800
remarking,

177
00:09:16.800 --> 00:09:20.730
how he very publicly denounced slavery while she fought it privately Harriet

178
00:09:20.731 --> 00:09:24.570
Tubman led 13 Voyagers back to Maryland in all rescuing some 70 slaves and

179
00:09:24.571 --> 00:09:28.170
leading them North to safety. She saved even more of her family, her brothers,

180
00:09:28.171 --> 00:09:29.220
their wives and children.

181
00:09:29.370 --> 00:09:32.880
She counseled with many other slaves directing them before they embarked on

182
00:09:32.881 --> 00:09:36.000
their own perilous trips to freedom. She mostly worked during the winter.

183
00:09:36.210 --> 00:09:39.420
As those climates seem to offer the least chances being course,

184
00:09:39.570 --> 00:09:43.740
she ends up passengers usually took off on a Saturday nights as runaway notices.

185
00:09:43.741 --> 00:09:46.710
Wouldn't be put into newspapers until Monday morning, Aria devised,

186
00:09:46.711 --> 00:09:49.350
all sorts of tricks and tactics to avoid detection.

187
00:09:49.380 --> 00:09:51.260
Sometimes she would carry angry chickens.

188
00:09:51.261 --> 00:09:53.910
So she wouldn't have to make eye contact with plantation owners,

189
00:09:53.970 --> 00:09:55.170
even though she was illiterate,

190
00:09:55.171 --> 00:09:58.830
she would Fain reading newspapers so passes by wouldn't catch on to her mission.

191
00:09:59.100 --> 00:10:00.360
She also carried a gun with her.

192
00:10:00.420 --> 00:10:03.540
This wasn't just for protection against people who would love to have caught her

193
00:10:03.541 --> 00:10:04.740
and gotten their award.

194
00:10:04.890 --> 00:10:08.310
It was also to make sure no one she was rescuing would have second thoughts

195
00:10:08.311 --> 00:10:09.900
about being rescued after all,

196
00:10:09.901 --> 00:10:12.660
if someone had tried to back out that would have put the safety of the whole

197
00:10:12.661 --> 00:10:15.990
group in jeopardy, it was known around those regions of Maryland,

198
00:10:16.020 --> 00:10:18.300
that someone was helping a good number of slaves escape,

199
00:10:18.390 --> 00:10:20.130
but they never got wise to it being Tubman.

200
00:10:20.160 --> 00:10:24.030
They figured she had escapes and gotten to a better place and have no reason to

201
00:10:24.031 --> 00:10:27.510
return many thoughts. White abolitionists were behind all the escapes,

202
00:10:27.511 --> 00:10:30.720
but for all of her daring expeditions into the belly of the beast,

203
00:10:30.721 --> 00:10:35.190
including where she herself had toiled in slavery, she was never once caught.

204
00:10:35.460 --> 00:10:39.150
One of her very last trips was to steal into Maryland and rescue her parents in

205
00:10:39.151 --> 00:10:39.961
1855.

206
00:10:39.961 --> 00:10:43.470
Her father had purchased the rights to our mother and both lived as free blacks,

207
00:10:43.500 --> 00:10:47.970
but the area still wasn't the kindest place for them to reside in 1857,

208
00:10:48.060 --> 00:10:51.480
the father got in trouble for being found, protecting eight slaves in his home.

209
00:10:51.960 --> 00:10:55.410
Harriet saw the danger he was facing and headed down to Maryland for one last

210
00:10:55.411 --> 00:10:56.850
mission. She picked her parents up,

211
00:10:57.060 --> 00:11:01.140
led them all the way to Ontario Canada and got them situated on a piece of labs

212
00:11:01.150 --> 00:11:04.260
that also included her brothers and many other former slaves.

213
00:11:04.660 --> 00:11:08.700
Harry found a way to reunite much of a family after being separated by so many

214
00:11:08.701 --> 00:11:10.110
forces for so long.

215
00:11:10.190 --> 00:11:11.023
<v 2>Yeah.</v>

216
00:11:16.220 --> 00:11:20.270
<v 0>Harriet Tubman cross paths with another famous anti-slavery force in 1858,</v>

217
00:11:20.271 --> 00:11:23.810
when she was introduced to John Brown and abolitionists to advocated for armed

218
00:11:23.811 --> 00:11:24.980
revolt against slavery.

219
00:11:25.010 --> 00:11:28.610
You may remember his name being attached to the famous raid on Harper's ferry in

220
00:11:28.611 --> 00:11:29.480
1859.

221
00:11:29.540 --> 00:11:32.990
He and his group seized a federal armory with the intention of arming slaves

222
00:11:33.020 --> 00:11:34.880
while the raid was first successful.

223
00:11:35.000 --> 00:11:37.430
It didn't last long and Brown and his men were captured.

224
00:11:37.490 --> 00:11:41.420
John Brown was actually the first person convicted of treason in us history.

225
00:11:41.690 --> 00:11:44.150
And he was hanged Brown and Tubman were fast friends,

226
00:11:44.151 --> 00:11:46.790
even if Tubman didn't believe in his more violent methods.

227
00:11:46.970 --> 00:11:49.280
Brown endearingly called our general Tubman.

228
00:11:49.281 --> 00:11:52.970
And he used her vast knowledge of the underground railroad and similar networks

229
00:11:53.230 --> 00:11:56.920
plan his own maneuvers. They also had Tubman reach out for the former slaves.

230
00:11:56.921 --> 00:12:00.670
She had helped relocate to Canada to request their help and fighting for his

231
00:12:01.150 --> 00:12:01.810
cause on may the eighth,

232
00:12:01.810 --> 00:12:05.860
1858 Brown met with Tubman's people and proceeded to unveil his plan for the

233
00:12:06.190 --> 00:12:07.023
Harper's ferry rate.

234
00:12:07.090 --> 00:12:10.300
His plans were almost immediately put on hold when the government got wind of

235
00:12:10.301 --> 00:12:12.730
them, but he still worked on them behind the scenes.

236
00:12:12.731 --> 00:12:14.350
Often with Harriet Tubman's help.

237
00:12:14.440 --> 00:12:16.300
But when it came time for the raid to take place,

238
00:12:16.840 --> 00:12:19.210
Tuttleman was unavailable for Brown to lean on for guidance.

239
00:12:19.270 --> 00:12:21.910
He forged ahead anyway, and while it was an eventual failure,

240
00:12:22.120 --> 00:12:24.910
he had already won the praise of top men and many other leaders of the

241
00:12:24.911 --> 00:12:29.140
anti-slavery cause Harriet herself said he'd done more in dying than a hundred

242
00:12:29.141 --> 00:12:31.810
men would in living in 1859.

243
00:12:32.230 --> 00:12:34.240
Harry joins with another abolitionists this time,

244
00:12:34.241 --> 00:12:36.010
Republican Senator William seaward,

245
00:12:36.011 --> 00:12:39.190
and she was able to purchase a plot of land in New York state.

246
00:12:39.310 --> 00:12:43.870
It costs a $1,200 and it's the town where it was located was perfect for Harriet

247
00:12:43.990 --> 00:12:47.950
is enabled to get family members away from these sometimes brutal Canadian

248
00:12:47.951 --> 00:12:51.490
climates. And the nearby city of Orban was very anti-slavery.

249
00:12:51.610 --> 00:12:54.940
Harriet still went down South from time to time to conduct rescue missions.

250
00:12:54.941 --> 00:12:58.240
And oftentimes you would bring them right to our New York property creating a

251
00:12:58.241 --> 00:13:00.580
safe Haven of sorts for all kinds of farmers,

252
00:13:07.410 --> 00:13:10.500
1861. So all the civil war breakouts, it was inevitable.

253
00:13:10.560 --> 00:13:13.680
The push and pull inside the country regarding slavery and its moral

254
00:13:13.681 --> 00:13:16.530
implications was bound to explode at one point or another.

255
00:13:16.770 --> 00:13:17.910
And when it boiled over,

256
00:13:18.270 --> 00:13:22.020
Harry believed in the cause of the union and its anti-slavery stance.

257
00:13:22.050 --> 00:13:22.950
She wanted to help.

258
00:13:22.951 --> 00:13:26.720
And so she joined a group of abolitionists from Boston and Philadelphia,

259
00:13:26.730 --> 00:13:29.580
as they headed down to South Carolina where the civil war began,

260
00:13:29.850 --> 00:13:33.780
she assisted in the camps that helping to Kapha escaped and recently freed

261
00:13:33.781 --> 00:13:34.500
slaves.

262
00:13:34.500 --> 00:13:38.040
She even began assembling a regimen of soldiers consisting of former slaves

263
00:13:38.041 --> 00:13:40.350
under the tutelage of general, David Hunter,

264
00:13:40.590 --> 00:13:44.190
one person who wasn't pleased with the work Harriet and general Hunter were

265
00:13:44.191 --> 00:13:46.200
doing was president Abraham Lincoln.

266
00:13:46.320 --> 00:13:49.950
He didn't think it was time yet to force the Southern States to free the slaves.

267
00:13:49.951 --> 00:13:53.460
And he actually came down pretty hard on them for their actions talking of

268
00:13:53.461 --> 00:13:54.750
course wasn't onesy mint,

269
00:13:54.751 --> 00:13:58.950
so words and she retorted back against Lincoln for what she saw as weakness.

270
00:13:59.040 --> 00:14:03.060
God, won't let master Lincoln beat the South to lead does the right thing.

271
00:14:03.150 --> 00:14:06.450
Master Lincoln. He's a great man and I am a poor Negro,

272
00:14:06.451 --> 00:14:11.070
but the Negro can tell master Lincoln how to save the money. And the young men,

273
00:14:11.130 --> 00:14:13.350
you can do it by setting the Negro free.

274
00:14:13.530 --> 00:14:15.750
That's what master Lincoln ought to know.

275
00:14:15.990 --> 00:14:19.260
It's still something that helps where she could. She worked out of port Royal,

276
00:14:19.261 --> 00:14:20.040
South Carolina,

277
00:14:20.040 --> 00:14:23.550
mostly helping scores of soldiers suffering from smallpox and dissymmetry she

278
00:14:23.790 --> 00:14:27.210
made her own pies and root beer to earn some money denying the rations that the

279
00:14:27.211 --> 00:14:29.130
government attempted to give her for a work.

280
00:14:29.190 --> 00:14:32.280
It took two years until Lincoln's emancipation proclamation was issued.

281
00:14:32.310 --> 00:14:33.780
The first step in ending slavery,

282
00:14:34.020 --> 00:14:37.740
Harriet was still working out of South Carolina and the landscape was much like

283
00:14:37.770 --> 00:14:39.030
where she grew up in Maryland.

284
00:14:39.031 --> 00:14:42.480
So she led bands of Scouts around the swamps and rivers in the area,

285
00:14:42.510 --> 00:14:45.750
gaining reconnaissance and Intel on the enemy Confederate forces.

286
00:14:45.990 --> 00:14:48.750
She works under the direct supervision of the secretary of war.

287
00:14:49.110 --> 00:14:53.300
Edward stands in and then later rated James Montgomery with information that

288
00:14:53.450 --> 00:14:55.310
helped him take the city of Jacksonville.

289
00:14:55.311 --> 00:14:58.670
Florida area was often pulling strings behind the battlefields,

290
00:14:58.700 --> 00:15:02.450
but that didn't mean she didn't take parts in some of the action as well.

291
00:15:02.480 --> 00:15:05.090
Tubman became the first woman to lead a battlefield operation.

292
00:15:05.091 --> 00:15:09.110
When general Montgomery designed it to sack a series of plantations along the

293
00:15:09.111 --> 00:15:12.980
South Carolina river Tubman advised him and helped to lead the rate.

294
00:15:13.040 --> 00:15:16.910
She guided boats of soldiers around enemy mines in the waters she watched as

295
00:15:16.911 --> 00:15:19.820
union men stormed the shore in burned down Lamentations,

296
00:15:20.000 --> 00:15:23.780
the slaves in zones that realized this was a liberation and Flint awards that

297
00:15:24.110 --> 00:15:25.010
waiting boats on the shore,

298
00:15:25.220 --> 00:15:28.910
carrying what food and possessions they could as the plantation owners trying to

299
00:15:28.911 --> 00:15:29.181
start.

300
00:15:29.181 --> 00:15:32.690
The mass Exodus Harry at beams with pride at watching helps happen there that

301
00:15:32.691 --> 00:15:36.050
day. Over 750 slaves were free. During these missions,

302
00:15:36.170 --> 00:15:39.620
Harriet was rightly ordered as a hero and many of the people she helped escape

303
00:15:39.621 --> 00:15:41.930
that captors went on to join the union army,

304
00:15:41.931 --> 00:15:44.540
to fight Harriet Tubman out the union for two more years,

305
00:15:44.541 --> 00:15:47.300
caring for wounded soldiers, scouting, enemy territory,

306
00:15:47.480 --> 00:15:49.970
and helping freed slaves adjust to their new lives.

307
00:15:50.060 --> 00:15:53.360
She did all of this while also traveling back to New York to see our family and

308
00:15:53.361 --> 00:15:56.480
those living at our sanctuary. Once the war ended in 1965,

309
00:15:56.690 --> 00:15:57.800
she went back there for good.

310
00:16:03.820 --> 00:16:04.060
<v 1>[Inaudible].</v>

311
00:16:04.060 --> 00:16:07.810
<v 0>Harriet spends her older years caring for her family and parents and taking in</v>

312
00:16:07.811 --> 00:16:10.900
boarders to help analysts with money. One of them was a man named Nelson,

313
00:16:10.901 --> 00:16:15.070
Charles Davis. She quickly took two though. It was 22 years. Her junior,

314
00:16:15.100 --> 00:16:19.120
they married in 1869 and adopted a little baby girl named Gurty five years

315
00:16:19.121 --> 00:16:21.850
later. Tubman's old abolition comrades never forgot her.

316
00:16:21.910 --> 00:16:23.560
Even as the years rolled on one,

317
00:16:23.561 --> 00:16:27.240
even Pender biography for which Harriet source and royalties from she didn't

318
00:16:27.340 --> 00:16:30.040
even receive the recognition. She deserved from a past deeds,

319
00:16:30.041 --> 00:16:31.750
which was proven time and time again,

320
00:16:32.110 --> 00:16:35.680
a bill that was proposed in Congress to pay her for her service with the union

321
00:16:35.710 --> 00:16:37.750
army was defeated in 1874.

322
00:16:37.960 --> 00:16:41.260
She was swindled out of money by conmen and assaulted during a train ride,

323
00:16:41.440 --> 00:16:43.660
even though she had government papers proving,

324
00:16:43.661 --> 00:16:46.300
she could sit in the section she was in, she still fought.

325
00:16:46.390 --> 00:16:50.010
She traveled up and down the East coast in the 1890s to fight for women's rights

326
00:16:50.011 --> 00:16:53.770
to vote. She also turns more to water spiritual side. In 1983,

327
00:16:53.771 --> 00:16:58.210
she donated a sizeable piece of land as to the African Methodist Episcopal Zion

328
00:16:58.211 --> 00:16:58.690
church.

329
00:16:58.690 --> 00:17:02.980
With the stipulation that it would be a home for aged and indignant colored

330
00:17:02.981 --> 00:17:06.040
people, frustrations mounted, as it took years to complete the facility.
