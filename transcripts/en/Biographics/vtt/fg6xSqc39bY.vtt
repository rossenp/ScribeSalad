00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.640
<v 0>Just before we get started with today's video,</v>

2
00:00:01.641 --> 00:00:04.880
do you wanna give a quick plug to my new podcast, the casual criminalist,

3
00:00:05.060 --> 00:00:06.760
we cover a lot of crimes, criminals,

4
00:00:06.820 --> 00:00:10.720
bad things on this channel because apparently you guys just love the darkest

5
00:00:10.730 --> 00:00:11.563
stuff. Well,

6
00:00:11.620 --> 00:00:15.240
eat your black heart out because I now have a long form about an hour long,

7
00:00:15.241 --> 00:00:18.280
weekly podcast covering some of the darkest things that I could find from the UK

8
00:00:18.281 --> 00:00:22.030
doctor who was the worst serial killer in history to the time in American

9
00:00:22.031 --> 00:00:25.870
socialite, murdered her best friend with her car, allegedly,

10
00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:28.150
and totally got away with it and much more,

11
00:00:28.151 --> 00:00:33.110
but is also laid back more freeform with the occasional laugh because isn't

12
00:00:33.111 --> 00:00:35.670
death hilarious. So let's jump into it today,

13
00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:43.140
Jack, the ripper, the Sodi act.

14
00:00:43.141 --> 00:00:48.020
These are names that still evoke fear and dread in the hearts of many people

15
00:00:48.330 --> 00:00:51.380
decades, even centuries after they were first mentioned,

16
00:00:51.450 --> 00:00:54.780
this is due to a simple reason. They would've a court or identified.

17
00:00:54.781 --> 00:00:57.540
These men were able to carry out gruesome killing sprees,

18
00:00:57.541 --> 00:01:01.260
fulfilling their darkest desires, and then get away with it for decades.

19
00:01:01.660 --> 00:01:06.250
There was another chilling name on that list. B T K short for binds,

20
00:01:06.251 --> 00:01:10.290
torture kill a murder maniac. He began terrorizing Wichita, Kansas.

21
00:01:10.291 --> 00:01:14.210
During the 1970s, he aided capture during the original investigation.

22
00:01:14.350 --> 00:01:16.250
During the eighties and early nineties,

23
00:01:16.310 --> 00:01:19.890
he had become such a ghost that he killed three more people without the police,

24
00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:23.280
even realizing that it was him doing it afterwards,

25
00:01:23.500 --> 00:01:24.720
he completely went underground,

26
00:01:24.721 --> 00:01:28.960
stopped all communication and raised all hope that he might one day be

27
00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:29.910
identified.

28
00:01:29.910 --> 00:01:32.280
<v 1>Well, almost all hope in the end,</v>

29
00:01:32.480 --> 00:01:35.360
his craving for attention made him reach out again. One mistake later,

30
00:01:35.580 --> 00:01:37.400
and he was identified and arrested.

31
00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:40.640
It might have happened 30 years after his killing spree started,

32
00:01:40.780 --> 00:01:44.470
but BTK finally had a real name. Dennis Rader.

33
00:01:51.350 --> 00:01:54.310
<v 0>Dennis Lynn Rader was born on March the ninth, nineteen forty five,</v>

34
00:01:54.310 --> 00:01:58.070
one of four sons to William and Dorothea Rader. He was born in Pittsburgh,

35
00:01:58.071 --> 00:01:58.730
Kansas,

36
00:01:58.730 --> 00:02:03.260
but raised in Wichita the same place where he would carry out his spree of era

37
00:02:03.261 --> 00:02:06.220
decades later. Rita attended Wichita Heights,

38
00:02:06.221 --> 00:02:09.780
high school and later enrolled at Wichita state university in 1964.

39
00:02:09.781 --> 00:02:10.940
College wasn't for him though.

40
00:02:10.941 --> 00:02:14.220
So he dropped out and joined the United States air force when he was 21 and

41
00:02:14.221 --> 00:02:15.820
spent the next four years as a mechanic.

42
00:02:15.850 --> 00:02:19.500
When he returns back to Kansas R wanted to complete his college education,

43
00:02:19.520 --> 00:02:23.380
but it proved problematic for him as he switched between multiple institutions.

44
00:02:23.590 --> 00:02:27.850
He finally obtained a degree in administration of justice in 1979. Meanwhile,

45
00:02:27.950 --> 00:02:30.490
he supported himself with various jobs in park city,

46
00:02:30.491 --> 00:02:32.250
Kansas at suburb of Wichita,

47
00:02:32.251 --> 00:02:34.450
including as an assembler for a camping gear company,

48
00:02:34.690 --> 00:02:38.450
a grocery store employee and an installation manager for a home security company

49
00:02:38.451 --> 00:02:40.210
called ADT security services.

50
00:02:40.360 --> 00:02:44.280
That third one occurred while BTK was active and was in act.

51
00:02:44.281 --> 00:02:47.840
One of the main reasons why so many people were getting home security systems in

52
00:02:47.841 --> 00:02:49.240
the first place let's old. It,

53
00:02:49.241 --> 00:02:52.240
any of them know that the person they were allowing into their homes to make

54
00:02:52.241 --> 00:02:56.760
themselves feel safer was the same person they wanted to be protected from in

55
00:02:56.920 --> 00:02:57.481
1971,

56
00:02:57.481 --> 00:03:01.920
Dennis RA married a woman called Paula jets and their two children together,

57
00:03:02.400 --> 00:03:03.760
Carrie and Brian on the outside.

58
00:03:03.761 --> 00:03:06.680
It seemed very much like your typical humdrum family life.

59
00:03:06.681 --> 00:03:10.280
<v 1>And it would be decades until people discovered that there was actually</v>

60
00:03:10.281 --> 00:03:13.360
something much darker hiding beneath the surface.

61
00:03:13.700 --> 00:03:16.960
As we later found out after BTK was finally apprehended,

62
00:03:17.020 --> 00:03:20.950
Dennis Rader did not have the type of traumatic childhood that we often

63
00:03:20.951 --> 00:03:22.510
associate with serial killers.

64
00:03:22.511 --> 00:03:24.990
He felt ignored by his parents because they worked long hours,

65
00:03:25.130 --> 00:03:29.230
but that was about it even so sadistic urges began developing in Denis from an

66
00:03:29.231 --> 00:03:32.110
early age, his sexual fantasies revolved around pain and.

67
00:03:32.530 --> 00:03:35.390
<v 0>He started by cutting out female forms from magazines, drawing,</v>

68
00:03:35.660 --> 00:03:38.790
gags and ropes around them and gluing them onto three by five index,

69
00:03:39.460 --> 00:03:41.020
which carried around with him. As a teenager,

70
00:03:41.580 --> 00:03:44.260
RA took up peeing into windows and stealing women's underwear.

71
00:03:44.320 --> 00:03:48.540
He began getting sexually excited by seeing animals being tortured and killed.

72
00:03:48.640 --> 00:03:51.220
He started off by watching chickens being sent to the slaughter,

73
00:03:51.480 --> 00:03:55.420
but then advanced doing the killing himself, hanging a cat and a dog.

74
00:03:55.640 --> 00:03:59.260
He enjoyed being spanked and tied up a bit lighted even more to see the same

75
00:03:59.530 --> 00:04:02.090
done to women whenever he was aroused by such an act,

76
00:04:02.091 --> 00:04:03.650
he called it Sparky big time.

77
00:04:03.710 --> 00:04:07.050
And the point of climax was called the big G in fact,

78
00:04:07.530 --> 00:04:10.810
Rader had a whole vocabulary or Kodak as he preferred it,

79
00:04:10.811 --> 00:04:12.850
which he used in order to refer to his crimes.

80
00:04:12.990 --> 00:04:15.610
He borrowed a lot of terms from true crime magazines.

81
00:04:15.610 --> 00:04:17.010
From the 1950s and sixties,

82
00:04:17.011 --> 00:04:20.280
he called his victims project while a killing was a hit.

83
00:04:20.500 --> 00:04:23.680
He referred to the murderous persona that lived inside him full of violent

84
00:04:23.700 --> 00:04:28.280
sexual impulses as the minute or when it was time to switch from his normal

85
00:04:28.960 --> 00:04:33.400
everyday family guy, facade to the Menor. He called it going dark. And lastly,

86
00:04:33.401 --> 00:04:36.960
he described the force that drove him to kill some kind of mysterious element

87
00:04:37.180 --> 00:04:38.280
dubbed factor X.

88
00:04:38.370 --> 00:04:41.750
There are two likely reasons why he came up with all of these terms.

89
00:04:41.751 --> 00:04:42.870
According to psychologists,

90
00:04:43.130 --> 00:04:46.550
the first would be to help distance himself from the reality of what he was

91
00:04:46.551 --> 00:04:49.150
doing in his mind. He wasn't murdering a person. Nope.

92
00:04:49.250 --> 00:04:53.110
He was going dark to work on a project and it couldn't be his fault.

93
00:04:53.130 --> 00:04:56.830
If he was driven to do it by some magical factor acts.

94
00:04:56.970 --> 00:04:59.590
The second reason was to simply make himself feel more special.

95
00:05:00.030 --> 00:05:03.820
RA had the NASA cystic personality you'd expect from a killer like him.

96
00:05:03.880 --> 00:05:07.660
And it exhibited in typical fashion, giving himself a name in the media,

97
00:05:07.980 --> 00:05:11.860
taunting the police and trying to create some kind of mysterious impenetrable

98
00:05:11.890 --> 00:05:14.300
persona that made him unique among killers.

99
00:05:14.520 --> 00:05:17.620
The irony here is that by doing these things to make himself feel special,

100
00:05:17.840 --> 00:05:22.450
he was displaying the standard behavior of an eager man called psychopath.

101
00:05:28.800 --> 00:05:30.570
With time radio came Boulder and Boulder.

102
00:05:30.640 --> 00:05:34.050
When it came to living out his S and M dreams, when he was with the air force,

103
00:05:34.070 --> 00:05:38.250
he drew his fantasies on pieces of paper that he burned. When he left bass,

104
00:05:38.470 --> 00:05:40.530
he claimed that he visited prostitutes,

105
00:05:40.550 --> 00:05:44.720
but most of them were too IIM by him and refused to play out his ideas.

106
00:05:44.721 --> 00:05:47.360
Sometimes he broke into homes and stole women's underwear,

107
00:05:47.361 --> 00:05:48.680
which he added to his collection.

108
00:05:48.750 --> 00:05:51.640
This was a habit which continued through his entire spree.

109
00:05:52.160 --> 00:05:55.240
Radar took many keepsakes from his victims and for quick access,

110
00:05:55.260 --> 00:05:58.920
he placed them in various spots around Wichita, which called Heidi holes.

111
00:05:59.340 --> 00:06:00.020
Of course,

112
00:06:00.020 --> 00:06:04.040
as the years went on drawings and voyeurism became insufficient to satisfy

113
00:06:04.800 --> 00:06:05.121
Raiders urges.

114
00:06:05.121 --> 00:06:08.640
It was only a matter of time until he finally progressed to what he truly

115
00:06:08.641 --> 00:06:12.520
wanted. Murder RA carried out his first attack on January the 15th,

116
00:06:12.920 --> 00:06:16.160
1974. And he started out big as he targeted an,

117
00:06:16.590 --> 00:06:17.950
a family husband and wife,

118
00:06:17.970 --> 00:06:22.230
Joseph and Julie Aero alongside two of their children. Nine year old,

119
00:06:22.231 --> 00:06:24.430
Joseph junior Rens, 11 year old Josephine.

120
00:06:24.570 --> 00:06:27.550
He did it in the morning as well while the children were getting ready for

121
00:06:27.551 --> 00:06:31.030
school. And the family also had a dog which could have alerted the neighbors.

122
00:06:31.170 --> 00:06:33.430
In other words, this was a high risk crime.

123
00:06:33.450 --> 00:06:36.830
So Ray got pretty lucky that he wasn't caught right at the outset.

124
00:06:37.020 --> 00:06:38.260
According to the killer himself,

125
00:06:38.280 --> 00:06:42.140
he snuck inside the otros detached garage and waited for his opportunity.

126
00:06:42.250 --> 00:06:46.140
Then a little after 8:30 AM, Joseph ju exited the house to go to school.

127
00:06:46.141 --> 00:06:49.180
That is when Rader bombed with a knife into 22 caliber pistol,

128
00:06:49.400 --> 00:06:53.300
forced him back inside and confronted the entire family in order to keep them at

129
00:06:53.301 --> 00:06:53.461
ease.

130
00:06:53.461 --> 00:06:56.860
He told the at terrors that this was a robbery and that they would not be harmed

131
00:06:56.861 --> 00:06:59.370
if they did what he set the family complied. First,

132
00:06:59.371 --> 00:07:02.690
the father put the dog outside and afterwards they allowed themselves to be

133
00:07:02.691 --> 00:07:05.930
taken into the bedroom and tied up. At this point, it was too late for them.

134
00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:09.170
They were completely at Ray's mercy, which did not exist.

135
00:07:09.390 --> 00:07:11.930
He had been fantasizing about this moment for decades.

136
00:07:12.230 --> 00:07:16.370
He killed the Aeros by strangulation and suffocation using either a length of

137
00:07:16.610 --> 00:07:17.730
Rob or plastic bags.

138
00:07:18.040 --> 00:07:21.760
Sometimes he would allow them to catch their breath and regain consciousness

139
00:07:21.761 --> 00:07:24.000
before dying, just so he could strangle them again.

140
00:07:24.070 --> 00:07:25.960
None of the victims were sexually assaulted.

141
00:07:26.120 --> 00:07:29.200
Although the murderers semen was found at the scene and it later proved

142
00:07:29.201 --> 00:07:31.160
instrumental in getting ready to convicted.

143
00:07:31.260 --> 00:07:34.240
And if you want to make the crimes just a bit more horrifying,

144
00:07:34.241 --> 00:07:36.800
the bodies were found by one of the other ERO children,

145
00:07:36.990 --> 00:07:39.510
15 year old Charlie at terror at the scene,

146
00:07:39.511 --> 00:07:41.270
Wichita police was stunned into shock.

147
00:07:41.370 --> 00:07:44.150
Not only were these the most gruesome murders they had ever seen,

148
00:07:44.330 --> 00:07:47.270
but they happened in broad daylight, in a choir neighborhood.

149
00:07:47.380 --> 00:07:49.990
Plus the killer clearly planned the whole thing in advance.

150
00:07:49.991 --> 00:07:53.750
As he was careful to bring along tapes, hoods wire, cutters, cords,

151
00:07:53.751 --> 00:07:57.870
and most likely a gun, everything he needed in order to subdue the whole family.

152
00:07:57.960 --> 00:08:02.460
There were no signs of forced entry or a struggle and no evidence of a robbery.

153
00:08:02.630 --> 00:08:05.820
Apart from Joseph Tara's watch, which was missing after he was done,

154
00:08:06.040 --> 00:08:08.260
the killer even left in the Atter car.

155
00:08:08.360 --> 00:08:12.060
The circumstances surrounding the crimes didn't immediately scream Syria or

156
00:08:12.061 --> 00:08:12.320
killer.

157
00:08:12.320 --> 00:08:15.780
So the police investigated the possibility that the at terror might have been

158
00:08:15.781 --> 00:08:18.460
marked for execution by a criminal organization. However,

159
00:08:18.461 --> 00:08:19.930
looking into their back rounds,

160
00:08:19.931 --> 00:08:22.770
they could find nothing to suggest a possible motive for such a thing.

161
00:08:22.880 --> 00:08:24.810
Plus there was still the semen traces on the floor,

162
00:08:24.811 --> 00:08:27.490
which definitely did not indicate a professional hit.

163
00:08:27.500 --> 00:08:29.170
Ultimately when talking to the press,

164
00:08:29.171 --> 00:08:33.210
the Wichita police chief Floyd Hanlin said that the crimes had been perpetrated

165
00:08:33.430 --> 00:08:34.730
by a killer with a fetish

166
00:08:40.910 --> 00:08:42.960
Just three months later, the killer struck again,

167
00:08:42.961 --> 00:08:46.280
this time targeting 21 year olds, Catherine Bryce on April the fourth,

168
00:08:47.000 --> 00:08:50.520
1974 radar broke into B Bright's home when she wasn't there and waited for her

169
00:08:50.521 --> 00:08:53.520
return. When the young woman came back accompanied by her younger brother,

170
00:08:53.530 --> 00:08:56.360
Kevin, they were greeted by a man with a gun. Again,

171
00:08:57.160 --> 00:08:59.480
Rader played the role of a robber, reassuring his victims,

172
00:08:59.590 --> 00:09:02.120
that as long as they gave him the money and the car keys,

173
00:09:02.260 --> 00:09:03.920
he would not harm them. A gunpoint.

174
00:09:03.921 --> 00:09:07.040
Kevin tied his sister to a chair and then went into the bedroom with the

175
00:09:07.041 --> 00:09:09.120
intruder where he was also tied in gags. However,

176
00:09:09.230 --> 00:09:12.640
once radar slipped and knotted stalking around his neck and began strangling

177
00:09:12.641 --> 00:09:16.710
him, that is when Kevin realized the angry he was in and he started fight back.

178
00:09:16.850 --> 00:09:20.270
The scuffle was brief because Ray pulled out a gun from his waistband and shot

179
00:09:20.271 --> 00:09:23.510
Kevin Bright. He left the room for a moment, then returned and shot him again.

180
00:09:23.610 --> 00:09:25.550
He didn't bother to check if his victim was dead,

181
00:09:25.990 --> 00:09:28.950
probably because his mind was on his real target. Catherine Bright.

182
00:09:29.050 --> 00:09:31.430
As a matter of fact, Kevin was still breathing in a Daisy,

183
00:09:31.580 --> 00:09:35.700
managed to get out of the house and stumble into passing bystand who took him to

184
00:09:35.701 --> 00:09:38.220
the hospital and called the police. When the authorities arrived,

185
00:09:38.250 --> 00:09:41.380
they found Catherine Bright with multiple injuries, but still alive.

186
00:09:41.600 --> 00:09:44.700
She had been stabbed three times in the abdomen and also had ligature marks

187
00:09:44.701 --> 00:09:47.620
around her throat from being strangled. She was rushed to the hospital,

188
00:09:48.080 --> 00:09:50.060
but she died a few hours later at the time,

189
00:09:50.061 --> 00:09:53.380
the police did not associate Catherine Bright's murder with the deaths of the

190
00:09:53.700 --> 00:09:56.970
Atari family raid. Didn't wear a mask when he attacked the brother and sister.

191
00:09:57.110 --> 00:10:00.290
So they were able to get a description of the killer from Kevin Bright,

192
00:10:00.430 --> 00:10:04.530
but this did not lead anywhere. Afterwards. The murders stopped for a few years,

193
00:10:04.740 --> 00:10:07.650
right off the bat Raiders killings were away for him to get attention.

194
00:10:07.760 --> 00:10:09.850
When his crimes weren't making headlines anymore,

195
00:10:10.290 --> 00:10:13.490
he would rekindle public interest in them by writing to the media or the police.

196
00:10:13.790 --> 00:10:17.520
His first attempt to communication happened in 19 74,

197
00:10:17.520 --> 00:10:19.080
9 months after he killed the at terrors,

198
00:10:19.320 --> 00:10:23.200
Ray contacted the Wichita Eagle anonymously and told them to look inside a

199
00:10:23.201 --> 00:10:25.360
certain book at the local public library there,

200
00:10:25.361 --> 00:10:29.120
they found a letter whose author was claiming credit for the Atero murders while

201
00:10:29.121 --> 00:10:32.760
also dismissing the other police suspects as nothing but people wanting

202
00:10:32.761 --> 00:10:36.480
publicity for his actions. The letter contained details about the killings, the,

203
00:10:36.750 --> 00:10:40.190
it had not been made public. So the authenticity was beyond doubt,

204
00:10:40.250 --> 00:10:44.390
but police asked the newspaper not to publish it in order to prevent more false

205
00:10:44.391 --> 00:10:46.350
confessions, the complied,

206
00:10:46.370 --> 00:10:49.830
but the competing witch at our son also got their hands on a copy and they

207
00:10:49.831 --> 00:10:51.510
published parts of the letter in December.

208
00:10:51.660 --> 00:10:55.390
Here are a few person quotes that illustrate the killers mentality.

209
00:10:55.790 --> 00:10:58.700
I write this letter to you for the sake of the taxpayer, as well as your time.

210
00:10:58.710 --> 00:11:03.060
Those three dude you have in custody are just talking to get publicity for the

211
00:11:03.300 --> 00:11:04.780
terror murders. They know nothing at all.

212
00:11:05.020 --> 00:11:09.020
I did it by myself and with no one's help. I'm sorry. This happened to society.

213
00:11:09.021 --> 00:11:11.940
They're the ones who suffer the most. It hard to control myself.

214
00:11:12.050 --> 00:11:16.060
When this monster ends my brain, I will never know, but it here to stay.

215
00:11:16.160 --> 00:11:17.810
How does one cure himself off?

216
00:11:17.910 --> 00:11:20.250
If you ask for help that you have killed for people,

217
00:11:20.320 --> 00:11:24.290
they will laugh or hit the panic button and call the cops. I can't stop it.

218
00:11:24.350 --> 00:11:27.970
So the monster goes on and hunts me as well as society.

219
00:11:28.200 --> 00:11:32.050
Society can be thankful that there are ways for people like me to relieve myself

220
00:11:32.110 --> 00:11:35.970
at time, by daydream of some victims, being torture and being mine.

221
00:11:36.020 --> 00:11:40.520
Maybe you can stop him. I can't, he's already chosen his next victim or victims.

222
00:11:40.960 --> 00:11:45.080
I don't know who they are yet. The next day after I read the paper, I will know,

223
00:11:45.640 --> 00:11:49.080
but it too late. Good luck hunting yours truly guilty.

224
00:11:49.250 --> 00:11:50.960
There was also the post script,

225
00:11:50.961 --> 00:11:53.280
which was notable for mentioning for the first time,

226
00:11:53.420 --> 00:11:56.320
the Monik by which this killer would be remembered. PS,

227
00:11:56.370 --> 00:12:00.280
since sex criminals do not change their Mo or by nature cannot do so.

228
00:12:00.440 --> 00:12:04.720
I will not change mine. The code word for me will be bind them, torture them,

229
00:12:04.990 --> 00:12:08.640
kill them. B T K. You see he added again.

230
00:12:08.870 --> 00:12:13.310
They will be on the next victim. So now the serial killer had a name B T K.

231
00:12:13.530 --> 00:12:16.470
Now he might have noticed that the letter was rife with spelling and grammatical

232
00:12:16.471 --> 00:12:17.870
errors. I certainly did reading it,

233
00:12:17.871 --> 00:12:20.230
but the mistakes were seemingly done at random.

234
00:12:20.770 --> 00:12:23.350
BTK appeared to struggle with simple mundane words,

235
00:12:23.370 --> 00:12:24.830
but he had no problem spelling,

236
00:12:24.831 --> 00:12:28.950
psychotic or perversion investigators realized early on that this was probably

237
00:12:28.951 --> 00:12:32.510
an attempt by the criminal to make himself look more undereducated than he

238
00:12:32.750 --> 00:12:34.940
actually was. And based on the content of the letter,

239
00:12:34.970 --> 00:12:38.860
they also believed he studied criminal psychology. At one point curiously,

240
00:12:38.861 --> 00:12:41.940
even though BTK clearly wanted to get credit for the crimes he committed.

241
00:12:41.950 --> 00:12:44.540
There was no mention of Catherine Bright in the letter.

242
00:12:45.060 --> 00:12:47.980
Another reason why police didn't connect the murder until later

243
00:12:54.750 --> 00:12:56.530
BTK went quiet after 1974,

244
00:12:56.590 --> 00:13:00.010
it seems like the five murders plus the letter were enough to satiate his

245
00:13:00.011 --> 00:13:02.050
attention craving for a while.

246
00:13:02.110 --> 00:13:06.290
At least he didn't strike again until 1977 on March the 17th,

247
00:13:06.530 --> 00:13:08.930
he attacked 26 year old Shirley Vienna in her home.

248
00:13:09.150 --> 00:13:10.490
She was there with her three children.

249
00:13:10.710 --> 00:13:13.490
So she cooperated after he promised to leave them alone.

250
00:13:13.491 --> 00:13:17.040
This time he actually kept his promise. BTK locked the children in the closet,

251
00:13:17.260 --> 00:13:21.360
but did not harm them. Well, sort of in an interview decades later,

252
00:13:21.640 --> 00:13:23.440
RA admitted that he intended to kill them as well,

253
00:13:23.540 --> 00:13:25.560
but had to leave the scene before doing so.

254
00:13:25.960 --> 00:13:28.400
Shirley Yann on the other hand felt the full force of his rage.

255
00:13:28.580 --> 00:13:31.480
Police found her on the beds with her hands and feet bounds.

256
00:13:31.481 --> 00:13:35.350
Having been suffocated with a plastic bag over a head and strangles with the

257
00:13:35.550 --> 00:13:36.590
cord tied around her neck.

258
00:13:36.660 --> 00:13:40.470
This time police suspected that this was the work of BTK from the start.

259
00:13:40.530 --> 00:13:43.030
The crime scene was very similar to that at the, at terrors,

260
00:13:43.050 --> 00:13:46.350
it happened in broad daylight. It had clearly been premeditated.

261
00:13:46.530 --> 00:13:50.230
The killing method was the same. The phone lines were cut. And as the culprits,

262
00:13:50.231 --> 00:13:51.510
even news the same signature,

263
00:13:51.790 --> 00:13:54.790
not for the cord and important detail that was kept out to the newspapers.

264
00:13:55.560 --> 00:13:57.220
BTK killed again. The same year,

265
00:13:57.221 --> 00:14:01.060
25 year old Nancy Fox was found in our home strangled with our own nylon

266
00:14:01.061 --> 00:14:04.700
stockings on December the eighth. This time though, BTK did something different.

267
00:14:04.800 --> 00:14:08.140
He called in his own murder to the police. We're not really sure why,

268
00:14:08.200 --> 00:14:11.660
but this crime was carried out at night and the killer had to break a window to

269
00:14:11.661 --> 00:14:14.340
get in into the house. Since it differed from the other crime scenes,

270
00:14:14.980 --> 00:14:17.890
Rader may have simp wanted to make sure that he got the credit for it.

271
00:14:17.990 --> 00:14:20.970
His obsession with recognition was made pretty evident. The following year,

272
00:14:20.971 --> 00:14:23.650
when BTK resumed his letter writing campaign to the media,

273
00:14:23.870 --> 00:14:27.730
it started with a document sent to a local TV station in January, 1978.

274
00:14:27.830 --> 00:14:31.090
His message was now clear, concise, and error free.

275
00:14:31.310 --> 00:14:35.570
How many do I have to kill before I get my name in the paper or some national

276
00:14:35.970 --> 00:14:36.420
attention?

277
00:14:36.420 --> 00:14:39.840
The next month he sent another letter this time to the Wichita Eagle beacon.

278
00:14:40.240 --> 00:14:43.280
It contained poem. He titled O death to Nancy.

279
00:14:43.660 --> 00:14:47.440
He also first made mention of the mysterious fact to X, which drove him to kill.

280
00:14:47.460 --> 00:14:50.360
But most importantly, he claimed to have murdered seven people,

281
00:14:50.620 --> 00:14:53.600
not six taking credit for the death of Catherine Bright,

282
00:14:53.880 --> 00:14:57.320
although he did not name her BTK laid dormant for the next eight years,

283
00:14:57.350 --> 00:15:00.480
barring one extremely close call for a woman named Anna Williams,

284
00:15:00.481 --> 00:15:04.080
who probably had to counter herself the luckiest person in Wichita,

285
00:15:04.081 --> 00:15:07.880
unbeknownst to her BD Ked selected her as his next target on the 28th of April,

286
00:15:08.120 --> 00:15:11.950
1979. He broke into her home and wait for Williams to arrive. However,

287
00:15:12.170 --> 00:15:15.710
she was held up and came home much later than BTK anticipated,

288
00:15:15.711 --> 00:15:18.670
frustrated and tired of waiting. He left before her return,

289
00:15:18.690 --> 00:15:21.230
but made sure to let her know about what had happened.

290
00:15:21.710 --> 00:15:25.150
RA took one of her scarves and later sent it back along with a note, which said,

291
00:15:25.250 --> 00:15:27.630
be glad you weren't here because I was

292
00:15:34.240 --> 00:15:37.340
The BTK case. Went quiet during the first half of the 1980s.

293
00:15:37.440 --> 00:15:40.660
For whatever reason, Ray, not only temper's murderous impulses,

294
00:15:40.800 --> 00:15:44.380
but also stopped writing letters in 1979 on the investigative side,

295
00:15:44.381 --> 00:15:48.300
police formed a task force that assembled a list with hundreds of suspects and

296
00:15:48.301 --> 00:15:52.250
slowly whitled it down until there was nobody left after about years with no

297
00:15:52.251 --> 00:15:54.970
success, the task force was disbanded with no new leads.

298
00:15:55.120 --> 00:15:59.170
More and more investigators were being moved to other assignments while BTK was

299
00:15:59.171 --> 00:16:00.370
quickly becoming a cold case.

300
00:16:00.850 --> 00:16:04.730
Many started to believe that BTK was gone from Wichita one way or another.

301
00:16:04.840 --> 00:16:07.450
Even his profile said that as a compulsive psychopath,

302
00:16:07.451 --> 00:16:11.170
he would never willingly give up killing and that it was likely that he was

303
00:16:11.171 --> 00:16:13.160
either dead disabled or in prison.

304
00:16:13.230 --> 00:16:16.680
None of those were true as it turned out what the police were searching for in

305
00:16:17.040 --> 00:16:20.960
Rado was still right there along with him serving his community as a Cub scout

306
00:16:20.961 --> 00:16:22.160
leader, a compliance officer,

307
00:16:22.300 --> 00:16:26.000
and even as a council member of the Christ Lutheran church EST,

308
00:16:26.001 --> 00:16:26.521
strangely enough,

309
00:16:26.521 --> 00:16:29.840
the one piece of communication he had with the police during the 1980s was to

310
00:16:30.040 --> 00:16:34.110
actually deny his involvement in the triple murder of the AGA family in 1987.

311
00:16:34.470 --> 00:16:37.670
Although he did express admiration for the true killer, if nothing else,

312
00:16:37.671 --> 00:16:41.350
this showed the authorities that BTK was not dead or in prison,

313
00:16:41.650 --> 00:16:45.270
as it turned out, radar was not quite as inactive as authorities thought he was,

314
00:16:45.370 --> 00:16:46.510
he killed three more women,

315
00:16:46.610 --> 00:16:49.870
but the murders were sufficiently different from his usual Mo the police never

316
00:16:49.871 --> 00:16:53.820
connected them to BDK. First was 53 year old Marine hedge and 1985.

317
00:16:53.821 --> 00:16:56.620
One of RA's neighbors. This was his most daring crime.

318
00:16:56.621 --> 00:16:59.900
He thought because he knew it was very risky to target someone in his immediate

319
00:17:00.010 --> 00:17:00.490
area.

320
00:17:00.490 --> 00:17:03.900
This is probably why he never claimed credit for the murder until after he was

321
00:17:03.901 --> 00:17:05.300
caught. After he strangled him,

322
00:17:05.580 --> 00:17:09.820
RA took her to his church where he posed her in positions and took photographs

323
00:17:09.821 --> 00:17:12.900
afterwards. He dumped her body in a ditch along a remote, uh, road.

324
00:17:13.040 --> 00:17:16.170
It was the photo time that BT gay made an effort not to have his crime

325
00:17:16.450 --> 00:17:19.290
discovered. And it occurred eight years after the last murder.

326
00:17:19.390 --> 00:17:23.090
So it wasn't surprising that Richard tar police didn't immediately assume the

327
00:17:23.091 --> 00:17:26.650
crime was connected to its infamous serial killer. His next target, however,

328
00:17:26.830 --> 00:17:30.570
was far more in line with Raider's usual approach on September the 16th,

329
00:17:30.970 --> 00:17:35.800
19 86, 28 year old Vicki Waal was found in our strangled with a pair of nylon

330
00:17:35.801 --> 00:17:38.920
stockings, why she was not considered a possible BTK victim.

331
00:17:39.180 --> 00:17:43.000
We don't know probably because this was before the FA ladder from 1987.

332
00:17:43.020 --> 00:17:46.840
So authorities were still under the assumption that BTK was gone afterwards,

333
00:17:46.841 --> 00:17:49.080
came another long rest period for the killer Brady,

334
00:17:49.760 --> 00:17:52.160
his 10th and final victim in January, 1991.

335
00:17:52.161 --> 00:17:56.440
When he killed 62 year old Dolores Davis, as with Maureen head,

336
00:17:56.720 --> 00:18:00.080
she tried to conceal his crime by taking her body and dumping it under a bridge.

337
00:18:00.350 --> 00:18:03.320
Even though she was eventually discovered bound and strangled,

338
00:18:03.321 --> 00:18:07.640
Dolores Davis was also not considered a BTK victim following his last murder.

339
00:18:08.160 --> 00:18:11.990
Rader went to a very long period of an activity and the world didn't hear from

340
00:18:12.330 --> 00:18:14.310
BTK. Again for 14 years

341
00:18:20.440 --> 00:18:25.070
Throughout the 1990s, the killer remained silent and the BTK case went cold.

342
00:18:25.170 --> 00:18:27.470
His identity probably could have remained a mystery forever.

343
00:18:27.490 --> 00:18:30.940
If Raiders craving for attention, didn't suddenly come back with a vengeance.

344
00:18:31.340 --> 00:18:34.460
Most believed that he was angered by an article published 30 years after the

345
00:18:34.740 --> 00:18:35.221
Atari murders,

346
00:18:35.221 --> 00:18:39.620
which said that Kansas students no longer remembered the name BTK in March,

347
00:18:39.620 --> 00:18:41.380
2004. He sent a new letter to the Wichita Eagle.

348
00:18:41.620 --> 00:18:45.660
This time claiming credit for the murder of Vicki Geral from 1986, as proof,

349
00:18:45.661 --> 00:18:49.060
he included a copy of her driver's license in several photographs of her body,

350
00:18:49.070 --> 00:18:50.890
which he had capped all these decades.

351
00:18:51.140 --> 00:18:55.210
There was no doubt in the investigator's minds that the letter was genuine and

352
00:18:55.211 --> 00:18:57.690
the case got hot. Once more, fortunately, for them,

353
00:18:57.691 --> 00:19:00.490
there was no shortage of communication from the killer.

354
00:19:00.491 --> 00:19:03.730
This time around clearly Rader felt that he had been quiet long enough.

355
00:19:03.730 --> 00:19:05.530
So he sent 11 messages in one year.

356
00:19:05.670 --> 00:19:09.890
The police's main concern was that this renewed zeal could mean that BTK was

357
00:19:10.040 --> 00:19:11.200
getting ready to kill. Again.

358
00:19:11.640 --> 00:19:14.480
Ray provided a lot of clues about his life and the messages he sent.

359
00:19:14.481 --> 00:19:18.400
He claimed to have been born in 1939. He said his dad died in world war II,

360
00:19:18.500 --> 00:19:20.240
and that he also served in the military.

361
00:19:20.260 --> 00:19:23.920
He said that he used to repair copiers and that he once operated a ham radio.

362
00:19:24.150 --> 00:19:26.800
Most of the claims were false, but their goal was to talk.

363
00:19:26.820 --> 00:19:29.360
The authorities showing them that even with his help,

364
00:19:29.510 --> 00:19:31.390
they still couldn't at BTK.

365
00:19:31.400 --> 00:19:35.630
Eventually the killer got to Cockan made a big mistake that led to his capture.

366
00:19:35.890 --> 00:19:38.870
In one letter, he asked the police if a floppy disc could be traced,

367
00:19:39.070 --> 00:19:42.870
not they said no, because of course they did who in their right mind,

368
00:19:42.871 --> 00:19:46.190
would've expected them to tell the truth in this situation for whatever reason,

369
00:19:46.870 --> 00:19:48.790
Ray trusted them. So with his next communicate,

370
00:19:49.110 --> 00:19:50.950
he included a floppy disc on the disc.

371
00:19:51.060 --> 00:19:53.300
Police were able to recover a deleted word file,

372
00:19:53.301 --> 00:19:57.140
which still had metadata on it that directed them to the Christ Lutheran church

373
00:19:57.160 --> 00:20:00.660
and pointed the finger at Dennis Rader. After 30 long years,

374
00:20:00.661 --> 00:20:04.820
investigators knew the name of BTK, but they needed more solid evidence.

375
00:20:04.821 --> 00:20:05.740
Fortunately for them,

376
00:20:05.760 --> 00:20:08.260
the killer had left his DNA at several of the crime scenes.

377
00:20:08.410 --> 00:20:12.730
They obtained a subpoena for the medical records of Kerry raw RA's daughter and

378
00:20:12.970 --> 00:20:16.050
compared a routine pap smear from her with the killer's DNA.

379
00:20:16.270 --> 00:20:19.570
It was a familial match. Carrie's father was BTK.

380
00:20:19.630 --> 00:20:23.290
Dennis Rader was finally arrested on February the 21st, 2005.

381
00:20:23.291 --> 00:20:24.690
According to lead investigator,

382
00:20:24.790 --> 00:20:28.890
Ken land radar was shocked that the police lied to him about the dis especially

383
00:20:29.040 --> 00:20:31.930
land wear, whom the killer called by his first name and thought the,

384
00:20:32.240 --> 00:20:35.120
who had a close report together. He later said in an interview, the,

385
00:20:35.140 --> 00:20:38.440
the floppy did me in, after he got over his feelings of betrayal,

386
00:20:38.460 --> 00:20:41.560
the investigation and subsequent trial went relatively smoothly.

387
00:20:41.960 --> 00:20:45.560
Rader confessed to all 10 killings and received 10 consecutive life sentences

388
00:20:45.580 --> 00:20:48.600
and will spend the rest of his days in maximum security prison.

389
00:20:48.780 --> 00:20:51.840
So I'm not gonna ask whether you enjoyed that video, but I do hope you found it.
