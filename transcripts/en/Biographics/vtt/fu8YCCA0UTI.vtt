6
00:00:22.520 --> 00:00:25.670
<v 0>If you were asked to name the most important figure in modern Chinese history,</v>

7
00:00:25.700 --> 00:00:28.340
who would you pick the obvious answers chairman? Now,

8
00:00:28.341 --> 00:00:32.630
the communist leader who ruled the middle kingdom with an iron fist for over 25

9
00:00:32.631 --> 00:00:37.190
years, but there's another figure, at least as influential as Mau,

10
00:00:37.310 --> 00:00:41.690
his name Chiang Kai-shek modern China's longest serving roulette.

11
00:00:41.720 --> 00:00:46.460
Chiang Kai Shek started out as a low level revolutionary before rising to the

12
00:00:46.461 --> 00:00:48.710
very top of the Kuomintang.

13
00:00:48.800 --> 00:00:52.640
It was under his watch that China was reunified after his warlord era,

14
00:00:52.641 --> 00:00:55.730
that the prosperity of the Nanjing decade was ushered in.

15
00:00:55.970 --> 00:00:59.090
And that China took its place among the superpowers of the day.

16
00:00:59.150 --> 00:01:03.530
It was also under Chiang. That's a brutal Japanese invasion took place.

17
00:01:03.710 --> 00:01:06.350
The Mao's communists were allowed to gain and strengths,

18
00:01:06.620 --> 00:01:10.340
and that the deliberate flooding of the yellow river killed up to a million

19
00:01:10.341 --> 00:01:14.690
people, both the dictator and the Democrats, a Confucian and a Christian,

20
00:01:14.810 --> 00:01:19.430
an icon and a monster. This is the life of Chiang Kai Shek.

21
00:01:19.490 --> 00:01:21.800
The man who created modern China.

22
00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:27.890
<v 1>[Inaudible].</v>

23
00:01:27.890 --> 00:01:31.760
<v 0>When Chiang Kai-shek was born on October the 31st, 1887,</v>

24
00:01:31.940 --> 00:01:35.390
it was into an empire that was on the verge of collapse.

25
00:01:35.450 --> 00:01:38.630
The last century had been one of unparalleled catastrophe for China.

26
00:01:38.660 --> 00:01:41.600
There had been zop and Wars European colonization.

27
00:01:41.601 --> 00:01:44.180
The gigantic Taiping rebellion in short,

28
00:01:44.360 --> 00:01:47.390
the writing was on the wall for the Imperial family in Beijing.

29
00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:51.530
The Chinese parents could have had no way of knowing how he had helped dispose

30
00:01:51.531 --> 00:01:54.350
of them, especially since the family were doing pretty well.

31
00:01:54.710 --> 00:01:58.550
Chang's father owns a plantation that brought in 60 Mexican silver dollars a

32
00:01:58.551 --> 00:01:58.971
year,

33
00:01:58.971 --> 00:02:03.470
a huge sum by rural Chinese standards and just one of the many currencies and

34
00:02:03.471 --> 00:02:05.720
use at that time, when he died in 1895,

35
00:02:05.721 --> 00:02:09.440
the plantation passed to Chang making him comparatively wealthy. Yes,

36
00:02:09.530 --> 00:02:12.200
there was still something rotten below the surface.

37
00:02:12.201 --> 00:02:16.610
Something no one in China could then ignore its name was the Ching dynasty

38
00:02:16.670 --> 00:02:18.920
rulers of China since 1644,

39
00:02:18.950 --> 00:02:23.270
but as Chang would soon discover they wouldn't be around much longer in 1903.

40
00:02:23.270 --> 00:02:25.610
The boy ran away from his village to join the army.

41
00:02:25.700 --> 00:02:29.420
At the Belding military Academy, he came into contact with hundreds of Chinese,

42
00:02:29.421 --> 00:02:32.450
from rural backgrounds, all openly and teaching.

43
00:02:32.510 --> 00:02:35.300
By the time Chang left the Academy for Japan in 1907,

44
00:02:35.301 --> 00:02:37.940
he was already a diehard Republican at this stage.

45
00:02:37.970 --> 00:02:39.740
You might be wondering why on us.

46
00:02:39.741 --> 00:02:43.670
The future presidents of China would head off to Japan given that the two

47
00:02:43.671 --> 00:02:47.840
countries hated each other's guts, but that you can thank the Imperial army.

48
00:02:47.870 --> 00:02:49.070
Just a couple of years earlier,

49
00:02:49.100 --> 00:02:52.250
Japan had become the first Asian nation to beat a European power on the

50
00:02:52.850 --> 00:02:52.880
battlefield.

51
00:02:52.880 --> 00:02:57.200
When Russia lost the rustle Japanese war in 1905 for the Chinese who'd spent

52
00:02:57.201 --> 00:03:00.970
half a century watching their country get kicked around by colonial dishes.

53
00:03:01.240 --> 00:03:03.490
This had been an eyeopening moment.

54
00:03:03.550 --> 00:03:07.780
Plenty of young men hightailed it to Tokyo to learn war from the experts among

55
00:03:07.781 --> 00:03:08.680
them Chang.

56
00:03:08.890 --> 00:03:13.120
Then that was how Chiang Kai-shek came to spend four years serving in Japan's

57
00:03:13.121 --> 00:03:14.020
Imperial army.

58
00:03:14.230 --> 00:03:17.620
There was while abroad that Jan completed his journey to republicanism.

59
00:03:17.680 --> 00:03:19.330
He symbolically cut off his cue.

60
00:03:19.360 --> 00:03:23.830
That long braid of hatching subjects were legally obliged to wear and act to

61
00:03:23.980 --> 00:03:27.670
this marked him out as a revolutionary, sadly for Chang. He wouldn't be there.

62
00:03:27.671 --> 00:03:30.160
When the revolution actually came in 1911,

63
00:03:30.161 --> 00:03:34.240
a police raid on an underground bomb factory became the spark that ignited

64
00:03:34.510 --> 00:03:37.390
China's sing high revolution by December.

65
00:03:37.391 --> 00:03:40.960
Dozens of cities were an open revolt and a provisional governments had been set

66
00:03:40.970 --> 00:03:44.110
up in Nanjing under soon. Yet sin over in Japan,

67
00:03:44.530 --> 00:03:48.400
Chang had become something of a notorious womanizer keeping dozens of girls on

68
00:03:48.401 --> 00:03:50.690
the go at any one time. Now he ditched them all.

69
00:03:50.860 --> 00:03:52.150
Then hightailed it back to home.

70
00:03:52.151 --> 00:03:56.020
We like to imagine while stuffing away his trouser snake, as he ran,

71
00:03:56.050 --> 00:03:57.790
there was no way he was going to miss this.

72
00:03:57.880 --> 00:04:01.870
Unfortunately that's more or less what happens in January, 1912, Ching general,

73
00:04:01.871 --> 00:04:05.620
one Chicago talk to the Imperial family and to voluntarily giving up power on

74
00:04:05.621 --> 00:04:10.270
February the 12th, the boy Umbra Poony abdicated ending the revolution only,

75
00:04:10.390 --> 00:04:11.800
not quite within a year.

76
00:04:11.801 --> 00:04:15.400
The general one in Chicago had killed China's fledgling democracy,

77
00:04:15.430 --> 00:04:17.380
making himself military dictator.

78
00:04:17.410 --> 00:04:20.440
Suddenly Chanco Shaq had a cause that he could actually fight for.

79
00:04:20.530 --> 00:04:22.330
And he wouldn't let this opportunity go to waste.

80
00:04:29.370 --> 00:04:31.200
One's dictatorship lost his myth three years,

81
00:04:31.340 --> 00:04:32.760
but after three years of fighting Chiang,

82
00:04:32.761 --> 00:04:35.190
Kai Shek lived to see the general deposed,

83
00:04:35.220 --> 00:04:39.990
but rather than usher in a new era of peace and unicorns and rainbows one's

84
00:04:39.991 --> 00:04:44.640
downfall instead ushered in the warlord era with one gone former Ching General's

85
00:04:44.910 --> 00:04:49.710
role, like pretty much party time and started conquering, whatever they could.

86
00:04:49.920 --> 00:04:52.620
There was always China shattering into warring provinces,

87
00:04:52.890 --> 00:04:55.170
each headed by its own warlord. By now though,

88
00:04:55.171 --> 00:04:58.650
Chiang Kai-shek had had enough presumably with a mustard, whatever,

89
00:04:58.651 --> 00:05:00.000
dead the format,

90
00:05:00.001 --> 00:05:04.680
revolutionary moved to Shanghai and joins the Ching bang famous gang of opium

91
00:05:04.681 --> 00:05:09.450
traffickers. But this would be just a detour. The pause before his life story,

92
00:05:09.451 --> 00:05:13.800
proper could begin down in China's South Sunni out sin was growing in strength.

93
00:05:13.860 --> 00:05:16.440
In case you forgot him in the barrage of names we throw at you.

94
00:05:17.010 --> 00:05:20.400
Someone was the guy who declared the provincial governments in Nanjing during

95
00:05:20.401 --> 00:05:21.210
the revolution.

96
00:05:21.210 --> 00:05:24.810
Now leader of the Kuomintang also known as the KMT or nationalist party.

97
00:05:24.930 --> 00:05:27.480
He was also the country's most ambitious warlord,

98
00:05:27.930 --> 00:05:30.030
Sonia Sen plans to reunite China.

99
00:05:30.090 --> 00:05:34.050
It was a plan young Chanco shack could get on board with in 1918,

100
00:05:34.350 --> 00:05:39.150
Jang joins the KMT soon rising up the ranks. He was so competent. Let's in 1923,

101
00:05:39.180 --> 00:05:43.790
some trays them to go to the USSR to study Soviet tactics when Chang written and

102
00:05:43.800 --> 00:05:47.640
it was with Soviet advisors who quickly set about whipping the KMD national

103
00:05:47.641 --> 00:05:51.810
revolutionary army into shape. It was the start of a world changing movements.

104
00:05:51.900 --> 00:05:55.590
It was in the new form that the Kanzi started admitting communists once that

105
00:05:55.591 --> 00:05:59.180
mortal enemies, although some worried, this would empower the KMT is hard,

106
00:05:59.181 --> 00:06:03.740
left it soon, turned out that underestimated Chung's cunning on March the 12th,

107
00:06:03.741 --> 00:06:06.200
1925 sung out sene died of cancer,

108
00:06:06.230 --> 00:06:10.460
but not before outlining a detailed plan for crushing the warlords reunifying

109
00:06:10.461 --> 00:06:12.950
China and slowly implementing democracy.

110
00:06:13.490 --> 00:06:16.820
Chanco shank was named as successor and spent the next year preparing a massive

111
00:06:16.821 --> 00:06:19.760
campaign against the warlords. Then on the Eve of battle,

112
00:06:20.180 --> 00:06:22.970
Chang pulled off a breathtakingly ballsy move.

113
00:06:23.090 --> 00:06:27.560
The cans on CU saw the arrest of prominent communists and the exile of the KMT

114
00:06:27.561 --> 00:06:30.020
Soviet advisors. It was a risky play.

115
00:06:30.170 --> 00:06:33.200
One that could have sparked a civil war in the coning Tang,

116
00:06:33.380 --> 00:06:37.880
but Chang had picked his moment perfectly with his upcoming Northern expedition.

117
00:06:37.881 --> 00:06:39.620
The only chance to crush the warlords,

118
00:06:39.650 --> 00:06:41.930
even the remaining communists stayed loyal.

119
00:06:42.140 --> 00:06:46.730
It was a decision that deeply regret from 1926 to 1928,

120
00:06:46.731 --> 00:06:50.810
Chung's Northern expedition toppled warlord after warlord by 1927,

121
00:06:50.811 --> 00:06:53.540
it was so obvious that the KMT was going to unite China,

122
00:06:53.541 --> 00:06:58.040
that Jan was able to do the communist [inaudible] on April the 12th KMD troops

123
00:06:58.041 --> 00:06:58.671
in Shanghai,

124
00:06:58.671 --> 00:07:03.560
joined forces with the chain bang to mass execute up to 5,000 communists.

125
00:07:03.620 --> 00:07:07.550
It was the start of a wave of violence that left the hard left, broken,

126
00:07:07.820 --> 00:07:12.770
and Chang in the ascendancy. Finally in late 1928, the KMT captured Beijing.

127
00:07:12.830 --> 00:07:16.280
The last remaining warlords, they swore fealty against all odds.

128
00:07:16.310 --> 00:07:19.670
Chiang Kai-shek had done it hit fulfilled his old mentor,

129
00:07:19.671 --> 00:07:21.040
sending out sends plans,

130
00:07:21.620 --> 00:07:25.760
heads North and reunify China under a single government now only needed to do

131
00:07:25.761 --> 00:07:29.360
was finished the implementing democracy part and it'd be done.

132
00:07:29.660 --> 00:07:32.270
And yeah, about that,

133
00:07:32.420 --> 00:07:35.570
it turns out democracy wasn't particularly high on Chang's things.

134
00:07:35.571 --> 00:07:37.460
I care about list in no time.

135
00:07:37.580 --> 00:07:40.310
It's all the former revolutionary was going to become the very person.

136
00:07:40.311 --> 00:07:42.050
The masses were ultimate against.

137
00:07:48.040 --> 00:07:48.220
<v 3>[Inaudible].</v>

138
00:07:48.220 --> 00:07:49.720
<v 0>Even before taking Beijing,</v>

139
00:07:49.721 --> 00:07:52.990
the Cuming Tang had established a new capital that would give its names.

140
00:07:53.080 --> 00:07:56.320
The coming year out then entering decade was a time of relative peace and

141
00:07:56.321 --> 00:08:00.970
prosperity for China under Chang the Republic embarked on a modernization spree.

142
00:08:01.180 --> 00:08:03.760
That's all things like expanded education opportunities,

143
00:08:03.761 --> 00:08:04.900
industrial developments,

144
00:08:04.901 --> 00:08:08.290
and massive road building for those who've lived through the warlord era and

145
00:08:09.220 --> 00:08:13.330
[inaudible] half-ass dictatorship before that. And Mr seemed like a golden age,

146
00:08:13.420 --> 00:08:16.210
but only compared to what had come before objectively.

147
00:08:16.211 --> 00:08:19.030
The Nanjing decade was the sets by problems.

148
00:08:19.060 --> 00:08:21.790
The first was the KMT vice-like grip on government.

149
00:08:21.970 --> 00:08:24.190
When Sonia at Sam had envisioned a dictatorship,

150
00:08:24.310 --> 00:08:27.310
the transitions do a democracy is proteges rural,

151
00:08:27.311 --> 00:08:29.350
like we're good.

152
00:08:29.530 --> 00:08:33.310
There was a secret police that arrested or assassinated dissidents among Chang's

153
00:08:33.760 --> 00:08:34.870
generals. Corruption was rampant.

154
00:08:34.960 --> 00:08:38.140
It probably didn't help that Chang had recently converted to Christianity and

155
00:08:38.141 --> 00:08:41.290
married into the extremely wealthy song family for the dirt,

156
00:08:41.291 --> 00:08:44.440
poor Buddhist peasants that made up 90% of China's population.

157
00:08:44.590 --> 00:08:48.280
It must've seemed like the generalist Sumo was from another world,

158
00:08:48.430 --> 00:08:52.420
but the real reason the Nanjing decade was doomed can be summed up in three

159
00:08:52.421 --> 00:08:54.970
words, warlords communists,

160
00:08:55.260 --> 00:08:57.900
Japan let's tackle the communists first,

161
00:08:58.110 --> 00:09:02.220
despite Chang's 1927 purge the communists hadn't been wiped out that simply

162
00:09:02.250 --> 00:09:05.820
retreated to that countryside base in Jang Xi province,

163
00:09:05.850 --> 00:09:10.410
where they continued to plot revolution only now they were doing it against the

164
00:09:10.411 --> 00:09:13.890
KMT. His parts Chang tried time and time again to wipe them out,

165
00:09:13.920 --> 00:09:15.810
throwing armies that Chang she,

166
00:09:15.811 --> 00:09:19.530
until we finally had the communists surrounds it in October of 1934,

167
00:09:19.680 --> 00:09:21.420
but even this would go horribly wrong.

168
00:09:21.421 --> 00:09:25.050
When the communists broke through the lines and spent the next year marching the

169
00:09:25.060 --> 00:09:29.970
6,000 kilometers to the new base in Shang sheen known as the long March,

170
00:09:30.000 --> 00:09:31.560
the narrow escape became the communist,

171
00:09:31.650 --> 00:09:35.430
its foundational myth and inspired tens of thousands of people to join them.

172
00:09:35.460 --> 00:09:39.540
It also led to the rise of the undisputed leader, chairman Mao,

173
00:09:39.720 --> 00:09:43.860
but despite being indestructable the communists weren't China's biggest threat,

174
00:09:44.040 --> 00:09:46.440
that would be James' old inspiration.

175
00:09:46.680 --> 00:09:49.470
The Imperial army of Japan in September, 1931,

176
00:09:49.471 --> 00:09:53.730
Tokyo used a false flag attack to invade an occupied Manchuria in China's

177
00:09:53.731 --> 00:09:57.850
Northeast establishing a sadistic puppet state under the former boy emperor

178
00:09:58.380 --> 00:09:58.741
[inaudible] yes,

179
00:09:58.741 --> 00:10:01.980
even as Japan used mentioned area as a staging post for annexing,

180
00:10:01.981 --> 00:10:06.450
more Chinese territory, Jang refused to stop focusing on the communist threat.

181
00:10:06.570 --> 00:10:11.160
As the decades slipped by this became more and more nonsensical by 1935,

182
00:10:11.161 --> 00:10:15.180
the Imperial army had annex parts of Hebei province and modern in Mongolia.

183
00:10:15.210 --> 00:10:17.280
They were starting to encircle Beijing. Yet.

184
00:10:17.790 --> 00:10:21.330
Chang had insisted on sending his troops chasing off after chairman. Now,

185
00:10:21.450 --> 00:10:25.830
now this leads us neatly to the Nanjing decades, final fatal floor.

186
00:10:26.190 --> 00:10:28.440
The warlords when the Northern expedition ended,

187
00:10:28.441 --> 00:10:29.940
not all warlords had been defeated.

188
00:10:29.970 --> 00:10:34.260
Some simply switched to nominal support of the KMT while maintaining their own

189
00:10:34.320 --> 00:10:35.220
power bases.

190
00:10:35.280 --> 00:10:39.990
One of these was [inaudible] in Cheyenne dude who felt China should really be

191
00:10:39.991 --> 00:10:43.530
focusing on these Japanese invaders rather than worrying about a bunch of

192
00:10:43.560 --> 00:10:44.340
commies.

193
00:10:44.340 --> 00:10:49.200
So he just straight up kidnapped him taking place over the winter of 1936,

194
00:10:49.201 --> 00:10:54.060
the Shan incidents was an Epic humiliation for Chang Jang held him prisoner for

195
00:10:54.061 --> 00:10:57.890
two weeks until basically said, okay, you win.

196
00:10:58.040 --> 00:11:01.790
I promise I'll stop fighting. Whereas now Jesus Christ,

197
00:11:01.880 --> 00:11:04.010
all those yang would be arrested after freeing.

198
00:11:04.011 --> 00:11:07.880
The generally Simo air was now too late for the game Dee to change its mind in

199
00:11:07.881 --> 00:11:08.990
early 1937,

200
00:11:08.991 --> 00:11:13.310
the Cuming tannins communists forms the second United front to counter any

201
00:11:13.311 --> 00:11:17.780
further Japanese invasions. They sealed their packs just in time. Now,

202
00:11:17.810 --> 00:11:19.370
just before we continue with today's video,

203
00:11:19.371 --> 00:11:22.100

it's a great fit. So yeah, link below and let's get back into it.

227
00:12:36.770 --> 00:12:39.240
It came to China on the 7th of July, 1937,

228
00:12:39.300 --> 00:12:42.360
that evening a skirmish with Japanese troops that the Marco polo bridge

229
00:12:42.361 --> 00:12:47.040
snowballed into the second Sino-Japanese war. It was like opening a flood gate.

230
00:12:47.070 --> 00:12:51.390
The Imperial army swept across China, capturing Beijing, Tianjin,

231
00:12:51.420 --> 00:12:54.660
Shanghai and Nanjing come January, 1938.

232
00:12:54.661 --> 00:12:57.180
The governments had been forced to move the capital to Wu Han,

233
00:12:57.360 --> 00:12:59.370
but even that was under threat.

234
00:12:59.490 --> 00:13:02.400
Although the KMT had the communists and warlords on side.

235
00:13:02.401 --> 00:13:06.540
Now this was just extra Canon Volta for a well-oiled fighting machine,

236
00:13:06.541 --> 00:13:07.680
like the Imperial army.

237
00:13:07.770 --> 00:13:12.720
It was sort of like trying to take down Gingiss Khan by teaming up with the

238
00:13:12.721 --> 00:13:14.940
mighty ducks by some in 1938,

239
00:13:14.941 --> 00:13:19.260
Japanese bombers were devastating cities as the army closed in on UConn,

240
00:13:19.320 --> 00:13:20.760
it was in the face of this threat.

241
00:13:21.030 --> 00:13:23.550
Chiang Kai-shek made his most controversial decision.

242
00:13:23.551 --> 00:13:27.720
Yet the Imperial army was advancing across the yellow river flood plain swath of

243
00:13:27.721 --> 00:13:30.780
lands where powerful floods occasionally washed away millions.

244
00:13:30.810 --> 00:13:33.600
So why not flood it deliberately on June the ninth,

245
00:13:33.601 --> 00:13:38.550
1938 KMT troops acting under Chang's orders blew up 17 kilometers

246
00:13:38.551 --> 00:13:43.500
of, substituting water for soldiers. No warning was given to the civilians.

247
00:13:43.560 --> 00:13:46.950
When the dynamite went off, the river came surging out drowning.

248
00:13:46.951 --> 00:13:51.870
The country's heart today it's estimated that 890,000 people died

249
00:13:51.871 --> 00:13:56.040
in the 1938 yellow river flood and maybe another 3 million and the subsequent

250
00:13:56.340 --> 00:13:59.760
Fran and almost all of them, Chinese peasants, nor did the waters slow.

251
00:13:59.770 --> 00:14:00.990
The Japanese. In fact,

252
00:14:00.991 --> 00:14:05.160
breaching the was so useless that Jan blamed it on Tokyo and the way he gives

253
00:14:05.161 --> 00:14:07.170
the failed flood, Jang retreated again,

254
00:14:07.200 --> 00:14:11.730
establishing a new wartime capital in Chung, Ching. And once there he did well,

255
00:14:11.790 --> 00:14:12.750
absolutely nothing.

256
00:14:12.960 --> 00:14:16.860
It's common to criticize Chang's actions in this part of the war when his entire

257
00:14:16.861 --> 00:14:19.980
strategy revolved around waiting for the U S to save as,

258
00:14:19.981 --> 00:14:22.140
but let's what else could he do?

259
00:14:22.290 --> 00:14:26.070
There was no way the KMT even with the communists would be able to defeat

260
00:14:26.071 --> 00:14:26.970
Imperial Japan.

261
00:14:27.180 --> 00:14:31.980
That's a just keep your head down and wait for Tokyo to slip up and slip up.

262
00:14:31.981 --> 00:14:35.100
They did the Japanese advance had been so Swift and China,

263
00:14:35.110 --> 00:14:39.480
so vast that Tokyo found itself unable to police behind its own lines.

264
00:14:39.540 --> 00:14:43.020
This allowed communist partisans and warlord armies to attack and destroy

265
00:14:43.050 --> 00:14:44.790
Japanese supplies almost at will.

266
00:14:45.150 --> 00:14:48.690
It should have been a fatal mistake for the Imperial army. Unfortunately,

267
00:14:49.170 --> 00:14:51.920
Jack was having problems of his own as the 19 dawns,

268
00:14:51.921 --> 00:14:56.270
the Chongjin governments plummeted in popularity. There was inflation shortages,

269
00:14:56.780 --> 00:14:57.770
ramping corruption in the KMT,

270
00:14:57.771 --> 00:15:01.400
even as it taxed the living crap out of everyone else. Oh,

271
00:15:01.490 --> 00:15:05.630
and that whole thing about chairman Mao working with Jang turns out both leaders

272
00:15:05.780 --> 00:15:09.140
had been crossing their fingers behind their backs as the war raged around them,

273
00:15:09.141 --> 00:15:12.920
the KMT and communists clashed each blaming the other F at the mounting death

274
00:15:12.921 --> 00:15:15.590
toll. And in fact, China split into three nations,

275
00:15:16.190 --> 00:15:17.150
nationalist China in the West,

276
00:15:17.180 --> 00:15:20.510
communist China in the North and Japanese China in the East.

277
00:15:20.600 --> 00:15:22.910
It was an impossible state of affairs.

278
00:15:23.000 --> 00:15:27.380
One that demanded a clear winner to unify the fractured land for a long time.

279
00:15:27.381 --> 00:15:30.920
It looked like the winner would be Chiang Kai Shek on December the seventh,

280
00:15:30.921 --> 00:15:35.660
1941, the Japanese committed a gargantuan bulls up by attacking Pearl Harbor.

281
00:15:35.840 --> 00:15:39.500
As America came crashing into world war two China's position was elevated from

282
00:15:39.770 --> 00:15:44.270
desperate underdog to one of the big four allies placing Chang alongside

283
00:15:44.300 --> 00:15:47.930
FDR Churchill and Stalin. Great as this was though,

284
00:15:47.990 --> 00:15:49.820
it wouldn't be until 1944,

285
00:15:49.821 --> 00:15:53.000
that Japan was weak enough for the us to actually start supplying China with

286
00:15:53.001 --> 00:15:56.090
material help even then with American guys flooding in Chang,

287
00:15:56.450 --> 00:15:58.280
still committed some terrible mistakes,

288
00:15:58.370 --> 00:16:00.340
terrified as generals might try to overthrow,

289
00:16:00.440 --> 00:16:03.320
and he deliberately kept vulnerable supplies back from his own army.

290
00:16:03.380 --> 00:16:07.100
By this stage, though, no amount of mistakes could slow Japan's collapse.

291
00:16:07.220 --> 00:16:08.120
In 1945,

292
00:16:08.121 --> 00:16:11.840
Tokyo pulls back from China to concentrate on defending the homelands into this

293
00:16:11.841 --> 00:16:16.160
power vacuum swept Mao's communists liberated city after city in the East,

294
00:16:16.190 --> 00:16:20.420
leaving the KMT scrambling for a propaganda when it was the start of a complete

295
00:16:20.421 --> 00:16:21.950
breakdown between the two armies,

296
00:16:21.980 --> 00:16:26.000
the ends of what will remain of the United front in no time at all,

297
00:16:26.001 --> 00:16:30.230
China was going to transition from a catastrophic deadly war with a foreign

298
00:16:30.231 --> 00:16:33.110
power to a catastrophic, the deadly civil.

299
00:16:33.550 --> 00:16:34.383
<v 1>Yes.</v>

300
00:16:39.970 --> 00:16:42.430
<v 0>You were an ordinary Chinese peasant in 1945.</v>

301
00:16:42.431 --> 00:16:47.290
You might have not unreasonably been thinking something along the lines of well,

302
00:16:47.350 --> 00:16:49.360
hooray peace at last,

303
00:16:49.420 --> 00:16:53.740
but no sooner had Japan surrendered than the Chinese civil war was revving right

304
00:16:53.741 --> 00:16:57.730
back off. So that credits both Chang and Maui tried to negotiate a peace deal.

305
00:16:57.760 --> 00:17:01.960
But although they announced a framework for talks on October the 10th by then

306
00:17:02.020 --> 00:17:03.310
war was already underway.

307
00:17:03.370 --> 00:17:08.050
And so we come to the single most damning facts in the life of Chiang Kai

308
00:17:08.051 --> 00:17:10.390
Shek. He should have won the civil war.

309
00:17:10.600 --> 00:17:15.520
When negotiations broke down in 1946, the KMT seemed poised for victory.

310
00:17:15.700 --> 00:17:18.970
They had more troops, more areas under their control, better equipments,

311
00:17:19.240 --> 00:17:23.290
at least partial American backing that fool his KMT troops lead sieged,

312
00:17:23.620 --> 00:17:24.190
communist cities,

313
00:17:24.190 --> 00:17:28.750
Jang oversaw the opening of a new national assembly purged of all leftists.

314
00:17:28.810 --> 00:17:30.550
Had you been betting on the outcome of the war?

315
00:17:30.640 --> 00:17:34.810
You wouldn't have even considered now a long shot. So what the hell happens,

316
00:17:35.580 --> 00:17:39.580
assemble answer hubris. All the KMZ were concentrating on taking the cities.

317
00:17:39.581 --> 00:17:42.100
The communists were focusing on the countryside.

318
00:17:42.430 --> 00:17:45.670
Remember how we said that 90% of China's population were peasants.

319
00:17:45.700 --> 00:17:47.200
Well now certainly remembered.

320
00:17:47.201 --> 00:17:51.240
And he knew it didn't matter how many Chang took so long as the communists out

321
00:17:51.241 --> 00:17:54.960
the peasants on side, they would be unstoppable by 1947.

322
00:17:54.990 --> 00:17:57.330
The tide had begun to turn that summer at us.

323
00:17:57.331 --> 00:18:01.080
Fact-finding mission globally reported that now's victory was inevitable,

324
00:18:01.110 --> 00:18:06.060
but it would take another year before Chang realized this simple and tragic fact

325
00:18:06.210 --> 00:18:11.010
come 1948 KMD soldiers were defecting in droves to Mao's red army from holding

326
00:18:11.040 --> 00:18:13.830
one 10th of Chinese territory at the outbreak of the civil war.

327
00:18:13.950 --> 00:18:16.560
The communists now held onto a third on September,

328
00:18:16.561 --> 00:18:19.800
the first day proclaims the North China people's governments. Meanwhile,

329
00:18:19.801 --> 00:18:21.000
in nationalist territory,

330
00:18:21.360 --> 00:18:24.330
Chang was having serious problems to cope with the costs of the war.

331
00:18:24.331 --> 00:18:27.030
The KMT had started printing money and surprisingly,

332
00:18:27.090 --> 00:18:31.140
this led to runaway inflation to counter Chang brought in harsh punishments for

333
00:18:31.350 --> 00:18:34.170
economic crimes like hoarding. But by now,

334
00:18:34.210 --> 00:18:37.740
corruption was so entrenched that KMT officials flouted the rules,

335
00:18:37.741 --> 00:18:40.980
openly strikes, protests, and unrest paralyzed,

336
00:18:40.981 --> 00:18:44.640
the cities and morale plummeted. Finally in late 1948,

337
00:18:45.030 --> 00:18:46.350
Chiang was forced to swallow his pride.

338
00:18:46.440 --> 00:18:49.500
He sent a message to Mau saying he wished to negotiate in Roseanne.

339
00:18:49.501 --> 00:18:53.040
The chairman published a list of wanted war criminals with Chang's name at the

340
00:18:53.041 --> 00:18:56.910
top that January, 1949 Janko Shaq resigned as president of China.

341
00:18:57.120 --> 00:18:59.790
His successes desperately tried to come to terms with mal,

342
00:18:59.791 --> 00:19:02.760
but by now the communists were unstoppable on April.

343
00:19:02.761 --> 00:19:06.120
The 19th negotiations finally collapsed within five days.

344
00:19:06.121 --> 00:19:07.860
The communists with marching on Nanjing,

345
00:19:08.040 --> 00:19:10.680
the KMT dream of ruling China was over on June.

346
00:19:10.680 --> 00:19:14.490
The second Jang was recalled and made ahead of the nationalist forces,

347
00:19:14.520 --> 00:19:18.930
but his new role was simply to make sure that they all escaped alive as the

348
00:19:19.380 --> 00:19:21.750
communists swept the last few pockets of resistance away,

349
00:19:22.230 --> 00:19:25.980
Chang organized the evacuation of around 2 million nationalists to the Island of

350
00:19:25.981 --> 00:19:27.480
Taiwan. On the 1st of October,

351
00:19:27.481 --> 00:19:30.420
1949 chairman now declared victory in the civil war,

352
00:19:30.540 --> 00:19:33.630
establishing the people's Republic of China barely two months later,

353
00:19:33.990 --> 00:19:36.570
Chang and the rest of the nationalists evacuated the mainlands.

354
00:19:36.960 --> 00:19:40.950
Their plan was to regroup on Taiwan and someday return, but they never did.

355
00:19:41.130 --> 00:19:41.970
In any other video.

356
00:19:42.030 --> 00:19:45.300
This might be the point where the story ends it's with Chanco Shaq,

357
00:19:45.310 --> 00:19:47.520
watching the mainland received over the waters,

358
00:19:47.521 --> 00:19:50.910
his dreams and tatters his reputation shot,

359
00:19:51.240 --> 00:19:55.410
but not in this video because the life of Chiang Kai-shek still has one more

360
00:19:55.650 --> 00:19:57.900
important chapter left to go.

361
00:19:58.260 --> 00:20:02.850
It's time to watch the general generalist Simo turn from an abject failure and

362
00:20:02.851 --> 00:20:04.770
to Taiwan's founding father.

363
00:20:11.030 --> 00:20:11.810
<v 4>Do you understand.</v>

364
00:20:11.810 --> 00:20:13.880
<v 0>Taiwan became the KMD is the last holdout.</v>

365
00:20:14.030 --> 00:20:18.770
We have to go back to 1945 when Tokyo surrendered Taiwan had spent 50 years

366
00:20:18.980 --> 00:20:22.370
as an Imperial possession, but rather than be returned to China,

367
00:20:22.610 --> 00:20:25.910
it was handed solely to the KMT for local Taiwanese.

368
00:20:25.940 --> 00:20:30.560
This kind of sucked the nationalists considered them Japanese collaborators

369
00:20:31.010 --> 00:20:34.970
Chiang even appointed the racist Jen Yi as the Island's military governor and

370
00:20:34.971 --> 00:20:38.390
allowed him to plunger its resources and to brutalize its natives.

371
00:20:38.391 --> 00:20:42.830
Without restraints things reached ahead is on February the 27th, 1947.

372
00:20:42.831 --> 00:20:45.470
When KMT agents beat an elderly woman in the street,

373
00:20:45.650 --> 00:20:49.570
sparking a mass demonstration ended with several times when he's being shot,

374
00:20:49.870 --> 00:20:51.640
dead known as the two to eight incidents.

375
00:20:51.820 --> 00:20:55.780
It launched an Island wide uprising that Odie ended when Changs and didn't

376
00:20:55.781 --> 00:21:00.370
troops and told them to let rip for an entire month Kanzi soldiers were allowed

377
00:21:00.371 --> 00:21:03.850
to run rod across Taiwan. Civilians were machine gun for sports.

378
00:21:03.880 --> 00:21:07.390
Women were raped and people were to capitated in the streets.

379
00:21:07.480 --> 00:21:11.860
By the time order was restored up to 28,000 Taiwanese had been murdered

380
00:21:12.130 --> 00:21:16.330
incredibly. This was just the start of KMT white terror.

381
00:21:16.480 --> 00:21:18.790
Fast forward to May, 1949.

382
00:21:18.791 --> 00:21:22.780
When chairman now is on the verge of victory ahead of evacuating to the islands,

383
00:21:23.200 --> 00:21:25.000
Chang declared martial law in Taiwan,

384
00:21:25.210 --> 00:21:29.080
effectively setting up a dictatorship while Chang's dictatorship would be way

385
00:21:29.081 --> 00:21:30.850
less bloody than mows on the main lines.

386
00:21:31.120 --> 00:21:34.990
It was still a pretty hideous affair lasting until July, 1987.

387
00:21:34.991 --> 00:21:39.100
Martial law saw the kidnapping and murder of anyone who opposed the KMT regime

388
00:21:39.250 --> 00:21:43.750
somewhere in the region of 3,500 were executed often on just fabricated

389
00:21:43.751 --> 00:21:46.450
charges for democracy. This was not,

390
00:21:46.570 --> 00:21:50.020
but no one was at a total disaster in the early days of Chang's rule.

391
00:21:50.080 --> 00:21:54.400
It wasn't certain Taiwan would stay independence now toyed with taking the

392
00:21:54.401 --> 00:21:57.280
islands and it was broadly assumes that he could do.

393
00:21:57.280 --> 00:21:58.870
So if he wished to in Washington,

394
00:21:58.871 --> 00:22:02.020
the state department even considered removing Chiang from power themselves,

395
00:22:02.050 --> 00:22:04.180
but then things started to change.

396
00:22:04.300 --> 00:22:06.700
The first was China getting involved in the Korean war,

397
00:22:06.701 --> 00:22:09.400
which made the U S super keen on supporting Taiwan,

398
00:22:09.610 --> 00:22:12.760
concluding a defense treaty with Taipei in 1955.

399
00:22:12.790 --> 00:22:17.020
The second change was Taiwan's economic miracle realizing the SIM odds of his

400
00:22:17.021 --> 00:22:17.381
regime,

401
00:22:17.381 --> 00:22:21.730
survival Jang embarked on a modernization drive to transform the Island into a

402
00:22:21.731 --> 00:22:25.300
base of manufacturing by focusing on fabrics and consumer electronics,

403
00:22:25.301 --> 00:22:29.950
the KMT government kick-started and economic boom that saw Taiwan outstrip,

404
00:22:30.070 --> 00:22:32.800
the dysfunctional mainland by the late 1950s,

405
00:22:33.220 --> 00:22:37.450
Chiang was even working hard to root out corruption in the KMT and making sure

406
00:22:37.480 --> 00:22:40.120
each of the islands ethnicities benefited from his rule.

407
00:22:40.180 --> 00:22:44.950
If you sort of squinted and ignored the political executions and the lack of

408
00:22:44.951 --> 00:22:49.950
democracy you could was convinced yourself his rule was benign. Yeah.

409
00:22:50.580 --> 00:22:55.410
Chang would be cursed live long enough to see the winds change yet again in

410
00:22:55.411 --> 00:23:00.150
1971, a vote at the UN. So all Taipei lose China's seat to Beijing.

411
00:23:00.270 --> 00:23:03.690
The beginning of Taiwan's waning influence. Just one year later,

412
00:23:03.691 --> 00:23:06.930
president Nixon made a surprise visit to mainland China,

413
00:23:06.960 --> 00:23:11.590
turning the PRC from a pariah into a global player by the decades,

414
00:23:11.880 --> 00:23:15.510
Zen countries would be breaking off diplomatic relations with Taipei in droves

415
00:23:15.511 --> 00:23:20.250
to cozy up to Beijing. But by then, Chiang Kai-shek was no longer around. Well,

416
00:23:20.251 --> 00:23:23.820
the fifth, 1975 Chang died of renal failure in Taiwan.

417
00:23:23.940 --> 00:23:27.450
A month of mourning was declared slightly over a year later on September the

418
00:23:27.451 --> 00:23:31.710
ninth, 1976, chairman Mao also passed away. And with that,

419
00:23:31.890 --> 00:23:36.000
the two most important men in modern Chinese history, when I'm off today,

420
00:23:36.030 --> 00:23:39.870
Chiang Kai-shek legacy remains controversial while it's tempting to hold him up

421
00:23:39.871 --> 00:23:44.310
as a Saint compared to chairman Mao, being less of a colossal Dixon mows,

422
00:23:44.311 --> 00:23:49.070
a dong is kind of a low bar to clear lest we forget the general

423
00:23:49.480 --> 00:23:52.580
SMO was the man who killed millions flooding the LA river,

424
00:23:52.820 --> 00:23:57.050
who deliberately starved the troops of rival generals of supplies during a

425
00:23:57.051 --> 00:24:01.760
catastrophic war whose hubris led to mouse communists winning mainland China

426
00:24:01.940 --> 00:24:06.500
in Taiwan to Chang's legacy is unsettled while plenty cm as a founding father,

427
00:24:06.710 --> 00:24:11.270
plenty more seen as the who murdered thousands for the crime of wanting

428
00:24:11.271 --> 00:24:12.590
democracy in shorts,

429
00:24:12.591 --> 00:24:16.250
we can't claim he was much of a hero or even a great leader.

430
00:24:16.580 --> 00:24:20.120
What Shankar shack was though was significant as the general,

431
00:24:20.121 --> 00:24:23.030
who ended the warlord era oversaw the Nanjing decade,

432
00:24:23.150 --> 00:24:27.470
stared China through a Japanese invasion and a civil war than founded modern

433
00:24:27.471 --> 00:24:31.550
Taiwan. Chiang has an outsized impact on East Asian history,

434
00:24:31.760 --> 00:24:33.770
perhaps more so than anyone else.

435
00:24:33.920 --> 00:24:38.720
His story may be one of corruption and incompetence of dictatorship and death,

436
00:24:39.050 --> 00:24:43.460
but it's also the story of a nobody who grabs the reigns of history and refuse

437
00:24:43.461 --> 00:24:45.380
to let go for better or worse.

438
00:24:45.440 --> 00:24:49.070
Our world today is still shaped by Chiang Kai-shek actions.

439
00:24:49.100 --> 00:24:53.660
We can think of no greater compliment to give the general emo than that.

440
00:24:54.260 --> 00:24:56.210
