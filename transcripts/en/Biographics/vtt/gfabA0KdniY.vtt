The law police big brother room 1 0 1. Even if you've never heard the name,

6
00:00:25.431 --> 00:00:26.250
George Orwell,

7
00:00:26.250 --> 00:00:30.950
you've heard of the concepts he created as the legendary writer of animal

8
00:00:31.100 --> 00:00:35.470
farm Orwell took the volatile politics of the time he lived in and used them to

9
00:00:35.471 --> 00:00:38.790
create twisted dystopia and Savage SATs.

10
00:00:38.930 --> 00:00:41.260
His 1984 is a Cryer ed,

11
00:00:41.350 --> 00:00:44.980
still bands by repressive regimes around the world. Even now,

12
00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:49.780
nearly 70 years after his death belly a day goes by without some

13
00:00:49.781 --> 00:00:53.340
media personality describing something as Orwellian,

14
00:00:53.341 --> 00:00:57.700
perhaps more so than any other writer of his era or Well's work is still

15
00:00:57.710 --> 00:01:00.300
powerfully relevant today. Yet,

16
00:01:00.520 --> 00:01:04.850
how much do we really he know about Britain's greatest modern writer born in the

17
00:01:04.851 --> 00:01:09.010
early years of the 20th century, Orwell was a man of fascinating contradictions.

18
00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:12.370
He was a socialist who studied at Britain's most elite school,

19
00:01:12.530 --> 00:01:16.850
a passionate defender of oppressed people who despised Catholics and homosexuals

20
00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:19.370
and a committed atheist who won his deathbed,

21
00:01:19.450 --> 00:01:21.690
demanded a Christian funeral in today's video.

22
00:01:22.360 --> 00:01:26.560
We're traveling inside the minds of this complex man and discovering the origins

23
00:01:26.740 --> 00:01:28.120
of his most famous works.

24
00:01:34.450 --> 00:01:36.840
Given all Well's veneration of the working classes,

25
00:01:37.060 --> 00:01:41.120
you might expect to hear that he was born in straighten circumstances. Well,

26
00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:44.670
actually not a bit of when Allwell was born on June the 25th,

27
00:01:44.990 --> 00:01:49.510
1903 in Maha Bengal, it was into a family with claims to form a greatness.

28
00:01:49.610 --> 00:01:51.870
His great-grandfather had been a wealthy slave owner.

29
00:01:51.880 --> 00:01:55.070
Who'd married into the British aristocracy, leaving his family,

30
00:01:55.350 --> 00:01:57.710
a fat pile of money to live on. Unfortunately,

31
00:01:57.810 --> 00:02:01.910
it hadn't quite been fat enough and by the time Allwell first opened his eyes,

32
00:02:02.170 --> 00:02:05.820
his father rich and had been reduced working for the British civil service in

33
00:02:05.821 --> 00:02:09.020
India. Despite this both Richard and Orwell's young mother,

34
00:02:09.580 --> 00:02:13.620
Ida tried to act as if they were still as rich as ever creating what Orwell

35
00:02:13.621 --> 00:02:16.940
later called an atmosphere of impoverished snobbery.

36
00:02:17.080 --> 00:02:19.420
Not that Allwell was actually Orwell at this point.

37
00:02:19.540 --> 00:02:22.100
Orwell's birth name was Eric Arthur Blair.

38
00:02:22.120 --> 00:02:26.050
He wouldn't come up with his famous pseudonym until he was 30. Still.

39
00:02:26.051 --> 00:02:29.210
We're just gonna go ahead and use George Orwell when referring to him throughout

40
00:02:29.211 --> 00:02:31.090
this video, because well, partly it's easier.

41
00:02:31.230 --> 00:02:36.050
And partly because it's gonna annoy any massive penance watching in 1905

42
00:02:36.150 --> 00:02:40.970
or 1906 Orwell's life in India came to an abrupt halt when Ida took him and

43
00:02:40.971 --> 00:02:43.850
his sister back to England for their education. At first,

44
00:02:43.851 --> 00:02:47.160
this meant attending a small Anglican school, not too far from Oxford,

45
00:02:47.700 --> 00:02:52.080
but then Allwell turned 11 and his mother shun him off to saints.

46
00:02:52.520 --> 00:02:56.960
A fashionable proprietary school near the sea sinces was exactly the sort of

47
00:02:56.961 --> 00:03:01.880
place a respectable English family with aristocratic links might send their boy.

48
00:03:02.370 --> 00:03:04.640
Sadly Orwell's family was by now.

49
00:03:04.641 --> 00:03:08.440
So impoverished that there were anything but respectable and his new schoolmates

50
00:03:08.460 --> 00:03:11.960
didn't let him forget it. In a future essay on his school days, such,

51
00:03:11.990 --> 00:03:15.840
such with a joys Orwell would paint his life at Sipri and EZ.

52
00:03:16.160 --> 00:03:20.750
One spent at the mercy of snobs piled upon knobs with everyone Horning over

53
00:03:20.751 --> 00:03:25.510
those above them and SNA those below them still cents did its job.

54
00:03:25.650 --> 00:03:28.030
As a proprietary school by 1917,

55
00:03:28.050 --> 00:03:31.390
Orwell was prepared enough to win a scholarship, to eat a private school.

56
00:03:31.391 --> 00:03:34.270
That's long been synonymous with posh bastards,

57
00:03:34.790 --> 00:03:38.470
not that Eden and Orwell into the respectable pillar of the establishment that

58
00:03:38.830 --> 00:03:39.940
his pat Aarons were hoping for.

59
00:03:40.080 --> 00:03:43.740
It was while there that young Orwell began to cultivate his lifelong distrust of

60
00:03:43.741 --> 00:03:47.420
authority figures to immerse himself in the works of socialist writers.

61
00:03:47.800 --> 00:03:50.140
By the time Orwell graduated in 1921,

62
00:03:50.240 --> 00:03:53.980
he was ready to ditch the aristocratic pretenses forever.

63
00:03:54.160 --> 00:03:58.460
So instead of going to university, he went to Burma for Richard and Ida.

64
00:03:58.461 --> 00:04:03.450
This was a little like her son had ditched a future at Yale to work the deeper

65
00:04:03.770 --> 00:04:08.330
fat fry at a Chick-fil-A joining the colonial service was something Richard had

66
00:04:08.331 --> 00:04:10.810
done out of necessity. Not out of choice,

67
00:04:11.110 --> 00:04:15.290
no graduate of Eden should have been headed to Burma yet come 1922.

68
00:04:15.350 --> 00:04:17.770
That's exactly where or well found himself.

69
00:04:18.030 --> 00:04:21.840
He was a policeman in a colonial occupying a remote part of Asia.

70
00:04:22.140 --> 00:04:24.680
He must have known he would hate it and he did,

71
00:04:24.900 --> 00:04:28.720
but all Well's time in Burer would prove to be more than just an exercise in

72
00:04:28.721 --> 00:04:29.340
masochism.

73
00:04:29.340 --> 00:04:33.520
Rather it would be the place that transformed him from a melancholy school boy

74
00:04:33.830 --> 00:04:35.040
into a melancholy writer.

75
00:04:41.460 --> 00:04:45.310
When he later looked back at his time in Burma Allwell would electronically

76
00:04:45.370 --> 00:04:50.270
report that nearly everyone there hated him after his arrival in 1922

77
00:04:50.290 --> 00:04:54.870
had first tried to play the role of a colonial oppressor only to discover that

78
00:04:54.980 --> 00:04:57.310
lording it over the Burmis made him miserable.

79
00:04:57.570 --> 00:05:00.710
So he began instead to try and befriend the locals,

80
00:05:00.730 --> 00:05:02.580
but while he enjoyed their companies,

81
00:05:02.600 --> 00:05:06.860
the basic fact of his Englishness was a barrier to friendship. As a result,

82
00:05:06.880 --> 00:05:10.980
he lived in a Twilight state ashamed of his work and ashamed of his fellow

83
00:05:11.260 --> 00:05:15.860
colonials, but indelibly associated with them finally in July, 1927,

84
00:05:15.861 --> 00:05:19.860
while on home leave in England or well realized, he just couldn't take any more.

85
00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:21.970
He resigned from the colonial or police,

86
00:05:22.230 --> 00:05:26.570
but rather than Chuck the towel in and go to university or well decided to give

87
00:05:26.571 --> 00:05:30.290
his parents another heart attack, renting a cheap room in east London,

88
00:05:30.650 --> 00:05:34.930
or well dressed himself as a tramp and went off to live among the poorest of the

89
00:05:34.931 --> 00:05:38.370
working classes. He did that on and off for the next four years.

90
00:05:38.800 --> 00:05:42.320
It's been speculated that all was trying to assuage the guilt that he'd felt

91
00:05:42.321 --> 00:05:45.840
from his time in Burer the guilt of being part of a privileged elite,

92
00:05:46.280 --> 00:05:48.040
actively oppressing others, whatever the truth,

93
00:05:48.090 --> 00:05:53.000
right up until 1932 Orwell lived alongside tramps and beggars sometimes

94
00:05:53.230 --> 00:05:57.000
loafing around London, sometimes picking hops in Kent. At some point,

95
00:05:57.140 --> 00:06:00.840
he made his way to Paris where he spent a year and a half in biting poverty,

96
00:06:00.910 --> 00:06:05.440
working irregularly in hotels, in Grimmy restaurants, despite this all well,

97
00:06:05.660 --> 00:06:09.120
wasn't actually poor while he spends a lot of time experiencing poverty.

98
00:06:09.460 --> 00:06:12.000
His life in the slums was not a constant thing.

99
00:06:12.180 --> 00:06:16.360
It spent a few weeks there then returned to his parents home to decompress for a

100
00:06:16.361 --> 00:06:17.950
bit as before starting the cycle.

101
00:06:18.090 --> 00:06:21.190
It was this approach that gave him time to finally start writing.

102
00:06:21.570 --> 00:06:24.790
Not that he crapped out masterpieces from the go though,

103
00:06:25.050 --> 00:06:27.270
or Wells first tales were pretty awful.

104
00:06:27.620 --> 00:06:31.910
Like the sort of pros that instinctively makes literary professors projectile

105
00:06:31.911 --> 00:06:34.230
vomit across the lecture hall. The few writer, friends,

106
00:06:34.390 --> 00:06:37.940
he hadd would actually read his painfully earnest stories together just to make

107
00:06:37.941 --> 00:06:42.220
themselves laugh, but all well stuck with it. From 1928 to 1932,

108
00:06:42.360 --> 00:06:44.660
he worked hard to improve his pros and Intel.

109
00:06:44.820 --> 00:06:48.900
It finally mastered a par down minimalist style, which wasn't Hemingway,

110
00:06:48.920 --> 00:06:53.260
but at least didn't send anyone who read it and just spasms of laughter for his

111
00:06:53.261 --> 00:06:55.940
first book. That was good enough down and out in Paris.

112
00:06:55.941 --> 00:06:58.890
London hit the bookshelves January, 1933,

113
00:06:59.130 --> 00:07:02.970
a lightly fictionalized retelling of all Well's time among the destitute down

114
00:07:03.130 --> 00:07:03.450
and out,

115
00:07:03.450 --> 00:07:07.890
his famous today for its clear eye reporting of life at the bottom in 1933,

116
00:07:07.891 --> 00:07:08.310
though,

117
00:07:08.310 --> 00:07:12.370
it was potentially scandalous so much so that Orwell law in some tellings,

118
00:07:12.371 --> 00:07:15.490
his publisher decided to really sit not under his birth name,

119
00:07:15.930 --> 00:07:16.770
but under a pseudonym.

120
00:07:16.830 --> 00:07:20.720
And so it was that Eric Arthur Blair came to be known to history as George

121
00:07:21.200 --> 00:07:23.920
Orwell, while down now didn't exactly fly off the shelves.

122
00:07:23.921 --> 00:07:25.840
It did earn some stellar reviews.

123
00:07:25.870 --> 00:07:28.840
Good enough that Orwell's publisher asked if he had any more.

124
00:07:29.220 --> 00:07:33.920
We can only hope Orwell responded with a slight smile in his three short decades

125
00:07:34.060 --> 00:07:37.480
on earth. It already amassed enough material to make himself famous.

126
00:07:44.090 --> 00:07:48.230
The next few years saw a stream of books from Allwell all based on his own life

127
00:07:48.340 --> 00:07:50.910
down and out was followed by Burmese days.

128
00:07:50.990 --> 00:07:53.510
Orwell's bitter attack on the colonial system.

129
00:07:53.610 --> 00:07:57.430
But while down and out had been close to rep reportage Burmeses days introduced

130
00:07:57.431 --> 00:08:00.100
one of the key characteristics of, or Wells fiction,

131
00:08:00.460 --> 00:08:05.020
a lonely protagonist trapped in an oppressive system who can't seem to escape no

132
00:08:05.021 --> 00:08:09.220
matter what he does a year after Burmeses days came outta clergy's daughter

133
00:08:09.360 --> 00:08:12.980
landed based on all Well's own experience, working for a cheap private school.

134
00:08:13.050 --> 00:08:14.740
This was followed in 1936,

135
00:08:14.800 --> 00:08:19.340
by keep the ASIST flying a semi Satar of all Wells time living respected,

136
00:08:19.341 --> 00:08:22.610
but on the edges of London's literary scene. Yes,

137
00:08:22.611 --> 00:08:24.170
if this book was slightly tongue in cheek,

138
00:08:24.171 --> 00:08:28.610
it was still haunted by all Well's pet themes of poverty and the dehumanizing

139
00:08:28.660 --> 00:08:30.210
power of social systems,

140
00:08:30.380 --> 00:08:33.690
which is why the same year as bistro was released.

141
00:08:34.290 --> 00:08:35.730
Orwell got the offer of a lifetime.

142
00:08:35.731 --> 00:08:39.690
Victor Gillens was a wealthy left wing publisher who wanted to know if Allwell

143
00:08:39.691 --> 00:08:44.160
would take a commission writing about poverty in England for this glance was

144
00:08:44.161 --> 00:08:48.120
willing to pay 500 pounds to make it a little easier in today's money.

145
00:08:48.230 --> 00:08:52.240
That would be like someone offering you $45,000 for a short book written.

146
00:08:52.241 --> 00:08:57.040
However you saw fit as Orwell probably didn't actually say Keun

147
00:08:57.380 --> 00:08:58.213
for the next two months.

148
00:08:58.640 --> 00:09:01.760
Orwell lived in the north of England among destitute working towns,

149
00:09:01.761 --> 00:09:04.400
gathering material. It was a grim experience,

150
00:09:04.500 --> 00:09:08.880
one comprising Knight of bed pans and bitter cult in Orwell's hands though it

151
00:09:08.881 --> 00:09:13.880
became the road to Wiggen pier Wiggen pier is the book where Orwell famously

152
00:09:13.881 --> 00:09:17.270
proclaimed in so of a socialist believe that he would hold for the rest of his

153
00:09:17.271 --> 00:09:18.020
life. However,

154
00:09:18.020 --> 00:09:22.390
it's also the book where Orwell took other English socialists to task for not

155
00:09:22.391 --> 00:09:23.550
living by their convictions.

156
00:09:23.650 --> 00:09:27.230
Victor Golan was so disappointed that he would only publish it with an

157
00:09:27.231 --> 00:09:29.870
introduction that basically said, don't listen to this guy.

158
00:09:30.180 --> 00:09:34.350
He's a bit of an idiot. Still Orwell got his 500 pounds. And on June the ninth,

159
00:09:34.351 --> 00:09:38.580
he was a able to marry his girlfriend, Eileen Mory.

160
00:09:38.760 --> 00:09:39.593
But while Wiggin,

161
00:09:39.860 --> 00:09:43.620
Pierre may have seemed like the culmination of all Well's life's work events in

162
00:09:43.621 --> 00:09:47.580
Europe were about to send that life careering in a whole new direction.

163
00:09:47.770 --> 00:09:48.940
Back in 1931,

164
00:09:48.941 --> 00:09:53.580
Spain had abolished its monarchy resulting in a new liberal Republic. At first,

165
00:09:53.600 --> 00:09:57.010
the Republican ticked along, but there in 1933,

166
00:09:57.310 --> 00:10:01.890
hardly conservatives had won the elections in the aftermath left-wing cattles

167
00:10:01.891 --> 00:10:06.170
and Barcelona had attempted toed from Spain only to be crushed by general

168
00:10:06.200 --> 00:10:08.890
Francisco Franco while Franco's bloody response,

169
00:10:08.891 --> 00:10:13.370
turned him into a darling of the right. It alienated the electorate so much.

170
00:10:13.470 --> 00:10:18.040
So that conservatives lost power in 1936 to a leftist coalition,

171
00:10:18.560 --> 00:10:18.620
sorry.

172
00:10:18.620 --> 00:10:23.120
Franco decided to just do away with elections altogether on July the 17th,

173
00:10:23.480 --> 00:10:26.480
1936 Franco launched his coup across Spain,

174
00:10:26.760 --> 00:10:29.360
military units rose up to deposed the government.

175
00:10:29.510 --> 00:10:31.320
They were successful in many areas,

176
00:10:31.380 --> 00:10:36.040
but not in all of them in Madrids and Catalonia left wing counters kept the

177
00:10:36.120 --> 00:10:37.230
nationalist bay.

178
00:10:37.510 --> 00:10:41.990
Suddenly one part of Spain was under the control of hard right fascists.

179
00:10:42.130 --> 00:10:45.550
And the other part was under the control of hardcore leftists.

180
00:10:45.850 --> 00:10:48.230
So the two sides did what came naturally.

181
00:10:48.380 --> 00:10:53.150
They executed tens of thousands of subversives in their respective areas.

182
00:10:53.450 --> 00:10:55.790
And then they turned their guns on one another in Britain,

183
00:10:56.010 --> 00:11:00.140
the siren song of the Spanish civil war called thousands of young men to go

184
00:11:00.230 --> 00:11:04.100
fight on the Republican side. On December the 23rd, 1936,

185
00:11:04.240 --> 00:11:07.460
George Orwell joins their number saying goodbye to Eileen.

186
00:11:07.640 --> 00:11:11.380
He stepped aboard a train headed first for the English channel and then to Paris

187
00:11:11.680 --> 00:11:15.260
and then onto Barcelona. By the time he returned his life,

188
00:11:15.261 --> 00:11:18.890
would've changed completely. Now, just before we continue with today's video,

189
00:11:18.970 --> 00:11:21.810
I do want to tell you a bit about today's sponsor Nord VPN,

190
00:11:22.150 --> 00:11:26.330
fairly appropriate for a video made about the man who wrote 1984. Now,

191
00:11:26.331 --> 00:11:30.010
if you are buying things online and using a public wifi, Spotify thing,

192
00:11:30.011 --> 00:11:33.570
coffee shops, airports, cetera, you rarely must be using a VPN.

193
00:11:33.590 --> 00:11:35.250
And that's when Nord VPN comes in.

194
00:11:35.370 --> 00:11:38.640
I know it's tempting not to bother and just rarely are the best,

195
00:11:38.740 --> 00:11:42.600
but those stories you read online about people having their data stolen, people,

196
00:11:42.601 --> 00:11:46.040
breaking into accounts and all of that sort of stuff. It really does happen.

197
00:11:46.380 --> 00:11:48.280
So don't make it easy for people to do that to you.

198
00:11:48.600 --> 00:11:51.960
Whenever I'm browsing on public wifi, I just keep ignored VPN all the time,

199
00:11:51.990 --> 00:11:53.440
just running in the background.

200
00:11:53.700 --> 00:11:55.840
So I don't have to worry about anyone stealing my data,

201
00:11:55.980 --> 00:11:57.320
but it's not all about security.

202
00:11:57.540 --> 00:12:00.560
You can also use it to change the country that you appear to be in.

203
00:12:00.561 --> 00:12:04.360
So you can get content that might normally only be available in specific

204
00:12:04.361 --> 00:12:09.040
geographic locations, nor VPN is super fast. So watching a video is a breeze.

205
00:12:09.041 --> 00:12:13.550
There's no lag whatsoever. If you've ever used VPNs and thought slow, well,

206
00:12:13.810 --> 00:12:17.430
no more with an nod VPN and you can use it on all of your devices. Very easily,

207
00:12:17.580 --> 00:12:19.310
Android Chrome windows, Linux,

208
00:12:19.450 --> 00:12:22.510
and on six devices at the same time with one account.

209
00:12:22.570 --> 00:12:24.950
Now you might have heard about the nod breach in the news,

210
00:12:25.050 --> 00:12:29.230
but it's important to point out that no user information was exposed because nod

211
00:12:29.290 --> 00:12:33.780
VPN doesn't keep any logs on its servers because it doesn't give it any logs at

212
00:12:33.781 --> 00:12:34.614
all. However,

213
00:12:34.700 --> 00:12:38.820
Nord VPN are still taking this very seriously and are moving to a 100% owned

214
00:12:38.821 --> 00:12:41.500
server model. Unlike most other VPNs,

215
00:12:41.510 --> 00:12:45.900
there are also improvements to other aspects of their security taking place.

216
00:12:46.040 --> 00:12:50.620
So start protecting your internet experience today at Nord vpn.com/biographics

217
00:12:50.640 --> 00:12:54.530
use code biographics to get 84% off those two great gifts,

218
00:12:54.760 --> 00:12:59.010
four months of Nord, VPN, and Nord lock for free. Uh, let's go back to it.

219
00:13:05.240 --> 00:13:09.650
It's impossible to overstate both how complicated and how bloody the Spanish

220
00:13:09.651 --> 00:13:12.450
civil war was on the bloody side. Republican mobs,

221
00:13:12.650 --> 00:13:16.640
lynched clergy in the street while nationalists had their female enemies

222
00:13:16.720 --> 00:13:17.680
publicly raped.

223
00:13:18.040 --> 00:13:21.640
Although nominally under Republican control Barcelona was actually home to

224
00:13:21.920 --> 00:13:25.400
multiple leftist factions. Some of whom hated one another's Gus.

225
00:13:25.720 --> 00:13:29.040
They were anarchists cattle and nationalists Trotskyites Stalinists,

226
00:13:29.480 --> 00:13:32.000
not aligns Marxists who viewed everyone with suspicion.

227
00:13:32.130 --> 00:13:34.480
There were soldiers armed by and under the direction,

228
00:13:34.630 --> 00:13:38.190
a USSR while out on the battlefield troops from Nazi Germany,

229
00:13:38.380 --> 00:13:40.390
clandestinely trained Franco's guys,

230
00:13:40.570 --> 00:13:44.150
it was into this tangled web of alliances that oil found himself plunged

231
00:13:44.190 --> 00:13:48.350
headlong in January, 1937. Although nominally there to cover the war.

232
00:13:48.910 --> 00:13:50.750
Orwell lost no time signing up to fight.

233
00:13:50.860 --> 00:13:54.150
Initially he wanted to join the international brigades that communist unit

234
00:13:54.510 --> 00:13:57.660
fighting around the grit, but this proved to be difficult.

235
00:13:57.760 --> 00:13:58.900
So instead he joins poem.

236
00:13:58.950 --> 00:14:02.980
Those non-aligned Marxist that we mentioned a moment ago in practical terms,

237
00:14:03.010 --> 00:14:03.700
this meant,

238
00:14:03.700 --> 00:14:08.020
or well briefly trained in Lenon barracks before being sent out to fights on the

239
00:14:08.340 --> 00:14:10.220
arrogant front. But when we say fighter,

240
00:14:10.360 --> 00:14:13.220
we really mean stand arounds in a trench. Getting really,

241
00:14:13.221 --> 00:14:18.010
really bought arrogant was not action was at all after a couple of months or

242
00:14:18.011 --> 00:14:19.890
well, he was climbing the walls again.

243
00:14:19.891 --> 00:14:22.690
He tried to join the international brigades, but again,

244
00:14:23.070 --> 00:14:26.610
it got him nowhere finally crawling with Aly board out of his mind,

245
00:14:27.050 --> 00:14:30.090
or well returned to Barcelona just in time for the Mayday.

246
00:14:30.390 --> 00:14:33.890
The Maydays were a super complicated power struggle that played out on the

247
00:14:33.891 --> 00:14:38.000
streets of Barcelona between the communis various anarchist factions,

248
00:14:38.280 --> 00:14:41.360
the cattle nationalists and various Marxist groups.

249
00:14:41.660 --> 00:14:44.880
The important thing is that during the fight, the communist went after the poem.

250
00:14:45.190 --> 00:14:46.680
This is how Orwell found himself,

251
00:14:46.780 --> 00:14:50.360
sat on a Barcelona rooftop with a gun defending Palm headquarters.

252
00:14:50.780 --> 00:14:52.360
As the left to devour itself,

253
00:14:52.780 --> 00:14:56.160
all told maybe a thousand people died in five days of street violence,

254
00:14:56.420 --> 00:14:59.640
but it was what came next. That was really shocking in the aftermath.

255
00:14:59.641 --> 00:15:03.520
The communists began a hard propaganda drive against all groups that had opposed

256
00:15:03.521 --> 00:15:06.400
them. Anyone fighting for poem was painted as a fascist,

257
00:15:06.560 --> 00:15:10.750
suddenly joining the international brigades did not seem like the great test

258
00:15:10.940 --> 00:15:14.230
idea. So Allwell went back to the front and there,

259
00:15:14.730 --> 00:15:19.350
his story nearly ended lounging in a trench at Toul allel was shot by a fascist

260
00:15:19.370 --> 00:15:22.190
sniper. The bullet passed through his throat, nearly killing him.

261
00:15:22.210 --> 00:15:25.190
He lost so much blood that his death seemed inevitable.

262
00:15:25.380 --> 00:15:28.350
Just think had that bullet been just a few millimeters over.

263
00:15:28.650 --> 00:15:31.860
We wouldn't be here right now. George L would be a name,

264
00:15:31.960 --> 00:15:36.780
no known to those teaching courses with names like socialist writers of interwar

265
00:15:36.781 --> 00:15:37.270
Britain.

266
00:15:37.270 --> 00:15:41.300
Thankfully though the bullet passed clean through and all well lived taken off

267
00:15:41.301 --> 00:15:43.420
the fronts with permanently damaged vocal chords.

268
00:15:43.421 --> 00:15:45.300
He was returned to Barcelona just in time.

269
00:15:45.301 --> 00:15:48.380
Very thing to go south by the end of may, 1937,

270
00:15:48.381 --> 00:15:50.820
things in the city had reached the point of no return.

271
00:15:50.880 --> 00:15:55.330
The communist were moving against their enemies and the Palm was high on their

272
00:15:55.331 --> 00:15:58.610
list. Still badly wounded or well realized he had no choice,

273
00:15:58.670 --> 00:16:01.250
but to leave right now in the end,

274
00:16:01.390 --> 00:16:05.250
he badly made it as his friends from Palm were assassinated or vanished into

275
00:16:05.260 --> 00:16:06.093
jails or well,

276
00:16:06.170 --> 00:16:09.450
and his wife managed to flee Catalonia for France just ahead of the clamp down.

277
00:16:09.630 --> 00:16:11.810
Had they been just a few hours slower?

278
00:16:12.060 --> 00:16:16.640
It had have been a well goodbye place in history and hello socialist writers of

279
00:16:16.760 --> 00:16:19.840
in war Britain by the end of June, Orwell was back in Britain,

280
00:16:20.190 --> 00:16:22.880
safe from the Inferno engulfing Catalonia,

281
00:16:23.260 --> 00:16:26.680
but his experience in Spain had changed him B he was still a committed

282
00:16:26.681 --> 00:16:30.760
socialist, or had discovered a new abiding hatred for communism.

283
00:16:30.980 --> 00:16:34.310
It would be this hatred that would fuel his two greatest works

284
00:16:40.730 --> 00:16:44.870
On April. The first 1939, Spain fell to Franco's forces, heralding,

285
00:16:45.030 --> 00:16:46.910
a fascist victory for George Orwell.

286
00:16:46.911 --> 00:16:49.670
It was just another piece of bad news in two years,

287
00:16:49.671 --> 00:16:53.540
filled with it on his return from the war or well had written homage to aronia.

288
00:16:53.800 --> 00:16:58.020
Now regarded as one of the best pieces of war reporting ever in 1938, though,

289
00:16:58.160 --> 00:17:02.060
it was seen as a betrayal of the left wing communist leaning audience that had

290
00:17:02.061 --> 00:17:04.740
cultivated over the years, despite greater reviews,

291
00:17:04.760 --> 00:17:08.980
it barely shifted failing to reach even Orwell's normal loads of three to 4,000

292
00:17:09.300 --> 00:17:13.140
copies salt just before its publication or well collapsed with breathing

293
00:17:13.141 --> 00:17:13.670
troubles.

294
00:17:13.670 --> 00:17:17.970
His subsequent diagnosis of tuberculosis only confirms that he was on a downward

295
00:17:17.971 --> 00:17:19.850
trajectory by mid 1939.

296
00:17:20.250 --> 00:17:24.170
Orwell was ill and loved by many of his former readers and deeply pessimistic

297
00:17:24.260 --> 00:17:27.810
about the future of Europe. When war finally broke out on September the third,

298
00:17:27.811 --> 00:17:30.370
it just seemed to confirm his cynicism that fall.

299
00:17:30.470 --> 00:17:34.010
He tried to join up to fight the Nazis, but he was refused because of his tab.

300
00:17:34.740 --> 00:17:38.280
So he joins the home guard half hoping it would become a vehicle for

301
00:17:38.281 --> 00:17:42.120
revolutionary change like Palm. If you've ever watched the TV show, dad Zomi,

302
00:17:42.260 --> 00:17:45.960
you can probably guess how at and out finally, in 1941,

303
00:17:45.961 --> 00:17:47.160
desperate to be of some help.

304
00:17:47.720 --> 00:17:51.440
Orwell joins the BBC producing propaganda for its radio division. Today.

305
00:17:52.040 --> 00:17:53.280
Orwell's time at the BBC is legendary.

306
00:17:53.281 --> 00:17:56.480
Not because of the work he did there almost none of which survives,

307
00:17:56.620 --> 00:18:00.200
but because of the tales, for instance, it said that 1980 fours,

308
00:18:00.201 --> 00:18:05.120
mental torture chamber room 1 0 1 was named for a real room where Orwell had

309
00:18:05.121 --> 00:18:08.080
to sit through endless meetings. That's probably a myth,

310
00:18:08.081 --> 00:18:11.030
but it does show what or well thought of his time there.

311
00:18:11.100 --> 00:18:12.910
When he left in late 1943,

312
00:18:13.050 --> 00:18:16.110
he couldn't wait to see the back of the place by 1944,

313
00:18:16.111 --> 00:18:18.630
both Allwell and Sai were in a very bad place.

314
00:18:19.190 --> 00:18:23.070
Although that recently adopted a boy called Richard both were sick with serious

315
00:18:23.140 --> 00:18:24.470
illnesses. On top of that,

316
00:18:24.670 --> 00:18:28.350
it wasn't a publisher in England willing to take on Orwell's latest novel fable

317
00:18:28.360 --> 00:18:32.060
about who revolt against their owner. And yes, with that,

318
00:18:32.170 --> 00:18:34.220
it's time to talk about animal farm,

319
00:18:34.580 --> 00:18:38.940
a deceptively simple Satter on the Russian revolution and its betrayal by Stalin

320
00:18:38.941 --> 00:18:42.740
animal farm is the first of all Wells two late life masterpieces,

321
00:18:42.880 --> 00:18:44.020
but in 1944,

322
00:18:44.120 --> 00:18:48.540
it was also a potential embarrassment Stalin's USS saw was an ally not wanting

323
00:18:48.541 --> 00:18:51.570
to hurt the war effort. No one wanted to touch the book.

324
00:18:51.580 --> 00:18:54.250
Eventually Orwell managed to find an American publisher,

325
00:18:54.251 --> 00:18:58.050
willing to take a chance provided that they could wait until world Wari was over

326
00:18:58.810 --> 00:19:03.490
Orwell agreed. And on August the 17th, 1945 animal farm hit the shelves.

327
00:19:03.750 --> 00:19:06.130
It was an instant and colossal smash.

328
00:19:06.690 --> 00:19:09.810
Remember when we told you Orwell's novels usually sold 4,000 copies,

329
00:19:10.040 --> 00:19:14.800
each animal farm sold over a quarter million in its first year

330
00:19:14.930 --> 00:19:16.240
alone. For some reason,

331
00:19:16.420 --> 00:19:19.440
the fable struck a chord with readers in a way more complex,

332
00:19:19.800 --> 00:19:23.040
fair like homage to Catalonia, never did. Maybe it was the timing.

333
00:19:23.210 --> 00:19:26.920
Maybe it was the endless quoteability like the moments the pigs pronounce,

334
00:19:26.980 --> 00:19:31.110
all animals are equal, but some animals are more equal than others. Well,

335
00:19:31.111 --> 00:19:31.751
for whatever reason,

336
00:19:31.751 --> 00:19:35.830
animal farm was the hit or well dreamed of writing the money poured in.

337
00:19:35.831 --> 00:19:36.710
He became famous.

338
00:19:36.850 --> 00:19:40.350
The CIA even contacted him for permission to translate his book to Russian and

339
00:19:40.380 --> 00:19:44.790
smuggle it into the Soviet union. Yet Orwell felt no joy at any of this.

340
00:19:44.940 --> 00:19:49.070
Just five months before animal farms release Eileen had died of cancer while

341
00:19:49.590 --> 00:19:53.860
Orwell was away on a newspaper assignment outwardly or well Bo her death with

342
00:19:54.020 --> 00:19:58.300
stoicism. But inside, inside, he was a mess and angry,

343
00:19:59.020 --> 00:20:02.860
guilty, bitter mess. Early next year, he took his adopted son,

344
00:20:02.861 --> 00:20:05.180
Richard and left London for good by now,

345
00:20:05.181 --> 00:20:09.500
his tuberculosis was nearly terminal as man and boy headed to the remote islands

346
00:20:09.501 --> 00:20:10.040
of Scotland.

347
00:20:10.040 --> 00:20:14.290
It must have seems like well was shortly going to go the same way as Eileen,

348
00:20:14.830 --> 00:20:18.490
but not quite yet. Allwell still had one last book in him.

349
00:20:18.630 --> 00:20:22.090
And it was this final book written as he drifted towards death's doorway.

350
00:20:22.440 --> 00:20:23.690
That would change the world.

351
00:20:30.310 --> 00:20:33.080
If you look up the definition of remote in the dictionary,

352
00:20:33.081 --> 00:20:36.840
you'll find a picture of Jah islands. Actually that's a lie.

353
00:20:36.841 --> 00:20:41.440
We just wanted a more interesting way of saying JIRA is pretty remote without

354
00:20:41.630 --> 00:20:44.400
just saying JIRA is pretty remote,

355
00:20:44.700 --> 00:20:49.360
but JIRA is remote and the house Allwell and Richard moved into was remote.

356
00:20:49.510 --> 00:20:52.880
Even for JIRA, it was eight miles from the nearest phone,

357
00:20:52.940 --> 00:20:57.440
25 miles from the nearest village to get from there to London would take over

358
00:20:57.580 --> 00:21:00.560
two days. Naturally. Allwell loved it for years.

359
00:21:01.000 --> 00:21:02.800
It'd been turning a story over in his head,

360
00:21:02.880 --> 00:21:07.070
a dystopian sci-fi fantasy that would mix together his thoughts on communism.

361
00:21:07.140 --> 00:21:11.710
What had seen in Catalonia and totalitarianism generally now that he was

362
00:21:11.711 --> 00:21:14.190
effectively alone, amid jurors, bleak wilderness.

363
00:21:14.290 --> 00:21:18.030
He could devote himself to the book entirely for the next few months.

364
00:21:18.350 --> 00:21:21.230
All well worked. 10 hour days hunched over a small desk chain,

365
00:21:21.550 --> 00:21:24.670
smoking cigarettes and working on his novel by February, 1948.

366
00:21:24.670 --> 00:21:26.350
He had a first draft famously.

367
00:21:26.351 --> 00:21:30.740
He swapped last two digits of the date to make the title. 1984,

368
00:21:31.180 --> 00:21:34.300
that done. He promptly collapsed and nearly died of tuberculosis.

369
00:21:34.520 --> 00:21:35.353
Rushed to the hospital.

370
00:21:35.820 --> 00:21:38.300
Allwell was forced to undergo brutal treatments just to survive.

371
00:21:38.400 --> 00:21:42.100
He had air injected directly into his lungs was given experimental medicines

372
00:21:42.101 --> 00:21:45.180
that caused an allergic reaction that nearly killed him desperate to get his

373
00:21:45.181 --> 00:21:46.740
last novel out. Before he kicked the bucket,

374
00:21:46.960 --> 00:21:50.530
he tried to hire a typist to take dictation when no one responded.

375
00:21:50.531 --> 00:21:54.650
He simply sat in bed getting weaker and weaker as he typed away.

376
00:21:54.790 --> 00:21:56.890
By the end of the year, he was back on juror again,

377
00:21:56.980 --> 00:22:01.410
where he finished the second draft almost immediately. He collapsed again.

378
00:22:01.560 --> 00:22:02.393
From that point on,

379
00:22:02.470 --> 00:22:06.850
he spent most of what remained of his life in sanatoriums by January, 1949.

380
00:22:07.250 --> 00:22:09.480
Orwell was barely clinging to the world of the living.

381
00:22:09.740 --> 00:22:14.360
The effort of hanging in there itself almost killing him. Yes. Hang on.

382
00:22:14.361 --> 00:22:16.760
He did until June the eighth, 1949,

383
00:22:17.030 --> 00:22:20.720
when 1984 was finally published almost immediately,

384
00:22:20.820 --> 00:22:24.600
the fight began over what it meant for some the novels vision of Britain under a

385
00:22:24.601 --> 00:22:28.360
sta dictatorship that watches people's every move and police,

386
00:22:28.550 --> 00:22:32.910
their thoughts represented Orwell's final break with the left for others.

387
00:22:33.210 --> 00:22:35.790
It was another Satir of the USS arm. This time.

388
00:22:36.070 --> 00:22:40.270
One with far darker undertones than animal farm others saw in it's a veiled

389
00:22:40.271 --> 00:22:44.550
attack on the Catholic church's role in the inquisition while yet others thought

390
00:22:44.551 --> 00:22:47.030
it was an allegory for the post world war II order,

391
00:22:47.080 --> 00:22:50.060
where conferences at Y had carved up the globe.

392
00:22:50.320 --> 00:22:54.820
But that's part of the genius of 1984. It can be reinterpreted in so many ways,

393
00:22:55.170 --> 00:22:59.340
free market, libertarian, committed anarchist and anti Stalin, communist,

394
00:22:59.341 --> 00:23:03.900
and an old stuffy British conservative could all claim it as their own. Sadly,

395
00:23:03.930 --> 00:23:07.460
none of them had a chance to ask if they were right on January the 21st,

396
00:23:07.700 --> 00:23:11.730
1950 George Orwell died of his tuberculosis age, just 46,

397
00:23:11.870 --> 00:23:14.850
barely three months before they had married. Richard's old babysitter,

398
00:23:15.330 --> 00:23:18.210
Sonya the model for Julia in 19 84,

399
00:23:18.210 --> 00:23:21.170
1 of O Well's last act was to ask for a Christian burial,

400
00:23:21.570 --> 00:23:22.970
although he was a lifelong atheist,

401
00:23:23.030 --> 00:23:26.570
it seems he just couldn't refuse a traditional goodbye.

402
00:23:26.870 --> 00:23:30.680
Not that it seems Western culture will ever truly say good by it or all.

403
00:23:30.840 --> 00:23:34.720
Well in the decade after A's death, Sonya Allwell methodically republished,

404
00:23:34.740 --> 00:23:38.760
his old and out of print works. Thanks to animal farms, mega popularity.

405
00:23:38.761 --> 00:23:40.760
People were now ready to read, forgotten gems,

406
00:23:40.761 --> 00:23:45.440
like coming up for air or essays like a hanging or shooting an elephant by

407
00:23:45.640 --> 00:23:49.240
1960 Orwell status as a literary icon was cemented in Britain.

408
00:23:49.370 --> 00:23:52.440
There were animated films of animal farm in the 1970s,

409
00:23:52.441 --> 00:23:56.480
David Bowie first tried to produce a glam rock musical and then released a

410
00:23:56.481 --> 00:23:59.640
concept album based on 1984 come the actual year,

411
00:23:59.960 --> 00:24:04.120
1984 Orwell's work was so well known that it triggered a 12 month media

412
00:24:05.000 --> 00:24:08.350
today. George Awell is a bonafide literary superstar,

413
00:24:08.590 --> 00:24:11.990
a novelist whose name is as recognizable as that of Hemingway.

414
00:24:12.130 --> 00:24:15.230
But even after all this time, the man himself remains a mystery.

415
00:24:15.370 --> 00:24:17.270
As we stated in our opening, oh,

416
00:24:17.271 --> 00:24:21.190
well it was a man of many contradictions and inte that refused to be classified,

417
00:24:21.500 --> 00:24:24.030
just type or well into Google's news tab.

418
00:24:24.031 --> 00:24:26.420
And you'll find a left and right wing writers,

419
00:24:26.610 --> 00:24:30.180
both using his name to decry their opponents, remainers,

420
00:24:30.360 --> 00:24:34.540
and Brexiters capitalists and socialists, everyone and his dog.

421
00:24:34.810 --> 00:24:37.860
They're all convinced that they've got all well SUT,

422
00:24:38.000 --> 00:24:42.020
but to assume you can just star all well into a box and label him misses the

423
00:24:42.021 --> 00:24:45.260
point all his life, all well made a virtue of speaking his mind,

424
00:24:45.530 --> 00:24:48.010
even if it meant biting the hands that fed him,

425
00:24:48.320 --> 00:24:51.290
even if it meant playing devil's advocate in the ends,

426
00:24:51.291 --> 00:24:54.530
we shouldn't think of Allwell as something as simplistic as a left wing writer,

427
00:24:54.810 --> 00:24:56.050
R right wing writer.

428
00:24:56.200 --> 00:25:00.490
Perhaps we should just think of him as a writer who tried to tackle hypocrisy

429
00:25:00.690 --> 00:25:04.930
wherever he saw. It never compromising in his vision of a pH society.

430
00:25:05.530 --> 00:25:07.320
You may have only let after may 46 years,

431
00:25:07.380 --> 00:25:11.800
but in his short time on earth or well managed to create complex masterpieces

432
00:25:11.990 --> 00:25:15.960
that define interpretation come 20, 84 or even 2184.

433
00:25:16.220 --> 00:25:18.720
It seems likely that we'll still be reading them.
