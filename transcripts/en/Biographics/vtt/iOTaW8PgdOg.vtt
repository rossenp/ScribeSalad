18
00:00:59.680 --> 00:01:03.290
<v 0>Before Marilyn Monroe and Jane Mansfield, there was Jean har.</v>

19
00:01:03.470 --> 00:01:05.730
She was one of Hollywood's earliest sex symbols,

20
00:01:05.731 --> 00:01:09.570
whose image revolved around her luscious curls with a unique color that under

21
00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:12.210
the Monica, the platinum blonde inate her,

22
00:01:12.211 --> 00:01:16.610
the envy of women all across the nation who tried and failed to achieve the same

23
00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:18.850
locks of hair. Her Luke brought her success,

24
00:01:18.851 --> 00:01:22.760
but it came with a heavy price as the same beauty regimen that trans formed Jean

25
00:01:23.120 --> 00:01:28.080
Harlow into a household name was also slowly but surely poisoning her inevitably

26
00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:31.360
Harlow fell into one of the many pitfalls of Hollywood and died at a young age,

27
00:01:31.361 --> 00:01:34.200
after a prolonged suffering. She became a caution tale.

28
00:01:34.201 --> 00:01:35.600
Another one of tinsel towns,

29
00:01:35.601 --> 00:01:38.480
tragic stories in an industry that is filled with them even.

30
00:01:38.540 --> 00:01:42.160
So Jean Harlow's legacy goes beyond the mistakes and vices.

31
00:01:42.161 --> 00:01:44.750
She in pursuit of fame and fortune,

32
00:01:45.130 --> 00:01:47.270
and today we will examine it close up.

33
00:01:47.290 --> 00:01:51.030
As we take a look at the life and career of gene Harlow,

34
00:01:51.410 --> 00:01:53.150
the original blonde bombshell

35
00:01:59.430 --> 00:02:03.420
Gene Harlow was born Harlene carpenter on the 3rd of March, 1911 in Kansas city,

36
00:02:03.660 --> 00:02:07.060
Missouri, she was born into a wealthy but unhappy family. Her father,

37
00:02:07.540 --> 00:02:11.460
Montclair carpenter was a dentist with a thriving practice while her mother Jean

38
00:02:11.860 --> 00:02:15.340
Poe carpenter was the daughter of a successful real estate agent named Samuel

39
00:02:15.860 --> 00:02:18.780
Harlow. Later when Jean Harlow became a star using her mother's maiden name,

40
00:02:19.100 --> 00:02:22.660
Jean Poe carpenter went by mother Jean in order to set us off apart.

41
00:02:22.800 --> 00:02:26.330
But we to call her that from the beginning, just to avoid any confusion.

42
00:02:26.730 --> 00:02:29.170
Young Harlene spent the first 10 years of her life in Kansas city,

43
00:02:29.770 --> 00:02:33.330
enrolling at Ms. Barstow's finishing school for girls when she was five in 1921.

44
00:02:33.331 --> 00:02:33.531
However,

45
00:02:33.531 --> 00:02:37.130
mother Jean divorced her husbands and one saw custody of Harlene and promptly

46
00:02:37.131 --> 00:02:38.930
left Missouri in her early thirties. Mother,

47
00:02:39.130 --> 00:02:41.050
Jean still saw herself as young and beautiful,

48
00:02:41.051 --> 00:02:43.930
and she had dreamt of becoming an actress ever since she was a child.

49
00:02:44.220 --> 00:02:45.960
She took her daughter and traveled to Los Angeles,

50
00:02:46.060 --> 00:02:49.800
hoping to make it big but soon found out just how cruel Hollywood could be.

51
00:02:50.080 --> 00:02:52.400
Although she was young, she was not. Moviestar young.

52
00:02:52.420 --> 00:02:55.600
As studios were only interested in women in their early twenties or younger.

53
00:02:55.820 --> 00:02:59.840
So the mother and daughter relocated again this time to Illinois in Chicago,

54
00:02:59.841 --> 00:03:03.480
mother, Jean married her second husband, a man named Marino Bello.

55
00:03:03.880 --> 00:03:05.320
That's for Harlene. She fell in love with a boy,

56
00:03:05.440 --> 00:03:09.480
a few years older than her name's Charles char McGoo their relationship soon

57
00:03:09.481 --> 00:03:12.560
turned serious. And the couple eloped in September, 1927,

58
00:03:12.561 --> 00:03:15.640
when Harlene was 16 years old, Charles McGoo was a trust fund baby.

59
00:03:15.641 --> 00:03:19.470
And once he turned 21, he received his first check, the UN born now wealthy.

60
00:03:19.471 --> 00:03:20.510
They didn't need to work.

61
00:03:20.530 --> 00:03:23.670
So instead they moved to Los Angeles and bought a nice house in Beverly Hills,

62
00:03:23.671 --> 00:03:26.590
where they quickly developed a reputation for being a party couple who often

63
00:03:26.591 --> 00:03:29.950
hosted luncheon barbecues and other social gatherings. At this time,

64
00:03:30.020 --> 00:03:33.630
Harlene still had no grand ambitions about becoming an actress. Her far end,

65
00:03:33.670 --> 00:03:36.550
a Hollywood was mostly happen star during her party.

66
00:03:36.690 --> 00:03:39.460
She befriended an aspiring actress named Rosa Roy.

67
00:03:39.620 --> 00:03:42.620
And one day she gave Rosalie a ride to the Fox studios.

68
00:03:42.780 --> 00:03:46.660
Lot for an audition while waiting Harlene was approached by a few studio execs

69
00:03:46.661 --> 00:03:48.140
who immediately noticed the young,

70
00:03:48.141 --> 00:03:51.580
beautiful blondes and were very surprised to find out that she wasn't an actress

71
00:03:51.850 --> 00:03:54.220
even. So they told her that she had the look for it,

72
00:03:54.240 --> 00:03:57.300
and they gave her a letter of introduction for central casting.

73
00:03:57.320 --> 00:04:00.930
In case she wanted to try a hand at doing some work as an extra. Initially,

74
00:04:00.990 --> 00:04:04.690
she had no intention of going there, but was goed into doing it by Rosalie.

75
00:04:04.691 --> 00:04:07.330
When she signed up, she didn't want to use her real name.

76
00:04:07.331 --> 00:04:10.370
So instead she wrote down her mother's maiden name, Jean Harlow,

77
00:04:16.370 --> 00:04:17.490
Speaking of mother, Jean,

78
00:04:17.810 --> 00:04:19.850
although her daughter had eloped and moved to another city,

79
00:04:20.240 --> 00:04:21.080
two of them were still close.

80
00:04:21.270 --> 00:04:24.680
When she found out about Jean being discovered by movie execs,

81
00:04:24.681 --> 00:04:28.080
she realized that she could live our Hollywood fantasy vicariously through her

82
00:04:28.200 --> 00:04:31.360
daughter. She also encouraged Jean to accept work as an extra,

83
00:04:31.361 --> 00:04:34.600
eventually moving to Los Angeles herself in order to manage her daughter's

84
00:04:35.080 --> 00:04:36.280
burdening career. In 1928,

85
00:04:36.440 --> 00:04:40.480
Jean hollow appeared in her first movie as an uncredited, extra drama by our,

86
00:04:40.790 --> 00:04:44.030
for any green titled on a bound, a few more bit parts followed.

87
00:04:44.170 --> 00:04:48.270
And they were enough to impress the executives at how Roach studios who offered

88
00:04:48.271 --> 00:04:49.990
Gina contract. In 1929,

89
00:04:50.230 --> 00:04:52.830
she started having small roles in some of the studios made money makers,

90
00:04:52.831 --> 00:04:53.910
including comedy short,

91
00:04:53.911 --> 00:04:58.310
starring Charlie chase and Lauren LA Hardy in the movie bacon grabbers Jean even

92
00:04:58.311 --> 00:05:00.990
received her first co-starring credit as Mrs. Kennedy.

93
00:05:01.190 --> 00:05:04.620
After previously only appearing in unnamed or unaccredited roles,

94
00:05:04.800 --> 00:05:07.020
it seems like Jean Harlow's star was on the rise,

95
00:05:07.120 --> 00:05:08.820
but things were not going well at home.

96
00:05:08.920 --> 00:05:12.260
Her husband's truck McGoo was not thrilled with his wife's new career and he

97
00:05:12.261 --> 00:05:13.180
wanted her to quit acting.

98
00:05:13.400 --> 00:05:17.100
She actually relented at first and pleaded with the studio to release her from a

99
00:05:17.340 --> 00:05:20.340
contract. They agreed to do this around the time that Jean turned 18 years old,

100
00:05:20.600 --> 00:05:23.090
but just a few months later, her, she left her husband. Anyway,

101
00:05:23.091 --> 00:05:26.450
presumably this was the work of mother Jean who persuaded her daughter to choose

102
00:05:26.530 --> 00:05:29.930
a career in Hollywood over a marriage. Soon after leaving grew,

103
00:05:30.170 --> 00:05:31.730
Jean hollow began appearing in movies. Again,

104
00:05:31.790 --> 00:05:34.890
her first speaking role came in the 1929 Clara bow feature.

105
00:05:35.150 --> 00:05:38.330
The Saturday night kid into a big break was just around the corner.

106
00:05:38.560 --> 00:05:40.770
This period represented a turning point for Hollywood.

107
00:05:40.770 --> 00:05:44.560
Thanks to the arrival of San. Oh yes, they have it all answer. The movement.

108
00:05:45.040 --> 00:05:48.000
Silent films were slowly being faded out in favor of talkies.

109
00:05:48.020 --> 00:05:52.000
And many actors of the silent era also found their careers waning as directors

110
00:05:52.120 --> 00:05:55.600
and movie producers felt that their voices did not have the same star quality

111
00:05:55.870 --> 00:05:56.960
that matched their looks.

112
00:05:57.300 --> 00:06:01.160
One actress in the situation was Greta Nien born and raised in Norway.

113
00:06:01.161 --> 00:06:04.160
She had a heavy Ning accent, which up until their point had not been a problem.

114
00:06:04.161 --> 00:06:08.400
However, in 1928, she signed onto star and Howard Hughes's epic war film,

115
00:06:08.610 --> 00:06:09.401
Hells angels.

116
00:06:09.401 --> 00:06:12.560
This was an incredibly ambitious and expensive production for the time.

117
00:06:12.620 --> 00:06:17.550
One that employed 20,000 extras and used over 2.2 million feet of

118
00:06:17.551 --> 00:06:20.750
film as a successful entrepreneur and pioneering aviator himself.

119
00:06:20.751 --> 00:06:23.270
Howard Hughes was nothing if not a risk taker.

120
00:06:23.271 --> 00:06:26.590
So he wanted to incorporate all the latest filming techniques available at the

121
00:06:26.591 --> 00:06:26.730
time.

122
00:06:26.730 --> 00:06:30.670
Almost half of the film was shown in tinted colors while one particular scene in

123
00:06:30.671 --> 00:06:33.870
a ballroom used an even more advanced two color technical process.

124
00:06:34.220 --> 00:06:37.340
Then in 1929, even though filming was mostly finished,

125
00:06:37.400 --> 00:06:40.940
Hughes decided that he wanted to transform hell's angels from a silent film,

126
00:06:41.210 --> 00:06:43.980
into a talkie and a reshoot. All of the scenes with dialogue.

127
00:06:44.210 --> 00:06:46.900
This created a problem with the leading lady, as we mentioned,

128
00:06:47.020 --> 00:06:48.740
GRE had a sick Norwegian accent,

129
00:06:48.800 --> 00:06:51.420
but she was supposed to portray a British Aris Tora.

130
00:06:51.421 --> 00:06:54.900
Eventually Hughes dismissed her from the role and the search began for a new

131
00:06:54.901 --> 00:06:58.610
actress. How exactly Hughes found out about gene remains uncertain.

132
00:06:58.890 --> 00:07:01.810
Although most stories say that it was his leading man, Ben Leon,

133
00:07:01.870 --> 00:07:05.610
who suggested her for the role Hughes gave her the part and Jean Harlow is now

134
00:07:05.611 --> 00:07:10.330
finally set on her path to stardom hell's angels premiers on may the 27th,

135
00:07:10.610 --> 00:07:12.770
1930 at grins Chinese theater in Hollywood.

136
00:07:12.790 --> 00:07:16.170
It was a hit and it received praise from everyone for its flying scenes,

137
00:07:16.310 --> 00:07:17.890
but HARs acting didn.

138
00:07:18.200 --> 00:07:21.440
He win anyone over one newspaper even described her as plain awful.

139
00:07:21.590 --> 00:07:23.240
This was not a particular surprise.

140
00:07:23.300 --> 00:07:26.440
She was still only 18 when she shot her scenes and never had any formal

141
00:07:26.720 --> 00:07:29.760
training, even. So it wasn't her acting pros that lured in the audience.

142
00:07:29.790 --> 00:07:34.120
This was Preco Hollywood and movies that plenty of sexual contents as

143
00:07:34.600 --> 00:07:37.800
evidenced by the promotional photograph used to market the movie featuring

144
00:07:38.280 --> 00:07:41.950
Harlow and Ben Leon, even the poster of the movie gave the unknown gene Harlow,

145
00:07:42.010 --> 00:07:46.310
top billing as Hughes knew that a sexy seductive starlet would attract more

146
00:07:46.311 --> 00:07:49.630
attention at the very least hollows were all allowed her to imortalize herself

147
00:07:49.631 --> 00:07:52.830
in the ans of cinema with a memorable line that has been adapted and repeated

148
00:07:52.831 --> 00:07:53.664
countless times.

149
00:07:53.750 --> 00:07:57.270
Although most people probably don't know where it originally came from when she

150
00:07:57.300 --> 00:07:58.790
asks one of her male co-leads.

151
00:07:59.550 --> 00:08:02.180
<v 2>Would you be shocked if I put on something more comfortable.</v>

152
00:08:08.290 --> 00:08:10.140
<v 0>Despite the success of hell's angels,</v>

153
00:08:10.141 --> 00:08:13.460
Howard Hughes had no immediate plans to use gene Harlow in another movies.

154
00:08:13.461 --> 00:08:15.860
So he loaned around to other studios to keep her in the spotlight.

155
00:08:16.330 --> 00:08:18.220
Back then during the studio system days,

156
00:08:18.221 --> 00:08:20.970
actors could not cherry only the roles they wanted to.

157
00:08:21.080 --> 00:08:24.610
They usually signed a long term contract with a specific movie studio in

158
00:08:24.810 --> 00:08:28.650
exchange for a weekly salary. And the execs decided what films they would make.

159
00:08:29.090 --> 00:08:32.010
1931 was a great year for hollow as she Stard in popular movies,

160
00:08:32.011 --> 00:08:35.690
such as the secret six with Clark Gable and the public enemy with James Cagney.

161
00:08:35.691 --> 00:08:36.524
Meanwhile,

162
00:08:36.570 --> 00:08:39.850
Hughes put the might of his marketing department behind Harlow intending to turn

163
00:08:40.010 --> 00:08:43.280
her are into a household name, rival studio paramount at Clara bow,

164
00:08:43.380 --> 00:08:48.040
who was known as the it girl United artists at Mary Pickford, AKA America,

165
00:08:48.360 --> 00:08:52.920
sweet art Hughes decided that Harlow also needed a Mo some ideas such as the

166
00:08:53.320 --> 00:08:57.080
blondes landslide and the darling cyclone were dismissed. Allegedly.

167
00:08:57.081 --> 00:08:59.880
It was Hughes's publicity director who came up with the winning answer,

168
00:09:00.340 --> 00:09:04.080
the platinum blonde after all it was Harlow's stunning golden locks that

169
00:09:04.081 --> 00:09:07.960
immediately drew the attention of the viewer. Much more than acting Hughes,

170
00:09:07.961 --> 00:09:09.360
even launched a national contest,

171
00:09:09.361 --> 00:09:13.320
offering a prize of $10,000 to any stylist who could match the color of a hair.

172
00:09:13.340 --> 00:09:14.440
Nobody ever claimed.

173
00:09:14.990 --> 00:09:17.950
Although this might be because no other stylist would have thought to subject

174
00:09:17.951 --> 00:09:20.910
their clients, the kind of treatment that Harlow was receiving.

175
00:09:21.290 --> 00:09:22.470
But more on that later,

176
00:09:22.730 --> 00:09:25.830
the point is that the name was a hit with the public and one of Harlow's movies

177
00:09:25.831 --> 00:09:26.710
from 1931,

178
00:09:26.711 --> 00:09:30.470
even at its title changed to platinum blondes to fully capitalize on the

179
00:09:30.471 --> 00:09:32.670
popularity of the nickname. Harlow's other well known.

180
00:09:32.671 --> 00:09:37.020
Monica came in 1933 when she starred in comedy bombshell from then on,

181
00:09:37.040 --> 00:09:40.220
she became known as the blonde bombshell and in 1942,

182
00:09:40.221 --> 00:09:43.340
the word bombshell was amended in the Oxford English dictionary to include the

183
00:09:43.341 --> 00:09:47.140
meaning of a pretty woman of startling vitality or physique.

184
00:09:47.460 --> 00:09:50.900
Although her career was flourishing Hollow's personal life was not doing so well

185
00:09:51.110 --> 00:09:53.860
while working on hell's angels. She met producer Paul burn,

186
00:09:53.960 --> 00:09:56.170
who turned into one of her biggest support backstage.

187
00:09:56.270 --> 00:09:59.930
The two first became friends then started dating and finally married in July of

188
00:10:00.130 --> 00:10:01.530
1932, just two months later,

189
00:10:02.050 --> 00:10:04.370
burn was found dead of a gunshot wounds in his house.

190
00:10:04.430 --> 00:10:08.170
And the exact circumstances behind his death are still a mystery to this date.

191
00:10:08.171 --> 00:10:11.450
Officially, it was quickly ruled a suicide since there was a note left behind,

192
00:10:11.451 --> 00:10:14.890
which said, dear is dear. Unfortunately, this is the only way to make good,

193
00:10:14.891 --> 00:10:19.160
the frightful wrong. I have done you. And to wipe out my object humiliation.

194
00:10:19.640 --> 00:10:24.280
I love you, Paul. You understand that last night was only a comedy. However,

195
00:10:24.281 --> 00:10:25.060
decades later,

196
00:10:25.060 --> 00:10:29.360
the investigation was criticized for being haphazard and whitewashed and tainted

197
00:10:29.361 --> 00:10:30.320
by studio interference,

198
00:10:30.330 --> 00:10:33.560
which was done in order to protect gene Harlow's image rather than to find the

199
00:10:33.561 --> 00:10:35.800
truth behind Paul Burn's death later off,

200
00:10:35.960 --> 00:10:39.910
as even claimed that the studio execs led by Lewis B mayor were the first on the

201
00:10:39.911 --> 00:10:42.510
scene before the police and that the officers were okay with this.

202
00:10:42.510 --> 00:10:46.230
Since many of them were being paid off by studio fixers in order to look the

203
00:10:46.231 --> 00:10:46.551
other way,

204
00:10:46.551 --> 00:10:49.590
when it came to crimes that might tarnish the reputations of the stars,

205
00:10:49.740 --> 00:10:53.030
allegedly Mayer even wanted to destroy the note, but was persuaded to leave it.

206
00:10:53.031 --> 00:10:53.950
So that burns death,

207
00:10:54.150 --> 00:10:57.700
that like a suicide caused by his inability to fulfill his marital obligations,

208
00:10:58.360 --> 00:11:00.780
AKA impotence, for all we know this could have been the truth,

209
00:11:00.781 --> 00:11:04.300
but it's impossible to tell since the execs could have altered the crime scene.

210
00:11:04.320 --> 00:11:07.620
In other ways that we don't know about one theory that has gained attention over

211
00:11:07.621 --> 00:11:08.181
the last decades,

212
00:11:08.181 --> 00:11:12.980
pointed the finger as a woman named Dorothy millet burns former common law wife.

213
00:11:12.981 --> 00:11:15.460
Technically the two were still married. Although burn left her.

214
00:11:15.461 --> 00:11:18.330
When she checked herself into a Sanitarium, once she was out burn,

215
00:11:18.331 --> 00:11:20.930
started corresponding with her and sent her money every month.

216
00:11:21.490 --> 00:11:24.890
Millet committed suicide just a few days after Burn's death and rumors started

217
00:11:24.891 --> 00:11:26.450
appearing that she may have been involved.

218
00:11:26.451 --> 00:11:30.370
Somehow these were never substantiated that the tale of the SCO former lover was

219
00:11:30.371 --> 00:11:33.490
just too obvious, a scenario to ignore as for Jean Harlow,

220
00:11:33.590 --> 00:11:36.210
she was not home when be died during the investigation.

221
00:11:36.470 --> 00:11:40.000
She only said that she knew not nothing and refuse to discuss the matter in

222
00:11:40.001 --> 00:11:43.520
public for the rest of our life. Most likely at the insistence of the studio,

223
00:11:50.030 --> 00:11:53.120
Even though Howard Hughes invested heavily in promoting gene Harlow as the

224
00:11:53.200 --> 00:11:57.000
platinum blonds, he sold her contracts in 1932 to MGM.

225
00:11:57.001 --> 00:12:00.880
This was when Paul burn was still alive as he was an executive at MGM and

226
00:12:01.000 --> 00:12:03.480
persuaded the higher ups that she'd make a good investments.

227
00:12:03.840 --> 00:12:06.880
Jean Harlow's first movie with MGM was called redheaded woman comedy that

228
00:12:06.881 --> 00:12:10.680
received critical acclaim was one of the few roles that garner Harlow praise for

229
00:12:10.740 --> 00:12:13.910
her acting. It also had a lot of risk gay content for that time,

230
00:12:13.911 --> 00:12:16.470
such as affairs, premarital sex, and attempted murder.

231
00:12:16.610 --> 00:12:20.390
But the most surprising thing about it was that the actress didn't make use of

232
00:12:20.391 --> 00:12:22.070
her signature platinum Blon curl.

233
00:12:22.080 --> 00:12:25.670
Since that the title implies the lead character was a redhead.

234
00:12:25.990 --> 00:12:28.710
Although her character dies her hair in the first scene of the movie in real

235
00:12:28.711 --> 00:12:31.030
life, Jean Harlow wore a wig afterwards.

236
00:12:31.031 --> 00:12:34.540
The actress returned to our trademark Luke in a string of movies with varying

237
00:12:34.541 --> 00:12:38.100
degrees of success hits included the a mentioned bombshell and the romantic

238
00:12:38.200 --> 00:12:42.100
dramas red dust and hold your man who actually starred alongside Clark Gable.

239
00:12:42.120 --> 00:12:46.340
Her most frequent onscreen partner Harlow could not find the same success in a

240
00:12:46.500 --> 00:12:47.141
personal life though.

241
00:12:47.141 --> 00:12:51.700
In 1933 came the third husband a cinematographer named how Rosson,

242
00:12:51.720 --> 00:12:54.450
who had previously worked with the us on several movies.

243
00:12:54.470 --> 00:12:57.930
It had often been reported that this marriage had been arranged by MGM to

244
00:12:57.931 --> 00:13:00.410
protect Harley's reputation prior to our relationship with Ross.

245
00:13:00.610 --> 00:13:03.970
And she had been engaged in a romantic twist with boxer max bear,

246
00:13:04.070 --> 00:13:07.210
who at the time was separated, but not divorced from his wife, actress,

247
00:13:07.360 --> 00:13:10.530
Dorothy Dunbar, not only was this affair pretty well known in Hollywood,

248
00:13:10.531 --> 00:13:14.240
but Dunbar also threatened to name Jean Harley in her divorce proceedings for

249
00:13:14.241 --> 00:13:15.560
engaging in adultery with her husband.

250
00:13:15.690 --> 00:13:18.880
Eventually the studio stepped in and insisted not only that hollow enter

251
00:13:18.881 --> 00:13:19.720
flinging with bear,

252
00:13:19.820 --> 00:13:23.120
but that she enter into a more appropriate relationship with the sake of a

253
00:13:23.121 --> 00:13:24.680
public image. Unsurprisingly,

254
00:13:24.700 --> 00:13:28.360
her marriage with Rosson was short and Loveless a few weeks after the wedding

255
00:13:28.680 --> 00:13:31.360
hollow was rushed the hospital for an emergency appendectomy afterwards,

256
00:13:31.361 --> 00:13:32.320
instead of returning home,

257
00:13:32.321 --> 00:13:34.990
the actress moved in with mother Jean during her con a license.

258
00:13:35.290 --> 00:13:37.590
She quietly divorced Ross about seven months later,

259
00:13:37.740 --> 00:13:39.510
this was Harlow's last marriage.

260
00:13:39.830 --> 00:13:43.150
Although she soon entered into a long term relationship with actor William

261
00:13:43.150 --> 00:13:44.670
Powell that lasted into her death

262
00:13:51.110 --> 00:13:52.670
Due to Harlow's personal and health problems.

263
00:13:52.910 --> 00:13:56.740
1934 was a lean year for her career. She only appeared in the romantic comedy.

264
00:13:57.120 --> 00:13:59.300
The girl from Missouri, the following year, however,

265
00:13:59.520 --> 00:14:03.260
was meant to be a return for the blond bombshell starring opposite CLA Gable.

266
00:14:03.261 --> 00:14:06.340
Again in the maritime adventure, China sees the movie was a Hearns,

267
00:14:06.460 --> 00:14:07.210
but her medical issues,

268
00:14:07.210 --> 00:14:10.780
lifestyle and beauty treatments were starting to take a to on the young starlet.

269
00:14:11.100 --> 00:14:13.700
Jean Harlow had never been a picture of health when she was a child.

270
00:14:13.720 --> 00:14:16.930
She had suffered from meningitis PO and Scarlet fever as an actress.

271
00:14:17.030 --> 00:14:19.770
She was often on very unhealthy diets in order to stay thin.

272
00:14:19.830 --> 00:14:23.330
And she had been a heavy drinker for most of her time spent in Los Angeles ever

273
00:14:23.331 --> 00:14:25.010
since she came though with her first husband.

274
00:14:25.310 --> 00:14:27.250
And then of course there were the hair treatments.

275
00:14:27.370 --> 00:14:30.170
Publicly Harlow always maintained that her hair was natural blonde,

276
00:14:30.390 --> 00:14:33.970
but it was only after her death that her stylist detailed the extreme procedure.

277
00:14:33.970 --> 00:14:37.040
She underwent in order to achieve her unique PLA of color.

278
00:14:37.220 --> 00:14:41.520
She used a special concoction made out of peroxide, Luxe, brand soap, lakes,

279
00:14:41.521 --> 00:14:43.160
ammonia, Rin, Clorox bleach.

280
00:14:43.330 --> 00:14:46.840
Those last two were particularly bad because combined they make hydrochloric

281
00:14:46.841 --> 00:14:47.800
acid, a strong solution,

282
00:14:47.801 --> 00:14:51.400
which can be found in the gastric acid inside our stomachs and hollow used this

283
00:14:51.401 --> 00:14:53.200
substance on her hair. Once a week,

284
00:14:53.300 --> 00:14:55.800
the mixed ger might have resulted in a unique shade of blondes,

285
00:14:55.801 --> 00:14:56.800
but unsurprisingly,

286
00:14:56.860 --> 00:15:00.720
it was also extremely dangerous and unhealthy by the time Harlow began work on

287
00:15:00.721 --> 00:15:01.440
China season,

288
00:15:01.440 --> 00:15:04.600
her hair had already started falling out in clumps and she was forced to wear a

289
00:15:04.601 --> 00:15:06.520
wig for the duration of the filming. Afterwards,

290
00:15:06.540 --> 00:15:09.640
she abandoned this beauty treatments and adopted more conventional ways of

291
00:15:09.641 --> 00:15:10.474
coloring her hair.

292
00:15:10.930 --> 00:15:14.550
The damage was already done despite her failing health Harlow was pressured to

293
00:15:14.551 --> 00:15:18.950
keep working by the studio and by her mother. So she filmed four movies in 1936,

294
00:15:18.951 --> 00:15:22.790
always receiving top billing, even over other top Hollywood stars of that era,

295
00:15:22.940 --> 00:15:26.990
such as Carrie grant or Spencer Traci, there was no denying her popularity,

296
00:15:27.010 --> 00:15:29.510
but her body simply could not keep up with the demand.

297
00:15:29.690 --> 00:15:33.940
In early 1937 Harlow fell ill with what was believed to be at the time, the flu,

298
00:15:34.000 --> 00:15:35.340
but looking back on it,

299
00:15:35.360 --> 00:15:37.740
it could have been the early stages of something much more serious.

300
00:15:37.910 --> 00:15:41.340
There was not only neglect from the people around her regarding her health,

301
00:15:41.360 --> 00:15:44.420
but Harlow's constant drinking could have obscured some symptoms,

302
00:15:44.421 --> 00:15:47.900
which if court early could have helped save her life. But since time was money,

303
00:15:47.901 --> 00:15:49.180
the actress had to get back to work.

304
00:15:49.240 --> 00:15:51.460
As soon as she was physically able in March 1930s,

305
00:15:51.530 --> 00:15:54.450
seven gene Harlow began work on what would turn out to be her last movie,

306
00:15:54.451 --> 00:15:58.530
another romantic comedy starring opposite Clark Gable titled Saratoga. However,

307
00:15:58.531 --> 00:16:01.930
almost immediately the platinum blonde was dealing with another health issue and

308
00:16:01.931 --> 00:16:03.290
production had to shut down.

309
00:16:03.770 --> 00:16:07.210
Harlow had a mouth infection and she needed all of her wisdom teeth removed to

310
00:16:07.211 --> 00:16:07.730
save time.

311
00:16:07.730 --> 00:16:10.930
Her mother insisted that all 40 were extracted during the same operation.

312
00:16:11.000 --> 00:16:15.280
This was a risky which even caused Harlow's heart to stop beating briefly during

313
00:16:15.281 --> 00:16:16.720
the surgery, despite all of this,

314
00:16:16.721 --> 00:16:19.320
she was not given sufficient time to recuperate. And in April,

315
00:16:19.380 --> 00:16:22.800
she was back on set, even though she had still drained fluid from her mouth.

316
00:16:22.860 --> 00:16:25.760
And she often dealt with bouts of vomiting and abdominal pain.

317
00:16:25.900 --> 00:16:29.160
It was pretty clear that nobody around Harlow cared about her wellbeing or at

318
00:16:29.161 --> 00:16:31.640
the very least not as much as they cared about her career.

319
00:16:31.780 --> 00:16:34.350
Her body could only takes so much. And the predictable happened.

320
00:16:34.710 --> 00:16:36.870
Jean ALO collapsed on set and was taken home.

321
00:16:37.030 --> 00:16:40.590
A doctor diagnosed her with an inflamed Gallad and gave her injections that

322
00:16:40.591 --> 00:16:41.790
should have treated the condition.

323
00:16:42.050 --> 00:16:45.950
She was expected back on set in early June when she didn't show up a co-star

324
00:16:46.230 --> 00:16:48.470
Clark Gable paid a at home and body saw shock him.

325
00:16:48.910 --> 00:16:53.260
Halle had bloated to almost twice her size and she emanated a roting mouth from

326
00:16:53.261 --> 00:16:56.140
her mouth. These were both signs that her kidneys were not working properly.

327
00:16:56.620 --> 00:16:59.420
Another doctor correctly diagnosed that she was suffering from kidney failure.

328
00:16:59.421 --> 00:17:03.180
Unfortunately, neither dialysis or kidney transplants existed back then.

329
00:17:03.440 --> 00:17:05.740
So there was nothing they could do to help her. On June the sixth,

330
00:17:06.020 --> 00:17:09.580
gene Harlow was taken to the hospital where she fell into a coma and she died

331
00:17:09.581 --> 00:17:13.810
the next day, just 26 years old in the decades that followed a room of sister,

332
00:17:14.090 --> 00:17:16.810
that it was Harlow's extreme hair coloring treatments that caused her death.

333
00:17:17.000 --> 00:17:20.850
This has generally been dismissed and although the exact causes are still

334
00:17:20.851 --> 00:17:23.250
undetermined, it is believed that the Scarlet fever,

335
00:17:23.251 --> 00:17:25.210
which Harlow contracted when she was 15,

336
00:17:25.211 --> 00:17:28.170
became the main contributor to her kidney disease. After her death,

337
00:17:28.171 --> 00:17:30.610
the studio wanted to reshoot Saratoga with a different actress,

338
00:17:30.790 --> 00:17:33.130
but following a public outcry from Harlow's fans,

339
00:17:33.160 --> 00:17:35.240
they finished at using a standin.

340
00:17:35.430 --> 00:17:38.640
This photograph was taken onset shortly before Harlow's collapse.

341
00:17:38.740 --> 00:17:41.320
And as it was distributed frequently following her death,

342
00:17:41.321 --> 00:17:45.440
it became the lasting image that the public had of the platinum blonde who took

343
00:17:45.441 --> 00:17:49.840
Hollywood by storm. So I really hope you enjoyed this video.
