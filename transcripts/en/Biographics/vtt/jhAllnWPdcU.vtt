00:00:00.220 --> 00:00:02.910
<v 0>There are probably a few people covered here at biographics who are more</v>

2
00:00:03.480 --> 00:00:07.080
defensive than Ned Kelly. Australia's most famous outlaw and Bush ranger.

3
00:00:07.230 --> 00:00:11.280
He is primarily remembered for his final showdown with the police where Ned and

4
00:00:11.281 --> 00:00:14.730
his men wore homemade armor to some people. He, a folk hero,

5
00:00:14.790 --> 00:00:18.570
a working class revolutionary who took a stand against British colonial

6
00:00:18.571 --> 00:00:19.680
authority to others.

7
00:00:19.681 --> 00:00:24.180
He's simply a cold blooded villain who has been undeservedly mythologized and

8
00:00:24.330 --> 00:00:29.280
morphed into a sort of Robin hood of Australia will that you hear his story and

9
00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:33.750
form your own opinion, but there is one thing for certain, for better or worse.

10
00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:37.080
Ned Kelly has become one of Australia's greatest cultural life.

11
00:00:50.090 --> 00:00:53.120
Ned Kelly was born in Beaver Ridge Victoria,

12
00:00:53.121 --> 00:00:56.030
which back then was still a colony of the British crown.

13
00:00:56.090 --> 00:01:00.770
His date of birth is unknown, but it's generally believed to be either December,

14
00:01:00.770 --> 00:01:05.750
1854 or June, 1855. His father was John Kelly, also known as reds,

15
00:01:05.900 --> 00:01:06.681
an Irish criminal,

16
00:01:06.681 --> 00:01:10.520
who was transported to Australia in his early twenties for stealing pigs.

17
00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:12.860
He served his time on van Diemen's land,

18
00:01:12.890 --> 00:01:15.470
better known today as Tasmania and afterwards,

19
00:01:15.500 --> 00:01:19.220
like many other convicts see chose to remain in Australia and make a new life

20
00:01:19.221 --> 00:01:22.910
for himself. Instead of returning home, read, worked various odd jobs,

21
00:01:22.911 --> 00:01:26.750
which included being a farm hands for the Quinn family group of Irish immigrants

22
00:01:26.751 --> 00:01:28.100
who settled in Melbourne.

23
00:01:28.370 --> 00:01:32.420
Then he met 18 year old Ellen Quinn and the two married in 1850.

24
00:01:32.480 --> 00:01:36.920
This was around the time that Australia became grips with gold fever and many

25
00:01:36.921 --> 00:01:40.520
men tried their luck prospecting. John Kelly was among them.

26
00:01:40.521 --> 00:01:43.010
And while he didn't exactly strike it rich,

27
00:01:43.011 --> 00:01:46.940
he made enough for him in Netherlands to buy a farm of their own in a developing

28
00:01:46.941 --> 00:01:51.140
town called Beaver Ridge that ate children together with Ned being the oldest

29
00:01:51.141 --> 00:01:54.110
son he was named after John's closest brother Edward,

30
00:01:54.190 --> 00:01:55.550
and according to family tradition,

31
00:01:55.551 --> 00:01:57.620
he came into the world with the Eureka rebellion,

32
00:01:57.621 --> 00:02:02.480
a conflict between prospectors and colonial forces, which occurred in late 1854,

33
00:02:02.540 --> 00:02:03.350
quite fittingly,

34
00:02:03.350 --> 00:02:06.740
Ned Kelly would go on to develop an aversion to authority all his life,

35
00:02:06.770 --> 00:02:08.180
particularly to the police.

36
00:02:08.300 --> 00:02:11.630
The family hoped his beverage grew so would their fortunes,

37
00:02:11.660 --> 00:02:12.950
but this didn't happen.

38
00:02:13.190 --> 00:02:16.970
The main road to Beaver Ridge was very treacherous and it's alternative routes

39
00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:20.690
that bypass the town completely became the standard roads travel.

40
00:02:20.750 --> 00:02:24.170
The family farm did not flourish and the Kellys lost money.

41
00:02:24.171 --> 00:02:25.490
And John started drinking.

42
00:02:25.580 --> 00:02:29.570
Things got so bad that eventually they had to sell the farm and move to another

43
00:02:29.571 --> 00:02:32.270
town called Avondale during the mid 1860s.

44
00:02:32.390 --> 00:02:35.900
That Ned Kelly is still remembered by many as a hero even today,

45
00:02:36.020 --> 00:02:39.560
particularly for an incident when he was just 10 years old and he saved the life

46
00:02:39.561 --> 00:02:41.330
of a younger boy who was drowning for this.

47
00:02:41.331 --> 00:02:44.300
He was rewarded with a green sash made out of fine silk.

48
00:02:44.480 --> 00:02:46.580
There came one of Ned's most treasured possessions,

49
00:02:46.581 --> 00:02:50.450
and even wore it under his clothes during his final confrontation with the

50
00:02:50.451 --> 00:02:53.630
police. After first arriving in Australia and serving his time.

51
00:02:53.750 --> 00:02:57.860
John Kelly tried hard to walk the straight and narrow and avoid any more legal

52
00:02:57.861 --> 00:03:01.030
troubles, but temptation the best of him in 1865,

53
00:03:01.031 --> 00:03:04.300
when his family was struggling for food, a calf wandered onto his lands,

54
00:03:04.390 --> 00:03:07.480
even though it was branded as belonging to one, Phillip Morgan drunk,

55
00:03:07.481 --> 00:03:08.890
killed and butchered it from meat.

56
00:03:08.980 --> 00:03:12.820
He was caught and charged with cattle stealing and had to do six months of hard

57
00:03:12.821 --> 00:03:15.910
labor. The work plus the drinking took the toll on John's health.

58
00:03:16.150 --> 00:03:19.480
He died in December, 1866, leaving the twelve-year-old.

59
00:03:19.840 --> 00:03:21.550
Ned is the new man of the family.

60
00:03:27.570 --> 00:03:27.810
<v 1>[Inaudible].</v>

61
00:03:27.810 --> 00:03:30.270
<v 0>A few years later, the Kelly family had to move again.</v>

62
00:03:30.300 --> 00:03:34.560
This time do a stretch of uncultivated farmland outside the town of Gretta.

63
00:03:34.590 --> 00:03:38.580
There, they reunited with a lot of relatives as Ellen's parents and sisters,

64
00:03:38.581 --> 00:03:41.840
along with their own families had relocated to the area wherever they went.

65
00:03:41.880 --> 00:03:45.840
The Quinn's developed a reputation for not being the most law abiding people in

66
00:03:45.841 --> 00:03:50.490
the world and often work used of cattle and horse stealing that began spending a

67
00:03:50.491 --> 00:03:54.930
lot of time with his uncles who undoubtedly influenced his developing behavior.

68
00:03:54.960 --> 00:03:57.630
But the defining moment came in 1869.

69
00:03:57.631 --> 00:04:01.770
When the 14 year old Kelly met Harry power, power real name,

70
00:04:01.771 --> 00:04:04.230
Henry Johnson was a well-known Bush ranger.

71
00:04:04.320 --> 00:04:07.050
Originally Bush Rangers were escaped. Convict convicts,

72
00:04:07.320 --> 00:04:09.540
use the Australian wilderness as a hideout.

73
00:04:09.900 --> 00:04:12.780
It later came to refer to all criminals who hid in the Bush.

74
00:04:12.990 --> 00:04:16.350
They were undoubtedly criminals who committed robberies and even murders,

75
00:04:16.351 --> 00:04:19.830
but they still had their fair share of sympathizes, Ned Kelly,

76
00:04:19.890 --> 00:04:23.730
or to quite a few others became regarded as folk heroes who stood up civil

77
00:04:23.731 --> 00:04:28.350
authority similar to the Outlaws of the American West Harry power was one such

78
00:04:28.351 --> 00:04:31.740
example. The Kellys were as simplifies as nadis in particular,

79
00:04:31.741 --> 00:04:35.730
took an instant liking not only to power, but to the lifestyle itself.

80
00:04:35.820 --> 00:04:37.680
He became the Bush Rangers protege,

81
00:04:37.710 --> 00:04:39.960
helping him steal horses and commit robberies.

82
00:04:40.110 --> 00:04:43.410
Unsurprisingly Ned's first brush with the law occurred at this time when he

83
00:04:43.500 --> 00:04:46.440
stood accused of assaulting and robbing a Chinese merchants,

84
00:04:46.590 --> 00:04:48.210
Ned was arrested when he was 15,

85
00:04:48.211 --> 00:04:51.390
but his sister and two family friends testified that it was in fact,

86
00:04:51.391 --> 00:04:55.800
the merchants who instigated the assaults as the latter had no witnesses on his

87
00:04:55.801 --> 00:05:00.120
side. Police had no choice, but to let Ned Kelly go, he was later again,

88
00:05:00.150 --> 00:05:02.250
arrested as an accomplice in several robberies,

89
00:05:02.251 --> 00:05:05.880
committed by power that none of the victims could positively identify him.

90
00:05:06.030 --> 00:05:09.390
That's association with Harry power. It ended in June,

91
00:05:09.390 --> 00:05:11.610
1870 when the latter was caught and arrested. However,

92
00:05:11.670 --> 00:05:15.270
his influence on his young protege was too much to overcome.

93
00:05:15.271 --> 00:05:19.170
And Ned Kelly had already built a reputation as a local hoodlum and newspaper

94
00:05:19.171 --> 00:05:22.500
called the Benalla Ensign wrote about their relationship saying this.

95
00:05:22.650 --> 00:05:26.970
The effect of power's example has already been to draw one young fellow into the

96
00:05:26.971 --> 00:05:30.960
open vortex of crime. And unless his career is speedily cut short,

97
00:05:31.140 --> 00:05:34.350
young Kennedy will blossom into a declared enemy of society.

98
00:05:41.360 --> 00:05:44.010
Pretty much what happens from that point on Ned.

99
00:05:44.011 --> 00:05:46.320
Kelly always stayed on the wrong side of the law.

100
00:05:46.470 --> 00:05:48.150
Just a few months after power's arrest,

101
00:05:48.180 --> 00:05:52.290
Ned was taken into custody for assaulting a Hawker named Jeremiah McCormack.

102
00:05:52.500 --> 00:05:56.070
This time he was found guilty and sentenced to six months of hard labor.

103
00:05:56.190 --> 00:05:57.150
He was really sturdy,

104
00:05:57.290 --> 00:06:00.140
only enjoyed a few weeks of freedom before being incarcerated.

105
00:06:00.320 --> 00:06:01.340
One small of a horse theft.

106
00:06:01.520 --> 00:06:05.450
This challenge was later downgraded to falling asleep, receiving a horse,

107
00:06:05.451 --> 00:06:08.720
but Kelly still got three years in prison when he was released.

108
00:06:08.990 --> 00:06:11.990
Kelly went back to stealing livestock this time accompanied by his younger

109
00:06:11.991 --> 00:06:13.640
brother, Dan Kelly, a bit later,

110
00:06:13.670 --> 00:06:17.480
they would go on to form the Kelly gang whose other main members included Steve

111
00:06:17.481 --> 00:06:21.170
Hart and John Byrne and other defining moments in the life of Ned Kelly took

112
00:06:21.171 --> 00:06:24.980
place on April the 15th, 1878, known as the Fitzpatrick incidents.

113
00:06:24.980 --> 00:06:29.360
It is sometimes seen as the catalyst that irrevocably put Ned and his brother on

114
00:06:29.361 --> 00:06:32.900
the path of no return as they became wanted fugitives. Unfortunately,

115
00:06:32.901 --> 00:06:36.170
we cannot say with certainty what happened because we have two different

116
00:06:36.171 --> 00:06:40.550
versions of events that's of Constable Alexander Fitzpatrick and that's if the

117
00:06:40.551 --> 00:06:44.960
County family and neither one is a particularly reliable source Fitzpatrick

118
00:06:45.380 --> 00:06:48.440
traveled on that date to the Kelly household to take down into custody as there

119
00:06:48.441 --> 00:06:51.740
was an arrest warrant out on him for horse theft, according to the Constable,

120
00:06:51.741 --> 00:06:55.070
the arrived at the house where he found Dan Kelly, his mother Ellen,

121
00:06:55.071 --> 00:06:58.550
and two associates named William Williamson and bill skillion.

122
00:06:58.610 --> 00:07:01.820
He agreed to allow Dan to finish dinner before taking him in.

123
00:07:01.850 --> 00:07:04.790
But while he was waiting, Neta appeared and restrained him.

124
00:07:04.910 --> 00:07:08.750
The Bush ranger shot Fitzpatrick in the arm while Ellen knocked him unconscious

125
00:07:08.751 --> 00:07:10.940
with a far shovel, they later let him go.

126
00:07:10.940 --> 00:07:13.340
After retrieving the bullet from his hand using a knife,

127
00:07:13.370 --> 00:07:15.110
the Kelly version was a bit different.

128
00:07:15.230 --> 00:07:19.070
They said Fitzpatrick came to the house drunk and without a warrant Ned wasn't

129
00:07:19.071 --> 00:07:22.640
there at the time. It's the Constable native passages sister, Kate Kelly.

130
00:07:22.880 --> 00:07:23.480
At that point,

131
00:07:23.480 --> 00:07:27.110
Dan and Fitzpatrick stones had fighting Constable pulled out his revolver,

132
00:07:27.200 --> 00:07:28.070
right at that moment,

133
00:07:28.220 --> 00:07:31.760
Ned entered the home and helped his brother overpower the police officer who

134
00:07:31.970 --> 00:07:35.330
injured his arm in the scuffle. It was an old established conclusively.

135
00:07:35.450 --> 00:07:37.550
The Fitzpatrick's injury came from a gum shot.

136
00:07:37.730 --> 00:07:41.030
The doctor who inspected him also noted that the Constable smelled of alcohol,

137
00:07:41.031 --> 00:07:44.450
although Fitzpatrick claims that he stopped for a drink on the way back to

138
00:07:44.451 --> 00:07:47.300
steady his nerves. It wasn't the most trustworthy witness,

139
00:07:47.301 --> 00:07:50.780
but the police accepted as evidence anyway, and arrest warrants were issued.

140
00:07:51.080 --> 00:07:55.280
Ned and Dan Kelly went on the run while Ellen Williamson and skillion which

141
00:07:55.281 --> 00:07:59.180
charged and convicted of being accessories to attempted murder public reaction

142
00:07:59.210 --> 00:08:01.100
of the time. It was very negative to the trial,

143
00:08:01.101 --> 00:08:05.330
particularly the sentencing of the elderly Ellen Kelly to hard labor.

144
00:08:05.540 --> 00:08:06.830
Even the Victoria police.

145
00:08:06.831 --> 00:08:10.430
Weren't happy with Fitzpatrick's actions as the commissioner decried them as

146
00:08:10.460 --> 00:08:13.880
generally bad and discreditable to the force. However,

147
00:08:13.910 --> 00:08:17.300
they did generate plenty of sympathy for the Kelly brothers.

148
00:08:23.740 --> 00:08:24.550
<v 2>In hindsight.</v>

149
00:08:24.550 --> 00:08:27.280
<v 0>And Dan with joins by Joe Byrne and Steve Hortons,</v>

150
00:08:27.460 --> 00:08:30.970
the group hopes to raise enough money to appeal, Alan Kelly's sentence.

151
00:08:31.090 --> 00:08:33.400
Like we said, a lot of locals were on their side.

152
00:08:33.401 --> 00:08:36.910
So they were tipped off in late October when the police discovered their

153
00:08:36.911 --> 00:08:41.110
whereabouts and dispatched an armed party to their location, to take them down.

154
00:08:41.140 --> 00:08:44.530
The police group consisted of Forman, Sergeant Kennedy and constables,

155
00:08:44.980 --> 00:08:48.640
Lonergan McEntire and Scanlon on October the 25th, 1878.

156
00:08:48.670 --> 00:08:51.730
They arrived in the camp that stringy bark Creek. However,

157
00:08:51.760 --> 00:08:54.400
none of them were experienced bushmen like Ned Kelly,

158
00:08:54.460 --> 00:08:56.160
knowing that were out there somewhere.

159
00:08:56.340 --> 00:08:59.910
He found their horse tracks and followed them to their camp where Kelly and his

160
00:08:59.911 --> 00:09:02.910
gang took them by surprise. What happened next is again,

161
00:09:02.940 --> 00:09:05.760
a controversial and uncertain matter as accounts differ.

162
00:09:05.910 --> 00:09:09.480
And some argue that the story has been embellished over the decades to portray

163
00:09:09.810 --> 00:09:10.980
Kennedy in a more positive manner.

164
00:09:11.040 --> 00:09:14.520
Basically it all hinges on whether or not the Kelly gang gunned down the

165
00:09:14.970 --> 00:09:15.803
officers in cold blood.

166
00:09:15.960 --> 00:09:18.510
When they mentioned the camp only to policemen with that,

167
00:09:19.040 --> 00:09:22.560
Lonigan the Macintosh Macintosh was quickly disarmed and surrendered peacefully

168
00:09:22.800 --> 00:09:26.520
while Lonigan was shot and killed by net Kelly. Allegedly, he tried to run,

169
00:09:26.521 --> 00:09:28.230
but he hadn't had bad blood.

170
00:09:28.231 --> 00:09:30.600
So it's also possible that Kelly intended to kill him.

171
00:09:30.601 --> 00:09:33.420
Regardless when Scanlan and Kennedy returns to the camp,

172
00:09:33.540 --> 00:09:37.200
they found Macintosh sitting on a log ins, the Kelly gang waiting an ambush,

173
00:09:37.380 --> 00:09:41.400
a shootout ensued where Scanlon was shot dead and Kennedy was mortally injured,

174
00:09:41.430 --> 00:09:43.530
crawling a few hundred feet before dying.

175
00:09:43.740 --> 00:09:47.220
During the chaos Macintosh managed to jump on a horse and make a run for it.

176
00:09:47.430 --> 00:09:50.760
He reached civilization and informed everyone that the Kelly gang had just

177
00:09:50.761 --> 00:09:54.060
murdered three police officers, whether or not the officers would have lived.

178
00:09:54.061 --> 00:09:55.680
If they surrendered, we cannot say.

179
00:09:55.681 --> 00:09:59.340
But from that point on the Kelly gang were officially declared Outlaws by the

180
00:09:59.341 --> 00:10:02.880
governor of Victoria under the reasonably passed felons apprehension act.

181
00:10:02.910 --> 00:10:06.420
They basically had no more rights. They could be shot on site,

182
00:10:06.690 --> 00:10:07.800
even if they were captured.

183
00:10:08.390 --> 00:10:09.223
<v 1>Alive.</v>

184
00:10:14.690 --> 00:10:17.090
<v 0>The Kelly gang were active for approximately two years,</v>

185
00:10:17.091 --> 00:10:20.540
but they spent most of that time in hiding in the Australian Bush,

186
00:10:20.570 --> 00:10:23.120
relying on friendlies to provide them with food and lodging.

187
00:10:23.150 --> 00:10:26.720
The police knew this since they could not capture the Kelly gang.

188
00:10:26.721 --> 00:10:29.510
They decided to crack down hard on their sympathizers.

189
00:10:29.630 --> 00:10:30.920
Fortunately for the authorities,

190
00:10:30.921 --> 00:10:34.370
the AFA mention felons apprehension act also allowed them to punish those who

191
00:10:34.371 --> 00:10:37.430
offered any aid shelter or sustenance Outlaws.

192
00:10:37.490 --> 00:10:39.110
So they were pretty much free to in prison.

193
00:10:39.140 --> 00:10:42.680
Anyone they felt were on the side of Ned Kelly in one particularly egregious

194
00:10:42.681 --> 00:10:44.630
example in January, 1879,

195
00:10:44.750 --> 00:10:48.890
one captain Standish rounds it up 23 men who were believed to be either friends

196
00:10:48.891 --> 00:10:52.700
or sympathizers of the Outlaws and in prison them for months without charge.

197
00:10:52.790 --> 00:10:56.180
If anything is such abuse as a power only serve to portray Ned Kelly in a more

198
00:10:56.181 --> 00:10:59.990
positive light as more and more people began to see him as a man fighting

199
00:10:59.991 --> 00:11:01.070
against injustice.

200
00:11:01.100 --> 00:11:05.060
The Bush ranger helps enhance this reputation by rising the so-called Gerald

201
00:11:05.330 --> 00:11:09.140
Arie letter, a 56 page 8,300 word bene Festo,

202
00:11:09.290 --> 00:11:11.470
where he decried the abuses of the police,

203
00:11:11.660 --> 00:11:16.460
whom he described as a parcel of big ugly, fast neck, wombat headed big bellied,

204
00:11:17.030 --> 00:11:17.480
magpies and legs,

205
00:11:17.480 --> 00:11:21.830
narrow hips to explore footed sons of Irish bailiffs or English landlords,

206
00:11:21.860 --> 00:11:26.420
which is better known as the offices of justice or Victorian police SU

207
00:11:26.510 --> 00:11:30.650
some goal honest gentlemen in the lesser Kelly argued that he was forced into

208
00:11:30.651 --> 00:11:34.340
becoming an outlaw by circumstances outside of his control. He still blamed.

209
00:11:34.790 --> 00:11:38.420
Constable Fitzpatrick is the one who started all of this and called for justice.

210
00:11:38.421 --> 00:11:39.290
Not only for him,

211
00:11:39.470 --> 00:11:43.850
but for all the poor families of Australia who were subjugated by the terrorism

212
00:11:44.060 --> 00:11:46.430
of the English yoke. During that time on the run,

213
00:11:46.431 --> 00:11:49.880
the Kelly gang did have moments when they behave more like traditional Outlaws

214
00:11:50.060 --> 00:11:51.320
is they robbed two banks.

215
00:11:51.380 --> 00:11:55.030
The first one in the town of Euro took on December the 10th, 1878,

216
00:11:55.031 --> 00:11:57.310
shortly after the shootout at stringy bark Creek,

217
00:11:57.340 --> 00:12:00.190
the gang needed money and supplies to go into hiding. First,

218
00:12:00.191 --> 00:12:03.790
they held up the nearby train station at faithful's creeks so they could rest

219
00:12:03.791 --> 00:12:07.660
the horses dress up and respectable clothing and Telegraph lines.

220
00:12:07.720 --> 00:12:11.470
Everyone who came to investigate was taken hostage and placed inside a store in

221
00:12:11.890 --> 00:12:12.250
Bern,

222
00:12:12.250 --> 00:12:15.580
stayed behind with the hostages while the other three went to Euroa bank and

223
00:12:15.581 --> 00:12:18.310
cleaned it out. They then took the bank manager, Robert Scott,

224
00:12:18.311 --> 00:12:21.430
and his family back to the story. So they couldn't raise the alarm.

225
00:12:21.640 --> 00:12:24.430
And then they rode away leaving everyone's safe and uninjured.

226
00:12:24.460 --> 00:12:26.320
There are additional details to this story,

227
00:12:26.321 --> 00:12:28.060
such as the gang giving the hostages,

228
00:12:28.061 --> 00:12:32.290
they horse trick riding show before leaving or Scott being so friendly with his

229
00:12:32.291 --> 00:12:36.070
robbers, that they drank a whiskey together off to the empty to safe.

230
00:12:36.100 --> 00:12:39.940
But it is hard to tell at this point of such things actually happens or they are

231
00:12:40.120 --> 00:12:45.040
just more examples of colorful events added to boost the legend of Ned Kelly.

232
00:12:45.130 --> 00:12:49.510
The second bank robbery occurred a few months later on February, the 10th, 1879,

233
00:12:49.600 --> 00:12:51.730
and Gerald airy. The plan was similar.

234
00:12:51.760 --> 00:12:54.610
Although this one was more ambitious in its execution.

235
00:12:54.700 --> 00:12:57.520
The night before the gang descended upon the local police barracks,

236
00:12:57.521 --> 00:13:01.150
where they took the only two offices inside as hostages, the next day,

237
00:13:01.151 --> 00:13:04.180
they dressed up in police uniforms and managed to Rob the bank without any

238
00:13:04.181 --> 00:13:04.960
violence.

239
00:13:04.960 --> 00:13:08.770
They also bounce a of mortgage documents and took their horses to the local

240
00:13:09.370 --> 00:13:12.100
blacksmith to get reissued posing the work on the police tab.

241
00:13:12.250 --> 00:13:15.490
This is also when Kelly left behind his famous Gerald Arie letter,

242
00:13:15.520 --> 00:13:19.290
although it wouldn't be published in its entirety until 1930.

243
00:13:25.290 --> 00:13:25.560
<v 1>[Inaudible].</v>

244
00:13:25.560 --> 00:13:28.680
<v 0>Following the two robberies authorities stepped up their efforts to hunt down</v>

245
00:13:28.681 --> 00:13:31.350
the Kelly gang, even more with contributions from banks.

246
00:13:31.380 --> 00:13:32.970
They increased the reward for their capture.

247
00:13:33.090 --> 00:13:36.330
It's a 2000 pounds per head for a total of about 8,000 pounds,

248
00:13:36.360 --> 00:13:39.780
which is about 1.5 million Australian dollars in modern currency.

249
00:13:39.810 --> 00:13:42.720
They also brought in an easy police unit from Queensland,

250
00:13:42.750 --> 00:13:46.590
which contained Aboriginal troopers who were more adept at tracking people in

251
00:13:46.591 --> 00:13:49.350
the Bush. Ultimately they were able to find the Outlaws,

252
00:13:49.351 --> 00:13:52.800
but it has been speculated that their efforts were hampered at every turn,

253
00:13:52.801 --> 00:13:56.460
by the Victoria police who didn't want it to get upstaged by the Queenslanders.

254
00:13:56.490 --> 00:13:59.220
They were already deeply unpopular with the people of Victoria.

255
00:13:59.280 --> 00:14:03.600
Those who sympathized with Ned Kelly considered them to be corrupt and abusive.

256
00:14:03.660 --> 00:14:07.410
Those who didn't still regarded them as incompetent for being unable to capture

257
00:14:07.411 --> 00:14:07.920
the gang.

258
00:14:07.920 --> 00:14:11.400
The last thing they needed was for the Queensland is to do that job for them.

259
00:14:11.580 --> 00:14:14.070
In the end, it was the money that gave them the advantage.

260
00:14:14.100 --> 00:14:16.260
The Kelly gang may have been popular with the people,

261
00:14:16.261 --> 00:14:19.590
but it was inevitable that someone would ultimately choose funds over

262
00:14:19.591 --> 00:14:21.960
friendship, that someone was Aaron sharer.

263
00:14:21.961 --> 00:14:25.620
So friends of the gang members who was particularly close to Joe Burton,

264
00:14:25.710 --> 00:14:27.210
he became an informant for the police.

265
00:14:27.211 --> 00:14:30.420
Although some believed he was actually trying to act as a double agent.

266
00:14:30.480 --> 00:14:32.010
Even the authorities suspected this,

267
00:14:32.011 --> 00:14:35.250
but they found a way of making him useful regardless of his true loyalties,

268
00:14:35.280 --> 00:14:37.890
the police made sure that word spread around that share.

269
00:14:37.891 --> 00:14:38.760
It was working with them.

270
00:14:38.820 --> 00:14:41.370
They were hoping to entice the Kelly gang out of hiding,

271
00:14:41.371 --> 00:14:45.600
using share it more as bait than as an informant. This actually worked.

272
00:14:45.630 --> 00:14:48.270
The gang felt betrayed by sharers and burn in particular,

273
00:14:48.450 --> 00:14:50.700
wanted him dead on June the sixth, 1880.

274
00:14:50.701 --> 00:14:54.050
He and Dan Kelly traveled to wool shed Creek where Sharon lived.

275
00:14:54.140 --> 00:14:56.810
There were four police officers inside the Sherrard home that night.

276
00:14:56.811 --> 00:14:59.810
So the gang needed a way of separating that target from the group.

277
00:15:00.020 --> 00:15:02.960
They kidnapped a neighbor and brought him to the front door of the Sheriff's

278
00:15:02.961 --> 00:15:04.310
house while they learned hiding.

279
00:15:04.460 --> 00:15:07.910
They made him call out for sharer to recognized his neighbor's voice and

280
00:15:07.911 --> 00:15:10.130
answered the door without hesitation. At that point,

281
00:15:10.610 --> 00:15:13.190
Bern popped down to the shadows and shot him through the hat.

282
00:15:13.400 --> 00:15:17.540
This was the first part of that plan is the Kelly gang sets only enacting the

283
00:15:17.541 --> 00:15:20.240
most ambitious and most violent ploy. Yes.

284
00:15:20.330 --> 00:15:23.540
They knew that the police inside sheruts home would send word of what had

285
00:15:23.541 --> 00:15:27.380
happened to Melbourne, who in turn would send reinforcements by special train.

286
00:15:27.530 --> 00:15:31.310
The rail would pass through a city called Bonilla where undoubtedly more

287
00:15:31.311 --> 00:15:32.630
officers would join the hums.

288
00:15:32.631 --> 00:15:36.530
And then through a town called Glenn Rowen while Dan and Ben delts with

289
00:15:37.040 --> 00:15:39.650
sheriffs, Ned and Steve Hart traveled to Glen Rowan.

290
00:15:39.770 --> 00:15:43.100
Their intention was to run the train off the track, kill any survivors,

291
00:15:43.101 --> 00:15:44.180
and then go onto Bonilla,

292
00:15:44.181 --> 00:15:46.760
which left without a police force would have been easy pickings.

293
00:15:46.910 --> 00:15:47.660
So their sentence,

294
00:15:47.660 --> 00:15:51.200
nebs and tasks kidnapped to railway workers and forced them at gunpoint damage

295
00:15:51.210 --> 00:15:54.830
the track over steep ravine afterwards, they went inside the town,

296
00:15:54.950 --> 00:15:58.850
took the locals hostage and pack them inside the Glen road in waiting for the

297
00:15:58.851 --> 00:16:00.380
train to arrive from Manila.

298
00:16:00.530 --> 00:16:03.050
This was all building up to one bloody confrontation,

299
00:16:03.080 --> 00:16:06.500
but the Kelly gang had one last memorable ACE up their sleeves.

300
00:16:06.530 --> 00:16:09.050
One so unusual that the police didn't even believe it.

301
00:16:09.051 --> 00:16:12.110
When they heard reports from the locals over the course of the previous months,

302
00:16:12.111 --> 00:16:15.800
the gang members had constructed who made armor for themselves out of pieces of

303
00:16:15.801 --> 00:16:20.120
metal plow moldboards they weighed almost a hundred pounds, each iconic look,

304
00:16:20.121 --> 00:16:23.420
which was plastered over every newspaper in Australia. Undoubtedly,

305
00:16:23.480 --> 00:16:25.760
it was instrumental in creating the legend of Ned.

306
00:16:25.761 --> 00:16:29.330
Kelly is almost a day as a place of honor at the state library of Victoria.

307
00:16:29.360 --> 00:16:33.850
Those of Dan and hotter on display at the Victoria police museum while burns is

308
00:16:33.851 --> 00:16:36.250
in private hands. But back to the night in question,

309
00:16:36.310 --> 00:16:40.540
the Kelly gang had over 60 hostages, Glen run it. They pass the time with music,

310
00:16:40.570 --> 00:16:44.080
dancing games and drinking. Everybody was seemingly having a good time,

311
00:16:44.081 --> 00:16:45.850
even perhaps too much of a good time.

312
00:16:46.060 --> 00:16:48.790
As he became convinced that he was surrounded by sympathizes,

313
00:16:49.120 --> 00:16:50.890
that let his guard down and allowed the local.

314
00:16:51.580 --> 00:16:54.850
Schoolmaster a man named Thomas kernel to return home and go to sleep.

315
00:16:55.390 --> 00:16:56.740
Kernel was not only a sympathizer,

316
00:16:56.920 --> 00:17:00.520
but he had overheard the gangs plan of derating. The train. He went home,

317
00:17:00.550 --> 00:17:04.300
grabbed a candle and a red handkerchief and went to the railway to find the spot

318
00:17:04.450 --> 00:17:06.760
where the tracks had been damaged after locating it.

319
00:17:06.790 --> 00:17:08.840
He managed to signal the engine driver in time,

320
00:17:09.010 --> 00:17:10.210
then to stop the train derailing,

321
00:17:10.300 --> 00:17:13.900
the entire police force was alive and well and headed for the Glen run in.

322
00:17:14.170 --> 00:17:16.330
They surrounded the hotel and the shooting started.

323
00:17:16.510 --> 00:17:18.700
The Kelly gang quickly saw that their planet fails,

324
00:17:18.710 --> 00:17:22.180
but had no intention of surrendering. They put on their armor and fought back.

325
00:17:22.390 --> 00:17:24.190
Most of the house just made it out safely.

326
00:17:24.370 --> 00:17:27.070
The women and children were released at the beginning and most of the rest

327
00:17:27.071 --> 00:17:30.100
managed to sneak out the back during the chaos, two bystanders,

328
00:17:30.130 --> 00:17:34.030
both men were caught in the gunfire and died after sustaining a few minor

329
00:17:34.031 --> 00:17:36.580
injuries. The Outlaws retreated further inside the hotel,

330
00:17:36.640 --> 00:17:40.330
except for Ned Kelly who ran into the Bush intending to circle around and flank.

331
00:17:40.331 --> 00:17:40.870
The police,

332
00:17:40.870 --> 00:17:44.740
Joe Byrne was the first to die abilities in the thigh and severed his femoral

333
00:17:44.741 --> 00:17:46.300
artery causing him to bleed out.

334
00:17:46.420 --> 00:17:49.080
Then came the most spectacular moment of the shootouts.

335
00:17:49.410 --> 00:17:54.330
Ned Kelly emerged out of the dark mist cloud in Alma and guns blazing the same

336
00:17:54.331 --> 00:17:56.730
made the police think that they were fighting the devil himself.

337
00:17:56.731 --> 00:17:59.370
And Dick took the minutes to finally understand what was happening.

338
00:17:59.430 --> 00:18:02.490
Eventually they realized that Ned's legs were completely unprotected.

339
00:18:02.491 --> 00:18:03.990
So they aimed for those.

340
00:18:04.380 --> 00:18:07.530
Kelly took several shots before finally collapsing and surrendering.

341
00:18:07.770 --> 00:18:08.760
He was captured alive,

342
00:18:08.790 --> 00:18:11.820
but Dan Kelly and Steve hall was still shooting from inside the hotel.

343
00:18:12.030 --> 00:18:14.400
By this point, all the hostages had been evacuated.

344
00:18:14.520 --> 00:18:18.040
The police had an artillery cannon coming in from Melbourne and they intended to

345
00:18:18.360 --> 00:18:21.480
blow the entire hotel to smithereens. However, this took too long.

346
00:18:21.481 --> 00:18:24.000
So instead they burned it to the grounds later,

347
00:18:24.030 --> 00:18:27.750
they found the charred bodies of Kelly and heart and side who apparently died of

348
00:18:27.751 --> 00:18:32.190
suicide by poison. And so the Kelly gang came to a bloody fiery end,

349
00:18:32.280 --> 00:18:36.420
only Ned Kelly lived following the Glen Ron siege, but unsurprisingly,

350
00:18:36.600 --> 00:18:39.990
it was tried for his crimes, found guilty and sentenced to death.

351
00:18:40.170 --> 00:18:42.930
He still had tons of supporters who campaign for a reprieve,

352
00:18:42.960 --> 00:18:46.830
but that please went on heated. Ned Kelly was hanged on November the 11th,

353
00:18:46.860 --> 00:18:48.720
1880 at the Melbourne jail.

354
00:18:48.900 --> 00:18:52.850
According to some reports as last words were such as.
