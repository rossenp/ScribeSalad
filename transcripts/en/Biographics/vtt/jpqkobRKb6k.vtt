2
00:00:03.481 --> 00:00:06.680
millions come together to take the next step in their creative journey.

3
00:00:07.280 --> 00:00:10.720
Thousands of classes on lots of topics, more on them in a bit,

4
00:00:16.940 --> 00:00:19.480
For as long as mankind has had currency,

5
00:00:19.880 --> 00:00:22.150
a system rating and a market economy.

6
00:00:22.450 --> 00:00:26.270
The world has been split into the haves and the have nots.

7
00:00:26.490 --> 00:00:30.070
And for much of that time, there's been a huge gap between the two,

8
00:00:30.450 --> 00:00:33.990
the idea of the 1%, isn't a new concept by any means.

9
00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:37.310
And in order to talk about one of the richest men in history,

10
00:00:37.600 --> 00:00:40.430
we'll have to go all the way back to the 15th century.

11
00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:42.860
Annie would become known as Yakob fogger.

12
00:00:42.861 --> 00:00:47.500
The rich was born in 1459 and he had an advantage that few people

13
00:00:47.720 --> 00:00:51.060
get then, or now he was born into a well to do family,

14
00:00:51.400 --> 00:00:54.740
but through a series of investments made with incredible foresight and

15
00:00:54.741 --> 00:00:55.700
willingness to risk it,

16
00:00:55.701 --> 00:01:00.460
all fogger guided his family to become one of the richest ands most influential

17
00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:03.730
in history. Here is how he did it.

18
00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:13.730
Since we're going to be talking about yak of fogger in the context of his

19
00:01:13.731 --> 00:01:14.040
wealth,

20
00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:18.090
it's worth investigating just how rich he really was perspective is key after

21
00:01:18.410 --> 00:01:18.470
all.

22
00:01:18.470 --> 00:01:23.120
So let's compare his fortune to that of people who might be a little bit more

23
00:01:23.440 --> 00:01:27.240
familiar take bill gates, his highest net worth. It's a seriously impressive,

24
00:01:27.241 --> 00:01:28.480
144 billion.

25
00:01:29.360 --> 00:01:32.560
Although he gives so much money away through his foundation that that's not

26
00:01:32.561 --> 00:01:35.440
really an accurate picture. Go back in time, about 200 years.

27
00:01:35.500 --> 00:01:37.120
And then we have John Jacob Cabasta.

28
00:01:37.400 --> 00:01:41.280
He has the honor of being America's first multi-millionaire that he controlled

29
00:01:41.281 --> 00:01:44.830
much of the third in the early 19th century. And when he died,

30
00:01:44.831 --> 00:01:48.990
he was worth what would be around 168 billion in today's money.

31
00:01:49.080 --> 00:01:52.990
Henry Ford tips, the scales at around 200 billion in today's money,

32
00:01:53.080 --> 00:01:56.670
which puts him right alongside names like Cornelius, Vanderbilt,

33
00:01:56.690 --> 00:02:01.310
and mu Mar Affy Rockefeller and Carnegie comes somewhere in the middle of the

34
00:02:01.440 --> 00:02:05.740
300 billion fogger. Well, it was richer than all of them.

35
00:02:05.741 --> 00:02:06.860
There's a few different ways.

36
00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:10.060
You can look at wealth and given the fast changing modern economy,

37
00:02:10.130 --> 00:02:11.500
plus factoring in inflation,

38
00:02:12.020 --> 00:02:15.700
a simple numerical comparison doesn't really carry that much weight.

39
00:02:16.010 --> 00:02:19.780
It's estimated that in today's us currency fogger would have a net worth of

40
00:02:19.781 --> 00:02:22.060
somewhere around $400 billion,

41
00:02:22.280 --> 00:02:27.090
but there's a lot more or to it than that consider forger in a grand

42
00:02:27.091 --> 00:02:31.650
context. If you took Europe's entire economic output at the time he owned

43
00:02:31.870 --> 00:02:35.170
2.2% of that. If that doesn't sound like much,

44
00:02:35.570 --> 00:02:39.810
remember we are talking about representing more than two percents of an entire

45
00:02:40.300 --> 00:02:41.133
continents,

46
00:02:41.330 --> 00:02:45.600
economic for reference examine John D AE Fell's value when he died in

47
00:02:45.800 --> 00:02:46.633
1937,

48
00:02:46.700 --> 00:02:50.840
and he only owned 1.5% of America's gross domestic products.

49
00:02:51.100 --> 00:02:55.600
And that's just one country. But before you get bod down by dollar signs,

50
00:02:55.610 --> 00:02:58.800
don't forget. We aren't just talking about the value of money.

51
00:02:59.520 --> 00:03:01.720
Foggo wield did a great deal of power and influence,

52
00:03:01.820 --> 00:03:04.920
and that can be the most valuable currency of all

53
00:03:11.680 --> 00:03:11.681
Yakob.

54
00:03:11.681 --> 00:03:15.880
The Ridge may have been the economic sevans who catapulted the family fortune to

55
00:03:16.200 --> 00:03:20.270
newfound Heights, but the Foggo fortune was built on the shoulders of one. Man.

56
00:03:20.320 --> 00:03:23.910
There are a few others in the family that deserve an honorable mention.

57
00:03:24.460 --> 00:03:28.630
Jacob's grandfather hungs was born into a peasant family in Southern Germany by

58
00:03:28.870 --> 00:03:33.390
1367. He had moved to Augsburg and made a few wise choices in the game of love.

59
00:03:33.490 --> 00:03:37.110
He married twice and both of his wives were the daughters of masters in the

60
00:03:37.111 --> 00:03:40.820
weavers Guild. That's not to, he was a master Weaver himself though.

61
00:03:41.300 --> 00:03:42.130
Hans didn't weave at all.

62
00:03:42.130 --> 00:03:46.580
What he did do was act as the middle man providing raw materials for those who

63
00:03:46.581 --> 00:03:48.260
performed the manual labor later,

64
00:03:48.480 --> 00:03:51.740
he would buy the finished textiles and sell them for a massive profit.

65
00:03:52.010 --> 00:03:54.060
From there, he moved up in the guilt himself,

66
00:03:54.061 --> 00:03:57.220
earning a spot on the committee and eventually serving on the great council of

67
00:03:57.620 --> 00:04:01.570
Oberg. Hans died in 40 0 8, but he, he didn't pass the business onto his sons.

68
00:04:01.760 --> 00:04:02.730
Instead his wife,

69
00:04:02.731 --> 00:04:07.050
Elizabeth took over the reins and spent the next 28 years using our own business

70
00:04:07.060 --> 00:04:09.730
savvy to continue growing the family's wealth.

71
00:04:10.280 --> 00:04:12.450
Hans had two sons of note Andreas,

72
00:04:12.510 --> 00:04:17.170
and YAB the first and eventually they made their own fortunes and contributed to

73
00:04:17.171 --> 00:04:17.840
the families.

74
00:04:17.840 --> 00:04:21.400
They were Goldsmiths and they worked together in till disagreements led to a

75
00:04:21.401 --> 00:04:26.120
split in 1454, even though Andreas had more immediate success,

76
00:04:26.150 --> 00:04:29.440
that branch of the family was bankrupt by 1499.

77
00:04:30.140 --> 00:04:30.950
<v 1>ABA on the other hand,</v>

78
00:04:30.950 --> 00:04:35.240
increased his wealth than standing slowly but surely he married the daughter of

79
00:04:35.241 --> 00:04:39.160
a men's master and they raised seven sons all while he grew his status.

80
00:04:39.540 --> 00:04:41.790
As a member of city's merchants Guild,

81
00:04:42.130 --> 00:04:45.470
two of his sons were groomed to take over the financial side of the business.

82
00:04:45.570 --> 00:04:48.590
The youngest YAB the seconds, our future Yakob,

83
00:04:48.650 --> 00:04:53.510
the rich was like many youngest sons were on his way to being educated

84
00:04:53.690 --> 00:04:57.030
for a place in the clergy YAB but also known as YAB.

85
00:04:57.030 --> 00:05:00.430
<v 0>The elder died in 1469 for the next 28 years.</v>

86
00:05:00.500 --> 00:05:04.220
Once the business affairs weren't in the hands of any of the sons,

87
00:05:04.440 --> 00:05:08.020
but were managed by the deceased's wife, Barbara Bassinger,

88
00:05:08.120 --> 00:05:10.740
she spent nearly three decades buying and selling.

89
00:05:10.840 --> 00:05:14.020
And when it came time to hand over control to the next generation,

90
00:05:14.200 --> 00:05:16.300
the family was already quite wealthy.

91
00:05:16.520 --> 00:05:20.940
It was Barbara who sent a youngest son off, not just to ecclesiastic studies,

92
00:05:21.080 --> 00:05:25.290
but learned banking and bookkeeping as well. Yak of thei was just a teenager.

93
00:05:25.480 --> 00:05:29.650
When he was sent off to Venice to learn the ins and outs of commerce in a major

94
00:05:29.930 --> 00:05:31.850
European city. By the time he came back,

95
00:05:31.950 --> 00:05:33.970
he had learned skills that would serve him. Well,

96
00:05:34.110 --> 00:05:36.530
he studied not just the principles of trading and commerce,

97
00:05:36.710 --> 00:05:40.130
but he also learned how to read, write, and speak multiple languages.

98
00:05:40.230 --> 00:05:43.240
He also mastered more obscure things like the formulas,

99
00:05:43.241 --> 00:05:46.640
making conversions between various weights measures and currencies.

100
00:05:46.860 --> 00:05:49.960
And then there was accounting. The idea is common enough today,

101
00:05:49.961 --> 00:05:54.160
but at the time German merchants or relied heavily on a haphazard system of

102
00:05:54.161 --> 00:05:58.600
receipts organization was rarely included as a part of a German merchants job

103
00:05:58.601 --> 00:06:01.840
description, but things were quite different in Italy there,

104
00:06:01.841 --> 00:06:05.560
they had developed extensive systems of bookkeeping and accounting procedure

105
00:06:05.561 --> 00:06:09.960
that made it possible to stay on top of multinational companies and trade that

106
00:06:10.050 --> 00:06:11.520
spans the length of the silk road.

107
00:06:12.200 --> 00:06:14.880
Yer was going to need to know how to do all of it.

108
00:06:15.380 --> 00:06:18.750
But just before we get to him learning that I want to take a moment to tell you

136
00:07:44.530 --> 00:07:47.030
It was several years before yakka returned to Germany.

137
00:07:47.170 --> 00:07:50.470
And by that time his older brother had already set up a firm of their own.

138
00:07:50.650 --> 00:07:54.910
It was called UG and brothers and yakka started out with a

139
00:07:54.911 --> 00:07:56.510
29% ownership stake.

140
00:07:56.570 --> 00:08:00.020
He wasn't working with them belong when he witnessed a deal that made a lasting

141
00:08:00.021 --> 00:08:04.340
impact on him and taught him a very important lesson about the makings of a king

142
00:08:05.060 --> 00:08:09.340
or Rick Fuga was approached by the Hapsburg emperor Frederick II.

143
00:08:09.600 --> 00:08:14.220
He was installed as holy Roman emperor in 1452 and his reign was both

144
00:08:14.221 --> 00:08:16.500
turbulence and historically significant.

145
00:08:16.840 --> 00:08:21.570
He dealt with a series of revolt and revolution as well as continued unrest on

146
00:08:21.571 --> 00:08:22.970
the Eastern border of his kingdom.

147
00:08:23.190 --> 00:08:26.450
He was on the front lines of the long running battle between the Ottoman am

148
00:08:26.690 --> 00:08:30.090
empire and Christie and Europe maintaining a firm relationship with the church,

149
00:08:30.310 --> 00:08:33.890
but struggling to consolidate his territory into a unified power.

150
00:08:33.990 --> 00:08:37.730
One of the most important things he's still known for isn't necessarily what he

151
00:08:37.790 --> 00:08:41.680
did, but what he laid the grounds were in 1477,

152
00:08:41.681 --> 00:08:45.840
he made a deal to join his family with the duke of burgundies of either marriage

153
00:08:45.841 --> 00:08:46.580
of his son,

154
00:08:46.580 --> 00:08:50.720
to the daughter of Charles bold before the marriage could be agreed upon though,

155
00:08:50.721 --> 00:08:54.960
Frederick needed to impress the Burgundians to prove his family's worthiness

156
00:08:55.070 --> 00:08:56.440
with coffers running dry.

157
00:08:56.500 --> 00:09:01.280
He turned to the FOS Frederick II found himself in di need to find textiles.

158
00:09:01.281 --> 00:09:05.880
And that was precisely what the fogger family did best yakka watched.

159
00:09:06.120 --> 00:09:09.480
As his older brother made the deal. He would give the holy Roman emperor,

160
00:09:09.481 --> 00:09:12.160
the fine silks and will he needed to impress Charles,

161
00:09:12.540 --> 00:09:14.400
but he wanted something in return.

162
00:09:14.740 --> 00:09:18.630
This was a coat of arms bestowed upon all of the fo brothers.

163
00:09:18.730 --> 00:09:20.870
It doesn't sound like much, but for the family,

164
00:09:21.010 --> 00:09:25.150
it was a huge deal that allowed them to rise from just being well todo members

165
00:09:25.330 --> 00:09:29.990
of the merchant class to being a bonified family of standing and

166
00:09:30.160 --> 00:09:31.830
clout. It was a win-win.

167
00:09:31.930 --> 00:09:34.710
The deal also helped Frederick to close on the marriage,

168
00:09:35.620 --> 00:09:39.220
which in turn consolidated power and made Austria a force to be reckoned with

169
00:09:39.410 --> 00:09:44.100
from all of this YAB learns that even Kings would bend to the knee before money.

170
00:09:44.470 --> 00:09:47.500
Every haggle might come with some natural give or take,

171
00:09:47.760 --> 00:09:52.300
but a careful negotiation could have a very far reaching outcome. Indeed.

172
00:09:52.680 --> 00:09:55.380
In 1485, YAB made his first solo.

173
00:09:55.790 --> 00:10:00.130
The 26 year old was still working for his brothers when headed off toz Austria

174
00:10:00.480 --> 00:10:02.930
with a desire to break into the mining industry.

175
00:10:03.070 --> 00:10:06.290
His brothers had given him full authority to make any business decisions he

176
00:10:06.291 --> 00:10:07.124
deemed appropriate,

177
00:10:07.140 --> 00:10:11.290
which turned down to be one of the better decisions that the family made YAB met

178
00:10:11.291 --> 00:10:15.690
with. Sigmans the aunt duke of Austria and ruler of roll prior to his,

179
00:10:16.520 --> 00:10:19.840
of these particular titles. Sigmans was a ward of his cousin.

180
00:10:20.020 --> 00:10:24.800
The a mentioned emperor Frederick III when he was given Regency over to and

181
00:10:24.801 --> 00:10:25.880
several other territories,

182
00:10:26.100 --> 00:10:30.080
he was handed incredibly valuable lands rich with silver mines.

183
00:10:30.260 --> 00:10:33.880
And while Sigmans may have been instrumental in promoting and growing his

184
00:10:34.280 --> 00:10:35.100
country's mining industry,

185
00:10:35.100 --> 00:10:39.390
he also liked to spends money as fast as it was being mines.

186
00:10:39.570 --> 00:10:42.790
His love of extravagance sent him the apathetic rich coin,

187
00:10:42.890 --> 00:10:46.070
but he wasn't always able to keep up with his spending.

188
00:10:46.290 --> 00:10:48.910
And this is where Yakup fogger enters the picture.

189
00:10:49.170 --> 00:10:52.270
He had the extra cash that Sigman so desperately needed.

190
00:10:52.370 --> 00:10:56.590
So they struck an intriguing deal. Yakup agreed to lend the orange Jew, okay.

191
00:10:56.790 --> 00:11:00.460
Sizable sun. And in return, the figures would gain the rights to the areas,

192
00:11:00.461 --> 00:11:01.150
silver minds,

193
00:11:01.150 --> 00:11:05.420
money up front in return for the possibility of money in the future teams like a

194
00:11:05.421 --> 00:11:06.160
brilliant trade.

195
00:11:06.160 --> 00:11:10.660
So Sigman took it in exchange for a thousand pounds of silver delivered over

196
00:11:10.661 --> 00:11:14.380
several installments. He did in fact, deliver the mind silver as promised,

197
00:11:14.381 --> 00:11:17.930
which wasn't always a guarantee there's an large Juy could have of just

198
00:11:17.931 --> 00:11:21.530
leveraged his own power and standing to decide he wasn't going to bother with

199
00:11:21.531 --> 00:11:22.200
repayments.

200
00:11:22.200 --> 00:11:26.770
Fortunately for the foggers the delivery came in right on time and Yaka was able

201
00:11:26.830 --> 00:11:29.850
to sell that same silver in Venice at a 50% markup.

202
00:11:30.030 --> 00:11:31.970
And that's what we call good business.

203
00:11:32.270 --> 00:11:34.970
The fogger fortune didn't come from that thousand pounds of silver,

204
00:11:35.230 --> 00:11:39.880
but that first deal did something else cemented a relationship between the

205
00:11:40.360 --> 00:11:43.080
Hapsburg dynasty and the fogger banking em empire,

206
00:11:43.150 --> 00:11:44.920
because just four years later,

207
00:11:45.290 --> 00:11:48.400
Siman found himself in dire need of more help.

208
00:11:48.750 --> 00:11:51.960
This time his trouble started with the outbreak of a border dispute between

209
00:11:51.961 --> 00:11:53.560
Innsbrook and Venice, frankly,

210
00:11:53.590 --> 00:11:56.760
calling it a border dispute is putting it rather mildly.

211
00:11:56.761 --> 00:12:00.640
After noticing that the Venetian military was occupied in a fight with Turkish

212
00:12:00.641 --> 00:12:04.400
forces in Greece, Seaman's launched a modest opportunist attack,

213
00:12:04.401 --> 00:12:07.960
claiming a small Alpine town and extending the Austrian borders.

214
00:12:07.980 --> 00:12:11.400
It probably goes without saying that Venice wasn't terribly happy about this.

215
00:12:11.550 --> 00:12:14.190
They issued theirs sponsor in no uncertain terms.

216
00:12:14.710 --> 00:12:18.150
Sigmans could either return the town and pay a hundred thousand Florence in

217
00:12:18.151 --> 00:12:19.550
restitution for his bravado,

218
00:12:19.810 --> 00:12:24.070
or he could prepare for VES to take back their town by force Sigman appealed to

219
00:12:24.071 --> 00:12:25.590
the family's regular financers,

220
00:12:25.690 --> 00:12:28.470
but no one was willing to lend him the money they refused,

221
00:12:28.570 --> 00:12:29.870
not because of his military action,

222
00:12:29.970 --> 00:12:33.500
but because he had already managed to run up massive debts that he hadn't yet

223
00:12:33.501 --> 00:12:34.660
repaid desperate.

224
00:12:34.680 --> 00:12:38.580
He returned to Yakup fogger where other bankers saw a risk Yakup saw an

225
00:12:38.581 --> 00:12:41.460
opportunity. He agreed to lend Sigmans the money he needed,

226
00:12:41.600 --> 00:12:44.180
but the interest on the deal was going to be massive.

227
00:12:44.480 --> 00:12:48.260
The contract stated that the loan was going to be repaid with more S silver from

228
00:12:48.450 --> 00:12:49.340
Sigmans minds.

229
00:12:49.520 --> 00:12:53.890
All output was to be sold to the foggers at an almost unthinkable discount until

230
00:12:53.891 --> 00:12:57.370
the loan was repaid. The focus could then turn around and sell that silver.

231
00:12:57.470 --> 00:13:01.490
And they stood to make what could safely be described as boatloads of cash,

232
00:13:01.870 --> 00:13:03.410
the deal wasn't without risks,

233
00:13:03.970 --> 00:13:06.690
cisman had already proven that he couldn't repay his regular bankers.

234
00:13:06.691 --> 00:13:08.370
And that was the very real possibility.

235
00:13:08.470 --> 00:13:10.610
He would simply stop sending silver to the focus,

236
00:13:10.870 --> 00:13:15.320
but Yerba banked on the fact that this was a bridges didn't want to burn

237
00:13:15.680 --> 00:13:15.830
gambling,

238
00:13:15.830 --> 00:13:20.480
that he would uphold his end of the deal in order to preserve the possibility of

239
00:13:20.481 --> 00:13:21.400
future partnerships.

240
00:13:21.840 --> 00:13:26.040
It was a little bit about honor ands a lot about knowing he would need to borrow

241
00:13:26.041 --> 00:13:30.880
money again in the future. And it all came up rather shiny for YAB so shiny.

242
00:13:30.980 --> 00:13:33.920
In fact that the fogs opens their first branch office into roll.

243
00:13:34.060 --> 00:13:38.910
And it it's important to stress that this was a gamble on more than just C's

244
00:13:38.911 --> 00:13:40.910
ability or desire to uphold his end.

245
00:13:40.910 --> 00:13:44.590
The bargain metal allergy had been a work in progress for thousands of years.

246
00:13:44.730 --> 00:13:48.510
The evolution of the ages of men are defined by advancements in the use of

247
00:13:48.710 --> 00:13:49.990
materials like bronze and iron.

248
00:13:49.991 --> 00:13:53.510
After all at the time YAB was making deals for silver,

249
00:13:53.690 --> 00:13:58.020
but the corresponding smelting technologies had stalled starting around 1480

250
00:13:58.021 --> 00:14:01.740
though. Met allergic advancements began happening in leaps and bounds.

251
00:14:01.800 --> 00:14:05.700
It was becoming much more economical to separate silver from other materials in

252
00:14:05.860 --> 00:14:07.380
turn the demand for silver bled,

253
00:14:07.381 --> 00:14:11.500
mercury and copper exploded Portugal in particular was buying huge amounts of

254
00:14:11.501 --> 00:14:12.940
copper for their ships and their weapons.

255
00:14:13.120 --> 00:14:17.130
And the figures were well positioned to capitalize on it all in 1494,

256
00:14:17.450 --> 00:14:20.290
Jacob formed the family's first public company, a mining consortium.

257
00:14:20.510 --> 00:14:22.730
His goal was a copper monopoly to get there.

258
00:14:22.731 --> 00:14:24.770
He started investing heavily in copper mining,

259
00:14:24.990 --> 00:14:28.890
buying everything from mines to smelting plants across present day Slovakia.

260
00:14:29.040 --> 00:14:32.810
It's impossible to tell just how massive this portion of their industry was.

261
00:14:32.811 --> 00:14:35.850
As they were incredibly secretive. When it came to the technology, they,

262
00:14:36.840 --> 00:14:39.120
the numbers they saw floating across their accounts.

263
00:14:39.220 --> 00:14:42.760
We do know that it wasn't long before they had built up a massive trading empire

264
00:14:42.761 --> 00:14:45.040
that stretched from England to India and Africa.

265
00:14:45.300 --> 00:14:49.320
It was an industry that sustains the family wealth well into the 16th century

266
00:14:55.900 --> 00:14:58.600
In 1491, Yakima made another wise decision,

267
00:14:58.780 --> 00:15:00.720
the organized alone to Maximilian the first,

268
00:15:00.820 --> 00:15:04.840
the son of Frederick II when Maximilian became a ruler in his own right after

269
00:15:04.841 --> 00:15:06.720
his father's death in 1493,

270
00:15:07.150 --> 00:15:12.110
that cemented yaks continued standing as a banker to powerful and not so rich

271
00:15:12.210 --> 00:15:16.790
men of the 15th and 16th centuries that alongside the a mentioned investments

272
00:15:16.820 --> 00:15:20.630
into a burgeoning mining industry meant that the Foggo family coffers were

273
00:15:20.870 --> 00:15:24.270
filling fast. Still yak was always on the lookout for the next big deal.

274
00:15:24.370 --> 00:15:27.230
The trades came in faster and faster by 1503,

275
00:15:27.550 --> 00:15:30.270
they'd got an into the lucrative spice straight, only five years later,

276
00:15:30.300 --> 00:15:32.660
they were leasing in Roman among the coins.

277
00:15:32.661 --> 00:15:35.020
They were in charge of minting with those, for the Vatican.

278
00:15:35.021 --> 00:15:38.180
They kept that particular little side business until 1524.

279
00:15:38.400 --> 00:15:42.500
And here's where it's worth mentioning one endeavor in particular in

280
00:15:42.501 --> 00:15:43.460
15 14,

281
00:15:43.460 --> 00:15:46.860
1 of the most powerful positions in the church and in the political world became

282
00:15:46.861 --> 00:15:49.500
available. It was for the Archbishop of Maines,

283
00:15:49.660 --> 00:15:53.210
a high ranking position in Germany only to the emperor himself.

284
00:15:53.310 --> 00:15:55.210
The Pope at the time was Leo. The 10th,

285
00:15:55.230 --> 00:15:58.050
the malware name might not sound particularly familiar.

286
00:15:58.390 --> 00:16:01.530
His birth name will Giovanni deci.

287
00:16:01.790 --> 00:16:04.810
His reign as Pope is still known as one of the most extravagant.

288
00:16:04.811 --> 00:16:06.490
He was known as a patron of the arts.

289
00:16:06.500 --> 00:16:10.330
Since that's putting it politely elected to the papacy in 1530,

290
00:16:10.470 --> 00:16:11.850
at 37 years of age,

291
00:16:12.140 --> 00:16:15.480
he made it his mission to elevate the Vatican into something divine.

292
00:16:15.660 --> 00:16:18.960
In order to collect the enormous sum of money he needed to renovate the holy

293
00:16:18.990 --> 00:16:22.960
city. He started doing some shady things that most about Catholics.

294
00:16:22.970 --> 00:16:27.160
Absolutely didn't agree with like selling holy positions within the church.

295
00:16:27.500 --> 00:16:30.960
The position of Archbishop of Maines was one that was up for sale.

296
00:16:31.020 --> 00:16:35.750
And anyone who wanted to buy away into the seat was going to have to pay up how

297
00:16:35.751 --> 00:16:37.470
much well adjusted for inflation.

298
00:16:37.490 --> 00:16:41.150
It would cost the equivalent of about 4.8 million in today's money.

299
00:16:41.330 --> 00:16:44.710
It was alre of H who was determined to have it.

300
00:16:44.850 --> 00:16:47.910
And he turns Deak forgo for financing. YAB agreed.

301
00:16:48.190 --> 00:16:50.950
And he deposited the money right into the boats person or bank accounts.

302
00:16:51.110 --> 00:16:54.100
And well, I guess you can at least bar the openness of it all.

303
00:16:54.740 --> 00:16:58.180
Albach got the position, but now he had a hefty loan that he needed to repay.

304
00:16:58.360 --> 00:17:02.260
And how on earth was he gonna do that? Well, like most of Jacob's deals,

305
00:17:02.360 --> 00:17:03.260
it was complicated.

306
00:17:03.600 --> 00:17:07.300
And there were a few players in place with the support of the pube.

307
00:17:07.860 --> 00:17:11.820
Albrecht started selling indulgences or get out of jail free cards for heaven.

308
00:17:12.280 --> 00:17:16.610
The idea was that anyone willing to make a sizable donation to the church would

309
00:17:16.640 --> 00:17:20.570
have their sins immediately erased and their way into heaven paved.

310
00:17:20.780 --> 00:17:23.890
Presumably with the silver ends copper from ya's minds,

311
00:17:23.891 --> 00:17:26.010
perhaps to make the tale even more believable.

312
00:17:26.030 --> 00:17:29.530
The church arranged for the sale of indulgences while claiming all the money was

313
00:17:29.531 --> 00:17:33.170
paying for some much needed work on some Peter's Basilica. In reality,

314
00:17:33.171 --> 00:17:35.960
half of the money went to the, the pops, the rest went ya.

315
00:17:36.210 --> 00:17:38.440
There were some major consequences though.

316
00:17:38.441 --> 00:17:42.200
Deep sale of indulgences were so unthinkable to some Catholics that they decided

317
00:17:42.220 --> 00:17:46.440
it was worth breaking from the church over Martin Luther's 95 thesis were kick

318
00:17:46.800 --> 00:17:49.040
started by outer age, over the selling of indulgences.

319
00:17:49.130 --> 00:17:51.560
Eventually leading to the Protestant reformation.

320
00:17:52.040 --> 00:17:55.920
That sequence of events is pretty much a perfect example of Yakup fog's

321
00:17:55.921 --> 00:18:00.120
influence. He may not be a name that everyone recognizes in the 21st century,

322
00:18:00.420 --> 00:18:03.840
but thanks to his financial support of powerful Kings and clergymen across

323
00:18:03.841 --> 00:18:06.960
Europe, he completely rewrote world history,

324
00:18:13.710 --> 00:18:16.670
Yakob foggers wheelings and dealings. Aren't too many to list.

325
00:18:16.730 --> 00:18:20.470
So perhaps a better way to talk about the lasting impact he had on the world.

326
00:18:20.640 --> 00:18:24.350
Isn't to talk about how much money he made, but rather how he spent it.

327
00:18:24.560 --> 00:18:27.870
Let's take the fogger eye in 15, 17, YAB oversaw.

328
00:18:27.871 --> 00:18:31.980
The grounds breaking of would be a global first after years spent a massing,

329
00:18:31.981 --> 00:18:35.380
a fortune larger than a single person could spend in our lifetime. ER,

330
00:18:35.381 --> 00:18:37.540
wanted to give back to the community to that end.

331
00:18:37.560 --> 00:18:42.060
He built a housing complex school. The fogi it's located in Augsburg Germany,

332
00:18:42.240 --> 00:18:46.540
and it's entirely accurate to describe it as a city within a city opens in 1520,

333
00:18:46.640 --> 00:18:49.420
it was designed to provide housing to low income tenants.

334
00:18:49.690 --> 00:18:53.250
It included 147 apartments, 67 houses and a church.

335
00:18:53.540 --> 00:18:56.610
Those who lived there back to apply and meet specific criteria,

336
00:18:57.080 --> 00:19:01.130
that to prove their devotion to the Roman Catholic faith have no outstanding

337
00:19:01.280 --> 00:19:01.630
debt,

338
00:19:01.630 --> 00:19:05.210
be struggling to make ends meet and to have lived in Bavaria for two years.

339
00:19:05.590 --> 00:19:07.010
And what were the bonuses? Well,

340
00:19:07.011 --> 00:19:11.840
rent was just 88 cents a year and three present day. That's impressive,

341
00:19:11.900 --> 00:19:14.480
but what's more impressive is that 500 years later,

342
00:19:14.580 --> 00:19:18.680
the fogi still welcomes tenants who are in need and the rent has remained

343
00:19:18.850 --> 00:19:20.280
absolutely unchanged.

344
00:19:20.660 --> 00:19:24.560
The effects that yak of fogger and indeed the fogger family had on the world is

345
00:19:24.561 --> 00:19:29.000
impossible to trace and that some things that we only have time to mention in

346
00:19:29.020 --> 00:19:31.710
tidbit form after Maxima Julian's death in 15,

347
00:19:32.030 --> 00:19:33.910
19 yak of support of Spain's Charles,

348
00:19:34.110 --> 00:19:37.590
I first led to the Hapsburg ruler becoming the holy Roman emperor,

349
00:19:37.591 --> 00:19:40.430
Charles I fifth Yakup also loaned a large sum of money,

350
00:19:40.830 --> 00:19:45.350
fer and Magellan who took that money and set off on his famous expedition to,

351
00:19:45.430 --> 00:19:46.350
I can navigate the globe,

352
00:19:46.540 --> 00:19:50.390
even set up a new service in which he was sent letters from around the world,

353
00:19:50.391 --> 00:19:51.060
updating him,

354
00:19:51.060 --> 00:19:54.740
him on the economic and political situation in all his areas of interest.

355
00:19:54.740 --> 00:19:58.340
Essentially it was a newspaper before the newspapers were even a thing.

356
00:19:58.820 --> 00:20:01.500
The ends of the fo family came gradually in 15,

357
00:20:01.501 --> 00:20:03.940
12 yakka brought four of his nephews on board.

358
00:20:04.080 --> 00:20:07.340
He had no children of his own and he needed someone to pass the business onto

359
00:20:07.520 --> 00:20:10.460
it. Wasn't until 1525, that yak of the rich world,

360
00:20:10.461 --> 00:20:15.170
everything to his you an on with the stipulation that a brethren cousin would be

361
00:20:15.171 --> 00:20:20.130
kept on to advise him YAB died that same year while unrest swept across Hungary,

362
00:20:20.220 --> 00:20:24.530
still the business continued to grow and the firm reached its peak in 1546.

363
00:20:24.720 --> 00:20:28.570
They continued to establish charitable organizations like a foundation for the

364
00:20:28.571 --> 00:20:29.610
treatment of smallpox.

365
00:20:29.670 --> 00:20:33.360
But the very thing that had allowed YAB to become one of the richest men in the

366
00:20:33.361 --> 00:20:36.320
world was the same thing that led to the families downfall.

367
00:20:36.390 --> 00:20:40.800
They were so closely tied to the Hapsburgs and the fortunes of Hungary that as

368
00:20:40.801 --> 00:20:41.640
trade worsened.

369
00:20:41.820 --> 00:20:46.720
So did the family's financial opportunities by 1552 years after their withdrawal

370
00:20:46.721 --> 00:20:48.480
from the Hungarian trade market,

371
00:20:48.810 --> 00:20:53.080
Anton fogger told his sons to focus on their education and find their own

372
00:20:53.081 --> 00:20:54.440
fortunes. In the courts of Europe,

373
00:20:54.570 --> 00:20:59.320
their Spanish branch was bankrupt by 1557 and after Anton's death in

374
00:20:59.321 --> 00:21:04.120
1560 other branches that had become unprofitable were sold leases on mines,

375
00:21:04.121 --> 00:21:08.070
were it? And the family withdrew from Spain and in 1658,

376
00:21:08.250 --> 00:21:12.510
the firm was dissolved completely. It may have been the end of a dynasty,

377
00:21:12.530 --> 00:21:16.750
but the fogger family influence has lasted much longer than their fortune.

378
00:21:17.410 --> 00:21:19.470
