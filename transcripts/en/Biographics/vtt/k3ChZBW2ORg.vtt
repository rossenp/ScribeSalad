00:00:00.020 --> 00:00:04.080
<v 0>His image has become iconic. The thin bearded aesthetic religious leader,</v>

2
00:00:04.260 --> 00:00:08.920
who had turned to one Western friendly country into a theocratic regime and a

3
00:00:08.921 --> 00:00:13.320
rogue state I'm of course talking about I Ru must of Harvey.

4
00:00:14.080 --> 00:00:17.120
Koman the Supreme leader of the Iranian revolution

5
00:00:23.300 --> 00:00:24.010
From Iran.

6
00:00:24.010 --> 00:00:28.350
He would incite Iranians and Muslims around the world to oppose the great Satan

7
00:00:28.780 --> 00:00:33.670
America and America reciprocated this favor by imposing draconian sanctions

8
00:00:33.730 --> 00:00:35.910
on Iran. And by isolating the country,

9
00:00:36.330 --> 00:00:41.220
pop culture also played its part by elevating Koman and the Iranians to you.

10
00:00:41.360 --> 00:00:45.100
The status of top world, bad guys in second place.

11
00:00:45.330 --> 00:00:48.380
Only after the Soviets. Now, if you grow up in the 1980s,

12
00:00:48.381 --> 00:00:52.100
you're probably familiar with the faceless pilots taken down by Tom Maverick

13
00:00:52.580 --> 00:00:55.420
cruise in the movie, top gun. They fly Meg fighter jets,

14
00:00:55.421 --> 00:00:56.540
but they're not Soviets.

15
00:00:56.880 --> 00:00:59.820
<v 1>So they have to be Iranians or maybe you have watched.</v>

16
00:00:59.821 --> 00:01:04.530
And re-watched the epic intro seek naked gun where Les Nielsen beats the crap

17
00:01:04.531 --> 00:01:06.170
out of a group of anti-American leaders,

18
00:01:06.171 --> 00:01:09.610
including an ITO sporting a Mohawk under his turban,

19
00:01:10.310 --> 00:01:12.010
or if you are a hopeless geek,

20
00:01:12.011 --> 00:01:16.490
can you surely remember that Batman issue when Koman hires the joker as Iranian

21
00:01:16.491 --> 00:01:20.130
ambassador to the UN so that he could kill the whole general assembly with

22
00:01:20.131 --> 00:01:21.010
poisoning gas,

23
00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:25.960
but he is not directed by Tony Scott May who rest in beast nor

24
00:01:25.961 --> 00:01:27.880
scripted by DC comics.

25
00:01:27.950 --> 00:01:31.880
This is why today we're going to look at the complex experiences that shaped K

26
00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:36.800
oman into becoming a leading Clara who went on to oppose the emperor of Iran

27
00:01:36.820 --> 00:01:40.000
and to become a revolutionary at the age of 79,

28
00:01:40.180 --> 00:01:45.110
we will also learn how his relationship with America in this situation was

29
00:01:45.111 --> 00:01:48.670
more ambiguous than both parties wanted us to believe.

30
00:01:54.970 --> 00:01:59.750
<v 0>The man who would become known as I holo Romani was born Ru Mr. Fave MUA,</v>

31
00:02:00.010 --> 00:02:03.260
the youngest of six siblings. His date of birth is dispute did,

32
00:02:03.261 --> 00:02:07.100
but we are gonna settle for this video on the 24th of September, 1902.

33
00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:12.220
And his place of birth was town in what was then the kingdom of Persia,

34
00:02:12.221 --> 00:02:15.660
which later became Iran like the majority of the population in Iran.

35
00:02:15.661 --> 00:02:20.380
He was born into a family of the sheer Muslim faith family who claimed to be

36
00:02:20.381 --> 00:02:25.050
descended from the prophet Muhammad Ru's father SI staffer Al Shahi

37
00:02:25.690 --> 00:02:30.250
Aloma was a high ranking cleric bearing the title of hiatal Islam.

38
00:02:30.510 --> 00:02:33.410
And let's make a quick stop here for one pronunciations,

39
00:02:33.710 --> 00:02:35.730
bit difficult in this one, please give me a break.

40
00:02:35.910 --> 00:02:40.010
And the second clarification we need to say who the sheers are and what the

41
00:02:40.011 --> 00:02:44.010
difference is between them and the majority Muslim sec, the sons, the,

42
00:02:44.280 --> 00:02:47.920
these two factions share many spiritual and religious practices as their schism

43
00:02:48.180 --> 00:02:52.240
was political in nature. After the death of Muhammad in 632,

44
00:02:52.241 --> 00:02:56.040
his advisor Abu backer became the first Califf or successor to the prophet

45
00:02:56.220 --> 00:02:58.080
tasked with leading the Islamic nation.

46
00:02:58.180 --> 00:03:01.680
But his leadership was challenged by the followers of Ali, the prophet's cousin,

47
00:03:01.820 --> 00:03:05.000
and son-in-law this latter faction originated the sheer sec.

48
00:03:05.001 --> 00:03:08.640
He believed that the leadership of the Islamic nation belongs to the direct

49
00:03:08.641 --> 00:03:10.880
descendants of the prophet. On the other hand,

50
00:03:10.881 --> 00:03:14.200
Sunni Muslims believe that the leadership of the community is not a birthright.

51
00:03:14.220 --> 00:03:18.400
It can, and it must be earned. And now let's look at religious type.

52
00:03:18.910 --> 00:03:23.390
A Mueller indicates a religious leader or a teacher in a madrassa or religious

53
00:03:23.391 --> 00:03:23.890
school.

54
00:03:23.890 --> 00:03:28.630
The horrific title of Hoja Islam or proof of Islam is given only

55
00:03:28.730 --> 00:03:32.510
to Hyat ranking scholars who once progressed to the next level are addressed as

56
00:03:32.670 --> 00:03:35.550
desire tos. And with that outta the way, let's get back to our story.

57
00:03:35.990 --> 00:03:39.500
When Raha was very small, his father died according on sources,

58
00:03:39.680 --> 00:03:42.860
he was still an infant, but according to CIA to classify documents,

59
00:03:43.040 --> 00:03:47.620
he was five years old. We also know for sure that Al's father was assassinated,

60
00:03:47.720 --> 00:03:50.660
but sources differ on how maybe the killer was a bandit,

61
00:03:50.680 --> 00:03:54.820
but the CIA source claims that he was killed by a local governor for taking part

62
00:03:54.840 --> 00:03:58.060
in the so-called Persian constitutional revolution of

63
00:04:00.250 --> 00:04:04.050
19 0 6, 8 16. Roha had to experience another trauma. When his mother also died,

64
00:04:04.270 --> 00:04:05.530
the oldest of the siblings,

65
00:04:05.690 --> 00:04:09.570
his brother mortaza then took charge of him and made sure that Roha continued

66
00:04:09.571 --> 00:04:13.490
the family tradition by studying in various Islamic schools. At 19,

67
00:04:13.810 --> 00:04:18.730
Roha traveled to a where he studied religion under ITO Arbor, Al Erie,

68
00:04:18.890 --> 00:04:21.200
a well known Islamic scholar in 1922,

69
00:04:21.520 --> 00:04:26.400
Raha followed H E to the Fay madrassa in qu Iran's intellectual

70
00:04:26.401 --> 00:04:28.200
center for Islamic studies here,

71
00:04:28.600 --> 00:04:30.520
Raha distinguished himself in a variety of studies,

72
00:04:30.570 --> 00:04:34.480
which would shape his political career, including ethics, philosophy, and law,

73
00:04:34.580 --> 00:04:37.320
all subjects that he would go on to teach in 1932,

74
00:04:37.720 --> 00:04:40.990
Raha married the daughter of a prominence CLE from the capital to a marriage,

75
00:04:40.991 --> 00:04:42.190
which gave him seven children.

76
00:04:42.530 --> 00:04:45.750
Two of which unfortunately died in infancy in 1937,

77
00:04:45.751 --> 00:04:48.110
his old master ITO Erie died.

78
00:04:48.210 --> 00:04:50.630
He continued to grow his reputation as a learned scholar,

79
00:04:50.690 --> 00:04:54.950
by becoming the assistant to another leading ITO who sane Barra JDI.

80
00:04:55.050 --> 00:04:58.470
It was around this period that he started to become known as Holloman

81
00:04:59.230 --> 00:05:02.460
committee's residence in com was mostly dead to teaching and studying,

82
00:05:02.520 --> 00:05:06.140
but it may have been at this stage that he started to develop a political

83
00:05:06.141 --> 00:05:08.860
concern. The mid 1930s were in fact,

84
00:05:08.920 --> 00:05:12.220
the years in which the SHA and SHA the king of Kings Raza,

85
00:05:12.290 --> 00:05:14.380
PLAR launched a series of reforms,

86
00:05:14.381 --> 00:05:16.820
which could have undermined the authority of the sheer clergy.

87
00:05:16.870 --> 00:05:20.420
These were things like opening the first university or emancipation women by

88
00:05:20.421 --> 00:05:24.490
demanding for that or veils to be discarded in 1944.

89
00:05:24.850 --> 00:05:28.970
Koman co-authored a book condemning VAHA who by then had abdicated in favor of

90
00:05:28.971 --> 00:05:31.450
his son, Muhammad Reza PLAR. But beyond that,

91
00:05:31.451 --> 00:05:34.330
we don't have any other anti-government activities on come's record.

92
00:05:34.550 --> 00:05:37.850
The only thing we know for certain is that throughout the 1940s and 1950s,

93
00:05:38.250 --> 00:05:41.570
Koman continued to teach gen QUM becoming a nationally renowned,

94
00:05:42.640 --> 00:05:45.520
an Islamic jurisprudence. It wasn't until 1962,

95
00:05:45.720 --> 00:05:49.720
that Koman would raise his voice and to become a scourge for the rule of the

96
00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:50.833
SHA,

97
00:05:56.340 --> 00:06:00.120
The sh and cha, or more simply just the SHA Mohamed Raza.

98
00:06:00.400 --> 00:06:03.400
PLAR RDA par in 1941, his father razor,

99
00:06:03.401 --> 00:06:07.760
just razor without the Moham had abdicated following a preemptive occupation of

100
00:06:07.761 --> 00:06:11.240
Iran by the UK and the USSR who wanted to prevent a German invasion.

101
00:06:11.580 --> 00:06:12.920
In August of 1953,

102
00:06:12.940 --> 00:06:16.400
the Shar was forced to flee by the supporters of prime minister Mohamed Moza

103
00:06:17.350 --> 00:06:19.710
Moza day had successfully nationalized oil production,

104
00:06:19.711 --> 00:06:22.430
which until now had been controlled by British companies.

105
00:06:22.580 --> 00:06:24.430
This of course did not make Britain happy,

106
00:06:24.750 --> 00:06:28.670
who sought assistance from the us to remove Moza deck from power and reinstate.

107
00:06:28.690 --> 00:06:32.790
The sharp formerly P Lai maintains the nationalization of oil production,

108
00:06:32.810 --> 00:06:33.870
but behind the scenes,

109
00:06:34.150 --> 00:06:36.750
he shared the profits with the us led international consortium.

110
00:06:37.210 --> 00:06:40.660
This is when the SHA became the strongest ally of the us in the middle east and

111
00:06:40.661 --> 00:06:42.620
central Asia. With the assistance of Washington,

112
00:06:42.680 --> 00:06:44.620
the SHA launched a white revolution,

113
00:06:44.660 --> 00:06:48.140
a reform program aimed at developing the country's infrastructure. Most of all,

114
00:06:48.141 --> 00:06:51.380
this was a program of modernization and westernization,

115
00:06:51.430 --> 00:06:54.900
which continued some of the work already started by RA senior,

116
00:06:55.240 --> 00:06:58.610
but nobody liked these reforms left w fair actions wanted more.

117
00:06:58.640 --> 00:07:02.530
They were wary of the Shas dependence from the us and were angered by the

118
00:07:02.650 --> 00:07:04.250
unequal distribution of all revenues.

119
00:07:04.390 --> 00:07:07.570
The religious conservative side criticized the reforms of being too radical.

120
00:07:08.330 --> 00:07:10.010
You really can't make everybody happy,

121
00:07:10.310 --> 00:07:13.970
but what brought everybody together in really hating the SHA was the corruption

122
00:07:14.070 --> 00:07:18.840
in his government and his reliance on autocratic rule and the power, the Sava,

123
00:07:19.100 --> 00:07:22.000
the feared secret police as descend escalated.

124
00:07:22.001 --> 00:07:25.960
So did the activities of the Sinn organization originally established stringed

125
00:07:25.961 --> 00:07:30.320
and funded with CIA support as confirmed by a Senate foreign relations committee

126
00:07:30.840 --> 00:07:31.673
reports at it peak,

127
00:07:31.740 --> 00:07:36.480
the S had formally recruited 15,000 many of whom also managed in formal

128
00:07:36.840 --> 00:07:41.150
spine networks, therefore permeating all of society in the early 1960s,

129
00:07:41.151 --> 00:07:43.630
both factions opposing the sharp, the secular left,

130
00:07:43.631 --> 00:07:46.670
and the conservative clerics who would've normally opposed each other,

131
00:07:46.740 --> 00:07:51.670
started to coalesce and found an inspiring leader in Koman who

132
00:07:51.770 --> 00:07:55.910
had by now escalated and ranks and become an I Toler by now more than 60,

133
00:07:55.940 --> 00:07:57.150
instead of retiring,

134
00:07:57.151 --> 00:08:00.940
like many of us would choose to do this respected religious scholar decided to

135
00:08:00.941 --> 00:08:05.420
risk everything to gain center stage in a budding revolutionary movement,

136
00:08:05.860 --> 00:08:10.780
KA outspoken opposition to the government escalated from 1962 to 1963

137
00:08:10.810 --> 00:08:12.780
with a series of speeches and pamphlets,

138
00:08:12.781 --> 00:08:15.500
which denounced the SHS latest proposed reforms,

139
00:08:15.501 --> 00:08:18.860
which included women's suffrage and the opening of public offices to the non

140
00:08:19.260 --> 00:08:23.370
shear, be minority, according to a declassified CIA reports,

141
00:08:23.371 --> 00:08:27.890
these activities were a concerted effort of the qu mus Kaman. Well,

142
00:08:28.250 --> 00:08:29.090
here's kind of a sch mark,

143
00:08:29.370 --> 00:08:33.250
a figurehead who had been put in place because the clergy believed they could

144
00:08:33.251 --> 00:08:36.850
control him and manipulate his operations in the early hours that the 5th of

145
00:08:36.850 --> 00:08:41.200
June, 1963, the came a knocking in Aqua Kaman was arrested.

146
00:08:41.460 --> 00:08:44.640
It happened during the month of Mahama holy period, dedicated to mourning,

147
00:08:44.641 --> 00:08:46.000
according to Islam, the outrage,

148
00:08:46.001 --> 00:08:49.400
it was immediate resulting in widespread riots with high casualties in the

149
00:08:49.520 --> 00:08:52.200
capital city of Toran and in the town of Cheraz.

150
00:08:52.460 --> 00:08:55.240
So was all of this in the Mueller's plans. You see,

151
00:08:55.241 --> 00:08:57.040
they wanted to make a puppet out of Koman,

152
00:08:57.140 --> 00:09:01.080
but they instead it created a Marty and a true revolutionary leader who would

153
00:09:01.081 --> 00:09:04.400
not let himself be controlled in November of 1963,

154
00:09:04.401 --> 00:09:07.360
while still under house arrest Koman did something unexpected.

155
00:09:07.460 --> 00:09:11.440
And certainly not in character with the commonly accepted view of him being a

156
00:09:11.720 --> 00:09:13.040
rapidly anti-American leader,

157
00:09:13.260 --> 00:09:17.350
he sent a message to the government using as a conduit professor KARE from the

158
00:09:17.351 --> 00:09:19.430
theology department at Tiran university,

159
00:09:19.600 --> 00:09:22.550
let's quote a piece from the very same CIA report.

160
00:09:23.030 --> 00:09:26.230
Kaman explained that he was not opposed to American interests in Iran.

161
00:09:26.250 --> 00:09:27.050
On the contrary,

162
00:09:27.050 --> 00:09:30.670
he thought the American presence was necessary as a counterbalance to Soviet and

163
00:09:30.671 --> 00:09:31.830
possibly British influence.

164
00:09:32.510 --> 00:09:36.220
Kaman also explained his belief in cooperation between Islam and other world

165
00:09:36.500 --> 00:09:39.780
religions, especially Christian them. So now you've gotta be wondering, well,

166
00:09:39.781 --> 00:09:42.340
what was Washington's response? And I'd like to tell you,

167
00:09:42.580 --> 00:09:46.220
but the next paragraph, well, it's been fairly heavily redacted.

168
00:09:48.920 --> 00:09:52.380
So with the us governments have been open to cooperating with the ITO.

169
00:09:52.940 --> 00:09:56.690
Another CIA memorandum issued in November of 1978. Sorry to jump ahead.

170
00:09:56.691 --> 00:10:01.410
So many years there is doubtful of KO's leadership skills suggesting that he may

171
00:10:01.411 --> 00:10:05.170
not be capable of controlling the revolution that he himself had sparked with

172
00:10:05.270 --> 00:10:08.970
the risk of either a leftist faction or a military dictatorship taking power

173
00:10:09.200 --> 00:10:13.410
over the sharp combined with the other comments about in BI a puppet of the qu

174
00:10:13.411 --> 00:10:17.080
Muellers. It sounds like the CIA and the governments in general were seriously

175
00:10:17.081 --> 00:10:21.200
underestimating this guy, whatever opinion the us government had of him.

176
00:10:21.201 --> 00:10:24.400
The ITO continued his rise as leader of the opposition.

177
00:10:24.401 --> 00:10:26.640
After being released in April of 1964,

178
00:10:26.660 --> 00:10:31.040
he resumed his incendiary sermons against the sharp by now PA Lavi.

179
00:10:31.100 --> 00:10:36.000
He had had enough and in November he expelled the ITO and his Exar began

180
00:10:42.540 --> 00:10:46.790
Initially Kaman settled in Turkey from where he continued his vocal attacks on

181
00:10:47.150 --> 00:10:51.950
PLAR calling him a porn of the us and Israel by 1965, the Turkish,

182
00:10:51.951 --> 00:10:54.390
they also had had enough and begged the shot to take him back.

183
00:10:54.550 --> 00:10:58.420
But Kaman preferred to settle in the city of Najaf for center of sheer

184
00:10:58.421 --> 00:11:00.220
scholarship in Iraq, it was here.

185
00:11:00.380 --> 00:11:04.540
The committee formulated his doctrine known as guardianship of the jut.

186
00:11:04.650 --> 00:11:07.700
This concept marks a departure from sheer founding principles.

187
00:11:07.701 --> 00:11:08.940
According to this doctrine,

188
00:11:08.941 --> 00:11:11.980
when the divinely inspired descendants of the prophet is absent,

189
00:11:12.540 --> 00:11:15.420
religious and political leadership of the community can be assumed by the

190
00:11:15.900 --> 00:11:19.370
jurist, the expert in Islamic. All, this is exactly what Keman was.

191
00:11:19.371 --> 00:11:23.730
So he was basically saying, it's totally okay if I become the leader of Iran,

192
00:11:23.910 --> 00:11:27.250
his absence from the country did not prevent him from stoking descent.

193
00:11:27.310 --> 00:11:30.570
The ITO took to recording his own sermons on audio cassettes,

194
00:11:30.571 --> 00:11:34.250
which were then smuggled into Iran. And by the way, if you are 20 or younger,

195
00:11:34.650 --> 00:11:37.810
an audio cassette was a plastic recording support about the size of a Blackberry

196
00:11:38.240 --> 00:11:41.280
in the could store up to two hours of music or speech on a magnetic tape.

197
00:11:41.660 --> 00:11:43.080
By the way, if you're under 20 or younger,

198
00:11:43.200 --> 00:11:45.920
a black brief phone was what your parents used to take calls from the office

199
00:11:45.940 --> 00:11:49.120
before they came to their senses. And if you're 20 or younger,

200
00:11:49.121 --> 00:11:54.080
and you're watching a 20 minute video about the ITO OMA, well, well done. You,

201
00:11:54.370 --> 00:11:59.000
where was I? Ah, yes, the tapes, these tapes found fertil ground,

202
00:11:59.010 --> 00:12:03.400
especially amongst the lower classes in the expanding urban centers and amongst

203
00:12:03.401 --> 00:12:04.480
university students,

204
00:12:04.481 --> 00:12:07.960
regardless whether they were left leaning or aligned to the religious, right?

205
00:12:08.100 --> 00:12:12.000
So you might be wondering now, well, what was his agenda point?

206
00:12:12.240 --> 00:12:17.190
A the IA Taylor opposed the Shas efforts to give equal rights to women point B.

207
00:12:17.290 --> 00:12:21.430
He opposed land reforms deemed ineffective in feeding the population

208
00:12:22.270 --> 00:12:24.830
C he wanted to free Iran from foreign influence,

209
00:12:24.840 --> 00:12:29.670
especially that of the us and USSR D he protested the inclusion

210
00:12:29.730 --> 00:12:32.030
of religious minorities in positions of power,

211
00:12:32.200 --> 00:12:34.820
especially the Baha and five.

212
00:12:34.821 --> 00:12:37.780
Finally Kaman was a vocal critic of the state of Israel,

213
00:12:37.781 --> 00:12:41.420
whom he accused of manipulating the sharp over the 1970s,

214
00:12:41.780 --> 00:12:43.980
descent against pal grew in its intensity.

215
00:12:44.620 --> 00:12:48.340
Kaman kept attacking him from DJA and the SHA may have taken his revenge in

216
00:12:48.500 --> 00:12:53.020
1977. In fact, Carman's first born son Mustafa died in mysterious circumstances.

217
00:12:53.240 --> 00:12:56.850
The was due to our heart in agar committee claims that Mustafa had been killed

218
00:12:57.030 --> 00:12:57.863
by the government

219
00:13:03.950 --> 00:13:05.130
In the late 1970s,

220
00:13:05.410 --> 00:13:08.330
CIN enjoyed a high standing amongst both conservative Muslims and the

221
00:13:08.331 --> 00:13:10.930
sympathizers of the, to dare the local communist party.

222
00:13:11.080 --> 00:13:14.800
When on the 7th of January, 1978, a state controlled newspaper question,

223
00:13:14.860 --> 00:13:16.080
the ITO as patriotism,

224
00:13:16.100 --> 00:13:19.760
and even as sexuality protestors marched in the streets of Tiran,

225
00:13:19.860 --> 00:13:23.640
the police filed on them and violence escalated dis marked the official

226
00:13:23.641 --> 00:13:27.560
beginning of the Iranian revolution for the following 13 months, the police,

227
00:13:27.580 --> 00:13:30.840
the armed forces and the faced protestors across the country,

228
00:13:30.841 --> 00:13:35.310
killing them in the dozens or the hundreds as customer in Shia Islam.

229
00:13:35.550 --> 00:13:38.150
Each massacre was celebrated by a morning period of 40 days,

230
00:13:38.151 --> 00:13:42.030
followed by demonstrations. Violence would erupt again and so on.

231
00:13:42.031 --> 00:13:45.790
And in 40 days cycles Iran spiraled into chaos.

232
00:13:46.250 --> 00:13:49.150
The SHA who by now was suffering from late stage cancer,

233
00:13:49.250 --> 00:13:52.630
had little resolved to address the situation. Meanwhile, in Iraq,

234
00:13:53.230 --> 00:13:54.110
Coman continued to rally.

235
00:13:54.110 --> 00:13:58.180
The opposition that had is until Saddam Husein finally expelled him from Najaf

236
00:13:58.320 --> 00:14:01.020
the ITO. He moved to the outskirts of Paris. And from there,

237
00:14:01.021 --> 00:14:04.260
he planned his return as a triumphant leader of the revolutionary struggle.

238
00:14:04.360 --> 00:14:08.020
And apparently it was from France that he made his second attempt to seek an

239
00:14:08.220 --> 00:14:10.860
Alliance, or at least an understanding with the us.

240
00:14:11.280 --> 00:14:15.060
The aim of his messages was to reassure the us that a change in leadership in

241
00:14:15.061 --> 00:14:18.370
Iran compromise their access to crude oil. In exchange the,

242
00:14:18.371 --> 00:14:22.250
I asked the us government to use their influence to hold back the army from

243
00:14:22.251 --> 00:14:26.210
launching a coup. So did Carta comply? Well, this is not clear.

244
00:14:26.530 --> 00:14:29.650
It is true that the military eventually did not oppose the revolution,

245
00:14:29.651 --> 00:14:33.250
but this may have been due to simple opportunism in January, 1979,

246
00:14:33.251 --> 00:14:37.360
the Sharons family, they left Iran officially to take vacation, but in reality,

247
00:14:38.160 --> 00:14:40.440
uh, this was voluntary exile on the 1st of February,

248
00:14:40.680 --> 00:14:45.520
I OMA returned to run welcomed as a victorious leader by the crowd,

249
00:14:45.521 --> 00:14:48.480
following a referendum on the 1st of April, 1979,

250
00:14:48.750 --> 00:14:53.200
Iran officially became an Islamic Republic and Koman became the Supreme leader

251
00:14:53.380 --> 00:14:54.840
of this, the cratic state.

252
00:14:55.020 --> 00:14:59.920
It was the end of more than 2000 years of monarchy in Persia and

253
00:15:00.030 --> 00:15:00.863
Iran.

254
00:15:06.700 --> 00:15:10.200
So before I continue with the momentous events of the 1980s,

255
00:15:10.510 --> 00:15:13.350
give you an example of how Koman now empower,

256
00:15:13.460 --> 00:15:17.950
applied his doctrine of the guardianship of the jut. So the new constitution,

257
00:15:18.050 --> 00:15:22.270
it declared Shia Islam to beat the official religion of Iran being the faith of

258
00:15:22.271 --> 00:15:23.510
90% of the population.

259
00:15:23.570 --> 00:15:26.950
It also acknowledges minority groups as official religions, such as Sony,

260
00:15:26.951 --> 00:15:30.310
Muslims, Christianity, Zoro AISM, and even Judaism,

261
00:15:30.400 --> 00:15:34.140
which is surprising considering come's anti Zionist stance. However,

262
00:15:34.400 --> 00:15:38.580
the constitution excluded the Baha faith, making it effectively illegitimate.

263
00:15:38.840 --> 00:15:43.460
And this is not surprising seeing as how the Shas pro Baha policy was one of the

264
00:15:43.461 --> 00:15:46.500
many reforms that triggered koi into joining the opposition.

265
00:15:46.600 --> 00:15:50.540
The Baha religion formed as an offshoot of shear Islam in the mid 19th century.

266
00:15:50.720 --> 00:15:55.650
And it was view as her by many senior Muellers after the rise of

267
00:15:56.090 --> 00:15:56.910
Romania Supreme leader,

268
00:15:56.910 --> 00:16:01.610
up to 20,000 Baha worshipers fled the country to avoid persecution imprisonment,

269
00:16:01.830 --> 00:16:04.130
or even execution by May, 1983,

270
00:16:04.131 --> 00:16:08.530
at least 150 Baha men and women had been hanged or shot by the revolutionary

271
00:16:08.531 --> 00:16:09.150
government.

272
00:16:09.150 --> 00:16:14.080
The persecution of the Baha is just one of the repressive nature of

273
00:16:14.081 --> 00:16:18.080
this revolutionary regime. First, his regime ousted from positions of power,

274
00:16:18.180 --> 00:16:19.800
the former secular allies.

275
00:16:19.990 --> 00:16:23.120
Then it took political vengeance with hundreds of people who had worked for the

276
00:16:23.480 --> 00:16:25.160
Shaz regime, reportedly being executed.

277
00:16:25.260 --> 00:16:27.960
The remaining domestic opposition was then suppressed its members being

278
00:16:27.961 --> 00:16:30.000
systematically imprisoned or killed.

279
00:16:30.030 --> 00:16:32.480
Iranian women were also required to wear the,

280
00:16:32.630 --> 00:16:34.550
a Western music and alcohol were bands.

281
00:16:34.570 --> 00:16:37.750
And the punishments prescribed by Sharia law were reinstated.

282
00:16:38.070 --> 00:16:41.830
A new armed force that passed on would make sure that all aspects of Sharia law

283
00:16:41.831 --> 00:16:44.430
would be strictly enforced. The power is grown over time,

284
00:16:44.431 --> 00:16:47.710
sort of becoming a parallel police army and air force with a strict focus on

285
00:16:47.900 --> 00:16:51.590
enforcing Sharia law and defending the values of the Islamic revolution.

286
00:16:51.690 --> 00:16:55.540
So the question really is anything really changed since the times of the SAAC.

287
00:17:01.880 --> 00:17:05.380
The first years of a revolutionary governments are the most delicate ones,

288
00:17:05.381 --> 00:17:08.380
but the Islamic Republic survived two major trials.

289
00:17:08.680 --> 00:17:13.380
The us embassy hostage crisis, and the war with Iraq on the 22nd of October,

290
00:17:14.030 --> 00:17:16.530
was allowed entrance into the us to be treated for cancer.

291
00:17:16.870 --> 00:17:20.330
On the 4th of November, a mob of some 3000 protestors,

292
00:17:20.331 --> 00:17:24.810
mostly university students stormed the us embassy in Iran and took hostage about

293
00:17:24.820 --> 00:17:28.770
63 staff members. And what was Kim's involvement in this crisis? Well,

294
00:17:28.840 --> 00:17:32.770
very little, actually the storming was a result of a spontaneous demonstration.

295
00:17:32.870 --> 00:17:36.120
So he had no idea that it take place and he probably could have done without it,

296
00:17:36.180 --> 00:17:37.600
but once he started, well,

297
00:17:37.620 --> 00:17:40.440
he sort of got along with it and offered support to the protestors.

298
00:17:40.540 --> 00:17:42.760
It was in fact, during November of 1979,

299
00:17:42.761 --> 00:17:44.600
that he first started using in his speeches.

300
00:17:44.601 --> 00:17:49.480
His now infamous phrase to describe the us Americans are the great Satan,

301
00:17:49.820 --> 00:17:51.000
the wounded snake,

302
00:17:51.180 --> 00:17:54.880
but his government still had to negotiate with Satan talks with the Carter

303
00:17:54.881 --> 00:17:59.320
administration dragged on for months with Iran demanding that the Shas financial

304
00:17:59.321 --> 00:18:02.560
assets in the us be returned to the country in exchange for the hostages.

305
00:18:02.740 --> 00:18:06.640
The us in reply froze all Iranian assets and filed a lawsuit with the

306
00:18:06.641 --> 00:18:09.270
international court of justice in a April,

307
00:18:09.270 --> 00:18:12.110
1980 Carter's administration authorized a military rescue operation,

308
00:18:12.111 --> 00:18:15.710
which became a failure before it had even started eight special forces.

309
00:18:15.740 --> 00:18:19.390
Helicopters had stealth entered Iran, but when three of them malfunctions,

310
00:18:19.410 --> 00:18:21.630
the mission was aborted. Sadly on the way back,

311
00:18:21.631 --> 00:18:24.750
one of these TROs crashed causing the death of eight servicemen.

312
00:18:24.890 --> 00:18:25.790
The secretary of states,

313
00:18:25.960 --> 00:18:30.940
Cyrus VA resigned as for Carter presidency was doomed in may the

314
00:18:31.140 --> 00:18:33.660
us and its allies. It imposed an embargo on Iran,

315
00:18:33.661 --> 00:18:36.580
but the governments of Tiran still played hardball in negotiations.

316
00:18:36.650 --> 00:18:40.140
What tipped the scale was the second calamity that Beel the young Republic,

317
00:18:40.520 --> 00:18:44.580
the start of the war with Iraq on the 22nd of September, 1980,

318
00:18:44.850 --> 00:18:48.820
realizing that Iran could not fight SU dam in the chokehold of a trade embargo.

319
00:18:49.300 --> 00:18:53.450
Kaman agreed to release the hostages on the 20th of January, 1981,

320
00:18:53.590 --> 00:18:57.610
the new us president Ronald Reagan had been inaugurated just 20 minutes earlier.

321
00:18:58.110 --> 00:19:01.330
The crisis had been resolved, but did had lasted too long,

322
00:19:01.350 --> 00:19:05.930
not to sour the already frosty relationship between Iran and the United States,

323
00:19:06.330 --> 00:19:09.290
their interactions. They remain hostile to this very day.

324
00:19:15.780 --> 00:19:17.280
For most of the 1980s,

325
00:19:17.281 --> 00:19:21.400
the Islamic Republic had to contend with a bloody war against Sadams regime.

326
00:19:21.740 --> 00:19:26.720
The Iran, Iraq war, the longest of the 20th century dragged on until July, 1988.

327
00:19:26.980 --> 00:19:31.430
And it combined horrors from both world wars because of it use of trench

328
00:19:31.431 --> 00:19:34.590
warfare, poison gas and bombings on civilian targets.

329
00:19:34.850 --> 00:19:38.110
The Iraqis war aim was to gain control over the Chatal Arab,

330
00:19:38.330 --> 00:19:41.350
the confluence of the river's Tigres and the Euphrates,

331
00:19:41.410 --> 00:19:42.710
the only access to the sea.

332
00:19:42.711 --> 00:19:46.750
They also had in mind to stop the spread of the shear Islamic revolution into

333
00:19:46.910 --> 00:19:50.790
their sunny secular state Cam's regime could not field in Army's modern

334
00:19:51.060 --> 00:19:52.380
mechanized as Sadams,

335
00:19:52.381 --> 00:19:55.740
who would enjoy support from the us and most sunny Arab countries.

336
00:19:55.850 --> 00:19:58.700
What they could offer though, was numbers and fanaticism.

337
00:19:59.180 --> 00:20:01.980
Thousands of boy soldiers were indoctrinated by Muellers,

338
00:20:01.981 --> 00:20:06.020
into launching suicidal human wave attacks armed only with a plastic key.

339
00:20:06.240 --> 00:20:09.220
The key that would open the gates to paradise after their death,

340
00:20:09.460 --> 00:20:11.850
as Martys of the revolution, but it turned is out.

341
00:20:12.050 --> 00:20:14.210
The human wave attacks do not make strategic progress.

342
00:20:14.580 --> 00:20:17.930
Toran was in dire need of more complex tactics and weapons systems,

343
00:20:18.310 --> 00:20:20.690
namely long range missiles, Kaman regime.

344
00:20:20.691 --> 00:20:24.650
It would procure them in 1985 in a way which shows how ambitious and confusing

345
00:20:24.670 --> 00:20:27.890
the us Iran relationship was the resulting mess.

346
00:20:27.891 --> 00:20:30.410
It became known as the Iran Contra affair,

347
00:20:30.411 --> 00:20:34.480
something you might have heard of Iran made the first step with a secret request

348
00:20:34.481 --> 00:20:37.880
to Washington to buy up to 1,500 long range missiles,

349
00:20:37.881 --> 00:20:40.200
president Reagan and his national security advisor.

350
00:20:41.040 --> 00:20:43.960
Robert McFarland saw a chance to kill two birds with one stone first grasp for

351
00:20:43.961 --> 00:20:46.880
the occasion to negotiate with Iran for the release of seven Americans taken

352
00:20:46.960 --> 00:20:50.880
hostage by he, the Lebanese sheer fighters, loyal Koman seconds,

353
00:20:51.440 --> 00:20:54.720
make some cash through the arm sales to funds the Contra anti communist

354
00:20:55.400 --> 00:20:58.840
insurgents in Nicaragua. Yes, it was pretty complicated along the way.

355
00:20:58.841 --> 00:21:01.960
Reagan and McFarland killed another bird called American rule of law.

356
00:21:01.961 --> 00:21:06.710
Their actions violated the trade embargo on Iran violated the presidential miss

357
00:21:06.711 --> 00:21:11.310
not to negotiate with terrorists and violated the recently pass Boland

358
00:21:11.750 --> 00:21:15.790
agreement, which forayed the government from intervening in Nicaragua. Wow.

359
00:21:16.250 --> 00:21:19.870
And that is why you've probably heard of the Iran Contra affair,

360
00:21:26.190 --> 00:21:28.660
But let's get back to the, even with venue missiles,

361
00:21:28.661 --> 00:21:33.660
the Iranians were not able to break the front line. The war ended in July, 1988,

362
00:21:33.800 --> 00:21:34.633
its a result.

363
00:21:34.900 --> 00:21:38.700
Well that was a costly sta mate between half a million and a million people had

364
00:21:38.701 --> 00:21:39.130
died.

365
00:21:39.130 --> 00:21:44.020
Half a million soldiers were crippled at 400 billion of damaged infrastructure

366
00:21:44.280 --> 00:21:47.460
was done for almost no gain Sudan in the end,

367
00:21:47.590 --> 00:21:51.810
got his outlet to the sea only to return it to Iran in 1991 in exchange for

368
00:21:51.811 --> 00:21:54.050
their neutrality during the first Gulf war,

369
00:21:54.270 --> 00:21:58.130
but actually Kaman and his regime that gained something from the conflict, Orbe,

370
00:21:58.250 --> 00:22:02.450
it, something immaterial the total war against an ethnically Arab Sonny secular

371
00:22:02.460 --> 00:22:07.090
enemy had consolidated the resolve and institutions of the young revolutionary

372
00:22:07.091 --> 00:22:07.924
government in a,

373
00:22:08.440 --> 00:22:13.280
that was non-A Shia and theocratic only a few months after the end of the war in

374
00:22:13.440 --> 00:22:16.320
February, 1989, the ITO deman made headlines again.

375
00:22:16.320 --> 00:22:20.800
When he issued a fatwa against writer, Salman Rushdi, accusing him of tinging.

376
00:22:20.801 --> 00:22:24.520
The name of the prophet Mohamed in his novel Satan versus a fatwa is a legal

377
00:22:24.760 --> 00:22:25.720
document issued by a mul,

378
00:22:25.730 --> 00:22:30.070
which in this case carried a death sentence against the writer and a monetary

379
00:22:30.090 --> 00:22:33.950
reward, Salman rushed. He was forced into hiding and to seek police protection,

380
00:22:34.350 --> 00:22:37.550
KA Amy's condemnation of the Satan versus though it was shortlived four months

381
00:22:37.551 --> 00:22:42.430
later in June of 1989 Koman he died regarded as a hero

382
00:22:42.610 --> 00:22:46.910
or condemned as the ultimate villain, both outside and within his country.

383
00:22:47.290 --> 00:22:51.940
His reputation as a ruthless who would not refrain from harming exiling or

384
00:22:51.941 --> 00:22:55.540
killing opponents to achieve his goal is certainly well deserved.

385
00:22:55.920 --> 00:22:59.500
But isn't that true of so many leaders around the Globes,

386
00:22:59.560 --> 00:23:03.660
wasn't that true for SHA PLAR himself or Saddam or Saudi Arabia.

387
00:23:04.080 --> 00:23:08.060
And yet they did and still do have the support of America.

388
00:23:08.640 --> 00:23:13.050
And the west Kaman did open himself up to America on at least two occasions and

389
00:23:13.051 --> 00:23:16.090
he may have been ignored or underestimated. On the other hand,

390
00:23:16.110 --> 00:23:19.610
the Iran Contra affair could have been the occasion to haw the frost,

391
00:23:19.790 --> 00:23:21.130
but it seems like Kamas.

392
00:23:21.210 --> 00:23:25.210
I advised decision to back the protestors during the hostage crisis had made his

393
00:23:25.211 --> 00:23:27.930
relationship with America, impossible to men.

394
00:23:28.510 --> 00:23:33.360
Now professor MCM SA of Tiran university espouses a geopolitical

395
00:23:33.361 --> 00:23:33.641
theory,

396
00:23:33.641 --> 00:23:38.600
according to which America and Iran should not antagonize each other as Tiran is

397
00:23:38.601 --> 00:23:42.720
the natural ally of the us in the region of footholds in this country would

398
00:23:42.721 --> 00:23:45.480
provide access to central Asia, the Gulf and its resources.

399
00:23:45.700 --> 00:23:48.400
It was the case in the past and who knows,

400
00:23:48.490 --> 00:23:51.840
maybe it will happen again in the future, but at least for the past 40 years,

401
00:23:52.400 --> 00:23:56.160
us and Dran foreign policy seems to have missed the trick.

402
00:23:56.540 --> 00:23:59.640
So I really hope you found that video. Interesting. If you did,
