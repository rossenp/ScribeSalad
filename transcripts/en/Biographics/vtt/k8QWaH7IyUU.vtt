Without a doubt.

9
00:00:30.431 --> 00:00:34.710
One of the most exciting periods in history was the industrial revolution that

10
00:00:34.711 --> 00:00:35.710
perhaps no other time,

11
00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:40.350
was there a greater feeling that the sky was the limit innovations happened one

12
00:00:40.360 --> 00:00:41.420
after another,

13
00:00:41.720 --> 00:00:46.020
and they all seemed destined to change the world forever assuredly.

14
00:00:46.040 --> 00:00:50.100
One of the most important novelties of the 19th century was the railway.

15
00:00:50.500 --> 00:00:54.380
It marked a decisive shift in how people could travel a world distances that

16
00:00:54.580 --> 00:00:58.180
previously seemed unreachable were now just a day or two away.

17
00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:02.650
And we might have never enjoyed this revolution without George Stevenson.

18
00:01:02.770 --> 00:01:07.450
A man absolutely named the father of the railways Stevenson was completely

19
00:01:07.451 --> 00:01:08.190
self-made.

20
00:01:08.190 --> 00:01:10.730
<v 1>He was a man born into a family of illiterates,</v>

21
00:01:10.731 --> 00:01:13.130
a man who couldn't read himself until he was 18.

22
00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:16.930
And he had to get his first job at the age of eight to help support his family.

23
00:01:17.230 --> 00:01:21.130
And yet he became one of the most successful and innovative engineers in British

24
00:01:21.160 --> 00:01:24.880
history and day. We are looking at his incredible story.

25
00:01:31.060 --> 00:01:33.240
<v 0>George Stevenson was born on June the ninth,</v>

26
00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:36.720
1781 in Wiam Northlands in English village,

27
00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:38.600
situated on the banks of the riverine.

28
00:01:38.860 --> 00:01:42.910
He was the second of six children to Robert and Mabel Steven and,

29
00:01:43.090 --> 00:01:46.750
and they all lived together in just one room of a house that contained three

30
00:01:46.751 --> 00:01:51.070
other families while was a coal town located just a few miles from Newcastle.

31
00:01:51.100 --> 00:01:55.710
Most blue collar laborers worked at the nearby collary as did George's father

32
00:01:55.711 --> 00:01:58.110
Robert or old Bob, as he was known in town.

33
00:01:58.170 --> 00:02:00.750
The Stevensons were well liked in the village. Mabel.

34
00:02:00.770 --> 00:02:05.140
The daughter of a dire from Ingham was as being a woman with a delicate

35
00:02:05.141 --> 00:02:07.140
constitution, but overall,

36
00:02:07.460 --> 00:02:10.980
a real canny body S Bob was popular with the local children.

37
00:02:11.040 --> 00:02:13.660
He used to gather by the engine fire as he was tending it.

38
00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:16.260
And listen to Bob tell stories. They were nice people,

39
00:02:16.360 --> 00:02:19.340
but they were completely uneducated. Both parents were illiterate.

40
00:02:19.341 --> 00:02:20.180
And so with the children,

41
00:02:20.181 --> 00:02:24.770
because the family was too poor to afford education for any of unsurprisingly

42
00:02:24.771 --> 00:02:25.770
under these conditions,

43
00:02:25.830 --> 00:02:29.890
it was expected that the boys would eventually join their father and work in a

44
00:02:29.891 --> 00:02:30.331
coal mine.

45
00:02:30.331 --> 00:02:34.050
George was eager to help out the family and got his first paying job when he was

46
00:02:34.051 --> 00:02:34.884
just eight years old,

47
00:02:35.070 --> 00:02:39.290
by then the Stevensons had moved dearly burn and old Bob worked at the coy

48
00:02:39.291 --> 00:02:41.610
there, young George or George, as he was called,

49
00:02:41.611 --> 00:02:43.170
found employments with his neighbor,

50
00:02:43.370 --> 00:02:47.360
a widow who intu pins a day to keep an on cows while they grazed and make sure

51
00:02:47.361 --> 00:02:49.160
that they didn't stray into the neighboring lands.

52
00:02:49.161 --> 00:02:51.960
It was easy work that afforded the boy lots of free time,

53
00:02:51.961 --> 00:02:54.640
which he dedicated to two of his favorite pursuits,

54
00:02:54.960 --> 00:02:58.520
watching birds and making engines out of clay. As he grew up,

55
00:02:58.521 --> 00:03:02.400
George took on more jobs on the farm until he was old enough to start working in

56
00:03:02.401 --> 00:03:06.560
the coal mine, alongside his father and elder brother, James by necessity.

57
00:03:06.560 --> 00:03:08.160
The Stevensons moved around a bit.

58
00:03:08.520 --> 00:03:12.040
Whenever a mine started to dry up into another one was open someplace else.

59
00:03:12.150 --> 00:03:15.840
However, George never found it difficult to secure a new job as he was hardwork

60
00:03:15.950 --> 00:03:17.680
conscientious and strong.

61
00:03:17.860 --> 00:03:21.350
<v 1>By the time a teenager, he fulfilled his ambition of becoming an engine. Man.</v>

62
00:03:21.370 --> 00:03:24.230
It was clear that George had a fascination with engines ever since his

63
00:03:24.231 --> 00:03:26.470
childhood. Now that he had his desired position.

64
00:03:26.690 --> 00:03:31.070
He worked every day with engines and took time to clean and study and understand

65
00:03:31.160 --> 00:03:32.910
every component. When he was 18.

66
00:03:32.911 --> 00:03:36.150
George Stevenson realized that there was a hard limit on how much he could learn

67
00:03:36.151 --> 00:03:39.620
without being able to read. So he sought to correct this floor.

68
00:03:39.720 --> 00:03:42.460
He used his MIGA salary and began attending night school.

69
00:03:42.520 --> 00:03:46.140
And by the time he was 19, he knew how to read and could also write his name.

70
00:03:46.410 --> 00:03:50.340
Then he moved on to a better, more expensive teacher who taught him arithmetic.

71
00:03:50.360 --> 00:03:53.620
<v 0>And George soon discovered that he had a talent for working with numbers.</v>

72
00:03:54.050 --> 00:03:56.060
This was George's life for several more years.

73
00:03:56.200 --> 00:03:59.340
He moved on from one mind to another being promoted.

74
00:03:59.730 --> 00:04:00.930
As he became more experienced,

75
00:04:01.110 --> 00:04:04.810
he met a woman named Francis Henderson and the two married in 1802.

76
00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:09.930
They had a son Robert a year later and of course Robert Stevenson would go on

77
00:04:09.931 --> 00:04:12.330
to become a great engineer in his own, right?

78
00:04:12.331 --> 00:04:14.090
Perhaps even greater than his father.

79
00:04:14.091 --> 00:04:18.650
Unfortunately George's life would be soon marked with tragedy in 1806,

80
00:04:18.890 --> 00:04:23.360
Francis died of tuber or consumption as he was called back then leaving him

81
00:04:23.361 --> 00:04:24.110
heartbroken.

82
00:04:24.110 --> 00:04:27.600
Then George left for Scotland for a while after securing a well paid position

83
00:04:27.601 --> 00:04:30.640
there, he saved up quite a bit of money, but when he returned,

84
00:04:30.641 --> 00:04:34.600
he discovered that his father had met a serious accident on the job after being

85
00:04:34.601 --> 00:04:36.520
struck with the steam blast of the face.

86
00:04:36.860 --> 00:04:39.880
The injury had left old Bob blind infirm and in poverty.

87
00:04:40.060 --> 00:04:43.870
George used most of his money to cover his father's debts and to secure a nice

88
00:04:43.871 --> 00:04:45.990
cottage for him to live out the rest of his days

89
00:04:52.210 --> 00:04:53.870
Before he got involved with railways,

90
00:04:53.871 --> 00:04:58.470
George Stevenson had another important invention to his credit. The safety lamp,

91
00:04:58.620 --> 00:05:00.990
this invention brought him into conflict with esteem.

92
00:05:01.660 --> 00:05:05.540
Scientists are Humphrey Davey over who had the better design and who came up

93
00:05:05.541 --> 00:05:08.780
with it first back in Stevenson's time, working in a coal mine,

94
00:05:08.900 --> 00:05:11.380
it was very dangerous. It still is to be fair.

95
00:05:11.381 --> 00:05:15.340
But back then explosions were a regular problem caused by build ups of various

96
00:05:15.420 --> 00:05:18.460
flamable gases, collectively referred to as fire amp.

97
00:05:18.900 --> 00:05:21.300
There was a big one in 1806 at the pit in west,

98
00:05:21.770 --> 00:05:24.610
or where Stevenson worked as Brisman, which killed 10 people.

99
00:05:25.030 --> 00:05:27.410
And George witnessed it firsthand by far,

100
00:05:27.411 --> 00:05:31.130
the most destructive disaster occurred at failing pits on may the 25th,

101
00:05:31.370 --> 00:05:36.170
18, 12 92 men and boys, some as young as 80 years old were killed in the blast.

102
00:05:36.310 --> 00:05:40.450
But this finally prompted demands that mining safety standards needed to change.

103
00:05:40.640 --> 00:05:42.560
What minors needed was a say safety lamp.

104
00:05:42.660 --> 00:05:46.200
One that would provide adequate light without having a naked flame that could

105
00:05:46.201 --> 00:05:47.120
trigger explosions.

106
00:05:47.470 --> 00:05:51.120
Ideally it would also alert the miners if they were in a dangerous situation

107
00:05:51.121 --> 00:05:53.960
with a lot of gas building up around them in 1815,

108
00:05:54.070 --> 00:05:57.120
they got not one but two such devices to choose from.

109
00:05:57.330 --> 00:06:01.880
There was the DVY lamp and there was Stevenson's Jordy lamp. By that point,

110
00:06:01.881 --> 00:06:05.440
Humphrey DVY had already been Knight and was considered one of the preeminent

111
00:06:05.680 --> 00:06:06.513
scientists in England.

112
00:06:06.580 --> 00:06:10.080
His safety lamp perceived a lot of attention and was quickly adopted throughout

113
00:06:10.081 --> 00:06:10.914
most of the country.

114
00:06:11.070 --> 00:06:14.720
That was except for the Northeast of England where the Jordy lamp was far more

115
00:06:14.721 --> 00:06:15.150
popular,

116
00:06:15.150 --> 00:06:18.990
perhaps out of a sense camaraderie as it was designed by one of their own.

117
00:06:19.060 --> 00:06:21.110
<v 1>Each lamp had its benefits and drawbacks.</v>

118
00:06:21.170 --> 00:06:24.750
The Davy lamp incase the flame in a screen made out of iron Gores while

119
00:06:24.900 --> 00:06:26.110
Stevenson used paper.

120
00:06:26.220 --> 00:06:29.830
<v 0>Therefore that Jordy lamp admitted a brighter light, but it was more fragile.</v>

121
00:06:30.310 --> 00:06:33.870
The more important distinction was that Stevenson's lamp had a separate inlet

122
00:06:33.871 --> 00:06:36.470
and exhaust the opening of the inlet could be adjusted.

123
00:06:36.490 --> 00:06:39.580
So that enough air needed to like the lamp would pass through.

124
00:06:39.880 --> 00:06:42.620
If the amount of fire dam began to increase to unsafe levels,

125
00:06:42.730 --> 00:06:46.380
then not enough air would enter the lamp. And the flame would simply extinguish.

126
00:06:46.570 --> 00:06:48.500
This would not only prevent an explosion,

127
00:06:48.501 --> 00:06:52.220
but also alert the miners that they were in a dangerous situation. However,

128
00:06:52.420 --> 00:06:56.180
a strong current could force a lot of air inside the lamp and greatly enlarge

129
00:06:56.181 --> 00:06:57.770
the flame, making the lamp to hot,

130
00:06:57.771 --> 00:07:00.370
to handle the world at large preferred the Davy lamp.

131
00:07:00.470 --> 00:07:04.490
Not necessarily because it was better, but because of who invented it. In fact,

132
00:07:04.730 --> 00:07:09.330
D and his supporters all accused Stevenson of stealing his design curiously Davy

133
00:07:09.331 --> 00:07:13.450
himself faced the same accusation from an Irish inventor named William Reed clan

134
00:07:13.550 --> 00:07:17.090
who built his version of a safety lamp in 18, 13,

135
00:07:17.090 --> 00:07:20.240
2 years before both other men, the clan lamp, however,

136
00:07:20.470 --> 00:07:23.920
used a bellows and a pair of water tanks to keep an isolated flame burning

137
00:07:23.940 --> 00:07:27.560
inside a metal case with a glass window. It was heavy on wily,

138
00:07:27.780 --> 00:07:30.280
dim and required a man to operate it continuously.

139
00:07:30.500 --> 00:07:32.920
So it was never used much in practice. Moreover,

140
00:07:32.921 --> 00:07:36.600
it was distinct enough from the other two lamps that nobody truly considered

141
00:07:36.601 --> 00:07:40.470
that Davy or Stevenson road, any design ideas from it.

142
00:07:40.570 --> 00:07:43.910
The world remembers Humphrey DVY as the inventor of the safety lamp. Indeed,

143
00:07:43.911 --> 00:07:47.750
the Royal society awarded him the Rumford med offer his efforts in 1816,

144
00:07:48.010 --> 00:07:50.070
as well as a 1000 pound prize.

145
00:07:50.460 --> 00:07:53.030
This was in addition to another 2000 pounds,

146
00:07:53.031 --> 00:07:56.670
which DVY received from the colory owners of England. Meanwhile,

147
00:07:56.690 --> 00:08:01.060
the same colory owners only gave Stevenson a hundred Gus. It was pretty clear.

148
00:08:01.120 --> 00:08:03.700
The scientific community of England signed with Davy.

149
00:08:03.810 --> 00:08:07.940
Many of them simply refused to believe that an uneducated working class man,

150
00:08:07.941 --> 00:08:12.180
like Stevenson could invent such a device by using only intuition,

151
00:08:12.400 --> 00:08:14.340
common sense and trial and error.

152
00:08:14.560 --> 00:08:18.220
And yet that's exactly what happens unhappy with the way their self-made

153
00:08:18.460 --> 00:08:19.970
engineer was treated. South.

154
00:08:20.210 --> 00:08:23.570
The Northern committee was formed in Newcastle to help determine priority for

155
00:08:23.571 --> 00:08:26.690
the safety lamp. In favor of Stevenson, they established a timeline.

156
00:08:27.370 --> 00:08:30.570
DVY presented his lamp to the Royal society on November the ninth, 1815,

157
00:08:30.870 --> 00:08:34.490
his earliest communication regarding the lamp was in a letter to a friend dated

158
00:08:34.491 --> 00:08:36.570
October the 30th. And yet on October,

159
00:08:36.571 --> 00:08:41.120
the 21st Stevenson had already begun using a modified oil lamp for early trials.

160
00:08:41.450 --> 00:08:42.480
Based on the evidence,

161
00:08:42.500 --> 00:08:46.680
the Newcastle committee raised another thousand pounds and awarded it to George

162
00:08:46.680 --> 00:08:47.840
Stevenson for his Jordy lamp.

163
00:08:48.140 --> 00:08:51.520
The most probable story is that neither man stole anything from the other.

164
00:08:51.630 --> 00:08:55.120
They just had similar ideas around the same time, even.

165
00:08:55.260 --> 00:08:59.600
So this experience spread a lifelong distrust of London intellectuals for

166
00:08:59.601 --> 00:09:01.800
Stevenson. He made sure to educate his son,

167
00:09:01.801 --> 00:09:04.840
Robert in a private school so that he would get rid of the thick Northern

168
00:09:04.870 --> 00:09:06.440
accents that his father had,

169
00:09:06.441 --> 00:09:09.920
which he believed negatively influenced other people's impression of him.

170
00:09:10.060 --> 00:09:13.000
Now you might not need to go to a private school to have your accent change,

171
00:09:13.060 --> 00:09:14.360
to make a good impression. Thus,

172
00:09:14.850 --> 00:09:18.110
if your business is on the internet today and it should be,

173
00:09:18.330 --> 00:09:20.510
you still need to make a good impression online.

174
00:09:20.530 --> 00:09:25.030
And you can do that with today's sponsor Squarespace, Squarespace empowers.

175
00:09:25.370 --> 00:09:28.630

176
00:09:28.770 --> 00:09:31.270
It empowers dreamers makers, doers.

177
00:09:31.490 --> 00:09:34.790
It gives them the tools to bring their creative ideas to life and square.

178
00:09:35.290 --> 00:09:37.820
Make it very easy to do. They have this all in one platform.

179
00:09:37.960 --> 00:09:40.900
You just go in there, you claim a domain, you build a website.

180
00:09:41.200 --> 00:09:43.500
If you wanna even sell something, you can do that too.

181
00:09:43.501 --> 00:09:46.860
There's no fussing around with getting a domain name from one place,

182
00:09:46.900 --> 00:09:49.420
bringing it over to another, linking it together,

183
00:09:49.480 --> 00:09:53.060
and then working out how you make a store integrate with your website on

184
00:09:53.061 --> 00:09:57.450
Squarespace. It's all done in one nice form. And that's a, all there is to it.

185
00:09:57.640 --> 00:10:01.290

197
00:10:39.490 --> 00:10:42.590
Around the same time that Stevenson began working on the safety lamp.

198
00:10:42.591 --> 00:10:47.150
He also designed and built his first steam locomotive while working at the

199
00:10:47.151 --> 00:10:49.070
Killingworth collary as engine, right?

200
00:10:49.071 --> 00:10:52.830
He already employed the use of stationary engines to improve the transport of

201
00:10:52.860 --> 00:10:57.220
coal, but he became convinced that a locomotive or traveling engine us,

202
00:10:57.221 --> 00:10:59.740
he called it back then would be even more efficient.

203
00:11:00.160 --> 00:11:03.260
He had plenty of inspiration because George Stevenson his nickname,

204
00:11:03.261 --> 00:11:04.540
the father of the railways,

205
00:11:04.650 --> 00:11:08.700
some people incorrectly assume that he built the very first steam locomotive,

206
00:11:08.800 --> 00:11:12.900
but that's not the case. That honor is usually given to British mining engineer,

207
00:11:12.930 --> 00:11:16.700
Richard Trevor thick on February the 21st 1804, his machine,

208
00:11:16.750 --> 00:11:20.090
which he never bothered to name, but became known as the penny.

209
00:11:20.370 --> 00:11:23.050
Darren locomotive made the first railway journey.

210
00:11:23.080 --> 00:11:25.010
Traveling nine miles from penny,

211
00:11:25.330 --> 00:11:28.330
Darren iron works to the mur Cardiff canal in south Wales.

212
00:11:28.850 --> 00:11:32.090
The engine never made it back because a bold she and the boiler leaked,

213
00:11:32.091 --> 00:11:37.010
but it did haul five wagons carrying 70 men and 10 tons of iron showing

214
00:11:37.410 --> 00:11:40.440
mine owners, every aware the potential for locomotives even.

215
00:11:40.500 --> 00:11:44.840
So Trevor fix machine proved to be too heavy and the rails couldn't support its

216
00:11:44.841 --> 00:11:45.220
weight.

217
00:11:45.220 --> 00:11:49.880
It wasn't until 1812 that John Blanken so designed and Matthew Murray built

218
00:11:50.440 --> 00:11:54.560
Sal man, the first practical and commercially successful steam locomotive,

219
00:11:54.580 --> 00:11:58.600
unsurprisingly, given his passion for engines. As soon as Stevenson heard of it,

220
00:11:58.700 --> 00:12:00.520
he wanted to build his own locomotive.

221
00:12:00.780 --> 00:12:04.240
He convinced the higher up at the Killingworth coy to fund his project.

222
00:12:04.800 --> 00:12:06.600
And on July the 21st, 18, 14,

223
00:12:06.780 --> 00:12:09.480
the first Stevenson locomotive made its made in voy.

224
00:12:09.780 --> 00:12:14.510
He named it blue share after PRUs and Jenn or Gahar Libra on Blucher

225
00:12:14.610 --> 00:12:17.670
who had recently defeat Napoleon at the battle of live RGS.

226
00:12:17.830 --> 00:12:21.830
A year later would go on to Baim Waterloo as well. The locomotive works,

227
00:12:21.890 --> 00:12:24.910
but it left a lot to be dessert. It was clunky jerky loud.

228
00:12:25.150 --> 00:12:26.270
And from a financial perspective,

229
00:12:26.650 --> 00:12:30.310
it was just about as economical as the traditional horse drawn carriages.

230
00:12:30.420 --> 00:12:34.260
Despite the floors Stevenson was allowed to keep working on new and improved

231
00:12:34.290 --> 00:12:38.340
designs. Unfortunately, blue share did not survive long as the engineer to it,

232
00:12:38.500 --> 00:12:41.900
to pieces and reused the parts to save on costs. In total.

233
00:12:41.901 --> 00:12:45.380
This is said that George Stevenson built 16 locomotives at Killingworth,

234
00:12:45.860 --> 00:12:47.340
although they are not well documented

235
00:12:53.530 --> 00:12:56.090
Following his project at Killingworth Stevenson,

236
00:12:56.091 --> 00:12:58.970
officially established himself as one of the top names in his field.

237
00:12:59.190 --> 00:13:02.170
He was next tasked not with designing a new locomotive,

238
00:13:02.310 --> 00:13:04.690
but with building a new railway. Sure.

239
00:13:04.750 --> 00:13:06.730
The locomotives were the ones that got all the attention,

240
00:13:06.870 --> 00:13:10.610
but the truth of the matter was that railways needed to be modernized as well.

241
00:13:10.710 --> 00:13:14.800
The old ones were generally made out of wood and they were simply not sturdy

242
00:13:14.801 --> 00:13:18.760
enough to handle the weight that could be transported by steam engines. In 18,

243
00:13:19.040 --> 00:13:23.480
19 Stevenson was asked to build an eight mile railroad for the hat and coy near

244
00:13:23.481 --> 00:13:25.240
Sunland. By this point, his son,

245
00:13:25.241 --> 00:13:28.480
Robert had joins the family business and helped his father with his building

246
00:13:28.481 --> 00:13:29.800
project like George.

247
00:13:30.040 --> 00:13:33.040
He showed a passion for engineering at a young age and would lend a hands

248
00:13:33.320 --> 00:13:34.153
whenever it was needed.

249
00:13:34.440 --> 00:13:37.270
Steve Vincent used cast iron for the railway instead of wood.

250
00:13:37.410 --> 00:13:39.830
It wasn't an ideal material as it was brittle,

251
00:13:39.831 --> 00:13:42.110
but George considered it the best choice available.

252
00:13:42.550 --> 00:13:46.630
He would later switch to rot iron because it was more malleable than therefore a

253
00:13:46.631 --> 00:13:48.990
better alternative, even though he lost money,

254
00:13:49.050 --> 00:13:53.230
as it meant not using his own patented design that in coy railway was opened in

255
00:13:53.390 --> 00:13:57.900
1822 and it was the first railway to be operated entirely without animal power.

256
00:13:57.901 --> 00:13:58.734
Afterwards,

257
00:13:58.780 --> 00:14:02.420
that building projects kept getting bigger and more ambitious for Stevenson who

258
00:14:02.421 --> 00:14:06.700
was next tasked with building a much longer 25 mile railway that connected coal

259
00:14:06.701 --> 00:14:10.220
mines between the cities of Stockton and Darlington and county Durham.

260
00:14:10.740 --> 00:14:15.100
Although to say he was tasked would be a bit disingenuous as Stevenson lobbied

261
00:14:15.101 --> 00:14:16.250
pretty hard for the project.

262
00:14:16.600 --> 00:14:19.570
Initially it was intended to use horse drawn wagons,

263
00:14:19.571 --> 00:14:23.450
but the engineer convinced the city and mining officials that a steam locomotive

264
00:14:23.451 --> 00:14:26.970
would be faster, more efficient and more practical. In the end,

265
00:14:27.070 --> 00:14:30.530
it would become a mixed railway that used both methods of locomotion

266
00:14:30.531 --> 00:14:34.410
construction on the Stockton and Darlington railway began in 1822 and it was

267
00:14:34.411 --> 00:14:37.000
opened on September the 27th of 1825.

268
00:14:37.340 --> 00:14:40.240
The railway was notable for multiple reasons, chief among them.

269
00:14:40.241 --> 00:14:44.000
The fact that it became the first public line to carry passengers by steam

270
00:14:44.001 --> 00:14:48.120
locomotive. And with that railway travel had officially arrived. It was delayed,

271
00:14:48.380 --> 00:14:51.560
it was over budget, but it was still a landmark moment.

272
00:14:51.950 --> 00:14:53.480
Stevenson was no fool.

273
00:14:53.660 --> 00:14:56.680
He realized that railway transportation was only gonna get bigger.

274
00:14:57.110 --> 00:15:01.160
More lines would be built perhaps even an entire network all over England.

275
00:15:01.270 --> 00:15:05.000
That meant that a lot of locomotives would be needed and someone had to build

276
00:15:05.001 --> 00:15:07.240
them. So why not him with that in mind,

277
00:15:07.300 --> 00:15:10.710
the Robert Stevenson and company locomotive manufacturing business was hundred

278
00:15:10.950 --> 00:15:12.470
in 1823. The first engine,

279
00:15:12.490 --> 00:15:16.670
the company built was also the first to travel on the Stockton and Darlington

280
00:15:16.671 --> 00:15:19.630
railway originally named active. By the time it was finished,

281
00:15:19.690 --> 00:15:22.070
it had been re christened locomotion. Number one,

282
00:15:22.210 --> 00:15:25.750
it was used in the maiden voyage of the railway reaching speeds of up to 15

283
00:15:25.751 --> 00:15:27.790
miles per hour, besides wagons full of coal.

284
00:15:27.930 --> 00:15:30.910
It also had a coach named experiment which had been especi.

285
00:15:31.220 --> 00:15:33.140
He designed to carry passengers. Of course,

286
00:15:33.141 --> 00:15:35.100
this coach could only see so many people,

287
00:15:35.240 --> 00:15:39.740
but many others were perfectly content riding in the cargo wagons just to be a

288
00:15:39.741 --> 00:15:41.340
part of this historic journey.

289
00:15:41.680 --> 00:15:45.460
It should be noted that the first trip that transported both people in cargo was

290
00:15:45.780 --> 00:15:48.500
intended as a one off afterwards locomotion number one,

291
00:15:48.720 --> 00:15:52.930
and the engines that followed it resumed standard D duties of transporting only

292
00:15:53.040 --> 00:15:56.010
coal. The experiment was still used for passenger travel,

293
00:15:56.110 --> 00:16:00.130
but it was pools by horses because it would've been too expensive to use a

294
00:16:00.131 --> 00:16:02.090
locomotive just for one coach.

295
00:16:02.470 --> 00:16:06.530
It would be a few more years until the first true steam powered railroad would

296
00:16:06.531 --> 00:16:07.410
be open for business.

297
00:16:14.040 --> 00:16:17.880
That railway would come in 1830 when George Stevenson finished his crowning

298
00:16:17.881 --> 00:16:18.500
achievements,

299
00:16:18.500 --> 00:16:22.440
the first ever inter city railway intended for both passenger and cargo

300
00:16:22.840 --> 00:16:25.280
transport powered entirely by steam locomotives.

301
00:16:25.300 --> 00:16:29.920
It went from Liverpool to Manchester stretching over 31 miles and no horse drawn

302
00:16:30.120 --> 00:16:32.000
carriages were allowed on it at any time.

303
00:16:32.220 --> 00:16:35.070
The line was responsible for a bunch of other world firsts,

304
00:16:35.071 --> 00:16:39.150
such as the first railway to use signaling the first function as a male delivery

305
00:16:39.151 --> 00:16:42.670
service and the first to have double tracks along its entire length,

306
00:16:42.671 --> 00:16:46.550
meaning that locomotives could travel in both directions unimpeded,

307
00:16:46.740 --> 00:16:51.550
despite all these accolades building the railway included one obstacle after

308
00:16:51.551 --> 00:16:54.980
another, especially for who served as chief engineer.

309
00:16:55.240 --> 00:16:57.380
It all started in 1824.

310
00:16:57.381 --> 00:17:00.740
When the Liverpool and Manchester railway company was actually founded.

311
00:17:00.960 --> 00:17:03.980
The men in charge, mostly consisted of merchants, politicians,

312
00:17:04.040 --> 00:17:07.660
and other officials from these two cities. These were two of the countries,

313
00:17:07.661 --> 00:17:10.780
biggest business hubs, particularly textiles at the time,

314
00:17:10.920 --> 00:17:14.050
but transporting communication between them was in efficient.

315
00:17:14.340 --> 00:17:15.250
There were two options,

316
00:17:15.550 --> 00:17:20.050
the canals which were slow and the roads which were dangerous and congested,

317
00:17:20.290 --> 00:17:22.450
a railway would've been superior to both of them.

318
00:17:22.580 --> 00:17:26.250
First off Stevenson needed to find a route that was suitable for his purposes.

319
00:17:26.430 --> 00:17:30.170
He soon discovered that many men objected to the idea of a railway passing

320
00:17:30.171 --> 00:17:31.170
through their lands.

321
00:17:31.240 --> 00:17:35.480
Some even going to the extreme length of hiring LUS to keep away surveyors

322
00:17:35.750 --> 00:17:37.600
Stevenson finally finished his survey,

323
00:17:38.000 --> 00:17:40.240
but it was rejected by parliament for being inaccurate.

324
00:17:40.420 --> 00:17:44.160
He made another one and it was rejected for the same reason as it turned out.

325
00:17:44.220 --> 00:17:48.120
He made a major miscalculation in his estimates in order to cross a boggy area

326
00:17:48.210 --> 00:17:49.440
named chat MOS,

327
00:17:49.500 --> 00:17:54.160
the railway would cost up to five times as much as he reported in 1826.

328
00:17:54.161 --> 00:17:58.920
George Stevenson was fired as engineer and was replaced by George and John Reny

329
00:17:59.070 --> 00:18:03.720
alongside Charles Viola who served as their project got approval

330
00:18:03.830 --> 00:18:08.400
from parliament in 1826. Fortunately for Stevenson, despite his mistakes,

331
00:18:08.630 --> 00:18:12.910
a committee behind the Liverpool and Manchester railway company insisted that he

332
00:18:12.911 --> 00:18:15.430
was hire back as the engineer for the actual construction.

333
00:18:16.030 --> 00:18:19.510
An interesting tidbit here is that this was the first time Stevenson used a

334
00:18:19.790 --> 00:18:24.270
gauge that measured four foot and eight inches or 1.4, three, five meters,

335
00:18:24.440 --> 00:18:27.070
which would then become known as the Stevenson gauge.

336
00:18:27.390 --> 00:18:31.940
And later the standard gauge as it became adopted worldwide in railways,

337
00:18:31.941 --> 00:18:35.420
the gauge is simply the width between the tracks measured between the inner

338
00:18:35.470 --> 00:18:36.500
signs of the rails.

339
00:18:36.570 --> 00:18:40.380
Back then there was no standard and engineers built tracks at whatever distance

340
00:18:40.410 --> 00:18:42.700
they felt was best Brinell. For example,

341
00:18:42.730 --> 00:18:45.860
another one of England's greatest engineers favored the seven foot gauge.

342
00:18:45.990 --> 00:18:50.090
Eventually parliament stepped in and passed the gauge act in 80 46,

343
00:18:50.091 --> 00:18:53.210
making the Stevens engage the standard throughout great Britain.

344
00:18:53.390 --> 00:18:57.530
So that locomotives and wagons could be used on more than just the original

345
00:18:57.531 --> 00:18:59.970
railway they were built for from an engineering perspective,

346
00:19:00.150 --> 00:19:03.970
the inner city railway was a massive undertaking Stevenson had to design the

347
00:19:04.290 --> 00:19:07.490
Wapping tunnel. The first of its kind to be bored under a big city,

348
00:19:07.660 --> 00:19:11.520
64 bridges and fire a had to be built for the this 30 mile stretch of railway.

349
00:19:11.580 --> 00:19:13.440
And yet, despite all this effort,

350
00:19:13.740 --> 00:19:17.800
it almost came to be that the line would function without locomotives.

351
00:19:17.950 --> 00:19:21.560
What the committee wanted was a fast way to move cargo and people between

352
00:19:21.561 --> 00:19:24.680
Liverpool and Manchester. And for that, they got the railway.

353
00:19:24.710 --> 00:19:26.880
What they weren't sold on was the locomotives.

354
00:19:26.910 --> 00:19:30.280
They thought that it would be better to use stationary steam engines placed

355
00:19:30.570 --> 00:19:33.710
points along the route, which would pull the wagons using cables,

356
00:19:33.730 --> 00:19:38.270
unsurprisingly Stevenson disagreed and convinced them to stage a competition to

357
00:19:38.271 --> 00:19:42.110
see which method was best taking place. In October, 1829.

358
00:19:42.111 --> 00:19:45.350
It became known as the rain hill trials truth be told.

359
00:19:45.500 --> 00:19:48.390
They probably could have sorted this out quietly one afternoon,

360
00:19:48.490 --> 00:19:50.830
but with the opening of the line fast approach,

361
00:19:51.090 --> 00:19:53.620
they thought that a little publicity wouldn't hurt.

362
00:19:53.840 --> 00:19:56.180
So they turned the whole thing into a massive event.

363
00:19:56.270 --> 00:20:00.740
There was even a 500 pound prize and anyone was allowed to enter as long as

364
00:20:00.741 --> 00:20:04.220
their machine met, certain criteria, 10 engines entered the competition,

365
00:20:04.240 --> 00:20:06.100
but only five were already on the day.

366
00:20:06.250 --> 00:20:10.060
They included cycle pairs at locomotive that was still drawn by horses.

367
00:20:10.520 --> 00:20:12.610
The Stevensons design lined a new locomotive,

368
00:20:12.611 --> 00:20:15.130
especially for this competition and named it rocket.

369
00:20:15.430 --> 00:20:18.210
It would've been pretty embarrassing if they ended up not having the best

370
00:20:18.211 --> 00:20:19.770
machine for the railway they built,

371
00:20:20.030 --> 00:20:22.610
but the father and son team had no cost to worry.

372
00:20:22.611 --> 00:20:24.370
Rocket was not only the fastest engine,

373
00:20:24.590 --> 00:20:26.970
but also the only one that managed to complete the trials.

374
00:20:27.230 --> 00:20:31.130
It was decided that Stevenson locomotives would be used for the railway.

375
00:20:31.390 --> 00:20:35.560
The grands open took place on the 15th of September, 1830, the prime minister,

376
00:20:35.561 --> 00:20:39.320
the duke of Wellington had his own special carriage as did many other esteemed

377
00:20:39.321 --> 00:20:41.840
guests, such as politicians and foreign ambassadors.

378
00:20:41.940 --> 00:20:45.160
The festivities were only slightly marred by the fact that the member of

379
00:20:45.161 --> 00:20:46.120
parliament for Liverpool,

380
00:20:46.121 --> 00:20:50.720
William Huskison was accidentally run over and killed by one of the trains.

381
00:20:50.910 --> 00:20:55.280
Thus having the I distinction of becoming the first reported railway casualty

382
00:21:01.350 --> 00:21:05.280
From then on the Stevenson company always had more work offers than it could

383
00:21:05.281 --> 00:21:08.350
handle as the British rail way network kept growing for some of them.

384
00:21:08.351 --> 00:21:12.110
They only built locomotives for others. They constructed the entire railroad.

385
00:21:12.670 --> 00:21:15.950
Well for some, they only did the survey. And of course on many railways,

386
00:21:15.951 --> 00:21:19.150
they did all three, even. So starting in the mid 1830s,

387
00:21:19.151 --> 00:21:22.670
Robert Stevenson began taking on the role of chief engineer while his father

388
00:21:22.820 --> 00:21:25.550
took a more passive role after decades of hard labor,

389
00:21:25.551 --> 00:21:26.750
ever since he was a small child,

390
00:21:27.040 --> 00:21:31.300
George Stevenson was content with stepping back a bit and letting his son build

391
00:21:31.460 --> 00:21:35.580
on his accomplishments and his reputation in later life Stevenson often served

392
00:21:35.581 --> 00:21:37.820
as a consultant, not only for his own company,

393
00:21:37.960 --> 00:21:40.100
but also for foreign railroad developers,

394
00:21:40.101 --> 00:21:43.860
particularly the Americans he gave to a on railways and took on various

395
00:21:44.220 --> 00:21:44.501
positions,

396
00:21:44.501 --> 00:21:48.090
such as being the first president of the institution of mechanical engineers in

397
00:21:48.091 --> 00:21:51.050
London, in his personal life Stevenson married two more times,

398
00:21:51.150 --> 00:21:54.930
but had no more children. He bought various as estates using the large wealth.

399
00:21:54.950 --> 00:21:58.490
He had accumulated the last of which being tapped in house and Darba share

400
00:21:59.090 --> 00:22:01.090
there. He became a very keen garden ORs ever.

401
00:22:01.091 --> 00:22:05.490
The engineer gave the world one last invention. The cucumber straighten up long,

402
00:22:05.770 --> 00:22:07.570
straight cucumbers are still popular today.

403
00:22:08.040 --> 00:22:11.920
It was during the Victorian era that this craze first appeared Stevenson's

404
00:22:11.921 --> 00:22:15.560
invention was simply an elongated glass funnel that would be placed over the

405
00:22:15.561 --> 00:22:18.920
vegetable in its early stage to encourage it to grow straight.

406
00:22:19.150 --> 00:22:21.040
Just several months into his third marriage.

407
00:22:21.060 --> 00:22:24.880
George Stevenson died on August the 12th, 1848 in his home.

408
00:22:24.930 --> 00:22:28.400
After about a Pursy. He was 67 years old. And to the legacy,

409
00:22:28.570 --> 00:22:30.550
see he left behind was evident immediately,

410
00:22:30.570 --> 00:22:32.910
but only increased as the decades rolled on.

411
00:22:33.310 --> 00:22:37.550
And the true significance of the role of the railway network in a new modern

412
00:22:37.640 --> 00:22:41.950
world became undeniable. So I really hope you found that video. Interesting.
