3
00:00:13.610 --> 00:00:16.940
It's a real work of art that comes to represent the entire movement,

4
00:00:16.941 --> 00:00:20.870
the birthdays Monet's waterlilies and impressionism, for example,

5
00:00:21.010 --> 00:00:24.350
or malaise Ophelia, and the Pre-Raphaelites in today's case,

6
00:00:24.380 --> 00:00:28.670
nothing represents surrealism quite like the image of a melting clock.

7
00:00:28.910 --> 00:00:33.530
No artists better encapsulates the field of surrealism more than

8
00:00:33.531 --> 00:00:36.260
Salvador Dali. If you know nothing about art,

9
00:00:36.290 --> 00:00:41.180
if you grow up insides that compounds from the village and have never seen

10
00:00:41.181 --> 00:00:43.370
pencil put to paper, you know,

11
00:00:43.371 --> 00:00:47.180
that melting clocks probably means things are about to get weird.

12
00:00:47.240 --> 00:00:51.380
One of the most referenced images in the modern Canon inspiring jokes and

13
00:00:51.381 --> 00:00:53.720
everything from the Simpsons to Looney tunes,

14
00:00:53.750 --> 00:00:57.110
the persistence of memory is the brain child of none,

15
00:00:57.111 --> 00:00:59.240
other than all-boys Salvador,

16
00:00:59.270 --> 00:01:04.010
the genre defining multimedia artists best known for living a

17
00:01:04.011 --> 00:01:07.760
life. That was almost as weird as the subject he painted,

18
00:01:07.970 --> 00:01:09.020
depending on the source.

19
00:01:09.021 --> 00:01:12.950
The mousing clock represents either the impermanence of time or the melting of

20
00:01:12.951 --> 00:01:15.230
cheese. It's a deeply ironic image,

21
00:01:15.260 --> 00:01:18.830
but the greater irony lies in the fact that during his life,

22
00:01:19.010 --> 00:01:21.680
the man who would come to represent surrealism,

23
00:01:21.830 --> 00:01:25.850
found himself kicked out of the movement by the very friends and colleagues who

24
00:01:26.030 --> 00:01:27.290
Rose to fame with him

25
00:01:33.620 --> 00:01:37.580
Born in 1904 to a middle-class family. Dolly began painting early,

26
00:01:37.581 --> 00:01:41.960
showing a formidable commands of impressionism and had his first public gallery

27
00:01:41.961 --> 00:01:44.720
show. At the age of 14, he was by all accounts,

28
00:01:44.721 --> 00:01:48.440
a shy and introverted child who spent much of his time playing around the Rocky

29
00:01:48.441 --> 00:01:50.210
coast of catechesis and Spain.

30
00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:54.560
It was a favorite vacation spot for his family and as the eventual site of his

31
00:01:54.561 --> 00:01:58.040
first and best loved house, while he and his sister were close,

32
00:01:58.070 --> 00:02:01.940
both of them often felt overshadowed by the ghost of their parents' first child

33
00:02:02.120 --> 00:02:05.300
who died at the age of two shortly before Darlie's birth.

34
00:02:05.390 --> 00:02:10.010
He would later paint a portrait of his brother and often described him as the

35
00:02:10.011 --> 00:02:11.690
first version of myself,

36
00:02:11.870 --> 00:02:15.920
but conceived too much in the absolute it's impossible to overstate.

37
00:02:15.950 --> 00:02:19.190
The impact of casts had on Dolly's development as an artist,

38
00:02:19.460 --> 00:02:22.910
the alien Rocky shores, visible on so many of his canvases,

39
00:02:23.060 --> 00:02:26.150
the washed out beaches populated by lone bathers,

40
00:02:26.420 --> 00:02:30.860
all of these trace back to the days that he spent wandering around the tide

41
00:02:31.310 --> 00:02:35.600
bulls gazing in ore and horror Ash, the full mystery of undersea life,

42
00:02:35.750 --> 00:02:38.600
a morphous jellyfish, and radial [inaudible],

43
00:02:38.610 --> 00:02:40.490
which he and his father loved to eat.

44
00:02:40.880 --> 00:02:44.960
His early work is often painted against barren landscapes marked by odd rock

45
00:02:44.961 --> 00:02:46.340
formations in the distance,

46
00:02:46.341 --> 00:02:50.990
a callback to his much loved coast where the oddly pitted and almost

47
00:02:50.991 --> 00:02:55.460
alien landscape suggests an impossible array of creatures trapped in stone,

48
00:02:55.461 --> 00:02:59.560
waiting to leap upwards and drag you into the council of light nightmare that

49
00:02:59.561 --> 00:03:03.100
they escaped from the figure of the sleeping head referred to as the great

50
00:03:03.101 --> 00:03:07.840
masturbator is rumored to have been inspired by one specific fallen Boulder

51
00:03:07.960 --> 00:03:12.070
arched, like a kidney bean and pitted with a sponge-like array of holes.

52
00:03:12.100 --> 00:03:15.730
One can easily envision a young Dolly staring at this rock, imagining it,

53
00:03:15.731 --> 00:03:19.540
some fantastical monster cowering over in the fetal position.

54
00:03:19.840 --> 00:03:24.070
Maybe he imagined it as himself hiding from his father's wrath.

55
00:03:24.220 --> 00:03:26.470
Even during his youth, that relationship was Rocky.

56
00:03:26.650 --> 00:03:30.790
His father's stringent discipline was softened by his mother's dutiful cuddling.

57
00:03:31.090 --> 00:03:33.160
So she died when he was only 16.

58
00:03:33.220 --> 00:03:37.600
He described it as the greatest blow I had experienced in my life.

59
00:03:37.720 --> 00:03:40.300
His father married his mother, sister Patty a year later,

60
00:03:40.301 --> 00:03:44.260
but this relationship did not seem to troubled Ali as disagreeable as they

61
00:03:44.261 --> 00:03:45.250
might've been. Dolly's.

62
00:03:45.251 --> 00:03:49.150
Father was an ardent supporter of his son's autistic developments paying for

63
00:03:49.300 --> 00:03:52.060
books of impressionist paintings and personal tutors.

64
00:03:52.210 --> 00:03:56.080
He even went so far as to arrange a gallery showing for his 17 year old son.

65
00:03:56.230 --> 00:03:59.080
The location was the municipal fitter Infor Guerrez,

66
00:03:59.081 --> 00:04:01.510
which would later become the Darley theater museum.

67
00:04:01.720 --> 00:04:05.440
The very building he would eventually die in if Dolly ever remarked upon the

68
00:04:05.441 --> 00:04:08.260
irony of dying in the place, which birthed him as an artist,

69
00:04:08.560 --> 00:04:12.160
it was never recorded as it would eventually be. Donnie's controversial art,

70
00:04:12.161 --> 00:04:13.270
which drove them apart.

71
00:04:13.420 --> 00:04:17.350
One must wonder if his father ever regretted supporting his creative endeavors

72
00:04:17.351 --> 00:04:18.220
in the first place.

73
00:04:18.250 --> 00:04:22.780
So much drama and strife was birthed from a single act of support.

74
00:04:22.900 --> 00:04:25.180
Let this be a lesson to fathers listening today,

75
00:04:25.420 --> 00:04:29.010
never support your children unless they become the next Salvador

76
00:04:35.910 --> 00:04:40.020
College Salvador. Dani studied at the San Fernando Royal Academy of fine arts.

77
00:04:40.410 --> 00:04:44.820
He made friends with artists like Lewis, Brunel, and Frederico Garcia, Lorca.

78
00:04:44.910 --> 00:04:47.970
The latter of whom held a deepen unrequited passion for Dolly.

79
00:04:48.090 --> 00:04:52.020
Now it's easy to start from the popular image of adult Dolly as an exuberance

80
00:04:52.050 --> 00:04:53.580
anteater earning weirdo,

81
00:04:53.581 --> 00:04:57.240
and simply make it smaller to represent his youth.

82
00:04:57.270 --> 00:05:00.120
But he was actually quite shy in school among his friends.

83
00:05:00.121 --> 00:05:02.520
He was considered to be bad with girls, that traits,

84
00:05:02.521 --> 00:05:05.400
which would very much resolve itself with sufficient time.

85
00:05:05.640 --> 00:05:09.390
He and his friends studied the art movements emerging in Barcelona and Paris,

86
00:05:09.391 --> 00:05:13.020
as well as the new and controversial theories of academics like Freud.

87
00:05:13.470 --> 00:05:17.130
Dolly would go on to paint some of the first Cubist wax ever produced in Madrid,

88
00:05:17.280 --> 00:05:20.130
starting with the geometric cabaret scene though,

89
00:05:20.131 --> 00:05:22.920
it often takes over a thousand words to describe a picture up.

90
00:05:22.980 --> 00:05:26.670
It's easy to say this one is like if Keith Herring did the cover art for a

91
00:05:26.671 --> 00:05:30.480
smooth jazz album that was sold exclusively at Starbucks after accusing his

92
00:05:30.481 --> 00:05:32.370
professors of being unqualified to judge.

93
00:05:32.371 --> 00:05:35.850
And he dropped out shortly before his final exams in 1926,

94
00:05:36.060 --> 00:05:40.500
normally that kind of stunt lands you in a factory sewing belts and buckles onto

95
00:05:40.860 --> 00:05:43.890
hat spot. When you're already friends with Pablo Picasso,

96
00:05:44.100 --> 00:05:48.870
all that was left for Dolly to do was growing a mustache and start blowing

97
00:05:48.871 --> 00:05:49.950
people's minds.

98
00:05:56.340 --> 00:05:58.130
<v 1>By the time he to graduate, Dolly.</v>

99
00:05:58.130 --> 00:06:02.120
<v 0>Had already cultivated an image of an eccentric dandy dressing in stockings and</v>

100
00:06:02.600 --> 00:06:03.433
knee breeches.

101
00:06:03.560 --> 00:06:06.860
Like he was a lesson aristocrat waiting in line at the guillotine.

102
00:06:06.950 --> 00:06:10.700
It's somewhat refreshing to know that at school kids remain unchanged across

103
00:06:10.730 --> 00:06:13.730
history and geography with the notable exception.

104
00:06:13.940 --> 00:06:16.820
That's the weirdly dressed old school dropouts, you know,

105
00:06:17.120 --> 00:06:21.020
never go on to become Salvador, Dali his secrets. And in fact,

106
00:06:21.050 --> 00:06:25.330
the unspoken rule across all artistic pursuits is that you can get away with

107
00:06:25.331 --> 00:06:29.620
being a weird pretentious dog, as long as your work is very,

108
00:06:29.621 --> 00:06:34.060
very good in all accounts beyond Ali's work is that good has

109
00:06:34.090 --> 00:06:38.890
absolute mastery of representational realism can be seen in basket of bread,

110
00:06:38.891 --> 00:06:40.030
1926,

111
00:06:40.031 --> 00:06:44.830
where he managed to lend an air of stock drama to a painting of a few slices

112
00:06:45.010 --> 00:06:47.890
of buttered bread. Not painting is over 90 years old,

113
00:06:47.891 --> 00:06:51.160
and it's still fresher than anything service they've gone.

114
00:06:51.160 --> 00:06:55.600
And one almost gets the sense that he is mocking his teachers and peers showing

115
00:06:55.601 --> 00:06:59.050
off by putting so much effort and to such a simple scene.

116
00:06:59.110 --> 00:07:02.530
It sounds ridiculous to say there's an oil painting of bread fields.

117
00:07:02.560 --> 00:07:06.490
Sarcastic if you look at it too long, but just try it,

118
00:07:06.670 --> 00:07:11.110
look at it too long. And tell me if it doesn't eventually feel insulting,

119
00:07:11.140 --> 00:07:13.870
just how accurately the bread is painted.

120
00:07:14.050 --> 00:07:17.020
A common critique of modern art is that it's deliberately weird and

121
00:07:17.050 --> 00:07:20.800
incomprehensible in order to cover a lack of foundational skills.

122
00:07:20.801 --> 00:07:25.190
And to be sure there and often is for every actually talented

123
00:07:25.870 --> 00:07:30.460
eccentric there's 20 Pierre Romans zone is pooping into a can and

124
00:07:30.490 --> 00:07:34.870
daring you to buy it. Dolly was not this. He was a popular,

125
00:07:34.900 --> 00:07:39.310
charismatic young fellow who knew the breadth of his skills and pushed himself

126
00:07:39.340 --> 00:07:41.380
beyond what his conscious mind. Good enough.

127
00:07:48.670 --> 00:07:52.270
He studied Freud heavily seeking to unleash the full weight of his creative

128
00:07:52.271 --> 00:07:55.570
forces from the shackles of formal logic. At that time,

129
00:07:55.571 --> 00:07:59.650
the surrealist movement was lost in a directionless Mar preoccupied with

130
00:07:59.651 --> 00:08:02.320
automatic processes of creation. And to this mix,

131
00:08:02.710 --> 00:08:07.060
Dolly added his paranoiac critical method by focusing on abstract threats to the

132
00:08:07.061 --> 00:08:09.400
person in order to induce a paranoid state,

133
00:08:09.940 --> 00:08:13.990
Darlie was able to draw up fantastical images from the deepest recesses of his

134
00:08:13.991 --> 00:08:14.620
mind,

135
00:08:14.620 --> 00:08:19.000
delivering hands painted dream photographs by filtering the real world through

136
00:08:19.001 --> 00:08:23.590
that lens of absolute paranoia in much the same way that humans see faces in

137
00:08:23.591 --> 00:08:27.850
toast or woodgrain Dolly could envision armies of ants, giant eggs,

138
00:08:27.851 --> 00:08:32.710
elephants with impossibly stretched limbs and bulbous protrusions of flesh

139
00:08:32.740 --> 00:08:34.180
held up by crutches.

140
00:08:34.330 --> 00:08:38.230
This period is marked by the frequently recycled image of a child and his

141
00:08:38.231 --> 00:08:39.850
parents on the coastline.

142
00:08:39.851 --> 00:08:43.930
One inspired by a childhood photo of Dolly himself where human figures on to

143
00:08:44.140 --> 00:08:47.590
picked it. They are small and face away from the viewer geometric shapes,

144
00:08:47.591 --> 00:08:52.090
stack Paul to top each other in defiance of balance and gravity early works like

145
00:08:52.091 --> 00:08:56.460
the first days of spring and apparatus and hand show the clear influence of his

146
00:08:56.461 --> 00:08:58.890
contemporary and friend Eve tangy.

147
00:08:58.920 --> 00:09:03.810
Who's also heavily features indecipherable objects and vague Rocky coasts

148
00:09:04.020 --> 00:09:06.000
Eve was also known for eating live spiders.

149
00:09:06.001 --> 00:09:09.420
A party's burning a reputation as an artist has never been easy.

150
00:09:09.480 --> 00:09:12.750
According to the niece of Eve Tanguy Dolly once said to her,

151
00:09:12.990 --> 00:09:16.260
I pinched everything from your uncle Eve of course,

152
00:09:16.290 --> 00:09:20.730
being part of an artistic movement means influencing and being influenced by

153
00:09:20.731 --> 00:09:23.790
others in turn, if it wasn't a failure of early studies of cubism,

154
00:09:24.450 --> 00:09:26.970
Dolly wouldn't have been inspired to experiment with form.

155
00:09:27.000 --> 00:09:30.030
Is he a plagiarist for borrowing the techniques of his friend?

156
00:09:30.031 --> 00:09:32.310
Picasso would Dolly have been Dolly?

157
00:09:32.340 --> 00:09:36.240
Had he not drawn from the influences that he did during the screening of a film?

158
00:09:36.600 --> 00:09:37.950
Donnie wrote age of gold,

159
00:09:37.980 --> 00:09:41.880
the right-wing radical group league of Patriots disrupted the screening a time

160
00:09:41.900 --> 00:09:46.500
to the audience and smashed artworks by even other collaborators decrying the

161
00:09:46.501 --> 00:09:50.640
film and surrealism in general is a poison designed to corrupt the people.

162
00:09:50.670 --> 00:09:55.350
The surrealists responded to this criticism as all great artists do by

163
00:09:55.351 --> 00:09:59.100
getting much weird up dollies fascination with Freud took the forefronts.

164
00:09:59.310 --> 00:10:00.450
As his reputation grew,

165
00:10:00.451 --> 00:10:04.260
he found himself liberated to commit his elicit desires to canvas drawing,

166
00:10:04.410 --> 00:10:09.090
nude forms, tortured beyond recognition. Sex became a curious kind of obsession.

167
00:10:09.091 --> 00:10:11.250
Something you could have gained very easily,

168
00:10:11.251 --> 00:10:15.720
which was denied through a complex web of invisible hangups.

169
00:10:15.780 --> 00:10:19.860
Maybe he hoped that if he delved deep enough into his own subconscious,

170
00:10:19.870 --> 00:10:24.150
you could find the source of these hangups and allow himself to pursue these

171
00:10:24.151 --> 00:10:29.010
desires rather than exercise them upon the canvas. Thankfully for us,

172
00:10:29.190 --> 00:10:30.023
he didn't.

173
00:10:30.090 --> 00:10:33.600
Now you might not have to worry about all of your hard work getting smashed up

174
00:10:33.630 --> 00:10:34.890
by right-wing radicals,

175
00:10:34.920 --> 00:10:39.110
but you do have to worry about backing up your files and the best way to back up

176
00:10:39.111 --> 00:10:41.690
those files is with Backblaze. Now, as you guys know,

177
00:10:41.720 --> 00:10:43.850
I like to try the sponsors that we have on this show.

178
00:10:43.851 --> 00:10:48.770
And indeed I'm using today's sponsor right now, both as I record this video.

179
00:10:48.830 --> 00:10:51.950
And as you probably watch it, my files right now,

180
00:10:52.130 --> 00:10:54.950
I being synced with bank blazer servers. I'm looking over there.

181
00:10:55.600 --> 00:10:57.590
That's where my computer is. You just,

182
00:10:57.591 --> 00:11:01.160
just churning away over there in the background's uploading the videos that I

183
00:11:01.170 --> 00:11:05.180
made this morning to their service. So I have emergency copies of them.

184
00:11:06.070 --> 00:11:07.280
Think about backing stuff up anymore.

185
00:11:07.281 --> 00:11:11.870
I just rest assured the Backblaze is running. It's taken care of it all.

186
00:11:11.990 --> 00:11:13.820
Sometimes I go into the app just to see how it's going.

187
00:11:13.820 --> 00:11:17.660
I was greeted by that warm. You are backed up message. It's pretty beautiful.

188
00:11:17.900 --> 00:11:21.260
I've not yet had to call on them because of a hard disk failure or such a thing

189
00:11:21.261 --> 00:11:24.260
like that. But I know that if that does happen,

190
00:11:24.530 --> 00:11:27.110
I'm all good because I'll just send them a message being like, guys,

191
00:11:27.111 --> 00:11:30.590
I lost a hard desk and well, I can either download all the files,

192
00:11:30.620 --> 00:11:34.160
but that might take a while. It's a lot of files or I can just say, Hey guys,

193
00:11:34.161 --> 00:11:37.160
would you ship me out a disc with all my files on it? And they'll be like, sure,

194
00:11:37.190 --> 00:11:39.800
we'll do that. And it will be encrypted by the way. Of course,

195
00:11:39.801 --> 00:11:43.310
when you upload everything is encrypted as well, super safe.

196
00:11:43.400 --> 00:11:46.910
It's a totally hands off experience, fully recommended.

197
00:11:47.120 --> 00:11:50.600
And you guys get a 15 day free trial right now.

198
00:11:51.170 --> 00:11:52.310
Backblaze is unlimited.

199
00:11:52.311 --> 00:11:56.830
There are no additional charges or fees and it's amazing peace of mind. In fact,

200
00:11:56.831 --> 00:11:59.830
it's the easiest way I know of to get that peace of mind,

201
00:11:59.831 --> 00:12:01.900
which is why I use it so that don't put it off,

202
00:12:02.200 --> 00:12:04.740
see how easy it is with a 15 day free trial,

203
00:12:04.770 --> 00:12:08.980
just go to backblaze.com forward slash biographics and going through that link,

204
00:12:09.070 --> 00:12:12.280
lets them know that we sent you and it helps support the show.

205
00:12:12.580 --> 00:12:14.110
So thank you very much. And let's get back

206
00:12:21.000 --> 00:12:24.300
Indulge me for a moment in a bit of postmodern analysis for,

207
00:12:24.301 --> 00:12:28.740
it seems irresponsible to talk about an artist without talking about his art.

208
00:12:29.160 --> 00:12:32.370
As you're probably aware, it depicts a number of soft melting watches,

209
00:12:32.640 --> 00:12:34.020
draped over a variety of shapes,

210
00:12:34.021 --> 00:12:37.890
such as a tree sleeping figure as an odd rectangular protrusion.

211
00:12:37.920 --> 00:12:42.090
The background is just a distant coastline complete with shadowy catechist

212
00:12:42.660 --> 00:12:42.870
cliffs.

213
00:12:42.870 --> 00:12:46.860
It's easy to read the soft watches as a commentary on the malleable nature of

214
00:12:46.861 --> 00:12:50.430
time. Given Darlie's public appreciation of Einstein's theories,

215
00:12:50.610 --> 00:12:54.870
lacking rigidity and internal structure devoured by a thousand tiny ants.

216
00:12:54.900 --> 00:12:59.640
The ultimate symbol of structure and order finds itself besieged by the

217
00:12:59.641 --> 00:13:01.200
forces of decay. Of course,

218
00:13:01.680 --> 00:13:04.950
Dolly denied all that saying instead the image was a surrealist interpretation

219
00:13:04.951 --> 00:13:09.420
of a runny Canavan cheese that he saw at a picnic. The man loved food,

220
00:13:09.421 --> 00:13:12.300
even actually write a cookbook, which has recently been reissued.

221
00:13:12.390 --> 00:13:15.300
In addition to being both large and expensive,

222
00:13:15.510 --> 00:13:19.290
many of the recipes are deliberately difficult to prepare and assemble either

223
00:13:19.291 --> 00:13:23.340
way. The melting clock is a motif that he would revisit decades later during his

224
00:13:23.341 --> 00:13:27.630
nuclear mysticism phase in the disintegration of the persistence of memory where

225
00:13:27.631 --> 00:13:31.590
the previous city solid shapes have been replaced with a matrix of smaller cubes

226
00:13:31.620 --> 00:13:33.810
referencing the empty space between atoms,

227
00:13:33.900 --> 00:13:36.870
even the ocean in the background finds itself,

228
00:13:36.900 --> 00:13:39.510
appealed upwards like a pancake mid flip.

229
00:13:39.630 --> 00:13:43.890
The realization that everything solid is made up of empty space clearly held a

230
00:13:43.891 --> 00:13:46.140
place of prominence. In Darlie's mind.

231
00:13:46.380 --> 00:13:51.060
The tree is in disintegration marks by prominent gaps in their own continuity.

232
00:13:51.150 --> 00:13:55.350
Everything go here and has been replaced by a grids of tiny versions of

233
00:13:55.351 --> 00:13:58.410
themselves. Perfect approximation of atomic.

234
00:13:58.411 --> 00:14:03.060
Representationalism what subconscious desire was to Don his old work atoms were

235
00:14:03.180 --> 00:14:07.080
to the nuclear mysticism phase one prominent example, gala dare.

236
00:14:07.170 --> 00:14:09.860
If the spheres features a deep field of all this,

237
00:14:09.870 --> 00:14:13.620
which resemble when taken as a whole, a bust of his muse gala,

238
00:14:13.800 --> 00:14:18.330
this veers themselves seem to well and dance around the canvas recalling how

239
00:14:18.720 --> 00:14:23.220
hair moves in winds or electrons spin around a nucleus. If you asked him,

240
00:14:23.520 --> 00:14:26.820
Dolly would have denied the existence of any messages in his work,

241
00:14:26.910 --> 00:14:30.150
in the Dick cavette interview, where he unleashed an anteater on the host,

242
00:14:30.330 --> 00:14:31.200
he answered this,

243
00:14:31.350 --> 00:14:36.300
the melting clock had no meaning that has paintings were just hypnogogic images

244
00:14:36.301 --> 00:14:40.230
drawn from the subconscious five minutes before waking that conflicts with the

245
00:14:40.231 --> 00:14:41.100
theories of Freud,

246
00:14:41.101 --> 00:14:45.270
which would posit a great deal of meaning and the sometimes graphically sexual

247
00:14:45.271 --> 00:14:49.770
imagery that Dali used in his work like the condom shot loaf and cattle and

248
00:14:49.771 --> 00:14:53.090
bread complete with lovingly draped melting clock.

249
00:14:53.180 --> 00:14:55.430
Obviously it's a phallic representation,

250
00:14:55.431 --> 00:14:59.600
but the point of surrealism is that what's an object represents is not fixed or

251
00:14:59.930 --> 00:15:01.670
rotting. Donkey can mean sexual excitement.

252
00:15:01.671 --> 00:15:04.040
If you happen to be a swarm of flies.

253
00:15:04.100 --> 00:15:07.760
When Dali once famously asked at a restaurant, when I order the lobster,

254
00:15:07.910 --> 00:15:11.480
why do you not bring me a telephone? He wasn't just being precious.

255
00:15:11.660 --> 00:15:15.710
He was asking us to evaluate our assumptions about the meaning of images.

256
00:15:15.950 --> 00:15:20.000
What authority gets to define the significance of a melting clock or a Randi

257
00:15:20.001 --> 00:15:20.834
loaf of bread.

258
00:15:20.840 --> 00:15:25.430
The point of surrealism is to bring forth a solid dream into the waking world.

259
00:15:25.431 --> 00:15:28.550
And it's what authority assigns meanings to dreams.

260
00:15:29.060 --> 00:15:31.640
Dolly explained to him that the crunch symbolizes impotence,

261
00:15:31.641 --> 00:15:34.640
that it supports softness, which cannot stand on its own.

262
00:15:34.820 --> 00:15:36.080
But to someone with one leg,

263
00:15:36.081 --> 00:15:39.800
a crutch might represent the difference between helplessness and agency is that

264
00:15:39.801 --> 00:15:43.550
interpretation less valid because it disagrees with the artist

265
00:15:49.660 --> 00:15:52.180
It's in 1929, that Donnelly's upward trajectory.

266
00:15:52.240 --> 00:15:56.230
It becomes undeniable namely through meeting his future wife manager and

267
00:15:56.231 --> 00:16:01.230
co-conspirator gala Don Canova already married to Paul ILADS poets

268
00:16:01.231 --> 00:16:03.160
and co-founder of the surrealist movement,

269
00:16:03.161 --> 00:16:06.580
which gave Donny his signature flat gala was everything.

270
00:16:06.820 --> 00:16:10.330
Donnie was not confidence in her body and sexually accomplished a passionate

271
00:16:10.331 --> 00:16:14.070
affair sooner raised between the two wins gala's marriage to pull and did

272
00:16:14.080 --> 00:16:15.010
shortly thereafter.

273
00:16:15.070 --> 00:16:18.820
The nature of their physical relationship remains an issue of discussion for

274
00:16:18.880 --> 00:16:19.480
perverts.

275
00:16:19.480 --> 00:16:22.690
Dolly was known to say that gala was the only woman he made proper love to

276
00:16:22.691 --> 00:16:24.070
throughout his entire life.

277
00:16:24.310 --> 00:16:28.390
Maybe a lifelong predilection with Catholicism prevented and exploration of his

278
00:16:28.391 --> 00:16:29.980
natural instincts. Either way,

279
00:16:30.220 --> 00:16:33.100
neither of them were contends where even in the sex life,

280
00:16:33.160 --> 00:16:37.210
they were both unfaithful to each other and an oddly inclusive sort of way.

281
00:16:37.300 --> 00:16:40.390
He would watch out with other lovers pleasuring himself. Other times,

282
00:16:40.720 --> 00:16:44.800
Donnie would indulge dalliances with his models and hangers-on by pleasuring

283
00:16:44.801 --> 00:16:47.830
himself, the cycle of admires, they cultivated prized,

284
00:16:47.831 --> 00:16:52.240
ambiguity and androgyny seeking a beauty Unchained by social

285
00:16:52.241 --> 00:16:55.750
expectations of physiology. When it came to choosing Dawn's partners,

286
00:16:56.440 --> 00:16:57.273
gala had her pickup.

287
00:17:03.820 --> 00:17:03.970
<v 1>[Inaudible].</v>

288
00:17:03.970 --> 00:17:08.770
<v 0>During the autistic process, Dolly would frequently over his subject habits,</v>

289
00:17:08.771 --> 00:17:10.840
which would later prove problematic.

290
00:17:11.230 --> 00:17:13.360
Garlic maintains the occasional tryst though.

291
00:17:13.420 --> 00:17:15.640
Both were discreet in their indiscretions.

292
00:17:16.090 --> 00:17:19.660
Donny joined at least one of his proteges in a spiritual marriage on the

293
00:17:19.661 --> 00:17:22.990
mountains. Alban's Garland managed an affair in the mid seventies,

294
00:17:22.991 --> 00:17:26.230
do the singer who played Jesus in Jesus Christ, superstar,

295
00:17:26.830 --> 00:17:30.130
Dolly bombastic in his Catholicism could only have been thrilled.

296
00:17:30.580 --> 00:17:33.460
Dolly treated controversy is just another color on his palette.

297
00:17:33.550 --> 00:17:36.910
During one of his first public speeches, as part of the surrealist group,

298
00:17:36.940 --> 00:17:41.290
he insulted the audience and Catalonia as a whole, during a later presentation,

299
00:17:41.291 --> 00:17:44.380
he arrived wearing a full diving suit and almost suffocated.

300
00:17:44.770 --> 00:17:48.340
It was only freed when a companion found a wrench outside and detached the

301
00:17:48.341 --> 00:17:49.770
helmets in his defense,

302
00:17:50.070 --> 00:17:52.770
Dani claims that he wanted to show you that he was fully submerged in the

303
00:17:52.771 --> 00:17:56.310
subconscious control. C was no stranger to his home life. Either.

304
00:17:56.550 --> 00:17:59.850
His parents were skeptical of his relationship with gala who was 10 years older

305
00:17:59.851 --> 00:18:03.540
and abandoned a husband and child to be with him while his connection to his

306
00:18:03.541 --> 00:18:05.670
father had never been particularly stable.

307
00:18:06.060 --> 00:18:09.660
Danny found himself excised from the family after producing a painting,

308
00:18:09.661 --> 00:18:12.750
which was an outline of Jesus into which were written. The words.

309
00:18:12.900 --> 00:18:16.260
Sometimes I spit for fun on my mother's portrait.

310
00:18:16.440 --> 00:18:18.210
His father never forgave him after that,

311
00:18:18.270 --> 00:18:20.070
despite living within sight of each other,

312
00:18:20.190 --> 00:18:23.220
none of Donnelly's family ever visited the house he shared with gala.

313
00:18:23.370 --> 00:18:25.830
The loss of his sister was an especially deep.

314
00:18:32.660 --> 00:18:33.740
If it's not yet clear,

315
00:18:34.130 --> 00:18:38.930
Dani is not a reliable authority on the subject of Dali being such keen expert

316
00:18:38.931 --> 00:18:39.830
of self promotion.

317
00:18:39.831 --> 00:18:43.880
He used every interview as an opportunity to sell a vision of himself as the

318
00:18:44.300 --> 00:18:47.930
artist genius, for example, he probably never smashed on his mother's portrait.

319
00:18:47.960 --> 00:18:50.240
For any reason. He denied supporting Hitler,

320
00:18:50.420 --> 00:18:55.370
even as he included his face in major works. He never clearly denounced fascism.

321
00:18:55.371 --> 00:18:59.090
And instead described himself as a monarchist anarchist in his system.

322
00:18:59.091 --> 00:19:02.900
The King should rule absolutely under which the people could enjoy the freedom

323
00:19:02.901 --> 00:19:06.290
of absolute anarchy. Is that contradictory? Well, yes, of course.

324
00:19:06.291 --> 00:19:08.480
This is Salvador Dali, the Madmen money blue day,

325
00:19:08.481 --> 00:19:11.330
lobster to a telephone and sold it for a million dollars.

326
00:19:11.450 --> 00:19:15.200
It's also exactly the sort of philosophy that would appeal to the divorced ultra

327
00:19:15.201 --> 00:19:19.010
rich used to experiencing life as an extended orgy.

328
00:19:19.011 --> 00:19:23.120
So expect a revival of monarchist anarchism on goop penny day.

329
00:19:23.120 --> 00:19:27.320
Now when the other surreal is dragged him before a kangaroo court and accused

330
00:19:27.321 --> 00:19:28.610
him of fascists sympathies,

331
00:19:28.890 --> 00:19:31.370
he faint illness and showed up wearing too many sweaters.

332
00:19:31.460 --> 00:19:35.570
He would pause his self-defense to take his own temperature, shed layers, Don,

333
00:19:35.571 --> 00:19:36.590
or doff socks,

334
00:19:36.591 --> 00:19:40.820
and do whatever it took to highlight the farcical nature of the proceedings.

335
00:19:40.910 --> 00:19:44.570
His politics remain a major points of contention for both fans and attract us

336
00:19:44.810 --> 00:19:47.780
fascism would have interrupted his ability to enjoy himself.

337
00:19:47.781 --> 00:19:50.300
So it's easy to read his comments, insincerely.

338
00:19:50.540 --> 00:19:54.590
Maybe they were Prato trawling saying the opposite of what his lefty friends

339
00:19:54.680 --> 00:19:57.470
were saying. Just to get attention. However later in life,

340
00:19:57.830 --> 00:20:00.200
Dolly would voice support for general Francisco Franco,

341
00:20:00.201 --> 00:20:05.090
the brutal Spanish dictator calling him the only intelligent man in politics.

342
00:20:05.240 --> 00:20:09.170
When he said this Franco was busy killing 200,000 of his own citizens while

343
00:20:09.171 --> 00:20:13.940
imprisoning 500,000 more. That's not even defensible Assata.

344
00:20:14.120 --> 00:20:17.210
Pablo Picasso turned his back on Dolly and refused to speak to him again.

345
00:20:17.270 --> 00:20:19.730
The surrealists issue to pamphlets announcing Dolly,

346
00:20:19.731 --> 00:20:24.290
and he became persona non grata in the movements and Epic troll. Indeed.

347
00:20:31.100 --> 00:20:31.370
<v 1>Curious.</v>

348
00:20:31.370 --> 00:20:35.450
<v 0>Silly enough. His most controversial act is one your least likely to hear about.</v>

349
00:20:35.570 --> 00:20:40.430
As we mentioned, deli had unconventional sexual practices being rich and famous.

350
00:20:40.431 --> 00:20:45.110
He had no shortage of willing partners with one tragically notable exception in

351
00:20:45.111 --> 00:20:45.950
1945,

352
00:20:46.250 --> 00:20:50.830
Dolly was introduced to the Constance Webb by a mutual acquaintance and he was

353
00:20:50.831 --> 00:20:52.060
instantly charmed.

354
00:20:52.180 --> 00:20:55.480
She agreed to Moto for it and providing inspiration for some figures in the film

355
00:20:55.500 --> 00:20:56.290
spell downs.

356
00:20:56.290 --> 00:21:00.250
She described him as a perfect gentleman during the sessions together slowly

357
00:21:00.280 --> 00:21:04.270
coaxing her into working with less and less clothing after their final session.

358
00:21:04.271 --> 00:21:07.360
However, she was relaxing with her arm over our eyes,

359
00:21:07.361 --> 00:21:10.960
and he jumped upon our stomach and upon our breasts,

360
00:21:10.990 --> 00:21:14.350
which she began licking up. She quit muddling for him immediately.

361
00:21:14.351 --> 00:21:18.340
Afterwards only divulging the facts of her assault in interviews after the

362
00:21:18.341 --> 00:21:19.390
artist's death.

363
00:21:19.570 --> 00:21:23.230
This wasn't even his first time crossing that kind of physical line as a young

364
00:21:23.231 --> 00:21:25.300
man, women complimented his beautiful feet.

365
00:21:25.420 --> 00:21:30.340
So he responded by trampling her and only stops when his friends pulled him off

366
00:21:30.341 --> 00:21:33.490
of that. If there was a me too movement in the 1940s,

367
00:21:33.610 --> 00:21:36.520
maybe Dolly would be remembered a little bit differently.

368
00:21:36.670 --> 00:21:41.440
Instead he's much more likely to be rebuked for selling out as if the greatest

369
00:21:41.441 --> 00:21:45.550
moral failing of his life were the advertising campaigns for things like a leg

370
00:21:45.850 --> 00:21:49.540
wear and lollipops. He was the one who designs the current chopper chops logo,

371
00:21:49.541 --> 00:21:53.830
and even insisted on displaying the logo at the top of the pop to ensure that

372
00:21:53.831 --> 00:21:55.120
it's correctly represented.

373
00:22:01.380 --> 00:22:05.520
The question of separating the arts from the artist is ultimately one of

374
00:22:05.521 --> 00:22:09.660
measuring exactly how much misery we're willing to tolerate from creators.

375
00:22:09.750 --> 00:22:11.340
As in exchange for entertainment,

376
00:22:11.550 --> 00:22:15.480
the justification being that this sort of abuse is the price of genius rather

377
00:22:15.481 --> 00:22:17.280
than the side effect of privilege.

378
00:22:17.370 --> 00:22:21.030
Or maybe we all just want to believe that we can get good enough at something,

379
00:22:21.180 --> 00:22:24.300
but the laws of society no longer apply either way.

380
00:22:24.420 --> 00:22:28.560
There's no better place to be an inscrutable genius than the United States.

381
00:22:28.561 --> 00:22:31.860
So well off, he went after moving to America to escape.

382
00:22:31.861 --> 00:22:34.710
The second world war Dolly found great success in New York,

383
00:22:34.711 --> 00:22:38.130
but this proved insufficient to satisfy his hunger for fame.

384
00:22:38.370 --> 00:22:40.260
He had his eyes set on Hollywood.

385
00:22:40.440 --> 00:22:43.950
Having already made a name for himself in cinema circles with the famous

386
00:22:43.951 --> 00:22:46.290
isolating scene from his first movie,

387
00:22:46.530 --> 00:22:48.960
she and under low and delusion dog.

388
00:22:49.140 --> 00:22:52.380
It was easy for Dolly to meet people who could open doors for him.

389
00:22:52.440 --> 00:22:55.170
He was welcomed to California with open arms. Oh,

390
00:22:55.500 --> 00:22:58.860
he's in wallets after painting a few portraits for rich well-connected

391
00:22:58.861 --> 00:22:59.431
socialites,

392
00:22:59.431 --> 00:23:03.000
he was introduced to Alfred Hitchcock and listed Donnie's help for the elaborate

393
00:23:03.001 --> 00:23:05.520
dream sequences in the new auth Thrilla spell spellbound,

394
00:23:05.610 --> 00:23:08.070
sadly only two minutes out of 20 maidens.

395
00:23:08.071 --> 00:23:11.820
The final count of the film and the rest of the footage has been lost a time.

396
00:23:12.390 --> 00:23:15.720
Hitchcock sought out Dolly, not for the press, but because according to him,

397
00:23:15.750 --> 00:23:19.830
no one could better represent the vividness of dreams prior to Dali cinematic,

398
00:23:19.831 --> 00:23:22.080
dream sequences, Misty Vega,

399
00:23:22.081 --> 00:23:26.970
Fez themes and motives were hinted out from behind the layer of plausible

400
00:23:26.971 --> 00:23:28.410
deniability sequence.

401
00:23:28.420 --> 00:23:32.520
Designing for Hollywood is quite the step up from instigating art rights in

402
00:23:32.521 --> 00:23:37.170
Paris. Even if the final project failed to deliver the artists full of vision in

403
00:23:37.171 --> 00:23:38.100
1976,

404
00:23:38.670 --> 00:23:42.720
Dollywood write and direct impressions of upper Golia a documentary about the

405
00:23:42.721 --> 00:23:45.440
search for an enormous psychedelic mushroom.

406
00:23:45.500 --> 00:23:49.310
The climax of the film involves an elaborate flyover of an impossibly colored

407
00:23:49.340 --> 00:23:50.390
alien landscape,

408
00:23:50.420 --> 00:23:55.400
which upon a slow zoom out is revealed to be a Tanisha bras bands on

409
00:23:55.401 --> 00:23:55.881
a pen.

410
00:23:55.881 --> 00:24:00.500
Dolly had spent a week peeing on it is likely through no small coincidence.

411
00:24:00.501 --> 00:24:01.580
The ideal film.

412
00:24:02.380 --> 00:24:03.250
<v 1>Swallow mushrooms.</v>

413
00:24:10.330 --> 00:24:13.720
<v 0>His life was marked by tragic fleecing of the millions he earned in his life,</v>

414
00:24:14.110 --> 00:24:16.030
precious little remains of his estate near the end.

415
00:24:16.300 --> 00:24:19.570
He was investigated by the American IRS for tax absurdities.

416
00:24:19.690 --> 00:24:21.300
His hands started to shake so much.

417
00:24:21.430 --> 00:24:24.070
He was often unable to perform the exacting strokes.

418
00:24:24.071 --> 00:24:26.560
He based his work upon after Garland's death,

419
00:24:26.590 --> 00:24:30.580
her body was smuggled back to pupil or wrapped in a blanket in the back of a car

420
00:24:30.600 --> 00:24:32.200
and interned in the console.

421
00:24:32.440 --> 00:24:35.470
She spent so much of our life and as his own health started to fail some

422
00:24:35.471 --> 00:24:39.370
opportunists in Dolly's social circles, seize the opportunity to pilfer,

423
00:24:39.400 --> 00:24:42.460
whatever they could. Money went missing a boarder in his childhood home,

424
00:24:42.461 --> 00:24:45.970
walked off with briefcases full of personal papers and sketches claiming they

425
00:24:45.971 --> 00:24:48.070
were to be documented and photographed in Paris.

426
00:24:48.400 --> 00:24:49.810
Of course they were never seen again,

427
00:24:49.960 --> 00:24:54.010
delirious Dolly would sign whatever canvases and lithograph sheets were pressed

428
00:24:54.011 --> 00:24:57.970
in his hands. And the market was flooded with forged art to this day.

429
00:24:58.090 --> 00:25:02.020
Rumors of newly discovered Dolly masterpieces are usually just convincing fakes

430
00:25:02.290 --> 00:25:05.020
drawn up on a pre-signed sheet up to 50,000.

431
00:25:05.021 --> 00:25:09.430
Such works may have been created and the bulk still remain at large instead of

432
00:25:09.431 --> 00:25:13.180
consigning the works to Spain through his foundation in the Dali museum,

433
00:25:13.270 --> 00:25:15.880
as he declared earlier, dollies signed papers,

434
00:25:15.881 --> 00:25:19.720
seeding copyright to a corporation owns by a time business partner,

435
00:25:19.840 --> 00:25:22.630
even in death Dolly's life was marked by irony.

436
00:25:22.750 --> 00:25:26.290
His initial plan was to construct a team adjacent the gala's resting place with

437
00:25:26.350 --> 00:25:29.530
the hole between them such that they could hold hands in the afterlife.

438
00:25:29.650 --> 00:25:33.880
Instead the mayor of figure intervenes just hours before Delaney's death and

439
00:25:33.881 --> 00:25:37.960
claims that the artist had charged him with moving the final resting place to

440
00:25:37.961 --> 00:25:42.820
the Dani theater and museum conveniently giving us a huge tourist attraction.

441
00:25:43.360 --> 00:25:47.230
And that was the end of Dali. And I really hope you enjoyed today's video.
