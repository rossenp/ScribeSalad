00:00:00.480 --> 00:00:04.120
<v 0>Franklin Delano Roosevelt was the longest serving president in us history.</v>

2
00:00:04.121 --> 00:00:07.840
Serving 12 years in office from 1933 to 1945.

3
00:00:08.060 --> 00:00:12.200
He steered the nation through its worst economic crisis only to be faced with

4
00:00:12.201 --> 00:00:16.120
the most horrific war in history though, facing Titanic,

5
00:00:16.520 --> 00:00:17.680
physical challenges of his own.

6
00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:22.630
He imbued America with the indomitable Fort you and sense of morale that was

7
00:00:22.631 --> 00:00:26.310
required to spur the nation onto victory in today's biographics.

8
00:00:26.311 --> 00:00:30.870
We examine the inspirational life of the 30 seconds presidents of the United

9
00:00:30.870 --> 00:00:32.870
States. Franklin Delano Roosevelt

10
00:00:45.340 --> 00:00:48.380
Franklin Deno Roosevelt was born on January the 30th, 1882,

11
00:00:48.381 --> 00:00:52.780
the only child of James and Sarah and Deno Roosevelt in Hyde park,

12
00:00:53.080 --> 00:00:53.630
New York,

13
00:00:53.630 --> 00:00:57.380
James recorded the event in his diary that day rising at quarter to nine.

14
00:00:57.480 --> 00:01:01.850
My Sally had a S splendid large boy. That was unconscious when he was born.

15
00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:06.210
Baby weighs 10 pounds without clothes. It was not an easy birth.

16
00:01:06.550 --> 00:01:11.130
In fact, both mother and baby nearly died due to the administration of too much

17
00:01:11.180 --> 00:01:15.290
chloroform by the doctor. Ah, good old medicine back in the day,

18
00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:19.730
despite being born, not breathing. Franklin went on to become a healthy child.

19
00:01:20.030 --> 00:01:24.360
He was raised in a privileged living in an impressive estate that had been in

20
00:01:24.361 --> 00:01:25.880
the Roosevelt family for more than a century.

21
00:01:26.180 --> 00:01:30.680
The Roosevelts were of Dutch extraction. Having immigrated in 1654,

22
00:01:30.790 --> 00:01:35.680
they became an American success story due largely to development in the coal and

23
00:01:35.681 --> 00:01:38.080
transportation industries. Franklin's father, uh,

24
00:01:38.081 --> 00:01:41.520
Harvard law school graduate served as the vice president of the Delaware and

25
00:01:41.521 --> 00:01:42.440
Hudson railway,

26
00:01:42.830 --> 00:01:46.550
and also served as presidents for the Southern railway security company,

27
00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:49.990
his income and his inheritance allowed him to retire, to focus on his health,

28
00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:53.990
which had never been very good. Sarah Delano note was the second wife of James.

29
00:01:54.290 --> 00:01:57.350
Her existence revolved around caring for a son as a result.

30
00:01:57.351 --> 00:02:00.110
<v 7>The majority of Franklin's early childhood was spent in the company of his</v>

31
00:02:00.111 --> 00:02:02.910
mother. Sarah was an overly protective parent. She,

32
00:02:03.260 --> 00:02:06.780
he came to feel resentful of anyone. You got to close to Franklin. Meanwhile,

33
00:02:06.790 --> 00:02:09.980
James was often the absent father, Jan Franklin, though.

34
00:02:09.981 --> 00:02:12.780
He did benefit from the privileges of wealth and position.

35
00:02:12.970 --> 00:02:16.100
When he was five years old, he visited the white house with his father,

36
00:02:16.101 --> 00:02:19.340
president gro Cleveland spoke to him personally saying,

37
00:02:19.820 --> 00:02:21.540
I have just one wish for you. Young man,

38
00:02:21.690 --> 00:02:25.050
that he will never be president's of the United States.

39
00:02:31.490 --> 00:02:33.730
<v 0>Franklin didn't attend school. Lynn state,</v>

40
00:02:33.890 --> 00:02:35.970
his father employed a private tutor for him.

41
00:02:36.030 --> 00:02:39.570
He was an able student who applied himself to his lessons each summer Franklin

42
00:02:39.670 --> 00:02:43.530
and Sarah would vacation at the Deno homestead in Fairhaven, Massachusetts.

43
00:02:43.970 --> 00:02:46.680
There would also be an annual trip to Europe. During these days,

44
00:02:46.920 --> 00:02:49.920
Franklin learned to speak German and French. As he grew older,

45
00:02:50.240 --> 00:02:51.920
Franklin became an avid sportsman.

46
00:02:51.940 --> 00:02:56.040
He played lawn tennis and polo and rode horses and learned to shoot a rifle in

47
00:02:56.041 --> 00:02:58.200
his teens. He also took to golf and sailing.

48
00:02:58.260 --> 00:03:01.720
It was customary for children of privilege to attend boarding school at the age

49
00:03:01.721 --> 00:03:02.260
of 12.

50
00:03:02.260 --> 00:03:06.880
But Sarah considered that her glorious boy was not yet ready to take such a big

51
00:03:06.950 --> 00:03:09.720
step and delayed the move for two years at 14,

52
00:03:09.780 --> 00:03:13.360
she enrolled him at the Grotton Episcopal school at Grotton, Massachusetts.

53
00:03:13.590 --> 00:03:17.280
This school was attended by the children of the most privileged people,

54
00:03:17.720 --> 00:03:18.553
although it was a,

55
00:03:18.590 --> 00:03:21.910
a Franklin to suddenly be away from the protective care of his mother.

56
00:03:22.170 --> 00:03:23.870
He soon adjusted dormitory life.

57
00:03:23.890 --> 00:03:26.910
He played a number of sports and became a member of the school debating team,

58
00:03:27.130 --> 00:03:28.070
as well as the choir.

59
00:03:28.290 --> 00:03:32.110
He graduated from the school in June of 1900 with grades sufficiently impressive

60
00:03:32.130 --> 00:03:36.270
to secure a spot at Harvard university in Cambridge, Massachusetts,

61
00:03:36.870 --> 00:03:40.180
a Harvard man, Franklin became very socially active during his first year.

62
00:03:40.360 --> 00:03:43.740
He joins a number of clubs on campus and began writing for the Harvard college

63
00:03:43.741 --> 00:03:46.460
newspaper. He excelled in the college environment,

64
00:03:46.660 --> 00:03:51.260
becoming a confidence and a popular student towards the end of 1900 Franklin's

65
00:03:51.261 --> 00:03:55.420
father James. He died a year later. Another death profoundly affected him.

66
00:03:55.421 --> 00:03:58.420
President William McKinley was killed by an Assassin's bullet,

67
00:03:58.720 --> 00:04:01.090
an act which upheld Franklin's distant cousin,

68
00:04:01.290 --> 00:04:03.090
Theodore Roosevelt to the white house.

69
00:04:03.480 --> 00:04:07.210
This change of event served to peak Franklin's interest in his family history.

70
00:04:07.310 --> 00:04:11.370
He wrote a college paper titled the Roosevelts of new Amsterdam and studied the

71
00:04:11.371 --> 00:04:13.690
notations in the old Dutch family Bible.

72
00:04:20.040 --> 00:04:23.800
After three years at Harvard Roosevelt was ready to graduate yet he chose to

73
00:04:23.801 --> 00:04:27.280
stay on for another year in order to work as the chief editor of the Harvard

74
00:04:27.390 --> 00:04:29.960
Crimson newspaper. One day in the summer of 1902,

75
00:04:29.961 --> 00:04:33.600
he was heading back to the family mansion Hyde park from New York when he

76
00:04:33.840 --> 00:04:38.040
happened upon an 18 year old ele Roosevelt. And yes, she did share his name.

77
00:04:38.060 --> 00:04:40.440
She was in fact, a distant relative of his, the two.

78
00:04:40.660 --> 00:04:43.070
They hit it off immediately. And from that chance,

79
00:04:43.100 --> 00:04:45.350
encount romance blossomed Franklin.

80
00:04:45.610 --> 00:04:49.950
He was captivated by Ellen's intellectual depth into social conscious things.

81
00:04:50.190 --> 00:04:53.590
They got serious in 1903 with Franklin who was now studying Laura at Columbia

82
00:04:53.720 --> 00:04:56.110
university, asking felons hand in marriage.

83
00:04:56.290 --> 00:04:59.870
She eagerly agreed and wanted the wedding to take place. As soon as possible.

84
00:05:00.350 --> 00:05:04.420
Franklin's mother Sarah was not happy with her son's choice of bride,

85
00:05:04.421 --> 00:05:08.740
whether she had something specifically against the independently minded Eleanor,

86
00:05:08.760 --> 00:05:13.340
or she felt threatened by any woman getting between her and her beloved boy.

87
00:05:13.570 --> 00:05:18.100
Well, that song clear. She convinced Franklin to at least delay the wedding,

88
00:05:18.101 --> 00:05:23.010
which took place on March the 17th of 1905 ele who was an orphan was given

89
00:05:23.011 --> 00:05:26.730
away by her uncle. And that would be president Theodore Roosevelt,

90
00:05:26.950 --> 00:05:30.010
the young uncle honeymoons in Europe upon return to New York,

91
00:05:30.290 --> 00:05:34.050
Franklin returned to his law studies at Columbia university in may of 1906.

92
00:05:34.490 --> 00:05:37.610
Eleena gave birth to their first child who they named Anna Eleanor.

93
00:05:37.670 --> 00:05:40.650
The following year, Franklin passed the New York state bar exam.

94
00:05:40.750 --> 00:05:44.720
He secured his first up as a law clerk. It's a prominent New York law firm.

95
00:05:44.840 --> 00:05:45.450
A second child.

96
00:05:45.450 --> 00:05:49.640
James came along in December of 1907 during 1907 Franklin's mother.

97
00:05:49.690 --> 00:05:54.280
Sarah had been financing the building of a double house on 65th street in New

98
00:05:54.280 --> 00:05:54.540
York.

99
00:05:54.540 --> 00:05:58.960
It was to be a present couple with her living in one house and them living in

100
00:05:58.961 --> 00:06:00.120
the other, the living spaces,

101
00:06:00.150 --> 00:06:04.920
they were separated by a single door while grateful ele was frustrated at the

102
00:06:04.921 --> 00:06:07.000
way that Sarah was smothering their marriage,

103
00:06:07.001 --> 00:06:09.800
making decisions that should have been Ella's domain.

104
00:06:09.990 --> 00:06:12.440
This was a difficult time in Ella's life.

105
00:06:12.720 --> 00:06:14.960
Children were coming along regularly yet.

106
00:06:14.980 --> 00:06:17.430
She admitted that she was not a natural mother.

107
00:06:17.730 --> 00:06:20.510
She went so far as to write that she did not even like her children.

108
00:06:20.930 --> 00:06:23.950
She hired a nanny and spent more time on local New York social issues,

109
00:06:23.951 --> 00:06:26.630
such as working for improved factory conditions for workers.

110
00:06:33.070 --> 00:06:36.110
Franklin's first far into politics. It came in 1910.

111
00:06:36.111 --> 00:06:38.860
When he became leg to the New York democratic state committee,

112
00:06:38.960 --> 00:06:42.540
he was then asked if he wanted to run for the office of state assemblyman.

113
00:06:42.740 --> 00:06:46.020
It was assumed that the sitting assemblyman was about to retire Frank.

114
00:06:46.240 --> 00:06:47.140
He was infused,

115
00:06:47.141 --> 00:06:50.780
but then he found out that the incumbents was not planning to retire at all.

116
00:06:50.830 --> 00:06:54.540
There was though an opening to run for New York state Senator with no

117
00:06:54.541 --> 00:06:56.300
experience, but plenty of enthusiasm.

118
00:06:56.301 --> 00:07:00.330
He began a grassy campaign that soon endeared him to the working people of the

119
00:07:00.331 --> 00:07:03.530
city. He faced an uphill battle with the state being decidedly Republican.

120
00:07:03.531 --> 00:07:04.810
However, on election day,

121
00:07:04.811 --> 00:07:08.370
he found himself ahead by a thousand votes and he was suddenly the New York

122
00:07:08.380 --> 00:07:09.213
state Senator.

123
00:07:09.350 --> 00:07:12.570
The Roosevelts now rented out their house in New York city and moved to the

124
00:07:12.571 --> 00:07:14.330
state capital in Albany, New York,

125
00:07:14.970 --> 00:07:17.930
Franklin though he soon became embroils in political intrigue,

126
00:07:18.200 --> 00:07:23.040
a powerful faction of the New York democratic party known as Taney hall had run

127
00:07:23.041 --> 00:07:27.320
the party for decades. Roosevelt. However was not one to do what he was told.

128
00:07:27.540 --> 00:07:29.800
He was not going to be anybody's puppet.

129
00:07:30.060 --> 00:07:33.440
He stated his opposition to the Taney hall group and built his own support

130
00:07:33.441 --> 00:07:38.040
network who were known in the papers as the little group of insurgents through

131
00:07:38.041 --> 00:07:40.590
his adherence principal and his refusal to bag down.

132
00:07:40.620 --> 00:07:44.950
Roosevelt developed a reputation as a man who would stand up his beliefs as his

133
00:07:44.951 --> 00:07:48.630
first term drew to a close though. Roosevelt was struck down by typhoid fever,

134
00:07:48.800 --> 00:07:50.830
which has a 20% death rate.

135
00:07:51.050 --> 00:07:54.110
He recovered though and vigorously campaigned for a second term.

136
00:07:54.350 --> 00:07:58.670
As New York state Senator, he won this one by 1,700 votes.

137
00:08:04.810 --> 00:08:09.260
Roosevelt was a supporter of Woodrow Wilson who won the presidency in 1912.

138
00:08:09.261 --> 00:08:10.540
Wilson said about rewarding.

139
00:08:10.541 --> 00:08:14.620
Those who had stood by him and you course Roosevelt was offered the position of

140
00:08:14.621 --> 00:08:16.140
assistant secretary of the Navy.

141
00:08:16.360 --> 00:08:20.650
It was the same position that his distant cousin Theodore had held a in 1897.

142
00:08:21.050 --> 00:08:24.530
Franklin now gave up his state Senate seat to take on the new role.

143
00:08:24.680 --> 00:08:28.970
Roosevelt's job had him traveling the country to inspect ships and Naval yards.

144
00:08:29.030 --> 00:08:32.210
He soon discovered that the Navy was really quite ill prepared for war,

145
00:08:32.350 --> 00:08:35.690
and he campaigned for the creation of a Naval reserve of 50,000 men.

146
00:08:35.860 --> 00:08:39.370
Along with increased spending on ship building Roosevelt didn't seem to care

147
00:08:39.371 --> 00:08:42.280
that his words, their actions were not politically expedient.

148
00:08:42.460 --> 00:08:45.120
His only interest seemed to be bolstering. The Navy.

149
00:08:45.350 --> 00:08:48.800
This attitude is earned in respects across the political spectrum with the

150
00:08:48.880 --> 00:08:51.400
outbreak of war in Europe. In August of 1914,

151
00:08:51.550 --> 00:08:55.760
Roosevelt became even more dedicated to his work of building up the us Navy.

152
00:08:55.940 --> 00:09:00.320
He excelled in the role and won many advantages for the Navy with the 1916

153
00:09:00.321 --> 00:09:03.160
presidential election Roosevelt's future. It hung in the balance.

154
00:09:03.500 --> 00:09:04.920
If Wilson was returned to office,

155
00:09:05.020 --> 00:09:08.320
he would no doubt retain his position as assistant Navy secretary.

156
00:09:08.340 --> 00:09:10.320
But if a Republican moved into the white house,

157
00:09:10.460 --> 00:09:14.400
he would more than likely be unceremoniously dumped. It was an,

158
00:09:14.750 --> 00:09:18.230
an extremely closely fought race with Roosevelt later,

159
00:09:18.231 --> 00:09:22.390
describing it as the most extraordinary day of my life. At the end of the day,

160
00:09:22.391 --> 00:09:26.870
Wilson won out to retain the presidency and Roosevelt's job was secure with

161
00:09:26.871 --> 00:09:30.950
America's entry into the war in 1917, his position, it took on more urgency.

162
00:09:31.090 --> 00:09:35.660
He was instrumental in the drive to illit public donations for the war at as

163
00:09:35.661 --> 00:09:38.820
well as the development of mind, detonation technology,

164
00:09:39.040 --> 00:09:43.140
the pressures of his work kept Roosevelt away from his family for increasingly

165
00:09:43.141 --> 00:09:44.100
long pressures of time.

166
00:09:44.200 --> 00:09:46.860
He began an affair with the social secretary of his wife.

167
00:09:47.380 --> 00:09:49.700
Eleena that would continue on and off into his death.

168
00:09:49.880 --> 00:09:53.220
The women's name was Lucy Meer sometime in around 1918,

169
00:09:53.580 --> 00:09:56.970
ele found the letters between the two they field that Franklin was planning to

170
00:09:56.971 --> 00:09:59.490
divorce her and making you life with Lucy. However,

171
00:09:59.730 --> 00:10:02.530
Franklin's mother refused to permit such a scandals or warning her son,

172
00:10:02.531 --> 00:10:04.330
that it would ruin his political career.

173
00:10:04.560 --> 00:10:08.090
From that point on Roosevelt's marriage was one of expedience and convenience.

174
00:10:08.930 --> 00:10:11.650
Ele sued set up a separate home in Hyde park for her in the children.

175
00:10:11.710 --> 00:10:13.690
And she threw herself into a social work.

176
00:10:13.870 --> 00:10:18.120
The break in their marriage was so severe that Roosevelt asked Eleanor in 1942

177
00:10:18.121 --> 00:10:20.160
to come back and live with him due to his poor health.

178
00:10:20.500 --> 00:10:25.200
She refused in September of 1918 Roosevelt made a state visit to France and

179
00:10:25.201 --> 00:10:28.760
Britain to inspect Naval facilities on the return trip on board,

180
00:10:28.761 --> 00:10:32.480
the USS lava and the influenza pandemic. It ran through the ship.

181
00:10:32.680 --> 00:10:35.440
A number of people died and Roosevelt became very ill. However,

182
00:10:35.580 --> 00:10:37.350
he recovered before he reached New York.

183
00:10:43.020 --> 00:10:47.190
Following the ends of hostilities in 1918 Roosevelt began looking towards his

184
00:10:47.191 --> 00:10:49.510
next run for office. After March consultation,

185
00:10:49.511 --> 00:10:52.750
he decided to campaign for the democratic vice presidential nomination.

186
00:10:53.010 --> 00:10:56.750
His bid was successful and he found himself on the ticket alongside a Ohio

187
00:10:58.020 --> 00:10:59.540
James Cox, who was running for presidents,

188
00:10:59.570 --> 00:11:03.140
Roosevelt resigned as assistant secretary to the Navy and spent the next year

189
00:11:03.141 --> 00:11:05.460
and a half on the campaign trail. The 1920 election,

190
00:11:05.640 --> 00:11:09.700
it ended up being a resounding victory for the Republicans with Warren G

191
00:11:09.701 --> 00:11:11.100
Harding, securing the presidency,

192
00:11:16.650 --> 00:11:18.810
Roosevelt accepted the loss with grace.

193
00:11:18.830 --> 00:11:23.210
He returned to New York to pick up his law practice. In August of 1921,

194
00:11:23.230 --> 00:11:26.130
the family were vacationing at Campobello islands.

195
00:11:26.131 --> 00:11:27.810
When he was struck down with an illness,

196
00:11:28.110 --> 00:11:31.730
it was believed that he had contracted poliomyelitis with a condition,

197
00:11:31.740 --> 00:11:33.370
paralyzing him from the waist down.

198
00:11:33.480 --> 00:11:36.970
More recent analysis suggests that it may in fact have been an autoimmune

199
00:11:36.971 --> 00:11:38.880
disease called GUI bar syndrome.

200
00:11:39.130 --> 00:11:43.160
Sarah urged her son to retire and live out his life in retirement,

201
00:11:43.460 --> 00:11:46.120
but his closest advisors, including wife, Eleanor,

202
00:11:46.121 --> 00:11:48.880
they felt otherwise he should continue with his public career,

203
00:11:48.881 --> 00:11:52.560
which they assured him was on a trajectory towards the white house,

204
00:11:52.790 --> 00:11:56.280
thus encouraged. He spent the next few years in physical rehabilitation.

205
00:11:56.540 --> 00:11:57.720
If he couldn't walk unaided,

206
00:11:57.740 --> 00:12:00.040
he would at least project that impression to the public.

207
00:12:00.260 --> 00:12:04.200
He taught himself to walk a few paces with metal braces on his hips and with the

208
00:12:04.320 --> 00:12:04.940
aid of a cane,

209
00:12:04.940 --> 00:12:09.200
he was determined that the public would not see him in a wheelchair. In 1926,

210
00:12:09.201 --> 00:12:13.030
Roosevelt financed the building of a hydrotherapy debilitation clinic in warm

211
00:12:13.140 --> 00:12:13.973
Springs, Georgia.

212
00:12:14.210 --> 00:12:17.870
He spent much of his time there throughout the remainder of the 1920s during his

213
00:12:17.920 --> 00:12:21.190
rehab years, Roosevelt maintained close contact with the democratic party.

214
00:12:21.380 --> 00:12:24.710
Then in 19 20 80 reluctantly ran the governor of New York.

215
00:12:24.850 --> 00:12:27.150
He won by a margin of just 1%.

216
00:12:27.330 --> 00:12:31.270
His governorship was marked by a focus on innovative infrastructure projects,

217
00:12:31.271 --> 00:12:35.900
such as hydrostatic power plans and the institution of his far side chats during

218
00:12:35.901 --> 00:12:39.140
which he spoke directly over the radio to the people of New York winning

219
00:12:39.141 --> 00:12:40.340
reelection in 1930,

220
00:12:40.341 --> 00:12:44.140
Roosevelt introduced an economic relief package to help the millions suffering

221
00:12:44.141 --> 00:12:45.820
from the side effects of the depression.

222
00:12:45.821 --> 00:12:49.180
He also established a number of commissions through root out public corruption.

223
00:12:55.550 --> 00:12:56.650
As the popular two term,

224
00:12:56.810 --> 00:13:00.770
governor of the country's most dynamic state Roosevelt was a front runner for

225
00:13:00.771 --> 00:13:03.650
the democratic presidential nomination. In 1932,

226
00:13:03.710 --> 00:13:07.050
he won the nomination at the democratic national convention in his acceptance

227
00:13:07.051 --> 00:13:08.730
speech. He promised I pledge you.

228
00:13:08.890 --> 00:13:11.530
I pledge myself to a new deal for the American people.

229
00:13:11.640 --> 00:13:16.560
This is more than a political campaign is a call to arms Roosevelt,

230
00:13:16.620 --> 00:13:20.080
ran on a platform of government funded, public works, farm relief,

231
00:13:20.260 --> 00:13:23.920
and the appeal of prohibition on the strength of these policies and his winning

232
00:13:23.950 --> 00:13:24.783
personality.

233
00:13:24.820 --> 00:13:29.440
He won 57% of the popular vote to become the 32nd president of the

234
00:13:29.441 --> 00:13:30.274
United States.

235
00:13:30.290 --> 00:13:33.680
After taking the oath of office Roosevelt delivered his inaugural address,

236
00:13:33.790 --> 00:13:36.310
best known for it's famous line. So first.

237
00:13:36.330 --> 00:13:37.163
<v 6>Of all,</v>

238
00:13:37.890 --> 00:13:42.790
let me assert my firm belief that the only thing we have

239
00:13:42.930 --> 00:13:47.510
to fear is fear itself, nameless,

240
00:13:47.950 --> 00:13:50.070
unreasoning, unjustified terror,

241
00:13:51.030 --> 00:13:54.910
which paralyzes needed efforts to convert secret.

242
00:13:55.730 --> 00:13:56.563
<v 0>Into advance.</v>

243
00:13:56.630 --> 00:14:00.660
After the inaugural address a woman by the name of Sarah Love said any man who

244
00:14:00.661 --> 00:14:05.660
can talk like that in times like these is worthy of every ounce of support,

245
00:14:06.020 --> 00:14:10.340
a true American has Roosevelt assumed office in the midst of the greatest

246
00:14:10.410 --> 00:14:14.660
financial crisis, the, the United States has ever faced unemployment.

247
00:14:14.760 --> 00:14:15.810
It was 20. He,

248
00:14:16.450 --> 00:14:20.530
5% banks have closed all over the country and more than 2 million people were

249
00:14:20.690 --> 00:14:24.770
homeless Roosevelt dedicated himself to saving the nation he would do so by

250
00:14:24.771 --> 00:14:27.530
putting in place the relief programs of his first new deal.

251
00:14:27.670 --> 00:14:31.530
He restructured systems that were broken and this invigorated the spirit of his

252
00:14:31.531 --> 00:14:34.530
people and other key to this invigoration, whereas far side chats,

253
00:14:34.531 --> 00:14:36.010
which were something he continued from his go.

254
00:14:36.620 --> 00:14:39.240
He spoke to the American people as a loving father,

255
00:14:39.350 --> 00:14:42.800
full of optimism and of good ideas. During his first time,

256
00:14:42.801 --> 00:14:45.440
Roosevelt established a number of major relief initiatives.

257
00:14:45.450 --> 00:14:48.520
These included the federal relief administration and the public works

258
00:14:48.521 --> 00:14:49.201
administration,

259
00:14:49.201 --> 00:14:52.920
which provided an employment to a quarter of a million men throughout the

260
00:14:52.921 --> 00:14:56.680
country in August, 1935. He also signed the social security act,

261
00:14:56.681 --> 00:15:01.320
which included benefits for the unemployed and the elderly from 1935 Roosevelt

262
00:15:01.321 --> 00:15:04.920
embarked on his second new deal. Squarely focused on the business community.

263
00:15:05.150 --> 00:15:08.760
Wholesale changes were made to the banking industry and business in order to

264
00:15:08.761 --> 00:15:13.350
make things fairer to the everyday man by 1936 Roosevelt's policies and

265
00:15:13.351 --> 00:15:17.670
personality had made him one of the most popular presidents in all of history.

266
00:15:17.810 --> 00:15:18.990
The election that year,

267
00:15:19.130 --> 00:15:23.470
it was a landslide victory with the president taking every state except Maine

268
00:15:23.730 --> 00:15:27.390
and Vermont. During his second time, Roosevelt spent a lot of time in broiled,

269
00:15:27.391 --> 00:15:30.430
in legal challenges to many of the programs that he had brought in during his

270
00:15:30.431 --> 00:15:34.580
first time in 1936, the Supreme court was largely conservative. However,

271
00:15:34.680 --> 00:15:35.620
by 1941,

272
00:15:35.621 --> 00:15:39.940
Roosevelt had appointed seven of the nine justices with growing tension between

273
00:15:39.941 --> 00:15:44.220
Germany and the other European nations Roosevelt pursued a policy of us

274
00:15:44.260 --> 00:15:46.700
isolationism. However, by mid 1938,

275
00:15:46.701 --> 00:15:50.740
with public opinion in the us firmly against German aggression towards the Jews

276
00:15:51.020 --> 00:15:53.730
hit again, bill building up the military for the possibility of war.

277
00:15:53.880 --> 00:15:56.250
When the war broke out in September of 1939,

278
00:15:56.350 --> 00:16:00.690
he actively looked for opportunities to support Britain and France Roosevelt

279
00:16:00.691 --> 00:16:04.130
struck up a great friendship with Winston Churchill who became British prime

280
00:16:04.290 --> 00:16:06.290
minister in may of 1940, the United States.

281
00:16:06.291 --> 00:16:09.810
It began supplying an increasing number of armaments to the British while at the

282
00:16:09.811 --> 00:16:10.211
same time,

283
00:16:10.211 --> 00:16:14.360
continuing to build up its own war footing the fall of France after just six

284
00:16:14.361 --> 00:16:17.840
weeks, it was a shock to everyone in America. From that point forward,

285
00:16:18.020 --> 00:16:19.000
the majority of people,

286
00:16:19.030 --> 00:16:23.760
they were inclined towards American intervention in the European war in 1940

287
00:16:23.830 --> 00:16:27.120
Roosevelt made the decision to run for an unprecedented third term.

288
00:16:27.120 --> 00:16:30.600
As president, there had been a tradition of limiting presidents to two terms.

289
00:16:30.601 --> 00:16:31.230
However,

290
00:16:31.230 --> 00:16:35.350
Roosevelt was con convinced that a change of leadership in a time of approaching

291
00:16:35.370 --> 00:16:38.950
war would be disastrous for the country, throwing himself into their campaign.

292
00:16:39.090 --> 00:16:44.030
He won another overwhelming victory winning 85% of the popular

293
00:16:44.140 --> 00:16:48.110
vote and 38 of 48 states throughout 1941,

294
00:16:48.111 --> 00:16:50.390
Roosevelt became overtly critical of Hitler.

295
00:16:50.391 --> 00:16:54.060
He became furious when Hitler began threatening and shipping in the Atlantic

296
00:16:54.061 --> 00:16:54.840
declaring,

297
00:16:54.840 --> 00:16:59.420
we will not let Hitler prescribe the waters of the world on which our ships may

298
00:16:59.421 --> 00:17:03.620
travel. The American flag is not going to be driven from the seas either by his

299
00:17:03.621 --> 00:17:08.620
submarines, his airplanes or his threats. Then on December the seventh,

300
00:17:08.940 --> 00:17:09.610
1941,

301
00:17:09.610 --> 00:17:14.530
more than 350 Japanese fighter planes launched a sub attack on

302
00:17:14.531 --> 00:17:19.530
the us Naval base at Pearl Harbor, Hawaii. Some 3000 people lost their lives.

303
00:17:19.830 --> 00:17:24.130
Dozens of ships were sunk and many planes were destroyed as they just sat on the

304
00:17:24.131 --> 00:17:25.210
runway. The next day,

305
00:17:25.211 --> 00:17:29.250
president Roosevelt addressed Congress with these memorable words yesterday,

306
00:17:29.610 --> 00:17:32.770
December the seventh, 1941, a date which will live in infamy.

307
00:17:32.910 --> 00:17:37.040
The United States of America was suddenly and deliberately attacked by Naval and

308
00:17:37.100 --> 00:17:39.240
air forces of the empire of Japan.

309
00:17:39.500 --> 00:17:42.520
He then asked Congress to declare war on the empire of Japan,

310
00:17:42.521 --> 00:17:44.240
which it duly did within days.

311
00:17:44.241 --> 00:17:47.080
The declaration of war was extended to include Germany and Italy,

312
00:17:47.480 --> 00:17:48.313
Franklin Roosevelt.

313
00:17:48.420 --> 00:17:52.920
It was now a wartime precedent as the us war machine rolled into action with

314
00:17:52.921 --> 00:17:56.720
hundreds of thousands of men being sent to Europe and the Pacific theaters of

315
00:17:56.721 --> 00:17:59.960
war Roosevelt focused on building up morale on the home front,

316
00:18:00.180 --> 00:18:01.440
his main vehicle for achieving.

317
00:18:01.441 --> 00:18:04.840
This was still his far sight chats on February the 23rd, 1942.

318
00:18:04.960 --> 00:18:05.793
We told the nation.

319
00:18:06.160 --> 00:18:09.630
<v 6>Here are three high purposes for are every American</v>

320
00:18:11.490 --> 00:18:15.750
one. We shall not stop work for a single day.

321
00:18:16.690 --> 00:18:18.230
If any dispute arises,

322
00:18:18.290 --> 00:18:22.590
we shall keep on working while the dispute is solved by

323
00:18:22.700 --> 00:18:26.710
mediation or conciliation or arbitration

324
00:18:27.600 --> 00:18:31.900
until the R is one, two.

325
00:18:32.760 --> 00:18:37.660
We shall not demand special gains or special privileges or

326
00:18:37.661 --> 00:18:41.940
special advantages for any one group or

327
00:18:42.190 --> 00:18:44.340
occupation three.

328
00:18:45.200 --> 00:18:49.340
We shall give up conveniences and modify the routine of our,

329
00:18:50.550 --> 00:18:53.130
if our country asks us to do so,

330
00:18:54.430 --> 00:18:58.770
we will do it carefully remembering that the common enemy

331
00:18:59.620 --> 00:19:04.530
seeks to destroy every home and every freedom in every

332
00:19:04.680 --> 00:19:05.970
part of our land.

333
00:19:06.600 --> 00:19:08.290
<v 0>With the Americans having just entered the war.</v>

334
00:19:08.291 --> 00:19:12.160
The Russians won a decisive Vic tree in the battle of Stalin grant, the Nazis,

335
00:19:12.190 --> 00:19:15.640
they were finally being pushed back towards Berlin from the east Roosevelt,

336
00:19:15.920 --> 00:19:16.361
his generals.

337
00:19:16.361 --> 00:19:19.800
They were convinced that a similar push from the west would drive the Nazis into

338
00:19:19.801 --> 00:19:20.380
submission.

339
00:19:20.380 --> 00:19:25.040
The planning for a grand invasion of Western Europe had begun throughout 1942

340
00:19:25.041 --> 00:19:28.200
and 43 Roosevelt had a number of other meetings with allied leaders,

341
00:19:28.201 --> 00:19:31.190
including Churchill Stalin, and the Chinese leader,

342
00:19:31.710 --> 00:19:33.790
Chanka shack on June the fifth, 1944,

343
00:19:33.791 --> 00:19:36.830
president Roosevelts addressed the American people with the following news

344
00:19:37.140 --> 00:19:41.950
yesterday on June 4th, 1944, Rome fell to American and allied troops.

345
00:19:42.010 --> 00:19:46.270
The first of the access capitals is now in our hands. One up two to go.

346
00:19:46.690 --> 00:19:50.070
The following day and major step was taken in taking out the biggest access

347
00:19:50.071 --> 00:19:53.020
power on the more of June the sixth, 1944,

348
00:19:53.100 --> 00:19:56.460
hundreds of thousands of allied troops landed on the beaches of Normandy.

349
00:19:56.470 --> 00:19:59.900
After fierce fighting the German army, it was pushed back now,

350
00:19:59.901 --> 00:20:02.380
the Nazis they were being squeezed from both sides.

351
00:20:02.560 --> 00:20:05.420
It was now clear to Roosevelt that an allied victory was coming.

352
00:20:05.640 --> 00:20:09.100
He began to place his focus on the logistics of that victory.

353
00:20:09.200 --> 00:20:12.130
He spoke of the allies as a group of United I nations.

354
00:20:12.270 --> 00:20:16.730
He was convinced that only a worldwide union of nations could prevent a future

355
00:20:16.830 --> 00:20:20.370
war. Roosevelt's championing of what was to become the United nations.

356
00:20:20.371 --> 00:20:23.050
Finally brought Woodrow Wilson's dream to life.

357
00:20:23.250 --> 00:20:27.130
Wilson's dream had been the imperfect league of nations, but as we all know,

358
00:20:27.131 --> 00:20:30.250
the United nations is still around today with a 90,

359
00:20:30.250 --> 00:20:32.010
44 presidential election rapidly approach.

360
00:20:32.270 --> 00:20:35.880
Roosevelt said he felt torn stating all that is within me,

361
00:20:35.881 --> 00:20:37.960
cries out to go back to my home on the Hudson river,

362
00:20:38.100 --> 00:20:41.680
to avoid public responsibilities and to avoid also the publicity,

363
00:20:41.681 --> 00:20:46.320
which in our democracy follows every step of the nation's chief executive such

364
00:20:46.490 --> 00:20:47.640
would be my choice,

365
00:20:48.200 --> 00:20:52.320
but we have this generation chance to live in a day and an hour when our nation

366
00:20:52.500 --> 00:20:56.520
has been attacked and when its future existence and the future existence of our

367
00:20:56.521 --> 00:21:00.680
chosen method of government are at stake. Roosevelt ran for a fourth term,

368
00:21:00.700 --> 00:21:04.200
but he did not involve himself in the campaign. Still. He won again.

369
00:21:04.460 --> 00:21:09.390
He was now set to serve out 60 years as the president of the United States,

370
00:21:09.970 --> 00:21:10.830
but it wasn't to be

371
00:21:17.010 --> 00:21:20.030
The stresses of the war had taken a heavy toll on Roosevelt.

372
00:21:20.170 --> 00:21:22.630
He was now 62 years old. He looked weary,

373
00:21:22.631 --> 00:21:26.510
suffered from high blood pressure in a weak heart. During the summer of 1944,

374
00:21:26.570 --> 00:21:28.300
he came down with a bad cold.

375
00:21:28.520 --> 00:21:32.020
He was still sick when he traveled by ship in February,

376
00:21:32.020 --> 00:21:35.820
1945 to Malta for the big three conference with Churchland Stalin Roosevelt was

377
00:21:35.890 --> 00:21:39.300
exhausted when he arrived back in Washington on February the 28th people

378
00:21:39.301 --> 00:21:42.740
commented that he looked like he was dying and they weren't far wrong.

379
00:21:49.230 --> 00:21:52.570
All Roosevelt wanted to do now was sleep. At the beginning of April,

380
00:21:52.590 --> 00:21:56.010
he managed to escape Washington for his retreat at warm Springs, Georgia.

381
00:21:56.390 --> 00:21:59.930
On the morning of April the 12th, he sat while an artist painted his portrait.

382
00:22:00.240 --> 00:22:03.170
They stopped for lunch at 1:00 PM. 15 minutes later,

383
00:22:03.230 --> 00:22:07.010
he complains that he had a terrible headache. Then he slumped to the ground.

384
00:22:07.350 --> 00:22:12.120
He was saying a massive cerebral hemorrhage. Franklin Delano Roosevelt.

385
00:22:12.300 --> 00:22:16.640
He died at 3:35 PM on the 12th day of April, 1945.

386
00:22:16.900 --> 00:22:20.280
It was just 27 days before the war in Europe came to an end,

387
00:22:20.460 --> 00:22:24.560
having guided his country through its worst depression and its most harrowing

388
00:22:24.561 --> 00:22:28.040
war. FDR was finally at peace historians.

389
00:22:28.280 --> 00:22:32.430
They can consistently rank Roosevelt George Washington and Abraham Lincoln as

390
00:22:32.450 --> 00:22:36.110
the three greatest presidents, FDR biographer, Jean Edward Smith,

391
00:22:36.270 --> 00:22:37.103
R of Roosevelt.

392
00:22:37.210 --> 00:22:41.070
He lifted himself from a wheelchair to lift the nation from its knees.

393
00:22:41.570 --> 00:22:43.790
So I really hope you found that video inspiring.

394
00:22:43.830 --> 00:22:46.390
