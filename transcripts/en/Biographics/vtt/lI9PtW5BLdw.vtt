00:00:00.210 --> 00:00:03.420
<v 0>If you ask British school children, what happens in the year 10 66,</v>

2
00:00:03.421 --> 00:00:07.860
they will undoubtedly answer the battle of Hastings fought on October the 14th.

3
00:00:07.980 --> 00:00:11.250
They're marked the successful invasion of England's by the Duke of Normandy,

4
00:00:11.520 --> 00:00:13.290
William, the conqueror. But earlier that year,

5
00:00:13.350 --> 00:00:17.250
another pivotal event took place nine months earlier on January the fifth and

6
00:00:17.251 --> 00:00:21.300
elderly King died in the Abbey that he had built Westminster.

7
00:00:21.330 --> 00:00:24.240
His reign had been largely peaceful, stable, and prosperous,

8
00:00:24.241 --> 00:00:25.500
but he passed away without,

9
00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:29.460
as leaving the kingdom in a chaotic mess with four different contenders laying

10
00:00:29.461 --> 00:00:30.690
claim to the throne.

11
00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:35.280
This is the story of that King considered by supporters as a

12
00:00:35.281 --> 00:00:37.380
fair and pious Monarch.

13
00:00:37.560 --> 00:00:42.450
He was slandered by his critics as weak and ineffectual yet also prone to

14
00:00:42.451 --> 00:00:47.040
violence. He went down in history as both a King and a Saint Edward,

15
00:00:47.041 --> 00:00:49.800
the confessor, the last Saxon King of England.

16
00:01:01.790 --> 00:01:02.060
<v 1>[Inaudible].</v>

17
00:01:02.060 --> 00:01:04.490
<v 0>If you know your history, you know that William,</v>

18
00:01:04.491 --> 00:01:07.670
the congruence defeated King Harold Godwinson at Hastings.

19
00:01:07.690 --> 00:01:12.350
So Harold should be considered the last Saxon King, right? Well,

20
00:01:12.380 --> 00:01:16.010
yes, but also know as well learned later,

21
00:01:16.011 --> 00:01:19.850
the legitimacy of Harold's reign was contested from the very start.

22
00:01:20.150 --> 00:01:24.710
And in any case, his Tonya on the throne lasted only 10 months.

23
00:01:24.770 --> 00:01:29.000
So it may be more correct to say that Edward was the last real Saxton King of

24
00:01:29.001 --> 00:01:31.310
England whose legitimacy was not disputed.

25
00:01:31.311 --> 00:01:35.300
And to sat on the throne for a more reasonable amount of time.

26
00:01:35.330 --> 00:01:38.780
The claim of Edward of Saxon King was upheld by none other than Winston

27
00:01:38.781 --> 00:01:41.600
Churchill in his history of the English speaking people.

28
00:01:41.601 --> 00:01:44.930
So Winston thus describes the final moments of Edwards.

29
00:01:44.990 --> 00:01:49.220
The lights of Saxon England were going out and in the gathering darkness,

30
00:01:49.221 --> 00:01:53.810
a gentle gray beard prophet for told the ends when on his

31
00:01:54.290 --> 00:01:56.930
deathbed, Edward spoke of a time of evil that was coming upon.

32
00:01:56.930 --> 00:01:58.400
The land is inspired.

33
00:01:58.401 --> 00:02:02.600
Muttering struck terror into the is thus on January the fifth,

34
00:02:02.601 --> 00:02:03.470
10 66,

35
00:02:03.650 --> 00:02:07.980
and did the line of the Saxon Kings Churchill wrote this passage and he put

36
00:02:08.010 --> 00:02:12.080
1940. When Britain faced these serious threats of a German invasion,

37
00:02:12.140 --> 00:02:16.400
we can therefore understand if he foreshadows the Norman conquest as a time of

38
00:02:16.401 --> 00:02:20.570
evil. We can also forgive this. He overlooked an important fact about Edwards.

39
00:02:20.720 --> 00:02:24.650
The sea was a half Norman by birth and culturally Norman by his upbringing.

40
00:02:24.860 --> 00:02:29.600
This is why we have placed a nice question Mark. In the title of this episode,

41
00:02:29.750 --> 00:02:34.280
the last of the Saxon Kings question, Mark can also be read like this.

42
00:02:34.910 --> 00:02:36.290
The last of the Saxon Kings.

43
00:02:43.040 --> 00:02:43.220
<v 1>Edward.</v>

44
00:02:43.220 --> 00:02:47.540
<v 0>Was born sometime between 10 Oh two and 10 Oh five at S snip in Oxford.</v>

45
00:02:48.050 --> 00:02:52.220
His parents were Emma of Normandy and King Ethel read the second of England's

46
00:02:52.221 --> 00:02:55.550
belonging to the Nobel house of West sex. As the red was Christians.

47
00:02:55.630 --> 00:03:00.430
This is the unreadiness styling that is more accurately interpreted the unwise

48
00:03:00.431 --> 00:03:05.050
or the one without counsel as a King of the red found it difficult to defend his

49
00:03:05.051 --> 00:03:07.870
lands from frequent raids, by Danish Vikings,

50
00:03:08.170 --> 00:03:12.120
a the red trying to keep the deans at Bay by lying himself with the Normans.

51
00:03:12.121 --> 00:03:16.260
He cemented and Alliance by virtue of his marriage to Emma daughter of the Duke

52
00:03:16.261 --> 00:03:19.140
of Normandy. This was ethelred second marriage.

53
00:03:19.170 --> 00:03:22.950
He had already fathered six children from a previous wife of which the eldest

54
00:03:23.340 --> 00:03:25.200
Edmond was the next in line to the throne.

55
00:03:25.470 --> 00:03:29.880
Emma gave two children to the unready Edward and Alfred's an

56
00:03:29.881 --> 00:03:34.080
autobiography of Edward claims that all English novels already hailed him as

57
00:03:34.081 --> 00:03:36.810
their next King while he was still unborn.

58
00:03:37.050 --> 00:03:40.920
The same text mentions that upon his birth, Edward was entrusted by his parents,

59
00:03:40.921 --> 00:03:43.350
do the cat of a monastic order.

60
00:03:43.530 --> 00:03:47.550
This text may have been hagiographic or intentionally aimed to celebrating

61
00:03:47.551 --> 00:03:49.560
Edward as a Saint. Nonetheless,

62
00:03:49.950 --> 00:03:53.790
it sets the tone for two important forces that drove Edward's future life.

63
00:03:53.791 --> 00:03:58.140
His desire to take the throne as a legitimate heir and his deep

64
00:03:58.500 --> 00:04:00.840
religious beliefs, early childhood,

65
00:04:00.841 --> 00:04:02.850
his father struggled to keep England free of Danish. Yeah.

66
00:04:03.180 --> 00:04:07.680
He results to paying what we could define as protection, money to the Danes.

67
00:04:07.710 --> 00:04:11.220
This was ultimately money that HealthRIGHT extracted from his subjects via a

68
00:04:11.250 --> 00:04:15.840
heavy tax known as the Dane gals, the Vikings pocketed the money,

69
00:04:15.841 --> 00:04:18.930
of course, but according to the Anglo Saxon Chronicle,

70
00:04:19.200 --> 00:04:21.780
they went about as they pleased. In other words,

71
00:04:21.781 --> 00:04:25.050
the bribe money hadn't really altered their behavior all that much. It's all.

72
00:04:25.170 --> 00:04:27.480
This was so true that in 10, 13,

73
00:04:27.481 --> 00:04:32.010
Danish King spend fork bid invaded England and laid siege to London

74
00:04:32.490 --> 00:04:35.820
as the reds initially mounted a successful resistance. But yeah, English Nobles,

75
00:04:35.821 --> 00:04:38.850
nevertheless took the occasion to oust him from power.

76
00:04:38.910 --> 00:04:43.320
They had been exasperated by his ineffective rule ends by the burden of the Dane

77
00:04:43.640 --> 00:04:48.540
gals. So why not give to thrown to that Danish bloke as a read

78
00:04:48.630 --> 00:04:50.250
Emma and their two children,

79
00:04:50.251 --> 00:04:53.820
they fled to safety and Normandy where Edward was first exposed to Norman.

80
00:04:53.821 --> 00:04:57.900
Cultural influence spent fork bid was crowned King of England on Christmas day,

81
00:04:57.901 --> 00:05:02.490
10 13, but his reign was short-lived as he died just five weeks later.

82
00:05:02.790 --> 00:05:03.571
That's the red, the unready.

83
00:05:03.571 --> 00:05:07.260
He returns to the throne after he was recalled for Norman D by the West end,

84
00:05:07.261 --> 00:05:11.370
the council of English nobleman at the red center had some ambassadors led to by

85
00:05:11.371 --> 00:05:14.730
his son. Edward, I have been more than 11 or 12 years old,

86
00:05:14.731 --> 00:05:19.260
but he acted as a consummate diplomat reassuring the Nobles that his father

87
00:05:19.261 --> 00:05:23.310
would rule them fairly and tax them against further Danish.

88
00:05:23.310 --> 00:05:26.610
Offensives the unready returns during lens of 10, 14,

89
00:05:26.611 --> 00:05:29.850
and immediately actually per Patta face Knute, the son of spending. Yeah,

90
00:05:30.330 --> 00:05:33.540
very aggressive intentions. The new King of the day,

91
00:05:33.690 --> 00:05:37.020
it was led writing policies into much of Southern England through 10 50 Dean and

92
00:05:37.021 --> 00:05:40.920
10, 16 plums, a ring and slaying with Gusto.

93
00:05:40.980 --> 00:05:45.090
His army had grown stronger. Thanks to Alliance with Edrick powerful, uh,

94
00:05:45.330 --> 00:05:48.390
of Mercia, which is roughly equivalent to today's Midlands.

95
00:05:48.900 --> 00:05:52.800
Although I'll ask the red Lake ill in the town of caution and the marauding

96
00:05:52.801 --> 00:05:56.040
Vikings were opposed by his son, Edmonds nicknames,

97
00:05:56.070 --> 00:05:59.540
the iron site on April the 23rd, 10 sixteens, and George's day,

98
00:05:59.541 --> 00:06:02.630
I thought red died as people shed a few tears. They,

99
00:06:02.660 --> 00:06:04.670
as the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle records, this,

100
00:06:04.940 --> 00:06:08.750
he ended his days having held his kingdom in much tribulation and difficulty,

101
00:06:08.751 --> 00:06:11.150
as long as his life continued,

102
00:06:11.360 --> 00:06:15.800
but were elected Edmund as the King and the Ironside continued the fight.

103
00:06:16.040 --> 00:06:20.000
It appears that his half brother Edward was by his side. At this point,

104
00:06:20.001 --> 00:06:24.680
our protagonist must have been about 14 years old and he had displayed religious

105
00:06:24.740 --> 00:06:26.330
and diplomatic qualities so far,

106
00:06:26.331 --> 00:06:31.220
but that didn't stop the young Prince from proving himself as a beast of a

107
00:06:31.221 --> 00:06:33.650
warrior. According to a Scandinavian source,

108
00:06:33.651 --> 00:06:36.050
during a battle with the Danes for the control of London,

109
00:06:36.230 --> 00:06:39.200
Edward came within striking distance of King Knute.

110
00:06:39.350 --> 00:06:42.590
He then delivered a formidable downward blow with his sword.

111
00:06:42.620 --> 00:06:44.330
One of candidates leftenants thought,

112
00:06:44.510 --> 00:06:46.910
or the tool shoved his King out of harm's way,

113
00:06:46.911 --> 00:06:50.390
but the force of the blow was such that it smoked a Sunder,

114
00:06:50.391 --> 00:06:53.150
the saddle and the horses back, Oh,

115
00:06:53.330 --> 00:06:56.660
for a defeated Ashington in the County of Essex Edmonds agreed to an Alliance

116
00:06:56.661 --> 00:07:00.440
with Knute. Under these terms, the deans would retain control of Mercia.

117
00:07:00.470 --> 00:07:04.220
And as much of the North of England, while abdomen would rule over West six,

118
00:07:04.221 --> 00:07:08.210
which corresponds to Southwestern England's from London to Cornwall in November

119
00:07:08.211 --> 00:07:09.044
of the same year,

120
00:07:09.050 --> 00:07:13.400
Edmund died of natural causes and declared himself King of the whole of England

121
00:07:13.550 --> 00:07:16.520
supported by a large part of the wet end.

122
00:07:22.540 --> 00:07:22.690
<v 2>[Inaudible].</v>

123
00:07:22.690 --> 00:07:25.660
<v 0>To ensure the stability of his throne Kony set of out,</v>

124
00:07:25.690 --> 00:07:27.640
getting rid of his potential rivals. First,

125
00:07:27.700 --> 00:07:31.120
he ordered the killing of Edward younger brother of the late King Edmonds.

126
00:07:31.150 --> 00:07:35.200
Then he exiled the two infant sons of Edmonds to Sweden arranging for them to be

127
00:07:35.201 --> 00:07:37.420
assassinated. Fortunately, this didn't happen,

128
00:07:37.421 --> 00:07:40.480
but the two princes would not return to England for decades.

129
00:07:40.750 --> 00:07:44.410
The same fate could have before an Edward and his brother Alfred.

130
00:07:44.411 --> 00:07:48.430
So they left the country for a second voluntary exile in Normandy.

131
00:07:48.490 --> 00:07:51.250
While there Edward learns that's in July 10, 17,

132
00:07:51.251 --> 00:07:53.140
his mother Emma had married Knute.

133
00:07:53.290 --> 00:07:58.030
This was a blow capable of breaking a horse into had Emma of

134
00:07:58.510 --> 00:08:02.620
Normandy married, a sworn enemy of their own family. The marriage was in fact,

135
00:08:02.650 --> 00:08:06.940
an astute power move aimed at smoothing the transition from the old rule of the

136
00:08:07.570 --> 00:08:09.550
Westech Saxons to the new reign.

137
00:08:09.850 --> 00:08:13.030
Emma was also aware that her own children were too removed from the line of

138
00:08:13.031 --> 00:08:16.450
succession and that she risked deportation or even assassination.

139
00:08:16.451 --> 00:08:19.480
If she did not accept the offer to marry can moot. Lastly,

140
00:08:19.540 --> 00:08:22.870
Emma took the occasions. You soften the otherwise harsh rule of Knute,

141
00:08:22.871 --> 00:08:25.510
especially in the first years of his reign walking,

142
00:08:25.600 --> 00:08:28.780
he traveled extensively back and forth between England and Denmark.

143
00:08:28.810 --> 00:08:31.960
Emma acted as the de facto ruler of the country,

144
00:08:31.961 --> 00:08:35.590
reducing when possible the heavy taxes imposed by her husbands.

145
00:08:35.800 --> 00:08:40.000
She also reimbursed church property out of her own pocket after it was damaged

146
00:08:40.001 --> 00:08:42.850
by the rowdy Danish armies. So all in all,

147
00:08:43.000 --> 00:08:46.600
and the second marriage was less an act of betrayal than a calculated move to

148
00:08:46.601 --> 00:08:49.240
protect herself into her adopted country. However,

149
00:08:49.510 --> 00:08:53.920
distant teenage sons may have not understood this notion at the time Edward

150
00:08:53.921 --> 00:08:55.770
spent his formative in Normandy,

151
00:08:55.771 --> 00:08:59.910
gradually turning to the church and religion for comfort support and advice and

152
00:08:59.911 --> 00:09:01.740
keeping with his origin story.

153
00:09:01.740 --> 00:09:05.850
The Prince develops piety and devotion worthy of a Bishop.

154
00:09:05.880 --> 00:09:09.330
Yet he maintains ambitions worthy of a King.

155
00:09:09.710 --> 00:09:14.270
He vowed that he would return to England one day as its rifle ruler,

156
00:09:14.420 --> 00:09:17.840
but succession was not an easier fab. First of all,

157
00:09:17.930 --> 00:09:20.990
canoes already had a man M ought to take his place.

158
00:09:21.080 --> 00:09:24.560
This was a son Harold Halford conceive from a previous yes,

159
00:09:24.561 --> 00:09:28.910
marriage Edwards ambitions were further frustrated when he learns that Emma runs

160
00:09:28.911 --> 00:09:32.870
Knute its size. Another son, half the canoes. As we say in England,

161
00:09:32.900 --> 00:09:36.800
they had an a and a spare leaving very little chance for Edward to return to the

162
00:09:36.801 --> 00:09:40.010
throne as dreams, Prince Hoff, canoed for succession.

163
00:09:40.100 --> 00:09:43.970
I wonder then that Edward turns to his more distant Norman relatives for

164
00:09:43.971 --> 00:09:46.580
familiar comfort and support port over the years,

165
00:09:46.910 --> 00:09:48.770
Edward cemented his relationship with the Norman.

166
00:09:49.130 --> 00:09:52.940
Aerostar bringing them to his cause that you normally himself. Robert,

167
00:09:52.941 --> 00:09:56.000
the first attempt did an invasion of England in 10 34 with the goal of

168
00:09:56.001 --> 00:09:58.850
attempting to restore Edward do his rightful position.

169
00:09:59.270 --> 00:10:02.630
The expedition was thwarted by unfavorable winds and the whole project was

170
00:10:02.631 --> 00:10:06.170
abandoned when Robert died the following year in November of 10 35,

171
00:10:06.171 --> 00:10:11.000
another funeral took place on the other side of the channel King Knute had

172
00:10:11.001 --> 00:10:12.170
died. His son,

173
00:10:12.760 --> 00:10:17.180
Emma [inaudible] was declared King of Denmark while Harold Halford stood as

174
00:10:17.720 --> 00:10:18.800
regions in England.

175
00:10:18.830 --> 00:10:23.090
Now the fact that King Harold had no reason to show any loyalty to his dad's

176
00:10:23.091 --> 00:10:24.200
second wife, Anna.

177
00:10:24.290 --> 00:10:27.650
He could have gotten rid of her at any moments needed protection.

178
00:10:27.651 --> 00:10:31.670
And it may be for this reason that she invited her two sons back to England from

179
00:10:32.060 --> 00:10:33.170
Norman deep, shortly after that,

180
00:10:33.770 --> 00:10:37.190
Alfred was quickly captured by an opportunistic Godwin of West 60,

181
00:10:37.200 --> 00:10:40.820
wanted to ingratiate himself with half foot Godwin sleeve,

182
00:10:40.850 --> 00:10:43.400
most of Alfred's and then handed them over to Herald.

183
00:10:43.520 --> 00:10:48.290
The Anglo-Saxon Chronicle describes what followed as such a deed. More dreary,

184
00:10:48.830 --> 00:10:53.720
none in this all land was done since Englishman gave place to hoards of Danish

185
00:10:53.721 --> 00:10:57.290
race. Harold's men blinded poor Alfred with red hot pokers,

186
00:10:57.291 --> 00:10:59.510
and then left him to die inside of him on a street.

187
00:10:59.870 --> 00:11:01.970
Edward had to escape back to Normandy once again,

188
00:11:01.971 --> 00:11:05.090
adding Godwin to his list of enemies without support from her sons.

189
00:11:05.091 --> 00:11:08.990
Emma was eventually expelled by Harold and forced to live in Bruge modern day

190
00:11:09.350 --> 00:11:12.350
belts. From there, she wants again, appeal to Edward Bay,

191
00:11:12.650 --> 00:11:16.820
waiting for his help in securing the succession and Hopkins favor.

192
00:11:16.910 --> 00:11:19.460
Understandably Edward refuse to provide anything help.

193
00:11:19.610 --> 00:11:22.190
He was pious and religious and all of that,

194
00:11:22.490 --> 00:11:24.590
but this was taking things just a bit too far.

195
00:11:24.620 --> 00:11:28.190
In any case Emma's wishes came true even without help from Edward.

196
00:11:28.191 --> 00:11:31.220
When Harold half died in 10 40 half,

197
00:11:31.221 --> 00:11:33.620
the canoes was able to take the throne in England.

198
00:11:33.650 --> 00:11:34.670
The following year heart's going.

199
00:11:34.730 --> 00:11:37.640
It was proved to be a more magnanimous Monique than his father.

200
00:11:37.670 --> 00:11:41.720
He did not excellent or assassinate potential threats to the throne. Actually,

201
00:11:41.750 --> 00:11:43.820
he did the opposite upon him, his insistence,

202
00:11:43.821 --> 00:11:47.090
he invited Edward back to England to designated emesis successor.

203
00:11:47.150 --> 00:11:51.530
Suddenly Edward was just a few months away from the goal of a lifetime.

204
00:11:51.830 --> 00:11:52.970
In fact, on June the eighth,

205
00:11:52.990 --> 00:11:57.940
10 42 half can it died in a way befitting of such a turbulent

206
00:11:57.941 --> 00:12:02.470
time. He died by poisoning alcohol poisoning to be exact.

207
00:12:02.590 --> 00:12:05.110
In other words, he totally drank himself to death.

208
00:12:11.910 --> 00:12:13.650
Even with Hoskin it's blessing,

209
00:12:14.040 --> 00:12:18.390
Edward still needed the wet on the council of Nobles to support his Ascension.

210
00:12:18.600 --> 00:12:21.270
This was not a given, but he did enjoy their support.

211
00:12:21.271 --> 00:12:24.780
Thanks to the lobbying of the three most powerful Saxon Earl's Leah for ax

212
00:12:24.781 --> 00:12:28.620
seaward, and a wafer. It Godwin Earl of Wessex. Yeah,

213
00:12:28.650 --> 00:12:32.610
the same guy who played Lackey to Harold Halford and who had caused the gruesome

214
00:12:32.611 --> 00:12:35.520
death of Edward's brother. Alfred, it may sound strange,

215
00:12:35.521 --> 00:12:38.880
but Edward and Godwin did forge an uneasy Alliance born out of political

216
00:12:38.881 --> 00:12:41.640
opportunism. And of course, thanks to the wetlands support.

217
00:12:41.641 --> 00:12:45.510
Edward was crowned King of England on April the third, 10 43.

218
00:12:45.780 --> 00:12:49.560
One of the first recorded actions taken by the new King took place on November

219
00:12:49.561 --> 00:12:50.970
the 16th, 10 43,

220
00:12:51.240 --> 00:12:55.860
Edward supported by Godwin and his retinue paid a surprise visit to his mother,

221
00:12:55.950 --> 00:13:00.060
Emma in Winchester in a Swift action. Edward took revenge,

222
00:13:00.300 --> 00:13:02.910
a bond DM mother, as I explained earlier,

223
00:13:02.940 --> 00:13:06.870
her actions after the death of Ethel red may have been politically justifiable.

224
00:13:06.900 --> 00:13:10.260
Angie had insisted that house candidates invited Edward back to England,

225
00:13:10.320 --> 00:13:13.110
but on a personal level, it is understandable.

226
00:13:13.111 --> 00:13:16.770
If Edward felt very little affection towards his mother became seized.

227
00:13:16.771 --> 00:13:20.580
All of her Lamb's properties and jewels even had her evicted from her official

228
00:13:21.090 --> 00:13:22.350
residence at Winchester castle.

229
00:13:22.560 --> 00:13:26.310
And that I needed some nine years later in virtual poverty and obscurity.

230
00:13:26.370 --> 00:13:27.210
After this incident,

231
00:13:27.600 --> 00:13:31.260
Edward's reign was fairly stable as described by biographer William of

232
00:13:31.261 --> 00:13:35.220
Malmesbury. There was no foreign war, always calm and peaceable,

233
00:13:35.280 --> 00:13:36.480
both at home and abroad.

234
00:13:36.600 --> 00:13:41.340
He conducted himself so mildly that he would not even utter a word of reproach

235
00:13:41.400 --> 00:13:45.060
to the meanest person. Malmesbury clearly appreciated Edward's rule.

236
00:13:45.270 --> 00:13:48.960
As he praised his domestic policies in the exaction of taxes,

237
00:13:49.110 --> 00:13:53.010
he was sparing as the abominate, the insulins of collectors,

238
00:13:53.070 --> 00:13:57.930
this good King abrogated bad laws with his and established good ones

239
00:13:58.020 --> 00:14:01.530
and filled with joy, all that Britain over which she ruled. Nonetheless,

240
00:14:01.531 --> 00:14:04.460
Edward had to deal with internal conflict, the same ELLs who,

241
00:14:04.461 --> 00:14:08.190
which supported his claim soon grew suspicious of Edwards pro and leanings.

242
00:14:08.220 --> 00:14:11.820
These were reflected in his administrative and ruling style. More visibly.

243
00:14:11.910 --> 00:14:14.220
The Norman influence was evidence in the new Abby.

244
00:14:14.221 --> 00:14:15.790
He ordered be built Westminster.

245
00:14:16.170 --> 00:14:19.860
Rabih the first English church in the Norman Romanesque architectural style.

246
00:14:19.920 --> 00:14:24.030
Edward knew that of the Earls of the West and the most powerful was Godwin.

247
00:14:24.090 --> 00:14:27.660
He sold to prevent any conspiracy by becoming a relative of his in January 10

248
00:14:27.661 --> 00:14:31.770
45, Edward married Godwin's daughter, Edith Godwin, may of 12,

249
00:14:31.890 --> 00:14:35.400
his mustache at the thought of becoming grandfather to a future King excepts

250
00:14:35.460 --> 00:14:40.170
Edward constantly torn between political power and religious pursuits made a vow

251
00:14:40.171 --> 00:14:43.740
of chastity. Edwards' demeanor was increasingly pre-sliced.

252
00:14:43.741 --> 00:14:47.730
He was popular among his subjects for his piety and devotion soon,

253
00:14:47.731 --> 00:14:50.250
developing a reputation as a bit of a Holy man,

254
00:14:50.400 --> 00:14:55.220
according to biographers God glorified King Edward with the gift of miracles,

255
00:14:55.280 --> 00:14:59.540
Chronicle or spurts of Claire tells a story of how the King helped a blind man

256
00:14:59.541 --> 00:15:01.610
from Lincoln did recover his sight.

257
00:15:01.850 --> 00:15:05.750
Or how about another anonymous biographer who wrote about a young woman who was

258
00:15:05.751 --> 00:15:08.690
plagued by a nasty infection of the throat in glands,

259
00:15:09.080 --> 00:15:10.580
the disease worse than so much.

260
00:15:10.581 --> 00:15:15.140
So that worms together with pus and blood came out of various holes.

261
00:15:15.200 --> 00:15:19.400
One night the woman had a dream that she would be healed if the King washed her

262
00:15:19.401 --> 00:15:20.120
face,

263
00:15:20.120 --> 00:15:23.900
Edward heard about her and agreed to carry out the treatment hardly had she been

264
00:15:23.930 --> 00:15:26.870
a quarter a week when all found us washed away,

265
00:15:26.990 --> 00:15:29.450
the grace of God molded her with beauty.

266
00:15:29.600 --> 00:15:33.290
The writer specifies that these prodigies left the English in orbit.

267
00:15:33.291 --> 00:15:37.520
Also that Edward had been performing routinely similar miracles as a young man.

268
00:15:37.660 --> 00:15:38.493
<v 1>Normandy.</v>

269
00:15:44.440 --> 00:15:46.840
<v 0>The Normans haven't quite left the story just yet,</v>

270
00:15:46.870 --> 00:15:48.730
which seems like a bit of a recurring theme,

271
00:15:48.840 --> 00:15:51.970
but the life event with the confessor Edward's mother was Norman.

272
00:15:52.030 --> 00:15:55.900
His upbringing was Norman. His most trusted advisors were Norman.

273
00:15:55.990 --> 00:15:57.310
And sometime during his exile,

274
00:15:57.370 --> 00:16:02.080
he had even allegedly designated a Norman air Jean Quilliam in 10 51,

275
00:16:02.081 --> 00:16:03.310
Edward appointed a Norman.

276
00:16:03.311 --> 00:16:08.200
Robert [inaudible] is Archbishop of Canterbury against the direct wishes of his

277
00:16:08.201 --> 00:16:09.310
father-in-law Godwin.

278
00:16:09.400 --> 00:16:13.420
Archbishop Robert was not too keen on Goldwin either as he reported that the air

279
00:16:13.421 --> 00:16:15.220
was plotting to assassinate the King,

280
00:16:15.340 --> 00:16:17.590
the relationship was reaching a bit of a breaking point.

281
00:16:17.620 --> 00:16:19.930
Things went from bad to worse in September.

282
00:16:20.080 --> 00:16:23.410
The town spoke of Dover attacked a retinue of a Norman visitor,

283
00:16:23.411 --> 00:16:25.690
the counts of billowing in retaliation,

284
00:16:25.691 --> 00:16:29.980
the King ordered Godwin's exact punishment on the town. Godwin refused.

285
00:16:30.130 --> 00:16:33.340
He began raising an army with his eldest sons fan and Harold,

286
00:16:33.520 --> 00:16:36.760
the rebel L marched against the King who was taken by surprise.

287
00:16:36.820 --> 00:16:40.450
The English crown could raise a national militia, but it needed time.

288
00:16:40.750 --> 00:16:43.600
Only the most powerful Nobels could rely on standing armies,

289
00:16:43.601 --> 00:16:47.110
which they could mobilize in a short amount of time. In this case,

290
00:16:47.140 --> 00:16:50.800
Edward was saved at the last moment by the C-word exams,

291
00:16:51.010 --> 00:16:55.030
we are afraid that a powerful contingent against God when the kingdom was spared

292
00:16:55.031 --> 00:16:59.050
a civil war though, as both parties, weren't really keen to find reasons well,

293
00:16:59.051 --> 00:17:00.310
who could really blame them.

294
00:17:00.400 --> 00:17:03.310
Edward and Godwin agreed on a different way to settle their disputes.

295
00:17:03.340 --> 00:17:06.970
They would convene a meeting of the wit and in London by the end of 10 51,

296
00:17:07.090 --> 00:17:11.080
at which the Earl of Wessex and his sons would then their grievances against the

297
00:17:11.081 --> 00:17:15.160
King. Edward got wins that Godwin's fan and Harold's were coming to London.

298
00:17:15.490 --> 00:17:15.820
All right.

299
00:17:15.820 --> 00:17:19.840
But they were bringing along their army to the King now had more time to act.

300
00:17:19.960 --> 00:17:24.610
And so he issued an order for the militia to be convened from all English lands.

301
00:17:24.670 --> 00:17:28.570
Most of the nights in Godwin's service were more loyal to the King than do their

302
00:17:28.571 --> 00:17:31.630
role. And so they abandoned the West six forces to join Edwards.

303
00:17:31.840 --> 00:17:35.590
By the time Goldwin arrived in London, his forces had just melted away,

304
00:17:35.710 --> 00:17:39.490
King Edward delivered the next blow by outlawing the Earl and his family.

305
00:17:39.640 --> 00:17:43.120
In a matter of days that all left England perils and another brother had sought

306
00:17:43.121 --> 00:17:46.840
refuge in Ireland, Godwin and his other sons exiled themselves to Flanders.

307
00:17:47.050 --> 00:17:47.830
Next,

308
00:17:47.830 --> 00:17:51.300
Edward confiscated all of Godwin's estates and riches before enacting the final

309
00:17:51.301 --> 00:17:52.740
stages of his revenge play.

310
00:17:52.950 --> 00:17:56.070
You may remember that Godwin was actually the King's father-in-law well,

311
00:17:56.100 --> 00:17:58.560
Edward decided he couldn't trust his own wife Edith.

312
00:17:58.561 --> 00:18:02.730
So he sent her away to a nunnery Edward's advantage against Godwin's family was

313
00:18:02.731 --> 00:18:04.470
short-lived though without the metal.

314
00:18:04.650 --> 00:18:08.070
Some of father-in-laws around Edward took the occasion to invite more Norman

315
00:18:08.640 --> 00:18:11.430
advisors to court. This ill-advised decision irked,

316
00:18:11.431 --> 00:18:15.900
some members of the West who turns their sympathies towards the exiled out of

317
00:18:16.150 --> 00:18:20.040
West six in the summer of 10 52 Goldwind returns to England's landing in cans

318
00:18:20.041 --> 00:18:23.010
with a powerful fleet. At the same time, his son, Harold,

319
00:18:23.011 --> 00:18:25.620
a competent military leader, disembarked in Devin,

320
00:18:25.800 --> 00:18:27.720
the two armies converged near sandwich.

321
00:18:27.721 --> 00:18:30.210
And from there launched an attack towards London.

322
00:18:30.240 --> 00:18:34.260
The Anglo Saxon Chronicle describes how on this occasion Edward's reaction was

323
00:18:34.261 --> 00:18:38.340
slow and indecisive many Southern Lords and Knights that already signed with

324
00:18:38.790 --> 00:18:42.780
Goldwind due to the antinomian sympathies as Godwin's army swelled and March to

325
00:18:42.781 --> 00:18:45.870
London. It plundered, burned and looted without a restraint.

326
00:18:46.080 --> 00:18:48.720
Many landowners went to King Edward to ask for help,

327
00:18:48.750 --> 00:18:51.960
but when he failed to Mount a timely counter attack,

328
00:18:52.140 --> 00:18:56.160
they were all too happy to switch sides. When Godwin and Harold reached London,

329
00:18:56.520 --> 00:18:59.760
Edward's army and fleet were entirely surrounded by their enemies. Once again,

330
00:18:59.761 --> 00:19:03.090
England was on the brink of a large-scale civil war. And once again,

331
00:19:03.270 --> 00:19:04.440
it was averted at the last minute.

332
00:19:04.530 --> 00:19:08.910
It's when officers are in both armies preferred to parlay, rather than a fight,

333
00:19:09.060 --> 00:19:11.910
the truce was followed by another meeting of the West end in London,

334
00:19:11.911 --> 00:19:15.630
which resulted in a humiliating defeat for Edward and the council Godwin and his

335
00:19:15.631 --> 00:19:18.780
sons were cleared of all charges that had been laid against them.

336
00:19:18.810 --> 00:19:20.010
Treason rebellion,

337
00:19:20.130 --> 00:19:24.120
conspiracy to assassinate the King and to even Godwin's role in causing the

338
00:19:24.121 --> 00:19:28.740
death of Alfred Edward pressed by the majority of the Nobles had to comply the

339
00:19:28.920 --> 00:19:32.040
wits and also demanded for Archbishop Robert to be proclaimed and outlawed

340
00:19:32.041 --> 00:19:33.750
alongside other Norman advantages.

341
00:19:33.900 --> 00:19:36.510
Godwin died the following year in quite a dramatic fashion.

342
00:19:36.570 --> 00:19:40.980
Evidently he choked on a piece of breads after swearing to the King.

343
00:19:41.250 --> 00:19:44.400
Let's go to who knows all things be. My judge may this crust of bread,

344
00:19:44.401 --> 00:19:45.960
which I hold in my hands,

345
00:19:46.140 --> 00:19:51.060
pass through my throat and leave me unharmed to show that I was innocent of your

346
00:19:51.061 --> 00:19:54.210
brother's death, just the Shaun and Freud of his death go to it.

347
00:19:54.211 --> 00:19:57.900
And his family had imagined victorious from that deal with Edward moreover,

348
00:19:57.901 --> 00:20:01.080
the Norman influence had been removed from course, if do Quilliam of Norman's.

349
00:20:01.090 --> 00:20:04.860
He wanted to set on the English throne, Hey, I have to earn their right by four

350
00:20:11.990 --> 00:20:15.650
Edward ends it his sixth decade. It became clear that he would die childless.

351
00:20:15.650 --> 00:20:17.720
<v 3>So who would succeed him?</v>

352
00:20:17.840 --> 00:20:21.320
<v 0>We already know that he would have appointed William of Normandy as his heir on</v>

353
00:20:21.321 --> 00:20:24.590
a previous occasion, but this choice was not palatable to the Whitman,

354
00:20:24.860 --> 00:20:28.160
the council of Nobles pressed for another alternative, you know,

355
00:20:28.220 --> 00:20:31.880
the children of Edmond Ironsides Xcel to Sweden. Well,

356
00:20:31.910 --> 00:20:35.840
the eldest who was also called Edward was still alive and kicking and hungry in

357
00:20:35.841 --> 00:20:38.660
10 56, the King decided to have him brought back to England.

358
00:20:38.780 --> 00:20:43.430
He entrusted this difficult task to his old enemy. Harold's son of Godwin.

359
00:20:43.580 --> 00:20:47.150
Now Harold Godwinson after the death of Godwin,

360
00:20:47.800 --> 00:20:51.160
Edward Hood learns to appreciate Harold's qualities. I like his father.

361
00:20:51.220 --> 00:20:54.850
Harold had proven to be loyal to the King and he was also a successful military

362
00:20:54.851 --> 00:20:58.960
leader. He had proven his skill by beating several victorious campaigns against

363
00:20:58.961 --> 00:21:02.890
rebellious Welch lead up Harold succeeded on his mission returning with Prince

364
00:21:02.891 --> 00:21:06.430
Edward in the summer of 10 57. But on August the 31st,

365
00:21:06.431 --> 00:21:10.360
the Prince died of unknown causes. Had he been poisoned by Harold? Well,

366
00:21:10.361 --> 00:21:14.770
according to pro Norman sources. Oh yes. More realistically though.

367
00:21:15.190 --> 00:21:17.650
Probably not. If that was Harold's intention,

368
00:21:17.651 --> 00:21:20.170
why not just kill the Prince during the long journey back from hungry,

369
00:21:20.171 --> 00:21:24.010
it just doesn't make sense. Prince Edward died leaving a young son behind Edgar,

370
00:21:24.280 --> 00:21:26.350
a filling or thrown worthy.

371
00:21:26.440 --> 00:21:29.500
He was considered by part of the wits end as another possible candidate to the

372
00:21:29.501 --> 00:21:31.420
throne. Despite his young age,

373
00:21:31.510 --> 00:21:35.740
a larger faction in the meanwhile started to consider Harold as a more palatable

374
00:21:35.741 --> 00:21:36.574
success.

375
00:21:36.760 --> 00:21:40.870
He was an effective military leader brother-in-law to the King and ruler of the

376
00:21:40.871 --> 00:21:42.760
most powerful of the English Adams.

377
00:21:43.270 --> 00:21:46.210
Harold star continued to rise in the early 10 sixties.

378
00:21:46.570 --> 00:21:48.760
Edward gradually withdrew from government matters,

379
00:21:48.761 --> 00:21:52.180
preferring to dedicate his time to prayer religious studies and the completion

380
00:21:52.181 --> 00:21:53.320
of Westminster Abbey.

381
00:21:53.380 --> 00:21:57.820
The King preferred to dedicate his most serious matters to Harold and other

382
00:21:57.821 --> 00:22:02.440
members of his family in 10 63, Harold's younger brother toast, toasted quelled,

383
00:22:02.441 --> 00:22:04.030
a rebellion in Northumbria,

384
00:22:04.150 --> 00:22:08.200
following which the two brothers crushed once of rural Prince egg in North Wales

385
00:22:08.290 --> 00:22:10.750
ever more dependent on Harold in 10 64,

386
00:22:10.780 --> 00:22:12.940
Edward sent him on a diplomatic mission to Normandy.

387
00:22:12.970 --> 00:22:16.120
During which time he met Duke William.

388
00:22:16.150 --> 00:22:20.770
What happens in the meeting is disputed according to pro Norman salsas,

389
00:22:20.771 --> 00:22:24.670
the aim of Harold's emission was to confirm to William that he was the

390
00:22:24.671 --> 00:22:28.690
designated successor to the English throne. According to Prozacs and accounts,

391
00:22:28.840 --> 00:22:32.560
Harold was there to negotiate and aligns with the Normans and the succession was

392
00:22:32.561 --> 00:22:37.360
not even discussed. The already puzzling situation was made even more confusing,

393
00:22:37.361 --> 00:22:40.300
biking, Edward himself at the end of 10 65,

394
00:22:40.360 --> 00:22:44.290
the King fell ill and there was nothing that could be done as he lay on his

395
00:22:44.291 --> 00:22:46.810
death bed. During the finest calendar week of the new year,

396
00:22:47.020 --> 00:22:51.520
he called for Harold and pledged the crown to him as a reward for his

397
00:22:51.521 --> 00:22:55.000
services or at least rats Harold's Vashon King,

398
00:22:55.001 --> 00:22:56.590
Harold Godwinson rushed to,

399
00:22:56.591 --> 00:22:59.740
to have himself declared King the very same day of Edward's death.

400
00:22:59.980 --> 00:23:01.720
January the fifth, 10 66

401
00:23:08.160 --> 00:23:10.590
Harold's position was a little-bit secure Edgar.

402
00:23:10.591 --> 00:23:12.810
The Aisling may not have been a credible contender,

403
00:23:12.811 --> 00:23:16.770
but William of Normandy was a fearsome rival. If that wasn't enough,

404
00:23:16.890 --> 00:23:20.870
there was a fourth claimant to the throne, Norwegian King, Harold Hardrada.

405
00:23:21.090 --> 00:23:23.370
Now I'm not going to go into details of what happens next.

406
00:23:23.371 --> 00:23:27.210
For those you can set for our biographics video on William, the conqueror,

407
00:23:27.240 --> 00:23:30.210
I will instead consider King Edward's legacy.

408
00:23:30.390 --> 00:23:33.810
His record as a successful leader is criticized by some historians.

409
00:23:33.811 --> 00:23:35.910
His reign was largely peaceful. Sure,

410
00:23:35.911 --> 00:23:38.970
but he could have sped the country much inviting hands.

411
00:23:39.090 --> 00:23:43.020
He acted more decisively when dealing with Godwin has predilection for Norman

412
00:23:43.021 --> 00:23:47.090
customs and his own Norman heritage was perceived positively by Pronamel and

413
00:23:47.091 --> 00:23:47.780
Chronicles.

414
00:23:47.780 --> 00:23:51.800
FRC could be considered the first of the Norman Kings rather than the last of

415
00:23:51.801 --> 00:23:53.180
the Saxons. However,

416
00:23:53.240 --> 00:23:57.620
his unchecked bias towards advisers and bishops from that land eventually caused

417
00:23:57.621 --> 00:24:02.600
discontent amongst SACS and nobleman over time memories of his piety and stories

418
00:24:02.601 --> 00:24:07.070
of his miracles took over his more earthly deeds and 1163,

419
00:24:07.071 --> 00:24:08.690
almost a century after his death.

420
00:24:08.720 --> 00:24:12.530
Edward was formally proclaimed to saints and styled. The confessor.

421
00:24:12.560 --> 00:24:15.590
This title indicates the scene to suffers for his faith,

422
00:24:15.710 --> 00:24:20.180
but is one step short of martyrdom in 1269 Edward's bones were laid in

423
00:24:20.181 --> 00:24:21.770
Westminster, Abbey here's Abbey,

424
00:24:21.800 --> 00:24:26.120
which back then was the most sumptuous shrine in the Western world.

425
00:24:26.270 --> 00:24:30.020
Edward was England's patron Saint until 1348 when he was replaced by Saint

426
00:24:30.050 --> 00:24:33.230
George. His culture remained alive for centuries though.

427
00:24:33.410 --> 00:24:37.640
And sick of pilgrims would sleep by his shrine in the hope of being cured.

428
00:24:37.910 --> 00:24:39.560
So I really hope you found that video. Interesting.
