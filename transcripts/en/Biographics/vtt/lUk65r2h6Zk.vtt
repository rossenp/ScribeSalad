00:00:14.321 --> 00:00:15.640
in a bit, and let's get into it.

7
00:00:21.820 --> 00:00:23.030
Cornelius, Vanderbilt.

8
00:00:23.031 --> 00:00:26.590
Wasn't exactly what you would expect out of one of the richest men in the world.

9
00:00:26.890 --> 00:00:30.990
He was brutish, ill mannered, barely literate and swore like a sailor,

10
00:00:31.010 --> 00:00:35.070
but perhaps it was the same traits that made him the definition of the American

11
00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:38.710
dream with all the good and the bad that that entailed.

12
00:00:39.010 --> 00:00:42.180
He rose up from nothing from the less than nothing. In fact,

13
00:00:42.400 --> 00:00:46.140
his Dutch ancestors came to the new world as indenture servants,

14
00:00:46.240 --> 00:00:48.900
but through hard work and a Kenai towards the future,

15
00:00:49.450 --> 00:00:53.300
Hees a fortune seldom scene. Before at that time, that being said,

16
00:00:53.400 --> 00:00:55.100
he certainly was no saints,

17
00:00:55.170 --> 00:00:58.460
like all the other industrialists and speculators of his time.

18
00:00:58.870 --> 00:01:01.890
Vanderbilt stepped on plenty of toes to make money.

19
00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:06.290
He was ruthless in business and didn't come to be regarded as America's first,

20
00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:08.003
Robert Barron for nothing

21
00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:18.730
Cornelius Vanderbilt was born on may the 27th, 1794 in Staton island,

22
00:01:18.910 --> 00:01:22.720
New York city to Cornelius Vanderbilt, senior and Phoebe hands.

23
00:01:22.980 --> 00:01:27.440
His ancestors had come to north America 150 years before he was born back.

24
00:01:27.441 --> 00:01:31.600
When the territory was still part of a Dutch colony called new Netherlands.

25
00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:32.560
His great,

26
00:01:32.560 --> 00:01:37.520
great greatgrandfather was a man named Jan Sen who immigrated to America as an

27
00:01:37.521 --> 00:01:40.160
indenture servant. By the time Cornelius was born,

28
00:01:40.260 --> 00:01:44.350
his family station had improved to bit, not by very much.

29
00:01:44.610 --> 00:01:47.190
His parents were farmers and to supplement their income.

30
00:01:47.210 --> 00:01:51.390
His father also operated a ferry that transported people and goods across the

31
00:01:51.391 --> 00:01:55.390
New York Harbor young uncle NES had a very strong work ethic ever since he was a

32
00:01:55.391 --> 00:01:58.590
boy. He labeled on the farm from an early age. And when he was 11 years old,

33
00:01:58.591 --> 00:02:00.630
he dropped out of school to work full time.

34
00:02:01.150 --> 00:02:03.460
Although clearly things would work out of him.

35
00:02:03.720 --> 00:02:07.340
His lack of a formal education would haunt Vanderbilt for the rest of his life.

36
00:02:07.570 --> 00:02:08.740
Even in his later years,

37
00:02:08.840 --> 00:02:12.540
he struggled to write English fluently meant he was in the habit of spelling out

38
00:02:12.541 --> 00:02:13.460
words, phonetically.

39
00:02:13.600 --> 00:02:17.300
It was part of the reason why he could never find acceptance within the ranks of

40
00:02:17.301 --> 00:02:21.060
the wealthy elite. And he was always regarded as a Boish outsider.

41
00:02:21.370 --> 00:02:24.850
Cornelius Vanderbilt might be remembered as a railroad tycoon,

42
00:02:24.851 --> 00:02:27.410
but it wasn't trains that made him his first fortune,

43
00:02:27.630 --> 00:02:32.330
but rather ships his road to success started when he began helping his father

44
00:02:32.400 --> 00:02:35.890
with his ferry service. He learned the business and by the time he was 16,

45
00:02:35.891 --> 00:02:38.010
Vanderbilt was ready to branch out on his own.

46
00:02:38.030 --> 00:02:41.050
He borrowed a hundred dollars from his parents to buy his own ship.

47
00:02:41.250 --> 00:02:44.010
A two mastered sailing vessel called Perga in.

48
00:02:44.340 --> 00:02:46.720
He paid them back by splitting the profits with them,

49
00:02:46.770 --> 00:02:48.640
Vanderbilt faced stiff competition,

50
00:02:48.700 --> 00:02:52.480
but his strategy was to undercut everyone else by offering cheap fares for

51
00:02:52.680 --> 00:02:56.000
transport between Staton island and Manhattan. That being said,

52
00:02:56.001 --> 00:03:00.320
he was also an extremely hard worker and he constantly reinvested in his

53
00:03:00.520 --> 00:03:02.200
business by acquiring more ships,

54
00:03:02.370 --> 00:03:06.760
Vanderbilt quickly built up a reputation as a reliable and assiduous ferryman.

55
00:03:06.860 --> 00:03:09.240
In fact, even though he was still just a young man,

56
00:03:09.300 --> 00:03:12.840
he earns the nickname of the Commodor a Mo, which he eagerly,

57
00:03:12.841 --> 00:03:16.160
embraced and used for the rest of his life. Thanks to his good standing.

58
00:03:16.210 --> 00:03:19.550
Vanderbilt earns an important government act in 1812,

59
00:03:19.551 --> 00:03:22.950
when war broke out between the United States and the United Kingdom,

60
00:03:23.290 --> 00:03:27.350
and he was supplying the forts and ferrying soldiers around New York Harbor.

61
00:03:27.740 --> 00:03:32.030
This period of conflict proved quite prosperous for Cornelius Vanderbilt on the

62
00:03:32.150 --> 00:03:35.270
personal fronts in 1813, he also married his first wife,

63
00:03:35.490 --> 00:03:39.380
cousin named Sophia Johnson. They would go on to have 13 children together,

64
00:03:39.860 --> 00:03:42.700
although they did not have a happy marriage by all accounts,

65
00:03:42.701 --> 00:03:45.340
Vanderbilt was not a very caring father or husband.

66
00:03:45.880 --> 00:03:50.180
It had often been rumors that he regularly cheated on Sophia with prostitutes

67
00:03:50.181 --> 00:03:53.500
and even had, uh, committed to an insane asylum. At one time,

68
00:03:53.930 --> 00:03:55.260
even though he was steadily,

69
00:03:55.261 --> 00:03:59.140
amasing a small fortune as he was building up his fleet in 1817,

70
00:03:59.460 --> 00:04:00.970
then Vanderbilt was offered a position.

71
00:04:01.190 --> 00:04:04.930
He couldn't refuse that of Steamboat captain for years,

72
00:04:04.950 --> 00:04:08.810
the Commodor had developed an interest in steam powered ships as he considered

73
00:04:08.811 --> 00:04:12.370
them superior to sailing vessels and the way of the future. Moreover,

74
00:04:12.550 --> 00:04:16.690
the offer came from Thomas Gibbons, the former mayor of Savanna Georgia,

75
00:04:17.170 --> 00:04:21.120
and one of the wealthiest merchants around Vander assumed command of the

76
00:04:21.121 --> 00:04:25.560
Steamboat mouse and started ferrying people between New York and New Jersey

77
00:04:25.650 --> 00:04:29.640
while simultaneously maintaining control of his growing business. However,

78
00:04:29.740 --> 00:04:33.600
he soon discovered that the Steamboat trade in New York was run by a monopoly

79
00:04:33.750 --> 00:04:36.520
granted by the New York state legislature to,

80
00:04:36.840 --> 00:04:41.030
to men Robert Livingston and influential New York politician and to one of the

81
00:04:41.031 --> 00:04:43.150
founding fathers and Robert Fulton,

82
00:04:43.151 --> 00:04:46.910
the man credited with inventing the first commercially viable Steamboat.

83
00:04:46.940 --> 00:04:49.830
They were both dead by 1817, but their,

84
00:04:50.070 --> 00:04:54.710
he still had a vice grip on the monopoly and they had granted a license to run

85
00:04:54.711 --> 00:04:59.350
steamboats on the Hudson river to former New Jersey Senator and governor Aaron

86
00:04:59.480 --> 00:05:00.550
Ogden. This whole thing,

87
00:05:00.950 --> 00:05:05.260
still audited from a personal rivalry between Gibbons and Ogden. At first,

88
00:05:05.400 --> 00:05:09.700
the former tried to bankrupt the latter by undercuting his prices eventually

89
00:05:09.910 --> 00:05:13.620
Ogden sued and the matter went to court where it actually resulted in a very

90
00:05:13.621 --> 00:05:18.100
important landmark ruling in the cases of Gibbons and Ogden from 1824,

91
00:05:18.240 --> 00:05:21.340
the Supreme court concluded that the commerce clause in the cons,

92
00:05:22.130 --> 00:05:23.410
which granted the federal government,

93
00:05:23.411 --> 00:05:28.090
the power to decide how interstate commerce was conducted also extended to

94
00:05:28.091 --> 00:05:29.130
waterway navigation.

95
00:05:29.160 --> 00:05:32.850
Therefore the state of New York had no right to grant a monopoly in the first

96
00:05:32.851 --> 00:05:37.090
place. And the court ruled in favor of Gibbons to support his employer.

97
00:05:37.100 --> 00:05:41.010
Vanderbilt had his own case against Ogden, even hiring Daniel Webster,

98
00:05:41.370 --> 00:05:45.040
that noted state to argue his case before the Supreme court. However,

99
00:05:45.380 --> 00:05:49.320
it was never heard as it was unnecessary after the ruling in the previous case,

100
00:05:49.750 --> 00:05:54.520
even so Vanderbilt deserves no credit as some sort of pioneering tress.

101
00:05:54.940 --> 00:05:58.600
He only fought the monopoly because it worked against him in the future.

102
00:05:58.860 --> 00:06:01.840
He would've no problem using them to his advantage.

103
00:06:08.300 --> 00:06:12.800
In 1826, Thomas Gibbons died believing his business in the hands of his son,

104
00:06:12.801 --> 00:06:14.000
William Cornelius,

105
00:06:14.001 --> 00:06:17.870
Vanderbilt considered the wealthy merchant as son on what a meant to him,

106
00:06:17.930 --> 00:06:20.910
but he didn't like William and he considered him weak.

107
00:06:21.050 --> 00:06:24.790
He stayed on for a few more years until he got his finances in order.

108
00:06:24.930 --> 00:06:29.110
But Vanderbilt left the business in 1828 and broke off on his own. Again,

109
00:06:29.210 --> 00:06:32.510
he even bought his own Steamboat 145 ton,

110
00:06:33.190 --> 00:06:34.790
106 foot side Wheeler called the citizen.

111
00:06:35.140 --> 00:06:38.220
This vessel was quickly followed by others in the next few years.

112
00:06:38.480 --> 00:06:39.780
As we previously mentioned,

113
00:06:40.380 --> 00:06:44.180
Vanil regularly took the profits he made and reinvested back into his business

114
00:06:44.660 --> 00:06:48.380
steadily building a fleet of steamboats and opening new roots for his ferries,

115
00:06:48.410 --> 00:06:53.100
such as the long island sound, Albany Connecticut's and Providence. Of course,

116
00:06:53.420 --> 00:06:56.220
he faced competitions in all the new areas he expanded to,

117
00:06:56.221 --> 00:07:00.930
but these companies found out quickly that it was dangerous to go up against

118
00:07:01.030 --> 00:07:01.863
the Commodor.

119
00:07:02.030 --> 00:07:06.490
He was absolutely ruthless when it came to business because he had a wealth of

120
00:07:06.730 --> 00:07:10.610
resources, his go-to strategy involved undercutting his opponents prices,

121
00:07:10.780 --> 00:07:14.330
oftentimes to the points where they would either go bankrupt or be forced to

122
00:07:14.331 --> 00:07:14.950
sell to him.

123
00:07:14.950 --> 00:07:18.960
In the cases of some companies that also had deep pockets would often pay

124
00:07:18.961 --> 00:07:19.561
Vanderbilt,

125
00:07:19.561 --> 00:07:24.080
large sums of money to leave the area and take his ferries on another route.

126
00:07:24.340 --> 00:07:27.920
One notable example was when the Commodor wanted to put his ships on the Hudson

127
00:07:27.970 --> 00:07:30.360
river, traveling between New York city and Albany.

128
00:07:30.670 --> 00:07:33.920
This route was dominated by a monopoly called the Hudson river Steamboat

129
00:07:33.950 --> 00:07:37.080
association, but Vanderbilt only saw it as a challenge.

130
00:07:37.430 --> 00:07:38.480
This was at a time when I,

131
00:07:38.550 --> 00:07:42.350
Andrew Jackson was running a populist presidential campaign based around the

132
00:07:42.351 --> 00:07:43.050
common man.

133
00:07:43.050 --> 00:07:46.870
He had gained popularity by portraying himself as a man of the people fighting

134
00:07:47.090 --> 00:07:51.230
the corrupt aristocracy. Vanderbilt did the same thing. It wasn't ours.

135
00:07:51.231 --> 00:07:54.790
After all he did come from a working class family and his behavior in demeanor

136
00:07:55.070 --> 00:07:58.390
was certainly more at home in a bar than not a banquet.

137
00:07:58.490 --> 00:07:59.900
He dub his ferry service,

138
00:08:00.040 --> 00:08:03.540
the people's line and offered cheap rates that working men could afford.

139
00:08:03.840 --> 00:08:07.460
Unsurprisingly, this strategy worked rather well. And soon enough,

140
00:08:07.461 --> 00:08:10.660
the Steamboat association offered him a hundred thousand dollars to leave the

141
00:08:10.661 --> 00:08:14.660
Hudson river, plus another $5,000 a year to stay away

142
00:08:21.450 --> 00:08:21.820
For years,

143
00:08:21.820 --> 00:08:26.490
Vanderbilt focused his business mainly in the region between Boston and

144
00:08:26.510 --> 00:08:27.070
New York,

145
00:08:27.070 --> 00:08:31.730
but he organized a major expansion in 1849 prompted by the California

146
00:08:31.880 --> 00:08:34.530
gold rush. He knew that hundreds of thousands,

147
00:08:34.531 --> 00:08:37.130
even millions of people would be traveling that way.

148
00:08:37.320 --> 00:08:41.160
Many of them looking to settle permanently in the organized California

149
00:08:41.560 --> 00:08:41.841
territory,

150
00:08:41.841 --> 00:08:46.520
which at this point was still lobbying stated when California finally became a

151
00:08:46.521 --> 00:08:50.520
state in 1850 demand for transportation between the east and west coast

152
00:08:50.790 --> 00:08:55.000
skyrocketed. And all of a sudden a new multi-million dollar venture was born.

153
00:08:55.260 --> 00:08:56.160
Unsurprisingly,

154
00:08:56.170 --> 00:09:00.680
Vanderbilt wanted a piece of that pie and started sending steamships along this

155
00:09:00.681 --> 00:09:01.600
route. Back then,

156
00:09:01.620 --> 00:09:06.560
the only way to travel from New York to San Francisco by water was to round Cape

157
00:09:06.960 --> 00:09:09.560
horn. The Southern tip of south America. However,

158
00:09:09.750 --> 00:09:12.840
this trip was long and time meant money.

159
00:09:13.020 --> 00:09:17.070
It was still quicker and less dangerous than traveling Overland across the

160
00:09:17.071 --> 00:09:20.910
United States. But Vanderbilt sought out a way to speed up the journey.

161
00:09:21.060 --> 00:09:25.150
Even more. The solution was a canal across Nicaragua.

162
00:09:25.210 --> 00:09:27.070
It would've shaved days off.

163
00:09:27.200 --> 00:09:31.750
Every single trip Vanderbilt even founded the accessory transit company or ATC

164
00:09:32.110 --> 00:09:35.940
whose purpose was to secure transportation across the, from American country.

165
00:09:36.130 --> 00:09:39.260
However, for various political and economic reasons,

166
00:09:39.320 --> 00:09:41.300
the project never went into construction.

167
00:09:41.400 --> 00:09:45.820
And eventually it was established that a canal across Panama would be more

168
00:09:45.821 --> 00:09:49.940
efficient. That being said, the ATC was not a failed venture. Find the opposite.

169
00:09:49.941 --> 00:09:50.774
In fact,

170
00:09:51.180 --> 00:09:54.060
Vanderbilt may not have been able to secure a route that took passengers from

171
00:09:54.061 --> 00:09:56.610
the east coast to the west coast on a single trip,

172
00:09:57.050 --> 00:10:00.490
but he developed a course that was a mix of land and water travel.

173
00:10:00.670 --> 00:10:02.970
His customers would bought a Steamboat in New York,

174
00:10:02.971 --> 00:10:06.210
which would take them to the Eastern coast of Nicaragua. From there,

175
00:10:06.270 --> 00:10:10.090
the goods and passengers were loaded onto smaller vessels capable of going up

176
00:10:10.091 --> 00:10:14.130
the San Juan river and crossing lake Nicaragua. When they reached lands,

177
00:10:14.131 --> 00:10:18.280
they traveled by stage coach to the Western coast where they boarded a different

178
00:10:18.281 --> 00:10:20.160
steamer headed for San Francisco.

179
00:10:20.260 --> 00:10:23.960
It was the fastest and cheapest way of reaching the east coast and it made

180
00:10:23.970 --> 00:10:26.160
Vanderbilt a nice bundle of money,

181
00:10:26.540 --> 00:10:31.000
but he didn't get everything that he had aimed for what the Commodor wanted was

182
00:10:31.080 --> 00:10:34.480
a big fat government contract to also transport mail.

183
00:10:34.660 --> 00:10:38.390
But it went instead to one of his competitive who founded the Pacific male

184
00:10:38.391 --> 00:10:42.270
steamship company and the United States male steamship company, even.

185
00:10:42.470 --> 00:10:44.830
So the Commodor still had an ACE up his sleeve, his,

186
00:10:44.970 --> 00:10:48.910
his opponents used a route across Panama. It was similar but longer.

187
00:10:49.130 --> 00:10:53.430
So Vanderbilt went back to its tried and true method of slashing his prices to

188
00:10:53.431 --> 00:10:58.300
steal all of his competitions clear and tell it worked as gold rush fever

189
00:10:58.301 --> 00:11:01.940
started to die down. The Commodor saw no reason to keep this rude.

190
00:11:02.000 --> 00:11:06.660
So he accepted a large monthly step end from his opponents to close down the

191
00:11:07.080 --> 00:11:07.560
ATC.

192
00:11:07.560 --> 00:11:12.420
Now you might not be building a canal across Panama or indeed NICAR arguer in

193
00:11:12.421 --> 00:11:15.500
order to transport mail, but maybe you've got an idea for a different business.

194
00:11:15.520 --> 00:11:18.730
And that brings me to today's sponsor square space, two simple things.

195
00:11:18.940 --> 00:11:20.210
Maybe you've got that idea.

196
00:11:20.300 --> 00:11:23.370
Maybe it's for a business or a website or a YouTube channel podcast,

197
00:11:23.371 --> 00:11:26.450
something like that. It's kind of knocking around in your mind. And number two,

198
00:11:26.470 --> 00:11:29.770
the only way to figure out if that idea is worth doing is to get it out there to

199
00:11:29.771 --> 00:11:29.990
the world.

200
00:11:29.990 --> 00:11:33.850
And I know that can be daunting because it's scary to go and do new things,

201
00:11:34.030 --> 00:11:38.360
but not knowing how to set up a website is not an excuse because there are no

202
00:11:38.390 --> 00:11:40.000
excuses available with Squarespace.

203
00:11:40.001 --> 00:11:43.280
Squarespace allows you to create a powerful website for whatever you're up to.

204
00:11:43.420 --> 00:11:45.440

207
00:11:53.120 --> 00:11:54.760
but you'll on a website to go along with it.

208
00:11:54.780 --> 00:11:58.520
It all starts on Squarespace with a beautiful template that you can customize

or you can start from scratch or you can easily move over from an existing

211
00:12:03.881 --> 00:12:06.440
domain. Don't start from scratch though. Like I say,

212
00:12:06.441 --> 00:12:09.560
don't make any excuses and just get started with one of those beautiful

213
00:12:09.920 --> 00:12:12.280
templates. And after you've done all of that, after you've got set up,

214
00:12:12.281 --> 00:12:13.990
there's no no updates. There's no patches.

215
00:12:13.991 --> 00:12:16.270
There's no tech nonsense that you have to deal with.

216
00:12:16.340 --> 00:12:19.910
Squarespace also handles all the websitey stuff. Like I say, podcasts,

save to 10% off your first purchase of a website or a domain,

221
00:12:37.040 --> 00:12:38.220
and let's get back to it.

222
00:12:44.620 --> 00:12:47.260
While Vanil was expanding his operations to the west coast.

223
00:12:47.360 --> 00:12:50.780
He also started offering trans-Atlantic journeys to Europe. Again,

224
00:12:50.890 --> 00:12:52.500
this venture proved profitable,

225
00:12:52.560 --> 00:12:57.330
but the Commodor also learns that not even he was infallible as before his

226
00:12:57.430 --> 00:13:00.810
new route had competition, the British QAR steamship line among others.

227
00:13:01.260 --> 00:13:04.650
Vanil tried to squash it like he always did, but he failed.

228
00:13:04.830 --> 00:13:08.210
The British government was keen to see the company succeed against American and

229
00:13:08.211 --> 00:13:08.870
German firms.

230
00:13:08.870 --> 00:13:13.850
So they provided a low in interest loan plus a generous annual subsidy to ensure

231
00:13:13.851 --> 00:13:18.840
that ARD line had the capital to both build top of the line ships and to compete

232
00:13:18.910 --> 00:13:21.040
with Vanderbilt's undercuting tactics.

233
00:13:21.190 --> 00:13:25.920
Another unexpected setback occurred in 1853 when Vanderbilt saw fit

234
00:13:26.060 --> 00:13:28.200
for the first time ever to take a vacation,

235
00:13:28.540 --> 00:13:31.720
he was almost 60 years old and had been working for most of his life.

236
00:13:31.721 --> 00:13:34.120
So the Commodor decided that if he was to go on holiday,

237
00:13:34.690 --> 00:13:35.830
he would do it in style.

238
00:13:35.960 --> 00:13:40.630
Vanderbilt bought a giants luxurious yacht that he dubbed the north star and he

239
00:13:40.631 --> 00:13:44.830
took his whole family on a grand tour of Europe at a total cost of around half a

240
00:13:44.831 --> 00:13:47.630
million dollars while he was vacationing. The Commodor left.

241
00:13:47.631 --> 00:13:50.950
The management of ATC in Nicarag were in the hands of two men,

242
00:13:51.140 --> 00:13:56.140
Charles Morgan and Cornelius Garrison in came another and called William Walker,

243
00:13:56.240 --> 00:13:57.070
who was a filibuster,

244
00:13:57.070 --> 00:14:01.420
which back then meant that he was a sort of insert who would rally troops to

245
00:14:01.421 --> 00:14:02.940
invade parts of Latin America,

246
00:14:03.090 --> 00:14:06.300
take them over by force and set up English speaking colonies.

247
00:14:06.310 --> 00:14:10.660
There were a few filibusters during the 19th century as manifest destiny was

248
00:14:10.860 --> 00:14:11.520
still a big thing,

249
00:14:11.520 --> 00:14:16.170
but Walker was probably the most famous of the all because he actually exceeded

250
00:14:16.540 --> 00:14:17.200
twice.

251
00:14:17.200 --> 00:14:21.930
Well sort of first in 1853 Walker and dozens of his followers invaded Mexico

252
00:14:22.110 --> 00:14:26.050
and actually conquered the Baja California territory by assaulting its capital

253
00:14:26.110 --> 00:14:28.090
of LaPaz and capturing the governor.

254
00:14:28.310 --> 00:14:32.010
He then declared the Republic of lower California sovereign state with him as

255
00:14:32.011 --> 00:14:33.250
presidents. Of course,

256
00:14:33.560 --> 00:14:36.800
this didn't last long as Walker and his men ran out of supplies.

257
00:14:36.801 --> 00:14:38.040
Desertions became frequent.

258
00:14:38.340 --> 00:14:41.560
And he also had to relocate his headquarters several times because the Mexican

259
00:14:41.670 --> 00:14:45.080
army was just a little bit upset with him in the end. He had no choice,

260
00:14:45.100 --> 00:14:47.520
but to cross the border and surrender to an American army,

261
00:14:47.820 --> 00:14:50.400
he was arrested and charged with an illegal war,

262
00:14:50.401 --> 00:14:54.600
but was actually acquitted after giving an impasioned speech that swayed the

263
00:14:54.601 --> 00:14:55.360
jury,

264
00:14:55.360 --> 00:14:59.800
all Walker learns from this experience was that he needed better financing in

265
00:14:59.960 --> 00:15:00.740
1855.

266
00:15:00.740 --> 00:15:04.720
He was ready to try again this time Nicaragua while the Commodor was still on

267
00:15:04.721 --> 00:15:05.640
his extended vacation,

268
00:15:05.700 --> 00:15:09.640
Walker approached Morgan and Garrison and in exchange for their support of his

269
00:15:09.880 --> 00:15:12.230
co. He pro was that once he was the new president,

270
00:15:12.530 --> 00:15:16.790
he would revoke ATCs charter and issue a new one in their name.

271
00:15:16.930 --> 00:15:19.230
And that's exactly what happened in 1856.

272
00:15:19.231 --> 00:15:23.190
William Walker became the new president of the Republic of Nicaragua and a new

273
00:15:23.191 --> 00:15:27.550
transit business owned by Morgan and Garrison had exclusive rights to operate in

274
00:15:27.551 --> 00:15:30.950
the country. Understandably Vanderbilt was furious when he,

275
00:15:31.020 --> 00:15:34.260
he learns about their treachery. According to an apocryphal story,

276
00:15:34.480 --> 00:15:38.100
he wrote them a short and ominous letter where he said, gentlemen,

277
00:15:38.320 --> 00:15:42.660
you have undertaken to cheat me. I won't Sue you for the law is too slow.

278
00:15:43.290 --> 00:15:46.740
I'll ruin you yours, truly Cornelius Vanderbilt.

279
00:15:47.080 --> 00:15:49.020
And that is pretty much what he did.

280
00:15:49.160 --> 00:15:53.250
He set up another trans company that passed through Panama with dirt cheap

281
00:15:53.350 --> 00:15:57.370
prices to steal their customers. He refused to take any passengers to,

282
00:15:57.470 --> 00:16:01.810
or from Nicaragua and convinced the nearby central American countries to not

283
00:16:01.811 --> 00:16:04.650
recognize walkers government back in the United States.

284
00:16:04.710 --> 00:16:07.130
He sued Morgan and Garrison in a legal battle.

285
00:16:07.350 --> 00:16:11.450
The American media dubbed the war of the Commodor and most decisively.

286
00:16:11.510 --> 00:16:16.120
He sent agents into Nicaragua to cause chaos and convinced the locals to

287
00:16:16.210 --> 00:16:19.320
rebel against Walker. It worked and in 1857,

288
00:16:19.460 --> 00:16:21.960
the filibuster surrendered to the us army. Again,

289
00:16:22.150 --> 00:16:25.840
meanwhile Morgan and Garrison's business went bankrupt and Vanderbilt assumed

290
00:16:25.841 --> 00:16:30.040
control over the regions transit system. Again, as far as Walker was concerned,

291
00:16:30.140 --> 00:16:33.550
he, once again was acquitted as many Americans garden him as a hero,

292
00:16:33.810 --> 00:16:37.430
he then went and tried the same thing in hons, but things went day,

293
00:16:37.630 --> 00:16:41.750
little different that time the hon authorities captured him. And in 1860,

294
00:16:41.751 --> 00:16:43.710
they executed him by firing squad.

295
00:16:50.050 --> 00:16:54.460
The 1860s were a troubling time for Cornelius Vanil as they were for most

296
00:16:54.461 --> 00:16:58.500
Americans because of the civil war on a personal level, he suffered losses,

297
00:16:58.600 --> 00:17:00.780
his youngest and favorite son, George Washington,

298
00:17:00.870 --> 00:17:05.180
Vanderbilt died in the war after contracting malaria and ate misogynist.

299
00:17:05.240 --> 00:17:09.340
The Commodor never showed much attention to his daughters and he considered his

300
00:17:09.341 --> 00:17:12.380
other two sons to beat disappointments. One of them Cornelius,

301
00:17:12.420 --> 00:17:16.730
Jeremiah was a gambler who was on bad terms with his father. After the elder,

302
00:17:16.760 --> 00:17:20.130
Cornelius locked him up in a lunatic asylum. The other one, William Henry,

303
00:17:20.350 --> 00:17:23.370
the Commodor simply regarded as weak and good for nothing.

304
00:17:23.460 --> 00:17:27.570
Eventually Vanderbilt changed his tune about William after he took a poor farm

305
00:17:27.630 --> 00:17:32.010
in Staton island and made it profitable since then Vanderbilt integrated his son

306
00:17:32.040 --> 00:17:33.450
more and more into his business.

307
00:17:33.451 --> 00:17:38.400
And even it was William who inherited most of his father's estate in 1868

308
00:17:38.401 --> 00:17:41.080
Vanderbilt's wife, Sophia died after her passing.

309
00:17:41.300 --> 00:17:44.920
The Commodor began visiting mediums, particularly the Clain sisters.

310
00:17:45.180 --> 00:17:46.760
He fell in love with the younger sibling,

311
00:17:47.120 --> 00:17:51.040
Tennessee Clain and according to some sources, even proposed marriage,

312
00:17:51.270 --> 00:17:54.800
this worried his family who were concerned that Vanderbilt might leave his

313
00:17:54.801 --> 00:17:55.760
fortune to a stranger.

314
00:17:56.140 --> 00:18:00.280
So they played cupids and fixed him up with a distant cousin who was four

315
00:18:00.281 --> 00:18:01.400
decades younger than him.

316
00:18:01.470 --> 00:18:05.320
This cousin had an unusual name for a woman as she was called Frank Armstrong.

317
00:18:05.530 --> 00:18:07.120
We're not exactly sure why,

318
00:18:07.140 --> 00:18:11.350
but at least one historian asserts that this was due to a misguided promise from

319
00:18:11.351 --> 00:18:14.710
her parents due close friends to name their first child, Frank,

320
00:18:14.820 --> 00:18:16.590
even if it wasn't boy, anyway,

321
00:18:16.700 --> 00:18:20.510
Cornelius and Frank eloped in Canada in 1869,

322
00:18:20.650 --> 00:18:22.830
as far as the Claplan sisters were concerned,

323
00:18:22.860 --> 00:18:27.150
they soon gave up their spiritualist ways and became noted suffragists with

324
00:18:27.151 --> 00:18:30.780
Vanderbilt's backing they more out into the business world and became the first

325
00:18:31.020 --> 00:18:33.020
women to open a brokerage firm on wall street.

326
00:18:33.080 --> 00:18:36.860
The older sister dropped the Clain from her name and soon became known as

327
00:18:37.140 --> 00:18:37.420
Victoria.

328
00:18:37.420 --> 00:18:41.980
Woodhole the first ever female candidate for the presidency of the United

329
00:18:41.980 --> 00:18:43.340
States. Going back to the civil war,

330
00:18:43.370 --> 00:18:47.740
this period represented a huge shift in Vanderbilt's business practices,

331
00:18:47.960 --> 00:18:50.930
no longer impressed with the K abilities of steamboats.

332
00:18:50.990 --> 00:18:55.490
He now looked to the railroad as the future truth be told the Commodor had shown

333
00:18:55.690 --> 00:18:59.730
interest in trains for decades. It might have invested in them even sooner,

334
00:19:00.030 --> 00:19:03.650
if not for his involvement in one of the first fatal train accidents in American

335
00:19:03.651 --> 00:19:05.770
history, all the way back in 1833,

336
00:19:05.910 --> 00:19:08.610
the Heightstown rail accident occurred in New Jersey.

337
00:19:08.720 --> 00:19:12.360
When a carriage caught fire caused an axle to break and derailed.

338
00:19:12.361 --> 00:19:17.000
The train one person was killed and dozens were injured among them was Cornelius

339
00:19:17.001 --> 00:19:20.960
Vanderbilt who broke his leg in the crash in the decades. Following the event,

340
00:19:20.961 --> 00:19:23.720
the Commodor had only minor dealings with the rail industry.

341
00:19:24.040 --> 00:19:26.240
He occasionally bought shares in new railroads,

342
00:19:26.300 --> 00:19:29.520
but most of his efforts were concentrated in Nicaragua.

343
00:19:29.521 --> 00:19:33.430
Eventually though he could no longer ignore the potential for huge profits

344
00:19:33.431 --> 00:19:37.270
offered by this new mode of transportation starting in the late 1950s,

345
00:19:37.271 --> 00:19:40.190
he began selling off his fleet of ships during the civil war,

346
00:19:40.191 --> 00:19:42.030
even donated his most prized vessel,

347
00:19:42.170 --> 00:19:45.990
the appropriately named Vanderbilt to the union Navy to use against the

348
00:19:45.991 --> 00:19:48.870
Confederates who dominated the seas with the help of that.

349
00:19:48.980 --> 00:19:52.980
Ironclads Vanderbilts even acted as an advisor when it came to all things

350
00:19:53.100 --> 00:19:56.540
maritime, but he refused an official position in Lincoln's cabinet,

351
00:19:56.980 --> 00:19:59.060
as he wanted to avoid politics at any cost.

352
00:19:59.280 --> 00:20:02.380
The Commodor wasn't very interested in building the railroads.

353
00:20:02.400 --> 00:20:06.100
He preferred to buy ones that already existed in the former monopoly.

354
00:20:06.120 --> 00:20:09.620
His first major purchase was the New York and Harlem railroad. At the time,

355
00:20:09.621 --> 00:20:13.490
it wasn't considered particularly valuable there's it only ran trains for part

356
00:20:13.491 --> 00:20:16.410
of the journey before connecting to horse drawn carriages. However,

357
00:20:16.670 --> 00:20:20.730
it had prime position as the only railway that entered downtown Manhattan,

358
00:20:20.980 --> 00:20:22.490
Vanderbilt brought in hiss son,

359
00:20:22.491 --> 00:20:26.530
William as vice president of the Harlem line and together they soon made it

360
00:20:26.531 --> 00:20:27.080
profitable.

361
00:20:27.080 --> 00:20:31.170
Next up he took control of the Hudson river railroad in 1864 in the New York

362
00:20:31.171 --> 00:20:33.160
central railroad in 80 67,

363
00:20:33.460 --> 00:20:38.120
he also bought smaller adjacent lines to consolidate them all into one giant

364
00:20:38.520 --> 00:20:39.353
railroad empire.

365
00:20:39.370 --> 00:20:43.120
Vanderbilt was already 70 years old when he decided to get into railroads,

366
00:20:43.260 --> 00:20:47.240
he took a backseat role and mostly delegated orders to William and other

367
00:20:47.241 --> 00:20:48.074
subordinates.

368
00:20:48.120 --> 00:20:51.560
Although he did enjoy taking inspection trips to overseers domains,

369
00:20:51.700 --> 00:20:56.080
it seemed that his ruthlessness had subsided somewhat with age, very rarely,

370
00:20:56.440 --> 00:21:00.120
whether any through tactics to get his way more often than nor Vanderbilt

371
00:21:00.121 --> 00:21:03.400
preferred, simply to buy enough stock in a railroad until he became the majority

372
00:21:03.401 --> 00:21:05.720
shareholder and then appoint himself as president.

373
00:21:06.240 --> 00:21:07.670
He even dabbled in philanthropy,

374
00:21:07.671 --> 00:21:11.590
donating a million dollars to establish the Vanderbilt university in Nashville,

375
00:21:11.830 --> 00:21:16.670
Tennessee. The last major addition to the Vanderbilt empire occurred in 1876,

376
00:21:16.671 --> 00:21:20.070
when the TA acquired the Canada Southern railway. Soon after that,

377
00:21:20.071 --> 00:21:23.350
the 82 year old Commodor felt gravely his death.

378
00:21:23.610 --> 00:21:28.580
It was slow and painful being bedridden for before passing away on

379
00:21:28.581 --> 00:21:30.580
January the fourth, 1877,

380
00:21:30.800 --> 00:21:35.380
he remains a cantankerous grumpy mal content until the very end on his better

381
00:21:35.410 --> 00:21:39.020
days, he would curse out his physicians and throw water bottles at them.

382
00:21:39.320 --> 00:21:40.153
On one occasion,

383
00:21:40.240 --> 00:21:43.860
he had to be physically restrained after trying to attack the media men who were

384
00:21:43.861 --> 00:21:48.410
keeping watch outside of his house to report on his death de build's death was

385
00:21:48.411 --> 00:21:50.970
followed by a long, messy lawsuit over his assets,

386
00:21:51.430 --> 00:21:55.490
not wanting to split up his fortune. He left around 90 million of his a hundred,

387
00:21:55.560 --> 00:21:57.250
5 million estate to his son,

388
00:21:57.251 --> 00:22:00.930
William while Frank and the rest of his children received much smaller amounts

389
00:22:00.931 --> 00:22:05.090
in cash or stock ands in case he were wondering that fortune means well over

390
00:22:05.350 --> 00:22:10.200
200 billion in model currency. So I really hope you found that video.
