00:00:05.480 --> 00:00:07.360
learning lessons, more on them in a bit.

4
00:00:13.540 --> 00:00:14.373
In the modern age,

5
00:00:14.550 --> 00:00:18.000
it's given that anyone in the white house will at least briefly get dubbed worse

6
00:00:18.001 --> 00:00:19.520
president ever. Harry Truman,

7
00:00:20.080 --> 00:00:22.950
Ronald Reagan for of both spent part of their administrations with approval

8
00:00:22.951 --> 00:00:23.870
ratings under water.

9
00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:27.670
Heck some of you are probably already hitting the comments to dump on Trump or

10
00:00:27.671 --> 00:00:29.230
declare let's go Brandon.

11
00:00:29.570 --> 00:00:32.470
<v 1>But what happens when the assessment is true?</v>

12
00:00:32.660 --> 00:00:36.390
What happens when the historical consensus broadly agrees that someone really

13
00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:37.950
was the worst? Well,

14
00:00:38.380 --> 00:00:41.620
look at no further than James Buchanan elected in 80 E 56,

15
00:00:41.621 --> 00:00:44.940
Buchana became the 15th president just as the nation was falling apart.

16
00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:48.700
Pro and anti-slavery settlers were massacring one another in Kansas.

17
00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:52.900
John Brown was trying to spark an insurrection and a member of Congress had

18
00:00:52.901 --> 00:00:55.500
nearly murdered another on the Senate floor. Yet,

19
00:00:55.501 --> 00:01:00.500
while this would've tested any president Buchana failed that test spectacularly

20
00:01:00.520 --> 00:01:01.353
in an age of,

21
00:01:01.830 --> 00:01:05.850
he tentatively tried to find a compromise only to watch as both his reputation

22
00:01:05.870 --> 00:01:08.570
and his country plunged into the Abys.

23
00:01:08.710 --> 00:01:12.290
Was he a truly bad leader or just unlucky? Well,

24
00:01:12.300 --> 00:01:16.130
today we are telling the story of the man who history has declared

25
00:01:16.760 --> 00:01:18.530
America's worst ever leader.

26
00:01:23.980 --> 00:01:24.960
<v 0>So far this century,</v>

27
00:01:24.961 --> 00:01:28.640
there have been 14 major surveys of historians and academics that attempted to

28
00:01:28.641 --> 00:01:32.360
rank us presidents from best to worst in or, but four of them,

29
00:01:32.361 --> 00:01:35.800
James Yana finished last on the rare occasions when he didn't,

30
00:01:35.801 --> 00:01:40.160
he placed second from the bottom with such a stinker of a historical reputation.

31
00:01:40.161 --> 00:01:43.470
It could be tempting to think that there must have been something P preordained

32
00:01:43.471 --> 00:01:44.790
about Buchanan's failure.

33
00:01:45.190 --> 00:01:48.630
That it must have been clear how useless he was from the day he was born.

34
00:01:48.770 --> 00:01:52.590
But perhaps that's the most interesting thing about the life of James Buchanan.

35
00:01:52.610 --> 00:01:54.790
If you only focus on it prior to 1856,

36
00:01:54.791 --> 00:01:57.710
you might think that it'd make a pretty good leader born on April the 23rd,

37
00:01:57.990 --> 00:01:59.630
1791 in rural Pennsylvania.

38
00:01:59.810 --> 00:02:03.860
The future 15th presidents came from decent hard working stock.

39
00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:07.980
His father had immigrated to the us from Ireland just eight years earlier and

40
00:02:08.120 --> 00:02:10.180
had already established a successful business.

41
00:02:10.240 --> 00:02:13.220
The boy's mother too was smart and motivated from a young age.

42
00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:15.580
She instilled in Buchanan and his 10 siblings,

43
00:02:15.620 --> 00:02:18.860
a love of breed combined with the best education his father could buy.

44
00:02:18.861 --> 00:02:20.820
These values meant Buchanan graduated,

45
00:02:21.420 --> 00:02:25.450
prepared for a life among his elite. He settled in Lancaster,

46
00:02:25.451 --> 00:02:28.850
studied law past the bar. And by 1812 had opened his own practice,

47
00:02:29.110 --> 00:02:34.050
but his legal career would be put on holes because 1812 was also the year that

48
00:02:34.051 --> 00:02:36.210
north America exploded. The war of 18.

49
00:02:36.211 --> 00:02:39.370
12 is one of those awkward conflicts where a whole bunch of people died,

50
00:02:39.550 --> 00:02:43.570
but nobody really won pitting the Americans and then native allies against the

51
00:02:43.571 --> 00:02:46.280
British their indigenous associates it's saw.

52
00:02:46.281 --> 00:02:49.360
Most of the Northern states threatens in places like Pennsylvania,

53
00:02:49.490 --> 00:02:51.320
milit were activated, enable bodied.

54
00:02:51.321 --> 00:02:54.120
Men were called up among them was James Buchanan.

55
00:02:54.480 --> 00:02:56.760
Although mobilized Buchanan's unit wouldn't see action,

56
00:02:56.980 --> 00:03:00.760
but the big stir around the war itself helped crystallize the young man's

57
00:03:00.761 --> 00:03:03.040
politics. Unlike most of his contemporaries,

58
00:03:03.100 --> 00:03:06.360
he found himself drawn to the anti-war Federalists.

59
00:03:06.510 --> 00:03:08.360
Once America's premier political party,

60
00:03:08.420 --> 00:03:12.280
the Federalists had controlled the government from 1789 to 80 0 1.

61
00:03:12.420 --> 00:03:17.240
By the time the DM Buchanan joins their ranks though the party was in its death

62
00:03:17.600 --> 00:03:17.620
rows,

63
00:03:17.620 --> 00:03:22.070
unable to beat democratic Republicans and hemorrhaging support for its anti-war

64
00:03:22.200 --> 00:03:27.150
views. Still something about their basic conservatism appealed to Buchanan from

65
00:03:27.350 --> 00:03:28.750
1814 to 1819,

66
00:03:28.970 --> 00:03:33.270
he sat as a Federalist in the Pennsylvania house of representatives honing his

67
00:03:33.271 --> 00:03:34.870
political skills. At the same time,

68
00:03:34.970 --> 00:03:38.670
his growing law career helped boost his speaking talent as well as netting him

69
00:03:39.820 --> 00:03:41.900
Ackles of money. By the time he left the state house,

70
00:03:41.901 --> 00:03:44.060
then Buchanan was a growing political force,

71
00:03:44.380 --> 00:03:47.420
a man with a bright and shiny future ahead of him.

72
00:03:47.680 --> 00:03:52.660
Now he just needed someone to share that future with on paper and Carolyn Corman

73
00:03:52.661 --> 00:03:54.860
was the perfect match for the up and coming lawyer,

74
00:03:54.960 --> 00:03:57.980
the daughter of a rich merchants and part of Pennsylvania high society.

75
00:03:58.160 --> 00:03:59.890
She was just the sort of potential wife,

76
00:03:59.891 --> 00:04:02.770
an ambitious young man needed by his sight. Sadly,

77
00:04:02.771 --> 00:04:06.690
that sort of box sticking may have been all Buchanan ever saw in her.

78
00:04:06.691 --> 00:04:10.090
There are two versions of what happens after their engagement.

79
00:04:10.270 --> 00:04:14.130
One version has it that Coleman's parents suspecting Buchanan was after their

80
00:04:14.131 --> 00:04:15.930
money refused to allow the marriage.

81
00:04:16.190 --> 00:04:19.610
The other is that Coleman discovered her fiance was secretly seeing other women,

82
00:04:20.360 --> 00:04:21.193
whatever tale is true,

83
00:04:21.420 --> 00:04:25.400
the outcome was the same Coleman broke off the engagement. And a few days later,

84
00:04:25.780 --> 00:04:28.160
she was dead amid rumors of suicide.

85
00:04:28.300 --> 00:04:32.360
The death of his fiance broke Buchanan forbidden by her family from attending

86
00:04:32.361 --> 00:04:34.680
the funeral. He instead lost himself in politics.

87
00:04:34.681 --> 00:04:39.120
Much later he would claim he began as a national career as a distraction from my

88
00:04:39.320 --> 00:04:39.820
great grief.

89
00:04:39.820 --> 00:04:44.310
It was a decision that would have repercussions for the entire nation.

90
00:04:49.870 --> 00:04:53.550
Although it was as a Federalist that Buchanan won his first seating Congress.

91
00:04:53.850 --> 00:04:56.910
It was clear by then that the party was over in the 1820 election.

92
00:04:56.911 --> 00:05:00.790
They hadn't even been able to find a candidate unless Buchanan wanted to fade

93
00:05:01.300 --> 00:05:01.760
wisdom.

94
00:05:01.760 --> 00:05:06.500
He needed to jump ship like now luckily a new movement was about to throw

95
00:05:06.501 --> 00:05:10.020
Washington's disaffected Politico, a lifeline in 1823,

96
00:05:10.021 --> 00:05:12.900
the state of Tennessee sent the hugely popular war hero.

97
00:05:12.901 --> 00:05:14.500
Andrew Jackson to the Senate,

98
00:05:14.940 --> 00:05:18.580
although nominally a democratic Republican Jackson was really a force unto

99
00:05:18.581 --> 00:05:23.090
himself. No sooner had he hit DC than he began weaving through like a hurricane

100
00:05:23.420 --> 00:05:25.450
scattering old certainties in his past,

101
00:05:25.700 --> 00:05:30.010
among those swept up by his populous movement was James Buchanan like fellow

102
00:05:30.011 --> 00:05:34.410
future president James KPO Buchanan seemed to sense the future in Jackson.

103
00:05:34.590 --> 00:05:37.290
He became old Hary staunchest champion in Pennsylvania.

104
00:05:37.690 --> 00:05:41.170
When four candidates separately ran under the democratic Republican banner in

105
00:05:41.290 --> 00:05:45.480
1824, it was Jackson that he threw his support behind, but 1824,

106
00:05:45.481 --> 00:05:47.360
wouldn't be Jackson's breakthrough year.

107
00:05:47.640 --> 00:05:51.040
Although he netted a plurality of the vote tary didn't went outright.

108
00:05:51.070 --> 00:05:54.920
This allowed the election to be decided in the house where enough delegates

109
00:05:54.921 --> 00:05:56.560
lined up to hand John Quincy Adams,

110
00:05:56.561 --> 00:05:58.720
the presidency to say Andrew Jackson was livid.

111
00:05:59.040 --> 00:06:02.360
It's a bit like saying con McGregor has a bit of an anger management problem.

112
00:06:02.361 --> 00:06:06.360
Jackson cried the corrupt bargain that made Adams president.

113
00:06:06.420 --> 00:06:10.480
He also cried the Buchanan who he felt had failed to back him since Jackson was

114
00:06:10.481 --> 00:06:11.520
an epic grudge,

115
00:06:11.640 --> 00:06:16.400
should this light would help keep Buchana out of serious politics for years

116
00:06:16.750 --> 00:06:21.310
is still Buchanan was by now deeply invested in Jackson's movement.

117
00:06:21.311 --> 00:06:25.670
When Ary reforms, the democratic party Buchanan was still there in Pennsylvania.

118
00:06:26.110 --> 00:06:27.070
Campaigning hard for it.

119
00:06:27.140 --> 00:06:31.950
When Jackson won the presidency in both 1828 and 1832 Buchanan was among

120
00:06:31.951 --> 00:06:33.270
those cheering, the loudest,

121
00:06:33.271 --> 00:06:38.060
eventually his loyalty cooled all Aries temper enough to forgive 1832

122
00:06:38.300 --> 00:06:40.980
Jackson made Buchanan Envoy to Russia. When the lawyer returns,

123
00:06:41.240 --> 00:06:42.980
it was to sit in the senates, a Democrat.

124
00:06:43.120 --> 00:06:47.460
And so he began an 11 year stretch in Congress with Buchanan quietly.

125
00:06:47.461 --> 00:06:48.460
Amasing more power.

126
00:06:48.520 --> 00:06:51.820
It was also the beginning of perhaps the most important relationship in his

127
00:06:51.821 --> 00:06:53.900
life. If you've Googled James Buchana,

128
00:06:54.040 --> 00:06:58.170
you may have come across the claim that he was America's first gay presidents.

129
00:06:58.171 --> 00:07:01.530
This is entirely thanks to his incredibly close relationship with Senator

130
00:07:01.531 --> 00:07:06.290
William Rufus Deva king of Alabama on arriving in Washington, Buchanan and king,

131
00:07:06.291 --> 00:07:08.490
both moved into the same boarding house of bachelors,

132
00:07:08.500 --> 00:07:11.090
originally home to several unmarried congressmen.

133
00:07:11.091 --> 00:07:15.250
It eventually emptied out until only the two remained living like a couple.

134
00:07:15.280 --> 00:07:16.890
This isn't just our modern take.

135
00:07:17.530 --> 00:07:22.000
Deborah's referred to the them as Mr. Buchanan and his wife or aunt Nancy and

136
00:07:22.001 --> 00:07:25.000
aunt fancy. Certainly they made a striking pair,

137
00:07:25.100 --> 00:07:29.880
the reserved fer Colonel king and the outgoing ruckus Buchanan rarely

138
00:07:30.160 --> 00:07:32.520
apart. They clearly enjoyed one another's company immensely,

139
00:07:32.580 --> 00:07:35.960
but while it's tempting to claim Buchanan as an early L G B T pioneer,

140
00:07:36.460 --> 00:07:40.110
the truth is that we simply don't have enough air evidence to say if he and king

141
00:07:40.111 --> 00:07:42.590
were lovers or just really good pals,

142
00:07:42.780 --> 00:07:46.830
certainly there are illusions such as a letter Buchanan send king while he was

143
00:07:46.831 --> 00:07:47.664
away writing.

144
00:07:47.710 --> 00:07:51.110
I am now solitary and alone having no companion in the house with me.

145
00:07:51.310 --> 00:07:53.550
I have gone Aw, wing to several gentlemen,

146
00:07:53.690 --> 00:07:58.350
but have not succeeded with one of them still illusions aren't definitive proof.

147
00:07:58.351 --> 00:08:00.260
And it's all almost beside the point,

148
00:08:00.261 --> 00:08:04.380
whether they were sexual partners or not king had a profound impact on

149
00:08:04.381 --> 00:08:07.420
Buchanan's life. A powerful supporter of states' rights, slavery,

150
00:08:07.560 --> 00:08:12.140
and the supremacy of the white man king was nonetheless notable for being just

151
00:08:12.200 --> 00:08:13.780
as strongly against thees.

152
00:08:13.810 --> 00:08:18.180
This put him at odds with many other southerners and to Beana seemed to point to

153
00:08:18.181 --> 00:08:22.570
an optimistic truth that finding common grounds between free and slave states

154
00:08:22.590 --> 00:08:26.170
was as possible as it was desirable. Sadly for Buchanan,

155
00:08:26.240 --> 00:08:30.130
he'd lived to see just how hollow that truth turned out to be.

156
00:08:30.350 --> 00:08:32.490
And just before we get into the rest of today's video,

157
00:08:32.730 --> 00:08:34.930
I want to tell you about today's fantastic sponsor. Brilliant,

158
00:08:34.931 --> 00:08:39.210
brilliant is a problem solving based website and app with our hands on approach.

159
00:08:39.430 --> 00:08:40.320
Now you've heard meet,

160
00:08:40.321 --> 00:08:42.720
talk about brilliant before they teach you all about math,

161
00:08:42.721 --> 00:08:43.800
science and computer science.

162
00:08:43.801 --> 00:08:46.840
Whether you are a student looking to get ahead or a professional keen on

163
00:08:47.040 --> 00:08:49.720
building some skills, you should absolutely check out brilliant.

164
00:08:49.770 --> 00:08:52.840
Maybe you've always wanted to learn about neural networks,

165
00:08:52.841 --> 00:08:56.440
essentially how computers could program themselves. Well, brilliant.

166
00:08:56.470 --> 00:09:00.080
Have a course on that. And it teaches you through easy to access puzzles,

167
00:09:00.260 --> 00:09:01.720
and it does it in plain English.

168
00:09:01.721 --> 00:09:06.120

178
00:09:40.360 --> 00:09:44.740
By the time 1844 Dawn's Buchanan was an experienced Senator with a significant

179
00:09:44.790 --> 00:09:46.420
power base in the democratic party,

180
00:09:46.730 --> 00:09:50.260
just as the Democrats were getting ready to regain the white house after two

181
00:09:50.261 --> 00:09:51.820
terms of Jackson and one of his success,

182
00:09:51.840 --> 00:09:55.890
Martin van Buren Buchanan's party had lost power to wig it

183
00:09:55.891 --> 00:09:57.170
William Henry Harrison,

184
00:09:57.510 --> 00:10:00.570
but then Harrison had gone and died into his replacement. John Tyler.

185
00:10:01.150 --> 00:10:04.050
So alienated everyone that the white house was back in play.

186
00:10:04.150 --> 00:10:08.290
If the cannon CIN party's nomination, he might well become presidents.

187
00:10:08.291 --> 00:10:10.570
Unfortunately, that was a big if with the crowded field,

188
00:10:10.830 --> 00:10:13.610
the convention deadlocked in need of a compromised candidate,

189
00:10:13.611 --> 00:10:15.610
James K PO's name was pushed forward.

190
00:10:16.440 --> 00:10:19.760
His chance had been blown Buchanan through his delegates behind Polk Polk became

191
00:10:19.761 --> 00:10:22.440
the democratic nominee. And as Buchanan had divined,

192
00:10:22.920 --> 00:10:24.080
he went on to win the white house.

193
00:10:24.370 --> 00:10:28.760
Still PO's Ascension wasn't all bad for Buchanan grateful for his support and

194
00:10:28.761 --> 00:10:31.640
needing to keep Pennsylvania on side for a coming political battle.

195
00:10:31.670 --> 00:10:35.000
Over tariffs Polk made Buchanan his secretary of state.

196
00:10:35.070 --> 00:10:39.030
This dropped old buck right into the middle of the two biggest issues of the

197
00:10:39.031 --> 00:10:40.870
day, Oregon and Texas,

198
00:10:41.390 --> 00:10:45.710
a believer in America's manifest destiny to stretch from sea to shining sea.

199
00:10:45.990 --> 00:10:49.430
Paul could come to power promising to annex the Republic of Texas and kick the

200
00:10:49.431 --> 00:10:51.870
British out of the jointly controlled Oregon territory.

201
00:10:52.030 --> 00:10:55.590
It was demanding prospect for any secretary of state and the wave you can and

202
00:10:55.750 --> 00:10:59.580
dealt with it. Hints at all. His few failings as Polk recorded in his diary,

203
00:10:59.880 --> 00:11:03.140
his new minister was incapable of taking a position which might make his

204
00:11:03.141 --> 00:11:07.180
supporters unhappy. For example, PO's campaign slogan of 45,

205
00:11:07.180 --> 00:11:10.740
40 or fight had implied war with Britain. If it didn't surrender Oregon,

206
00:11:11.000 --> 00:11:13.980
all the way up to the Alaskan border in private Buchanan council,

207
00:11:13.981 --> 00:11:17.340
avoiding conflict and advocated to compromise that eventually became the modern

208
00:11:17.810 --> 00:11:20.890
Canadian us border. But when the compromise bill came to a Senate vote,

209
00:11:20.891 --> 00:11:25.330
Buchanan suddenly transformed into an ardent expansionist excoriating Polk for

210
00:11:25.550 --> 00:11:28.530
not throwing the British out on their tea, drinking asses,

211
00:11:28.640 --> 00:11:33.090
same deal with the Mexican American war triggered by somewhat roundabout route

212
00:11:33.150 --> 00:11:35.050
by the us annexation of Texas.

213
00:11:35.230 --> 00:11:40.120
The war saw America sees huge swath its Southern neighbor Buchanan initially

214
00:11:40.170 --> 00:11:44.360
urged Polk to announce that us would return the conquer territory at the war's

215
00:11:44.361 --> 00:11:47.160
ends that any seizures would only be temporary.

216
00:11:47.220 --> 00:11:51.120
But then the us marched on Mexico's capital and Buchanan suddenly joined

217
00:11:51.121 --> 00:11:53.920
democratic cheerleaders, demanding poll due to Mexico.

218
00:11:54.350 --> 00:11:59.200
What a hungry Yorkshireman does to a pork pipe as far as Polk was concerned.

219
00:11:59.260 --> 00:12:03.760
All of this flip flopping was a sign that his secretary of state was a slim ETO,

220
00:12:03.790 --> 00:12:07.760
more interested in building support for a future presidential bid than helping

221
00:12:07.820 --> 00:12:11.240
to run the country. But a more charitable reading is possible.

222
00:12:11.460 --> 00:12:15.270
All his life Yana was a man who liked to be liked whether it was in the Senate

223
00:12:15.410 --> 00:12:19.150
or as a northerner dealing with southerners or as a bridge between the free and

224
00:12:19.151 --> 00:12:19.840
slave states.

225
00:12:19.840 --> 00:12:23.710
Buchanan's default instinct was to keep everyone happy in better times,

226
00:12:23.711 --> 00:12:26.430
this kind of reflexive centrism could have been his making.

227
00:12:26.860 --> 00:12:30.110
Instead it wounds up being his undoing in 1848,

228
00:12:30.790 --> 00:12:32.390
James Polk stepped down after a single term.

229
00:12:33.020 --> 00:12:36.460
The democratic nomination open Buchanan threw his heart into the ring.

230
00:12:36.461 --> 00:12:39.020
Only for the delegates to figuratively. Take a dump in his,

231
00:12:39.160 --> 00:12:40.540
he placed third on the ballot.

232
00:12:40.860 --> 00:12:42.940
His shenanigans clearly having failed to win him many friends,

233
00:12:43.560 --> 00:12:46.780
not that it mattered. 1848 saw Mexican American war heroes.

234
00:12:47.340 --> 00:12:49.100
Zachary Taylor stand for the wigs netting, the party,

235
00:12:49.220 --> 00:12:50.780
a solid win in the aftermath.

236
00:12:50.781 --> 00:12:53.340
Buchana went back to Pennsylvania to plot his return.

237
00:12:53.670 --> 00:12:57.130
His goal was to come back in 1852 and finally NAB the presidency.

238
00:12:57.131 --> 00:13:00.970
Instead fate would force him to wait until the white house had gone from being a

239
00:13:00.980 --> 00:13:05.050
prize to a cha lace with the bitterest cide

240
00:13:10.270 --> 00:13:12.130
For a guy who liked to be liked.

241
00:13:12.131 --> 00:13:15.560
James Buchana tried a knack for making enemy east, take Stephen A. Douglas,

242
00:13:15.920 --> 00:13:19.680
a Senator from Illinois with a tiny body under hedge. So oversized,

243
00:13:19.920 --> 00:13:20.681
it turned in the nickname.

244
00:13:20.681 --> 00:13:24.920
The little giant Douglas stood against Buchanan at the 1852 democratic

245
00:13:24.921 --> 00:13:25.500
convention,

246
00:13:25.500 --> 00:13:28.840
but their fight for the nomination was so bitter that it dynamited both of their

247
00:13:28.841 --> 00:13:32.800
chances with neither backing down the conventioned for a compromised candidate,

248
00:13:32.801 --> 00:13:34.120
declaring little known Franklin,

249
00:13:34.610 --> 00:13:39.070
the winner still Pierce's nomination and eventual win needn't have been bad for

250
00:13:39.071 --> 00:13:39.650
the Buchanan.

251
00:13:39.650 --> 00:13:43.990
His old buddy Colonel king was Pierce's VP pick and selected alongside him.

252
00:13:44.050 --> 00:13:47.230
But while Buchana doubtlessly celebrated his friend's triumph,

253
00:13:47.231 --> 00:13:50.230
it was a short lived party on April the 18th, 1853,

254
00:13:50.950 --> 00:13:52.550
William Mark King died following a long illness.

255
00:13:52.700 --> 00:13:56.140
When he got the news older buck was devastated. What could he do?

256
00:13:56.620 --> 00:13:58.260
He'd accepted a posting to England from Pierce.

257
00:13:58.740 --> 00:14:02.180
All Buchanan could do now was board the boat and try to hide his deep

258
00:14:02.260 --> 00:14:06.100
overwhelming grief while things clearly sucked on a personal level though,

259
00:14:06.101 --> 00:14:08.660
on a professional level, the timing couldn't have been better.

260
00:14:08.920 --> 00:14:12.300
His new post meant Buchanan was far enough away to survive the oncoming

261
00:14:12.301 --> 00:14:13.134
political storm.

262
00:14:13.240 --> 00:14:17.210
So remember all that territory that the USCS from Mexico while those territories

263
00:14:17.350 --> 00:14:21.090
now wanted to be admitted as states trouble was Congress was sensitively

264
00:14:21.091 --> 00:14:25.530
balanced between free en slaved states and both sides were super jumpy about the

265
00:14:25.690 --> 00:14:27.410
newcomers, making them a permanent minority.

266
00:14:27.600 --> 00:14:30.290
This had initially led to the compromise of 1850,

267
00:14:30.300 --> 00:14:33.370
which among other things cemented the idea of popular sovereignty,

268
00:14:33.371 --> 00:14:36.720
deciding if a new state was free or slave,

269
00:14:36.780 --> 00:14:41.440
but this only made the Kansas Nebraska act so much worse in 1854 Buchanan's

270
00:14:41.441 --> 00:14:43.440
nemesis. Stephen Douglas tried to pass a bill,

271
00:14:43.441 --> 00:14:46.760
organizing the territory of Nebraska into two separate territories,

272
00:14:47.200 --> 00:14:50.800
Nebraska and Kansas Douglas did this to keep pushing the us west,

273
00:14:51.020 --> 00:14:54.080
but because he was unable to pass his bill without Southern support,

274
00:14:54.220 --> 00:14:56.560
he threw in a clause about these new territories,

275
00:14:56.680 --> 00:14:59.480
deciding the slavery issue by popular vote.

276
00:14:59.590 --> 00:15:04.080
This took a gigantic dump all over the long standing Missouri compromise,

277
00:15:04.081 --> 00:15:07.680
which had outlawed slavery north of the 36 30 parallel.

278
00:15:08.400 --> 00:15:12.030
So when the bill passed it set off a crazed rush,

279
00:15:12.140 --> 00:15:14.310
sensing an opportunity to tip the Kansas vote.

280
00:15:14.410 --> 00:15:16.190
New settlers from both slave states,

281
00:15:16.510 --> 00:15:19.510
Missouri and the free north poured into the territory.

282
00:15:19.540 --> 00:15:24.230
Predictably all hell broke loose in sustained vigilante violence known as

283
00:15:24.430 --> 00:15:24.511
bleeding,

284
00:15:24.511 --> 00:15:28.510
Kansas dozens were killed and simmering intentions were sent skyrocketing across

285
00:15:28.511 --> 00:15:29.010
the nation.

286
00:15:29.010 --> 00:15:33.140
It also annihilated the reputations of the Kansas Nebraska acts back as Stephen

287
00:15:33.140 --> 00:15:37.540
Douglas and Franklin Pierce suddenly the 1856 democratic nomination was back in

288
00:15:37.541 --> 00:15:41.180
play, but by then Buchanan was having his own PR problems. In 1853,

289
00:15:41.181 --> 00:15:45.300
Buchanan had met America's ministers to Spain and France in Austin Belgium to

290
00:15:45.301 --> 00:15:47.740
discuss Spain's refusal to sell Cuba paranoid.

291
00:15:47.741 --> 00:15:51.730
A slave vol on the islands might prompt a similar uprising in the south B and

292
00:15:51.731 --> 00:15:55.850
helped prepare a cable urging Pierce to annex Cuba. Unfortunately,

293
00:15:55.950 --> 00:16:00.290
the cable was made public and abolitionists and free soils. [inaudible] brick,

294
00:16:00.291 --> 00:16:03.810
thanks to his conviction that the us constitution upheld the rights of slave

295
00:16:03.811 --> 00:16:04.131
states.

296
00:16:04.131 --> 00:16:08.730
Buchanan was already seen as a dough face northerner with Southern sympathies.

297
00:16:08.910 --> 00:16:11.850
Now the OST manifesto also made him look like an imperialist,

298
00:16:12.300 --> 00:16:15.120
trying to spread the south peculiar institution.

299
00:16:15.180 --> 00:16:18.640
The result was to make Buchanan extremely unpalatable to Northern voters,

300
00:16:19.180 --> 00:16:21.680
but the opposite was also true within the democratic party.

301
00:16:21.780 --> 00:16:25.360
The Southern wing began to see Buchanan as more than just an ally.

302
00:16:25.361 --> 00:16:28.320
It began to see him as a southerner in orbit name.

303
00:16:28.510 --> 00:16:31.240
This meant that when Buchanan tried for the nomination again,

304
00:16:31.340 --> 00:16:34.390
he was going to have to rely on the slave states to win.

305
00:16:34.490 --> 00:16:38.470
But this new allegiance would come at a terrible cost, not only for old bark,

306
00:16:39.010 --> 00:16:39.990
but for all America.

307
00:16:45.220 --> 00:16:48.990
When James Buchana emerged triumph ands at the 1856 democratic convention,

308
00:16:49.130 --> 00:16:52.750
the news has greeted less with a cheer and more with a,

309
00:16:54.340 --> 00:16:58.020
although a serious player Buchana hasn't won because anyone thought it'd be a

310
00:16:58.021 --> 00:17:00.620
great nominee, but because he was the only person,

311
00:17:00.850 --> 00:17:04.020
both southerners and northerners might back by now,

312
00:17:04.021 --> 00:17:06.540
it was clear that the nation was splitting at the seams.

313
00:17:06.600 --> 00:17:08.660
The months before the convention of pro slavery,

314
00:17:09.260 --> 00:17:12.700
Mord sacked the free town of Lawrence in Kansas, in retaliation abolitionist,

315
00:17:12.701 --> 00:17:16.250
John Brown, randomly murdered five pro slavery settlers.

316
00:17:16.270 --> 00:17:19.970
The violins had even spread to the capital on may the 22nd Preston Brooks had

317
00:17:20.160 --> 00:17:22.210
viciously beaten Senator Charles Sumner,

318
00:17:22.370 --> 00:17:25.930
half to death in the chamber for an anti-slavery speech. Things were so tense.

319
00:17:25.931 --> 00:17:28.570
Buchanan. Wasn't sure about accepting the nomination writing.

320
00:17:28.850 --> 00:17:31.490
I had hoped for the nomination in 1844,

321
00:17:31.700 --> 00:17:35.400
again in 1848 and in 1852,

322
00:17:35.620 --> 00:17:38.240
but now I would hesitate to take it before many years,

323
00:17:38.260 --> 00:17:40.600
the abolitionists will bring war upon this land.

324
00:17:40.860 --> 00:17:45.320
It may come during the next presidential term yet for all the precedent of that

325
00:17:45.321 --> 00:17:48.400
statement. The fact was Buchanan had now spent over a decade,

326
00:17:48.550 --> 00:17:53.200
conniving and scheming to get the top job and 1856 promised

327
00:17:53.840 --> 00:17:55.680
and easy race. The week party had collapsed.

328
00:17:55.681 --> 00:17:58.320
The Republicans were still widely seen as too radical to win.

329
00:17:58.580 --> 00:18:02.240
If ever an election would be a cake walk. It was 1856.

330
00:18:02.340 --> 00:18:06.320
So despite his reservations, Buchanan went for it on November the fourth,

331
00:18:06.420 --> 00:18:08.080
the Democrats handedly on the white house,

332
00:18:08.150 --> 00:18:10.630
Buch was on track to become the 15th president.

333
00:18:11.270 --> 00:18:14.710
See that saying be careful what you wish for Wellby cannons wish was about to

334
00:18:14.711 --> 00:18:18.750
sour quicker than one. Granted by a possessed monkey sport. Back in February,

335
00:18:18.751 --> 00:18:20.910
the Supreme court begun to hear the case of dread Scott,

336
00:18:20.990 --> 00:18:24.590
a slave who accompanied his master to a free state and tried to Sue for his

337
00:18:24.591 --> 00:18:26.990
freedom. Since the case could have massive implications.

338
00:18:27.090 --> 00:18:29.380
The entire nation was nervously waiting on the verdict,

339
00:18:29.410 --> 00:18:32.300
including the president's elect in early 1857,

340
00:18:32.301 --> 00:18:35.580
Buchanan broke with ethical practice to write to some of the justices,

341
00:18:35.581 --> 00:18:37.620
pressuring them for advanced news of the outcome.

342
00:18:37.760 --> 00:18:41.500
He may have even prodded one in his preferred direction, either way.

343
00:18:41.520 --> 00:18:44.220
He got the answer he wanted on March the fourth, 1857,

344
00:18:44.260 --> 00:18:47.940
a confident James Buchanan told his inauguration crowd that the slavery issue

345
00:18:48.080 --> 00:18:51.810
was about to be settled and everyone should abide by the ruling. Two days later,

346
00:18:51.830 --> 00:18:56.130
the Supreme court issued its decision and without Buchanan's dreams of a unified

347
00:18:56.131 --> 00:18:59.650
nation collapsed the court. Didn't just rule that slaves had no rights,

348
00:18:59.651 --> 00:19:02.690
but also that the Missouri compromise had been unconstitutional.

349
00:19:02.750 --> 00:19:06.490
So they struck it down. Meaning slavery could now spread north unchecked.

350
00:19:06.550 --> 00:19:09.610
It was perhaps the most explosive ruling in us history.

351
00:19:09.710 --> 00:19:12.000
If desegregation was a bomb going off,

352
00:19:12.160 --> 00:19:16.120
then dread Scott was a political crack of to if Rowan Wade is a lining rod,

353
00:19:16.430 --> 00:19:17.880
this was a nuclear weapon.

354
00:19:17.980 --> 00:19:21.720
The ruling effectively shreded what few bonds remains between north and south.

355
00:19:22.160 --> 00:19:25.640
While Buchanan tried to dilute the backlash by appointing a cabinet moderates,

356
00:19:25.980 --> 00:19:28.200
the damage was done. Buchanan's honeymoon period.

357
00:19:28.460 --> 00:19:33.390
If it ever existed was over from now on, everything was gonna be downhill

358
00:19:38.870 --> 00:19:42.590
Seen today. James Buchanan single time is like watching a clown car filled with

359
00:19:42.660 --> 00:19:45.950
nitroglycerin slowly, roll toward an orphanage, somehow pathetic,

360
00:19:46.220 --> 00:19:50.550
fascinating and tragic all at the same time, things kicked off right away,

361
00:19:51.260 --> 00:19:55.380
a Compton constitution back in 1855 vote rigging an intimidation had led to the

362
00:19:55.381 --> 00:19:58.020
Kansas territory, electing a pro slavery legislature,

363
00:19:58.021 --> 00:20:01.740
which had then written a constitution that could be boiled down to well slavery.

364
00:20:02.620 --> 00:20:05.180
Yeah, thanks to that whole vote rigging thing.

365
00:20:05.181 --> 00:20:07.460
Most congressmen worth a rejecting this constitution,

366
00:20:07.770 --> 00:20:12.210
even Buchanan's advisors told him it was a non-starter, but for whatever reason,

367
00:20:12.211 --> 00:20:15.250
Buchanan decided this was the hill. He was gonna die on the president,

368
00:20:15.251 --> 00:20:17.290
pressed hard for the Le Compton constitution,

369
00:20:17.680 --> 00:20:21.130
despite it being Anas to his party's Northern wing.

370
00:20:21.280 --> 00:20:22.970
When that wing offered a compromise,

371
00:20:23.040 --> 00:20:25.650
whereby the pro slavery constitution would be passed,

372
00:20:25.670 --> 00:20:30.090
but open to amendment by a popular majority at any time, the Buchanan refused.

373
00:20:30.150 --> 00:20:33.200
The result was Northern Democrats under Buchanan, old enemy, Stephen Douglas,

374
00:20:33.201 --> 00:20:35.960
joining with the Republicans to kill the Kansas constitution.

375
00:20:36.080 --> 00:20:39.280
Buchanan had off northerners and divided his party,

376
00:20:40.400 --> 00:20:41.320
onlys getting nothing in return.

377
00:20:41.380 --> 00:20:44.120
It was a pattern that would continue for four whole years.

378
00:20:44.260 --> 00:20:46.680
Now we don't wanna give the impression that Buchanan's lack of leadership was

379
00:20:46.681 --> 00:20:48.560
the only thing causing America to crumble.

380
00:20:48.610 --> 00:20:53.000
There were plenty of factors beyond his control, such as the panic of 1857,

381
00:20:53.001 --> 00:20:57.920
that wall up the economy or John Brown's 1859 raid on Harper's ferry in

382
00:20:58.080 --> 00:20:59.760
an attempt to spark a slave uprising.

383
00:20:59.940 --> 00:21:04.200
Yet we also shouldn't underestimate the role Buchanan himself played in the

384
00:21:04.201 --> 00:21:07.190
March to war, despite favoring bridge, building Buchanan,

385
00:21:07.191 --> 00:21:10.790
reflexively sided with the slave states and almost all issues declaring of the

386
00:21:10.791 --> 00:21:11.990
south as sovereign stage.

387
00:21:12.180 --> 00:21:16.430
They and they alone are responsible before gardens the world for slavery

388
00:21:16.950 --> 00:21:17.870
existing among them for this,

389
00:21:17.871 --> 00:21:21.470
the people of the north are not more responsible and have no more right to

390
00:21:21.471 --> 00:21:25.430
interfere than with similar institutions and Russia or in Brazil.

391
00:21:25.610 --> 00:21:26.910
But while I wasn't true,

392
00:21:27.280 --> 00:21:31.940
the fugitive slave act since the end of the Missouri compromise slavery was very

393
00:21:31.941 --> 00:21:34.900
much a live issue for the north. More than that, it was a crusade,

394
00:21:34.960 --> 00:21:36.060
one confronting an evil.

395
00:21:36.061 --> 00:21:40.980
So imoral abolitionists felt they had to use every tool to fight its expansion.

396
00:21:41.040 --> 00:21:42.420
By the time 1860 arrived,

397
00:21:42.421 --> 00:21:45.660
then Butte Cannon's administration was weak and the federal government was

398
00:21:45.690 --> 00:21:50.090
paralyzed. Luckily Bana had promised to step down after one turn less.

399
00:21:50.091 --> 00:21:53.930
Luckily he wasn't going to let his party choose a unifying success at,

400
00:21:54.170 --> 00:21:56.290
at the night of the 1860 democratic convention.

401
00:21:56.291 --> 00:21:59.610
Buchanan's allies lobbied hard to deny Stephen Douglas, the nomination,

402
00:21:59.630 --> 00:22:00.171
as a result,

403
00:22:00.171 --> 00:22:03.090
the party split into two camps representing the north and the south.

404
00:22:03.160 --> 00:22:04.810
This meant that on election day,

405
00:22:04.811 --> 00:22:09.480
the more unified Republicans could NAB the white house taking less than

406
00:22:09.481 --> 00:22:13.040
40% of the popular vote in the aftermath of Abraham Lincoln's win.

407
00:22:13.040 --> 00:22:16.760
Buchanan seems to have finally woken up to the danger of succession on December

408
00:22:16.761 --> 00:22:17.360
the sixth,

409
00:22:17.360 --> 00:22:20.800
the called for a new constitutional convention to find a new way forward for

410
00:22:20.801 --> 00:22:21.800
America. But by then,

411
00:22:21.860 --> 00:22:26.280
it was far too late to show any leadership rather than live under a Republican

412
00:22:26.281 --> 00:22:26.770
president.

413
00:22:26.770 --> 00:22:30.550
South Carolina announced its session from the union on December the 20th,

414
00:22:30.551 --> 00:22:32.830
within six weeks, six more states had followed yet.

415
00:22:32.831 --> 00:22:37.070
Even now at the height of the crisis, Buchanan failed to act till the very end.

416
00:22:37.630 --> 00:22:41.150
It was unwilling to face down Southern interests instead letting the states

417
00:22:41.160 --> 00:22:43.910
leave and the Confederacy establish itself.

418
00:22:44.010 --> 00:22:47.510
But he also refused to turn over any federal thoughts to the south.

419
00:22:47.511 --> 00:22:50.620
Even sending reinforcement to Sumter in early 1861,

420
00:22:50.720 --> 00:22:54.860
yet the relief ship wound up turning back to avoid sparking a fight by early

421
00:22:54.861 --> 00:22:56.660
March. It was clear to most in Washington,

422
00:22:56.940 --> 00:22:58.740
the Buchana was simply running down the clock,

423
00:22:58.760 --> 00:23:00.900
trying to avoid war just long enough.

424
00:23:00.900 --> 00:23:04.980
So the responsibility would fall on his success app in this, if nothing else,

425
00:23:04.981 --> 00:23:07.460
he succeeded James Buchana left office on March the fourth,

426
00:23:07.700 --> 00:23:09.500
1861 a little over a month later,

427
00:23:09.770 --> 00:23:14.170
you a South Carolina militia bombarded for Sumter and the civil war began in

428
00:23:14.171 --> 00:23:15.250
retirement. Outta Pennsylvania.

429
00:23:15.370 --> 00:23:19.050
Buchanan lived long enough to witness the carnage that followed the hundreds of

430
00:23:19.250 --> 00:23:22.010
thousands dead. The destruction of once great cities.

431
00:23:22.150 --> 00:23:26.170
He also witnessed his reputation fall into an Abys Baals to face his portrait in

432
00:23:26.171 --> 00:23:29.090
the capital. The Senate drafted resolutions, condemning him.

433
00:23:29.330 --> 00:23:31.560
Although Buchanan would try and hit back with a book,

434
00:23:31.561 --> 00:23:34.000
pinning all the blame for the war on the abolitionists.

435
00:23:34.001 --> 00:23:38.400
The narrative was already set and it's never changed since James Buchana died a

436
00:23:38.401 --> 00:23:40.800
virtual harm on the 1st of June, 1868,

437
00:23:41.060 --> 00:23:45.040
by then he was so unpopular that he barely left the house. He went to his grave,

438
00:23:45.120 --> 00:23:47.760
believing history would vindicate him that one day.

439
00:23:47.960 --> 00:23:50.320
Future dudes would look back on his presidency, not as a disaster,

440
00:23:50.460 --> 00:23:55.280
but the work of a good man doing the right thing fast forward over 150 years.

441
00:23:56.060 --> 00:23:57.520
And that still hasn't happened today.

442
00:23:57.521 --> 00:24:00.840
James Buchanan remains perhaps the least loved president in us history known

443
00:24:00.841 --> 00:24:03.240
only for his catastrophic failure to prevent the civil war.

444
00:24:03.241 --> 00:24:07.110
Certainly it's a hard to disagree with that assessment in recent videos,

445
00:24:07.111 --> 00:24:10.910
we've tried to highlight the overlooked good sides of bad presidents like Warren

446
00:24:11.070 --> 00:24:14.230
G Hardings anti-racism or Herbert Hoover's humanitarian work. Yep.

447
00:24:14.231 --> 00:24:17.030
That's been almost impossible with James Buchanan.

448
00:24:17.270 --> 00:24:20.750
Here was a man who didn't do anything great before taking office who didn't have

449
00:24:20.751 --> 00:24:23.390
superhuman integrity or a particularly kind soul,

450
00:24:23.410 --> 00:24:25.500
or even a strong vision for the nation.

451
00:24:25.680 --> 00:24:29.700
And yet he also wasn't entirely that although it ended in miserable failure,

452
00:24:29.730 --> 00:24:34.020
there's perhaps something to be admired in Buchanan's dreams of compromise of

453
00:24:34.180 --> 00:24:36.100
building bridges instead of burning them down.

454
00:24:36.160 --> 00:24:40.100
Had he lived at another time or had he tried to find common grounds on an issue,

455
00:24:40.101 --> 00:24:43.340
less morally repugnance than slavery it's possible.

456
00:24:43.520 --> 00:24:46.490
He may have gone down as an Oak. Hey presidents,

457
00:24:46.590 --> 00:24:50.370
but James Buchanan's tragedy is that he didn't live in another era.

458
00:24:50.510 --> 00:24:53.090
He lived in one when America needed a strong leader,

459
00:24:53.250 --> 00:24:57.530
a president's unafraid to take a moral stand for his failure to do so.

460
00:24:57.840 --> 00:25:00.250
History has remembered him as the one thing.

461
00:25:00.270 --> 00:25:04.330
He couldn't abide a miserable failure. So I hope you found that video.

462
00:25:04.610 --> 00:25:06.960
Interesting. If he did, please do that's thumbs up button below.
