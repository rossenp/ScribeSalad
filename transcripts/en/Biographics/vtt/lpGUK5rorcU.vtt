00:00:00.090 --> 00:00:01.050
<v 0>Just before we get started,</v>

2
00:00:01.051 --> 00:00:03.810
I do want to say that this video is brought to you by me,

3
00:00:03.811 --> 00:00:07.470
or rather another channel that I do called business plays. It's about business,

4
00:00:07.770 --> 00:00:11.760
but it's fun by if you're wondering what goes on here. Danny writes the scripts.

5
00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:13.740
I read them and react to them.

6
00:00:13.950 --> 00:00:17.760
Occasionally I give them a little Slack because why not?

7
00:00:17.850 --> 00:00:20.760
It looks at the most Epic failures and times things went wrong,

8
00:00:20.761 --> 00:00:22.530
but also little known successes.

9
00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:26.580
I guess these are like stakes where rich people, exactly what I'm talking about.

10
00:00:26.610 --> 00:00:30.590
Generally, just the weirdest stuff that I could find from the business world.

11
00:00:30.591 --> 00:00:34.460
Like why you found note in the UK, mostly for criminal, stuff like that.

12
00:00:34.461 --> 00:00:36.270
It's more laid back than this. Sorry.

13
00:00:36.271 --> 00:00:39.380
I get good amounts of silliness and fun of you along with some facts.

14
00:00:39.410 --> 00:00:43.190
Check it out through the link below and let's get into today's video.

15
00:00:49.670 --> 00:00:50.503
<v 1>Find smart.</v>

16
00:00:50.630 --> 00:00:54.620
<v 0>A few and score big. That was the credo, which going to English pirate,</v>

17
00:00:54.650 --> 00:00:56.810
Samuel Black, Sam Belleny.

18
00:00:57.050 --> 00:01:00.770
He was sometimes called the Prince of pirates because he treated both his crew

19
00:01:00.771 --> 00:01:03.200
and his captives with fairness and mercy,

20
00:01:03.380 --> 00:01:07.010
but also because he liked to dress in fancy clothes and exhibited polite

21
00:01:07.011 --> 00:01:07.580
manners.

22
00:01:07.580 --> 00:01:11.090
He also called himself the Robin hood of the sea while his crew were Robin

23
00:01:11.330 --> 00:01:13.580
Hood's men, while he certainly took from the rich,

24
00:01:13.820 --> 00:01:18.710
he didn't go so far as to give to the poor. He was still a pirate after rule.

25
00:01:18.770 --> 00:01:23.390
This strategy of being a benevolence buck and near was not one adopted by many

26
00:01:23.391 --> 00:01:24.330
other pirate captain.

27
00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:27.590
So you prefer to rule over the seas through Dara and chaos,

28
00:01:27.591 --> 00:01:31.190
but it is certainly one that worked for Bellamy. Despite a very short career.

29
00:01:31.191 --> 00:01:35.450
He may have ended it as the richest pirates in history with modern estimates,

30
00:01:35.451 --> 00:01:38.390
placing as wealth at around $120 million.

31
00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:47.630
Probably won't surprise you to learn that we don't know much about Bellamy's

32
00:01:47.690 --> 00:01:51.030
early years. And what we do know is a mixture of facts.

33
00:01:52.040 --> 00:01:53.720
Certainness rumors and legends.

34
00:01:53.780 --> 00:01:58.250
Samuel Bellamy was born circa 1689 to Steven and Elizabeth Bellamy and the small

35
00:01:58.251 --> 00:02:01.040
parish of hideously and Devin England.

36
00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:04.460
Some sources suggest March the 18th is the date of his birth,

37
00:02:04.490 --> 00:02:07.940
but others indicate that Elizabeth Bellamy died giving birth to Samuel sometime

38
00:02:07.941 --> 00:02:10.640
in February and the March, the 18th have been. In fact,

39
00:02:10.670 --> 00:02:13.880
the date of his baptism developing is on six children together.

40
00:02:13.881 --> 00:02:17.900
Although their only other son had already died by the time Samuel was born,

41
00:02:17.960 --> 00:02:20.750
this would have meant that the family farming cottage would have gone to him,

42
00:02:20.751 --> 00:02:25.010
but young Samuel had no inclination to become a farmer and work the land.

43
00:02:25.070 --> 00:02:29.210
Therefore he left home as soon as he was able and looks to the calmer sailor.

44
00:02:29.330 --> 00:02:33.080
Allegedly Samuel had become enamored with life on the sea from tales,

45
00:02:33.081 --> 00:02:34.880
detaining the adventures of Henry.

46
00:02:34.881 --> 00:02:39.680
Every another famous piratey proceeded him by a few decades and had been born in

47
00:02:39.681 --> 00:02:42.740
the same County, a short distance away from hit asleep.

48
00:02:43.150 --> 00:02:45.860
Despite Bellamy's young age and complete lack of experience,

49
00:02:45.861 --> 00:02:49.100
he would not have found it difficult to secure a spot, a board, a ship.

50
00:02:49.280 --> 00:02:52.910
This was during the height of maritime travel and both the Royal Navy and

51
00:02:52.911 --> 00:02:55.640
private merchant vessels were on the lookout for young sailors.

52
00:02:55.700 --> 00:02:59.860
They needed only been exacerbated by the start of the war of Spanish in

53
00:02:59.861 --> 00:03:02.830
1701. That same year, the 13 year old Bellamy.

54
00:03:02.890 --> 00:03:06.280
He secured a position as a ship's boy aboard a matching vessel.

55
00:03:06.520 --> 00:03:10.150
He spent the entire war at sea working his way up through the ranks.

56
00:03:10.180 --> 00:03:14.640
The conflict ended in 1714. And while we have no records of the positions,

57
00:03:14.641 --> 00:03:18.940
Samuel Bellamy, Aldons the ships he served on by the time the war was over,

58
00:03:19.030 --> 00:03:22.240
he was an experienced Seder sometime around 17, 15.

59
00:03:22.240 --> 00:03:26.170
He made his way to the new world and traveled to Cape Cod in Massachusetts,

60
00:03:26.350 --> 00:03:30.340
that he allegedly made the acquaintance of a young woman by the name of Mary or

61
00:03:30.520 --> 00:03:34.060
Maria Hallot. He charms her with tales of maritime adventures,

62
00:03:34.180 --> 00:03:37.330
and the two spent a night together afterwards. They wanted to wear it,

63
00:03:37.360 --> 00:03:40.600
but her parents who were wealthy landowners would not allow their daughter to

64
00:03:40.601 --> 00:03:44.920
marry a poor sailor from then on Bellamy swore that he would go out into the

65
00:03:44.921 --> 00:03:49.390
world, make his fortune and return to marry his beloved. As far as we can tell,

66
00:03:49.391 --> 00:03:51.430
Mary Hollis never met Bellamy again,

67
00:03:51.670 --> 00:03:55.000
but she ends in new England's law in her own way is the sea,

68
00:03:55.270 --> 00:03:57.160
which of Billingsgate. According to legends,

69
00:03:57.161 --> 00:04:00.910
Mary became pregnant following her encounter with a future pirate months later

70
00:04:00.911 --> 00:04:01.810
on a cold winter night,

71
00:04:01.811 --> 00:04:04.990
she was found in a bond and a counselor's Sonic stage cradling a dead baby in

72
00:04:04.991 --> 00:04:07.330
her arms. It was the belief of the entire community.

73
00:04:07.400 --> 00:04:11.740
The younger that killed her loved child. So obviously she needed to be punished.

74
00:04:11.830 --> 00:04:15.760
First. She was taken to the middle of town, tied to a post and webs afterwards.

75
00:04:15.790 --> 00:04:19.720
She was imprisoned and tortured daily until the arrival of a trial where she

76
00:04:19.721 --> 00:04:22.480
would surely have been found guilty and executed every day.

77
00:04:22.510 --> 00:04:24.610
The town filled with Mary's wailing and screaming.

78
00:04:25.120 --> 00:04:28.300
The girl pleaded with a capitalist to simply let her die,

79
00:04:28.690 --> 00:04:31.510
but they refused one day a visitor approached Mary's cell.

80
00:04:31.660 --> 00:04:34.600
He was a well-dressed well-spoken man with a gold tip walking cane.

81
00:04:34.870 --> 00:04:39.130
He talked with Mary and convinced her that the entire world hated her and wanted

82
00:04:39.131 --> 00:04:41.110
to make her suffer. That's how rage grew.

83
00:04:41.200 --> 00:04:43.660
The mountain produced a contract and made her an offer.

84
00:04:43.870 --> 00:04:47.950
She couldn't refuse her freedom and to Sean's for revenge by simply signing on

85
00:04:47.951 --> 00:04:49.390
the dotted line. And on that day,

86
00:04:49.391 --> 00:04:52.810
Mary Hallot sold her soul to the devil and it became the sea witch of

87
00:04:52.811 --> 00:04:54.640
Billingsgate. From that point on the,

88
00:04:54.820 --> 00:04:57.820
which lived inside a whale that carried a ship's light on its tail.

89
00:04:57.850 --> 00:05:01.210
She used the lights to Nour ships onto lands where the sea,

90
00:05:01.211 --> 00:05:03.310
which would prey on the unsuspecting sailors,

91
00:05:03.311 --> 00:05:07.420
taking their lives and their souls in a different version of the story.

92
00:05:07.421 --> 00:05:08.680
People tell about ghost,

93
00:05:08.681 --> 00:05:11.590
which can sometimes still be seen on the shores of Cape Cod,

94
00:05:11.740 --> 00:05:13.930
as she waits for her lover to return to her.

95
00:05:20.220 --> 00:05:21.053
<v 1>Okay.</v>

96
00:05:21.420 --> 00:05:21.470
<v 0>Developing.</v>

97
00:05:21.470 --> 00:05:24.990
He was now faced with the same dilemma that troubled many sailors of his time

98
00:05:25.050 --> 00:05:28.170
with the war over there were significantly fewer opportunities than the were

99
00:05:28.190 --> 00:05:32.370
before. However, the only thing Belamine knew how to do was sailor ship,

100
00:05:32.430 --> 00:05:35.850
many other seamen who found themselves in the situation thought they had no

101
00:05:35.851 --> 00:05:38.100
alternative, but to turn to piracy,

102
00:05:38.130 --> 00:05:41.850
but this was not actually the immediate decision taken by Bellamy.

103
00:05:41.910 --> 00:05:44.790
That first he wanted to be a treasure Hunter. During his time in new England,

104
00:05:44.820 --> 00:05:48.810
Bellamy made the acquaintance of a silversmith named Paul Graves Williams or

105
00:05:49.170 --> 00:05:51.780
Paul's grave, or simply Paul. He was older than Bellamy,

106
00:05:51.840 --> 00:05:55.290
almost 40 years old and prominent family that was descended from English

107
00:05:55.770 --> 00:05:58.610
royalty. How are they? His stepfather had involved in some shady dealings,

108
00:05:58.611 --> 00:06:03.080
such as smuggling and the black markets and his closing of the law rubbed off on

109
00:06:03.081 --> 00:06:05.570
Williams and his siblings, allegedly Paul's sister,

110
00:06:05.571 --> 00:06:07.550
even married a man named Edward sands.

111
00:06:07.550 --> 00:06:10.580
He was a friend of the notorious pirate captain kids.

112
00:06:10.581 --> 00:06:13.400
And the couple even helped him set his contraband.

113
00:06:13.820 --> 00:06:16.430
Therefore just like Bellamy Williams grew a desire to leave his wife and

114
00:06:16.431 --> 00:06:19.970
children behind and set sail for adventure. Cool. Listen,

115
00:06:20.180 --> 00:06:23.090
18th century version of a midlife crisis. Anyway,

116
00:06:23.180 --> 00:06:27.650
he met Bellamy and the two bonded over their mutual disaster escapades on the

117
00:06:27.651 --> 00:06:29.540
high seas. But like we said,

118
00:06:29.750 --> 00:06:33.200
they didn't immediately decide to become pirates that fast.

119
00:06:33.201 --> 00:06:35.510
They wanted to try their luck at salvaging treasure.

120
00:06:35.750 --> 00:06:40.100
They even had a prize in mind, the Spanish treasure fleet earlier that year,

121
00:06:40.101 --> 00:06:43.070
a fleet of 12 Spanish ships left Havana headed for Spain.

122
00:06:43.071 --> 00:06:47.390
And they were all filled with gold, silver jewels coins, and other valuables.

123
00:06:47.420 --> 00:06:50.840
They encountered a hurricane there's 11 of those ships were sunk off the coast

124
00:06:50.841 --> 00:06:54.020
of Florida taking wisdom, all of that treasure ever since then,

125
00:06:54.021 --> 00:06:57.860
people like Belamine Williams gushed over the idea of recovering even a small

126
00:06:57.861 --> 00:07:00.320
fraction of that news and living like Kings,

127
00:07:00.350 --> 00:07:03.620
the duo entered a partnership together with Bellamy's sailing know-how and

128
00:07:03.621 --> 00:07:05.240
Williams as money and connections.

129
00:07:05.240 --> 00:07:08.960
They would assemble a crew and try to salvage one of the Spanish ships while

130
00:07:08.961 --> 00:07:13.280
they found out for when they got there was that every other sailor in salvage in

131
00:07:13.281 --> 00:07:17.180
the region had the same idea. Many had even been hot by the Spanish crown,

132
00:07:17.181 --> 00:07:20.570
which was desperately trying to regain its valuable cargo that let me in

133
00:07:20.571 --> 00:07:24.410
Williams alongside all the other crews in the area worked for a few months,

134
00:07:24.411 --> 00:07:25.880
but with little success,

135
00:07:25.940 --> 00:07:29.360
they found some coins in jewels that had been taken by currents and made their

136
00:07:29.361 --> 00:07:30.500
way to the ocean floor,

137
00:07:30.650 --> 00:07:33.500
but they couldn't locate the main whole section of the ship,

138
00:07:33.680 --> 00:07:36.830
which would have contained the bulk of the loot by early 17,

139
00:07:36.831 --> 00:07:40.820
16 Spanish reinforcements arrived in the area and they drove away all the

140
00:07:40.821 --> 00:07:43.310
independent treasure hunters like Bellamy and Williams.

141
00:07:43.550 --> 00:07:47.270
Their expedition had been a complete failure and they hated the idea of going

142
00:07:47.271 --> 00:07:48.710
back to new England empty handed.

143
00:07:48.830 --> 00:07:53.030
It was only one solution that was left to them and it was piracy.

144
00:08:00.070 --> 00:08:00.130
<v 1>[Inaudible].</v>

145
00:08:00.130 --> 00:08:04.090
<v 0>So both Bellamy and Williams hoisted the black flag and became pirates.</v>

146
00:08:04.120 --> 00:08:06.520
The former became known as black Sam Bellamy.

147
00:08:06.550 --> 00:08:09.460
Although he probably first attains the nickname back in new England.

148
00:08:09.550 --> 00:08:12.790
Allegedly people called him this because he did not like wearing those large

149
00:08:12.791 --> 00:08:17.050
white pounded wigs and instead preferred to let his own long black half flow,

150
00:08:17.260 --> 00:08:19.120
tying it back with a simple bands.

151
00:08:19.330 --> 00:08:22.930
He and Williams first traveled to central America to the Gulf of Honduras,

152
00:08:22.931 --> 00:08:24.940
where they recruited men to join that crew.

153
00:08:25.030 --> 00:08:27.610
Of course they would also need a ship and it's like most pirates.

154
00:08:27.611 --> 00:08:29.920
They started out small Williams and Bellamy,

155
00:08:29.921 --> 00:08:33.070
both commanded watercraft scored perianal, GWAS. They were small,

156
00:08:33.071 --> 00:08:35.770
but good enough to get the job done. Soon afterwards,

157
00:08:35.771 --> 00:08:37.750
they managed to take the first problems in the region.

158
00:08:37.930 --> 00:08:41.650
A Dutch merchant ship afterwards came another prize and English sloop commanded

159
00:08:41.651 --> 00:08:44.740
by captain young, they use the ship to travel to Cuba,

160
00:08:44.770 --> 00:08:47.320
tying off their ships to the sides of the vessel.

161
00:08:47.590 --> 00:08:50.350
That's only in Cuba did not start off or spaciously.

162
00:08:50.410 --> 00:08:52.810
The first ships they encountered were a group of four.

163
00:08:53.320 --> 00:08:56.670
Sloops flying the English flag under the of captain Henry Jennings.

164
00:08:56.850 --> 00:08:58.800
The pirates were outnumbered and outgunned,

165
00:08:59.040 --> 00:09:02.640
so they had no intention of provoking a fight. Instead they gave captain young,

166
00:09:02.820 --> 00:09:05.970
his ship back climbs into their ships and rode there.

167
00:09:06.150 --> 00:09:09.420
Little heart sounds into shallow waters where they knew the snoops couldn't

168
00:09:09.421 --> 00:09:13.050
follow them. Only later did they learn that Jennings himself was also a pirate.

169
00:09:13.051 --> 00:09:15.090
So he had no interest in pursuing them,

170
00:09:15.120 --> 00:09:18.630
but he did plunge that captain young ship off to this Lisel incidence,

171
00:09:18.631 --> 00:09:20.640
the two crews disbanded for a short time.

172
00:09:20.641 --> 00:09:24.510
It seems like Bellamy's pirate Korea would. And as soon as it started,

173
00:09:24.511 --> 00:09:26.370
but as fortunately, this took a turn for the better.

174
00:09:26.490 --> 00:09:29.280
When he and Williams met captain Benjamin Horner gold,

175
00:09:29.460 --> 00:09:33.360
by that point on a gold was already a famous and feared pirate in those waters.

176
00:09:33.570 --> 00:09:36.240
It also taken on an apprentice named Edward teach,

177
00:09:36.270 --> 00:09:39.870
who would become better known as the notorious Blackbeard in the near future.

178
00:09:39.871 --> 00:09:43.830
We've already done a video about him. You can easily find that on our channel.

179
00:09:43.920 --> 00:09:47.250
Anyway, he decided there was room for two more men aboard his fleet.

180
00:09:47.400 --> 00:09:51.510
So Bellamy and Williams joined his crew soon enough Balam he began impressing

181
00:09:51.511 --> 00:09:53.580
everyone with his nautical skills and knowledge.

182
00:09:53.730 --> 00:09:57.900
It became evidence that he was one of the most talented sailors in horny Gold's

183
00:09:57.901 --> 00:10:01.080
crew and started climbing through the ranks very quickly. In fact,

184
00:10:01.081 --> 00:10:01.861
in just a few months,

185
00:10:01.861 --> 00:10:05.100
even though Bellamy was young and the junior member of the crew, I want to,

186
00:10:05.370 --> 00:10:08.970
Gold's named him acting captain of one of the smaller ships ahead of others who

187
00:10:08.971 --> 00:10:12.690
had seniority over him. This was a productive period for Bellamy.

188
00:10:12.750 --> 00:10:15.510
He claims numerous prizes as part of horny Gold's crew.

189
00:10:15.690 --> 00:10:20.100
His fleet also aligned itself with the other French pirates at VA level,

190
00:10:20.550 --> 00:10:23.850
also known as laborious or the buzzard together.

191
00:10:23.851 --> 00:10:26.250
They formed quite a formidable maritime force.

192
00:10:26.790 --> 00:10:28.410
Levasseur himself was an interesting character.

193
00:10:28.411 --> 00:10:31.470
Whether you have a quick mention, he amassed a large treasure as a pirate,

194
00:10:31.500 --> 00:10:35.250
but was then caught and hanged in 1730 on the day of his execution.

195
00:10:35.251 --> 00:10:37.230
While sitting on the gallows, let us, uh,

196
00:10:37.590 --> 00:10:41.190
through a piece of parchment into the crowd saying that his treasure would

197
00:10:41.191 --> 00:10:43.950
belong to the one who will understand his message.

198
00:10:43.980 --> 00:10:47.910
The parchment was a treasure map and the form that they 17 line cryptogram ever

199
00:10:47.911 --> 00:10:49.620
since then people have been looking for.

200
00:10:49.621 --> 00:10:53.010
The hidden loot is generally believed to be buried on the islands of may in the

201
00:10:53.011 --> 00:10:56.910
Seychelles, but the mysterious cryptogram still remains unsolved.

202
00:10:56.970 --> 00:11:00.180
So back to Bellamy, his association with of gold didn't last long,

203
00:11:00.240 --> 00:11:03.060
the latter steadfastly refused to attack English ships.

204
00:11:03.090 --> 00:11:07.380
We don't know if this was out of a sense of patriotism or if it was because he

205
00:11:07.381 --> 00:11:11.520
wanted to claim that he was still a privateer in service of England's and not a

206
00:11:11.970 --> 00:11:14.550
full-on pirate either way. While if you doesn't have horn,

207
00:11:14.560 --> 00:11:18.660
a Gold's men might have held similar views. The vast majority did not.

208
00:11:18.661 --> 00:11:21.660
And this was a serious cause of frustration among the crew.

209
00:11:21.690 --> 00:11:25.170
The tension reached fever pitch during the summer of 1716,

210
00:11:25.171 --> 00:11:28.950
while holding a gold wins on a trip to The Bahamas, taking only his own ship,

211
00:11:28.951 --> 00:11:30.600
the adventure during that time,

212
00:11:30.630 --> 00:11:34.230
Bellamy and Levison ignored his mandate and took several English prizes.

213
00:11:34.470 --> 00:11:37.290
When horny gold refused and found out he was furious,

214
00:11:37.291 --> 00:11:41.100
but he soon discovered that most of his crew did not share his feelings.

215
00:11:41.190 --> 00:11:45.210
Eventually the men had had enough and wanted horny gold relieved of his command.

216
00:11:45.270 --> 00:11:48.420
A vote was taken and over three quarters of the men went against their now

217
00:11:48.421 --> 00:11:50.190
former captain. More than that though,

218
00:11:50.191 --> 00:11:54.670
they voted black Sam Bellamy as their new permanent around two dozen men stayed

219
00:11:54.671 --> 00:11:58.510
loyal to horn gold and set sail alone on one of the sloops while the rest of

220
00:11:58.770 --> 00:12:01.660
Ireland themselves, between the cruise of Bellamy. And let us sit up.

221
00:12:01.750 --> 00:12:04.300
Paul Williams became Bellamy's new quartermaster.

222
00:12:10.290 --> 00:12:10.620
<v 1>[Inaudible].</v>

223
00:12:10.620 --> 00:12:11.730
<v 0>Bellamy's a sense of power.</v>

224
00:12:11.731 --> 00:12:15.690
Was something truly remarkable that had seldom been seen in maritime history,

225
00:12:15.840 --> 00:12:18.240
even among pirates, who were, you know,

226
00:12:18.420 --> 00:12:22.410
a bit looser on the old rules and regulations less than a year had passed since

227
00:12:22.411 --> 00:12:25.860
it left new England in the hopes of maybe making a living as a salvager.

228
00:12:26.100 --> 00:12:30.780
And now he was captain of his own ship with over 90 men under his command for

229
00:12:30.781 --> 00:12:33.510
the arranger of the Bellamy sailed together with liver syrup.

230
00:12:33.540 --> 00:12:36.750
They were a formidable duo and took numerous prizes.

231
00:12:36.960 --> 00:12:40.440
There were occasions when the pirates captured two ships in a single date,

232
00:12:41.010 --> 00:12:43.920
Bellamy would end his career as a pirate captain with over 50 prizes to his

233
00:12:43.921 --> 00:12:44.221
name.

234
00:12:44.221 --> 00:12:48.030
And most of them occurred during this time period among them was a British much

235
00:12:48.180 --> 00:12:51.810
and Galilee called the Sultana, which became Bellamy's new flagship.

236
00:12:51.840 --> 00:12:55.350
While Williams was given command of his previous vessel. The Maryanne of course,

237
00:12:55.380 --> 00:12:58.290
this kind of success did not go unnoticed for long.

238
00:12:58.500 --> 00:13:00.510
This was around the time that woods Rogers,

239
00:13:00.511 --> 00:13:04.560
the governor of The Bahamas vowed to get rid of piracy in his region.

240
00:13:04.561 --> 00:13:08.070
And it's successfully petitioned to obtain several British warships to protect

241
00:13:08.071 --> 00:13:11.070
his waters in early 17, 17. Now rant,

242
00:13:11.071 --> 00:13:14.160
his men concluded that it was time to seek safest seas.

243
00:13:14.190 --> 00:13:17.700
So they set sail for South America. Now, then he did not follow them though.

244
00:13:17.701 --> 00:13:21.240
Instead it was preferred to be able to stand and fight against the powerful

245
00:13:21.241 --> 00:13:24.840
British frigates, but for that he needed a bigger, stronger ship.

246
00:13:25.080 --> 00:13:29.010
He needed the widow galley. It was named after the kingdom of Witter,

247
00:13:29.130 --> 00:13:33.870
an African coastal territory today known as Benin back then it's as a major

248
00:13:33.871 --> 00:13:34.890
slave trading area.

249
00:13:34.891 --> 00:13:38.490
And the ship itself was commissioned by a wealthy London slave merchant and

250
00:13:38.491 --> 00:13:42.240
member of parliament names, Humphry Morris to serve as a slave galley.

251
00:13:42.480 --> 00:13:46.470
There would a galley left on its maiden voyage from England in early 17, 16,

252
00:13:46.471 --> 00:13:50.130
and traveled to Africa to collect slaves and valuables such as gold and ivory.

253
00:13:50.220 --> 00:13:52.140
The ship was captained by Lawrence Prince,

254
00:13:52.141 --> 00:13:56.250
a Dutch officer who previously served as a privateer under captain Henry Morgan.

255
00:13:56.460 --> 00:13:59.010
It then went to the Caribbean where it traded for other commodities,

256
00:13:59.011 --> 00:14:03.710
such as rum, sugar, dyes, and spices in February 17, 17, the Witter gallery.

257
00:14:03.720 --> 00:14:05.940
It was on its way back to England to do this though,

258
00:14:06.180 --> 00:14:09.450
attempted to reverse the treacherous waters of Cuba and The Bahamas,

259
00:14:09.600 --> 00:14:11.910
which were known to be rifle with pirates even.

260
00:14:11.911 --> 00:14:15.750
So captain Prince was confident that his ship had the speed and maneuverability

261
00:14:15.751 --> 00:14:18.240
to deal with whatever peril it might encounter.

262
00:14:18.480 --> 00:14:21.270
Eventually what he expected to happen happens.

263
00:14:21.300 --> 00:14:23.310
Prince notice that there were two ships following him,

264
00:14:23.400 --> 00:14:25.500
a warship and a sleep of walk. At first,

265
00:14:25.501 --> 00:14:28.410
he hoped that these might be British vessels coming out of Jamaica,

266
00:14:28.440 --> 00:14:31.500
but he soon realized that he was being chased by pirates.

267
00:14:31.710 --> 00:14:35.790
It was black Sam Bellamy in the Sultana followed closely by Williams,

268
00:14:36.180 --> 00:14:39.780
bought the Marianne captain Prince decided that his best course of action was to

269
00:14:39.781 --> 00:14:42.690
run. His ship was faster. So he should have been able to escape.

270
00:14:42.810 --> 00:14:45.840
The chase lasted three days and covered 300 miles of open water.

271
00:14:46.050 --> 00:14:49.440
But through superior seamanship the pirates managed to cap shop to the way to

272
00:14:49.800 --> 00:14:51.830
Ganni now came an important for Bellamy.

273
00:14:51.980 --> 00:14:55.460
He was fairly certain that he had the firepower to defeat the slave ship,

274
00:14:55.490 --> 00:14:59.420
but an all out battle with not only have damaged his own two vessels,

275
00:14:59.421 --> 00:15:04.010
but also the craft that he intended to commandeer. They were also in open water.

276
00:15:04.011 --> 00:15:07.400
So they wouldn't have been able to make any serious repairs. Of course,

277
00:15:07.460 --> 00:15:10.070
this last thought was also on Prince's mind.

278
00:15:10.080 --> 00:15:14.330
You realize that a fire has a great chance of sinking his ship that far off to

279
00:15:14.331 --> 00:15:17.630
adjust a couple of token Canon shots. He surrendered afterwards.

280
00:15:17.631 --> 00:15:20.990
He was relatively relieved to discover that Bellamy lived up to his reputation

281
00:15:20.991 --> 00:15:22.040
as a merciful captain.

282
00:15:22.310 --> 00:15:25.790
The Pirate's mood was undoubtedly improved when he discovered that the cargo

283
00:15:25.791 --> 00:15:26.960
holds, if the Witta galley,

284
00:15:27.050 --> 00:15:30.800
it contained chests filled with tens of thousands of gold coins,

285
00:15:30.801 --> 00:15:34.700
which represented the entire hole from the ships trading expedition,

286
00:15:35.030 --> 00:15:38.270
Bellamy transferred all the cargo from the salt Arno to the widow.

287
00:15:38.420 --> 00:15:42.620
Also adding 10 cannons to the 18 already presence even allowed Princeton is

288
00:15:42.621 --> 00:15:45.200
meant to keep the sole Taner tolerance at sail England.

289
00:15:45.350 --> 00:15:49.280
Although this was mainly because Bellmead didn't have the crew to fully Nan

290
00:15:49.290 --> 00:15:50.123
three ships.

291
00:15:56.320 --> 00:15:56.530
<v 1>[Inaudible].</v>

292
00:15:56.530 --> 00:15:56.980
<v 0>At this point,</v>

293
00:15:56.980 --> 00:16:00.790
black Sam Bellamy was captain of one of the most powerful ships on the sea whose

294
00:16:01.390 --> 00:16:02.770
cargo hold was filled with treasure.

295
00:16:02.920 --> 00:16:05.710
It may have been a smart move to get out while he was on top.

296
00:16:05.711 --> 00:16:07.300
But the temptation for further riches,

297
00:16:07.301 --> 00:16:11.500
fame and glory was just too much after talking it over with the crew.

298
00:16:11.860 --> 00:16:14.920
Bellamy decided to, to travel to the Eastern coast of North America,

299
00:16:15.160 --> 00:16:18.730
starting from New York and going down to the Carolinas,

300
00:16:18.790 --> 00:16:21.040
the pirates took several prizes. During this time.

301
00:16:21.100 --> 00:16:22.750
One of them was the Ann galley,

302
00:16:22.751 --> 00:16:25.720
which she added to his fleet under the command of his quartermaster.

303
00:16:25.721 --> 00:16:29.860
Richard Nolans another was a sleep commanded by captain beer or beers,

304
00:16:29.890 --> 00:16:33.010
but let me wants it to return commands of the plunder ship to the captain.

305
00:16:33.011 --> 00:16:37.150
But his crew out voted him in favor of sinking it out of spice because they

306
00:16:37.180 --> 00:16:38.200
refuse to join them.

307
00:16:38.230 --> 00:16:41.890
This inspired a speech where Bellamy espoused his hatred of the rich English

308
00:16:41.891 --> 00:16:45.730
aristocracy. We have no idea if there is any historical accuracy to it,

309
00:16:45.731 --> 00:16:47.530
but it represents a memorable moments.

310
00:16:47.531 --> 00:16:51.250
Nonetheless Bellamy saying to Bayer though, you are a sneaking puppy.

311
00:16:51.251 --> 00:16:54.640
And so will all those who will submit to be governed by laws,

312
00:16:54.641 --> 00:16:58.450
which rich men have made for their own security for the cowardly wild stuff,

313
00:16:58.570 --> 00:17:02.290
not to the courage otherwise to defend once they get by neighbory,

314
00:17:02.320 --> 00:17:06.610
but you altogether Dan them for a pack of crafty Rascals,

315
00:17:06.611 --> 00:17:11.320
and you who serve them for a parcel of hen hot at numbskulls.

316
00:17:11.500 --> 00:17:15.280
They vilify us the scoundrels do when there is only this difference.

317
00:17:15.281 --> 00:17:18.790
They robbed the poor under the cover of law for sooth.

318
00:17:18.880 --> 00:17:22.030
And we plunge the rich under the protection of our own courage.

319
00:17:22.240 --> 00:17:23.140
How do you not about a MIGS?

320
00:17:23.141 --> 00:17:28.090
Then one of us then sneak off to these villains for employments Bellamy's Korea

321
00:17:28.180 --> 00:17:32.650
and his life. For that matter ended abruptly, unexpectedly and violently,

322
00:17:32.890 --> 00:17:33.551
and April 17,

323
00:17:33.551 --> 00:17:38.500
17 poles grave Williams made a stop to visit his family and probably share some

324
00:17:38.501 --> 00:17:41.920
of his plumbed up during that time, the way to galley headed for new England,

325
00:17:42.040 --> 00:17:45.160
according to legends, Bellamy intended to see his love and Mary Hallis.

326
00:17:45.161 --> 00:17:49.920
But we don't know if this is true either way. He did not make it on the 26th.

327
00:17:49.950 --> 00:17:52.500
The ship was caught in a powerful storm near what is today,

328
00:17:53.150 --> 00:17:54.120
Wellfleet Massachusetts,

329
00:17:54.150 --> 00:17:57.810
the Moss broke and the way to galley and to shallow waters where it capsized and

330
00:17:57.811 --> 00:18:01.920
sank quickly only two men of the 146 on board. The ship survived.

331
00:18:02.070 --> 00:18:05.700
Samuel Bellamy was not one of them around a hundred bodies washed up on the

332
00:18:05.701 --> 00:18:07.440
shore and were buried in a mass grave.

333
00:18:07.590 --> 00:18:11.460
But 40 of them remained unaccounted for people flocked to the beaches near the

334
00:18:11.780 --> 00:18:15.570
rack, his coins, jewels and other valuables were brought in by the tides.

335
00:18:15.720 --> 00:18:15.961
However,

336
00:18:15.961 --> 00:18:19.950
the location of the ship wreck itself remained a mystery for almost 270 years.

337
00:18:20.010 --> 00:18:21.540
It wasn't until 1994,

338
00:18:21.541 --> 00:18:25.410
that maritime archeologist Barry Clifford tracked down the remnants of the wit

339
00:18:25.500 --> 00:18:29.010
of galley back then such discoveries from the golden age of piracy were still

340
00:18:29.100 --> 00:18:31.680
almost unheard of the following year covered in his team,

341
00:18:31.681 --> 00:18:35.340
recovered the ship's bell, which had the words, the word, a galley, 17,

342
00:18:35.341 --> 00:18:36.900
16 inscribed on us,

343
00:18:36.990 --> 00:18:41.130
thus proven conclusively that the wreck was once the flagship of black Sam

344
00:18:41.160 --> 00:18:42.240
Bellamy, we were got a gallery.

345
00:18:42.300 --> 00:18:46.260
It became the first step of pirate shipwreck authenticated beyond any doubt in

346
00:18:46.261 --> 00:18:49.650
the decades that followed over 200,000 individual items have been recovered from

347
00:18:49.651 --> 00:18:53.040
the wreck. This included lots of treasures, such as gold coins,

348
00:18:53.041 --> 00:18:57.450
but archeologists were more interested in the personal items that revealed to us

349
00:18:57.451 --> 00:19:01.040
new notions about the pirates in the golden age. For example,

350
00:19:01.170 --> 00:19:03.120
it had been reported that among Bellamy's crew,

351
00:19:03.360 --> 00:19:04.950
there was a young boy named John King,

352
00:19:04.951 --> 00:19:08.790
who was only 10 or 11 years old in the rank of divers recovered the shoe silk

353
00:19:08.791 --> 00:19:09.241
stocking,

354
00:19:09.241 --> 00:19:13.890
and most disturbing of all the leg bone of a boy that age seemingly proving not

355
00:19:13.891 --> 00:19:17.880
only that John King existed, but that he perished alongside all the others.

356
00:19:18.060 --> 00:19:21.540
As far as Bellamy himself is concerned, his remains still allude us.

357
00:19:21.570 --> 00:19:23.700
His body was not among those that washed ashore.

358
00:19:23.701 --> 00:19:27.300
And it was believed back in 2018 that divers may have found his bones in the

359
00:19:27.301 --> 00:19:31.620
wreckage alas, a DNA sample was compared against that of living descendants.

360
00:19:31.621 --> 00:19:33.870
And it was not a match lack. Sam Bellamy,

361
00:19:34.080 --> 00:19:38.220
still arrests somewhere in Davy Jones' locker to this very day.

362
00:19:38.760 --> 00:19:41.400
So I really hope you found that video. Interesting. If you did,

363
00:19:41.401 --> 00:19:44.820
please do hit that thumbs up button. Also, please do check of another channel.

364
00:19:44.821 --> 00:19:45.990
I mentioned business plays,

365
00:19:45.991 --> 00:19:49.110
which I will link to below and thank you for watching.
