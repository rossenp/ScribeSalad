6
00:00:24.460 --> 00:00:26.630
According to legend Sparta's wife,

7
00:00:26.631 --> 00:00:30.470
once walked in on a sleeping husband to find a snake who wrapped itself around

8
00:00:30.471 --> 00:00:34.030
his face, instead of being alarmed, she took this as a prophecy,

9
00:00:34.060 --> 00:00:37.670
just like the serpent surrounded itself around the warriors head. No,

10
00:00:37.671 --> 00:00:41.900
shall sparas be enveloped by a great fearful power.

11
00:00:42.240 --> 00:00:43.980
One thing the woman could not see, however,

12
00:00:44.240 --> 00:00:48.820
was if this power would lead her husband to glory or disaster

13
00:00:49.240 --> 00:00:52.060
in the end, you will have to decide for yourself what the outcome was.

14
00:00:52.430 --> 00:00:54.500
Spars might have lost the war. Sure,

15
00:00:54.520 --> 00:00:59.220
but NOFOR making the all powerful Roman Republic tremble at his

16
00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:03.290
feet at a time when the might of Rome was continuously expanding all over the

17
00:01:03.291 --> 00:01:07.450
Mediterranean AIS slave led an uprising. The likes of which had never been seen.

18
00:01:07.750 --> 00:01:11.930
He defeated wave after wave of Roman armies and looked for a while.

19
00:01:11.990 --> 00:01:15.130
At least powerful enough to March on Rome itself,

20
00:01:15.430 --> 00:01:18.170
his actions turned sparas into much more than a warrior.

21
00:01:18.470 --> 00:01:21.850
He became a symbol in the fight against oppression, a symbol,

22
00:01:22.040 --> 00:01:25.960
which is still pervasive today. Over 2000 years later,

23
00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:29.760
they say that history is written by the victors. So in that case,

24
00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:32.760
sparas Roman was indeed one of glory.

25
00:01:32.780 --> 00:01:37.200
Nobody mentions the success of crass in putting down a slave uprising.

26
00:01:37.390 --> 00:01:41.400
Instead they talk about the triumph and the bravery of sparas

27
00:01:47.690 --> 00:01:51.950
Unsurprisingly details are scarce regarding sparas life before he rose up and

28
00:01:51.951 --> 00:01:53.950
became the bane of Rome. Even the particulars,

29
00:01:53.951 --> 00:01:57.750
we do know can't be taken for granted because different ancient sources give

30
00:01:57.751 --> 00:01:58.750
varying accounts.

31
00:01:59.190 --> 00:02:04.060
Everyone seems to agree that sparas was a Thra born sometime around the 111

32
00:02:04.440 --> 00:02:08.580
BCE Pluto, a one of the main sources for the war of sparas as he called it,

33
00:02:08.860 --> 00:02:12.220
referred to the warrior as having nomadic stock and described him as being

34
00:02:12.620 --> 00:02:16.900
sagacious and culturally superior, practically more Len than tation.

35
00:02:17.050 --> 00:02:21.260
Some modern scholars have speculated that the word nomadic was a mistranslation

36
00:02:21.261 --> 00:02:22.040
made later.

37
00:02:22.040 --> 00:02:26.570
And that Pluto a actually referred to sparas as being of made eye stark.

38
00:02:26.830 --> 00:02:30.690
The Mady were aeration tribe from those times, which existed in modern day,

39
00:02:30.730 --> 00:02:31.291
Bulgaria,

40
00:02:31.291 --> 00:02:35.090
eventually Spartacus ended up fighting in the Roman army as an auxiliary unit.

41
00:02:35.270 --> 00:02:35.990
At one point,

42
00:02:35.990 --> 00:02:39.930
the Thon earns the scorn of the Romans who captured him and sold himm into

43
00:02:39.931 --> 00:02:40.890
slavery. Again,

44
00:02:41.250 --> 00:02:46.240
sources vary as to the reason why some say that deserted others say that

45
00:02:46.241 --> 00:02:49.440
he led rating parties, or perhaps it was just both

46
00:02:55.850 --> 00:02:59.240
As a slave. Sparas called the eye of one Len batty artist,

47
00:02:59.730 --> 00:03:03.440
Roman who owned a gladiator school called a LUS in Kawa.

48
00:03:03.740 --> 00:03:06.160
He was always on the lookout for strong goals.

49
00:03:06.500 --> 00:03:10.320
Andras who could shed some blood for the pleasure of the crowd in the arena.

50
00:03:10.620 --> 00:03:14.280
Sparas took on the role of a heavyweight gladiator called a Mami.

51
00:03:14.700 --> 00:03:18.040
The look of this warrior is a Hollywood favorite and will be familiar to anyone

52
00:03:18.041 --> 00:03:19.870
who see in gladiators in movies,

53
00:03:20.130 --> 00:03:24.750
the Manila wore a full bronze helmet and a heavy arm leg and shoulder guards.

54
00:03:24.751 --> 00:03:26.310
However, he kept his chest bare,

55
00:03:26.311 --> 00:03:29.830
which often allowed warriors to display the tattoos or battle scars.

56
00:03:30.030 --> 00:03:30.863
They had accrued over the years,

57
00:03:31.050 --> 00:03:34.510
the gladiator often wielded a large shield and straight broad sort.

58
00:03:34.870 --> 00:03:39.300
Although sparas has always been depicted in movies and TV shows as ad just

59
00:03:39.301 --> 00:03:43.060
fighter. We actually do not know anything about his success in the arena.

60
00:03:43.190 --> 00:03:45.620
Since these battles are usually to the death,

61
00:03:45.621 --> 00:03:50.020
he was presumably skilled enough to survive until the uprising started either

62
00:03:50.021 --> 00:03:52.980
that or he was entertaining enough to convince the crowd, to spare him.

63
00:03:53.050 --> 00:03:53.900
Even if he lost

64
00:04:00.390 --> 00:04:05.250
In the year 73 BCE sparas was part of a plot to escape batty artists'

65
00:04:05.251 --> 00:04:06.170
gladiator school.

66
00:04:06.230 --> 00:04:10.490
The number differs Pluto talk says 78 slaves armed themselves with utensils from

67
00:04:10.491 --> 00:04:13.690
the kitchen, defeated the guards and made a run for it. During their escape,

68
00:04:13.691 --> 00:04:16.730
they ran into carts full of gladiator weapons being sent to another city.

69
00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:19.730
They plundered the wagons and armed themselves properly.

70
00:04:20.040 --> 00:04:23.040
The former slaves decided to seek refuge on Mount fus,

71
00:04:23.041 --> 00:04:26.160
which offered a stronger defensive position on their way there.

72
00:04:26.161 --> 00:04:27.400
They recruited other slaves,

73
00:04:27.401 --> 00:04:30.760
as well as Freeman who wanted to join their course ancient sources.

74
00:04:30.950 --> 00:04:34.560
They never really made it clear what exactly sparas did or said to the other

75
00:04:34.580 --> 00:04:38.040
slaves to convince them that he should be their leader. One fact,

76
00:04:38.041 --> 00:04:42.270
which certainly played a part was the fact that the men split all their punter

77
00:04:42.271 --> 00:04:43.790
equally, but it should be mentioned.

78
00:04:43.791 --> 00:04:48.670
The historians also named two go Crysis and mouses leaders of the revolts.

79
00:04:48.720 --> 00:04:53.430
While some describe them as being equals of sparas others like Appian refer to

80
00:04:53.431 --> 00:04:54.710
them as subordinate offices.

81
00:05:01.200 --> 00:05:04.540
It is fair to say when the Roman center heard about sparas in his little

82
00:05:04.541 --> 00:05:08.980
uprising, that they didn't take it too seriously. We may mock them for it now,

83
00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:10.980
but back then, this made a lot of sense.

84
00:05:11.250 --> 00:05:14.580
Rome had quite a few problems on its hands that required its attention.

85
00:05:14.800 --> 00:05:18.300
And more importantly, its soldiers in the Iberian peninsula,

86
00:05:18.370 --> 00:05:22.810
Rome was engaged in the Satan war against Quinta sat say former Roman

87
00:05:22.840 --> 00:05:26.570
statesman who chose the losing side during the seconds of a war of the Roman

88
00:05:26.890 --> 00:05:27.190
Republic,

89
00:05:27.190 --> 00:05:31.490
but refused to concede defeat over an Asia minor ring was fighting the third

90
00:05:31.730 --> 00:05:35.570
myth redic war against the kingdom of Ponta led by myth. Ruti the sixth.

91
00:05:35.760 --> 00:05:39.650
This eventually resulted in a decisive victory for Roman the end of the pontic

92
00:05:40.090 --> 00:05:45.040
Ambar, but not until 10 years of vicious battles. As you can see,

93
00:05:45.230 --> 00:05:47.000
Rome suddenly had its playful.

94
00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:50.440
Therefore the revolt of gladiators was dismissed as nothing more than a crime

95
00:05:50.441 --> 00:05:55.360
wave that could be solved with a cohort or two in charge of this force was a pre

96
00:05:55.490 --> 00:05:59.720
named GAAS Claudias gliber of whom we know almost nothing.

97
00:05:59.900 --> 00:06:03.360
His name suggests he could have had some kind of distant connection with the

98
00:06:03.361 --> 00:06:04.800
influential cloudy family,

99
00:06:04.980 --> 00:06:09.720
but really his only appearance in the historical record is his battle against

100
00:06:10.020 --> 00:06:11.840
sparas. He has never mentioned again,

101
00:06:11.841 --> 00:06:15.360
whether this means he died in battle or he never did anything else of notes.

102
00:06:15.420 --> 00:06:19.950
We simply don't. No. Anyway, LAR army consisted of approximately 3000 militia,

103
00:06:20.130 --> 00:06:22.110
not proper Roman legionaries again,

104
00:06:22.130 --> 00:06:25.790
the fact that the Senate sent an unproven military commander leading untrained

105
00:06:25.791 --> 00:06:29.990
militia revealed how little they were concerned about the uprising Laers units.

106
00:06:30.020 --> 00:06:33.710
They chased the Gators to their camp on Mount for Seus and laid seeds.

107
00:06:33.711 --> 00:06:36.750
On the only road down the mountain, his plan was simply to,

108
00:06:37.020 --> 00:06:40.500
for the insurgents to staff to death, it seemed like a fine strategy.

109
00:06:40.980 --> 00:06:44.540
Albeit a tad on original sparas did not have this problem. In fact,

110
00:06:44.600 --> 00:06:47.180
his side developed a much more novel game plan.

111
00:06:47.320 --> 00:06:51.020
He knew that Glover was only paying attention to the side with the dissent

112
00:06:51.021 --> 00:06:53.460
because all the others consisted of steep cliffs,

113
00:06:53.461 --> 00:06:55.620
which were seemingly impossible. However,

114
00:06:55.920 --> 00:06:59.850
he and his men made rope ladders out of wild vines that were plentiful in the

115
00:06:59.851 --> 00:07:02.410
area and repelled down undetected by the Romans.

116
00:07:02.411 --> 00:07:06.250
They then surrounded Glovers camp and easily defeated his forces by surprise

117
00:07:06.251 --> 00:07:07.290
attack. In the end,

118
00:07:07.350 --> 00:07:11.330
all this expedition managed to do was supply the rebels with better weapons and

119
00:07:11.380 --> 00:07:15.610
armor and help bolster their numbers. As more people heard of their exploits

120
00:07:21.820 --> 00:07:22.760
On the second attempt,

121
00:07:23.200 --> 00:07:27.360
Romes end another trait named either Publius ver or Publius hilarious.

122
00:07:27.610 --> 00:07:30.520
There are no GC details to share regarding these fights.

123
00:07:30.521 --> 00:07:32.760
Just the fact that sparas and his men tramped. Again,

124
00:07:32.810 --> 00:07:35.360
first they defeated one of the protesters left tens named furious,

125
00:07:35.620 --> 00:07:38.120
who also had 2000 soldiers with him.

126
00:07:38.550 --> 00:07:42.430
Another Pretor called who had been sent out with another large force to offer

127
00:07:42.431 --> 00:07:43.470
support to vers.

128
00:07:43.570 --> 00:07:47.150
He was almost taken prisoner by the insurgents as the gladiators caught him off

129
00:07:47.151 --> 00:07:49.670
guard while the Pretor was bathing. Lastly,

130
00:07:49.671 --> 00:07:52.310
the rebels defeated ver sent us a symbol of his victory.

131
00:07:52.450 --> 00:07:53.910
Sparas took the Preuss horse.

132
00:07:54.250 --> 00:07:58.230
Now the gladiator army was free to raid the countryside of Italy unopposed as

133
00:07:58.300 --> 00:08:00.940
more and more men from the region swell their racks.

134
00:08:00.941 --> 00:08:04.780
According to Appian sparas as army boasted over 70,000 soldiers,

135
00:08:05.030 --> 00:08:07.420
presumably on mouse died around this time,

136
00:08:07.460 --> 00:08:12.180
possibly in battle as he is no longer mentioned by historians sparas and Crysis

137
00:08:12.280 --> 00:08:15.380
are referred to as the commanders of this rebel army. At this point,

138
00:08:15.520 --> 00:08:18.260
the insurgents reached to possible crossroads in their journey.

139
00:08:18.440 --> 00:08:21.610
One which still divide it both classical and modern scholars.

140
00:08:21.611 --> 00:08:22.444
According to Pluto,

141
00:08:22.530 --> 00:08:26.610
a sparas wanted to traverse the Alps and escape room and territory. In his view,

142
00:08:26.630 --> 00:08:30.010
the thre plan to disbands the army once had secured freedom.

143
00:08:30.011 --> 00:08:33.690
However sparas could not convince his men who were feeling cocky enough,

144
00:08:33.691 --> 00:08:35.130
that they wanted to continue rating.

145
00:08:35.300 --> 00:08:39.930
Other sources claimed that the plan was and always had been to March

146
00:08:40.140 --> 00:08:40.900
on Rome.

147
00:08:40.900 --> 00:08:44.520
The notion that there was some dissension in the ranks regarding their next move

148
00:08:44.540 --> 00:08:46.960
was strengthened by the fact that at one point,

149
00:08:47.020 --> 00:08:49.120
the rebels split into two different armies.

150
00:08:49.340 --> 00:08:54.000
One was led by sparas the other by Crysis whether this division was strategic so

151
00:08:54.001 --> 00:08:57.320
that they could cover more ground, or if it was caused by disagreements,

152
00:08:57.580 --> 00:08:59.960
we cannot say with any certainty now,

153
00:08:59.961 --> 00:09:01.760
just before we get into the rest of today's video,

154
00:09:01.840 --> 00:09:05.920
I do wanna quickly mention today's sponsor who make our videos possible and

155
00:09:05.921 --> 00:09:07.040
that's curiosity stream.

156
00:09:07.480 --> 00:09:10.520
Now I have actually seen a lot of people hitting me up on Twitter and saying how

157
00:09:10.521 --> 00:09:13.520
much they are enjoying curiosity stream, which is excellent. Uh,

158
00:09:13.521 --> 00:09:16.750
if you wanna say hi to me on that platform, I'm at Simon Whistler,

159
00:09:17.230 --> 00:09:18.230
look me up if you want to.

160
00:09:18.250 --> 00:09:20.950
And I think that is just because what we do here at biographics,

161
00:09:20.951 --> 00:09:24.550
I kind of see them as sort of little documentaries and then curiosity stream.

162
00:09:24.551 --> 00:09:26.230
It's very much in line with that. Indeed.

163
00:09:26.231 --> 00:09:30.590
They've got over 2000 documentaries and nonfiction titles from some of the

164
00:09:30.591 --> 00:09:31.790
world's best filmmakers.

165
00:09:32.050 --> 00:09:35.940
Now is I gonna shock you to learn that there's plenty of document is about Rome

166
00:09:36.200 --> 00:09:39.140
on curiosity stream. If you just search Rome in the platform,

167
00:09:39.360 --> 00:09:41.580
you're gonna get a whole lot of interesting options.

168
00:09:41.760 --> 00:09:44.300
Now I've mentioned a series called the butterfly effect before,

169
00:09:44.301 --> 00:09:47.220
which I've really enjoyed. They've got a couple of episodes about Rome,

170
00:09:47.480 --> 00:09:51.380
one about Augustus, and one about Carthage. They're definitely worth a watch.

171
00:09:51.381 --> 00:09:56.170
And you can do all of that. Watching for free for 30 days are link,

172
00:09:56.171 --> 00:10:01.090
curiosity, stream.com/biographics it's also below. And when you are, uh,

173
00:10:01.091 --> 00:10:01.630
checking out,

174
00:10:01.630 --> 00:10:06.210
use the code biographics and that will give you those 30 days for free.

175
00:10:06.380 --> 00:10:09.810
After that it's just $2 99 cents a month, which is just super cheap.

176
00:10:09.880 --> 00:10:11.930
It's super great. Definitely check it out.

177
00:10:11.931 --> 00:10:14.610
It also spots the show and let's go back to sparas.

178
00:10:20.980 --> 00:10:21.580
By this point,

179
00:10:21.580 --> 00:10:25.640
the Senate realized that the little uprising caused by the escaped slaves was no

180
00:10:25.760 --> 00:10:27.840
laughing Madans it was only growing in power.

181
00:10:27.910 --> 00:10:31.720
Some have argued that the Roman leaders were reticent to unleash the true might

182
00:10:31.920 --> 00:10:34.560
of Rome, because it would've been an admittance of defeat.

183
00:10:34.750 --> 00:10:37.270
Just the idea that a few ins slaves,

184
00:10:37.460 --> 00:10:39.710
Germans and go could threat in the Roman public.

185
00:10:39.890 --> 00:10:44.350
It was a bit of an embarrassment, but after a year of the rebels running wilds,

186
00:10:44.351 --> 00:10:48.030
the senators had enough in 72 BC, it tasked two consoles,

187
00:10:48.630 --> 00:10:53.350
Guo and lentils to put an end to the uprising and each one commanded a Roman

188
00:10:53.490 --> 00:10:55.670
Legion, the exact size of Allegion.

189
00:10:55.671 --> 00:10:57.980
It actually varied throughout the degree of Rome. Uh,

190
00:10:57.981 --> 00:10:59.460
according to li during the Republic,

191
00:10:59.480 --> 00:11:02.980
the Senate set the size at the start of the year based on availability and

192
00:11:02.981 --> 00:11:03.814
circumstances.

193
00:11:03.900 --> 00:11:08.060
Although typically Allegion contained around 4,000 infantry and a few hundred

194
00:11:08.250 --> 00:11:12.260
cavalry, it would vary anywhere from 3000 to 6,000 soldiers,

195
00:11:12.310 --> 00:11:14.460
regardless of how many men the legions had.

196
00:11:14.460 --> 00:11:18.290
They were still vastly outnumbered by the insurgent. Four is however,

197
00:11:18.560 --> 00:11:21.370
what they liked in manpower. They more than made up for,

198
00:11:21.371 --> 00:11:25.770
with strict military training and top of the line equipment spar forces on the

199
00:11:25.771 --> 00:11:29.050
other hands, they consisted mostly of peasants, deserters, slaves,

200
00:11:29.070 --> 00:11:29.903
and shepherds.

201
00:11:30.040 --> 00:11:33.690
Very few of them stood a chance against a Roman soldier in combat.

202
00:11:34.190 --> 00:11:39.040
So here we arrive at a bit of a contentious moment because the main source is

203
00:11:39.360 --> 00:11:39.640
Pluto,

204
00:11:39.640 --> 00:11:44.080
tar and Appian give differing accounts on the battles between sparas and the

205
00:11:44.081 --> 00:11:47.480
consular armies. They do not necessarily contradict each other,

206
00:11:47.580 --> 00:11:51.560
but they each mention events that the other ignores, as I said previously,

207
00:11:51.561 --> 00:11:53.640
the rebel forces split into two armies.

208
00:11:53.710 --> 00:11:58.640
Both historians agree that Guo and his Legion fought Crysis who commanded

209
00:11:58.641 --> 00:12:02.560
around 30,000 men. And all of that happens in Mount ganas.

210
00:12:02.750 --> 00:12:05.880
This encounter resulted in a decisive victory for the Romans,

211
00:12:05.900 --> 00:12:09.280
the rebel army lost around two thirds of its troops, including Crysis,

212
00:12:09.281 --> 00:12:12.400
who was killed in battle. When hearing of this Barus alleged,

213
00:12:12.710 --> 00:12:14.950
he sacrificed 300 Roman soldiers in his honor.

214
00:12:21.060 --> 00:12:25.150
Both sources also agree that sparas and the main insurgent force faced the army

215
00:12:25.410 --> 00:12:30.270
of Len while heading for CIS Aine goal and triumph afterwards, however,

216
00:12:30.450 --> 00:12:31.630
the account start to differ.

217
00:12:31.890 --> 00:12:35.300
You have to remember that even in the best sources we have for the war of sparas

218
00:12:35.301 --> 00:12:39.140
wrote their accounts over 150 years after the uprising had taken place,

219
00:12:39.490 --> 00:12:44.020
many details could certainly have been altered or forgotten according to AEN GAO

220
00:12:44.080 --> 00:12:47.420
and his men headed towards Spartacus after defeating Crysis.

221
00:12:47.480 --> 00:12:50.980
His hope was that he would reach the Spartan army in times of trapped between

222
00:12:50.981 --> 00:12:54.090
the two legions commanded by him and lentils. However,

223
00:12:54.510 --> 00:12:58.010
he was too late and the Thon had time to best the other console,

224
00:12:58.450 --> 00:13:01.010
turn his soldiers around and defeat Gaius in combat.

225
00:13:01.350 --> 00:13:04.610
The two consular legions were retreated and regrouped back in Rome,

226
00:13:04.760 --> 00:13:09.170
they then United as a single Armyn made a third attempt against sparas that PCE,

227
00:13:09.890 --> 00:13:10.723
but they were once again,

228
00:13:10.770 --> 00:13:15.040
defeated police arch makes no mention of sparas as fired against Gallia saw the

229
00:13:15.041 --> 00:13:17.880
battle of PI against both consoles. Instead,

230
00:13:17.940 --> 00:13:20.600
he says that after the Thon bested lends,

231
00:13:20.620 --> 00:13:25.320
he engaged in combat with an army of 10,000 men led by GAAS Cassius

232
00:13:25.960 --> 00:13:29.880
longness the governor of CI Alpine go once again, he was victorious.

233
00:13:29.890 --> 00:13:33.520
There is also some confusion regarding what happened after spars defeated the

234
00:13:33.521 --> 00:13:36.630
consular armies, our Pluto tar offers no concrete information,

235
00:13:37.300 --> 00:13:40.030
more or less places sparas on the war path to Rome.

236
00:13:40.160 --> 00:13:44.070
Maybe it was the death of Crysis or maybe he thought himself invincible in

237
00:13:44.071 --> 00:13:47.670
battle, but sparas seemed determined to pillage mighty Rome itself.

238
00:13:47.890 --> 00:13:51.510
He killed all his prisoners and his pack animals and set fire to any useless

239
00:13:51.750 --> 00:13:54.310
materials that might have burdened and slowed him down.

240
00:13:54.370 --> 00:13:58.060
He marched capital with an army of 120,000 footmen.

241
00:13:58.210 --> 00:13:59.660
Despite his gungho attitude,

242
00:13:59.870 --> 00:14:03.300
spars had a change of heart on the way and realized that perhaps his army was

243
00:14:03.301 --> 00:14:04.660
not strong enough just yet.

244
00:14:04.930 --> 00:14:08.780
Instead he took over the city of Thiry and the surrounding mountains and

245
00:14:08.781 --> 00:14:12.660
conducted raids for bronze and irons to forge weapons and equip its troops.

246
00:14:19.070 --> 00:14:22.690
The Senate drops any pretense that the Spartan rebellion was anything else than

247
00:14:22.691 --> 00:14:25.170
a major threat that's endangered the Republic itself.

248
00:14:25.350 --> 00:14:29.570
He gave the task of putting down the uprising once and for all to Marcus lain

249
00:14:30.290 --> 00:14:34.610
crass CRAs is primarily remember today for allegedly being the richest man in

250
00:14:34.611 --> 00:14:38.360
Roman history. The true extent wealth is impossible to gauge with accuracy,

251
00:14:38.460 --> 00:14:41.440
but it could have been up to 20 billion in modern currency.

252
00:14:41.660 --> 00:14:44.520
The number most commonly used is 200 million SU stur.

253
00:14:44.920 --> 00:14:46.400
An estimation provided by plenty.

254
00:14:46.800 --> 00:14:50.280
Please aren't used gold talents to quantify crashes as wealth and placed it at

255
00:14:50.281 --> 00:14:53.400
over 7,100 talents, which would mean in modern times,

256
00:14:53.410 --> 00:14:55.720
about 213 metric,

257
00:14:55.910 --> 00:14:59.160
tons of gold grasses as fortune came from fire and war,

258
00:14:59.161 --> 00:15:00.680
making the public calamities,

259
00:15:00.920 --> 00:15:03.000
his greatest source of revenue as Pluto tar put it.

260
00:15:03.070 --> 00:15:05.640
Some of his lucrative businesses included a fire department.

261
00:15:05.641 --> 00:15:08.520
That's arrived to burning home and only extinguished the flames.

262
00:15:08.520 --> 00:15:11.430
If it's negotiated a generous bargain with the owner,

263
00:15:11.500 --> 00:15:14.590
otherwise the men simply looked on as the home burn to the ground.

264
00:15:14.680 --> 00:15:18.550
Afterwards crass even offered to buy the property at a significantly reduced

265
00:15:18.600 --> 00:15:19.433
price. Of course,

266
00:15:19.460 --> 00:15:23.430
another one of his schemes was a school for slaves by taking cheap unskilled

267
00:15:23.431 --> 00:15:24.590
labor and giving them training.

268
00:15:24.650 --> 00:15:28.190
He increased their value significantly and then sold them for a tiny profit,

269
00:15:28.490 --> 00:15:31.420
the bulk of crass as well. However, came from really estate.

270
00:15:31.780 --> 00:15:32.780
He was an ally of Soula,

271
00:15:32.781 --> 00:15:36.780
the Roman general who prompted a civil war that involved the AF mentioned Quinta

272
00:15:37.260 --> 00:15:40.260
histor after his triumph Soula enacted prescriptions,

273
00:15:40.261 --> 00:15:44.220
meaning that all of his powerful enemies were either put to death or banished.

274
00:15:44.240 --> 00:15:46.900
And then the possessions were confiscated and put up for auction.

275
00:15:47.050 --> 00:15:50.580
This allowed crashes to purchase massive amounts of lands in property for next

276
00:15:50.820 --> 00:15:53.410
to nothing go him outta the war. Crass was not only rich,

277
00:15:53.470 --> 00:15:55.530
but also had high political aspirations.

278
00:15:55.870 --> 00:15:59.130
He knew that putting down the rebellion would secure his position in the Senate.

279
00:15:59.470 --> 00:16:02.370
He used his own money to equip and train new troops.

280
00:16:02.430 --> 00:16:07.050
He was made a Pretor and was granted command of six new legions plus what was

281
00:16:07.051 --> 00:16:08.690
left of the two consular armies.

282
00:16:09.210 --> 00:16:12.560
But first it looked like this military expedition would ends call the others

283
00:16:12.730 --> 00:16:16.520
while crasus in the bulk of his army, waited for sparas on the borders of PCE.

284
00:16:16.740 --> 00:16:21.320
He sent his Lego mumus with two legions to circle around and approach the

285
00:16:21.321 --> 00:16:25.000
rebellion army from behind Crassus gave explicit orders not to attack the

286
00:16:25.001 --> 00:16:27.760
insurgent. So even to engage in skirmishes,

287
00:16:28.050 --> 00:16:31.080
mumus disobeyed feeling like he had an advantageous position.

288
00:16:31.580 --> 00:16:35.870
He attacked and he lost clearly crisises needed to teach some discipline,

289
00:16:35.871 --> 00:16:38.230
something he accomplished with an extreme measure.

290
00:16:38.530 --> 00:16:41.670
He revived a punishment that had not been used for almost 200 years.

291
00:16:42.090 --> 00:16:46.430
And that was decimation. The soldiers were divided into decades, decade here,

292
00:16:46.431 --> 00:16:47.710
simply meaning a group of 10.

293
00:16:47.740 --> 00:16:52.350
They drew lots and the losing soldier from every decade was executed. Again,

294
00:16:52.351 --> 00:16:56.420
there is a bit of dis agreements over who CRA decimated exactly due a,

295
00:16:56.720 --> 00:17:00.380
it was only one cohort of his 500 or so soldiers AIAN, however,

296
00:17:00.420 --> 00:17:04.260
believed it was either the two consular legions or his entire army.

297
00:17:04.530 --> 00:17:07.300
This is a pretty big detail because it makes the difference between the

298
00:17:07.301 --> 00:17:11.340
execution of 50 soldiers. More or less in the execution of thousands,

299
00:17:11.480 --> 00:17:12.101
either way,

300
00:17:12.101 --> 00:17:16.410
the tactics seemed to work and crass showed his men that he was more dangerous

301
00:17:16.411 --> 00:17:17.244
than the enemy

302
00:17:24.050 --> 00:17:26.850
Crisis' methods might have been harsh, but the yielded results,

303
00:17:26.950 --> 00:17:30.210
the following times that armies met him, battle Romans were victorious.

304
00:17:30.510 --> 00:17:32.890
Sparas was forced to retreat to a region in Southern,

305
00:17:32.891 --> 00:17:37.040
near league called blue talk reports that the Thra plan to take over the island

306
00:17:37.140 --> 00:17:39.120
of Sicily and regroup that for this,

307
00:17:39.320 --> 00:17:42.520
he negotiated passage with a group of CIC pirates. However,

308
00:17:42.630 --> 00:17:44.040
with pirates being pirates,

309
00:17:44.041 --> 00:17:47.920
they double crossed him and sailed away after being paid spar had back against

310
00:17:47.921 --> 00:17:50.520
the wall. So we fell back to the peninsula of regime.

311
00:17:51.360 --> 00:17:53.400
Cassius felt that he had victory in his grasp,

312
00:17:53.580 --> 00:17:56.080
but he was wise enough to not underestimate the Thra.

313
00:17:56.300 --> 00:17:58.920
As many had done before him, instead of forcing a battle,

314
00:17:59.020 --> 00:18:02.480
he built fortifications across the air Smiths to the peninsula so that the

315
00:18:02.481 --> 00:18:04.880
rebels would be cut off from many provisions. Indeed,

316
00:18:04.881 --> 00:18:07.320
this tactic split the rebellious fighters into two groups.

317
00:18:07.500 --> 00:18:10.270
One of them broke through the siege and started their own rating.

318
00:18:10.630 --> 00:18:13.590
Campaign crashes fell upon them swiftly and destroyed men battle,

319
00:18:13.730 --> 00:18:16.870
but he was disheartened to see that their fighting spirit had not been

320
00:18:16.871 --> 00:18:20.550
extinguished. Although he killed over 12,000 insurgents upon inspection,

321
00:18:20.860 --> 00:18:22.950
only two of them had wounds in their backs.

322
00:18:23.130 --> 00:18:27.390
All of the others had died facing the enemy fighting until their last breath.

323
00:18:27.660 --> 00:18:28.493
Meanwhile,

324
00:18:28.510 --> 00:18:32.780
CRA sent other army led by one of his officer Quinters to pursue the Spartan

325
00:18:32.781 --> 00:18:34.460
forces, which fled to the mountains.

326
00:18:34.680 --> 00:18:38.380
The gladiator turned his troops around and met the Romans in battle and was

327
00:18:38.381 --> 00:18:40.540
triumphant bolstered by the recent victory.

328
00:18:40.541 --> 00:18:43.180
The rebels wanted to take on the main army of Craus

329
00:18:49.630 --> 00:18:52.970
One final decisive battle suited CRAs just fine.

330
00:18:53.410 --> 00:18:56.850
Although at first he seemed content with weakening the insurgents as much as

331
00:18:57.050 --> 00:18:57.510
possible.

332
00:18:57.510 --> 00:19:00.930
Now he was fighting against the clock as he received news that the Roman

333
00:19:01.210 --> 00:19:03.210
reinforcement were on their way Poe the grave.

334
00:19:03.370 --> 00:19:06.850
He managed to put down a rebellion in the Iberian peninsula and had redirected

335
00:19:06.851 --> 00:19:08.570
his forces to take on Spartacus.

336
00:19:08.970 --> 00:19:12.360
Other commands and named was also coming with additional soldiers.

337
00:19:12.460 --> 00:19:15.640
You would think that the arrival of reinforcement would be good news for crass,

338
00:19:15.660 --> 00:19:19.440
but he had no intention of sharing credit with anyone for putting down the

339
00:19:19.441 --> 00:19:23.080
largest rebellion in Roman history before making his last stand Spartak has

340
00:19:23.240 --> 00:19:25.000
actually tried to call Arus with crass,

341
00:19:25.001 --> 00:19:28.840
but the Roman PR rejected it categorically to fill his ambitions,

342
00:19:28.870 --> 00:19:32.630
nothing but the absolute iteration of the revolt would've suffice.

343
00:19:32.970 --> 00:19:37.390
The Army's met the battle of St river. This Baran troop sport hard,

344
00:19:37.710 --> 00:19:42.230
but was soundly defeated around 36,000 of them died in battle around 6,000 more

345
00:19:42.231 --> 00:19:47.070
were taken prisoner by CRAs and were crucified along the Appian way about 5,000

346
00:19:47.071 --> 00:19:48.390
rebels managed to flee the battle.

347
00:19:48.830 --> 00:19:51.260
But they were met by Pompe who cut them to P pieces.

348
00:19:51.830 --> 00:19:54.100
Pompe told Rome that even though crasus won the battle,

349
00:19:54.280 --> 00:19:57.980
he extricated the war accordingly for this and his victory in his Spania.

350
00:19:57.981 --> 00:20:01.500
He was given a major triumph upon his return and he was made consult.

351
00:20:01.800 --> 00:20:03.300
In this case, a triumph is a Roman ritual,

352
00:20:03.350 --> 00:20:07.900
which celebrates general successes in battle crass was later made AEN with

353
00:20:08.070 --> 00:20:11.930
Pompe support. He also won over the masses of Rome by abusing his money,

354
00:20:11.950 --> 00:20:15.730
to throw a giant feast in honor of Hercules and paying for everyone's grain

355
00:20:15.731 --> 00:20:16.770
allowance for three months,

356
00:20:17.070 --> 00:20:20.210
the two of them later formed an informal Alliance called the first Trive

357
00:20:20.360 --> 00:20:23.130
alongside another Roman up and CU named Julius Caesar.

358
00:20:29.520 --> 00:20:33.100
It would be nice if we could have ended with one final anecdote about sparas

359
00:20:33.101 --> 00:20:35.970
since this bio is about him. Unfortunately,

360
00:20:36.160 --> 00:20:38.130
history is seldom Matt accommodating.

361
00:20:38.230 --> 00:20:42.810
He died in battle killed at an unknown time by an unknown soldier and his body

362
00:20:42.811 --> 00:20:46.330
was never recovered, even though he had no possible way of knowing this Pluto,

363
00:20:46.450 --> 00:20:47.283
a thoughts,

364
00:20:47.640 --> 00:20:51.000
a more fitting end for the thro who tried to bring Rome to his knees.

365
00:20:51.100 --> 00:20:54.920
He claimed that during battle sparas cut his way through the enemy ranks and

366
00:20:55.050 --> 00:20:56.680
tried to reach crashes himself,

367
00:20:57.000 --> 00:20:59.880
but was starved when two dead centurions fell upon him,

368
00:21:00.100 --> 00:21:04.200
he was then completely surrounded and cut down while fighting to the bitter end.

369
00:21:04.660 --> 00:21:07.350
