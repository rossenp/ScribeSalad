00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:00.960
<v 0>During world war two,</v>

2
00:00:00.990 --> 00:00:04.740
there were a lot of American generals and admirals who commanded combat forces.

3
00:00:04.860 --> 00:00:07.530
They can be roughly divided into two categories,

4
00:00:07.590 --> 00:00:11.670
strategic commanders like Dwight Eisenhower or Chester Nimitz viewed the big

5
00:00:11.700 --> 00:00:15.780
picture of the war, guiding strategy, mastering logistical problems,

6
00:00:15.781 --> 00:00:19.140
and installing the right people in the right places to get the job done.

7
00:00:19.170 --> 00:00:21.960
Tactical commanders by contrast had a more limited focus.

8
00:00:22.110 --> 00:00:26.160
They were frontline battlefield officers often exposing themselves to great

9
00:00:26.161 --> 00:00:28.650
physical danger in order to accomplish their mission.

10
00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:32.670
No officer in the United States better typifies the tactical commanders and

11
00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:34.800
Admiral William Halsey in the dark days,

12
00:00:34.801 --> 00:00:39.030
following Pearl Harbor Holsey commanded the greatest part of what was left of

13
00:00:39.031 --> 00:00:42.780
the shattered Pacific fleet. Having commands of an aircraft carrier task force.

14
00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:46.770
He sought to use this force to bring the war to the Japanese. However he could,

15
00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:48.030
whenever he could,

16
00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:51.630
the standing order was always attack and hit them harder than they can hedge you

17
00:00:51.810 --> 00:00:56.010
throughout the duration of the Pacific war Halsey was in the front lines of many

18
00:00:56.011 --> 00:00:59.640
of the major battles and his inspirational leadership and courage made him a

19
00:00:59.641 --> 00:01:03.600
hero to his sailors and to the civilian population. It wasn't perfect.

20
00:01:03.770 --> 00:01:06.630
You made several key mistakes that might've costed more.

21
00:01:06.631 --> 00:01:08.130
Had he been a less famous commander,

22
00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:12.150
but his contributions to the victory of the United States over Japan were also

23
00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:14.100
obvious to everyone who worked with him.

24
00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:16.470
And he was rewarded for his service with the ranks,

25
00:01:16.480 --> 00:01:20.550
that to date only three other officers in the U S Navy have achieved.

26
00:01:32.810 --> 00:01:35.930
William Frederick Halsey Jr. Was born on October the 30th,

27
00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:39.740
1882 in Elizabeth New Jersey, a large suburb of New York city.

28
00:01:39.800 --> 00:01:41.750
The Navy was in his blood from the start.

29
00:01:41.751 --> 00:01:45.890
His father William Senio was a captain in the United States Navy and an

30
00:01:45.891 --> 00:01:46.551
ancestor.

31
00:01:46.551 --> 00:01:50.330
A captain John Halsey served in the Royal Navy in the American theater of the

32
00:01:50.331 --> 00:01:54.050
war of Spanish succession. 1702 to 1713.

33
00:01:54.260 --> 00:01:57.110
Growing up Halsey was destined to become a Naval officer.

34
00:01:57.470 --> 00:01:58.700
He hits a slight snag though,

35
00:01:58.730 --> 00:02:01.730
when he failed two years in a row to secure an appointment to the United States

36
00:02:01.760 --> 00:02:03.350
Naval Academy at Annapolis,

37
00:02:03.500 --> 00:02:07.460
the Academy is where most Naval officers come from and it was where his father

38
00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:10.130
had graduated from. So it must've been a difficult blow.

39
00:02:10.400 --> 00:02:13.730
He decided to study medicine at the university of Virginia runs become a doctor

40
00:02:13.731 --> 00:02:17.240
in the Navy after graduation. However, after his freshman year at Virginia,

41
00:02:17.270 --> 00:02:20.960
he finally received an appointment to Annapolis and D graduated in 1984.

42
00:02:21.290 --> 00:02:24.620
I'll see Rose rapidly through the ranks. And when the first world war broke out,

43
00:02:24.621 --> 00:02:29.000
he was a Lieutenant commander in command of a destroyer USS shore for his

44
00:02:29.001 --> 00:02:32.210
distinguished service throughout the conflict. He was awarded the Navy cross.

45
00:02:32.211 --> 00:02:35.600
The second highest medal of Valor that the Navy awards.

46
00:02:41.570 --> 00:02:42.200
<v 1>[Inaudible].</v>

47
00:02:42.200 --> 00:02:45.230
<v 0>Halsey continued to serve primarily in command of destroyers throughout the</v>

48
00:02:45.231 --> 00:02:47.000
1920s and early 1930s.

49
00:02:47.030 --> 00:02:50.270
But the course of his career changed completely in 1934,

50
00:02:50.271 --> 00:02:54.710
when he was offered commands of the Navy's that aircraft carrier USS Saratoga,

51
00:02:55.040 --> 00:02:58.160
it was only required to complete an observer's course in order to take commands.

52
00:02:58.161 --> 00:03:02.290
But captain Halsey decided to enroll himself in the rigorous Naval aviation

53
00:03:02.320 --> 00:03:06.570
program saying I thought it better to be able to fly the aircraft itself than to

54
00:03:06.571 --> 00:03:11.140
just sit back and be at the mercy of the pilot in 1930 500 seat received as

55
00:03:11.470 --> 00:03:14.470
goals and Naval aviator wings. He was at the age of 52,

56
00:03:14.471 --> 00:03:16.870
the oldest person to do so in the history of the Navy,

57
00:03:17.140 --> 00:03:20.470
he immediately became a leading advocate for the use of air power in Naval

58
00:03:20.471 --> 00:03:24.100
tactics. By 1941, he had been promoted three times device Admiral,

59
00:03:24.280 --> 00:03:27.610
and was the commander of the aircraft battle force of the Pacific fleet

60
00:03:27.790 --> 00:03:31.240
overseeing all three aircraft carriers that the Navy had at pal Harbor.

61
00:03:31.510 --> 00:03:31.991
At the time,

62
00:03:31.991 --> 00:03:35.800
the Pacific fleet was primarily composed of large battleships with heavy guns

63
00:03:35.801 --> 00:03:39.910
and aircraft carriers were considered to be a support ship around 1941.

64
00:03:40.030 --> 00:03:43.360
Tensions with Japan had increased and many felt that war was eminence.

65
00:03:43.450 --> 00:03:47.560
Naval intelligence believed that the small American outpost on wake islands was

66
00:03:47.561 --> 00:03:51.070
going to be a likely target to the Japanese attack in response to this,

67
00:03:51.071 --> 00:03:53.770
the commander of the Pacific fleet and mural Kimmel dispatched,

68
00:03:53.771 --> 00:03:56.140
Halsey aboard USS enterprise to weigh.

69
00:03:56.230 --> 00:04:00.730
He called November the 28th of 1941 to deliver planes to the Marine Garrison

70
00:04:00.731 --> 00:04:02.770
there as reinforcements throughout the journey.

71
00:04:03.160 --> 00:04:07.330
How's he kept a lookout for any Japanese activity intending to attack any forces

72
00:04:07.331 --> 00:04:10.240
that he saw as a threat to his ship, but nothing appeared.

73
00:04:10.420 --> 00:04:13.090
And enterprise started the journey back to Pearl Harbor.

74
00:04:13.210 --> 00:04:15.880
The ship was scheduled to return to port on December the sixth,

75
00:04:15.910 --> 00:04:17.260
but a storm had delayed her,

76
00:04:17.261 --> 00:04:19.240
which means this on the morning of December the seventh,

77
00:04:19.241 --> 00:04:20.860
she was still 200 miles West of us

78
00:04:27.690 --> 00:04:31.650
Confused and desperate, ready, and messages. You told Halsey what was happening.

79
00:04:31.680 --> 00:04:34.200
The Japanese had indeed attacks, but not at wake Island.

80
00:04:34.350 --> 00:04:37.740
They had attacked Pearl Harbor itself in the chaos of that day, come on,

81
00:04:37.741 --> 00:04:41.340
radio Halsey, ordering him to take commands of any and all ships at sea.

82
00:04:41.670 --> 00:04:45.750
The all other ships in the vicinity of Hawaii to rally to the enterprise policy,

83
00:04:45.780 --> 00:04:46.800
deployed his wing,

84
00:04:46.820 --> 00:04:50.460
searching to the South and West of the islands for the Japanese combined fleets

85
00:04:50.461 --> 00:04:52.500
that carried out the Pearl Harbor attack,

86
00:04:52.530 --> 00:04:56.610
but he was unable to locate them as they had retreated to the North Halsey

87
00:04:56.611 --> 00:04:58.050
returns, Pearl Harbor, the next day,

88
00:04:58.051 --> 00:05:01.890
viewing with dismay the damage the attack had done to the Pacific fleet and his

89
00:05:01.891 --> 00:05:04.080
anger. He said before we're through with them,

90
00:05:04.200 --> 00:05:07.590
the Japanese language will be spoken only in hell.

91
00:05:07.740 --> 00:05:11.130
It got Tanika destroyed or heavily damaged all of the large battleships in the

92
00:05:11.131 --> 00:05:13.590
fleet, but Halsey's command was still intact.

93
00:05:13.620 --> 00:05:18.520
USS Saratoga was in San Diego while USS Lexington had departed Pearl Harbor

94
00:05:18.720 --> 00:05:21.630
on December the fifth to bring reinforcements to midway Island.

95
00:05:21.720 --> 00:05:25.380
The carriers were now the only ships the Navy had left in the Pacific to counsel

96
00:05:25.390 --> 00:05:28.920
the Japanese and Halsey intended to use them with approval from the new

97
00:05:28.921 --> 00:05:30.090
commander of the Pacific fleet,

98
00:05:30.091 --> 00:05:34.800
Admiral Nimitz Halsey's ships engaged in his and run raids on Japanese HoloLens,

99
00:05:34.990 --> 00:05:36.720
as the attacks did little lasting damage,

100
00:05:36.750 --> 00:05:40.410
but the American public reeling from a series of defeats didn't cap,

101
00:05:40.560 --> 00:05:43.770
someone was hitting back at the Japanese and that was all the matters.

102
00:05:43.800 --> 00:05:46.110
His sailors who loved the admirals, gruff, demeanor,

103
00:05:46.111 --> 00:05:50.010
and aggressive tactics referred to the raids as holding with Holsey.

104
00:05:50.100 --> 00:05:53.340
It was during this time that Ozzie a quad around their unusual nickname mole,

105
00:05:53.460 --> 00:05:56.760
his life had been known as bill holes. It, you show up for William. However,

106
00:05:56.761 --> 00:06:00.200
in the early months of the war and unknown journalist had accidentally recorded

107
00:06:00.201 --> 00:06:01.910
his name as bull Halsy.

108
00:06:01.970 --> 00:06:05.720
The name actually suited his public persona as he continued to be called this

109
00:06:05.730 --> 00:06:08.240
the remainder of his life though, never to his face.

110
00:06:08.300 --> 00:06:10.700
When he returned to Pearl Harbor. At the end of may, 1942,

111
00:06:10.701 --> 00:06:13.490
Holsey was in poor health, a debilitating skin condition,

112
00:06:13.491 --> 00:06:15.440
which was variously referred to as shingles,

113
00:06:15.441 --> 00:06:19.130
a atopic dermatitis and psoriasis caused a rash to break out over.

114
00:06:19.131 --> 00:06:19.910
Most of his body.

115
00:06:19.910 --> 00:06:23.000
It's believed that the combination of the high stress environments that he had

116
00:06:23.001 --> 00:06:25.310
been in for the last six months combined with his neck,

117
00:06:25.311 --> 00:06:28.850
constant smoking and coffee drinking had aggravated a skin condition.

118
00:06:28.880 --> 00:06:32.180
He had managed for most of his life with creams, unable to sleep,

119
00:06:32.300 --> 00:06:35.750
then having lost 20 pounds Admiral Nimitz sent to order him into a Hawaii

120
00:06:35.751 --> 00:06:36.584
hospital.

121
00:06:42.790 --> 00:06:42.970
<v 1>[Inaudible].</v>

122
00:06:42.970 --> 00:06:46.420
<v 0>Halsey was taken back to the mainland United States for treatments being out of</v>

123
00:06:46.421 --> 00:06:48.430
action until September, 1942.

124
00:06:48.670 --> 00:06:52.210
He had missed the crucial battle of midway that occurred in June in which the

125
00:06:52.211 --> 00:06:56.380
Americans sank for Japanese aircraft carriers and largely neutralized that

126
00:06:56.410 --> 00:06:59.800
offensive capabilities for the remainder of the war hoses recommended

127
00:06:59.801 --> 00:07:00.400
replacement,

128
00:07:00.400 --> 00:07:03.430
Admiral Raymond sprue ants that distinguished himself in that battle.

129
00:07:03.460 --> 00:07:07.720
The first step on his own command journey that the war was ends with parallel

130
00:07:07.721 --> 00:07:09.160
Halsey's in October,

131
00:07:09.580 --> 00:07:13.090
Holsey was sent to the South Pacific theater of a scene of a desperate struggle

132
00:07:13.091 --> 00:07:14.440
on the Island of Guadalcanal.

133
00:07:14.610 --> 00:07:17.470
First Marine division has invaded the islands back in August,

134
00:07:17.500 --> 00:07:18.910
but after the disaster,

135
00:07:19.030 --> 00:07:23.020
as battle of salvo islands had seen four Navy cruisers sung and two admirals

136
00:07:23.021 --> 00:07:26.830
killed the Navy had retreated stranding the Marines on the islands without most

137
00:07:26.831 --> 00:07:28.270
of their supplies in the two months,

138
00:07:28.271 --> 00:07:31.630
since then Naval support had been spotty and inconsistent while the Japanese

139
00:07:31.631 --> 00:07:33.850
continued to pour resources onto the islands,

140
00:07:33.851 --> 00:07:37.720
largely unimpeded Admiral Nimitz had concluded that the Naval commander vice

141
00:07:37.721 --> 00:07:42.130
Admiral Robert Romney was overwhelmed and had lost the will to fight and decided

142
00:07:42.131 --> 00:07:44.170
to relieve him of command, replacing them with wholesale.

143
00:07:44.200 --> 00:07:47.830
He was now in command of all forces in the South Pacific and was determined to

144
00:07:47.831 --> 00:07:51.520
take Guadalcanal at all costs where Gormley had been cautious,

145
00:07:52.060 --> 00:07:55.540
Elsie was aggressive. He wasn't afraid to commit his ships to decisive battles,

146
00:07:55.541 --> 00:07:59.050
to stop the Japanese reinforcement of Guadalcanal and to protect American

147
00:07:59.051 --> 00:08:03.010
reinforcements landing. These tactics paid off by February, 1943.

148
00:08:03.011 --> 00:08:07.000
Guata canal was secured Halsey's forces spent the rest of the year attacking up

149
00:08:07.001 --> 00:08:10.810
the Solomon Islands, Jane in particular Borgonville as part of this campaign,

150
00:08:11.230 --> 00:08:14.590
Hulsey directed a daring early morning raid on the heavily fortified Japanese

151
00:08:14.591 --> 00:08:19.000
port of rabble taking the enemy by surprise and inflicting heavy damage in what

152
00:08:19.001 --> 00:08:22.300
was called the American answer to Pearl Harbor. By the end of 1943,

153
00:08:22.301 --> 00:08:26.140
the South Pacific area was largely in the hands of the allies and Admiral Nimitz

154
00:08:26.350 --> 00:08:27.820
had a new assignment for Jose

155
00:08:34.030 --> 00:08:34.960
In 1944,

156
00:08:34.961 --> 00:08:38.500
Nimitz reorganized the bulk of the Pacific fleet into what became known as the

157
00:08:38.501 --> 00:08:39.670
big blue fleet.

158
00:08:39.730 --> 00:08:43.720
This was to beat the fleet that would attack all the way across the Pacific to

159
00:08:43.721 --> 00:08:47.920
the shores of Japan itself to win the war control of the big blue fleet was to

160
00:08:47.921 --> 00:08:50.560
alternate between Holsey and Admiral Spruance,

161
00:08:51.040 --> 00:08:54.190
Jose's friends and the celebrated Victor of the battle of midway while one

162
00:08:54.191 --> 00:08:57.510
Admiral was leading the fleet into battle. The other was on shore planning.

163
00:08:57.511 --> 00:08:58.350
The next campaign,

164
00:08:58.620 --> 00:09:01.840
this allowed the Pacific fleet to increase the tempo of offensive actions around

165
00:09:01.841 --> 00:09:02.674
1944,

166
00:09:02.760 --> 00:09:05.970
in order to confuse the Japanese and make them believe the Americans that even

167
00:09:05.971 --> 00:09:08.700
more ships than they did well, Halsey was in commands.

168
00:09:08.701 --> 00:09:12.510
The fleet was referred to as the third fleet while spoons was in commands,

169
00:09:12.660 --> 00:09:16.860
it was referred to as the fifth fleet Spruance had commands of the fleet during

170
00:09:16.861 --> 00:09:17.880
the first half of the year,

171
00:09:17.910 --> 00:09:21.540
fighting in the Gilbert Marshall and Mariana islands, meanwhile,

172
00:09:22.020 --> 00:09:22.561
Halcyon Dustoff,

173
00:09:22.561 --> 00:09:26.340
which he dubbed the department of dirty tricks back in Hawaii planning for the

174
00:09:26.341 --> 00:09:30.540
most important and ambitious military operation in the Pacific to date,

175
00:09:30.720 --> 00:09:34.920
the liberation of the Philippine islands general Douglas MacArthur had requested

176
00:09:35.280 --> 00:09:37.740
Jose's assistance personally, as he was one of the few admirals,

177
00:09:37.741 --> 00:09:42.180
he was able to work well with a celebrated and also rather egotistical general.

178
00:09:42.210 --> 00:09:46.080
The third fleet, which act in conjunction with vice Admiral Thomas Kincaid,

179
00:09:46.081 --> 00:09:50.340
seventh fleet to provide the troop landings, bombard Japanese shore positions,

180
00:09:50.490 --> 00:09:54.960
and oppose any movement by the Japanese fleet. On October the 20th, 1944,

181
00:09:54.961 --> 00:09:58.650
American troops led by MacArthur landed on the islands of late and quickly

182
00:09:58.651 --> 00:10:02.040
pushed inland to the Japanese high command. The situation was dire.

183
00:10:02.220 --> 00:10:03.810
If they lost control of the Philippines,

184
00:10:03.840 --> 00:10:07.320
they would lose their fuel pipeline from the Dutch East Indies back to Japan.

185
00:10:07.500 --> 00:10:10.830
And they would run out of oil to power their Navy and air force and short.

186
00:10:10.831 --> 00:10:14.240
If they'd lost the Philippines, they would lose the war. They put into motion,

187
00:10:14.370 --> 00:10:18.360
an operation. They called Shogo one and almost all of their remaining ships,

188
00:10:18.361 --> 00:10:22.050
steam to the Philippines, setting up what would be the largest Naval battle of.

189
00:10:26.360 --> 00:10:27.193
<v 1>[Inaudible].</v>

190
00:10:29.780 --> 00:10:34.310
<v 0>Was to split their forces into three groups, Northern Southern and center force.</v>

191
00:10:34.340 --> 00:10:37.760
The Northern force had almost all of the Japanese Navy's remaining carrier

192
00:10:37.761 --> 00:10:38.331
forces,

193
00:10:38.331 --> 00:10:42.500
and it was supposed to lure Halsey's third fleet away from late aid to the North

194
00:10:42.501 --> 00:10:43.334
as a diversion.

195
00:10:43.370 --> 00:10:46.610
Then when the Southern forest kept to the seventh fleet occupied the powerful

196
00:10:46.611 --> 00:10:50.840
center force headlines by the two largest battleships ever built Yamato and

197
00:10:50.841 --> 00:10:55.220
Masashi would be free to steam unopposed to the landing positions later,

198
00:10:55.370 --> 00:10:56.540
where they would sink troop,

199
00:10:56.570 --> 00:11:00.590
transports and bombard the American troops on shore disrupting and perhaps

200
00:11:00.620 --> 00:11:04.490
stopping the invasion entirely American submarines detected the movements of the

201
00:11:04.491 --> 00:11:05.270
Japanese,

202
00:11:05.270 --> 00:11:09.320
sent a force on October the 23rd and reported it to Halsey who deployed as our

203
00:11:09.321 --> 00:11:10.280
wings in response.

204
00:11:10.340 --> 00:11:13.520
What we'd like to be known as the battle of Leyte Gulf was actually four

205
00:11:13.521 --> 00:11:16.040
separate battles in the waters around later.

206
00:11:16.100 --> 00:11:20.720
The first engagement was the battle of SIBO Yancy on October the 24th Aussies

207
00:11:20.721 --> 00:11:24.520
carrier aircraft attached to the center force commanded by Admiral Taiki.

208
00:11:24.560 --> 00:11:26.420
Corita inflicting heavy damage on it,

209
00:11:26.421 --> 00:11:29.720
including sinking the massaging Corita town districts around.

210
00:11:29.721 --> 00:11:33.680
So it got away from the aircraft and Holsey believes that he was retreating and

211
00:11:33.740 --> 00:11:35.600
was no longer a threat at the same time.

212
00:11:35.630 --> 00:11:39.140
Third fleet scout planes protected the Northern force and Halsey tenant,

213
00:11:39.290 --> 00:11:40.310
his fleet to engage them.

214
00:11:40.430 --> 00:11:43.580
What he didn't know was that the Northern force was the diversion that the

215
00:11:43.581 --> 00:11:47.420
carriers in the Japanese taskforce had few planes or air crews to threaten

216
00:11:47.810 --> 00:11:50.510
Halsey's fleet. They also didn't know that during the evening of October,

217
00:11:50.511 --> 00:11:54.880
the 24th Corita reversed course and steam does center force through the San

218
00:11:54.881 --> 00:11:55.990
Bernardino straight.

219
00:11:56.140 --> 00:11:58.930
This was towards the landing zone on the East side of later,

220
00:11:58.990 --> 00:12:02.410
the third fleet had two main components to it, taskforce 38,

221
00:12:02.411 --> 00:12:06.010
which consisted of the aircraft carriers and task force 34,

222
00:12:06.011 --> 00:12:08.620
which consisted of a group of powerful battleships.

223
00:12:08.680 --> 00:12:12.490
The seventh fleet commanded by Kincade believed that Halsey was leaving

224
00:12:13.120 --> 00:12:18.100
taskforce 34 to cover the San Bernardino straight taking only at taskforce 38 to

225
00:12:18.101 --> 00:12:19.990
attack the Northern force. As a result,

226
00:12:19.991 --> 00:12:23.830
Kincaid deployed his entire force to attack the Southern forest decisively

227
00:12:23.831 --> 00:12:27.040
defeating it and the battle of surrogate straight, uh, vicious,

228
00:12:27.041 --> 00:12:29.500
nighttime battle. That was the last time in history,

229
00:12:29.650 --> 00:12:31.480
battleships 40 each other directly,

230
00:12:31.570 --> 00:12:36.010
but how she had made a fateful decision taking the entire third fleet do attack

231
00:12:36.100 --> 00:12:40.210
the Northern force and leaving the San Bernardino straight completely unguarded

232
00:12:40.720 --> 00:12:42.280
Kincaid didn't realize until too late.

233
00:12:42.281 --> 00:12:44.770
What had happened and was too far away to intervene.

234
00:12:44.771 --> 00:12:46.570
When on the morning of October, the 25th,

235
00:12:46.690 --> 00:12:48.760
the center force consisting of four battleships,

236
00:12:48.790 --> 00:12:53.140
eight cruises and 11 destroyers steamed into the Philippine sea off the Island

237
00:12:53.141 --> 00:12:58.030
of Somar they're only American ships in the area was task group 77, four, three,

238
00:12:58.031 --> 00:12:59.050
known as taffy three,

239
00:12:59.051 --> 00:13:03.220
a group of small unarmored escort carriers protected by screen of destroyers

240
00:13:03.250 --> 00:13:07.210
taffy three was designed to act as close as support for the ground ribs and

241
00:13:07.211 --> 00:13:10.630
attack submarines knots, engaged capital ships and pinched battle.

242
00:13:11.050 --> 00:13:14.950
But the commander of taffy three rear Admiral Clifton sprog knew that he needed

243
00:13:14.951 --> 00:13:18.310
to buy as much time as he could until how Siegel King cage could come to his

244
00:13:18.311 --> 00:13:20.050
aid. So he engaged, courageous,

245
00:13:20.260 --> 00:13:23.140
sent a force with everything he had the battle of summer.

246
00:13:23.170 --> 00:13:25.570
Also known as the last stand of the tin can.

247
00:13:25.571 --> 00:13:28.840
Sailors was one of the most lopsided battles in Naval history,

248
00:13:28.841 --> 00:13:32.770
at least on paper. It is also considered one of the U S Navy's finest hours,

249
00:13:32.830 --> 00:13:34.120
taffy three Fort ship,

250
00:13:34.130 --> 00:13:38.020
several times the size of their own doing an incredible amount of damage for

251
00:13:38.021 --> 00:13:40.030
American ships Johnson. Samuel B.

252
00:13:40.030 --> 00:13:45.010
Roberts hole in Gambia Bay was sunken over 1,500 sailors were killed a figure

253
00:13:45.070 --> 00:13:49.810
representing half of the total American casualties of the entire battle of

254
00:13:49.811 --> 00:13:52.090
Leyte Gulf. So not the engagements at mural.

255
00:13:52.600 --> 00:13:56.320
Kincaid sent a string of urgent calls for help for taffy three to Halsey,

256
00:13:56.380 --> 00:13:56.801
but how's,

257
00:13:56.801 --> 00:14:00.760
he continued to steam his fleet North away from center force back in Hawaii,

258
00:14:00.970 --> 00:14:03.610
Admiral Nimitz was trying to understand what was going on.

259
00:14:03.910 --> 00:14:07.930
He sent a message to Halsey asking where taskforce 34 was messaged ended with a

260
00:14:07.931 --> 00:14:11.680
nonsense phrase. That didn't mean anything designed to confuse the Japanese.

261
00:14:11.681 --> 00:14:13.840
You might be listening in, but the sailors on board house,

262
00:14:14.020 --> 00:14:17.260
these flagship forgot to remove the phrase from the end of the message before

263
00:14:17.290 --> 00:14:20.860
delivering it to the Admiral. As a result of the message Chelsea received said,

264
00:14:21.100 --> 00:14:23.020
where is taskforce? 34,

265
00:14:23.350 --> 00:14:26.650
the world wonders Halsey who had a fiery temper at the best of times,

266
00:14:26.651 --> 00:14:28.210
lost his head completely. It,

267
00:14:28.450 --> 00:14:31.210
what he viewed as a stinging rebuke from his commanding officer.

268
00:14:31.420 --> 00:14:34.450
He threw his house on the grounds and began swearing violent, and the alarming,

269
00:14:34.451 --> 00:14:36.220
everyone on the bridge of his flagship,

270
00:14:36.550 --> 00:14:40.120
his chief of staff rear Admiral Connie yelled at him to get ahold of himself and

271
00:14:40.720 --> 00:14:41.553
Holsey calmed down.

272
00:14:41.590 --> 00:14:45.370
But it would be another two hours before he finally ordered taskforce 34 to turn

273
00:14:45.371 --> 00:14:49.210
around and go to taffy three's eight. But by the time they arrived on the scene,

274
00:14:49.390 --> 00:14:50.830
the Japanese center force was gone.

275
00:14:50.990 --> 00:14:55.010
Admiral Corita had met such ferocious resistance from taffy three that he became

276
00:14:55.011 --> 00:14:59.030
convinced he was fighting Halsey's third fleet and withdrew before he could

277
00:14:59.031 --> 00:15:01.460
accomplish his mission to disrupt the landings.

278
00:15:01.580 --> 00:15:05.210
A few hours later holds these carriers engaged Northern false in the battle of

279
00:15:05.480 --> 00:15:09.140
Cape and Ghana sinking all four remaining Japanese aircraft carriers.

280
00:15:09.200 --> 00:15:11.780
The battle of Leyte Gulf was a resounding American victory.

281
00:15:11.960 --> 00:15:14.750
The Japanese Navy was effectively finished as a fighting force.

282
00:15:14.780 --> 00:15:18.080
The remaining ships in their fleet returned to Japan and would not Saudi again

283
00:15:18.081 --> 00:15:20.000
in such a force for the rest of the war.

284
00:15:20.060 --> 00:15:23.540
The whole CS tactical mistake referred to as the wholesale blunder roll bulls

285
00:15:23.541 --> 00:15:25.970
run had colored his reputation quite a bit.

286
00:15:26.060 --> 00:15:28.460
His pension for aggressive action had worked against him.

287
00:15:28.500 --> 00:15:30.770
If it hadn't been for the heroic efforts of taffy three,

288
00:15:30.980 --> 00:15:33.110
the Americans could have met with disaster.

289
00:15:33.710 --> 00:15:35.210
Halsey would spend the rest of his life,

290
00:15:35.240 --> 00:15:38.090
defending his actions at later golf and attacking his critics

291
00:15:46.750 --> 00:15:47.920
And took another hit in December.

292
00:15:47.921 --> 00:15:51.460
When the third fleet was inundated by the powerful typhoon Cobra,

293
00:15:51.580 --> 00:15:55.060
Halsey believed the worst of the storm was going to pass to the North of his

294
00:15:55.061 --> 00:15:57.370
fleet and ordered his ships to remain on station.

295
00:15:57.610 --> 00:15:59.830
By the time he realized his mistake, it was too late.

296
00:15:59.890 --> 00:16:02.350
The ships were in the teeth of a vicious tropical cyclone,

297
00:16:02.560 --> 00:16:06.160
which caused three destroyers to sink over 100 aircraft to be washed off the

298
00:16:06.410 --> 00:16:09.790
deck of his carriers into the sea. And it killed 800 sailors.

299
00:16:10.270 --> 00:16:13.570
Kelsey faced the court of inquiry about his conduct regarding the typhoon,

300
00:16:13.690 --> 00:16:17.410
which stopped short of fully sanctioning him, which would have ended his career.

301
00:16:17.500 --> 00:16:21.520
Still. The storm became known as Halsey's typhoon among the third fleet sailors.

302
00:16:21.730 --> 00:16:26.320
As the enlisted men began to view the Admiral, his reckless incredibly in June,

303
00:16:26.320 --> 00:16:29.560
1945, Holsey again sailed his fleet through a storm typhoon Connie,

304
00:16:29.561 --> 00:16:31.300
which did even more damage to the fleet.

305
00:16:31.360 --> 00:16:33.820
The second court of inquiry recommended Halsey be reassigned,

306
00:16:33.850 --> 00:16:37.810
but Nimitz refused still loyal to one of his most trusted subordinates that

307
00:16:37.811 --> 00:16:41.830
ultimately did a matter as the Japanese surrender to the allies in August ending

308
00:16:41.831 --> 00:16:45.910
the war Hosea was present on the USS Missouri for the formal surrender of Japan

309
00:16:45.911 --> 00:16:50.860
in Tokyo Bay on September the third, 1945 in December, 1945,

310
00:16:50.861 --> 00:16:54.730
president Truman selected Holsey to be promoted to the five-star rank of fleet

311
00:16:54.760 --> 00:16:58.690
Admiral one of only four officers in the history of the Navy to attain this

312
00:16:58.691 --> 00:16:59.110
rank.

313
00:16:59.110 --> 00:17:03.010
He stepped down from active service in 1947 and later joins the board of the

314
00:17:03.011 --> 00:17:06.790
American cable and radio corporation serving until 1957. I don't know,

315
00:17:07.110 --> 00:17:10.570
Holsey died on August the 16th, 1959 at the age of 76.

316
00:17:10.630 --> 00:17:13.480
His body laid in state at the Washington national cathedral,

317
00:17:13.750 --> 00:17:17.500
and he was buried at Arlington national cemetery. America's foremost,

318
00:17:17.501 --> 00:17:18.340
military cemetery.

319
00:17:18.580 --> 00:17:21.910
William Halsey is one of the most important figures in world war two.

320
00:17:22.090 --> 00:17:25.690
He understood early on the importance of air power in the war against Japan,

321
00:17:25.810 --> 00:17:29.710
and that the best way to recover from the attack on Pearl Harbor was to use the

322
00:17:29.711 --> 00:17:33.340
Pacific fleets aircraft carriers in an aggressive manner to take on the

323
00:17:33.341 --> 00:17:34.090
Japanese.

324
00:17:34.090 --> 00:17:37.960
This focus on see based app power was not only instrumental in winning the

325
00:17:37.961 --> 00:17:42.070
Pacific war, but it continues to form the basis of American Naval doctrine.

326
00:17:42.190 --> 00:17:43.660
Almost 80 years later.

327
00:17:43.840 --> 00:17:48.040
It is perhaps a shame that his decisions during the battle of Leyte Gulf have to

328
00:17:48.041 --> 00:17:51.570
a large extent overshadowed his accomplishments from earlier in the war,

329
00:17:51.600 --> 00:17:55.230
but it was perhaps the price the Navy had to pay for having an aggressive

330
00:17:55.231 --> 00:17:58.920
commands like Halsey and command. One thing is for sure though,
