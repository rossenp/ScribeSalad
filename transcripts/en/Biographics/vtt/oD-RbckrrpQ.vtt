13
00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:35.953
<v 1>Yes.</v>

14
00:00:41.090 --> 00:00:43.460
<v 0>He was one of the 20th century's greatest icons.</v>

15
00:00:43.520 --> 00:00:48.290
When Nelson Mandela walked free from prison in 1990, having served 27 years,

16
00:00:48.470 --> 00:00:49.880
he was already world famous.

17
00:00:49.910 --> 00:00:53.480
The ones I'm leader of the armed wing of the African national Congress had been

18
00:00:53.481 --> 00:00:57.530
sentenced to life imprisonment for standing up to South Africa's racist

19
00:00:57.531 --> 00:00:58.400
apartheid regime.

20
00:00:58.520 --> 00:01:03.200
Yet it was while in jail that Mandela had transformed from an inexperienced

21
00:01:03.201 --> 00:01:08.090
Millicent into the man who would bring democracy to his nation first from

22
00:01:08.120 --> 00:01:10.010
his cell. And then as a free man,

23
00:01:10.011 --> 00:01:14.420
he negotiated an end to white minority rule the in franchisement of the black

24
00:01:14.421 --> 00:01:18.260
community and managed to steer South Africa away from a civil war.

25
00:01:18.380 --> 00:01:20.570
By the time he became president in 1994,

26
00:01:20.810 --> 00:01:25.360
his place in history was already assured. But while most of us know Mandela,

27
00:01:25.910 --> 00:01:27.770
statesman, what do we know about Mandela?

28
00:01:27.771 --> 00:01:32.720
The man born into royalty in 1918 Mandela entered a world which despised

29
00:01:32.721 --> 00:01:35.720
him simply for the color of his skin. First as a lawyer,

30
00:01:35.870 --> 00:01:40.430
then as a millisecond Mandela fought to change the world's a battle which would

31
00:01:40.431 --> 00:01:44.330
see him humiliated and incarcerated, but never beaten

32
00:01:50.660 --> 00:01:52.970
From the moment he was born on July the 18th,

33
00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:57.710
1918 Nelson Mandela's parents knew their boy was destined to shake things up.

34
00:01:57.770 --> 00:01:59.930
You can tell from the way they named him, Raleigh [inaudible],

35
00:01:59.960 --> 00:02:02.090
which translates as troublemaker butts,

36
00:02:02.120 --> 00:02:06.020
not even chief Henry mcgartland Mandela could have predicted just how much

37
00:02:06.050 --> 00:02:09.620
trouble his boy would. One day. Cause from the earliest age,

38
00:02:10.070 --> 00:02:12.470
Mandela's life was full of contradictions. On the one hand,

39
00:02:12.471 --> 00:02:15.560
he was a member of the Royal house of the thin blue people on the other.

40
00:02:15.561 --> 00:02:17.720
He didn't exactly live in luxury.

41
00:02:17.900 --> 00:02:21.620
His family slept on straw mats while his mother cooked over a simple hole in the

42
00:02:21.621 --> 00:02:24.800
floor, Mandela himself grew up wearing his father's old hand. Me downs,

43
00:02:24.920 --> 00:02:27.650
as far as duty aged five was to work as a harder,

44
00:02:27.800 --> 00:02:31.700
not exactly the sort of Royal upbringing you see in Disney movies.

45
00:02:31.760 --> 00:02:35.990
Still Mandela did have advantages that many other South Africans lacked from

46
00:02:35.991 --> 00:02:38.660
1925, he was able to attend school.

47
00:02:38.690 --> 00:02:42.890
Then still a luxury among the black community. Whereas teacher bestowed on him,

48
00:02:43.070 --> 00:02:46.880
the English name Nelson, when his father died at the end of the 1920s,

49
00:02:46.910 --> 00:02:50.690
he was adopted by the region of Themba allowing him to go and live in the great

50
00:02:50.691 --> 00:02:55.190
place of [inaudible]. And I'm sorry about the pronunciation on some of these,

51
00:02:55.490 --> 00:02:56.120
uh,

52
00:02:56.120 --> 00:03:00.130
I looked about when I can that only the pronunciation dictionary and later life

53
00:03:00.580 --> 00:03:03.190
Mandela would say it was here, that he learned about leadership.

54
00:03:03.280 --> 00:03:05.710
It was also where he learned to hide his pain.

55
00:03:05.770 --> 00:03:09.940
When he turns 16 Mandela underwent the traditional Rite of passage into manhood,

56
00:03:10.180 --> 00:03:13.360
a ceremony marked by circumcision with a spear.

57
00:03:15.100 --> 00:03:15.700
<v 2>Although he was.</v>

58
00:03:15.700 --> 00:03:19.900
<v 0>Prepared for it to Hertz, Mandela was shocked at just how intense the agony was.</v>

59
00:03:20.110 --> 00:03:23.830
It claimed it felt as if I was shooting through my veins. Yeah.

60
00:03:23.860 --> 00:03:27.340
He was also aware that to show his pain would be weakness.

61
00:03:27.370 --> 00:03:32.080
So he raised his head and lets out the cry of Nidia and Dota visibility to mask.

62
00:03:32.110 --> 00:03:36.670
Even the worst agony would become a hallmark of his life. By the late 1930s,

63
00:03:36.671 --> 00:03:41.050
Mandela was continuing his education way beyond what most nonwhites in South

64
00:03:41.050 --> 00:03:42.700
Africa country, mov age 19,

65
00:03:42.701 --> 00:03:45.790
he enrolled in the nation's only college for black students from there.

66
00:03:45.970 --> 00:03:50.050
It was onto university where he excelled at boxing and athletics and began to

67
00:03:50.051 --> 00:03:51.760
dream of joining the civil service.

68
00:03:51.761 --> 00:03:55.780
The highest career a black South African could then rise to sadly,

69
00:03:55.930 --> 00:04:00.220
this dream wouldn't last in 1940 Mandela took part in a student protest against

70
00:04:00.221 --> 00:04:04.750
the poor quality of canteen food rather than negotiate the school summarily

71
00:04:04.751 --> 00:04:05.530
expelled him.

72
00:04:05.530 --> 00:04:08.620
Mandela's guardian was furious telling him that he'd have to submit to an

73
00:04:08.621 --> 00:04:09.550
arranged marriage.

74
00:04:09.580 --> 00:04:13.450
If he wasn't going to study instead of Mandela flat stealing two cows from his

75
00:04:13.451 --> 00:04:17.380
guardian, he sold them and used the proceeds to fleet to Johannesburg there,

76
00:04:17.381 --> 00:04:22.120
he settled into the township of Alexandra cramped, overcrowded slum for blacks.

77
00:04:22.510 --> 00:04:24.820
First, the young man found work as a nightwatchman,

78
00:04:24.880 --> 00:04:29.280
but he was soon fought and left destitute and there his tail might've ended.

79
00:04:29.440 --> 00:04:31.570
It had not met Walter Sisulu.

80
00:04:31.840 --> 00:04:34.750
I real estate agents who was friends with one of Mandela's cousins.

81
00:04:34.751 --> 00:04:36.370
As soon as took the boy under his wing.

82
00:04:36.610 --> 00:04:40.210
He found a job for him as a law firm where Mandela was able to complete a

83
00:04:40.211 --> 00:04:42.610
correspondence course. But for our story today,

84
00:04:42.670 --> 00:04:47.530
the most important thing Mandela got from Sisulu was his friends as hung out

85
00:04:47.531 --> 00:04:52.000
with a whole lot of radicals from black African nationalists to white communists

86
00:04:52.030 --> 00:04:52.270
there.

87
00:04:52.270 --> 00:04:56.050
Do you think that had in common was that they wanted to tear down white minority

88
00:04:56.051 --> 00:04:59.680
rule? It was a fight that was about to get a whole lot more agents.

89
00:05:05.910 --> 00:05:10.020
Okay. So it's time for us to talk about the racist white elephants in the room.

90
00:05:10.110 --> 00:05:13.410
Apartheid. Although past eight efficiently began in 1948,

91
00:05:13.440 --> 00:05:17.910
less official forms of the system have been around almost since South Africa's

92
00:05:17.911 --> 00:05:19.230
1910 formation.

93
00:05:19.470 --> 00:05:24.450
The 1913 land act had begun the process of forcing black Africans to

94
00:05:24.451 --> 00:05:28.590
live on reserves in response to a small number of the black elite forms,

95
00:05:28.620 --> 00:05:33.360
what would become the African national Congress or ANSI to fight back?

96
00:05:33.510 --> 00:05:37.740
Not that they'd have much luck in the years leading up to 1948,

97
00:05:37.770 --> 00:05:42.210
the separation had grown more and more entrenched to the point that black people

98
00:05:42.240 --> 00:05:45.810
could only enter non-black areas for a specific reason,

99
00:05:45.960 --> 00:05:50.280
but baddest things where they were about to get worse on may the 26th,

100
00:05:50.300 --> 00:05:51.240
1948,

101
00:05:51.270 --> 00:05:55.560
the white voting population handed a sweeping win to the African and national

102
00:05:55.561 --> 00:05:59.840
party whose campaign had used the less racist dog whistles and

103
00:06:00.170 --> 00:06:02.090
more racist bull horns.

104
00:06:02.210 --> 00:06:06.260
It was the national party names and implemented a partite, meaning, uh,

105
00:06:06.261 --> 00:06:08.030
partners and Afrikaans,

106
00:06:08.031 --> 00:06:11.840
a system designs to not just separate black from white,

107
00:06:12.080 --> 00:06:14.690
but white from every other race as well.

108
00:06:14.870 --> 00:06:17.810
Sex and marriage between whites and non-whites was outlawed.

109
00:06:17.840 --> 00:06:21.560
And the entire South African population were sorted into the categories. White,

110
00:06:21.800 --> 00:06:24.620
black, or Bantu colored and Asian,

111
00:06:24.830 --> 00:06:29.210
every urban area was then segregated along those lines with only people from

112
00:06:29.211 --> 00:06:33.950
that category allowed to own a business live in or buy a property in the area.

113
00:06:34.100 --> 00:06:36.380
What job you could have, how you were educated.

114
00:06:36.381 --> 00:06:39.050
And even if you were allowed to political representation,

115
00:06:39.080 --> 00:06:41.330
all dependent on the color of your skin.

116
00:06:41.870 --> 00:06:46.400
And this was only the beginning in the mid 1950s to new land acts and did 80% of

117
00:06:46.430 --> 00:06:51.140
all land in South Africa to the white minority at a time when whites made up

118
00:06:51.170 --> 00:06:55.520
barely 20% of the population shortly after the government created 10 scattered

119
00:06:55.521 --> 00:06:56.600
African homelands.

120
00:06:56.630 --> 00:07:00.830
And so began the forcible relocation of all non urban blacks into these Bantu

121
00:07:01.610 --> 00:07:01.700
Stans,

122
00:07:01.700 --> 00:07:05.870
all tolls around 3.5 million people were dumped into these places where they

123
00:07:05.871 --> 00:07:08.420
plunged into extreme poverty. Meanwhile,

124
00:07:08.690 --> 00:07:13.070
that confiscated land was sold to whites at favorable rates. It was in short,

125
00:07:13.071 --> 00:07:14.840
a criminal racist system.

126
00:07:14.870 --> 00:07:19.580
One that became ever more militarized and murderous as time went on.

127
00:07:19.730 --> 00:07:24.110
It was also the system that compelled Nelson Mandela to fight by the time of the

128
00:07:24.111 --> 00:07:28.280
1948 election Mandela had already been a powerful member of the ANCs youth

129
00:07:28.281 --> 00:07:29.480
league for several years.

130
00:07:29.570 --> 00:07:34.310
During that time had radicalized more and more becoming attracted to an ideology

131
00:07:34.311 --> 00:07:36.200
of civil disobedience. At first,

132
00:07:36.201 --> 00:07:39.500
the platform of Mandela's had been ignored by the main ancy,

133
00:07:39.680 --> 00:07:41.780
but then the national party had come to power.

134
00:07:41.990 --> 00:07:46.190
It's the idea of resistance had taken off big time in 1949.

135
00:07:46.191 --> 00:07:50.660
The ANC officially adopted Mandela's program of action transforming itself into

136
00:07:50.930 --> 00:07:52.340
a Mullen's organization.

137
00:07:52.430 --> 00:07:55.910
But while Mandela was already preparing to fight the apartheid regime,

138
00:07:56.270 --> 00:07:59.780
he wasn't yet ready to make alliances to do so. In his early days,

139
00:07:59.781 --> 00:08:01.520
Mandela was a hardcore Africanist.

140
00:08:01.610 --> 00:08:05.600
Although the ANSI wanted to work with local Indian and communist movements,

141
00:08:05.810 --> 00:08:09.140
Mandela refuse to get involved. His efforts led to the ANC,

142
00:08:09.170 --> 00:08:13.070
sitting out to communist organized strike in may of 1950, because of this,

143
00:08:13.071 --> 00:08:16.910
the apartheid regime was able to crack down on the strike as much harder

144
00:08:16.970 --> 00:08:21.890
unleashing a wave of brutality that shocks Mandela to his core in

145
00:08:21.891 --> 00:08:25.700
the aftermath of the carnage Mandela met with his fellow ANSI member Oliver

146
00:08:25.701 --> 00:08:29.690
Tambo who told him today, it is our communist party tomorrow.

147
00:08:29.691 --> 00:08:32.420
It will be our trade unions are Indian Congress.

148
00:08:32.540 --> 00:08:35.030
Then our African national Congress.

149
00:08:35.210 --> 00:08:37.850
It was the beginning of a sea change in Mandela's attitude,

150
00:08:37.910 --> 00:08:41.420
no longer would he take a narrow Africanist view of the struggle against

151
00:08:41.421 --> 00:08:45.110
apartheid from now on he'll take help from wherever you could get.

152
00:08:51.880 --> 00:08:55.710
The further the ANZ moved towards radical action. The higher its ranks,

153
00:08:56.130 --> 00:08:57.780
Mandela Rose eventually becoming deputy.

154
00:08:58.380 --> 00:09:01.800
President's a huge part of it came down to Mandela's ability to organize people.

155
00:09:01.950 --> 00:09:06.540
He was a key player in a 1952 rally where attendees burns their passbooks

156
00:09:06.840 --> 00:09:10.110
kind of internal passport for nonwhites under the regime.

157
00:09:10.290 --> 00:09:13.080
He was also good at building bridges with other organizations,

158
00:09:13.081 --> 00:09:17.160
helping to create the multi-racial Congress Alliance against apartheid.

159
00:09:17.280 --> 00:09:21.360
And he took his activism into his personal life too in 1952 and Mandela and all

160
00:09:21.361 --> 00:09:24.690
of the Tambo opens the country's first black law partnership.

161
00:09:24.810 --> 00:09:27.690
Naturally all this invited attention in December of that year,

162
00:09:27.691 --> 00:09:31.620
Mandela was placed under a travel ban for bidding him from leaving Johannesburg.

163
00:09:31.740 --> 00:09:34.560
It was meant to stymie Mandela's political organizing,

164
00:09:34.620 --> 00:09:38.670
but the Wylie young lawyer just turns to other means helping organize the

165
00:09:38.671 --> 00:09:43.380
rainbow Congress of the people from afar taking place just outside of Joburg.

166
00:09:43.410 --> 00:09:46.380
Mandela could only watch from a distant rooftop.

167
00:09:46.560 --> 00:09:48.510
As the Congress affirms a freedom charter,

168
00:09:48.511 --> 00:09:53.190
which red South Africa belongs to all who live in it, black or white.

169
00:09:53.340 --> 00:09:55.920
It was a powerful, simple statement of trees,

170
00:09:56.100 --> 00:10:00.810
but it was also like waving a red flag that the racist Afrikana bull

171
00:10:01.050 --> 00:10:05.700
Mandela was arrested alongside 155 other members of Congress Alliance and

172
00:10:05.701 --> 00:10:09.600
charged with treason. His trial would drag on for the rest of the decade.

173
00:10:09.690 --> 00:10:13.710
All the while the brutal realities of apartheid only got more brutal.

174
00:10:13.830 --> 00:10:18.660
The pinnacle of all of this may have been the shop film massacre in March,

175
00:10:18.660 --> 00:10:22.230
1960 white police officers unloaded submachine guns into a crowd of black

176
00:10:22.920 --> 00:10:26.460
protesters killing 69, but rather than blame the racist cops,

177
00:10:26.580 --> 00:10:31.530
the government blamed the ANC banded outright yet they still couldn't stop.

178
00:10:31.531 --> 00:10:35.100
Its most famous son from organizing Mandela was eventually acquitted at

179
00:10:35.460 --> 00:10:38.910
histories and trial and vanished undergrounds becoming a semi legendary figure.

180
00:10:38.910 --> 00:10:42.090
Always one step ahead of the police. Although his law firm collapsed,

181
00:10:42.150 --> 00:10:45.870
he still had his contacts and he still had his organizational skills,

182
00:10:45.930 --> 00:10:49.650
but he had something else now to a growing sense of anger.

183
00:10:49.860 --> 00:10:52.380
The more black bodies piled up at the hands of the police,

184
00:10:52.500 --> 00:10:55.140
the more lands were swiped from nonwhites.

185
00:10:55.200 --> 00:10:59.550
The more Mandela became convinced peaceful resistance is not the answer.

186
00:10:59.760 --> 00:11:01.860
A freedom fighter learns the hard way, you know,

187
00:11:01.861 --> 00:11:06.390
to said that it is the oppressor who defines the nature of the struggle and the

188
00:11:06.391 --> 00:11:08.430
oppressed is often left no recourse,

189
00:11:08.640 --> 00:11:13.140
but to use methods that mirror those of the oppressor at a certain points,

190
00:11:13.440 --> 00:11:17.280
one can only fight fire with fire for Mandela.

191
00:11:17.700 --> 00:11:21.530
That certain point came in June of 1961, along with a closed cell of loyalists.

192
00:11:21.540 --> 00:11:24.720
He formed whom console. We sees war the spirit of the nation.

193
00:11:24.960 --> 00:11:28.020
They got hold of guns and they began preparing explosives.

194
00:11:28.320 --> 00:11:32.430
And even now there was a sense that becoming a man of violence wasn't Mandela's

195
00:11:32.431 --> 00:11:36.180
destiny that summer as he lay low on a friend's from Rivonia,

196
00:11:36.300 --> 00:11:39.840
his second wife Winnie brought him a rifle, practicing his aim,

197
00:11:39.900 --> 00:11:44.040
Mandela shot a Sparrow dead only for his friend's five-year-old son to

198
00:11:44.100 --> 00:11:47.340
immediately start shouting at him. Why did you kill the bird?

199
00:11:47.850 --> 00:11:50.310
It's mother will be sad. According to Mandela,

200
00:11:50.700 --> 00:11:53.740
my mood immediately shifted from one of pride to shame.

201
00:11:53.950 --> 00:11:57.670
I felt this small boy had far more humanity than I did. Yes.

202
00:11:57.671 --> 00:12:01.030
Mandela had already chosen this path in December,

203
00:12:01.030 --> 00:12:04.690
1961 spare of the nation set off its first bombs at government installations.

204
00:12:04.810 --> 00:12:06.580
Although the attacks avoided casualties,

205
00:12:06.581 --> 00:12:10.330
they still put Mandela in the crosshairs of intelligence agencies across the

206
00:12:10.331 --> 00:12:14.230
globe. When he abandoned South Africa for eight months in 1962,

207
00:12:14.440 --> 00:12:17.350
it was with scary entities like the CIA watching him.

208
00:12:17.560 --> 00:12:21.460
And that may explain what happened next that August Nelson Mandela returned to

209
00:12:21.461 --> 00:12:24.310
South Africa. Although in disguise, he was arrested by police.

210
00:12:24.370 --> 00:12:29.350
He knew exactly who he was long rumored to have been due to a CIA tip-off that

211
00:12:29.351 --> 00:12:33.310
day, August the fifth, 1962 was the end of Mandela's time as a free man.

212
00:12:33.490 --> 00:12:38.050
When he finally left jail again, 27 long years would have passed.

213
00:12:44.280 --> 00:12:45.000
<v 4>[Inaudible] originally.</v>

214
00:12:45.000 --> 00:12:48.630
<v 0>The Mandela wasn't meant to spend anything like three decades behind bars in</v>

215
00:12:48.631 --> 00:12:52.470
1962, all the police could prove was that it left the country illegally.

216
00:12:52.471 --> 00:12:56.910
So he received a mere five years, unfortunately, half a year into his sentence.

217
00:12:56.911 --> 00:13:00.720
The police raided a safe house and discovered a stack of bomb making materials

218
00:13:00.810 --> 00:13:03.900
and to legal documents. All of which could be traced back to Mandela.

219
00:13:03.960 --> 00:13:07.380
The result was the Rivonia trial named after the leafy suburb,

220
00:13:07.410 --> 00:13:10.800
the safe house was found in starting in October of 1963.

221
00:13:11.040 --> 00:13:14.370
It returns Mandela to court alongside other ANC leaders.

222
00:13:14.430 --> 00:13:18.030
The death penalty seemed such a foregone conclusion that Mandela used his last

223
00:13:18.031 --> 00:13:21.330
day and the doctor make a bond storming four hour speech,

224
00:13:21.480 --> 00:13:24.090
which ended with him declaring during my lifetime,

225
00:13:24.180 --> 00:13:27.360
I have dedicated myself to this struggle of the African people.

226
00:13:27.480 --> 00:13:30.960
I have fought against white domination and I have fought against black

227
00:13:30.961 --> 00:13:31.710
domination.

228
00:13:31.710 --> 00:13:36.420
I have cherished the ideal of a democratic and free society in which all persons

229
00:13:36.421 --> 00:13:39.330
live together in harmony and with equal opportunities.

230
00:13:39.450 --> 00:13:43.230
It is an ideal which I hope to live for and to achieve.

231
00:13:43.410 --> 00:13:48.090
But if needs be, it is an ideal for which I am prepared to die,

232
00:13:48.300 --> 00:13:52.620
but die is exactly what Mandela didn't do. Instead.

233
00:13:52.650 --> 00:13:55.650
He was sentenced to life in prison on Robben islands.

234
00:13:55.830 --> 00:13:57.330
It's hard to comprehend nowadays.

235
00:13:57.360 --> 00:14:01.440
Just what a minor figure Mandela was when he went into prison and compared with

236
00:14:01.500 --> 00:14:05.130
who he was when he came out. Sure. He had a big following in South Africa.

237
00:14:05.190 --> 00:14:09.060
I'm sure his travels in 1962 had seen him make connections with important

238
00:14:09.061 --> 00:14:09.780
people,

239
00:14:09.780 --> 00:14:14.010
but he wasn't internationally famous where you do ask someone in mid 1960s,

240
00:14:14.011 --> 00:14:18.000
America who Nelson Mandela was that probably assume you had some weird speech

241
00:14:18.001 --> 00:14:21.960
impediments that prevented you from saying Nelson Rockefeller. Nope.

242
00:14:22.020 --> 00:14:26.580
The reason Mandela became an icon isn't because of his life before Robin Island,

243
00:14:26.730 --> 00:14:30.180
but because of his unjust imprisonment, that however,

244
00:14:30.240 --> 00:14:34.920
that recognition would take decades to accumulate decades in which Mandela lived

245
00:14:34.921 --> 00:14:37.230
a life of numbing TDM in prisons,

246
00:14:37.231 --> 00:14:41.490
alongside other ANZ members in section B Mandela was forced to do backbreaking

247
00:14:41.491 --> 00:14:46.050
later in the midday heat first in a lime quarry, then breaking boulders.

248
00:14:46.410 --> 00:14:50.610
He was allowed to write only a single letter every six months and receive two

249
00:14:50.611 --> 00:14:50.971
visits.

250
00:14:50.971 --> 00:14:55.190
A there was no compassionate leave when both his mother and eldest son passed

251
00:14:55.191 --> 00:14:59.660
away in quick succession, Mandela was refused permission to attend the funerals.

252
00:14:59.840 --> 00:15:02.300
It was a life designed to make the world,

253
00:15:02.301 --> 00:15:06.020
forget you to cut you off from your family and network,

254
00:15:06.320 --> 00:15:10.730
but both Mandela's allies and his enemies conspired to keep his memory alive

255
00:15:10.910 --> 00:15:11.421
wisely.

256
00:15:11.421 --> 00:15:15.530
The ANZ used him as a symbol for all the political prisoners of apartheid giving

257
00:15:15.531 --> 00:15:18.170
the international community, uh, named a natural zoo.

258
00:15:18.230 --> 00:15:21.530
But it was also thanks to the apartheid government who saw his growing

259
00:15:21.531 --> 00:15:25.430
reputation and started making them offers such as freedom in return for

260
00:15:25.550 --> 00:15:30.230
recognizing the controversial black homelands that that established naturally

261
00:15:30.530 --> 00:15:31.610
Mandela refused.

262
00:15:31.640 --> 00:15:36.200
But it's maybe too easy to portray the Mandela story as simply that of a Saint

263
00:15:36.290 --> 00:15:38.810
changing the world from inside his prison cell,

264
00:15:38.990 --> 00:15:42.500
as admirable as Mandela's courage and dignity, where in this period,

265
00:15:42.800 --> 00:15:44.600
he really was just a simple,

266
00:15:44.690 --> 00:15:48.170
it was the people on the ground who were doing the tricky work of bringing down

267
00:15:48.171 --> 00:15:49.550
a partite. Thanks to them.

268
00:15:49.580 --> 00:15:53.750
Mandela would be perfectly positioned when the time came to lead his country to

269
00:15:53.751 --> 00:15:54.584
democracy.

270
00:16:00.670 --> 00:16:00.880
<v 5>[Inaudible].</v>

271
00:16:00.880 --> 00:16:04.810
<v 0>The 1970s dragged on South Africa began acting more and more like the</v>

272
00:16:05.620 --> 00:16:08.230
geopolitical equivalent of Cujo. The rabbit dog.

273
00:16:08.290 --> 00:16:12.130
There was the Soweto uprising when police fired tear gas and rubber bullets into

274
00:16:12.131 --> 00:16:15.250
a crowd of schoolchildren injuring 4,000,

275
00:16:15.340 --> 00:16:19.420
that was the repressive crackdown afterwards where 500 black activists were

276
00:16:19.421 --> 00:16:23.470
detained and killed. Then there was the new government formed under PW,

277
00:16:23.471 --> 00:16:24.790
both or in 1978,

278
00:16:24.880 --> 00:16:28.390
although it relaxed the rules on what had been called petty apartheid,

279
00:16:28.420 --> 00:16:31.030
desegregating hotels, allowing interracial marriage.

280
00:16:31.150 --> 00:16:34.030
It also acted increasingly like a military dictatorship.

281
00:16:34.300 --> 00:16:39.010
This is a home where in prisons without charge others abroad were assassinated

282
00:16:39.011 --> 00:16:41.170
by the intelligence services by 1980,

283
00:16:41.171 --> 00:16:43.870
both as governments was engaged in dangerous military,

284
00:16:43.871 --> 00:16:45.460
adventurism all over Africa,

285
00:16:46.450 --> 00:16:48.400
destabilizing its neighbors and meddling and civil Wars.

286
00:16:48.460 --> 00:16:52.720
They even developed their own nuclear arsenal testing a bomb in 1979. Yeah,

287
00:16:52.750 --> 00:16:57.340
none of this posturing could destroy the rot, eating the regime alive.

288
00:16:57.610 --> 00:17:00.490
The rot known as apartheid by 1982,

289
00:17:00.580 --> 00:17:03.700
an international campaign to free all political prisoners in the nation was

290
00:17:03.701 --> 00:17:06.430
gathering steam, known as released Nelson Mandela.

291
00:17:06.490 --> 00:17:10.510
It called for sanctions and a boycott against South Africa until it embraced

292
00:17:10.511 --> 00:17:11.770
democracy. In response,

293
00:17:11.771 --> 00:17:15.580
both at trying to unveil a new constitution that gave the racial categories of

294
00:17:15.610 --> 00:17:19.390
Asian and colored ball rights while still keeping black people oppressed.

295
00:17:19.480 --> 00:17:23.800
But it didn't work. Instead. Community groups forms the United democratic front,

296
00:17:23.801 --> 00:17:27.160
which paralyzed the state with strikes and attacks on the police.

297
00:17:27.220 --> 00:17:30.220
At the same time, the NC began a new phase in its Tara campaign.

298
00:17:30.280 --> 00:17:31.960
Well not authorized by Mandela.

299
00:17:31.961 --> 00:17:35.080
This included the bowling of public buildings come 1985.

300
00:17:35.081 --> 00:17:38.710
The economy was hurting under sanctions and both had imposed a state of

301
00:17:38.711 --> 00:17:40.030
emergency soldiers,

302
00:17:40.360 --> 00:17:43.930
drove armored trucks into black townships rounding up and torturing tens of

303
00:17:43.931 --> 00:17:44.764
thousands,

304
00:17:44.980 --> 00:17:49.120
thousands more when added yet this state repression was unsustainable.

305
00:17:49.230 --> 00:17:52.530
Something even both are realized in 1985,

306
00:17:52.531 --> 00:17:56.490
he made two separate offers to free Mandela asking only that he renounced

307
00:17:56.491 --> 00:18:00.240
violence. Both times Mandela refused it's here,

308
00:18:00.241 --> 00:18:04.470
that we can see some of what made Nelson Mandela. So great.

309
00:18:04.590 --> 00:18:07.260
Although he had now been in prison for over 20 years,

310
00:18:07.320 --> 00:18:09.360
Mandela refused to take the easy route out.

311
00:18:09.450 --> 00:18:13.260
He wants it democracy in South Africa, not just his own freedom.

312
00:18:13.380 --> 00:18:17.850
And he was willing to wait and suffer until both or was ready to deliver it.

313
00:18:18.090 --> 00:18:22.290
But in the end it wouldn't be both. Or you cut the deal in 1986,

314
00:18:22.291 --> 00:18:24.690
the U S followed the UN's example with Congress,

315
00:18:24.691 --> 00:18:27.030
bringing in stinging sanctions against South Africa.

316
00:18:27.060 --> 00:18:31.410
When this was followed by an uproar after Mandela nearly died in prison of

317
00:18:31.411 --> 00:18:33.510
tuberculosis, even the national party,

318
00:18:33.511 --> 00:18:36.750
you could see the writing was on the wall on July the fourth, 1989.

319
00:18:36.751 --> 00:18:40.620
Both came to personally, see Mandela now transferred to house arrest.

320
00:18:40.740 --> 00:18:42.900
When both are refused, the prisoners schools are free.

321
00:18:42.901 --> 00:18:45.030
All of those convicted of political crimes,

322
00:18:45.510 --> 00:18:50.010
he sealed his own fate and months later his own party to post him bringing in

323
00:18:50.100 --> 00:18:52.650
the younger FW to cluck, to Clark,

324
00:18:52.651 --> 00:18:56.130
who is more than capable of seeing which way the winds were blowing.

325
00:18:56.340 --> 00:18:59.130
All that December. The new president held his first meeting with Mandela.

326
00:18:59.250 --> 00:19:02.100
Although their relationship would be frost with Mandela,

327
00:19:02.130 --> 00:19:05.400
never entirely convinced he wasn't just dealing with another racist.

328
00:19:05.910 --> 00:19:09.240
There was enough common grounds between them to open negotiations,

329
00:19:09.300 --> 00:19:13.680
but first Declarc would have to win the ANCs trust. On February. The second,

330
00:19:13.681 --> 00:19:17.430
1990 to clock made a speech freeing all political prisoners in South Africa.

331
00:19:17.550 --> 00:19:21.720
It was so fast that even Mandela was taken aback with almost zero time to

332
00:19:21.721 --> 00:19:22.290
prepare.

333
00:19:22.290 --> 00:19:25.770
It was suddenly released on February the 11th on a day that would go down in

334
00:19:25.771 --> 00:19:27.600
history. Camera crews gathered to film.

335
00:19:27.601 --> 00:19:31.860
One of the world's longest serving political prisoners as he walks out of Victor

336
00:19:32.250 --> 00:19:36.540
Vasta prison and into legend. Although his first words were resounding.

337
00:19:36.810 --> 00:19:38.850
I agreed to you all in the name of peace,

338
00:19:38.970 --> 00:19:43.650
democracy and freedom for all Mandela later revealed just how confused had been

339
00:19:43.770 --> 00:19:47.190
that the attention part of this was to do with changes in technology.

340
00:19:47.280 --> 00:19:49.650
When he first saw a news crew point of boom, Mike asked him,

341
00:19:49.950 --> 00:19:52.050
he thought it was an assassination attempt yet.

342
00:19:52.110 --> 00:19:56.430
Despite the overwhelming sensation of suddenly being both three and a celebrity

343
00:19:56.760 --> 00:20:01.110
Mandela, didn't let it cloud his mind. It was time for the real work to begin

344
00:20:07.580 --> 00:20:09.830
In the multitude of parallel universes out there.

345
00:20:09.831 --> 00:20:13.520
There are a whole ton where South Africa in the early 1990s,

346
00:20:13.760 --> 00:20:16.160
when the way of Yugoslavia with apartheid crumbling,

347
00:20:16.250 --> 00:20:19.280
huge swaths of the population were itching for civil war.

348
00:20:19.310 --> 00:20:22.220
There were white supremacists who wanted to maintain their privilege.

349
00:20:22.460 --> 00:20:26.030
There were black radicals who felt a violin reckoning was the only way forward,

350
00:20:26.240 --> 00:20:28.550
but there were also regional leaders ready to succeed.

351
00:20:28.640 --> 00:20:32.810
Opportunists who saw violence as a way to accumulate money or power in short,

352
00:20:33.170 --> 00:20:34.400
the nation was on the brink.

353
00:20:34.610 --> 00:20:38.660
The only reason it didn't fall into the abyss was due to Nelson Mandela

354
00:20:38.900 --> 00:20:41.510
negotiations to end apartheid began in 1990,

355
00:20:41.511 --> 00:20:44.000
but it was a long and painful process.

356
00:20:44.150 --> 00:20:46.280
Although Mandela was made leader of the ANC,

357
00:20:46.430 --> 00:20:49.420
he couldn't stop political violence. That was gripping his country.

358
00:20:49.570 --> 00:20:52.930
There were massacres assassinations, even as negotiations,

359
00:20:53.820 --> 00:20:56.370
it keeps looking like everything might fall apart.

360
00:20:56.580 --> 00:21:01.290
Like the only way out might be bloody conflict. Yes, Mandela never.

361
00:21:01.380 --> 00:21:04.410
I gave up on a peaceful solution, deepen his heart Mandela.

362
00:21:04.411 --> 00:21:08.580
Sincerely believed a rainbow South Africa was the way forward.

363
00:21:08.700 --> 00:21:11.070
One that existed for all races.

364
00:21:11.550 --> 00:21:15.480
Had he not been so convinced Mandela may have never found the strength to push

365
00:21:15.481 --> 00:21:16.890
on with negotiations,

366
00:21:17.100 --> 00:21:21.960
but Mandela persevered and his perseverance paid off in September of 1993.

367
00:21:21.961 --> 00:21:26.220
The ANC and national party agreed to the date for South Africa's first

368
00:21:26.250 --> 00:21:28.500
democratic election for their efforts Mandela.

369
00:21:28.501 --> 00:21:30.630
And Declarc won the Nobel peace prize,

370
00:21:30.690 --> 00:21:35.340
but it was touch and go until the very last second on April the 27th, 1994,

371
00:21:35.341 --> 00:21:39.960
the ANC won a staggering 62% of the vote in South Africa and the first

372
00:21:40.020 --> 00:21:41.220
post-apartheid election.

373
00:21:41.430 --> 00:21:44.910
And just like that Nelson Mandela became president of the nation that had tried

374
00:21:44.911 --> 00:21:48.930
to destroy him and his inauguration speech Mandela pledge to build a rainbow

375
00:21:48.931 --> 00:21:53.610
nation. He made Dick Clark VP creating a government of national unity.

376
00:21:54.000 --> 00:21:57.000
His biggest breakthrough though came in the immediate aftermath when he

377
00:21:57.001 --> 00:22:01.740
succeeded in drawing white right-wing parties into negotiation. After that,

378
00:22:01.770 --> 00:22:05.940
it was only extremists who continued to insist that the new government was that

379
00:22:05.941 --> 00:22:06.720
legitimate.

380
00:22:06.720 --> 00:22:10.770
The first few years of the Mandela presidency were filled with historic moments.

381
00:22:10.830 --> 00:22:13.560
There was the establishment of the truth and reconciliation commission,

382
00:22:13.561 --> 00:22:17.520
which allows perpetrators of crimes do apply for amnesty and exchange for

383
00:22:17.521 --> 00:22:19.200
confessing while not perfect.

384
00:22:19.440 --> 00:22:22.560
It has since been held up as a model for post-conflict societies,

385
00:22:22.710 --> 00:22:26.670
creating an impartial system that allows families at the debt to discover the

386
00:22:26.671 --> 00:22:30.360
truth. This included truths that were personally embarrassing for Mandela,

387
00:22:30.420 --> 00:22:33.900
as it was revealed that his ex-wife when he masterminded the abductions and

388
00:22:33.901 --> 00:22:35.910
murders of suspected informers.

389
00:22:36.300 --> 00:22:39.300
Another great moments was the unveiling of the new democratic constitution in

390
00:22:39.301 --> 00:22:43.140
1996, forever consigning whites minority rule to the dustbin.

391
00:22:43.200 --> 00:22:47.670
But the most emotional moments likely came in 1995 at the rugby world cup

392
00:22:47.760 --> 00:22:50.010
Mandela, openly supported his nation's team.

393
00:22:50.220 --> 00:22:54.480
The Springboks until only recently a team associated with apartheid rule.

394
00:22:54.540 --> 00:22:56.220
When he presented the trophy to the captain,

395
00:22:56.730 --> 00:23:00.150
it was a national moment of healing, but of course Mandela's presidency.

396
00:23:00.180 --> 00:23:02.460
Wasn't just a listen to your feel-good moments.

397
00:23:02.670 --> 00:23:06.750
He badly misjudged the AIDS crisis. Something had deeply regret later in life.

398
00:23:06.960 --> 00:23:09.840
He also cozied up to some super shady regimes,

399
00:23:09.870 --> 00:23:14.010
openly embracing both Colonel Gaddafi and Robert McGarty by launch late when

400
00:23:14.011 --> 00:23:16.980
Mandela stepped down after a single time in 1999,

401
00:23:17.310 --> 00:23:19.770
it was with a sentence of Trump just nine years earlier,

402
00:23:20.100 --> 00:23:23.760
it walked out of prison into a deeply divided nation on the brink of civil war.

403
00:23:23.850 --> 00:23:28.560
Now he was stepping down as leader of a multiracial democracy that had finally

404
00:23:28.561 --> 00:23:30.570
made peace right itself. Of course, history.

405
00:23:30.570 --> 00:23:34.320
Isn't a fairytale South African presidents placed Mandela or struggles with

406
00:23:34.321 --> 00:23:35.850
corruption and cronyism.

407
00:23:36.150 --> 00:23:39.030
But the fact remains the man and Della himself was a model leader,

408
00:23:39.210 --> 00:23:42.210
a man who continued to do good, even after the presidency,

409
00:23:42.211 --> 00:23:46.730
by working in conflict, mediation and raising awareness of HIV. Sadly,

410
00:23:47.150 --> 00:23:51.740
not even history's greatest leaders can stay around forever. In January,

411
00:23:51.740 --> 00:23:55.190
2011 Mandela was checked into hospital beginnings of a long illness that would

412
00:23:55.191 --> 00:23:58.370
eventually play in his life. Although we plan on for nearly three years,

413
00:23:58.730 --> 00:24:01.970
there was nothing that could be done. Nelson Mandela died on December the fifth,

414
00:24:02.000 --> 00:24:05.660
2013 at the age of 95 with his passing,

415
00:24:05.780 --> 00:24:08.510
the world lost the true hero of the 20th century.

416
00:24:08.660 --> 00:24:12.200
One of the few great leaders who deserved his reputation today,

417
00:24:12.290 --> 00:24:13.520
over half a decade later,

418
00:24:13.550 --> 00:24:17.900
we live in a world that seems to be sliding ever further into division who Wells

419
00:24:17.901 --> 00:24:21.650
in which hatred is the new normal and forgiveness is a sign of weakness.

420
00:24:21.770 --> 00:24:24.860
It's a world in which we need the example of Nelson Mandela,

421
00:24:25.160 --> 00:24:29.720
more urgently than ever here was a man who suffered under his enemies in ways we

422
00:24:29.721 --> 00:24:34.250
can't possibly imagine a man who saw a racist regime, destroy everything.

423
00:24:34.280 --> 00:24:38.270
He helped death. And yet when the time came Mandela, didn't choose to hit back.

424
00:24:38.630 --> 00:24:41.120
He didn't choose the easy path of violence. No,

425
00:24:41.121 --> 00:24:46.040
instead he chose the much harder path of understanding of reconciliation of

426
00:24:46.041 --> 00:24:49.370
healing. It was a tough path to work on fraught with dangerous,

427
00:24:49.371 --> 00:24:52.700
but in the end Mandela did it showing his countrymen that division was not

428
00:24:52.701 --> 00:24:56.660
natural. That war is not inevitable for setting this example.

429
00:24:56.900 --> 00:25:00.080
He remains one of the greatest leaders who ever lived.

430
00:25:02.150 --> 00:25:04.070
