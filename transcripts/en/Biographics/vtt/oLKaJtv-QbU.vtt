get a brilliant.org/biographics more about brilliance in a bit.

3
00:00:13.400 --> 00:00:16.640
Louis pastor was the chemist has gone down in history as one of the fathers of

4
00:00:16.641 --> 00:00:20.400
microbiology. He is famous for several accomplishments that changed science.

5
00:00:20.650 --> 00:00:21.311
As we know it,

6
00:00:21.311 --> 00:00:25.870
including the pasteurization process of killing bacteria from liquids and paving

7
00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:30.270
the way for immunology by creating lifesaving vaccines, these accomplishments,

8
00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:34.710
they're just the tip of the iceberg because without pastor's revolutionary germ

9
00:00:34.711 --> 00:00:38.350
theory, modern medicine would not be anything like it is today.

10
00:00:38.690 --> 00:00:39.990
On this episode of biographics,

11
00:00:39.991 --> 00:00:44.780
we are talking out the life and work of Louis pastor and why he was one

12
00:00:45.040 --> 00:00:46.940
of history's greatest minds.

13
00:00:53.420 --> 00:00:56.740
Louis pastor was born in France on December the 27th, 1822.

14
00:00:56.760 --> 00:01:00.940
He was raised in a town called AOI by his parents, JF pastor,

15
00:01:02.410 --> 00:01:07.090
et his father served as a Sergeant during the Napoleonic war and received the

16
00:01:07.091 --> 00:01:08.610
Legion of honor. After the war genre,

17
00:01:08.810 --> 00:01:13.250
Joseph worked as a fulltime leather Tanner like generations of pasta men before

18
00:01:13.251 --> 00:01:15.770
him, even though this was the family business,

19
00:01:16.410 --> 00:01:19.930
Jean Joseph did not want to force his son to carry on the tanning trade and was

20
00:01:19.931 --> 00:01:22.600
open to allowing him to find his zone passion.

21
00:01:22.790 --> 00:01:27.160
Usually when we hear stories of accomplished academic minds like Louis pastor,

22
00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:31.560
we imagine that they must have been geniuses their whole life. In reality,

23
00:01:31.730 --> 00:01:35.280
young Louis was a very average student in school as a young man.

24
00:01:35.281 --> 00:01:37.560
He was actually far more interested in sketching,

25
00:01:37.561 --> 00:01:39.440
works of art than reading his textbooks.

26
00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:43.030
He spent a lot of time drawing and painting using the J amount in his

27
00:01:43.031 --> 00:01:43.864
inspiration.

28
00:01:43.990 --> 00:01:47.870
Louis pastor's father encouraged him to follow his passion for art and consider

29
00:01:47.871 --> 00:01:51.430
the endeavor to be just as valuable as academic goals. George,

30
00:01:51.830 --> 00:01:54.990
there always encouraged Louis to read as many books as possible so that he

31
00:01:54.991 --> 00:01:57.470
remained curious about the world around him. As a veteran,

32
00:01:57.650 --> 00:02:02.470
he also instilled a sense of national pride to Louis and a duty to the people

33
00:02:02.471 --> 00:02:06.860
of France since he spent most of his young life daydreaming and sketching li

34
00:02:07.180 --> 00:02:10.660
actually felt so far behind academically that he had to receive a lot of

35
00:02:10.860 --> 00:02:12.900
tutoring help at college AOI,

36
00:02:12.910 --> 00:02:17.500
which is where he went to secondary school before attending university at Thema

37
00:02:17.740 --> 00:02:21.060
superior in Paris. This is where he began taking classes in science.

38
00:02:21.130 --> 00:02:25.930
Chemistry became his new passion and he had the goal of earning his PhD in 1847.

39
00:02:25.931 --> 00:02:29.890
He received his doctorate degree and this set the course for the rest of his

40
00:02:29.891 --> 00:02:30.724
life

41
00:02:36.300 --> 00:02:37.410
While he was earning his PhD.

42
00:02:38.010 --> 00:02:41.770
Louis pastor taught chemistry at secondary school called DeShaw LII before

43
00:02:42.130 --> 00:02:44.720
becoming a research chemist at the university of STRs Borg,

44
00:02:44.721 --> 00:02:46.160
when he was just 25 years old,

45
00:02:46.161 --> 00:02:50.080
he'd already made discoveries that became vital in developing vaccines in the

46
00:02:50.081 --> 00:02:53.960
future microscopes that existed for hundreds of years before Louis pastor was

47
00:02:53.961 --> 00:02:54.300
born.

48
00:02:54.300 --> 00:02:57.680
But new improvements on the machine helped scientists to discover the existence

49
00:02:57.681 --> 00:02:58.720
of microorganisms.

50
00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:02.880
Louis pester was far from the only scientist to be studying microorganisms at

51
00:03:02.881 --> 00:03:05.280
the time, but he was one of the very first,

52
00:03:05.460 --> 00:03:08.880
he is widely considered to be one of the fathers of the field that would later

53
00:03:08.950 --> 00:03:11.720
come to be called microbiology in 1849.

54
00:03:11.880 --> 00:03:14.720
Louis pester was attempting to solve issues that winemakers were having while

55
00:03:14.960 --> 00:03:15.681
fermenting grapes.

56
00:03:15.681 --> 00:03:19.710
Some batches of wine would go sour very quickly while a others would not even

57
00:03:19.950 --> 00:03:22.750
when the ingredients and process were exactly the same.

58
00:03:22.840 --> 00:03:25.990
Every time winemakers could not figure out why this was happening.

59
00:03:26.590 --> 00:03:28.110
Pasture was able to gather tartaric acid,

60
00:03:28.111 --> 00:03:31.230
which is one of the chemicals presence in the sediments of the wine.

61
00:03:31.410 --> 00:03:33.110
During the fermentation process,

62
00:03:33.400 --> 00:03:37.630
after dissolving the tartaric acid pasture was able to pass polarized light

63
00:03:37.631 --> 00:03:39.340
through the sample. In order to of it,

64
00:03:39.400 --> 00:03:44.060
he discovered that there was a nearly identical compound known as para tartaric

65
00:03:44.061 --> 00:03:45.420
acid in the wine sediments.

66
00:03:45.670 --> 00:03:48.700
Every other scientist who had observed the same samples assumed that the

67
00:03:48.780 --> 00:03:52.700
chemical was the same because it has the same composition as tartaric acid.

68
00:03:52.701 --> 00:03:55.500
However, while these molecules seem identical at first,

69
00:03:55.501 --> 00:03:57.820
they are actually mirror images of one another.

70
00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:01.490
You can think of it as either being left to our right-handed versions of the

71
00:04:01.491 --> 00:04:05.090
same chemical with one of them causing the grapes to go sour today.

72
00:04:05.091 --> 00:04:05.924
This process,

73
00:04:06.090 --> 00:04:09.570
the pastor discovered of finding the mirror version of a chemical compound is

74
00:04:09.571 --> 00:04:11.330
known as molecular Chi reality.

75
00:04:11.590 --> 00:04:15.490
And it is actually extremely important in pharmaceutical chemistry because a

76
00:04:15.491 --> 00:04:18.130
left or right-handed version may react completely differently.

77
00:04:18.320 --> 00:04:20.320
Once it is metabolized in the human body,

78
00:04:20.350 --> 00:04:23.880
even though it has the exact same chemical composition, his discovery,

79
00:04:24.160 --> 00:04:27.480
and the variations between the structure and shape of a molecule also led to the

80
00:04:27.481 --> 00:04:32.240
field of stereochemistry with just this one discovery Louis pastor was able to

81
00:04:32.241 --> 00:04:36.440
fix a problem and also pave the way for future scientists in several fields of

82
00:04:36.441 --> 00:04:37.640
chemistry. This alone,

83
00:04:37.641 --> 00:04:40.480
would've been a huge accomplishment that would've put his name down in his

84
00:04:40.950 --> 00:04:44.430
history, but well, he was far from finished with his life's work.

85
00:04:51.030 --> 00:04:52.670
Leo met his future wife, Maria Lauren,

86
00:04:52.740 --> 00:04:56.670
when he was working at the university of STRs bog Murray was the daughter of the

87
00:04:56.990 --> 00:04:59.910
school's rec. So she spent most of her life in an academic environment.

88
00:05:00.010 --> 00:05:03.260
She worked in the school's law Bo and was assigned as Louis pastor's lab

89
00:05:03.261 --> 00:05:04.260
assistant in am.

90
00:05:04.930 --> 00:05:08.540
This is someone who writes down the scientific information and assists in making

91
00:05:08.660 --> 00:05:10.060
sketches of his discoveries.

92
00:05:10.460 --> 00:05:13.060
Marie was a well-educated woman and she would've had a lot of scientific

93
00:05:13.061 --> 00:05:16.300
background knowledge in order for her to understand and record the information.

94
00:05:16.440 --> 00:05:17.900
If she was born in a different time,

95
00:05:17.901 --> 00:05:20.740
there is no doubt that she would've been a full-fledged chemist as well.

96
00:05:21.260 --> 00:05:24.210
French is so art at the time they founded inappropriate for women to become

97
00:05:24.490 --> 00:05:26.850
scientists, but Marie and Louis, they respected one another.

98
00:05:26.870 --> 00:05:29.370
And the two of them were truly devoted to this work.

99
00:05:29.510 --> 00:05:31.890
It only makes sense that they were perfect to one another,

100
00:05:31.891 --> 00:05:34.450
both inside and outside the laboratory.

101
00:05:34.810 --> 00:05:38.250
Louis pasture was 25 years old when he made the discoveries in wine sediments.

102
00:05:38.370 --> 00:05:42.010
And the two of them were able to share the victory of a job well done. The,

103
00:05:42.080 --> 00:05:44.080
this would only be the beginning of their teamwork.

104
00:05:44.340 --> 00:05:46.800
The two were married on may the 29th, 1849.

105
00:05:47.160 --> 00:05:51.160
Louis pastor was 26 and Marie was 23. As the years, went on,

106
00:05:51.400 --> 00:05:54.800
Marie continued to assist Louis in his experiments without her knowledge and

107
00:05:54.801 --> 00:05:56.280
professionalism. By his side,

108
00:05:56.281 --> 00:05:59.280
he may not have been able to accomplish as much as he did in his career.

109
00:05:59.510 --> 00:06:01.280
They went on to have five children together,

110
00:06:01.500 --> 00:06:04.640
but tragically only two would survive childhood as parents.

111
00:06:04.641 --> 00:06:05.474
He lost three children.

112
00:06:05.590 --> 00:06:09.560
They knew the pain that all parents feel when their children die from a disease

113
00:06:09.561 --> 00:06:10.520
that could have been prevented.

114
00:06:10.820 --> 00:06:13.640
If only there had been a vaccine that existed to help them.

115
00:06:13.780 --> 00:06:16.440
The two of them became determined to devote their careers,

116
00:06:16.610 --> 00:06:18.070
to saving the lives of other children.

117
00:06:18.250 --> 00:06:21.270
And they were eventually able to accomplish just that. Now,

118
00:06:21.271 --> 00:06:24.910
just before we get into the thing that pastor is most famous for now is a

119
00:06:24.911 --> 00:06:27.990
perfect time for me to tell you about today's sponsored brilliance,

120
00:06:27.991 --> 00:06:31.190
these longer videos that really made possible because of sponsors like

121
00:06:31.191 --> 00:06:33.590
brilliant. So I'd love it. If you had a moment just to check them out,

122
00:06:33.591 --> 00:06:35.350
when you're done watching this video, you're doing that.

123
00:06:35.351 --> 00:06:39.340
It really does allow us to keep doing what we do here at biographics.

124
00:06:39.341 --> 00:06:42.900
And you know, you are watching a 20 minute video on YouTube without a scientist.

125
00:06:42.901 --> 00:06:46.860
So educational content like brilliance is probably something you're gonna be

126
00:06:46.861 --> 00:06:49.580
into brilliance are a science and learning platform that allow you to learn

127
00:06:49.581 --> 00:06:50.540
through active learning,

128
00:06:50.541 --> 00:06:53.860
which summed up is basically the opposite of reading a really complex paragraph

129
00:06:53.861 --> 00:06:56.900
about some principle, and then having no idea what an earth it's about,

130
00:06:56.901 --> 00:07:00.730
even though you've it through like 17 times, yes. Still don't get it.

131
00:07:00.731 --> 00:07:04.250
It's not just me. Now, if you regularly tune in for these biographics videos,

132
00:07:04.280 --> 00:07:06.770
then you know that brilliant are often a sponsor,

133
00:07:06.790 --> 00:07:08.890
but they've recently added something new to their app.

134
00:07:09.030 --> 00:07:11.450
All of their courses can now be accessed offline.

135
00:07:11.470 --> 00:07:15.050
So you don't have to worry about having a solid internet connection or using up

136
00:07:15.051 --> 00:07:17.970
your data to go through their courses. Now, maybe that be,

137
00:07:18.360 --> 00:07:20.160
you can spend your commute learning something new,

138
00:07:20.340 --> 00:07:24.800
or indeed you can just be guaranteed to be able to learn something wherever you

139
00:07:24.801 --> 00:07:27.680
are brilliant. It makes even complex concepts easy. As you understand,

140
00:07:27.710 --> 00:07:31.880
they give you something super short to read and then you immediately apply it to

141
00:07:31.881 --> 00:07:32.161
a problem.

142
00:07:32.161 --> 00:07:35.480
And basically you just rinse and repeat that there's loads of these ones that

143
00:07:35.481 --> 00:07:40.110
you go through, all kind of progressing along until you mastered a subject.

144
00:07:40.610 --> 00:07:42.230
All the courses are totally interactive.

145
00:07:42.250 --> 00:07:46.230
So you can learn probability by playing a game of blackjack or learn the physics

146
00:07:46.290 --> 00:07:49.270
of motion using interactive models of pendulum clocks.

147
00:07:49.330 --> 00:07:53.230
So if you want to support biographics and get unlimited access to all of

148
00:07:53.231 --> 00:07:57.750

151
00:08:05.420 --> 00:08:06.260
And let's get back to pastor

152
00:08:12.680 --> 00:08:14.580
Before he could begin studying diseases.

153
00:08:14.780 --> 00:08:17.820
Louis pastor still needed to do the scientific research that was paying the

154
00:08:17.821 --> 00:08:21.890
bills. In 1854, pastor became a chemistry professor at the university of Lil.

155
00:08:21.990 --> 00:08:25.370
He was paid to continue researching issues in alcohol manufacturing.

156
00:08:25.470 --> 00:08:29.290
He became the Dean of the science department as well and helped to mentor the

157
00:08:29.291 --> 00:08:32.810
rest of the faculty in 1861, pastor discovered ABI,

158
00:08:33.140 --> 00:08:37.530
which is crucial in understanding how yeast and sugar formed alcohol during the

159
00:08:37.650 --> 00:08:38.483
fermentation process,

160
00:08:38.520 --> 00:08:42.240
even though fermentation had going on for thousands of years of human history,

161
00:08:42.340 --> 00:08:46.160
no one else had been able to explain the how and why of the chemical process.

162
00:08:46.540 --> 00:08:48.760
So today, yes, everyone running some hipster,

163
00:08:48.761 --> 00:08:52.840
micro brewery has Louis pastor to thank for their careers, making craft beer.

164
00:08:52.990 --> 00:08:55.080
Once he fully understood the fermentation process.

165
00:08:55.880 --> 00:09:00.880
Pasta had a theory that these invisible organisms called germs and bacteria were

166
00:09:00.881 --> 00:09:04.160
responsible for causing wine, beer and milk to go sour.

167
00:09:04.420 --> 00:09:06.320
He proved that by boiling these liquids,

168
00:09:06.321 --> 00:09:09.560
he could kill the bacteria and then cool it to make it drinkable. Again.

169
00:09:09.740 --> 00:09:13.480
The first successful test was completed on April the 20th, 1862,

170
00:09:13.630 --> 00:09:16.470
that process of eating and cooling it was named after him.

171
00:09:16.471 --> 00:09:18.390
So it was known as pasteurization.

172
00:09:18.810 --> 00:09:21.710
And it is a process that is still used today.

173
00:09:22.230 --> 00:09:25.910
Louis pastor was able to move on from the food industry and begin studying

174
00:09:25.911 --> 00:09:28.390
disease, which had been his goal in 1865.

175
00:09:28.391 --> 00:09:31.350
He was able to prove that microbes were causing a disease that destroyed

176
00:09:31.351 --> 00:09:32.750
silkworm eggs. His wife,

177
00:09:33.070 --> 00:09:35.620
Maria assisted him in growing the silkworms and keeping them alive.

178
00:09:35.621 --> 00:09:36.980
During the course of the experiment,

179
00:09:37.120 --> 00:09:41.340
he was able to develop a prevention for contamination and saved the silk making

180
00:09:41.660 --> 00:09:44.700
industry around the world. So aside from our clean wine and beer,

181
00:09:45.000 --> 00:09:48.940
we also need to thank him for our fancy silk robes and pajamas.

182
00:09:49.130 --> 00:09:51.860
Once he was beginning to understand how bacteria caused illness,

183
00:09:51.861 --> 00:09:55.260
he was beginning to come up with his germ theory for the majority of human

184
00:09:55.420 --> 00:09:59.090
history. People did not know about the existence of germs and they did not fully

185
00:09:59.100 --> 00:10:03.930
understand the immune system. The widely held belief was the, my theory,

186
00:10:03.931 --> 00:10:08.690
which was that diseases caused by a poisonous vapor in the air that only came

187
00:10:08.691 --> 00:10:11.770
out at night. &lt;laugh&gt; yes,

188
00:10:11.771 --> 00:10:15.690
it does sound a bit ridiculous in retrospect, but people had absolutely no,

189
00:10:15.770 --> 00:10:19.960
I idea how or why human beings contracted illnesses in hospitals,

190
00:10:19.961 --> 00:10:23.360
doctors and nurses never even bothered to wash their hands because they truly

191
00:10:23.380 --> 00:10:26.800
did not understand the spread of human disease, human waste.

192
00:10:26.801 --> 00:10:28.720
It would sometimes make its way into the water system,

193
00:10:28.721 --> 00:10:31.280
which would trigger huge outbreaks of infectious disease.

194
00:10:31.760 --> 00:10:34.680
All because people did not understand that germs existed.

195
00:10:34.770 --> 00:10:38.150
Other scientists had proposed to germ theory long before Louis pastor,

196
00:10:38.550 --> 00:10:39.990
but it was often dismissed.

197
00:10:39.990 --> 00:10:44.430
People had believed in my asthma theory for so long that it had just become the

198
00:10:44.431 --> 00:10:47.150
truth in England, a scientist named Dr. John Snow,

199
00:10:47.210 --> 00:10:49.590
not to be confused with the character from game of Thrones,

200
00:10:49.591 --> 00:10:54.350
there was able to save London from the collar outbreak by convincing the town to

201
00:10:54.351 --> 00:10:57.580
shut down a water pump that had been infected by human waste there,

202
00:10:57.820 --> 00:11:00.900
pastor would've probably read about snow's breakthrough and bacterial research,

203
00:11:01.040 --> 00:11:04.540
and it would inspire him to push gem theory as well. Soon enough,

204
00:11:04.541 --> 00:11:08.340
pastor and the other fathers of microbiology were able to prove that the,

205
00:11:08.341 --> 00:11:13.100
my asthma theory was nothing but a fantasy and the acknowledgement that germs

206
00:11:13.101 --> 00:11:16.620
existed, it would change the medical industry. As we know it

207
00:11:22.870 --> 00:11:23.850
In 1868,

208
00:11:24.170 --> 00:11:28.090
Louis pastor was just 46 years old when he suffered a severe stroke and he

209
00:11:28.091 --> 00:11:31.090
became partially paralyzed. Instead of going to a hospital,

210
00:11:31.730 --> 00:11:32.970
Pastora was treated in his home.

211
00:11:33.080 --> 00:11:36.570
16 leaches were placed behind his ears to clear the bloods that had pulled

212
00:11:36.571 --> 00:11:40.280
around his cerebral hemorrhage. After the doctor left with leaches,

213
00:11:40.520 --> 00:11:42.720
Louis pastor was left with his wife, Marie.

214
00:11:42.980 --> 00:11:46.680
He was very lucky that she had such an extensive science backgrounds because she

215
00:11:46.681 --> 00:11:49.680
helped to rehabilitate him. And he overcame as paralysis.

216
00:11:49.790 --> 00:11:53.400
This story is usually glossed over in many of the history books.

217
00:11:53.500 --> 00:11:57.240
We tend to glorify the major accomplishments of successful people and ignore the

218
00:11:57.440 --> 00:11:58.440
struggles Louis pastor.

219
00:11:58.780 --> 00:12:02.720
He was still a human and recovering from a stroke is never an easy task.

220
00:12:03.150 --> 00:12:04.400
Back in the 18 hundreds,

221
00:12:04.440 --> 00:12:07.920
a stroke would likely mean death or permanent paralysis for the rest of his

222
00:12:07.921 --> 00:12:08.640
life.

223
00:12:08.640 --> 00:12:11.520
Maureen nursed him back to health and encouraged him to heal so that they could

224
00:12:11.521 --> 00:12:16.230
both returns look laboratory and continue their life's work of curing diseases.

225
00:12:16.380 --> 00:12:17.590
Even though it's health recovered,

226
00:12:17.591 --> 00:12:21.750
it would be years before Louis pastor was able to make another major scientific

227
00:12:21.751 --> 00:12:23.710
discovery. It was eight years later.

228
00:12:24.150 --> 00:12:28.110
The pastor made his first major breakthrough since having a stroke at the time.

229
00:12:28.430 --> 00:12:32.070
Scientists believed in the idea of spontaneous generation.

230
00:12:32.220 --> 00:12:36.460
This is the notion that living creatures could spontaneously generate from

231
00:12:36.610 --> 00:12:39.860
inanimate substances. People believe that living creatures were born.

232
00:12:40.170 --> 00:12:44.580
Asexually like mice forming in rotting, food and frogs emerging from the mut.

233
00:12:45.170 --> 00:12:48.380
This belief was so common that there were even some scientific papers claiming

234
00:12:48.440 --> 00:12:53.060
to come up with a recipe for growing your own mice pastor publicly denounced the

235
00:12:53.260 --> 00:12:55.370
age old belief of spontaneous generation,

236
00:12:55.371 --> 00:12:58.290
but there were still plenty of people who had their doubts in the past.

237
00:12:58.290 --> 00:13:00.330
Other scientists like Francisco ready,

238
00:13:00.430 --> 00:13:03.690
had attempted to prove that spontaneous generation was not real.

239
00:13:03.870 --> 00:13:05.810
He sealed a piece of meat and a jar with a lid,

240
00:13:05.811 --> 00:13:10.050
proving that as long as flies did not land on the food lava did not appear.

241
00:13:10.051 --> 00:13:10.491
However,

242
00:13:10.491 --> 00:13:14.480
people did not believe this because they thought oxygen maybe necessary for the

243
00:13:14.481 --> 00:13:15.314
so-called recipe.

244
00:13:15.580 --> 00:13:19.920
The only way pastor was able to convince the public that animals are not born

245
00:13:20.280 --> 00:13:20.940
outta food,

246
00:13:20.940 --> 00:13:25.240
was to design custom Swan neck bottles that curved in such a way that allowed

247
00:13:25.241 --> 00:13:29.000
oxygen to get through, but it would be impossible for flies to crawl inside.

248
00:13:29.140 --> 00:13:32.680
He boiled a beef broth and left it inside the Swan neck bottle. Finally,

249
00:13:33.070 --> 00:13:36.790
with that, the idea of spontaneous generation was debunked.

250
00:13:37.130 --> 00:13:40.230
Two years later in 1878, Pastora was studying diseases.

251
00:13:40.231 --> 00:13:44.310
When he accidentally exposed chickens to an attenuated culture of chicken

252
00:13:44.910 --> 00:13:47.870
cholera, however, the chickens did not die from the disease. In fact,

253
00:13:48.010 --> 00:13:51.750
it had the exact opposite effect when they were later exposed to the full

254
00:13:51.751 --> 00:13:54.150
fledged chicken chole of virus, they had become immune.

255
00:13:54.380 --> 00:13:58.100
This was Louis pastor's very first vaccine at the time,

256
00:13:58.160 --> 00:14:01.940
the idea that he could replicate these results in human beings was still years

257
00:14:01.970 --> 00:14:03.260
away from actually happening.

258
00:14:03.360 --> 00:14:06.580
But he theorized that if he could replicate that same process,

259
00:14:06.960 --> 00:14:11.500
he may be able to create vaccines for some of the deadliest diseases of the time

260
00:14:11.690 --> 00:14:16.530
like anthrax, tuberculosis, and small parks. A year later in 1881,

261
00:14:16.730 --> 00:14:20.970
Lou pastor developed a vaccine for anx good several sheep in his laboratory from

262
00:14:20.971 --> 00:14:24.250
the disease, even after conducting the same experiment, hundreds of times,

263
00:14:24.570 --> 00:14:28.450
the scientific community still did not believe in Louie pastor's results.

264
00:14:28.560 --> 00:14:30.490
Even when everyone marked and ridiculed him,

265
00:14:30.630 --> 00:14:34.330
he did not back down because he knew that he was right for years.

266
00:14:34.331 --> 00:14:37.600
People refused to believe him until to the town of per LA four,

267
00:14:37.601 --> 00:14:40.920
which had a farm filled with sheep that had been infected with anthrax.

268
00:14:41.240 --> 00:14:44.760
Pastor injected his vaccine to all of the six sheep in front of a large crowd of

269
00:14:44.761 --> 00:14:45.760
people. Sure enough,

270
00:14:45.761 --> 00:14:49.880
all of the sheep recovered and the newspapers finally declared that he truly had

271
00:14:49.881 --> 00:14:50.714
invented the cure.

272
00:14:50.740 --> 00:14:54.960
He once wrote this advice to future generations on how to deal with haters,

273
00:14:55.140 --> 00:14:59.120
do not let yourself be tainted with a Barron skepticism.

274
00:14:59.370 --> 00:15:02.320
After Louis pastor's jam theory was published in academic papers.

275
00:15:02.321 --> 00:15:05.640
There was a significant amount of proof that his animal vaccines were working

276
00:15:05.960 --> 00:15:06.521
educated.

277
00:15:06.521 --> 00:15:11.150
People with open minds understood the concept of bacteria and they make efforts

278
00:15:11.151 --> 00:15:13.870
to improve public health and safety in France.

279
00:15:13.940 --> 00:15:16.470
Following Louis pasture's discovery about germs,

280
00:15:16.471 --> 00:15:20.990
a politician named UEN puel began enforcing the first garbage cans in Paris in

281
00:15:21.110 --> 00:15:21.943
1884.

282
00:15:21.950 --> 00:15:24.990
At first citizens were outraged that they could no longer just throw their trash

283
00:15:25.230 --> 00:15:25.980
wherever they wanted,

284
00:15:25.980 --> 00:15:29.110
despite dealing with all of the skepticism and push back from the public.

285
00:15:29.710 --> 00:15:34.340
Puel continued to mandate that garbage cans were necessary in every home today.

286
00:15:34.341 --> 00:15:35.780
We take garbage cans for granted,

287
00:15:35.781 --> 00:15:39.460
but this was a huge step in disease prevention. Over the next few years,

288
00:15:39.560 --> 00:15:43.140
the spread of disease began to fall dramatically in France and other countries

289
00:15:43.141 --> 00:15:45.460
around the world began to copy the idea. However,

290
00:15:45.650 --> 00:15:49.540
just like every other scientific discovery and human history,

291
00:15:49.590 --> 00:15:52.930
there were still people who refused to in the germ theory,

292
00:15:53.610 --> 00:15:55.170
despite all of the proof that was out there.

293
00:15:55.171 --> 00:15:58.970
Pastor had plenty of critics who still trying to claim that he was incorrect.

294
00:15:59.410 --> 00:16:03.570
Louis pastor had a bitter rivalry with another scientist named Anto Biamp who

295
00:16:03.580 --> 00:16:07.570
completely dismissed his germ theory instead of believing in the existence of

296
00:16:07.770 --> 00:16:10.970
germs, Biamp published his own theory of Cleo morphism,

297
00:16:11.190 --> 00:16:13.920
but of course the truth always has a way of coming out.

298
00:16:13.940 --> 00:16:17.040
And pastor continued to be the one who came out on top.

299
00:16:23.480 --> 00:16:26.760
Louis Aster continued to prove to the world that his germ theory was correct.

300
00:16:26.820 --> 00:16:29.360
And that infections were the cause of disease at the time.

301
00:16:29.960 --> 00:16:32.360
Rabies and anthrax were both very serious problems in animals.

302
00:16:32.570 --> 00:16:34.390
If a dog was infected and bit someone,

303
00:16:34.570 --> 00:16:39.070
it was guaranteed that they would die an excruciatingly painful death after

304
00:16:39.071 --> 00:16:41.550
years of overcoming so much doubt in the scientific community.

305
00:16:41.910 --> 00:16:45.750
Louis pastor was now well regarded for his achievements in science and medicine

306
00:16:45.890 --> 00:16:46.950
in 1873,

307
00:16:47.010 --> 00:16:50.870
the academy to medicine elected to bring him on as an associate member of the

308
00:16:50.871 --> 00:16:54.540
society. Then in 1882, it was into the academy for say,

309
00:16:54.670 --> 00:16:56.260
while he was doing research there,

310
00:16:56.320 --> 00:17:00.620
he decided to devote his research to curing rabies. In 1883,

311
00:17:00.621 --> 00:17:04.060
pastor was creating the rabies vaccine by acquiring rabbits that had been

312
00:17:04.220 --> 00:17:07.620
infected by the virus and attempting to inject that vaccine into doc,

313
00:17:07.750 --> 00:17:08.820
after trial and error,

314
00:17:08.880 --> 00:17:12.260
he was able to cure dogs who had been infected and bring them back to health.

315
00:17:12.400 --> 00:17:13.233
But using the vaccine,

316
00:17:13.570 --> 00:17:17.610
human being had not been done until 1885 on July the sixth,

317
00:17:17.611 --> 00:17:21.370
the nine year old boy named Joseph Meister was brought to Louis pastor in Paris.

318
00:17:21.510 --> 00:17:25.170
His parents had traveled for two days from AAS after he was bitten by a rabbit

319
00:17:25.310 --> 00:17:28.890
dog at first Pastora hesitated because he had only ever experimented with the

320
00:17:28.891 --> 00:17:33.610
vaccine on docs, but the boy was going to die anyway. So fester agreed to try.

321
00:17:33.750 --> 00:17:37.560
He gonna mul from the spinal cord of a rabbit who had rabies and formed a

322
00:17:37.561 --> 00:17:40.560
vaccine. The process did not happen overnight. Over the next 10 days,

323
00:17:40.561 --> 00:17:44.360
Joseph was given 13 more injections of the vaccine and he was hospitalized for

324
00:17:44.361 --> 00:17:46.720
three months after the boy made a full recovery.

325
00:17:47.200 --> 00:17:51.920
Louis pastor became famous around the world for finding the cure on the 20th of

326
00:17:51.920 --> 00:17:52.110
October,

327
00:17:52.110 --> 00:17:55.480
that same year an adult male who had been infected with rabies six days earlier,

328
00:17:55.580 --> 00:17:59.280
was brought to Louis pastor. He repeated the same vaccination process as before,

329
00:17:59.281 --> 00:18:01.120
and the man made a full recovery. Now,

330
00:18:01.121 --> 00:18:04.480
there was no doubt that the vaccine truly worked in 1886.

331
00:18:04.680 --> 00:18:08.750
Louis pastor began to treat over 350 patients who had been infected with Rab in

332
00:18:08.751 --> 00:18:11.150
Europe and the United States, Louis pastor's wife,

333
00:18:11.151 --> 00:18:14.870
Marie traveled the world with him and nursed the sick children with rabies for a

334
00:18:14.871 --> 00:18:18.910
few months at a time while her husband was preparing the vaccines and giving the

335
00:18:18.911 --> 00:18:20.510
injections. Of course today,

336
00:18:20.790 --> 00:18:24.230
this same vaccine is what helps keep our dogs in counts, safe from rabies,

337
00:18:24.410 --> 00:18:27.590
no matter where he went, whether he could speak the language or not.

338
00:18:27.890 --> 00:18:29.740
The story was all always the same.

339
00:18:29.920 --> 00:18:33.900
He was very proud that he was able to accomplish this on behalf of France.

340
00:18:33.960 --> 00:18:37.860
He said, science knows no country because knowledge belongs to humanity.

341
00:18:38.120 --> 00:18:40.260
And is the torch, which illuminates the world.

342
00:18:40.490 --> 00:18:44.620
Science is the highest personification of the nation because that nation will

343
00:18:44.621 --> 00:18:47.820
remain the first, which carries the furthest, that works of thought.

344
00:18:48.080 --> 00:18:52.170
And in intelligence during this process of meeting healing over 350 people,

345
00:18:52.171 --> 00:18:54.090
pastor got to know many of his patients,

346
00:18:54.200 --> 00:18:57.170
many of them were young children who were Biten while playing with their dogs.

347
00:18:57.390 --> 00:18:59.050
He said, when I approached a child,

348
00:18:59.310 --> 00:19:03.930
he inspires in the two sentiments tenderness for what he is and

349
00:19:03.931 --> 00:19:05.650
respect for what he may become.

350
00:19:06.290 --> 00:19:09.850
Lou pastor wanted to save the lives of these sick children so that they could

351
00:19:09.851 --> 00:19:11.000
have a chance to grow up.

352
00:19:11.001 --> 00:19:15.360
And he wanted his vaccines to do the same for future generations all over the

353
00:19:15.361 --> 00:19:16.320
world. Finally,

354
00:19:16.380 --> 00:19:20.200
he was recognized as a scientist worthy of his own research facility and a

355
00:19:20.320 --> 00:19:23.880
fundraising campaign began to create the pastor Institute in Paris.

356
00:19:24.030 --> 00:19:28.360
This was finally an on November, the 14th, 1888. When he turned 70,

357
00:19:28.500 --> 00:19:31.990
he was given a spectacular birthday by party at the university of Paris.

358
00:19:32.010 --> 00:19:35.510
And some of the most prestigious doctors and scientists that were in the world

359
00:19:35.860 --> 00:19:37.990
came to celebrate his life. And his works,

360
00:19:38.470 --> 00:19:41.870
Lou pastor died in 1895 at the age of 73.

361
00:19:42.010 --> 00:19:45.790
His body is now an crypt at the pastor Institute, but his work,

362
00:19:45.970 --> 00:19:48.630
it has lived on far after his passing today.

363
00:19:48.690 --> 00:19:52.580
We still use pasteurization in the food history and his breakthroughs in

364
00:19:52.740 --> 00:19:54.500
medicine. They were just the beginning.

365
00:19:54.510 --> 00:19:58.620
Other scientists began to use the same methods to create vaccines for diseases

366
00:19:58.621 --> 00:20:01.100
that had once killed thousands of people. There is no telling,

367
00:20:01.101 --> 00:20:05.580
just too many millions of people would've died without the work that he was able

368
00:20:05.960 --> 00:20:10.500
to accomplish. So I really hope you found that video interesting and inspiring.
