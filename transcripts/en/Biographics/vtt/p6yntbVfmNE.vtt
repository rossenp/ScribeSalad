Vivion that sounded more French. When you hear the words, Mexican revolution,

8
00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:32.750
which historical figure do you immediately picture?

9
00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:37.430
We're guessing it's Pancho the sombrero wearing gun.

10
00:00:37.610 --> 00:00:39.510
Toting Robin hood bandit,

11
00:00:39.670 --> 00:00:44.140
who infamously the town of Columbus New Mexico in 1916,

12
00:00:44.660 --> 00:00:47.540
Bal via is the revolutionary who gets all the press.

13
00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:50.220
He was far from the most respected,

14
00:00:50.530 --> 00:00:54.340
most influential or even most interesting. Nope. That honor,

15
00:00:54.490 --> 00:00:59.460
instead goes to a Machio horse trainer from the impoverished state of morale

16
00:01:00.100 --> 00:01:03.890
Soman who began his life with was nothing and wound up reshaping.

17
00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:05.250
The whole of Mexico.

18
00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:10.650
That revolutionary name Eliana is a pat born in a small village during the

19
00:01:10.651 --> 00:01:15.490
heyday of the PFU and dictatorship Zapata's life should have passed in blisful

20
00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:20.090
obscurity yet a combination of circumstance and timing wound up thrusting him

21
00:01:20.160 --> 00:01:25.080
into the spotlight just a as Mexico exploded an uncompromising supporter of

22
00:01:25.081 --> 00:01:26.080
land rights for the poor,

23
00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:31.360
a general capable of conquering Mexico city and a tragic folk hero who died

24
00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:32.213
for his cause.

25
00:01:32.270 --> 00:01:36.840
This is the story of Mexico's greatest revolutionary

26
00:01:43.090 --> 00:01:45.750
For a man identified so closely with revolution.

27
00:01:45.820 --> 00:01:50.670
It's a mild historical irony that AME ZPA was born just as the

28
00:01:50.830 --> 00:01:54.750
greatest period of Mexican upheaval ended in eighteen seventy six,

29
00:01:54.750 --> 00:01:56.150
three years before Zapata's birth.

30
00:01:56.410 --> 00:01:59.910
The decades of unrest that had followed independence came to a close when

31
00:01:59.911 --> 00:02:04.700
general porphyria Diaz seized the pre uttering in a long period

32
00:02:04.960 --> 00:02:08.500
of stability and growth known as the Prato.

33
00:02:08.680 --> 00:02:13.660
But don't go thinking that stable means popular. The Prato was a dictatorship.

34
00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:15.100
The elections were rigged.

35
00:02:15.101 --> 00:02:19.380
Dissent was crushed and the lower classes were locked out of power and nowhere

36
00:02:19.381 --> 00:02:21.780
suffered under DSS, perfumed boot,

37
00:02:22.130 --> 00:02:26.370
more than Zapatas state of Morales in 1879.

38
00:02:26.390 --> 00:02:29.850
The year of Zapata's birth Morales was Mexico's newest state,

39
00:02:30.180 --> 00:02:34.170
small blob of mountainous terrain, not a hundred kilometers from Mexico city.

40
00:02:34.310 --> 00:02:39.210
It was also one of the poorest seriously Morales's major commodity was dirt,

41
00:02:39.211 --> 00:02:41.810
poor peasants, farming, dirt, poor lands,

42
00:02:41.950 --> 00:02:46.760
and this poor quality dirt was about to cause a massive problem for generations.

43
00:02:46.820 --> 00:02:51.120
The villages in such relies on communal land to produce enough crops to avoid

44
00:02:51.170 --> 00:02:54.040
starvation, but now porphyria was empowered.

45
00:02:54.220 --> 00:02:56.920
He couldn't care less about communal land rights.

46
00:02:57.010 --> 00:03:01.080
While the porphyria turned a blind eye, wealthy land owners known as has,

47
00:03:01.320 --> 00:03:05.440
and dados started aggressively occupying communal land in Morells.

48
00:03:05.510 --> 00:03:10.200
This is actually a story it's probably apocryphal that when the millions of pat

49
00:03:10.260 --> 00:03:14.160
was just nine, he witnessed his father Bri down, crying after a has,

50
00:03:14.320 --> 00:03:17.480
and Dardo fenced off. And, or at first the villages of Mars,

51
00:03:17.481 --> 00:03:21.070
they tried to fight by they petitioned officials. They staged protests.

52
00:03:21.071 --> 00:03:22.750
They even tried to hire lawyers,

53
00:03:23.010 --> 00:03:27.950
but the PTO was propped up by the same people stealing their land as well.

54
00:03:27.951 --> 00:03:32.710
What was POY di gonna do arrest the has and Datos keeping him in power falls of

55
00:03:32.870 --> 00:03:36.110
powder. Growing up in mores meant growing up in a world where has,

56
00:03:36.270 --> 00:03:38.950
and DAS could not just steal lands without consequent,

57
00:03:39.860 --> 00:03:41.740
but they could kill anyone who got in their way.

58
00:03:41.850 --> 00:03:46.180
There's a famous story about one village lawyer who took his case against DHA.

59
00:03:46.740 --> 00:03:50.260
Dardo all the way toy ideas himself Diaz shook the guy's hands,

60
00:03:50.370 --> 00:03:53.740
told him he'd look into it and then had the lawyer thrown into a labor camp.

61
00:03:54.040 --> 00:03:59.020
And that's where things stood ins just before the Mexican revolution broke out a

62
00:03:59.021 --> 00:04:01.090
bunch of voiceless off peasants,

63
00:04:01.240 --> 00:04:05.170
desperately crying for a leader to stand up for their rights.

64
00:04:05.320 --> 00:04:08.890
Luckily for them Milanas a pat was about to answer that. Cool.

65
00:04:15.070 --> 00:04:19.010
So that's the world as a pattern inhabited, but what about the man himself?

66
00:04:19.230 --> 00:04:22.720
Who was the, a guy who was about to fight fors?

67
00:04:23.240 --> 00:04:25.320
And the honor Zapata was born on August the eighth,

68
00:04:25.600 --> 00:04:28.040
1879 in the village of an Akeo,

69
00:04:28.150 --> 00:04:32.880
just one of the many's villages, losing vital lands the house in dartos,

70
00:04:32.900 --> 00:04:36.680
but it was Zapata's village was dirt poor. The man himself was not.

71
00:04:36.820 --> 00:04:40.160
The family Zapata was born into was actually kind of doing okay,

72
00:04:40.650 --> 00:04:42.790
at least by Mexican peasant standards.

73
00:04:43.070 --> 00:04:46.830
They had one of the biggest houses in the village and Zapata's father was a

74
00:04:46.831 --> 00:04:51.030
respected horse trainer. This career, it evidently rubbed off on the young land.

75
00:04:51.031 --> 00:04:52.150
And by the time he was a teenager,

76
00:04:52.750 --> 00:04:57.550
Zapata was one of the best horse trainers in Mors with even the Hasen datas

77
00:04:57.551 --> 00:05:00.910
after his expertise, this would turn out to be a very useful,

78
00:05:01.300 --> 00:05:03.900
great to have not long after Zapata turn 17.

79
00:05:03.970 --> 00:05:06.940
Both his parents unfortunately died the following year,

80
00:05:07.220 --> 00:05:11.820
1897 Z pat took part in a land rights protest and was arrested and

81
00:05:11.821 --> 00:05:15.820
drafted into the pian army. But when he was discharged, six months later,

82
00:05:16.160 --> 00:05:19.980
it wasn't into poverty with Zapata, senior dead and Zapata in the army.

83
00:05:20.540 --> 00:05:25.370
The super rich hasn't had become super desperate for a great horse trader and

84
00:05:25.730 --> 00:05:29.890
NAZA powder was back. They were willing to pay big bucks, Foz powder.

85
00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:33.410
This was almost like being gifted, a bottomless piggy bank.

86
00:05:33.630 --> 00:05:35.730
He competed in races in rodeos.

87
00:05:35.930 --> 00:05:39.730
He Hawk his skills to whoever could afford them while he certainly never got

88
00:05:39.760 --> 00:05:43.560
rich. He did get K not poor, not poor enough to afford,

89
00:05:43.700 --> 00:05:44.800
not just fancy clothes,

90
00:05:44.940 --> 00:05:49.640
but also the bucket loads of wax that presumably took to maintain his

91
00:05:49.641 --> 00:05:53.040
glorious mustache as about's local fame group.

92
00:05:53.180 --> 00:05:55.000
So did his interest in politics,

93
00:05:55.600 --> 00:05:59.560
a possibly fake story about Zapata watching his father weep over and enclosed

94
00:05:59.561 --> 00:06:04.040
orchard? Well, Zapata certainly seems to have remembered it because in 1906,

95
00:06:04.041 --> 00:06:08.560
he began sitting in on village meetings about how to stop has dollars being such

96
00:06:08.750 --> 00:06:11.720
land stealing by 19 0 8,

97
00:06:11.720 --> 00:06:15.560
20 5% of all land ins was owned by a near 17 families.

98
00:06:15.690 --> 00:06:20.630
Given that the 75% was mostly low quality stuff that those families didn't want.

99
00:06:20.980 --> 00:06:23.190
This was a serious issue,

100
00:06:23.250 --> 00:06:27.750
but Zapata wasn't ready to pick up a gun and fight to make things fairer.

101
00:06:27.980 --> 00:06:29.150
This was 1908.

102
00:06:29.210 --> 00:06:33.910
The POY had stood for 32 years so long that revolting against it

103
00:06:33.940 --> 00:06:37.780
just seemed impossible. Yet. 90 0 8 was a, also the year.

104
00:06:37.840 --> 00:06:42.700
The foundations of the por fury would be destroyed by an unlikely

105
00:06:42.701 --> 00:06:46.380
source. And that source was porphyria Diaz himself.

106
00:06:52.560 --> 00:06:56.820
If you've ever accidentally blurted something else only to immediately regret it

107
00:06:56.970 --> 00:07:00.050
just no, there's no way you've ever regretted it.

108
00:07:00.190 --> 00:07:04.610
As much as porphyria Diaz in 1908 Diaz gave an interview to the American

109
00:07:04.611 --> 00:07:06.330
journalist James Kilman.

110
00:07:06.520 --> 00:07:10.970
That was supposed to be full of softball questions that Kilman could then write

111
00:07:10.990 --> 00:07:14.330
up into a vomit inducing puff piece. Unfortunately,

112
00:07:15.050 --> 00:07:19.560
Kilman just happened to ask what would happen when Diaz in his seventies became

113
00:07:19.660 --> 00:07:21.640
too old to run Mexico. It's here.

114
00:07:21.880 --> 00:07:24.080
That Diaz didn't just stick his foot in his mouth,

115
00:07:24.380 --> 00:07:27.320
but he practically swallowed his own legs.

116
00:07:27.830 --> 00:07:30.480
Diaz declared that Mexico would become a democracy.

117
00:07:30.940 --> 00:07:35.840
He said that he would step down in 1910 and allow a fair election to choose his

118
00:07:35.870 --> 00:07:36.703
successor.

119
00:07:36.750 --> 00:07:40.630
I've waited patiently for the day when people of the Mexican Republic would be

120
00:07:40.870 --> 00:07:43.470
prepared to choose and change their government at every election.

121
00:07:44.310 --> 00:07:46.550
I believe that day has come. Now,

122
00:07:46.660 --> 00:07:49.830
this was all just the highest grade of cattle done.

123
00:07:49.980 --> 00:07:53.790
Diaz just wanted to sound good tore men's American readers,

124
00:07:53.850 --> 00:07:57.230
but Diaz forgot to tell anyone in Mexico that he was lying.

125
00:07:57.231 --> 00:08:01.700
So in the interview was published in Fe 1908. Everyone was suddenly all like,

126
00:08:02.000 --> 00:08:06.940
is this for real to which PFU ideas basically replies? Uh, yeah. Well,

127
00:08:06.980 --> 00:08:07.813
I mean, I guess,

128
00:08:08.200 --> 00:08:12.980
and so began the slow implosion of the PFU down in Morales

129
00:08:13.260 --> 00:08:16.980
in Emiliana was one of those looking to test years' word.

130
00:08:17.160 --> 00:08:21.410
The state governor had just died and local elite said put in a Jack to replace

131
00:08:21.411 --> 00:08:25.090
him. So as a pattern and some other village leaders decided to run their own

132
00:08:25.091 --> 00:08:28.570
candidate. If Diaz was for real, he'd let them campaign.

133
00:08:28.750 --> 00:08:31.330
And he did do everyone surprise ZPA,

134
00:08:31.390 --> 00:08:33.890
and the others were able to travel to Morales,

135
00:08:33.930 --> 00:08:36.730
drumming up support for their guy. This meant so pattern,

136
00:08:36.731 --> 00:08:41.000
meaning many of the movers and shakers in other villagers and getting his name

137
00:08:41.001 --> 00:08:44.000
out across the state, along with his candidates come,

138
00:08:44.160 --> 00:08:46.400
the more election in February,

139
00:08:46.400 --> 00:08:50.920
1909 as the batters group were certain they would win. But well, no.

140
00:08:51.060 --> 00:08:51.893
At the last moment,

141
00:08:51.950 --> 00:08:55.360
Diaz remembered he was meant to be a dictator and he rigged the vote.

142
00:08:55.740 --> 00:08:56.573
The new Morales,

143
00:08:56.600 --> 00:09:00.720
governor lost no time hiking taxes on the villages that had supported Zapata's

144
00:09:00.721 --> 00:09:03.600
candidate as a warning to never vote against Diaz. Again,

145
00:09:03.780 --> 00:09:08.640
to say this made Zapata furious is kind of like saying Crackower made a bit of a

146
00:09:08.750 --> 00:09:10.520
bang from this point on.

147
00:09:10.700 --> 00:09:14.120
He was no longer going to play the porphyria's game.

148
00:09:14.140 --> 00:09:17.230
If he years wasn't going to change by his own accord,

149
00:09:17.400 --> 00:09:21.750
maybe it was time that someone forced him. The following year, 1910,

150
00:09:21.830 --> 00:09:26.590
Z Zapata made his first stand a local Hasard had fenced off a

151
00:09:26.591 --> 00:09:28.950
communal hillside. So Zapata armed,

152
00:09:28.951 --> 00:09:33.310
80 men went up to that hillside and tore the fences down for his trouble.

153
00:09:33.410 --> 00:09:37.740
He got labeled a bandit and had to flee into the mountains so far. Well,

154
00:09:37.960 --> 00:09:41.140
so impressive, but something was about to happen in wider Mexico.

155
00:09:41.370 --> 00:09:43.780
That would change Zapatas fortunes.

156
00:09:43.950 --> 00:09:48.020
While those in Morales had got an early warning that Diaz wasn't really gonna

157
00:09:48.021 --> 00:09:51.380
allow fair elections, the rest of Mexico. Hadn't got the message.

158
00:09:51.720 --> 00:09:53.060
So come the 1910 election,

159
00:09:53.300 --> 00:09:57.650
a wealthy liberal named Francisco Madera ran against Diaz and

160
00:09:57.720 --> 00:09:59.930
crucially. Everyone decided to vote for him.

161
00:10:00.030 --> 00:10:02.770
And suddenly Diaz was faced with a country full of people,

162
00:10:02.920 --> 00:10:06.930
desperate to see the back of him. Of course, Diaz didn't let that vote happen.

163
00:10:07.080 --> 00:10:11.250
True to TA he had Madera arrested and declare himself winner of a new

164
00:10:11.251 --> 00:10:12.290
presidential term,

165
00:10:12.430 --> 00:10:16.960
but Diaz had unleashed a very powerful genie with the Creelman interview,

166
00:10:17.600 --> 00:10:22.160
a genie called hope. And once that particular genie was outta the bottle, well,

167
00:10:22.161 --> 00:10:25.920
it was impossible to put back later that year sympathizes helped Francisco

168
00:10:25.921 --> 00:10:30.720
Madera, escape, Mexico, and get into the us. Then Madera made AOUS decision.

169
00:10:31.020 --> 00:10:35.160
If Diaz wasn't going to leave voluntarily Madera would force him out at gun

170
00:10:35.400 --> 00:10:39.390
points. Now just before get into the revolution that is obviously coming.

171
00:10:39.750 --> 00:10:43.230
I want to take a quick moment to tell you about today's sponsor curiosity

172
00:10:43.231 --> 00:10:43.660

195
00:11:56.740 --> 00:12:00.440
It keeps us making more videos and I just couldn't really think of a more

196
00:12:00.510 --> 00:12:05.360
aligned sponsor really? So go check it out. Let's get to that revolution

197
00:12:11.570 --> 00:12:15.470
Today. Mexico celebrates November the 20th as a public holiday ands.

198
00:12:15.830 --> 00:12:18.950
That's when Madera declared his revolution against Diaz.

199
00:12:19.090 --> 00:12:22.350
But if he had been in Mexico on November the 20th, 1910,

200
00:12:22.640 --> 00:12:27.590
you'd have barely noticed that's because Madera's call to arms was heated by

201
00:12:27.730 --> 00:12:29.870
no one. Well almost no one.

202
00:12:30.050 --> 00:12:33.980
The only reason November the 20th has gone down in history is because one of the

203
00:12:33.981 --> 00:12:38.780
few people to he Madera's call was Pancho Villa and via was a guy

204
00:12:39.040 --> 00:12:42.540
who knew how to do a revolution. What about Zapata?

205
00:12:42.880 --> 00:12:45.580
How did he respond to Madera's call? Well,

206
00:12:45.920 --> 00:12:50.540
he didn't really do anything down in Morales Zapata. Couldn't give a cat goad.

207
00:12:50.541 --> 00:12:54.730
What Pancho was doing way up in the north. He wanted Diaz gone,

208
00:12:54.870 --> 00:12:59.090
but it's not like Madeira was promising the land reform in early 1911 though.

209
00:12:59.091 --> 00:13:01.090
Things changed on March the 11th,

210
00:13:01.091 --> 00:13:05.570
Madeira crossed back into Mexico to take control of the growing revolutionary

211
00:13:05.571 --> 00:13:06.930
army almost immediately.

212
00:13:06.930 --> 00:13:11.010
They started absolutely whatting Diaz's guys in battle.

213
00:13:11.810 --> 00:13:16.040
SOPA now faced an urgent choice either on pond to this revolutionary bandwagon

214
00:13:16.041 --> 00:13:19.840
and hope things worked out or step back from the brink and wait for the next

215
00:13:19.841 --> 00:13:20.674
opportunity.

216
00:13:21.160 --> 00:13:25.840
Saada jumped that may Zapata's peasant army managed to capture the city of QLA

217
00:13:25.860 --> 00:13:26.693
at the same time,

218
00:13:26.740 --> 00:13:31.640
Pancho via seized sea dad ho faced with multiple revolutionary armies on

219
00:13:31.880 --> 00:13:35.310
multiple fronts. Di saw the writing on the wall on may the 25th,

220
00:13:35.630 --> 00:13:39.230
1911 por Furio Diaz resigned and boarded a boat to Europe.

221
00:13:39.450 --> 00:13:42.830
He would die in exile just four years later. Fair warning here.

222
00:13:42.980 --> 00:13:47.750
Diaz is just about the only person in this video who is not going to

223
00:13:47.770 --> 00:13:50.070
die violently in the wake of Diaz's fight.

224
00:13:50.071 --> 00:13:54.150
And presidents took over for the sole purpose of organizing new elections.

225
00:13:54.440 --> 00:13:57.380
Since knew that Madeira would win the new interim.

226
00:13:57.381 --> 00:14:00.500
President asked the revolutionary armies to stand down two,

227
00:14:00.501 --> 00:14:05.500
which Zapata replied. Nah, we, we are good and properly captured quite Ava.

228
00:14:05.800 --> 00:14:09.660
If that seems strange to you just to know that Zapata had been burned before he

229
00:14:09.661 --> 00:14:12.940
wasn't going to end his rebellion until Madeira had committed to land reform

230
00:14:13.050 --> 00:14:17.050
that June the two men finally met in Mexico city to discuss the issue while

231
00:14:17.051 --> 00:14:18.810
Madeira didn't give any firm commitments,

232
00:14:19.210 --> 00:14:22.050
Zapata did leave the meeting thinking Madeira was an honest man,

233
00:14:22.260 --> 00:14:25.090
which he could do business with. He was so convinced of this,

234
00:14:25.120 --> 00:14:28.930
that even when the federal army attacked Morales under the blood thirsty

235
00:14:28.931 --> 00:14:29.764
general,

236
00:14:30.130 --> 00:14:34.330
Victorian Huta Zapata thought it was all the interim president's fault.

237
00:14:34.550 --> 00:14:39.120
He thought that Madeira put an end to all of it when he was finally elected.

238
00:14:39.620 --> 00:14:42.280
And to that, we just have to say that, well,

239
00:14:42.560 --> 00:14:46.440
the better you are in for a bit of a nasty surprise that

240
00:14:46.441 --> 00:14:47.800
October,

241
00:14:47.800 --> 00:14:52.040
1911 Madera won the presidency in a landslide almost immediately.

242
00:14:52.040 --> 00:14:55.960
He dispatched an agent to negotiate with Zapata. At first things went well.

243
00:14:56.020 --> 00:14:59.280
The agent seemed super enter Zapata's ideas on land reform.

244
00:14:59.300 --> 00:15:01.800
And it really looked like things were going somewhere.

245
00:15:01.900 --> 00:15:03.000
And then it all went wrong.

246
00:15:03.100 --> 00:15:08.080
Either acting under secret orders or because it'd gone rogue a general in the

247
00:15:08.081 --> 00:15:11.630
federal army, surrounded Zapata's men in middle of negotiations.

248
00:15:12.030 --> 00:15:16.230
When ZPA tried to desperately contact Madera, he got an odd message back.

249
00:15:16.530 --> 00:15:18.590
We will negotiate Madera assure him,

250
00:15:18.850 --> 00:15:23.590
but only if you surrender unconditionally, this was the last straws.

251
00:15:23.790 --> 00:15:26.670
Batter broke off negotiations, taking a small band of men.

252
00:15:26.770 --> 00:15:30.790
He flins the Morales mountains bitter at his apparent betrayal.

253
00:15:31.020 --> 00:15:34.180
It was clearly time for another revolution. Only this time.

254
00:15:34.181 --> 00:15:36.300
It would be as a pat leading the charge

255
00:15:42.680 --> 00:15:43.221
At this point,

256
00:15:43.221 --> 00:15:47.540
you may be wondering why is the pat is a guy who deserves a biographics video?

257
00:15:47.810 --> 00:15:52.730
Sure. He helps overthrow one dictator, but there's gotta be more right. Well,

258
00:15:52.860 --> 00:15:53.693
there is.

259
00:15:53.790 --> 00:15:58.290
And it's known as the plan of I issued by Zapata on November the 28th,

260
00:15:58.650 --> 00:16:01.810
1911 bar, three weeks after Madeira double crossed him.

261
00:16:01.990 --> 00:16:05.970
The plan of I is still one of history's key revolutionary texts,

262
00:16:06.130 --> 00:16:07.770
a radical agrarian manifesto.

263
00:16:07.771 --> 00:16:11.850
It would go on to influence nearly every Latin American revolutionary since and

264
00:16:12.510 --> 00:16:15.440
well, there are lots of Latin American revolutionaries.

265
00:16:15.980 --> 00:16:17.480
So what was it at its heart?

266
00:16:17.540 --> 00:16:22.480
The plan of I was a vision for a farer world based on land redistribution

267
00:16:22.610 --> 00:16:26.680
while it comprised of 15 points, most of them were just trash talking Madera.

268
00:16:26.860 --> 00:16:31.320
So, or concentrate strictly on points, six through eight in a bridge form.

269
00:16:31.550 --> 00:16:35.310
They go something like this 0.6 communal land seized by has,

270
00:16:35.470 --> 00:16:39.470
and datas will be given back to villages 0.71 third of all,

271
00:16:39.471 --> 00:16:43.190
land held by the rich will be ex appropriate and given to the poor.

272
00:16:43.450 --> 00:16:46.110
So everyone has a chance to improve their lot in life.

273
00:16:46.420 --> 00:16:48.910
Land owners will be compensated 0.8.

274
00:16:49.040 --> 00:16:53.900
Those who resist 0.7 will have their lands nationalized without with

275
00:16:53.901 --> 00:16:57.740
the government using this land to create a fund for war widows and the very

276
00:16:57.810 --> 00:16:59.100
poorest the plan of,

277
00:16:59.140 --> 00:17:03.620
I wasn't so much a game changer as it was the creation of a whole new game.

278
00:17:03.800 --> 00:17:05.780
At the time it was written the Russian revolution.

279
00:17:05.880 --> 00:17:07.300
It was still several years off.

280
00:17:07.480 --> 00:17:12.140
The idea of a revolt that put the very poorest in society at its heart was near

281
00:17:12.141 --> 00:17:12.974
unprecedented.

282
00:17:13.130 --> 00:17:17.370
This was a really radical document and it was really gonna blow up Mexico,

283
00:17:17.760 --> 00:17:22.050
that wind revolts against the Madeira government inspired by the plan broke out

284
00:17:22.051 --> 00:17:26.330
across Mexico. So the governments, well, they fought far with fire Morales.

285
00:17:26.390 --> 00:17:28.770
The federal army took Zapata family hostage.

286
00:17:28.840 --> 00:17:32.290
They started burning down villages and funneling the survivors into

287
00:17:32.291 --> 00:17:36.040
concentration camps matter him couldn't have run a better recruitment campaign.

288
00:17:36.220 --> 00:17:39.160
As the atrocities mounted his ranks of gorilla fighters.

289
00:17:39.161 --> 00:17:41.520
They swelled to the tens of thousands.

290
00:17:41.660 --> 00:17:44.200
Not that Zapata ran anything like a regular army though.

291
00:17:44.220 --> 00:17:45.600
His soldiers were peasants.

292
00:17:45.710 --> 00:17:48.640
They often took up arms when needed only to put them down again.

293
00:17:48.641 --> 00:17:52.360
The moment the battle was won and they'd go back to farming nor was the pat

294
00:17:52.760 --> 00:17:54.400
actually their leader. Yet at first,

295
00:17:54.401 --> 00:17:58.560
the peasants in Morales fought in small decentralized groups who occasionally

296
00:17:58.561 --> 00:18:02.440
came together to take a city or whatever it wasn't until early 1913,

297
00:18:02.441 --> 00:18:04.640
that Zapata could really be said to be in charge.

298
00:18:05.060 --> 00:18:09.350
And by then his zapper army was on the verge of taking Mexico city.

299
00:18:09.500 --> 00:18:14.390
When he issued the plan of I ZBA had also issued a promise to March into

300
00:18:14.391 --> 00:18:19.190
Mexico city and personally hang Madera from a tree come early, 1913.

301
00:18:19.410 --> 00:18:22.630
It really looked like he was gonna do it. But fate had other ideas,

302
00:18:22.950 --> 00:18:27.030
an attempted co broke out in Mexico city led by P Furo Diaz's nephew,

303
00:18:27.160 --> 00:18:28.150
Felix Diaz,

304
00:18:28.630 --> 00:18:31.620
while Madera managed a hunker down safely in the presidential palace.

305
00:18:31.720 --> 00:18:35.860
He couldn't defeat the insurrectionists. So he called in general Cueto.

306
00:18:36.000 --> 00:18:39.900
The guy we last met killing civilians in Cueto, took one,

307
00:18:39.901 --> 00:18:44.020
look at the mounting death toll and decided that he could use this for his own

308
00:18:44.090 --> 00:18:48.500
ends on February the 17th QTA switch sides backed by the us ambassador.

309
00:18:48.680 --> 00:18:52.930
He convinced Madera to surrender. Then he had Madera loaded into a car,

310
00:18:52.931 --> 00:18:57.770
driven to a secluded spot and shot debt in the aftermath of the 10 tragic days,

311
00:18:58.410 --> 00:19:01.850
QTA sideline, Felix Diaz, and had himself declared presidents.

312
00:19:01.990 --> 00:19:05.650
His first act was to send a messenger to the batter to see if he wanted to join

313
00:19:05.651 --> 00:19:09.850
forces. And this was the beginning of a new era in the Mexican revolution.

314
00:19:10.180 --> 00:19:14.040
And it wouldn't end until nearly all its players were dead.

315
00:19:20.260 --> 00:19:24.920
The dictatorship of general Huta was as short and as pointless

316
00:19:25.060 --> 00:19:29.600
as a blow up Napoleon sex. Do Wes par got QAs offered to join forces.

317
00:19:30.200 --> 00:19:33.910
It was all. Uh, dude, weren't you the guys killing all those villages?

318
00:19:34.110 --> 00:19:38.150
I more else? No. And then about went straight back to fighting,

319
00:19:38.630 --> 00:19:43.110
but QA was also unpopular outside of Zapatas Creek in the north Pancho Villa

320
00:19:43.220 --> 00:19:45.790
restarted his revolution in the state of Quora here.

321
00:19:46.150 --> 00:19:50.430
Governor Carranza declared himself in rebellion and raised army known as the

322
00:19:50.590 --> 00:19:54.700
constitutional lists before QTA could even warm the president's chair.

323
00:19:55.040 --> 00:19:57.420
His regime was crumbling on all sides.

324
00:19:57.760 --> 00:20:02.380
It didn't help that QTA was basically trying to be the new PIO Diaz. Nope.

325
00:20:02.570 --> 00:20:07.340
Even those who supported his coup didn't want to live under a Poria tribute act

326
00:20:07.720 --> 00:20:08.740
by mid 1914,

327
00:20:08.840 --> 00:20:13.250
the combined pressure of the Soat Easter pan Chaves army and corre

328
00:20:13.730 --> 00:20:18.490
constitutionalists had left Q a a dictator incapable of dictating

329
00:20:18.710 --> 00:20:22.570
to anyone on July. The 14th QTA resigns ends fled Mexico.

330
00:20:23.250 --> 00:20:27.530
Although he would later try to reenter the country and raise a new army Hebe

331
00:20:27.770 --> 00:20:31.890
arrested at the border by us. Authorities he'd died in prison in 1916,

332
00:20:32.340 --> 00:20:35.160
but while Hu's departure was a win for the revolutionaries,

333
00:20:35.340 --> 00:20:37.880
it also made things a thousand times worse.

334
00:20:38.260 --> 00:20:42.480
The problem was that Zapata via and Carranza were all in this fight for

335
00:20:42.481 --> 00:20:43.314
different reasons.

336
00:20:44.000 --> 00:20:48.080
Zapata wanted land reform and to hell with everything else via wanted money and

337
00:20:48.081 --> 00:20:52.120
fame and to hang with some elites while Carranza wanted to be president without

338
00:20:52.121 --> 00:20:52.954
knowing why,

339
00:20:53.070 --> 00:20:57.160
when QTA fled all three of them started eyeing one another sideways,

340
00:20:57.161 --> 00:21:00.200
like the three Cowboys at the end of the good, the bad and the ugly,

341
00:21:00.350 --> 00:21:03.200
knowing that they're going to have to draw pistols on one another,

342
00:21:03.260 --> 00:21:07.910
but unsure until the last seconds who they were gonna going to shoot Zapata

343
00:21:07.980 --> 00:21:09.950
finally made his decision in the fall.

344
00:21:10.200 --> 00:21:13.670
After a failed meeting between the three revolutionary armies Zapata got

345
00:21:13.671 --> 00:21:17.470
frustrated and ordered as men to March on Mexico city on the 24th of November,

346
00:21:17.760 --> 00:21:21.990
Kanza fled the city ahead of 25,000 armed Zapatistas. Incidentally,

347
00:21:21.991 --> 00:21:26.470
those Zapatistas were also overwhelmed by the capital that instead of raid it,

348
00:21:26.500 --> 00:21:30.260
they went barefoot from door to door, shy asking for food and water,

349
00:21:30.560 --> 00:21:32.980
but Zara hadn't taken the city to show off.

350
00:21:33.540 --> 00:21:35.940
He was there to do business on December the sixth,

351
00:21:36.010 --> 00:21:37.700
that business finally arrived.

352
00:21:38.140 --> 00:21:41.940
Pan Villa rode into Mexico city at the head of an even bigger army than Zapatas.

353
00:21:42.040 --> 00:21:45.820
The two men met at the presidential palace to work out the basis of an Alliance.

354
00:21:46.080 --> 00:21:50.650
The basis was this. It would both work to lock Carranza out of power in returns.

355
00:21:51.130 --> 00:21:54.690
ZPA would get his land reform while via would get a civilian president.

356
00:21:55.290 --> 00:21:58.450
One whose name likely rhymed with Banro beer.

357
00:21:58.710 --> 00:22:00.890
As these two great revolutionaries left the palace.

358
00:22:01.000 --> 00:22:04.850
They must have felt their time had finally come and that they were unstoppable.

359
00:22:05.000 --> 00:22:09.800
Neither man knew that the high water mark of the revolution had already come and

360
00:22:09.801 --> 00:22:10.634
had already gone.

361
00:22:10.820 --> 00:22:14.760
All it was left now was for the two of them to be swallowed by the waves

362
00:22:21.320 --> 00:22:24.720
No long after his meeting with via Zapata abandoned Mexico city.

363
00:22:24.910 --> 00:22:29.590
Back in Morales, he started putting the plan of IA into act in practice.

364
00:22:29.620 --> 00:22:31.350
This meant redistributing lands. However,

365
00:22:31.490 --> 00:22:35.870
he saw fit mostly that involved appropriating Hasian, but Saba,

366
00:22:36.010 --> 00:22:37.790
he wasn't above burning them to the ground.

367
00:22:37.930 --> 00:22:40.470
If the local house and data refused to comply,

368
00:22:40.610 --> 00:22:43.590
the Zapp baristas even set up a rural loan bank,

369
00:22:43.591 --> 00:22:46.070
helping peasants to buy their own pots to farm.

370
00:22:46.210 --> 00:22:51.020
It was a transformation for one that SA outer was sure would provide a

371
00:22:51.220 --> 00:22:52.500
template for the entire country.

372
00:22:52.940 --> 00:22:55.700
He even contacted Woodrow Wilson's white house to see if they fancied

373
00:22:55.940 --> 00:22:58.300
recognizing him as Mexico's legitimate president,

374
00:22:58.760 --> 00:23:00.180
the white house passed on the offer.

375
00:23:00.400 --> 00:23:03.700
But whatever high is about was feeling in early 1915,

376
00:23:04.040 --> 00:23:08.740
it was about to be lost forever as was his newest ally in April pane fought

377
00:23:08.741 --> 00:23:13.530
Correas force of the battle of Solia via used his classicness suicidal

378
00:23:14.170 --> 00:23:18.010
cavalry charge, which in this case turned out to be completely suicidal.

379
00:23:19.010 --> 00:23:22.650
Avaro Agon had been studying tactics from world war I and used machine guns to

380
00:23:22.710 --> 00:23:26.130
mow down via army by the end of the battle via was alive,

381
00:23:26.350 --> 00:23:29.970
but no longer a threat. That meant there was nothing to stop Carranza,

382
00:23:30.080 --> 00:23:34.720
turning his attention solely on Zapata that October the United States officially

383
00:23:34.960 --> 00:23:38.520
recognized Carranza as Mexico's head of state around the same time the federal

384
00:23:38.590 --> 00:23:42.960
army moved into Moreos determined to bring Zapata to heal. Once again,

385
00:23:43.040 --> 00:23:46.360
villages were burned. Once again, civilians were killed,

386
00:23:46.460 --> 00:23:50.320
but this time Zapata didn't just flee to the Hills as a noble folk hero.

387
00:23:50.540 --> 00:23:53.360
He tried to fight back using Carranza own tactics.

388
00:23:53.460 --> 00:23:58.440
The results left indelible blood stands on Zapata's legacy in November, 1916,

389
00:23:59.320 --> 00:24:01.880
Zappas bombed two passenger trains heading into Mexico city.

390
00:24:02.260 --> 00:24:07.110
The terror attack killed almost 400 P double the death to of the 2004

391
00:24:07.111 --> 00:24:11.070
Madrid train bombings. While the slaughter didn't dense, the pats popularity,

392
00:24:11.790 --> 00:24:14.430
INEOS it left him isolated in the rest of Mexican society.

393
00:24:14.810 --> 00:24:19.350
The final nail in the coffin came in early 1917 after months of deliberation,

394
00:24:19.410 --> 00:24:23.190
Correa promulgated new constitution. That basically ripped off the plan of,

395
00:24:23.270 --> 00:24:25.700
I it opens the door for appropriations,

396
00:24:25.840 --> 00:24:29.140
for nationalization of communal lands for redistribution,

397
00:24:29.240 --> 00:24:33.660
for a fairer society where peasants were actually treated as humans for most

398
00:24:33.661 --> 00:24:38.540
Mexicans, the constitution of 1917 made the pats of fight seem pretty pointless.

399
00:24:38.800 --> 00:24:42.700
It was sort of a case of, well, dude, you've already won to stop fighting,

400
00:24:43.040 --> 00:24:46.010
but it about a wouldn't stop or maybe he couldn't.

401
00:24:46.310 --> 00:24:49.370
And realistically who could make him, he was still popular.

402
00:24:50.250 --> 00:24:52.330
iNOS no matter how many trains about bomb,

403
00:24:52.470 --> 00:24:56.330
no matter how many constitutions Corrine are issued, nothing would change.

404
00:24:56.350 --> 00:25:00.650
The fact that MAOS was going to stand by Zapata to the bitter end

405
00:25:01.440 --> 00:25:05.970
Soza simply made sure that that end was quicker and more bitter than anyone.

406
00:25:06.200 --> 00:25:08.000
One had expected in 1919,

407
00:25:08.120 --> 00:25:13.040
a federal general fighting in Morales named Hazel Gudo abruptly switched sides.

408
00:25:13.300 --> 00:25:16.680
His unit turned on the other federal forces killing 59 people.

409
00:25:16.750 --> 00:25:21.320
When he got the news Zapata arranged a meeting with Gudo to bring him into the

410
00:25:21.640 --> 00:25:25.680
SAPAC fold. Gudo suggested that they meet in a remote Hacienda.

411
00:25:25.960 --> 00:25:30.390
Apparently having never heard of the concept of a trap Zapata agreed on April

412
00:25:30.391 --> 00:25:31.590
the 10th, 1919,

413
00:25:31.710 --> 00:25:36.630
a Zapata and 10 armed men rode to the abandoned Hass ender to negotiate

414
00:25:36.780 --> 00:25:41.110
with Gudo before Zapata could even open his mouth dozens and dozens of fellow

415
00:25:41.111 --> 00:25:43.030
soldiers opened fire from their hiding places.

416
00:25:43.290 --> 00:25:47.740
The revolutionary never stood a chance S died that Dan hell of bullets,

417
00:25:47.741 --> 00:25:52.060
just like the latest Mexican revolutionary to meet a violent fate.

418
00:25:52.400 --> 00:25:55.460
He would not be the last barely a year later on may.

419
00:25:55.461 --> 00:26:00.260
The 21st Carranza would be assassinated turn by his former general Avaro

420
00:26:00.700 --> 00:26:04.260
Agon Aragon's block would blast a little longer before he too was assassinated

421
00:26:04.280 --> 00:26:07.500
in 1928, by then the only other leader to survive.

422
00:26:07.710 --> 00:26:12.370
The revolution was also debt Pancho was gunned down in 1923 in an ambush,

423
00:26:12.470 --> 00:26:15.410
not unlike the one that killed Zapata and just to tie things up,

424
00:26:15.411 --> 00:26:20.050
we should probably mention that Gudo was also assassinated after helping arrange

425
00:26:20.070 --> 00:26:21.330
the Pat's assassination,

426
00:26:21.331 --> 00:26:25.530
because apparently that's just how things roll in revolutionary Mexico.

427
00:26:26.150 --> 00:26:28.560
And like I said, at the beginning, this video,

428
00:26:28.820 --> 00:26:32.600
we did warn you that everyone was gonna die violently at the end of all that

429
00:26:32.601 --> 00:26:35.280
bloodshed, what did Alion Asata really achieve?

430
00:26:35.620 --> 00:26:38.280
Why don't we still know his name today for an answer to that,

431
00:26:38.510 --> 00:26:43.200
just look back at the plan of I in the decade of the revolution land reform had

432
00:26:43.201 --> 00:26:47.760
gone from a drum being banged by a few obsessed peasants in more to

433
00:26:47.761 --> 00:26:50.160
something the whole of Mexico cared about.

434
00:26:50.470 --> 00:26:55.200
Even though Carranza 1917 constitution was scrapped after he was assassinated

435
00:26:55.480 --> 00:26:59.640
elements of the plan of I still crept into its successor. Even today,

436
00:26:59.641 --> 00:27:03.470
it affect how many in Latin America think about land rights,

437
00:27:03.650 --> 00:27:08.030
but Zapata was more than just a guy who wrote an influential plan. In his years,

438
00:27:08.050 --> 00:27:12.230
as a revolutionary Zapata became famous as someone who cared about the poor,

439
00:27:12.450 --> 00:27:14.630
who was uncompromising in his beliefs,

440
00:27:14.631 --> 00:27:19.310
who was willing to stand up to a rotten system. He was far from a perfect man,

441
00:27:19.330 --> 00:27:23.300
but he was also something more than a mere human. He was a focus hero,

442
00:27:23.700 --> 00:27:28.420
a Robin hood who existed a myth brought to life for all his

443
00:27:28.421 --> 00:27:31.180
faults. I mean the honors of pat is one folk hero.

444
00:27:31.720 --> 00:27:35.700
The world will never forget. So I hope you found that video. Interesting.
