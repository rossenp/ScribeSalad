6
00:00:14.341 --> 00:00:16.680
I got more on them in a bit and let's get into it.

7
00:00:22.670 --> 00:00:25.670
Andy Warhol was born three times. The first two,

8
00:00:25.790 --> 00:00:29.690
his parents is Andy Warhol up the second time as a commercial artist,

9
00:00:29.691 --> 00:00:32.390
raggedy Andy, after a failed fascination,

10
00:00:32.391 --> 00:00:36.820
he was reborn the final time as the artistic Paragon and

11
00:00:36.860 --> 00:00:41.810
cultural revolutionary, or then the worldwide as Andy Warhol, Charles,

12
00:00:41.811 --> 00:00:45.470
number four to a poor immigrant family raised in a tenement building during the

13
00:00:45.471 --> 00:00:46.310
great depression.

14
00:00:46.311 --> 00:00:51.290
The story of ND is the story of the American dream itself with a

15
00:00:51.291 --> 00:00:55.910
little extra obsession, drugs and murder sprinkled on top.

16
00:00:55.940 --> 00:00:58.100
Perfect for his Hollywood heart.

17
00:01:04.880 --> 00:01:08.240
It's impossible to overstate his contributions, not just a painting,

18
00:01:08.241 --> 00:01:12.800
but to the entire science of seeing the idea that a mass market objects could be

19
00:01:12.801 --> 00:01:15.620
elevated to the status of art. Just by how it's looked at.

20
00:01:15.830 --> 00:01:19.880
It's such a profound rejection of every standard, which came before it,

21
00:01:19.881 --> 00:01:22.700
that we no longer even recognize it as revolutionary.

22
00:01:22.701 --> 00:01:26.630
It has been internalized whole cloth as the new truth.

23
00:01:26.870 --> 00:01:29.720
The audience decides what is art?

24
00:01:29.990 --> 00:01:34.370
Just as much as democracy is a rejection of the divine right of Kings Andy's

25
00:01:34.371 --> 00:01:38.870
contributions to the American perspective is so ingrained that we no longer

26
00:01:38.871 --> 00:01:42.680
recognize them as his art, his attention in the future.

27
00:01:42.860 --> 00:01:45.260
We'll all be famous for 15 minutes.

28
00:01:45.410 --> 00:01:49.850
The terms superstar is one he coins to describe the hippies and drag Queens that

29
00:01:49.910 --> 00:01:51.410
are used for camera fought it.

30
00:01:51.830 --> 00:01:54.470
And he understood better than any of his contemporaries.

31
00:01:54.471 --> 00:01:59.000
That what the public wants is to be told that they matter that the trappings of

32
00:01:59.001 --> 00:02:02.180
consumer culture are part of a grander narrative.

33
00:02:02.330 --> 00:02:06.440
Even in television and movies, every behind the scenes feature pits,

34
00:02:06.470 --> 00:02:10.130
heroic creatives against the evil studio money men,

35
00:02:10.190 --> 00:02:12.680
it's not enough to enjoy a piece of entertainment.

36
00:02:12.710 --> 00:02:16.790
The work itself must be the product of this Titanic struggle,

37
00:02:16.791 --> 00:02:21.500
or it really doesn't have any weight to it. The drama gives it significance.

38
00:02:21.560 --> 00:02:23.240
No one would remember five life.

39
00:02:23.241 --> 00:02:27.590
It wasn't defined by the conflict between Joss Whedon at a bunch of nameless

40
00:02:27.591 --> 00:02:31.610
executives who loved blowing huge opportunities. That's the drama,

41
00:02:31.611 --> 00:02:36.560
which inspired Andy to paint Liza Minnelli as a career and marriage began

42
00:02:36.561 --> 00:02:40.730
to crumble. That's why he painted his death and disaster series one,

43
00:02:40.731 --> 00:02:44.030
which holds the record for Warhols most expensive work.

44
00:02:44.120 --> 00:02:48.950
America loves an underdog and there is no bigger underdog than the victim in a

45
00:02:48.951 --> 00:02:51.860
fight against yourself. It's a hunger for celebrities,

46
00:02:51.861 --> 00:02:56.300
which drives their self destruction. And here Andy comes along,

47
00:02:56.301 --> 00:02:59.680
turning a silkscreen headshot into the kind icon.

48
00:02:59.860 --> 00:03:02.260
They build chapels around equal pods,

49
00:03:02.800 --> 00:03:07.000
Relic and lecture on the cynical hazards of icon worship, the same hazard,

50
00:03:07.240 --> 00:03:10.060
which would later temporarily customers' life.

51
00:03:16.410 --> 00:03:19.050
And he grew up in the shadow of the Saint John Chris Austin,

52
00:03:19.051 --> 00:03:20.700
Byzantine Catholic church,

53
00:03:20.701 --> 00:03:25.170
which is known for its huge ends or need wall of gold leaf falling columns with

54
00:03:25.171 --> 00:03:28.440
their unreasonably beatific expressions and similar poses.

55
00:03:28.441 --> 00:03:32.010
This became the Genesis for Andy's experimentation with repeated images,

56
00:03:32.070 --> 00:03:33.810
the worship for quality of his portrayed.

57
00:03:33.811 --> 00:03:38.220
So the use of color elevates the mortal to the eternal. Everything is here.

58
00:03:38.280 --> 00:03:42.210
You can trace every single one of his artistic motifs to this one place.

59
00:03:42.270 --> 00:03:45.990
There's a direct line between spending eight hours a week in charge staring at a

60
00:03:45.991 --> 00:03:49.140
gold leafed image of Marion's. Then 30 years later,

61
00:03:49.170 --> 00:03:52.380
painting Marilyn Monroe on top of more gold leaf,

62
00:03:52.440 --> 00:03:56.730
the conflation of consumption and worship is rampant in Warhols work because

63
00:03:56.910 --> 00:04:00.720
that's is the language America uses to express desire and reverends.

64
00:04:00.780 --> 00:04:03.780
They eat what they worship. Celebrity is communion.

65
00:04:03.870 --> 00:04:08.040
Success in America is being incorporated into the greater whole,

66
00:04:08.041 --> 00:04:10.590
like how the calcium in milk becomes bone and teeth.

67
00:04:10.710 --> 00:04:14.850
Andy is the calcium of modernity. That's why his hair was white.

68
00:04:15.120 --> 00:04:15.811
And the third grade,

69
00:04:15.811 --> 00:04:19.080
he had to take a temporary leave of absence when a nerve disease named some

70
00:04:19.530 --> 00:04:22.860
VITAS as dance, plagues him with involuntary muscle spasms,

71
00:04:22.890 --> 00:04:25.650
he would struggle to write his name on the chalkboard and other children would

72
00:04:25.890 --> 00:04:28.530
bully him so much that he simply refused to return.

73
00:04:28.770 --> 00:04:32.370
It's this period of affliction and sickness in which the seeds of waterholes

74
00:04:32.380 --> 00:04:34.350
genius sprout to keep him occupied.

75
00:04:34.440 --> 00:04:36.330
His mother provided him with Hollywood magazines,

76
00:04:36.331 --> 00:04:40.860
newsletters from fan groups and plenty of paper for experimentation going so far

77
00:04:41.040 --> 00:04:44.070
as to build a doctrine in the basement for his photography will hold began

78
00:04:44.071 --> 00:04:47.100
collecting autographed pictures with his Shirley temple.

79
00:04:47.101 --> 00:04:49.680
As the jewel of the set to incentivize creation.

80
00:04:49.681 --> 00:04:53.160
His mother would provide a piece of chocolate for every completed work of art.

81
00:04:53.340 --> 00:04:56.550
This motivation clearly stuck with Anthony because after he recovered,

82
00:04:56.551 --> 00:04:59.700
he continued taking art classes through elementary and high school,

83
00:04:59.820 --> 00:05:02.820
pursuing a college degree at Carnegie Mellon in commercial art,

84
00:05:09.630 --> 00:05:12.900
Amazing in 1948, Andy Warhola moved to New York city.

85
00:05:13.200 --> 00:05:17.160
He was always withdrawn even before baking it a central part of his public

86
00:05:17.161 --> 00:05:21.180
persona, a shy boy with a large nose and an inconsistent complexion,

87
00:05:21.181 --> 00:05:23.520
which he would later attempt to address through surgery.

88
00:05:23.670 --> 00:05:26.610
He was insecure about everything, but his talents,

89
00:05:26.790 --> 00:05:29.880
the quickly attracted respect from the art directors and magazines for his

90
00:05:29.881 --> 00:05:31.980
technical skills and the unique appeal.

91
00:05:31.981 --> 00:05:35.580
If it's self developed blotted line technique or style of simple printmaking

92
00:05:35.581 --> 00:05:38.520
using a wetting drawing pressed against transfer paper,

93
00:05:38.700 --> 00:05:40.410
perhaps more so even than his art,

94
00:05:40.411 --> 00:05:43.920
Andy developed a reputation for being well a bit weird.

95
00:05:44.040 --> 00:05:46.950
In addition to his physical uniqueness, his clothes were tattered.

96
00:05:46.951 --> 00:05:51.510
His shoes broken in and his art was delivered in crumpled paper bags rather than

97
00:05:51.511 --> 00:05:52.920
professional portfolios.

98
00:05:53.340 --> 00:05:58.310
In a phrase he kind of stuck out glamour was the first to commission him

99
00:05:58.311 --> 00:06:02.660
to illustrate shoes for an article titled what is success perhaps accidentally?

100
00:06:02.690 --> 00:06:07.040
He was credited as Warhol and his rebirth as a commercial artist when it was

101
00:06:07.041 --> 00:06:07.874
complete.

102
00:06:07.910 --> 00:06:11.750
His whimsical style soon won him contracts with Vogue Columbia records and

103
00:06:11.751 --> 00:06:15.680
Tiffany and co is upwards trajectory. It's only increased when in 1952,

104
00:06:15.681 --> 00:06:19.340
his mother arrived on the stupid as apartment to inform him that she had sold

105
00:06:19.341 --> 00:06:21.140
the family house almost immediately.

106
00:06:21.141 --> 00:06:25.040
They started collaborating on commercial works as well as art books for friends,

107
00:06:25.130 --> 00:06:29.810
she designs and tan drew to record label for New York busker icon Moondog,

108
00:06:29.840 --> 00:06:31.310
which even won an award,

109
00:06:31.430 --> 00:06:34.490
no matter how much ends you may have worried about his mother embarrassing him

110
00:06:34.491 --> 00:06:35.810
in front of his trendy friends.

111
00:06:35.811 --> 00:06:40.280
They live together and work together for the next 20 years until her death as

112
00:06:40.820 --> 00:06:44.270
hardworking as our son was how unique I and flowing script helped refine the

113
00:06:44.271 --> 00:06:47.630
style that brought in so much praise and success. However,

114
00:06:47.690 --> 00:06:51.290
this wasn't enough for the ambitious young artist, more than security.

115
00:06:51.350 --> 00:06:55.310
He wanted to be respected for his talents. And even perhaps at Mott,

116
00:06:55.520 --> 00:06:58.550
he wanted the world to know why he mattered

117
00:07:05.480 --> 00:07:06.940
This flourishing point in his career.

118
00:07:06.941 --> 00:07:09.760
The Tandy comes to grips with his same sex attraction,

119
00:07:09.790 --> 00:07:12.430
even if fulfilling his ambitions brief difficult.

120
00:07:12.730 --> 00:07:16.090
His first kiss didn't come until he was 25 and he wasn't able to perform the

121
00:07:16.091 --> 00:07:20.140
rest of the night's duties after being rejected during a trip to Honolulu,

122
00:07:20.170 --> 00:07:23.590
he complained to her friends that he had gone around the world with a boy and

123
00:07:23.680 --> 00:07:25.750
his not even received one kiss,

124
00:07:25.810 --> 00:07:30.040
most biographers contend to say that he was gay in an era where that could get

125
00:07:30.041 --> 00:07:33.670
you arrested. But the truth is somewhat more convoluted.

126
00:07:33.850 --> 00:07:38.170
The difficulty Walter had with relationships and the consummation there ROV as

127
00:07:38.320 --> 00:07:42.220
well as his habit of incorporating voyeurism and celibacy into his creative

128
00:07:42.221 --> 00:07:47.200
process has inspired much academic speculation as to as possible like sexuality.

129
00:07:47.230 --> 00:07:50.140
He himself claims to be a Virgin in 1980.

130
00:07:50.440 --> 00:07:53.740
This is contradicted by testimony from former lovers,

131
00:07:53.830 --> 00:07:57.010
as well as the time that he sought treatment for an STD in 1960.

132
00:07:59.920 --> 00:08:04.900
It's an extremely Andy Warhol move to saturate your life and work with sex

133
00:08:04.901 --> 00:08:09.670
only to deny its ultimate power negating sex in an era where it had never been

134
00:08:09.671 --> 00:08:13.750
more ubiquitous was just another way in which he stood out from the crowd and

135
00:08:13.770 --> 00:08:17.350
observer of the culture that was chasing his every move.

136
00:08:24.100 --> 00:08:24.250
<v 2>[Inaudible].</v>

137
00:08:24.250 --> 00:08:26.860
<v 0>Have you unfamiliar with new York's publishing scene in the 1950s,</v>

138
00:08:26.890 --> 00:08:31.120
Truman Capote was a young literary hot shot who was in the process of blowing

139
00:08:31.121 --> 00:08:36.040
everyone's minds by somehow managing to succeed in writing strictly on

140
00:08:36.041 --> 00:08:40.390
merit alone, instead of a college alumini network and someone else's money.

141
00:08:40.450 --> 00:08:45.190
He was stylishly gay beloved by the art world and to Andy Warhol wanted to be

142
00:08:45.191 --> 00:08:49.030
him. He started leaving little illustrations in capacity's mailbox.

143
00:08:49.170 --> 00:08:51.790
It eventually escalated to Warhol waiting outside his door,

144
00:08:51.880 --> 00:08:54.670
hoping to develop a friendship through sheer insistence.

145
00:08:54.790 --> 00:08:58.920
It work Kaposi rejected him later describing him as one of those hopeless

146
00:08:58.921 --> 00:08:59.790
people, you know,

147
00:08:59.820 --> 00:09:04.050
nothing's ever going to happen to and a hopeless born loser,

148
00:09:04.140 --> 00:09:07.920
a rejection like that can sure make a fellow appreciate being ghosted,

149
00:09:08.250 --> 00:09:12.360
undaunted, or whole turned this rejection into fuel for his first fine art show.

150
00:09:12.361 --> 00:09:14.880
15 drawings based on the works of Truman Capote,

151
00:09:15.330 --> 00:09:18.540
despite being a master of all works of flowing unbroken lines,

152
00:09:18.840 --> 00:09:20.340
none of them sold this,

153
00:09:20.341 --> 00:09:24.840
set the pattern for his early forays into fine art on the rare occasions that he

154
00:09:24.841 --> 00:09:29.070
actually managed to earn gallery space in the sharpest possible contrast to his

155
00:09:29.071 --> 00:09:32.940
continued success as a commercial illustrator gallery owners and art dealers

156
00:09:33.440 --> 00:09:35.970
refused to help him sell his work before he dismantled his obsolete,

157
00:09:35.971 --> 00:09:40.050
there was a fairly substantial barrier between commercial and fine artists,

158
00:09:40.080 --> 00:09:41.370
but even more so than that,

159
00:09:41.371 --> 00:09:46.290
Andy was gay and is off putting in a city that eats weakness grounds had to gave

160
00:09:46.350 --> 00:09:50.130
her the New York art scene sounds like the setup for a joke where the punchline

161
00:09:50.131 --> 00:09:52.140
is Lucy came masturbating,

162
00:09:52.141 --> 00:09:55.410
but this was absolutely the case in the 1950s.

163
00:09:55.660 --> 00:10:00.510
Then the city was ruled by Jackson and his band of whiskey soaked

164
00:10:00.511 --> 00:10:04.920
heterosexual abstract impressionists of what art dealers and buyers wanted.

165
00:10:04.921 --> 00:10:07.980
When Warhol showed up with his second collection of ink drawings,

166
00:10:08.010 --> 00:10:10.350
this collection was called studies for a boy book,

167
00:10:10.680 --> 00:10:14.190
and there was simply no market for his kind of obsession.

168
00:10:14.550 --> 00:10:15.630
It sort of scared people,

169
00:10:15.870 --> 00:10:18.570
but no matter how good his work was everywhere Warhol went,

170
00:10:18.690 --> 00:10:22.980
he was rejected for being too swish to camp, to weird those same traits,

171
00:10:22.981 --> 00:10:27.210
which would soon bring him more fame and admirers than he could handle.

172
00:10:27.330 --> 00:10:30.900
And look, maybe you're an aspiring artist or not. Well,

173
00:10:31.050 --> 00:10:32.190
what have you been doing online?

174
00:10:32.191 --> 00:10:34.320
Whether it's starting a business or something like that? Well,

175
00:10:34.321 --> 00:10:37.590
that's where today's sponsors Squarespace can come in. Well, two simple things,

176
00:10:37.591 --> 00:10:40.470
maybe you've got some idea for a website or a business,

177
00:10:40.471 --> 00:10:43.020
or you want to show off your art. Well,

178
00:10:43.590 --> 00:10:47.670
to the only way to find out if that's worth doing is to get that idea out into

179
00:10:47.671 --> 00:10:48.031
the world.

180
00:10:48.031 --> 00:10:51.630
And that can be a bit daunting because it's scary to go and pursue new things.

181
00:10:51.631 --> 00:10:56.130
But you know, not knowing how to set up a website is not an excuse because,

182
00:10:56.670 --> 00:10:58.140
well, you've got Squarespace.

198
00:11:50.540 --> 00:11:54.010
<v 2>Uh, well.</v>

199
00:11:54.010 --> 00:11:57.700
<v 0>Warhol is those widely known pop artist. He oddly invented the genre.</v>

200
00:11:57.701 --> 00:12:01.900
He was inspired most directly by the work of James Rosenquist and Roy

201
00:12:01.930 --> 00:12:04.630
Lichtenstein, who both Rose to prominence painting,

202
00:12:04.631 --> 00:12:09.310
flat representations of advertisements and other cultural detritus

203
00:12:10.030 --> 00:12:11.080
Warhol set to work immediately.

204
00:12:11.081 --> 00:12:15.040
Painting scenes taken from Nancy cartoons and comic book, wig advertisements.

205
00:12:15.100 --> 00:12:17.740
The work was not popular even with Andy.

206
00:12:17.800 --> 00:12:21.760
There's a period of approximately 14 months between Warhols decision to pursue

207
00:12:21.761 --> 00:12:25.180
fine art and his first major success in 1961,

208
00:12:25.181 --> 00:12:27.280
he painted two versions of a Coca-Cola bottle,

209
00:12:27.310 --> 00:12:31.600
wonderful of the brush strokes and human marks of creation and the other without

210
00:12:31.660 --> 00:12:35.650
Coca-Cola two was a sterile. And as hard-lined as a neon sign,

211
00:12:35.830 --> 00:12:38.350
no trace of the artist remained nothing.

212
00:12:38.351 --> 00:12:41.350
Human in short it's blew the first one out of the water,

213
00:12:41.440 --> 00:12:43.870
his friends called it naked Savage barren,

214
00:12:43.900 --> 00:12:46.570
nothing of the painting existed between the message and the audience,

215
00:12:46.571 --> 00:12:50.860
no gradients. So shadows for the eye to Haydn. And he had found a star.

216
00:12:51.270 --> 00:12:52.103
<v 2>Wow.</v>

217
00:12:58.030 --> 00:13:01.260
<v 0>Ariel Itau is the name of the woman who inspired Andy Warhol to paint the 32</v>

218
00:13:01.261 --> 00:13:05.010
cans of Campbell's soup. When he asked her for ideas, she simply said,

219
00:13:05.220 --> 00:13:09.030
you like money. You should paint pictures of money. You should paint something.

220
00:13:09.031 --> 00:13:13.920
Everybody sees every day that everyone recognizes like a can of soup

221
00:13:13.950 --> 00:13:17.130
frenzy. Campbell soup was more than just the kind of convenient meal,

222
00:13:17.131 --> 00:13:21.480
which didn't interrupt. His workflow is also held, deepen personal significance.

223
00:13:21.510 --> 00:13:22.350
During his childhood,

224
00:13:22.351 --> 00:13:26.100
his mother suffered from colon cancer and had to be hospitalized for six weeks.

225
00:13:26.400 --> 00:13:27.211
Every day, she was gone.

226
00:13:27.211 --> 00:13:31.410
His older brother would make him a soup and a sandwich and reassure him that his

227
00:13:31.411 --> 00:13:34.680
mother was going to be okay. That's what these cans represents.

228
00:13:34.800 --> 00:13:37.470
That's what that inspired by a sobbing child.

229
00:13:37.500 --> 00:13:41.340
Desperate to believe that his mother will be okay taking their daily ritual of

230
00:13:41.341 --> 00:13:45.290
soup consumption becomes reverends. And through his tie,

231
00:13:45.330 --> 00:13:48.150
his mother was restored to him. We're not exaggerating.

232
00:13:48.180 --> 00:13:51.780
When we said that Andy painted his religious icons to him. The soup can,

233
00:13:51.810 --> 00:13:55.800
was a symbol of resurrection and it certainly resurrected his career while whole

234
00:13:55.801 --> 00:13:59.340
painted one portrays of each available variety of Campbell soup.

235
00:13:59.370 --> 00:14:01.620
And when they were displayed in a Hollywood gallery,

236
00:14:01.621 --> 00:14:05.370
he bought the popup movements to the West coast instead of waiting for the world

237
00:14:05.371 --> 00:14:08.790
to find out, to accept him. He batted down the doors instead.

238
00:14:14.820 --> 00:14:15.000
<v 2>[Inaudible].</v>

239
00:14:15.000 --> 00:14:18.210
<v 0>August, 1962 marks another evolution in his career.</v>

240
00:14:18.211 --> 00:14:22.140
The incorporation of drawn and photographed silkscreens in his paintings.

241
00:14:22.380 --> 00:14:26.670
The inconsistencies of his blotted lines replaced almost overnight with the

242
00:14:26.671 --> 00:14:30.810
divine accidents of an artistic method reduced to assembly line efficiency.

243
00:14:31.020 --> 00:14:33.660
He focuses first on Hollywood icons from his youth,

244
00:14:33.661 --> 00:14:36.660
followed by stars in decline like Liza Minnelli.

245
00:14:36.870 --> 00:14:39.660
And he got started on a series of Marilyn Monroe paintings.

246
00:14:39.661 --> 00:14:44.610
The same day she died and eventually debuted them to huge public response using

247
00:14:44.611 --> 00:14:46.350
a still from the 1953 movie,

248
00:14:46.351 --> 00:14:50.580
Niagara bendy took an image of her in the prime of our youth and joy and fruit,

249
00:14:50.610 --> 00:14:52.250
countless repeated silk screenings.

250
00:14:52.251 --> 00:14:56.900
Eventually slowly transforms the joyful smile into a bit of grumpy mace,

251
00:14:56.930 --> 00:15:00.320
the kind of richness grin, which precedes oblivion.

252
00:15:00.380 --> 00:15:02.840
No peace makes this more clear than the Marilyn dipped here.

253
00:15:02.960 --> 00:15:07.010
A series of colored portraits juxtapose next to a row of washed out and

254
00:15:07.220 --> 00:15:10.460
incomplete black and white images. The commentary is obvious.

255
00:15:10.490 --> 00:15:12.500
Not only does it resemble a film strip,

256
00:15:12.530 --> 00:15:16.520
but the increasingly vague monochrome transfers really capture how it feels to

257
00:15:16.521 --> 00:15:19.580
wear out the memory of a loved one. It's more than just death.

258
00:15:19.610 --> 00:15:23.930
It's the very public death that only the extremely famous get to live through

259
00:15:23.960 --> 00:15:28.610
the slow relegation to the B roll of history, perhaps not. Coincidentally,

260
00:15:28.611 --> 00:15:32.000
this is also the era he starts producing and directing his own films.

261
00:15:32.180 --> 00:15:35.570
Eight hours of the empire state building vanishing into the night sky,

262
00:15:35.690 --> 00:15:37.610
six hours of his boyfriend sleeping,

263
00:15:37.640 --> 00:15:41.780
the kind of deliberately impenetrable stuff that gets modern day freshmen kicked

264
00:15:41.781 --> 00:15:45.920
out of film school. You also produce the campions unlicensed Batman Dracula,

265
00:15:46.070 --> 00:15:49.460
which is exactly what you would imagine. Just two years later, Adam,

266
00:15:49.461 --> 00:15:53.900
West's knowingly tongue-in-cheek take on the Cape Crusader debuts with the power

267
00:15:53.930 --> 00:15:54.290
bap,

268
00:15:54.290 --> 00:15:58.220
Batman TV and movie shows the parents remember though it was only ever displayed

269
00:15:58.221 --> 00:16:00.050
in galleries or as part of shows,

270
00:16:00.051 --> 00:16:04.040
these screenings were taking place in New York city and Hollywood at the height

271
00:16:04.160 --> 00:16:05.690
of Warhols fame scenes,

272
00:16:05.691 --> 00:16:09.680
a popular actor like Adam West would absolutely have access to the influence is

273
00:16:09.681 --> 00:16:12.770
on the Knotel and remains a core part of Batman to this day.

274
00:16:12.830 --> 00:16:15.860
Apparently even superheroes, when not beyond the reach of Warhol.

275
00:16:16.210 --> 00:16:17.350
<v 1>Why don't you just tell me your words.</v>

276
00:16:24.940 --> 00:16:29.710
<v 0>In 1963 at a friend's a decorator's work and party space with</v>

277
00:16:29.711 --> 00:16:33.130
mirrors and tinfoil and the silver factory. It was born to Warhol,

278
00:16:33.160 --> 00:16:35.950
silver represented both the coming space, age, future,

279
00:16:35.951 --> 00:16:38.470
and the silver screens of Hollywood's glamorous past.

280
00:16:38.680 --> 00:16:42.250
It also represented a mirror, narcissism and shorts.

281
00:16:42.340 --> 00:16:45.910
It reflects now it gives us what we want us.

282
00:16:46.060 --> 00:16:49.960
His entourage immediately starts using it as a base of operations for a nearly

283
00:16:49.961 --> 00:16:52.720
continuous stream of artistic creation and revelry,

284
00:16:52.721 --> 00:16:55.420
which would continue for most of the rest of the decade.

285
00:16:55.630 --> 00:16:58.330
It became the de facto syndrome of the New York art scene.

286
00:16:58.360 --> 00:17:01.570
Bob Dylan would go there. Jagger, Salvador Dali, Liza Minnelli,

287
00:17:01.571 --> 00:17:04.990
William S Burroughs. Even David Bowie called himself a regular in one room.

288
00:17:04.991 --> 00:17:07.960
People were doing speed and another people were filming a music video for the

289
00:17:07.961 --> 00:17:11.710
velvet underground Warhol would be making silk screens in one corner of the

290
00:17:11.711 --> 00:17:14.530
workshop while at the other drag Queens vamps.

291
00:17:14.590 --> 00:17:16.480
It was in every sense back in alien.

292
00:17:16.540 --> 00:17:20.410
And just like in the story of the Beckham's Warhol would find himself torn

293
00:17:20.411 --> 00:17:23.200
asunder by the very party that he cultivated.

294
00:17:29.410 --> 00:17:33.040
The central irony in the assassination of Andy Warhol is that he wasn't even the

295
00:17:33.041 --> 00:17:36.550
initial target. He was the understudy for his own death.

296
00:17:36.580 --> 00:17:40.420
Valerie Solanas stuffed the guns in a coat that day intending to murder her

297
00:17:40.421 --> 00:17:42.280
publisher, Maurice Jared.

298
00:17:42.760 --> 00:17:46.630
She waited outside his apartment for three hours in an unseasonably,

299
00:17:46.631 --> 00:17:47.680
warm hat and coat,

300
00:17:47.710 --> 00:17:52.140
but lucky for him missed that particular appointment with fate crestfallen,

301
00:17:52.141 --> 00:17:55.650
but unwilling to abandon our plans for the day she had it next to Warhols

302
00:17:55.651 --> 00:17:59.880
factory. He knew vinery is the author of an extremely graphic anti-male place.

303
00:17:59.881 --> 00:18:03.780
So violence that he initially suspected her to be a police informant.

304
00:18:03.810 --> 00:18:07.110
She believed him to be part of a conspiracy to steal this scripts.

305
00:18:07.111 --> 00:18:11.010
When instead it had been misplaced. When they arrived in his office,

306
00:18:11.011 --> 00:18:14.430
she drew her two automatic pistols and wounded Warhol.

307
00:18:14.490 --> 00:18:17.880
She was preparing to execute an assistant when the elevator opened and she

308
00:18:17.881 --> 00:18:21.300
simply fled Dunning herself over to the police. Several hours later,

309
00:18:21.540 --> 00:18:24.540
she left behind a paper bag at the factory containing her address,

310
00:18:24.541 --> 00:18:26.940
a backup gun and a single sanitary napkin.

311
00:18:27.080 --> 00:18:30.570
The idea that the assassination of Andy Warhol was intended as some kind of

312
00:18:30.571 --> 00:18:34.920
theatrical performance or social critique has been discussed quite seriously.

313
00:18:34.921 --> 00:18:38.610
In academic circles. Battery's work is obscene and confrontational,

314
00:18:38.611 --> 00:18:43.470
including the much maligned scum manifesto wins. The one woman organization,

315
00:18:43.590 --> 00:18:48.090
it spawns the society for cutting up men shortly thereafter, many other artists,

316
00:18:48.091 --> 00:18:51.630
including Chris burden in his museum, destroying sculpture, Samson,

317
00:18:51.840 --> 00:18:55.590
which incorporates gun plans, their work for a certain type of new Yorker.

318
00:18:55.591 --> 00:18:58.830
The temporary death of Warhol marks at the end of the innocent sixties,

319
00:18:59.040 --> 00:19:02.400
the ramifications of the shooting would lingo with Warhol for the rest of his

320
00:19:02.401 --> 00:19:02.761
days,

321
00:19:02.761 --> 00:19:06.810
which is understandable considering he only survived because the doctor reached

322
00:19:06.811 --> 00:19:09.690
into his chest and hands massage to his heart.

323
00:19:09.960 --> 00:19:13.170
No one jumps back from that without a scar,

324
00:19:13.470 --> 00:19:16.830
he was required to wear a surgical girdle around the operating sites,

325
00:19:16.860 --> 00:19:18.690
much like these silver screen darlings.

326
00:19:18.691 --> 00:19:22.590
He so admired and childhood far from being shocked out of a semi effected

327
00:19:23.040 --> 00:19:27.450
malaise Warhol seem to retreat into the unreality of it all remarking before I

328
00:19:27.451 --> 00:19:28.230
was shot,

329
00:19:28.230 --> 00:19:32.730
I always thought that I was more half that than all that I always suspected.

330
00:19:32.760 --> 00:19:34.950
The talk was watching TV instead of living life.

331
00:19:35.040 --> 00:19:38.130
People sometimes say that the way things happen in movies is unreal,

332
00:19:38.160 --> 00:19:42.000
but actually it's the way things happen in life. That's unreal.

333
00:19:42.180 --> 00:19:44.600
The movies make emotions look so strong and real.

334
00:19:44.630 --> 00:19:48.320
Whereas when things really do happen to you, it's like watching television.

335
00:19:48.380 --> 00:19:50.810
You don't feel it right when I was being shot.

336
00:19:50.811 --> 00:19:54.650
And ever since I knew that I was watching television, the channels switch,

337
00:19:54.890 --> 00:19:58.220
but it's all television. While this brought down the Gates on the open door,

338
00:19:58.250 --> 00:20:01.730
factory walls reputation as a nightclub, regular was just getting started.

339
00:20:01.910 --> 00:20:04.970
He would spend so much of the seventies hobnobbing with New York royalty and the

340
00:20:05.180 --> 00:20:06.290
theme of studio 54,

341
00:20:06.410 --> 00:20:10.370
taking it all in as fuel for high paying commissions of celebrities, socialites,

342
00:20:10.371 --> 00:20:14.420
and an actual shop. He founded his interview, a celebrity interview magazine,

343
00:20:14.421 --> 00:20:16.790
which is still being published for a normal person.

344
00:20:16.791 --> 00:20:19.880
That's a huge amount of work. Most people never even get to paint Azir,

345
00:20:19.881 --> 00:20:23.630
let alone a full sharp, but for the creator of the exploding plastic,

346
00:20:23.631 --> 00:20:27.770
inevitable, the orgy com art show, which inspired the rave.

347
00:20:27.920 --> 00:20:31.610
It must've felt like he living retirement rather than spending the final decade

348
00:20:31.611 --> 00:20:34.550
of his life. Resting on the laurels of the man who invented today.

349
00:20:34.730 --> 00:20:38.420
Andy started collaborating with many young talents in the underground art scene.

350
00:20:38.600 --> 00:20:41.420
His final gallery showing with data you're across the street from the nunnery,

351
00:20:41.421 --> 00:20:44.660
which houses Leonardo da Vinci's last supper fittingly enough.

352
00:20:44.660 --> 00:20:46.160
That last supper was the subject.

353
00:20:46.161 --> 00:20:49.450
Massive something Warhold hold must have delighted in because he returned to

354
00:20:49.451 --> 00:20:52.390
traditional brush painting. But the first time in 20 years,

355
00:20:52.510 --> 00:20:55.720
he and a collaborator basket yard produced well over a hundred works,

356
00:20:55.721 --> 00:20:57.130
including 10 punching bags,

357
00:20:57.131 --> 00:21:00.730
which featured the face of Jesus painted across 10 punching bags will all still

358
00:21:00.731 --> 00:21:04.870
holds the record for most works displayed on a single subject in February of

359
00:21:05.770 --> 00:21:05.800
1987.

360
00:21:05.800 --> 00:21:09.520
He died while recovering from what should have been routine gallbladder surgery,

361
00:21:09.610 --> 00:21:12.970
the public wake shut down, large portions of New York and Pittsburgh,

362
00:21:13.150 --> 00:21:17.260
where he was buried next to his parents of 58 years old for someone who had

363
00:21:17.261 --> 00:21:18.430
lived through so much,

364
00:21:18.460 --> 00:21:22.660
the depression world war two and assassination dying due to a moment's

365
00:21:22.661 --> 00:21:27.400
accidental neglect feels anticlimactic unfinished like a silk screen

366
00:21:27.820 --> 00:21:31.660
with two little paints. So I really hope you found that video. Interesting.
