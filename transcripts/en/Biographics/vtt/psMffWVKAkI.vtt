6
00:00:24.770 --> 00:00:27.870
The name of Alfred Russell Wallace probably doesn't mean much to you,

7
00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:30.750
but it really should. If you've heard of Charles Darwin,

8
00:00:30.980 --> 00:00:33.350
then you should also know Alfred Wallace,

9
00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:36.630
because really the two sort of did the same thing.

10
00:00:36.740 --> 00:00:41.340
That was a point when Darwin's famous theory of evolution was referred to as the

11
00:00:41.360 --> 00:00:43.780
Darwin Wallace theory of evolution. However,

12
00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:48.460
the latter contribution slowly but surely began to fade away from the public

13
00:00:48.461 --> 00:00:53.340
consciousness in a fitting example of publish or per Alfred

14
00:00:53.900 --> 00:00:57.340
Rossel Wallace was one of the most notable scientists of the 19th century.

15
00:00:57.720 --> 00:00:59.460
And he was more than just a naturalist.

16
00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:04.450
<v 1>He studied geography, Andro, ecology, and even astrobiology.</v>

17
00:01:04.630 --> 00:01:07.610
And to stop it all off, he was an auto died act. He was,

18
00:01:07.611 --> 00:01:12.530
self-taught more out of necessity than desire because he didn't come from money

19
00:01:12.830 --> 00:01:15.250
and couldn't afford a good education today.

20
00:01:15.251 --> 00:01:17.810
Alfred Russell receives some of the recognition.

21
00:01:17.811 --> 00:01:22.680
He richly deserves as we take a look at the life and the career of one

22
00:01:22.681 --> 00:01:24.960
of the luminaries of natural history.

23
00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:34.080
<v 0>Alfred Russell Wallace was born on January the eighth,</v>

24
00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:38.320
1823 at Kensington cottage near the town of us Monmouthshire,

25
00:01:38.410 --> 00:01:39.920
which is in Wales today.

26
00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:44.430
But back then was located in more of a gray area that some considered part of

27
00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:46.750
Wales and others considered a part of England.

28
00:01:47.060 --> 00:01:49.270
This might sound inconsequential to us,

29
00:01:49.370 --> 00:01:52.510
but some people have argued that this would make Wallace. We,

30
00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:56.710
while others believe that he was English, including Wallace himself,

31
00:01:56.770 --> 00:01:58.830
who always referred to himself as an Englishman,

32
00:01:58.930 --> 00:02:02.910
he was the eighth of nine children, Thomas veer, Wallace and Mary,

33
00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:04.040
and Grennell.

34
00:02:04.040 --> 00:02:07.740
His mother was English while his father was Scottish and claimed to be a

35
00:02:07.741 --> 00:02:09.620
descendant of the famed William Wallace.

36
00:02:10.100 --> 00:02:13.660
Although this was never attested conclusively. Speaking of him,

37
00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:17.660
we do have a video all about William Wallace. If you want to check that out,

38
00:02:17.661 --> 00:02:20.740
I'll put a link below birds backed Alfred. When he was young,

39
00:02:20.760 --> 00:02:24.890
his family moved around due to money troubles that would plague Wallace for most

40
00:02:24.891 --> 00:02:27.610
of his life before he was born. His parents lived in London,

41
00:02:27.790 --> 00:02:31.290
but relocated to Monmouth share to lower their cost of living.

42
00:02:32.010 --> 00:02:35.330
Thomas Wallace had a law degree, but for some reason never went into practice.

43
00:02:35.480 --> 00:02:39.050
Instead he relied on an inheritance for the first half of his adult life.

44
00:02:39.051 --> 00:02:40.250
And when that ran out,

45
00:02:40.251 --> 00:02:44.880
he attempted various business ventures that usually proved unsuccessful and left

46
00:02:44.881 --> 00:02:48.360
his family worse off than it was at the start. When Wallace was five,

47
00:02:48.380 --> 00:02:49.720
his parents, once again,

48
00:02:49.820 --> 00:02:54.400
set off for greener and cheaper pastures and relocated to Harford young Alfred

49
00:02:54.560 --> 00:02:56.560
enrolled at Richard ha's grammar school,

50
00:02:56.561 --> 00:02:59.280
where he received the only formal education of his life.

51
00:02:59.281 --> 00:03:02.160
Wallace never went to college because he never had the money,

52
00:03:02.260 --> 00:03:06.920
but this did not stop him from becoming a first class naturalist and Explorer.

53
00:03:07.150 --> 00:03:09.600
When Alfred was a teenager in 1837,

54
00:03:09.700 --> 00:03:13.280
his family's financial situation went from bad to worse.

55
00:03:13.330 --> 00:03:16.480
After his father basically lost everything in a swindle,

56
00:03:16.481 --> 00:03:18.830
they could not afford to keep Alfred in school mob.

57
00:03:18.930 --> 00:03:21.830
So instead they sent him to London to live with his older brother,

58
00:03:21.980 --> 00:03:24.710
John who had found an apprenticeship as a carpenter.

59
00:03:24.711 --> 00:03:26.990
Alfred only stayed there for a few months though,

60
00:03:26.991 --> 00:03:30.830
before leaving the capital and moving in with another of his brothers, William,

61
00:03:31.050 --> 00:03:33.270
who could take him on as an apprentice, Lance,

62
00:03:33.770 --> 00:03:37.590
the two Wallace brothers worked as surveyors for six years until business slowed

63
00:03:37.591 --> 00:03:42.580
down so much that a Alfred once again had to find new employment in 1844,

64
00:03:42.581 --> 00:03:45.700
he managed to poll's experience into a teaching position.

65
00:03:46.260 --> 00:03:49.380
That's the collegiate school in Lester, where he taught surveying.

66
00:03:49.381 --> 00:03:53.500
And mapmaking this proved to be a crucial moment for Wallace because he met a

67
00:03:53.501 --> 00:03:56.060
man who would have an enormous influence on his life.

68
00:03:56.350 --> 00:03:59.340
Henry Walter Bates at the time Bates,

69
00:03:59.890 --> 00:04:03.770
somewhat of a celebrity in the entomology world. He was only 19 years old,

70
00:04:03.950 --> 00:04:07.410
but already had a paper on Beatles published in the scientific journal.

71
00:04:07.670 --> 00:04:11.130
The zoologist Bateson Wallace struck up a friendship together.

72
00:04:11.230 --> 00:04:15.490
And the former sparks the latters interest in entomology Alfred's life took a

73
00:04:15.491 --> 00:04:18.450
turn in 1845 when his brother William died,

74
00:04:18.451 --> 00:04:23.320
suddenly he left his teaching in Lester and went to where William survey company

75
00:04:23.500 --> 00:04:26.960
was located and assumed control of the business. During these years,

76
00:04:26.961 --> 00:04:29.680
Wallace's interest in the natural world, increased greatly.

77
00:04:29.780 --> 00:04:33.840
He corresponded frequently with Bates and had become an insect collector

78
00:04:33.870 --> 00:04:34.700
himself.

79
00:04:34.700 --> 00:04:38.840
It was at this time that he first expressed an interest in evolution and wrote a

80
00:04:38.841 --> 00:04:40.790
letter to Bates from 1846, Evan,

81
00:04:40.860 --> 00:04:44.750
that he grew dissatisfied with the local selection of bugs and that he would

82
00:04:44.751 --> 00:04:48.990
like to take one family of insects and study it thoroughly with a view to the

83
00:04:48.991 --> 00:04:50.790
theory of the origin of species.

84
00:04:51.650 --> 00:04:55.350
His passion was aided by his new job being AOR meant that he would take long

85
00:04:55.351 --> 00:04:58.390
walks through the British countryside where he could explore at his leisure.

86
00:04:58.580 --> 00:05:02.340
What he didn't like though, was all the paperwork, the fee collection,

87
00:05:02.480 --> 00:05:05.900
and all the other bureaucratic responsibilities that came with the job.

88
00:05:05.901 --> 00:05:09.820
Wallace read up on the travels of naturalists who came before him such as

89
00:05:09.821 --> 00:05:14.340
Alexander Von Humboldt, or either FIFA or more relevant to us today.

90
00:05:14.370 --> 00:05:15.580
Charles Darwin,

91
00:05:15.720 --> 00:05:20.060
who had published the voyage of the be a few years prior Wallace realized that

92
00:05:20.061 --> 00:05:24.650
the only way for him to join their S was to travel to mysterious far away lands

93
00:05:24.651 --> 00:05:27.770
and see for himself what sites the natural world had to offer.

94
00:05:28.190 --> 00:05:32.570
His idea was met with great enthusiasm by Henry bat who became his traveling

95
00:05:32.571 --> 00:05:33.270
companion.

96
00:05:33.270 --> 00:05:36.610
The two concluded that they could fund their trip by selling specimens of

97
00:05:36.611 --> 00:05:40.250
insects and other animals that they found to British museums and private

98
00:05:40.890 --> 00:05:43.000
collectors. So in April, 1848,

99
00:05:43.060 --> 00:05:46.960
the young duo set off from Liverpool to the Amazon rainforest.

100
00:05:53.180 --> 00:05:58.160
The explorers landed in Belham a Brazilian port city that served as the gateway

101
00:05:58.340 --> 00:06:02.040
to the Amazon river in late may off, they went into the rainforest.

102
00:06:02.640 --> 00:06:06.240
Wallace Bates only explored together for a few months before deciding to go

103
00:06:06.400 --> 00:06:09.040
there separate ways. The reason for this is still unclear. Well,

104
00:06:09.070 --> 00:06:11.280
some historians pine, the two had a falling out.

105
00:06:11.281 --> 00:06:13.960
Others say that it was simply so they could cover more ground.

106
00:06:14.220 --> 00:06:15.600
It was just as well though,

107
00:06:15.601 --> 00:06:19.630
since baits ended up spending over a decade in the Amazon collecting insects

108
00:06:19.631 --> 00:06:23.630
while Wallace was there for less than half that time and diversified his

109
00:06:23.830 --> 00:06:26.550
interests, Wallace collected plenty of specimen. Sure.

110
00:06:26.610 --> 00:06:31.030
But he also studied the people. He encountered the languages and the cultures.

111
00:06:31.090 --> 00:06:34.670
He put his surveying experience to good use and chartered the Rio Negro.

112
00:06:34.690 --> 00:06:38.060
One of the Amazon's largest tributaries. More importantly though,

113
00:06:38.080 --> 00:06:41.140
he began developing his theory of natural selection.

114
00:06:41.200 --> 00:06:42.660
During this trip in particular,

115
00:06:43.140 --> 00:06:46.860
Wallace came to realize that geographical barriers are often congruous with

116
00:06:46.890 --> 00:06:48.060
species barriers,

117
00:06:48.061 --> 00:06:52.140
which makes sense when animals adapt and develop traits to suit their

118
00:06:52.141 --> 00:06:55.220
environments in 1852, Wallace was in poor health.

119
00:06:55.240 --> 00:06:58.290
So he decided that it was time to England. However,

120
00:06:58.470 --> 00:07:01.530
on the way there disaster struck one. After another,

121
00:07:01.760 --> 00:07:04.010
once he reached civilization back in Brazil,

122
00:07:04.011 --> 00:07:06.410
he found out that his younger brother Herbert had died.

123
00:07:06.590 --> 00:07:08.930
The sibling had also come to explore the Amerson,

124
00:07:08.931 --> 00:07:13.410
but did so mostly on his own in 1851, Herbert intended to head back to England,

125
00:07:13.510 --> 00:07:15.850
but Courty yellow fever and passed away.

126
00:07:16.120 --> 00:07:20.040
Then Alfred Wallace discovered that all the specimens he had sent back for the

127
00:07:20.041 --> 00:07:21.120
last two years of his trip,

128
00:07:21.320 --> 00:07:25.640
it never made it out of Brazil and were instead delayed at a dark in Manos.

129
00:07:26.000 --> 00:07:28.960
Wallace had a secure passage for himself and the bulk of his collection,

130
00:07:28.980 --> 00:07:32.480
but another tragedy occurred while he was in the middle of the Atlantic ocean.

131
00:07:32.660 --> 00:07:35.360
The Chevy was on board, caught fire and sank.

132
00:07:35.361 --> 00:07:39.710
There were no vitalities as the crew and passengers managed to for 10 days in

133
00:07:39.711 --> 00:07:43.310
lifeboats until a cargo ship passed by and rescued them. However,

134
00:07:43.690 --> 00:07:47.670
all of Wallace's specimens and all of his notes were lost to the bottom of the

135
00:07:47.671 --> 00:07:48.170
ocean,

136
00:07:48.170 --> 00:07:51.870
except for just a couple of notebooks that he managed to save back in London.

137
00:07:51.871 --> 00:07:54.510
Wallace had a thing along and hard about his next step.

138
00:07:54.690 --> 00:07:58.030
The bulk of the collection, the gathered in the Amazon may have been destroyed,

139
00:07:58.031 --> 00:08:00.220
but fortunately the, it was partially insured.

140
00:08:00.320 --> 00:08:04.460
So the naturalist had some breathing room financially, despite losing his notes.

141
00:08:04.780 --> 00:08:07.380
Wallace knew enough that he wrote several academic papers,

142
00:08:07.390 --> 00:08:11.460
which were well received and helped establish him among British naturalists.

143
00:08:11.940 --> 00:08:15.540
You might think that the ends of the Amazonian trip might have put him off

144
00:08:15.770 --> 00:08:20.610
exploring, but Wallace was soon ready to go back out again. And in 1854,

145
00:08:20.970 --> 00:08:25.610
he set off for the Malay archipelago, better known back then as the east Indies.

146
00:08:26.190 --> 00:08:27.610
But before we get into that journey,

147
00:08:27.870 --> 00:08:31.570
let me tell you something about today's sponsor, curiosity stream,

148
00:08:31.571 --> 00:08:35.250
curiosity stream is a subscription streaming service that offers over 2000

153
00:08:49.540 --> 00:08:53.960
cradle, which as you might guess from the title is all about humanities earlier

154
00:08:53.990 --> 00:08:56.840
ancestors and how they evolved into us.

155
00:08:56.950 --> 00:09:00.360

Lots of you reach out to me and tell you how much you are enjoying curiosity

167
00:09:36.120 --> 00:09:40.380
stream. So great fit for this channel. And, uh, let's get back to it. Shall we,

168
00:09:46.570 --> 00:09:50.180
This trip proved to be far more fruitful for Wallace who spent the next eight

169
00:09:50.181 --> 00:09:51.100
years of his life there.

170
00:09:51.120 --> 00:09:55.850
He collected well over 120,000 spare and sent them back to England times,

171
00:09:55.851 --> 00:09:58.850
employing up to 100 assistants to travel.

172
00:09:58.910 --> 00:10:03.450
The acapella go far and wide in search of curious species of animals among them

173
00:10:03.451 --> 00:10:07.770
was a young boy named ally who went into Wallace's employer while the naturalist

174
00:10:07.790 --> 00:10:10.890
was in Singapore. He started off doing the cooking and cleaning,

175
00:10:10.910 --> 00:10:14.170
but learned from his employer and began accompanying him on journeys.

176
00:10:14.171 --> 00:10:17.320
And eventually went out alone, looking for specimens to study.

177
00:10:17.460 --> 00:10:19.280
He ended up being Wallace's most faithful,

178
00:10:19.281 --> 00:10:22.440
servant and collected and prepared over 5,000 animals.

179
00:10:22.550 --> 00:10:25.840
Many of which still stood in natural history. Museums around the world.

180
00:10:25.841 --> 00:10:30.560
Wallace described him as the faithful companion of almost all his journeying

181
00:10:30.610 --> 00:10:32.360
among the islands of the far east,

182
00:10:32.620 --> 00:10:36.400
the boy married while working for the naturalist and took the name Ali Wallace

183
00:10:37.010 --> 00:10:37.910
unsurprisingly.

184
00:10:37.910 --> 00:10:41.750
During his time in the east Indies Wallace discovered and described many new

185
00:10:41.751 --> 00:10:42.584
animal species.

186
00:10:42.770 --> 00:10:46.030
He also observed that there seemed to be a significant change in the wildlife.

187
00:10:46.220 --> 00:10:49.350
When you traveled between the islands of Bali and Loach,

188
00:10:49.530 --> 00:10:53.950
the short stretch of water that separates those two land masses is now known as

189
00:10:53.951 --> 00:10:58.300
the Wallace line and is regarded as the natural park audition between the Asian

190
00:10:58.520 --> 00:11:02.740
and Australian wildlife Wallace chronicled his entire expedition and all his

191
00:11:02.770 --> 00:11:05.660
observances in a book titled the Malay archipelago.

192
00:11:05.800 --> 00:11:10.340
He published it in 1869 and it became a big hit and seen as one of the most

193
00:11:10.341 --> 00:11:12.780
significant science books of the 19th century.

194
00:11:19.470 --> 00:11:20.000
Of course,

195
00:11:20.000 --> 00:11:24.570
Wallace's biggest achievement was his work on the theory of evolution by 1855,

196
00:11:24.590 --> 00:11:28.250
he already became convinced that living things could evolve over long periods of

197
00:11:28.251 --> 00:11:31.690
time, but he didn't understand the mechanism behind this natural process.

198
00:11:31.910 --> 00:11:34.290
Yet the answer came to him in 1858.

199
00:11:34.490 --> 00:11:38.440
Our he fell ill with fever and suffered hallucinations. Once the, it broke.

200
00:11:38.441 --> 00:11:42.800
Wallace had a bit of a Eureka moment and realized that species evolve in order

201
00:11:42.820 --> 00:11:47.000
to adapt to their environment. This revelation prompted him to act immediately.

202
00:11:47.060 --> 00:11:50.480
He wrote down his theory in a short paper and sent it to a colleague of his and

203
00:11:50.510 --> 00:11:53.520
another expert in the field to review it before publication.

204
00:11:53.950 --> 00:11:57.000
That person was Charles Darwin. Now, to be clear,

205
00:11:57.010 --> 00:12:01.000
we're not suggesting that Darwin stole any of Wallace's work or even that the

206
00:12:01.001 --> 00:12:03.120
two were competing against one another. In fact,

207
00:12:03.140 --> 00:12:07.240
one of the main reasons why Wallace sent his ideas to Darwin was because he knew

208
00:12:07.241 --> 00:12:09.560
that the other naturalist was studying something similar.

209
00:12:09.780 --> 00:12:12.280
Darwin also had some previous work in the form of a letter,

210
00:12:12.610 --> 00:12:13.750
an unpublished essay,

211
00:12:13.760 --> 00:12:17.270
which attested to the fact that he developed his ideas independently,

212
00:12:17.420 --> 00:12:20.670
even so Darwin realized that some controversy may arise.

213
00:12:20.690 --> 00:12:23.350
So he asked his colleagues, uh, Charles Lyle.

214
00:12:23.351 --> 00:12:26.750
And so Joseph Dalton for advice in the end,

215
00:12:26.751 --> 00:12:29.710
they decided that Darwin and Wallace should write a joint article,

216
00:12:29.720 --> 00:12:34.420
comprising both their scientific papers, therefore on lie. The first 1858,

217
00:12:34.480 --> 00:12:39.380
the line society of London heard a presentation on as a tendency of species to

218
00:12:39.381 --> 00:12:44.060
form varieties and on the perpetuation of varieties and species by natural

219
00:12:44.150 --> 00:12:46.900
means of selection. Wallace was still in the east Indies.

220
00:12:46.901 --> 00:12:48.980
So he wasn't there to share his findings in person,

221
00:12:49.080 --> 00:12:53.730
but this represented the first announcement of the Darwin Wallace theory of

222
00:12:53.731 --> 00:12:55.690
evolution by natural selection.

223
00:12:55.990 --> 00:13:00.090
The paper appeared in print one month later because the paper stirred enough

224
00:13:00.330 --> 00:13:00.571
interest,

225
00:13:00.571 --> 00:13:05.210
Charles Darwin decided to take the big books that he was working on and condense

226
00:13:05.211 --> 00:13:08.930
it into an abstract that was easier to take in by the average reader.

227
00:13:09.330 --> 00:13:12.730
He published it the next year with the title on the origin of species.

228
00:13:13.090 --> 00:13:18.000
Needless to say that book was quite successful and indeed became the defining

229
00:13:18.030 --> 00:13:19.880
work on the theory of evolution.

230
00:13:20.150 --> 00:13:24.360
That is how Charles Darwin's name became inexorably linked with this notion

231
00:13:24.570 --> 00:13:27.520
while Alfred Wallace was slowly pushed to the site,

232
00:13:27.780 --> 00:13:30.240
it probably didn't help that Wallace seemed to know,

233
00:13:30.400 --> 00:13:32.760
hurry to capitalize on his newfound successes.

234
00:13:32.860 --> 00:13:37.190
It was still interested in still the bio of the Maar Pao.

235
00:13:37.191 --> 00:13:38.630
After this paper was published.

236
00:13:38.690 --> 00:13:42.950
He still spent another four years in the east Indies before finally returning to

237
00:13:42.951 --> 00:13:44.230
London back in England,

238
00:13:44.231 --> 00:13:47.030
Wallace began giving presentations on the theory of evolution.

239
00:13:47.290 --> 00:13:51.070
He met Anne's prevented Darwin as well as many other scientists who were eager

240
00:13:51.071 --> 00:13:52.670
to ask questions and praise.

241
00:13:52.990 --> 00:13:57.100
The naturalist for his work Wallace was given more or less every science award

242
00:13:57.101 --> 00:13:57.934
under the sun.

243
00:13:58.160 --> 00:14:01.780
So it's not like the scientific community was trying to deny or diminish his

244
00:14:01.781 --> 00:14:02.614
accomplishments.

245
00:14:02.680 --> 00:14:06.020
It was just unfortunate timing that doomed him to semi obscurity.

246
00:14:06.170 --> 00:14:07.380
When he returned from his trip,

247
00:14:07.400 --> 00:14:10.900
he dedicated his efforts towards writing the Malay archipelago.

248
00:14:11.240 --> 00:14:14.500
By the time he published contributions to the theory of natural selection,

249
00:14:14.780 --> 00:14:19.650
a series of as 18, 18 70, the public already associated Darwin with evolution.

250
00:14:19.950 --> 00:14:21.810
And it was too late to change their minds,

251
00:14:28.210 --> 00:14:30.330
Explorations and evolution aside.

252
00:14:30.331 --> 00:14:33.770
Wallace had been involved in a few other interesting episodes that merit

253
00:14:33.820 --> 00:14:36.960
discussion. One of them known as the Bedford level experiment.

254
00:14:36.980 --> 00:14:41.120
He came to regard as the most regrettable incident in his life when he tried to

255
00:14:41.121 --> 00:14:43.800
prove to a flat earth that the planet was round, but Wallace,

256
00:14:44.000 --> 00:14:48.680
his thought would be an afternoon of work and easy money turned into 15 years of

257
00:14:48.750 --> 00:14:51.840
continued worry litigation and persecution.

258
00:14:52.100 --> 00:14:56.760
It all started in 80 38 with a convinced flat Arthur named Samuel robo,

259
00:14:57.220 --> 00:15:01.560
who made a series of observations along the old Bedford river in the fenlands of

260
00:15:01.720 --> 00:15:05.000
C, which he claimed proved that the earth was flat.

261
00:15:05.220 --> 00:15:08.960
He watched a Boze with a flag tied to its mask three feet above water level,

262
00:15:09.480 --> 00:15:13.030
sail in a straight line in for six miles. According to his calculations,

263
00:15:13.090 --> 00:15:15.310
the flag should have dipped below his line of sight,

264
00:15:15.311 --> 00:15:18.310
eight inches for every mile. It traveled. If the earth was curved,

265
00:15:18.530 --> 00:15:19.910
it stayed at the same level. However,

266
00:15:20.060 --> 00:15:24.950
showing that the planet was flat in reality, any engineer, severe or physicist,

267
00:15:24.951 --> 00:15:27.630
would've been able to spot robot's mistake.

268
00:15:27.890 --> 00:15:31.540
He placed his telescope only eight inches above the water level and did not

269
00:15:31.541 --> 00:15:34.700
account for atmospheric refraction, which causes light to deviate us.

270
00:15:34.880 --> 00:15:38.540
It passes through our atmosphere because the ad density changes at different

271
00:15:38.541 --> 00:15:39.380
Heights, even.

272
00:15:39.400 --> 00:15:44.060
So Rob was happy with his findings and published them under the pseudonym para,

273
00:15:44.610 --> 00:15:47.340
then nothing happens for a few decades until 1870.

274
00:15:47.410 --> 00:15:51.460
When Rob's experiments found an enthusiastic supporter in a religious,

275
00:15:51.530 --> 00:15:52.850
an addict named John Hampton,

276
00:15:53.610 --> 00:15:57.530
Hampton had been converted by another flat earth named William Carpenter and

277
00:15:57.531 --> 00:16:00.970
quickly became obsessed with defending Genesis to the hilt.

278
00:16:01.070 --> 00:16:05.090
He was convinced that any notion that went against the literal word of the Bible

279
00:16:05.430 --> 00:16:08.370
was nonsense that needed to be eradicated from society.

280
00:16:08.630 --> 00:16:12.240
He also had a lot of resources and free time on his hands. Thanks to you.

281
00:16:12.360 --> 00:16:14.240
A generous inheritance from his father.

282
00:16:14.570 --> 00:16:19.480
Eventually ham wanted to put his money where his mouth was and placed a wager in

283
00:16:19.481 --> 00:16:20.760
the journal scientific opinion.

284
00:16:20.940 --> 00:16:25.720
He was willing to bet anywhere between 50 to 500 pounds that no man of science

285
00:16:25.721 --> 00:16:30.720
would be able to prove to him and a referee that a canal river lake or

286
00:16:30.790 --> 00:16:34.070
railway was convex. Alfred Wallace saw the notice.

287
00:16:34.330 --> 00:16:37.950
And since he had never been a rich man considered it easy money,

288
00:16:38.130 --> 00:16:41.550
he even consulted a friend and esteemed colleague, Charles Lyle,

289
00:16:41.551 --> 00:16:44.550
who encouraged him to stop these foolish people.

290
00:16:44.660 --> 00:16:46.790
Wallace in Hampton began conversing.

291
00:16:46.810 --> 00:16:49.270
And at first it seems like the matter would be straightforward.

292
00:16:49.271 --> 00:16:51.830
Wallace proposed. They used by lake for their means,

293
00:16:51.970 --> 00:16:54.420
but Hampton in insisted on Bedford river,

294
00:16:54.560 --> 00:16:58.420
the same stretch of water that unbeknownst to the naturalist had been used by

295
00:16:58.860 --> 00:17:00.100
robo 30 years prior.

296
00:17:00.210 --> 00:17:03.540
They also agreed that the referee should be an editor of a science journal,

297
00:17:03.860 --> 00:17:07.660
a Lance civil engineer, or member of the Royal geographical society.

298
00:17:08.100 --> 00:17:09.740
They settled on John Henry Wall shed,

299
00:17:10.020 --> 00:17:13.380
a fields magazine who knew neither man had had no stakes in the debate.

300
00:17:13.880 --> 00:17:16.770
Then things started to go wrong. For starters,

301
00:17:16.771 --> 00:17:20.650
even though both men agreed on Walsh's referee Hamden insisted,

302
00:17:20.651 --> 00:17:24.330
there would be a second referee of his choosing. He selected William Carpenter,

303
00:17:24.350 --> 00:17:26.330
the same flat author who converted him.

304
00:17:26.550 --> 00:17:29.650
Not only did he not have any of the qualifications agreed upon,

305
00:17:29.830 --> 00:17:34.010
he was about as far removed from impartial, as you could possib.

306
00:17:34.190 --> 00:17:38.280
Imagine Wallace made two crucial modifications to the original Bedford level

307
00:17:38.290 --> 00:17:39.060
experiment.

308
00:17:39.060 --> 00:17:42.760
He placed his Sightline 13 feet above water to minimize the effects of

309
00:17:42.761 --> 00:17:46.520
refraction and put a long pole at the halfway mark to make it easier to see the

310
00:17:46.521 --> 00:17:48.240
curvature between the two end points.

311
00:17:48.500 --> 00:17:52.040
Unsurprisingly experiment correctly showed that the earth was rounds,

312
00:17:52.041 --> 00:17:53.840
but his opponents were not satisfied.

313
00:17:54.030 --> 00:17:58.280
They kept demanding changes and Wallace acquiesced to all of their requests,

314
00:17:58.281 --> 00:18:02.000
knowing full well that none of them would magically flatten the planet.

315
00:18:02.430 --> 00:18:05.480
Half days work soon turned into a week, but in the end,

316
00:18:05.600 --> 00:18:10.310
a Walsh decided in favor of Wallace and the article Hamden through a fit.

317
00:18:10.530 --> 00:18:13.270
He demanded his money back saying that he had been cheated.

318
00:18:13.290 --> 00:18:15.870
And when the scientist refused, he took him to court.

319
00:18:16.060 --> 00:18:20.670
What followed was 15 years of protracted legal battles into harassment

320
00:18:20.950 --> 00:18:25.230
campaigns that went so extreme that they eventually landed Hampton in jail.

321
00:18:25.580 --> 00:18:28.070
Even though at one point he had gotten his money back.

322
00:18:28.550 --> 00:18:30.860
Hamden would not stopped tormenting Alfred Wallace,

323
00:18:31.170 --> 00:18:34.660
none of his friends and family members were safe either as the flat earth sent

324
00:18:34.661 --> 00:18:39.100
them all vitriol letters to crying that they would have a relationship with a

325
00:18:39.150 --> 00:18:43.860
lying feral thief and a convicted felon, such as Wallace. At one point,

326
00:18:43.880 --> 00:18:47.740
he even sent a death threat to the naturalist's wife saying that he will ensure

327
00:18:47.741 --> 00:18:52.610
that Wallace never dies in his and instead will one day be carried home

328
00:18:52.800 --> 00:18:55.850
with every bone in his head smashed to pulp.

329
00:18:56.120 --> 00:18:59.810
This went too far and TA was imprisoned, but in the end,

330
00:18:59.830 --> 00:19:03.970
the whole ordeal cost wallers a lot of time effort and hundreds of pounds in

331
00:19:03.971 --> 00:19:04.804
legal fees.

332
00:19:10.830 --> 00:19:14.920
Perhaps one of the reasons why Wallace was not as well known as Darwin was his

333
00:19:14.921 --> 00:19:17.240
reluctance to dedicate himself to a single topic.

334
00:19:17.760 --> 00:19:21.360
He was sometimes called the grand old man of science because he studied and

335
00:19:21.370 --> 00:19:23.080
wrote about many different subjects.

336
00:19:23.220 --> 00:19:26.240
He was an early environmentalist and even 150 years ago,

337
00:19:26.241 --> 00:19:30.950
he warned that human activities such as large scale deforestation and erosion

338
00:19:31.260 --> 00:19:33.270
will have a negative impact on the climate.

339
00:19:33.271 --> 00:19:37.470
Wallace became an even more th fervent environmental advocate as the decades

340
00:19:37.530 --> 00:19:40.990
rolled on in the world of life published a few years before his death,

341
00:19:40.991 --> 00:19:44.670
Wallace accused all the greatest nations claiming the first place for

342
00:19:44.671 --> 00:19:49.630
civilization and religion of causing widespread Rav of the Earth's surface on

343
00:19:49.631 --> 00:19:52.620
a scale never seen, but four awesome. In his later years,

344
00:19:52.860 --> 00:19:56.460
Wallace turned his attention towards the sky and wanted if there was any life

345
00:19:56.461 --> 00:20:00.940
out there. He wrote a book in 1904 titled man's place in the universe,

346
00:20:00.990 --> 00:20:05.060
which represented one of the first scientific attempts to examine planetary

347
00:20:05.061 --> 00:20:05.880
habitability.

348
00:20:05.880 --> 00:20:09.500
He concluded earth was the only planet suitable for life in the solar system,

349
00:20:09.501 --> 00:20:13.490
because it was the only one that could stain liquid water. A few years later,

350
00:20:13.491 --> 00:20:16.850
Wallace wrote a second book on the subject, focusing on Mars.

351
00:20:17.040 --> 00:20:21.530
That was at a time when a man named Peral Lao stirred the public into a frenzy

352
00:20:21.550 --> 00:20:25.890
by claiming there were canals on Mars built by an intelligence species Wallace's

353
00:20:25.891 --> 00:20:28.770
book, debunked, the claim. And obviously he was later proven,

354
00:20:28.771 --> 00:20:33.360
correct when higher quality telescopes revealed the canal to just be optical

355
00:20:33.560 --> 00:20:37.360
illusions Wallace also held some controversial beliefs that often strained his

356
00:20:37.361 --> 00:20:39.200
relationships with fellow scientists.

357
00:20:39.300 --> 00:20:43.160
He was a devoted believer in spiritualism and had investigated it for decades.

358
00:20:43.470 --> 00:20:45.600
Mesmerism sounds his spirit photography.

359
00:20:45.700 --> 00:20:48.160
He believed in all of them to various degrees,

360
00:20:48.390 --> 00:20:49.960
even some of his closest colleagues,

361
00:20:49.961 --> 00:20:54.160
such as Henry Bates and Charles Darwin thought the Wallace was being stubbornly

362
00:20:54.161 --> 00:20:54.780
credulous.

363
00:20:54.780 --> 00:20:58.160
And it did have an effect on his reputation within the scientific community.

364
00:20:58.540 --> 00:21:00.240
At one point, it almost cost Wallace,

365
00:21:00.440 --> 00:21:02.480
a civil pension that he desperately needed.

366
00:21:02.860 --> 00:21:06.440
And it was mainly thanks to Darwin's interference that he received it in the

367
00:21:06.740 --> 00:21:10.550
perhaps even more controversial and certainly more pertinent to our times.

368
00:21:10.650 --> 00:21:14.670
Alfred Wallace was also part of the anti-vaccination movement in Victor,

369
00:21:14.830 --> 00:21:15.151
in England,

370
00:21:15.151 --> 00:21:19.110
particularly he was against mandatory vaccination for small parks because he

371
00:21:19.111 --> 00:21:21.430
felt it would disturb the balance of nature. Again,

372
00:21:21.460 --> 00:21:24.630
this landed him in hot water with many of his scientific colleagues,

373
00:21:25.020 --> 00:21:29.260
despite his Folies Wallace remained active all his life writing almost two dozen

374
00:21:29.261 --> 00:21:33.300
books and over 500 scientific papers. He died on November the seventh,

375
00:21:33.700 --> 00:21:38.340
1913 at the age of 90 in his home in Broadstone in the English countryside.

376
00:21:38.470 --> 00:21:40.820
There were calls to bury him Westminster Rady,

377
00:21:41.140 --> 00:21:43.740
but Wallace was buried and the local Broadstone cemetery,

378
00:21:43.741 --> 00:21:48.170
according to his wishes while medallion was placed at Westminster next to

379
00:21:48.171 --> 00:21:51.010
Charles Darwin. So I really hope you found that video. Interesting.
