<v 0>This episode is brought to you by grounds news.</v>

2
00:00:02.341 --> 00:00:06.690
Ground news is an app that is dedicated to fighting misinformation and bias

3
00:00:06.700 --> 00:00:10.560
news, which I think we all know is a bit of a problem in today's media.

4
00:00:10.590 --> 00:00:12.510
It's really harder than ever out there to work out.

5
00:00:12.511 --> 00:00:14.850
What is really happening in the news.

6
00:00:14.851 --> 00:00:18.510
Ground news allows you to filter the news by political bias.

7
00:00:18.511 --> 00:00:22.800
So you can jump into the app and you can see the same story being brought to you

8
00:00:22.801 --> 00:00:25.830
by left-wing center. And right-wing sources.

9
00:00:25.860 --> 00:00:29.250
This allows you to understand the different perspectives and form your own

10
00:00:29.251 --> 00:00:31.500
opinion about what's going on in the world.

11
00:00:31.620 --> 00:00:35.190
They've gotten used from over 40,000 news outlets from around the world.

12
00:00:35.191 --> 00:00:39.030
So you can not only see the political bias of a piece of reporting,

13
00:00:39.060 --> 00:00:42.750
but also how it might be reported differently in a different country.

14
00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:46.920
Ground news is a free app available from both the Apple app store and the Google

15
00:00:46.921 --> 00:00:49.620
play store. Just click the link in the description below,

16
00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:51.240
and let's get into the video.

17
00:00:57.530 --> 00:01:01.400
It's the biggest scandal in us history on August the eighth, 1974,

18
00:01:01.520 --> 00:01:06.500
Richard Milhous Nixon became the first ever president to resign mere days before

19
00:01:06.501 --> 00:01:07.640
Congress could impeach him.

20
00:01:07.730 --> 00:01:12.350
The cause of this epoch shaping events was the Watergate scandal and attempted

21
00:01:12.351 --> 00:01:16.580
wiretapping of the democratic national election headquarters and its subsequent

22
00:01:16.581 --> 00:01:20.750
coverup. Even now after four decades of scandals, as varied as Iran,

23
00:01:20.780 --> 00:01:24.650
Contra Monica Lewinsky, and one of the hell was happening in 2016,

24
00:01:25.220 --> 00:01:29.090
Watergate remains the gold standard of high crimes and misdemeanors Gators even

25
00:01:29.091 --> 00:01:32.360
entered the lexicon as a suffix denoting scandal.

26
00:01:32.420 --> 00:01:34.550
But while most of us are aware of Watergate,

27
00:01:34.580 --> 00:01:37.400
how much do we really know about the man behind the door?

28
00:01:37.490 --> 00:01:39.830
Born into a blue collar family in 1913,

29
00:01:39.980 --> 00:01:43.850
Richard Nixon was a natural political animal throughout his house and Senate

30
00:01:43.851 --> 00:01:44.241
careers.

31
00:01:44.241 --> 00:01:48.230
He under reputation as a formidable opponent first designs and how his VP Denis

32
00:01:48.231 --> 00:01:49.520
presidents in his own, right?

33
00:01:49.521 --> 00:01:53.780
He oversaw initiatives that transformed America yet the 37th president would

34
00:01:53.781 --> 00:01:58.370
wind up dynamiting his own legacy in the most dramatic way possible flawed

35
00:01:58.670 --> 00:02:03.350
paranoid brilliance. This is the tale of Richard Nixon. The most controversial.

36
00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:04.753
<v 1>Precedence.</v>

37
00:02:10.910 --> 00:02:15.560
<v 0>Tire of saying the 37th president came from a hard background born on January</v>

38
00:02:15.561 --> 00:02:19.250
the ninth, 1913 in Yorba Linda, California, Richard Milhous,

39
00:02:19.251 --> 00:02:22.070
Nixon grew up not in a fancy mansion,

40
00:02:22.100 --> 00:02:25.940
but rather in a modest home that he shared with four siblings is perpetually

41
00:02:25.941 --> 00:02:26.301
angry.

42
00:02:26.301 --> 00:02:30.920
Father Frank owned a service station and a small feeling citrus farm that never

43
00:02:30.950 --> 00:02:34.730
brought in much more than a handful of pennies as Nixon would later reminisce,

44
00:02:34.790 --> 00:02:37.790
we were poor, but the glory of it was that we didn't know it.

45
00:02:37.850 --> 00:02:41.630
However you could argue this statement was not entirely accurate for his entire

46
00:02:41.631 --> 00:02:42.320
adult life.

47
00:02:42.320 --> 00:02:46.480
Nixon would privately rail against those born with a silver spoon in their mouth

48
00:02:46.610 --> 00:02:50.900
as the Kennedys or the wealthy New York Jews that he perceived as enemies.

49
00:02:50.960 --> 00:02:52.910
Young Nixon may well have been poor,

50
00:02:53.120 --> 00:02:56.000
but he very much seemed to know it still,

51
00:02:56.030 --> 00:02:59.800
this wasn't the source of grinding soul sapping poverty that hollows you out.

52
00:03:00.040 --> 00:03:02.590
Growing up Nixon found time to read stacks of books,

53
00:03:02.591 --> 00:03:06.640
run for class president and engage as quake a mother in energetic debates.

54
00:03:06.820 --> 00:03:10.630
It was in these good-natured arguments that he got his first taste of politics.

55
00:03:10.870 --> 00:03:14.620
The dawning of the 1920s brought a string of bad news for the Nixon family.

56
00:03:14.680 --> 00:03:15.011
First,

57
00:03:15.011 --> 00:03:18.640
the family citrus farm went under forcing them to leave their home and move to

58
00:03:18.641 --> 00:03:19.480
nearby Whittier.

59
00:03:19.660 --> 00:03:24.610
Then Nixon's youngest brother Arthur died in 1925 aged only seven a few years

60
00:03:24.611 --> 00:03:25.720
later, his oldest brother,

61
00:03:25.721 --> 00:03:30.250
Harold also passed away suffering a long and lingering death from tuberculosis.

62
00:03:30.520 --> 00:03:32.560
It was a traumatic time for the family,

63
00:03:32.590 --> 00:03:36.040
but you wouldn't know it from looking at Nixon Whittier high school.

64
00:03:36.041 --> 00:03:39.430
The boy was excelling eventually graduating second in his class,

65
00:03:39.640 --> 00:03:42.010
he was offered a scholarship to Harvard, but alas,

66
00:03:42.020 --> 00:03:43.960
the family was too poor to send them away.

67
00:03:44.050 --> 00:03:47.230
Instead Nixon had to make do with a local Quaker college.

68
00:03:47.290 --> 00:03:51.010
Still the boy applied himself, earning a reputation as a debate champion,

69
00:03:51.011 --> 00:03:54.280
a great football player and a charismatic character in the school's drama

70
00:03:54.281 --> 00:03:56.750
productions. When he graduated in 1934,

71
00:03:56.780 --> 00:04:01.540
Nixon was so red hot that Duke university's law school practically threw a

72
00:04:01.541 --> 00:04:03.400
scholarship at him by 1937,

73
00:04:03.401 --> 00:04:06.820
Nixon was a 24 year old qualified lawyer with some of the best grades in the

74
00:04:06.821 --> 00:04:10.180
whole state. He should have been set for life after that,

75
00:04:10.360 --> 00:04:13.690
but things weren't so easy for a boy from a hardscrabble background,

76
00:04:13.780 --> 00:04:16.990
every prestigious law firm next and applied to turn him down,

77
00:04:17.080 --> 00:04:19.000
stung Nixon slunk back to Whittier.

78
00:04:19.060 --> 00:04:22.630
He moved in above his parents' garage and got a dead end job at a small law firm

79
00:04:22.631 --> 00:04:25.900
and just contemplated how unfair life was here.

80
00:04:25.901 --> 00:04:30.580
He was a gifted boy with the grades to match to summit because why?

81
00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:32.590
Because his parents didn't have any money.

82
00:04:32.710 --> 00:04:35.740
But while returning to Whittier would leave a bitter taste that Nixon would

83
00:04:35.741 --> 00:04:39.670
never shake. It did at least have one positive outcome. In 1938,

84
00:04:39.671 --> 00:04:44.110
Nixon joined a local community theater there as a rehearsal on January the 18th,

85
00:04:44.230 --> 00:04:47.440
he met Thelma. Katherine Ryan known to our friends is Pat.

86
00:04:47.441 --> 00:04:50.980
She was glamorous beguiling after driving our home that evening,

87
00:04:50.981 --> 00:04:54.700
the young lawyer declared I'd like to have a date with you to which she replied.

88
00:04:55.210 --> 00:04:59.320
I'm busy, not exactly a fairytale romance starting right there,

89
00:04:59.321 --> 00:05:03.430
but Nixon persevered when he heard pats enjoyed ice skating sport had never

90
00:05:03.431 --> 00:05:07.270
tried. He spent weeks forcing himself to learn how to skate just so he could

91
00:05:07.300 --> 00:05:10.840
accidentally meet her at the rink. Finally, after a year as just friends,

92
00:05:10.841 --> 00:05:15.550
Pat caved. And she agreed to that date on the 21st of June, 1940 next and,

93
00:05:15.640 --> 00:05:17.170
and Pat were married together.

94
00:05:17.200 --> 00:05:20.860
They agreed to keep chasing their dreams to keep being ambitious.

95
00:05:20.890 --> 00:05:23.650
Two years later, they moved from California to Washington DC,

96
00:05:23.800 --> 00:05:26.350
where Nixon got a job in the office of price administration.

97
00:05:26.410 --> 00:05:29.440
It was the 29 year old's first foray into the world of politics.

98
00:05:29.470 --> 00:05:32.110
And it certainly was not going to be as lost

99
00:05:39.120 --> 00:05:43.260
Nixon lasted less than a year in the office of price administration and FDR new

100
00:05:43.261 --> 00:05:45.930
deal program. It was the embodiment of big government,

101
00:05:45.931 --> 00:05:50.550
something that chilled Nixon to his soul and he quit and discussed rather than

102
00:05:50.880 --> 00:05:52.680
return to practicing law. He joined the Navy.

103
00:05:53.010 --> 00:05:55.500
This was a pretty impressive thing to do as a Quaker.

104
00:05:55.501 --> 00:05:59.360
Nixon was exempt from serving of a get out of jail free card,

105
00:05:59.361 --> 00:06:02.120
considering the massive bloody war going on,

106
00:06:02.210 --> 00:06:05.210
but Nixon enlisted regardless serving in the Pacific.

107
00:06:05.480 --> 00:06:07.040
Although he never saw combat,

108
00:06:07.041 --> 00:06:10.400
he still managed to pick up two service dogs before resigning his commission in

109
00:06:10.401 --> 00:06:11.810
January, 1946,

110
00:06:12.140 --> 00:06:15.870
barely had Nixon swapped his starched white uniform for a dull gray suits.

111
00:06:16.070 --> 00:06:19.640
Then a group of Republicans from his hometown approached him with an interesting

112
00:06:19.641 --> 00:06:21.620
proposition. Five term Democrats.

113
00:06:22.040 --> 00:06:25.550
Jerry voyeurs was up for reelection in California's 12th district,

114
00:06:25.610 --> 00:06:27.230
despite being soft on communism,

115
00:06:27.260 --> 00:06:31.160
no Republican had ever been able to unseat him butts with a war hero as their

116
00:06:31.161 --> 00:06:35.990
candidate. Then maybe just maybe it was possible throughout 1946,

117
00:06:35.991 --> 00:06:38.540
Nixon went for the election with the same bloody mindedness.

118
00:06:38.660 --> 00:06:41.900
It shown pursuing Pat despite his reputation, voices,

119
00:06:41.901 --> 00:06:45.590
actual connections to communism non-existence so Nixon,

120
00:06:46.010 --> 00:06:49.340
why don't he just made them up at a town hall debate and Nixon flourished a

121
00:06:49.490 --> 00:06:53.480
scrap of paper, supposedly linking voyeurs to a communist blinked pack.

122
00:06:53.540 --> 00:06:57.110
Nevermind that Nixon was actually talking about a completely different pack and

123
00:06:57.260 --> 00:07:00.950
never mind that voice was against communism in voters' minds.

124
00:07:01.190 --> 00:07:05.960
The Democrats was now a read come November. They voted for Nixon in droves.

125
00:07:06.020 --> 00:07:08.840
It was Nixon's first experience with negative campaigning.

126
00:07:08.900 --> 00:07:11.180
The art of not making yourself look good,

127
00:07:11.181 --> 00:07:14.300
but rather making your opponent look worse. And well,

128
00:07:14.360 --> 00:07:18.500
Nixon was a bit of a genius at it. After a short stint in the house,

129
00:07:18.501 --> 00:07:21.080
which included the successful prosecution of alga,

130
00:07:21.530 --> 00:07:25.580
his state department deployed on Soviet stooge. Nixon ran for the Senate.

131
00:07:25.670 --> 00:07:27.770
This time has campaigning was so negative.

132
00:07:27.771 --> 00:07:30.950
It's approached absolute zero Nixon slandered.

133
00:07:30.951 --> 00:07:33.730
His opponent does pink right down to our underwear.

134
00:07:34.100 --> 00:07:37.740
His staff handing out pink sheets, falsely comparing her voting records.

135
00:07:37.790 --> 00:07:40.970
A lot of communists as it did in 1946.

136
00:07:41.030 --> 00:07:43.730
It works and Nixon became Senator. However,

137
00:07:43.880 --> 00:07:47.260
he also picked up something else alongside his Senate seat, a ghosted,

138
00:07:47.261 --> 00:07:51.110
the negative campaign, the California press branded Nixon, tricky Dick.

139
00:07:51.620 --> 00:07:54.380
It was a nickname that would stick with him for life.

140
00:07:54.440 --> 00:07:59.300
But what did Dick mix and cab from a Bryant blue collar kid spurned by elite

141
00:07:59.301 --> 00:08:04.280
C had gone on to become a Washington insider and his meteoric rise was not

142
00:08:04.281 --> 00:08:06.980
going to stop that in 1952, Republican nominee,

143
00:08:07.010 --> 00:08:09.770
Dwight D Eisenhower picked tricky Dick to be his running mate,

144
00:08:09.771 --> 00:08:12.440
hoping that Nixon's California roots would win him the West.

145
00:08:12.680 --> 00:08:15.020
It was Nixon's ticket to the big leagues,

146
00:08:15.140 --> 00:08:18.410
but it was also nearly his undoing that sometime though the New York post

147
00:08:18.411 --> 00:08:18.801
splashed,

148
00:08:18.801 --> 00:08:22.790
a story of a secret Nixon slush fund using campaign donations to support his

149
00:08:22.791 --> 00:08:23.624
lifestyle,

150
00:08:23.690 --> 00:08:28.400
although untrue it nearly torpedoed Nixon's trances Eisenhower called in and

151
00:08:28.430 --> 00:08:31.610
basically said, looked it sought out there's massive balls up,

152
00:08:31.611 --> 00:08:35.720
or I'm going to find a new VP. Got it. And Nixon. Well,

153
00:08:35.930 --> 00:08:38.420
he got it on September the 23rd, 1952,

154
00:08:38.421 --> 00:08:40.790
Richard Nixon went on TV to explain himself.

155
00:08:40.970 --> 00:08:45.710
It was the first ever political speech televised live drawing a staggering 60

156
00:08:45.710 --> 00:08:50.210
million viewers before the old Nixon laid bare his finances in painful pitiful

157
00:08:50.211 --> 00:08:53.900
detail, painting a picture of a struggling relatable man.

158
00:08:54.130 --> 00:08:57.330
This beach was full of pathetic human touches, such as when Nixon confessed.

159
00:08:57.860 --> 00:08:59.270
<v 3>Pat doesn't have a mink coat,</v>

160
00:09:00.650 --> 00:09:04.010
but she does have a respectable Republican cloth coat.

161
00:09:04.730 --> 00:09:07.550
And I always tell her that she'd looked good in anything.

162
00:09:07.940 --> 00:09:11.780
<v 0>But what made the speech famous was when Nixon announced he had been given one</v>

163
00:09:11.781 --> 00:09:16.610
political gift, a Cocker spaniel named checkers that his children loved and.

164
00:09:17.480 --> 00:09:20.300
They were going to keep that dog known as the check his speech today,

165
00:09:20.301 --> 00:09:25.100
the live broadcast saved Nixon's career Eisenhower calls him up and declared

166
00:09:25.790 --> 00:09:27.740
yo, my boy, then November the fourth,

167
00:09:27.800 --> 00:09:30.920
the Eisenhower Nixon ticket won in a landslide.

168
00:09:31.190 --> 00:09:34.130
It now seems that Dick Nixon's rise was unstoppable.

169
00:09:41.060 --> 00:09:43.820
There's noise in our quote, that brilliantly sums up Nixon's time.

170
00:09:43.880 --> 00:09:48.350
As VP asked by a reporter, what policies his Veep had contributed Eisenhower.

171
00:09:48.710 --> 00:09:51.230
Riley replied. If you gave me a week, I might think of one,

172
00:09:51.290 --> 00:09:54.140
but while Nixon wasn't transforming the nation as VP,

173
00:09:54.350 --> 00:09:58.550
he was still working hard on his main project to make Richard Nixon look as much

174
00:09:58.580 --> 00:10:00.350
like a future president as possible.

175
00:10:00.530 --> 00:10:03.110
There's been doing stuff like going on a tour of Venezuela,

176
00:10:03.140 --> 00:10:06.950
where he won praise for Cooley dealing with an anti-American mob and then stuff

177
00:10:06.951 --> 00:10:10.550
like traveling to the USSR where he engaged premier Nikita Khrushchev in a

178
00:10:10.551 --> 00:10:14.510
spirited debate inside a model American kitchen in this quest Nixon was helped

179
00:10:14.511 --> 00:10:17.540
by Eisenhower's failing health starting in 1955,

180
00:10:17.541 --> 00:10:21.620
Eisenhower suffered a series of heart attacks that often left Nixon as defacto

181
00:10:21.650 --> 00:10:25.280
president. Despite worries, that had used as temporary role as a bully pulpit,

182
00:10:25.460 --> 00:10:28.370
Nixon won plaudits as a sober and sensible leader.

183
00:10:28.430 --> 00:10:32.420
So when Eisenhower's second term expired and it became time to pick the next

184
00:10:32.421 --> 00:10:36.370
Republican nominee, everyone was squarely behind Nixon. With his experience.

185
00:10:36.400 --> 00:10:37.060
Nixon hopes,

186
00:10:37.060 --> 00:10:41.510
the 1960 election would be a cakewalk continuing his unstoppable rise.

187
00:10:41.630 --> 00:10:42.291
Unfortunately,

188
00:10:42.291 --> 00:10:45.830
the blue collar boy was about to go slamming into the glass ceiling.

189
00:10:45.920 --> 00:10:49.820
You will know the tale of the 1960 election and how fresh faced vibrant.

190
00:10:49.850 --> 00:10:52.910
John Kennedy completely blew stuffy old Nixon out of the water,

191
00:10:53.000 --> 00:10:57.260
but while most people credit JFK's media analysis wise pick of Lyndon Johnson as

192
00:10:57.261 --> 00:10:59.600
his running mate for his victory, Nixon sores.

193
00:10:59.601 --> 00:11:01.940
Another way as the presidency slipped from his grasp.

194
00:11:01.941 --> 00:11:06.110
But Nixon became convinced that the true culprit wasn't Kennedy's charisma or

195
00:11:06.111 --> 00:11:08.810
even the recent recession, it was Kennedy's money.

196
00:11:09.020 --> 00:11:10.460
As far as Nixon was concerned,

197
00:11:10.490 --> 00:11:13.970
this was just another case of the elites screwing over the working class.

198
00:11:13.971 --> 00:11:15.290
By that November,

199
00:11:15.320 --> 00:11:19.430
he felt he didn't lose the presidency so much as have it stolen from him.

200
00:11:19.580 --> 00:11:23.900
It was the end of Nixon's rise and the start of his long fall,

201
00:11:24.110 --> 00:11:26.450
his career in tatters, Nixon returned to California.

202
00:11:26.720 --> 00:11:30.080
Their local Republicans convinced him to run for governor just two years after

203
00:11:30.081 --> 00:11:34.280
failing to become president Nixon lost California's gubernatorial race by a

204
00:11:34.281 --> 00:11:36.650
depressing margin in the wake of the defeat,

205
00:11:36.680 --> 00:11:40.880
Nixon called a press conference where he bitterly declared you won't have Nixon

206
00:11:40.881 --> 00:11:45.140
to kick around anymore because gentlemen, this is my last press conference.

207
00:11:45.230 --> 00:11:48.200
What followed was a period in the political wilderness and being the political

208
00:11:48.201 --> 00:11:48.890
wilderness.

209
00:11:48.890 --> 00:11:53.650
It was way more comfortable than the actual wilderness and saw Nixon rich for

210
00:11:53.651 --> 00:11:55.870
the first time from his law practice.

211
00:11:56.020 --> 00:11:59.410
It also saw the former political Streetfighter refashion himself as an elder

212
00:11:59.411 --> 00:12:02.770
statesman making measured observations on the Vietnam war. However,

213
00:12:02.771 --> 00:12:06.370
Nixon was still politically minded enough to campaign for Barry Goldwater at the

214
00:12:06.371 --> 00:12:07.720
1964 election.

215
00:12:07.810 --> 00:12:11.620
Although Goldwater lost Nixon support made him a darling of the Republican,

216
00:12:11.621 --> 00:12:15.670
right? It was almost like Nixon was courting conservatives, building himself,

217
00:12:15.671 --> 00:12:18.940
a power base in Casey ever decided to run for president. Again,

218
00:12:19.330 --> 00:12:23.680
it was a shrewd move as 1968 approach the Republican party began searching for

219
00:12:23.681 --> 00:12:24.910
its next standard. Bear up.

220
00:12:24.940 --> 00:12:28.390
The obvious choice was an electrifying rising staff in California,

221
00:12:28.540 --> 00:12:29.800
a former actor, Chris,

222
00:12:30.070 --> 00:12:33.400
and the future of the party that actor's name was Ronald Reagan.

223
00:12:33.401 --> 00:12:36.160
And he'd go on to transform the GOPs fortunes,

224
00:12:36.490 --> 00:12:41.470
but not in 1968 as Reagan's popularity grew and Nixon craps back out of

225
00:12:41.471 --> 00:12:42.250
the shadows.

226
00:12:42.250 --> 00:12:46.810
He began approaching prominent conservatives ensuring they lined up behind him.

227
00:12:47.050 --> 00:12:49.210
By the time Reagan's campaign really got underway,

228
00:12:49.211 --> 00:12:52.780
the nomination had already been sewn up that August, 1968,

229
00:12:52.781 --> 00:12:55.720
Nixon was unanimously declared Republican nominee by now,

230
00:12:55.750 --> 00:12:59.260
Democrats were in chaos. Lyndon B Johnson had refused run.

231
00:12:59.260 --> 00:13:01.510
The convention had seen riots in front runner.

232
00:13:01.511 --> 00:13:04.690
Bobby Kennedy had been assassinated against that kind of backdrop.

233
00:13:04.870 --> 00:13:08.170
What else could possibly happen on November the fifth, 1968,

234
00:13:08.171 --> 00:13:10.630
Richard Nixon swept to the electoral college to win.

235
00:13:10.631 --> 00:13:14.890
The presidency has popular vote share. 43% was one of the lowest in history.

236
00:13:15.100 --> 00:13:17.470
These in a way by third-party candidate, George Wallace,

237
00:13:17.740 --> 00:13:20.530
but when we're still a win against all odds,

238
00:13:20.590 --> 00:13:24.640
he had shown them had shown up those stuck elites, those Kennedys,

239
00:13:24.730 --> 00:13:28.600
those New York liberals and the next scenario had now begun and tricky.

240
00:13:28.601 --> 00:13:31.180
Dick was set and it would go down in history.

241
00:13:37.990 --> 00:13:38.160
<v 5>Normally.</v>

242
00:13:38.160 --> 00:13:41.910
<v 0>Presidential biographics. This would be the point to talk you through that.</v>

243
00:13:41.911 --> 00:13:45.120
I'm in office, hopefully with some jokes thrown in as well.

244
00:13:45.121 --> 00:13:48.180
But since this video is only about 26 minutes long,

245
00:13:48.181 --> 00:13:51.330
and we've still got a massive thing called Watergate to discuss,

246
00:13:51.331 --> 00:13:55.950
we're going to have to just give you the barest overview of the Nixon

247
00:13:56.010 --> 00:14:00.120
presidency. And that's a shame because there's so much to talk about.

248
00:14:00.300 --> 00:14:04.890
Take school busing. Although education had been desegregated under Eisenhower,

249
00:14:04.920 --> 00:14:08.430
geographic separation, most schools were still mano colored.

250
00:14:08.670 --> 00:14:10.560
One solution was school busing,

251
00:14:10.561 --> 00:14:13.260
which involved busing black children into white schools.

252
00:14:13.410 --> 00:14:14.970
Although Nixon was against the practice.

253
00:14:14.971 --> 00:14:18.270
The Supreme court ruling forced him to enforce it Dick's solution.

254
00:14:18.600 --> 00:14:20.670
Well that was new federalism at its heart.

255
00:14:20.880 --> 00:14:25.020
New federalism was desegregation but done by local communities rather than the

256
00:14:25.680 --> 00:14:28.380
government by racial communities were established across the South.

257
00:14:28.410 --> 00:14:32.580
Each charged with implementing desegregation rather than simply passing the

258
00:14:32.910 --> 00:14:36.510
buck. It's actually worked between Nixon's election in 1970,

259
00:14:36.511 --> 00:14:41.280
the number of black kids in racially segregated schools dropped from 70% to only

260
00:14:41.281 --> 00:14:45.150
18%. Then there's the environment. If you're below a certain age,

261
00:14:45.151 --> 00:14:49.650
the words Republican presidents plus environments probably come to images of

262
00:14:49.651 --> 00:14:54.620
guys in expensive suits, pouring gallons of oil on to baby seals,

263
00:14:54.800 --> 00:14:56.330
but not Nixon tricky.

264
00:14:56.331 --> 00:14:59.720
Dick was well aware that green issues were a vote winner among moderate

265
00:14:59.721 --> 00:15:01.760
Democrats. So he leaned into them.

266
00:15:01.970 --> 00:15:05.780
It was on Nixon's watch that the environmental protection agency was created and

267
00:15:05.781 --> 00:15:07.820
the clean air act passed. And other thing,

268
00:15:07.821 --> 00:15:10.130
Dick Nixon supported or women's rights.

269
00:15:10.340 --> 00:15:12.980
Well Nixon's environmentalism came mostly from cynical vote.

270
00:15:12.981 --> 00:15:16.280
Grabbing his desire for gender equality was mostly sincere.

271
00:15:16.340 --> 00:15:19.940
Nixon directed the federal government launched affirmative action on women's

272
00:15:19.941 --> 00:15:24.410
rights and pass legislation like title nine for bidding sex discrimination in

273
00:15:24.411 --> 00:15:26.930
education. Then there was war.

274
00:15:27.050 --> 00:15:30.620
It was Nixon who started both the war on cancer, the war on drugs,

275
00:15:30.740 --> 00:15:35.000
plus the actual war in Cambodia after he authorized us incursions.

276
00:15:35.090 --> 00:15:36.410
That last one, by the way,

277
00:15:36.530 --> 00:15:40.040
led to one of the most infamous non Watergate moments of his presidency.

278
00:15:40.250 --> 00:15:40.881
On may the fourth,

279
00:15:40.881 --> 00:15:45.380
1970 peaceful demonstrators gathered a Kent state there before hundreds of

280
00:15:45.381 --> 00:15:45.831
witnesses,

281
00:15:45.831 --> 00:15:50.750
the Ohio national guard shot down for unarmed people and injured another nine,

282
00:15:51.230 --> 00:15:52.400
despite massive public outcry,

283
00:15:52.401 --> 00:15:54.890
the Nixon white house didn't prosecute any guardsmen.

284
00:15:55.280 --> 00:15:59.810
The last major Nixon initiative we should talk about is China in February, 1972,

285
00:15:59.811 --> 00:16:03.680
Nixon surprised the world by going to visit the middle kingdom surprised because

286
00:16:03.681 --> 00:16:06.950
until that point, China had been America's bogeyman number two,

287
00:16:07.190 --> 00:16:08.690
all right behind the USSR.

288
00:16:08.870 --> 00:16:12.980
But Nixon realized he could keep the USSR in check by cozying up to Beijing.

289
00:16:13.220 --> 00:16:14.540
Although the move was cynical,

290
00:16:14.541 --> 00:16:18.500
it's now seen as the moment communist China started opening up to the world.

291
00:16:18.920 --> 00:16:20.630
So they have it four years of Nixon,

292
00:16:20.660 --> 00:16:25.490
four of the most dramatic years in modern us history condensed in to about 400

293
00:16:25.491 --> 00:16:26.324
words.

294
00:16:26.410 --> 00:16:30.620
We still had to leave so much out from the oil crisis to ending the draft to the

295
00:16:30.621 --> 00:16:34.430
Nixon shock that ended Bretton woods and set the stage for a decade of

296
00:16:34.431 --> 00:16:35.990
stagflation. Still,

297
00:16:36.080 --> 00:16:39.500
at least you're now aware that there was more to the Nixon presidency than

298
00:16:39.501 --> 00:16:43.850
merely scandal, especially as we move towards the biggest scandal of all,

299
00:16:44.060 --> 00:16:47.210
because it's finally time to talk about Watergate.

300
00:16:54.070 --> 00:16:54.130
<v 6>[Inaudible].</v>

301
00:16:54.130 --> 00:16:57.340
<v 0>There's one saying I'm a set it straight, this Watergate,</v>

302
00:16:57.430 --> 00:17:00.430
and that's exactly what I'm going to do for you right now.

303
00:17:00.431 --> 00:17:03.370
And wish me luck because it's super complicated.

304
00:17:03.490 --> 00:17:06.760
Although Nixon's first time was outwardly successful behind the scenes.

305
00:17:06.761 --> 00:17:10.420
Tricky Dick's paranoia was increasing in February of 1971,

306
00:17:10.421 --> 00:17:14.050
the 37th president installed a secret taping system in the white house.

307
00:17:14.051 --> 00:17:16.630
One activated the moment anyone entered the room,

308
00:17:16.660 --> 00:17:20.920
but the real crazy started on June the 13th, 1971. That was the day.

309
00:17:20.921 --> 00:17:23.140
The New York times published the Pentagon papers.

310
00:17:23.710 --> 00:17:25.930
Top-secret documents laying bare American atrocities.

311
00:17:25.931 --> 00:17:27.580
And in competence in Vietnam,

312
00:17:27.640 --> 00:17:30.250
while the papers stopped with Lyndon Johnson's white house,

313
00:17:30.280 --> 00:17:32.410
Nixon was still outraged to the league.

314
00:17:32.470 --> 00:17:35.620
It was from this outrage that the white house plumbers were formed.

315
00:17:35.830 --> 00:17:36.760
A top secret team.

316
00:17:36.761 --> 00:17:40.300
The plumbers were there to stop leaks through the use of spying sabotage and

317
00:17:40.750 --> 00:17:40.810
breaking.

318
00:17:40.810 --> 00:17:43.690
The first step was to break into the office of the shrink who treated the

319
00:17:43.691 --> 00:17:44.890
Pentagon papers leak up.

320
00:17:45.100 --> 00:17:48.190
It wouldn't be the last time the plumbers got involved in something shady.

321
00:17:48.370 --> 00:17:50.700
So let's fast now to 1972,

322
00:17:50.730 --> 00:17:54.450
Nixon is up for reelection and his most likely opponents is the formidable

323
00:17:54.451 --> 00:17:58.950
democratic Senator Edmund Muskie that spring a Basilica set of problems set

324
00:17:59.430 --> 00:18:03.270
musky white voters in early States were harassed by late night phone calls from

325
00:18:03.271 --> 00:18:06.090
rude people who claimed they were black supporters of Muskie.

326
00:18:06.330 --> 00:18:09.990
Others received letters on Muskie stationary that spewed absurd conspiracy

327
00:18:09.991 --> 00:18:11.760
theories about his primary opponents.

328
00:18:12.150 --> 00:18:15.690
And of course it was Nixon back to his old negative campaigning.

329
00:18:16.080 --> 00:18:19.740
Now he had to help from both the plumbers and to the campaign to reelect the

330
00:18:19.741 --> 00:18:24.300
president pleasingly abbreviated to creep and creep would stop at

331
00:18:24.301 --> 00:18:26.970
nothing to fulfill that mission by April,

332
00:18:26.971 --> 00:18:29.160
the precious that torpedoed muskies run,

333
00:18:29.161 --> 00:18:33.750
but the plumbers were still at it at 2:00 AM. On the 17th of June, 1972,

334
00:18:33.751 --> 00:18:37.080
they broke into the Democrat party headquarters in the Watergate office building

335
00:18:37.560 --> 00:18:40.860
intending to bug the place. Instead, they got caught by a security guard.

336
00:18:40.920 --> 00:18:41.701
Within two days,

337
00:18:41.701 --> 00:18:45.420
the Washington post was reporting that one of the burglars was a salaried member

338
00:18:45.421 --> 00:18:48.420
of creep, but Nixon assumed it would just blow over.

339
00:18:48.690 --> 00:18:52.920
He's actually on tape declaring the story will die and saying who the hell is

340
00:18:52.921 --> 00:18:54.180
going to keep it alive.

341
00:18:54.420 --> 00:18:59.010
The two name answer Bob Woodward and Carl Bernstein all through that hot summer.

342
00:18:59.011 --> 00:19:01.590
The post reporters published articles covering creeps,

343
00:19:01.591 --> 00:19:06.420
dirty tricks and linking a Nixon check for $28,000 to one of the Watergate

344
00:19:06.450 --> 00:19:10.140
burglars. But no one was paying any attention behind the scenes.

345
00:19:10.141 --> 00:19:14.520
Nixon was ordering the CIA to interfere with the FBI's Watergate investigation

346
00:19:14.550 --> 00:19:15.301
out in the open,

347
00:19:15.301 --> 00:19:18.720
the Democrats had nominated left-wing populous George McGovern as their

348
00:19:19.230 --> 00:19:21.300
candidate and Nixon was making mincemeat out of him.

349
00:19:21.360 --> 00:19:25.800
Despite the steady trickle of Watergate stories. Nixon crushed McGovern in 1972,

350
00:19:25.950 --> 00:19:29.190
winning one of the biggest landslides in us history. Seriously,

351
00:19:29.191 --> 00:19:32.790
the only comparable victories FDR in 36 and Reagan in 84.

352
00:19:32.820 --> 00:19:36.480
But while the voters had agreed to reinstate Dick into the white house for a

353
00:19:36.481 --> 00:19:37.171
second term,

354
00:19:37.171 --> 00:19:41.160
the wheels were already coming off the presidency just days before Nixon's

355
00:19:41.161 --> 00:19:45.630
inauguration. The seven men involved in Watergate break-in went on trial.

356
00:19:45.720 --> 00:19:48.930
Perhaps Nixon expected them to stay loyal to him. If so,

357
00:19:49.380 --> 00:19:51.960
his trust was misplaced over the next few months,

358
00:19:51.990 --> 00:19:56.220
these seven men would nearly all choose saving their own skins over saving

359
00:19:56.221 --> 00:20:00.960
Nixon. Tricky. Dick couldn't see it yet, but his presidency was already doomed.

360
00:20:07.190 --> 00:20:07.950
<v 7>Richard Nixon.</v>

361
00:20:07.950 --> 00:20:11.840
<v 0>Second time is a little like reading Shakespearian tragedy re-imagined as</v>

362
00:20:12.110 --> 00:20:15.350
depressing FOS, barely was Nixon back in the oval office.

363
00:20:15.380 --> 00:20:17.990
Then the walls started closing in on February the seventh,

364
00:20:17.991 --> 00:20:21.800
the Democrat controlled Senate passed resolution 60 establishing the Watergate

365
00:20:21.801 --> 00:20:24.530
hearings. Initially this didn't bother Nixon much.

366
00:20:24.590 --> 00:20:27.590
He went on TV to assure viewers that he was blameless,

367
00:20:27.770 --> 00:20:30.980
but the fullest lay with some rogue AIDS. Most people believed him,

368
00:20:31.040 --> 00:20:35.360
but then may rolled around and things started to unravel on the 18th special

369
00:20:35.361 --> 00:20:38.570
prosecutor. Archibald Cox was appointed shortly thereafter.

370
00:20:38.600 --> 00:20:41.390
The secret white house taping system was discovered. Not.

371
00:20:42.120 --> 00:20:45.650
<v 7>Cox was all like, ah, so you've been recording your conversations.</v>

372
00:20:45.650 --> 00:20:50.200
<v 0>This entire time. Well, if I have a listen to Richard, Nixon was like, uh,</v>

373
00:20:50.290 --> 00:20:54.190
no, you can't, but I'll tell you what's on the tape. Stop. Proving my innocence.

374
00:20:54.280 --> 00:20:57.100
Tiredly innocent as the climate grooves or release the tapes.

375
00:20:57.130 --> 00:20:59.710
Nixon's paranoia at reaching new Heights in his hands.

376
00:20:59.920 --> 00:21:04.240
It was everything had ever fed shadowy elite teaming up with a Jewish reporter,

377
00:21:04.440 --> 00:21:06.790
just screw over the poor blue collar.

378
00:21:06.820 --> 00:21:09.220
Dick Nixon convinced he had enemies everywhere.

379
00:21:09.221 --> 00:21:13.000
The 37th president lashed out in the most self-destructive way possible.

380
00:21:13.210 --> 00:21:15.160
The Saturday night massacre on October the 20th,

381
00:21:15.170 --> 00:21:19.930
1973 was a turning point in the scandal in quick succession, Nixon fads,

382
00:21:20.140 --> 00:21:23.320
both as attorney general and deputy attorney general for refusing to fire

383
00:21:23.350 --> 00:21:27.130
Archibald Cox before his solicitor general agreed to carry out the order.

384
00:21:27.370 --> 00:21:31.210
Half an hour later, Nixon ordered the FBI to seal it off Cox's his offices.

385
00:21:31.330 --> 00:21:33.790
It was supposed to kill the investigation through force,

386
00:21:33.820 --> 00:21:38.140
but instead it created outrage in the house. Impeachment charges were filed.

387
00:21:38.440 --> 00:21:40.810
Petly Republicans began to speak out against the president.

388
00:21:40.870 --> 00:21:45.280
Chastised Nixon was forced to hire a new special prosecutor, Leon Jaworski.

389
00:21:45.400 --> 00:21:48.610
By now it was clear that the presidents had something to hide.

390
00:21:48.910 --> 00:21:51.970
The rest of the story plays out with painful inevitability.

391
00:21:52.240 --> 00:21:57.130
There's the infamous. I'm not a crook speech in November, 1973, the March,

392
00:21:57.130 --> 00:21:59.950
1974 in diamonds of seven Nixon AIDS by a grand jury.

393
00:22:00.190 --> 00:22:01.750
As the subpoena for the white house tapes,

394
00:22:01.780 --> 00:22:05.320
the Supreme court battle that ruled against Nixon on July the 24th,

395
00:22:05.470 --> 00:22:09.280
forcing him to release them. After that, it was all over on August the fifth,

396
00:22:09.281 --> 00:22:12.160
1974, the first transcripts of the tapes appeared in the media.

397
00:22:12.190 --> 00:22:16.390
They included Nixon directing the CIA to interfere with the FBI's investigation.

398
00:22:16.510 --> 00:22:18.940
The president of this recording, the smoking gun.

399
00:22:19.030 --> 00:22:23.080
The strangest thing about Watergate in hindsight is that Nixon really didn't

400
00:22:23.110 --> 00:22:25.510
have anything to do with the break-in creep.

401
00:22:25.540 --> 00:22:29.560
And the plumbers really had gone rogue and Nixon could have probably weathered

402
00:22:29.561 --> 00:22:32.650
that smaller scandal instead he chose to cover it up.

403
00:22:32.950 --> 00:22:36.160
And that was a much bigger deal. Following the release of the transcripts.

404
00:22:36.190 --> 00:22:38.200
Congress moved to impeach Nixon.

405
00:22:38.440 --> 00:22:41.740
It's almost certain the votes with that remove him from office,

406
00:22:41.770 --> 00:22:45.580
but Nixon never gave them the chance on August the eighth of 1974,

407
00:22:45.581 --> 00:22:47.410
Richard Nixon announced his resignation,

408
00:22:47.620 --> 00:22:52.240
the only president in history to do so at noon the next day he and his family

409
00:22:52.241 --> 00:22:53.290
left by helicopter.

410
00:22:53.410 --> 00:22:57.850
As they departed Nixon turned grinned and flashed D V sign for victory.

411
00:22:58.120 --> 00:23:01.750
And so ended Dick Nixon's presidency less than a month later on September the

412
00:23:01.751 --> 00:23:05.110
eighth, the new president, Gerald Ford issued a blanket. Pardon? For any crimes,

413
00:23:05.111 --> 00:23:06.910
Richard Nixon may have committed while in office.

414
00:23:07.000 --> 00:23:10.900
It was a hugely unpopular move. And one that likely handed the Democrats,

415
00:23:10.901 --> 00:23:13.990
the white house in 1976, but there was nothing anyone could do.

416
00:23:14.320 --> 00:23:17.830
Dick Nixon was now Mandy would always be a free man.

417
00:23:17.980 --> 00:23:21.460
The only question now was what to do with all this unexpected,

418
00:23:28.480 --> 00:23:31.680
A huge amount to say about Nixon's life. After the white house, he ends passing,

419
00:23:31.890 --> 00:23:35.130
moved back to California, settled in San Clemente. At first,

420
00:23:35.131 --> 00:23:36.960
the disgrace president kept his head low,

421
00:23:36.961 --> 00:23:40.350
but legal fights that so sapped his bank accounts that he returned to public

422
00:23:40.351 --> 00:23:41.730
life just to get his money back.

423
00:23:41.760 --> 00:23:45.000
And so we got the unedifying spectacle of the frost Nixon,

424
00:23:45.470 --> 00:23:49.550
which earns Nixon $600,000 into the publication of his memoirs,

425
00:23:49.551 --> 00:23:51.140
which netted him 2 million yet,

426
00:23:51.141 --> 00:23:54.320
even though Nixon remained a hugely divisive figure with the public.

427
00:23:54.350 --> 00:23:58.130
Those on Capitol Hill could never quite let go of him across the next 15 years.

428
00:23:58.131 --> 00:23:59.120
Presidents, Jimmy Carter,

429
00:23:59.121 --> 00:24:02.600
Ronald Reagan and George H w Bush all came to consult with tricky.

430
00:24:02.601 --> 00:24:06.350
Dick searching out his experience in foreign policy by 1990,

431
00:24:06.351 --> 00:24:09.740
the image of Nixon as an elder statesmen had so ended the political class,

432
00:24:09.741 --> 00:24:13.460
that three ex presidents came to the opening of his library in a weird way.

433
00:24:13.520 --> 00:24:16.100
This was everything Nixon had ever dreamed of here.

434
00:24:16.101 --> 00:24:19.760
He was a man who had committed high crimes and misdemeanors yet had not only

435
00:24:19.761 --> 00:24:22.340
never faced justice, but was now being publicly on it.

436
00:24:22.400 --> 00:24:26.420
Does that sound like a blue collar kid from the sticks or like a member of the

437
00:24:26.421 --> 00:24:30.350
privileged elite? Richard Nixon finally died on April the 22nd,

438
00:24:30.351 --> 00:24:32.840
1994 at his funeral president bill Clinton,

439
00:24:32.960 --> 00:24:36.590
and gave a stirring eulogy that ended with the words may the day of judging

440
00:24:36.591 --> 00:24:41.570
president Nixon on anything less than his entire life and Korea come to a close.

441
00:24:41.720 --> 00:24:45.320
The political rehabilitation of Richard Nixon was now so total that Watergate

442
00:24:45.321 --> 00:24:49.700
was seemingly forgotten. But the story doesn't end that today,

443
00:24:49.701 --> 00:24:52.280
the Watergate scandal is older than me for starters,

444
00:24:52.310 --> 00:24:54.110
but major stuff like star Wars,

445
00:24:54.111 --> 00:24:57.230
the Iranian revolution and the entire countries of Angola.

446
00:24:57.440 --> 00:25:01.040
So Lakia or Mozambique in shorts, it's history,

447
00:25:01.070 --> 00:25:03.920
something that happened in the dim and distant past yet.

448
00:25:03.920 --> 00:25:08.750
Somehow we still remember it in a world where even major political scandals like

449
00:25:08.751 --> 00:25:12.350
Iran contrary, or the Pentagon papers have slipped from the public's mind.

450
00:25:12.740 --> 00:25:15.110
That's really saying something for whatever reason.

451
00:25:15.140 --> 00:25:17.480
Watergate has become only more notorious.

452
00:25:17.481 --> 00:25:20.270
It's now the gold standard of scandal.

453
00:25:20.420 --> 00:25:23.000
No matter how hard the political class may have tried,

454
00:25:23.390 --> 00:25:25.160
it would always stain Nixon's name.

455
00:25:25.370 --> 00:25:29.330
And yet there is no denying that there was more to the 37th president than a

456
00:25:29.331 --> 00:25:33.260
single scandal. Richard Nixon was a complex, flawed and brilliant man.

457
00:25:33.320 --> 00:25:34.940
He was insecure and bullying,

458
00:25:34.941 --> 00:25:37.910
but also a man who understood the pain of being an outsider,

459
00:25:37.970 --> 00:25:41.300
an ordinary man who really thought he could change his country for the better

460
00:25:41.570 --> 00:25:45.020
too often in history and politics. We'd like to paint simple narratives.

461
00:25:45.080 --> 00:25:48.920
This man is a monster. This man is a Saint blah, blah, blah.

462
00:25:48.980 --> 00:25:52.310
But real life is necessarily simple. And as men like Nixon,

463
00:25:52.460 --> 00:25:56.900
I never simply caricatures cartoon villains that to be laughed at they're human

464
00:25:56.901 --> 00:26:01.580
beings, really heart really care, and sometimes even managed to do some good.

465
00:26:01.880 --> 00:26:03.740
Richard Nixon may be long gone now,

466
00:26:03.770 --> 00:26:07.220
but the lessons we learned from his presidency should stay with us forever.

467
00:26:07.460 --> 00:26:12.290
It's easy to hate such a man, but it takes real guts to try to understand him.

468
