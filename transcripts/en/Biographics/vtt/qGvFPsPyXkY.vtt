You're also going to find a link in their description below

00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:24.070
Felic or Augusto Meor trio. According to fourth century historian utopias,

7
00:00:24.100 --> 00:00:27.790
that was the acclimation used to greet to new Roman emperors. In his time.

8
00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:32.270
It expressed hope that the ruler would be more fortunate than Augustus and

9
00:00:32.271 --> 00:00:35.750
better than Trajan. The historian lived 200 years after tradein,

10
00:00:35.751 --> 00:00:39.230
but the memory of his reign of prosperity was still very much alive in the

11
00:00:39.330 --> 00:00:43.980
hearts and the minds of the Roman people Trajan was part of the five good

12
00:00:44.260 --> 00:00:44.690
emperors,

13
00:00:44.690 --> 00:00:49.300
five successive rulers who presided over an 85 year period of affluence for the

14
00:00:49.301 --> 00:00:51.060
Roman em empire of those emperors.

15
00:00:51.240 --> 00:00:54.220
We can safely say that Trajan was the best of the bunch.

16
00:00:54.440 --> 00:00:57.100
He enacted welfare policies for the poor restored,

17
00:00:57.101 --> 00:01:01.340
confiscated properties and undertook numerous construction projects within

18
00:01:01.560 --> 00:01:05.450
borders. He brought stability while outwardly he led military campaigns,

19
00:01:05.451 --> 00:01:09.290
which saw the Roman empire expand to its greatest size ever.

20
00:01:09.470 --> 00:01:13.450
He became the Paragon that all subsequent emperors aspired to emulate.

21
00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:17.130
Although none of them reached the same Heights to honor his accomplishments.

22
00:01:17.131 --> 00:01:21.090
The Roman center bestowed upon Trajan the title of optimist print caps.

23
00:01:21.350 --> 00:01:22.183
The best route

24
00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:29.540
Trajan was born.

25
00:01:29.540 --> 00:01:34.400
Marcus ops tri on September the 18th 53 CE in

26
00:01:34.401 --> 00:01:35.840
the city of Atica.

27
00:01:35.870 --> 00:01:39.560
This was located Inia beta car Roman province,

28
00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:43.550
which roughly corresponds to the modern region of, and the Lou in Spain.

29
00:01:44.740 --> 00:01:49.230
This is in of itself significant because Trajan will become the first Roman

30
00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:54.030
emperor to be born outside of Italy. His father was Marcus Pius, tri the elder,

31
00:01:54.350 --> 00:01:56.470
a Roman statesman while his mother was Marcia,

32
00:01:56.550 --> 00:01:59.350
a noble woman who was the sister-in-law of emperor TIS.

33
00:01:59.410 --> 00:02:04.100
He also had an older sister named Opia MAANA who remained very close to her

34
00:02:04.101 --> 00:02:05.180
brother throughout her life.

35
00:02:05.900 --> 00:02:09.980
Trajan would often consult her as Emper when making important decisions sometime

36
00:02:09.981 --> 00:02:10.701
during his reign,

37
00:02:10.701 --> 00:02:15.620
he bestowed upon Opia the Imperial title of Augusta making her the first sister

38
00:02:15.680 --> 00:02:17.460
of a Roman ruler to receive this honor.

39
00:02:18.180 --> 00:02:22.980
Trajan extended this love and trust Toya's daughter sallon EDIA as

40
00:02:23.260 --> 00:02:25.890
he him I've never had any children after PI's death.

41
00:02:26.330 --> 00:02:30.730
Trajan had her day of agents gave the title of Augusta to his niece as a young

42
00:02:30.750 --> 00:02:33.330
man Trajan distinguished himself with his military service.

43
00:02:33.550 --> 00:02:35.130
He quickly rose through the ranks.

44
00:02:35.131 --> 00:02:39.090
Undoubtedly helped by his father's position and influence sometime around the

45
00:02:39.210 --> 00:02:40.043
year 86,

46
00:02:40.130 --> 00:02:45.040
CE his cousin PLIs alias Hadis AER died and became one of

47
00:02:45.041 --> 00:02:48.640
the guardians of his two children, his daughter, Alia Dedia Paulina,

48
00:02:48.740 --> 00:02:51.480
and his son Publius alias HES. The younger,

49
00:02:51.820 --> 00:02:56.600
the son would later succeed TRN to the throne of Romes emperor. He also,

50
00:02:56.601 --> 00:02:58.320
during this period, he met and married.

51
00:02:58.590 --> 00:03:03.040
Poer the Tina ancient scholars portrayed her as being a kind and intelligent

52
00:03:03.041 --> 00:03:03.500
woman.

53
00:03:03.500 --> 00:03:07.200
She took an active role during our husband's reign sponsoring initiatives to

54
00:03:07.201 --> 00:03:11.000
help the poor and improve education. She outlived Trajan by a few years.

55
00:03:11.100 --> 00:03:15.320
And when she passed on Adrian built her a temple and dare fighter Trajan's

56
00:03:15.480 --> 00:03:16.840
military life is poorly documented.

57
00:03:16.940 --> 00:03:20.190
We know that he was successful in and well liked by his fellow soldiers.

58
00:03:20.191 --> 00:03:23.430
Something that would prove vital to his ascent of power later on,

59
00:03:23.570 --> 00:03:27.910
he served as a tribute for 10 years or so and traveled to Syria when his father

60
00:03:27.911 --> 00:03:32.070
became governor that in 89, CE Trajan was in command of his own Legion.

61
00:03:32.071 --> 00:03:36.110
And he was sent to either Hasia or upper Germania to put down a co against

62
00:03:36.390 --> 00:03:37.110
emperor.

63
00:03:37.110 --> 00:03:41.180
Dominium discerns him the favor of the ruler who granted Trajan a consul ship in

64
00:03:41.181 --> 00:03:42.014
91

65
00:03:47.800 --> 00:03:51.060
In order to get a proper understanding of Trajan's rise to the throne.

66
00:03:51.160 --> 00:03:54.300
We need a little backgrounds on the two emperors who came before him.

67
00:03:54.360 --> 00:03:58.860
The affor mentioned de median a nerve de median ended up being the last ruler of

68
00:03:58.861 --> 00:04:02.690
the Flavian dynasty and ancient sources would have us believe that he was a

69
00:04:02.691 --> 00:04:07.490
cruel ruthless and egomaniacal tyrant. Modern historians tend to disagree,

70
00:04:07.491 --> 00:04:11.490
however, and discern that these characterizations of the emperor were part of a

71
00:04:11.491 --> 00:04:14.530
concentrated effort to denigrate him after his death.

72
00:04:14.850 --> 00:04:18.770
It was almost certain that Domitian was an autocrat who ruled with an iron fist

73
00:04:19.090 --> 00:04:21.800
and instituted a of personality around himself.

74
00:04:21.900 --> 00:04:26.280
But his totalitarian tendencies were usually focused on one particular group.

75
00:04:26.540 --> 00:04:28.640
The aristocracy of Rome, specifically,

76
00:04:28.641 --> 00:04:32.520
he was constantly at odds with the Senate who powers the emperor tailed.

77
00:04:32.620 --> 00:04:36.240
His policies in propaganda actually made the emperor pretty popular with the

78
00:04:36.241 --> 00:04:41.190
people and the army Tait was assassinated on September the 18th, 19 C.

79
00:04:41.191 --> 00:04:45.590
According to Stuart, he became an object of terror and hatred to all,

80
00:04:45.690 --> 00:04:49.750
and was the target of a conspiracy organized by his own friends and favorite

81
00:04:50.230 --> 00:04:50.490
freed men.

82
00:04:50.490 --> 00:04:54.390
The emperor was slain in his chambers where he was stabbed seven times

83
00:05:01.300 --> 00:05:02.940
Ever was crowns. The new ruler of Roman.

84
00:05:03.040 --> 00:05:06.700
He immediately began restoring many of the liberties and privileges that had

85
00:05:06.701 --> 00:05:08.500
been taken away by his predecessor.

86
00:05:08.940 --> 00:05:12.940
Neva was the first of the so-called five good emperors. And as you would expect,

87
00:05:12.941 --> 00:05:16.580
he did many things to earn this reputation. He brought people back from exile.

88
00:05:16.581 --> 00:05:20.100
He put a Holtz to trees and trials and gave a lot of land to the poor.

89
00:05:20.200 --> 00:05:23.970
He also instituted new policies to save money such as abolishing,

90
00:05:23.971 --> 00:05:28.490
many sacrifices and spectacles selling large golden silver statues commissioned

91
00:05:28.491 --> 00:05:33.130
by Domitian and forbidding that any such sculptures should be made in his own on

92
00:05:33.290 --> 00:05:35.930
app. Although Nova was popular with the people and the Senate,

93
00:05:36.150 --> 00:05:39.690
he failed to appease the army where support for Domitian was still strong.

94
00:05:39.790 --> 00:05:43.440
The Pretorian guard demanded that the conspirator to assassinated the previous

95
00:05:43.760 --> 00:05:46.080
emperor be executed, but never refused.

96
00:05:46.500 --> 00:05:49.960
Now let's have a quick side note to give a little historical context on how

97
00:05:49.961 --> 00:05:54.320
important it was for an emperor to have the approval of the Pretorian guard.

98
00:05:54.760 --> 00:05:56.960
Although they began as an elite military unit,

99
00:05:57.150 --> 00:06:01.040
they became the emperor's personal body yards under Augustus. From there,

100
00:06:01.041 --> 00:06:05.200
they kept growing in size and influence until they turned into the defacto

101
00:06:05.201 --> 00:06:06.360
police force of Rome.

102
00:06:06.490 --> 00:06:10.360
There have been quite a few intrigues and assassinations where the guards played

103
00:06:10.480 --> 00:06:14.520
a vital role. And maybe we'll talk about a few of those in future videos.

104
00:06:14.521 --> 00:06:18.230
Let us know if you're interested in that in the comments below on one

105
00:06:18.231 --> 00:06:19.630
particularly egregious occasion,

106
00:06:19.730 --> 00:06:23.670
the Pretorian guard killed the emperor and then effectively sold the throne of

107
00:06:23.671 --> 00:06:26.310
Rome by grounding their support to the highest bidder.

108
00:06:26.460 --> 00:06:29.790
This happens in 193 CE when they killed pattern,

109
00:06:29.791 --> 00:06:34.590
accent accepted an offer of 25,000 sess each to make DIDs

110
00:06:35.270 --> 00:06:36.550
GIS. The new emperor of Rome,

111
00:06:37.160 --> 00:06:41.820
his rain lasted a whopping 66 days before he was also assassinated.

112
00:06:42.120 --> 00:06:43.260
So back to never.

113
00:06:43.540 --> 00:06:47.820
And there was a problem with his reign and that was that he was old and in poor

114
00:06:47.821 --> 00:06:48.280
health,

115
00:06:48.280 --> 00:06:51.980
he was 66 years old when he took the throne and he had no children or close

116
00:06:52.180 --> 00:06:56.060
relatives, the discontents of the army, plus the lack of a clear successor,

117
00:06:56.061 --> 00:07:00.650
pretty much guaranteed civil war upon his death in an attempt to pacify the

118
00:07:00.651 --> 00:07:01.131
soldiers,

119
00:07:01.131 --> 00:07:05.810
never assigned commands of the Pretorian guard to Caspar aliens who

120
00:07:06.210 --> 00:07:08.530
served as a Pretorian prefect under the mission.

121
00:07:08.880 --> 00:07:11.490
This tactic backfired cuz aliens,

122
00:07:11.520 --> 00:07:16.410
incited the men to get justice for their former Ember in July or August 97,

123
00:07:16.770 --> 00:07:19.520
CE the Pretorian guard lay. He SED the Imperial palace,

124
00:07:19.670 --> 00:07:23.720
took the men responsible for Dominion's death by force and executed them.

125
00:07:23.721 --> 00:07:27.360
Another was not harmed, but his authority was in taters.

126
00:07:27.510 --> 00:07:29.720
Only one thing could help him keep his position,

127
00:07:29.820 --> 00:07:34.120
naming an air who was popular with the people, the army and the Senate.

128
00:07:34.580 --> 00:07:37.000
And that air was Trajan. Now,

129
00:07:37.001 --> 00:07:39.350
just before we get into Trajan's run is to the throne.

130
00:07:39.590 --> 00:07:43.430
I want to take a moment to tell you about today's sponsor brilliance engineering

131
00:07:43.431 --> 00:07:44.870
works like Trajan's bridge,

132
00:07:44.871 --> 00:07:48.510
which we're going to be getting into in just a moment were all possible because

133
00:07:48.610 --> 00:07:52.470
of a fundamental understanding of science and engineering,

134
00:07:52.471 --> 00:07:54.870
brilliant belief that learning science and math,

135
00:07:54.890 --> 00:07:57.430
it doesn't have to be darling to that.

136
00:07:57.590 --> 00:08:00.180
And they've put together courses that are all about storytelling,

137
00:08:00.450 --> 00:08:04.900
interactive challenges and solving problems. It's this hands on approach.

138
00:08:04.920 --> 00:08:06.820
That's a really excellent way to learn.

139
00:08:07.120 --> 00:08:10.180
And currently they have over 50 interactive courses.

140
00:08:10.520 --> 00:08:12.780
And look here you are halfway through an educational video,

141
00:08:12.920 --> 00:08:16.660
so you're probably already the curious type and brilliant can be a great way to

142
00:08:16.661 --> 00:08:21.610
just take that curiosity a step further and understand the world even

143
00:08:21.611 --> 00:08:22.444
more. For example,

144
00:08:22.470 --> 00:08:25.690
you could track out their course on geometry fundamentals where you'll learn

145
00:08:25.691 --> 00:08:30.570
things like angle axioms, 3d, geometry, coordinates, and a great deal. More.

146
00:08:30.680 --> 00:08:33.810
It's a great intro to how geometry is used in the real world.

147
00:08:33.830 --> 00:08:36.490
So effective learning. It's all about problem solving and brilliant.

148
00:08:36.680 --> 00:08:39.090
They help you learn and practice just that.

149
00:08:39.091 --> 00:08:41.080
It's a great compliment of videos like this. I mean,

150
00:08:41.081 --> 00:08:42.320
it's all good to learn something here,

151
00:08:42.321 --> 00:08:46.360
but take that learning a step further with brilliance so you can support

And let's get back to Trajan

156
00:09:06.720 --> 00:09:11.200
Trajan's appointment came just in time. He was named err in October of 97,

157
00:09:11.720 --> 00:09:13.160
CE a few months later on January,

158
00:09:13.220 --> 00:09:18.030
the 27th never died of natural causes after 15 months as emperor Trajan who

159
00:09:18.031 --> 00:09:22.390
was governor of Germania inferior when he heard the news was in no hurry to get

160
00:09:22.391 --> 00:09:23.830
to Rome to start his new career.

161
00:09:24.060 --> 00:09:28.470
Instead taking a lengthy tour of the Empire's frontiers scholars have suggested

162
00:09:28.471 --> 00:09:31.950
he did this in order to ensure that he had the loyalty of the soldiers across

163
00:09:31.951 --> 00:09:34.870
the Roman and domain, he did see fit to deal with a Pretorian.

164
00:09:35.220 --> 00:09:36.740
He revolted against nerve though.

165
00:09:36.880 --> 00:09:41.020
He sent for early ons and the rest of the muan ears to come to Germany for a

166
00:09:41.021 --> 00:09:44.300
special employment there. And according to CAS Dio,

167
00:09:44.560 --> 00:09:48.380
he puts them out of the way. It wasn't until the summer of 99,

168
00:09:48.740 --> 00:09:51.300
CE the Trajan finally set foot in Rome's emperor.

169
00:09:51.780 --> 00:09:54.820
Dio takes the opportunity here to compliments Platina Trajan's wife,

170
00:09:54.821 --> 00:09:57.130
who upon the entering the palaces for the first time,

171
00:09:57.131 --> 00:09:58.690
turned around to the crowd and said,

172
00:09:59.050 --> 00:10:03.450
I enter here such a woman as I would thing be when I depart and indeed,

173
00:10:03.451 --> 00:10:04.770
according to the historian,

174
00:10:04.771 --> 00:10:08.610
she exhibited behavior beyond reproach during the entire reign

175
00:10:14.910 --> 00:10:19.080
As emperor tri first turned his attention to DEHA a kingdom that mostly

176
00:10:19.230 --> 00:10:24.000
corresponds to modern day Romania ins mul over DEHA had been in Newin Rome

177
00:10:24.100 --> 00:10:27.200
on and off a few centuries during the mid first century BC,

178
00:10:27.360 --> 00:10:32.080
a powerful Dayan king called Bura Bea had United all the various tribes under

179
00:10:32.100 --> 00:10:34.720
his rule. Caesar was planning to lead a campaign there,

180
00:10:34.721 --> 00:10:37.030
but was killed in 44 BCE. However,

181
00:10:37.470 --> 00:10:41.070
bur Stewart was assassinated that same year and the kingdom slowly splintered

182
00:10:41.071 --> 00:10:43.750
after his death. It wasn't until over a century later,

183
00:10:43.751 --> 00:10:47.550
they reemerged as a MENA under king Duris and attacked.

184
00:10:47.551 --> 00:10:50.870
The Roman province of MOIC Dian was emperor.

185
00:10:50.871 --> 00:10:52.870
At the time he had to respond to this invasion.

186
00:10:53.010 --> 00:10:56.470
So he launched the first Dian war in 87 sea,

187
00:10:56.590 --> 00:10:58.100
a Roman army led by general,

188
00:10:58.130 --> 00:11:02.740
Cornelius fucus crossed the Dan new and suffered a humiliating loss at

189
00:11:03.220 --> 00:11:06.140
Tai. The next year, the renew defensive was more successful,

190
00:11:06.141 --> 00:11:10.340
but Domitian still had to accept peace on favorable terms to the dations because

191
00:11:10.440 --> 00:11:13.300
his army was needed someplace else to put down a rebellion.

192
00:11:13.560 --> 00:11:17.460
But the new Dian king Des balls might have declared himself a client of RO,

193
00:11:17.830 --> 00:11:20.890
but in exchange, he received money and craftsman,

194
00:11:20.891 --> 00:11:24.970
which he used to improve DA's defenses and Armitt soldiers for decades.

195
00:11:25.120 --> 00:11:28.050
This piece was a bit of an embarrassment for the mighty Roman em empire,

196
00:11:28.060 --> 00:11:32.290
especially since the Daan still like to carry on border raids from time to time,

197
00:11:32.970 --> 00:11:37.170
Cassio S D described debars as a worthy antagonist of the Romans,

198
00:11:37.450 --> 00:11:42.120
a king who Shrew in his understanding of warfare and a master in pitched

199
00:11:42.190 --> 00:11:42.790
battles.

200
00:11:42.790 --> 00:11:47.520
Clearly Trajan agreed because he saw it necessary to deal with a threat once and

201
00:11:47.521 --> 00:11:51.800
for all and restore some of the glory lost during DEIT failed campaign.

202
00:11:52.720 --> 00:11:56.960
Trajan got the Senate's blessing to go to war and in 101 CE the Roman army

203
00:11:56.990 --> 00:12:01.680
crossed the de river once again and invaded DEHA the Roman emperor.

204
00:12:01.681 --> 00:12:05.280
It obtained a major victory over Debar at the second battle of tope,

205
00:12:05.520 --> 00:12:07.120
a few more minor conflicts followed,

206
00:12:07.140 --> 00:12:10.600
but in the ends Trajan decided to Sue for peace because he didn't want his army

207
00:12:10.660 --> 00:12:13.670
to get caught in DEHA during winds this time, though,

208
00:12:13.770 --> 00:12:18.110
the terms were considerably in Rome's favor among other concessions,

209
00:12:18.170 --> 00:12:20.830
the days had to build a stone bridge over the Daniel,

210
00:12:20.840 --> 00:12:23.870
which would make it a lot easier for Roman troops to cross the river.

211
00:12:23.870 --> 00:12:25.590
Should they invade Daysha again,

212
00:12:26.070 --> 00:12:29.710
this structure simply known as Trajan's bridge was considered quite a Marvel of

213
00:12:29.711 --> 00:12:30.210
its time.

214
00:12:30.210 --> 00:12:34.580
It was designed by a brilliant Greek architect called lados of Damascus,

215
00:12:34.581 --> 00:12:38.300
who would also be responsible for other constructions ordered by Trajan.

216
00:12:38.360 --> 00:12:42.780
The bridge only stayed functional for a few decades until emperor ore destroyed

217
00:12:42.781 --> 00:12:47.740
it, but it remains the longest bridge of its kind for over a thousand years,

218
00:12:48.110 --> 00:12:48.943
there was peace,

219
00:12:49.000 --> 00:12:53.220
but Trajan understood that it was only a moment of respite until

220
00:12:54.070 --> 00:12:57.890
regain their strength and 105 CE the two sides went to war. Again.

221
00:12:57.920 --> 00:13:00.610
This time the fighting was more neck, neck.

222
00:13:00.611 --> 00:13:04.930
As the Roman struggled to gain a decisive victory in 106, they laid siege,

223
00:13:04.931 --> 00:13:05.764
the Dian capital,

224
00:13:05.830 --> 00:13:09.490
and eventually forced the people inside to surrender by destroying their water

225
00:13:09.550 --> 00:13:10.530
supply. Afterwards,

226
00:13:10.590 --> 00:13:14.440
the capital was raised to the ground Des Baras committed sewer aside,

227
00:13:14.680 --> 00:13:18.120
and instead of being taken prisoner and his head was brought back to Rome,

228
00:13:18.590 --> 00:13:22.480
half of DEHA was annexed as a Roman province while the other half remained free,

229
00:13:22.481 --> 00:13:27.040
but consisted of tribes that never United again, the lands had rich goldmines,

230
00:13:27.041 --> 00:13:29.040
which provided great boost to the Roman economy.

231
00:13:29.220 --> 00:13:33.240
Not to mention the tens of thousands of slaves who were sent back to Rome.

232
00:13:33.600 --> 00:13:34.433
A few years later,

233
00:13:34.870 --> 00:13:38.750
agents victory in the nation war was commemorated with a monuments called Trajan

234
00:13:38.751 --> 00:13:41.030
column, which still stands today in Rome.

235
00:13:41.290 --> 00:13:45.630
It is 115 feet tall and has a spiral bass relief,

236
00:13:45.631 --> 00:13:48.630
which depicts all the important events from the wars.

237
00:13:48.930 --> 00:13:52.510
It is actually the only source we have for some aspects of the conflict and

238
00:13:52.511 --> 00:13:53.830
historians still debate.

239
00:13:54.010 --> 00:13:58.940
If it is histor accurate or intended more as a propaganda piece inspired by

240
00:13:59.500 --> 00:14:00.780
commentary Deb BEO Gallo,

241
00:14:00.840 --> 00:14:04.980
Julius Caesar's firsthand account of his wars with the goals Trajan wrote Deb

242
00:14:05.260 --> 00:14:08.820
bellaco deco. Unfortunately the book is lost to history except for one sentence,

243
00:14:08.821 --> 00:14:10.660
which is quoted in a different work.

244
00:14:10.960 --> 00:14:14.860
The sentence means we advanced to bur ABUS and then to a

245
00:14:21.360 --> 00:14:22.610
Shortly after his triumph,

246
00:14:22.670 --> 00:14:26.250
Trajan had an opportunity to add the Naty and kingdom to his empire.

247
00:14:26.400 --> 00:14:29.410
This was significantly different from the fights he had with the nations.

248
00:14:29.550 --> 00:14:33.730
It was already a client state of Romans after king Rabel thei soda died in

249
00:14:33.731 --> 00:14:37.840
106. All it took was to move legions from nearby provinces.

250
00:14:38.060 --> 00:14:40.000
We don't know specifics about the conquest,

251
00:14:40.001 --> 00:14:42.880
but it seems that the troops encountered almost no resistance,

252
00:14:43.320 --> 00:14:45.280
less than ATA kingdom came to an end,

253
00:14:45.560 --> 00:14:48.720
as it was turned into a Roman province called Arabia pet.

254
00:14:49.180 --> 00:14:53.400
The next few years of Trajan's reign were peaceful and they allowed the to focus

255
00:14:53.420 --> 00:14:55.360
his attention on improving things back home.

256
00:14:55.380 --> 00:15:00.120
He had 123 days of games and festivities to celebrate his victory in the

257
00:15:00.400 --> 00:15:00.900
Dian wars.

258
00:15:00.900 --> 00:15:04.960
He built and improved roads and bridges such as the 205 Mar via Triano,

259
00:15:04.970 --> 00:15:07.800
which can still be found partially today in Rome,

260
00:15:08.000 --> 00:15:10.400
he put apple auras of damascus's talents to good.

261
00:15:10.770 --> 00:15:14.590
The architect designed and constructed a new market baths and a forum,

262
00:15:14.591 --> 00:15:18.470
which would become the last of the Imperial for built in ancient Rome.

263
00:15:18.570 --> 00:15:22.350
The only improvements they could have used was a bit more creativity with the

264
00:15:22.351 --> 00:15:24.710
names predictably. They were called Trajan's market.

265
00:15:25.050 --> 00:15:29.150
The Barss of Trajan and trades forum are the constructions ordered by the

266
00:15:29.270 --> 00:15:31.780
emperor included libraries, aqui temples,

267
00:15:31.800 --> 00:15:36.180
and a renovation of the circus Maximus, which saw it rebuilt entirely in stone.

268
00:15:36.370 --> 00:15:40.380
Cassius S D mentions in passing that Trajan was the target of several plots

269
00:15:40.381 --> 00:15:43.460
against him. He only names one conspirator as crass.

270
00:15:43.530 --> 00:15:47.540
Obviously these conspiracies fails and the emperor brought CRAs before the

271
00:15:47.541 --> 00:15:48.580
senates to be punished.

272
00:15:48.610 --> 00:15:52.490
What exactly happens to him in his co-conspirators remain a mystery as the

273
00:15:52.491 --> 00:15:56.490
historian specifies that Trajan made an oath not to shed blood by which he meant

274
00:15:56.770 --> 00:15:59.570
Roman blood, of course, and that he kept this vow

275
00:16:05.830 --> 00:16:10.010
In 113 CE Trajan ended a conflict with the Pathan empire,

276
00:16:10.210 --> 00:16:12.480
a powerful entity located in ancient Iran.

277
00:16:12.710 --> 00:16:17.400
Like DEHA Paia had been a thorn in room side as Cass between the two

278
00:16:17.430 --> 00:16:20.080
domains went back centuries. Also like DEHA,

279
00:16:20.140 --> 00:16:24.160
Trajan sought to be the one to solve this problem permanently and enjoy the

280
00:16:24.161 --> 00:16:27.040
renowned and acclamations that would come with it. In fact,

281
00:16:27.041 --> 00:16:30.520
the emperor's complete true motives remained somewhat of a hot topic among Roman

282
00:16:30.530 --> 00:16:33.110
historians. Some see as being practical,

283
00:16:33.590 --> 00:16:36.950
Trajan wanted to strengthen the defenses of his Eastern frontier and benefits

284
00:16:36.951 --> 00:16:39.910
from the economic boost of adding path here to the Roman empire.

285
00:16:39.930 --> 00:16:41.830
Others believe it was simply in his nature.

286
00:16:42.510 --> 00:16:44.310
Trajan was a military man first and foremost,

287
00:16:44.450 --> 00:16:47.430
and would've likely gone on waring as long as he could.

288
00:16:47.450 --> 00:16:52.070
And some pine that Tren wanted to emulate the conquest Alexander the great and

289
00:16:52.071 --> 00:16:55.820
secure for himself, the near divine status that the latter enjoyed,

290
00:16:56.380 --> 00:17:00.220
whatever the reason in 113, CE Trajan marched leaving Rome.

291
00:17:00.520 --> 00:17:04.820
And he would never return located between the two empires was the kingdom of

292
00:17:04.850 --> 00:17:06.980
Armenia. Although technically independent,

293
00:17:06.981 --> 00:17:11.700
it fell under the Heman of both Rome and Paia and both powers had a vested

294
00:17:11.980 --> 00:17:16.770
interest in ensuring that the ruler of Armenia was on their side in 110 CE

295
00:17:16.830 --> 00:17:21.730
the Pathan prince AARA was installed as king of Armenia by his uncle

296
00:17:21.880 --> 00:17:26.530
king a is the first of Paia without Roman approval on his way to Armenia,

297
00:17:27.050 --> 00:17:30.690
Trajan met with an Emissary of the Pathan king in an attempt to appease room.

298
00:17:31.410 --> 00:17:34.360
Austria's had deposed Aari and installed his brother,

299
00:17:34.880 --> 00:17:39.040
Parham Cyrus as the new ruler of Armenia and sought Trajan's approval for this

300
00:17:39.041 --> 00:17:42.840
change. Why exactly he thought the emperor would be okay with one brother,

301
00:17:42.940 --> 00:17:46.480
but not the other. We don't know Trajan was gracious to his guests,

302
00:17:46.620 --> 00:17:51.080
but mostly ignored their requests and kept on marching. The conquest of Armenia,

303
00:17:51.220 --> 00:17:55.320
it was quick and bloodless king Parma Cyrus ended Trajan's camp,

304
00:17:55.321 --> 00:17:58.360
took his di off his head and surrendered it to the emperor.

305
00:17:58.500 --> 00:18:02.040
He fully expected to get it back and become a client king of Rome in a move

306
00:18:02.041 --> 00:18:06.960
reminiscent of what ne road did with king te Dees half a century prior instead

307
00:18:07.400 --> 00:18:11.950
Trajan kept Armenia was an you Roman provinces installed governor to rule path

308
00:18:12.670 --> 00:18:15.950
Cyrus. He died soon after Rens all over the circumstances are not known.

309
00:18:15.951 --> 00:18:18.590
Some have speculated that he was killed on Trajan's orders

310
00:18:24.770 --> 00:18:28.550
In 115 CE the emperor launched his Mesopotamian campaign.

311
00:18:29.200 --> 00:18:32.220
The exact order of events is on clear from ancient sources.

312
00:18:32.490 --> 00:18:34.140
Besides the Pathan empire,

313
00:18:34.200 --> 00:18:38.580
the region was full of small kingdoms and city states with Kings and

314
00:18:39.260 --> 00:18:43.340
satraps like sending gifts and invoices to ensure they obtained the favor of

315
00:18:43.341 --> 00:18:47.620
Rome. Trajan split his army into divisions that went after multiple targets.

316
00:18:47.621 --> 00:18:50.450
He was then able to capture quick succession,

317
00:18:50.730 --> 00:18:55.530
a Ben Babylon Chax and Salus culminating with the conquest of the

318
00:18:56.050 --> 00:18:57.250
Pathan capital. At this point,

319
00:18:57.430 --> 00:19:00.770
the remin bar reached its greatest size in history.

320
00:19:00.930 --> 00:19:04.930
Cassie's D writes that Trajan was tempted to March into India like Alexander.

321
00:19:04.950 --> 00:19:07.730
The great did, but concluded that he was getting too old for this thing.

322
00:19:07.880 --> 00:19:11.640
Instead he was condemned with making a trip up to battle on and offering

323
00:19:12.000 --> 00:19:14.080
sacrifice in the house where Alexander died.

324
00:19:14.260 --> 00:19:17.480
He did make sure to specify in writing to the centers though,

325
00:19:17.590 --> 00:19:19.760
that he advanced further than Alexander.

326
00:19:20.160 --> 00:19:24.040
Although keeping his new possessions proved to be a bit of a problem when Trajan

327
00:19:24.041 --> 00:19:27.840
left many of the domains he conquered began rebelling and the garrisons that

328
00:19:27.841 --> 00:19:32.030
stayed behind were not enough to maintain control is also at this time that the

329
00:19:32.110 --> 00:19:33.630
emperor health started to decline.

330
00:19:33.850 --> 00:19:37.630
And some historians believe that he might have suffered heatstroke while laying

331
00:19:37.910 --> 00:19:39.790
siege, the city of hat trap to make matters,

332
00:19:39.840 --> 00:19:42.470
worse Jewish populations in multiple regions,

333
00:19:42.471 --> 00:19:46.430
such as siren and Egypt to began uprising. And Trajan had no choice,

334
00:19:46.490 --> 00:19:48.990
but to divert armies, to deal with these revolts

335
00:19:55.440 --> 00:19:57.660
Trajan hopes that this would be a minor setback.

336
00:19:58.000 --> 00:20:02.020
He left his troops in charge of his generals and set sail for Italy to regain

337
00:20:02.021 --> 00:20:02.820
his health.

338
00:20:02.820 --> 00:20:06.300
He then planned to return take command again and settle any conflicts that

339
00:20:06.301 --> 00:20:09.380
remains. That's not how things panned out though.

340
00:20:09.440 --> 00:20:13.850
He died suddenly on August the eighth for 117 CE aged

341
00:20:13.980 --> 00:20:17.330
63 in the port town of Seus in modern day Turkey.

342
00:20:17.770 --> 00:20:19.770
His cause of death remains somewhat controversial.

343
00:20:20.080 --> 00:20:22.130
Some sources say he died of a stroke,

344
00:20:22.370 --> 00:20:25.850
although both modern and ancient historians make mention of poison.

345
00:20:26.350 --> 00:20:28.370
His succession was also a bit contentious.

346
00:20:28.510 --> 00:20:31.050
His cousin Hadrian followed him through the throne,

347
00:20:31.150 --> 00:20:35.960
but whether actually named him as his heir or whether this was arranged by

348
00:20:35.961 --> 00:20:39.120
his wife Platina after his death remains debatable.

349
00:20:39.140 --> 00:20:42.160
One of Adrian's first acts was to pull out of Mesopotamia,

350
00:20:42.220 --> 00:20:45.880
as it became clear that Rome did not have the resources to keep the region

351
00:20:46.720 --> 00:20:49.480
Trajan might have ultimately failed in his Pathan campaign,

352
00:20:49.540 --> 00:20:54.400
but he left behind a cherished legacy that is still celebrated today.

353
00:20:54.780 --> 00:20:57.160
