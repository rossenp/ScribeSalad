00:00:00.060 --> 00:00:01.140
<v 0>Just before we get started,</v>

2
00:00:01.141 --> 00:00:04.110
some of you might know that I have another channel called mega projects,

3
00:00:04.111 --> 00:00:06.960
which is all about mega projects. I've mentioned it here before.

4
00:00:07.200 --> 00:00:10.950
If you don't subscribe to that channel, well, please do bus by popular demands.

5
00:00:10.951 --> 00:00:14.310
I wanted to cover things that weren't quite mega enough for that channel.

6
00:00:14.311 --> 00:00:17.280
So I started a new channel. It's called a side project.

7
00:00:17.281 --> 00:00:20.790
You can see what we did that a couple of secrets, Soviet space weapons,

8
00:00:20.791 --> 00:00:22.800
world war two's greatest airplane.

9
00:00:22.810 --> 00:00:27.780
Some of history's lost treasures and the movements of London bridge from London

10
00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:29.430
to a random town in America,

11
00:00:29.431 --> 00:00:32.970
stuff like that knew that he goes three times a week on that channel.

12
00:00:32.971 --> 00:00:36.780
So if you're thinking, Oh, Simon doesn't make enough videos for me. Well,

13
00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:39.750
don't worry. Hasn't I was assigned projects and subscribe.

14
00:00:39.751 --> 00:00:42.210
There is a link below and let's get started,

15
00:00:48.140 --> 00:00:50.570
Who was Arkin Arsen for 3,300 years.

16
00:00:50.571 --> 00:00:55.400
This question would have yielded only puzzled expressions as his deeds were

17
00:00:55.401 --> 00:00:55.911
considered.

18
00:00:55.911 --> 00:01:00.470
So vile and outrageous that the man who was once Pharaoh of Egypt was

19
00:01:00.471 --> 00:01:02.660
condemned to damnation Memorial.

20
00:01:02.661 --> 00:01:07.240
I a process where others tried to eliminate all mentions of him from history and

21
00:01:07.250 --> 00:01:11.060
make it look like he never existed for thousands of years.

22
00:01:11.061 --> 00:01:12.260
This was the case.

23
00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:16.730
It wasn't until the late 19th and early 20th centuries when modern archeologists

24
00:01:16.731 --> 00:01:19.010
excavated the lost city of a minor.

25
00:01:19.310 --> 00:01:23.420
And we were able to rediscover the reign of Akhenaten.

26
00:01:23.510 --> 00:01:27.260
So what did he do? That was so heinous? Well,

27
00:01:27.290 --> 00:01:30.920
he was arguably ancient Egypt's greatest heretic. I can,

28
00:01:31.310 --> 00:01:35.330
Artan abandoned the traditional gods who have been worshiped for thousands of

29
00:01:35.331 --> 00:01:39.830
years. And instead instituted a new religion called art aneurysm,

30
00:01:39.860 --> 00:01:42.920
which was centered around the worship of art in the sun disk.

31
00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:47.210
He also moved to the capital of Egypt from Thebes to a new city that he built

32
00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:51.530
called. Amaanah also called arc and art. And during his reign for this reason,

33
00:01:51.531 --> 00:01:53.240
the timespan that covers his reign,

34
00:01:53.241 --> 00:01:57.410
as well as those that immediately followed is also referred to as the amount of

35
00:01:57.411 --> 00:02:01.880
period, the extent to which all can autumn suppress the old forms of religious

36
00:02:01.881 --> 00:02:04.490
expression. It's still a matter of debate among scholars,

37
00:02:04.491 --> 00:02:08.180
but the people of ancient Egypt would definitely not happy with him almost

38
00:02:08.181 --> 00:02:09.470
immediately. After he died,

39
00:02:09.500 --> 00:02:14.450
they got to work restoring the old ways and the pharaohs who followed distanced

40
00:02:14.451 --> 00:02:16.430
themselves from his beliefs. Nowadays,

41
00:02:16.431 --> 00:02:18.650
we're much more familiar with his son teaching common,

42
00:02:18.651 --> 00:02:22.940
who realistically didn't actually do anything of note in his lifetime.

43
00:02:23.090 --> 00:02:27.020
But today we seek to rectify this a bit by taking a look at Argonaut and the

44
00:02:27.080 --> 00:02:31.100
heretical Pharaoh who launched a religious revolution.

45
00:02:37.040 --> 00:02:37.130
<v 1>[Inaudible].</v>

46
00:02:37.130 --> 00:02:40.700
<v 0>I can, Austin was born sometime in the first half of the 14th century, BC,</v>

47
00:02:40.701 --> 00:02:45.470
most likely during the 1370s, he was part of Egypt's 18th dynasty.

48
00:02:45.600 --> 00:02:47.660
That first one of the new kingdom,

49
00:02:47.661 --> 00:02:51.680
which arguably saw the Egyptian EMBA reached the peak of its power.

50
00:02:51.740 --> 00:02:54.350
Most of the pharaohs we've covered so far like tutoring,

51
00:02:54.860 --> 00:02:55.730
common had Shep sprouts.

52
00:02:55.731 --> 00:02:59.250
And so mostly the third have all been part of the same dynasties.

53
00:02:59.380 --> 00:03:04.270
It's pretty fair to say that this was a crucial POS in the history of Egypt.

54
00:03:04.360 --> 00:03:08.590
I can Austin's father was Farrah Amenhotep the third also known as Amenhotep the

55
00:03:09.250 --> 00:03:12.340
magnificent. He is generally considered one of ancient Deidre. It was gracious.

56
00:03:12.341 --> 00:03:16.270
Rulers presiding over our lengths that he reign of almost 40 years marked by

57
00:03:16.450 --> 00:03:20.680
prosperity, peace and stability. I can Arden's mother was Ty,

58
00:03:20.681 --> 00:03:22.390
the Pharaoh's great Royal wife.

59
00:03:22.480 --> 00:03:25.300
He was actually the second Psalm that the two had together and was not

60
00:03:25.301 --> 00:03:28.870
originally planned to take over the throne. However, his older brother,

61
00:03:28.871 --> 00:03:33.130
a crown Prince that most a died of an unknown cause sometime during the second

62
00:03:33.131 --> 00:03:35.770
half of their father's reign and therefore, how can art?

63
00:03:35.980 --> 00:03:38.980
And they came the next in line. He was an called Akhenaten at the time,

64
00:03:38.981 --> 00:03:39.401
of course,

65
00:03:39.401 --> 00:03:44.140
this name was roughly translated to one who is serviceable to Arten

66
00:03:44.230 --> 00:03:47.530
and he only adopted it as Pharaoh. Once he institutes it,

67
00:03:47.710 --> 00:03:51.010
isn't you religious policies up until the last point he was Amenhotep the

68
00:03:51.011 --> 00:03:53.470
fourth, but we'll stick to Akhenaten's.

69
00:03:53.480 --> 00:03:56.080
You avoid a lot of confusion with his father.

70
00:03:56.290 --> 00:03:58.450
We cannot tell you almost anything about his early life.

71
00:03:58.600 --> 00:04:02.920
Some Egyptologists speculate that he may have served as a high priest before

72
00:04:02.921 --> 00:04:06.310
taking the throne because his brother had done the same while he was still the

73
00:04:06.311 --> 00:04:07.144
success errands.

74
00:04:07.180 --> 00:04:10.930
Maybe this is where he first developed his strong devotion to the art,

75
00:04:10.931 --> 00:04:13.030
and also spelled Asian this day,

76
00:04:13.170 --> 00:04:16.030
he actually predated our economic and by a long way,

77
00:04:16.390 --> 00:04:18.520
it's first mentioned date back to the old kingdom.

78
00:04:18.520 --> 00:04:23.470
Although back then it seemed to be simply a word used to refer to the sun disk

79
00:04:23.471 --> 00:04:26.170
itself. And it wasn't an actual deity,

80
00:04:26.200 --> 00:04:30.220
but it's rather an element of the sun, God, by the middle kingdom, though,

81
00:04:30.221 --> 00:04:33.070
there were already references to Otten as a creator.

82
00:04:33.071 --> 00:04:37.660
So at some point centuries before and came along art and had already

83
00:04:37.661 --> 00:04:42.310
morphed into a sort of solidarity and other hotly debated aspect of

84
00:04:42.311 --> 00:04:45.790
Akhenaten's life is when exactly he took over the throne.

85
00:04:45.820 --> 00:04:49.300
There are some scholars who assert that Amenhotep the third mate,

86
00:04:49.301 --> 00:04:51.700
his son co regions, while he was still Pharaoh,

87
00:04:51.760 --> 00:04:54.220
many others argue strongly against this view.

88
00:04:54.221 --> 00:04:59.050
And even the lengths of the code Regency is heavily disputed for all purposes.

89
00:04:59.110 --> 00:05:02.560
We're going to assume that [inaudible] became the new Pharaoh of Egypt after the

90
00:05:02.561 --> 00:05:06.670
death of his father. This happens around 1353 BC Pharaoh.

91
00:05:06.671 --> 00:05:11.530
Amenhotep the third died in his late forties or early fifties and is 38 or

92
00:05:12.190 --> 00:05:15.010
39th retinal year. And he was buried in the Valley of the Kings.

93
00:05:15.190 --> 00:05:18.700
His son followed him to the throne still under the name almond hotel.

94
00:05:18.720 --> 00:05:22.210
The fourth. It was around this time that he married his great Royal wife.

95
00:05:22.740 --> 00:05:23.573
<v 1>Never TT.</v>

96
00:05:29.930 --> 00:05:33.810
<v 0>He, yes, back in orphans, rain where a traditional, for lack of a better word,</v>

97
00:05:33.811 --> 00:05:38.160
where he followed the regular customs of the time and mainly continued policies

98
00:05:38.161 --> 00:05:41.280
and practices that had been set out by his father.

99
00:05:41.340 --> 00:05:45.720
He expressed his worship of the Otten, but not in an over away.

100
00:05:45.780 --> 00:05:49.560
This wasn't considered unusual because Amenhotep the third also emphasize the

101
00:05:49.561 --> 00:05:52.740
worship of the art. And as a callback to their ancestors,

102
00:05:52.800 --> 00:05:54.690
between the middle kingdom and new kingdom,

103
00:05:54.870 --> 00:05:58.430
there was a span of time dubbed the intermediate period.

104
00:05:58.490 --> 00:06:00.500
It was considered a dark time for Egypt,

105
00:06:00.501 --> 00:06:03.800
as parts of the lambs were not ruled by native adoptions,

106
00:06:03.801 --> 00:06:08.600
but rather by Hexall salsa group of people from the Lavonne's who arrived in the

107
00:06:08.601 --> 00:06:11.360
area and took over in the 17th century, BC,

108
00:06:11.450 --> 00:06:15.230
eventually the heck SaaS were defeated and driven away permanently by Moz.

109
00:06:15.231 --> 00:06:18.500
The first who founded the 18th dynasty, the one that we're in right now,

110
00:06:18.620 --> 00:06:20.900
the point is that after the pixels were gone,

111
00:06:20.910 --> 00:06:24.440
the pharaohs who followed were eager to get back to their roots,

112
00:06:24.560 --> 00:06:28.520
they wanted to do a way with the traditions and culture of the heck sauce and

113
00:06:28.730 --> 00:06:32.690
bring back many customs and religious practices from their forefathers,

114
00:06:32.691 --> 00:06:35.420
from the middle kingdom and beyond Zinn's. Well,

115
00:06:35.450 --> 00:06:40.100
that is how the arson entered the Egyptian public consciousness once more.

116
00:06:40.220 --> 00:06:42.740
Amenhotep the third might've worshiped often,

117
00:06:42.741 --> 00:06:47.270
but he never neglected a moon who by that point had become one of the most

118
00:06:47.271 --> 00:06:52.100
important gods in the Egyptian Pantheon and the patron devotee of Thebes.

119
00:06:52.200 --> 00:06:52.880
In fact,

120
00:06:52.880 --> 00:06:57.470
I'm insignificance during the 18th dynasty grew so much that he began being

121
00:06:57.471 --> 00:07:02.210
identified alongside RA the SunGard as a single entity named

122
00:07:02.240 --> 00:07:03.170
almond. Rob,

123
00:07:03.350 --> 00:07:07.370
the first indication that Akhenaten had plans of his own came a few years into

124
00:07:07.371 --> 00:07:10.220
his reign. When he scheduled a scent festival for himself,

125
00:07:10.490 --> 00:07:12.800
this was one of Egypt's oldest traditions.

126
00:07:12.830 --> 00:07:17.120
It was a sort of Jubilee where the grands feast meant to celebrate the original

127
00:07:17.121 --> 00:07:20.570
unification between upper and lower Egypt. Traditionally,

128
00:07:20.571 --> 00:07:24.800
a Farrah organized his first sent festival once he rained for 30 years and in

129
00:07:24.801 --> 00:07:26.540
three year increments from then on,

130
00:07:26.810 --> 00:07:30.290
I can often did it after only two or three years.

131
00:07:30.350 --> 00:07:32.780
The reason for this has been widely speculated.

132
00:07:32.781 --> 00:07:37.280
Some scholars think he was mentally preparing himself for the more drastic steps

133
00:07:37.281 --> 00:07:39.320
he was about to take others believe I can.

134
00:07:39.680 --> 00:07:43.520
Austin wanted to symbolically link his reign to that of his father.

135
00:07:43.550 --> 00:07:47.180
So he organized a SED festival just three years after the previous.

136
00:07:47.181 --> 00:07:51.800
One of Amenhotep the third and some concluded that the Pharaoh simply saw it as

137
00:07:51.801 --> 00:07:55.370
a convenient excuse for him to build loads of new monuments and dentals

138
00:07:55.371 --> 00:07:58.880
dedicated to do the Otten without anyone raising an eyebrow.

139
00:07:58.970 --> 00:08:02.870
Indeed the greatest one of all was the temple complex constructed right outside

140
00:08:02.871 --> 00:08:06.770
Karnak named GAM Pitocin or Otten his founds,

141
00:08:06.771 --> 00:08:10.730
which went against Egyptian building conventions by having no roof so that the

142
00:08:10.731 --> 00:08:14.360
sunlight could freely enter the complex. By the fifth year of his reign,

143
00:08:14.361 --> 00:08:18.230
the Pharaoh decided it was time for a true revolution. He changed Israel.

144
00:08:18.230 --> 00:08:22.880
Tottori officially adopting the name Akhenaten and instituting the worship of

145
00:08:22.881 --> 00:08:24.170
the arson throughout his kingdom.

146
00:08:24.320 --> 00:08:28.460
He expressed his devotion to the sun disk in several HINNs and poems.

147
00:08:28.670 --> 00:08:32.840
The most famous of which is the gratin to the art and the composition of 13

148
00:08:32.841 --> 00:08:36.710
stanzas, which was found in described on several rock tombs.

149
00:08:36.800 --> 00:08:40.850
Unsurprisingly many Egyptians were outraged by economics and particularly the

150
00:08:40.851 --> 00:08:45.500
priests who were about to lose the majority of that power influence and wealth.

151
00:08:45.590 --> 00:08:45.951
However,

152
00:08:45.951 --> 00:08:49.790
the Pharaoh was not an idiot and he knew that he would not be able to pull off

153
00:08:49.940 --> 00:08:52.490
his religious reform without support from anyone.

154
00:08:52.640 --> 00:08:54.800
And he got that support from the army.

155
00:08:54.860 --> 00:08:57.510
The kingdom was coming off from a period of prosperity.

156
00:08:57.511 --> 00:09:00.150
So the soldiers were already pretty content,

157
00:09:00.360 --> 00:09:04.320
but I can art and still made sure to praise and celebrate them whenever the

158
00:09:04.321 --> 00:09:08.280
opportunity arose as well as maintain good relations with his military leaders.

159
00:09:08.370 --> 00:09:12.570
Clearly this worked as there were no major uprisings during his reign and the

160
00:09:12.571 --> 00:09:16.980
disavowal of the cult of art and only took place after his death because of his

161
00:09:16.981 --> 00:09:20.400
actions. Zack and Austin has been heralded by some modern scholars.

162
00:09:20.440 --> 00:09:22.260
The first Banu theist in history,

163
00:09:22.261 --> 00:09:26.190
meaning the first person to express belief in a single God,

164
00:09:26.250 --> 00:09:31.170
others reject this label and qualify as rain more as a henotheistic period of

165
00:09:31.171 --> 00:09:35.100
Egypt's, meaning that while worship was focused on a single diety,

166
00:09:35.101 --> 00:09:39.150
he didn't necessarily reject to the possible existence of others either way.

167
00:09:39.450 --> 00:09:42.690
OCHIN often wanted nothing to do with the old gods of Egypt anymore.

168
00:09:42.830 --> 00:09:47.070
And he felt that his worship of the art and needed to be concentrated in a

169
00:09:47.071 --> 00:09:48.030
Virgin site.

170
00:09:48.031 --> 00:09:52.020
One that was free from the touch and influence of the form of Pantheon.

171
00:09:58.070 --> 00:09:58.220
<v 2>[Inaudible].</v>

172
00:09:58.220 --> 00:10:02.450
<v 0>As shocking as Akhenaten's abandonment of the old gods was.</v>

173
00:10:02.630 --> 00:10:04.280
So it was his decision to leave.

174
00:10:04.940 --> 00:10:08.240
Seebs the city that had functioned as Egypt's Capitol for the grades of bards of

175
00:10:08.241 --> 00:10:09.350
its history up until then.

176
00:10:09.470 --> 00:10:13.310
But the Pharaoh wanted to found a new capital in pristine lands.

177
00:10:13.670 --> 00:10:17.750
HR is an uninhabited size on the Eastern bank of the Nile and took around 20,000

178
00:10:17.751 --> 00:10:19.280
people with him to his new sediments.

179
00:10:19.340 --> 00:10:23.090
He called this Akon tartan or horizon of the atom,

180
00:10:23.210 --> 00:10:25.490
but it is better known by its later name.

181
00:10:26.240 --> 00:10:30.440
Amaanah obviously building a new city from scratch in a short period of time was

182
00:10:30.441 --> 00:10:31.550
a huge undertaking.

183
00:10:31.551 --> 00:10:36.260
And there is grim evidence to suggest that the people then Amano worked to the

184
00:10:36.261 --> 00:10:39.200
bone once the largest cemetery in Amaanah was excavated,

185
00:10:39.201 --> 00:10:43.280
modern archeologists found the remains of 432 people.

186
00:10:43.310 --> 00:10:47.750
The ones whose age was established 70% died before the age of 35,

187
00:10:47.751 --> 00:10:49.640
while only nine people live past 50.

188
00:10:49.940 --> 00:10:53.570
And also knew that the children had the growth stunted you to malnutrition.

189
00:10:53.720 --> 00:10:57.200
While many adults had spinal damage from being overworked and even darker

190
00:10:57.201 --> 00:10:59.480
picture is painted by another cemetery.

191
00:10:59.570 --> 00:11:02.480
This time located near the Royal limestone quarry,

192
00:11:02.570 --> 00:11:05.120
a whopping 92% of the individuals buried.

193
00:11:05.300 --> 00:11:10.280
There were under 25 years old while half of them were under 15 Amaanah might've

194
00:11:10.281 --> 00:11:12.770
been the ideal city in the mind of Arkin Artan,

195
00:11:12.800 --> 00:11:16.790
but all indications seem to suggest that he only cared about himself and his God

196
00:11:16.791 --> 00:11:20.690
while the people of Amaanah lived in miserable conditions and were being worked

197
00:11:20.691 --> 00:11:24.500
to death in order to cope with the construction demands of the Farrow build

198
00:11:24.620 --> 00:11:29.420
created a new type of stone block called Talla tops made out of limestone.

199
00:11:29.450 --> 00:11:32.570
They were much smaller than the blocks used in Egyptian construction,

200
00:11:32.571 --> 00:11:36.740
but they were also cut to a standard size, which was not typically done before.

201
00:11:36.800 --> 00:11:40.580
Theoretically, this made them more efficient, but they still did not catch on.

202
00:11:40.581 --> 00:11:44.150
And the usage of talent times ended shortly after the amount of periods.

203
00:11:44.480 --> 00:11:47.690
It probably would not surprise you to learn that the main structures in a mana

204
00:11:47.810 --> 00:11:51.410
where the raw palaces were Akhenaten's and temples for the autumn,

205
00:11:51.470 --> 00:11:55.000
the main place of worship was great temple of the Austin and the center of the

206
00:11:55.001 --> 00:11:58.540
city while the secondary small art and temple was located near to the RA

207
00:11:58.570 --> 00:12:00.610
palaces, like all other art and symbols,

208
00:12:00.730 --> 00:12:04.690
they had two features that distinguished them from traditional Egyptian places

209
00:12:04.691 --> 00:12:05.320
of worship.

210
00:12:05.320 --> 00:12:09.790
They were open now with no roof and they also did not feature any cult images of

211
00:12:09.791 --> 00:12:11.680
the arson, which was in fact,

212
00:12:11.681 --> 00:12:15.490
a recurring SIEM and organism while the other gods were commonly depicted as

213
00:12:15.491 --> 00:12:17.770
having human bodies and human or animal heads,

214
00:12:18.070 --> 00:12:22.630
Zack and Alton insisted that they often was everywhere in every one and thus

215
00:12:22.631 --> 00:12:25.810
transcended the need for any kind of physical form. Therefore the autumn,

216
00:12:25.870 --> 00:12:30.490
it was always depicted as only a disk emitting certain res something else that

217
00:12:30.520 --> 00:12:35.200
came out of a mana was a new art style dubbed simply the Amman or off style.

218
00:12:35.290 --> 00:12:38.350
Again, it did not last longer than Akhenaten's reign,

219
00:12:38.351 --> 00:12:42.580
but some works have survived and they create a pretty stark contrast to the

220
00:12:42.581 --> 00:12:46.330
traditional ancient Egyptian art. The most striking differences concerned,

221
00:12:46.331 --> 00:12:49.660
the ways humans were depicted and the amount of stall they were told her and

222
00:12:49.661 --> 00:12:50.380
more slender.

223
00:12:50.380 --> 00:12:54.190
The facial features where Ilan gauged in the chest hands and legs with sin while

224
00:12:54.191 --> 00:12:55.930
the stomach and thighs were often bloated,

225
00:12:56.050 --> 00:12:59.590
the same skin color was used for men and women in art and art and himself was

226
00:12:59.591 --> 00:13:01.150
depicted with feminine features.

227
00:13:01.210 --> 00:13:05.470
Some Egyptologists believed that this was actually a more realistic view of what

228
00:13:05.471 --> 00:13:09.190
the Pharaoh really looks like because he might have suffered from one or more

229
00:13:09.191 --> 00:13:11.470
genetic disorders like Marfan's syndrome,

230
00:13:11.471 --> 00:13:15.070
which caused elongated extremities or Kleinfelter syndrome,

231
00:13:15.071 --> 00:13:17.170
which led to male breast enlargements.

232
00:13:17.260 --> 00:13:20.830
It is speculated that other pharaohs from the 18th dynasty also suffered from

233
00:13:20.831 --> 00:13:24.400
these elements, but this is yet to be proven conclusively.

234
00:13:30.660 --> 00:13:33.450
How can all of a sudden ruled Egypt for approximately 17 years?

235
00:13:33.451 --> 00:13:36.570
And his reign was clearly dominated by his devotion to the arson,

236
00:13:36.720 --> 00:13:38.940
which became increasingly fanatical as the years,

237
00:13:38.941 --> 00:13:42.960
went by not satisfied with simply building a new capital dedicated to his God.

238
00:13:43.170 --> 00:13:47.550
He later has older timbales dismantled and their priests killed as he ordered

239
00:13:47.551 --> 00:13:50.040
the names of the old gods. Be chiseled out of all,

240
00:13:50.050 --> 00:13:53.310
cravings from John stelae to small tablets.

241
00:13:53.340 --> 00:13:56.550
We don't actually have a lot of detailed information about what happens in Egypt

242
00:13:56.580 --> 00:14:01.080
during the reign of Akhenaten's because of the whole damnation memorializing and

243
00:14:01.320 --> 00:14:03.060
having all mentions of him destroyed.

244
00:14:03.090 --> 00:14:06.360
But we do know a lot more about his international relations,

245
00:14:06.361 --> 00:14:10.080
thanks to a treasure trove of information that somehow survived known as the

246
00:14:10.440 --> 00:14:10.980
Amaanah letters.

247
00:14:10.980 --> 00:14:14.820
This consists of over 380 tablets written in the Akkadian language,

248
00:14:14.821 --> 00:14:19.260
using cuneiform that mostly represent diplomatic correspondence from neighboring

249
00:14:19.261 --> 00:14:21.720
city, administrators and Kings to the Pharaoh.

250
00:14:21.780 --> 00:14:24.960
The tone you used in the tablets changes, depending on who the sender was,

251
00:14:25.020 --> 00:14:27.240
some of them came from vassals of Egypt.

252
00:14:27.241 --> 00:14:31.890
So naturally the tone was very deferential addressing [inaudible] is the son

253
00:14:32.010 --> 00:14:35.850
my Lord, while referring to themselves as his sevens, others,

254
00:14:35.851 --> 00:14:38.580
while still cordials came from rulers of similar rank,

255
00:14:38.581 --> 00:14:41.100
like the Kings of maintaining your battle on,

256
00:14:41.250 --> 00:14:43.620
and the tone reflected their equal status,

257
00:14:43.650 --> 00:14:46.800
regardless of the way they were written. Many letters had similar content.

258
00:14:46.980 --> 00:14:51.650
They expressed displeasure, disappointment, concern, and uneasiness economics.

259
00:14:51.800 --> 00:14:54.020
And for neglecting some of his international duties,

260
00:14:54.080 --> 00:14:55.790
some of these were specific, for example,

261
00:14:55.940 --> 00:14:59.480
the King of Matana to Schrott up complains in one tab,

262
00:14:59.510 --> 00:15:03.800
it's the dock and Autin seemingly reneged on a deal made by his father to give

263
00:15:03.801 --> 00:15:08.540
the King solid gold statues, his dowry for a princess bride from atonic.

264
00:15:08.600 --> 00:15:12.470
It would seem that I can often sent to [inaudible] gold plated statues. Instead,

265
00:15:12.560 --> 00:15:16.370
many of us has concerns the most pressing issue in the region at that time,

266
00:15:16.371 --> 00:15:18.890
the rise of a dangerous foe, the Hittites,

267
00:15:19.130 --> 00:15:22.790
and they showed how little lacking art and cared about matters that had nothing

268
00:15:22.791 --> 00:15:25.010
to do with the awesome, it was. In fact,

269
00:15:25.040 --> 00:15:28.640
during economic sins reign that the Hitomi has reached the peak of that power.

270
00:15:28.641 --> 00:15:31.100
And by the time dude in common games of the throne,

271
00:15:31.130 --> 00:15:34.220
the Hittite empire was just as strong as Egypt. First,

272
00:15:34.221 --> 00:15:38.270
the Madani asked economic and for assistance and that war with the Hittites,

273
00:15:38.300 --> 00:15:40.640
but that was no help. Forthcoming. In fact,

274
00:15:40.641 --> 00:15:44.690
Egypt hope to Curry favor with the new regional power is withdrew all support to

275
00:15:44.691 --> 00:15:48.890
Madani allowing the King that you assassinate Tish Rotter and sank his

276
00:15:49.700 --> 00:15:51.350
capital of wash. Connie. Of course,

277
00:15:51.351 --> 00:15:54.980
this only serve to show the rest of the world that Egypt was we can vulnerable.

278
00:15:54.981 --> 00:15:59.480
So the Hittites pressed the attack and went into Syria wet that West city States

279
00:15:59.481 --> 00:16:02.720
and kingdoms that were vassals of Egypt since theoretically under its

280
00:16:02.721 --> 00:16:03.290
protection.

281
00:16:03.290 --> 00:16:07.310
The city States that weren't conquered were angered by Egypt's inaction and they

282
00:16:07.311 --> 00:16:09.860
rebelled prompting Argonaut. And to lose the territory,

283
00:16:10.040 --> 00:16:13.520
he used strapped a minion over in Syria, as far as we can tell, he never.

284
00:16:13.630 --> 00:16:14.890
<v 2>I attempted to get it back.</v>

285
00:16:21.130 --> 00:16:24.580
<v 0>The last years of Akhenaten's reign, not one big question, Mark,</v>

286
00:16:24.610 --> 00:16:27.910
the most confusing and controversial aspects was his successions.

287
00:16:27.911 --> 00:16:31.810
The couple of years in between the reigns of Akhenaten and his son to Tom

288
00:16:31.840 --> 00:16:32.410
common,

289
00:16:32.410 --> 00:16:36.340
the full name is that we know there were two other fairies with very short

290
00:16:36.760 --> 00:16:40.570
reigns between father and son smack and RN Neff and a ferritin. However,

291
00:16:40.630 --> 00:16:42.970
that is pretty much what we know who they were,

292
00:16:43.090 --> 00:16:46.660
how they were connected to economics and why they became Pharos, uh,

293
00:16:46.690 --> 00:16:50.170
all still mysteries that spur debates among Egyptologists.

294
00:16:50.350 --> 00:16:53.350
We're not sure if [inaudible] was male or female,

295
00:16:53.351 --> 00:16:56.830
but some evidence may suggest that he served as code region during the last

296
00:16:57.100 --> 00:16:58.210
years of Akhenaten's life.

297
00:16:58.240 --> 00:17:02.260
Some believed that the same can be said for [inaudible] who was a woman and may

298
00:17:02.261 --> 00:17:06.310
have been one of the Pharaoh's daughters or more likely the new name of

299
00:17:06.311 --> 00:17:10.300
Nefertiti. Once she became fair, right in our own right economics and died,

300
00:17:10.750 --> 00:17:13.870
sucker 1330, six BC of unknown causes afterwards,

301
00:17:14.080 --> 00:17:18.460
men could Carre ans NEFA never attend either a rule together as co regions or

302
00:17:18.461 --> 00:17:22.150
one or the other, or both of them had individual reigns as Pharaoh.

303
00:17:22.180 --> 00:17:25.450
We simply cannot say with any certainty and it wasn't until it's in 10

304
00:17:25.451 --> 00:17:26.020
increments,

305
00:17:26.020 --> 00:17:30.640
took the throne circus 1334 BC that the historical record became clearer.

306
00:17:30.820 --> 00:17:34.810
This is because King tox was still a young boy when he became Pharaoh and his

307
00:17:35.350 --> 00:17:36.910
advisors made most of the decisions for him.

308
00:17:37.030 --> 00:17:40.480
They realized that the cult of the art and had no chance of surviving without

309
00:17:40.810 --> 00:17:43.150
hacking art. And so they steadily made changes,

310
00:17:43.151 --> 00:17:47.980
do revert back to the old ways and the old gods and Shaun everything

311
00:17:47.981 --> 00:17:49.090
done by the form of fair.

312
00:17:49.500 --> 00:17:51.930
This included the monitor itself as the city was abandoned.

313
00:17:51.930 --> 00:17:55.290
When the Capitol was reverted back to Thebes, it was still standing though.

314
00:17:55.380 --> 00:17:59.310
It wasn't actually destroyed until later when a Pharaoh called Horam Hab came to

315
00:17:59.311 --> 00:18:03.150
power, he was more thorough when it came to wiping out the amount of period from

316
00:18:03.151 --> 00:18:03.870
history.

317
00:18:03.870 --> 00:18:07.770
So we had the temples and monuments built by economics and dismantled and then

318
00:18:07.771 --> 00:18:09.180
recycled for new structures.

319
00:18:09.330 --> 00:18:12.000
That's why they were taught about ants from Amaanah that we used as filler

320
00:18:12.001 --> 00:18:16.140
material for the pillars at Luxor, as far as [inaudible] was concerned,

321
00:18:16.170 --> 00:18:19.530
his wish you won't be surprised to find out was to be buried in a Monat.

322
00:18:19.620 --> 00:18:22.710
You had a Royal tomb built for himself in the local necropolis called the

323
00:18:23.760 --> 00:18:27.780
[inaudible] extra chambers NEFA TT. And one of his daughters who died young,

324
00:18:27.840 --> 00:18:29.730
maybe even during childbirth, he said,

325
00:18:30.150 --> 00:18:33.930
let's a tune be made for me in the Eastern mountains of astronauts and less,

326
00:18:33.931 --> 00:18:37.440
my burial will be made in it in the millions of Jubilees,

327
00:18:37.470 --> 00:18:39.840
which the arson I father to create for me,

328
00:18:40.020 --> 00:18:43.890
let the burial of the King's chief wife NEFA TTB made in the millions of years,

329
00:18:43.891 --> 00:18:45.360
which my father to create for heart.

330
00:18:45.600 --> 00:18:48.660
And that's also the barrier of the Kings daughter be made in it.

331
00:18:48.840 --> 00:18:51.150
You probably won't be surprised to learn that his wish was ignored.

332
00:18:51.240 --> 00:18:53.100
I can Artan was buried in his tomb initially,

333
00:18:53.101 --> 00:18:56.190
but it was later moved to the Valley of the Kings and his Royal tomb was

334
00:18:56.191 --> 00:19:00.120
desecrated where exactly he ended up is again, a matter of some disputes.

335
00:19:00.150 --> 00:19:03.370
Most of Janice, his final resting place was KV 55,

336
00:19:03.371 --> 00:19:08.130
a small undecorated single chamber to which only contained a single adult mummy

337
00:19:08.340 --> 00:19:12.690
placed in a sarcophagus whose facial features had been destroyed as well.

338
00:19:12.750 --> 00:19:14.760
All names and personal identifiers.

339
00:19:14.880 --> 00:19:18.660
The identity of the mummy is a controversial topic made even more confusing by

340
00:19:18.840 --> 00:19:21.120
the fact that it was originally designed to be a woman.

341
00:19:21.240 --> 00:19:25.260
The body was intact male. Although the coffin itself was designed for a woman.

342
00:19:25.350 --> 00:19:27.270
Many believe this is economics.

343
00:19:27.280 --> 00:19:31.440
And although others have positive that the mummy may belong to the obscure smack

344
00:19:31.560 --> 00:19:35.490
and Carre modern DNA test indicated that the mummy was related to teaching

345
00:19:35.491 --> 00:19:35.971
common,

346
00:19:35.971 --> 00:19:39.870
but other scholars criticized them saying that the DNA was too degraded and the

347
00:19:39.871 --> 00:19:43.110
mummies handled by so many people over time that the results would be an

348
00:19:43.111 --> 00:19:46.020
accurate, this is another contentious point for the time being,

349
00:19:46.350 --> 00:19:47.580
but is somehow fitting,

350
00:19:47.581 --> 00:19:52.440
given all the other aspects of Akhenaten's reign as a seemingly

351
00:19:52.470 --> 00:19:57.330
destined to go down in history is arguably the most controversial Farrow in the

352
00:19:57.331 --> 00:20:00.090
history of Egypt. So I really hope you found that video. Interesting.
