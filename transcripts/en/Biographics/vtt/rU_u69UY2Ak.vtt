00:00:17.890 --> 00:00:21.870
Peter, the great was perhaps the most important in Russian history.

6
00:00:21.930 --> 00:00:26.070
He took a kingdom that was stuck in its old ways and transformed it into a

7
00:00:26.071 --> 00:00:29.430
modern and powerful empire. He looked to the west for inspiration.

8
00:00:29.431 --> 00:00:33.870
Peter ignored the I isolationist policies and traditions of his predecessors

9
00:00:34.070 --> 00:00:36.990
becoming the first star to visit other European countries. There.

10
00:00:36.991 --> 00:00:40.350
He gains knowledge into current military and scientific advancements ship

11
00:00:40.510 --> 00:00:43.540
building T diplomatic affairs, even fashion trends,

12
00:00:43.840 --> 00:00:45.220
and brought them home with him.

13
00:00:45.290 --> 00:00:49.980
<v 1>Peter's ambition to turn Russia into a great maritime power required expansion,</v>

14
00:00:49.981 --> 00:00:52.060
which in turn required war. In fact,

15
00:00:52.120 --> 00:00:55.660
he spends most of his adult years involved in one conflict or another,

16
00:00:55.760 --> 00:00:59.420
but in the end he achieved his goal, whether it was worth it or not,

17
00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:00.353
we cannot say,

18
00:01:00.520 --> 00:01:05.410
but it's certain had a major ever lasting impact on the history of Russia

19
00:01:05.910 --> 00:01:06.930
and Europe as a whole.

20
00:01:13.390 --> 00:01:16.330
<v 0>He was born Pieta Alexia Avi on June the ninth,</v>

21
00:01:16.480 --> 00:01:20.570
1672 war may the 30th going by the old star calendar.

22
00:01:20.750 --> 00:01:23.360
He was part of the influence house of Romanov,

23
00:01:23.361 --> 00:01:27.840
which ruled Russia over 300 years until the February revolution of 1917.

24
00:01:27.841 --> 00:01:32.240
When SAR Nicholas II was forced to abdicate subsequently being executed along

25
00:01:32.241 --> 00:01:36.200
with his family by the BOLs of ex Peter was the son of Alex Macha, Lavi,

26
00:01:36.520 --> 00:01:39.080
better known as Alexis. The first SAR of Russia,

27
00:01:39.460 --> 00:01:41.760
he was Alexis's 14th child overall,

28
00:01:41.761 --> 00:01:45.350
but the fur and only son that the SAR had with his second wife,

29
00:01:45.620 --> 00:01:46.910
Natalia NAA.

30
00:01:46.980 --> 00:01:50.910
This will come into play later when Peter will face challenges to his throne.

31
00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:51.760
When he was born,

32
00:01:51.760 --> 00:01:55.950
Peter was a healthy boy of normal size and was described as having his mother's

33
00:01:55.960 --> 00:02:00.110
black, vaguely tar our eyes and a tough of or hair. In fact,

34
00:02:00.111 --> 00:02:03.820
we can give you the precise measurements of the Royal infants to a Russian

35
00:02:03.821 --> 00:02:05.580
tradition called taking the measure.

36
00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:10.420
It involved painting an image of the boys' patron sane to surprisingly was Peter

37
00:02:10.480 --> 00:02:14.300
the apostle on a board with the same dimensions as the baby,

38
00:02:14.350 --> 00:02:18.740
which were in this case 19 and a quarter inches long and five and a quarter

39
00:02:18.980 --> 00:02:19.690
inches wide.

40
00:02:19.690 --> 00:02:24.250
Peter's good health was considered a blessing on a house that seemed with fee.

41
00:02:24.610 --> 00:02:29.050
He Alex's first wife, Maria Miller love sky gave the SAR five sons,

42
00:02:29.051 --> 00:02:32.730
but only two of them reached adulthoods and both were in poor health.

43
00:02:32.870 --> 00:02:37.450
The eldest Fido Alexia had been left partially paralyzed by a mysterious

44
00:02:37.451 --> 00:02:40.170
childhood illness. Well, the other son, Ivan Alexia,

45
00:02:40.290 --> 00:02:44.640
Avi was described as being infer in the body and mind as ruler Peter,

46
00:02:44.660 --> 00:02:47.760
the greats would become noted for his westernization of Russia. However,

47
00:02:47.870 --> 00:02:51.880
this process was initiated by his mother whose own upbringing had a Western

48
00:02:51.950 --> 00:02:55.000
influence and she would pass on her interests to her son,

49
00:02:55.130 --> 00:02:57.320
right from the beginning of their marriage SAR,

50
00:02:58.120 --> 00:03:01.160
Natalia shared with her new husband, her love of music and theater.

51
00:03:01.290 --> 00:03:02.123
<v 1>Prior to this,</v>

52
00:03:02.200 --> 00:03:06.560
an edict of Alexi turned the Sodom of Russia into that town from Footloose where

53
00:03:06.690 --> 00:03:09.320
music and dancing had been banned, except that in Russia,

54
00:03:09.350 --> 00:03:13.960
they could get you beaten with rods or even banished Alex and Natalia had a

55
00:03:13.961 --> 00:03:15.640
choir and an orchestra playing music.

56
00:03:15.790 --> 00:03:17.840
Soon after they became patrons of the theater,

57
00:03:18.100 --> 00:03:22.150
the song asked devotion to his new wife only increased after she had given birth

58
00:03:22.170 --> 00:03:24.150
to a healthy baby boy like Peter.

59
00:03:30.610 --> 00:03:35.190
<v 0>In 16, 76, Sox fell ill after staying out in the cold winter air.</v>

60
00:03:35.430 --> 00:03:36.830
And he died 10 days later,

61
00:03:37.020 --> 00:03:40.740
this triggered the beginning of a power struck between the families of his two

62
00:03:40.910 --> 00:03:41.320
wives,

63
00:03:41.320 --> 00:03:46.140
the Miller Slosky and the kin Alex's oldest son Fior was

64
00:03:46.160 --> 00:03:49.780
his successor. His father had officially recognized him as his app,

65
00:03:49.850 --> 00:03:53.580
even so very few people thought it likely that he would actually become SAR

66
00:03:53.581 --> 00:03:57.900
since nobody expected the feeble Fior to outlive his father. And he had,

67
00:03:58.200 --> 00:04:00.970
it happens on June the 18th, 1676,

68
00:04:01.030 --> 00:04:05.810
the sickly 15 year old was crowned Theodore III Newar of Russia. Allegedly.

69
00:04:05.830 --> 00:04:09.730
He had to be carried during his coronation because his legs were so swollen that

70
00:04:09.731 --> 00:04:13.450
he couldn't walk. At first, there was no out hostility between the two families,

71
00:04:13.650 --> 00:04:14.211
Theodore,

72
00:04:14.211 --> 00:04:17.570
especially never displayed any ill will towards his half brother or his

73
00:04:17.571 --> 00:04:18.080
stepmother.

74
00:04:18.080 --> 00:04:21.960
It's also worth mentioning that the Norish and still had a notable ally in

75
00:04:22.440 --> 00:04:22.880
Artman.

76
00:04:22.880 --> 00:04:27.360
Mattia the statesman who served as Natalia's foster father and close advisor to

77
00:04:27.560 --> 00:04:29.760
Sarah, Alexis. He wanted Peter to take the throne,

78
00:04:29.761 --> 00:04:32.600
even though he was just four years old at the time of his father's death,

79
00:04:32.740 --> 00:04:34.640
he failed to convince the other nobleman though.

80
00:04:34.660 --> 00:04:36.400
And for his attempted interference,

81
00:04:36.500 --> 00:04:39.280
he was EXR from Moscow to a remote part of the kingdom.

82
00:04:39.580 --> 00:04:42.510
The relationship between in the two families took a drastic turn,

83
00:04:42.610 --> 00:04:45.070
six years later when feared or died without an app,

84
00:04:45.071 --> 00:04:48.430
technically his other brother Ivan was next in line to the throne,

85
00:04:48.490 --> 00:04:52.670
but his physical and mental disabilities proved to be a great concern to the

86
00:04:52.671 --> 00:04:56.190
Russian Nobles. Okay. The boy in 1682,

87
00:04:56.191 --> 00:05:00.430
they held a special assembly called a Douma and selected 10 year old Peter as

88
00:05:00.431 --> 00:05:04.300
feared or so accessor with his mother Naya acting as his Regent.

89
00:05:04.640 --> 00:05:08.140
One of her first actions was to bring Matt back to Moscow,

90
00:05:08.280 --> 00:05:09.580
to serve as their advisor.

91
00:05:16.260 --> 00:05:19.900
This arrangement did not sit well with the Miller Slosky family who still wanted

92
00:05:20.010 --> 00:05:23.570
Ivan to rule a saw with someone else acting as his Regents.

93
00:05:23.571 --> 00:05:25.450
They managed to get the Russian military core,

94
00:05:25.510 --> 00:05:30.290
the STRs on their side and lead the Moscow uprising of 1682 in may

95
00:05:30.610 --> 00:05:33.930
R erupted on the streets of Moscow with many Norkin allies,

96
00:05:33.931 --> 00:05:38.010
branded as traders emit hearsay that SAR Theodor may have been poisoned.

97
00:05:38.410 --> 00:05:42.600
The Remus grew even greater to a point where there was talk of an Eskin

98
00:05:42.601 --> 00:05:45.640
conspiracy to kill all the Royals. On the Milosky side.

99
00:05:45.900 --> 00:05:48.800
Of course the real conspiracy was against the Norkin.

100
00:05:48.980 --> 00:05:51.560
And two of the main perpetrators were Sophia Alexia,

101
00:05:51.720 --> 00:05:54.640
ner daughter of SA Alexis and sister Toor,

102
00:05:54.700 --> 00:05:59.000
and a statesman named VLE Galyon on may the 15th, the SQUI storms,

103
00:05:59.020 --> 00:06:02.680
the Kremlin looking to take down all of those who they perceived as traders.

104
00:06:02.790 --> 00:06:06.600
They had been convinced not only that the Norkin had killed Fido in order to

105
00:06:06.601 --> 00:06:09.400
take the throne, but that they also murdered his brother on,

106
00:06:09.560 --> 00:06:12.000
even as they poured into the square in front of the palace,

107
00:06:12.070 --> 00:06:15.200
they demanded the heads of the Norkin and Matt a,

108
00:06:15.310 --> 00:06:19.630
they were met with an UN expected site when Sarina Natalia emerged with Peter

109
00:06:19.810 --> 00:06:21.670
and prince Ivan alive and well,

110
00:06:22.270 --> 00:06:25.470
AUM on Mattia then showed himself and seemingly managed to talk down the angry

111
00:06:25.610 --> 00:06:29.230
mob, which was now full of doubts regarding their true purpose. For a while,

112
00:06:29.290 --> 00:06:31.510
it seems like the uprising might end peacefully.

113
00:06:31.570 --> 00:06:35.590
The rage of the crowd had been subdued and the TKI were ready to head home.

114
00:06:35.591 --> 00:06:36.230
However,

115
00:06:36.230 --> 00:06:40.900
a commander into Michael do Giov thought that this would be the perfect time to

116
00:06:40.901 --> 00:06:44.620
enact some strong military discipline and to began berating the man for their

117
00:06:44.621 --> 00:06:48.460
actions to William Marley. They did not respond well to this. In fact,

118
00:06:48.461 --> 00:06:50.220
their anger came back in full force.

119
00:06:50.500 --> 00:06:54.300
A group of STR Ky picked up the commander and threw him onto the Pikes of their

120
00:06:54.301 --> 00:06:56.660
comrades, who then proceeded to cut him into pieces.

121
00:06:56.930 --> 00:07:00.970
They then did at the same thing to Mattia who was also taken and executed right

122
00:07:00.971 --> 00:07:02.130
in front of 10 year old, Peter,

123
00:07:02.390 --> 00:07:05.850
the enraged soldiers rushed through the palace and went from room to room,

124
00:07:05.851 --> 00:07:10.570
looking for more boy and kins to execute. They killed one of Natalia's brothers,

125
00:07:10.571 --> 00:07:13.050
as well as several other statesmen. When they got tired,

126
00:07:13.160 --> 00:07:17.450
they sealed the escapes, put guards on the Kremlin and went home. The next day,

127
00:07:17.470 --> 00:07:20.440
the Austral returns to continu ferocious hunt.

128
00:07:20.580 --> 00:07:24.880
The main target they wanted was Ivan. Norkin another one of Natalia's brothers,

129
00:07:24.881 --> 00:07:28.120
who they believed to be the masterminds behind the alleged conspiracy.

130
00:07:28.420 --> 00:07:29.190
On the third day,

131
00:07:29.190 --> 00:07:32.920
they gave an ultimatum that if the Royal family did not give up Ivan,

132
00:07:32.990 --> 00:07:36.280
they will kill everyone inside the palace faced with little choice.

133
00:07:36.310 --> 00:07:40.910
They surrendered Ivan to the BEO where he also suffered and agonizing and

134
00:07:40.911 --> 00:07:44.070
gruesome death. Finally, after their thirst for blood was satiated.

135
00:07:44.210 --> 00:07:48.510
The stge reached a settlement with the remaining by which unsurprisingly was

136
00:07:48.540 --> 00:07:50.150
greatly in the soldier's favor.

137
00:07:50.160 --> 00:07:54.150
Since the nobleman were in no position to negotiate the ske received bag,

138
00:07:54.350 --> 00:07:57.830
pay complete amnesty for their murders and even a Tramal column,

139
00:07:57.831 --> 00:08:00.140
which celebrated their D against the traders.

140
00:08:00.140 --> 00:08:04.500
Moreover Peter's half brother Ivan was installed as joint SAR with his sister,

141
00:08:04.760 --> 00:08:06.980
Sophia ruling as Regent for both of them,

142
00:08:07.120 --> 00:08:09.980
the two young rulers even had a special double throne made for them,

143
00:08:09.981 --> 00:08:13.020
which included a hole in the back where Sophia would sit and listen to

144
00:08:13.021 --> 00:08:16.540
dignitaries and other visitors. And they would tell the SARS how to respond.

145
00:08:16.840 --> 00:08:18.820
Now, just before we get into the rest of today's video,

146
00:08:18.980 --> 00:08:22.450

uh, let's get back to today's video.

163
00:09:19.790 --> 00:09:22.030
Sophia was now the defacto ruler of Russia,

164
00:09:22.210 --> 00:09:26.510
but her authority was contested almost immediately by one of her co-conspirators

165
00:09:26.690 --> 00:09:28.070
in the stri Atki uprising,

166
00:09:28.430 --> 00:09:32.950
a boy named Andrea Avi Kansky Kansky will did a lot of power because he had the

167
00:09:32.951 --> 00:09:34.230
loyalty of the STRs ski.

168
00:09:34.330 --> 00:09:37.340
As the boy kept pushing the boundaries of his influence.

169
00:09:37.520 --> 00:09:41.580
Sophia believed it would only be a matter of time before Kansky ambitions and

170
00:09:41.581 --> 00:09:44.740
arrogance drove him to attempt to seize complete power.

171
00:09:44.840 --> 00:09:48.020
Indeed it wasn't long before rumors of a planned co started swirling.

172
00:09:48.021 --> 00:09:51.620
So Sophia took the two SARS and fled Moscow to the roll summer residence.

173
00:09:51.621 --> 00:09:55.420
Fortunately for the SARS Kansky also managed to anger. A lot of the boars,

174
00:09:55.710 --> 00:09:59.290
he was easily found guilty of plotting to assassinate the raw family on

175
00:09:59.450 --> 00:10:01.010
September the 17th, 1682,

176
00:10:01.330 --> 00:10:05.210
Sophia even succeeded in Luing Kansky to our residents outside Moscow and

177
00:10:05.400 --> 00:10:07.250
outside the protection of STRs,

178
00:10:07.340 --> 00:10:11.410
where he was condemned death and beheaded on the spot alongside his son,

179
00:10:11.411 --> 00:10:14.490
whether the boy actually planned to kill the rolls or whether he was

180
00:10:14.491 --> 00:10:18.200
outmaneuvered by Sophia. We can't say with certainty, but one thing was clear.

181
00:10:18.560 --> 00:10:21.920
A Serena who was back in power, as far as Peter was concerned,

182
00:10:21.940 --> 00:10:24.640
he cared very little for his position. As saw while he was young,

183
00:10:24.900 --> 00:10:27.240
due to the events he witnessed during the uprising,

184
00:10:27.300 --> 00:10:30.400
he developed an extreme aversion to Moscow and its palace,

185
00:10:30.460 --> 00:10:32.560
and he preferred to spend his time in the countryside.

186
00:10:32.660 --> 00:10:34.440
He took an interest in sailing ship,

187
00:10:34.600 --> 00:10:38.710
building the military for passions with will influence not only as re as saw,

188
00:10:38.730 --> 00:10:42.150
but the development of the whole Russian embar during this time.

189
00:10:42.151 --> 00:10:45.790
Peter also married yo dox Lapino at the insistence of his mother.

190
00:10:46.060 --> 00:10:47.830
This was not a happy marriage though.

191
00:10:48.030 --> 00:10:50.110
Once Peter later forced his wife to enter a convent,

192
00:10:50.290 --> 00:10:52.550
his relationship with his son, Alex was even worse.

193
00:10:52.690 --> 00:10:56.030
And it's believed that at one point that the air plotted against his father

194
00:10:56.031 --> 00:10:59.860
looking to restore or the old ways this was something Peter could not abide.

195
00:10:59.861 --> 00:11:03.380
And he had Alexy and all of his acquaintances tortured banished.

196
00:11:03.400 --> 00:11:06.660
And in some cases executed Alexy himself died in 17,

197
00:11:06.820 --> 00:11:08.660
18 due to wounds from being whipped.

198
00:11:14.750 --> 00:11:16.740
We're getting ahead of ourselves though, at this time,

199
00:11:16.741 --> 00:11:19.970
Peter was still a boy and Sophia was still in power.

200
00:11:19.971 --> 00:11:24.210
Eventually she lost the support of many by after two failed military campaigns

201
00:11:24.211 --> 00:11:28.850
against the Crimean carnet influenced by her partner in crime and lover VLY

202
00:11:29.450 --> 00:11:31.570
Galyon, who was also an ARD fan of the west.

203
00:11:32.210 --> 00:11:36.290
Sophia did something a SAR never did before she joined a coalition of European

204
00:11:36.390 --> 00:11:39.800
powers in a war against autumn EMBA. And in exchange,

205
00:11:40.020 --> 00:11:42.400
she received Kiev from the kingdom of Poland.

206
00:11:42.560 --> 00:11:47.360
Sophia's main target was the crem tars VAs of the autumn EMBA who conducted

207
00:11:47.640 --> 00:11:49.720
frequent raids into Russian Lance. However,

208
00:11:50.020 --> 00:11:54.840
her forces in experience in large scale combat became evidence and Galzin

209
00:11:54.850 --> 00:11:57.160
especially proved INEP commanding an army.

210
00:11:57.270 --> 00:12:01.720
They launched a failed campaign in 16, 16, 87, where they not only lost battles,

211
00:12:01.820 --> 00:12:05.520
but were forced to retreat and give up settlements to the advancing tars.

212
00:12:05.720 --> 00:12:09.840
A second campaign in 1689 was also unsuccessful in the summer of

213
00:12:11.040 --> 00:12:11.281
16 89, 17 year old.

214
00:12:11.281 --> 00:12:15.630
Peter had the support of the boy and over through his half sister, Sophia,

215
00:12:15.690 --> 00:12:18.710
who was forced to enter convents and become a nun.

216
00:12:18.711 --> 00:12:21.630
Peter had no ill will towards his stepbrother, Ivan,

217
00:12:21.631 --> 00:12:23.870
who was allowed to stay yaws co ruler.

218
00:12:24.190 --> 00:12:27.670
Although this was purely in name only as Peter was still not of age.

219
00:12:27.910 --> 00:12:31.710
His mother attempted to serve as Regents, which she did until she died in 1694,

220
00:12:32.020 --> 00:12:33.420
Ivan died two year, years later,

221
00:12:33.820 --> 00:12:37.700
and the 24 year old Peter finally became the sole ruler of Russia.

222
00:12:44.000 --> 00:12:45.340
It took a long time to get here,

223
00:12:45.360 --> 00:12:49.260
but now Peter ruled unopposed and was free to enact his vision for a modern

224
00:12:49.261 --> 00:12:53.340
Russia. Based on the models of the Western European powers. He took on foreign,

225
00:12:53.560 --> 00:12:57.530
such as France, foreign Patrick Gordon serve his close advisors.

226
00:12:57.710 --> 00:13:00.770
He enacted sweeping reforms to reorganize the Russian military.

227
00:13:00.771 --> 00:13:04.010
He adopted Western dress as did his courtiers and officials.

228
00:13:04.230 --> 00:13:07.970
He instituted the Julian calendar moving the celebration of new year to January.

229
00:13:08.110 --> 00:13:12.010
The first, he also began marrying off his relatives to other European royalty,

230
00:13:12.130 --> 00:13:14.600
a practice which had been shunned by his assesses.

231
00:13:14.601 --> 00:13:17.680
And he also made a habit of sending young nobleman to study abroad,

232
00:13:17.740 --> 00:13:20.720
to receive a more worldly education in one of his more,

233
00:13:20.970 --> 00:13:22.720
let's say unconventional moments,

234
00:13:22.850 --> 00:13:27.680
Peter even enacted a beard tax to encourage Russians to cut their beards because

235
00:13:27.820 --> 00:13:30.320
the clean shaven look was in Vogue. In Western Europe.

236
00:13:30.540 --> 00:13:35.350
The SAR introduced this new decree in quite dramatic fashion in six Dean 98

237
00:13:35.351 --> 00:13:36.750
during a reception in his honor,

238
00:13:36.800 --> 00:13:40.310
Peter stunned his guests by coming down to greet them clean shaven,

239
00:13:40.390 --> 00:13:41.990
sporting just mustache.

240
00:13:42.130 --> 00:13:45.830
He then took out a razor and proceeded to go around from one male guest to

241
00:13:45.831 --> 00:13:49.230
another cutting off their beards with his own hands. At first,

242
00:13:49.231 --> 00:13:52.030
nobody was safe from the razor except for priests and peasants.

243
00:13:52.031 --> 00:13:54.910
Everybody else would've been shaved on the spot by police officials.

244
00:13:55.360 --> 00:13:57.780
If they were caught harboring illegal facial hat.

245
00:13:57.970 --> 00:14:00.220
Evidently though Peter relaxed on this stance,

246
00:14:00.540 --> 00:14:03.780
some wart introduced the beer tax, which was not only more practical,

247
00:14:03.840 --> 00:14:07.060
but also beneficial to his Coffs in 1697,

248
00:14:07.061 --> 00:14:11.100
Peter organized a year long diplomatic mission known as the grand embassy.

249
00:14:11.120 --> 00:14:15.180
He visited multiple countries in Western Europe looking to secure various deals

250
00:14:15.260 --> 00:14:18.170
and serve Evers. He managed to obtain foreign specialists,

251
00:14:18.270 --> 00:14:19.410
new technology and weapons,

252
00:14:19.630 --> 00:14:23.690
but failed in his ultimate goal of finding allies for his ongoing conflict.

253
00:14:23.800 --> 00:14:24.850
With the Ottoman empire.

254
00:14:24.990 --> 00:14:28.610
It was bad timing as the west had its own problem to deal with Charles II.

255
00:14:28.790 --> 00:14:32.210
The inbred sickly king of Spain was in poor health and had no as,

256
00:14:32.270 --> 00:14:36.440
and Europe was preparing for the war of succession that his death trigger.

257
00:14:36.650 --> 00:14:40.240
Peter spent most of his time in the Netherlands and Englands which at the time

258
00:14:40.241 --> 00:14:43.520
were both ruled by William II, AKA William of orange.

259
00:14:43.780 --> 00:14:47.360
He usually went incognito one, the pseudonym Peter Meha of,

260
00:14:47.680 --> 00:14:49.080
but the fact that he was six foot,

261
00:14:49.081 --> 00:14:52.400
eight inches tall meant that he seldom managed to remain anonymous.

262
00:14:52.620 --> 00:14:56.720
He also enjoyed quite a few notorious drinking sessions and after leaving

263
00:14:56.721 --> 00:14:57.260
London,

264
00:14:57.260 --> 00:15:01.680
the law to provided him with accommodations complains that Peter and his revenue

265
00:15:01.810 --> 00:15:05.480
completely trashed the house where they were staying thus setting the bar pretty

266
00:15:05.510 --> 00:15:08.520
high for the rock stars that would follow in his footsteps.

267
00:15:08.630 --> 00:15:13.150
Some 200 years later also found a drinking buddy in Perrin Osborne.

268
00:15:13.170 --> 00:15:15.910
The marque of Carma, a Marine architect,

269
00:15:15.980 --> 00:15:19.590
Osborne earns the SARS friendship when he designed a yacht for him as a gift

270
00:15:19.591 --> 00:15:20.424
from king William,

271
00:15:20.610 --> 00:15:24.430
the two reportedly drank so frequently at one pub in London that the landlord

272
00:15:24.700 --> 00:15:28.270
renamed it, the SAR of musky, the pub is gone today,

273
00:15:28.290 --> 00:15:32.860
but nearby musky street still exists as reminder of Peter's party days in

274
00:15:32.861 --> 00:15:33.540
London,

275
00:15:33.540 --> 00:15:37.660
this all had to end the grand embassy early because back home he faced another

276
00:15:38.300 --> 00:15:41.500
Trotsky uprising in July of 1698. This one, however,

277
00:15:41.690 --> 00:15:43.380
went decidedly in his favor.

278
00:15:43.560 --> 00:15:46.500
The rebellion was crushed even before Peter return to Russia,

279
00:15:47.140 --> 00:15:49.980
although dozens were executed and many more sent into Axel,

280
00:15:50.050 --> 00:15:53.090
this was not good enough for this saw when he returned to Moscow,

281
00:15:53.091 --> 00:15:57.610
he demanded a major investigation to discover all the accomplices after a lot of

282
00:15:57.611 --> 00:15:58.850
torture and confessions.

283
00:15:58.960 --> 00:16:03.610
Most of them probably false well over 1000 Strake were executed and

284
00:16:03.611 --> 00:16:07.650
hundreds more send in to AAL regimens that had nothing to do with the rebellion

285
00:16:07.651 --> 00:16:11.450
were disbanded while all the Strout ski and their family were banished from

286
00:16:11.470 --> 00:16:12.240
Moscow.

287
00:16:12.240 --> 00:16:16.240
Many believed that this new uprising simply gave Peter a pretext to enact his

288
00:16:16.241 --> 00:16:20.680
long awaited revenge on the S STRs ski for their previous RT that terrorized him

289
00:16:20.681 --> 00:16:22.840
as a child and led to the death of his family.

290
00:16:29.100 --> 00:16:30.280
In case it wasn't clear yet.

291
00:16:30.281 --> 00:16:34.830
Peter was a big fan of ships and his Raiders ambition was to turn Russia into

292
00:16:34.831 --> 00:16:36.430
one of Europe's maritime powers.

293
00:16:36.450 --> 00:16:39.630
He learned a lot about ship building during his grand embassy and obtains.

294
00:16:39.631 --> 00:16:44.030
The knowledge manpower and resources needed to construct watercrafts as good as

295
00:16:44.031 --> 00:16:46.990
those in Western Europe. But in order to fulfill his goal,

296
00:16:47.390 --> 00:16:50.550
there was one thing he needed access to water after all,

297
00:16:50.551 --> 00:16:53.420
you can't really have a Navy on lands. And, and at that time,

298
00:16:53.421 --> 00:16:56.860
Russia only had access to the north sea via the port at Aang gels.

299
00:16:57.060 --> 00:16:58.700
And that was simply not good enough.

300
00:16:58.850 --> 00:17:02.740
This necessity would more or less shape Peter's foreign policies during his

301
00:17:02.760 --> 00:17:03.593
entire reign.

302
00:17:03.600 --> 00:17:07.340
Russia was still at war with the Ottoman empire from the time Sophia launched

303
00:17:07.341 --> 00:17:10.260
her ill fated campaigns in crimee without, in mind,

304
00:17:10.440 --> 00:17:12.460
in 1695 and 1696,

305
00:17:12.461 --> 00:17:17.330
Peter renewed against the Turks with two new military campaigns focused

306
00:17:17.350 --> 00:17:19.490
on capturing the fortres of Azo.

307
00:17:19.500 --> 00:17:23.770
Ultimately the Russians were successful scoring not only an important victory

308
00:17:23.771 --> 00:17:24.604
against their enemy,

309
00:17:24.790 --> 00:17:27.890
but also gaining access to the sea of Azo and the black sea.

310
00:17:27.990 --> 00:17:32.210
The war ended in 1699 with the signing of the treaty of Carli.

311
00:17:32.680 --> 00:17:34.800
Peter's next target was the BTIC sea,

312
00:17:34.801 --> 00:17:38.560
which back then was almost entirely under the control of the Swedish. Em,

313
00:17:38.680 --> 00:17:41.240
empire led by 18 year old king, Charles the 12th,

314
00:17:41.310 --> 00:17:45.840
therefore in 1700 Russia went to war in a conflict that would rage on for over

315
00:17:45.841 --> 00:17:46.680
21 years,

316
00:17:46.900 --> 00:17:50.800
but would ultimately lead to the birth of the Russian empire and secure its

317
00:17:50.920 --> 00:17:52.560
position as a new global power.

318
00:17:58.790 --> 00:18:02.240
This conflict became known as the great Northern war going into the fight.

319
00:18:02.241 --> 00:18:04.040
Peter formed an Alliance with Frederick,

320
00:18:04.180 --> 00:18:07.200
the fourth king of Denmark and Norway and Augustus II,

321
00:18:07.260 --> 00:18:09.830
the strong who ruled of the Commonwealth of Poland,

322
00:18:10.510 --> 00:18:13.150
Lithuania as well as the electorate of Sony over the years,

323
00:18:13.300 --> 00:18:16.670
many other nations would come in and out of the fight as the war engulfed,

324
00:18:16.671 --> 00:18:18.830
most of Northern central and Eastern Europe,

325
00:18:19.050 --> 00:18:22.990
it might be fair to say that Peter and his comrades in arms were hoping for a

326
00:18:22.991 --> 00:18:27.390
quick victory by overwhelming Sweden with a three pronged attack that did not

327
00:18:27.391 --> 00:18:31.660
happen as the first battle were all in Sweden's favor just a few months after it

328
00:18:31.820 --> 00:18:32.860
declared war Denmark,

329
00:18:32.880 --> 00:18:36.180
Norway had to call peace with the Swedish empire after being defeated,

330
00:18:36.860 --> 00:18:38.660
trave due to a previous treaty.

331
00:18:38.661 --> 00:18:42.260
Sweden had the maritime support of the United Kingdom and the Netherlands,

332
00:18:42.280 --> 00:18:45.300
as we mentioned, though, they were busy with the war of Spanish succession.

333
00:18:45.360 --> 00:18:47.620
So although they helped fight off the attackers,

334
00:18:47.650 --> 00:18:50.690
they would not assist Sweden in conquering Denmark.

335
00:18:51.090 --> 00:18:53.370
A similar situation occurred in Polands,

336
00:18:53.490 --> 00:18:55.330
although it took a bit longer king Charles,

337
00:18:55.530 --> 00:18:59.370
the 12th mounted a successful counter offensive and conquered Warsaw and crack

338
00:18:59.610 --> 00:19:03.810
out. The two sides signed. The treaty of Rin starts in 1706,

339
00:19:03.811 --> 00:19:07.530
where Augustus thei had to abdicate the throne recognized Stan SLAs.

340
00:19:07.650 --> 00:19:10.440
The first as the new Polish king and renounces Alliance with Russia,

341
00:19:10.680 --> 00:19:11.560
speaking of Russia,

342
00:19:11.570 --> 00:19:15.080
their first attempt gaining a foothold in the BTIC ended in disaster.

343
00:19:15.220 --> 00:19:16.560
The battle of Nava on November,

344
00:19:16.561 --> 00:19:19.960
the 30th 1700 concluded with a decisive Swedish victory,

345
00:19:19.961 --> 00:19:24.360
as they caused up to 8,000 Russian casualties while losing less than a 10th of

346
00:19:24.361 --> 00:19:28.560
that number. And they captured almost 200 artillery pieces because king Charles,

347
00:19:28.580 --> 00:19:31.470
the 12th elected to concentrate as their efforts on Poland.

348
00:19:31.560 --> 00:19:34.350
Peter had years to build up a new, modern,

349
00:19:34.450 --> 00:19:38.990
better trained and better equipped army in 1703. He founded St. Petersburg,

350
00:19:38.991 --> 00:19:43.430
which would serve as the new capital for his ZAPA in 1708 with Poland taking

351
00:19:43.431 --> 00:19:45.830
care of Charles redirected his attention to Russia.

352
00:19:46.270 --> 00:19:49.350
Although initially successful, he soon learned a very harsh lesson.

353
00:19:49.870 --> 00:19:53.340
One that other future founders would learn at their own cost.

354
00:19:53.880 --> 00:19:57.380
And that's the year don't invade Russia in winter. It didn't help that,

355
00:19:57.381 --> 00:20:01.300
that season later dubbed the great frost happened to be the coldest European

356
00:20:01.301 --> 00:20:06.260
winter of the past 500 years after suffering heavy losses to the colds,

357
00:20:06.380 --> 00:20:11.020
as well as starvation Charles routed his forces to Russian owned Ukraine

358
00:20:11.460 --> 00:20:15.410
coal in the battle of Poltava on July the eighth, 1709.

359
00:20:15.640 --> 00:20:18.530
This was a huge victory for Peter. Consequently,

360
00:20:18.531 --> 00:20:20.730
Charles had to retreat into the Ottoman empire,

361
00:20:20.731 --> 00:20:24.570
which was his ally and Poland and Denmark canceled their peace treaties and

362
00:20:24.571 --> 00:20:27.410
joined the war. Again. The tide turns in Peter's favor,

363
00:20:27.590 --> 00:20:28.890
but he got a bit to cocky.

364
00:20:28.990 --> 00:20:33.480
He demanded the Ottoman Salton surrender Charles to when the latter refused

365
00:20:33.481 --> 00:20:38.240
Peter invaded and was soundly defeated during the PR river campaign between 17,

366
00:20:38.300 --> 00:20:42.640
10, and 1711. He had to make multiple concessions including giving back as of,

367
00:20:42.660 --> 00:20:43.840
but fortunately for him,

368
00:20:43.860 --> 00:20:47.640
the Salton wasn't interested in a protracted war and he eventually kicked

369
00:20:47.641 --> 00:20:51.920
Charles out of his empire in 1714, the conflict lasted for another seven years.

370
00:20:52.020 --> 00:20:54.400
Sweden still had occasional military victories,

371
00:20:54.460 --> 00:20:58.480
but it never regained the dominant position it had had at the outset of the war.

372
00:20:58.530 --> 00:21:02.040
Other nations like PR and Hanover smelled the blood in the water and also

373
00:21:02.360 --> 00:21:05.400
declared war on the Swedish empire. On November the 30th 17,

374
00:21:05.680 --> 00:21:09.390
18 Charles wealth was killed by a bullet to the side of the head during the

375
00:21:09.510 --> 00:21:13.270
siege of Fredrickton. The great Northern war ended on September the 10th,

376
00:21:14.430 --> 00:21:16.550
1721 with the treaty of NESAD Russia,

377
00:21:17.070 --> 00:21:21.590
Estonia Levonia part of Finlands and now it had its much covered

378
00:21:21.840 --> 00:21:22.950
entry into the Baltic.

379
00:21:22.980 --> 00:21:26.150
This represented an important shift in the power balance of Europe.

380
00:21:26.410 --> 00:21:30.220
The Swedish and bar was gone and the Russian empire had risen

381
00:21:36.410 --> 00:21:40.700
Peter's later years were mostly marked by continued reform inside his new em

382
00:21:40.780 --> 00:21:44.780
empire. However, when the S Saed dynasty began crumbling in modern day, Iran,

383
00:21:44.910 --> 00:21:48.050
Peter couldn't resist gaining entry to the CASP EMC.

384
00:21:48.270 --> 00:21:51.130
He launched the Russia Persian war in 1722,

385
00:21:51.140 --> 00:21:54.890
which ended a year later with a victory for Russia shortly after the war,

386
00:21:54.891 --> 00:21:57.810
Peter fell with bladder problems. He died on February the eighth,

387
00:21:58.130 --> 00:22:02.490
1725 and was buried at some Peter and Paul's cathedral in St. Petersburg.

388
00:22:02.850 --> 00:22:04.650
He was succeeded by his second wife, Catherine,

389
00:22:04.710 --> 00:22:07.250
the first who became the first woman to rule Imperial Russia,

390
00:22:07.280 --> 00:22:11.240
setting age for future rulers, such as Katherine, the great who by the way,

391
00:22:11.500 --> 00:22:13.400
