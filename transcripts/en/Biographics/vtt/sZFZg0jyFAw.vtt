6
00:00:19.690 --> 00:00:22.030
We're all familiar mummies. Whenever we say the word,

7
00:00:22.031 --> 00:00:26.350
we typically think of the ones from ancient DJ brat in linen and placed in Sarov

8
00:00:26.670 --> 00:00:30.830
guy. We find them fascinating because they represent a distinctive aspect of an

9
00:00:30.831 --> 00:00:35.470
ancient civilization, but the Egyptians didn't have a monopoly on mummies. No,

10
00:00:35.490 --> 00:00:36.750
in fact, in recent decades,

11
00:00:37.190 --> 00:00:40.870
scientists have been growing increasingly enthusiastic over a different kind of

12
00:00:41.560 --> 00:00:42.393
the bog bodies.

13
00:00:42.610 --> 00:00:45.860
What are they well like their name implies they're human bodies that have been

14
00:00:45.861 --> 00:00:49.660
found in Pete bogs. These environments have a unique set of characteristics,

15
00:00:49.661 --> 00:00:53.540
which is pretty amazing at preserving organic material for hundreds or even

16
00:00:53.980 --> 00:00:54.813
thousands of years,

17
00:00:54.900 --> 00:00:59.260
cadavers that have simply been thrown in the bog had been naturally mummified

18
00:00:59.320 --> 00:01:03.290
and remained an excellent condition for aging is until they were finally dug out

19
00:01:03.291 --> 00:01:04.610
again or more than one occasion.

20
00:01:04.790 --> 00:01:07.650
<v 1>One of these bog bodies was initially treated as a recent death,</v>

21
00:01:07.651 --> 00:01:11.330
perhaps even a murder victim because it looks like it only died a short while

22
00:01:11.470 --> 00:01:11.830
ago.

23
00:01:11.830 --> 00:01:16.210
<v 0>The most famous bog body of all is arguably the to man and the good reason he</v>

24
00:01:16.211 --> 00:01:20.450
has been called the perfect corpse by various scholars because his head is so

25
00:01:20.500 --> 00:01:23.800
remarkably well preserve even by the standards of bog bodies,

26
00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:26.440
people from the silk bog museum in Denmark,

27
00:01:26.441 --> 00:01:29.960
where the tall man is on permanent display have reported visitors,

28
00:01:29.961 --> 00:01:32.440
being a struck others, breaking down in tears,

29
00:01:32.500 --> 00:01:35.920
and really even fainting when looking into the face of this man who appears to

30
00:01:35.921 --> 00:01:38.920
have died peacefully just a few years ago, but in reality,

31
00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:41.480
he's been dead for well over 2000 years,

32
00:01:41.780 --> 00:01:45.030
the tall man in a completely unique glimpse into our ancient past.

33
00:01:45.170 --> 00:01:47.430
And today we're gonna bring you a story.

34
00:01:53.870 --> 00:01:55.310
It was a Monday morning on may the eighth,

35
00:01:55.630 --> 00:01:58.030
1950 in the town of silk war in Denmark.

36
00:01:58.031 --> 00:02:01.150
And the police received a distressing message about a potential murder victim

37
00:02:01.460 --> 00:02:06.220
that may have been killed and then dump to nearby Pete bog at some town I can't

38
00:02:06.221 --> 00:02:08.460
possibly pronounce about 10 kilometers away.

39
00:02:08.530 --> 00:02:11.460
This message came from two brothers who were professional,

40
00:02:11.461 --> 00:02:16.140
Pete cutters named Vigo and Emma Hogart alongside Vi's wife, Greece,

41
00:02:16.240 --> 00:02:17.420
and our stepson John.

42
00:02:17.450 --> 00:02:21.020
They had spent the weekend deep in the bog on Saturday may the sixth Greece was

43
00:02:21.021 --> 00:02:23.500
the first to notice something strange buried in the Pete. They done,

44
00:02:23.610 --> 00:02:26.570
I get outta it only enough to realize that it was the body of a human.

45
00:02:26.670 --> 00:02:29.730
It had been mummified and the P and exceptionally well preserved.

46
00:02:29.731 --> 00:02:32.490
So it was not surprising that the family initially thought they had stumbled

47
00:02:32.491 --> 00:02:34.130
onto the victim of a crime. At the time,

48
00:02:34.131 --> 00:02:36.290
there was a boy in Copenhagen who had gone missing.

49
00:02:36.390 --> 00:02:39.650
So the Pete cutters fears that it may have been his remains that they have

50
00:02:39.850 --> 00:02:42.490
discovered the body was still covered in too much peat to distinguish any

51
00:02:42.491 --> 00:02:46.080
notable features, but they could tell that it had a rope around its neck.

52
00:02:46.480 --> 00:02:48.000
On Monday. Police arrived on the scene.

53
00:02:48.030 --> 00:02:51.320
They found out from the Hodge guards that the body had been buried about 60

54
00:02:51.321 --> 00:02:55.000
meters away from solid ground in a location that showed no signs of recent

55
00:02:55.030 --> 00:02:55.540
digging.

56
00:02:55.540 --> 00:02:58.480
<v 1>Add to that the fact that it was buried beneath two and a half meters of peace</v>

57
00:02:58.500 --> 00:03:02.160
and the authority suspected that the body might not have been as fresh as the

58
00:03:02.161 --> 00:03:04.200
family initially suspected. And in fact,

59
00:03:04.201 --> 00:03:07.680
it might be a matter for the super bowl museum rather than the police people

60
00:03:07.681 --> 00:03:10.440
from the museum showed up the next day and confirmed their suspicions.

61
00:03:10.720 --> 00:03:11.840
<v 0>They had a bog body on their hands,</v>

62
00:03:11.860 --> 00:03:15.560
and there was no way of telling how old it truly was without analyzing it in the

63
00:03:15.580 --> 00:03:19.350
lab. This was due to the unique natural environment found in Pete box.

64
00:03:19.650 --> 00:03:23.750
The main culprits is Pete MOS, the plants that is ubiquitous in such areas.

65
00:03:23.930 --> 00:03:25.830
It creates something called bog acid,

66
00:03:25.920 --> 00:03:28.030
which can impede the development of bacteria.

67
00:03:28.220 --> 00:03:32.710
This plus the anaerobic or low oxygen environment creates an ideal scenario

68
00:03:32.760 --> 00:03:34.830
where organic material barely decompose.

69
00:03:35.210 --> 00:03:39.300
So bodies stay remarkably well preserved for countless years after they eye,

70
00:03:39.360 --> 00:03:40.940
the local press was all over the news,

71
00:03:41.040 --> 00:03:45.060
but it needed a caption name for the unidentified body. Some of them called it,

72
00:03:45.160 --> 00:03:46.300
the man from bog Villa,

73
00:03:46.540 --> 00:03:49.740
although at the time it was still not certain yet that the body belonged to a

74
00:03:49.741 --> 00:03:53.460
man or a woman the remains were found at that town that I names that doesn't

75
00:03:53.461 --> 00:03:55.580
exactly roll off the tongue. So instead archeologists,

76
00:03:56.060 --> 00:04:00.490
PV GL decided to name the body after the small nearby village where the whole

77
00:04:00.850 --> 00:04:04.490
guards came from. And well, so the world was introduced to the, to man

78
00:04:10.670 --> 00:04:14.090
At the time of the discovery, bog bodies were not a new concept. In fact,

79
00:04:14.130 --> 00:04:17.850
a different body known as E woman had been found a short distance from the to

80
00:04:17.910 --> 00:04:19.050
man just 12 years prior,

81
00:04:19.051 --> 00:04:22.320
plenty of others had been discovered throughout Europe and Denmark in particular

82
00:04:22.560 --> 00:04:24.560
proved to be a rich resource of such anomalies.

83
00:04:24.620 --> 00:04:28.200
But the natural preservation of these remains turned out to be the easy part

84
00:04:28.201 --> 00:04:32.240
because then came the difficult task of actually removing the to man from the

85
00:04:32.720 --> 00:04:35.520
bogs, taking it to a laboratory or without completely destroying it,

86
00:04:35.630 --> 00:04:37.040
just like the mummies of Egypt,

87
00:04:37.041 --> 00:04:40.710
great care was needed when removing these bodies from the environment they have

88
00:04:40.870 --> 00:04:41.671
done for thousands of years,

89
00:04:41.671 --> 00:04:45.430
otherwise exposure to regular atmospheric conditions could have had an immediate

90
00:04:45.570 --> 00:04:48.590
and irreversible damaging effect on the remains up until then.

91
00:04:48.591 --> 00:04:51.630
This hadn't really been done successfully on a bog body before,

92
00:04:51.910 --> 00:04:55.550
at least not on one that was tagged and in such good condition as the top man,

93
00:04:55.600 --> 00:04:59.710
there was one notable exception and she was called the Harold scare.

94
00:05:00.070 --> 00:05:02.060
Women found all the way back in 1835.

95
00:05:02.061 --> 00:05:05.860
This body of a woman was so well preserved that it still contained every organ.

96
00:05:06.040 --> 00:05:06.560
For some reason,

97
00:05:06.560 --> 00:05:09.980
people at the time believed that the body must belong to queen Gunhill of

98
00:05:09.981 --> 00:05:13.940
Norway. An important figure in the Icelandic sagas, therefore king Frederick,

99
00:05:14.120 --> 00:05:17.620
the sick ordered that she be given an exhumation worthy of a Royal Sarah remains

100
00:05:17.621 --> 00:05:21.020
were carefully removed, intact and placed inside a fancy coffin.

101
00:05:21.260 --> 00:05:22.490
Although the unintentional,

102
00:05:22.730 --> 00:05:25.850
this had the fortuitous side effect of preserving the body in good condition.

103
00:05:25.950 --> 00:05:28.210
She wasn't queen Gunhill by the way. In fact,

104
00:05:28.211 --> 00:05:32.090
she just came from the iron age and lived about 1,500 years earlier than the

105
00:05:32.091 --> 00:05:35.290
queen, but her remains had been maintained well enough that even in the year,

106
00:05:35.310 --> 00:05:38.210
2000, when scientists reexamined her with new technology,

107
00:05:38.240 --> 00:05:41.810
they could still tell what food was in her stomach. It was black reason,

108
00:05:42.710 --> 00:05:45.520
unha mil, in case you were wondering. Anyway,

109
00:05:45.540 --> 00:05:49.280
the point is that Danish authorities wanted to be extra careful with removing

110
00:05:49.281 --> 00:05:51.240
the tall man from his slumber in the bog,

111
00:05:51.241 --> 00:05:55.600
because specimens like him did not come along that often his head in particular

112
00:05:55.740 --> 00:05:58.720
was in a state of preservation, unlike anything seen before or after.

113
00:05:58.820 --> 00:06:00.360
For that matter. Other examples,

114
00:06:00.361 --> 00:06:04.080
even the Howard scare women still looked like mummies. The tall man,

115
00:06:04.081 --> 00:06:06.560
however did not. His nose still retained its shape.

116
00:06:06.580 --> 00:06:08.680
His eyelids had not sunk it into the sockets.

117
00:06:08.681 --> 00:06:12.240
You could still see the furrows on his brow. You could still see his hair.

118
00:06:12.480 --> 00:06:16.280
And even the faintest traces of beards double the transportation of the body was

119
00:06:16.850 --> 00:06:18.350
by people from the silk board museum.

120
00:06:18.700 --> 00:06:21.710
Plus the two brothers who found it as well as a few policemen.

121
00:06:21.810 --> 00:06:25.310
The first thing they did was dig around the remains. So the to man was left,

122
00:06:25.390 --> 00:06:27.990
elevated on a peak platform. They then placed the box.

123
00:06:28.010 --> 00:06:31.390
He would be carried in around him, but without the top or the bottom afterwards,

124
00:06:31.391 --> 00:06:35.110
they started inserting planks underneath the box one by one to make the bottom.

125
00:06:35.210 --> 00:06:38.060
And finally they placed the lid on this way.

126
00:06:38.061 --> 00:06:41.980
They had the tall man in a box ready to be transported to the national museum of

127
00:06:42.100 --> 00:06:45.220
Denmark in Copenhagen, but nobody had actually touched him.

128
00:06:45.320 --> 00:06:49.300
And he was still encased in the same Pete that he had been for countless ages.

129
00:06:49.600 --> 00:06:52.420
Now, before we continue with today's video, let me thank today's sponsor.

just use biographics of checkout and let's get back to today's video

152
00:08:08.440 --> 00:08:09.780
At the museum in Copenhagen,

153
00:08:09.781 --> 00:08:13.780
the examination of the bog body began as scientists laboriously removed the Pete

154
00:08:13.880 --> 00:08:16.460
bit by bit. So as not to cause any damage, the remains,

155
00:08:16.461 --> 00:08:20.010
eventually they were able to get a full picture of what the to man actually

156
00:08:20.250 --> 00:08:20.550
looked like.

157
00:08:20.550 --> 00:08:23.970
The first thing to notice was that the body was not as well preserved as the

158
00:08:23.971 --> 00:08:26.290
head it a trunk, but this was to be expected.

159
00:08:26.430 --> 00:08:29.650
The left side in particular was partially decomposed because it was the side

160
00:08:29.651 --> 00:08:32.290
that faced upwards in the bog. As the body sat in the fetal position,

161
00:08:32.550 --> 00:08:34.770
the arms and hands were almost completely skeletonized.

162
00:08:34.790 --> 00:08:36.530
The right side of the face fed much better.

163
00:08:36.670 --> 00:08:39.890
And even the skin remained intacted for the most part, the arm man,

164
00:08:40.560 --> 00:08:42.160
add a appointed leather cap on his head.

165
00:08:42.440 --> 00:08:44.640
It had been made from eight separate pieces of sheep skin,

166
00:08:44.641 --> 00:08:47.400
which were sewn together. And the first side had been turned inwards.

167
00:08:47.410 --> 00:08:49.440
There were also two leather straps on the sides,

168
00:08:49.441 --> 00:08:52.920
which were tied together under the chin to keep the hat in place underneath his

169
00:08:53.080 --> 00:08:55.880
cap. The taller man had short air, a few centimeters in length.

170
00:08:55.980 --> 00:08:57.880
It was red as was his beard stub,

171
00:08:58.140 --> 00:09:01.520
but this coloration was due to the bog water and not his natural hair color.

172
00:09:01.650 --> 00:09:04.800
Other than his cap, the tall man was naked, which was odd.

173
00:09:04.801 --> 00:09:08.440
Since most other bog bodies had been found either wearing clothes or having

174
00:09:08.441 --> 00:09:10.440
their clothes placed on top or next to them,

175
00:09:10.441 --> 00:09:13.160
there are a few possible explanations for this one, one,

176
00:09:13.180 --> 00:09:15.190
he was thrown in the bog, it two,

177
00:09:15.250 --> 00:09:18.950
his clothes had been placed next to him and over millennia due to Pete digging

178
00:09:19.110 --> 00:09:22.550
on some of the reason they had drifted away and become lost. Three,

179
00:09:22.650 --> 00:09:25.670
the most likely scenario was that clothes simply rotted away.

180
00:09:25.810 --> 00:09:29.230
He might have been wearing only a simple TNIC made out of vegetable fibers,

181
00:09:29.231 --> 00:09:31.990
which would not have survived in the acidic environment of the box.

182
00:09:32.170 --> 00:09:35.260
The idea is reinforced by the fact that the, to man did they,

183
00:09:35.261 --> 00:09:37.460
leather belts made of oxide tied around his waist.

184
00:09:37.520 --> 00:09:39.740
It seems unlikely that someone would've stripped him naked,

185
00:09:39.880 --> 00:09:44.140
but left his belt on. Lastly, there was also the rope tied around his neck.

186
00:09:44.200 --> 00:09:46.220
It doesn't really count as clothing or accessories.

187
00:09:46.540 --> 00:09:50.100
It more likely it was the murder weapon, but the cap, the belts and the rope,

188
00:09:50.300 --> 00:09:52.340
but the only items that were found with the, to man

189
00:09:58.830 --> 00:10:02.610
By examining the body scientists were able to determine the age of the to man

190
00:10:02.611 --> 00:10:03.131
when he died.

191
00:10:03.131 --> 00:10:06.770
Mainly this was established by analyzing his teeth as well as other telltale

192
00:10:06.771 --> 00:10:07.091
signs,

193
00:10:07.091 --> 00:10:10.930
such as the presence of adhesions on the skull and Coxy and arthritis of the

194
00:10:10.931 --> 00:10:11.371
sternum,

195
00:10:11.371 --> 00:10:14.530
which showed that the to man had the early stages of cost a Citis today,

196
00:10:14.690 --> 00:10:16.520
those symptoms would suggest a person of 40,

197
00:10:16.700 --> 00:10:20.280
but that is in our modern world while the biological aging of the body would

198
00:10:20.520 --> 00:10:22.400
occur at faster rate a thousand years ago, therefore the,

199
00:10:22.520 --> 00:10:26.560
to man's age was revised a bit downward and estimated to be between 30 and 40

200
00:10:26.561 --> 00:10:27.920
years. At the time of his death,

201
00:10:28.140 --> 00:10:32.120
he measured 161 centimeters in height when he was excavated or five foot three,

202
00:10:32.180 --> 00:10:35.840
but he almost certainly lost few centimeters due to shrinkage during his time in

203
00:10:35.841 --> 00:10:36.201
the bog.

204
00:10:36.201 --> 00:10:39.750
So he would've been taller in real life and probably of average height for that

205
00:10:39.910 --> 00:10:40.250
era.

206
00:10:40.250 --> 00:10:44.190
X-rays revealed that the interior had been just about as well preserved as the

207
00:10:44.350 --> 00:10:46.110
exterior, all the organs were still there,

208
00:10:46.350 --> 00:10:49.590
although they had lost volume and had been flattened by the pressure inside the

209
00:10:49.710 --> 00:10:51.790
PE bog, the brain was intact, although it too,

210
00:10:51.910 --> 00:10:55.110
it shrunken due to loss of moisture. The vertebrae were unbroken,

211
00:10:55.230 --> 00:10:58.100
although all signs pointed to the, to and having been hanged.

212
00:10:58.101 --> 00:11:02.260
But this was parter to say with certainty due to advanced decalcification of the

213
00:11:02.261 --> 00:11:06.260
bones, scientists took special interest in the stomach and the large intestines,

214
00:11:06.261 --> 00:11:09.900
since it wasn't every day that they were able to directly analyze the diet of a

215
00:11:09.901 --> 00:11:10.661
prehistoric man,

216
00:11:10.661 --> 00:11:14.540
they managed to extract around 250 mills or eight and a half ounces of stomach

217
00:11:14.541 --> 00:11:17.220
content that constituted the to man's last meal.

218
00:11:17.570 --> 00:11:19.930
He consumed 12 to 24 hours before his death,

219
00:11:19.950 --> 00:11:23.530
as it had already made its way through the stomach and into the large intestine,

220
00:11:23.590 --> 00:11:27.810
it consisted of a, Poage made a barley FLA seed and seeds from various plants,

221
00:11:27.811 --> 00:11:31.850
such as knotweed, oat, and a her known as gold of pleasure decades later,

222
00:11:32.090 --> 00:11:35.210
one British archeologist tried recreating the meal for a BBC program and

223
00:11:35.211 --> 00:11:37.450
described it simply as disgusting.

224
00:11:38.620 --> 00:11:42.240
Now we arrive at the big question. How old is the to man?

225
00:11:42.350 --> 00:11:44.280
When the bog body was originally discovered,

226
00:11:44.281 --> 00:11:46.800
carbon dating was still a few years away from being developed.

227
00:11:46.801 --> 00:11:50.560
So scientists were unable to provide us with an accurate answer immediately by

228
00:11:50.561 --> 00:11:53.800
analyzing pollen samples taken from around the body. During the excavation,

229
00:11:54.020 --> 00:11:57.360
all they could really say was that the to man was younger than the stone age,

230
00:11:57.500 --> 00:11:59.720
but then carbon dating became a thing in several tests,

231
00:11:59.860 --> 00:12:04.240
all placed the bog body sometime between two thousand two hundred and two

232
00:12:04.240 --> 00:12:05.960
thousand four hundred years ago during the early iron age,

233
00:12:06.030 --> 00:12:08.880
also known as the pre Roman era of Northern Europe,

234
00:12:09.180 --> 00:12:12.240
as the technology kept improving, the dating became more accurate.

235
00:12:12.510 --> 00:12:14.710
The most recent deaths performed just a few years ago,

236
00:12:14.711 --> 00:12:18.830
narrowed the window down even further by using accelerator mass spectrometry on

237
00:12:18.831 --> 00:12:20.070
bone collagen samples,

238
00:12:20.071 --> 00:12:24.830
recovered from the Tolu man's femur and rib scientists stated the FEMA to 2,330

239
00:12:24.831 --> 00:12:27.910
years ago, plus, or minus 23 years in the rib, roughly the same,

240
00:12:28.180 --> 00:12:30.790
this plus all the previous data, but the birth of the Tolu man,

241
00:12:30.820 --> 00:12:34.420
somewhere between 405 and 380 BC,

242
00:12:40.840 --> 00:12:44.320
Or some scientists were busy conducting all kinds of high tech tests on the Tolu

243
00:12:44.321 --> 00:12:46.440
man's body to gather all the information they could.

244
00:12:46.530 --> 00:12:50.400
Other archeologists and forensic examiners wanted to study the case from a

245
00:12:50.401 --> 00:12:51.234
different perspective,

246
00:12:51.550 --> 00:12:54.430
that of a murder there is after all little doubt that the,

247
00:12:54.550 --> 00:12:55.670
to man died by hanging.

248
00:12:55.780 --> 00:12:59.590
Even if the cervical vertebrae were not broken contrary to popular belief,

249
00:12:59.591 --> 00:13:00.630
this doesn't always happen.

250
00:13:00.690 --> 00:13:04.350
It is the main difference between the long drop and the short drop methods of

251
00:13:04.351 --> 00:13:05.190
hanging the long drop,

252
00:13:05.191 --> 00:13:08.750
which was adopted much later in history was considered the more humane approach

253
00:13:08.890 --> 00:13:11.110
by dropping the condemned from a higher distance.

254
00:13:11.130 --> 00:13:14.270
The impact was greater and was designed to break the neck resulting in a,

255
00:13:14.420 --> 00:13:15.200
a faster death.

256
00:13:15.200 --> 00:13:18.420
The downside to this technique was that sometimes the impact was too great,

257
00:13:18.421 --> 00:13:22.260
either because the executioner misjudged the distance or because of the weight

258
00:13:22.261 --> 00:13:25.940
of the condemned and the drop caused the head to pop clean off the wild west

259
00:13:26.000 --> 00:13:29.220
outlaw black Jack catch him as an infamous example of this happening.

260
00:13:29.380 --> 00:13:33.140
Although in his case, the drop was too high and the rope was too rigid. Anyway,

261
00:13:33.410 --> 00:13:34.340
with the short drop,

262
00:13:34.620 --> 00:13:37.730
that was no care given to the height from which the condemned was dropped

263
00:13:37.731 --> 00:13:39.770
because they were going to be killed by suffocation.

264
00:13:39.990 --> 00:13:41.330
And that is what happened to the,

265
00:13:41.490 --> 00:13:44.250
to man scientists also found some distinction of the tongue,

266
00:13:44.251 --> 00:13:46.250
which is another sign consistent with suffocation.

267
00:13:46.690 --> 00:13:49.810
Multiple forensic specialists have examined the bog body and they all agreed

268
00:13:49.811 --> 00:13:50.850
that he was killed by hanging.

269
00:13:51.150 --> 00:13:54.770
But the other question of course is why they can only speculate on this point.

270
00:13:54.771 --> 00:13:57.960
Since we have little to no information about the people of Northern Europe from

271
00:13:57.961 --> 00:14:01.280
that time period, tacito the Roman historian gave us a good idea.

272
00:14:01.310 --> 00:14:05.320
When he wrote down accounts of Roman traders who ventured into the north and

273
00:14:05.321 --> 00:14:06.560
encountered the tribes there,

274
00:14:06.561 --> 00:14:09.960
he said that traders and renegades hang in those trees,

275
00:14:10.270 --> 00:14:11.600
cowards gutless,

276
00:14:11.700 --> 00:14:16.670
and on natural fornicators pressed down under a Wicker hurdle to the slimy

277
00:14:16.690 --> 00:14:18.230
mud of a bog. Sure.

278
00:14:18.340 --> 00:14:21.710
Tacitus wrote about 400 years after the to man was already dead,

279
00:14:21.850 --> 00:14:24.070
but his point was still valid. Could the,

280
00:14:24.071 --> 00:14:28.310
to man have been executed for being a criminal or a trait, it is possible,

281
00:14:28.630 --> 00:14:31.630
but scholars think it's unlikely due to the care that was shown to him after his

282
00:14:31.631 --> 00:14:32.950
death. They reckon that if the,

283
00:14:32.951 --> 00:14:36.310
to man was despised by the people who killed him, they would not have carried,

284
00:14:36.580 --> 00:14:39.620
meet him to the Pete bog afterwards and placed him in a sleeping feet or

285
00:14:39.780 --> 00:14:39.920
position.

286
00:14:39.920 --> 00:14:43.620
Not to mention that some things that they also closed his eyes and mouth to give

287
00:14:43.621 --> 00:14:44.700
him a more peaceful, demeanor.

288
00:14:44.960 --> 00:14:48.940
The alternative that most scholars consider most likely was that the,

289
00:14:49.140 --> 00:14:50.940
to man was some kind of human sacrifice.

290
00:14:51.030 --> 00:14:54.600
They don't know why he was chosen or what God he was sacrificed to.

291
00:14:54.740 --> 00:14:57.720
But the circumstantial evidence seems to point in that direction.

292
00:14:58.040 --> 00:14:59.960
The starters we know from Roman historians,

293
00:15:00.160 --> 00:15:03.200
the sacrificing humans was practiced by the various tribes of the north.

294
00:15:03.600 --> 00:15:06.800
Then there are also the circumstances of the, to mans bog, burials,

295
00:15:07.120 --> 00:15:09.360
starting with the fact that he was buried in the first place,

296
00:15:09.720 --> 00:15:13.390
the archeological syndicates that Northern European tribes during the iron H

297
00:15:13.410 --> 00:15:17.590
mainly practiced cremation while some people of high status were placed in

298
00:15:17.700 --> 00:15:21.910
caskets and buried alongside their possessions, neither of these applied to the,

299
00:15:22.110 --> 00:15:24.150
to man, which means that he belonged to a special group.

300
00:15:24.210 --> 00:15:26.350
And the only one we know of is human sacrifices.

301
00:15:26.500 --> 00:15:28.470
It's still a long way from a definitive answer,

302
00:15:28.730 --> 00:15:30.910
but we're probably never going to know for certain,

303
00:15:37.240 --> 00:15:40.900
The story of the to man has continued and devolved in the seven decades since he

304
00:15:40.901 --> 00:15:42.460
was dug outta the Pete BOS,

305
00:15:42.600 --> 00:15:46.260
new chapters are always being added mainly as technology progresses,

306
00:15:46.261 --> 00:15:49.620
despite their best efforts, scientists were not able to preserve to man,

307
00:15:49.621 --> 00:15:50.261
as they found him,

308
00:15:50.261 --> 00:15:54.370
they simply did not have technology or the know how back in 1950 plus some

309
00:15:54.371 --> 00:15:55.810
scholars were worried that it looked a bit too.

310
00:15:55.970 --> 00:15:59.090
Me carbed as display like that since the left half had partially decomposed,

311
00:15:59.240 --> 00:16:02.010
that is why they focused on saving the head. They were successful.

312
00:16:02.011 --> 00:16:05.170
They carefully severed the head from the rest of the body and developed a new

313
00:16:05.171 --> 00:16:06.170
preservation technique,

314
00:16:06.171 --> 00:16:09.170
which involved replacing all the bog water cells in its head with wax,

315
00:16:09.280 --> 00:16:11.210
that it retained its exact shape. However,

316
00:16:11.280 --> 00:16:13.800
this cannot be to on directly since the tube wouldn't mix.

317
00:16:13.820 --> 00:16:17.320
So instead they first had to put the head in alcohol to replace the bog water

318
00:16:17.960 --> 00:16:21.760
NAED was put in a disillusion liquid named Tula law to replace the alcohol and

319
00:16:21.761 --> 00:16:24.560
then in liquid para to replace the teal. Only after that,

320
00:16:24.561 --> 00:16:26.680
could it finally be placed and melted BEWA,

321
00:16:26.730 --> 00:16:29.800
which inserted itself into the cells of the head and replaced the para.

322
00:16:29.990 --> 00:16:32.040
This new process was successful.

323
00:16:32.060 --> 00:16:34.870
And the head of the to man remains looking just as the day,

324
00:16:34.871 --> 00:16:38.150
it was dragged outta the bog, although it had shrunk by 12%,

325
00:16:38.290 --> 00:16:41.230
the limbs in the torso Harbor did not undergo this process.

326
00:16:41.540 --> 00:16:42.790
Instead they were dried out,

327
00:16:42.920 --> 00:16:46.670
split into pieces and sent for various tests and autopsies a few decades.

328
00:16:46.800 --> 00:16:47.710
After the discovery,

329
00:16:47.711 --> 00:16:51.350
during the 1980s scientists thought that maybe they could try and assemble the

330
00:16:51.351 --> 00:16:51.990
whole body.

331
00:16:51.990 --> 00:16:55.660
It began that bizarre west to try and find all the missing parts which have been

332
00:16:55.661 --> 00:16:57.500
sent to various museums and institutes.

333
00:16:57.501 --> 00:17:01.420
Eventually they managed to find everything except the internal organs and one

334
00:17:01.800 --> 00:17:02.900
toe from the right foot,

335
00:17:02.901 --> 00:17:06.620
which had clearly been sort off the location of the toe remained a mystery until

336
00:17:06.621 --> 00:17:11.340
2016. When a woman named Bert Brosen Christensen called the sofa,

337
00:17:11.500 --> 00:17:15.450
Borg museum then told them that she had the man's big toe. She was right too.

338
00:17:15.770 --> 00:17:18.370
Tests showed that the mummified toe in her possession was a perfect match.

339
00:17:18.430 --> 00:17:19.490
The one missing from the foot.

340
00:17:19.710 --> 00:17:24.490
So how did she end up owning thes toe of a 2,400 year old Bo

341
00:17:24.730 --> 00:17:24.910
body?

342
00:17:24.910 --> 00:17:28.490
As it turns out her father bog boson Christianson was one of the people who

343
00:17:28.491 --> 00:17:31.890
worked on researching new preservation methods for the to man ber remembered

344
00:17:31.891 --> 00:17:33.410
quite vividly that when she was growing up,

345
00:17:33.411 --> 00:17:36.320
her father had a whole foot in a jar of blue liquid on his desk.

346
00:17:36.380 --> 00:17:37.880
The towy kept in a smaller jar,

347
00:17:37.881 --> 00:17:40.760
which he'd like to carry around with him and even bring to the dinner table

348
00:17:40.850 --> 00:17:42.480
after he died, his widow kept it.

349
00:17:42.481 --> 00:17:46.240
And then it ended up with bar who reunited the toe with the rest of the Tolu

350
00:17:46.520 --> 00:17:48.560
man's body. Unfortunately, despite their best efforts,

351
00:17:48.561 --> 00:17:51.400
the reassembled body of the, to man was not fit the show one,

352
00:17:51.401 --> 00:17:54.200
which is on display to dead. The silk Borg museum is replica,

353
00:17:54.500 --> 00:17:56.280
but the head is still the genuine article.

354
00:17:56.540 --> 00:17:58.440
The internal organs are still missing though.

355
00:17:58.441 --> 00:18:01.440
So if you happen to encounter a Jale of mummified organs on your travels,

356
00:18:01.460 --> 00:18:04.720
the silk Borg museum might be interested in hearing from you.

357
00:18:05.060 --> 00:18:07.040
