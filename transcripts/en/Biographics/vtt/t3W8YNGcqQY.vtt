00:00:00.180 --> 00:00:05.040
<v 0>The protagonist of today's story discovered ancient tombs explored secret</v>

2
00:00:05.240 --> 00:00:09.880
passages inside pyramids and recovered artifacts as old as

3
00:00:09.990 --> 00:00:13.840
time itself. And he did all of this while also getting into fist fights,

4
00:00:13.870 --> 00:00:17.480
foiling assassination attempts with his trustee, with dodging bullets,

5
00:00:17.481 --> 00:00:22.350
amongst Egyptian ruins and facing the opposition of a French rival. Now,

6
00:00:22.430 --> 00:00:25.190
at this point, it might sound rather familiar to you, but no,

7
00:00:25.290 --> 00:00:27.310
we are not talking about Indiana Jones.

8
00:00:27.730 --> 00:00:31.990
We don't do fictional characters here on biographics. Well, we sometimes do,

9
00:00:31.991 --> 00:00:33.830
but we're pretty sly about it though.

10
00:00:33.860 --> 00:00:37.790
Today's video is about Giovanni Batista Beon,

11
00:00:38.210 --> 00:00:42.820
the Italian circus, strong man, a Explorer tomb radar,

12
00:00:42.910 --> 00:00:47.380
early archeologists, and the father of modern Egyptology

13
00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:01.460
Giovanni bat Zo.

14
00:01:01.810 --> 00:01:06.810
He was born Giovanni beta ball zone on the 5th of November,

15
00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:10.810
1778 in Padua, Northern Italy back then a part of the independent Republic.

16
00:01:11.210 --> 00:01:11.590
Venice,

17
00:01:11.590 --> 00:01:16.050
all we know of his family is that his father was a barber and that he shared a

18
00:01:16.051 --> 00:01:17.770
home with 13 siblings.

19
00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:22.840
He just displayed signs of rebellion and lust for adventure at a very Lee H he

20
00:01:22.841 --> 00:01:27.040
was 13 when he rebelled against his father's wishes that he apprent as a barber.

21
00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:29.720
And he ran away from home dragging with him,

22
00:01:29.900 --> 00:01:33.680
his younger brother of just nine or was their objective. Well,

23
00:01:33.681 --> 00:01:38.360
that was to reach Rome, the eternal city after days of endless walking,

24
00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:39.760
they finally got there,

25
00:01:40.260 --> 00:01:45.190
or so they thought they were in bologna 400 kilometers north

26
00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:45.880
of Rome.

27
00:01:45.880 --> 00:01:50.150
Definitely not a bad start for someone who would become famous for being an

28
00:01:50.470 --> 00:01:54.630
Explorer, Giovanni or GBA as his brother used to call him.

29
00:01:54.730 --> 00:01:58.990
He did not surrender three years later with the help of an aristocratic frenzy

30
00:01:59.020 --> 00:02:02.030
finally made it to Rome. Yes. At last.

31
00:02:02.410 --> 00:02:06.540
And then his res came true because he became a barber. I mean,

32
00:02:06.541 --> 00:02:09.020
there's nothing wrong with barbers. Don't get me wrong.

33
00:02:09.140 --> 00:02:12.780
I don't mean any disrespect, but it's not exactly what he wanted to do. In fact,

34
00:02:12.880 --> 00:02:16.900
that's kind of why he left in the first place. So GIA about, at this point,

35
00:02:17.140 --> 00:02:20.780
he had started to show an interest in the new science of hydraulic engineering,

36
00:02:21.100 --> 00:02:24.370
but he did not have the occasion to put this into, to practice yet.

37
00:02:24.560 --> 00:02:27.090
Then at the age of 18, his girlfriend,

38
00:02:27.650 --> 00:02:31.690
she dumped him his totally rational and measured reaction to this was to take

39
00:02:31.930 --> 00:02:34.850
religious vows and become a caption fryer.

40
00:02:34.950 --> 00:02:37.330
It was with the monks that he first put into practice,

41
00:02:37.510 --> 00:02:42.050
his love of hydraulics by building Wells and irrigation systems for the convent.

42
00:02:42.810 --> 00:02:47.640
Geo batter had a, the soul and he soon had outgrown the convent life.

43
00:02:47.930 --> 00:02:48.840
Quite literally,

44
00:02:48.841 --> 00:02:52.960
he had become a giant of six foot seven or about two meters.

45
00:02:53.300 --> 00:02:57.120
And he was almost as wide and as strong as an ox.

46
00:02:57.310 --> 00:03:01.480
This was just not really very credible as a contemplative monk,

47
00:03:01.580 --> 00:03:06.480
but good news is history came to the rescue because Napoleon entered Roman 1798

48
00:03:06.500 --> 00:03:08.640
and dissolved all religious orders.

49
00:03:09.680 --> 00:03:13.200
Giatta had the chance to join the French army that he cited with the Prussians.

50
00:03:13.390 --> 00:03:14.223
Instead,

51
00:03:20.210 --> 00:03:22.350
Whilst traveling Europe with the Prussian army,

52
00:03:22.990 --> 00:03:27.510
GIBA realized that he was very popular at country fairs because of his size and

53
00:03:27.511 --> 00:03:29.750
people. They were willing to pay to see him.

54
00:03:30.010 --> 00:03:32.670
He also had perfected his hydraulic skills,

55
00:03:33.030 --> 00:03:36.910
creating small shows with musical fountains and magic LANs.

56
00:03:37.130 --> 00:03:38.950
At some point in the early 18 hundreds,

57
00:03:39.280 --> 00:03:43.500
he had left the army and he made his way to the Netherlands and he funded his

58
00:03:43.530 --> 00:03:44.740
travels with his shows.

59
00:03:44.960 --> 00:03:49.700
It was after one of these shows that he had a slight misunderstanding with some

60
00:03:49.701 --> 00:03:53.700
French soldiers. The details are not known except that GIA batter,

61
00:03:53.880 --> 00:03:56.180
the giants apparently battered the soldiers.

62
00:03:56.530 --> 00:04:00.490
That meant he had to flee to the only place in Europe when Napole alies couldn't

63
00:04:00.491 --> 00:04:03.170
reach him. And that was of course, great Britain.

64
00:04:03.310 --> 00:04:07.850
The first thing GBA did was change his surname from bull zone to Beon.

65
00:04:08.070 --> 00:04:10.530
You see this lad, he also had brains.

66
00:04:10.530 --> 00:04:15.130
The surname bull zone sounded suspiciously Spanish to untrained English ears.

67
00:04:15.190 --> 00:04:17.690
And Spain was an ally of Napoleon at the time.

68
00:04:18.080 --> 00:04:22.240
Then he had to ensure a livelihood for himself and for his newly weed bright

69
00:04:22.680 --> 00:04:24.920
syrup, his engineering skills were not appreciated.

70
00:04:25.020 --> 00:04:28.320
So GIA batter put into place plan B in 1803.

71
00:04:28.321 --> 00:04:32.640
He became a circus strong man with the name of the Patagonian. Samson,

72
00:04:32.960 --> 00:04:35.400
he later became known as the Roman Hercules.

73
00:04:35.660 --> 00:04:38.120
The highlight of his show was the human pyramid.

74
00:04:38.460 --> 00:04:43.230
During this act be Zonie would around the stage carrying 12 grown men

75
00:04:43.290 --> 00:04:46.550
on his back, then Sarah would climb up onto the top of the pyramid,

76
00:04:46.850 --> 00:04:48.510
waving a Crimson flag.

77
00:04:48.720 --> 00:04:53.350
Other acts included juggling flags while carrying seven men or lifting a cannon

78
00:04:53.770 --> 00:04:56.030
by its muzzle. The show also through today,

79
00:04:56.031 --> 00:05:00.390
performance of musical glasses and a magic Lanson display proving that this

80
00:05:00.400 --> 00:05:04.100
giant more intellectual ambitions than it transpired.

81
00:05:04.820 --> 00:05:07.620
Beon became very popular. And he and Sarah started touring,

82
00:05:07.621 --> 00:05:11.460
circuses and theaters all across Europe, from Edinburgh to Madrid,

83
00:05:11.650 --> 00:05:13.500
from Lisbon to Naples,

84
00:05:13.640 --> 00:05:17.820
it was during one of these travels that his life was going to change direction.

85
00:05:17.890 --> 00:05:18.723
Once again,

86
00:05:25.030 --> 00:05:27.690
In February of 1815, be Joni and his wife,

87
00:05:27.691 --> 00:05:32.330
they were sailing back from Naples when their ship was forced to dock in Malta,

88
00:05:32.410 --> 00:05:35.410
Napoleon had just fled from his Exxon in El in the British Navy.

89
00:05:35.650 --> 00:05:38.690
And the Mediterranean was inspecting all suspicious vessels.

90
00:05:38.790 --> 00:05:41.930
It was in mul that Bel Joni Mets by total chance,

91
00:05:42.440 --> 00:05:46.320
one Mr Bagha and envy of Mohamed Ali Pasha,

92
00:05:46.380 --> 00:05:47.760
the vice Roy of Egypt,

93
00:05:48.480 --> 00:05:52.200
Mohamed Ali was one of those characters who treat life like an all you can eat

94
00:05:52.201 --> 00:05:53.880
buffet, a Albanian origin.

95
00:05:54.100 --> 00:05:58.160
He traveled to Egypt in 1801 to fight against Napoleon with his band of

96
00:05:58.161 --> 00:06:02.120
mercenaries. He had quickly risen through the ranks becoming vice Roy in chiro,

97
00:06:02.640 --> 00:06:06.160
formerly subordinate to the Ottoman Salton in Istanbul. But in fact,

98
00:06:06.260 --> 00:06:09.400
the true ruler of the country doing sea pleased,

99
00:06:09.401 --> 00:06:13.400
including keeping a vast horror of wives and concubines Andy

100
00:06:13.900 --> 00:06:15.280
95 children,

101
00:06:15.740 --> 00:06:19.550
in addition to single handedly contributing to the demographic growth of Egypt,

102
00:06:19.650 --> 00:06:23.630
the pasture was also concerned with growing its economy.

103
00:06:23.850 --> 00:06:27.310
He had undertaken a vast modernization program of Egypt's agriculture,

104
00:06:27.311 --> 00:06:32.270
focusing on cash crops like cotton and tobacco that required complex irrigation

105
00:06:32.271 --> 00:06:33.950
systems. So as you might imagine,

106
00:06:33.951 --> 00:06:36.430
hydraulic experts were somewhat in high demand,

107
00:06:36.690 --> 00:06:39.860
but Joni was at this time a successful showman,

108
00:06:39.861 --> 00:06:43.940
but the Lu of his first love hydraulics, it was irresistible.

109
00:06:44.040 --> 00:06:48.180
He jumped to the occasion and sold his services to baghouse claiming that he had

110
00:06:48.380 --> 00:06:51.860
designed an irrigation wheel six times as efficient as the ones currently in use

111
00:06:52.000 --> 00:06:54.860
in the spring of 1815 B Jonni, his wife, Sarah,

112
00:06:55.220 --> 00:06:59.570
and a young Irish assistant called James cur. They landed in Cairo Cairo,

113
00:06:59.790 --> 00:07:02.810
and all of Egypt at that time was a dangerous place.

114
00:07:02.960 --> 00:07:04.850
Even if the pasta welcomed Europeans,

115
00:07:04.851 --> 00:07:08.090
they were not seen favorably by the majority of the population.

116
00:07:08.230 --> 00:07:10.130
And that included the ruling elite.

117
00:07:10.240 --> 00:07:13.810
They were suspicious and rightly so of their colonial ambitions.

118
00:07:14.190 --> 00:07:17.410
So two nations were particularly active in the Egyptian theater,

119
00:07:17.480 --> 00:07:20.400
greatly Britain and France Dar well,

120
00:07:20.401 --> 00:07:24.160
that was to extend their influence over the pasta and the country's economy.

121
00:07:24.380 --> 00:07:25.480
But most of all,

122
00:07:25.620 --> 00:07:29.880
it was to raid as many ancient Egyptian artifacts as possible to meet the

123
00:07:29.881 --> 00:07:33.080
demands of museums and private collectors back home,

124
00:07:33.460 --> 00:07:36.200
the pasta welcomed be Zonie with open arms,

125
00:07:36.300 --> 00:07:40.910
but the giant found out that his wheel was not intended to raise the waters of

126
00:07:40.911 --> 00:07:42.950
the mighty Nile to irrigate the desert.

127
00:07:43.370 --> 00:07:47.830
Its aim was simply to feed the fountains, adoring, the vice rise harm the wheel.

128
00:07:48.230 --> 00:07:52.030
It did work six times better was promised, but during its inauguration,

129
00:07:52.230 --> 00:07:56.630
a prank by some of the courts resulted in it almost crushing Bellon assistant

130
00:07:56.680 --> 00:07:57.513
James cur.

131
00:07:57.810 --> 00:08:02.140
It was almost the final curtain for curtain when the Italian leap into the canal

132
00:08:02.240 --> 00:08:03.980
and thanks to his enormous strength,

133
00:08:04.160 --> 00:08:07.020
he stopped the wheel just in time the wheel.

134
00:08:07.050 --> 00:08:11.660
Unfortunately it broke down marking the end of Belgium Jon's hydraulic career in

135
00:08:11.670 --> 00:08:14.220
Egypt. So, well, what now?

136
00:08:21.050 --> 00:08:24.610
Muhammad Ali took pity on belt Zonie and his wife and introduced them to the

137
00:08:24.611 --> 00:08:25.650
British console. Sir,

138
00:08:25.651 --> 00:08:30.530
Henry salt salt had been tasked by the crown to collect statues Sarov guy

139
00:08:30.670 --> 00:08:34.290
and other pieces to replenish the Egyptian collection at the British museum,

140
00:08:34.420 --> 00:08:39.330
which at that time was lagging behind that of their mortal rivals the Lou of

141
00:08:39.331 --> 00:08:43.920
museum and Paris salt's counterpart in the French camp was cons Bernard

142
00:08:44.240 --> 00:08:47.360
D nor DTI born in Teran in Northern Italy,

143
00:08:48.040 --> 00:08:51.960
grati at fought alongside Napoleon against the hated Austrians.

144
00:08:52.060 --> 00:08:55.000
His military pros earns him a French citizenship,

145
00:08:55.080 --> 00:08:59.760
and it's given him a taste for the use of explosives muskets and the services of

146
00:08:59.761 --> 00:09:03.320
cutthroats. Now I should clarify at this point that neither of these guys,

147
00:09:03.500 --> 00:09:07.280
nor their employees or archeologists, let alone Egyptologists,

148
00:09:07.730 --> 00:09:09.920
these were just glorified tomb, Raiders,

149
00:09:09.940 --> 00:09:14.200
and art thieves with little respects or knowledge of the culture that they were

150
00:09:14.280 --> 00:09:14.590
plunged.

151
00:09:14.590 --> 00:09:19.110
A ring Henry Saltz was looking for a strong and resolute man who could succeed,

152
00:09:19.111 --> 00:09:20.870
where DTI had failed.

153
00:09:21.170 --> 00:09:24.390
He wanted someone to collect a giant bust of the Pharaoh.

154
00:09:24.520 --> 00:09:28.670
Rames the SAS from the ruins of ancient thieves in Southern Egypt.

155
00:09:28.890 --> 00:09:32.790
He then wanted that loaded onto a boat on the island, transported to Cairo.

156
00:09:32.890 --> 00:09:35.500
The French consoles had even drilled a hole into the Kings head,

157
00:09:35.501 --> 00:09:40.100
bloated it with explosives and tried to blow it apart into pieces so that it was

158
00:09:40.101 --> 00:09:43.980
easier to carry. It didn't work. And the statue it remained intact.

159
00:09:50.460 --> 00:09:54.580
Salt gave be Zonie a very detailed set of instructions for his recovery mission.

160
00:09:54.940 --> 00:09:58.770
The last of these in instructions was don't drop it in the Nile.

161
00:09:59.610 --> 00:10:03.330
Beon could not wait to face the stone giants and left the THS immediately.

162
00:10:03.510 --> 00:10:07.330
He soon realized that the only way to shift the nine foot tall seven ton heavy

163
00:10:07.331 --> 00:10:12.210
statue across five miles of sands was to use the same technology used by the

164
00:10:12.211 --> 00:10:16.440
ancient Egyptians, a wooden sled ropes and she labor.

165
00:10:16.780 --> 00:10:21.440
Now it was a known tactic employed by DTI that he would send his agents to stir

166
00:10:21.960 --> 00:10:24.400
descend among the locals to hinder his rivals efforts.

167
00:10:24.470 --> 00:10:27.880
This may explain why during the first days of the thieves expedition,

168
00:10:28.070 --> 00:10:31.080
some of bell Zon he's hired workers, they turned against him.

169
00:10:31.140 --> 00:10:33.560
The leaders of the rebels attacked him with a dagger,

170
00:10:33.780 --> 00:10:36.360
the Italian giant Cooley disarmed them,

171
00:10:36.550 --> 00:10:40.710
knocked them out cold and lifted them by their ankles and swung them around in

172
00:10:40.711 --> 00:10:43.670
order to inflict blows on the other attackers. Now it's important.

173
00:10:43.730 --> 00:10:45.590
We point out so that we at biographics,

174
00:10:45.591 --> 00:10:49.790
we don't endorse this as a method of resolving trade disputes,

175
00:10:50.050 --> 00:10:53.590
but we have to admit that as far as self to feds goes pretty badass.

176
00:10:54.030 --> 00:10:56.830
The re it was quells. And after three weeks of hardware,

177
00:10:57.390 --> 00:11:01.780
Rames the second gigantic head was sailing down river towards Cairo.

178
00:11:01.880 --> 00:11:04.860
It did not drop in the Nile and escorted by the great belt.

179
00:11:05.340 --> 00:11:08.780
Zonie the bust made it all the way back to England. Rames the head.

180
00:11:09.040 --> 00:11:11.220
It still sits today at the British museum

181
00:11:17.670 --> 00:11:18.930
In the summer of 18,

182
00:11:19.210 --> 00:11:23.850
17 Beon was back in Egypt now heading for his second expedition to

183
00:11:23.851 --> 00:11:27.090
unearth the legendary temple of Abu Simbel.

184
00:11:27.390 --> 00:11:31.450
The colosal structure at the time was almost completely buried in sand with just

185
00:11:31.590 --> 00:11:33.210
one head poking out of the sand.

186
00:11:33.930 --> 00:11:38.800
Beon was escorted by two British Navy officer James Iby and Charles mangle.

187
00:11:38.801 --> 00:11:42.280
These two were not really interested in ancient Egyptian architecture.

188
00:11:42.470 --> 00:11:46.680
They had joined with the hope of doing what every British gentleman of that time

189
00:11:46.740 --> 00:11:50.760
was expected to do. Get into a firefight with the French.

190
00:11:51.140 --> 00:11:53.040
The party did not have to face VEI though,

191
00:11:53.140 --> 00:11:56.760
but rather a giant dune covering the Temple's entrance.

192
00:11:57.010 --> 00:11:59.480
After six weeks of constant digging under the,

193
00:12:00.040 --> 00:12:03.480
the summer sun on the 1st of August 18, 17,

194
00:12:03.960 --> 00:12:08.480
the three Europeans and the local laborers finally entered one of the grandest

195
00:12:08.510 --> 00:12:10.000
temples of ancient times,

196
00:12:10.340 --> 00:12:13.950
the first humans to do so in more than 3000 years,

197
00:12:14.670 --> 00:12:18.870
Beon found out that there were no jewels mummies or statues to be seized,

198
00:12:18.930 --> 00:12:21.230
but he did not leave completely empty handed.

199
00:12:21.530 --> 00:12:23.390
He drafted a detailed map of the temple,

200
00:12:23.570 --> 00:12:26.430
noting all measurements and proportions of note.

201
00:12:26.620 --> 00:12:29.270
This is the detail that set him apart from other grave robbers.

202
00:12:29.370 --> 00:12:34.260
He had a desire to acquire knowledge and understands the art architecture of

203
00:12:34.261 --> 00:12:36.420
the ancient Egyptian civilization,

204
00:12:42.760 --> 00:12:44.540
But he also had to make a living.

205
00:12:44.680 --> 00:12:49.140
So he returned THS to look for more statues on behalf of salt and the British

206
00:12:49.141 --> 00:12:53.460
museum. When he got there, he was met by a bad surprise. The site had been,

207
00:12:53.730 --> 00:12:56.170
had taken over by a party of French diggers.

208
00:12:56.650 --> 00:12:59.810
Mel Zonie was well known to them and he knew he'd better avoid them,

209
00:13:00.030 --> 00:13:02.610
but he was spotted Dre's men had firearms.

210
00:13:02.630 --> 00:13:06.050
And so he was forced to flee during the chase through the ruins of thieves,

211
00:13:06.051 --> 00:13:09.770
one of the French fighters, pistol narrowly missing the giant man,

212
00:13:10.070 --> 00:13:12.770
the Italian wrote to console Henry salt in Cairo things.

213
00:13:12.771 --> 00:13:14.320
They were getting dangerous with him.

214
00:13:14.321 --> 00:13:16.840
And as an agent of his Majesty's cons services,

215
00:13:16.980 --> 00:13:19.840
he had every right to demand armed protection.

216
00:13:19.980 --> 00:13:23.880
The thieves chase was not the only instance in which be Zonie had reason to fear

217
00:13:23.881 --> 00:13:25.960
for his life. Once in the port of Alexandria,

218
00:13:25.961 --> 00:13:29.040
he had been approached by DTIs interpreter, uh, fellow Italian,

219
00:13:29.100 --> 00:13:33.440
who had told him in clear terms, if I see you around one of our sites,

220
00:13:33.960 --> 00:13:36.590
our slit you your throat in another occasion,

221
00:13:37.110 --> 00:13:39.310
Baldon was riding through the streets of Cairo.

222
00:13:39.311 --> 00:13:42.150
When he was aggressively confronted by an Egyptian officer,

223
00:13:42.420 --> 00:13:44.230
demanding passage through an alley,

224
00:13:44.370 --> 00:13:48.470
the officer did not wait for an answer and delivered a blow to build Sony's

225
00:13:48.471 --> 00:13:51.190
stomach. The giants. He simply did not flinch,

226
00:13:51.570 --> 00:13:54.030
not being accustomed to put up with such situations.

227
00:13:54.470 --> 00:13:58.620
I returned of the compliment and struck him with my whip across his shoulders.

228
00:13:58.920 --> 00:14:01.900
The officer then took his pistol and shot at be Zonie,

229
00:14:01.901 --> 00:14:03.300
but the Italian dodged the bullet,

230
00:14:03.680 --> 00:14:06.900
and it went on to hit another soldier who was approaching him from behind,

231
00:14:13.200 --> 00:14:16.250
During a later exploration to the Oasis of Al Kasar.

232
00:14:16.270 --> 00:14:20.210
His two local guides tried to kill be Zon in his sleep. Once again,

233
00:14:20.230 --> 00:14:23.850
he was quick to react and strangled the two assassins in self defense.

234
00:14:24.030 --> 00:14:25.570
And it's at this point that we have to wonder,

235
00:14:25.850 --> 00:14:30.210
did these people really see no risk in a tracking a six foot seven inch strong

236
00:14:30.450 --> 00:14:34.490
man? I mean, there are risks involved with such an endeavor, but anyway, Beon,

237
00:14:34.610 --> 00:14:36.640
he didn't always have the other hands ins another mission.

238
00:14:36.700 --> 00:14:41.480
He had collected a monumental OS from the island of Fila on the Nile near wan,

239
00:14:41.700 --> 00:14:43.680
but all of his artwork was to be in vain.

240
00:14:43.681 --> 00:14:47.520
As Ravi's men seized the OSC by holding the giant a gun point.

241
00:14:53.700 --> 00:14:58.440
And now let's go back to Meloni's message to Sal in August of 1817.

242
00:14:58.750 --> 00:15:01.680
This is when Sal laid out his cards in reply.

243
00:15:01.681 --> 00:15:05.200
He specified that be Zonie had not been employed officially by the British

244
00:15:05.201 --> 00:15:09.600
governments or the British museum salt considered him to be his own private

245
00:15:10.120 --> 00:15:14.030
employee. A little more than a mercenary. This made a big difference.

246
00:15:14.170 --> 00:15:15.870
It made well Zon, disposable,

247
00:15:15.930 --> 00:15:19.390
and his findings were private property insults hands.

248
00:15:19.730 --> 00:15:21.390
The Italian was not happy,

249
00:15:21.530 --> 00:15:26.270
but he continued his travels away from the dangers of thieves, his next target.

250
00:15:26.830 --> 00:15:29.150
Well, that was the legendary valley of the Kings,

251
00:15:29.151 --> 00:15:32.540
where he made some initial interesting discoveries. However,

252
00:15:32.640 --> 00:15:35.140
at this time higher cliffs had not yet been deciphered. So in fact,

253
00:15:35.141 --> 00:15:38.900
he didn't really have any idea what he had discovered. As an example,

254
00:15:39.000 --> 00:15:40.860
he once stumbled into the tomb of king,

255
00:15:41.140 --> 00:15:44.300
I but only noted a wall painting of 12 baboons.

256
00:15:44.370 --> 00:15:49.020
Therefore he called it the tomb of the 12 monkeys. Now grace of movement,

257
00:15:49.040 --> 00:15:53.370
as he might imagine was definitely not his fourth day by his own confession when

258
00:15:53.371 --> 00:15:55.610
needing a rest inside the same tomb,

259
00:15:56.050 --> 00:15:58.410
I sought a resting place and contrived to sit,

260
00:15:58.550 --> 00:16:01.330
but when my weight bore on the body of an Egyptian,

261
00:16:01.470 --> 00:16:03.650
it crushed it like a band box.

262
00:16:04.010 --> 00:16:08.890
I sunk among the broken mummies with a crash of bones, rags and wooden cases.

263
00:16:09.300 --> 00:16:14.000
Every step I took, I crushed a mummy in some part or other. So yes,

264
00:16:14.240 --> 00:16:17.640
in just a few moments, he essentially destroyed a museum's worth of content.

265
00:16:17.980 --> 00:16:18.801
As another example,

266
00:16:18.801 --> 00:16:22.720
another time the Italian came across an ancient Warland ordered his Workman to

267
00:16:22.721 --> 00:16:27.280
open a passage, using a sophisticated scientific instrument, a battering Ram.

268
00:16:27.580 --> 00:16:31.400
His experience in the valley of the Kings was not all slapstick. However,

269
00:16:31.401 --> 00:16:35.150
following hints from the local legends on the 6th of October 18, 17,

270
00:16:35.170 --> 00:16:36.910
he made his greatest discovery.

271
00:16:37.250 --> 00:16:40.310
So far the entrance to the tomb of SETI,

272
00:16:40.311 --> 00:16:44.750
the first a richly decorated sprawling burial site, the size of St.

273
00:16:44.751 --> 00:16:46.110
Paul's cathedral in London.

274
00:16:46.490 --> 00:16:51.350
The monument is still also known as be Zon tomb and was described as the

275
00:16:51.710 --> 00:16:54.660
cistine chapel of ancient Egypts when news reached Cairo,

276
00:16:54.661 --> 00:16:58.660
Henry salt organized a tour of the site with a group of British aristocrats who

277
00:16:58.661 --> 00:17:01.780
looked down on belt Zonie as a simple hired hand,

278
00:17:02.250 --> 00:17:06.380
this was the end of the collaboration between the two men be Zonie realized that

279
00:17:06.620 --> 00:17:10.260
salt had been taken credit for his achievements with the British establishments,

280
00:17:10.640 --> 00:17:11.860
not only vast,

281
00:17:11.960 --> 00:17:15.810
the console had failed to ship many Beson specimens to the British museum and

282
00:17:15.811 --> 00:17:18.530
had been selling them at private auctions. Instead,

283
00:17:24.710 --> 00:17:28.970
The Italian rescinded his contract with Salton continued working on his own,

284
00:17:28.971 --> 00:17:32.210
adding another string of explorations under his belts.

285
00:17:32.211 --> 00:17:33.970
And then on the 2nd of March,

286
00:17:33.970 --> 00:17:38.160
1880 was his last great achievement having visited the pyramid at Giza belt.

287
00:17:38.560 --> 00:17:41.480
Zonie became fascinated with the pyramid of Heen.

288
00:17:41.830 --> 00:17:43.360
This was the second largest pyramid,

289
00:17:43.460 --> 00:17:47.560
and it was generally recognized as being inaccesible following a hunch.

290
00:17:47.561 --> 00:17:50.680
The Italian found secret entrances on the north side of the building and

291
00:17:50.681 --> 00:17:51.760
crawling inside it.

292
00:17:51.761 --> 00:17:56.240
He came across a burial chamber and toward its subterranean section to avoid

293
00:17:56.241 --> 00:17:58.760
having his discovery appropriated by DTI or salt.

294
00:17:58.900 --> 00:18:02.840
He quickly scrolled on a wall discovered by G Beon,

295
00:18:03.020 --> 00:18:06.960
2nd of March 18, 18, but in Italian, it was like this

296
00:18:13.410 --> 00:18:14.120
By 1820,

297
00:18:14.120 --> 00:18:18.950
after five years of adventures Zuni and Sarah were back in London being a

298
00:18:18.951 --> 00:18:21.150
showman to the core of the giant organized,

299
00:18:21.270 --> 00:18:26.070
a spectacular live dissection of a mum for the Royal college of surgeons and

300
00:18:26.170 --> 00:18:30.260
an exhibition of Egyptian antiquities and Piccadilly, both were very popular.

301
00:18:30.640 --> 00:18:35.380
His main endeavor was to set the record straight with salt and claim the credit

302
00:18:35.410 --> 00:18:37.100
that was due for his discoveries.

303
00:18:37.240 --> 00:18:41.540
He wrote an accounts of his adventure entitled narratives of the operations and

304
00:18:41.541 --> 00:18:44.100
recent discoveries within the pyramids, temples, tombs,

305
00:18:44.160 --> 00:18:49.100
and excavations in Egypt and NUIA and of a journey to the coast of

306
00:18:49.101 --> 00:18:49.890
the red.

307
00:18:49.890 --> 00:18:54.850
See in search of the ancient Beese and another to the Oasis of

308
00:18:54.960 --> 00:18:55.793
Jupiter,

309
00:18:56.170 --> 00:19:00.530
Aman by Giovanni Patista Valon two volumes.

310
00:19:00.780 --> 00:19:03.010
We're gonna assume that the first one, there is the title,

311
00:19:03.390 --> 00:19:07.010
the enormously long title, the book, it had some success. It, however,

312
00:19:07.070 --> 00:19:11.960
it seems that salt eventually won this dual of fame until recently

313
00:19:11.990 --> 00:19:16.240
most of B Zonis recovered artifacts at the British museum were still known as

314
00:19:16.241 --> 00:19:17.120
the salt collection

315
00:19:23.660 --> 00:19:27.640
In the spring of 1823 B Zonie left London for another adventure.

316
00:19:27.830 --> 00:19:30.280
This time he was in search of the source of the,

317
00:19:30.360 --> 00:19:35.110
of Ija in west Africa and of the lost city of Tim BTU in modern day,

318
00:19:35.550 --> 00:19:35.690
Mali,

319
00:19:35.690 --> 00:19:40.150
the Italian was forced to take a long detour of IC because of a local war raging

320
00:19:40.210 --> 00:19:43.070
in Southern Morocco. And so in November of 1823,

321
00:19:43.290 --> 00:19:47.190
he landed in Benin with a British merchant, John Houston.

322
00:19:47.530 --> 00:19:52.100
It was here that Beon met his ultimate fur. I ironically for such a giant,

323
00:19:52.120 --> 00:19:56.900
it was a tiny creature that would succeed where cutthroats and French bullets

324
00:19:57.040 --> 00:20:01.580
had failed Zuni, contracted dysentery, a bacterial infection of the bowels,

325
00:20:01.581 --> 00:20:05.180
highly prevalent in tropical areas, which in severe cases make,

326
00:20:05.380 --> 00:20:09.980
was death by dehydration. And this was one of those cases, feeling death,

327
00:20:09.981 --> 00:20:11.810
creeping in the ones, mighty men,

328
00:20:11.811 --> 00:20:16.450
Hercules entrusted an amethyst to his companion for it to be given to his wife

329
00:20:16.790 --> 00:20:18.610
on the 3rd of December, 1823,

330
00:20:18.810 --> 00:20:23.530
Giovanni Batista be Zon died and was buried under a tree in

331
00:20:24.050 --> 00:20:24.883
GUSO. Ben

332
00:20:31.690 --> 00:20:36.400
