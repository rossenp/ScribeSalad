00:00:00.060 --> 00:00:01.000
<v 0>In late 1840,</v>

2
00:00:01.140 --> 00:00:05.680
the great powers of Europe gathered after the fall of Napoleon to discuss what

3
00:00:05.681 --> 00:00:08.440
to do next at the time, the consonants, it was in ruins.

4
00:00:08.660 --> 00:00:13.200
The old order that exploded as effectively as if someone had detonated an,

5
00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:17.760
a bomb below it, just as it would in 1945,

6
00:00:17.761 --> 00:00:21.990
Europe needed a new roadmap, a blueprint to the future,

7
00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:26.470
designing that blueprint. Well, they fell to one. Man met Nick.

8
00:00:26.650 --> 00:00:29.670
The foreign minister of the Austrian empire met Nick was a dandy,

9
00:00:29.671 --> 00:00:34.110
a womanizer and a comically pompous for, in addition to all of that,

10
00:00:34.111 --> 00:00:37.510
he was also one of the greatest diplomats who ever lived under his guidance.

11
00:00:37.700 --> 00:00:42.380
<v 1>Post Napoleon Europe was forged into a conserv system that would last</v>

12
00:00:42.560 --> 00:00:43.980
nearly a hundred years.

13
00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:48.780
His blueprint ensured the continents 19th century was far less bloody than

14
00:00:48.800 --> 00:00:51.420
either its 18th or its 20th yet.

15
00:00:51.421 --> 00:00:55.780
Meta Nick also tried to strangle the forces of nationalism at birthed in doing

16
00:00:55.880 --> 00:00:59.220
so. He set the stage for his own destruction,

17
00:00:59.700 --> 00:01:02.730
a master strategist to some, a vein buffoon to others.

18
00:01:03.320 --> 00:01:06.170
This is the life of Europe's Coachmen.

19
00:01:18.510 --> 00:01:22.680
<v 0>The world me was born into would be unrecognizable to bus today.</v>

20
00:01:22.820 --> 00:01:25.160
The center of Europe was dominated not by Germany,

21
00:01:25.300 --> 00:01:29.520
but by something known as the holy Roman empire millennia,

22
00:01:29.760 --> 00:01:32.080
old collection of tiny states all joined together.

23
00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:36.520
It was in one of these tiny states on the west bank of the rhyme that met an was

24
00:01:36.521 --> 00:01:40.520
born on may the 15th, 17 S three, or to give him his full name.

25
00:01:40.521 --> 00:01:43.150
That would be Clemmens veil NA per Loha.

26
00:01:43.510 --> 00:01:48.430
First VA met Nick Berg Baine and I'm sure I screwed up the pronunciation on

27
00:01:48.431 --> 00:01:50.470
that. You can have a GMY if you want to.

28
00:01:50.790 --> 00:01:53.430
Although met Nick was from the Germanic, holy Roman am empire.

29
00:01:53.431 --> 00:01:56.630
It was France that had the biggest impact on his early life.

30
00:01:57.030 --> 00:02:01.390
Met Nick's home state was right on the buffer zone with the France of Louie the

31
00:02:01.391 --> 00:02:04.980
16th. So the boy grew up speaking better French than he did German.

32
00:02:05.130 --> 00:02:09.740
Despite his father being an Austrian Envoy. This wasn't all that unusual though.

33
00:02:09.741 --> 00:02:13.260
France exerted a powerful pull over continental or Europe in the 18th century.

34
00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:18.020
And it seemed totally natural that met Nick would be sent off to the French city

35
00:02:18.021 --> 00:02:21.620
of STRs Borg to complete his education in 1788.

36
00:02:21.650 --> 00:02:25.610
Unfortunately for the teenage met in France at the end of the 1780s,

37
00:02:25.830 --> 00:02:28.250
it was a ticking time bomb on July the 14th,

38
00:02:28.690 --> 00:02:33.450
1789 years of political turmoil in Paris exploded onto the

39
00:02:33.451 --> 00:02:37.610
streets, a mob stormed, the Bastille armor lynching, the Garrison commander.

40
00:02:37.800 --> 00:02:42.570
This, this was the opening salvo of the French revolution.

41
00:02:42.710 --> 00:02:45.640
And it was about to the entire continent.

42
00:02:46.190 --> 00:02:50.560
Despite being the sort of age when waving the revolutionary flag might seem

43
00:02:50.561 --> 00:02:51.394
appealing.

44
00:02:51.680 --> 00:02:56.000
Madic was disgusted by the unfolding drama for MEIC any upending of the natural

45
00:02:56.040 --> 00:03:00.360
conservative order of Europe was an athema. He become Strasburg for mines,

46
00:03:00.710 --> 00:03:03.800
posthaste, but betta Nick was about to learn a very important lesson.

47
00:03:04.110 --> 00:03:06.680
When the cannon ball of revolution gets rolling.

48
00:03:07.430 --> 00:03:09.920
There's no escape in April of 1792,

49
00:03:09.960 --> 00:03:14.240
a French army whipped into a revolutionary frenzy invaded the holy Roman and

50
00:03:14.241 --> 00:03:18.950
empire burning pillaging and destroying by now posted diplomatic

51
00:03:19.190 --> 00:03:20.630
position in the Austria, Netherlands,

52
00:03:20.730 --> 00:03:25.270
AKA Belgium alongside his father met Nick was forced to watch in horror as the

53
00:03:25.271 --> 00:03:28.590
French annexed, his family's home state in 1794,

54
00:03:28.720 --> 00:03:30.630
which left them with nothing bar.

55
00:03:30.910 --> 00:03:32.910
He got his head around this when the French overran,

56
00:03:32.930 --> 00:03:35.310
the Austria Netherlands and the boy and his father,

57
00:03:35.380 --> 00:03:39.620
they were forced to flee to Vienna. Although the Metanx were now few GS,

58
00:03:39.621 --> 00:03:43.060
they were still people of means with good connections to Austria's elite.

59
00:03:43.320 --> 00:03:48.220
So met Nick exile was less Moses in the desert and more rich Playboy

60
00:03:48.221 --> 00:03:52.180
sleeping around in Vienna, even managed to marry and an Vaun.

61
00:03:52.440 --> 00:03:56.460
The daughter of Austria's former chancellor while met Nick was serially

62
00:03:56.461 --> 00:03:57.780
unfaithful to how the marriage.

63
00:03:57.840 --> 00:04:01.890
It still meant family up in the world of Austrian politics,

64
00:04:02.110 --> 00:04:06.490
but fate and France, they weren't done with met on November the ninth,

65
00:04:06.890 --> 00:04:09.770
1799, a French army officer staged Aku in Paris,

66
00:04:09.800 --> 00:04:14.250
putting himself in charge of the revolutionary war machine, that dude's name.

67
00:04:14.810 --> 00:04:16.650
Well, that would be Napoleon Bonna apart.

68
00:04:16.850 --> 00:04:19.850
And he was about to plunge Europe into utter chaos.

69
00:04:26.470 --> 00:04:27.640
From Metanx perspective,

70
00:04:27.740 --> 00:04:32.200
the 19th century must have felt like settling into a comfy arm chair that

71
00:04:32.360 --> 00:04:36.400
suddenly grows teeth and then devours you in 1801.

72
00:04:36.600 --> 00:04:40.480
Vienna's newest man about town was promoted to ambassador and he was sent to Dr.

73
00:04:40.910 --> 00:04:44.790
Resident. And then he was sent to Berlin. As Napoleon kept conquering.

74
00:04:45.310 --> 00:04:48.710
Mattick enjoyed the Prussian capital's night life all while gamely,

75
00:04:48.711 --> 00:04:52.830
trying to persuade his hosts to join Vienna in a war against France.

76
00:04:53.290 --> 00:04:55.630
So for a guy known for his diplomatic acumen,

77
00:04:55.650 --> 00:04:58.790
we described him as one of the greatest diplomats who ever lived. Matt.

78
00:04:59.110 --> 00:05:03.300
Nick totally messed this one up after years of controlling the Prussians,

79
00:05:03.301 --> 00:05:07.380
they finally put their foot down in 1805 and told him

80
00:05:08.050 --> 00:05:11.700
nine. That was the moments, the geopolitical arm chair.

81
00:05:12.080 --> 00:05:16.620
It swallowed our young ambassador whole on December, the second, 1806,

82
00:05:16.680 --> 00:05:21.300
the Russian holy Roman and Austrian armies minus PR all met to battle

83
00:05:21.950 --> 00:05:23.930
in France at Oz,

84
00:05:24.230 --> 00:05:28.410
the Napoleonic army mopped the floor with them.

85
00:05:28.670 --> 00:05:32.890
The third coalition lost the battle so badly that the holy Roman

86
00:05:33.350 --> 00:05:37.970
empire was destroyed. Austria was forced to become an ally of France.

87
00:05:38.730 --> 00:05:42.640
Would things have gone differently if pressure had been there? Well it's to say,

88
00:05:42.920 --> 00:05:45.440
but they couldn't have exactly gone any worse.

89
00:05:45.890 --> 00:05:50.160
Still meta Nick's catastrophic fail in Berlin did not stop him from getting an

90
00:05:50.161 --> 00:05:54.000
ambassadorship to Paris under Austria's. Now pro Napoleon leadership.

91
00:05:54.290 --> 00:05:58.200
Sadly MEIC had not learned from his mistakes on may the second, 1808,

92
00:05:58.360 --> 00:06:02.960
an uprising in French occupied Spain triggered a crisis in Paris egged on by met

93
00:06:03.330 --> 00:06:06.400
breathless reports that Napoleon was losing his grip on power.

94
00:06:07.040 --> 00:06:09.280
Vienna took a risky gamble in 1809.

95
00:06:09.281 --> 00:06:12.640
Austria rolled everything on a surprise attack.

96
00:06:13.160 --> 00:06:17.830
When he Al that one went the war of the fifth coalition was a monumental

97
00:06:17.831 --> 00:06:21.190
embarrassment for Austria Napoleon. He just crushed them.

98
00:06:21.410 --> 00:06:25.510
Not only that he imposed one of the most humiliating peace treaters in all of

99
00:06:25.511 --> 00:06:26.344
history.

100
00:06:26.350 --> 00:06:31.350
Vienna lost a ton of territory and was forced to pay Paris a ton of money as

101
00:06:31.351 --> 00:06:33.310
well. Ferme personally though,

102
00:06:33.311 --> 00:06:36.550
things turned out surprisingly well in the aftermath of the new treaty.

103
00:06:36.590 --> 00:06:40.820
He escaped to blame. Not only that, he also got promoted on October the eighth,

104
00:06:41.580 --> 00:06:44.900
80 0 9 and B Francis. The first made met then just 36 years old,

105
00:06:45.120 --> 00:06:46.900
his foreign minister that's supposed,

106
00:06:46.901 --> 00:06:50.260
he would hold for the next 40 years with Nabo. Now,

107
00:06:50.261 --> 00:06:51.620
basically in charge of Europe,

108
00:06:51.621 --> 00:06:55.940
Austria's new foreign minister was forced to use all of his legendary charm to

109
00:06:56.080 --> 00:06:59.890
try and placate. This created some humiliating moments,

110
00:06:59.891 --> 00:07:02.530
such as when Napoleon invaded Russia in 1812,

111
00:07:02.600 --> 00:07:06.570
Austria was forced to send its own army in support of the French well,

112
00:07:06.890 --> 00:07:10.090
net and air managed to secure their nominal independence under Austrian

113
00:07:10.091 --> 00:07:10.924
commanders.

114
00:07:11.370 --> 00:07:16.290
It was just crumbs from Napoleon table or so it seemed when Napoleons

115
00:07:16.291 --> 00:07:18.800
latest adventure unexpectedly blue up in his face,

116
00:07:18.801 --> 00:07:21.480
Austria was able to sign a peace deal with the Russians.

117
00:07:21.840 --> 00:07:25.600
Vienna could then sit out of the catastrophic French retreat across the

118
00:07:25.601 --> 00:07:26.880
continent for his part.

119
00:07:27.560 --> 00:07:31.160
Madic didn't believe that this was really the end of Napoleon in mid 18, 13.

120
00:07:31.180 --> 00:07:35.120
He tried to broker a peace deal between France and Russia and Russia that would

121
00:07:35.121 --> 00:07:39.350
allow Napoleon to stay on the throne. It was only when Napoleon said no,

122
00:07:39.500 --> 00:07:42.790
that met, signed Austria up to the sixth coalition.

123
00:07:43.250 --> 00:07:44.590
If you recognize that name,

124
00:07:44.591 --> 00:07:48.230
the sixth coalition it's because these are the guys that actually did it.

125
00:07:48.420 --> 00:07:53.150
They are the ones that rid Europe of its tyrants on March 31st, 18,

126
00:07:53.390 --> 00:07:54.750
14, the armies of the sixth coalition.

127
00:07:54.820 --> 00:07:58.870
They captured Paris with COEX marching down the banks of the San Napoleon.

128
00:07:59.120 --> 00:08:02.060
He finally threw in the towel, the petite corporal abdicated,

129
00:08:02.120 --> 00:08:05.180
and was exiled to the island of El across the Europe.

130
00:08:05.590 --> 00:08:07.420
Cries of victory went up,

131
00:08:07.640 --> 00:08:10.860
but there was just one teeny tiny problem.

132
00:08:11.770 --> 00:08:13.860
What the heck did everyone do now

133
00:08:20.050 --> 00:08:23.970
Signed for us to take a quick step back in time to something called the treaty

134
00:08:24.070 --> 00:08:28.810
of RK signed in 1713 at the end of the war of Spanish succession,

135
00:08:28.950 --> 00:08:32.570
the treaty was designed to keep Europe super powers from super killing each

136
00:08:32.571 --> 00:08:35.650
other by delicately balancing power between them.

137
00:08:35.790 --> 00:08:38.130
The French revolution had exposed the limits of this century,

138
00:08:38.410 --> 00:08:41.600
old treaty even before. And the POS defeat in 1814,

139
00:08:42.080 --> 00:08:43.560
everyone knew that a new treaty was needed.

140
00:08:43.620 --> 00:08:48.280
One that would ensure against another continent wide war. Unfortunately,

141
00:08:48.300 --> 00:08:50.240
all the great powers that had just defeated France.

142
00:08:50.510 --> 00:08:51.800
They all wanted different things.

143
00:08:51.980 --> 00:08:55.920
Now we'll get into the nitty gritty in a minute. Just know that for now,

144
00:08:56.200 --> 00:09:01.120
everyone in 1814 was aware that a mishandled post Napoleon piece could be

145
00:09:01.320 --> 00:09:06.280
catastrophic before the six coalition had even won that agreed to a Congress to

146
00:09:06.281 --> 00:09:09.280
hammer all of their differences out somehow met.

147
00:09:09.720 --> 00:09:11.600
He convinced them to hold it in Vienna.

148
00:09:12.020 --> 00:09:16.670
The Congress of Vienna is one of the most important diplomatic gatherings

149
00:09:16.930 --> 00:09:17.763
in history.

150
00:09:17.850 --> 00:09:21.470
So to make sure we can all get our heads around this extremely important event,

151
00:09:21.471 --> 00:09:24.870
we're gonna need to take a quick detour through some of the main players.

152
00:09:25.380 --> 00:09:29.030
This is gonna get a little bit intense. So pay attention, please.

153
00:09:29.370 --> 00:09:31.550
The four key powers at the Congress were Austria,

154
00:09:31.860 --> 00:09:36.420
obviously as well as Russia pressure and great Britain since Austria

155
00:09:36.680 --> 00:09:40.740
was playing on their home turf. That means putting MEIC in charge of everything.

156
00:09:41.000 --> 00:09:44.900
His goals were to maintain the balance of power by ensuring that postwar fronts

157
00:09:44.901 --> 00:09:49.780
didn't get too weak and Russia and PR did not get too strong Britain. Meanwhile,

158
00:09:49.800 --> 00:09:54.740
and guy over called via count Carre who broadly agreed with MEIC about

159
00:09:55.000 --> 00:09:58.970
not to in France and not giving Russia and Russia. Everything.

160
00:09:59.610 --> 00:10:03.330
Russia sent a delegation who were led from behind the scenes by the big boss,

161
00:10:03.331 --> 00:10:07.450
Frederick VI hem III on Freddy's grand plan was to hobble,

162
00:10:07.451 --> 00:10:10.770
France and gobble Upsy for Berlin. Finally,

163
00:10:10.950 --> 00:10:14.290
Russia sent the head honcho himself, Sarah Alexander.

164
00:10:14.530 --> 00:10:17.000
The first was the Congress, his wild card.

165
00:10:17.140 --> 00:10:19.600
Not only was he negotiating for Russia personally,

166
00:10:19.820 --> 00:10:23.840
but he also wanted some odd things like giving the polls their own country.

167
00:10:24.160 --> 00:10:27.800
A big deal since PRS and Austria, both owned Polish territory.

168
00:10:28.200 --> 00:10:30.400
Although the table was designed for four people,

169
00:10:30.800 --> 00:10:33.720
there was one last guy to add into the mix.

170
00:10:33.990 --> 00:10:37.270
This was char Murray to tell Aran per better known,

171
00:10:37.271 --> 00:10:41.070
just as tell he was a French diplomat and weasel

172
00:10:41.450 --> 00:10:45.950
extraordinaire. He was so adaptable that it served under Louie, the 16th,

173
00:10:46.090 --> 00:10:49.070
the French revolutionary government and an Napoleon.

174
00:10:49.170 --> 00:10:52.630
And now he was in Vienna claiming to represent the recently restored French

175
00:10:53.190 --> 00:10:54.590
Monarch, Louie, the 18th,

176
00:10:54.940 --> 00:10:59.180
obviously pressure and Russia trying to of TRO outta the room, France. I mean,

177
00:10:59.420 --> 00:11:02.420
they'd just been defeated. That was simply no seat for him,

178
00:11:02.520 --> 00:11:04.340
but MEIC thought rather differently.

179
00:11:04.700 --> 00:11:07.580
Remember he wanted to make France weaker than under Napoleon,

180
00:11:07.581 --> 00:11:11.780
but not so weak that it created a power vacuum. That pressure might exploit.

181
00:11:12.000 --> 00:11:16.940
So the teamed up with castle and got TRO into the table's new fifth seat.

182
00:11:17.200 --> 00:11:20.650
So those are our players, Matt, Nick for Austria caste for Britain,

183
00:11:20.651 --> 00:11:23.370
Frederick Wilhem II for PR Alexander,

184
00:11:23.610 --> 00:11:26.370
the first for Russia and taro for France.

185
00:11:26.990 --> 00:11:30.970
Now all of them wanted very different things and all of them held the fate of

186
00:11:30.971 --> 00:11:33.290
Europe in their hands.

187
00:11:33.670 --> 00:11:37.450
As the entourages of these great men descended on Vienna in the fall of 18, 14,

188
00:11:37.451 --> 00:11:42.440
the pendulum of history. It could have swung in any one of a trillion ways.

189
00:11:42.790 --> 00:11:46.200
Luckily for the conservative action net only had a plan.

190
00:11:52.380 --> 00:11:56.480
The women's Congress of Vienna are probably conjuring images of boring dudes in

191
00:11:56.481 --> 00:12:01.080
silly clothes, sitting around tables and talking about impenetrable stuff. Well,

192
00:12:01.300 --> 00:12:03.320
you could not be more wrong.

193
00:12:03.500 --> 00:12:07.800
The Congress of Vienna was designed by MEIC to be the social events of the

194
00:12:07.801 --> 00:12:10.480
century. There were parties almost every night.

195
00:12:10.530 --> 00:12:13.750
These were glittering balls held by the glow of candlelight.

196
00:12:14.150 --> 00:12:17.910
There were excursions to the greatest salons that Imperial Vienna had to offer

197
00:12:18.250 --> 00:12:21.630
the wine. It flowed freely. There was dancing, romantic liaisons,

198
00:12:21.631 --> 00:12:22.464
drunken affairs,

199
00:12:22.610 --> 00:12:26.470
one source we've seen even claims two of the top participants nearly got in a

200
00:12:26.910 --> 00:12:30.030
dual, all of this Devery it wasn't dereliction of duty.

201
00:12:30.210 --> 00:12:32.750
It was all part of met plant. I remember that the,

202
00:12:32.751 --> 00:12:36.900
before he was Austrian foreign minister met Nick was a womanizing party animal

203
00:12:37.160 --> 00:12:39.740
in Vienna. So this was kind of his territory.

204
00:12:39.880 --> 00:12:44.660
He was the master of the quiet conversation over cigars in Amoy club of the

205
00:12:44.690 --> 00:12:49.620
well placed word on the dance floor of buttering someone up over wine as the

206
00:12:49.621 --> 00:12:54.450
great men of history drank and danced and seduced their air across a met Nick

207
00:12:54.451 --> 00:12:59.250
was working the crowd like a Silicon valley hotshot. He had the perfect allies.

208
00:12:59.530 --> 00:13:02.770
His endeavor Tran was even more of a social butterfly than met.

209
00:13:03.050 --> 00:13:04.770
Nick was while they had their differences.

210
00:13:04.771 --> 00:13:08.930
The two were able to deploy a joint charm offensive to make sure that Russia and

211
00:13:09.130 --> 00:13:11.970
PR didn't demand that France be carved up.

212
00:13:12.650 --> 00:13:15.640
Cast Ray was even better while he wasn't a total bro.

213
00:13:15.820 --> 00:13:17.360
He was representing Britain,

214
00:13:17.500 --> 00:13:22.360
the country with the deepest pockets in the world and caste who saw II with

215
00:13:22.560 --> 00:13:23.840
met Nick on many major issues.

216
00:13:23.841 --> 00:13:28.680
Wasn't afraid to splash London's cash to get what he wanted by February of

217
00:13:28.840 --> 00:13:30.680
1815, the final shape of the Congress.

218
00:13:30.780 --> 00:13:35.070
It was clearly visible Alexander's plans to liberate the polls had been bought

219
00:13:35.170 --> 00:13:39.270
off by offering him a chunk of Polands while pressure had agreed to make due

220
00:13:39.271 --> 00:13:41.590
with just a three fifths of SNY France.

221
00:13:41.591 --> 00:13:45.750
Meanwhile was to be pushed back into its pre revolutionary borders, smaller,

222
00:13:46.330 --> 00:13:50.230
but still powerful. The holy Roman empire would be replaced with 39 states,

223
00:13:50.231 --> 00:13:54.470
collectively known as the German Confederation with Austria at its head.

224
00:13:54.990 --> 00:13:56.740
And naturally there were other outcomes too,

225
00:13:56.741 --> 00:14:00.900
including a guarantee of Swiss neutrality and a commitment to free trade along.

226
00:14:00.901 --> 00:14:03.820
Europe's rivers clause cherished by castle Ray.

227
00:14:03.960 --> 00:14:08.060
But the big headline news was the establishments of the Congress system.

228
00:14:08.210 --> 00:14:12.340
Spearheaded by met this new system would commit Europe's great powers to meeting

229
00:14:12.341 --> 00:14:16.170
every year to discuss events and hopefully void war.

230
00:14:16.350 --> 00:14:20.090
It also committed Europe's powers to supporting Mons and empires over

231
00:14:20.290 --> 00:14:21.130
nationalist movements.

232
00:14:21.280 --> 00:14:24.690
This was perhaps Meta's biggest contribution to world history.

233
00:14:25.210 --> 00:14:28.530
MEIC deeply believed that most Europeans were natural conservatives who

234
00:14:28.560 --> 00:14:31.850
preferred order and safety over the madness of revolution.

235
00:14:32.070 --> 00:14:36.560
And now everyone was agreeing with him. The Europe that emerged the Congress.

236
00:14:36.660 --> 00:14:38.360
It wasn't just some shiny new thing,

237
00:14:38.361 --> 00:14:42.440
but it was a place governed by king by family. And by God,

238
00:14:42.670 --> 00:14:47.160
this was everything that met. Nick had wanted at least in the broader sense,

239
00:14:47.500 --> 00:14:48.800
but before he got it,

240
00:14:48.850 --> 00:14:53.600
there was one last nightmare to live through on March the seventh, 18,

241
00:14:53.840 --> 00:14:56.480
14, meta Nick was woken by an aid with some terrible news,

242
00:14:56.540 --> 00:15:00.960
not just for meta Nick, but the entire Congress Napoleon had escaped elder.

243
00:15:01.260 --> 00:15:04.520
Not only that he was on his way back to France and the French people,

244
00:15:05.120 --> 00:15:06.320
they were rallying to his cause.

245
00:15:06.750 --> 00:15:10.910
Such news could only mean one thing and that's that it was time for war.

246
00:15:11.260 --> 00:15:12.093
Once again,

247
00:15:18.180 --> 00:15:22.390
When the news of Napoleon's escape reached the Congress panic hit within days,

248
00:15:22.670 --> 00:15:25.110
met, was making plans to depart Vienna in France.

249
00:15:25.130 --> 00:15:28.230
The news caused the restored Louis the 18th to flee the country.

250
00:15:28.570 --> 00:15:32.380
It was like waking from a nightmare to find out that your still dreaming Europe

251
00:15:32.400 --> 00:15:36.620
was almost paralyzed by the fear that Napoleon's return would be even worse in

252
00:15:36.740 --> 00:15:40.140
his first reign. Luckily, things didn't quite work out like that.

253
00:15:40.280 --> 00:15:44.020
The period of Napoleon's return is known as the hundred days because, uh,

254
00:15:44.021 --> 00:15:47.220
that's roughly how long it lasted by June the 18th, 1815,

255
00:15:47.240 --> 00:15:50.940
the seventh coalition had forced the battle of water loop there. The British,

256
00:15:50.960 --> 00:15:54.690
the Russian, they defeated Napoleon once. And for all back in the end,

257
00:15:54.691 --> 00:15:58.890
the Congress actually hadn't had time to disband by the time of Waterloo netic

258
00:15:58.891 --> 00:16:00.090
himself was still in the city.

259
00:16:00.280 --> 00:16:04.130
This turned out to be fortunate when Prusa and Russia demanded France,

260
00:16:04.490 --> 00:16:08.770
be made to pay for the latest insult netic marshalled all of his charm to make

261
00:16:08.771 --> 00:16:12.840
sure that the Congress' outcome remained the same as in February, remarkably,

262
00:16:13.000 --> 00:16:15.960
the a hundred days, they changed almost nothing in July 18, 15,

263
00:16:15.961 --> 00:16:19.080
the Congress of Vienna. It finally disbanded with it,

264
00:16:19.110 --> 00:16:20.960
went to the era of revolution.

265
00:16:21.260 --> 00:16:25.880
The era of Napoleon and its place came. The age of met.

266
00:16:26.700 --> 00:16:28.480
It was during this new ages.

267
00:16:28.481 --> 00:16:32.360
Europe was cautiously settling into a life without war that met,

268
00:16:32.570 --> 00:16:35.030
became known as the Coachman of Europe.

269
00:16:35.260 --> 00:16:38.870
Certainly he was in the driver's seat on many occasions in 1819,

270
00:16:38.871 --> 00:16:42.510
he headed the Carlsbad conference that committed the German Confederation to

271
00:16:42.511 --> 00:16:44.150
cracking down hard on freedom of speech,

272
00:16:44.151 --> 00:16:48.230
repressing liberal national movements and monitoring universities for edition.

273
00:16:48.450 --> 00:16:51.110
He also headed a string of great power conferences,

274
00:16:51.370 --> 00:16:55.860
so successful worthy that the first mate met chancellor of Austria.

275
00:16:56.050 --> 00:17:00.620
However, it wasn't all roses for Europe's new driver met wasn't an idiot.

276
00:17:00.800 --> 00:17:04.940
He knew history was turning in favor of national movements and he hoped to nip

277
00:17:04.941 --> 00:17:06.260
them in the butt back.

278
00:17:06.660 --> 00:17:10.020
Me actually drew up a plan for Austria's many ethnic groups to get their own

279
00:17:10.021 --> 00:17:13.460
parliament. He hopes that giving the Hungarians checks Italians,

280
00:17:13.990 --> 00:17:18.450
so on a shred of autonomy would inoculate Austria against further revolution,

281
00:17:18.710 --> 00:17:21.370
but Francis shot him down essentially saying, yeah, man,

282
00:17:21.650 --> 00:17:23.890
I loved your secret police. And you know,

283
00:17:23.910 --> 00:17:26.370
the crushing of free speech and all that great stuff,

284
00:17:26.390 --> 00:17:28.930
but go what's with all your national pride for Hungarians,

285
00:17:29.150 --> 00:17:33.290
nobody wants that still MEIC remains a big figure on the world's stage.

286
00:17:33.400 --> 00:17:36.920
Even when it's Congress system broke down over in arguments with Britain about

287
00:17:36.921 --> 00:17:41.400
Greek revolution, people clung to the basic ideas that had outlined in Vienna.

288
00:17:41.580 --> 00:17:45.800
In fact, by the 1830s, they were clinging harder than ever on July the 27th,

289
00:17:46.440 --> 00:17:46.560
1830,

290
00:17:46.560 --> 00:17:50.800
a three day rebellion broke out in France that overthrew the restored Royals and

291
00:17:50.801 --> 00:17:53.640
replaced them with the July monarchy belly. A month later,

292
00:17:53.641 --> 00:17:57.240
Belgium exploded in a national uprising against the Netherlands.

293
00:17:57.390 --> 00:17:58.760
Just three months after that,

294
00:17:58.761 --> 00:18:02.880
the polls also went into rebellion against their Russian LORs and then 1831

295
00:18:02.881 --> 00:18:03.760
rolled arounds and,

296
00:18:04.080 --> 00:18:07.560
and Italian uprising forced the Austrians into armed intervention.

297
00:18:07.940 --> 00:18:10.550
For those who who'd started to doubt MEIC system,

298
00:18:10.551 --> 00:18:15.550
the multiple revolutions of 1830 to 1831 were a bit of a wake up call the rulers

299
00:18:15.551 --> 00:18:19.830
of Europe. They clamped down hard on nationalist feelings, which must have left.

300
00:18:20.430 --> 00:18:24.110
MEIC feeling rather vindicated, but the revolutions could be seen in other way,

301
00:18:24.170 --> 00:18:24.391
too.

302
00:18:24.391 --> 00:18:28.350
They could be seen as a sign that MEIC system was not built a top firm grounds,

303
00:18:28.750 --> 00:18:31.020
but that was, has built atop a rumbling volcano.

304
00:18:31.320 --> 00:18:35.180
It would only be a matter of time before that volcano exploded.

305
00:18:41.530 --> 00:18:44.300
Even as Metanx statue grew on the world stage,

306
00:18:44.360 --> 00:18:48.220
she was starting to slip into the Twilight of his career at home in the

307
00:18:48.221 --> 00:18:52.770
Vietnamese quarter dash new liberal Bohemian prince Fran Anton graph Von

308
00:18:53.370 --> 00:18:58.250
Cora was suddenly the rising star making MEIC look clumsy and slow

309
00:18:58.310 --> 00:18:59.410
and reactionary.

310
00:19:00.090 --> 00:19:03.930
Metanx vanity was so offended by this that he started claiming every major

311
00:19:04.150 --> 00:19:08.090
policy initiative in Austria as his own, even the bad ones,

312
00:19:08.390 --> 00:19:10.920
not the MEIC made many good sees himself though.

313
00:19:10.950 --> 00:19:13.040
Take the issue of succession Francis.

314
00:19:13.260 --> 00:19:17.400
The First's eldest son Fe end was known by everyone to be intellectually

315
00:19:17.640 --> 00:19:17.940
disabled,

316
00:19:17.940 --> 00:19:21.760
to the point of being unable to rule Francis had daughters and he had other

317
00:19:22.030 --> 00:19:23.640
sons, all of whom could have succeeded him,

318
00:19:23.641 --> 00:19:27.440
but tame Nick was such a stickler for old fashioned eldest son only succession

319
00:19:27.441 --> 00:19:31.750
that he actually talked Francis into, not Ussing over Fe end.

320
00:19:32.010 --> 00:19:35.150
And so it was that on March the second, 1835 Fe end,

321
00:19:35.151 --> 00:19:37.230
the first ascended to the Austrian throne.

322
00:19:37.410 --> 00:19:42.230
Anyone hoping for a reformist ruler instead got a guy who simply couldn't rule

323
00:19:42.690 --> 00:19:43.231
as the years,

324
00:19:43.231 --> 00:19:48.190
dragged by meta X choices went from annoying to actively embarrassing in the

325
00:19:48.191 --> 00:19:48.951
late 1830s.

326
00:19:48.951 --> 00:19:52.660
He tried to revive as congresses to no about the great powers they wanted to get

327
00:19:52.900 --> 00:19:55.660
involved. Europe may have been shaped by met system,

328
00:19:55.661 --> 00:19:58.380
but it sures heck didn't want to be ruled by him.

329
00:19:58.640 --> 00:20:01.740
Not that all the things making met unpopular were his fault though.

330
00:20:02.100 --> 00:20:04.340
The fam in this script, Europe in the 1840s, for example,

331
00:20:04.580 --> 00:20:08.100
or the financial panic that tipped part of the consonance into recession.

332
00:20:08.210 --> 00:20:09.620
What was Mets fault though?

333
00:20:09.680 --> 00:20:12.810
Was the secret police network that was watching everyone at home.

334
00:20:12.990 --> 00:20:14.570
It was arresting people for dissent,

335
00:20:14.571 --> 00:20:17.410
giving them nowhere to air legitimate grievances.

336
00:20:17.560 --> 00:20:20.690
Instead the people had to bottle everything up. Every P of hunger,

337
00:20:21.060 --> 00:20:24.890
every miserable indignity. It was a recipe that was ripe for disaster.

338
00:20:25.110 --> 00:20:29.650
All it needed was an outside shock and everything was gonna come crashing down.

339
00:20:29.990 --> 00:20:33.720
And in 1848, that shock finally came.

340
00:20:39.500 --> 00:20:43.760
If you study 19th century European history or better just watch our videos on

341
00:20:43.761 --> 00:20:44.840
the subject. That's good too.

342
00:20:45.320 --> 00:20:49.640
1848 is the year that you'll keep coming back to because that's the year that

343
00:20:49.641 --> 00:20:54.160
everything kind of went bananas. It started on February the 23rd that day,

344
00:20:54.200 --> 00:20:58.160
a French government ban on holding banquets triggered a revolution that toppled

345
00:20:58.220 --> 00:21:02.320
the July monarchy, the crash with which the king fell was enough to bring met.

346
00:21:02.560 --> 00:21:06.280
Nick tumbling down to I now met Nick had been in power for nearly 40 years.

347
00:21:06.690 --> 00:21:10.350
He was a symbol of everything that was old and cautious and conservative in

348
00:21:10.351 --> 00:21:13.630
Europe. So when news of the latest French revolution reached Vienna,

349
00:21:13.690 --> 00:21:18.550
it made everyone hope that Austria could change two within days of the July,

350
00:21:18.551 --> 00:21:21.630
monarchies collapse petitions were circulating through Vienna, demanding,

351
00:21:21.631 --> 00:21:24.910
liberalization, these petitions, they weren't calling the Meta's head.

352
00:21:24.911 --> 00:21:28.700
They just wanted an end to his system. But since under that system,

353
00:21:28.720 --> 00:21:30.700
the act of signing a petition was illegal.

354
00:21:31.460 --> 00:21:35.340
MEIC demanded all the tens of thousands of people who put their names down to be

355
00:21:35.500 --> 00:21:39.100
arrested. So you know that old phrase to shoot yourself through the foot. Well,

356
00:21:39.210 --> 00:21:43.780
this was methane accidentally blowing his own head off the short version

357
00:21:44.080 --> 00:21:47.970
of what happened next is that Vienna's poor liberal students decided to protest

358
00:21:48.110 --> 00:21:51.210
the government's crackdown on March the 13th, 1848.

359
00:21:51.290 --> 00:21:55.050
A huge crowd gathered in the city, met Nick demanded that the crowds be crushed.

360
00:21:55.230 --> 00:21:56.810
The government's anti-me faction,

361
00:21:57.330 --> 00:22:01.050
counseled peace with the results that it was decided to not crush the crowds,

362
00:22:01.051 --> 00:22:03.610
but maybe just squash them just a little,

363
00:22:04.250 --> 00:22:07.250
whatever the correct matter for the cavalry was sent in at exactly the wrong

364
00:22:07.730 --> 00:22:10.880
strength wrong because there weren't enough of them to disperse the crowd or

365
00:22:11.320 --> 00:22:13.640
really do anything except for spark a panic.

366
00:22:13.940 --> 00:22:17.800
The panicked crowd attacked the cavalry who fought back killing five students.

367
00:22:17.980 --> 00:22:22.440
The firefighter triggered mass insurrection and the civil guard were called in.

368
00:22:22.441 --> 00:22:24.200
Unfortunately the civil guard took one,

369
00:22:24.201 --> 00:22:25.960
look at the unfolding revolution and decided,

370
00:22:26.020 --> 00:22:28.990
decide with the revolutionaries with the city.

371
00:22:29.170 --> 00:22:34.150
Now in revolt MEIC was given until 9:00 PM to resign at first

372
00:22:34.630 --> 00:22:36.830
MEIC he refused, but as the clock ticked down,

373
00:22:36.850 --> 00:22:39.630
the situation got really ugly reality.

374
00:22:39.660 --> 00:22:43.630
Finally dawned on the aging chancellor just before the stroke of nine,

375
00:22:44.110 --> 00:22:47.670
MEIC announced his resignation the next day, March the 14th, 1848.

376
00:22:47.890 --> 00:22:50.940
He fled to exile in London. And with that,

377
00:22:51.400 --> 00:22:54.220
the age of MEIC was over the next two years though.

378
00:22:54.221 --> 00:22:57.420
They were crazy as MEIC watched impotently from England's Virgin.

379
00:22:57.700 --> 00:23:00.700
And the first was overthrown and replaced with emperor France. Joseph,

380
00:23:00.920 --> 00:23:04.180
the Hungarians and Italians went into rebellion and pressures.

381
00:23:04.181 --> 00:23:06.780
Liberals revolted. When the dust finally settled though,

382
00:23:07.040 --> 00:23:11.890
one thing was absolutely fair. Some how against all ODS MEIC system,

383
00:23:12.230 --> 00:23:13.890
it was still standing. Yep.

384
00:23:13.910 --> 00:23:17.170
The revolutions of 1848 basically failed the old order.

385
00:23:17.190 --> 00:23:18.650
It was restored across the continent.

386
00:23:19.000 --> 00:23:23.090
Even France simply replaced the July monarchy with the dictatorship of Napoleon

387
00:23:23.240 --> 00:23:27.050
thei in 1851, MEOC was even allowed to return to Vienna.

388
00:23:27.230 --> 00:23:31.800
It was the triumph of sorts and the old statesman soon back in the corridors of

389
00:23:31.801 --> 00:23:35.160
power, but time was no longer on its side. On June, the 11th,

390
00:23:35.440 --> 00:23:40.400
1859 Metanx health gave out. He passed away in Vienna age, 86,

391
00:23:40.660 --> 00:23:43.600
but while met, the man was gone. This is to be created,

392
00:23:43.601 --> 00:23:47.280
would stay in place for another 60 years in various guises,

393
00:23:47.520 --> 00:23:50.440
met blueprints for Europe. It remained in dual world war. I,

394
00:23:50.580 --> 00:23:54.920
it also succeeded in its mission to keep the peace between the Congress of

395
00:23:55.160 --> 00:23:56.400
Vienna and world war I,

396
00:23:56.700 --> 00:24:00.240
the biggest war fought in mainland Europe was the Franco Prussian war compared

397
00:24:00.241 --> 00:24:03.080
to the Napoleonic war saw world war I war, world war II.

398
00:24:03.800 --> 00:24:05.870
It was peanuts for all his faults.

399
00:24:06.110 --> 00:24:10.270
Met was a man who built something that lasted. He may have been vain repressive,

400
00:24:10.271 --> 00:24:12.310
and sometimes effectively stupid,

401
00:24:12.650 --> 00:24:17.030
but he was still the man who sat in Europe's driving seat for decades for better

402
00:24:17.050 --> 00:24:20.670
or worse. Our world would be very different without him.

403
00:24:20.970 --> 00:24:23.110
