00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:01.260
<v 0>Just before we get started,</v>

2
00:00:01.261 --> 00:00:04.290
I do want to mention another channels that I host called mega projects and mega

3
00:00:04.291 --> 00:00:08.100
projects. This is a channel all about mankind's greatest achievements,

4
00:00:08.101 --> 00:00:11.340
where I take a deep look at incredible buildings, project structures,

5
00:00:11.370 --> 00:00:14.400
and more whether it's the world's most impressive skyscrapers,

6
00:00:14.670 --> 00:00:18.630
the international space station Trenoble sarcophagus. I cover it.

7
00:00:18.631 --> 00:00:21.450
All new videos come out a couple of times a week on mega projects.

8
00:00:21.930 --> 00:00:24.810
Think it could be for you. Please do go head over and subscribe.

9
00:00:24.811 --> 00:00:27.750
There is a link in the description below, and let's get into it.

10
00:00:32.360 --> 00:00:33.193
<v 1>[Inaudible].</v>

11
00:00:34.250 --> 00:00:34.971
<v 0>An Island nation.</v>

12
00:00:34.971 --> 00:00:38.240
You would figure that great Britain would have its fair share of Naval heroes

13
00:00:38.241 --> 00:00:40.220
after all the wooden walls.

14
00:00:40.310 --> 00:00:43.970
If the Royal Navy protected the nation from invasion by various unfriendly,

15
00:00:43.971 --> 00:00:46.520
continental neighbors for hundreds of years,

16
00:00:46.521 --> 00:00:51.410
and then projected British strength across a globe spanning empire that the sun

17
00:00:51.411 --> 00:00:55.580
never sat on. But if you asked who the greatest of Britain's Naval heroes are,

18
00:00:55.760 --> 00:00:57.800
most people would give you the same answer.

19
00:00:57.860 --> 00:00:59.630
The humble son of an Anglican priest,

20
00:00:59.900 --> 00:01:04.700
our ratio Nelson Rose to the rank of vice Admiral while confounding and taking

21
00:01:05.270 --> 00:01:08.900
apart the French and Spanish navies sent against him becoming one of the most

22
00:01:08.901 --> 00:01:10.910
famous men in the world. In the process,

23
00:01:10.970 --> 00:01:15.260
he did everything he could do to encourage that fame relishing in his own

24
00:01:15.261 --> 00:01:19.430
success. But he was also genuinely beloved by the people who knew him well.

25
00:01:19.431 --> 00:01:21.950
And particularly the sailors who served under him.

26
00:01:22.010 --> 00:01:26.000
His style of leadership is cited today in business and military leadership

27
00:01:26.030 --> 00:01:28.280
courses as being highly effective.

28
00:01:28.430 --> 00:01:32.960
Nelson's death only added to his legend killed with almost the last bullet in

29
00:01:32.961 --> 00:01:34.820
the greatest Naval battle of the age.

30
00:01:34.970 --> 00:01:38.360
And one of the most famous in world history. Once again,

31
00:01:38.390 --> 00:01:40.550
the role Navy had prevailed, frustrating,

32
00:01:40.551 --> 00:01:44.000
the invasion plans of Napoleon and keeping British soil safe.

33
00:01:44.180 --> 00:01:45.500
But the deaths of Nelson,

34
00:01:45.620 --> 00:01:50.330
a Trafalgar touched off a wave of national mourning that made people question

35
00:01:50.630 --> 00:01:53.990
if it was all worth it. But before we tell you about his death,

36
00:01:54.080 --> 00:01:56.600
let us tell you about his fascinating yeah.

37
00:01:56.770 --> 00:01:57.920
<v 1>Complicated life.</v>

38
00:02:04.180 --> 00:02:08.270
<v 0>Ratio. Nelson was born on September the 29th, 1758 in Norfolk, England.</v>

39
00:02:08.450 --> 00:02:12.350
His father Edmonds was the parish priest of the small village of Burnham thought

40
00:02:12.530 --> 00:02:16.640
his mother Catherine's brother Maury suckling was a captain in the Royal Navy.

41
00:02:16.820 --> 00:02:21.770
And younger ratio seemed destined for a Naval career from the start in 1771

42
00:02:21.771 --> 00:02:25.160
aged only 12 Nelson became a midshipman reporting to the ship,

43
00:02:25.190 --> 00:02:29.720
HMS reasonable captains by his uncle to be trained as a Naval officer.

44
00:02:29.840 --> 00:02:33.110
In those days, it was common for teenage boys to serve on Navy ships.

45
00:02:33.260 --> 00:02:35.030
In the days before military academies,

46
00:02:35.031 --> 00:02:38.690
it was figured that the best teacher would be officers was firsthand.

47
00:02:38.691 --> 00:02:42.530
Experience has only career was helped along by his uncle who ensured that he was

48
00:02:42.531 --> 00:02:45.410
continually transferred to ships that were to see active service.

49
00:02:45.530 --> 00:02:50.000
So that Nelson rapidly gains more experience than his peers and was promoted

50
00:02:50.001 --> 00:02:51.800
quicker. In 1777,

51
00:02:51.801 --> 00:02:54.980
he was promoted to leftenants and was assigned to HMS Laos staff,

52
00:02:55.130 --> 00:02:57.110
which was about to sail to Jamaica.

53
00:02:57.440 --> 00:02:58.273
<v 1>And to war</v>

54
00:03:04.780 --> 00:03:05.613
[inaudible].

55
00:03:05.690 --> 00:03:07.260
<v 0>All of the 13 colonies of America.</v>

56
00:03:07.261 --> 00:03:11.160
It quickly blossomed into a worldwide war with the entry of France and Spain

57
00:03:11.161 --> 00:03:14.010
into the conflict on the side of the Americans, the Caribbean,

58
00:03:14.250 --> 00:03:15.870
where ships from all four belligerence,

59
00:03:15.871 --> 00:03:18.690
routinely sails was a hotbed of Naval activity.

60
00:03:19.290 --> 00:03:22.410
Nelson spent the next two years taking prizes, capturing enemy ships.

61
00:03:22.411 --> 00:03:25.440
The value of which was awarded to the ship's crew, his prize money,

62
00:03:25.620 --> 00:03:29.580
all the while being given more and more responsibility as his obvious talents

63
00:03:29.581 --> 00:03:34.140
became apparent. He was promoted to captain in 1779 and in early 17,

64
00:03:34.141 --> 00:03:38.190
80 Nelson captured a Spanish held Fort on the San Juan river in Nicaragua.

65
00:03:38.430 --> 00:03:40.500
His first significant military achievements.

66
00:03:40.620 --> 00:03:44.700
His career was temporarily stalled when he was struck ill with malaria and was

67
00:03:44.701 --> 00:03:45.810
forced to return to Britain,

68
00:03:45.811 --> 00:03:50.520
to recover Nelson soon returns to active duty and command of the HMS album mall,

69
00:03:50.550 --> 00:03:54.300
which he commanded up and down the American coast until the war ended in an

70
00:03:54.301 --> 00:03:58.680
American victory in 1783, after the war Nelson was sent to the Caribbean.

71
00:03:58.830 --> 00:04:00.720
So act as a sort of policeman seizing,

72
00:04:00.870 --> 00:04:04.440
any American ships that attempted to trade with British colonial islands,

73
00:04:04.441 --> 00:04:06.930
which was illegal under the navigation acts.

74
00:04:07.110 --> 00:04:09.900
It was during this time that he met Francis Fannie Nesbith.

75
00:04:10.050 --> 00:04:14.820
So widow who lived on a plantation on the Island of Nevis Nelson was smitten and

76
00:04:15.140 --> 00:04:17.520
her uncle offered him he large dowery to marry her.

77
00:04:17.640 --> 00:04:21.360
It wasn't until after they were engaged that Nelson discovered the dowry was a

78
00:04:21.361 --> 00:04:21.840
fiction.

79
00:04:21.840 --> 00:04:25.020
The family wasn't worth anywhere near as much as they had claimed to make

80
00:04:25.021 --> 00:04:25.854
matters. Worse.

81
00:04:25.890 --> 00:04:28.920
Fannie had hit on the fact that she was in fertile and capable of having

82
00:04:28.921 --> 00:04:31.020
children until after they were engaged,

83
00:04:31.140 --> 00:04:33.930
breaking off the engagement would have been dishonorable for an English

84
00:04:34.410 --> 00:04:38.100
gentleman. So Nelson had no choice, but to go ahead with the wedding in 1787,

85
00:04:38.160 --> 00:04:40.680
the deception had soured the romance, however,

86
00:04:40.860 --> 00:04:44.850
and Nelson and Fanny would become more and more estranged as time passed.

87
00:04:50.820 --> 00:04:51.170
<v 1>[Inaudible].</v>

88
00:04:51.170 --> 00:04:54.420
<v 0>In 1788, Nelson was sent home to Britain and for five years,</v>

89
00:04:54.421 --> 00:04:57.570
he languished on shore without a command with no water flights.

90
00:04:57.810 --> 00:05:00.540
That simply weren't enough ships to go round in the peacetime Navy.

91
00:05:00.541 --> 00:05:05.040
And so Nelson was kept in reserve on half pay and had absolutely nothing to do,

92
00:05:05.041 --> 00:05:07.860
but to tend to his affairs at home while continually badgering,

93
00:05:07.861 --> 00:05:11.880
anyone he knew for a command, he got his chance in late 1792,

94
00:05:11.881 --> 00:05:15.480
when the French revolutionary government eager to flex its mites to its

95
00:05:15.481 --> 00:05:18.780
neighbors annex the Austrian Netherlands modern day Belgium,

96
00:05:18.810 --> 00:05:21.330
which had traditionally been kept as a buffer state,

97
00:05:21.570 --> 00:05:25.350
the move heightened tensions between Britain and France and in preparation for

98
00:05:25.351 --> 00:05:28.020
war, the role Navy calls back its reserve offices,

99
00:05:28.200 --> 00:05:30.900
including Nelson in January, 1793,

100
00:05:30.930 --> 00:05:35.400
soon after France declared war and Nelson's ship sail to Gibraltar in may as

101
00:05:35.401 --> 00:05:38.760
part of a fleet determined to establish British Naval supremacy in the

102
00:05:38.761 --> 00:05:42.330
Mediterranean. The flashpoints of the area was the French city of tuna,

103
00:05:42.360 --> 00:05:46.860
which was held by French royalists, but came under attack by the revolutionary.

104
00:05:47.220 --> 00:05:49.560
Jacob ans the city appealed to the Royal Navy for help,

105
00:05:49.590 --> 00:05:53.580
but eventually a launch Republican force occupied the Hills around the city and

106
00:05:53.581 --> 00:05:55.380
began to bombard it into submission.

107
00:05:55.500 --> 00:05:59.180
The itinerary officer in charge of bombardment was a young man named Napoleon

108
00:05:59.181 --> 00:05:59.990
Bonaparte.

109
00:05:59.990 --> 00:06:04.100
And so this was to be the start of his own military success story though.

110
00:06:04.160 --> 00:06:08.270
No one knew it at the time. So it all fell in December and seeking a Naval base,

111
00:06:08.271 --> 00:06:09.380
close to the French coast.

112
00:06:09.560 --> 00:06:13.160
The fleet commander ordered Nelson to blockade the French controlled Island of

113
00:06:13.161 --> 00:06:16.910
Corsica followed by an invasion in February, 1794.

114
00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:18.890
After the army proved reluctant to proceed,

115
00:06:19.040 --> 00:06:22.910
Nelson himself was put in command of the land forces and helped capture the city

116
00:06:22.911 --> 00:06:23.660
of Bastianich.

117
00:06:23.660 --> 00:06:27.200
He played an important role in ground operations for the remainder of the course

118
00:06:27.201 --> 00:06:27.951
of human campaign,

119
00:06:27.951 --> 00:06:32.030
using canons offloaded from Naval ships to bombard enemy positions on July the

120
00:06:32.031 --> 00:06:32.420
12th,

121
00:06:32.420 --> 00:06:36.230
Nelson was wounded by debris from an artillery rounds that excluded no one of

122
00:06:36.231 --> 00:06:39.080
his batteries, but wound eventually it cost him his sight.

123
00:06:39.640 --> 00:06:40.473
<v 1>Hi.</v>

124
00:06:46.750 --> 00:06:47.560
<v 0>Sure. Of course,</v>

125
00:06:47.560 --> 00:06:50.950
Nelson spent the next three years engaged in operations in the Mediterranean.

126
00:06:51.130 --> 00:06:52.810
And so French victories in Italy,

127
00:06:53.350 --> 00:06:56.860
head of an army commander by Napoleon forced the Royal Navy to leave their base

128
00:06:56.861 --> 00:07:00.670
in Corsica and sail to Gibraltar in December, 1796,

129
00:07:00.730 --> 00:07:04.150
Nelson was on the way to join them on February the first 1797,

130
00:07:04.151 --> 00:07:05.500
when quite by accident,

131
00:07:05.650 --> 00:07:09.490
it happens upon the Spanish fleet that had left Carter Haino Renta was headed

132
00:07:09.491 --> 00:07:13.480
South to the port of kudus to eventually link up with their French allies.

133
00:07:13.540 --> 00:07:18.160
Nelson's ship on scene in the fog escapes to alert the fleet commander and

134
00:07:19.300 --> 00:07:22.270
John Jarvis of the Spanish movements, Jervis decided to give battle.

135
00:07:22.410 --> 00:07:26.140
And on Valentine's day, the two fleets match off of Cape St. Vincent.

136
00:07:26.230 --> 00:07:29.470
It was here that Nelson first distinguished himself in the eyes of the British

137
00:07:29.471 --> 00:07:31.840
public and commands of the HMS captain.

138
00:07:32.020 --> 00:07:36.460
He engaged three much larger Spanish ships and captured two of them by boarding

139
00:07:36.461 --> 00:07:38.140
them and engaging in vicious.

140
00:07:38.141 --> 00:07:41.710
Hand-to-hand combat the prize money from these two captured ships made Nelson

141
00:07:41.711 --> 00:07:45.070
rich, and his heroism at capes and Vincent had made him famous.

142
00:07:45.280 --> 00:07:48.910
He was now a ratio Nelson having been made and night of the bath.

143
00:07:48.911 --> 00:07:51.850
And soon after the battle, he was promoted to run.

144
00:07:58.840 --> 00:08:02.380
One of the first things Admiral Nelson did after his promotion was to oversee a

145
00:08:02.381 --> 00:08:06.400
plan to capture the city of Santa Cruz de tenor reef and the Canary islands and

146
00:08:06.401 --> 00:08:10.240
important Spanish outpost and stop over points for the Spanish treasure fleets

147
00:08:10.241 --> 00:08:11.530
returning from the Americas,

148
00:08:11.590 --> 00:08:15.250
the plan called for a simultaneous bombardments and as an amphibious landing.

149
00:08:15.370 --> 00:08:18.790
But after two aborted attempts to storm the beach on the night of July,

150
00:08:18.910 --> 00:08:23.050
the 24th, 1797 Nelson decided to lead the troops to shore itself.

151
00:08:23.110 --> 00:08:25.240
The resulting battle was a disaster for the British,

152
00:08:25.420 --> 00:08:29.140
the Spanish defenders were well dug in and they blasted the invading troops on

153
00:08:29.141 --> 00:08:30.340
the beach with Canon VAR.

154
00:08:30.341 --> 00:08:34.240
And musketry no sooner had Nelson gone to sharp than he was shot in the right

155
00:08:34.241 --> 00:08:36.070
arm and collapsed back into his boat.

156
00:08:36.160 --> 00:08:39.820
The basketball had smashed his humorous bone into multiple pieces and he was

157
00:08:40.300 --> 00:08:44.050
rode back to his flagship to be attended to by the surgeon that's in at the time

158
00:08:44.051 --> 00:08:46.240
period was barely out of the dark ages.

159
00:08:46.390 --> 00:08:50.350
Germ theory was still decades away and the most common way to prevent a wounded

160
00:08:50.351 --> 00:08:53.890
limb from getting gangrene and killing the victim was to amputate us.

161
00:08:53.980 --> 00:08:57.000
Most of Nelson's right arm was sliced off and thrown overboard.

162
00:08:57.090 --> 00:09:00.090
Most of the British force didn't fare much better when they withdrew the next

163
00:09:00.091 --> 00:09:02.310
day 250 had been killed.

164
00:09:02.311 --> 00:09:06.720
And there's another 128 wounded Nelson was despondent both over the failure to

165
00:09:06.721 --> 00:09:08.820
capture Santa Cruz. And by the loss of his arm,

166
00:09:09.060 --> 00:09:12.210
he wrote to the commanding Admiral of the Mediterranean fleets that he intended

167
00:09:12.211 --> 00:09:15.450
to return home to England and dress higher. As in his words,

168
00:09:15.630 --> 00:09:19.050
a left-handed Admiral will never again be considered useful.

169
00:09:25.310 --> 00:09:29.630
Nelson remains in England for several months recuperating, but in March, 1798,

170
00:09:29.810 --> 00:09:30.710
he went to sea again,

171
00:09:30.711 --> 00:09:34.820
having been convinced that the Royal Navy had use for one arm dad Burl off to

172
00:09:35.300 --> 00:09:37.430
Roland's that retirements didn't really suit him. Anyway.

173
00:09:37.520 --> 00:09:40.790
He returned to the Mediterranean where he was given a squadron of 15 ships in

174
00:09:40.791 --> 00:09:45.020
order to too long to intercept a French fleet that was on the move in France,

175
00:09:45.050 --> 00:09:48.740
Napoleon Bonaparte had become the most important political and military figure

176
00:09:48.741 --> 00:09:49.370
in the country.

177
00:09:49.370 --> 00:09:54.050
His strategy for 1798 was to invade Egypt with a large army and Navy and thus

178
00:09:54.051 --> 00:09:56.420
bring pressure to British occupied India.

179
00:09:56.540 --> 00:10:00.020
This was in the hope that it would threaten her commercial interests and force

180
00:10:00.030 --> 00:10:01.640
great person to abandon the war.

181
00:10:01.700 --> 00:10:05.600
The Polian got away from Nelson after the British ships were blown off course by

182
00:10:05.601 --> 00:10:06.081
a storm,

183
00:10:06.081 --> 00:10:09.710
but the British soon pursued them across the Mediterranean to Alexandria.

184
00:10:09.830 --> 00:10:13.490
The French army had already won a series of victories against the ruling Mamluks

185
00:10:13.491 --> 00:10:17.360
and the French fleet was anchored off the coast of Alexandria in a Delta of the

186
00:10:17.361 --> 00:10:20.450
Nile river in a supposedly impregnable defensive position.

187
00:10:20.540 --> 00:10:23.810
But Nelson was unimpressed and moved immediately to attack.

188
00:10:24.080 --> 00:10:25.430
As dusk fell on August.

189
00:10:25.431 --> 00:10:28.640
The first the British ships fell upon the stationary friendships.

190
00:10:28.670 --> 00:10:32.330
The French Admiral Dobros had figured that the Shoals on the flanks of his

191
00:10:32.331 --> 00:10:36.080
battle line would prevent the British from getting onto his star board right

192
00:10:36.081 --> 00:10:39.680
side and the dust surrounding him. So all of his sailors were ordered to man,

193
00:10:39.710 --> 00:10:44.420
the port left side cannons butts Nelson's lead ships found a gap in the Shoals

194
00:10:44.421 --> 00:10:48.080
and suddenly the French found themselves under attack from both sides,

195
00:10:48.320 --> 00:10:49.190
darkness fell,

196
00:10:49.220 --> 00:10:53.120
but the scene was illuminated by the battle raging in the Nile Delta cannons.

197
00:10:53.150 --> 00:10:56.990
Belched out flames from all sides and started several fires,

198
00:10:56.991 --> 00:10:59.480
including one that's in Gulf with the French flagship Loreal.

199
00:10:59.750 --> 00:11:03.230
This exploded when the flames reached the gunpowder magazine killing Admiral to

200
00:11:03.680 --> 00:11:06.320
braise, Admiral Nelson was wounded for the third time in his Korea,

201
00:11:06.410 --> 00:11:08.450
a flesh wounds that he quickly had bandaged.

202
00:11:08.451 --> 00:11:11.960
And then he returns to oversee the battle overwhelmed by the amounts of British

203
00:11:12.410 --> 00:11:13.280
cannons, brought to bear on them.

204
00:11:13.281 --> 00:11:16.730
The friendships began to surrender as Dawn broke on August. The second,

205
00:11:16.760 --> 00:11:20.660
the battle was for all intents and purposes over the French fleet was completely

206
00:11:20.661 --> 00:11:25.100
destroyed out of 17 ships that began the battle four were banned and nine were

207
00:11:25.101 --> 00:11:29.180
captured. The French suffered 3,500 casualties to the British 900.

208
00:11:29.330 --> 00:11:31.970
The battle has great strategic consequences for the war.

209
00:11:32.120 --> 00:11:35.810
It traps Napoleon's army in Egypt forcing the general to return to France

210
00:11:35.840 --> 00:11:38.450
without his troops. He never trusted the Navy again,

211
00:11:38.510 --> 00:11:42.110
and this mistrust would weigh heavily in his future military decisions.

212
00:11:42.170 --> 00:11:42.711
Great Britain.

213
00:11:42.711 --> 00:11:46.880
Meanwhile had gained complete dominance of the seas around the conflict zone and

214
00:11:46.881 --> 00:11:49.100
advantage that hold for the rest of the war.

215
00:11:55.470 --> 00:11:58.920
Nelson's victory at the battle of the Nile made him a national hero heads of

216
00:11:59.220 --> 00:12:02.430
state from all over Europe sent him accolades and he reveled in the attention

217
00:12:02.520 --> 00:12:03.750
for all these many virtues.

218
00:12:03.780 --> 00:12:07.950
Nelson was rather vain and a shameless self promoter. For instance,

219
00:12:07.951 --> 00:12:10.380
when shortly afterward reached London of his victory,

220
00:12:10.381 --> 00:12:14.760
he was given the title Barron Nelson of the Nile and Nelson was insulted to

221
00:12:14.970 --> 00:12:15.120
this.

222
00:12:15.120 --> 00:12:19.650
He was only given a near Baron Mary instead of a more prestigious title shortly

223
00:12:19.651 --> 00:12:23.190
after the battle of the Nile Nelson sail to Naples to refit his squadron.

224
00:12:23.250 --> 00:12:27.870
He was fated by the Neapolitan RA court and was a guest of British ambassador.

225
00:12:27.871 --> 00:12:31.140
So William Hamilton Nelson had briefly met. So William and his wife,

226
00:12:31.170 --> 00:12:35.910
Emma in 1793, but he was a far different man. Now he was Scott.

227
00:12:36.150 --> 00:12:39.720
He was blind in one eye, missing an arm and internationally renowned.

228
00:12:39.870 --> 00:12:43.620
Emma Hamilton was 35 years younger than her husband and was considered one of

229
00:12:43.621 --> 00:12:47.100
the most beautiful and intelligent women of her day during Nelson stay in

230
00:12:47.101 --> 00:12:49.590
Naples. He and Emma felt deeply in love with each other.

231
00:12:49.591 --> 00:12:53.430
And soon we're carrying on an affair that the entire world seemed to know about.

232
00:12:53.550 --> 00:12:57.330
The strange part was that not only was it apparent that so William was aware of

233
00:12:57.331 --> 00:13:00.510
his wife's affair with Nelson, but he was surprisingly open-minded about it.

234
00:13:00.511 --> 00:13:03.180
Considering the time he lived in the three lived together in Naples.

235
00:13:03.181 --> 00:13:06.810
And when Hamilton was recalled home to England, Nelson returned as well.

236
00:13:06.811 --> 00:13:09.210
And the three set up together at a house in London,

237
00:13:09.330 --> 00:13:12.480
much to the fury of Nelson's wife, Fanny around Christmas,

238
00:13:12.481 --> 00:13:17.370
1800 funny gave her husbands and ultimatum to choose Emma or her and well

239
00:13:17.430 --> 00:13:20.100
Nelson chose his mistress. The two never lived together, right?

240
00:13:26.790 --> 00:13:27.090
<v 1>[Inaudible].</v>

241
00:13:27.090 --> 00:13:31.260
<v 0>On January the first 1801 Nelson was promoted to vice Admiral and was sent on a</v>

242
00:13:31.261 --> 00:13:33.450
new assignment to the Baltic seat. Denmark,

243
00:13:33.480 --> 00:13:37.500
tired of Britain blockading her ports to stop French trade had allied itself

244
00:13:37.501 --> 00:13:39.450
with Prussia, Sweden, and Russia.

245
00:13:39.600 --> 00:13:43.200
In order to break the blockade of the Royal Navy Nelson was sent as part of a

246
00:13:43.201 --> 00:13:46.050
fleet to do break up this league of arms neutrality.

247
00:13:46.260 --> 00:13:48.510
This threatens British Naval supremacy in Europe,

248
00:13:48.540 --> 00:13:51.020
Nelson convinced his superior Admiral pockets.

249
00:13:51.120 --> 00:13:54.690
You allow him to take a dozen ships of the line into Copenhagen Harbor and

250
00:13:54.840 --> 00:13:58.230
attack the Danish fleas before they had time to join up with the Swedish and

251
00:13:58.231 --> 00:14:00.720
Russian fleets Nelson attacks on April. The second,

252
00:14:00.810 --> 00:14:04.440
the battle didn't start out well for the British three ships ran a grounds early

253
00:14:04.441 --> 00:14:07.260
in the battle promising Admiral Parker to signal the retreat,

254
00:14:07.470 --> 00:14:11.280
but Nelson who had a better grasp of the situation than Ponka pocketed decided

255
00:14:11.281 --> 00:14:13.860
to continue the attack in a bit of his trademark,

256
00:14:13.861 --> 00:14:16.620
which he held up his telescope to his blind. Diane said,

257
00:14:16.890 --> 00:14:18.510
I honestly can't see the signal.

258
00:14:18.930 --> 00:14:21.930
The battle soon turned in the favor of the British as they destroyed three

259
00:14:22.230 --> 00:14:25.710
Dennis' ships and captured and burned a dozen more Nelson gold for a true

260
00:14:25.711 --> 00:14:26.130
switch.

261
00:14:26.130 --> 00:14:29.790
The Danes accepted the destruction of the Danish fleet together with the sudden

262
00:14:29.791 --> 00:14:33.420
death of saw Peter of the first of Russia Bach to the ends of the league and

263
00:14:33.570 --> 00:14:36.510
Nelson returned home to receive more accolades.

264
00:14:36.540 --> 00:14:40.860
He was now via counts Nelson of the Nile and considered the country's foremost

265
00:14:40.861 --> 00:14:44.520
Naval hero in October, 1801, great Britain and France signals.

266
00:14:44.570 --> 00:14:48.510
The peace of amnion ending the war Nelson spends the next two years in Britain

267
00:14:48.570 --> 00:14:51.680
living with William and Emma Hamilton and touring the country with him.

268
00:14:51.800 --> 00:14:53.300
Emma had given birth to a daughter.

269
00:14:53.301 --> 00:14:57.290
Her ratio that everyone knew was Nelson's illegitimate daughter runs the

270
00:14:57.291 --> 00:15:00.830
unconventional family, all lived together at a country estate and sorry.

271
00:15:00.831 --> 00:15:04.940
And also William died in April, 1803 a month later, born again,

272
00:15:04.941 --> 00:15:06.830
broke out and Nelson was back at sea.

273
00:15:13.600 --> 00:15:13.740
<v 1>[Inaudible].</v>

274
00:15:13.740 --> 00:15:16.990
<v 0>One was appointed commander of the Mediterranean fleet and given the pride of</v>

275
00:15:16.991 --> 00:15:20.560
the Royal Navy HMS victory as this flagship, these orders,

276
00:15:20.561 --> 00:15:24.070
weren't a blockade to nor the French Navy under the commands of Admiral Pierre

277
00:15:24.670 --> 00:15:26.170
Sharpeville Nerf was at Hancock.

278
00:15:26.230 --> 00:15:29.650
It was essential to keep the French ships from escaping the blockade and moving

279
00:15:29.680 --> 00:15:32.620
North to the English channel where they could help Napoleon.

280
00:15:32.650 --> 00:15:35.740
Now emperor of the French invaded great Britain for two years,

281
00:15:35.770 --> 00:15:38.920
Nelson and Villanova played a cat and mouse game with each other,

282
00:15:38.921 --> 00:15:42.070
a series of back and forth maneuvers that saw Nelson at one point,

283
00:15:42.071 --> 00:15:45.580
chase Seville nerve all the way across the Atlantic to the West Indies.

284
00:15:46.000 --> 00:15:48.160
And then back again in August, 1895,

285
00:15:48.280 --> 00:15:51.670
Nelson resounds briefly to England on leave. He was cheered everywhere.

286
00:15:51.700 --> 00:15:55.990
He went much to his delight in September word came the allied French and Spanish

287
00:15:55.991 --> 00:15:59.650
fleets have combined together at the Spanish port of CodeHS Nelson. You know,

288
00:15:59.651 --> 00:16:03.640
it was time to return to see he departed on board victory on September the 14th,

289
00:16:03.670 --> 00:16:05.500
after saying goodbye to his beloved,

290
00:16:05.501 --> 00:16:09.700
Emma Nelson arrived at CodeHS on September the 27th and spent most of the next

291
00:16:09.701 --> 00:16:13.090
month preparing for the battle. He was sure was to come. Meanwhile,

292
00:16:13.091 --> 00:16:16.420
his French counterpart felt was feeling the heat from Napoleon.

293
00:16:16.570 --> 00:16:19.900
The emperor was angry that his Admiral wouldn't engage the British fleet and

294
00:16:20.110 --> 00:16:23.320
breakouts of the blockade at cadets. He sent a replacement to Overland,

295
00:16:23.410 --> 00:16:25.120
to kudus, to take command of the fleet.

296
00:16:25.450 --> 00:16:28.510
Phil nerve in an effort to stave off the humiliation of being relieved of

297
00:16:28.511 --> 00:16:32.950
command, decided to sail out before his replacement arrived on October the 20th,

298
00:16:32.980 --> 00:16:37.270
the 33 ships of the Franco Spanish fleet sailed out of cadets were spotted as by

299
00:16:37.420 --> 00:16:38.081
British scout,

300
00:16:38.081 --> 00:16:42.670
frigates who quickly moved to inform Nelson when October the 21st Nelson moved

301
00:16:42.790 --> 00:16:46.930
as 27 ships to engage the enemy off the coast of Cape Trafalgar up as 1145,

302
00:16:47.110 --> 00:16:48.220
he prepared to engage.

303
00:16:48.310 --> 00:16:50.800
He ordered a signalman to signal the rest of the ships in the fleet.

304
00:16:51.040 --> 00:16:54.040
England expects that every man will do his duty.

305
00:16:54.250 --> 00:16:56.380
A great share went off throughout the British fleet.

306
00:16:56.470 --> 00:17:00.610
Nelson was truly beloved by the many commanders and a time when Naval officers

307
00:17:00.611 --> 00:17:02.860
were expected to be strict disciplinarians.

308
00:17:02.890 --> 00:17:07.000
The points of cruelty towards the common sailor Nelson Ghana respects with

309
00:17:07.060 --> 00:17:10.480
affection and kindness Nelson's battle plan was simple.

310
00:17:10.540 --> 00:17:13.450
He meant to close with a Franco Spanish fleet as quickly as possible,

311
00:17:13.600 --> 00:17:17.560
cuts their battle line into three pieces and engage the enemy and ship to ship

312
00:17:17.590 --> 00:17:19.150
combat, which he was sure he would be.

313
00:17:19.690 --> 00:17:22.660
Victoria sat due to the superior training is going to recruit.

314
00:17:22.720 --> 00:17:26.560
He splits his force into two squadrons. One led by himself, a board victory,

315
00:17:26.770 --> 00:17:28.600
and to the other led by his second in command.

316
00:17:28.780 --> 00:17:32.350
Admiral Collingwood bought the role sovereign with Alyssa wind to speed that

317
00:17:32.800 --> 00:17:32.810
progress.

318
00:17:32.810 --> 00:17:36.580
The British ships slowly moved towards the allied line all while on the fire

319
00:17:36.581 --> 00:17:39.700
from the French and Spanish ships. Finally, after almost an hour,

320
00:17:39.820 --> 00:17:43.630
victory passed between two friendships and fought a devastating broadside.

321
00:17:43.900 --> 00:17:46.390
Other ships followed and general Melay ensued.

322
00:17:46.450 --> 00:17:48.520
Victory found herself engaging the friendship.

323
00:17:48.521 --> 00:17:51.930
Redoubtable the French screw has largely abandoned their cannons and were

324
00:17:52.080 --> 00:17:55.890
massing on deck to try and board the Admiral's flagship until they were cut

325
00:17:55.891 --> 00:17:58.620
apart by the cannon fire of a passing British ship.

326
00:17:58.800 --> 00:18:02.640
All the while the murderous fire poured down from the redoubtable Moston rigging

327
00:18:02.641 --> 00:18:05.940
from saying the station's up there with muskets Nelson had forbidden his

328
00:18:05.941 --> 00:18:08.910
captains from doing this worried about the sails catching on fire.

329
00:18:09.190 --> 00:18:10.050
Thus unhampered,

330
00:18:10.200 --> 00:18:14.100
the front sharp shooters cars pick their targets well and Nelson standing on the

331
00:18:14.101 --> 00:18:19.050
quarter deck in his distinctive uniform made very perfect target at around 1:00

332
00:18:19.050 --> 00:18:20.100
PM an hour into the battle.

333
00:18:20.280 --> 00:18:23.910
Nelson was shot the bullets entering through his shoulder blade and severing his

334
00:18:23.911 --> 00:18:24.744
spinal cord.

335
00:18:24.930 --> 00:18:28.140
The Admiral collapsed to the DAC recognizing immediately that the wound was

336
00:18:28.141 --> 00:18:28.800
fatal.

337
00:18:28.800 --> 00:18:32.400
He was carried below deck and made comfortable as there was nothing that the

338
00:18:32.401 --> 00:18:33.270
doctor could do for him.

339
00:18:33.540 --> 00:18:36.420
Nelson live long enough to hear that yet another spectacular victory.

340
00:18:36.421 --> 00:18:40.800
It was his, the French and Spanish had lost 22 ships. The British had lost none.

341
00:18:41.040 --> 00:18:42.210
Thank God I've done.

342
00:18:42.211 --> 00:18:46.820
My duty Nelson said Admiral died at four 30 at the age of 47.

343
00:18:53.240 --> 00:18:53.730
<v 1>[Inaudible].</v>

344
00:18:53.730 --> 00:18:56.180
<v 0>Celebration of the victory of the battle of Trafalgar.</v>

345
00:18:56.270 --> 00:18:59.960
Instead the death of Admiral Nelson touched off a period of profound national

346
00:19:00.320 --> 00:19:03.440
mourning and great Britain that wouldn't be seen again until the death of

347
00:19:03.441 --> 00:19:05.840
princess. Diana, nearly 200 years later,

348
00:19:05.930 --> 00:19:09.740
Nelson's body was returned to England and given a state funeral at Simple's

349
00:19:09.741 --> 00:19:10.730
cathedral in London,

350
00:19:10.850 --> 00:19:14.540
thousands of people lined the funeral routes and packs the pews of the cathedral

351
00:19:14.541 --> 00:19:18.800
to say goodbye to their hero. One person not in attendance. However,

352
00:19:18.990 --> 00:19:19.823
was Emma Hamilton.

353
00:19:19.970 --> 00:19:23.900
Nelson had neglected to amend as well to include Emma and her ratio.

354
00:19:24.170 --> 00:19:27.770
Aaron's although he begged the country to take care of them before he died.

355
00:19:27.950 --> 00:19:32.270
Nelson's brother who inherited most of his estate was completely uninterested in

356
00:19:32.271 --> 00:19:32.870
helping her.

357
00:19:32.870 --> 00:19:36.380
The British public may have been willing to overlook Nelson's affair because of

358
00:19:36.381 --> 00:19:39.560
his status. As a national hero. After his death,

359
00:19:39.890 --> 00:19:43.310
Emma was branded and adulterer was shunned by her former friends.

360
00:19:43.520 --> 00:19:48.200
She died in 1815 at the age of 49 deeply in debt and suffering from a number of

361
00:19:48.201 --> 00:19:49.970
health problems. Her daughter with Nelson,

362
00:19:50.030 --> 00:19:55.010
a ratio lived a quiet life as a reverend's wife and raised 10 children living

363
00:19:55.011 --> 00:19:56.030
until 1881.

364
00:19:56.330 --> 00:20:00.560
Nelson had so many places and things named after him that it would be impossible

365
00:20:00.561 --> 00:20:04.280
to list them all the most famous of these is Trafalgar square in London.

366
00:20:04.310 --> 00:20:08.150
One of the most popular tourist attractions in the city located prominently in

367
00:20:08.151 --> 00:20:12.800
the square is they 145 foot 44 meter granite column topped with a

368
00:20:12.801 --> 00:20:17.360
statue of the man who will likely forever be known as Britain's most beloved

369
00:20:17.361 --> 00:20:20.750
sailor. So I really hope you found that video. Interesting. If you did,
