00:00:00.400 --> 00:00:01.480
<v 0>Here's a real scandal to consider.</v>

2
00:00:01.500 --> 00:00:05.320
Did you know that two out of every three guys would experience some for the male

3
00:00:05.600 --> 00:00:09.000
pat ball just by the time they're 35. I knew it for me,

4
00:00:09.060 --> 00:00:12.800
it was more like 25. I wish keeps been around when I was younger,

5
00:00:12.801 --> 00:00:16.320
because advancements in sign have meant that there's now treatments that can

6
00:00:16.321 --> 00:00:20.240
combat the symptoms of hair loss and help you keep the hair that you have.

7
00:00:20.660 --> 00:00:23.470
It's too late for me. My hair is not coming back,

8
00:00:23.650 --> 00:00:27.310
but you don't have to be like me. You can stop your hair loss early.

9
00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:31.990
Thanks to keeps keeps off as generic versions of the only two FDA approved drugs

10
00:00:31.991 --> 00:00:32.910
for treating hair loss.

11
00:00:33.170 --> 00:00:37.790
<v 1>So you may have tried them before, but never at a price this low that's right.</v>

12
00:00:37.791 --> 00:00:39.030
If you were thinking Simon,

13
00:00:39.031 --> 00:00:41.660
this is some sort of meds and it's gonna be expensive.

14
00:00:41.860 --> 00:00:45.660
<v 0>Well, you couldn't be more wrong. Keep starts at just $10 a month.</v>

15
00:00:45.661 --> 00:00:47.020
How does it work? Well for one thing,

16
00:00:47.021 --> 00:00:48.380
there's no need to visit a doctor's office.

17
00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:52.980
Just schedule a quick online consult and a bit later a discreet package arrives

18
00:00:52.981 --> 00:00:55.220
at your door and you can use it in the privacy of your own home.

19
00:00:55.560 --> 00:00:58.940
<v 1>So if you are noticing that you are losing your hair,</v>

20
00:00:58.941 --> 00:01:00.700
that's not a problem that's gonna fix itself,

21
00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:03.330

00:01:03.430 --> 00:01:06.130

And let's get into today's video,

25
00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:21.410
Take a secretary of state, a show girl, and a Soviet spy.

26
00:01:21.550 --> 00:01:24.120
Mix them together in the middle of the cold war.

27
00:01:24.340 --> 00:01:28.160
And you have the recipe for one of the greatest political scandals in British

28
00:01:28.190 --> 00:01:31.680
history. Today, we'll be taking a look at the perfume affair, a love triangle,

29
00:01:31.681 --> 00:01:36.120
which became front page news in every newspaper in Britain during the early

30
00:01:36.440 --> 00:01:41.000
1960s, and helps bring down the conservative government of Harold McMillan.

31
00:01:47.120 --> 00:01:50.390
<v 0>Let's take a look at the main characters involved in this scandal and see how</v>

32
00:01:50.391 --> 00:01:51.910
their lives brought them together.

33
00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:55.390
We'll start with a male protagonist of the story. John Dennis Profumo,

34
00:01:55.480 --> 00:01:57.390
since the whole thing was named after him,

35
00:01:57.391 --> 00:02:00.110
after all he was born in 1915 in Kensington London,

36
00:02:00.220 --> 00:02:03.500
part of the very rich and influential Profumo family,

37
00:02:03.550 --> 00:02:07.580
which came from Italian N ability based in the kingdom of Sarnia,

38
00:02:07.581 --> 00:02:10.100
even though John never used the title as father Al,

39
00:02:10.260 --> 00:02:13.660
but was the fourth Barron Profumo and had made a fortune in insurance,

40
00:02:13.661 --> 00:02:16.820
owning the lions share of the provide life association of London.

41
00:02:16.960 --> 00:02:17.860
Unsurprisingly,

42
00:02:17.960 --> 00:02:21.060
all the benefits of wealth were afforded to John Profumo from an early age,

43
00:02:21.061 --> 00:02:22.380
starting with his education.

44
00:02:22.640 --> 00:02:26.570
<v 1>He first went to one of the most expensive and prestigious boarding schools in</v>

45
00:02:26.571 --> 00:02:28.730
England. Afterwards he studied the university of Oxford,

46
00:02:28.780 --> 00:02:32.330
where he had a romantic twist that somewhat foreshadowed his future affair,

47
00:02:32.420 --> 00:02:34.090
which brought him no to rioty.

48
00:02:34.090 --> 00:02:37.690
<v 0>According to declassified MI five documents during the 1930s,</v>

49
00:02:37.691 --> 00:02:41.970
while still in college Profumo was in a relationship with German model Giselle

50
00:02:42.730 --> 00:02:43.970
vinegar, who was later convicted,

51
00:02:43.971 --> 00:02:48.760
a espionage 1940 was a big year for John Profumo. His father died leaving him,

52
00:02:48.780 --> 00:02:50.680
his Barnet sea and his fortune.

53
00:02:50.860 --> 00:02:55.080
He also had his first taste of political success as he had been elected as a new

54
00:02:55.081 --> 00:02:59.040
member of parliament or MP for Kettering becoming the youngest MP in house

55
00:02:59.080 --> 00:02:59.590
commons.

56
00:02:59.590 --> 00:03:04.240
Profumo had also enlisted in the war and was deployed to Africa in 1940 as part

57
00:03:04.241 --> 00:03:06.600
of the north Hampton. She yary when the war was over,

58
00:03:06.820 --> 00:03:10.280
it seems like Profumo was set up for success. He had the connections,

59
00:03:10.420 --> 00:03:11.280
the popularity,

60
00:03:11.500 --> 00:03:15.560
the support of the conservative party and the war record that could take him

61
00:03:15.830 --> 00:03:17.720
very far. But in 1945,

62
00:03:17.721 --> 00:03:21.350
he suffered a setback when he lost the election to his labor opponents,

63
00:03:21.351 --> 00:03:24.950
without a seat in the house of commons Profumo was given a smaller position as a

64
00:03:25.150 --> 00:03:25.983
delegate to Japan.

65
00:03:26.090 --> 00:03:30.030
So he spent the next few years broad preparing to rebuild his political career.

66
00:03:30.130 --> 00:03:34.790
The 1950s went much better for Profumo during the 1950 general election,

67
00:03:34.791 --> 00:03:37.110
he was put up as a candidate in Stratford,

68
00:03:37.270 --> 00:03:39.260
on Ave than a conservative constitu win.

69
00:03:39.570 --> 00:03:42.820
That was considered a safe bet for him to win, which he did.

70
00:03:42.840 --> 00:03:45.660
And then he became an MP again. Then the following year,

71
00:03:45.661 --> 00:03:48.940
the conservatives took power as Winston Churchill became the new prime minister

72
00:03:48.941 --> 00:03:49.774
of the United Kingdom.

73
00:03:49.800 --> 00:03:54.140
And Profumo began climbing the steps of the political ladder as he was regarded

74
00:03:54.141 --> 00:03:57.020
as one of the promising up and comers of the conservative party.

75
00:03:57.420 --> 00:04:00.850
He various positions mainly for the ministry of S sport and the ministry of

76
00:04:00.851 --> 00:04:02.570
foreign affairs. And in 1960,

77
00:04:02.590 --> 00:04:06.610
he was appointed the new secretary of state for war under prime minister,

78
00:04:06.611 --> 00:04:10.650
Harold McMillan, his private life wasn't too Shay either as in 1954,

79
00:04:10.680 --> 00:04:14.050
Profumo married Valerie Hobson, popular actress of a day,

80
00:04:14.051 --> 00:04:15.970
best known for a rolls in the movies, kind,

81
00:04:16.070 --> 00:04:18.690
hearts and cor S and brighter Frankenstein.

82
00:04:18.830 --> 00:04:21.960
So now let's move over to who art's second protagonist,

83
00:04:22.400 --> 00:04:24.040
Kristin Margaret Keila.

84
00:04:24.100 --> 00:04:28.160
She was born in Oxbridge west London on February the 22nd, 1942.

85
00:04:28.380 --> 00:04:32.760
And her early life was markedly different from that of Profumo.

86
00:04:32.780 --> 00:04:36.560
Her father left the family when Christine was a small girl and she then had to

87
00:04:36.561 --> 00:04:41.510
relocate to the village of rebury with a mother and a new partner who lived in

88
00:04:41.511 --> 00:04:45.110
a pair of converted railway carriages Kela may have been abused when she was

89
00:04:45.111 --> 00:04:48.830
young. It is a bit unclear due to conflicting statements when she was 17,

90
00:04:48.831 --> 00:04:49.664
she became pregnant.

91
00:04:49.730 --> 00:04:52.790
But the father who was an American serviceman returned to America,

92
00:04:52.791 --> 00:04:56.670
Christine was forced to give birth a home in secrets and her son who was

93
00:04:56.671 --> 00:05:00.190
premature died a few days later, unsurprisingly,

94
00:05:00.191 --> 00:05:02.580
Christine Kela life was not a happy one.

95
00:05:02.581 --> 00:05:05.020
And she wanted to spend as little time there as possible.

96
00:05:05.360 --> 00:05:07.420
She soon left school and worked a string of jobs,

97
00:05:07.421 --> 00:05:09.740
including as a waitress and a model. In the late fifties,

98
00:05:09.840 --> 00:05:12.940
she found work at a CD nightclub in Soho called Murray's,

99
00:05:12.941 --> 00:05:17.180
where she was employed as both a hostess and a topless showgirl at the club ki

100
00:05:17.420 --> 00:05:20.380
met and befriended two people who would play important roles in the perfume, a,

101
00:05:20.580 --> 00:05:25.250
the Mandy rice Davies and Stephen Ward rice Davies was a showgirl like

102
00:05:25.650 --> 00:05:25.651
Keila.

103
00:05:25.651 --> 00:05:29.610
While Stephen Ward was a successful osteopath who had a lot of high profile

104
00:05:29.611 --> 00:05:29.931
clients,

105
00:05:29.931 --> 00:05:33.650
such as movie stars and politicians a sure while later Kela had moved him with

106
00:05:33.930 --> 00:05:37.010
ward, although she insisted that their relationship was purely platonic,

107
00:05:37.320 --> 00:05:40.970
more like a brother and sister among Ward's important friends was,

108
00:05:41.130 --> 00:05:43.240
will master the VI count Astor.

109
00:05:43.260 --> 00:05:46.760
And the two were close enough that the Lord even allowed warden is on to rush to

110
00:05:46.920 --> 00:05:49.320
vacation at his country estate called Cliveden.

111
00:05:49.380 --> 00:05:53.160
And this is exactly what warden Kela were doing over the weekend of July,

112
00:05:53.161 --> 00:05:54.480
the eighth, 1961.

113
00:05:54.510 --> 00:05:58.040
They were relaxing by the swimming pool when Lord Astor introduced them to two

114
00:05:58.060 --> 00:06:02.360
new guests, the actresses, Valerie Hobson and her husband war secretary,

115
00:06:02.800 --> 00:06:03.633
John Fumo

116
00:06:09.450 --> 00:06:10.161
Right off the bat.

117
00:06:10.161 --> 00:06:13.520
John Profumo was smithing with the young model who was swimming naked when he

118
00:06:13.521 --> 00:06:14.480
first laid eyes on her.

119
00:06:15.200 --> 00:06:18.230
Stephen Ward on the other hand was more into interested in another one of Lord

120
00:06:18.910 --> 00:06:22.110
ASTA's guests, a Russian diplomat named ye GU Ivanov.

121
00:06:22.120 --> 00:06:25.950
Officially Ivanov was listed as a Naval latae with the Soviet embassy,

122
00:06:26.010 --> 00:06:30.270
but everyone knew is actually a spy working for the G U the Soviet military

123
00:06:30.271 --> 00:06:34.070
intelligence agency ward had been approached by MI five to help them cultivate a

124
00:06:34.071 --> 00:06:37.340
relationship with Ivan a as they hoped he would defected their side.

125
00:06:37.700 --> 00:06:41.620
Their association was a two way street as Ivanov also tried to pump board for

126
00:06:41.621 --> 00:06:43.500
information regarding his high profile clients.

127
00:06:43.610 --> 00:06:45.380
According to one government report,

128
00:06:45.660 --> 00:06:48.180
ward had at least 40 ministers and MP as patients.

129
00:06:48.360 --> 00:06:52.300
So it understands of all how both MI five and the Soviets could see him as a

130
00:06:52.460 --> 00:06:54.980
valuable resource. We don't know whether or not ward ask.

131
00:06:55.460 --> 00:07:00.290
Christine ke have any kinds of Lia on with any of the men at Lord A's party,

132
00:07:00.550 --> 00:07:03.810
but he certainly did not discourage our relationships,

133
00:07:03.920 --> 00:07:07.410
both Profumo and Ivan a met her for the first time on that weekend.

134
00:07:07.470 --> 00:07:09.970
And they both began affairs with us. Soon after now,

135
00:07:09.971 --> 00:07:13.930
we arrive at a contentious point in the story one, which has multiple versions.

136
00:07:13.990 --> 00:07:17.410
And we cannot say with certainty that any of them are completely true or false,

137
00:07:17.411 --> 00:07:21.400
whether on not the love triangle actually enabled the Russians to obtain

138
00:07:21.401 --> 00:07:25.880
sensitive information from Profumo the war secretary always denied it even after

139
00:07:25.881 --> 00:07:29.280
the whole matter was discovered saying that his conversations with Kela were

140
00:07:29.281 --> 00:07:32.680
nothing but pillow talk and an independent inquiry that was conducted confirmed

141
00:07:32.681 --> 00:07:37.000
this. However, a KGP report later obtained by the Americans claims the opposite,

142
00:07:37.030 --> 00:07:40.550
according to one Soviet by who reigns unidentified to this day,

143
00:07:40.950 --> 00:07:44.750
the Russians got a lot of useful information from Profumo courtesy of his

144
00:07:45.230 --> 00:07:48.550
dalliance with Christine Kela the report even asserted that I even of had been

145
00:07:48.551 --> 00:07:51.510
able to bug Profumo apartments. This all came later. However,

146
00:07:51.620 --> 00:07:55.390
once that whole affair had been exposed for now, it was still 1961.

147
00:07:55.391 --> 00:07:59.660
And Christine Kela was involved with a British politician and a Soviet at spy.

148
00:07:59.690 --> 00:08:02.300
Both relationships were just short flings.

149
00:08:02.370 --> 00:08:07.300
John Profumo liaison with Kela lasted anywhere from a few weeks to a few months,

150
00:08:07.400 --> 00:08:11.020
but it was definitely over by the end of the year, even.

151
00:08:11.040 --> 00:08:15.140
So I five became aware of the war secretaries association with Kela and were

152
00:08:15.141 --> 00:08:17.780
concerned enough that they alerted the cabinets. However,

153
00:08:17.920 --> 00:08:20.090
it was too early to raise in the arm bells.

154
00:08:20.091 --> 00:08:23.530
All that happened was a private meeting between John Profumo and the cabinet

155
00:08:23.970 --> 00:08:25.410
secretary, sir, Norman Brook,

156
00:08:25.411 --> 00:08:30.050
who advised Profumo to stay away from ward and his entourage and informed him of

157
00:08:30.051 --> 00:08:34.130
their relationship with Ivan Arvin, how MI five was monitoring the situation.

158
00:08:34.310 --> 00:08:37.290
The war secretary broke off with Christine ke. After that meeting,

159
00:08:37.670 --> 00:08:39.650
he wrote a letter which said, darling,

160
00:08:40.520 --> 00:08:44.000
last something's blown up tomorrow night and I can't therefore make it I'm

161
00:08:44.001 --> 00:08:44.600
terribly sorry.

162
00:08:44.600 --> 00:08:47.920
Especially as I leave the next day for various trips and might be able to see

163
00:08:47.921 --> 00:08:50.600
you again until sometime in September, blast it.

164
00:08:50.620 --> 00:08:53.560
Please take great care of yourself and don't run away.

165
00:08:54.030 --> 00:08:58.320
Love Jay Profumo would come to regret writing this letter because Keila kept it

166
00:08:58.321 --> 00:09:02.240
and later showed it to the tabloids. But for now, at least always, well,

167
00:09:02.600 --> 00:09:04.360
his little thumb was over than he could. Once again,

168
00:09:04.370 --> 00:09:05.840
focus on his political career.

169
00:09:05.990 --> 00:09:09.200
Even if people in the cabinet or MI five suspected him of an affair,

170
00:09:09.390 --> 00:09:13.080
such concerns were kept quiet. The press had not gotten winds of the liaison,

171
00:09:13.300 --> 00:09:18.270
and nobody was looking to make a big scandal out of the whole thing. Elise,

172
00:09:18.490 --> 00:09:19.323
not yet

173
00:09:25.400 --> 00:09:26.120
For the time being,

174
00:09:26.120 --> 00:09:30.340
it looks like Profumo indiscretion would quickly be overlooked and forgotten as

175
00:09:30.500 --> 00:09:30.960
for Kela.

176
00:09:30.960 --> 00:09:34.540
She moved on from a Italians with the war secretary and began a new relationship

177
00:09:34.541 --> 00:09:38.930
with a Jamaican on jazz singer named Allos lucky Gordon.

178
00:09:39.190 --> 00:09:42.530
The musician had actually first met Christine Keeler on August the seventh,

179
00:09:43.050 --> 00:09:48.010
1961. Back when she was still with Profumo in a cafe in nodding hill,

180
00:09:48.120 --> 00:09:51.610
like many other men in her life, he was immediately infatuated with, uh,

181
00:09:51.670 --> 00:09:55.690
so he was eager to comfort her when her affair with the politician was over.

182
00:09:56.120 --> 00:10:00.320
However, their relationship was tempestuous often filled with drug fueled,

183
00:10:00.321 --> 00:10:01.520
violent confrontations,

184
00:10:01.521 --> 00:10:06.480
including one time when Gordon kept Kela hostage for two days and threatened her

185
00:10:06.481 --> 00:10:10.880
with an ax. By the end of 1962, the 20 year old had an enough of the musicians,

186
00:10:11.160 --> 00:10:14.720
temper, um, was just about ready to move on. In September of that year,

187
00:10:14.860 --> 00:10:19.310
she met a music promot and small time hustler from Antiga named Johnny Edgecomb.

188
00:10:19.530 --> 00:10:24.070
And the two soon became lovers, but comb wasn't the quiet, peaceful type either.

189
00:10:24.130 --> 00:10:28.470
And he even got into a fight with lucky Gordon over Kela giving the jazz singer

190
00:10:28.590 --> 00:10:32.510
a cut on his face that required 17 stitches to close.

191
00:10:32.730 --> 00:10:34.790
The fight happens in October,

192
00:10:34.790 --> 00:10:37.820
1962 and Christine Keila left Edgecomb soon after were removed back into Steven

193
00:10:37.821 --> 00:10:41.460
Ward's apartment at 17 wi born news in Malarone comb,

194
00:10:41.461 --> 00:10:45.020
however was not willing to let her go and did inadvertently set in motion.

195
00:10:45.120 --> 00:10:48.100
The events that led to the Profumo scandal on December the 14th,

196
00:10:48.420 --> 00:10:51.660
1962 Edgecomb showed up at Ward's flat looking to speak with Kela.

197
00:10:51.661 --> 00:10:53.260
She wanted nothing to do with him.

198
00:10:53.320 --> 00:10:57.220
So she threw a one pound note for the cab there and told him to leave Edgecomb.

199
00:10:57.290 --> 00:11:00.770
However wouldn't hear of it. So he tried to shoulder barge the apartment door.

200
00:11:00.960 --> 00:11:01.930
When this didn't work,

201
00:11:01.950 --> 00:11:05.410
he pulled out a gun fired six shots into the door and the wall above it.

202
00:11:05.550 --> 00:11:08.730
He left soon afterwards, but was arrested and charged on multiple counts,

203
00:11:08.731 --> 00:11:11.810
including attempted murder taken as an isolated instant.

204
00:11:11.811 --> 00:11:13.930
This would've hardly been front page news. However,

205
00:11:14.280 --> 00:11:17.290
when she was giving her statement to the police, Keila mentioned,

206
00:11:17.291 --> 00:11:21.280
Profumo an Ivan of the cops did not do anything about it since neither men had

207
00:11:21.520 --> 00:11:25.320
anything to do with the crime, but this was how the rumors got started.

208
00:11:25.570 --> 00:11:29.440
There had always been whispers regarding Profumo having an affair,

209
00:11:29.960 --> 00:11:33.440
but nobody pressed the story. Since without the Soviet connection,

210
00:11:33.441 --> 00:11:36.160
it wouldn't have been considered a big deal. In fact, prime minister,

211
00:11:36.880 --> 00:11:39.230
Harold McMillan famously wrote in his diary at, at the outset of the scandal.

212
00:11:39.510 --> 00:11:43.550
I was forced to spend a great deal of today over a silly scrape women this time.

213
00:11:43.680 --> 00:11:45.190
Thank God not boys.

214
00:11:45.610 --> 00:11:50.590
It is true that if the whole thing had only been about an MP, having an affair,

215
00:11:50.660 --> 00:11:54.800
everybody else would've probably also treated it like a minor scrape. However,

216
00:11:55.230 --> 00:11:59.680
Christine Keer seemed ready to share her story with whoever was willing to

217
00:11:59.681 --> 00:12:03.560
listen as it happened to one of those people was a former P named John Lewis who

218
00:12:03.561 --> 00:12:06.200
had met Keila in a nightclub on baker street,

219
00:12:06.250 --> 00:12:09.840
where she told him of her affair with John Fumo Lewis had been a member of the

220
00:12:09.841 --> 00:12:10.460
labor party,

221
00:12:10.460 --> 00:12:14.670
who opposed the conservative Tories with which included Profumo not only that,

222
00:12:14.671 --> 00:12:18.350
but he also had a personal grudge against Steven Ward due to a dispute over a

223
00:12:18.351 --> 00:12:22.150
former lover Lewis relished the opportunity to cause some trouble for the,

224
00:12:22.350 --> 00:12:23.310
to and for ward.

225
00:12:23.370 --> 00:12:27.230
And so he passed on Kela story to a friends and former colleague of his names,

226
00:12:27.231 --> 00:12:29.550
George wig, who was serving as an MP at the time.

227
00:12:29.830 --> 00:12:32.790
And coincidentally had an ax to grind with John Profumo.

228
00:12:33.120 --> 00:12:38.060
The main reason why no newspaper had mentioned the affair up to that point was

229
00:12:38.061 --> 00:12:42.940
because they would most definitely get sued for libel and most likely lose the

230
00:12:42.941 --> 00:12:46.020
case. We benefited from something called parliamentary privilege,

231
00:12:46.021 --> 00:12:49.660
which provides him with legal immunity while carrying out his duty. Therefore,

232
00:12:49.661 --> 00:12:51.500
when he brought up the affair in the house of commons,

233
00:12:51.501 --> 00:12:54.610
he was safe from prosecution because he was doing so in the interest of national

234
00:12:55.010 --> 00:12:58.050
security and definitely not to get revenge on a political enemy.

235
00:13:04.310 --> 00:13:07.650
The case against Profumo unfolded in the house of commons and incremental steps.

236
00:13:07.970 --> 00:13:11.970
A first wig was basically doing it alone and she had not mentioned the war

237
00:13:12.290 --> 00:13:15.360
secretary by name. This is all happen in March, 1963,

238
00:13:15.361 --> 00:13:17.760
around the same time as Johnny Ekins trial,

239
00:13:18.020 --> 00:13:22.160
who was convicted of possessing a firearm with intent to harm and sentenced to

240
00:13:22.161 --> 00:13:25.320
seven years in prison. Christine Keer was supposed to testify in the case,

241
00:13:25.340 --> 00:13:27.280
but she fled the country to avoid doing so,

242
00:13:27.390 --> 00:13:29.720
even though she simply went to Spain on vacation,

243
00:13:30.080 --> 00:13:31.200
this was not known at the time.

244
00:13:31.400 --> 00:13:34.320
So there was talk that the Tories might have corrupted the witness to make the

245
00:13:34.321 --> 00:13:35.071
case go away.

246
00:13:35.071 --> 00:13:39.110
This new development caused more labor MPS to focus on the scandal in I

247
00:13:39.111 --> 00:13:42.390
eventually the entire party was asking the war secretary to give an official

248
00:13:42.391 --> 00:13:43.350
statement on the matter,

249
00:13:43.400 --> 00:13:46.110
after an internal discussion within the conservative party,

250
00:13:46.340 --> 00:13:49.510
John Profumo agreed to do so. And on March of the 23rd,

251
00:13:49.650 --> 00:13:52.510
he appeared before the house of commons and gave his statements where he

252
00:13:52.511 --> 00:13:56.740
basically admitted that he was friends with Kela and that he had met Ivanov

253
00:13:56.741 --> 00:14:00.100
twice. But anything more than that was just pure fabrication.

254
00:14:00.280 --> 00:14:04.420
He said there was no impropriety in my acquaintanceship with miss Kela.

255
00:14:04.520 --> 00:14:08.580
And I've made the statement because of what was said yesterday in the house by

256
00:14:08.581 --> 00:14:11.660
three honorable members whose remarks were protected by privilege.

257
00:14:11.860 --> 00:14:16.730
I have no idea where she is and any suggestion that I was in a connected with or

258
00:14:16.731 --> 00:14:21.050
responsible for our absence from the trial at the old Bailey is who and

259
00:14:21.051 --> 00:14:24.490
completely untrue. I shall not hesitate to issue Ritz for liable and slander.

260
00:14:24.790 --> 00:14:28.330
If scandalous allegations are made or repeated outside this house,

261
00:14:28.640 --> 00:14:31.210
such statements were usually taken at face value.

262
00:14:31.310 --> 00:14:35.850
So the matter was dropped for the time being Profumo was a by Kela war to both

263
00:14:36.400 --> 00:14:37.480
up his story initially,

264
00:14:37.860 --> 00:14:42.320
but this wasn't gonna last long with Profumo N untouchable Steven Ward became

265
00:14:42.340 --> 00:14:44.920
the one most affected by the burgeoning scandal.

266
00:14:45.100 --> 00:14:46.960
He was facing several vice charges,

267
00:14:46.961 --> 00:14:51.000
including forcing Keer and Mandy rice Davies into prostitution and living off

268
00:14:51.080 --> 00:14:51.913
their earnings,

269
00:14:52.080 --> 00:14:55.400
this high profile friends and all abandoned him and his once thriving apathic

270
00:14:55.840 --> 00:14:57.000
practice was now crumbling.

271
00:14:57.001 --> 00:14:59.520
Now a desperate man board wanted the truth to come out,

272
00:14:59.521 --> 00:15:01.280
hoping that it would exonerate him. First.

273
00:15:01.281 --> 00:15:03.040
He tried contacting the prime minister's office,

274
00:15:03.100 --> 00:15:06.800
but was ignored a recently discovered Mamo from the prime minister's personal

275
00:15:07.280 --> 00:15:10.200
secretary suggests that McMillan was aware of wars revel,

276
00:15:10.850 --> 00:15:14.630
but he either didn't believe him or thought his testimony was irrelevant because

277
00:15:14.730 --> 00:15:17.790
he would be arrested soon. It wasn't until ward went to the labor party,

278
00:15:17.860 --> 00:15:21.990
that McMillan was forced to make inquiries regarding his statements. Meanwhile,

279
00:15:21.991 --> 00:15:26.150
Christine Keila also changed her story mainly after Mandy rice Davies alluded to

280
00:15:26.151 --> 00:15:29.990
the press that Profumo might have been more intimate with Kela than he admitted

281
00:15:30.010 --> 00:15:32.220
to the war secretary. He was on holiday in Italy,

282
00:15:32.460 --> 00:15:34.460
went be received word about the new deployments.

283
00:15:34.520 --> 00:15:37.820
At which point he confessed everything to his wife in returned home to face the

284
00:15:37.821 --> 00:15:39.820
music on July the fifth, 1963.

285
00:15:40.060 --> 00:15:43.620
John perfu admitted that he had lied in the house of comments and resigned his

286
00:15:43.820 --> 00:15:44.653
position.

287
00:15:50.090 --> 00:15:51.970
Once Profumo lie had been exposed,

288
00:15:51.971 --> 00:15:55.530
the scandal reached a whole new level due mainly to the fact that newspapers

289
00:15:55.720 --> 00:15:58.610
were no longer under threat of being sued for liable. Now,

290
00:15:58.670 --> 00:16:01.690
the media circus started in earnest as tabloids printed,

291
00:16:01.940 --> 00:16:04.770
every salacious little detail about the affair,

292
00:16:05.000 --> 00:16:08.450
including the letter Profumo had written to Kela.

293
00:16:08.470 --> 00:16:11.250
The conservatives did what they could to minimize the damage to that party.

294
00:16:11.280 --> 00:16:13.960
They distanced themselves from promo obviously,

295
00:16:13.980 --> 00:16:16.000
and placed a lot of the blame on Kela,

296
00:16:16.100 --> 00:16:20.440
who they branded a professional seductres. They also blamed war to,

297
00:16:20.441 --> 00:16:23.240
they described as a trader working for the Soviets.

298
00:16:23.600 --> 00:16:26.680
There were calls for the prime minister to resign, but, but Millin refused.

299
00:16:26.740 --> 00:16:30.080
And in an attempt to diffuse the situation commissioned to hide justice official

300
00:16:30.400 --> 00:16:34.430
named Lord Denning to conduct an and present a report on the affair,

301
00:16:34.431 --> 00:16:38.510
mainly how it concerned the Soviets. The report was published in September,

302
00:16:38.510 --> 00:16:42.470
1963 to great public anticipation and concluded that there had been no security

303
00:16:42.471 --> 00:16:45.790
risk caused by the war secretary's actions, even.

304
00:16:45.890 --> 00:16:50.190
So the scandal had a definitive effect on the public's trust in the conservative

305
00:16:50.191 --> 00:16:54.540
party. Harold McMillan eventually resigned as prime minister during October,

306
00:16:54.540 --> 00:16:57.060
1963, citing health concerns. He did need to have an operation,

307
00:16:57.061 --> 00:17:00.740
but scholars and political figures of Pines that the medical procedure was not

308
00:17:00.741 --> 00:17:02.940
serious enough to prevent him from doing his duties.

309
00:17:03.240 --> 00:17:07.780
And that McMillan used it as a convenient excuse to say face before the perfume

310
00:17:07.900 --> 00:17:11.860
earth McMillan was known as super Mac in the British press and his party had

311
00:17:11.861 --> 00:17:14.770
easily won the previous selection and gained 20 seats in parliament,

312
00:17:14.790 --> 00:17:16.490
the 1964 general election, however,

313
00:17:16.570 --> 00:17:21.490
revealed the Tores giant drop in popularity as they lost 61 seats and the labor

314
00:17:21.491 --> 00:17:24.090
party under Harold Wilson, hummed control of the government.

315
00:17:24.190 --> 00:17:26.170
As for the people directly involved in the scandal,

316
00:17:26.280 --> 00:17:29.970
they all suffered to some degree, but none more so than Steven Ward,

317
00:17:30.070 --> 00:17:33.490
the osteopath who was branded by the government to somehow being the one

318
00:17:33.491 --> 00:17:34.960
responsible over the whole affair.

319
00:17:35.240 --> 00:17:39.960
Min acts described retroactively as political revenge and a blatant miscarriage

320
00:17:39.980 --> 00:17:42.120
of justice with his life in ruins wards,

321
00:17:42.121 --> 00:17:44.680
took an overdose of bobs and fell into a coma.

322
00:17:44.860 --> 00:17:48.240
He was found guilty and absentee of living off imoral learnings,

323
00:17:48.460 --> 00:17:50.240
but he died a few days later. Yeah,

324
00:17:50.640 --> 00:17:53.720
I an a return time to the Soviet union in December,

325
00:17:53.720 --> 00:17:55.240
1962 months before the scandal broke.

326
00:17:55.340 --> 00:17:58.400
And to the true extent of his role in the matter remains unclear to this day,

327
00:17:58.880 --> 00:18:02.400
Mandy rice Davies was coerced to testifying ward trial by Scotland yard

328
00:18:02.401 --> 00:18:06.360
inspector who arrested her on a bogus theft charge center to Holloway prison

329
00:18:06.410 --> 00:18:09.830
until she relented allegedly during her testimony,

330
00:18:09.930 --> 00:18:13.430
she had her own little moment of fame while being questioned over a sexual

331
00:18:13.431 --> 00:18:16.510
encounter. She claimed to have had with Lord ask her awards departments.

332
00:18:16.700 --> 00:18:19.990
When the opening council informed rabies that asked her Deni this,

333
00:18:19.991 --> 00:18:23.430
she gave them a memorable reply. Well, he would wouldn't he,

334
00:18:23.580 --> 00:18:27.430
Christine Keer tried making the most of her newfound fame and she became ever

335
00:18:27.431 --> 00:18:28.950
more infamous after posing naked in,

336
00:18:29.220 --> 00:18:32.820
in a photo shoot for a celebrity photographer Lewis Morley in December, 1963,

337
00:18:32.821 --> 00:18:35.540
she was found guilty of perjury and sentenced to nine months in prison,

338
00:18:35.800 --> 00:18:39.060
but served only half when she got out, she sold her story to the newspapers.

339
00:18:39.360 --> 00:18:43.540
But by then interest in the perfume affair was starting to wa Keila mainly

340
00:18:43.541 --> 00:18:45.740
stayed at the spotlight once the whole thing blew over.

341
00:18:46.100 --> 00:18:48.980
Although she did write several books on the subject in the decades that followed

342
00:18:48.981 --> 00:18:53.050
oftentimes is containing new revelations about the perfume affair that had never

343
00:18:53.051 --> 00:18:53.884
been corroborated.

344
00:18:54.150 --> 00:18:59.010
She married twice divorced twice and had two children before dying on December

345
00:18:59.010 --> 00:19:00.410
4th, 2017 at the age of 75,

346
00:19:00.440 --> 00:19:03.690
John perfume's political career went up in flames following the scandals,

347
00:19:03.830 --> 00:19:05.770
but he embarked on a road of redemption.

348
00:19:05.790 --> 00:19:08.690
He began working at a charity named toy B hall,

349
00:19:08.691 --> 00:19:12.720
which focused on hoish areas of London eventually becoming the chairman of the

350
00:19:12.721 --> 00:19:15.760
board of trustees, his wife, Valerie Hobson, stuck by his sign,

351
00:19:15.761 --> 00:19:18.440
through the whole scandal and joined him in his charitable work.

352
00:19:18.540 --> 00:19:22.440
The two of them devoted themselves to this charity until their deaths in 1975,

353
00:19:22.441 --> 00:19:26.320
perfume received a CBE from queen Elizabeth II or commander of the order of the

354
00:19:26.321 --> 00:19:28.840
British empire, recognizing his charitable efforts.

355
00:19:28.841 --> 00:19:32.510
This was a clear sign that he was longer regarded as a political prior.

356
00:19:32.690 --> 00:19:35.230
He probably could have resumed his career if he wanted to,

357
00:19:35.250 --> 00:19:37.830
but Profumo preferred to work at Twain B hall,

358
00:19:37.831 --> 00:19:41.590
which he did until his death on March the ninth, 2006.

359
00:19:41.930 --> 00:19:44.670
