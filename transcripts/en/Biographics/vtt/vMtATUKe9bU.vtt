00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:03.870
<v 0>There is so much you can say about Prince without venturing inside poverty.</v>

2
00:00:03.990 --> 00:00:07.620
He was quite literally one of the most brilliant guitar players in the history

3
00:00:07.621 --> 00:00:08.160
of music.

4
00:00:08.160 --> 00:00:12.090
He found creative ways to use his masterful production skills in the studio to

5
00:00:12.091 --> 00:00:16.200
invent new sounds and ideas. Prince could play almost every instrument.

6
00:00:16.201 --> 00:00:19.200
He touched with a supernatural confidence and stability.

7
00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:22.350
His legacy did not just extend towards his own music. Either.

8
00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:24.600
He starred in films over saw movie soundtracks,

9
00:00:25.110 --> 00:00:27.720
championed female musicians was a sex icon in his own, right.

10
00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:31.740
And even became a legendary comedy figure. Thanks to the Chappelle show.

11
00:00:31.830 --> 00:00:34.650
Prince came up in the 1980s, the decade of access,

12
00:00:34.651 --> 00:00:37.160
and while the other stars of that time like Madonna,

13
00:00:37.190 --> 00:00:41.100
Michael Jackson and Bruce Springsteen might have been louder and more prominent.

14
00:00:41.310 --> 00:00:45.210
He was content to quietly produce album after album and timeless.

15
00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:48.330
His often timeless, his Prince was known as the popper one.

16
00:00:48.331 --> 00:00:52.830
And here now is the story of one of the most mercurial and or inspiring

17
00:00:52.831 --> 00:00:53.664
talents that.

18
00:00:53.870 --> 00:00:55.310
<v 1>I have a grace to music weld.</v>

19
00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:11.210
<v 0>On June the seventh, 1958, Prince Rogers Nelson was born in Minneapolis,</v>

20
00:01:11.211 --> 00:01:14.900
Minnesota replaced that he would call home and feel a special connection to,

21
00:01:14.901 --> 00:01:17.930
for the better part of his life. His father was John Lewis, Nelson,

22
00:01:17.931 --> 00:01:22.340
a piano player and songwriter, and his mother was Mattie Della Jan singer.

23
00:01:22.400 --> 00:01:25.610
The music was in his bones from the very beginning.

24
00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:28.730
His grandparents had their roots in Louisiana. So yeah,

25
00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:30.800
that region's culture to draw from as well.

26
00:01:31.010 --> 00:01:35.330
His father took the stage as Prince Rogers and bestowed that name upon his son,

27
00:01:35.360 --> 00:01:39.710
Prince didn't cath has name and gave himself the nickname skipper utilizing it

28
00:01:39.711 --> 00:01:40.940
for the better part of his upbringing.

29
00:01:40.970 --> 00:01:44.240
Prince also had what seemed to be epilepsy and suffered from intermittent

30
00:01:44.241 --> 00:01:45.110
seizures though.

31
00:01:45.350 --> 00:01:48.740
He allegedly told his mother that they were finally cured by an angel.

32
00:01:48.770 --> 00:01:52.400
Music came fast by age seven Prince had written his first proper song called

33
00:01:52.730 --> 00:01:56.540
funky machine on his father's piano. His little sister Tyco was his frequent to,

34
00:01:57.080 --> 00:01:59.990
and they often performed around the house together that parents would divorce.

35
00:01:59.991 --> 00:02:01.760
When Prince was 10 years old, though,

36
00:02:01.761 --> 00:02:05.720
his father would buy him his first guitar crucial step and the young musicians

37
00:02:05.990 --> 00:02:09.440
ascent to greatness Prince's his mother would remarried to a man named Haywood

38
00:02:09.441 --> 00:02:11.510
Baker at a tense relationship though.

39
00:02:11.750 --> 00:02:15.230
Baker would take him to see the legendary James Brown in concert.

40
00:02:15.290 --> 00:02:19.070
Prince was also quite the sports star excelling in football, basketball,

41
00:02:19.071 --> 00:02:22.250
and baseball, and making a name for himself in the Minneapolis sports scene.

42
00:02:22.310 --> 00:02:27.020
In 1973, while in junior high Prince had a fateful encounter with Jimmy jam,

43
00:02:27.021 --> 00:02:30.260
who would go on to become a massively popular record producer.

44
00:02:30.290 --> 00:02:34.190
Jimmy was immediately taken back by the skills that Prince showed on many

45
00:02:34.191 --> 00:02:38.240
different instruments and reflected on how he and Prince would practice their

46
00:02:38.241 --> 00:02:40.310
own skills. During breaks from schoolwork,

47
00:02:40.370 --> 00:02:44.210
there was a keyboard room set up and the teacher would give you London bridge,

48
00:02:44.211 --> 00:02:47.300
or Mary had a little lamb and ask you to learn it. When she'd leave,

49
00:02:47.301 --> 00:02:50.150
would put on the headphones and rip through these keyboards.

50
00:02:50.180 --> 00:02:52.310
I was always blown away by his talent level.

51
00:02:52.490 --> 00:02:55.250
I didn't want him to get behind the drums at again. He was nuts.

52
00:02:55.310 --> 00:02:58.310
That was my awakening to his talent and genius.

53
00:02:58.400 --> 00:03:02.500
Jimmy jam immediately saw something in Prince and noted that his work ethic was

54
00:03:02.501 --> 00:03:06.460
unlike anything he'd ever seen. That power would cross again in the future.

55
00:03:06.580 --> 00:03:07.300
Two years later,

56
00:03:07.300 --> 00:03:11.290
Prince would be part of his first legitimate band called 94 East.

57
00:03:11.440 --> 00:03:14.980
The very also consisted of Pepe. Willie, who was husband to Prince, his cousin,

58
00:03:15.130 --> 00:03:16.480
Marty involved staff,

59
00:03:16.900 --> 00:03:21.100
Christy Layson Barry and Andre Simone friend of Prince Prince laid down guitar

60
00:03:21.460 --> 00:03:24.520
parts for the group. For some songs they were working on in the studio.

61
00:03:24.610 --> 00:03:28.330
It must've given him the first scratch that he needed to itch because in 1976,

62
00:03:28.331 --> 00:03:32.680
Prince made his first genuine studio demo with help of Minneapolis producer.

63
00:03:32.680 --> 00:03:36.490
Chris moon moon began to shop the demo around your record company is but found

64
00:03:36.491 --> 00:03:37.151
no takers.

65
00:03:37.151 --> 00:03:40.630
So we enlisted the help of a businessmen friends that you had in town,

66
00:03:40.690 --> 00:03:44.860
Owen Husney who likes what he heard enough to sign the then 19 year old to a

67
00:03:44.861 --> 00:03:48.670
management contract. Husney now I have to get prints to make a proper living,

68
00:03:48.790 --> 00:03:53.500
which he did at studio 80 studios in Minneapolis and put together a press kit to

69
00:03:53.650 --> 00:03:55.930
start to finally entice them record labels.

70
00:03:56.020 --> 00:03:59.320
They began to work Warner brothers and several other high profile companies

71
00:03:59.321 --> 00:04:03.070
began to swarm around the young Prince Warner brothers was the label Prince

72
00:04:03.071 --> 00:04:06.700
ultimately decided on partly because they promised him creative control over his

73
00:04:06.701 --> 00:04:10.720
music. Even if they still retains the publishing rights in 1978,

74
00:04:11.080 --> 00:04:15.400
Prince headed to California and the world famous record plant studio and made

75
00:04:15.460 --> 00:04:19.150
his debut album for you of the nine songs contained on the record.

76
00:04:19.150 --> 00:04:20.620
Prince wrote every word,

77
00:04:21.040 --> 00:04:24.400
sang every lyric and played every single of the 27 instruments.

78
00:04:24.580 --> 00:04:28.870
The album spawns a few minor hits most notably soft and wet Prince's

79
00:04:28.871 --> 00:04:29.710
1979.

80
00:04:29.711 --> 00:04:34.060
Sophomore efforts simply titled Prince was when things really started to take

81
00:04:34.061 --> 00:04:36.820
off the album, went platinum had two major hits.

82
00:04:36.880 --> 00:04:39.670
Why you want to treat me so bad and I want to be your lover.

83
00:04:39.820 --> 00:04:42.610
And it's featured the first of his professionally assembled bands.

84
00:04:42.700 --> 00:04:44.470
The next year, his or his third album,

85
00:04:44.471 --> 00:04:48.700
dirty mind created in his own home studio and an opening slot on Rick James.

86
00:04:48.850 --> 00:04:51.160
His 1980 tool, things were in momentum,

87
00:04:51.220 --> 00:04:55.360
but that was still some hiccups for the young burgeoning stop offs. 1981,

88
00:04:55.480 --> 00:04:56.710
his controversy was released.

89
00:04:56.860 --> 00:05:00.940
Prince was offered a spot on the rolling stones tour during a stop in Los

90
00:05:00.941 --> 00:05:04.960
Angeles. He was forced to leave the stage after only three stones after stones,

91
00:05:04.961 --> 00:05:06.970
fans began throwing trash at the stage.

92
00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:09.760
Still the world was prime that for princess taking,

93
00:05:09.761 --> 00:05:11.470
and it seems nothing would stop him.

94
00:05:11.770 --> 00:05:16.330
But even those lofty expectations were exceeded. The very next year.

95
00:05:22.290 --> 00:05:22.890
<v 2>[Inaudible].</v>

96
00:05:22.890 --> 00:05:26.730
<v 0>Dublin Melvins are notoriously haunted markets and fickle to get consumers to</v>

97
00:05:26.731 --> 00:05:28.650
buy. It's a lot of content. Sure.

98
00:05:28.651 --> 00:05:33.120
But it's also twice the price when Prince released 1999 in 1982,

99
00:05:33.300 --> 00:05:36.360
it wasn't just the album title that was learnt years ahead of its time.

100
00:05:36.390 --> 00:05:40.410
The music was absolutely stunning and record buyers agreed as the album sold

101
00:05:40.411 --> 00:05:44.940
over 3 million copies songs like the track delirious and little red Corvette

102
00:05:45.300 --> 00:05:50.040
certified smashes spurred on by the massive popularity of the music channel MTV

103
00:05:50.041 --> 00:05:54.240
web print sent some of the first black music videos ever at Prince was not done

104
00:05:54.241 --> 00:05:55.560
topping himself yet. However,

105
00:05:55.620 --> 00:05:58.070
after officially christening his stellar backing back,

106
00:05:58.220 --> 00:06:01.340
he sent him out to create a film and album combination that would change the

107
00:06:01.341 --> 00:06:01.820
game.

108
00:06:01.820 --> 00:06:05.780
And it did purple rain was the vehicle that sent Prince from respected musician

109
00:06:05.781 --> 00:06:10.280
to stratospheric superstar. The film version was based loosely on his life.

110
00:06:10.280 --> 00:06:13.550
And as the album sold over 30 million copies at one time,

111
00:06:13.610 --> 00:06:16.880
Prince had the number one album song and film in the country.

112
00:06:16.910 --> 00:06:18.800
Something that had never been done before,

113
00:06:18.890 --> 00:06:21.680
not everyone was impressed by this amazing run of success though.

114
00:06:21.830 --> 00:06:26.300
Tipper Gore wife of Al heard her daughter listening to one of Prince's songs

115
00:06:26.301 --> 00:06:27.710
called darling Nikki. One day,

116
00:06:27.770 --> 00:06:31.790
the song is overtly sexual and references masturbation among other things.

117
00:06:31.940 --> 00:06:35.900
This inspired her to create the notorious parents' music resource center,

118
00:06:35.930 --> 00:06:39.590
which began slapping warning labels on records in an effort to clean up the

119
00:06:39.591 --> 00:06:43.430
industry and one parents about the explicit material that children might be

120
00:06:43.431 --> 00:06:43.821
hearing.

121
00:06:43.821 --> 00:06:48.440
It still could not stop princess popularity as a pop star and sexual icon

122
00:06:48.441 --> 00:06:52.280
though. His albums and songs kept coming at an absolutely prolific rate.

123
00:06:52.460 --> 00:06:56.990
1985 saw around the world in a day with the head raspberry beret parade was

124
00:06:56.991 --> 00:06:59.120
released in 1986 containing Kissinger.

125
00:06:59.150 --> 00:07:02.990
The album actually served as a kind of soundtrack to his second starring role in

126
00:07:02.991 --> 00:07:05.480
a movie, the underwhelming under the cherry moon,

127
00:07:05.481 --> 00:07:08.420
which principles so directed a claims or not,

128
00:07:08.450 --> 00:07:13.220
that seemed to be nothing the man could not do and no a higher plateau to reach.

129
00:07:13.221 --> 00:07:16.550
So he went back to basics and disbanded. The revel

130
00:07:23.380 --> 00:07:27.460
Prince was so prolific in his songwriting and creative ideas that he simply did

131
00:07:27.461 --> 00:07:30.970
not have enough time in one solo career. As far back as 1981,

132
00:07:30.971 --> 00:07:33.040
he was doing side projects, collaborations,

133
00:07:33.041 --> 00:07:35.620
and spinoffs with a whole slew of other artists.

134
00:07:35.650 --> 00:07:39.910
He started a side project that year called the time during the decade of the

135
00:07:39.911 --> 00:07:42.280
1980s, the time put out four albums.

136
00:07:42.281 --> 00:07:45.220
And though the public knew that Prince had something to do with the group.

137
00:07:45.340 --> 00:07:47.920
His involvement wasn't fully known for quite some time.

138
00:07:48.010 --> 00:07:50.470
Morris day was the singer and leader of the group,

139
00:07:50.500 --> 00:07:53.800
but it turns out Prince was writing and recording. Most of the songs,

140
00:07:53.801 --> 00:07:57.460
the group released Prince was also involved with the more jazzy band in 1985

141
00:07:57.461 --> 00:08:01.630
called the family that one album featured songs solely written by Prince and is

142
00:08:01.631 --> 00:08:05.320
notable for hosting. The original version of nothing compares to you,

143
00:08:05.470 --> 00:08:09.040
which was made into a hit single years later by Chanetta corner.

144
00:08:09.160 --> 00:08:13.450
He provided the bangles with their smash in 1986, hits manic Monday, Sheena,

145
00:08:13.451 --> 00:08:14.560
Easton, Chaka Khan,

146
00:08:14.561 --> 00:08:18.790
and Sheila E all enjoyed some time on the chance because of songs that Prince

147
00:08:18.791 --> 00:08:21.550
couldn't find a place for in his own discography.

148
00:08:21.700 --> 00:08:23.830
When Prince wasn't writing volts full of songs,

149
00:08:23.831 --> 00:08:26.830
he was assembling entire groups from scratch in 1981,

150
00:08:26.831 --> 00:08:29.470
before he had even really gained much traction in the music world.

151
00:08:29.680 --> 00:08:32.320
He put together an all girl group called a vanity six,

152
00:08:32.350 --> 00:08:36.070
but that wasn't exactly the original name at first Prince wanted the trio of

153
00:08:36.071 --> 00:08:40.330
females to be dubbed the hookers, but that didn't come to pass Prince dress,

154
00:08:40.331 --> 00:08:44.110
the girls in high heels and lingerie and had them singing sexually charged

155
00:08:44.111 --> 00:08:46.930
lyrics. They were a hit though for a short time.

156
00:08:47.020 --> 00:08:51.040
It seemed everything that Prince touched just, um, to purple.

157
00:08:55.930 --> 00:08:57.890
<v 2>[Inaudible]. Now the Prince.</v>

158
00:08:58.400 --> 00:09:01.760
<v 0>Without the constraints of a bands, he funneled two side projects, surprise,</v>

159
00:09:01.761 --> 00:09:05.750
surprise. He had those into a massive three LP project.

160
00:09:05.751 --> 00:09:08.270
He intended to be called crystal ball Warner brothers.

161
00:09:08.271 --> 00:09:11.510
Apparently didn't realize that Prince was pretty good at getting people to buy

162
00:09:11.511 --> 00:09:14.660
whatever he put out. So they demanded he cut back his ambitions.

163
00:09:14.870 --> 00:09:18.200
It was not the first time Prince and record companies would butt heads and it

164
00:09:18.201 --> 00:09:19.670
would actually get much worse.

165
00:09:19.790 --> 00:09:24.470
But this time Prince relented side of the times was released in 1987 and likely

166
00:09:24.471 --> 00:09:28.520
earned in the most declaim of any record he had put out to date and those

167
00:09:28.521 --> 00:09:30.890
records then knit timeless at one,

168
00:09:30.891 --> 00:09:35.390
a whole slew of end of year awards and turns in may level of artistic respect

169
00:09:35.420 --> 00:09:39.290
that he hadn't quite had previously not content to rest on his laurels.

170
00:09:39.320 --> 00:09:42.890
Prince walks on more music and ball ways to reinvent himself.

171
00:09:43.100 --> 00:09:46.640
His next project would be the black album and it would feature more gritty songs

172
00:09:46.641 --> 00:09:48.560
with funk and hip hop influences.

173
00:09:48.740 --> 00:09:52.880
He also plans to pull a Beatles move and release the album where they symbol one

174
00:09:52.881 --> 00:09:57.020
color sleeve with no markings or words other than a catalog number.

175
00:09:57.080 --> 00:10:01.220
Nearly half a million of the albums were pressed and ready for shipping before

176
00:10:01.340 --> 00:10:01.851
print sand.

177
00:10:01.851 --> 00:10:05.960
What he called a spiritual moment where he learns that the album itself was evil

178
00:10:05.990 --> 00:10:09.050
and he shelved the entire project mid production.

179
00:10:09.200 --> 00:10:12.800
He quickly changed his tune and put out what he thought was a better message

180
00:10:12.801 --> 00:10:15.020
with 1988. Love sexy.

181
00:10:15.260 --> 00:10:19.430
The last two years of the 1980s saw Prince Trier's hands at yet another motion

182
00:10:19.431 --> 00:10:23.060
picture graffiti bridge, but unfortunately the film and the company,

183
00:10:23.210 --> 00:10:25.820
young soundtrack album, where a massive disappointment,

184
00:10:25.821 --> 00:10:30.380
which seems to start to reveal some chinks and Prince's armor and gave him a

185
00:10:30.381 --> 00:10:33.890
little less clout and leeway than he was afforded by his record label.

186
00:10:33.920 --> 00:10:34.880
He did make up for it.

187
00:10:35.120 --> 00:10:38.990
Some with the songs he contributed to the 1999 Batman movie that Tim Burton

188
00:10:38.991 --> 00:10:43.760
directed the album sold over 4 million copies and drew a decade of astonishing

189
00:10:43.761 --> 00:10:46.460
career accomplishments to a close Prince of course,

190
00:10:46.550 --> 00:10:49.190
was looking as a new start for the coming 1990s.

191
00:10:49.250 --> 00:10:52.880
And that new start would include Prince's very name and what he called a

192
00:10:52.881 --> 00:10:55.310
combination of the male and female gender symbols.

193
00:10:55.460 --> 00:10:58.580
He drew up what was in essence, an unpronounceable symbol.

194
00:10:58.610 --> 00:11:02.630
Some goals is the love symbol and the whole law deal led to him being dubbed as

195
00:11:02.780 --> 00:11:06.080
the artist formerly known as Prince for a time, of course,

196
00:11:06.081 --> 00:11:08.990
this caused a rift with his record label Warner brothers,

197
00:11:08.991 --> 00:11:12.650
as they didn't know how to market some things that technically no longer had a

198
00:11:12.651 --> 00:11:17.150
name. The label began to push back refusing to release the tons of music he had

199
00:11:17.160 --> 00:11:18.380
contained in his volts.

200
00:11:18.440 --> 00:11:22.280
His answer was to begin releasing massive amounts of new music with new backing

201
00:11:22.670 --> 00:11:22.680
bands,

202
00:11:22.680 --> 00:11:26.930
the new power generation at a super fast clip in order to fulfill his contract

203
00:11:26.960 --> 00:11:30.470
quicker and be released from any more artistic obligations with warn app,

204
00:11:30.500 --> 00:11:34.250
even appeared with the word slave on his face at public events to show how he

205
00:11:34.251 --> 00:11:35.450
felt he was being treated.

206
00:11:35.480 --> 00:11:38.390
And that's how the first half of the 1990s went for the artist.

207
00:11:38.391 --> 00:11:42.530
Formerly known as Prince see released six albums of quality music that likely

208
00:11:42.531 --> 00:11:46.040
wasn't marketed very well by a label that no longer had control of him.

209
00:11:46.130 --> 00:11:48.500
What he wanted was true emancipation.

210
00:11:48.680 --> 00:11:51.740
Now that he was free from the Warner brothers contract that had slowly been

211
00:11:51.741 --> 00:11:54.940
stifling and emancipation was exactly what he was feeling.

212
00:11:55.090 --> 00:11:59.560
And that's exactly what he named his 1996, three disc album in 1998.

213
00:11:59.561 --> 00:12:03.580
He began emancipating some old material of his that Warner wanted no part of

214
00:12:03.700 --> 00:12:06.610
with the five disc crystal ball in 1999.

215
00:12:06.611 --> 00:12:10.240
He finally decided he wanted to reunite with a major label and to have access to

216
00:12:10.241 --> 00:12:13.810
the tools at their disposal. He cuts a deal with Arista records,

217
00:12:13.840 --> 00:12:15.970
putting out Ravens through the joy. Fantastic,

218
00:12:15.971 --> 00:12:20.170
and then ending the millennium with an all star televised concert on new year's

219
00:12:20.171 --> 00:12:24.040
Eve. While the decade of the 1990s was fraught with turmoil for the artist,

220
00:12:24.041 --> 00:12:25.000
formerly known as Prince,

221
00:12:25.240 --> 00:12:29.350
he had finally gained his artistic freedom and it was nowhere near done trying

222
00:12:29.351 --> 00:12:30.580
on new musical ideas.

223
00:12:30.780 --> 00:12:31.613
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

224
00:12:37.470 --> 00:12:41.040
<v 0>In two thousands Prince decided he was comfortable enough to be called by his</v>

225
00:12:41.041 --> 00:12:44.780
given name once more. He was still enamored with the love symbol, however,

226
00:12:44.781 --> 00:12:46.590
and it's continued to use it in many forms,

227
00:12:46.591 --> 00:12:50.970
including a gorgeous purple guitar Prince was utilizing new technology to bring

228
00:12:50.971 --> 00:12:52.170
his music to the masses.

229
00:12:52.290 --> 00:12:55.890
He was one of the first artists to use the internet to establish a subscription

230
00:12:55.891 --> 00:12:57.360
service to release albums.

231
00:12:57.510 --> 00:13:02.070
It was basically iTunes many years before iTunes Prince was showing more and

232
00:13:02.071 --> 00:13:03.780
more how devoted he was to his fans.

233
00:13:03.870 --> 00:13:07.830
Besides the internet releases that cut out a record label middlemen and gave

234
00:13:07.831 --> 00:13:10.860
music directly to the people. He also began opening up his home,

235
00:13:10.890 --> 00:13:15.510
the famous Paisley park studios in Minneapolis to concerts and tours in the mid

236
00:13:15.511 --> 00:13:19.260
two thousands Prince played a series of performances that would drop drawers and

237
00:13:19.350 --> 00:13:20.940
to define him for years to come,

238
00:13:21.000 --> 00:13:24.690
one was during his own induction to the rock and roll hall of fame of special

239
00:13:24.691 --> 00:13:28.950
notes is the Jamey joins near the end for fellow inductee beetle,

240
00:13:28.980 --> 00:13:32.730
George Harrison, while on stage with Harrison son, Donnie and Tom petty,

241
00:13:32.910 --> 00:13:33.840
Prince Uncorked,

242
00:13:33.841 --> 00:13:38.550
a two minute guitar solo that left the entire stage and viewing audience flawed

243
00:13:38.700 --> 00:13:42.180
in 2007 Prince was announced as the halftime performer at the super bowl.

244
00:13:42.210 --> 00:13:45.690
When the second quarter ended a stage was unveiled that took the form of his

245
00:13:45.691 --> 00:13:46.830
very own love symbol.

246
00:13:47.000 --> 00:13:50.220
Then the next 18 minutes Prince had the majority of the world in his hand,

247
00:13:50.490 --> 00:13:52.530
it was almost a storybook performance,

248
00:13:52.590 --> 00:13:56.640
140 million people watched as the rain came down. And of course,

249
00:13:56.670 --> 00:14:00.480
Prince took full advantage of the moment. Closing hours with purple rain.

250
00:14:00.570 --> 00:14:03.510
Prince was still prolific with his artistic output in the two thousands,

251
00:14:03.511 --> 00:14:07.410
including some eclectic forays into jazz on 2000 and ones, the rainbow children,

252
00:14:07.620 --> 00:14:11.310
and to return to basic sounds on 2006 31 21.

253
00:14:11.550 --> 00:14:15.300
And while he didn't have as many thunderous hits like he did in the 1980s,

254
00:14:15.510 --> 00:14:19.380
it was always a maturing and growing and creatively munch of that decade.

255
00:14:19.440 --> 00:14:24.420
And as the 2010s were almost a victory lap for Prince with defining performances

256
00:14:24.510 --> 00:14:27.510
at venues like the Grammys Coachella and the Montreux jazz.

257
00:14:35.040 --> 00:14:35.640
<v 1>[Inaudible].</v>

258
00:14:35.640 --> 00:14:37.050
<v 0>All go group in 1981.</v>

259
00:14:37.051 --> 00:14:41.390
So two D Prince approached the idea of having female musicians backing in,

260
00:14:41.391 --> 00:14:44.400
in 2013. He dubs them third eye girl,

261
00:14:44.401 --> 00:14:48.120
and he embarked on a few critically acclaimed tours with them for the next few

262
00:14:48.121 --> 00:14:52.640
years and released a few studio albums in 2000 and Prince swings on the piano

263
00:14:52.641 --> 00:14:55.400
and the microphone tour, which is exactly what it sounds like.

264
00:14:55.401 --> 00:14:59.480
And he showed how well his material was constructed at the most basic level.

265
00:14:59.570 --> 00:15:00.403
Unfortunately,

266
00:15:00.410 --> 00:15:04.720
this is also when princess health began to decline on April the seventh Prince

267
00:15:04.850 --> 00:15:08.300
up to cancel two performances of his piano tour in Atlanta citing the flu.

268
00:15:08.330 --> 00:15:12.020
He was able to rally for his April 13th show, but on the subsequent flight home,

269
00:15:12.021 --> 00:15:15.680
the next morning, his jet out to make an emergency landing in Illinois,

270
00:15:15.710 --> 00:15:17.000
where he became unresponsive.

271
00:15:17.120 --> 00:15:20.570
He was rushed to the emergency room and given a drug usually meant to revive

272
00:15:20.600 --> 00:15:22.820
opioid overdose victims. It worked.

273
00:15:22.821 --> 00:15:25.670
And then he left the ER against the advice of his doctors.

274
00:15:25.790 --> 00:15:29.270
He made a series of sporadic public appearances over the next few days before

275
00:15:29.271 --> 00:15:33.500
seeing a specialist and addiction medication on April the 20th in California,

276
00:15:33.530 --> 00:15:37.160
that specialist sung was on his way to Prince's home the next morning with

277
00:15:37.310 --> 00:15:39.200
medication to fight opioid addiction,

278
00:15:39.650 --> 00:15:42.830
but was surprised to see emergency crews trying to revive Prince.

279
00:15:42.980 --> 00:15:46.760
He was declared dead at 10:07 AM from an overdose of fentanyl.

280
00:15:47.000 --> 00:15:50.390
Prince was twice divorced and never known to have fathered. Any children.

281
00:15:50.630 --> 00:15:54.950
Music was literally his baby and the amount of left behind in his Paisley park

282
00:15:54.951 --> 00:15:56.630
home volts is simply staggering.

283
00:15:56.930 --> 00:16:00.200
There will likely be several more lifetimes of Prince music to come.

284
00:16:00.440 --> 00:16:04.490
And it's clear that his reign is nowhere near over as the cup of water.

285
00:16:04.820 --> 00:16:06.500
