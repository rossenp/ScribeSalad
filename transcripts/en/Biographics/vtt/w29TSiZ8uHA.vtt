5
00:00:18.690 --> 00:00:18.950
Unlikely,

6
00:00:18.950 --> 00:00:22.730
likely the single most successful assassin in history were 19 year olds.

7
00:00:23.090 --> 00:00:27.440
Gabriela Princip fired two shots in Sarajevo on June the 28th, 1914,

8
00:00:27.441 --> 00:00:29.420
killing the air to the Austrian throne.

9
00:00:29.660 --> 00:00:33.080
He set in motion events that would change the course of history. Uh,

10
00:00:33.081 --> 00:00:37.550
South Slavic nationalist Princip sanctions would not only result in the creation

11
00:00:37.551 --> 00:00:39.800
of a South Slav state Yugoslavia,

12
00:00:40.100 --> 00:00:43.610
but in the fall of empires and the outbreak of world war one,

13
00:00:43.700 --> 00:00:48.530
forget other assassins like John Wilkes booth or Lee Harvey Oswald compared to

14
00:00:48.531 --> 00:00:51.770
Gavrilo Princip. Those guys were amateurs. Yes.

15
00:00:51.860 --> 00:00:56.360
How much do most of us actually know about the teenager who started world war

16
00:00:56.361 --> 00:01:00.500
one, born to a poor peasant family and the desolate mountains of Western Bosnia.

17
00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:04.400
Princip seemed destined to leave no Mark on history, sickly,

18
00:01:04.460 --> 00:01:09.050
small physically weak. His life was a world away from that of the imposing,

19
00:01:09.051 --> 00:01:11.720
wealthy, powerful man that he killed. Yes,

20
00:01:11.750 --> 00:01:15.590
it would be the unlikely meeting of these two figures that decided Europe's

21
00:01:15.591 --> 00:01:18.590
destiny and known in life obscure in death.

22
00:01:18.740 --> 00:01:23.540
This is the tale of a Gavrilo Princip and the assassin who changed the world.

23
00:01:29.630 --> 00:01:31.460
It was the summer of 1894.

24
00:01:31.461 --> 00:01:34.760
When Gavrilo Princip was born into a world of utter desolation,

25
00:01:34.820 --> 00:01:36.410
his parents' home village, verbal,

26
00:01:36.411 --> 00:01:40.790
I was little more than a Hamlet clinging to the side of an unforgiving mountain.

27
00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:44.510
This was remote as to Bosnia, the place of Stony ground,

28
00:01:44.570 --> 00:01:47.200
wild rivers and bitter, nighttime frosts,

29
00:01:47.210 --> 00:01:51.920
a place so far from human civilization that locals knew it as Voco your Bina,

30
00:01:51.950 --> 00:01:56.660
which translates as the place where wolves go to it was also a

31
00:01:56.661 --> 00:01:58.400
place of biting poverty.

32
00:01:58.520 --> 00:02:02.870
The Principia lived in a small house with a dirt floor upon which Maria Princip

33
00:02:02.900 --> 00:02:07.640
gave birth to nine children, but only three survived. The boy's father.

34
00:02:07.700 --> 00:02:12.650
Peter was a part-time Melman and full-time peasant working backbreaking hours

35
00:02:12.651 --> 00:02:15.920
under a feudal system that forced him to give his crops away to remote

36
00:02:15.921 --> 00:02:16.610
landlords.

37
00:02:16.610 --> 00:02:21.410
So scans were signs of civilization in this empty lands that we don't even

38
00:02:21.411 --> 00:02:23.510
know, give reala principally date of birth.

39
00:02:23.690 --> 00:02:27.110
The municipal authorities recorded it as June the 13th, 1894.

40
00:02:27.111 --> 00:02:30.590
While the local authorities entered it as the month of July,

41
00:02:30.800 --> 00:02:34.280
it's actually something of a miracle that they bother to register it at all.

42
00:02:34.430 --> 00:02:37.940
Princip was born so week that his father supposedly wrote him off.

43
00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:41.600
It was only when a local Orthodox priest suggested that they named the child

44
00:02:41.601 --> 00:02:45.740
after the Archangel Gabriel, that the boy's survival became the shirt,

45
00:02:45.800 --> 00:02:46.970
whether that's true or not.

46
00:02:46.971 --> 00:02:51.410
It does lead us nicely to a core part of princess backgrounds like their entire

47
00:02:51.411 --> 00:02:55.490
village. The Prince ups were from the Orthodox faith in Bosnia's kaleidoscope of

48
00:02:55.491 --> 00:03:00.340
ethnicities. That meant they were Bosnian Serbs as opposed Catholic Bosnian,

49
00:03:00.341 --> 00:03:02.740
Croats or Muslim Bosniaks.

50
00:03:02.830 --> 00:03:07.150
And just to confuse you a little bit more principally being Bosnian was a whole

51
00:03:07.151 --> 00:03:11.170
different deal than him being purely Serbian by 1894,

52
00:03:11.171 --> 00:03:15.520
the Serbs already had their own independent kingdom, the Bosnian Serbs,

53
00:03:15.521 --> 00:03:18.550
or any of the Bosnians for that matter, they didn't,

54
00:03:18.790 --> 00:03:23.020
it would be this fact more than any other that would turn young princess from a

55
00:03:23.021 --> 00:03:25.360
peasant son into a violent radical.

56
00:03:32.040 --> 00:03:32.130
<v 2>[Inaudible].</v>

57
00:03:32.130 --> 00:03:35.490
<v 0>So now we've established good, very low principally backgrounds.</v>

58
00:03:35.491 --> 00:03:40.110
We need to wind back the clock a little bit just enough to understand the

59
00:03:40.111 --> 00:03:42.750
political tensions in play in Bosnia.

60
00:03:42.810 --> 00:03:47.460
The twisted path that led to an independent Serbia runs a very not independent

61
00:03:47.461 --> 00:03:52.110
Bosnia began back in the 14th century on June the 28th, 1389,

62
00:03:52.111 --> 00:03:54.090
the expansionist superpower of its day,

63
00:03:54.091 --> 00:03:58.110
the autumn and AMBA defeated the medieval Serbs at the battle of Kosovo,

64
00:03:58.170 --> 00:04:01.320
opening up the Balcones for conquest and conquer.

65
00:04:01.330 --> 00:04:05.190
They did the Ottomans would eventually Congo all the way to Vienna before

66
00:04:05.191 --> 00:04:08.190
running out of steam, sadly for Constantinople,

67
00:04:08.220 --> 00:04:12.840
all that mega conquering sends them running smack into the other superpower of

68
00:04:12.841 --> 00:04:13.674
the day.

69
00:04:13.740 --> 00:04:17.910
The Habsburgs Ruelas of Austria and long-time embers of the Holy Roman empire.

70
00:04:18.060 --> 00:04:20.730
The Habsburgs were the Ottomans worst nightmare,

71
00:04:20.790 --> 00:04:25.770
hardcore Catholics who loved a good old fashioned war over the next

72
00:04:25.771 --> 00:04:29.040
few centuries Southeast Europe became an eternal battle ground.

73
00:04:29.040 --> 00:04:33.720
Does the Habsburgs slowly push the Ottomans back for Serbs still smarting over

74
00:04:33.900 --> 00:04:38.430
their 1389 defeat of Kosovo. This was all like, well, yay,

75
00:04:38.460 --> 00:04:39.420
go Austria.

76
00:04:39.480 --> 00:04:43.140
But while the Habsburgs spent centuries supporting Antietam and Serbs,

77
00:04:43.380 --> 00:04:46.140
it wasn't because they were good neighbors in the 19th century.

78
00:04:46.141 --> 00:04:50.340
The ultimate embar became known as the sick man of Europe estate. So weak,

79
00:04:50.370 --> 00:04:53.490
the subs were able to gain defacto independence though.

80
00:04:54.210 --> 00:04:56.370
Bosniak continued to smart under Turkish rule.

81
00:04:56.490 --> 00:05:00.120
This change of fortunes had its peak in 1877,

82
00:05:00.210 --> 00:05:04.500
that hip Serbia and Imperial Russia joined forces to give the Ottomans a

83
00:05:04.740 --> 00:05:07.170
gigantic kick up the backside.

84
00:05:07.230 --> 00:05:09.810
This effectively ended their grip on the Balkans.

85
00:05:10.080 --> 00:05:13.080
It was party time in Belgrade with the tax out.

86
00:05:13.081 --> 00:05:17.460
Serbia could get started with this plan to build a pan South Slavic state one,

87
00:05:17.461 --> 00:05:19.320
including Bosnia. It was at this point.

88
00:05:19.380 --> 00:05:23.100
So the Habsburgs made their change from allies to well,

89
00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:26.610
total at the Congress of Berlin.

90
00:05:26.640 --> 00:05:29.190
They took Bosnia over themselves for the Serbs.

91
00:05:29.191 --> 00:05:30.870
This was a little like opening the front door,

92
00:05:30.871 --> 00:05:35.460
expecting a good friend only for that friend to immediately seduce your mother

93
00:05:35.580 --> 00:05:37.020
Belgrade was outraged.

94
00:05:37.050 --> 00:05:41.010
They hadn't just fought a devastating war to see the Austro-Hungarians snatch

95
00:05:41.020 --> 00:05:46.020
Bosnia, but what could tiny Cynthia and Randy do to stomp them in August, 1878,

96
00:05:46.470 --> 00:05:47.730
Austrian troops marched into Bosnia.

97
00:05:47.790 --> 00:05:52.080
Although the region remained a measure parts of the Ottoman empire. In reality,

98
00:05:52.140 --> 00:05:56.580
it became an Austrian colony. On one hand. This meant staff like improved roads,

99
00:05:56.581 --> 00:06:00.140
the first railways and trams and electric lighting for Sarajevo.

100
00:06:00.200 --> 00:06:00.890
On the other hand,

101
00:06:00.890 --> 00:06:03.800
I meant middy swapping one distant overlord for eight another.

102
00:06:03.890 --> 00:06:08.360
The smoldering resentment that this entails would turn Bosnia into a powder keg.

103
00:06:08.450 --> 00:06:09.560
When it finally exploded,

104
00:06:09.561 --> 00:06:12.440
it would bring the Austro-Hungarian embar crashing down.

105
00:06:18.610 --> 00:06:19.000
<v 1>[Inaudible].</v>

106
00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:22.000
<v 0>In the desolate mountains of Wolf Sachs land, younger reload,</v>

107
00:06:22.270 --> 00:06:24.970
Prince zip was having an utterly average childhood.

108
00:06:25.090 --> 00:06:27.970
He helped his parents work the barren lands in his spare time.

109
00:06:27.971 --> 00:06:30.310
He fished for trout in the gold mountain streams,

110
00:06:30.920 --> 00:06:33.130
but there was one respect in which Prince sips,

111
00:06:33.220 --> 00:06:35.710
early years were very far from average.

112
00:06:35.800 --> 00:06:40.510
The boy utterly excelled at school in a time and place where illiteracy levels

113
00:06:40.511 --> 00:06:45.160
stood at a staggering 88% principally taught himself, not just to read,

114
00:06:45.310 --> 00:06:48.760
but to read a books that would make war and peace look like Clifford,

115
00:06:48.940 --> 00:06:53.290
the big red dog in doing so. He discovered a whole other world in the cities.

116
00:06:53.291 --> 00:06:57.130
The early 20th century was a time of great and frantic change.

117
00:06:57.160 --> 00:07:01.000
There was automation, electricity, the earliest twinklings of mass production.

118
00:07:01.060 --> 00:07:02.200
A world of speed,

119
00:07:02.320 --> 00:07:06.970
energy transformation as Princip read about this boys from the nearby villages

120
00:07:06.971 --> 00:07:10.570
were already heading to Sarajevo his older brother, yoga among them.

121
00:07:10.720 --> 00:07:14.650
It was inevitable that the younger boy would follow him in 1907 age,

122
00:07:14.680 --> 00:07:19.450
13 Principia, and his father set out to walk the 200 odd kilometers to Sarajevo.

123
00:07:19.660 --> 00:07:23.440
Peter hadn't wanted the boy to go insisting that the family couldn't afford it.

124
00:07:23.500 --> 00:07:24.310
But then Joe,

125
00:07:24.310 --> 00:07:27.730
by now a successful small time timber merchant had offered to pay Princip

126
00:07:27.731 --> 00:07:31.420
schooling fees, and the deal had been sealed. A few weeks later,

127
00:07:31.450 --> 00:07:36.400
Princip was amidst the bustle and energy of Sarajevo ready to start a new life.

128
00:07:36.520 --> 00:07:41.410
It was sheer coincidence that he arrived just as the mother of all crises

129
00:07:41.411 --> 00:07:44.740
erupted. While principal had been learning to read relations between Austria,

130
00:07:44.741 --> 00:07:47.410
Hungary and Serbia had been worsening in 1903,

131
00:07:47.411 --> 00:07:51.160
a group of hotline nationalists had murdered Serbia's King and brought Peter

132
00:07:52.330 --> 00:07:53.950
[inaudible] to power. [inaudible] had severed.

133
00:07:54.310 --> 00:07:57.910
Servi has remaining ties with Austria and started cozying up to the end of his

134
00:07:57.911 --> 00:08:01.510
rival rush out. But while this had strange things between the two States,

135
00:08:01.570 --> 00:08:06.340
the big break came in 1908 that October the Habsburgs straight up annexed

136
00:08:06.341 --> 00:08:10.030
Bosnia, although Austria had defacto ruled Bosnia for 30 years,

137
00:08:10.210 --> 00:08:14.800
making it desert nanny sent to Europe to war Serbia was furious in

138
00:08:15.460 --> 00:08:19.000
Belgrade. The move was seen as the first step towards an Austrian takeover.

139
00:08:19.300 --> 00:08:19.840
In the end,

140
00:08:19.840 --> 00:08:23.710
the crisis was resolved when Germany gave Austria its unconditional backing.

141
00:08:23.770 --> 00:08:25.900
The only powers capable of taking on Berlin,

142
00:08:26.020 --> 00:08:30.280
France and Britain didn't care enough about Bosnia to start a war while the one

143
00:08:30.281 --> 00:08:33.940
power that did cap Russia was far too weak to tango with Germany.

144
00:08:34.120 --> 00:08:37.720
So the crisis passed at least on the world stage,

145
00:08:37.721 --> 00:08:39.820
but on the ground in Serbia and Bosnia,

146
00:08:40.210 --> 00:08:43.090
it became a catalyst in the wake of the annexation.

147
00:08:43.091 --> 00:08:46.630
The first shoots of Bosnian nationalism began to emerge people.

148
00:08:46.631 --> 00:08:50.020
Who'd never considered the question before became champions of an independent

149
00:08:50.021 --> 00:08:54.790
Bosnia as this wave of revolutionary anger swept through the coffee houses and

150
00:08:55.290 --> 00:08:56.820
through the bazaars and schools,

151
00:08:57.450 --> 00:09:00.720
Cabrillo Princip found himself getting swept hops to the boy,

152
00:09:00.750 --> 00:09:02.610
began to devour anarchist literature,

153
00:09:02.611 --> 00:09:06.810
a radical move at a time when anarchists were assassinating Kings presidents and

154
00:09:06.811 --> 00:09:10.830
empresses he fell in love with two like-minded Bosnian Serbs near Dayco

155
00:09:11.550 --> 00:09:15.660
[inaudible] and [inaudible] together. The three joints protests daubed,

156
00:09:15.960 --> 00:09:18.750
Andy Hapsburg graffiti on walls. Finally in 1910,

157
00:09:18.780 --> 00:09:22.650
the new nationalist movement got its first martyr on June the 15th Bosnians

158
00:09:23.010 --> 00:09:27.660
bogged down Zaria fired five shots at Bosnia's military governor on a bridge

159
00:09:27.750 --> 00:09:28.740
near Prince sips, home,

160
00:09:28.860 --> 00:09:33.240
all five shots missed and Zarit she used the sixth bullet to commit suicide.

161
00:09:33.300 --> 00:09:35.730
When Prince Princip rushed outside to see the commotion,

162
00:09:35.780 --> 00:09:40.530
he saw the stones still stained with [inaudible] blood. It was a gory sight,

163
00:09:40.770 --> 00:09:43.230
but it was something else to the teenage Princip too.

164
00:09:43.920 --> 00:09:45.390
It was a major inspiration.

165
00:09:45.810 --> 00:09:48.720
Now just before we get into what he does with that inspiration. I mean,

166
00:09:48.930 --> 00:09:51.000
you already know, but we're going to tell the story.

167
00:09:51.150 --> 00:09:53.850
Let me tell you about today's fantastic sponsor war thunder.

168
00:09:54.170 --> 00:09:57.030
Thunder is a realistic free to play military vehicle combat game.

169
00:09:57.180 --> 00:10:01.110
It's available on PC PS4 and Xbox one, but you only need one of those,

170
00:10:01.350 --> 00:10:05.610
no need to purchase as well. Just download and you get to playing in this game.

171
00:10:05.611 --> 00:10:07.890
There are over 1,500 to Starkey,

172
00:10:07.891 --> 00:10:12.750
accurate vehicles all the way from 1920 to the 1990s Catholic Gold's

173
00:10:12.810 --> 00:10:15.900
incredibly detailed and you can see the rule of the physics has really been

174
00:10:15.901 --> 00:10:20.010
sweated over. It's really very good. Plus the sound is good too. And look,

175
00:10:20.040 --> 00:10:23.730
you can just jump in for a quick arcade game useful if you don't have much time

176
00:10:23.910 --> 00:10:28.200
or you can play realistic and go for the more challenging stuff or if you're a

177
00:10:28.201 --> 00:10:31.110
bit hardcore, there's always simulator numbers. You know,

178
00:10:31.260 --> 00:10:34.950
I've got no idea how that is because I don't like getting my whipped over and

179
00:10:34.951 --> 00:10:37.650
over again. So John was on the battlefield today.

180
00:10:37.651 --> 00:10:39.180
There is a link below doing that,

181
00:10:39.190 --> 00:10:43.290
supports the show and it also gets you a free premium tank ship or an aircraft

182
00:10:43.380 --> 00:10:45.720
in three days of premium time as a bonus for registering.

183
00:10:45.721 --> 00:10:46.850
And let's get back to the video.

184
00:10:54.170 --> 00:10:54.171
1811,

185
00:10:54.171 --> 00:10:57.950
the general feeling of revolution had started to coalesce into specific groups

186
00:10:58.010 --> 00:10:59.450
in Serbia, proper the black hands,

187
00:10:59.451 --> 00:11:03.410
cropped up as a pet project of one of the 1983 regicides and current heads of

188
00:11:03.411 --> 00:11:06.740
Serbian intelligence and man known as APIs over in Bosnia.

189
00:11:06.770 --> 00:11:11.240
The key group was Mada Bosnia or young Bosnia possibly created with help from

190
00:11:11.241 --> 00:11:12.074
the black hands.

191
00:11:12.320 --> 00:11:16.910
Lot of balls in his goal was to free Bosnia from the Habsburgs and join it in

192
00:11:16.911 --> 00:11:18.170
union with Serbia.

193
00:11:18.350 --> 00:11:21.890
Naturally there's appealed hugely to Bosnian Serbs like Prince it by now,

194
00:11:21.891 --> 00:11:25.040
Prince SIPPET almost given up on school. His entire mind,

195
00:11:25.041 --> 00:11:29.360
all his energies were devoted to mourning the plight of Serbia and building his

196
00:11:29.361 --> 00:11:33.800
hatred towards Austria in today's terms would say that it'd become radicalized

197
00:11:34.280 --> 00:11:34.340
Prince.

198
00:11:34.340 --> 00:11:38.060
It finally broke from regular life in 1912 that year he was kicked out of school

199
00:11:38.061 --> 00:11:42.200
for attending an anti [inaudible] rally and some versions after threatening pro

200
00:11:42.201 --> 00:11:46.640
Imperial classmates with NACO dusters angry and directionless Princip wanted to

201
00:11:46.641 --> 00:11:47.211
leave, sorry,

202
00:11:47.211 --> 00:11:51.770
over behind to go to Serbia and help fight the good fight he was about to get

203
00:11:51.771 --> 00:11:53.650
his chomps an October 12,

204
00:11:53.651 --> 00:11:57.190
the first Balkan war erupted hitting the kingdoms of Serbia, Bulgaria,

205
00:11:57.191 --> 00:12:00.040
Greece in Montenegro against the decaying ultimate state.

206
00:12:00.310 --> 00:12:04.030
It was the best Johns yet kicks the Turks out of the Balkins for good,

207
00:12:04.270 --> 00:12:06.400
like a radicalized Dean going to Syria.

208
00:12:06.970 --> 00:12:11.410
Princip dropped everything and walked the 280 kilometers to Serbia to volunteer.

209
00:12:11.440 --> 00:12:14.860
Supposedly the first thing he did upon crossing the border was to fall to his

210
00:12:14.861 --> 00:12:18.160
knees and kissed the Serbian soil. If that tail is true,

211
00:12:18.161 --> 00:12:21.010
that it must've made what came next, seem older, worse. Oh,

212
00:12:21.250 --> 00:12:25.480
in the winter of 1912 was a wash with offices trying to recruit more trips,

213
00:12:25.630 --> 00:12:27.310
but wasn't principal easily tried to join up.

214
00:12:27.490 --> 00:12:29.680
His tiny frame and sickly complexion got, gotten,

215
00:12:29.860 --> 00:12:31.900
literally laughed out of recruitment centers.

216
00:12:31.990 --> 00:12:36.400
And so it was that Cabrillo Princip missed his great chance to be a part of the

217
00:12:36.401 --> 00:12:37.360
story of Serbia.

218
00:12:37.450 --> 00:12:42.370
What happened next is hazy because not much documentation exists and historians

219
00:12:42.520 --> 00:12:44.170
have wildly different theories,

220
00:12:44.200 --> 00:12:47.950
but it's generally agreed that Princip stayed on in Belgrade's joined once again

221
00:12:47.951 --> 00:12:52.300
by his radicalized friends Cabrina Vich and grab us in some versions.

222
00:12:52.300 --> 00:12:55.150
Princip was forced to sleep rough in doorways and others.

223
00:12:55.180 --> 00:12:56.860
He was the one supporting the others,

224
00:12:57.100 --> 00:13:01.240
our small stipends from his parents yet they still had enough money to submerge

225
00:13:01.241 --> 00:13:05.470
themselves in the radical coffee house scene scene where Bosnian Serbs meant to

226
00:13:05.471 --> 00:13:06.760
plot revolution there.

227
00:13:06.761 --> 00:13:10.390
The three boys soon came to the attention of Belgrade's ultra nationalist

228
00:13:10.391 --> 00:13:14.800
groups. How exactly this happens is up for debate of the two recent best English

229
00:13:14.801 --> 00:13:18.370
language books on the subject, Tim bushes, the trigger and Christopher clocks,

230
00:13:18.371 --> 00:13:21.910
the sleepwalkers butcher's book claims Princip self radicalized.

231
00:13:21.911 --> 00:13:24.670
While clock's book says that he was groomed by the black hands,

232
00:13:24.910 --> 00:13:27.550
either way there's 1913 wins on principle.

233
00:13:27.580 --> 00:13:31.060
Thoughts turns more and more towards violence action in no time at all,

234
00:13:31.210 --> 00:13:35.530
those thoughts would stop being mere thoughts and it's become a terrifying

235
00:13:35.531 --> 00:13:36.364
reality.

236
00:13:42.600 --> 00:13:42.990
<v 1>[Inaudible].</v>

237
00:13:42.990 --> 00:13:45.240
<v 0>First of all, Korean war was going so well for Serbia.</v>

238
00:13:45.241 --> 00:13:47.220
That Austria started to panic in Bosnia.

239
00:13:47.221 --> 00:13:51.180
The military governor declared a state of emergency closed Serb institutions,

240
00:13:51.270 --> 00:13:54.480
suspended the courts and shut the Bosnian parliaments up in Austria,

241
00:13:54.510 --> 00:13:58.950
proper the army chief of staff on Hudson Dorf started stomping around and

242
00:13:58.951 --> 00:14:01.470
demanding and invasion of Servier. Ironically,

243
00:14:01.471 --> 00:14:06.030
the man who stopped this was principally future victim Archduke Franz Ferdinand

244
00:14:06.060 --> 00:14:08.970
Ferdinand was the biggest dove. The VNS court,

245
00:14:09.000 --> 00:14:13.890
the lone voice agitating against starting a major war in the Balkans come

246
00:14:14.100 --> 00:14:14.940
some in 1913,

247
00:14:14.941 --> 00:14:19.140
the Ottomans had been all but driven out of the Balkans and Serbian territory in

248
00:14:19.141 --> 00:14:21.510
majorly expanded for principle in his mates.

249
00:14:21.540 --> 00:14:23.640
This was all the evidence they needed,

250
00:14:23.641 --> 00:14:27.270
that the impossible would soon happen that the peninsula would seem to be free

251
00:14:27.271 --> 00:14:31.260
of Imperial powers that winds up Princip stayed with his parents in Chile

252
00:14:32.010 --> 00:14:34.110
[inaudible] but when he returns to Belgrade in March,

253
00:14:34.140 --> 00:14:38.070
it was didn't use that hit him like a haymaker to the groin all over the Serbian

254
00:14:38.520 --> 00:14:41.880
capital headlines bled from newspapers, Franz Virgin, and was going to visit,

255
00:14:41.881 --> 00:14:46.440
sorry, over that summer, his chosen date, June the 28th, as you may recall,

256
00:14:46.441 --> 00:14:51.210
June 28th was the battle of Kosovo, a date. So emotionally charged for Serbs,

257
00:14:51.410 --> 00:14:54.890
almost like combining July the fourth with nine 11.

258
00:14:55.070 --> 00:14:57.140
Now imagine that you heard that nine 11, seven,

259
00:14:57.141 --> 00:15:00.860
four was going to be marked by a genetic crossbreed of a solid bin,

260
00:15:01.310 --> 00:15:04.550
Lauden and King George, the third stomping around his New York,

261
00:15:04.551 --> 00:15:08.330
declaring jihad and trying to tax people without representation.

262
00:15:08.480 --> 00:15:11.240
That that's how Bosnian Serbs felt about friends.

263
00:15:11.570 --> 00:15:15.380
Virgin Nan's visit to Sarajevo all that spring room as swelled that Ferdinand's

264
00:15:15.410 --> 00:15:19.370
visit was meant to cover up a surprise Austrian attack on Saudia as the room is

265
00:15:20.000 --> 00:15:22.070
intensifying, give relief Princip made an important decision.

266
00:15:22.430 --> 00:15:26.510
He decided to kill the Archduke. What did he and his magisterial book,

267
00:15:26.511 --> 00:15:30.230
the sleep walk as Christopher Clark suggests that the plot didn't originate with

268
00:15:30.740 --> 00:15:32.030
Princip, but with APIs,

269
00:15:32.240 --> 00:15:35.900
the shadow we had of Serbian intelligence in this telling app is new.

270
00:15:35.901 --> 00:15:39.590
The dovish Ferdinand wanted to make peace with his Balkan subjects.

271
00:15:39.590 --> 00:15:42.320
Maybe even elevating them to co-equals in his empire.

272
00:15:42.590 --> 00:15:46.760
Since this would destroy Belgrade's hopes of an independent Bosnia APIs don't

273
00:15:46.970 --> 00:15:50.300
wreck the black hand to recruit an assassin and the black hands,

274
00:15:50.420 --> 00:15:52.160
they chose principally that spring,

275
00:15:52.190 --> 00:15:55.760
Princip cupboard Vich and grab his practice target shooting in Belgrade.

276
00:15:56.000 --> 00:15:59.780
By now the Serbian capital was frothing without her age at the Archduke

277
00:15:59.910 --> 00:16:03.500
newspapers called him a dog and his wife, a filthier Bohemian hall.

278
00:16:03.650 --> 00:16:07.910
It was amid this climates of hatred that six small bombs and four revolvers went

279
00:16:07.911 --> 00:16:11.180
missing from the Serbian state hospital. On may the 27th,

280
00:16:11.270 --> 00:16:13.730
they were passed a Grillo Princip four nights later,

281
00:16:13.731 --> 00:16:16.190
the black hands underground railway smuggled,

282
00:16:16.640 --> 00:16:18.350
principally his friends across the Bosnian border.

283
00:16:18.620 --> 00:16:20.390
And as work of Bosnians was helped.

284
00:16:20.420 --> 00:16:24.890
All three conspirators reached Sarajevo where they hooked up with a local cell

285
00:16:24.891 --> 00:16:27.470
from nada Bosner. As June dawned in the Capitol,

286
00:16:27.830 --> 00:16:31.790
Princip spent his nights at the grave of bogged down Zaria meditating on what

287
00:16:31.791 --> 00:16:34.070
needs to be done. And in a few short kilometers away,

288
00:16:34.400 --> 00:16:35.510
Franz Ferdinand and his wife,

289
00:16:35.511 --> 00:16:39.680
Sophie were staying at a Bosnian retreat and aware of Prince sips plans and

290
00:16:39.681 --> 00:16:42.140
perhaps the creepiest moments of this entire tale.

291
00:16:42.141 --> 00:16:46.670
They made a Candescent trip to Sarajevo on June the 25th to wonder around the

292
00:16:47.210 --> 00:16:49.430
bizarre unknown to them. Princip just happened to be there.

293
00:16:49.640 --> 00:16:53.300
The teenage boy trailed them like a shadow studying their every move.

294
00:16:53.510 --> 00:16:56.660
It was the first time Princip had ever seen the Austrian act closeup.

295
00:16:56.960 --> 00:16:59.360
Sadly for Europe, it was not going to be the last

296
00:17:06.130 --> 00:17:07.390
Yes, fascination crowds.

297
00:17:07.391 --> 00:17:12.280
Thronged alongside Sarajevo's Myakka river waiting for a glimpse of the

298
00:17:12.520 --> 00:17:15.760
raw couple Prince up and disco conspirators space themselves out along the

299
00:17:16.060 --> 00:17:18.430
routes. Each carried a weapon of all moral alluded revolver.

300
00:17:18.550 --> 00:17:22.780
They also carried small pockets of Sinai. This was to be a one-way trip,

301
00:17:22.810 --> 00:17:25.210
the chance to become martyrs like Bob Dan's area.

302
00:17:25.540 --> 00:17:28.690
It's the day before it had been rainy and cool with poor visibility.

303
00:17:28.720 --> 00:17:32.260
But as Princip took up his position that morning, it was under a bright sun.

304
00:17:32.470 --> 00:17:35.200
It's possible. Principally wondered where all the gods were.

305
00:17:35.350 --> 00:17:38.500
State visits were usually accompanied by a show of military minds.

306
00:17:38.530 --> 00:17:41.470
But today there was no security. Finally, in the distance,

307
00:17:41.471 --> 00:17:44.020
the boy spotted his target just by being the assassin.

308
00:17:44.021 --> 00:17:45.100
Everyone remembers Prince.

309
00:17:45.101 --> 00:17:48.520
It wasn't actually the first in line that's on the fellows were young Bosniak

310
00:17:48.521 --> 00:17:53.160
you froze able to fire his revolver seconds came principally radical friends can

311
00:17:53.161 --> 00:17:53.994
print of it's.

312
00:17:54.060 --> 00:17:57.960
Unlike the Bosniak Bryn of its prime does bomb and threw it in Ferdinand's car.

313
00:17:57.990 --> 00:18:01.680
But the driver saw it and sped up and the bomb exploded beneath the car behind

314
00:18:01.681 --> 00:18:02.940
them in grimly,

315
00:18:02.941 --> 00:18:06.810
humorous moments of it swallowed his cyanide and trying to hurt himself into the

316
00:18:06.930 --> 00:18:07.440
mill Yaka.

317
00:18:07.440 --> 00:18:11.520
But the poison was so weak that it only scorched his throat and the river was so

318
00:18:11.521 --> 00:18:14.280
low. He simply went crashing into the bank. At this stage,

319
00:18:14.310 --> 00:18:19.200
the assassination was closer to Mr. Bean was on a terrorist attack by

320
00:18:19.770 --> 00:18:22.380
Wright's friends. Ferdinand's should have fled the city. Instead.

321
00:18:22.381 --> 00:18:25.650
Ferdinand dude stopped his guard to tend to the wounded soccer of being

322
00:18:25.651 --> 00:18:28.650
arrested. And I said, these fateful words,

323
00:18:28.920 --> 00:18:32.850
that fellow is clearly insane. Let us proceed. Meanwhile,

324
00:18:32.851 --> 00:18:34.860
I could read a principal, heard the bomb, go off,

325
00:18:34.861 --> 00:18:37.830
heard the screams and assumes the assassination that succeeded.

326
00:18:37.980 --> 00:18:41.490
He was running towards the commotion feeling of triumph already washing over

327
00:18:41.491 --> 00:18:45.390
him. When he saw the Archduke go sailing past in his car, completely unharmed.

328
00:18:45.660 --> 00:18:48.200
We can only imagine what princess thought moment,

329
00:18:48.230 --> 00:18:51.410
but we're guessing it was the Serbians equivalence of Oh.

330
00:18:52.280 --> 00:18:53.600
But it turns out that yeah,

331
00:18:53.930 --> 00:18:56.990
[inaudible] with smiling on the teenager that day as principal loitered on the

332
00:18:56.991 --> 00:18:58.700
corner of friends, Joseph streets,

333
00:18:58.701 --> 00:19:02.570
and know the story about him stopping for a sandwich simply isn't true.

334
00:19:02.690 --> 00:19:06.650
Archduke Ferdinand was in San Diego city hall demanding to be taken,

335
00:19:06.651 --> 00:19:10.490
to see the wounded local officials trying to talk him out of it and was adamant.

336
00:19:10.580 --> 00:19:14.300
So it was decided that they would change the roots just in case other assassins

337
00:19:14.301 --> 00:19:16.790
were lacking. But no one thought to tell the driver.

338
00:19:16.910 --> 00:19:20.000
And so it was that instead of carrying on, along the river,

339
00:19:20.120 --> 00:19:23.030
the car carrying Ferdinand swung onto friends, Joseph street,

340
00:19:23.390 --> 00:19:24.830
right next to freeload Princip,

341
00:19:25.160 --> 00:19:29.300
incredibly this wasn't the final thing they had to do wrong to seal Ferdinand's

342
00:19:29.690 --> 00:19:32.420
fate Princip was so astounded to see the converts in theirs.

343
00:19:32.840 --> 00:19:35.810
It wouldn't have had a chance in hell of getting a shot off the driver.

344
00:19:35.811 --> 00:19:39.590
It just kept on driving, but someone shouted, Hey, you go in the wrong way.

345
00:19:39.890 --> 00:19:43.430
So the drivers stopped right there just to meet us from Prince sip.

346
00:19:43.760 --> 00:19:47.930
As principally to told it, time seemed to slow down. He tried to use his bomb,

347
00:19:47.931 --> 00:19:51.050
but it got caught in his coat. So instead he pulled out his revolver,

348
00:19:51.290 --> 00:19:54.950
ran to the car and pointed it at the couple. According to his testimony,

349
00:19:55.100 --> 00:19:58.730
he locked eyes with the Archduke security man who blinked stupidly.

350
00:19:58.940 --> 00:20:01.670
Then there was a crack followed by another sharp crack.

351
00:20:01.910 --> 00:20:05.360
Then the car was speeding away. As a crowd, fell on, Prince kicking him,

352
00:20:05.600 --> 00:20:08.330
punching him, trying to kill him in the middle of this.

353
00:20:08.690 --> 00:20:12.380
Malai Princip tried to shoot himself only to feel the gun torn out of his hands.

354
00:20:12.560 --> 00:20:15.500
He went for a cyanide, but it was kicked away. Give reload.

355
00:20:15.890 --> 00:20:17.720
Princip was very nearly lynched that morning.

356
00:20:17.721 --> 00:20:21.530
His life only saved when the policemen managed to arrest him at that moment,

357
00:20:21.830 --> 00:20:23.930
Prince still didn't know he'd been successful.

358
00:20:24.020 --> 00:20:26.750
He still didn't know that one of his two bullets had passed through your

359
00:20:27.050 --> 00:20:29.060
friend's Ferdinand's neck severing his artery.

360
00:20:29.300 --> 00:20:30.740
He didn't know that the other had Guild.

361
00:20:31.250 --> 00:20:34.340
Sophie leaving nothing of the Royal couple shortly after 11:00 AM.

362
00:20:34.370 --> 00:20:36.770
The out to the Austrian empire was pronounced dead.

363
00:20:37.100 --> 00:20:39.680
As bells began ringing across Sarajevo in morning,

364
00:20:39.860 --> 00:20:43.220
it's likely Prinsep felt some satisfaction had done the deed.

365
00:20:43.670 --> 00:20:47.410
The Archduke was dead from now on nothing would ever be the same again.

366
00:20:53.800 --> 00:20:54.060
[inaudible]

367
00:20:54.060 --> 00:20:56.850
Whole books have been received about how this one assassination sparks.

368
00:20:56.851 --> 00:20:58.800
One of the deadliest conflicts in human history.

369
00:20:59.040 --> 00:21:02.850
The super basic version is that Austria Hungary decided that the Serbian state

370
00:21:02.940 --> 00:21:06.480
had ordered the killing and invaded the Balkan kingdom. One by one, this trips,

371
00:21:06.490 --> 00:21:08.730
the switch on a complex series of alliances.

372
00:21:08.880 --> 00:21:12.900
Each bringing some new ally into the fight until the entire continent was pulled

373
00:21:12.901 --> 00:21:17.330
into what should have been a minor war. And while you know the rest of all,

374
00:21:17.760 --> 00:21:19.500
why the trenches, the gas,

375
00:21:19.890 --> 00:21:23.520
the millions upon millions dead by the time Princip was put on trial.

376
00:21:23.521 --> 00:21:26.340
On October the 17th, the sorter was already underway.

377
00:21:26.610 --> 00:21:29.550
The trial of gorilla Princip is notable for two things.

378
00:21:29.700 --> 00:21:32.550
One is that it gave him a chance to declare his motives.

379
00:21:32.640 --> 00:21:35.610
Unlike the popular image of Princip as a Serbian nationalist,

380
00:21:35.790 --> 00:21:40.230
the young man said he was a South Slavic dedicated to kicking the Austrians out

381
00:21:40.231 --> 00:21:44.040
of the Balkans. So all South Slavs could join into a single state.

382
00:21:44.190 --> 00:21:47.550
The second is just how close Princip came to getting the death penalty.

383
00:21:47.820 --> 00:21:51.510
Remember at the very start when we said no one knew if Prince had been born on

384
00:21:51.660 --> 00:21:55.380
the 13th of June or the 13th of July, 1894. Well in Austria,

385
00:21:55.560 --> 00:21:58.500
the death penalty couldn't be applied to anyone under the age of 20.

386
00:21:58.680 --> 00:22:02.940
When they committed a crime. If principal had been born on June 13th, it hang.

387
00:22:03.090 --> 00:22:06.900
If the real date was July 13th, it only go to prison. In the end,

388
00:22:06.901 --> 00:22:08.250
the court accepted the later date.

389
00:22:08.700 --> 00:22:10.980
Prince had been 19 when it shot Franz Ferdinand,

390
00:22:11.310 --> 00:22:15.090
executing him would have been against the law on October the 28th of 1914 Prince

391
00:22:15.210 --> 00:22:18.390
up and his co-conspirators were found guilty while most of his compatriots would

392
00:22:18.391 --> 00:22:19.224
hang.

393
00:22:19.260 --> 00:22:23.400
Princip was given 20 years in Terrazine fortress in modern day Czech Republic,

394
00:22:23.460 --> 00:22:25.140
but don't go thinking he got off lightly.

395
00:22:25.200 --> 00:22:26.970
The Austrians wanted Prince up to suffer.

396
00:22:27.240 --> 00:22:30.810
He was kept in isolation and ordered to go without food for one day,

397
00:22:30.811 --> 00:22:34.590
every month by now, Princip was already showing signs of the tuberculosis,

398
00:22:34.620 --> 00:22:35.580
eating away at his system.

399
00:22:36.030 --> 00:22:39.300
Now one doubted that the Sickler young man would be dead before the end of the

400
00:22:39.320 --> 00:22:42.330
sentence. The principal was dead. Even before the end of the war,

401
00:22:42.690 --> 00:22:47.040
give you a Prince that died on April the 28th, 1918 age, just 23,

402
00:22:47.190 --> 00:22:50.190
less than seven months later in November, 1918,

403
00:22:50.220 --> 00:22:54.570
Austria Hungary completely collapsed going the same way as both Imperial Russia

404
00:22:54.900 --> 00:22:55.830
and the ultimate empire.

405
00:22:55.920 --> 00:22:59.640
By now around 20 billion people had died as the war ended.

406
00:22:59.850 --> 00:23:02.550
Bosnia joined with Serbia, Croatia, Slovenia,

407
00:23:02.730 --> 00:23:05.550
and Montenegro into a single state. Two years later,

408
00:23:06.020 --> 00:23:09.150
Principia remains work returned to Surrey over where he was buried as a hero,

409
00:23:09.570 --> 00:23:12.450
but principally reputation didn't stay settled for long.

410
00:23:12.630 --> 00:23:14.010
During the post-war decades.

411
00:23:14.011 --> 00:23:18.120
When Prince dream of a United South Slav nation was an actual real thing called

412
00:23:18.121 --> 00:23:21.390
Yugoslavia. The teenager assassin was celebrated as an icon,

413
00:23:21.630 --> 00:23:24.570
but then Yugoslavia collapsed in the early 1990s.

414
00:23:24.571 --> 00:23:28.110
And Princip came to be seen as a dangerous Serb nationalist,

415
00:23:28.111 --> 00:23:32.850
a forerunner of monsters like Ratko Nottage in Sarajevo.

416
00:23:32.910 --> 00:23:35.490
The Memorial to him was destroyed during the Bosnian war.

417
00:23:35.670 --> 00:23:38.100
By the time the dust settled on that gruesome conflict,

418
00:23:38.250 --> 00:23:42.390
local views on Principia basically depended on ethnicity ironically for a pan

419
00:23:42.391 --> 00:23:44.250
South Slav nationalist. Today,

420
00:23:44.400 --> 00:23:47.990
it's only the Serbs who celebrate celebrating the Bosniaks and Crow outs mostly

421
00:23:48.410 --> 00:23:51.710
regarding as a terrorist, whatever your personal thoughts on Princip though.

422
00:23:51.890 --> 00:23:54.230
There's no doubting that he's a significant figure.

423
00:23:54.350 --> 00:23:57.860
Although we like to pretend otherwise there was nothing inevitable about world

424
00:23:57.861 --> 00:24:00.770
war one shore European war was coming,

425
00:24:00.980 --> 00:24:05.000
but it was where the continents shifting alliances lay at that precise moment

426
00:24:05.180 --> 00:24:06.140
that made it so big.

427
00:24:06.140 --> 00:24:10.160
And so deadly push the trigger back a few years to when Russia was weaker or

428
00:24:10.490 --> 00:24:13.550
forward a few years to when the dovish Franz Ferdinand would have been on the

429
00:24:13.551 --> 00:24:17.690
Austrian throne. And that war might've looked really, really different.

430
00:24:17.840 --> 00:24:19.850
Sometimes history changes slowly.

431
00:24:20.120 --> 00:24:23.810
Sometimes it turns on great moments for gorilla Princip,

432
00:24:23.870 --> 00:24:26.510
the penniless teenage boy from a peasant backgrounds.

433
00:24:26.720 --> 00:24:30.950
It was his destiny to stand at the heart of one of those great moments to be the

434
00:24:30.951 --> 00:24:35.930
axis around which the future briefly turned as he fired two shots that hot July

435
00:24:35.931 --> 00:24:37.970
day. So many decades ago,

436
00:24:38.300 --> 00:24:41.510
his moment in the spotlight of history may have only lasted a handful of

437
00:24:41.511 --> 00:24:42.020
seconds,

438
00:24:42.020 --> 00:24:46.940
but it was more significant than the lives of Kings and presidents who spend

439
00:24:46.970 --> 00:24:50.570
decades there for that reason, if no other is short,

440
00:24:50.571 --> 00:24:54.680
life deserves to be remembered. So I do hope you found that video. Interesting.
