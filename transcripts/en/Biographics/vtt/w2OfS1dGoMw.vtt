00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:25.790
American inventor, Thomas Edison is often quoted as saying,

8
00:00:25.791 --> 00:00:29.910
genius is 2% inspiration and 98%

9
00:00:30.190 --> 00:00:31.590

which comes in part from a 1902 issue of scientific American has a

11
00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:40.950
clear message. Pure brain power is nothing without hard work and motive.

12
00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:45.220
Our protagonist today had quite a bit of both inspiration and perspiration.

13
00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:50.300
He even liked to read scientific American filo Farnsworth was the Tony stark

14
00:00:50.301 --> 00:00:50.940
of his time,

15
00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:55.180
a natural born tinkerer and visionary who identified what he wanted to invent

16
00:00:55.200 --> 00:00:59.700
and wasted little time before completely shocking the world from his Marke

17
00:00:59.701 --> 00:01:03.250
invention to protracted legal air and substance abuse problems.

18
00:01:03.360 --> 00:01:08.290
This is the quiet, brilliant life of Faloon worth. The electric whiz

19
00:01:15.170 --> 00:01:19.250
Filo Taylor Farmsworth was born in the American west in a rural community in

20
00:01:19.650 --> 00:01:20.483
Southwest in Utah.

21
00:01:20.730 --> 00:01:25.440
He was born to Louis Edwin farm and Serena Amanda Bastian on August the

22
00:01:25.760 --> 00:01:30.480
19th, 19 0 6, 40 years after Butch casidy had been born in the same town beaver,

23
00:01:30.790 --> 00:01:32.400
like a lot of other towns in Utah.

24
00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:36.000
Beaver was a small community with the ubiquitous ties to the Mormon church.

25
00:01:36.220 --> 00:01:40.240
Unlike a lot of other small towns in Utah, beaver was an electrified community.

26
00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:45.190
Small was beaver had active mining and manufacturing economies and enjoyed

27
00:01:45.191 --> 00:01:47.110
access to industrialized transportation.

28
00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:51.870
<v 1>Since the 1870s, courtesy of the Utah Southern railroad extension,</v>

29
00:01:51.880 --> 00:01:55.510
those features were enough to catch the attention of prominent Western engineer,

30
00:01:55.890 --> 00:02:00.190
Lu nun who began planning and building a hydroelectric power plant right around

31
00:02:00.191 --> 00:02:01.870
the time of funds Worth's birth.

32
00:02:02.290 --> 00:02:05.780
The result was that beaver was the first town in all of Utah to enjoy the

33
00:02:05.781 --> 00:02:08.660
benefits of widespread electric, power science and religion.

34
00:02:08.850 --> 00:02:12.340
<v 0>Both had big effects on the shaping of the young life of filo.</v>

35
00:02:12.400 --> 00:02:13.460
The church of LA today,

36
00:02:13.461 --> 00:02:17.300
saints shaped him and his two brothers and two sisters and many of the

37
00:02:17.301 --> 00:02:18.740
communities that they all grew up in,

38
00:02:18.741 --> 00:02:22.500
but it was arguably science that had the larger effect either from his early

39
00:02:22.820 --> 00:02:26.850
exposure to electric in beaver, or perhaps just sheer natural curiosity,

40
00:02:27.220 --> 00:02:31.650
Farnsworth, gravitated towards electrical interests and a tinker his mindset.

41
00:02:32.190 --> 00:02:34.290
He was an avid reader of scientific American.

42
00:02:34.520 --> 00:02:35.930
<v 1>Even at a young age,</v>

43
00:02:36.690 --> 00:02:40.810
filo Farnsworth was sketching out plans on how to completely revolutionize the

44
00:02:41.010 --> 00:02:44.320
electric world. He wasn't old enough to get drafted into world war one,

45
00:02:44.340 --> 00:02:48.680
but he was old enough to start sketching out plans for a new kind of television

46
00:02:48.870 --> 00:02:52.240
that relied solely on electric parts. At age 12,

47
00:02:52.340 --> 00:02:56.840
the Farmsworth family left Utah ought to move to a 240 acre ranch near rig

48
00:02:57.120 --> 00:02:57.580
beyond Ahoe.

49
00:02:57.580 --> 00:02:59.200
<v 0>And even by his early adolescent,</v>

50
00:02:59.550 --> 00:03:03.840
it's not hyperbole to say that Farnsworth was already something of an electrical

51
00:03:03.841 --> 00:03:07.080
genius like FARs Worth's former community in Utah,

52
00:03:07.220 --> 00:03:09.560
the Rigby ranch was wired for electricity,

53
00:03:09.620 --> 00:03:13.880
and it had generated the powered much of the farm equipment Farnsworth studied

54
00:03:13.980 --> 00:03:15.400
and reverse engineered everything.

55
00:03:15.600 --> 00:03:19.390
Teaching himself the nuts and bolts of how all the items worked.

56
00:03:19.570 --> 00:03:21.990
He became the Ranch's unofficial electrician,

57
00:03:22.220 --> 00:03:25.150
rewinding arm and repairing generators.

58
00:03:25.370 --> 00:03:29.070
On some nights he would intentionally crash the Ranch's electrical system just

59
00:03:29.071 --> 00:03:31.670
so he could repair it and reboot it. One,

60
00:03:31.671 --> 00:03:34.150
2002 book by Paul kins,

61
00:03:34.151 --> 00:03:37.790
a story of how Farmsworth converted his mother's crank powered washing machine

62
00:03:38.180 --> 00:03:43.140
into an electro powered one long distance conversations with relatives over a

63
00:03:43.141 --> 00:03:47.140
new electronic telephone only poured gasoline on the fire.

64
00:03:47.480 --> 00:03:51.460
By the time he was 14, filo was excited to take science classes,

65
00:03:51.940 --> 00:03:55.660
enter Rigby high school though one does have to wonder the value of such classes

66
00:03:56.100 --> 00:04:00.050
for a self starting genius like Farnsworth while his teachers worth doing their

67
00:04:00.051 --> 00:04:03.490
best to provide an early 20th century backgrounds in scientific literacy.

68
00:04:03.580 --> 00:04:08.130
Farnsworth was literally sketching out diagrams on how to build brand new,

69
00:04:08.131 --> 00:04:10.970
never before invented electronic equipment in their classes.

70
00:04:11.350 --> 00:04:14.850
He even showed his diagrams to one of his teachers. Mr. Toman, I wonder,

71
00:04:14.990 --> 00:04:17.130
do you automatically get an a in high school physics?

72
00:04:17.190 --> 00:04:20.720
If you can invent an entirely new kind of cat third radio tube

73
00:04:26.770 --> 00:04:30.520
Farnsworth finished his high school career at Brigham young high school.

74
00:04:30.760 --> 00:04:33.880
Laughter his family moved back to Utah during his later teenage years.

75
00:04:33.930 --> 00:04:37.680
Truthfully Farnsworth really had not thought about much of anything else besides

76
00:04:37.900 --> 00:04:42.630
how to invent a new electronic television as his adolescence wore on the idea

77
00:04:42.631 --> 00:04:43.590
began to consume him.

78
00:04:43.690 --> 00:04:48.310
The only thing that successfully snapped him out of his one track focus was the

79
00:04:48.311 --> 00:04:52.670
death of a parent. His father Lewis died in January of 1924,

80
00:04:53.350 --> 00:04:55.190
filo graduated high school, five months later,

81
00:04:55.870 --> 00:04:59.750
za Farnsworth looking to start a quick career as the eldest male and take care

82
00:04:59.751 --> 00:05:03.100
of the rest of his family applied to the United States Naval academy,

83
00:05:03.240 --> 00:05:07.140
unsurprisingly the up and coming electronics master posted one of the country's

84
00:05:07.141 --> 00:05:08.860
best entrance exam scores.

85
00:05:08.960 --> 00:05:12.420
The military track was just what the doctor warded for a Farnsworth family that

86
00:05:12.421 --> 00:05:14.700
was struggling to make ends meet without patriarch,

87
00:05:14.760 --> 00:05:18.660
but there was one major problem that Farnsworth discovered shortly after joining

88
00:05:18.680 --> 00:05:19.280
the Navy,

89
00:05:19.280 --> 00:05:23.530
any patterns he might register for while a service would automatically become

90
00:05:23.770 --> 00:05:26.210
property of the us government for a guy like Farnsworth,

91
00:05:26.211 --> 00:05:29.410
who was clearly on the brink of a slew of electronic breakthroughs.

92
00:05:29.640 --> 00:05:31.330
This was a pretty major roadblock.

93
00:05:31.331 --> 00:05:34.850
Farnsworth talked his way out of his Navy commitments by utilizing an obscure

94
00:05:34.851 --> 00:05:38.450
provision that allows the eldest child of a fatherless family to leave the

95
00:05:38.451 --> 00:05:42.840
service and return home as a familiar caregiver, return to the family,

96
00:05:42.850 --> 00:05:46.960
which was now living in Provo and began attending Brigham young university.

97
00:05:47.140 --> 00:05:49.760
As you might imagine, his course load was heavy on the sciences,

98
00:05:49.761 --> 00:05:53.280
particularly chemistry and physics, knowing he was an Nu mere beginner.

99
00:05:53.281 --> 00:05:57.480
He tried to jump straight into advanced courses, which BYU would not allow.

100
00:05:57.740 --> 00:06:00.360
He didn't care though. He attended the classes. Anyway,

101
00:06:00.410 --> 00:06:03.280
Farnsworth only stayed at BYU for a few semesters,

102
00:06:03.300 --> 00:06:06.280
but he still got two important things out of attending the school.

103
00:06:06.540 --> 00:06:09.680
For one thing, he got to play around in the college research labs,

104
00:06:09.770 --> 00:06:14.280
which he used to earn a radio nutrition certificate from the national radio

105
00:06:14.310 --> 00:06:15.960
Institute. More importantly,

106
00:06:16.020 --> 00:06:20.230
he met Provo high school student Elma Gardner while he was there and they got

107
00:06:20.231 --> 00:06:24.710
married on may the 27th, 1926. He was 19. She was 18.

108
00:06:24.890 --> 00:06:29.070
The newly words moved to California where aspiring scientist filo set up his

109
00:06:29.071 --> 00:06:33.790
first lab in San Francisco at 202 green street long before the boom and

110
00:06:33.791 --> 00:06:34.790
bustle of Silicon valley.

111
00:06:34.791 --> 00:06:39.300
Farmsworth had designs on completely revolutionizing what electronics could do

112
00:06:39.520 --> 00:06:41.100
for an average American household.

113
00:06:41.440 --> 00:06:45.700
And it's probably here that I should pause on FARs Worth's story and give you

114
00:06:45.701 --> 00:06:50.140
some context on what exactly it was that Farnsworth was trying to do.

115
00:06:50.320 --> 00:06:54.620
The idea of television was not invented by Farnsworth or anyone else in the 20th

116
00:06:54.621 --> 00:06:55.000
century.

117
00:06:55.000 --> 00:06:59.530
It was an idea deep in the roots of the eight hundreds long before Farmsworth

118
00:06:59.531 --> 00:07:04.130
was an erstwhile idea in his young parents heads shortly after the invention of

119
00:07:04.131 --> 00:07:05.330
the Telegraph scientists,

120
00:07:05.530 --> 00:07:08.610
that crafted upgrades that allowed them to transmit still images.

121
00:07:08.640 --> 00:07:12.650
Naturally this flash the potential for a device that could scan and project

122
00:07:12.710 --> 00:07:15.650
images in the 1870s, British Telegraph operator,

123
00:07:15.651 --> 00:07:20.160
Joseph made discovered that selenium responded electronically to light photo and

124
00:07:20.161 --> 00:07:24.320
that more light elicited, a stronger electronic response. Some 10 years later,

125
00:07:24.600 --> 00:07:29.400
a pian engineer living in Germany named Paul Nico theorized a kind of

126
00:07:29.401 --> 00:07:31.200
mechanical forerunner to the television.

127
00:07:31.340 --> 00:07:34.480
It was a pair of spinning discs and a photo electric mosaic.

128
00:07:34.540 --> 00:07:38.120
And they could work in concert to project an image onto a clear glass plate.

129
00:07:39.030 --> 00:07:40.750
NCO obtained a patent for this device,

130
00:07:40.751 --> 00:07:44.950
which came to be known as the nip cow disc, but he never actually built one.

131
00:07:45.130 --> 00:07:48.590
The next 40 years of TV history were marked by scores of aspirational

132
00:07:48.910 --> 00:07:52.830
scientists, chasing Nico's version of what television might look like.

133
00:07:52.920 --> 00:07:55.270
Farnsworth was following a completely different path.

134
00:07:55.530 --> 00:07:59.460
He had complained to teachers years earlier that most everyone was about

135
00:07:59.461 --> 00:08:03.140
inventing the television wrong. And in San Francisco, he had the time,

136
00:08:03.400 --> 00:08:07.180
the knowledge and the lab space to prove it Farnsworth believed Nico's

137
00:08:07.181 --> 00:08:10.220
mechanical approach was flawed and inefficient in its place.

138
00:08:10.320 --> 00:08:14.140
He wanted to pursue an all electronic mechanism for image projection.

139
00:08:14.240 --> 00:08:17.780
To describe the difference in strategies using a more modern metaphor.

140
00:08:17.920 --> 00:08:21.490
It would be like the difference between dissembling an automobile piece by

141
00:08:21.491 --> 00:08:21.970
piece,

142
00:08:21.970 --> 00:08:25.810
then reconstructing it in a different location versus putting the car in an

143
00:08:25.930 --> 00:08:28.850
airplane and flying it to that new destination.

144
00:08:29.410 --> 00:08:31.610
Barely six months after Farmsworth had moved to California,

145
00:08:31.870 --> 00:08:34.450
he had submitted patterns for a number of key inventions,

146
00:08:34.451 --> 00:08:36.530
including an image dissect a camera tube.

147
00:08:36.531 --> 00:08:38.570
That was a major electronic breakthrough.

148
00:08:38.720 --> 00:08:43.720
That was January of 1927 by September Farnsworth had successfully

149
00:08:43.721 --> 00:08:48.360
built and tested on the entire operational system transmitting a simple image of

150
00:08:48.680 --> 00:08:51.360
a straight line to a television receiver in the next room,

151
00:08:51.880 --> 00:08:56.760
true to form Farnsworth. Reportedly explained there you are electric television.

152
00:08:57.100 --> 00:09:00.240
It was as if he had known his whole life that he would invent it.

153
00:09:00.460 --> 00:09:02.720
His laboratory assistance were stunned.

154
00:09:03.110 --> 00:09:06.960
This point he was barely 21 a year later on September. The third,

155
00:09:07.200 --> 00:09:10.600
1928 funds worth had perfected his system enough that he was ready to give an

156
00:09:10.760 --> 00:09:13.320
official demonstration to the press. In 1929,

157
00:09:13.321 --> 00:09:15.830
he removed the last mechanical go parts from the system,

158
00:09:15.840 --> 00:09:19.030
fulfilling his vision of an all electronic television machine.

159
00:09:19.290 --> 00:09:23.550
He began using it to transmit more complex images, not just lines or symbols,

160
00:09:23.570 --> 00:09:25.150
but photos of actual people.

161
00:09:25.370 --> 00:09:28.950
One of the first images he chose to transmit was an image of his wife.

162
00:09:29.190 --> 00:09:33.070
Armor Farnsworth had not created some never before seen machine after all silent

163
00:09:33.071 --> 00:09:37.180
movies where popular in the 1920 is before the great depression and talkies

164
00:09:37.310 --> 00:09:39.620
broke out onto the scene in 1927.

165
00:09:39.840 --> 00:09:43.300
But Farnsworth had created a vision of what the future was going to look like.

166
00:09:43.480 --> 00:09:45.420
Not a mechanical television machine,

167
00:09:45.440 --> 00:09:48.380
but one that ran completely on modern electronic technology.

168
00:09:48.760 --> 00:09:52.220
His new series of patterns laid out the blueprints for what 20th century

169
00:09:52.270 --> 00:09:57.170
television and by extension modern entertainment would look like FAS Worth's

170
00:09:57.171 --> 00:10:00.810
vision, brought him a lot of fame and re reput in the scientific community.

171
00:10:00.880 --> 00:10:05.170
Unfortunately it also brought in one of the chief conflicts of his entire life,

172
00:10:05.690 --> 00:10:09.770
a turf war with RCA. And just before we get into that turf war,

173
00:10:09.790 --> 00:10:12.490
I'd love to take a moment to tell you about Squarespace,

174
00:10:12.830 --> 00:10:15.130
the sponsor of today's video. Now, a couple of simple things,

175
00:10:15.180 --> 00:10:18.360
maybe you've got an, an idea for a website or a business,

176
00:10:18.361 --> 00:10:22.720
even an invention up there in your head and you're thinking, Hmm,

177
00:10:22.721 --> 00:10:23.880
maybe I should try that.

178
00:10:23.910 --> 00:10:27.880
Well to the only way to figure out if it's worth doing is to get it out there to

179
00:10:27.881 --> 00:10:30.960
the world. Although if you're doing an invention, you know,

180
00:10:31.250 --> 00:10:34.240
maybe consider patents first, not a lawyer on that one,

181
00:10:34.460 --> 00:10:38.270
but Squarespace can still be incre incredibly useful if you're starting a

182
00:10:38.430 --> 00:10:40.350
business, but this can all be daunting because you know,

183
00:10:40.351 --> 00:10:42.310
it's scary to go and pursue new things,

184
00:10:42.450 --> 00:10:45.950
but not being able to set up a website is not an excuse.

185
00:10:45.950 --> 00:10:48.830
There are no excuses available with Squarespace.

186
00:10:48.831 --> 00:10:51.990
Squarespace allows you to create a powerful website for whatever you're up to

187
00:10:52.470 --> 00:10:53.990
wanna sell something online. Yes.

188
00:10:54.340 --> 00:10:58.260
Easy to set up a store with Squarespace or starting podcast. Well,

189
00:10:58.310 --> 00:10:59.980
absolutely Squarespace do that.

190
00:10:59.981 --> 00:11:03.740
It all starts on Squarespace with a beautiful template that you customize to

191
00:11:03.741 --> 00:11:08.500
your heart's contempt or start from scratch or easily move over from an

192
00:11:08.740 --> 00:11:11.020
existing domain, making everything super easy to manage,

193
00:11:11.120 --> 00:11:15.260
but don't start from scratch. Just use a template, no excuses.

194
00:11:15.560 --> 00:11:18.890
And once you've gone through the super easy customization process,

195
00:11:18.980 --> 00:11:22.610
there are no updates, no patches, no tech be asked to deal with.

196
00:11:22.611 --> 00:11:25.770
And Squarespace also handles all of the websitey stuff. Like I say,

197
00:11:25.771 --> 00:11:30.210
they do podcasts, but they also do social media integrations, mailing lists,

198
00:11:30.710 --> 00:11:32.570
all that jazz. Like I say,

199
00:11:32.571 --> 00:11:36.930
Squarespace removes the obstacles to your dreams,

200
00:11:37.510 --> 00:11:40.760
go to square com for a free trial. And when you're ready to launch go to

202
00:11:45.560 --> 00:11:47.920
our website or a domain and let's get back to it.

203
00:11:48.220 --> 00:11:50.920
So I really hope you found that. So I really hope you found that.

204
00:11:51.140 --> 00:11:55.360
So I really hope you found that. So I really hope you found that in the 1930s,

205
00:11:55.410 --> 00:11:59.720
Farnsworth was dragged into a heated, prolonged pattern war with RCA.

206
00:11:59.900 --> 00:12:01.320
But before we get into all of that,

207
00:12:01.321 --> 00:12:04.760
we need to introduce one of far Worth's chief adversaries,

208
00:12:04.830 --> 00:12:09.640
Russian American immigrants and inventor Vladimir Warkin Zu Warkin was born

209
00:12:09.700 --> 00:12:14.270
in 1888. I Miam Russia as east of present day Moscow.

210
00:12:14.370 --> 00:12:18.230
He studied at the St Petersburg Institute of technology and completed some

211
00:12:18.231 --> 00:12:21.870
post-graduate work in Paris before serving in the Russian signal core during

212
00:12:21.871 --> 00:12:24.150
world war. I, when the Russians civil war broke out,

213
00:12:24.330 --> 00:12:28.390
he immigrated to America much like his younger American counterparts Warkin was

214
00:12:28.391 --> 00:12:30.190
fascinated with the idea of television.

215
00:12:30.410 --> 00:12:35.180
He found work as a scientist with the west house laboratories in Pittsburgh and

216
00:12:35.320 --> 00:12:39.420
was eventually afforded the opportunity to work on perfecting a television

217
00:12:39.421 --> 00:12:40.380
system of his own.

218
00:12:40.440 --> 00:12:44.980
He filed for mechanical patents for smaller derivative television parts in 1923.

219
00:12:45.240 --> 00:12:47.140
And again, in 1925,

220
00:12:47.370 --> 00:12:51.380
just two years before Farnsworth gave his own public demonstration in 1928,

221
00:12:51.740 --> 00:12:55.810
as Warkin gave a demonstration of his own mechanical system in 1926,

222
00:12:55.860 --> 00:12:58.450
which his employers at Westinghouse considered a failure,

223
00:12:58.910 --> 00:13:03.770
his bosses told him to consider moving away from television and refocusing on

224
00:13:03.771 --> 00:13:06.770
problems that were considered to have more practical applications.

225
00:13:07.030 --> 00:13:11.090
He did what his bosses asked filing patterns for unrelated scientific bits and

226
00:13:11.120 --> 00:13:16.120
bobs in 1929 Zukin was not natural born genius like Farnsworth was,

227
00:13:16.220 --> 00:13:18.360
but he wasn't exactly adult either.

228
00:13:18.460 --> 00:13:21.880
He earned a PhD from the university of Pittsburgh in 1926,

229
00:13:21.881 --> 00:13:24.000
he had pioneered an improved cath radio,

230
00:13:24.090 --> 00:13:27.840
which would become a critical component for many 20th century television sets.

231
00:13:28.060 --> 00:13:32.760
And he created a new type of electronic receiver called a Kscope in 1929.

232
00:13:32.960 --> 00:13:37.150
Speaking about it at a, for the Institute of radio engineers.

233
00:13:37.470 --> 00:13:40.110
So war's profile in the field, eventually drew the attention,

234
00:13:40.470 --> 00:13:42.870
a fellow Russian American David Sonoff,

235
00:13:42.871 --> 00:13:46.630
who was operating as the president of the radio corporation of America.

236
00:13:47.310 --> 00:13:49.270
Sonoff offereds war a job in 1930,

237
00:13:49.271 --> 00:13:53.070
giving him an explicit chance to concentrate on what he failed to do.

238
00:13:53.290 --> 00:13:57.900
As a side project Westing house build an all electronic television set.

239
00:13:58.380 --> 00:14:02.100
Zu Warkin took the job in the spring of 1930, but before he moved shops,

240
00:14:02.200 --> 00:14:07.100
he took a visit to the lab of a brilliant west coast electronics engineer named

241
00:14:07.610 --> 00:14:10.020
well, you guest it filo Farnsworth,

242
00:14:10.900 --> 00:14:14.860
Zukin left Farnsworth lab impressed with a number of his electronic inventions,

243
00:14:14.861 --> 00:14:19.010
including mid dissect Warwick focused on trying to recreate it,

244
00:14:19.110 --> 00:14:20.890
but he could never get it quite right.

245
00:14:20.940 --> 00:14:24.810
Eventually after war waved the white flag and took his research in another

246
00:14:24.811 --> 00:14:29.050
direction, RCA resorted to different tactics in 1931,

247
00:14:29.070 --> 00:14:32.850
it tried to buy the rights to far Worth's patents often for a hundred thousand

248
00:14:32.851 --> 00:14:35.730
dollars and incorporate his lab as a new wing of their company.

249
00:14:36.190 --> 00:14:37.440
When he refused their Rafa,

250
00:14:37.640 --> 00:14:41.640
the RCA was ready to take a Boulder and a less friendly approach. Now,

251
00:14:41.641 --> 00:14:45.160
for those of you, who've seen the popular 2008 Marvel film Ironman.

252
00:14:45.161 --> 00:14:48.640
This plot might feel a bit familiar, a young tech genius invents,

253
00:14:48.641 --> 00:14:52.280
a brilliant new technology that's set to revolutionize the world while a

254
00:14:52.281 --> 00:14:55.720
corporate antagonist tries to acquire the technology for his own ends.

255
00:14:55.860 --> 00:14:59.160
If you've seen the film, you won't be surprised to learn what happens next.

256
00:15:00.240 --> 00:15:01.600
RCA decides to play dirty.

257
00:15:01.850 --> 00:15:06.400
David Sonoff RCA never attacked Farmsworth with a giant mechanized robot suit

258
00:15:06.401 --> 00:15:07.440
over Malibu beach,

259
00:15:07.660 --> 00:15:11.590
but they did launch a series of lawsuits aimed at resting control of Farnsworth,

260
00:15:11.591 --> 00:15:13.230
totally legitimate patterns.

261
00:15:13.450 --> 00:15:18.310
The first wave was an interference claiming that wars 1923 patent for an image

262
00:15:18.311 --> 00:15:20.590
dissector should be given priority over Farnsworth.

263
00:15:20.850 --> 00:15:25.470
And RCA was correct about one things war had in fact filed a patent for a dos

264
00:15:25.710 --> 00:15:26.950
dissector in 1923,

265
00:15:26.951 --> 00:15:30.270
but there was zero evidence that he had actually produced a functioning one

266
00:15:30.480 --> 00:15:33.540
until well after his visit to far Worth's lab,

267
00:15:34.040 --> 00:15:38.340
RCA was hoping some combination of legal intimidation and dumb luck would lands

268
00:15:38.460 --> 00:15:42.820
them control of far Worth's unreplicated electronic inventions, but in 1934,

269
00:15:42.821 --> 00:15:45.940
the us patent office ruled in favor of Farnsworth.

270
00:15:46.360 --> 00:15:49.940
RCA continued to pursue its strategy of industrial ESP arch throughout the

271
00:15:50.100 --> 00:15:50.621
1930s,

272
00:15:50.621 --> 00:15:54.650
filing new cases and appeals that dragged the conflict out all the way to the

273
00:15:54.651 --> 00:15:56.930
brink of America's involvement in world war II.

274
00:15:57.180 --> 00:16:00.890
Farnsworth never had too much to worry about legally as his patents were well

275
00:16:00.891 --> 00:16:04.690
organized and explicit, but the ongoing battle with RCA did SAP him of time,

276
00:16:04.970 --> 00:16:08.330
resources and money among the many absurd activities Farnsworth was required to

277
00:16:08.331 --> 00:16:11.850
do while defending his patents was spent several weeks tracking down his old

278
00:16:12.040 --> 00:16:14.000
school teacher, Justin Toman,

279
00:16:14.020 --> 00:16:18.400
to whom he had told of his future invention Toman recall in as much detail as he

280
00:16:18.401 --> 00:16:22.320
could a Blackboard diagram for image dissectors and CA radios,

281
00:16:22.321 --> 00:16:25.440
that Farnsworth would go on to file a pattern. For years later,

282
00:16:25.530 --> 00:16:29.560
eventually RCAs legal pursuits caught up with them and it ran out of options.

283
00:16:29.730 --> 00:16:33.830
David Sonoff desperately wanted his company to be known as the inventors of

284
00:16:33.831 --> 00:16:37.710
electronic television. Instead on September the 15th, 1939,

285
00:16:37.850 --> 00:16:42.270
he paid Farnsworth $1 million in royalties for 10 years of access to his

286
00:16:42.271 --> 00:16:45.830
patents, his legal history ons didn't just cost RCA money.

287
00:16:45.831 --> 00:16:49.190
Either Farnsworth had signed a deal with at and T more than two years later,

288
00:16:49.430 --> 00:16:54.420
allowing both parties mutual use of each other's patents auto did RCA lose

289
00:16:54.421 --> 00:16:55.540
the patent water Farnsworth,

290
00:16:55.560 --> 00:16:59.300
but they weren't even the first major company to win the use of his electronic

291
00:16:59.301 --> 00:17:00.134
genius.

292
00:17:05.870 --> 00:17:09.380
Farnsworth spent plenty of time on the defensive in the 1930s,

293
00:17:09.400 --> 00:17:11.340
but he played a fair bit of offense too.

294
00:17:11.400 --> 00:17:15.570
He traveled abroad quite often in certain of new partners that would help fund

295
00:17:15.571 --> 00:17:16.610
his legal battles,

296
00:17:16.611 --> 00:17:21.290
but he was also striking new deals and crafting new inventions. In 1934,

297
00:17:21.350 --> 00:17:24.570
he made an agreement with the Germans to provide them with electronic video

298
00:17:24.571 --> 00:17:25.850
equipment. As a result,

299
00:17:25.851 --> 00:17:30.650
some of Farnsworth image dissector cameras helped broadcast the famous 1936

300
00:17:30.651 --> 00:17:31.570
Olympic games in Berlin.

301
00:17:31.900 --> 00:17:35.520
Farnsworth continued to advance his war work with electronic televisions,

302
00:17:35.590 --> 00:17:39.560
inventing new upgrades and pieces that stabilized and advanced the fledgling

303
00:17:39.561 --> 00:17:43.440
technology. His pattern record shows scores of new electron multiplier,

304
00:17:43.510 --> 00:17:46.840
high power, projection tools, CA radios and absorption oscillators,

305
00:17:46.900 --> 00:17:50.760
and all kinds of other early modern tools that help set the stage for a century

306
00:17:50.940 --> 00:17:52.080
of small screen entertainment.

307
00:17:52.380 --> 00:17:55.920
It was around this time when CO's weekly ran a feature on far worth,

308
00:17:55.940 --> 00:18:00.800
noting that electrically scanned television was largely given to the world by a

309
00:18:01.080 --> 00:18:02.440
19 year old boy from Utah.

310
00:18:02.540 --> 00:18:05.880
The article goes on to say that today barely 30 years old,

311
00:18:06.100 --> 00:18:09.790
he is setting the specialized world of so science on its ears.

312
00:18:10.060 --> 00:18:14.270
It's easy to forget that at the close of the RCA saga in 1939,

313
00:18:14.271 --> 00:18:16.830
Farmsworth wasn't even old enough yet to run for president.

314
00:18:17.550 --> 00:18:21.430
He'd lived through so much intellectual conflict and started experimenting with

315
00:18:21.431 --> 00:18:25.550
his work at such a young age that it experienced an entire lifetime's worth of

316
00:18:25.551 --> 00:18:27.390
drama in just a few short decades.

317
00:18:27.810 --> 00:18:31.740
And Farmsworth did still have a lot of gas left in the tank in 1938.

318
00:18:31.741 --> 00:18:35.620
He founded Theon worth television and radio corporation in Fort Wayne, Indiana,

319
00:18:35.830 --> 00:18:37.900
where he worked as the director of research.

320
00:18:38.300 --> 00:18:41.460
His tinkering contributed to the invention of radar night, vision goggles,

321
00:18:41.780 --> 00:18:44.780
electron microscopes, astronomical telescopes, gas scopes,

322
00:18:44.781 --> 00:18:46.220
modern air traffic control systems,

323
00:18:46.240 --> 00:18:51.090
and more in the 1960s even created an electrical field old called a fusel that

324
00:18:51.091 --> 00:18:52.490
was capable of nuclear fusion.

325
00:18:52.750 --> 00:18:56.090
But Farnsworth began to struggle with depression and substance abuse in the

326
00:18:56.290 --> 00:18:59.290
1930s, perhaps it was the weight of his ongoing legal troubles,

327
00:18:59.310 --> 00:19:03.410
the ups and downs of securing funding and running a business or the conflicted

328
00:19:03.411 --> 00:19:07.090
nature of being a workaholic genius, who also has a wife and two kids,

329
00:19:07.610 --> 00:19:09.970
whatever his stresses were. Farnsworth reportedly had a,

330
00:19:10.120 --> 00:19:11.960
a nervous breakdown in the late 1930s.

331
00:19:12.060 --> 00:19:14.760
He moved to a quiet place in Maine at the start of world war II,

332
00:19:14.830 --> 00:19:19.440
temporarily abandoning his electronic pursuits to make wooden boxes that stored

333
00:19:19.441 --> 00:19:20.210
ammunition,

334
00:19:20.210 --> 00:19:24.840
basic tasks and simpler focus helped Farnsworth find a balance and return to its

335
00:19:24.841 --> 00:19:28.480
passions. After the war in the late 1940s, Farnsworth television and radio,

336
00:19:28.630 --> 00:19:31.510
this company based out of Indiana was struggling financially.

337
00:19:31.730 --> 00:19:35.670
It was bought out and reorganized by international telephone and Telegraph in

338
00:19:35.870 --> 00:19:36.471
1949.

339
00:19:36.471 --> 00:19:40.430
Farnsworth remains on the board as a nominal vice president and continued to

340
00:19:40.431 --> 00:19:42.550
tinker with his growing list of experiments.

341
00:19:42.610 --> 00:19:44.950
But his health continued to decline. Over the years,

342
00:19:45.130 --> 00:19:49.270
he became hyper focused on his nuclear fusion project in the 1960s,

343
00:19:49.450 --> 00:19:54.340
hoping his Fusor could become a springboard to a practical fusion reactor

344
00:19:54.580 --> 00:19:58.700
and an energy source it and T cuts his funding in 1967.

345
00:19:58.960 --> 00:20:00.820
The Farnsworth moved back to Provo,

346
00:20:00.821 --> 00:20:04.740
hoping that proximity to a university town could give him the contacts and

347
00:20:04.741 --> 00:20:06.500
funding that he would need for a new venture.

348
00:20:06.930 --> 00:20:11.500
Buty OT Farmsworth associates was bankrupt by 1970 and fines.

349
00:20:11.650 --> 00:20:14.570
A drinking problem had become more serious than ever his life,

350
00:20:14.571 --> 00:20:19.050
which had started with such bright electric promise had suddenly become twisted

351
00:20:19.350 --> 00:20:20.610
and dark RCA.

352
00:20:20.611 --> 00:20:24.050
The villain of his younger years had taken off as one of the leading creators of

353
00:20:24.070 --> 00:20:25.050
radios and televisions,

354
00:20:25.080 --> 00:20:29.530
utilizing farms Worth's patterns to become a dominating force that greatly

355
00:20:29.531 --> 00:20:31.810
surpassed his own companies market profile.

356
00:20:32.140 --> 00:20:35.760
He felt as though his work with fusion remains unfinished with the era of

357
00:20:35.761 --> 00:20:37.720
independent scientists, passing him by,

358
00:20:38.060 --> 00:20:42.320
he may have even felt sort of like a Relic of simpler times when hydroelectric

359
00:20:42.550 --> 00:20:44.760
dams lit up quaint Western towns,

360
00:20:44.780 --> 00:20:49.000
and people could only dream of watching the news in three dimensions.

361
00:20:49.380 --> 00:20:50.840
His health was clearly failing him,

362
00:20:50.841 --> 00:20:55.600
but he was given one last victory before the end of his life in 1969 in the

363
00:20:55.601 --> 00:21:00.040
aftermath of the it and T closure far worth remained unsure of the value of his

364
00:21:00.041 --> 00:21:00.580
legacy.

365
00:21:00.580 --> 00:21:04.680
He had spent his life chasing the scientific pursuits that had stimulated his

366
00:21:04.681 --> 00:21:08.430
sense of curiosity only to find conflict and depression.

367
00:21:08.570 --> 00:21:12.990
He wondered if his life's work had really been worth it. Then on July the 20th,

368
00:21:13.230 --> 00:21:14.000
1969,

369
00:21:14.000 --> 00:21:18.750
Farnsworth was one of the 500 million people watching live on television as near

370
00:21:18.751 --> 00:21:21.150
Armstrong and buzz Rin walked on the moon.

371
00:21:21.490 --> 00:21:25.830
He WEPS telling his wife that watching such an incredible events on the device

372
00:21:25.831 --> 00:21:30.740
that he visual is and invented has made a door worthwhile less than two

373
00:21:30.741 --> 00:21:34.940
years later. Farnsworth died of pneumonia on March the 11th, 1971.

374
00:21:35.160 --> 00:21:39.060
He was 64 years old. FI's wife Elma survived her husband by decades,

375
00:21:39.240 --> 00:21:42.220
living beyond the millennium until her death. In 2006,

376
00:21:42.480 --> 00:21:46.620
she spent most of the 35 years without her husband advocating for his legacy,

377
00:21:47.260 --> 00:21:51.090
challenging RCAs claims to the television throne and fighting for meaningful

378
00:21:51.091 --> 00:21:52.730
recognition for filo,

379
00:21:52.930 --> 00:21:56.730
as technology continued to evolve at a faster and faster pace.

380
00:21:56.870 --> 00:21:58.090
Thanks to her good work.

381
00:21:58.091 --> 00:22:02.370
Farnsworth is widely credited today as the electronics genius that he was

382
00:22:02.400 --> 00:22:06.650
several prominent awards are named after him, including a primetime engineering,

383
00:22:06.810 --> 00:22:09.400
Emmy award, a Midwestern and cable TV competition,

384
00:22:09.540 --> 00:22:11.600
and a collegiate broadcasting scholarship.

385
00:22:11.740 --> 00:22:15.600
He was Postly inducted into the national inventor hall of fame and the

386
00:22:15.601 --> 00:22:19.080

387

state of Utah in the us Congress scientific American called him one of the 10

389
00:22:27.840 --> 00:22:31.710
greatest mathematic of his generation and time named him as one of the hundred.

390
00:22:31.740 --> 00:22:36.630
Most influential people of the 20th century Faloon worth may have struggled

391
00:22:36.631 --> 00:22:40.550
to see his own value in his later years, as we all do from time to time,

392
00:22:40.850 --> 00:22:44.030
but he never struggled to visualize his life's greatest work.

393
00:22:44.210 --> 00:22:48.590
And he revolutionized news entertainment, art and communication in the process.

394
00:22:49.200 --> 00:22:52.420
He truly was the Tony stark of his time.
