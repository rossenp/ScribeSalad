4
00:00:16.580 --> 00:00:18.890
How far would you go to right a wrong,

5
00:00:18.891 --> 00:00:23.660
to correct an injustice to do what your conscience insists must

6
00:00:23.720 --> 00:00:25.250
be done for Roger casement,

7
00:00:25.280 --> 00:00:28.700
this journey took him to darkest Africa and the jungles of Peru.

8
00:00:28.820 --> 00:00:32.870
Some of the most primitive areas on earth were supposedly civilized.

9
00:00:32.871 --> 00:00:36.140
Europeans committed the most heinous crimes against their inhabitants.

10
00:00:36.290 --> 00:00:38.210
All in the name of profits for this,

11
00:00:38.240 --> 00:00:40.490
he was lauded as a hero and given a Knight to its best.

12
00:00:40.640 --> 00:00:43.760
His conscious then sent him to a much darker place.

13
00:00:43.970 --> 00:00:48.410
His desire to free his own country of islands from British rule led him to

14
00:00:48.411 --> 00:00:52.830
collaborate with Britain's world war one, enemies, and ultimately to rebellion.

15
00:00:58.790 --> 00:00:59.180
<v 1>[Inaudible].</v>

16
00:00:59.180 --> 00:01:02.720
<v 0>Roger David casement was born on September the first 1864 in Dublin,</v>

17
00:01:02.721 --> 00:01:05.150
Ireland to a Protestant father and to Catholic mother,

18
00:01:05.210 --> 00:01:09.470
captain Roger casement of the British army as the former and Jefferson after his

19
00:01:09.471 --> 00:01:12.860
mother's death in 1873, the family moved to County Andrew.

20
00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:17.000
And what is now Northern Ireland? Four years later, his father died in casement,

21
00:01:17.001 --> 00:01:18.890
was sent to Liverpool to live with the family.

22
00:01:18.891 --> 00:01:22.010
It was maternal aunt grace banister. After finishing school.

23
00:01:22.011 --> 00:01:25.070
He joined a shipping company as a Clark and in 1884,

24
00:01:25.071 --> 00:01:28.250
he secured a position as a purser on a ship to Africa.

25
00:01:28.460 --> 00:01:30.470
He made three more trips within a year.

26
00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:34.700
He fell in love with the exotic land Seesaw and joins the African international

27
00:01:34.701 --> 00:01:38.720
association as a severe mapping regions of the dark continent. Previously,

28
00:01:38.721 --> 00:01:39.890
unknown to Westerners,

29
00:01:46.160 --> 00:01:49.670
Unbeknownst to casements at the time was that the African international,

30
00:01:49.730 --> 00:01:52.010
it was a friend's company for King Leopold.

31
00:01:52.011 --> 00:01:55.640
The second of Belgium magazine in his private interests nods on behalf of the

32
00:01:55.641 --> 00:01:59.450
Belgian government. There was rubber in the Congo to feed the launch endeavor,

33
00:01:59.451 --> 00:02:02.720
increasing demand for bicycle and automobile tires.

34
00:02:02.721 --> 00:02:06.830
And for many other industrial uses while they are casement became friends with a

35
00:02:06.831 --> 00:02:10.010
young riverboat pilot named Joseph caused any of ski,

36
00:02:10.011 --> 00:02:13.790
even sharing accommodations for a time because any officer said that meeting

37
00:02:13.791 --> 00:02:16.550
casement was one of the few good things that had happened to him.

38
00:02:16.551 --> 00:02:17.690
While in Africa later,

39
00:02:17.720 --> 00:02:21.260
Joseph would shortened his name and Anglicised it as Joseph Conrad.

40
00:02:21.320 --> 00:02:25.100
And he wrote the best known book of that period in the Congo heart of darkness,

41
00:02:25.101 --> 00:02:29.540
in which the Ambra Kurtz is a greater Savage than any citizen of Africa.

42
00:02:29.690 --> 00:02:32.870
Casement soon learns many of the local languages. And in 1892,

43
00:02:32.871 --> 00:02:36.050
he went to work for the Nigeria coast protectorate, where he, again,

44
00:02:36.080 --> 00:02:38.480
served as a surveyor. And you know, the posts,

45
00:02:38.870 --> 00:02:41.750
his reports from the region earns him appointments to the foreign office.

46
00:02:41.810 --> 00:02:45.230
After a spell in England, recovering from illness, he was sent to West Africa

47
00:02:51.410 --> 00:02:53.900
In 1895, a man named Charles Stokes,

48
00:02:53.901 --> 00:02:57.320
a British citizen was convicted of illegally selling guns to Africans and was

49
00:02:57.321 --> 00:02:59.740
hanged. The next day, when this news reached person,

50
00:02:59.741 --> 00:03:03.580
it caused such an outcry that's casements by then console Bomer,

51
00:03:03.700 --> 00:03:07.300
and the Congo free state was instructed to compile a detailed report of the

52
00:03:07.301 --> 00:03:09.760
situation. If you've seen our video on King kingdom, Paul,

53
00:03:09.770 --> 00:03:10.603
the second of Belgium,

54
00:03:10.630 --> 00:03:14.410
you know what he found the Belgiums had forced the indigenous population into

55
00:03:14.411 --> 00:03:18.700
slavery and we're systematically working them to death. Leopold's private army.

56
00:03:18.701 --> 00:03:22.270
The force public was responsible for beating production quotas.

57
00:03:22.360 --> 00:03:24.610
It ultimately grew to nearly 20,000 men.

58
00:03:24.670 --> 00:03:28.150
Hostages would taken their lives linked to the amount of rubber gathered.

59
00:03:28.210 --> 00:03:30.460
If it was insufficient, they could be killed.

60
00:03:30.760 --> 00:03:34.270
One frequent punishment was the amputation of the right hands. Originally,

61
00:03:34.271 --> 00:03:36.250
this was intended to keep down costs.

62
00:03:36.280 --> 00:03:38.830
Leopold insisted the bullets should not be wasted.

63
00:03:39.160 --> 00:03:42.460
He insisted that each shot should kill. So if every bullet fives,

64
00:03:42.461 --> 00:03:45.220
the right-hand of the victim was returned as proof.

65
00:03:45.310 --> 00:03:47.800
If the shooter failed to kill its target or simply missed,

66
00:03:47.830 --> 00:03:50.110
they still owed Leopold. A right hands.

67
00:03:50.140 --> 00:03:52.630
One would be taken from whoever was nearby.

68
00:03:52.750 --> 00:03:55.360
Large baskets of separate hands became a common site.

69
00:03:55.690 --> 00:03:58.960
Whipping and mutilation were common punishments for even small offenses.

70
00:03:59.080 --> 00:04:02.230
Killings were frequent in some areas due to violence and disease.

71
00:04:02.231 --> 00:04:07.030
The population declines by more than 90% over 10 years and

72
00:04:07.031 --> 00:04:11.770
compiling his report. Casement relied not only on what he himself hadn't seen,

73
00:04:11.771 --> 00:04:15.730
but gathered over 20 pages of eyewitness testimony about what was occurring in

74
00:04:15.731 --> 00:04:16.330
the Congo.

75
00:04:16.330 --> 00:04:20.020
It was one of the first documents of human rights abuses in the less developed

76
00:04:20.021 --> 00:04:24.280
worlds. And it marks the beginning of the end of the Congo free state.

77
00:04:24.490 --> 00:04:27.790
Its publication was met with outrage throughout Europe and the United States.

78
00:04:27.790 --> 00:04:30.460
And there was a great pressure on Leopold in Belgium.

79
00:04:30.461 --> 00:04:33.730
A commission was formed to look into the charges and it confirms them.

80
00:04:33.850 --> 00:04:37.930
And in 1908, the Congo free state was purchased from the polls by Belgium.

81
00:04:38.260 --> 00:04:41.080
And the worst of the offenses came to an end for his work.

82
00:04:41.110 --> 00:04:44.500
Casement was named to the order of Saint Michael and Saint George.

83
00:04:44.740 --> 00:04:49.120
He returns to islands on the even 1904 and would remain there for over a year.

84
00:04:49.180 --> 00:04:52.300
It was then that he began to show an interest in Irish nationalism,

85
00:04:52.420 --> 00:04:57.400
perhaps the accesses of colonialism that had seen awakened a desire to be free

86
00:04:57.460 --> 00:04:59.500
of English overlord ship. By this time,

87
00:04:59.920 --> 00:05:02.560
Ireland had been ruled by English Kings for almost 400 years,

88
00:05:02.561 --> 00:05:05.380
but still retained an independent cultural identity.

89
00:05:05.381 --> 00:05:09.280
And many of the Irish wished for an independent political identity as well,

90
00:05:09.490 --> 00:05:11.380
casement would soon be among them.

91
00:05:11.620 --> 00:05:15.220
He joins the Gaelic league and encouraged the use of the Irish language.

92
00:05:15.221 --> 00:05:19.990
And in 1905 joins a new political party called shin Fein dedicated to an Ireland

93
00:05:19.991 --> 00:05:20.860
free of British

94
00:05:27.630 --> 00:05:30.630
Basement, resumed his career with the foreign office in 1906.

95
00:05:30.660 --> 00:05:33.870
He was sent to Brazil where he held a number of positions before finally

96
00:05:33.871 --> 00:05:37.320
becoming console general in Rio de Janeiro in 1909.

97
00:05:37.321 --> 00:05:40.650
He received reports of the mistreatment of natives in the upper reaches of the

98
00:05:40.651 --> 00:05:43.710
Amazon river, near the Peruvian city of a ketose. Once again,

99
00:05:43.711 --> 00:05:45.960
the cause was the thriving trade in rubber.

100
00:05:46.020 --> 00:05:49.560
Most of the population of Peru was located on the Western coast of South

101
00:05:49.561 --> 00:05:52.290
America, between the Pacific ocean and the Andes mountains.

102
00:05:52.490 --> 00:05:56.430
It keep those lay on the Eastern side of the Andes in the Amazon rainforest.

103
00:05:56.490 --> 00:06:00.740
It was so that rather than this area was shipped eastward down the Amazon nearly

104
00:06:00.741 --> 00:06:02.870
2000 miles to the Atlantic ocean.

105
00:06:02.930 --> 00:06:05.690
And it can you tell us the Peruvian governments listen to authority.

106
00:06:05.750 --> 00:06:08.780
Instead the Peruvian Amazon company exercised control.

107
00:06:08.810 --> 00:06:12.050
It was a British from the board of directors and many stockholders were all

108
00:06:12.051 --> 00:06:16.010
British, but it was run by Julio says Araunah Peruvian citizen.

109
00:06:16.100 --> 00:06:20.540
Some of those mistreated were citizens of Barbados and therefore of the British

110
00:06:20.541 --> 00:06:22.880
empire, which gave casements a reason to intervene.

111
00:06:22.940 --> 00:06:26.540
He traveled to the region in both 1910 and 1911. Once again,

112
00:06:27.080 --> 00:06:30.950
compiling a thorough report of abuses. It was much the same as in the Congo,

113
00:06:31.010 --> 00:06:32.690
the distance from governments, authorities,

114
00:06:32.780 --> 00:06:37.160
you might intervene meant that the PAC could do what it wished with.

115
00:06:37.190 --> 00:06:40.130
Just impunity. Again, casement wrote of what he saw,

116
00:06:40.160 --> 00:06:43.280
personal onions of what he heard from those who had been victimized.

117
00:06:43.370 --> 00:06:44.750
One common punishment stood out.

118
00:06:44.960 --> 00:06:48.590
People had their head and hands confined in wooden stocks and will have to

119
00:06:48.591 --> 00:06:51.830
standing there for days at a time. Sometimes until they died,

120
00:06:52.070 --> 00:06:56.420
whole families perished this way around his company was dissolved in 1911

121
00:06:56.450 --> 00:06:57.860
though. He was never punished.

122
00:06:57.890 --> 00:07:01.880
He later had a successful political career winning election to the Peruvian

123
00:07:01.881 --> 00:07:02.714
Senate

124
00:07:08.500 --> 00:07:12.490
In 1911, casement received a knighted for his work in the Congo and Peru,

125
00:07:12.520 --> 00:07:14.800
two years later, he returned to Ireland. Soon.

126
00:07:14.830 --> 00:07:17.710
He took up the political activities had begun eight years earlier.

127
00:07:17.800 --> 00:07:20.560
He had arrived as an important juncture a year earlier.

128
00:07:20.561 --> 00:07:23.920
The governing liberal party had lost their majority in the British parliament.

129
00:07:23.921 --> 00:07:27.190
And in order to form a government that enlisted the aid of the Irish

130
00:07:27.191 --> 00:07:29.380
parliamentary party in return for this support,

131
00:07:29.410 --> 00:07:32.620
they promised home rule to Ireland, including its own parliaments,

132
00:07:32.800 --> 00:07:37.210
but British rule was popular in the mostly Protestant counties in the North and

133
00:07:37.360 --> 00:07:39.070
to safeguards to their ties to Britain,

134
00:07:39.100 --> 00:07:42.670
the Ulster volunteers were founded a paramilitary organization,

135
00:07:42.671 --> 00:07:45.400
eventually numbering 100,000 men in response.

136
00:07:45.840 --> 00:07:49.180
Casements helped organize a rival force in the South, the Irish volunteers,

137
00:07:49.181 --> 00:07:53.920
which grew to twice that size. He traveled to the United States in July, 1914,

138
00:07:53.921 --> 00:07:57.790
in order to raise money to buy weapons while there he was fated by the Irish

139
00:07:57.791 --> 00:08:01.360
American community and mess with numbers of clam, the Gale,

140
00:08:01.361 --> 00:08:03.370
a secret society of Irish Republicans,

141
00:08:03.550 --> 00:08:06.100
but as Johnny was singing overtaken by events.

142
00:08:12.070 --> 00:08:12.750
<v 1>[Inaudible].</v>

143
00:08:12.750 --> 00:08:16.480
<v 0>Okay. Kaseman was in America at Bosnians named Carrillo, Princip assassinated,</v>

144
00:08:16.481 --> 00:08:18.400
grand jete, Franz Ferdinand, Zara parents.

145
00:08:18.450 --> 00:08:20.650
The Austro-Hungarian empire within weeks,

146
00:08:20.651 --> 00:08:24.370
Europe had stumbled into the most violent war it had ever known in this

147
00:08:24.371 --> 00:08:28.030
conflagration casements or an opportunity. Britain now had a powerful enemy.

148
00:08:28.060 --> 00:08:30.010
One whose aims aligned with his own.

149
00:08:30.340 --> 00:08:33.220
He arranged to meet with the German ambassador to the United States,

150
00:08:33.221 --> 00:08:36.950
counter Johann Heinrich, Von bernstorff, and he made him an offer.

151
00:08:37.090 --> 00:08:39.460
If Germany would supply weapons to the Irish rebels,

152
00:08:39.520 --> 00:08:41.230
they would take islands out of the war.

153
00:08:41.320 --> 00:08:45.100
It was an opportunity that the Germans couldn't ignore as that little to lose,

154
00:08:45.130 --> 00:08:46.300
they were already fighting.

155
00:08:46.301 --> 00:08:49.930
The British on rest in Ireland would distracts them into revolution that would

156
00:08:50.200 --> 00:08:54.010
ease the pressure on the front. And also the casement traveled VASH ship Fest,

157
00:08:54.011 --> 00:08:55.470
Norway, then on to Germany,

158
00:08:55.650 --> 00:08:59.220
he met with German officials and requested enough arms and men's free islands

159
00:08:59.221 --> 00:09:00.054
from British rule.

160
00:09:00.330 --> 00:09:03.390
He arranged for all Irish prisoners to be moved to a camp near Limburg,

161
00:09:03.391 --> 00:09:07.590
his efforts hampered by the Germans in ability to tell Irish from English,

162
00:09:07.710 --> 00:09:09.480
he visited them that and called upon them.

163
00:09:09.630 --> 00:09:13.650
So join the Irish brigades do throw off British rule. As of 2000 men,

164
00:09:13.860 --> 00:09:17.430
90 56 were persuaded. The rest forced him into a hasty retreat.

165
00:09:17.580 --> 00:09:19.950
When returning from a visit to the German headquarters,

166
00:09:19.951 --> 00:09:22.020
he passed by the town of van den in Belgium,

167
00:09:22.021 --> 00:09:26.970
where he sold the graves of 350 civilians who had been executed by the Germans.

168
00:09:27.120 --> 00:09:31.140
He later wrote in his diary, all that the Belgians now suffer that King,

169
00:09:31.380 --> 00:09:35.070
his government and his offices wreaked on the well nigh,

170
00:09:35.080 --> 00:09:39.750
defenseless people of the Congo basin. He worked in Germany for 18 months,

171
00:09:39.780 --> 00:09:41.790
but in the end, a little to show for it.

172
00:09:42.360 --> 00:09:44.010
Casements eventually lost faith in his hosts,

173
00:09:44.011 --> 00:09:48.900
writing this that only interestingly and exploiting me and the Irish cause no

174
00:09:48.901 --> 00:09:50.760
German soldiers would fight in Ireland.

175
00:09:50.790 --> 00:09:54.030
There would be no German officers to lead the Irish brigade.

176
00:09:54.150 --> 00:09:57.840
The 100,000 rifles that had been promised were reduced to 20,000 captured

177
00:09:57.841 --> 00:10:02.040
Russian weapons and a million rounds of ammunition, only 50 rounds per gun.

178
00:10:02.370 --> 00:10:04.050
Now just before we get into the rest of today's video,

179
00:10:04.051 --> 00:10:06.690
let me take a quick moment to tell you about today's fantastic sponsor,

180
00:10:06.691 --> 00:10:09.630
Nord VPN. Look, if you're online, you really should be using a VPN.

181
00:10:09.631 --> 00:10:12.840
And that's when Nord VPN comes in and was tempting not to Obama.

182
00:10:12.960 --> 00:10:16.050
So we just hope for the best, but really those stories you read of people,

183
00:10:16.051 --> 00:10:18.480
having their identity stolen, their data stolen,

184
00:10:18.481 --> 00:10:21.330
it does happen and you don't want it to be easy for that to be you,

185
00:10:21.331 --> 00:10:23.010
whether it's a nefarious actor,

186
00:10:23.220 --> 00:10:27.420
snipping for your private information or a company tracking your activity,

187
00:10:27.570 --> 00:10:29.820
but using a VPN can move out so much more. For example,

188
00:10:30.060 --> 00:10:32.700
North VPN lets you access to any of its thousands of servers in different

189
00:10:32.701 --> 00:10:36.540
countries, all around the globe. So if you've hit the end of your Netflix queue,

190
00:10:36.541 --> 00:10:39.660
simply try changing the location of your server to get access to content

191
00:10:39.661 --> 00:10:43.920
libraries that due to licensing arrangements are only available in specific

192
00:10:43.950 --> 00:10:47.280
geographic locations. Nord VPN is also super fast.

193
00:10:47.281 --> 00:10:50.040
So watching video is a breeze, no lag whatsoever.

194
00:10:50.041 --> 00:10:52.440
If you've ever used VPNs and thought they were slow, well,

195
00:10:52.441 --> 00:10:56.490
no more with Nord and you can use it on all of your devices. Very easily.

196
00:10:56.610 --> 00:10:57.930
Android Chrome windows,

197
00:10:58.320 --> 00:11:01.200
Lenox sand on six different devices with just one accounts.

198
00:11:01.230 --> 00:11:05.100
Also they use double data encryption for extra security and they have this thing

199
00:11:05.101 --> 00:11:07.260
called a kill switch. So if for whatever reason,

200
00:11:07.261 --> 00:11:10.260
you connect to the internet and nor VPN isn't running,

201
00:11:10.530 --> 00:11:14.160
they'll kill your internet until they've ensured that you're on a state

202
00:11:14.190 --> 00:11:15.690
connection. And if you ever get stuck,

203
00:11:15.691 --> 00:11:19.420
they've got 24 seven support to help you out. Take advantage of North specials,

204
00:11:19.421 --> 00:11:20.101
sign the deal.

205
00:11:20.101 --> 00:11:25.020
Every purchase of a two year plan gets you 68% off plus an additional month

206
00:11:25.040 --> 00:11:27.030
for free and just surprise gifts.

207
00:11:33.320 --> 00:11:33.380
<v 3>[Inaudible].</v>

208
00:11:33.380 --> 00:11:36.080
<v 0>Well, these guns and ammunition it already to policy for Ireland's a,</v>

209
00:11:36.380 --> 00:11:40.880
a German ship disguised as the Norwegian freighter SS AWD casement realized that

210
00:11:40.881 --> 00:11:44.870
without a large well-armed force, the Easter rising was doomed to fail.

211
00:11:44.871 --> 00:11:47.660
So he decided he must warn the men preparing in Ireland,

212
00:11:47.690 --> 00:11:50.420
the Germans that arranged for a submarine to accompany the Ord.

213
00:11:50.421 --> 00:11:53.980
And so casement traveled to Ireland board. You 19.

214
00:11:54.110 --> 00:11:57.970
The old was intercepted by the Royal Navy off the Southwest coast of Ireland and

215
00:11:57.971 --> 00:12:01.810
forced to sail, to Queenstown under escort. As they entered cork Harbor,

216
00:12:01.990 --> 00:12:04.930
the crew scuttled, the ships sending the arms and ammunition to the bottom.

217
00:12:05.350 --> 00:12:05.711
Casement himself,

218
00:12:05.711 --> 00:12:09.970
went to shore at trainee Bay in County Kerry on the night of the 21st of April

219
00:12:09.971 --> 00:12:12.100
three days before the uprising was to begin,

220
00:12:12.280 --> 00:12:16.120
the companions were able to land on a beach and a collapsible wooden boat.

221
00:12:16.150 --> 00:12:17.530
But during the trip from Germany,

222
00:12:17.950 --> 00:12:20.170
casement had fallen ill with a recurrence of malaria,

223
00:12:20.171 --> 00:12:23.650
which had contracted during his time in the tropics, as he was unable to travel,

224
00:12:23.651 --> 00:12:26.620
the other men helped him to a shelter at an ancient fortification Gordon

225
00:12:26.621 --> 00:12:27.460
McKenna's force,

226
00:12:27.461 --> 00:12:31.660
where he was later found by the local constabulary and arrested from jail.

227
00:12:31.690 --> 00:12:35.560
He insisted upon speaking to a priest and was allowed to see father Frank Ryans,

228
00:12:35.800 --> 00:12:38.530
whom he passed a message counseling. The uprising father,

229
00:12:38.531 --> 00:12:40.930
Ron finally delivered the message on Monday the 24th.

230
00:12:41.290 --> 00:12:42.520
But by then it was too late.

231
00:12:42.610 --> 00:12:46.120
Casement was taken to London while being interrogated by Reginald hall.

232
00:12:46.121 --> 00:12:50.110
Chief of Naval intelligence casement realized that all knew that the uprising

233
00:12:50.111 --> 00:12:50.830
was imminent.

234
00:12:50.830 --> 00:12:54.370
He begged hall to allow him to call it off and avoid unnecessary bloodshed.

235
00:12:54.700 --> 00:12:57.430
But hall refused preferring to crush the rebels.

236
00:12:57.490 --> 00:13:02.170
He said it is better than a conquering saw. Like this should be cut out.

237
00:13:02.320 --> 00:13:06.370
The Irish Republicans fought tenaciously and hung on longer than anyone could

238
00:13:06.430 --> 00:13:10.390
have expected. But by Saturday it was all over. As casement had foreseen,

239
00:13:10.630 --> 00:13:12.490
there'd been outnumbered and tout guns though.

240
00:13:12.491 --> 00:13:14.770
They put up a tenacious defense in the ends.

241
00:13:14.771 --> 00:13:17.980
They were unable to resist the British army. After perfunctory trials,

242
00:13:17.981 --> 00:13:20.050
14 of the rebels were executed by firing

243
00:13:27.420 --> 00:13:29.190
Straw for trees and began on June the 26th.

244
00:13:29.220 --> 00:13:33.090
The prosecution witness included men who Kaseman to try to recruit from the

245
00:13:33.091 --> 00:13:34.350
German prisoner of war camp,

246
00:13:34.470 --> 00:13:38.430
who testified that he asked them to join his Irish brigade as well as the

247
00:13:38.431 --> 00:13:39.990
policemen from Shirley Bay,

248
00:13:40.020 --> 00:13:43.620
who gave evidence about his arrival in capture no less a person than playwright.

249
00:13:43.621 --> 00:13:46.830
George Bernard Shaw urged casement to use his defense,

250
00:13:46.831 --> 00:13:50.940
to make the case for Irish home rule and even prepared a text for him to use

251
00:13:51.210 --> 00:13:52.050
case men considered this.

252
00:13:52.051 --> 00:13:55.740
But in the end was persuaded to allow his lawyer to argue that by the wording of

253
00:13:55.741 --> 00:13:58.080
the law, the statute from the time of Edward, the third,

254
00:13:58.470 --> 00:14:00.270
he had committed no crime. His lawyer,

255
00:14:00.360 --> 00:14:04.050
Alexander Martin Sullivan argued that the law prohibited actions against the

256
00:14:04.051 --> 00:14:07.560
King only in his realm, great Britain and the toll of casements,

257
00:14:07.561 --> 00:14:11.280
admittedly treasonous act to cut in Germany. This strategy back father,

258
00:14:11.310 --> 00:14:14.790
the court after examining the 500 year old document determined that there was a

259
00:14:14.791 --> 00:14:18.600
calmer in the text that meant his actions against Britain treasonous,

260
00:14:18.601 --> 00:14:20.670
anywhere in the world. Before the lawyers began,

261
00:14:20.671 --> 00:14:23.730
the summations casement was allowed to read a statement to the court.

262
00:14:23.880 --> 00:14:26.310
He said that he had gone from Germany, not to England,

263
00:14:26.340 --> 00:14:29.940
but to islands and that any crimes had committed had been done there.

264
00:14:29.970 --> 00:14:32.460
And that if he were to be tried by a jury of his peers,

265
00:14:32.670 --> 00:14:36.420
it should be an Irish jury. Deliberations were brief in less than an hour.

266
00:14:36.430 --> 00:14:38.040
Casement was found guilty of treason.

267
00:14:38.160 --> 00:14:41.220
It's difficult to see how the jury could have decided otherwise by his own

268
00:14:41.221 --> 00:14:44.130
admission, he had conspired with his country's enemy. During war time,

269
00:14:44.580 --> 00:14:46.530
there was this old, he could say in mitigation,

270

the judges Dawn's the black caps that meant a death sentence and pronounced that

271
00:14:50.640 --> 00:14:54.320
Roger would hang casement was formerly stripped of his nighters.

272
00:14:54.330 --> 00:14:55.430
On June the 30th.

273
00:14:55.490 --> 00:14:59.180
He filed an appeal which was heard on July the 17th after a day and a half of

274
00:14:59.181 --> 00:15:00.110
testimony. It was rejected.

278
00:15:13.991 --> 00:15:18.460
signed by GK Chesterton, John Goldsworthy, and many other prominent people.

steadfast in that support one man who was not was casements old friends,

282
00:15:29.140 --> 00:15:33.640
Joseph Conrad, whose son Borys was serving at the fronts. In addition,

283
00:15:33.641 --> 00:15:35.500
the British had to consider the public opinion,

284
00:15:35.501 --> 00:15:38.470
especially in the United States though, officially neutral.

285
00:15:38.471 --> 00:15:40.390
The U S was generally friendly to Britain,

286
00:15:40.391 --> 00:15:43.330
but casement was very popular that in 1912,

287
00:15:43.331 --> 00:15:47.110
he'd met president Taft ans on his later trip to raise money for the Irish

288
00:15:47.111 --> 00:15:48.790
volunteers had made many friends,

289
00:15:48.820 --> 00:15:52.420
the large Irish American community that was sympathetic to his course.

290
00:15:52.840 --> 00:15:56.710
He was compared favorably in the press that 19th century abolitionist John Brown

291
00:15:56.711 --> 00:15:59.080
executed for his attempt to lead a slave uprising.

292
00:15:59.380 --> 00:16:03.130
The Easter rising had been covered extensively by the U S newspapers,

293
00:16:03.190 --> 00:16:04.770
April the 29th, New York times.

294
00:16:04.840 --> 00:16:07.450
It included no fewer than 18 separate items about it.

295
00:16:07.750 --> 00:16:11.410
Doyle's petition mentioned that casements execution would be used as a weapon

against us in the United States and press Baron.

297
00:16:14.231 --> 00:16:16.600
William Randolph Hearst used his newspapers,

298
00:16:16.601 --> 00:16:20.350
the San Francisco examiner in the New York morning journal to urge that the

299
00:16:20.351 --> 00:16:23.260
death sentence be commuted to life in prison. But in Britain,

300
00:16:23.290 --> 00:16:26.020
public opinion was dead set against him. On July. The first,

301
00:16:26.021 --> 00:16:30.280
the British had launched their main attack for 1916 across the som river in

302
00:16:30.880 --> 00:16:34.000
Northwestern, France times to collide with attacks by its allies.

303
00:16:34.330 --> 00:16:36.100
It succeeded in pushing back the Germans,

304
00:16:36.130 --> 00:16:38.980
but at a horrific cost on the first day of the battle,

305
00:16:39.010 --> 00:16:42.310
nearly 20,000 British troops were killed. And twice that number wounded,

306
00:16:42.700 --> 00:16:43.570
there was little sympathy.

307
00:16:49.570 --> 00:16:49.750
<v 1>[Inaudible].</v>

309
00:16:53.471 --> 00:16:56.020
Victoria's reign ended with a death in 1901,

310
00:16:56.021 --> 00:16:58.600
but the force of Victorian morality, it was undiminished.

311
00:16:58.930 --> 00:17:02.500
All school walls had been imprisoned for gross and decency 20 years before.

312
00:17:02.501 --> 00:17:03.760
And even 40 years later,

313
00:17:03.761 --> 00:17:07.630
Codebreaker ran and tiering was convicted of the same offense and forced to take

314
00:17:07.631 --> 00:17:10.900
hormone treatments leading to a suicide. After casements arrest,

315
00:17:10.901 --> 00:17:13.150
a set of diaries was found among his belongings.

316
00:17:13.180 --> 00:17:17.080
These diaries contained a record of a sexual encounters going back many years

317
00:17:17.560 --> 00:17:18.580
and explicit language.

318
00:17:18.640 --> 00:17:21.550
The British governments had photographs made of a number of pages.

319
00:17:21.551 --> 00:17:24.940
And these were quietly circulated among those concerned, in the case,

320
00:17:24.941 --> 00:17:27.910
including Doyle shore, the Archbishop of Canterbury and King George,

321
00:17:27.911 --> 00:17:31.300
the fifth American ambassador Walter Page was shown the diaries.

322
00:17:31.390 --> 00:17:34.330
He wrote to Washington, this much information about him,

323
00:17:34.360 --> 00:17:38.200
of an unspeakably filthy character was withheld from publicity.

324
00:17:38.320 --> 00:17:41.650
Doyle at least was unimpressed. So told her the diary is content.

325
00:17:41.770 --> 00:17:45.760
So you said no possible sexual offense could be as bad as supporting soldiers

326
00:17:45.761 --> 00:17:47.680
from their duty. But in those days,

327
00:17:47.681 --> 00:17:52.410
homosexuality provoked a sort of discuss that Millie betraying your country

328
00:17:52.830 --> 00:17:57.300
apparently did not in the end, Doyle straw and others were not deterred,

329
00:17:57.330 --> 00:18:00.210
but many who learned the details of his private life changed their opinions of

330
00:18:00.211 --> 00:18:03.330
the man and may have tipped the balance towards his execution.

331
00:18:09.320 --> 00:18:09.560
<v 1>[Inaudible].</v>

332
00:18:09.560 --> 00:18:13.280
<v 0>Though consumed with Wallwork the British cabinet discuss casements fate no less</v>

333
00:18:13.281 --> 00:18:14.990
than five times after its conviction.

334
00:18:15.170 --> 00:18:18.470
The contents of the black diaries appear to have eased the moral qualms.

335
00:18:18.471 --> 00:18:21.470
Some had about executing him in the meeting on August. The second,

336
00:18:21.471 --> 00:18:23.420
it was decided that there would be no reprieve.

337
00:18:23.600 --> 00:18:26.870
Casement was informed that it would be hanged in the next day,

338
00:18:27.020 --> 00:18:30.860
that night he converted to Roman Catholicism in the morning he received the only

339
00:18:31.250 --> 00:18:32.083
he would ever hear.

340
00:18:32.240 --> 00:18:36.590
Then he was taken to the gallows and hanged by the neck until dead later,

341
00:18:36.591 --> 00:18:40.220
his body was placed in an unmarked grave in the grounds of Pentonville prison

342
00:18:40.460 --> 00:18:44.360
covered in quick lime and buried Island finally won its independence.

343
00:18:44.361 --> 00:18:45.200
Five years later,

344
00:18:45.230 --> 00:18:47.840
the counties of Northern Ireland chose to remain a part of Britain.

345
00:18:47.960 --> 00:18:50.630
Casements had been asked to be buried in Ireland,

346
00:18:50.650 --> 00:18:53.960
but it wasn't only 50 years before his body was returned to the Island of his

347
00:18:53.961 --> 00:18:54.470
birth.

348
00:18:54.470 --> 00:18:58.610
Even then it was not entered in his family home of County Antrim as the burial

349
00:18:58.611 --> 00:19:00.640
of a martyr of the Irish rebellion,

350
00:19:00.800 --> 00:19:04.220
then lawless Northern Ireland would be politically dangerous and could be

351
00:19:04.221 --> 00:19:05.990
considered as a deliberate provocation.

352
00:19:06.080 --> 00:19:09.500
Instead he was given a full state funeral and buried in the Republican blots of

353
00:19:09.501 --> 00:19:12.140
glass Hyndman cemetery in Dublin, near his comrades.

354
00:19:12.350 --> 00:19:16.910
Attending was president of the Republic of Ireland Ayman. Dillera now elderly,

355
00:19:16.911 --> 00:19:20.300
who as a young man known casement, as he stood by his grave,

356
00:19:20.301 --> 00:19:22.700
he said it required courage to do what Kaseman did.

357
00:19:22.970 --> 00:19:25.640
And his name would be honored, not merely here,

358
00:19:25.790 --> 00:19:27.920
but by oppressed peoples everywhere.

359
00:19:27.980 --> 00:19:31.550
Even if he had done nothing for the freedom of our own country.

360
00:19:32.060 --> 00:19:33.950
