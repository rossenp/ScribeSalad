Living a life of freedom on the high seas,

but not today's protagonist of a run of the coast.

12
00:00:40.700 --> 00:00:45.000
The legendary self-governance society of Buccaneers on the Island of tortilla.

13
00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:46.370
Yoga was home to many,

14
00:00:46.371 --> 00:00:51.080
a legendary scoundrel who braved the waves for the love of booty dreaming

15
00:00:51.380 --> 00:00:55.220
about a wealthy retirement, but not this guy. Oh no.

16
00:00:55.400 --> 00:00:58.430
He was a complete and utter piece of,

17
00:00:59.240 --> 00:01:02.980
he was an irredeemable criminal and a total psychopathic terrorized,

18
00:01:02.981 --> 00:01:05.930
the Caribbean looting burning, killing, and torturing.

19
00:01:05.931 --> 00:01:10.550
Whoever came across his path with a particular predilection for Spanish

20
00:01:10.580 --> 00:01:13.430
colonists, his name was Francois Orlin,

21
00:01:13.431 --> 00:01:17.270
a the most Savage pirates of the 17th century.

and viewer discretion is certainly advised.

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:36.380
<v 0>Little is known about the early years of the boy who became Francoise along a</v>

27
00:01:36.650 --> 00:01:38.480
name. We do know his exact date of birth.

28
00:01:38.481 --> 00:01:43.160
I knew that it was sometime between 1630 and 1635. We know that at birth,

29
00:01:43.161 --> 00:01:47.200
he was called John David. Now that he was born in the small town of LaSalle,

30
00:01:47.360 --> 00:01:51.500
the law in today's Vondie departments on the Atlantic coast of France.

31
00:01:51.590 --> 00:01:54.830
And we know that his parents were so poor that they were forced to sell him as

32
00:01:54.831 --> 00:01:57.590
an indentured servant when he was 15 years old,

33
00:01:57.620 --> 00:02:01.850
the teenage on David was whisked off to the other side of the Atlantic working

34
00:02:01.851 --> 00:02:04.160
first in a sugar plantation in Martinique,

35
00:02:04.310 --> 00:02:07.220
and then under Spanish masters in the Island of Hispaniola.

36
00:02:07.250 --> 00:02:10.670
This is where modern day Haiti and Dominican Republic are located for nine long

37
00:02:10.671 --> 00:02:11.990
years. Joy injured,

38
00:02:12.140 --> 00:02:16.730
a life of backbreaking work in the plantation for little or no compensation.

39
00:02:16.910 --> 00:02:20.900
He was most likely mistreated and he most likely suffered physical violence.

40
00:02:21.080 --> 00:02:22.310
I'm only speculating here,

41
00:02:22.340 --> 00:02:26.060
but it may have been this time that something snapped inside his mind.

42
00:02:26.270 --> 00:02:29.780
This is when he may have developed his latest sadistic tendencies and his

43
00:02:29.781 --> 00:02:32.840
relentless hatred of the Spanish. By the late 1650s,

44
00:02:33.470 --> 00:02:36.110
John David had earned his freedom as per his servitude contract.

45
00:02:36.320 --> 00:02:38.960
He had the option to become a farmer in Hispaniola.

46
00:02:39.050 --> 00:02:42.230
Instead he escapes that community to live among the Buccaneers.

47
00:02:42.440 --> 00:02:46.670
These Buccaneers were originally hunters who roamed the wilds of Hispaniola.

48
00:02:46.730 --> 00:02:50.600
They feasted on wild cattle and boar meat prepared in little hot school.

49
00:02:51.290 --> 00:02:53.180
Becamse and it's their name overtime.

50
00:02:53.181 --> 00:02:57.020
The name Buccaneer came to define the pirates and privateers who had found safe

51
00:02:57.021 --> 00:03:01.870
Haven on the Island of [inaudible] just North of Hispaniola air in 17th

52
00:03:01.871 --> 00:03:02.830
century writer,

53
00:03:02.831 --> 00:03:07.750
Alexandra X square merely describes Datu UGA as common refuge of all

54
00:03:07.751 --> 00:03:12.190
sorts of wickedness and the seminary as it were of pirates and

55
00:03:12.191 --> 00:03:12.880
thieves.

56
00:03:12.880 --> 00:03:17.290
This community of scallywags on the high seas became known as the brethren of

57
00:03:17.291 --> 00:03:22.120
the coaster sort of independent rogue pirate stage with its own laws and

58
00:03:22.121 --> 00:03:24.640
even a governor. When John David joined the brethren,

59
00:03:24.670 --> 00:03:27.670
the governor was one more sewer Diller. Plus incidentally,

60
00:03:27.700 --> 00:03:32.080
the newbie pirates served as a symbol Marriner on two or three voyages with more

61
00:03:32.081 --> 00:03:36.190
experienced Buccaneers. We have a few specific details on these expeditions,

62
00:03:36.191 --> 00:03:40.360
except that he developed a reputation for courage and cruelty against the enemy.

63
00:03:40.600 --> 00:03:45.040
His actions impressed MSOD Plaza gave him a new battle name,

64
00:03:45.160 --> 00:03:47.020
Francois [inaudible],

65
00:03:47.050 --> 00:03:51.160
which simply means the man from a long delay class also gave him command of a

66
00:03:51.161 --> 00:03:55.870
ship of his own as a privateer or core set serving for the French Navy. Today,

67
00:03:55.871 --> 00:03:57.640
we might be using the terms pirate,

68
00:03:57.670 --> 00:04:02.080
Buccaneer course air and privateer interchangeably. But once upon a time,

69
00:04:02.110 --> 00:04:03.340
there was a fine distinction.

70
00:04:03.430 --> 00:04:07.780
A pirate is quite simply an armed robber who works at sea attacking mainly ships

71
00:04:07.781 --> 00:04:08.614
and ports.

72
00:04:08.650 --> 00:04:12.030
A privateer on the other hand is a pirate who has been given authority by

73
00:04:12.040 --> 00:04:15.460
government to attack and pillage ships belonging to other powers.

74
00:04:15.610 --> 00:04:19.540
The government providing such authorization would receive a percentage of the

75
00:04:19.870 --> 00:04:20.050
loot.

76
00:04:20.050 --> 00:04:24.340
And so the newly-minted captain France while on the nae was the blessings of the

77
00:04:24.341 --> 00:04:28.420
governor of Tatu governs on, in direct orders from the French crown set,

78
00:04:28.421 --> 00:04:30.850
sail on his first independent voyages.

79
00:04:30.940 --> 00:04:34.870
He would soon become the scourge of the main colonial power of the Caribbean,

80
00:04:35.230 --> 00:04:36.580
the flail of the Spanish.

81
00:04:43.350 --> 00:04:43.770
<v 1>[Inaudible].</v>

82
00:04:43.770 --> 00:04:45.690
<v 0>Swells first raids at sea and not documented,</v>

83
00:04:45.691 --> 00:04:47.820
but we know that they were successful in later.

84
00:04:47.821 --> 00:04:50.700
Actions Lalani proved to be tactically savvy.

85
00:04:50.850 --> 00:04:53.520
His favorite technique was to take large ships by surprise,

86
00:04:53.521 --> 00:04:55.410
attacking them with a number of small boats.

87
00:04:55.530 --> 00:04:58.020
Sometimes he would split his forces into two units.

88
00:04:58.050 --> 00:05:01.980
One group on a larger vessel would engage in a gun battle with new prey while

89
00:05:02.520 --> 00:05:05.040
Francois himself would lead a surprise raid from canoes,

90
00:05:05.041 --> 00:05:08.910
attacking the enemy from behind he and his crew became renowned for being both

91
00:05:08.940 --> 00:05:11.670
brave and cruel. During the early 1660s,

92
00:05:11.671 --> 00:05:14.910
Spanish sailors have been on the receiving ends of the cruelty.

93
00:05:14.970 --> 00:05:17.850
At least when it came to facing Francois, Swaran just crude.

94
00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:21.570
But the Spanish Navy in the Spanish armies in the Americans were not exactly

95
00:05:21.600 --> 00:05:26.040
shrinking violets and sooner or later the empire would strike back in

96
00:05:26.041 --> 00:05:30.420
1667 Leilani's ship sank off the coast of campaign on the Yucatan

97
00:05:30.421 --> 00:05:32.160
peninsula, modern day, Mexico,

98
00:05:32.190 --> 00:05:35.670
the course Aaron Dizman disembarked and headed toward the town,

99
00:05:35.700 --> 00:05:38.940
but fell into a surprise attack prepared by Spanish troops.

100
00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:42.840
The ambush was well-prepared and the slaughter was almost entirely one-sided at

101
00:05:42.841 --> 00:05:43.501
the end of the battle.

102
00:05:43.501 --> 00:05:46.980
Most of the Buccaneers had been killed Francoise body blade among the other

103
00:05:46.981 --> 00:05:51.330
cadavers smeared in a mixture of caked in blood and sand,

104
00:05:51.480 --> 00:05:54.870
the Spanish soldiers Bally gave him a second look before congratulating

105
00:05:54.871 --> 00:05:56.010
themselves on the victory.

106
00:05:56.040 --> 00:06:00.590
But bear just for the oldest trick in the Swashbucklers book, playing dead,

107
00:06:00.770 --> 00:06:02.300
realizing that all was lost.

108
00:06:02.660 --> 00:06:04.880
And ed quickly covered his face with the blood of his own,

109
00:06:04.970 --> 00:06:09.080
that superficial wounds and rolled in the Sans to make for a more convincing

110
00:06:09.081 --> 00:06:12.050
corpse. After surviving the massacre, the Buccaneer bed,

111
00:06:12.080 --> 00:06:16.070
the body of a Spanish soldier dressed in his uniform and left campaign.

112
00:06:16.370 --> 00:06:20.450
He soon ran into group of slaves whom he convinced to give him a canoe without

113
00:06:20.451 --> 00:06:21.200
flimsy boats.

114
00:06:21.200 --> 00:06:24.530
The stubborn freshmen majored all the way back to door to gab governance.

115
00:06:25.040 --> 00:06:28.400
Coloplast must've choked on his rum when he saw the man of a lawn. Once again,

116
00:06:28.401 --> 00:06:30.920
allegedly back from the debt is excavated.

117
00:06:31.100 --> 00:06:34.220
They have increased his pirate credentials even further as he was able to

118
00:06:34.221 --> 00:06:37.940
recruit a fresh crew with his newly unkillable reputation,

119
00:06:38.120 --> 00:06:41.630
with a new crew in tow Francoise set sail on his next objective,

120
00:06:41.631 --> 00:06:46.160
the Spanish town of Los chaos on the Southern coast of Cuba with another ship

121
00:06:46.280 --> 00:06:49.940
that his command, he had more reason than ever to target his Spanish enemies.

122
00:06:50.030 --> 00:06:53.660
The incursion was spotted by fisherman who alerted the governor in the Capitol

123
00:06:54.200 --> 00:06:58.070
Havana. The governor sends a 10 gun warship mans by 90 sailors and Marines.

124
00:06:58.100 --> 00:07:01.190
It was more than enough to deal with the meager course air force.

125
00:07:01.370 --> 00:07:04.760
He must have been surprised when only one man came back alive.

126
00:07:04.850 --> 00:07:07.250
The lone survivor brought back terrible news.

127
00:07:07.280 --> 00:07:10.640
The French back in air and his men had succeeded in capturing the Spanish war

128
00:07:10.910 --> 00:07:12.830
ship taking nearly all the men prisoner,

129
00:07:13.220 --> 00:07:16.700
Lala lay had been ordered for them all to have their feet and hands tied.

130
00:07:16.760 --> 00:07:19.160
The survivors were all made to kneel in a long row.

131
00:07:19.220 --> 00:07:22.790
The French course says slowly stroll along the line of captives with a Cutlass

132
00:07:22.791 --> 00:07:25.610
in his right hand and a sharpening stone. And the other,

133
00:07:25.850 --> 00:07:29.330
the blades of the man from a law fell onto the first Spanish neck.

134
00:07:29.360 --> 00:07:31.910
Then a second, then a third without a rush.

135
00:07:31.940 --> 00:07:35.150
The captain sharpens the edge of this stone and resumed as work.

136
00:07:35.270 --> 00:07:36.950
When he finally shifted his Cutlass,

137
00:07:37.280 --> 00:07:40.070
87 suit rolled off the bridge of the warship.

138
00:07:40.340 --> 00:07:43.880
The blood thirst of the French Corsair was motivated by revenge against the

139
00:07:43.881 --> 00:07:44.421
Spaniards,

140
00:07:44.421 --> 00:07:49.220
but rage did not exactly obfuscate his cold calculating minds.

141
00:07:49.280 --> 00:07:52.400
He spared the life of one Spanish sailor and send him back to the governor.

142
00:07:52.430 --> 00:07:53.720
It was a diabolical move,

143
00:07:53.721 --> 00:07:57.590
allowing that one witness tail to strike fear into the whole of Nirvana.

144
00:07:57.650 --> 00:08:00.710
The survivor carried a message from Lola to the governor.

145
00:08:00.770 --> 00:08:04.370
I shall never hence forward give quarter to any Spaniard whatsoever.

146
00:08:04.430 --> 00:08:05.450
And I have great hopes.

147
00:08:05.451 --> 00:08:09.650
I shall execute on your own pass and the very same punishments I have done upon

148
00:08:09.651 --> 00:08:11.690
them. You sent against me, thus,

149
00:08:11.691 --> 00:08:16.250
I have retaliated the kindness you designed to me and I companions,

150
00:08:16.400 --> 00:08:18.320
but just before we get into that slaughter,

151
00:08:18.530 --> 00:08:21.890
let me tell you about today's sponsor Nord VPN. If you're online,

152
00:08:21.891 --> 00:08:24.860
you really should be using a VPN. And that's when Nord VPN comes in.

153
00:08:24.861 --> 00:08:28.400
I know it's tempting not to bother sort of just hope for the best,

154
00:08:28.401 --> 00:08:31.400
but really those stories you read about people having their data stolen,

155
00:08:31.401 --> 00:08:36.050
they do happen as well. I don't want it to be easy for that to be you,

156
00:08:36.110 --> 00:08:37.010
whether it's an affair,

157
00:08:37.460 --> 00:08:40.490
anchor snooping for your private information or companies tracking your activity

158
00:08:40.491 --> 00:08:44.420
online, protect yourself with naught, but using a VPN can be so much more.

159
00:08:44.420 --> 00:08:44.961
For example,

160
00:08:44.961 --> 00:08:48.710
Nord VPN lets you access any of its thousands of servers in different countries,

161
00:08:48.711 --> 00:08:51.890
all around the globe. So if you've hit the end of your Netflix queue,

162
00:08:51.891 --> 00:08:55.920
simply try changing the location of your server and you'll get to content

163
00:08:55.921 --> 00:08:59.700
libraries that due to licensing agreements or any available in specific

164
00:08:59.701 --> 00:09:01.020
geographic locations.

165
00:09:01.050 --> 00:09:04.560
I actually personally ran into that with mad men a while ago and a few other

166
00:09:04.561 --> 00:09:07.860
shows. So that's pretty great. Nord VPN is also super fast.

167
00:09:07.861 --> 00:09:10.560

And let's get back to the video.

178
00:09:52.100 --> 00:09:52.640
<v 2>[Inaudible].</v>

179
00:09:52.640 --> 00:09:55.370
<v 0>They had upgraded his fleet with the captured Spanish warship,</v>

180
00:09:55.400 --> 00:09:58.970
but he had little loop to speak of after roaming from port to port,

181
00:09:58.971 --> 00:10:02.240
he eventually attacked and pillaged a ship loaded with golden silver.

182
00:10:02.300 --> 00:10:05.990
After the successful heist Francois returned to his base in tore to go where the

183
00:10:06.230 --> 00:10:10.640
Gatton preparations for his most ambitious plan, yet the sack of Maracaibo,

184
00:10:10.641 --> 00:10:13.640
a wealthy Spanish colonial town in modern day, Venezuela,

185
00:10:13.760 --> 00:10:16.640
a plan likes this needed the rice manpower.

186
00:10:16.641 --> 00:10:20.990
And so Leilani issued a recruitment call. Over 400 men joins the enterprise,

187
00:10:20.991 --> 00:10:24.620
including a contingence. There was led by Mechelle the basket,

188
00:10:24.680 --> 00:10:26.690
the basket pine room was already retired by now,

189
00:10:26.720 --> 00:10:30.320
but he decided to return to the fray for one last heist. If you like.

190
00:10:30.350 --> 00:10:33.500
He had been a very skilled infantry officer before becoming a buck near.

191
00:10:33.501 --> 00:10:36.170
And so we offered to lead actions on lands.

192
00:10:36.350 --> 00:10:39.110
The expedition set sail in late April 16,

193
00:10:39.111 --> 00:10:42.320
67 during a stop on the Northern coast of Hispaniola.

194
00:10:42.500 --> 00:10:45.020
The numbers of the Buccaneers increased to 700.

195
00:10:45.380 --> 00:10:49.370
All of these fleets now fully staffed and stocked on supplies set off to America

196
00:10:49.400 --> 00:10:52.400
though on July the 30th, 1667,

197
00:10:52.490 --> 00:10:54.920
as the fleet was circumnavigating Hispaniola,

198
00:10:55.490 --> 00:10:58.340
Alani spotted a Spanish ship just off Punto Sparta,

199
00:10:58.430 --> 00:11:01.070
and what was lower than these mission statements. Well,

200
00:11:01.071 --> 00:11:03.890
no quarter to the Spaniards ends, no quarter was given,

201
00:11:03.980 --> 00:11:06.370
setting aside his main objective, the French privateer.

202
00:11:06.371 --> 00:11:09.650
I left the bulk of his fleet behind and gave chase to the Spanish ship.

203
00:11:09.770 --> 00:11:13.340
She proved to be a formidable opponent as she was armed with 16 guns.

204
00:11:13.490 --> 00:11:17.120
The Buccaneers were not deterred though. And after a battle of three hours,

205
00:11:17.121 --> 00:11:21.710
the Spanish surrendered Lola nade discovered that's the Congo was worth fighting

206
00:11:21.711 --> 00:11:26.240
for the capture job held 120,000 pounds of cocoa, but that was just the Andre.

207
00:11:26.770 --> 00:11:27.561
Bronswell also plundered,

208
00:11:27.561 --> 00:11:32.060
a huge cache of coins and Juul is equivalent to 50,000 Spanish dollars of the

209
00:11:32.061 --> 00:11:34.610
time. Our inflation calculator doesn't go back that far,

210
00:11:34.611 --> 00:11:37.880
but you can consider it an absolutely vast amounts of money.

211
00:11:37.940 --> 00:11:40.490
While Francois was raking in such copious booty,

212
00:11:40.491 --> 00:11:43.430
that remainder of his fleet had not been sitting idle.

213
00:11:43.610 --> 00:11:47.420
They had captured another Spanish ship carrying $12,000 as well as tons of

214
00:11:47.421 --> 00:11:48.620
ammunition and weapons.

215
00:11:49.360 --> 00:11:51.950
Lalani incorporated the two captured ships into his fleet,

216
00:11:52.010 --> 00:11:56.470
taking the 16 gun vessel as his flagship with the holes heavy with cash and

217
00:11:56.471 --> 00:12:01.120
weapons. The bucket is sailed on Tamara KIBO in August of 1667.

218
00:12:01.121 --> 00:12:04.840
They landed some 18 miles away from the town preparing for a surprise attack,

219
00:12:05.020 --> 00:12:07.570
but surprise it. Wasn't just the governor of Merrick.

220
00:12:08.050 --> 00:12:09.640
Who'd been warned of the pirates arrival.

221
00:12:09.670 --> 00:12:13.900
The governor was in charge of the life of 4,000 inhabitants and could count on

222
00:12:13.901 --> 00:12:18.250
800 soldiers. Maricado had been sacked by pirates twice before in 16,

223
00:12:18.251 --> 00:12:22.690
14 and 1642. That was more than enough. And the governor wouldn't let it happen.

224
00:12:22.691 --> 00:12:25.510
A third time. He divided his forces into two units.

225
00:12:25.540 --> 00:12:29.140
The first would deliver a frontal attack on the invaders while the other would

226
00:12:29.290 --> 00:12:32.680
ambush them from the rehab. What happens next would be funny if it went,

227
00:12:32.710 --> 00:12:35.710
you know, horribly violent and tragic. So yeah,

228
00:12:35.711 --> 00:12:39.700
the French pirates who wanted to take America by surprise and the Spanish

229
00:12:39.701 --> 00:12:43.570
stealth attack party who wanted to take the pirates by surprise.

230
00:12:43.600 --> 00:12:45.820
Eventually a group of pirates led by Miguel.

231
00:12:45.821 --> 00:12:50.410
The Basque discovered the Spanish ambushes and detect them by surprise the

232
00:12:50.411 --> 00:12:52.780
Spanish soldiers retreated to the Fort of Maracaibo,

233
00:12:52.781 --> 00:12:57.610
located some miles outside of the main town Francoise near how the baskets that

234
00:12:57.611 --> 00:13:01.660
combined rate as besieged the Fort for three hours eventually capturing the

235
00:13:01.661 --> 00:13:05.050
barracks, the whole plan of the governor. It was going South,

236
00:13:05.110 --> 00:13:08.680
some survivors of the ambush party. He managed to reach Mariko with news.

237
00:13:08.680 --> 00:13:11.920
That 2000 pirates were about to pillage the town. That's right.

238
00:13:11.950 --> 00:13:13.420
They said two thousands,

239
00:13:13.570 --> 00:13:17.890
not the actual 700 inevitably panic spread like a plague. Now,

240
00:13:17.891 --> 00:13:21.550
considering Francois's previous tactic of allowing one survivor to escape,

241
00:13:21.700 --> 00:13:24.160
one may wonder if the soldiers who spread the panic,

242
00:13:24.280 --> 00:13:28.270
it's actually been set free by the crafty core SAP, whatever the truth,

243
00:13:28.300 --> 00:13:31.210
the consequences, plaids in Alana's favor,

244
00:13:31.420 --> 00:13:36.040
citizens of Maracaibo evacuated on mass weakening the defenses of the town,

245
00:13:36.070 --> 00:13:39.070
grabbing whatever boat they found. So they quickly sell to Gibraltar. No,

246
00:13:39.071 --> 00:13:40.030
not the one in Spain,

247
00:13:40.031 --> 00:13:44.650
but a namesake town on the Southeast shore of Lake maricado with all the

248
00:13:44.651 --> 00:13:45.490
resistance gone,

249
00:13:45.790 --> 00:13:49.690
all Hernandez fleet sailed into the Harbor and then marched into America though,

250
00:13:49.691 --> 00:13:52.200
without a fight, as per tradition of the Buccaneers,

251
00:13:52.480 --> 00:13:55.240
all in his small army divided their Luton equal parts,

252
00:13:55.360 --> 00:13:59.500
but it was a disappointing booty at this stage consisting only of food and

253
00:13:59.501 --> 00:14:03.820
household items. Lala need the basket. Everyone else wanted the Spanish gold,

254
00:14:03.850 --> 00:14:05.470
but no way could they find it.

255
00:14:05.530 --> 00:14:08.620
They had no idea where the citizens had gone with their valuables.

256
00:14:08.650 --> 00:14:13.060
The frustrated camps in sends 160 of his men into the forests around maricado

257
00:14:13.061 --> 00:14:14.020
looking for prisoners.

258
00:14:14.200 --> 00:14:17.650
They returned with 20 soldiers in shackles and will all in a,

259
00:14:17.740 --> 00:14:19.360
had a ways to make them talk.

260
00:14:26.070 --> 00:14:26.270
<v 2>[Inaudible].</v>

261
00:14:26.270 --> 00:14:30.270
<v 0>As unfortunate prisoners were tied up to a wooden rack and subjected to torture</v>

262
00:14:30.750 --> 00:14:34.080
all in a personally performed his favorite agony inducing methods.

263
00:14:34.140 --> 00:14:36.240
One of these activities, it was known as wielding.

264
00:14:36.360 --> 00:14:39.990
This first consisted of tying a rope around the head of a prisoner by twisting a

265
00:14:40.000 --> 00:14:43.860
short wooden sticks that rope would tighten its grip similar to the Spanish

266
00:14:44.280 --> 00:14:44.480
GoRat app.

267
00:14:44.480 --> 00:14:48.090
The pressure on the skull and temples of the captives with assumption that the

268
00:14:48.091 --> 00:14:50.520
eyes would eventually pop out of their sockets.

269
00:14:51.030 --> 00:14:53.840
Another method was simply to cut out the tongue of the victim.

270
00:14:54.050 --> 00:14:56.360
Certainly it did not help the poor guy talk,

271
00:14:56.390 --> 00:15:00.200
but it sure motivated as companions to reveal any information that they might be

272
00:15:00.201 --> 00:15:02.540
sitting on. The last torture worth mentioning,

273
00:15:03.050 --> 00:15:07.010
consisted of slowly slicing a prisoner to pieces, full view of the others all,

274
00:15:07.130 --> 00:15:09.170
and they would start with a small slice first.

275
00:15:09.170 --> 00:15:11.510
Then he gradually increased the size of the carts.

276
00:15:11.511 --> 00:15:13.820
Eventually hacking off entire limbs.

277
00:15:13.880 --> 00:15:17.420
Eventually somebody talked and revealed that most towns folk had fled to

278
00:15:17.421 --> 00:15:19.370
Gibraltar lower than eight letters, man,

279
00:15:19.490 --> 00:15:22.610
to Gibraltar carrying out another surprise attack via the plans.

280
00:15:22.790 --> 00:15:25.490
The Spanish in Gibraltar had been readying some defenses,

281
00:15:25.491 --> 00:15:28.880
but the majority of their weapons had been left at the Fort plus they did not

282
00:15:28.881 --> 00:15:31.700
expect an attack on foot from the swamp side of that position.

283
00:15:31.820 --> 00:15:35.060
At the end of the fierce battle, 40 pirates lay dead and DT wounded.

284
00:15:35.120 --> 00:15:37.970
The losses on the other side had been much worse,

285
00:15:37.971 --> 00:15:42.110
500 dead and an unreported number of wounded to later died of sepsis,

286
00:15:42.200 --> 00:15:45.620
the hunger of the Buccaneers at not been seated by this victory.

287
00:15:45.650 --> 00:15:47.630
They tortured and raped the survivors,

288
00:15:47.780 --> 00:15:50.120
looted all their valuables and stole their food.

289
00:15:50.150 --> 00:15:52.340
Many of the remaining Spanish staff to death,

290
00:15:52.430 --> 00:15:54.560
the sack of Gibraltar lost at four weeks.

291
00:15:54.560 --> 00:15:58.520
And then the deranged captain Francois [inaudible] asked for more.

292
00:15:58.700 --> 00:16:01.460
He knew some Spanish refugees had been hiding in the forest.

293
00:16:01.490 --> 00:16:04.580
And so he sent word to them that he was going to burn the town.

294
00:16:04.700 --> 00:16:07.790
As they pay him $10,000. They had two days to comply.

295
00:16:07.850 --> 00:16:11.270
They finally managed to scrape the sum together on the third day. There's a lot,

296
00:16:11.410 --> 00:16:13.970
all the Ned already started to set the houses on fire.

297
00:16:14.480 --> 00:16:17.540
After the sack of Gibraltar was over Lola nail led the Buccaneers back to

298
00:16:17.541 --> 00:16:21.050
America though, and their first stand down there not found much to steal,

299
00:16:21.080 --> 00:16:23.210
but they hadn't played the rent SIM card.

300
00:16:23.211 --> 00:16:27.800
Yet Francoise sent a message to the downtrodden governor asking for $30,000 to

301
00:16:27.801 --> 00:16:31.280
prevent the town from being set on fire. After a tense negotiation,

302
00:16:31.281 --> 00:16:36.200
the French captain settled on $20,000 and 500 pieces of cattle. Lola, Nan,

303
00:16:36.201 --> 00:16:40.790
his crew of rather nasty bastards emerged from Lake Maracaibo wins into the open

304
00:16:40.791 --> 00:16:44.990
sea. After two months pillaging burning, torturing and killing. They had planted

305
00:16:46.550 --> 00:16:48.410
$260,000 as well as gems and luxury goods.

306
00:16:48.620 --> 00:16:52.580
When they returned to talk to Lola ne was probably the most notorious pirate of

307
00:16:52.581 --> 00:16:55.670
the Caribbean. Thanks to the new Leon clout and his new riches.

308
00:16:55.671 --> 00:17:00.530
He was able to prepare a new expedition in 1668 with a force of some 700

309
00:17:00.531 --> 00:17:01.364
men.

310
00:17:06.820 --> 00:17:07.420
<v 1>[Inaudible].</v>

311
00:17:07.420 --> 00:17:10.840
<v 0>By now the ones indentured seven said developed delusions of grand.</v>

312
00:17:11.140 --> 00:17:13.750
He had a master false fortune, one, almost every battle.

313
00:17:13.751 --> 00:17:15.460
He had forged conquered two towns.

314
00:17:15.700 --> 00:17:18.100
So I don't conquer a whole country for himself.

315
00:17:18.250 --> 00:17:22.240
This was the goal of his next expedition taking over the Spanish territory of

316
00:17:22.241 --> 00:17:27.040
Nicaragua. The plan of Lola was to make a landing in Cape grassy as a Dios,

317
00:17:27.041 --> 00:17:31.490
which is Spanish for thanks God. This Cape is the Eastern most tip of Nicaragua.

318
00:17:31.660 --> 00:17:34.960
We're on the Caribbean coast and it borders on modern day Honduras,

319
00:17:34.990 --> 00:17:36.280
the Corsair fleet, however,

320
00:17:36.281 --> 00:17:40.420
was taken off course by a storm and push northward into the Gulf of Thundurus.

321
00:17:40.630 --> 00:17:43.300
As the pirates waited for the weather and wind to improve,

322
00:17:43.450 --> 00:17:47.320
they decided to bide their time by pillaging the coast and their cruelty.

323
00:17:47.321 --> 00:17:50.130
The bucket is targeted smaller communities, native fishermen,

324
00:17:50.220 --> 00:17:54.210
who barely had any possessions besides that cabins and canoes all in aid.

325
00:17:54.240 --> 00:17:55.920
Then his men burns the natives,

326
00:17:55.921 --> 00:17:59.790
humble lodgings and stole their canoes effectively destroying their livelihoods

327
00:17:59.940 --> 00:18:01.560
for the sake of a very small booty.

328
00:18:01.561 --> 00:18:04.170
The French captain had sowed hatred amongst the natives.

329
00:18:04.200 --> 00:18:07.560
They would not forget this and they would spread the word after days of

330
00:18:07.561 --> 00:18:11.120
targeting fishermen, the pirates moved to strike and more formidable opponent,

331
00:18:11.130 --> 00:18:15.390
a Spanish ship armed with 20 guns, mortar Pareto to Kabyles today.

332
00:18:15.540 --> 00:18:17.340
But quarters in Honduras,

333
00:18:17.460 --> 00:18:20.340
the Buccaneers were able to quickly seize the ship itself.

334
00:18:20.700 --> 00:18:24.570
The prey that would make any pirate proud, but it wasn't enough for LOL.

335
00:18:24.710 --> 00:18:28.470
And he ordered his men to March inlands and conquer the city of San Pedro,

336
00:18:28.471 --> 00:18:31.890
some 50 kilometers or 30 miles South of Coretta to Kabyles.

337
00:18:31.920 --> 00:18:34.800
The Honduran jungle proved to be an Emerald health.

338
00:18:34.830 --> 00:18:38.610
Both the pirates and their opponents [inaudible] was frustrated by the constant

339
00:18:38.611 --> 00:18:42.060
attacks and ambushes carried out by Spanish troops hiding in the forest.

340
00:18:42.450 --> 00:18:46.170
His men came across two barricaded positions built by the Spaniards offering

341
00:18:46.171 --> 00:18:48.180
stiff resistance. In both occasions,

342
00:18:48.181 --> 00:18:51.750
they were able to slaughter the garrisons by using rudimentary hand grenades.

343
00:18:51.930 --> 00:18:56.640
Those soldiers who were not killed had a much worse feat, captivity and torture.

344
00:18:56.700 --> 00:19:00.180
This was dictated by the twisted psychia Francois, the near shore,

345
00:19:00.181 --> 00:19:01.680
but it also served a purpose.

346
00:19:01.830 --> 00:19:05.340
The captain had realized that as men were completely encircled by the Spanish

347
00:19:05.370 --> 00:19:08.490
troops, he needed to extract information on their location.

348
00:19:08.491 --> 00:19:12.970
So as to reach San Pedro avoiding further casualties, Lola Neha interrogated,

349
00:19:12.971 --> 00:19:14.700
the prisoners taken from the barricades,

350
00:19:14.730 --> 00:19:17.520
but they would not reveal the positions of their compatriots.

351
00:19:17.670 --> 00:19:19.170
The pirates went into a rage.

352
00:19:19.200 --> 00:19:23.720
We don't know if it was a foaming off URI or rather a cold blood [inaudible]

353
00:19:23.730 --> 00:19:26.630
psychopathic, malignant anger. What we do now,

354
00:19:27.170 --> 00:19:29.450
the results from swallow and a stabbed,

355
00:19:29.451 --> 00:19:32.720
one of the prisoners in the chest and launched his wound and then ripped out his

356
00:19:32.721 --> 00:19:35.240
hot as the other soldiers stand on in horror,

357
00:19:35.241 --> 00:19:37.640
the Savage pirates bit on the pulsating hot.

358
00:19:37.940 --> 00:19:41.930
And then he shoved the organ on some poor fellow's face and forced him to eat

359
00:19:41.931 --> 00:19:46.250
it. He then addressed the other prisoners. I will serve you all alike.

360
00:19:46.430 --> 00:19:50.030
If you show me not another way, the remaining captives confessed,

361
00:19:50.060 --> 00:19:52.100
there was a way out to the Spanish and sacraments,

362
00:19:52.120 --> 00:19:55.090
but it would have been very difficult to break it. After a further battle,

363
00:19:55.100 --> 00:19:57.530
the equal sander expedition managed to take San Pedro,

364
00:19:57.560 --> 00:19:58.970
but it was a Pyrrhic victory.

365
00:19:59.390 --> 00:20:02.690
That lines had been thinned by the constant harassment from the Spaniards.

366
00:20:02.691 --> 00:20:06.440
And most of the inhabitants had fled with that possessions Walden, a perhaps,

367
00:20:06.560 --> 00:20:10.040
and Pedro burns the grounds and then marched his men back to [inaudible] to

368
00:20:10.730 --> 00:20:13.280
Kabyles. The bucking is of this stage. We're close to mutiny,

369
00:20:13.281 --> 00:20:17.420
but Francois managed to keep up morale by promising a rich loot.

370
00:20:17.480 --> 00:20:21.290
One of the prisoners told him about a large Spanish ship due to arrive in

371
00:20:21.620 --> 00:20:22.730
Harbor. Within three months,

372
00:20:22.760 --> 00:20:27.440
they waited patiently until she showed up arms to the teeth with 41 guns and

373
00:20:28.220 --> 00:20:31.310
130 sailors while, and they applied a simple, yet effective tactic.

374
00:20:31.460 --> 00:20:34.690
He targeted the Spanish ship with Kennan Vaughn from the tallest buildings,

375
00:20:34.970 --> 00:20:38.570
where to the kumbaya, the artillery on board responded to the fire.

376
00:20:38.571 --> 00:20:42.440
But the Spaniards did not notice the four canoes bursting with pirates

377
00:20:42.441 --> 00:20:46.040
approaching from the starboard side, the course as boarded the ship on scene,

378
00:20:46.041 --> 00:20:50.470
taking the Spanish by surprise. When they opened the holds of the vessels,

379
00:20:50.620 --> 00:20:52.060
they were also taken by surprise.

380
00:20:52.120 --> 00:20:56.080
They ones full of gold and silver as expected with Ravo full of paper and steel.

381
00:21:00.000 --> 00:21:03.180
His appointment finally broke the crew, which splints it into three factions.

382
00:21:03.360 --> 00:21:06.120
Two groups left on de-risk. One returned to talk to God.

383
00:21:06.150 --> 00:21:09.420
The other wins around the Caribbean, seeking more ships to plunder.

384
00:21:09.480 --> 00:21:13.020
Lola a and 300 men decided to remain in the Gulf of Honduras,

385
00:21:13.050 --> 00:21:16.110
but it immediately appeared as though their luck had run out during one of their

386
00:21:16.111 --> 00:21:19.530
first outings that ship ran aground on a sandbox for six months,

387
00:21:19.670 --> 00:21:22.380
while all the Nan his men were stuck on the coast, upon the jurors,

388
00:21:22.381 --> 00:21:26.010
trying to free their ship from that trap all the while they had to defend

389
00:21:26.011 --> 00:21:29.790
themselves from the incessant attacks of the local tribes bends on revenge.

390
00:21:29.791 --> 00:21:32.490
After the early reds of Lola NAPE week after week,

391
00:21:32.491 --> 00:21:35.850
the numbers dwindled until eventually only 150 were left alive.

392
00:21:36.000 --> 00:21:38.820
Francois realized that no hopes of escaping the sandbox.

393
00:21:38.880 --> 00:21:42.210
So we had the ship dismantled and the ordered his men to build some bulges

394
00:21:42.240 --> 00:21:43.080
within new boats.

395
00:21:43.080 --> 00:21:47.070
The Buccaneers sailed South woods along the coast towards Nicaragua,

396
00:21:47.130 --> 00:21:48.750
but now in a reversal of fate,

397
00:21:48.930 --> 00:21:52.620
it was the Spaniards who gave no quarter chasing Lola.

398
00:21:52.621 --> 00:21:55.680
Now away from the territories, the Buccaneers have no choice,

399
00:21:55.681 --> 00:21:59.580
but to continue that Johnny Southwood in desperate need of food and fresh water,

400
00:21:59.610 --> 00:22:03.450
all the Nan is few surviving pirates landed in the area known as the Darien

401
00:22:03.960 --> 00:22:07.650
is-ness. This was one of the most hospitable areas of jungle in the world.

402
00:22:07.680 --> 00:22:10.020
Even today considered to be almost impenetrable,

403
00:22:10.050 --> 00:22:11.850
surrounded by a hostile environments.

404
00:22:11.851 --> 00:22:14.700
The Buccaneers soon run a foul of local tribes,

405
00:22:14.730 --> 00:22:16.890
most likely belonging to the Kuna people.

406
00:22:17.040 --> 00:22:21.270
Some contemporary sources describe the Darian natives as inherently violent and

407
00:22:21.271 --> 00:22:22.400
cannibalistic. However,

408
00:22:22.410 --> 00:22:27.030
accounts of a latest Scottish expeditions of the Darwinian and 60 99 report,

409
00:22:27.150 --> 00:22:30.840
how the tribes were generally welcoming and especially sympathetic to the

410
00:22:30.841 --> 00:22:32.040
enemies of the Spanish.

411
00:22:32.100 --> 00:22:35.730
What we can realistically assume is that the Qunar knew about the reputation of

412
00:22:36.120 --> 00:22:38.250
Lala, Nan, as men for sadistic conquest,

413
00:22:38.370 --> 00:22:42.150
or perhaps they were simply defending themselves against invaders. In any case,

414
00:22:42.151 --> 00:22:45.960
the CUNA soon brief to be more than a match for the pirates gruesome violence.

415
00:22:46.140 --> 00:22:48.000
After a series of attacks on the course,

416
00:22:48.001 --> 00:22:51.450
as the natives captured the few survivors, including the man from Alon,

417
00:22:51.510 --> 00:22:55.140
one of the Buccaneers survived captivity with the Qunar and was later able to

418
00:22:55.440 --> 00:22:58.440
bow witness on the fate of Francois, Lola NAPE,

419
00:22:58.620 --> 00:23:00.450
the locals torn in pieces,

420
00:23:00.600 --> 00:23:04.320
throwing his body limb by limb into the fire and disasters into the,

421
00:23:04.321 --> 00:23:08.970
as it's no trace or memory might remain of such an infamous inhuman

422
00:23:08.971 --> 00:23:11.550
creature and infamous inhuman creature.

423
00:23:11.551 --> 00:23:15.750
Indeed [inaudible] had gone down in history as the most bloodthirsty of the

424
00:23:16.060 --> 00:23:19.590
course says of taught Douga. And probably even if the whole Caribbean,

425
00:23:19.740 --> 00:23:22.830
even though the term is not often associated with pirates,

426
00:23:22.831 --> 00:23:26.490
the man may have been a psychopathic killer, a man,

427
00:23:26.491 --> 00:23:30.870
completely devoid of empathy who personally killed at least a hundred people.

428
00:23:31.080 --> 00:23:34.380
Before we end today, I throw the gauntlet of the challenge over to you.

429
00:23:34.620 --> 00:23:37.980
What pirate in history could possibly rival France while all the knee and

430
00:23:37.981 --> 00:23:39.210
savagery and cruelty.
