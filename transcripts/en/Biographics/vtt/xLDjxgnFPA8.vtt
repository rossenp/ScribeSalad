00:00:00.050 --> 00:00:02.360
<v 0>April the fourth, 1968 at 6:00 PM.</v>

2
00:00:02.361 --> 00:00:05.800
The minister stood on the balcony of the Lorraine motel in Memphis.

3
00:00:06.360 --> 00:00:10.000
He was only 39 yet. He had accumulated many decades worth of struggles,

4
00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:11.840
triumphs and setbacks.

5
00:00:12.020 --> 00:00:15.640
The civil rights leader had spurred landmark victories against segregation and

6
00:00:15.641 --> 00:00:17.520
racial discrimination in the United States.

7
00:00:17.650 --> 00:00:21.350
There was so much more for him to accomplish, but at 6:01 PM,

8
00:00:21.790 --> 00:00:24.750
a snapping sound cracked loud in the Memphis sky.

9
00:00:24.990 --> 00:00:29.390
A bullet flew across the road and Martin Luther king Jr. Fell to the ground,

10
00:00:29.790 --> 00:00:30.830
bleeding from his head and neck

11
00:00:43.080 --> 00:00:46.420
Almost four decades before the rifle was fired. Martin Luther king Jr.

12
00:00:46.560 --> 00:00:50.540
Was born on January the 15th, 1929 in Atlanta, Georgia.

13
00:00:50.920 --> 00:00:52.260
The seconds of three siblings,

14
00:00:52.261 --> 00:00:54.860
he looked on in admiration at his minister father,

15
00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:56.500
as he fought racial segregation,

16
00:00:56.550 --> 00:00:59.780
still rifle and Southern states king senior was a member of the national

17
00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:02.970
association for the advancement of, of people or N NA AAC,

18
00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:07.050
P and did won a campaign on equal pay for white and black teachers in America.

19
00:01:07.270 --> 00:01:08.091
By his late teens,

20
00:01:08.091 --> 00:01:11.330
Martin had decided that social action was his true calling and the religion

21
00:01:11.500 --> 00:01:13.250
would be the means to that end.

22
00:01:13.510 --> 00:01:17.250
<v 6>His decision had been influenced by his father, but also by the essay,</v>

23
00:01:17.251 --> 00:01:19.610
civil disobedience by Henry David Thoreau.

24
00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:23.680
Its basic principle is that a citizens first of obligation is to do what they

25
00:01:23.681 --> 00:01:28.240
believe is right and not to follow the laws dictated by a majority or an unjust

26
00:01:28.241 --> 00:01:28.900
government.

27
00:01:28.900 --> 00:01:32.600
<v 0>So in September of 1948, Martin enrolled at Crowser seminary,</v>

28
00:01:32.620 --> 00:01:35.560
he excelled there becoming the first African American student body president.

29
00:01:35.780 --> 00:01:38.520
He read voraciously on theology and philosophy of nowhere.

30
00:01:38.760 --> 00:01:39.960
His studies on Walter Chen,

31
00:01:40.160 --> 00:01:43.190
Bush and his notion of a church responsible for social justice,

32
00:01:43.570 --> 00:01:45.950
but especially on Karl marks,

33
00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:49.430
king appreciated marks' critique of unbridled capitalism,

34
00:01:49.570 --> 00:01:54.470
but he never embraced communism due to its atheistic views. In 1951 king Jr.

35
00:01:54.580 --> 00:01:58.270
Graduated from Crozier and continued his education at Boston university while

36
00:01:58.271 --> 00:02:01.350
pursuing a PhD. He conducted with equal determination,

37
00:02:01.410 --> 00:02:05.820
the courtship of a young students at the new England conservatory, miss Carta,

38
00:02:05.821 --> 00:02:06.280
Scott,

39
00:02:06.280 --> 00:02:09.420
he won over her initial reluctance about dating a minister and the two were

40
00:02:09.421 --> 00:02:11.460
married on the 18th of June, 1953.

41
00:02:17.860 --> 00:02:17.861
Dr.

42
00:02:17.861 --> 00:02:22.260
King was soon offered a post as minister at the Dexter avenue Baptist church in

43
00:02:22.261 --> 00:02:25.530
Montgomery, Alabama on December the first 1955, uh,

44
00:02:25.850 --> 00:02:29.330
black seamstres refused to give up her seat to a white passenger on one of

45
00:02:29.331 --> 00:02:32.850
Montgomery's segregated buses. Her name was Rosa parks.

46
00:02:32.851 --> 00:02:36.370
Since we've actually done a biographics video all about her before.

47
00:02:36.390 --> 00:02:38.890
So check it out after this one, if you fancy it,

48
00:02:38.950 --> 00:02:43.130
the white bus driver had Mrs. Parks arrested prompting the reaction of the NAACP

49
00:02:43.310 --> 00:02:44.960
and the women's, his political council.

50
00:02:45.070 --> 00:02:49.200
They organized a boycot of Montgomery bus services supported by nearly 20,000

51
00:02:49.201 --> 00:02:52.800
African American citizens king initially offered nothing more than the basement

52
00:02:52.860 --> 00:02:55.040
of his church as a meeting place for the activists,

53
00:02:55.140 --> 00:02:58.680
but eventually he was offered the chance to lead their group a chance,

54
00:02:58.930 --> 00:03:02.600
which he accepted king and ARD fan of Martin. Ganzi stressed.

55
00:03:02.620 --> 00:03:04.520
The importance of nonviolent protest.

56
00:03:04.820 --> 00:03:08.520
The minister led the boycot for most of 1956 becoming the target of threats and

57
00:03:08.680 --> 00:03:10.360
violence by white citizens and the police.

58
00:03:10.540 --> 00:03:12.360
The protest ended on December the 21st,

59
00:03:12.600 --> 00:03:15.680
1956 when the Supreme court ruled that segregation on buses was

60
00:03:15.740 --> 00:03:16.600
unconstitutional.

61
00:03:16.660 --> 00:03:21.230
But attacks from the white community did not stop homes and churches were bombed

62
00:03:21.530 --> 00:03:24.470
or shot at Dr. King had scored an initial success,

63
00:03:24.570 --> 00:03:26.870
but a hard struggle still lay ahead.

64
00:03:33.210 --> 00:03:37.070
In January of 1957 king and other leaders of the boycot gathered in Atlanta,

65
00:03:37.071 --> 00:03:37.570
Georgia,

66
00:03:37.570 --> 00:03:42.340
and found that the Southern Christie and leadership conference or CLC with the

67
00:03:42.480 --> 00:03:44.700
aim of coordinating civil rights protests,

68
00:03:44.730 --> 00:03:48.020
king became president and fundraiser of the conference traveling across the

69
00:03:48.021 --> 00:03:52.940
nation and attracting crowds with his charisma and natural Ary skills in one of

70
00:03:52.941 --> 00:03:54.220
his first recorded speeches,

71
00:03:54.221 --> 00:03:58.180
king outlined his concept of love as a force for change to fight an unjust

72
00:03:58.740 --> 00:04:03.130
system saying love is not merely an emotional something love is the refusal to

73
00:04:03.131 --> 00:04:06.490
defeat any individual. You seek only to defeat evil systems,

74
00:04:06.760 --> 00:04:09.450
individuals who happen to be caught up in that system.

75
00:04:09.670 --> 00:04:12.410
You love that you seek to defeat the system.

76
00:04:12.600 --> 00:04:16.210
King was encouraged and supported by a trio of advisors with hard left

77
00:04:16.211 --> 00:04:19.690
inclinations. They are thrusted in an activist with communist sympathies.

78
00:04:19.970 --> 00:04:22.480
So socialist Ella baker and Stanley Levison,

79
00:04:22.560 --> 00:04:25.880
a former leading member of the us communist party in February,

80
00:04:25.880 --> 00:04:29.480
1957 king and his advisor sent a message to president Eisenhower requesting that

81
00:04:29.481 --> 00:04:32.560
he shared a conference on civil rights. I ignored the letter,

82
00:04:32.740 --> 00:04:37.640
but time magazine didn't and they featured Dr. King on its cover in may

83
00:04:37.641 --> 00:04:41.470
king spoke to almost 40,000 people at the Lincoln Memorial in Washington, DC.

84
00:04:41.840 --> 00:04:42.671
Later in the year,

85
00:04:42.671 --> 00:04:46.430
he launched the crusade for citizenship program to register 2 million black

86
00:04:46.431 --> 00:04:48.910
voters in time for the 1960 presidential election.

87
00:04:49.050 --> 00:04:51.990
His caucus was growing mightily in 1958.

88
00:04:52.090 --> 00:04:54.150
The reverends published stride toward freedom.

89
00:04:54.370 --> 00:04:57.630
His accounts of the Montgomery bus boycots the book sold well in.

90
00:04:58.030 --> 00:04:59.550
He attended many books, signing events,

91
00:04:59.750 --> 00:05:03.100
a one of them in Harlem in September the 20th, 1958, Dr.

92
00:05:03.101 --> 00:05:07.300
King was stabbed by Iola Curry later diagnosed with paranoid schizophrenia.

93
00:05:07.400 --> 00:05:09.300
The attacker used a letter opener,

94
00:05:09.301 --> 00:05:11.100
which slid very close to the minister's heart.

95
00:05:11.240 --> 00:05:14.700
One of his lungs as he later recalls. And he sneezed in that moment.

96
00:05:15.040 --> 00:05:16.100
He would've surely died.

97
00:05:16.290 --> 00:05:19.700
Luckily surgeons at Harlem hospital were able to remove the blade without

98
00:05:19.701 --> 00:05:20.580
causing further damage.

99
00:05:21.060 --> 00:05:24.610
While con thinking took the occasion to travel to India in February 9 59,

100
00:05:24.700 --> 00:05:28.170
where he deepened his knowledge of nonviolent protest at the Gandhi peace

101
00:05:28.171 --> 00:05:32.330
foundation upon returning king had occasion to test these tactics

102
00:05:38.510 --> 00:05:39.810
In April of 1959,

103
00:05:39.811 --> 00:05:43.680
African American college students in North Carolina in a staged peaceful sit-ins

104
00:05:43.700 --> 00:05:45.880
in di to protest segregation.

105
00:05:46.140 --> 00:05:49.960
The S SCLC had become involved with Ella baker who organized the student

106
00:05:50.050 --> 00:05:55.040
nonviolent coordinating committee or SNCC in rally, North Carolina.

107
00:05:55.230 --> 00:05:59.160
When the protest spread to Georgia king participated in a sit-in in an Atlanta

108
00:05:59.161 --> 00:06:01.120
department store and was briefly jailed.

109
00:06:01.121 --> 00:06:04.440
Luckily he was released early from prison, thanks to presidential candidate,

110
00:06:04.441 --> 00:06:07.280
John F. Kennedy Kennedy sympathized with the civil rights movement,

111
00:06:07.300 --> 00:06:10.280
but was also trying to appeal to white, moderate southerners,

112
00:06:10.340 --> 00:06:12.720
misled the SMCC to distrust king.

113
00:06:12.780 --> 00:06:15.760
If he could appeal to Kennedy and his white moderates,

114
00:06:15.761 --> 00:06:18.950
how could he be the best representative for them?

115
00:06:19.050 --> 00:06:22.110
King's devotions of the civil rights causes would be questioned again in the

116
00:06:22.111 --> 00:06:24.870
summer of 1961, the organization called core,

117
00:06:24.930 --> 00:06:28.790
the Congress of racial equality had organized a series of freedom rides or

118
00:06:28.791 --> 00:06:31.830
interstate bus trips intended to desegregate stations.

119
00:06:31.940 --> 00:06:35.470
King helped core by training freedom riders in the methods of nonviolent

120
00:06:35.471 --> 00:06:38.940
protests. But when they were met with violence, by why counter protestors,

121
00:06:39.040 --> 00:06:42.340
the minister questioned whether the campaign was worth all this pain King's

122
00:06:42.780 --> 00:06:46.100
reticence attracted more suspicion and criticism King's involvements. However,

123
00:06:46.320 --> 00:06:49.740
was supremely beneficial to the cause through his dialogue with attorney

124
00:06:49.741 --> 00:06:52.540
general, Robert Kennedy, the brought the federal government to his site.

125
00:06:52.541 --> 00:06:56.340
Robert Kennedy ensured federal agencies intervened to protect core protestors

126
00:06:56.400 --> 00:07:00.890
and ordered a on segregation in interstate travel in December,

127
00:07:00.890 --> 00:07:03.850
1961 king joined another existing action. The Albany movement in Georgia,

128
00:07:04.000 --> 00:07:06.730
this was another campaign of sit-ins led by the SNCC.

129
00:07:07.410 --> 00:07:11.290
Often many of its members had been incarcerated king decided to step in Ian's

130
00:07:11.650 --> 00:07:13.690
activists. Ralph Anahi were also jailed,

131
00:07:13.710 --> 00:07:17.450
but they kept campaigning until July, 1962. Meanwhile,

132
00:07:17.451 --> 00:07:21.360
young pro protesters creep hard and frustrated until violence broke out a crowd

133
00:07:21.560 --> 00:07:23.600
of 2000 confronted the police despite king,

134
00:07:23.601 --> 00:07:25.600
trying to maintain peace with a prayer vigil.

135
00:07:25.600 --> 00:07:28.240
City authorities eventually obtained a federal injunction,

136
00:07:28.250 --> 00:07:32.840
which banned king and the SNCC from staging any type of protest until then king

137
00:07:32.960 --> 00:07:35.200
at Fort local authorities with the help of the federal government.

138
00:07:35.500 --> 00:07:39.310
Now that the federal government was being used against him or his chances,

139
00:07:39.580 --> 00:07:42.950
even Bobby Kennedy advised him not to try his luck against the injunction.

140
00:07:43.090 --> 00:07:46.150
Martin Luther king left Albany in August. It had been in defeat,

141
00:07:46.170 --> 00:07:49.830
but he would learn from his mistakes for his next campaign in Birmingham,

142
00:07:50.100 --> 00:07:50.933
Alabama

143
00:07:56.930 --> 00:07:58.030
in Birmingham, the state governor,

144
00:07:58.090 --> 00:08:02.460
the city mayor and for police were all known segregationist between 1957 and

145
00:08:02.620 --> 00:08:06.540
19 62 17 bombings had taken place against the black households and churches.

146
00:08:06.960 --> 00:08:09.460
One of them was the church belonging to SCLC member,

147
00:08:09.860 --> 00:08:12.860
Reverend Shuttleworth who invited king to take action in Birmingham.

148
00:08:12.880 --> 00:08:17.180
His campaign started on April the third 90 63 with lunch counter sit-ins that

149
00:08:17.181 --> 00:08:19.340
were followed by March on city hall. Again,

150
00:08:19.500 --> 00:08:22.850
not on violent protests were followed by mass arrests and an injunction against

151
00:08:22.870 --> 00:08:26.810
the SCLC campaigns. But now the injunction came from a state court,

152
00:08:26.910 --> 00:08:27.743
not a federal one,

153
00:08:27.870 --> 00:08:32.690
and king have no qualms in violating state law king and Ralph Ana bled

154
00:08:32.691 --> 00:08:35.330
another rally on April the 12th. The police cracked down,

155
00:08:35.331 --> 00:08:38.370
which eventually led to the two leaders being placed in solitary confinement.

156
00:08:38.420 --> 00:08:41.840
While in prison king wrote his famous us letter from a Birmingham jail,

157
00:08:41.841 --> 00:08:45.680
which became something of a manifesto for his movement in its equal for

158
00:08:45.681 --> 00:08:47.360
Christians to become a force for change.

159
00:08:47.430 --> 00:08:51.160
Even at the price of being treated as agitators or disturbers of the peace,

160
00:08:51.380 --> 00:08:54.120
the church was not supposed to fit into the society around it,

161
00:08:54.140 --> 00:08:58.480
but to transform it by standing against injustice. In the meantime, Dr.

162
00:08:58.481 --> 00:09:00.960
King's wife, Carretta had contacted the white house.

163
00:09:00.961 --> 00:09:04.480
Bobby Kennedy stepped in sending FBI agents to Birmingham to ensure better

164
00:09:04.481 --> 00:09:05.520
treatment for the minister.

165
00:09:05.520 --> 00:09:08.040
He was soon released from jail and more marches followed,

166
00:09:08.041 --> 00:09:10.520
met by increasingly violent actions by the police chief,

167
00:09:10.521 --> 00:09:12.960
who resorted to far hoses and attacked dogs.

168
00:09:13.100 --> 00:09:16.550
The televised images of the BI and rights struck a chord with the conscience of

169
00:09:16.551 --> 00:09:19.190
the nation. It was a turning point for the civil rights movement,

170
00:09:19.191 --> 00:09:22.430
which prompted thousands of citizens to express their outrage to the white

171
00:09:22.431 --> 00:09:24.310
house. It became evident that the Kennedys,

172
00:09:24.311 --> 00:09:27.790
that it was time to tackle racial issues more seriously with the tide of the

173
00:09:27.791 --> 00:09:28.870
nation, turning against them.

174
00:09:28.871 --> 00:09:32.790
Birmingham city hall signaled its willingness to negotiate a desegregation

175
00:09:33.070 --> 00:09:34.270
program. It was a great victory.

176
00:09:34.470 --> 00:09:38.540
The Dr. King albeit a bitter one and a common pattern concessions to African

177
00:09:39.100 --> 00:09:42.780
Americans were followed by violence from white citizens who were messed with

178
00:09:42.970 --> 00:09:46.340
retaliation from the black community, true to his principles.

179
00:09:46.341 --> 00:09:49.700
King patrolled the streets of burning and preaching African Americans to answer

180
00:09:49.980 --> 00:09:51.300
violence only with peace.

181
00:09:57.890 --> 00:10:01.130
A natural follow up to Birmingham was the organization of a nationwide event.

182
00:10:01.270 --> 00:10:05.050
The March on Washington for jobs and freedom would take place in August the

183
00:10:05.051 --> 00:10:09.410
28th, 1963 tens of thousands of people would March the Lincoln Memorial,

184
00:10:09.460 --> 00:10:12.770
where they would listen to speeches by Dr. King and other Raiders.

185
00:10:12.910 --> 00:10:15.970
The planning of the event proved controversial from the start, the Ken,

186
00:10:16.040 --> 00:10:19.640
the administration supportive of king strife that agreed to submit a civil

187
00:10:19.641 --> 00:10:22.080
rights bill before Congress, a landmark moment.

188
00:10:22.440 --> 00:10:26.840
And yet both JFK and Bobby feared that if the March degenerated into writing

189
00:10:27.480 --> 00:10:28.760
Congress could reject the bill.

190
00:10:28.940 --> 00:10:31.240
So the administration participated in the planning,

191
00:10:31.241 --> 00:10:34.800
editing speeches and including white organizations in the roster of

192
00:10:34.801 --> 00:10:37.550
participants. This move in leaders,

193
00:10:37.830 --> 00:10:40.430
such as Malcolm X from the nation of Islam who questions,

194
00:10:40.431 --> 00:10:41.790
the authenticity of the March,

195
00:10:42.010 --> 00:10:45.630
the March organizes themselves were worried that the S SCLC had appointed bay

196
00:10:46.310 --> 00:10:47.670
Rustin as chief planner. In fact,

197
00:10:47.730 --> 00:10:52.310
the FBI held a big dossier on him as a known communist to draft Dodger and

198
00:10:52.510 --> 00:10:53.130
homosexual.

199
00:10:53.130 --> 00:10:56.630
But despite internal concerns that March for jobs and freedom was a success

200
00:10:57.060 --> 00:11:00.340
attendance exceeded expectations and a crowd of 250,000.

201
00:11:00.341 --> 00:11:02.940
Listen to Martin Luther king Jr's most famous speech.

202
00:11:03.420 --> 00:11:04.253
<v 5>I have a dream.</v>

203
00:11:08.120 --> 00:11:09.500
My poor little children

204
00:11:11.660 --> 00:11:15.580
will one day live in a nation where they will not be judged by the color of

205
00:11:15.780 --> 00:11:18.330
their skin, but by the content of their a character.

206
00:11:18.890 --> 00:11:22.850
I have a dream that one day, every valley shall be ex exhausted.

207
00:11:23.740 --> 00:11:25.770
Every hill in mounting shall be made.

208
00:11:26.090 --> 00:11:30.290
All the rough places will be made plain and the crook places will be made.

209
00:11:30.570 --> 00:11:34.770
<v 0>Straight. And he warns about not turning that dream into a nightmare of hatred.</v>

210
00:11:35.550 --> 00:11:40.040
<v 5>We must forever conduct our struggle on that high plain of dignity and</v>

211
00:11:40.041 --> 00:11:40.874
discipline.

212
00:11:41.740 --> 00:11:46.280
We must not allow our creative protests to degenerate

213
00:11:46.630 --> 00:11:49.560
into physical violence again, and a gain.

214
00:11:50.940 --> 00:11:55.760
We must rise to the majestic Heights of meeting physical force

215
00:11:56.080 --> 00:11:56.800
with soul.

216
00:11:56.800 --> 00:12:00.520
<v 0>Force king, and the S CRC had gone from strength to strength,</v>

217
00:12:00.580 --> 00:12:04.000
but their victories would be soured by the opposition of one of the most

218
00:12:04.240 --> 00:12:07.960
powerful men in America, FBI director, Jay Edgar, Hoover,

219
00:12:14.450 --> 00:12:17.950
The director of the FBI had long feared that the civil rights movement may be

220
00:12:17.951 --> 00:12:21.550
infiltrated by communism. The bureau had a dossier about Rustin,

221
00:12:21.551 --> 00:12:24.350
but their chief Warry came from lawyers, Stanley Levison.

222
00:12:24.351 --> 00:12:27.230
One of King's top advisors since the mid 1950s,

223
00:12:27.231 --> 00:12:30.230
the FBI kept tabs on Levison bys network of informants,

224
00:12:30.231 --> 00:12:34.060
including two members of the communist party named and Morris Charles,

225
00:12:34.440 --> 00:12:38.020
the Charles reported that Levison had been a top financer for the party until

226
00:12:38.021 --> 00:12:42.820
early 1957, before growing disillusioned with communism. Then in January, 1962,

227
00:12:43.220 --> 00:12:43.221
JAG,

228
00:12:43.221 --> 00:12:46.700
Charles learns that Levison had been writing speeches for Dr. King days later.

229
00:12:46.701 --> 00:12:50.100
Bobby Kennedy received notice from Hoover Levison was a member of the communist

230
00:12:50.110 --> 00:12:55.050
party USA and was allegedly a close advisor to Reverend Martin Luther king,

231
00:12:55.290 --> 00:12:58.650
Jr. Robert Kennedy authorized the bugging of Leviton's office privately.

232
00:12:58.651 --> 00:13:01.250
He wanted king to sever ties with him all the while.

233
00:13:01.570 --> 00:13:03.770
Jay Edgar Hoover suspected that king was a communist too.

234
00:13:03.770 --> 00:13:06.610
And indeed king had been sounded out by the Soviets.

235
00:13:06.611 --> 00:13:09.290
According to disclosures by X KGB, archivist,

236
00:13:09.890 --> 00:13:13.210
vastly mid Mosco had taken an interest in infiltrating the civil rights

237
00:13:13.211 --> 00:13:13.590
movements,

238
00:13:13.590 --> 00:13:17.880
but had found that king was too pro-American and anti communit to consider any

239
00:13:17.881 --> 00:13:19.400
sort of relationship with the Soviets.

240
00:13:19.401 --> 00:13:23.320
Subsequently the KGB launched a disinformation campaign in African newspapers

241
00:13:23.510 --> 00:13:25.600
depicting king as a government porn,

242
00:13:25.730 --> 00:13:30.120
regardless Hoover's suspicion grew into personal dislike until late 1962,

243
00:13:30.230 --> 00:13:33.920
when king criticized the bureaus investigation of racial crimes in Albany,

244
00:13:34.550 --> 00:13:36.230
according to a department of justice report,

245
00:13:36.231 --> 00:13:39.470
this is when the flames of director Hoover's antipathy for Dr.

246
00:13:39.500 --> 00:13:41.750
King were fans into open hostility.

247
00:13:41.930 --> 00:13:45.710
We believe the persistent controversy between Dr. King and director Hoover was a

248
00:13:45.711 --> 00:13:48.870
major factor in the Bureau's determination to discredit Dr.

249
00:13:48.871 --> 00:13:51.110
King and destroy his leadership role.

250
00:13:51.300 --> 00:13:54.750
This hostility may explain what happened in March of 1963,

251
00:13:54.950 --> 00:13:58.580
Jack child's informed the FBI that Levison and severed all ties with the party,

252
00:13:58.800 --> 00:14:02.660
but Hoover failed to notify the attorney general. So in June of 1963,

253
00:14:02.661 --> 00:14:05.060
Bobby Kennedy increased his pressure on king.

254
00:14:05.320 --> 00:14:09.140
The minister had to get rid of Levison king reluctantly agreed,

255
00:14:09.160 --> 00:14:13.260
but he and Levison remained in touch using attorney Clarence B Jones as a

256
00:14:13.261 --> 00:14:15.500
telephonic intermediary. The FBI picked up on the,

257
00:14:15.570 --> 00:14:20.290
the reason and why tap Jones Simon office in August of 1963 king stayed at

258
00:14:20.291 --> 00:14:24.410
Jones' place and Hoover's bugs recorded something unexpected proof of an extra

259
00:14:24.411 --> 00:14:28.410
marital affair that king was involved in. Then in October of 1963,

260
00:14:28.411 --> 00:14:31.890
Robert Kennedy extended permission to conduct technical surveillance on king.

261
00:14:32.030 --> 00:14:35.530
The investigation was led by FBI assistant director, William C. Sullivan,

262
00:14:35.790 --> 00:14:39.480
who focused on documenting the minister's private activities and sex life.

263
00:14:39.540 --> 00:14:43.920
But Sullivan did not just record King's encounters on tape in 1975,

264
00:14:44.100 --> 00:14:47.440
FBI supervisors, Seymour Fred Phillips testified before the us Senate,

265
00:14:47.470 --> 00:14:50.920
that Sullivan had used one of these tapes to black. Now, Reverend king,

266
00:14:51.000 --> 00:14:53.800
he had sent him a copy of a recording alongside an anonymous letter,

267
00:14:54.160 --> 00:14:56.560
threatening to expose the truth to Carretta and the public,

268
00:14:56.740 --> 00:15:00.880
the message included availed invitation for the minister to commit suicide less.

269
00:15:00.940 --> 00:15:03.320
The information be leaked. King ignored. The threats,

270
00:15:03.321 --> 00:15:05.720
obviously in the FBI did not go public with the scandal,

271
00:15:05.980 --> 00:15:10.750
but the who the king feud continued throughout 1964 king accused Hoover of a

272
00:15:10.751 --> 00:15:12.150
betting racist, right?

273
00:15:12.151 --> 00:15:15.910
Wingers Hoover retorted by calling him the most notorious liar in the country

274
00:15:16.370 --> 00:15:20.630
and a sexual degenerate FBI agents continued to monitor the civil rights leader,

275
00:15:20.730 --> 00:15:23.190
but most surveillance was dropped in 1965.

276
00:15:23.500 --> 00:15:26.150
This is when the Kings moved into a new house in Atlanta,

277
00:15:26.590 --> 00:15:27.990
apparently for administrative reasons,

278
00:15:27.991 --> 00:15:30.670
Hoover wanted to cut down on his astronomical number of wire.

279
00:15:31.040 --> 00:15:34.460
So he did not authorize the bugging of King's new place.

280
00:15:34.600 --> 00:15:37.500
The FBI tapes will be fully disclosed in 2027,

281
00:15:37.600 --> 00:15:41.060
but some of the transcripts and surveillance notes were declassified in June of

282
00:15:42.060 --> 00:15:42.200
2019.

283
00:15:42.200 --> 00:15:45.980
The dossier reveals how king engaged in several extramarital affairs with fellow

284
00:15:45.981 --> 00:15:49.900
activists, parishioners and sex workers, FBI agents, even suspected.

285
00:15:49.900 --> 00:15:51.970
He may have fathered a child out of wedlock.

286
00:15:52.040 --> 00:15:55.610
Page 18 of the report contains a disturbing comment on January the fifth,

287
00:15:55.850 --> 00:15:59.970
1964 king and other SCLC officials checked into a hotel in Washington, DC.

288
00:16:00.310 --> 00:16:03.690
The group met in the room of a Baltimore minister and started discussing which

289
00:16:03.691 --> 00:16:08.330
of their parishioners would be suitable for natural and unnatural sex acts.

290
00:16:08.440 --> 00:16:10.850
When one of the women in the group protested her disapproval,

291
00:16:10.910 --> 00:16:12.880
the Baltimore minister immediately,

292
00:16:13.140 --> 00:16:17.120
and forcibly raped her a handwritten note possibly by Sullivan comments that

293
00:16:17.121 --> 00:16:21.920
king looked on laughed and offered advice. So could that be true?

294
00:16:22.210 --> 00:16:23.520
David J Garrow,

295
00:16:23.540 --> 00:16:26.480
the Pulitz surprise winning biographer of king was the first to review the

296
00:16:26.600 --> 00:16:29.440
documents in a lengthy essay commoning that we will know the full truth.

297
00:16:29.710 --> 00:16:31.720
Only when the actual tapes are revealed.

298
00:16:38.120 --> 00:16:39.550
Let's return to King's public life.

299
00:16:39.551 --> 00:16:42.510
As we have reached the pinnacle of his career in 1964,

300
00:16:42.511 --> 00:16:45.630
king offered his support to Lydon Johnson's electoral campaign.

301
00:16:45.631 --> 00:16:49.190
Following the assassination of JFK Johnson had vowed to support the civil rights

302
00:16:49.191 --> 00:16:50.030
bill and on July,

303
00:16:50.031 --> 00:16:53.620
the second Johnson invited king to the white house for a signing of the rights

304
00:16:53.621 --> 00:16:54.290
act into law.

305
00:16:54.290 --> 00:16:57.860
This was the crowning achievement of King's efforts in Montgomery and Birmingham

306
00:16:58.240 --> 00:16:58.461
law,

307
00:16:58.461 --> 00:17:02.340
which prohibited discrimination in public places provided for the integration of

308
00:17:02.341 --> 00:17:05.980
schools and other facilities and made workplace discrimination illegal.

309
00:17:06.160 --> 00:17:09.140
In October of that same year, the reverends received a phone call from Oslo,

310
00:17:09.820 --> 00:17:12.740
won the Nobel peace prize. He collected the award on December the 10th,

311
00:17:12.741 --> 00:17:16.050
donating the prize money to the civil rights movements shortly after his return.

312
00:17:16.290 --> 00:17:18.170
Another trial awaited him in Selma, Alabama.

313
00:17:18.280 --> 00:17:22.370
This is where the black population had been actively prevented from registering

314
00:17:22.371 --> 00:17:25.210
to vote by a segregationist mayor and police chief on February,

315
00:17:25.211 --> 00:17:25.891
the first king letter,

316
00:17:25.891 --> 00:17:29.690
March to the Selma courthouse to protest slow voter registration. Inevitably,

317
00:17:30.170 --> 00:17:33.410
it was jailed for five days. A second March took place on the 18th,

318
00:17:33.510 --> 00:17:35.640
but protest were attacked by a white mob.

319
00:17:36.000 --> 00:17:38.720
A young black man was shot and died of his wounds.

320
00:17:38.950 --> 00:17:41.400
King knew that he had to involve the president at this stage.

321
00:17:41.500 --> 00:17:42.520
So on March the fifth,

322
00:17:42.521 --> 00:17:45.600
he met with Johnson and encouraged him to introduce the voting rights bill.

323
00:17:45.601 --> 00:17:49.040
The aim was to outlaw stalling tactics and intimidation used to prevent African

324
00:17:49.640 --> 00:17:51.800
Americans from vote registering, but Johnson declined.

325
00:17:51.801 --> 00:17:53.400
So king unveiled his next plan,

326
00:17:53.640 --> 00:17:56.760
a massive March from Selma to Montgomery on March the seventh,

327
00:17:56.790 --> 00:18:00.280
more than 500 people began marching up the highway to Montgomery.

328
00:18:00.470 --> 00:18:02.200
When they reached the Edmund Pettus bridge,

329
00:18:02.201 --> 00:18:03.800
they were confronted by state police.

330
00:18:03.940 --> 00:18:07.080
At least 66 protestors were badly injured in the RS,

331
00:18:07.240 --> 00:18:11.310
but televised images of the battle inspired similar protests in major cities

332
00:18:11.311 --> 00:18:14.230
nationwide Johnson was now paying full attention to this struggle.

333
00:18:14.300 --> 00:18:18.230
King made his next move. Second and March of March again,

334
00:18:18.380 --> 00:18:21.030
demonstrators met with police on the Edmund pats bridge,

335
00:18:21.210 --> 00:18:23.710
but this time king ordered the March to disperse.

336
00:18:23.940 --> 00:18:27.590
Despite the protests of fellow activists that night back in Selma,

337
00:18:27.830 --> 00:18:30.300
a white minister from Boston had participated in the March,

338
00:18:30.560 --> 00:18:32.220
was murdered by Klansman.

339
00:18:32.320 --> 00:18:35.980
The Selma case exploded and thousands of religious leaders picketed the white

340
00:18:35.981 --> 00:18:36.221
house.

341
00:18:36.221 --> 00:18:39.980
President Johnson was now convinced that he needed to support Martin Luther

342
00:18:40.010 --> 00:18:42.220
king. In this struggle on March the 24th,

343
00:18:42.221 --> 00:18:45.540
he ordered 4,000 troops to escort a third and successful March.

344
00:18:46.540 --> 00:18:51.330
Omey another big victory for king and the S SCLC soured again by another

345
00:18:51.331 --> 00:18:54.490
killing. A white activist was shot later that night. Nonetheless,

346
00:18:54.510 --> 00:18:57.570
the events of Selma prompted Johnson to draft the voting rights bill,

347
00:18:57.571 --> 00:19:01.050
which was signed into law on August the sixth, 1965,

348
00:19:07.360 --> 00:19:08.210
Just six days later,

349
00:19:08.320 --> 00:19:12.680
king first spoke against at an SCLC convention king

350
00:19:12.880 --> 00:19:16.280
demanded that the government ended its intervention in Vietnam and even offered

351
00:19:16.281 --> 00:19:19.840
to lead peace negotiations with the north Vietnamese leader. HoChi men.

352
00:19:20.160 --> 00:19:22.760
They are thrusted and discouraged him from tackling the issue.

353
00:19:22.960 --> 00:19:25.720
As the civil rights movement could not afford to alienate Johnson's support.

354
00:19:25.721 --> 00:19:26.281
Moreover,

355
00:19:26.281 --> 00:19:29.960
they could not disperse their energies into further causes or movements for the

356
00:19:30.080 --> 00:19:31.230
moments king agreed.

357
00:19:31.450 --> 00:19:34.910
His next campaign of note would focus on improving economic conditions for black

358
00:19:34.911 --> 00:19:36.310
communities in Northern cities.

359
00:19:36.450 --> 00:19:39.590
He organized the freedom Sunday in Chicago on July the 10th,

360
00:19:39.870 --> 00:19:43.510
1966 and 45,000 people joined the peaceful events,

361
00:19:43.710 --> 00:19:47.350
but rods broke out in Chicago's west side between black youth and the national

362
00:19:47.360 --> 00:19:48.010
guard.

363
00:19:48.010 --> 00:19:52.260
All in all the experience did not yield the reforms that king had hoped for.

364
00:19:52.280 --> 00:19:55.940
It appears that the more militant activists were rejecting his nonviolent

365
00:19:56.010 --> 00:19:57.060
tactics. One of them,

366
00:19:57.080 --> 00:20:01.500
the head of the SNCC Stokley Carmichael parted ways with king and

367
00:20:01.510 --> 00:20:05.420
co-founded the black Panther party in November of 1966 king resumed his

368
00:20:05.421 --> 00:20:07.220
criticism of the war. He testified to the Senate,

369
00:20:07.240 --> 00:20:10.980
the military spending was taking precedence over the budget designs to improve

370
00:20:10.981 --> 00:20:13.770
the living conditions of urban black communities. The.

371
00:20:13.940 --> 00:20:16.890
<v 5>Bombs in Vietnam exploded home.</v>

372
00:20:17.520 --> 00:20:22.490
They destroyed the dream and possibility for a decent America.

373
00:20:23.150 --> 00:20:24.170
<v 0>On February the 25th,</v>

374
00:20:24.370 --> 00:20:27.970
1967 king delivered his first public speech against the war followed by an

375
00:20:27.971 --> 00:20:31.530
anti-war demonstration in March. Then in April of 1967,

376
00:20:31.710 --> 00:20:35.560
his each beyond Vietnam made the news, but not in a positive way.

377
00:20:35.880 --> 00:20:39.880
King expressed his sympathies for the Vietnam and called for us forces to leave

378
00:20:39.881 --> 00:20:44.440
Vietnam life magazine objected that the speech sounded like Vietnam propaganda,

379
00:20:44.441 --> 00:20:48.160
and the Reverend was attacked by other civil rights groups. More importantly,

380
00:20:48.220 --> 00:20:52.440
the speech angered president Johnson and revived the FBI's efforts against king.

381
00:20:52.540 --> 00:20:56.360
The bureau disseminated articles criticizing the reverends and even hindered the

382
00:20:56.840 --> 00:20:58.080
SCL C fundraising efforts.

383
00:20:58.150 --> 00:21:02.240
King realized that he could not play a decisive role in the PAs movement and

384
00:21:02.241 --> 00:21:06.200
that the domestic issues revolving around racism and poverty had to remain his

385
00:21:06.201 --> 00:21:11.030
primary focus late in 1967 king announced his plans for a poor people's March

386
00:21:11.050 --> 00:21:13.910
on Washington on April the 22nd, 1968.

387
00:21:14.010 --> 00:21:18.350
It was conceived as a huge rally of the poor with no racial limitations intended

388
00:21:18.450 --> 00:21:21.910
to shut down the capital into a proper reforms were made,

389
00:21:22.390 --> 00:21:25.030
but Martin Luther king Jr. Had never lived to see it

390
00:21:31.440 --> 00:21:32.700
In March of 1968.

391
00:21:32.820 --> 00:21:35.860
Reverends king joined a strike of black sanitation workers in Memphis,

392
00:21:36.180 --> 00:21:40.220
Tennessee who demanded equal pay king joins a first March on the 28th,

393
00:21:40.221 --> 00:21:43.660
which soon turned violent, not approving of these methods. King left Memphis,

394
00:21:43.800 --> 00:21:45.700
but returned a few days later on April.

395
00:21:45.900 --> 00:21:48.250
The third on that night king delivered his lost speech.

396
00:21:48.480 --> 00:21:49.530
I've been to the mountain top.

397
00:21:50.520 --> 00:21:55.210
<v 5>Like anybody. I would like to live a long life,</v>

398
00:21:55.470 --> 00:21:57.610
but I'm not concerned about that. Now

399
00:21:59.410 --> 00:22:03.210
I just wanna do God's will. And I've seen

400
00:22:04.790 --> 00:22:09.000
the promise land. I may get there with you,

401
00:22:10.240 --> 00:22:13.480
but I want you to know the night that we,

402
00:22:13.580 --> 00:22:16.560
as a people will get to the promise land.

403
00:22:18.040 --> 00:22:19.640
<v 0>I may not get there. He said,</v>

404
00:22:19.980 --> 00:22:23.960
and unfortunately this line rang nearly prescient as the following afternoon,

405
00:22:23.961 --> 00:22:27.120
the bullet of an assassin ended Martin Luther king Jr's life.

406
00:22:27.220 --> 00:22:31.710
The shooter was a man named James Earl Ray following the shooting riots are

407
00:22:31.950 --> 00:22:32.770
wrapped across the states,

408
00:22:32.770 --> 00:22:35.270
but the death of king also had the effect of coalescing,

409
00:22:35.390 --> 00:22:37.750
his supporters into peaceful and meaningful protest.

410
00:22:38.090 --> 00:22:41.590
The Memphis strike and the poor people's March on Washington were a success

411
00:22:41.810 --> 00:22:45.950
during his lifetime reverends king had his critics both within and outside the

412
00:22:45.951 --> 00:22:46.784
civil rights movement.

413
00:22:46.810 --> 00:22:50.460
The Millers in factions dismissed his nonviolent tactics and criticized his

414
00:22:50.560 --> 00:22:54.340
appeal to moderate whites while law enforcement opposed him and sought to

415
00:22:54.341 --> 00:22:56.500
discredit him. And in the not too distant future,

416
00:22:56.710 --> 00:23:00.220
we'll find out the definitive truth about his private life and his misdeeds,

417
00:23:00.360 --> 00:23:03.460
but no one can deny the long lasting effects of his major legacy.

418
00:23:03.760 --> 00:23:08.580
The culmination of the civil rights and voting rights acts more than any other

419
00:23:08.581 --> 00:23:10.650
leader of his time. King dead dream.

420
00:23:10.720 --> 00:23:13.410
Even today's life's work may yet remain incomplete,

421
00:23:13.590 --> 00:23:17.370
but for the betterment of all his dreams have taken a concrete shape.

422
00:23:19.510 --> 00:23:21.970
