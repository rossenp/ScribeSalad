00:00:00.180 --> 00:00:01.710
<v 0>In the early days of the 1980s,</v>

2
00:00:01.830 --> 00:00:04.680
an unknown stalker was doing the rounds in the U S praying,

3
00:00:04.681 --> 00:00:08.070
mainly on young homosexual men, one after the other,

4
00:00:08.100 --> 00:00:12.210
they fell victim to illnesses considered to be quite rare until that time

5
00:00:12.270 --> 00:00:16.020
patterns bands were merged leading to the discovery of a new infection leading

6
00:00:16.021 --> 00:00:20.280
to the syndrome that would be dubbed the plague of the 21st century,

7
00:00:20.490 --> 00:00:21.750
but plague that would carry with it.

8
00:00:21.751 --> 00:00:25.800
The stigma of behaviors considered by some to be morally reprehensible

9
00:00:26.370 --> 00:00:28.140
HIV. In today's episode,

10
00:00:28.141 --> 00:00:32.250
we will trace the origins of the disease from the first publicized cases in the

11
00:00:32.251 --> 00:00:36.300
U S to the later research pointing to the first outbreaks across the Atlantic.

12
00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:41.310
Along the way we will discover the truth behind the man still known as patient

13
00:00:41.311 --> 00:00:41.900
zero.

14
00:00:41.900 --> 00:00:42.733
<v 1>Right.</v>

15
00:00:54.530 --> 00:00:56.630
<v 0>In AIDS were not easily identified at the start.</v>

16
00:00:56.690 --> 00:00:59.060
It took time for medical researchers to piece together.

17
00:00:59.061 --> 00:01:02.300
The clues that would lead to the identification of a new illness.

18
00:01:02.360 --> 00:01:06.800
The first recorded events in that trail of clues was a morbidity and mortality

19
00:01:06.801 --> 00:01:09.890
reports published by the centers for disease control and prevention.

20
00:01:09.891 --> 00:01:11.450
On June the fifth, 1981.

21
00:01:11.750 --> 00:01:16.250
This report described five cases of a rare type of pneumonia, pneumocystis,

22
00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:17.900
Caryn, I or PCP.

23
00:01:17.990 --> 00:01:21.800
This is a type of infection of the lungs caused by the fungus pneumocystis

24
00:01:21.830 --> 00:01:25.550
jiroveci, which leads to difficulty in breathing a high fever and dry cough.

25
00:01:25.580 --> 00:01:29.420
The patients were young, previously healthy gay men in Los Angeles.

26
00:01:29.480 --> 00:01:33.230
All of them showed signs of severe immune deficiencies. Within days,

27
00:01:33.231 --> 00:01:36.830
doctors across the U S submitted reports of similar cases to the CDC,

28
00:01:37.070 --> 00:01:38.990
less than a month later on the 3rd of July,

29
00:01:38.991 --> 00:01:42.890
the New York times published an article about the outbreak of a rare cancer,

30
00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:47.630
41 gay men in New York and California had been affected by Kaposi's sarcoma and

31
00:01:47.631 --> 00:01:51.470
abnormal growth of small blood vessels. That manifest itself with,

32
00:01:51.500 --> 00:01:53.720
from pink or purple spots on the skin.

33
00:01:53.960 --> 00:01:57.230
It can become life-threatening when it affects the internal organs,

34
00:01:57.320 --> 00:02:01.070
more and more homosexual men fellow with rare conditions. Very often,

35
00:02:01.130 --> 00:02:05.090
they were associated with immune deficiencies in January of 1992,

36
00:02:05.210 --> 00:02:08.630
some of the patients and their friends and families founded gay men's health

37
00:02:08.631 --> 00:02:09.380
crisis.

38
00:02:09.380 --> 00:02:14.000
This organization would become the first nonprofit community-based HIV

39
00:02:14.001 --> 00:02:14.990
service provider,

40
00:02:15.020 --> 00:02:18.950
but at the time they didn't know what they were fighting against. Very soon,

41
00:02:18.951 --> 00:02:22.580
it became clear that whatever was infecting us citizens was not only targeting

42
00:02:22.581 --> 00:02:25.340
homosexuals on July. The 16th of 1982,

43
00:02:25.341 --> 00:02:29.300
a CDC reports featured three cases of PCP and heterosexual.

44
00:02:29.480 --> 00:02:32.540
Hemophiliac men hemophilia is a genetic condition,

45
00:02:32.541 --> 00:02:35.120
which prevents blood from clotting in the 1980s.

46
00:02:35.121 --> 00:02:39.050
Patients suffering from it required frequent blood and plasma transfusions

47
00:02:39.140 --> 00:02:40.070
around the same time.

48
00:02:40.100 --> 00:02:44.540
The first cases of a new disease were being recorded in Sub-Saharan Africa and

49
00:02:44.541 --> 00:02:47.240
Uganda. This disease was nicknamed slim, Jim,

50
00:02:47.241 --> 00:02:49.880
as it caused a massive weight loss among its victims.

51
00:02:49.940 --> 00:02:53.660
Later that year at the time AIDS was first used to identify the new disease.

52
00:02:53.750 --> 00:02:57.800
It was the 24th of September when the CDC released the first definition of AIDS,

53
00:02:57.890 --> 00:02:58.401
a disease,

54
00:02:58.401 --> 00:03:03.220
at least moderately predictive of a defect in cell mediated immunity occurring

55
00:03:03.221 --> 00:03:07.480
in a person with no known cause for diminished resistance to that disease.

56
00:03:07.600 --> 00:03:10.900
Gay men were in a group among which the disease was most prevalent,

57
00:03:10.930 --> 00:03:13.570
but it quickly became the parents that they were by.

58
00:03:13.571 --> 00:03:16.540
No means the only victims in January of 1983,

59
00:03:16.541 --> 00:03:19.090
the CDC recorded the first two female patients.

60
00:03:19.300 --> 00:03:21.700
They were partners of men living with AIDS,

61
00:03:21.701 --> 00:03:25.360
which suggested a sexual transmission of the disease. Firstly,

62
00:03:25.390 --> 00:03:26.920
in may of 1983,

63
00:03:26.921 --> 00:03:30.550
two teams of researchers found the cause behind this new illness.

64
00:03:30.850 --> 00:03:32.380
First was the team headed by Dr.

65
00:03:32.380 --> 00:03:37.180
Francois Barson NuSI and Dr. Luc Montagnier at the pastor Institute in

66
00:03:37.181 --> 00:03:39.130
France, they isolated a virus,

67
00:03:39.131 --> 00:03:42.100
which they believed was responsible for causing AIDS,

68
00:03:42.130 --> 00:03:46.570
which they call the lab or lymphadenopathy associated virus. Later that year,

69
00:03:46.600 --> 00:03:50.860
Dr. Robert Gallo of the national cancer Institute in the U S cultivated lab

70
00:03:50.861 --> 00:03:54.190
specimens in his lab, identifying it as a retrovirus.

71
00:03:54.220 --> 00:03:58.450
This is a type of virus which can insert a DNA copy of its genome into a host

72
00:03:58.451 --> 00:04:01.660
cell in order to replicate in June of 1984,

73
00:04:01.661 --> 00:04:06.400
Dr. Gallo and Dr. Mantini held a joint press conference announcing the

74
00:04:06.401 --> 00:04:10.360
discovery that a retrovirus was responsible for causing AIDS.

75
00:04:10.480 --> 00:04:14.800
The French doctor called it lab Gallo called it HDL V3.

76
00:04:14.920 --> 00:04:18.610
They later changed the names of human immunodeficiency virus, HIV.

77
00:04:25.320 --> 00:04:25.770
<v 2>[Inaudible].</v>

78
00:04:25.770 --> 00:04:30.330
<v 0>Cronin age stands for acquired immunodeficiency syndrome and is the advanced</v>

79
00:04:30.331 --> 00:04:33.240
stage of the infection caused by HIV.

80
00:04:33.300 --> 00:04:37.950
HIV is a rather aggressive virus which targets the cells of the immune system,

81
00:04:38.100 --> 00:04:41.400
making a person more vulnerable to other infections and diseases,

82
00:04:41.401 --> 00:04:43.770
which are called opportunistic infections.

83
00:04:43.880 --> 00:04:47.670
Healthy individual can contract HIV by contact with certain bodily fluids,

84
00:04:47.671 --> 00:04:50.610
from an infected patients with detectable viral load.

85
00:04:50.700 --> 00:04:53.250
Most commonly this happens during unprotected sex.

86
00:04:53.251 --> 00:04:56.220
So through the sharing of injection drug equipments,

87
00:04:56.340 --> 00:04:59.670
a person who is HIV positive is considered to have progressed to AIDS when the

88
00:04:59.671 --> 00:05:04.170
number of their white blood cells of the CD four type falls below 200 cells per

89
00:05:04.171 --> 00:05:05.100
cubic millimeter,

90
00:05:05.220 --> 00:05:09.150
or regardless of their CD four counts when they have developed one or more

91
00:05:09.300 --> 00:05:11.970
opportunistic infections, opportunistic diseases,

92
00:05:11.971 --> 00:05:13.650
most commonly associated with AIDS,

93
00:05:13.651 --> 00:05:17.130
which can often lead to the death of a patients include bacteria and infections

94
00:05:17.131 --> 00:05:19.470
like salmonella, tuberculosis, and pneumonia,

95
00:05:19.530 --> 00:05:24.120
less well-known consequences are fungal infestations like thrush and PCP.

96
00:05:24.150 --> 00:05:24.451
However,

97
00:05:24.451 --> 00:05:28.440
the weakening of immune deficiencies brought about by HIV can also lead to the

98
00:05:28.441 --> 00:05:33.270
onset of certain types of cancer. For instance, lymphoma and Kaposi sarcoma.

99
00:05:33.420 --> 00:05:35.940
As of today, there is no cure for HIV. However,

100
00:05:35.941 --> 00:05:40.590
certain treatment regimens known as hot or highly active antiretroviral

101
00:05:40.591 --> 00:05:45.360
therapy can help patients live with HIV without it degenerating into AIDS.

102
00:05:45.361 --> 00:05:48.750
And we'll get into those a little bit later without this therapy.

103
00:05:48.751 --> 00:05:52.290
People with AIDS typically survive about three years. Sadly,

104
00:05:52.291 --> 00:05:56.940
if they contract a dangerous opportunistic illness that life expectancy falls to

105
00:05:57.260 --> 00:05:57.980
one year,

106
00:05:57.980 --> 00:06:01.820
patients who are HIV positive can live for 10 to 15 years without any noticeable

107
00:06:01.821 --> 00:06:05.060
symptoms. And even if they manifest, they can be easily mistaken,

108
00:06:05.240 --> 00:06:10.160
but those of a less serious illness like flu when HIV degenerates into AIDS,

109
00:06:10.161 --> 00:06:14.180
common symptoms include rapid weight, loss, diarrhea, fatigue, memory loss,

110
00:06:14.300 --> 00:06:15.410
and depression. Again,

111
00:06:15.440 --> 00:06:19.790
these symptoms are not exclusive to AIDS and can be related to other illnesses.

112
00:06:20.030 --> 00:06:24.290
That is why the only certain way to diagnose HIV and AIDS is to get the

113
00:06:24.291 --> 00:06:27.950
appropriate test, to avoid an uncontrolled spread of the infection.

114
00:06:28.070 --> 00:06:30.680
The most common way is through which AIDS is transmitted,

115
00:06:30.770 --> 00:06:33.770
it's unprotected sex and the sharing of needles by drug users.

116
00:06:33.771 --> 00:06:37.220
But there are other less common avenues. For example,

117
00:06:37.221 --> 00:06:41.750
a mother can pass HIV to a child during pregnancy birth or breastfeeding.

118
00:06:42.050 --> 00:06:45.740
There have been cases of health workers being infected when handling HIV

119
00:06:45.741 --> 00:06:47.990
contaminated needles or other sharp objects,

120
00:06:48.020 --> 00:06:51.650
particularly if they are not utilizing the recommended personal protective

121
00:06:51.651 --> 00:06:52.310
equipment.

122
00:06:52.310 --> 00:06:56.270
A patient may also receive a transfusion of blood or plasma from a donor who was

123
00:06:56.271 --> 00:06:57.260
HIV positive.

124
00:06:57.350 --> 00:07:01.580
Nowadays this risk is extremely low because of the scrutiny that blood donations

125
00:07:02.120 --> 00:07:02.150
received,

126
00:07:02.150 --> 00:07:06.230
but there had been many cases recorded in the early 1980s before rigorous

127
00:07:06.231 --> 00:07:08.270
testing was put in place. Finally,

128
00:07:08.271 --> 00:07:12.860
there is an extremely low risk of contracting HIV via oral contact.

129
00:07:12.920 --> 00:07:15.890
For example, if an individual is bitten by an infected patient,

130
00:07:15.891 --> 00:07:20.690
or if two partners base with bleeding gums or mouth ulcers share a deep kiss

131
00:07:20.780 --> 00:07:25.670
HIV, absolutely can't be spread by insect bites, physical contact, uh,

132
00:07:25.790 --> 00:07:28.460
water, saliva, tears, or sweats.

133
00:07:28.670 --> 00:07:33.170
HIV could affect anyone regardless of sexual orientation, race, ethnicity,

134
00:07:33.230 --> 00:07:35.060
gender, or age. However,

135
00:07:35.090 --> 00:07:38.360
certain groups are at a higher risk of contracting HIV.

136
00:07:38.600 --> 00:07:42.170
The records of the centers for disease control and prevention show that in the U

137
00:07:42.171 --> 00:07:45.110
S certain demographics are more likely to get this virus.

138
00:07:45.170 --> 00:07:48.800
According to 2018 CDC statistics, gay, bisexual,

139
00:07:48.801 --> 00:07:53.420
and other men who have sex with men accounted for 69% of all new HIV

140
00:07:54.290 --> 00:07:55.400
diagnoses. The next largest category,

141
00:07:55.450 --> 00:07:59.720
it was heterosexual is accounting for 24% of new cases followed by injection

142
00:07:59.721 --> 00:08:00.381
drug users.

143
00:08:00.381 --> 00:08:05.120
At 7% records show that the incidents of new cases disproportionately

144
00:08:05.180 --> 00:08:07.460
affects ethnic minorities. For example,

145
00:08:08.390 --> 00:08:11.980
African-Americans are about 13% of the overall population in the U S and yet

146
00:08:12.170 --> 00:08:16.970
they accounts for 42% of the newly infected Hispanic saw 18% of the population,

147
00:08:16.971 --> 00:08:21.770
but account for 27% of the HIV positive people who identify as white are

148
00:08:21.771 --> 00:08:23.630
70% of us citizens,

149
00:08:23.660 --> 00:08:27.440
but they are just a quarter of the overall instant patients.

150
00:08:27.560 --> 00:08:29.930
All things considered gay African-American men,

151
00:08:29.960 --> 00:08:33.830
all the category at highest risk of contracting HIV representing

152
00:08:33.831 --> 00:08:35.960
25% of all cases.

153
00:08:42.040 --> 00:08:42.130
<v 3>[Inaudible].</v>

154
00:08:42.130 --> 00:08:43.570
<v 0>So let's go back to the 1980s.</v>

155
00:08:43.660 --> 00:08:47.320
It was becoming clear to medical professionals and even part of the general

156
00:08:47.321 --> 00:08:49.330
public that this new disease favored.

157
00:08:49.331 --> 00:08:54.070
Certain groups defined as the four H's homosexuals, heroin addicts,

158
00:08:54.130 --> 00:08:56.400
haemophiliacs, and Haitian immigrants.

159
00:08:56.460 --> 00:09:01.110
The first advocacy group started to take shape in 1983 on may the second people

160
00:09:01.111 --> 00:09:04.830
with AIDS stage their first public demonstration in San Francisco.

161
00:09:04.860 --> 00:09:07.500
In the following months, patient groups issued the Denver principles,

162
00:09:07.620 --> 00:09:10.800
a charter stating their right to be involved in policy decisions and to be

163
00:09:10.801 --> 00:09:14.910
called people with AIDS, not AIDS victims. On the 22nd of November,

164
00:09:14.911 --> 00:09:19.020
the world health organization held its first meeting to assess the global impact

165
00:09:19.021 --> 00:09:20.250
of AIDS. By this date,

166
00:09:20.251 --> 00:09:24.360
at least one case of the disease had been reported in each region of the world.

167
00:09:24.510 --> 00:09:25.770
It took another couple of years though,

168
00:09:25.771 --> 00:09:28.470
before AIDS fully entered the public consciousness. First,

169
00:09:28.471 --> 00:09:32.120
it was thanks to an Indiana teenager on June, the 30th, Ryan White,

170
00:09:32.130 --> 00:09:35.490
a boy living with hemophilia was denied admission to a local school.

171
00:09:35.580 --> 00:09:38.160
He had been infected with HIV from a blood transfusion.

172
00:09:38.310 --> 00:09:42.060
Ryan went on to speak publicly against the stigma and discrimination that many

173
00:09:42.061 --> 00:09:45.480
AIDS patients experienced. The other event was the death of rock Hudson.

174
00:09:45.481 --> 00:09:46.620
On the 2nd of October,

175
00:09:46.830 --> 00:09:51.060
the legendary Hollywood actor died of AIDS leaving $250,000 to help set up the

176
00:09:51.061 --> 00:09:55.320
American foundation for AIDS research or amfAR fellow actress.

177
00:09:55.350 --> 00:09:58.470
Elizabeth Taylor acted as national chairperson for amfAR,

178
00:09:58.500 --> 00:10:01.800
which gave a further boost to the disease awareness efforts.

179
00:10:01.860 --> 00:10:04.380
The first few years of the epidemic and their impact,

180
00:10:04.381 --> 00:10:08.250
especially on the gay community were recorded in the 1987 book.

181
00:10:08.280 --> 00:10:10.530
And the band played on by Randy Shilts,

182
00:10:10.531 --> 00:10:12.780
a journalist at the San Francisco Chronicle.

183
00:10:12.840 --> 00:10:14.760
The book introduced a real life character,

184
00:10:14.790 --> 00:10:18.510
the gay Canadian flight attendant to its succumb to AIDS on March the 30th,

185
00:10:18.540 --> 00:10:21.780
1984. Thanks to his good looks. Charisma field of work,

186
00:10:21.781 --> 00:10:24.990
the flight attendant traveled across the country having a string of sexual

187
00:10:24.991 --> 00:10:27.420
encounters along the way. Apparently in a typical year,

188
00:10:27.570 --> 00:10:31.200
you could have up to 251 night stands while researching his book.

189
00:10:31.500 --> 00:10:33.060
Schultz came across the cluster study,

190
00:10:33.061 --> 00:10:37.050
published in the American journal of medicine with this study CDC investigators,

191
00:10:37.051 --> 00:10:40.440
or to drop a map of sexual encounters among several people with AIDS.

192
00:10:40.650 --> 00:10:44.790
The study featured a diagram illustrating this network of relationships at the

193
00:10:44.791 --> 00:10:48.900
center of the largest cluster responsible for directly infecting eight patients.

194
00:10:49.080 --> 00:10:53.820
This paper had identified one person as patient zero. According to Schiltz,

195
00:10:53.821 --> 00:10:57.210
this patient was ultimately responsible for introducing HIV and AIDS to the

196
00:10:57.211 --> 00:11:00.750
United States. For years after Schultz's work had been published.

197
00:11:00.751 --> 00:11:04.080
A medical addiction rate still refers to patient zero as an individual

198
00:11:04.081 --> 00:11:07.950
identified as the person who introduced HIV in the United States.

199
00:11:07.980 --> 00:11:11.550
According to CDC records, patient zero and airlines do it. In fact,

200
00:11:11.660 --> 00:11:13.950
nearly 50 other persons before he died,

201
00:11:14.080 --> 00:11:17.220
acquired immunodeficiency syndrome in 1984,

202
00:11:17.370 --> 00:11:20.730
that airline Stewart was the Canadian flight attendant we discussed earlier,

203
00:11:20.790 --> 00:11:22.830
and his name was Gayton Douga.

204
00:11:29.810 --> 00:11:33.230
It was born in Quebec city, Canada on February the 20th, 1953.

205
00:11:33.320 --> 00:11:35.600
He worked for a period as a hairdresser in Toronto,

206
00:11:35.630 --> 00:11:37.460
before moving to Vancouver there,

207
00:11:37.461 --> 00:11:39.860
he realized his dream of becoming a flight attendants,

208
00:11:39.861 --> 00:11:43.490
working for our Canada while on duty. He frequently traveled across Europe,

209
00:11:43.491 --> 00:11:47.990
the Caribbean and the us with his favorite destination being San Francisco would

210
00:11:47.991 --> 00:11:49.820
love to attend the annual pride parades.

211
00:11:50.150 --> 00:11:53.770
He flew to San Francisco as often as he could enjoying many of the sexual

212
00:11:53.771 --> 00:11:58.050
encounters. That Gaten was 26. When he first displayed symptoms of ill health.

213
00:11:58.240 --> 00:12:01.630
In this case, swollen lymph nodes. A year later in 1980,

214
00:12:01.631 --> 00:12:05.560
Brown spots appeared under his skin Gaten at the object to the biopsy,

215
00:12:05.561 --> 00:12:07.870
which revealed that he had Kaposi's sarcoma.

216
00:12:08.400 --> 00:12:11.620
Gaten had to undergo several cycles of chemotherapy with all the side effects

217
00:12:11.621 --> 00:12:15.520
that go along with that from inconvenience to agonizing pain,

218
00:12:15.580 --> 00:12:19.030
despite losing much weight and all of his hair gazing continued to sports,

219
00:12:19.330 --> 00:12:23.200
cutting edge, look wearing fashionable headbands and designer clothing.

220
00:12:23.260 --> 00:12:23.860
By this point,

221
00:12:23.860 --> 00:12:27.490
the clinical community had linked Kaposi's do the new disease targeting

222
00:12:27.491 --> 00:12:31.870
homosexuals. It was referred to as gay cancer and a letter to Ray Redford,

223
00:12:31.871 --> 00:12:35.500
a format lover and friends do go out, described his mental stages.

224
00:12:35.530 --> 00:12:39.250
He tried to learn more about the disease and to keep it symptoms at Bay,

225
00:12:39.310 --> 00:12:42.700
he wrote my mind is finding peace again. You are right.

226
00:12:42.820 --> 00:12:45.910
I must upgrade my attitude towards a full recovery, but you know,

227
00:12:45.940 --> 00:12:48.910
there is always the storm that strike you when less expected.

228
00:12:49.030 --> 00:12:52.930
The CDC started interviewing gay men with Kaposi sarcoma and soon realized that

229
00:12:52.931 --> 00:12:55.120
at least four of them had slept with Gaten,

230
00:12:55.660 --> 00:13:00.010
took parts in this cost to study two cooperating, eagerly and volunteering.

231
00:13:00.040 --> 00:13:02.890
Plenty of detailed information on the names and addresses of his previous

232
00:13:02.891 --> 00:13:03.430
partners.

233
00:13:03.430 --> 00:13:07.210
The CDC made it clear to gate that the new deadly illness may have been spread

234
00:13:07.211 --> 00:13:10.000
sexually. According to Schiltz in November of 1982,

235
00:13:10.600 --> 00:13:14.680
Gaden Duka was even confronted by a San Francisco public health official about

236
00:13:14.681 --> 00:13:19.270
his sexual habits was asked to avoid having sex prevent further spreading of the

237
00:13:19.271 --> 00:13:22.060
disease, but he flatly refused. It was his right.

238
00:13:22.061 --> 00:13:24.760
He said to do what he wanted with his body. By that time,

239
00:13:24.870 --> 00:13:27.700
do you go ahead and move to San Francisco permanently anti frequency,

240
00:13:27.730 --> 00:13:30.130
the local bath houses looking for new partners,

241
00:13:30.190 --> 00:13:33.730
his success streak was such to Rouse the jealousy of other gay men in the area.

242
00:13:33.760 --> 00:13:36.190
Some even conspired to have him evicted from the town.

243
00:13:36.340 --> 00:13:38.110
It was because of behaviors such as this,

244
00:13:38.111 --> 00:13:42.700
that Schiltz harshly branded duga as the equivocal version of typhoid,

245
00:13:42.701 --> 00:13:46.720
Mary eventually left San Francisco and resettled in Vancouver.

246
00:13:46.780 --> 00:13:50.110
His body was now consumed with opportunistic infections,

247
00:13:50.111 --> 00:13:53.440
the most serious one being PCP, the fungal pneumonia,

248
00:13:53.500 --> 00:13:57.700
the infection progressed inexorably Gaten moved back to his native Quebec city

249
00:13:57.850 --> 00:14:02.200
where he passed away on March the 30th, 1984, age 31.

250
00:14:02.320 --> 00:14:05.200
The cluster study was published some weeks after his death,

251
00:14:05.290 --> 00:14:09.930
all the remains of Gaytan for life. It was a circle at the center of a diagram.

252
00:14:10.170 --> 00:14:14.640
It was connected, do eight other circles, LA three, six, eight, and nine.

253
00:14:14.910 --> 00:14:19.820
And NYU three, four, nine, and 15 Gayton circle was marked by zero.

254
00:14:20.250 --> 00:14:22.740
The only thing is it was not a zero.

255
00:14:23.160 --> 00:14:27.540
It was the letter O the cluster study marked its participant by location.

256
00:14:28.020 --> 00:14:30.510
Gayton Dougal had been recorded as out of California,

257
00:14:30.570 --> 00:14:32.940
or simply over short Randy Shilts.

258
00:14:32.941 --> 00:14:36.240
His work had been critics with Cambridge historian, Richard McKay among them.

259
00:14:36.600 --> 00:14:40.170
McCay points out that Shilts misunderstood the letter over a number zero.

260
00:14:40.230 --> 00:14:43.380
The diagram of the cluster study was not supposed to illustrate what may have

261
00:14:43.381 --> 00:14:46.980
been the epicenter of the pandemic in the U S it was intended to find a link

262
00:14:46.981 --> 00:14:51.090
between two outbreaks of Kaposi sarcoma and other opportunistic illnesses.

263
00:14:51.110 --> 00:14:54.350
One on the West coast and the other on that East Gasten, Oh,

264
00:14:54.590 --> 00:14:58.040
went to certain SF one where the links between East and West,

265
00:14:58.280 --> 00:15:00.650
the Gaten just happened to be placed at the center.

266
00:15:00.830 --> 00:15:03.680
Some of the other interviewees in the study were as promiscuous,

267
00:15:03.681 --> 00:15:06.260
if not more so than Douga, but they could not,

268
00:15:06.380 --> 00:15:09.530
or would not provide as many details as the Canadian stearate.

269
00:15:09.740 --> 00:15:14.240
Hence his circle marks with an O appeared as more interconnected to other men.

270
00:15:14.510 --> 00:15:17.570
That's why it was easier to represent them graphically at the center of the

271
00:15:18.170 --> 00:15:18.590
diagram.

272
00:15:18.590 --> 00:15:22.430
Schultz is that as a Michael Denny admitted that the two had overplayed the

273
00:15:22.431 --> 00:15:25.760
responsibilities of dougga in the epidemic in order to make,

274
00:15:25.761 --> 00:15:27.440
and the band played on more appealing.

275
00:15:27.560 --> 00:15:31.040
They painted Gaten as the villain of the piece, patient zero,

276
00:15:31.041 --> 00:15:32.570
the typhoid Gary,

277
00:15:32.571 --> 00:15:37.220
if you like introduced HIV and AIDS to the U S the intention was ultimately

278
00:15:37.221 --> 00:15:40.550
noble increased circulation of the book to raise awareness about HIV,

279
00:15:40.610 --> 00:15:44.330
as well as the stigma and indifferent suffered by gay people with AIDS at the

280
00:15:44.331 --> 00:15:46.850
hands of authorities and the public, but in doing so,

281
00:15:46.851 --> 00:15:51.170
the book created the full Smith of patient zero scapegoats in gate and do gap.

282
00:15:51.230 --> 00:15:53.870
Even if the Canadian man was not an actual patient,

283
00:15:53.871 --> 00:15:58.340
zero shelter's book makes it clear that he stubbornly continued to spread HIV

284
00:15:58.490 --> 00:16:02.090
through unprotected sex, but that claim is disputed as well.

285
00:16:02.120 --> 00:16:06.650
The CDC first data that AIDS was sexually transmitted in January of 1983

286
00:16:06.830 --> 00:16:10.310
Gayden's discussions with the CDC and the San Francisco health official took

287
00:16:10.311 --> 00:16:14.630
place in 1982, Dugas behavior was certainly promiscuous.

288
00:16:14.631 --> 00:16:18.260
He definitely lacked caution, but it wasn't as brazenly,

289
00:16:18.261 --> 00:16:20.300
irresponsible as portrayed in the book.

290
00:16:20.330 --> 00:16:23.330
He was not consciously infecting as many menisci Curt.

291
00:16:23.420 --> 00:16:28.370
What really matters to us is that HIV in the U S did not start with Gaten.

292
00:16:28.640 --> 00:16:31.310
It most likely cannot be traced to one single individual,

293
00:16:31.311 --> 00:16:35.960
and most likely did not start in the late 1970s or early 1980s.

294
00:16:36.050 --> 00:16:39.680
Considering the HIV you can take as long as 15 years to display symptoms,

295
00:16:39.890 --> 00:16:44.210
many people could have been infected long before then in October of 1987,

296
00:16:44.211 --> 00:16:48.200
an article in the Chicago Tribune reported a story about tests, wrong samples,

297
00:16:48.350 --> 00:16:50.690
belonging to a teenage male, for instance, Louis,

298
00:16:50.720 --> 00:16:53.600
the samples tested positive for HIV. And in fact,

299
00:16:53.601 --> 00:16:58.520
the individual had died from an AIDS like condition in 1969 and nature

300
00:16:58.521 --> 00:16:59.770
article in 1990,

301
00:16:59.840 --> 00:17:03.350
it found that tissue samples from a British sailor had also tested positive for

302
00:17:03.351 --> 00:17:04.184
HIV.

303
00:17:04.490 --> 00:17:09.320
It died in Manchester from PCP in 1959 Moakley it was pointed

304
00:17:09.321 --> 00:17:11.870
to an earlier origin of the disease and to a location,

305
00:17:11.871 --> 00:17:14.660
many miles away from North America in 1983,

306
00:17:14.661 --> 00:17:17.420
a joint Belgian and American research trip to Ziad.

307
00:17:17.450 --> 00:17:21.920
Now the democratic Republic of Congo established that a similar disease to AIDS.

308
00:17:21.921 --> 00:17:26.240
It was widespread that affecting mainly heterosexual men and women in 1987

309
00:17:26.241 --> 00:17:26.841
medical journal,

310
00:17:26.841 --> 00:17:30.890
the Lancet found evidence of HIV like infections in central Africa,

311
00:17:31.070 --> 00:17:32.510
dating back to 1959.

312
00:17:32.630 --> 00:17:36.230
Researchers were closing in on the place of origin of this plague of the 21st

313
00:17:36.231 --> 00:17:38.330
century. And it was Sub-Saharan Africa.

314
00:17:43.690 --> 00:17:44.523
<v 5>Uh.</v>

315
00:17:45.130 --> 00:17:49.290
<v 0>The credited ferries on the origins of AIDS is the one dubbed cops.</v>

316
00:17:49.320 --> 00:17:50.190
Hunter theory.

317
00:17:50.340 --> 00:17:54.780
One of the proponents is microbiologist Jack pay Paul in his 2011,

318
00:17:54.781 --> 00:17:58.920
works the origin of AIDS see proposes a likely travel route from central Africa

319
00:17:59.100 --> 00:18:01.470
to North America and the rest of the world.

320
00:18:02.160 --> 00:18:05.490
HIV likely originated as a pathogen in primate populations.

321
00:18:05.491 --> 00:18:09.960
Most probably chimpanzees late stage infected chimps developed a syndrome called

322
00:18:09.961 --> 00:18:14.250
Sid Simian immunodeficiency sometime in the early 1920s,

323
00:18:14.251 --> 00:18:15.720
the virus jumped species.

324
00:18:15.750 --> 00:18:19.500
This is when the virus somehow relocated from an infected ape into the

325
00:18:19.501 --> 00:18:21.000
bloodstream of a human.

326
00:18:21.060 --> 00:18:24.870
The most likely candidates would be a Hunter whose open wounds were infected by

327
00:18:24.871 --> 00:18:29.640
the chimpanzees blood, the cut Hunter. In other words, in the 1920s and 1930s,

328
00:18:29.641 --> 00:18:31.020
French equatorial Africa,

329
00:18:31.140 --> 00:18:34.290
and the Belgian Congo enjoyed close trade and employment ties,

330
00:18:34.320 --> 00:18:38.190
meaning that any infected individual could have traveled across highly populated

331
00:18:38.191 --> 00:18:42.750
centers by short boat rides, spreading the disease further and further PayPal.

332
00:18:42.780 --> 00:18:43.290
In fact,

333
00:18:43.290 --> 00:18:46.920
found evidence of a disease similar to AIDS causing an outbreak in a railway

334
00:18:46.921 --> 00:18:51.180
camp in French equatorial Africa in the 1920s and 19, 1930s,

335
00:18:51.270 --> 00:18:56.160
HIV may have spread via sexual contact, but also via estrogenic transmission.

336
00:18:56.310 --> 00:19:00.600
These are infections caused by doctors, reissuing unsterilized needles,

337
00:19:00.660 --> 00:19:01.590
travelers, and sailors.

338
00:19:01.620 --> 00:19:05.940
Visiting central Africa may have contracted HIV as early as the 1950s. However,

339
00:19:06.330 --> 00:19:08.790
PayPal was able to establish with more certainty,

340
00:19:08.970 --> 00:19:12.570
a link between Zaja and the Caribbean. During the 1960s,

341
00:19:12.571 --> 00:19:15.330
several thousand Haitian were recruited to work in Zaja.

342
00:19:15.420 --> 00:19:19.620
It is possible that many of them became HIV positive and carried the infection

343
00:19:19.621 --> 00:19:23.820
back to their country from hazy HIV made its way to North America via two

344
00:19:23.821 --> 00:19:27.240
avenues, the trans national blood industry and sex tourism,

345
00:19:27.360 --> 00:19:30.270
a study published in nature in October, 2016,

346
00:19:30.420 --> 00:19:34.830
ascertains that blood and plasma collected from Haiti by New York hospital was

347
00:19:34.831 --> 00:19:37.020
indeed HIV positive by Cambridge,

348
00:19:37.021 --> 00:19:40.860
a story and Richard McKay argues that Haiti was a popular destination for

349
00:19:40.861 --> 00:19:44.880
American gay men. Looking for sexual liaisons from these two entry points,

350
00:19:44.881 --> 00:19:47.970
the virus gradually spread to haemophiliacs, heroin uses,

351
00:19:48.270 --> 00:19:49.860
and time of sexuals ends. Of course,

352
00:19:49.861 --> 00:19:54.120
there are scores of potential Haitian immigrants jumping the Gulf to the United

353
00:19:54.120 --> 00:19:54.150
States.

354
00:19:54.150 --> 00:19:58.380
The four H's that we already mentioned through the effects of paper Mackay and

355
00:19:58.381 --> 00:19:59.220
other researchers.

356
00:19:59.490 --> 00:20:04.200
It is clear now that the whole concept of Douga as patient zero is

357
00:20:04.230 --> 00:20:05.430
more or less debunked.

358
00:20:05.490 --> 00:20:09.300
The first outbreak of what could be called AIDS dates back at least half a

359
00:20:09.301 --> 00:20:10.260
century before.

360
00:20:10.470 --> 00:20:14.940
And it went completely undetected before it swelled into what appeared to be an

361
00:20:14.941 --> 00:20:16.050
unstoppable pandemic.

362
00:20:22.250 --> 00:20:22.970
<v 6>Since the beginning.</v>

363
00:20:22.970 --> 00:20:23.571
<v 0>You have the epidemic.</v>

364
00:20:23.571 --> 00:20:27.500
76 million people have been infected with the HIV virus and about

365
00:20:27.501 --> 00:20:31.580
33 million people have died of AIDS related infections.

366
00:20:31.700 --> 00:20:35.270
Luckily advances in medical science have made it possible for HIV positive

367
00:20:35.271 --> 00:20:37.550
patients to live much longer than ever before.

368
00:20:37.610 --> 00:20:41.330
What used to be a fatal disease has now become a chronic illness.

369
00:20:41.510 --> 00:20:42.380
It can't be cured,

370
00:20:42.530 --> 00:20:46.520
but it can be managed through the regular use of antiretroviral drugs.

371
00:20:46.640 --> 00:20:51.460
The first treatment indicated for HIV was approved by the FDA in 1987 in July of

372
00:20:51.461 --> 00:20:56.380
1996, the 11th international AIDS conference established hot is a breakthrough

373
00:20:56.381 --> 00:21:01.030
approach leading to a drop in morbidity and mortality advances in other disease

374
00:21:01.031 --> 00:21:05.200
areas have also made it possible to prevent or treat the symptoms of the most

375
00:21:05.201 --> 00:21:07.390
common opportunistic illnesses. However,

376
00:21:07.420 --> 00:21:12.340
HIV and AIDS are far from being completely defeated at the end of 2019,

377
00:21:12.341 --> 00:21:16.330
about 38 million people were estimated to be living with HIV across the globe.

378
00:21:16.360 --> 00:21:19.540
During that scene, yet 690,000 people died of AIDS.

379
00:21:19.630 --> 00:21:23.320
300,000 of them died in Eastern and Southern Africa alone.

380
00:21:23.470 --> 00:21:25.390
Despite some advancements in treatment rates,

381
00:21:25.480 --> 00:21:30.040
Sub-Saharan Africa is still the region suffering the most from HIV and amongst

382
00:21:30.041 --> 00:21:34.960
the infected about three fifths or women and young girls, according to UN AIDS,

383
00:21:34.961 --> 00:21:38.170
the joint United nations program on HIV AIDS.

384
00:21:38.290 --> 00:21:42.460
The progress of the HIV crisis is related to the low supply of

385
00:21:42.461 --> 00:21:44.770
antiretroviral therapies. Naturally,

386
00:21:44.830 --> 00:21:49.300
this is a situation which may be exacerbated by the concurrent pandemic.

387
00:21:49.301 --> 00:21:51.670
We are now going through with COVID-19,

388
00:21:51.730 --> 00:21:55.810
but UN AIDS identifies another set of reasons. Gender inequalities,

389
00:21:55.930 --> 00:21:59.890
lack of access to secondary education for girls scarcity of sexual and

390
00:21:59.950 --> 00:22:03.190
reproductive health services. There's also the ongoing stigma,

391
00:22:03.191 --> 00:22:05.140
which prevents HIV, positive people,

392
00:22:05.141 --> 00:22:09.070
and at-risk populations from seeking treatments and preventative advice.

393
00:22:09.220 --> 00:22:12.220
Now we've mainly focused on the American HIV story,

394
00:22:12.250 --> 00:22:17.200
but here today's conclusion, I'd like to bring things closer to home. In 1987,

395
00:22:17.201 --> 00:22:21.880
millions of households in the UK received an information booklet on the risks of

396
00:22:21.881 --> 00:22:25.360
HIV and AIDS. The booklet was tying to an effective TV ad campaign,

397
00:22:25.361 --> 00:22:29.770
and it used Frank language on the matter of transmission VAR sexual intercourse.

398
00:22:29.830 --> 00:22:33.820
The tagline of this department of health campaign was don't die of ignorance.

399
00:22:34.030 --> 00:22:38.380
It drove the point home during any public crisis knowledge and the responsible

400
00:22:38.381 --> 00:22:42.310
behavior that grows out of this are really key. As you've seen today,

401
00:22:42.550 --> 00:22:45.790
ignorance about the disease caused millions to die,

402
00:22:46.120 --> 00:22:51.010
that ignorance and its brother prejudice can also isolate condemn and

403
00:22:51.011 --> 00:22:54.220
taint the memory of those who don't deserve it.

404
00:22:56.290 --> 00:22:58.990
So I really hope you found today's video. Interesting. If you did,
