6
00:00:23.690 --> 00:00:27.290
On the morning of January the 15th, 1947 Los Angeles resident,

7
00:00:27.291 --> 00:00:31.040
Betty Bazinga was walking with a young daughter through Leimert park.

8
00:00:31.160 --> 00:00:35.510
When she came upon an unexpected site in a vacant lots on South Northern Avenue,

9
00:00:35.540 --> 00:00:37.610
there was what appeared to be a naked body,

10
00:00:37.611 --> 00:00:40.640
completely split into two halves at the waist.

11
00:00:40.730 --> 00:00:44.930
The scene was so shocking that Mrs Bazinga immediately dismissed it as simply

12
00:00:44.931 --> 00:00:47.210
being a store mannequin that had been thrown away.

13
00:00:47.300 --> 00:00:50.870
It wasn't until she got closer, that she made a gruesome realization.

14
00:00:51.110 --> 00:00:54.950
She was looking at the very real body of a young woman who had been slain

15
00:00:55.550 --> 00:01:00.260
drained of blood cut into and posed Mrs. Bazinga runaway in

16
00:01:00.620 --> 00:01:01.910
Tara and alerted the authorities,

17
00:01:02.150 --> 00:01:05.240
the eventual arrival of the police and the media triggered the start of one of

18
00:01:05.241 --> 00:01:08.030
the most infamous criminal investigations in history.

19
00:01:08.180 --> 00:01:13.040
One which still remains a dark mystery. The case of the black Dahlia.

20
00:01:18.290 --> 00:01:19.100
<v 1>[Inaudible].</v>

21
00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:23.000
<v 0>It wasn't long before the grisly discovery attracted an audience to play witness</v>

22
00:01:23.001 --> 00:01:25.970
to a scene that made even hardened police officers shut up.

23
00:01:26.180 --> 00:01:29.450
Besides the fact that the young woman's body had been cut in two between the

24
00:01:29.451 --> 00:01:31.280
second and third lumbar vertebrae,

25
00:01:31.550 --> 00:01:36.410
it had also suffered extensive mutilation to the face breasts and genitals that

26
00:01:36.620 --> 00:01:37.760
appears to have been done.

27
00:01:37.761 --> 00:01:41.660
Post-mortem there were also signs that the women had been tied up with ligature

28
00:01:41.661 --> 00:01:44.360
restraints and sexually assaulted before a death.

29
00:01:44.480 --> 00:01:47.510
The autopsy concluded that she had been killed about 10 hours prior to her

30
00:01:47.511 --> 00:01:51.530
discovery and the official cause of death was hemorrhage and shock due to

31
00:01:51.531 --> 00:01:54.560
concussion of the brain and lacerations of the face.

32
00:01:54.620 --> 00:01:57.800
The killer was clearly very proud of his work and wanted to display it as best

33
00:01:57.801 --> 00:02:01.130
as possible. There was not a single drop of blood at the scene,

34
00:02:01.340 --> 00:02:03.800
not on the body and not on the ground.

35
00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:08.210
The murderer took the time to clean the cops with gasoline and then pose it in a

36
00:02:08.240 --> 00:02:11.930
degrading position with the hands above the head and the legs spread wide open

37
00:02:11.931 --> 00:02:15.230
with the intestines gathered in a pile at the lower half of the body,

38
00:02:15.410 --> 00:02:18.230
the victim was left just a few feet away from the sidewalk.

39
00:02:18.290 --> 00:02:22.070
It was pretty obvious that the killer not only made no attempts to conceal his

40
00:02:22.071 --> 00:02:24.920
gruesome deed, but actually wanted it to be.

41
00:02:31.670 --> 00:02:31.990
<v 1>[Inaudible].</v>

42
00:02:31.990 --> 00:02:32.480
<v 0>It's vulnerable.</v>

43
00:02:32.480 --> 00:02:35.630
Do you prove to be quite easy for the Los Angeles police departments brought in

44
00:02:35.631 --> 00:02:39.500
the FBI to help with the investigation and they already have the victim's

45
00:02:39.501 --> 00:02:43.310
fingerprints on file just 56 minutes after sending the Prince to Washington

46
00:02:43.670 --> 00:02:45.920
Vajra primitive fax machine called a sound photo,

47
00:02:46.190 --> 00:02:49.340
the woman was identified as 22 year old Elizabeth Short,

48
00:02:49.370 --> 00:02:52.430
who wants applied for a clerk job at the camp cook army commerce or in

49
00:02:52.431 --> 00:02:55.190
California. They even had a mugshot of her as short,

50
00:02:55.280 --> 00:02:57.170
had been arrested once for underage drinking.

51
00:02:57.270 --> 00:03:01.690
Elizabeth Short was born on July the 20, 1924 in Boston, Massachusetts.

52
00:03:01.870 --> 00:03:05.140
The third of five daughters of Cleo and Phoebe may short,

53
00:03:05.440 --> 00:03:07.720
her childhood was also filled with tragedy.

54
00:03:07.780 --> 00:03:11.350
Initially her father had been a moderately successful businessmen who built

55
00:03:11.351 --> 00:03:12.370
miniature golf courses,

56
00:03:12.610 --> 00:03:16.540
but then the stock market crashed in 1929 and he lost almost all of his savings.

57
00:03:16.750 --> 00:03:20.260
The following year Cleo's car was found abandoned on the Charlestown bridge in

58
00:03:20.261 --> 00:03:20.771
Boston.

59
00:03:20.771 --> 00:03:24.640
And everyone concluded that he had committed suicide by jumping into the river

60
00:03:24.730 --> 00:03:28.480
left alone with five children to raise Phoebe may have to sell the house and

61
00:03:28.510 --> 00:03:31.720
move into a smaller apartment while working as a bookkeeper to support our

62
00:03:31.721 --> 00:03:33.190
family, to add to our troubles.

63
00:03:33.250 --> 00:03:36.550
Elizabeth was a sickly child who suffered from severe asthma attacks and

64
00:03:36.551 --> 00:03:40.120
bronchitis and needed lung surgery when she was just 15 years old.

65
00:03:40.300 --> 00:03:43.060
But Elizabeth story took an unexpected turn in 1942.

66
00:03:43.061 --> 00:03:46.750
When the family received a letter from her presumed to be deceased father,

67
00:03:46.840 --> 00:03:48.850
as it turned out, he did not kill himself,

68
00:03:48.880 --> 00:03:52.480
but he did decide to leave his family and start a new life in California.

69
00:03:52.720 --> 00:03:54.010
And now years later,

70
00:03:54.160 --> 00:03:57.970
he finally had worked up the courage to tell them the truth and to apologize,

71
00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:00.940
the idea of starting over in a new place, appealed to Elizabeth,

72
00:04:00.970 --> 00:04:03.100
who had recently dropped out of high school,

73
00:04:03.101 --> 00:04:06.550
but who was also told by her doctors that it would be better for her to spend

74
00:04:06.551 --> 00:04:11.050
winters somewhere with a mile to climates, to alleviate a respiratory problems.

75
00:04:11.110 --> 00:04:12.430
Therefore, when she turns 18,

76
00:04:12.431 --> 00:04:15.850
she left Massachusetts and joins her father in VA who California,

77
00:04:15.880 --> 00:04:18.190
this new relationship, however, did not last long.

78
00:04:18.280 --> 00:04:22.030
Elizabeth and Cleo argued a lot. So now in 1943, she moved out.

79
00:04:22.060 --> 00:04:24.970
Once she found a job at the AFA mentioned camp cook.

80
00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:28.270
She bounced between places for a while. Before she relocated to Florida,

81
00:04:28.390 --> 00:04:31.720
they actually met an army Apple's officer names, major Matthew Michael Gordon,

82
00:04:31.721 --> 00:04:35.320
Jr. Unfortunately, their romance was cut short by world war two.

83
00:04:35.430 --> 00:04:38.620
As the pilot was deployed to the Indian theater whilst recovering from injuries

84
00:04:38.621 --> 00:04:41.860
sustained in the crash. Gordon wrote to shorts to propose marriage.

85
00:04:42.100 --> 00:04:44.710
She accepted, but never got to CFA on say again,

86
00:04:45.370 --> 00:04:49.830
Gordon died in another crash just a few weeks before the end of the war in 1946,

87
00:04:49.850 --> 00:04:52.450
Elizabeth decided that she needed another change of scenery.

88
00:04:52.451 --> 00:04:55.420
So she moved once again, this time to Los Angeles,

89
00:04:55.480 --> 00:04:59.290
she worked as a waitress and lived in a one room apartment behind a nightclub.

90
00:04:59.410 --> 00:05:03.220
It was alleged that she occasionally resulted to prostitution to make ends meet.

91
00:05:03.280 --> 00:05:04.720
So although this was never proven,

92
00:05:04.750 --> 00:05:07.990
it is also commonly asserted that she was hoping to make it big in Hollywood as

93
00:05:07.991 --> 00:05:10.870
an actress, but she had no acting credits to our name.

94
00:05:17.460 --> 00:05:21.180
I had a field day with this case as the entire country became enraptured with

95
00:05:21.181 --> 00:05:24.540
the murder of Elizabeth Short, she was known as the black Dalio.

96
00:05:24.570 --> 00:05:27.720
Although the origins of this famous Monica are a bit murky.

97
00:05:27.900 --> 00:05:31.440
Some say that the newspapers came up with a nickname while others claimed it was

98
00:05:31.530 --> 00:05:34.830
something that our friends called her or the staff at the restaurant where she

99
00:05:34.831 --> 00:05:38.040
works. One journalist specified that the papers popularized the name,

100
00:05:38.041 --> 00:05:41.790
but that the writers had heard it from police officers who originally learned it

101
00:05:41.791 --> 00:05:43.830
from friends and colleagues of Elizabeth Short.

102
00:05:44.100 --> 00:05:47.070
The reasoning behind the nickname is again, a bit iffy.

103
00:05:47.160 --> 00:05:50.550
It referenced a movie that was popular at the time called the blue Dalio,

104
00:05:50.820 --> 00:05:54.630
but changed the color due to Elizabeth Short's dark hair and a penchant for

105
00:05:54.631 --> 00:05:57.560
wearing black lace dresses. It's pretty safe to that's.

106
00:05:57.561 --> 00:06:00.230
If the media had not become so obsessed with this murder,

107
00:06:00.260 --> 00:06:04.640
the case of the black Dahlia would probably not be well remembered today case in

108
00:06:04.900 --> 00:06:08.060
point just a month later, another gruesome killing took place in Los Angeles,

109
00:06:08.061 --> 00:06:12.530
dubbed the lipstick murder this time that naked and severely beaten body of a 44

110
00:06:12.531 --> 00:06:16.640
year old woman named John French was found inside a West LA apartments.

111
00:06:16.670 --> 00:06:18.440
The killer seemingly wrote the words,

112
00:06:19.040 --> 00:06:23.810
you BD on the victims torso with red lipstick and even scientists work

113
00:06:23.870 --> 00:06:25.040
with the name of tax,

114
00:06:25.160 --> 00:06:28.850
the Los Angeles Harold's express rent with the headline where Wolf strikes

115
00:06:28.851 --> 00:06:33.230
again, kills LA women rights BD on body. They concluded that BD,

116
00:06:33.231 --> 00:06:36.830
you could only stand for back daily and that the same killer was responsible for

117
00:06:36.831 --> 00:06:41.180
both crimes. As it turns out, the message actually said PD, which was short,

118
00:06:41.181 --> 00:06:43.040
most likely for police departments,

119
00:06:43.041 --> 00:06:47.210
but it was indicative of how the newspapers were desperate to milk the story of

120
00:06:47.211 --> 00:06:50.450
the black Dahlia. Everything was worth without a doubt.

121
00:06:50.451 --> 00:06:54.350
The most egregious and exploitative example of journalism came courtesy of the

122
00:06:54.351 --> 00:06:55.670
Los Angeles examiner,

123
00:06:55.700 --> 00:07:00.050
who stooped to new lows to get the scoop on Elizabeth Short's early years.

124
00:07:00.080 --> 00:07:03.320
Soon after red Baldy was identified reporters from the examiner called up her

125
00:07:03.321 --> 00:07:06.950
mother before she learns that her daughter had been murdered. Instead,

126
00:07:06.951 --> 00:07:10.340
they told her that Elizabeth had won a beauty contest and we're looking for

127
00:07:10.341 --> 00:07:12.530
background info on her life only afterwards.

128
00:07:12.531 --> 00:07:16.640
Did Mrs. Short find out the horrible truth about what had really happened now,

129
00:07:16.670 --> 00:07:19.550
just before we get into the investigation, let's take a quick break.

130
00:07:19.551 --> 00:07:22.940
So I can tell you about today's sponsor VIN, Sarah watches,

131
00:07:23.150 --> 00:07:27.470
VIN sero creates exceptionally crafted timepieces of fair prices.

132
00:07:28.210 --> 00:07:32.770
They're great looking certainly not minimalists like a lot of watches available

133
00:07:32.771 --> 00:07:33.940
on the market today. No,

134
00:07:33.970 --> 00:07:38.830
they have a bold rather than just sort of blending in

135
00:07:38.831 --> 00:07:41.350
and looking like every other watch out there, right.

136
00:07:41.500 --> 00:07:44.410
Is watch the people will notice. It's a wash that people compliment you on.

137
00:07:44.411 --> 00:07:46.540
Now I've got a couple of them, the one I'm wearing I've actually,

138
00:07:46.541 --> 00:07:48.040
I've got three of them. Don't want I'm wearing them.

139
00:07:48.190 --> 00:07:52.180
The risk right now is the Krono asks. This is a very classic looking watch.

140
00:07:52.210 --> 00:07:54.940
I've got the, uh, silver and blue combination.

141
00:07:55.150 --> 00:07:57.820
A couple of other things I've got is the, uh, the rogue,

142
00:07:57.940 --> 00:08:02.020
which is more of a sports watch style. It's got the rubber strap, it's got the,

143
00:08:02.140 --> 00:08:06.880
uh, folding class like this, and it's a great looking V slightly larger.

144
00:08:07.030 --> 00:08:10.690
So it's a bit larger on the wrist. So if you're a larger wristed gentlemen,

145
00:08:10.720 --> 00:08:14.260
this is perfect for you. I have small watch smaller wrists.

146
00:08:14.290 --> 00:08:18.460
So I tend to smaller watches. There's also this one, this is fantastic.

147
00:08:18.490 --> 00:08:21.100
This is the pilot. Watch their take on a pilot. Watch.

148
00:08:21.101 --> 00:08:24.610
This is called the altitude and it's great.

149
00:08:24.611 --> 00:08:28.960
It's got the red second time ticking behind that. Also a dual time zone,

150
00:08:28.990 --> 00:08:30.880
which is fantastic. If you travel a lot. I mean,

151
00:08:31.090 --> 00:08:33.040
you're probably not doing that right now, but uh,

152
00:08:33.400 --> 00:08:37.750
definitely useful when you do have 18,005 star reviews.

153
00:08:37.810 --> 00:08:41.020
So it's really hard to go wrong. The attention to detail is great.

154
00:08:41.050 --> 00:08:44.320
The price for what you get is great. The feeling on the wrist is great.

155
00:08:44.960 --> 00:08:45.461
Like I say,

156
00:08:45.461 --> 00:08:49.510
the best thing is that they're not forgettable like a lot of minimalist watches

157

165
00:09:16.971 --> 00:09:19.850
named Robert Redman. Lee, who was dating her at the time.

166
00:09:19.940 --> 00:09:23.660
The two had returned from a trip to San Diego on the 8th of January and Manley

167
00:09:23.960 --> 00:09:27.380
dropped her off in front of the Biltmore hotel in Hollywood, the following day,

168
00:09:27.470 --> 00:09:28.303
unsurprisingly,

169
00:09:28.310 --> 00:09:32.420
he was the police's first suspect and was picked up for questioning a few days

170
00:09:32.421 --> 00:09:33.860
after Short's body was found.

171
00:09:33.950 --> 00:09:37.640
Manley had previously been discharged from the army and had been described as

172
00:09:37.641 --> 00:09:40.880
being mentally unstable after suffering multiple nervous breakdowns.

173
00:09:41.030 --> 00:09:43.670
Fortunately for him, he had a solid alibi for the time of the murder.

174
00:09:43.700 --> 00:09:47.540
Plus he also agreed to take a lie detector test on two separate occasions and

175
00:09:47.541 --> 00:09:50.270
passed both of them. Red manly was in the clear,

176
00:09:50.271 --> 00:09:53.450
but the real killer was seemingly none too pleased that somebody else was

177
00:09:53.451 --> 00:09:57.200
getting the attention that he deserved a few days after the murder,

178
00:09:57.201 --> 00:10:00.530
a man proporting to be the killer called the office of the Los Angeles examiner

179
00:10:00.560 --> 00:10:01.580
speaking with the editor,

180
00:10:01.670 --> 00:10:04.490
he expressed his disappointment as to how the case was being presented.

181
00:10:04.790 --> 00:10:08.030
He also claims that he intended to turn himself in eventually,

182
00:10:08.180 --> 00:10:11.630
but wanted to let the police pursue him a bit further. Lastly, the call,

183
00:10:11.631 --> 00:10:15.590
a promise to confirm that he was indeed the real killer by sending some of

184
00:10:15.591 --> 00:10:17.000
Elizabeth Short's belongings.

185
00:10:17.060 --> 00:10:20.060
Clearly he was confident that unless he revealed his identity,

186
00:10:20.360 --> 00:10:23.510
that was no way for the authorities to discover who he was the next day.

187
00:10:23.660 --> 00:10:26.630
An envelope arrived at the newspaper, which contained shorts, birth certificate,

188
00:10:26.810 --> 00:10:28.340
business cards, photographs,

189
00:10:28.341 --> 00:10:31.580
and an address book with the name Mark Hanson written on the cover.

190
00:10:32.060 --> 00:10:35.150
Hansen was a nightclub owner who occasionally allowed Elizabeth to sleep at his

191
00:10:35.151 --> 00:10:37.550
house because she was a close friend of his girlfriends.

192
00:10:37.610 --> 00:10:41.810
He was also one of the last people to speak to short and became a suspect early

193
00:10:41.811 --> 00:10:44.840
in the investigation that same day, the victim's handbag.

194
00:10:44.841 --> 00:10:47.570
And it's one of our shoes were found on top of a trashcan,

195
00:10:47.660 --> 00:10:49.760
a couple of miles from where a body was discovered.

196
00:10:49.820 --> 00:10:51.860
There were no identifying items in the past,

197
00:10:51.861 --> 00:10:55.310
but red manly recognized it as belonging to short for a moment,

198
00:10:55.340 --> 00:10:59.030
it seemed like a pretty big mistake from an otherwise thorough and careful

199
00:10:59.031 --> 00:11:02.270
killer. And police got their hopes up that they could find some fingerprints,

200
00:11:02.960 --> 00:11:06.170
alas. They were not so fortunate. The murderer had been a bit callous,

201
00:11:06.171 --> 00:11:07.310
but not enough,

202
00:11:07.400 --> 00:11:10.190
even though he probably never expected the handbag to be identified.

203
00:11:10.430 --> 00:11:13.100
He still had the forethought to wipe it down with gasoline.

204
00:11:13.220 --> 00:11:16.190
Same thing went for the package that he sent to the examiner.

205
00:11:16.310 --> 00:11:19.580
Speaking of which that sent down to be the first of many communications that the

206
00:11:19.581 --> 00:11:20.030
killer,

207
00:11:20.030 --> 00:11:23.510
or at least someone claiming to be the killer has with the media and the police.

208
00:11:23.660 --> 00:11:26.600
More and more letters started arriving at the offices of the Los Angeles

209
00:11:26.601 --> 00:11:28.460
newspapers covering the blank daily app.

210
00:11:28.640 --> 00:11:32.390
Most of them were pieced together for magazines and newspaper clippings.

211
00:11:32.450 --> 00:11:36.350
I will give up daily a killing. If I get 10 years, don't try to find me.

212
00:11:36.650 --> 00:11:39.980
He never followed up on that offer. So it's unclear if he meant it genuinely,

213
00:11:40.220 --> 00:11:41.720
or if it was just another way to talk.

214
00:11:41.721 --> 00:11:45.650
The police lab tests revealed that these letters all use the same kind of paper

215
00:11:45.651 --> 00:11:49.490
and envelopes as the original package that included Elizabeth Short's

216
00:11:49.491 --> 00:11:50.091
belongings.

217
00:11:50.091 --> 00:11:54.070
So it is generally considered that they came from the killer that seemed changed

218
00:11:54.071 --> 00:11:56.860
as numerous anonymous tips and confessions started pouring in.

219
00:11:56.890 --> 00:11:58.330
Most of them proven to be hoaxes.

220
00:11:58.600 --> 00:12:01.000
Things only got worse off one of the Los Angeles city.

221
00:12:01.450 --> 00:12:04.450
Councilman offered a $10,000 reward for any information on the black daily

222
00:12:04.500 --> 00:12:05.333
killer.

223
00:12:05.430 --> 00:12:09.010
Please tap to sift through 500 tips coming in from people described as an array

224
00:12:09.011 --> 00:12:13.570
of Housewives soldiers, whiners farmers, and clergymen, even decades later,

225
00:12:13.600 --> 00:12:17.260
the LAPD has said that they still receive around half a dozen confessions every

226
00:12:17.261 --> 00:12:17.890
year.

227
00:12:17.890 --> 00:12:21.160
At least some people were a bit more creative with their false confessions.

228
00:12:21.190 --> 00:12:24.700
About a month after the murder police found the scene of an apparent suicide,

229
00:12:25.000 --> 00:12:29.020
a of clothes were found on the beach and inside one of the shoes was a note

230
00:12:29.021 --> 00:12:29.740
which read.

231
00:12:29.740 --> 00:12:32.590
I have waited for the police to capture me for the black daily killing,

232
00:12:32.680 --> 00:12:35.470
but have not. I am too much of a coward to turn myself in.

233
00:12:35.500 --> 00:12:37.150
So this is the best way out for me.

234
00:12:37.300 --> 00:12:39.790
The note was not signed and it's nobody washed ashore that could have

235
00:12:39.791 --> 00:12:40.960
potentially been the office.

236
00:12:41.140 --> 00:12:44.380
Authorities have dismissed this as another grim hoax.

237
00:12:44.470 --> 00:12:48.340
The problem was that despite thousands of man hours, dozens of investigators,

238
00:12:48.341 --> 00:12:49.990
and even FBI assistants,

239
00:12:49.991 --> 00:12:54.850
the LAPD made little headway other than these hoaxes and false confessions,

240
00:12:54.910 --> 00:12:56.410
pretty early in the investigation.

241
00:12:56.440 --> 00:12:59.620
Police became convinced that the killer had some sort of medical training.

242
00:12:59.620 --> 00:13:03.040
So they enlisted the FBI to look at medical and dental students in Southern

243
00:13:03.041 --> 00:13:05.200
California for possible suspects.

244
00:13:05.260 --> 00:13:08.890
This yielded dozens of leads that none good enough for an arrest.

245
00:13:08.920 --> 00:13:11.920
There was also the master of an actual witness. You probably saw the killer.

246
00:13:12.130 --> 00:13:15.880
A man who lived in the area came forward saying that he drove by the empty lot

247
00:13:15.881 --> 00:13:18.460
where Elisabeth's body was found on the night of the murder.

248
00:13:18.520 --> 00:13:21.670
He wanted to throw away some garden clippings, but as he approached the lot,

249
00:13:21.671 --> 00:13:23.620
he saw another man there at around 9:00 PM.

250
00:13:23.890 --> 00:13:27.700
The witness describes the possible killer is middle-aged thin medium height

251
00:13:27.760 --> 00:13:32.020
wearing a tan coat into dark, half driving, a light colored, 1935 sedan.

252
00:13:32.080 --> 00:13:33.310
The neighbor left in his car,

253
00:13:33.311 --> 00:13:36.280
but went once around the block and drove past the lots. Again,

254
00:13:36.520 --> 00:13:39.820
his second arrival startled the other man enough that he went inside his own car

255
00:13:39.821 --> 00:13:43.060
and sped off. Good. This have actually been the black Dahlia killer.

256
00:13:43.270 --> 00:13:46.420
Is it possible that the neighbor interrupted him before he had finished

257
00:13:46.421 --> 00:13:48.700
everything he intended to do to Elizabeth Short?

258
00:13:48.880 --> 00:13:51.340
Unfortunately like most aspects of this case,

259
00:13:51.670 --> 00:13:53.860
these questions can only be answered with speculate.

260
00:14:00.720 --> 00:14:02.100
Two months into the investigation.

261
00:14:02.101 --> 00:14:06.060
The LAPD had around 75 suspects who they considered good enough to screech and

262
00:14:06.061 --> 00:14:08.910
ice. By the time they went to a grand jury, a couple of years later,

263
00:14:08.970 --> 00:14:13.560
they had close to 200 and he gets the only arrests ever made in this case with

264
00:14:13.610 --> 00:14:16.740
obstruction of justice pertaining to false confessions.

265
00:14:17.010 --> 00:14:20.760
As most of you probably already knew when you started watching this video,

266
00:14:20.820 --> 00:14:23.610
the killer of the black Dahlia has never been identified,

267
00:14:23.640 --> 00:14:26.700
but quite a few noteworthy suspects have been put forward.

268
00:14:26.940 --> 00:14:28.260
We already talked about Redman Lee,

269
00:14:28.261 --> 00:14:30.930
but we didn't go into detail regarding Mark Hanson.

270
00:14:30.960 --> 00:14:34.740
The man whose address book was sent to the newspaper along with shorts,

271
00:14:34.741 --> 00:14:38.550
belongings, he was, and actually it still remains a chief suspect,

272
00:14:38.730 --> 00:14:40.930
not necessarily because of his address books,

273
00:14:41.160 --> 00:14:43.350
since he gave that as a gift to Elizabeth Short,

274
00:14:43.730 --> 00:14:47.160
but because he gave contradictory statements while being investigated by

275
00:14:47.161 --> 00:14:47.940
detectives,

276
00:14:47.940 --> 00:14:51.410
further inquiries revealed that Hanson and trying to seduce short while she was

277
00:14:51.411 --> 00:14:54.110
staying at his home, but that she rebuffed his advances.

278
00:14:54.140 --> 00:14:55.910
He was never charged with anything bus.

279
00:14:56.180 --> 00:14:59.780
There were rumors that Hanson used as wealth and connections to law enforcement

280
00:14:59.781 --> 00:15:03.740
to extricate himself from the investigation. So let's move on to Leslie Dillon,

281
00:15:03.741 --> 00:15:08.030
a 27 year old bellhop who inserted himself into the investigation by writing to

282
00:15:08.031 --> 00:15:11.600
discuss the case with LAPD psychiatrist, Dr. Jay pulled a river.

283
00:15:11.720 --> 00:15:14.090
He also used to work as a mortician's assistant.

284
00:15:14.091 --> 00:15:17.840
So he knew how to handle a corpse penis and drain it of blood.

285
00:15:18.260 --> 00:15:19.940
Dylan first wrote to Dr. De river,

286
00:15:19.970 --> 00:15:23.810
asking for info on the case claiming he had an interest in sadists and

287
00:15:23.811 --> 00:15:26.180
psychopaths for a book that he intended to write.

288
00:15:26.480 --> 00:15:29.990
He then expressed his belief that a friend of his name's Jeff Connors was the

289
00:15:29.991 --> 00:15:32.960
man who killed Elizabeth Short during his correspondence.

290
00:15:33.230 --> 00:15:34.850
Dylan showed intimate knowledge of the murder.

291
00:15:34.851 --> 00:15:38.540
And eventually the psychiatrist became convinced that the bellhop was the real

292
00:15:38.541 --> 00:15:40.700
killer and that Jeff Connors was in fact,

293
00:15:40.701 --> 00:15:44.840
a violent extension of his own personality. The LAPD brought Dylan into custody,

294
00:15:44.841 --> 00:15:47.450
but were later surprised when San Francisco police called them.

295
00:15:47.660 --> 00:15:50.930
So let them know that they found Jeff Connors. He was indeed real.

296
00:15:51.140 --> 00:15:54.080
And he worked in Los Angeles at the time of the murder as a handyman for

297
00:15:54.081 --> 00:15:57.140
Columbia studios. However, other than Dylan's opinion,

298
00:15:57.170 --> 00:15:58.910
that was nothing to connect him to the crime.

299
00:15:59.120 --> 00:16:00.620
As far as the bellhop was concerned,

300
00:16:00.650 --> 00:16:04.370
police were eventually forced to move on after finding evidence to suggest that

301
00:16:04.371 --> 00:16:06.770
Dylan May have been in San Francisco at the time of the murder,

302
00:16:07.070 --> 00:16:09.500
but this was never proven conclusively for a while.

303
00:16:09.501 --> 00:16:13.040
Leslie Dillon was the police's main suspect. And even in modern times,

304
00:16:13.041 --> 00:16:17.150
multiple crime buffs writers and former detectives still consider him the black

305
00:16:17.151 --> 00:16:19.520
Dahlia killer. While looking at hundreds of suspects,

306
00:16:19.550 --> 00:16:22.340
police never really lost sight of the medical connection.

307
00:16:22.490 --> 00:16:25.700
They were fairly certain that Elizabeth Short's color had to be someone with

308
00:16:25.730 --> 00:16:28.640
basic medical knowledge to do things that he did to our body.

309
00:16:28.760 --> 00:16:32.720
Whenever a doctor appeared in that cross, as they always paid closer attention,

310
00:16:33.070 --> 00:16:34.280
once such suspect was Patrick.

311
00:16:34.281 --> 00:16:38.330
O'Reilly a doctor who met Sean through Mark Hanson at his nightclub out of

312
00:16:38.331 --> 00:16:41.480
everyone who Riley clearly had the most disturbing violent streak.

313
00:16:41.690 --> 00:16:45.560
As he had previously been convicted for assault with a deadly weapon for taking

314
00:16:45.561 --> 00:16:47.870
his secretary to a motel where he beaten,

315
00:16:47.900 --> 00:16:49.820
tortured her almost to the point of death.

316
00:16:49.970 --> 00:16:54.230
It seems like he had these sadistic proclivities and the medical know-how to

317
00:16:54.260 --> 00:16:58.280
commit to the black Dahlia murder. But the case against him remains an unproven.

318
00:16:58.281 --> 00:17:00.710
One, one small as it usually happens in these cases,

319
00:17:00.711 --> 00:17:04.280
investigators sent to consider the idea that this may not have been the killers

320
00:17:04.850 --> 00:17:06.620
FastMed up, looking back at similar crimes,

321
00:17:06.650 --> 00:17:09.870
one potential candidate jumped out at them. The Cleveland torso matter,

322
00:17:10.100 --> 00:17:14.000
also known as the mad butcher of Kingsbury run this serial killer murdered and

323
00:17:14.001 --> 00:17:16.880
dismembered, at least a dozen people in the late 1930s,

324
00:17:16.910 --> 00:17:20.810
his viciousness equals even surpassed that of the blank daily killer.

325
00:17:20.990 --> 00:17:24.950
So it was natural to consider that they may be the same person even.

326
00:17:24.951 --> 00:17:28.610
So there was never any evidence to connect to the cases other than the violence

327
00:17:28.611 --> 00:17:32.120
of some of the murders. Some of the more Outlander suspects include gangsta,

328
00:17:32.130 --> 00:17:33.140
Bugsy, Siegel, and.

329
00:17:33.560 --> 00:17:35.390
<v 4>AXA Rolson Wells. Many of the people.</v>

330
00:17:35.390 --> 00:17:38.900
<v 0>Who worked at the case always felt deep down in that palms of hearts that they</v>

331
00:17:38.901 --> 00:17:41.690
knew who the killer was, even though they couldn't prove it.

332
00:17:41.780 --> 00:17:45.560
Ralph hostel was the last living detective from the original investigation.

333
00:17:45.590 --> 00:17:47.090
When he died in 2003,

334
00:17:47.120 --> 00:17:51.210
he remained convinced that a man he tracked down and interviewed based on the

335
00:17:51.211 --> 00:17:54.420
testimony you have, the only eyewitness was in fact,

336
00:17:54.421 --> 00:17:57.630
the killer Aggie Underwood's pioneering Los Angeles crime reporter.

337
00:17:57.631 --> 00:17:58.530
And according to her,

338
00:17:58.531 --> 00:18:01.980
the first journalist to arrive at the scene of the black Dalian murder also

339
00:18:01.981 --> 00:18:05.790
believed that she knew the identity of the man who killed Elizabeth Short.

340
00:18:06.000 --> 00:18:07.320
But when pressed for an answer,

341
00:18:07.470 --> 00:18:10.620
she only said that he's dead and it doesn't matter anymore.

342
00:18:10.740 --> 00:18:14.070
So we ended the story with a look at the man who is currently at the top of the

343
00:18:14.071 --> 00:18:17.010
suspect list for many people, George huddle.

344
00:18:17.130 --> 00:18:20.370
He came to the attention of the police in 1949 when he was charged,

345
00:18:20.371 --> 00:18:23.820
but acquitted of sexually assaulting his own daughter. It was a doctor.

346
00:18:23.880 --> 00:18:25.410
So we had the medical knowledge.

347
00:18:25.590 --> 00:18:28.650
He was suspected of involvement in the death of his secretary from a drug

348
00:18:28.680 --> 00:18:32.760
overdose. And he was also interviewed in 1949 in a different killing,

349
00:18:32.940 --> 00:18:36.420
known as the green twig murder. At one point, the police even bugged his home,

350
00:18:36.421 --> 00:18:40.320
but couldn't obtain incriminating evidence. Huddle died in 1999,

351
00:18:40.321 --> 00:18:44.370
but he came back into the spotlight as a prominent suspect courtesy of his son,

352
00:18:44.430 --> 00:18:48.570
Steve huddle is a retired LAPD detective who was become convinced that his

353
00:18:48.571 --> 00:18:51.390
father killed Elizabeth Short all those years ago,

354
00:18:51.480 --> 00:18:52.920
going through his father's belongings,

355
00:18:52.921 --> 00:18:56.010
he found evidence such as personal photographs of a young woman.

356
00:18:56.040 --> 00:19:00.540
He believes to be the aspiring actress as well as letters from his father whose

357
00:19:00.541 --> 00:19:04.410
handwriting matches the letters from the killer sent to newspapers decades ago.

358
00:19:04.500 --> 00:19:08.160
Steve Hodel has spent the last two decades trying to convince others that George

359
00:19:08.161 --> 00:19:10.560
huddle was the man who killed Elizabeth Short.
