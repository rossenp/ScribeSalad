00:00:00.070 --> 00:00:03.240
<v 0>This video is brought to you by Noom. If you have 10 minutes a day,</v>

2
00:00:03.280 --> 00:00:06.440
I want to get serious about better eating habits. It's time to give a Numa,

3
00:00:06.540 --> 00:00:07.920
try more on them in a bit.

4
00:00:13.990 --> 00:00:15.880
It's a story that has become legendary. One.

5
00:00:16.040 --> 00:00:18.280
The day of re American is taught at a young age,

6
00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:21.750
less than a week after the long and bloody civil war or effectively came to an

7
00:00:21.751 --> 00:00:21.930
end.

8
00:00:21.930 --> 00:00:25.510
The man who has become perhaps America's most beloved president Abraham Lincoln,

9
00:00:25.810 --> 00:00:27.470
was shot to death while watching a play.

10
00:00:27.530 --> 00:00:30.630
The man who shot him was not a Confederate soldier or a politician,

11
00:00:30.890 --> 00:00:35.230
but rather an actor who wasn't even from the south yet somehow became enamored

12
00:00:35.231 --> 00:00:38.990
with their cause the group that he assembled hoped to plunge the north into

13
00:00:38.991 --> 00:00:43.180
chaos and revive Southern hope for independence in this, they failed,

14
00:00:43.240 --> 00:00:47.700
but in killing Lincoln, they irrevocably changed the course of American history.

15
00:00:48.060 --> 00:00:52.540
Then the nation is still dealing with the fallout from the assassination today.

16
00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:54.060
<v 1>So who was John Wilkes booth?</v>

17
00:00:54.090 --> 00:00:56.700
What would cause this young man from Mary Lynn who had already built a

18
00:00:56.701 --> 00:01:00.820
prosperous career for himself on the stage to become so devoted to the cause of

19
00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:04.170
Southern nation hood that he would attempt to top all the federal government.

20
00:01:04.270 --> 00:01:07.770
How did he get close enough to Lincoln to shoot him? What happens after he did?

21
00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:10.130
And could his infamous act have been prevented.

22
00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:20.690
<v 0>When ju Brutus booth immigrated to the United States in 1821,</v>

23
00:01:20.691 --> 00:01:22.680
he was already a famous stage at actor in London.

24
00:01:22.900 --> 00:01:26.880
He brought scandal with him to America. He had abandoned his wife and young son,

25
00:01:26.940 --> 00:01:30.120
and instead brought his mistress, Maryanne Holmes with him.

26
00:01:30.260 --> 00:01:33.640
He introduced her to everyone as his wife and the scandal was soon forgotten as

27
00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:37.520
genius booth went on to become America's most famous actor specializing in

28
00:01:37.521 --> 00:01:40.920
Shakespearean tragedies like Richard, the third Julius Caesar and Hamlet,

29
00:01:40.921 --> 00:01:45.310
John Wilkes booth was born on the 10/18/38 at the booth family home in Bella,

30
00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:48.670
Maryland. His father genius was never home, constantly touring.

31
00:01:48.671 --> 00:01:52.390
And when he was his alcoholism and erratic behavior made life difficult for his

32
00:01:52.391 --> 00:01:55.030
large family, he was sent to well regarded boarding schools,

33
00:01:55.250 --> 00:01:58.670
but was an indifferent students much to the chagrin of his instructors.

34
00:01:59.030 --> 00:02:01.950
Ju booth died in 1852 when John was only 14,

35
00:02:02.210 --> 00:02:06.020
he decided afterwards to become an actor himself following in the footsteps of

36
00:02:06.021 --> 00:02:07.340
older brothers, juniors,

37
00:02:07.580 --> 00:02:11.100
junior and Edwin Edwin booth was becoming a household name himself and was able

38
00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:13.180
to help his brother break into the theater.

39
00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:16.260
His first performance was in 1855 in Baltimore.

40
00:02:16.280 --> 00:02:20.340
And after an initial Rocky start of enduring stage fright and forgetting his

41
00:02:20.341 --> 00:02:23.180
lines soon, he settled into a career as an actor.

42
00:02:23.460 --> 00:02:26.810
He became just as famous as his brother and father gaining a reputation for

43
00:02:26.970 --> 00:02:30.170
stealing scenes that he was in and his charisma and good looks made him

44
00:02:30.330 --> 00:02:33.610
enormously popular with the nations young women. By the end of the 1850s,

45
00:02:33.630 --> 00:02:38.250
he was a wealthy man earning over $20,000 a year and over half a million dollars

46
00:02:38.530 --> 00:02:41.770
in today's terms. And he was touring all over the nation as a leading man,

47
00:02:48.230 --> 00:02:51.280
Just as booth was coming into his own as an actor, it seemed the country,

48
00:02:51.560 --> 00:02:55.480
it was on the verge of tearing itself apart the election of Abraham Lincoln in

49
00:02:56.080 --> 00:02:59.640
1860 sparked fears throughout the Southern states that their right to own slaves

50
00:02:59.641 --> 00:03:01.960
would be infringed on by the new administration.

51
00:03:02.150 --> 00:03:06.120
They announced their intention to leave the union to succeed and form their own

52
00:03:06.121 --> 00:03:08.720
nation, which they called the Confederate states of America.

53
00:03:08.721 --> 00:03:12.400
Lincoln held that the Southern states had no right to leave the union and their

54
00:03:12.401 --> 00:03:15.000
state governments were rebelling against federal authority.

55
00:03:15.260 --> 00:03:18.360
And he called for the raising of an army to stop them in April, 1860.

56
00:03:18.510 --> 00:03:20.710
And the first shots of the Americans of a war were fired,

57
00:03:21.110 --> 00:03:22.470
fought sum in South Carolina,

58
00:03:22.540 --> 00:03:25.070
Booth's home state of Maryland found itself in a difficult position.

59
00:03:25.710 --> 00:03:28.670
Maryland was one of the four slave holding states that didn't join the

60
00:03:28.700 --> 00:03:31.190
Confederacy known as border states.

61
00:03:31.190 --> 00:03:34.870
Public opinion among ERs was sharply divided. Even among families.

62
00:03:35.270 --> 00:03:39.180
Edwin booth was a staunch unionist while John Wilkes booth was a passionate for

63
00:03:39.181 --> 00:03:39.920
the Southern course,

64
00:03:39.920 --> 00:03:43.620
the Maryland state government tried to hedge its bets by voting to remain in the

65
00:03:43.621 --> 00:03:44.000
union,

66
00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:47.820
but also to prohibit federal troops from passing through the state or being

67
00:03:47.821 --> 00:03:48.421
based there.

68
00:03:48.421 --> 00:03:52.100
This would've made prosecution of the war impossible for the north and left the

69
00:03:52.101 --> 00:03:55.540
federal capital of Washington DC exposed to Confederate troops across the river

70
00:03:55.541 --> 00:03:57.780
in Virginia Lincoln. Wasn't having it.

71
00:03:57.840 --> 00:04:01.170
He suspended the Riz of habe wars specifically in this case,

72
00:04:01.190 --> 00:04:04.250
the rights to not be imprisoned without trial and jailed,

73
00:04:04.251 --> 00:04:07.250
many Maryland state leaders at Fort McKen and Baltimore Harbor.

74
00:04:07.430 --> 00:04:11.090
He also imposed Marshall law on the city of Baltimore and other parts of the

75
00:04:11.091 --> 00:04:14.650
state and effectively occupied Maryland with federal troops for the duration of

76
00:04:14.651 --> 00:04:17.330
the war. This outraged many pro Southern Marylanders,

77
00:04:17.331 --> 00:04:19.690
including booth who Gordon Lincoln, a tyrant

78
00:04:25.870 --> 00:04:28.960
John Wilkes booths have been involved in politics since 1854,

79
00:04:29.160 --> 00:04:31.760
where he campaigns for the no nothing party,

80
00:04:32.080 --> 00:04:35.680
an early nativist movement whose major campaign planks were anti-Catholic.

81
00:04:36.020 --> 00:04:36.960
And anti-immigrants,

82
00:04:37.100 --> 00:04:41.470
he was a passionate supporter of both the institution of slave aery and of the

83
00:04:41.471 --> 00:04:45.070
Confederacy and spoke to everyone. He knew about his views by contrast,

84
00:04:45.090 --> 00:04:48.510
his brother Edwin refused to tour in the south and spoke out against the

85
00:04:48.511 --> 00:04:51.470
Confederacy. The two brothers argued with each other on the subject.

86
00:04:51.570 --> 00:04:52.630
So viciously this,

87
00:04:52.700 --> 00:04:55.830
they eventually stopped speaking to each other booth had promised his mother

88
00:04:55.860 --> 00:04:58.350
when the war began that he would not enlist as a soldier.

89
00:04:58.530 --> 00:05:02.460
So he continued to tour across both the north and south as a celebrated actor

90
00:05:02.940 --> 00:05:03.080
though,

91
00:05:03.080 --> 00:05:07.060
he increasingly began to paint himself for his decision writing in a letter to

92
00:05:07.061 --> 00:05:11.900
his mother, that he felt like a coward and despised his own existence. In 1864,

93
00:05:11.901 --> 00:05:14.700
the war began to turn badly against the Confederacy in Virginia.

94
00:05:14.701 --> 00:05:17.020
Robert E Lee's army was pinned down in Petersburg,

95
00:05:17.021 --> 00:05:19.860
losing men that it couldn't afford to replace. While in Georgia,

96
00:05:19.861 --> 00:05:23.930
William T Sherman's army had captured the city of Atlanta rent began a campaign

97
00:05:23.931 --> 00:05:25.210
of destruction in the deep south.

98
00:05:25.390 --> 00:05:29.530
It seems increasingly likely that Lincoln would be reelected. And if so,

99
00:05:29.630 --> 00:05:33.290
it was only a matter of time until the so was defeated and slavery was abolished

100
00:05:33.610 --> 00:05:36.890
booth felt increasingly frustrated at his own helplessness to prevent this from

101
00:05:36.891 --> 00:05:41.010
happening and began to channel his rage towards the person of Abraham Lincoln,

102
00:05:41.011 --> 00:05:43.360
himself in a Congress station with his sister Asia,

103
00:05:43.660 --> 00:05:47.080
he said of Lincoln that man's appearance, his pedigree, his course,

104
00:05:47.340 --> 00:05:48.800
low jokes and anecdotes.

105
00:05:48.801 --> 00:05:53.200
His vulgar smiles and his policy are a disgrace to the CT holds.

106
00:05:53.380 --> 00:05:56.280
He has made the tool of the north to crush out slavery.

107
00:05:56.470 --> 00:05:58.400
Something snapped within him.

108
00:05:58.401 --> 00:06:01.480
And he decided that he was gonna do something about it and say,

109
00:06:01.481 --> 00:06:03.720
if you want to do something about your dietary habits,

110
00:06:03.750 --> 00:06:07.800
it's time to talk about today's video sponsor name. I know, look,

111
00:06:07.801 --> 00:06:08.634
it's a new year.

112
00:06:08.660 --> 00:06:11.720
So a lot of you out there probably have health and fitness goals, you know,

113
00:06:12.320 --> 00:06:15.360
lighten up on the late night ice cream or lose 20 pounds by the summer,

114
00:06:15.580 --> 00:06:16.950
you know, usual or staff,

115
00:06:16.970 --> 00:06:20.950
and maybe you're in the market for a high quality weight loss tool that assists

116
00:06:20.951 --> 00:06:21.784
in those goals.

117
00:06:21.850 --> 00:06:25.470
But Noom goes way beyond your typical expectations for a weight loss regimen.

118
00:06:25.660 --> 00:06:29.230
Some programs will make you track your calories or force you to eat their

119
00:06:29.231 --> 00:06:34.030
special meals or do daily maths or shame you for enjoying bad foods.

120
00:06:34.300 --> 00:06:35.990
Noom doesn't do any of that.

121
00:06:36.060 --> 00:06:38.340
Instead it takes more or holistic approach to health,

122
00:06:38.341 --> 00:06:40.420
providing you with the knowledge and counsel.

123
00:06:40.640 --> 00:06:42.980
You need to make good dietary choices.

124
00:06:43.120 --> 00:06:46.020
That's because getting healthy and losing weight are a whole lot easier.

125
00:06:46.440 --> 00:06:51.260
If you know how and why you make the decisions you do when it comes to food and

126
00:06:51.261 --> 00:06:52.220
beyond the health content,

127
00:06:52.221 --> 00:06:54.980

00:07:14.630 --> 00:07:17.090
but if you want to develop real healthy eating habits,

136
00:07:17.091 --> 00:07:20.640
check out our friends at no. There is a link in the description below

137
00:07:26.760 --> 00:07:30.120
Contrary to what many people think booth did not start out intending to

138
00:07:30.320 --> 00:07:33.520
assassinate. The presidency had an even more ambitious plan in mind.

139
00:07:33.580 --> 00:07:36.920
He would kidnap Lincoln and take him to Richmond. Once there,

140
00:07:36.921 --> 00:07:40.150
he would ransom the president back the north in exchange for Confederate

141
00:07:40.151 --> 00:07:42.190
prisoners held in Northern prison camps,

142
00:07:42.191 --> 00:07:46.190
both demoralizing the north and providing the south with desperately needed

143
00:07:46.310 --> 00:07:50.070
manpower to continue the war booth gathered around inmate group of Confederate

144
00:07:50.100 --> 00:07:53.590
sympathizes to help with the kidnapping plot prominence among them were John

145
00:07:53.950 --> 00:07:57.470
Sur, former postmaster and Confederate spy. George ARA,

146
00:07:58.070 --> 00:08:01.260
PR and immigrants who ran a carriage repair business Lewis Powell,

147
00:08:01.380 --> 00:08:05.860
a Confederate army deserter and David Herald pharmacist assistant the

148
00:08:05.861 --> 00:08:09.340
conspirators frequently met at the boarding house owned by John C's mother.

149
00:08:09.490 --> 00:08:13.300
Mary whose level of knowledge of and participation in the conspiracy is still

150
00:08:13.301 --> 00:08:15.580
debated by historians today on March the 17th,

151
00:08:15.780 --> 00:08:20.250
1865 booth assembled his fellow conspirators on the road side of Washington,

152
00:08:20.251 --> 00:08:23.850
anticipating Lincoln passing through there on his way to a function planning to

153
00:08:24.290 --> 00:08:26.930
season and secret him across the Potomac river into Virginia.

154
00:08:27.070 --> 00:08:28.210
But Lincoln never turned up.

155
00:08:28.230 --> 00:08:30.930
It turned out that he had changed his plans at the last minute.

156
00:08:30.950 --> 00:08:34.090
And instead attended a reception at the national hotel in Washington,

157
00:08:34.180 --> 00:08:37.890
ironically, the same hotel that booth himself was staying at a few weeks later,

158
00:08:38.110 --> 00:08:39.730
it seemed all over Richmond's.

159
00:08:39.731 --> 00:08:43.400
The capital of the Confederacy had been captured and after attempting to escape

160
00:08:43.640 --> 00:08:47.400
property, Lee's army was forced to surrender at a bats on April the ninth,

161
00:08:47.460 --> 00:08:51.080
for all intents and purposes, the civil war was over the plot to kid Lincoln,

162
00:08:51.340 --> 00:08:55.480
no longer had any point to it. And boost was despondent and filled with rage.

163
00:08:55.700 --> 00:08:59.360
His thoughts immediately took a darker turn towards assassination.

164
00:09:05.660 --> 00:09:09.880
No one is really sure what booths exact motives were in killing Lincoln.

165
00:09:10.060 --> 00:09:11.720
It is clear that he hated the president,

166
00:09:11.721 --> 00:09:14.440
viewing him as the cause of all the south Smith Forgey,

167
00:09:15.070 --> 00:09:19.750
but did he plot to murder Lincoln based on dedication to the cause of the south?

168
00:09:19.751 --> 00:09:22.710
Perhaps he believed that taking out the head of the federal government would

169
00:09:22.711 --> 00:09:25.870
allow the remnants of the Confederacy to reorganize and fight on.

170
00:09:25.871 --> 00:09:29.550
Since there were still armies in the field or where the motivations were

171
00:09:29.790 --> 00:09:32.590
personal, he could have hoped to make himself a hero to the south.

172
00:09:32.650 --> 00:09:36.540
The man who slew the tire end Rutu kill Julia Caesar.

173
00:09:37.020 --> 00:09:39.620
He could have wanted to do it merely to spite the north,

174
00:09:39.621 --> 00:09:43.100
maybe even despite his Lincoln supporting brother Edwin,

175
00:09:43.200 --> 00:09:45.580
or it could have been a combination of all of them.

176
00:09:45.690 --> 00:09:47.540
What is known is that on the morning of April,

177
00:09:47.541 --> 00:09:51.380
the 14th booth stopped in Ford's theater in Washington to pick up hiss mail

178
00:09:51.560 --> 00:09:55.140
Ford's was a popular theater that had opened two years earlier to replace the

179
00:09:55.141 --> 00:09:58.010
theater, burned down booth himself performed there regularly.

180
00:09:58.110 --> 00:10:01.250
He learns that presidents and Mrs Lincoln were to attend to play there that

181
00:10:01.251 --> 00:10:01.491
night,

182
00:10:01.491 --> 00:10:05.970
accompanied by the commander of the union army UNES S grant and his wife booth

183
00:10:05.971 --> 00:10:07.250
decided immediately,

184
00:10:07.251 --> 00:10:11.730
this was a perfect time and place to kill both the presidents and the general.

185
00:10:11.990 --> 00:10:12.930
If he could manage it,

186
00:10:12.980 --> 00:10:15.650
booth gathered together his conspirators to lay out his plan.

187
00:10:15.890 --> 00:10:19.200
Lou Powell was murdered to the secretary of state William seaward at his home.

188
00:10:19.340 --> 00:10:22.400
George Azara would go to the hotel where vice president,

189
00:10:22.401 --> 00:10:26.320
Andrew Johnson was staying and assassinate him and booth would slip into the

190
00:10:26.321 --> 00:10:29.560
presidential box at Ford's theater during the play shoot Lincoln,

191
00:10:29.561 --> 00:10:31.920
with the single shot Derringer pistol he had,

192
00:10:32.280 --> 00:10:35.680
and then stab grant with a dagger that he would also be carrying booth,

193
00:10:35.920 --> 00:10:36.750
probably assumed the,

194
00:10:36.750 --> 00:10:39.990
the presidential box would be guarded and thought he could talk his way into an

195
00:10:40.150 --> 00:10:43.230
audience with Lincoln by leveraging his famous an actor for his part,

196
00:10:43.231 --> 00:10:47.030
Lincoln was a fan of Booth's performances and sent invitations to meet him at

197
00:10:47.031 --> 00:10:50.350
the white house. Several times in the past that booth had turned down.

198
00:10:50.670 --> 00:10:51.630
It seems amazing to us now,

199
00:10:51.730 --> 00:10:55.710
but in 1865 security precautions for the presidents were almost nonexistence.

200
00:10:55.890 --> 00:10:59.620
The secret service yet exist, and it wouldn't be until 1902,

201
00:10:59.730 --> 00:11:02.540
that they were assigned the duty of protecting the president's life.

202
00:11:02.640 --> 00:11:06.620
The white house was open to practically anyone who wanted to petition the

203
00:11:06.621 --> 00:11:09.660
presidents and even in the middle of a civil war. Lincoln had few,

204
00:11:09.920 --> 00:11:12.420
if anybody arms around him, when he went anywhere,

205
00:11:12.780 --> 00:11:15.860
palace guards were thought to be the province of European monarchs,

206
00:11:15.861 --> 00:11:17.180
not elected servants of the people.

207
00:11:17.640 --> 00:11:21.170
Thus on the night that Lincoln went to the theater, he had only one bodyguard,

208
00:11:21.330 --> 00:11:23.810
a police officer named John Frederick Parker,

209
00:11:30.000 --> 00:11:33.210
General grants, and his wife decided not to go with Lincoln to the play.

210
00:11:33.211 --> 00:11:35.690
Instead traveling to Philadelphia to spend time with their children.

211
00:11:35.830 --> 00:11:40.200
It has been widely reported that Mary Todd and Julia Grant didn't like each

212
00:11:40.201 --> 00:11:43.000
other. And that was why the grants didn't go. Whatever the case,

213
00:11:43.001 --> 00:11:46.720
the decision likely saved the future president's life president and Mrs Lincoln

214
00:11:46.820 --> 00:11:50.640
and their guests major Henry Roth bone and his fiance arrived at the theater

215
00:11:50.710 --> 00:11:54.000
late situating themselves in the presidential box with John Frederick Parker

216
00:11:54.040 --> 00:11:57.920
guarding the door. The play was stopped as the audience of 1,700,

217
00:11:58.120 --> 00:12:02.360
a full house gave a standing ovation and the orchestra played held to the chief.

218
00:12:02.540 --> 00:12:06.040
The play was a popular comedy. Our American cousin that booth knew by heart.

219
00:12:06.180 --> 00:12:09.520
The plan was for all three would be assassins to strike at the same time,

220
00:12:10.020 --> 00:12:13.870
10:00 PM while he waited booth stopped in next or at the star saloon taking a

221
00:12:13.871 --> 00:12:16.950
drink of whiskey perhaps to calm his nerves around 10 15,

222
00:12:16.951 --> 00:12:18.470
the play was in the middle of its third act.

223
00:12:18.470 --> 00:12:22.190
Lincoln had been seen to be enjoying the play and nobody was paying attention to

224
00:12:22.191 --> 00:12:25.510
what was happening behind the presidential box booth had gone into the theater

225
00:12:25.690 --> 00:12:28.630
and up the stairs and found nobody outside the door to the presidential box.

226
00:12:28.810 --> 00:12:31.950
The policeman John F. Parker had left during the intermission to go drinking.

227
00:12:32.090 --> 00:12:32.950
And wasn't it. A,

228
00:12:33.220 --> 00:12:36.740
his post booth went into the small laundry room that separated the box from the

229
00:12:36.741 --> 00:12:38.540
hallway and bared the door behind him.

230
00:12:38.880 --> 00:12:41.300
Now only one door separated him from the presidents.

231
00:12:41.320 --> 00:12:42.700
He looked through a peephole in the door,

232
00:12:42.701 --> 00:12:46.140
ultimately described as being cut by booth himself or by the owner of the

233
00:12:46.141 --> 00:12:49.220
theater sometime earlier for an unrelated purpose and waited.

234
00:12:49.320 --> 00:12:52.180
He knew from experience that the line in the play that caused the biggest

235
00:12:52.500 --> 00:12:56.250
audience reaction was coming up and he would strike. Then on stage the actor,

236
00:12:56.251 --> 00:12:57.410
Harry Hawk said the line,

237
00:12:57.411 --> 00:13:00.930
the booth was waiting for don't know the man as of good society. Eh, well,

238
00:13:01.090 --> 00:13:05.210
I guess I know enough to turn you inside out on gal. You sock.

239
00:13:05.930 --> 00:13:08.850
Dollarizing old man trap as the whole audience, including president Lincoln,

240
00:13:09.250 --> 00:13:10.770
laugh booth opened the door to the box,

241
00:13:11.290 --> 00:13:14.880
aimed as pistol at the back of Lincoln's head and fired from point blank range.

242
00:13:15.100 --> 00:13:16.720
The president slumped forward in his chair,

243
00:13:17.080 --> 00:13:20.960
major Rathburn lept to his feet and made to grab booth who dropped his gun and

244
00:13:20.961 --> 00:13:23.560
pulled out his dagger slicing open Rath bone's arm,

245
00:13:23.561 --> 00:13:26.840
almost the bone Unter Rath bone grabbed again. Booth's coat.

246
00:13:27.080 --> 00:13:29.960
As the assassin attempted to jump from the box to the stage.

247
00:13:30.060 --> 00:13:33.320
12 feet below booth had to twist away from Rath bone and in the process,

248
00:13:33.840 --> 00:13:37.470
his spur at caught on the buns draped over the front of the presidential box.

249
00:13:37.690 --> 00:13:40.390
He awkwardly fell to the stage, breaking his leg,

250
00:13:40.790 --> 00:13:42.350
probably running high on adrenaline booth,

251
00:13:42.460 --> 00:13:45.270
ignored the pain and with an actor's flare for the dramatic,

252
00:13:45.500 --> 00:13:50.190
held his bloody knife up to the audience and yelled sick Tyran, which is Latin.

253
00:13:50.630 --> 00:13:54.510
The thus always Tyrons. It's also the state motto at Virginia.

254
00:13:54.910 --> 00:13:58.220
Some witnesses also reportedly heard the south is avenged.

255
00:13:58.660 --> 00:14:00.740
Then he limped behind the stage, out the back door,

256
00:14:00.810 --> 00:14:04.580
stabbed someone that tried to stop him, mounted his horse and Gallup away.

257
00:14:10.810 --> 00:14:13.900
Many in the audience initially thought the booth was part of the plane until the

258
00:14:13.901 --> 00:14:17.610
first lady screams just as booth was fleeing the scene as word spread that the

259
00:14:17.611 --> 00:14:20.050
president had been shot. The city of Washington fell into chaos.

260
00:14:20.190 --> 00:14:21.290
Things got even worse.

261
00:14:21.291 --> 00:14:23.890
When reports that secretary Seawood had been attacked as well,

262
00:14:23.891 --> 00:14:27.570
came in Louis Powell had arrived at sea's house in Lafayette park around the

263
00:14:27.571 --> 00:14:29.610
same time as booth was entering forts theater.

264
00:14:29.710 --> 00:14:31.170
He bluffed his way past the doorman,

265
00:14:31.171 --> 00:14:33.730
but not one of Seawood sons who tried to intercept him.

266
00:14:33.731 --> 00:14:35.810
Powell pulled a gun on him, but the gun misfired.

267
00:14:35.811 --> 00:14:37.880
So how bludgeoned him unconscious with the,

268
00:14:37.881 --> 00:14:40.640
but then he ran into the secretary of state's bedroom, Widing,

269
00:14:40.641 --> 00:14:42.760
a large Bowie knife Seawood was in bed,

270
00:14:42.761 --> 00:14:44.720
recovering from a carriage accident 10 days earlier,

271
00:14:44.721 --> 00:14:48.160
which had left him with a broken drawer in arm power slash repeatedly at the

272
00:14:48.320 --> 00:14:49.760
secretary's face and neck with a knife.

273
00:14:49.860 --> 00:14:53.400
But the splints that the doctor had fixed onto sea what's head to hold his

274
00:14:53.401 --> 00:14:55.320
broken drawer in place, saved his life,

275
00:14:55.321 --> 00:14:58.680
preventing Powell from slicing his jugular vein. Another of Seawood sons,

276
00:14:58.700 --> 00:15:01.280
his daughter, and a soldier who served as an attendant,

277
00:15:01.281 --> 00:15:05.680
struggled with the attacker and were stabbed in turn before Powell ran outta the

278
00:15:05.681 --> 00:15:08.800
house, cackling and screaming. I'm mad, I'm mad.

279
00:15:09.140 --> 00:15:11.830
He stabbed another pass by before escaping everyone,

280
00:15:11.831 --> 00:15:13.630
Powell attacked would eventually recover.

281
00:15:13.830 --> 00:15:17.190
Although William seaward would carry the scars from the attack on his face for

282
00:15:17.191 --> 00:15:18.670
the rest of his life. As for George,

283
00:15:19.270 --> 00:15:21.710
Anati never even tried to assassinate vice president Johnson.

284
00:15:21.850 --> 00:15:23.830
He made it to the hotel where Johnson was staying,

285
00:15:23.890 --> 00:15:26.070
but lost his nerve and got drunk at the bar.

286
00:15:26.071 --> 00:15:29.550
Instead wandering around the streets of Washington before disposing of his knife

287
00:15:29.670 --> 00:15:30.231
in a storm drain.

288
00:15:30.231 --> 00:15:34.180
Lincoln was carried from the theater across the street to the home of William

289
00:15:34.180 --> 00:15:36.700
Peterson, where he was attended to by brigade of doctors,

290
00:15:36.701 --> 00:15:39.420
including the surgeon general, but there was nothing they could do.

291
00:15:39.560 --> 00:15:41.820
It is likely that even today with modern medicine,

292
00:15:41.880 --> 00:15:42.900
the wound would've been mortal,

293
00:15:43.130 --> 00:15:46.220
Abraham Lincoln died at 7:22 AM on April the 15th,

294
00:15:46.460 --> 00:15:48.020
surrounded by much of his cabinet.

295
00:15:48.280 --> 00:15:51.300
The news spread quickly across the country causing an outpouring of grief.

296
00:15:51.720 --> 00:15:55.450
Vice president Johnson was sworn in as president of the United States at 11:00

297
00:15:55.450 --> 00:15:55.451
AM,

298
00:15:55.451 --> 00:15:59.250
but the reigns of government were now in the hands of the secretary of war Edwin

299
00:15:59.450 --> 00:16:02.410
Stanton. He began the investigation into the plot before Lincoln had died,

300
00:16:02.411 --> 00:16:05.010
essentially running the government from Peterson house.

301
00:16:05.200 --> 00:16:08.810
John Wilkes booth was quickly fingered as the assassin by multiple witnesses in

302
00:16:08.811 --> 00:16:11.330
the theater. And he became the most wanted man in America.

303
00:16:18.080 --> 00:16:21.520
Lisa bluffed his way out of Washington before the city was put into lockdown and

304
00:16:21.521 --> 00:16:24.560
escaped into Southern Maryland. Along with his accomplished David Herald,

305
00:16:24.740 --> 00:16:28.240
he hopes that the relatively rural area full of Confederate sympathizers would

306
00:16:28.241 --> 00:16:30.560
be the perfect place to hide out while slipping into Virginia,

307
00:16:30.690 --> 00:16:32.790
where he expected to be phased as a hero.

308
00:16:32.970 --> 00:16:36.150
He and Harolds picked up guns and supplies from Mary threats,

309
00:16:36.151 --> 00:16:37.150
Tavan outside the city,

310
00:16:37.170 --> 00:16:41.110
and then stopped at the home of Dr. Samuel Mar an acquaintance of booths who set

311
00:16:41.170 --> 00:16:43.190
his broken leg and gave him place to sleep.

312
00:16:43.590 --> 00:16:46.790
Mud would later be arrested and sentenced to prison for assisting booths though.

313
00:16:46.791 --> 00:16:50.070
His role in the conspiracy like Mary Sur is hotly debated booth,

314
00:16:50.270 --> 00:16:54.140
and TAs then went to grounds hiding in the swamps on the VIG in Maryland border.

315
00:16:54.360 --> 00:16:57.900
It was there. The booth seemed to grasp the magnitude of what he had done.

316
00:16:58.000 --> 00:17:00.820
He was being given newspapers by a man named Thomas Jones,

317
00:17:01.060 --> 00:17:02.860
a Confederate spy who lived in the area.

318
00:17:03.080 --> 00:17:07.380
And that was how he learned that Stanton had put a $50,000 bouncy on his head.

319
00:17:07.550 --> 00:17:08.383
Staggering.

320
00:17:08.420 --> 00:17:11.460
Some of the time he also learns that most of his co-conspirators had been

321
00:17:11.620 --> 00:17:15.210
arrested already, including AUM Al and by April the 21st,

322
00:17:15.211 --> 00:17:16.650
the only conspirators still at large,

323
00:17:16.930 --> 00:17:21.130
where booth himself Herald still with booth and John Sur who had escaped across

324
00:17:21.131 --> 00:17:25.370
the board to Canada. And then to Europe, he wouldn't be arrested until November,

325
00:17:25.370 --> 00:17:27.890
1866 worse were booth. He saw that the reaction to his act,

326
00:17:27.950 --> 00:17:30.810
wasn't all that he hoped for far from considering him as Tys.

327
00:17:30.811 --> 00:17:33.730
Almost everyone in the north was shocked de polled at Lincoln's murder,

328
00:17:33.731 --> 00:17:38.000
even as theist critics and many people in the south were similarly unimpressed

329
00:17:38.001 --> 00:17:39.240
with booths act though,

330
00:17:39.241 --> 00:17:42.880
some of that may be chalked up to self-preservation many in the south fears that

331
00:17:42.980 --> 00:17:46.560
an angry Northern population would exact revenge on the south for Lincoln's

332
00:17:46.561 --> 00:17:46.720
death.

333
00:17:46.720 --> 00:17:50.520
Federal troops were scouring Southern Marylands for the assassin and with no

334
00:17:50.521 --> 00:17:52.360
heroes. Welcome to look forward to booth,

335
00:17:52.361 --> 00:17:55.120
decided to cross into Virginia and continue south,

336
00:17:55.121 --> 00:17:56.320
perhaps all the way to Mexico,

337
00:17:56.500 --> 00:17:59.200
to escape federal authorities after getting lost along the way,

338
00:17:59.201 --> 00:18:02.000
booth and Herald made it to Virginia. On April the 23rd,

339
00:18:02.150 --> 00:18:06.320
they arrived at farm owns by Richard Garrett family that didn't know yet that

340
00:18:06.321 --> 00:18:09.310
Lincoln had been assassinated or that booth was a huge Whil worth.

341
00:18:09.510 --> 00:18:12.990
Got back to Washington about booths movements and a detachment of soldiers led

342
00:18:13.010 --> 00:18:15.150
by Lieutenant Colonel. Evan Conns,

343
00:18:15.151 --> 00:18:18.350
Lieutenant Edward dirty was sent to find booth and capture him

344
00:18:24.950 --> 00:18:28.190
Congar and dirty tracked booth to the Garrett farmhouse and surrounded the

345
00:18:28.191 --> 00:18:31.700
tobacco bar. They were hiding in shortly before Dawn on April the 26th,

346
00:18:31.830 --> 00:18:33.500
David Herald quickly surrendered,

347
00:18:33.501 --> 00:18:38.060
but booth refused saying that he'd prefer to come out and fight in an attempt to

348
00:18:38.300 --> 00:18:39.860
spare him out. The soldiers set far to the barn.

349
00:18:39.861 --> 00:18:43.220
There are conflicting accountants about what happened next. One of the soldiers,

350
00:18:43.300 --> 00:18:46.620
Sergeant Boston Cort drew a beat on booth through a crack in the wall at the

351
00:18:46.820 --> 00:18:47.580
barn.

352
00:18:47.580 --> 00:18:50.610
Corbit said that booth raised his gun to shoot cor orbit upon which Corbert

353
00:18:50.850 --> 00:18:54.130
fired others alleged that Cobert fired on an unarmed booth out of a sense of

354
00:18:54.250 --> 00:18:56.570
vengeance, but no one will ever know for sure.

355
00:18:56.630 --> 00:18:59.770
The bullet struck booth in the neck severing his spinal column and damaging

356
00:19:00.020 --> 00:19:00.970
three vertebrae.

357
00:19:01.150 --> 00:19:04.410
He collapsed to the grounds paralyzed and was dragged outta the barn by

358
00:19:04.411 --> 00:19:04.860
soldiers.

359
00:19:04.860 --> 00:19:08.530
Booth was unable to move and in excruciating pain over the course of next two

360
00:19:08.531 --> 00:19:11.040
hours, he begged the soldiers kill him. At one point,

361
00:19:11.060 --> 00:19:14.760
he asked one of the soldiers to pull up his hand so that he could see them.

362
00:19:14.900 --> 00:19:19.600
The soldier complied and booth looked at them, mattering, useless, useless.

363
00:19:19.870 --> 00:19:22.280
They were his last words. Soon after he died,

364
00:19:22.580 --> 00:19:24.600
two weeks shy of his 27th birthday,

365
00:19:25.160 --> 00:19:29.040
Edwin Stan had wanted booth taken alive and initially planned to core martial

366
00:19:29.520 --> 00:19:32.190
Boston Corbert for killing a him, but the case was dismissed.

367
00:19:32.191 --> 00:19:35.710
And Corbit went on to be known as Lincoln's Avenger by the public.

368
00:19:36.010 --> 00:19:39.190
The other conspirators were tried by military tribunal. Soon afterwards,

369
00:19:39.340 --> 00:19:41.590
four of them, George Arod Lewis Powell, David,

370
00:19:41.910 --> 00:19:45.750
her and Mary Surat were sentenced to death and were hanged on July. The seventh,

371
00:19:45.940 --> 00:19:48.390
four more were sentenced to prison terms. One died in prison,

372
00:19:48.410 --> 00:19:51.620
but the other three were pardoned by president Johnson short before he left

373
00:19:51.621 --> 00:19:55.260
office in 1869. John Surat was never convicted of his role in the plot.

374
00:19:55.460 --> 00:19:58.220
And many believed that his mother had been hanged in his place.

375
00:19:58.440 --> 00:20:01.820
The consequences of Abraham Lincoln's death had a profound effect on American

376
00:20:01.821 --> 00:20:04.700
history. It deprived the country of their leader, right?

377
00:20:04.730 --> 00:20:08.580
When they needed him the most to help heal the nation and bind it back together.

378
00:20:08.640 --> 00:20:09.473
Andrew Johnson,

379
00:20:09.700 --> 00:20:13.490
a unionist southerner at no interest in making sure the slaves freed during the

380
00:20:13.491 --> 00:20:15.770
war were set up for success in the postwar south.

381
00:20:15.830 --> 00:20:19.850
His primary interest was in getting the troops out of the former Confederacy as

382
00:20:19.851 --> 00:20:24.010
soon as possible and restoring order meaning controlled by the antebellum white

383
00:20:24.011 --> 00:20:27.090
politicians that had plunged the country into conflict in the first place,

384
00:20:27.530 --> 00:20:30.450
it would set him against Congress and most of his own cabinet.

385
00:20:30.590 --> 00:20:32.600
And he became the first president impeached.

386
00:20:32.700 --> 00:20:37.360
He was suddenly saved from being removed from office by a single vote without

387
00:20:37.361 --> 00:20:40.840
Lincoln support for Reed slaves eventually dried up and by 1876,

388
00:20:40.841 --> 00:20:42.880
when the last of the federal troops withdrawn,

389
00:20:43.020 --> 00:20:46.520
the former Confederate states had enacted so-called Jim Crow laws that

390
00:20:46.720 --> 00:20:50.760
segregated black citizens and made it almost impossible for them to exercise any

391
00:20:50.761 --> 00:20:54.480
of their civil rights while it is impossible to say how things would've been

392
00:20:54.481 --> 00:20:55.960
different. If Lincoln had lived,

393
00:20:56.180 --> 00:20:58.640
it is certain that they would've been different.

394
00:20:58.860 --> 00:21:01.360
And in all likelihood would've been better for everyone,

395
00:21:01.700 --> 00:21:04.560
but especially African Americans as with John Wilkes booth,

396
00:21:04.880 --> 00:21:09.830
his name as is the fate of many assassins is irrevocably tied to that

397
00:21:10.010 --> 00:21:13.190
of the great Manny SL what sets booth apart from people like Lee,

398
00:21:13.191 --> 00:21:15.070
Harvey Oswold or James Earl Ray,

399
00:21:15.450 --> 00:21:19.990
is that they were driven in no small parts by the compulsion to become famous by

400
00:21:19.991 --> 00:21:23.950
killing a famous person. Booth was already famous before assassinating Lincoln,

401
00:21:24.080 --> 00:21:26.830
which makes it all the more strange that he would do it.

402
00:21:27.160 --> 00:21:31.060
We must accept however that it was his fanatical devotion to the cause of the

403
00:21:31.061 --> 00:21:34.700
Confederacy and to the preservation of slavery that led him away from the

404
00:21:34.701 --> 00:21:38.660
comfortable path laid in front of him and down the dark road that tended with

405
00:21:38.661 --> 00:21:43.220
the deaths of both himself and the presidents that were so beloved by many yet

406
00:21:43.221 --> 00:21:44.054
hated by him.

407
00:21:44.080 --> 00:21:47.850
It also seems obvious that if a modicum of protection had been in place booth

408
00:21:47.851 --> 00:21:51.770
would not have been able to access the presidential box that night armed as he

409
00:21:51.790 --> 00:21:55.570
was, and history would've been much different, but he did.

410
00:21:55.910 --> 00:21:59.890
And that is why we considered John Wilkes booth America's most infamous

411
00:22:00.250 --> 00:22:02.530
assassin. So I really hope you found that video. Interesting. If you did,
