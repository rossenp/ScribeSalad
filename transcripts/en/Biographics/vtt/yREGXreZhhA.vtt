00:00:26.660 --> 00:00:29.330
This is the nightmare I live with.

9
00:00:29.690 --> 00:00:33.260
This is how today's protagonist describes the haunting memories of his

10
00:00:33.261 --> 00:00:36.530
experience at the Auschwitz Birkenau extermination camp,

11
00:00:36.710 --> 00:00:40.910
50 years after the events of world war two. But this man was a doctor,

12
00:00:40.970 --> 00:00:44.720
not a Gordon's prisoner or heroin survivor. He was in fact,

13
00:00:44.870 --> 00:00:46.400
an SS medical officer,

14
00:00:46.430 --> 00:00:50.390
one of the many Nazi doctors who worked within the industry of death,

15
00:00:50.391 --> 00:00:53.510
that the concentration camps served as the backbone of,

16
00:00:53.810 --> 00:00:56.390
but unlike many of his more infamous peers,

17
00:00:56.420 --> 00:00:59.030
this man went down in history as a good doctor,

18
00:00:59.390 --> 00:01:03.980
a good man who did his best to save human lives or at minimum to

19
00:01:03.981 --> 00:01:07.490
preserve a sliver of dignity for the camps prisoners,

20
00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:12.350
his name was Hansville how much also known as the good man of Auschwitz.

21
00:01:19.370 --> 00:01:20.930
She was born on may the 14th,

22
00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:24.500
1911 in Freiburg in Bryce gal Barden,

23
00:01:24.530 --> 00:01:26.660
then Barnes of the second German Reich.

24
00:01:26.870 --> 00:01:31.820
His parents were Ernst and Matilda Nissan. Hung's inherited from Ernst,

25
00:01:31.821 --> 00:01:34.790
an interest in science. And after graduating from high school,

26
00:01:34.940 --> 00:01:38.870
he took up medicine, studying universities of Munich and tubing.

27
00:01:39.170 --> 00:01:40.220
Again in 1933,

28
00:01:40.221 --> 00:01:43.670
Hitler and the Nazi party were empowered and to gradually exerting influence

29
00:01:43.671 --> 00:01:47.660
over every aspect of life. As the hands progressed in his medical studies,

30
00:01:47.661 --> 00:01:51.470
he considered gaining formal party membership as a prerequisite to have,

31
00:01:51.710 --> 00:01:54.200
and to keep any future job in later interviews,

32
00:01:54.660 --> 00:01:57.740
Huntsman stated that he tolerated Nazi ideology,

33
00:01:57.741 --> 00:01:59.390
but never actively supported it.

34
00:01:59.570 --> 00:02:03.800
He was somewhat enthused by the patriotic rhetoric and he recognized that the

35
00:02:03.801 --> 00:02:07.400
German economy as well for of the middle class had improved since the Nazis took

36
00:02:07.401 --> 00:02:11.780
power. His family was even less enthusiastic about national socialism.

37
00:02:11.780 --> 00:02:15.530
His father Ernst was completely indifferent while mum Matilda was strongly

38
00:02:15.531 --> 00:02:18.800
opposed as per the antisemitic stance of the party. Well,

39
00:02:18.801 --> 00:02:23.300
the entire family detested it wholeheartedly, but to Hans his own admission,

40
00:02:23.540 --> 00:02:26.120
they never took it seriously. So the future Dr. Munch,

41
00:02:26.150 --> 00:02:29.810
the antisemitic propaganda was this a more than empty words and bombast.

42
00:02:30.020 --> 00:02:33.860
He could never believe that the Nazis would actually take violent systematic

43
00:02:33.861 --> 00:02:35.630
actions against German Jews.

44
00:02:35.930 --> 00:02:40.160
But these reasons in 1934 horns joins without much conviction to Nazi youth

45
00:02:40.161 --> 00:02:41.060
organizations,

46
00:02:41.061 --> 00:02:45.620
the national socialists mechanized core and the national socialist union of

47
00:02:45.621 --> 00:02:48.230
students. It wasn't until may of 1937,

48
00:02:48.350 --> 00:02:51.380
that Hans became a card carrying member of the Nazi party.

49
00:02:51.590 --> 00:02:55.970
And even then it's happened almost by chance. As Hans completed his studies,

50
00:02:55.971 --> 00:03:00.010
he entered a scientific competition to find a local alternative to Gar and

51
00:03:00.190 --> 00:03:02.560
imported substance derived from red algae.

52
00:03:02.660 --> 00:03:06.880
At the time it was used in labs as a culture, medium to study bacteria.

53
00:03:07.090 --> 00:03:09.640
How does one? The competition has entry into the contest.

54
00:03:09.641 --> 00:03:13.720
A few lines describing the new substance was accepted as a dissertation thesis.

55
00:03:13.900 --> 00:03:17.770
Moreover, he received further praise and recognition from the party itself while

56
00:03:17.771 --> 00:03:19.360
completing his medical internship.

57
00:03:19.390 --> 00:03:22.990
He was given a leadership position in a bacteriological department,

58
00:03:23.020 --> 00:03:25.840
supervising scientific teams producing the new culture.

59
00:03:25.841 --> 00:03:30.520
Medium in exchange though, have to join the Nazi party as much later declared.

60
00:03:30.700 --> 00:03:32.080
He had run out of reasons.

61
00:03:39.630 --> 00:03:41.010
Well, the first 1939,

62
00:03:41.011 --> 00:03:44.970
the long dark night of Europe began as German troops crossed the border.

63
00:03:45.060 --> 00:03:48.690
And deponents many doctors have been drafted into the armed forces,

64
00:03:48.750 --> 00:03:52.770
but as Hans became Dr. Munch, he was labeled indispensable.

65
00:03:52.771 --> 00:03:54.150
He was not drafted.

66
00:03:54.151 --> 00:03:57.210
And his military authorities asked him to stay in Germany to replace other

67
00:03:57.211 --> 00:04:00.600
physicians who had been sent to the fronts during the early months of world war

68
00:04:00.840 --> 00:04:00.870
two,

69
00:04:00.870 --> 00:04:05.760
Dr. Munch was in a small countryside hospital in Bavaria acting as a replacement

70
00:04:05.761 --> 00:04:08.730
for an absent medical officer while stationed there. He met NS,

71
00:04:08.740 --> 00:04:13.020
married his wife, also a fellow doctor against our wishes in 19, 1941.

72
00:04:13.560 --> 00:04:17.910
Huns volunteered to join the armed forces as motivation and patriotism,

73
00:04:17.940 --> 00:04:20.040
as well as feelings of guilt. He,

74
00:04:20.100 --> 00:04:24.330
a young man had a comfortable position in the countryside hospital while older

75
00:04:24.331 --> 00:04:27.840
doctors were dying on the front line. Hums were still indispensable though.

76
00:04:27.960 --> 00:04:29.400
And his application was rejected.

77
00:04:29.610 --> 00:04:33.120
He then tried to seek help from his sister secretary at the office of the

78
00:04:33.121 --> 00:04:33.954
general staff.

79
00:04:33.960 --> 00:04:37.650
She arranged a series of meetings with various offices and ministry officials,

80
00:04:37.680 --> 00:04:39.060
but with literal results,

81
00:04:39.120 --> 00:04:43.110
Dr. Munch remains stuck in Bavaria until one day in new neck.

82
00:04:43.230 --> 00:04:44.580
He ran into an old school friends.

83
00:04:44.760 --> 00:04:48.390
Dr. Strasburg Strasburg had told Hans that he was doing well. This,

84
00:04:48.540 --> 00:04:52.350
he had secured a non-specified job with the government when Mudge told him about

85
00:04:52.351 --> 00:04:53.850
his difficulty in joining the military,

86
00:04:53.851 --> 00:04:57.670
the old friend advised that he volunteered for the orphan SS rather than,

87
00:04:57.780 --> 00:05:02.340
than regular army Strausberg was an SS officer himself and was actually part of

88
00:05:02.341 --> 00:05:04.290
the staff of Reinhardt Heidrick.

89
00:05:04.320 --> 00:05:08.820
The SNS second in command munch was delighted about the encounter that the

90
00:05:08.821 --> 00:05:11.820
Waffen SS, the fighting units of the organization,

91
00:05:11.850 --> 00:05:15.390
joining them would mean helping fellow troops at the fronts. In other words,

92
00:05:15.391 --> 00:05:18.330
he could fulfill his duty as a patriotic German at that time,

93
00:05:18.360 --> 00:05:19.380
he did not suspect.

94
00:05:19.381 --> 00:05:24.000
So at least he claimed he did not suspect the orphan SS could be also

95
00:05:24.001 --> 00:05:27.300
involved in the administration of the concentration camps.

96
00:05:27.360 --> 00:05:31.890
Moreover munch had little knowledge of the camps or again, so he claimed,

97
00:05:31.980 --> 00:05:35.520
he admitted that he knew about Dachau and other camps in Northern Germany,

98
00:05:35.521 --> 00:05:40.170
but he was allegedly unaware of the extent of the atrocities being perpetrated

99
00:05:40.200 --> 00:05:41.780
when his application was accepted.

100
00:05:41.880 --> 00:05:46.500
And Mudge was told that he would initially be posted near Krakow in Poland after

101
00:05:46.501 --> 00:05:50.910
completing his SS officer training in June of 1943, the Nazis kept that promise,

102
00:05:51.120 --> 00:05:55.860
Dr. Hans munch was posted to the hygiene Institute of the Waffen SS.

103
00:05:56.040 --> 00:05:57.920
And RiceCo now crack out.

104
00:05:57.950 --> 00:06:02.060
This institutes performs all hygienic and bacteriological laboratory work for

105
00:06:02.061 --> 00:06:04.550
the local access of air marks and police units.

106
00:06:04.760 --> 00:06:09.110
It's lab analyzed samples of blood and other fluids do detect cases of typhus,

107
00:06:09.140 --> 00:06:10.670
malaria, and syphilis.

108
00:06:10.730 --> 00:06:15.020
It also managed growth cultures for a variety of bacteria in order to develop

109
00:06:15.021 --> 00:06:18.830
antibiotic treatments and vaccines because of his experience with bacterial

110
00:06:18.860 --> 00:06:21.500
cultures. This was a logical assignment for Dr. Munch.

111
00:06:21.560 --> 00:06:25.280
He later realized that the hygiene Institute was assigned regular shipments of

112
00:06:25.281 --> 00:06:28.580
beef to be used in the bacterial cultures. The meat, however,

113
00:06:28.590 --> 00:06:32.450
was often seized by assets officers for culinary purposes.

114
00:06:32.510 --> 00:06:35.840
The lab technicians sent to make do with other materials do replace the

115
00:06:35.841 --> 00:06:36.860
confiscated beef.

116
00:06:36.920 --> 00:06:41.210
Typically it was human flesh coming from the corpses of prisoners resistance

117
00:06:41.211 --> 00:06:44.540
fighters, dissidents, homosexuals, religious minorities,

118
00:06:45.080 --> 00:06:47.750
Roma Cindy Jews. In other words,

119
00:06:47.870 --> 00:06:52.340
undesirables whose dead bodies could be provided in industrial quantities by a

120
00:06:52.341 --> 00:06:55.220
structure located some four kilometers from Bryce,

121
00:06:55.221 --> 00:07:00.200
go in a place called Oswiecim. And this is better known by its German name.

122
00:07:07.650 --> 00:07:08.620
I was going to borrow a tree.

123
00:07:08.680 --> 00:07:12.250
It was one of many satellite facilities of the larger outfits back in our

124
00:07:12.251 --> 00:07:16.600
complex, which was dedicated to medical, chemical, and pharmacological work.

125
00:07:16.660 --> 00:07:20.050
The hygiene Institute's main task was to control outbreaks of infectious

126
00:07:20.051 --> 00:07:23.290
diseases at the campus is to trial new medicines.

127
00:07:23.350 --> 00:07:27.430
Other facilities and medical teams were purposefully dedicated to dangerous

128
00:07:27.460 --> 00:07:29.740
unethical experimentation on human subjects.

129
00:07:29.770 --> 00:07:34.630
The most infamous cases of the angel of death, Dr. Joseph Mengele,

130
00:07:34.660 --> 00:07:37.360
whose biography we've already covered on this channel,

131
00:07:37.510 --> 00:07:41.560
Mengele was particularly notorious for his trials on identical twins.

132
00:07:41.561 --> 00:07:43.960
The so-called perfect specimens.

133
00:07:44.050 --> 00:07:48.550
One could serve as a control subject while the other Intuit the experiments.

134
00:07:48.820 --> 00:07:52.900
It was the environment that welcomed Dr. Mudge decent man,

135
00:07:52.901 --> 00:07:57.370
with this interest in Nazi ideology and with no ambitions of advancing his own

136
00:07:57.371 --> 00:08:00.610
career at the expense of unwilling test subjects.

137
00:08:01.120 --> 00:08:04.210
Munch later stated that after visiting the main camp for the first time with his

138
00:08:04.211 --> 00:08:05.830
wife, both were shocked.

139
00:08:06.070 --> 00:08:09.730
His wife refused to take lodgings and RiceCo and returned to Germany,

140
00:08:09.820 --> 00:08:12.460
could harms have done the same. In a later interview,

141
00:08:12.461 --> 00:08:15.610
he claims that SS officers and soldiers did not have a choice to leave

142
00:08:15.611 --> 00:08:17.320
Auschwitz. Once they had been assigned to it.

143
00:08:17.410 --> 00:08:21.700
This was disputed by the interviewer Dagmar Osterman as an Auschwitz prisoner.

144
00:08:21.701 --> 00:08:25.900
She was forcibly drafted as clerical helper into an administrative office within

145
00:08:25.901 --> 00:08:30.610
the camp that she processed several requests of SS personnel who would rather go

146
00:08:30.611 --> 00:08:34.390
to the front than serve at Auschwitz. So if he had the chance to leave,

147
00:08:34.810 --> 00:08:38.890
why did he stay dark diminish claims that after his initial months of the

148
00:08:38.891 --> 00:08:39.724
Institute,

149
00:08:40.060 --> 00:08:43.690
coworkers and prisoners themselves asked him not to leave as he was needed that.

150
00:08:43.990 --> 00:08:46.360
So why did they need him? Because very early on,

151
00:08:46.390 --> 00:08:51.370
Dr. Munch behaved like one of the only real human beings on the German side of

152
00:08:51.371 --> 00:08:53.350
the camp, like a real doctor,

153
00:08:53.410 --> 00:08:56.490
more loyal to the Hippocratic oath than to the third Reich.

154
00:08:56.700 --> 00:08:59.700
The hygienic institutes was staffed by some hundred prisoners,

155
00:08:59.701 --> 00:09:03.840
mostly Jewish and Polish. With previous experience in medicine and lab research,

156
00:09:03.870 --> 00:09:05.310
they worked at rice goat,

157
00:09:05.340 --> 00:09:09.510
essentially a skilled slave labor and under munches direct supervision.

158
00:09:09.720 --> 00:09:10.890
As they joined the Institute,

159
00:09:10.920 --> 00:09:14.010
these workers would be marched in and mistreated by SS guards.

160
00:09:14.460 --> 00:09:17.910
Munch was the only one who took time to meet each one in person shaking their

161
00:09:17.911 --> 00:09:19.980
hands and welcoming them to the Institute.

162
00:09:20.040 --> 00:09:23.670
The simple act of civility put him under the spotlight of his superiors.

163
00:09:23.790 --> 00:09:27.180
Someone nudged me that my behavior was unacceptable. One prisoner,

164
00:09:27.181 --> 00:09:31.680
Dr. Lewis miracles also worked with them daily and described ministers friendly.

165
00:09:31.740 --> 00:09:35.130
He showed personal interest in people never humiliated anyone.

166
00:09:35.340 --> 00:09:39.510
He seemed oddly out of place. Now, just before we continue with today's video,

167
00:09:39.511 --> 00:09:42.150
I do want to take a moment to thank who's made it possible.

168
00:09:42.360 --> 00:09:43.290
And that's curiosity,

169
00:09:43.291 --> 00:09:46.440
stream curiosity stream is a subscription streaming service that offers

187
00:10:42.290 --> 00:10:42.470
<v 1>[Inaudible].</v>

188
00:10:42.470 --> 00:10:46.280
<v 0>Looking off to the staff at Roscoe was one of the reasons for munch to stay.</v>

189
00:10:46.520 --> 00:10:49.220
The other was related to the infamous block. 10.

190
00:10:49.430 --> 00:10:52.010
This was a ward where the chief medical officer at Auschwitz,

191
00:10:52.011 --> 00:10:56.510
Dr. Edward worths studied new diagnostic methods for cervical

192
00:10:56.511 --> 00:10:58.130
cancer, useful research,

193
00:10:58.160 --> 00:11:01.490
but carried out on subjects without their informed consent.

194
00:11:01.550 --> 00:11:03.260
Since April the first 1943,

195
00:11:03.980 --> 00:11:07.460
Lockton was also the theater of sterilization experiments here,

196
00:11:07.461 --> 00:11:11.660
Dr. Carla clawback sought a method for sterilizing unsuspecting women.

197
00:11:11.750 --> 00:11:15.740
He devised a technique of injecting a caustic substance into a patient's uterus

198
00:11:15.890 --> 00:11:20.120
over the course of what she thought was an ordinary gynecological examination.

199
00:11:20.270 --> 00:11:22.520
A camp survivor. Describe these experiments.

200
00:11:22.850 --> 00:11:25.880
A wide substance was then injected into my uterus.

201
00:11:26.090 --> 00:11:28.010
The syringe was about 30 centimeters,

202
00:11:28.011 --> 00:11:32.120
long such injections were done to me three times with breaks of three or four

203
00:11:32.121 --> 00:11:35.960
months after each injection, I had a terrible burning sensation in my abdomen,

204
00:11:36.290 --> 00:11:39.200
Dr. Claire Berg was assisted by an us Sylvia effort,

205
00:11:39.230 --> 00:11:40.820
Jewish prisoner from Slovakia,

206
00:11:40.850 --> 00:11:45.020
Dr. Moon shoot worked occasionally unblocked and described her as being about 20

207
00:11:45.021 --> 00:11:47.960
years old, tall, and very beautiful. More importantly,

208
00:11:47.990 --> 00:11:52.250
she was Claire Berg's right-hand and demanded, absolute respect as she selected,

209
00:11:52.251 --> 00:11:54.250
which women would sent to the gas chambers, uh,

210
00:11:54.550 --> 00:11:56.980
back and out when Doug was moved to another post,

211
00:11:56.981 --> 00:11:59.470
some 25 young women were still in block 10.

212
00:11:59.830 --> 00:12:03.550
The function was now to provide saliva samples to the hygiene Institute in rice

213
00:12:03.551 --> 00:12:03.970
go.

214
00:12:03.970 --> 00:12:07.900
But eventually when she superiors Austin determinates the collection of saliva,

215
00:12:08.140 --> 00:12:09.340
as innocuous as it sounded,

216
00:12:09.341 --> 00:12:12.370
the cessation of saliva samples was a death sentence for those women.

217
00:12:12.670 --> 00:12:15.220
Now that they weren't nice involved in experiments any longer,

218
00:12:15.580 --> 00:12:16.660
they were going to be gassed.

219
00:12:16.900 --> 00:12:20.710
Dr. Munch could not accept that during a sleepless night, he devised a plan.

220
00:12:20.860 --> 00:12:24.370
He concocted a new experiments requiring these women as participants,

221
00:12:24.530 --> 00:12:25.480
a clinical trial,

222
00:12:25.481 --> 00:12:30.310
to assess the efficacy of a new vaccine against granuloma and infection of the

223
00:12:30.311 --> 00:12:30.880
gums.

224
00:12:30.880 --> 00:12:34.870
The project was approved and he was able to save the young women with blocker

225
00:12:34.871 --> 00:12:36.070
10. He owns them.

226
00:12:36.130 --> 00:12:40.120
You must tell everyone that these experiments are very painful and disagreeable

227
00:12:40.180 --> 00:12:43.210
so that the headquarters people do not get wind of anything.

228
00:12:43.390 --> 00:12:47.740
This was one of many instances in which Dr. Munch designs, new homeless trials,

229
00:12:47.741 --> 00:12:52.030
or extended pre-existing experiments to ensure test subjects were not marched to

230
00:12:52.031 --> 00:12:54.010
the infamous showers of the camp.

231
00:12:54.310 --> 00:12:57.490
He found ways to help prisoners more directly as well and official court

232
00:12:57.491 --> 00:13:01.390
document later stated he was helpful in the frame of his possibilities and even

233
00:13:01.391 --> 00:13:04.510
risking his own safety. For example, Dr. Munch helps women,

234
00:13:04.511 --> 00:13:07.960
prisoners meets their husbands in secrets. He succeeded in exempting.

235
00:13:08.350 --> 00:13:10.570
These two inmates from the punishment battalion,

236
00:13:10.571 --> 00:13:12.940
and he ensured the transfer away from Bryce,

237
00:13:12.941 --> 00:13:17.080
go of an SS guard against whom the prisoners had complained prisoner and

238
00:13:17.081 --> 00:13:21.310
colleague, Dr. Morales became very ill with appendicitis in the summer of 1944.

239
00:13:21.550 --> 00:13:23.050
Munch visited him frequently.

240
00:13:23.350 --> 00:13:26.860
UNC was convalescing ensuring that McCall's had a full recovery after five

241
00:13:26.861 --> 00:13:28.750
weeks, Dr. Miracles returned to the Institute,

242
00:13:28.990 --> 00:13:32.020
but it was very weak due to a lack of food. On his first day back,

243
00:13:32.050 --> 00:13:35.980
munch approached him and with great secrecy pulled something out of his pocket.

244
00:13:36.100 --> 00:13:38.920
It was an item you had smuggled to help make ELLs with his recovery.

245
00:13:39.250 --> 00:13:43.660
A nice sausage munch ordered McCall's to eat and have some rest intervening.

246
00:13:43.661 --> 00:13:47.620
When an SS gone grumbled that the prisoner was not on duty later that summer in

247
00:13:47.621 --> 00:13:51.160
1944, Dr. Munch was required to expand his normal duties.

248
00:13:51.370 --> 00:13:55.180
Auschwitz had just received a great influx of Jewish prisoners from Hungary.

249
00:13:55.270 --> 00:13:59.200
It was then that all medical personnel on the site were drafted to take part in

250
00:13:59.201 --> 00:14:03.040
the infamous selection process. Colloquially known as ramp duty.

251
00:14:03.130 --> 00:14:06.790
This is when doctors examined prisoners as they stepped off transport trains and

252
00:14:06.791 --> 00:14:08.080
decided who would work,

253
00:14:08.350 --> 00:14:11.800
who would be used in experiments and who would be sent directly to the gas

254
00:14:11.830 --> 00:14:14.050
chambers, the chief medical officer at Auschwitz,

255
00:14:14.080 --> 00:14:17.800
Edward Wirth insisted that all doctors participated in ramp duty,

256
00:14:18.040 --> 00:14:21.190
but Dr. Munch would not participate in this arbitrary selection,

257
00:14:21.340 --> 00:14:23.080
thinly disguised power trip,

258
00:14:23.200 --> 00:14:26.800
presiding over the life and death of thousands of innocent men,

259
00:14:27.070 --> 00:14:31.660
women and children. Dr. Werth may have had authority over doctors at Auschwitz,

260
00:14:31.661 --> 00:14:34.070
but munch formally reported to Paul.

261
00:14:34.630 --> 00:14:38.230
Reichel the head of all hygienic institutes headquartered in Berlin. Munch,

262
00:14:38.231 --> 00:14:41.620
contacted him and told him I cannot do it. I will not do it.

263
00:14:41.770 --> 00:14:43.360
Regardless of the consequences.

264
00:14:43.690 --> 00:14:46.600
His boss understood after pulling some strings with the camp commander,

265
00:14:46.660 --> 00:14:50.020
he had much exempted from the selection process. More importantly,

266
00:14:50.080 --> 00:14:52.520
there were no direct consequences. Proving again,

267
00:14:52.521 --> 00:14:56.930
that inside of Auschwitz and SS officer was the only person who has ever treated

268
00:14:57.050 --> 00:15:00.050
with any shred of respect or humanity.

269
00:15:06.430 --> 00:15:06.970
<v 1>In January.</v>

270
00:15:06.970 --> 00:15:11.020
<v 0>We have 1945 SSL authorities began the evacuation of Auschwitz as the red army</v>

271
00:15:11.021 --> 00:15:12.430
pressed closer from the East,

272
00:15:12.610 --> 00:15:15.790
all the Jewish prisoners working at RiceCo received the news that they would be

273
00:15:15.791 --> 00:15:17.770
transferred to an unknown destination.

274
00:15:18.040 --> 00:15:21.640
The lab workers were reluctant suspecting that they were going to be sent on a

275
00:15:21.641 --> 00:15:25.240
death March headed by Dr. Miracles. They decided to talk to munch.

276
00:15:25.510 --> 00:15:29.140
He shared their concerns and even suggested helping them in a daring escape

277
00:15:29.141 --> 00:15:29.680
attempts.

278
00:15:29.680 --> 00:15:33.250
He would procure SS uniforms and walks them through the Gates of Auschwitz to

279
00:15:33.251 --> 00:15:36.370
freedom. Eventually they agreed. It was safer to join the transport column,

280
00:15:36.550 --> 00:15:37.960
then escaped toward the Swiss Alps.

281
00:15:38.050 --> 00:15:41.860
Dr. [inaudible] survived the late stages of the war and wrote about his last

282
00:15:41.861 --> 00:15:44.530
goodbye with Dr. Munch to prove as Goodwill.

283
00:15:44.590 --> 00:15:48.580
He gave us a revolver in his ammunition in case we have to shoot all why out is

284
00:15:48.581 --> 00:15:51.010
your cans with each of us and wish to Saudi freedom?

285
00:15:51.400 --> 00:15:55.300
That was the last I saw of him. Document was also evacuated.

286
00:15:55.480 --> 00:15:58.840
They spent two months in Dachau and then returned home to Bavaria,

287
00:15:58.900 --> 00:16:02.590
but he wasn't able to hide the fact that he had been a doctor at Auschwitz hums

288
00:16:02.591 --> 00:16:06.340
was eventually arrested by the allied occupation authorities and interned in an

289
00:16:06.350 --> 00:16:10.780
American pow camp. From that he was transferred to Krakow in 1946.

290
00:16:10.990 --> 00:16:15.400
He was to sit on the bench of the accused at the first Auschwitz trial from

291
00:16:15.401 --> 00:16:17.440
November the 24th to December the 22nd,

292
00:16:17.441 --> 00:16:21.580
1947 42 former staff from the concentration camp were put on trial.

293
00:16:21.610 --> 00:16:23.980
23 of the defendants were sentenced to death.

294
00:16:24.130 --> 00:16:26.830
21 of them were hanged on January the 28th,

295
00:16:26.840 --> 00:16:30.040
1948 to have their sentences commuted to life.

296
00:16:30.041 --> 00:16:34.180
Imprisonment 18 defendants were found guilty and sentenced to various terms in

297
00:16:34.181 --> 00:16:38.590
prison. Only one out of all of them was acquitted and released Dr.

298
00:16:38.590 --> 00:16:43.510
Hans munch, the righteous doctor, the good man of Auschwitz during the trial.

299
00:16:43.511 --> 00:16:46.810
The main judge against him was that he had injected prisoners with malaria

300
00:16:46.840 --> 00:16:47.673
infected blood.

301
00:16:47.860 --> 00:16:52.450
It was alleged that he had caused dramatic fever by injecting an unknown agent

302
00:16:52.451 --> 00:16:54.010
into his human Guinea pigs.

303
00:16:54.160 --> 00:16:56.920
But many former prisoners came out in support of munch,

304
00:16:57.160 --> 00:17:00.940
Dr. Louis miracles and other surviving Jews sent their testimonies to Monk's

305
00:17:00.941 --> 00:17:02.860
former boss, Paul Reichel the crack,

306
00:17:03.010 --> 00:17:06.670
our court acknowledged how munch had refused to carry out the selection process.

307
00:17:06.671 --> 00:17:09.430
And how are we going to help prisoners with bogus experiments?

308
00:17:09.520 --> 00:17:13.720
It emerged that he had never inoculated malaria and that his injections were

309
00:17:13.721 --> 00:17:17.890
intended to treat rheumatism rather than cause it on the 22nd of December,

310
00:17:17.891 --> 00:17:20.080
the court acquitted him with the following motivation,

311
00:17:20.110 --> 00:17:24.250
not only because he did not commit any crime of harm against the camp prisoners,

312
00:17:24.400 --> 00:17:28.150
but because he had a benevolent attitude toward them and helps them.

313
00:17:28.330 --> 00:17:30.820
He did this independently from the nationality,

314
00:17:30.880 --> 00:17:34.630
race and religious origin and political conviction of the person.

315
00:17:41.650 --> 00:17:42.160
<v 1>After the trial.</v>

316
00:17:42.160 --> 00:17:42.850
<v 0>Munch,</v>

317
00:17:42.850 --> 00:17:46.180
Roseanne into Germany and began working as a practicing doctor in rails Hopton

318
00:17:46.181 --> 00:17:47.680
Bavaria for many years,

319
00:17:47.710 --> 00:17:51.750
neither munch nor his spoke to their children about his experience at Auschwitz.

320
00:17:51.780 --> 00:17:53.970
All they knew was that he had been on trial,

321
00:17:54.240 --> 00:17:56.940
but that he had been acquitted it's on Doug, latest out.

322
00:17:57.210 --> 00:17:59.310
I think my father was somewhat paralyzed.

323
00:17:59.370 --> 00:18:03.750
He could not talk very much to his children about what he saw and felt in the

324
00:18:03.751 --> 00:18:05.100
decades. After the end of the war,

325
00:18:05.130 --> 00:18:07.680
Dr. Munch became a sought after witness and expert.

326
00:18:07.860 --> 00:18:10.590
His opinion was consulted by prosecutors, journalists,

327
00:18:10.591 --> 00:18:14.100
and survivors to shed light on the atrocities perpetrated at Auschwitz.

328
00:18:14.130 --> 00:18:15.690
For example, in 1955,

329
00:18:15.691 --> 00:18:19.890
Dr. [inaudible] the torture of block 10 returns to West Germany,

330
00:18:19.920 --> 00:18:20.753
right after the war,

331
00:18:20.760 --> 00:18:24.390
he had been arrested by the Soviets and kept in captivity for a decade upon his

332
00:18:24.391 --> 00:18:24.751
return.

333
00:18:24.751 --> 00:18:27.750
He made several public statements about the medical importance of his work at

334
00:18:27.751 --> 00:18:31.320
Auschwitz survivors of blockchain and their families immediately petitioned for

335
00:18:31.770 --> 00:18:34.290
Colberg to be tried in June of 1946, Dr.

336
00:18:34.530 --> 00:18:38.160
Munch was then approached by prosecutors and he volunteered his testimony,

337
00:18:38.310 --> 00:18:42.420
providing valuable details about the activities of Colberg and his right-hand

338
00:18:42.421 --> 00:18:44.970
woman nurseries to RAF. Some years later,

339
00:18:45.330 --> 00:18:48.720
moonshot was summons to the second dash Fitz trial. This time as a key witness,

340
00:18:48.930 --> 00:18:51.540
the second trial was held in Frankfurt from December the 10th,

341
00:18:51.541 --> 00:18:54.240
1963 to August the 10th, 1965,

342
00:18:54.300 --> 00:18:58.350
22 former SS officers and guards were indicted for their complicity in war

343
00:18:58.351 --> 00:19:00.120
crimes. Thanks to much testimony.

344
00:19:00.330 --> 00:19:03.720
18 were found guilty and sentenced to various terms of imprisonment.

345
00:19:03.960 --> 00:19:05.070
During the early 1980s,

346
00:19:05.100 --> 00:19:08.730
Dr. Mudge participated into documentary films produced for German TV,

347
00:19:08.790 --> 00:19:09.780
the director of one of them,

348
00:19:09.840 --> 00:19:13.770
Bernard Frankfurter later arranged for the doctor to meet with a camp survivor

349
00:19:13.800 --> 00:19:14.880
Dagmar, Osterman,

350
00:19:15.210 --> 00:19:19.680
whom we already quoted Dagmar interviewed hands lengths in April of 1988.

351
00:19:19.770 --> 00:19:21.720
The transcripts was later published in the book,

352
00:19:21.721 --> 00:19:25.950
titled the meeting and Auschwitz survivor confronts and SS physician.

353
00:19:26.130 --> 00:19:30.270
The interview sheds light on how and why munch eventually joined the Nazi party

354
00:19:30.450 --> 00:19:31.081
and the SS.

355
00:19:31.081 --> 00:19:35.550
It also reveals many details on how exactly it helps prisoners at the camp.

356
00:19:35.610 --> 00:19:39.300
However, the editors of the book, Frankfurter and Susan Cerney expense,

357
00:19:39.301 --> 00:19:42.210
also a camp survivor offer a different interpretation.

358
00:19:42.300 --> 00:19:44.550
They posit that munch knew very well.

359
00:19:44.551 --> 00:19:48.060
What was going on at Auschwitz long before working there and that he stated his

360
00:19:48.061 --> 00:19:52.950
post in rice gal out of opportunism and chrism mitigated by sporadic

361
00:19:52.951 --> 00:19:55.350
acts of kindness. In August of 1993,

362
00:19:55.920 --> 00:19:59.730
[inaudible] was interviewed by another Auschwitz survivor, either Moses core,

363
00:19:59.850 --> 00:20:03.630
either into twin sister, Miriam had arrived at the camp in the spring of 1944,

364
00:20:03.930 --> 00:20:05.250
age 10, their parents,

365
00:20:05.251 --> 00:20:09.120
and two older sisters almost immediately selected to die in the gas chambers.

366
00:20:09.300 --> 00:20:13.290
The twins were chosen by Dr. Mengele to be among his test subjects.

367
00:20:13.380 --> 00:20:17.430
When the Soviets liberated Auschwitz on January the 27th, 1945,

368
00:20:17.610 --> 00:20:22.290
only 200 out of three thousands of Mandela's twins that survived

369
00:20:22.410 --> 00:20:25.830
Eva and Miriam are among the lucky few. When Marianne died,

370
00:20:26.970 --> 00:20:30.600
Eva opens in her memory, the candles museum and Terre Haute,

371
00:20:30.601 --> 00:20:34.410
Indiana candles stands for children of Auschwitz, Nazi death,

372
00:20:34.440 --> 00:20:38.280
lab experiments survivors, while organizing a conference on Nazi medicine,

373
00:20:38.310 --> 00:20:42.750
Eva decided to contact Dr. Munch. She wanted to know more about Dr. Mengele,

374
00:20:42.780 --> 00:20:45.780
but Huns couldn't give her much insight. He knew him,

375
00:20:46.050 --> 00:20:49.810
but he had not worked alongside him either at questioned him about the operation

376
00:20:49.811 --> 00:20:53.740
of the gas chambers. And he replied, this is the nightmare I live with.

377
00:20:53.950 --> 00:20:56.170
I had to watch the operation of the gas chambers,

378
00:20:56.171 --> 00:21:00.070
and then when the bodies were dead, I had to sign the death certificates.

379
00:21:00.220 --> 00:21:04.300
Wounds provide a detailed descriptions on how the pallets of colorless odorless

380
00:21:04.301 --> 00:21:08.170
cycle on B gas were dropped through the advent, since the mock showers,

381
00:21:08.380 --> 00:21:10.540
this was a precious testimony.

382
00:21:10.690 --> 00:21:14.710
One that would finally shut the tramp of those few remaining morons who denied

383
00:21:14.711 --> 00:21:19.330
the existence of the gas chambers or even worse deny that the Shoah and the

384
00:21:19.331 --> 00:21:23.500
extermination of other undesirables ever took place. Two years later,

385
00:21:23.920 --> 00:21:26.350
munchkin Eva joined forces again for a special event.

386
00:21:26.440 --> 00:21:28.720
It was the 27th of January, 1995,

387
00:21:28.900 --> 00:21:32.500
the 50th anniversary of the liberation of Auschwitz on Eva's invitation,

388
00:21:32.620 --> 00:21:37.480
Dr. Munez joins the televised commemoration during which Eva read two documents

389
00:21:37.630 --> 00:21:38.950
that they had authored and signed.

390
00:21:39.130 --> 00:21:42.910
The first one was a declaration by Dr. Munch in which he attempted the existence

391
00:21:42.911 --> 00:21:47.230
of the gas chambers. I saw thousands of people, gas tear at Auschwitz, children,

392
00:21:47.290 --> 00:21:51.340
old people, the sick and those unable to work were sent to the gas chambers.

393
00:21:51.400 --> 00:21:55.120
These were innocent human beings, Jews gypsies, homosexuals,

394
00:21:55.570 --> 00:21:56.470
Hitler's political opponents,

395
00:21:56.471 --> 00:22:01.240
anyone who did not fit Hitler's idea of pure Aryan race.

396
00:22:01.390 --> 00:22:04.900
I am signing this paper of my own free will to help documents the cruel

397
00:22:04.901 --> 00:22:06.370
intolerance of my fellow.

398
00:22:06.371 --> 00:22:11.320
SS I a format SS physician witnessed the dropping of Zyklon B into simulated

399
00:22:11.321 --> 00:22:15.280
exhaust vents from outside the gas chambers up to three to five minutes.

400
00:22:15.700 --> 00:22:19.600
Death could be certified. This is the nightmare I continue to live with.

401
00:22:19.660 --> 00:22:23.560
50 years later, Eva's document was equally powerful in her declaration.

402
00:22:23.561 --> 00:22:27.550
She had decided to forgive the torture iron's execution as an Auschwitz,

403
00:22:27.610 --> 00:22:31.360
even Dr. Mengele, I even most as core in my name,

404
00:22:31.390 --> 00:22:34.630
only give this amnesty because it is time to go on.

405
00:22:34.720 --> 00:22:38.710
It is time to heal our souls. It is time to forgive,

406
00:22:39.130 --> 00:22:40.060
but never forget.

407
00:22:46.410 --> 00:22:47.190
Never forget.

408
00:22:47.190 --> 00:22:51.240
That was the main message carried by Hans Eva and others who had designed it to

409
00:22:51.241 --> 00:22:53.850
document the darkness of the concentration camps.

410
00:22:54.000 --> 00:22:58.320
Individual memories are the greatest weapon against the return of such darkness,

411
00:22:58.350 --> 00:23:01.860
but the memory of an individual can be fickle and unreliable,

412
00:23:02.100 --> 00:23:06.150
especially in old age when the ravages of dementia and Alzheimer's disease can

413
00:23:06.330 --> 00:23:11.250
wipe clean the slate of one's memory or distorted changing the perception of

414
00:23:11.251 --> 00:23:14.340
the presence and its interpretation of the past. Sadly,

415
00:23:14.640 --> 00:23:18.240
that is what happens during the final act of Dr. Hahn's munches life.

416
00:23:18.390 --> 00:23:22.170
In November of 1998, he was interviewed by a German magazine dish Spiegel,

417
00:23:22.500 --> 00:23:25.320
often a viewing of Steven Spielberg's Schindler's list.

418
00:23:25.470 --> 00:23:29.760
Dr. Munch was a household name and widely known as the good man from Auschwitz.

419
00:23:29.850 --> 00:23:33.510
And yes, during the interview, he made several shocking disparaging,

420
00:23:33.540 --> 00:23:37.470
hateful comments about the Jewish people and even praised Dr. Mengele,

421
00:23:37.590 --> 00:23:41.730
his work Mengele, and the others sent us their material heads, livers,

422
00:23:41.790 --> 00:23:45.120
spinal fluid, whatever came up, munch claims. It was thanks.

423
00:23:45.260 --> 00:23:48.770
This provision of organic material that he could perform experiments in ideal

424
00:23:48.771 --> 00:23:52.910
conditions. He even mentioned intentionally infecting prisoners with malaria.

425
00:23:52.970 --> 00:23:56.690
The interview was followed by another media appearance in a French radio station

426
00:23:56.810 --> 00:23:57.890
during the broadcast,

427
00:23:57.891 --> 00:24:01.940
which stated there's Romer and Cindy prisoners at Auschwitz were pathetic.

428
00:24:02.090 --> 00:24:05.150
And that the gas chambers with the right solution to get rid of them,

429
00:24:05.330 --> 00:24:07.880
both his son and daughter were aghast at these comments.

430
00:24:07.940 --> 00:24:11.060
They revealed to the media that their father had been suffering from Alzheimer's

431
00:24:11.061 --> 00:24:14.750
disease for a while. Now, it almost completely lost his short-term memory.

432
00:24:14.990 --> 00:24:17.000
And he lived in a state of mental confusion.

433
00:24:17.120 --> 00:24:20.960
This is the explanation on which most media outlets agreed upon.

434
00:24:21.080 --> 00:24:24.590
After all his conduct at Auschwitz had been clearly documented at the first

435
00:24:24.591 --> 00:24:26.150
trial shortly after the war.

436
00:24:26.240 --> 00:24:29.390
Many witness accounts from prisoners had exonerated him from atrocities,

437
00:24:29.660 --> 00:24:33.440
especially infecting prisoners with deadly diseases, munches declarations,

438
00:24:33.470 --> 00:24:37.130
nonetheless sparked two court proceedings in France and Germany on counts of

439
00:24:37.131 --> 00:24:40.550
instigating racial hatred and supporting Nazi ideology.

440
00:24:40.610 --> 00:24:44.780
In the case of the French trial in 2001, harms munch was convicted in absentia.

441
00:24:44.900 --> 00:24:47.840
Although a medical commission recognized him as being severely,

442
00:24:47.841 --> 00:24:51.380
psychologically disturbed. The verdict never reached him. Dr. Hans munch,

443
00:24:51.620 --> 00:24:56.420
then 90 years old had passed away and his family home in our Gallop of area.

444
00:24:56.630 --> 00:24:58.730
Now I'm not going to ask you if you enjoyed today's video,

445
00:24:58.731 --> 00:25:02.990
but I do hope that the story of hunting says inspired you to study and keep

446
00:25:02.991 --> 00:25:06.380
alive the memory of what happens in the camps and other Auschwitz,

447
00:25:06.740 --> 00:25:10.310
survivor Primo levy warned us that it happens. Therefore it can happen again.

448
00:25:10.400 --> 00:25:15.200
This is the core of what we have to say is can happen and it can happen

449
00:25:15.201 --> 00:25:15.680
everywhere.
