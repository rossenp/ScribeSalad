If year one sets more on them in a bits

5
00:00:17.660 --> 00:00:19.320
In the spring of 985,

6
00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:23.270
80 a small fleet sets sale on a history making mission among the crew were

7
00:00:23.271 --> 00:00:27.950
hundreds of men and women looking to start AF fresh to begin new lives far from

8
00:00:27.951 --> 00:00:29.710
home. They took with them livestock, timber,

9
00:00:29.890 --> 00:00:33.990
all of the things that need to establish themselves at the edge of the world.

10
00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:36.990
It was a leap of faith, not just because of the treacherous voyage,

11
00:00:37.130 --> 00:00:40.830
not just because they were attempting to found a colony where no one had ever

12
00:00:40.831 --> 00:00:42.140
lived bit before. No,

13
00:00:42.320 --> 00:00:45.100
it was because these people were placing not just their futures,

14
00:00:45.101 --> 00:00:49.780
but their lives in the hands of a single man. His name was Eric, the red,

15
00:00:49.960 --> 00:00:53.740
and he was destined to found Greenland's first nos settlements,

16
00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:57.740
born to a criminal father in Norway. Eric had spent most of his life as a minor.

17
00:00:57.741 --> 00:01:00.940
Nobody eeking out in existence on the edges of Iceland,

18
00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:05.330
but then he got involved in a dispute and everything had changed banished from

19
00:01:05.331 --> 00:01:05.930
his home.

20
00:01:05.930 --> 00:01:10.330
Eric was forced to sail west in search of new lands only to wind up settling the

21
00:01:10.331 --> 00:01:11.810
largest island of the mall.

22
00:01:17.710 --> 00:01:22.480
It was 950 80 when Eric thought Valson was born in a place rogue

23
00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:24.360
land in the Southwest of Norway,

24
00:01:24.500 --> 00:01:29.440
at least we assume it was as you're about to see pretty much everything to do

25
00:01:29.441 --> 00:01:33.680
with Eric. The Red's life involves a bunch of guesswork, a whole lot of caveats.

26
00:01:33.740 --> 00:01:38.600
And the understanding that's anywhere up to 90% might just

27
00:01:38.740 --> 00:01:40.080
be well Posman. Yeah,

28
00:01:40.081 --> 00:01:43.870
that's because our hero today was born in a time and place in which complex

29
00:01:43.871 --> 00:01:46.830
written records weren't yet widely used. Instead,

30
00:01:46.831 --> 00:01:51.030
people relied on oral traditions telling each other stories, passing them down,

31
00:01:51.031 --> 00:01:54.390
maybe subtly altering them with each telling famously.

32
00:01:54.391 --> 00:01:57.950
This includes the sagas from where we get everything that we know about Eric,

33
00:01:58.010 --> 00:01:59.710
the red, the problem, the saga of Eric,

34
00:01:59.711 --> 00:02:03.620
the reds and the saga of the Greenlanders wasn't written down until something

35
00:02:03.621 --> 00:02:06.420
like over 200 years since it died.

36
00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:09.660
So rather than me going historians assume that,

37
00:02:09.760 --> 00:02:14.220
or it suspected that every time I mention a fact, let's just agree.

38
00:02:14.220 --> 00:02:18.060
Now that this entire episode comes with a massive caveat titled warning.

39
00:02:18.160 --> 00:02:21.740
All of this could be absolute. Now, with that being said,

40
00:02:21.741 --> 00:02:25.210
we do have an enough archeological evidence to say that Eric was a real person

41
00:02:25.310 --> 00:02:28.330
and that his most famous deeds did really happen.

42
00:02:28.520 --> 00:02:30.570
It's just where his personal life is concerned.

43
00:02:30.571 --> 00:02:34.170
That things get frustratingly vague to return to our opening.

44
00:02:34.430 --> 00:02:38.730
We commonly assume Eric was born in 950 because it matches up with the other

45
00:02:38.860 --> 00:02:40.130
dates given in the sagas.

46
00:02:40.131 --> 00:02:44.010
But we don't actually know this anymore than we know that he had the nickname at

47
00:02:44.280 --> 00:02:44.801
Eric, the red,

48
00:02:44.801 --> 00:02:48.120
which could be to do with the color of his hair or his legendary temper.

49
00:02:48.420 --> 00:02:52.600
All we know for sure is what the sagas tell us that sometime around the nine

50
00:02:52.630 --> 00:02:54.040
sixties, Eric and his father,

51
00:02:54.440 --> 00:02:58.080
Thor vol arrived in Iceland after thal managed to get his band from Norway

52
00:02:58.140 --> 00:03:00.320
likely for killing someone. If that's the case,

53
00:03:00.350 --> 00:03:04.520
then exile in Iceland was certainly a fitting punishment. First settled,

54
00:03:04.521 --> 00:03:05.560
roughly a century earlier.

55
00:03:05.670 --> 00:03:09.320
Iceland had been one of the focal points of a great wave of north migration

56
00:03:09.321 --> 00:03:11.160
brought on by political changes at home.

57
00:03:11.180 --> 00:03:15.320
The migration had seen the north settle all over Northwest Europe from England

58
00:03:15.420 --> 00:03:18.200
to Ireland, to the Shetland islands and pharaohs.

59
00:03:18.510 --> 00:03:22.990
Iceland was simply the most distant lands that they colonized in this.

60
00:03:23.090 --> 00:03:26.990
The north were helped by something known as the medieval warm period,

61
00:03:27.270 --> 00:03:30.510
a fourth century summer holiday in which temperature spiked around Europe,

62
00:03:30.610 --> 00:03:34.230
making even an island on the edge of the Arctic circle, easily habitable,

63
00:03:34.370 --> 00:03:37.230
all told about 20,000 people would settle Icelands.

64
00:03:37.290 --> 00:03:38.550
And that was a major problem.

65
00:03:39.420 --> 00:03:43.260
The Eric and his par by the time they showed up in the nine sixties,

66
00:03:43.560 --> 00:03:47.220
all the good land was already gone. Even the not so good lands,

67
00:03:47.221 --> 00:03:51.780
the mediocre lands and the actually kind of sucky land had all been snapped up

68
00:03:51.840 --> 00:03:56.420
the best Eric and Thorold could manage was the super crappy lands at

69
00:03:56.670 --> 00:04:01.450
horns strand deer place of PO soil and a short growing season.

70
00:04:01.680 --> 00:04:03.730
Clearly father and son were in trouble,

71
00:04:03.790 --> 00:04:07.050
but they weren't the only ones who were going to have difficulties farming in

72
00:04:07.051 --> 00:04:10.930
Iceland all across the island over grazing was driving down soil quality,

73
00:04:10.950 --> 00:04:14.850
making life harder. So when Eric eventually comes to pictures,

74
00:04:14.851 --> 00:04:16.290
Greenland's colony to the locals.

75
00:04:16.291 --> 00:04:20.320
There's going to be a surprising number of people thinking, well, well,

76
00:04:20.510 --> 00:04:23.240
it's gotta be a lot better than here, but look,

77
00:04:23.300 --> 00:04:26.680
all of that is in the future for now, Eric. And so could do nothing,

78
00:04:26.860 --> 00:04:31.320
but try to tend the unforgiving lands and hope that their lives would soon be

79
00:04:31.321 --> 00:04:35.200
changed for the better Buckley. Eric wouldn't have to wait very long at all.

80
00:04:35.380 --> 00:04:37.960
In a few short years, he was going to catch his first break.

81
00:04:38.160 --> 00:04:41.630
Cause the breaks that would set him on the path to it's becoming one of the

82
00:04:41.870 --> 00:04:44.590
greatest north explorers of all time.

83
00:04:50.970 --> 00:04:54.430
In the end, Eric, the Redwood escape is miserable. Corner of horn, strand deer,

84
00:04:54.610 --> 00:04:57.030
not through hard work, Chris, all she determination,

85
00:04:57.730 --> 00:04:59.790
but by marrying upwards,

86
00:05:00.270 --> 00:05:03.900
salt held was the order of a wealthy man who owned a swath of Hawk,

87
00:05:04.060 --> 00:05:05.740
had Del Lura long valley.

88
00:05:05.800 --> 00:05:08.700
The name of which can roughly be translated as valley of the Hawks.

89
00:05:08.701 --> 00:05:09.660
After she married Eric,

90
00:05:09.900 --> 00:05:13.220
a good old dad opened a corner of his estate for the couple to build their home

91
00:05:13.221 --> 00:05:17.340
on Eric abandoned the islands north moved south and founded a small farm that he

92
00:05:17.341 --> 00:05:18.660
called Eric study.

93
00:05:19.220 --> 00:05:23.170
It was nothing fancy ologists on top of the F and founded to be on the small

94
00:05:23.200 --> 00:05:26.530
side. But at least it was an area that was better suited to farming.

95
00:05:26.531 --> 00:05:27.364
Unfortunately,

96
00:05:27.480 --> 00:05:31.210
this lucky break was also accompanied by tragedy sometime around Eric's

97
00:05:31.290 --> 00:05:34.570
marriage. His dad saw VO kick the bucket, the exact date in cause of death,

98
00:05:34.610 --> 00:05:35.290
a run unknown.

99
00:05:35.290 --> 00:05:38.450
All we know is that he exited the narrative before his son ever had a chance to

100
00:05:38.451 --> 00:05:40.650
do anything of note. If he did leave a legacy,

101
00:05:41.170 --> 00:05:43.600
it seems to have been Aing onto Erica knack,

102
00:05:43.601 --> 00:05:45.840
forgetting banished from various places.

103
00:05:46.540 --> 00:05:51.200
As we are about to see Eric and soils created quite the little BR,

104
00:05:51.480 --> 00:05:52.720
they had three sons and one daughter,

105
00:05:52.780 --> 00:05:55.920
the latter of whom some sources say was born to another woman that tur was

106
00:05:55.921 --> 00:05:56.121
seeing.

107
00:05:56.121 --> 00:06:00.920
There's not much point in us going into any detail on these kids with one

108
00:06:00.921 --> 00:06:05.360
exception around nine 70 tho gave birth to a son that they called LA since

109
00:06:05.840 --> 00:06:09.240
North's names were patron Nemick meaning they included the father's given name.

110
00:06:09.241 --> 00:06:13.480
The boy's full name was LA Erickson and LA would soon grow up to rival his

111
00:06:13.481 --> 00:06:17.990
father. As an Explorer father, Eric had actually really done any exploring yet.

112
00:06:18.170 --> 00:06:20.710
He was too busy being a standard issue on Icelandic farmer,

113
00:06:20.711 --> 00:06:23.710
raising his children quarreling with his neighbors and trying to keep his

114
00:06:23.711 --> 00:06:24.750
servants in line.

115
00:06:24.850 --> 00:06:28.710
It was these two last points that were about to turn everything upside down

116
00:06:28.810 --> 00:06:32.750
around nine 80. Some of our strolls accidentally caused a landslide,

117
00:06:32.751 --> 00:06:37.260
captured slaves or surfs thralls were basically people's proper seat.

118
00:06:37.320 --> 00:06:40.140
So when their landslide damaged the farm of Eric's neighbor,

119
00:06:40.660 --> 00:06:42.460
Val of Val of dealt with him, not as people,

120
00:06:42.560 --> 00:06:46.740
but as things he dispatched his Kingsman, the delightfully named IOL,

121
00:06:47.060 --> 00:06:50.460
the foul who slaughtered Theros and just like that,

122
00:06:50.860 --> 00:06:53.300
IOF signed his own death warrant. Remember earlier when we said that Eric,

123
00:06:53.320 --> 00:06:56.260
the reds nickname may have been due to his foul temper. Well,

124
00:06:56.330 --> 00:07:01.010
this is the moment when we show you exactly why that might have been

125
00:07:01.011 --> 00:07:02.530
rather than just go to the law.

126
00:07:02.531 --> 00:07:06.170
Eric grabbed his own weapons marched right over to Val off's farm and

127
00:07:06.690 --> 00:07:10.890
slaughtered I off the foul while this might sound like AIP attack killing today.

128
00:07:11.130 --> 00:07:11.963
And Eric's time,

129
00:07:11.970 --> 00:07:14.930
there was like going ballistic computing your neighbor because he scratched your

130
00:07:15.650 --> 00:07:20.640
Carrolls were property dudes like now pretty dead or

131
00:07:20.641 --> 00:07:23.640
people that meant legal proceedings being launched against Eric.

132
00:07:23.700 --> 00:07:27.640
It meant being banished from the valley of Hawks' punishment and starting a new

133
00:07:27.670 --> 00:07:30.200
life on the island of Oxy. Sadly for his family.

134
00:07:30.270 --> 00:07:32.720
This was just the start of Eric's neighbor,

135
00:07:32.721 --> 00:07:35.600
killing spree while building his new homestead, Eric Glen,

136
00:07:35.800 --> 00:07:39.510
some seat posts to a local carved with Vikings and bulls and considered to have

137
00:07:39.511 --> 00:07:41.790
mystic powers. These posts were hugely valuable.

138
00:07:42.230 --> 00:07:43.950
Eric dad brought them all the way from Norway.

139
00:07:43.970 --> 00:07:47.870
So when Eric asked for the seat posts back in 982, the neighbor was all like,

140
00:07:48.630 --> 00:07:52.630
uh, actually that kind of mind now and well,

141
00:07:52.690 --> 00:07:57.270
the outcome was he inevitable blinded with bright red rage E

142
00:07:57.420 --> 00:08:00.580
stormed his neighbor's farm and to hook the seat posts by force.

143
00:08:00.940 --> 00:08:04.140
Then he organized an ambush to attack the rival clan, killing the neighbors.

144
00:08:04.340 --> 00:08:09.060
Two sons, the Icelands. This was the last straw. Eric was tried again,

145
00:08:09.061 --> 00:08:11.900
found guilty again and banished again, only this time,

146
00:08:11.901 --> 00:08:13.660
he wasn't just chucked out of his local area.

147
00:08:13.810 --> 00:08:16.700
This time Eric would be exiled from the whole of Iceland.

148
00:08:17.000 --> 00:08:19.380
Now we get back to our video in just a minute, but first,

149
00:08:19.690 --> 00:08:23.850
a quick word from today's fantastic sponsor Blinkist. It's the heart of July,

150
00:08:23.851 --> 00:08:26.330
which means that you're probably looking to check some books off your summer

151
00:08:26.331 --> 00:08:27.164
reading list.

152
00:08:27.270 --> 00:08:30.290
Few things are better than sitting in the park or maybe just lying on the beach,

153
00:08:30.291 --> 00:08:32.850
cracking a good book that you've been looking forward to. Now,

154
00:08:32.851 --> 00:08:35.570
if you want that same dopamine head of new information,

155
00:08:35.630 --> 00:08:37.610
but without the hours of personal investment,

156
00:08:37.611 --> 00:08:39.930
it takes to read something from cup to cover. Well,

157
00:08:40.180 --> 00:08:44.040
that's where Blinkist comes in. It's a great app that offers easily digestible,

158
00:08:44.041 --> 00:08:46.520
15 minute summaries of all of the best non-fiction books.

159
00:08:46.521 --> 00:08:48.320
There's more than 3000 of them.

160
00:08:48.321 --> 00:08:52.280
You can either read them or listen to the audio version personally by listen

161
00:08:52.281 --> 00:08:57.120
about 90% of the time, just like a short little value packed podcast episode.

162
00:08:57.120 --> 00:08:58.440
It's easier to fit into my day.

163
00:08:58.441 --> 00:09:01.840
That way while doing mindless things or walking to work, you know,

164
00:09:02.080 --> 00:09:06.040
the kind of everyday activities that you can listen to stuff during 14 million

165

Decades before Eric did for ism,

178
00:09:54.101 --> 00:09:58.450
what Michael Douglas did for LA and falling down a guy called gun Bern off

179
00:09:59.250 --> 00:10:00.650
Cracken found himself having a minor problem.

180
00:10:00.950 --> 00:10:04.770
At some point in the late ninth or early 10th century gun born had been on his

181
00:10:04.771 --> 00:10:05.610
way to Iceland.

182
00:10:05.611 --> 00:10:10.290
When a giant storm blew up and sent him wildly off course at fair warning,

183
00:10:10.420 --> 00:10:11.131
giant storms,

184
00:10:11.131 --> 00:10:14.650
blowing random dudes of course is going to be something of a recurring theme due

185
00:10:14.651 --> 00:10:18.000
days, video. Anyway, went gun born storm at last died down.

186
00:10:18.020 --> 00:10:20.440
He SP a distant forbid coast.

187
00:10:20.920 --> 00:10:24.480
It was the first sighting of Greenland in European history over the Halloween

188
00:10:24.481 --> 00:10:28.520
decades, news of gun Born's bizarre adventure spread across Icelands.

189
00:10:28.521 --> 00:10:30.320
By the time Eric was sentenced to three years,

190
00:10:30.800 --> 00:10:33.120
aile the sighting of this distant land was widely known.

191
00:10:33.800 --> 00:10:37.670
So decided to go and explore it. And to be clear, this absolutely nuts.

192
00:10:37.850 --> 00:10:42.630
The Denmark straight separating Icelands in Greenland is a 700 mile death trap

193
00:10:43.110 --> 00:10:47.990
frequently clogged with ice and plagued with thick fogs and dreadful storms.

194
00:10:48.290 --> 00:10:50.790
And it's not like Eric had nowhere else to go. The pharaohs,

195
00:10:50.910 --> 00:10:52.150
the Shetlands Ireland, England,

196
00:10:52.220 --> 00:10:56.790
none of these places to the east and south of yet banned him, but for whatever.

197
00:10:57.380 --> 00:11:01.740
And Eric at his heart set on this mysterious Western land in the spring of 982,

198
00:11:01.980 --> 00:11:02.260
Eric,

199
00:11:02.260 --> 00:11:05.900
his family FRS and a small group of friends departed Iceland on a three year

200
00:11:05.901 --> 00:11:06.450
voyage,

201
00:11:06.450 --> 00:11:10.380
they traveled in a ship called an NA sail powered alternative to the classic

202
00:11:10.780 --> 00:11:12.740
north long ship that livestock traveled with him.

203
00:11:12.800 --> 00:11:16.100
It could have been the end of Erics. The last that anyone saw of him,

204
00:11:16.210 --> 00:11:20.090
instead it wounds up the ING is making the NA volume of the journey to

205
00:11:20.091 --> 00:11:24.650
Greenland's finally sighting lands near what we today call the Amal Ford.

206
00:11:24.790 --> 00:11:26.610
But because the approach was so blocked with ice,

207
00:11:26.850 --> 00:11:29.850
Eric was forced to follow the coastline all the way around the Island's Southern

208
00:11:30.070 --> 00:11:33.690
tip. What he saw on the Western coast was the best kind of shock.

209
00:11:33.830 --> 00:11:37.090
Unlike the east Greenland's Western coast is comparatively hospitable.

210
00:11:37.091 --> 00:11:39.680
There's more habitable land, easier approaches,

211
00:11:39.830 --> 00:11:43.280
less of a sense that the ocean actively wants to kill. You.

212
00:11:43.350 --> 00:11:44.720
It's been said for centuries,

213
00:11:45.040 --> 00:11:48.040
air gave Greenland its name as a piece of propaganda,

214
00:11:48.240 --> 00:11:51.920
a way of enticing settlers to this cold and remote place.

215
00:11:52.220 --> 00:11:55.600
But green is also a pretty fair description of that Western coast,

216
00:11:55.700 --> 00:11:58.720
for someone who just traversed 700 miles of frozen ocean,

217
00:11:58.740 --> 00:12:00.720
it looked like a ver paradise.

218
00:12:01.180 --> 00:12:04.480
The majority of Eric's first year was spent establishing a base at modern day

219
00:12:05.000 --> 00:12:08.360
Cassar circuit temperate islands that would soon become the focal points of

220
00:12:08.361 --> 00:12:10.520
Greenlands east settlement. As spring return,

221
00:12:10.720 --> 00:12:14.070
as team began seriously explor the unknown lands,

222
00:12:14.071 --> 00:12:16.910
taking trips further up the coast, driving deeper into the interior.

223
00:12:16.980 --> 00:12:20.110
What they found was a surprisingly inviting world.

224
00:12:20.200 --> 00:12:21.990
While inland was frozen Tundra,

225
00:12:22.190 --> 00:12:25.630
there was a good 20 to 30 miles of Arab land clutching the Western coast.

226
00:12:25.930 --> 00:12:29.310
The climate in these Fords was similar to icy. The soil was good to,

227
00:12:29.510 --> 00:12:31.270
or at least as good as could be expected,

228
00:12:31.770 --> 00:12:34.460
but while Eric had found a place capable of supporting life,

229
00:12:34.461 --> 00:12:36.060
he never found any other humans.

230
00:12:36.700 --> 00:12:40.060
Although indigenous peoples had previously settled this part of Greenlands by

231
00:12:40.190 --> 00:12:43.260
Erics time, all their colonies had been long abandoned.

232
00:12:43.330 --> 00:12:46.620
This wasn't an occupied place that colonists would've had to fight for.

233
00:12:46.680 --> 00:12:50.620
It was truly virgining lambs, right? For the taking in 985,

234
00:12:50.690 --> 00:12:53.460
Eric designed to do just that, that summer, he,

235
00:12:53.730 --> 00:12:55.650
he took his boat and turned to Iceland,

236
00:12:55.750 --> 00:12:59.530
but it wasn't settling back into his old life that was on Eric's minds. No,

237
00:12:59.810 --> 00:13:02.970
he liked what he'd seen of. Greenland's likes the climate, the vegetation,

238
00:13:02.990 --> 00:13:05.530
the open space. Most of all had liked the freedom,

239
00:13:05.710 --> 00:13:10.170
the freedom to be someone important away from all these annoying laws about not

240
00:13:10.171 --> 00:13:12.250
killing your neighbors. As he sailed away,

241
00:13:12.530 --> 00:13:16.480
Eric explore that he had returned to Greenland and this time he'd bring enough

242
00:13:16.481 --> 00:13:18.400
people with him to make it permanence.

243
00:13:24.410 --> 00:13:28.440
While the name Greenlands might not have been pure marketing. There's no doubt.

244
00:13:28.441 --> 00:13:32.520
Eric sold his new colony, like a PR master back in Iceland.

245
00:13:32.521 --> 00:13:34.080
He told everyone who'd listened guys.

246
00:13:34.150 --> 00:13:39.110
Have I ever got a great investment idea for you before installing the

247
00:13:39.111 --> 00:13:41.110
Island's ease of living? It was a long shot pitch.

248
00:13:41.220 --> 00:13:45.150
Shop sticks with me and move 700 miles across dangerous ocean. But for many,

249
00:13:45.151 --> 00:13:47.270
it was also supremely tempting.

250
00:13:47.510 --> 00:13:51.070
Remember the Iceland soil is in decline at this stage. Life is getting harder.

251
00:13:51.270 --> 00:13:55.820
The hard enough to convince hundreds of people to roll everything on flame

252
00:13:56.340 --> 00:13:58.980
head explorers, mad gamble. Finally,

253
00:13:59.170 --> 00:14:02.900
some 14 to 15 winters before Christianity came to Icelands.

254
00:14:02.901 --> 00:14:07.900
The sagas say that Eric was ready that year, anywhere between 25 and 35 ships.

255
00:14:07.901 --> 00:14:11.940
The number varies depending on the source cast off into the frozen seas.

256
00:14:12.080 --> 00:14:15.460
For those of us used to hearing about the colonization of the Americas, the,

257
00:14:16.210 --> 00:14:20.050
to note an ever increasing mass of people that eventually just dominates

258
00:14:20.060 --> 00:14:20.893
everything.

259
00:14:20.990 --> 00:14:25.330
But the north experience in Greenlands was totally different at its absolute

260
00:14:25.331 --> 00:14:26.970
height. Long after Eric's death.

261
00:14:26.971 --> 00:14:30.610
It's estimated that the island was home to slightly over 2,500 people,

262
00:14:31.040 --> 00:14:35.010
tiny fraction of the number living on Iceland in Eric's time.

263
00:14:35.011 --> 00:14:38.960
The number was even his Greenlands consisted of maybe 350 people,

264
00:14:38.990 --> 00:14:43.880
plus a whole bunch of livestock clinging to a tiny temperate zone on

265
00:14:43.881 --> 00:14:47.640
the edge of a frozen wastelands colonists. Soon divided into two settlements.

266
00:14:47.641 --> 00:14:49.320
The Eastern settlement centered arounds,

267
00:14:49.321 --> 00:14:53.880
the Ford Eric had first occupied during exact Zile and the smaller Western S

268
00:14:53.881 --> 00:14:58.160
settlement 240 miles north between the two tiny Hamlet sprang up a little more

269
00:14:58.161 --> 00:15:00.720
than lone farms, deads, dotted along the coast.

270
00:15:01.080 --> 00:15:05.400
Yet it would be a mistake to think farming was all the Greenland colonists did

271
00:15:05.410 --> 00:15:07.840
while agriculture was an important part of their lives.

272
00:15:07.980 --> 00:15:11.710
One which saw them push medieval farming to its limits in such high latitudes.

273
00:15:11.890 --> 00:15:13.630
It certainly couldn't sustain them.

274
00:15:13.690 --> 00:15:17.830
But one thing the growing season was brutally short for another samples show.

275
00:15:17.831 --> 00:15:22.190
It probably took colonists a whole generation to adapt to the SAR conditions.

276
00:15:22.410 --> 00:15:26.270
So how did they survive in this inhospitable worlds for that?

277
00:15:26.330 --> 00:15:30.110
We need to look away from the land and to the water while it might not have

278
00:15:30.111 --> 00:15:33.780
trees. One thing green England does have an abundance is seals pretty much all

279
00:15:33.781 --> 00:15:38.140
excavations of old Greenland and middens or trash heaps have turned up seal

280
00:15:38.230 --> 00:15:38.581
bones,

281
00:15:38.581 --> 00:15:42.340
suggesting the colonists turn to hunting to supplement their diet from day one,

282
00:15:42.400 --> 00:15:44.420
but rather than just grabbing any passing seal,

283
00:15:44.570 --> 00:15:48.260
bashing its brains out and feasting on the BL the Greenlands did their hunting

284
00:15:48.660 --> 00:15:50.300
in a surprisingly sustainable way.

285
00:15:50.540 --> 00:15:52.850
Although Harbor seals.to the shores near their sediments,

286
00:15:52.851 --> 00:15:56.370
the colonists seemed to have realized they could easily hunt these creatures to

287
00:15:56.371 --> 00:16:00.410
extinction. So instead they targeted harp seals, which were harder to catch,

288
00:16:00.430 --> 00:16:02.090
but existed in far greater numbers,

289
00:16:02.091 --> 00:16:04.610
meaning their stock could be easily replenished.

290
00:16:04.790 --> 00:16:08.170
It was some savvy forward thinking one that runs counter to the popular image of

291
00:16:08.171 --> 00:16:11.970
Vikings as a bunch of drunk bearded slaughter machines, it also held Eric's new.

292
00:16:12.280 --> 00:16:16.000
You colony survive long term from the 350 odd first settlers.

293
00:16:16.001 --> 00:16:18.680
The Greenlands would quickly grow to number a thousand,

294
00:16:19.060 --> 00:16:22.320
but just establishing one major colony. Apparently wasn't enough Eric,

295
00:16:22.321 --> 00:16:23.360
within 15 years,

296
00:16:23.640 --> 00:16:27.760
it soon have a sight set even further west on a place that you and I know,

297
00:16:27.940 --> 00:16:30.240
not as Greenlands, but rather Canada.

298
00:16:37.310 --> 00:16:39.070
Remember back when that random zoo got blown off course.

299
00:16:39.071 --> 00:16:41.630
And we said it would become a theme in this video. Well,

300
00:16:41.820 --> 00:16:45.070
time to make good on that promise. In the early years of Eric's colony,

301
00:16:45.150 --> 00:16:49.630
a guy called Biani Hools set south Greenland only for surprise surprise a

302
00:16:49.631 --> 00:16:52.310
massive storm to blur off course when the winds died down,

303
00:16:52.330 --> 00:16:54.420
he and his group finally spotted lands,

304
00:16:54.421 --> 00:16:56.900
but not land any Europeans had ever seen before the coast,

305
00:16:56.901 --> 00:17:00.380
before them was heavily forested. Unlike Greenland's treeless Fords,

306
00:17:00.381 --> 00:17:01.700
it was such an unexpected site.

307
00:17:01.701 --> 00:17:04.980
The Bian refused to allow his men to land instead sailing up the coast,

308
00:17:05.420 --> 00:17:08.740
pasted another land mass covered in ice before bearing east and returning to

309
00:17:08.741 --> 00:17:09.820
Greenlands in doing so.

310
00:17:09.821 --> 00:17:13.460
He missed out on his Johns to become the first European to set foot in north and

311
00:17:13.570 --> 00:17:14.570
America today.

312
00:17:14.770 --> 00:17:18.650
It's thought the icy hellscape Bian saw was BAFF in islands while the forest and

313
00:17:18.710 --> 00:17:21.010
coasts were Newfoundlands and Labrador.

314
00:17:21.370 --> 00:17:23.170
How do he agree to let his men go ashore?

315
00:17:23.530 --> 00:17:26.970
Bani would probably now be starring in his own biographics instead of just

316
00:17:27.230 --> 00:17:29.650
saling in the corner of someone else's video,

317
00:17:29.940 --> 00:17:34.010
still his tale of yet another undiscovered world to the west sent shockwaves to

318
00:17:34.080 --> 00:17:37.760
through Eric's colony and planted a seed in its ruler mind.

319
00:17:37.940 --> 00:17:39.600
But before he could act on B's tip,

320
00:17:39.601 --> 00:17:42.160
Eric needed to get Greenland up and running by now,

321
00:17:42.161 --> 00:17:44.960
he was head of the Eastern settlement and living the life that has always

322
00:17:44.961 --> 00:17:49.440
dreamed of he had a large home authority and acted like he was Lord of all that

323
00:17:49.750 --> 00:17:52.720
heed, which we guess he technically was. However,

324
00:17:52.950 --> 00:17:56.440
that didn't mean that Eric was free to do whatever he pleased Bley might have

325
00:17:56.441 --> 00:17:57.400
been chief of Greenlands.

326
00:17:57.401 --> 00:18:00.440
There was still someone Eric needed to stay on the good side of,

327
00:18:00.620 --> 00:18:04.520
and that was the king of Norway while it was remote Greenland relied on trade

328
00:18:04.521 --> 00:18:08.440
with other north territories in order to survive the colonists at stuff like

329
00:18:08.910 --> 00:18:08.911
Ember,

330
00:18:08.911 --> 00:18:13.550
they desperately needed to import while they also boasted one important export

331
00:18:14.120 --> 00:18:14.650
ivory.

332
00:18:14.650 --> 00:18:18.350
At the time ivory artifacts were big business and with large herds of walrus

333
00:18:18.351 --> 00:18:21.550
sheltering in a bay 300 miles north of the Western settlement,

334
00:18:21.730 --> 00:18:23.590
the Greenlands could easily call the market,

335
00:18:23.990 --> 00:18:27.390
but opening a new trade ment keeping in the good graces of those back home

336
00:18:27.391 --> 00:18:32.380
around 994 at Eric dispatched his son LA to Norway under instructions to

337
00:18:32.381 --> 00:18:35.780
basically tell the king, Hey, the colony's doing great here. Some cool.

338
00:18:36.160 --> 00:18:38.740
Please do not invade us. King enough.

339
00:18:38.741 --> 00:18:43.140
Evidently liked what he heard because he agreed on one condition that LA tape

340
00:18:43.141 --> 00:18:47.700
Christianity back to Greenland with him as a new converter was determined to

341
00:18:48.140 --> 00:18:50.730
voice his religion on all Norseman everywhere.

342
00:18:51.010 --> 00:18:53.450
The Icelands would be converted around 999.

343
00:18:54.050 --> 00:18:56.330
OLF wanted to ensure Greenland's followed suit.

344
00:18:56.590 --> 00:18:59.450
So when Blake finally returned home around 1,080,

345
00:18:59.510 --> 00:19:02.930
it was supposedly with a priest at a side. We say supposedly,

346
00:19:02.931 --> 00:19:05.570
because there are some serious doubts that the Greenland has converted.

347
00:19:05.590 --> 00:19:09.770
So early one, commonly cited dates 10, 15 long after LA's journey to Norway.

348
00:19:09.970 --> 00:19:11.440
The that's not the story.

349
00:19:11.540 --> 00:19:15.760
The sagas tell in there telling they first convinced his mother sea hill to

350
00:19:15.900 --> 00:19:19.760
accept Christ before embarking on a journey all up and down the Western coast,

351
00:19:19.761 --> 00:19:23.440
converting the colonists with maybe one exception. Unlike thought hill.

352
00:19:23.470 --> 00:19:26.360
Eric found Christianity about his advertising as watching Sam one,

353
00:19:26.361 --> 00:19:30.280
blow their nose in public and then opened the tissue to examine its contents.

354
00:19:30.480 --> 00:19:32.510
In one version told in the saga of Eric,

355
00:19:32.530 --> 00:19:34.470
the red he held out for as long as possible,

356
00:19:34.540 --> 00:19:38.030
only being baptized long after everyone else in another,

357
00:19:38.050 --> 00:19:42.470
the version in the saga of the Greenlands, he went to his grave, stubborn pagan,

358
00:19:42.471 --> 00:19:44.950
having never accepted Christ. If the latter is true,

359
00:19:44.951 --> 00:19:48.550
it may well be because Eric had something else on his mind in a thousand day,

360
00:19:48.551 --> 00:19:51.700
deep around the same time later returns. He now to his father,

361
00:19:52.020 --> 00:19:53.580
that it had a grand's new idea.

362
00:19:53.680 --> 00:19:58.100
The two of them would sail west and settle that new land mass that hay

363
00:19:58.700 --> 00:19:59.740
had discovered together.

364
00:19:59.741 --> 00:20:02.940
They'd be the first Europeans in history to set foot in north America

365
00:20:09.280 --> 00:20:11.460
In the ends. Eric, the red just missed out on his,

366
00:20:11.770 --> 00:20:14.970
wants to make history for the second time refusing to accompany his son on the

367
00:20:14.971 --> 00:20:17.690
voyage west as with so much in today's tale,

368
00:20:17.750 --> 00:20:20.010
the reasons are frustratingly vague.

369
00:20:20.310 --> 00:20:23.050
One reason has it that Eric decided he was just too old.

370
00:20:23.051 --> 00:20:27.130
Another that he decided to go and change his mind when he spotted bad Oman's in

371
00:20:27.131 --> 00:20:30.090
another, he fell from a horse and injured himself on the day of departure,

372
00:20:30.091 --> 00:20:31.690
forcing him to abandon the voyage.

373
00:20:32.100 --> 00:20:35.240
The reason when LA set sail the head of 35 men,

374
00:20:35.720 --> 00:20:38.240
Eric wasn't by his side for such a famous Explorer.

375
00:20:38.510 --> 00:20:41.240
This must have seemed like a tragedy on his own history,

376
00:20:41.360 --> 00:20:44.040
changing voyage Lakewood first land on BAFF in Ireland,

377
00:20:44.160 --> 00:20:47.160
followed by heading south to overwind in Newfoundland,

378
00:20:47.300 --> 00:20:51.920
the settlements he established there is known today as LA Medo and it

379
00:20:51.921 --> 00:20:54.920
signifies the beginning of a great chapter in north history.

380
00:20:54.980 --> 00:20:58.520
One which saw them set up the first European colonies in America.

381
00:20:58.820 --> 00:21:02.080
But that's a tale for another time back in Greenlands and epidemic had broken

382
00:21:02.100 --> 00:21:04.200
out among the colonists killing hundreds.

383
00:21:04.560 --> 00:21:06.790
Although at least one saga says he survived. Eric.

384
00:21:07.030 --> 00:21:10.350
The red is traditionally thought to have died in the outbreak around the year

385
00:21:10.410 --> 00:21:11.350
1001,

386
00:21:11.351 --> 00:21:14.790
whether he lived long enough to see his son again and hear tales of the strange

387
00:21:14.890 --> 00:21:18.670
new land depends on which saga you read, whatever the truth of his death.

388
00:21:18.671 --> 00:21:21.910
There's no doubting what Eric left behind. Despite the epidemic,

389
00:21:22.310 --> 00:21:24.990
the Greenland colony was thriving far from being a frozen failure.

390
00:21:25.010 --> 00:21:29.060
It was attracting scores of new saddle is every year drawn by the promise of

391
00:21:29.090 --> 00:21:31.580
land freedom and riches. In fact,

392
00:21:31.600 --> 00:21:34.700
the Greenlands colony would become so rich that according to a surviving

393
00:21:34.900 --> 00:21:36.100
document from 1327,

394
00:21:36.101 --> 00:21:40.700
it was soon producing more profit from ivory than all 4,000 Icelandic farms

395
00:21:40.701 --> 00:21:43.100
could produce together. The date of that document too,

396
00:21:43.180 --> 00:21:46.420
you should tell you something of Greenland's fate while LA's American colony

397
00:21:46.421 --> 00:21:47.970
would last only a few winters.

398
00:21:48.210 --> 00:21:50.570
North Greenland soon became a simple fact of geography.

399
00:21:50.750 --> 00:21:54.530
The last known communication from the colony arrived in Iceland in 1424,

400
00:21:54.531 --> 00:21:56.610
over four centuries after Eric's death,

401
00:21:56.630 --> 00:22:00.450
in case he needed a reminding the United States so far survived for a little

402
00:22:00.480 --> 00:22:03.570
over half that time, say what you like about Eric, the reds,

403
00:22:03.571 --> 00:22:06.290
but he knew how to build a colony. That would last of course,

404
00:22:06.291 --> 00:22:10.000
the Greenland settlements eventually laid out or were abandoned for reasons.

405
00:22:10.001 --> 00:22:13.560
We're still not totally sure of the last evidence of any activity dates to

406
00:22:13.561 --> 00:22:17.920
around 1450. After that, it would be another 300 years before Scandinavians.

407
00:22:17.921 --> 00:22:20.360
Again, return to the frozen land today. Eric,

408
00:22:20.560 --> 00:22:22.920
the reds lost his mantle as the founder of Greenlands.

409
00:22:22.921 --> 00:22:26.160
While the Amy bestowed upon the islands survives modern inhabitants were almost

410
00:22:26.270 --> 00:22:29.230
uniformly of Inuit descent, the Norse,

411
00:22:29.410 --> 00:22:33.150
yet none of this detracts from his greatest achievement at a time when the

412
00:22:33.310 --> 00:22:36.110
universe seemed to firmly star at Iceland's Western edge,

413
00:22:36.420 --> 00:22:40.510
Eric rolled everything on a perilous voyage to an UN unknown land that he didn't

414
00:22:40.511 --> 00:22:41.344
just survive,

415
00:22:41.410 --> 00:22:45.590
but managed to establish a long lived colony is all sorts of admirable.

416
00:22:45.730 --> 00:22:49.700
We may know little about his inner life today, or even what, what drove him.

417
00:22:49.760 --> 00:22:51.060
But we do know that Eric,

418
00:22:51.080 --> 00:22:55.700
the red was one of the era's most accomplished and most fascinating explorers

419
00:22:55.800 --> 00:22:59.420
for that reason, if no other he's worthy of being remembered.

420
00:22:59.720 --> 00:23:01.620
