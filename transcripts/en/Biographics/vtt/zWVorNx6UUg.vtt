5
00:00:19.640 --> 00:00:23.510
He's perhaps the most, I figure in German history at the moment, Frederick II,

6
00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:24.790
better known as Frederick.

7
00:00:24.930 --> 00:00:29.870
The great ascend to the throne in 1740 PR was a discontinuous

8
00:00:29.871 --> 00:00:33.150
scrap of a state sandwich between far more powerful rivals.

9
00:00:33.290 --> 00:00:37.310
By the time he died in 1786, Berlin's fortunes had been changed forever.

10
00:00:37.490 --> 00:00:38.323
It was under Frederick,

11
00:00:38.990 --> 00:00:43.460
the PRS rose to the status of great European power that the

12
00:00:43.461 --> 00:00:47.580
foundations were laid for its vital future role in unifying Germany.

13
00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:51.500
It was also at the King's court that the idea of an enlightenment ruler was

14
00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:55.980
realized an absolute auto crash who used his power, not for tyranny,

15
00:00:56.320 --> 00:00:57.820
but for tolerance yet,

16
00:00:57.821 --> 00:01:01.220
while it's Frederick's career in war and state building that's remembered today,

17
00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:06.170
there was so much more to crush his greatest king than mere gungho

18
00:01:06.490 --> 00:01:07.170
nationalism.

19
00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:08.010
<v 1>A man of immense culture.</v>

20
00:01:08.011 --> 00:01:11.570
Frederick transforms the faces of cities like Berlin and Potsdam.

21
00:01:11.830 --> 00:01:15.810
He patronized France's greatest writers provided a safe Harbor for Europe's

22
00:01:15.811 --> 00:01:20.090
atheists and ushered through reforms that shook the continent beloved and

23
00:01:20.091 --> 00:01:24.200
despised an equal measure by his temporaries. This is the story of pressures,

24
00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:25.760
unlikely philosopher king.

25
00:01:31.910 --> 00:01:34.920
<v 0>Because of the major role it later played in unifying Germany.</v>

26
00:01:35.110 --> 00:01:38.320
Most of us today think of pressure as an important state,

27
00:01:38.420 --> 00:01:40.440
but this wasn't always true. Although I at Frederick,

28
00:01:40.580 --> 00:01:43.470
the great was born on January the 24 or 17, 12.

29
00:01:43.471 --> 00:01:48.110
Nobody would've dreamed of calling pressure a great European power Berlin's

30
00:01:48.230 --> 00:01:53.190
territory was sort of halfway grounds between Amir electorate and a minor state,

31
00:01:53.830 --> 00:01:56.750
her Maite and Frederick's owned colorful phrasing.

32
00:01:56.940 --> 00:02:00.870
When his father Frederick William, the first assumed power in 17, 13,

33
00:02:01.050 --> 00:02:03.580
he was only the second king Prusa had ever had.

34
00:02:03.590 --> 00:02:05.540
<v 1>Prior to that, it had nearly been a Dutch sheet,</v>

35
00:02:05.590 --> 00:02:09.300
still pressure's motor role didn't stop Frederick William from thinking big,

36
00:02:09.860 --> 00:02:10.260
of course,

37
00:02:10.260 --> 00:02:13.700
military man Frederick William was convinced that his state's future lay in

38
00:02:13.900 --> 00:02:18.180
building up the army and turning his eldest son into a warrior while this

39
00:02:18.181 --> 00:02:19.740
prediction would turn out to be right.

40
00:02:19.760 --> 00:02:23.970
<v 0>It would also be the cause of all of his sons suffering until the age of seven</v>

41
00:02:23.971 --> 00:02:24.690
Frederick.

42
00:02:24.690 --> 00:02:28.890
That seemed to be great was raised by his mother alongside his sister will

43
00:02:29.330 --> 00:02:31.010
Hellina. It was most unhappy time.

44
00:02:31.110 --> 00:02:34.210
The female court was full of intrigue and back biting young Frederick could

45
00:02:34.211 --> 00:02:36.490
barely understand to cope with the tension in the air.

46
00:02:36.510 --> 00:02:39.490
He and Willhelm retreated together into fantasy worlds,

47
00:02:39.690 --> 00:02:43.170
becoming obsessed with music and literature obsessions that would stay with

48
00:02:43.370 --> 00:02:47.000
Frederick all his life. But if the young boy thought life with mummy was tough.

49
00:02:47.110 --> 00:02:51.080
Wait until he started spending time with dad. When the boy turned seven,

50
00:02:51.180 --> 00:02:54.680
he was yanked away and placed in the care of his tyrannical father.

51
00:02:55.160 --> 00:03:00.080
And trust us, the a tyrannical is probably underselling it a little Frederick.

52
00:03:00.081 --> 00:03:02.040
William was of the old school,

53
00:03:02.720 --> 00:03:05.160
spare the rod and spoil the child mentality.

54
00:03:05.300 --> 00:03:09.320
He took it upon himself to beat his, a feminine music, loving son into shape.

55
00:03:09.740 --> 00:03:13.200
And we mean that literally Frederick was publicly humiliated by his father.

56
00:03:13.340 --> 00:03:17.360
Beaten, bullied told to commit suicide. It was day in, day out,

57
00:03:17.361 --> 00:03:19.870
torment designed do crush the boy's spirit.

58
00:03:20.130 --> 00:03:22.750
He wanted to toughen him up and turn him into a soldier.

59
00:03:23.060 --> 00:03:26.750
Instead it very nearly drove him away in 1730 while serving in the army

60
00:03:27.110 --> 00:03:31.790
Frederick decided to flee pressure. He took along his best friend Han Armon VCA.

61
00:03:32.390 --> 00:03:35.590
Although there are plenty who think that kata was more than just a BFF

62
00:03:35.591 --> 00:03:37.030
throughout his life. Frederick,

63
00:03:37.170 --> 00:03:40.460
the great would show a marked preference from men surrounding himself with

64
00:03:40.461 --> 00:03:44.100
strapping young lads and having his palaces filled with paintings of beautiful

65
00:03:44.101 --> 00:03:47.460
boys. Almost historians would hesitate to definitively call him.

66
00:03:47.780 --> 00:03:51.700
There's plenty of circumstantial evidence from the medallions he had made as

67
00:03:51.701 --> 00:03:56.100
king depicting ancient male lovers to the poem. He wrote declaring the disciple.

68
00:03:56.130 --> 00:03:58.740
John shed a bit of sexy time with Jesus,

69
00:03:59.160 --> 00:04:02.970
nor is this just a modern interpretation Frederick's own father called him a

70
00:04:03.090 --> 00:04:04.450
feminist and a sodomite,

71
00:04:04.570 --> 00:04:09.130
a description enemy propaganda would pick up on and run with. So yeah,

72
00:04:09.131 --> 00:04:10.250
there's a good chance. Frederick.

73
00:04:10.390 --> 00:04:13.570
The great was at least by romantic and probably gay,

74
00:04:13.571 --> 00:04:15.890
which makes what happens to Han Amond.

75
00:04:16.530 --> 00:04:19.090
Vanatta all the more tragic before their escape attempts.

76
00:04:19.130 --> 00:04:21.480
It even got off the ground. The two young men were arrested.

77
00:04:21.481 --> 00:04:25.360
Frederick was told that his father was going to have him executed for desertion

78
00:04:25.361 --> 00:04:28.120
while the old Tyrons eventually showed leniency.

79
00:04:28.260 --> 00:04:31.680
The same couldn't be said of poor on cardiac on November the sixth,

80
00:04:32.040 --> 00:04:33.480
1730 KA was behead.

81
00:04:33.481 --> 00:04:37.880
Frederick William forced his son to watch the execution through a window in the

82
00:04:37.881 --> 00:04:40.830
aftermath. The young man collapsed weeping to the round.

83
00:04:41.050 --> 00:04:45.150
It was a sadistic demonstration of Frederick's helplessness of his father's

84
00:04:45.250 --> 00:04:49.390
brutal hold over him. Luckily his awful dad wouldn't be around for much longer.

85
00:04:55.810 --> 00:04:59.110
The years following VA county's murders or Frederick William tried to force his

86
00:04:59.111 --> 00:05:02.070
son into something resembling a regular life. In 1733,

87
00:05:02.320 --> 00:05:04.980
he was married to Elizabeth, Christine of Brunswick,

88
00:05:05.150 --> 00:05:09.660
Bevin who Frederick described as a sour subspecies of the female

89
00:05:10.050 --> 00:05:13.420
sect and spent most of his life trying to avoid her. One year later,

90
00:05:13.520 --> 00:05:16.340
he earned his stripes on the battlefield facing off against the French army

91
00:05:16.341 --> 00:05:17.500
under an Austrian general.

92
00:05:17.800 --> 00:05:21.580
Yet Frederick kicked back against this unwanted life refusing to be the man,

93
00:05:21.920 --> 00:05:26.330
his father, to old him to be, he adopted a slightly Fay refined personality.

94
00:05:26.500 --> 00:05:28.690
Spent his time reading French literature.

95
00:05:28.750 --> 00:05:33.450
He even became an about non-believer spitting in the eye of his father's strict

96
00:05:33.451 --> 00:05:37.170
Calvinist face yet for all. He tried to differentiate himself from his father.

97
00:05:37.171 --> 00:05:40.130
Something of the old man must rubbed off already.

98
00:05:40.131 --> 00:05:43.360
Frederick was adopting his father's bullying ways towards his young younger

99
00:05:43.361 --> 00:05:48.080
brother, the openly homosexual prince Henry, as well as his last family life.

100
00:05:48.260 --> 00:05:53.160
It was that same old sad story of growing up to become everything you hated

101
00:05:53.330 --> 00:05:56.280
about your own parents. Thankfully though, Frederick William.

102
00:05:56.400 --> 00:06:00.840
I first wouldn't get to see it. The king of PR died on the 31st of May, 1740.

103
00:06:00.950 --> 00:06:05.680
Exactly what Frederick the great felt when he got the news has been lost a time,

104
00:06:05.820 --> 00:06:09.880
but we are guessing it had more than a touch of party. Time to it.

105
00:06:10.060 --> 00:06:11.640
During his coronation journey,

106
00:06:11.780 --> 00:06:14.720
he allowed his attractive young ballet as it alongside him,

107
00:06:14.780 --> 00:06:17.990
openly treating the boy like Royal mistres nor was Frederick.

108
00:06:18.090 --> 00:06:21.350
The only one to feel released by his father's death among the PR and

109
00:06:21.351 --> 00:06:22.190
intellectual class.

110
00:06:22.191 --> 00:06:25.150
There was a strong feeling that Frederick was exactly the sort ruler that they

111
00:06:25.151 --> 00:06:27.590
needed. It was known that the new king was cultured,

112
00:06:27.750 --> 00:06:32.070
a flute player who loved architecture in the arts after the military PPO of

113
00:06:32.071 --> 00:06:32.740
Frederick William,

114
00:06:32.740 --> 00:06:37.380
they had reasoned to hope that Frederick the great would usher in naira peace

115
00:06:37.381 --> 00:06:38.820
and culture as turned out,

116
00:06:38.950 --> 00:06:43.060
those hopes would only be halfway fulfilled along with everything else.

117
00:06:43.300 --> 00:06:43.400
Frederick,

118
00:06:43.400 --> 00:06:48.260
the great had inherited his father's vast and well trained army and fate was

119
00:06:48.261 --> 00:06:51.740
about to hand him the perfect opportunity for using them over in Austria.

120
00:06:51.960 --> 00:06:55.140
The holy room in Ember, Charles, the six was dying at this time.

121
00:06:55.141 --> 00:06:59.130
Austria under the Hapsburg was the premier German speaking power in Europe

122
00:06:59.890 --> 00:07:03.490
later, Hoen wearing Goliath next to PRS scrappy. David,

123
00:07:03.491 --> 00:07:08.130
unfortunately for Habsburg law said only male relatives could inherit the

124
00:07:08.131 --> 00:07:10.690
throne. This was unfortunate because Charles was dying.

125
00:07:10.691 --> 00:07:12.010
Having had only a daughter,

126
00:07:12.570 --> 00:07:15.850
although Charles had spent years trying to convince Europe to recognize Maria

127
00:07:16.210 --> 00:07:17.490
Teresa as his legitimate air.

128
00:07:17.710 --> 00:07:22.080
The other powers were far more interested in carving up her territory with the

129
00:07:22.081 --> 00:07:25.480
whole of Europe, sharpening it swords the moments Charles kicked the bucket.

130
00:07:25.481 --> 00:07:29.320
Frederick realized that he was facing a do or die moment,

131
00:07:29.690 --> 00:07:34.240
right on precious border sat the Habsburg region of Silesia an area so

132
00:07:34.241 --> 00:07:38.240
wealthy. It supplied a quarter of the entire Austrian.

133
00:07:38.550 --> 00:07:43.390
It unfortunately, Silesia also bordered right on Saxony and electorate.

134
00:07:43.610 --> 00:07:46.990
At least as powerful as Prussia Frederick could play things safe.

135
00:07:47.170 --> 00:07:48.390
Be the cultured king.

136
00:07:48.610 --> 00:07:53.510
His subjects wanted him to be and watch Saxony absorb Silesia or he could become

137
00:07:53.511 --> 00:07:57.790
the great military man. His father had dreamed of and take the region himself.

138
00:07:57.820 --> 00:08:02.060
Charles, the sixth died on October the 20th, 1740, less than two months later,

139
00:08:02.061 --> 00:08:05.780
Frederick marched 80,000 troops into Silesia.

140
00:08:06.000 --> 00:08:10.900
It was the start of the war of Austrian succession war that would reshape

141
00:08:10.901 --> 00:08:11.820
central Europe.

142
00:08:12.080 --> 00:08:16.180
It was also the war that would finally earn Frederick the Appalachian. Great.

143
00:08:16.620 --> 00:08:21.490
And you know what else is great. Today's video a Nord VPN. Now more than ever.

144
00:08:21.640 --> 00:08:25.250
It's critical to be able to use the internet safely and securely.

145
00:08:25.300 --> 00:08:30.050
We've talked about the benefits of VPNs before. This is not 1999,

146
00:08:30.150 --> 00:08:33.490
too many people are looking here, internet history, bad actors,

147
00:08:33.491 --> 00:08:35.530
trying to steal your data and personal information.

148
00:08:35.530 --> 00:08:40.010
Corporations tracking your browsing activity and bombarding you with ads who do

00:08:40.320 --> 00:08:43.240
needs. Any of that. I'll tell you probably not you.

150

but they're not just for protecting yourselves.

153

00:09:36.220 --> 00:09:37.220
And let's get back to Fred.

167
00:09:43.740 --> 00:09:46.980
Considering he's literally called the great Frederick's early attempts at warm

168
00:09:47.460 --> 00:09:51.540
hungering were more Laurel and Hardy than Napoleon Bonna part during the first

169
00:09:51.541 --> 00:09:54.140
major Austrian encounter attack of 1741,

170
00:09:54.580 --> 00:09:56.970
Frederick got so power that he fled the battlefield,

171
00:09:57.140 --> 00:10:00.330
tried to hide and came this close to being captured.

172
00:10:00.510 --> 00:10:03.650
It was only thanks to his generals that the tide was turned and the battle

173
00:10:03.670 --> 00:10:05.010
became a PRUs and victory.

174
00:10:05.110 --> 00:10:08.770
You won't be surprised to hear that this little misadventure was conspicuously

175
00:10:08.771 --> 00:10:10.610
left out of the official narrative,

176
00:10:10.750 --> 00:10:15.210
but even for Frederick to get this far required a massive stroke of luck at the

177
00:10:15.211 --> 00:10:17.920
time, Austria allied with Russia. And there was a real chance.

178
00:10:18.240 --> 00:10:22.640
1741 could have dawned with the Russian bear stomping into pressure and doing

179
00:10:22.920 --> 00:10:26.080
too Berlin. What Yogi bear does do picnic baskets.

180
00:10:27.020 --> 00:10:31.560
It was only by sheer luck that Russia was destabilized by dynastic shenanigans

181
00:10:31.561 --> 00:10:34.400
that kept St Petersburg out of the fight yet,

182
00:10:34.600 --> 00:10:37.390
while Frederick was undeniably lucky at the, a start of the war,

183
00:10:37.580 --> 00:10:41.350
it's what he did with those lucky breaks that made him so impressive.

184
00:10:41.750 --> 00:10:44.270
Although she'd keep trying for almost her entire reign,

185
00:10:44.271 --> 00:10:46.710
Maria therea would never get Silesia back.

186
00:10:46.930 --> 00:10:51.430
The thing was that Frederick was just a master at knowing when to apply pressure

187
00:10:51.490 --> 00:10:54.750
during 1742, he staged an invasion of Moravia,

188
00:10:54.850 --> 00:10:56.630
not because he wanted to conquer it,

189
00:10:56.730 --> 00:11:01.340
but because he knew Maria therea would be too busy, fighting Saxony, Bavaria,

190
00:11:01.680 --> 00:11:05.500
and France to do anything but grants him a peace treaty. Two years later,

191
00:11:05.610 --> 00:11:07.340
when the tide was turning in Austria's favor,

192
00:11:07.400 --> 00:11:10.740
he invaded Bohemia just to stop Maria Theresa from gaining the advantage.

193
00:11:11.010 --> 00:11:13.220
This wasn't great leadership in the Napoleon.

194
00:11:13.380 --> 00:11:16.300
Mold conquering everything in sight with superior ability,

195
00:11:16.400 --> 00:11:19.890
but it was realistic leadership with a targeted goal,

196
00:11:20.200 --> 00:11:22.530
keep Silesia and in real life,

197
00:11:22.531 --> 00:11:27.450
that's usually way more successful than going for broke. On Christmas day, 1745.

198
00:11:27.690 --> 00:11:31.130
Frederick finally reached a long term settlement with Austria in return for

199
00:11:31.250 --> 00:11:32.410
pressure withdraw from the war.

200
00:11:32.590 --> 00:11:35.810
The piece of Dresden basically gave Frederick everything he wanted.

201
00:11:36.150 --> 00:11:40.440
He returns to Berlin that same year was hailed for the first time as Frederick

202
00:11:40.580 --> 00:11:44.640
the crate pressure reddened this war as the new kids, the scrawny young boy,

203
00:11:44.690 --> 00:11:46.880
going up against the biggest kid in the playground,

204
00:11:46.881 --> 00:11:49.800
Austria and making him and over his lunch money.

205
00:11:50.120 --> 00:11:53.880
But the war of Austrian succession would end with Maria Teresa laying the smack

206
00:11:53.950 --> 00:11:58.280
down on most of her opponents, Russia would walk away with its head held high.

207
00:11:58.350 --> 00:12:02.640
Clearly Vienna was no longer the only German speaking great power on the

208
00:12:02.641 --> 00:12:06.360
consonants. Still the Silesia issue would rear its ugly head. Again,

209
00:12:06.590 --> 00:12:08.960
just a decade later this time amid war.

210
00:12:09.100 --> 00:12:14.030
So big Winston Churchill would later call it the real first world war.

211
00:12:14.290 --> 00:12:17.550
But for now we're going to step away from all of the fighting and the killing

212
00:12:17.850 --> 00:12:20.230
and head back to newly confident Berlin.

213
00:12:20.660 --> 00:12:25.310
It's time to see if pressure's new king can handle peace time as well as he

214
00:12:25.311 --> 00:12:26.144
could. War time.

215
00:12:32.670 --> 00:12:37.380
The, in which Frederick rules was the era of enlightened despotism in Europe,

216
00:12:37.610 --> 00:12:40.180
over in Austria, Maria therea was building hospitals,

217
00:12:40.181 --> 00:12:44.540
providing universal education and professionalizing her civil service up in

218
00:12:44.541 --> 00:12:47.900
Russia, Catherine, the great which soon be promoting women's education,

219
00:12:47.901 --> 00:12:52.060
forcing land owners to treat their surfs like actual humans and mapping her

220
00:12:52.061 --> 00:12:53.380
great em empire. But for many,

221
00:12:53.790 --> 00:12:55.930
the greatest of these forward thinking monarchs was Frederick.

222
00:12:56.290 --> 00:13:00.650
The great to be clear. This is forward thinking in 18th century terms,

223
00:13:01.130 --> 00:13:02.650
Frederick was by no means liberal.

224
00:13:02.910 --> 00:13:06.730
He practiced political censorship and ruled by absolute decree. Still.

225
00:13:06.950 --> 00:13:10.970
He was at the forefront of this new wave of rulers promoting culture and

226
00:13:10.971 --> 00:13:13.050
tolerance. So let's start with tolerance.

227
00:13:13.450 --> 00:13:17.000
Remember earlier how Frederick became a nonbeliever almost despite his father,

228
00:13:17.170 --> 00:13:21.480
while that non-belief would turn his pressure into a bastion for free thinking.

229
00:13:22.000 --> 00:13:25.800
Frederick hated superstition and felt the religion should be the subject to the

230
00:13:25.801 --> 00:13:28.400
same questioning as other systems accordingly.

231
00:13:28.400 --> 00:13:32.240
He allowed both Catholicism and Protestantism and his kingdom and encouraged

232
00:13:32.241 --> 00:13:35.790
scientific debate of both faiths. This being the 18th century,

233
00:13:35.980 --> 00:13:38.750
that tolerance didn't really extend towards pressures.

234
00:13:38.980 --> 00:13:43.470
Jews who Frederick regarded with suspicion at best atheists though were another

235
00:13:43.471 --> 00:13:43.671
matter.

236
00:13:43.671 --> 00:13:48.110
Frederick prided himself on offering a safe Haven to heretics that went beyond

237
00:13:48.340 --> 00:13:50.550
even what could be found in England beyond religion.

238
00:13:51.030 --> 00:13:53.750
Frederick also offered shelter to some of the most freethinking minds of his

239
00:13:53.910 --> 00:13:55.700
era, chief among them Aire.

240
00:13:55.920 --> 00:13:59.260
One of Europe's greatest writers and philosophers Aire was the 18th century

241
00:13:59.261 --> 00:14:01.980
equivalent of a superstar as early as the 1730s,

242
00:14:01.981 --> 00:14:05.380
when he was still just a young prince Frederick had been exchanging letters with

243
00:14:05.381 --> 00:14:06.700
the great thinker. Admittedly,

244
00:14:06.701 --> 00:14:10.860
these letters had been full of the two of them sucking up to each other in the

245
00:14:10.861 --> 00:14:14.460
most embarrassing of ways like Voltaire responding to a potential meeting by

246
00:14:14.461 --> 00:14:17.890
writing I Soho to faint from joy,

247
00:14:18.340 --> 00:14:22.330
still their correspondence reflects Frederick's genuine desire to be an

248
00:14:22.331 --> 00:14:26.050
enlightened ruler as well as a man of international tastes.

249
00:14:26.050 --> 00:14:28.290
Frederick got Volter to help him with his French,

250
00:14:28.320 --> 00:14:32.290
even going so far as to descend him poems to edit not the Aire seems to have

251
00:14:32.291 --> 00:14:36.880
thought much of Frederick's literary pros in 70 53 during a mul year stay at

252
00:14:36.881 --> 00:14:37.714
Frederick's court.

253
00:14:38.200 --> 00:14:42.680
Voltaire received a stack of the King's poems by SI and declaring will the king

254
00:14:42.850 --> 00:14:47.200
never tire of giving me his dirty laundry to wash still.

255
00:14:47.201 --> 00:14:51.000
There was more to Frederick the great than simply advocating a degree of

256
00:14:51.080 --> 00:14:52.800
intellectual freedom under his watch.

257
00:14:53.240 --> 00:14:55.720
The cities of Berlin and Potsdam were given makeovers,

258
00:14:55.721 --> 00:14:58.400
transforming them into some of the most beautiful places in Europe.

259
00:14:59.010 --> 00:15:02.720
Pod's San sea palace, meaning carefree and French is in particular,

260
00:15:03.120 --> 00:15:04.320
an architectural masterpiece,

261
00:15:04.400 --> 00:15:07.800
a palace where Frederick could indulge in his childhood passion for music

262
00:15:08.200 --> 00:15:09.920
surrounded by handsome young men. In fact,

263
00:15:09.921 --> 00:15:14.190
it proved to be such a congenial setting that Frederick effectively moved his

264
00:15:14.191 --> 00:15:15.550
court there in 1748,

265
00:15:15.551 --> 00:15:19.790
abandoning his father's Berlin for a place of his own away from architecture.

266
00:15:19.790 --> 00:15:21.830
Frederick also supported culture in general,

267
00:15:21.831 --> 00:15:24.990
including extra funding for the Berlin academy. However,

268
00:15:25.250 --> 00:15:28.390
he was never quite the Bastian of Germanist later.

269
00:15:28.580 --> 00:15:32.620
Fans would try to paint him as ber Frank of to his core Frederick was just as

270
00:15:32.621 --> 00:15:37.100
likely to promote the latest writings from Paris as he was some groundbreaking

271
00:15:37.430 --> 00:15:40.380
prion opera still for most of his subjects, the reign of Frederick,

272
00:15:40.480 --> 00:15:42.060
the great was a good enough time.

273
00:15:42.080 --> 00:15:44.780
The time when the civil service became more professional,

274
00:15:44.840 --> 00:15:49.100
the judiciary more impartial and intellectual pursuits were considered just as

275
00:15:49.101 --> 00:15:52.650
important as dawning a uniform and shooting a foreigner.

276
00:15:52.750 --> 00:15:56.290
And yet Frederick would never quite shake off the military training.

277
00:15:56.590 --> 00:16:00.170
His father had forced on him as much as he might like to think of himself.

278
00:16:00.171 --> 00:16:04.450
As a philosopher king events were about to prove that Frederick was more of a

279
00:16:04.451 --> 00:16:06.450
warlord than he cared to let on

280
00:16:12.940 --> 00:16:15.480
By rights, the name world war I should belong,

281
00:16:15.620 --> 00:16:19.760
not to the European conflicts that raged from 1914 to 1918,

282
00:16:20.060 --> 00:16:23.880
but to a much earlier war kicking off in 1754 is so fighting,

283
00:16:24.020 --> 00:16:26.800
not just in Europe, but in north and south America, west Africa,

284
00:16:27.020 --> 00:16:31.800
and on the Indian subcontinent known as the seven years war or the French and

285
00:16:31.801 --> 00:16:32.634
Indian war in America,

286
00:16:33.090 --> 00:16:37.670
it was perhaps the biggest military conation the planet had yet seen.

287
00:16:37.730 --> 00:16:41.150
And one of its principle drivers would be Frederick great to bit.

288
00:16:41.270 --> 00:16:44.630
All the causes of the seven years war into context would take the rest of this

289
00:16:44.631 --> 00:16:45.090
video.

290
00:16:45.090 --> 00:16:48.350
But the shore version is that Britain and France were vying for power in the

291
00:16:48.351 --> 00:16:52.470
colonies. While a diplomatic revolution was transforming Europe's alliances.

292
00:16:52.471 --> 00:16:56.900
Russia for a example was becoming both increasingly anti-US and cozying up to

293
00:16:56.901 --> 00:16:57.600
great Britain.

294
00:16:57.600 --> 00:17:01.500
So when a colonial war kicked off between Paris and London in 1754,

295
00:17:01.501 --> 00:17:04.180
Frederick hastily promised Britain neutrality.

296
00:17:04.180 --> 00:17:06.540
Unfortunately he was meant to be allied to France.

297
00:17:06.640 --> 00:17:08.940
And when Louie the 15th found out,

298
00:17:09.240 --> 00:17:11.900
he was pretty by 1756,

299
00:17:11.901 --> 00:17:15.330
Frederick was convinced that while was no longer a threat, France,

300
00:17:15.350 --> 00:17:20.290
Russia and Austria were just weeks away from tag teaming him and snatching

301
00:17:20.291 --> 00:17:25.170
back Silesia. So he decided to do what had done the last time and attack.

302
00:17:25.180 --> 00:17:27.170
First in August of 1756,

303
00:17:27.171 --> 00:17:31.610
Frederick fired the opening gun on the war in Europe by invading Austria's

304
00:17:31.611 --> 00:17:33.930
allies Saxony in no time, it all had snatched,

305
00:17:34.640 --> 00:17:38.480
Dresden and lip Zig and carried on into Bohemia to LA siege Prague.

306
00:17:38.660 --> 00:17:42.640
And so began the second great war of Frederick's reign to say that it was a

307
00:17:42.641 --> 00:17:47.160
roller coaster ride would be to severely underestimate just how wildly precious

308
00:17:47.360 --> 00:17:50.360
fortunes rose and fell. Unlike pretty much all his enemies.

309
00:17:50.361 --> 00:17:53.600
Frederick personally led his army assisted by generals like his brother,

310
00:17:53.601 --> 00:17:58.520
prince Henry often this gave him a huge tactical advantage while other armies

311
00:17:58.521 --> 00:18:01.480
were hamstrung by needing to check actions with their capitals.

312
00:18:01.480 --> 00:18:04.880
Frederick could think on his feet making a policy at lightning speed.

313
00:18:05.020 --> 00:18:09.950
He also had a ruthless cunning streak that served him well at the battle of LUN

314
00:18:10.010 --> 00:18:11.070
in 1757,

315
00:18:11.071 --> 00:18:15.310
Frederick ran rings around his Austrian opponents so much so that Napoleon would

316
00:18:15.311 --> 00:18:17.990
later call him the greatest tactician in history.

317
00:18:18.170 --> 00:18:20.590
But despite the hype Frederick was known Napoleon,

318
00:18:20.730 --> 00:18:24.670
he was sly fast thinking and courageous. Sure, but he was also stubborn.

319
00:18:24.810 --> 00:18:27.550
And that occasionally led him to the brink of disaster.

320
00:18:27.770 --> 00:18:32.700
The 1759 bad of CO's doff almost ended Frederick's military career in the face

321
00:18:32.701 --> 00:18:36.020
of a joint Austrian Russian force. Frederick pushed too hard,

322
00:18:36.370 --> 00:18:40.620
lost the advantage and was forced to watch his army disintegrate into an

323
00:18:40.621 --> 00:18:45.380
undisciplined mess of the 50,000 or so many had started with only 3000,

324
00:18:45.490 --> 00:18:46.540
made it to the end of the battle.

325
00:18:46.800 --> 00:18:50.290
It was such a defeat that Frederick considered suicide. A year later,

326
00:18:50.350 --> 00:18:53.730
he suffered another blow when his enemies invaded and briefly occupied Berlin,

327
00:18:54.020 --> 00:18:58.530
still these setbacks were rare enough that by 1761 pressure was heading towards

328
00:18:58.531 --> 00:19:02.450
victory. Unfortunately, this was victory in the per sense,

329
00:19:02.550 --> 00:19:04.930
the seven years war had left pressure broke.

330
00:19:04.931 --> 00:19:08.170
Frederick was unable to pay his employees and it looked like there might be

331
00:19:08.280 --> 00:19:11.920
rioting if peace wasn sign. Soon as usual though,

332
00:19:12.520 --> 00:19:16.720
luck was on his side in May, 1762 SAR, Peter II came to the Russian throne,

333
00:19:16.960 --> 00:19:18.320
a massive Frederick fanboy.

334
00:19:18.340 --> 00:19:22.040
The new SAR ended some Petersburg's involvement in the war with a major ally

335
00:19:22.160 --> 00:19:26.240
dropping out Maria therea, reluctantly thrown the towel in February 70 63.

336
00:19:26.241 --> 00:19:30.480
The piece of Huber Berg ended pressure and Austria's two decades of waring of

337
00:19:30.790 --> 00:19:33.470
for Silesia for good. While the, to pressure had been massive.

338
00:19:33.471 --> 00:19:36.950
Frederick had made gains that went beyond mere finances.

339
00:19:37.510 --> 00:19:41.150
Prusa was now undeniably a great power, able to swipe land away from Austria,

340
00:19:41.560 --> 00:19:44.990
fight the Russians and forge game changing alliances with Britain.

341
00:19:45.430 --> 00:19:47.310
Although Frederick would be careful to never again,

342
00:19:47.311 --> 00:19:51.980
fight such a spectacular war. His international prestig went through the roof,

343
00:19:52.200 --> 00:19:56.340
but he still wasn't done. Pressure was still too disunited too vulnerable,

344
00:19:56.480 --> 00:19:59.580
too much of a hermaphrodite to be truly secure.

345
00:19:59.880 --> 00:20:04.300
It would take one more major change for Frederick's legacy to be complete.

346
00:20:10.680 --> 00:20:12.210
The final major act of Frederick.

347
00:20:12.310 --> 00:20:15.890
The Great's life was also his most infamous since the 1760s,

348
00:20:15.891 --> 00:20:20.010
the kingdom of Poland had been beset by internal problems that made it look

349
00:20:20.011 --> 00:20:22.610
woefully weak for Poland's predatory neighbors.

350
00:20:22.680 --> 00:20:26.570
That meant one thing only dinner time. The first one to say out loud,

351
00:20:26.571 --> 00:20:30.210
what everyone had been thinking was Frederick in 1769.

352
00:20:30.570 --> 00:20:33.360
He tried to get Catherine the great to auditioned Poland with him,

353
00:20:33.840 --> 00:20:36.960
but the Russian Empress mu however she didn't mu for long,

354
00:20:36.961 --> 00:20:37.840
because down in Austria,

355
00:20:38.240 --> 00:20:42.280
Maria therea was starting to seriously think about expanding her own territory.

356
00:20:42.300 --> 00:20:45.680
So Frederick convinced them both to join him in slicing up Poland.

357
00:20:45.860 --> 00:20:49.720
The first partition of Poland was the start of a process that would soon wipe

358
00:20:49.780 --> 00:20:52.880
the kingdom from the map taking place in 1772,

359
00:20:53.000 --> 00:20:56.720
it saw Russia and Austria both take huge bites of territory.

360
00:20:57.160 --> 00:20:59.240
The part Frederick took a much smaller chunk,

361
00:20:59.340 --> 00:21:03.760
but one that was incredibly significant prior to the partition PR had been a

362
00:21:03.940 --> 00:21:06.750
wildly discontinuous state with east Russia,

363
00:21:06.860 --> 00:21:11.350
separated from Berlin by a Polish territory, known as Royal Prusa.

364
00:21:11.450 --> 00:21:14.990
It was this piece of lands that Frederick now gobbled up transforming PRSA for

365
00:21:14.991 --> 00:21:19.190
the first time into a unified state with clear defensible frontiers.

366
00:21:19.670 --> 00:21:22.030
Although he failed to gain the great port city of Danza,

367
00:21:22.031 --> 00:21:26.710
he did net control of the VI and thus the grain trade from then on

368
00:21:27.380 --> 00:21:29.140
men's in Prussia would become much rarer.

369
00:21:29.240 --> 00:21:33.060
And that was really it for F Fred's reign. Well not in a technic year old sense.

370
00:21:33.061 --> 00:21:36.020
He lived for another 14 years during which he continued to support the arts,

371
00:21:36.340 --> 00:21:37.010
build up the army,

372
00:21:37.010 --> 00:21:41.540
modernize the state and do delightful things like introduce the potato to

373
00:21:41.541 --> 00:21:44.140
Prussia. But as far as highlights go,

374
00:21:44.400 --> 00:21:49.330
the sort that might be covers in a 23 minute video of Poland was the

375
00:21:49.331 --> 00:21:52.410
last big one. Frederick the great died on August the 17th,

376
00:21:52.770 --> 00:21:54.570
1786 at the age of 74,

377
00:21:54.660 --> 00:21:58.370
while his passing didn't mark the ends of the age of enlightened despotism,

378
00:21:58.790 --> 00:22:01.050
it came pretty close. Just three short years later,

379
00:22:01.051 --> 00:22:04.250
the French revolution would launch the continent into a brand new EPO.

380
00:22:04.810 --> 00:22:07.890
One in which Frederick seems not like some grand reformist.

381
00:22:08.680 --> 00:22:10.960
But's rather a Relic of a bag on age yet.

382
00:22:10.961 --> 00:22:14.000
This dramatic shift didn't mean that Frederick was forgotten.

383
00:22:14.180 --> 00:22:15.280
As we've already mentioned,

384
00:22:15.300 --> 00:22:19.080
one of the King's biggest fans was Napoleon Bonna apart who considered Frederick

385
00:22:19.280 --> 00:22:23.240
a great general and the battle of Luther his masterpiece.

386
00:22:23.500 --> 00:22:25.360
But even after the death of Leite,

387
00:22:25.640 --> 00:22:29.470
corporal Frederick's influence remained across the next 160 years.

388
00:22:29.471 --> 00:22:32.910
Many politicians tried to claim him as one of their own in the 19th century,

389
00:22:33.020 --> 00:22:37.270
Bismark encouraged others to see him as Frederick's successor finishing the work

390
00:22:37.470 --> 00:22:41.430
had begun in world war I German high command used his memory to inspire the

391
00:22:41.431 --> 00:22:43.350
troops to keep on fighting during world war II.

392
00:22:43.670 --> 00:22:45.790
Adolf Hitler even kept a portrait of Frederick in his bunker.

393
00:22:45.790 --> 00:22:49.420
Perhaps hoping that some of the old Kings tactical genius might rub on him

394
00:22:49.630 --> 00:22:51.860
today, likely because of the Hitler connection.

395
00:22:51.861 --> 00:22:55.460
It's less fashionable to see Frederick as some kind of great German warrior.

396
00:22:55.770 --> 00:22:56.480
Undoubtedly,

397
00:22:56.480 --> 00:22:59.860
his occasional genius as a leader on the battlefield is still celebrated,

398
00:23:00.280 --> 00:23:03.740
but now we're equally likely to be drawn to his peace time work here.

399
00:23:04.100 --> 00:23:07.860
Art rule was a king who set the template for an enlightenment ruler,

400
00:23:08.020 --> 00:23:11.930
a man who took a small military state and turned it into one of the great

401
00:23:11.931 --> 00:23:13.450
centers of European culture.

402
00:23:13.800 --> 00:23:16.490
It's easy to forget just how different things could have been,

403
00:23:16.710 --> 00:23:20.250
how easily Frederick could have been like his father, a pumper soldier,

404
00:23:20.370 --> 00:23:25.010
marching rounds with his chest puffed out like some diluted pigeon that he

405
00:23:25.011 --> 00:23:28.810
wasn't speaks both to his era, but also to his character,

406
00:23:29.090 --> 00:23:32.440
a character that him admire across the whole of Europe.

407
00:23:32.780 --> 00:23:36.480
His name may have sometimes been misused by those who came after him,

408
00:23:36.740 --> 00:23:41.720
but there's no denying that Frederick II really did deserve his title. Great.

409
00:23:42.820 --> 00:23:44.840
