below more on them in just a bit

5
00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:22.510
Hottest hell March 13th, 19 esteemed mortal of new Orleans.

6
00:00:23.020 --> 00:00:25.390
They have never caught me and they never will.

7
00:00:25.580 --> 00:00:27.670
They have never seen me for I'm invisible.

8
00:00:27.820 --> 00:00:31.790
Even as the ether that surrounds your earth, I'm not a human being,

9
00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:35.110
but a spirit and a demon from the hottest hell I am.

10
00:00:35.111 --> 00:00:39.910
What you Orleans and your foolish police call the ax. Man. When I see third,

11
00:00:40.030 --> 00:00:43.980
I shall come and claim a, the victims. I alone know whom they shall be.

12
00:00:44.140 --> 00:00:45.260
I shall leave no clue,

13
00:00:45.280 --> 00:00:49.980
except my bloody acts smeared with blood and brains of he,

14
00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:53.940
whom I have sent below to keep me company undoubtedly, you IANS.

15
00:00:53.941 --> 00:00:56.820
Think of me as a most horrible murderer, which I am,

16
00:00:57.080 --> 00:00:59.020
but I could be much worse if I wanted to.

17
00:00:59.080 --> 00:01:03.210
If I wished I could pay a visit to a city every night at will,

18
00:01:03.410 --> 00:01:08.010
I could slay thousands of your best citizens and the worst for I'm in close

19
00:01:08.011 --> 00:01:11.170
relationship with the angel of death, those art words,

20
00:01:11.171 --> 00:01:13.050
purported to be from new Orleans,

21
00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:16.210
most notorious and most mysterious serial killer.

22
00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:20.130
A man who broke its people's homes at night and butchered them where they slept

23
00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:21.930
the man who made a demo,

24
00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:26.120
unlike any other killer in history to have the entire city filled with the

25
00:01:26.121 --> 00:01:30.680
swinging sounds of jazz music or risk incurring his murderous wrath.

26
00:01:30.860 --> 00:01:34.600
The man who came to be known as the Axman of new Orleans.

27
00:01:41.260 --> 00:01:44.310
The terror started on the, of may the 23rd, 1918.

28
00:01:44.370 --> 00:01:48.070
As the city of new Orleans slept an intruder broke into the house of Joseph and

29
00:01:48.350 --> 00:01:51.670
Catherine Magio on the corner of Magnolia street and upper line.

30
00:01:51.730 --> 00:01:54.750
He found an ax in the garden, went inside the bedroom and butchered,

31
00:01:54.751 --> 00:01:56.230
both husband and wife in their sleep.

32
00:01:56.231 --> 00:01:59.590
Joseph Magio was probably targeted first since he was still in bed.

33
00:01:59.660 --> 00:02:02.830
When the crime was discovered while Catherine's body lay on the floor,

34
00:02:03.300 --> 00:02:07.140
the pool of blood indicating that she never woken during the attack and tried to

35
00:02:07.141 --> 00:02:10.180
make a run for it. Although it proved to be in vain. The couple had no children,

36
00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:11.540
although Joseph's younger brother,

37
00:02:11.541 --> 00:02:14.340
Andrew Magio lived with them and he was in the next room,

38
00:02:14.341 --> 00:02:16.900
sleeping off a late drinking session when they were killed.

39
00:02:16.960 --> 00:02:20.740
It wasn't until the next morning around 5:00 AM that Andrew Magio woke up until

40
00:02:21.400 --> 00:02:23.810
MOS coming from the adjoining room. He banged on all,

41
00:02:23.870 --> 00:02:27.530
but he did not receive a reply. So he left the house and ran to another sibling.

42
00:02:27.970 --> 00:02:31.730
Jake Magio who lived a block away and told him what had happened together.

43
00:02:31.760 --> 00:02:34.330
They went to pick up the fourth Magio brother Salvador,

44
00:02:34.570 --> 00:02:36.690
and the trio return to the house about half an hour later,

45
00:02:36.910 --> 00:02:40.170
and finally entered the bedroom before the lay Gastly site one,

46
00:02:40.180 --> 00:02:42.810
which was described in the afternoon. Addition of that day,

47
00:02:42.830 --> 00:02:46.480
the new Orleans states blind Agon across the bed with his feet,

48
00:02:46.481 --> 00:02:49.280
touching the floor was the body of Joseph Magio on the floor,

49
00:02:49.390 --> 00:02:51.960
alongside the bed and resting across the feet of her.

50
00:02:51.961 --> 00:02:53.760
Husband's lay the dead body of his wife.

51
00:02:53.820 --> 00:02:57.760
<v 1>The floors and bed were smeared with blood to the man was not yet dead.</v>

52
00:02:57.830 --> 00:03:00.600
Jake Magio someone, the police while Andrew telephone,

53
00:03:00.601 --> 00:03:01.920
the charity hospital ambulance,

54
00:03:02.140 --> 00:03:04.960
he died shortly after the arrival of the interns from the hospital.

55
00:03:05.180 --> 00:03:08.000
<v 0>The authorities arrived on the scene to investigate the double homicide</v>

56
00:03:08.001 --> 00:03:10.360
footprint suggested that the killer hopped to the fence,

57
00:03:10.361 --> 00:03:14.400
which surrounded the house and then used a screw driver to pry out a panel from

58
00:03:14.401 --> 00:03:16.840
the door and crawled through it. In sight, the murder weapon,

59
00:03:16.980 --> 00:03:18.280
he used appeared to be an ax,

60
00:03:18.281 --> 00:03:21.150
which he found in the Maggio's backyard and he left it in the bedroom.

61
00:03:21.200 --> 00:03:24.590
After he was done. A first police suspected that the crime was a robbery,

62
00:03:24.591 --> 00:03:25.950
which turned to homicides,

63
00:03:25.951 --> 00:03:29.550
but there were several clues that did not point in that direction. For starters,

64
00:03:29.650 --> 00:03:32.630
the killer left the jewelry behind Joseph Magio had a safe,

65
00:03:32.631 --> 00:03:35.750
which was indeed found open, but it showed no signs of forced entry.

66
00:03:35.770 --> 00:03:40.020
The grocery had recently deposited a large sum into the bank around $650.

67
00:03:40.080 --> 00:03:43.660
So it may be that the safe was already open because it was empty. Otherwise,

68
00:03:43.680 --> 00:03:47.100
the only way the killer would've gotten it open without leaving any marks was if

69
00:03:47.101 --> 00:03:48.060
he knew the combination,

70
00:03:54.260 --> 00:03:57.790
This led the police to consider the possibility of it being an inside job with

71
00:03:57.791 --> 00:03:59.910
the younger brother being involved somehow after all,

72
00:03:59.911 --> 00:04:03.340
this was only the first attack and authorities had no way of knowing.

73
00:04:03.341 --> 00:04:07.020
It was the beginning of a crime spree and the presence of Andrew Magio did raise

74
00:04:07.060 --> 00:04:10.500
a lot of questions. How come he didn't hear any noises during the attack,

75
00:04:10.501 --> 00:04:12.140
but was later woken up by the moons,

76
00:04:12.141 --> 00:04:13.740
coming from the bedroom and speaking of the bedroom,

77
00:04:13.960 --> 00:04:15.500
why didn't he enter it immediately?

78
00:04:15.560 --> 00:04:17.460
And instead left to collect his other brothers.

79
00:04:17.461 --> 00:04:19.780
<v 1>It could have been that he panicked or that he was scared,</v>

80
00:04:19.781 --> 00:04:23.370
but it could also have been that he wanted witnesses since he knew what he was

81
00:04:23.371 --> 00:04:26.010
going to find in there. And why did the killer spare him anyway?

82
00:04:26.110 --> 00:04:30.450
Was it that he did not know that Andrew Magio was also in the house or was it

83
00:04:30.451 --> 00:04:32.290
because he himself was doing the killing?

84
00:04:32.380 --> 00:04:35.850
<v 0>These suspicions were enough to turn the younger brother into the chief suspect.</v>

85
00:04:35.910 --> 00:04:39.570
He was arrested later that day and continued investigations uncovered even more

86
00:04:39.810 --> 00:04:42.360
evidence that incriminated him in the backyard of Magio home.

87
00:04:42.361 --> 00:04:45.640
Police found the screwdriver used to gain entry to the house in the next yard.

88
00:04:45.641 --> 00:04:48.440
They found a pair of blood soaked socks and a bloody razor.

89
00:04:48.441 --> 00:04:50.920
Despite the ax man's Monica. In this particular case,

90
00:04:50.921 --> 00:04:54.200
the razor turned out to be the main murder weapon as the killer used it to cut

91
00:04:54.201 --> 00:04:58.840
the throats of Joseph and Catherine Magio only afterwards did he used the ax on

92
00:04:58.841 --> 00:04:59.001
them,

93
00:04:59.001 --> 00:05:02.950
maybe as the police suspected at the time in an attempt hide the initial wounds,

94
00:05:02.970 --> 00:05:06.830
the reason they found this suspicious was because Andrew Magio was a barber and

95
00:05:06.970 --> 00:05:09.350
the razor was just like the ones he used at work.

96
00:05:09.530 --> 00:05:12.470
The authorities thought this was going to be a straightforward case.

97
00:05:12.471 --> 00:05:16.470
Andrew Magio was in custody and they fully expected to bring charges against

98
00:05:16.471 --> 00:05:18.510
him. However, the case soon started falling apart.

99
00:05:18.610 --> 00:05:20.750
The razor turns out not to belong to the barber.

100
00:05:21.070 --> 00:05:24.740
And even though his story was at fishy, there was no evidence to contradict it.

101
00:05:24.840 --> 00:05:27.860
He was released a few days after the killing and eventually the police focused

102
00:05:27.861 --> 00:05:31.100
their efforts in another direction with the police superintendent saying that

103
00:05:31.101 --> 00:05:35.460
the case had taken a peculiar turn and will become more interesting from the

104
00:05:35.461 --> 00:05:36.820
standpoint of the investigators.

105
00:05:43.150 --> 00:05:46.050
The next attack occurred on June the 27th, 1918,

106
00:05:46.051 --> 00:05:50.970
when the Axman targeted Louis Baumer and Harriet Lowe sometimes identified as

107
00:05:51.250 --> 00:05:54.370
Anna low while they were sleeping in the back of his grocery shop at the corner

108
00:05:54.470 --> 00:05:55.330
of do OI.

109
00:05:55.650 --> 00:06:00.240
And Laha like Joseph Magio Baumer was an Italian shopkeeper showing that the

110
00:06:00.241 --> 00:06:02.520
killer may have had a tight when it came to choosing his victims.

111
00:06:02.820 --> 00:06:06.440
The couple was discovered in the early hours of the morning by John Zanker,

112
00:06:06.520 --> 00:06:08.960
a bakery van driver who was making his routine delivery.

113
00:06:09.360 --> 00:06:10.880
When nobody met him to open the sharp,

114
00:06:10.900 --> 00:06:14.240
he went into the bedroom in the back and found Baumer and Lowe sitting in

115
00:06:14.241 --> 00:06:15.074
puddles of blood,

116
00:06:15.220 --> 00:06:19.470
but still alive that gushing head injuries that had been made by an ax,

117
00:06:19.471 --> 00:06:22.670
which had been left in the bathroom. No razor was used this time.

118
00:06:23.230 --> 00:06:25.590
Zanker alerted the police and both victims were taken to the hospital.

119
00:06:25.950 --> 00:06:27.710
They would both later again, consciousness.

120
00:06:27.760 --> 00:06:31.110
There were a lot of similarities between this attack and the Magio murders.

121
00:06:31.170 --> 00:06:34.350
In both cases, the intruder ambushed, a sleeping couple in their bedroom.

122
00:06:34.650 --> 00:06:38.020
He used an ax that he found inside the house. Since he gained entry,

123
00:06:38.080 --> 00:06:39.580
by knocking out a panel in the door,

124
00:06:39.860 --> 00:06:42.500
the police were still reluctant to call both attacks the work of the same

125
00:06:42.600 --> 00:06:43.040
madman.

126
00:06:43.040 --> 00:06:47.820
So instead they investigated it as an individual robbery and looked for suspects

127
00:06:47.821 --> 00:06:51.700
with a connection to Baumer. Initially John Z anchor was treated as a suspect,

128
00:06:51.800 --> 00:06:53.500
but other than the fact that he found the bodies,

129
00:06:53.860 --> 00:06:55.620
that was nothing to suggest that he was the culprit.

130
00:06:55.650 --> 00:06:59.090
Then police shifted their attention to Aman names. Louis Uber con,

131
00:06:59.110 --> 00:07:02.010
who had recently started working in Baum store like anchor.

132
00:07:02.270 --> 00:07:06.570
He was more a suspect of convenience rather than somebody with actual evidence

133
00:07:06.571 --> 00:07:09.890
against him. His alibi was a little weak, but that was about it.

134
00:07:10.030 --> 00:07:13.170
But Harriet Lowe insisted that her attacker was not black. So again,

135
00:07:13.171 --> 00:07:14.890
the police began looking for somebody else.

136
00:07:15.030 --> 00:07:17.930
And that was when the case took a rather strange turn.

137
00:07:18.230 --> 00:07:20.920
Harriet Lowe had made a series of unusual statements.

138
00:07:21.020 --> 00:07:24.400
The attack on her had been much more vicious than a Baumer.

139
00:07:24.401 --> 00:07:27.880
She had suffered brain damage and went in and out of delirium. And in fact,

140
00:07:27.881 --> 00:07:31.080
she died seven weeks later from her injuries. In the meantime,

141
00:07:31.081 --> 00:07:33.320
she was reluctant to cooperate with the police or the press,

142
00:07:33.321 --> 00:07:35.880
mainly because she feared the scandal that became front page news.

143
00:07:35.881 --> 00:07:38.080
When it was discovered that she was not married to the gross,

144
00:07:38.440 --> 00:07:41.270
but she was as mistres, but even more bizarrely,

145
00:07:41.271 --> 00:07:44.670
she became increasingly convinced that it was Baumer himself who attacked her.

146
00:07:44.671 --> 00:07:48.030
The police warmed up to this idea. They found letters in Baum's home,

147
00:07:48.190 --> 00:07:50.790
in different languages in Yiddish and German and Russian.

148
00:07:50.930 --> 00:07:54.710
So they flirted with the idea. The whole gross routine was an act.

149
00:07:54.711 --> 00:07:57.950
And he was in fact, German spy, part of a secret espionage ring.

150
00:07:57.970 --> 00:08:01.020
And that he Harriet Lowe when she discovered his true identity.

151
00:08:01.280 --> 00:08:03.460
She agreed with this conclusion, but again,

152
00:08:03.570 --> 00:08:06.940
Harriet Lowe was delirious and lingering on the brink of death.

153
00:08:07.050 --> 00:08:08.260
When she finally did die,

154
00:08:08.261 --> 00:08:12.180
police arrested Lewis Baumer on a murder charge and he was imprisoned for nine

155
00:08:12.181 --> 00:08:15.900
months awaiting trial before a sensible jury acquitted him after 10 minutes of

156
00:08:15.901 --> 00:08:19.930
deliberation in May, 1919. Now we return to our murder mystery in a moment.

157
00:08:19.990 --> 00:08:23.330

179
00:09:33.800 --> 00:09:37.380
There had been two attack so far resulting in three deaths. And in each case,

180
00:09:37.400 --> 00:09:39.820
the police tried to charge someone tied to the victims.

181
00:09:40.050 --> 00:09:43.020
They had not connected the two assaults yet, at least not publicly.

182
00:09:43.021 --> 00:09:46.780
It was after the third that they admitted that new Orleans might have an ax

183
00:09:46.781 --> 00:09:49.300
wielding Madden on the loose. It happens on August the fifth,

184
00:09:49.580 --> 00:09:52.460
1918 when 28 year old Anna Schneider was attacked in her bedroom.

185
00:09:52.490 --> 00:09:53.323
Late in the evening,

186
00:09:53.440 --> 00:09:57.090
the woman was eight months pregnant and woke during the night to see a shadowy

187
00:09:57.091 --> 00:10:00.090
figure looming over her. He began hitting her in the head with an object.

188
00:10:00.160 --> 00:10:03.370
Some sources reported that it was an ax while others said that it was a lamp

189
00:10:03.371 --> 00:10:04.890
from a bedside table. Her husband,

190
00:10:05.370 --> 00:10:08.690
ed Schneider arrived home from work after midnight found his wife and took her

191
00:10:08.691 --> 00:10:09.524
to the hospital.

192
00:10:09.530 --> 00:10:11.890
Pascal scar had been cut open and she was missing multiple teeth.

193
00:10:11.910 --> 00:10:14.050
But Mrs. Schneider had not only survived the attack,

194
00:10:14.051 --> 00:10:17.480
but went on to deliver a baby a few days in later, unfortunately for the police,

195
00:10:17.540 --> 00:10:20.240
she did not become their key witness. They were hoping for.

196
00:10:20.520 --> 00:10:23.720
And a Schneider couldn't remember anything about her attacker and was unable to

197
00:10:23.721 --> 00:10:25.080
provide a description. Clearly,

198
00:10:25.140 --> 00:10:28.840
the Axman was unhappy with the results of this latest hit because this time he

199
00:10:28.841 --> 00:10:31.720
only waited five days before striking again on August the 10th,

200
00:10:31.920 --> 00:10:33.400
the killer attacked Joseph Ram Romano,

201
00:10:33.520 --> 00:10:36.280
an elderly man who lived with his two nieces on that morning.

202
00:10:36.570 --> 00:10:39.710
Two young women woken up by the commotion and entered their uncle's room.

203
00:10:39.711 --> 00:10:42.230
To see that the man had received a heavy ax blow to the head.

204
00:10:42.290 --> 00:10:44.310
He remains conscious until the ambulance arrived,

205
00:10:44.410 --> 00:10:46.630
but Joseph Romano died a couple of days later.

206
00:10:46.860 --> 00:10:51.030
This attack shed a lot more similarities to the first two than the one at the

207
00:10:51.110 --> 00:10:54.950
Schneider house. For starters, the intru to target an Italian proprietor. Again,

208
00:10:54.951 --> 00:10:56.990
Joseph Ram Romano had a barbershop in the neighborhood.

209
00:10:57.120 --> 00:10:58.940
He definitely used an ax this time,

210
00:10:58.941 --> 00:11:03.260
which he dumped in a backyard and he gained entry to the house by knocking out a

211
00:11:03.261 --> 00:11:05.620
panel. Now there was no way to avoid a panic anymore.

212
00:11:05.840 --> 00:11:09.300
New Orleans knew that it had a killer in its MIS and the city fell into chaos.

213
00:11:09.600 --> 00:11:12.060
As police began receiving countless reports of people,

214
00:11:12.061 --> 00:11:15.260
seeing ax men in their neighborhoods and parents started staying away,

215
00:11:15.460 --> 00:11:18.930
can turn to guard their families while they slept a few people even reported

216
00:11:18.931 --> 00:11:21.410
finding discarded AEs in their backyards in the morning,

217
00:11:21.411 --> 00:11:25.330
either as the result of pranks or as a sign that they almost received a visit

218
00:11:25.331 --> 00:11:26.164
from the ax man,

219
00:11:26.350 --> 00:11:30.370
all the fear and detention seemed to satiate the madman because he waited for

220
00:11:30.371 --> 00:11:31.850
eight months before killing again

221
00:11:38.080 --> 00:11:39.960
For his next attack. The Aman decided to,

222
00:11:40.040 --> 00:11:42.880
to venture off the beaten path and instead of striking in new Orleans, again,

223
00:11:42.881 --> 00:11:46.400
he crossed the Mississippi river into gret Louisiana and committed his most

224
00:11:46.470 --> 00:11:50.000
heinous assault. He targeted an entire family of Italian immigrants,

225
00:11:50.240 --> 00:11:53.360
the father Charles Cordelia, who worked as a grower,

226
00:11:53.361 --> 00:11:55.880
the mother Rosies their two year old daughter, Mary.

227
00:11:56.060 --> 00:11:58.680
It happens on the night of March the 10th, 1919.

228
00:11:58.780 --> 00:12:00.200
The scene was the same as the rest.

229
00:12:00.560 --> 00:12:04.160
A panel had been chiseled outta the back door and a bloody AXS was found left in

230
00:12:04.161 --> 00:12:07.200
the yard. The KME family was discovered by their neighbors,

231
00:12:07.201 --> 00:12:09.560
the Jordans who responded to their screams,

232
00:12:09.710 --> 00:12:13.830
both Charles and Rosie had sustained bloody head wound and skull fractures,

233
00:12:13.850 --> 00:12:17.390
but they were taken to the hospital and survived the attack. Unfortunately,

234
00:12:17.490 --> 00:12:19.750
the young Mary died from a blow to the back of her head,

235
00:12:19.860 --> 00:12:22.150
despite the clear similarities in the crimes. Police,

236
00:12:22.151 --> 00:12:25.390
once again were looking to arrest someone with ties to the court,

237
00:12:25.750 --> 00:12:27.350
Melia family instead of a serial killer.

238
00:12:27.450 --> 00:12:31.590
And they found an even more unexpected suspect than Lewis Sumer.

239
00:12:31.650 --> 00:12:34.500
The alleged Germans by I two suspects. In fact,

240
00:12:34.820 --> 00:12:39.260
yo Orlando and Frank Jordano the father and the son who responded to the

241
00:12:39.261 --> 00:12:43.260
family's call for help for reasons known only to her Rosie cor Melia claims that

242
00:12:44.060 --> 00:12:46.220
Joos were the ones who attacked them and killed her daughter.

243
00:12:46.230 --> 00:12:47.260
There was a mild motive.

244
00:12:47.440 --> 00:12:51.660
The GIS were also grosses in direct competition with Charles caught Melia Rin

245
00:12:52.100 --> 00:12:53.260
that coral in the past, however,

246
00:12:53.261 --> 00:12:57.370
was almost entirely on Rosie's testimony that the father and some were arrested

247
00:12:57.430 --> 00:12:58.410
and quickly convicted.

248
00:12:58.890 --> 00:13:01.970
Iland Drano was sentenced to life in prison while his son was given the death

249
00:13:01.971 --> 00:13:05.810
penalty, GRE police made no attempt to connect their case to the Axman murders.

250
00:13:05.811 --> 00:13:08.850
Insisting that that was something which was happening in new Orleans's and did

251
00:13:08.851 --> 00:13:09.610
not concern them.

252
00:13:09.610 --> 00:13:12.970
There were several reasons why Theranos were not the attackers apart from a

253
00:13:13.090 --> 00:13:17.360
complete lack of the starters, Yano JDAO was almost 70 years old.

254
00:13:17.420 --> 00:13:19.360
He was too weak and frail to commit the crimes.

255
00:13:19.570 --> 00:13:21.600
Frank JDAO would've been strong enough to do it,

256
00:13:21.601 --> 00:13:23.400
but at six feet and over 200 pounds,

257
00:13:23.420 --> 00:13:26.000
he was too big to fit through the door panel that had been removed.

258
00:13:26.020 --> 00:13:29.320
But the most obvious sign of their innocence was the fact that Charles Corlia

259
00:13:29.340 --> 00:13:30.680
did not back up his wife's story.

260
00:13:31.040 --> 00:13:33.360
But first he said that he had no recollection of the attack,

261
00:13:33.361 --> 00:13:35.950
but later became convinced that his wife was lying.

262
00:13:35.960 --> 00:13:38.470
Eventually Rosie KLIA did admit the lie.

263
00:13:38.490 --> 00:13:40.350
The father and son were acquitted of the crimes.

264
00:13:40.450 --> 00:13:44.390
But the true story behind this bizarre event is still unclear as there are too

265
00:13:44.391 --> 00:13:45.350
many versions out there.

266
00:13:45.420 --> 00:13:49.670
Some say that Rosie KLIA tried to frame the Drano is out of jealousy. In spite,

267
00:13:49.890 --> 00:13:52.510
her doctor believed it was because of the trauma and brain damage.

268
00:13:52.570 --> 00:13:53.670
She had suffered in the attack.

269
00:13:53.671 --> 00:13:57.660
Rosie herself said that she had been coerced into doing it by Graner police.

270
00:13:57.800 --> 00:14:01.700
And that later the district attorney threatened her with perjury charge and

271
00:14:01.701 --> 00:14:05.180
prison time. If she recanted, eventually she decided to come clean anyway.

272
00:14:05.181 --> 00:14:08.340
After St. Joseph appeared to her in her dream and encouraged her to confess,

273
00:14:14.570 --> 00:14:17.250
Despite all the evidence of the quarter Melia case,

274
00:14:17.430 --> 00:14:21.370
the most surprising aspect of the whole crime spree occurred a few days after

275
00:14:21.430 --> 00:14:21.971
the attack.

276
00:14:21.971 --> 00:14:25.770
When the New York times PCA U received a letter purported to be from the ax man

277
00:14:25.771 --> 00:14:27.570
himself, we've already mentioned part of it.

278
00:14:27.590 --> 00:14:30.530
It contains the kind of stuff you would expect from a deranged killer.

279
00:14:30.670 --> 00:14:32.730
He talked about how big and scary you was,

280
00:14:32.750 --> 00:14:35.970
how incompetent the police were and how the entire city was a mercy.

281
00:14:36.180 --> 00:14:38.760
But the ending of the letter came with a very strange demand.

282
00:14:39.110 --> 00:14:42.680
Here is what it said now to be exact at 12, 15 earthly time.

283
00:14:42.681 --> 00:14:46.960
On next Tuesday night, I'm going to pass over new Orleans in my infinite mercy.

284
00:14:47.240 --> 00:14:50.280
I am going to make a little proposition to you people here it is.

285
00:14:50.700 --> 00:14:52.000
I'm very fond of jazz music.

286
00:14:52.100 --> 00:14:55.960
And I swear by all the devils in the nether regions that every person should be

287
00:14:56.020 --> 00:14:58.880
spared in, whose home a jazz band is in full swing.

288
00:14:58.900 --> 00:15:02.960
At the time that I have just mentioned, if everyone has a jazz band going well,

289
00:15:03.070 --> 00:15:06.200
then so much the better for you people. One thing is certain,

290
00:15:06.500 --> 00:15:07.720
and that is some of you,

291
00:15:07.721 --> 00:15:11.230
people who do not jazz it out on that specific tee Tuesday night,

292
00:15:11.570 --> 00:15:14.030
if there be any, we'll get the ax well,

293
00:15:14.050 --> 00:15:18.350
as I'm cold and crave the warmth of my native guitarists. And it is about time.

294
00:15:18.510 --> 00:15:21.030
I leave your earthly home. I will cease my discourse,

295
00:15:21.130 --> 00:15:25.350
hoping that thou will publish this, that it may go well with the,

296
00:15:25.670 --> 00:15:30.230
I have been am and will be the worst spirit that ever existed either. In fact,

297
00:15:30.290 --> 00:15:34.580
or realm of fan to see the ax man, his instructions were pretty clear.

298
00:15:34.640 --> 00:15:37.700
The letter was published on March the 13th and the date of the big party

299
00:15:37.780 --> 00:15:39.340
would've been March the 19th.

300
00:15:39.450 --> 00:15:43.380
What really happened on that night is somewhat murky today after many repeated

301
00:15:43.381 --> 00:15:45.180
and exaggerated retellings. However,

302
00:15:45.400 --> 00:15:49.620
the story goes that the entire city of new Orleans jazzed it out per the ax

303
00:15:49.621 --> 00:15:52.650
man's demands, dance halls and jazz abs were filled to capacity.

304
00:15:53.070 --> 00:15:55.850
Pianos and record players could be heard playing in people's homes.

305
00:15:55.950 --> 00:15:58.570
One local musician named Joseph, John Dilla,

306
00:15:58.800 --> 00:16:01.170
even composed a piece to commemorate the event,

307
00:16:01.171 --> 00:16:05.050
which he titled the mysterious ax. Man's jazz don't scare me, Papa.

308
00:16:05.190 --> 00:16:06.410
Nobody was killed that night.

309
00:16:06.440 --> 00:16:09.290
Some say that the ax man walked the streets of new Orleans all night,

310
00:16:09.291 --> 00:16:13.280
delighted to see that he got an entire city to do his others are skeptical that

311
00:16:13.281 --> 00:16:14.560
the letter even came from the killer.

312
00:16:14.650 --> 00:16:18.360
After all it didn't contain any details or identifies that only the ax man would

313
00:16:18.361 --> 00:16:19.440
know if it was a hoax.

314
00:16:19.441 --> 00:16:22.880
Then it ended up making the killer far more notorious than the murders

315
00:16:22.881 --> 00:16:23.714
themselves.

316
00:16:29.620 --> 00:16:31.440
At least three more attacks occurred that year,

317
00:16:31.441 --> 00:16:34.590
which are usually attributed the Agman a fourth one might have been averted.

318
00:16:34.591 --> 00:16:38.070
When a man named William Carson scared away and intruder by firing a few shots

319
00:16:38.090 --> 00:16:41.510
in his direction. The three targets were Steve Boer, Sarah lawman,

320
00:16:41.570 --> 00:16:44.270
and Mike Pepitone Boker and lawman were both attacked,

321
00:16:44.271 --> 00:16:45.470
but managed to make enough noise,

322
00:16:45.490 --> 00:16:48.030
to alert the neighbors and prompt their assailant, a flee.

323
00:16:48.031 --> 00:16:49.550
They both recovered from their injuries.

324
00:16:49.830 --> 00:16:53.260
Although neither one could provide any useful clues as to the identity of a

325
00:16:53.261 --> 00:16:56.100
attacker. Mike pone story is a bit more uncertain.

326
00:16:56.320 --> 00:16:59.780
His wife found him at around 1:00 AM. He was still alive. Although unconscious,

327
00:16:59.781 --> 00:17:02.900
after being struck in the head, numerous times, the murder weapon was unclear.

328
00:17:02.960 --> 00:17:06.460
It wasn't an ax maybe because the attacker cannot find one and it could have

329
00:17:06.461 --> 00:17:08.740
been an iron bar of some kind or a large bolt.

330
00:17:09.010 --> 00:17:12.740
Mike Pepitone died in the hospital after a few hours and many consider him to be

331
00:17:12.741 --> 00:17:14.730
the ax man, SI X and final victim.

332
00:17:15.090 --> 00:17:18.850
Although others have asserted that his attack may have been mob related and not

333
00:17:18.851 --> 00:17:21.610
committed by the serial killer either way. After 1919,

334
00:17:21.611 --> 00:17:24.530
the ax man of new Orleans disappeared and was never heard from again,

335
00:17:24.630 --> 00:17:26.690
the same three possibilities were put forward.

336
00:17:26.790 --> 00:17:29.810
As in any crime spree that stopped suddenly the killer died.

337
00:17:29.950 --> 00:17:33.130
He moved away or he was imprisoned for unrelated offenses.

338
00:17:33.310 --> 00:17:35.240
His identity has never been established.

339
00:17:35.340 --> 00:17:38.080
The police certainly tried to charge plenty of people for the crimes.

340
00:17:38.560 --> 00:17:42.600
Andrew Mao Lewis, Baumer, Lewison, Orlando, and Frank Drano.

341
00:17:42.940 --> 00:17:46.480
But these were more about wanting to clear the murders at any cast,

342
00:17:46.660 --> 00:17:50.600
by finding someone who fit the bill rather than actually following the evidence.

343
00:17:50.820 --> 00:17:53.640
But there is one more notable name to mention one,

344
00:17:53.641 --> 00:17:58.400
which has become a popular suspect among crime busts, Joseph mum or mum.

345
00:17:58.780 --> 00:18:01.560
He wasn't on the police's radar, but in December, 1921,

346
00:18:01.561 --> 00:18:05.160
he was gunned down on the streets of Los Angeles. His killer was ster Paone.

347
00:18:05.260 --> 00:18:08.160
The widow of Mike Pepitone purported to be the ax man's final.

348
00:18:08.660 --> 00:18:10.230
When being interrogated by the police,

349
00:18:10.290 --> 00:18:13.110
she claims that he was the man responsible for her husband's death.

350
00:18:13.220 --> 00:18:13.991
Ever since then,

351
00:18:13.991 --> 00:18:17.870
Joseph mum has been put forward as a likely candidate for being the AXS man.

352
00:18:18.150 --> 00:18:21.630
But the criminal records and historical documents, don't back up this claim,

353
00:18:21.631 --> 00:18:24.190
according to surviving newspaper articles. From that time,

354
00:18:24.550 --> 00:18:26.910
Esther did shoot this man who went by several names,

355
00:18:27.090 --> 00:18:30.460
but it was because she thought he was to the disappearance of her second

356
00:18:30.461 --> 00:18:33.540
husband. And not her first after Mike pepperoni's murder,

357
00:18:33.640 --> 00:18:37.220
she moved away and married a man named Angelo, a Baro who went missing,

358
00:18:37.580 --> 00:18:40.380
but due to numerous retellings and inaccurate reporting from the media,

359
00:18:40.560 --> 00:18:43.940
the story changed that she was avenging the death of Mike pone.

360
00:18:43.960 --> 00:18:47.100
And consequently mum became suspected to being the Axman.

361
00:18:47.120 --> 00:18:50.890
It appears that he has simply another entry in a pretty long line of dubious

362
00:18:50.891 --> 00:18:52.770
suspects with confusing stories,

363
00:18:52.910 --> 00:18:56.850
but that in and of itself has a unique layer to this killing spreet makes the

364
00:18:57.170 --> 00:19:00.130
Axman of new Orleans stand out as one of the most mysterious and distinctive

365
00:19:00.131 --> 00:19:03.450
killers in the animals of crime. So I really hope you found the video.
