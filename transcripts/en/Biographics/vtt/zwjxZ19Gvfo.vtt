00:00:00.050 --> 00:00:01.880
<v 0>Today, an incredible story of espionage,</v>

2
00:00:02.200 --> 00:00:05.760
but first an incredible sponsor message from skills share.

3
00:00:05.780 --> 00:00:09.360
But my first question you has to be, do you have skills yet? I mean,

4
00:00:09.440 --> 00:00:11.880
I really have talked about a great deal on this channel.

5
00:00:11.881 --> 00:00:14.320
I've done many different spots like this for skills,

6
00:00:14.780 --> 00:00:18.960
and that means that you guys like it because otherwise they were stop paying me,

7
00:00:19.130 --> 00:00:21.230
which means that you go, I stick with it.

8
00:00:21.231 --> 00:00:25.350
<v 1>So it's probably really good. And I can personally confirm it is really good.</v>

9
00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:27.830
All right. So look, maybe you haven't got skills share yet,

10
00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:30.310
and you are a totally skill this individual,

11
00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:34.630
and that's great because there are 29,000 courses on Skillshare for you to level

12
00:00:34.631 --> 00:00:38.670
up your design business, video, social media, or well, whatever skills.

13
00:00:38.671 --> 00:00:42.540
There are a huge range. There's 29,000 of them. Me personally,

14
00:00:42.770 --> 00:00:45.340
I've taken video production courses like I've talked about before.

15
00:00:45.370 --> 00:00:48.940
<v 0>I've also taken a class on how to go viral, which I was super skeptical about,</v>

16
00:00:48.941 --> 00:00:51.180
but it turns out it's totally legit. Uh,

17
00:00:51.200 --> 00:00:56.020
lately I've been on a bit of a productivity binge as I wanna squeeze as much

18
00:00:56.080 --> 00:00:59.780
as possible out of every day. That's just how I roll.

19
00:00:59.790 --> 00:01:02.530
There is a great course on there from a go, I call Thomas Frank.

20
00:01:02.540 --> 00:01:06.650
Who's also a YouTube by the way, are getting more stuff done in a day.

21
00:01:06.760 --> 00:01:10.770
It's great stuff. It's worth checking out. If you wanna get more done in a day,

22
00:01:10.840 --> 00:01:13.530
it's kind of right there. That's productivity. That's what it's about.

23
00:01:13.790 --> 00:01:16.890
<v 1>But yes, skill share, you know, just go do it. It's also,</v>

00:01:34.550 --> 00:01:38.080
It's a good thing to do link below two months for free for the first 500 people.

31
00:01:38.420 --> 00:01:40.400
And let's get into our spice story.

32
00:01:47.010 --> 00:01:49.550
<v 0>If you have read the art of war by sun Sue,</v>

33
00:01:49.690 --> 00:01:52.670
or even if you only watched our video about sun Sue,

34
00:01:52.730 --> 00:01:55.150
you will know that above anything else.

35
00:01:55.730 --> 00:01:58.510
All war is based on deception.

36
00:01:58.970 --> 00:02:03.740
The story that we bring you today shows exactly that this is the story

37
00:02:03.800 --> 00:02:06.340
of three individuals who threw imagination,

38
00:02:06.341 --> 00:02:11.260
cunning and sheer cheek were able to fool the secret services of half of Europe

39
00:02:11.560 --> 00:02:13.420
at the height of world war II.

40
00:02:13.570 --> 00:02:17.900
This is the story of the secret agent's code named Garbo and his

41
00:02:18.030 --> 00:02:22.660
associates and how they brought about the greatest deception of the war.

42
00:02:22.970 --> 00:02:27.930
<v 1>This is ay story. So be prepared for lies for double crossing,</v>

43
00:02:27.931 --> 00:02:32.690
mysterious deaths, plot twists, and unreliable narrators. Now,

44
00:02:32.691 --> 00:02:34.450
before I start, I do have two requests.

45
00:02:34.470 --> 00:02:38.770
For those of you who already know the story of agent Garbo one,

46
00:02:38.870 --> 00:02:41.250
please don't post any spoilers in the comments.

47
00:02:41.450 --> 00:02:43.930
<v 0>I know that you guys are like me, your watch of video.</v>

48
00:02:44.220 --> 00:02:47.120
The first thing you do is scroll down and see what the comments at the top is.

49
00:02:47.220 --> 00:02:50.960
Please don't vote up the spoilers. It really does ruin the story. Number two,

50
00:02:51.200 --> 00:02:55.000
I trust you guys. Number two, even if you know the story by heart,

51
00:02:55.001 --> 00:02:58.080
please do give us a chance. Before you turn this video off,

52
00:02:58.130 --> 00:03:01.720
we've probably found a couple of things that you didn't know about one of the

53
00:03:01.721 --> 00:03:06.040
characters and why she deserves to be front and center. And look,

54
00:03:06.080 --> 00:03:07.160
I promise we're getting on with the video,

55
00:03:07.180 --> 00:03:09.640
but I do need to get another general warning. One.

56
00:03:09.641 --> 00:03:12.120
There are plenty of Spanish names in this story.

57
00:03:12.300 --> 00:03:15.920
I'm gonna do my absolute best to nail them. It's gonna be tricky.

58
00:03:16.780 --> 00:03:18.280
I'm gonna do it though. Let's do it.

59
00:03:24.410 --> 00:03:26.350
Let me introduce the first character of this story.

60
00:03:26.430 --> 00:03:31.350
A little girl called Athelia go Kaba. She was born on the 6th of July,

61
00:03:31.590 --> 00:03:35.030
1914 in Lugo Galia in Northwestern, Spain,

62
00:03:35.290 --> 00:03:38.670
her childhood in upbringing were fairly happy and largely uneventful as she was

63
00:03:38.671 --> 00:03:41.100
born into a well to do family. As she grew up,

64
00:03:41.580 --> 00:03:45.180
athe started to attract the attention of boys around her because of her

65
00:03:45.270 --> 00:03:47.020
astounding and fierce beauty,

66
00:03:47.030 --> 00:03:51.300
which made her look a bit like a movie star athe Lee's life alongside the lives

67
00:03:51.301 --> 00:03:55.460
of 25 million Spaniards changed forever on the 17th of July,

68
00:03:55.780 --> 00:03:57.740
1936, when the civil war broke out.

69
00:03:58.260 --> 00:04:00.730
Now I realized this is probably the first time we've ever talked about the

70
00:04:00.731 --> 00:04:02.650
Spanish civil war on biographics.

71
00:04:02.651 --> 00:04:06.330
So I'm just gonna go through it really quickly just to jog your memory about it.

72
00:04:06.510 --> 00:04:10.290
The war pitted the legitimate Republican government in Madrid against a

73
00:04:10.450 --> 00:04:13.890
nationalist insurgency headed by general Francisco Franco,

74
00:04:13.891 --> 00:04:17.330
both sides were supported by foreign volunteers and governments.

75
00:04:17.390 --> 00:04:21.320
The USSR provided aged to the communist. It is on the Republican side.

76
00:04:21.470 --> 00:04:25.240
This Stalinist fact was often at ons with the less extreme elements within the

77
00:04:25.241 --> 00:04:26.520
so-called popular fronts,

78
00:04:26.521 --> 00:04:31.080
which led to infighting most notably in Barcelona and the Catalonia region.

79
00:04:31.380 --> 00:04:32.130
<v 1>On the other hand,</v>

80
00:04:32.130 --> 00:04:36.280
Italy and Germany were ideologically akin to Franco and the insurgents.

81
00:04:36.281 --> 00:04:40.750
So they sent units from their armed forces to fight on their site in or

82
00:04:40.910 --> 00:04:43.830
1939 Franco and his nationalist insurgents.

83
00:04:43.831 --> 00:04:46.270
They claimed victory over the Republic.

84
00:04:46.490 --> 00:04:50.510
The region of Galia had been quickly taken over by the nationalists at the very

85
00:04:50.511 --> 00:04:51.390
beginning of the war,

86
00:04:51.391 --> 00:04:54.950
meaning Lugo would be spared the horrors of being on the front line,

87
00:04:55.170 --> 00:04:57.990
but there was still much to do on the home front.

88
00:04:58.330 --> 00:05:01.900
So the surprise of those who knew this portioned rather spoiled girl,

89
00:05:02.210 --> 00:05:05.780
athe enthusiastically volunteered in a military hospital in our hometown

90
00:05:05.860 --> 00:05:08.020
emptying bed pans, peeling potatoes,

91
00:05:08.040 --> 00:05:12.500
and above all experiencing firsthand the misery of a modern war.

92
00:05:12.720 --> 00:05:17.060
She grew more mature after the experience and so decided to move away from home.

93
00:05:17.360 --> 00:05:18.820
At the end of 1938,

94
00:05:19.120 --> 00:05:23.090
her father found her a job as a secretary to the governor of bank of Spain in B

95
00:05:23.090 --> 00:05:25.330
ergos, the acting capital for the nationalists.

96
00:05:25.590 --> 00:05:28.810
It was here in February of 1939 that she met a young officer.

97
00:05:29.030 --> 00:05:31.970
It was love at first sight. His name was Juan P.

98
00:05:38.470 --> 00:05:42.960
<v 0>Our second protagonist was born in 1912 in Barcelona into a progressive and</v>

99
00:05:42.961 --> 00:05:47.240
liberal family, Juan and his brothers grub influenced by their father's ideals.

100
00:05:47.241 --> 00:05:52.200
Freedom tolerance love for your neighbor and rejection of violence with such an

101
00:05:52.201 --> 00:05:55.680
upbringing. You would imagine that at the outbreak of the civil war,

102
00:05:55.700 --> 00:05:59.240
the 24 year old Juan would join sides with the Republicans,

103
00:05:59.380 --> 00:06:01.840
but reality is not so clear. Cut.

104
00:06:02.230 --> 00:06:06.400
Juan did initially serve with popular fronts in Catalonia during the first

105
00:06:06.680 --> 00:06:07.500
months of the war,

106
00:06:07.500 --> 00:06:12.040
but he experienced firsthand the violent internal clashes between Republicans,

107
00:06:12.210 --> 00:06:13.680
Stalinists and anarchists,

108
00:06:14.080 --> 00:06:16.910
as well as the terror like tactics used in the struggled.

109
00:06:16.911 --> 00:06:20.550
This caused him to dessert from the Republican army. And after a brief stint,

110
00:06:20.670 --> 00:06:23.990
as a chicken farm into the French border, he joins the Francoist side.

111
00:06:24.090 --> 00:06:28.030
He served with the nationalists until the end of the war as an officer in the

112
00:06:28.031 --> 00:06:30.630
signal Corps. And as a nationalist officer, he met,

113
00:06:30.740 --> 00:06:33.550
fell in love with and married the beautiful athe.

114
00:06:39.920 --> 00:06:42.940
The civil war ended with Franco's victory. And five months later,

115
00:06:42.970 --> 00:06:45.580
Germany invaded Poland for several months,

116
00:06:45.581 --> 00:06:48.140
Germany and Italy tried to enlist Spain's help.

117
00:06:48.380 --> 00:06:49.540
And that fight against the allies,

118
00:06:49.541 --> 00:06:52.300
but Franco was no fool and kept out of the war,

119
00:06:52.301 --> 00:06:56.540
allowing only a contingent of volunteers to join operation Barbara Rosa in June

120
00:06:56.541 --> 00:07:00.130
of 1940, but let's not jump too far ahead just yet.

121
00:07:00.270 --> 00:07:02.970
<v 1>I'm going to rewind back to January of 1941.</v>

122
00:07:02.971 --> 00:07:06.570
When a beautiful young lady walked into a German embassy and managed to arrange

123
00:07:06.610 --> 00:07:10.810
a meeting between a delegate and to husband, a veteran of Franco's army.

124
00:07:11.070 --> 00:07:14.090
I'm talking of course about Athelia and Juan,

125
00:07:14.350 --> 00:07:19.240
the German diplomats name was Gustav Lyner and he was the chief of the adva for

126
00:07:19.241 --> 00:07:20.320
the Iberian peninsula.

127
00:07:20.660 --> 00:07:24.160
The other was the intelligence service agency of the vere marked headed by

128
00:07:24.190 --> 00:07:29.160
Admiral VI hem canis. Juan had a bold proposal for Lena.

129
00:07:29.480 --> 00:07:34.480
<v 0>He and aha would move to Lisbon then to London and off spy for the Germans.</v>

130
00:07:34.550 --> 00:07:36.240
What was the game of the Pols? Well,

131
00:07:36.270 --> 00:07:40.110
it's possible to speculate that they did not agree with Spain's neutrality and

132
00:07:40.111 --> 00:07:44.310
wanted to do their part in the war, but Lisner did not care about their motives.

133
00:07:44.410 --> 00:07:47.990
The spine master was simply delighted to recruit a couple from a neutral country

134
00:07:48.090 --> 00:07:50.150
who could move freely to Britain. A couple,

135
00:07:50.151 --> 00:07:54.230
which included a former nationalist veteran, an officer of the signal core,

136
00:07:54.590 --> 00:07:57.510
no less Lieser agreed to the deal and signed agents.

137
00:07:58.230 --> 00:08:01.340
Frederika NAPE to won a crash course on intelligence work.

138
00:08:01.560 --> 00:08:05.260
He was taught how to use invisible ink to write his secret reports that were to

139
00:08:05.261 --> 00:08:07.140
be sent back to Madrid and to Berlin.

140
00:08:07.820 --> 00:08:12.540
Juan also learns how to encode his messages using the enigma. Sys, finally,

141
00:08:12.760 --> 00:08:15.340
he received instructions on what not to do.

142
00:08:15.560 --> 00:08:18.980
He and athe were not supposed to do any actual spying themselves.

143
00:08:19.040 --> 00:08:23.130
Rather they were to recruit a spy network amongst British and foreign citizens

144
00:08:23.270 --> 00:08:27.050
who were sympathetic to the access. Cause everything it was set.

145
00:08:27.270 --> 00:08:31.770
One last detail was missing. Juan would need a code name to sign his messages.

146
00:08:31.950 --> 00:08:34.690
And they asked, well, do you have any preferences? Yes,

147
00:08:34.990 --> 00:08:38.810
he had athe Bella or Abel for short

148
00:08:45.260 --> 00:08:46.520
In July of 1941,

149
00:08:46.521 --> 00:08:50.160
the P Joels were transferred to Lisbon after requiring false papers.

150
00:08:50.230 --> 00:08:52.160
They flew to London and said to work.

151
00:08:52.350 --> 00:08:55.480
Juan P Joel did not have any particular talents nor education,

152
00:08:55.500 --> 00:08:57.320
but he did have the gift of the gap.

153
00:08:57.560 --> 00:09:00.160
And his wife had a charming personality very quickly.

154
00:09:00.190 --> 00:09:02.320
They started recruiting a network of spies,

155
00:09:02.430 --> 00:09:06.680
some of them high up in the hierarchy of the British Admiralty and the ministry

156
00:09:06.681 --> 00:09:07.514
of information.

157
00:09:07.620 --> 00:09:10.680
<v 1>The network included two Venezuelan brothers, Nazi sympathizes,</v>

158
00:09:10.681 --> 00:09:14.240
who were able to observe the Royal Navy's movements from Glasgow.

159
00:09:14.530 --> 00:09:15.910
In November of 1942,

160
00:09:15.911 --> 00:09:18.550
they were able to send an advanced warning of operation torch.

161
00:09:18.690 --> 00:09:20.510
The allied landings in north Africa.

162
00:09:20.780 --> 00:09:23.430
Another notable agent included a Welsh nationalist.

163
00:09:23.431 --> 00:09:27.470
The founder of an underground fascist group called the brothers of the Aryan

164
00:09:27.471 --> 00:09:28.040
world order,

165
00:09:28.040 --> 00:09:32.550
which was operating in Swanzi south Wales in the spring of 1944.

166
00:09:32.690 --> 00:09:36.900
The advert received the most valuable report so far from Abel,

167
00:09:36.960 --> 00:09:40.020
the long VI allied invasion of France. It was on its way.

168
00:09:40.120 --> 00:09:44.260
The joint British Canadian and American forces had created a new army group

169
00:09:44.320 --> 00:09:47.500
called FUAC. This stood for the first us army group,

170
00:09:47.540 --> 00:09:52.540
a formidable force numbering 11 divisions under general pattern FUAC was amasing

171
00:09:52.541 --> 00:09:56.210
in Southern England and plans were being finalized for their LA landing in a

172
00:09:56.370 --> 00:10:00.090
location in Northern France. Barbel was able to disclose that location,

173
00:10:00.380 --> 00:10:04.250
which as we all know, was C all, was it.

174
00:10:10.630 --> 00:10:11.690
<v 0>Now at the beginning of this video,</v>

175
00:10:11.770 --> 00:10:15.410
I did mention that this story features some unreliable narrators and the first

176
00:10:15.470 --> 00:10:18.560
one. Well, that would be me. You see so far,

177
00:10:18.670 --> 00:10:23.120
I've told you the story from the perspective of Lieser and the other spies at

178
00:10:23.121 --> 00:10:24.600
the ARB, but let's trace back.

179
00:10:24.601 --> 00:10:27.800
One of the very first reports sent by Arabelle from London,

180
00:10:28.240 --> 00:10:30.280
the Sid message folds back up into its envelope,

181
00:10:30.290 --> 00:10:33.600
jumps back into the secure briefcase and then into the postal plane.

182
00:10:33.601 --> 00:10:38.030
And so on until we are in the poo Joel's room in London with Juan

183
00:10:38.100 --> 00:10:41.670
composing the message at his desk, the cool breeze moves the curtains,

184
00:10:41.671 --> 00:10:43.950
allowing us to see just outside the window.

185
00:10:44.250 --> 00:10:46.950
But what we see is not big Ben or pick a deli circus,

186
00:10:47.310 --> 00:10:50.510
and Juan is not munching on some fishing chips. Now,

187
00:10:50.660 --> 00:10:55.510
what we see is the tour de be, and the PJs are having breakfast with pasta DETA.

188
00:10:55.770 --> 00:11:00.660
The fact is the PJs never left Lisbon for London. So what's going on?

189
00:11:00.770 --> 00:11:03.700
Well, let's rewind even further to the start of the war in Europe,

190
00:11:03.930 --> 00:11:08.300
even though Athelia and Juan were on the Francoist side at the end of the war,

191
00:11:08.450 --> 00:11:11.260
neither of them was fully supportive of the regime.

192
00:11:11.900 --> 00:11:15.140
Athelia simply found herself in nationalist territory while Juan had switched

193
00:11:15.580 --> 00:11:18.010
sides as a reaction to the violence in bar loaner,

194
00:11:18.070 --> 00:11:21.850
the young couple was concerned about the spread of Nazi ideology throughout

195
00:11:21.851 --> 00:11:25.450
Europe and had decided that they needed to take some sort of action.

196
00:11:25.680 --> 00:11:28.770
It's not entirely clear to us how they came to this idea,

197
00:11:28.771 --> 00:11:31.210
but in the winter of 1940 to 1941,

198
00:11:31.690 --> 00:11:35.450
Juan approached the British embassy in Madrid to offer his services as a spy,

199
00:11:35.830 --> 00:11:39.440
as we all have heard in many, a job interview, Juan was told. Thanks.

200
00:11:39.840 --> 00:11:42.080
So we appreciate the enthusiasm that we are looking for.

201
00:11:42.080 --> 00:11:44.960
Someone with a little bit more experience.

202
00:11:45.390 --> 00:11:48.560
What happened next was all thanks to athe genius.

203
00:11:48.980 --> 00:11:51.280
The plan was to approach the Germans instead,

204
00:11:51.281 --> 00:11:53.960
which happened successfully in January of 1941.

205
00:11:54.100 --> 00:11:57.640
The idea was that they would offer toy for them. Instead, once one,

206
00:11:57.920 --> 00:11:58.920
it gains their trust.

207
00:11:58.990 --> 00:12:03.120
They could then contact the British again and work for them as double agents.

208
00:12:03.510 --> 00:12:04.680
It's actually pretty brilliant.

209
00:12:04.940 --> 00:12:07.240
<v 1>Not only were they going to build up some work experience,</v>

210
00:12:07.300 --> 00:12:11.120
but they would be able to offer his majesty secret services, a valuable skill,

211
00:12:11.600 --> 00:12:16.350
a channel of community occasion with the Ava to feed false information to in

212
00:12:16.351 --> 00:12:19.750
July of 1941, they settled in Lisbon and never left for London.

213
00:12:20.050 --> 00:12:21.590
But what about their spine network?

214
00:12:21.700 --> 00:12:24.790
What about the Venezuelan brothers and the Welsh fascist?

215
00:12:24.791 --> 00:12:28.990
What about the detailed reports, which earn one, the praises of the Ave? Well,

216
00:12:28.991 --> 00:12:32.870
it was all fake a fabrication, Hoka, Popp hop, malarkey, cods wallet,

217
00:12:33.150 --> 00:12:35.100
mumbo jumbo Juan's gift.

218
00:12:35.100 --> 00:12:37.100
<v 0>With words, transferred into writing.</v>

219
00:12:37.400 --> 00:12:40.900
He was able to compose from scratch more than 400 letters,

220
00:12:41.460 --> 00:12:42.380
2000 wireless messages,

221
00:12:42.600 --> 00:12:47.140
all based on magazines and newspapers available in neutral Lisbon with only the

222
00:12:47.141 --> 00:12:48.020
help of his creativity.

223
00:12:48.040 --> 00:12:52.340
He was able to create an imaginary network of spices to ensure that the aver

224
00:12:52.341 --> 00:12:56.090
would trust Wan's that athe had another brilliant idea.

225
00:12:56.190 --> 00:12:59.090
The advert in Madrid were unaware that she had left with Juan.

226
00:12:59.190 --> 00:13:03.410
So she returned to the Spanish capital and met with Frederika NAPE.

227
00:13:03.670 --> 00:13:06.290
She broke into tears saying that her husband had suddenly disappeared,

228
00:13:06.770 --> 00:13:08.970
that he abandoned her. Then newborn son.

229
00:13:09.270 --> 00:13:13.050
She knew that Juan had met with Fred Rico several times and maybe he could help

230
00:13:13.051 --> 00:13:16.760
her finding him. Napa could not resist the tears of a beautiful young lady.

231
00:13:16.980 --> 00:13:19.280
And he reassured her. Juan was in London,

232
00:13:19.520 --> 00:13:24.280
carrying out a delicate mission on behalf of the Rike and athe should be proud

233
00:13:24.281 --> 00:13:25.600
of him. And with that,

234
00:13:25.990 --> 00:13:30.720
well now she had the advert in a pocket AHI and Juan were reunited once again in

235
00:13:30.940 --> 00:13:31.361
Lisbon.

236
00:13:31.361 --> 00:13:36.350
And he continued sending his coded messages to his I masters Juan's boldness and

237
00:13:36.670 --> 00:13:40.710
sheer Chi got to the point of asking for pay raises from the adva blessed his

238
00:13:41.060 --> 00:13:43.270
nonexisting agents stopped collaborating.

239
00:13:43.570 --> 00:13:47.270
The pujas ended up receiving 20,000 pounds from the adva.

240
00:13:47.271 --> 00:13:50.270
That's about 1.2 million in today's money.

241
00:13:50.710 --> 00:13:53.550
Juan came up with the story that he had been offered a job in the ministry of

242
00:13:53.551 --> 00:13:54.910
information. Thanks to some,

243
00:13:55.140 --> 00:13:58.740
I called Brendan bra and a personal friends of the prime minister,

244
00:13:58.741 --> 00:14:00.900
Winston Churchill. Thanks to this job.

245
00:14:00.901 --> 00:14:04.860
He was able to get access to even the office of the Lord Admiral Lewis Mount

246
00:14:05.300 --> 00:14:06.820
Baton by February, 1942,

247
00:14:07.140 --> 00:14:11.460
I six began intercepting Abel's messages via ultra the decryption program at B

248
00:14:11.740 --> 00:14:13.460
literally park that had cracked the enigma code.

249
00:14:13.530 --> 00:14:16.090
They soon realized that a German agent was based in Lisbon,

250
00:14:16.250 --> 00:14:20.290
but was actually pretending to be in London. He was also feeding the Ava false,

251
00:14:20.390 --> 00:14:22.890
but credible information around the same time period.

252
00:14:23.730 --> 00:14:25.650
Athelia planned her next move in a way.

253
00:14:25.670 --> 00:14:28.850
She was the literary agent to Han's creative genius.

254
00:14:29.310 --> 00:14:33.410
She produced evidence that Juan had secured the trust of the Germans and told

255
00:14:33.810 --> 00:14:37.680
RSO that they were now willing to cooperate with of the British secret services.

256
00:14:38.160 --> 00:14:42.480
Russo contacted M I six, who were now aware of Abel's activities. M I six,

257
00:14:42.481 --> 00:14:45.520
agreed to recruit the pujas who received another code name.

258
00:14:45.830 --> 00:14:50.520
This time B rail an operation was put in place to smuggle the pujas to drew

259
00:14:50.920 --> 00:14:55.040
Balta and then to Englands Juan adopted a new look to avoid any chance of

260
00:14:55.041 --> 00:14:58.200
recognition. He shaved his head and wore glasses and a beard.

261
00:14:58.700 --> 00:15:00.840
Now I don't know about you, but I think he looks pretty great like that,

262
00:15:00.860 --> 00:15:03.040
but I might be biased. Anyhow,

263
00:15:03.041 --> 00:15:05.880
the pujas landed in Plymouth on the 24th of April,

264
00:15:06.160 --> 00:15:10.120
1942 at the docs they were met by the third protagonist of our story.

265
00:15:10.180 --> 00:15:15.030
The I five handler who would effectively become Juan's fellow co-author agent

266
00:15:15.210 --> 00:15:16.230
Thomas Harris.

267
00:15:22.810 --> 00:15:27.630
Now let's look at the events of 1942 to 1944 from the point of view of the

268
00:15:27.790 --> 00:15:31.300
P drills and I five Harris, Chris and Juan,

269
00:15:31.301 --> 00:15:34.980
with his third and final code name because of his ability to impersonate.

270
00:15:35.000 --> 00:15:37.020
So many different characters on paper,

271
00:15:37.280 --> 00:15:40.900
he was called agent Garbo after Swedish actress, Greta Garbo,

272
00:15:40.901 --> 00:15:42.740
who was considered the greatest at that time,

273
00:15:43.060 --> 00:15:47.180
P Joel and Harris' strategy was to continue building the Germans trust by giving

274
00:15:47.181 --> 00:15:51.460
them so-called chicken feed, which is basically accurate military information,

275
00:15:51.810 --> 00:15:55.010
but of little to no strategic value working together,

276
00:15:55.040 --> 00:15:58.330
they wrote 315 letters averaging 2000 words. Each.

277
00:15:58.331 --> 00:16:02.010
They also invented 27 subagents each with full life stories,

278
00:16:02.240 --> 00:16:03.650
such as our old friends,

279
00:16:03.750 --> 00:16:06.970
the Welsh fascist and the Venezuelan brothers in Glasgow.

280
00:16:06.971 --> 00:16:10.490
According to the official history of British intelligence in world war II,

281
00:16:10.670 --> 00:16:15.080
the Ava became so flooded with reports from the Garbe spy network that they made

282
00:16:15.300 --> 00:16:19.080
no further attempts to infiltrate great Britain. In November of 1942,

283
00:16:19.360 --> 00:16:23.680
Harrison puel did one master stroke to secure the Germans trust once.

284
00:16:23.681 --> 00:16:26.160
And for all in anticipation of operation torch,

285
00:16:26.220 --> 00:16:27.800
the allied landings in north Africa,

286
00:16:28.070 --> 00:16:30.920
they compiled a report from the Venezuelans in Glasgow.

287
00:16:31.200 --> 00:16:35.310
There's a convoy of warships had been seen leaving port in distinctive

288
00:16:35.311 --> 00:16:39.110
Mediterranean camouflage. The message was sent by airmail postmark.

289
00:16:39.180 --> 00:16:43.270
Well before the torch landings and times to arrive too late to provide the

290
00:16:43.271 --> 00:16:46.670
German high commands with advanced warning, the information it was accurate,

291
00:16:46.970 --> 00:16:47.910
but it was useless.

292
00:16:48.040 --> 00:16:51.390
Still the Germans were delighted and communicated back to Garbo. We are sorry.

293
00:16:51.391 --> 00:16:52.270
They arrived too late,

294
00:16:52.290 --> 00:16:56.900
but your last reports were magnificent while Juan was writing away in the MI

295
00:16:56.901 --> 00:17:00.900
five officers Athelia was adjusting to life in London, which was not easy.

296
00:17:01.180 --> 00:17:03.300
Considering a second child had been born in the meanwhile.

297
00:17:03.530 --> 00:17:06.660
Initially everything was pretty great. She even got to meet the Duche of Kent.

298
00:17:06.880 --> 00:17:09.380
She also got to meet the prime minister, Winston Churchill,

299
00:17:09.700 --> 00:17:13.180
but soon the long hours spent at home and nostalgia for her country of origin.

300
00:17:13.710 --> 00:17:15.930
It took its toll in June of 1943.

301
00:17:16.000 --> 00:17:20.210
Athelia wanted desperately to return to Spain and threatened Thomas that Les she

302
00:17:20.211 --> 00:17:23.690
could do. So she would reveal the whole Garbo RS to the Spanish embassy,

303
00:17:24.090 --> 00:17:27.210
Juan and Thomas had to act quickly and they concocted another plan.

304
00:17:27.610 --> 00:17:31.770
And I five officer informed Athelia that Juan had been arrested following a

305
00:17:31.771 --> 00:17:35.800
violent altercation with the spy masters, who he accused of mistreating her.

306
00:17:35.900 --> 00:17:40.560
She was blindfolded driven to camp oh two oh the infamous MI five interrogation

307
00:17:40.561 --> 00:17:44.720
center, where she had a TIFF or reunion with Juan who appeared disheveled and

308
00:17:44.721 --> 00:17:48.280
downtrodden athe promised through her tears that she would do her best to

309
00:17:48.281 --> 00:17:50.200
cooperate from that moment onwards.

310
00:17:50.460 --> 00:17:54.680
All she wanted was for I five to agree to release her husband, the cunning plan,

311
00:17:54.700 --> 00:17:58.920
it had been successful. And here is a lesson for all you newly wordss out there.

312
00:17:59.010 --> 00:18:02.360
There is no marriage crisis that can't be overcome with the help of an overly

313
00:18:02.361 --> 00:18:06.560
complicated plan and a convincing disguise and an I five handler

314
00:18:12.770 --> 00:18:16.110
In January, 1944, Juan received a message from the adverb.

315
00:18:16.140 --> 00:18:19.590
They knew that the allies were preparing a large scale invasion of Western

316
00:18:19.591 --> 00:18:20.020
Europe.

317
00:18:20.020 --> 00:18:23.350
They needed their best agent Arabelle to keep them informed of developments.

318
00:18:23.380 --> 00:18:27.470
This set the stage for Garbos masterpiece. It was true of course,

319
00:18:27.471 --> 00:18:31.380
that a massive landing scheduled for June, 1944,

320
00:18:31.530 --> 00:18:35.660
operation LOR. The allies knew very well that its success depended on fooling.

321
00:18:35.661 --> 00:18:37.940
The Germans on the exact location of the landing.

322
00:18:38.180 --> 00:18:40.220
A parallel operation was put into place.

323
00:18:40.290 --> 00:18:44.220
Operation fortitude and Garbo would be at its center between

324
00:18:44.221 --> 00:18:45.500
January, 1944.

325
00:18:45.560 --> 00:18:50.450
And D-Day over 500 radio messages passed from one to the Ava with

326
00:18:50.550 --> 00:18:52.290
the intent of a concealing,

327
00:18:52.291 --> 00:18:57.130
the real status of overlords preparations and B persuading Berlin that the

328
00:18:57.250 --> 00:19:01.650
invasion force would land in C rather than Normandy. The deception.

329
00:19:01.910 --> 00:19:06.290
It was made even more convincing by the invention of a ghost army Fu sack.

330
00:19:06.430 --> 00:19:11.160
The 11 division supposedly led by pattern Fu sang was to be in the county of ES

331
00:19:11.480 --> 00:19:11.481
east.

332
00:19:11.481 --> 00:19:16.200
Londons the natural staging grounds for an invasion of C the allies even created

333
00:19:16.201 --> 00:19:20.160
inflatable tanks and other bogus equipment to full German connaissance aircraft.

334
00:19:20.340 --> 00:19:25.080
The German high command swallowed Garbos lies like chilled Bavarian beer on hot

335
00:19:25.081 --> 00:19:27.840
evening. Normandy beaches were well defended of course,

336
00:19:27.900 --> 00:19:30.120
but that was part of the Atlantic wall system of defense.

337
00:19:30.260 --> 00:19:33.430
The majority of the mechanized divisions in Northern France,

338
00:19:33.460 --> 00:19:38.430
they were kept at C ready to repel Fu sag D-Day it arrived on

339
00:19:38.431 --> 00:19:40.790
the early hours of the 6th of June, 1944,

340
00:19:41.070 --> 00:19:43.990
American British and Canadian forces stormed the beaches of Normandy.

341
00:19:44.210 --> 00:19:44.970
The battle,

342
00:19:44.970 --> 00:19:49.670
it was gruesome more than 4,400 men died on the allied side and up to 9,000

343
00:19:49.810 --> 00:19:53.940
on the access side, but it could have been much, much worse under, uh,

344
00:19:54.140 --> 00:19:58.580
in romel's insistence. The divisions were ready to move from call to Normandy,

345
00:19:58.581 --> 00:20:03.380
but he was overruled by the commander in chief Marshall VA rote another report

346
00:20:03.381 --> 00:20:04.660
from Abel or Garbo,

347
00:20:04.661 --> 00:20:08.900
if you like it reassured high commands that the attack in Normandy was purely a

348
00:20:08.901 --> 00:20:09.980
diversionary maneuver.

349
00:20:10.360 --> 00:20:14.410
It was better that the tanks stay in C ready for patterns. Arrival.

350
00:20:15.090 --> 00:20:17.690
Juan was so convincing that up until August.

351
00:20:17.830 --> 00:20:22.570
The Germans kept two armored divisions and 19 infantry divisions in Cali,

352
00:20:22.700 --> 00:20:24.770
ready to welcome pats ghost army.

353
00:20:24.990 --> 00:20:29.850
But how did the advert react when the allies never landed in C? Well,

354
00:20:29.870 --> 00:20:31.370
here's another Garbo masterpiece.

355
00:20:31.630 --> 00:20:36.360
He that the diversionary maneuver in Normandy had been so successful that

356
00:20:36.500 --> 00:20:40.960
the Cali invasion, it had just been aborted on July the 29th, 1944,

357
00:20:41.200 --> 00:20:43.600
Juan received a surprising, further message from the Ava.

358
00:20:43.740 --> 00:20:48.240
He had been awarded the iron cross by the fewer himself for his extraordinary

359
00:20:48.241 --> 00:20:52.200
services to Germany. And as if one award was not enough in December of 1944,

360
00:20:52.201 --> 00:20:55.960
Juan was appointed member of the order of the British empire by the security

361
00:20:55.961 --> 00:21:00.760
services director general, sir, David Petri and recognition over services.

362
00:21:06.980 --> 00:21:11.310
Juan AHI and Thomas had been at the forefront of an operation that had

363
00:21:11.311 --> 00:21:13.830
guaranteed the allies victory in Europe.

364
00:21:14.010 --> 00:21:18.750
It was one of those rare cases when actually the pen was mightier than the sort

365
00:21:19.270 --> 00:21:22.950
Juan and AHI, they returned to Madrid. Juan became paranoid about the Germans,

366
00:21:22.951 --> 00:21:24.150
finding out about his identity.

367
00:21:24.330 --> 00:21:29.220
He heard some ex Nazis or neo-Nazis could exact their revenge Athelia was more

368
00:21:29.221 --> 00:21:29.760
practical.

369
00:21:29.760 --> 00:21:33.660
She just walked into the German embassy and Madrid and collected the last sum

370
00:21:33.680 --> 00:21:36.380
due to Abel, which she knew was still waiting for them.

371
00:21:36.480 --> 00:21:40.300
25,000 beaders or about $20,000 in today's money.

372
00:21:40.440 --> 00:21:43.420
The couple then moved to Lugo. And from there to Venezuela,

373
00:21:43.610 --> 00:21:47.460
this was Juan's decision who was still paranoid about being exposed as ay,

374
00:21:47.530 --> 00:21:50.010
but life in Venezuela, it did not suit Athelia.

375
00:21:50.170 --> 00:21:52.490
And the couple they grew apart by 1948,

376
00:21:52.491 --> 00:21:56.210
they had formally separated and Athelia was living in Madrid with their three

377
00:21:56.410 --> 00:21:59.330
children in a penthouse provided by the British government.

378
00:21:59.550 --> 00:22:01.810
It was there that in early 1949, Quan,

379
00:22:02.010 --> 00:22:04.850
apparently on a secret mission in Angola had disappeared,

380
00:22:05.110 --> 00:22:09.320
was presumed deads in mysterious circumstances. His former handler and friends,

381
00:22:09.321 --> 00:22:12.480
Thomas Harris had quit. I five after the war in the following years,

382
00:22:12.481 --> 00:22:16.920
he could never shake off the suspicion of being part of the Sping known as the

383
00:22:17.480 --> 00:22:18.040
PBI five,

384
00:22:18.040 --> 00:22:21.960
a group of I five traders headed by Kim PBE who were spying on behalf of the

385
00:22:21.961 --> 00:22:25.760
Soviet union. However, there is absolutely no evidence of his involvement.

386
00:22:25.900 --> 00:22:29.630
Thomas died in a car accident in Maloca spare in 1964.

387
00:22:29.650 --> 00:22:34.110
And for once it seems like there were no mysterious circumstances in the

388
00:22:34.111 --> 00:22:38.230
meanwhile I Madrid athe had started building a new life for herself and the

389
00:22:38.310 --> 00:22:42.070
children working as a guide and interpreter for the British and American

390
00:22:42.550 --> 00:22:45.910
embasies in 1956, she met Anne fell in love with American entrepreneur,

391
00:22:45.911 --> 00:22:49.500
Edward Chrysler, the former body double for film star Rudolfo that Latino,

392
00:22:49.800 --> 00:22:52.740
who was now interested in developing the Spanish tourist industry.

393
00:22:52.880 --> 00:22:57.260
The two opened a successful souvenir shop in the same year marries in 1958,

394
00:22:57.261 --> 00:23:02.060
expanded into our galleries in 1965, all the while spying on behalf of the CIA,

395
00:23:02.400 --> 00:23:06.500
at least according to rumors by the newspaper El PA ACE Edward formerly adopted

396
00:23:06.680 --> 00:23:11.370
one. And athe three children who grew up in children of their own life,

397
00:23:11.760 --> 00:23:12.371
just went on.

398
00:23:12.371 --> 00:23:17.370
Francisco Franco died in 1975 king Juan Carlos' democracy was restored

399
00:23:17.590 --> 00:23:21.090
and Spain hosted the football world cup in 1982.

400
00:23:21.160 --> 00:23:26.130
Then on a September morning in 1984, Hare also known as Juan PRA Jr.

401
00:23:26.540 --> 00:23:30.920
Heard something on the radio that left him stunned. Juan PRA agent Garbo,

402
00:23:30.921 --> 00:23:34.720
the greatest Spanish spy was still alive and had just appeared in great Britain

403
00:23:34.780 --> 00:23:37.880
in order to formally collect the order of the British empire that he had

404
00:23:37.881 --> 00:23:41.360
received at the end of the war. This had been Quan's final roo.

405
00:23:41.460 --> 00:23:44.880
He had faked his death with the help of British intelligence to then return to

406
00:23:45.000 --> 00:23:47.240
Venezuela in Cognito and start again from scratch.

407
00:23:47.340 --> 00:23:49.800
He had remarried in Caracas and had fathered three more children.

408
00:23:50.320 --> 00:23:52.680
Juan was extensively interviewed by the Spanish media,

409
00:23:52.820 --> 00:23:57.600
but never gave an explanation to his action except that he wanted to rebuild his

410
00:23:57.630 --> 00:24:00.520
life. Maybe he had concrete reasons to fear retribution,

411
00:24:00.521 --> 00:24:02.760
maybe from ex Nazis who escaped to south America,

412
00:24:03.020 --> 00:24:05.750
or maybe it was just a way for him to divorce Puja style.

413
00:24:05.760 --> 00:24:08.870
After all divorce was illegal in Spain until the 1970s.

414
00:24:09.170 --> 00:24:12.870
And one thing we learned about Juan, if he could overcomplicate something well,

415
00:24:12.871 --> 00:24:15.750
he absolutely would. Whatever the reason for his disappearance,

416
00:24:16.110 --> 00:24:19.390
his children in Madrid welcomed him back and built a relationship which

417
00:24:19.391 --> 00:24:21.550
effectively had never really been there before.

418
00:24:22.110 --> 00:24:25.500
They even flew back to Venezuela with him and met their half siblings.

419
00:24:25.880 --> 00:24:30.100
Our story ends shortly after this reunion, Juan died in 1988,

420
00:24:30.101 --> 00:24:34.340
followed by AHI in 1990, both of natural causes,

421
00:24:34.650 --> 00:24:39.380
Juan Puja Garbo is celebrated in espionage literature as one of the

422
00:24:39.381 --> 00:24:44.140
great spies, if not the greatest spy of the 20th century. And well,

423
00:24:44.390 --> 00:24:46.370
we're not gonna argue with that. Butaro theory.

424
00:24:46.410 --> 00:24:49.890
Exploits have only recently been celebrated. And this is because, you know,

425
00:24:49.891 --> 00:24:52.730
being a good spy, she was very good at keeping quiet.

426
00:24:53.070 --> 00:24:57.330
So how about we remember both of them as the spies of the century before you go,

427
00:24:57.331 --> 00:24:58.490
please do believe as a comment below.

428
00:24:58.491 --> 00:25:00.690
If somebody was to film the story of Garbo,
