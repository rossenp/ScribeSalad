00:00:00.360 --> 00:00:04.560
<v 0>So by now, everyone has seen the declassified Pentagon UFO video,</v>

2
00:00:04.561 --> 00:00:09.270
which is of course the very first video ever released on behalf of the United

3
00:00:09.270 --> 00:00:12.960
States government of his so-called UFO or unexplained aerial phenomena,

4
00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:14.700
as it's commonly referred to as,

5
00:00:15.180 --> 00:00:18.150
and this is a few things that stuck out to me about this, which in this video,

6
00:00:18.151 --> 00:00:21.240
I'm going to connect the dots on some really interesting pieces of information.

7
00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:22.471
First of all,

8
00:00:22.471 --> 00:00:26.130
let's just address the fact that this is just another example of the United

9
00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:31.110
States government lying to the public about the topic of UFO's. For example,

10
00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:35.070
they claim for decades that the last time there was ever a program to research

11
00:00:35.071 --> 00:00:37.740
this topic was project blue book,

12
00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:40.530
which ran from 1952 to 1969.

13
00:00:40.560 --> 00:00:44.460
But first this just acknowledged that this 2007 to 2012,

14
00:00:44.461 --> 00:00:46.440
$22 million program on the Pentagon,

15
00:00:46.441 --> 00:00:49.260
like there's no way that that's the only program they've had.

16
00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:53.430
I don't believe it for a second. Second of all, what about area 51?

17
00:00:53.431 --> 00:00:56.520
Remember how they lied to the public about that for so many decades,

18
00:00:56.910 --> 00:00:59.460
anyone that talked about it was a conspiracy theorist and a,

19
00:00:59.461 --> 00:01:01.170
in a loon and ridiculed for it.

20
00:01:01.740 --> 00:01:05.670
That is until 2013 when the government themselves acknowledged that, oh yeah,

21
00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:07.890
it does exist. Now.

22
00:01:08.160 --> 00:01:12.630
That's also acknowledge that this story coming out now about this 2004

23
00:01:13.230 --> 00:01:17.040
incident that these pilots witnessed in their F eighteens was obviously a

24
00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:20.880
carefully orchestrated information dump. I mean, even, I mean,

25
00:01:20.881 --> 00:01:25.530
what are the odds that the New York times the Washington post and Politico

26
00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:29.400
would all release this story on the exact same day? In fact,

27
00:01:29.401 --> 00:01:33.300
the Washington post themselves state that they had been conducting confidential

28
00:01:33.301 --> 00:01:35.700
interviews for more than two months on this topic.

29
00:01:35.701 --> 00:01:37.800
So why is this all coming out now?

30
00:01:37.801 --> 00:01:41.280
And this is making a lot of people think that this is inching towards alien

31
00:01:41.281 --> 00:01:45.390
disclosure, that the government is prepping the masses to get ready for it.

32
00:01:45.690 --> 00:01:46.770
And others will say that, no,

33
00:01:46.771 --> 00:01:51.720
this is simply top secret technology and it's a disinformation thing and a PSYOP

34
00:01:51.721 --> 00:01:52.740
and all everything else.

35
00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:56.310
Here's the bottom line that we all have to realize and focus on for a moment,

36
00:01:56.311 --> 00:02:01.020
which is the fact that we now have scientific evidence of a

37
00:02:01.021 --> 00:02:05.610
craft that defied the laws of physics and aerodynamics. In fact,

38
00:02:05.611 --> 00:02:09.990
it had some sort of anti-gravity technology to where it could just hover without

39
00:02:09.991 --> 00:02:14.700
any type of signs whatsoever of an engine, a rotor wings,

40
00:02:14.940 --> 00:02:17.370
zero exhausting, a no heat signature,

41
00:02:17.640 --> 00:02:21.000
and it was capable of accelerating instantaneously,

42
00:02:21.600 --> 00:02:24.510
as far as the eye can see in less than two seconds.

43
00:02:24.810 --> 00:02:28.230
And we also have to keep in mind real quick that this happened in broad

44
00:02:28.231 --> 00:02:32.340
daylight. So when you saw this video through the IRR infrared footage, uh,

45
00:02:32.370 --> 00:02:35.550
keep in mind that, yeah, this is in broad day light and here we are.

46
00:02:35.550 --> 00:02:39.120
We only get just over a minute of footage of a five minute incident.

47
00:02:39.660 --> 00:02:42.210
I want to see the rest of the video. I want to see this thing hovering.

48
00:02:42.211 --> 00:02:47.010
I want to see it skyrocketing off. I want to see more, but not only that,

49
00:02:47.100 --> 00:02:51.690
they acknowledge that they have recovered material from crashed

50
00:02:51.990 --> 00:02:52.621
unexplained,

51
00:02:52.621 --> 00:02:57.150
aerial phenomena that is unknown to science metal alloys.

52
00:02:57.151 --> 00:03:00.910
So obviously created by intelligence that doesn't exist on this planet.

53
00:03:00.911 --> 00:03:04.390
So what are they telling us here? I mean, could it be any more obvious?

54
00:03:04.391 --> 00:03:06.880
This is basically a disclosure in of itself,

55
00:03:06.910 --> 00:03:08.320
but not everyone will agree on that.

56
00:03:08.321 --> 00:03:12.100
Some people are convinced that this is not aliens and for some reason,

57
00:03:12.101 --> 00:03:17.050
so many people have this adverse reaction to the word aliens take, for example,

58
00:03:17.051 --> 00:03:20.260
Neil deGrasse, Tyson. You may have seen his interviews on this topic and,

59
00:03:20.290 --> 00:03:24.070
oh my goodness. I mean, why he didn't take it serious at all.

60
00:03:24.130 --> 00:03:25.450
He laughed through the whole interview.

61
00:03:25.750 --> 00:03:29.410
He didn't even answer a majority of the questions and, you know, sidestepped,

62
00:03:29.411 --> 00:03:33.280
everything. He doesn't even acknowledge at all whatsoever.

63
00:03:33.281 --> 00:03:35.500
The fact that it had anti-gravity technology,

64
00:03:35.860 --> 00:03:38.470
that it defied the laws of physics and aerodynamics.

65
00:03:38.830 --> 00:03:41.320
He doesn't even acknowledge the fact that they have materials that are

66
00:03:41.380 --> 00:03:43.960
completely unexplainable to science.

67
00:03:44.170 --> 00:03:46.300
And instead he just laughs the whole thing off. And you know,

68
00:03:47.170 --> 00:03:50.020
this reminds me of a quote by Aristotle, which is,

69
00:03:50.380 --> 00:03:54.580
it is the mark of an educated mind to entertain the thought without accepting

70
00:03:54.581 --> 00:03:58.930
it. And the only intelligent thing that Neil Degrass said was that look UFO's

71
00:03:58.931 --> 00:04:02.680
doesn't mean aliens and yeah, I agree. It's like, duh. I mean,

72
00:04:02.980 --> 00:04:07.090
that's sure of course, but he just ignores everything else. And by the way,

73
00:04:07.091 --> 00:04:10.390
for somebody who is so adamant that humans are destroying the planet,

74
00:04:10.990 --> 00:04:14.830
he doesn't even acknowledge the fact that we now know scientifically that

75
00:04:14.831 --> 00:04:19.720
technology exists that can operate without a combustion engine that can hover

76
00:04:20.620 --> 00:04:22.300
anti-gravity instantaneous acceleration.

77
00:04:22.930 --> 00:04:26.350
And yet here we are filling up at the gas pumps, spending all our money there,

78
00:04:26.770 --> 00:04:31.330
the incredible ridiculous prices of airfare and obviously some sort of clean

79
00:04:31.331 --> 00:04:35.050
technology. I mean, regardless of whether this is from ETS or manmade,

80
00:04:35.290 --> 00:04:38.260
that technology now exists. It's out the cat's out of the bag.

81
00:04:38.290 --> 00:04:42.130
We know it it's been disclosed by the government and this topic isn't even being

82
00:04:42.131 --> 00:04:46.030
discussed by any mainstream media outlet. Don't you think that's a little odd.

83
00:04:46.450 --> 00:04:50.170
And now that we actually have physical material that is unexplained to science,

84
00:04:50.200 --> 00:04:53.920
we know that the military is handling the whole thing and we all need to keep in

85
00:04:53.921 --> 00:04:58.600
mind that there's not one single form of technology of any kind that has not

86
00:04:58.601 --> 00:05:00.460
been weaponized. Just think about that.

87
00:05:00.610 --> 00:05:02.710
And it gives credence to people that are saying that, look,

88
00:05:02.711 --> 00:05:06.730
this is just an excuse for the government to spend more money on space weapons.

89
00:05:06.850 --> 00:05:07.061
I mean,

90
00:05:07.061 --> 00:05:10.510
you've probably heard that the government is looking to create a sixth branch of

91
00:05:10.511 --> 00:05:14.920
the military, a space Corps to go along with the Navy, the Marines,

92
00:05:14.921 --> 00:05:17.170
the air force, the army, the coast guard.

93
00:05:17.260 --> 00:05:21.190
And this of course ties into orbital munitions, putting weapons on satellites,

94
00:05:21.220 --> 00:05:25.600
which would give any country just Supreme offensive abilities.

95
00:05:25.601 --> 00:05:29.020
You wouldn't need aircraft. If you could drop bombs from satellites.

96
00:05:29.470 --> 00:05:32.440
And this of course ties into what are called the rods of God,

97
00:05:32.441 --> 00:05:34.660
where they have developed a technology.

98
00:05:34.870 --> 00:05:39.280
Basically you have solid pieces of tungsten in the shape of a missile 24,000

99
00:05:39.281 --> 00:05:42.940
pounds, by the way, that have no explosives of any kind.

100
00:05:43.060 --> 00:05:46.090
And essentially is a weaponized meteor. I mean,

101
00:05:46.091 --> 00:05:47.920
meteors don't have any explosives, right?

102
00:05:47.921 --> 00:05:50.620
And yet they can destroy well a whole city, a whole planet.

103
00:05:50.650 --> 00:05:52.570
They can wipe out all of existence.

104
00:05:52.840 --> 00:05:56.830
It's all about that speed and the impact when it hits. So this is the,

105
00:05:57.470 --> 00:05:58.370
and it's illegal now,

106
00:05:58.371 --> 00:06:01.370
but this could be an example of them trying to push this forward. Now,

107
00:06:01.371 --> 00:06:04.340
something else that needs to be discussed and I've mentioned in multiple videos

108
00:06:04.370 --> 00:06:08.720
is the Pentagon missing trillions that are unaccounted for the Pentagon has

109
00:06:08.721 --> 00:06:09.980
without a doubt cook their books.

110
00:06:09.981 --> 00:06:13.820
And this story ties into August and September of 2016,

111
00:06:13.821 --> 00:06:17.630
where every major media outlet covered this, where essentially the pen,

112
00:06:17.660 --> 00:06:18.980
not essentially for a fact,

113
00:06:19.010 --> 00:06:21.860
the Pentagon has cooked their books and this is straight out of their own mouth.

114
00:06:22.010 --> 00:06:25.820
It's by the way, look into it. But trillions are unaccounted for,

115
00:06:25.821 --> 00:06:26.660
and without a doubt,

116
00:06:26.661 --> 00:06:31.400
it's clearly been utilized to embezzle or move probably hundreds of billions of

117
00:06:31.401 --> 00:06:35.360
dollars into black projects. Because again, this story in itself,

118
00:06:35.361 --> 00:06:39.080
the Pentagon UFO program was used with black money where essentially the

119
00:06:39.081 --> 00:06:40.100
senators, congressmen,

120
00:06:40.101 --> 00:06:42.740
even the president doesn't know where this money is being used for.

121
00:06:42.920 --> 00:06:46.280
So we have to acknowledge that with all this money and untold amount that is

122
00:06:46.460 --> 00:06:47.570
unaccounted for,

123
00:06:47.780 --> 00:06:52.100
we have to accept the fact that maybe just maybe this 2004 video is in fact us,

124
00:06:52.520 --> 00:06:54.740
but then the question becomes, how did we figure this out?

125
00:06:54.770 --> 00:06:58.340
And ended of course gives credence to the stories of crashed.

126
00:06:58.341 --> 00:07:01.670
UFO is being found. And thus here we are reverse engineering it,

127
00:07:01.910 --> 00:07:04.220
but do not be fooled into thinking for a second.

128
00:07:04.270 --> 00:07:09.020
This is simply just man-made because the same incident happened in 1952 and it's

129
00:07:09.021 --> 00:07:13.490
commonly referred to as the 1952 lights over Washington DC incident,

130
00:07:14.060 --> 00:07:18.410
where two weekends back to back the last two weekends of July in 1952,

131
00:07:18.920 --> 00:07:21.320
there was many different sightings.

132
00:07:21.350 --> 00:07:24.920
And this was observed from two different radar systems at two different

133
00:07:24.921 --> 00:07:29.330
airports. It was witnessed by many different pilots, both military,

134
00:07:29.331 --> 00:07:33.170
as well as civilian, including flight attendants and pilots on the ground,

135
00:07:33.171 --> 00:07:35.540
as well as in the air. And in fact,

136
00:07:35.960 --> 00:07:40.370
they even had jets chase down these objects to no avail as they were

137
00:07:40.371 --> 00:07:44.840
skyrocketing at incredible speeds, up down in every direction. In fact,

138
00:07:44.841 --> 00:07:49.760
they were witnessed on these radars documented at more than 7,000 miles

139
00:07:49.761 --> 00:07:50.594
an hour.

140
00:07:50.660 --> 00:07:54.010
So what I mentioned earlier with the government lying about UFO's their,

141
00:07:54.011 --> 00:07:58.580
their story for this is that, well, maybe it was related to a, you know,

142
00:07:58.581 --> 00:08:01.790
a weather inversion. That's why the two different radar systems saw this.

143
00:08:01.791 --> 00:08:04.820
And it was just obviously incorrect. Well, hold on a second.

144
00:08:05.150 --> 00:08:07.760
So just nevermind what all these pilots saw,

145
00:08:07.820 --> 00:08:11.930
nevermind the pilots at Tracy's craft and said that they skyrocketed into up at

146
00:08:11.931 --> 00:08:13.160
an incredible rate of speed.

147
00:08:13.340 --> 00:08:16.550
And they're doing 90 degree turns at several hundred miles an hour.

148
00:08:17.090 --> 00:08:19.700
Another excuse we had is that the pilots were seeing, uh,

149
00:08:19.701 --> 00:08:23.630
a ferry on the Potomac river headed towards Mount Vernon. Uh, okay.

150
00:08:23.720 --> 00:08:26.140
So first of all of these pilots, yeah, they're,

151
00:08:26.141 --> 00:08:29.810
they're too dumb to know the difference between a plane and a boat,

152
00:08:30.260 --> 00:08:33.950
but the story is debunked in itself because in, during this incident,

153
00:08:34.160 --> 00:08:37.940
these lights traveled as far away as Franklin Indiana,

154
00:08:37.941 --> 00:08:42.320
which of course the Potomac river doesn't even enter into Indiana. So no,

155
00:08:42.321 --> 00:08:44.870
it wasn't a ferry boat, but this is all smoke and mirrors guys.

156
00:08:44.990 --> 00:08:48.590
They put out a little of information to confuse people and just have put some

157
00:08:48.591 --> 00:08:52.280
doubt into the air and people just forget about it. But for no reason,

158
00:08:52.281 --> 00:08:55.590
should anyone think, I mean, this is 19 52,

159
00:08:55.590 --> 00:09:00.120
12 years before the Sr 71 blackbirds first test flight, even seven,

160
00:09:00.121 --> 00:09:02.250
six or seven years before they even put it on paper.

161
00:09:02.610 --> 00:09:05.400
And then you have these crafts traveling at thousands of miles an hour,

162
00:09:05.580 --> 00:09:08.760
90 degree turns at several hundred miles an hour. Like, no,

163
00:09:08.790 --> 00:09:12.420
there's no way that that was some sort of drone technology. And again,

164
00:09:12.480 --> 00:09:15.750
some people are saying because of this 2004 video that look,

165
00:09:15.870 --> 00:09:20.070
this craft was moving at such G-forces that the human body could not

166
00:09:20.071 --> 00:09:23.850
possibly survive through. So others will say, oh, well then it was a drone,

167
00:09:23.970 --> 00:09:26.520
which the pilots themselves thought that these were drones.

168
00:09:26.521 --> 00:09:28.080
But hold on a second, that reminds me,

169
00:09:28.350 --> 00:09:31.980
where's the rest of the footage of these multiple craft. All we see is one,

170
00:09:32.550 --> 00:09:35.510
you know, we need to start calling this UFO gate. We,

171
00:09:35.511 --> 00:09:38.610
we now know the government themselves have acknowledged that they have crashed

172
00:09:38.790 --> 00:09:41.460
craft. They have materials of unknown,

173
00:09:41.461 --> 00:09:45.570
scientific origin that were defying the laws of physics and aerodynamics and had

174
00:09:46.200 --> 00:09:47.430
antigravity technology and everything else.

175
00:09:47.670 --> 00:09:50.580
And basically the same thing happened back in 1952,

176
00:09:50.850 --> 00:09:52.230
this raises all kinds of questions.

177
00:09:52.231 --> 00:09:54.150
Like what does president Trump say about this?

178
00:09:54.810 --> 00:09:58.080
His press secretary was asked and she said she hadn't talked to him about it.

179
00:09:58.230 --> 00:10:00.630
And she would get back to everyone. And she never did. And that was like,

180
00:10:00.631 --> 00:10:02.790
what a week and a half ago, which by the way,

181
00:10:02.791 --> 00:10:05.850
the whole fricking press room laughed their asses off. When the,

182
00:10:05.880 --> 00:10:09.330
when the guy asked, oh, I have a question about, UFO's like, ha ha so funny.

183
00:10:09.331 --> 00:10:13.380
Right. But we only have to look at what other presidents have stated about this.

184
00:10:13.470 --> 00:10:16.620
Barack Obama in his first term said he had no knowledge of UFO's.

185
00:10:16.950 --> 00:10:20.220
And then when he was asked in his second term, he said, I can't reveal anything.

186
00:10:20.670 --> 00:10:22.680
Like how hard is it to say, uh, I don't know.

187
00:10:23.490 --> 00:10:26.460
Or even president George Bush said the same thing I can't,

188
00:10:26.490 --> 00:10:28.020
or I'm not revealing nothing.

189
00:10:28.530 --> 00:10:31.320
Or even bill Clinton say to that when he was president,

190
00:10:31.500 --> 00:10:36.090
he attempted to receive information regarding the topic of UFO UFO's and was

191
00:10:36.091 --> 00:10:39.420
access denied. So who's running the show,

192
00:10:39.421 --> 00:10:43.650
like did I misinterpret the constitution here who is really running things?

193
00:10:43.710 --> 00:10:46.380
It's obviously not the president. I mean, we've long known this.

194
00:10:46.381 --> 00:10:49.740
There's something like a dozen security clearances higher than the precedents

195
00:10:50.250 --> 00:10:53.490
and the same thing with this black money. That there's information that exists,

196
00:10:53.491 --> 00:10:57.840
that the president isn't privy to guys, who's running the show. So yeah,

197
00:10:57.870 --> 00:11:01.170
president Trump, if you are truly the outsider that you claim to be,

198
00:11:01.500 --> 00:11:04.350
we need more information. We need to see videos. This is again,

199
00:11:04.351 --> 00:11:06.180
guys call this UFO gate.

200
00:11:06.540 --> 00:11:09.630
They acknowledge in themselves that there's at least what, four minutes,

201
00:11:09.660 --> 00:11:10.201
additionally,

202
00:11:10.201 --> 00:11:13.800
that we haven't even been seen and who knows how many other incidents they do

203
00:11:13.801 --> 00:11:17.130
have documentation of this is where people come out and say, oh,

204
00:11:17.131 --> 00:11:20.190
well the masses aren't ready for disclosure, humanity can't handle this. Like,

205
00:11:20.230 --> 00:11:22.410
no, maybe you can't handle it.

206
00:11:22.410 --> 00:11:25.170
Or anyone that can't handle this information then okay,

207
00:11:25.200 --> 00:11:29.190
go live under a rock someplace while the rest of humanity progresses because

208
00:11:29.430 --> 00:11:32.640
it's 2018, the world seems to be getting crazier.

209
00:11:32.970 --> 00:11:35.490
So how have being told lies for so long,

210
00:11:35.491 --> 00:11:39.090
whether it's by our government and politicians, the news media,

211
00:11:39.420 --> 00:11:42.330
various religions, and certain aspects of the scientific community.

212
00:11:42.420 --> 00:11:43.920
How has that been working out for us?

213
00:11:44.190 --> 00:11:48.090
And I should also mention corporate America and lies that the CEOs and anything

214
00:11:48.091 --> 00:11:51.330
to make a dollar, how have these lies been working out for us, right?

215
00:11:51.690 --> 00:11:53.320
It's time for us to know the, the.

216
00:11:53.320 --> 00:11:56.170
<v 1>Truth is what humanity needs. But again,</v>

217
00:11:56.171 --> 00:12:00.190
the bottom line is that we now know beyond a reasonable doubt that this

218
00:12:00.191 --> 00:12:01.960
phenomena is actually real.

219
00:12:02.320 --> 00:12:05.080
And so we need to start taking it seriously and asking new questions.

220
00:12:05.350 --> 00:12:07.090
We need to know what the president thinks about it.

221
00:12:07.180 --> 00:12:10.750
And the public has a right to know more information than this.

222
00:12:10.751 --> 00:12:14.860
This is ridiculous. So everybody UFO gate put the word out,

223
00:12:15.490 --> 00:12:17.740
the more the masses make a big deal and stink over it.

224
00:12:17.741 --> 00:12:20.980
The sooner we'll get answers. That's how things work. So I'll leave it at that,

225
00:12:20.981 --> 00:12:21.800
but leave a comment.

226
00:12:21.800 --> 00:12:24.640
Let me know what your thoughts are as well as share other information that

227
00:12:24.641 --> 00:12:27.880
you're aware of involving this topic. But I'll leave it at that. I'm Jimmy,

228
00:12:27.881 --> 00:12:31.000
this is bright insight like and subscribe and, uh, yeah.

229
00:12:31.030 --> 00:12:33.100
More videos coming soon. Take care, everybody.
