00:00:01.180 --> 00:00:02.680
<v 0>Hey everybody, Jimmy here.</v>

2
00:00:02.950 --> 00:00:07.030
So this is a review and analysis of the Joe Rogan podcast.

3
00:00:07.031 --> 00:00:11.290
Number 9 6, 1 that played a day and a half ago with Graham Hancock,

4
00:00:11.291 --> 00:00:14.590
Randall Carlson, Michael Shermer, and mark defiant.

5
00:00:15.070 --> 00:00:17.770
So I got a few things to say about this. And in real quick,

6
00:00:17.771 --> 00:00:20.860
if you haven't seen the original podcast with Joe Rogan,

7
00:00:20.861 --> 00:00:24.040
where he's had Randall Carlson on a few times, Graham Hancock on,

8
00:00:24.041 --> 00:00:25.180
and the two of them together,

9
00:00:25.240 --> 00:00:28.990
you need to go back and watch those first because all of those or a buildup to

10
00:00:28.991 --> 00:00:33.220
what happened a day and a half ago, which was pretty epic. So real quick,

11
00:00:33.221 --> 00:00:36.970
where it stands right now, a day and a half after it aired on YouTube,

12
00:00:37.180 --> 00:00:39.610
it has just over 660,000 views,

13
00:00:39.611 --> 00:00:42.790
more than 15,000 thumbs up 900 thumbs down.

14
00:00:43.060 --> 00:00:45.940
And apparently that's just a fraction of the people that have viewed it because

15
00:00:45.941 --> 00:00:48.400
it's a podcast and YouTube is just a small portion of it.

16
00:00:48.850 --> 00:00:52.510
So let me just dive into this, let me start off with Michael Shermer,

17
00:00:52.600 --> 00:00:56.650
paid skeptic run skeptic magazine, and you know,

18
00:00:57.340 --> 00:00:58.121
how do I put this?

19
00:00:58.121 --> 00:01:02.320
Someone made a comment on Joe Rogan's YouTube podcasts saying that how I run it,

20
00:01:02.650 --> 00:01:06.490
that you have Michael Shermer as a skeptic. When in all actuality,

21
00:01:06.670 --> 00:01:10.810
he's just an establishment guy and Graham Hancock is the real skeptic because

22
00:01:10.811 --> 00:01:11.980
he's the one trying to, well,

23
00:01:11.981 --> 00:01:15.880
he's a skeptic of the establishment narrative that we've been taught in school.

24
00:01:16.300 --> 00:01:19.480
So I thought that was pretty funny, but when you have Michael Shermer,

25
00:01:19.780 --> 00:01:20.980
who's paid to do what he does,

26
00:01:21.130 --> 00:01:26.110
and he wasn't even able to speak to the theory of the water

27
00:01:26.111 --> 00:01:29.110
erosion around the Sphinx that just debunks the true age.

28
00:01:29.111 --> 00:01:30.700
You want to say theory. It's not really a theory.

29
00:01:30.701 --> 00:01:35.230
If you look into this yourself, the evidence is just overwhelmingly conclusive.

30
00:01:35.230 --> 00:01:38.770
And one thing I wish that was mentioned in the podcast, because he cited, uh,

31
00:01:38.800 --> 00:01:41.710
Robert shock and, and other geologists who have visited the site,

32
00:01:41.711 --> 00:01:45.130
but there's been hundreds of geologists around the world have that have visited

33
00:01:45.131 --> 00:01:47.800
the site of the great Sphinx and have said, conclusively,

34
00:01:47.801 --> 00:01:51.220
that the water erosion around the limestone bedrock is just, well,

35
00:01:51.221 --> 00:01:52.630
it's overwhelmingly conclusive.

36
00:01:52.631 --> 00:01:56.350
And it just completely debunks the narrative that we've been taught about the

37
00:01:56.351 --> 00:02:00.010
true age of the Sphinx and the fact that Michael Shermer wasn't even aware of

38
00:02:00.011 --> 00:02:04.900
this or able to speak to it. I mean, that's interesting. And to me, it's very,

39
00:02:04.901 --> 00:02:06.610
very indicative of the fact that he,

40
00:02:06.611 --> 00:02:09.880
Michael Shermer is not actually passionate about these subjects at all.

41
00:02:09.910 --> 00:02:13.000
He's just in it for the money. I mean, let me give you another example.

42
00:02:13.001 --> 00:02:15.100
He's never even been to the pyramids. And in fact,

43
00:02:15.190 --> 00:02:19.120
that sounds like he never even been to Egypt altogether, at least not Giza.

44
00:02:19.630 --> 00:02:20.680
I mean, think about that.

45
00:02:20.740 --> 00:02:23.680
This is a guy that is trying to debunk anyone that questions,

46
00:02:23.681 --> 00:02:25.000
the establishment viewpoint,

47
00:02:25.600 --> 00:02:30.160
but he was trying to defend that the oldest pyramids,

48
00:02:30.340 --> 00:02:31.173
if you're not aware,

49
00:02:31.210 --> 00:02:35.110
the oldest pyramids are the biggest and the most structurally sound and have

50
00:02:35.111 --> 00:02:39.640
clearly the best quality and craftsmanship and technological know-how and the

51
00:02:39.641 --> 00:02:43.420
newest ones, the smallest ones, the step ones are falling apart. They're,

52
00:02:43.421 --> 00:02:47.710
they're just, it's a complete de evolution of technological abilities,

53
00:02:47.711 --> 00:02:51.730
which makes no sense, right? Don't things get better over time. And anyways,

54
00:02:51.731 --> 00:02:54.370
the point that Graham Hancock was making with that is that, well,

55
00:02:54.371 --> 00:02:57.700
it just shows that there was some sort of advanced knowledge and over time that

56
00:02:57.701 --> 00:03:00.580
went away with the cataclysm point is this,

57
00:03:00.610 --> 00:03:05.530
that Michael Shermer for him to be so defensive of

58
00:03:05.590 --> 00:03:07.810
anything that is raised or questions,

59
00:03:07.811 --> 00:03:11.980
the establishment just goes to show what a shill he actually is. And,

60
00:03:12.100 --> 00:03:12.431
and by the way,

61
00:03:12.431 --> 00:03:14.620
I'm going to say some really nice things about him here in a second,

62
00:03:15.550 --> 00:03:19.420
but for Michael Shermer, to question even the human migration narrative, when,

63
00:03:19.421 --> 00:03:20.710
I mean, if you saw the podcast,

64
00:03:20.711 --> 00:03:23.080
when that slide came up with the Smithsonian talking about, oh,

65
00:03:23.081 --> 00:03:26.740
there's evidence of humans being in north America, 24,000 years ago.

66
00:03:26.741 --> 00:03:31.450
And here he was trying to debunk that when two sentences ahead of it was just,

67
00:03:31.900 --> 00:03:36.220
I mean, it was very telling and for him to even, I mean, guys,

68
00:03:36.221 --> 00:03:37.060
if you're not familiar,

69
00:03:37.061 --> 00:03:41.110
there's Aboriginal DNA from Australia in mummies and south America,

70
00:03:41.350 --> 00:03:45.580
but not north America. So you have, Schermer trying to defend this.

71
00:03:46.450 --> 00:03:50.980
Landbridge from Russia down through north America. And it's like, man, I mean,

72
00:03:51.220 --> 00:03:53.860
really I, where I'm going with this is where is this guy's due diligence.

73
00:03:53.861 --> 00:03:55.150
This is his profession.

74
00:03:55.210 --> 00:03:58.600
And I know he covers a lot of different topics on his skeptic magazine,

75
00:03:58.601 --> 00:04:01.420
but really come on and for him, and this is a good point.

76
00:04:01.420 --> 00:04:05.830
I'm looking at my notes here for Michael Shermer to say to Graham Hancock, Hey,

77
00:04:05.831 --> 00:04:07.990
wait a second, you have these theories,

78
00:04:08.410 --> 00:04:12.820
but all of these Egyptologists have your evidence and don't go along with it at

79
00:04:12.821 --> 00:04:17.290
all. Why is that? Isn't that indicative that well, you're wrong. You know,

80
00:04:17.291 --> 00:04:21.790
Michael Shermer for someone that does what you do, isn't it abundantly clear?

81
00:04:21.791 --> 00:04:21.971
I mean,

82
00:04:21.971 --> 00:04:26.950
I find it really interesting that you can't realize or know the reasons why the

83
00:04:26.951 --> 00:04:31.690
mainstream scientists and archeologists and Egyptologists would try to refute

84
00:04:31.691 --> 00:04:32.524
Graham Hancock.

85
00:04:32.830 --> 00:04:36.880
Do these people not have a significant financial incentive to do so.

86
00:04:37.390 --> 00:04:38.021
I'm what we're talking about.

87
00:04:38.021 --> 00:04:40.570
People that have had that have written books on the subjects,

88
00:04:40.690 --> 00:04:45.130
people that have had textbook deals or even written textbooks themselves,

89
00:04:45.460 --> 00:04:47.020
people that have been on live TV,

90
00:04:47.021 --> 00:04:51.730
people that have been tenured at various universities because of what they have

91
00:04:51.731 --> 00:04:55.840
suggested as far as the narrative of ancient human civilization.

92
00:04:56.080 --> 00:05:00.130
And when you have Graham Hancock coming to debunk them with actual data and

93
00:05:00.131 --> 00:05:03.430
scientific evidence, make no mistake, these people,

94
00:05:03.520 --> 00:05:05.650
their livelihoods are on the line. So of course,

95
00:05:05.651 --> 00:05:09.940
they're going to ignore and admit the new evidence and for the, and by the way,

96
00:05:09.941 --> 00:05:14.260
some of these people do not underestimate human ego and how denial works.

97
00:05:14.350 --> 00:05:16.510
It's a hell of a fricking thing, right?

98
00:05:16.870 --> 00:05:19.300
And let me just move on to one last point real quick about Schermer,

99
00:05:19.301 --> 00:05:23.590
which is him trying to debunk the possibility of an Atlantis,

100
00:05:24.250 --> 00:05:27.910
how many ancient civilizations across multiple continents around the world need

101
00:05:27.911 --> 00:05:31.170
to speak of a land that existed that was superior. Uh,

102
00:05:31.171 --> 00:05:34.750
as far as the civilization goes, that was wiped off the frickin map. You know,

103
00:05:34.751 --> 00:05:36.880
when a flood happened, the same period of time,

104
00:05:36.881 --> 00:05:40.480
that Plato talks about the same period of time that Meltwater pulse one B

105
00:05:40.481 --> 00:05:45.220
happened where you have 6 million cubic miles of

106
00:05:45.221 --> 00:05:46.750
ice sheets across north America,

107
00:05:46.751 --> 00:05:50.710
that melted in a very short window of time that, you know,

108
00:05:51.310 --> 00:05:52.150
come on, man,

109
00:05:52.151 --> 00:05:56.320
like really you need to see what boats and other things to back up the human

110
00:05:56.321 --> 00:05:58.760
migration or support Atlantis or other things.

111
00:05:58.760 --> 00:06:03.380
Like the one thing I wish that was mentioned in this podcast was that, look,

112
00:06:03.710 --> 00:06:07.250
you're asking to see more evidence when, you know, what's,

113
00:06:07.340 --> 00:06:10.700
we're talking 12,000 years, which is such a longer,

114
00:06:11.150 --> 00:06:14.750
a much longer period of time than most people appreciate because we hear figures

115
00:06:14.751 --> 00:06:18.050
like the dinosaur is going away 65 million years ago or whatever.

116
00:06:18.230 --> 00:06:21.410
So when we hear 12,000 years, we don't, it sounds insignificant.

117
00:06:21.830 --> 00:06:24.440
But I like to use the example of the Titanic,

118
00:06:24.441 --> 00:06:26.720
which I've mentioned in several videos of mine, which is this,

119
00:06:27.020 --> 00:06:30.920
you have nearly 50,000 tons of steel and iron that has been under the ocean for

120
00:06:30.921 --> 00:06:35.300
105 years. And it's more than 50% disintegrated in just a few hundred years.

121
00:06:35.301 --> 00:06:36.680
It will be completely non-existent.

122
00:06:37.460 --> 00:06:40.760
Now I know that things are road quicker and underwater, of course,

123
00:06:41.210 --> 00:06:42.770
but use cars as an example,

124
00:06:42.800 --> 00:06:47.090
you leave a car outside for 50 years and you could see through one door to the

125
00:06:47.091 --> 00:06:50.630
other, the cloth or leather leather seats are completely just gone.

126
00:06:50.720 --> 00:06:53.240
And the only thing left is Springs and like the car, I mean,

127
00:06:53.241 --> 00:06:55.790
how many hundreds of years, or even a couple thousand years,

128
00:06:55.820 --> 00:06:59.210
would it take for it to just be completely just absorbed back into the earth and

129
00:06:59.211 --> 00:07:03.680
just non-existent right. So when we talk about a period of 12,000 years, guys,

130
00:07:03.681 --> 00:07:05.420
everything's gone just like houses,

131
00:07:05.660 --> 00:07:08.420
how many decades before roof caves in the walls cave in,

132
00:07:08.720 --> 00:07:12.020
and whatever it was made up of is just nothing but gravel and dust and dirt.

133
00:07:12.021 --> 00:07:16.880
And just non-existent how many thousands of years, even if it was 5,000 years,

134
00:07:17.060 --> 00:07:20.210
when we're talking about 12,000 years ago, guys, you know,

135
00:07:20.720 --> 00:07:22.190
for Michael Shermer to not,

136
00:07:22.250 --> 00:07:25.940
to completely just reduce the significance of Gobekli Tempe and say that they

137
00:07:25.941 --> 00:07:28.160
need to see more tools like guys,

138
00:07:28.161 --> 00:07:31.210
we could probably go to Sears to buy a toolbox and a bunch of tools,

139
00:07:31.230 --> 00:07:34.640
just throw it in the dirt. And if we came back in 12,000 years, honestly,

140
00:07:34.641 --> 00:07:37.610
what would be left even stainless steel materials,

141
00:07:37.640 --> 00:07:40.940
what would be left at that period of time at that point, think about that.

142
00:07:41.390 --> 00:07:43.460
And for Michael Shermer to, you know,

143
00:07:43.490 --> 00:07:46.730
reduce the significance of go Beckley Tappy. I mean,

144
00:07:46.731 --> 00:07:49.670
I think Graham Hancock handled do well as far as well. I mean,

145
00:07:49.671 --> 00:07:51.530
he didn't handle everything well, I'll get to that in a second,

146
00:07:51.770 --> 00:07:54.410
but saying that look, the site itself is the significance.

147
00:07:54.411 --> 00:07:56.240
That's the big mystery, you know,

148
00:07:56.241 --> 00:07:59.090
when you have a site with hundreds of pillars that are enormous, I mean,

149
00:07:59.091 --> 00:08:01.910
nevermind how they cut and carved it, nevermind how they moved the stone.

150
00:08:02.450 --> 00:08:06.140
How were they able to align it perfectly true north? I mean,

151
00:08:06.260 --> 00:08:10.460
and not to mention 7,000 years older than Stonehenge, like I'm going to, I mean,

152
00:08:10.940 --> 00:08:13.760
I don't know anyone that reduces the significance of that. I would,

153
00:08:13.790 --> 00:08:17.810
I seriously questioned either their analytical thinking abilities or their

154
00:08:17.811 --> 00:08:19.960
intentions. And when it comes to Michael Shermer,

155
00:08:20.010 --> 00:08:22.760
it's not the analytical thinking abilities that guy's brilliant,

156
00:08:22.761 --> 00:08:26.540
he's incredibly articulate. And the fact that I clearly, in my opinion,

157
00:08:26.541 --> 00:08:31.010
he's in it for the money. He's an establishment shell, for sure. You know,

158
00:08:31.460 --> 00:08:33.220
Schermer, if you're in it for the money, I,

159
00:08:33.690 --> 00:08:37.640
you would make a lot more money if you bought into the ideas suggested by Graham

160
00:08:37.641 --> 00:08:41.030
Hancock, maybe not all of them, but even Randall Carlson. As an example,

161
00:08:41.450 --> 00:08:43.310
I guarantee you with your level headedness,

162
00:08:43.470 --> 00:08:47.240
that your ability to just not bite back when skeptics attack you, as we saw,

163
00:08:47.241 --> 00:08:49.760
I mean, you handled your, you had such a professional demeanor,

164
00:08:49.761 --> 00:08:52.310
like totally impressed by you. Um,

165
00:08:52.330 --> 00:08:54.440
I just wish you would have more of an open mind. Okay.

166
00:08:54.620 --> 00:08:57.420
And if you to have a note more of an open mind, uh,

167
00:08:57.450 --> 00:09:00.810
and you were to be on the side, you know, trying to debunk the establishment,

168
00:09:00.811 --> 00:09:02.700
which needs to happen, more people need to do this.

169
00:09:02.700 --> 00:09:06.660
The narrative is fricking wrong. I mean, have we not learned throughout history,

170
00:09:07.050 --> 00:09:10.950
just how wrong human civilization always is. Right. And, and, you know,

171
00:09:12.090 --> 00:09:15.720
then that brings me onto mark defiant. So man,

172
00:09:16.200 --> 00:09:17.790
what a fricking naysayer,

173
00:09:17.820 --> 00:09:21.960
how unproductive is this gentlemen for the entire scientific community and for

174
00:09:21.961 --> 00:09:24.900
the progress of humanity, make no mistake. If mark,

175
00:09:24.960 --> 00:09:27.810
if mark defiant was born 400 fricking years ago,

176
00:09:28.260 --> 00:09:31.740
he would have been leading the mob of naysayers and angry people that were

177
00:09:31.741 --> 00:09:36.480
demanding that Galileo will be tortured and executed for simply proving and

178
00:09:36.481 --> 00:09:40.770
validating the theories set forth by Copernicus that the earth rotates around

179
00:09:40.771 --> 00:09:43.530
the sun sounds harsh. Huh? Doesn't it.

180
00:09:43.860 --> 00:09:48.840
But think about what he did with his hit piece on Graham Hancock. Now,

181
00:09:48.841 --> 00:09:51.000
Graham Hancock, he just read off a few passages of it,

182
00:09:51.001 --> 00:09:55.160
but if you read it from start to finish, I mean, you really get a sense of wow.

183
00:09:55.500 --> 00:10:00.030
Who and why when someone writes something like that to be so disingenuous

184
00:10:00.390 --> 00:10:03.030
is the nice way of saying it. It was a hit piece.

185
00:10:03.060 --> 00:10:07.080
It was disrespectful and was very indicative of where his line of thought is.

186
00:10:07.590 --> 00:10:11.100
But that's not to say that mark font is an incredibly educated and he held his

187
00:10:11.101 --> 00:10:13.260
own against Randall Carlson. However,

188
00:10:13.560 --> 00:10:16.770
for him to try and refute some of the evidence that Randall Carlson presented

189
00:10:16.771 --> 00:10:20.640
involving the massive flooding from someone like myself who was really studied

190
00:10:20.641 --> 00:10:24.810
up on Randall, Carlson, looked at his works, uh, you know, visit it, you know,

191
00:10:25.680 --> 00:10:28.950
clearly marked a font hasn't and, you know,

192
00:10:29.760 --> 00:10:34.260
for someone to be so apprehensive against these ideas and to try and refute them

193
00:10:34.440 --> 00:10:36.660
when clearly, honestly, he's just off base.

194
00:10:36.661 --> 00:10:40.230
He's a bit wrong on a lot of things he mentioned, you know, it's like, dude,

195
00:10:40.231 --> 00:10:44.550
I think if you put his, his own ego aside a little bit and just chilled out,

196
00:10:44.970 --> 00:10:46.170
you know, it would help him a lot.

197
00:10:46.170 --> 00:10:48.810
And I would say the same thing about Graham Hancock, who, by the way,

198
00:10:48.811 --> 00:10:50.910
I just love, I would love to meet this gentlemen,

199
00:10:51.150 --> 00:10:54.330
go out for a fricking dinner and pick his brain or to have some cocktails or,

200
00:10:54.810 --> 00:10:58.530
or smoke a joint or whatever Graham Hancock is a brilliant, uh,

201
00:10:58.800 --> 00:11:02.280
he is he right about everything I would say, no, but you know, who cares?

202
00:11:02.310 --> 00:11:06.660
Neither was Einstein or, or Tesla. Right. Um, in the, you know,

203
00:11:06.661 --> 00:11:09.840
his works that he in, in research that he's done for the last few decades,

204
00:11:11.040 --> 00:11:13.920
you know, look, I was listening to this podcast in bed.

205
00:11:13.950 --> 00:11:16.590
I listened to par part of it one night and then finished it the next day

206
00:11:16.620 --> 00:11:18.810
yesterday. And my wife was listening and like,

207
00:11:18.811 --> 00:11:19.950
why is it getting so apprehensive?

208
00:11:19.951 --> 00:11:24.030
She was getting turned off by Graham for being so upset. Um, and I agree,

209
00:11:24.031 --> 00:11:26.190
you know, he wears his emotions on his sleeves, but you know,

210
00:11:26.191 --> 00:11:29.400
to give him a little bit of credit and yes, I would say in the future,

211
00:11:29.401 --> 00:11:31.590
I would like, I would love to talk to him and be like, Hey man, you gotta,

212
00:11:31.980 --> 00:11:35.160
you gotta learn how to discipline yourself to not push back,

213
00:11:35.190 --> 00:11:37.920
not to bite back at the skeptics quite as bad.

214
00:11:37.920 --> 00:11:42.450
But that being said for him to have been working on things that he has for as

215
00:11:42.451 --> 00:11:47.040
many decades as he has to present actual scientific data and evidence,

216
00:11:47.400 --> 00:11:50.400
and to be more knowledgeable than most of his critics on the subject matter.

217
00:11:50.401 --> 00:11:54.880
In fact, if not all of them to only be called, be ridiculed, shunned, and,

218
00:11:54.881 --> 00:11:57.820
and called names that are completely inappropriate and just ignored.

219
00:11:58.120 --> 00:12:02.080
How would that make you, how many decades could anyone stand up to that before?

220
00:12:02.081 --> 00:12:06.070
They'd finally be like, what the is going on? Excuse my language. So, um,

221
00:12:06.130 --> 00:12:07.900
you know, some people were very, uh,

222
00:12:07.960 --> 00:12:11.380
critical of Graham Hancock for getting upset. I see it both ways,

223
00:12:11.710 --> 00:12:15.220
but ultimately I think Graham Hancock handled the subject of [inaudible] very

224
00:12:15.221 --> 00:12:17.170
well. And you can see it in the comments.

225
00:12:17.171 --> 00:12:21.070
I would say at least three out of four comments were overwhelmingly supportive

226
00:12:21.250 --> 00:12:23.950
of Randall Carlson and Graham Hancock, uh,

227
00:12:24.010 --> 00:12:27.880
diminishing the perspectives of Schermer and defiant. You know, it's like,

228
00:12:27.910 --> 00:12:28.870
it reminds me real quick.

229
00:12:28.871 --> 00:12:32.740
I got to mention for Schermer to state that those cave paintings from 30,

230
00:12:32.741 --> 00:12:36.790
40,000 years ago were more oppressive or at least as impressive

231
00:12:37.390 --> 00:12:40.840
as go Beckley Tappy. I mean, that's lame,

232
00:12:40.841 --> 00:12:44.620
that's re that's a ridiculous comparison. And you know,

233
00:12:44.680 --> 00:12:46.780
so that brings me on real quick to Joe Rogan.

234
00:12:47.140 --> 00:12:50.950
I thought he was an outstanding moderator. I only saw a little bit of criticism.

235
00:12:50.951 --> 00:12:53.890
Some people saying that he interrupted Schermer and they didn't like that. Uh,

236
00:12:53.920 --> 00:12:58.090
no, uh, show Rogan, hint, if it wasn't for Joe Rogan, first of all,

237
00:12:58.091 --> 00:12:59.950
none of this podcast would have even existed.

238
00:12:59.951 --> 00:13:03.460
So mad props to him for bringing this whole thing together, making it happen.

239
00:13:03.461 --> 00:13:07.450
Right. But he held people accountable Schermer and defiant.

240
00:13:07.660 --> 00:13:10.870
If it wasn't for Joe Rogan, that conversation would have been much,

241
00:13:10.871 --> 00:13:12.610
much different. And, you know,

242
00:13:12.611 --> 00:13:17.080
people need when people are wrong and they're actively rebutting

243
00:13:17.140 --> 00:13:20.480
scientific data, which is really conclusive. And,

244
00:13:20.481 --> 00:13:23.050
and to anyone that hasn't seen the prior podcasts,

245
00:13:23.200 --> 00:13:24.640
and you're only coming into this one,

246
00:13:24.641 --> 00:13:28.960
the most recent you don't have the full picture. So Joe Rogan,

247
00:13:29.230 --> 00:13:33.820
in my opinion, did a fantastic job. And, you know, thank goodness for this, uh,

248
00:13:33.850 --> 00:13:36.850
for this podcast altogether, because regardless of where you stand,

249
00:13:36.851 --> 00:13:40.330
your viewpoint is on any of it. This is awesome for humanity.

250
00:13:40.420 --> 00:13:43.810
It's getting new conversations started and it's also painting a fantastic

251
00:13:43.811 --> 00:13:48.520
picture for the masses to see what truth seekers are up against.

252
00:13:48.670 --> 00:13:51.640
It paints a picture of what's been happening throughout history where the

253
00:13:51.641 --> 00:13:56.080
scientific community has always again gone against the new, you know, new ideas,

254
00:13:56.200 --> 00:13:59.650
whether it's Copernicus or Galileo or, or Tesla,

255
00:13:59.890 --> 00:14:02.470
or the fricking Wright brothers don't forget.

256
00:14:02.471 --> 00:14:05.140
The Wright brothers were being ridiculed leading up to their first flight

257
00:14:05.350 --> 00:14:07.600
moments before it don't forget what people were saying.

258
00:14:07.600 --> 00:14:10.720
Most of the mainstream was so against them, not everyone but most.

259
00:14:11.110 --> 00:14:12.760
So you have to understand that, you know,

260
00:14:12.761 --> 00:14:16.150
you can come forward with scientific evidence and data overwhelming.

261
00:14:16.390 --> 00:14:17.260
It's overwhelming,

262
00:14:17.770 --> 00:14:20.500
and you'll still have people as like don't even want to process it.

263
00:14:20.501 --> 00:14:23.650
And it's really unproductive. It's really unhealthy. But, uh, anyways,

264
00:14:23.651 --> 00:14:26.770
this podcast painted a great picture of it. So I'm going to close this up,

265
00:14:26.771 --> 00:14:30.850
but ultimately the evidence is there that the history of human civilization is

266
00:14:30.851 --> 00:14:32.530
far older than, than what we were taught in school.

267
00:14:32.770 --> 00:14:35.710
And we were far more advanced than we ever realized. How advanced,

268
00:14:35.711 --> 00:14:39.010
I don't know how far back do we date? I don't know that either.

269
00:14:39.400 --> 00:14:42.100
What I do know is that what they're still teaching in the textbooks about like

270
00:14:42.130 --> 00:14:46.540
say the cradle of civilization, the Sumerian 6,000 years ago has been debunked.

271
00:14:46.960 --> 00:14:48.730
Research is subject more on your own,

272
00:14:48.910 --> 00:14:51.410
but definitely check out these podcasts and uh, Hey.

273
00:14:51.410 --> 00:14:54.320
<v 1>Joe Rogan, if you're listening, uh, please bring me on your,</v>

274
00:14:54.321 --> 00:14:57.680
so someday I would love to talk to you about so many different topics,

275
00:14:57.710 --> 00:15:02.060
spirituality, DMT, frickin medical, marijuana, uh,

276
00:15:02.120 --> 00:15:05.330
ancient human civilization, the cataclysm, you name it, egos.

277
00:15:05.630 --> 00:15:09.320
There's so many things that, uh, I just love that you talk about. So anyways,

278
00:15:09.470 --> 00:15:12.410
I'll leave it at that. I'm Jimmy, this is bright insight like, and subscribe,

279
00:15:12.411 --> 00:15:14.150
leave me a comment. Let me know what your thoughts are.

280
00:15:14.390 --> 00:15:17.000
And I have many videos to comment, a whole wide variety of topics.
