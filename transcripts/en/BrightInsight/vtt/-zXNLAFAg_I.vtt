00:00:02.260 --> 00:00:05.910
<v 0>Does anyone else find it odd that they don't teach about the world's first human</v>

2
00:00:05.911 --> 00:00:07.150
civilization in school?

3
00:00:07.890 --> 00:00:12.270
The creators of so many things that we utilize all the time in our daily lives,

4
00:00:12.271 --> 00:00:15.110
more than 6,000 years later, including, well,

5
00:00:15.170 --> 00:00:19.590
the modern calendar that's right. The calendar based off of the lunar cycles,

6
00:00:19.591 --> 00:00:23.020
originates from the Sumerians. Most people are not aware of this.

7
00:00:23.200 --> 00:00:23.650
<v 1>In fact,</v>

8
00:00:23.650 --> 00:00:27.380
when I say that they're the creators of things we utilize all the time in our

9
00:00:27.381 --> 00:00:29.700
daily lives while I'm including time itself,

10
00:00:30.040 --> 00:00:33.980
the 60 12 base counting system that's used for measuring hours, minutes,

11
00:00:34.120 --> 00:00:34.790
and seconds,

12
00:00:34.790 --> 00:00:39.580
which is also utilized in basic mathematics and geometry for measuring degrees

13
00:00:39.900 --> 00:00:42.780
and angles minutes and seconds. In fact, the Sumerians are the,

14
00:00:42.850 --> 00:00:46.930
of creators of the very first writing system altogether also referred to as cane

15
00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:51.290
form, which was an advanced system that even utilized pictographs just as we use

16
00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:55.330
today, symbols, to represent entire sentences in this video,

17
00:00:55.430 --> 00:00:58.170
I'm gonna share with you many things that the Sumerians created.

18
00:00:58.310 --> 00:01:01.810
<v 0>In fact, even stories that originate from the most common religions on earth,</v>

19
00:01:02.310 --> 00:01:05.000
go right back to the sum. And most people have no idea,

20
00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:09.400
but for some reason they're not even required testing or even learning by the

21
00:01:09.401 --> 00:01:11.400
department of education. In fact,

22
00:01:11.401 --> 00:01:14.040
if you go to any history textbook through high school,

23
00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:18.560
you'll find only one to three sentences, total about the Sumerians,

24
00:01:18.610 --> 00:01:21.560
which are usually included in other paragraphs on other topics,

25
00:01:21.870 --> 00:01:24.270
such as the fact that they are the creators of wheel,

26
00:01:24.650 --> 00:01:28.430
but it's the things that they somehow knew about that we can't explain that are

27
00:01:28.431 --> 00:01:31.070
total mysteries. That'll also discuss in this video,

28
00:01:31.650 --> 00:01:35.350
but if you're not familiar with the ancient Sumerians that come from the cradle

29
00:01:35.351 --> 00:01:39.150
of civilization, Mesopotamia, the fertile Crescent itself,

30
00:01:39.370 --> 00:01:42.910
and we weren't even aware of the Sumerians altogether until more than 150 years

31
00:01:43.090 --> 00:01:44.190
ago upon the,

32
00:01:44.720 --> 00:01:49.620
of a massive cache of clay and stone tablets in modern day, Iraq and real quick,

33
00:01:49.621 --> 00:01:52.740
you can see here, they utilized cylinder seals to create these tablets,

34
00:01:52.840 --> 00:01:57.500
but at the ancient library of usher, Bon Paul in modern day, Moul Iraq,

35
00:01:57.770 --> 00:02:00.820
they found more than 30,000 of these tablets, many of which were broken.

36
00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:04.700
And this is also the same location where they found these infamous wing,

37
00:02:05.360 --> 00:02:08.370
some refer to them as the Aun or the sky gods.

38
00:02:08.371 --> 00:02:10.610
And there's so much speculation and debate about these,

39
00:02:11.070 --> 00:02:14.810
but this just happens to be the same site that I was at by some incredible

40
00:02:15.050 --> 00:02:19.850
synchronicity during my deployment to Iraq in 2009, 2010. And by the way,

41
00:02:19.930 --> 00:02:21.970
I still need to make a video about my Iraq experience.

42
00:02:22.050 --> 00:02:26.640
A lot of people have asked for that and explain how I went from brainwash sheep

43
00:02:26.720 --> 00:02:26.721
will,

44
00:02:26.721 --> 00:02:31.080
who bought the lies to thinking for myself and my journey to awakening as I call

45
00:02:31.081 --> 00:02:34.560
it. And I have a lot to say about it because that war was a massive scam,

46
00:02:34.720 --> 00:02:38.720
a money generating fraud scam, and an incredible crime against humanity.

47
00:02:38.780 --> 00:02:42.440
So look forward to that video in the future. But in these clay tablets,

48
00:02:42.441 --> 00:02:45.080
we've learned so many different things that they had created,

49
00:02:45.220 --> 00:02:49.350
not just or the wheel, as I mentioned earlier, but even the sailboat,

50
00:02:49.740 --> 00:02:53.590
they even set the platform for modern agriculture through the invention of the

51
00:02:53.620 --> 00:02:56.430
plow and even the seed sewing machine. In fact,

52
00:02:56.431 --> 00:03:00.640
the Sumerians created the first sewer systems, canals and irrigation systems,

53
00:03:00.820 --> 00:03:02.080
and they even mapped it out here.

54
00:03:02.081 --> 00:03:06.400
This is a plaque showing advanced sewer systems and water channels for

55
00:03:06.401 --> 00:03:08.520
agriculture and speaking of maps,

56
00:03:08.521 --> 00:03:12.160
they created those all together and they utilized them to create advanced trade

57
00:03:12.161 --> 00:03:16.640
routes. And they did this more than 3000 years prior to the silk road,

58
00:03:16.740 --> 00:03:17.680
the infamous silk road,

59
00:03:17.681 --> 00:03:21.310
which of course they who teach in school and they traveled more than 3000

60
00:03:21.320 --> 00:03:24.710
kilometers or nearly 1900 miles all the way over to Pakistan.

61
00:03:25.210 --> 00:03:28.270
And with these trade systems, it created an explosion of culture.

62
00:03:28.850 --> 00:03:33.670
The Sumerians themselves are the very first to utilize jewelry makeup and

63
00:03:33.671 --> 00:03:35.270
get this even beer,

64
00:03:35.560 --> 00:03:40.100
these stone and clay tablets annotate more than 500 different recipes for beer

65
00:03:40.560 --> 00:03:43.100
that's right. Craft beer comes from the Sumerians.

66
00:03:43.330 --> 00:03:45.940
Another interesting fact is that they created instruments.

67
00:03:46.330 --> 00:03:49.700
This stone tablet describes 23 different instruments,

68
00:03:49.701 --> 00:03:53.980
which include various types of flutes, drums, tambourines, and even the harp.

69
00:03:54.280 --> 00:03:57.580
You could even jokingly argue that they are the creators of entertainment

70
00:03:57.640 --> 00:03:58.660
itself. I mean, look at this,

71
00:03:58.870 --> 00:04:03.450
these tab here they are the first known conductors of wrestling or mixed martial

72
00:04:03.480 --> 00:04:05.570
arts altogether. At least that's been annotated.

73
00:04:05.990 --> 00:04:09.290
So what do they do with all this? The music, the booze, the makeup, the jewelry,

74
00:04:09.630 --> 00:04:13.970
the beer. Well, look at this tablet right here. Yeah, yeah. &lt;laugh&gt; okay. Yeah,

75
00:04:13.971 --> 00:04:17.250
you get what's going on there. And that's what almost 4,000 years ago,

76
00:04:17.570 --> 00:04:22.400
drinking beer and engaging in, in other forms of entertainment altogether. Now,

77
00:04:22.401 --> 00:04:25.320
like I mentioned earlier, the sums created the first writing system,

78
00:04:25.540 --> 00:04:29.320
as well as the first schools and privileged individuals went there and learned

79
00:04:29.321 --> 00:04:32.920
how to scribe themselves. And they just jumped right into it. In fact,

80
00:04:33.120 --> 00:04:35.600
they're the creators of the very first contract altogether.

81
00:04:35.980 --> 00:04:38.760
How hilarious is that? They didn't miss a beat with their trading systems.

82
00:04:39.500 --> 00:04:42.230
And then me guess what this says, pay up or else.

83
00:04:42.610 --> 00:04:45.990
But where this gets really interesting is that in these stone and clay tablets,

84
00:04:46.500 --> 00:04:49.990
they give credit to all their knowledge, not to any king or inventor,

85
00:04:50.450 --> 00:04:54.550
but they say that all the knowledge was given to them by other beings, the Aun,

86
00:04:54.600 --> 00:04:57.470
which means from heaven to earth came and many people,

87
00:04:57.471 --> 00:04:59.350
when they look at these various tablets,

88
00:04:59.351 --> 00:05:03.300
they speculate that this is where ancient astronaut hypothesis came from.

89
00:05:03.301 --> 00:05:05.740
And maybe you're familiar with Zacharia sitin.

90
00:05:05.840 --> 00:05:09.220
Now this is a subject I have to make a video on altogether about the, an NAI,

91
00:05:09.240 --> 00:05:11.180
my thoughts on Zacharia sitin and everything.

92
00:05:11.300 --> 00:05:12.660
I I've looked into this quite a bit.

93
00:05:13.260 --> 00:05:15.460
I know that there's a lot of speculation out there,

94
00:05:15.461 --> 00:05:18.780
and I don't agree with everything that people have stated about these ancient

95
00:05:18.781 --> 00:05:20.180
astronaut hypothesis. I mean,

96
00:05:20.181 --> 00:05:22.650
you don't see me saying that the alien has created the pyramids,

97
00:05:22.950 --> 00:05:25.650
but it is interesting that they give credit to others for everything.

98
00:05:25.650 --> 00:05:28.450
They have all the knowledge. Now people think that that's of course,

99
00:05:28.451 --> 00:05:31.290
symbolism for something else, angels, you know, the gods.

100
00:05:31.291 --> 00:05:33.010
So let's discuss what the Samari said.

101
00:05:33.011 --> 00:05:35.330
They knew about that was later determined to be correct.

102
00:05:35.840 --> 00:05:37.210
Take the story of the great flood.

103
00:05:37.230 --> 00:05:40.490
You may be familiar with that from more than 500 different civilizations,

104
00:05:40.491 --> 00:05:43.560
across five continents around the world that science,

105
00:05:43.700 --> 00:05:45.920
the most recent data proves actually did happen.

106
00:05:46.430 --> 00:05:48.680
Core eye samples taken from Greenland and Antarctica.

107
00:05:48.820 --> 00:05:50.320
And I've discussed this in other videos,

108
00:05:50.790 --> 00:05:53.400
they illustrate that at the height of the last ice age,

109
00:05:53.760 --> 00:05:56.400
the earth sea levels were 425 feet lower than today.

110
00:05:56.460 --> 00:05:58.760
And over a few thousand years, it slowly rose,

111
00:05:58.780 --> 00:06:02.240
but there's these huge spikes that happened that confirm that there were sudden

112
00:06:02.250 --> 00:06:06.000
rapid and essentially incredible increases in the global sea levels.

113
00:06:06.380 --> 00:06:09.080
So in other words, the Sumerians were right. The flood did happen.

114
00:06:09.420 --> 00:06:12.960
And it's interesting that mainstream academics and scientists still referred to

115
00:06:12.961 --> 00:06:13.660
it as a myth,

116
00:06:13.660 --> 00:06:17.190
but what's even more interesting than the denial is the fact that the Sumerians

117
00:06:17.191 --> 00:06:22.030
knew about this 6,000 years after the fact is when they were writing this stuff

118
00:06:22.031 --> 00:06:26.070
down on the tablet. So it really makes you think, now look at this tablet here.

119
00:06:26.220 --> 00:06:30.590
This is the one, this is very notable, the infamous solar system tablet. I mean,

120
00:06:30.591 --> 00:06:33.510
just look at this for yourself. What do you see there? I mean,

121
00:06:33.570 --> 00:06:37.940
how could they possibly have known about planets around the sun

122
00:06:38.280 --> 00:06:39.700
6,000 years ago? I mean,

123
00:06:39.950 --> 00:06:44.260
isn't that more than 5,000 years before Copernicus identified that planets

124
00:06:44.261 --> 00:06:48.100
rotated around the sun in just the same period of time before even the first

125
00:06:48.101 --> 00:06:49.260
telescope was invented.

126
00:06:49.261 --> 00:06:52.740
Wouldn't you need a telescope to know that there was planets out there and not

127
00:06:52.741 --> 00:06:55.140
to mention didn't everyone think that the earth was flat back then,

128
00:06:55.560 --> 00:06:58.850
how did they know this stuff? And so just to clarify mainstream,

129
00:06:58.880 --> 00:07:01.090
they will say that no, none of these are planets.

130
00:07:01.270 --> 00:07:06.010
All of these are stars and there's even a website devoted to debunking Zacharia

131
00:07:06.290 --> 00:07:08.810
CI in which is called, get this CI in is wrong.com.

132
00:07:08.830 --> 00:07:12.610
And I took a look at this and the point that this guy had was that CI in didn't

133
00:07:12.611 --> 00:07:15.570
even read the Cana form on the tablet itself.

134
00:07:16.230 --> 00:07:19.880
And he describes that he ills traits what it stated in his PDF.

135
00:07:20.100 --> 00:07:21.040
So I clicked on that.

136
00:07:21.980 --> 00:07:25.840
And 14 pages basically discussed the fact that since this tablet doesn't say

137
00:07:26.040 --> 00:07:30.880
anything about stars or planets, then yeah, it's just wrong altogether. I mean,

138
00:07:31.080 --> 00:07:34.440
go, just look at this and think for yourself. I mean, what do you, what is that?

139
00:07:35.020 --> 00:07:37.800
And this creates all kinds of other speculation because it's like, wait,

140
00:07:37.960 --> 00:07:41.710
is there, are there a lot oven, planets? And so, okay. Is Pluto a planet?

141
00:07:41.940 --> 00:07:42.751
Like gimme a break?

142
00:07:42.751 --> 00:07:46.630
What a stupid discussion that is some scientists that wanna redefine things who

143
00:07:46.640 --> 00:07:49.990
cares how far away it is or how small it is, like grow up.

144
00:07:50.250 --> 00:07:52.550
But this raises other questions too, about the asteroid belt.

145
00:07:52.580 --> 00:07:53.910
I've discussed this in other videos,

146
00:07:53.911 --> 00:07:56.830
it's clearly that was a planet or a massive moon or something.

147
00:07:56.831 --> 00:08:00.300
Something collided scientists will, it happened millions of years ago,

148
00:08:00.301 --> 00:08:03.300
but they clearly don't have enough variables to make that conclusion. I mean,

149
00:08:03.400 --> 00:08:05.260
you would need to know the size of these objects.

150
00:08:05.261 --> 00:08:08.180
You'd need to know the direction as well as speed of the collision.

151
00:08:08.360 --> 00:08:12.180
So they can't say how long ago that was. But when you look at these tablets,

152
00:08:12.560 --> 00:08:15.940
is it possible that this could be communicating the so-called ninth planet that

153
00:08:15.941 --> 00:08:19.460
they know exists? All the data proves that this ninth,

154
00:08:19.640 --> 00:08:24.610
this massive knife planet four or five times the mass of earth itself was

155
00:08:24.810 --> 00:08:28.490
creating a tilt and Neptune in Uranus. And that's how they discovered it. Well,

156
00:08:28.491 --> 00:08:30.250
they haven't discovered it. They're looking for it.

157
00:08:30.400 --> 00:08:32.570
It's obviously incredibly far away. And,

158
00:08:32.890 --> 00:08:35.450
and my guess is that it probably has a completely different orbit altogether,

159
00:08:35.950 --> 00:08:37.010
but they know it's out there.

160
00:08:37.510 --> 00:08:41.600
And yet here's this tablet from 6,000 years that shows these things.

161
00:08:41.660 --> 00:08:42.480
And by the way,

162
00:08:42.480 --> 00:08:45.640
Zacharia CI is the one that was saying that there was another planet out there

163
00:08:45.641 --> 00:08:48.920
and here it was ver validated 40 years later. That's interesting,

164
00:08:49.060 --> 00:08:51.200
but these tablets contain other information as well.

165
00:08:51.710 --> 00:08:56.000
Take a look at these tablets. And there are others that show seven stars,

166
00:08:56.050 --> 00:08:58.280
seven planets, seven something, seven dots,

167
00:08:58.300 --> 00:09:01.520
and many will say that this is just probably indicative of the platey star

168
00:09:01.540 --> 00:09:05.200
system, seven stars. But I mean, why isn't it in the shape of it?

169
00:09:05.660 --> 00:09:09.680
And what's interesting is that people that identify with the ancient astronaut

170
00:09:09.681 --> 00:09:11.360
hypothesis is that, look, if you were coming,

171
00:09:11.780 --> 00:09:14.360
if you were coming from someplace else, beings from another,

172
00:09:14.710 --> 00:09:15.750
at visiting our solar system,

173
00:09:15.751 --> 00:09:18.550
you would need to pass by seven planets to get to earth.

174
00:09:18.550 --> 00:09:21.150
It's an interesting theory. And by the way,

175
00:09:21.151 --> 00:09:23.390
look at this tablet that shows one of those wing bulls.

176
00:09:23.770 --> 00:09:26.950
Here's something else also worth thinking about is that there's suggestive

177
00:09:27.150 --> 00:09:30.390
evidence that the Sumerians somehow knew about the great year cycle.

178
00:09:30.490 --> 00:09:34.830
The Earth's tilt and procession 25,920 year cycle.

179
00:09:35.020 --> 00:09:38.260
And when you consider their awareness of the Zodiac and a few other factors with

180
00:09:38.261 --> 00:09:39.140
their counting system,

181
00:09:39.440 --> 00:09:43.260
you could make an argument that they somehow knew about this cycle. And I mean,

182
00:09:43.660 --> 00:09:46.700
thousands of years before the mines figured that out, and that's a mystery,

183
00:09:46.820 --> 00:09:50.780
you know, itself too, because we're talking one degree every 72 years.

184
00:09:50.960 --> 00:09:54.900
And back then the lifespan was what half the age of what is today.

185
00:09:54.901 --> 00:09:57.890
So to figure the, that out is beyond impressive and it's a mystery,

186
00:09:58.030 --> 00:10:01.130
but to wrap this up, that's not forget. They knew about time, the calendar,

187
00:10:01.200 --> 00:10:05.490
they created all these amazing things they knew about the flood six or 7,000

188
00:10:05.491 --> 00:10:08.770
years after the fact they even knew. And by the way,

189
00:10:08.771 --> 00:10:11.450
when going back to that religion, uh, comment that I made at the beginning,

190
00:10:11.451 --> 00:10:14.930
this video, the story of Moses from the Bible is identical.

191
00:10:15.200 --> 00:10:20.200
Literally I identical to king Sargon of a Cod from 4,000 years ago,

192
00:10:20.201 --> 00:10:23.280
right out of the same region. So without a doubt,

193
00:10:23.320 --> 00:10:27.680
I think there's a religious factor in preventing people from learning about this

194
00:10:27.681 --> 00:10:30.520
information. I mean, isn't that fascinating? The story of creation,

195
00:10:30.660 --> 00:10:34.200
the flood Moses, and a few other things come right out of ancient sum air,

196
00:10:34.380 --> 00:10:35.720
and nobody knows about it.

197
00:10:36.360 --> 00:10:40.110
They only teach us one to three sentences in school and they don't really teach

198
00:10:40.111 --> 00:10:40.551
that. I mean,

199
00:10:40.551 --> 00:10:44.310
I didn't know about the sums until watching documentaries later on in life.

200
00:10:44.810 --> 00:10:47.830
So we have to start asking ourselves, why are these tablets being ignored?

201
00:10:47.850 --> 00:10:51.270
And just to paint you a picture out of these tens of thousands of tablets,

202
00:10:51.271 --> 00:10:52.590
most of which are not on display.

203
00:10:52.690 --> 00:10:56.470
And they're literally gathering dust and the basements of various museums

204
00:10:56.471 --> 00:10:58.620
throughout world. And to make it even worse.

205
00:10:58.650 --> 00:11:02.740
Most of these tablets were only interpreted once by one person more than a

206
00:11:02.741 --> 00:11:05.580
hundred years ago. So these things need to be revisited.

207
00:11:05.581 --> 00:11:08.340
People need to look at them and the discussion needs to open up that clearly

208
00:11:08.370 --> 00:11:11.380
they knew about things they weren't supposed to know about planets rotating

209
00:11:11.381 --> 00:11:12.860
around the sun without, I mean,

210
00:11:12.861 --> 00:11:16.180
5,000 years before telescope guys look at this stuff,

211
00:11:16.181 --> 00:11:20.210
think for yourself a I'll wrap it up here. I'm Jimmy, this is bright insight.

212
00:11:20.450 --> 00:11:22.770
Like, can subscribe, let me a comment. Let me know what your thoughts are.

213
00:11:23.030 --> 00:11:25.770
And I have many other videos to come and a whole wide variety of topics.
