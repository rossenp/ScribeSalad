00:00:00.780 --> 00:00:04.800
<v 0>Do you remember back in school when they said that the stone blocks cut by the</v>

2
00:00:04.801 --> 00:00:09.360
ancient Egyptians were so precise that you couldn't fit a razor blade or even a

3
00:00:09.361 --> 00:00:13.600
human hair in between them? Well, this is what they meant.

4
00:00:14.310 --> 00:00:19.240
Look at that the precision cut of these massive and extremely

5
00:00:19.241 --> 00:00:23.910
hard granite blocks is so unbelievably exact that it's difficult to even

6
00:00:23.911 --> 00:00:28.190
differentiate the two stones together, the high definition camera itself,

7
00:00:28.191 --> 00:00:31.910
despite all its mega pixels struggles to pick up this line.

8
00:00:32.100 --> 00:00:36.910
It's something that can only be truly appreciated when viewed in person with the

9
00:00:36.911 --> 00:00:39.510
naked eye. And if you think this is impressive,

10
00:00:39.940 --> 00:00:43.700
wait until you see the photos from other parts of ancient Egypt that I'm gonna

11
00:00:43.701 --> 00:00:44.780
show you later in this video.

12
00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:50.100
But what you're seeing here are the enormous polygonal stone blocks that make

13
00:00:50.300 --> 00:00:51.340
up the valley temple,

14
00:00:51.341 --> 00:00:54.980
which is located in front of the great Finks and Giza Egypt.

15
00:00:55.650 --> 00:00:59.700
This is one of those sites that most people are unaware of as the great Finks

16
00:00:59.701 --> 00:01:03.770
and the pyramids get all the attention, but it is without a doubt,

17
00:01:04.190 --> 00:01:07.490
one of the most spectacular sites found from ancient Egypt.

18
00:01:08.120 --> 00:01:12.890
Many of these rose granite blocks are well over 30 tons of piece.

19
00:01:13.040 --> 00:01:13.873
However,

20
00:01:14.230 --> 00:01:18.450
the immense difficulty to construct a temple made out of polygonal shaped

21
00:01:18.451 --> 00:01:21.450
granite piece together as if a tight fitted puzzle,

22
00:01:21.970 --> 00:01:26.640
it is next level difficulty made to last millennia and survive even the

23
00:01:26.641 --> 00:01:30.520
strongest of earthquakes. And when I said that these stones are massive,

24
00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:34.600
you have to compare them to people to truly appreciate their size.

25
00:01:35.260 --> 00:01:39.080
And that's me there I'm five foot, 10 or 178 centimeters.

26
00:01:39.670 --> 00:01:42.200
Even with this photo, you can't truly,

27
00:01:43.010 --> 00:01:45.350
as this was shot with an ultra wide camera lens,

28
00:01:45.680 --> 00:01:48.830
which distorts the true size and the bulk of these blocks,

29
00:01:48.831 --> 00:01:50.230
particularly their widths.

30
00:01:50.690 --> 00:01:54.470
It does not do it justice for what your eyes witness here in person. And,

31
00:01:54.670 --> 00:01:55.420
and by the way,

32
00:01:55.420 --> 00:02:00.350
this particular block is closer to 50 tons in weight and brought from more than

33
00:02:00.580 --> 00:02:02.510
500 miles away,

34
00:02:02.511 --> 00:02:07.500
which the experts theorize must have been carried by boat down the Nile

35
00:02:07.501 --> 00:02:08.380
river. However,

36
00:02:09.160 --> 00:02:13.780
the bizarre reality is that even the largest known ancient Egyptian boat ever

37
00:02:13.790 --> 00:02:18.380
found couldn't possibly sustain even a fraction of the weight of these

38
00:02:18.520 --> 00:02:21.500
stones make no mistake. The mystery is real.

39
00:02:21.710 --> 00:02:26.330
Hence why there is a surging us by millions of people from around the world into

40
00:02:26.331 --> 00:02:27.330
our lost ancient past.

41
00:02:28.310 --> 00:02:32.330
But that aside in going back to the unbelievable precision that makes up these

42
00:02:32.390 --> 00:02:33.223
stones,

43
00:02:33.230 --> 00:02:37.370
notice that from a distance you can't possibly appreciate just how tightly cut

44
00:02:37.430 --> 00:02:38.570
and formed together. They are.

45
00:02:39.070 --> 00:02:41.770
You see many of these blocks are cut with rounded edges,

46
00:02:41.880 --> 00:02:45.400
thus creating a sea or groove a of sorts between the blocks.

47
00:02:46.180 --> 00:02:47.320
But when you get up close,

48
00:02:47.380 --> 00:02:51.960
you can see that in the middle of these seams is a cut so perfect that they are

49
00:02:51.961 --> 00:02:54.880
completely flushed together as if they were laser cut. In fact,

50
00:02:55.110 --> 00:02:59.520
they almost look fused together and you'll find awesome examples all throughout

51
00:02:59.521 --> 00:03:04.200
this magnificent structure. Take this example here from a bit of a distance,

52
00:03:04.201 --> 00:03:06.680
you wouldn't realize just how exact the cut is. Again,

53
00:03:06.740 --> 00:03:08.360
due to the breadth of the seams,

54
00:03:08.790 --> 00:03:12.640
virtually all the blocks that make up this astounding stone complex are like

55
00:03:12.641 --> 00:03:15.560
this. It's simply fascinating from a distance.

56
00:03:15.561 --> 00:03:18.080
You wouldn't think much of the methods used to cut these stones,

57
00:03:18.570 --> 00:03:21.750
but it's not until you get up close that you can appreciate the level a of

58
00:03:21.950 --> 00:03:24.070
accuracy. It truly is next level,

59
00:03:24.650 --> 00:03:27.710
but you should know that this is not some one off fluke example.

60
00:03:27.970 --> 00:03:31.950
As there are counts, others found throughout the land of ancient agent,

61
00:03:32.740 --> 00:03:37.470
even the ground itself has been lined with such unbelievably precise stone

62
00:03:37.471 --> 00:03:41.380
blocks that without careful inspection, you might not notice at all.

63
00:03:41.400 --> 00:03:44.660
And like I just said, stone cuts that are so fine.

64
00:03:44.661 --> 00:03:48.900
That it's difficult for even cameras to pick up on, just compare this line,

65
00:03:48.901 --> 00:03:52.180
cut to a hotel room key, which is of course the size of a credit card.

66
00:03:52.880 --> 00:03:56.820
The exactness of these two blocks that are pieced together makes the width of

67
00:03:56.821 --> 00:04:00.690
that card look thick in comparison, because again,

68
00:04:00.710 --> 00:04:05.170
notice how you can hardly see that line from even just a few feet above it.

69
00:04:05.830 --> 00:04:10.050
And you'll be curious to know that this example here is only a few steps away

70
00:04:10.051 --> 00:04:12.570
from the great pyramid of Giza. In fact, it's right next to it.

71
00:04:13.110 --> 00:04:16.570
You see something that most people are not aware of is that the entire ground

72
00:04:16.850 --> 00:04:20.840
surrounding the pyramids are covered in flooring stones and there thousands of

73
00:04:20.841 --> 00:04:23.240
them, many of which are polygonal in shape,

74
00:04:23.460 --> 00:04:27.440
cut and piece together perfectly again, as if a puzzle you see,

75
00:04:27.460 --> 00:04:31.400
it becomes even more interesting when you realize that these stones have been

76
00:04:31.401 --> 00:04:36.320
there for at least 4,500 years beneath

77
00:04:36.321 --> 00:04:39.800
the blaring sun and elements of erosion, including wind rain, weather,

78
00:04:39.940 --> 00:04:44.790
and of core millions of humans that have walked on stumbled and further

79
00:04:44.791 --> 00:04:47.630
deteriorated. These blocks in the thousands of years since,

80
00:04:48.410 --> 00:04:52.390
and examples of polygonal flooring stones can be found at various temples

81
00:04:52.391 --> 00:04:54.950
throughout Egypt, even in the most unlikely places,

82
00:04:55.100 --> 00:04:59.670
such as the roof of the temple of hot tour in Dendera hundreds of

83
00:04:59.740 --> 00:05:04.300
polygonal stones, which although weathered and eroded upon a closer inspection,

84
00:05:04.360 --> 00:05:07.220
you can see just how precise these stone cuts are,

85
00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:12.060
but getting back to the even more impressive stuff, wait until you see this,

86
00:05:12.960 --> 00:05:16.580
the so-called bent pyramid of Egypt is a place that very,

87
00:05:16.930 --> 00:05:19.380
very few people have seen with their own eyes.

88
00:05:19.560 --> 00:05:23.410
As it's been close to the public and even archeologists for several decades,

89
00:05:24.320 --> 00:05:28.290
even the most notable researchers have been denied access to enter inside this

90
00:05:28.291 --> 00:05:32.570
pyramid. That is until it finally opened in the summer of 2019.

91
00:05:32.670 --> 00:05:37.450
And I had the great timing and privilege to me among the very first tourists to

92
00:05:37.451 --> 00:05:41.050
enter this utterly bizarre structure in December of 2020.

93
00:05:41.190 --> 00:05:42.640
And I filmed the higher thing.

94
00:05:42.660 --> 00:05:46.920
And if you're interested in seeing the incredibly bizarre interior structure and

95
00:05:46.921 --> 00:05:47.754
layout of this pyramid,

96
00:05:48.060 --> 00:05:50.560
you'll wanna check up my video tour of it after this video.

97
00:05:50.820 --> 00:05:54.160
But when you enter inside and traverse the tunnels of cut limestone,

98
00:05:54.161 --> 00:05:56.880
that makes up the structure, you see precision cuts,

99
00:05:57.140 --> 00:06:00.520
the likes of which are nothing short of astounding.

100
00:06:01.190 --> 00:06:04.280
Look at that. Like I mentioned earlier,

101
00:06:04.510 --> 00:06:07.680
many of these cuts are so exact that it's difficult for the camera to

102
00:06:07.681 --> 00:06:09.000
differentiate the blocks together.

103
00:06:09.590 --> 00:06:12.200
Even notice this example of three stone blocks joined,

104
00:06:13.020 --> 00:06:16.790
ignore the damage and imperfect exterior portions of the block,

105
00:06:16.791 --> 00:06:20.950
which naturally catch your eye and focus on the line, cuts themselves.

106
00:06:21.620 --> 00:06:25.910
Whoever built this clearly chose to make the fitting of the blocks to a level of

107
00:06:25.911 --> 00:06:30.030
perfection while focusing less on the exterior portion of blocks that make up

108
00:06:30.031 --> 00:06:30.950
the pyramid tunnels.

109
00:06:31.490 --> 00:06:34.430
And you'll notice that this is the case from Florida ceiling throughout this

110
00:06:34.431 --> 00:06:38.820
pyramid. And these blocks are by no means small yet.

111
00:06:38.840 --> 00:06:43.620
Cut so perfectly that the align so tightly that not even a razor or human hair

112
00:06:43.621 --> 00:06:44.740
could fit in between them,

113
00:06:45.560 --> 00:06:50.340
I'd even venture to say that they're probably watertight as well and do not be

114
00:06:50.341 --> 00:06:52.860
fooled by their soft chalk like appearance.

115
00:06:53.320 --> 00:06:56.620
You could push your fingernail into this stone as hard as you possibly could,

116
00:06:56.680 --> 00:06:59.530
and it wouldn't even scratch it. As the saying goes,

117
00:06:59.680 --> 00:07:03.050
they are as hard as a rock in examples like this,

118
00:07:03.140 --> 00:07:05.810
where we see the intersection of three stone blocks,

119
00:07:05.860 --> 00:07:10.770
connecting at such a fine degree of accuracy provides us with a wonderful

120
00:07:10.771 --> 00:07:11.520
perspective.

121
00:07:11.520 --> 00:07:15.850
That illustrates just how remarkable the capabilities were for the people that

122
00:07:15.851 --> 00:07:17.890
made this. But that's the thing.

123
00:07:18.340 --> 00:07:20.480
And this is where things start to get really weird.

124
00:07:20.980 --> 00:07:23.240
So before I show you more astonishing photos,

125
00:07:23.790 --> 00:07:25.520
there's something you need to know.

126
00:07:25.700 --> 00:07:29.120
And most people are completely surprised at what I'm going to share next,

127
00:07:29.121 --> 00:07:33.320
because it shows just how truly mysterious the ancient Egyptians are.

128
00:07:33.660 --> 00:07:37.040
You see these bronze chisels here. And just so you know,

129
00:07:37.041 --> 00:07:39.510
bronze is a combination of copper and 10,

130
00:07:39.650 --> 00:07:42.990
but you see these other various bronze tools here as well,

131
00:07:42.991 --> 00:07:45.030
including small handheld saws.

132
00:07:45.090 --> 00:07:48.550
And here are a few more examples of various Egyptian tooling,

133
00:07:48.551 --> 00:07:52.190
all of which are on display in the chiro museum, Egypt. I took these photos,

134
00:07:52.330 --> 00:07:53.163
myself.

135
00:07:53.650 --> 00:07:58.470
All of these tools you're seeing are literally the only examples

136
00:07:58.570 --> 00:08:03.460
of the types of known tools utilized by the ancient Egyptians that have ever

137
00:08:03.810 --> 00:08:05.700
been found. Just to clarify,

138
00:08:05.870 --> 00:08:08.740
these are not the only number of chisels or saws ever found,

139
00:08:08.800 --> 00:08:13.660
but they are the only types of tooling ever found to exist from the ancient

140
00:08:13.970 --> 00:08:17.380
Egyptians. That's right. And here's something else you need to know,

141
00:08:17.600 --> 00:08:19.500
is that out of the hundreds of thousands of,

142
00:08:19.570 --> 00:08:22.290
of hieroglyphics found throughout the land of ancient Egypt,

143
00:08:22.910 --> 00:08:27.850
not one single one of them shows anything about how the Egyptians cutter carved

144
00:08:28.130 --> 00:08:32.290
stone or constructed the pyramids, literally zero whatsoever.

145
00:08:32.470 --> 00:08:34.290
And that's a verifiable fact, by the way,

146
00:08:34.520 --> 00:08:37.570
it's just that most people are completely surprised when they hear that for the

147
00:08:37.571 --> 00:08:42.080
first time you see what happened is we were sewn animations like these as

148
00:08:42.240 --> 00:08:43.073
children in school,

149
00:08:43.260 --> 00:08:47.880
not realizing that this is nothing more than some theorized drawing created only

150
00:08:48.120 --> 00:08:52.040
recently for school textbooks, a bunch of primitive dudes wearing nothing,

151
00:08:52.180 --> 00:08:57.040
but loing cloths using soft bronze chisels to shape the stones that make up

152
00:08:57.060 --> 00:08:58.400
the pyramids of Egypt.

153
00:08:59.060 --> 00:09:02.440
But here is the reality of what happened when people actually tested these

154
00:09:02.880 --> 00:09:04.760
primitive alleged methods. In modern times.

155
00:09:05.610 --> 00:09:07.040
<v 1>After days of work,</v>

156
00:09:07.290 --> 00:09:11.160
their copper chisels and stone pounders are barely making a dent.

157
00:09:14.520 --> 00:09:17.790
Brown is wearing down tools at an extraordinary rate.

158
00:09:20.210 --> 00:09:21.190
The copper chisel,

159
00:09:21.191 --> 00:09:25.550
the ancient Egyptians would've used last only a few dozen strikes.

160
00:09:27.340 --> 00:09:29.430
<v 0>That was a notable Egyptologist testing,</v>

161
00:09:29.800 --> 00:09:33.670
stone hammers and bronze chisels on limestone in an attempt to recreate the

162
00:09:34.190 --> 00:09:34.610
sink's nose.

163
00:09:34.610 --> 00:09:38.980
And you heard what they said after a few days of work and they barely made a

164
00:09:38.981 --> 00:09:43.620
dent and the chisels themselves after just a few dozen strikes were worn out and

165
00:09:43.621 --> 00:09:47.700
useless. So clearly not a feasible explanation. And,

166
00:09:47.701 --> 00:09:49.820
and what you didn't see is that later in this documentary,

167
00:09:50.010 --> 00:09:53.740
they completely gave up and resorted to using power saws to finish the task.

168
00:09:54.520 --> 00:09:56.810
But that was bronze to chisels on limestone.

169
00:09:57.000 --> 00:09:59.530
Wait until you see what happened when he tried it on granite.

170
00:09:59.920 --> 00:10:04.130
<v 2>When Roger tries chiseled made from bros, the results are disappointing.</v>

171
00:10:08.150 --> 00:10:08.983
<v 3>As you can see,</v>

172
00:10:09.580 --> 00:10:14.410
we're just leaving a lot of metal and very little stone is flaky. Ah.

173
00:10:19.150 --> 00:10:20.200
<v 0>Yeah. So no,</v>

174
00:10:20.470 --> 00:10:24.560
obviously bronze chisels were not the methods of tools utilized by the Egyptians

175
00:10:24.800 --> 00:10:27.800
or, or anyone to cut and carve stone of any kind,

176
00:10:28.450 --> 00:10:32.600
which is why it is so bizarre to see that this is still a primary

177
00:10:32.790 --> 00:10:34.400
explanation that is taught today.

178
00:10:34.870 --> 00:10:38.030
They even have it posted as this descriptions within museums.

179
00:10:38.210 --> 00:10:42.390
And the reason for this is because the people writing ancient history books in

180
00:10:42.391 --> 00:10:46.750
modern times have concluded that these must be the types of tools that were used

181
00:10:47.200 --> 00:10:50.070
since they are the only types of tools that have ever been found.

182
00:10:50.210 --> 00:10:52.350
So case closed mystery solved,

183
00:10:52.450 --> 00:10:56.950
but they proclaim that without ever having tested these primitive alleged method

184
00:10:57.110 --> 00:10:59.980
themselves and bronze chisels aside,

185
00:11:00.040 --> 00:11:03.660
the more commonly accepted explanation for cutting the granite and limestone

186
00:11:03.661 --> 00:11:07.220
blocks involves copper saws. But again,

187
00:11:07.390 --> 00:11:11.980
these are the only examples of saws ever found from the ancient Egyptians.

188
00:11:12.120 --> 00:11:13.140
And not only that,

189
00:11:13.680 --> 00:11:18.130
the only depictions of the Egyptians using saws of any kind are the these right

190
00:11:18.131 --> 00:11:22.850
here, which clearly shows them using small saws to cut wood for constructing

191
00:11:23.040 --> 00:11:23.873
furniture.

192
00:11:24.190 --> 00:11:28.890
So watch what happens with that same Egyptologist mark Laneer used a copper saw

193
00:11:29.070 --> 00:11:32.170
to demonstrate how it could have been used to cut granite blocks.

194
00:11:33.450 --> 00:11:35.130
<v 5>All right, we have a big block of granite here.</v>

195
00:11:35.350 --> 00:11:37.930
So how's this copper gonna cut this granite.

196
00:11:38.080 --> 00:11:41.200
<v 2>Even with teeth, the copper alone is too soft.</v>

197
00:11:41.730 --> 00:11:46.280
<v 6>We're going to put sand inside the groove and we're going to put this so on top</v>

198
00:11:46.281 --> 00:11:49.000
of the sand and then let the sand do the cutting.

199
00:11:51.740 --> 00:11:56.040
<v 5>Now, Dennis, will we see any progress in our lifetime? Yes. Um,</v>

200
00:11:56.500 --> 00:11:58.240
if you came back in an hour's time,

201
00:11:58.340 --> 00:12:02.520
you would see about a four millimeter crop down into the stone. You're kidding.

202
00:12:02.580 --> 00:12:05.160
In an hour, you'll be four millimeters down. Well,

203
00:12:05.230 --> 00:12:09.240
I've been doing a lot of experiments and I can guarantee that this will cook

204
00:12:09.520 --> 00:12:12.120
through the stone. That's about four millimeters an hour.

205
00:12:16.870 --> 00:12:20.070
<v 3>The sign went wonderful. Once we switched over to using, uh,</v>

206
00:12:20.071 --> 00:12:22.990
water with the sand. As you can see here,

207
00:12:23.330 --> 00:12:25.230
we achieved this in just a few days.

208
00:12:27.460 --> 00:12:31.750
<v 0>Four millimeters an hour, and in just a few inches over a few days,</v>

209
00:12:32.130 --> 00:12:32.963
are you kidding me?

210
00:12:33.480 --> 00:12:37.900
So besides the fact that no saw of this size was ever found nor was there any

211
00:12:37.960 --> 00:12:41.460
saw of this size ever found to be depicted by the Egyptians,

212
00:12:42.320 --> 00:12:47.260
but we can clearly see that this method is so unbelievably so or slow that it

213
00:12:47.261 --> 00:12:51.820
could possibly be a feasible explanation for how the Egyptians cut and carve the

214
00:12:51.821 --> 00:12:54.370
millions of stones that make a up the pyramids,

215
00:12:54.371 --> 00:12:58.450
because keep in mind that the great pyramid of Giza is made of some

216
00:12:58.630 --> 00:13:03.050
2.3 million stone blocks and was said to be constructed over

217
00:13:03.051 --> 00:13:07.250
approximately 20 years. That means that they would've had to cut, carve,

218
00:13:07.251 --> 00:13:08.084
move in place,

219
00:13:08.350 --> 00:13:11.970
at least one stone block every few minutes to achieve that timeline.

220
00:13:12.790 --> 00:13:17.040
And this does not include the many millions of more stone blocks that make up

221
00:13:17.041 --> 00:13:20.000
more than a hundred other known pyramids found throughout Egypt.

222
00:13:20.470 --> 00:13:23.480
Many people are not aware of just how many Egyptian pyramids there are.

223
00:13:24.140 --> 00:13:28.400
And all of which were said to be done within a very specific timeline for their

224
00:13:28.401 --> 00:13:29.400
respective Pharaoh,

225
00:13:29.500 --> 00:13:33.360
at least according to alleged story that we've been taught in modern times.

226
00:13:34.020 --> 00:13:38.950
And I wonder are just how many millions of blocks would make up that 118

227
00:13:38.990 --> 00:13:42.430
pyramids, because of course they're all of differing sizes and dimensions,

228
00:13:43.170 --> 00:13:46.830
and this does not include the many millions of stone blocks that make up the

229
00:13:46.970 --> 00:13:50.670
dozens of various temples found throughout Egypt. This is just a few examples,

230
00:13:51.330 --> 00:13:53.950
all of which were made from countless stack blocks,

231
00:13:54.770 --> 00:13:58.700
nor does it include the countless flooring stones that surround these temples

232
00:13:59.000 --> 00:14:00.660
and the pyramids of Giza itself,

233
00:14:01.400 --> 00:14:05.500
nor does it include the hundreds of various structures, including betas,

234
00:14:05.960 --> 00:14:07.540
all of which are made of stone blocks,

235
00:14:08.240 --> 00:14:12.380
nor does it include the countless stones that make up the many columns founded

236
00:14:12.480 --> 00:14:14.020
dozens of sites throughout Egypt,

237
00:14:14.760 --> 00:14:19.250
nor does it include the many gigantic stone OS giant

238
00:14:19.460 --> 00:14:20.293
stone boxes,

239
00:14:20.350 --> 00:14:24.490
as well as the countless stone SAR kava guy found all over the place far more

240
00:14:24.730 --> 00:14:26.370
that could possibly be shared in this video.

241
00:14:27.190 --> 00:14:31.370
And nor does it include the thousands of incredible stone statues that have been

242
00:14:31.371 --> 00:14:32.890
found throughout the land of ancient Egypt.

243
00:14:33.510 --> 00:14:36.640
And it sure doesn't include all of the, uh, the random,

244
00:14:37.360 --> 00:14:41.040
incredibly shaped granite stones that are once part of structures that are long

245
00:14:41.041 --> 00:14:43.600
since gone impeccably, curved, granite,

246
00:14:43.601 --> 00:14:47.520
that couldn't possibly be done with the known tooling found in Egypt is at least

247
00:14:47.620 --> 00:14:48.800
as far as what you've just seen,

248
00:14:48.900 --> 00:14:52.640
and you don't have to be a stone Mason archeologist,

249
00:14:52.860 --> 00:14:57.240
or even a fricking rock and scientist to comprehend that these tools here copper

250
00:14:57.390 --> 00:15:02.000
saws and chisels did not create the cuts of this level of precision.

251
00:15:02.420 --> 00:15:06.480
And this certainly does not even address the size of these stones and the time

252
00:15:06.640 --> 00:15:08.640
it would take to do it, which is of course,

253
00:15:08.920 --> 00:15:11.070
a major factor that must be considered.

254
00:15:11.610 --> 00:15:15.630
But there's even more proof that these blocks were not cut with two guys holding

255
00:15:15.830 --> 00:15:20.470
onto some handheld saw this granite sarcophagus is one of many

256
00:15:20.580 --> 00:15:24.030
that are on display and the chiro museum in Egypt. However,

257
00:15:24.060 --> 00:15:27.550
what makes this particular stone box so unique is that it's listed as being

258
00:15:27.551 --> 00:15:30.230
discarded by the Egyptians. As on the other side,

259
00:15:30.231 --> 00:15:33.380
you see that they may made a mistake and the cut and it went off center.

260
00:15:34.200 --> 00:15:38.060
But this in itself is evidence that the Egyptians were not using some

261
00:15:38.660 --> 00:15:42.620
unbelievably slow primitive handheld saw, because if that was the case,

262
00:15:43.130 --> 00:15:46.260
they would've noticed and corrected their mistake almost immediately.

263
00:15:46.800 --> 00:15:50.660
The fact that it continued off center from nearly another three feet strongly

264
00:15:51.140 --> 00:15:55.130
indicate that they were using a method that was far quicker and superior.

265
00:15:55.910 --> 00:15:59.690
The evidence is right in front of us. Like I always say,

266
00:15:59.760 --> 00:16:01.370
look and think for yourself,

267
00:16:01.820 --> 00:16:05.050
there are far too many details that weren't shown to us when we learned about

268
00:16:05.051 --> 00:16:06.210
the Egyptians as kids.

269
00:16:06.790 --> 00:16:11.250
But when you revisit this amazing topic as an adult with more life experience

270
00:16:11.251 --> 00:16:12.920
and the ability to use discernment,

271
00:16:13.420 --> 00:16:16.840
you can see just how real the mystery is yet.

272
00:16:16.910 --> 00:16:19.240
Despite all the details I shared in this video,

273
00:16:19.550 --> 00:16:22.640
many will still adamantly defend these debunked narratives.

274
00:16:23.020 --> 00:16:26.400
But you have to keep in mind that many of these people that propose these

275
00:16:26.401 --> 00:16:30.120
alleged methods have never actually been to each of themselves and nor have they

276
00:16:30.121 --> 00:16:33.590
physically tried to cut stone block with these primitive methods either.

277
00:16:34.090 --> 00:16:36.350
And those who have attempted it have given up,

278
00:16:36.351 --> 00:16:38.070
they've never finished one single block.

279
00:16:38.500 --> 00:16:40.630
They do it for a little bit and realize like, oh, wow,

280
00:16:40.631 --> 00:16:43.750
this is extremely difficult. And just stop right there. I mean,

281
00:16:43.760 --> 00:16:47.950
isn't that interesting because between all the stone cut blocks that make up the

282
00:16:47.951 --> 00:16:52.630
hundreds of pyramids, temples, various stone structures, flooring stones,

283
00:16:53.330 --> 00:16:57.340
columns, OS statues, stone boxes,

284
00:16:57.580 --> 00:16:58.980
and Sarco guy and everything else.

285
00:16:59.820 --> 00:17:04.100
I wouldn't be surprised if the Egyptians cut at least 50 million stone blocks,

286
00:17:04.510 --> 00:17:07.980
maybe even closer to a hundred million perhaps. I mean, who knows yet,

287
00:17:07.981 --> 00:17:12.620
you will not find one single example in modern times of a

288
00:17:12.750 --> 00:17:16.930
fully cut stone block that was done with these primitive methods.

289
00:17:17.660 --> 00:17:18.650
Isn't that interesting?

290
00:17:19.110 --> 00:17:21.690
You have the Egyptians with tens of millions of stone blocks,

291
00:17:21.700 --> 00:17:23.930
maybe even a hundred million. I'm just throwing out a number here,

292
00:17:23.950 --> 00:17:28.530
but tens of millions, no doubt. And yet we haven't done one in modern times.

293
00:17:29.440 --> 00:17:33.650
It's clear that the ancient Egyptians had some sort of lost technology

294
00:17:34.420 --> 00:17:35.253
by technology.

295
00:17:35.820 --> 00:17:39.640
We shouldn't just think computers and lasers and anything else in our mind that

296
00:17:39.641 --> 00:17:42.560
technology itself can be something quite simple. I mean,

297
00:17:42.590 --> 00:17:46.520
even a saddle on a horse is considered a technology.

298
00:17:47.180 --> 00:17:50.520
We have to think out the box outside the box and it doesn't have to involve

299
00:17:50.660 --> 00:17:54.000
aliens, cuz that's usually what people say when they argue against these,

300
00:17:54.050 --> 00:17:57.440
these methods say, oh, so let me guess you think it was aliens, right?

301
00:17:57.590 --> 00:18:01.280
It's like, what's that about? Like, I'm not suggesting aliens.

302
00:18:01.400 --> 00:18:04.320
And very few people that are discussing these methods have said aliens.

303
00:18:04.910 --> 00:18:08.440
It's just that you need to look at this with open eyes and see that the mystery

304
00:18:08.610 --> 00:18:10.750
is here. When you see this stuff as an adult,

305
00:18:10.850 --> 00:18:14.950
you can see just how real the mystery is, but I'm gonna wrap it up here.

306
00:18:14.970 --> 00:18:19.710
My next video will be out very, very soon. And if you wanna see more amazing VO,

307
00:18:19.990 --> 00:18:22.470
uh, pictures of these stones go to my Instagram,

308
00:18:22.471 --> 00:18:26.550
I'll leave it link down in the description and I'll leave it a link for my

309
00:18:27.350 --> 00:18:30.140
TikTok. I created an accounts. Haven't put a video up yet,

310
00:18:30.520 --> 00:18:34.220
but I have to now branch out in order to bring more people to this channel.

311
00:18:34.440 --> 00:18:37.340
And I, I didn't wanna get on TikTok, but now I realize that that,

312
00:18:37.490 --> 00:18:41.140
that platform's just too big and it's not going away. So if you're interested,

313
00:18:41.500 --> 00:18:44.500
go on there because I'm gonna be making a whole bunch of videos in a short

314
00:18:44.501 --> 00:18:47.580
period of time to launch that thing. But anyways, I'll leave it at that.

315
00:18:47.920 --> 00:18:51.690
My name's Jimmy, my channel's called brighten insight. Take care of everybody.
