1
00:00:00.510 --> 00:00:02.760
<v 0>Okay. So the evidence is overwhelmingly conclusive.</v>

2
00:00:02.970 --> 00:00:07.040
There was absolutely a massive global cataly that happened approximately

3
00:00:09.120 --> 00:00:12.960
12,980 years ago. That was a total reset button for human civilization.

4
00:00:13.460 --> 00:00:16.080
In this video, I'm gonna show you five key pieces of evidence,

5
00:00:16.081 --> 00:00:20.790
including core eye sample data taken from both Antarctica and green land

6
00:00:21.700 --> 00:00:24.510
soil data taken from the younger dries black mat layer.

7
00:00:25.250 --> 00:00:30.230
<v 1>The unexplainable extinction event of 75% of all mammals in north America and</v>

8
00:00:30.270 --> 00:00:35.230
120 large megafauna I E mammals larger than 100 pounds that all went

9
00:00:35.231 --> 00:00:36.470
extinct at the same period of time.

10
00:00:37.430 --> 00:00:40.790
Evidence of the sudden and unexplainable end of the last ice age,

11
00:00:41.580 --> 00:00:43.740
a massive 400 foot rise in sea level.

12
00:00:43.741 --> 00:00:45.780
That happened in a very short period of time,

13
00:00:46.280 --> 00:00:49.820
as well as a key piece of evidence that proves that there was an advanced human

14
00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:53.900
civilization dating back more than 13,000 years yet,

15
00:00:53.901 --> 00:00:57.740
despite the overwhelming evidence taken from the most recent and technologically

16
00:00:57.741 --> 00:01:00.580
advanced scientific analysis ever taken on this subject,

17
00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:02.530
it's still not being taught in schools.

18
00:01:02.880 --> 00:01:04.490
<v 0>It's still not printed in the textbooks.</v>

19
00:01:04.750 --> 00:01:08.410
And you still won't hear about it from almost anyone in mainstream science.

20
00:01:08.990 --> 00:01:12.010
Now let's start with key evidence from the core eye samples taken from

21
00:01:12.011 --> 00:01:13.770
Antarctica and Greenland.

22
00:01:14.120 --> 00:01:17.330
Both these samples confirm that there was two events,

23
00:01:17.470 --> 00:01:22.400
one that happened 12,980 years ago give or take five years as well

24
00:01:22.401 --> 00:01:26.720
as another one that happened 1400 years later, or 11,600 years ago,

25
00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:31.320
where we saw a few things happen on planet earth in a very short period of time,

26
00:01:31.670 --> 00:01:34.200
including a 400 foot rise in sea level,

27
00:01:34.490 --> 00:01:38.080
which happened so rapidly that there's evidence that suggests that it may have

28
00:01:38.081 --> 00:01:42.000
raised as much as 30 feet globally in just a 24 hour period,

29
00:01:42.770 --> 00:01:46.470
as well as a 15 degree Fahrenheit temperature swing that went from one end of

30
00:01:46.471 --> 00:01:48.390
the spectrum to the other in that period of time.

31
00:01:48.940 --> 00:01:52.990
Most of which happened in just a few cycles of seasons I E a couple years,

32
00:01:53.770 --> 00:01:56.550
you know, it's interesting with all this talk about global warming right now,

33
00:01:56.990 --> 00:01:59.950
everyone's fussing over what the effects will be of a three degree Fahrenheit

34
00:01:59.951 --> 00:02:03.420
temperature increase. Guys, we're talking about five to times,

35
00:02:03.480 --> 00:02:06.940
as much as that now the process for getting this data from the core eye samples

36
00:02:06.941 --> 00:02:07.860
is very interesting.

37
00:02:08.080 --> 00:02:11.980
You can literally see and measure the rise and fall of sea levels from one year

38
00:02:11.981 --> 00:02:14.740
to the next. So you're probably asking what could have caused such an event.

39
00:02:15.050 --> 00:02:17.500
Well, the evidence is overwhelming that there was a cosmic collision.

40
00:02:18.180 --> 00:02:21.060
I E a comment or an asteroid hit the north American ice shelf,

41
00:02:21.061 --> 00:02:24.450
which at that time was more than two kilometers thick on average,

42
00:02:24.590 --> 00:02:26.050
that's more than a mile thick guys.

43
00:02:26.230 --> 00:02:28.170
And in some places more than two miles thick,

44
00:02:28.680 --> 00:02:33.370
this cosmic impact would've caused a massive evaporation of a significant

45
00:02:33.371 --> 00:02:35.970
portion of the north American ice shelf. Not all of it,

46
00:02:36.350 --> 00:02:38.250
but enough of it to cause massive flooding,

47
00:02:38.590 --> 00:02:42.850
as well as having a significant portion of this ice blasted into the atmosphere

48
00:02:43.080 --> 00:02:47.880
only to be rained down in significant proportions around the globe for days

49
00:02:47.940 --> 00:02:49.160
and weeks to come. Now,

50
00:02:49.161 --> 00:02:52.800
further evidence that supports this cosmic impact includes the younger dries

51
00:02:53.010 --> 00:02:55.920
black mat boundary that you can see in these pictures here.

52
00:02:56.020 --> 00:02:59.120
And there have been samples taken from dozens of locations across three

53
00:02:59.200 --> 00:03:03.080
continents around the world that shows that more than 50 million kilometers,

54
00:03:03.100 --> 00:03:07.440
almost a third of the Earth's land mass was literally covered in two to three

55
00:03:07.680 --> 00:03:11.720
inches of nano diamonds, melt glass Iridium,

56
00:03:12.190 --> 00:03:14.120
even extraterrestrial helium.

57
00:03:14.940 --> 00:03:19.350
Now these elements are only found from two causes nuclear glass in cosmic

58
00:03:19.351 --> 00:03:23.110
collisions. However, when you take into account the extraterrestrial helium,

59
00:03:23.111 --> 00:03:26.950
as it's called, it's pretty conclusive that it was in fact, a cosmic collision.

60
00:03:27.290 --> 00:03:30.430
Now at that same exact period of time, as we're seeing in the soil samples,

61
00:03:30.540 --> 00:03:33.390
there's an unexplainable mass die off. Like I said,

62
00:03:33.391 --> 00:03:38.270
75% of all mammals in north America went extinct in a very short period of time,

63
00:03:38.730 --> 00:03:43.300
as well as 120 megafauna or BAMS that are larger than a hundred pounds.

64
00:03:43.570 --> 00:03:46.020
Many of which, I mean, look at these pictures, some of these you have never,

65
00:03:46.021 --> 00:03:47.940
ever seen before, you never knew they existed.

66
00:03:47.941 --> 00:03:50.580
They're not covered in the textbooks. Largely. However,

67
00:03:50.720 --> 00:03:53.020
the current explanation by modern science is that, well,

68
00:03:53.300 --> 00:03:56.700
apparently humans must have caused the mass extinction that a punch of primitive

69
00:03:56.701 --> 00:03:59.380
hunters and gatherers overkilled and over hunted.

70
00:03:59.810 --> 00:04:01.890
And that's why there was this mass die off. However,

71
00:04:01.960 --> 00:04:04.450
this evidence that contradicts that, for example,

72
00:04:04.660 --> 00:04:08.410
there has been mass mortality sites of Willie Mamo.

73
00:04:08.680 --> 00:04:11.770
They have found fields of more than 1000 Willie Mamo,

74
00:04:12.120 --> 00:04:15.930
many of which had broken legs as if their body had been blasted over with their

75
00:04:15.931 --> 00:04:19.090
legs, still standing. And some of which still have food in their mouth.

76
00:04:19.680 --> 00:04:23.640
This further validates that there was a sudden and cosmic collision that caused

77
00:04:23.680 --> 00:04:26.800
a mass extinction event for so many animals in a short period of time.

78
00:04:27.260 --> 00:04:29.280
So if this was possible for the dinosaurs,

79
00:04:29.540 --> 00:04:32.320
why wouldn't we think that it's possible to have happened to humans,

80
00:04:32.321 --> 00:04:36.680
which we know were alive at that time? Take for example, go Beckley Tepe. Now,

81
00:04:36.681 --> 00:04:39.120
most people aren't aware of this, it's located in Turkey,

82
00:04:39.260 --> 00:04:40.440
not far from Mesopotamia,

83
00:04:41.010 --> 00:04:45.990
and it is dated at least to be 11,600 years ago through analyzation

84
00:04:46.090 --> 00:04:50.990
of organic matter pottery and other elements and artifacts found at that site

85
00:04:51.250 --> 00:04:53.030
11,600 years ago.

86
00:04:53.530 --> 00:04:58.030
Now this site is more than 7,000 years older than Stonehenge,

87
00:04:58.031 --> 00:05:00.510
which is largely mysterious in of itself, right?

88
00:05:01.640 --> 00:05:03.340
Not only is it 7,000 years older,

89
00:05:03.810 --> 00:05:08.340
it's more than 50 times bigger as verified through ground penetrating radar and

90
00:05:08.341 --> 00:05:10.220
only 5% of it has been excavated.

91
00:05:10.360 --> 00:05:12.260
Now what's particularly interesting about this site.

92
00:05:12.270 --> 00:05:15.700
Isn't just the fact that it's the world's oldest and largest megalithic

93
00:05:15.860 --> 00:05:20.500
structure, but the fact that it's the first building or structure to ever align

94
00:05:20.810 --> 00:05:24.890
perfectly north and south, not just in the direction of north and south,

95
00:05:25.390 --> 00:05:27.170
but perfect. Now, first of all,

96
00:05:27.171 --> 00:05:31.250
that's obviously not an accident when you consider just how incredible this site

97
00:05:31.270 --> 00:05:36.010
is that there's 20 to 50 ton pillars that clearly have a celestial

98
00:05:36.160 --> 00:05:37.850
meaning to them. However,

99
00:05:37.990 --> 00:05:41.570
one of the key pieces of information about go Beckley Tepe is that you could not

100
00:05:41.890 --> 00:05:46.680
PO construct a perfectly north south facing structure without having advanced

101
00:05:46.960 --> 00:05:51.440
astronomical knowledge. So how were they able to have that 11,600 years ago?

102
00:05:51.890 --> 00:05:54.000
After all, according to our textbooks,

103
00:05:54.060 --> 00:05:58.000
the Sumerians that date back 7,000 years ago are the ones that started all of

104
00:05:58.001 --> 00:05:59.440
human civilization yet.

105
00:05:59.441 --> 00:06:03.120
This exceeds that by thousands of years and it's completely unexplainable.

106
00:06:03.300 --> 00:06:03.921
And by the way,

107
00:06:03.921 --> 00:06:07.040
they also have evidence at the site of advanced agriculture that took place at

108
00:06:07.041 --> 00:06:08.280
that time. And like I said,

109
00:06:08.281 --> 00:06:12.200
advanced agriculture wasn't supposed to have started until the Sumerians more

110
00:06:12.201 --> 00:06:14.440
than 5,000 years later. That's interesting.

111
00:06:15.740 --> 00:06:19.470
Now here's a key piece of information you need to take into consideration right

112
00:06:19.490 --> 00:06:20.311
now, as of today,

113
00:06:20.311 --> 00:06:24.790
approximately 40% of the entire world's population lives right on the coast.

114
00:06:25.090 --> 00:06:29.470
And more than 75% of the world's population lives within 60 kilometers of a

115
00:06:29.471 --> 00:06:31.430
coast. And then when you take into consideration,

116
00:06:31.431 --> 00:06:35.430
the evidence that showed that there was a 400 foot rise in sea level, New York,

117
00:06:35.440 --> 00:06:40.180
Washington, DC, Los Angeles list, Tokyo, Beijing, London,

118
00:06:40.520 --> 00:06:42.900
so many other, I mean, I'll have to stop there cuz I could keep naming them.

119
00:06:43.160 --> 00:06:47.220
How many of the world's most advanced civilizations are right on the coast and

120
00:06:47.221 --> 00:06:50.300
what would happen if the sea levels rose as much as 30 feet overnight.

121
00:06:50.360 --> 00:06:51.193
Now that being said,

122
00:06:51.650 --> 00:06:54.140
this event wouldn't have made the entire human race go extinct.

123
00:06:54.141 --> 00:06:57.420
There would of course been survivors and that's where go Beckley Tepi.

124
00:06:58.330 --> 00:06:59.163
It suggests that this,

125
00:06:59.530 --> 00:07:02.530
that humanity was trying to rebuild itself after this massive cataly.

126
00:07:03.110 --> 00:07:07.810
And that it shows that 11,600 years ago was when this site essentially

127
00:07:08.130 --> 00:07:11.410
was stopped, operating was buried. And at that same exact period of time,

128
00:07:11.411 --> 00:07:14.850
there was another event that caused a massive rise and fall of global sea

129
00:07:14.851 --> 00:07:15.250
levels.

130
00:07:15.250 --> 00:07:19.320
Temperatures as well as a significant number of animals instinct all at that

131
00:07:19.321 --> 00:07:21.560
same period of time. I don't think that's a coincidence,

132
00:07:21.940 --> 00:07:25.040
but many people argue at okay, if there was an advanced civilization,

133
00:07:25.070 --> 00:07:27.880
where's all the evidence. Where's the metal buildings.

134
00:07:27.881 --> 00:07:30.440
Where's the fiber optic cables underground.

135
00:07:30.441 --> 00:07:34.320
Where's all this stuff we're talking over 10,000 years ago. I mean,

136
00:07:34.600 --> 00:07:35.401
take into consideration.

137
00:07:35.401 --> 00:07:38.480
What happens if you leave a car outside for just a few decades, searching,

138
00:07:38.550 --> 00:07:41.070
eating itself away or even houses. For example,

139
00:07:41.170 --> 00:07:44.390
if you don't do a significant restoration project on a house after a few

140
00:07:44.391 --> 00:07:46.350
decades, the house will fall in on itself.

141
00:07:46.850 --> 00:07:48.830
Now let's compare the Titanic as an example,

142
00:07:49.180 --> 00:07:53.710
more than 50,000 tons of steel and iron has been underwater for just more than a

143
00:07:53.711 --> 00:07:56.830
hundred years. And it's nearly all the way gone. And in another a hundred years,

144
00:07:56.831 --> 00:07:58.150
it'll almost be nonexistent.

145
00:07:58.770 --> 00:08:01.380
Now I'll think about what would happen over 10,000 years.

146
00:08:01.680 --> 00:08:03.900
The only thing that you would have left is stone. Now,

147
00:08:03.901 --> 00:08:07.580
something else that we find across the world across more than six continents in

148
00:08:07.581 --> 00:08:12.140
more than 500 cultures is the story of a flood. Well, look at these photos.

149
00:08:12.240 --> 00:08:16.260
Now these are from Joe Rogan's podcast with Randall Carlson and Graham Hancock.

150
00:08:16.600 --> 00:08:18.660
But what you're seeing here is photos from Montana,

151
00:08:18.830 --> 00:08:22.890
Idaho in Washington that showed these absolutely massive ripples,

152
00:08:22.960 --> 00:08:25.450
more than 50 feet tall and hundreds of feet long,

153
00:08:25.990 --> 00:08:30.770
and absolutely prove and show that there was some sort of massive flood that

154
00:08:30.930 --> 00:08:32.970
happened. In fact, take a look at this photo.

155
00:08:33.230 --> 00:08:38.050
It compares this location in Montana with Niagara falls. Now in Niagara falls,

156
00:08:38.051 --> 00:08:42.800
approximately 150,000 to 200,000 cubic feet of water spill over the falls.

157
00:08:43.010 --> 00:08:45.840
Every second. However, when you compare this size,

158
00:08:45.980 --> 00:08:50.680
it shows that this would've been more than 350 million cubic feet

159
00:08:50.780 --> 00:08:53.600
of water per second. Take for example, lake Tahoe,

160
00:08:53.601 --> 00:08:57.800
which is located between California and Nevada. This lake is 22 miles long,

161
00:08:57.820 --> 00:09:00.760
12 miles wide and up to 1600 feet deep.

162
00:09:00.980 --> 00:09:05.200
And there's enough water in this lake to cover the entire state of California in

163
00:09:05.440 --> 00:09:06.920
14 and a half inches of water.

164
00:09:07.340 --> 00:09:11.720
Now consider what would happen if you instantly evaporated or melted a,

165
00:09:11.721 --> 00:09:14.440
just a portion of the north American ice shelf. Like I mentioned,

166
00:09:14.710 --> 00:09:16.990
and earlier was more than two kilometers thick on average,

167
00:09:17.990 --> 00:09:20.430
want that explaining massive rise and sea level. At that time,

168
00:09:20.890 --> 00:09:22.830
we know that at the time of the last ice age,

169
00:09:22.970 --> 00:09:25.270
the sea level was 400 feet lower than it is today.

170
00:09:25.530 --> 00:09:29.070
So this explains a lot of megalithic structures that have been found off the

171
00:09:29.071 --> 00:09:30.830
coast of various regions around the world.

172
00:09:31.410 --> 00:09:33.830
So when you connect the dots in these key pieces of evidence,

173
00:09:33.831 --> 00:09:38.420
including the ice or samples, the younger driest boundary soil samples,

174
00:09:38.760 --> 00:09:42.020
the mass extinction, the rapid ending of the last ice age,

175
00:09:42.400 --> 00:09:47.380
the sudden rise of temperatures and the global sea level and go Beckley

176
00:09:47.780 --> 00:09:50.540
Tepe, which is completely unexplainable. Anyways, guys,

177
00:09:50.600 --> 00:09:52.020
I'm gonna close up there, leave a comment,

178
00:09:52.040 --> 00:09:54.980
let me know your thoughts and be sure to like and subscribe and help me spread

179
00:09:54.981 --> 00:09:56.810
