00:00:00.460 --> 00:00:05.200
<v 0>So the largest stone blocks ever cut the largest stone blocks ever moved the</v>

2
00:00:05.201 --> 00:00:10.160
largest stone blocks ever lifted as well as the largest solid stone columns

3
00:00:10.220 --> 00:00:15.080
in the history of ancient human civilization are all located in the same exact

4
00:00:15.320 --> 00:00:18.840
location, Eck Lebanon, and for some reason,

5
00:00:19.090 --> 00:00:24.030
mainstream historians and archeologists give 100% of the credit to the

6
00:00:24.130 --> 00:00:24.820
Romans.

7
00:00:24.820 --> 00:00:28.870
<v 2>Despite the fact that the Romans did not have the physical or technological</v>

8
00:00:29.200 --> 00:00:31.670
capability to move or lift these stones.

9
00:00:32.350 --> 00:00:36.390
Let me start off by showing you the three massive stone blocks located at the

10
00:00:36.391 --> 00:00:40.950
temple of Jupiter, also referred to as the tri Lathon or tri Lathon stones. The,

11
00:00:41.020 --> 00:00:45.660
these three stone blocks are 70 feet long, 14 feet high,

12
00:00:46.240 --> 00:00:47.500
and 10 feet wide,

13
00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:52.820
and were somehow lifted more than 30 feet off the ground what's even crazier

14
00:00:52.821 --> 00:00:56.820
is that they come from a quarry more than 800 meters or more than a half mile

15
00:00:56.890 --> 00:00:57.520
away.

16
00:00:57.520 --> 00:01:00.740
<v 0>And they were somehow brought uphill to this site.</v>

17
00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:04.770
When you take a look at these three stone blocks, look at the layer below them.

18
00:01:05.340 --> 00:01:09.970
These seven stone blocks are estimated to be 350 tons

19
00:01:10.330 --> 00:01:14.370
a piece, just compare these stone blocks to other people. As you can see here,

20
00:01:14.570 --> 00:01:15.251
standing next to them.

21
00:01:15.251 --> 00:01:18.930
So you can get an idea for just how massive these blocks are. Again,

22
00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:23.920
the largest blocks ever cut or moved or in the history of human

23
00:01:23.950 --> 00:01:27.280
existence are all at this site. And you can see 'em right here,

24
00:01:27.300 --> 00:01:30.280
but these aren't the only massive stone blocks at this site,

25
00:01:30.281 --> 00:01:33.040
which is also referred to as the Heliopolis, by the way,

26
00:01:33.860 --> 00:01:37.640
as you can see here between the temple of Bachus and the temple of Jupiter,

27
00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:41.880
you have this row of massive blocks, more than 800 tons,

28
00:01:42.160 --> 00:01:46.990
a piece estimated one of which is estimated to be between 900 and a

29
00:01:47.110 --> 00:01:49.590
thousand times. And you can see it right here next to the staircase,

30
00:01:50.170 --> 00:01:52.710
and just compare it again to people standing next to it.

31
00:01:52.711 --> 00:01:55.630
So you can get a feel for just how incredibly large these blocks are.

32
00:01:56.340 --> 00:01:58.670
Also take a look by the way, while I'm mentioning it,

33
00:01:59.010 --> 00:02:02.950
the temple of Baus and the foundation stones that it's built upon more,

34
00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:05.620
12 feet high, compare it next to people,

35
00:02:05.720 --> 00:02:08.540
and it's difficult to find good photos of this, but you get an idea.

36
00:02:09.040 --> 00:02:10.300
So the question becomes,

37
00:02:10.880 --> 00:02:15.780
how on earth were these stones moved a half mile uphill to this site?

38
00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:17.220
And how were they lifted?

39
00:02:17.480 --> 00:02:22.340
The mainstream idea or theory I should say is that they were moved on logs,

40
00:02:22.530 --> 00:02:26.330
literally that the put these things on top of logs and they had hundreds of

41
00:02:26.331 --> 00:02:29.290
people strapped to ropes and they dragged them uphill.

42
00:02:29.310 --> 00:02:33.490
But that of course just doesn't pass the common sense test. And by the way, you,

43
00:02:33.510 --> 00:02:36.930
it needs to be mentioned that none of these theories have ever been tested.

44
00:02:37.240 --> 00:02:39.810
They're simply just guessing. And it really doesn't make sense.

45
00:02:40.050 --> 00:02:42.690
Could you imagine being at the back of this thing where they have hundreds of

46
00:02:42.691 --> 00:02:47.240
people holding a tumor pound block to prevent it from sliding backwards as they

47
00:02:47.241 --> 00:02:48.920
go uphill? I mean, that's just ridiculous.

48
00:02:49.190 --> 00:02:53.600
Another theory is that they hooked up 800 S to ropes and to the stone to drag

49
00:02:53.601 --> 00:02:58.200
them to the current location, 800 S is based on how much weight one ox can pull,

50
00:02:58.580 --> 00:03:00.640
but there are so many things wrong with this. I mean,

51
00:03:00.641 --> 00:03:02.240
it doesn't pass the common sense test.

52
00:03:02.880 --> 00:03:06.320
Could you imagine what it would take to line up 800 S I mean,

53
00:03:06.321 --> 00:03:10.920
just to coordinate an a six or an eight horse hitch carriage is

54
00:03:11.200 --> 00:03:14.600
incredibly difficult. It requires an tremendous amount of coordination,

55
00:03:14.820 --> 00:03:18.710
but to do this with 800 S I mean, how they, how are they gonna pull that off?

56
00:03:18.730 --> 00:03:22.430
How long would it take to even hook these things up and not to mention the very

57
00:03:22.431 --> 00:03:23.750
nature of the stone itself?

58
00:03:23.810 --> 00:03:27.990
The shape of it would dig into the earth as it's being pulled and imagine the

59
00:03:27.991 --> 00:03:29.990
amount of weight that it'd be, you know, held up against.

60
00:03:30.090 --> 00:03:32.950
It just doesn't make any sense to put all this in perspective.

61
00:03:33.020 --> 00:03:36.270
What does it take to do in modern times to move a tremendous amount of weight?

62
00:03:36.980 --> 00:03:39.740
Well, let's look at the example back thousand 12,

63
00:03:39.760 --> 00:03:44.500
how the Los Angeles county museum of the arts moved a 340 ton

64
00:03:44.501 --> 00:03:47.780
stone block, more than a hundred miles and to do so,

65
00:03:48.170 --> 00:03:52.980
they had to custom build a truck that was 295 feet long

66
00:03:53.480 --> 00:03:56.460
and had get this 196 wheels.

67
00:03:56.920 --> 00:03:59.060
Now how they move these stone blocks in ancient times.

68
00:03:59.300 --> 00:04:01.450
And ball is the subject of much debate,

69
00:04:01.790 --> 00:04:05.330
but let's discuss what it would take to lift them because moving versus lifting

70
00:04:05.430 --> 00:04:06.810
are two totally different things.

71
00:04:07.190 --> 00:04:11.250
So the most powerful crane from Roman times is as you see here,

72
00:04:11.430 --> 00:04:14.250
and it could lift approximately 6,000 kilograms,

73
00:04:14.500 --> 00:04:19.450
which is equivalent to 6.6 tons. So wait a second.

74
00:04:20.500 --> 00:04:25.440
The strongest crane in the existence of the Roman empire can lift only 6.6 tons,

75
00:04:25.570 --> 00:04:28.520
which is impressive by the way, as it didn't have hydraulics,

76
00:04:28.740 --> 00:04:32.800
but let's go back to the tri Lathon stones at let's say 800 tons a piece.

77
00:04:32.870 --> 00:04:34.120
That means if you do the math,

78
00:04:34.121 --> 00:04:39.040
that would require 100 in 21 individual Roman cranes,

79
00:04:39.500 --> 00:04:42.870
or even let's just look at at the 350 Stu uh,

80
00:04:43.190 --> 00:04:48.030
ton stone blocks below that would require 53 individual cranes like that.

81
00:04:48.610 --> 00:04:50.630
That's in, that's ridiculous. You couldn't even,

82
00:04:50.631 --> 00:04:55.030
you don't even have enough space to move and surround one of these blocks with

83
00:04:55.031 --> 00:04:59.070
that many cranes. It doesn't make any sense. Does it now to again,

84
00:04:59.071 --> 00:05:02.380
give it an example from modern times, take a look at this crane here,

85
00:05:02.400 --> 00:05:04.180
you see cranes like this, driving down the freeway,

86
00:05:04.530 --> 00:05:09.420
they take up more than one lane E each one of these 12 tires is up to your neck.

87
00:05:09.820 --> 00:05:13.540
And, and this specific crane here has a max lift of 330 tons,

88
00:05:13.541 --> 00:05:15.540
which is incredible. Now,

89
00:05:15.740 --> 00:05:18.780
although this is not nearly the strongest crane in existence, by any means,

90
00:05:18.930 --> 00:05:22.090
it's just to paint you a picture here that when you see massive cranes like

91
00:05:22.091 --> 00:05:24.890
this, with the ability to lift a max of 330 tons,

92
00:05:25.430 --> 00:05:28.850
and we're supposed to believe that the Romans had some sort of primitive

93
00:05:28.851 --> 00:05:33.530
methods, even though the physical and scientific evidence completely debunks,

94
00:05:33.650 --> 00:05:35.690
that they had the capability of lifting these stones.

95
00:05:35.691 --> 00:05:38.490
So this is where people say, well, hold on. They did it though.

96
00:05:38.510 --> 00:05:39.930
So how do you explain that? You just,

97
00:05:40.230 --> 00:05:43.240
you lack the imagination of what humans are capable of? No,

98
00:05:43.550 --> 00:05:47.640
what I'm suggesting is that this was done by an advanced civilization that dates

99
00:05:47.641 --> 00:05:51.320
back tens of thousands of years, as I've discussed in many other videos. Now,

100
00:05:51.360 --> 00:05:54.520
a lot of people will look at the example of the Coliseum in Rome and say,

101
00:05:54.521 --> 00:05:56.240
wait a second. If the Romans could build that,

102
00:05:56.580 --> 00:05:59.440
why don't you think that they can move and lift these massive stone blocks?

103
00:05:59.510 --> 00:06:02.240
Well, upon a closer inspection of the Coliseum,

104
00:06:02.241 --> 00:06:05.120
they're made up of significantly smaller blocks in cement,

105
00:06:05.470 --> 00:06:10.000
none of which compare even remotely close to any of these blocks in ball back.

106
00:06:10.001 --> 00:06:11.440
In fact, just to clarify,

107
00:06:11.780 --> 00:06:16.040
the largest stone block in all of Rome is 53 tons,

108
00:06:16.050 --> 00:06:20.390
which the capital block of the TRAC column, as you can see here,

109
00:06:20.920 --> 00:06:24.630
53 tons is the largest stone block in all of Rome. Now,

110
00:06:24.631 --> 00:06:27.750
mainstream archeologists and historians will tell you that the Romans did ball

111
00:06:27.990 --> 00:06:31.910
back to show off to outsiders on how their, their incredible capabilities, but,

112
00:06:32.250 --> 00:06:32.551
you know,

113
00:06:32.551 --> 00:06:36.670
this is 1400 miles away from Rome and Rome has nothing that even compares to

114
00:06:36.671 --> 00:06:39.740
that and mean, does that really make sense? Now, speaking of massive blocks,

115
00:06:39.810 --> 00:06:40.620
over in bald,

116
00:06:40.620 --> 00:06:44.780
back at the quarry where these stones came from the largest stone ever cut is

117
00:06:44.800 --> 00:06:46.220
the stone of the pregnant woman.

118
00:06:46.240 --> 00:06:49.460
As it's been called this stone block is more than 20 meters,

119
00:06:49.570 --> 00:06:53.020
long or 67 feet long, 16 feet wide,

120
00:06:53.200 --> 00:06:56.700
and 14 feet high, and is estimated to be at least

121
00:06:58.210 --> 00:06:59.043
1200 tons.

122
00:06:59.510 --> 00:07:04.010
And actually it is no longer the largest stone block ever found as in 2014,

123
00:07:04.580 --> 00:07:08.050
right below, and next to it, they found an even larger stone block,

124
00:07:08.180 --> 00:07:12.490
which is estimated to be between 1600 and 1800 tons,

125
00:07:13.260 --> 00:07:17.130
64 feet long, 20 feet wide and 18 feet tall.

126
00:07:17.970 --> 00:07:21.400
Absolute huge. Now academics will tell you that they cut these blocks.

127
00:07:21.550 --> 00:07:24.680
Once they realized that they were too heavy to move, they just abandoned them.

128
00:07:24.681 --> 00:07:28.160
But it's like, wait a second. Why, why would they cut multiple stone blocks?

129
00:07:28.660 --> 00:07:29.441
And then by the way,

130
00:07:29.441 --> 00:07:32.720
it's also worth mentioning that they believe now that there are more stones like

131
00:07:32.721 --> 00:07:35.320
this also buried underneath. So the question becomes,

132
00:07:35.420 --> 00:07:37.120
why would they cut more than one block?

133
00:07:37.120 --> 00:07:39.950
Which would of course be in a incredible difficulty. I mean,

134
00:07:39.951 --> 00:07:43.670
this is limestone by the way, which isn't particularly, it's not a hard stone,

135
00:07:44.250 --> 00:07:46.310
but what the methods that the Romans did have,

136
00:07:46.550 --> 00:07:48.670
do they even have tools large enough to cut these?

137
00:07:49.370 --> 00:07:53.750
I'm not gonna debate on cutting these stones as it's limestone. But I mean,

138
00:07:53.780 --> 00:07:57.230
just the fact that they would've been so dumb to cut a few of them before

139
00:07:57.231 --> 00:07:58.990
realizing they couldn't move one of them. I mean,

140
00:07:59.450 --> 00:08:02.380
that doesn't make sense either does it, but the bottom line is this,

141
00:08:02.600 --> 00:08:06.940
the Romans did not have the physical or technological capability to move or lift

142
00:08:06.941 --> 00:08:08.060
these massive stone blocks.

143
00:08:08.530 --> 00:08:11.300
They found them just like we've seen in other examples throughout the world,

144
00:08:11.301 --> 00:08:13.580
whether it's in Cusco, Peru and Machu Pichu,

145
00:08:13.840 --> 00:08:17.780
as well as in Egypt where people come in and find other remnants from other

146
00:08:17.781 --> 00:08:19.970
civilizations and they simply build on top of them.

147
00:08:20.150 --> 00:08:22.450
And that is exactly what you're seeing here in Eck Lebanon.

148
00:08:22.870 --> 00:08:26.410
And there is evidence to support this because at this very sight and Eck on this

149
00:08:26.411 --> 00:08:29.330
hill, there's evidence dating back of human civilization,

150
00:08:29.590 --> 00:08:32.410
dating back more than 9,000 years ago.

151
00:08:32.470 --> 00:08:36.730
That's 3000 years before history ever started at 6,000 years ago.

152
00:08:37.110 --> 00:08:39.370
So the evidence is all here, that humans were there.

153
00:08:39.640 --> 00:08:43.200
They had capabilities that exceed anything that we ever thought possible,

154
00:08:44.040 --> 00:08:47.240
and that we can only do today with advanced heavy machinery. Again,

155
00:08:47.241 --> 00:08:49.520
this is a subject of much debates. Let me a comment,

156
00:08:49.800 --> 00:08:51.520
let me know what your ideas are. And real quick,

157
00:08:51.600 --> 00:08:54.920
I wanna mention another YouTuber that I highly recommend that you subscribe to.

158
00:08:55.500 --> 00:08:59.800
<v 1>The channel ancient architects. It's run by a guy named Matt from the UK.</v>

159
00:09:00.310 --> 00:09:03.880
He's looking to leave his nine to five job to pursue his own passions,

160
00:09:03.881 --> 00:09:05.520
which is ancient human civilization.

161
00:09:06.020 --> 00:09:08.800
He makes outstanding videos and he thinks for himself,

162
00:09:08.830 --> 00:09:12.320
he's not afraid to deviate from the likes of Graham Hancock and others of

163
00:09:12.321 --> 00:09:16.070
notoriety. And he just thinks for himself, he makes outstanding videos.

164
00:09:16.210 --> 00:09:19.070
And I highly recommend that you go check him out and subscribe to his channel

165
00:09:19.071 --> 00:09:21.070
because he's just begun in the last few months.

166
00:09:21.370 --> 00:09:24.990
And he's incredibly talented with his editing and his various research.

167
00:09:25.050 --> 00:09:28.190
So go and check him out, but I'll leave it at that. I'm Jimmy,

168
00:09:28.191 --> 00:09:30.830
this is bright insight, like can subscribe and again, leave me a comment.

169
00:09:31.130 --> 00:09:32.350
Let me know what your thoughts are.

170
00:09:32.650 --> 00:09:35.820
And I have many other videos to come on a whole wide radio topics.

171
00:09:36.170 --> 00:09:37.020
Take care of everybody.
