00:00:01.090 --> 00:00:05.770
<v 0>Ancient human civilization was far older and far more advanced than we were ever</v>

2
00:00:05.771 --> 00:00:07.450
taught in school. In fact,

3
00:00:07.451 --> 00:00:11.440
we were a global civilization that spanned multiple continents around the world.

4
00:00:11.740 --> 00:00:12.760
And in this video,

5
00:00:12.880 --> 00:00:16.960
I'm going to show you key evidence ranging from south America, the mid east,

6
00:00:17.080 --> 00:00:19.690
Southeast Asia. And when you connect it all,

7
00:00:19.750 --> 00:00:24.490
it far exceeds the realm of just a coincidence now real quick then to get the

8
00:00:24.491 --> 00:00:27.160
big question out of the way that most people have when they hear this

9
00:00:27.161 --> 00:00:30.730
information for the first time, which is okay if we were so advanced,

10
00:00:30.970 --> 00:00:34.300
what happened to us or where's the evidence like metal buildings? Well,

11
00:00:34.301 --> 00:00:38.020
you must first take into consideration that there was a massive global cataclysm

12
00:00:38.021 --> 00:00:42.520
that happened 13,000 years ago, and a second event, 1400 years later.

13
00:00:42.700 --> 00:00:45.700
It's very likely that he asteroid hit the north American ice shelf,

14
00:00:45.850 --> 00:00:49.150
which caused a massive 400 foot rise in sea level around the world,

15
00:00:49.240 --> 00:00:51.400
a 15 degree Fahrenheit, temperature swing,

16
00:00:51.520 --> 00:00:54.100
and a massive extinction level event of many mammals.

17
00:00:54.340 --> 00:00:55.750
I actually have two videos on this,

18
00:00:55.751 --> 00:00:58.930
which I highly recommend you check them out because the evidence is genuinely

19
00:00:58.931 --> 00:01:02.440
conclusive that these events happened. And as far as metal buildings,

20
00:01:02.441 --> 00:01:06.970
we must take into consideration just how long of a period of time 13,000 years

21
00:01:06.971 --> 00:01:09.370
ago is. I mean, we hear figures like, okay,

22
00:01:09.371 --> 00:01:12.520
the dinosaurs apparently went extinct 66 million years ago.

23
00:01:12.820 --> 00:01:15.940
So when we hear figures like 13,000 years ago, most of us think, okay,

24
00:01:15.941 --> 00:01:19.450
well that's not that long ago, but take, for example, the Titanic,

25
00:01:19.480 --> 00:01:22.120
which had just a couple of days will have been at the bottom of the Atlantic

26
00:01:22.121 --> 00:01:24.280
ocean for 105 years,

27
00:01:24.880 --> 00:01:28.660
nearly 50,000 tons of steel and iron is just disintegrated.

28
00:01:29.020 --> 00:01:30.610
And in just a few hundred more years,

29
00:01:30.700 --> 00:01:34.330
it will be as if it never existed in the first place. Take even cars.

30
00:01:34.331 --> 00:01:37.240
As an example, if you leave them outside for just a few decades,

31
00:01:37.390 --> 00:01:40.510
the rest straight through and completely just get immersed into the earth.

32
00:01:40.630 --> 00:01:44.470
And within a few hundred years, they're non-existent as well or even houses.

33
00:01:44.471 --> 00:01:46.570
If you don't restore house within a few decades,

34
00:01:46.870 --> 00:01:49.300
the roof will cave in the walls will cave in,

35
00:01:49.420 --> 00:01:51.280
and the same thing happens to it as well.

36
00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:56.050
So just imagine what could happen over a period of a thousand years or 5,000

37
00:01:56.051 --> 00:01:59.260
years or even 10 or 13,000 years ago.

38
00:01:59.800 --> 00:02:03.610
Quite literally the only thing that survives that long period of time is stone.

39
00:02:04.240 --> 00:02:05.830
Now let's dive right into the evidence.

40
00:02:06.070 --> 00:02:10.960
There are two lines that connect several ancient civilizations and megalithic

41
00:02:10.961 --> 00:02:15.610
structures ranging from Easter island to Machu Picchu in Peru,

42
00:02:15.611 --> 00:02:19.690
which is right by the Nazca lines, as well as Cusco and Saskatchewan,

43
00:02:19.720 --> 00:02:23.680
which is so mysterious and how these walls were built and how these megalithic

44
00:02:23.681 --> 00:02:27.790
stones were constructed. And when you connect the line from Easter island,

45
00:02:27.791 --> 00:02:32.260
which is so mysterious to Peru all the way across the Atlantic to Mali

46
00:02:32.261 --> 00:02:34.930
Africa, which is the location of the dugong people.

47
00:02:34.930 --> 00:02:38.800
If I pronounce that correctly, which for some reason, in ancient times,

48
00:02:38.801 --> 00:02:43.270
they were aware of star Sirius B, which is invisible to the naked eye.

49
00:02:43.450 --> 00:02:46.210
And it's not something that was apparently discovered for thousands of years

50
00:02:46.211 --> 00:02:48.730
later. Yet somehow they have legends and tales of it.

51
00:02:49.150 --> 00:02:52.000
And this also coincides with the Sumerians,

52
00:02:52.090 --> 00:02:56.620
allegedly the birthplace of civilization and Mesopotamia that they somehow were

53
00:02:56.621 --> 00:02:58.960
aware of the planets within our own solar.

54
00:02:59.620 --> 00:03:02.500
They knew that the earth was bigger than Mars and the Jupiter was bigger than

55
00:03:03.090 --> 00:03:06.040
Saturn, Saturn, bigger than Uranus and so on.

56
00:03:06.280 --> 00:03:09.250
And yet these planets were not supposed to have been discovered for thousands of

57
00:03:09.251 --> 00:03:10.030
years later,

58
00:03:10.030 --> 00:03:14.170
but they somehow knew about it and etched in stone and on clay tablets that were

59
00:03:14.171 --> 00:03:17.710
discovered thousands of years later, it's a total mystery. Now,

60
00:03:17.711 --> 00:03:20.830
when you connect the line straight through the pyramids of Giza and the Sphinx

61
00:03:21.160 --> 00:03:24.280
all the way through to Jordan where Petra is located,

62
00:03:24.310 --> 00:03:27.310
the underground city of Petra, which is so mysterious and of itself,

63
00:03:27.550 --> 00:03:31.330
it could hold more than 20,000 people. No one knows who built it, or when,

64
00:03:31.510 --> 00:03:32.770
and the, even just a year ago,

65
00:03:32.771 --> 00:03:36.970
they found an entirely new entrance with incredible architecture,

66
00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:41.080
more than 160 feet high. And when you connect a line through Petra,

67
00:03:41.230 --> 00:03:45.160
it goes over to the Persepolis in Iran, which is mysterious and of itself,

68
00:03:45.161 --> 00:03:48.070
and there's many theories and who built it in when, however,

69
00:03:48.071 --> 00:03:51.190
when you consider other ancient civilizations and megalithic structures,

70
00:03:51.250 --> 00:03:55.780
we find an entirely other new line that goes from Mesopotamia in Aurora,

71
00:03:55.781 --> 00:04:00.610
where is apparently the birthplace of Muhammad and was just a key site in the

72
00:04:00.611 --> 00:04:04.450
Sumerian culture. And if you connect that line over to Pakistan,

73
00:04:04.570 --> 00:04:07.450
to the ancient civilization of [inaudible]

74
00:04:07.450 --> 00:04:07.450
, and when you continue that line over to Southeast Asia, running through ancient sites in Burma, all the way over to Cambodia, which is the famous site of anger walk, which is very mysterious, it's a site of much speculation and debate, but ultimately there are two lines 

75
00:04:07.450 --> 00:04:07.450
that intersect and these lines, I mean, really, is it

76
00:04:07.450 --> 00:04:08.283
 just a coincidence that all of these megalithic sites just happened to be completely connected along two lines?

77
00:04:30.790 --> 00:04:33.370
Is it possible that it's not a coincidence? Well,

78
00:04:33.371 --> 00:04:36.760
when you tie in other key pieces of evidence ranging from south America to

79
00:04:36.761 --> 00:04:39.820
Egypt, to Southeast Asia, you see that, oh my goodness,

80
00:04:39.821 --> 00:04:44.380
there are incredible similarities between architecture stone structures,

81
00:04:44.620 --> 00:04:49.330
whether it's a similarities of pyramids or even the use of obelisks or the use

82
00:04:49.331 --> 00:04:51.490
of trapezoidal doors, which I've never seen before,

83
00:04:51.491 --> 00:04:54.940
but they just so happen to be located and found in ancient Egypt,

84
00:04:55.030 --> 00:04:57.280
as well as the Incan culture in Peru,

85
00:04:57.610 --> 00:05:01.330
or even take the example of gold funeral masks that were utilized by the Indians

86
00:05:01.331 --> 00:05:02.860
and the Egyptians as well.

87
00:05:03.460 --> 00:05:06.820
And it doesn't stop there just when you consider how they were able to cut and

88
00:05:06.821 --> 00:05:09.040
carve these massive stones and place them.

89
00:05:09.430 --> 00:05:13.180
And yet they share similarities across multiple continents around the world.

90
00:05:13.330 --> 00:05:14.890
You have to start asking questions,

91
00:05:15.560 --> 00:05:19.600
even at similarities between the depiction of the third eye, as well as animals.

92
00:05:19.840 --> 00:05:23.020
That's located at the center of foreheads. And like I said,

93
00:05:23.021 --> 00:05:26.440
when you consider the similarities between architecture and stone structures and

94
00:05:26.441 --> 00:05:30.670
buildings across multiple continents, when you look at these similarities,

95
00:05:30.671 --> 00:05:34.000
you have to ask yourself where they built by the same people. Now,

96
00:05:34.001 --> 00:05:37.480
this leaves me to one major point, which is DNA evidence.

97
00:05:37.780 --> 00:05:42.760
How is it that they're able to find middle Eastern DNA found in

98
00:05:42.790 --> 00:05:47.470
native Americans of north America or even Aboriginal

99
00:05:47.471 --> 00:05:50.710
DNA from Australia found in mummies in south America,

100
00:05:51.670 --> 00:05:55.030
this is completely unexplainable and a total mystery to scientists.

101
00:05:55.300 --> 00:05:58.640
And these articles you can find are a year and they are actively still

102
00:05:58.641 --> 00:06:02.390
researching this topic altogether, but they all agree that it's mysterious.

103
00:06:02.420 --> 00:06:03.290
And to be honest,

104
00:06:03.320 --> 00:06:07.820
it completely debunks the known narrative of the human migrate migration

105
00:06:07.821 --> 00:06:12.590
process across the world. And the evidence goes much further than that. In fact,

106
00:06:12.591 --> 00:06:15.410
they're finding Egypt mummies with traces of cocaine,

107
00:06:15.710 --> 00:06:18.890
which is a complete mystery considering that cocaine,

108
00:06:18.980 --> 00:06:21.290
the cocoa plant originates in south America,

109
00:06:21.530 --> 00:06:24.320
yet Egypt had this thousands of years ago.

110
00:06:24.320 --> 00:06:28.580
Somehow when those plants originate nowhere near that region of the world.

111
00:06:28.670 --> 00:06:30.860
So how is that possible? I mean, after all,

112
00:06:30.861 --> 00:06:34.400
when you consider these incredible lines that connect megalithic structures in

113
00:06:34.410 --> 00:06:37.130
ancient civilizations that are so mysterious and of themselves,

114
00:06:37.400 --> 00:06:40.130
we consider the incredible similarities between cultures,

115
00:06:40.220 --> 00:06:43.550
stone structures and stone buildings and DNA evidence.

116
00:06:43.640 --> 00:06:45.920
And when you combine all of this information together,

117
00:06:46.220 --> 00:06:50.210
it's abundantly clear that there was a global civilization that existed.

118
00:06:50.390 --> 00:06:54.290
And we were wiped out back to the stone age, approximately 13,000 years ago,

119
00:06:54.350 --> 00:06:58.850
and 11,600 years ago when these two massive cataclysms happen here on earth,

120
00:06:58.880 --> 00:06:59.750
which we know of.

121
00:07:00.020 --> 00:07:03.020
And yet the mainstream scientists and archeologists and historians,

122
00:07:03.170 --> 00:07:06.620
no one wants to touch on the subject of the cataclysm. And again,

123
00:07:06.621 --> 00:07:08.930
watch the two videos that I put out. And there's other topics,

124
00:07:09.140 --> 00:07:10.490
people to discuss this as well.

125
00:07:10.610 --> 00:07:13.310
I highly recommend you check out the works of Graham Hancock,

126
00:07:13.460 --> 00:07:16.220
who outlines this in detail on Graham hancock.com.

127
00:07:16.430 --> 00:07:20.390
And he was covering this from as far back as 2001. It's incredible.

128
00:07:20.391 --> 00:07:24.500
And he goes into much further detail of how these megalithic sites connect

129
00:07:24.501 --> 00:07:27.470
around the world in incredible patterns. That,

130
00:07:27.471 --> 00:07:30.200
to be honest are far more impressive than what I discussed here today,

131
00:07:30.650 --> 00:07:33.980
and be sure to check out his podcast with Joe Rogan and Randall Carlson,

132
00:07:34.130 --> 00:07:37.100
where they discuss all the overwhelming evidence of the cataclysm.

133
00:07:37.580 --> 00:07:39.560
Also check out the works of Brian Forester,

134
00:07:39.620 --> 00:07:42.890
who has a YouTube channel as well as a website, hidden in Couture's dot com.

135
00:07:42.891 --> 00:07:44.900
And by the way, real quick, I don't know any of these people,

136
00:07:45.290 --> 00:07:47.630
but their works have been, are so incredible.

137
00:07:47.870 --> 00:07:52.160
And the mainstream scientists are trying to keep these guys out of the picture.

138
00:07:52.161 --> 00:07:54.470
It's insane, even though they have evidence it's overwhelming.

139
00:07:54.560 --> 00:07:57.740
So check out these individuals yourself, come to your own conclusions,

140
00:07:57.860 --> 00:08:00.410
but when you start connecting the dots and how they're able to cut and carve

141
00:08:00.411 --> 00:08:03.710
stones that even modern day stonemasons completely disagree with.

142
00:08:03.920 --> 00:08:05.210
And when you look at how well, okay,

143
00:08:05.211 --> 00:08:06.800
the primitive methods that have been suggested,

144
00:08:06.830 --> 00:08:09.710
suggested by archeologists and Egyptologists,

145
00:08:09.890 --> 00:08:13.010
don't compute because of the tens of millions of stone blocks,

146
00:08:13.040 --> 00:08:17.510
statues and structures found just in Egypt alone could not have been done with

147
00:08:17.511 --> 00:08:21.110
those primitive methods anywhere within the realm of time. In fact,

148
00:08:21.111 --> 00:08:24.170
it's still be working on them today. So something doesn't add up,

149
00:08:24.260 --> 00:08:28.100
we are absolutely far older and we're far more advanced than the textbooks are

150
00:08:28.101 --> 00:08:30.710
currently teaching everyone in school. Anyways,

151
00:08:30.711 --> 00:08:32.420
I'll leave it at that lichen subscribe,

152
00:08:32.421 --> 00:08:34.130
leave me a comment and share your thoughts.

153
00:08:34.340 --> 00:08:37.010
And I have many other videos and a whole wide variety of topics.

154
00:08:37.280 --> 00:08:38.150
Take care of everybody.
