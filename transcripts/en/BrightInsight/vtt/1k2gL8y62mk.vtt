00:00:01.830 --> 00:00:06.000
<v 0>To know that there are some things that you cannot know is mental health,</v>

2
00:00:06.510 --> 00:00:10.200
but to not know things that you should know, his illness,

3
00:00:10.770 --> 00:00:14.160
the wise man recognizes the limits of his knowledge.

4
00:00:14.580 --> 00:00:17.130
The foolish man thinks he knows everything.

5
00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:22.500
Chapter 71 ignorance of the Dao de Ching.

6
00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:25.800
This is part two. I made another video on this,

7
00:00:25.801 --> 00:00:29.010
where I discussed that ancient humans were clearly smarter than us.

8
00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:33.360
They were far more awakened and enlightened to the collective whole of the human

9
00:00:33.361 --> 00:00:35.160
race in our entire civilization.

10
00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:38.850
Well then that the leaders that run the entire show do now, I mean,

11
00:00:38.900 --> 00:00:42.180
you take into consideration the leaders of corporations,

12
00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:44.940
the media governments, all over the world.

13
00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:50.160
It's beyond obvious that we're being led by those who have selfish

14
00:00:50.161 --> 00:00:54.540
ambitions. Those who are putting their own desire for money, power,

15
00:00:54.541 --> 00:00:58.740
and fame before the masses, this is abundantly clear. However,

16
00:00:58.741 --> 00:01:02.160
if the whole world was to start teaching their children from, I don't know,

17
00:01:02.161 --> 00:01:06.600
grade school on up the information contained in the ancient wisdom of the Dao de

18
00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:10.860
Ching, this world would improve far quicker than most of us realize. Now,

19
00:01:10.861 --> 00:01:12.330
if you're not familiar with the Dao de Ching,

20
00:01:12.331 --> 00:01:15.210
and I'm going to read a few more of my favorite passages in just a second,

21
00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:17.340
but if you're not familiar with the Dao de Ching,

22
00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:21.180
it translates to the book of the way or the book of the way of virtue,

23
00:01:21.181 --> 00:01:25.380
depending on the dialect that you use to translate it and who wrote it.

24
00:01:25.381 --> 00:01:27.690
And when is a subject of debate, however,

25
00:01:27.691 --> 00:01:32.010
most people believe that it was written by Lao-Tzu in the fourth century

26
00:01:32.011 --> 00:01:36.330
BC. And when you look at this whole book after having read it, and by the way,

27
00:01:36.331 --> 00:01:40.470
it's only 81 chapters and each chapter is less than one page in length,

28
00:01:40.471 --> 00:01:42.930
and most chapters are actually just a few sentences.

29
00:01:43.110 --> 00:01:45.450
So you can read it very quickly in less than a half hour,

30
00:01:45.510 --> 00:01:49.470
although you'd want to take more time to reflect on it, of course. Um,

31
00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:54.270
but when you look at it from just the whole, you have to ask yourself who,

32
00:01:54.300 --> 00:01:58.170
I mean, how did someone come to such incredible enlightenment and knowledge?

33
00:01:58.440 --> 00:02:01.110
I mean, I would venture to say, and I, I can't prove this.

34
00:02:01.111 --> 00:02:05.970
This is just a theory that maybe some of these, uh, Proverbs or poems,

35
00:02:06.120 --> 00:02:08.790
uh, they've been called different things, but these individual chapters,

36
00:02:08.970 --> 00:02:12.960
some of them might date back far earlier than 2,500 years. Just a theory,

37
00:02:12.961 --> 00:02:17.100
not necessarily true, but the question becomes, and when you read this,

38
00:02:17.101 --> 00:02:19.320
you just see and know the truth as you'll see,

39
00:02:19.321 --> 00:02:23.190
as I share a few passages here with you that, I mean, my goodness,

40
00:02:23.191 --> 00:02:27.630
somebody would have had to observed and analyzed numerous civilizations,

41
00:02:27.720 --> 00:02:32.010
the rise and fall of numerous civilizations and numerous leaders, good leaders,

42
00:02:32.011 --> 00:02:34.830
and poor leaders to be able to come up with this information.

43
00:02:35.040 --> 00:02:39.990
It's absolutely incredible. So as I just read number 71, which is ignorance,

44
00:02:39.991 --> 00:02:40.771
which just, I mean,

45
00:02:40.771 --> 00:02:43.650
isn't that just brilliant that there are people out there that just think they

46
00:02:43.651 --> 00:02:47.130
know everything, but smart people wise, people recognize it. Now,

47
00:02:47.131 --> 00:02:50.190
there are some things we just cannot know. It's just the way it is.

48
00:02:50.820 --> 00:02:53.820
So without further ado, let me read a few more passages to you.

49
00:02:54.210 --> 00:02:58.890
Opposites when beauty is only a masquerade than it is simply

50
00:03:00.280 --> 00:03:01.540
in the same way. Goodness.

51
00:03:01.570 --> 00:03:06.550
If it is not sincere is not really goodness existence and non-existence

52
00:03:06.580 --> 00:03:07.870
are incompatible.

53
00:03:08.440 --> 00:03:12.880
The difficult in the easy are mutually opposed the long and the short,

54
00:03:13.060 --> 00:03:14.080
the high and the low,

55
00:03:14.260 --> 00:03:18.700
the loud and the soft the before and the behind are all opposites.

56
00:03:19.120 --> 00:03:20.830
Each reveals the other,

57
00:03:21.280 --> 00:03:25.750
the wise man is not conspicuous in his actions or given to too much talking when

58
00:03:25.751 --> 00:03:30.220
troubles arise. He is not irritated. He produces, but does not hoard.

59
00:03:30.550 --> 00:03:35.140
He acts but expects no praise. He builds, but does not dwell there in.

60
00:03:35.620 --> 00:03:38.470
And because he does not dwell there in, he never departs.

61
00:03:38.710 --> 00:03:42.850
Now the part about this that I want to discuss real quick is the opposites that

62
00:03:42.851 --> 00:03:44.680
everything reveals each other. I mean, this goes,

63
00:03:44.681 --> 00:03:47.530
and I'm going to make a video on the Emerald tablets, the, as above.

64
00:03:47.531 --> 00:03:49.480
So below that in this universe,

65
00:03:49.481 --> 00:03:52.840
part of the law of the universe is that there's just an opposite to everything,

66
00:03:53.050 --> 00:03:55.600
light, dark, and everything in between. I mean,

67
00:03:55.601 --> 00:04:00.400
you could even look at birth and death that there is a rise until your peak

68
00:04:00.610 --> 00:04:04.000
and then a gradual decline. So you could say that the middle of each the,

69
00:04:04.030 --> 00:04:08.890
between birth and peak versus the peak to death, there's an opposite there too.

70
00:04:08.891 --> 00:04:09.760
Do you see what I'm saying?

71
00:04:10.150 --> 00:04:13.330
And it's also worth mentioning the part about good that, you know,

72
00:04:13.720 --> 00:04:17.290
if beauty is only a masquerade than its ugliness in the same way that if

73
00:04:17.291 --> 00:04:20.860
goodness isn't sincere than it, isn't goodness. I mean, isn't that true? I mean,

74
00:04:20.861 --> 00:04:25.300
is there any debate about that? So let me move on to number six, the source,

75
00:04:25.301 --> 00:04:29.380
which is very short, as you can see the spirit of the perennial spring,

76
00:04:29.530 --> 00:04:31.180
which by the way, perennial is infinite.

77
00:04:31.181 --> 00:04:35.770
The never-ending is said to be in mortal. She is called the mysterious one.

78
00:04:36.160 --> 00:04:38.890
The mysterious one is the source of heaven and earth.

79
00:04:39.310 --> 00:04:43.210
She is continually endlessly giving forth life without effort.

80
00:04:43.900 --> 00:04:45.790
I like how it says she it's interesting.

81
00:04:45.940 --> 00:04:50.290
Cause when you look at ancient Egyptians, as an example, women, the females,

82
00:04:50.291 --> 00:04:53.140
they were running the show, they were the leaders. Were they not? Uh,

83
00:04:53.141 --> 00:04:55.780
the hierarchy was a matriarch,

84
00:04:55.810 --> 00:04:58.740
just like in the animal kingdom of elephants. The,

85
00:04:58.741 --> 00:05:01.780
the women lead the way and there's been other civilizations that have been the

86
00:05:01.781 --> 00:05:04.840
same way. I find it interesting that it refers to as she,

87
00:05:05.020 --> 00:05:06.670
as the giving forth of life.

88
00:05:06.850 --> 00:05:10.360
But that universe is always giving birth and everything completes itself,

89
00:05:10.540 --> 00:05:15.160
that everything ties together in the source of all things is what

90
00:05:15.161 --> 00:05:17.350
creates. And we are all part of that source.

91
00:05:17.770 --> 00:05:20.200
Nikola Tesla discussed this into some detail,

92
00:05:20.320 --> 00:05:23.530
which I discussed in a few of those videos, as I'm sure most of you have seen.

93
00:05:24.040 --> 00:05:26.410
So let me move on now to eight, which is goodness,

94
00:05:26.411 --> 00:05:30.520
which we touched on briefly in opposites. True.

95
00:05:30.521 --> 00:05:34.210
Goodness is like water in nurtures, everything in harms,

96
00:05:34.211 --> 00:05:38.560
nothing like water. It ever seeks the lowest place,

97
00:05:39.040 --> 00:05:41.140
the place that all others avoid.

98
00:05:41.710 --> 00:05:44.680
This is the way of the Dow for a dwelling.

99
00:05:44.740 --> 00:05:49.540
It chooses the quiet meadow for a heart. The circling Eddy in generosity,

100
00:05:49.541 --> 00:05:51.940
it is kind in speech. It is sincere.

101
00:05:52.510 --> 00:05:56.350
And the authority it is order in action. It is gentle and movement.

102
00:05:56.351 --> 00:06:00.650
It is rhythm because it is always peaceable it soothers and

103
00:06:00.680 --> 00:06:05.360
refreshes. I love the part, how it discusses early on that like water,

104
00:06:05.361 --> 00:06:08.510
it seeks the lowest place, the place that all others avoid.

105
00:06:08.720 --> 00:06:13.370
This is the way of the Dao. This is, I mean, you could tie this into Christ.

106
00:06:14.060 --> 00:06:16.610
Uh, you know, guys, anyone that needs help,

107
00:06:16.640 --> 00:06:19.850
the people that truly need help are the ones that usually most people,

108
00:06:19.851 --> 00:06:22.130
the masses will seem to avoid those who need it.

109
00:06:22.131 --> 00:06:25.400
Most like people that are addicts, people that are poor.

110
00:06:25.401 --> 00:06:27.470
A lot of people need a helping hand. And my helping hand,

111
00:06:27.471 --> 00:06:30.440
I'm not saying here's a bunch of money, but think about it.

112
00:06:30.770 --> 00:06:35.390
Water seeks the lowest place as does. Goodness. Doesn't that make sense?

113
00:06:35.690 --> 00:06:40.160
So those out there who are truly good, they don't just avoid the lowest areas.

114
00:06:40.190 --> 00:06:43.640
Those are the places that they seek just like water and water gives us

115
00:06:43.641 --> 00:06:46.910
everything. Let me move on to nine prudence.

116
00:06:47.630 --> 00:06:52.130
If you continue filling a pail after it is full, the water will be wasted.

117
00:06:52.610 --> 00:06:55.190
If you continue grinding an ax after it is sharp,

118
00:06:55.250 --> 00:06:59.750
the edge will wear away who can protect a house full of gold and

119
00:06:59.751 --> 00:07:00.584
jewels.

120
00:07:01.010 --> 00:07:05.390
Excessive fortune brings about its own misfortune or money,

121
00:07:05.391 --> 00:07:09.710
more problems to intru merit to earn a good

122
00:07:09.711 --> 00:07:13.730
reputation. You must be prudent. This is the way of the Dow.

123
00:07:14.270 --> 00:07:17.330
Think about it guys. I've had a very interesting life. I've had,

124
00:07:17.331 --> 00:07:20.810
I've been well off. I've lived poor and everywhere in between. Uh,

125
00:07:20.870 --> 00:07:22.430
and I can tell you that, honestly,

126
00:07:22.520 --> 00:07:26.300
it just seems that more material materialism or money more,

127
00:07:26.780 --> 00:07:31.100
the more focus you have on riches it's man,

128
00:07:31.120 --> 00:07:33.530
it doesn't bring a pot. It doesn't bring upon you.

129
00:07:33.650 --> 00:07:36.530
What you truly seek in the world is seeing this as a whole. We are,

130
00:07:36.650 --> 00:07:41.420
as a global civilization are largely living a more materialistic life

131
00:07:41.660 --> 00:07:43.430
than ever before. Arguably,

132
00:07:43.880 --> 00:07:46.280
and yet you can say that there's more suffering in this world than there's ever

133
00:07:46.281 --> 00:07:49.250
been. Of course that's debatable too, right? I mean, look at world war II,

134
00:07:49.280 --> 00:07:50.210
the whole world suffered,

135
00:07:50.750 --> 00:07:54.800
but the point is this materialism does not bring happiness. Well,

136
00:07:55.010 --> 00:07:58.820
it does so, but it's very, very shortsighted. It's very, I mean,

137
00:07:58.990 --> 00:08:01.160
thinking about anyone that buys something new might be excited about it,

138
00:08:01.161 --> 00:08:04.340
but how often before that wears off before they want the next best thing,

139
00:08:04.730 --> 00:08:08.510
but it surely makes a great point. So let me move on to number 11, which I,

140
00:08:08.810 --> 00:08:12.080
which is called materiality, which I shared in my prior video, but it's,

141
00:08:12.140 --> 00:08:14.990
it's so important, especially in 2017.

142
00:08:15.110 --> 00:08:17.870
And it ties right in with what I was just saying about materialism.

143
00:08:18.080 --> 00:08:20.210
So I'll have to read this probably in part three as well.

144
00:08:20.211 --> 00:08:23.420
You can't leave this one out a wheel may have 30 spokes,

145
00:08:23.690 --> 00:08:28.490
but it's usefulness lies within the empty hub. A jar is formed from clay,

146
00:08:28.610 --> 00:08:31.130
but its usefulness lies within the empty center.

147
00:08:32.090 --> 00:08:34.070
A Rome is made from four walls,

148
00:08:34.370 --> 00:08:39.230
but its usefulness lies in the space between in the same way matter is

149
00:08:39.231 --> 00:08:40.640
necessary to give form.

150
00:08:41.000 --> 00:08:44.330
But the value of reality lies in its immateriality.

151
00:08:44.570 --> 00:08:47.210
That is everything that lives has a physical body,

152
00:08:47.810 --> 00:08:52.550
but the value of a life is measured by the soul. Amen.

153
00:08:52.551 --> 00:08:54.830
Right? I mean, oh my goodness. It's so true.

154
00:08:54.960 --> 00:08:57.300
The value of life is measured by the soul.

155
00:08:57.510 --> 00:09:01.380
And you can also say that soul is the source of all things that make up,

156
00:09:01.440 --> 00:09:03.900
well say a room of four walls at all.

157
00:09:03.900 --> 00:09:06.630
Everything here is made up of what comes from the source,

158
00:09:07.020 --> 00:09:10.380
but the measure of it is what's within it. Just like the measure of a person.

159
00:09:10.381 --> 00:09:14.070
Isn't what they look like. It's what's within their character,

160
00:09:14.190 --> 00:09:17.640
their soul number 12, seek spirit,

161
00:09:18.480 --> 00:09:22.440
too much light blinds, the eye too much noise deferens the ear,

162
00:09:22.590 --> 00:09:26.400
too many spices, a taste, too much exercise weakens the body.

163
00:09:26.910 --> 00:09:31.290
The pursuit of great riches leads to ruin the wise man attends to the inner

164
00:09:31.291 --> 00:09:34.770
truth of things. And he is not fooled by outward appearances.

165
00:09:35.070 --> 00:09:37.230
He ignores matter and seeks the spirits.

166
00:09:37.530 --> 00:09:41.400
I can tell you this from my own life experiences, my goodness.

167
00:09:41.590 --> 00:09:43.080
And in many others will tell you this. In fact,

168
00:09:43.081 --> 00:09:46.470
you can just look in simply into celebrity culture or the powers that be,

169
00:09:46.471 --> 00:09:49.470
whether it be politicians and world leaders or even, uh,

170
00:09:49.500 --> 00:09:50.970
leaders of corporations,

171
00:09:51.300 --> 00:09:54.360
they're all trying to achieve something that they just cannot fulfill.

172
00:09:54.390 --> 00:09:57.990
And that it ultimately leads to the ruin. They have many problems, divorces,

173
00:09:57.991 --> 00:09:59.580
terrible relationship with their kids,

174
00:09:59.910 --> 00:10:04.200
total disgrace and going down like the dark end of the addiction and everything

175
00:10:04.201 --> 00:10:06.810
else. We know this is this not true.

176
00:10:07.020 --> 00:10:11.250
And yet the ancients were talking about this at least closer to 2,500 years ago.

177
00:10:11.940 --> 00:10:13.170
It's ops. It makes you think doesn't it.

178
00:10:13.440 --> 00:10:18.330
What was just as true back then thousands of years ago is unbelievably true

179
00:10:18.331 --> 00:10:23.250
today. Humans haven't changed. Have we now to close this up, uh,

180
00:10:23.280 --> 00:10:27.630
for this one video, I'm going to go back and read. I read this from the last,

181
00:10:28.260 --> 00:10:33.240
uh, video, but the very last chapter of the book, 81, true words,

182
00:10:33.570 --> 00:10:36.450
not too long, but this is just freaking brilliant.

183
00:10:37.710 --> 00:10:41.760
True words are often unpleasant pleasant words are often untrue.

184
00:10:42.120 --> 00:10:46.710
Those who know the truth, do not argue those who argue, do not know the truth.

185
00:10:47.220 --> 00:10:51.930
Scholars are seldom the wisest men, wisest men are seldom scholars.

186
00:10:52.590 --> 00:10:55.590
Those who steal from others, impoverish themselves.

187
00:10:56.010 --> 00:10:58.110
Those who give to others become rich.

188
00:10:58.710 --> 00:11:02.580
Those who fight do not win those who win, do not fight.

189
00:11:03.030 --> 00:11:06.690
This is the way of the Dow. Is that not brilliant?

190
00:11:06.720 --> 00:11:11.460
Honestly again, when you stop and you reflect on this entire book in its whole,

191
00:11:12.030 --> 00:11:13.980
it's unbelievable. Like I said,

192
00:11:13.981 --> 00:11:17.550
just how true that wisdom was thousands of years ago, which,

193
00:11:17.700 --> 00:11:21.150
and I also suspect dates back for the 2,500 years as I stated earlier,

194
00:11:21.450 --> 00:11:24.990
but just how applicable it is today. So I highly recommend this book.

195
00:11:24.991 --> 00:11:28.710
I hope you enjoyed this. Me sharings, just some insight on this. Um,

196
00:11:28.800 --> 00:11:31.530
but I highly recommend it. I think you should buy it. And again,

197
00:11:31.531 --> 00:11:34.500
this is something that should be taught to every child starting from the grade

198
00:11:34.501 --> 00:11:38.400
school level on upwards. Anyways, I'll leave it at that. I'm Jimmy,

199
00:11:38.401 --> 00:11:40.740
this is bright insight like and subscribe and leave me a comment.

200
00:11:40.741 --> 00:11:41.850
Let me know what your thoughts are.

201
00:11:41.880 --> 00:11:44.850
And I have many more videos to come and a whole wide variety of topics.

202
00:11:45.300 --> 00:11:46.200
Take care of everybody.
