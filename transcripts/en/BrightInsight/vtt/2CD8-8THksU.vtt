00:00:01.000 --> 00:00:04.820
<v 0>It was announced today that they discovered an entirely new pyramid in Egypt,</v>

2
00:00:04.850 --> 00:00:08.980
outside of chiro, not far from the bent pyramid in Dacher Egypt.

3
00:00:09.440 --> 00:00:11.900
Now the information about this site is very limited.

4
00:00:12.350 --> 00:00:16.740
Every source that I could find only provided four photos of the entire site

5
00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:20.540
and the all claim that it's approximately 3,700 years old,

6
00:00:20.910 --> 00:00:24.770
but yet they have zero sources or any type of evidence to back that up

7
00:00:24.771 --> 00:00:28.530
whatsoever. The information is pretty much limited to that.

8
00:00:28.550 --> 00:00:31.090
And as you can see on these articles that I screenshotted here,

9
00:00:31.091 --> 00:00:33.930
that's literally all the information that they provided.

10
00:00:34.640 --> 00:00:36.250
They know that they found an inner corridor.

11
00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:40.610
They know that they found a stone plaque of some kind with 10 hi lye on it,

12
00:00:40.830 --> 00:00:45.800
but they have zero evidence whatsoever of how old it is, who made it. And when,

13
00:00:46.180 --> 00:00:47.013
and in this video,

14
00:00:47.060 --> 00:00:51.280
I'm gonna show you definitive evidence in the case of the great Finks,

15
00:00:51.281 --> 00:00:52.114
as an example,

16
00:00:52.270 --> 00:00:57.200
that proves that the true age of these megalithic sites are far older than

17
00:00:57.201 --> 00:01:00.280
we were ever taught in school. And that what the textbooks currently state.

18
00:01:00.900 --> 00:01:04.430
Now you've seen all these photographs, literally, that's all that we have of it.

19
00:01:04.450 --> 00:01:07.070
And I scoured the internet for as much information as I could.

20
00:01:07.450 --> 00:01:11.910
But then we take this opportunity to share with you actual photographs of the

21
00:01:11.911 --> 00:01:13.590
enclosure of the great Finks,

22
00:01:13.591 --> 00:01:17.190
which according to Egyptologists and the minister of antiquities of Egypt,

23
00:01:17.191 --> 00:01:21.750
which provided us the same information on this newly found pyramid also

24
00:01:22.230 --> 00:01:22.901
claims that the,

25
00:01:22.901 --> 00:01:27.740
the greats FIS is approximately 4,500 years old yet despite more

26
00:01:27.741 --> 00:01:31.420
than 200 professional geologists from around the world that have visited the

27
00:01:31.421 --> 00:01:36.300
site clearly state that there is absolute definitive evidence of

28
00:01:36.301 --> 00:01:40.780
water erosion around the enclosure of the S Finks. Now, when Thesys was found,

29
00:01:40.960 --> 00:01:43.970
it had been buried for some say thousands of years,

30
00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:49.210
and there is evidence of wind erosion on the limestone of the great Finks that

31
00:01:49.211 --> 00:01:52.410
you can see here. However, around the enclosure,

32
00:01:52.790 --> 00:01:56.770
the evidence of the limestone water erosion is overwhelming. And, and in fact,

33
00:01:56.771 --> 00:02:00.570
you can even look for evidence on your own on Google images of examples of

34
00:02:00.571 --> 00:02:03.640
limestone with wind erosion versus water erosion.

35
00:02:03.980 --> 00:02:05.840
And you can see with your own eyes that, yeah,

36
00:02:05.841 --> 00:02:09.360
literally it is absolutely water erosion yet. Here's the kicker.

37
00:02:09.420 --> 00:02:12.920
The last time that the Nile Delta received rainfall that could have made this

38
00:02:12.921 --> 00:02:16.240
type of erosion was more than 7,000 years ago.

39
00:02:17.180 --> 00:02:20.520
That's closer to double the age of what they're telling us about the great

40
00:02:20.650 --> 00:02:22.240
Finks. So it doesn't compute.

41
00:02:22.420 --> 00:02:26.750
And quite literally the evidence is overwhelming that the age of the great Finks

42
00:02:26.751 --> 00:02:30.950
and other megalithic sites from around the world are far older than what we're

43
00:02:30.951 --> 00:02:33.550
being taught yet. Despite the overwhelming evidence,

44
00:02:33.800 --> 00:02:37.950
mainstream science archeology, just completely disregards and,

45
00:02:37.970 --> 00:02:41.350
and ignores the subject altogether. Does else else wonder why that is?

46
00:02:41.740 --> 00:02:45.420
Does anyone else wonder how they come up with the figure of a buried,

47
00:02:45.710 --> 00:02:48.740
newly found pyramid to just be 3,700 years old?

48
00:02:49.330 --> 00:02:52.460
There's no date on the site guys, like how do they come up with that?

49
00:02:53.040 --> 00:02:55.820
And if you study the subject on your own and utilize discernment,

50
00:02:55.821 --> 00:02:58.260
you will see that. Well, everything's just based on theories.

51
00:02:58.600 --> 00:02:59.433
And the overwhelming.

52
00:02:59.760 --> 00:03:01.960
<v 1>Evidence concludes that these theories have been debunked.</v>

53
00:03:03.230 --> 00:03:06.320
I'll be sure to make another video as more information comes to light on this

54
00:03:06.321 --> 00:03:09.560
newly discovered pyramid. And I have many videos on this subject as well.

55
00:03:10.070 --> 00:03:13.120
Anyways, guys, I'll leave it at that. I'm Jimmy, this is bright insight.

56
00:03:13.121 --> 00:03:14.720
Like can subscribe, help me spread the message.

57
00:03:15.380 --> 00:03:17.920
And I have many other videos and a whole wide variety of topics.

58
00:03:18.110 --> 00:03:19.510
Take care of everybody. All.
