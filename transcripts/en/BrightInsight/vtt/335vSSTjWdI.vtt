00:00:01.820 --> 00:00:06.040
<v 0>So did anyone else find it odd that when moon express announced two days ago on</v>

2
00:00:06.041 --> 00:00:06.681
July 12th,

3
00:00:06.681 --> 00:00:09.120
which you may have seen the headlines going around all over the world,

4
00:00:09.750 --> 00:00:14.240
that they're going to establish the very first outpost ever on the moon to

5
00:00:14.241 --> 00:00:16.640
conduct mining operations by 2020.

6
00:00:17.300 --> 00:00:21.470
But the part that really cut me off guard was the location of this robotic

7
00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:22.380
outpost.

8
00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:25.470
<v 1>They're gonna put it at the south pole of the moon, which is what, oh,</v>

9
00:00:25.510 --> 00:00:27.070
I don't know, seven, 800,

10
00:00:27.071 --> 00:00:30.950
maybe even closer to a thousand miles from where humans have ever even stepped

11
00:00:30.951 --> 00:00:35.270
foot. And they're gonna do chose that place for the very first mining operation.

12
00:00:36.290 --> 00:00:39.550
Huh? Interesting choice. I mean, what brought them to that decision?

13
00:00:39.980 --> 00:00:44.100
It's almost as if the, they know something that, well, we don't, you know,

14
00:00:44.101 --> 00:00:48.340
there's many questions in mysteries about our moon that have gone unanswered and

15
00:00:48.341 --> 00:00:52.780
I find it really interesting that NASA has no plans to go back to the moon yet.

16
00:00:52.780 --> 00:00:56.300
<v 0>All they talk about is Mars, Mars, Mars. I mean, take, for example,</v>

17
00:00:56.480 --> 00:00:57.660
in January of this year,

18
00:00:57.760 --> 00:01:02.570
how scientists from UCLA determine that the moon is significantly older

19
00:01:02.600 --> 00:01:06.090
than we ever thought. In fact, it might even be as old or older than the earth,

20
00:01:06.110 --> 00:01:07.970
or as old as the solar system itself,

21
00:01:08.180 --> 00:01:12.210
which raises all kinds of questions involving its origins. In fact,

22
00:01:12.211 --> 00:01:15.610
the mysteries go far deeper than that besides the fact that they have found

23
00:01:15.640 --> 00:01:18.130
processed metals, such as brass and Mica on the moon,

24
00:01:18.400 --> 00:01:23.040
they have also found uranium 2 36 and neptunium two seven on the moon.

25
00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:25.360
Well, why is that significant? Well,

26
00:01:25.361 --> 00:01:28.360
besides the fact that this is seldom ever discussed, and by the way,

27
00:01:28.361 --> 00:01:32.120
this comes from NASA scientists, themselves and scientists at MIT. I mean,

28
00:01:32.121 --> 00:01:35.120
this isn't a secret, but nobody talks about it.

29
00:01:35.121 --> 00:01:37.440
It's like they discovered this and just left it alone.

30
00:01:37.900 --> 00:01:42.440
But more specifically in why this is so interesting is that these elements have,

31
00:01:42.550 --> 00:01:45.430
have never been found to occur. Naturally. In fact,

32
00:01:45.431 --> 00:01:48.430
uranium 2 36 is a radioactive nuclear waste,

33
00:01:48.431 --> 00:01:51.870
which is found in spent nuclear and reprocessed uranium.

34
00:01:52.370 --> 00:01:57.270
But even more interesting is that Netton 2 37 is a radioactive metallic element

35
00:01:57.650 --> 00:02:02.190
and a byproduct of nuclear reactors and the production of plutonium.

36
00:02:02.570 --> 00:02:07.540
But this law known fact of process metals and artificial elements on the moon is

37
00:02:07.740 --> 00:02:11.140
just seemingly left out of any conversation from the mainstream or even NASA

38
00:02:11.460 --> 00:02:13.700
altogether. I mean, it's not a secret,

39
00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:17.340
but literally you have to be a weirdo like me and go looking for the information

40
00:02:17.341 --> 00:02:20.380
to find it. You know, many people don't believe that we went to the moon,

41
00:02:20.560 --> 00:02:23.850
but there is a significant amount of evidence that shows that you, yeah,

42
00:02:23.851 --> 00:02:25.250
we have indeed been to the moon.

43
00:02:25.830 --> 00:02:30.130
The real question is when did we first go to the moon? What did we find there?

44
00:02:30.270 --> 00:02:31.770
And when's the last time we've been there.

45
00:02:32.080 --> 00:02:35.610
Does anyone else think that it's odd that the United States in the middle of a

46
00:02:35.611 --> 00:02:40.330
cold war and a space race with Russia would send a couple astronauts to the moon

47
00:02:40.390 --> 00:02:43.970
for the very first time on live TV in front of a global audio,

48
00:02:44.510 --> 00:02:48.040
knowing that there was incredible risk end dangers and the likelihood that they

49
00:02:48.041 --> 00:02:52.840
would well die in the process insiders have told and spoke about this before.

50
00:02:52.841 --> 00:02:54.200
And many people have shunned them. I mean,

51
00:02:54.230 --> 00:02:57.400
Alex Jones has reported on this and I'm not an Alex Jones fan,

52
00:02:57.401 --> 00:03:00.200
to be honest with you, but he's been right about a number of things.

53
00:03:00.201 --> 00:03:02.560
So you can't just dismiss everything he says altogether,

54
00:03:03.300 --> 00:03:05.960
but regardless he claims that really the story is that look,

55
00:03:05.961 --> 00:03:09.960
Neil Armstrong and buzz Alder were not the first on the moon. Hence why? I mean,

56
00:03:09.961 --> 00:03:13.800
look at the Apollo 11 press conference on how unbelievably awkward that is.

57
00:03:13.990 --> 00:03:16.640
They lack any enthusiasm for it whatsoever.

58
00:03:16.710 --> 00:03:20.750
Despite just coming back from the first people to set foot on the moon and being

59
00:03:20.770 --> 00:03:22.710
global superheroes overnight,

60
00:03:23.210 --> 00:03:25.790
yet they beca they came home and became massive drunks.

61
00:03:25.980 --> 00:03:29.870
Neil Armstrong did as little public appearances as possible to the point where

62
00:03:29.871 --> 00:03:30.750
he off NASA.

63
00:03:31.210 --> 00:03:35.030
And then he went into hiding for more than three decades without doing a single,

64
00:03:35.470 --> 00:03:39.300
uh, formal public interview about his experience. I mean, that's really all odd,

65
00:03:39.680 --> 00:03:42.660
to be honest with you, I think we're there right now and that we never left.

66
00:03:43.360 --> 00:03:44.540
If you think that sounds crazy,

67
00:03:44.650 --> 00:03:47.180
then you should probably start asking yourself what in the world,

68
00:03:47.360 --> 00:03:51.020
our deep state intelligence agencies did with the more than six and a half

69
00:03:51.220 --> 00:03:53.820
trillion that has just vanished from the Pentagon. I mean,

70
00:03:53.821 --> 00:03:56.100
you may have seen these stories circulating around the, uh,

71
00:03:56.330 --> 00:03:59.420
news outlets from last September and August from 2016.

72
00:04:00.030 --> 00:04:01.930
And then we just never hear anything about it since then,

73
00:04:01.931 --> 00:04:04.290
nothing from president Obama or president Trump,

74
00:04:04.570 --> 00:04:07.770
it's just the story's just gone, but what did they do with the money? I mean,

75
00:04:07.771 --> 00:04:10.850
six and a half trillion is practically an infinite amount of money.

76
00:04:11.410 --> 00:04:14.730
I guarantee you there's a hidden space program and we're on the moon right now

77
00:04:14.930 --> 00:04:16.730
in this far more to it than we ever thought possible.

78
00:04:17.400 --> 00:04:19.970
Have you ever heard of the H moon theory? Well, it's more,

79
00:04:20.240 --> 00:04:22.960
more than just the theory because the evidence is overwhelming. I mean,

80
00:04:22.961 --> 00:04:26.600
besides the mathematical formulas and equations that are utilized for measuring

81
00:04:26.630 --> 00:04:27.390
mass,

82
00:04:27.390 --> 00:04:30.960
NASA and other scientists have been baffled on why the moon just lacks so much

83
00:04:30.961 --> 00:04:31.241
mass,

84
00:04:31.241 --> 00:04:34.600
that it should have based on all the other calculations that we have about it

85
00:04:34.940 --> 00:04:38.200
yet, when experiments have been done from the seismographs placed from the early

86
00:04:38.201 --> 00:04:42.710
Apollo missions, such as when we threw the Saturn five launch vehicle from the,

87
00:04:43.030 --> 00:04:45.750
uh, Apollo 13 mission, when it crashed into the moon,

88
00:04:46.090 --> 00:04:50.390
it resulted in a impact equivalent to approximately 11 tons of T and T.

89
00:04:50.690 --> 00:04:51.710
And when they did that,

90
00:04:52.050 --> 00:04:56.070
the seismographs bounced with wavelengths for more than three hours in 20

91
00:04:56.071 --> 00:04:56.570
minutes.

92
00:04:56.570 --> 00:05:01.260
And scientists from MIT literally stated that it rang like a bell and their are

93
00:05:01.261 --> 00:05:04.820
completely baffled by it. And the only explanation that they have is that, well,

94
00:05:04.960 --> 00:05:08.900
the moon is hollow, which raises all kinds of other incredible questions.

95
00:05:09.360 --> 00:05:10.420
So take, for example,

96
00:05:10.480 --> 00:05:14.700
the fact that there is an abundance of titanium on the moon, in fact,

97
00:05:14.840 --> 00:05:16.500
concentrations of rocks,

98
00:05:16.860 --> 00:05:20.420
thatta titanium on the moon first earth show that the moon has 10 times as much

99
00:05:20.421 --> 00:05:22.530
titanium than are earth. Hence,

100
00:05:22.531 --> 00:05:24.850
the reason why they're in such a rush to go mine the place,

101
00:05:25.470 --> 00:05:29.850
but there's other questions such as the big mystery on why these massive craters

102
00:05:29.851 --> 00:05:33.610
on the moon are so shallow, like dinner plates, they can't account for it.

103
00:05:33.611 --> 00:05:37.210
They don't know why they're so shallow and that the depth versus with ratio

104
00:05:37.520 --> 00:05:38.970
doesn't add up whatsoever.

105
00:05:40.060 --> 00:05:44.520
Could this give credence that maybe there is titanium sphere on the inside of

106
00:05:44.521 --> 00:05:46.120
the moon? I know that sounds crazy,

107
00:05:46.500 --> 00:05:49.560
but let me show you some more information on that. And by the way,

108
00:05:49.840 --> 00:05:51.360
research the honeymoon theory for yourself,

109
00:05:51.420 --> 00:05:54.520
but you'll notice that the mainstream just ignores it all together and all you

110
00:05:54.521 --> 00:05:58.640
have is fringe media outlets that compare it to being a death star. Seriously,

111
00:05:58.641 --> 00:06:02.760
can't we have an adult conversation and just look at the data and ponder on what

112
00:06:02.761 --> 00:06:04.480
the possibilities are. I mean,

113
00:06:04.481 --> 00:06:08.000
isn't it really interesting that ancient civilizations discuss the time before

114
00:06:08.001 --> 00:06:11.080
the moon, whether it be authors from ancient Greece or Rome,

115
00:06:11.420 --> 00:06:15.800
or even the Zulu tribes in Africa that discuss this in depth or even illusions

116
00:06:15.801 --> 00:06:18.830
to the time of, or the moon mentioned in the Hebrew Bible. In fact,

117
00:06:18.831 --> 00:06:22.870
these legends even go all the way over to south America from native tribes,

118
00:06:22.871 --> 00:06:25.070
from the mountains of Columbia. I mean,

119
00:06:25.071 --> 00:06:27.590
we can't just dismiss verbal legends altogether. I mean,

120
00:06:27.600 --> 00:06:29.790
after all hundreds of civilizations,

121
00:06:29.791 --> 00:06:33.950
across five continents around the world ended up being right about the stories

122
00:06:34.310 --> 00:06:38.180
and legends of a great flood, cuz it's been scientific. We verified that yes,

123
00:06:38.181 --> 00:06:40.140
approximately 13,000 years ago,

124
00:06:40.270 --> 00:06:43.700
there was a sudden and rapid 400 foot rise in global sea levels.

125
00:06:44.040 --> 00:06:46.620
And those legends survived more than 12,000 years.

126
00:06:46.920 --> 00:06:49.660
So is it possible that these legends may be true in that? Well,

127
00:06:49.661 --> 00:06:52.660
maybe the moon was brought into orbit around the earth far,

128
00:06:52.661 --> 00:06:56.340
sooner than we ever thought possible. And everything is just lined up.

129
00:06:56.341 --> 00:07:00.690
Just perfectly allow for an abundance of life to essentially flourish here on

130
00:07:00.691 --> 00:07:01.730
earth. I mean,

131
00:07:01.731 --> 00:07:05.250
it's also worth mentioning that our moon is so unique and of itself that it's

132
00:07:05.251 --> 00:07:09.090
the only moon in our solar system or even in the observable universe for that

133
00:07:09.091 --> 00:07:11.930
matter. That has a nearly perfect circular orbit.

134
00:07:12.160 --> 00:07:16.010
It's technically still elliptical. However, there's no other, uh,

135
00:07:16.011 --> 00:07:19.320
moon that orbits it's planet that we have seen like ours does.

136
00:07:19.820 --> 00:07:23.560
Now let me dump some coincidences on you. Take the ratio 1 0 8.

137
00:07:23.780 --> 00:07:27.720
If you divide the distance from the earth to the sun and divide it by the sun's

138
00:07:27.880 --> 00:07:29.040
diameter, you get 1 0 8.

139
00:07:29.110 --> 00:07:32.480
Well the same thing with the moon divide the distance from the moon by its

140
00:07:32.600 --> 00:07:34.120
diameter. And you also get 1 0 8,

141
00:07:34.290 --> 00:07:38.480
which is interesting because 1 0 8 is mentioned in ancient civilizations. What,

142
00:07:38.550 --> 00:07:43.190
whether it be the 108 towers in Cambodia or the significance of 1 0 8 in the

143
00:07:43.191 --> 00:07:48.190
Hindu religion or even 1 0 8 that might have some similarities to the Stonehenge

144
00:07:48.390 --> 00:07:52.030
monuments with the outer perimeter equaling, uh, 100.8 feet.

145
00:07:52.290 --> 00:07:56.030
And all of these things allow for a near perfect solar eclipse while perfect to

146
00:07:56.031 --> 00:08:00.220
within 99.9%. But the coincidence says don't stop there.

147
00:08:00.680 --> 00:08:01.101
In fact,

148
00:08:01.101 --> 00:08:04.940
the sun and moon appear the same size in the sky because the sun's diameter is

149
00:08:04.941 --> 00:08:09.300
about 400 times greater, but the sun is also 400 times further away,

150
00:08:09.560 --> 00:08:10.460
but not only that,

151
00:08:10.600 --> 00:08:15.580
the earth rotates at a speed 400 times faster than the moon and another number

152
00:08:17.300 --> 00:08:20.650
366, the earth spins 366 during one year.

153
00:08:21.950 --> 00:08:26.010
And the polar circumference of the earth is 360 times bigger than that,

154
00:08:26.011 --> 00:08:28.810
of the moon for the sake of brevity, I'll stop there.

155
00:08:28.870 --> 00:08:32.050
But the coincidences don't just stop there. It's unbelievable.

156
00:08:32.051 --> 00:08:35.010
Just how perfect everything is between the earth and the moon,

157
00:08:35.300 --> 00:08:36.650
these perfect alignments,

158
00:08:36.910 --> 00:08:40.880
the mass of the moon and its perfect orbit and distance from earth have allowed

159
00:08:40.881 --> 00:08:43.800
for incredible amounts of life for the tides, for the seasons.

160
00:08:44.100 --> 00:08:46.640
And although I'm not saying that the earth would look anything like these other

161
00:08:46.641 --> 00:08:48.280
places we've landed on without the moon,

162
00:08:48.740 --> 00:08:52.360
it sure is interesting on how grateful we should be for well, whatever,

163
00:08:52.361 --> 00:08:54.560
put the moon in its place when and where it did,

164
00:08:54.740 --> 00:08:56.880
but there's other outstanding questions about the moon,

165
00:08:57.150 --> 00:08:59.840
such as the Apollo 10 mission where they did, they practiced run,

166
00:08:59.841 --> 00:09:03.800
where they did a lap around the moon prior to the Apollo 11 mission where the

167
00:09:03.801 --> 00:09:07.280
astronauts overheard what they described as music, there was a rhythm,

168
00:09:07.620 --> 00:09:09.440
it was incredible, like nothing they've ever heard.

169
00:09:09.740 --> 00:09:12.840
And they spent the better part of an hour while on the far side of the moon

170
00:09:13.250 --> 00:09:16.110
discussing this and that they heard it while they were on the far side of the

171
00:09:16.111 --> 00:09:18.270
moon. So it couldn't have been anything coming from planet earth.

172
00:09:18.690 --> 00:09:21.150
And although I'm not suggesting that it's aliens on the moon,

173
00:09:21.151 --> 00:09:21.984
listening to music,

174
00:09:22.570 --> 00:09:25.310
all they know is that the astronauts were freaked out about it and they spent

175
00:09:25.311 --> 00:09:28.230
the better part of an hour discussing and whether they would even share that

176
00:09:28.231 --> 00:09:31.590
with NASA, for fear of what it would do to their careers. And you know,

177
00:09:31.591 --> 00:09:34.830
what NASA did, they kept this story secret for nearly 50 years.

178
00:09:35.640 --> 00:09:39.500
That's kind of a red flag to me and to throw even greater mystery into the moon.

179
00:09:39.680 --> 00:09:43.660
Are you familiar with what's called lunar transient phenomena where dating back

180
00:09:43.661 --> 00:09:44.660
to the 11 hundreds.

181
00:09:44.661 --> 00:09:48.180
There's been several notable occasions where people on earth have observed

182
00:09:48.530 --> 00:09:51.580
glowing lights and Fluor fluorescent lighting on the moon.

183
00:09:52.210 --> 00:09:55.180
Many of which cannot be explained through meteorites, which would, you know,

184
00:09:55.181 --> 00:09:57.610
maybe be a flashlight or even volcanic activity,

185
00:09:57.611 --> 00:10:00.810
which would be sustained glowing red, uh, you know, lighting,

186
00:10:00.811 --> 00:10:02.330
which has been observed, which some,

187
00:10:02.331 --> 00:10:05.650
which has never been proved to be volcanic activity by the way, but take,

188
00:10:05.651 --> 00:10:09.210
for example, the Apollo 11 mission buzz Alder and Neil Armstrong,

189
00:10:09.211 --> 00:10:11.890
they're on the way to the moon, just hours from stepping foot on it.

190
00:10:11.891 --> 00:10:15.530
People back on the earth are planting their barbecues. Meanwhile,

191
00:10:15.810 --> 00:10:18.840
NASA calls to Apollo 11 to say that through their telescopes,

192
00:10:18.960 --> 00:10:22.200
he observed some sort of glowing greenish light on the north side of the moon

193
00:10:22.670 --> 00:10:25.160
immediately, Michael col Collins radios back,

194
00:10:25.340 --> 00:10:26.680
and they were observing it as well.

195
00:10:26.780 --> 00:10:29.880
And these described it as a slight flu fluorescent lighting.

196
00:10:30.180 --> 00:10:32.040
And then this story was just never heard from again,

197
00:10:32.470 --> 00:10:34.440
they didn't make it classified. It's not secret,

198
00:10:34.620 --> 00:10:37.510
but you would expect that to be a headline of some sort. I mean,

199
00:10:37.511 --> 00:10:40.670
think about this just hours from stepping foot on the moon for the first time,

200
00:10:40.700 --> 00:10:44.070
there's only been several notable occasions of these lights ever being seen.

201
00:10:44.370 --> 00:10:47.070
And it just so happens from the first time we're ever gonna step foot on the

202
00:10:47.071 --> 00:10:49.110
moon. This is observed by NASA,

203
00:10:49.380 --> 00:10:52.510
from earth as well as the astronauts and that are about to land there.

204
00:10:52.730 --> 00:10:56.110
And the story just gets, you know, omitted from the headlines altogether.

205
00:10:56.600 --> 00:10:57.660
Isn't interesting.

206
00:10:58.430 --> 00:11:02.100
Maybe we should go back to the moon and look at these places where these lights

207
00:11:02.101 --> 00:11:02.934
have been seen from.

208
00:11:03.030 --> 00:11:05.460
Maybe we should go back to the moon and figure out why the moon, uh,

209
00:11:05.461 --> 00:11:09.700
craters are so shallow or why there's processed metals or uranium 2 36,

210
00:11:09.900 --> 00:11:12.660
and neptunium 2 37. Add all these things together, guys.

211
00:11:12.860 --> 00:11:16.220
So you get some really interesting conclusions. Anyways guys,

212
00:11:16.570 --> 00:11:18.930
it's time we start asking serious questions about the moon.

213
00:11:19.370 --> 00:11:21.170
It's time we start entertaining the fact that, you know,

214
00:11:21.180 --> 00:11:25.890
maybe it was geo engineered by some advanced race who knows how long ago?

215
00:11:25.970 --> 00:11:27.170
I mean, I know this sounds crazy,

216
00:11:27.350 --> 00:11:31.130
but when you could take into consideration all the impossible coincidences,

217
00:11:31.440 --> 00:11:33.090
well, I mean maybe it's not impossible,

218
00:11:33.350 --> 00:11:37.010
but do you think it's just a coincidence? I sure don't anyways, guys,

219
00:11:37.011 --> 00:11:39.280
I'll leave it at that. Like it's subscribe. Leave me a comment.

220
00:11:39.340 --> 00:11:40.480
Let me know what your thoughts are.

221
00:11:40.780 --> 00:11:44.360
And I have many other videos to come a whole wide variety of topics. I'm Jimmy,

222
00:11:44.361 --> 00:11:46.480
this is bright insight. Take care, everybody.
