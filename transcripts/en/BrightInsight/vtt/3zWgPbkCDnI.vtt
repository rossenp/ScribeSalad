00:00:00.450 --> 00:00:04.140
<v 0>The evidence is overwhelming that what we were taught in school about ancient</v>

2
00:00:04.141 --> 00:00:05.430
human civilization,

3
00:00:05.490 --> 00:00:10.260
particularly about the ancient Egyptians is far from accurate specifically that

4
00:00:10.440 --> 00:00:15.060
our true history was once far older and advanced than we ever thought possible.

5
00:00:15.330 --> 00:00:18.960
And the most recent scientific evidence further demonstrates that the great

6
00:00:18.961 --> 00:00:22.800
pyramid of Giza Egypt was not a tomb built for the pharaohs,

7
00:00:23.040 --> 00:00:27.240
but as literally a massive technological structure that is beyond our current

8
00:00:27.241 --> 00:00:28.080
understanding,

9
00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:32.070
you may have seen the news articles that reported on a recent study published in

10
00:00:32.071 --> 00:00:33.840
the journal of applied physics,

11
00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:38.340
which was conducted by researchers and physicists from Germany and Russia,

12
00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:41.730
which provided scientific data based on calculations,

13
00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:46.350
which showed that the great pyramid can concentrate electromagnetic energy

14
00:00:46.650 --> 00:00:48.540
inside of its internal chambers,

15
00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:53.400
as well as under its base and inside the subterranean chamber. Now,

16
00:00:53.401 --> 00:00:57.660
the significance of this discovery can not be overstated because we now have

17
00:00:57.661 --> 00:01:02.160
scientific data which supports the theory that the great pyramid of Giza was in

18
00:01:02.161 --> 00:01:04.590
fact, a technological structure of some kind.

19
00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:08.340
And I discussed this in detail last year in a video I made where I combined

20
00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:12.270
Nikola Tesla's concept for harnessing wireless energy out of the earth.

21
00:01:12.660 --> 00:01:15.300
And I make the case that the great pyramid may have been a structure for

22
00:01:15.301 --> 00:01:19.770
generating power. A theory that has been proposed for decades by researchers,

23
00:01:19.771 --> 00:01:22.230
such as Christopher Dunn and others,

24
00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:26.370
but with the recent discovery involving the great pyramid of Giza is ability to

25
00:01:26.371 --> 00:01:28.740
concentrate and focus energy.

26
00:01:29.190 --> 00:01:33.540
We have to start asking serious questions as to what this massive and mysterious

27
00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:38.850
structures purpose actually was because listen to this included in the

28
00:01:38.851 --> 00:01:42.510
study, the physicist stated that due to the data they obtained,

29
00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:47.160
they want to replicate the results on a nanoscale and design pyramid of

30
00:01:47.190 --> 00:01:52.110
nanoparticles that could be employed in futuristic nanosensors and

31
00:01:52.111 --> 00:01:56.310
improved solar cells. In other words, because of this discovery,

32
00:01:56.311 --> 00:01:58.710
which was based off calculations of the pyramid,

33
00:01:58.980 --> 00:02:03.030
which included the size and dimensions of the overall structure and the shape

34
00:02:03.031 --> 00:02:04.950
and dimensions of the internal chambers,

35
00:02:05.310 --> 00:02:09.600
we are able to advance nanosensor technology, which wow,

36
00:02:09.601 --> 00:02:13.890
if you think about it, we use sensors in so many things. Now our cell phones,

37
00:02:13.891 --> 00:02:18.450
automatic doors, automatic lights, anti-collision sensors on car bumpers.

38
00:02:18.990 --> 00:02:21.480
And the examples really are endless. I mean,

39
00:02:21.900 --> 00:02:25.920
they are used for measuring light pressure sound, temperature, humidity.

40
00:02:26.340 --> 00:02:30.180
It's crazy at how many different things we use sensors for and never really

41
00:02:30.181 --> 00:02:33.270
think about it, but not just developing better.

42
00:02:33.271 --> 00:02:37.800
Nanosensors we're now also able to develop more efficient solar

43
00:02:37.801 --> 00:02:42.390
panels because of this discovery stop and think about how big of a deal this

44
00:02:42.391 --> 00:02:43.830
discovery really is.

45
00:02:44.400 --> 00:02:49.080
And to clarify the data obtained that we can use to develop the solar cells and

46
00:02:49.081 --> 00:02:53.700
sensors is not suggesting that the pyramid chambers were sir some type of

47
00:02:53.701 --> 00:02:57.690
sensor or solar cell of any kind, but the great pyramid actually is,

48
00:02:57.691 --> 00:03:02.080
or was we still do not know, but with all of this said,

49
00:03:02.440 --> 00:03:07.270
we do know that the great pyramid of Giza is somehow able to focus and

50
00:03:07.271 --> 00:03:11.620
harness energy. And according to the so-called experts,

51
00:03:12.040 --> 00:03:16.690
this must all be just a coincidence because how could the ancients have had this

52
00:03:16.691 --> 00:03:20.830
type of knowledge, which somehow exceeds our own, at least in some ways,

53
00:03:21.130 --> 00:03:24.190
but wait a second, just a coincidence, really.

54
00:03:24.700 --> 00:03:28.930
So it just so happens that the largest and most mysterious structure ever built

55
00:03:29.350 --> 00:03:33.730
done with extreme precision, which mimics modern day laser cut technology,

56
00:03:33.910 --> 00:03:37.030
you can't even fit a razorblade between the stone blocks that make up the

57
00:03:37.031 --> 00:03:37.864
pyramid,

58
00:03:37.990 --> 00:03:42.130
look at this photo as an example of a shaft within the so-called King's chamber.

59
00:03:42.131 --> 00:03:43.150
And this is a granite.

60
00:03:43.810 --> 00:03:47.680
These stones were cut so precisely that they fit together with watertight

61
00:03:47.710 --> 00:03:52.450
accuracy and it extends for hundreds of feet and an unknown amount of stone

62
00:03:52.451 --> 00:03:56.560
blocks. And they say that they did this with chisels and bronze saws.

63
00:03:56.561 --> 00:04:00.880
Like no, those proposed methods have long been since debunked.

64
00:04:00.910 --> 00:04:04.840
And I've shared this in detail in other videos, but furthermore,

65
00:04:04.900 --> 00:04:09.340
the size and shape of the tunnels and chambers inside of the pyramid,

66
00:04:09.341 --> 00:04:10.480
which by the way,

67
00:04:10.840 --> 00:04:14.890
bear zero resemblance to an Egyptian tomb as I'll be discussing later in this

68
00:04:14.891 --> 00:04:15.311
video.

69
00:04:15.311 --> 00:04:20.200
But it just so happens that they are able to focus and concentrate

70
00:04:20.201 --> 00:04:21.820
in electromagnetic energy,

71
00:04:22.120 --> 00:04:25.810
which they are saying is going to help us advance our modern technology.

72
00:04:26.170 --> 00:04:28.420
And it's all just a coincidence.

73
00:04:28.480 --> 00:04:33.400
The ancients must have randomly chosen the specific design and size

74
00:04:33.430 --> 00:04:36.880
of the pyramid and its chambers. Uh, yeah,

75
00:04:36.910 --> 00:04:39.550
I really don't think that this is a coincidence whatsoever,

76
00:04:39.580 --> 00:04:43.240
especially when you combine other fascinating details about the great pyramid,

77
00:04:43.420 --> 00:04:46.630
a few of which I've shared in other videos, which I have to share again,

78
00:04:46.631 --> 00:04:50.290
because these details can not be left out of this video. For example,

79
00:04:50.291 --> 00:04:54.220
did you know that the location of the great pyramid of Giza Egypt just so

80
00:04:54.221 --> 00:04:58.060
happens to be the location that they were going to choose to be the prime

81
00:04:58.061 --> 00:04:58.894
Meridian?

82
00:04:59.260 --> 00:05:03.610
This is because of its proximity to the geographical center of earth landmass.

83
00:05:04.180 --> 00:05:08.200
It's the one spot on land where you pass over more land than any other.

84
00:05:08.740 --> 00:05:12.010
And they ended up choosing Greenwich England to be the prime Meridian because of

85
00:05:12.011 --> 00:05:16.090
the fact that London's busy shipping lanes in English channel are actually the

86
00:05:16.091 --> 00:05:19.090
busiest on earth and to reduce time zone confusion,

87
00:05:19.390 --> 00:05:23.020
they chose not to go with Giza. Think about this for a moment.

88
00:05:23.140 --> 00:05:25.720
The most mysterious structure in the history of mankind,

89
00:05:25.750 --> 00:05:29.620
just so happens to be located on this one unique spot.

90
00:05:29.950 --> 00:05:32.320
And here's another fact to add on top of that,

91
00:05:32.650 --> 00:05:36.640
the great pyramid faces true north almost perfectly. In fact,

92
00:05:36.850 --> 00:05:40.120
down to a fraction of one degree of accuracy.

93
00:05:40.480 --> 00:05:44.140
What makes this particularly incredible is that there was no north star in the

94
00:05:44.141 --> 00:05:48.850
sky to use this orientation in the third millennium BC when the pyramids of Giza

95
00:05:48.851 --> 00:05:50.170
are said to have been built,

96
00:05:50.620 --> 00:05:54.610
and this of course is due to the Earth's tilt and procession of the Equinox.

97
00:05:55.450 --> 00:05:57.010
So the question becomes,

98
00:05:57.230 --> 00:06:00.590
how were they able to identify true north so precisely,

99
00:06:00.920 --> 00:06:05.420
and not only that create a structure so large that aligns so accurately to it.

100
00:06:05.780 --> 00:06:09.800
And let's not forget that it is made up of approximately two and a half million

101
00:06:09.830 --> 00:06:13.850
multi-tone stone blocks, some of which exceed 70 tons,

102
00:06:14.390 --> 00:06:19.010
and it is nearly 500 feet tall and over 750 feet wide at its

103
00:06:19.011 --> 00:06:22.400
base. And you can see the metric conversion here in this image,

104
00:06:22.940 --> 00:06:26.840
whoever designed this did not just randomly choose these insanely large

105
00:06:26.870 --> 00:06:30.290
measurements and they didn't just do it because they could do it.

106
00:06:30.710 --> 00:06:34.550
They chose the specifics during the planning and did so for a reason.

107
00:06:34.760 --> 00:06:37.820
And the size is not the only amazing thing about it.

108
00:06:38.030 --> 00:06:42.620
The mathematical formulas and equations necessary to accurately piece together,

109
00:06:42.860 --> 00:06:45.110
millions of stone blocks is astonishing,

110
00:06:45.290 --> 00:06:48.350
especially when you consider it's complicated internal layout.

111
00:06:48.830 --> 00:06:53.210
And this brings us back to the incredible discovery that this study revealed the

112
00:06:53.240 --> 00:06:57.740
coincidental or accidental fact that the pyramid concentrate electromagnetic

113
00:06:57.770 --> 00:07:00.890
energy inside of its chambers and at its base.

114
00:07:01.700 --> 00:07:04.640
So pair the various details. I just shared about it,

115
00:07:04.641 --> 00:07:09.410
including its coincidental proximity to the earth center of landmass,

116
00:07:09.890 --> 00:07:14.540
consider for a moment Nikola Tesla's concept for utilizing the world as a dynamo

117
00:07:14.541 --> 00:07:16.730
and harnessing wireless energy out of it,

118
00:07:17.510 --> 00:07:22.310
is it possible that the great pyramid of Giza was a power plant that somehow

119
00:07:22.340 --> 00:07:25.670
operated on the same premise that Nikola Tesla had theorized.

120
00:07:26.360 --> 00:07:29.360
And I think that the recent discovery regarding the pyramids ability to

121
00:07:29.361 --> 00:07:34.100
concentrate energy for the supports this prospect, and of course,

122
00:07:34.130 --> 00:07:36.410
you know, that may not be the case at all,

123
00:07:36.440 --> 00:07:41.120
but it's worth mentioning that Nikola Tesla chose to build the Tesla tower above

124
00:07:41.240 --> 00:07:42.560
an underground aquifer.

125
00:07:43.100 --> 00:07:46.670
And most people do not know that there is an ancient aquifer actually underneath

126
00:07:46.671 --> 00:07:50.780
the Giza pyramids, a massive network of caves, tunnels and chambers.

127
00:07:51.350 --> 00:07:54.620
And this was reported by NBC news back in 2009.

128
00:07:54.650 --> 00:07:57.620
And the article discussed the existence of these caves,

129
00:07:57.830 --> 00:08:02.450
even pointing out how British consul general Henry salt investigated these caves

130
00:08:02.451 --> 00:08:07.400
with Italian Explorer, Giovanni, [inaudible] all the way back in 1817.

131
00:08:07.940 --> 00:08:12.080
All the evidence shows that this cave system exists and it's even cooperated by

132
00:08:12.110 --> 00:08:13.190
ancient funerary texts,

133
00:08:13.191 --> 00:08:17.510
which clearly allude to the existence of a subterranean world in the vicinity of

134
00:08:17.511 --> 00:08:18.530
the Giza pyramids.

135
00:08:18.950 --> 00:08:22.880
And you can take the ancient Egyptian book of the dead as an example.

136
00:08:23.810 --> 00:08:28.220
So the article goes on to discuss how Zahid [inaudible] the former minister of

137
00:08:28.221 --> 00:08:31.790
antiquities of Egypt, which have of course discussed in several other videos,

138
00:08:31.791 --> 00:08:36.380
but he completely dismissed that discovery stating. And I quote,

139
00:08:36.860 --> 00:08:39.650
there are no new discoveries to be made at Giza.

140
00:08:39.710 --> 00:08:44.390
We know everything about the plateau, um, what in,

141
00:08:44.391 --> 00:08:45.260
believe it or not.

142
00:08:45.320 --> 00:08:49.400
That is the last time the public ever heard about this network of caves and

143
00:08:49.401 --> 00:08:53.030
tunnels and chambers underneath the Giza plateau. For some reason,

144
00:08:53.060 --> 00:08:57.420
there is not one single record of caves documented within Egypt and

145
00:08:57.421 --> 00:09:00.780
antiquities. At least that's available to the public.

146
00:09:01.560 --> 00:09:05.760
Also keep in mind that this is the same guy who slammed the 2017

147
00:09:05.761 --> 00:09:10.620
discovery of a massive chamber or void within the great pyramid and is

148
00:09:10.621 --> 00:09:15.090
literally attempting to delay excavation of it for years. No joke.

149
00:09:15.990 --> 00:09:19.410
Now combine that with the fact that about 20 years ago,

150
00:09:19.680 --> 00:09:24.360
ground penetrating radar confirmed that a chamber exists underneath the Sphinx,

151
00:09:24.840 --> 00:09:29.820
approximately 30 feet down and is estimated to be 26 feet wide and 40

152
00:09:29.821 --> 00:09:32.790
feet in length. This is documented yet.

153
00:09:32.791 --> 00:09:36.930
Most people are not aware of this and the Egyptian authorities will not permit

154
00:09:36.960 --> 00:09:38.400
any type of excavation.

155
00:09:38.850 --> 00:09:42.180
They will not allow researchers to do anything or see anything.

156
00:09:42.480 --> 00:09:45.810
They're not even permitted to drill a small hole to lower a camera.

157
00:09:46.200 --> 00:09:49.350
These are just a few examples. There are others worthy of mention,

158
00:09:49.351 --> 00:09:53.100
but I'm pointing all of this out to show you guys that there is other

159
00:09:53.101 --> 00:09:57.540
information that exists related to our ancient history that is not available to

160
00:09:57.541 --> 00:09:58.530
the general public.

161
00:09:58.740 --> 00:10:02.190
And one of the big problems is that the general public is well completely

162
00:10:02.191 --> 00:10:05.220
oblivious to this fact because they wouldn't know these things unless they

163
00:10:05.221 --> 00:10:08.160
researched it on their own because after all they don't teach this stuff in

164
00:10:08.161 --> 00:10:08.994
school.

165
00:10:09.060 --> 00:10:13.230
And the largest media outlets on planet earth seem to dismiss or omit this

166
00:10:13.231 --> 00:10:14.640
information altogether.

167
00:10:14.910 --> 00:10:18.870
And the recent discovery of the electromagnetic energy within the great pyramid

168
00:10:18.871 --> 00:10:23.070
is an outstanding example of this point. Wait till you see this.

169
00:10:23.100 --> 00:10:25.500
So while I was researching this topic,

170
00:10:25.530 --> 00:10:30.180
I saw several dozen media outlets from around the world that covered this story.

171
00:10:30.660 --> 00:10:34.980
Yet you may be curious to know which news outlets did not cover this story.

172
00:10:35.310 --> 00:10:39.210
Despite the fact that they report on stories related to the ancient Egyptians on

173
00:10:39.211 --> 00:10:40.410
a regular basis,

174
00:10:40.980 --> 00:10:44.490
even look at the most recent example involving the discovered black granite

175
00:10:44.491 --> 00:10:47.370
sarcophagus found in Alexandria Egypt.

176
00:10:47.610 --> 00:10:51.330
So now I'm going to show you all the media outlets that covered on the black

177
00:10:51.331 --> 00:10:52.410
granite sarcophagus,

178
00:10:52.680 --> 00:10:56.340
but did not cover on the recent discovery involving the electromagnetic

179
00:10:56.341 --> 00:11:01.290
properties inside the great pyramid CNN Fox news,

180
00:11:01.650 --> 00:11:04.350
CBS, ABC,

181
00:11:05.040 --> 00:11:09.840
BBC time magazine business insider

182
00:11:10.170 --> 00:11:15.060
the New York times, the Washington post, the Washington times,

183
00:11:15.480 --> 00:11:17.730
NPR Reuters,

184
00:11:18.270 --> 00:11:22.470
national geographic scientific American and the

185
00:11:22.471 --> 00:11:27.330
Smithsonian. So these outlets frequently covered news related to ancient Egypt.

186
00:11:27.360 --> 00:11:31.170
Yet they chose to skip this recent discovery completely.

187
00:11:31.410 --> 00:11:36.030
Am I the only one that finds that odd evidence that shows that maybe the ancient

188
00:11:36.031 --> 00:11:38.580
Egyptians were more advanced than we ever thought possible.

189
00:11:38.581 --> 00:11:41.130
And they just ignore the story altogether. I mean,

190
00:11:41.131 --> 00:11:45.780
we're now able to develop better nanosensors and solar panels because of this

191
00:11:45.781 --> 00:11:49.230
discovery and they don't even share it. And by the way,

192
00:11:49.260 --> 00:11:52.740
the articles that did cover it, throw in outdated information,

193
00:11:52.990 --> 00:11:55.870
such as suggesting that it was built by slaves,

194
00:11:55.871 --> 00:11:59.620
which it's embarrassing that the New York post printed that the slave theory has

195
00:11:59.621 --> 00:12:03.940
long been since debunked and even Zahi [inaudible] denies it. And of course,

196
00:12:03.941 --> 00:12:07.120
the articles also state that the pyramids were built to be tombs for the

197
00:12:07.630 --> 00:12:07.631
pharaohs.

198
00:12:07.631 --> 00:12:12.430
But it's funny how they never mentioned that not one single mummy was ever

199
00:12:12.431 --> 00:12:17.140
found in any of these pyramids ever that's right. And a true story.

200
00:12:17.141 --> 00:12:19.630
They don't even mention that in school for some reason,

201
00:12:19.990 --> 00:12:23.980
but research it for yourself. No mummy was ever found in the pyramids.

202
00:12:24.190 --> 00:12:26.920
So when they call it the King's chamber, no,

203
00:12:26.950 --> 00:12:31.660
no king mummy was ever found when they call it the Queens chamber. Nope,

204
00:12:31.720 --> 00:12:34.150
no queen mummy was ever found there either.

205
00:12:34.570 --> 00:12:39.040
You should also know that there are zero hieroglyphs or petroglyphs of any kind

206
00:12:39.130 --> 00:12:43.750
in any of the pyramids, which is odd because confirmed Egyptian tombs,

207
00:12:43.751 --> 00:12:47.290
such as at the valley of the Kings. Well, just look for yourself,

208
00:12:47.590 --> 00:12:49.420
look at the amazing artwork.

209
00:12:49.540 --> 00:12:54.250
This is what confirmed Egyptian tombs actually look like. And it makes sense.

210
00:12:54.550 --> 00:12:58.330
So compare that again to the bare walls within the pyramids.

211
00:12:58.600 --> 00:13:02.350
And it's also worth mentioning that despite the tens of thousands of hieroglyphs

212
00:13:02.351 --> 00:13:04.150
and petroglyphs found throughout Egypt,

213
00:13:04.480 --> 00:13:09.340
not one single one of them depict anything about the pyramids or

214
00:13:09.341 --> 00:13:11.410
the Spinks, literally nothing,

215
00:13:11.590 --> 00:13:15.250
which is of course why we have no idea how they constructed the pyramids.

216
00:13:15.280 --> 00:13:19.210
But you may remember the clickbait articles from over a year ago,

217
00:13:19.211 --> 00:13:23.590
which stated that newly discovered ancient pirate scrolls revealed how the

218
00:13:23.591 --> 00:13:27.880
pyramid was built. But if you read the actual details of this discovery,

219
00:13:28.090 --> 00:13:32.200
all the scrolls state is that some limestone blocks removed from across the Nile

220
00:13:32.201 --> 00:13:36.610
river and brought to Giza like, so what's, I mean, this was already known.

221
00:13:36.940 --> 00:13:40.150
The only thing that this discovery suggests is that they repaired the casing

222
00:13:40.151 --> 00:13:43.660
stones following an earthquake, which has long been suggested.

223
00:13:43.660 --> 00:13:47.980
And just like we know that the Egyptians changed the face of the Sphinx. Well,

224
00:13:47.981 --> 00:13:50.230
many are not aware that there is definitive evidence,

225
00:13:50.231 --> 00:13:54.130
that the Egyptians also repaired parts of the body of the Sphinx as well with

226
00:13:54.131 --> 00:13:58.420
limestone blocks and keep in mind that the original Sphinx was carved entirely

227
00:13:58.421 --> 00:13:59.710
out of limestone bedrock.

228
00:13:59.711 --> 00:14:03.820
So all these tiles and blocks that you see are restorations that happened later

229
00:14:03.821 --> 00:14:06.310
in both ancient and modern times,

230
00:14:06.700 --> 00:14:10.750
but discovered papyri scrolls mentioned absolutely nothing about how the pyramid

231
00:14:10.751 --> 00:14:13.570
was constructed. And it only states what we already knew,

232
00:14:13.571 --> 00:14:17.980
which was that stone blocks were taken from quarries and brought to Giza yet

233
00:14:18.430 --> 00:14:21.820
Zaja was referred to this as the greatest discovery in Egypt,

234
00:14:21.850 --> 00:14:23.740
in the 21st century.

235
00:14:24.070 --> 00:14:27.550
But here's the reason why the story fell flat and gained little attention.

236
00:14:27.880 --> 00:14:31.420
And I encourage others to read what the discovery actually found because even

237
00:14:31.421 --> 00:14:36.130
the guy who made the discovery downplayed the significance and countered what he

238
00:14:36.131 --> 00:14:37.330
had actually said about it,

239
00:14:37.990 --> 00:14:40.990
I point this out because every time we make a video on the topic of the pyramids

240
00:14:40.991 --> 00:14:42.280
and how mysterious they are,

241
00:14:42.310 --> 00:14:46.720
I get comments from people that apparently only read the clickbait headlines on

242
00:14:46.721 --> 00:14:51.500
this story and did not actually read the story because many stated in common

243
00:14:51.740 --> 00:14:53.720
set. Well, we've discovered how the pyramids were built.

244
00:14:53.810 --> 00:14:56.690
It's no longer a mystery. The pirate schools revealed it,

245
00:14:57.110 --> 00:15:00.810
which again is literally not true. We do not know what methods were used to cut,

246
00:15:01.280 --> 00:15:04.910
carve, or move these stones into place inside the pyramid. Now,

247
00:15:04.911 --> 00:15:05.721
with all of this said,

248
00:15:05.721 --> 00:15:09.770
I should point out that I am not 100% convinced that the pyramids were power

249
00:15:09.771 --> 00:15:10.910
plants. To me,

250
00:15:10.911 --> 00:15:14.510
it just seems like the most likely possibility for a variety of reasons.

251
00:15:14.990 --> 00:15:17.870
Let's not forget that the largest structures that we make today are for

252
00:15:17.871 --> 00:15:21.590
producing power, such as with hydroelectric dams. Well,

253
00:15:21.710 --> 00:15:25.970
it also just so happens that the Nile river used to be eight miles closer to the

254
00:15:25.971 --> 00:15:28.790
pyramids going right up to the pyramid of Jesus' steps.

255
00:15:28.791 --> 00:15:31.700
And here you can see the existing evidence in the terrain.

256
00:15:31.970 --> 00:15:35.120
This is an important factor when you consider that there are underground caves

257
00:15:35.121 --> 00:15:36.200
below the pyramids.

258
00:15:36.200 --> 00:15:40.730
And especially when you connect the dots on Nikola Tesla and how he chose to put

259
00:15:40.731 --> 00:15:44.240
the Tesla tower above an aquifer. Like I mentioned earlier,

260
00:15:44.660 --> 00:15:48.290
all in attempt to use the earth to generate electricity, but of course,

261
00:15:48.291 --> 00:15:52.580
many people will find the prospect of an ancient civilization before ours being

262
00:15:52.581 --> 00:15:56.960
able to harness electricity as well. A ridiculous theory backed by no evidence.

263
00:15:57.260 --> 00:15:59.840
And it's actually been referred to as pseudoscience as well,

264
00:15:59.841 --> 00:16:03.230
but take a look at this. And this is in Dendera Egypt,

265
00:16:03.260 --> 00:16:08.090
which is referred to as the Dendera light bulb. What exactly is this depicting?

266
00:16:08.660 --> 00:16:11.960
It looks like a light bulb with the snake depicting an electrical current.

267
00:16:11.990 --> 00:16:14.750
And if you look at the Lotus flower on the right,

268
00:16:15.080 --> 00:16:18.680
it's almost as if it's depicting a wire that goes to some type of box.

269
00:16:19.580 --> 00:16:22.970
And when you look at the ball on top of say, this person's head,

270
00:16:23.510 --> 00:16:28.250
could this be symbolic of using the power of the earth and the mind to

271
00:16:28.251 --> 00:16:29.120
create something?

272
00:16:29.750 --> 00:16:32.870
It almost seems like they were depicting that they were combining their mind and

273
00:16:32.871 --> 00:16:36.740
abilities and the earth to create electricity. Now, of course,

274
00:16:36.741 --> 00:16:39.170
this may not be true at all and could be a total stretch.

275
00:16:39.200 --> 00:16:40.850
And obviously many people would doubt it.

276
00:16:41.180 --> 00:16:45.170
But I would be curious to hear what their explanation for it would be either

277
00:16:45.171 --> 00:16:47.180
way, it's a thought provoking discussion,

278
00:16:47.420 --> 00:16:50.660
but pyramid power plant or not mark my words,

279
00:16:50.690 --> 00:16:55.160
the discovery of the electromagnetic properties inside the pyramid is going to

280
00:16:55.640 --> 00:16:59.240
well eventually pave the way for some of the most incredible discoveries in

281
00:16:59.241 --> 00:17:03.980
modern times about our ancient ancestors and that somehow we are once far more

282
00:17:03.981 --> 00:17:05.750
advanced than we ever thought possible.

283
00:17:05.810 --> 00:17:09.890
So the question becomes just how advanced were they and what happened to them.

284
00:17:10.430 --> 00:17:14.210
And other videos have discussed the younger Dryas climate catastrophe of 13,000

285
00:17:14.211 --> 00:17:14.721
years ago.

286
00:17:14.721 --> 00:17:18.590
That essentially it was a total reset here on earth for whatever civilization

287
00:17:18.591 --> 00:17:19.730
was around at that time.

288
00:17:20.150 --> 00:17:23.480
And this actually reminds me of an outstanding quote by Graham Hancock,

289
00:17:23.481 --> 00:17:26.120
which has stated that we are a species with amnesia.

290
00:17:26.660 --> 00:17:31.010
He says that my sense is that we are missing a huge part of the human story.

291
00:17:31.340 --> 00:17:33.860
I think that it's possible indeed, probable,

292
00:17:34.220 --> 00:17:38.330
that we are a species within Nisia that we've lost the record of our story going

293
00:17:38.331 --> 00:17:41.630
back thousands of years before so-called history began.

294
00:17:41.960 --> 00:17:44.180
And I think if we could go back to that dark epoch,

295
00:17:44.510 --> 00:17:48.800
we would discover many astounding things about ourselves. Anyways, guys,

296
00:17:48.801 --> 00:17:49.920
I'm going leave it at that,

297
00:17:49.950 --> 00:17:51.960
but leave a comment and share what your thoughts are.

298
00:17:51.961 --> 00:17:54.840
I look forward to seeing what other people think about this recent discovery,

299
00:17:55.470 --> 00:17:59.100
but I'm Jimmy, this is bright insight, hit the like button and subscribe.

300
00:17:59.130 --> 00:18:02.730
And I have many more videos to come and a whole wide variety of topics take care

301
00:18:02.790 --> 00:18:03.060
of everybody.
