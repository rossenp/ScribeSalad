00:00:01.100 --> 00:00:04.280
<v 0>Hi everybody. I'm Jimmy, and this is bright insight today.</v>

2
00:00:04.281 --> 00:00:08.080
We're gonna do part two of debunking the textbooks in regards to the pyramids of

3
00:00:08.081 --> 00:00:08.914
Egypt.

4
00:00:08.990 --> 00:00:13.640
Does anyone else find it really odd that the textbooks never ever mentioned that

5
00:00:13.641 --> 00:00:18.200
the pyramids of Giza in Egypt just happened to be located at the

6
00:00:18.440 --> 00:00:22.550
geographical center of all land mass of planet earth? That's right.

7
00:00:23.170 --> 00:00:27.470
The EastWest parallel crosses the most land and the north south Meridian that

8
00:00:27.471 --> 00:00:31.310
crosses the most land intersect in two places on planet earth.

9
00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:32.483
One is in the ocean.

10
00:00:33.010 --> 00:00:37.630
The other just happens to be at the location of the great pyramid of Giza.

11
00:00:38.390 --> 00:00:40.950
Uh, so I really doubt that that's a coincidence. Am I the only one,

12
00:00:41.220 --> 00:00:42.420
one that thinks that, I mean, come on.

13
00:00:42.720 --> 00:00:46.100
It just so happens that one of the last surviving ancient wonders of the world,

14
00:00:46.560 --> 00:00:51.340
one of the largest and most mysterious structures ever built just happens to be

15
00:00:51.341 --> 00:00:55.540
located on the one exact spot on planet earth that is completely unique and of

16
00:00:55.541 --> 00:00:56.374
itself.

17
00:00:56.440 --> 00:00:59.180
And it makes you wonder with all the different theories about what the pyramids

18
00:00:59.181 --> 00:01:00.100
were actually used for,

19
00:01:00.101 --> 00:01:04.770
because they weren't tomb anyone with analytical mindset clearly see that they

20
00:01:04.771 --> 00:01:05.371
were not tombs.

21
00:01:05.371 --> 00:01:08.890
Now I'm not saying that the dynastic Egyptians didn't utilize 'em as tombs.

22
00:01:09.040 --> 00:01:12.850
What I am saying is that whatever advanced civilization ruled this earth prior

23
00:01:12.910 --> 00:01:17.010
to the global cataly that happened 12,980 years ago,

24
00:01:17.120 --> 00:01:20.770
give or take five years as verified through core eye samples from Antarctica,

25
00:01:21.070 --> 00:01:25.960
as well as green end. And the second cataly that happened 1400 years later,

26
00:01:25.961 --> 00:01:30.560
approximately 11,600 years ago were total reset bonds on humanity.

27
00:01:30.940 --> 00:01:34.360
I'm going to make a video on the global cataly and all the supporting evidence

28
00:01:34.361 --> 00:01:36.040
of it because it's genuinely conclusive.

29
00:01:36.340 --> 00:01:39.040
And I highly recommend that you look into the works of Graham Hancock,

30
00:01:39.041 --> 00:01:43.790
Randall Carlson, John Anthony, west, Robert shock, Brian Forrester,

31
00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:48.710
and many others because together their works clearly show overwhelming evidence

32
00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:49.950
that that actually happened.

33
00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:54.510
And clearly that if mankind had advanced civilization at that time as verified

34
00:01:54.530 --> 00:01:56.190
by go Beckley Tepe in Turkey,

35
00:01:56.570 --> 00:01:59.910
you can clearly see that there's so much more to that history of ancient

36
00:01:59.911 --> 00:02:02.910
civilization that we were ever told in school. And, you know,

37
00:02:03.140 --> 00:02:06.500
I also find it really interesting that the textbooks failed to mention the

38
00:02:06.501 --> 00:02:10.780
massive tunnel system located in and under the Giza plateau surrounding the

39
00:02:10.781 --> 00:02:13.060
pyramids. Now, most people are familiar that yes,

40
00:02:13.070 --> 00:02:14.940
there were tunnels built underneath the pyramid,

41
00:02:15.800 --> 00:02:19.900
but most people aren't aware that that was dug over three stories down into

42
00:02:19.901 --> 00:02:22.980
solid bedrock. Now, just to clarify, when I say solid bedrock,

43
00:02:22.981 --> 00:02:24.930
it is line limestone bedrock,

44
00:02:24.931 --> 00:02:27.450
which is a four outta 10 on the most scale of hardness. So yes,

45
00:02:27.640 --> 00:02:32.010
that could be dug out with pickaxes, but it would be overwhelmingly difficult.

46
00:02:32.110 --> 00:02:33.810
Now I'm not saying it didn't happen by people.

47
00:02:33.910 --> 00:02:36.010
I'm not saying that that wasn't dug out. However,

48
00:02:36.200 --> 00:02:39.810
it's particularly interesting how there's very little information out there

49
00:02:39.860 --> 00:02:43.410
about the massive tunnel system or these incredibly deep shafts,

50
00:02:43.411 --> 00:02:47.240
seemingly random dozens of them located throughout the Giza plateau.

51
00:02:47.500 --> 00:02:50.160
And they range from anywhere from 60 to a hundred feet deep,

52
00:02:50.540 --> 00:02:53.840
but their actual debts are still unknown because they're covered with thousands

53
00:02:53.841 --> 00:02:56.600
of years of sand that have poured into them. I mean, look,

54
00:02:56.601 --> 00:03:00.960
these were perfectly symmetrical squares ranging from 10 by 10 and in some

55
00:03:00.961 --> 00:03:05.560
cases, 15 by 15, and they were cut perfectly out of solid limestone bedrock.

56
00:03:05.780 --> 00:03:07.840
Now the precision of all that is very interesting,

57
00:03:07.900 --> 00:03:11.280
but what's even more interesting is that these vertical shafts also connect to

58
00:03:11.281 --> 00:03:14.480
horizontal shafts that run randomly throughout the Giza plateau.

59
00:03:14.750 --> 00:03:17.840
Many of which are allegedly not explored and they don't know what's in 'em,

60
00:03:17.900 --> 00:03:19.870
but yet closed and blocked off to the public.

61
00:03:19.970 --> 00:03:22.710
As you can see from all these cages located throughout. Now,

62
00:03:22.711 --> 00:03:25.990
let me mention that all of these pictures that you see on this video are from

63
00:03:26.050 --> 00:03:29.750
Google images. However, most of them originate from Brian Forrester,

64
00:03:29.840 --> 00:03:33.950
check him out on YouTube, check out his website, hidden anchor tours, dot com.

65
00:03:34.310 --> 00:03:36.870
I can't wait to go on a tour with him one day once I have the money,

66
00:03:37.450 --> 00:03:41.140
but literally these are things that you would never know if you didn't actually

67
00:03:41.280 --> 00:03:44.940
see his essentially homemade videos where he takes you and walks you around the

68
00:03:44.941 --> 00:03:45.774
Giza plateau,

69
00:03:45.960 --> 00:03:49.140
and you see all these random shafts that just plummet straight into the earth.

70
00:03:49.520 --> 00:03:52.620
Now, what were these tunnels used for? I have no idea. Maybe just,

71
00:03:52.621 --> 00:03:56.220
maybe these were utilized to move water as in support of some sort of power

72
00:03:56.240 --> 00:03:59.220
system. I have no idea. Maybe the pyramids were not a power system.

73
00:03:59.560 --> 00:04:02.810
What I do know is that whatever their original purpose was was far more

74
00:04:02.811 --> 00:04:05.450
sophisticated than just a tomb, something else.

75
00:04:05.451 --> 00:04:08.610
That's very interesting that you hardly hear anything about and is certainly not

76
00:04:08.611 --> 00:04:09.690
mentioned in the textbooks,

77
00:04:10.070 --> 00:04:14.770
is that there was never any sot found in these pyramids. That's right now, take,

78
00:04:14.771 --> 00:04:17.090
for example, the picture on the left that's of the cystine chapel,

79
00:04:17.480 --> 00:04:21.640
most people are completely unaware that it took ye years of restoration in order

80
00:04:21.641 --> 00:04:25.960
to remove the incredible amount of sot that accumulated from centuries of

81
00:04:25.961 --> 00:04:28.680
candles and torches that were utilized to illuminate the structure.

82
00:04:28.750 --> 00:04:30.440
Obviously before there was light bulbs.

83
00:04:30.860 --> 00:04:35.840
Now take this picture from Egypt that seemed to show some sort of symbolism

84
00:04:36.300 --> 00:04:37.920
for, I would say electricity.

85
00:04:37.960 --> 00:04:41.830
Couldn't you argue that that snake is symbol of an electrical current,

86
00:04:42.410 --> 00:04:45.110
but if that's not reason enough, if you don't, if you don't buy into that,

87
00:04:45.260 --> 00:04:48.990
look at the Lotus flower that it's connected to and how it seems to have a cord

88
00:04:48.991 --> 00:04:53.630
connected to some sort of box guys. I'm not saying that this is a light bulb.

89
00:04:54.250 --> 00:04:58.030
It seems to be symbolic of something very sophisticated. That's all I'm saying.

90
00:04:58.490 --> 00:05:02.220
But when you think about the implications that the pyramids of don't have any

91
00:05:02.620 --> 00:05:06.220
SUT located in them, isn't that really odd? So how did they,

92
00:05:06.290 --> 00:05:09.020
what did they use to illuminate? How did they see when they were building this?

93
00:05:09.400 --> 00:05:13.580
If the 16 chapel that was built thousands of years after the pyramid had tons of

94
00:05:13.581 --> 00:05:15.580
SU in it, why don't the Egyptian pyramids?

95
00:05:16.400 --> 00:05:19.700
Now there is so much information that we don't know about the pyramids of Egypt.

96
00:05:19.960 --> 00:05:20.440
For example,

97
00:05:20.440 --> 00:05:23.890
are you aware that there's two rooms discovered with inside the great pyramid of

98
00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:27.890
Giza as verified through the use of infrared thermography and laser scanning?

99
00:05:27.950 --> 00:05:29.970
And you can see a picture of it here, guys.

100
00:05:29.971 --> 00:05:32.890
There is so much that we still don't know about the pyramid mids,

101
00:05:32.891 --> 00:05:36.050
and now we're finding that there's these other chambers located in that we've

102
00:05:36.051 --> 00:05:37.090
never even seen before.

103
00:05:37.470 --> 00:05:41.090
And does anyone else find it suspicious that the Egyptian government takes years

104
00:05:41.510 --> 00:05:45.360
to make a decision on granting a permit for anyone to investigate or research

105
00:05:45.940 --> 00:05:49.440
any of these areas or these hidden chambers doesn't anyone else find it

106
00:05:49.441 --> 00:05:53.320
completely odd that they keep it shrouded in secrecy and forbid anyone from

107
00:05:53.321 --> 00:05:54.920
looking into this stuff? Yeah,

108
00:05:54.921 --> 00:05:57.520
that's an indicator that they're hiding something. That's be honest,

109
00:05:57.950 --> 00:06:00.760
another little known fact that many people are becoming aware of now,

110
00:06:00.780 --> 00:06:03.560
but still most people have never heard of is the fact that the pyramid,

111
00:06:03.700 --> 00:06:06.680
the great pyramid of Giza has eight sides, not four.

112
00:06:06.900 --> 00:06:10.720
And the reason why this was hidden and unknown for so many centuries is because

113
00:06:10.790 --> 00:06:15.720
it's so subtle that it's only visible at Ducan Dawn during the spring and fall

114
00:06:15.721 --> 00:06:18.990
Equinox. But as you can see in these photographs,

115
00:06:19.170 --> 00:06:23.670
it is there and it's incredibly precise and it further validates the incredible

116
00:06:23.671 --> 00:06:27.670
mathematical formulas and equations that were necessary in order to construct

117
00:06:27.671 --> 00:06:30.630
the pyramids, to have them be completely symmetrical in the ways that they are.

118
00:06:30.930 --> 00:06:34.110
Let me give you some more information that supports that perhaps whoever built

119
00:06:34.111 --> 00:06:37.380
the pyramids were in advanced civilization, for example,

120
00:06:37.480 --> 00:06:42.260
are you aware that approximately 30% of all native American DNA originates

121
00:06:42.330 --> 00:06:43.500
from middle Eastern DNA,

122
00:06:43.850 --> 00:06:46.460
this is something that's only been discovered in the last few years,

123
00:06:47.000 --> 00:06:48.260
but if you don't believe me,

124
00:06:48.920 --> 00:06:52.740
I'm citing national geographic and where it gets even more interesting is that

125
00:06:52.741 --> 00:06:56.540
they're finding DNA in south American mummies that have Egyptian DNA,

126
00:06:56.920 --> 00:07:00.490
or excuse me, a middle Eastern DNA. I can't presume that it was the Egyptians,

127
00:07:00.750 --> 00:07:01.890
but it's middle Eastern DNA.

128
00:07:02.640 --> 00:07:07.010
Explain that furthermore they've established that mummies found in Egypt have

129
00:07:07.011 --> 00:07:09.650
contained cocaine and nicotine guys,

130
00:07:09.960 --> 00:07:14.490
cocaine and nicotine originate from plants that are located nowhere near their

131
00:07:14.491 --> 00:07:17.450
region of the mid east. And hence come from south America.

132
00:07:18.040 --> 00:07:21.160
Could it be further evidence to suggest that there was once an advanced

133
00:07:21.161 --> 00:07:25.240
civilization on earth that was able to travel between the continents? I mean,

134
00:07:25.241 --> 00:07:29.040
how do you explain the incredible similarities between the inking culture in

135
00:07:29.041 --> 00:07:30.760
south America, as well as the Egyptians,

136
00:07:30.790 --> 00:07:35.080
whether it's the same technology of trapezoid doors or whether it's the step

137
00:07:35.120 --> 00:07:39.990
pyramids or whether it's the gold plated funeral mask utilized,

138
00:07:40.470 --> 00:07:41.303
uh, for their mummies.

139
00:07:41.480 --> 00:07:44.950
There are so many other similarities that should be mentioned as well. Guys,

140
00:07:44.951 --> 00:07:47.710
there is so much more information on this subject that needs to be shared.

141
00:07:47.730 --> 00:07:50.750
So look forward to more videos to come. Anyways, guys, I'm Jimmy,

142
00:07:50.940 --> 00:07:53.550
this is bright insight. I can subscribe, help me spread the message.

143
00:07:54.340 --> 00:07:55.670
Take care of everybody. Hey.
