00:00:00.980 --> 00:00:05.080
<v 0>The greatest threat that's coming involves the purchasing panic</v>

2
00:00:05.790 --> 00:00:08.800
that has already begun. It's just the beginning of it.

3
00:00:08.801 --> 00:00:11.320
And it's gonna continue over the next number of days, weeks,

4
00:00:11.420 --> 00:00:15.880
and months and away that has never before been seen in the history of mankind.

5
00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:20.040
You are, you are about to witness the wealthiest nation on earth,

6
00:00:21.170 --> 00:00:22.003
buy everything.

7
00:00:22.190 --> 00:00:26.350
&lt;laugh&gt; it's not funny what I've witnessed in the last few days at Costco and

8
00:00:26.351 --> 00:00:29.390
the grocery store, as well as talking to friends I have from across the country,

9
00:00:30.690 --> 00:00:35.190
what's happening now is about to become a very big deal and it's gonna become an

10
00:00:35.191 --> 00:00:39.830
even bigger deal than the coronavirus itself I would argue. So, and,

11
00:00:40.030 --> 00:00:42.540
and regardless of whether you've think all these people that are stocking up on

12
00:00:42.541 --> 00:00:43.380
food and toilet paper,

13
00:00:43.470 --> 00:00:46.580
regardless of whether you think that that's silly and that these people are

14
00:00:46.581 --> 00:00:50.140
overreacting, I'm here to tell you right now that,

15
00:00:50.141 --> 00:00:54.980
that no longer that that's irrelevant because so many people are now doing

16
00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:55.520
it.

17
00:00:55.520 --> 00:00:59.260
And those numbers are only going to increase and there's no sign in sight of it

18
00:00:59.261 --> 00:01:03.010
slowing down. Let me give you some examples. We all I'll see on the news before,

19
00:01:03.150 --> 00:01:05.690
say a hurricane's coming and there'll be people in, in that region,

20
00:01:06.530 --> 00:01:08.370
flooding the grocery store lines,

21
00:01:08.371 --> 00:01:10.570
really deep people buying water and canned food.

22
00:01:11.950 --> 00:01:15.770
But that's like with a few days of advanced notice of, Hey, the storm's coming,

23
00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:17.930
it's gonna make landfall here. And then within a week,

24
00:01:17.931 --> 00:01:19.810
things are back to normal. Mine is the cleanup.

25
00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:21.930
The thing is with this coronavirus,

26
00:01:22.370 --> 00:01:24.560
regardless of how bad or deadly you think it is,

27
00:01:26.030 --> 00:01:28.680
it's not gonna slow down in that for the next number of weeks,

28
00:01:28.820 --> 00:01:31.640
or even within a few months, this will continue to spread.

29
00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:35.720
And every day that a new celebrity or public figure is diagnosed with it,

30
00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:37.560
more and more people are gonna go to the store.

31
00:01:39.080 --> 00:01:43.670
I was at Costco on Thursday here in Boise, Idaho at 2:00 PM.

32
00:01:43.730 --> 00:01:44.630
And look at these photos,

33
00:01:44.760 --> 00:01:47.670
which don't do it justice because they don't show the lines that are wrapping

34
00:01:47.671 --> 00:01:49.710
around. I couldn't believe what I was seeing.

35
00:01:50.610 --> 00:01:54.510
So many carts that were full to the brim of people loading up. Now,

36
00:01:54.630 --> 00:01:57.070
let me also quickly mention that the cashier,

37
00:01:57.710 --> 00:02:01.390
the himself said that this is as busi or busier than the day before Thanksgiving

38
00:02:01.391 --> 00:02:03.900
or Christmas, which I already knew cuz I out with my own eyes.

39
00:02:04.400 --> 00:02:07.340
My other friend that lives in Austin, Texas was at a Costco that same day,

40
00:02:07.341 --> 00:02:10.020
that morning. And the cashier said the same exact thing.

41
00:02:10.250 --> 00:02:11.620
Another person in California,

42
00:02:12.290 --> 00:02:16.500
same exact thing at a Costco slammed like the day before Thanksgiving.

43
00:02:16.970 --> 00:02:20.220
This is happening everywhere throughout the United States. Um,

44
00:02:20.660 --> 00:02:24.730
I was also at my local grocery store here in Boise, Friday at 3:00 PM.

45
00:02:25.210 --> 00:02:28.690
And Albertson's by my house, which is a low volume store, this particular one.

46
00:02:29.350 --> 00:02:32.090
And I couldn't believe what I was seeing. People's carts were full to the brim.

47
00:02:32.670 --> 00:02:34.770
If you look at here, of course the toilet paper was gone.

48
00:02:34.810 --> 00:02:36.570
I think everyone has already seen or heard this.

49
00:02:36.790 --> 00:02:41.050
The toilet paper has been sold out everywhere. Bleach almost all gone. Uh,

50
00:02:41.710 --> 00:02:45.680
and let me just quickly say that people buying water, that's a waste.

51
00:02:46.130 --> 00:02:49.200
Don't buy water. I'm gonna tell you later in this video, exactly what to buy,

52
00:02:49.700 --> 00:02:52.680
but there's no reason to be stocking up on water because there's no reason to

53
00:02:52.681 --> 00:02:55.800
suggest or think that the city water pumps are gonna shut down or get

54
00:02:55.801 --> 00:02:57.600
contaminated. And even if they were,

55
00:02:57.900 --> 00:03:01.600
you can boil your water or if you get pure nonsense,

56
00:03:01.601 --> 00:03:06.600
bleach eight drops will purify one gallon of drinking water do not waste

57
00:03:06.630 --> 00:03:10.360
your energy. Buying water by various canned foods,

58
00:03:11.030 --> 00:03:14.160
rice and beans like lentils, which is a high percentage of protein.

59
00:03:14.340 --> 00:03:18.280
And the reason why I'm telling you to stock up is because now that we know that

60
00:03:18.281 --> 00:03:21.270
this is gonna continue, regardless of how bad it actually gets,

61
00:03:21.271 --> 00:03:25.110
regardless of how small the percentage of the population is that does get it or

62
00:03:25.111 --> 00:03:28.910
doesn't get it or dies from it. This purchasing panic is going to accelerate.

63
00:03:28.911 --> 00:03:29.744
Like I just mentioned,

64
00:03:30.250 --> 00:03:32.790
and you have to be prepared that if you have to self quarantine,

65
00:03:32.820 --> 00:03:35.790
because you should anticipate getting it, you're all, we're all getting it guys.

66
00:03:36.380 --> 00:03:37.750
Vast majority of us will get it.

67
00:03:38.250 --> 00:03:42.180
You have to be able to that you can stay inside your home for a few weeks. Also,

68
00:03:42.760 --> 00:03:43.740
let me show you something.

69
00:03:43.800 --> 00:03:46.740
Or let me say that other countries are doing these vast lockdowns,

70
00:03:46.741 --> 00:03:49.140
whether it's in Italy or even look at France,

71
00:03:49.520 --> 00:03:53.460
here's an article and the us media isn't covering it. But this is today.

72
00:03:53.461 --> 00:03:55.180
Literally March 14th,

73
00:03:55.540 --> 00:04:00.490
Saturday mass protests of thousands of people in Paris because they don't

74
00:04:00.570 --> 00:04:02.290
wanna be on lockdown. I don't know all the details,

75
00:04:02.430 --> 00:04:06.850
but here's a short 22nd video clip to paint you a picture. Here we go.

76
00:04:25.340 --> 00:04:26.280
So here's my point.

77
00:04:26.580 --> 00:04:29.720
As this continues to grow in the next coming weeks and maybe month here in the

78
00:04:29.721 --> 00:04:33.440
United States, it's gonna start slow, but then it's gonna skyrocket.

79
00:04:33.590 --> 00:04:36.080
Then you're gonna have various leaders that are gonna have to make decisions

80
00:04:36.081 --> 00:04:38.680
because they can't just sit around and do nothing with their hands in the

81
00:04:38.681 --> 00:04:41.510
pockets and look like fools while this epidemic pandemics going on.

82
00:04:42.450 --> 00:04:46.630
So there may be lockdowns in major cities, whether it's LA, Chicago, Atlanta,

83
00:04:46.730 --> 00:04:49.150
New York, whatever, if that happens,

84
00:04:49.210 --> 00:04:52.310
if you are forced to be inside your home for weeks on end and you have not

85
00:04:52.311 --> 00:04:53.230
stocked up on food.

86
00:04:54.700 --> 00:04:57.100
I wonder if that has anything to do with a protest or if people just think that

87
00:04:57.101 --> 00:04:59.220
it's being blown outta proportion again,

88
00:05:00.440 --> 00:05:04.490
the biggest now is the supply chain. So depending on how bad it does get,

89
00:05:04.510 --> 00:05:08.010
you may see. And the reason I'm sharing this is because if these events,

90
00:05:08.110 --> 00:05:09.810
if what I'm about to share with you does happen.

91
00:05:09.950 --> 00:05:13.050
You will have a warning of just how significant this is gonna get.

92
00:05:13.110 --> 00:05:16.450
But if you see various domestic fights, get shut down,

93
00:05:17.910 --> 00:05:20.650
you may see all domestic fights get shut down,

94
00:05:20.930 --> 00:05:25.520
cuz it may start with up major airports, LA O'Hare, Atlanta, Chicago,

95
00:05:26.100 --> 00:05:30.960
or that is O'Hare New York, Honolulu, Seattle, stuff like that. If that happens,

96
00:05:30.980 --> 00:05:34.120
you may have governors begin to shut down borders. And if they do that,

97
00:05:34.420 --> 00:05:39.280
you will witness a terrible fallout from the supply chain that

98
00:05:39.281 --> 00:05:42.040
will already be stressed. Because again, as I show you these pictures,

99
00:05:42.390 --> 00:05:44.070
as you're seeing mark my words come next week,

100
00:05:44.220 --> 00:05:48.830
today's Saturday the 14th come next week. You will see in the news, holy crap,

101
00:05:48.831 --> 00:05:50.470
this and everybody was buying stuff.

102
00:05:50.670 --> 00:05:53.110
Cuz I went by my same Albertons again this morning to buy bananas.

103
00:05:53.730 --> 00:05:56.990
And it was at nine 30 in the morning when it normally slow there and the pace

104
00:05:57.080 --> 00:05:59.320
was packed. Well, almost packed.

105
00:05:59.580 --> 00:06:02.360
The parking lot was full and people were buying loads of food.

106
00:06:03.260 --> 00:06:06.560
So what I'm saying is that regardless of how silly all that sounds guys,

107
00:06:07.300 --> 00:06:08.880
the events that are absolutely coming,

108
00:06:08.881 --> 00:06:11.720
which we know that the virus is gonna continue to spread because guess what?

109
00:06:11.960 --> 00:06:14.920
I don't care what you heard on TV by someone saying that, oh,

110
00:06:14.940 --> 00:06:16.200
it should probably go away.

111
00:06:16.660 --> 00:06:19.950
When summer comes around the warmer months when the flu season typically ends,

112
00:06:20.610 --> 00:06:22.310
one experts have already debunked that.

113
00:06:22.650 --> 00:06:26.390
And let me tell you very logically that you can think for yourself an example of

114
00:06:26.391 --> 00:06:27.224
how you know that that's,

115
00:06:27.920 --> 00:06:31.150
which is that right now it is summer in the Southern hemisphere.

116
00:06:32.210 --> 00:06:36.350
Notice you don't hear anybody anywhere talking about, well, Hey wait a second.

117
00:06:36.370 --> 00:06:39.260
We know it's gonna to go away in the summertime cuz just look at the Southern

118
00:06:39.261 --> 00:06:42.300
hemisphere. There's no coronavirus there. &lt;laugh&gt; there is.

119
00:06:43.080 --> 00:06:44.580
So that's how you know that that's bull crap.

120
00:06:44.640 --> 00:06:48.700
So for the coming weeks and months, at least a few months,

121
00:06:48.701 --> 00:06:50.540
this will continue to spread. And again,

122
00:06:50.690 --> 00:06:53.420
because I know a lot of people are saying it's not as deadly as the regular flu.

123
00:06:53.421 --> 00:06:54.260
Well, hold on a second.

124
00:06:54.280 --> 00:06:57.140
It is about to be it's estimated that it's gonna be 10 to fifth time,

125
00:06:57.770 --> 00:07:02.730
bit 10 to 15 times worse this year than all flu deaths expected because the

126
00:07:02.731 --> 00:07:04.090
numbers are going to skyrocket.

127
00:07:04.870 --> 00:07:07.810
The mortality rate of the coronavirus is approximately 2%.

128
00:07:08.510 --> 00:07:11.970
The flu is just under 1%. The coronavirus is more contagious.

129
00:07:12.470 --> 00:07:13.810
So even though it started small,

130
00:07:13.840 --> 00:07:17.250
it's going to eventually hit this curve where it's gonna skyrocket.

131
00:07:17.251 --> 00:07:21.880
And I fact that that is gonna be in the next few weeks or inside or

132
00:07:21.881 --> 00:07:24.640
approximately a month from now. I don't know this. I'm not a freaking doctor.

133
00:07:24.790 --> 00:07:25.550
Okay.

134
00:07:25.550 --> 00:07:28.960
What I do know is that it's a numbers game and these numbers are about to go up.

135
00:07:28.961 --> 00:07:31.320
So regardless of how bad you wanna debate that it is,

136
00:07:31.630 --> 00:07:33.400
it's almost irrelevant because it's,

137
00:07:34.190 --> 00:07:37.680
it's all relative on based on the reaction of it, how many people are buying,

138
00:07:37.681 --> 00:07:41.590
how much stuff in depleting the stores and how long you may have to wait inside.

139
00:07:41.610 --> 00:07:43.470
If one, you have to self quarantine and two,

140
00:07:43.530 --> 00:07:46.470
if there's some sort of lockdown which may happen. And if that happens,

141
00:07:46.480 --> 00:07:49.790
there are going to be the haves and there are gonna be the have nots picture,

142
00:07:49.791 --> 00:07:52.870
hurricane Katrina for a second. It's a different example.

143
00:07:53.370 --> 00:07:54.990
It was an isolated region while it was large,

144
00:07:55.090 --> 00:07:57.350
but different circumstances as we know,

145
00:07:57.530 --> 00:08:01.220
but within a few days of the collapse of the system and alluding and people not

146
00:08:01.221 --> 00:08:05.340
having stuff they need, there was some chaos. Now let me just say,

147
00:08:05.380 --> 00:08:08.860
I do not anticipate one, that all these borders are gonna get shut down.

148
00:08:08.980 --> 00:08:11.460
I do not anticipate mass civil instability,

149
00:08:12.080 --> 00:08:14.820
but going back to that clip in Paris that I just showed you,

150
00:08:15.250 --> 00:08:18.540
it's fair to say that a lot of Americans, most Americans will not prep for this.

151
00:08:18.640 --> 00:08:20.810
That's what people, most people don't prep at all.

152
00:08:21.590 --> 00:08:25.610
And then all of a sudden when they realize that there's these quarantines and

153
00:08:25.611 --> 00:08:26.730
that things are being put up,

154
00:08:26.731 --> 00:08:29.290
cities are being put on lockdown and they haven't supplied themselves.

155
00:08:30.400 --> 00:08:32.770
Many people will rebel they'll they'll riot.

156
00:08:32.920 --> 00:08:35.170
They'll go to try and steal from others. And, and again,

157
00:08:35.270 --> 00:08:38.130
I'm not suggesting there's be mass civil instability,

158
00:08:39.030 --> 00:08:42.160
but there is absolute the likelihood that in some areas,

159
00:08:42.161 --> 00:08:45.680
for some brief moments of time that you have the losers, the dumb,

160
00:08:45.681 --> 00:08:49.360
violent people out there that didn't prep it all that will instead grab their

161
00:08:49.361 --> 00:08:53.080
weapon and they will try and take from someone else that always happens.

162
00:08:53.230 --> 00:08:54.240
That is what people do,

163
00:08:54.550 --> 00:08:58.720
even though a very small fraction of the population would do that.

164
00:08:59.150 --> 00:09:02.080
It's always enough people to create some issues and you don't want,

165
00:09:02.740 --> 00:09:03.880
you don't want that to be you.

166
00:09:04.580 --> 00:09:08.440
So you also wanna protect yourself and you know what I mean by that? Um,

167
00:09:09.080 --> 00:09:11.680
alright. So let me also say I, I said I would look at my notes. Okay.

168
00:09:12.460 --> 00:09:15.310
Here's what you really freaking need to know about this via is that the numbers

169
00:09:15.550 --> 00:09:17.430
are showing that a lot of people that are dying,

170
00:09:17.431 --> 00:09:20.310
aren't just elderly in the weak they're people in their,

171
00:09:20.311 --> 00:09:22.630
this is data from around the world. Now people in,

172
00:09:22.730 --> 00:09:26.270
in their forties are dying and their smokers or obese.

173
00:09:27.770 --> 00:09:29.750
If you are a smoker, cuz you need to keep in mind,

174
00:09:29.910 --> 00:09:32.390
the people are suffering pneumonia and other complications of the lungs because

175
00:09:32.391 --> 00:09:34.710
of the coronavirus. It's not the coronavirus itself. It's killing you.

176
00:09:34.711 --> 00:09:38.620
It's what comes after. If you are a smoker or a vapor,

177
00:09:38.621 --> 00:09:41.300
whether it's tobacco or the good four 20,

178
00:09:42.760 --> 00:09:47.300
you need to go cold Turkey right now you need healthy

179
00:09:47.430 --> 00:09:49.620
lungs. And within a short period of time, days and weeks,

180
00:09:49.621 --> 00:09:53.620
your lungs will rebound incredibly fast in your immune will skyrocket.

181
00:09:54.280 --> 00:09:55.140
So speaking of immune,

182
00:09:55.530 --> 00:09:58.650
you need to start altering your diets to include foods that are known to

183
00:09:58.810 --> 00:10:01.970
increase your immune system, not just vitamin C, but garlic, avocado,

184
00:10:02.030 --> 00:10:06.410
red peppers, mushroom onion, dark green vegetables, spinach, broccoli. Um,

185
00:10:06.430 --> 00:10:08.690
and there's others Google this, um,

186
00:10:09.270 --> 00:10:12.730
and start implementing that to your daily diet. Also,

187
00:10:12.750 --> 00:10:13.810
if you're a big time drinker,

188
00:10:13.811 --> 00:10:17.360
if you drink on a regular basis or if you like to go out and get hammered on the

189
00:10:17.361 --> 00:10:18.280
weekends and do up the bars,

190
00:10:19.020 --> 00:10:21.360
you should stay away from that because timing is everything.

191
00:10:21.620 --> 00:10:24.280
And the last thing you want is to get in contact with the coronavirus,

192
00:10:24.281 --> 00:10:26.520
which again, you should expect to get the numbers,

193
00:10:26.521 --> 00:10:29.160
show that most people will get it, um, over time.

194
00:10:29.740 --> 00:10:33.880
And the last thing you wanna do is contact and get that crap after a long

195
00:10:33.881 --> 00:10:36.920
weekend of drinking. Think about that.

196
00:10:37.540 --> 00:10:40.160
So cut that crap outta your diet now, I guess. Oh,

197
00:10:40.161 --> 00:10:43.840
and let me also point out that the doctor who exposed the coronavirus to the

198
00:10:43.841 --> 00:10:46.760
world and was silenced by the Chinese government. Um,

199
00:10:47.500 --> 00:10:52.400
if you're not aware he died because of the coronavirus, he was 34 years old,

200
00:10:53.460 --> 00:10:55.200
but he was a smoker. Again,

201
00:10:55.870 --> 00:11:00.390
what I witnessed at the gross restore was I've never seen anything like it when

202
00:11:00.391 --> 00:11:03.910
I witnessed at Costco. And this is just the first few days.

203
00:11:04.610 --> 00:11:08.270
And just think guys, regardless again of how bad you think this is,

204
00:11:08.271 --> 00:11:09.104
or isn't gonna be,

205
00:11:09.340 --> 00:11:13.390
what we do know is that it's gonna continue for the foreseeable future at least

206
00:11:13.690 --> 00:11:17.270
for a few months, probably longer guys. Um,

207
00:11:18.000 --> 00:11:20.220
and so every day more and more people will be like, all right,

208
00:11:20.260 --> 00:11:22.780
I need to buy stuff. The supply chain is limited.

209
00:11:23.680 --> 00:11:26.460
I'm not suggesting for a second that people are gonna start starving to death,

210
00:11:26.461 --> 00:11:27.500
especially in the United States.

211
00:11:28.560 --> 00:11:31.780
But like your life could be incredibly inconvenience that you're used to going

212
00:11:31.781 --> 00:11:33.500
to the store, fast food.

213
00:11:33.501 --> 00:11:36.060
And you should anticipate that things are gonna start closing schools.

214
00:11:36.360 --> 00:11:39.370
So you're gonna have a lot more people that will be eating from home as opposed

215
00:11:39.371 --> 00:11:42.530
to at school, like they're used to, you may have movie theaters and restaurants,

216
00:11:42.810 --> 00:11:47.050
clothes. So like things are gonna, it's gonna stack on top of each other.

217
00:11:47.110 --> 00:11:48.570
The issues is what I'm trying to say.

218
00:11:48.571 --> 00:11:52.770
So if you're gonna suck up and rice and beans do not forget to buy iodized salt,

219
00:11:54.380 --> 00:11:57.240
you need iodine in your body. And as a westerner, American,

220
00:11:57.520 --> 00:12:00.600
whatever our food already has it, you don't need it. Google.

221
00:12:00.601 --> 00:12:02.760
What happens if you don't have enough iodine in your system,

222
00:12:03.310 --> 00:12:05.840
look at the pictures. You don't want that.

223
00:12:06.460 --> 00:12:10.360
So if you're relying on staple food like rice and beans, you need iodized, salt,

224
00:12:10.820 --> 00:12:13.870
buy a couple of them. No other thing, if you're going to,

225
00:12:14.920 --> 00:12:17.430
don't be a piece of, human and buy everything.

226
00:12:18.000 --> 00:12:19.950
Especially if you're looking to sell it for profit,

227
00:12:19.951 --> 00:12:23.590
like all these that are buying toilet paper and they're just selling it for

228
00:12:23.591 --> 00:12:28.230
massive profit, don't be a piece of. Human. Look out for your fellow, man,

229
00:12:28.231 --> 00:12:32.550
your brother, your neighbor. Don't like, this is like God people. Ugh.

230
00:12:34.290 --> 00:12:38.100
Yeah. So yeah. Don't oh, and don't forget pet food. Don't forget pet food.

231
00:12:38.101 --> 00:12:41.260
Because again guys, this might all sound like panic. This might sound like,

232
00:12:41.261 --> 00:12:44.020
okay, he's being silly. He is overreacting. No like again,

233
00:12:44.580 --> 00:12:47.100
everyone else is already doing it or not. Everyone enough people.

234
00:12:47.360 --> 00:12:50.740
And then it's gonna increase with every day that new stories and headlines come

235
00:12:50.741 --> 00:12:52.260
out. So like it,

236
00:12:52.261 --> 00:12:55.010
it's not gonna be undone and gonna continue for the foreseeable future.

237
00:12:55.110 --> 00:12:58.450
So the last thing you want to be is one of the, have nots, just get ahead of it,

238
00:12:58.770 --> 00:13:01.850
buy an appropriate amount. I recommend a few months worth. Honestly,

239
00:13:02.410 --> 00:13:05.410
I bought a few months worth of dog food, which wasn't cheap cuz they're two,

240
00:13:05.411 --> 00:13:08.330
100 pound German shepherds, but Hey, I'm looking out for them.

241
00:13:09.010 --> 00:13:13.370
I bought a few months worth of various canned foods, rice beans, broth, uh,

242
00:13:14.180 --> 00:13:17.760
of cliff bars and other things like that. Um, and I feel good.

243
00:13:17.840 --> 00:13:21.120
I now have the peace of mind that says, Hey, if Jimmy gets coronavirus,

244
00:13:21.121 --> 00:13:24.440
which I am anticipating, I'm not gonna stop going to the gym or going out,

245
00:13:24.500 --> 00:13:28.680
I'm gonna live my life. So I believe that I will survive it.

246
00:13:28.720 --> 00:13:31.040
I I'm optimistic that I'm healthy enough and I'll bounce back.

247
00:13:31.300 --> 00:13:34.400
So I'll just quarantine myself in my house. I'm not going to the hospital.

248
00:13:34.970 --> 00:13:37.710
And that's another thing. If you start to feel a little sick, look,

249
00:13:37.910 --> 00:13:39.230
I may be careful of what I say here,

250
00:13:39.231 --> 00:13:42.750
but don't just go to the fricking hospital because there's only gonna be so many

251
00:13:42.751 --> 00:13:45.590
medical supplies. Like if you are somebody that's at risk, then go.

252
00:13:46.130 --> 00:13:49.470
But if you're just a healthy person, like guys, they recommend just drinking.

253
00:13:49.500 --> 00:13:52.310
Lots of fluid, eat well and vitamins.

254
00:13:52.311 --> 00:13:56.260
And like that's all they can do unless you're like you all,

255
00:13:56.360 --> 00:13:58.820
you already have other health issues. So be careful on that.

256
00:13:58.821 --> 00:14:02.020
Don't exhaust the medical supply either. Don't exhaust the grocery store,

257
00:14:02.021 --> 00:14:05.580
don't exhaust everything or anything. Be, be good about it. So anyways,

258
00:14:05.581 --> 00:14:09.780
I'm gonna wrap this up. I said everything. I think I can say bless everybody.

259
00:14:10.340 --> 00:14:13.700
Um, again, whether you think this is a big panic and overreaction or not,

260
00:14:14.890 --> 00:14:17.930
it's already, &lt;affirmative&gt; doesn't matter because enough people are doing it,

261
00:14:17.931 --> 00:14:21.010
which means that now you have to worry about it cuz panic or not,

262
00:14:21.350 --> 00:14:25.050
you only have so much food in your house. And if, uh, this accelerates,

263
00:14:25.051 --> 00:14:27.570
which it will, it's gonna get worse before it gets better,

264
00:14:28.000 --> 00:14:30.090
then you're gonna have to worry about just planning your meals out.

265
00:14:30.830 --> 00:14:33.810
So think about that. Anyways guys, my name's Jimmy,

266
00:14:33.910 --> 00:14:37.480
my channel's called bright insight. Uh, um, yeah,

267
00:14:38.590 --> 00:14:40.880
take care of everybody. I have. I'm working another video,

268
00:14:40.881 --> 00:14:42.840
which I expect to have out before the end of March.

269
00:14:43.390 --> 00:14:46.440
Hopefully it'll be on the ancients should be an interesting video.

270
00:14:46.580 --> 00:14:49.920
So I'll leave it at that. I hope this information helps you leave a comment,

271
00:14:49.921 --> 00:14:52.160
share what your thoughts are. Take care of everybody.
