00:00:01.080 --> 00:00:02.370
<v 0>Mark my words,</v>

2
00:00:02.490 --> 00:00:07.230
what you're about to witness in my next video is going to blow your fricking

3
00:00:07.231 --> 00:00:10.740
mind for rail. This will be without a doubt,

4
00:00:11.100 --> 00:00:12.960
the best video I have ever made.

5
00:00:13.800 --> 00:00:18.420
You're about to witness a YouTuber, an amateur researcher,

6
00:00:19.170 --> 00:00:23.730
I guy who studied business and has an undergrad in communication,

7
00:00:24.270 --> 00:00:25.230
sociology,

8
00:00:25.231 --> 00:00:29.790
and a minor in religious studies prove and show to you with clear

9
00:00:29.791 --> 00:00:33.930
evidence, proof, pictures that you could see with your own eyes,

10
00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:39.870
that there is something far more mysterious about our ancient past than from

11
00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:45.210
anybody you've ever heard in the academic world or in documentaries.

12
00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:50.970
<v 1>You are going to see clear evidence and proof that there was indeed a</v>

13
00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:56.910
long-lost ancient global civilization that once span virtually our

14
00:00:56.911 --> 00:00:59.250
entire planet for rail,

15
00:00:59.880 --> 00:01:03.870
this evidence has made my own jaw drop.

16
00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:08.480
Now this video was going to suppose to have been done last Friday or earlier

17
00:01:08.481 --> 00:01:11.820
this week, but thanks to partnering with another YouTuber,

18
00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:14.880
I came across some great new evidence on Sunday evening.

19
00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:15.713
<v 0>So I'm like, okay,</v>

20
00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:19.170
let me continue to build this as it changed the narrative of the video for the

21
00:01:19.171 --> 00:01:20.004
better,

22
00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:25.290
but then last night I came across something by chance then made the

23
00:01:25.291 --> 00:01:26.580
video that much better.

24
00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:31.530
But then this morning I came across something. So good,

25
00:01:31.800 --> 00:01:34.920
something that, so for real, when I say this is going to make your jaw drop,

26
00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:38.250
I realized while looking at it that my mouth was open.

27
00:01:38.430 --> 00:01:41.760
I was mouth breathing while looking at this cause I could not believe well,

28
00:01:41.761 --> 00:01:42.301
first of all,

29
00:01:42.301 --> 00:01:46.080
how much better it made this video and how much more convincing of an argument

30
00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:48.180
and made for what I'm suggesting here.

31
00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:52.440
But the fact that I've been researching the topic of loss,

32
00:01:52.460 --> 00:01:55.620
ancient civilizations for about four no more than four years now,

33
00:01:55.621 --> 00:02:00.210
closer to five years. And I've never seen or heard of this before. Like what,

34
00:02:01.110 --> 00:02:04.170
so many of the things that I've come across while building this video,

35
00:02:04.171 --> 00:02:06.930
I couldn't believe I had never seen or heard of before now.

36
00:02:07.470 --> 00:02:10.320
Some of these things, maybe some of you would have seen before,

37
00:02:10.321 --> 00:02:13.260
and I'm going to say some of you, I'm talking about people.

38
00:02:13.261 --> 00:02:16.620
Who've been following this topic where my channel for a few years,

39
00:02:17.340 --> 00:02:21.150
but so many other things that are included this in this video are things that

40
00:02:21.151 --> 00:02:23.670
it's very unlikely that you've seen.

41
00:02:24.360 --> 00:02:29.010
And you'll find yourself asking why now other people that aren't

42
00:02:29.280 --> 00:02:33.510
as nerds for this awesome topic of ancient civilizations.

43
00:02:34.410 --> 00:02:38.850
Oh my their minds are about to be blown for rail. Uh,

44
00:02:38.940 --> 00:02:39.600
so yeah,

45
00:02:39.600 --> 00:02:43.950
I have never been more excited about a video in my whole life because it's going

46
00:02:43.951 --> 00:02:47.640
to bring up all kinds of questions involving what we thought we knew about our

47
00:02:47.641 --> 00:02:48.660
ancient past,

48
00:02:49.380 --> 00:02:52.960
regardless of how old you think or how advanced do you think we work is there's

49
00:02:52.961 --> 00:02:56.850
a lot of debates for that among ancient history enthusiasts.

50
00:02:56.850 --> 00:02:59.070
There's all kinds of bickering back and forth about that.

51
00:02:59.710 --> 00:03:02.200
But this will show that without a doubt,

52
00:03:02.440 --> 00:03:07.240
what we were taught and is still being taught in school is so full of holes and

53
00:03:07.241 --> 00:03:10.240
so full of mystery because you're going to ask yourselves, woo,

54
00:03:10.270 --> 00:03:14.440
why haven't I seen or heard of this before? It's that incredible.

55
00:03:14.470 --> 00:03:19.030
Now I can't take all the credit in facts. So many things. I'm not guys,

56
00:03:19.031 --> 00:03:20.230
I'm an amateur researcher.

57
00:03:20.260 --> 00:03:24.130
I'm just connecting dots and I'm presenting things in what I consider or hope to

58
00:03:24.131 --> 00:03:26.440
be an engaging, fun way,

59
00:03:26.920 --> 00:03:30.910
a way that gets people talking and in a way that keeps people's attention spans

60
00:03:30.911 --> 00:03:33.520
going, which is no easy task nowadays, right?

61
00:03:34.480 --> 00:03:36.430
So I have other people to thank,

62
00:03:36.431 --> 00:03:39.220
there are other people that have talked about these subjects,

63
00:03:39.221 --> 00:03:41.380
some of which that I've going to be sharing,

64
00:03:41.770 --> 00:03:46.630
but they haven't necessarily connected the dots on everything else.

65
00:03:47.140 --> 00:03:51.430
And that's where things start to get really interesting because the implications

66
00:03:51.431 --> 00:03:54.430
of what I'm about to share are game-changing,

67
00:03:54.790 --> 00:03:59.290
it's it proves that our textbooks have to be rewritten. And by the way,

68
00:03:59.291 --> 00:04:02.890
there was already enough evidence to suggest that other professional researchers

69
00:04:02.891 --> 00:04:05.950
that have been studying these topics for decades have already done an incredible

70
00:04:05.951 --> 00:04:07.480
job of doing that.

71
00:04:07.900 --> 00:04:11.590
But there's still this massive resistance among the academic community.

72
00:04:11.710 --> 00:04:12.970
The people that write the textbooks,

73
00:04:12.971 --> 00:04:15.280
the people who decide what's taught in school,

74
00:04:15.730 --> 00:04:19.900
they resist the topic of an ancient connection among

75
00:04:20.740 --> 00:04:24.250
passive realizations as completely postrace they,

76
00:04:24.340 --> 00:04:28.960
they profusely say that no, there is no ancient connection. Nope.

77
00:04:29.170 --> 00:04:32.890
The Egyptians were the Egyptians, the, the cultures of, uh,

78
00:04:32.920 --> 00:04:37.150
central and south America were there, but there's no connection at all.

79
00:04:37.151 --> 00:04:41.800
But what you're going to see in this video is a connection across the world

80
00:04:42.430 --> 00:04:45.910
in countries that you never realized that these ancient megalithic sites ever

81
00:04:45.911 --> 00:04:46.744
existed,

82
00:04:47.110 --> 00:04:51.430
and the similarities are clear as day for all that have eyes to see,

83
00:04:51.431 --> 00:04:56.020
as like I said, now, great news channel update here.

84
00:04:56.170 --> 00:04:58.990
So I've cleared plenty of things off my plate,

85
00:04:59.020 --> 00:05:02.530
in my own life now to where I can actually focus on YouTubing.

86
00:05:03.670 --> 00:05:06.520
Full-time all in. And I've been trying to make that happen for a while now.

87
00:05:07.180 --> 00:05:12.130
So the intention going forward is to make at least one video every three

88
00:05:12.131 --> 00:05:15.880
weeks. I mean, I would like to do two videos a month and that's kind of a goal,

89
00:05:15.881 --> 00:05:19.360
but that can be hard to pull off because I want each video I make to be really

90
00:05:19.361 --> 00:05:22.660
good and to do that, the amount it takes time to research.

91
00:05:22.810 --> 00:05:26.350
And then it takes time to come up with the creativity of presenting it in an

92
00:05:26.351 --> 00:05:27.190
engaging way,

93
00:05:27.880 --> 00:05:32.530
and then digging up photos and connecting everything and writing up the script

94
00:05:32.620 --> 00:05:35.080
and everything else for the video. It all takes time.

95
00:05:35.081 --> 00:05:37.900
So every two weeks might not be doable,

96
00:05:37.930 --> 00:05:40.740
but if I could do once every three weeks and that means some months, yeah,

97
00:05:40.840 --> 00:05:44.620
it would overlap to where I had to come out in a month. That would be awesome.

98
00:05:46.090 --> 00:05:48.310
Um, so yeah, like mark, my words,

99
00:05:48.340 --> 00:05:50.920
this will be my best video yet because it's going,

100
00:05:51.250 --> 00:05:54.820
because the last several videos I've made have all been building upon that.

101
00:05:54.821 --> 00:05:57.410
Yeah. There's a lot more to the story of our ancient past,

102
00:05:57.470 --> 00:06:02.120
and it's a fascinating mystery. And with all the new technology that we have,

103
00:06:02.360 --> 00:06:06.470
you know, in 2020, we can start digging into more answers because you know,

104
00:06:06.590 --> 00:06:09.230
a lot of people don't realize that most of the stuff we were taught in school

105
00:06:09.290 --> 00:06:12.950
was based on speculation with little to no proof, many things,

106
00:06:13.340 --> 00:06:17.180
just things that were stated or written about 160 plus years ago,

107
00:06:17.210 --> 00:06:19.280
or much of the same things that are taught in school today,

108
00:06:19.730 --> 00:06:23.540
despite overwhelming scientific evidence that contradicts it.

109
00:06:24.380 --> 00:06:26.900
So yeah, this is something that's,

110
00:06:26.901 --> 00:06:30.260
regardless of what's your personal beliefs are involving our ancient past one

111
00:06:30.261 --> 00:06:33.380
thing. We're all going to be able to agree on is that whoa,

112
00:06:33.410 --> 00:06:37.490
there's way more to the story. Even people that stick to their textbooks,

113
00:06:37.520 --> 00:06:40.400
like a religion, because to be honest,

114
00:06:40.401 --> 00:06:42.290
many people in the academic and scientific world,

115
00:06:42.291 --> 00:06:44.570
it is kind of their belief system.

116
00:06:44.571 --> 00:06:47.660
It's just the same part of the brain as people that are super religious,

117
00:06:47.810 --> 00:06:48.920
they all have something in common,

118
00:06:48.921 --> 00:06:52.340
which is that when you disagree with something that they've been teaching or

119
00:06:52.341 --> 00:06:54.860
thought they knew their whole lives, and you say, otherwise, just like,

120
00:06:54.861 --> 00:06:58.490
if you said to someone super religious or whatever, you know, they get upset.

121
00:06:58.700 --> 00:07:00.950
And this is something that we've seen in the scientific community,

122
00:07:01.550 --> 00:07:03.560
going back hundreds of years. I mean, oh my God,

123
00:07:03.800 --> 00:07:08.660
look how they treated Galileo and Copernicus look how they treated the

124
00:07:08.690 --> 00:07:10.130
Wright brothers before the flight.

125
00:07:10.160 --> 00:07:12.860
Like a lot of people that showed up to watch that were there to watch them die.

126
00:07:13.340 --> 00:07:15.860
We were calling them losers and stuff or whatever words they were calling them

127
00:07:16.010 --> 00:07:18.380
because they knew it was impossible. You know?

128
00:07:18.410 --> 00:07:22.460
So the same type of mentality exists today. Humans haven't changed.

129
00:07:23.060 --> 00:07:26.450
The ancient philosophers from thousands of years ago,

130
00:07:26.840 --> 00:07:30.710
wrote about the human condition in such an epically accurate way that it just

131
00:07:30.711 --> 00:07:32.330
shows that nothing has changed.

132
00:07:32.660 --> 00:07:35.670
And the same thing exists in the academic world and scientific world.

133
00:07:35.770 --> 00:07:38.360
And this isn't like to dis it's not to say they're wrong,

134
00:07:38.480 --> 00:07:41.540
but everything is just to simply to say that when new information comes to

135
00:07:41.541 --> 00:07:43.160
light, it's really hard to accept.

136
00:07:43.760 --> 00:07:45.680
But when I'm about to show you is going to make it,

137
00:07:47.690 --> 00:07:49.760
it's going to be interesting to see what people have to say,

138
00:07:49.761 --> 00:07:54.620
the naysayers that is. So, uh, now I have to say that, Hey guys,

139
00:07:54.710 --> 00:07:59.150
yeah, this video, I really hope to have it done Friday afternoon,

140
00:07:59.810 --> 00:08:03.200
but it's going to be tight because there's all this new information I found the

141
00:08:03.201 --> 00:08:05.600
last few days. It's like, I just have to rearrange things.

142
00:08:05.601 --> 00:08:08.930
And the hardest part about this video is that even though the pictures speak for

143
00:08:08.931 --> 00:08:12.170
themselves, I have to present it in a way that's engaging.

144
00:08:12.200 --> 00:08:14.000
Which means that the,

145
00:08:14.090 --> 00:08:18.590
the order I put the information in the cadence in which I deliver it all has to

146
00:08:18.591 --> 00:08:23.030
be done just right in order to make this video as successful as possible.

147
00:08:23.330 --> 00:08:23.721
Plus,

148
00:08:23.721 --> 00:08:27.890
I'm still struggling with the title and thumbnail might have the title down,

149
00:08:27.891 --> 00:08:32.720
but it's hard to figure out a creative thumbnail that portrays what I'm

150
00:08:32.721 --> 00:08:36.350
trying to share without it looking too click babyish.

151
00:08:36.380 --> 00:08:38.840
Because on the surface, if I say, oh yes,

152
00:08:39.350 --> 00:08:42.620
there was a long lost ancient global civilization that once ruled virtually the

153
00:08:42.621 --> 00:08:47.090
entire planet, people just like, okay, no one had heard about that.

154
00:08:47.091 --> 00:08:48.950
If that was true next, right.

155
00:08:49.010 --> 00:08:50.930
Even though what I'm about to show you is going to prove it.

156
00:08:50.930 --> 00:08:54.500
So I have to be very creative on this. Um, so yeah,

157
00:08:54.530 --> 00:08:58.680
I communicated on social media that I intended to have this video done by last

158
00:08:58.681 --> 00:09:02.970
Friday or early this week at the latest. And now today's Wednesday.

159
00:09:03.540 --> 00:09:06.720
And the soonest I could get this done is Friday afternoon,

160
00:09:07.290 --> 00:09:08.550
but that's tight.

161
00:09:08.670 --> 00:09:13.350
And I don't like to upload on weekends because normally the algorithms

162
00:09:13.410 --> 00:09:15.990
favor videos that are uploaded during the week.

163
00:09:16.020 --> 00:09:19.210
This is something I've seen in my own experience, as well as,

164
00:09:19.350 --> 00:09:21.810
as something that I've read about in depth while just trying to build my

165
00:09:21.811 --> 00:09:26.370
channel, figure out how the algorithms work. So, no,

166
00:09:26.371 --> 00:09:28.620
I'm not uploading Saturday or Sunday, even though. Yeah,

167
00:09:28.710 --> 00:09:30.720
of course there are videos that are uploaded on weekends.

168
00:09:30.780 --> 00:09:32.160
They get millions and millions of views.

169
00:09:32.880 --> 00:09:37.140
I'd rather do Monday instead of Saturday or Sunday. Um,

170
00:09:37.380 --> 00:09:40.950
so yeah, that's, that's planned for Monday at the latest,

171
00:09:41.070 --> 00:09:45.480
and this will be my best video yet. Guys. I've never been more excited.

172
00:09:45.600 --> 00:09:50.100
It will definitely get conversations going. And let me also think by the way,

173
00:09:50.130 --> 00:09:52.320
because I've missed deadlines before.

174
00:09:52.380 --> 00:09:57.360
And trust me when I say that nobody feels worse or more upset about that

175
00:09:57.361 --> 00:10:00.900
than me. It's sucks feeling that way, but my intentions have been good.

176
00:10:01.320 --> 00:10:04.230
Sometimes it's just, it's hard. You create a goal for yourself.

177
00:10:04.350 --> 00:10:07.110
And when you do all this alone and you keep finding more information,

178
00:10:07.111 --> 00:10:08.670
it just keeps pushing things back.

179
00:10:08.910 --> 00:10:12.840
And so I don't want to just put something else, something out and half-ass it.

180
00:10:13.800 --> 00:10:15.570
Cause I have, I have videos from a couple of years ago,

181
00:10:15.660 --> 00:10:19.050
they had millions of views that I had no idea we're going to get millions of

182
00:10:19.051 --> 00:10:19.884
views.

183
00:10:19.950 --> 00:10:23.460
And I've wished I could go back in time and like change things or double-check

184
00:10:23.461 --> 00:10:25.200
things or make better arguments. But I,

185
00:10:25.210 --> 00:10:27.990
at that time I was just trying to get better at making videos,

186
00:10:27.991 --> 00:10:30.210
talking in front of the camera, making, you know,

187
00:10:30.211 --> 00:10:33.060
provocative thumbnails and titles that, you know, to market it,

188
00:10:33.061 --> 00:10:35.730
to get people to click. Right. Um,

189
00:10:35.790 --> 00:10:39.330
but so that being said that sometimes you can't rush creativity.

190
00:10:39.331 --> 00:10:43.980
So my bad for having missed deadlines in the past, but this,

191
00:10:44.160 --> 00:10:48.690
this will be worth it. This, this is absolutely going to be worth the wait.

192
00:10:49.530 --> 00:10:53.970
Um, so let me say thank you to every all of my loyal supporters.

193
00:10:54.000 --> 00:10:55.530
Thank you all for everything.

194
00:10:56.070 --> 00:11:00.840
Thank you to all of my Patrion supporters past and present. I mean,

195
00:11:00.841 --> 00:11:03.090
there's plenty of people that are patron sports in the past and,

196
00:11:03.120 --> 00:11:05.280
and aren't any longer, but Hey, thank you. You have,

197
00:11:05.760 --> 00:11:09.690
without a doubt made an impact in my life and my ability to get to where I am

198
00:11:09.691 --> 00:11:10.524
now.

199
00:11:10.920 --> 00:11:15.660
I'm so unbelievably grateful as well as to all the people that have signed up to

200
00:11:15.661 --> 00:11:18.740
be members of the bright insight channel. It's the community thing.

201
00:11:18.760 --> 00:11:22.620
You can see it below the video where it says join. Um, I never asked for it.

202
00:11:22.621 --> 00:11:24.660
I never brought it up. I launched it. And,

203
00:11:24.830 --> 00:11:29.400
and then a bunch of people came back to my videos and signed up and I am so I'm

204
00:11:29.401 --> 00:11:33.540
so grateful. So all this being said, I'll close this up,

205
00:11:33.780 --> 00:11:37.080
but our closest video up and get back to work. But, uh, yeah,

206
00:11:37.140 --> 00:11:39.360
I'm pretty sure you guys are in for something good here.

207
00:11:39.420 --> 00:11:43.740
And I just want to say thanks to everybody and that's, that's shoot for Monday,

208
00:11:45.060 --> 00:11:49.320
Friday afternoon at the, at the earliest, but Monday, this is the same Monday.

209
00:11:49.800 --> 00:11:54.300
Anyways guys, I'm Jimmy. This is bright insight. Thanks for watching. And, uh,

210

Take care.
