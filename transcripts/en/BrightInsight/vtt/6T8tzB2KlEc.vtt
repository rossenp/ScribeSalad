00:00:00.300 --> 00:00:01.133
<v 0>Oh, my God.</v>

2
00:00:01.680 --> 00:00:06.160
If ancient humans could see practically an entire society standing outside in a

3
00:00:06.190 --> 00:00:10.800
line of a Walmart on black Friday, they would probably crap their pants.

4
00:00:10.940 --> 00:00:13.160
And PKE in their mouths at the exact same time,

5
00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:15.480
because you know what they'd wanna give you for a gift,

6
00:00:15.481 --> 00:00:19.840
whether it be for Christmas or a birthday or for anything fricking wisdom,

7
00:00:20.440 --> 00:00:22.950
cuz clearly our society is freaking sick.

8
00:00:22.951 --> 00:00:24.910
And if you wanna know what the gift is, I have it right in my hand,

9
00:00:24.911 --> 00:00:27.230
you can get it for $3 and 99 cents.

10
00:00:27.730 --> 00:00:32.030
And that is the Dow a Chan. Now hold on. If you're thinking, oh,

11
00:00:32.031 --> 00:00:35.310
this video is not for me. Wait a second. I'm giving you fricking pearls here.

12
00:00:35.311 --> 00:00:38.150
In fact, let me just dive into this and share a few examples here,

13
00:00:38.350 --> 00:00:40.270
cuz there's super quick. You need to know this. Isn't just a book.

14
00:00:40.540 --> 00:00:44.460
It's a 81 chapters and each chapter's less than a page long. In fact,

15
00:00:44.461 --> 00:00:48.620
most are even just a sentence or a couple sentences long. And just to clarify,

16
00:00:48.760 --> 00:00:52.900
before I dive into this Dow Aing means the way or the book of the way.

17
00:00:53.260 --> 00:00:54.260
I have a couple videos in this.

18
00:00:54.261 --> 00:00:57.660
Most of my subscribers haven't even seen them or heard of the Dow Aing so you

19
00:00:57.661 --> 00:01:00.140
may have you seen those other videos. You here the same things over again,

20
00:01:00.340 --> 00:01:03.130
probably, but here we go. Paradoxal truth.

21
00:01:03.880 --> 00:01:08.850
Nothing is general than water yet. Nothing can withstand its force. Likewise,

22
00:01:08.920 --> 00:01:13.130
nothing compares to the Dow by it. The weak defeat, the strong,

23
00:01:13.510 --> 00:01:16.930
the flexible conquer, the rigid. Everyone knows this to be true.

24
00:01:16.990 --> 00:01:21.890
Yet few put it into practice. Priests are often the worst sinner.

25
00:01:22.930 --> 00:01:25.920
Government officers are often the worst criminals.

26
00:01:26.500 --> 00:01:30.040
The truth is often paradoxal like holy crap. How, how true is that?

27
00:01:30.100 --> 00:01:32.760
People haven't changed. Have they? Here's a great one.

28
00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:37.520
Ignorance to know that there are some things that you cannot know is mental

29
00:01:37.540 --> 00:01:41.640
health to not know things that you should know is illness.

30
00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:45.270
The one Iceman recognizes that there are limits to his knowledge.

31
00:01:45.970 --> 00:01:48.750
The foolish man thinks he knows everything like wow,

32
00:01:49.090 --> 00:01:52.630
our society is rampant with that too. Right? This is why this is a,

33
00:01:53.030 --> 00:01:54.670
a gift that you should give to anyone.

34
00:01:54.671 --> 00:01:57.150
Whether it be a kid because they might not have any interest in it today,

35
00:01:57.330 --> 00:01:59.390
but it'll be on their bookshelf. And even years down the road,

36
00:01:59.500 --> 00:02:03.300
they'll pick it up at the right time. The same goes for anyone, buy this people,

37
00:02:03.490 --> 00:02:06.420
even who you think just won't be into it, tell 'em to hold onto it.

38
00:02:06.421 --> 00:02:09.060
And by the way, this is like the best coffee table book ever.

39
00:02:09.300 --> 00:02:09.821
It's one of those things,

40
00:02:09.821 --> 00:02:13.060
you just leave it laying around and you pick it up at the right time and you

41
00:02:13.061 --> 00:02:15.420
look through it and it makes you think about things that actually matter.

42
00:02:15.640 --> 00:02:20.340
So how about immateriality that's an important one. A wheel may have 30 spokes,

43
00:02:20.600 --> 00:02:24.970
but it's usefulness lies in the empty hub. A jar is form from clay,

44
00:02:25.390 --> 00:02:29.810
but its usefulness lies in the empty center. A room is made from four walls,

45
00:02:30.230 --> 00:02:35.010
but its usefulness lies in the space between in the same way matter is

46
00:02:35.011 --> 00:02:36.330
necessary to give form.

47
00:02:37.190 --> 00:02:40.530
But the value of reality lies in immateriality.

48
00:02:41.520 --> 00:02:44.400
That is everything that lives has a physical body,

49
00:02:45.140 --> 00:02:48.720
but the value of life is measured by the soul, right guys,

50
00:02:48.721 --> 00:02:51.680
it doesn't matter who you are, what you look like, what your capabilities are.

51
00:02:52.390 --> 00:02:54.320
It's about content of character. Am I wrong?

52
00:02:54.700 --> 00:02:58.000
And speaking of content of character, what do the ancients say about integrity,

53
00:02:58.770 --> 00:03:01.080
which is better fame or integrity,

54
00:03:01.960 --> 00:03:04.760
which is more valuable riches or good character,

55
00:03:05.600 --> 00:03:10.320
which is more dangerous success or loss over indulgence creates

56
00:03:10.370 --> 00:03:12.240
waste, hoarding invites loss.

57
00:03:12.820 --> 00:03:16.440
The man who is content with what he has is not in danger of loss.

58
00:03:17.060 --> 00:03:19.470
The man who knows when to stop is free to go on.

59
00:03:19.471 --> 00:03:22.030
And this ties into the ying and yang, which they also talk about,

60
00:03:22.031 --> 00:03:26.390
which is there are some things which it is a gain to lose and a loss to gain.

61
00:03:26.880 --> 00:03:30.710
Think about that. So lastly, let's wrap this up with the very last one in here,

62
00:03:30.711 --> 00:03:32.030
which is called true words.

63
00:03:33.060 --> 00:03:36.830
True words are often unpleasant pleasant words are often untrue.

64
00:03:37.360 --> 00:03:41.980
Those who know the truth, do not argue those who argue, do not know the truth.

65
00:03:42.820 --> 00:03:47.340
Scholars are seldom. The wisest men wise, men are seldom scholars.

66
00:03:47.910 --> 00:03:50.140
Those who steal from others, impoverished themselves.

67
00:03:50.590 --> 00:03:55.380
Those who give to others become rich. Those who fight do not win. Those who win,

68
00:03:55.400 --> 00:03:58.740
do not fight. This is the way of the Dow. Now again,

69
00:03:58.741 --> 00:04:02.490
there's 81 passages or chapters and I just read five and there's so many others

70
00:04:02.491 --> 00:04:05.970
that are so awesome. And they tie into so many different things,

71
00:04:05.971 --> 00:04:10.490
whether it's the desire for power force, war materialism,

72
00:04:10.720 --> 00:04:14.210
it's something that every leader in the world should be required to read.

73
00:04:14.630 --> 00:04:16.810
But again, it's something that absolutely everyone should read.

74
00:04:17.390 --> 00:04:18.330
And the ancients,

75
00:04:18.331 --> 00:04:23.280
the philosophers of old really have the human condition figured out and now more

76
00:04:23.281 --> 00:04:27.440
than ever, it's time to help spread the knowledge. So you can give a gift of,

77
00:04:27.441 --> 00:04:30.880
you know, luxurious items or whatever it it may be. And that's great.

78
00:04:31.220 --> 00:04:34.280
But if you are desiring materialism and gifts in order to be happy,

79
00:04:35.100 --> 00:04:37.920
it goes nowhere, but a bad direction. It never works out.

80
00:04:38.030 --> 00:04:40.480
They've known this for thousands of years and just look at the richest,

81
00:04:40.620 --> 00:04:42.430
most powerful people on this planet.

82
00:04:43.390 --> 00:04:46.190
I don't know too many of 'em that appear to be too happy. I mean,

83
00:04:46.191 --> 00:04:49.190
you might know people in your own life, you know, incredibly successful,

84
00:04:49.240 --> 00:04:52.150
great jobs, lots of money, lots of luxurious items,

85
00:04:52.330 --> 00:04:54.230
but how many of them are truly happy?

86
00:04:54.530 --> 00:04:57.390
How many of them are drunk or cheating on their spouse or doing whatever and

87
00:04:57.391 --> 00:05:01.700
just clearly focused on attaining something that well you're is never gonna get

88
00:05:01.701 --> 00:05:04.300
through materialism. So anyways guys, this is,

89
00:05:04.340 --> 00:05:06.420
I would argue is the best gift you could ever give anyone.

90
00:05:06.421 --> 00:05:09.460
So I'll just wrap it up there. I'm Jimmy, this is bright insight.

91
00:05:09.540 --> 00:05:12.740
I can subscribe and I'll put a link in the description for the one that I

92
00:05:12.741 --> 00:05:16.140
bought, uh, on Amazon they'll be in there and it was edited,

93
00:05:16.160 --> 00:05:18.620
edited by a Sam to road. But, uh,

94
00:05:18.640 --> 00:05:22.090
you can download this for free on the internet, different places apparently.

95
00:05:22.091 --> 00:05:24.570
And there's a lot of different versions. So get whichever one's right for you,

96
00:05:24.571 --> 00:05:26.810
but I'll leave it at that take care of everybody.
