00:00:01.130 --> 00:00:02.000
<v 0>Nevermind.</v>

2
00:00:02.210 --> 00:00:06.410
The Nikola Tesla was probably the smartest person to have ever have lived.

3
00:00:06.770 --> 00:00:11.450
Nevermind that 80% of all of your technology is because of

4
00:00:11.451 --> 00:00:12.284
him,

5
00:00:12.320 --> 00:00:15.950
nevermind that almost every single electronic item or anything you have that

6
00:00:15.951 --> 00:00:20.720
plugs in or charges is a direct result of his works and achievements and

7
00:00:21.380 --> 00:00:22.040
inventions,

8
00:00:22.040 --> 00:00:26.450
nevermind that he could speak eight languages or that he had 700 patents from

9
00:00:26.451 --> 00:00:31.280
around the world or that the electric motor, your radio,

10
00:00:31.820 --> 00:00:36.290
remote controls, lasers, limitless,

11
00:00:36.291 --> 00:00:37.550
free energy potentially.

12
00:00:37.970 --> 00:00:41.870
And the alternating current are all a result of his works.

13
00:00:41.960 --> 00:00:43.970
And yet most people aren't even aware of him.

14
00:00:44.090 --> 00:00:47.930
<v 1>All you hear about is Thomas Edison, who created the light bulb as you're aware.</v>

15
00:00:48.740 --> 00:00:53.630
And yet Thomas Edison was practically without Tesla. Now,

16
00:00:53.660 --> 00:00:57.740
hold on. I know that Thomas Edison was a brilliant man. However,

17
00:00:57.770 --> 00:01:02.480
the foundation of most of his inventions are because of Tesla's work.

18
00:01:03.140 --> 00:01:03.501
<v 0>In fact,</v>

19
00:01:03.501 --> 00:01:08.180
are you aware that Thomas Edison had promised $10,000 to Tesla in order to

20
00:01:08.181 --> 00:01:09.620
approve his DC current,

21
00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:13.130
which he was having issues with at the time and in the process,

22
00:01:13.131 --> 00:01:16.340
Tesla ended up inventing the AC current, the alternating current,

23
00:01:16.610 --> 00:01:20.840
which is what we use in anywhere in modern, in the modern world for electricity.

24
00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:25.280
It requires significantly less power to be used. And it's just brilliant.

25
00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:28.490
And Edison didn't like that because it wasn't his invention.

26
00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:32.120
So he refused to pay Tesla, his $10,000. And instead,

27
00:01:32.121 --> 00:01:35.870
he went on an aggressive marketing campaign to try and convince the public.

28
00:01:35.871 --> 00:01:39.290
And the powers that be that the alternating current was bad.

29
00:01:39.291 --> 00:01:41.690
It would burn down cities and every house in America.

30
00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:45.830
And he even went to the extent to kill an electrocute and elephant dogs and

31
00:01:45.831 --> 00:01:49.130
horses to try and prove his point, that guys,

32
00:01:49.131 --> 00:01:51.950
a sicko Edison can go screw himself. Like for real,

33
00:01:52.070 --> 00:01:55.460
he's not who people think he was, he was a dirt bag, a greedy money,

34
00:01:55.461 --> 00:01:58.670
hungry dirt bag. All that being said, uh,

35
00:01:59.150 --> 00:02:02.240
Edison failed in his attempt because obviously Tesla's invention of the AC

36
00:02:02.241 --> 00:02:04.610
current was so superior that here it is today.

37
00:02:05.360 --> 00:02:08.000
Yet when I mentioned limited this limitless free energy,

38
00:02:08.360 --> 00:02:11.390
there is enough evidence that suggests that Tesla had figured that out.

39
00:02:11.630 --> 00:02:12.560
And when I say evidence,

40
00:02:12.561 --> 00:02:15.620
I would say more of qualifying evidence rather than quantitative,

41
00:02:16.130 --> 00:02:18.050
but if you're not aware, Tesla,

42
00:02:18.051 --> 00:02:22.910
despite all of his achievements died poor and shunned at the age of 86.

43
00:02:23.210 --> 00:02:25.310
And when he died less than two days later,

44
00:02:25.311 --> 00:02:29.030
the United States government raided his hotel room and took absolutely

45
00:02:29.031 --> 00:02:31.730
everything out of it. All of his works, his map, everything,

46
00:02:32.240 --> 00:02:34.250
and who knows what they did with it.

47
00:02:34.280 --> 00:02:38.300
They claim that they gave everything back to his family later on, uh, in Europe,

48
00:02:38.360 --> 00:02:41.900
but nobody knows for sure what they took now with all this being said.

49
00:02:41.900 --> 00:02:46.010
And there's many other things I can mention about him like x-rays or spark plugs

50
00:02:46.011 --> 00:02:50.270
and everything else that is in our lives today can be credited at their root

51
00:02:50.360 --> 00:02:51.620
because of the works of Tesla.

52
00:02:51.621 --> 00:02:53.900
But I have to stop there cause I can keep going on about that.

53
00:02:54.290 --> 00:02:58.310
The most important achievements that he had wasn't necessarily the death Ray

54
00:02:58.311 --> 00:03:02.260
that is believed that he created that his works are probably the result now of

55
00:03:02.261 --> 00:03:06.490
some incredible top secret weapons of mass destruction that have been utilized

56
00:03:06.491 --> 00:03:09.280
or have been created, I should say by the United States government,

57
00:03:09.310 --> 00:03:10.480
which a lot of people are interested in.

58
00:03:10.481 --> 00:03:13.990
People are fascinated by what it was a Tesla had figured out that was the made

59
00:03:13.991 --> 00:03:16.420
the United States government. So eager to take his stuff.

60
00:03:17.020 --> 00:03:19.810
And obviously limitless free energy is one of them because the powers that be

61
00:03:20.110 --> 00:03:20.950
don't want limitless,

62
00:03:20.951 --> 00:03:24.250
free energy that you only have to look at today and how the biggest corporations

63
00:03:24.251 --> 00:03:27.940
on planet earth have bought up almost all of the water rights that they possibly

64
00:03:27.941 --> 00:03:32.830
can in order to be able to charge mankind for the most crucial

65
00:03:32.890 --> 00:03:35.800
element that we need or thing that we need, which is water.

66
00:03:36.400 --> 00:03:40.120
So nevermind all that because I have a theory that Tesla had discovered

67
00:03:40.121 --> 00:03:43.900
something far more significant. That's used it as an example,

68
00:03:43.901 --> 00:03:45.640
and I'll be throwing some quotes up here on the screen.

69
00:03:45.641 --> 00:03:47.500
I'll read some of them to you. Um,

70
00:03:47.530 --> 00:03:50.770
but feel free to press pause in case I don't leave it up on the screen long

71
00:03:50.771 --> 00:03:51.910
enough for you to read it. So,

72
00:03:52.390 --> 00:03:56.290
but let's look at like this Tesla never went to work in his laboratory or

73
00:03:56.291 --> 00:03:58.390
creating his inventions without PR.

74
00:03:58.450 --> 00:04:02.230
What he did first I should say is to develop the idea in his brain.

75
00:04:02.350 --> 00:04:05.980
And then he would go through every possible thing that could go wrong with it,

76
00:04:06.040 --> 00:04:07.720
any opportunity for improvement.

77
00:04:07.721 --> 00:04:11.380
And he would work it all out in simply just his brain before putting any of it

78
00:04:11.381 --> 00:04:14.620
to practical use or building any of the technology.

79
00:04:15.100 --> 00:04:19.240
And it was so successful for him and what I'm suggesting here.

80
00:04:19.240 --> 00:04:19.781
And as I throw up,

81
00:04:19.781 --> 00:04:23.890
some of these quotes is that Tesla had discovered a way as we all actually

82
00:04:23.891 --> 00:04:24.880
naturally are able to do.

83
00:04:24.881 --> 00:04:29.500
We just don't realize it to essentially be dialed in to the universal energies.

84
00:04:29.860 --> 00:04:32.380
That essentially thoughts that come to us.

85
00:04:32.381 --> 00:04:33.820
You ever wonder where those come from.

86
00:04:34.240 --> 00:04:36.880
I have to say that some of the most brilliant ideas I've ever had in my life or

87
00:04:37.030 --> 00:04:40.390
life changing ideas that were for the better seemingly came out of nowhere.

88
00:04:40.391 --> 00:04:41.260
And I can't explain it.

89
00:04:41.620 --> 00:04:45.490
You only have to look at various the most successful songs ever written the most

90
00:04:45.610 --> 00:04:49.270
amazing works of art, other inventions, the most successful CEOs.

91
00:04:49.450 --> 00:04:52.990
Talk about this stuff as well is all about intuition. That essentially,

92
00:04:53.380 --> 00:04:56.080
if you put an a will to something,

93
00:04:56.200 --> 00:05:00.460
it will materialize make no mistake. We as humans are creators.

94
00:05:00.730 --> 00:05:04.600
Now I'm going to pull back a little bit on this conversation and save it for

95
00:05:04.601 --> 00:05:07.600
another video where I could talk about the occult or universal energies.

96
00:05:07.600 --> 00:05:12.400
And that essentially I'm convinced that every one of us has a divine nature to

97
00:05:12.401 --> 00:05:14.290
us. Now, hold on, I'm not talking religion here.

98
00:05:14.740 --> 00:05:19.390
I'm talking about the source of all things and how you can utilize your

99
00:05:19.391 --> 00:05:23.860
powers. Am I say powers like, don't forget you are one's dirt.

100
00:05:24.370 --> 00:05:25.210
And now you're a living,

101
00:05:25.211 --> 00:05:29.170
breathing thing that survives by eating things that grow out of the ground that

102
00:05:29.171 --> 00:05:31.450
were once dirt. And yet you'll be dirt again,

103
00:05:31.720 --> 00:05:35.350
but in the middle of all that you are capable of experiencing love. I mean,

104
00:05:35.351 --> 00:05:38.350
how do you explain love or laughter where do those things fit in for the

105
00:05:38.351 --> 00:05:42.160
strongest survive? I'm convinced I believe in a divineness to everything.

106
00:05:42.550 --> 00:05:46.090
I just don't see it in the same ways that most organized religions explain it

107
00:05:46.091 --> 00:05:50.440
because they're omitting so much truth and they much of religions man-made.

108
00:05:50.441 --> 00:05:52.840
Now I'm not saying that everything you read in the Bible of Grande or anywhere

109
00:05:52.841 --> 00:05:56.560
else, isn't true. I think there's a lot of truth to those two major religions.

110
00:05:57.110 --> 00:06:00.470
But what I'm saying here is that there are more truths out there that we haven't

111
00:06:00.500 --> 00:06:03.230
seemingly discovered yet. I'll say I'll leave it at that.

112
00:06:03.231 --> 00:06:06.590
I'll save more of this for another video, but now let me get onto these quotes.

113
00:06:06.680 --> 00:06:10.190
That will kind of paint you a picture of where I'm going with this. For example,

114
00:06:10.191 --> 00:06:13.610
Tesla said, but instinct is something which transcends knowledge.

115
00:06:13.730 --> 00:06:18.290
We have undoubtedly certain finer fibers that enable us to perceive truth when

116
00:06:18.291 --> 00:06:22.160
logical deduction or any other willful effort of the brain is fetal.

117
00:06:22.490 --> 00:06:25.280
And this is part of the reason why his works were suppressed is that I'm

118
00:06:25.281 --> 00:06:29.660
convinced the powers that be, do understand that intuitions are real thing. Um,

119
00:06:29.750 --> 00:06:33.770
and they don't want everyone to know that they want the masses to be essentially

120
00:06:33.860 --> 00:06:37.730
just sheep that fall in line and don't think for themselves in that creativity.

121
00:06:37.730 --> 00:06:41.510
So that way the powers that be the Illuminati or whatever you want to call them,

122
00:06:42.410 --> 00:06:45.440
uh, can just maximize the experience of their earthly existence.

123
00:06:45.860 --> 00:06:49.610
If you want to find the secrets of the universe, think in terms of energy,

124
00:06:49.640 --> 00:06:53.540
frequency, and vibration guys, this was validated as a research,

125
00:06:53.541 --> 00:06:55.970
a technological capabilities allowed scientists,

126
00:06:55.971 --> 00:06:59.690
modern-day scientists to learn about Adams. That Adam's makeup everything,

127
00:06:59.691 --> 00:07:02.600
whether it be a rock or a pen, this iPad, everything,

128
00:07:02.601 --> 00:07:05.360
nothing solid everything's made up of the finest things.

129
00:07:05.390 --> 00:07:07.910
The smallest things that we know of in the universe, which are atoms,

130
00:07:08.270 --> 00:07:11.330
which have a nucleus and electron and seemingly,

131
00:07:11.331 --> 00:07:14.540
when you have an object like a rock, what you're not aware of,

132
00:07:14.570 --> 00:07:17.690
what you're human eyes don't show you is that most of that rock is actually

133
00:07:17.691 --> 00:07:20.180
hollow. What we perceive as being completely solid,

134
00:07:20.450 --> 00:07:23.360
isn't actually the case as discovered on the atomic level.

135
00:07:23.930 --> 00:07:26.960
So everything is an Adam everything's made up of an energy.

136
00:07:26.961 --> 00:07:29.570
We don't necessarily understand how it works.

137
00:07:29.930 --> 00:07:34.700
Just like say consciousness like scientists agree that consciousness

138
00:07:34.760 --> 00:07:37.700
is a form of energy. They don't understand how it works,

139
00:07:37.820 --> 00:07:40.730
but they all agree that will energy is something that cannot be created or

140
00:07:40.731 --> 00:07:42.470
destroyed, only transformed,

141
00:07:42.560 --> 00:07:46.040
which is another reason why I buy into our divineness and that there's a lot of

142
00:07:46.041 --> 00:07:48.980
things going on behind the scenes that are the veil of the human eyes.

143
00:07:48.981 --> 00:07:52.430
Don't allow us to say, I mean, look, here's another quote.

144
00:07:52.670 --> 00:07:55.790
The gift of mental power comes from God divine being.

145
00:07:55.850 --> 00:07:58.190
And if we concentrate our minds on that truth,

146
00:07:58.220 --> 00:08:00.230
we become in tune with this great power.

147
00:08:00.260 --> 00:08:02.990
Now I'm under the impression that Tesla wasn't actually a religious person,

148
00:08:03.200 --> 00:08:07.310
but yet he did believe that there was some sort of force out there that allowed

149
00:08:07.311 --> 00:08:10.970
us to connect to everything and get us to where we are today and develop things

150
00:08:10.971 --> 00:08:14.090
that we have even Einstein talked about. This people will try and tell you,

151
00:08:14.180 --> 00:08:18.740
oh yeah, Einstein was an atheist. No, he wasn't. He wasn't religious.

152
00:08:19.070 --> 00:08:20.840
But he talked about intuition as well.

153
00:08:20.930 --> 00:08:23.660
And his most famous quotes on that have been suppressed. In fact,

154
00:08:23.661 --> 00:08:25.490
at the beginning of this video, I said, you know,

155
00:08:25.491 --> 00:08:28.190
Tesla being one of the smartest people ever, and a lot of people will disagree.

156
00:08:28.250 --> 00:08:28.970
I'm like, oh no, no, no, no, no.

157
00:08:28.970 --> 00:08:32.030
Einstein of course was the smartest person ever. Well,

158
00:08:32.031 --> 00:08:36.800
look at what Einstein said about Tesla. He wasn't kidding. He really,

159
00:08:36.801 --> 00:08:41.660
truly believed that Tesla was the smartest person in existence yet in school.

160
00:08:41.661 --> 00:08:45.440
I don't remember learning about Tesla even once. Never, ever.

161
00:08:45.441 --> 00:08:49.730
Did I learn about Tesla in school? You have to start adding up. Why is that?

162
00:08:49.940 --> 00:08:53.360
And yet he was able to develop some of the most significant and important

163
00:08:53.361 --> 00:08:57.510
inventions in the history of the world, all by just thinking things up.

164
00:08:58.020 --> 00:09:00.930
If you think it's just because he was smart, he must've had a high IQ guys.

165
00:09:00.931 --> 00:09:01.920
That's not what it is.

166
00:09:02.280 --> 00:09:06.720
Think about how many modern scientists out there don't develop crap and think

167
00:09:06.721 --> 00:09:10.170
about it. Tesla actually spoke about this. In fact, take this quote.

168
00:09:10.171 --> 00:09:11.004
For example,

169
00:09:11.310 --> 00:09:14.670
today scientists have substituted mathematics for experiments and they wander

170
00:09:14.671 --> 00:09:18.090
off through equation after equation and eventually build a structure,

171
00:09:18.091 --> 00:09:20.820
which has no relation to reality. He's not kidding.

172
00:09:21.120 --> 00:09:25.830
Most of the world's smartest people today are not putting their genius to

173
00:09:25.950 --> 00:09:26.820
practical use.

174
00:09:26.850 --> 00:09:31.260
It's the same reason why they can't create incredible inventions the way Tesla

175
00:09:31.261 --> 00:09:34.980
did despite not having the internet and all kinds of other resources.

176
00:09:35.010 --> 00:09:38.820
He used his imagination. Alexander Graham bell talked about this.

177
00:09:38.850 --> 00:09:41.520
Einstein talked about this many, many others,

178
00:09:41.521 --> 00:09:44.760
some of the most significant inventors of all time have spoken about this.

179
00:09:44.761 --> 00:09:47.220
Like I said, CEO's have spoken about this.

180
00:09:47.310 --> 00:09:50.250
Even Donald Trump has spoken about this. And even if you don't like him,

181
00:09:50.370 --> 00:09:51.270
give him some credit.

182
00:09:51.510 --> 00:09:54.210
We're talking about someone who's been enormously successful in his life,

183
00:09:54.690 --> 00:09:57.810
became the president of the United States, despite all the odds against him.

184
00:09:57.990 --> 00:10:00.330
And he has talked about that. Everything changed in his life.

185
00:10:00.450 --> 00:10:02.160
Once he started listening to his instincts,

186
00:10:02.850 --> 00:10:04.560
instincts and intuition is real guys.

187
00:10:04.561 --> 00:10:08.160
And that's the important message behind this video. Tesla was dialed in.

188
00:10:08.161 --> 00:10:12.450
He figured that out. So I hope that this video helps open your mind to see that.

189
00:10:12.451 --> 00:10:15.750
Look, if you trust Tesla, trust your intuition.

190
00:10:15.990 --> 00:10:19.290
It's that first feeling or thought that comes to you. Your thoughts,

191
00:10:19.291 --> 00:10:22.260
everything else like your brain, the human brain will screw you over,

192
00:10:22.500 --> 00:10:24.660
but start researching intuition. It's a real thing.

193
00:10:24.661 --> 00:10:29.520
There are some sort of energies out there that allow us to access

194
00:10:29.521 --> 00:10:33.330
information and it is, well, look,

195
00:10:33.390 --> 00:10:36.300
something big is happening behind the scenes and I'm convinced of it.

196
00:10:36.330 --> 00:10:39.180
So I'm going to close up there. I'm Jimmy,

197
00:10:39.181 --> 00:10:41.910
this is bright insight like and subscribe, help me spread the message.

198
00:10:42.600 --> 00:10:43.470
Take care, everybody.
