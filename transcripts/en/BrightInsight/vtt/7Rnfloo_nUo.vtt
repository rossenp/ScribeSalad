00:00:00.660 --> 00:00:03.200
<v 0>The documentary Blackfish continues to be a success.</v>

2
00:00:03.460 --> 00:00:07.160
It was announced today that SeaWorld parks and entertainment announced an

3
00:00:07.161 --> 00:00:11.440
incredible loss in attendance and revenues for their fourth quarter, 2016,

4
00:00:12.180 --> 00:00:14.200
the revenues are down by tens of millions of dollars.

5
00:00:14.560 --> 00:00:17.640
And their attendance is down by tens of thousands of people in just the last

6
00:00:17.641 --> 00:00:19.600
quarter alone. Make no mistake.

7
00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:24.270
The public is fully aware of what Blackfish exposed and they're completely

8
00:00:24.271 --> 00:00:28.510
disgusted by sea's behavior in attempt to discredit Blackfish by stating that it

9
00:00:28.511 --> 00:00:32.670
has been debunked, that it was misinformation and completely inaccurate. Oh,

10
00:00:32.671 --> 00:00:36.190
really? What part of Blackfish was inaccurate or has been debunked? What,

11
00:00:36.330 --> 00:00:39.830
the fact that they showed a short video clip of orcas being captured in the

12
00:00:39.831 --> 00:00:43.300
wild, in the, just happened to not be of telecom specifically.

13
00:00:43.301 --> 00:00:45.020
So it's been debunked. Uh,

14
00:00:45.080 --> 00:00:50.060
so the rest of us saw that orcas have been proven 100% conclusively to be

15
00:00:50.061 --> 00:00:52.060
sentient beings. They're completely,

16
00:00:52.061 --> 00:00:55.820
self-aware just like humans and that they know that they're being enslaved,

17
00:00:55.821 --> 00:00:57.260
that they know that they're imprisoned.

18
00:00:57.440 --> 00:01:02.010
And you have 'em in a bathtub in a chlorinated swimming pool for their entire

19
00:01:02.011 --> 00:01:04.570
lives to swim around in circles, in a concrete bathtub.

20
00:01:05.120 --> 00:01:06.450
Despite the fact that in the wild,

21
00:01:06.451 --> 00:01:09.490
they travel a hundred miles a day and that's right. It is chlorinated.

22
00:01:09.770 --> 00:01:10.410
Although of course,

23
00:01:10.410 --> 00:01:13.530
SeaWorld will tell you that they use a fraction of the amount of chlorine that

24
00:01:13.531 --> 00:01:16.370
you'll find in a public swimming pool. So of course it's safe.

25
00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:20.610
The masses are awakened and they are trying to send SeaWorld a message by saying

26
00:01:20.611 --> 00:01:21.850
that they don't like your product anymore.

27
00:01:22.310 --> 00:01:26.680
They don't like the fact that you're forcing these sentient beings to do circus

28
00:01:26.860 --> 00:01:28.000
tricks for food.

29
00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:30.560
We don't like the fact that they have been robbed of their families,

30
00:01:30.790 --> 00:01:33.120
that they are being cause incredible suffering,

31
00:01:33.150 --> 00:01:36.760
both physical and psychological because of the treatment that they're receiving

32
00:01:36.761 --> 00:01:37.760
at SeaWorld. Now, hold on,

33
00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:41.880
I know that there's many people that work for SeaWorld trainers, animal lovers.

34
00:01:41.920 --> 00:01:44.670
I know that there's so many people there that love these animals and treat them

35
00:01:44.671 --> 00:01:45.630
to the best of their ability.

36
00:01:45.890 --> 00:01:49.110
But the bottom line is that they are imprisoned and they should be released to

37
00:01:49.111 --> 00:01:52.750
the wild or at least a, a habitat, you know, in some sort of bay or Cove.

38
00:01:52.890 --> 00:01:55.670
And many people have suggested this, but they refuse to do it.

39
00:01:55.890 --> 00:01:56.910
People can't stand.

40
00:01:56.911 --> 00:01:59.670
The thought that the habitat that they're living in now is a fraction of the

41
00:01:59.671 --> 00:02:03.420
size of the parking lots at SeaWorld people can't stand.

42
00:02:03.421 --> 00:02:06.380
The fact that SeaWorld destroyed and discredited,

43
00:02:06.480 --> 00:02:08.620
the loving memory of Don Brando,

44
00:02:08.740 --> 00:02:11.940
a completely beautiful human being and blamed her for her own death,

45
00:02:11.950 --> 00:02:16.140
which is clearly inaccurate. People can't stand the thought that Kelly Clark,

46
00:02:16.400 --> 00:02:20.940
who lied on the stand in a courtroom in order to mitigate a lawsuit that was

47
00:02:20.941 --> 00:02:23.970
happening because of sea's negligence in her death,

48
00:02:24.320 --> 00:02:28.530
that they promoted her to director of training for SeaWorld. Yes, Kelly Clark,

49
00:02:28.531 --> 00:02:31.290
someone who's demonstrated that they're a coverup artist and a liar.

50
00:02:31.430 --> 00:02:33.810
And instead they promote her. It's disgusting.

51
00:02:34.430 --> 00:02:37.010
People have awakened to the fact that they don't like Joel, Mandy,

52
00:02:37.011 --> 00:02:40.890
the CEO of SeaWorld who has gone on an aggressive marketing campaign to try and

53
00:02:40.891 --> 00:02:44.360
discredit black fish and promote the image of SeaWorld, which is job.

54
00:02:44.820 --> 00:02:48.360
Are you aware that Joel Manby his base salary is $1 million a year,

55
00:02:48.540 --> 00:02:49.520
but the year before last,

56
00:02:49.521 --> 00:02:53.760
because he works for a publicly traded company that he made 11.3 million

57
00:02:54.230 --> 00:02:57.360
because you know, bonuses and stock options. Meanwhile,

58
00:02:57.810 --> 00:03:02.600
orcas and dolphins are suffering incredibly in their captivity. The word is out.

59
00:03:03.160 --> 00:03:03.161
The,

60
00:03:03.161 --> 00:03:06.440
there is a global awakening happening where people around the world are figuring

61
00:03:06.441 --> 00:03:09.800
out that the way things have been for the last several decades in this world,

62
00:03:09.980 --> 00:03:13.960
aren't necessarily the best way to go about life that we wanna embrace love in

63
00:03:13.961 --> 00:03:16.720
that we are stewards of this planet as human beings,

64
00:03:16.721 --> 00:03:21.070
that we have special capabilities, but yet we treat orcas as if,

65
00:03:21.090 --> 00:03:22.310
as if they're less, well,

66
00:03:22.311 --> 00:03:26.230
guess what guys the public has shown you and sent you a message that they don't

67
00:03:26.231 --> 00:03:27.190
like your product anymore.

68
00:03:27.530 --> 00:03:30.750
And I suggest that you catch up with the times and do the right thing.

69
00:03:31.470 --> 00:03:33.350
Joel Manby if you really are a good guy,

70
00:03:33.380 --> 00:03:35.550
like you claim to be like you've marketed yourself,

71
00:03:35.551 --> 00:03:39.220
which I'm starting to think was just a gimmick that you've quite literally to a

72
00:03:39.221 --> 00:03:41.660
advantage. And we're able to sell the, the executives,

73
00:03:41.661 --> 00:03:44.940
the board of directors at SeaWorld in order to make a freaking fortune.

74
00:03:45.290 --> 00:03:46.140
Good for you. Right?

75
00:03:46.720 --> 00:03:50.660
How about you do this dump your SeaWorld stocks ensure the release, uh,

76
00:03:50.690 --> 00:03:55.220
into a habitat for the orcas and dolphins and freaking quit and go drive,

77
00:03:55.320 --> 00:03:55.621
you know,

78
00:03:55.621 --> 00:03:58.980
right on jet skis or move to an all inclusive resort for the rest of your life.

79
00:03:58.981 --> 00:04:01.250
Live your life because make no mistake,

80
00:04:01.251 --> 00:04:02.650
you have the power to do the right thing.

81
00:04:03.310 --> 00:04:06.330
How many more millions of dollars do you need to make before you start embracing

82
00:04:06.390 --> 00:04:09.970
the actual love that you preach out about and have written multiple books about,

83
00:04:10.040 --> 00:04:13.330
come on, make no mistake. This trend is never going to stop.

84
00:04:13.400 --> 00:04:16.690
It's only going to accelerate and C world's days are numbered.

85
00:04:17.050 --> 00:04:21.600
I highly suggest that you figure out another main traction to substitute the

86
00:04:21.610 --> 00:04:24.760
orcas and dolphins at your facilities. I don't know, install a roller coaster,

87
00:04:24.900 --> 00:04:28.840
do something else, figure it out because this, your industry is dying.

88
00:04:28.900 --> 00:04:32.040
People don't like it. And it's only going to continue down this path.

89
00:04:32.460 --> 00:04:34.440
So anyways, guys, I'll leave it at that.

90
00:04:34.760 --> 00:04:38.400
I highly recommend that you don't attend any of zero parks and entertainment

91
00:04:38.401 --> 00:04:40.790
facilities, cuz don't forget. It's not just sea world.

92
00:04:40.940 --> 00:04:44.230
It's Bush gardens and many other facilities look them up. You can Google it.

93
00:04:44.231 --> 00:04:47.270
Look at the Wikipedia page. They own dozens of facilities around the country.

94
00:04:48.020 --> 00:04:51.390
Anyways, guys, I'll leave it at that. I'm Jimmy, this is bright insight.

95
00:04:51.470 --> 00:04:52.303
I can subscribe.

96
00:04:52.310 --> 00:04:55.590
I have many other videos for you to enjoy on a whole wide variety of topics.

97
00:04:55.940 --> 00:04:56.670
Take care of everybody.
