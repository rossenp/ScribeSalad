1
00:00:00.750 --> 00:00:04.360
<v 0>President Trump and Pope Francis are meeting for the first time today,</v>

2
00:00:04.500 --> 00:00:07.600
May 23rd, 2017 at the Vatican.

3
00:00:08.100 --> 00:00:11.080
And as the media tries to guess what they're gonna say to each other behind

4
00:00:11.081 --> 00:00:11.914
closed doors.

5
00:00:12.340 --> 00:00:17.000
The real question that I have is what is hidden in the Vatican secret archives.

6
00:00:17.600 --> 00:00:17.881
I mean,

7
00:00:17.881 --> 00:00:22.790
come on 53 miles of shelf space that is limited access and

8
00:00:22.791 --> 00:00:25.990
you can't just even the researchers that are allowed in and I'll get into the

9
00:00:25.991 --> 00:00:29.550
details of that in just a second. Those that are allowed in are just,

10
00:00:29.551 --> 00:00:30.910
they're not allowed to go browsing.

11
00:00:31.020 --> 00:00:34.470
They're only allowed to see the information that they've requested.

12
00:00:34.970 --> 00:00:37.030
And when you have 53 miles of shell space,

13
00:00:37.730 --> 00:00:40.030
one can only imagine what they really have hidden in there.

14
00:00:40.770 --> 00:00:43.980
So who actually allowed within the Vatican secret archives?

15
00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:47.940
Well qualified scholars from institutions of higher education,

16
00:00:48.020 --> 00:00:52.740
pursuing scientific research with an adequate knowledge of archival

17
00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:56.500
research, uh, which I mean, that's ridiculous who in the world, you know,

18
00:00:56.600 --> 00:00:59.660
has fricking experience in archival research anymore.

19
00:00:59.660 --> 00:01:01.780
That's silly may apply.

20
00:01:02.050 --> 00:01:06.890
I for an entry card scholars need an introductory letter by either a recognized

21
00:01:06.891 --> 00:01:10.850
Institute of research or by a suitably qualified person in the field of

22
00:01:10.851 --> 00:01:11.890
historical research,

23
00:01:12.220 --> 00:01:15.450
applicants need to specify their personal name and information,

24
00:01:15.790 --> 00:01:17.730
as well as the purpose of their research.

25
00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:19.970
Undergraduate students are not admitted.

26
00:01:20.620 --> 00:01:24.640
There are strict limitations to what archive users are able to view and access.

27
00:01:25.220 --> 00:01:30.160
For example, no materials dated after 1939 are available for public viewing,

28
00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:31.560
which is interesting by the way,

29
00:01:31.760 --> 00:01:33.640
cuz that's the precise year that world war II started,

30
00:01:34.050 --> 00:01:35.520
which I'll mention later in the video.

31
00:01:36.340 --> 00:01:40.880
Now there are 53 miles or 85 kilometers of shelf space in the library

32
00:01:41.660 --> 00:01:45.990
and you must have a specific request to pursue that specific subject.

33
00:01:46.440 --> 00:01:48.990
There is no browsing permitted whatsoever.

34
00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:54.150
Instead researchers request specific documents using bulky catalogs,

35
00:01:54.151 --> 00:01:57.070
which are usually handwritten in Italian or Latin.

36
00:01:57.610 --> 00:02:00.430
And they can only request up to three folders each day.

37
00:02:00.970 --> 00:02:02.270
If within just a few minutes,

38
00:02:02.271 --> 00:02:05.860
they realize that the information that they're seeking is not in the requested

39
00:02:05.861 --> 00:02:08.460
folders. They're first to pack up for the day,

40
00:02:08.750 --> 00:02:13.380
which is incredibly inconvenient and challenging for researchers and scholars,

41
00:02:13.381 --> 00:02:18.140
because most of them are traveling incredibly long distances just to visit the

42
00:02:18.141 --> 00:02:21.940
Vatican secret archives. No photographs are permitted whatsoever.

43
00:02:21.941 --> 00:02:25.930
However laptops are okay. As long as they're only utilized for note taking.

44
00:02:26.550 --> 00:02:29.610
So just to clarify, there's no browsing whatsoever.

45
00:02:29.910 --> 00:02:33.090
So you're only allowed to research what you know already exists.

46
00:02:33.430 --> 00:02:37.970
So anything else in there that well may not be known to the public is not

47
00:02:38.220 --> 00:02:41.610
accessible whatsoever. I mean, come on. Is that shady or what?

48
00:02:42.230 --> 00:02:46.400
And the fact that you can only request three folders per day with even if in a

49
00:02:46.401 --> 00:02:48.200
couple minutes you realize like, oh I have the wrong folder.

50
00:02:48.320 --> 00:02:50.040
I need the next one over, oh, sorry.

51
00:02:50.060 --> 00:02:53.480
You have to leave for the day and request a new one. That's stupid. And,

52
00:02:53.680 --> 00:02:56.840
and tell me that's not indicative of hiding something of something shady.

53
00:02:57.320 --> 00:02:59.760
I mean, think about that. What are they hiding in there?

54
00:02:59.761 --> 00:03:04.360
We're talking 53 miles of shelf space. Like if I said five miles of shelf space,

55
00:03:04.361 --> 00:03:06.840
you'd be like, oh wow, that's a lot 53 miles.

56
00:03:07.020 --> 00:03:09.680
And you can only request what you know, exists. Give me a break.

57
00:03:10.180 --> 00:03:12.480
Now there's tons of speculation of what they're hiding in there.

58
00:03:12.481 --> 00:03:16.000
Whether it's information about tying the Vatican to Nazi Germany,

59
00:03:16.400 --> 00:03:18.440
cuz there was some shady stuff there, by the way, I mean, come on,

60
00:03:18.730 --> 00:03:23.470
you can't visit or view anything in the archives after 1939, the precise year,

61
00:03:23.630 --> 00:03:24.463
the world war II starts.

62
00:03:24.850 --> 00:03:29.630
And there's already tons of evidence that ties various funding as well as the

63
00:03:29.631 --> 00:03:33.190
Vatican. You know, I'll just leave it at that. I have a lot of questions.

64
00:03:33.250 --> 00:03:34.510
All I know is I don't have all the answers,

65
00:03:34.610 --> 00:03:37.710
but many speculate that there might be some answers related to world war II

66
00:03:37.850 --> 00:03:38.830
within the archive.

67
00:03:39.490 --> 00:03:44.460
There's also a ton of speculation as to what happened to the 14 missing chapters

68
00:03:44.461 --> 00:03:47.660
within the Bible. Apparently. I mean, if you're not aware the Vatican,

69
00:03:47.880 --> 00:03:51.900
the Roman Catholic church absolutely altered the Bible. So did the king Ja,

70
00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:54.420
so did king James, the king James version is altered.

71
00:03:54.920 --> 00:03:56.860
And so the question becomes well, what's original.

72
00:03:56.861 --> 00:04:01.770
What isn't and well does Jesus, as an example, did he,

73
00:04:02.070 --> 00:04:04.810
was he able to write because many theorized that he was able to,

74
00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:09.370
that he was not able to lead the masses in such a way without being educated.

75
00:04:09.450 --> 00:04:11.450
I mean, many people have theorized on this. It's a,

76
00:04:11.451 --> 00:04:13.210
it's a big controversy obviously,

77
00:04:14.030 --> 00:04:16.210
but clearly there's something within the archives.

78
00:04:16.830 --> 00:04:19.370
Now other people have stated that it might involve aliens,

79
00:04:19.371 --> 00:04:23.080
that it might things with, you know, corruption and pornography,

80
00:04:23.081 --> 00:04:26.440
even there's all kinds of speculations. I don't know what's in there.

81
00:04:26.780 --> 00:04:30.080
All I know is that they're hiding something and it's beyond obvious.

82
00:04:30.500 --> 00:04:33.880
Why would they go to such incredible and difficult lengths for people to

83
00:04:34.040 --> 00:04:37.560
research this stuff and make anything that's unknown while unknowable,

84
00:04:38.130 --> 00:04:41.350
think about that guys, a religion with secret, isn't a religion.

85
00:04:41.860 --> 00:04:44.990
It's a control mechanism. I mean, let me give you an example.

86
00:04:45.350 --> 00:04:48.750
I used to go to Sunday school for years and I went to church every Sunday with

87
00:04:48.751 --> 00:04:49.750
my family growing up.

88
00:04:50.570 --> 00:04:54.670
How many Catholics have ever heard of the Peniel gland or the pine cone statue

89
00:04:54.671 --> 00:04:55.630
within the Vatican?

90
00:04:56.190 --> 00:04:59.230
I was never taught of this in Sunday school or ever heard about it in church,

91
00:04:59.770 --> 00:05:03.780
not once ever need. Does anyone else? I know that's Catholic yet.

92
00:05:03.781 --> 00:05:04.581
The Peno gland,

93
00:05:04.581 --> 00:05:08.380
which is the shape of a pine cone is utilized through ancient cultures around

94
00:05:08.381 --> 00:05:10.020
the world, dating back thousands of years,

95
00:05:10.290 --> 00:05:14.940
whether it's the Egyptians with the eye of hos or even the Sumerians or even

96
00:05:15.240 --> 00:05:17.620
Buddhi statues containing the, the pine cone.

97
00:05:17.840 --> 00:05:21.460
And this goes back to even other places as well as you can see here. I mean,

98
00:05:21.570 --> 00:05:25.210
besides the fact that the Vatican has an 11 foot solid bronze statue,

99
00:05:25.280 --> 00:05:28.170
that is 2000 years old, which is pretty unexplainable,

100
00:05:28.171 --> 00:05:30.970
they say it used to be a fountain and it's really mysterious yet.

101
00:05:30.990 --> 00:05:35.450
The Pope in many popes have carried around to staff that has a pine cone on it.

102
00:05:35.930 --> 00:05:38.170
I mean, when you have the Egyptians making a big deal about this,

103
00:05:38.230 --> 00:05:40.250
as well as the Sumerians and by the way,

104
00:05:40.251 --> 00:05:43.840
the Sumerians are allegedly the birthplace of civilization.

105
00:05:44.040 --> 00:05:48.480
I mean most of mathematics dates back to the Sumerians are modern calendar as

106
00:05:48.481 --> 00:05:51.920
well as the first documented language ever written, uh,

107
00:05:51.970 --> 00:05:53.520
dates back to the Sumerians as well.

108
00:05:54.100 --> 00:05:58.320
And somehow the Sumerians knew thousands of years before the first telescope

109
00:05:58.690 --> 00:06:01.760
about detailed information about the planets overriding our son,

110
00:06:02.030 --> 00:06:04.960
such as that the Jupiter was bigger than Saturn and Mars,

111
00:06:04.961 --> 00:06:06.760
smaller than earth and so on. And so on.

112
00:06:06.910 --> 00:06:10.520
They somehow had this information and the Sumerians just so happened to make a

113
00:06:10.521 --> 00:06:13.920
very big deal of the Peno gland. You know, that reminds me,

114
00:06:14.380 --> 00:06:17.310
why did the Vatican establish a telescope? That's right.

115
00:06:17.311 --> 00:06:18.790
The Vatican has their own telescope.

116
00:06:18.860 --> 00:06:22.350
It's located in on the other side of the world in Arizona on mountain Graham.

117
00:06:22.770 --> 00:06:26.030
You can look into this, it's called the Vatican advanced technology telescope.

118
00:06:26.530 --> 00:06:29.630
And although I've tried extensively to figure out what made them wanna build

119
00:06:29.631 --> 00:06:32.710
this in the first place, I can never get a straight answer it to be honest,

120
00:06:32.711 --> 00:06:35.950
it's kind of mysterious. I would like to hear firsthand from the Pope,

121
00:06:36.210 --> 00:06:39.100
why they have is freaking telescope. Now,

122
00:06:39.120 --> 00:06:42.180
as you see this picture here of the Pope, you see the OS in the background,

123
00:06:42.490 --> 00:06:46.420
this is of course located at the Vatican. And as you're aware OSS,

124
00:06:46.421 --> 00:06:49.260
you can find them in ancient Egypt. And it just so happens. I mean,

125
00:06:49.261 --> 00:06:53.580
look at the inscription here, the Egyptians etched in stone, the seeing eye,

126
00:06:53.600 --> 00:06:54.433
the eye of horse,

127
00:06:54.440 --> 00:06:57.930
the same thing that's based off the pan gland and the pine cone at you.

128
00:06:58.430 --> 00:07:00.930
And we also see OS of course in Washington, DC,

129
00:07:01.750 --> 00:07:04.770
as well as in New York Paris London.

130
00:07:05.510 --> 00:07:08.890
And don't forget of the symbolism here. I mean, look at the, as above.

131
00:07:08.950 --> 00:07:12.770
So below symbolism when it comes to the Washington monument water feature or

132
00:07:12.771 --> 00:07:17.370
even the pyramid, as well as the eye on the back of the $1 bill. I mean,

133
00:07:17.371 --> 00:07:19.360
is this all just a coincidence? I mean,

134
00:07:19.361 --> 00:07:21.880
when you have numerous cultures leading back thousands of years,

135
00:07:22.170 --> 00:07:26.720
discussing in depth about the intuitive abilities of P of people that stem from

136
00:07:26.740 --> 00:07:29.200
the Peno gland, which is the shape of a pine cone,

137
00:07:29.630 --> 00:07:33.400
it's time for people to start asking new questions and start challenging the

138
00:07:33.401 --> 00:07:36.160
Vatican to open up the Vatican archives.

139
00:07:36.780 --> 00:07:40.950
It is literally a crime against humanity to have a religious faith

140
00:07:41.140 --> 00:07:43.550
withholding information and, and,

141
00:07:43.790 --> 00:07:47.830
and some sort and documentation dating back thousands of years that of course is

142
00:07:47.831 --> 00:07:49.790
applicable to ancient human civilization.

143
00:07:50.490 --> 00:07:54.510
And these connections that you've seen in this presentation clearly show well

144
00:07:54.511 --> 00:07:58.910
that the powers that be clearly know something that the masses do not anyways

145
00:07:58.990 --> 00:08:01.820
got, is I gonna close up there? I can subscribe, leave me a comment.

146
00:08:01.840 --> 00:08:03.020
Let me know what your thoughts are.

147
00:08:03.220 --> 00:08:05.180
I know this is a touchy subject because it's religion,

148
00:08:05.600 --> 00:08:09.020
but ultimately only the truth will set us free. I'm Jimmy,

149
00:08:09.021 --> 00:08:11.180
this is bright insight. Take care, everybody.
