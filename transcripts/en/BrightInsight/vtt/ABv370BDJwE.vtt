<v 0>Go Beckley Tepe.</v>

2
00:00:02.790 --> 00:00:07.410
The world's oldest and largest megalithic structure ever found is back in the

3
00:00:07.411 --> 00:00:07.720
news.

4
00:00:07.720 --> 00:00:11.810
Like it never has before you may have seen the headlines going all around the

5
00:00:11.811 --> 00:00:12.890
world. In fact,

6
00:00:13.090 --> 00:00:17.250
I would venture to say that every single media outlet on the planet earth has

7
00:00:17.251 --> 00:00:22.240
made an article about this declaring that go Beckley Tepe is temple that

8
00:00:22.241 --> 00:00:25.040
was utilized and created by a skull cult.

9
00:00:25.540 --> 00:00:27.640
And in case you didn't see the thumbnail of this video,

10
00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:31.680
that's what I think about that. And I'm gonna explain exactly why &lt;laugh&gt;,

11
00:00:32.100 --> 00:00:34.480
but first, if you're not familiar with go Beckley Tepe,

12
00:00:34.540 --> 00:00:37.280
let me just share with you a few key points about it. It's in Turkey,

13
00:00:37.870 --> 00:00:42.470
it's dated at 11,600 years old, at least because that was the point in time.

14
00:00:42.630 --> 00:00:44.710
And when it was deliberately buried by humans.

15
00:00:44.810 --> 00:00:46.550
And I'll explain that in just a second,

16
00:00:47.380 --> 00:00:52.190
it's 50 times larger than Stonehenge and nearly 6,000 years older,

17
00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:57.550
it is, it covers an area of 22 acres at least. And they have only excavated,

18
00:00:57.730 --> 00:00:59.470
not even 10% of it.

19
00:01:00.010 --> 00:01:04.380
It has more than 200 pillars that they know of as they verify through ground

20
00:01:04.381 --> 00:01:05.300
penetrating radar.

21
00:01:05.810 --> 00:01:10.300
Many of which are more than 20 feet tall and weigh at least 20 to 30 tons.

22
00:01:10.930 --> 00:01:14.700
What makes it even more interesting is it has sculptures of animals throughout,

23
00:01:14.701 --> 00:01:15.940
which are three dimensional.

24
00:01:16.330 --> 00:01:20.100
They quite literally went the most difficult route possible that instead of just

25
00:01:20.101 --> 00:01:24.490
chiseling away, they chiseled around the area to incredibly high precision.

26
00:01:24.710 --> 00:01:25.531
How did they do that?

27
00:01:25.531 --> 00:01:29.490
Or why did they go to such a great extent to make it that much more precise?

28
00:01:29.750 --> 00:01:33.810
And especially by the way, no one knows who made this it's 12,000 years ago.

29
00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:38.090
Let's not forget that the Sumerians and Mesopotamia are allegedly the birthplace

30
00:01:38.091 --> 00:01:40.890
civilization and that dates back 6,000 years.

31
00:01:41.470 --> 00:01:44.320
So when go Beckley TAPPI was discover 1994,

32
00:01:44.620 --> 00:01:48.480
it completely just astonished archeologists and scientists from around the

33
00:01:48.481 --> 00:01:52.240
world. In that it just completely debunked what we thought we knew about, uh,

34
00:01:52.260 --> 00:01:56.560
the true history of human civilization yet mainstream science has been beyond

35
00:01:56.840 --> 00:02:01.040
hesitant to address the site of go Backley Tappe and to make this site even more

36
00:02:01.041 --> 00:02:05.110
confusing to scientists, it has a celestial orient. In fact,

37
00:02:05.111 --> 00:02:08.550
it is the very first structure in the world to have a perfectly north south

38
00:02:08.830 --> 00:02:12.110
facing structure. And when I say north we're talking true north,

39
00:02:12.160 --> 00:02:15.910
which is more precise than a compass because a compass is affected by magnetic

40
00:02:15.940 --> 00:02:20.830
declination. How in the world did a civilization 12,000 years ago?

41
00:02:21.250 --> 00:02:23.110
How are they able to orient something,

42
00:02:23.270 --> 00:02:27.660
a massive structure of this size or any structure at all to true north?

43
00:02:27.680 --> 00:02:32.460
How were they even able to identify it to quote literally a perfect orientation?

44
00:02:32.860 --> 00:02:33.101
I mean,

45
00:02:33.101 --> 00:02:37.300
what year was it that we were able to establish true north precisely in modern

46
00:02:37.301 --> 00:02:38.134
civilization?

47
00:02:38.560 --> 00:02:41.660
Now let me get back to the sensational headlines that are going all over planet

48
00:02:41.661 --> 00:02:44.860
earth right now scientists have found 408,

49
00:02:44.930 --> 00:02:48.490
eight skull fragments that contain cut marks within them,

50
00:02:48.550 --> 00:02:52.490
as well as some drill holes. Now out of these 408 fragments,

51
00:02:52.840 --> 00:02:56.490
only a few of them actually have any type of cut marks on them whatsoever.

52
00:02:56.670 --> 00:02:59.440
In fact, only enough for three skulls.

53
00:03:00.140 --> 00:03:03.120
That's right out of hundreds of bone fragments, they have found,

54
00:03:03.121 --> 00:03:06.800
they have found an equivalent of three skulls that have cut marks in them and

55
00:03:06.801 --> 00:03:07.634
drill holes.

56
00:03:07.740 --> 00:03:11.720
So they've concluded that the whole area was utilized by a skull cult and it was

57
00:03:11.760 --> 00:03:15.280
a temple. Now I have researched go Beckley. Tappe quite a bit.

58
00:03:15.281 --> 00:03:19.910
So when I first saw this, I instantly had some concern. So I decided to read,

59
00:03:19.940 --> 00:03:22.710
read the fine print, as well as read the actual publication.

60
00:03:23.130 --> 00:03:25.270
And what you'll see here is the low science,

61
00:03:25.870 --> 00:03:29.790
a a a S which stands for the American association for the advancement of

62
00:03:29.791 --> 00:03:32.150
science, which by the way, is the world's largest,

63
00:03:32.340 --> 00:03:35.470
general scientific society of peer. Uh,

64
00:03:35.471 --> 00:03:40.300
peer review journals happens to mention that these skull for fragments only date

65
00:03:40.301 --> 00:03:44.460
back between 10 and 7,000 years, wait a second.

66
00:03:44.461 --> 00:03:46.380
There's a discrepancy there. I mean,

67
00:03:46.381 --> 00:03:49.140
they acknowledge that this site dates back nearly 12,000 years,

68
00:03:49.800 --> 00:03:52.900
but these skull fragments only date back seven to 10,000 years.

69
00:03:53.480 --> 00:03:57.220
And we know through a overwhelming amount of organic material that has been

70
00:03:57.230 --> 00:04:02.010
dated to 11,600 years, which is just universally accepted for the, uh,

71
00:04:02.011 --> 00:04:06.690
timeframe that this site was buried. But now they have skull fragments that are,

72
00:04:06.840 --> 00:04:10.050
that arrived thousands of years later, huh?

73
00:04:10.560 --> 00:04:14.850
They claim that depictions and carvings on these stone pillars, uh,

74
00:04:14.870 --> 00:04:17.410
depict human decapitations of a human skull,

75
00:04:17.830 --> 00:04:19.930
and that these were clearly symbolic of a,

76
00:04:20.160 --> 00:04:24.800
a skull cult and that they must have danged and STR about and hung about skulls,

77
00:04:24.970 --> 00:04:28.320
human skulls, all around the area to, uh, scare away enemies.

78
00:04:28.660 --> 00:04:30.720
That's their hypothesis. However,

79
00:04:30.910 --> 00:04:35.520
this publication completely emits any information whatsoever about the, well,

80
00:04:35.521 --> 00:04:37.440
you may have seen the headlines from April of this year,

81
00:04:37.530 --> 00:04:41.310
where scientists and astronomers and archeologists have pieced together,

82
00:04:41.311 --> 00:04:45.190
various depictions throughout these stone pillars that they suggest actually

83
00:04:45.460 --> 00:04:49.070
depicts a cosmic impact with planet earth. In fact,

84
00:04:49.230 --> 00:04:52.070
they theorize that these depictions are actually of star constellations,

85
00:04:52.200 --> 00:04:56.510
which just so happened to match up perfectly with that frame of time of when the

86
00:04:56.511 --> 00:04:59.870
star constellations would've been in that view and that direction of the sky,

87
00:05:00.080 --> 00:05:00.990
which by the way,

88
00:05:01.220 --> 00:05:06.020
a just so happens to orient itself with the timeframe of when there was a cosmic

89
00:05:06.040 --> 00:05:10.020
impact here on earth, 11,600 years ago, which I'll get into in just one second.

90
00:05:10.480 --> 00:05:11.540
Now, if you're not aware already,

91
00:05:11.560 --> 00:05:13.660
and I've discussed this in numerous other videos,

92
00:05:13.661 --> 00:05:16.020
and I'm working on another video with new information, uh,

93
00:05:16.021 --> 00:05:16.860
that I'm piecing together,

94
00:05:17.440 --> 00:05:20.580
but there was absolutely some sort of cosmic event here on earth,

95
00:05:20.581 --> 00:05:24.090
approximately thousand 600 years ago. And another event

96
00:05:26.090 --> 00:05:27.890
12,980 years ago give or take five years. I mean,

97
00:05:27.891 --> 00:05:31.330
the evidence for this is overwhelming. There is a black mat layer,

98
00:05:31.380 --> 00:05:35.090
which encompasses more than 50 million square kilometers of the Earth's surface.

99
00:05:35.630 --> 00:05:39.530
And it contains nano diamonds, melt glass, extraterrestrial,

100
00:05:39.750 --> 00:05:41.370
helium Iridium,

101
00:05:41.380 --> 00:05:45.080
which by the Iridium and extraterrestrial helium come from outer space.

102
00:05:45.600 --> 00:05:47.480
Iridium is what makes up almost all meteorites.

103
00:05:47.910 --> 00:05:50.600
This just so happens to coincide with the most recent data,

104
00:05:50.630 --> 00:05:54.440
take it from ice core samples from Antarctica in Greenland that showed that

105
00:05:54.441 --> 00:05:56.000
11,600 years ago,

106
00:05:56.001 --> 00:06:00.000
there was a massive rise of global sea levels of more than 400 feet that

107
00:06:00.120 --> 00:06:01.760
happened in a very short period of time.

108
00:06:02.640 --> 00:06:06.080
And that period of time also coincides with a massive extinction event where you

109
00:06:06.081 --> 00:06:10.680
had 75% of all mammals in north America go extinct and it's mysterious.

110
00:06:11.040 --> 00:06:14.360
Scientists have never been to identify why that happened, which by the way,

111
00:06:14.520 --> 00:06:19.190
120 species of mega or animals larger than 100 pounds or

112
00:06:19.191 --> 00:06:22.550
included in that, uh, mass extinction level event. Some of which, by the way,

113
00:06:22.770 --> 00:06:25.670
you've never seen before these animals are incredible looking. I mean,

114
00:06:26.070 --> 00:06:28.030
&lt;laugh&gt; take, for example, the, the short faced bear,

115
00:06:28.031 --> 00:06:31.070
which is humongous or even the giant grounds slot. I mean,

116
00:06:31.071 --> 00:06:33.270
these things are just incredible and most people have never even seen them

117
00:06:33.271 --> 00:06:34.104
before.

118
00:06:34.330 --> 00:06:38.460
So you have all those events that happened approximately 11th in 600 years ago.

119
00:06:38.800 --> 00:06:40.300
And then you have go Beckley Tepe,

120
00:06:40.430 --> 00:06:45.300
which is universally agreed upon to have been buried by humans 11,600 years

121
00:06:45.400 --> 00:06:48.340
ago. The whole site of go Beckley Tepe, which by the way,

122
00:06:48.341 --> 00:06:50.300
in the Turkish language means pot belly pig,

123
00:06:50.301 --> 00:06:54.460
that this is an unusual hill and the entire hill itself is quite literally

124
00:06:54.680 --> 00:06:59.090
gravel stone and rocks that were filled in the quite literally with buckets or

125
00:06:59.091 --> 00:07:00.770
wheelbarrows. I mean, just to paint you a picture,

126
00:07:00.830 --> 00:07:02.730
I'm not suggesting that's what the engines utilized,

127
00:07:03.230 --> 00:07:07.090
but someone people bury this site, they didn't destroy it.

128
00:07:07.090 --> 00:07:08.450
They didn't knock down the pillars. I mean,

129
00:07:08.451 --> 00:07:11.650
surely if they had the capability of lifting these stone pillars, I mean,

130
00:07:11.730 --> 00:07:14.130
I didn't discuss by the way. I mean, how did they cut and carve these stones,

131
00:07:14.250 --> 00:07:17.330
how they lift them 12,000 years ago, that's a holy D whole different, uh,

132
00:07:17.331 --> 00:07:21.680
topic in itself, but primitive methods can accomplish these things. Uh,

133
00:07:21.700 --> 00:07:23.960
so of course they could have just knocked them down, right.

134
00:07:24.220 --> 00:07:26.280
But yet they chose to bury this site.

135
00:07:26.460 --> 00:07:29.000
And when you see these walls that surround, uh,

136
00:07:29.320 --> 00:07:31.080
go back Tapp and also within itself,

137
00:07:31.210 --> 00:07:34.760
these are simply where the archeologists that have conducted the excavations

138
00:07:34.870 --> 00:07:37.800
have simply placed the stones. So these walls that you're seeing here,

139
00:07:37.801 --> 00:07:39.550
that's not the aim ancient walls that they made,

140
00:07:39.790 --> 00:07:41.990
what the site itself is of the stone pillars.

141
00:07:42.290 --> 00:07:44.550
So despite all the most recent data and evidence,

142
00:07:44.710 --> 00:07:47.990
it shows you that there's something massive that happened 11,600 years ago,

143
00:07:48.620 --> 00:07:53.110
science, a a, a S just completely neglects it all together.

144
00:07:54.050 --> 00:07:56.990
Now I've studied the topic of ancient human civilization quite a bit.

145
00:07:56.991 --> 00:08:01.340
And I've observed that quite literally is a massive coverup within

146
00:08:01.350 --> 00:08:04.860
mainstream science regarding the true history of ancient human civilization.

147
00:08:05.200 --> 00:08:08.220
You could say just that maybe a bunch of egos get in the way or that maybe a

148
00:08:08.221 --> 00:08:08.970
bunch of people's.

149
00:08:08.970 --> 00:08:12.540
They have their careers that have been based upon a narrative that well has been

150
00:08:12.541 --> 00:08:15.100
debunked. So the question of why there's a quote,

151
00:08:15.380 --> 00:08:17.340
unquote coverup as I would call it, or as many people have,

152
00:08:17.530 --> 00:08:21.970
have referred to it as that's, that's debatable, let's not get into that.

153
00:08:22.120 --> 00:08:26.810
What I wanna discuss is the relationship between Monsanto and science,

154
00:08:27.130 --> 00:08:29.210
a a a S quite literally,

155
00:08:29.211 --> 00:08:32.610
they have been bought and paid for by Monsanto and the number of articles that

156
00:08:32.611 --> 00:08:36.410
have come out where they defend Monsanto ha is unbelievable. Actually,

157
00:08:36.411 --> 00:08:38.010
there's so many of them, in fact,

158
00:08:38.011 --> 00:08:41.920
so many that even the freaking huffing post made an article about it all

159
00:08:42.120 --> 00:08:46.440
together. So I dug a little bit deeper and I saw that science, a, a,

160
00:08:46.480 --> 00:08:51.360
a S has declared on multiple years that Monsanto has been employer

161
00:08:51.380 --> 00:08:54.720
of the year company of the year leader of innovation and all kinds of other

162
00:08:54.721 --> 00:08:57.960
awards, most of which aren't even included when I check Wikipedia,

163
00:08:57.961 --> 00:09:00.520
which go figure Wikipedia such nevermind on that.

164
00:09:00.521 --> 00:09:03.720
I'll make a video on that all together someday. So where am I going with this?

165
00:09:03.870 --> 00:09:04.460
Well,

166
00:09:04.460 --> 00:09:08.960
why can we trust an organization that has been bought and paid for by a

167
00:09:08.961 --> 00:09:12.680
disgraceful organization or any organization? This is supposed to be science,

168
00:09:12.681 --> 00:09:15.110
which is supposed to be based on yet.

169
00:09:15.111 --> 00:09:18.590
They've clearly been bought and paid for the evidence of this goes far beyond

170
00:09:18.591 --> 00:09:21.550
Monsanto, by the way, dig into this and look into them for yourselves.

171
00:09:22.050 --> 00:09:25.830
But does anyone in the right mind actually think that a,

172
00:09:26.100 --> 00:09:30.190
that a skull cult is who formed this? The site of go Beckley depe,

173
00:09:30.290 --> 00:09:34.790
really a massive site. Like I said, only not even 10% of it has been excavated.

174
00:09:34.910 --> 00:09:39.140
It come covers more than 22 acres. It's 50 times bigger than Stonehenge.

175
00:09:39.370 --> 00:09:43.980
They somehow have the capability of cut and carving these stones in methods, uh,

176
00:09:43.981 --> 00:09:47.620
with three dimensional art. It clearly has a celestial orientation,

177
00:09:47.680 --> 00:09:50.660
and somehow they knew precisely the direction of true north,

178
00:09:50.661 --> 00:09:53.420
which is pretty incredible, but science, a, a,

179
00:09:53.540 --> 00:09:57.250
a S just completely omits and neglects this information altogether.

180
00:09:57.510 --> 00:10:01.050
And instead they come up with, I mean, a skull cult narrative. I mean,

181
00:10:01.070 --> 00:10:05.690
you can just smell the BS here, guys. Am I the only one? I don't know,

182
00:10:05.691 --> 00:10:08.250
this is the reason why some people theorize it perhaps go Beckley.

183
00:10:08.610 --> 00:10:12.850
Tepi maybe a time capsule of some kind that maybe whoever designed this and

184
00:10:12.851 --> 00:10:14.490
created it so many years ago.

185
00:10:14.550 --> 00:10:18.440
So far ago that we have no about it altogether that maybe they want to preserve

186
00:10:18.441 --> 00:10:18.601
it.

187
00:10:18.601 --> 00:10:22.640
So that way civilization moving forward would have a heads up and be able to see

188
00:10:22.980 --> 00:10:27.240
or predict the next CATA event, which we know happens in cycles. And anyways,

189
00:10:27.670 --> 00:10:30.360
I'll leave it at that. I'm Jimmy, this is bright insight.

190
00:10:30.560 --> 00:10:32.840
Like can subscribe and let me comment, let me know what your thoughts are,

191
00:10:33.100 --> 00:10:35.920
but I have many other videos to come on a whole wide variety topics,

192
00:10:36.580 --> 00:10:37.390
take care of everybody.
