00:00:00.690 --> 00:00:04.350
<v 0>So I have a really interesting video for you today,</v>

2
00:00:04.410 --> 00:00:09.150
as I'm going to show you something that very very few people have ever

3
00:00:09.151 --> 00:00:13.380
seen or heard of before, at least not yet. In fact,

4
00:00:13.381 --> 00:00:16.920
I'm going to show you four photos that were sent to me of something that was

5
00:00:16.921 --> 00:00:20.670
recently discovered at a notable ancient Egyptian site,

6
00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:25.290
which for some reason is yet to be shared with the public or make the

7
00:00:25.291 --> 00:00:29.040
headlines. Now, the discovery in itself is fascinating,

8
00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:32.490
but the implications of not only what it is,

9
00:00:32.760 --> 00:00:36.420
but specifically where it is may make your jaw drop.

10
00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:39.930
<v 1>And of course, later in this video, I will be sharing the big,</v>

11
00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:43.710
awkward reason why this hasn't been shared with the public or made the

12
00:00:43.711 --> 00:00:45.630
headlines. And trust me,

13
00:00:45.631 --> 00:00:49.440
when I say that you're going to find that reason disturbing.

14
00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:53.640
Now let me start off by sharing where these four photos were taken,

15
00:00:53.641 --> 00:00:58.530
which just so happens to be at a notable ancient Egyptian site known as the

16
00:00:58.531 --> 00:01:00.000
Dendera complex.

17
00:01:00.540 --> 00:01:03.990
<v 0>This site is known for a few highly recognizable features,</v>

18
00:01:04.380 --> 00:01:07.740
including the massive stone columns that make up the temple of hot tour.

19
00:01:07.800 --> 00:01:11.340
And also the incredibly interesting, and of course,

20
00:01:11.341 --> 00:01:16.110
highly debated hieroglyphs and petroglyphs found throughout this site.

21
00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:20.190
But what if there was something else here that was hidden from everyone,

22
00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:25.380
Egyptologists, archeologists, researchers, something really big.

23
00:01:25.381 --> 00:01:28.500
And although you couldn't say that it was hiding in plain sight,

24
00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:33.210
but what if it was something right under our noses that nobody ever thought to

25
00:01:33.211 --> 00:01:37.980
go looking for? Now? What do I mean by under our noses? Well,

26
00:01:37.981 --> 00:01:41.280
like I mentioned a moment ago, this is the temple of hot tour,

27
00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:45.930
famous for the incredibly large columns and impressive stonework that cover

28
00:01:45.931 --> 00:01:48.480
virtually every inch of every wall,

29
00:01:48.510 --> 00:01:52.680
column and ceiling throughout the temple. In fact,

30
00:01:52.710 --> 00:01:56.850
there are dozens of columns, 24 in total between two hall rooms,

31
00:01:57.240 --> 00:02:00.960
all of which are 15 meters or nearly 50 feet tall.

32
00:02:01.470 --> 00:02:05.910
And the 24 does not include the outside columns that surround the temple.

33
00:02:06.870 --> 00:02:10.950
The decorative work is astounding and full of incredible symbolism.

34
00:02:11.340 --> 00:02:14.910
A trove of knowledge that was communicated and passed down by the ancient

35
00:02:14.911 --> 00:02:19.770
Egyptians thousands of years ago. Now hot tour was the mother of the sun,

36
00:02:19.771 --> 00:02:24.390
God RA and sky God Horus look at the face of how

37
00:02:24.400 --> 00:02:29.130
tour and the late Egyptologists John Anthony West described her interesting

38
00:02:29.131 --> 00:02:33.390
and unusual appearance as a form of symbolism. For example,

39
00:02:33.391 --> 00:02:36.810
her triangular face may have represented the shape of a uterus,

40
00:02:37.050 --> 00:02:41.460
essentially depicting her as the divine feminine also noticed the

41
00:02:41.520 --> 00:02:44.760
ears. Those are certainly not human ears and many,

42
00:02:44.761 --> 00:02:47.730
including John Anthony West stated that they are cow ears,

43
00:02:48.270 --> 00:02:50.790
but why would those have been chosen?

44
00:02:50.940 --> 00:02:55.500
What symbolism are those meant to represent different people have different

45
00:02:55.501 --> 00:02:58.080
thoughts on this. But one thing is for sure,

46
00:02:58.260 --> 00:03:02.770
the appearance and shape of hot tour's face is much different than any depiction

47
00:03:02.771 --> 00:03:06.280
of any famous face depicted by the ancient Egyptians.

48
00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:11.680
And also notice how all of them are defaced. It is not known who did this when,

49
00:03:11.681 --> 00:03:15.550
or for what reasons, but in many ways, this giant temple,

50
00:03:15.551 --> 00:03:19.840
which is literally a building made entirely of stone could be considered a

51
00:03:19.841 --> 00:03:24.580
planetarium of sorts that hot tour represents the cosmic mother,

52
00:03:24.610 --> 00:03:28.750
the mistress of time, astronomical cycles and all cycles of time.

53
00:03:29.410 --> 00:03:32.650
And it's worth mentioning that this temple represents the time of the old

54
00:03:32.651 --> 00:03:37.570
kingdom when Egypt was led by many priestesses and was a matriarch

55
00:03:37.571 --> 00:03:42.130
for a period of time as well. Something few people seem to discuss,

56
00:03:42.131 --> 00:03:43.480
which I find interesting.

57
00:03:44.050 --> 00:03:48.370
Now the ceiling itself ties into the astronomical cycles. I just mentioned.

58
00:03:48.640 --> 00:03:51.280
And in many details, for example,

59
00:03:51.281 --> 00:03:54.400
what you see here is said to represent the waxing of the moon,

60
00:03:54.401 --> 00:03:56.200
which totals 28 days.

61
00:03:56.620 --> 00:04:01.300
So you see 14 gods and goddesses on 14 stairs said to represent the

62
00:04:01.301 --> 00:04:04.810
28 total days that make up the full and new moon cycles.

63
00:04:05.590 --> 00:04:09.730
Another example of the cosmos being represented in this temple includes what is

64
00:04:09.731 --> 00:04:12.190
referred to as the Dendera Zodiac,

65
00:04:12.580 --> 00:04:16.720
which the Egyptians likely took straight from the ancient Sumerian 6,000 years

66
00:04:16.721 --> 00:04:18.670
ago and made it their own.

67
00:04:19.090 --> 00:04:22.510
There are many other fascinating details about what is inscribed on the stone

68
00:04:22.511 --> 00:04:26.650
throughout this temple, but that is not what this video is about. However,

69
00:04:26.651 --> 00:04:29.080
I wanted to share with you the nature of this temple,

70
00:04:29.470 --> 00:04:33.160
that incredible intelligence went into not only constructing it,

71
00:04:33.550 --> 00:04:35.290
which in itself is impressive,

72
00:04:35.320 --> 00:04:38.890
but the thousands of years of learned knowledge that would have went into

73
00:04:38.891 --> 00:04:43.000
developing the information shared within the temple is simply incredible.

74
00:04:43.360 --> 00:04:45.400
But like I said, at the beginning of this video,

75
00:04:45.640 --> 00:04:47.290
what if there was something else here,

76
00:04:47.620 --> 00:04:51.370
something that was hidden from everyone and for thousands of years,

77
00:04:51.610 --> 00:04:52.930
and by the way, if you're not aware,

78
00:04:52.960 --> 00:04:56.410
I recently started an Instagram account a few months ago where I'm sharing more

79
00:04:56.411 --> 00:04:59.920
details about this channel, including clues about my upcoming videos,

80
00:05:00.280 --> 00:05:02.980
as well as I intend to share more information about my personal life.

81
00:05:02.980 --> 00:05:04.420
So you can get to know me a bit better,

82
00:05:04.540 --> 00:05:08.170
but I was very fortunate that an awesome friend named Jamie reached out to me

83
00:05:08.171 --> 00:05:09.160
through Instagram,

84
00:05:09.190 --> 00:05:13.120
having recently returned home from a life-changing trip to visit ancient

85
00:05:13.121 --> 00:05:14.680
Egyptian sites. Back in April,

86
00:05:15.250 --> 00:05:19.300
she had an opportunity to see many things that others traveling and large tour

87
00:05:19.301 --> 00:05:21.130
groups normally do not.

88
00:05:21.520 --> 00:05:26.290
As she traveled with just a few people and hired an experienced Egyptian tour

89
00:05:26.291 --> 00:05:27.100
guide,

90
00:05:27.100 --> 00:05:32.020
a tour guide who had many insider connections with various guards and

91
00:05:32.050 --> 00:05:33.250
Egyptian officials,

92
00:05:33.670 --> 00:05:38.080
and was able to gain access to certain locked doors in exchange for of course,

93
00:05:38.320 --> 00:05:41.830
cash money. So while visiting the temple of hot tour,

94
00:05:41.860 --> 00:05:46.240
Jamie was fortunate enough to see something that was recently uncovered on the

95
00:05:46.241 --> 00:05:48.850
floor of this very temple. Again,

96
00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:53.770
something that only a small number of people have seen or been made aware of.

97
00:05:53.771 --> 00:05:58.220
So without further ado, this is what she was shown,

98
00:05:58.880 --> 00:06:00.290
what you're looking at here,

99
00:06:00.320 --> 00:06:05.270
which has seen with the removal of this large and very heavy floor stone is not

100
00:06:05.300 --> 00:06:07.730
a round stone paver. In fact,

101
00:06:07.760 --> 00:06:12.710
it is the very top of a buried upright stone column,

102
00:06:13.160 --> 00:06:15.770
which appears to be of not just one column,

103
00:06:15.771 --> 00:06:18.650
but multiple upright and buried columns,

104
00:06:18.651 --> 00:06:22.820
which is directly underneath the temple of hot tour.

105
00:06:23.090 --> 00:06:27.560
That's right directly beneath all of this is another temple full of

106
00:06:27.561 --> 00:06:30.470
columns. I did not know how many columns there are,

107
00:06:30.500 --> 00:06:34.580
how tall or wide they are or how widespread the below temple is,

108
00:06:35.060 --> 00:06:38.870
but wow, please leave a comment thinking Jamie,

109
00:06:38.871 --> 00:06:42.920
for these outstanding photos and give this video a thumbs up if you've never

110
00:06:42.921 --> 00:06:46.730
seen or heard of this discovery before, let's get the word out,

111
00:06:47.060 --> 00:06:50.210
but really you would expect to have heard about this discovery from,

112
00:06:50.240 --> 00:06:54.680
I don't know, multinational news outlets, uh, the national geographic,

113
00:06:54.681 --> 00:06:58.070
or maybe just maybe the Egyptian antiquities department,

114
00:06:58.071 --> 00:07:02.630
which of course oversees all of these sites. Now take a look at this diagram,

115
00:07:02.660 --> 00:07:07.040
which shows you the specific location within the temple that has this missing

116
00:07:07.041 --> 00:07:09.560
floor stone and the multiple buried columns.

117
00:07:09.590 --> 00:07:12.020
But speaking of this missing floor stone,

118
00:07:12.021 --> 00:07:16.580
which was only removed in the first place in order to conduct restorations on

119
00:07:16.581 --> 00:07:19.640
it, which was apparently within just the last few months,

120
00:07:20.060 --> 00:07:24.320
and this is of course how they came to discover these columns in the first

121
00:07:24.321 --> 00:07:28.850
place. And by the way, is this actually multiple buried columns?

122
00:07:28.880 --> 00:07:31.880
Or is this just one massive one with unique shape? I mean,

123
00:07:31.970 --> 00:07:36.800
real quick compare to the shape of the columns that we do see inside this temple

124
00:07:37.190 --> 00:07:41.030
and notice the similarity. I'm not exactly sure what to make of this.

125
00:07:41.031 --> 00:07:43.760
And I'm curious to know what your thoughts are in the comments,

126
00:07:44.270 --> 00:07:49.220
but the question becomes how tall are these buried columns? How many are there?

127
00:07:49.340 --> 00:07:53.750
How big is the Berry temple down below and what is waiting to be discovered

128
00:07:53.751 --> 00:07:56.300
inside of it? So let's get this straight,

129
00:07:56.360 --> 00:07:58.490
the already incredible site of hot tour,

130
00:07:58.491 --> 00:08:01.670
which contains a wealth of information about our ancient past.

131
00:08:02.330 --> 00:08:06.380
Just so happens to be sitting on top of a long, lost, buried temple.

132
00:08:06.890 --> 00:08:09.890
And nobody knows what's waiting to be discovered in it.

133
00:08:10.550 --> 00:08:15.290
And the people running the show haven't made the public aware of it yet. Hmm.

134
00:08:15.650 --> 00:08:20.180
So this is the part involving why you haven't heard about this fascinating,

135
00:08:20.181 --> 00:08:20.991
and by the way,

136
00:08:20.991 --> 00:08:25.820
significantly important discovery yet the private guide informed

137
00:08:25.850 --> 00:08:30.350
Jamie that they will be covering it back up and we'll wait to excavate it

138
00:08:30.470 --> 00:08:32.840
once they can do so in secret,

139
00:08:33.260 --> 00:08:36.350
those were his exact words. That's right.

140
00:08:36.770 --> 00:08:40.730
The guide himself said that they will conceal it and we'll be excavating it

141
00:08:40.731 --> 00:08:44.180
without the public's knowledge at an unknown time in the future,

142
00:08:44.480 --> 00:08:48.920
which I assume means that the wait until more broad restorations are required at

143
00:08:48.921 --> 00:08:53.510
the site when they can lock it down for extended periods of time.

144
00:08:53.900 --> 00:08:58.290
These photos literally prove that the authorities overseeing these ancient sites

145
00:08:58.560 --> 00:09:03.030
are actively preventing new found information from reaching the masses.

146
00:09:03.960 --> 00:09:08.790
Think about that. This info isn't being shared with professors, archeologists,

147
00:09:09.690 --> 00:09:09.700
Egyptologists,

148
00:09:09.700 --> 00:09:14.130
or researchers that people with control over these sites have reason to do the

149
00:09:14.131 --> 00:09:16.740
things that they do on their own in secret,

150
00:09:17.100 --> 00:09:20.550
before sharing whatever they decide to share with the public.

151
00:09:20.820 --> 00:09:23.370
Am I the only one that sees a major issue with this?

152
00:09:23.550 --> 00:09:28.260
And by the way of all places that this very temple happens to be at is a

153
00:09:28.261 --> 00:09:33.210
site where some of the most debated stone reliefs from anywhere in ancient times

154
00:09:33.990 --> 00:09:38.670
exists such as that, which is commonly referred to as the Dendera light bulb.

155
00:09:39.090 --> 00:09:43.140
Look at this thing and tell me it doesn't make your eyebrow go up.

156
00:09:43.170 --> 00:09:47.070
Now I've done quite a bit of research on this and read and listen to many

157
00:09:47.071 --> 00:09:51.000
different perspectives from both the mainstream academic explanation,

158
00:09:51.360 --> 00:09:54.630
to those who suggest that this is evidence of ancient technology. Now,

159
00:09:54.960 --> 00:09:59.280
the academic perspective on this is that the Lotus flower depicts the God Horus

160
00:09:59.430 --> 00:10:02.250
emerging from the blooming flower at the beginning of the day.

161
00:10:02.640 --> 00:10:05.670
And the energy of Horace is represented by the snake.

162
00:10:06.390 --> 00:10:10.320
Now that part about the snake supposedly depicting Horace would seem like a

163
00:10:10.321 --> 00:10:10.830
stretch,

164
00:10:10.830 --> 00:10:15.390
but also keep in mind that the stone facing this one shows Horace and the snake

165
00:10:15.391 --> 00:10:19.230
together, which is why they say the snake in this picture represents Horace.

166
00:10:19.770 --> 00:10:20.970
Assuming you buy into that.

167
00:10:21.030 --> 00:10:25.590
Now the bulb part of it is said to depict the sanctuary of the sun or rather the

168
00:10:25.591 --> 00:10:29.910
birthplace of our son, perhaps symbolism of our atmosphere that protects us.

169
00:10:30.540 --> 00:10:34.830
The supporting Jed pillars below are following the sky on its nightly journey.

170
00:10:35.190 --> 00:10:38.580
And the people below are said to be celebrating the new sun as it journeys

171
00:10:38.581 --> 00:10:41.400
across the new sky, essentially being born,

172
00:10:41.730 --> 00:10:45.030
which is why many believe this represents the story of creation.

173
00:10:45.480 --> 00:10:48.210
Now I have a few thoughts of my own on this.

174
00:10:48.211 --> 00:10:51.930
And I must say that the explanations of that this is symbolic of essentially

175
00:10:51.931 --> 00:10:56.520
creation is actually highly compelling based on other examples of symbolism at

176
00:10:56.521 --> 00:10:57.540
hot tourists temple.

177
00:10:57.960 --> 00:11:01.110
I highly recommend you research this on your own and develop your own

178
00:11:01.111 --> 00:11:05.040
conclusions. But it seems to me that this is probably not a light bulb,

179
00:11:05.070 --> 00:11:09.510
but I also think that this may well represent great knowledge and

180
00:11:09.511 --> 00:11:12.960
perhaps of the use of this knowledge in the form of energy.

181
00:11:13.320 --> 00:11:17.880
Hear me out as there's a few details that many people who are convinced that

182
00:11:17.881 --> 00:11:21.450
this thing is strictly symbolic and has absolutely nothing to do with technology

183
00:11:21.990 --> 00:11:25.770
seem to overlook. Let's look to the right of this,

184
00:11:26.040 --> 00:11:28.320
the hieroglyphs themselves give warning.

185
00:11:28.620 --> 00:11:32.340
But the question is warning to what now look at this figure,

186
00:11:32.341 --> 00:11:35.250
which almost looks like the body of a baboons,

187
00:11:35.280 --> 00:11:39.840
except the tail is much different than that of a baboon and the face seems to

188
00:11:39.841 --> 00:11:42.780
look like, I don't know, a toad or a frog of some kind,

189
00:11:43.320 --> 00:11:45.930
this is beyond unusual and get this.

190
00:11:46.200 --> 00:11:50.160
This is literally the only place throughout anywhere in ancient Egypt,

191
00:11:50.310 --> 00:11:53.220
that this being, whoever it is has been found,

192
00:11:53.710 --> 00:11:57.550
this is the one and only example. Interesting.

193
00:11:57.551 --> 00:12:02.140
And I do like the points made by authors, Brian Forester and Stephen mailer,

194
00:12:02.380 --> 00:12:06.760
and the explanation of this and that look at how it's holding two knives.

195
00:12:07.360 --> 00:12:11.920
Could this be symbolic that this knowledge could be used for good or bad

196
00:12:12.250 --> 00:12:14.680
that it could be used to improve life or harm you?

197
00:12:14.710 --> 00:12:18.580
Because after all that is certainly an accurate way of describing electricity,

198
00:12:18.640 --> 00:12:22.240
it can cook your dinner, heat, your house, or electrocute you to death.

199
00:12:22.600 --> 00:12:26.320
It has to be mentioned that the depictions of snakes literally represent energy

200
00:12:26.321 --> 00:12:30.250
and most all ancient civilizations, including Kundalini energy.

201
00:12:30.730 --> 00:12:33.940
Now I'm not saying that this is necessarily to pixel electricity at all.

202
00:12:33.941 --> 00:12:35.560
And again, I doubt that it's a light bulb,

203
00:12:36.220 --> 00:12:41.170
even though it's surely looks like a light bulb, but whether it is or isn't,

204
00:12:41.350 --> 00:12:44.950
is it really that L out of the realm of possibilities that we don't fully

205
00:12:44.951 --> 00:12:48.550
understand the meaning or the context of this? I mean,

206
00:12:48.551 --> 00:12:52.930
any honest and informed researcher would say yes to that as even in modern

207
00:12:52.931 --> 00:12:57.730
times, you can't report on any story without people coming to totally different

208
00:12:57.731 --> 00:12:58.600
conclusions,

209
00:12:59.140 --> 00:13:03.370
but not only that many people that identify with the mainstream academic

210
00:13:03.371 --> 00:13:07.540
narrative of its symbolism all seem to have different differing,

211
00:13:07.580 --> 00:13:11.050
nuanced versions of it. It's actually a bit inconsistent,

212
00:13:11.051 --> 00:13:15.880
which is odd for people claiming to know exactly what it is now many,

213
00:13:15.881 --> 00:13:20.260
see this and consider that the Lotus flower seems to be connected by a cord to

214
00:13:20.261 --> 00:13:24.220
the box down below on the right guys. Again, research this on your own.

215
00:13:24.221 --> 00:13:27.250
There are many logical explanations that have nothing to do with technology,

216
00:13:27.760 --> 00:13:31.420
but if there was one point I would make about all of this,

217
00:13:31.510 --> 00:13:36.130
besides that there is a warning given on the rights of this depiction,

218
00:13:36.131 --> 00:13:39.850
which doesn't seem to belong there with the story and symbolism of creation.

219
00:13:39.850 --> 00:13:42.490
I mean, really why is there a warning for this? Clearly,

220
00:13:42.491 --> 00:13:46.450
there's more to interpret in the details here that most seem to overlook,

221
00:13:47.020 --> 00:13:50.770
but I do have specific questions as to what's referred to as the Jed,

222
00:13:51.310 --> 00:13:53.890
the Jed is supposed to symbolize stability,

223
00:13:53.920 --> 00:13:58.360
but more specifically it is said to represent the spinal cord of the God. Oh,

224
00:13:58.370 --> 00:13:59.203
Cyrus.

225
00:13:59.890 --> 00:14:04.210
Although I can understand it's symbolizing stability in certain examples,

226
00:14:04.630 --> 00:14:08.950
there are other examples that tell me it's something far more specific. I mean,

227
00:14:08.951 --> 00:14:13.450
just look at this and tell me how you could conclude that this represents the

228
00:14:13.451 --> 00:14:17.560
God of Cyrus's spinal cord. Plus if you look closely,

229
00:14:17.680 --> 00:14:22.000
it's almost like a two-pronged fork at the top, this is something very unique,

230
00:14:22.001 --> 00:14:24.970
and I questioned its true meaning and certain examples.

231
00:14:25.390 --> 00:14:27.550
And there are many other interesting depictions of this,

232
00:14:27.551 --> 00:14:31.420
but it's examples like this that suggests that we don't fully understand the

233
00:14:31.421 --> 00:14:35.890
meaning and context. And by the way, as far as stability goes,

234
00:14:36.310 --> 00:14:40.180
pillars and columns certainly provides stability, which is what this looks like.

235
00:14:40.181 --> 00:14:41.800
It looks like an oddly shaped pillar,

236
00:14:42.310 --> 00:14:46.900
but what's particularly interesting is that this is literally nothing like any

237
00:14:46.901 --> 00:14:49.600
other Egyptian made column or pillar ever found.

238
00:14:49.990 --> 00:14:52.040
They just don't look like at all.

239
00:14:52.820 --> 00:14:56.960
The Jed interpretation came from an English man named Wallace budge a hundred

240
00:14:56.961 --> 00:14:57.800
years ago,

241
00:14:58.100 --> 00:15:02.300
who is notable for translating the Egyptian book of the dead budge stated that

242
00:15:02.301 --> 00:15:06.830
originally of Cyrus was probably represented by the Jed alone and that he had no

243
00:15:06.831 --> 00:15:09.620
other form, just this pillar thing.

244
00:15:10.370 --> 00:15:14.540
He regards the Jed hieroglyph as a conventional representation of a part of his

245
00:15:14.541 --> 00:15:19.010
spinal column and gives its meaning as quote, to be stable,

246
00:15:19.190 --> 00:15:23.510
to be permanent abiding established, firmly enduring.

247
00:15:23.990 --> 00:15:27.830
I have to say that. I think that there's more to that story than just that.

248
00:15:28.130 --> 00:15:30.710
Leave a comment and share what your thoughts are on all of that.

249
00:15:30.711 --> 00:15:35.630
But one thing that I'm very curious about is this other highly

250
00:15:35.631 --> 00:15:39.740
unusual stone relief that is right next to this light bulb. I mean,

251
00:15:39.741 --> 00:15:43.670
just look at it, those unique faces with the cow ears,

252
00:15:44.120 --> 00:15:48.170
what exactly is connected to their head? I mean, honestly,

253
00:15:48.230 --> 00:15:50.990
this is some weird stuff and I sense that it's true.

254
00:15:50.991 --> 00:15:54.620
Meaning goes far beyond the explanation that this half circular thing at the

255
00:15:54.621 --> 00:15:58.730
bottom is a monotony necklace, which well, yes it is.

256
00:15:59.120 --> 00:16:03.590
But what is the meaning of this necklace and what is its place in this

257
00:16:03.591 --> 00:16:08.390
particular stonework? Why is it connected to multiple strange looking heads?

258
00:16:08.870 --> 00:16:11.450
Meaning and contexts are beyond significant.

259
00:16:11.451 --> 00:16:14.690
And here we are now thousands of years later trying to interpret what they were

260
00:16:14.691 --> 00:16:15.560
trying to tell us.

261
00:16:15.710 --> 00:16:20.390
So it's more than reasonable to say that we probably are mixing some accurate as

262
00:16:20.391 --> 00:16:24.500
well as some inaccurate information and coming to conclusions. I mean,

263
00:16:24.530 --> 00:16:28.250
my ultimate conclusion is that we don't ultimately fully understand the meaning

264
00:16:28.251 --> 00:16:32.810
of it. And it's foolish for anyone to say that they have at 100% figured out.

265
00:16:33.200 --> 00:16:35.090
What I know is that I don't know,

266
00:16:35.240 --> 00:16:38.720
but this is a fun conversation regardless of what you think it is because here

267
00:16:38.721 --> 00:16:42.410
we are, we're discussing it and it's not being forgotten. And as well,

268
00:16:42.411 --> 00:16:45.560
it's being brought to new eyes that have never seen or heard of this before,

269
00:16:45.590 --> 00:16:47.720
which by the way, I mean this whole site in itself,

270
00:16:47.721 --> 00:16:50.930
the Dendera complex and these incredibly interesting hieroglyphs,

271
00:16:50.931 --> 00:16:53.330
as well as the temple of hot tour and those massive columns,

272
00:16:53.630 --> 00:16:56.150
most people have never even seen or heard of this stuff before,

273
00:16:56.360 --> 00:16:59.930
as it's simply not included in most curriculum for ancient studies. I mean,

274
00:16:59.931 --> 00:17:03.980
they teach you about the Spanx and the pyramids and mummies and king tot. Right.

275
00:17:04.460 --> 00:17:07.250
But have you seen about this when you were in school? I mean,

276
00:17:07.251 --> 00:17:10.130
have you ever seen these things before? I know I wasn't taught about this stuff,

277
00:17:10.400 --> 00:17:11.450
but all of that said,

278
00:17:11.451 --> 00:17:15.710
here we are now with the knowledge that there is a completely hidden temple,

279
00:17:15.830 --> 00:17:20.630
just waiting to be discovered at this very site who knows what is buried

280
00:17:20.631 --> 00:17:23.540
down there or engraved on the Stonewall is within it.

281
00:17:23.990 --> 00:17:27.650
And for a site that is already so impressive and debatable,

282
00:17:27.980 --> 00:17:31.820
the fact that this recent discovery is being kept from the masses really makes

283
00:17:31.821 --> 00:17:35.390
you think again, a special thank you to my friend, Jamie,

284
00:17:35.391 --> 00:17:37.580
for sending me these outstanding photos,

285
00:17:37.581 --> 00:17:41.060
but you will all be thrilled to hear that there are other photos that she sent

286
00:17:41.061 --> 00:17:45.500
me that are behind closed and locked doors and gates at various

287
00:17:45.501 --> 00:17:46.670
Egyptian sites.

288
00:17:47.180 --> 00:17:51.420
And it is truly interesting what they don't want everyone to see on these tour

289
00:17:51.421 --> 00:17:55.950
groups. So look forward to an excellent video with those photos soon.

290
00:17:56.310 --> 00:17:57.570
So to close all this up,

291
00:17:57.630 --> 00:18:01.590
despite all of the disagreements between various academic researchers or

292
00:18:01.591 --> 00:18:03.360
so-called fringe researchers,

293
00:18:03.361 --> 00:18:06.060
or even those that think that aliens built the pyramids.

294
00:18:06.390 --> 00:18:10.350
The one thing that we all have in common is the fact that we have all been left

295
00:18:10.351 --> 00:18:11.880
in the dark about this discovery.

296
00:18:12.030 --> 00:18:15.210
It's time that everyone that shares the unique passion for our ancient history

297
00:18:15.211 --> 00:18:18.450
to unite and come together and realize that, Hey,

298
00:18:18.600 --> 00:18:20.370
we're not being fed the whole story.

299
00:18:20.371 --> 00:18:23.340
And if there's one thing that we all have in common is that we want to know what

300
00:18:23.341 --> 00:18:25.440
the truth is, right? And without a doubt,

301
00:18:25.470 --> 00:18:28.710
all of us want to know what the story is of these buried columns.

302
00:18:29.190 --> 00:18:32.610
Why were they buried in the first place and what is waiting to be seen down

303
00:18:32.611 --> 00:18:36.480
below anyways, guys, I'm going to wrap it up here, but leave a comment.

304
00:18:36.510 --> 00:18:39.450
Let me know what your thoughts are on all of this hit the like button and

307
00:18:44.760 --> 00:18:48.240
Look forward to a great video coming soon. But yeah, I'm Jimmy,

308
00:18:48.241 --> 00:18:50.460
this is bright insight. Take care, everybody.
