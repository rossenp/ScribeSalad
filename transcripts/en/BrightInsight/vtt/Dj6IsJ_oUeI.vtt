1
00:00:02.040 --> 00:00:04.490
<v 0>Wait a second. So 54 years later,</v>

2
00:00:04.660 --> 00:00:07.570
after the assassination of president John F. Kennedy,

3
00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:12.730
they're still not releasing all the files do not be misled by this word

4
00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:17.650
addresses. Uh, nobody is or was asking for any addresses.

5
00:00:17.950 --> 00:00:21.130
All you have to do is look at the details, which is that the FBI,

6
00:00:21.510 --> 00:00:24.400
the C I a and other unnamed agencies.

7
00:00:24.460 --> 00:00:29.160
Let me guess the NSA deemed that this information was sensitive to

8
00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:30.440
national security.

9
00:00:30.500 --> 00:00:34.200
<v 1>So the question becomes who on earth are they protecting?</v>

10
00:00:34.400 --> 00:00:37.840
Whose identity nevermind the addresses 54 years later.

11
00:00:38.300 --> 00:00:40.480
Do you wanna know whose name is in there?

12
00:00:40.600 --> 00:00:44.910
I guarantee it George H w Bush that's right.

13
00:00:45.050 --> 00:00:47.590
Former president and former CIA director.

14
00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:51.910
Who's already been linked years ago through a declassified document that shows

15
00:00:51.911 --> 00:00:55.310
that he was involved in the investigation of JFK,

16
00:00:55.311 --> 00:00:59.190
which of course he denied and said that it must be a different George Bush and

17
00:00:59.191 --> 00:01:00.910
years later when questioned about it again,

18
00:01:00.911 --> 00:01:02.950
he refused to comment on it entirely.

19
00:01:03.320 --> 00:01:07.860
<v 0>And although George HW Bush would become the director of the CIA 13 years after</v>

20
00:01:08.200 --> 00:01:11.900
the death of JFK at the time of JFK's death,

21
00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:15.620
he was indeed a top level CIA agent. In fact,

22
00:01:15.970 --> 00:01:19.020
even briefing president Dwight Eisenhower who have of course,

23
00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:20.700
was the president before JFK.

24
00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:24.410
So you need taken into account that he's already been linked to the invest that

25
00:01:24.530 --> 00:01:25.171
he was a top official,

26
00:01:25.171 --> 00:01:28.690
which obviously anyone investigating the death or homicide,

27
00:01:28.910 --> 00:01:32.930
the assassination of a sitting president would be assigned to top level

28
00:01:32.931 --> 00:01:37.690
officials, which he was, he denied it. And here we are, 54 years later,

29
00:01:38.150 --> 00:01:38.983
and the CIA,

30
00:01:39.230 --> 00:01:43.210
the FBI and other agencies consider it critical to national security.

31
00:01:43.600 --> 00:01:48.160
This in itself is a complete admission of a coverup. Think about it.

32
00:01:48.350 --> 00:01:52.360
Someone who was a president and the director of the CIA would have incredible

33
00:01:52.361 --> 00:01:55.920
knowledge and information that the general public would not have.

34
00:01:56.140 --> 00:01:56.973
And for some reason,

35
00:01:57.350 --> 00:01:59.760
they still don't want the general public to have all the information.

36
00:02:00.300 --> 00:02:04.990
If you're not aware, George H w Bush south is rapidly de to are rating.

37
00:02:05.290 --> 00:02:08.510
If you haven't heard, there are rumors going around that his mind is going,

38
00:02:08.700 --> 00:02:11.230
that he has become senile. He's saying weird things,

39
00:02:11.250 --> 00:02:12.510
and he's not completely coherent.

40
00:02:12.930 --> 00:02:15.470
So considering the fact that he was the director of the CIA,

41
00:02:15.500 --> 00:02:18.550
just imagine what he knows, even more things than presidents know,

42
00:02:19.050 --> 00:02:20.110
and he's going Sile,

43
00:02:20.520 --> 00:02:23.670
isn't it possible that they're afraid he might say something. I mean,

44
00:02:23.671 --> 00:02:27.780
just look at the unusual coincidence of the timing of the fact that they were

45
00:02:27.781 --> 00:02:32.220
gonna withhold these names and addresses to the precise timing of these

46
00:02:32.330 --> 00:02:34.940
groping and sexual misconduct allegations made against them.

47
00:02:34.960 --> 00:02:39.660
Is it possible that the powers that be one who burden and stressed the mind

48
00:02:39.840 --> 00:02:43.780
of an old man in order to prevent him from saying something related to the JFK

49
00:02:43.940 --> 00:02:46.690
incident, or maybe it it's a threat, maybe they're afraid.

50
00:02:46.690 --> 00:02:48.210
He might say something on his deathbed,

51
00:02:48.211 --> 00:02:50.890
knowing that he is rapidly deteriorating. Now,

52
00:02:50.891 --> 00:02:53.690
obviously that's just conjecture and speculation on my behalf,

53
00:02:54.150 --> 00:02:57.650
but the powers that be have been indeed protecting the Bush family for far

54
00:02:57.651 --> 00:03:00.560
longer than most people are aware of take Prescot Bush.

55
00:03:00.700 --> 00:03:04.920
The father of George H w Bush and the grandfather of George w and Jeb,

56
00:03:05.210 --> 00:03:09.480
which many people are not aware was a founding director of the union banking

57
00:03:09.550 --> 00:03:10.383
corporation,

58
00:03:10.570 --> 00:03:15.400
which literally funded the United States and the Nazis during world war II,

59
00:03:16.190 --> 00:03:19.950
literally funding both sides, which has to be the most sinister thing possible.

60
00:03:20.170 --> 00:03:23.390
So that way you win and make a fortune no matter who loses.

61
00:03:24.010 --> 00:03:26.910
And despite this being in violation of trading with the enemy act,

62
00:03:27.320 --> 00:03:30.790
absolutely nothing happened to him. And less than 10 years later,

63
00:03:31.170 --> 00:03:33.030
he would become a United States Senator,

64
00:03:33.450 --> 00:03:37.190
but do not be fooled by these headlines that say he assisted Hitler's rise to

65
00:03:37.191 --> 00:03:39.620
power and make you think that, oh, maybe they,

66
00:03:39.780 --> 00:03:43.140
they gave him money and loan to money in the thirties before world war II. No,

67
00:03:43.141 --> 00:03:47.180
no, no, no. They were doing business and funding the Nazis into October of

68
00:03:47.380 --> 00:03:51.860
19 42, 3 years after Hitler invaded Poland and started world war II.

69
00:03:52.120 --> 00:03:56.180
And he got off the hook completely gave birth to a child who become CIA

70
00:03:56.500 --> 00:03:57.020
director,

71
00:03:57.020 --> 00:04:00.850
a president who would give birth to a child who'd become pro president whose

72
00:04:00.851 --> 00:04:02.410
other son was trying.

73
00:04:02.720 --> 00:04:05.770
It's like seemingly the powers to be were trying to force him into the white

74
00:04:05.771 --> 00:04:06.000
house,

75
00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:09.850
despite overwhelming public dissent and having no interest in Jeb Bush becoming

76
00:04:09.851 --> 00:04:11.690
the president. We all saw what happened there. Now,

77
00:04:11.691 --> 00:04:13.650
if you're wondering what this has to do with the JFK's death,

78
00:04:13.750 --> 00:04:17.930
I'm priming your brain for the information that you're about to get never mind

79
00:04:17.931 --> 00:04:21.640
all the conspiracy theories as they've been involving the grassy Nole,

80
00:04:22.100 --> 00:04:23.800
the fence, the storm drain,

81
00:04:24.440 --> 00:04:27.640
and various theories on who a second gunman could have been because all those

82
00:04:27.641 --> 00:04:31.880
things are debatable. Look at the evidence that we Don know, which is positive,

83
00:04:32.190 --> 00:04:34.720
that there was a coverup take. For example,

84
00:04:35.140 --> 00:04:39.200
the so-called stretcher bullet that was found on the gurney of governor Conley,

85
00:04:39.201 --> 00:04:43.070
which of course was injured in assassination event of JFK.

86
00:04:43.340 --> 00:04:46.710
This bullet went through two people, a neck and two bones,

87
00:04:47.010 --> 00:04:48.950
and somehow it was miraculously untouched.

88
00:04:48.951 --> 00:04:52.270
And when you compare the same bullet to other bullets found in this event,

89
00:04:52.610 --> 00:04:56.470
you can see the dramatic difference. And if you're not familiar with ballistics,

90
00:04:57.150 --> 00:04:59.150
well, bullets are made of lead, which is very mallable.

91
00:04:59.151 --> 00:05:02.300
And even when you shoot them into water, look at the incredible damage.

92
00:05:03.040 --> 00:05:06.180
And they want us to believe that somehow this bullet was found on a stretcher

93
00:05:06.770 --> 00:05:11.220
with zero damage and zero blood on it at all. In other words,

94
00:05:12.060 --> 00:05:14.620
somebody planted it who had access to that hospital.

95
00:05:15.440 --> 00:05:20.260
And we know now that George H w Bush was involved in this investigation and

96
00:05:20.261 --> 00:05:24.330
denied it a top level CIA agents. So this is the part where a lot of people,

97
00:05:24.360 --> 00:05:28.410
even though approximately seven outta 10 Americans is convinced of a coverup and

98
00:05:28.411 --> 00:05:31.090
a second gunman, many other people don't buy into it, cuz they're like,

99
00:05:31.250 --> 00:05:33.410
wha why would the government kill their own president?

100
00:05:33.640 --> 00:05:34.810
They just don't think it's possible.

101
00:05:35.070 --> 00:05:39.330
So let me get into that and start off by showing you what Dwight Eisenhower the

102
00:05:39.331 --> 00:05:40.770
president right before JFK,

103
00:05:41.310 --> 00:05:46.160
his very speech before leaving the white house was literally about outing the

104
00:05:46.320 --> 00:05:47.520
military industrial complex.

105
00:05:47.950 --> 00:05:51.760
That various powers that are able to remain anonymous in the intelligence

106
00:05:51.761 --> 00:05:56.680
community were able to seize power that far exceeded the constitution and

107
00:05:56.681 --> 00:05:58.040
the powers of the presidency.

108
00:05:58.310 --> 00:06:01.760
That was his very last speech before leaving the white house. Yet,

109
00:06:01.761 --> 00:06:05.440
most people are completely unaware that JFK made a speech just three months into

110
00:06:05.441 --> 00:06:06.840
his presidency, just three months,

111
00:06:06.900 --> 00:06:09.840
not even after Dwight Eisenhower speech and in the speech.

112
00:06:09.840 --> 00:06:12.040
He discusses secret societies and the very grave,

113
00:06:12.041 --> 00:06:15.600
danger and ambitions for those who want increased security.

114
00:06:15.740 --> 00:06:19.030
And this ties right into the reason or E motive,

115
00:06:19.310 --> 00:06:22.550
a significant motive of why the powers that be and the intelligence communities

116
00:06:22.670 --> 00:06:26.950
or the military industrial complex would wanna kill JFK take, for example,

117
00:06:27.410 --> 00:06:28.430
the Cuban missile crisis,

118
00:06:29.610 --> 00:06:33.510
all the intelligence officials and chief of staff wanted to launch and go

119
00:06:33.670 --> 00:06:36.190
straight to war with Cuba. JFK did not go along with it.

120
00:06:36.191 --> 00:06:37.860
He showed restrain and he made the right decision.

121
00:06:38.200 --> 00:06:41.940
And this is the part where it gets really disturbing declassified documents that

122
00:06:41.941 --> 00:06:46.020
most people are completely unaware of prove that the United States government

123
00:06:46.210 --> 00:06:51.100
conspired to commit a false flag attack to blame on Cuba in

124
00:06:51.101 --> 00:06:54.220
order to implement a full fledged invasion of the country.

125
00:06:54.810 --> 00:06:59.810
They even discussed blowing up a drum own airliner and faking it to look like

126
00:06:59.811 --> 00:07:00.970
the Cubans had shot it down.

127
00:07:01.200 --> 00:07:04.450
They discussed blowing up a war inside Guantanamo bay.

128
00:07:04.800 --> 00:07:09.770
They discussed lobbying mortars into Guantanamo Bay's base itself and blaming it

129
00:07:09.771 --> 00:07:10.571
all on the Cubans.

130
00:07:10.571 --> 00:07:14.530
And they even outline how they could utilize the casualty list in newspapers to

131
00:07:14.531 --> 00:07:19.320
grow indignation from the American public to so port this war and you can press

132
00:07:19.321 --> 00:07:22.400
pause and look at other other tactics that they were investigating.

133
00:07:22.790 --> 00:07:23.623
This is real.

134
00:07:23.980 --> 00:07:28.480
And just look at the date on that less than a year after JFK said it would

135
00:07:28.481 --> 00:07:30.720
happen. So here's the part that you really need to know.

136
00:07:31.820 --> 00:07:35.040
JFK signature was the only one left that was required in order to implement this

137
00:07:35.041 --> 00:07:39.390
plan. He refused. So the second most likely re involves Vietnam.

138
00:07:40.150 --> 00:07:42.510
Although JFK did send troops and at the time of his death,

139
00:07:42.760 --> 00:07:46.870
there was approximately 16,000. He refused to do a full fledged invasion,

140
00:07:46.940 --> 00:07:49.510
like the powers that B wanted to. And you can see here,

141
00:07:49.970 --> 00:07:54.150
JFK died towards the end of 1963. And just over a year later,

142
00:07:54.151 --> 00:07:57.550
that number would grow exponentially and even more in the years following.

143
00:07:57.730 --> 00:08:02.060
But what 99% of an Americans I would venture to say have no idea is that it has

144
00:08:02.061 --> 00:08:06.860
been proven through declassified documents verified by report from the NSA

145
00:08:07.730 --> 00:08:09.220
that the Gulf of Tonkin incident,

146
00:08:09.221 --> 00:08:14.100
which involved an attack on us warships from the north Vietnamese

147
00:08:14.880 --> 00:08:18.380
was completely a staged false flag event that did not happen.

148
00:08:18.980 --> 00:08:23.210
And the utilize it as an excuse for Congress to vote for war on the resolution

149
00:08:23.950 --> 00:08:28.650
to completely invade that country. And that happened in August of 1964,

150
00:08:28.960 --> 00:08:32.210
less than 11 months after the assassination of JFK,

151
00:08:32.590 --> 00:08:36.290
the president who refused to fully invade Vietnam. This is real.

152
00:08:36.440 --> 00:08:38.050
This is verifiable. Yes,

153
00:08:38.270 --> 00:08:42.640
the United States government's excuse for invading Vietnam was made up

154
00:08:43.260 --> 00:08:44.760
and all the documents prove this.

155
00:08:45.180 --> 00:08:48.680
And 99% of the public has no idea and it gets even worse.

156
00:08:49.420 --> 00:08:54.200
Did you know that Richard Nixon it's been proven decades later and a low LBJ

157
00:08:54.201 --> 00:08:57.600
thought this the entire time in the American public was completely unaware that

158
00:08:57.601 --> 00:09:01.440
Richard Nixon and his quest to become president literally spent money and bribe

159
00:09:01.441 --> 00:09:05.720
various Vietnamese officials in order to postpone the Paris peace talks,

160
00:09:05.721 --> 00:09:08.800
which would of course end the conflict or roar, I should say in Vietnam,

161
00:09:09.500 --> 00:09:12.960
all you ever hear about is Richard Nixon being tricky. Dick in Watergate,

162
00:09:13.520 --> 00:09:14.440
bugging the hotel rooms of a,

163
00:09:14.510 --> 00:09:16.670
his political opponents to get himself an advantage.

164
00:09:17.180 --> 00:09:21.830
When all this time it was known that he literally sabotaged the Paris peace

165
00:09:21.920 --> 00:09:24.030
talks in order. So he could get credit.

166
00:09:24.180 --> 00:09:27.830
When he became president for ending the war and being like, look, I'm the hero.

167
00:09:28.060 --> 00:09:28.740
Meanwhile,

168
00:09:28.740 --> 00:09:32.750
more than 20,000 people were killed and who knows how many injured while those

169
00:09:32.751 --> 00:09:34.870
peace talks were delayed? Just like I mentioned,

170
00:09:35.020 --> 00:09:38.300
the video prior to this one where I say that the mainstream media is complicit

171
00:09:38.301 --> 00:09:40.380
in coverups in manipulation of information.

172
00:09:40.970 --> 00:09:43.820
Just look at the date that the New York times covered this story,

173
00:09:44.760 --> 00:09:47.940
new year's Eve, probably the least watched news day of the year.

174
00:09:47.941 --> 00:09:50.900
And people are only the only thing they're watching is times square and the ball

175
00:09:51.140 --> 00:09:54.420
dropping. Do you see what I'm talking about here? The coverup is real.

176
00:09:55.120 --> 00:09:59.050
The United States government plotted a false flag attack to go to Cuba.

177
00:09:59.550 --> 00:10:03.970
Unsuccessfully because JFK said no, JFK said no to a full scale invasion,

178
00:10:04.400 --> 00:10:05.290
less than a year later,

179
00:10:05.800 --> 00:10:10.530
they literally voted to go invade Vietnam based on a false flag

180
00:10:10.531 --> 00:10:12.450
attack that never happened. And they knew it.

181
00:10:12.710 --> 00:10:16.400
And this is a hundred percent verifiable declassified documents per of this

182
00:10:16.980 --> 00:10:21.680
99%. Again, like I say, probably maybe 98 have no idea.

183
00:10:22.660 --> 00:10:24.880
The truth is stranger than fiction. Guys. I'm not kidding.

184
00:10:24.881 --> 00:10:26.520
When I say that this is real.

185
00:10:26.780 --> 00:10:30.720
So when you consider that someone or multiple people are still alive,

186
00:10:31.030 --> 00:10:35.520
that have some sort of information that's critical to national security is still

187
00:10:35.521 --> 00:10:39.870
being withheld 54 freaking years after the assassination of JFK.

188
00:10:40.660 --> 00:10:41.830
What does that tell you?

189
00:10:42.420 --> 00:10:47.230
When you look at the incredible coincidence of timing involving the George HW

190
00:10:47.231 --> 00:10:48.750
Bush groping allegations to this,

191
00:10:48.751 --> 00:10:52.230
when you consider the fact that he is obviously a person of incredible knowledge

192
00:10:52.231 --> 00:10:55.750
and information that the general public does not have just from being a CIA

193
00:10:55.751 --> 00:10:58.300
agent and president, and that his mind is going,

194
00:10:58.520 --> 00:11:01.060
and you start connecting the dots and all these possibilities,

195
00:11:01.480 --> 00:11:06.060
it becomes abundantly clear that this guy is somebody that knows far more about

196
00:11:06.061 --> 00:11:09.140
the death of JFK than the American public. So why on earth?

197
00:11:09.141 --> 00:11:11.620
Is this a national security issue? Well,

198
00:11:11.621 --> 00:11:15.100
let's see if the American public found out that a former president and CIA

199
00:11:15.380 --> 00:11:20.090
director was involved somehow in some way in the death or coverup of JFK,

200
00:11:20.880 --> 00:11:22.530
there's your national security concern,

201
00:11:22.531 --> 00:11:25.090
because we already know that the various powers that we have been protecting

202
00:11:25.091 --> 00:11:28.650
this family far longer than most people watching this have even been alive.

203
00:11:29.360 --> 00:11:30.890
Guys, the truth is stranger than fiction.

204
00:11:31.430 --> 00:11:35.210
If you support my ambitions to expose truth, like subscribe, leave a comment.

205
00:11:35.270 --> 00:11:37.130
All those things will boost the algorithms on this video.

206
00:11:37.150 --> 00:11:41.120
And I also have a page Trion account helps support me in my quest to expose the

207
00:11:41.121 --> 00:11:44.120
truth and awaken the masses and whatever the best ways that I can.

208
00:11:44.121 --> 00:11:47.200
But I'll wrap up there. I'm Jimmy, this is bright insight.

209
00:11:47.870 --> 00:11:48.640
Take care of everybody.
