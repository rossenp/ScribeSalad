00:00:00.190 --> 00:00:04.040
<v 0>What you're looking at here is definitive evidence of lost ancient high</v>

2
00:00:04.041 --> 00:00:06.720
technology known as the colos of mem.

3
00:00:07.050 --> 00:00:10.840
These two statues are located in L Egypt. However,

4
00:00:11.110 --> 00:00:15.520
each of them were carved out of one solid piece of courtside stone,

5
00:00:15.730 --> 00:00:20.240
which originally weighed approximately 1000 tons, a piece,

6
00:00:20.660 --> 00:00:22.630
however, being cut and carved,

7
00:00:22.631 --> 00:00:26.350
they are estimated at 720 tons a piece. Now,

8
00:00:27.290 --> 00:00:31.350
the fact they're made out of court site is unbelievable because that is a seven

9
00:00:31.590 --> 00:00:35.030
outta 10 on the most scale of hardness with a diamond being a 10.

10
00:00:35.570 --> 00:00:39.150
Now most megalithic structures around Egypt and elsewhere around the world are

11
00:00:39.151 --> 00:00:41.380
carved out of granite or bus salt,

12
00:00:41.630 --> 00:00:44.700
which basalt is approximately a six outta 10 on the most scale.

13
00:00:45.080 --> 00:00:47.420
And granite varies between six, six and a half,

14
00:00:47.421 --> 00:00:49.420
depending on the type of granite now,

15
00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:53.780
how they were able to cut and carve this stone is a complete mystery after all

16
00:00:53.781 --> 00:00:58.620
modern day Egyptologists claim that the DACs Egyptians utilize stone hammers and

17
00:00:58.621 --> 00:01:00.980
bronze chisels to cut and carve stone.

18
00:01:01.240 --> 00:01:04.850
How that's completely impossible with this type of stone,

19
00:01:05.150 --> 00:01:07.410
as well as GRA and Baal as well. However,

20
00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:10.730
many people have proposed different methods that could have been utilized,

21
00:01:10.930 --> 00:01:14.770
although very primitive to cut and carve different types of stone in the

22
00:01:14.771 --> 00:01:18.650
megalithic structures as seen commonly around Egypt, including the pyramids.

23
00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:21.970
However, I'm yet to see any of these methods done on court.

24
00:01:22.460 --> 00:01:25.000
Now that's not to say it's not possible. However,

25
00:01:25.660 --> 00:01:28.760
the size of these statues is astounding.

26
00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:32.720
And to think that they would've used those primitive type methods on something

27
00:01:32.721 --> 00:01:36.200
this large, I consider to be incredibly unlikely.

28
00:01:36.700 --> 00:01:40.200
Now what's interesting about these two stone statues being made at a court site

29
00:01:40.420 --> 00:01:44.910
is that the closest area in the region they could came from is more than 420

30
00:01:44.911 --> 00:01:49.190
miles away, nearly 700 kilometers in modern day chiro,

31
00:01:49.240 --> 00:01:53.510
where there is a quarry that was known and proven to be utilized by the DACs

32
00:01:53.511 --> 00:01:56.470
Egyptians for various statues in other stone structures.

33
00:01:56.770 --> 00:01:57.870
So the question becomes,

34
00:01:58.290 --> 00:02:02.910
how on earth were they able to move something so massive? Now,

35
00:02:03.260 --> 00:02:06.220
if they were moved before they were cut carved, like I said, a thousand tons,

36
00:02:06.340 --> 00:02:09.420
a piece as they stand now, 720 tons,

37
00:02:09.880 --> 00:02:14.420
and you only have to look at what it took in 2012 for the Los Angeles county

38
00:02:14.421 --> 00:02:17.540
museum of the arch to move a 340 ton stone.

39
00:02:17.890 --> 00:02:21.180
They had to custom build a 295 foot long,

40
00:02:21.440 --> 00:02:26.410
196 wheel em national truck to move something that was half

41
00:02:26.411 --> 00:02:27.610
the weight of these statues.

42
00:02:27.990 --> 00:02:31.130
And almost a third of the weight of what these stones would've been prior to

43
00:02:31.131 --> 00:02:35.290
being cut and carved many Egyptologists theorized that different stone blocks.

44
00:02:35.510 --> 00:02:38.010
For example, utilized in the construction of the pyramids.

45
00:02:38.011 --> 00:02:40.770
Would've been moved over tree trunks. However,

46
00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:45.800
that is completely unrealistic when you consider something this big and massive

47
00:02:46.110 --> 00:02:50.280
over that far of a distance. In fact, if you research the Colossian me,

48
00:02:50.500 --> 00:02:53.960
you'll see that there's virtually zero explanation into how these were cut and

49
00:02:53.961 --> 00:02:56.760
carved now to many people at a first glance,

50
00:02:56.830 --> 00:02:58.920
besides the fact that these are incredibly huge.

51
00:02:59.430 --> 00:03:03.480
They're obviously incredibly damaged. However, upon a closer inspection,

52
00:03:03.540 --> 00:03:07.680
you can see that there's incredible high precision that was utilized in various

53
00:03:07.850 --> 00:03:11.200
areas of these statues prior to being destroyed. Now,

54
00:03:11.201 --> 00:03:14.680
whether they were destroyed by people after some sort of war who knows,

55
00:03:15.140 --> 00:03:19.710
but there is evidence that has been discovered by professional GE that they have

56
00:03:19.711 --> 00:03:21.710
been heat blasted in some way.

57
00:03:22.230 --> 00:03:26.070
And some theorized that they may have been subjected to a plasma blast from the

58
00:03:26.071 --> 00:03:27.950
sun tens of thousands of years ago,

59
00:03:28.600 --> 00:03:32.750
which further validate the theory that the dynastic Egyptians did not create

60
00:03:32.751 --> 00:03:36.190
these statues and that they found them and that the human civilization that

61
00:03:36.191 --> 00:03:40.700
existed before the great cataly that had happened 12 to thousand 980 years ago,

62
00:03:40.940 --> 00:03:45.140
would've had some sort of advanced high technology and even look at this photo

63
00:03:45.170 --> 00:03:48.860
here where you can see that the base, although taller than most people,

64
00:03:49.570 --> 00:03:53.460
most of that base is still buried under the ground. The base themselves though,

65
00:03:53.461 --> 00:03:57.660
however, are more than 400 tons a piece. Look,

66
00:03:57.661 --> 00:03:59.140
guys what we were taught in school.

67
00:03:59.240 --> 00:04:01.250
And they were actively teaching in school today.

68
00:04:01.310 --> 00:04:06.210
And in the textbooks is clearly inaccurate in that there's so many holes in the

69
00:04:06.211 --> 00:04:08.170
theories that modern day Egyptologists have,

70
00:04:08.400 --> 00:04:12.730
that it's completely impossible for these statues and many other examples of

71
00:04:12.731 --> 00:04:16.690
megalithic structures around Egypt and elsewhere around the world to have been

72
00:04:16.691 --> 00:04:20.840
done by the primitive methods that have been stated. And by modern day,

73
00:04:20.841 --> 00:04:25.160
Egyptologists definitely check out my video about the ancient cataly as there's

74
00:04:25.161 --> 00:04:26.000
definitive evidence,

75
00:04:26.001 --> 00:04:29.480
that there was a massive catastrophe on planet earth that reset human

76
00:04:29.481 --> 00:04:34.080
civilization nearly 13,000 years ago. Anyways, guys, I'm Jimmy,

77
00:04:34.150 --> 00:04:36.720
this is bright insight. Like can subscribe, help me spread the message,

78
00:04:37.390 --> 00:04:38.280
take care of everybody.
