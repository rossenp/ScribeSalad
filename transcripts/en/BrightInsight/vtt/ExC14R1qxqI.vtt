1
00:00:01.330 --> 00:00:03.030
<v 0>So this channel is about spreading truth.</v>

2
00:00:03.310 --> 00:00:04.950
I also talk about ancient civilization.

3
00:00:05.230 --> 00:00:06.590
Talk about all kinds of different things in this channel.

4
00:00:07.310 --> 00:00:08.230
When I'm about to share with you,

5
00:00:09.630 --> 00:00:12.390
thet de Ching is absolutely worth your time and real quick,

6
00:00:12.391 --> 00:00:15.150
before we press the back button thinking, oh wait, this is a video about a book.

7
00:00:15.170 --> 00:00:17.470
How lame? No, no, no. This is worth your time.

8
00:00:18.180 --> 00:00:21.030
It's the best 5 99 I've ever spent in my life on Amazon.

9
00:00:21.560 --> 00:00:23.260
And it's 81 chapters long.

10
00:00:23.261 --> 00:00:23.760
<v 1>However,</v>

11
00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:27.460
you can read it in 20 minutes because like most chapters are quite literally

12
00:00:27.461 --> 00:00:31.460
this long. The longest is this long, nothing exceeds one page.

13
00:00:32.080 --> 00:00:34.940
And it's so much fricking truth. When you read it,

14
00:00:34.941 --> 00:00:38.900
you just know it's like the gospel, so to speak &lt;laugh&gt;. But, uh, yeah,

15
00:00:38.901 --> 00:00:42.090
there's a lot of mystery behind this book. No one knows who wrote it or when,

16
00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:45.450
other than that, it originates thousands of years ago in China.

17
00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:49.890
<v 0>And it makes many mentions throughout the chapters about the ancients and how</v>

18
00:00:49.891 --> 00:00:52.050
they knew the way and that, and that being said,

19
00:00:52.290 --> 00:00:53.850
that be that's the title of the book.

20
00:00:54.350 --> 00:00:57.170
It means the book of the way or the book of the way of virtue.

21
00:00:57.990 --> 00:01:00.650
And there's a bunch of a different interpretations for this book.

22
00:01:00.651 --> 00:01:03.760
You find different authors because they've spent so much time just trying to

23
00:01:03.761 --> 00:01:08.080
decipher it, trying to translate it and interpret it. So without further ado,

24
00:01:08.081 --> 00:01:09.200
I'm gonna read eight passages.

25
00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:12.400
And I know that sounds lame with someone reading a book on YouTube video,

26
00:01:12.401 --> 00:01:13.240
like how dumb is that?

27
00:01:13.241 --> 00:01:16.920
But they're super quick and it'll paint you a picture to what the book's about

28
00:01:16.921 --> 00:01:20.600
and hopefully encourage you to go buy it because quite literally,

29
00:01:20.830 --> 00:01:24.030
this entire Fri the human race would improve overnight.

30
00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:28.990
If everybody read this especially world leaders. So let me skip. I'm gonna,

31
00:01:28.991 --> 00:01:32.950
I'll read the very last chapter first 81, which is titled true words.

32
00:01:33.130 --> 00:01:36.110
You probably can't see that. So let me just get into it to get an idea.

33
00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:40.630
True words are often unpleasant pleasant words are often untrue.

34
00:01:41.200 --> 00:01:45.460
Those who know the truth, do not argue those who argue, do not know the truth.

35
00:01:46.180 --> 00:01:51.060
Scholars are seldom the wisest men and wise men are seldom scholars.

36
00:01:51.550 --> 00:01:53.820
Those who steal from others, impoverished themselves.

37
00:01:54.150 --> 00:01:58.060
Those who give to others become rich. Those who fight do not win.

38
00:01:58.630 --> 00:02:03.300
Those who win, do not fight. This is the way of the towel. That's the last one.

39
00:02:03.301 --> 00:02:05.130
Let me see, skip over to 11,

40
00:02:05.740 --> 00:02:09.970
which is immateriality immateriality did I say that right? Yes. All right.

41
00:02:10.450 --> 00:02:14.490
A wheel may have 30 spokes, but its usefulness lies in the empty hub.

42
00:02:15.170 --> 00:02:18.890
A jar is formed from clay, but its usefulness lies in the empty center.

43
00:02:19.570 --> 00:02:20.850
A room is made from four walls,

44
00:02:21.310 --> 00:02:26.240
but its usefulness lies in the space between in the same way matter is

45
00:02:26.241 --> 00:02:27.480
necessary to give form.

46
00:02:27.940 --> 00:02:31.400
But the value of reality lies in its immateriality.

47
00:02:31.870 --> 00:02:34.280
That is everything that lives has a physical body,

48
00:02:34.940 --> 00:02:38.920
but the value of life is measured by the soul. Yeah.

49
00:02:38.980 --> 00:02:42.160
You hear me talk about different spiritual things on this channel and uh,

50
00:02:42.270 --> 00:02:46.110
that ties right into it. Let me skip to full, which is non-existence,

51
00:02:46.240 --> 00:02:48.430
which is the short, like a very short one. All right, here we go.

52
00:02:49.250 --> 00:02:51.830
The towel seems to be non-existent yet.

53
00:02:51.831 --> 00:02:56.390
It is essential heaven and earth and everything in them are produced from

54
00:02:56.391 --> 00:02:57.224
existence.

55
00:02:57.530 --> 00:03:02.460
But existence comes from non-existence think about that. Uh,

56
00:03:02.461 --> 00:03:05.180
it's kind of a mind. &lt;laugh&gt; uh, and like I said,

57
00:03:05.181 --> 00:03:06.500
you could read this whole book in 20 minutes,

58
00:03:06.880 --> 00:03:09.620
but I would encourage you to spend a little bit longer so you can reflect on the

59
00:03:09.621 --> 00:03:11.140
passages, but I'm gonna keep going.

60
00:03:11.340 --> 00:03:13.300
Cause I just wanna paint you a picture here and encourage you to get it.

61
00:03:13.301 --> 00:03:17.060
So 42 yin and yang, the tower produces unity.

62
00:03:17.820 --> 00:03:22.730
Unity produces duality, duality produces Trinity. Trinity produces all things.

63
00:03:23.590 --> 00:03:24.490
All things contain,

64
00:03:24.491 --> 00:03:28.250
both the negative principle yin and the positive principle yang.

65
00:03:29.110 --> 00:03:31.930
The third principle, energetic vitality Chi,

66
00:03:32.020 --> 00:03:35.690
which I've talked about energy and U source energy, which is a,

67
00:03:35.890 --> 00:03:40.160
a video coming that I'm gonna make very soon. Um, makes them harmonious.

68
00:03:40.570 --> 00:03:45.080
There are some things which it is a gain to lose and a loss to gain.

69
00:03:45.750 --> 00:03:47.560
This may not be what they teach in school,

70
00:03:48.060 --> 00:03:52.000
but is the first lesson in learning the towel. Pretty interesting.

71
00:03:52.001 --> 00:03:56.480
When you think about that 1 57 freedom. This one's a little bit longer.

72
00:03:56.750 --> 00:03:59.950
Yeah. Look how long that is. &lt;laugh&gt; it's worth a it though.

73
00:04:00.010 --> 00:04:02.510
The empire is administered with righteousness.

74
00:04:02.730 --> 00:04:06.830
The army is directed by strategy that people are best ruled by giving them

75
00:04:06.831 --> 00:04:10.070
freedom. How do I know this is? So by the towel,

76
00:04:10.770 --> 00:04:15.350
the more restrictions and prohibitions there are the poorer people become the

77
00:04:15.351 --> 00:04:18.230
more soldier, the more soldiers patrol the streets,

78
00:04:18.450 --> 00:04:21.900
the more the city is in disorder. The more the city is in disorder.

79
00:04:22.400 --> 00:04:26.580
The more officials are crafty and cunning. The harder the people are to control.

80
00:04:27.160 --> 00:04:31.580
The more laws and orders are issued. The more thieves are and robbers abound.

81
00:04:32.240 --> 00:04:35.620
The wise ruler says, if I am practice or excuse me,

82
00:04:35.720 --> 00:04:38.740
if I practice restraint, the people will reform themselves.

83
00:04:39.520 --> 00:04:44.130
If I love peace that people will become peaceful. If I am not greedy,

84
00:04:44.430 --> 00:04:46.170
the people will become prosperous.

85
00:04:46.510 --> 00:04:50.330
If I practice simplicity that people will become simple, like amen.

86
00:04:50.331 --> 00:04:52.530
Like you could see this going on in our society. Guys,

87
00:04:52.850 --> 00:04:54.090
you can see it happening all around the world.

88
00:04:54.091 --> 00:04:55.530
There is a lot of fricking truth to that.

89
00:04:55.600 --> 00:04:58.970
When you see just how big governments have become and the consequences behind

90
00:04:58.971 --> 00:05:03.120
them, all right guys, I'm almost done. Let me share 71, which is ignorance.

91
00:05:03.121 --> 00:05:07.720
This one's fantastic to know that there are some things that you cannot know

92
00:05:08.060 --> 00:05:09.040
is mental health.

93
00:05:10.140 --> 00:05:14.080
Not to know things that you ought to know is illness.

94
00:05:14.860 --> 00:05:17.400
The wise man recognizes the limits of his knowledge.

95
00:05:18.100 --> 00:05:21.400
The foolish man thinks he knows everything. Oh a man.

96
00:05:21.740 --> 00:05:23.230
It's not until you run a YouTube channel,

97
00:05:23.231 --> 00:05:25.430
you'll see some of the comments you get. And you're like, oh my God,

98
00:05:25.860 --> 00:05:28.470
like people think they know everything. Everyone thinks they know everything.

99
00:05:28.790 --> 00:05:30.990
Well, not everyone enlightened people like whoever wrote this,

100
00:05:31.560 --> 00:05:34.110
truly understand it. All right. Just two more guys. I'm wrapping this up.

101
00:05:34.420 --> 00:05:38.070
75 oppression when taxes are excessive.

102
00:05:38.370 --> 00:05:41.950
The people starve when officials are metal sum,

103
00:05:42.380 --> 00:05:46.220
the people rebel when governments make life burden burdensome,

104
00:05:46.740 --> 00:05:51.340
the people do not fear. Death oppression never achieves its intended results.

105
00:05:52.630 --> 00:05:55.380
Isn't that right? Very true. All right guys, last one.

106
00:05:55.381 --> 00:05:58.080
Number 78 paradoxal truth.

107
00:05:58.990 --> 00:06:02.800
Nothing is gentler than water yet. Nothing can withstand its force.

108
00:06:03.520 --> 00:06:08.200
Likewise, nothing compares to the towel by it. The weak defeat,

109
00:06:08.260 --> 00:06:13.000
the strong, the flexible conquer. The rigid. Everyone knows this is true,

110
00:06:13.740 --> 00:06:15.520
but how few put it into practice?

111
00:06:16.510 --> 00:06:20.670
Priests are often the worst sinners government officers are often the worst

112
00:06:20.950 --> 00:06:24.630
criminals. The truth is often paradoxal. Again,

113
00:06:25.060 --> 00:06:28.830
this is the TA Daun. I highly recommend it.

114
00:06:28.970 --> 00:06:31.270
My most favorite passages in there are chapters.

115
00:06:31.271 --> 00:06:32.390
I didn't read just cuz they're a bit longer.

116
00:06:32.391 --> 00:06:35.150
And I know how lame it is to hear someone read on a YouTube video.

117
00:06:35.290 --> 00:06:38.740
So anyways guys, I'm gonna wrap up I'm Jimmy. This is bright insight.

118
00:06:38.820 --> 00:06:40.340
I can subscribe, help me spread the message.

119
00:06:40.890 --> 00:06:44.260
Many more videos to come and a whole wide variety of topics. Take care,

120
00:06:44.261 --> 00:06:44.900
everybody. You.
