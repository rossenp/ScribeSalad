00:00:00.420 --> 00:00:05.310
<v 0>There is no way that earth is the only place out of the entire universe</v>

2
00:00:05.490 --> 00:00:09.450
to contain life. And mark my words in our lifetimes,

3
00:00:09.780 --> 00:00:13.290
we will confirm that not only does life live outside of planet earth,

4
00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:16.890
but we can find it right here in our very own solar system.

5
00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:18.870
And if you think that sounds unlikely,

6
00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:21.870
just wait until you hear the details that I'm about to share with you in this

7
00:00:21.871 --> 00:00:22.650
video.

8
00:00:22.650 --> 00:00:26.130
But let me start off by sharing some of the unbelievable places that we've

9
00:00:26.131 --> 00:00:30.660
recently discovered contains life to the utter surprise and amazement of

10
00:00:30.661 --> 00:00:32.940
scientists. Take, for example,

11
00:00:32.941 --> 00:00:37.590
radiation eating bacteria that they've discovered living inside of nuclear

12
00:00:37.591 --> 00:00:42.360
reactors to the complete shock of scientists that not only do the radiation not

13
00:00:42.361 --> 00:00:46.680
kill the bacteria, but the bacteria was thriving off of eating nuclear waste,

14
00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:48.630
something they never thought possible.

15
00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:52.770
Another great example is the abundance of life that they've discovered living

16
00:00:52.771 --> 00:00:56.880
inside and on top of hydrothermal vents deep underneath the ocean

17
00:00:58.110 --> 00:01:01.770
superheated toxic environments once thought to be completely inhospitable to

18
00:01:01.771 --> 00:01:05.040
life. We've since learned that many species make it their home,

19
00:01:05.041 --> 00:01:08.610
whether it be various types of tube, worms, limpets, scale worms,

20
00:01:08.611 --> 00:01:11.610
different types of bacteria, snails, sea spiders,

21
00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:15.990
even different types of fish and octopus make this in-hospital environment.

22
00:01:15.991 --> 00:01:16.824
Their home.

23
00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:20.610
Another interesting example is when they found living microbes living more than

24
00:01:20.611 --> 00:01:23.220
a half mile underneath the Antarctic ice sheet,

25
00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:27.090
after being without sun or air for millions of years,

26
00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:29.250
and these little organisms were thriving,

27
00:01:29.730 --> 00:01:34.620
but a far more amazing example is when they found living bacteria on the outside

28
00:01:34.621 --> 00:01:36.930
of the international space station. And of course,

29
00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:40.740
this created a lot of debate on whether the bacteria came from humans back here

30
00:01:40.741 --> 00:01:41.370
on earth,

31
00:01:41.370 --> 00:01:45.150
and the bacteria survived once it got to space or whether the bacteria had came

32
00:01:45.151 --> 00:01:46.500
from outer space entirely.

33
00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:49.200
And it seems to be determined that it came from humans.

34
00:01:49.201 --> 00:01:52.230
But the interesting part is the fact that for more than three years,

35
00:01:52.231 --> 00:01:55.680
this bacteria had survived the vacuum of space. I mean,

36
00:01:55.681 --> 00:01:59.910
something that could survive a 500 degree Fahrenheit temperature swing between

37
00:01:59.911 --> 00:02:01.440
the difference of sunlight and shade.

38
00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:05.250
So of course they decided to do further experiments and they decided to send up

39
00:02:05.251 --> 00:02:09.660
what are known as tardigrades, which are eight legged invertebrates microscopic,

40
00:02:10.170 --> 00:02:12.630
where they're considered to be the indestructible life form,

41
00:02:12.631 --> 00:02:15.930
which will be the last living thing on earth when the earth eventually dies.

42
00:02:15.931 --> 00:02:20.760
And the sun goes out because these are known to live in extreme environments,

43
00:02:21.330 --> 00:02:22.620
withstanding radiation. And in fact,

44
00:02:22.621 --> 00:02:27.600
they can go without food or water for more than 30 years and can also survive.

45
00:02:27.601 --> 00:02:30.600
Like I said, several hundred degree temperature swings,

46
00:02:30.930 --> 00:02:35.490
and they also to lived outside in the vacuum of space without an issue. I mean,

47
00:02:35.491 --> 00:02:40.230
how incredible is that the point of these examples is to show us that places

48
00:02:40.231 --> 00:02:43.260
that we didn't think that life could survive actually can.

49
00:02:43.260 --> 00:02:45.300
And this is just the beginning of what we thought we knew.

50
00:02:45.301 --> 00:02:49.560
And this reminds me of a quote from Jurassic park. I'm sure you remember it.

51
00:02:50.070 --> 00:02:54.180
Life finds a way. So this brings me to the emphasis of this video,

52
00:02:54.181 --> 00:02:58.590
which is the fact that there are five moons inside of our solar system that have

53
00:02:58.591 --> 00:03:01.390
an incredible likelihood for having some sort of life on it.

54
00:03:01.600 --> 00:03:04.990
And these five moons are found orbiting around Jupiter and Saturn.

55
00:03:04.991 --> 00:03:08.740
So let me start off with the moons around Jupiter and go with Europa,

56
00:03:09.280 --> 00:03:13.690
which has been documented have having these massive water plumes going out of it

57
00:03:13.960 --> 00:03:15.310
out of this IC planet.

58
00:03:15.311 --> 00:03:18.400
So it confirms that there's some sort of geothermal activity,

59
00:03:18.401 --> 00:03:21.370
just like we have on earth. There is a heat source inside of this moon,

60
00:03:21.970 --> 00:03:26.530
and there is a liquid ocean with get this more than twice the volume of all

61
00:03:26.531 --> 00:03:28.450
Earth's oceans combined.

62
00:03:28.900 --> 00:03:32.560
So this of course reminds me of the examples that I just used with hydrothermal

63
00:03:32.561 --> 00:03:35.440
vents, as well as Antarctica microbes,

64
00:03:35.441 --> 00:03:39.010
that who knows what could be living underneath the ice sheets. I mean,

65
00:03:39.040 --> 00:03:41.380
if there's heat there, the question becomes, well,

66
00:03:41.381 --> 00:03:44.440
how warm are these oceans and what could be living inside of them?

67
00:03:44.770 --> 00:03:48.760
Now the two other moons of Jupiter that could potentially have life is Ganymede

68
00:03:48.761 --> 00:03:49.481
and Callisto,

69
00:03:49.481 --> 00:03:52.960
which are believed to have under surface oceans underneath the rock,

70
00:03:52.961 --> 00:03:56.710
potentially more than 60 miles or a hundred kilometers deep underneath the

71
00:03:56.711 --> 00:03:59.680
surface is where these bodies of water are believed to be.

72
00:03:59.980 --> 00:04:01.810
And this of course reminds me of a discovery,

73
00:04:01.811 --> 00:04:05.560
how they found a massive ocean inside of the Earth's mantle more than a third of

74
00:04:05.561 --> 00:04:10.060
the way to the core itself. And real quick, take a look here, press pause.

75
00:04:10.061 --> 00:04:11.230
So you can see this real quick.

76
00:04:11.470 --> 00:04:13.540
These are the five moons that I'm discussing here,

77
00:04:13.541 --> 00:04:14.980
and you can see the size comparison.

78
00:04:15.010 --> 00:04:18.760
Beginning meat is the largest moon in the entire solar system. And in fact,

79
00:04:18.761 --> 00:04:23.050
it's the ninth largest object in the entire solar system, including the sun.

80
00:04:23.380 --> 00:04:26.140
But when you look at pictures of it, you can't help. But think that like, wow,

81
00:04:26.141 --> 00:04:28.270
is there something living there on the surface?

82
00:04:28.780 --> 00:04:33.250
But what we do know about it is that it has a salty ocean with more water than

83
00:04:33.251 --> 00:04:35.350
planet earth. Just think about that,

84
00:04:35.800 --> 00:04:39.490
but where it gets even crazier is that scientists think that this ocean is 60

85
00:04:39.491 --> 00:04:42.250
miles or a hundred kilometers thick more than 10 times,

86
00:04:42.251 --> 00:04:44.140
the depth of the Earth's oceans.

87
00:04:44.410 --> 00:04:47.350
But the very fact that it's a saltwater ocean makes you wonder what could

88
00:04:47.351 --> 00:04:49.090
possibly be living there. I mean,

89
00:04:49.390 --> 00:04:53.890
71% of the earth surface is covered in our saltwater ocean and we've

90
00:04:53.891 --> 00:04:56.050
explored less than 5% of that.

91
00:04:56.350 --> 00:05:00.370
So we can not presume to know what's going on in the ocean underneath the

92
00:05:00.371 --> 00:05:02.770
surface of some moon, a billion miles away.

93
00:05:03.100 --> 00:05:06.520
Now let me transition to the moons of Saturn and start off by talking about

94
00:05:06.521 --> 00:05:09.850
Titan. Titan also has an atmosphere and from the pictures itself,

95
00:05:09.851 --> 00:05:13.330
it does look hospitable, but you need to know that it's very cold. In fact,

96
00:05:13.331 --> 00:05:18.280
negative 292 degrees Fahrenheit, which is negative 180 degrees Celsius,

97
00:05:18.460 --> 00:05:22.090
but that temperature is not far off from the survivability of bacteria on the

98
00:05:22.091 --> 00:05:26.410
outside of the international space station at negative 238 degrees Fahrenheit.

99
00:05:26.411 --> 00:05:30.370
So it makes you wonder also take a look at these surface photos as they had a

100
00:05:30.371 --> 00:05:34.240
Lander go on it. And these were basically the only photos of it that exists.

101
00:05:34.270 --> 00:05:36.910
Very few. They're not very good as you can tell,

102
00:05:37.300 --> 00:05:40.420
but what's so interesting is that there are methane lakes confirmed to be on the

103
00:05:40.421 --> 00:05:44.890
surface of Titan and methane on planet earth only comes from living organisms,

104
00:05:45.040 --> 00:05:48.670
which is the reason why so many scientists speculate the possibility of life on

105
00:05:48.671 --> 00:05:51.760
Titan. But this makes me wonder what the possibilities are. I mean,

106
00:05:51.761 --> 00:05:54.610
we all remember the Gulf oil spill from several years ago,

107
00:05:54.910 --> 00:05:58.880
and then help me discover that this bacteria was eating in thriving off the oil

108
00:05:58.881 --> 00:06:01.910
spill and basically cleaned most of it up all by itself.

109
00:06:01.940 --> 00:06:03.500
And it completely shocked scientists.

110
00:06:03.860 --> 00:06:06.470
So who knows what could possibly be going on on the moon Titan.

111
00:06:06.860 --> 00:06:09.380
Now the last moon I'm discussing is Enceladus, which is,

112
00:06:09.410 --> 00:06:11.930
has a liquid ocean frozen beneath the surface,

113
00:06:12.260 --> 00:06:14.720
and also has the geysers and water plumes. In fact,

114
00:06:14.780 --> 00:06:17.240
more than 100 geysers have been documented.

115
00:06:17.600 --> 00:06:21.080
So it confirms that there's some sort of geothermal activity on this moon.

116
00:06:21.081 --> 00:06:25.340
So the question again becomes how warm is the ocean underneath and for various

117
00:06:25.341 --> 00:06:26.690
data that we've obtained,

118
00:06:26.900 --> 00:06:30.230
this moon has nearly all of the ingredients to support life.

119
00:06:30.470 --> 00:06:34.190
And the only way to confirm the rest of it is to go down and land on this moon

120
00:06:34.310 --> 00:06:36.230
and discover what's there. So again,

121
00:06:36.231 --> 00:06:40.160
when we remind ourselves of how tardigrades can survive in radiation,

122
00:06:40.340 --> 00:06:44.660
the vacuum of space and several hundred degree temperature swings or the various

123
00:06:44.661 --> 00:06:48.440
different forms of life that are living in hydrothermal vents or a bacteria

124
00:06:48.441 --> 00:06:51.380
living in a nuclear reactors and,

125
00:06:51.570 --> 00:06:53.660
and underneath the Antarctica ice sheets,

126
00:06:53.990 --> 00:06:56.690
we really have to remind ourselves that we just don't know everything about

127
00:06:56.691 --> 00:07:00.290
life. And going back to that Jurassic park quote, life finds a way.

128
00:07:00.650 --> 00:07:02.870
And this reminds me of a study conducted by NASA,

129
00:07:02.871 --> 00:07:07.490
where they determined that Venus was very likely to have been habitable for 2

130
00:07:07.490 --> 00:07:09.740
billion years at one point in the distant past.

131
00:07:10.190 --> 00:07:13.850
So there are at least five chances that there is life living on moons in our

132
00:07:13.851 --> 00:07:16.850
solar system, not just one or two possibilities, but five,

133
00:07:17.180 --> 00:07:18.830
think about the incredible odds of that.

134
00:07:18.831 --> 00:07:20.780
And the fact that there's geothermal vents there,

135
00:07:21.380 --> 00:07:24.710
there's obviously a few ingredients that are absolutely necessary for life

136
00:07:25.040 --> 00:07:26.300
hydrogen, carbon,

137
00:07:26.630 --> 00:07:29.180
but we already know that some of these things already exist on the moon.

138
00:07:29.240 --> 00:07:33.350
And we already know in these incredible miraculous places where like is lit, uh,

139
00:07:33.410 --> 00:07:35.390
can live in outer space and here on earth,

140
00:07:35.960 --> 00:07:37.970
we have to start asking new questions.

141
00:07:37.971 --> 00:07:42.080
And although I'm not saying that there's some conspiracy to keep this knowledge

142
00:07:42.110 --> 00:07:43.730
from the masses because there's not,

143
00:07:44.300 --> 00:07:47.630
but most mainstream news networks don't even report on these stories.

144
00:07:47.631 --> 00:07:50.690
You have to go to science websites to actually learn about them and seek it out

145
00:07:50.691 --> 00:07:53.420
yourself, which makes me wonder how much of this,

146
00:07:53.660 --> 00:07:57.200
these specifics about these moons are being taught to kids in school today.

147
00:07:57.230 --> 00:07:59.690
Can anyone leave a comment and answer that question?

148
00:07:59.691 --> 00:08:04.460
Because it's very important that the new generation of open-minded people are

149
00:08:04.461 --> 00:08:07.220
knowing that there's a possibility that in their lifetime,

150
00:08:07.430 --> 00:08:10.400
we are gonna discover alien life in our very own solar system,

151
00:08:10.401 --> 00:08:12.410
which will be a shock to many people.

152
00:08:12.920 --> 00:08:17.150
So for us to progress faster than we have been by this establishment that has

153
00:08:17.270 --> 00:08:20.570
kept us from going back to the moon. I mean, we haven't even been to Mars yet.

154
00:08:20.600 --> 00:08:25.520
I remember distinctly being in the seventh grade and there was articles in the

155
00:08:25.521 --> 00:08:28.580
newspaper. I remember our teachers sharing it with us, how NASA said that. Yeah,

156
00:08:28.670 --> 00:08:33.080
we'll probably be in Mars, landing on Mars with people by 2016.

157
00:08:33.081 --> 00:08:35.780
And that was back in 19 96, 19 97,

158
00:08:35.840 --> 00:08:39.800
here we are 2018 and we were years away from going there. Right?

159
00:08:39.890 --> 00:08:42.920
So that's why it's so important that more people become aware of this

160
00:08:42.921 --> 00:08:46.910
information because that's what it's going to take as a new generation of people

161
00:08:47.030 --> 00:08:50.600
that are wanting to make change and look into things themselves that are not

162
00:08:50.601 --> 00:08:53.420
willing to accept the status quo of what we've been enduring for the last

163
00:08:53.421 --> 00:08:55.380
several decades. Having not been to the.

164
00:08:55.380 --> 00:08:59.340
<v 1>Moon and sit 40 fricking years. Right. But I'll wrap it up there.</v>

165
00:08:59.370 --> 00:09:01.800
I have many other videos to come and a bunch of different topics.

166
