00:00:00.450 --> 00:00:05.400
<v 0>A massive discovery of more than 60,000 structures found hidden</v>

2
00:00:05.610 --> 00:00:07.110
in the jungles of Guatemala,

3
00:00:07.320 --> 00:00:10.890
prove that ancient Mayan civilization was double,

4
00:00:10.891 --> 00:00:14.730
if not triple the size of what we ever thought with estimates,

5
00:00:14.731 --> 00:00:19.230
exceeding 10 to 15 million people up from approximately

6
00:00:19.231 --> 00:00:23.760
5 million people estimated during the peak of the Mayan civilization some 1200

7
00:00:23.761 --> 00:00:28.380
years ago. But before I go into the mindblowing details of this discovery,

8
00:00:28.381 --> 00:00:32.340
as it's been described by professors and scientists from around the world,

9
00:00:32.730 --> 00:00:37.530
first, this discussed the insane implications of the find in itself. One,

10
00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:41.610
this demonstrates just how much we don't know about our ancient past. I mean,

11
00:00:41.611 --> 00:00:43.710
here we are in 2018,

12
00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:48.750
and we're just now learning about a 15 million person mega Opolis

13
00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:50.130
as it's been described,

14
00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:53.970
but a more important implication is that it shows just how much more is waiting

15
00:00:53.971 --> 00:00:58.410
to be found from our ancient past, not just from Mayan civilization,

16
00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:00.510
but from civilizations all over the world.

17
00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:02.340
And I'll touch on that later in this video.

18
00:01:02.610 --> 00:01:05.430
Now I'm sure we all saw the headlines going around the world about this

19
00:01:05.431 --> 00:01:07.170
discovery on how LIDAR,

20
00:01:07.171 --> 00:01:11.940
which is essentially lasers that make a 3d mapping system of the ground below

21
00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:16.560
identified more than 60,000 structures in total, including houses,

22
00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:20.250
palaces, tombs, even a massive freeway system,

23
00:01:20.251 --> 00:01:23.610
large enough to conduct high volume trading for of course,

24
00:01:23.611 --> 00:01:26.670
tens of millions of people and all of this, by the way,

25
00:01:26.671 --> 00:01:30.540
what makes it even crazier is that this same land had already been chartered and

26
00:01:30.541 --> 00:01:33.660
surveyed on foot, and they never saw any of this,

27
00:01:33.661 --> 00:01:37.320
including a seven story pyramid. And just to paint you a picture,

28
00:01:37.321 --> 00:01:41.340
take a look at this photo for what the ground looks from your own eyes compared

29
00:01:41.341 --> 00:01:42.360
to the 3d imaging.

30
00:01:42.361 --> 00:01:47.220
So how LIDAR works is that a plane flies overhead and does millions of

31
00:01:47.221 --> 00:01:48.450
pulses of lasers,

32
00:01:48.750 --> 00:01:52.770
and essentially perforates through the foliage of the jungle down below and

33
00:01:52.771 --> 00:01:54.900
creates this 3d mapping system. As I mentioned,

34
00:01:55.140 --> 00:02:00.060
this LIDAR technology is groundbreaking for archeology in it is so much more

35
00:02:00.061 --> 00:02:03.450
efficient than anything we've ever had before to put it into perspective.

36
00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:08.880
A team took eight years to map out one square mile of this forest

37
00:02:08.881 --> 00:02:09.714
floor.

38
00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:15.000
Where's the LIDAR system from the plane was able to conduct 67 square miles

39
00:02:15.240 --> 00:02:19.590
of mapping in just a matter of hours. And this system found so much,

40
00:02:19.620 --> 00:02:20.071
like I said,

41
00:02:20.071 --> 00:02:23.790
more than 60,000 structures that experts are saying that it's going to take more

42
00:02:23.791 --> 00:02:28.080
than 100 years to simply go through the data itself and they're not done

43
00:02:28.081 --> 00:02:29.340
searching yet. So far,

44
00:02:29.341 --> 00:02:33.720
they've gone through just over 800 square miles yet they have more than 5,000

45
00:02:33.721 --> 00:02:36.060
additional square miles yet to be explored.

46
00:02:36.330 --> 00:02:40.410
This find is certainly a wake-up call for archeologists scientists and academics

47
00:02:40.411 --> 00:02:41.340
from around the world.

48
00:02:41.700 --> 00:02:46.050
And that it shows that when you have the Mayan civilization with 10 to 15

49
00:02:46.050 --> 00:02:48.000
million people and this mega Apolis, which real quick,

50
00:02:48.001 --> 00:02:52.230
I need to mention the Mayan civilization was made up of approximately 40 cities,

51
00:02:52.560 --> 00:02:56.010
which is now spans across six different countries, as you can see here.

52
00:02:56.310 --> 00:02:59.920
So when we consider that the Mayan civilization mysteriously vanished off the

53
00:02:59.950 --> 00:03:02.050
earth about a thousand years ago,

54
00:03:02.051 --> 00:03:06.490
despite being as large as 10 to 15 million people. And in real quick,

55
00:03:06.491 --> 00:03:08.980
when I say mysterious, well more modern, uh,

56
00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:13.090
research has determined that it was likely due to a severe drought deforestation

57
00:03:13.091 --> 00:03:14.890
that the Mayans pretty much wiped themselves out.

58
00:03:15.130 --> 00:03:19.930
And yet a metropolitan area of 15 million people has been just completely

59
00:03:20.020 --> 00:03:22.210
unknown to us for so long. I mean,

60
00:03:22.211 --> 00:03:25.720
we thought that ancient Egyptians were a mystery and how many things we don't

61
00:03:25.721 --> 00:03:29.170
know about that civilization and all the unanswered questions we have and they

62
00:03:29.171 --> 00:03:31.120
date back 4,500 years ago,

63
00:03:31.510 --> 00:03:34.540
but something so much more recent as a thousand years ago,

64
00:03:34.541 --> 00:03:39.190
it just goes to show on how quickly the earth absorbs and consumes everything

65
00:03:39.191 --> 00:03:42.940
from our ancient paths. I mean, even take the example of the Mastodon bones,

66
00:03:42.941 --> 00:03:45.550
and you may have seen the headlines of this, uh, about a year ago.

67
00:03:45.550 --> 00:03:49.510
And I made a video on it where it proved that humans were in north America

68
00:03:49.630 --> 00:03:52.450
130,000 years ago, which of course,

69
00:03:52.630 --> 00:03:55.780
there's a major wrench in the human migration process and everything we thought

70
00:03:55.781 --> 00:03:59.410
we knew about human history we're even take the example of Gobekli TAPI,

71
00:03:59.411 --> 00:04:03.640
which I've of course shared in various other videos where less than 10% of this

72
00:04:03.670 --> 00:04:07.870
enormous site has been excavated, as they've determined through ground radar.

73
00:04:08.230 --> 00:04:11.290
And this site is 50 times larger, larger than Stonehenge.

74
00:04:11.291 --> 00:04:14.710
So it makes you wonder what are they going to find as they continue to dig

75
00:04:14.711 --> 00:04:17.530
deeper and deeper and explore this site. And in fact,

76
00:04:17.531 --> 00:04:21.100
it even reminds me of the Giza plateau in all the structures that have been

77
00:04:21.101 --> 00:04:23.950
found underneath and buried from the sands of Egypt.

78
00:04:24.220 --> 00:04:27.130
And if you look at the surrounding area and how much they built upon it,

79
00:04:27.550 --> 00:04:30.370
it makes you wonder what is lying underneath the roads and the houses and

80
00:04:30.371 --> 00:04:32.140
buildings in this area. I mean,

81
00:04:32.141 --> 00:04:35.800
we have to start embracing the fact that human civilization dates back far

82
00:04:35.801 --> 00:04:38.830
earlier than we ever thought possible. And I've mentioned, of course,

83
00:04:38.831 --> 00:04:41.890
the water erosion around the enclosure of the Sphinx in many videos,

84
00:04:41.891 --> 00:04:45.910
but it turns out anytime I mentioned in the new video about ancient human

85
00:04:45.911 --> 00:04:47.920
civilization dating back tens of thousands of years,

86
00:04:47.921 --> 00:04:50.680
and I don't present the evidence to the new subscribers. They're like,

87
00:04:50.681 --> 00:04:54.550
what are you talking about? So often make a detailed video on this in itself.

88
00:04:54.580 --> 00:04:58.750
But the water erosion is so significant and the evidence shows that it was

89
00:04:58.751 --> 00:05:00.880
rainwater erosion, not flooding.

90
00:05:01.240 --> 00:05:04.150
And I highly recommend you look into the works of Dr. Robert Shak on this,

91
00:05:04.151 --> 00:05:09.010
but the last time the Nile Delta region had significant rainfall was 9,000

92
00:05:09.011 --> 00:05:09.844
years ago.

93
00:05:10.120 --> 00:05:13.900
And what we're looking at here is more than tens of thousands of years of water

94
00:05:13.901 --> 00:05:17.260
rain, erosion. So it raises all kinds of questions. And by the way,

95
00:05:17.710 --> 00:05:19.540
the only the evidence doesn't stop there,

96
00:05:19.720 --> 00:05:23.530
the Egyptians detailed lineage of the pharaohs dating back more than 30,000

97
00:05:23.531 --> 00:05:25.060
years. So it starts to make sense.

98
00:05:25.390 --> 00:05:28.120
So when we reflect in the possibility of human civilization,

99
00:05:28.121 --> 00:05:29.890
dating back tens of thousands of years,

100
00:05:30.190 --> 00:05:33.610
we also have to take into account global sea levels. I mean, even today,

101
00:05:33.611 --> 00:05:37.090
almost half the world's population lives right on or near the coast.

102
00:05:37.450 --> 00:05:38.650
And of course in ancient times,

103
00:05:38.651 --> 00:05:41.860
that number is believed to be much higher because of the abundance of resources.

104
00:05:42.520 --> 00:05:46.510
So when you consider that 24,000 years ago, during the last glacial maximum,

105
00:05:46.870 --> 00:05:51.070
there are sea levels were approximately 425 feet lower than they are today.

106
00:05:51.460 --> 00:05:54.820
We have to imagine what might be lying underneath the water and the shallow

107
00:05:54.821 --> 00:05:57.010
oceans, just a couple hundred feet out. I mean,

108
00:05:57.110 --> 00:06:01.310
we've already found many different aspects or things from ancient civilizations.

109
00:06:01.400 --> 00:06:04.700
And this is of course, by the way, spread across multiple continents.

110
00:06:04.710 --> 00:06:07.820
I'll have to make a video on this in detail in the future, for sure.

111
00:06:08.090 --> 00:06:11.720
But we have to be reminded that there's not some team of scientists out there

112
00:06:11.721 --> 00:06:15.860
digging underground for, you know, remnants of loss, ancient civilization,

113
00:06:15.861 --> 00:06:17.060
or looking under the ocean. I mean,

114
00:06:17.061 --> 00:06:20.720
those Mastodon bones were found because they were digging a freeway in San

115
00:06:20.721 --> 00:06:21.171
Diego.

116
00:06:21.171 --> 00:06:24.200
And that's the only reason why they found them and the excavations going on in

117
00:06:24.201 --> 00:06:26.510
the ocean of all people looking for pirate ships and treasure,

118
00:06:26.511 --> 00:06:29.120
right on the floor of the ocean or inches or feet below.

119
00:06:29.240 --> 00:06:32.060
And even when we are looking for something specific, I mean,

120
00:06:32.061 --> 00:06:35.540
look in re this remind ourselves of the Malaysian airlines flight three 70,

121
00:06:35.541 --> 00:06:39.380
which coming up on four years ago, vanished with almost without a trace,

122
00:06:39.381 --> 00:06:41.300
besides a couple pieces of the Bri.

123
00:06:41.810 --> 00:06:45.440
And they know it's somewhere in the Indian ocean and yet they still can't find

124
00:06:45.441 --> 00:06:47.090
it. I mean, just think about that.

125
00:06:47.420 --> 00:06:51.110
The message and the takeaway of this finding from Mayan civilization is this,

126
00:06:51.230 --> 00:06:55.430
that the new generation that will soon be replacing the old establishment within

127
00:06:55.431 --> 00:06:57.500
the scientific community, because make no mistake,

128
00:06:57.980 --> 00:07:01.040
the scientific community has the same issues we're seeing in politics or

129
00:07:01.041 --> 00:07:05.000
government, the mood, the news media, or people in their egos get in the way.

130
00:07:05.120 --> 00:07:08.720
And it slows down the process of finding new evidence and coming up with new

131
00:07:08.721 --> 00:07:10.820
theories that will make far more sense.

132
00:07:11.180 --> 00:07:15.110
So I'm hoping that my videos will inspire others who are in this field and

133
00:07:15.111 --> 00:07:18.080
trying to make a name for themselves to chase after this new topic.

134
00:07:18.081 --> 00:07:22.400
Because again, mark, my words, the most amazing discoveries yet to be found are,

135
00:07:22.490 --> 00:07:26.600
well, they're still buried, but obviously this is a fascinating topic. So like,

136
00:07:26.630 --> 00:07:29.210
leave me a comment, let me know what your thoughts are. And real quick,

137
00:07:29.240 --> 00:07:32.990
if you haven't seen my most recent video prior to this one involving the surging

138
00:07:32.991 --> 00:07:35.960
epidemic and people searching for the life purpose, check it out,

139
00:07:35.961 --> 00:07:38.720
I've got some awesome feedback from it and I'm very proud of that video.

140
00:07:39.020 --> 00:07:41.210
So I hope that you'll watch it because if it's not for you,

141
00:07:41.450 --> 00:07:43.880
it's definitely something that you could recommend to a friend or a family

142
00:07:43.881 --> 00:07:46.970
member, for sure. So I'll just leave it at that. I'm JV.

143
00:07:46.971 --> 00:07:48.830
This is bright insight like, and subscribe,

144
00:07:48.831 --> 00:07:51.890
and I have many more videos to come and a whole wide variety of topics.

145
00:07:52.310 --> 00:07:52.910
Take care, everybody.
