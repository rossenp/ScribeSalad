00:00:01.060 --> 00:00:03.080
<v 0>Hey, everybody, Jimmy here with bright insight.</v>

2
00:00:03.190 --> 00:00:05.520
What you're looking at are photos that I took myself.

3
00:00:05.660 --> 00:00:06.920
And at the end of this presentation,

4
00:00:06.980 --> 00:00:10.760
I'm gonna show you three different videos as well that I took while deployed to

5
00:00:10.830 --> 00:00:15.680
Iraq in August of 2010 while in Mosel and Mosel is located in the

6
00:00:15.860 --> 00:00:18.280
NVA province, which is historically famous in that.

7
00:00:18.281 --> 00:00:21.430
There's a story from the Bible of Jonah who was swallowed up by the whale.

8
00:00:21.530 --> 00:00:22.311
And three days later,

9
00:00:22.311 --> 00:00:25.430
he got out and apparently he immediately went to the gates of NAL,

10
00:00:25.520 --> 00:00:28.790
which is the exact location where you see me standing here. And yeah,

11
00:00:28.791 --> 00:00:30.750
that's me in the photographs trying to look cool.

12
00:00:31.070 --> 00:00:34.430
&lt;laugh&gt; so these gates have been largely restored,

13
00:00:34.570 --> 00:00:36.950
but many aspects like the wall, uh, for example,

14
00:00:37.470 --> 00:00:40.870
ha is completely original except for the top pieces. Like look at this photo,

15
00:00:41.050 --> 00:00:43.540
fear of the guard tower, where you see that there's been mortar,

16
00:00:43.541 --> 00:00:45.380
that's been added to restore the blocks,

17
00:00:45.760 --> 00:00:48.900
but the rest of the blocks are completely just stacked upon each other.

18
00:00:49.080 --> 00:00:51.180
And the wall exceeds more than 30 feet high.

19
00:00:51.280 --> 00:00:54.780
And I'll show you some of the figures here in a second. Now, these wing bowls,

20
00:00:54.920 --> 00:00:57.300
as they're referred to, as they're also known as the LA MASU,

21
00:00:58.010 --> 00:00:59.100
they're very mysterious.

22
00:00:59.560 --> 00:01:02.450
The only thing archeologists can come up with is that they must,

23
00:01:02.970 --> 00:01:06.370
because they're not sure that they must originate from the Asan culture,

24
00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:09.890
approximately 3000 BC. So in other words,

25
00:01:10.060 --> 00:01:13.730
5,500 years ago, or 4,500, or excuse me,

26
00:01:13.731 --> 00:01:17.410
1000 years before the pyramids allegedly were built because the textbooks tell

27
00:01:17.411 --> 00:01:21.490
us that they were built 4,500 years ago, which I disagree with. But that aside,

28
00:01:21.500 --> 00:01:24.680
these are a thousand years older than the pyramids are supposed to be.

29
00:01:25.030 --> 00:01:28.360
They're absolutely massive. There's dozens of them that exist.

30
00:01:28.510 --> 00:01:32.400
There's some in museums in Baghdad and they also have been found in Iran,

31
00:01:32.530 --> 00:01:35.720
which is pretty incredible. So whoever made these, uh,

32
00:01:35.790 --> 00:01:37.800
were part of a civilization that was very vast,

33
00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:41.720
which historically we know that Sumerians come from Mesopotamia and they covered

34
00:01:41.760 --> 00:01:45.030
a vast areas. So it's pretty incredible. Now the area itself,

35
00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:47.630
basically there's nine gates from what I understand,

36
00:01:48.130 --> 00:01:50.910
and it's surrounded by this wall, which is absolutely huge. I mean,

37
00:01:51.110 --> 00:01:53.150
compared to the size of that van right there.

38
00:01:54.290 --> 00:01:57.150
Now it's also worth mentioning that the Iraqis do not take good care of this

39
00:01:57.350 --> 00:01:59.470
location at all. It's surrounded by a bunch of burnt out,

40
00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:02.710
blown up and shot up cars and vehicles from the war. It's pretty,

41
00:02:02.990 --> 00:02:04.580
it pretty screwed up. Um,

42
00:02:04.600 --> 00:02:07.060
and right across the street from it is an Iraqi police station,

43
00:02:07.070 --> 00:02:09.500
which is what we were doing there. And I was one of,

44
00:02:09.540 --> 00:02:12.420
I was very privileged to be able to go up and check out these, uh,

45
00:02:13.020 --> 00:02:15.500
these statues myself. And again, at the end of the video, I'll show you some,

46
00:02:15.890 --> 00:02:19.700
some actual video of it, uh, and me, uh, shooting it, which is pretty hilarious.

47
00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:23.380
But I remember going there and walking up as you can see this,

48
00:02:24.020 --> 00:02:27.250
which is original, from what I understand, or at least it appears to be,

49
00:02:27.590 --> 00:02:29.410
and I couldn't help, but imagine who,

50
00:02:29.790 --> 00:02:33.770
how many armies and people had walked up this before and just been completely

51
00:02:33.771 --> 00:02:34.604
just,

52
00:02:34.670 --> 00:02:38.090
it was really interesting being there personally and being able to witness it,

53
00:02:38.250 --> 00:02:39.290
cuz I knew I was in a very special,

54
00:02:39.470 --> 00:02:44.280
old place that was full of mystery and God knows how much well history within in

55
00:02:44.281 --> 00:02:45.280
itself. Now,

56
00:02:45.281 --> 00:02:49.960
as you can see in this photo of this plaque and it's trying to depict,

57
00:02:49.961 --> 00:02:52.280
which appears to be slaves.

58
00:02:52.281 --> 00:02:55.080
And I say that because the person on the middle on the left appears to be

59
00:02:55.081 --> 00:02:58.160
whipping them as they carry up. What appears to be, I don't know,

60
00:02:58.180 --> 00:03:02.880
one of these statues or perhaps a person, a dead person, a coffin,

61
00:03:02.920 --> 00:03:06.200
I don't know. Now I also need to mention that these statues themselves,

62
00:03:06.260 --> 00:03:09.640
as you can see in this photo here was buried when they found it,

63
00:03:10.090 --> 00:03:11.840
which is really interesting, cuz how is it buried?

64
00:03:11.860 --> 00:03:14.240
And when this site in itself is also famous,

65
00:03:14.241 --> 00:03:18.200
because you may have seen it on the news a couple years ago when ISIS was seen,

66
00:03:18.440 --> 00:03:22.710
uh, breaking them up with, uh, Jack hammers and sledgehammers and uh,

67
00:03:22.711 --> 00:03:25.990
just pretty pathetic. I don't even think that they destroyed them entirely.

68
00:03:26.060 --> 00:03:26.750
They showed some,

69
00:03:26.750 --> 00:03:29.510
I remember seeing video of it and they were having difficulty even with the

70
00:03:29.590 --> 00:03:33.270
sledgehammers and with the jackhammer. Because again, this is quartz guys.

71
00:03:33.271 --> 00:03:34.550
This is really hard stuff.

72
00:03:34.930 --> 00:03:38.510
And if you go watch some video of them actually trying to beat it, uh, I mean,

73
00:03:38.511 --> 00:03:39.700
yeah, they break it up,

74
00:03:39.720 --> 00:03:42.420
but it didn't look too easy and that's with fricking power tools.

75
00:03:42.680 --> 00:03:46.380
So it really makes you wonder now look at these other photographs of the wall.

76
00:03:46.560 --> 00:03:46.981
And again,

77
00:03:46.981 --> 00:03:51.100
it surrounds an area that is apparently 12 kilometers I think is the perimeter.

78
00:03:51.900 --> 00:03:55.580
Um, and I'm gonna show a picture up here that has the description that's poorly

79
00:03:55.710 --> 00:03:59.100
translated, but uh, you can read it for yourself, press.

80
00:03:59.550 --> 00:04:01.490
Now if you wanna read it. But again,

81
00:04:01.530 --> 00:04:03.970
I wanna point out just the amazing precision.

82
00:04:04.450 --> 00:04:07.370
It it's not until you touch these things yourself. I remember knocking on these,

83
00:04:08.090 --> 00:04:10.490
these statues with my, with my hand, with my knuckles,

84
00:04:10.491 --> 00:04:12.330
even though I was wearing a glove, it still hurts.

85
00:04:12.650 --> 00:04:15.770
I was astonished by just how solid and hard it feels.

86
00:04:16.070 --> 00:04:18.810
And when you look at just the fine details they have within the beard,

87
00:04:19.230 --> 00:04:23.480
the feathers and the underbelly of this being that this person,

88
00:04:23.550 --> 00:04:28.160
this guy's face with a big beard and this ox or horse body with massive wings.

89
00:04:28.190 --> 00:04:31.400
It's I don't what made them come up with this and why did they build dozens of

90
00:04:31.401 --> 00:04:35.000
them in the first place? Is it just symbolism? I mean really? What is this?

91
00:04:35.100 --> 00:04:38.320
Is this part of something else that we just can't even imagine? I have no idea,

92
00:04:39.260 --> 00:04:40.440
but the precision in it's.

93
00:04:40.480 --> 00:04:44.070
So I can't imagine the fact that this is made out of court site,

94
00:04:44.071 --> 00:04:46.190
which is a seven outta 10 on the most scale of hard.

95
00:04:46.390 --> 00:04:48.110
I mean it's harder than rose granite. Okay.

96
00:04:48.530 --> 00:04:51.510
So it makes you wonder how they were able to do something so detailed,

97
00:04:51.511 --> 00:04:54.990
even if they had steel, which we know they didn't, it's a bronze age culture,

98
00:04:55.300 --> 00:04:56.550
allegedly where these came from.

99
00:04:57.010 --> 00:05:00.630
So they shouldn't have had anything other than copper to work with and modern

100
00:05:00.870 --> 00:05:03.820
day utilize diamond bit drills. And they,

101
00:05:03.821 --> 00:05:05.700
they acknowledge that because of the hardness.

102
00:05:05.701 --> 00:05:08.580
You can't even shape these without having steel,

103
00:05:09.280 --> 00:05:11.700
but even if I had a steel pick, even if they had that,

104
00:05:11.980 --> 00:05:13.980
let's say which apparently they don't, but if they did,

105
00:05:14.120 --> 00:05:15.300
and we're just not aware of it,

106
00:05:15.740 --> 00:05:18.940
I couldn't even imagine doing something so precise because quartzite is full of

107
00:05:18.941 --> 00:05:23.330
crystals. So it would be so rugged and or rigid, I should say. Uh,

108
00:05:23.350 --> 00:05:25.490
and breaking up. I don't know guys. Yeah, to me,

109
00:05:25.491 --> 00:05:27.890
this is absolute evidence of lost ancient high technology.

110
00:05:27.950 --> 00:05:31.050
And there's far more to the story of these wing bulls than what the fricking

111
00:05:31.051 --> 00:05:35.770
Wikipedia page says. So, uh, keep that in mind now real quick.

112
00:05:35.810 --> 00:05:39.490
I wanna show you these photographs. So when I was in Mosel, I was on fab Marez,

113
00:05:39.491 --> 00:05:42.010
which is part of, uh, diamond back, which was the air base.

114
00:05:42.400 --> 00:05:45.640
There doesn't exist anymore, obviously since we left, but St.

115
00:05:45.720 --> 00:05:48.800
Elijah's monastery, which is Iraq's oldest monastery,

116
00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:51.160
apparently which originates from the sixth century.

117
00:05:51.620 --> 00:05:56.520
So in the year 500 something this was made and it has a rich history that,

118
00:05:56.830 --> 00:05:59.760
well, apparently it's been massacred multiple times, uh,

119
00:05:59.761 --> 00:06:02.000
by invaders and everyone else, but, uh,

120
00:06:02.001 --> 00:06:05.680
it's incredibly old and it makes you wonder the story behind it for something

121
00:06:05.681 --> 00:06:10.400
that is, again, we're talking 1500 years ago, this was built, uh,

122
00:06:10.401 --> 00:06:13.640
but ISIS also blew it up or bulldozed it. You can see it in these photos here.

123
00:06:13.641 --> 00:06:16.400
And that was on the news not long ago, but, uh, or a few years ago.

124
00:06:16.570 --> 00:06:19.670
So it's pretty disturbing. Anyways, guys, let me know your thoughts.

125
00:06:19.740 --> 00:06:20.910
Take a look at these videos.

126
00:06:20.911 --> 00:06:22.590
Now I'm gonna go ahead and play for you back to back.

127
00:06:22.591 --> 00:06:26.550
Two of 'em are at the site of Neal and the third one is just driving past the,

128
00:06:26.710 --> 00:06:26.930
uh, St.

129
00:06:26.930 --> 00:06:31.190
Elijah Mona monastery on the way to the test fire pit before going on mission in

130
00:06:31.191 --> 00:06:34.470
Iraq. Anyways, guys, I'm Jamie, this is bright insight like in subscribe,

131
00:06:34.471 --> 00:06:37.500
leave a comment. Watch the videos coming up right in now.

132
00:06:59.560 --> 00:07:02.170
<v 1>Yeah. &lt;laugh&gt; we touristed Iraq.</v>

133
00:07:23.810 --> 00:07:27.420
Yeah, these are, yeah, those are nice.

134
00:07:34.440 --> 00:07:35.273
Are they

135
00:08:00.350 --> 00:08:01.183
okay?

136
00:08:24.500 --> 00:08:25.333
Okay.

137
00:08:35.090 --> 00:08:35.210
I.
