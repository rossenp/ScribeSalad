1
00:00:07.220 --> 00:00:11.360
<v 1>So it's time that we have a serious level-headed conversation about the topic of</v>

2
00:00:11.361 --> 00:00:16.160
UFO phenomena. That's right. Aliens. Have they visited planet earth or not?

3
00:00:16.940 --> 00:00:17.870
In this video,

4
00:00:17.930 --> 00:00:22.550
I'm going to outline three specific mass UFO sightings witnessed by thousands of

5
00:00:22.551 --> 00:00:25.910
people. And at the end of this, you're going to have to ask yourself, well,

6
00:00:25.911 --> 00:00:28.640
either it's aliens or top secret technology,

7
00:00:28.641 --> 00:00:31.460
that's been suppressed from the masses for several decades.

8
00:00:31.820 --> 00:00:34.790
<v 2>Now, before I get into those three cases, let me first ask,</v>

9
00:00:34.791 --> 00:00:38.720
does anyone else find it interesting that, well, say president Obama,

10
00:00:38.870 --> 00:00:39.980
in the beginning of his term,

11
00:00:40.250 --> 00:00:44.060
he stated that he had no knowledge of UFO visitation to planet earth.

12
00:00:44.510 --> 00:00:45.860
Then he said he didn't know.

13
00:00:46.010 --> 00:00:49.010
And then just a couple of years before he left office, he says,

14
00:00:49.250 --> 00:00:53.120
I can't reveal anything. In fact, former president George W.

15
00:00:53.120 --> 00:00:55.010
Bush said the same thing earlier this year.

16
00:00:55.400 --> 00:00:59.870
<v 1>I'm not saying nothing. Like, why not just say, I don't know or no,</v>

17
00:01:00.200 --> 00:01:03.410
but to say I can't reveal anything or I'm not saying anything, like,

18
00:01:03.411 --> 00:01:04.610
I don't understand, like,

19
00:01:04.611 --> 00:01:08.090
especially in the case of Obama who was president at the time, who's your boss.

20
00:01:08.150 --> 00:01:11.750
I, what do you mean? You're not allowed to say anything. I did.

21
00:01:11.751 --> 00:01:14.420
I misread the constitution and who's really in charge,

22
00:01:15.740 --> 00:01:18.350
but they're not the only presidents who have discussed this. In fact,

23
00:01:18.351 --> 00:01:21.680
Jimmy Carter, back when he was governor, he had a UFO sighting.

24
00:01:21.681 --> 00:01:25.550
He saw himself and there's even a sworn statement to prove it or even take

25
00:01:25.551 --> 00:01:28.340
president Ronald Reagan. When he was governor of California,

26
00:01:28.370 --> 00:01:33.140
he had his pilot follow a white orb. And after a few minutes, he said, quote,

27
00:01:33.141 --> 00:01:36.530
it's shot up to the heavens straight into outer space. Like, what is that about?

28
00:01:36.860 --> 00:01:39.170
And it's worth mentioning that even McKell Gorbachev,

29
00:01:39.171 --> 00:01:42.290
who was the president of Russia at the same time as Reagan made a similar

30
00:01:42.291 --> 00:01:47.090
comment about the existence of UFO's even take Paul Hellyer the former

31
00:01:47.120 --> 00:01:51.530
defense minister of Canada who was even acting prime minister at one point that

32
00:01:51.531 --> 00:01:55.730
has stated publicly on numerous occasions that yes, aliens are visiting earth.

33
00:01:55.760 --> 00:01:56.870
There's multiple species.

34
00:01:57.110 --> 00:02:00.440
One of which you could walk down the street right next to when you would have no

35
00:02:00.441 --> 00:02:03.740
idea that they were an alien, which raises all kinds of questions. Now,

36
00:02:03.741 --> 00:02:05.480
whether you believe these people are ham, I mean,

37
00:02:05.481 --> 00:02:08.540
that's a whole different story. What do I know? But it is interesting,

38
00:02:08.780 --> 00:02:11.870
but they're not the only ones guys take. John Podesta,

39
00:02:11.960 --> 00:02:15.200
chief of staff for bill Clinton, chief of staff for president Obama,

40
00:02:15.560 --> 00:02:19.100
chief of staff for Hillary Clinton during her, uh, campaign, uh, just this,

41
00:02:19.130 --> 00:02:20.300
during this last election,

42
00:02:20.630 --> 00:02:24.650
he had stated that his greatest regret was not being able to release UFO files.

43
00:02:24.680 --> 00:02:27.620
Now that could be just some political thing to try and get votes for certain

44
00:02:27.621 --> 00:02:28.730
people. But I mean,

45
00:02:28.731 --> 00:02:32.180
he has spoken about it on numerous occasions and he is certainly a Washington

46
00:02:32.181 --> 00:02:34.760
insider. So I mean take what you want from that comment.

47
00:02:35.180 --> 00:02:38.000
But there have been astronauts that have talked about this take, for example,

48
00:02:38.001 --> 00:02:39.020
the late Gordon Cooper,

49
00:02:39.021 --> 00:02:42.380
who was a mercury astronaut who wrote about this in his own book, by the way,

50
00:02:42.830 --> 00:02:44.780
I know other astronauts share my feelings.

51
00:02:44.810 --> 00:02:48.380
We know the government is sitting on hard evidence of UFO's.

52
00:02:49.010 --> 00:02:52.820
He even went on to say in reference to the Roswell UFO incident,

53
00:02:53.090 --> 00:02:55.730
I had a good friend at Roswell, a fellow officer.

54
00:02:55.820 --> 00:02:58.970
He had to be careful about what he said, but it sure wasn't a weather balloon,

55
00:02:59.200 --> 00:03:00.700
like the air force cover story.

56
00:03:00.820 --> 00:03:05.290
He made it clear to me that what crashed was a craft of alien origin and members

57
00:03:05.291 --> 00:03:08.950
of the crew were recovered or even take the late Edgar Mitchell. I mean,

58
00:03:08.951 --> 00:03:10.750
this gentleman was of standup character.

59
00:03:10.751 --> 00:03:14.530
I recommend you listen to the interviews on him and his thoughts on spirituality

60
00:03:14.650 --> 00:03:15.940
and the cosmos and everything else.

61
00:03:16.120 --> 00:03:19.660
His views differ much from mainstream science. Let's just say that.

62
00:03:19.720 --> 00:03:22.930
But he did say I happened to be privileged enough to be in on the fact that we

63
00:03:22.931 --> 00:03:24.280
have been visited on this planet.

64
00:03:24.281 --> 00:03:28.030
And the UFO phenomenon is real and has been covered up by governments for quite

65
00:03:28.031 --> 00:03:29.800
some time. Now, in fact,

66
00:03:29.801 --> 00:03:33.130
he even went on to say that aliens have contacted human several times,

67
00:03:33.131 --> 00:03:36.910
but governments have hidden the knowledge or truth for 60 years,

68
00:03:37.060 --> 00:03:38.980
or even take this last quote, press pause,

69
00:03:38.981 --> 00:03:41.500
read it to I'm going to actually go into it later in this video,

70
00:03:41.501 --> 00:03:44.140
but pause it so you can read it on your own for the sake of brevity,

71
00:03:44.350 --> 00:03:47.200
but the list goes on mercury astronauts, Scott Carpenter,

72
00:03:47.440 --> 00:03:49.960
and no time when the astronauts were in space, where they alone,

73
00:03:50.140 --> 00:03:54.940
there was a constant surveillance by UFO's or even astronaut Brian O'Leary for

74
00:03:54.941 --> 00:03:58.060
nearly 50 years to secrecy apparatus within the United States.

75
00:03:58.060 --> 00:04:01.900
Government has kept from the public UFO and alien contact information.

76
00:04:02.170 --> 00:04:03.970
We have contact with alien cultures.

77
00:04:04.240 --> 00:04:06.970
Now whether you believe these people are their stories, that's on you. I mean,

78
00:04:06.971 --> 00:04:08.920
what do I know? But it was worth sharing.

79
00:04:08.921 --> 00:04:13.840
So let me jump into now these mass UFO sightings starting off with the so-called

80
00:04:13.841 --> 00:04:16.660
foo fighters that were observed during world war II,

81
00:04:17.260 --> 00:04:19.030
starting in 1944,

82
00:04:19.090 --> 00:04:22.660
at least four different countries had observed orbs,

83
00:04:22.661 --> 00:04:24.760
glowing lights of yellow, red,

84
00:04:24.761 --> 00:04:29.620
and orange color following and chasing aircraft from the United States,

85
00:04:29.740 --> 00:04:33.550
the great Britain, Nazi Germany, and even Imperial Japan.

86
00:04:33.551 --> 00:04:36.100
And I could have sworn that there was something about a fifth country,

87
00:04:36.101 --> 00:04:38.650
France or Russia. I never, I wasn't able to verify,

88
00:04:38.660 --> 00:04:41.290
I didn't spend enough time looking into it, but here's the bottom line.

89
00:04:41.680 --> 00:04:43.900
These orbs were chasing aircraft.

90
00:04:43.930 --> 00:04:46.600
They were fired on a numerous occasions to no success.

91
00:04:46.870 --> 00:04:50.620
They were quite literally able to outmaneuver machine gunfire.

92
00:04:50.800 --> 00:04:52.030
They would circle the aircraft.

93
00:04:52.120 --> 00:04:55.690
They would chase them and even follow them for as much as 30 minutes on end.

94
00:04:55.691 --> 00:05:00.190
In some cases. Now the explanation for this based on the air force is that,

95
00:05:00.191 --> 00:05:02.200
well, this was maybe ball lightening,

96
00:05:02.201 --> 00:05:04.180
which is of course an unexplained phenomena.

97
00:05:04.270 --> 00:05:07.090
And just does not add up when you consider the fact that ball lightning is a

98
00:05:07.091 --> 00:05:08.800
quick thing. And I mean,

99
00:05:08.801 --> 00:05:13.150
when you have these objects following aircraft for 30 minutes and doing circles

100
00:05:13.151 --> 00:05:14.200
around them, I mean, that's just,

101
00:05:14.230 --> 00:05:18.220
that's just not the explanation that doesn't make sense or even static discharge

102
00:05:18.221 --> 00:05:19.390
off the wingtips. In fact,

103
00:05:19.391 --> 00:05:22.810
this is the reason why we have static dischargers as you've seen on airplanes to

104
00:05:22.811 --> 00:05:25.750
allow these static to a discharge from the airplane safely,

105
00:05:26.110 --> 00:05:29.740
but that doesn't make sense either guys. I mean, come on really, you know,

106
00:05:30.040 --> 00:05:34.450
these pilots aren't stupid and they were from four different countries and the

107
00:05:34.451 --> 00:05:36.880
all thought the same thing for decades actually,

108
00:05:37.060 --> 00:05:40.480
which is that it must be top secret enemy aircraft. Well,

109
00:05:40.481 --> 00:05:43.690
that turned out not to be true. I mean, here we are 73 years later.

110
00:05:43.870 --> 00:05:47.050
And besides why don't we see this more often? Why haven't we seen this in,

111
00:05:47.290 --> 00:05:50.230
you know, I mean, how many times have you flown and you've never seen it,

112
00:05:50.231 --> 00:05:50.620
you know,

113
00:05:50.620 --> 00:05:54.370
glowing orbs of bright color chasing your aircraft are following you around or

114
00:05:54.371 --> 00:05:56.980
doing circles around the, the, the aircraft. Now,

115
00:05:56.990 --> 00:05:58.850
let me jump into the second example.

116
00:05:58.880 --> 00:06:03.440
The 1952 lights over Washington DC incident. This is pretty incredible.

117
00:06:03.740 --> 00:06:07.280
It was observed on two different radar systems from Washington national airport,

118
00:06:07.281 --> 00:06:10.280
which was the name of the airport at the time. And Andrews air force base,

119
00:06:10.460 --> 00:06:12.860
both radars at both control towers observed this.

120
00:06:13.070 --> 00:06:17.750
They had objects moving across the radar screen at over 7,000 miles an

121
00:06:17.751 --> 00:06:21.950
hour, even doing 90 degree turns at several hundred miles an hour. Oh,

122
00:06:21.951 --> 00:06:24.170
and real quick, by the way, when you research this on your own,

123
00:06:24.171 --> 00:06:28.610
this photo here is a reanimation. It's not real. It came out a few years ago.

124
00:06:28.670 --> 00:06:31.070
That's what people witnessed. That's essentially what it looked like,

125
00:06:31.250 --> 00:06:34.460
but that is not a legitimate photograph or video of it just to let you know,

126
00:06:34.670 --> 00:06:37.070
but this entire incident occurred over four nights,

127
00:06:37.340 --> 00:06:40.430
two back-to-back weekends at the end of July in 1952.

128
00:06:40.610 --> 00:06:43.640
But what makes us even more interesting is that it was observed from military

129
00:06:43.641 --> 00:06:45.920
pilots on the ground, as well as in the air,

130
00:06:46.070 --> 00:06:48.350
civilian pilots and crews on the ground,

131
00:06:48.351 --> 00:06:51.050
as well as in the air on all four different nights. In fact,

132
00:06:51.051 --> 00:06:55.070
it was so serious that they launched fighter jets, P 90 fours in fact,

133
00:06:55.190 --> 00:06:57.440
to go chase them down, but to no success,

134
00:06:57.620 --> 00:06:59.840
they were even ordered to shoot these things down,

135
00:06:59.900 --> 00:07:01.010
but they couldn't even run them down.

136
00:07:01.011 --> 00:07:04.100
They had no chance based on how fast these things were moving.

137
00:07:04.310 --> 00:07:08.420
And just like the incidents from 1944, they were described as glowing orbs.

138
00:07:08.870 --> 00:07:11.780
The even had a press conference about this at the Pentagon,

139
00:07:11.840 --> 00:07:15.680
which was the largest since world war II. And it was held by major general,

140
00:07:15.681 --> 00:07:19.940
John Sanford. Now the air force has stated multiple explanations for this.

141
00:07:19.970 --> 00:07:22.310
One of which was that what you were seeing on radar,

142
00:07:22.430 --> 00:07:26.030
even though they determined that the radar systems were functional and operating

143
00:07:26.031 --> 00:07:27.740
without air, that it must be, well,

144
00:07:27.741 --> 00:07:31.640
maybe it was related to a temperature inversion, but that's really silly.

145
00:07:31.641 --> 00:07:34.580
I mean, yeah, maybe that could cause some issues with the radar systems,

146
00:07:34.581 --> 00:07:39.320
but what about all the pilots on the ground as well as in the air four separate

147
00:07:39.321 --> 00:07:41.240
nights that witnessed these events,

148
00:07:41.300 --> 00:07:45.170
there were chasing them down to described an epic detail. So yeah,

149
00:07:45.171 --> 00:07:48.470
the temperature inversion thing is silly and it's just a distraction.

150
00:07:48.680 --> 00:07:52.040
They've even suggested that it was steamboats moving up the Potomac river,

151
00:07:52.100 --> 00:07:54.920
headed to Mount Vernon, which is just ridiculous. I mean,

152
00:07:54.921 --> 00:07:56.660
that explanation the bunks itself. I mean,

153
00:07:56.661 --> 00:07:59.450
how many pilots and crew members and people witnessed this? I mean,

154
00:07:59.451 --> 00:08:02.330
give me a break, but here's a real curve ball on their story.

155
00:08:02.540 --> 00:08:05.570
This was witnessed as far away as Franklin, Indiana,

156
00:08:05.600 --> 00:08:10.250
which is what nearly 600 miles away. So yeah, it wasn't temperature in version.

157
00:08:10.251 --> 00:08:13.520
It wasn't a steam boat. Uh, clearly we're being distracted guys.

158
00:08:13.521 --> 00:08:17.030
And this is just along the lines of what Edgar Mitchell said, quote,

159
00:08:17.090 --> 00:08:21.020
it has been the subject of disinformation in order to deflect attention and

160
00:08:21.021 --> 00:08:24.440
create confusion. So the truth doesn't come out.

161
00:08:24.650 --> 00:08:28.640
So what else could it have been? It's either aliens beings from other planets,

162
00:08:28.910 --> 00:08:31.970
ETS, wherever you want to call them or top secret technology.

163
00:08:32.510 --> 00:08:36.320
It couldn't have been the [inaudible] there's many reasons why hell even the Sr

164
00:08:36.321 --> 00:08:40.460
71 Blackbird wasn't even conceived on paper for seven years after this event.

165
00:08:40.460 --> 00:08:43.820
And it didn't have his first test flight for nearly a dozen years after that.

166
00:08:43.970 --> 00:08:45.590
But besides that, I mean, again,

167
00:08:45.591 --> 00:08:48.950
these things were observed moving at several thousand miles an hour and doing 90

168
00:08:48.951 --> 00:08:50.840
degree turns at several hundred miles an hour.

169
00:08:51.140 --> 00:08:53.540
The human body could not withstand that many GS.

170
00:08:53.630 --> 00:08:55.980
So what else could it be a drone? I mean,

171
00:08:55.981 --> 00:08:58.740
I don't know if drone technology exists today that could do those kinds of

172
00:08:58.741 --> 00:09:03.480
maneuvers if there is it's top secret, but in 1952, uh, I mean,

173
00:09:03.481 --> 00:09:06.930
if that's the case and we have been left in the dark for far longer than we ever

174
00:09:06.931 --> 00:09:10.650
thought possible. And the implications of that are well disturbing. I mean,

175
00:09:10.651 --> 00:09:14.790
here we are paying, you know, fuel at the pump record high airfare prices.

176
00:09:14.910 --> 00:09:16.110
What are based on oil and gas.

177
00:09:16.230 --> 00:09:19.680
And yet technology obviously exists that doesn't run on that if, I mean,

178
00:09:19.681 --> 00:09:21.510
if this is indeed top secret technology,

179
00:09:21.990 --> 00:09:25.350
so either it's aliens or top secret technology, either way,

180
00:09:25.590 --> 00:09:29.010
the implications are pretty disturbing. The last example is of course,

181
00:09:29.011 --> 00:09:31.320
the 1997 Phoenix lights incident,

182
00:09:31.470 --> 00:09:36.390
this incident happened on March 13th, 1997, and made headlines around the world.

183
00:09:36.510 --> 00:09:40.410
It was observed by thousands of people all the way from Henderson, Nevada,

184
00:09:40.440 --> 00:09:43.800
all the way down through, through Phoenix and Tucson, Arizona. In fact,

185
00:09:43.801 --> 00:09:48.210
there's at least 800 statements for witnesses that observed a massive triangle

186
00:09:48.480 --> 00:09:52.440
shape craft that had five lights and many say was at least a mile wide.

187
00:09:52.680 --> 00:09:55.530
They said it was absolutely silent. It moves slowly.

188
00:09:55.800 --> 00:09:59.250
And the actual sheer size of it was just breathtaking. In fact,

189
00:09:59.251 --> 00:10:03.210
even then governor five Simonton has come out in the years following stating

190
00:10:03.211 --> 00:10:07.320
that he is absolutely convinced that it was an alien craft from some other

191
00:10:07.321 --> 00:10:08.910
world. I mean, take it for what it's worth,

192
00:10:08.911 --> 00:10:11.970
but he was a captain in the air force. He later went on to become a pilot.

193
00:10:12.270 --> 00:10:15.660
But what makes this even more interesting is that the big controversy is whether

194
00:10:15.661 --> 00:10:20.220
it is military flares or not guys. That is part of the distraction.

195
00:10:20.340 --> 00:10:22.800
This is exactly what Edgar Mitchell was talking about,

196
00:10:22.801 --> 00:10:27.330
about disinformation and confusion because those flares were witnessed at what

197
00:10:27.331 --> 00:10:31.320
10:00 PM. When this whole event started as early as 6 55 in Henderson,

198
00:10:31.321 --> 00:10:35.670
Nevada was seen in Prescott valley was seen in Phoenix by thousands of people,

199
00:10:36.030 --> 00:10:38.820
hours before the flares. And by the way, look at the photo.

200
00:10:38.910 --> 00:10:40.320
You see at least seven flares,

201
00:10:40.321 --> 00:10:44.790
there were an overwhelming amount of the witnesses described five lights,

202
00:10:44.820 --> 00:10:48.900
not seven. So that whole discussion and debate on flares, not flares guys,

203
00:10:48.901 --> 00:10:49.734
it was both,

204
00:10:49.950 --> 00:10:53.550
but for people to witness this event separately during Twilight hours,

205
00:10:53.551 --> 00:10:56.970
when there was still visible light in the sky and they could actually see the

206
00:10:56.971 --> 00:10:59.820
silhouette of a plaque craft with five lights directly above them,

207
00:11:00.450 --> 00:11:05.190
what in the world was that? And as many people said, at least a mile wide. Wow.

208
00:11:05.640 --> 00:11:07.350
So what are the possibilities? Well,

209
00:11:07.410 --> 00:11:11.700
either alien craft or beings from other planets or top secret technology

210
00:11:12.270 --> 00:11:15.540
or both, if you don't buy into the alien argument, you have to ask yourself,

211
00:11:15.570 --> 00:11:19.590
well, is the top secret technology possible when you're talking in 1944, what?

212
00:11:19.591 --> 00:11:24.180
73 years ago, or 1952 lights over DC being 65 years ago,

213
00:11:24.630 --> 00:11:26.940
look into the details. Guys, come to your own conclusions.

214
00:11:26.941 --> 00:11:30.990
All I know is that the truth is stranger than fiction. I'll leave it at that.

215
00:11:31.260 --> 00:11:33.930
I'm Jimmy, this is bright insight like, and subscribe, leave me a comment.

216
00:11:33.931 --> 00:11:36.780
Let me know what your thoughts are and share any other incidences that are

217
00:11:36.781 --> 00:11:37.471
worthy of mentioned,

218
00:11:37.471 --> 00:11:39.960
because I obviously left out many others that are very compelling,

219
00:11:39.961 --> 00:11:42.630
so I'll leave it at that. Take care, everybody.
