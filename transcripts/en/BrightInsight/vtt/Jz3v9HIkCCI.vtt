00:00:03.720 --> 00:00:07.470
<v 0>Something incredibly disturbing happened to the ancient Egyptians.</v>

2
00:00:07.560 --> 00:00:08.520
And in this video,

3
00:00:08.610 --> 00:00:12.090
I'm going to share with you the mounting evidence that a cataclysmic event

4
00:00:12.450 --> 00:00:16.290
killed off the ancients that predate the dynastic Egyptians.

5
00:00:16.830 --> 00:00:17.611
For example,

6
00:00:17.611 --> 00:00:22.140
I'm going to discuss a destroyed pyramid that many who have visited the site and

7
00:00:22.141 --> 00:00:26.130
have studied megalithic structures for their career had described as looking

8
00:00:26.131 --> 00:00:30.750
like it's been blown up or even an entirely new pyramid discovered just a few

9
00:00:30.751 --> 00:00:34.530
months ago, that is in ruins and buried under the sands of Egypt.

10
00:00:34.740 --> 00:00:39.510
What on earth would it take to destroy a pyramid or even take the bent

11
00:00:39.511 --> 00:00:41.490
pyramid, for example, as I'll discuss,

12
00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:46.140
what on earth would it take to put a huge dent in a pyramid? Or how about,

13
00:00:46.141 --> 00:00:49.350
what would it take to knock down a 100 foot,

14
00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:54.480
1000 ton statue? Could it be more than just an earthquake? I mean, take,

15
00:00:54.481 --> 00:00:56.100
for example, the Colossi of Memnon,

16
00:00:56.101 --> 00:01:00.930
which we'll also discuss why on earth do they have incredible scorch marks on

17
00:01:00.931 --> 00:01:04.740
them when they're made and carved out of one solid piece of court site? I mean,

18
00:01:04.980 --> 00:01:08.160
court site melts at 3000 degrees Fahrenheit. In fact,

19
00:01:08.161 --> 00:01:12.120
they're finding sites throughout Egypt that have unusual scar and charring marks

20
00:01:12.121 --> 00:01:14.670
on the stones, which are just unexplainable.

21
00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:19.530
Is it possible that this all ties into a little known fact that the mid east is

22
00:01:19.531 --> 00:01:21.270
covered with melt glass?

23
00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:26.130
And the only thing that could have done this is atomic explosions or cosmic

24
00:01:26.131 --> 00:01:28.620
events such as air bursts or cosmic impacts.

25
00:01:28.830 --> 00:01:30.540
And I'll be discussing that in just a moment.

26
00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:34.770
Let me start off by discussing the destroyed pyramid of Jeffery located in Abra

27
00:01:35.160 --> 00:01:35.161
wash,

28
00:01:35.161 --> 00:01:39.900
which is approximately eight kilometers north of Giza mainstream archeologists

29
00:01:39.901 --> 00:01:42.990
have no explanation for this and why it's been destroyed.

30
00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:46.800
They describe it as the top half of the pyramid is just completely missing and

31
00:01:46.801 --> 00:01:47.850
is nowhere to be found.

32
00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:51.960
They speculate that the stones after being destroyed was quarried and used for

33
00:01:51.961 --> 00:01:53.940
something else. And that perhaps you debt-free,

34
00:01:53.941 --> 00:01:57.720
the Pharaoh was disliked and the essentially while literally turned his pyramid

35
00:01:57.721 --> 00:02:00.270
into ruins. But when you look at these photos here,

36
00:02:00.390 --> 00:02:03.960
something tells me that it was far more than just a mob of angry ancient

37
00:02:03.961 --> 00:02:06.390
Egyptians with bronze pickaxes. I mean,

38
00:02:06.391 --> 00:02:08.790
even take a look at photos of the internal structure. I mean,

39
00:02:08.791 --> 00:02:12.300
this thing is just clearly something incredible happened to it.

40
00:02:12.840 --> 00:02:15.990
And just to clarify, if you've seen the documentary, the pyramid code,

41
00:02:15.991 --> 00:02:18.780
which I highly recommend, you can find it on Netflix or YouTube.

42
00:02:19.320 --> 00:02:22.920
This site is not the same one that I described in a prior video about the

43
00:02:22.921 --> 00:02:24.870
unfinished pyramid of [inaudible]

44
00:02:24.870 --> 00:02:24.870
, which is the one that the Egyptian authorities have since turned into a trash dump as I described in that prior video. But no, this is not the same site that was in that documentary or visited by 

45
00:02:24.870 --> 00:02:25.703
Brian Forester, who I'll discuss in just a few moments.

46
00:02:37.620 --> 00:02:38.011
In fact,

47
00:02:38.011 --> 00:02:41.760
they're 10 miles apart and they're two totally separate locations and they have

48
00:02:41.761 --> 00:02:43.230
unique features of themselves,

49
00:02:43.260 --> 00:02:45.540
but clearly there's a lot of similarities here as well.

50
00:02:45.720 --> 00:02:47.160
But speaking of Brian Forester,

51
00:02:47.190 --> 00:02:49.710
I highly recommend that you subscribe to his channel.

52
00:02:50.040 --> 00:02:53.850
He is going to the field far more than any mainstream archeologists. I mean,

53
00:02:53.851 --> 00:02:56.010
I can't say that for certainty. He hasn't said that,

54
00:02:56.011 --> 00:03:00.280
but he goes to dozens of megalithic sites throughout the world, many countries,

55
00:03:00.281 --> 00:03:02.050
places that you never even heard of.

56
00:03:02.350 --> 00:03:06.130
And he shows you firsthand through awesome video. Tography the,

57
00:03:06.160 --> 00:03:09.490
all the evidence incredible details that have been left out of the textbooks.

58
00:03:09.610 --> 00:03:13.330
And this is the guy that inspired me to look into the topic of ancient human

59
00:03:13.331 --> 00:03:14.081
civilization.

60
00:03:14.081 --> 00:03:17.440
So you got to check him out and take a look at these screenshots that I took

61
00:03:17.441 --> 00:03:20.710
from one of his videos where he shows you these debris fields,

62
00:03:20.860 --> 00:03:24.970
as well as these unusual char marks located on stones throughout ancient Egypt.

63
00:03:25.060 --> 00:03:28.210
So definitely go check him out. Now, like I mentioned, early in the video,

64
00:03:28.300 --> 00:03:31.900
they found an entirely new pyramid just a few months ago in March of this year.

65
00:03:32.020 --> 00:03:34.720
And I actually made a video on this, but it's worth discussing again,

66
00:03:35.200 --> 00:03:39.010
this was covered by every single major news outlet throughout the world.

67
00:03:39.250 --> 00:03:41.860
And although there's so few photos of the site so far,

68
00:03:41.861 --> 00:03:45.910
because they're still excavating it, the one thing that's absolutely incredible,

69
00:03:45.911 --> 00:03:48.610
it was not even mentioned or discussed. I should say,

70
00:03:48.640 --> 00:03:51.250
in these articles is the fact that it's in ruins.

71
00:03:51.580 --> 00:03:55.390
Why on earth are they finding destroyed pyramids buried under the sands of

72
00:03:55.391 --> 00:03:59.110
Egypt? Because again, what on earth would it take to destroy a pyramid?

73
00:03:59.140 --> 00:04:02.860
And why are the mainstream archeologists and Egyptologists not making a bigger

74
00:04:02.861 --> 00:04:04.060
deal about this? I mean,

75
00:04:04.420 --> 00:04:07.960
that's an incredible thing for a pyramid to be destroyed. Is it not?

76
00:04:08.260 --> 00:04:10.030
And that brings me onto the bent pyramid.

77
00:04:10.540 --> 00:04:14.620
Mainstream will tell you that this pyramid was a design flaw that essentially

78
00:04:14.621 --> 00:04:18.640
the Egyptians were transitioning from the step pyramid over to the traditional

79
00:04:18.641 --> 00:04:20.440
looking pyramids and they simply screwed up,

80
00:04:20.770 --> 00:04:23.290
but there's so many things wrong with that theory. I mean,

81
00:04:23.291 --> 00:04:26.950
clearly you can see here that the dent in it, or the design flaws,

82
00:04:26.951 --> 00:04:28.810
they call it happens halfway up.

83
00:04:28.960 --> 00:04:32.470
So why didn't they stop fix the problem or just move on to something else

84
00:04:32.471 --> 00:04:36.760
altogether? Why did they bother finishing it? And not only did they finish it,

85
00:04:36.790 --> 00:04:39.820
they went ahead and laid all the limestone casing stones throughout the whole

86
00:04:39.821 --> 00:04:42.400
thing top to bottom. Why bother doing that?

87
00:04:42.401 --> 00:04:44.530
If you had already ruined the pyramid from the get-go,

88
00:04:44.830 --> 00:04:48.550
is it possible that this is evidence of a major cataclysmic event?

89
00:04:48.760 --> 00:04:49.720
And that reminds me,

90
00:04:49.750 --> 00:04:53.500
I have to correct myself from my prior video where I stated that the mainstream

91
00:04:53.501 --> 00:04:57.580
states that the step pyramid of Doescher came after the pyramids of Giza.

92
00:04:57.790 --> 00:05:00.880
That's not true at all. In fact, they state that it was the very first pyramid,

93
00:05:01.090 --> 00:05:05.200
but the point that I was trying to make is that there are approximately 88,

94
00:05:05.200 --> 00:05:08.200
0 known pyramids throughout Egypt. And obviously they keep finding new ones,

95
00:05:08.500 --> 00:05:10.870
but the great pyramid of Giza was built seventh,

96
00:05:10.880 --> 00:05:14.020
according to mainstream archeologists and Egyptologists.

97
00:05:14.350 --> 00:05:18.910
So after the pyramids of Giza were completed, there's about 70,

98
00:05:18.910 --> 00:05:21.640
73 other pyramids that were built after. And when you look at these,

99
00:05:21.641 --> 00:05:25.660
you'll see that none of them compare whatsoever from the precision and

100
00:05:25.661 --> 00:05:28.120
sophistication to that of the pyramids of Giza.

101
00:05:28.240 --> 00:05:31.330
So the question again is why is technology regressing?

102
00:05:31.390 --> 00:05:34.480
Why are the best pyramids, the earliest ones I should say. Now,

103
00:05:34.481 --> 00:05:39.040
let me move on to the massive statue located at the REM of Siham nearly 100 feet

104
00:05:39.041 --> 00:05:42.280
tall and weighing estimated more than 1000 tons.

105
00:05:42.670 --> 00:05:45.310
What on earth would it take to bring this thing down? I mean,

106
00:05:45.311 --> 00:05:48.040
I suppose an earthquake is a completely logical explanation,

107
00:05:48.370 --> 00:05:50.380
but just take a second to look at this thing. I mean,

108
00:05:50.381 --> 00:05:54.820
the feet themselves are up to my chest and just to put it into comparison,

109
00:05:55.120 --> 00:05:59.570
the statue of Liberty, although taller ways in a 225 tons.

110
00:05:59.600 --> 00:06:01.640
So compare that to 1000 times,

111
00:06:01.820 --> 00:06:05.450
but is it possible that some sort of cataclysmic event brought that thing down?

112
00:06:05.451 --> 00:06:07.790
I mean, look at the Colossi of Memnon, like I mentioned earlier,

113
00:06:08.030 --> 00:06:12.800
60 feet tall weighing 720 tons of piece carved

114
00:06:12.801 --> 00:06:14.750
from one solid piece of court site.

115
00:06:15.080 --> 00:06:17.540
What on earth would it take to burn that thing?

116
00:06:18.320 --> 00:06:22.580
Quartzite melts at approximately 3000 degrees Fahrenheit. So I mean, guys,

117
00:06:22.900 --> 00:06:26.840
this is something far more than some gasoline dumpster fire by an angry mob.

118
00:06:26.870 --> 00:06:30.290
I mean, just look at this thing, something incredible happened to it.

119
00:06:30.291 --> 00:06:33.920
And I made a video on this. It's one of my earlier videos and by the way,

120
00:06:34.100 --> 00:06:34.821
this stone,

121
00:06:34.821 --> 00:06:38.690
the closest site they have where quartzite could have come from is about 200

122
00:06:38.691 --> 00:06:40.580
miles away. So how on earth are,

123
00:06:40.581 --> 00:06:44.030
why on earth would they bring something so big and so heavy this far,

124
00:06:44.150 --> 00:06:46.160
but going back to the evidence of a cataclysm,

125
00:06:46.340 --> 00:06:50.180
wildly finding vast amounts of milk glass throughout the mid east,

126
00:06:50.450 --> 00:06:52.970
from Libya, Egypt, Syria,

127
00:06:53.390 --> 00:06:57.140
and this all coincides with the same exact timeframe of the younger Dryas impact

128
00:06:57.141 --> 00:06:59.840
boundary, which has found for more than three continents.

129
00:06:59.841 --> 00:07:03.170
And I would say that Africa now applies for continent number four.

130
00:07:03.650 --> 00:07:07.070
So what on earth would it take to do this either an atomic bomb,

131
00:07:07.071 --> 00:07:07.910
which I am just,

132
00:07:07.970 --> 00:07:12.860
that's not where my bet is on or an asteroid cosmic impact or an airburst.

133
00:07:12.861 --> 00:07:16.730
I mean, we all remember the air burst that happened over Russia in 2013,

134
00:07:17.000 --> 00:07:20.570
which injured 1500 people and caused an incredible amount of damage.

135
00:07:20.840 --> 00:07:24.710
And that was equivalent to about 30 times that of the strength of the Hiroshima

136
00:07:24.711 --> 00:07:29.000
bomb. Now, when we compare that to the [inaudible] event from 1908,

137
00:07:29.510 --> 00:07:34.280
that flattened more than 800 square miles of old growth forest,

138
00:07:34.480 --> 00:07:38.240
and we're talking trees 150 feet tall with incredibly deep roots.

139
00:07:38.600 --> 00:07:40.490
And every one of them practically was leveled.

140
00:07:40.580 --> 00:07:43.670
And even the evidence is still visible more than a hundred years later.

141
00:07:43.940 --> 00:07:46.010
And that, by the way, just to put it in comparison,

142
00:07:46.011 --> 00:07:50.840
registered at more than estimated 1000 times stronger than a Hiroshima bomb,

143
00:07:51.200 --> 00:07:55.340
is it possible that some sort of massive air burst an airburst from hell

144
00:07:55.580 --> 00:07:59.780
happened over ancient Egypt and just destroyed that civilization altogether?

145
00:07:59.960 --> 00:08:03.560
Clearly something incredible happened over Egypt at some point in time.

146
00:08:03.740 --> 00:08:06.860
And I highly recommend you look into the works of not just Brian Forester,

147
00:08:07.010 --> 00:08:09.800
but Graham Hancock, Randall Carlson, Robert [inaudible], uh,  John Anthony West,

148
00:08:09.800 --> 00:08:09.800
um, Christopher Dunn, Steven mailer

149
00:08:09.800 --> 00:08:09.800
. I mean, there's so many people that have inspired me to look into this subject. So you have to look into these people because I'm still learning new things every day. So if this subject interests, you definitely look into these people, but I'm going to leave it at that. I'm Jimmy, this is bright insight like, and subscribe. And I have many other videos to come on a whole wide variety of topics. Take care, everybody.
