<v 0>Hey everybody. This is Jimmy with bright insight. Get ready to be blown away,</v>

2
00:00:04.521 --> 00:00:05.040
guys,

3
00:00:05.040 --> 00:00:09.880
cuz today I'm gonna discuss with you the 100 ton stone boxes found within the

4
00:00:10.080 --> 00:00:15.000
Sierra at Sakara Egypt. Now these are completely unexplainable.

5
00:00:15.350 --> 00:00:20.280
Even the minister of antiquity for Egypt has stated on MSNBC and CNN

6
00:00:20.740 --> 00:00:24.070
that they quote do not know how these are made or how they got there.

7
00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:29.070
Now they're underground and they're found within a tunnel system of 33 nooks.

8
00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:30.270
<v 1>And within these nooks,</v>

9
00:00:30.271 --> 00:00:34.550
there are 27 boxes and each weigh approximately 100 tons,

10
00:00:34.740 --> 00:00:38.430
70 tons for the box and 30 tons for the solid lid.

11
00:00:38.690 --> 00:00:40.870
And they're made out of either granite or bass.

12
00:00:41.960 --> 00:00:46.660
Now each lid was cut from the exact same piece of stone as the box itself.

13
00:00:47.040 --> 00:00:51.740
And the precision of the way these were engineered is completely

14
00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:54.700
amazing. We're talking perfect. 90 degree angles.

15
00:00:54.880 --> 00:00:59.500
And we're also talking about being machine cut to within

16
00:00:59.920 --> 00:01:02.330
two, 10,000 of an inch.

17
00:01:02.980 --> 00:01:07.690
<v 0>Think about that for a moment. Now these were found in 1850 they're like I said,</v>

18
00:01:07.691 --> 00:01:09.130
they're completely unexplainable.

19
00:01:09.140 --> 00:01:13.370
There are some thoughts that maybe they were used as tombs for bulls and there's

20
00:01:13.371 --> 00:01:15.370
this whole elaborate story, uh, about that.

21
00:01:15.670 --> 00:01:20.530
But they were never found with any one or anything within them at all. In fact,

22
00:01:20.550 --> 00:01:24.760
all but one were found with this stones, uh, covers lids open.

23
00:01:25.180 --> 00:01:29.480
And the one that was sealed shut was actually blasted using gun powder,

24
00:01:29.570 --> 00:01:30.800
which is very unfortunate.

25
00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:34.200
But what's interesting about this is that even though it was sealed shut,

26
00:01:34.430 --> 00:01:36.680
when they blasted it open, they found nothing.

27
00:01:37.580 --> 00:01:41.160
Now there's also evidence that the inscriptions that you can see here on the

28
00:01:41.161 --> 00:01:44.790
outside of the lids were done after the boxes were made.

29
00:01:44.810 --> 00:01:47.430
So it's widely believed that these boxes were,

30
00:01:47.540 --> 00:01:52.510
were constructed before the dynastic Egyptians and that perhaps the dynastic

31
00:01:52.511 --> 00:01:56.030
Egyptians went in there carved different, uh, you know,

32
00:01:56.730 --> 00:01:59.870
as you can see different writings and shapes and, and, and of animals on them,

33
00:01:59.960 --> 00:02:00.870
which by the way,

34
00:02:01.140 --> 00:02:04.980
does not compare at all to the precision of the boxes themselves. In fact,

35
00:02:05.120 --> 00:02:05.953
it looks like the,

36
00:02:05.960 --> 00:02:10.700
the actual inscriptions were done very roughly in anything that's, uh,

37
00:02:10.840 --> 00:02:14.020
you know, analyzed up close. You can see it for yourself. Now.

38
00:02:14.021 --> 00:02:17.260
It's important for me to mention that I've been inspired and first learned of

39
00:02:17.261 --> 00:02:19.940
these through Brian Forester, who has a YouTube channel.

40
00:02:20.160 --> 00:02:23.460
And he also has a website called hidden Inca tours.com.

41
00:02:24.410 --> 00:02:27.530
I highly recommend you look into him because this guy is absolutely brilliant.

42
00:02:28.150 --> 00:02:32.810
And what he's doing is just phenomenal because this is opening a whole Pandora's

43
00:02:32.811 --> 00:02:34.450
box for showing that yes,

44
00:02:34.451 --> 00:02:37.930
there is lost ancient high technology that was utilized to construct these

45
00:02:38.060 --> 00:02:39.050
boxes. Now,

46
00:02:39.051 --> 00:02:43.050
something that's worth mentioning that is completely unexplainable as well is

47
00:02:43.051 --> 00:02:46.520
the fact that these boxes are located within their own little nooks.

48
00:02:46.521 --> 00:02:50.920
And one of these nooks where the box is found in based on the dimensions of the

49
00:02:50.921 --> 00:02:53.360
box, and we're talking 15 feet long, 10 feet tall,

50
00:02:53.361 --> 00:02:58.280
absolutely huge could not have fit around the corner of one of these tunnels and

51
00:02:58.281 --> 00:02:59.320
into the nook where it's place.

52
00:02:59.460 --> 00:03:03.160
Now they have no idea how it got there could not have fit. And again,

53
00:03:03.161 --> 00:03:08.000
these are underground. So what was, were they placed there before the,

54
00:03:08.100 --> 00:03:11.480
you know, it was sealed like what it's unexplainable, how did they get there?

55
00:03:11.500 --> 00:03:13.400
We don't know. I could throw out some ideas,

56
00:03:13.500 --> 00:03:15.040
but that's for another video in itself.

57
00:03:15.740 --> 00:03:20.070
What's important to understand here is even if you wanted to believe the common

58
00:03:20.150 --> 00:03:24.230
Egyptian, you know, thesis, which is that okay, the head slaves do everything.

59
00:03:24.540 --> 00:03:27.350
Even if these things were a fraction of the weight to just put this in

60
00:03:27.351 --> 00:03:30.750
perspective, 100 tons is 200,000 pounds.

61
00:03:31.370 --> 00:03:35.910
How you couldn't get enough hands of people around these boxes to physically

62
00:03:35.920 --> 00:03:40.060
carry 'em and place them where they're at. How could you even roll them? I mean,

63
00:03:40.061 --> 00:03:44.900
we're talking 200,000 pounds seriously. Guys think about that.

64
00:03:45.210 --> 00:03:48.900
It's it is believed and hypothesized that perhaps these were used for some sort

65
00:03:48.901 --> 00:03:51.660
of electricity or power generating. I mean, look,

66
00:03:51.730 --> 00:03:55.260
it's obviously with a technology that we don't know or understand today,

67
00:03:55.480 --> 00:03:59.340
but these things clearly had purpose that were clearly in my opinion,

68
00:03:59.530 --> 00:04:03.410
industrial, uh, you know, in some way, because they're, they're clearly placed.

69
00:04:03.480 --> 00:04:05.850
It's easy for someone to think that maybe this was a tomb,

70
00:04:06.110 --> 00:04:10.970
but why is it that they were empty and why go to such enormous extent to create

71
00:04:10.971 --> 00:04:15.770
something so big, so heavy and within such amazing precision, cuz like I said,

72
00:04:15.771 --> 00:04:19.850
within two, 10 thousands of an inch of being flat. Wow.

73
00:04:20.780 --> 00:04:22.800
So when you look at all this, you know,

74
00:04:22.801 --> 00:04:26.040
there's clear evidence that this was done with some sort of capability or

75
00:04:26.041 --> 00:04:30.560
technology that we don't have today or that was on par

76
00:04:30.900 --> 00:04:32.600
of which we do have today.

77
00:04:33.020 --> 00:04:36.520
And what makes us so interesting is that this was done thousands of years ago

78
00:04:36.820 --> 00:04:41.030
and we have no idea how they were done. Anyways, guys, look at the pictures,

79
00:04:41.250 --> 00:04:42.230
decide for yourself.

80
00:04:42.460 --> 00:04:45.390
It's clear evidence that what we have been taught and what we think of ancient

81
00:04:45.460 --> 00:04:50.150
history is far from the truth. Anyways, I'm Jimmy, this is bright insight.

82
00:04:50.151 --> 00:04:52.150
