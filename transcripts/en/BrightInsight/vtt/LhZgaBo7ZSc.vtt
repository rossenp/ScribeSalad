00:00:01.830 --> 00:00:04.610
<v 0>The Osirion located in Abydos, Egypt,</v>

2
00:00:04.611 --> 00:00:09.250
approximately 340 miles south of the great pyramid of Giza is just

3
00:00:09.251 --> 00:00:13.410
another example of a prehistoric civilization, because make no mistake,

4
00:00:13.730 --> 00:00:15.610
the people living in Egypt a few thousand years ago,

5
00:00:15.640 --> 00:00:19.210
also known as the ancient Egyptians could not have constructed this site.

6
00:00:19.390 --> 00:00:23.400
In fact, there's zero physical or scientific and even suggest that they did.

7
00:00:23.620 --> 00:00:27.320
And as you can see here, this place is absolutely incredible.

8
00:00:27.950 --> 00:00:32.520
It's very hard to appreciate just how massive these granite blocks are until you

9
00:00:32.521 --> 00:00:33.760
have people standing next to them,

10
00:00:33.761 --> 00:00:37.600
which is a very rare find in any picture because tours of this site ended years

11
00:00:37.700 --> 00:00:41.360
ago due to flooding. And this site has been flooded time and time again,

12
00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:44.270
ever since it was, is rediscovered. In fact, when they did find it,

13
00:00:44.271 --> 00:00:48.310
it was buried. And as you can see here, here's a layout or a map of the site,

14
00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:50.510
which of course is referred to as a temple.

15
00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:53.430
Isn't it funny how everything from ancient times is always a temple.

16
00:00:53.890 --> 00:00:56.870
You also have to consider that when you look at this site, it once had a roof.

17
00:00:56.930 --> 00:00:59.230
In fact, an incredibly impressive roof system,

18
00:00:59.770 --> 00:01:01.150
as you can see evidence of it here,

19
00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:04.540
but it was even double layer as I'll be discussing here shortly.

20
00:01:04.720 --> 00:01:08.740
You can also see the doorways as this site contains about a dozen chambers of

21
00:01:08.741 --> 00:01:12.140
some kind. And there are very few photos at all in existence of this.

22
00:01:12.141 --> 00:01:14.900
And these are the only few that I could find. And unfortunately,

23
00:01:15.380 --> 00:01:17.620
there's very little information about this ancient site,

24
00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:20.740
but there's different artists renditions of what it may have looked like before

25
00:01:20.741 --> 00:01:23.260
it deteriorated or fell apart or was destroyed.

26
00:01:23.950 --> 00:01:28.490
You can see that there's some sort of oval arch type circular structure to the

27
00:01:28.491 --> 00:01:29.051
roofing system.

28
00:01:29.051 --> 00:01:31.410
And you can see some evidence here in this black and white photo,

29
00:01:31.750 --> 00:01:36.490
but one of the truly amazing things about it is the size and the weight of these

30
00:01:36.491 --> 00:01:37.270
granite blocks.

31
00:01:37.270 --> 00:01:41.450
And you can compare here as you see these other pillars next to comparison of

32
00:01:41.451 --> 00:01:45.280
the door, and this is a normal size door. So when you look at these photos,

33
00:01:46.060 --> 00:01:50.600
you don't realize that many of these pillars are eight feet by eight feet by 12

34
00:01:50.630 --> 00:01:51.480
feet in height.

35
00:01:51.820 --> 00:01:56.040
And it has been estimated by engineers that with those measurements eight by

36
00:01:56.041 --> 00:01:57.320
eight by 12, and assuming

37
00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:01.120
175 pounds per cubic feet for the weight of granite,

38
00:02:01.750 --> 00:02:05.310
that these pillars are approximately seven tons,

39
00:02:08.190 --> 00:02:09.670
134,000 pounds a piece.

40
00:02:09.930 --> 00:02:13.910
And what makes it even crazier is the fact that these were coed from the Swan

41
00:02:14.350 --> 00:02:16.670
quarry 200 miles away.

42
00:02:17.170 --> 00:02:20.550
So how they move these from 200 miles away is obviously a mystery and there are

43
00:02:20.551 --> 00:02:21.990
different theories on how they could have done this,

44
00:02:22.730 --> 00:02:26.420
but what makes it even more interesting how they lifted them into place?

45
00:02:26.800 --> 00:02:27.780
As you can see here,

46
00:02:28.050 --> 00:02:31.420
they had interlocking wedges as they stacked them on top of each other.

47
00:02:31.640 --> 00:02:36.260
And upon a closer look, this roofing system was double layered,

48
00:02:36.261 --> 00:02:39.580
which is incredible. Considering just how massive these blocks are.

49
00:02:39.680 --> 00:02:42.820
And then they doubled them up. Why on earth would they do that? I mean,

50
00:02:42.821 --> 00:02:47.530
was this some sort of bomb shelter suggest that this is a temple for praying

51
00:02:48.190 --> 00:02:51.610
and to create a roofing system like this and these pillars that are as big as

52
00:02:51.611 --> 00:02:54.610
they are. I think there's more to this story, but like I said,

53
00:02:54.611 --> 00:02:55.530
at the beginning of this video,

54
00:02:55.760 --> 00:02:59.960
there's zero physical or scientific evidence to support that the ancient

55
00:02:59.961 --> 00:03:03.760
Egyptians had constructed this site. They did not have the tooling.

56
00:03:04.290 --> 00:03:08.680
These are examples of the bronze and copper saws that the ancient Egyptians did

57
00:03:08.681 --> 00:03:11.400
have as we found through various archeological digs.

58
00:03:11.500 --> 00:03:12.600
But as you can see in this photo,

59
00:03:12.601 --> 00:03:16.160
this is the best example of an Egyptian saw that is remaining. In fact,

60
00:03:16.161 --> 00:03:19.670
there's so few that have ever been found, but when you look at the measurements,

61
00:03:19.671 --> 00:03:21.670
which I don't have, but just compare it to the handle,

62
00:03:22.130 --> 00:03:24.870
the blade itself must be less than two feet in length.

63
00:03:25.370 --> 00:03:30.350
So how on earth could the Egyptians have cut a 12 foot by eight by

64
00:03:30.351 --> 00:03:34.710
eight granite block with something so small mainstream Egyptologists and

65
00:03:34.711 --> 00:03:38.150
archeologists come up with various theories on saws that they must have had even

66
00:03:38.151 --> 00:03:41.100
saying that some of them may have been as big as 15 feet long,

67
00:03:41.840 --> 00:03:44.340
but when you look at evidence, well, there is none.

68
00:03:44.341 --> 00:03:49.100
There's not a single saw larger than the one I just showed you in any kind ever

69
00:03:49.101 --> 00:03:52.060
found throughout ancient and Egypt, nor are there any type of pictures,

70
00:03:52.061 --> 00:03:52.701
hieroglyphs,

71
00:03:52.701 --> 00:03:56.500
or petroglyphs that annotate any type of saw larger than what you just found.

72
00:03:56.520 --> 00:03:57.240
In fact,

73
00:03:57.240 --> 00:04:02.010
the only examples of picture that I have found from ancient Egypt are these two,

74
00:04:02.220 --> 00:04:06.130
which clearly show that same type of saw cutting wood,

75
00:04:06.630 --> 00:04:09.770
not cutting stone. And when these methods have been tested,

76
00:04:09.960 --> 00:04:12.330
they have failed miserably. No joke,

77
00:04:12.350 --> 00:04:15.730
the best supporting theory that Egyptologists and archeologists have are bronze

78
00:04:15.980 --> 00:04:18.730
slash copper saws. Look at this quick video,

79
00:04:18.760 --> 00:04:22.240
it's less than a minute long where you see mark Laneer himself on leading

80
00:04:22.470 --> 00:04:25.560
authorities on ancient Egypt. Try to demonstrate this,

81
00:04:26.060 --> 00:04:28.760
to support the argument that this is what the Egyptians used.

82
00:04:29.390 --> 00:04:30.840
Just watch this video real quick.

83
00:04:31.880 --> 00:04:33.600
<v 1>All right. We have a big block of granite here.</v>

84
00:04:33.820 --> 00:04:36.640
So how's this copper gonna cut this granite, even.

85
00:04:36.640 --> 00:04:40.480
<v 2>With teeth, the copper alone is too soft. We're going to,</v>

86
00:04:40.750 --> 00:04:45.150
to put sand inside the groove and we're going to put this so on top of the sand

87
00:04:45.650 --> 00:04:47.390
and then let the sand do the cutting.

88
00:04:50.350 --> 00:04:53.990
<v 1>Now, Dennis, will we see any progress in our lifetime? Yes.</v>

89
00:04:54.430 --> 00:04:56.510
<v 2>Um, if you came back in an hour time,</v>

90
00:04:56.650 --> 00:04:59.670
you would see about a four millimeter crop down.

91
00:04:59.740 --> 00:05:03.540
<v 1>Into the film. You're kidding. An hour, you'll be four millimeters down. Well.</v>

92
00:05:03.610 --> 00:05:07.700
<v 2>I've been doing a lot of experiments and I can guarantee that this will cook</v>

93
00:05:07.980 --> 00:05:10.620
through the stone. That's about four millimeters an hour.

94
00:05:15.260 --> 00:05:19.660
<v 3>The so went wonderful. Once we switched over to using, uh, water with the sand,</v>

95
00:05:20.280 --> 00:05:23.610
as you can see here, we achieved this in just a few days.

96
00:05:25.600 --> 00:05:27.890
<v 0>Four millimeters an hour. Are you joking?</v>

97
00:05:28.190 --> 00:05:30.290
And although it went quicker with water, what does that mean?

98
00:05:30.510 --> 00:05:32.930
Was it twice as fast? Was it eight millimeters an hour?

99
00:05:33.350 --> 00:05:37.250
Did they even get an inch an hour? Because according to the demonstration,

100
00:05:37.390 --> 00:05:40.650
it could not have, and again, they have never found a saw this big.

101
00:05:40.760 --> 00:05:44.360
They didn't find one with these tee marks on it either. And it failed miserably.

102
00:05:44.900 --> 00:05:47.440
And even if it had worked in a, at a rate of speed,

103
00:05:47.530 --> 00:05:50.600
would the precision have been there because these stone blocks are unbelievably

104
00:05:50.601 --> 00:05:53.360
precise and all the other methods outlined by Egyptologists,

105
00:05:53.361 --> 00:05:55.720
whether it be bronze, chisels, stone hammers,

106
00:05:55.950 --> 00:05:58.960
none of these methods could work for this site, not even close.

107
00:05:59.220 --> 00:06:02.080
Now I'm not saying that the ancient Egyptians could not have done impressive

108
00:06:02.081 --> 00:06:04.240
things. I mean, take, for example, the temple of Hathor,

109
00:06:04.530 --> 00:06:08.040
which is unbelievably impressive. And I'm gonna make a video on this as well.

110
00:06:08.160 --> 00:06:09.480
I have to do more research on it,

111
00:06:09.700 --> 00:06:13.000
but it seems to me that the ancient Egyptians did construct this site. I again,

112
00:06:13.001 --> 00:06:16.790
have to do more research, look how huge these pillars are compared to people,

113
00:06:17.690 --> 00:06:20.190
but keep in mind that these are made of limestone,

114
00:06:20.191 --> 00:06:24.750
which is significantly easier to cut than granite as well as far less heavy,

115
00:06:25.570 --> 00:06:28.870
but this is how they did it. They did it in sections, which is very,

116
00:06:28.871 --> 00:06:32.070
very similar to how the ancient Greeks did this with the Greek columns.

117
00:06:32.071 --> 00:06:33.470
As you can see upon a closer look,

118
00:06:33.700 --> 00:06:36.950
that those were divided up into sections as well. So although the,

119
00:06:37.040 --> 00:06:39.300
the temple of haw is unbelievably impressive,

120
00:06:39.680 --> 00:06:43.460
it still does not compare to what it would take to cut and carve these stones

121
00:06:43.461 --> 00:06:46.340
located at the Sirion. So while doing research for this video,

122
00:06:46.620 --> 00:06:50.460
I came across a video from Chuck, the YouTuber CFAs 7, 8 65,

123
00:06:50.461 --> 00:06:54.500
who have mentioned before, and he outlined an awesome detail instantly.

124
00:06:54.530 --> 00:06:58.250
This article that came out, as you can see here, not even what two weeks ago,

125
00:06:58.920 --> 00:07:02.290
stating that this same location at ADOS in Egypt,

126
00:07:02.640 --> 00:07:05.690
they have found evidence of through an archeological dig,

127
00:07:05.870 --> 00:07:10.850
dating back 7,000 years. And this article does a few things wrong. One,

128
00:07:11.080 --> 00:07:13.450
they state that it can be traced back to the first dynasty,

129
00:07:13.451 --> 00:07:15.890
which Chuck immediately picked up on and realized that no,

130
00:07:16.200 --> 00:07:18.640
according to all the textbooks and everything we've been taught,

131
00:07:18.660 --> 00:07:22.760
the first dynasty of Egypt starts at 5,000 years ago. So all of a sudden,

132
00:07:23.460 --> 00:07:26.760
2000 years before that, and it's like not a big deal. I mean,

133
00:07:26.761 --> 00:07:30.080
that's 2000 years earlier than anything we've known about ancient Egypt,

134
00:07:30.270 --> 00:07:32.560
even a thousand years into pre-history,

135
00:07:32.561 --> 00:07:36.360
as we all know that the Sumerians history starts with them at 6,000 years ago,

136
00:07:36.820 --> 00:07:41.110
he also noticed the water erosion on the limestone enclosure around this

137
00:07:41.350 --> 00:07:43.870
facility. Very, very similar to that, of the great Finks,

138
00:07:43.920 --> 00:07:48.710
which proves the date being significantly older, but again, ADOS,

139
00:07:48.711 --> 00:07:52.910
Egypt, the ASION and the 7,000 year old evidence. So in other words,

140
00:07:53.300 --> 00:07:56.190
there's already proof that people were living here thousands of years,

141
00:07:56.450 --> 00:07:57.430
to what they already thought,

142
00:07:57.431 --> 00:08:00.860
further evidence that this was done by a prehistoric civilization,

143
00:08:01.290 --> 00:08:05.940
take a look at these photos from the back wall of the ASION look at these

144
00:08:05.941 --> 00:08:08.860
various cut marks and how they closely resemble.

145
00:08:08.880 --> 00:08:12.060
As you now see here from Cusco, Peru,

146
00:08:12.890 --> 00:08:15.780
look at the type of cut marks there and how similar they are,

147
00:08:16.600 --> 00:08:18.020
but it goes even further than that.

148
00:08:18.450 --> 00:08:22.490
Look at these various marks that you find from Cusco to Egypt,

149
00:08:22.710 --> 00:08:26.010
as well as up in Machu Pichu, which is very, very similar.

150
00:08:26.230 --> 00:08:30.170
As you can see from these knob marks located right here at the ASION. I mean,

151
00:08:30.171 --> 00:08:33.330
is this all a coincidence because there's actually more evidence that would

152
00:08:33.331 --> 00:08:36.530
support that. It's not a coincidence in that they were a global civilization.

153
00:08:37.160 --> 00:08:41.880
Look at these similarities here between Machu P you and Egypt here

154
00:08:41.980 --> 00:08:46.120
at the ASION and look at just how far away that is separated by the Atlantic

155
00:08:46.130 --> 00:08:50.480
ocean practically on the other side of the planet and the similarities don't

156
00:08:50.481 --> 00:08:51.314
stop there,

157
00:08:51.350 --> 00:08:54.680
whether it's comparison of the various types of doors and structures that they

158
00:08:54.700 --> 00:08:59.000
use the use of trapezoidal doors, the similarities of structures. I mean,

159
00:08:59.001 --> 00:09:02.120
look at the shape of the buildings. I mean, is that just a coincidence,

160
00:09:02.980 --> 00:09:06.960
the shape of the cut marks or even just the very use of pyramids across multiple

161
00:09:07.050 --> 00:09:09.720
continents? Look at these photos right here.

162
00:09:10.010 --> 00:09:12.160
Isn't there a clear difference between this stone wall,

163
00:09:12.161 --> 00:09:14.080
which clearly has utilized mortar mud mortar.

164
00:09:14.510 --> 00:09:18.910
And this is located right here in Peru at Cusco and this other Stonewall located

165
00:09:18.911 --> 00:09:20.630
at the very same site, the same street,

166
00:09:20.920 --> 00:09:24.030
there is absolute evidence of two different civilizations,

167
00:09:24.490 --> 00:09:27.790
and you can look at other examples here at Machu Pichu, how they essentially,

168
00:09:28.090 --> 00:09:30.470
the newer civilization built on top of the older,

169
00:09:30.650 --> 00:09:34.110
but this is evidence that the older civilization was more advanced.

170
00:09:34.450 --> 00:09:36.340
And when you go back over to the ASION,

171
00:09:36.341 --> 00:09:38.980
you can see the clear difference as it connects to the temple of SETI.

172
00:09:39.560 --> 00:09:41.700
The absolute difference between these sites,

173
00:09:42.000 --> 00:09:45.380
the two completely different types of technology that were utilized to construct

174
00:09:45.381 --> 00:09:47.780
it and to make it even more interesting.

175
00:09:47.920 --> 00:09:50.340
The ASION sits lower than the rest of the site.

176
00:09:50.370 --> 00:09:53.860
It's almost as if it's sunken down or it was built so long ago,

177
00:09:53.861 --> 00:09:58.090
as we know that things that are older are further down underground and the newer

178
00:09:58.091 --> 00:10:00.090
things at the top, right. Makes perfect sense.

179
00:10:00.310 --> 00:10:03.490
And that's exactly what you're seeing here. So here's what it comes down to.

180
00:10:03.491 --> 00:10:07.010
As I close this up, that people living in Egypt a few thousand years ago,

181
00:10:07.260 --> 00:10:11.330
could not have built this site. There's zero evidence to support it. Now,

182
00:10:11.350 --> 00:10:15.730
one single tool has ever been found ever to support that they could have cut

183
00:10:16.060 --> 00:10:18.000
blocks especially of this size,

184
00:10:18.860 --> 00:10:21.920
nor have they ever found any type of wall painting of any kind to even suggest

185
00:10:21.921 --> 00:10:23.680
that they did have it. And we just haven't found it.

186
00:10:23.900 --> 00:10:28.280
We have to start connecting the dots on these coincidences between the Incas or

187
00:10:28.281 --> 00:10:30.440
the pre ins I should say. And the Egyptians,

188
00:10:30.870 --> 00:10:34.200
clearly this is further evidence that there was a global civilization that

189
00:10:34.201 --> 00:10:38.590
existed tens of thousands of years ago. The evidence of this is long since gone,

190
00:10:38.591 --> 00:10:41.230
except for the stone structures that we see today. Again,

191
00:10:41.231 --> 00:10:43.990
there's more information about this site that I'll be researching and looking

192
00:10:44.020 --> 00:10:47.190
into. So look forward to a part two, but I'll wrap it up there.

193
00:10:47.191 --> 00:10:49.630
Leave me a comment. Let me know what your thoughts are. I'm Jimmy,

194
00:10:49.780 --> 00:10:52.870
this is bright insight. I can subscribe and take care of everybody.
