00:00:02.870 --> 00:00:05.450
<v 0>There has long been speculation of tunnels,</v>

2
00:00:05.451 --> 00:00:08.810
shafts and chambers within the great Sphinx and underneath it,

3
00:00:09.110 --> 00:00:12.800
including the possibility of a hall of records in this video,

4
00:00:12.950 --> 00:00:16.700
I'm going to share with you several key pieces of evidence that prove that not

5
00:00:16.701 --> 00:00:19.880
only do these tunnels, shafts and chambers exist,

6
00:00:20.180 --> 00:00:23.990
but there is an active attempt on behalf of the Egyptian authorities to prevent

7
00:00:23.991 --> 00:00:26.270
the citizens of the world from knowing about it.

8
00:00:26.930 --> 00:00:30.770
Let me start off by addressing the conspiracy that there is some sort of shaft

9
00:00:31.490 --> 00:00:33.200
door at the top of the sphinxes head.

10
00:00:33.350 --> 00:00:36.740
At least that's what many people have referred to it. As various articles,

11
00:00:36.890 --> 00:00:39.380
I've looked at videos online about this, and you leave,

12
00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:42.140
you see people leaving comments saying that, no, this is CGI.

13
00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:46.550
There's no door at the top. That's non-existent, it's just a color fluctuation.

14
00:00:46.551 --> 00:00:50.150
And it means nothing. So I decided to go looking into this for myself.

15
00:00:50.300 --> 00:00:54.350
And I looked through Google images and realize that there are so few aerial

16
00:00:54.351 --> 00:00:55.430
photos of the Sphinx.

17
00:00:55.431 --> 00:00:58.520
Apparently the Egyptian authorities do not allow people to fly over it.

18
00:00:58.940 --> 00:01:03.170
So I went to Google maps and that was useless because as you see in the largest

19
00:01:03.171 --> 00:01:05.810
photo here, that is as far as you can zoom in.

20
00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:10.070
So I cropped the photograph where I took a screenshot, cropped it. And I mean,

21
00:01:10.071 --> 00:01:12.620
yeah, you can kind of see a white blemish there, but I mean,

22
00:01:12.621 --> 00:01:13.580
what does this do for me?

23
00:01:13.820 --> 00:01:16.790
So I went over to the Google earth app and look at that,

24
00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:19.160
what that is just useless. It's animated. I mean,

25
00:01:19.161 --> 00:01:22.130
what am I supposed to do with this? And it didn't always use to be this way.

26
00:01:22.310 --> 00:01:26.090
So I decided to go back to Google images and do a ton of different searches.

27
00:01:26.091 --> 00:01:30.050
I got really creative and I did find a photo from 1925.

28
00:01:30.350 --> 00:01:33.140
And as you can see here, I mean, there's a guy standing in it,

29
00:01:33.170 --> 00:01:37.370
but is this what a four or five foot deep cavity? Is it a shaft?

30
00:01:37.371 --> 00:01:41.300
Does it go anywhere? It really doesn't show us much. But then I hit the jackpot.

31
00:01:41.360 --> 00:01:43.640
I don't think anyone watching this has seen these photos.

32
00:01:43.641 --> 00:01:47.510
So there's a photographer who is doing a story with the New York times back in

33
00:01:47.511 --> 00:01:50.930
may of 1990. And as you can see in this photo here, yes,

34
00:01:50.931 --> 00:01:54.020
that is Dr. Zahi Hiawassee himself in the middle there,

35
00:01:54.440 --> 00:01:58.250
but pay close attention to the scaffolding over at the top of the sphinxes head

36
00:01:58.670 --> 00:02:03.050
because in this next photo, well, just take a look for it and see for yourself.

37
00:02:03.650 --> 00:02:07.670
Look at that. What is that now? I don't know what else there is.

38
00:02:07.730 --> 00:02:09.530
The photographer doesn't point down there.

39
00:02:09.531 --> 00:02:12.920
This is all you can see there's a hatch, but does it go anywhere?

40
00:02:12.950 --> 00:02:16.130
Is there any possibility that it's related to the imaging,

41
00:02:16.131 --> 00:02:20.180
the ground-penetrating radar that has discovered some sort of cavities within

42
00:02:20.181 --> 00:02:23.660
the Sphinx? Could it lead to the so-called chamber at the pod,

43
00:02:23.710 --> 00:02:25.730
the Sphinx as I'll be discussing here shortly,

44
00:02:25.850 --> 00:02:29.330
there's obviously not enough information here to make any type of conclusion,

45
00:02:29.750 --> 00:02:32.240
but clearly, no, this is not CGI.

46
00:02:32.540 --> 00:02:36.590
And I find it really interesting that the Egyptian authorities have done so much

47
00:02:36.591 --> 00:02:39.140
to prevent anyone from knowing about this in the first place.

48
00:02:39.410 --> 00:02:42.680
Now there has been other speculation. And this brings me to my second example,

49
00:02:42.681 --> 00:02:46.430
that there is some sort of shaft door at the top of the sphinxes back towards

50
00:02:46.431 --> 00:02:47.870
the rear. And in fact,

51
00:02:48.390 --> 00:02:53.390
Zahid was actually took people up there with a camera in 2009. And yeah,

52
00:02:53.391 --> 00:02:54.860
this, this shaft door exists.

53
00:02:54.890 --> 00:02:58.760
He opens it up on video and I'll include a link for the video in the description

54
00:02:58.761 --> 00:03:01.450
here it's and a half minutes long. You definitely need to watch it,

55
00:03:01.870 --> 00:03:02.830
but he opens up the door.

56
00:03:02.831 --> 00:03:07.210
He points down and clearly you can see that at the bottom. I mean,

57
00:03:07.211 --> 00:03:10.810
it goes someplace. You can tell from the shadows, which direction does it go?

58
00:03:10.811 --> 00:03:13.090
I have no idea. He himself say,

59
00:03:13.210 --> 00:03:15.760
it says that it leads nowhere and you go down there and there's nothing to be

60
00:03:15.761 --> 00:03:19.000
seen. He says that people probably dug it out at some point, uh,

61
00:03:19.030 --> 00:03:22.590
looking for treasures. Why not just put a camera attached,

62
00:03:22.591 --> 00:03:24.580
a rope to a camera and lower it down. Let us see.

63
00:03:24.790 --> 00:03:28.090
You can tell that it goes in some directions. So which direction does it go?

64
00:03:28.450 --> 00:03:32.050
It's fine if there's nothing down there, but at least show us a photograph,

65
00:03:32.051 --> 00:03:36.640
show us an image of some kind. Why is it such a secret? And don't forget,

66
00:03:37.090 --> 00:03:40.930
Zahid GWAS had denied for decades that there was ever tunnels underneath the

67
00:03:40.931 --> 00:03:42.730
Sphinx or in the Sphinx itself.

68
00:03:42.880 --> 00:03:46.960
And he had actually changed his story multiple times as I'll discuss later in

69
00:03:46.961 --> 00:03:48.700
this video, but it raises questions.

70
00:03:48.701 --> 00:03:52.600
Could this lead to the cavities within the Sphinx or the detected cavity at

71
00:03:52.601 --> 00:03:54.430
below it. I mean, guys,

72
00:03:54.431 --> 00:03:57.010
ground-penetrating radar has shown that there's something there,

73
00:03:57.570 --> 00:03:59.320
but let me go on to the next example,

74
00:03:59.350 --> 00:04:04.210
which is this infamous shaft tunnel doorway at the base of the Spanx at the

75
00:04:04.211 --> 00:04:08.080
rear to the left of the tail. So look at these photos here,

76
00:04:08.081 --> 00:04:10.930
anyone that's visited the site, you can't see what's down there.

77
00:04:10.931 --> 00:04:12.640
It goes to the left. It's too dark.

78
00:04:12.820 --> 00:04:17.560
But Dr. Zahi wast himself in the same video as him going to the sphinxes

79
00:04:17.561 --> 00:04:19.030
back and showing you that tunnel,

80
00:04:19.360 --> 00:04:22.690
he actually goes down into this chamber and that through this shaft,

81
00:04:23.080 --> 00:04:27.130
and he takes a camera guy with him and Zahi himself in this video states that it

82
00:04:27.131 --> 00:04:30.700
doesn't go anywhere that he's excavated it. And there's nothing to be seen,

83
00:04:31.150 --> 00:04:34.990
but the camera man doesn't even point the camera in the opposite direction.

84
00:04:34.991 --> 00:04:37.210
Just, I mean, clearly it goes somewhere, right?

85
00:04:37.420 --> 00:04:41.350
How difficult would it be to have the man turn around point a flashlight and let

86
00:04:41.351 --> 00:04:44.320
us see what's in there? Which direction does it go? Okay.

87
00:04:44.321 --> 00:04:46.930
You say there's nothing in there, but at least let us see the nothing.

88
00:04:47.140 --> 00:04:51.190
Why is there not one single photo or video available to the public that shows

89
00:04:51.191 --> 00:04:52.450
anything beyond this point?

90
00:04:52.451 --> 00:04:54.730
And most people don't even know that this exists in itself.

91
00:04:54.970 --> 00:04:58.930
What's interesting about this is that in the 1970s, a stone block came loose.

92
00:04:58.931 --> 00:05:01.750
So they began an excavation where mark Lainer was part of it,

93
00:05:01.751 --> 00:05:04.360
a very close associate of [inaudible] for decades.

94
00:05:04.870 --> 00:05:08.860
They spent three weeks excavating this tunnel shaft.

95
00:05:09.280 --> 00:05:12.340
The [inaudible] says goes nowhere. And there's nothing in it. I mean,

96
00:05:12.341 --> 00:05:14.950
I know that excavations take some time, but three weeks,

97
00:05:15.010 --> 00:05:18.340
if it went nowhere and there was nothing in it and they decided to go ahead and

98
00:05:18.341 --> 00:05:22.510
shroud it in the process where nobody could see what they were doing. Okay.

99
00:05:22.930 --> 00:05:25.630
And not to mention stories, go back centuries,

100
00:05:25.631 --> 00:05:28.690
that there is a tunnel system that connects the great Sphinx and the hall of

101
00:05:28.691 --> 00:05:32.380
records to the pyramids. Could this lead to that?

102
00:05:32.740 --> 00:05:36.280
Now the next example I want to discuss involves with ground penetrating radar

103
00:05:36.281 --> 00:05:40.870
has discovered as a cavity of some kind a chamber underneath the pod,

104
00:05:40.871 --> 00:05:41.704
the Sphinx,

105
00:05:41.830 --> 00:05:45.190
and this is something that's been discussed by John Anthony West Robert shock,

106
00:05:45.400 --> 00:05:49.240
but [inaudible] took a team. They did some drilling and they concluded that.

107
00:05:49.241 --> 00:05:52.450
Well, they found absolutely nothing that there's nothing underneath it.

108
00:05:52.540 --> 00:05:55.150
And there's nothing to be seen here. So just to clarify,

109
00:05:55.270 --> 00:05:59.750
is he saying that ground penetrating was wrong? Like what you know, in,

110
00:05:59.751 --> 00:06:01.790
why aren't you letting anyone else see this for themselves?

111
00:06:01.791 --> 00:06:05.660
Why did you cap it off and prevent any other archeologists from checking it out,

112
00:06:05.810 --> 00:06:07.910
such as John Anthony and Robert shock.

113
00:06:08.120 --> 00:06:11.150
But then I saw something really interesting while watching one of Brian

114
00:06:11.810 --> 00:06:13.250
Forrester's videos about this topic.

115
00:06:13.790 --> 00:06:16.190
He points out an incredibly interesting fact,

116
00:06:16.191 --> 00:06:19.880
which is that the Sphinx itself is carved out of limestone bedrock and all

117
00:06:19.881 --> 00:06:24.020
around the Sphinx itself is limestone bedrock to the left of it,

118
00:06:24.021 --> 00:06:26.210
to the right of it. And in between the pause,

119
00:06:26.630 --> 00:06:31.460
except for one area in front of the pause that has these stone tiles.

120
00:06:31.461 --> 00:06:34.190
And you can see here that they have been starting to replace them.

121
00:06:34.191 --> 00:06:37.670
They're very old and they've been doing maintenance and, uh, restorations to it.

122
00:06:38.270 --> 00:06:42.590
But why would you have these stone tiles in front of the Sphinx?

123
00:06:42.620 --> 00:06:45.020
The only place around that has these bile away.

124
00:06:45.260 --> 00:06:48.620
And it just so happens to be located where ground-penetrating radar has

125
00:06:48.621 --> 00:06:51.080
identified a cavity, a chamber of some kind.

126
00:06:51.350 --> 00:06:52.910
And as you look at these other photos,

127
00:06:52.940 --> 00:06:56.060
they have since covered up the entire site, at least in front of it,

128
00:06:56.210 --> 00:06:57.140
with these stone tiles,

129
00:06:57.740 --> 00:07:01.370
what these boardwalks could these tiles be indicative of some sort of roofing

130
00:07:01.371 --> 00:07:05.720
system for the chamber below? You know, I want to point something else.

131
00:07:05.721 --> 00:07:08.150
That's really interesting. So if you go to Wikipedia,

132
00:07:08.151 --> 00:07:11.270
which of course I do not endorse for so many reasons,

133
00:07:11.810 --> 00:07:14.450
but if you go and look up the great Sphinx and Wikipedia,

134
00:07:14.540 --> 00:07:17.030
do a control F search for the words,

135
00:07:17.090 --> 00:07:21.290
shaft chamber tunnel underground under Spinks,

136
00:07:21.291 --> 00:07:26.000
anything under the Sphinx hall of records and not one single of these words

137
00:07:26.390 --> 00:07:29.270
pops up, not one of them. Now that's really interesting.

138
00:07:29.660 --> 00:07:32.840
But if you look up the hall of records, which has its own Wikipedia page,

139
00:07:32.990 --> 00:07:35.540
you'll find a link to the great Sphinx. And,

140
00:07:35.720 --> 00:07:38.840
and of course you'll find a link to pseudo archeology as well. Now,

141
00:07:38.841 --> 00:07:43.160
if you think that Wikipedia is unreliable because of the fact that anyone can

142
00:07:43.161 --> 00:07:45.410
edit it, well, that's actually no longer the case.

143
00:07:45.411 --> 00:07:47.270
And it hasn't been for several years now,

144
00:07:47.570 --> 00:07:50.960
Wikipedia has been bought and paid for and Cheryl Atkinson,

145
00:07:51.260 --> 00:07:54.350
who I highly recommend you check out her Ted, talk about this subject,

146
00:07:54.710 --> 00:07:57.470
outlines it in detail. And if you don't believe me on this,

147
00:07:57.500 --> 00:07:59.900
try and do the edit yourself and see what happens. Now,

148
00:07:59.901 --> 00:08:02.570
let me transition to something incredibly interesting.

149
00:08:03.110 --> 00:08:06.170
Dr. [inaudible] himself went on TV.

150
00:08:06.171 --> 00:08:10.670
He stated that he found a shaft 29 meters down 95 feet,

151
00:08:10.671 --> 00:08:15.080
approximately that's located directly between or exactly between the

152
00:08:15.081 --> 00:08:18.680
Sphinx and the second pyramid itself. Chef Ron also known as Kafra.

153
00:08:18.950 --> 00:08:22.580
He stated that there's a tomb down there and most likely to be the God,

154
00:08:22.581 --> 00:08:26.180
a Cyrus himself, the God of the underworld, the God of the afterlife.

155
00:08:26.510 --> 00:08:30.050
And in fact, he's famous for seeing this a judgment scene, as you see here,

156
00:08:30.051 --> 00:08:31.430
but you can find him everywhere else.

157
00:08:31.431 --> 00:08:34.310
These depictions are in the valley of the Kings and all over the place.

158
00:08:34.311 --> 00:08:36.590
And of course, it's interesting that he always has green skin.

159
00:08:36.591 --> 00:08:39.410
It makes you wonder what that's about. So I came across a video.

160
00:08:39.470 --> 00:08:42.530
Now this is from Fox and this was filmed. I believe in 1999,

161
00:08:42.560 --> 00:08:45.680
it could have been 96, but they take a crew down there.

162
00:08:45.710 --> 00:08:48.620
They take this lady and they actually go to the site.

163
00:08:48.621 --> 00:08:51.200
And here I'm showing you screenshots from this video.

164
00:08:51.470 --> 00:08:54.620
And I highly recommend you check out this video. The link is in the description.

165
00:08:54.621 --> 00:08:58.350
It's 13 minutes long and it is fascinating, but then we get through this.

166
00:08:58.351 --> 00:09:00.210
So as you can see here,

167
00:09:00.330 --> 00:09:04.890
it has multiple layers or levels and the stagger off and the deepest is 95 feet

168
00:09:04.891 --> 00:09:07.440
down. So they go down this chamber,

169
00:09:07.470 --> 00:09:12.180
this shaft carved through solid limestone bedrock in the first,

170
00:09:12.240 --> 00:09:14.010
or I should say the middle level.

171
00:09:14.190 --> 00:09:17.460
There is a set of tombs and there's a sarcophagus in there as well,

172
00:09:17.760 --> 00:09:19.260
even some bone fragments as well,

173
00:09:19.261 --> 00:09:23.370
but the place is apparently been looted or something. So as the keep going,

174
00:09:23.490 --> 00:09:26.070
and as you can see, here they go from the, by the way,

175
00:09:26.071 --> 00:09:28.230
this is 55 feet or 65 feet deep.

176
00:09:28.230 --> 00:09:31.410
It was hard to tell what she said in the video because of audio issues.

177
00:09:31.590 --> 00:09:34.650
But as they go to the next set of shafts, that goes from that 50,

178
00:09:34.651 --> 00:09:37.680
60 foot mark down to the approximately 100 feet down,

179
00:09:38.010 --> 00:09:39.870
look how impressive this thing is.

180
00:09:40.230 --> 00:09:43.920
So it dives down to the depths of the earth underneath the Giza plateau.

181
00:09:44.130 --> 00:09:44.610
And in it,

182
00:09:44.610 --> 00:09:49.050
there is this incredible burial site for massive pillars with hieroglyphs and

183
00:09:49.770 --> 00:09:52.320
petroglyphs, surrounded by a water moat. And by the way,

184
00:09:52.590 --> 00:09:55.980
this site was completely submerged in water. When they found it,

185
00:09:55.981 --> 00:09:57.750
they had to pump it out. It took a while.

186
00:09:58.110 --> 00:10:00.690
And as he shows her this massive sarcophagus,

187
00:10:01.080 --> 00:10:03.630
it's still about a foot down underwater.

188
00:10:03.840 --> 00:10:06.480
He thinks that it's probably a Cyrus where they weren't sure yet as they were

189
00:10:06.481 --> 00:10:09.000
still conducting the, uh, excavation.

190
00:10:09.630 --> 00:10:12.600
And this sarcophagus itself is nine feet long.

191
00:10:12.840 --> 00:10:16.770
The lid and the box individually are approximately 11 to 12 times,

192
00:10:16.771 --> 00:10:20.460
according to Zahi hos. And when the lady asks him,

193
00:10:20.461 --> 00:10:23.850
how did they bring this massive thing down here? He gives a theory.

194
00:10:24.000 --> 00:10:24.811
He'd said he doesn't know,

195
00:10:24.811 --> 00:10:28.680
but his theory is that the would've probably done a dug a second shaft.

196
00:10:28.681 --> 00:10:30.210
So first they dig the first shaft.

197
00:10:30.510 --> 00:10:35.490
They fill it with sand and then they dig a second shaft right next to it and

198
00:10:35.700 --> 00:10:40.500
start moving sand away. And it slowly lowers its self down by itself.

199
00:10:40.620 --> 00:10:43.660
If that makes sense, except for the fact that there's no evidence for this,

200
00:10:43.900 --> 00:10:46.470
this shaft, if this is indeed the case,

201
00:10:46.740 --> 00:10:50.040
you'd have to be able to find it within the perimeter of the chamber itself or

202
00:10:50.041 --> 00:10:51.600
immediately without outside the perimeter.

203
00:10:51.601 --> 00:10:55.560
But there's some issues with this theory besides the fact that archeologists

204
00:10:55.561 --> 00:10:59.580
never found it, which I mean, come on. That should be easy to find, but again,

205
00:10:59.610 --> 00:11:02.820
each level it staggers between the shafts.

206
00:11:03.120 --> 00:11:05.520
So how many shafts would the secondary shafts would?

207
00:11:05.610 --> 00:11:07.950
They have to have Doug and again, through limestone bedrock,

208
00:11:08.130 --> 00:11:10.710
that's not an easy task and look at the precision of this,

209
00:11:10.950 --> 00:11:14.910
but here's where it gets even more interesting. So [inaudible] takes her too,

210
00:11:14.911 --> 00:11:15.451
as you can see,

211
00:11:15.451 --> 00:11:19.530
there's these two tunnels that go extend outwards from this tomb,

212
00:11:19.531 --> 00:11:20.820
this burial site itself,

213
00:11:21.210 --> 00:11:24.930
one of which he claims has never been excavated and he doesn't know what's down

214
00:11:24.931 --> 00:11:28.110
there. This is his own words. By the way, you can watch this in the video. Well,

215
00:11:28.111 --> 00:11:30.120
first of all, I don't believe that you don't know what's down there.

216
00:11:30.121 --> 00:11:32.010
You didn't go take a peek, like give me a break,

217
00:11:32.130 --> 00:11:35.820
but why not at least point the camera down there with the flashlight for just a

218
00:11:35.821 --> 00:11:38.010
second? Why does he have to block it off like this?

219
00:11:38.820 --> 00:11:42.300
Which direction do these tunnel shafts, these, these tunnels go.

220
00:11:42.600 --> 00:11:44.520
That's an incredibly important question.

221
00:11:44.521 --> 00:11:49.290
Considering the fact that these legends of a hall of records being located under

222
00:11:49.291 --> 00:11:53.380
the Sphinx connects from an underground tunnel from the Sphinx to the pyramids

223
00:11:53.381 --> 00:11:56.800
themselves. You know, this is the same guy that is back in Egypt,

224
00:11:56.950 --> 00:11:59.500
despite being fired from the minister of antiquities of Egypt,

225
00:11:59.501 --> 00:12:03.520
for his corruption. Despite the fact that a few years after his firing,

226
00:12:03.550 --> 00:12:06.950
he was implicated in a massive theft of artifacts from a pyramid.

227
00:12:07.030 --> 00:12:08.410
And this is what he's implicated in.

228
00:12:08.411 --> 00:12:12.730
He gets off the hook and now he's chosen to be the guy leading the entire

229
00:12:12.731 --> 00:12:16.270
excavation for the three mysteriously discovered, uh,

230
00:12:16.300 --> 00:12:19.930
chambers within the great pyramid itself, as you may have seen in the news,

231
00:12:19.931 --> 00:12:23.620
and I've discussed this in multiple other videos, he is the guy leading that,

232
00:12:23.740 --> 00:12:25.030
that, uh, discovery,

233
00:12:25.780 --> 00:12:30.040
the same guy who changed his story multiple times about the very

234
00:12:30.041 --> 00:12:32.890
existence of chambers and tunnels.

235
00:12:33.070 --> 00:12:37.450
And the Sphinx itself has denied all that went back and forth only to say, well,

236
00:12:37.690 --> 00:12:40.660
there is some tunnels in some shafts, but they don't go anywhere.

237
00:12:40.661 --> 00:12:43.720
There's nothing to see. We have to start connecting the dots on this.

238
00:12:44.110 --> 00:12:47.860
There are shafts, there are tunnels. They don't show us any information. I mean,

239
00:12:47.861 --> 00:12:51.400
isn't it pretty odd that there's not a single photograph or video of anything

240
00:12:51.401 --> 00:12:54.910
down underneath. They show us only a little bit and then just stop there.

241
00:12:54.911 --> 00:12:59.710
Is that not suspicious or the fact that they clearly control Wikipedia?

242
00:12:59.920 --> 00:13:01.510
I mean these anonymous moderators, I mean,

243
00:13:01.511 --> 00:13:04.450
it's bought and paid for who do you think is doing it? Wherever is doing it.

244
00:13:04.630 --> 00:13:08.740
It's not an accident that they completely omit tunnels. Shafts,

245
00:13:08.770 --> 00:13:13.270
chambers hall of records, all from the Wikipedia page of the great Sphinx.

246
00:13:13.271 --> 00:13:15.970
And regardless of whether you never even look at Wikipedia,

247
00:13:15.971 --> 00:13:19.060
it is still the world's most utilized source of information.

248
00:13:19.300 --> 00:13:22.210
It's not an accident that shows up at the very top of any Google search.

249
00:13:22.630 --> 00:13:24.640
So that's important because this is deceiving.

250
00:13:24.760 --> 00:13:28.540
The citizens of the world they're omitting information. The cover-up is real.

251
00:13:28.810 --> 00:13:31.960
There's enough information to conclude that there's something there.

252
00:13:31.961 --> 00:13:34.480
We know this. So the question becomes,

253
00:13:34.660 --> 00:13:39.220
does that tunnel shaft that he showed us on TV on Fox decades

254
00:13:39.221 --> 00:13:43.270
ago? Does that lead to, or from the great Sphinx? I'll close up there.

255
00:13:43.330 --> 00:13:46.270
I'm Jimmy, this is bright insight like and subscribe and leave me a comment.

256
00:13:46.300 --> 00:13:47.440
Let me know what your thoughts are.

257
00:13:47.770 --> 00:13:51.160
Many more videos to come and a whole wide variety of topics. Take care,

258
00:13:51.161 --> 00:13:51.640
everybody.
