00:00:00.450 --> 00:00:02.310
<v 0>I'll play the video clip in just a moment,</v>

2
00:00:02.340 --> 00:00:07.170
but it's fair to say that Elon Musk is quickly becoming one of the most famous

3
00:00:07.171 --> 00:00:08.910
people on planet earth,

4
00:00:09.540 --> 00:00:12.540
born in South Africa and who is now a Canadian American.

5
00:00:12.810 --> 00:00:14.790
He has become a billionaire business,

6
00:00:14.791 --> 00:00:19.770
magnate CEO and co-founder of several companies, including the car company,

7
00:00:19.771 --> 00:00:23.220
Tesla, solar city, the boring company,

8
00:00:23.221 --> 00:00:27.990
SpaceX and others. However, most people are completely unaware of the name,

9
00:00:28.440 --> 00:00:31.320
Nikola Tesla. And I'll discuss details on that in just a moment.

10
00:00:31.440 --> 00:00:36.060
But Nikola Tesla is perhaps the most prolific inventor of all time with hundreds

11
00:00:36.061 --> 00:00:37.260
of patents around the world,

12
00:00:37.261 --> 00:00:42.240
including arguably 80% of the technology that we use every single day can be

13
00:00:42.241 --> 00:00:44.520
credited in some way to Nikola Tesla.

14
00:00:44.970 --> 00:00:48.480
And the Tesla car company is named after Nikola Tesla as he's the one that

15
00:00:48.481 --> 00:00:52.890
invented the AC induction motor, which is of course utilized in Tesla's cars.

16
00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:55.200
But what Elon Musk said about Nikola Tesla,

17
00:00:55.201 --> 00:00:57.180
when he was asked about him in an interview, well,

18
00:00:57.570 --> 00:01:00.960
you may find it a bit interesting. So before I play that clip,

19
00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:03.210
there's a few details that you need to know.

20
00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:07.860
Nicola Tesla created the technology to harness the AC or alternating current,

21
00:01:08.160 --> 00:01:11.310
which is used to connect and power the electrical grid throughout the modern

22
00:01:11.311 --> 00:01:15.330
world. We also use DC or direct current, for example,

23
00:01:15.331 --> 00:01:20.310
that is what's used to power my laptop as well as charging our cell phones in

24
00:01:20.311 --> 00:01:22.860
short alternating. Current can travel significantly,

25
00:01:22.861 --> 00:01:26.250
further distances than direct current. And essentially without it,

26
00:01:26.251 --> 00:01:28.920
we would need power plants and practically every city. I mean,

27
00:01:28.921 --> 00:01:33.150
imagine that literally thousands of more coal or nuclear power plants throughout

28
00:01:33.151 --> 00:01:33.984
the world.

29
00:01:34.050 --> 00:01:38.820
Now we have all heard of Thomas Edison and Edison hired Nikola Tesla to improve

30
00:01:38.821 --> 00:01:41.160
the DC technology, which is how,

31
00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:45.030
and when Tesla came to develop the technology to harness the alternating

32
00:01:45.031 --> 00:01:48.870
current, which is far superior for supplying electricity to a city,

33
00:01:49.230 --> 00:01:53.850
what you probably don't know is that Edison had promised Nikola Tesla $50,000,

34
00:01:53.851 --> 00:01:57.210
which by the way, is equivalent to a couple million dollars in today's value,

35
00:01:57.510 --> 00:02:01.920
but he refused to pay Tesla and an attempt to save face and increase profits by

36
00:02:01.921 --> 00:02:04.020
bolstering the use of the direct current.

37
00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:07.980
And he went on to start an aggressive marketing campaign to discredit Nikola

38
00:02:07.981 --> 00:02:08.550
Tesla,

39
00:02:08.550 --> 00:02:12.290
as well as the alternating current telling the masses that it was dangerous and

40
00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:15.150
it would burn down houses and entire cities, which by the way,

41
00:02:15.180 --> 00:02:20.070
Edison knew was a flat-out lie. Edison's marketing campaign included,

42
00:02:20.100 --> 00:02:22.620
electrocuting dogs, horses,

43
00:02:22.621 --> 00:02:27.450
and even an elephant in public in a disgusting attempt to deceive and scare the

44
00:02:27.451 --> 00:02:30.690
masses, hoping that they would want DC instead,

45
00:02:30.900 --> 00:02:32.250
but his attempt of course failed.

46
00:02:32.251 --> 00:02:36.540
And here we are 130 years later and we are utilizing the AC current throughout

47
00:02:36.541 --> 00:02:37.374
the modern world.

48
00:02:37.500 --> 00:02:41.280
And yet Thomas Edison became famous the world over as we were taught that he

49
00:02:41.281 --> 00:02:44.820
invented the light bulb, but we now know that that's not true at all.

50
00:02:44.821 --> 00:02:48.150
Thomas Edison did not invent the light bulb. Rather.

51
00:02:48.151 --> 00:02:52.020
He purchased the patent from Henry Woodward and Matthew Evans in 1880.

52
00:02:52.350 --> 00:02:56.070
And then he hired a team of 50 interns to perfect the patent,

53
00:02:56.280 --> 00:02:59.860
which he then stamped his name on and made a fortune incredible. Right.

54
00:02:59.861 --> 00:03:02.920
And it wasn't till just a few years ago that they started teaching otherwise in

55
00:03:02.921 --> 00:03:03.754
schools.

56
00:03:03.880 --> 00:03:06.970
But do you want to hear something that Thomas Edison did event that almost

57
00:03:06.971 --> 00:03:10.270
nobody knows the electric chair that's right.

58
00:03:10.660 --> 00:03:15.070
Thomas Edison made money off a device that he created that would be used to kill

59
00:03:15.071 --> 00:03:19.930
people. And guess what else? It uses the DC current. I said it before,

60
00:03:19.931 --> 00:03:22.900
and I'll say it again. Thomas Edison was a liar.

61
00:03:23.200 --> 00:03:26.650
He was a killer of innocent animals for profit and overall,

62
00:03:26.651 --> 00:03:28.840
he was a person of incredibly low character.

63
00:03:28.960 --> 00:03:32.110
Edison was not a brilliant inventor. He was a brilliant marketer.

64
00:03:32.111 --> 00:03:35.620
And that's how he was essentially able to fool most of the world for more than a

65
00:03:35.621 --> 00:03:39.070
hundred years into thinking that he had created the things that he will actually

66
00:03:39.310 --> 00:03:40.630
have it all that aside.

67
00:03:40.800 --> 00:03:43.540
Then he'd get back to Elon Musk and the video clip of the interview,

68
00:03:43.541 --> 00:03:46.900
where he was asked about Nikola Tesla and Thomas Edison.

69
00:03:47.200 --> 00:03:50.050
And it's about 51 seconds long. Here's the clip.

70
00:03:50.230 --> 00:03:53.230
And I'll have a few really interesting points to make about it right after.

71
00:03:54.010 --> 00:03:58.870
<v 1>As far as role models. Um, I think,</v>

72
00:03:58.871 --> 00:04:00.670
you know, there's obviously some of the obvious role models.

73
00:04:00.671 --> 00:04:02.740
I think Edison was certainly a role model. Um,

74
00:04:03.410 --> 00:04:08.140
probably one of the biggest role models. Um, yeah, I read books about him.

75
00:04:08.260 --> 00:04:11.180
Absolutely. Um, and, um,

76
00:04:11.400 --> 00:04:14.770
and it's interesting contrast like Edison versus Tesla because interesting,

77
00:04:14.771 --> 00:04:16.630
you know, the, the car companies called Tesla. Um,

78
00:04:16.900 --> 00:04:19.180
and the reason it's called Tesla is because we use an AC induction motor,

79
00:04:19.240 --> 00:04:21.430
which is an architecture that Tesla developed. Um,

80
00:04:21.431 --> 00:04:24.130
and the guy probably deserves a little more play than he gets in current

81
00:04:24.131 --> 00:04:28.660
society. Um, but on balance, I'm a bigger fan of Edison than Tesla,

82
00:04:29.530 --> 00:04:34.360
um, because Edison brought his stuff to market and made those inventions

83
00:04:34.690 --> 00:04:39.520
accessible to the world. Whereas Tesla did didn't really do that. Um,

84
00:04:40.540 --> 00:04:45.250
so, uh, that's certainly a big one. Um.

85
00:04:45.460 --> 00:04:47.260
<v 0>So I have a few concerns,</v>

86
00:04:47.261 --> 00:04:50.230
but let me first say that the more I learn about Elon Musk,

87
00:04:50.260 --> 00:04:51.430
the more I admire him,

88
00:04:51.460 --> 00:04:54.580
we need the world needs more people to follow his footsteps.

89
00:04:55.210 --> 00:04:57.850
But at the same time, the more I learn about Nikola Tesla,

90
00:04:57.851 --> 00:05:01.990
the more I admire him as well, keep in mind that this interview was from 2008,

91
00:05:02.020 --> 00:05:05.980
but it's literally the only example I could find where Elon Musk discusses

92
00:05:05.981 --> 00:05:09.940
Nikola Tesla. Does anyone else know of another example? If so,

93
00:05:09.941 --> 00:05:11.770
please leave a comment. In fact,

94
00:05:11.771 --> 00:05:15.490
I saw this interview on a YouTube video and reading through the comments.

95
00:05:15.970 --> 00:05:19.660
It was blatantly clear that a lot of people were very upset with the Elon Musk's

96
00:05:19.661 --> 00:05:20.381
responses.

97
00:05:20.381 --> 00:05:24.190
And it also is worth mentioning that Elon Musk has received a lot of criticism

98
00:05:24.191 --> 00:05:28.540
in the past for not having given Nicola credit or Nikola Tesla enough credit

99
00:05:28.810 --> 00:05:32.140
for Tesla's enormous success with his car company.

100
00:05:32.290 --> 00:05:35.290
So basically in response to various past criticism,

101
00:05:35.320 --> 00:05:39.580
Musk went ahead and donated $1 million to the Nikola Tesla museum in Belgrade.

102
00:05:39.970 --> 00:05:44.260
And I think that's absolutely fantastic, huge props to Elon Musk for doing that.

103
00:05:44.500 --> 00:05:45.011
But I,

104
00:05:45.011 --> 00:05:49.180
and others want to hear more from Elon Musk and more recently about his opinions

105
00:05:49.181 --> 00:05:51.970
of Nikola Tesla, as well as Thomas Edison. I mean,

106
00:05:51.971 --> 00:05:54.820
at first I was a bit taken back by some of his responses,

107
00:05:54.821 --> 00:05:57.070
but then I thought about it take the first part.

108
00:05:57.200 --> 00:05:59.390
He said that Edison was his role model.

109
00:05:59.391 --> 00:06:01.310
And he went on to say that he had read books on them.

110
00:06:01.820 --> 00:06:05.390
This just remind ourselves that Elon Musk is brilliant, but at the same time,

111
00:06:05.391 --> 00:06:07.880
he's not an inventor. He's not a rocket scientist.

112
00:06:08.480 --> 00:06:11.720
He is somebody who has found a way to improve humanity's future through the use

113
00:06:11.721 --> 00:06:15.350
of technology while making significant sums of money that can be used for his

114
00:06:15.351 --> 00:06:20.150
desires to explore and colonize space Musk wants to go to Mars and he has

115
00:06:20.151 --> 00:06:22.490
found a path to make that a possibility.

116
00:06:22.730 --> 00:06:26.060
So I understand where Elon Musk is coming from in regards to Edison,

117
00:06:26.090 --> 00:06:29.870
able to prop up his product and get it out there and market it with unbelievable

118
00:06:29.871 --> 00:06:33.560
success. And by the way, I too had read a book on Thomas Edison. In fact,

119
00:06:33.860 --> 00:06:36.590
I did a book report on him. I don't know, probably like the sixth grade.

120
00:06:37.100 --> 00:06:39.830
And that book mentioned absolutely nothing about a variety of things.

121
00:06:39.831 --> 00:06:40.640
First of all,

122
00:06:40.640 --> 00:06:43.970
it's flat out stated that Thomas Edison had invented the light bulb,

123
00:06:43.971 --> 00:06:44.804
which wasn't true.

124
00:06:45.290 --> 00:06:48.560
And it didn't mention a single thing about him discrediting Nikola Tesla or the

125
00:06:48.561 --> 00:06:52.580
alternating current. So is it possible that Elon Musk isn't aware of it either?

126
00:06:52.581 --> 00:06:56.690
I mean, make no mistake, most of the world has no idea about these details.

127
00:06:57.020 --> 00:07:01.430
And Elon Musk is spending his adult life pursuing or pursuing other interests

128
00:07:01.431 --> 00:07:02.360
and passions. So, I mean,

129
00:07:02.361 --> 00:07:05.240
this might be something that he had looked into decades ago and it hasn't

130
00:07:05.241 --> 00:07:06.980
revisited since it is possible.

131
00:07:07.070 --> 00:07:09.620
He doesn't know all the details as most people don't.

132
00:07:09.800 --> 00:07:12.050
And also it's only a 51 second clip.

133
00:07:12.051 --> 00:07:15.920
It's just not enough to know his true understanding of Edison or Tesla,

134
00:07:16.130 --> 00:07:19.760
but I am very curious to know what Elan's opinion is of Edison having

135
00:07:19.761 --> 00:07:20.870
electrocuted animals,

136
00:07:20.871 --> 00:07:25.580
as well as the lying and deceiving the public involving Tesla and discrediting

137
00:07:25.581 --> 00:07:28.940
him and just flat out lying to try and bolster his product.

138
00:07:28.941 --> 00:07:32.810
I'd like to know his thoughts on that and not to mention electrocuting dogs and

139
00:07:32.811 --> 00:07:36.560
horses and elephants. Are you joking? That's only sick.

140
00:07:36.561 --> 00:07:39.110
People would do something that total sociopath. I mean,

141
00:07:39.111 --> 00:07:42.260
what does that tell you about somebody? So in the next part of the interview,

142
00:07:42.710 --> 00:07:45.710
Elon and acknowledges that Tesla deserves more play than he gets in current

143
00:07:45.711 --> 00:07:46.251
society.

144
00:07:46.251 --> 00:07:49.610
And this goes back to what I said at the beginning of this video about how most

145
00:07:49.611 --> 00:07:52.880
people are completely unaware of who Nikola Tesla is.

146
00:07:52.970 --> 00:07:55.670
He's literally not taught in the American public school system.

147
00:07:55.730 --> 00:07:58.190
He's not required learning by the department of education.

148
00:07:58.191 --> 00:08:02.420
And of course not included in the common core subjects and this to go to a

149
00:08:02.421 --> 00:08:06.020
private school or have a great teacher who chooses to step outside the

150
00:08:06.021 --> 00:08:09.770
curriculum is just simply not required testing. And hence,

151
00:08:09.771 --> 00:08:12.980
why so many people in the United States have no idea who they are, who he is.

152
00:08:12.981 --> 00:08:15.200
In fact, it's because of the car company, Tesla,

153
00:08:15.201 --> 00:08:18.080
that people are starting to figure them out because they'll Google Tesla,

154
00:08:18.081 --> 00:08:20.570
the car company to figure out what the name means. And they're like,

155
00:08:20.600 --> 00:08:22.520
oh my goodness, there's someone named Nikola Tesla.

156
00:08:22.760 --> 00:08:25.640
But it has to be mentioned that elsewhere in the world, this isn't the case.

157
00:08:25.641 --> 00:08:27.770
Like for example, in Europe, particularly Eastern Europe,

158
00:08:27.771 --> 00:08:32.450
I know for sure they teach Nikola Tesla in depth. So keep that in mind.

159
00:08:32.630 --> 00:08:36.800
So the question becomes for that I have for Elon Musk is why do you think the

160
00:08:37.190 --> 00:08:40.760
Nikola Tesla doesn't get that much attention and current society? I mean,

161
00:08:40.761 --> 00:08:43.940
why is that? Why is it that he's not being taught in school?

162
00:08:44.300 --> 00:08:46.220
So going back to the Elon Musk interview,

163
00:08:46.221 --> 00:08:49.640
when he mentioned that Edison had brought his product to the market where Tesla

164
00:08:49.641 --> 00:08:54.290
didn't really do that, now that's true. Tesla was not a successful marketer,

165
00:08:54.500 --> 00:08:58.200
whereas Edison was, but Nikola Tesla was taken advantage of,

166
00:08:58.201 --> 00:09:01.740
and he died poor at the age of 86 because of greedy people,

167
00:09:01.741 --> 00:09:04.440
such as Thomas Edison, that took advantage of them. I mean,

168
00:09:04.441 --> 00:09:06.990
we're talking about the guy that invented the electric motor. I mean,

169
00:09:06.991 --> 00:09:10.350
just stop and think about how many things in your life that you use an electric

170
00:09:10.351 --> 00:09:13.830
motor for. And we never really stopped to think twice about it. I mean,

171
00:09:13.831 --> 00:09:17.730
this is the same guy that also invented the remote control. Think about that.

172
00:09:17.760 --> 00:09:22.500
And even the radio and his inventions and his works had contributed greatly to

173
00:09:22.501 --> 00:09:27.120
the inventions of robotics, lasers, x-rays computers and many other things.

174
00:09:27.180 --> 00:09:29.910
And yet again, most people have no idea who he is,

175
00:09:30.030 --> 00:09:33.720
do a sidewalk poll in any city in America and start asking people about Nikola

176
00:09:33.721 --> 00:09:36.780
Tesla and the leaders say they have no idea who he is or they'll be like, oh,

177
00:09:36.781 --> 00:09:39.840
wait, you mean the car company. Now, all this said,

178
00:09:39.900 --> 00:09:42.570
this is not criticism towards Elon Musk. Not at all.

179
00:09:42.571 --> 00:09:46.980
I admire Elon Musk and he is absolutely a role model. So as Nikola Tesla,

180
00:09:46.981 --> 00:09:50.100
he's a role model, but in my opinion, and many others,

181
00:09:50.550 --> 00:09:52.710
Thomas Edison is not a role model at all.

182
00:09:52.770 --> 00:09:55.560
But most people have a deep affection for Elon Musk.

183
00:09:55.561 --> 00:09:58.410
And I have watched many videos on him. And I can tell you that he is,

184
00:09:58.470 --> 00:10:00.000
he's definitely one of the good guys,

185
00:10:00.420 --> 00:10:03.390
but some people don't trust them because of course, space X.

186
00:10:03.391 --> 00:10:06.990
They have an affiliation and Abbott huge contract with NASA and well,

187
00:10:07.320 --> 00:10:10.770
some people just don't trust NASA. So they don't trust Elon Musk,

188
00:10:11.400 --> 00:10:12.780
but it's worth mentioning that. I mean,

189
00:10:12.781 --> 00:10:16.530
these people need to look into the people that opposed Elon Musk and space X.

190
00:10:16.531 --> 00:10:16.740
I mean,

191
00:10:16.740 --> 00:10:21.690
even Neil Armstrong testified in Congress to try and stop

192
00:10:21.870 --> 00:10:25.020
commercial private companies from space exploration. I mean,

193
00:10:25.230 --> 00:10:30.090
just think about that and look into all the people that oppose Elon Musk because

194
00:10:30.091 --> 00:10:32.820
of him, he's doing what NASA has failed to do for decades.

195
00:10:32.821 --> 00:10:35.910
We've never gone back to the moon. We haven't stepped foot on Mars.

196
00:10:36.090 --> 00:10:39.240
And Elon Musk is essentially become this beacon of light for humanity because

197
00:10:39.241 --> 00:10:40.470
he's doing these things.

198
00:10:40.620 --> 00:10:43.440
I highly recommend that you research Elon Musk on your own,

199
00:10:43.441 --> 00:10:45.300
especially his upbringing. If you look at the fact,

200
00:10:45.540 --> 00:10:47.130
him being bullied in South Africa,

201
00:10:47.131 --> 00:10:50.730
so severely that some kids threw him down a flight of stairs and send them to

202
00:10:50.731 --> 00:10:51.564
the hospital.

203
00:10:51.600 --> 00:10:54.960
Ultimately he overcame things that seem to hold most people down with

204
00:10:54.961 --> 00:10:57.990
insecurities and lack of confidence for their entire lives.

205
00:10:58.380 --> 00:11:00.840
And he has found a way to press forward. And in fact,

206
00:11:00.841 --> 00:11:02.820
this reminds me of an outstanding quote,

207
00:11:02.821 --> 00:11:06.840
which is the wealthiest place on the planet is the graveyard.

208
00:11:06.960 --> 00:11:10.980
Because in the graveyard we will find inventions that we were never exposed to

209
00:11:11.370 --> 00:11:12.203
ideas,

210
00:11:12.420 --> 00:11:16.740
dreams that never became a reality hopes and aspirations that were never acted

211
00:11:16.741 --> 00:11:20.250
upon. So when you look at Elon Musk, he's an unbelievably humble person.

212
00:11:20.280 --> 00:11:23.220
He denies that he's a genius, which so many people suggest that he is.

213
00:11:23.700 --> 00:11:26.760
And he has found a way to create opportunities for himself,

214
00:11:27.210 --> 00:11:29.250
which so many people said he could not do.

215
00:11:29.280 --> 00:11:31.500
He said he was going to fail at all of these things, whether it's Tesla,

216
00:11:31.501 --> 00:11:35.340
the car company, space X and everything else. And here he is,

217
00:11:35.341 --> 00:11:38.040
and this is just the beginning guys, but more than anything,

218
00:11:38.070 --> 00:11:41.520
I would like to know more from Elon Musk on the subject of intuition,

219
00:11:41.521 --> 00:11:44.760
which is by the way, something that Nikola Tesla had described in detail.

220
00:11:44.761 --> 00:11:47.310
And so did Einstein, that's asking Elon Musk,

221
00:11:47.340 --> 00:11:50.070
what's his opinion is on intuition and gut instinct.

222
00:11:50.071 --> 00:11:54.460
And how has that helped him in his own life and his own career success? I mean,

223
00:11:54.461 --> 00:11:55.151
make no mistakes.

224
00:11:55.151 --> 00:11:58.390
Some of the most successful people on earth have discussed intuition in detail,

225
00:11:58.391 --> 00:12:01.480
and that's just something they don't teach about in school. Anyways, guys,

226
00:12:01.481 --> 00:12:03.340
I'll leave it at that, but leave me a comment.

227
00:12:03.370 --> 00:12:07.720
