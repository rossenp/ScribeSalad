00:00:01.110 --> 00:00:06.000
<v 0>Ancient human civilization is far older and was far more advanced than we were</v>

2
00:00:06.001 --> 00:00:09.560
ever taught in school. And the evidence is overwhelmingly conclusive.

3
00:00:09.870 --> 00:00:12.280
That civilization was essentially reset,

4
00:00:12.590 --> 00:00:14.920
following a massive global cataly,

5
00:00:15.420 --> 00:00:20.120
likely a common or an asteroid impact to the north American ice shelf nearly 13

6
00:00:20.750 --> 00:00:24.070
and years ago. Not only does evidence conclude this,

7
00:00:24.071 --> 00:00:26.150
which I'll include later in this presentation,

8
00:00:26.450 --> 00:00:31.230
but recent analysis taken at go Beckley Tepe in Turkey shows that they carved in

9
00:00:31.280 --> 00:00:34.990
stone depictions of a comment impact to planet earth.

10
00:00:35.260 --> 00:00:37.830
That essentially was a reset for human civilization,

11
00:00:38.120 --> 00:00:42.380
which validates the works from people such as Graham, Randall, Carlson,

12
00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:45.700
and others. Now, if you're not familiar with go Beckley Tepe,

13
00:00:45.850 --> 00:00:49.740
it's located in Turkey and it is the world's oldest and largest megalithic

14
00:00:49.900 --> 00:00:53.940
structure. In fact, it's more than 6,000 years older than Stonehenge,

15
00:00:54.080 --> 00:00:57.820
and more than 50 times bigger as verified by ground penetrating radar,

16
00:00:58.360 --> 00:01:03.250
it has more than 220 to 50 to pillars that have a cosmic

17
00:01:03.360 --> 00:01:06.290
orientation. And in fact, it is the world's first,

18
00:01:06.400 --> 00:01:08.970
perfectly aligned north south facing structure.

19
00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:12.970
But what makes it even more incredible is that it's facing perfectly north and

20
00:01:12.971 --> 00:01:16.090
south even taking into consideration magnetic declination,

21
00:01:16.180 --> 00:01:18.050
which it makes it more accurate than a compass.

22
00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:22.520
This site has been dated to be 11,600 year result.

23
00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:27.160
So the question becomes how on earth were humans based on what we were taught on

24
00:01:27.161 --> 00:01:31.160
the textbooks, able to have this type of astronomical knowledge. Now,

25
00:01:31.161 --> 00:01:35.880
besides the fact that somehow unexplainably ancient humans were able to cut and

26
00:01:35.881 --> 00:01:36.960
carve these stone pillars,

27
00:01:37.430 --> 00:01:41.000
lift them as well as carve out three dimensional animals with incredible

28
00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:42.440
precision and keep 'em.

29
00:01:42.740 --> 00:01:46.870
This site had been buried up until the mid nineties when it was discovered it

30
00:01:46.871 --> 00:01:49.390
had been buried for more than 11,600 years,

31
00:01:49.930 --> 00:01:53.230
but it was just recently announced by researchers from the university of

32
00:01:53.390 --> 00:01:55.590
Edinborough that these depictions,

33
00:01:55.591 --> 00:01:59.990
these animals located throughout these stone pillars have a cosmic and

34
00:01:59.991 --> 00:02:02.590
constellation orientation and symbolism to them.

35
00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:05.380
And when they've combined computer software,

36
00:02:05.730 --> 00:02:10.340
that takes into account where the star constellations were 12,900 years ago,

37
00:02:10.350 --> 00:02:14.300
which is the same period of time where evidence shows that there was massive

38
00:02:14.370 --> 00:02:17.900
changes or a cataly here on earth, which I'll get to in just one more second,

39
00:02:18.330 --> 00:02:22.500
they were trying to depict a comment or fragments of a comment impact here on

40
00:02:22.740 --> 00:02:23.500
earth.

41
00:02:23.500 --> 00:02:27.490
No I've discussed the topic of the global cataly and other videos such as the

42
00:02:27.491 --> 00:02:30.650
network of 200 underground cities also located in Turkey.

43
00:02:30.960 --> 00:02:32.730
Some of which are 11 stories, deep,

44
00:02:32.800 --> 00:02:37.730
more than 200 feet underground had advanced air shafts as well as a network of

45
00:02:37.731 --> 00:02:38.171
tunnels.

46
00:02:38.171 --> 00:02:42.050
Some of which were three stories underground and spanned five miles through

47
00:02:42.290 --> 00:02:44.640
volcanic rock to other nearby under ground cities.

48
00:02:44.900 --> 00:02:48.720
And these cities were capable of holding tens of thousands of people in

49
00:02:48.721 --> 00:02:50.440
livestock. Individually.

50
00:02:51.010 --> 00:02:54.520
These underground cities are absolutely massive and they're a total mystery as

51
00:02:54.521 --> 00:02:57.000
nobody knows who built them. Now keep that in mind.

52
00:02:57.020 --> 00:03:01.200
As I share with you information from another video I made that discussed in

53
00:03:01.201 --> 00:03:01.660
detail,

54
00:03:01.660 --> 00:03:05.840
the overwhelming evidence of a cosmic collision to the north American ice shelf

55
00:03:05.910 --> 00:03:08.680
that happened approximately 12,900 years ago,

56
00:03:08.890 --> 00:03:12.480
which would justify the depictions taken at go Beckley Tepe,

57
00:03:12.690 --> 00:03:17.280
which essentially ancient humans were trying to show and share a story or

58
00:03:17.920 --> 00:03:21.710
perhaps worn a others of what had happened before. And as we know,

59
00:03:21.711 --> 00:03:24.430
everything in this universe appears to be cyclic.

60
00:03:24.770 --> 00:03:28.390
And if you take into the works of Randall Carlson, he outlines in detail.

61
00:03:28.850 --> 00:03:31.910
The overwhelming evidence that shows that throughout time,

62
00:03:32.260 --> 00:03:34.870
over the last 150 to 160,000 years,

63
00:03:34.871 --> 00:03:37.870
since modern humans have existed on planet earth,

64
00:03:37.960 --> 00:03:42.820
there have been anywhere between nine possibly a dozen global Lys that

65
00:03:42.821 --> 00:03:46.580
would have completely decimated a human civilization at that time,

66
00:03:46.950 --> 00:03:51.660
which would explain the fact on how modern humans only date back roughly 5,000

67
00:03:51.661 --> 00:03:54.580
years to ancient, uh, Sumerians E Mesopotamia,

68
00:03:54.750 --> 00:03:59.460
which would explain the incredible gap between then and now and how a set

69
00:03:59.940 --> 00:04:02.490
there are cycles of catastrophe here on earth.

70
00:04:02.750 --> 00:04:04.970
So what's this evidence of the cosmic collision? Well,

71
00:04:04.971 --> 00:04:07.290
there's a few things that happen all at the same period of time,

72
00:04:07.291 --> 00:04:08.810
12,900 years ago,

73
00:04:09.270 --> 00:04:13.370
the rapid and unexplainable end to the last ice age that caused a more than 400

74
00:04:13.400 --> 00:04:17.730
foot rise in global sea levels in a matter of years and possibly as much as 30

75
00:04:17.731 --> 00:04:19.810
feet overnight. And this has been confirmed,

76
00:04:20.040 --> 00:04:23.760
recent core ice sample data taken from Greenland and Antarctica.

77
00:04:24.350 --> 00:04:28.880
There's also a black matte layer called the younger dries boundary that covers

78
00:04:28.881 --> 00:04:31.400
more than 50 million square kilometers of the Earth's surface,

79
00:04:32.180 --> 00:04:36.120
at least three continents and contains elements such as melt glass,

80
00:04:36.750 --> 00:04:40.040
nano diamonds, Iridium, and extraterrestrial helium,

81
00:04:40.260 --> 00:04:44.630
all evidence of a cosmic collision. The same elements found in the KT boundary,

82
00:04:44.880 --> 00:04:49.550
which has agreed upon in science to have been evidence of the asteroid or combat

83
00:04:49.610 --> 00:04:51.550
impact that wiped out the dinosaurs.

84
00:04:51.970 --> 00:04:56.270
And there was also a massive extinction level event of more than 75% of all

85
00:04:56.380 --> 00:05:00.870
mammals in north America, including 120 species of megafauna.

86
00:05:01.420 --> 00:05:03.500
Amal is larger than a hundred pounds, which by the way,

87
00:05:03.501 --> 00:05:07.180
is about approximately as many mammals of that size that exists throughout the

88
00:05:07.181 --> 00:05:10.980
entire planet of earth today. And they all went extinct at the same time.

89
00:05:11.440 --> 00:05:14.180
And they're finding evidence such as in Willie Mamo,

90
00:05:14.410 --> 00:05:17.060
mass mortality sites of more than a thousand Willie Mamo.

91
00:05:17.690 --> 00:05:20.860
Many of them still have food in their mouths and broken legs as,

92
00:05:20.880 --> 00:05:24.890
as if they had a and blasted over, which completely contradicts into bunks,

93
00:05:24.891 --> 00:05:26.530
the mainstream narrative of, okay, well,

94
00:05:26.840 --> 00:05:29.650
hunters and gatherers had made the Willie mamos go extinct.

95
00:05:30.230 --> 00:05:32.010
Now you might be wondering why is this important?

96
00:05:32.520 --> 00:05:35.890
Keep in mind that everything in the universe that we're aware of happens in

97
00:05:35.891 --> 00:05:39.090
cycles. So whatever happened before will absolutely happen again.

98
00:05:39.230 --> 00:05:42.360
And there's a lot of evidence out there that suggests that we're long over do

99
00:05:42.780 --> 00:05:47.040
for a magnetic pole shift for maybe a rock from outer space, hitting us.

100
00:05:47.410 --> 00:05:49.840
There could be all kinds of number of different things that could happen here on

101
00:05:49.841 --> 00:05:53.000
planet earth. And it's important to set humanity up for success.

102
00:05:53.001 --> 00:05:54.360
So if there is another cataly,

103
00:05:54.570 --> 00:05:57.720
we're not starting back over from the stone age anyways, guys,

104
00:05:57.820 --> 00:06:00.840
I'm gonna leave it at that. I'm Jimmy, this is bright insight like,

105
00:06:00.960 --> 00:06:03.430
and subscribe, leave me a comment. Let what your thoughts are.

106
00:06:03.530 --> 00:06:06.510
And I have many other videos to come and a whole wide variety of topics.

107
00:06:06.900 --> 00:06:07.750
Take care, everybody.
