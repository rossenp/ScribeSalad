00:00:00.660 --> 00:00:04.920
<v 0>We are witnessing a new global epidemic where now more than ever,</v>

2
00:00:05.340 --> 00:00:07.680
people are feeling disenfranchised in their lives.

3
00:00:07.681 --> 00:00:11.760
They're feeling a lack of contentment feeling that they're not living their true

4
00:00:11.761 --> 00:00:13.320
life purpose. And in this video,

5
00:00:13.420 --> 00:00:16.320
I'm gonna share with you on how to identify what your life purpose is.

6
00:00:16.380 --> 00:00:20.750
But first let's discuss the obvious the world's getting crazy year.

7
00:00:20.810 --> 00:00:24.670
People are working themselves to the bone and they're asking themselves, well,

8
00:00:24.850 --> 00:00:25.391
is light.

9
00:00:25.391 --> 00:00:28.590
Is there more to life than just working five days a week for the weekend?

10
00:00:28.610 --> 00:00:32.710
And of course for the paycheck, I mean, we're seeing how the surveys are done,

11
00:00:32.711 --> 00:00:34.590
where it's not just millennials, by the way,

12
00:00:34.591 --> 00:00:38.270
where job dissatisfaction and disengagement is soaring,

13
00:00:38.400 --> 00:00:42.140
where you have nearly three outta four people Essent that just don't like what

14
00:00:42.141 --> 00:00:42.974
they do for a living.

15
00:00:43.600 --> 00:00:47.100
Or if you look at the fact that depression rates have skyrocketed over the last

16
00:00:47.101 --> 00:00:48.820
decade, but nowhere,

17
00:00:49.080 --> 00:00:52.740
is it more apparent when you look at the fact that people are dying with

18
00:00:52.850 --> 00:00:55.340
regrets, they're not living their lives. And like I said,

19
00:00:55.341 --> 00:01:00.100
this is a true epidemic. There have been surveys conducted at various hospitals.

20
00:01:00.200 --> 00:01:03.770
And hospice cares. People are asked, who are on their deathbed.

21
00:01:03.771 --> 00:01:05.290
They know that they're on their way out.

22
00:01:05.910 --> 00:01:08.570
And they're asked if they could go back in their lives and do something

23
00:01:08.571 --> 00:01:10.450
different. What, what do they wish they could do different?

24
00:01:10.990 --> 00:01:14.130
And what's amazing is that there were five answers that were so common.

25
00:01:14.750 --> 00:01:19.130
Let me just show you answer. Number one, which was the most common, which is,

26
00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:22.400
I wish I had the courage to live a life true to my self.

27
00:01:23.020 --> 00:01:26.760
Not the life others expected of me. I'm gonna discuss that,

28
00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:29.160
cuz that's incredibly important. But then to get through the others,

29
00:01:29.380 --> 00:01:33.640
the other four first number two, I wish I hadn't worked so hard.

30
00:01:34.060 --> 00:01:38.880
Number three, I wish I had the courage to express my feelings. Four.

31
00:01:39.080 --> 00:01:42.080
I wish I had stayed in touch with my friends and five.

32
00:01:42.160 --> 00:01:45.430
I wish I had let myself be happier now real quick, three,

33
00:01:45.440 --> 00:01:49.390
maybe four of these you could argue are straight up work or career related.

34
00:01:49.550 --> 00:01:52.510
I mean, come on. I wish I had stayed in touch with friends. Let's be honest.

35
00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:56.430
You don't see your friends as much because you work so much. Right? Number five.

36
00:01:56.470 --> 00:01:58.830
I wish I let myself be happier. Uh, well, okay.

37
00:01:58.890 --> 00:02:02.070
So you spent most of your life working for a job that you didn't love right

38
00:02:02.440 --> 00:02:06.300
there. You, so let me get back to number one real quick.

39
00:02:06.900 --> 00:02:10.900
I wish I had the courage to live a life true to myself and not the life others

40
00:02:11.300 --> 00:02:12.061
expected in me. I mean,

41
00:02:12.061 --> 00:02:16.180
how many people choose a career path because of their parents pushed them into

42
00:02:16.181 --> 00:02:20.020
it or maybe they went to school thinking that was the way to go or society as a

43
00:02:20.021 --> 00:02:22.660
whole. We don't, we don't think for ourselves. I mean,

44
00:02:22.661 --> 00:02:25.450
I love this quote by Ralph Waldo Emerson,

45
00:02:26.110 --> 00:02:29.850
to be yourself in a world that is constantly trying to make you something else

46
00:02:30.230 --> 00:02:33.210
is the greatest accomplishment and how true this is.

47
00:02:33.960 --> 00:02:37.570
It's always the people that are trying to fit in and just coast through society

48
00:02:37.950 --> 00:02:41.610
and check off the boxes, right? But where's that getting us again?

49
00:02:41.611 --> 00:02:43.850
People are dying with regrets and,

50
00:02:44.320 --> 00:02:48.240
and what now more than ever are living this with this lack of purpose in their

51
00:02:48.241 --> 00:02:52.640
life. What we have to start asking ourselves is who do we want to be? Not what,

52
00:02:53.220 --> 00:02:55.280
but who, because we have free,

53
00:02:55.281 --> 00:02:59.320
will we have choices and today can be the choice that you make to decide to

54
00:02:59.321 --> 00:03:01.880
decide that you know what, I'm not happy in my life.

55
00:03:01.930 --> 00:03:05.560
There are other things that I dream about doing and I just don't do. And why,

56
00:03:05.620 --> 00:03:09.640
why don't you do it well for a bunch of reasons you can't because of, uh,

57
00:03:09.641 --> 00:03:13.040
you can't sacrifice the pay or you're just not in a position to be able to do it

58
00:03:13.041 --> 00:03:15.280
right now. And you put things off and it never gets done.

59
00:03:15.700 --> 00:03:16.441
And before you know it,

60
00:03:16.441 --> 00:03:19.870
you're one of these people on their death beds dying with your own regrets.

61
00:03:20.490 --> 00:03:22.390
You have to realize that any dream that you have,

62
00:03:22.391 --> 00:03:25.750
that you want is absolutely possible. And it's you,

63
00:03:25.890 --> 00:03:29.230
that's creating the obstacles because of your preconceived notions and life

64
00:03:29.231 --> 00:03:30.630
experience. You think that, you know what,

65
00:03:30.820 --> 00:03:32.910
because something's not in front of you. That's so obvious.

66
00:03:33.100 --> 00:03:34.510
It's not apparent on how to do it,

67
00:03:34.700 --> 00:03:38.350
that you assume that it's not possible when it is. You have to get creative.

68
00:03:38.730 --> 00:03:42.620
But ultimately it's our fears that get the best of us that prevent us from doing

69
00:03:42.621 --> 00:03:44.940
this. There's a quote by Les brown,

70
00:03:44.941 --> 00:03:49.500
which is too many of us are not living our dreams because we are living our

71
00:03:49.630 --> 00:03:51.500
fears. I mean, think about this.

72
00:03:52.050 --> 00:03:54.820
It's self-doubt that we gets in our mind that we can't do this because we're

73
00:03:54.821 --> 00:03:57.140
either worried what others will think, or we're worried about failure.

74
00:03:57.870 --> 00:04:01.810
Self-doubt kills more dreams than any failure ever will. In fact,

75
00:04:01.811 --> 00:04:04.370
then you get into another quote real quick by Les brown,

76
00:04:04.371 --> 00:04:08.490
which is the wealthiest place on the planet is the graveyard.

77
00:04:08.491 --> 00:04:13.210
Because in the graveyard we find inventions that we were never exposed to ideas.

78
00:04:13.430 --> 00:04:18.250
Dreams never became a reality hopes and aspirations that were never acted

79
00:04:18.251 --> 00:04:21.520
upon. Think about that. How people including yourself,

80
00:04:22.070 --> 00:04:24.600
wish that they could do something different. And we just don't do it.

81
00:04:24.601 --> 00:04:28.400
Imagine how much this world has been robbed of whether it's the cure for cancer

82
00:04:28.580 --> 00:04:33.200
or whatever it is because people decided to take the easy path they had

83
00:04:33.201 --> 00:04:34.880
self-doubt they had fear. In fact,

84
00:04:34.881 --> 00:04:37.120
this reminds me of a quote by Aristo Sharon a second,

85
00:04:37.121 --> 00:04:39.720
which is that a lot of people are afraid of criticism.

86
00:04:40.360 --> 00:04:41.710
They afraid what other people are gonna think.

87
00:04:41.711 --> 00:04:44.030
If they decided to just go their own way, because that's not Frank,

88
00:04:44.390 --> 00:04:47.750
get the answer. The number one answer to people's greatest regret,

89
00:04:47.751 --> 00:04:50.750
which is that they wish that they had lived a life for themselves and not what

90
00:04:50.751 --> 00:04:53.550
other people have wanted out of them. They didn't think for themselves,

91
00:04:53.740 --> 00:04:57.430
they were too afraid of not fitting in. Well, like Aristotle said,

92
00:04:57.431 --> 00:05:01.420
there is only one way to avoid criticism. Do nothing,

93
00:05:02.080 --> 00:05:03.940
say nothing and be nothing.

94
00:05:04.520 --> 00:05:07.420
And a big part of what it comes down to is having self trust,

95
00:05:07.920 --> 00:05:10.100
to trust your instincts, to trust your intuition.

96
00:05:10.760 --> 00:05:14.100
You have to listen to yourself and know what it is that you want because

97
00:05:14.330 --> 00:05:17.420
otherwise how's the world gonna treat you. We're seeing this again,

98
00:05:17.421 --> 00:05:18.260
it's an epidemic.

99
00:05:18.680 --> 00:05:22.250
And now is the time for people to start making real change changes in their

100
00:05:22.251 --> 00:05:25.010
life. Today is the day that you decide, you know what?

101
00:05:25.590 --> 00:05:29.210
I'm not completely content in my life. There are things that I really wanna do.

102
00:05:29.530 --> 00:05:33.170
I have dreams and I'm not gonna be that guy on my deathbed or that girl or

103
00:05:33.171 --> 00:05:37.210
whoever that has these regrets. So this is the part where people are wondering,

104
00:05:37.211 --> 00:05:38.890
well, wait a second. What does this mean though?

105
00:05:39.310 --> 00:05:41.690
How do I turn this into making money and surviving?

106
00:05:41.691 --> 00:05:45.840
Because it's so easy to say when you're not the one that has bills and how am I

107
00:05:45.841 --> 00:05:47.800
gonna support my family and do all this.

108
00:05:47.830 --> 00:05:50.680
It's too late for me to make these changes. Uh, no, it's not.

109
00:05:50.750 --> 00:05:51.760
It's never too late.

110
00:05:52.060 --> 00:05:56.320
The obstacles are blinding you that you're not seeing the other possibilities

111
00:05:56.321 --> 00:05:58.640
that can get you there. It's the same thing that's worked out in my life.

112
00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:01.760
I went back to school because I thought I wanted to be Mr. Corporate America

113
00:06:01.870 --> 00:06:05.280
make a bunch of money sitting behind a desk until I realized that was gonna

114
00:06:05.281 --> 00:06:07.120
bring me nothing but suffering. And it was,

115
00:06:07.560 --> 00:06:10.240
I was living a miserable life and I couldn't figure out why.

116
00:06:10.820 --> 00:06:12.000
And the reason is is that I,

117
00:06:12.360 --> 00:06:15.640
I felt like I didn't make any decisions in my life to where I was that were

118
00:06:15.641 --> 00:06:18.590
thought of on my own. I listened to what other people thought I should do.

119
00:06:18.591 --> 00:06:21.510
And I didn't think for myself, but like I said earlier in the video,

120
00:06:22.090 --> 00:06:25.590
how do you find your life purpose? Well, there's a series of questions,

121
00:06:25.620 --> 00:06:28.390
four questions. In fact, look at this ven diagram,

122
00:06:30.060 --> 00:06:33.950
what do you love doing? What do you good at? What does the world need?

123
00:06:34.250 --> 00:06:39.100
And what can you be paid for those or questions or what you have to explore on

124
00:06:39.101 --> 00:06:42.300
your own just as I did. And this has worked incredibly effective for me,

125
00:06:42.420 --> 00:06:43.740
although it didn't work in one day either,

126
00:06:44.400 --> 00:06:47.260
but you have to look at various things like what is it that you truly love?

127
00:06:47.261 --> 00:06:48.620
What are you passionate about?

128
00:06:49.120 --> 00:06:53.020
Ask yourself the times in your life that you were most proud of yourself.

129
00:06:53.530 --> 00:06:54.250
What was that?

130
00:06:54.250 --> 00:06:59.010
What were you doing or also times in your life that you were the most

131
00:06:59.060 --> 00:07:02.370
happy? What did that look like? What was your life at that time?

132
00:07:02.640 --> 00:07:03.530
What were you doing?

133
00:07:03.910 --> 00:07:07.290
You just have to get creative and think outside the box on how you can make that

134
00:07:07.291 --> 00:07:09.810
your own. In fact, that reminds me of another quote.

135
00:07:09.830 --> 00:07:11.410
And this is by Joseph Campbell, for sure.

136
00:07:11.411 --> 00:07:14.690
Which is you are the hero of your own story.

137
00:07:15.110 --> 00:07:18.920
You need to map out your life as if you're watching a movie that you would love

138
00:07:19.020 --> 00:07:23.840
an entertaining movie, whatever that may be your storyline and you have free,

139
00:07:24.190 --> 00:07:26.040
will it cannot be overstated.

140
00:07:26.280 --> 00:07:29.880
And how significant that is that most people don't realize that you always have

141
00:07:30.320 --> 00:07:33.440
a choice. You are empowered with reason.

142
00:07:33.540 --> 00:07:37.680
You are empowered with knowledge and intellectual capabilities as being a human

143
00:07:37.681 --> 00:07:40.350
being, right? &lt;affirmative&gt; you always have a choice.

144
00:07:40.410 --> 00:07:43.790
And even when you think that the choices are limited, you always have a choice.

145
00:07:44.330 --> 00:07:47.710
So now is the time for people to start waking up and realizing and taking

146
00:07:47.711 --> 00:07:50.110
control of their own lives, live their life.

147
00:07:50.220 --> 00:07:54.550
Like it's the story or a movie that you would watch, right?

148
00:07:54.970 --> 00:07:57.190
It can be full of adventure. It can be full of whatever it is,

149
00:07:57.490 --> 00:08:00.940
but you can become that I'm on the path to doing it. I'm gonna prove it.

150
00:08:01.680 --> 00:08:05.700
So if I can do it and, and, and I have so many things to share about myself.

151
00:08:05.701 --> 00:08:08.900
So I look forward to developing this channel and sharing more about me and my

152
00:08:08.901 --> 00:08:11.980
journey and how I came to this. And so look forward to all that,

153
00:08:12.480 --> 00:08:15.140
but you can do it if I can do it. So can you,

154
00:08:15.450 --> 00:08:18.140
because the last thing you wanna do is become the,

155
00:08:18.310 --> 00:08:20.730
these people that are dying on their death beds. So again,

156
00:08:21.020 --> 00:08:24.370
there are four questions you have to ask yourself, what do you love doing?

157
00:08:24.700 --> 00:08:27.650
Spend time pondering this? You won't figure out in one day,

158
00:08:28.080 --> 00:08:30.370
because there are so many things that you probably love, right?

159
00:08:31.200 --> 00:08:34.850
What are you good at? Well, I'm sure you realize things that you're not good at.

160
00:08:34.870 --> 00:08:36.450
And you're probably thinking, well, I'm good at a bunch of things,

161
00:08:37.110 --> 00:08:40.360
but you have to combine that. And again, it goes back to the VE diagram,

162
00:08:41.110 --> 00:08:44.080
combine all four of these questions. What does the world need?

163
00:08:44.420 --> 00:08:47.400
And how can I make money doing it when you combine these four things?

164
00:08:47.420 --> 00:08:51.000
And this actually is something that I used that took me, oh man,

165
00:08:51.001 --> 00:08:55.040
many weeks of pondering over months and months to be able to figure it out.

166
00:08:55.120 --> 00:08:55.560
So it's something.

167
00:08:55.560 --> 00:08:58.360
<v 1>You might not be able to figure out in one day, but the bottom line is this.</v>

168
00:08:58.780 --> 00:08:59.760
The world's getting crazy.

169
00:09:00.460 --> 00:09:02.720
We all have choices and the world is what we make of it.

170
00:09:03.020 --> 00:09:05.680
And your life is your own story. It's your own journey.

171
00:09:06.300 --> 00:09:10.320
And don't become part of this demographic of people that are falling into

172
00:09:10.321 --> 00:09:13.040
depression that are falling into disengagement at work.

173
00:09:13.480 --> 00:09:16.150
Cuz I know that many people watching this are, but you have a choice.

174
00:09:16.170 --> 00:09:18.030
And today is the day that you decide, you know what?

175
00:09:18.330 --> 00:09:20.390
I'm gonna identify what my life purpose is.

176
00:09:20.690 --> 00:09:23.030
I'm gonna learn what my life purpose is and I'm going to live it.

177
00:09:23.940 --> 00:09:26.710
I'll leave it at that guys. I'm Jimmy, this is bright insight.

178
00:09:26.950 --> 00:09:30.430
I look forward to reading comments on this and I hope this brings fulfillment to

179
00:09:30.630 --> 00:09:32.590
somebody. This video might not be for everyone,

180
00:09:32.610 --> 00:09:34.670
but I'm sure that if it's not for you,

181
00:09:34.671 --> 00:09:37.020
it certainly for somebody that you know in your own life,

182
00:09:37.120 --> 00:09:38.580
but I'll leave it at that.

183
00:09:38.900 --> 00:09:41.580
I have many videos to come and hold wide variety of topics.

184
00:09:42.170 --> 00:09:42.820
Take care of everybody.
