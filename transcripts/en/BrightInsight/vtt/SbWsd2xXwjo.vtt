00:00:00.510 --> 00:00:05.370
<v 0>The largest stone columns ever moved or erected are located at the Heliopolis</v>

2
00:00:05.460 --> 00:00:06.750
and Baalbek Lebanon.

3
00:00:07.080 --> 00:00:11.640
And this video is essentially a continuation of my last video stating that the

4
00:00:11.641 --> 00:00:15.810
Romans did not have the physical or technological capabilities to move or lift

5
00:00:15.811 --> 00:00:20.460
these massive stone blocks that make up the foundation of the Heliopolis. Now,

6
00:00:20.461 --> 00:00:23.580
when you look at these columns, they are absolutely massive,

7
00:00:23.670 --> 00:00:28.620
66 feet high or 19 meters, 8.2 feet wide,

8
00:00:28.621 --> 00:00:32.850
or nearly two and a half meters wide. And they're made up of solid rows,

9
00:00:32.851 --> 00:00:35.160
granite or cyanide, a little bit of both,

10
00:00:35.161 --> 00:00:37.830
depending on which columns you actually look at at this site,

11
00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:40.470
just compare these columns to people.

12
00:00:40.471 --> 00:00:43.170
So you can get an understanding of just how massive they truly are,

13
00:00:43.380 --> 00:00:47.160
but what's even more interesting is that they're nearly twice the size of Greek

14
00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:48.990
columns. Take, for example,

15
00:00:48.991 --> 00:00:52.650
the Parthenon located at the Acropolis in Athens Greece,

16
00:00:53.040 --> 00:00:56.550
these columns are 34 feet high or 10.4 meters,

17
00:00:56.790 --> 00:01:01.620
and about 6.2 feet wide, or 1.9 meters. And they're made up of limestone,

18
00:01:01.950 --> 00:01:04.740
but the columns located in a Baalbek again made up of rows,

19
00:01:04.741 --> 00:01:09.300
granite and cyanides were moved from 1,440 kilometers away,

20
00:01:09.301 --> 00:01:10.830
or just shy of 900 miles.

21
00:01:10.831 --> 00:01:15.450
And this is according to mainstream academics that credit the Aswan Cory for

22
00:01:15.451 --> 00:01:20.400
being the location for these stones were sourced from why on earth would

23
00:01:20.401 --> 00:01:21.960
they move something so massive?

24
00:01:21.961 --> 00:01:24.900
And if anyone could tell me the weight of these actual columns,

25
00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:27.990
because each column has made up of several different pieces,

26
00:01:27.991 --> 00:01:30.000
it might be five give or take. And again,

27
00:01:30.001 --> 00:01:32.580
remember these are 66 feet high in total.

28
00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:35.370
So if you have more than a hundred columns at this site,

29
00:01:35.371 --> 00:01:38.670
which I'll discuss in a second, you have a few hundred different pieces,

30
00:01:38.671 --> 00:01:41.010
which are, I mean, I don't know someone leave a comment again,

31
00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:44.160
if you can estimate the weight of these, I don't know, 10, 15 tons,

32
00:01:44.161 --> 00:01:46.740
maybe more a piece in a few hundred,

33
00:01:46.741 --> 00:01:50.370
them moved nearly a thousand miles. So again,

34
00:01:50.371 --> 00:01:54.240
why would they go to such an incredible extent to move these pieces from such a

35
00:01:54.241 --> 00:01:56.370
far distance to this site? Now,

36
00:01:56.371 --> 00:02:00.390
these columns made up the temple of Baucus and the temple of Jupiter,

37
00:02:00.391 --> 00:02:03.840
but both of these temples are located on the Heliopolis,

38
00:02:03.841 --> 00:02:07.440
which in itself is something like five meters higher than the ground around it.

39
00:02:08.010 --> 00:02:10.620
But when you enter the Heliopolis, when you climb up into it,

40
00:02:11.070 --> 00:02:12.570
the temple of Jupiter, for example,

41
00:02:12.571 --> 00:02:17.520
is seven meters or 23 feet higher than the actual foundation of the site

42
00:02:17.521 --> 00:02:21.930
itself. Now, speaking of the temple of Bacchus, which is made up of 42 columns,

43
00:02:21.990 --> 00:02:26.700
eight along each end, 15, along each side, and again, 66 feet high.

44
00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:30.000
And the temple of Jupiter is made up of 54 columns,

45
00:02:30.001 --> 00:02:31.860
which only a few are still standing by the way,

46
00:02:31.861 --> 00:02:35.100
they've come down from various earthquakes over the millennia,

47
00:02:35.490 --> 00:02:39.330
but yet 10 in front and back in 19 along each side.

48
00:02:39.840 --> 00:02:43.020
And if you're interested in, what's actually inside the temple of Bacchus,

49
00:02:43.050 --> 00:02:43.980
since I'm mentioning it,

50
00:02:43.981 --> 00:02:46.620
you can take a look here as the other columns are inside,

51
00:02:47.020 --> 00:02:50.430
and you can see there's some sort of alter. And if you look back at the doorway,

52
00:02:50.700 --> 00:02:52.290
look at just how high up that is.

53
00:02:52.291 --> 00:02:54.360
And especially when you compare it to other people,

54
00:02:54.510 --> 00:02:57.840
but if you take a closer look at the doorway itself, look at the shape of it.

55
00:02:58.190 --> 00:03:00.520
It's the shape of a trapezoid, which is very similar.

56
00:03:00.521 --> 00:03:01.990
And I've mentioned this in other videos,

57
00:03:02.260 --> 00:03:05.200
the similarities from different cultures across multiple continents,

58
00:03:05.201 --> 00:03:08.650
whether it's the pre Lincolns in south America and Peru,

59
00:03:08.770 --> 00:03:12.460
or the Egyptians that all utilize the same type of shape for doorways.

60
00:03:12.640 --> 00:03:16.180
Is that just a coincidence or is it further evidence that ancient human

61
00:03:16.181 --> 00:03:20.170
civilization was once a global civilization, as I mentioned in many videos.

62
00:03:20.500 --> 00:03:23.560
So the question becomes, how did they lift these massive columns? Well,

63
00:03:23.561 --> 00:03:27.340
we know that they sat the individual pieces of the columns on top of each other,

64
00:03:27.670 --> 00:03:30.580
but then when you look at the remaining standing columns at the temple of

65
00:03:30.581 --> 00:03:33.610
Jupiter, the freeze blocks located at the top,

66
00:03:33.910 --> 00:03:37.180
the smallest of which weigh approximately 66 tons.

67
00:03:37.360 --> 00:03:42.220
And the corner piece has been estimated between 108 and 110

68
00:03:42.221 --> 00:03:43.054
tons,

69
00:03:43.180 --> 00:03:47.620
and was somehow lifted more than 19 meters or nearly 63 feet off the

70
00:03:47.621 --> 00:03:51.760
ground. Now, mainstream academics gives sole credit to this entire site,

71
00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:54.310
to the Romans. Now, in my prior video,

72
00:03:54.311 --> 00:03:58.120
I discussed the capabilities and limitations of the strongest Roman crane in

73
00:03:58.121 --> 00:04:02.230
existence, which had a maximum lift of approximately 6.6,

74
00:04:02.740 --> 00:04:07.360
us tons and mainstream academics will tell you that because the Roman cranes

75
00:04:07.361 --> 00:04:11.050
could not possibly lift anything this high 63 feet off the ground,

76
00:04:11.470 --> 00:04:15.010
they must have created some sort of unknown support structure in order to

77
00:04:15.011 --> 00:04:18.340
elevate the cranes. So wait a second. Essentially,

78
00:04:18.341 --> 00:04:22.420
they would need to have 17 of these Roman cranes surrounding one of these

79
00:04:22.421 --> 00:04:24.940
columns in order to lift that block to the top. That's,

80
00:04:25.270 --> 00:04:28.180
that's just not feasible. And speaking of not feasible,

81
00:04:28.181 --> 00:04:31.420
let me mention a few things that I should've mentioned from my prior video

82
00:04:31.421 --> 00:04:35.170
involving moving the massive 900 ton trial with on stones.

83
00:04:35.560 --> 00:04:39.550
Many comments I received on that video were from people discussing the video of

84
00:04:39.551 --> 00:04:41.230
a gentleman named Wally from Michigan,

85
00:04:41.260 --> 00:04:45.970
where he himself lifts or wrecks a 20 ton stone all by himself through

86
00:04:45.971 --> 00:04:47.410
simply moving dirt,

87
00:04:47.440 --> 00:04:52.060
moving weight and utilizing pressurized water through a hose in order to

88
00:04:52.090 --> 00:04:54.310
displace the weight. And it will erect itself.

89
00:04:54.311 --> 00:04:55.960
It's absolutely brilliant by the way,

90
00:04:56.260 --> 00:05:00.130
but there are a few things wrong with this brilliant theory on why it would not

91
00:05:00.131 --> 00:05:03.340
work over here at the Heliopolis with the trial Fon stones. I mean,

92
00:05:03.610 --> 00:05:06.970
I imagine just first of all, there's no space to work with. I mean,

93
00:05:06.971 --> 00:05:10.270
this is when you see the demonstration, they do it on the ground,

94
00:05:10.810 --> 00:05:12.910
but over at the Heliopolis, you're building a wall.

95
00:05:12.940 --> 00:05:16.180
So did they just keep moving dirt up? And another question becomes,

96
00:05:16.181 --> 00:05:18.250
what did they use for pressurized water? I mean,

97
00:05:18.251 --> 00:05:22.000
surely they didn't have electric motors or gas engines to pump water, did they?

98
00:05:22.330 --> 00:05:24.100
But the very nature of the method itself,

99
00:05:24.130 --> 00:05:27.010
there's a big difference between moving one block on top of the other and

100
00:05:27.011 --> 00:05:30.820
erecting a stone. You really just need to watch that video for yourself.

101
00:05:30.850 --> 00:05:32.470
So you can see one that it's brilliant,

102
00:05:32.471 --> 00:05:36.580
but two that it just won't work based on the very nature and the structure of

103
00:05:36.581 --> 00:05:39.160
the Heliopolis itself. It just doesn't make sense. Now,

104
00:05:39.161 --> 00:05:42.010
some of the other comments they got where people suggesting the wait a second,

105
00:05:42.011 --> 00:05:44.500
they would have used ramps and probably elephants too,

106
00:05:44.501 --> 00:05:48.400
in order to pull these massive 900 ton stones up and put them in place.

107
00:05:48.400 --> 00:05:50.170
But wait a second here first,

108
00:05:50.560 --> 00:05:54.070
imagine on how big this ramp would have to be for it to be an incline.

109
00:05:54.160 --> 00:05:57.800
That's at least shallow enough for anyone to pull something, you know,

110
00:05:57.801 --> 00:06:01.640
that's over 2 million pounds up. It, it would have to have a very low grade.

111
00:06:01.641 --> 00:06:03.380
So in other words, this thing would have to extend out.

112
00:06:03.381 --> 00:06:06.200
I don't even know how many hundreds of feet, but furthermore,

113
00:06:06.230 --> 00:06:09.470
are we supposed to believe that for each stone going from left to right,

114
00:06:09.620 --> 00:06:12.860
they would have had to move this entire ramp over again and, and not,

115
00:06:12.890 --> 00:06:13.723
not to mention,

116
00:06:14.180 --> 00:06:17.930
did they have some sort of steamroller cause imagine on how tight you would have

117
00:06:17.931 --> 00:06:21.500
to pack in that dirt in order to support the weight of something that weighs a

118
00:06:21.501 --> 00:06:24.710
couple million pounds going up at otherwise, the dirt would just displace it.

119
00:06:25.160 --> 00:06:27.800
So we're supposed to believe that they just did it back and forth for each

120
00:06:27.801 --> 00:06:29.270
stone. I mean,

121
00:06:29.300 --> 00:06:33.950
even take a look at inside the Heliopolis the massive 800 and even 900

122
00:06:33.951 --> 00:06:35.750
ton stone blocks that are inside of it,

123
00:06:35.751 --> 00:06:38.180
which I already mentioned the more than five meters off the ground.

124
00:06:38.810 --> 00:06:43.250
So we supposed to believe that they moved tens of thousands, presumably meters,

125
00:06:43.280 --> 00:06:47.270
cubic meters of dirt in and out of the Heliopolis to do low stones,

126
00:06:47.690 --> 00:06:50.960
to just moving them back and forth. And again, going to, you know,

127
00:06:50.961 --> 00:06:52.100
to the elephant argument,

128
00:06:52.101 --> 00:06:56.210
I almost forgot to mention how many elephants would you need to pull a 900 ton

129
00:06:56.600 --> 00:06:56.781
stones? Well,

130
00:06:56.781 --> 00:07:00.020
I did some research and apparently one male elephant can pull somewhere between

131
00:07:00.021 --> 00:07:04.310
nine and 10 tons. So if we're talking about a 900 ton stone guys,

132
00:07:04.311 --> 00:07:07.220
that's about 90 elephants, nine zero.

133
00:07:07.670 --> 00:07:09.440
And that's assuming that they didn't need more than that.

134
00:07:09.740 --> 00:07:11.090
Since if you're going up an incline,

135
00:07:11.091 --> 00:07:14.000
you would need more elephants to support that additional weight.

136
00:07:14.540 --> 00:07:18.170
But just thinking about the distance from the front elephant to the stone,

137
00:07:18.200 --> 00:07:18.381
I mean,

138
00:07:18.381 --> 00:07:22.100
we're talking about presumably a couple hundred feet because how many elephants

139
00:07:22.101 --> 00:07:23.570
can you fit in a row?

140
00:07:24.260 --> 00:07:28.910
So how far could they possibly get one of these stones up to the trial of fond

141
00:07:28.911 --> 00:07:30.830
wall? Do you see what I'm saying? It doesn't make sense.

142
00:07:30.831 --> 00:07:33.080
The elephants are gonna fall off. They couldn't get it close enough.

143
00:07:33.710 --> 00:07:37.880
And these stones are aligned perfectly, but this is where people will say that,

144
00:07:37.881 --> 00:07:40.580
wait a second, you're just not giving humans enough credit. No,

145
00:07:40.760 --> 00:07:44.720
that's not it I'm not giving the Romans the credit because they did not have the

146
00:07:44.721 --> 00:07:47.450
physical or technological capabilities. And by the way,

147
00:07:47.810 --> 00:07:50.900
the Romans recorded everything. And yet it's unexplainable,

148
00:07:51.050 --> 00:07:53.150
it's unknown who built the temple of Jupiter.

149
00:07:53.240 --> 00:07:55.250
It's unknown who constructed the temple of,

150
00:07:55.430 --> 00:07:59.150
or the Heliopolis foundation itself because the Romans don't credit anyone for

151
00:07:59.151 --> 00:08:01.040
it. Isn't that odd. Now,

152
00:08:01.041 --> 00:08:03.980
another point that has to be mentioned is that when you look at the quarry,

153
00:08:04.040 --> 00:08:08.120
the 1200 ton stone block, as well as the 1800 ton stone block,

154
00:08:08.360 --> 00:08:11.360
which mainstream academics say that they cut and carved these stones.

155
00:08:11.361 --> 00:08:13.940
And once they realized they were too heavy to move, they just abandoned them.

156
00:08:14.030 --> 00:08:17.090
But Graham Hancock has an excellent point about that, which is that,

157
00:08:17.091 --> 00:08:17.924
wait a second.

158
00:08:18.260 --> 00:08:21.290
When you look at all the other blocks that make up the Heliopolis that are on

159
00:08:21.291 --> 00:08:22.970
top of these massive stones,

160
00:08:23.420 --> 00:08:27.680
are we supposed to believe that these people were just too dumb to cut up the

161
00:08:27.681 --> 00:08:30.320
unused massive stone blocks located at the quarry?

162
00:08:30.710 --> 00:08:34.820
Think about how much more difficult it is to cut stones out of the bedrock when

163
00:08:34.821 --> 00:08:37.580
they could simply slice up these other massive stones,

164
00:08:37.581 --> 00:08:40.430
but yet they didn't do that. That doesn't make any sense.

165
00:08:40.760 --> 00:08:44.360
This ties into what Graham Hancock has also stated about humans being a species

166
00:08:44.361 --> 00:08:47.540
with amnesia that we just don't know the true history of our past,

167
00:08:47.930 --> 00:08:51.350
but the evidence continues to Mount that there was some sort of cataclysmic

168
00:08:51.710 --> 00:08:55.710
event that essentially reset mankind approximately 12,000 years ago.

169
00:08:56.010 --> 00:08:58.800
When you look at the evidence of the cataclysmic events at that time and the

170
00:08:58.801 --> 00:08:59.670
younger Dryas,

171
00:09:00.300 --> 00:09:03.330
and when you take a look essentially at these massive stones that are

172
00:09:03.331 --> 00:09:05.220
essentially abandoned here in Baalbek,

173
00:09:05.790 --> 00:09:08.880
could these be evidence of the last remaining things that were being worked on

174
00:09:08.881 --> 00:09:11.160
prior to that cataclysm? I mean,

175
00:09:11.161 --> 00:09:15.990
take a look at the Aswan quarry with the unfinished 1200 ton obelisk

176
00:09:16.320 --> 00:09:18.420
again, the Aswan quarry in Egypt,

177
00:09:18.570 --> 00:09:22.890
which is the same location where mainstream academics and archeologists state

178
00:09:22.891 --> 00:09:27.330
that these rose granite and Sinai columns came from all the way over to Lebanon.

179
00:09:27.331 --> 00:09:30.150
Again, 900 miles away to wrap this up.

180
00:09:30.210 --> 00:09:32.880
I'm not taking any credit away from human capabilities.

181
00:09:32.940 --> 00:09:37.350
Rather the Roman simply did not have the physical or technological capabilities

182
00:09:37.410 --> 00:09:40.740
to construct this site. But again, this is a subject of much debate.

183
00:09:40.741 --> 00:09:44.250
So leave a comment, let me know what your thoughts are, but I'll leave it there.

184
00:09:44.580 --> 00:09:45.870
Like subscribe on Jimmy.

185
00:09:45.871 --> 00:09:48.600
This is bright insight and I have many other videos to come and a whole wide

186
00:09:48.601 --> 00:09:50.580
variety of topics. Take care, everybody.
