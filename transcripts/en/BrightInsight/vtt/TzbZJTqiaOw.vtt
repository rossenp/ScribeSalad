00:00:00.450 --> 00:00:05.280
<v 0>We need to take a closer look at the true origins of mankind and the roots of</v>

2
00:00:05.281 --> 00:00:06.720
ancient human civilization.

3
00:00:07.080 --> 00:00:10.290
And there is no better place to start than the earliest known,

4
00:00:10.291 --> 00:00:12.540
or I should say documented civilization,

5
00:00:12.570 --> 00:00:16.740
which is the Sumerians of ancient Mesopotamia dating back 6,000 years.

6
00:00:17.280 --> 00:00:21.720
And they seem to literally show us multiple individuals flying down and being

7
00:00:21.721 --> 00:00:26.250
greeted by those here on earth, as well as possible knowledge of the cosmos,

8
00:00:26.251 --> 00:00:28.890
including the planets in our very own solar system.

9
00:00:29.430 --> 00:00:30.241
<v 1>And in this video,</v>

10
00:00:30.241 --> 00:00:33.930
I'm going to connect the dots on several key details involving the Sumerians,

11
00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:37.650
the Greek gods and the myths and legends of so many civilizations,

12
00:00:37.651 --> 00:00:42.330
cultures and religions that are shared across multiple continents from around

13
00:00:42.331 --> 00:00:43.380
the world. Now,

14
00:00:43.381 --> 00:00:47.190
let me first mentioned that human civilization does date back much earlier than

15
00:00:47.191 --> 00:00:50.310
the Sumerians of 6,000 years ago. For example,

16
00:00:50.311 --> 00:00:54.120
like I've discussed in other videos go Beckley tat bay in Turkey is dated to be

17
00:00:54.121 --> 00:00:58.410
at least 12,000 years old, thus double the age of the Sumerians.

18
00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:00.210
<v 0>And this side is still a mystery.</v>

19
00:01:00.450 --> 00:01:04.380
Another example involves the rainwater erosion around the limestone bedrock and

20
00:01:04.770 --> 00:01:06.720
closure of the great Sphinx of Giza Egypt,

21
00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:10.890
which states it to be at least double the age of what we were taught in school

22
00:01:10.891 --> 00:01:13.710
and likely to be tens of thousands of years older,

23
00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:16.050
which of course raises many questions.

24
00:01:16.410 --> 00:01:19.980
You may also recall articles from the recent skeletal discovery that dates

25
00:01:19.981 --> 00:01:24.270
modern humans to be closer to 350,000 years old,

26
00:01:24.271 --> 00:01:28.950
or 175,000 years older than previously thought yet,

27
00:01:28.980 --> 00:01:33.870
despite us modern humans existing for more than 300,000 years.

28
00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:38.400
We know so little about our history from even 6,000 years ago with the Sumerians

29
00:01:38.790 --> 00:01:43.560
or even 4,000 years ago with the ancient Egyptians or the ancient Greeks.

30
00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:47.940
Yet we have multiple shared myths and legends involving the story of creation

31
00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:52.680
involving beings coming here and creating modern man as well as legends about

32
00:01:52.681 --> 00:01:55.860
humans living to be hundreds and even thousands of years and age.

33
00:01:55.860 --> 00:01:58.770
And I'll be discussing more details on that in just a moment,

34
00:01:59.040 --> 00:02:01.980
but it's important to keep in mind that over long periods of time,

35
00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:06.300
history turns into legend and legend turns into myth, but at their roots,

36
00:02:06.330 --> 00:02:10.740
myths and legends have some sort of truth within them, whatever that may be.

37
00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:15.810
And the telephone game is a great analogy that shows how easily and quickly

38
00:02:16.080 --> 00:02:18.300
indirect communication can be corrupted.

39
00:02:18.301 --> 00:02:22.380
And it cannot be overstated how significant this is in regards to what we know

40
00:02:22.381 --> 00:02:26.850
about history and how it's virtually impossible for truth to not be lost

41
00:02:27.240 --> 00:02:28.800
through time and translation.

42
00:02:29.160 --> 00:02:32.880
So let me discuss one of the myths that are shared by more than 500

43
00:02:32.881 --> 00:02:36.060
civilizations, cultures and religions from around the world,

44
00:02:36.061 --> 00:02:39.750
including the Sumerians. And that is the myth of a global flood.

45
00:02:39.751 --> 00:02:41.970
And this map is not exactly scientific.

46
00:02:41.971 --> 00:02:45.000
It's something I made to show how widespread this legend actually is.

47
00:02:45.210 --> 00:02:48.630
And most of these dots represent multiple civilizations or cultures,

48
00:02:49.440 --> 00:02:53.040
but what's been commonly referred to as a myth is now considered scientific fact

49
00:02:53.041 --> 00:02:54.390
at least to some degree.

50
00:02:54.391 --> 00:02:57.780
And I'll give more details on that for those who are not familiar with this

51
00:02:57.781 --> 00:02:58.501
information,

52
00:02:58.501 --> 00:03:02.350
but thanks to modern science and data taken from ice core samples from both

53
00:03:02.380 --> 00:03:04.030
Greenland and Antarctica,

54
00:03:04.540 --> 00:03:07.900
we have identified evidence that the earth global sea levels have increased by

55
00:03:07.901 --> 00:03:11.350
more than 400 feet since the height of the last ice age. And of course,

56
00:03:11.351 --> 00:03:14.290
much of that occurred over a period of thousands of years,

57
00:03:14.680 --> 00:03:17.560
but some of it happened in an incredibly short period of time,

58
00:03:17.561 --> 00:03:20.860
as the evidence indicates sudden and rapid sea level change,

59
00:03:21.070 --> 00:03:24.430
perhaps even as much as 30 feet in a 24 hour period,

60
00:03:24.730 --> 00:03:26.350
closer to 12,000 years ago.

61
00:03:26.351 --> 00:03:30.310
And I recommend that you research the younger Dryas impact hypothesis for

62
00:03:30.520 --> 00:03:31.720
details on this evidence,

63
00:03:31.721 --> 00:03:35.020
which is actually overwhelming and completely fascinating.

64
00:03:35.230 --> 00:03:37.510
And of course I've mentioned these details in other videos,

65
00:03:37.511 --> 00:03:41.710
but it has to be repeated as it demonstrates that there is actual physical

66
00:03:41.711 --> 00:03:46.000
scientific evidence to back up something that was once considered a myth.

67
00:03:46.240 --> 00:03:49.210
And like I mentioned, with the telephone game analogy earlier,

68
00:03:49.480 --> 00:03:51.040
the facts get altered over time.

69
00:03:51.041 --> 00:03:54.520
And I think that the biblical story of stating that every mountain on earth was

70
00:03:54.521 --> 00:03:58.600
covered in water as a result of 40 days and nights of rainfall. Well,

71
00:03:59.110 --> 00:04:02.020
to say that every mountain was underwater, isn't accurate,

72
00:04:02.050 --> 00:04:05.440
but perhaps vast areas and regions were covered in water,

73
00:04:05.530 --> 00:04:09.700
but the story was passed down for more than 5,000 years before the Sumerians

74
00:04:09.701 --> 00:04:11.650
actually wrote about it on clay tablets.

75
00:04:11.950 --> 00:04:15.430
So my next point of discussion are legends of extreme longevity,

76
00:04:15.431 --> 00:04:18.400
which is something shared by the Sumerians as well as multiple other

77
00:04:18.401 --> 00:04:21.010
civilizations and religions from across the world,

78
00:04:21.340 --> 00:04:24.250
which is that people once lived to be several hundred years.

79
00:04:24.250 --> 00:04:27.400
And even in some cases, thousands of years and age,

80
00:04:27.610 --> 00:04:31.450
now this is notably discussed in the Bible, but it's also shared in Islam,

81
00:04:31.780 --> 00:04:34.150
Hinduism, Dharma, or Jainism.

82
00:04:34.630 --> 00:04:37.780
They all share legends of people living to be several hundred years and age and

83
00:04:37.781 --> 00:04:39.190
even thousands of years and age,

84
00:04:39.700 --> 00:04:42.910
but it's not just religions specific regions of the world.

85
00:04:42.911 --> 00:04:46.690
Also share this legend as well. For example, Vietnam, ancient Persa,

86
00:04:46.840 --> 00:04:50.530
and other places all discuss these legends now right off the bat.

87
00:04:50.710 --> 00:04:55.450
Some will say that the story from the Bible of Noah living to be 950 years old

88
00:04:55.810 --> 00:05:00.760
must be referring to months because 950 months equates to 79 years in

89
00:05:00.761 --> 00:05:04.600
age of when he would have died. So that of course makes far more sense.

90
00:05:04.900 --> 00:05:05.800
But if that's the case,

91
00:05:05.801 --> 00:05:09.340
then what about those that live to only be a hundred something months in age,

92
00:05:09.790 --> 00:05:13.240
which would put nearly half the biblical list at 12 years old or younger,

93
00:05:13.241 --> 00:05:17.050
and even as young as nine years old when they died and somehow had done so much

94
00:05:17.051 --> 00:05:21.130
in their lives as told in the stories. So that doesn't seem to make sense,

95
00:05:21.131 --> 00:05:24.940
but neither does living to be 950 years old. And like I mentioned,

96
00:05:24.941 --> 00:05:27.910
the Sumerians also share this legend of extreme longevity.

97
00:05:27.970 --> 00:05:31.210
They documented the predelivery and God king list, which by the way,

98
00:05:31.450 --> 00:05:36.370
pre means pre flood and details that tend Sumerian Kings lived to

99
00:05:36.371 --> 00:05:38.440
be tens of thousands of years old.

100
00:05:38.770 --> 00:05:41.380
Obviously that's a ridiculously long period of time,

101
00:05:41.381 --> 00:05:45.190
but what's to say that there isn't some truth to it that perhaps at one point in

102
00:05:45.191 --> 00:05:49.570
the distant past, people live to be significantly older than we do today.

103
00:05:49.870 --> 00:05:51.970
I mean, we're already heading in that direction now,

104
00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:56.050
aren't we look at how we've made massive leaps in stem cell research,

105
00:05:56.051 --> 00:05:59.420
which is looking to be a game changer in modern medicine.

106
00:06:00.050 --> 00:06:03.350
Stem cell treatment has helped athletes with various injuries and they're

107
00:06:03.351 --> 00:06:07.310
calling it a possible breakthrough or game changer for people with multiple

108
00:06:07.311 --> 00:06:08.150
cirrhosis.

109
00:06:08.570 --> 00:06:13.220
Another example is how recently two people had their eyesight restored from stem

110
00:06:13.460 --> 00:06:14.150
cell treatments.

111
00:06:14.150 --> 00:06:17.330
And even early research has shown that stem cell treatment has countered

112
00:06:17.360 --> 00:06:21.260
Alzheimer's development. And this is 2018 research, by the way,

113
00:06:21.770 --> 00:06:26.630
we're also growing new organs on our bodies and even on the bodies of other

114
00:06:26.631 --> 00:06:30.140
animals, such as mice and pigs, which is amazing. And I mean,

115
00:06:30.530 --> 00:06:33.680
we were basically already living in a science fiction world and we don't really

116
00:06:33.681 --> 00:06:36.500
seem to reflect on it much at the pace we're going.

117
00:06:36.501 --> 00:06:40.610
It won't be long before we were replacing our own organs for new ones and using

118
00:06:40.820 --> 00:06:44.840
stem cell treatment to treat our brains when they start to slow from Alzheimer's

119
00:06:44.841 --> 00:06:48.140
or dementia, just think about how amazing these things are.

120
00:06:48.170 --> 00:06:49.760
And this is just the beginning.

121
00:06:49.761 --> 00:06:53.870
It won't be long before the human lifespan is increased significantly,

122
00:06:54.050 --> 00:06:57.440
but if there is some truth to humans, once living extreme lifespans,

123
00:06:57.500 --> 00:07:00.410
when there needs to be some evidence that they were advanced, well,

124
00:07:00.411 --> 00:07:03.590
what most people don't know is that there is existing evidence that ancient

125
00:07:03.591 --> 00:07:07.670
humans were once significantly more advanced than we were ever taught in school.

126
00:07:07.730 --> 00:07:10.520
Take the great pyramid of Giza Egypt. As an example,

127
00:07:10.640 --> 00:07:13.430
whoever built it seemed to know the dimensions of the earth,

128
00:07:13.730 --> 00:07:15.650
and I've discussed this in other videos as well,

129
00:07:15.651 --> 00:07:18.260
but the evidence is remarkably compelling.

130
00:07:18.320 --> 00:07:22.580
The numbers are there and math doesn't lie for more specific details on this.

131
00:07:22.581 --> 00:07:25.400
I highly recommend that you look into the work of Randall Carlson.

132
00:07:25.550 --> 00:07:29.600
He discusses this in great detail and I'll include links to his YouTube and

133
00:07:29.601 --> 00:07:31.640
website in the description of this video.

134
00:07:32.390 --> 00:07:36.740
Also with the great pyramid of Jesus' proximity to the geographical center of

135
00:07:36.741 --> 00:07:41.000
the Earth's landmass, this amazing detail is unknown to most people. And no,

136
00:07:41.001 --> 00:07:44.090
I do not think that this is just a coincidence, but more than that,

137
00:07:44.091 --> 00:07:47.690
it's really important to understand that we also do not know what the original

138
00:07:47.691 --> 00:07:49.760
purpose was for the pyramids. Yes,

139
00:07:49.761 --> 00:07:51.620
we were taught in school that they were tunes,

140
00:07:51.621 --> 00:07:56.600
but there is virtually zero evidence of any kind to even suggest that

141
00:07:56.601 --> 00:07:58.640
they were built for the purpose of being a tomb.

142
00:07:58.910 --> 00:08:02.330
Take it upon yourself to research the great pyramid and alternative theories for

143
00:08:02.331 --> 00:08:02.901
its purpose.

144
00:08:02.901 --> 00:08:06.530
But clearly it was something highly sophisticated and technological.

145
00:08:06.531 --> 00:08:10.160
And when you study the specifics of it, particularly the internal structure,

146
00:08:10.460 --> 00:08:13.100
it becomes clear that we do not know what we're looking at.

147
00:08:13.670 --> 00:08:16.850
And actually this reminds me of a quote from the beginning of the Lord of the

148
00:08:16.851 --> 00:08:19.880
rings movie trilogy. And I'm a total nerd, by the way, thus,

149
00:08:19.881 --> 00:08:24.710
the third age of middle earth began history became legend, legend became myth.

150
00:08:24.770 --> 00:08:28.370
And some things that should not have been forgotten or lost,

151
00:08:28.371 --> 00:08:32.330
and this quote is very fitting for us and the mystery of lost ancient human

152
00:08:32.331 --> 00:08:34.280
civilization. So moving along,

153
00:08:34.281 --> 00:08:37.730
the next point I want to discuss are the myths and legends of creation.

154
00:08:37.850 --> 00:08:41.420
And this is of course found in the most common religions around the world with

155
00:08:41.421 --> 00:08:44.780
legends of angels, demons, sky gods,

156
00:08:44.990 --> 00:08:47.810
all coming here in some way to create modern man.

157
00:08:47.900 --> 00:08:49.910
This legend is shared by the Sumerians as well.

158
00:08:49.911 --> 00:08:53.690
And there are in fact seven tablets, which discuss the story of creation.

159
00:08:54.020 --> 00:08:56.430
So besides the Sumerian solar system tablet,

160
00:08:56.460 --> 00:09:00.390
which may indicate advanced knowledge of the solar system and the planets in it,

161
00:09:00.990 --> 00:09:05.160
there's also a tablet appearing to show three individuals flying down to earth

162
00:09:05.161 --> 00:09:08.850
and being greeted. I mean, what exactly is this depicting?

163
00:09:08.880 --> 00:09:11.580
And there are more than one tablet showing this,

164
00:09:11.581 --> 00:09:14.340
just look at these other two tablets and think for yourself,

165
00:09:14.370 --> 00:09:17.370
what were they trying to tell us? You know,

166
00:09:17.371 --> 00:09:20.460
if you replace words like angels, demons,

167
00:09:20.461 --> 00:09:24.390
or sky gods with the word alien and most of the world's religions,

168
00:09:24.420 --> 00:09:26.910
it would all start to make far more sense. Women,

169
00:09:27.180 --> 00:09:30.960
even similar stories are shared by the Hopi Indians of north America and the

170
00:09:30.961 --> 00:09:32.610
Aborigines of Australia,

171
00:09:32.611 --> 00:09:36.750
which basically tell the same story except that they state that beings came from

172
00:09:36.751 --> 00:09:38.730
underground rather than above.

173
00:09:39.120 --> 00:09:43.800
But just look at the certain examples of Hopi and Aboriginal wall art,

174
00:09:44.160 --> 00:09:48.270
pretty eerie depictions. And it's fascinating when you pair it with this quote,

175
00:09:48.960 --> 00:09:52.200
we do not walk alone, great beings, walk beside us,

176
00:09:52.740 --> 00:09:56.340
know this and be grateful. This brings me to the dead sea scrolls,

177
00:09:56.341 --> 00:10:00.510
which are hidden and preserved in caves on the side of cliffs near the dead sea.

178
00:10:00.870 --> 00:10:04.500
One of the things they found was the book of the Watchers within the book of

179
00:10:04.501 --> 00:10:09.180
Enoch, the Watchers, how creepy is that? Nobody knows who wrote them.

180
00:10:09.210 --> 00:10:13.800
But what I find particularly interesting is that whoever it was went to an

181
00:10:13.801 --> 00:10:18.630
incredible extent to hide and preserve this information included in the book of

182
00:10:18.631 --> 00:10:22.110
the Watchers, which was hidden in a cave on the side of a cliff,

183
00:10:22.410 --> 00:10:26.520
buried in sealed jars, hidden for thousands of years. You know,

184
00:10:26.521 --> 00:10:30.480
this reminds me of the Nazca lines in Peru with the waving astronaut,

185
00:10:30.481 --> 00:10:34.170
which is massive and mostly appreciated from the air because it's on the side of

186
00:10:34.171 --> 00:10:39.000
a mountain and there are also other depictions, but some refer to as runways.

187
00:10:39.030 --> 00:10:42.090
Now this is a mystery. They don't know who made this, or when,

188
00:10:42.540 --> 00:10:44.160
so in regards to creation,

189
00:10:44.161 --> 00:10:47.520
if beings did come here from elsewhere to create modern man,

190
00:10:47.521 --> 00:10:51.000
what they need to have knowledge of DNA and our genetics in order to do

191
00:10:51.001 --> 00:10:54.900
something like that, which by the way is basically what we're already doing now.

192
00:10:55.110 --> 00:10:55.321
I mean,

193
00:10:55.321 --> 00:10:59.460
I shared earlier examples of how we're growing organs and we've also cloned more

194
00:10:59.461 --> 00:11:03.030
than 20 species of animal. And this gets me thinking,

195
00:11:03.060 --> 00:11:07.320
what if the famous lamassoure the wing bulls found in the ancient scenario

196
00:11:07.321 --> 00:11:11.460
region? What if they are actually showing us what someone did now? Of course,

197
00:11:11.461 --> 00:11:12.630
that sounds a bit ridiculous,

198
00:11:12.631 --> 00:11:17.610
but if it were possible to genetically put your head onto the body of a bull or

199
00:11:17.611 --> 00:11:22.560
perhaps maybe a horses body and some wings onto it for show, without a doubt,

200
00:11:22.561 --> 00:11:26.100
I could see various world leaders jumping on that crap in a heartbeat to do it.

201
00:11:26.580 --> 00:11:27.840
And now that's just a fun thought,

202
00:11:27.841 --> 00:11:30.600
but of course the mainstream explanation for the wing bulls is that they're

203
00:11:30.601 --> 00:11:32.490
simply mythological deities,

204
00:11:33.060 --> 00:11:36.690
but it's a curious topic as they made so many of these with such high precision.

205
00:11:36.691 --> 00:11:37.920
In fact, they made hundreds of them,

206
00:11:38.160 --> 00:11:42.480
but it's worth mentioning just how many Sumerian tablets pick humans with wings

207
00:11:42.481 --> 00:11:45.900
and in these same tablets, there are other individuals without wings.

208
00:11:46.170 --> 00:11:50.280
Could this be symbolic of say someone or those that flew here in some way,

209
00:11:50.850 --> 00:11:55.120
or could it simply just depict Kings who were looked at as royalty or godly if

210
00:11:55.121 --> 00:11:57.610
there ever was any type of genetic modification,

211
00:11:57.730 --> 00:12:00.640
they would certainly need to have knowledge of DNA. Like I mentioned earlier,

212
00:12:01.180 --> 00:12:05.230
and there is some evidence to indicate that the ancients were aware of DNA and

213
00:12:05.231 --> 00:12:08.500
the double helix, and also commonly referred to as the caduceus.

214
00:12:08.830 --> 00:12:11.500
This also relates to various legends of the first people,

215
00:12:11.501 --> 00:12:14.920
including the story of Adam and Eve and other legends from around the world and

216
00:12:14.921 --> 00:12:16.150
the tree of knowledge in life.

217
00:12:16.150 --> 00:12:20.200
And could this story be based from the Sumerians because they have tablets that

218
00:12:20.380 --> 00:12:22.150
seem to depict something very similar.

219
00:12:22.570 --> 00:12:27.310
But what I'm most curious about is the missing skeletal link in the evolution of

220
00:12:27.340 --> 00:12:30.790
modern humans. Now real quick, I am not denying evolution.

221
00:12:30.820 --> 00:12:34.120
There is without a doubt evidence of this within the fossil record among

222
00:12:34.121 --> 00:12:37.510
primates. And in fact, hundreds of other species found throughout nature.

223
00:12:37.720 --> 00:12:41.380
In fact, we even see evidence of evolution within language, within culture,

224
00:12:41.410 --> 00:12:44.560
within technology. Even if we study the cosmos,

225
00:12:44.561 --> 00:12:48.700
we see that everything's constantly moving. Even at the atomic level, Adams,

226
00:12:48.701 --> 00:12:51.880
as an example are constantly vibrating. They are never constant.

227
00:12:52.090 --> 00:12:55.990
So perhaps it's a universal law that everything is always in a state of change,

228
00:12:56.140 --> 00:12:59.800
but we are discussing modern humans. And the best example,

229
00:12:59.801 --> 00:13:04.120
they have a physical scientific evidence to support the theory of evolution for

230
00:13:04.121 --> 00:13:07.990
modern humans. It's actually surprising just how weak it really is.

231
00:13:07.991 --> 00:13:10.720
And this refers to a 2015 discovery,

232
00:13:10.721 --> 00:13:14.530
which they consider to be the best example of a missing link skeleton,

233
00:13:14.531 --> 00:13:18.730
but it's only five feet tall. The estimated the weight, a hundred pounds,

234
00:13:19.060 --> 00:13:22.000
the brain was get this the size of an orange,

235
00:13:22.300 --> 00:13:25.780
the fingers even arched in the opposite direction of humans and arts in the

236
00:13:25.781 --> 00:13:29.980
direction of chimps and eights and the feet were quote similar to ours. I mean,

237
00:13:30.130 --> 00:13:33.790
clearly there is a missing chapter in the development of modern day humans,

238
00:13:33.791 --> 00:13:37.510
because how is it that we have so many dinosaur bones from what they say are

239
00:13:37.511 --> 00:13:39.610
from 65 million years ago?

240
00:13:39.611 --> 00:13:44.500
And here we are in 2018 and we have essentially zero skeletons that show

241
00:13:44.501 --> 00:13:49.420
or justify the bridge of evolution to modern humans. So why the sudden jump,

242
00:13:49.421 --> 00:13:52.690
why is there such a mystery involving the massive change in the size of the

243
00:13:52.691 --> 00:13:57.010
brain and the cranial cavity and modern humans? Something doesn't add up now,

244
00:13:57.011 --> 00:14:00.610
some of theorized as a possible explanation for the missing skeletal link of

245
00:14:00.611 --> 00:14:03.730
modern humans is that while we're looking for something that's not supposed to

246
00:14:03.731 --> 00:14:04.570
be there anyways,

247
00:14:04.571 --> 00:14:08.740
that maybe it's related to the various interbreeding or intermixing of various

248
00:14:08.741 --> 00:14:12.640
species of homosapiens, the different branches of them from long ago.

249
00:14:12.641 --> 00:14:15.850
And that perhaps that just isn't supposed to be the skeleton that we're looking

250
00:14:15.851 --> 00:14:19.630
for, but ultimately the fossil record is still lacking all the way around.

251
00:14:19.631 --> 00:14:20.980
So why is that? Now,

252
00:14:20.981 --> 00:14:25.510
what I think is a possibility is that we modern humans have been influenced from

253
00:14:25.511 --> 00:14:26.380
an outside source.

254
00:14:26.381 --> 00:14:31.360
That beings came here and essentially combined us with either Neanderthals or

255
00:14:31.361 --> 00:14:35.530
Denisovans who knows one of those species. And perhaps we're a mix of them.

256
00:14:36.070 --> 00:14:40.330
I mean, Neanderthals and Denisovans went extinct approximately 41,000 years ago.

257
00:14:40.331 --> 00:14:43.510
And it's a mystery. We don't know why either of them went to extinct,

258
00:14:43.511 --> 00:14:47.800
but besides our DNA similarities between Neanderthals and Denisovans,

259
00:14:48.340 --> 00:14:53.240
we were also shocked to learn in just 2016 that we cannot account for a Y

260
00:14:53.241 --> 00:14:56.990
chromosome link between modern males and Neanderthals. Why is that?

261
00:14:57.410 --> 00:15:00.620
And although that may not be evidence of aliens intermixing with us,

262
00:15:00.621 --> 00:15:04.310
it is evidence that we don't know the entire story of our ancestors.

263
00:15:04.610 --> 00:15:07.280
And there are some unexplained gaps in our lineage. I mean,

264
00:15:07.281 --> 00:15:10.790
if they can find evidence of evolution and primates, why not us,

265
00:15:11.000 --> 00:15:15.470
but most of all, there seems to be something out of place among humans. I mean,

266
00:15:15.830 --> 00:15:17.240
we're a bit crazy, don't you think?

267
00:15:17.241 --> 00:15:21.500
And we don't seem to exactly fit in or appear to be part of a natural part of

268
00:15:21.501 --> 00:15:24.320
this environment, because in fact, we're a plague to the planet.

269
00:15:24.350 --> 00:15:26.840
We destroy everything. It's just, something feels off.

270
00:15:26.870 --> 00:15:29.960
And it just doesn't make sense if all the other animals evolved and things

271
00:15:29.961 --> 00:15:34.730
worked out naturally, why are we so much different? But like I said,

272
00:15:34.731 --> 00:15:36.260
if there is any truth to this,

273
00:15:36.380 --> 00:15:39.770
obviously beings would have had to have come here that had advanced knowledge of

274
00:15:39.771 --> 00:15:43.490
DNA genomes. And although we know a lot about DNA, specifically,

275
00:15:43.491 --> 00:15:45.500
the details of the chemical process,

276
00:15:45.950 --> 00:15:48.200
we have not figured out the coding in its entirety.

277
00:15:48.201 --> 00:15:52.100
And it's actually been described as having all the letters of a language,

278
00:15:52.340 --> 00:15:55.250
but not knowing what the language actually is. And in other words,

279
00:15:55.251 --> 00:15:58.160
we do have a lot to learn. So just to clarify,

280
00:15:58.161 --> 00:16:00.590
I am not convinced of an alien hybrid theory. In fact,

281
00:16:00.591 --> 00:16:02.600
there are other theories too, that are worth looking at,

282
00:16:02.840 --> 00:16:04.850
and I'm not trying to convince you of this theory either.

283
00:16:04.851 --> 00:16:07.400
I just simply think that it makes far more sense,

284
00:16:07.820 --> 00:16:10.490
but this theory holds more water than some of the other explanations that have

285
00:16:10.491 --> 00:16:14.030
been shared by mainstream science. And I think it's just worthy of looking at,

286
00:16:14.210 --> 00:16:17.780
in further discussion with an open mind and seeking out new evidence,

287
00:16:17.870 --> 00:16:21.710
but too many people seem to completely shun the possibility of aliens in any

288
00:16:21.711 --> 00:16:22.790
type of conversation.

289
00:16:22.790 --> 00:16:26.240
It's almost as if there's this level of not wanting it to be true,

290
00:16:26.241 --> 00:16:26.990
that people in,

291
00:16:26.990 --> 00:16:31.100
perhaps it could be related to organized religions and academics that all these

292
00:16:31.101 --> 00:16:35.090
teachings would essentially be changed drastically if it turned out that this

293
00:16:35.180 --> 00:16:36.260
was to be true.

294
00:16:36.740 --> 00:16:39.140
So I think that a lot of people are just really uncomfortable with it,

295
00:16:39.200 --> 00:16:42.320
but it doesn't mean that there isn't some truth to it in some way.

296
00:16:42.440 --> 00:16:44.840
This reminds me of an excellent quote by Aristotle,

297
00:16:44.841 --> 00:16:49.700
which is it is the mark of an educated mind to be able to entertain a thought

298
00:16:49.730 --> 00:16:53.030
without accepting it. So obviously, if any of this is true,

299
00:16:53.031 --> 00:16:56.870
it raises so many questions and possibilities. Why did they do this?

300
00:16:56.871 --> 00:16:58.790
Why did they come here? Are we part of an experiment?

301
00:16:59.030 --> 00:17:03.290
Are they trying to spread intelligent life throughout the galaxy where the here

302
00:17:03.291 --> 00:17:06.800
to observe us and do whatever and control us? I mean, who knows?

303
00:17:06.801 --> 00:17:09.560
There are so many unknowns things that we just don't know,

304
00:17:09.710 --> 00:17:12.770
but what I do know is human behavior. And if we could,

305
00:17:13.070 --> 00:17:16.490
we would literally be watching other civilizations from across the galaxy,

306
00:17:16.730 --> 00:17:20.810
like the best reality TV show ever that we would never get bored of. I mean,

307
00:17:20.811 --> 00:17:24.110
I wouldn't be surprised if we're being observed from other intelligent beings,

308
00:17:24.111 --> 00:17:26.540
whether it's from close or afar. I mean,

309
00:17:26.541 --> 00:17:28.910
we have to remind ourselves that ever since 1939,

310
00:17:28.911 --> 00:17:30.680
with the opening of the Olympic games,

311
00:17:31.160 --> 00:17:35.150
our television waves have been broadcasted out into space in basically every

312
00:17:35.151 --> 00:17:39.050
direction at the speed of light for 79 years now,

313
00:17:39.051 --> 00:17:43.820
which means that any civilization that's intelligent 79 years, light years away,

314
00:17:43.821 --> 00:17:48.500
which is incredibly far by the way, would know about our existence possibly.

315
00:17:48.680 --> 00:17:51.780
Now some instantly just blow this off and say no spaces too far.

316
00:17:51.780 --> 00:17:54.330
It's not meant to be traveled. It's impossible. But I mean,

317
00:17:54.331 --> 00:17:59.220
look how much we've accomplished in the last 100 years, telephones cell phones,

318
00:17:59.550 --> 00:18:03.330
internet computers, cars, airplanes, everything else. I mean,

319
00:18:03.331 --> 00:18:07.080
what are we going to be capable of a hundred years from now or 500 years from

320
00:18:07.081 --> 00:18:08.640
now, or a thousand years from now?

321
00:18:08.641 --> 00:18:12.210
So things that we once thought were crazy and impossible turn out to be true.

322
00:18:12.211 --> 00:18:16.260
So we shouldn't just say that the distance means that this is impossible,

323
00:18:16.410 --> 00:18:17.370
but with all this said,

324
00:18:17.371 --> 00:18:20.610
we need to take a closer look at the similarities among the different

325
00:18:20.611 --> 00:18:23.760
civilizations from across the continents, including the Greek gods,

326
00:18:23.820 --> 00:18:27.120
the Roman gods, the Indian gods, the Sumerian gods, and others,

327
00:18:27.480 --> 00:18:30.540
perhaps the various myths from across different corners of the world,

328
00:18:30.541 --> 00:18:34.260
all originate from the same thing. Anyways, guys, I'm going to close this up,

329
00:18:34.261 --> 00:18:37.560
but leave a comment and share your thoughts and insight on this topic,

330
00:18:37.561 --> 00:18:40.830
because obviously there's so much more information that is worthy of being

331
00:18:40.831 --> 00:18:43.530
mentioned in this video that I didn't have time to fit in.

332
00:18:43.531 --> 00:18:46.500
So there will be other videos in the future on this topic as well.

333
00:18:46.890 --> 00:18:49.740
But I'm Jimmy, this is bright insight like and subscribe and leave me a comment.

334
00:18:49.741 --> 00:18:51.300
And I have many more videos to come soon.

335
00:18:51.301 --> 00:18:55.180
I should have another video up later this weekend or early next week and have

336
00:18:55.181 --> 00:18:58.320
another video just a few days after that. So take care of everybody.
