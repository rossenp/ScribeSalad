1
00:00:00.690 --> 00:00:03.900
<v 0>In my first two videos on the topic of the lost city of Atlantis,</v>

2
00:00:03.960 --> 00:00:07.350
I connected the dots and more than he doesn't similarities between Plato's

3
00:00:07.351 --> 00:00:10.710
description of Atlantis to that of the recon structure,

4
00:00:10.711 --> 00:00:13.740
which is commonly referred to as the IO, the Sahara,

5
00:00:14.010 --> 00:00:18.030
and is located in a remote region of Northwest Africa in the country of

6
00:00:18.031 --> 00:00:18.864
Mauritania.

7
00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:23.700
And my argument in those videos was that these similarities are so numerous and

8
00:00:23.701 --> 00:00:28.500
so precise that the recut structure should be considered as the most likely

9
00:00:28.501 --> 00:00:31.380
location for this lost ancient civilization.

10
00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:35.670
<v 1>However, nothing is certain, and it is undoubtedly the subject of much debate.</v>

11
00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:37.740
But if after watching those first two videos,

12
00:00:37.741 --> 00:00:41.610
you still doubted the possibility that the recut structure could be the location

13
00:00:41.611 --> 00:00:44.100
of Atlantis. Well, in this video,

14
00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:47.370
I'm going to share with you some new details that I just came across.

15
00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:52.560
That makes the case that the eye of Africa is not just the most likely location

16
00:00:52.561 --> 00:00:56.300
of Atlantis, but the connection of these out of details, I'm about to share.

17
00:00:56.370 --> 00:01:00.150
<v 0>It makes this case so compelling that it's practically definitive.</v>

18
00:01:00.450 --> 00:01:03.720
So then we jump right into these details and afterwards I'll connect the dots on

19
00:01:03.721 --> 00:01:06.360
everything. So we can see exactly what we're dealing with here.

20
00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:08.400
Like I stated in my first video,

21
00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:12.600
the legend of Atlantis originates from the ancient Egyptians and the Greek law

22
00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:12.961
maker,

23
00:01:12.961 --> 00:01:17.640
Solon recorded this information while visiting Egypt some 2,600 years

24
00:01:17.641 --> 00:01:22.200
ago. And the information was passed down through six generations to Plato who

25
00:01:22.201 --> 00:01:24.600
published the account of Atlantis in the tomatoes.

26
00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:27.960
And Criteo has dialogues some 2,400 years ago.

27
00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:31.650
And is apparently the only reason why we know about the legend of Atlantis

28
00:01:31.651 --> 00:01:32.484
today,

29
00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:37.080
Play-Doh stated that the king of the capital of Atlantis was named Atlas,

30
00:01:37.230 --> 00:01:41.220
who is the first born son of Poseidon. And of course, like I mentioned before,

31
00:01:41.370 --> 00:01:45.600
Poseidon had 10 children through five sets of twins and each one of those 10

32
00:01:45.601 --> 00:01:50.310
children went on to rule each of those 10 kingdoms that made up the empire of

33
00:01:50.311 --> 00:01:51.660
Atlantis. Now,

34
00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:56.670
remember the name Atlas and hold that thought for a moment as I share something

35
00:01:56.671 --> 00:01:59.430
else that will connect the dots on this new information,

36
00:01:59.760 --> 00:02:03.720
there is a group of people that used to be referred to as the Mori. However,

37
00:02:03.721 --> 00:02:06.870
in modern times, they are now known as the Berber people,

38
00:02:07.140 --> 00:02:09.630
which inhabit a region of Northwest Africa,

39
00:02:10.140 --> 00:02:13.770
our region once referred to as Maury, but now known as Maghreb,

40
00:02:14.280 --> 00:02:18.660
which essentially makes up modern day, new media, Morocco, west Algeria,

41
00:02:18.690 --> 00:02:20.970
and Mauritania. In fact,

42
00:02:20.971 --> 00:02:24.270
the name Mauritania comes from the Maury people. Now,

43
00:02:24.271 --> 00:02:27.480
does anyone happen to know the name of who was said to be the first king of

44
00:02:27.481 --> 00:02:29.010
Mauritania? Well,

45
00:02:29.011 --> 00:02:32.490
it was someone who just so happened to be named Atlas,

46
00:02:32.550 --> 00:02:37.500
the legendary king of the Mauri people, what a coincidence,

47
00:02:37.530 --> 00:02:41.010
but of course there can be no possible connection to Atlas,

48
00:02:41.011 --> 00:02:43.350
the king of Atlantis, because after all,

49
00:02:43.620 --> 00:02:47.250
there is simply no way that Atlantis could ever have been in the remote region

50
00:02:47.520 --> 00:02:50.850
of Northwest Africa. Now, hold that thought for a moment, too,

51
00:02:50.851 --> 00:02:53.850
as I share something else with you that you've likely never seen or heard of

52
00:02:53.851 --> 00:02:54.630
before,

53
00:02:54.630 --> 00:02:58.980
there was an ancient Greek man named [inaudible] who lived some 2,500 years,

54
00:02:59.680 --> 00:03:03.790
who you may be familiar with as being known as the father of history made famous

55
00:03:03.791 --> 00:03:08.470
for his documentation of the Greco Persian wars Heraclitus was born nearly

56
00:03:08.471 --> 00:03:11.770
75 years after Solon had died. And again,

57
00:03:11.771 --> 00:03:14.890
Solon was the person who documented the story of Atlantis from the ancient

58
00:03:14.891 --> 00:03:19.360
Egyptians carotid, SIS himself also died when Plato was just two years old.

59
00:03:19.361 --> 00:03:23.680
So he never knew either of them and subsequently died many years before Plato

60
00:03:23.681 --> 00:03:26.020
had ever published the account of Atlantis.

61
00:03:26.260 --> 00:03:29.440
One of [inaudible] notable achievements was developing.

62
00:03:29.441 --> 00:03:33.970
What was then the most accurate mapping of the known inhabited world at the time

63
00:03:33.971 --> 00:03:37.690
of four 50 BC. First that's oriented ourselves here.

64
00:03:37.691 --> 00:03:40.720
We can clearly see Italy, the Mediterranean sea,

65
00:03:40.750 --> 00:03:44.140
the countries that surrounded the Caspian sea, the red sea,

66
00:03:44.141 --> 00:03:46.900
the Nile Delta to name a few notable features.

67
00:03:47.290 --> 00:03:50.350
And let me transition to a different version of the map so we can see things

68
00:03:50.351 --> 00:03:54.910
more clearly. But if you look to the left, what do you see there?

69
00:03:55.300 --> 00:03:57.340
That's right. The word Atlantis,

70
00:03:57.341 --> 00:04:01.480
which is shown to be located south of the pillars of Hercules or the Strait of

71
00:04:01.481 --> 00:04:06.250
Gibraltar and positioned in Northwest Africa. Let me first say that.

72
00:04:06.251 --> 00:04:08.140
I do not know how or why Hurghada is.

73
00:04:08.320 --> 00:04:11.560
This came to this conclusion as this is something that I need to research more,

74
00:04:11.561 --> 00:04:14.860
but I look forward to any insight that people will be sharing in the comments

75
00:04:14.861 --> 00:04:18.760
related to his development of this map and why he claimed that Atlantis was in

76
00:04:18.761 --> 00:04:22.570
that specific location. You'll also notice on this map,

77
00:04:22.600 --> 00:04:24.310
the detailing of a mountain chain,

78
00:04:24.550 --> 00:04:28.660
just south of the Strait of Gibraltar known today as the Atlas mountains,

79
00:04:28.960 --> 00:04:32.770
which are also known to be home of the Berber people, which I mentioned earlier,

80
00:04:33.220 --> 00:04:36.550
and these mountains were in fact named after Atlas,

81
00:04:36.580 --> 00:04:39.160
the first king of Mauritania, you know,

82
00:04:39.161 --> 00:04:42.190
something else that's interesting to point out when you research Atlas,

83
00:04:42.191 --> 00:04:46.060
the king of Mauritania, there seems to be no connection to Atlantis.

84
00:04:46.420 --> 00:04:49.990
I assume that this is related to the fact that nobody has ever considered that

85
00:04:49.991 --> 00:04:54.010
the location of Atlantis could be hiding in plain sight in the Western Sahara

86
00:04:54.011 --> 00:04:56.560
desert in what is now Mauritania.

87
00:04:56.950 --> 00:05:00.340
Let me take a quick moment to thank John for leaving this outstanding comment,

88
00:05:00.370 --> 00:05:03.070
which brought the information of the first king of Mauritania,

89
00:05:03.071 --> 00:05:05.530
as well as Hurghada. This is mapped to my attention,

90
00:05:05.800 --> 00:05:07.870
something that I was otherwise unaware of,

91
00:05:07.871 --> 00:05:10.960
and I suspect that goes to most everyone else watching this video.

92
00:05:11.350 --> 00:05:13.330
So let me clarify where we're at right now.

93
00:05:13.360 --> 00:05:18.190
There is a 2,500 year old map that annotates the location of Atlantis

94
00:05:18.340 --> 00:05:19.600
in Northwest Africa,

95
00:05:19.810 --> 00:05:23.680
seemingly in the exact location of the recon structure.

96
00:05:23.710 --> 00:05:27.490
And this map was created by the so-called father of history,

97
00:05:27.850 --> 00:05:32.080
a trusted source of documentation praised by modern day historians,

98
00:05:32.081 --> 00:05:36.850
for his ability to systematically document information in vivid detail,

99
00:05:37.210 --> 00:05:42.070
then we have this mysterious and incredibly unique structure in Mauritania known

100
00:05:42.071 --> 00:05:46.630
as the re caught this structure just so happens to be made of

101
00:05:46.631 --> 00:05:50.890
concentric circles just as Plato had stated, but not only that,

102
00:05:50.891 --> 00:05:53.560
it consists of the precise amount of rings,

103
00:05:53.830 --> 00:05:57.890
three that would be of water and two of land on top of that,

104
00:05:57.891 --> 00:06:02.870
it just so happens to be the precise size of how Atlantis was

105
00:06:02.871 --> 00:06:07.370
described measuring 23 and a half kilometers or 14 and a half miles

106
00:06:07.371 --> 00:06:12.350
across when computed in modern day measurements and also has an opening to

107
00:06:12.351 --> 00:06:15.980
the south that would match Atlanta's description of connecting to the sea.

108
00:06:16.010 --> 00:06:20.210
And in fact, it's very appearance today seems to suggest that it did,

109
00:06:20.900 --> 00:06:22.460
it has mountains to the north.

110
00:06:22.520 --> 00:06:26.000
And not only that the mountains to the north contained rivers,

111
00:06:26.510 --> 00:06:30.170
the entire area surrounding the Ricard is a large level plane.

112
00:06:30.770 --> 00:06:35.060
The sides of Atlantis were said to be steeped towards the side of the sea and

113
00:06:35.061 --> 00:06:39.710
the Audra Highlands located in this area have a steep 1500 foot drop

114
00:06:39.920 --> 00:06:43.730
from cliff side to its base. Even more significantly.

115
00:06:43.731 --> 00:06:47.630
The center island of the recon produces fresh spring water just as Play-Doh

116
00:06:47.631 --> 00:06:48.530
specified.

117
00:06:48.830 --> 00:06:52.760
And this is despite the Wells in the surrounding area producing exclusively salt

118
00:06:52.761 --> 00:06:57.080
water, which also is further evidence that this site was once under the ocean.

119
00:06:57.470 --> 00:07:01.910
The area around the recut has an abundance of black, red and white color stone.

120
00:07:02.360 --> 00:07:05.030
And Atlantis was said to have an abundance of elephants,

121
00:07:05.031 --> 00:07:07.640
which elephants exist in Mauritania today.

122
00:07:07.670 --> 00:07:12.260
And depictions of elephants can be seen in cave art close to the recon

123
00:07:12.270 --> 00:07:16.250
structure. There are even relics, including pottery shards, arrowheads,

124
00:07:16.251 --> 00:07:19.220
and other evidence that he civilization once lived there yet.

125
00:07:19.460 --> 00:07:24.260
Archeologists have no idea what civilization they belong to or when,

126
00:07:24.710 --> 00:07:29.510
and all of this is in Mauritania where people who were once known as the Maury

127
00:07:29.511 --> 00:07:33.980
people were led by a legendary king, whose name was Atlas,

128
00:07:34.250 --> 00:07:37.700
the same exact name as the king of Atlantis.

129
00:07:37.730 --> 00:07:40.010
But on top of all of this,

130
00:07:40.130 --> 00:07:44.870
it just so happens to be in the exact location that is annotated on an

131
00:07:44.900 --> 00:07:49.760
ancient map that was created by who we refer to as the father of history.

132
00:07:50.330 --> 00:07:54.290
I mean, this is an X marks, the spot if there ever was one,

133
00:07:54.320 --> 00:07:59.210
especially when you consider the nature of the many precise similarities between

134
00:07:59.211 --> 00:08:03.620
the recut structure and Plato's description of Atlantis. Now, for me,

135
00:08:03.680 --> 00:08:08.330
this is more than compelling. This is Atlantis despite the fact that yes,

136
00:08:08.331 --> 00:08:12.830
this site today is nearly 1300 feet above sea level because the scientific

137
00:08:12.831 --> 00:08:16.880
explanation for the ricotta creation would make sense for it to be Atlantis.

138
00:08:16.881 --> 00:08:20.300
When you simply compare it to what Plato had stated about Atlantis is

139
00:08:20.301 --> 00:08:24.890
destruction describing how an earthquake caused Atlantis to sink into the depths

140
00:08:24.891 --> 00:08:29.420
of the ocean. Perhaps that earthquake was the ricotta itself. For example,

141
00:08:29.421 --> 00:08:33.230
scientists believe it went through multiple processes of being lifted up and

142
00:08:33.231 --> 00:08:36.950
down as it subsurface dome collapsed and later lifted again,

143
00:08:37.220 --> 00:08:41.750
a process that was repeated multiple times and creating the concentric circles

144
00:08:41.751 --> 00:08:46.220
that we see today. I mean, geologists literally describe it as a dome.

145
00:08:46.221 --> 00:08:51.170
So the subsurface dome collapsed Atlantis sank also explaining the

146
00:08:51.171 --> 00:08:53.270
earthquake. I mean, this seems fitting,

147
00:08:53.271 --> 00:08:57.150
especially when we acknowledge all of the matching precise similarities to what

148
00:08:57.151 --> 00:08:59.880
play two, it said such as the concentric circles,

149
00:08:59.881 --> 00:09:04.800
specifically three of water and two of land it's precise size and everything

150
00:09:04.801 --> 00:09:09.000
else. It certainly seems definitive to me as this far exceeds coincidence.

151
00:09:09.001 --> 00:09:10.380
And you know, that reminds me,

152
00:09:10.381 --> 00:09:14.670
I received a comment from someone claiming to live in Mauritania and going on to

153
00:09:14.671 --> 00:09:18.510
mention that locals have seen various fish skeletons in the [inaudible]

154
00:09:18.720 --> 00:09:21.540
following rainstorms. If this is true,

155
00:09:21.541 --> 00:09:25.680
I might be willing to pay as much as 1000 us dollars for evidence of that.

156
00:09:26.250 --> 00:09:31.110
If it can be video recorded in such a way that any viewer would see and know

157
00:09:31.111 --> 00:09:32.970
that the evidence was not planted.

158
00:09:33.300 --> 00:09:37.980
And if the video included detailed Panorama shots of the [inaudible] plus video

159
00:09:37.981 --> 00:09:42.750
of the GPS location, et cetera, if this is true, well, I can't help,

160
00:09:42.751 --> 00:09:46.470
but think that the significant difference in value between us dollars and the

161
00:09:46.471 --> 00:09:48.420
currency of Mauritania, well,

162
00:09:48.450 --> 00:09:52.110
perhaps even just a few hundred us dollars would make it more than worth it to

163
00:09:52.111 --> 00:09:56.220
go out there and take pictures of any evidence that can be found seashells,

164
00:09:56.221 --> 00:09:59.880
whatever, but I'll get back to that in just a moment first,

165
00:09:59.881 --> 00:10:03.300
then they also mentioned that there is evidence that this region was under the

166
00:10:03.301 --> 00:10:06.420
ocean far more recently than the tens of millions of years.

167
00:10:06.420 --> 00:10:10.710
That some people claim as non fossilized whale bones have been found in the

168
00:10:10.711 --> 00:10:11.910
desert of Mauritania.

169
00:10:12.480 --> 00:10:15.690
And this example you're seeing here should not be confused with a different

170
00:10:15.691 --> 00:10:19.590
discovery in the Egyptian desert of actual fossils of whale bones.

171
00:10:20.040 --> 00:10:23.340
And you can clearly see the difference for yourself as fossils are essentially

172
00:10:23.341 --> 00:10:26.130
bones that over millions of years became stone.

173
00:10:26.760 --> 00:10:31.080
So if scientists claim that it takes more than a million years for bones to

174
00:10:31.081 --> 00:10:32.370
become fossils,

175
00:10:32.700 --> 00:10:36.030
why are there non fossilized whale bones in the desert of Mauritania,

176
00:10:36.570 --> 00:10:39.240
but getting back to my potential offer to pay,

177
00:10:39.241 --> 00:10:41.580
to see evidence of sea life at the [inaudible]

178
00:10:41.580 --> 00:10:41.580
. I received a number of outstanding comments of people that searched

179
00:10:41.580 --> 00:10:41.580
 the recut structure through Google earth and provided the coordinates to

180
00:10:41.580 --> 00:10:41.580
 some very interesting satellite images of potential structures on the ground. 

181
00:10:41.580 --> 00:10:41.580
What are these were

182
00:10:41.580 --> 00:10:42.413
 these made in modern times here, you can see various satellite photos of these structures followed by a zoomed out view.

183
00:11:01.590 --> 00:11:04.110
So you can see where they were taken in relation to the [inaudible]

184
00:11:04.110 --> 00:11:04.110
. But look at this one, located in the center island of the recut, it almost looks like the outline of a castle or something. Perhaps there is a simple explanation for it, but I might be willing to pay several hundred us dollars just to see a photo of what this looks like from the ground. It cannot be overstated just how remote this site is and how little it is visited. This is not a tourist attraction. This thing is in the middle of nowhere. And this is just another example of why the 

185
00:11:04.110 --> 00:11:04.110
recut needs to be studied from the ground and excavated. And getting back to 

186
00:11:04.110 --> 00:11:04.110
Hurghada. This is

187
00:11:04.110 --> 00:11:04.110
 map. I mean, were you even aware of a 2,500 year old map showing the location of Atlantis 

188
00:11:04.110 --> 00:11:04.110
in

189
00:11:04.110 --> 00:11:04.943
 Northwest Africa? I mean, I'm sure some people have heard of it, but I went ahead and did a word scan through my YouTube creator dashboard of all the comments I've received in my two videos on Atlantis.

190
00:11:55.000 --> 00:11:59.590
And it appears that only four people mentioned this map just four

191
00:11:59.890 --> 00:12:04.870
out of nearly 25,000 comments between my two previous videos on Atlantis.

192
00:12:05.110 --> 00:12:08.530
In other words, it's fair to say that pretty much nobody has heard of this.

193
00:12:08.770 --> 00:12:12.460
And it's also worth pointing out that this map shows the Nile river going from

194
00:12:12.490 --> 00:12:16.030
east to west as various legends have long stated. And you know,

195
00:12:16.150 --> 00:12:17.410
this reminds me of a detail.

196
00:12:17.411 --> 00:12:21.220
I pointed out in my previous video involving the recent land survey of

197
00:12:21.221 --> 00:12:24.820
Mauritania that identified a massive river that once ran through it,

198
00:12:25.300 --> 00:12:27.910
it seems to me that this river may have been the Nial,

199
00:12:27.911 --> 00:12:31.990
a possibility that hopefully scientists will research more in the future,

200
00:12:32.200 --> 00:12:32.831
but of course,

201
00:12:32.831 --> 00:12:36.580
many people rule out the possibility of the eye of the Sahara being a possible

202
00:12:36.581 --> 00:12:40.570
location of Atlantis due to its current elevation above sea level.

203
00:12:40.571 --> 00:12:43.090
And I understand where people are coming from,

204
00:12:43.240 --> 00:12:46.240
but it really is time that we start asking new questions about what's

205
00:12:46.241 --> 00:12:50.770
geologically possible on this planet over a certain length of time in regards to

206
00:12:50.771 --> 00:12:53.890
land movements. It's right here in our faces guys.

207
00:12:53.920 --> 00:12:58.750
And this discovery provides us with such a huge opportunity to not only learn

208
00:12:58.751 --> 00:13:00.220
about the lost civilization,

209
00:13:00.221 --> 00:13:03.400
but learn about the workings of planet earth as well.

210
00:13:03.700 --> 00:13:06.850
We cannot assume that we know all there is to know. Now,

211
00:13:06.851 --> 00:13:09.850
let me take a moment to address a couple of points of discussion that came up

212
00:13:09.851 --> 00:13:12.820
following my previous Atlanta's videos. For instance,

213
00:13:12.821 --> 00:13:17.140
I use the example of flood map.net to paint a picture for the viewer of how the

214
00:13:17.560 --> 00:13:21.580
recut structure could be a feasible location and design for Atlantis.

215
00:13:21.880 --> 00:13:24.820
If the area was at sea level, some 12,000 years ago,

216
00:13:25.390 --> 00:13:28.000
many people commented stating that if this were the case,

217
00:13:28.030 --> 00:13:29.980
Egypt would have to be under the ocean as well.

218
00:13:29.981 --> 00:13:34.090
But I'm suggesting that a region of the Western Sahara was lifted.

219
00:13:34.091 --> 00:13:37.690
I am not suggesting that the ocean was some 1500 feet higher.

220
00:13:38.140 --> 00:13:40.870
And since there is no land rise.net,

221
00:13:41.200 --> 00:13:43.960
the flood map.net comparison was just what I said.

222
00:13:43.961 --> 00:13:47.620
It was in that video to paint you a picture of what the ricotta and surrounding

223
00:13:47.621 --> 00:13:50.440
area would look like if it ever was at sea level.

224
00:13:50.710 --> 00:13:54.340
Another point I want to bring up is in regards to my Antartica comparison in

225
00:13:54.341 --> 00:13:57.910
relation to the speed at which land can rise over a period of time,

226
00:13:58.390 --> 00:14:02.050
some have pointed out that the article I use stated that Antarctica is rising

227
00:14:02.051 --> 00:14:06.610
because the land is being lifted back up as the ice melts causing something like

228
00:14:06.611 --> 00:14:07.570
a sponge effect.

229
00:14:07.571 --> 00:14:11.230
And those are my own words by the way of the rising of the land with the reduced

230
00:14:11.231 --> 00:14:12.820
weight of the last ice.

231
00:14:12.850 --> 00:14:16.990
But there is more to this and the article specifically mentions it being pushed

232
00:14:16.991 --> 00:14:20.950
up by the flowing mantle beneath, like I said, in my prior video,

233
00:14:20.980 --> 00:14:25.330
I use this comparison to simply point out that it is possible for land to rise

234
00:14:25.331 --> 00:14:28.720
at a certain speed over a certain period of time. However,

235
00:14:28.750 --> 00:14:33.280
the recon is a volcanic anomaly and that's what volcanic activity does.

236
00:14:33.281 --> 00:14:36.820
It raises the ground. I think that most people understood what I was saying,

237
00:14:36.821 --> 00:14:38.380
but the skeptics jumped on this.

238
00:14:38.381 --> 00:14:41.920
And I would just like to encourage people to think for themselves because that

239
00:14:41.921 --> 00:14:45.670
same article mentioned not one single word about volcanoes underneath

240
00:14:45.671 --> 00:14:46.504
Antarctica.

241
00:14:46.840 --> 00:14:50.680
Yet we know that there are at least 91 volcanoes underneath its ice.

242
00:14:50.900 --> 00:14:54.290
Although scientists have not confirmed if those volcanoes are active or not,

243
00:14:54.320 --> 00:14:59.240
but surely some of them are considering that there are at least 400

244
00:14:59.420 --> 00:15:01.520
subglacial lakes underneath that ice.

245
00:15:01.910 --> 00:15:05.570
Obviously something is melting it to create those lakes that are underneath as

246
00:15:05.571 --> 00:15:07.430
much as two miles of ice.

247
00:15:07.850 --> 00:15:11.570
And it seems to me that the Antarctica land rise is related to that volcanic

248
00:15:11.571 --> 00:15:12.404
activity.

249
00:15:12.560 --> 00:15:16.460
Not because there's less ice and land is rising like a sponge or something,

250
00:15:16.461 --> 00:15:20.330
but that point is irrelevant because going back to the recuts,

251
00:15:20.360 --> 00:15:21.890
they haven't even drilled it.

252
00:15:22.280 --> 00:15:26.420
This illustration you see here is just that an educated guess as to what's

253
00:15:26.421 --> 00:15:27.560
happened underneath.

254
00:15:27.860 --> 00:15:31.520
And apparently many scientists who have speculated about the recut have never

255
00:15:31.521 --> 00:15:34.460
actually visited the site in person. So keep that in mind.

256
00:15:34.880 --> 00:15:38.690
So to close this video trilogy on the topic of Atlantis and the recut structure,

257
00:15:38.720 --> 00:15:41.270
let me just say that I have not discovered anything.

258
00:15:41.540 --> 00:15:45.770
I only discovered a little known documentary on the topic of Atlantis and I am

259
00:15:45.771 --> 00:15:48.890
simply sharing that information with as many people as I possibly can.

260
00:15:49.070 --> 00:15:50.570
And that is the purpose of this channel.

261
00:15:50.571 --> 00:15:54.560
I have no desire to have something published in some scientific journal that's

262
00:15:54.561 --> 00:15:56.810
for other nerds. I'm, I'm a different type of nerd.

263
00:15:57.170 --> 00:15:59.360
And nerd is a term of endearment. By the way, for me,

264
00:15:59.600 --> 00:16:03.080
my desire is to share information that I find interesting or important with the

265
00:16:03.081 --> 00:16:03.591
masses.

266
00:16:03.591 --> 00:16:07.130
And I will be discussing many different topics on this channel and in the future

267
00:16:07.280 --> 00:16:10.490
I'll will even be remaking certain videos I have now that already have millions

268
00:16:10.491 --> 00:16:13.610
of views, as I'm trying to build the quality of this channel.

269
00:16:13.610 --> 00:16:16.070
And some of those videos, just the presentation,

270
00:16:16.160 --> 00:16:19.160
various inaccuracies and the information, the editing,

271
00:16:19.430 --> 00:16:21.080
there's just a lot of room for improvement.

272
00:16:21.081 --> 00:16:22.850
So look forward to that and keep in mind,

273
00:16:22.851 --> 00:16:27.380
I do 100% of this myself and I'm learning as I go, as far as my editing skills,

274
00:16:27.381 --> 00:16:30.800
as well as just my delivery in front of the camera. And that reminds me,

275
00:16:30.801 --> 00:16:34.250
I will also be making a video in the future to talk more about me and who I am

276
00:16:34.251 --> 00:16:36.830
and what brought me on this journey to making YouTube videos.

277
00:16:37.190 --> 00:16:39.320
So look forward to that. But like I've said before,

278
00:16:39.321 --> 00:16:41.000
this is just the beginning of this channel.

279
00:16:41.001 --> 00:16:44.960
There is so much to be shared with the masses that far exceeds the topic of

280
00:16:44.961 --> 00:16:47.270
ancient civilization. That's just one thing.

281
00:16:47.360 --> 00:16:51.080
Humanity is starting to wake up to various truths and I am going to accelerate

282
00:16:51.081 --> 00:16:54.020
that awakening. And I'm going to make some real noise while doing it,

283
00:16:54.050 --> 00:16:57.710
mark my words, but I'll leave it at that. I'm Jimmy,

284
00:16:57.711 --> 00:17:00.860
this is bright insights like and subscribe and leave me a comment and let me

285
00:17:00.861 --> 00:17:04.480
know what your thoughts are and all of this involving Atlantis and the ricotta

286
00:17:04.481 --> 00:17:05.720
structure. But to me,

287
00:17:05.990 --> 00:17:10.340
this is just so compelling that this requires excavation at this point.

288
00:17:10.341 --> 00:17:12.350
So I'll just leave it at that.

289
00:17:12.530 --> 00:17:14.840
I have a new video coming out around this time next week.

290
00:17:14.841 --> 00:17:17.680
So look forward to that, but take care, everybody.
