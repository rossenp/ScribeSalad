00:00:02.700 --> 00:00:06.200
<v 0>The pyramids of Egypt were not built to be tombs. In fact,</v>

2
00:00:06.410 --> 00:00:10.160
there was something far more sophisticated, a technology of some kind.

3
00:00:10.700 --> 00:00:11.533
And in this video,

4
00:00:11.580 --> 00:00:15.480
I'm gonna connect the dots on key pieces of evidence from videos that I've made

5
00:00:15.481 --> 00:00:18.040
ranging from Ola Tesla to the ancient Egyptians.

6
00:00:18.420 --> 00:00:22.160
And I believe that Ola Tesla's concept for wireless free energy,

7
00:00:22.161 --> 00:00:26.310
right outta the air crust is the missing key to understanding this lost ancient

8
00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:28.710
technology, because make no mistake.

9
00:00:29.090 --> 00:00:33.310
The ancient Egyptians that we learned about in school from 4,500 years ago did

10
00:00:33.311 --> 00:00:37.270
not construct the great pyramid of Giza or the spanks and real quick, no,

11
00:00:37.271 --> 00:00:39.950
this is not a video about aliens or some conspiracy. No,

12
00:00:40.210 --> 00:00:41.750
the truth is stranger than fiction.

13
00:00:42.330 --> 00:00:46.620
And the true history of ancient human civilization is far older and was far more

14
00:00:46.621 --> 00:00:49.420
advanced than what we were taught in school. Take for example,

15
00:00:49.720 --> 00:00:53.900
the great Sphinx of Giza hundreds of professional geologists from around the

16
00:00:53.901 --> 00:00:58.060
world have concluded that the water rain erosion around the enclosure of the

17
00:00:58.420 --> 00:01:02.460
Finks is so significant that this had to have happened in prehistoric times.

18
00:01:02.970 --> 00:01:06.210
Keep in mind at the spins is carved out of this limestone bedrock.

19
00:01:06.670 --> 00:01:10.130
So the age of the erosion has to be the age of the spins no less.

20
00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:13.850
And considering the fact that the Nile Delta region has not received significant

21
00:01:14.210 --> 00:01:17.370
rainfall since 7,000 BC or 9,000 years ago,

22
00:01:17.480 --> 00:01:21.490
more than double the age of this 4,200 year estimate. In fact,

23
00:01:21.730 --> 00:01:23.250
evidence outlined by Dr. Robert shock,

24
00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:28.280
a doctor from Yale university has concluded that the evidence is so significant

25
00:01:28.830 --> 00:01:33.240
that it would've required at least 20 to 30,000 years of heavy

26
00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:36.920
rainfall in order to cost this type of erosion and hundreds of other

27
00:01:36.921 --> 00:01:40.440
professional geologists who do this for a living have said the same thing,

28
00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:44.560
something particularly interesting about that 30,000 year estimate is the fact

29
00:01:44.561 --> 00:01:47.510
that the are two pieces of evidence from the ancient Egyptians,

30
00:01:47.511 --> 00:01:51.670
that detail lineage of the pharaohs dating back more than 30,000 years,

31
00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:55.110
which has always been dismissed by mainstream archeologists and Egyptologists.

32
00:01:55.650 --> 00:01:57.470
So just to clarify what we're dealing with here,

33
00:01:57.850 --> 00:02:02.030
the scientific evidence proves that the great Sphinx was constructed in

34
00:02:02.140 --> 00:02:05.110
prehistoric times, which leads right up to the Sumer.

35
00:02:05.900 --> 00:02:07.060
Who'll be mentioning later in this video,

36
00:02:07.440 --> 00:02:12.220
I'm not suggesting that the dynastic Egyptians from 4,500 so years ago did not

37
00:02:12.250 --> 00:02:13.780
mess around with ancient Egypt,

38
00:02:13.781 --> 00:02:17.220
that they did not do things to the casing stones of the great pyramid of Giza.

39
00:02:17.640 --> 00:02:20.660
In fact, we already know that somebody had reshaped the SP's head,

40
00:02:20.960 --> 00:02:23.940
but when you look into the details of the internal structure of the great

41
00:02:23.941 --> 00:02:25.740
pyramid of Giza, and I made a video on this and a,

42
00:02:25.870 --> 00:02:28.930
of course include a link that will pop up at the end of this video.

43
00:02:29.760 --> 00:02:32.690
It's not hard to see that this is something far different than a tomb and the

44
00:02:32.850 --> 00:02:37.690
evidence to completely suggest that it wasn't a tomb is so overwhelming besides

45
00:02:37.691 --> 00:02:41.010
the fact that there was never one single mummy found in any of the pyramids of

46
00:02:41.011 --> 00:02:42.410
Giza, which most people don't realize.

47
00:02:42.710 --> 00:02:47.240
The only evidence to even suggest that these were tombs is this sarcophagus

48
00:02:47.241 --> 00:02:49.440
shape box found inside the King's chamber. However,

49
00:02:49.510 --> 00:02:53.320
this box was constructed with tooling that was far less superior than whatever

50
00:02:53.340 --> 00:02:57.320
cut and carved these massive stone blocks inside the King's chamber itself and

51
00:02:57.321 --> 00:03:01.680
throughout the pyramid was seemingly laser cut, precision take, for example,

52
00:03:01.710 --> 00:03:03.160
this shaft inside the King's chamber,

53
00:03:03.920 --> 00:03:08.760
a watertight shaft that was formed from three different pieces of stone.

54
00:03:08.840 --> 00:03:11.720
I mean, talk about doing something as difficult as possible.

55
00:03:12.140 --> 00:03:16.440
What's far more likely is that the same ego driven Pharaoh who reshaped the

56
00:03:16.720 --> 00:03:19.750
Spinks? His head probably came in here thousands of years ago and said, Hey,

57
00:03:19.751 --> 00:03:20.670
I wanna be buried in here.

58
00:03:20.730 --> 00:03:24.110
And when you consider that the passageway inside and out of the King's chamber

59
00:03:24.111 --> 00:03:27.670
cannot fit this sarcophagus, all the evidence indicates.

60
00:03:27.671 --> 00:03:29.230
And as you can see in these photos here,

61
00:03:29.660 --> 00:03:33.390
that this was once something else and they simply reshaped it and broke it in

62
00:03:33.391 --> 00:03:37.670
the process and used these terrible cutting tools in order to shape it. I mean,

63
00:03:37.671 --> 00:03:41.060
just look at the missing floor tiles that were there. And I it's,

64
00:03:41.300 --> 00:03:44.580
I would even argue that maybe there was no tiles or flooring in that spot

65
00:03:44.780 --> 00:03:45.520
altogether.

66
00:03:45.520 --> 00:03:48.540
And that you're simply looking at the debris of whatever was once there,

67
00:03:48.860 --> 00:03:49.693
whatever it was.

68
00:03:50.080 --> 00:03:54.380
And essentially what we're now looking at is a massive misrepresentation of

69
00:03:54.580 --> 00:03:55.820
whatever the original structure was.

70
00:03:56.160 --> 00:04:00.690
And we also have to keep in mind that as we keep finding these acid chambers and

71
00:04:00.691 --> 00:04:02.690
unknown cavities inside the pyramid itself,

72
00:04:03.190 --> 00:04:05.130
we just don't know everything there is to know about it.

73
00:04:05.230 --> 00:04:06.970
But as I've outlined in a different video,

74
00:04:07.500 --> 00:04:11.650
every single theory that has been proposed by Egyptologists and archeologists on

75
00:04:11.670 --> 00:04:15.610
how the ancient Egyptians could have cut and carved stone has been debunked

76
00:04:16.120 --> 00:04:19.050
besides the fact that they haven't even found saws that could have done this,

77
00:04:19.051 --> 00:04:22.400
or even of the size when they've tested these methods anyways,

78
00:04:22.450 --> 00:04:24.840
every single one of them completely failed.

79
00:04:24.840 --> 00:04:26.800
And here's what that thumbnail looks like.

80
00:04:26.840 --> 00:04:28.560
I recommend you watch this video at the end,

81
00:04:28.561 --> 00:04:32.400
as I include various video clips that show that every method just could not have

82
00:04:32.401 --> 00:04:32.770
done it,

83
00:04:32.770 --> 00:04:37.040
which I believe is further evidence to suggest that the pyramid of Giza was

84
00:04:37.240 --> 00:04:40.440
constructed in prehistoric times. We don't know who, how or when,

85
00:04:40.860 --> 00:04:42.670
just like with the greats Finks. I mean,

86
00:04:42.671 --> 00:04:46.750
wouldn't that explain why out of the tens of thousands of hieroglyphs and

87
00:04:46.751 --> 00:04:50.350
petroglyphs located throughout ancient Egypt, not one single one of them,

88
00:04:50.700 --> 00:04:54.710
zero mentions anything whatsoever about the FIS or the pyramids.

89
00:04:55.160 --> 00:04:58.830
Isn't that really odd? So, as I mentioned, this structure,

90
00:04:59.230 --> 00:05:02.380
would've been something far more sophisticated and I will leave that it involves

91
00:05:02.860 --> 00:05:05.940
Ola, Teslas theory and concept for wireless energy.

92
00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:09.860
And it's really hard to imagine charging your cell phone out of a stack of

93
00:05:09.861 --> 00:05:10.694
bricks and blocks,

94
00:05:11.080 --> 00:05:15.060
but let's just move into what we do know the largest structures that are built

95
00:05:15.120 --> 00:05:19.380
by man are dams and facilities for generating electricity.

96
00:05:20.040 --> 00:05:24.010
And when you consider just how close the Nile river used to be in fact,

97
00:05:24.011 --> 00:05:26.970
eight miles closer to the pyramids going right up to the steps, actually,

98
00:05:27.150 --> 00:05:30.850
as you can see evidence here from where the water line used to be when you

99
00:05:30.851 --> 00:05:32.850
combine that with newfound evidence,

100
00:05:33.010 --> 00:05:36.850
although this dates back several years now that there is a massive complex of

101
00:05:36.851 --> 00:05:40.690
tunnels chambers and caves underneath the Giza plateau,

102
00:05:41.090 --> 00:05:43.520
it has been described as being a massive aquifer.

103
00:05:43.620 --> 00:05:46.800
And you can see evidence of these chefs even right on top of the Giza plateau,

104
00:05:46.801 --> 00:05:50.640
these massive chefs that are plummeting more than a hundred feet down,

105
00:05:50.641 --> 00:05:55.000
many of them, and keep in mind this isn't cut out of dirt or sandstone.

106
00:05:55.001 --> 00:05:57.320
This is limestone bedrock, and there are many of them.

107
00:05:57.321 --> 00:06:00.120
And some of them you can even tell, and this is a few photos,

108
00:06:00.121 --> 00:06:03.360
courtesy of Brian Forester that they seem to channel water.

109
00:06:03.780 --> 00:06:05.880
And as you can see in other chambers or shafts,

110
00:06:05.881 --> 00:06:08.160
I should say they connect to horizontal tunnels.

111
00:06:08.161 --> 00:06:10.120
And there's other evidence of this on the plateau as well.

112
00:06:10.460 --> 00:06:13.880
So when you consider the fact that there's a massive cave tunnel and chamber

113
00:06:13.940 --> 00:06:17.510
system underneath the PLA the pyramids that they haven't even excavated,

114
00:06:17.570 --> 00:06:19.870
at least. So they say, I mean, isn't that weird.

115
00:06:20.370 --> 00:06:22.870
And the fact that we don't even know everything that's inside the great pyramid

116
00:06:22.930 --> 00:06:24.790
itself, we have to start asking questions.

117
00:06:25.090 --> 00:06:29.630
And when Ola Tesla adamantly stated that he had created the technology

118
00:06:30.210 --> 00:06:34.030
to harness energy out of the earth crust. And you may remember the Tesla tower,

119
00:06:34.031 --> 00:06:38.500
which was by the way, built above an aquifer yet, for some reason,

120
00:06:38.640 --> 00:06:41.460
JP Morgan decided to remove his funds. And for some reason, I mean,

121
00:06:41.461 --> 00:06:43.300
he stood to make more money doing other things.

122
00:06:44.300 --> 00:06:46.980
Ola Tesla was so adamant that he had mastered this ability,

123
00:06:47.010 --> 00:06:50.780
this knowledge on how to harness energy from the earth that he wrote JP Morgan,

124
00:06:51.320 --> 00:06:54.500
nearly one letter every single month for five years,

125
00:06:55.170 --> 00:06:59.170
insisting that he had mastered this te and he needed the funds in order to

126
00:06:59.330 --> 00:07:01.930
complete it. In fact, a month before Tesla's death,

127
00:07:02.110 --> 00:07:06.010
he was telling people that he had perfected this and had the intellectual

128
00:07:06.290 --> 00:07:07.650
property. And as you can see here,

129
00:07:07.651 --> 00:07:09.690
this is all its left and never came to fruition.

130
00:07:10.550 --> 00:07:14.010
What's interesting is that Nicola Tesla is somebody that's known for outstanding

131
00:07:14.120 --> 00:07:19.120
character and integrity and 80% approximately of the technology that we

132
00:07:19.121 --> 00:07:22.920
use every single day in our lives is a direct result of either his works or

133
00:07:22.921 --> 00:07:26.800
inventions. He's the guy that mastered the technology for the AC current,

134
00:07:26.801 --> 00:07:30.640
which of course powers the virtually the entire electrical grid of the entire

135
00:07:30.641 --> 00:07:32.760
world. He also invented the electric motor.

136
00:07:32.830 --> 00:07:35.960
Most people take for granted on just how many different things they use in their

137
00:07:35.961 --> 00:07:36.161
lives.

138
00:07:36.161 --> 00:07:39.710
And here's just a couple examples every single day that used an electric motor.

139
00:07:40.140 --> 00:07:41.870
Most people don't even know who Tesla was.

140
00:07:42.530 --> 00:07:46.510
He also invented the remote control and even the radio as the Supreme court

141
00:07:46.511 --> 00:07:50.310
overruled the patent that was awarded to Marconey and received it back to Tesla,

142
00:07:50.311 --> 00:07:51.350
following his death,

143
00:07:51.860 --> 00:07:54.470
even various aspects of his inventions and the works that he had done.

144
00:07:54.470 --> 00:07:57.830
Others went on to complete the television, the computer, the laser,

145
00:07:57.930 --> 00:08:02.740
the x-ray robotics can all be credited to Tesla's earliest works in his lifelong

146
00:08:02.741 --> 00:08:05.900
achievements. He also in 1926,

147
00:08:06.120 --> 00:08:10.580
epicly described a cell phone as well as the FaceTime and Skype applications.

148
00:08:10.581 --> 00:08:12.180
And press pause real quick to read this.

149
00:08:12.880 --> 00:08:16.980
So when Tesla was adamant that he had perfected the ability to harness energy

150
00:08:16.981 --> 00:08:19.140
from the earth, should we really doubt him?

151
00:08:19.570 --> 00:08:23.570
So if the great pyramid of Giza was somehow a structure that could harness

152
00:08:23.750 --> 00:08:26.010
energy out of the earth, as I am suggesting,

153
00:08:26.090 --> 00:08:28.930
I think it's the most likely possibility. Maybe it was something else.

154
00:08:29.550 --> 00:08:30.490
It wasn't a tomb.

155
00:08:30.550 --> 00:08:32.810
So we have to ask questions and there are many different theories,

156
00:08:33.550 --> 00:08:37.210
but when you look at the exact location of the great pyramid of Giza,

157
00:08:37.360 --> 00:08:41.120
many people don't realize that it's located at the precise geographical center

158
00:08:41.180 --> 00:08:44.800
of all land mass of planet earth, keyword, land mass,

159
00:08:45.460 --> 00:08:48.960
and many people also are not aware that this was going to be the location.

160
00:08:49.260 --> 00:08:53.040
The pyramids of Giza were going to be the location of the prime Meridian.

161
00:08:53.041 --> 00:08:55.040
And back in the 18 hundreds, when they had to vote on this,

162
00:08:55.670 --> 00:08:58.760
they decided to go with green witch, England because of London's, uh,

163
00:08:58.761 --> 00:09:02.120
Harbor and incredibly busy shipping lanes in and out of the English channel,

164
00:09:02.121 --> 00:09:03.840
which are still the busiest on planet earth.

165
00:09:04.100 --> 00:09:07.720
So in order to reduce confusion with time zones, they chose green witch,

166
00:09:07.750 --> 00:09:10.720
England over the geese of plateau.

167
00:09:11.010 --> 00:09:13.000
Isn't that fascinating that the most largest,

168
00:09:13.150 --> 00:09:15.390
most mysterious and precise structure ever built,

169
00:09:15.900 --> 00:09:18.190
just so happens to be located in this location.

170
00:09:18.300 --> 00:09:21.710
Perhaps this has something to do with the ability to harness energy out of the

171
00:09:21.711 --> 00:09:25.230
ground. We have to ask ourselves, why did whoever built this?

172
00:09:25.490 --> 00:09:27.910
Why did they choose to make it so big and so tall,

173
00:09:28.530 --> 00:09:31.470
why these specific measurements and keep in mind,

174
00:09:31.471 --> 00:09:33.790
we don't even know where that capstone is. And many have theorized.

175
00:09:33.791 --> 00:09:34.624
It could have been gold,

176
00:09:35.110 --> 00:09:38.180
which would of course be great for transmitting electricity,

177
00:09:38.181 --> 00:09:41.180
but also would explain why it's well missing and stolen.

178
00:09:41.480 --> 00:09:43.740
So as we discuss the measurements of the pyramid,

179
00:09:44.000 --> 00:09:45.980
you need to look into the works of Randall Carlson.

180
00:09:45.981 --> 00:09:48.020
I'll include links for his website and YouTube channel.

181
00:09:48.260 --> 00:09:51.220
I highly recommend that you look into his works. It's unbelievable.

182
00:09:51.880 --> 00:09:53.220
He takes all the calculations,

183
00:09:53.250 --> 00:09:56.610
notable calculations of the exact measure of the great pyramid,

184
00:09:57.350 --> 00:09:59.570
and he compares it to the measurements of planet earth.

185
00:09:59.571 --> 00:10:04.010
And what he found is that there's a precise ratio that the great pyramid of Giza

186
00:10:04.440 --> 00:10:09.170
equates to one in 43,200 scale of the

187
00:10:09.330 --> 00:10:12.970
Northern hemisphere. So why does that matter? That's a number what, who cares,

188
00:10:12.971 --> 00:10:17.000
right? It has to be a ratio of something, but that number for, or three, two,

189
00:10:17.001 --> 00:10:17.834
as you see,

190
00:10:18.640 --> 00:10:21.720
just so happens to be shared from other ancient civilizations and cultures

191
00:10:21.721 --> 00:10:23.120
dating back thousands of years,

192
00:10:23.470 --> 00:10:27.440
whether it's the combination of the Sumerian king list or the Kali UGA.

193
00:10:27.820 --> 00:10:31.160
So if the great pyramid of Giza is supposed to represent the Northern

194
00:10:31.161 --> 00:10:31.994
hemisphere,

195
00:10:32.220 --> 00:10:35.480
you may be surprised to know that if you take half the minutes in a day,

196
00:10:35.990 --> 00:10:39.990
that equal was 43,200 seconds. Yet,

197
00:10:40.050 --> 00:10:42.670
if you were to say that, okay, well, if that's half the earth,

198
00:10:42.671 --> 00:10:47.070
what about a full representation, two pyramids, one for the Northern hemisphere,

199
00:10:47.071 --> 00:10:49.870
one for the Southern hemisphere that would equal the shape what's referred to as

200
00:10:49.871 --> 00:10:54.630
an Okta Hedron, which just so happens to equate to 1,440 degrees. Well,

201
00:10:54.631 --> 00:10:57.380
when you look at how many hours there are in an day,

202
00:10:57.381 --> 00:11:01.900
it equates to 1,440 minutes. Let's make a comparison for the sun,

203
00:11:01.960 --> 00:11:04.020
the radius being 430,

204
00:11:04.040 --> 00:11:07.860
2000 miles with the diameter being 864,000 miles.

205
00:11:08.330 --> 00:11:10.700
Look at those numbers, 4, 3, 2, and 8, 6, 4,

206
00:11:11.320 --> 00:11:14.300
and then compare that a full day in time for minutes,

207
00:11:14.660 --> 00:11:19.210
1440 equals 8, 6, 4 for 86,400.

208
00:11:19.740 --> 00:11:22.530
Again, if you look at these zeros, we can easily say,

209
00:11:22.531 --> 00:11:23.410
we're just playing with numbers,

210
00:11:24.190 --> 00:11:26.170
but is it possible that these numbers have some meaning?

211
00:11:26.450 --> 00:11:30.970
Cuz that's not forget that our very system of time and measurement of time

212
00:11:31.550 --> 00:11:36.010
and our calendar is all based off of the size and rotation speed of the earth as

213
00:11:36.011 --> 00:11:37.410
well as our orbit around the sun.

214
00:11:38.360 --> 00:11:39.840
So when I mentioned earlier with the Sumerians,

215
00:11:39.841 --> 00:11:42.640
one of the earliest pieces of documentation, of any kind,

216
00:11:43.110 --> 00:11:47.880
they somehow knew about the solar system and they're also the creators of the

217
00:11:47.881 --> 00:11:50.480
modern calendar and system of time that we use today.

218
00:11:50.780 --> 00:11:54.160
And it's a complete mystery on how they figured this out because you have to

219
00:11:54.161 --> 00:11:58.200
know specific information of the cosmos to figure that out these numbers,

220
00:11:58.201 --> 00:12:00.880
aren't an accident for how many minutes and seconds and hours there are.

221
00:12:01.100 --> 00:12:03.760
But when you just look at that number 4, 3, 2,

222
00:12:04.040 --> 00:12:07.200
and how it connects to other civilizations from across the world,

223
00:12:07.201 --> 00:12:10.200
dating back thousands of years, is it just an accident,

224
00:12:10.550 --> 00:12:15.150
combine that with Ola test stating that define the secrets of the universe,

225
00:12:15.151 --> 00:12:18.750
you must think in terms of energy, frequency and vibration, just think about it.

226
00:12:19.360 --> 00:12:23.270
Atoms that were made up of RA frequency, whether we're talking your wifi,

227
00:12:23.700 --> 00:12:25.430
your TV channel, your radio station,

228
00:12:25.720 --> 00:12:28.230
everything operates on a completely different frequency.

229
00:12:28.340 --> 00:12:30.830
Just think about these things we take for granted, even a microwave.

230
00:12:31.170 --> 00:12:35.340
It heats up your food through waves, a very specific frequency,

231
00:12:35.570 --> 00:12:37.620
even consider radioactive material,

232
00:12:37.621 --> 00:12:40.940
which many consider to be the source of energy and heat inside of planet earth.

233
00:12:41.400 --> 00:12:43.820
The name itself, radio active,

234
00:12:44.090 --> 00:12:47.780
that same material that powers entire cities, nuclear submarines,

235
00:12:47.920 --> 00:12:52.380
and aircraft carriers for decades on end is essentially providing energy.

236
00:12:52.410 --> 00:12:54.610
That is simply in the full of a frequency.

237
00:12:54.870 --> 00:12:57.610
Now consider Ola Tesla's emphasis on numbers.

238
00:12:58.240 --> 00:13:01.890
When you bring back that information to the great pyramid of Giza inside the

239
00:13:01.891 --> 00:13:05.370
King's chamber, that watertight shaft, which was incredible and of itself,

240
00:13:05.750 --> 00:13:10.450
it just so happens to be measured in 8.4 inches by 4.8 8.4 by

241
00:13:10.451 --> 00:13:12.650
4.8 4.8 by 8.4,

242
00:13:13.810 --> 00:13:16.560
consider on just how precise and accurate it is. Is that an accident?

243
00:13:17.030 --> 00:13:20.800
What I'm suggesting here is that these numbers do matter that the gateway to

244
00:13:20.801 --> 00:13:25.320
understanding a frequency of energy giving off from the Earth's crust as Ola was

245
00:13:25.321 --> 00:13:29.480
adamant that he had perfected somewhere lies in ratios and numbers.

246
00:13:29.580 --> 00:13:32.080
And maybe that number 4, 3, 2 is significant.

247
00:13:33.000 --> 00:13:35.310
And going back throughout the internal structure of the great pyramid,

248
00:13:35.740 --> 00:13:38.990
when you look at the grand gallery or another chambers and other pyramids,

249
00:13:39.010 --> 00:13:43.830
the insane sound resonance and acoustic abilities that are just mind boggling,

250
00:13:44.250 --> 00:13:45.510
is that really just an accident?

251
00:13:45.970 --> 00:13:49.990
Is it possible that what we're looking at here is some sort of device that could

252
00:13:49.991 --> 00:13:53.310
harness energy, a frequency that people could tap into for energy,

253
00:13:53.550 --> 00:13:55.580
a source of power. You know,

254
00:13:55.581 --> 00:13:58.340
it's interesting if you go back just a couple hundred years and were to talk

255
00:13:58.341 --> 00:14:01.380
about cell phones and cars and airplanes and whatev wifi,

256
00:14:02.040 --> 00:14:03.340
people would just dismiss it.

257
00:14:03.690 --> 00:14:06.900
What I'm suggesting is that the great pyramid of Giza is over our head.

258
00:14:07.120 --> 00:14:11.100
The most likely situation is that human civilization dates back far older and

259
00:14:11.101 --> 00:14:12.940
was far more advanced than we ever realized.

260
00:14:13.000 --> 00:14:16.090
And they were wiped out a very long time ago. Want this,

261
00:14:16.091 --> 00:14:19.770
explain all the similarities of the ancient civilizations across multiple

262
00:14:19.771 --> 00:14:22.650
continents around the world, such as the use of pyramids,

263
00:14:23.190 --> 00:14:25.690
the incredible similarities of structure and, uh,

264
00:14:25.691 --> 00:14:29.450
stone cutting cultural similarities and gold and funeral masks.

265
00:14:29.800 --> 00:14:33.250
This would explain the massive holes inside the theory of the human migration

266
00:14:33.251 --> 00:14:37.480
process. I mean, why are we finding Aboriginal DNA in south American Mami,

267
00:14:37.481 --> 00:14:38.320
but not north America?

268
00:14:38.630 --> 00:14:41.560
Doesn't that suggest that they just skipped over north America altogether?

269
00:14:41.580 --> 00:14:44.800
How did they get there or the DNA evidence that shows that there is middle

270
00:14:44.801 --> 00:14:48.160
Eastern DNA inside of native Americans? What is that about?

271
00:14:48.180 --> 00:14:50.680
And then we look at other stories popping up this year,

272
00:14:51.520 --> 00:14:56.160
evidence of humans in north America, going back more than 130,000 years ago.

273
00:14:56.160 --> 00:14:58.720
And nobody can explain why the solution is simple.

274
00:14:58.730 --> 00:15:02.360
We're talking about a period of time where humans were once advanced enough to

275
00:15:02.361 --> 00:15:03.194
travel the world.

276
00:15:03.500 --> 00:15:06.360
The evidence has long since gone when you're talking about thousands of years

277
00:15:06.520 --> 00:15:08.720
and I've used this example before, when it comes to the Titanic,

278
00:15:09.070 --> 00:15:11.950
more than 50% gone, I've for just over a hundred years underwater.

279
00:15:12.510 --> 00:15:14.070
And although things ode quicker underwater,

280
00:15:14.220 --> 00:15:18.510
when you look at cars and houses and just how fast they erode did you know that

281
00:15:18.511 --> 00:15:20.870
it's theorized that if every human disappeared off flat earth today,

282
00:15:20.871 --> 00:15:24.390
the longest lasting structure would be the Hoover dam and the estimate that

283
00:15:24.391 --> 00:15:26.350
it'll fall apart in about 10,000 years,

284
00:15:26.930 --> 00:15:30.430
we just seem to take for granted just how long of a period of time thousands and

285
00:15:30.431 --> 00:15:34.420
tens of of years truly is anything that's manmade goes away,

286
00:15:34.440 --> 00:15:37.300
except for things made out of stone like the pyramids or the Finks.

287
00:15:37.520 --> 00:15:41.220
And now that all the evidence shows that whoever was living in Egypt a few

288
00:15:41.340 --> 00:15:43.260
thousand years ago, just could not have done these things.

289
00:15:43.920 --> 00:15:48.620
And the suggestive evidence that there was advanced knowledge of the cosmos as

290
00:15:48.621 --> 00:15:50.380
well as planet earth. When you piece together,

291
00:15:50.440 --> 00:15:53.570
all the things that I've outline this video and you connect the dots,

292
00:15:53.880 --> 00:15:58.210
it's abundantly clear that the true history of ancient human civilization is far

293
00:15:58.211 --> 00:16:00.730
older and was far more advanced than we were taught in school.

294
00:16:01.390 --> 00:16:04.210
And it's time that we start asking new questions because whatever the great

295
00:16:04.211 --> 00:16:07.570
pyramid of Giza was, we need to find out it's clearly important,

296
00:16:08.050 --> 00:16:11.770
whatever it was it's worth knowing about because something happened to ancient

297
00:16:11.970 --> 00:16:13.560
human and civilization to wipe them out.

298
00:16:14.100 --> 00:16:17.160
So maybe we have something to learn from the past. So I'll wrap it up there.

299
00:16:17.540 --> 00:16:19.960
I'm Jimmy, this is bright insight. I can subscribe. Leave me a comment.

300
00:16:19.980 --> 00:16:21.000
Let me know what your thoughts are.

301
00:16:21.380 --> 00:16:24.640
And I have many other videos coming and whole wide variety topics, soon daycare.
