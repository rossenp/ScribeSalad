1
00:00:02.750 --> 00:00:06.410
<v 0>So there is a serious problem going on within our scientific community.</v>

2
00:00:06.920 --> 00:00:09.850
Take for example, Ang Pang located in Indonesia,

3
00:00:10.310 --> 00:00:15.210
the world's oldest pyramid that almost nobody has ever heard of. In fact,

4
00:00:15.230 --> 00:00:17.530
it dates back more than 25,000 years,

5
00:00:17.990 --> 00:00:21.690
and there is still a chamber 50 feet down that has not been excavated.

6
00:00:22.820 --> 00:00:26.800
One can only imagine why more than 34 professional

7
00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:31.920
scientists have literally campaigned to prevent this site from being

8
00:00:32.030 --> 00:00:32.863
excavated.

9
00:00:33.060 --> 00:00:37.080
And you wanna know why to protect their own grant funding because grant funding

10
00:00:37.660 --> 00:00:42.440
equals a paycheck. You know, guys just like politics, the government,

11
00:00:42.620 --> 00:00:45.230
the news, new media, we've all seen in the last few years,

12
00:00:45.231 --> 00:00:49.830
just how corrupt things truly are and how money focused our world society has

13
00:00:49.831 --> 00:00:50.111
become.

14
00:00:50.111 --> 00:00:53.590
And unfortunately it has made its way into the mainstream scientific community.

15
00:00:53.650 --> 00:00:55.430
In fact, this happened a very long time ago,

16
00:00:55.820 --> 00:00:57.750
just that most people weren't aware of it.

17
00:00:58.290 --> 00:01:01.790
Now let me share with you a little bit of information about this site UNG put

18
00:01:01.950 --> 00:01:05.300
on. It's also just known as omega thick sight. It's not a traditional pyramid,

19
00:01:05.410 --> 00:01:09.580
like you'll find in Egypt or meso America, it was carved out of a mountain.

20
00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:10.581
In fact,

21
00:01:10.581 --> 00:01:13.100
you can see some of these illustrations here to get you a feel for what they

22
00:01:13.101 --> 00:01:17.380
believe it looks like. And it utilizes natural stone blocks, basalt,

23
00:01:17.980 --> 00:01:21.380
volcanic rock that is essentially hexagonal shape. I mean,

24
00:01:21.381 --> 00:01:23.860
this is the same phenomena that we've seen elsewhere in the world.

25
00:01:24.470 --> 00:01:27.450
You may be familiar with. What's called giants Causeway in Ireland,

26
00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:30.730
that many people thought was a megalithic site. Uh,

27
00:01:30.731 --> 00:01:33.530
but after listening to Dr. Robert shock, explain this. I mean,

28
00:01:33.531 --> 00:01:36.130
we've seen this elsewhere throughout the world, numerous sites,

29
00:01:36.310 --> 00:01:40.330
and it's just a natural phenomena and the people that live there or that built

30
00:01:40.331 --> 00:01:42.810
this megalithic site. And I can show you more details in just a second,

31
00:01:43.850 --> 00:01:46.520
utilize these stones. But speaking of Dr. Robert shock,

32
00:01:46.660 --> 00:01:51.040
who got his masters and PhD in geology from Yale or Dr.

33
00:01:51.050 --> 00:01:55.840
Danny Hillman, who got his doctorate in geology from Caltech guys,

34
00:01:55.930 --> 00:01:58.560
these people have visited the site conducted excavations.

35
00:01:58.910 --> 00:02:02.400
They've proven that this site is incredible,

36
00:02:02.401 --> 00:02:04.200
that it's not natural in itself.

37
00:02:04.220 --> 00:02:09.030
It is literally a megalithic site that has been built upon itself over tens of

38
00:02:09.150 --> 00:02:09.983
thousands of years,

39
00:02:10.140 --> 00:02:13.110
because through evidence obtained through two different core samples,

40
00:02:13.240 --> 00:02:17.750
which identified at least seven items that dated back more than 25,000 years,

41
00:02:18.250 --> 00:02:21.870
am I the only one that's just completely disturbed about the fact that 50 feet

42
00:02:21.871 --> 00:02:25.470
down, there's some sort of chamber possibly carved out of a lava flow,

43
00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:27.260
but there's a large structure.

44
00:02:27.261 --> 00:02:31.580
That's artificial something manmade 50 feet down never been seen before.

45
00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:33.140
We don't know what's in it.

46
00:02:33.740 --> 00:02:37.380
And that there's been almost three dozen scientists that have tried to stop us

47
00:02:37.381 --> 00:02:39.860
from finding out, I mean, that is fricking disturbing. Now,

48
00:02:39.861 --> 00:02:41.020
as you look at these photographs here,

49
00:02:41.021 --> 00:02:44.220
it's easy to understand that some people may have thought as they did that.

50
00:02:44.221 --> 00:02:46.850
It was just a natural site and it wasn't man whatsoever.

51
00:02:47.110 --> 00:02:49.570
Of course the drill samples prove that the deeper they go,

52
00:02:49.571 --> 00:02:53.530
the older it gets and it goes back at least 5,000 years. Well at the surface,

53
00:02:54.030 --> 00:02:56.010
and it goes down to 12,500 years,

54
00:02:56.030 --> 00:03:00.480
20,000 or 22,000 years to 25,000 years. Again, the deeper, the go,

55
00:03:00.481 --> 00:03:03.560
the older it gets now to kind of give you a picture of what this may have looked

56
00:03:03.561 --> 00:03:06.560
like. If you go to nearby PPE. When I see nearby,

57
00:03:06.561 --> 00:03:09.520
it's actually a few thousand miles away, I guess it's in the same region,

58
00:03:09.620 --> 00:03:11.160
but it's an island. It's pretty incredible.

59
00:03:11.260 --> 00:03:14.240
But when you look at these stone walls here, same exact thing,

60
00:03:14.330 --> 00:03:17.320
these volcanic rocks, same shape, and these stack on each other.

61
00:03:17.460 --> 00:03:20.350
And that's what we're looking at at here over at Guang Padang.

62
00:03:20.690 --> 00:03:23.270
And it's also worth mentioning that if you go halfway across the world,

63
00:03:23.390 --> 00:03:27.750
D Machu Pichu in south America, you find these level terraces of stone walls.

64
00:03:28.090 --> 00:03:29.470
And it's the same thing that they're finding,

65
00:03:29.530 --> 00:03:32.550
or at least similarities of to that of gun, uh, Guang Padang.

66
00:03:32.770 --> 00:03:35.670
But of course the big mystery is about this underground chamber,

67
00:03:35.860 --> 00:03:39.820
15 meters down about 50 feet. They've identified it it through, like I said,

68
00:03:39.840 --> 00:03:43.500
two core drill samples, as well as ground penetrating radar. You know,

69
00:03:43.501 --> 00:03:47.620
like you've seen from jurasic park and this technology has developed

70
00:03:47.621 --> 00:03:50.740
significantly and they use it in so many different ways throughout the world,

71
00:03:50.741 --> 00:03:54.180
whether it's in industry, whether it's just doing maintenance and utilities,

72
00:03:54.480 --> 00:03:57.020
and it's helped archeologists find dinosaur bones,

73
00:03:57.050 --> 00:04:01.010
it's helped civil engineers fix city problems and so many other things.

74
00:04:01.270 --> 00:04:03.250
And since I'm discussing ground penetrating radar,

75
00:04:03.590 --> 00:04:06.130
as well as corruption within the scientific community,

76
00:04:06.770 --> 00:04:11.210
I have to discuss Dr. Zahi HOAs, who is the minister of antiquities for Egypt,

77
00:04:11.330 --> 00:04:15.090
a government position, a politician assigned by the president of Egypt.

78
00:04:15.720 --> 00:04:17.650
This guy I have to tell you,

79
00:04:17.880 --> 00:04:21.080
because I have received so many comments about him in all my videos about

80
00:04:21.081 --> 00:04:24.840
ancient Egypt, that this guy's a total liar, he's a total fraud.

81
00:04:24.860 --> 00:04:27.400
And I know that that sounds kind of extreme, but you know,

82
00:04:27.401 --> 00:04:30.600
I've heard so many other people say it and upon doing research on my own,

83
00:04:30.780 --> 00:04:31.760
oh my God.

84
00:04:31.980 --> 00:04:35.560
And I have to bring it up because this guy is considered by many and by himself

85
00:04:35.561 --> 00:04:38.160
included the world's most famous archeologist.

86
00:04:38.510 --> 00:04:41.350
He's also been referred to as the himself.

87
00:04:41.420 --> 00:04:45.190
This guy has given tours throughout Egypt to leaders throughout the world.

88
00:04:45.580 --> 00:04:46.380
He's written books,

89
00:04:46.380 --> 00:04:51.310
he's made a ton of money and he has also denied numerous examples of the most

90
00:04:51.311 --> 00:04:55.230
recent scientific data that has presented itself or the presented the scientific

91
00:04:55.231 --> 00:04:59.390
community, such as the true age of the S Finks. In fact, I highly recommend,

92
00:04:59.391 --> 00:05:02.500
and I'll include a link to where you watch a debate between him and Graham

93
00:05:02.501 --> 00:05:07.140
Hancock, uh, where he completely denies the use of ground penetrating radar.

94
00:05:07.330 --> 00:05:10.620
He's denied the age of the spanks and refused to even discuss it.

95
00:05:10.650 --> 00:05:15.300
He's denied go Beckley Tepe, which is dated at 11,600 years ago.

96
00:05:15.301 --> 00:05:17.220
You've heard me talk about it in this guy.

97
00:05:17.280 --> 00:05:22.010
The way he's responded to any new information has been extreme. I mean,

98
00:05:22.011 --> 00:05:24.770
this guy has walked out on people. He's been incredibly disrespectful.

99
00:05:25.200 --> 00:05:27.370
He's included people of being liars and thieves,

100
00:05:27.371 --> 00:05:30.250
which is a really interesting thing for him to say, because if you're not aware,

101
00:05:30.670 --> 00:05:33.370
he was accused of stealing artifacts from the great pyramid itself.

102
00:05:33.870 --> 00:05:37.010
He denied it. He lied his way out of it. There's a lot of information there.

103
00:05:37.011 --> 00:05:38.370
A few people went to jail over it.

104
00:05:38.640 --> 00:05:40.970
They say that he was the reason why they were able to do it.

105
00:05:41.630 --> 00:05:42.720
He got with it guys,

106
00:05:42.900 --> 00:05:46.520
and this was all after the fact that he had got fired from his position itself.

107
00:05:46.540 --> 00:05:48.680
So I guess that's good news all the way around. And let me just say,

108
00:05:48.681 --> 00:05:50.400
because this is actually a negative message.

109
00:05:51.040 --> 00:05:53.480
Let me say something good about him on live TV.

110
00:05:53.620 --> 00:05:57.840
He acknowledged that the 100 ton stone boxes located at the Sarah PMM.

111
00:05:57.841 --> 00:06:00.760
I've mentioned this in multiple videos, which are a complete mystery.

112
00:06:00.780 --> 00:06:03.800
He himself has acknowledged that they have no idea how they did this.

113
00:06:04.060 --> 00:06:06.000
He has no idea how they fit him into the nooks,

114
00:06:06.001 --> 00:06:07.600
which at least one example of it,

115
00:06:07.601 --> 00:06:09.800
it's impossible to move it in and out of the nook itself.

116
00:06:10.020 --> 00:06:13.400
And the fact that they're machined down to, within a level of accuracy of two,

117
00:06:13.540 --> 00:06:15.120
10 thousands of an inch. And yes,

118
00:06:15.121 --> 00:06:18.550
that is an example of lost and high technology of some kind. Uh,

119
00:06:18.551 --> 00:06:22.230
but I'll leave it at that. But I digress and going back to Graham Hancock and,

120
00:06:22.430 --> 00:06:23.263
uh, Ang Padang,

121
00:06:23.310 --> 00:06:27.190
I would never even have heard of this site if it wasn't for the Joe Rogan

122
00:06:27.191 --> 00:06:28.390
podcast with Graham Hancock,

123
00:06:28.391 --> 00:06:31.430
where they discuss it and where it stands now is that they're supposed to start

124
00:06:31.431 --> 00:06:32.390
excavations back up.

125
00:06:32.391 --> 00:06:35.990
It had been delayed by a couple years for what I understand and because of all

126
00:06:35.991 --> 00:06:39.580
the political drama, and once Indonesia got a new president, uh,

127
00:06:39.840 --> 00:06:42.100
he was presented the information, the evidence and said, yeah,

128
00:06:42.101 --> 00:06:44.500
let's get this going again. In fact, they're gonna increase tours.

129
00:06:44.501 --> 00:06:46.300
They're gonna have a whole train system set up.

130
00:06:46.440 --> 00:06:49.740
So the country can have people see this site more often. And again,

131
00:06:49.741 --> 00:06:52.420
they're gonna continue their excavations and waiting on more information.

132
00:06:52.600 --> 00:06:56.180
And this site being at least 12,500, according to the mainstream,

133
00:06:56.530 --> 00:07:01.090
even though there's enough data that they use to show that it's more than 25,000

134
00:07:01.091 --> 00:07:01.924
years old,

135
00:07:02.600 --> 00:07:05.450
they at least acknowledge that it's one of the oldest sites on earth and the

136
00:07:05.451 --> 00:07:07.890
fact that most people haven't even heard of it. And again, you know,

137
00:07:07.891 --> 00:07:10.530
you could look at this thing like, well, I'm not sure how impressive it it is,

138
00:07:10.550 --> 00:07:13.490
but guys, there's a chamber 50 feet down and who knows what's in it.

139
00:07:13.700 --> 00:07:14.171
We're talking,

140
00:07:14.171 --> 00:07:17.850
going back to the beginning of the last ice age at 26,000 years ago.

141
00:07:18.580 --> 00:07:21.920
So this site is unbelievably interesting, Dr. Robert shock,

142
00:07:21.940 --> 00:07:23.480
who I highly recommend you look into,

143
00:07:23.481 --> 00:07:26.760
he discusses it in detail and all the overwhelming evidence of that.

144
00:07:26.761 --> 00:07:27.550
This isn't natural,

145
00:07:27.550 --> 00:07:31.760
that this you can see and he outlines it in great detail of all the evidence

146
00:07:31.761 --> 00:07:33.640
that this was a very sophisticated site.

147
00:07:33.641 --> 00:07:37.960
And what you're looking at here is something that has deteriorated over tens of

148
00:07:38.120 --> 00:07:40.830
thousands of years. Anyways, guys, I'll keep you posted.

149
00:07:40.860 --> 00:07:42.670
When more information comes to light about this,

150
00:07:42.790 --> 00:07:46.190
I highly recommend you check out Graham hancock.com as he's been given updates

151
00:07:46.191 --> 00:07:47.510
about this, but it's been a little while.

152
00:07:47.570 --> 00:07:49.830
So hopefully some new information will be coming around soon,

153
00:07:50.250 --> 00:07:52.750
and I'll be making a full-fledged video at some point in the future.

154
00:07:53.380 --> 00:07:57.990
Outlining all the examples that show that the mainstream scientific community is

155
00:07:58.100 --> 00:08:01.700
literally it ignoring the most recent data guys. This is not,

156
00:08:01.701 --> 00:08:04.980
what's supposed to be happening. We're seeing that people with egos,

157
00:08:05.160 --> 00:08:09.340
people that don't wanna be wrong. People that wanna protect their paychecks,

158
00:08:10.210 --> 00:08:11.340
they are running the show.

159
00:08:11.600 --> 00:08:15.180
And the implications of the fact that the true history of ancient human

160
00:08:15.181 --> 00:08:16.380
civilization is far older.

161
00:08:16.480 --> 00:08:18.260
And with far more advanced than we're ever taught in school,

162
00:08:18.520 --> 00:08:22.450
the implications are significant because whatever happened to that civilization

163
00:08:22.451 --> 00:08:25.050
that made it just get wiped out will eventually happen again.

164
00:08:25.070 --> 00:08:26.530
And if when you control the past,

165
00:08:26.870 --> 00:08:28.890
you control the present and the future as well.

166
00:08:29.110 --> 00:08:32.570
And we need to learn from the past and at minimum, it's incredibly interesting.

167
00:08:32.590 --> 00:08:34.250
So I'll leave it at that. Leave me a comment.

168
00:08:34.270 --> 00:08:37.170
Let me know what your thoughts are, but I'm Jimmy. This is bright insight,

169
00:08:37.171 --> 00:08:39.930
and I got many more videos to come and a whole wide variety of topics.

170
00:08:40.550 --> 00:08:41.360
Take care, everybody.
