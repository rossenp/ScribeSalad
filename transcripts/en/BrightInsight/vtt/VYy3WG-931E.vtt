00:00:00.840 --> 00:00:05.500
<v 0>For the first time ever liquid water has been discovered on Mars and the</v>

2
00:00:05.780 --> 00:00:10.460
significance of this discovery cannot be overstated as it virtually guarantees

3
00:00:10.461 --> 00:00:13.260
that life does indeed exist on Mars today,

4
00:00:13.640 --> 00:00:17.700
at least in some form based on everything that we currently know about the

5
00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:21.610
building blocks for life, because after all, we, there is water.

6
00:00:21.820 --> 00:00:24.170
There is life. And in this video,

7
00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:28.850
I'm gonna discuss key details about this discovery and then connect the dots and

8
00:00:28.851 --> 00:00:33.250
other really interesting pieces of information about Mars that most people are

9
00:00:33.251 --> 00:00:34.084
just not aware of.

10
00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:38.690
This discovery comes at the same time as a global sandstorm that has engulfed

11
00:00:38.691 --> 00:00:43.120
the entire planet, which I'll be discussing late in this video. But first,

12
00:00:43.660 --> 00:00:47.040
let me start by discussing the details of the liquid water discovery,

13
00:00:47.170 --> 00:00:51.360
which is in the form of a massive underground subglacial lake

14
00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:55.960
located at the south pole of Mars. And if your first thought is, wait,

15
00:00:56.150 --> 00:00:59.360
this is an underground lake located beneath a glacier.

16
00:01:00.140 --> 00:01:04.470
Why should we even assume that the possibility of life would exist there? Well,

17
00:01:04.471 --> 00:01:09.270
we must first remind ourselves of the 2014 discovery at lake VO talk in

18
00:01:09.271 --> 00:01:13.670
Antarctica where scientists were shocked to find microbial life thriving,

19
00:01:14.150 --> 00:01:16.230
a half mile below the Antarctic ice sheet.

20
00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:19.430
So compare that to the recent discovery on Mars,

21
00:01:19.431 --> 00:01:22.070
which is estimated to be one and a half kilometers,

22
00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:25.860
just under one mile beneath Mars's polar ice cap.

23
00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:30.300
And this data was collected through a scientific study by Italian researchers

24
00:01:30.770 --> 00:01:34.020
that was conducted between 2012 and 2015,

25
00:01:34.430 --> 00:01:38.020
where they utilized satellite data from 29 radar pulses,

26
00:01:38.510 --> 00:01:43.410
which indicated a body of water possibly in aquifer or a reservoir underneath

27
00:01:43.411 --> 00:01:45.530
the ice and this body of water,

28
00:01:45.540 --> 00:01:50.250
which is thought to be salt water based on the fact that it is not frozen is 20

29
00:01:50.251 --> 00:01:53.730
kilometers wide or roughly 12 and a half miles wide.

30
00:01:54.490 --> 00:01:57.810
And right now you're probably wondering how they can identify a body of water

31
00:01:57.811 --> 00:02:02.450
that is one mile beneath ice, all from a satellite that is orbiting a planet.

32
00:02:03.470 --> 00:02:04.000
Well,

33
00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:08.320
apparently there's something called the Mars advanced radar for subsurface and

34
00:02:08.830 --> 00:02:12.800
IERE sounding instrument, which is fixed on the European space.

35
00:02:13.480 --> 00:02:18.040
Agency's Mars express spacecraft, which essentially bounces low frequency,

36
00:02:18.041 --> 00:02:22.080
radar ways back and forth and identifies changes in signal. You know,

37
00:02:22.100 --> 00:02:25.550
I'm not gonna pretend that I fully on understand how this technology works,

38
00:02:26.050 --> 00:02:30.190
but it's almost as if we've already created star Trek type technology,

39
00:02:30.680 --> 00:02:34.710
where we use some type of gadget to search for lifeforms or whatever from a

40
00:02:34.910 --> 00:02:37.550
distance. And of course I'm being humorous here,

41
00:02:37.570 --> 00:02:42.070
but I could see how many people would doubt our technological capabilities to

42
00:02:42.071 --> 00:02:44.150
know all of this information about Mars.

43
00:02:44.480 --> 00:02:47.180
Having never stepped foot on there to verify it,

44
00:02:47.181 --> 00:02:51.500
getting back to the significance of this discovery, there's water on Mars.

45
00:02:51.520 --> 00:02:53.700
So how can there not be life there?

46
00:02:54.490 --> 00:02:57.460
Some people will mention the higher levels of radiation on Mars,

47
00:02:57.461 --> 00:03:01.520
which of course is an obstacle for humans in our attempts to travel to Mars

48
00:03:01.521 --> 00:03:01.940
safely.

49
00:03:01.940 --> 00:03:06.400
But let's not forget that we've discovered certain bacteria that literally

50
00:03:06.510 --> 00:03:09.400
develop and thrive inside of nuclear reactors,

51
00:03:09.401 --> 00:03:14.040
which of course was another stunning discovery by scientists some years ago.

52
00:03:14.540 --> 00:03:18.440
But another indicator that life already exists on Mars involves the changing low

53
00:03:18.510 --> 00:03:21.910
levels of methane emitting into space from the red planet,

54
00:03:21.960 --> 00:03:25.190
which even varies between seasons. Now,

55
00:03:25.420 --> 00:03:29.270
methane is not necessarily evidence of the existence of life on Mars,

56
00:03:29.330 --> 00:03:33.430
but it is an indicator that some sort of organic matter may indeed exist

57
00:03:33.580 --> 00:03:34.790
currently on the planet.

58
00:03:35.450 --> 00:03:38.590
Now let's be real many people myself included,

59
00:03:39.020 --> 00:03:42.580
already believed that life once thrived on Mars at some point in the distant

60
00:03:42.770 --> 00:03:45.860
past. And there really is little reason to doubt this,

61
00:03:46.140 --> 00:03:50.580
considering that there is empirical evidence of ancient lakes, oceans, rivers,

62
00:03:50.600 --> 00:03:54.900
and water channels existing throughout the surface of Mars. In fact,

63
00:03:55.180 --> 00:03:59.220
scientists state that it was likely three to 4 billion years ago when life was

64
00:03:59.530 --> 00:04:00.610
habitable on Mars,

65
00:04:00.611 --> 00:04:04.650
which is an interesting claim considering that we haven't even stepped foot on

66
00:04:04.670 --> 00:04:05.503
the planet.

67
00:04:05.510 --> 00:04:09.810
And we really don't even know what the surface of earth was like even just 1

68
00:04:09.810 --> 00:04:12.850
billion years ago. I mean, some 300 million years ago,

69
00:04:12.851 --> 00:04:15.010
there was the super continent of pan GIA,

70
00:04:15.011 --> 00:04:19.170
which they say broke apart about 175 million years ago.

71
00:04:19.270 --> 00:04:24.120
But there also a super continent before pan GIA called Rodinia that they

72
00:04:24.121 --> 00:04:27.080
say broke apart approximately 700 million years ago.

73
00:04:27.940 --> 00:04:32.160
And I'm sure that scientists are both right and wrong about different aspects of

74
00:04:32.180 --> 00:04:35.440
the previous super continents, particularly when they existed.

75
00:04:35.500 --> 00:04:37.440
But the point is that according to them,

76
00:04:37.620 --> 00:04:42.590
all of this is less than 1 billion years ago. Think about that seriously.

77
00:04:42.591 --> 00:04:46.070
We have no clue what was happening here on earth a billion years ago.

78
00:04:46.530 --> 00:04:48.590
And we can't say with any type of certainty,

79
00:04:48.591 --> 00:04:53.470
what Mars was like 1 billion years ago, much less three to 4 billion years ago.

80
00:04:54.330 --> 00:04:56.470
Now hold that thought and think about this.

81
00:04:57.210 --> 00:05:00.990
You may be aware that there was currently an ongoing global sandstorms

82
00:05:01.340 --> 00:05:03.100
surrounding the entire planet of Mars,

83
00:05:03.101 --> 00:05:07.900
which started on May 30th and is expected to last for months based on

84
00:05:07.901 --> 00:05:09.020
past observations.

85
00:05:09.520 --> 00:05:13.260
And here you can see a comparison of right before the storm and how over the

86
00:05:13.261 --> 00:05:15.380
course of three weeks, it completely engulfed the planet.

87
00:05:16.270 --> 00:05:19.820
These storms seem to happen once every five and a half years or so.

88
00:05:20.320 --> 00:05:24.770
And here's actually another of a storm that lasted for four months back in 2001,

89
00:05:25.350 --> 00:05:26.450
but there are of course,

90
00:05:26.451 --> 00:05:30.570
other examples of massive dust storms on Mars that may not engulf the entire

91
00:05:30.571 --> 00:05:33.250
planet, but rather a large portion of it.

92
00:05:33.251 --> 00:05:35.530
And here you can see an example from 2005.

93
00:05:36.070 --> 00:05:39.130
So I'm about to reiterate a point that have made in multiple other videos

94
00:05:39.280 --> 00:05:44.200
involving the evidence of ancient rivers and water channels on the surface of

95
00:05:44.310 --> 00:05:46.640
Mars. So if you've seen all my other videos,

96
00:05:46.670 --> 00:05:51.400
bear with me for a moment while I repeat myself as I just can't discuss Mars

97
00:05:51.401 --> 00:05:54.320
without making more people aware of this important detail,

98
00:05:54.890 --> 00:05:58.400
which is that how can scientists state what the surface of Mars was like three

99
00:05:58.401 --> 00:06:01.880
to 4 billion years ago when there are routine stand storms,

100
00:06:02.400 --> 00:06:05.240
constantly changing the surface of Mars. I mean,

101
00:06:05.310 --> 00:06:09.280
they give examples of a supposed massive flood that happened on Mars 3 billion

102
00:06:09.281 --> 00:06:14.120
years ago, yet virtually the entire surface of Mars is covered with,

103
00:06:14.400 --> 00:06:17.430
with the remnants of ancient lakes river and water channels.

104
00:06:17.490 --> 00:06:22.190
So the question is why haven't 3 billion years of global sandstorms not

105
00:06:22.310 --> 00:06:23.143
eroded these away?

106
00:06:23.650 --> 00:06:27.830
Is it possible that the surface of Mars had water perhaps just thousands of

107
00:06:27.831 --> 00:06:31.350
years ago? Like I said, I've made this point in other videos.

108
00:06:31.410 --> 00:06:34.950
And the most common response that I get is related to the atmosphere on Mars

109
00:06:34.951 --> 00:06:38.700
being only 1% the D E compared to Earth's atmosphere.

110
00:06:39.280 --> 00:06:42.420
And they go on to mention how the strength of the sand storms on Mars are not

111
00:06:42.421 --> 00:06:46.100
nearly as strong as depicted in movies. Take the example of the movie,

112
00:06:46.120 --> 00:06:47.420
the Martian with Matt Damon,

113
00:06:47.470 --> 00:06:51.660
which shows a storm blowing with hurricane force strength. When in reality,

114
00:06:51.680 --> 00:06:56.220
the strongest winds on Mars are limited to about 70 miles an hour due to the

115
00:06:56.221 --> 00:06:57.420
lower atmospheric density,

116
00:06:57.910 --> 00:07:02.450
but scientists themselves state that the sand particles would still be moving at

117
00:07:02.451 --> 00:07:03.530
70 miles an hour.

118
00:07:03.680 --> 00:07:07.730
Even if the wind itself didn't actually feel as strong as it would here on

119
00:07:07.731 --> 00:07:09.930
earth. So although yes,

120
00:07:10.000 --> 00:07:14.250
erosion on Mars occurs much slower than here on earth. It doesn't change.

121
00:07:14.310 --> 00:07:18.760
The fact that Mars still has an atmosphere it's thick enough to be observable

122
00:07:18.761 --> 00:07:19.594
from space,

123
00:07:20.020 --> 00:07:23.920
and it is still dense enough for these dust storms to have sustained winds of 70

124
00:07:23.921 --> 00:07:27.480
miles an hour that engulfed the entire planet for months on end.

125
00:07:28.180 --> 00:07:29.960
So of course that would cause erosion,

126
00:07:30.380 --> 00:07:34.600
all that sand moving in and out of the ancient river beds should have eroded the

127
00:07:34.601 --> 00:07:37.960
sides away into oblivion billions of years ago.

128
00:07:38.930 --> 00:07:42.430
So that is why this particular detail of the existing river beds and water

129
00:07:42.431 --> 00:07:46.510
channels is so important when considering the possibility that Mars may have

130
00:07:46.511 --> 00:07:50.830
been habitable far more recently than scientists suggest. And by the way,

131
00:07:50.900 --> 00:07:52.630
it's not just sandstorms on Mars,

132
00:07:53.130 --> 00:07:57.270
but Mars also has literally millions of dust devils every single day.

133
00:07:57.410 --> 00:07:58.790
And some of them are massive.

134
00:07:59.130 --> 00:08:03.580
They've even observed one that was 12 miles high or 20 kilometers,

135
00:08:03.990 --> 00:08:08.700
which is 10 times larger than the largest tornadoes ever observed here on

136
00:08:08.701 --> 00:08:10.620
earth. Just not as strong,

137
00:08:11.080 --> 00:08:14.340
but if you're still not convinced you should then consider the Phoenix Rover.

138
00:08:14.520 --> 00:08:18.340
And the fact that it took less than a decade to be almost completely buried by

139
00:08:18.341 --> 00:08:21.690
the stands of Mars. And this was reported just a few months ago,

140
00:08:22.070 --> 00:08:24.370
and you can see photos here of the before and after.

141
00:08:24.710 --> 00:08:28.530
And I'm willing to bet that after this current global sandstorm dissipates,

142
00:08:29.040 --> 00:08:31.730
this site will be completely buried in non-existent.

143
00:08:32.350 --> 00:08:36.010
I'd also like to see before and after photos of the various river beds located

144
00:08:36.011 --> 00:08:40.600
throughout Mars to document just how much they changed by this one storm alone.

145
00:08:40.950 --> 00:08:44.960
Everybody should demand to see what the data shows on that. So, yeah,

146
00:08:45.180 --> 00:08:46.200
I'm not afraid to say it.

147
00:08:46.520 --> 00:08:50.240
I strongly believe that the surface of Mars was significantly different,

148
00:08:50.700 --> 00:08:53.800
far more recently than three to 4 billion years ago. In fact,

149
00:08:54.280 --> 00:08:57.360
probably far more recently than even three to 4 million years ago,

150
00:08:57.750 --> 00:09:01.760
that aside we have to wonder what type of life could exist on Mars today.

151
00:09:02.440 --> 00:09:06.840
I bet all my money that at a minimum microbial life exists in the body of water

152
00:09:06.841 --> 00:09:08.040
that was just discovered,

153
00:09:08.660 --> 00:09:11.320
but could there be small fish or crus stations there as well?

154
00:09:11.890 --> 00:09:13.560
Could there be insects around the area?

155
00:09:13.990 --> 00:09:17.350
This actually reminds me of articles that were just published today and going

156
00:09:17.351 --> 00:09:21.550
around the internet regarding the discovery of worms and Siberia that were

157
00:09:21.551 --> 00:09:25.870
brought back to life after being frozen for 42,000 years.

158
00:09:26.590 --> 00:09:27.710
I mean, that's beyond amazing,

159
00:09:27.890 --> 00:09:31.150
and this is actually a real eye opener for what we thought was possible.

160
00:09:31.930 --> 00:09:34.390
And this gets me thinking and makes me wonder what,

161
00:09:34.910 --> 00:09:39.220
what happen if the surface of Mars was to be fertilized with just water alone?

162
00:09:39.890 --> 00:09:43.740
It's been claimed that no organic compounds have been found in Martian soil,

163
00:09:43.840 --> 00:09:46.260
but that of course does not mean that they do not exist.

164
00:09:46.400 --> 00:09:47.860
And even with our rovers,

165
00:09:47.910 --> 00:09:51.620
we've only explored a micro fraction of the Mars surface.

166
00:09:52.250 --> 00:09:53.660
It's also worth mentioning though,

167
00:09:53.661 --> 00:09:57.770
that liquid water has already been governed on Mars as a result of melting ice

168
00:09:57.880 --> 00:10:02.290
caps. But the recent discovery of this massive subglacial lake at the south pole

169
00:10:03.000 --> 00:10:07.490
equates to a persistent body of water that provides the conditions for life for

170
00:10:07.550 --> 00:10:10.610
an extended period of time, not just melting runoff,

171
00:10:11.120 --> 00:10:14.610
thus increasing the probability life has actually developed there.

172
00:10:14.860 --> 00:10:18.720
Ultimately it will not be until we finally step foot on Mars before we get any

173
00:10:18.721 --> 00:10:21.600
real answers as to whether life actually exists there or not.

174
00:10:21.940 --> 00:10:25.960
But before I close this up, it is interesting to point out that today

175
00:10:28.000 --> 00:10:28.270
July 27th, 2018,

176
00:10:28.270 --> 00:10:32.600
just so happens to be the closest approach that Mars and earth have had with

177
00:10:32.601 --> 00:10:35.360
each other in 15 years, since 2003,

178
00:10:35.950 --> 00:10:39.630
this all also actually coincides with today being a full moon,

179
00:10:39.730 --> 00:10:41.110
but not just any full moon,

180
00:10:41.111 --> 00:10:45.550
there's going to be a Lary Clipse and the so-called blood moon will also be

181
00:10:45.750 --> 00:10:46.583
visible this weekend.

182
00:10:46.650 --> 00:10:50.590
So this is definitely a big weekend for astronomers and people that have an

183
00:10:50.750 --> 00:10:53.750
interest in the cosmos. But I'm gonna go ahead and leave it at that.

184
00:10:54.000 --> 00:10:56.790
Leave me a comment and let me know what your thoughts are and about this recent

185
00:10:56.990 --> 00:11:00.340
mark as discovery, as well as the possibility for life existing there.

186
00:11:00.360 --> 00:11:04.180
