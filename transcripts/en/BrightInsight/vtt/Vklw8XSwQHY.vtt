00:00:00.920 --> 00:00:03.340
<v 0>Hey everybody. It's Jimmy with bright insight today,</v>

2
00:00:03.440 --> 00:00:05.700
I'm gonna talk to you about the great Finks and how,

3
00:00:05.701 --> 00:00:09.460
what we were taught in school and what they are still teaching in school today

4
00:00:09.980 --> 00:00:14.980
is inaccurate. Basically, they say that the Finks is 4,500 years old. However,

5
00:00:15.130 --> 00:00:19.460
significant evidence determined by more than 200 professional geologists from

6
00:00:19.461 --> 00:00:23.850
around the world have determined that the encasing of the Finks,

7
00:00:24.350 --> 00:00:28.410
the bedrock limestone has significant evidence of water erosion.

8
00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:30.650
<v 2>Well, why is this important? Well,</v>

9
00:00:30.710 --> 00:00:35.130
the last time that the Nile Delta had significant rainfall was approximately

10
00:00:35.360 --> 00:00:40.130
9,000 years ago. And as you can see here from these photos, yes,

11
00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:43.480
there is evidence of one erosion on the Finks wind. Andand erosion.

12
00:00:43.990 --> 00:00:45.520
This we can see, however,

13
00:00:45.820 --> 00:00:50.560
the enclosure of the Finks itself has absolute definitive evidence of water

14
00:00:50.660 --> 00:00:54.440
and rain, erosion. And guys, the evidence is here for you to see,

15
00:00:54.620 --> 00:00:56.440
and you can make your own judgements yourself.

16
00:00:56.870 --> 00:00:58.800
<v 0>Well, you might be asking why,</v>

17
00:00:58.900 --> 00:01:02.190
if there is evidence that it's far older than what we're being told,

18
00:01:02.410 --> 00:01:05.630
why would it be, uh, why would someone say otherwise, well,

19
00:01:05.631 --> 00:01:07.070
that's a whole other video in itself,

20
00:01:07.071 --> 00:01:10.950
and there is so much evidence and information out there about this subject that

21
00:01:10.951 --> 00:01:13.750
I'm gonna hold off on it. And I wanna just show you in this video,

22
00:01:14.120 --> 00:01:17.550
clear evidence that you can see with your own eyes, that this,

23
00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:19.590
that there is significant water erosion.

24
00:01:20.330 --> 00:01:24.420
So if there's significant water erosion, when could that have happened? Well,

25
00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:28.500
the Nile Delta area has not got more than an inch of rainfall for thousands of

26
00:01:28.501 --> 00:01:29.080
years.

27
00:01:29.080 --> 00:01:33.100
And that there's evidence that the last time that area had significant rainfall

28
00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:35.460
was literally more than 9,000 years ago.

29
00:01:35.620 --> 00:01:39.340
And some sources say even more than that, wake up people that's more than twice.

30
00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:41.540
As old as the swings is being told,

31
00:01:41.680 --> 00:01:45.570
taught in rule date in public and at the university level.

32
00:01:46.120 --> 00:01:47.570
Look at these photos. Look,

33
00:01:47.770 --> 00:01:52.570
I can break it down where you see water erosion and where you see wind erosion.

34
00:01:54.750 --> 00:01:58.840
Look at the comparison here where you can see as it's outlined, and by the way,

35
00:01:58.841 --> 00:02:02.680
thank you for the, I source these photos of Google images. I'm using them for,

36
00:02:03.100 --> 00:02:04.710
you know, education purposes here.

37
00:02:04.711 --> 00:02:06.830
So thank you to everybody who has done the research.

38
00:02:06.940 --> 00:02:10.070
What I'm doing here today is I'm synthesizing and putting together the

39
00:02:10.071 --> 00:02:11.550
information for people to see,

40
00:02:11.580 --> 00:02:16.390
because the information unfolding about the history of human civilization is

41
00:02:16.410 --> 00:02:19.910
far more complicated than what we were taught in school and what is being taught

42
00:02:19.920 --> 00:02:23.470
today. And when you control the past, you control the present and the future.

43
00:02:23.530 --> 00:02:27.060
And that is why they is important. But take a look at these photos here.

44
00:02:27.160 --> 00:02:30.140
You can see clear evidence where I've compared side by side,

45
00:02:30.610 --> 00:02:34.820
wind versus water erosion. Look at these photos,

46
00:02:35.050 --> 00:02:38.820
limestone water erosion, wind erosion.

47
00:02:40.240 --> 00:02:41.940
Here's another picture of more wind erosion.

48
00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:46.650
Now here's a picture of limestone water erosion and compare it next to this

49
00:02:47.090 --> 00:02:50.690
gentleman, uh, that is standing inside with the enclosure of the spanks.

50
00:02:51.350 --> 00:02:52.410
Now look at the next photo.

51
00:02:52.790 --> 00:02:57.610
Two pictures of water erosion and limestone water erosion. There it is.

52
00:02:58.680 --> 00:02:59.513
When you piece it.

53
00:02:59.630 --> 00:03:03.310
<v 1>Together, guys, it's fair to say that it's a twofold answer that yes,</v>

54
00:03:03.311 --> 00:03:06.470
there is some wind erosion and there is rain erosion. However,

55
00:03:06.770 --> 00:03:10.550
if there's rain erosion, as you can clearly see here, and as, as like I said,

56
00:03:10.610 --> 00:03:13.070
200 professional geologists from around the world have stated,

57
00:03:13.660 --> 00:03:14.670
then you have to ask,

58
00:03:14.671 --> 00:03:18.470
start asking yourself some questions like how old is this FIS? Well, guys,

59
00:03:18.870 --> 00:03:23.780
there is significant evidence that human civilization is far older than what

60
00:03:23.781 --> 00:03:27.180
we were ever taught and maybe potentially by tens of thousands of years.

61
00:03:27.770 --> 00:03:31.380
Well guys, I'm Jimmy, this is bright insight. I'm making more videos.

62
00:03:31.381 --> 00:03:34.940
I'm a new channel and there's far more videos to come like and subscribe.

63
00:03:34.941 --> 00:03:38.220
If you like what I have to say and help me spread the message. Be blessed. All.
