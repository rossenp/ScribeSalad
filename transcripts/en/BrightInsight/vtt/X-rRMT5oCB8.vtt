00:00:00.760 --> 00:00:05.160
<v 0>Headlines went around the world about a week ago regarding a newly discovered 30</v>

2
00:00:05.300 --> 00:00:07.160
ton black granite sarcophagus,

3
00:00:07.620 --> 00:00:12.440
the largest ever found in the ancient city of Alexandria, Egypt. Not only that,

4
00:00:12.580 --> 00:00:14.400
but it is sealed shut with thick mortar,

5
00:00:14.650 --> 00:00:19.040
indicating that it has never been open since its burial avoiding grave robbers

6
00:00:19.060 --> 00:00:23.670
for thousands of years is actually a very rare find. Now,

7
00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:27.070
everyone is wondering who or what will they find inside of it.

8
00:00:27.490 --> 00:00:28.323
And in this video,

9
00:00:28.370 --> 00:00:31.710
I'm going to be discussing some really interesting details about this newly

10
00:00:31.910 --> 00:00:35.990
discovered stone box details that were somehow left out of the hundreds of news

11
00:00:35.991 --> 00:00:39.710
articles from around the world on this topic and the implications of these

12
00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:43.140
details, leave us with serious questions that scientists,

13
00:00:43.141 --> 00:00:46.540
archeologists and historians all need to address.

14
00:00:47.040 --> 00:00:51.340
But perhaps more significant is that it was just announced today, July 18th,

15
00:00:51.490 --> 00:00:55.260
that they will be opening this stone box in just two days from today,

16
00:00:56.260 --> 00:01:00.540
quote Egypt's ministry of antiquities has finally decided to open a mysterious

17
00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:04.650
sarcophagus uncovered in Alexandria within the next two days,

18
00:01:04.880 --> 00:01:08.090
according to the head of ministry of antiquities project sector,

19
00:01:09.010 --> 00:01:12.530
it went on to say that they will use thick pipes to raise the sarcophagus lid

20
00:01:12.531 --> 00:01:15.770
until they can see what's inside of it. Once something is found,

21
00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:20.090
a specialized restoration team will immediately take over transferring the

22
00:01:20.091 --> 00:01:24.480
contents into an Alexandria museum storage to quickly start restoration

23
00:01:24.481 --> 00:01:28.320
procedures, quote, if nothing is found inside the sarcophagus.

24
00:01:28.780 --> 00:01:31.640
And we do not find any inscriptions on the Coffin's body,

25
00:01:32.140 --> 00:01:36.360
we will keep it in place until it can be lifted later. So first of all,

26
00:01:36.430 --> 00:01:40.720
everybody needs to demand that the opening of this sarcophagus is done on live

27
00:01:40.780 --> 00:01:44.510
TV or even better yet live streaming on the internet.

28
00:01:44.780 --> 00:01:49.110
They could even do it right here on YouTube and for free make no mistake.

29
00:01:49.510 --> 00:01:52.870
Everyone from around the world has a right to be part of this exciting discovery

30
00:01:52.980 --> 00:01:54.390
involving our ancient past,

31
00:01:54.930 --> 00:01:59.430
but not only that with the numerous examples of corruption and theft involving

32
00:01:59.470 --> 00:02:04.140
Egyptian antiquities in the past full transparency on this is a must.

33
00:02:04.440 --> 00:02:08.100
And I'll be discussing more details about that later in this video. First,

34
00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:12.140
let me share some really interesting aspects about this sarcophagus and the

35
00:02:12.141 --> 00:02:14.860
things that they did not tell you about in the news articles,

36
00:02:15.090 --> 00:02:19.300
including where this black granite originates from which you may find a bit

37
00:02:19.370 --> 00:02:23.260
fascinating. First of all, it's more than 30 metric tons.

38
00:02:23.460 --> 00:02:26.570
And to clarify the difference between a us ton and a metric ton,

39
00:02:26.571 --> 00:02:31.410
because not everybody knows a metric ton is 1000 kilograms and a us ton is

40
00:02:31.430 --> 00:02:33.450
2000 pounds. In other words,

41
00:02:33.600 --> 00:02:38.130
this coffin is estimated to be no less than 66,000

42
00:02:38.230 --> 00:02:39.570
pounds. In fact,

43
00:02:39.571 --> 00:02:44.440
the lit itself is 15 tons and although it is not the largest SAR fagus

44
00:02:44.441 --> 00:02:45.220
ever found,

45
00:02:45.220 --> 00:02:49.760
it is the largest discovered within Alexandria measuring nearly nine feet long,

46
00:02:50.430 --> 00:02:54.080
five and a half feet wide and a staggering six feet tall.

47
00:02:54.500 --> 00:02:56.960
And that equates to 2.7 meters long,

48
00:02:57.020 --> 00:02:59.600
1.5 by 1.8 meters in height.

49
00:03:00.340 --> 00:03:04.160
One thing that is significant besides its size and weight is that it's made of

50
00:03:04.161 --> 00:03:08.360
black granite stone and the closest place where black granite can be found in

51
00:03:08.361 --> 00:03:12.800
the region is either in Aswan, Egypt, which is about 140 miles away,

52
00:03:12.820 --> 00:03:17.680
or 223 kilometers or the mountainous region of Eastern Egypt known

53
00:03:17.700 --> 00:03:18.510
as Sinai,

54
00:03:18.510 --> 00:03:23.310
which is 366 miles or 589 kilometers away.

55
00:03:24.090 --> 00:03:25.070
And just look at the map.

56
00:03:25.250 --> 00:03:28.630
The further distance to Sinai is not as the Crow flies,

57
00:03:28.770 --> 00:03:31.910
but with the distance of the windy roads that go up and down the Sinai

58
00:03:32.350 --> 00:03:32.631
mountains,

59
00:03:32.631 --> 00:03:37.030
which of course begs the question of how they could have and why would they

60
00:03:37.830 --> 00:03:42.060
transport 66,000 pounds of stone up and down mountains?

61
00:03:42.730 --> 00:03:47.580
Obviously the technique suggested by Egyptologists of sliding on wooden sleds or

62
00:03:47.581 --> 00:03:50.780
rolling on tree logs, isn't going to work from this site.

63
00:03:50.800 --> 00:03:54.340
So it's far more likely that it would've come from Awan, which is about,

64
00:03:54.341 --> 00:03:55.980
like I said, 140 miles a away,

65
00:03:56.160 --> 00:04:01.090
but they could utilize barges on the Nile river as by archeologists. But,

66
00:04:01.550 --> 00:04:03.770
and although that's feasible and I don't doubt this method,

67
00:04:04.290 --> 00:04:09.010
I would still like to see them actually demonstrate them load and unload these

68
00:04:09.110 --> 00:04:12.610
two 15 ton pieces of this box onto a boat,

69
00:04:12.790 --> 00:04:16.290
and then unload it all while dealing with the issues of balance and

70
00:04:16.291 --> 00:04:17.410
counterweights. I mean,

71
00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:21.720
this is a theorized method and not necessarily what the ancient Egyptians

72
00:04:22.080 --> 00:04:22.913
actually used,

73
00:04:23.380 --> 00:04:27.360
but that aside what is more interesting is where they found the sarcophagus.

74
00:04:27.900 --> 00:04:32.040
It was discovered by accident during construction of a new building within the

75
00:04:32.041 --> 00:04:36.400
city of Alexandria. And keep in mind that this city is densely populated.

76
00:04:36.830 --> 00:04:40.400
This only further validates that much of the remnants of ancient Egypt is

77
00:04:40.550 --> 00:04:43.030
literally under the streets and houses that exist today.

78
00:04:43.620 --> 00:04:47.390
This is something that I've discussed before and take the example of the massive

79
00:04:47.870 --> 00:04:49.990
statue discovered in March of 2017,

80
00:04:50.560 --> 00:04:54.950
found in the middle of chiro and who knows what else is hidden and buried in the

81
00:04:54.951 --> 00:04:56.790
immediate area around that discovery?

82
00:04:57.500 --> 00:05:00.390
Another good example is the 2017, again,

83
00:05:00.391 --> 00:05:05.140
discovery of a 130,000 year old set of Mastodon bones

84
00:05:05.370 --> 00:05:07.820
that have evidence of human tooling and cut marks,

85
00:05:07.821 --> 00:05:10.500
which proves that ancient humans were in America.

86
00:05:11.050 --> 00:05:15.980
Well over 100,000 years before ever thought possible by academics.

87
00:05:16.240 --> 00:05:19.380
And the implications of this are enormous as it debunks,

88
00:05:19.381 --> 00:05:22.330
what scientists thought they knew about the human mind process.

89
00:05:23.030 --> 00:05:24.690
Now I've discussed that in other videos,

90
00:05:24.691 --> 00:05:28.250
but the reason why I'm bringing it up again is because this discovery happened

91
00:05:28.470 --> 00:05:32.490
by accident while doing construction on a freeway in San Diego, California.

92
00:05:33.150 --> 00:05:37.370
And so when you look at the vastness of the modern city of Giza, as an example,

93
00:05:37.630 --> 00:05:41.330
we can only imagine what lay hidden just meters underneath that city,

94
00:05:41.670 --> 00:05:43.520
but you reemphasize my point.

95
00:05:43.940 --> 00:05:46.880
All of these recent discoveries were found by accident.

96
00:05:47.180 --> 00:05:50.520
So just imagine what we'd find if we actually went looking underneath the modern

97
00:05:50.521 --> 00:05:53.480
infrastructure around ancient sites from around the world.

98
00:05:54.220 --> 00:05:58.120
So going back to the black sarcophagus discovery, and, and that reminds me,

99
00:05:58.121 --> 00:06:02.040
and this, this isn't to sound like a smart or anything, but they are of course,

100
00:06:02.041 --> 00:06:07.000
using heavy machinery to lift this 30 ton stone box out of the 16

101
00:06:07.200 --> 00:06:10.920
and a half foot deep or five meters deep hole where it was found. And it,

102
00:06:10.921 --> 00:06:15.320
it's kind of funny how Egyptologists never actually demonstrate the theorized

103
00:06:15.321 --> 00:06:17.990
lifting techniques the ancients could have used.

104
00:06:18.610 --> 00:06:21.830
And I'm not even suggesting that I doubt these techniques. In fact,

105
00:06:21.950 --> 00:06:24.030
I would bet money that they did use pulleys,

106
00:06:24.090 --> 00:06:28.350
but I feel obligated to point out that most people that teach this and write

107
00:06:28.351 --> 00:06:29.510
about it in textbooks,

108
00:06:30.270 --> 00:06:34.070
actually sit behind desks for a living and never actually try out any of these

109
00:06:34.071 --> 00:06:36.230
theories with their own hands. I mean,

110
00:06:36.231 --> 00:06:40.180
it must be met that these scientists cannot even explain how the ancients

111
00:06:40.460 --> 00:06:43.620
actually cut this granite box with such precision. I mean,

112
00:06:43.621 --> 00:06:47.020
look at the angles on this. And obviously this thing has damage and erosion.

113
00:06:47.800 --> 00:06:51.620
So it will be fascinating to see what the inside stone work looks like once they

114
00:06:51.621 --> 00:06:52.141
open it up,

115
00:06:52.141 --> 00:06:56.220
particularly how level it is and the detailed precision of the angles,

116
00:06:56.800 --> 00:07:01.610
the very of this stone box, particularly the lid is incredibly similar.

117
00:07:02.170 --> 00:07:05.130
Although about two thirds smaller, the size of that,

118
00:07:05.131 --> 00:07:09.730
of the 100 ton stone boxes at the Sierra of Sakara located there,

119
00:07:10.290 --> 00:07:11.130
uh, Memphis, Egypt,

120
00:07:11.270 --> 00:07:16.130
and even Zahi Hawa the disgraced form of minister of

121
00:07:16.690 --> 00:07:18.520
antiquities of Egypt. And in my opinion,

122
00:07:18.800 --> 00:07:23.680
a huge example of why they newly discovered sarcophagus lid should be

123
00:07:23.681 --> 00:07:28.240
opened on live TV is so important, but even this guy admitted on live TV,

124
00:07:28.241 --> 00:07:33.120
that they have no idea how the dynastic Egyptians could have done these and mind

125
00:07:33.121 --> 00:07:35.920
you that they are machined down to two, 10 thousands of an inch.

126
00:07:35.980 --> 00:07:40.510
And the corners are so precise that we can can't do this today without using

127
00:07:40.620 --> 00:07:44.590
routers and diamond bit drills controlled by computers. So,

128
00:07:44.790 --> 00:07:48.110
although these are much larger, in fact, there are 27 of them, by the way.

129
00:07:48.170 --> 00:07:50.870
And some measure as large as 14 feet, high,

130
00:07:51.210 --> 00:07:53.550
10 feet wide and 15 feet long,

131
00:07:54.050 --> 00:07:56.230
and others are smaller and weigh 70 tons.

132
00:07:56.370 --> 00:08:00.980
But regardless these pictures never them justice for just how massive they

133
00:08:00.981 --> 00:08:01.814
really are.

134
00:08:02.160 --> 00:08:05.980
But it's interesting that the shape of the lid is virtually the same with the

135
00:08:05.981 --> 00:08:07.540
three cut angles when you can pair.

136
00:08:08.280 --> 00:08:11.980
But the significance of the comparison is ultimately related to the fact that

137
00:08:11.981 --> 00:08:16.260
this is black granite and bronze tooling that the dynastic Egyptians

138
00:08:16.800 --> 00:08:20.890
had could not have cut through this type of stone with were near this level of

139
00:08:20.891 --> 00:08:25.130
precision. These methods have indeed been tested and they failed miserably.

140
00:08:25.280 --> 00:08:28.930
They can only cut at a rate of a couple millimeters an hour, literally,

141
00:08:29.350 --> 00:08:33.330
and the saws wear out almost immediately. There's no comparison of precision.

142
00:08:33.430 --> 00:08:35.930
And besides that, no saws,

143
00:08:36.000 --> 00:08:40.960
none of this size have ever been found or even depicted in hieroglyphs

144
00:08:40.961 --> 00:08:42.280
left by the ancient Egyptians,

145
00:08:42.830 --> 00:08:46.640
explain how a saw of this size less than a two foot blade. And,

146
00:08:46.800 --> 00:08:48.720
and nevermind the fact that it's made of bronze.

147
00:08:49.420 --> 00:08:53.120
How is this thing going to cut through a stone that is five and a half feet

148
00:08:53.270 --> 00:08:54.103
wide?

149
00:08:54.220 --> 00:08:58.400
The saw you're looking at now is the best and largest found from ancient Egypt.

150
00:08:58.900 --> 00:09:02.880
And the depictions of this saw are detailed by the Egyptians and can be seen

151
00:09:03.310 --> 00:09:05.160
only being used to cut wood. Actually,

152
00:09:05.550 --> 00:09:09.160
it's ridiculous to suggest that bronze would've been used to cut through granite

153
00:09:09.180 --> 00:09:13.440
and it's ridiculous for scientists to sketch up images of massive bronze saws,

154
00:09:13.810 --> 00:09:17.070
which there's no evidence to suggest that they even existed in the first place.

155
00:09:17.210 --> 00:09:21.510
And again, when they made one and tested it anyways, it failed yet,

156
00:09:21.511 --> 00:09:23.950
they still teach these methods in school today.

157
00:09:24.370 --> 00:09:27.990
You see it's important to understand this because it's called science &lt;laugh&gt;

158
00:09:28.170 --> 00:09:32.110
and it's actually being ignored by academics that teach us about our ancient

159
00:09:32.260 --> 00:09:34.070
past. If you followed my other videos,

160
00:09:34.071 --> 00:09:37.820
you've heard me discuss numerous lines of evidence about how ancient humans were

161
00:09:37.840 --> 00:09:41.140
far older and advanced than we were ever taught in school. So in other words,

162
00:09:41.320 --> 00:09:44.660
in advanced civilization, not necessarily as advanced as we are today,

163
00:09:44.960 --> 00:09:48.020
but advanced enough to do things that we can't wrap our minds around in at least

164
00:09:48.021 --> 00:09:49.420
involving this ancient stonework.

165
00:09:49.890 --> 00:09:54.060
Something happened to them about 12 to 13,000 years ago during the younger dries

166
00:09:54.061 --> 00:09:56.930
cataclysmic event, which they don't don't teach that in school either.

167
00:09:57.350 --> 00:09:59.450
And basically over the last 13,000 years,

168
00:09:59.630 --> 00:10:03.530
the sands of time have eroded and erased pretty much everything other than

169
00:10:03.531 --> 00:10:04.570
megalithic stone work.

170
00:10:04.870 --> 00:10:09.210
So when I see this box and the 2000 year old narrative within every single news

171
00:10:09.211 --> 00:10:12.450
article on the topic, it feels like a foolish rush to judgment.

172
00:10:13.270 --> 00:10:17.520
The only reason why they came to this 2000 year old theory was because of this

173
00:10:17.560 --> 00:10:22.400
deteriorated alabaster head found not far from this granite box and

174
00:10:22.401 --> 00:10:24.680
this alabaster head is clearly Greco Roman.

175
00:10:24.940 --> 00:10:29.360
So the timeframe would coincide with Alexander, the great being in Alexandria.

176
00:10:29.500 --> 00:10:31.000
So perhaps yeah,

177
00:10:31.001 --> 00:10:35.200
maybe some nobleman living there at that time is buried in this box. I mean,

178
00:10:35.201 --> 00:10:38.150
really it would not support me of some rich prick.

179
00:10:38.151 --> 00:10:42.430
Roman took this box for himself to be buried in and that's who we find inside.

180
00:10:43.130 --> 00:10:46.150
And of course the Romans were there and set up shop in Alexandria.

181
00:10:46.250 --> 00:10:50.350
So of course it would make sense to find some notable burials in that area.

182
00:10:50.930 --> 00:10:53.910
But that doesn't mean that this box was created at that time.

183
00:10:54.420 --> 00:10:58.260
What I do know is if they don't open this sealed circle, fagus on live video,

184
00:10:58.470 --> 00:11:02.500
conspiracy theories will likely be formed by people who are aware of the various

185
00:11:02.590 --> 00:11:07.180
cover ups of the past involving the ancient Egyptians and modern antiquities

186
00:11:07.650 --> 00:11:08.620
make no mistake.

187
00:11:08.640 --> 00:11:12.260
And I'm not suggesting that anyone involved in this discovery would do anything

188
00:11:12.261 --> 00:11:16.700
to cover up or mislead anyone or anything. But with that said,

189
00:11:16.750 --> 00:11:21.490
there is reason to not have full transparency and public involvement in this

190
00:11:21.491 --> 00:11:25.730
discovery. I mean, there's really no acceptable reason to do this off camera.

191
00:11:25.870 --> 00:11:27.730
Is there, I mean, because of technology,

192
00:11:27.790 --> 00:11:30.010
the whole world can pretty much watch this live.

193
00:11:30.510 --> 00:11:34.290
So there's really no reason to not do that unless there's something I'm missing

194
00:11:34.320 --> 00:11:35.153
here. Right.

195
00:11:35.320 --> 00:11:38.920
Just think about how exciting and what an incredible event it would for people

196
00:11:38.921 --> 00:11:41.600
from around the world to be able to tune in and watch this on TV.

197
00:11:41.940 --> 00:11:43.480
Or like I said, even on YouTube,

198
00:11:43.481 --> 00:11:46.120
because then they wouldn't even have to plan around network schedules or

199
00:11:46.320 --> 00:11:49.200
anything. They could do it for free on YouTube. In fact, they could,

200
00:11:49.270 --> 00:11:52.080
they could make money doing it and they could use that money for future

201
00:11:52.110 --> 00:11:53.520
excavations. And on.

202
00:11:53.520 --> 00:11:57.840
<v 1>Top of all that this is a huge PR opportunity for Egyptian antiquities,</v>

203
00:11:57.841 --> 00:12:02.720
which are eager to develop and grow Egyptians tourism within ancient sites in

204
00:12:02.721 --> 00:12:04.800
the country in general. So with all this said,

205
00:12:04.801 --> 00:12:07.880
it will be very exciting to see over the next couple days when they finally do

206
00:12:07.881 --> 00:12:11.800
open this and what we find inside well, that is unless they don't video it,

207
00:12:12.790 --> 00:12:15.990
they wait days and weeks into the future before finally sharing with the public,

208
00:12:15.991 --> 00:12:19.550
what they found, which is something they've done numerous times in the past.

209
00:12:20.060 --> 00:12:21.630
Anyways, guys, I'm gonna leave it at that,

210
00:12:21.650 --> 00:12:24.550
but leave a comment and let me know what your thoughts are on all of this and
