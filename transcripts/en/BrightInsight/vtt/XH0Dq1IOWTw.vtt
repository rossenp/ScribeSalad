00:00:01.740 --> 00:00:05.600
<v 0>How about that view? Huh? That is the great pyramid of be the Egypt.</v>

2
00:00:06.600 --> 00:00:09.960
And here I am, this is the view of my room. I can't believe it.

3
00:00:10.060 --> 00:00:12.960
I'm pinching myself. It's surreal that I'm finally here.

4
00:00:13.870 --> 00:00:18.080
I've been wanting to come to Egypt for years and now I'm finally here. Uh,

5
00:00:18.180 --> 00:00:19.440
and it's been amazing so far.

6
00:00:19.720 --> 00:00:22.630
I got here &lt;affirmative&gt; so right now it's Sunday morning, Egypt time,

7
00:00:22.730 --> 00:00:26.430
the sun just rose about a half hour ago and I got here Thursday evening.

8
00:00:26.890 --> 00:00:27.790
So for the last two days,

9
00:00:27.791 --> 00:00:31.830
I've been exploring the Giza plateau with my buddy Ben and a few other guys that

10
00:00:31.831 --> 00:00:36.590
came early and this place has exceeded my expectations,

11
00:00:36.640 --> 00:00:37.670
which is saying something,

12
00:00:37.671 --> 00:00:41.380
cuz I already had high expectations cuz I already knew that the there's

13
00:00:41.490 --> 00:00:43.460
something very, very special about Egypt.

14
00:00:44.140 --> 00:00:46.740
It was far beyond what most people realize and okay, so hold on.

15
00:00:46.810 --> 00:00:49.740
That is the great pyramid of Giza. Let see if I can zoom it all. Nope.

16
00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:55.300
That is a, the, the size of a 47 story building

17
00:00:57.560 --> 00:00:59.100
closer to 500 feet tall.

18
00:00:59.450 --> 00:01:02.930
This is not doing it justice because I'm looking at the camera.

19
00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:07.290
I'm looking at this. Yeah. It's like twice as big in my view.

20
00:01:07.750 --> 00:01:10.130
And it's really, really close. It's about 500 meters away.

21
00:01:10.131 --> 00:01:14.970
You can walk there in less than 10 minutes and guys I have

22
00:01:14.971 --> 00:01:15.470
been,

23
00:01:15.470 --> 00:01:20.290
so here's the thing I've taken more than 2000 photos on my camera in the last

24
00:01:20.350 --> 00:01:21.183
two days.

25
00:01:22.040 --> 00:01:24.640
And that doesn't include videos and that doesn't include everything I've taken

26
00:01:24.660 --> 00:01:28.360
on my cell phone that I'm using right now, shooting this on the iPhone 12 pro.

27
00:01:28.361 --> 00:01:32.360
If you're curious, I recommend this camera guys yesterday.

28
00:01:32.440 --> 00:01:36.760
I went inside the second pyramid, the pyramid of KARE, allegedly.

29
00:01:36.761 --> 00:01:40.160
It's not really that it's not his pyramid. Let's be real. And holy.

30
00:01:41.740 --> 00:01:46.550
So first of all, cameras are not allowed in there. But if you give turns out,

31
00:01:46.551 --> 00:01:48.990
money in this world will get you things that you wouldn't get. Otherwise,

32
00:01:49.090 --> 00:01:53.030
if you guys haven't figured that out yet and oh my God, did I get some videos?

33
00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:55.430
And some pictures I can't.

34
00:01:55.431 --> 00:01:59.790
I was like almost I was speechless. It exceeded

35
00:02:01.940 --> 00:02:02.950
guys, wait till you see,

36
00:02:03.260 --> 00:02:06.700
I already have numerous video ideas to come from the things that I've seen in

37
00:02:06.701 --> 00:02:09.420
the last couple days. Things that I never even knew existed,

38
00:02:09.960 --> 00:02:14.300
it is unreal how much there is to see here and how impressive it is. And,

39
00:02:14.860 --> 00:02:18.860
and I'm gonna, I was talking to Ben from uncharted ex of course, you know, Ben,

40
00:02:18.960 --> 00:02:22.980
go follow him if you're not already. And uh, cuz this is his story's putting on.

41
00:02:23.080 --> 00:02:26.810
And the wonder of full people with the chem at school of mysticism with us and

42
00:02:27.560 --> 00:02:31.250
guys like this is absolutely insane.

43
00:02:31.480 --> 00:02:35.330
Just how much there is to see and just how, uh, it's nuts.

44
00:02:35.890 --> 00:02:39.690
I think I lost my train of thought. Uh I'm on a few hours of sleep. This is,

45
00:02:39.850 --> 00:02:43.490
what's so funny. So I've been jet lagged, but I'm not complaining. I've been,

46
00:02:43.690 --> 00:02:47.800
uh, in last four days, I think I've gotten probably 15 or 16 hours of sleep,

47
00:02:48.380 --> 00:02:52.000
but yet I'm so awake. Like I can't, it's hard to sleep. It's just so much to do.

48
00:02:52.260 --> 00:02:54.640
And where do I even begin?

49
00:02:54.680 --> 00:02:58.000
I was gonna make you guys a vlog talking about my travels and what it took to

50
00:02:58.001 --> 00:02:58.834
get here, which was.

51
00:02:59.380 --> 00:03:04.080
<v 1>Not easy. But like now that I'm here and I've been like going in head first into</v>

52
00:03:04.081 --> 00:03:06.160
everything, like who cares about that flight?

53
00:03:06.161 --> 00:03:08.880
Who cares about connecting in Germany? I mean, all that was interesting.

54
00:03:08.881 --> 00:03:10.560
There's plenty of stuff to chat about with that, but

55
00:03:12.100 --> 00:03:15.160
I'm an Egypt now and I'm so blessed guys

56
00:03:16.560 --> 00:03:20.910
starting this YouTube channel. I, I got off the couch,

57
00:03:21.750 --> 00:03:22.310
I had a job.

58
00:03:22.310 --> 00:03:25.750
I didn't like I chose to go back to school to get a graduate degree thinking

59
00:03:25.751 --> 00:03:27.550
it's gonna bring me, uh,

60
00:03:27.710 --> 00:03:32.390
a cushy desk job and make a bunch of money only to realize that it was the path

61
00:03:32.530 --> 00:03:34.350
to unhappiness.

62
00:03:34.650 --> 00:03:38.470
And there I was sitting on the couch and I've always been into the Egyptians

63
00:03:38.520 --> 00:03:40.820
since sixth grade. When we learned about it in school,

64
00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:44.620
it was like that one topic that kept me focused, whereas like math class,

65
00:03:44.720 --> 00:03:49.140
I'm like, &lt;laugh&gt; looking around the room ad kicking in. And um,

66
00:03:49.960 --> 00:03:51.780
but with Egyptians I've always thought it was amazing.

67
00:03:52.880 --> 00:03:57.860
And I was on the couch as 2015 and I was not particularly happy in life.

68
00:03:58.140 --> 00:04:01.210
I felt like there was, I was just off my path and there was more to it.

69
00:04:01.211 --> 00:04:04.450
And there I was just on the internet looking at videos on YouTube.

70
00:04:04.790 --> 00:04:09.330
And I came across a video of us, I and Brian Forrester. Um,

71
00:04:10.150 --> 00:04:13.730
and they were at the Sierra PM looking at the a hundred ton or 70 plus ton,

72
00:04:13.731 --> 00:04:17.370
a hundred ton stone boxes, which we're gonna go see today. So there I was,

73
00:04:17.770 --> 00:04:19.610
I sat up on my couch and I was looking at this.

74
00:04:19.630 --> 00:04:23.440
I'm like how I never seen or heard of this stuff before and,

75
00:04:23.720 --> 00:04:26.840
and the mystery behind it that even the Egyptian antiquity department admits

76
00:04:26.841 --> 00:04:28.880
they have no idea how that stuff was made.

77
00:04:29.260 --> 00:04:33.680
So it's funny how it's come full circle that here I am now making a video,

78
00:04:34.790 --> 00:04:39.320
looking at the pyramid from my hotel room, I feel so blessed and so fortunate.

79
00:04:39.380 --> 00:04:42.030
And it's because of all of even watching my videos, guys,

80
00:04:42.070 --> 00:04:43.310
I make money from the ad revenue.

81
00:04:44.610 --> 00:04:48.750
So you watching a video has helped me get here. All my Paton supporters,

82
00:04:49.150 --> 00:04:51.990
everyone, all the good vibes you guys are wonderful.

83
00:04:52.250 --> 00:04:56.590
And my point about getting off the couch, anything you wanna do in life,

84
00:04:56.591 --> 00:04:59.830
you can do the lot of attraction works. If you, if you focus on good things,

85
00:05:00.510 --> 00:05:04.420
positive gratitude and focus an attention on doing something and tip,

86
00:05:04.570 --> 00:05:09.060
take action steps in that direction, it will, it will materialize it. Um,

87
00:05:09.410 --> 00:05:12.060
it's real. And when I say I'm pinching myself here,

88
00:05:12.160 --> 00:05:14.020
I'm like seeing is believing.

89
00:05:14.021 --> 00:05:17.060
I envision this in my mind and some people think that's all. Woo, woo guys. Woo.

90
00:05:17.220 --> 00:05:20.420
Woo is real. But even if you don't want, think of it as woo, woo.

91
00:05:20.421 --> 00:05:23.490
Just think of it as the power of the human mind and making things happen for

92
00:05:23.650 --> 00:05:25.610
yourself. We all have choices. We have free will.

93
00:05:26.470 --> 00:05:28.850
The world is operating in a way that makes people think otherwise,

94
00:05:29.670 --> 00:05:33.450
but that's not the case. We're far more powerful. Anyway, let me,

95
00:05:33.610 --> 00:05:36.330
lemme stop rambling on that. So we're gonna go see a bunch of stuff today.

96
00:05:36.910 --> 00:05:39.370
The last couple days, um, like I said,

97
00:05:39.371 --> 00:05:43.600
I've taken a few thousand photos and there's a lot come. Um,

98
00:05:43.920 --> 00:05:46.400
I don't even know where to begin. There's just so much like the stuff I saw,

99
00:05:46.750 --> 00:05:50.640
hold on, arms getting tired, the stuff I saw today, or excuse me yesterday.

100
00:05:50.760 --> 00:05:53.440
And the day before exceeded my expectations. Like I said,

101
00:05:53.441 --> 00:05:54.720
there's things in the Giza plateau.

102
00:05:54.721 --> 00:05:59.640
We're talking like these 120 plus ton limestone cut rocks

103
00:05:59.641 --> 00:06:02.680
that are right on the Causeway leading up to the, uh, second pyramid.

104
00:06:03.580 --> 00:06:07.320
And like it's just stuff I'd never even seen or heard of before. That is unreal.

105
00:06:08.140 --> 00:06:12.000
So anyway, I'm all over the place. I'm rambling. We're all meeting.

106
00:06:12.600 --> 00:06:14.120
Or let me back up last night,

107
00:06:14.340 --> 00:06:17.550
the tour officially kicked off with the introductory dinner and wow.

108
00:06:17.551 --> 00:06:19.550
What a great, so there's 33 of us,

109
00:06:19.740 --> 00:06:24.590
including Ben and myself and what a wonderful group of people, such good vibes.

110
00:06:24.591 --> 00:06:25.830
People from all over the world.

111
00:06:25.831 --> 00:06:28.990
We have people from mostly from the United States, but from Canada,

112
00:06:29.300 --> 00:06:31.790
England Denmark, the Netherlands checklist, Zakia,

113
00:06:31.980 --> 00:06:34.910
even people that originated in Egypt all over the place.

114
00:06:35.130 --> 00:06:39.300
And it's so it's amazing because everyone's on the same wavelength

115
00:06:39.890 --> 00:06:43.140
besides the fact that everyone here is into the ancient Egyptians.

116
00:06:43.710 --> 00:06:45.660
We're all traveling in November of 2020,

117
00:06:45.661 --> 00:06:49.740
which I don't know if you've noticed things were a little nuts and people have

118
00:06:49.741 --> 00:06:53.660
been cooped up in the house. The whole world is guys are all this together.

119
00:06:53.710 --> 00:06:58.530
Jesus like this world is upside down and it so refreshing to be

120
00:06:58.531 --> 00:07:01.650
linking up with other like-minded people that are in the same boat that it's

121
00:07:01.651 --> 00:07:05.130
like, you know, get busy living, get busy dying. Let's go see this stuff.

122
00:07:05.160 --> 00:07:09.290
Life is short. So I just have an overwhelming feeling of gratitude.

123
00:07:09.680 --> 00:07:12.770
Like thank you, universe that I'm here and thank you to everyone.

124
00:07:12.771 --> 00:07:14.290
That's supported me. Uh,

125
00:07:14.490 --> 00:07:17.450
I haven't even gone through all the comments for my last photo just because I've

126
00:07:17.451 --> 00:07:21.560
been so freaking busy, but everything that I've seen so far, you guys are,

127
00:07:22.460 --> 00:07:25.720
it warms my heart and I'm beyond grateful. So just thank you.

128
00:07:25.780 --> 00:07:29.840
So take in that view, pictures are not doing it justice.

129
00:07:30.270 --> 00:07:31.840
Like how small that looks it guys,

130
00:07:31.841 --> 00:07:35.200
when you get up close to it and you see how big these freaking stones are at its

131
00:07:35.201 --> 00:07:38.870
base. You're like what? It's so deceiving. You'll be getting close to the of it.

132
00:07:38.871 --> 00:07:40.110
And you'll think you're closer than you are.

133
00:07:40.370 --> 00:07:44.950
And you keep walking and walking and walking and walking and you're still not

134
00:07:44.951 --> 00:07:45.780
getting closer to it.

135
00:07:45.780 --> 00:07:50.030
It's like it is freaking huge and that is 203 levels

136
00:07:50.770 --> 00:07:54.910
or stacks of blocks. So take it all in anyways, guys,

137
00:07:54.970 --> 00:07:57.750
I'm gonna be posting a lot more. I took a,

138
00:07:57.751 --> 00:07:59.900
I took an entire video tour of the second pyramid.

139
00:08:00.720 --> 00:08:04.460
So I should just upload that it's like a four or five minute video, but uh, um,

140
00:08:04.510 --> 00:08:08.060
maybe I'll save it for one of my videos when I get back. I don't know.

141
00:08:08.061 --> 00:08:10.260
I have to pick and choose, but I'm gonna send to Instagram.

142
00:08:10.280 --> 00:08:12.580
I'm just gonna start dumping things on here to keep you guys posted,

143
00:08:12.760 --> 00:08:15.460
but I'm gonna wrap this up. Um,

144
00:08:17.040 --> 00:08:21.410
I'm gonna go finish some coffee and make a meet up with my tour group. And uh,

145
00:08:22.890 --> 00:08:26.130
I guess I'll just leave it at that. I love y'all. Bye.
