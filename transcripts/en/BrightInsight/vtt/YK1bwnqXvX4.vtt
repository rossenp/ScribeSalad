00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:05.560
<v 0>Petra also known as the lost city of stone is made up of massive structures that</v>

2
00:00:05.561 --> 00:00:07.640
are sculpted right outta the side of canyon walls,

3
00:00:08.100 --> 00:00:12.720
hidden in the remote mountains of Jordan and is one of the most underrated sites

4
00:00:12.780 --> 00:00:14.640
of lost ancient human civilization.

5
00:00:15.140 --> 00:00:16.960
And when I say that these structures are massive,

6
00:00:17.270 --> 00:00:20.440
just compare the size of the doorways to people as he,

7
00:00:20.510 --> 00:00:23.030
you can see here at some of the most famous sites within Petra,

8
00:00:23.330 --> 00:00:26.550
but what is perhaps even more interesting than that is that even though most

9
00:00:26.551 --> 00:00:29.270
people at some point have seen these iconic photos,

10
00:00:29.930 --> 00:00:33.270
few people have any idea of what's actually on the other side of these doorways.

11
00:00:33.650 --> 00:00:34.483
And in this video,

12
00:00:34.850 --> 00:00:38.790
I'm going to show you some incredible images of what's inside these structures,

13
00:00:39.350 --> 00:00:43.900
particularly the so-called re also the so-called

14
00:00:44.380 --> 00:00:48.100
earn tomb. And of course the so-called monastery.

15
00:00:48.680 --> 00:00:51.020
And I'm going to show you a few others as well now,

16
00:00:51.021 --> 00:00:54.300
unless you've watched certain documentaries about Petra and I've watched a few,

17
00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:58.420
but I was actually surprised to see on just how little is actually shown of

18
00:00:58.421 --> 00:01:00.580
what's inside these structures. And by the way,

19
00:01:00.581 --> 00:01:02.850
they certainly don't share it's in the public school system,

20
00:01:02.851 --> 00:01:04.410
at least not here in the United States.

21
00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:07.730
So unless you've taken it upon yourself to do research on this topic,

22
00:01:07.910 --> 00:01:09.690
you probably don't know much about Petra.

23
00:01:10.150 --> 00:01:13.890
Let me start by showing you how to even get into the city of Petra in the first

24
00:01:13.900 --> 00:01:16.850
place at the entrance of what's called the Sikh,

25
00:01:17.450 --> 00:01:19.650
a narrow three quarter of a mile long canyon,

26
00:01:19.750 --> 00:01:24.720
or 1.2 kilometers and a is up to 80 meters deep or 260

27
00:01:24.830 --> 00:01:25.663
feet.

28
00:01:25.820 --> 00:01:29.880
One thing that's incredible about the sea besides its beauty is that the ancient

29
00:01:29.881 --> 00:01:33.960
inhabitants of this site cut out a water channel that extends a mile and a half

30
00:01:33.961 --> 00:01:34.794
through the sea.

31
00:01:35.140 --> 00:01:38.600
And you can see it here on both sides of the sandstone canyon walls.

32
00:01:39.020 --> 00:01:40.760
And when you finally get to the end of the sea,

33
00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:43.750
the first thing you see is what's referred or two as the treasury,

34
00:01:43.840 --> 00:01:47.150
which is undoubtedly the most famous site at Petra.

35
00:01:47.610 --> 00:01:49.950
And take a look at the view from above of the area.

36
00:01:50.170 --> 00:01:53.510
And also note that the arrow, which I placed, it's not precise,

37
00:01:53.511 --> 00:01:56.590
but it simply just represents the direction of coming out of the seat.

38
00:01:57.050 --> 00:02:01.270
The treasury though is massive. It's 131 feet high,

39
00:02:01.330 --> 00:02:06.060
or about 40 meters and 80 feet wide or about 25 meters. And in fact,

40
00:02:06.130 --> 00:02:10.500
it's so tall that the sculpture itself is twice the height of the carved faces

41
00:02:10.520 --> 00:02:14.940
on the Mount Rushmore monument. And the precision is simply remarkable,

42
00:02:14.970 --> 00:02:18.660
similar to the works of the ancient Greeks, but this is unique in its own way.

43
00:02:18.720 --> 00:02:22.700
And is one of a kind, so the big question is how did they do this?

44
00:02:23.160 --> 00:02:25.890
We can see evidence of chiseling on the sandstone.

45
00:02:26.070 --> 00:02:30.210
And although sandstone is typically quite soft and easy to work with this

46
00:02:30.211 --> 00:02:33.330
particular sandstone is quite hard requiring steel tooling,

47
00:02:33.780 --> 00:02:36.650
which did exist at the time. And according to textbooks,

48
00:02:36.740 --> 00:02:41.410
Petra was created around 2000 to 2,500 years ago by the NABI

49
00:02:41.850 --> 00:02:42.160
tens.

50
00:02:42.160 --> 00:02:46.960
This is of course debated because abit were essentially beta in or nomadic tent

51
00:02:46.961 --> 00:02:49.400
dwellers. I for one do not believe it.

52
00:02:49.401 --> 00:02:53.680
And I strongly suspect that the Nabit simply found this site and inhabited it

53
00:02:53.950 --> 00:02:57.400
just like the Romans did when they found it later on and built upon it.

54
00:02:57.420 --> 00:02:59.160
And as you can see here in a few examples,

55
00:02:59.540 --> 00:03:03.760
but ultimately the original builders of Petra are unknown and there is a serious

56
00:03:03.870 --> 00:03:08.280
lack of physical evidence to suggest that the Nat did this. Now,

57
00:03:08.281 --> 00:03:12.160
this is not to say that it wasn't possible to do with people with steel chisels.

58
00:03:12.161 --> 00:03:13.240
It certainly was possible.

59
00:03:13.580 --> 00:03:16.800
And you can see examples of this in the cutout sandstone. Like I mentioned,

60
00:03:16.801 --> 00:03:17.620
however,

61
00:03:17.620 --> 00:03:22.550
the amount of time in difficulty to do this is beyond incredible to get a

62
00:03:22.551 --> 00:03:24.950
better understanding of this. And without further ado,

63
00:03:24.951 --> 00:03:28.070
let's take a look at what's actually inside the so-called treasury.

64
00:03:28.690 --> 00:03:31.470
As you can see, when you walk up the steps, there are three doors,

65
00:03:31.850 --> 00:03:35.030
two smaller ones on each side and a massive door in the center,

66
00:03:35.420 --> 00:03:38.510
walking in through the main door. This is what you see.

67
00:03:38.650 --> 00:03:43.620
You enter a chamber with three more doors. These doors are seemingly just small.

68
00:03:43.940 --> 00:03:47.620
I don't know, closets chambers, tombs. I don't know what to make of it.

69
00:03:47.670 --> 00:03:49.220
Leave a comment if you have an idea,

70
00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:53.100
but you need to compare the size of these doors to people to get a better

71
00:03:53.101 --> 00:03:56.460
understanding of just how massive this room is. And by the way,

72
00:03:56.461 --> 00:03:58.260
if you think that this room is impressive,

73
00:03:58.370 --> 00:04:00.890
wait until you see show you later in this video,

74
00:04:01.990 --> 00:04:04.410
but also look at the incredible precision.

75
00:04:04.470 --> 00:04:08.050
And of course the colors of the blended sandstone is simply beautiful.

76
00:04:08.430 --> 00:04:11.810
But the question is, why did they build this? And what was its original purpose?

77
00:04:12.440 --> 00:04:16.090
It's been called the treasury because legends go back stating that riches were

78
00:04:16.091 --> 00:04:18.970
kept in stored here, but what its actual purpose was,

79
00:04:18.971 --> 00:04:23.480
nobody can say for this is a view looking outside the chamber and you can see

80
00:04:23.500 --> 00:04:26.960
the seek from which we would've come in at and looking left. And right,

81
00:04:26.961 --> 00:04:29.800
there are two additional doors on each side. Like I mentioned yet,

82
00:04:30.360 --> 00:04:32.840
I could not find one single photo or video of,

83
00:04:33.080 --> 00:04:35.440
of what's inside them or how big they actually are.

84
00:04:35.980 --> 00:04:38.320
And none of the documentaries I saw showed it either.

85
00:04:38.340 --> 00:04:42.110
And I'm guessing that they are just too small rooms with high ceilings. I mean,

86
00:04:42.270 --> 00:04:43.103
that, that's a question,

87
00:04:43.490 --> 00:04:46.990
but that's not all because there is an additional chamber directly below the

88
00:04:47.110 --> 00:04:49.550
treasury, which is now sealed under a locked gate.

89
00:04:50.230 --> 00:04:53.510
I have no pictures and I've seen no videos of what's inside this underground

90
00:04:53.511 --> 00:04:57.350
chamber either. But my understanding is that it's about 100 feet long,

91
00:04:57.590 --> 00:04:59.750
a hundred feet wide and 30 feet high.

92
00:05:00.330 --> 00:05:05.020
And some through 300,000 cubic feet of stone was removed in just that one

93
00:05:05.021 --> 00:05:05.800
chamber alone.

94
00:05:05.800 --> 00:05:09.820
And this doesn't include the millions of cubic feet of stone that was ultimately

95
00:05:09.850 --> 00:05:14.260
removed from the nearly 30 large chambers located throughout Petra.

96
00:05:14.760 --> 00:05:15.520
In fact,

97
00:05:15.520 --> 00:05:19.740
the treasury only makes up 1% of Petra and take a quick look at this map,

98
00:05:20.130 --> 00:05:22.170
looking right, uh, from right to left,

99
00:05:22.190 --> 00:05:25.810
as it begins at the entrance of the seat and extends actually a total of 12

100
00:05:25.811 --> 00:05:30.530
kilometers or seven miles to the so-called monastery on the upper left,

101
00:05:30.531 --> 00:05:33.770
which I'll be showing you in just a moment. So leaving the treasury,

102
00:05:34.030 --> 00:05:37.250
you see that there is an additional side canyon that leads to what they call the

103
00:05:37.251 --> 00:05:41.970
street of facades homes and tombs carved into stone walls and here,

104
00:05:42.280 --> 00:05:43.680
and see an example of one of the tombs.

105
00:05:43.680 --> 00:05:45.920
And there were many found throughout Petra by the way,

106
00:05:46.700 --> 00:05:48.440
and notice the evidence of chiseling,

107
00:05:48.700 --> 00:05:51.840
but there are also homes and chambers that you can see here as well.

108
00:05:52.020 --> 00:05:54.840
And it really makes you wonder what was once inside these places,

109
00:05:54.841 --> 00:05:56.440
because if they can cut stone,

110
00:05:56.780 --> 00:05:58.960
surely they can create some interesting furniture,

111
00:05:58.961 --> 00:06:02.520
which is of course long since gone. But as we continue the path,

112
00:06:02.620 --> 00:06:04.240
we come up on the Petra theater,

113
00:06:04.250 --> 00:06:07.080
which was carved right out of the sandstone surroundings.

114
00:06:07.900 --> 00:06:11.760
The theater's auditorium consists of three horizontal sections of seats

115
00:06:11.761 --> 00:06:15.680
separated by passageways and seven stairways to ascend.

116
00:06:16.540 --> 00:06:20.790
This theater could accommodate approximately 8,500 people,

117
00:06:21.280 --> 00:06:25.590
which is more than the estimated 6,000 seats of the Amman theater within the

118
00:06:25.750 --> 00:06:28.070
capital of Jordan, which was constructed by the Romans.

119
00:06:28.990 --> 00:06:32.870
I would just love to have seen this theater at its peak before the sands of time

120
00:06:32.970 --> 00:06:36.550
got to it. And I can only imagine how much work was put into creating this,

121
00:06:37.300 --> 00:06:38.780
but as we continue on from the theater,

122
00:06:38.960 --> 00:06:42.740
we pass more incredible facades and there are hundreds of them found throughout

123
00:06:42.830 --> 00:06:43.280
Petra.

124
00:06:43.280 --> 00:06:47.500
All of which would be incredibly difficult to construct with just chisels.

125
00:06:48.200 --> 00:06:51.700
And this takes us to, what's referred to as the U tomb,

126
00:06:51.890 --> 00:06:54.580
like I mentioned earlier, you can see the lower part of it,

127
00:06:54.581 --> 00:06:56.140
which was added by the Romans,

128
00:06:57.080 --> 00:07:00.690
but just how high up they went to cut this out is impressive.

129
00:07:00.870 --> 00:07:04.690
But what you're about to see inside this doorway is simply amazing.

130
00:07:05.360 --> 00:07:08.610
Look at that. It's difficult to even know what to say about it.

131
00:07:08.830 --> 00:07:11.890
The colors of the ceiling from the cutout sandstone is astounding,

132
00:07:12.350 --> 00:07:16.010
but the size of this chamber is also better appreciated when you compare it to

133
00:07:16.011 --> 00:07:17.170
people inside of it.

134
00:07:18.350 --> 00:07:21.360
What was the purpose of these cutouts on the sides of the walls?

135
00:07:21.950 --> 00:07:25.520
What was the purpose of this room and what did it look like thousands of years

136
00:07:25.620 --> 00:07:29.720
ago when it was presumably furnished or used for whatever it was not to mention

137
00:07:30.190 --> 00:07:33.840
that a few hundred thousand cubic feet of stone had to be cut out and removed

138
00:07:34.140 --> 00:07:37.200
and they did so with such incredible precision, as you can see.

139
00:07:37.580 --> 00:07:41.510
But another question is why do they choose to make the ceilings this high?

140
00:07:41.860 --> 00:07:44.430
It's one thing to create something that is meant to awe people,

141
00:07:44.520 --> 00:07:45.670
which it certainly does,

142
00:07:46.290 --> 00:07:49.510
but they certainly did not have to make the ceiling this high up to impress

143
00:07:49.511 --> 00:07:51.790
anyone. I mean, even if it was just a few feet lower,

144
00:07:52.330 --> 00:07:54.150
it would've been just as amazing yet.

145
00:07:54.151 --> 00:07:56.630
It would've saved a ton of time and energy,

146
00:07:57.010 --> 00:08:00.460
but your guess is as good as anyone else's as to what the purpose of this room

147
00:08:00.520 --> 00:08:03.260
was. Academics will tell you that this was a tomb,

148
00:08:03.261 --> 00:08:06.020
which is their explanation for most everything else at Petra.

149
00:08:06.120 --> 00:08:10.540
And it's also their explanation for most all megalithic structures found

150
00:08:10.541 --> 00:08:11.500
throughout the ancient world.

151
00:08:11.810 --> 00:08:16.420
It's either a temple or a tomb as if that's all the ancients ever did was pray

152
00:08:16.421 --> 00:08:20.050
all the time and plan their burials for their deaths down the road. Like,

153
00:08:20.250 --> 00:08:21.370
come on, put that aside.

154
00:08:21.590 --> 00:08:26.010
The so-called earn tomb is surrounded by additional structures on the left and

155
00:08:26.011 --> 00:08:30.490
right, and upon a closer view, look at how massive it is compared to people.

156
00:08:31.200 --> 00:08:34.450
Also note the weather erosion and various damage on the structure,

157
00:08:34.910 --> 00:08:36.970
but this is not all that Petra has to offer.

158
00:08:37.070 --> 00:08:38.730
And before I show you the monastery,

159
00:08:39.190 --> 00:08:42.200
we must pass through through the city center, which I'll quickly touch on.

160
00:08:42.670 --> 00:08:47.200
What you see here is referred to as the great temple. Yep. It must be a temple,

161
00:08:47.260 --> 00:08:51.720
of course &lt;laugh&gt; but some 30,000 people are estimated to have lived in Petra at

162
00:08:51.780 --> 00:08:52.380
its peak.

163
00:08:52.380 --> 00:08:56.800
And what you're looking at is what's left of a massive complex of more than 100

164
00:08:56.910 --> 00:08:57.743
pillars.

165
00:08:58.160 --> 00:09:02.120
I imagine that what this looked like completed was probably beyond impressive.

166
00:09:02.540 --> 00:09:04.440
And some people have theorized the possibilities,

167
00:09:04.540 --> 00:09:06.040
as you can see here in this image.

168
00:09:06.620 --> 00:09:10.800
So going from the city center to the monastery requires a difficult hike up the

169
00:09:10.801 --> 00:09:13.200
Stonehill on foot. And as you can see,

170
00:09:13.260 --> 00:09:16.230
the design and size of this is truly astonishing.

171
00:09:16.650 --> 00:09:21.310
The so-called monastery measures 160 feet wide or 50 meters by

172
00:09:21.311 --> 00:09:26.190
approximately 148 feet high or 45 meters making it 20

173
00:09:26.191 --> 00:09:29.870
feet taller than the treasury and twice as wide. And again,

174
00:09:29.940 --> 00:09:33.790
it's a must to compare its size to people to truly appreciate its eminence.

175
00:09:34.450 --> 00:09:37.500
I'm not exact be sure how tall this door is, but wow.

176
00:09:37.760 --> 00:09:40.180
And the step itself is up to our necks.

177
00:09:40.290 --> 00:09:43.060
Perhaps there are some missing stairs that were destroyed long ago.

178
00:09:43.640 --> 00:09:45.340
If you take a look at the front of the structure,

179
00:09:45.440 --> 00:09:49.580
it appears to have some unique damage on the lower part of it is is this weather

180
00:09:50.020 --> 00:09:54.220
related and why is the rest of it without damage? But getting back to its size,

181
00:09:54.370 --> 00:09:57.810
take a look at the are circular part of the structure at the top,

182
00:09:58.470 --> 00:10:02.650
and now compare it to a person that is standing on it. Isn't that incredible.

183
00:10:03.450 --> 00:10:03.710
Honestly,

184
00:10:03.710 --> 00:10:08.210
did you have any idea that these structures were this big before I ever did any

185
00:10:08.770 --> 00:10:11.650
research on Petro? I already knew that this site was impressive,

186
00:10:11.651 --> 00:10:14.170
but I had no idea that these structures were this big.

187
00:10:14.470 --> 00:10:18.160
So the question now is what's inside of it. So let's look,

188
00:10:18.310 --> 00:10:22.640
what exactly are we looking at a cutout with a small shallow stage,

189
00:10:22.641 --> 00:10:25.240
with a set of stairs on each side and its size,

190
00:10:25.290 --> 00:10:29.080
again can only be properly appreciated when you can bear it to a person.

191
00:10:29.910 --> 00:10:31.280
What was the purpose of this room?

192
00:10:31.340 --> 00:10:35.200
And why did they go to such extreme extent to build something like this?

193
00:10:35.660 --> 00:10:39.830
All we were left with the a day are guesses, but of course go figure academics,

194
00:10:40.020 --> 00:10:41.470
labeled it, a monastery.

195
00:10:41.970 --> 00:10:45.510
Now people will say as to why they went to such extent to create something so

196
00:10:45.511 --> 00:10:49.390
impressive is because, well, they did it because they could do it well. Yeah,

197
00:10:49.391 --> 00:10:51.870
they could. I agree. Somebody could and did,

198
00:10:52.570 --> 00:10:56.670
but perhaps this was done long ago before this region was as dry as it is now.

199
00:10:57.450 --> 00:11:00.260
Keep in mind that this is one of the driest places on earth,

200
00:11:00.370 --> 00:11:03.100
only receiving a few inches of rainfall every year.

201
00:11:03.800 --> 00:11:07.140
It would make much more sense for this site to have been created further back in

202
00:11:07.141 --> 00:11:08.900
time than just 2000 years ago,

203
00:11:09.170 --> 00:11:11.700
perhaps to a time when the region received more rainfall,

204
00:11:11.730 --> 00:11:13.980
just like what we've learned about ancient Egypt,

205
00:11:13.981 --> 00:11:15.540
once being lush with vegetation,

206
00:11:16.010 --> 00:11:19.810
just think if all of pet was constructed with a huge labor force,

207
00:11:20.160 --> 00:11:23.370
with the slow and painful process of using steel chisels,

208
00:11:24.070 --> 00:11:27.210
why would they do it in the middle of a desert when they would need an abundance

209
00:11:27.310 --> 00:11:30.810
of water? And there is evidence that Petra is very old. In fact,

210
00:11:30.811 --> 00:11:33.770
there was a new monument discovered in 2016,

211
00:11:34.380 --> 00:11:39.080
found by drones and satellite imagery and is described as Heidi in plain sight.

212
00:11:39.220 --> 00:11:40.053
All this time.

213
00:11:40.550 --> 00:11:45.080
This massive platform is twice the size of an Olympic swimming pool and is now

214
00:11:45.081 --> 00:11:49.080
mostly buried. Archeologist said is probably 2000 years old,

215
00:11:49.260 --> 00:11:52.840
but I have a feeling that this thing could be much older than much of Petra

216
00:11:52.940 --> 00:11:54.280
itself. I mean,

217
00:11:54.350 --> 00:11:58.400
look at other structures around Petra that appear to show that some are indeed

218
00:11:58.401 --> 00:11:59.234
older than others.

219
00:11:59.860 --> 00:12:03.000
And as you can see in the example of what's called the OS tomb,

220
00:12:03.630 --> 00:12:06.920
obviously it's heavily aro eroded, especially on the lower part of it.

221
00:12:07.780 --> 00:12:11.200
And look at other images of the structures that seem to have far more weathering

222
00:12:11.201 --> 00:12:15.470
than others. And again, notice their size. And while I'm at it,

223
00:12:15.620 --> 00:12:18.630
take a look at other chambers found throughout the city of Petra.

224
00:12:19.060 --> 00:12:22.030
They just make you wonder what the story is and what they were used for.

225
00:12:22.450 --> 00:12:25.750
And I still can't get over just how awesome the colors of the sandstone are.

226
00:12:26.250 --> 00:12:30.990
But one of the chambers that stands out to me is this one, look at this.

227
00:12:31.700 --> 00:12:33.460
When you see the picture on the left,

228
00:12:33.600 --> 00:12:37.780
you simply have no frame of reference of just how massive it truly is or how

229
00:12:37.781 --> 00:12:40.820
high the ceiling is until you see it with a person, uh, within it.

230
00:12:41.530 --> 00:12:45.580
What on earth was the purpose of this highly precise stonework? Seriously?

231
00:12:45.581 --> 00:12:48.380
What is that like a portal or something? I mean, really?

232
00:12:48.410 --> 00:12:52.220
What was the purpose of making this? Was it just decoration? And again,

233
00:12:52.680 --> 00:12:54.370
why is the ceiling so high?

234
00:12:55.050 --> 00:12:58.410
I think it's possible that Petra was created by the survivors of the last

235
00:12:58.550 --> 00:12:58.971
cataly,

236
00:12:58.971 --> 00:13:03.170
which of course I've shared details on that in prior videos that maybe perhaps

237
00:13:03.280 --> 00:13:07.010
certain technology or knowledge was passed down from the survivors,

238
00:13:07.011 --> 00:13:09.330
which was later used in creating this site.

239
00:13:09.590 --> 00:13:12.730
And I'm not suggesting that Petra is 12,000 years old, either.

240
00:13:12.910 --> 00:13:16.800
I'm simply suggesting there is far more to the story than what we've been told

241
00:13:16.801 --> 00:13:20.760
about it. I also think that the location of Petra is telling a safe place,

242
00:13:20.761 --> 00:13:22.720
hidden from outsiders and elements.

243
00:13:23.210 --> 00:13:26.240
Ultimately the original builders of Petra are unknown,

244
00:13:26.340 --> 00:13:29.880
and we need to consider that there is a serious lack of evidence to actually

245
00:13:29.881 --> 00:13:34.480
suggest that the naans, which again, were nomadic tent dwellers, all the,

246
00:13:34.550 --> 00:13:38.030
of a sudden became sophisticated and decided to construct this site.

247
00:13:38.340 --> 00:13:40.350
This is of course a very debatable topic.

248
00:13:40.490 --> 00:13:42.950
