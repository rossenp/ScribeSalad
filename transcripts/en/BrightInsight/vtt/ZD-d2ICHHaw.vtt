00:00:01.020 --> 00:00:05.400
<v 0>I had the fantastic opportunity of going to Egypt last month. And in that time,</v>

2
00:00:05.401 --> 00:00:09.870
I was able to go inside the second pyramid of Giza on two separate

3
00:00:09.871 --> 00:00:14.010
occasions. And by second pyramid, I'm referring to coffee's pyramid,

4
00:00:14.011 --> 00:00:16.560
but let's be real. It was not his pyramid.

5
00:00:17.130 --> 00:00:21.570
And I'm about to show you nearly 16 minutes of raw unedited video of my tour

6
00:00:21.571 --> 00:00:23.700
inside and out of this incredible structure.

7
00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:27.210
And then you can look and think for yourself as to whether you believe that its

8
00:00:27.211 --> 00:00:30.480
original purpose was to be a tune for the pharaohs.

9
00:00:30.510 --> 00:00:34.710
Now let me also just say that I've been enjoying sharing my raw video footage

10
00:00:34.711 --> 00:00:38.220
from my cell phone with you guys, I've already shared the great pyramid,

11
00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:41.640
the bent pyramid also be showing you inside the Dendera complex,

12
00:00:41.641 --> 00:00:46.290
including hidden chambers there and also forbidden video inside the OSI were

13
00:00:46.291 --> 00:00:50.250
shaft nearly 28 minutes, which I was not supposed to film guys,

14
00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:54.060
but I also know that many of you were excited for me to get back to my typical

15
00:00:54.061 --> 00:00:56.820
type presentation where I show you slides and pictures.

16
00:00:57.120 --> 00:01:01.350
So thankfully I have tens of thousands of photos that I took with my new

17
00:01:01.650 --> 00:01:04.290
mirrorless camera and they are of outstanding quality,

18
00:01:04.440 --> 00:01:06.420
but I've been in the process of an out of state move.

19
00:01:06.421 --> 00:01:10.230
So give me some time to piece those together as I've been consumed with life,

20
00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:14.850
but look forward to these other videos in the interim. And though, yeah. Okay.

21
00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:19.530
I admit I did shoot in vertical most of the time. Whoops, forgive me,

22
00:01:19.531 --> 00:01:20.070
but Hey,

23
00:01:20.070 --> 00:01:24.990
it is still a 4k video and at least it shows you a perspective that you can't

24
00:01:24.991 --> 00:01:28.710
possibly have by seeing pictures and video presentation or slides.

25
00:01:28.711 --> 00:01:32.700
Like I typically show you. So look forward to these other videos in the interim,

26
00:01:32.701 --> 00:01:35.220
but I look forward to making my other type videos real soon,

27
00:01:35.580 --> 00:01:39.150
but without further ado, here's nearly 16 minutes of that.

28
00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:42.030
The first video clip is of my second visit there.

29
00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:45.630
And then the other video clips were from my first visit in there just to kind of

30
00:01:45.690 --> 00:01:49.080
paint you a different picture on how that went down. But without further ado,

31
00:01:49.260 --> 00:01:50.093
here we go.

32
00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:14.693
<v 1>All bedrock.</v>

33
00:02:22.950 --> 00:02:23.783
The second pyramid,

34
00:02:43.950 --> 00:02:48.180
five foot 10 for comparison, 10,

35
00:02:49.170 --> 00:02:50.610
about six feet or so

36
00:02:56.370 --> 00:02:58.380
this is the so-called Queens chamber.

37
00:03:00.730 --> 00:03:04.750
<v 2>I'll bet rock subterranean on the impression that the walls are approximately 30</v>

38
00:03:04.751 --> 00:03:08.830
feet or so high again, all in bedrock,

39
00:03:13.150 --> 00:03:14.920
Going down now backed up.

40
00:04:28.780 --> 00:04:28.840
<v 1>[Inaudible].</v>

41
00:04:28.840 --> 00:04:29.770
<v 2>I think they're on the bus.</v>

42
00:04:42.560 --> 00:04:43.393
<v 1>[Inaudible].</v>

43
00:04:44.380 --> 00:04:47.740
<v 2>It has to be the most impressive heavenly this after this trip,</v>

44
00:04:47.770 --> 00:04:52.750
I believe this pyramid came first before the great pyramid for a number of

45
00:04:52.751 --> 00:04:55.540
reasons, which I'll share in a video,

46
00:04:57.030 --> 00:04:58.030
but I want the tour of this.

47
00:05:05.380 --> 00:05:06.100
<v 1>[Inaudible].</v>

48
00:05:06.100 --> 00:05:07.030
<v 2>This is being shot,</v>

49
00:05:07.720 --> 00:05:12.250
iPhone 12 pro and I have an ultra wide angle 0.5 right now. 10. What? Curious.

50
00:05:45.700 --> 00:05:46.533
<v 1>[Inaudible].</v>

51
00:05:46.780 --> 00:05:48.820
<v 2>Obviously I've been speed walking the whole time.</v>

52
00:05:57.520 --> 00:05:58.353
<v 1>[Inaudible].</v>

53
00:06:05.690 --> 00:06:06.860
<v 2>I don't want to stop recording.</v>

54
00:06:08.060 --> 00:06:10.430
Just letting clear a little bit of distance with my truck.

55
00:06:12.890 --> 00:06:13.970
Don't want to stop recording.

56
00:06:22.010 --> 00:06:26.780
How tall are you, man? Six feet. Good for comparison.

57
00:06:28.070 --> 00:06:29.090
All right away. I go.

58
00:06:35.450 --> 00:06:39.350
I'll live. You got to stay. If you heard that, that was my back.

59
00:06:42.620 --> 00:06:46.430
I wouldn't be surprised. And I tore my shirt. That was,

60
00:06:46.760 --> 00:06:49.190
that was a gash all worth it.

61
00:06:51.020 --> 00:06:54.620
This video just doesn't do justice to the size of the tunnel though.

62
00:06:56.180 --> 00:06:58.790
I'm halfway over. I mean, look at me now I'm leaving.

63
00:07:24.680 --> 00:07:25.520
<v 3>That is a quarry.</v>

64
00:07:33.200 --> 00:07:37.880
I'll just have to put all my thoughts into a video. Not a tomb. Nope,

65
00:07:38.570 --> 00:07:41.270
not a too nice. I don't think so.

66
00:07:44.330 --> 00:07:45.890
It's almost hard to have the words because

67
00:07:47.630 --> 00:07:51.980
not because I'm out of breath because I'm apparently out of shape is a workout

68
00:07:51.981 --> 00:07:52.814
going in there

69
00:07:55.730 --> 00:07:59.990
Goes down all into bedrock, back up. Not much higher than we are now

70
00:08:02.180 --> 00:08:06.770
off of that room. Hope you guys enjoyed this.

71
00:08:07.400 --> 00:08:11.840
I know I did. That was my back look after I took, is it bleeding through?

72
00:08:17.240 --> 00:08:18.073
I'll be all right.

73
00:08:21.710 --> 00:08:25.550
What do you think Ben was a magical experience. You bet.

74
00:08:27.410 --> 00:08:30.980
Yeah, don't go to ancient Rome.

75
00:08:30.981 --> 00:08:35.720
People don't go to don't go to Greece. Come to Egypt. This place is just

76
00:08:37.400 --> 00:08:40.640
y'all missing out. The size of everything is epic.

77
00:08:43.460 --> 00:08:45.530
I was saying like, again, I'm talking to the camera. I don't have the work.

78
00:08:45.570 --> 00:08:47.630
It's hard to know what to describe going in there. I'm like,

79
00:08:48.350 --> 00:08:52.970
I don't get a tomb vibe at all. It's like, you go up here and like,

80
00:08:53.000 --> 00:08:53.390
oh yeah.

81
00:08:53.390 --> 00:08:57.570
Tombs and pyramids for tombs for the pharaohs can hide all their stuff in there.

82
00:08:57.571 --> 00:09:01.260
I'm like you just go straight down and straight up. What mazes there? Yeah.

83
00:09:01.261 --> 00:09:03.480
That one little door thing. Like that's it? Yeah.

84
00:09:05.340 --> 00:09:08.220
There's the so-called great for no is the great pyramid,

85
00:09:09.180 --> 00:09:13.830
but I'm not much bigger than the second. What is it?

86
00:09:13.831 --> 00:09:16.440
30 feet difference. It's not a lot.

87
00:09:25.380 --> 00:09:28.890
No, thank you. Hi, you remember me?

88
00:09:29.490 --> 00:09:33.540
That's it say hi to the camera. Very good. Welcome to Egypt. American forever.

89
00:09:33.570 --> 00:09:38.460
Yes. Yes. Come to Egypt. I ladies. No, no, no, no,

90
00:09:38.470 --> 00:09:42.660
no, no. I appreciate it. I do not. But I thank you Sharon.

91
00:09:43.800 --> 00:09:45.330
They put it in your, they put it in your hands.

92
00:09:45.331 --> 00:09:48.750
That way you'll have to give them money. They do it to everyone.

93
00:09:51.360 --> 00:09:53.760
Hello? Hello?

94
00:10:06.660 --> 00:10:10.200
Who am I stripped again? I've almost fallen and tripped. Uh,

95
00:10:10.890 --> 00:10:14.520
something like 341 times on this trip. I haven't been down once.

96
00:10:15.240 --> 00:10:20.070
Almost rolled my ankle. About another a hundred times. Haven't rolled at once.

97
00:10:21.000 --> 00:10:25.980
Famous last words. I'm just still recording. I don't even know what to say,

98
00:10:25.981 --> 00:10:29.690
but this is fun. I guess I'll post this to Instagram or something. Yeah.

99
00:10:30.630 --> 00:10:35.070
Get all these stones. Lord.

100
00:10:36.840 --> 00:10:38.430
One of those. That's our bus over there.

101
00:10:43.680 --> 00:10:47.940
Hey Ben. So my back real quick. Is it, uh, is it torn or is it whitened?

102
00:10:48.120 --> 00:10:51.000
Anything? You're fine. No mark at all. Oh,

103
00:10:51.010 --> 00:10:54.150
there's a little like little wet mark there. Maybe it's probably blood.

104
00:10:54.750 --> 00:10:57.960
Why what's that from just stabbing my back in the tunnel for fun.

105
00:11:00.030 --> 00:11:02.130
All right. Everyone. Talk to you later.

106
00:11:14.970 --> 00:11:15.803
<v 4>[Inaudible]</v>

107
00:11:39.220 --> 00:11:40.053
[inaudible].

108
00:11:43.380 --> 00:11:44.340
<v 3>More frame of reference.</v>

109
00:11:45.120 --> 00:11:50.010
I'm five foot 10 and I can feel my

110
00:11:50.011 --> 00:11:52.740
hair touch the roof of this. So it's.

111
00:11:54.130 --> 00:11:58.390
<v 2>About six feet roughly, maybe five 11. Cause I'm right at the top almost.</v>

112
00:11:59.020 --> 00:12:03.850
So look how small that door looks at the whole

113
00:12:06.070 --> 00:12:08.050
All bedrock except for the ceiling. As you just heard.

114
00:12:34.900 --> 00:12:35.290
<v 1>[Inaudible].</v>

115
00:12:35.290 --> 00:12:38.140
<v 2>And is this built this? So this was placing and that's sitting on that.</v>

116
00:12:51.970 --> 00:12:54.460
<v 4>[Inaudible] Resonance.</v>

117
00:12:56.920 --> 00:12:57.760
<v 2>Smooth as hell.</v>

118
00:13:08.500 --> 00:13:09.333
<v 4>[Inaudible].</v>

119
00:13:38.770 --> 00:13:39.603
<v 1>[Inaudible].</v>

120
00:14:33.370 --> 00:14:34.540
<v 2>So this goes down,</v>

121
00:14:35.020 --> 00:14:38.890
that goes to the other second entrance or exit higher up.

122
00:14:39.580 --> 00:14:41.500
All of this is carved out of solid bedrock.

123
00:14:47.380 --> 00:14:48.213
<v 1>[Inaudible].</v>

124
00:14:48.790 --> 00:14:53.390
<v 2>Yeah, the pyramid has a air. So the agent's work dance. As you can tell</v>

125
00:14:57.200 --> 00:14:58.033
this whole bedrock.

126
00:15:02.180 --> 00:15:03.013
<v 1>[Inaudible].</v>

127
00:15:03.590 --> 00:15:06.260
<v 2>And now this is small. This is very small.</v>

128
00:15:11.540 --> 00:15:15.350
As you can see, these steps were added in always, you would just be fleshed,

129
00:15:15.351 --> 00:15:19.970
bedrock. This is about three feet or so lie. I'm scrapped.

130
00:15:20.210 --> 00:15:23.600
I'm crouched down. It's uncomfortable.

131
00:15:29.060 --> 00:15:29.893
Then it opens

132
00:15:35.470 --> 00:15:39.770
And now it's I'm five foot 10 and it's got a few inches on me.

133
00:15:46.280 --> 00:15:50.000
This goes down to the subterranean. What would they call it? Queen's chamber.

134
00:15:55.160 --> 00:15:55.993
As you can see block

135
00:16:16.520 --> 00:16:21.380
That goes up probably 10 feet, 11 feet.

136
00:16:21.381 --> 00:16:22.214
Just a guess.

137
00:16:33.080 --> 00:16:35.870
So we went down and now we go back up and that's the exit,

138
00:16:36.260 --> 00:16:39.200
but that's at ground level. And so that is a,

139
00:16:39.380 --> 00:16:42.530
I think it's 26 degree angle if I remember. Right. And it says,

140
00:16:42.531 --> 00:16:47.180
what is in the great pyramid? Oh yeah. Oh,

141
00:16:47.190 --> 00:16:50.030
you guys waiting for me? Perfect. Here we go.

142
00:16:50.830 --> 00:16:54.260
And the way I hope my narration isn't annoying.

143
00:16:54.980 --> 00:16:59.690
If I post this on Instagram, you guys can forget anything Christmas.

144
00:17:00.620 --> 00:17:02.900
Oh, okay. See, even my back just hit the, the roof.

145
00:17:03.170 --> 00:17:06.320
Like this is much smaller than the camera's showing.

146
00:17:10.730 --> 00:17:14.330
This is shot on an iPhone 12 pro wide angled.

147
00:17:14.480 --> 00:17:19.400
It's on set on ultra wide 0.5 X right now, just for frame of reference.

148
00:17:19.460 --> 00:17:20.450
So going to know the ones

149
00:17:24.950 --> 00:17:26.090
We're entering outside.

150
00:17:31.430 --> 00:17:35.180
Oh, thank you. That was, I'll never forget that. Thank you.

151
00:17:42.680 --> 00:17:43.940
Yes, please.
