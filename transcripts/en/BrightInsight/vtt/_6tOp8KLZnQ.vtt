00:00:00.980 --> 00:00:04.200
<v 0>Hey everybody. This is Jimmy with bright insight. All right guys,</v>

2
00:00:04.201 --> 00:00:05.880
look at these photos. No,

3
00:00:05.940 --> 00:00:08.960
you were not showing these photos when you were growing up in school and neither

4
00:00:08.961 --> 00:00:10.960
was I, and by the way, no,

5
00:00:10.961 --> 00:00:14.600
they're not showing these types of photographs in the textbooks that our

6
00:00:14.720 --> 00:00:18.640
children are actively being taught today in the public school system,

7
00:00:18.820 --> 00:00:21.630
as well as people at the university, the level. Now,

8
00:00:21.631 --> 00:00:25.750
what you're seeing here are various stone structures carved out of rose granite,

9
00:00:26.090 --> 00:00:29.030
as well as bass salt. Now, just to put this in perspective,

10
00:00:29.240 --> 00:00:34.070
these types of stone materials cannot be cut and carved with the

11
00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:38.110
materials that we know that the diagnostic Egyptians had. For example,

12
00:00:38.410 --> 00:00:40.950
you need steel to cut these types of stone material.

13
00:00:41.360 --> 00:00:42.660
And later in the presentation,

14
00:00:42.760 --> 00:00:45.060
I'm gonna show you what's called the moose scale of hardness.

15
00:00:45.330 --> 00:00:49.380
That basically details the hardness of level of different types of stones.

16
00:00:49.640 --> 00:00:53.260
So for example, rose granite, which you're seeing here is a seven outta 10.

17
00:00:53.560 --> 00:00:57.460
You need steel to cut that basalt is approximately a six and a half.

18
00:00:58.070 --> 00:01:02.690
There is no way that the diagnostic Egyptians were able to cut and carve

19
00:01:02.860 --> 00:01:07.050
these types of materials, utilizing the bronze chisels that they,

20
00:01:07.070 --> 00:01:10.130
we know that they had, or the do right hammers,

21
00:01:10.131 --> 00:01:13.690
that we also know that they were using. So those mat, I mean,

22
00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:17.370
and besides that fact look at the precision. Now,

23
00:01:17.371 --> 00:01:19.970
if you were to use a bronze chisel on these types of materials,

24
00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:23.640
it would be like the equivalent of trying to, uh,

25
00:01:23.730 --> 00:01:28.040
shape and cut wood with wood. It's just not gonna work.

26
00:01:28.041 --> 00:01:32.000
And when you look at the incredible accuracy of these,

27
00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:36.640
of these structures and the right angles, as well as the circular drill bits,

28
00:01:36.790 --> 00:01:41.760
like how do you cut circles like that through solid stone through rows

29
00:01:41.761 --> 00:01:44.630
granite? Do you know how hard that is? A seven outta 10 on the most scale?

30
00:01:45.550 --> 00:01:45.951
I mean, guys,

31
00:01:45.951 --> 00:01:49.270
you know how hard grant it is not knock on your countertops with your,

32
00:01:49.430 --> 00:01:51.190
with your bare knuckles and let me know what that feels like.

33
00:01:51.490 --> 00:01:52.910
And as you look through these photos,

34
00:01:53.010 --> 00:01:56.950
you have definitive evidence that there is some sort of lost ancient high

35
00:01:56.951 --> 00:02:01.310
technology or machining that was utilized to cut these stones.

36
00:02:01.311 --> 00:02:02.350
There's no other way.

37
00:02:02.380 --> 00:02:07.020
There's no a way that they were using stone hammers from do right

38
00:02:07.400 --> 00:02:10.860
to make these types of cuts. It's just not possible.

39
00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:13.660
And you could see the definitive evidence where there,

40
00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:17.060
you could see the actual lines where the, the,

41
00:02:17.380 --> 00:02:21.340
the steps and the recut surfaces and the angle cuts of the sauce like, hello,

42
00:02:21.341 --> 00:02:24.570
that's these are clearly saw. Hello.

43
00:02:25.610 --> 00:02:29.250
Did they have that type of machine machinery back in, uh, the dynastic Egyptian,

44
00:02:29.410 --> 00:02:33.050
uh, time? Uh, no, we know that they didn't guys, this is common sense.

45
00:02:33.430 --> 00:02:35.450
The evidence is right in front of us,

46
00:02:35.750 --> 00:02:39.610
and there is an active attempt to keep this under wraps. Because again,

47
00:02:39.611 --> 00:02:41.890
they're not putting this, uh, type of information in textbooks,

48
00:02:42.390 --> 00:02:46.920
but we now have hundreds of geologists in stone masons throughout the world that

49
00:02:46.921 --> 00:02:48.360
are doing active demonstrations.

50
00:02:48.361 --> 00:02:51.120
And you can find these videos on YouTube by the way. And, and by the way,

51
00:02:51.121 --> 00:02:52.320
real quick, special,

52
00:02:52.321 --> 00:02:55.200
thanks to Google images and everyone that put these images on there,

53
00:02:55.360 --> 00:02:57.200
cuz that's where I source these images. So thank you.

54
00:02:57.220 --> 00:02:58.920
I'm utilizing them to help teach you guys things,

55
00:02:59.540 --> 00:03:02.520
but there are people throughout the world, including John Anthony, west,

56
00:03:02.521 --> 00:03:07.200
Robert shock, Brian Forrester, um, uh, Graham Hancock,

57
00:03:07.480 --> 00:03:09.800
Randall Carson, and many others that are actively talking about this.

58
00:03:10.020 --> 00:03:11.560
But you also have professional stone,

59
00:03:11.561 --> 00:03:15.960
masons and geologists that are showing you videos, trying to recreate and, and,

60
00:03:16.060 --> 00:03:20.790
and carve these types of stone structure out of what the dynastic

61
00:03:20.791 --> 00:03:23.630
Egyptians have. And they're, they're laughing. They're saying it's not possible.

62
00:03:23.780 --> 00:03:26.750
There's no way in what we're actively being told.

63
00:03:26.930 --> 00:03:28.750
And we're taught and is still being taught in.

64
00:03:28.751 --> 00:03:33.070
The education system does not account for how these types of structures were

65
00:03:33.071 --> 00:03:37.030
made. And you can see it right here with your own eyes. I mean,

66
00:03:37.031 --> 00:03:40.540
look at this like here's so here's photographs of, you know, the,

67
00:03:40.541 --> 00:03:42.980
these types of these tools, which I showed you before.

68
00:03:44.200 --> 00:03:47.340
How could they have done it? I mean, look at this stone box here, as an example,

69
00:03:47.410 --> 00:03:50.900
look at the precision on this. And it's completely unexplainable.

70
00:03:51.690 --> 00:03:55.620
Look at the circular drill holes. Look at these very unique, uh,

71
00:03:56.050 --> 00:04:01.010
cuts and, and carved scoop marks, uh, in this rose granite solid rose bedrock,

72
00:04:01.011 --> 00:04:04.170
granite. And I'll have another video on this regarding the OS,

73
00:04:04.410 --> 00:04:07.170
cuz that's where these, these were taken from the Aswan Curry in Egypt.

74
00:04:07.910 --> 00:04:11.610
But not to mention, I mean, look at these ginormous stone blocks,

75
00:04:11.750 --> 00:04:14.930
not just precision on them, but look how enormous they are.

76
00:04:14.931 --> 00:04:17.890
And we're talking 20, 30 tons on many of these.

77
00:04:18.270 --> 00:04:21.840
So it's not just how could they cut and carve them or move them.

78
00:04:22.380 --> 00:04:26.320
But how did they lift them? Do they have a crane? I mean,

79
00:04:26.321 --> 00:04:29.520
there's many different theories on how this was done, but they do not stand up.

80
00:04:29.521 --> 00:04:32.600
They get debunked in the, the theories that we were taught with, you know,

81
00:04:32.601 --> 00:04:37.480
these leather robes and 20,000 slaves do not do not account

82
00:04:37.780 --> 00:04:41.110
for the actual definitive evidence of that.

83
00:04:41.111 --> 00:04:45.790
<v 1>You can see here as well as drill, drill holes and not to mention these,</v>

84
00:04:46.230 --> 00:04:47.470
these circular, you know,

85
00:04:47.870 --> 00:04:52.310
oval type shapes that you can see right here in front of you where these

86
00:04:52.390 --> 00:04:56.030
concaves like, how do you, how could you get a bunch of stone, you know,

87
00:04:56.031 --> 00:04:59.390
hammers and make that type of shape? How could you even do that with a chisel,

88
00:04:59.620 --> 00:05:00.990
even with a steel chisel,

89
00:05:01.500 --> 00:05:04.700
I would say that you would not be able to grind it to that type of degree

90
00:05:04.770 --> 00:05:08.140
without some sort of advanced machinery look, guys,

91
00:05:08.280 --> 00:05:12.180
the evidence is right in front of us. You decide again, I'm Jimmy,

92
00:05:12.250 --> 00:05:14.940
this is bright inside. If you like what I have to say, I can subscribe.

93
00:05:15.020 --> 00:05:17.580
I have many more videos for you enjoy and many more to come,

94
00:05:17.810 --> 00:05:20.380
help me spread the message. Be blessed, all.
