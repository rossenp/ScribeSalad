00:00:00.970 --> 00:00:04.300
<v 0>What we were taught in school about the human migration process into north</v>

2
00:00:04.301 --> 00:00:07.540
America has been definitively debunked. In fact,

3
00:00:07.541 --> 00:00:11.100
our textbooks currently state that humans cross a frozen land bridge from

4
00:00:11.101 --> 00:00:14.340
Russia, just shy of 15,000 years ago. However,

5
00:00:14.480 --> 00:00:16.740
the evidence I'm about to share with you in this presentation,

6
00:00:17.260 --> 00:00:18.620
conclusively debunks,

7
00:00:18.621 --> 00:00:22.890
that now it was recently in now that Macedon bones found in San Diego,

8
00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:27.210
California dating back 130,000 years show

9
00:00:27.340 --> 00:00:30.090
definitive evidence of human tool marks.

10
00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:32.570
Now let me first address the issue of dating.

11
00:00:32.750 --> 00:00:37.130
How do they know it's 130,000 years old while utilizing advanced methods of

12
00:00:37.131 --> 00:00:37.520
dating.

13
00:00:37.520 --> 00:00:40.930
They've been able to measure the amount of uranium depletion and decay within

14
00:00:40.931 --> 00:00:43.000
these bones that turn into thorium.

15
00:00:43.420 --> 00:00:46.040
And what's surprising is that throughout mainstream science,

16
00:00:46.270 --> 00:00:50.560
they agree that yes. Okay. These bones are in fact 130,000 years old,

17
00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:54.640
which of course I was thrilled to hear because usually I disagree with much of

18
00:00:54.641 --> 00:00:57.800
what mainstream science has to say when it comes to the age of ancient human

19
00:00:57.801 --> 00:00:59.040
civilization and other things.

20
00:00:59.540 --> 00:01:02.910
So it's very interesting to see that there is a on that, yes,

21
00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:05.430
these bones are 130,000 years old.

22
00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:09.510
Now what makes this site even more interesting is that they found seven rounded

23
00:01:09.511 --> 00:01:13.550
stone hammers that have also been known to have been used to break up bones in

24
00:01:13.551 --> 00:01:17.830
Willie, Mamo and Macon by early hunters and gatherers in north America. Now,

25
00:01:17.831 --> 00:01:20.470
when these methods have been tested by researchers and paleontologists,

26
00:01:20.940 --> 00:01:24.060
they have utilized fresher remains of elephant femurs,

27
00:01:24.260 --> 00:01:27.900
and other various bones of elephants and broken them up with the various stone

28
00:01:27.901 --> 00:01:29.380
hammers found at these other sites.

29
00:01:29.720 --> 00:01:33.820
And they have found consistencies among these seven stone hammers found at the

30
00:01:34.300 --> 00:01:36.780
Macon site and that they have scratch marks on them,

31
00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:39.460
completely consistent with the other scratch marks.

32
00:01:39.461 --> 00:01:44.090
They have found on their own tests by utilizing stone hammers. Furthermore,

33
00:01:44.091 --> 00:01:48.010
they also identified that the stone hammers that cause fractures and splintering

34
00:01:48.011 --> 00:01:52.530
of the various bones and Macedon wooy Mamo and elephants are completely

35
00:01:52.531 --> 00:01:54.530
identical to one another. In fact,

36
00:01:54.531 --> 00:01:57.770
many people are involved in this study and have completely agreed that yes,

37
00:01:57.771 --> 00:02:00.330
these are actual definitive marks of human tooling.

38
00:02:00.590 --> 00:02:04.560
Now the big obstacle now among mainstream scientists is that they say, well,

39
00:02:04.590 --> 00:02:07.200
hold on, maybe this wasn't humans, maybe this was, you know,

40
00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:08.640
Neanderthals or something else,

41
00:02:08.970 --> 00:02:13.360
which I find to be incredibly hypocritical considering the lack of evidence of

42
00:02:13.361 --> 00:02:13.841
that. I mean,

43
00:02:13.841 --> 00:02:17.440
they're just suggesting something that they don't have any proof of. And, uh,

44
00:02:17.500 --> 00:02:19.400
you know, at all the things I've researched,

45
00:02:19.401 --> 00:02:22.880
it seems to me that mainstream science completely shuns arguments that involves

46
00:02:22.881 --> 00:02:23.714
speculation, right?

47
00:02:24.610 --> 00:02:28.590
So the agree that the skeleton remains of this Macedon is 130,000 years old.

48
00:02:29.170 --> 00:02:32.750
The agree that has definitive evidence of human tooling that far exceeds the

49
00:02:32.751 --> 00:02:36.630
possibility of just being crushed under natural circumstances yet,

50
00:02:36.830 --> 00:02:39.510
although some mainstream scientists are convinced that this is evidence of human

51
00:02:39.511 --> 00:02:41.150
tooling. Some will argue that well,

52
00:02:41.151 --> 00:02:44.030
there's not enough evidence yet to suggest that humans were actually north

53
00:02:44.031 --> 00:02:46.580
America 130,000 years ago. However,

54
00:02:46.610 --> 00:02:50.220
they seem to be completely ignoring all the recent evidence that accumulated in

55
00:02:50.221 --> 00:02:54.300
recent years involving connections between ancient Egyptians and the Inns in

56
00:02:54.301 --> 00:02:58.660
south America, as well as connections in north America as well. For example,

57
00:02:59.180 --> 00:03:03.880
are you aware that they have found Aboriginal DNA from Australia in mummies in

58
00:03:03.881 --> 00:03:04.714
south America?

59
00:03:05.110 --> 00:03:07.920
This is something that has just come out in the last year from studies that were

60
00:03:07.921 --> 00:03:11.800
done by Harvard medical school, but to make things even more confusing,

61
00:03:11.990 --> 00:03:16.160
they have found ancient remains in north American Indians that have middle

62
00:03:16.161 --> 00:03:19.190
Eastern DNA that's per incredible.

63
00:03:19.890 --> 00:03:21.670
And the evidence goes even further than that,

64
00:03:21.980 --> 00:03:26.470
they have actually found traces of nicotine and cocaine in mummies

65
00:03:26.500 --> 00:03:27.790
founded ancient Egypt,

66
00:03:28.200 --> 00:03:32.070
which is completely unexplainable considering that cocaine and nicotine

67
00:03:32.071 --> 00:03:35.310
originates from plants from meso America and south America.

68
00:03:35.970 --> 00:03:39.660
How in the world did ancient Egyptians have this in their blood streams then,

69
00:03:40.320 --> 00:03:42.100
but it doesn't even end there. In fact,

70
00:03:42.260 --> 00:03:45.420
let me show you some slides that I've had in other videos related to this topic

71
00:03:45.480 --> 00:03:48.980
of the connections between the ancients among various continents around the

72
00:03:48.981 --> 00:03:53.100
world, whether it's the incredible similarities between pyramids found in south

73
00:03:53.101 --> 00:03:56.420
America, central America, Egypt, Asia,

74
00:03:57.200 --> 00:04:00.730
or whether it comes from the incredible similarities between the stone cuttings

75
00:04:00.731 --> 00:04:03.370
found in Egypt, Italy, Turkey, Peru,

76
00:04:04.110 --> 00:04:08.890
or even the use of trapezoidal doors or the use of gold funeral masks

77
00:04:09.270 --> 00:04:13.170
or the depiction of the third eye, or even animals depicted on the forehead.

78
00:04:13.820 --> 00:04:17.570
Those are just a few examples of the connections between ancient cultures that

79
00:04:17.571 --> 00:04:21.240
span across multiple continents around the world. And it's pretty incredible.

80
00:04:21.400 --> 00:04:21.601
I mean,

81
00:04:21.601 --> 00:04:25.160
can you honestly say that this is all just a coincidence and with the recent

82
00:04:25.520 --> 00:04:29.560
evidence of 130,000 year old Macon bones with human tooling,

83
00:04:29.940 --> 00:04:33.280
you have to start asking some real questions. Now, many people will say, well,

84
00:04:33.281 --> 00:04:35.640
wait a second. If they were able to travel between the continents,

85
00:04:35.750 --> 00:04:38.440
where's the evidence, where's the, where's the boats. Now,

86
00:04:38.441 --> 00:04:41.950
let me give you the example of the Titanic and I this in other presentations as

87
00:04:41.951 --> 00:04:42.360
well,

88
00:04:42.360 --> 00:04:46.390
which is that you had 50,000 tons of steel and iron that have been under the

89
00:04:46.391 --> 00:04:50.990
ocean for 105 years. And more than 50% of it is completely disintegrated.

90
00:04:51.290 --> 00:04:52.550
Or even if you find, you know,

91
00:04:52.551 --> 00:04:57.550
cars or houses that are outside untouched by humans for decades and just

92
00:04:57.551 --> 00:05:01.300
left in the elements, the R will cave in the rust inside and out.

93
00:05:01.480 --> 00:05:04.860
And within a matter of just a few hundred years lb as if they were completely

94
00:05:04.861 --> 00:05:08.460
nonexistent altogether. So even if the ancients had say wood boats,

95
00:05:08.480 --> 00:05:11.900
do you really think there would be anything left of it after tens of thousands

96
00:05:11.901 --> 00:05:13.100
of years? Now,

97
00:05:13.101 --> 00:05:16.140
I do have other videos that discuss the cataly that there's overwhelming

98
00:05:16.500 --> 00:05:20.260
evidence that 13,000 years ago, and 11,600 years ago,

99
00:05:20.261 --> 00:05:21.500
there were two massive events.

100
00:05:21.580 --> 00:05:25.570
There were complete reset bun to human civilization. Definitely check those out.

101
00:05:26.280 --> 00:05:27.040
Anyways, guys,

102
00:05:27.040 --> 00:05:29.930
it's time that we start asking real questions about the true history of human

103
00:05:29.931 --> 00:05:32.370
civilization. And if you start digging into this subject,

104
00:05:32.590 --> 00:05:36.410
you'll see that we are far older and far more advanced than we were ever taught

105
00:05:36.411 --> 00:05:39.170
in school. Anyways, guys, I'll leave it at that. I'm Jimmy,

106
00:05:39.240 --> 00:05:41.610
this is bright insight like in subscribe, leave me a comment.

107
00:05:41.611 --> 00:05:42.880
Let me know what your thoughts are.

108
00:05:43.180 --> 00:05:46.080
And I have many more videos to come and a whole wide variety of topics.

109
00:05:46.550 --> 00:05:47.440
Take care, everybody.
