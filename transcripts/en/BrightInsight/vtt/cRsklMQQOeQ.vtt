00:00:00.830 --> 00:00:04.680
<v 0>This recently unearth statue in Egypt, that's allegedly 3000 years old.</v>

2
00:00:04.700 --> 00:00:08.760
And of Ramsey's the second is absolute evidence of a lost ancient high

3
00:00:08.761 --> 00:00:09.594
technology.

4
00:00:09.700 --> 00:00:14.000
And it's also evidence of the BS narrative that the Egyptologists and the

5
00:00:14.120 --> 00:00:17.200
minister of antiquities of Egypt continue to throw to the masses.

6
00:00:17.660 --> 00:00:18.760
Let me start with my first point,

7
00:00:18.761 --> 00:00:20.400
which is that they claim that's 3000 years old.

8
00:00:20.401 --> 00:00:24.550
<v 2>Okay. So they don't know that you cannot carbonate stone, but they say that, oh,</v>

9
00:00:24.551 --> 00:00:28.230
well, it's very likely to be of Ramsey's the second who lived 3000 years ago,

10
00:00:28.290 --> 00:00:29.990
so, okay. &lt;laugh&gt; well,

11
00:00:29.991 --> 00:00:33.830
really like what makes you think it's Ramsey's the second of Ramsey's whoever I

12
00:00:33.970 --> 00:00:36.670
do you see a face on this stone? I know, I sure don't. I mean,

13
00:00:36.671 --> 00:00:39.310
is there a name tag that I failed to read? Give me a break.

14
00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:44.020
What I see here is a broken statue with an elongated skull,

15
00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:45.500
which is really interesting,

16
00:00:45.740 --> 00:00:49.580
considering that most statues of Ramsey's Ramsey II, whoever do,

17
00:00:49.640 --> 00:00:51.140
do not have elongated skulls.

18
00:00:51.200 --> 00:00:52.780
<v 0>Now, a couple do that. I found through my search,</v>

19
00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:54.060
but then it raises the question, like,

20
00:00:54.061 --> 00:00:56.740
how do you know this is the same person it's ridiculous.

21
00:00:56.741 --> 00:01:00.100
Like these Egyptologists just throw names onto various statues and claim.

22
00:01:00.101 --> 00:01:01.890
They know who they were and when they lived &lt;affirmative&gt;,

23
00:01:02.270 --> 00:01:06.730
but they completely omit. The key fundamental aspect of this statue was,

24
00:01:06.731 --> 00:01:10.370
which is that it's made out of court site court site is a seven outta 10.

25
00:01:10.371 --> 00:01:12.770
On the most scale of hardness. Diamond is a 10.

26
00:01:13.310 --> 00:01:17.570
Now most statues in Egypt are made of basalt, which is a six outta 10.

27
00:01:17.830 --> 00:01:19.730
And then you have rose granite, which is commonly used,

28
00:01:19.731 --> 00:01:21.850
which is a six and a half outta 10 on the most scale.

29
00:01:22.540 --> 00:01:23.800
But court site exceeds that.

30
00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:27.840
And it must be mentioned that steel is what's used to cut these types of stones.

31
00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:32.160
Yet we know that the dynastic Egyptians did not have steel. They had bronze.

32
00:01:32.470 --> 00:01:34.640
Well, bronze is a combination of copper and tin.

33
00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:35.760
You can make it in your kitchen,

34
00:01:36.080 --> 00:01:40.760
probably any modern day stone Mason utilizes steel with diamond bit drills to

35
00:01:40.761 --> 00:01:45.470
cut quart site rose, granite. So that being said, how do the Egyptians do this?

36
00:01:45.730 --> 00:01:49.750
What's far more likely is that this statue predates the diagnostic Egyptians and

37
00:01:49.870 --> 00:01:54.510
is part of the civilization that was wiped out 12,980 years ago during the

38
00:01:54.511 --> 00:01:56.350
incredible cataly that happened here on earth.

39
00:01:56.510 --> 00:02:00.030
<v 2>I have a video about this. I mean, honestly, for them to just say that, oh,</v>

40
00:02:00.031 --> 00:02:03.030
it's 3000 years old. And if Ramsey's a second, like, are you joking?

41
00:02:03.640 --> 00:02:05.420
But you can't tell who it is. Now.

42
00:02:05.540 --> 00:02:08.980
I understand that certain aspects of the body are very similar to other statues

43
00:02:09.160 --> 00:02:09.661
in Egypt.

44
00:02:09.661 --> 00:02:12.540
So I'm not gonna sit here and tell you that the Egyptians did not make this,

45
00:02:12.760 --> 00:02:16.500
but if you really think that the scrub down quart site was sand for like a

46
00:02:16.501 --> 00:02:18.340
hundred years or whatever along it would take to do.

47
00:02:18.340 --> 00:02:20.820
<v 0>So, gimme a break. There's far more to this story.</v>

48
00:02:21.040 --> 00:02:24.410
And when you start connecting the dots and all the evidence for megalithic

49
00:02:24.570 --> 00:02:27.530
structures from around the world, not just Egypt, but from south America,

50
00:02:27.590 --> 00:02:28.930
Turkey all over the place,

51
00:02:29.310 --> 00:02:33.170
you'll see that there is absolute evidence of some sort of lost ancient high

52
00:02:33.171 --> 00:02:36.730
technology that was utilized to carve these stones. There's no other way.

53
00:02:36.990 --> 00:02:38.930
<v 2>Now look at these photos here. The statue is massive.</v>

54
00:02:39.240 --> 00:02:43.570
Even the piece of torso that they lifted out is three tons of it in itself. Now,

55
00:02:43.571 --> 00:02:45.640
how are they able to move, move something so heavy is one thing,

56
00:02:45.980 --> 00:02:49.960
but how they were able to cut and carve one solid piece of court site with the

57
00:02:50.080 --> 00:02:53.360
materials that we know that the dynastic Egyptians had clearly leaves an

58
00:02:53.600 --> 00:02:56.920
absolute gap in what the current textbooks have been stating for decades.

59
00:02:57.430 --> 00:02:59.520
It's quite literally evidence that the.

60
00:02:59.640 --> 00:03:03.200
<v 1>Textbooks are inaccurate and that there's far more to the story of ancient human</v>

61
00:03:03.201 --> 00:03:05.240
civilization than we're ever taught in school,

62
00:03:05.380 --> 00:03:08.640
or they're actively teaching today. Anyways, guys, I'll leave it at that.

63
00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:09.680
I can subscribe.

64
00:03:09.680 --> 00:03:13.240
I have many other videos on this topic and a whole other wide variety of topics

65
00:03:13.241 --> 00:03:16.560
as well. I'm Jimmy, this is bright insight. Take care of everybody.
