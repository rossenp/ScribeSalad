1
00:00:03.160 --> 00:00:07.650
<v 0>What you're looking at here is referred to as the unfinished Northern pyramid of</v>

2
00:00:07.810 --> 00:00:10.170
Z L Arion or the pyramid of Baca.

3
00:00:10.430 --> 00:00:13.410
And when I tell you what the Egyptian authorities have done to this site,

4
00:00:13.910 --> 00:00:17.330
you're gonna be really, really upset. So first of all,

5
00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:21.050
look at these incredible photos of something that you've never even seen or

6
00:00:21.051 --> 00:00:22.930
heard of before, at least not likely to have,

7
00:00:23.190 --> 00:00:27.120
because this has been off limits to tourists and any type of excavation,

8
00:00:27.121 --> 00:00:30.920
since it was placed around a military or within a military compound back in the

9
00:00:31.120 --> 00:00:34.600
1960s. Now, as you look at this giant corridor,

10
00:00:34.601 --> 00:00:39.440
which is more than 75 feet deep, this is carved out of not dirt, not sandstone,

11
00:00:39.700 --> 00:00:41.360
but solid limestone bedrock,

12
00:00:41.361 --> 00:00:45.830
which raises all kinds of questions on how the dynastic Egyptians could have

13
00:00:45.831 --> 00:00:50.030
done this because although, yes, the Egyptians did have bronze chisels,

14
00:00:50.031 --> 00:00:54.150
which can cut through limestone. It's unbelievably difficult,

15
00:00:54.170 --> 00:00:57.390
and it's not a practical use whatsoever because you're gonna wear down that

16
00:00:57.391 --> 00:01:00.150
bronze chisel or pick act. So unbelievably quick,

17
00:01:00.360 --> 00:01:04.030
which raises the question on why are we not finding hundreds, if not fat,

18
00:01:04.540 --> 00:01:06.300
thousands of discarded worn out bronze,

19
00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:11.300
chisels and pickaxes throughout ancient Egypt or this site, particularly now,

20
00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:12.263
first of all,

21
00:01:12.340 --> 00:01:15.460
let's just debunk the fact that it's being referred to as an unfinished pyramid,

22
00:01:16.210 --> 00:01:19.660
many of the mainstream claim that it was, although others have said, no,

23
00:01:19.661 --> 00:01:22.580
it's very likely that it wasn't a pyramid case in point, well,

24
00:01:22.581 --> 00:01:25.810
it's in the shape of a parallelogram. Find me one other pyramid,

25
00:01:26.210 --> 00:01:30.010
anywhere in the world that is in the shape of a parallelogram, not to mention,

26
00:01:30.490 --> 00:01:34.450
although other pyramids have the subterranean shafts, they're incredibly small.

27
00:01:34.670 --> 00:01:36.130
You can't even stand up within them.

28
00:01:36.150 --> 00:01:38.330
And this is clearly something completely different,

29
00:01:38.830 --> 00:01:43.610
but what makes this even more incredible is the size of the granite stones that

30
00:01:43.810 --> 00:01:48.240
were placed on the floor of this, uh, temple or a corridor. I mean, look,

31
00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:51.800
they refer to this as a tomb, as that this was a sarcophagus,

32
00:01:51.801 --> 00:01:55.880
as you see this oval type, well bathtub or sarcophagus. I mean,

33
00:01:55.881 --> 00:01:59.080
that's what they're referring to it as. I don't think that's what it was. And,

34
00:01:59.320 --> 00:02:01.280
and many others have suggested that it was something else,

35
00:02:01.281 --> 00:02:02.440
maybe something ceremonial,

36
00:02:02.650 --> 00:02:06.150
maybe some sort of site use to look at the cosmos and you know,

37
00:02:06.151 --> 00:02:08.150
who knows what tons of speculation.

38
00:02:08.151 --> 00:02:10.590
Nobody knows because there's no other site like it,

39
00:02:10.591 --> 00:02:14.550
there's no other sarcophagus in Egypt that is in the oval shape of this.

40
00:02:14.730 --> 00:02:17.990
And one of the things that makes this site so interesting besides the fact that

41
00:02:17.991 --> 00:02:22.310
it's dug 75 feet deep into solid limestone bedrock is that when you see these

42
00:02:22.410 --> 00:02:25.950
shaded flooring, uh, granite, uh, blocks on the flooring here,

43
00:02:26.560 --> 00:02:29.980
that's rose granite. So part of the site is regular granite,

44
00:02:30.080 --> 00:02:34.660
but those shaded parts are rose granite, which the closest site in Egypt,

45
00:02:34.661 --> 00:02:37.460
where these could have come from is from L 15 island,

46
00:02:37.570 --> 00:02:41.340
more than 500 miles away from the pyramids of Giza, which by the way,

47
00:02:41.341 --> 00:02:44.780
I almost forgot to mention this site is located approximately five miles

48
00:02:44.810 --> 00:02:46.580
Southwest of the pyramids of Giza.

49
00:02:46.790 --> 00:02:49.610
And when you consider just how massive these blocks are, I mean,

50
00:02:49.611 --> 00:02:52.810
we're talking 15 feet long, eight feet high, five feet wide,

51
00:02:53.070 --> 00:02:57.690
and then compare that to the 100 ton stone boxes found at the Sara outside of

52
00:02:57.700 --> 00:02:58.533
chiro Egypt.

53
00:02:58.590 --> 00:03:03.280
And we're talking 30 tons for the solid stone lid and 70 tons for the boxes.

54
00:03:03.640 --> 00:03:05.880
I mean, does anyone watching this have an estimate on how much,

55
00:03:05.881 --> 00:03:07.280
something like that would weigh? I mean,

56
00:03:07.281 --> 00:03:08.800
that could easily be a hundred tons of peace,

57
00:03:09.220 --> 00:03:13.040
but why would they go to such an incredible length to carry these massive stone

58
00:03:13.041 --> 00:03:16.240
blocks down this, uh, Causeway, which by the way,

59
00:03:16.260 --> 00:03:20.230
one of the stone blocks is a complete MIS because it's so large that they know

60
00:03:20.231 --> 00:03:24.150
it could not have made the corner once it got into this T-shaped, uh, area.

61
00:03:24.570 --> 00:03:26.030
So how did they bring it down there? I mean,

62
00:03:26.031 --> 00:03:29.550
obviously they must have lifted it down while it's being constructed. I mean,

63
00:03:29.700 --> 00:03:32.150
it's, it's one of the mysteries of this site. Now,

64
00:03:32.310 --> 00:03:36.070
the site was first excavated by an Italian archeologist in 1905.

65
00:03:36.130 --> 00:03:38.790
And as you see these photographs, they were taken in 19. Oh.

66
00:03:39.080 --> 00:03:41.060
And some of them were taken in 1921.

67
00:03:41.280 --> 00:03:45.700
And the only other pictures of this site since then is from 1954,

68
00:03:45.930 --> 00:03:49.820
when Hollywood paid a visit to this site to shoot it for a movie called the land

69
00:03:49.821 --> 00:03:51.740
of the pharaohs. And you could see it here,

70
00:03:51.741 --> 00:03:53.380
it's been digitally remastered into color.

71
00:03:53.600 --> 00:03:57.300
And these are all the photos that exist of the site, not since 1964,

72
00:03:57.400 --> 00:04:01.130
has anyone been allowed to visit it? Because it now within a military compound,

73
00:04:01.520 --> 00:04:04.010
tourism is prohibited. Archeologists,

74
00:04:04.240 --> 00:04:08.130
excavations are completely prohibited and here's the part that's gonna make you

75
00:04:08.131 --> 00:04:08.964
really upset.

76
00:04:09.470 --> 00:04:14.290
So the Egyptian authorities have been utilizing this site as a local dump,

77
00:04:15.070 --> 00:04:19.090
no joke inside this military compound, they are throwing trash into it.

78
00:04:19.320 --> 00:04:21.720
They are allow the wind to carry the sands into it.

79
00:04:21.721 --> 00:04:24.840
So they don't have to utilize any type of heavy machinery to cover up the trash.

80
00:04:25.140 --> 00:04:27.880
And it's since been filled up and here you can see an aerial photo of what it

81
00:04:27.881 --> 00:04:30.080
looks like today, completely unrecognizable,

82
00:04:30.420 --> 00:04:32.160
and to quote some German archeologists,

83
00:04:32.900 --> 00:04:37.400
the status of the burial shaft is now uncertain and most likely disastrous

84
00:04:37.910 --> 00:04:41.750
guys, I'm not so sure this was a burial chain of any kind. I mean,

85
00:04:41.790 --> 00:04:44.750
I can't say it's not, I'm not gonna tell you it wasn't. I mean, how do I know,

86
00:04:45.370 --> 00:04:47.070
but there's something really odd about this.

87
00:04:47.090 --> 00:04:51.150
It almost looks like some sort of industrial grade something. I mean,

88
00:04:51.330 --> 00:04:54.910
why it's one thing to line the floor with granite blocks? I mean,

89
00:04:54.911 --> 00:04:58.990
why would they choose blocks that are so unbelievably massive, again, 15 feet,

90
00:04:58.991 --> 00:05:00.990
which is four and a half meters by eight feet,

91
00:05:01.060 --> 00:05:04.780
which is two point what five meters and by five feet in height or deep,

92
00:05:04.860 --> 00:05:08.140
I should say. And not to mention this, when you look at this, uh,

93
00:05:08.380 --> 00:05:11.020
oval sarcophagus or bathtub, whatever you wanna call it again,

94
00:05:11.500 --> 00:05:15.100
I think it was something else. What exactly? I have no idea.

95
00:05:15.300 --> 00:05:17.340
It just that when I look at this site and you gotta keep in mind,

96
00:05:17.341 --> 00:05:20.620
as you see this stone block here that was laid down horizontally,

97
00:05:20.640 --> 00:05:23.370
as they found it, they feel like it was part of something else.

98
00:05:23.440 --> 00:05:25.410
They have no idea if there was a roof to this structure,

99
00:05:25.710 --> 00:05:28.530
but there has been much debate within mainstream itself saying that, well,

100
00:05:28.531 --> 00:05:29.810
we just don't know what this was.

101
00:05:30.150 --> 00:05:32.930
And there's a lot of reason to suggest that maybe it wasn't a chamber or a

102
00:05:32.931 --> 00:05:36.050
burial chamber whatsoever. I mean, after all, when they found this site,

103
00:05:36.270 --> 00:05:40.090
the cover was sealed shut. And when they opened it, there was no body in it. So,

104
00:05:40.570 --> 00:05:41.403
I mean, come on, like,

105
00:05:41.470 --> 00:05:46.320
why is it that they haven't found a single tomb within any pyramid or this site

106
00:05:46.500 --> 00:05:48.720
yet there's something called the valley of the Kings,

107
00:05:48.721 --> 00:05:52.280
which is just loaded with incredible artifacts. And how many, I mean,

108
00:05:52.281 --> 00:05:54.600
how many Kings have you found in there? Dozens and dozens.

109
00:05:54.601 --> 00:05:56.880
And they keep finding new ones. So I don't know.

110
00:05:56.881 --> 00:06:00.160
There's just a big hole missing this story clearly. And keep in mind,

111
00:06:00.161 --> 00:06:03.360
they have found almost nothing in this site whatsoever. As you see here,

112
00:06:03.361 --> 00:06:06.000
these are just some inscriptions that they found on some tablets in there.

113
00:06:06.220 --> 00:06:09.960
And that's it. So besides the fact that the Egyptian authorities are clearly,

114
00:06:10.240 --> 00:06:11.800
I mean, you could call this a cover up. I mean,

115
00:06:11.830 --> 00:06:13.960
even literally not just figuratively, I mean,

116
00:06:13.961 --> 00:06:16.910
they're burying the site with trash. I mean, what does that out about?

117
00:06:16.911 --> 00:06:19.270
And this is something that's so incredible. I mean, again,

118
00:06:19.271 --> 00:06:22.870
when you look at these walls here, it is unbelievably deep. It's just,

119
00:06:22.900 --> 00:06:26.550
awe-inspiring on, how did they do this? Why did they do this now?

120
00:06:26.710 --> 00:06:27.950
I would never even heard of this.

121
00:06:28.050 --> 00:06:31.910
If it wasn't for this awesome YouTube channel run by a guy named Chuck and his

122
00:06:31.911 --> 00:06:34.390
YouTube channel is called C a 7, 8 65.

123
00:06:34.620 --> 00:06:36.310
I'll include a link here in the description.

124
00:06:36.610 --> 00:06:40.700
You need to go to this guy's channel and subscribe because he is literally

125
00:06:40.701 --> 00:06:43.620
digging through books and looking through information that nobody else is

126
00:06:43.621 --> 00:06:47.060
talking about, or people don't even realize exists. Absolutely.

127
00:06:47.061 --> 00:06:48.060
Check out this guy's channel.

128
00:06:48.160 --> 00:06:51.540
He has so many different videos on so many different topics within ancient

129
00:06:51.710 --> 00:06:54.340
Egypt. And I've just been incredibly inspired by this guy.

130
00:06:54.520 --> 00:06:55.860
So definitely check out Chuck's channel.

131
00:06:55.960 --> 00:06:57.770

133
00:07:01.251 --> 00:07:05.690
would've known otherwise. So check him out. Anyways, guys, look at these photos.

134
00:07:05.750 --> 00:07:07.490
Let me know what you think. I mean, honestly,

135
00:07:07.610 --> 00:07:10.050
I think we're looking at something just incredible.

136
00:07:10.150 --> 00:07:13.650
We have to really utilize our imaginations to think about what this may have

137
00:07:13.651 --> 00:07:15.650
been so many thousands of years ago.

138
00:07:15.830 --> 00:07:20.360
And we also have to open and entertain the possib that this dates pre cataly.

139
00:07:20.640 --> 00:07:20.841
I mean,

140
00:07:20.841 --> 00:07:23.640
there is evidence here that the dynastic Egyptians have visited the site and

141
00:07:23.641 --> 00:07:25.640
utilized it for something. But again,

142
00:07:25.940 --> 00:07:30.120
how do they cut and carve through solid limestone bedrock this deep into this

143
00:07:30.121 --> 00:07:30.954
precision?

144
00:07:31.020 --> 00:07:35.080
Why did they go to such incredible length to cut and carve and move granite

145
00:07:35.280 --> 00:07:39.470
stone blocks from far away as 500 miles. Just to line the flooring with this.

146
00:07:39.630 --> 00:07:43.750
I mean, and again, a oval sarcophagus or bathtub, whatever you wanna call it.

147
00:07:44.190 --> 00:07:46.750
I dunno, guys. I think we're looking at something absolutely incredible.

148
00:07:46.751 --> 00:07:48.110
That goes far beyond, well,

149
00:07:48.180 --> 00:07:51.710
what the mainstream archeologists and Egyptologists have been stating,

150
00:07:52.010 --> 00:07:54.590
and again, why on earth would they prevent tourism?

151
00:07:55.170 --> 00:07:59.900
Why would they prevent excavations? Why would they bury the site with trash?

152
00:08:00.430 --> 00:08:03.740
Think about that anyways, guys, I'll leave it at that. I'm Jimmy,

153
00:08:03.741 --> 00:08:04.700
this is bright insight.

154
00:08:04.780 --> 00:08:08.020
I can subscribe and I have many other videos to come and a whole wide variety of

155
00:08:08.021 --> 00:08:09.620
topics. Take care, everybody.
