00:00:02.200 --> 00:00:06.500
<v 1>Is it possible that ancient humans actually did live to be several hundred years</v>

2
00:00:06.560 --> 00:00:08.940
old or even thousands. And in some cases,

3
00:00:09.250 --> 00:00:12.100
tens of thousands of years of age now,

4
00:00:12.101 --> 00:00:16.780
before we just dismiss this as nonsense or mistranslation of historical text,

5
00:00:17.040 --> 00:00:18.700
or even just symbolism of something else,

6
00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:22.250
that's just consider where we are in 2017,

7
00:00:22.740 --> 00:00:25.610
we've been cloning animals for more than 20 years. In fact, Dolly,

8
00:00:25.611 --> 00:00:28.410
the sheep in 1996 was the first animal we ever cloned.

9
00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:31.770
And since then we've cloned at least 15 different species of animals,

10
00:00:31.771 --> 00:00:35.810
whether it be farm animals, monkeys, fish, all kinds of different animals.

11
00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:40.610
And we're even now cloning human organs on the backs of mice and in,

12
00:00:40.770 --> 00:00:43.880
in Petri dish, I mean, we're even cloning human hearts.

13
00:00:44.220 --> 00:00:46.880
And now that people are living longer than ever, I mean,

14
00:00:47.320 --> 00:00:49.200
where are we gonna be a few hundred years into the future?

15
00:00:49.600 --> 00:00:51.720
Assuming we don't destroy ourselves by then. I mean,

16
00:00:51.721 --> 00:00:55.640
think about how long our lifespans will be 3, 4, 500 years into the future.

17
00:00:56.120 --> 00:00:59.440
I mean, think about that. We have a bunch of nerds and laboratories right now,

18
00:00:59.441 --> 00:01:03.390
growing organs and Petri dishes. And I say nerds as a term of endearment,

19
00:01:03.410 --> 00:01:07.230
by the way. So what's to say what's possible. And what isn't, I mean,

20
00:01:07.330 --> 00:01:09.630
as of today, if you have a hundred thousand dollars,

21
00:01:09.730 --> 00:01:12.590
you can pay a company in South Korea to clone your dog.

22
00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:14.830
<v 2>So when the Sumerian techs,</v>

23
00:01:14.831 --> 00:01:18.110
which lists all kinds of really interesting information, I mean,

24
00:01:18.111 --> 00:01:22.230
somehow the Sumerians knew of the planets in our solar system and they knew that

25
00:01:22.390 --> 00:01:26.020
my ours was smaller than earth Jupiter, bigger than Saturn and Saturn,

26
00:01:26.021 --> 00:01:28.020
bigger than Uranus and so on. I mean,

27
00:01:28.021 --> 00:01:32.660
how did they know this thousands of years before any telescope allegedly ever

28
00:01:32.690 --> 00:01:37.220
existed yet they claim that their king gods live to be tens of thousands of

29
00:01:37.221 --> 00:01:38.300
years old, which of course,

30
00:01:38.301 --> 00:01:41.740
many people will dismiss as symbolism or nonsense or whatever,

31
00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:45.330
but that's not forget at how many different civilizations from across multiple

32
00:01:45.331 --> 00:01:49.250
continents around the world, all say the same thing, ancient Chinese text,

33
00:01:49.550 --> 00:01:54.330
Indian Persian, Greek Sumerian text from the Bible,

34
00:01:54.470 --> 00:01:58.610
all say the same thing that before the flood we live longer than we do now.

35
00:01:58.770 --> 00:02:00.610
<v 1>I mean, and now it's slowly going back up again.</v>

36
00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:04.440
So is it really outta the realm of possibility? Now? Lot of people will say,

37
00:02:04.600 --> 00:02:06.880
well, wait a second. If we were so technologically advanced,

38
00:02:06.881 --> 00:02:09.360
we would have proof where there would be more evidence of this laying around

39
00:02:09.361 --> 00:02:11.760
that we would find. Now let me use the example.

40
00:02:11.780 --> 00:02:13.480
And I've used this in other videos, of course,

41
00:02:13.481 --> 00:02:16.600
which is that of the Titanic 105 years ago,

42
00:02:16.970 --> 00:02:21.360
50,000 tons of steel and iron a boat that was more than 800 feet long

43
00:02:21.790 --> 00:02:23.000
sank to the bottom of the ocean.

44
00:02:23.260 --> 00:02:27.630
And now today it's more than halfway gone and just a few hundred more years will

45
00:02:27.631 --> 00:02:28.790
be completely nonexistent.

46
00:02:28.970 --> 00:02:31.550
And I've also used the example of cars and houses that say,

47
00:02:31.551 --> 00:02:35.630
if you leave a car outside unattended for several decades, it'll rust itself,

48
00:02:35.870 --> 00:02:38.830
straight through same thing with a house that if you leave it unattended,

49
00:02:38.880 --> 00:02:40.950
it'll collapse in, on itself in a matter of decades.

50
00:02:41.770 --> 00:02:44.860
So when we're talking about a length of time of tens of thousands of the years,

51
00:02:45.160 --> 00:02:47.740
that's not forget that nothing survives other than stone.

52
00:02:48.280 --> 00:02:50.300
So any evidence that would be looking for is, well,

53
00:02:50.570 --> 00:02:54.740
it's gone now and not to mention if the most advanced civilizations at,

54
00:02:55.140 --> 00:02:58.780
in ancient civilization lived on the coastline as they do today. Well,

55
00:02:58.781 --> 00:03:02.160
what would happen with a 400 foot rise in sea level? I mean, it's all gone,

56
00:03:02.161 --> 00:03:02.940
right?

57
00:03:02.940 --> 00:03:06.400
Is it possible that ancient humans were once so advanced that they were able to

58
00:03:06.420 --> 00:03:11.400
repair their DNA and grow new organs and able to live to be 900 years old or a

59
00:03:11.560 --> 00:03:13.920
thousand, or even tens of thousands of years old? I mean,

60
00:03:14.050 --> 00:03:16.560
we're at the point now they say that in just a few years,

61
00:03:16.570 --> 00:03:19.870
we'll be cloning our first woo ammo, literally.

62
00:03:19.970 --> 00:03:22.590
And they're even talking about how long it'll be before we clone the first

63
00:03:22.600 --> 00:03:25.510
human, which I suspect has already happened. I mean,

64
00:03:25.511 --> 00:03:27.870
think about it countries like North Korea or China,

65
00:03:28.130 --> 00:03:31.870
or even the deep state intelligence agencies with the United States. I mean,

66
00:03:31.871 --> 00:03:33.550
come on, they've probably already done it already.

67
00:03:33.620 --> 00:03:36.990
It's disturbing to think about, but this is the world we live in.

68
00:03:36.991 --> 00:03:39.580
You think that scientists somewhere haven't gone rogue ride that out.

69
00:03:40.770 --> 00:03:44.540
It's time we start entertaining new questions because obviously following the

70
00:03:44.541 --> 00:03:48.860
last cataly that happened approximately 11,613,000 years ago,

71
00:03:49.100 --> 00:03:51.300
a dual event of discussed this in numerous videos.

72
00:03:51.850 --> 00:03:54.020
That obviously it would be a reset button for everything.

73
00:03:54.240 --> 00:03:56.620
We would lack any type of evidence of it anyways.

74
00:03:57.240 --> 00:04:00.930
So what are the odds that you would have new numerous civilizations across

75
00:04:01.250 --> 00:04:04.970
multiple continents, all saying the same thing. Maybe there is some truth to it,

76
00:04:05.190 --> 00:04:07.090
and we're obviously heading in that direction. Again,

77
00:04:07.260 --> 00:04:08.610
we're living to be longer than ever.

78
00:04:08.760 --> 00:04:12.530
They say that the first 150 year old people are already alive and driving around

79
00:04:12.540 --> 00:04:13.570
today. I mean,

80
00:04:13.571 --> 00:04:16.610
there's even legends and stories that people have lived to be 150 years old

81
00:04:16.611 --> 00:04:18.610
already, but they weren't able to verify it.

82
00:04:18.710 --> 00:04:22.120
So of course the Guinness spoke of records. Never took it into consideration.

83
00:04:22.590 --> 00:04:23.280
Anyways, guys,

84
00:04:23.280 --> 00:04:26.360
I wanna make this video just to get it out there and get people thinking because

85
00:04:26.740 --> 00:04:30.000
you know, something that I used to think was just ridiculous or silly symbolism.

86
00:04:30.240 --> 00:04:30.441
I mean,

87
00:04:30.441 --> 00:04:33.240
it wasn't until just a few months ago that I started actually thinking about

88
00:04:33.241 --> 00:04:35.360
that. You know, maybe there's some truth to this. I mean,

89
00:04:35.361 --> 00:04:38.720
history does repeat itself, right? Anyways, guys, I'll leave it at that,

90
00:04:38.750 --> 00:04:41.670
like in subscribe and leave me a comment. Let me know what your thoughts are,

91
00:04:41.970 --> 00:04:43.750
but I'm Jimmy, this is bright insight.

92
00:04:43.950 --> 00:04:47.310
I have many other videos to come and a whole wide variety of topics. Take care,

93
00:04:47.311 --> 00:04:47.710
everybody.
