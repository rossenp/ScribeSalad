00:00:02.840 --> 00:00:03.520
<v 0>Last week,</v>

2
00:00:03.520 --> 00:00:07.450
virtually every media outlet from around the world reported on the newly

3
00:00:07.610 --> 00:00:10.130
discovered void inside the great pyramid of Giza,

4
00:00:10.770 --> 00:00:15.010
a massive chamber discovered through particle physics and muan technology,

5
00:00:15.520 --> 00:00:19.970
approximately 100 feet or 30 meters in length and about 26 feet high.

6
00:00:20.910 --> 00:00:23.520
But in this video, I'm gonna discuss something of bit different,

7
00:00:23.810 --> 00:00:28.360
which is the completely unusual reaction from the two most leading authorities

8
00:00:28.420 --> 00:00:32.040
on Egyptology and archeology. Take for example,

9
00:00:32.320 --> 00:00:35.480
mark Laneer and Zahi Hawa. Well, let's start with mark Laneer,

10
00:00:35.660 --> 00:00:39.880
who said two things that completely contradicted the press briefing on behalf of

11
00:00:39.881 --> 00:00:44.150
scan pyramids. He stated that one, this void is an incline,

12
00:00:44.151 --> 00:00:48.630
so it's likely to not have any type of burial or any type of artifacts inside of

13
00:00:48.631 --> 00:00:49.170
it.

14
00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:53.230
And he also theorized that it was likely to be a structural support necessary to

15
00:00:53.231 --> 00:00:56.110
keep weight off the grand gallery. But wait a second,

16
00:00:56.380 --> 00:01:00.630
this completely contradicts what the president and co-founder of heritage

17
00:01:00.631 --> 00:01:02.550
innovation preservation Institute,

18
00:01:02.551 --> 00:01:04.860
which of course oversees the G pyramids project.

19
00:01:06.040 --> 00:01:10.940
His name is Medi Tai and he specifically states that they have no idea if

20
00:01:10.941 --> 00:01:13.580
this void is horizontal or inclined.

21
00:01:14.200 --> 00:01:18.220
And also the engineers overseeing this project have completely ruled out the

22
00:01:18.221 --> 00:01:22.500
possibility that this void has any type of purpose involving the structural

23
00:01:22.501 --> 00:01:24.180
integrity of the pyramid itself.

24
00:01:25.030 --> 00:01:28.170
So here you have mark Laneer doing interviews with the BBC,

25
00:01:28.230 --> 00:01:31.250
the New York times and other media outlets from around the world,

26
00:01:31.790 --> 00:01:35.450
but did he even read or watch the press briefing?

27
00:01:35.451 --> 00:01:37.130
Did he even look at any of the information?

28
00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:40.850
He immediately starts doing interviews and contradicts the actual facts that

29
00:01:40.851 --> 00:01:44.010
were presented in this find? I mean, where is his due diligence?

30
00:01:44.810 --> 00:01:48.600
Mark Lane is the director of ancient Egypt research association.

31
00:01:48.980 --> 00:01:52.560
And his works are cited in virtually every textbook and the subject of the

32
00:01:52.561 --> 00:01:56.680
pyramids and the Finks around the world. And then you have Zahi Hawa,

33
00:01:57.100 --> 00:01:59.240
the form of minister of antiquities for Egypt,

34
00:01:59.740 --> 00:02:02.120
who was of course fired for a variety of reasons.

35
00:02:02.580 --> 00:02:05.240
And then just a few years later was implicated in a,

36
00:02:05.710 --> 00:02:09.590
the theft of ancient relics from pyramids and got off the hook because of his

37
00:02:09.591 --> 00:02:11.670
connections and inside corruption.

38
00:02:11.820 --> 00:02:16.270
This is the same guy who has completely refused to acknowledge or even discuss

39
00:02:16.970 --> 00:02:19.430
the water erosion around the enclosure of the Finks.

40
00:02:19.700 --> 00:02:22.390
He's also refused to discuss the site of go Beckley Tepe,

41
00:02:23.130 --> 00:02:27.100
and he has some really unusual reactions to this new newly discovered void in

42
00:02:27.101 --> 00:02:28.820
the great pyramid quote.

43
00:02:29.410 --> 00:02:32.780
This paper offers nothing to Egyptology zero.

44
00:02:33.480 --> 00:02:37.260
He even referred to the individuals involved as propaganda and saying that they

45
00:02:37.261 --> 00:02:39.820
were wrong to call their findings a new discovery.

46
00:02:40.520 --> 00:02:44.180
And this is where things get a bit more interesting because he goes on to state

47
00:02:44.181 --> 00:02:47.130
that Egyptologists and archeologists have known for you years about the

48
00:02:47.131 --> 00:02:50.050
existence of several spaces inside the great pyramid.

49
00:02:50.710 --> 00:02:52.210
And mark Laneer said something similar,

50
00:02:52.260 --> 00:02:55.530
where he told the New York times that the great pyramid is like Swiss cheese

51
00:02:55.531 --> 00:02:59.720
rather than cheddar. And saying that this void is most likely no big deal.

52
00:03:00.110 --> 00:03:00.943
Wait a second.

53
00:03:01.780 --> 00:03:06.720
So a void that has remarkable similarities to that of the grand gallery is no

54
00:03:06.721 --> 00:03:07.460
big deal,

55
00:03:07.460 --> 00:03:10.880
but what's with this analogy of Swiss cheese and these many other voids that

56
00:03:10.881 --> 00:03:12.360
they've known about. I mean,

57
00:03:12.380 --> 00:03:14.840
can you show me some publications that mention all these voids?

58
00:03:14.841 --> 00:03:16.040
I only know of one other one,

59
00:03:16.290 --> 00:03:19.230
which was discovered two years ago through scan and pyramids,

60
00:03:19.250 --> 00:03:23.110
and you can see it here mentioned in the same discovery as this massive void,

61
00:03:23.260 --> 00:03:27.630
same company, same organization. And two years ago down to almost the day,

62
00:03:27.700 --> 00:03:31.590
they still haven't drilled into it. And by they, the Egyptian authorities,

63
00:03:31.830 --> 00:03:35.670
I mean, how long does it take to drill a hole to make the decision to do so?

64
00:03:36.010 --> 00:03:37.230
And they just sitting on this,

65
00:03:37.500 --> 00:03:40.860
they've known that there's been a void in the great pyramid for more than two

66
00:03:40.861 --> 00:03:43.580
years, and they've done nothing about it. Don't you find that interesting.

67
00:03:43.760 --> 00:03:46.420
The reason why you should find that interesting is because there's already

68
00:03:46.421 --> 00:03:49.060
examples of a coverup where the Egyptian authorities,

69
00:03:49.061 --> 00:03:53.420
including Zahi have done research inside the great pyramid of Giza without the

70
00:03:53.421 --> 00:03:56.100
public's knowledge and lied about it. Take for example,

71
00:03:56.280 --> 00:04:01.090
the 1993 versus 2002 research of this small tunnel shaft

72
00:04:01.190 --> 00:04:04.770
inside the great pyramid where after the Egyptian authorities,

73
00:04:04.930 --> 00:04:09.090
since Iwas had said that no one had been in there ever since when they revisited

74
00:04:09.091 --> 00:04:12.370
the site, nine years later, the two handles were broken and missing.

75
00:04:13.030 --> 00:04:16.250
And clearly there's some, they had gone in there. This is be honest,

76
00:04:16.480 --> 00:04:19.610
they did their own research and they found some reason to lie about it.

77
00:04:20.540 --> 00:04:21.373
What's that about?

78
00:04:21.500 --> 00:04:24.600
But let me keep going because the evidence actually gets more disturbing.

79
00:04:24.860 --> 00:04:28.960
Why would mark Laneer and ZAWA be so dismissive of this new find, well,

80
00:04:28.961 --> 00:04:29.800
you may not be aware,

81
00:04:30.100 --> 00:04:34.000
but four days prior to the November 2nd press release of the newly discovered

82
00:04:34.001 --> 00:04:38.400
void mark Laneer and ZAWA release their new book that they co-wrote together

83
00:04:38.500 --> 00:04:41.990
titled the definitive history Giza and the pyramids.

84
00:04:41.990 --> 00:04:43.710
And that was released on October 29th.

85
00:04:44.050 --> 00:04:47.750
And when you consider the obvious fact that mark Laneer had no idea of the

86
00:04:47.751 --> 00:04:50.710
information that was presented at press release prior,

87
00:04:50.930 --> 00:04:55.110
he was obviously left outta the loop and CMAA who condemned these people as

88
00:04:55.111 --> 00:04:56.910
propaganda and said that he should be more involved.

89
00:04:57.880 --> 00:05:01.780
Maybe just maybe their book doesn't contain any of the information at all these

90
00:05:01.910 --> 00:05:06.580
voids, this cheddar, this Swiss cheese analogy. I haven't read the book,

91
00:05:07.240 --> 00:05:09.180
but can anyone answer and leave a comment,

92
00:05:09.290 --> 00:05:12.180
whether they mention anything about these multiple voids or if they just

93
00:05:12.181 --> 00:05:15.700
mentioned that one, which of course was covered from two years ago?

94
00:05:16.450 --> 00:05:19.180
What about the rest? Because this seems to be new to me. I mean,

95
00:05:19.200 --> 00:05:22.530
did I miss the memo was this mentioned in some text book about all these other

96
00:05:22.580 --> 00:05:25.850
voids. I mean, it doesn't seem like the public or there's any information,

97
00:05:25.870 --> 00:05:30.090
or can someone provide a publication from anything written from Zhi was,

98
00:05:30.290 --> 00:05:33.610
or mark Laneer including this book or anywhere else. Hmm.

99
00:05:33.790 --> 00:05:38.530
Now if you think I'm reaching on the suppression and cover up of information

100
00:05:38.630 --> 00:05:42.640
and knowledge from the masses on behalf of these mainstream Egypt and

101
00:05:42.641 --> 00:05:46.640
archeologists, well take just one example of that, of the great Finks.

102
00:05:46.700 --> 00:05:49.320
And I made a video on this, the link of the end of the video, of course,

103
00:05:49.780 --> 00:05:54.040
but mark Laneer was the first to excavate the tunnels underneath the Finks.

104
00:05:54.041 --> 00:05:56.280
And this was in the seventies. And then he,

105
00:05:56.580 --> 00:06:01.360
and ZAWA had denied the existence of these tunnels for decades until ZAWA

106
00:06:01.361 --> 00:06:04.080
eventually admitted it and said, well, these don't go anywhere.

107
00:06:04.081 --> 00:06:05.880
There's nothing down there. And as you can see here,

108
00:06:06.310 --> 00:06:07.920
they never even show you one picture,

109
00:06:08.100 --> 00:06:12.440
not one video exists at all of these hidden chambers and tunnels that do indeed

110
00:06:12.441 --> 00:06:14.360
exist under this FIS. I mean,

111
00:06:14.361 --> 00:06:17.590
to change your stories and deny it and not to have one picture of video and

112
00:06:17.591 --> 00:06:20.710
existence of these tunnels, guys connect the dots on this,

113
00:06:20.770 --> 00:06:24.150
but it gets even worse. Mark Laneer, even though he himself,

114
00:06:24.151 --> 00:06:26.110
and you could see in videos, and I have a video on this too,

115
00:06:26.130 --> 00:06:30.950
the link will be at the end where every single example of how the ancient

116
00:06:30.951 --> 00:06:34.750
Egyptians or at least the theories of how they cut and carve stone has been

117
00:06:34.751 --> 00:06:35.830
ultimately debunked.

118
00:06:35.831 --> 00:06:40.020
And this all ties back and to the theories that the great pyramid of Giza was

119
00:06:40.021 --> 00:06:42.900
built prior to the cataly of 12,000 years ago.

120
00:06:43.120 --> 00:06:46.780
But the information is there that strongly suggests that the great pyramid of

121
00:06:46.781 --> 00:06:50.820
Giza was something far more advanced, sophisticated, and technologically based.

122
00:06:51.120 --> 00:06:53.860
And the authorities that oversee these sites know about it.

123
00:06:54.040 --> 00:06:58.090
And it's time that we start asking new questions and that the heart up this

124
00:06:58.091 --> 00:07:02.090
stupid process and drill the holes into these chambers to see what is in there,

125
00:07:02.380 --> 00:07:05.450
drill a three millimeter or one inch hole they've already discussed doing it

126
00:07:05.451 --> 00:07:06.570
because where it stands right now,

127
00:07:06.720 --> 00:07:09.530
they say they wanna spend the next couple years having archeologists and

128
00:07:09.531 --> 00:07:10.690
Egyptologists from around the world,

129
00:07:11.610 --> 00:07:15.970
consider and debate and discuss what this void might be. Shut up,

130
00:07:16.180 --> 00:07:19.200
drill the fricking hole, stick a camera in there and find out.

131
00:07:19.900 --> 00:07:23.040
But when you look at what happened between 1993 and 2002, well,

132
00:07:23.041 --> 00:07:26.920
something just tells me that the authorities that do run the show wanna see

133
00:07:26.921 --> 00:07:30.240
first. So it makes you wonder what's really going on there,

134
00:07:30.241 --> 00:07:33.840
but I'll close up there. I'm Jimmy, this is bright insight. I can subscribe,

135
00:07:33.841 --> 00:07:36.480
leave me a comment. And as you can see, I got a new place.

136
00:07:36.640 --> 00:07:40.070
I got a new like moved and this studio I'll have to make a video about that.

137
00:07:40.430 --> 00:07:43.950
&lt;laugh&gt; so this will all be changing as I make upgrades as we go. But anyways,

138
00:07:43.980 --> 00:07:44.711
I'll close up there.

139
00:07:44.711 --> 00:07:47.630
Check out the videos that are linked here and take care of everybody. All.
