00:00:05.740 --> 00:00:10.720
<v 0>The burning of the library of Alexandria certainly ranks among the worst crimes</v>

2
00:00:10.950 --> 00:00:12.400
ever committed against humanity.

3
00:00:13.060 --> 00:00:16.920
And it is widely believed that the losses of scientific research,

4
00:00:16.921 --> 00:00:18.600
including that of physics and medicine,

5
00:00:19.100 --> 00:00:23.200
as well as the losses of cultural and historical knowledge and documentation

6
00:00:24.200 --> 00:00:28.110
set back the progress of civilization by at least a thousand years.

7
00:00:29.090 --> 00:00:30.030
Now, if you're not familiar,

8
00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:33.870
the library of Alexandria was located in Alexandria, Egypt,

9
00:00:33.871 --> 00:00:35.830
which was by the way, named after Alexander.

10
00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:39.950
The great and is believed to have been burnt down by Julius Caesar in the year

11
00:00:39.951 --> 00:00:43.630
48 BC. However, this is the subject of much debate.

12
00:00:43.870 --> 00:00:45.630
And I'll get into that later in this video. Now,

13
00:00:45.631 --> 00:00:47.980
the library of Alexandria was more than just a library.

14
00:00:48.320 --> 00:00:50.060
It was a research center. In fact,

15
00:00:50.061 --> 00:00:54.020
you could even credit it for being the first model, essentially of a university.

16
00:00:54.200 --> 00:00:54.621
In fact,

17
00:00:54.621 --> 00:00:59.580
it even had the world's first medical school and it existed for almost 700 years

18
00:00:59.950 --> 00:01:01.260
prior to being burnt down.

19
00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:04.740
So it makes you stop and think if that was 2000 years ago,

20
00:01:04.741 --> 00:01:08.410
and we have so little knowledge of it and so much mystery surrounding it,

21
00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:12.690
what historical documentation and knowledge did they have at that point in time

22
00:01:12.710 --> 00:01:15.610
dating back thousands of years? So like I said,

23
00:01:15.611 --> 00:01:19.050
there's far more that we don't know than we do know about it such as was it

24
00:01:19.210 --> 00:01:22.290
multiple stories? We, we think it was right on the Harbor. However,

25
00:01:22.291 --> 00:01:23.450
according to ancient sources,

26
00:01:23.870 --> 00:01:28.080
the library of Alexandra was described to have been com of a collection of

27
00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:31.240
scrolls, Greek columns, a room for shared dining,

28
00:01:31.720 --> 00:01:35.480
a reading room meeting rooms, gardens, lecture halls. And essentially,

29
00:01:35.481 --> 00:01:39.120
like I said, the creation of the first model of a university campus,

30
00:01:39.940 --> 00:01:42.160
the library itself is known to have had, uh,

31
00:01:42.161 --> 00:01:44.960
an acquisitions department and a cataloging department as well.

32
00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:48.670
And we know that it had a hall containing she, of collections of Papa,

33
00:01:49.070 --> 00:01:53.270
Iris scrolls known as biblio TEI. And according to popular description,

34
00:01:53.400 --> 00:01:56.790
there was an inscription above the shelves that read quote,

35
00:01:57.210 --> 00:02:01.910
the place of the cure of the soul. So how many scrolls did they have? Well,

36
00:02:01.911 --> 00:02:04.030
the estimates vary. Nobody actually knows for sure.

37
00:02:04.090 --> 00:02:07.550
And nobody actually knows what was in those scrolls that burnt into ashes

38
00:02:08.620 --> 00:02:12.860
estimates conclude anywhere between 400,000 to as much as 700,000 scrolls.

39
00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:16.860
And the only thing that actually exists today is a basement what's called a

40
00:02:17.020 --> 00:02:17.430
Sarah PM,

41
00:02:17.430 --> 00:02:21.180
which is believed to have not even been at the actual location of the library of

42
00:02:21.181 --> 00:02:24.140
Alexandria itself. And you can see the pictures of it here.

43
00:02:25.910 --> 00:02:28.730
What's beyond interesting about the library of Alexandria,

44
00:02:29.060 --> 00:02:33.040
the extent that they went to gather information and historical and cultural

45
00:02:33.360 --> 00:02:36.640
documentation from all over the world and the library wanted everything,

46
00:02:36.850 --> 00:02:40.360
Babylonian texts, Hebrew, Turkish, anything, and everything was the goal.

47
00:02:40.700 --> 00:02:41.480
In fact,

48
00:02:41.480 --> 00:02:45.840
ships that came to the Harbor were required to hand over books that they had as

49
00:02:45.841 --> 00:02:47.640
well as documentation and,

50
00:02:47.840 --> 00:02:50.710
and blueprints essentially of ships in any other type of technology,

51
00:02:51.120 --> 00:02:53.350
which originals would be kept in the library.

52
00:02:53.850 --> 00:02:58.110
And you had professional scribes that would make a copy of the exact original

53
00:02:58.220 --> 00:02:59.840
hand, the copy over to the owner.

54
00:03:00.140 --> 00:03:03.680
And they did all this for the purposes of prosperity. However, nowadays,

55
00:03:03.681 --> 00:03:05.800
it's kind of funny that if this happened nowadays,

56
00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:08.720
I would be accusing them of well, big government &lt;laugh&gt;,

57
00:03:09.020 --> 00:03:11.280
but one can only imagine what they had in there. I mean,

58
00:03:11.340 --> 00:03:14.960
any source will agree that there was probably at least 500,000 scrolls.

59
00:03:14.961 --> 00:03:19.070
And like I said, some estimating as high as 700,000 scrolls. And by the way,

60
00:03:19.071 --> 00:03:20.910
that reminds me according to legend,

61
00:03:21.210 --> 00:03:25.230
the earliest Greek translation of the old Testament was written in the city of

62
00:03:25.280 --> 00:03:27.790
Alexandria, which many speculate will and okay.

63
00:03:27.791 --> 00:03:30.710
Maybe it was written inside the library of Alexandria.

64
00:03:31.210 --> 00:03:33.710
Before I go into details of the destruction of the library.

65
00:03:34.130 --> 00:03:36.710
Let me share with you some of the people that either studied there,

66
00:03:36.890 --> 00:03:39.940
taught there or conducted research there. For example,

67
00:03:40.040 --> 00:03:43.660
you have parkas an astronomer and the founder of trigonometry,

68
00:03:43.840 --> 00:03:48.260
who also discovered the procession of the equinoxes and mapped star consolations

69
00:03:48.320 --> 00:03:51.780
and was the first to establish various brightness levels of stars.

70
00:03:52.280 --> 00:03:56.460
And then of course you had Euclid the most famous teacher of mathematics who was

71
00:03:56.461 --> 00:03:58.340
the founder of systemized geometry.

72
00:03:58.800 --> 00:04:03.490
And then you had to threats who defined various parts of speech, such as nouns,

73
00:04:03.500 --> 00:04:05.770
verbs, pronouns, prepositions, and et cetera.

74
00:04:06.190 --> 00:04:09.210
So I mentioned earlier that there was also a medical school established within

75
00:04:09.211 --> 00:04:11.610
the library of Alexandria, which was the world's first.

76
00:04:11.790 --> 00:04:13.530
And it was established by HILs,

77
00:04:13.670 --> 00:04:17.370
who was known as the father of anatomy who identified that the brain was where

78
00:04:17.371 --> 00:04:20.600
thinking came from and not the heart, which was believed for of years,

79
00:04:21.220 --> 00:04:24.400
but brilliant people that have visited or taught or learned at the library of

80
00:04:24.401 --> 00:04:27.400
Alexandria. Doesn't stop there, take a committees. For example,

81
00:04:27.650 --> 00:04:29.520
who's famous for saying Eureka,

82
00:04:29.560 --> 00:04:33.080
I have found it or that the shortest distance between two points is a straight

83
00:04:33.110 --> 00:04:33.620
line.

84
00:04:33.620 --> 00:04:37.520
And also his famous quote about give me a lever long enough and a Falcon to

85
00:04:37.521 --> 00:04:40.440
which to place it. And I shall move the world another.

86
00:04:40.770 --> 00:04:43.830
And you'll find this really interesting is Huron of Alexandria,

87
00:04:43.970 --> 00:04:47.750
who is a mathematician and who is known and believed to have created the very

88
00:04:47.751 --> 00:04:52.470
first working model of a steam engine 2000 years before James Watts.

89
00:04:53.170 --> 00:04:55.830
Let me give you just one last example, which is really impressive.

90
00:04:56.430 --> 00:05:00.990
A toonies who is the very first person to identify that the earth rotated around

91
00:05:01.460 --> 00:05:04.660
son and he did so 1800 years before Copernicus.

92
00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:08.260
And he was also the very first person to find the circumference of the earth.

93
00:05:08.400 --> 00:05:12.100
And he estimated it correctly to within 200 miles. And by the way,

94
00:05:12.101 --> 00:05:14.580
he did this by observing shadows in Alexandria,

95
00:05:14.940 --> 00:05:19.180
compared to the south of Egypt at noon on the very same day and calculating the

96
00:05:19.380 --> 00:05:22.810
size of each shadow and that the distance would between the two ancient cities

97
00:05:23.230 --> 00:05:25.850
all correlated and was able to identify, like I said,

98
00:05:25.851 --> 00:05:29.450
the circumference of earth within 200 miles. I mean, isn't that just insane?

99
00:05:29.510 --> 00:05:32.410
And yet you probably didn't even, you never heard of that. Have you? I,

100
00:05:32.490 --> 00:05:35.650
I know I hadn't until I started researching this, right. And by the way,

101
00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:37.530
Atos also created the sea,

102
00:05:37.660 --> 00:05:41.370
which is the famous model for quickly identifying prime numbers.

103
00:05:42.080 --> 00:05:45.200
These are just a few examples, and this is just what we know of. I mean,

104
00:05:45.260 --> 00:05:49.080
one can only imagine who else had visited the library of Alexandria whose works

105
00:05:49.081 --> 00:05:50.640
were just lost into ashes.

106
00:05:51.180 --> 00:05:55.320
So let me transition now into the burning of the library of Alexandria. Now,

107
00:05:55.321 --> 00:05:58.200
there are different theories on this and it is a subject of much debate.

108
00:05:58.201 --> 00:06:01.000
However, it is widely accepted. And honestly,

109
00:06:01.001 --> 00:06:04.400
the timetable really conclusively shows that it had to have been Julius Caesar

110
00:06:04.700 --> 00:06:06.040
in the year 48 BC.

111
00:06:06.520 --> 00:06:08.640
And it's not to say that there may have not been more than one attack,

112
00:06:08.641 --> 00:06:10.120
such as Theil and, uh,

113
00:06:10.480 --> 00:06:14.920
invasion in the third century ad or the decree of Coptic Pope, uh, Theo,

114
00:06:14.921 --> 00:06:17.190
Phyllis in the three on ad,

115
00:06:17.370 --> 00:06:20.710
and there's even been suggestions of a Muslim conquest and 60, uh,

116
00:06:20.890 --> 00:06:25.270
6 42 ad or thereafter guys. That's all BS. It was Julius Caesar.

117
00:06:25.500 --> 00:06:27.910
It's so obvious the timetable fits it perfectly.

118
00:06:28.010 --> 00:06:31.830
Unless we forget this guy was a conqueror, the Caesars, that's what they did.

119
00:06:31.831 --> 00:06:34.710
They tried to conquer the whole world and they took over as much of it as they

120
00:06:34.711 --> 00:06:35.544
possibly could.

121
00:06:35.730 --> 00:06:39.540
And anyone that wasn't one was well referred to as a barbarian for the most

122
00:06:39.570 --> 00:06:41.020
part. I mean, look at this map,

123
00:06:41.021 --> 00:06:44.260
and this was taken at the height of the Roman empire, which was just by the way,

124
00:06:44.580 --> 00:06:48.060
17 years after Julius Caesar had died. And I mean,

125
00:06:48.061 --> 00:06:50.260
do you think they took over all these lands by, I don't know,

126
00:06:50.261 --> 00:06:53.220
just asking for it. I mean, no, they, they killed everyone. They conquered it.

127
00:06:53.680 --> 00:06:57.420
And this is why many people suggest that perhaps SA Vatican archives may have

128
00:06:57.670 --> 00:07:01.370
hidden knowledge about what happened to the library of Alexandria or perhaps

129
00:07:01.371 --> 00:07:04.730
even ancient scrolls or copies of ancient scrolls that may have survived.

130
00:07:04.730 --> 00:07:06.210
The fire don't forget.

131
00:07:06.320 --> 00:07:08.930
History has been written by those who have conquered others, right?

132
00:07:09.670 --> 00:07:13.490
The significance of the loss of the library of Alexandria cannot be overstated

133
00:07:13.880 --> 00:07:14.713
without a doubt.

134
00:07:14.970 --> 00:07:18.280
It's setback human civilization in the progress of it by at least a fat thousand

135
00:07:18.281 --> 00:07:21.040
years. And this reminds me of a quote by Aristotle.

136
00:07:21.500 --> 00:07:24.840
The fate of empires depends on the education of youth.

137
00:07:25.380 --> 00:07:27.000
And when you destroy information,

138
00:07:27.001 --> 00:07:30.200
when you destroy knowledge in historical context and documentation,

139
00:07:30.980 --> 00:07:34.840
it really screws over humanity for not being able to learn of the lessons of the

140
00:07:34.841 --> 00:07:39.710
past. And we're seeing this in modern times in se essentially that people, kids,

141
00:07:39.910 --> 00:07:42.230
but they're learning in school. Think about how much is omitted.

142
00:07:42.290 --> 00:07:45.750
Now I'm not gonna say that the library of Alexandria is omitted from school

143
00:07:45.910 --> 00:07:49.110
teachings. I mean, I, I don't remember being taught about it at all.

144
00:07:49.290 --> 00:07:53.030
At least not in depth whatsoever to the things I shared with you today. I mean,

145
00:07:53.031 --> 00:07:55.190
if I did learn about it in school, cuz I can't say either way.

146
00:07:55.191 --> 00:07:58.070
I don't wanna say they're not teaching it. I mean, if there is though, I mean,

147
00:07:58.071 --> 00:08:02.740
what is it like a sentence included in some paragraph about, uh, Alexandria,

148
00:08:02.741 --> 00:08:05.340
Egypt and how they had a library that burnt down? I mean, it seems,

149
00:08:05.460 --> 00:08:07.220
I mean ask how many people, you know,

150
00:08:07.400 --> 00:08:10.020
who have ever heard of library of Alexandria. I mean, yeah,

151
00:08:10.250 --> 00:08:13.460
most people watching this video probably have heard about it, but I mean,

152
00:08:13.580 --> 00:08:16.380
I guarantee if you walk down the street and asked anyone else 99 out of a

153
00:08:16.381 --> 00:08:17.860
hundred people wouldn't even know what you're talking about.

154
00:08:18.120 --> 00:08:21.610
And that's part of the problem guys. Anyways, guys, I'll leave it at that.

155
00:08:21.910 --> 00:08:24.690
I'm Jimmy, this is bright insight. I can subscribe and leave me a comment.

156
00:08:24.710 --> 00:08:27.450
Let me know what your thoughts are and share any information you may have on

157
00:08:27.451 --> 00:08:31.290
this topic because it is beyond interesting. Anyways, guys, I'll leave it there.

158
00:08:31.640 --> 00:08:32.490
Take care, everybody.
