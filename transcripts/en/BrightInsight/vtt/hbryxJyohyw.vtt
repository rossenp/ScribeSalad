00:00:00.480 --> 00:00:04.770
<v 0>There's a growing interest in fascination involving the topic of Antarctica that</v>

2
00:00:04.771 --> 00:00:07.620
far exceeds its astounding landscapes in beauty.

3
00:00:08.160 --> 00:00:12.210
And the saying that space is the final frontier. Well, that's true,

4
00:00:12.720 --> 00:00:16.380
but not quite yet because let's not forget that we still don't know what's

5
00:00:16.381 --> 00:00:17.520
underneath and articles,

6
00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:22.440
nearly five and a half million square miles of ice or 14 million square

7
00:00:22.441 --> 00:00:25.860
kilometers, which is more than a mile thick on average,

8
00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:30.180
and even exceeds three miles in thickness in certain places. In fact,

9
00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:33.780
there are many theories about Antarctica ranging from lost ancient human

10
00:00:33.781 --> 00:00:37.650
civilizations that may be hidden underneath the frozen ice waiting to be

11
00:00:37.651 --> 00:00:41.820
discovered to crashed UFO's and secret alien UFO basis.

12
00:00:41.840 --> 00:00:46.560
And even curious questions as to why various world political and religious

13
00:00:46.561 --> 00:00:49.620
leaders have visited the continent. And in this video,

14
00:00:49.650 --> 00:00:52.560
I'm going to be connecting the dots on some really interesting and even

15
00:00:52.561 --> 00:00:53.850
disturbing information.

16
00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:58.140
But first let me start off by sharing some amazing details about the Antarctic

17
00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:03.390
incontinent itself. For example, Antarctica is the fifth largest continent,

18
00:01:03.391 --> 00:01:07.860
and it's approximately the size of the United States and Mexico combined.

19
00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:11.340
And it has an incredible water volume of ice on top of it,

20
00:01:11.370 --> 00:01:15.960
which equates to approximately 6.4 million cubic miles of water

21
00:01:15.961 --> 00:01:19.500
volume based on the most recent and precise estimates. And in fact,

22
00:01:19.501 --> 00:01:20.760
if this ice was to melt,

23
00:01:20.761 --> 00:01:25.650
it would raise global sea levels by approximately 190 feet or 58

24
00:01:25.651 --> 00:01:26.484
meters.

25
00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:30.540
Antarctica is also considered a desert for the fact that it receives less than

26
00:01:30.541 --> 00:01:34.140
two inches or 51 millimeters of rainfall every year.

27
00:01:34.470 --> 00:01:37.740
And the continent underneath the ice is covered with mountain chains. In fact,

28
00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:40.110
the highest mountain is Mount Vinson,

29
00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:44.910
which is approximately 16,000 feet or almost 5,000 meters above sea level.

30
00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:49.290
And something absolutely incredible attendant underneath the ice is a massive

31
00:01:49.291 --> 00:01:53.130
trench formed by a glacier that's deeper than the grand canyon.

32
00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:57.870
It's 1.9 miles deep and more than 15 and a half miles across.

33
00:01:57.871 --> 00:02:02.130
And in comparison, the grand canyon is just over a mile deep or 1.8 kilometers.

34
00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:05.820
Another incredible fact is that it's the site of a massive crater.

35
00:02:06.150 --> 00:02:09.660
That's believed to be tied to the worst mass extinction event ever.

36
00:02:10.110 --> 00:02:14.640
This crater is two and a half times. The size of the Chicxulub crater in Mexico.

37
00:02:14.641 --> 00:02:18.660
That's believed to be the site where the asteroid had wiped out the dinosaurs to

38
00:02:18.661 --> 00:02:21.390
put it in perspective. We're talking this Wilkes land.

39
00:02:21.391 --> 00:02:24.150
Crater is 300 miles across where in Mexico,

40
00:02:24.151 --> 00:02:27.960
the Chick-fil-A crater is about 110 miles across. However,

41
00:02:27.961 --> 00:02:29.790
before Antarctica was covered in ice,

42
00:02:29.850 --> 00:02:33.870
they have found evidence that dinosaurs once roamed Antarctica. And in fact,

43
00:02:33.871 --> 00:02:36.750
the continent itself was covered in force. However,

44
00:02:36.990 --> 00:02:39.450
life today pretty much consists of penguins,

45
00:02:39.480 --> 00:02:42.120
various birds and other Marine mammals, such as seals,

46
00:02:42.540 --> 00:02:45.660
but headlines went around the world just a few years ago when they discovered

47
00:02:45.661 --> 00:02:49.890
that microbial life existed and was thriving more than a half mile underneath

48
00:02:50.160 --> 00:02:51.150
the Antarctic ice shelf,

49
00:02:51.151 --> 00:02:54.930
which completely shocked scientists what's even crazier is that they believe

50
00:02:54.931 --> 00:02:58.710
that Antarctica and north America were once touching as they've identified

51
00:02:58.711 --> 00:03:02.710
through matching rocks. And this is from a supercontinent dating before.

52
00:03:02.711 --> 00:03:06.610
Pangea more than a billion years ago in comparison to Pangea,

53
00:03:06.611 --> 00:03:09.790
which they believe broke up about 175 million years ago.

54
00:03:10.330 --> 00:03:13.540
Now diving into some of the other interesting things about Antarctica that you

55
00:03:13.541 --> 00:03:17.620
may have seen going around the internet involves this tweet that allegedly buzz

56
00:03:17.621 --> 00:03:18.940
Aldrin had sent, you know,

57
00:03:18.941 --> 00:03:22.480
the second man to walk on the moon who visited Antarctica last year.

58
00:03:22.780 --> 00:03:25.960
And he was medically evacuated for various health issues with as long as I

59
00:03:25.961 --> 00:03:29.140
believe, but here's this tweet that he allegedly sent out,

60
00:03:29.141 --> 00:03:33.100
which reads we are all in danger. It is evil itself,

61
00:03:33.130 --> 00:03:36.490
which of course has this photo of a pyramid shaped mountain.

62
00:03:36.760 --> 00:03:40.570
That's located in Antarctica, but this is completely fake. It's been debunked.

63
00:03:40.571 --> 00:03:43.180
It's been proven as a total hoax. He never sent that,

64
00:03:43.960 --> 00:03:45.550
but the mountain itself is interesting.

65
00:03:45.551 --> 00:03:47.380
And this is something that's gained a lot of attention.

66
00:03:47.380 --> 00:03:51.280
As many people have speculated that there may be lost ancient human civilization

67
00:03:51.281 --> 00:03:55.360
underneath the ice. And many people refer to this as the Antarctica pyramid,

68
00:03:56.020 --> 00:03:59.590
but upon a closer inspection, it's really not. It's not a pyramid.

69
00:03:59.591 --> 00:04:02.800
I wish it was a it's clearly carved out of glaciers,

70
00:04:02.801 --> 00:04:06.220
but something that's looked, you know, worth looking at more closely.

71
00:04:06.670 --> 00:04:09.580
If you compare it to the great pyramid of Giza, which has eight sides,

72
00:04:09.581 --> 00:04:10.840
most people are not aware of that.

73
00:04:10.841 --> 00:04:15.100
And it's only noticeable from the air during dusk and Dawn during the spring and

74
00:04:15.101 --> 00:04:18.700
autumn equinoxes. But when you look at the photo again,

75
00:04:18.701 --> 00:04:22.030
you can kind of see one side of it seems to have that line that could indicate

76
00:04:22.031 --> 00:04:26.680
possibly eight sides, but is the other side you can see right here? You know,

77
00:04:26.710 --> 00:04:28.960
it's just clearly not. It's just the mountain,

78
00:04:29.320 --> 00:04:32.320
but there have been many other things going around the internet involving these

79
00:04:32.321 --> 00:04:34.420
ancient human civilizations and Antarctica,

80
00:04:34.450 --> 00:04:36.640
possibly being the location of Atlantis.

81
00:04:36.640 --> 00:04:40.480
And perhaps it's buried underneath the ice and there's been other photographs.

82
00:04:40.481 --> 00:04:43.180
And when people look at Google earth and there's been some interesting things

83
00:04:43.181 --> 00:04:45.760
here and it's like, okay, is there something underneath the, you know,

84
00:04:45.770 --> 00:04:48.280
this ice or not? Is there some had humans live?

85
00:04:48.281 --> 00:04:50.140
There is the question that everyone has.

86
00:04:50.141 --> 00:04:52.420
And people seem to have a real interest in this topic.

87
00:04:52.421 --> 00:04:56.140
People seem to have this gut instinct that maybe people had lived there before.

88
00:04:56.350 --> 00:05:00.280
So really what it comes down to is how old is the ice on top of Antarctica?

89
00:05:01.030 --> 00:05:04.600
Scientific researchers have recently said that it's 20 million years older than

90
00:05:04.601 --> 00:05:05.470
they had ever thought.

91
00:05:05.471 --> 00:05:09.310
And it's the ice first started forming approximately 45 million years ago and

92
00:05:09.311 --> 00:05:14.290
becoming the Antarctica we see today about 34 million years ago. But you know,

93
00:05:14.291 --> 00:05:17.410
when we talk about pole shifts and I'm going to make a video on this entirely.

94
00:05:17.470 --> 00:05:21.220
And so in short, when we're talking about geomagnetic poll shift,

95
00:05:21.221 --> 00:05:24.880
which of course the world is overdue by a few hundred thousand years,

96
00:05:25.090 --> 00:05:29.530
the last one was approximately 780,000 years ago with a minor one about

97
00:05:29.531 --> 00:05:30.820
41,000 years ago,

98
00:05:30.821 --> 00:05:34.930
which some research has indicated could have potentially been the reason why the

99
00:05:34.990 --> 00:05:36.310
Neanderthals were wiped out.

100
00:05:36.730 --> 00:05:39.520
Basically what it comes down to is in a geomagnetic pole shift,

101
00:05:39.550 --> 00:05:42.850
the Earth's iron core shifts. And because of this,

102
00:05:42.851 --> 00:05:46.300
our campuses will be completely thrown off and change complete directions,

103
00:05:46.720 --> 00:05:48.700
but the earth itself doesn't just tip upside down.

104
00:05:48.701 --> 00:05:53.050
But when you think about how earthquakes and volcanic activity are dependent on

105
00:05:53.051 --> 00:05:55.450
shifting magma underneath our earth surface,

106
00:05:55.990 --> 00:05:58.610
is it possible that during these pole shifts,

107
00:05:58.640 --> 00:06:01.640
it can cause some catastrophic changes in our continents.

108
00:06:01.850 --> 00:06:05.150
So when we consider how we know that our continents are moving at about an inch

109
00:06:05.151 --> 00:06:08.090
a year, apart from each other, and we look at Pangea okay,

110
00:06:08.091 --> 00:06:09.920
175 million years ago,

111
00:06:10.460 --> 00:06:13.790
is it possible that when the massive iron core that's supposed to be at the

112
00:06:13.791 --> 00:06:14.870
center of our planet,

113
00:06:15.020 --> 00:06:18.980
when that shifts could that cause some catastrophic,

114
00:06:19.010 --> 00:06:20.870
quick movement in our continents,

115
00:06:20.871 --> 00:06:23.390
and if you think that's farfetched or ridiculous,

116
00:06:23.720 --> 00:06:28.040
let's just remind ourselves of the 2011 Japanese earthquake and tsunami.

117
00:06:28.400 --> 00:06:32.990
This earthquake being a 9.0 was powerful enough to change the tilt of the earth

118
00:06:33.020 --> 00:06:37.280
access in shortened earth days by about 1.8 microseconds,

119
00:06:37.281 --> 00:06:41.180
which might sound negligible, but it did it. But furthermore,

120
00:06:41.330 --> 00:06:45.980
that earthquake moved the coast of mainland Japan by eight feet.

121
00:06:46.460 --> 00:06:49.430
So we have to open our minds to what's possible involving pole shifts.

122
00:06:49.431 --> 00:06:52.700
And again, I'll save that for another video, but simply my point is this,

123
00:06:52.820 --> 00:06:56.300
is it possible that some of the ice in Antarctica isn't nearly as old as what we

124
00:06:56.301 --> 00:07:01.010
thought it is now I can not make a video on Antarctica without mentioning Ross

125
00:07:01.011 --> 00:07:04.730
filed island. That's right. There's an island named after the Ross' Childs.

126
00:07:04.731 --> 00:07:06.200
And if you're not familiar with the Ross trials,

127
00:07:06.230 --> 00:07:10.910
definitely look into this family and the impact that they have on or had on our

128
00:07:10.911 --> 00:07:12.650
global economic society,

129
00:07:12.680 --> 00:07:16.790
international banking and the central banks that are put in almost every single

130
00:07:16.791 --> 00:07:20.510
country throughout the world. And most people have no idea who they are. I mean,

131
00:07:20.511 --> 00:07:23.750
our whole system is made up of rules that people created.

132
00:07:23.751 --> 00:07:27.290
And no one seems to know who created these rules for our system. I mean,

133
00:07:27.291 --> 00:07:28.124
think about it.

134
00:07:28.220 --> 00:07:30.920
The rules didn't just come out of the ground like flowers and bushes,

135
00:07:30.950 --> 00:07:35.360
people thought of this stuff. And yet nobody knows who our entire lives are.

136
00:07:35.361 --> 00:07:36.920
Based off this current economic,

137
00:07:36.921 --> 00:07:39.290
international banking and central banking system.

138
00:07:39.920 --> 00:07:43.460
And almost nobody has any idea who started it and who were the masterminds

139
00:07:43.461 --> 00:07:44.300
behind it. And I mean,

140
00:07:44.301 --> 00:07:47.900
I have a master's of business administration and they sure didn't teach anything

141
00:07:47.901 --> 00:07:50.330
about this. I mean, the money that we have today,

142
00:07:50.331 --> 00:07:53.120
Fiat money is no different than monopoly money.

143
00:07:53.121 --> 00:07:56.240
It's not based on anything and people don't question it.

144
00:07:56.540 --> 00:07:59.300
So when you look at actual quotes, say from mayor Ross child,

145
00:07:59.690 --> 00:08:02.060
permit me to issue and control the money of a nation.

146
00:08:02.060 --> 00:08:05.420
And I care not who makes its laws and his son, Nate,

147
00:08:06.260 --> 00:08:07.430
Nathan Ross child went on to say, I care,

148
00:08:07.431 --> 00:08:11.150
not what puppet displaced upon the throne of England to rule the empire on which

149
00:08:11.151 --> 00:08:13.790
the sun never sets the man who controls British money,

150
00:08:13.791 --> 00:08:18.260
supply controls the British empire, and I control the British money supply.

151
00:08:18.261 --> 00:08:19.970
So it's worth mentioning.

152
00:08:19.971 --> 00:08:22.280
And if you think that I'm getting kind of off topic here,

153
00:08:22.281 --> 00:08:25.460
let me also mention the Rockefellers who had a huge impact,

154
00:08:25.820 --> 00:08:27.600
and you may have heard about them before,

155
00:08:27.620 --> 00:08:30.650
but I think the younger demographic probably is completely unaware of the

156
00:08:30.651 --> 00:08:34.070
influence that they, their family had on our society today.

157
00:08:34.550 --> 00:08:36.710
And it just so happens that once you look at it,

158
00:08:37.220 --> 00:08:40.970
the Rockefeller mountains named after John D Rockefeller. And if you're curious,

159
00:08:40.971 --> 00:08:45.380
go ahead and read this quote that John D Rockefeller said, himself,

160
00:08:45.530 --> 00:08:47.450
press pause. You can have time to read it,

161
00:08:47.451 --> 00:08:50.090
but let me keep going for the sake of brevity. And by the way,

162
00:08:50.091 --> 00:08:53.840
there are so many different theories and conspiracies out there involving the

163
00:08:54.080 --> 00:08:56.880
Ross' child. So leave a comment. If you have any insight on this stuff,

164
00:08:57.060 --> 00:08:59.550
it's very taboo. It seems like to mention these people,

165
00:09:00.000 --> 00:09:03.420
but I thought it was worth mentioning because some geographical land features

166
00:09:03.570 --> 00:09:06.000
and Antarctica are named after them. So well,

167
00:09:06.030 --> 00:09:09.720
there's that now other interesting things that you may have heard about

168
00:09:09.721 --> 00:09:10.291
Antarctica,

169
00:09:10.291 --> 00:09:15.150
there's been various conspiracies involving secret Nazi alien bases and

170
00:09:15.151 --> 00:09:17.400
UFO's, but in my research,

171
00:09:17.401 --> 00:09:20.010
I think that most of this stuff is just made up again.

172
00:09:20.011 --> 00:09:23.220
I don't pretend to have all the answers. If you have insight and information,

173
00:09:23.250 --> 00:09:25.380
please leave a comment and share it with all of us.

174
00:09:25.980 --> 00:09:29.730
But what I can tell you is that Hitler had established a base called new Swabia.

175
00:09:29.970 --> 00:09:33.390
He wanted to set up a whaling station because their economy was dependent on a

176
00:09:33.391 --> 00:09:37.020
lot of it for soap and other things. And so look into that.

177
00:09:37.080 --> 00:09:41.100
I just not so sure that involves aliens or anything else, but, and again,

178
00:09:41.310 --> 00:09:44.640
I'm somebody that do believe that does believe that aliens are actively visiting

179
00:09:44.641 --> 00:09:46.290
earth. So take it for what it's worth,

180
00:09:46.650 --> 00:09:49.920
but something that is absolutely real is something that's referred to as

181
00:09:49.921 --> 00:09:52.350
operation paperclip. And this is not a conspiracy.

182
00:09:52.351 --> 00:09:56.820
You can read about this on cia.gov. And this was secret for a very long time.

183
00:09:56.821 --> 00:10:00.270
I don't remember what year I'd have to double check when this was declassified,

184
00:10:00.900 --> 00:10:05.820
but more than 1600 Nazi scientists after world war II were taken

185
00:10:05.821 --> 00:10:09.600
to the United States and given jobs with the government and the Russians

186
00:10:09.601 --> 00:10:12.630
received, who knows how many others, some Nazi scientists,

187
00:10:12.870 --> 00:10:15.810
many people don't know this because they don't teach it in school.

188
00:10:16.110 --> 00:10:20.130
But one of these scientists was Warner Von Braun, who was an SS scientist.

189
00:10:20.131 --> 00:10:22.890
And you can see them here and look at the people that he frequented with.

190
00:10:22.920 --> 00:10:24.960
You might recognize someone up there in the front.

191
00:10:25.590 --> 00:10:29.370
And he went on to become a major player and NASA director and actually the

192
00:10:29.371 --> 00:10:31.740
creator and architect of the Saturn five rocket,

193
00:10:32.070 --> 00:10:35.640
which sent astronauts to the moon. This guy was a big deal. And for many years,

194
00:10:35.641 --> 00:10:40.290
people had no idea that he worked at a factory and I believe Berlin

195
00:10:40.530 --> 00:10:45.390
where the slowest Jewish worker was hung outside of this factory.

196
00:10:45.540 --> 00:10:49.620
And he worked there and the Scion Simon Wiesenthal center said that if he was

197
00:10:49.621 --> 00:10:52.860
still alive today, he would be charged as a Nazi war criminal.

198
00:10:53.250 --> 00:10:56.580
And most people have no idea that this is the guy that created the Saturn five

199
00:10:56.581 --> 00:10:59.280
rocket for us to go to the moon. And if you're wondering, by the way,

200
00:10:59.281 --> 00:11:02.850
how this ties to Antarctica, well wonder Von Braun and top, uh,

201
00:11:02.880 --> 00:11:07.020
NASA management went to Antarctica in the sixties and preparation for the Apollo

202
00:11:07.021 --> 00:11:09.480
missions. And without a doubt,

203
00:11:09.990 --> 00:11:12.210
the co the reason for the cold war in the first place,

204
00:11:12.270 --> 00:11:15.540
as well as the reason why it never turned into a war is because of operation

205
00:11:15.541 --> 00:11:17.700
paperclip Russians in the United States,

206
00:11:17.701 --> 00:11:22.320
both got incredibly brilliant scientists and who knows what side was able to

207
00:11:22.321 --> 00:11:26.010
develop, what type of weaponry, because of it, but to keep this going,

208
00:11:26.011 --> 00:11:29.640
many people have wondered why various leaders throughout the world have visited

209
00:11:29.670 --> 00:11:31.050
Antarctica. And in fact,

210
00:11:31.051 --> 00:11:34.890
the highest ranking us official to visit Antarctica is John Kerry,

211
00:11:35.400 --> 00:11:39.570
the went there on get this election day, 2016.

212
00:11:39.990 --> 00:11:44.070
It was really suspicious how this was reported on. He went on to say, oh yeah,

213
00:11:44.071 --> 00:11:47.070
I'm here researching climate change. And that's why I'm here.

214
00:11:47.550 --> 00:11:50.400
But there was many different theories about this people, you know, claims that,

215
00:11:50.401 --> 00:11:53.830
oh, he's visiting secrets, UFO bases that have been discovered under the ice,

216
00:11:53.831 --> 00:11:54.880
all kinds of different claims.

217
00:11:55.270 --> 00:11:58.810
I think the most likely explanation is that he was getting a free trip on the

218
00:11:58.811 --> 00:12:01.330
taxpayer dollar. He traveled all over the world.

219
00:12:01.331 --> 00:12:04.120
I think more than any other official ever had. He loves to travel.

220
00:12:04.270 --> 00:12:07.030
And I think that really what it comes down to is that's why he was there.

221
00:12:07.330 --> 00:12:10.150
If you have any other information about this, again, leave a comment.

222
00:12:10.330 --> 00:12:13.930
But if you want to know the reason why so many countries have interest in Artica

223
00:12:13.931 --> 00:12:18.190
and I have to mention the Antarctica treaty, which was signed back in 1959,

224
00:12:18.430 --> 00:12:19.930
which involves seven different countries,

225
00:12:19.931 --> 00:12:23.110
which has since gone on to involve more than 53.

226
00:12:23.860 --> 00:12:27.580
And these countries have bases. In fact, there's more than 68 bases or 68,

227
00:12:27.581 --> 00:12:31.300
I should say on Antarctica and believe it or not, the United States is,

228
00:12:31.301 --> 00:12:35.050
has the central territory, which touches all the other countries territory.

229
00:12:35.051 --> 00:12:36.910
So go figure on that.

230
00:12:37.630 --> 00:12:41.200
But if you want to know what no one else is talking about virtually no one,

231
00:12:41.650 --> 00:12:43.000
the real interest in Antarctica,

232
00:12:43.030 --> 00:12:45.940
I believe besides on who knows what's underneath the ice. Well,

233
00:12:46.060 --> 00:12:48.520
there are some things we do know that most people are not aware of.

234
00:12:49.450 --> 00:12:50.680
For one thing,

235
00:12:51.040 --> 00:12:55.750
oil it's believed that there's more than 200 billion barrels

236
00:12:55.960 --> 00:12:59.740
of oil underneath the ice or the continent of Antarctica,

237
00:13:00.250 --> 00:13:05.110
which would put it at the third, highest oil reserves in the entire planet.

238
00:13:05.710 --> 00:13:07.030
Some people say this isn't true.

239
00:13:07.031 --> 00:13:09.400
If you look at the Antarctic and Southern ocean coalition,

240
00:13:09.401 --> 00:13:11.320
they say that this is just speculation,

241
00:13:11.321 --> 00:13:15.070
not backed up by actual study and they don't believe it. But I would say like,

242
00:13:15.071 --> 00:13:16.750
wait, don't, don't be so naive.

243
00:13:16.751 --> 00:13:19.300
What do you think all these countries are doing down there? And don't pretend,

244
00:13:19.301 --> 00:13:22.930
you know, what they're doing. This is a huge area of space, you know,

245
00:13:22.931 --> 00:13:25.570
in Antarctica, again, the size of the United States and Mexico.

246
00:13:26.110 --> 00:13:28.720
So if you think that these countries and these companies that are down there

247
00:13:28.721 --> 00:13:29.800
doing all this research,

248
00:13:30.190 --> 00:13:34.180
aren't looking into this stuff and doing things on the down-low. Well,

249
00:13:34.240 --> 00:13:36.130
I think that they are. And since again,

250
00:13:36.131 --> 00:13:39.130
we know about the force and dinosaurs being in Antarctica,

251
00:13:39.280 --> 00:13:41.530
it's fair to say that there is oil under that ground,

252
00:13:42.160 --> 00:13:45.610
but even more significant or as significant I should say is the fact that

253
00:13:45.611 --> 00:13:47.620
they've established that there are quote,

254
00:13:47.980 --> 00:13:52.120
huge deposits or mounts of diamonds located in Antarctica.

255
00:13:52.480 --> 00:13:56.890
And it's not just diamonds either. They have resources, including silver, gold,

256
00:13:57.070 --> 00:14:00.310
copper nickel, platinum cobalt,

257
00:14:00.311 --> 00:14:04.090
which of course is used in all these electric batteries and cars,

258
00:14:04.720 --> 00:14:07.960
even uranium. So think about that. So when you consider again,

259
00:14:07.961 --> 00:14:10.900
that there are 68 basis and 53 countries that are there,

260
00:14:11.350 --> 00:14:15.370
you can start to connect the dots on the significance of Antarctica.

261
00:14:15.580 --> 00:14:19.180
And what we're looking at here is essentially the grand global strategy.

262
00:14:19.600 --> 00:14:22.750
All of these countries are knowing that Sunday, that ice is going to melt.

263
00:14:22.751 --> 00:14:25.930
It might not be in our lifetimes, but you know what, they are prepping for it.

264
00:14:25.931 --> 00:14:28.990
And I, I soon suspect that they're going to start digging for it,

265
00:14:29.170 --> 00:14:30.460
even if it's against the treaty,

266
00:14:30.461 --> 00:14:33.940
which isn't due for renewal and voting until 2048,

267
00:14:34.300 --> 00:14:38.260
but it is worth mentioning that various militaries are on the Antarctica

268
00:14:38.410 --> 00:14:40.900
territory itself. And even though they're not supposed to,

269
00:14:40.901 --> 00:14:41.890
according to the treaty,

270
00:14:42.460 --> 00:14:46.480
but Chilean and Argentina particularly have actual standing army presence there,

271
00:14:46.481 --> 00:14:50.050
but they claim that, oh, this is for scientific research. So it's a loophole.

272
00:14:51.020 --> 00:14:53.900
Think about all that oil and the diamonds and who knows what else might be

273
00:14:53.901 --> 00:14:57.170
underneath that ice. And it starts to make sense anyways,

274
00:14:57.171 --> 00:15:00.370
I'm absolutely going to have to make future videos and Antarctica because there

275
00:15:00.440 --> 00:15:03.800
are too many other topics that I can't include all in one video. And again,

276
00:15:03.801 --> 00:15:04.880
definitely leave a comment,

277
00:15:04.881 --> 00:15:08.570
share any knowledge or insights that you have into this topic or anything that

278
00:15:08.571 --> 00:15:11.150
I've discussed here or left out. But I'm Jimmy,

279
00:15:11.151 --> 00:15:13.130
this is bright insight hit like and subscribe.

280
00:15:13.131 --> 00:15:15.740
And I have many other videos to come and a whole wide variety of topics.

281
00:15:16.160 --> 00:15:16.850
Take care, everybody.
