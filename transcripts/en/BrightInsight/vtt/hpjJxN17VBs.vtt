00:00:02.740 --> 00:00:07.240
<v 0>The true history of ancient human civilization is far older and was far more</v>

2
00:00:07.241 --> 00:00:09.550
advanced than we were ever taught in school.

3
00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:14.080
In the mysterious sight of Machu Picchu in Peru is just one example of this.

4
00:00:14.680 --> 00:00:18.460
You do not need an advanced degree or to memorize a bunch of definitions in

5
00:00:18.461 --> 00:00:22.570
textbooks in order to analyze data and interpret things for yourself.

6
00:00:22.600 --> 00:00:26.650
And to clearly see that there are two different technologies here that were done

7
00:00:26.651 --> 00:00:30.100
at two different times by two different civilizations. Now,

8
00:00:30.101 --> 00:00:32.050
mainstream science will tell you that Machu Picchu,

9
00:00:32.051 --> 00:00:34.060
which is of course famous for their views,

10
00:00:34.210 --> 00:00:38.560
for being hidden in the remote regions of the proven Andy's more than 8,000 feet

11
00:00:38.561 --> 00:00:41.440
up. And although located not far from Cusco,

12
00:00:41.441 --> 00:00:44.470
which is of course the ancient capital of the Incan empire,

13
00:00:44.800 --> 00:00:48.790
it remained hidden until it was rediscovered in the year 1911,

14
00:00:48.940 --> 00:00:52.270
by get this explorers from the United States. Now,

15
00:00:52.271 --> 00:00:56.080
mainstream academics will tell you that the Incan empire built Machu Picchu,

16
00:00:56.081 --> 00:00:56.621
which by the way,

17
00:00:56.621 --> 00:01:01.000
translates to ancient mountain back in the 14 hundreds in order to hide from the

18
00:01:01.001 --> 00:01:02.590
Spaniards. However,

19
00:01:02.591 --> 00:01:06.310
the explanation by mainstream science and academics contradicts itself

20
00:01:06.340 --> 00:01:07.180
throughout the site.

21
00:01:07.181 --> 00:01:10.660
And I'm gonna show you very specific examples of that in just a moment. Now,

22
00:01:10.661 --> 00:01:14.110
a few of the notable features of Machu Picchu is of course, the funerary stone,

23
00:01:14.111 --> 00:01:17.980
which mainstream academics will tell you was used for rituals and for religious

24
00:01:17.981 --> 00:01:21.190
purposes. But I mean, just looking at this myself one,

25
00:01:21.191 --> 00:01:24.250
it's impressive that it was carved from one piece of stone, but I can't help,

26
00:01:24.251 --> 00:01:27.670
but see that it looked like it was part of something else at one point in time,

27
00:01:28.180 --> 00:01:29.980
or even take the famous sundial,

28
00:01:29.981 --> 00:01:33.340
which many in the mainstream would agree that it has some sort of celestial

29
00:01:33.341 --> 00:01:36.220
orientation on top of being more than just a clock.

30
00:01:36.550 --> 00:01:39.070
Another feature of Machu Picchu is the mortar stones,

31
00:01:39.071 --> 00:01:42.430
which mainstream will tell you had some sort of religious significance that

32
00:01:42.431 --> 00:01:46.420
perhaps they were used to be filled with water in order to reflect the sky gods

33
00:01:46.421 --> 00:01:50.140
from above. I don't know when I look at this and just the orientation of them,

34
00:01:50.141 --> 00:01:50.621
I can't help,

35
00:01:50.621 --> 00:01:53.680
but think that this is just what's left over from something else that was there

36
00:01:53.681 --> 00:01:54.970
a very long time ago.

37
00:01:55.450 --> 00:01:58.660
But when you haven't heard much about from the mainstream archeologists and

38
00:01:58.661 --> 00:02:03.460
historians and scientists regarding Machu Picchu is the definitive evidence that

39
00:02:03.461 --> 00:02:05.260
yes, there were two civilizations here.

40
00:02:05.320 --> 00:02:08.740
So to further elaborate on that when you see these stones that are perfectly

41
00:02:08.741 --> 00:02:11.560
cut, some in the mainstream will tell you that, okay,

42
00:02:11.561 --> 00:02:16.000
well obviously these must be newer since they were a superior technology,

43
00:02:16.510 --> 00:02:18.760
but that doesn't make sense considering throughout the site,

44
00:02:18.761 --> 00:02:22.840
these perfectly cut stones are at the bottom of the less superior, uh,

45
00:02:22.841 --> 00:02:24.730
stones that are encompassed with clay mortar.

46
00:02:24.940 --> 00:02:28.420
So how could the stones that were cut through more sophisticated technology be

47
00:02:28.421 --> 00:02:30.670
at the bottom if they were the same age or newer,

48
00:02:30.880 --> 00:02:33.490
which is why others in the mainstream will tell you that? Well,

49
00:02:33.491 --> 00:02:36.010
obviously they figured that this was just too hard,

50
00:02:36.011 --> 00:02:38.110
too difficult and too lengthy of a process.

51
00:02:38.290 --> 00:02:41.770
So they went back to the less sophisticated mortar stones,

52
00:02:41.920 --> 00:02:45.400
which is a really interesting claim by mainstream scientists considering that

53
00:02:45.401 --> 00:02:48.280
contradicts themselves in itself that throughout history,

54
00:02:48.281 --> 00:02:51.820
the evidence is that technology progresses. It doesn't regress.

55
00:02:52.120 --> 00:02:56.050
So scientists, which base everything on fact and evidence. Well,

56
00:02:56.051 --> 00:02:59.140
I just find it interesting that they would make that claim. I myself,

57
00:02:59.320 --> 00:03:00.760
the opinion of Brian Forester,

58
00:03:00.761 --> 00:03:05.380
which is that the incons found this ancient site from prehistoric times likely

59
00:03:05.381 --> 00:03:06.340
pre cataclysm,

60
00:03:06.341 --> 00:03:10.150
which of course I've discussed in other videos involving the events of 13,000

61
00:03:10.151 --> 00:03:12.610
years ago and 11,600 years ago.

62
00:03:12.700 --> 00:03:15.460
And I'll put some links for those videos at the end of this video,

63
00:03:15.910 --> 00:03:18.190
but Brian Forester, if you're not familiar with,

64
00:03:18.191 --> 00:03:21.130
I'll also include links to his YouTube channel in his website.

65
00:03:21.400 --> 00:03:25.540
But this gentleman has more than 900 videos and he's been to dozens and dozens

66
00:03:25.541 --> 00:03:29.050
of megalithic sites throughout the world. And he shows you hands, you know,

67
00:03:29.060 --> 00:03:31.990
as if you were there for yourself, there was homemade videos. And by the way,

68
00:03:31.991 --> 00:03:34.990
the last three pictures were screenshots from his most recent video of Machu

69
00:03:34.991 --> 00:03:37.780
Picchu, definitely go to his channel, liken, subscribed to him,

70
00:03:37.930 --> 00:03:41.200
and you'll learn all kinds of other amazing things that will influence you to

71
00:03:41.290 --> 00:03:45.010
look into the subject of lost ancient high technology for yourself. Now,

72
00:03:45.011 --> 00:03:47.260
to expand on the topic of ancient technology,

73
00:03:47.380 --> 00:03:51.820
how in the world were the incons able to cut and carve stones like this? I mean,

74
00:03:51.821 --> 00:03:54.940
it's one thing and I've of course seen demonstrations of people using string

75
00:03:54.941 --> 00:03:56.740
saws and water and sand,

76
00:03:56.741 --> 00:03:59.770
or even bras saws in order to cut through stone and carve them.

77
00:03:59.860 --> 00:04:02.710
But I would like to see a demonstration of where the curve stones such as this

78
00:04:02.711 --> 00:04:06.580
tower on the right or an explanation for these pillars,

79
00:04:06.581 --> 00:04:09.550
these knobs that come out of the rocks that clearly show you that there were

80
00:04:09.551 --> 00:04:13.360
some sort of roofing system or something else to this structure long ago.

81
00:04:13.361 --> 00:04:15.040
And this is just what's left of it. I mean,

82
00:04:15.041 --> 00:04:17.110
look at the precision of these stones,

83
00:04:17.350 --> 00:04:19.270
they are completely flushed with each other. Like I said,

84
00:04:19.271 --> 00:04:22.360
there was no mortar utilized and you can see a clear difference. Let's say,

85
00:04:22.361 --> 00:04:23.020
for example,

86
00:04:23.020 --> 00:04:25.900
what the wall down below verse the tower that these are just two different

87
00:04:25.901 --> 00:04:30.160
technologies absolutely done in two different ways. So the question becomes,

88
00:04:30.460 --> 00:04:34.750
how did the ink have the technology or even the intellectual know-how in order

89
00:04:34.751 --> 00:04:38.890
to cut and carve stones to this, with this precision at that point in time.

90
00:04:39.100 --> 00:04:43.000
But there's a significant gap in how this was done and it's completely

91
00:04:43.001 --> 00:04:43.810
mysterious.

92
00:04:43.810 --> 00:04:46.870
And it's mysterious because while we don't have the tools or the evidence to

93
00:04:46.871 --> 00:04:50.050
show that they were able to cut and carved these stones with this type of

94
00:04:50.051 --> 00:04:53.860
precision, I mean, look in the center of this, what's called the sun temple.

95
00:04:54.130 --> 00:04:57.460
Look at those cut marks. It says if they were shaved out of there, I mean,

96
00:04:57.610 --> 00:05:01.150
it's credit. It's absolutely incredible, but it gets even more interesting.

97
00:05:01.151 --> 00:05:02.710
Look how these stones are cut,

98
00:05:03.220 --> 00:05:06.580
flush to the ceiling of this massive stone or even the cutouts from the

99
00:05:06.581 --> 00:05:09.940
doorways, which, I mean, they made this as difficult as possible,

100
00:05:10.300 --> 00:05:13.420
but it gets even crazier. I mean, what is the story with, I mean,

101
00:05:13.450 --> 00:05:16.910
look at the steps, for example, which are pretty unique. I don't,

102
00:05:17.080 --> 00:05:19.330
it looks like it was part of something else at one point in time,

103
00:05:19.630 --> 00:05:21.880
how did they cut something so big? I mean, that's debatable.

104
00:05:21.881 --> 00:05:23.380
I'm not saying we couldn't have done that,

105
00:05:23.620 --> 00:05:26.740
but why in the world would they cut and shape stone? Say for example,

106
00:05:26.741 --> 00:05:29.650
on the right, as he flush and go sideways into this little gap,

107
00:05:29.860 --> 00:05:33.670
what is that about and how did they do that? I mean, even look at these blocks,

108
00:05:33.671 --> 00:05:37.240
it's one thing to cut a square block and stack flat stones on top of them,

109
00:05:37.390 --> 00:05:39.700
but they literally made this as difficult as possible.

110
00:05:39.730 --> 00:05:41.350
They literally made it earthquake proof for,

111
00:05:41.351 --> 00:05:44.470
to be able to withstand massive earthquakes for thousands of years.

112
00:05:44.890 --> 00:05:48.520
Another example at Machu Picchu have lost ancient high technology is what's

113
00:05:48.521 --> 00:05:50.500
referred to as the principal temple,

114
00:05:50.680 --> 00:05:54.010
look at these photos and how the structure has sunk in and fallen apart a little

115
00:05:54.011 --> 00:05:55.180
bit on the right hand side,

116
00:05:55.330 --> 00:05:59.510
which experts have theorized that somewhere between a nine to a 9.5 magnitude

117
00:05:59.511 --> 00:06:03.530
earthquake would have been necessary in order to cause this type of destruction

118
00:06:03.680 --> 00:06:05.810
based on how massive these stones are.

119
00:06:06.170 --> 00:06:09.860
But this contradicts itself for the mainstream scientists who claim that these

120
00:06:09.861 --> 00:06:14.420
large cut stones of the more superior precision are

121
00:06:14.421 --> 00:06:19.250
newer because after all these other structures that you see here at Machu Picchu

122
00:06:19.460 --> 00:06:23.360
would not have been able to survive a nine to a 9.5 magnitude earthquake,

123
00:06:23.390 --> 00:06:27.830
or probably not even an 8.0, so it completely contradicts themselves altogether.

124
00:06:28.010 --> 00:06:29.750
But going back to the principle temple,

125
00:06:29.900 --> 00:06:32.000
you can see these knobs on the upper part of it.

126
00:06:32.001 --> 00:06:34.760
You can see the knobs on the right-hand side and left-hand side,

127
00:06:35.060 --> 00:06:39.260
as well as these two holes on each side. So four holes in total on each side,

128
00:06:39.261 --> 00:06:40.430
I should say. And the,

129
00:06:40.431 --> 00:06:43.820
also the cutout knobs on the two massive stone blocks right there. I mean,

130
00:06:43.821 --> 00:06:47.720
clearly what we're looking at here was part of something completely different in

131
00:06:47.721 --> 00:06:50.480
that, again, this is just what's left of it. Now, earlier in the video,

132
00:06:50.481 --> 00:06:52.850
I mentioned Cusco, the capital of ink and empire.

133
00:06:53.240 --> 00:06:56.570
Now there are relics leftover from the Incan empire,

134
00:06:56.660 --> 00:06:58.910
as well as this lost ancient civilization.

135
00:06:59.090 --> 00:07:02.210
And when you walk down the many sidewalks and streets of Cusco,

136
00:07:02.420 --> 00:07:04.820
one side of the street will have one technology.

137
00:07:04.821 --> 00:07:07.250
And the other side of the street will have the complete opposite.

138
00:07:07.550 --> 00:07:10.730
And when you look at some of these cut marks, I mean, oh my goodness,

139
00:07:10.731 --> 00:07:13.850
what would it take to do that? Again, show me a string,

140
00:07:13.851 --> 00:07:18.200
saw able to cut and carved these many corners. I mean, in modern day,

141
00:07:18.230 --> 00:07:21.560
modern day, stonemasons literally utilize diamond bit drills,

142
00:07:21.650 --> 00:07:25.340
routers and machines in order to do anything of this magnitude. In fact,

143
00:07:25.430 --> 00:07:29.510
they even use computers and lasers and other types of technology in order to

144
00:07:29.511 --> 00:07:31.190
measure and construct these things.

145
00:07:31.370 --> 00:07:35.090
So how are the agents able to do it despite such a lack of evidence or the

146
00:07:35.091 --> 00:07:38.960
ability to do so based on what mainstream academics have taught us again,

147
00:07:38.961 --> 00:07:41.030
I don't doubt the abilities of ancient humans,

148
00:07:41.360 --> 00:07:45.020
except for the fact that we have so little evidence of any of this.

149
00:07:45.230 --> 00:07:46.340
It makes you wonder.

150
00:07:46.880 --> 00:07:50.120
And when you make the comparison between Cusco and going back up to the walls up

151
00:07:50.121 --> 00:07:52.730
in Machu Picchu, and forgive me for some of these graphics,

152
00:07:52.731 --> 00:07:54.980
I got these photos off Google images, obviously,

153
00:07:55.190 --> 00:07:58.820
but when you make the comparison, it's pretty unbelievable. And this reminds me,

154
00:07:58.821 --> 00:08:00.740
and I'll have to make a video on Saskatchewan, mine,

155
00:08:00.741 --> 00:08:03.890
which is also located just minutes from Cusco.

156
00:08:03.950 --> 00:08:08.660
These stone blocks are unbelievably heavy. They're huge. And again, you know,

157
00:08:09.350 --> 00:08:11.390
going back to string sauce and brown sauce,

158
00:08:11.660 --> 00:08:16.250
somebody please demonstrate cutting stones on this magnitude and

159
00:08:16.251 --> 00:08:17.330
stacking them again.

160
00:08:17.331 --> 00:08:19.790
I've seen videos of people lifting stones and moving stones,

161
00:08:19.791 --> 00:08:21.620
absolutely huge through primitive methods,

162
00:08:21.950 --> 00:08:26.900
but this Stonewall is unbelievably incredible and just a complete mystery.

163
00:08:27.080 --> 00:08:29.480
How could they have done this? Like I said,

164
00:08:29.540 --> 00:08:32.990
the true history of ancient human civilization is far older and was far more

165
00:08:32.991 --> 00:08:34.640
advanced than were ever taught in school.

166
00:08:34.850 --> 00:08:38.930
And you don't need an advanced degree to realize this Machu Picchu is just one

167
00:08:38.931 --> 00:08:39.860
example of this.

168
00:08:39.890 --> 00:08:42.890
I highly recommend you check out the water erosion around the enclosure of the

169
00:08:42.891 --> 00:08:45.920
Sphinx go Beckley Teppei Gunung Pedang,

170
00:08:45.921 --> 00:08:47.960
which I'm making a video on I'm working on that now.

171
00:08:48.110 --> 00:08:49.250
But if this topic interests you,

172
00:08:49.251 --> 00:08:52.670
I highly recommend you check into the works of John Anthony West Randall

173
00:08:52.671 --> 00:08:54.890
Carlson, Graham Hancock, uh, Robert.

174
00:08:55.920 --> 00:08:58.500
<v 1>Bevel, uh, Richard, Chris, Sarah, when there's many, many others, uh,</v>

175
00:08:58.510 --> 00:09:01.680
that are worthy of mention that have influenced me to make these videos and

176
00:09:01.681 --> 00:09:04.080
share what they've learned through decades of research.

177
00:09:04.290 --> 00:09:08.280
And clearly the truth is coming out guys. So I'll leave it at that. I'm Jimmy,
