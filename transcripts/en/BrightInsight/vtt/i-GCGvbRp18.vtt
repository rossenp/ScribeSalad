00:00:01.510 --> 00:00:05.640
<v 0>Does anyone else find it interesting that the authorities within Egypt are</v>

2
00:00:05.641 --> 00:00:10.200
hoping that the newly found Acropolis of underground mummies will increase the

3
00:00:10.201 --> 00:00:13.960
tourism within the country ever since it plummeted in the last several years,

4
00:00:13.990 --> 00:00:17.600
following wars and all kinds of political turmoil. I mean,

5
00:00:17.601 --> 00:00:21.390
you may remember the stories that made international headway around the world

6
00:00:21.790 --> 00:00:26.350
about two hidden chambers within the great pyramid of Giza that were allegedly

7
00:00:26.351 --> 00:00:29.430
to be excavated. And here we are more than a year and a half later,

8
00:00:29.610 --> 00:00:33.590
and they haven't even looked into it at all. Allegedly, wait a second.

9
00:00:33.650 --> 00:00:36.910
Why would I say allegedly, I'll get into that in a second. First.

10
00:00:36.911 --> 00:00:38.630
Let me just share with you about these mummies.

11
00:00:38.970 --> 00:00:41.780
And this will only take a second, cuz it's really not that interesting.

12
00:00:42.100 --> 00:00:44.100
&lt;laugh&gt; so in the deserts of Egypt,

13
00:00:44.101 --> 00:00:47.260
they have found at least 17 mummies underground, uh,

14
00:00:47.261 --> 00:00:51.340
approximately seven meters down and there's at least 17,

15
00:00:51.380 --> 00:00:56.260
possibly 30. And for some reason they claim that they're 2300 years old,

16
00:00:56.410 --> 00:01:00.500
even though they've done no testing whatsoever, there's no evidence. I mean,

17
00:01:00.530 --> 00:01:04.810
they didn't provide any type of scientific evidence to back up that claim of

18
00:01:04.811 --> 00:01:08.890
being 2300 years old. Now, why would I find that? Interesting? Well,

19
00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:13.210
they've made up stories about, uh, timetables before haven't they, I mean,

20
00:01:13.211 --> 00:01:14.730
look at the case of the great spans.

21
00:01:15.470 --> 00:01:19.490
If you're not aware more than 200 professional geologists from numerous

22
00:01:19.491 --> 00:01:21.930
countries around the world have visited the great span.

23
00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:25.120
And this stated that the evidence is overwhelmingly conclusive,

24
00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:29.800
that there is tens of thousands of years of water erosion on the limestone

25
00:01:29.870 --> 00:01:31.800
bedrock that encloses the Finks.

26
00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:36.280
That's interesting because Egyptologists are adamant that the true age of the

27
00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:39.400
Finks is only a few thousand years old between three and 4,000 years old.

28
00:01:39.520 --> 00:01:40.353
In fact,

29
00:01:40.750 --> 00:01:44.630
when the last time the Nile Delta was received enough substantial rainfall to

30
00:01:44.631 --> 00:01:48.710
cause this type of water erosion around the limestone bedrock was more than

31
00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:53.350
7,000 years ago, which is more than double the age of the Finks. I mean,

32
00:01:53.351 --> 00:01:55.990
nevermind that the pharaohs literally etched in stone,

33
00:01:56.470 --> 00:02:00.670
detailed lineage of the pharaohs dating back more than 30,000 years,

34
00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:02.670
which Egyptologists say is, is,

35
00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:07.020
and obviously they were wrong and it's symbolism of something else. Okay.

36
00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:11.020
Now getting back real quick to the two hidden chambers and how I mentioned that,

37
00:02:11.330 --> 00:02:13.100
allegedly, they hadn't looked into it.

38
00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:17.580
Keep in mind that back between 1993 and 2002,

39
00:02:17.790 --> 00:02:21.140
there was an incident where they went looking through a tunnel shaft system

40
00:02:21.141 --> 00:02:24.530
within the great pyramid to look behind a hidden doorway.

41
00:02:25.310 --> 00:02:29.010
And even though the Egyptian government adamantly claimed that nobody had

42
00:02:29.011 --> 00:02:32.850
excavated this site in the years between it doesn't seem to explain the fact

43
00:02:32.851 --> 00:02:37.610
that there's a broken and missing bronze handle. That was on that stone in 1993.

44
00:02:37.990 --> 00:02:41.410
Now keep in mind, they state that the Egyptian military guards, the entire site,

45
00:02:41.411 --> 00:02:43.970
24 7 guys, let's be real.

46
00:02:45.020 --> 00:02:48.480
The Egyptian authorities have gotten in there silently secretly. I mean,

47
00:02:48.481 --> 00:02:51.480
they could do it at night and nobody would ever know otherwise. Right.

48
00:02:52.380 --> 00:02:54.920
Why else would they be so shady about this stuff?

49
00:02:55.480 --> 00:02:59.000
I mean the last ancient wonder of the world that is shrouded in so much mystery,

50
00:02:59.390 --> 00:03:02.360
they have evidence that there's two hidden chambers and a year and a half later,

51
00:03:02.361 --> 00:03:05.720
they haven't even gone looking into it. How stupid is that? I mean, why,

52
00:03:05.950 --> 00:03:09.680
what &lt;laugh&gt;, don't just blame corruption in, in a slow, uh,

53
00:03:09.681 --> 00:03:13.840
paperwork process in Egypt. No, no, no, no, no. They are lying to us. You know,

54
00:03:13.841 --> 00:03:14.674
this reminds me,

55
00:03:14.750 --> 00:03:18.360
there's been many compelling arguments brought forward by many people suggest

56
00:03:18.510 --> 00:03:23.310
that there are two subterranean chambers below the great Finks yet the Egyptian

57
00:03:23.311 --> 00:03:25.990
government refuses to go looking into it. I mean,

58
00:03:25.991 --> 00:03:28.710
really they can't just drill a hole and, and take a peak.

59
00:03:29.500 --> 00:03:32.950
It's funny how they get so apprehensive about that and the true age of this

60
00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:35.590
Finks. Why is that? And this,

61
00:03:35.670 --> 00:03:38.870
I forget just how likely these two underground chambers really are. I,

62
00:03:39.020 --> 00:03:43.020
you're not aware there is a massive underground tunnel system within the Giza

63
00:03:43.021 --> 00:03:44.260
plateau. In fact,

64
00:03:44.261 --> 00:03:48.260
there are numerous shafts carved into solid limestone bedrock,

65
00:03:48.730 --> 00:03:52.500
many of which are completely symmetrical and P plummet more than a hundred feet

66
00:03:52.501 --> 00:03:54.460
down. And they're completely unexplainable.

67
00:03:54.461 --> 00:03:56.460
Nobody knows what these shafts were used for.

68
00:03:57.000 --> 00:03:59.420
And some of these are actually pretty close to the great figs.

69
00:03:59.590 --> 00:04:01.490
As you can see there in the background. And by the way,

70
00:04:01.491 --> 00:04:04.690
you can see pictures of Brian Forrester in these photos and he took these

71
00:04:04.691 --> 00:04:04.971
photos.

72
00:04:04.971 --> 00:04:08.570
So be sure to check out Brian Forrester's YouTube page and his website hit

73
00:04:09.850 --> 00:04:13.410
incur.com. So to bring all this together, what am I suggesting here?

74
00:04:13.590 --> 00:04:17.090
I'm not suggesting that nobody goes to visit Egypt. In fact,

75
00:04:17.091 --> 00:04:19.970
it would be great if the tourism increased because more people need to go to

76
00:04:20.040 --> 00:04:21.480
sites and see that holy crap,

77
00:04:21.590 --> 00:04:25.760
what we were taught in school about ancient Egypt and human civilization is so

78
00:04:25.920 --> 00:04:26.753
full of holes.

79
00:04:27.060 --> 00:04:30.600
And it's not until you actually look at what Egypt has to offer aside from just

80
00:04:30.601 --> 00:04:33.960
pictures of the pyramids that you start to understand that there was some sort

81
00:04:33.961 --> 00:04:38.080
of lost ancient high technology and that ancient humans were far more advanced

82
00:04:38.081 --> 00:04:39.040
than we ever realized.

83
00:04:39.460 --> 00:04:43.430
And date back far earlier than what we were taught in school. Anyways,

84
00:04:43.460 --> 00:04:46.550
I'll leave it at that. I'm Jimmy, this is bright insight. I can subscribe.

85
00:04:46.670 --> 00:04:50.270
I have many other videos to come and a whole wide variety of topics. Take care,

86
00:04:50.271 --> 00:04:50.630
everybody.
