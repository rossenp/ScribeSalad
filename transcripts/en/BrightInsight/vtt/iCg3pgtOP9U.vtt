00:00:01.340 --> 00:00:05.810
<v 0>The more, you know, the more, you know, you don't know Aristotle.</v>

2
00:00:05.870 --> 00:00:08.240
I love that quote. I think that the world would improve.

3
00:00:08.241 --> 00:00:11.720
If more people embrace that and understood that, you know,

4
00:00:11.780 --> 00:00:16.010
we all think we know everything, but unfortunately that's just not true.

5
00:00:16.011 --> 00:00:19.220
And the more people that realize this and seek truth for themselves,

6
00:00:19.221 --> 00:00:21.710
they'll learn that holy crap, I don't know much at all.

7
00:00:22.490 --> 00:00:26.090
And I firmly believe that this whole world would improve far quicker than we

8
00:00:26.091 --> 00:00:27.200
ever thought possible.

9
00:00:27.410 --> 00:00:31.340
<v 1>If philosophy was taught to children from the grade school level on up,</v>

10
00:00:31.610 --> 00:00:34.460
if we spent less time on crazy math formulas,

11
00:00:34.750 --> 00:00:39.260
and I'm not saying we shouldn't teach math and less time or more time focusing

12
00:00:39.261 --> 00:00:41.510
on teaching people, how to be less materialistic,

13
00:00:41.630 --> 00:00:46.220
to be less ego-driven into embracing more Selfoss selfless

14
00:00:46.370 --> 00:00:48.260
philosophy. Like I said,

15
00:00:48.261 --> 00:00:51.530
the world improved far quicker than we ever thought possible.

16
00:00:51.860 --> 00:00:55.550
<v 0>And this reminds me and leads me into my next quote, involving communication.</v>

17
00:00:56.210 --> 00:01:00.110
The single biggest problem in communication is the illusion that has taken

18
00:01:00.111 --> 00:01:03.890
place. George Bernard Shaw. And I would argue that well,

19
00:01:03.950 --> 00:01:07.970
communication has always been and probably always will be humanity's greatest

20
00:01:07.971 --> 00:01:12.170
obstacle that well, what we think at the time of what we say,

21
00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:15.140
usually doesn't always, uh, well, let messages aren't always delivered.

22
00:01:15.141 --> 00:01:17.360
And it's funny. We're in 2017,

23
00:01:17.361 --> 00:01:21.770
we have more abilities in technical technological capabilities of communicating

24
00:01:21.860 --> 00:01:24.800
than we've ever had. And yet it seems like communication is getting worse.

25
00:01:24.830 --> 00:01:28.100
People are they're hearing, but they're not listening.

26
00:01:28.570 --> 00:01:30.650
They're their ears are registering a sound,

27
00:01:30.740 --> 00:01:33.170
but they're not processing the information they're receiving.

28
00:01:33.440 --> 00:01:35.180
They're not considering, uh,

29
00:01:35.181 --> 00:01:39.590
an empathetic point of view or picturing themselves in the other person's shoes

30
00:01:39.591 --> 00:01:42.560
for just a second and to listen and process what they're trying to tell them.

31
00:01:43.010 --> 00:01:46.490
And even we see these issues in text messaging or emails that, you know,

32
00:01:46.491 --> 00:01:48.560
someone tries to say something just right,

33
00:01:48.710 --> 00:01:51.680
and it just gets taken completely out of them, just the wrong direction.

34
00:01:51.681 --> 00:01:54.770
We know this there's so much drama in this world. We've all seen it.

35
00:01:55.400 --> 00:01:58.850
And like I mentioned earlier, another big problem is materialism greed.

36
00:01:58.851 --> 00:02:03.140
It's like we have this ego-driven desire to just accumulate more things and

37
00:02:03.141 --> 00:02:04.490
where our whole society,

38
00:02:04.730 --> 00:02:08.750
at least in Western society for that matter is all about getting the next best

39
00:02:08.751 --> 00:02:11.930
thing, buying things, you know, look at me, look what I'm wearing.

40
00:02:11.931 --> 00:02:13.730
Look at my purse. Look at my car,

41
00:02:13.820 --> 00:02:15.860
look at my house in the neighborhood I live in.

42
00:02:16.190 --> 00:02:20.090
I'm not saying that buying things isn't fun and a bad thing at all,

43
00:02:20.390 --> 00:02:23.750
but we have gotten into a point. Most people I would argue where, you know,

44
00:02:23.751 --> 00:02:25.610
people have spending addictions. People are always,

45
00:02:25.790 --> 00:02:30.380
they're not enjoying their lives like they could and make no mistake that the

46
00:02:30.381 --> 00:02:33.740
desire for materialism is leading to many people's demise. It's leasing,

47
00:02:33.830 --> 00:02:37.280
leading to depression and allowing themselves to slave at work.

48
00:02:37.281 --> 00:02:42.170
And this reminds me of a quote by Eric from greed is a bottomless pit,

49
00:02:42.200 --> 00:02:46.070
which exhausts the person in an endless effort to satisfy the need without ever

50
00:02:46.071 --> 00:02:47.630
reaching satisfaction. It's true.

51
00:02:47.631 --> 00:02:51.170
People buy things and they're always wanting the next best thing. Oh man,

52
00:02:51.171 --> 00:02:54.320
it's a real big problem. And this leads me into another quote,

53
00:02:54.321 --> 00:02:57.710
which is quite funny by comedian George Carlin, the late comedian George Carlin,

54
00:02:57.740 --> 00:03:02.320
who stated trying be happy by accumulating possessions is like trying to satisfy

55
00:03:02.321 --> 00:03:06.190
hunger by taping sandwiches all over your body. It's true.

56
00:03:06.400 --> 00:03:07.750
Now in the title of this video,

57
00:03:07.751 --> 00:03:10.450
I stated that these would be thought provoking quotes.

58
00:03:10.451 --> 00:03:13.810
So this one is definitely, this might rub some people the wrong way,

59
00:03:13.811 --> 00:03:15.190
but it will get people thinking.

60
00:03:15.490 --> 00:03:19.270
People sometimes rationalize their greed by saying that is all for the good of

61
00:03:19.271 --> 00:03:21.730
their children, but this is nothing but an excuse.

62
00:03:21.731 --> 00:03:26.020
They use to make their despicable actions at pure respectable and

63
00:03:26.021 --> 00:03:30.220
praiseworthy Democritus. And he said this a few thousand years ago. I mean,

64
00:03:30.221 --> 00:03:31.330
that is true. I mean,

65
00:03:31.331 --> 00:03:34.870
it really is so many people will spend all their time working and ignore their

66
00:03:34.871 --> 00:03:35.351
families,

67
00:03:35.351 --> 00:03:38.830
which causes incredible suffering for children in their upbringing or that

68
00:03:38.831 --> 00:03:40.420
people, you know, in corporate America.

69
00:03:40.421 --> 00:03:44.170
And I've seen this myself where people will step on other people to get to where

70
00:03:44.171 --> 00:03:47.380
they want to be. And it can be very ruthless, very doggy dog.

71
00:03:47.920 --> 00:03:51.250
I'm more friendlier way of putting it is by Joseph Campbell.

72
00:03:51.490 --> 00:03:55.300
I think a person who takes a job in order to live that is to say for the money

73
00:03:55.540 --> 00:03:59.140
has turned himself into a slave work begins when you don't like what you're

74
00:03:59.141 --> 00:04:03.100
doing. There's a, why saying make your hobby, your source of income.

75
00:04:03.250 --> 00:04:04.780
Then there's no such thing as work.

76
00:04:05.140 --> 00:04:08.530
And then there's no such thing as getting tired. That's been my experience.

77
00:04:08.800 --> 00:04:10.390
I did just what I wanted to do.

78
00:04:10.510 --> 00:04:13.990
It takes a little courage at first because who the hell wants you to do?

79
00:04:13.991 --> 00:04:17.770
Just what you want to do. They've all got a lot of plans for you,

80
00:04:18.280 --> 00:04:22.780
but you can make it happen. Joseph Campbell, I am living this philosophy.

81
00:04:22.781 --> 00:04:25.540
Now I've chosen to become a professional YouTuber.

82
00:04:25.810 --> 00:04:29.800
I have a master's of business and I decided midway through that two year program

83
00:04:29.801 --> 00:04:33.910
that corporate America was gonna bring me nothing but suffering. I was,

84
00:04:34.060 --> 00:04:38.530
I was driving myself crazy from my prior job. And it's like, so look,

85
00:04:38.560 --> 00:04:42.160
anything's possible. Get creative. We all have creativity and imagination.

86
00:04:42.161 --> 00:04:45.670
So whatever your hobby is, whatever you spent hours doing when you were a kid,

87
00:04:45.671 --> 00:04:48.490
this is what Joseph or excuse me, Carl Young said, by the way,

88
00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:51.340
that should be what you spend your earthly time doing.

89
00:04:51.430 --> 00:04:53.350
You could find ways to make money doing it.

90
00:04:53.560 --> 00:04:57.460
A lot of this falls in line with what Plato said for a man to conquer himself as

91
00:04:57.461 --> 00:05:01.390
the first and noblest of all victories. Guys, we have so many desires.

92
00:05:01.391 --> 00:05:04.540
We have so many ambitions. We allow our egos to get the best of us.

93
00:05:04.541 --> 00:05:06.910
I've discussed this a lot in my other videos about taming,

94
00:05:06.911 --> 00:05:10.450
the animal that ultimately we all have issues as a species.

95
00:05:10.451 --> 00:05:14.050
The human brain is one hell of a thing, but we're brought into this environment,

96
00:05:14.051 --> 00:05:16.600
our society, like I said earlier, this is what it thrives on.

97
00:05:16.601 --> 00:05:20.380
This is what we're born into. So take this quote from Ralph Waldo Emerson,

98
00:05:20.560 --> 00:05:24.190
to be yourself in a world that is constantly trying to make you something else

99
00:05:24.250 --> 00:05:26.710
is the greatest accomplishment. So true.

100
00:05:26.711 --> 00:05:28.360
Everyone's trying to be just like everyone else.

101
00:05:28.361 --> 00:05:31.810
Everyone's trying to fit in guys. That's crazy. It really is Gracie.

102
00:05:31.811 --> 00:05:33.640
You don't want to be the one that stands out.

103
00:05:33.641 --> 00:05:35.980
And you're the weirdo all of a sudden, but man, that is,

104
00:05:36.340 --> 00:05:40.510
that is the direction of happiness. And that reminds me. We, in this society,

105
00:05:40.511 --> 00:05:43.510
you have people, you know, these social justice warriors, you see them on TV,

106
00:05:43.511 --> 00:05:47.290
people that are fighting for something that they believe in and in the process,

107
00:05:47.291 --> 00:05:50.950
they go crazy. The cost themselves and others, so much suffering.

108
00:05:51.220 --> 00:05:52.001
And part of the issue,

109
00:05:52.001 --> 00:05:55.960
and this ties back to Play-Doh is take what a Jordan Peterson said,

110
00:05:56.200 --> 00:05:57.650
clean your room.

111
00:05:58.250 --> 00:06:01.040
What he's referring to is that we all have problems and you're not going to be

112
00:06:01.041 --> 00:06:04.340
able to help the world or other people until you address your own issues until

113
00:06:04.341 --> 00:06:08.570
you look within, fix your problems, clean your own room up, so to speak,

114
00:06:09.050 --> 00:06:10.730
which brings me to Socrates.

115
00:06:10.910 --> 00:06:15.080
The secret of change is to focus all of your energy, not on fighting the old,

116
00:06:15.350 --> 00:06:18.260
but on building the new, this worked for a lot of people. In fact,

117
00:06:18.261 --> 00:06:21.890
Steve jobs spoke about this. People have an intuitive feeling on what's right?

118
00:06:21.980 --> 00:06:26.060
And what isn't. So spend all of your time building on what's right?

119
00:06:26.150 --> 00:06:30.020
As opposed to fighting the old, I mean take for example, Dr. Martin Luther king,

120
00:06:30.021 --> 00:06:33.710
he understood this darkness cannot drive out darkness.

121
00:06:33.830 --> 00:06:38.120
Only light can do that. Hate cannot drive out. Hate. Only love can do that.

122
00:06:38.121 --> 00:06:41.570
And oh my God, did that not work. Absolutely. You know, it's like,

123
00:06:41.571 --> 00:06:42.910
you look at black lives matter.

124
00:06:43.010 --> 00:06:46.250
And these people that just raised violence and hatred, and it's like, look,

125
00:06:46.251 --> 00:06:47.900
look at what Dr. Martin Luther king did.

126
00:06:47.901 --> 00:06:50.960
He said that we were only going to love others. No matter how people treat us,

127
00:06:50.961 --> 00:06:54.020
what they say to us, what we do to us, we are going to embrace them with love.

128
00:06:54.050 --> 00:06:55.430
And it worked. Did it not.

129
00:06:55.431 --> 00:06:59.420
He changed the course of history for the entire country forever.

130
00:06:59.750 --> 00:07:03.260
Now I just mentioned truth a second ago. So this brings me into my next quote.

131
00:07:03.500 --> 00:07:04.340
Many people,

132
00:07:04.370 --> 00:07:08.450
especially ignorant people want to punish you for speaking the truth for being

133
00:07:08.451 --> 00:07:09.650
correct for being,

134
00:07:09.651 --> 00:07:13.820
you never apologize for being correct or for being years ahead of your time.

135
00:07:14.120 --> 00:07:17.450
If you're right and you know it, speak your mind, speak your mind.

136
00:07:17.480 --> 00:07:21.110
Even if you are a minority of one, the truth is still the truth.

137
00:07:21.470 --> 00:07:26.060
Mohandas Gandhi. That actually leads me into something that Marcus Cicero said.

138
00:07:26.570 --> 00:07:30.290
I have always been of the opinion that unpopularity earned by doing what is

139
00:07:30.291 --> 00:07:33.740
right, is not on popularity at all, but glory.

140
00:07:34.430 --> 00:07:36.320
Now this leads me into my last few quotes,

141
00:07:36.321 --> 00:07:39.110
which all have to do with being present and living in the moment.

142
00:07:39.410 --> 00:07:43.160
Pythagoras said the art of living happily is to live in the present,

143
00:07:43.460 --> 00:07:47.000
but he's not the only one that has stated this. The future is a concept.

144
00:07:47.090 --> 00:07:49.850
It doesn't exist. There is no such thing as tomorrow.

145
00:07:49.880 --> 00:07:52.130
There never will be because time is always.

146
00:07:52.131 --> 00:07:56.240
Now that's one of the things we discover when we stop talking to ourselves and

147
00:07:56.241 --> 00:08:00.710
stop thinking, we find there is only the present only in internal now,

148
00:08:00.890 --> 00:08:03.800
Alan Watts, which of course reminds me of Eckert.

149
00:08:04.310 --> 00:08:08.330
Totally humans are never fully present in the now because unconsciously,

150
00:08:08.331 --> 00:08:11.330
they believe that the next moment must be more important than this one,

151
00:08:11.480 --> 00:08:15.470
but then you miss your whole life, which has never not now for real,

152
00:08:15.471 --> 00:08:19.220
I cannot begin to tell you how much my life has improved.

153
00:08:19.221 --> 00:08:22.550
Once I started embracing this philosophy of living in the present moment.

154
00:08:22.551 --> 00:08:25.790
It's true. There is no tomorrow. There is no yesterday. Yes.

155
00:08:25.820 --> 00:08:28.850
Tomorrow will come yesterday. Yesterday happened, of course,

156
00:08:29.210 --> 00:08:30.860
but it's always right this instant.

157
00:08:31.100 --> 00:08:32.960
And we spent so much time thinking about the future.

158
00:08:32.960 --> 00:08:34.850
About the past that we drive ourselves crazy.

159
00:08:35.030 --> 00:08:39.260
We spend our lives not enjoying it because you can't enjoy it when you're lost

160
00:08:39.261 --> 00:08:42.860
in your thoughts like that. I know this and it's something you can practice on.

161
00:08:42.861 --> 00:08:43.694
Believe me.

162
00:08:43.880 --> 00:08:47.780
I highly recommend you look into the works of accurate totally and Alan Watson.

163
00:08:48.190 --> 00:08:50.150
And in fact, this leads me into one last quote,

164
00:08:50.240 --> 00:08:54.740
and I'm going back to Joseph Gamble. Again, you are the hero of your own story,

165
00:08:55.140 --> 00:08:57.390
Joseph Gamble. It's amazing.

166
00:08:57.480 --> 00:09:01.140
And how many people have been influenced by this quote, myself included. I mean,

167
00:09:01.200 --> 00:09:03.960
that's something I'm embracing live your life. I mean, guys,

168
00:09:04.050 --> 00:09:06.210
map out your life on what it would be.

169
00:09:06.390 --> 00:09:08.520
If you had to write a story and a venture story,

170
00:09:09.030 --> 00:09:13.140
what would it be become that guys, you know, life is short,

171
00:09:13.141 --> 00:09:14.370
but you can become anything.

172
00:09:14.940 --> 00:09:18.780
You're the power of your intentions and the will to power can not be overstated.

173
00:09:18.781 --> 00:09:21.240
I've discussed this in other videos, embrace this.

174
00:09:21.241 --> 00:09:24.900
This has worked for many other people. We all have choices. Nothing's easy.

175
00:09:25.050 --> 00:09:29.010
You need courage, but you can do it. So anyways, guys, I'm Jimmy.
