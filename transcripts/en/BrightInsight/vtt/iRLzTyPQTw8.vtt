00:00:00.840 --> 00:00:04.230
<v 0>Just how advanced we're the ancient Egyptians.</v>

2
00:00:04.830 --> 00:00:08.430
We all learned about ancient Egypt back when we were kids in junior high,

3
00:00:08.820 --> 00:00:12.840
but it turns out that there were many fascinating details left out of the

4
00:00:12.841 --> 00:00:15.810
curriculum that most people are just not aware of.

5
00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:20.190
And I've discussed many of these bizarre facts in prior videos,

6
00:00:20.370 --> 00:00:24.720
including that out of the countless thousands of hieroglyphs and petroglyphs in

7
00:00:24.721 --> 00:00:28.230
Egypt, not one single one of them depicts anything,

8
00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:32.730
even remotely close to a pyramid, which is weird. In fact,

9
00:00:33.060 --> 00:00:37.380
the pyramids are so mysterious for the simple fact that the Egyptians left us

10
00:00:37.381 --> 00:00:42.150
with absolutely no explanation whatsoever as to how

11
00:00:42.330 --> 00:00:46.110
they constructed the pyramids. And that is indeed still a mystery.

12
00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:49.380
All we have today, our theories and guesswork,

13
00:00:50.040 --> 00:00:54.600
we were also taught that the pyramids were built for the purpose of being tunes

14
00:00:54.601 --> 00:00:59.580
for the pharaohs yet not one single pyramid on the Giza plateau was ever

15
00:00:59.581 --> 00:01:02.970
found with the mummy inside of it. True story Google. It,

16
00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:07.050
it's just another interesting fact that most people are surprised when they hear

17
00:01:07.051 --> 00:01:10.320
for the first time. And with these interesting facts comes,

18
00:01:10.321 --> 00:01:14.910
what is undoubtedly the most hotly debated and controversial topic amongst

19
00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:16.470
ancient history enthusiasts,

20
00:01:16.471 --> 00:01:20.100
which is just how advanced were the ancient Egyptians.

21
00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:22.500
Did they possess some type of lost ancient,

22
00:01:22.501 --> 00:01:25.350
advanced technology that helped them cut, carve, move,

23
00:01:25.351 --> 00:01:27.510
and place millions of stone blocks?

24
00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:32.550
Or was it just a matter of sheer labor by a bunch of guys wearing towels for

25
00:01:32.551 --> 00:01:35.700
clothing, but that is not what this video is about.

26
00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:39.060
Instead of us debating about a lost ancient technology,

27
00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:44.040
that's shift our focus and discuss the potential of lost advanced knowledge.

28
00:01:44.190 --> 00:01:47.460
That just shouldn't be possible based on everything we thought we knew about the

29
00:01:47.461 --> 00:01:48.840
dynastic Egyptians,

30
00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:53.670
and this is why I am going to Egypt next month for the first time ever.

31
00:01:53.970 --> 00:01:54.720
That's right.

32
00:01:54.720 --> 00:01:59.520
I am going for 15 days on the tour and I'm going to all the notable sites and I

33
00:01:59.521 --> 00:02:04.350
couldn't be more excited. This includes five special access permission sites,

34
00:02:04.351 --> 00:02:07.230
including two hours alone inside the great pyramid of Giza,

35
00:02:07.680 --> 00:02:11.700
as well as I'm even going down into the animatic of Syrah shaft,

36
00:02:11.730 --> 00:02:15.060
which is three levels down a hundred feet down into the limestone bedrock on the

37
00:02:15.061 --> 00:02:20.040
Giza plateau. I'm going to a number of places nearly two dozen actually.

38
00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:23.280
And I'll be sharing more details about that later in this video,

39
00:02:23.490 --> 00:02:24.300
but on the trip,

40
00:02:24.300 --> 00:02:29.190
I will be taking countless HD photos and 4k videos that I'll be able to bring

41
00:02:29.191 --> 00:02:30.720
back and share with all of you.

42
00:02:30.840 --> 00:02:34.680
So we can further explore the mysteries of ancient Egypt. But first,

43
00:02:34.920 --> 00:02:36.870
let me get back to the topic of this video.

44
00:02:37.050 --> 00:02:39.600
I was browsing through social media not long ago,

45
00:02:39.630 --> 00:02:43.740
and I came across a very interesting post by a man named Annie XD,

46
00:02:43.830 --> 00:02:47.580
who is a researcher who trained directly under the late and legendary

47
00:02:47.790 --> 00:02:49.020
John Anthony West.

48
00:02:49.590 --> 00:02:53.400
And what I saw caught me by surprise as it's something that I had never seen or

49
00:02:53.401 --> 00:02:57.300
heard of before I of course, was familiar with the Egyptian God,

50
00:02:57.301 --> 00:02:59.100
men who was the God of fertility,

51
00:02:59.260 --> 00:03:02.590
which it isn't hard to understand why well,

52
00:03:02.680 --> 00:03:05.110
for obvious reasons and no pun intended,

53
00:03:05.890 --> 00:03:09.010
but I had previously seen different depictions of men and various stonework

54
00:03:09.011 --> 00:03:12.970
found throughout ancient Egypt, including even small statue figurines,

55
00:03:12.971 --> 00:03:14.290
which let's be honest,

56
00:03:14.500 --> 00:03:18.940
stand out from other various Egyptian statues that are far more commonly seen,

57
00:03:19.690 --> 00:03:21.130
but any XDS post,

58
00:03:21.131 --> 00:03:25.660
which shows a very unique depiction of men that is different than any other,

59
00:03:26.200 --> 00:03:28.870
look at this and think for yourself,

60
00:03:29.440 --> 00:03:31.240
what does this appear to show?

61
00:03:31.960 --> 00:03:36.580
It seems to me that that is a sperm cell and is depicted in the middle of a

62
00:03:36.581 --> 00:03:41.320
stream that is coming out of an erection for men who again was the Egyptian God

63
00:03:41.321 --> 00:03:43.690
of fertility. So if you ask me,

64
00:03:43.691 --> 00:03:47.740
it couldn't be any more obvious that this is indeed a sperm cell,

65
00:03:48.250 --> 00:03:52.090
which just shouldn't be possible for the Egyptians to have known when this was

66
00:03:52.091 --> 00:03:55.870
carved in stone summit 2,500 years ago.

67
00:03:56.530 --> 00:03:57.190
I mean,

68
00:03:57.190 --> 00:04:02.140
is this not depicting a sperm cell and why on earth had I never seen or heard of

69
00:04:02.141 --> 00:04:03.850
this before as again,

70
00:04:04.150 --> 00:04:07.600
none of the other depictions of men show this unique and specific

71
00:04:07.601 --> 00:04:12.070
characteristic, have any of you seen or heard of this before?

72
00:04:12.190 --> 00:04:14.140
What are your thoughts? Leave a comment,

73
00:04:14.170 --> 00:04:19.120
but let's be clear according to modern historians and the scientific community

74
00:04:19.600 --> 00:04:23.500
sperm cells were not discovered until the 16 hundreds. In fact,

75
00:04:23.800 --> 00:04:26.980
the microscope itself was not discovered or created invented,

76
00:04:26.981 --> 00:04:31.390
I should say until the late 15 hundreds and early 16 hundreds yet,

77
00:04:31.391 --> 00:04:35.980
somehow the Egyptians were apparently depicting microscopic cellular

78
00:04:35.981 --> 00:04:38.680
biology. Thousands of years ago,

79
00:04:38.950 --> 00:04:41.590
cells are of course the building blocks of life.

80
00:04:41.620 --> 00:04:43.300
And based on what I'm seeing here,

81
00:04:43.360 --> 00:04:47.980
the Egyptians knew that yet this is not supposed to be possible yet.

82
00:04:47.981 --> 00:04:52.900
It's been hiding in plain sight for all to see for thousands of years, again,

83
00:04:52.901 --> 00:04:54.400
look at this and think for yourself,

84
00:04:54.401 --> 00:04:58.510
and then consider that you need a microscope of a couple hundred times

85
00:04:58.511 --> 00:05:01.630
magnification to see just one individual sperm cell,

86
00:05:02.050 --> 00:05:05.440
at least to the point where you can make out its shape and nature.

87
00:05:06.010 --> 00:05:08.350
Even at 40 times magnification,

88
00:05:08.351 --> 00:05:12.220
it just isn't enough to make out the characteristics. So again,

89
00:05:12.221 --> 00:05:14.320
I ask how is this possible?

90
00:05:14.590 --> 00:05:18.400
And although I will say that microscopes are not necessarily advanced

91
00:05:18.460 --> 00:05:21.490
technology. I mean, they did exist a few hundred years ago,

92
00:05:21.910 --> 00:05:25.930
but I would argue that the very thought process going into wanting to study

93
00:05:25.931 --> 00:05:30.460
something on a cellular level is indeed advanced thinking at the

94
00:05:30.461 --> 00:05:31.930
minimum. Because again,

95
00:05:31.931 --> 00:05:35.140
what we were taught in school about the Egyptians does not correlate with this.

96
00:05:35.140 --> 00:05:35.830
I mean, again,

97
00:05:35.830 --> 00:05:38.500
they're supposed to be wearing towels and moving stone blocks for a living,

98
00:05:38.501 --> 00:05:39.334
right.

99
00:05:39.520 --> 00:05:44.050
But the study of something on a cellular level cellular biology

100
00:05:44.440 --> 00:05:45.520
is something else.

101
00:05:46.270 --> 00:05:50.500
I'm very curious to see what other explanations people have regarding this.

102
00:05:50.501 --> 00:05:52.630
I'm sure some will just naysay it away.

103
00:05:52.900 --> 00:05:57.010
It will be interesting to see what the deniers say about it, but at a minimum,

104
00:05:57.050 --> 00:06:01.520
it is a fun and thought provoking conversation. And I mean,

105
00:06:01.521 --> 00:06:04.490
this is YouTube, so I can't wait to see the comments section. I mean,

106
00:06:04.960 --> 00:06:09.170
I can see it already. Oh, go. Yeah. I'm related to this guy for sure.

107
00:06:09.350 --> 00:06:10.790
Absolutely. I mean, come on.

108
00:06:10.970 --> 00:06:15.680
This is combining the topic of lost ancient technology or knowledge with

109
00:06:16.520 --> 00:06:21.470
large male. You know, don't let us down internet, come on.

110
00:06:21.500 --> 00:06:25.010
This, this is potential to be gold, but in all seriousness,

111
00:06:25.220 --> 00:06:29.720
this depiction is significant. How could they possibly have known this and less?

112
00:06:29.721 --> 00:06:31.970
They were more advanced than what we were taught in school.

113
00:06:31.971 --> 00:06:34.610
And this has been the argument on my channel this whole time,

114
00:06:34.611 --> 00:06:38.570
which is that clearly when you study all the nuanced details of the pyramid and

115
00:06:38.571 --> 00:06:41.690
other various aspects and things sites found in ancient Egypt,

116
00:06:42.080 --> 00:06:45.560
it doesn't compute it. Doesn't add up to the mainstream narrative,

117
00:06:45.590 --> 00:06:46.850
which by the way,

118
00:06:47.630 --> 00:06:51.590
is far different than even the narrative that the locally gypsies are taught and

119
00:06:51.591 --> 00:06:53.660
have been told about for thousands of years,

120
00:06:54.110 --> 00:06:58.610
which is why I am going on a tour group with the study of hematology,

121
00:06:58.670 --> 00:07:02.660
which is the people that were known to have lived in Egypt before the ancient

122
00:07:02.661 --> 00:07:03.494
Egyptians.

123
00:07:03.650 --> 00:07:07.850
Most people are not aware that the locals within Egypt have their own set of

124
00:07:07.851 --> 00:07:08.300
beliefs.

125
00:07:08.300 --> 00:07:13.100
And it wasn't until just a few hundred years ago that outsiders invaded and

126
00:07:13.101 --> 00:07:15.950
came up with their own theories. Most people aren't aware of that either,

127
00:07:16.160 --> 00:07:19.970
but again, I am not an expert, which is why I'm going to Egypt finally,

128
00:07:19.971 --> 00:07:23.480
to learn and explore the mysteries of these ancient sites and see it with my own

129
00:07:23.481 --> 00:07:25.040
eyes. And I couldn't be more excited.

130
00:07:25.460 --> 00:07:29.540
I'm going with Ben from the awesome YouTube channel, uncharted X,

131
00:07:29.750 --> 00:07:31.070
if you're not already following him,

132
00:07:31.100 --> 00:07:34.040
go to his channel right now and hit the subscribe button.

133
00:07:34.430 --> 00:07:37.790
His videos are absolutely fantastic.

134
00:07:37.791 --> 00:07:40.910
His video editing abilities are next level. And honestly,

135
00:07:41.090 --> 00:07:44.960
I wouldn't be surprised if you see his material and work on Netflix someday.

136
00:07:44.990 --> 00:07:48.860
And he's been to Egypt four times already. This will be his fifth visit.

137
00:07:49.160 --> 00:07:52.550
And he is toured with Brian Forester and Graham Hancock personally.

138
00:07:52.880 --> 00:07:55.700
And he is a wealth of knowledge. So I couldn't be more excited to go with him.

139
00:07:55.970 --> 00:07:59.720
And George Howard is also coming on the trip. He's one of the scientists that,

140
00:08:00.290 --> 00:08:04.310
uh, brought the initial evidence involving the younger Dryas climate catastrophe

141
00:08:04.460 --> 00:08:07.250
involving the Carolina base look him up.

142
00:08:07.251 --> 00:08:10.730
I couldn't be more excited to meet him and chat it up because he is a wealth of

143
00:08:10.731 --> 00:08:12.920
knowledge. And from what I understand,

144
00:08:12.980 --> 00:08:17.510
he inspired even some of Graham Hancock's work directly, but like I said,

145
00:08:17.511 --> 00:08:21.890
I'm very excited. I even got my Indiana Jones hat and everything, and yeah,

146
00:08:22.040 --> 00:08:26.000
let's try that on this bad boy is absolutely coming to Egypt.

147
00:08:26.001 --> 00:08:30.200
I am fricking taking a selfie in front of the great pyramid with this bad boy

148
00:08:30.260 --> 00:08:33.020
on. And if you're not already following me on Instagram,

149
00:08:33.080 --> 00:08:36.350
go and follow me there because I actually announced this trip a few weeks ago

150
00:08:36.830 --> 00:08:40.880
and I'm going to be blogging pretty much every day, uh, on the trip.

151
00:08:40.881 --> 00:08:44.150
And just keeping you guys informed at various sites and keeping you guys posted

152
00:08:44.390 --> 00:08:49.010
along the way, but more details about this trip. Um, 30 people,

153
00:08:49.011 --> 00:08:51.710
all the spots have filled up, which is awesome. Uh,

154
00:08:51.740 --> 00:08:53.990
but a few people have had to cancel,

155
00:08:53.991 --> 00:08:58.470
looks like in a few people others might have too as well. Cause it's 2020,

156
00:08:58.500 --> 00:09:01.800
it's a crazy year for traveling, obviously. So if you're interested in going,

157
00:09:02.520 --> 00:09:05.580
uh, it's first come first serve basis as far as, uh,

158
00:09:05.600 --> 00:09:08.250
signing up and making your deposit. So, you know,

159
00:09:08.251 --> 00:09:12.840
if you're watching this and you have a desire to go to Egypt from November 28th,

160
00:09:12.841 --> 00:09:16.710
through December 12th and seeing these sites of me, Ben and others in person,

161
00:09:17.220 --> 00:09:19.260
look it up, go to [inaudible] dot com.

162
00:09:19.261 --> 00:09:22.620
We'll put a link in the description and you can also go to Ben's website,

163
00:09:23.070 --> 00:09:25.950
unchartered x.com for more details about the trip itself,

164
00:09:26.400 --> 00:09:30.990
but it's 15 days and includes a four night Nial cruise

165
00:09:31.170 --> 00:09:32.760
river cruise, which is going to be awesome.

166
00:09:32.761 --> 00:09:35.250
Apparently that's a highlight for a lot of people that have gone to Egypt

167
00:09:35.251 --> 00:09:39.780
before. Uh, it's all five star hotels, five star food. And,

168
00:09:40.260 --> 00:09:41.340
uh, it's going to be, you know,

169
00:09:41.370 --> 00:09:44.790
good food cocktails and conspiracy conjecture at night.

170
00:09:45.240 --> 00:09:47.730
It should be a really good time. And one thing, I mean,

171
00:09:47.731 --> 00:09:49.650
obviously it's a two week trip, so it's not cheap,

172
00:09:49.800 --> 00:09:51.780
especially with everything being luxurious. Uh,

173
00:09:51.810 --> 00:09:55.650
but it does include amazing things such as the, uh,

174
00:09:56.190 --> 00:10:01.050
Syrah shaft that in itself is a $2,000 fee. Uh, and that's,

175
00:10:01.051 --> 00:10:03.660
if you can even get permission to go in and then they take 2000,

176
00:10:03.661 --> 00:10:07.680
so going as a group, you're able to divide it up and get more bang out of it.

177
00:10:08.250 --> 00:10:10.350
Uh, same thing with two hours alone in the great pyramid.

178
00:10:10.590 --> 00:10:13.950
And we're even going down onto the grounds of the Assyrian itself, uh,

179
00:10:13.980 --> 00:10:17.430
Abra wash, shabu sear, and I think it's five or six special access place.

180
00:10:17.431 --> 00:10:22.110
So it's awesome. And I couldn't be more excited. Um, what else is there?

181
00:10:22.680 --> 00:10:25.470
Oh, here's another big reason why I'm so excited to be going,

182
00:10:25.471 --> 00:10:27.180
even though it's a crazy year for traveling.

183
00:10:27.750 --> 00:10:32.190
The opportunity here is huge because tourism, Egypt is dead.

184
00:10:32.250 --> 00:10:35.280
Many of these sites are completely empty right now. No one's there.

185
00:10:35.640 --> 00:10:39.690
So there has never been a better time to see and document these sites on camera.

186
00:10:39.870 --> 00:10:43.710
Because usually if you've seen anything in Egypt involving video and pictures,

187
00:10:43.711 --> 00:10:45.570
it's just people everywhere. It's kind of like Disneyland,

188
00:10:45.571 --> 00:10:49.080
but people from all over the world, but not right now.

189
00:10:49.081 --> 00:10:52.260
So that's one of the things that I'm very excited about is being able to

190
00:10:52.261 --> 00:10:55.770
document this stuff and share with everybody with you when I come home.

191
00:10:56.130 --> 00:10:58.020
But anyways, so I'm going to wrap this up.

192
00:10:58.050 --> 00:11:00.930
I have two other videos coming before I go on my departure.

193
00:11:00.931 --> 00:11:02.610
This video is going to be a lot longer,

194
00:11:02.640 --> 00:11:06.570
but I'm using a new video editing software and it's a pain to make a long video

195
00:11:06.630 --> 00:11:08.640
with something new. So look forward to that.

196
00:11:08.641 --> 00:11:12.840
I have a couple of good ones coming and then I'll be blogging daily on Instagram

197
00:11:12.900 --> 00:11:15.420
while I'm on my trip. So again, go follow me on Instagram.

198
00:11:15.421 --> 00:11:17.980
If you're not already go follow on at,

199
00:11:17.981 --> 00:11:21.990
on charted X and I'll leave it at that I'm Jimmy.

200
00:11:21.991 --> 00:11:23.400
My channel is called bright insight,

201
00:11:23.430 --> 00:11:25.890
hit the like button and subscribe and leave a comment,

202
00:11:25.891 --> 00:11:27.990
share what your thoughts are on everything. Discussing this. I mean,

203
00:11:27.991 --> 00:11:29.640
is this a sperm cell or not?

204
00:11:29.790 --> 00:11:31.380
If you don't think it is share what you think it is,

205
00:11:32.040 --> 00:11:34.410
but I'm telling you if there's anything guys,

206
00:11:35.400 --> 00:11:39.960
the ancient Egyptians are far more mysterious than most people realize.

207
00:11:40.050 --> 00:11:43.770
There's so many unanswered questions involving how they did everything and what

208
00:11:43.830 --> 00:11:48.780
they knew. And if you ask me, this is evidence that at a minimum,

209
00:11:49.290 --> 00:11:51.330
they were more advanced than what we were taught in school.

210
00:11:51.331 --> 00:11:54.420
So it's a foundation for people to start exploring and opening their minds to

211
00:11:54.421 --> 00:11:58.470
what else is possible involving our ancient past. But I'll leave it at that.

212
00:11:58.740 --> 00:12:01.770
You guys take care and I have another video coming soon. Bye everyone.
