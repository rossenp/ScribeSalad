1
00:00:03.650 --> 00:00:07.210
<v 0>Although we were taught in school that the pyramids of Giza were built to be</v>

2
00:00:07.220 --> 00:00:08.410
tombs for the pharaohs.

3
00:00:08.760 --> 00:00:11.850
There's significant evidence that completely contradicts this.

4
00:00:12.230 --> 00:00:13.063
And in this video,

5
00:00:13.310 --> 00:00:16.570
I'm gonna connect the dots on several key pieces of evidence that have been

6
00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:20.690
seemingly left out of our school textbooks that will show any reasonable person

7
00:00:20.720 --> 00:00:24.520
that clearly the, these things were built to be something far different. Now,

8
00:00:24.521 --> 00:00:25.354
let me just say,

9
00:00:25.660 --> 00:00:29.000
I'm not saying that the dynastic Egyptians that we're so familiar with never

10
00:00:29.040 --> 00:00:30.320
utilized these as tombs.

11
00:00:30.440 --> 00:00:33.080
<v 1>I mean, take, for example, the step pyramid of Sakara,</v>

12
00:00:33.490 --> 00:00:37.720
which I mean shares no resemblance whatsoever to that of the pyramids of Giza,

13
00:00:37.780 --> 00:00:40.680
the size and precision of the stone blocks, the internal structure,

14
00:00:40.750 --> 00:00:43.990
nothing about it, shares any of the characteristics of that,

15
00:00:44.150 --> 00:00:44.983
of the great pyramid.

16
00:00:45.010 --> 00:00:48.310
And it's interesting because the mainstream will tell you that this pyramid was

17
00:00:48.311 --> 00:00:51.070
built 2000 years after that, of the great pyramid of Giza.

18
00:00:51.170 --> 00:00:54.630
<v 0>So why is the technology regressing? I mean, that is interesting,</v>

19
00:00:55.090 --> 00:00:58.670
but this pyramid actually did have burial sites and they were dated at 2,600

20
00:00:58.671 --> 00:01:02.830
years ago. So again, 2000 years after the great pyramids of Giza now,

21
00:01:02.831 --> 00:01:05.300
before I keep going, if you haven't seen my other videos,

22
00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:10.020
I discussed the overwhelming evidence of the global Lys that happened 13,000

23
00:01:10.400 --> 00:01:12.180
and 11,600 years ago,

24
00:01:12.181 --> 00:01:16.180
which included a sudden and rapid 400 foot rise in global sea levels.

25
00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:20.740
So essentially it was a reset button for whatever civilization was alive at that

26
00:01:20.741 --> 00:01:25.330
time. And the survivors of it came and found Egypt and started building there

27
00:01:25.331 --> 00:01:28.370
themselves. And the pyramid of Sakara is an example of this,

28
00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:32.210
but what you will find incredibly interesting is that despite the tens of

29
00:01:32.370 --> 00:01:35.930
thousands of petroglyphs and hieroglyphs located throughout ancient Egypt,

30
00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:40.850
not a single one of them show us anything about how they built the pyramids or

31
00:01:40.851 --> 00:01:41.730
the Spinks itself.

32
00:01:41.910 --> 00:01:46.120
But what's even more interesting is that they literally carved in stone detailed

33
00:01:46.121 --> 00:01:49.840
lineage of the pharaohs dating back more than 30,000 years.

34
00:01:50.260 --> 00:01:54.240
But despite the fact that the ancient Egyptians left us no indication of how

35
00:01:54.241 --> 00:01:55.680
they built the spins or the pyramids,

36
00:01:55.900 --> 00:01:59.120
the mainstream has all kinds of different theories and how they could have done.

37
00:01:59.140 --> 00:02:03.480
So particularly that of pulley systems, which are backed by zero evidence,

38
00:02:03.481 --> 00:02:07.230
they have never found a single pulley anywhere in Egypt from the,

39
00:02:07.470 --> 00:02:08.010
from the ancients.

40
00:02:08.010 --> 00:02:11.390
So it's interesting that they throw out that theory and it's not backed by any

41
00:02:11.550 --> 00:02:14.550
evidence whatsoever, which just contradicts what science is all about.

42
00:02:15.130 --> 00:02:18.630
So I just find that interesting and not to mention when you really start looking

43
00:02:18.650 --> 00:02:20.790
at these methods that they outline, I mean, come on,

44
00:02:20.791 --> 00:02:24.110
do you really think they built these cranes up to the top of the pyramid?

45
00:02:24.350 --> 00:02:26.220
I mean, when you look how high up these are,

46
00:02:26.330 --> 00:02:29.940
another common theory is that they layered dirt and just built its way up the

47
00:02:29.941 --> 00:02:33.980
pyramid in order to sled these massive stone blocks. And that's how they did it.

48
00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:36.980
But I mean, give me a break. It's a 500 foot tall pyramid.

49
00:02:37.240 --> 00:02:38.220
And although the mainstream,

50
00:02:38.221 --> 00:02:40.900
isn't really saying that they layered dirt 500 feet high,

51
00:02:41.240 --> 00:02:43.500
how high do they think they did it? It doesn't make sense.

52
00:02:43.730 --> 00:02:45.100
There's no evidence for it.

53
00:02:45.120 --> 00:02:48.770
And it's certainly doesn't justify how they stack these blocks up at the top of

54
00:02:48.771 --> 00:02:50.410
this pyramid. And by the way, yes,

55
00:02:50.411 --> 00:02:54.610
I've seen Wally from Michigan demonstrate this incredibly clever way of moving a

56
00:02:54.611 --> 00:02:56.930
stone block all by himself, 20 tons, in fact,

57
00:02:57.350 --> 00:02:59.760
but are you telling me that this was done at the top of that pyramid?

58
00:03:00.160 --> 00:03:00.880
I mean really,

59
00:03:00.880 --> 00:03:04.480
did they even have the ability to channel water and hose away the sand in order

60
00:03:04.481 --> 00:03:05.640
to make this thing lift itself?

61
00:03:06.020 --> 00:03:09.280
And when you look at just how steep the pyramid is, guys, it doesn't make sense.

62
00:03:09.281 --> 00:03:11.520
That's clearly not what they did at the top of this pyramid.

63
00:03:12.220 --> 00:03:15.480
And although it's very clever and yes, you can lift a stone all by yourself.

64
00:03:15.780 --> 00:03:19.430
It doesn't make sense when you consider all details about the pyramid

65
00:03:19.431 --> 00:03:20.870
themselves. And by the way,

66
00:03:20.900 --> 00:03:24.790
most people are not aware of the incredible precision that it took to make this

67
00:03:24.791 --> 00:03:28.270
pyramid. The foundation of itself is a complete mystery,

68
00:03:28.440 --> 00:03:33.190
750 feet wide at its base covering more than 13.1 acres.

69
00:03:33.330 --> 00:03:36.390
And it's somehow leveled perfectly from one side to the other,

70
00:03:36.610 --> 00:03:38.830
to within a half an inch guys,

71
00:03:39.080 --> 00:03:42.620
not something that was possible until just a few decades ago through the use of

72
00:03:42.670 --> 00:03:45.540
laser leveling. So how in the world did they do this?

73
00:03:45.880 --> 00:03:48.820
Why in the world did they go to an extent to make something so big and so

74
00:03:48.821 --> 00:03:51.340
massive if it was just supposed to be a tomb? I mean,

75
00:03:51.341 --> 00:03:54.500
we're talking 481 feet high, so I'm from Phoenix.

76
00:03:54.640 --> 00:03:56.100
And when you look at the skyline here,

77
00:03:56.240 --> 00:04:01.050
the chase tower is the tallest building in Phoenix, 38,

78
00:04:01.050 --> 00:04:03.370
483 feet high. So basically identical to the great pyramid.

79
00:04:04.190 --> 00:04:05.610
And when you look at here in downtown,

80
00:04:05.650 --> 00:04:09.450
I mean the great pyramid of Giza would basically take up half of the downtown in

81
00:04:09.451 --> 00:04:13.730
itself. That's incredible. This compare this to the valley of the Kings,

82
00:04:13.731 --> 00:04:16.930
where we know we have found, well, at least 68 pharaohs so far,

83
00:04:17.240 --> 00:04:19.890
there's possibly hundreds of others. I mean, there's many chain.

84
00:04:20.110 --> 00:04:23.240
They haven't even found yet as they keep finding new ones. In fact,

85
00:04:23.241 --> 00:04:27.960
one of the individual chambers has more than 130 chambers of itself. I mean,

86
00:04:27.961 --> 00:04:29.520
this place is absolutely massive.

87
00:04:29.940 --> 00:04:33.720
And it must be mentioned that the mainstream claims that they built the valley

88
00:04:33.721 --> 00:04:37.560
of the Kings after the pyramids, in order to thwart grave robbers.

89
00:04:37.700 --> 00:04:39.160
But that contradicts itself. I mean,

90
00:04:39.161 --> 00:04:41.550
when you look at the pyramids in these small tunnels, I mean,

91
00:04:41.551 --> 00:04:43.310
we're talking three feet by three feet wide,

92
00:04:43.770 --> 00:04:45.350
and then you look at the valley of the Kings,

93
00:04:45.351 --> 00:04:48.630
which have these massive entry ways, these incredible galleries,

94
00:04:48.970 --> 00:04:53.430
and not to mention these paintings or hieroglyphs all over the place,

95
00:04:54.130 --> 00:04:55.710
the pyramids have nothing like that.

96
00:04:55.850 --> 00:04:58.990
And don't forget all the big name pharaohs that were buried there. King Tut,

97
00:04:59.350 --> 00:05:00.230
Ramsey's the second.

98
00:05:00.370 --> 00:05:03.900
And that's not for get how significant Ramsey I second was apparently throughout

99
00:05:03.901 --> 00:05:06.780
ancient Egypt. I mean, his statue is found throughout the entire country.

100
00:05:07.260 --> 00:05:10.780
I mean, this guy had his own temple called the temple of Ramsey's allegedly.

101
00:05:11.080 --> 00:05:12.620
And this thing was absolutely massive.

102
00:05:12.930 --> 00:05:16.700
This guy was of significant importance and yet they chose to bury him at the

103
00:05:16.701 --> 00:05:20.180
valley of the Kings and take a look at these two photos of other tombs

104
00:05:20.181 --> 00:05:23.210
throughout ancient Egypt. You see these hieroglyphs and petroglyphs.

105
00:05:23.211 --> 00:05:23.950
It's incredible.

106
00:05:23.950 --> 00:05:27.890
And when we compare these known tombs to that of the interior of the pyramid is

107
00:05:27.910 --> 00:05:31.090
I'm about to show you you'll see that they don't have one single petroglyph or

108
00:05:31.091 --> 00:05:34.490
hieroglyph throw any of these pyramids of Giza. Now, when you enter the pyramid,

109
00:05:34.680 --> 00:05:37.450
like I said, there's a three by three foot tunnel shaft,

110
00:05:37.630 --> 00:05:40.050
and this tunnel shaft can take you to a subterranean chamber.

111
00:05:40.230 --> 00:05:42.560
And when you look at these photos and there's so few you of them,

112
00:05:42.561 --> 00:05:44.440
because the Egyptian authorities don't allow it,

113
00:05:44.740 --> 00:05:46.880
it just makes you wonder if this was used for something else.

114
00:05:46.930 --> 00:05:49.280
Mainstream will tell you is just an unfinished burial chamber,

115
00:05:49.420 --> 00:05:50.720
but I don't know guys,

116
00:05:50.860 --> 00:05:54.800
why dig three stories down through limestone bedrock just to do that.

117
00:05:54.860 --> 00:05:56.360
But as you go through the tunnel shaft,

118
00:05:56.361 --> 00:05:59.920
if you decide to go up instead of down to the subterranean chamber, again,

119
00:06:00.050 --> 00:06:02.320
three feet by three feet, oh, and keep in mind.

120
00:06:02.320 --> 00:06:04.680
When you look at these wood steps, we put those there.

121
00:06:04.830 --> 00:06:08.240
This was just a smooth shaft. And of course the Egyptologists say,

122
00:06:08.241 --> 00:06:09.840
that's just too thwart the grave Roberts,

123
00:06:09.841 --> 00:06:12.280
which again reminds me of the valley of the Kings,

124
00:06:12.281 --> 00:06:13.560
cuz they didn't do any of that.

125
00:06:13.940 --> 00:06:16.440
And after traveling almost a couple hundred feet through this ton,

126
00:06:16.690 --> 00:06:21.310
you'll get to, what's called the grand gallery, which has insane acoustic, uh,

127
00:06:21.311 --> 00:06:21.950
abilities.

128
00:06:21.950 --> 00:06:24.990
I highly recommend you just simply YouTube people have videos of this,

129
00:06:25.150 --> 00:06:27.630
where they do the home sound. And it's incredible,

130
00:06:27.660 --> 00:06:29.150
even though you're listening to it through camera,

131
00:06:29.151 --> 00:06:32.390
which just never does it justice it further validates that this site may have

132
00:06:32.391 --> 00:06:34.310
had a more sophisticated purpose. I mean,

133
00:06:34.311 --> 00:06:38.340
is it just a coincidence that these baffling chamber are like this? And again,

134
00:06:38.341 --> 00:06:42.180
you'll see a complete absence of hieroglyphs or petroglyphs anywhere inside

135
00:06:42.181 --> 00:06:44.500
here. If you go to the red pyramid in Dar shore,

136
00:06:44.930 --> 00:06:49.540
this chamber is five stories tall and the acoustics are absolutely

137
00:06:49.710 --> 00:06:53.100
incredible, but here's where things really start to get interesting.

138
00:06:53.200 --> 00:06:55.820
So back at the great pyramid of Giza, the King's chamber,

139
00:06:56.530 --> 00:06:58.930
just look at this at absolutely incredible structure,

140
00:06:59.100 --> 00:07:02.490
which is not even visible from within the chamber itself. I mean,

141
00:07:02.491 --> 00:07:03.570
if you look at the roof here,

142
00:07:03.910 --> 00:07:07.330
you can't see these interesting stack layers of blocks,

143
00:07:07.580 --> 00:07:09.210
which make you want I these slabs,

144
00:07:09.211 --> 00:07:12.970
what were these used for when you just simply look at this and consider the fact

145
00:07:12.971 --> 00:07:17.170
that it's not part of decoration, it makes you wonder what this was for,

146
00:07:17.171 --> 00:07:21.240
because I, I would consider this evidence of something far more sophisticated.

147
00:07:21.740 --> 00:07:25.840
Why do this? And it goes beyond the realm of just structural integrity. I mean,

148
00:07:25.920 --> 00:07:29.680
I can understand the Chevron stack blocks within the Queens chamber. I mean,

149
00:07:29.681 --> 00:07:31.200
take a look at the Queens chamber real quick,

150
00:07:31.290 --> 00:07:33.760
which also has incredible acoustic, uh, abilities.

151
00:07:34.060 --> 00:07:36.960
And you also notice in the Queens chamber that small passageway.

152
00:07:37.220 --> 00:07:40.510
Now let's go back to the Kings chamber and you'll see the same thing there.

153
00:07:40.850 --> 00:07:45.070
But what stands out in the King's chamber is of course this sarcophagus and it's

154
00:07:45.071 --> 00:07:47.830
easy just to look at this and be like, oh, well this place was a tomb,

155
00:07:48.330 --> 00:07:51.470
but there's some details that you may have not have heard. First of all,

156
00:07:51.600 --> 00:07:55.990
mainstream archeologists and Egyptologists do agree that the construction of

157
00:07:55.991 --> 00:08:00.980
this sarcophagus is significantly less area than that of the stone blocks that

158
00:08:00.981 --> 00:08:04.100
encompass the chamber itself. They describe the cut marks on it.

159
00:08:04.130 --> 00:08:07.180
It's very shotty. And clearly besides the fact that it's broken,

160
00:08:07.650 --> 00:08:11.580
many people will suggest that this was constructed after the pyramid itself.

161
00:08:11.640 --> 00:08:13.380
And when you look at these older photographs,

162
00:08:13.490 --> 00:08:15.260
there's clearly other stuff in here. I mean,

163
00:08:15.261 --> 00:08:17.380
look at these broken blocks that in my opinion,

164
00:08:17.480 --> 00:08:20.250
do not appear to be part of a seal for this sarcophagus.

165
00:08:20.840 --> 00:08:24.330
It's evidence that there was more things in this chamber and over the last

166
00:08:24.331 --> 00:08:27.650
hundreds and thousands of years, who knows what happened in there,

167
00:08:27.651 --> 00:08:28.730
what was taken out, I mean,

168
00:08:28.731 --> 00:08:32.530
even pay attention to the missing stone blocks at the bottom on the flooring

169
00:08:32.531 --> 00:08:34.450
there in the corner that show you that, well,

170
00:08:34.451 --> 00:08:37.090
maybe this is just part of something completely different than what we're

171
00:08:37.091 --> 00:08:38.530
looking at today. And by the way,

172
00:08:38.531 --> 00:08:42.400
that's sarcophagus is not even centered in that room. There's no paintings,

173
00:08:42.430 --> 00:08:44.360
there's no etch stone. And again,

174
00:08:44.600 --> 00:08:47.400
when you consider these stacked slabs above it that you can't even see from

175
00:08:47.401 --> 00:08:49.160
within the tube itself, guys,

176
00:08:49.240 --> 00:08:52.000
I think we're looking at something far more sophisticated. And of course,

177
00:08:52.001 --> 00:08:54.760
when you see these massive stone slabs from within inside the chamber,

178
00:08:54.761 --> 00:08:59.360
which by the way, this is granite, about 60% of the pyramid is from limestone.

179
00:08:59.361 --> 00:09:00.400
That was cured on site,

180
00:09:00.580 --> 00:09:03.800
but most people are not aware that a significant amount of these blocks,

181
00:09:04.160 --> 00:09:07.960
maybe a million came from 500 miles away from the Osan Qury,

182
00:09:08.260 --> 00:09:13.200
but why would they go to the extent to get the internal stones from 500

183
00:09:13.201 --> 00:09:16.710
miles away? Why did they choose to go from limestone to granite?

184
00:09:17.200 --> 00:09:20.950
Isn't that possible evidence that this had an actual purpose? I mean,

185
00:09:21.110 --> 00:09:23.670
I once say it's aesthetics, would you? And by the way,

186
00:09:23.671 --> 00:09:26.350
this is what it looks like today. They've removed all the other blocks.

187
00:09:26.500 --> 00:09:29.030
They filled up the flooring, uh, from the tile that was missing,

188
00:09:29.031 --> 00:09:31.670
which I think was actually not supposed to be there in the first place.

189
00:09:32.410 --> 00:09:35.460
And any evidence that there was other things in there has since removed.

190
00:09:35.461 --> 00:09:37.740
And I just find that to be well, I just don't like it.

191
00:09:37.820 --> 00:09:40.020
I wanna see what it looked like. At least when we found it,

192
00:09:40.160 --> 00:09:42.300
who knows what happened there a thousand years ago. Right?

193
00:09:43.080 --> 00:09:46.060
But another point that you need to know is that we haven't even found all the

194
00:09:46.061 --> 00:09:46.600
chambers.

195
00:09:46.600 --> 00:09:49.260
You may have seen it in the news that they've identified that there's another

196
00:09:49.261 --> 00:09:51.700
chamber in the pyramid that getting ready to do excavation,

197
00:09:51.701 --> 00:09:54.420
they're trying to identify which stone blocks it's specifically at.

198
00:09:54.620 --> 00:09:55.453
So we know to drill.

199
00:09:55.910 --> 00:09:58.690
But obviously there's all kinds of outstanding questions here that are not

200
00:09:58.691 --> 00:09:59.270
answered.

201
00:09:59.270 --> 00:10:02.530
And then when you also look at the other incredible stone structures around the

202
00:10:02.531 --> 00:10:05.970
Giza plateau, I mean, look at this. What is that? When you look at that,

203
00:10:05.971 --> 00:10:09.170
does that not just look like, I don't know, a machine of some kind,

204
00:10:09.340 --> 00:10:13.370
which of course brings me to an incredible quote by the legendary John Anthony

205
00:10:13.370 --> 00:10:17.200
West few things in this world are more predictable than the reaction of

206
00:10:17.201 --> 00:10:21.520
conventional minds to unconventional ideas and history supports this guys.

207
00:10:21.521 --> 00:10:24.560
Unfortunately, new ideas are always shunned by the masses,

208
00:10:24.561 --> 00:10:28.040
by the mainstream and the mainstream archeologists scientists,

209
00:10:28.041 --> 00:10:30.560
Egyptologists guys. They're no, they're,

210
00:10:30.561 --> 00:10:33.640
they're people they're no different than the establishment that exists in the

211
00:10:33.641 --> 00:10:35.360
media or our politicians.

212
00:10:35.460 --> 00:10:39.470
And you just ultimately see that people look out for themselves more than look

213
00:10:39.471 --> 00:10:40.304
out for the masses.

214
00:10:40.330 --> 00:10:43.830
And I highly recommend that you look into the works of John Anthony West because

215
00:10:43.831 --> 00:10:47.870
he outlines an epic detail through his lifetime work of investigation of the

216
00:10:47.871 --> 00:10:48.870
sites around ancient Egypt.

217
00:10:49.220 --> 00:10:52.470
That clearly these sites were part of something Mar far more sophisticated.

218
00:10:52.570 --> 00:10:55.630
And again, this brings me back to all the interesting things about the pyramids.

219
00:10:55.631 --> 00:10:58.180
Why make them so big? Could they even have done it? Well,

220
00:10:58.181 --> 00:10:59.300
someone did it clearly,

221
00:11:00.040 --> 00:11:03.580
but why is there no evidence whatsoever for any of these pulley systems?

222
00:11:03.800 --> 00:11:04.633
Why did the, uh,

223
00:11:05.060 --> 00:11:09.380
dynastic Egyptians leave us not a single explanation on anything they didn't out

224
00:11:09.381 --> 00:11:12.940
of all the things they etched in stone wrote in paintings all over throughout

225
00:11:12.941 --> 00:11:17.100
ancient Egypt, they just leave out anything about the pyramids or the Finks.

226
00:11:17.650 --> 00:11:19.050
I mean, come on. That's really interesting.

227
00:11:19.230 --> 00:11:22.410
And then when you compare it to known tombs of, of Egypt,

228
00:11:22.411 --> 00:11:25.530
like the valley of the Kings, I mean, come on guys, there's something off here.

229
00:11:25.720 --> 00:11:29.410
Just look at it and think for yourself. That's what's most important. Anyways,

230
00:11:29.411 --> 00:11:31.570
guys, I'm gonna close this up, but give me a thumbs up.

231
00:11:31.571 --> 00:11:34.890
If you think that the pyramids of Giza were built to be something other than a

232
00:11:34.891 --> 00:11:37.810
burial chamber for the pharaohs. Anyways, guys, I'm Jimmy.

233
00:11:38.080 --> 00:11:38.960
This is bright insight.

234
00:11:39.080 --> 00:11:42.480
I have many other videos to come and a whole wide variety of topics. Take care,

235
00:11:42.481 --> 00:11:42.880
everybody.
