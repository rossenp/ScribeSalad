00:00:00.620 --> 00:00:03.680
<v 0>Hey everybody. It's Jimmy again, with bright insight today,</v>

2
00:00:03.780 --> 00:00:08.200
I'm gonna talk with you about the pyramids of Egypt and how literally what we

3
00:00:08.201 --> 00:00:12.800
were taught in school and what is still actively being taught in public

4
00:00:12.801 --> 00:00:17.800
schools. And at the university level is completely inaccurate. For example,

5
00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:21.350
the great pyramid of Giza has to 2 million,

6
00:00:21.880 --> 00:00:25.710
300,000 stone blocks. And by the way, that's just an estimate.

7
00:00:25.711 --> 00:00:27.670
<v 1>I've heard estimates as much as 2.6 million,</v>

8
00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:33.150
but these blocks range anywhere from two to 80 tons, eight zero,

9
00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:38.350
do the math on that. Guys, we're talking 160,000 pounds stone blocks or,

10
00:00:38.710 --> 00:00:40.710
or as little as 4,000 pounds, of course,

11
00:00:42.040 --> 00:00:46.020
and these stone blocks are made from granite limestone and bass salt,

12
00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:47.180
a combination of it.

13
00:00:47.560 --> 00:00:51.900
And they originate from the Aswan and elephantine island quarries,

14
00:00:51.950 --> 00:00:55.860
which are located literally 500 miles away.

15
00:00:56.920 --> 00:01:00.580
Now I there's many theories on how they were able to transport.

16
00:01:00.710 --> 00:01:04.650
<v 0>These have stone blocks from such an extreme distance,</v>

17
00:01:04.950 --> 00:01:07.810
but that's something we'll cover in another video because I have some things

18
00:01:07.811 --> 00:01:11.370
that are far more interesting to discuss that will make your heads absolutely

19
00:01:11.500 --> 00:01:16.130
blown with this, with these facts that you probably have not heard before. Now,

20
00:01:16.131 --> 00:01:20.850
these 2.3 million stone blocks are all various different sizes

21
00:01:21.170 --> 00:01:24.640
and dimensions that they weren't just one offset. They were able to manufacture,

22
00:01:24.670 --> 00:01:27.920
okay, this one is this size, or we're gonna make a million of these. No,

23
00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:28.561
in fact,

24
00:01:28.561 --> 00:01:33.120
they fit in and they have a very unique fitting for each individual block that

25
00:01:33.121 --> 00:01:34.680
they're not just stacked on top of each other,

26
00:01:34.900 --> 00:01:39.120
but they're intertwined to create an incredible force of stability and

27
00:01:39.121 --> 00:01:43.910
interlocking connectiveness. Now the great pyramid of GI of sits on 13 acres.

28
00:01:44.300 --> 00:01:46.230
It's nearly 500 feet tall,

29
00:01:46.570 --> 00:01:50.630
and each of its bases is more than 750 feet long.

30
00:01:51.670 --> 00:01:55.070
Interesting fact that you probably haven't heard before is that the ratio of the

31
00:01:55.110 --> 00:01:57.270
pyramids height to its circumference at,

32
00:01:57.370 --> 00:02:02.070
at its base is equal to the value of pie. 3.14,

33
00:02:02.580 --> 00:02:05.780
just a coincidence. Uh, I doubt it now,

34
00:02:05.781 --> 00:02:08.620
something else that's very interesting is that if you were to take a 9,000

35
00:02:08.630 --> 00:02:09.940
pound, uh,

36
00:02:09.941 --> 00:02:13.620
pyramid stone and say that it's about three and a half feet by three and a half

37
00:02:13.621 --> 00:02:17.620
feet, which IST uncommon to find it would take literally,

38
00:02:17.760 --> 00:02:21.220
if you were to unload this, if, if, if men did this without machinery,

39
00:02:21.221 --> 00:02:24.010
like they want us to believe like, you know, as a bunch of slaves do this,

40
00:02:24.350 --> 00:02:27.770
if you were to have three people on each side and keep in mind,

41
00:02:27.771 --> 00:02:29.970
we're talking a three and a half foot dimension,

42
00:02:30.070 --> 00:02:32.650
but if you could fit three people on each side of three and a half feet,

43
00:02:32.651 --> 00:02:33.730
which would be a tight squeeze,

44
00:02:34.040 --> 00:02:38.890
each individual person would be lifting more than 900 pounds. Hmm.

45
00:02:39.360 --> 00:02:42.970
That doesn't sound right. Does it? Here's another interesting fact.

46
00:02:43.110 --> 00:02:47.960
If you could cut carve shape in place 10 stones a day,

47
00:02:48.620 --> 00:02:53.200
it would take more than 664 years to make just

48
00:02:53.940 --> 00:02:58.400
one pyramid. Guys. We're talking, moving these things, cutting and shaping them,

49
00:02:58.401 --> 00:03:01.120
moving them over 500 miles. And by the way,

50
00:03:01.180 --> 00:03:04.160
you have to place them precisely because the,

51
00:03:04.300 --> 00:03:09.000
to make a pyramid requires extremely advanced mathematical formulas and

52
00:03:09.200 --> 00:03:11.720
equations. Because if you don't place them precisely,

53
00:03:11.721 --> 00:03:13.320
by the time you get to the top, you don't have a pyramid,

54
00:03:13.380 --> 00:03:16.600
you have a cork screw shaped mess, and you're completely screwed.

55
00:03:17.110 --> 00:03:21.230
Another interesting fact that many people are not aware of is that mainstream

56
00:03:21.670 --> 00:03:23.990
Egyptian antiquities want you to believe that the,

57
00:03:24.010 --> 00:03:27.030
the pyramids were utilized for tombs. That's what they were. They were tombs.

58
00:03:27.031 --> 00:03:30.350
However, they never found tombs inside the pyramids. Yeah, look it up.

59
00:03:31.090 --> 00:03:33.910
But what's more interesting is the fact that the amazing,

60
00:03:34.090 --> 00:03:38.150
the absolutely amazing QIC capabilities that are within the pyramids within the

61
00:03:38.151 --> 00:03:40.900
galleries and the various like Queens chamber, for example,

62
00:03:41.170 --> 00:03:42.260
like literally YouTube,

63
00:03:42.261 --> 00:03:47.100
this the QIC are so unbelievably impressive that there's no way that this was an

64
00:03:47.300 --> 00:03:50.140
accident. Look it up. Now here's a big question.

65
00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:55.740
Why would anyone go to such an incredible task of building even just one

66
00:03:55.741 --> 00:03:59.380
pyramid? Like, could we even do this today? Well, okay. Yeah. People say yes,

67
00:03:59.600 --> 00:04:04.050
sure. We could, but what would it take? How much money would that project cost?

68
00:04:04.550 --> 00:04:07.890
Not only would it be the most expensive and most elaborate project ever

69
00:04:08.170 --> 00:04:09.970
constructed, but in, in modern times.

70
00:04:10.230 --> 00:04:13.090
But I could say that no one could afford to do it because it would cost an

71
00:04:13.110 --> 00:04:14.730
untold amount of billions of dollars.

72
00:04:15.110 --> 00:04:19.290
It would require an unbelievable amount of manpower and effort.

73
00:04:19.850 --> 00:04:24.440
A what, what union are they gonna hire to get this done? Like literally, if you,

74
00:04:24.500 --> 00:04:27.240
if it takes four years to build a modern baseball stadium,

75
00:04:27.920 --> 00:04:29.560
like what do you think it takes to make a pyramid?

76
00:04:29.700 --> 00:04:31.160
And when you look at these pictures, guys,

77
00:04:31.500 --> 00:04:36.360
the precision that's necessary to form these pyramids and do what they did or to

78
00:04:36.361 --> 00:04:40.870
even have the internal chambers constructed within the pyramids and the shapes

79
00:04:40.990 --> 00:04:45.510
in the stones to interlock the way they do requires such unbelievable precision

80
00:04:45.750 --> 00:04:49.430
and accuracy, that it is mind numbing and to be able to construct and,

81
00:04:49.670 --> 00:04:54.230
and make this thing happen today. Well, it it's kind of farfetched in many,

82
00:04:54.231 --> 00:04:55.270
many ways. Now,

83
00:04:55.271 --> 00:04:59.390
another interesting fact is the alignment of true north with the great pyramid

84
00:04:59.650 --> 00:05:04.500
and that it's within an of three sixtieths of a degree of error of being

85
00:05:04.501 --> 00:05:06.060
perfectly aligned to true north. Now,

86
00:05:06.061 --> 00:05:09.740
we do know that because of the procession of the earth and it's tilt, uh,

87
00:05:09.741 --> 00:05:12.420
over time, that true north does change. We know this.

88
00:05:13.120 --> 00:05:17.100
So what's interesting is that it must have been at one point aligned perfectly

89
00:05:17.101 --> 00:05:21.020
to true north seeing is how accurate it is today. That's pretty amazing guys.

90
00:05:21.500 --> 00:05:25.130
What, what we were told about ancient civilization is far,

91
00:05:25.550 --> 00:05:27.970
far more complicated than what we ever imagined,

92
00:05:28.070 --> 00:05:32.610
and that they had to have some sort of advanced technology or,

93
00:05:32.810 --> 00:05:34.570
or machinery in order to construct the pyramid.

94
00:05:34.910 --> 00:05:38.170
And the evidence is all over the place. Anyways, guys, I'm Jimmy,

95
00:05:38.171 --> 00:05:40.450
this is bright insight like, and subscribe.

96
00:05:40.530 --> 00:05:42.960
I have many more videos for you to enjoy and, and have many more coming,

97
00:05:43.460 --> 00:05:44.240
be blessed, all.
