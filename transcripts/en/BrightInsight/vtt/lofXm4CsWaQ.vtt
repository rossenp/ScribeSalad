00:00:01.550 --> 00:00:04.550
<v 0>We are without a doubt, a species with amnesia.</v>

2
00:00:04.820 --> 00:00:07.910
When you look at stories that are making headlines around the world right now

3
00:00:07.911 --> 00:00:11.570
with human skeletal remains dating back 300,000 years,

4
00:00:11.571 --> 00:00:16.370
which is more than 100,000 years earlier than ever previously discovered.

5
00:00:16.700 --> 00:00:21.170
Now, real quick, I was going to make a video on this topic alone, but I mean,

6
00:00:21.260 --> 00:00:24.260
look, here's the key takeaway. The skeleton remains that they have found,

7
00:00:24.261 --> 00:00:28.400
which is just bits and pieces of a few different bodies are not exactly the same

8
00:00:28.401 --> 00:00:30.620
as modern humans. So I mean,

9
00:00:30.621 --> 00:00:34.160
it raises far more questions than answers and although the story is incredibly

10
00:00:34.161 --> 00:00:37.430
interesting, I would rather you just research it on your own, um,

11
00:00:37.460 --> 00:00:40.220
because here's the point that I really want to make, which is,

12
00:00:40.250 --> 00:00:44.780
do you wonder why or how is it that modern humans just as we are today,

13
00:00:44.781 --> 00:00:48.020
which we know date back about 150,000 years. I mean,

14
00:00:48.021 --> 00:00:49.520
there's plenty of evidence of that.

15
00:00:49.670 --> 00:00:52.670
There's some evidence dating back 190,000 years,

16
00:00:52.970 --> 00:00:55.820
but what this story going back 300,000 years? Well,

17
00:00:56.060 --> 00:00:58.670
the brain cavity is not exactly the same. Even the, the,

18
00:00:58.671 --> 00:01:02.030
the skull is not shaped the same way as we are today.

19
00:01:02.420 --> 00:01:05.150
And that's not to say it's not interesting, but here's my point.

20
00:01:06.050 --> 00:01:07.700
Why is it in just the last,

21
00:01:07.970 --> 00:01:12.920
not even 10 generations alone and by a generation I'm saying 25 years that we've

22
00:01:12.921 --> 00:01:17.690
gone from having almost no technology whatsoever to well going to the steam

23
00:01:17.691 --> 00:01:21.470
engine to where we are today. I mean, we really are a species with them, Nisha.

24
00:01:21.500 --> 00:01:24.440
I mean, just look at the fact that, that story and I made a video on this,

25
00:01:24.620 --> 00:01:26.150
but in April of this year,

26
00:01:26.270 --> 00:01:30.620
they found those Mastodon bones that show evidence of humans existing in north

27
00:01:30.621 --> 00:01:32.720
America, 130,000 years ago,

28
00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:37.190
which is what 115,000 years previously to what we ever thought possible.

29
00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:39.680
Let me read you a quote by Graham Hancock.

30
00:01:40.160 --> 00:01:43.310
My sense is that we are missing a huge part of the human story.

31
00:01:43.670 --> 00:01:45.320
I think it's possible indeed,

32
00:01:45.321 --> 00:01:50.180
probable that we are a species with amnesia that we've lost the record of our

33
00:01:50.181 --> 00:01:54.500
story going back thousands of years before so-called history began.

34
00:01:54.890 --> 00:01:57.410
And I think that if we could go back to that dark epoch,

35
00:01:57.620 --> 00:02:01.160
we would discover many astounding things about ourselves. I mean,

36
00:02:01.161 --> 00:02:01.911
just think about it.

37
00:02:01.911 --> 00:02:06.500
Human history recorded history dates back approximately 6,000 years.

38
00:02:06.680 --> 00:02:10.160
And there's just so much, we don't know about 6,000 years ago,

39
00:02:10.161 --> 00:02:11.990
it's full of holes and mystery.

40
00:02:12.350 --> 00:02:15.560
And that's just the earliest that we know of where there was human writing and

41
00:02:15.561 --> 00:02:18.050
other things. But so, I mean,

42
00:02:18.051 --> 00:02:21.620
if you take a generation being 25 years, well,

43
00:02:21.621 --> 00:02:26.510
6,000 years ago is 240 generations to get from recorded

44
00:02:26.511 --> 00:02:28.160
history to where we are today.

45
00:02:28.700 --> 00:02:32.960
Now look at just what we've accomplished in the last five generations. I mean,

46
00:02:32.961 --> 00:02:37.190
from the year 1900 to today, holy crap has this world changed quite a bit.

47
00:02:37.490 --> 00:02:39.680
So the question is why on earth?

48
00:02:39.681 --> 00:02:44.030
Did it take 150,000 years to get to where we are today?

49
00:02:44.900 --> 00:02:46.670
You know what, let's use a calculator real quick.

50
00:02:46.671 --> 00:02:51.470
How many generations ago is it from 150,000 years to

51
00:02:51.471 --> 00:02:53.900
today? And again, a generation being 25 years.

52
00:02:54.710 --> 00:02:59.710
I don't know if you can see that 6,000 generations like holy

53
00:02:59.711 --> 00:03:04.030
crap. And if those skeleton remains from, you know, 300,000 years ago, I mean,

54
00:03:04.031 --> 00:03:07.270
guys, that, that means 12,000 generations have gone by,

55
00:03:07.390 --> 00:03:10.090
and it's taken us this long to get to where we are today.

56
00:03:10.240 --> 00:03:11.530
When it's only been what,

57
00:03:11.620 --> 00:03:15.010
not even 10 generations to go from the steam engine to where we are today.

58
00:03:15.490 --> 00:03:18.640
If you're not familiar with Randall Carlson, look into him,

59
00:03:18.641 --> 00:03:22.270
he has sacred geometry, international.com. He has some YouTube videos.

60
00:03:22.420 --> 00:03:24.010
This guy is an absolute genius.

61
00:03:24.070 --> 00:03:28.210
He does tons of research on geology and various cataclysms that have happened on

62
00:03:28.211 --> 00:03:28.810
earth.

63
00:03:28.810 --> 00:03:33.220
And the evidence is overwhelming that indeed the earth goes through cycles of

64
00:03:33.221 --> 00:03:34.060
catastrophe.

65
00:03:34.420 --> 00:03:39.370
And what he's identified is that over say just the last 150,000 years

66
00:03:39.371 --> 00:03:42.310
that we know humans as they are today have existed.

67
00:03:42.730 --> 00:03:46.360
There's been approximately 16 events. Well, I should say no,

68
00:03:46.361 --> 00:03:50.710
there's been at least 16 events that have been so extreme that if they happen

69
00:03:50.711 --> 00:03:51.544
today,

70
00:03:51.550 --> 00:03:56.140
they would result in the total destruction of at least 1000 cities,

71
00:03:56.290 --> 00:03:59.710
thus, you know, setting back human civilization back to the stone age,

72
00:04:00.160 --> 00:04:02.890
but to be even more specific and kind of disturbing,

73
00:04:03.280 --> 00:04:07.630
there seems to be reoccurring cataclysms every 13,000 years,

74
00:04:07.810 --> 00:04:11.770
for example, 26,000 years is when the ice age started.

75
00:04:12.190 --> 00:04:15.040
And 13,000 years ago is when it abruptly ended.

76
00:04:15.430 --> 00:04:17.500
And although these cataclysms w you know,

77
00:04:17.650 --> 00:04:22.000
the very such as the Toba super eruption that happened 72,000 years ago,

78
00:04:22.180 --> 00:04:26.710
or 144,000 years ago, there was a salient climate shift. I mean,

79
00:04:26.711 --> 00:04:31.690
we know that there's been at least five occurrences of massive changes in global

80
00:04:31.691 --> 00:04:36.250
temperature and 400 foot rises and falls of sea level dating back several

81
00:04:36.251 --> 00:04:39.910
hundred thousand years. But here's where it gets really interesting right now,

82
00:04:39.970 --> 00:04:41.980
as it is today in 2017,

83
00:04:42.490 --> 00:04:46.120
we are in the longest period of time without a major event of this magnitude

84
00:04:46.300 --> 00:04:50.050
than there ever has been over the last 150,000 years.

85
00:04:50.290 --> 00:04:55.030
So even though there's been 16 massive events over the last 150,000 years,

86
00:04:55.031 --> 00:04:57.400
that we know humans as they are today have existed.

87
00:04:57.970 --> 00:05:00.460
We're in the longest period of time without another one of these events.

88
00:05:00.461 --> 00:05:03.340
And there's been 16 over that period of time. So in other words,

89
00:05:03.341 --> 00:05:06.370
what I'm saying is that we are long overdue and again,

90
00:05:06.400 --> 00:05:08.950
look into the works of Randall Carlson. Um,

91
00:05:08.980 --> 00:05:10.780
but this information is worth sharing,

92
00:05:10.810 --> 00:05:13.900
but once you start to dig into this for yourself, in fact, check this guy,

93
00:05:13.901 --> 00:05:17.140
Randall Carlson, holy crap, is he onto something?

94
00:05:17.141 --> 00:05:20.920
And it raises so many questions on why isn't the mainstream picking up on this.

95
00:05:20.950 --> 00:05:22.810
Now he's not the only person talking about it,

96
00:05:23.080 --> 00:05:25.960
but ultimately the masses aren't aware of this. And it's key.

97
00:05:25.961 --> 00:05:29.650
It's so crucial because humanity guys look bottom line is this.

98
00:05:29.680 --> 00:05:33.070
We are absolutely going to have another massive cataclysmic event,

99
00:05:33.071 --> 00:05:37.780
whether it's a rock from outer space or a geo geomagnetic pole shift,

100
00:05:37.930 --> 00:05:39.250
or who knows what,

101
00:05:39.550 --> 00:05:43.200
what we know is that there are cycles of catastrophe here on earth that seemed

102
00:05:43.201 --> 00:05:45.790
to happen in cycles. And as you look at this wheel here,

103
00:05:45.940 --> 00:05:49.090
this cosmic cycles of 26,000 years,

104
00:05:49.091 --> 00:05:53.230
this whole wheel is actually 25,920 years, which is a cycle.

105
00:05:53.231 --> 00:05:55.480
It was identified by the Mayans. Am I wrong?

106
00:05:55.840 --> 00:06:00.650
But there appears to be massive in climate every 13,000 years and other smaller

107
00:06:00.651 --> 00:06:01.071
changes,

108
00:06:01.071 --> 00:06:05.150
although extreme enough to kill off a thousand cities that happen every 6,000

109
00:06:05.151 --> 00:06:07.610
years. So where am I going with this? Well,

110
00:06:07.670 --> 00:06:10.820
I'm not saying that we're all going to die. This isn't a doomsday video.

111
00:06:10.910 --> 00:06:13.520
I'm not suggesting that something's going to happen in our lifetime.

112
00:06:14.030 --> 00:06:16.640
Although I am definitely doing some research. There are some really,

113
00:06:16.641 --> 00:06:21.500
really interesting cosmic events happening in 2017, not just the solar eclipse,

114
00:06:21.860 --> 00:06:23.060
but where the, uh,

115
00:06:23.300 --> 00:06:26.450
co star constellations will be in relation to the pyramids and the Sphinx,

116
00:06:26.750 --> 00:06:30.680
as well as the fact that you have the sun rising and Sagittarius on the winter

117
00:06:30.681 --> 00:06:33.200
solstice 1221, 2017,

118
00:06:33.380 --> 00:06:35.450
which is really interesting because he had the Mayan calendar,

119
00:06:35.451 --> 00:06:37.370
all that nonsense from 2012,

120
00:06:37.400 --> 00:06:40.880
but there was really no evidence back then to suggest that anything was going to

121
00:06:40.881 --> 00:06:43.850
happen. Now, hold on. I'm not saying that something's happening this year.

122
00:06:44.210 --> 00:06:47.060
What I'm trying to say is this for every justice,

123
00:06:47.300 --> 00:06:51.140
Randall Carlson said for every generation that passes by for every say a hundred

124
00:06:51.141 --> 00:06:51.974
years or so,

125
00:06:52.040 --> 00:06:56.270
that passes by that say the probability of the next major event,

126
00:06:56.630 --> 00:06:58.040
just skyrockets. Because again,

127
00:06:58.041 --> 00:07:01.370
we're at the longest period of time without a major event than there has been

128
00:07:01.371 --> 00:07:05.270
over the last 150,000 years. And we already know that there's been 16 events.

129
00:07:05.271 --> 00:07:07.880
So you see where I'm going with this, we're a long overdue.

130
00:07:08.240 --> 00:07:12.170
So the important thing is that humanity needs to set ourselves up for success.

131
00:07:12.171 --> 00:07:15.110
So ultimately when the next major cataclysm happens,

132
00:07:15.380 --> 00:07:18.620
we don't have to start over from the fricking stone age. Again, we all make,

133
00:07:18.621 --> 00:07:21.350
I mean, oh my God, like, look at what we know about history.

134
00:07:21.351 --> 00:07:24.980
Just going back 6,000 years is pretty, I mean, it's been full of war.

135
00:07:24.980 --> 00:07:28.760
It's been full of all kinds of issues and nonsense, and it would really,

136
00:07:28.761 --> 00:07:31.580
really suck for humanity to have to do that all over again.

137
00:07:31.581 --> 00:07:34.250
And although we may not be able to prevent a capitalism,

138
00:07:34.490 --> 00:07:39.170
we can certainly take precautions in order to ensure the survival of the human

139
00:07:39.171 --> 00:07:39.441
race.

140
00:07:39.441 --> 00:07:42.380
And that when I say that I'm not suggesting that the human race would go extinct

141
00:07:42.381 --> 00:07:45.200
from any cataclysm. I mean, honestly, humans are kind of like,

142
00:07:46.370 --> 00:07:48.410
forgive me for saying kind of like roaches. I mean, we can,

143
00:07:48.470 --> 00:07:51.560
if something happens on the other side of the world, we can be like, holy crap,

144
00:07:51.590 --> 00:07:54.080
let me go hide in this cave. Now you see what I'm saying?

145
00:07:54.081 --> 00:07:56.630
So I'm not worried about the human race going extinct,

146
00:07:56.840 --> 00:08:00.110
but rather starting over from scratch for the stone age is going to cause all

147
00:08:00.111 --> 00:08:03.140
kinds of unnecessary, oh man,

148
00:08:03.170 --> 00:08:07.250
anguish and pain and suffering for the humans that lie in our future for our

149
00:08:07.251 --> 00:08:09.260
kids, for our grandkids or great, great, great.

150
00:08:10.160 --> 00:08:12.380
Great-grandkids it's going to happen far sooner than we think.

151
00:08:12.381 --> 00:08:15.530
And I encourage anyone to leave me a comment with any, you know,

152
00:08:15.531 --> 00:08:16.610
investigation they've done,

153
00:08:16.611 --> 00:08:20.840
because there's all kinds of things going around the internet about September

154
00:08:20.840 --> 00:08:21.680
23rd, 2017 and all these other things.

155
00:08:21.681 --> 00:08:25.790
But all I know is that I'm not a doomsday guy, but I do look at data.

156
00:08:25.880 --> 00:08:29.360
And the data shows that there's some really interesting cosmic events happening,

157
00:08:29.870 --> 00:08:32.540
uh, in the near future. So it's worth looking at, but, uh,

158
00:08:32.570 --> 00:08:36.410
the bottom line is that every 13,000 years there appears to be some massive

159
00:08:36.411 --> 00:08:40.550
changes in climate. So it's time that we start looking into this. And again,

160
00:08:40.551 --> 00:08:44.420
I'm not a discouraging people from engaging in climate change debates,

161
00:08:44.870 --> 00:08:49.850
but we really need to include what the earth is doing all by itself without

162
00:08:49.851 --> 00:08:52.160
us thousands, tens of thousands,

163
00:08:52.161 --> 00:08:55.100
hundreds of thousands of years prior to the industrial revolution.

164
00:08:55.500 --> 00:08:58.100
<v 1>I'll leave it at that. Leave me a comment. Let me know what your thoughts are.</v>

165
00:08:58.120 --> 00:09:01.020
Any information that you have to share on this really interesting topic,

166
00:09:01.560 --> 00:09:03.780
but I'll leave it at that. I'm Jimmy, this is bright insight like,

167
00:09:03.781 --> 00:09:04.531
and subscribe.

168
00:09:04.531 --> 00:09:07.410
And I have many other videos to come on a whole wide variety of topics.

169
