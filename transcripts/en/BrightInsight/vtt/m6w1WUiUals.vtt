00:00:00.780 --> 00:00:05.100
<v 0>Under no circumstances should anything from our ancient past be kept hidden from</v>

2
00:00:05.101 --> 00:00:06.630
the public. However,

3
00:00:06.631 --> 00:00:09.990
the never before seen photos and video that I'm going to share with,

4
00:00:09.991 --> 00:00:14.190
you will prove that we, the general public have not been shown.

5
00:00:14.191 --> 00:00:19.020
Everything that there is to know you see the great Sphinx of Giza Egypt has long

6
00:00:19.021 --> 00:00:21.390
been subject of debate with many theories,

7
00:00:21.391 --> 00:00:25.590
suggesting that there are perhaps secret tunnels and chambers located within an

8
00:00:25.610 --> 00:00:29.760
under this mysterious ancient archeological site between legends of the

9
00:00:29.761 --> 00:00:33.300
so-called hall of records or the modern scientific data,

10
00:00:33.301 --> 00:00:36.960
which has identified possible chambers that are under and within the Sphinx.

11
00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:42.150
And even this notable off limits passage located at the back end of the

12
00:00:42.151 --> 00:00:42.984
monument,

13
00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:47.130
which has long generated intense desire by many to know what's down there.

14
00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:52.260
You see this was discovered and excavated in the 1970s by world renowned

15
00:00:52.290 --> 00:00:56.610
Egyptologists, Zahid [inaudible] and mark Lainer. In fact, real quick,

16
00:00:56.611 --> 00:00:58.290
you have to see the short clip about it.

17
00:00:59.310 --> 00:01:03.780
<v 1>It began with an old worker who remembered a secret tunnel in the Sphinx is rum.</v>

18
00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:10.890
They removed a single stone from just to the left of the sphinxes tail.

19
00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:13.913
<v 3>And sure enough,</v>

20
00:01:14.370 --> 00:01:18.720
we saw this path going down in and under this things.

21
00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:22.260
<v 1>They descended into the shop.</v>

22
00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:27.450
<v 3>Of course we didn't know where it was going to go.</v>

23
00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:32.790
And so three weeks I spent down in the darkness

24
00:01:33.510 --> 00:01:35.160
underneath the grades things.

25
00:01:39.660 --> 00:01:41.190
<v 2>We so should everywhere,</v>

26
00:01:42.120 --> 00:01:45.090
but there is nothing hidden underneath.

27
00:01:48.330 --> 00:01:49.560
<v 0>So just to clarify,</v>

28
00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:53.520
they spent an entire three weeks excavating an empty tunnel.

29
00:01:53.760 --> 00:01:56.250
So this is the part where things get weird,

30
00:01:56.280 --> 00:02:00.450
because you should know that these still images from the clip you just saw are

31
00:02:00.451 --> 00:02:04.050
quite literally the only examples of this tunnel that have been ever made

32
00:02:04.051 --> 00:02:08.130
available to the public and notice that they do not show where that tunnel goes.

33
00:02:08.131 --> 00:02:12.360
And in fact, we see nothing more than the entrance of the tunnel itself,

34
00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:13.740
but not only that,

35
00:02:13.770 --> 00:02:18.660
the original 16 page report on the excavation of this tunnel only includes these

36
00:02:18.661 --> 00:02:22.620
pictures and illustrations that you're seeing here. This is it.

37
00:02:22.650 --> 00:02:27.030
And half of them are from outside of the Sphinx. But so what I mean,

38
00:02:27.031 --> 00:02:29.730
they assured us that there's nothing down there anyways, right?

39
00:02:30.480 --> 00:02:32.100
<v 2>We so should every everywhere,</v>

40
00:02:33.030 --> 00:02:36.000
but it is nothing hidden underneath.

41
00:02:37.680 --> 00:02:40.590
<v 0>Whoa, wait a second. Oh, what was that last part? He said.</v>

42
00:02:41.190 --> 00:02:46.020
<v 2>But there is nothing hidden underneath nothing hidden</v>

43
00:02:46.260 --> 00:02:49.080
underneath, underneath, underneath.

44
00:02:50.010 --> 00:02:52.560
<v 0>Nothing hidden underneath. Well,</v>

45
00:02:52.590 --> 00:02:55.350
those words are about to become quite interesting,

46
00:02:55.590 --> 00:02:57.630
especially the underneath part.

47
00:02:58.020 --> 00:03:02.230
Now I can neither confirm nor deny were these photos or videos I'm about to

48
00:03:02.231 --> 00:03:06.160
share with you came from, but I can say with absolute truth that no,

49
00:03:06.161 --> 00:03:07.690
this is not me and no,

50
00:03:07.691 --> 00:03:12.070
I did not take any of the photos or videos that you're about to see nor was I in

51
00:03:12.071 --> 00:03:14.950
the country of Egypt when they were taken, however,

52
00:03:14.951 --> 00:03:19.390
a few brave and cunning men took great risk to climb down into the back end of

53
00:03:19.391 --> 00:03:22.870
the Sphinx at a moment when the overseeing Egyptian authorities were

54
00:03:22.871 --> 00:03:23.770
preoccupied,

55
00:03:24.160 --> 00:03:27.490
these gentlemen only had a few seconds before they were ultimately caught.

56
00:03:27.520 --> 00:03:31.030
However, the photos and short video clips successfully made it out.

57
00:03:31.031 --> 00:03:32.890
So first things first,

58
00:03:33.100 --> 00:03:37.180
let me play the two video clips before I show you the photos as the video clips

59
00:03:37.300 --> 00:03:40.900
will set the stage for what the pictures are going to reveal to all of us.

60
00:03:56.260 --> 00:03:57.093
<v 4>[Inaudible].</v>

61
00:03:57.670 --> 00:03:58.870
<v 0>Now real quick.</v>

62
00:03:58.900 --> 00:04:02.350
I removed just a few seconds of the clip to conceal this man's identity,

63
00:04:02.351 --> 00:04:04.450
but here are the last few seconds.

64
00:04:07.540 --> 00:04:08.373
<v 5>No, no.</v>

65
00:04:10.420 --> 00:04:14.530
<v 0>And as you could probably tell that is when they were caught. Now,</v>

66
00:04:14.560 --> 00:04:16.180
here is the second clip,

67
00:04:16.420 --> 00:04:20.020
which is of the second gentleman who was already down in the second tier at the

68
00:04:20.021 --> 00:04:23.170
same time as the other man was climbing down as you just saw.

69
00:04:24.640 --> 00:04:26.470
<v 6>Okay. So that's the good end</v>

70
00:04:28.750 --> 00:04:33.430
here we are under the Spanx and one of the forbidden holes.

71
00:04:39.190 --> 00:04:40.023
<v 7>Down.</v>

72
00:04:42.460 --> 00:04:46.270
<v 0>No, obviously the video was recorded in great haste and doesn't show us a lot.</v>

73
00:04:46.271 --> 00:04:50.020
However, there are a few important details that we just learned,

74
00:04:50.410 --> 00:04:53.830
but let me first point out that you cannot see the entrance of this tunnel when

75
00:04:53.831 --> 00:04:55.750
looking down from the outside of the Sphinx,

76
00:04:56.050 --> 00:04:59.230
as it's below the first tier and too far to the left.

77
00:04:59.830 --> 00:05:03.400
Another thing we observed is that we never had witnessed where this tunnel goes

78
00:05:03.401 --> 00:05:07.210
or what it even looks like within it, but it is indeed a dead end.

79
00:05:07.211 --> 00:05:10.030
So when [inaudible] was said, there is nothing underneath,

80
00:05:10.360 --> 00:05:14.230
he was apparently telling the truth, at least at this particular location,

81
00:05:14.770 --> 00:05:19.090
but this is where things get very interesting because he did not say anything

82
00:05:19.091 --> 00:05:22.630
about there being nothing inside of the Sphinx and the photos you're going to

83
00:05:22.631 --> 00:05:27.610
see next are of a previously unknown tunnel that proceed up and inside

84
00:05:27.611 --> 00:05:28.990
of the Sphinx itself.

85
00:05:29.050 --> 00:05:33.130
And these images are the first ever of their kinds to be seen by the public or

86
00:05:33.131 --> 00:05:35.920
even posted to the internet. For that matter. In fact,

87
00:05:35.921 --> 00:05:39.640
I have waited and many others have waited years to see what these photos are

88
00:05:39.641 --> 00:05:43.120
about to reveal to us first, notice this frame here,

89
00:05:43.360 --> 00:05:46.030
which is from the last few moments of the prior clip,

90
00:05:46.360 --> 00:05:50.650
you see that this is a second tunnel that goes up and in and is facing towards

91
00:05:50.651 --> 00:05:52.540
the front of the Sphinx or to the east.

92
00:05:53.080 --> 00:05:56.230
This is something that you can not see from the outside of the Sphinx,

93
00:05:56.231 --> 00:05:59.420
either as it is too high and too far in to be observed,

94
00:05:59.450 --> 00:06:02.480
even if you're peaking your head in from the outside passage.

95
00:06:03.050 --> 00:06:07.040
And thankfully this cunning gentlemen captured a three photos of this second

96
00:06:07.041 --> 00:06:09.530
tunnel and you can see straight inside of it,

97
00:06:09.531 --> 00:06:13.550
which is a passage that proceeds up and towards the front of the Sphinx and has

98
00:06:13.551 --> 00:06:15.830
quite literally been boarded up.

99
00:06:16.310 --> 00:06:19.640
And I have to say that the first thing I thought of when I saw these photos is

100
00:06:19.641 --> 00:06:21.140
the ground radar image here,

101
00:06:21.141 --> 00:06:24.290
which identifies two possible cavities within the Sphinx,

102
00:06:24.620 --> 00:06:28.370
which are in the same direction that this boarded up tunnel proceeds.

103
00:06:28.850 --> 00:06:29.631
Unfortunately,

104
00:06:29.631 --> 00:06:33.530
we cannot see much that is beyond the boards and I can not tell which direction

105
00:06:33.531 --> 00:06:34.490
it goes from there.

106
00:06:34.820 --> 00:06:38.270
Perhaps it proceeds into a second tier above or another direction.

107
00:06:38.271 --> 00:06:39.590
We just can't tell.

108
00:06:40.040 --> 00:06:44.510
But what I do know is that this particular tunnel was not shown or discussed by

109
00:06:44.511 --> 00:06:46.910
the world's two most renowned Egyptologists,

110
00:06:47.090 --> 00:06:50.930
where they specifically stated that there is nothing underneath yet.

111
00:06:50.931 --> 00:06:54.740
They mentioned nothing in reference to tunnels within the Spanx itself.

112
00:06:55.010 --> 00:06:58.550
Perhaps this would explain why they spent an entire three weeks exploring the

113
00:06:58.551 --> 00:07:03.170
bowels of the Sphinx, which we can now see includes far more than just an empty,

114
00:07:03.500 --> 00:07:05.660
dead end tunnel. And you know,

115
00:07:05.690 --> 00:07:09.950
all of this becomes even more interesting when we consider that there is another

116
00:07:09.951 --> 00:07:12.170
vertical shaft at the top of the Sphinx.

117
00:07:12.530 --> 00:07:15.110
This is something that I discussed in a video a few years ago,

118
00:07:15.111 --> 00:07:16.760
but as you can see here,

119
00:07:16.790 --> 00:07:20.510
Zahid wasps himself shows us a trapdoor on the sphinxes back,

120
00:07:20.660 --> 00:07:24.950
which drops straight down yet. You simply cannot see where it goes from there,

121
00:07:24.951 --> 00:07:29.270
but something is now telling me that is likely connects to the hidden tunnel,

122
00:07:29.300 --> 00:07:31.670
which we now know leads in the same direction.

123
00:07:32.090 --> 00:07:34.310
And for whatever it's worth Zahi claimed again,

124
00:07:34.311 --> 00:07:37.910
that there is nothing down here either just as he claimed that there is nothing

125
00:07:37.911 --> 00:07:38.930
under the Sphinx.

126
00:07:39.140 --> 00:07:42.530
But I have to say that I am not at all convinced about that as ground radar has

127
00:07:42.531 --> 00:07:45.950
shown multiple anomalies. As you can see from these examples here,

128
00:07:46.220 --> 00:07:48.800
which are located under the Sphinx towards the backend,

129
00:07:48.860 --> 00:07:52.370
as well as under the sphinxes left pot or right pause, you're facing it.

130
00:07:52.400 --> 00:07:55.670
But although these photos and videos are shared with you today,

131
00:07:55.671 --> 00:07:57.920
leave us with many unanswered questions.

132
00:07:58.190 --> 00:08:01.220
I have to say that I am thrilled to have personally witnessed and been able to

133
00:08:01.221 --> 00:08:02.600
share these details with you.

134
00:08:03.140 --> 00:08:06.380
And if you're wondering why others haven't successfully snuck down into this

135
00:08:06.381 --> 00:08:09.080
passage and captured pictures or videos sooner,

136
00:08:09.380 --> 00:08:13.250
it's related to the fact that this entire area around the Sphinx is off limits.

137
00:08:13.400 --> 00:08:15.200
And this you have special access permission,

138
00:08:15.500 --> 00:08:19.610
which costs thousands of dollars and is overseen by tour guides and armed guards

139
00:08:19.611 --> 00:08:20.690
at all times.

140
00:08:21.110 --> 00:08:24.950
Everyone else is only able to view the sings from the top of its enclosure,

141
00:08:25.520 --> 00:08:26.690
but make no mistake.

142
00:08:26.750 --> 00:08:31.160
Every one of us has an inherent rights as people to see and know the details of

143
00:08:31.161 --> 00:08:34.460
our lost ancient past. I don't like secrets.

144
00:08:34.490 --> 00:08:37.730
And the reality is that all of us have been kept in the dark on the prior

145
00:08:37.731 --> 00:08:39.890
excavations into the great Sphinx.

146
00:08:40.280 --> 00:08:44.180
And regardless if you are a proponent of the academic narrative and alternative

147
00:08:44.181 --> 00:08:45.500
ancient history enthusiasts,

148
00:08:45.530 --> 00:08:49.760
a history professor and archeologist or believer in ancient aliens,

149
00:08:49.790 --> 00:08:54.410
the one thing that we all have in common is that we can now see that all of us

150
00:08:54.411 --> 00:08:58.170
have not shown everything that there is to see or be aware of.

151
00:08:58.560 --> 00:09:00.810
Even if this tunnel goes absolutely nowhere,

152
00:09:00.850 --> 00:09:02.550
nothing was ever found inside of it.

153
00:09:02.640 --> 00:09:06.480
We can't necessarily take that in good faith since we haven't been included in

154
00:09:06.481 --> 00:09:09.480
all the details along the way, because let's not forget.

155
00:09:10.350 --> 00:09:14.280
<v 3>And so three weeks I spent down in the darkness</v>

156
00:09:15.000 --> 00:09:16.710
underneath the great Sphinx.

157
00:09:21.150 --> 00:09:22.680
<v 2>We so should every word,</v>

158
00:09:23.610 --> 00:09:26.580
but there is nothing hidden underneath.

159
00:09:29.700 --> 00:09:34.530
<v 0>A whole three weeks, which was done in secrecy with a literal shroud concealing,</v>

160
00:09:34.531 --> 00:09:37.020
the excavation the entire time,

161
00:09:37.380 --> 00:09:40.860
all of us owe a great bit of gratitude to the brave gentlemen that took the risk

162
00:09:40.861 --> 00:09:42.390
to climb down into the Sphinx.

163
00:09:42.660 --> 00:09:45.930
So we were able to see what we were today and become aware of the details that

164
00:09:45.931 --> 00:09:48.030
we now know. And, you know, it's interesting,

165
00:09:48.180 --> 00:09:52.800
I've been long making the case that there truly is a mystery to our lost ancient

166
00:09:52.801 --> 00:09:56.430
past something that many people have adamantly denied.

167
00:09:56.670 --> 00:10:00.570
But how can anyone say that any longer when it's now apparent that there are

168
00:10:00.571 --> 00:10:05.220
quite literally areas they have never knew existed and of all places at one of

169
00:10:05.221 --> 00:10:08.040
the most famous ancient sites on earth.

170
00:10:08.430 --> 00:10:11.730
And do you know what else these are not the only secrets that's been kept from

171
00:10:11.731 --> 00:10:15.990
the public involving ancient Egypt? I do have more to share. However,

172
00:10:16.290 --> 00:10:20.550
those are worthy of videos of themselves. So stay tuned for that.

173
00:10:20.730 --> 00:10:24.540
But all of that said the powers that be within Egypt shall release all photos

174
00:10:24.541 --> 00:10:28.170
and videos of what's inside these tunnels. Because if nothing else,

175
00:10:28.171 --> 00:10:29.490
even if there's nothing to see,

176
00:10:29.730 --> 00:10:34.650
it will still bring positive light and in something fun and exciting to look at

177
00:10:34.950 --> 00:10:38.640
to the tourism industry within Egypt itself and to the millions and millions of

178
00:10:38.641 --> 00:10:43.170
people that follow this fun topic from around the world that said, I'm Jimmy,
