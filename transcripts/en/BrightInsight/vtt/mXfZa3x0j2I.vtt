00:00:00.980 --> 00:00:05.720
<v 0>The ancient Egyptians are far more mysterious than most people realize as they</v>

2
00:00:05.721 --> 00:00:10.640
left us with literally zero explanation of any kind as to how they cut and

3
00:00:10.641 --> 00:00:14.640
carved the tens of millions of stone blocks to make up the pyramids and the

4
00:00:14.641 --> 00:00:16.120
countless thousands of solid stone,

5
00:00:16.270 --> 00:00:18.720
statues and OSS that have been found throughout Egypt.

6
00:00:19.100 --> 00:00:23.270
The reality is that all we have today are theories and guesswork as to what

7
00:00:23.271 --> 00:00:27.110
methods they may have utilized to cut and carve these millions of stones,

8
00:00:27.340 --> 00:00:31.830
including bronze saws and chisels and stone hammers.

9
00:00:32.290 --> 00:00:35.590
And what you're about to see is an incredible clip that I took just last month

10
00:00:35.800 --> 00:00:38.510
while visiting the Swan Qury in Egypt,

11
00:00:38.880 --> 00:00:43.820
which is the location in sight of the world's largest solid stone Oly,

12
00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:46.460
commonly referred to as the unfinished Oly.

13
00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:51.460
And we had the opportunity to physically demonstrate this method,

14
00:00:51.470 --> 00:00:52.580
which is again,

15
00:00:53.300 --> 00:00:57.500
a primary among the primary methods that have been considered to be with ancient

16
00:00:57.530 --> 00:01:01.970
Egyptians use. Even though, again, the Egyptians never told us stat.

17
00:01:02.490 --> 00:01:04.770
So modern researchers went in there and started,

18
00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:07.130
they saw these stone hammers and they're like,

19
00:01:07.131 --> 00:01:08.690
that must be what they have used to do it,

20
00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:14.170
but apparently these dorks never tried it themselves. And Hey, I'm a dork,

21
00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:17.930
no disrespect, but it's not until you actually see what this,

22
00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:20.890
these methods with your own eyes that you see,

23
00:01:20.891 --> 00:01:24.720
just how honestly silly these methods are.

24
00:01:25.220 --> 00:01:29.360
So look at this clip, think for yourself and let me know what you think.

25
00:01:29.630 --> 00:01:30.920
Here we go. Hold.

26
00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:33.760
<v 1>On. All right, dolo right. Stone hammers. This is how they say they did it.</v>

27
00:01:33.761 --> 00:01:34.840
Let's see what it does on Rose Grant.

28
00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:41.240
Maybe if I pour some water on it, does that hurt your hands? How hard is that?

29
00:01:41.920 --> 00:01:45.950
Uh, I kind of doesn't really hurt yet. It's not doing anything.

30
00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:50.510
Try doing a little grinding dust. Oh, this is a good shot.

31
00:01:51.070 --> 00:01:53.950
You just chopping up dust. Now he is getting stuff off the edge.

32
00:01:54.020 --> 00:01:58.110
This is what we need a whole team. Give these men some beer,

33
00:01:59.150 --> 00:02:03.860
awful. A few hours. Oh my God. I mean,

34
00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:06.100
there are, they are getting into it, but man, that was,

35
00:02:06.680 --> 00:02:09.500
are you ATIC yet starting to sucking to suck.

36
00:02:09.780 --> 00:02:12.300
Cause it's really starting to suck. It hurts mark. You probably,

37
00:02:13.380 --> 00:02:14.620
I think they were wearing goggles.

38
00:02:14.890 --> 00:02:19.340
This is literally the ministry explanation for how this entire

39
00:02:19.940 --> 00:02:24.930
quarry I was accomplished, including this 1200 ton,

40
00:02:25.510 --> 00:02:28.450
140 foot long Oly.

41
00:02:30.800 --> 00:02:34.850
Literally that is the explanation, which doesn't make sense.

42
00:02:34.851 --> 00:02:36.850
Especially when you look at all the scoop marks,

43
00:02:37.900 --> 00:02:40.050
which looks more indicative and I'm not suggesting,

44
00:02:40.051 --> 00:02:42.290
but looks more indicative of, uh, sandblasting.

45
00:02:42.291 --> 00:02:45.080
I've heard other people stone Mason say that. Um,

46
00:02:45.860 --> 00:02:50.040
but how they did it is a mystery it's yet to be demonstrated

47
00:02:50.980 --> 00:02:55.240
for people using these do right stone hammers to do something like this,

48
00:02:55.241 --> 00:03:00.160
especially with the nature of the corners and the scoop marks underneath and

49
00:03:00.161 --> 00:03:03.840
throughout. It's just silly. Honestly, it is a silly explanation.

50
00:03:05.260 --> 00:03:08.880
I'm not suggesting they had power tools. I don't know how they did it.

51
00:03:09.300 --> 00:03:14.080
But what I do know is that the so-called mainstream explanation is

52
00:03:14.880 --> 00:03:16.280
debunked. As far as I'm concerned,

53
00:03:16.281 --> 00:03:19.950
when it comes to these stone hammers and just look how small people are compared

54
00:03:19.951 --> 00:03:24.510
to this thing, I'm gonna still hear him doing that.

55
00:03:24.511 --> 00:03:28.870
What do you think Ben clearly, clearly stone pound is involved in this.

56
00:03:28.970 --> 00:03:31.870
We were wrong. Let's just get over it. Just get a few guys around it.

57
00:03:31.871 --> 00:03:34.430
There's plenty of room for like enough guys to lift this up. Right. And,

58
00:03:34.630 --> 00:03:38.910
and oh yeah. Once they're done. Yeah. It's easy. Lift it up. Ropes and pullies.

59
00:03:40.080 --> 00:03:44.820
Get over it. Let's get a few guys, everyone together now. And meanwhile,

60
00:03:44.821 --> 00:03:48.540
they're still chopping up dust over there. They all got arthritis.

61
00:03:48.720 --> 00:03:51.660
You guys will feel that for the rest of your lives. &lt;laugh&gt;

62
00:03:53.770 --> 00:03:58.540
well done. So this is how they claim they did it a do right. Stone hammer.

63
00:03:59.460 --> 00:04:02.090
This is rose granite. Let me get a feel for it.

64
00:04:05.080 --> 00:04:10.050
Yeah, it doesn't feel good on your hands. One, one bit. Look at that.

65
00:04:10.110 --> 00:04:13.450
I'm doing nothing more than kicking up dust. You know,

66
00:04:13.451 --> 00:04:14.770
I'm seeing just grinding it away a little bit.

67
00:04:15.560 --> 00:04:20.320
That is the mainstream explanation for how this whole quarry was core read.

68
00:04:25.360 --> 00:04:28.880
Yeah, no, I'm sorry. I'm not claiming to know how they did it,

69
00:04:30.500 --> 00:04:35.040
but to suggest that this whole quarry, including this 12,

70
00:04:35.360 --> 00:04:39.640
some 1200 ton unfinished Oly, which is approximately 140 feet long.

71
00:04:40.830 --> 00:04:43.870
Look at this thing. It's deep. I got pictures of me down in there.

72
00:04:44.300 --> 00:04:47.230
It's very tall. When you're standing at the base of the, uh,

73
00:04:47.810 --> 00:04:52.750
of it inside the trench, it is probably nine or so feet high,

74
00:04:52.751 --> 00:04:56.310
just a, just a guess higher than my hand can reach. And I'm five foot 10.

75
00:04:59.140 --> 00:05:03.340
Yeah. That is death. Not how they did it. That's just silly.

76
00:05:04.970 --> 00:05:09.540
<v 0>Yeah. No, that's, that's definitely not how they did that clearly. And,</v>

77
00:05:09.740 --> 00:05:12.340
and do you wanna hear one of the most interesting things about that?

78
00:05:12.560 --> 00:05:17.420
So that stone that you saw is pounding on is the same exact stone that has

79
00:05:17.421 --> 00:05:19.740
been pounded on for more than 20 plus years,

80
00:05:20.520 --> 00:05:25.330
by count out list tens of thousands or even hundreds of thousands of tourists

81
00:05:26.070 --> 00:05:30.250
and the things barely dented. Clearly that's not the method. And by the way,

82
00:05:30.480 --> 00:05:34.010
what are those scoop marks about that doesn't look like? I mean,

83
00:05:34.030 --> 00:05:36.010
how there's so many of 'em and they're all just, no,

84
00:05:36.011 --> 00:05:38.930
that's not from lining up a bunch of people and pounding away with a stone

85
00:05:39.130 --> 00:05:42.010
hammer. And another big question is how are,

86
00:05:42.280 --> 00:05:45.880
were they gonna lift and move that OS out of that trench once they're done with

87
00:05:45.881 --> 00:05:48.480
it, as you heard Ben from the awesome YouTube channel on chart X,

88
00:05:48.481 --> 00:05:49.960
bring up in that video clip.

89
00:05:50.760 --> 00:05:55.440
I mean the OS and Curry is the same exact Qury where the experts say

90
00:05:55.590 --> 00:05:56.480
that the stones,

91
00:05:56.481 --> 00:06:00.440
the granite stones were brought from to make up the pyramids and other places in

92
00:06:00.550 --> 00:06:03.560
Giza 500 plus miles away from Giza is Osan.

93
00:06:04.230 --> 00:06:07.840
Nothing out Osan is a quarry. Nothing else is there. There's no statues.

94
00:06:07.841 --> 00:06:11.400
It's not some ceremonial place. So they were gonna clearly have to lift it,

95
00:06:11.401 --> 00:06:12.840
take it out and bring it somewhere else.

96
00:06:13.140 --> 00:06:15.160
And the reason why they didn't and which by the way,

97
00:06:15.161 --> 00:06:16.870
that would raise so many questions and it's like,

98
00:06:16.871 --> 00:06:17.710
come on how they gonna do that?

99
00:06:18.630 --> 00:06:20.950
But the reason they didn't is cuz the thing has a crack in it and you can look

100
00:06:20.951 --> 00:06:23.910
back and see that it's there. And that's the reason why they apparently,

101
00:06:24.030 --> 00:06:25.230
or it's believed why they had abandon it.

102
00:06:25.650 --> 00:06:29.830
But not only that guys look underneath the thing and look at those unique scoot

103
00:06:29.831 --> 00:06:30.111
marks,

104
00:06:30.111 --> 00:06:33.390
how are you gonna get in there with those stone hammers and bang away at that?

105
00:06:33.660 --> 00:06:37.780
It's not feasible. It holds absolutely no water. And as you saw in the video,

106
00:06:38.940 --> 00:06:42.260
it's been debunked. So this in itself should be raising questions,

107
00:06:42.600 --> 00:06:46.860
new questions as to exploring how the ancients were able to accomplish these

108
00:06:46.861 --> 00:06:51.420
amazing feats. So anyways guys, I'm gonna close it up there,

109
00:06:51.421 --> 00:06:55.220
but I wanna give a quick shout out to the new up and coming channel, uh,

110
00:06:55.221 --> 00:06:59.010
among the ancient history community, which is, is Johanna James guys.

111
00:06:59.150 --> 00:07:02.770
We finally have a female in the mix and it's been long overdue.

112
00:07:03.190 --> 00:07:04.650
She came with Ben and I on the tour.

113
00:07:04.740 --> 00:07:07.850
She's an actress and comedian and screenplay writer in London.

114
00:07:08.510 --> 00:07:11.850
Go check out her videos. They're outstanding, the generating buzz already.

115
00:07:11.910 --> 00:07:12.930
And they're so well done.

116
00:07:13.110 --> 00:07:17.210
And she provides a very unique perspective about all of this ancient past stuff.

117
00:07:17.230 --> 00:07:20.120
But anyway, with all that said, I'm Jimmy,

118
00:07:20.140 --> 00:07:23.320
my channel's called bright insight and I have many more videos for you to come

119
00:07:23.780 --> 00:07:26.920
in a very short period of time. I've been guys, I've been moving.

120
00:07:26.990 --> 00:07:29.720
I've been busy with all kinds of stuff. If you, if you're not familiar, go,

121
00:07:29.880 --> 00:07:32.080
go to my Instagram cuz I'm sharing a lot more stuff on there.

122
00:07:32.800 --> 00:07:35.320
So if you've been wondering why I've been sharing these other videos from my

123
00:07:35.340 --> 00:07:39.910
iPhone guys, those videos, we're not supposed to ever go on to YouTube.

124
00:07:39.950 --> 00:07:43.190
I was gonna put them on Instagram or just have 'em as Jimmy's home videos.

125
00:07:43.850 --> 00:07:47.870
My way of making videos is with these presentations where I talk and I show

126
00:07:48.090 --> 00:07:52.430
slides and photos and I took tens of thousands more than 20,000 photos on this

127
00:07:52.431 --> 00:07:56.590
trip. So I have like enough content for dozens and dozens of videos to come.

128
00:07:57.210 --> 00:07:58.990
So some people were like, why did you film Inver?

129
00:07:59.740 --> 00:08:03.100
Cause I didn't think I was putting on the internet &lt;laugh&gt; anyways guys. So, uh,

130
00:08:03.101 --> 00:08:05.420
look forward to new videos to come real soon. I'm uh,

131
00:08:05.421 --> 00:08:08.540
back in Arizona now I moved here from Boise, Idaho. Uh,

132
00:08:08.541 --> 00:08:10.740
this is where I'm originally from. So I'm real excited about that.

133
00:08:10.741 --> 00:08:14.140
So now that I'm settled in, I finally have time to be making more video content.

134
00:08:14.280 --> 00:08:16.780
So all that said, leave a comment,

135
00:08:16.920 --> 00:08:19.380
let me know what your thoughts are and all of this and I'll see you all again

136
00:08:19.381 --> 00:08:20.730
real soon. Bye now.
