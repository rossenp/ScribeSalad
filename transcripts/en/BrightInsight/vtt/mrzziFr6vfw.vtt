00:00:00.660 --> 00:00:05.100
<v 0>The true history of ancient Egypt is far older than what we were taught in</v>

2
00:00:05.101 --> 00:00:07.050
school. And in this video,

3
00:00:07.080 --> 00:00:10.530
I'm going to give you three examples that will make you rethink virtually

4
00:00:10.531 --> 00:00:15.180
everything you thought you knew about the age of the ancient Egyptians. You see,

5
00:00:15.210 --> 00:00:16.980
according to our textbooks,

6
00:00:17.010 --> 00:00:21.690
the great pyramid of Giza Egypt was constructed roughly 4,500 years

7
00:00:21.691 --> 00:00:25.680
ago, or in the year 2,500 BC. But let's be clear.

8
00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:28.290
They do not know that with absolute certainty,

9
00:00:28.291 --> 00:00:32.430
as there are far too many unanswered questions and mysteries about the ancient

10
00:00:32.431 --> 00:00:33.264
Egyptians.

11
00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:37.950
<v 1>This is why you'll see words like suggests when modern historians</v>

12
00:00:38.480 --> 00:00:40.500
discussed the purported age of the great pyramid,

13
00:00:40.501 --> 00:00:45.330
because they ultimately do not have definitive proof of when it was constructed,

14
00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:49.620
much less. How so make no mistake. It truly is a mystery.

15
00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:54.120
And this is where things start to get weird because there is new evidence that

16
00:00:54.121 --> 00:00:58.920
has come to light in modern times that strongly suggests that the

17
00:00:58.921 --> 00:01:03.810
world's oldest largest and most mysterious structures ever made is

18
00:01:03.811 --> 00:01:06.960
actually thousands of years older than what we were taught.

19
00:01:07.410 --> 00:01:11.760
<v 0>Let me first share with you an ancient artifact that very few people are aware</v>

20
00:01:11.761 --> 00:01:15.300
of, which is commonly referred to as the newbie and egg,

21
00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:20.250
which was discovered in a 7,000 year old tomb in the Nubian desert of

22
00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:21.270
sedan.

23
00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:25.590
And I was completely unaware of this incredible artifact until I visited the

24
00:01:25.591 --> 00:01:30.480
Nubian museum in Asan Egypt. Well, I toured ancient Egypt sites late last year.

25
00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:34.980
What you're looking at here is a decorated Oster JAG, which like I said,

26
00:01:34.981 --> 00:01:39.210
was discovered in a tomb that was carbon dated to 7,000 years ago.

27
00:01:39.930 --> 00:01:42.690
And what do you see on this egg? Well,

28
00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:46.080
if you ask me that is the depiction of three pyramids,

29
00:01:46.110 --> 00:01:48.030
but let me be clear upfront.

30
00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:52.290
The so-called experts have said that they couldn't possibly be pyramid since

31
00:01:52.291 --> 00:01:57.000
this Relic is 2,500 years older than the great pyramid of Giza.

32
00:01:57.001 --> 00:02:00.420
So of course it couldn't possibly be depicting pyramids.

33
00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:04.830
Thus they've claimed this must be just a depiction of mountains.

34
00:02:05.130 --> 00:02:08.160
End of story. Nothing to see here,

35
00:02:08.161 --> 00:02:10.770
but when you take a closer look,

36
00:02:11.100 --> 00:02:14.400
what on earth are those lines supposed to be? I mean,

37
00:02:14.760 --> 00:02:18.870
nevermind that this drawing would be illustrating some pretty bizarre shaped

38
00:02:18.871 --> 00:02:21.720
mountains. Like I've never seen before. I mean, come on.

39
00:02:21.990 --> 00:02:26.400
This was found in the new Bian desert of Sudan, which mountains exactly are,

40
00:02:26.430 --> 00:02:28.800
is this supposed to be portraying? I mean,

41
00:02:29.160 --> 00:02:32.130
if they are going to adamantly claim that these are just mountains,

42
00:02:32.160 --> 00:02:35.910
then which mountains specifically are they suggesting it's supposed to be?

43
00:02:36.210 --> 00:02:39.990
I took it upon myself to look up the various mountain chains that are located in

44
00:02:39.991 --> 00:02:43.860
sedan. And I have to say that I found nothing of the sort, I mean,

45
00:02:43.950 --> 00:02:47.670
is this supposed to be of the 9,800 foot to Reba caldera?

46
00:02:47.671 --> 00:02:52.320
Which obviously looks nothing like it or perhaps the teal mountains in

47
00:02:52.350 --> 00:02:55.050
Eastern Sudan? Um, no.

48
00:02:55.470 --> 00:02:57.570
Or what about the El taco mountains?

49
00:02:57.780 --> 00:03:01.540
I have to say that that's obviously best choice when compared to the others,

50
00:03:01.570 --> 00:03:06.220
but that would have to be a rather terrible pictorial example of them on this

51
00:03:06.221 --> 00:03:09.070
egg. I mean, just compare the two of them together.

52
00:03:09.490 --> 00:03:12.910
And I'd say that it's simply not a match considering how sharply shaped this

53
00:03:12.911 --> 00:03:17.020
depiction is. And I'm just not seeing a connection here. And to be fair,

54
00:03:17.050 --> 00:03:20.950
nobody that's claimed that this pictorial images of mountains has actually

55
00:03:20.951 --> 00:03:23.860
claimed that they are of the all Taka mountains. Like I said,

56
00:03:23.861 --> 00:03:27.910
I simply took it upon myself to research various mountains located in sedan to

57
00:03:27.911 --> 00:03:30.580
see if there was any type of connection. And with that said,

58
00:03:30.581 --> 00:03:34.750
I have to say that the newbie and pyramids located in Sudan seemed to resemble

59
00:03:34.751 --> 00:03:38.350
the angle of the drawings based on the unique steepness compared to other

60
00:03:38.351 --> 00:03:41.980
pyramids, such as the ones we find in Giza. However,

61
00:03:42.040 --> 00:03:46.750
these pyramids were constructed some 2000 years after the pyramids of

62
00:03:46.751 --> 00:03:51.160
Giza and approximately 5,000 years after the Nubian egg

63
00:03:51.161 --> 00:03:54.460
itself. But most importantly, and getting back to the point,

64
00:03:54.461 --> 00:03:58.060
I made a moment ago about the lines on the depiction. Let's be real.

65
00:03:58.330 --> 00:04:02.080
This is exactly what pyramids are. They consist of layers of steps,

66
00:04:02.260 --> 00:04:04.420
which results in the pyramid itself.

67
00:04:04.421 --> 00:04:08.530
So I have to say that this in itself rules out that they are mountains.

68
00:04:08.830 --> 00:04:12.640
I like to think for myself, and this just is not what mountains look like,

69
00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:16.060
which is exactly what the experts claim them to be.

70
00:04:16.061 --> 00:04:20.770
And they do not allege them to be of the newbie and pyramids either. But again,

71
00:04:20.980 --> 00:04:24.940
of some unspecified mountains and there just so happens to be three of them,

72
00:04:25.510 --> 00:04:29.230
which is what we happened to find on the Giza plateau relatively,

73
00:04:29.231 --> 00:04:31.240
not far away up the Nile river,

74
00:04:31.690 --> 00:04:35.920
the same place where modern researchers have already suggested that the pyramids

75
00:04:35.921 --> 00:04:40.360
of Giza are much, much older than what we thought possible, but of course,

76
00:04:40.390 --> 00:04:41.620
nothing here is certain.

77
00:04:41.620 --> 00:04:45.250
And this depiction certainly does not prove that the great pyramid is more than

78
00:04:45.251 --> 00:04:49.930
7,000 years old. However, it is certainly worthy of discussion and debate.

79
00:04:50.050 --> 00:04:50.980
Nevertheless,

80
00:04:51.010 --> 00:04:55.060
there is more to this egg than just those pyramid mountains or whatever you want

81
00:04:55.061 --> 00:04:58.780
to call them. Notice the zigzag shape to the right of it.

82
00:04:58.840 --> 00:05:00.880
Could this be the Nile river? I mean,

83
00:05:01.120 --> 00:05:04.990
it's not hard to suggest it when you consider the fact that the Nile does indeed

84
00:05:05.500 --> 00:05:08.860
zigzag for thousands of mountains all the way down to the Nubian desert of

85
00:05:08.861 --> 00:05:12.340
Sudan. And not only that, it happens to be the,

86
00:05:12.341 --> 00:05:16.540
on the right or that say the Eastern side of the potentially annotated pyramids,

87
00:05:16.960 --> 00:05:21.010
which is exactly the case of what we find in Cairo with the Nile river being

88
00:05:21.040 --> 00:05:24.040
east of the Giza plateau. But that's not all,

89
00:05:24.041 --> 00:05:28.000
this is just one side of the egg. When we go to the other side,

90
00:05:28.030 --> 00:05:31.900
we get another depiction of the same pyramid shaped formation. However,

91
00:05:32.230 --> 00:05:36.940
with this different unique formation to the right of it could this once again,

92
00:05:36.941 --> 00:05:41.470
be depicting the Nile river because when you consider the area of the Nile known

93
00:05:41.471 --> 00:05:44.650
as the [inaudible] Oasis, which is south and west of Cairo,

94
00:05:45.100 --> 00:05:47.530
and which today resembles the shape of a heart,

95
00:05:48.280 --> 00:05:53.230
consider how this shape on the egg stems sharp to the left, or that say west,

96
00:05:53.320 --> 00:05:57.290
and is now below, or let's say south of the possible pyramid depiction.

97
00:05:57.980 --> 00:06:02.930
This is very similar to what we see in Egypt. The film Oasis, like I said,

98
00:06:02.931 --> 00:06:06.080
is south of Giza and extends to the west. Now,

99
00:06:06.470 --> 00:06:08.810
here is one point that must be mentioned,

100
00:06:08.811 --> 00:06:13.370
which is that the path and shape of the Nile river today is not the same as it

101
00:06:13.371 --> 00:06:14.720
was thousands of years ago.

102
00:06:15.140 --> 00:06:19.520
The river has moved past many times over the last several thousand years as this

103
00:06:19.521 --> 00:06:22.100
has been something that's been studied since extensively.

104
00:06:22.100 --> 00:06:25.580
So we should not assume that the depictions on this egg,

105
00:06:25.820 --> 00:06:30.620
assuming that it is of the Nile would be exactly the same as it were when it was

106
00:06:30.621 --> 00:06:32.480
drawn some 7,000 years ago.

107
00:06:32.481 --> 00:06:37.430
And of course these are indeed rudimentary drawings onto an OSR JAG.

108
00:06:37.431 --> 00:06:41.090
So it's not like it would be perfect or much less drawn to scale either.

109
00:06:41.120 --> 00:06:45.980
But come on the two drawings of the so-called mountains on this egg have

110
00:06:45.981 --> 00:06:49.490
lines that go right through them. So I'm just going to say it.

111
00:06:49.700 --> 00:06:51.740
I think that this is annotating pyramids. I mean,

112
00:06:51.741 --> 00:06:56.570
I've already been highly suspicious that the great pyramid and the pyramids of

113
00:06:56.600 --> 00:06:59.930
Giza, as well as certain other sites around Egypt are much,

114
00:06:59.960 --> 00:07:02.210
much older than what they are alleged to be.

115
00:07:02.300 --> 00:07:04.400
But when it comes to sciencing things out,

116
00:07:04.401 --> 00:07:06.590
I'll save my suspicions for another video,

117
00:07:06.710 --> 00:07:11.240
because there is another fascinating aspect of this egg that really makes me

118
00:07:11.241 --> 00:07:13.220
wonder. And my friend, Johanna James,

119
00:07:13.221 --> 00:07:17.000
who was traveling with me in Egypt last year, made a great video discussing it,

120
00:07:17.001 --> 00:07:19.610
which real quick, go check out her channel. You'll love it.

121
00:07:19.611 --> 00:07:24.230
But look at the top here of this egg, these circular rings.

122
00:07:25.220 --> 00:07:27.830
Hmm. Where on earth have we seen that before?

123
00:07:28.550 --> 00:07:32.690
The lost city of Atlantis was said to consist of three rings of water and two of

124
00:07:32.691 --> 00:07:33.111
land.

125
00:07:33.111 --> 00:07:37.010
And let's not forget that the legend of the lost city of Atlantis originates

126
00:07:37.011 --> 00:07:38.750
from the ancient Egyptians themselves.

127
00:07:39.050 --> 00:07:41.870
That's a fact that most people are not aware of as the ancient Greek

128
00:07:41.871 --> 00:07:44.120
philosopher, Plato gets all the credit,

129
00:07:44.150 --> 00:07:48.920
but Egypt is where the legend of a lost circular city consisting of

130
00:07:48.921 --> 00:07:53.660
three rings of water and to have land comes from. So when you look at this here,

131
00:07:54.110 --> 00:07:56.750
tell me that's not what we're seeing or at least possibly. I mean,

132
00:07:56.751 --> 00:07:58.310
I really wish I had better photos,

133
00:07:58.311 --> 00:08:00.470
but the great news is that I'll be back in Egypt,

134
00:08:00.500 --> 00:08:05.120
this October with Brian Forester. And I will be sure to get high definition,

135
00:08:05.121 --> 00:08:09.710
pictures and videos of this egg this time around. But I don't know,

136
00:08:09.711 --> 00:08:13.850
guys, I think there's something here, here, and whoever the person was,

137
00:08:13.910 --> 00:08:17.960
it was buried with this egg was perhaps trying to tell a story of this person's

138
00:08:18.020 --> 00:08:19.580
various travels through life,

139
00:08:20.030 --> 00:08:23.930
or possibly even pass down and spread the tale of the steroid ancient city of

140
00:08:23.931 --> 00:08:26.600
Atlantis, which the Egyptians were said to have came from.

141
00:08:26.780 --> 00:08:29.360
This is something I will discuss more in another video,

142
00:08:29.361 --> 00:08:31.370
but going to back to my main point,

143
00:08:31.400 --> 00:08:34.520
which is that Egypt was much older than what we were taught.

144
00:08:35.030 --> 00:08:38.120
Let me bring you to the second point of this video,

145
00:08:38.390 --> 00:08:42.260
which is another profound discovery that came about late last year.

146
00:08:42.290 --> 00:08:44.630
At the same time that I happened to be traveling through Egypt.

147
00:08:44.960 --> 00:08:48.740
What you're seeing here are pieces of ancient Cedar wood that have been

148
00:08:48.741 --> 00:08:52.640
preserved after being removed from the great pyramid back in 1872,

149
00:08:52.910 --> 00:08:54.830
it was then taken to a museum in Britain,

150
00:08:54.860 --> 00:08:57.690
but it went missing for more than a century,

151
00:08:57.691 --> 00:08:59.640
not long after arriving at the museum.

152
00:08:59.940 --> 00:09:03.540
And it turns out that was due to a filing error and it sat in the museums

153
00:09:03.541 --> 00:09:07.590
archives for well over a hundred years. But in late 2020,

154
00:09:07.680 --> 00:09:11.280
it was rediscovered within the museums archives. And when it was carbon dated,

155
00:09:11.700 --> 00:09:14.390
researchers were blown away at the findings.

156
00:09:14.391 --> 00:09:16.710
So get this at a minimum.

157
00:09:16.950 --> 00:09:21.480
This would dates back at least 514 years older

158
00:09:21.810 --> 00:09:24.960
than the suggested date for the great pyramids construction.

159
00:09:25.500 --> 00:09:29.550
And that was the headline that made rounds around the world that a piece of wood

160
00:09:29.551 --> 00:09:34.260
that is 500 years older than the pyramid in which it was found inside of.

161
00:09:34.440 --> 00:09:35.273
However,

162
00:09:35.400 --> 00:09:39.450
there was a range of dating for the wood that most articles did not mention,

163
00:09:39.480 --> 00:09:44.340
which is that it could be as much as 781 years older

164
00:09:44.580 --> 00:09:49.470
than the suggested construction date of the great pyramid. That's 267 years,

165
00:09:49.471 --> 00:09:52.410
more than 514 years. So in other words,

166
00:09:52.411 --> 00:09:56.760
nearly 800 years older than the purported age of the great pyramid.

167
00:09:57.210 --> 00:10:00.930
I mean, that's closer to a thousand years older than the pyramids, and yes,

168
00:10:00.931 --> 00:10:04.290
I shouldn't get carried away with rounding up, but that's substantial.

169
00:10:04.440 --> 00:10:05.310
But that aside,

170
00:10:05.311 --> 00:10:09.060
what are the possible explanations for a 5,000 year old piece of wood being

171
00:10:09.061 --> 00:10:12.480
found in a 4,500 year old pyramid? Well,

172
00:10:12.510 --> 00:10:15.450
the experts came up with three different possible explanations,

173
00:10:15.451 --> 00:10:17.670
but I have to say that of the three of them,

174
00:10:17.970 --> 00:10:21.360
two of them are unbelievably weak excuses. For example,

175
00:10:21.810 --> 00:10:25.980
one suggested possibility is that the wood was already 500 years old when it was

176
00:10:25.981 --> 00:10:29.850
used for the construction of the pyramid because trees were rare in the deserts

177
00:10:29.851 --> 00:10:33.900
of Egypt. So it would have been recycled, but you know, I'm sorry,

178
00:10:34.050 --> 00:10:36.540
that has to be one of the laziest possibilities out there. I mean,

179
00:10:36.541 --> 00:10:40.110
I just don't buy it because to suggest that a piece of wood would be

180
00:10:40.111 --> 00:10:45.030
continuously recycled for five centuries, sounds less than feasible,

181
00:10:45.031 --> 00:10:48.720
especially when you consider that it would be used to construct something as

182
00:10:49.050 --> 00:10:52.590
enormously heavy and massive as a fricking pyramid. I mean, come on,

183
00:10:52.591 --> 00:10:53.424
give me a break.

184
00:10:53.730 --> 00:10:58.230
But another possibility was at the 500 year old wood was intentionally used

185
00:10:58.231 --> 00:11:02.910
because of its age in order to honor the Pharaoh and the extensive age and

186
00:11:02.911 --> 00:11:07.890
history of Egypt. Now, nah, I'm not buying that either. I mean,

187
00:11:07.891 --> 00:11:10.950
really? I ain't come on. Hey, look, here's some really old wood.

188
00:11:10.951 --> 00:11:14.520
That's just throw this all in, in here in the pyramid and onto the fare over,

189
00:11:14.550 --> 00:11:17.670
give it an artistic edge based on its age. I mean, come on please.

190
00:11:18.270 --> 00:11:22.410
But let me say this the best and most probable possibility given was that the

191
00:11:22.411 --> 00:11:25.680
Cedar tree itself may have already been hundreds of years old when it was cut

192
00:11:25.681 --> 00:11:27.960
down and used for the pyramids construction.

193
00:11:27.961 --> 00:11:31.860
And when we consider that Cedars can live up to a thousand years and age,

194
00:11:32.480 --> 00:11:33.660
that's certainly is a possibility.

195
00:11:34.080 --> 00:11:37.680
I feel like more scientific testing needs to be done on this wood to establish

196
00:11:37.710 --> 00:11:40.890
various possibilities of its age and where it may have originated from.

197
00:11:40.950 --> 00:11:42.060
But when we think of an Oster,

198
00:11:42.450 --> 00:11:46.110
Jake being with pyramids drawn on it being placed inside of a 7,000 year old

199
00:11:46.111 --> 00:11:46.944
tomb,

200
00:11:47.070 --> 00:11:51.540
it makes me think that the Cedar wood itself was placed inside the pyramid far

201
00:11:51.541 --> 00:11:53.770
earlier than 4,500 years ago.

202
00:11:54.130 --> 00:11:58.240
Now the third point of this video to build the case at the true age of the

203
00:11:58.241 --> 00:12:00.940
ancient Egyptians is thousands of years older than we thought.

204
00:12:01.470 --> 00:12:04.540
It brings me back to a point that I've mentioned in many prior videos,

205
00:12:04.541 --> 00:12:07.180
but it must be repeated as much as possible.

206
00:12:07.420 --> 00:12:11.950
So far more people can become aware of it as it is unbelievably significant

207
00:12:11.980 --> 00:12:16.330
scientific evidence that is ultimately undeniable to anyone that's actually done

208
00:12:16.331 --> 00:12:19.930
the research, which is the remarkable amount of rain,

209
00:12:19.931 --> 00:12:24.700
water erosion around the enclosure of the great Springs of Giza to make a long

210
00:12:24.701 --> 00:12:25.534
story short.

211
00:12:25.660 --> 00:12:30.370
We all know that Egypt is one dry place and the last time it had any significant

212
00:12:30.371 --> 00:12:33.310
rainfall was nearly 9,000 years ago.

213
00:12:33.311 --> 00:12:37.960
Yet there appears to be many thousands of years of water erosion around the

214
00:12:37.961 --> 00:12:41.050
limestone bedrock of its enclosure that it was carved out of.

215
00:12:41.650 --> 00:12:45.520
This becomes even more interesting when we consider that the Sphinx itself was

216
00:12:45.521 --> 00:12:49.060
known to have been consumed with sand for thousands of years.

217
00:12:49.061 --> 00:12:53.590
So the question becomes when did the rain water erosion happen?

218
00:12:53.890 --> 00:12:57.700
And when the so-called experts have claimed that the Sphinx is most likely

219
00:12:57.730 --> 00:13:01.090
around 4,200 years old, and by the way,

220
00:13:01.150 --> 00:13:05.020
they say that without any real proof, nowhere in Egypt,

221
00:13:05.140 --> 00:13:09.670
will you find any depictions or any type of documents of the Sphinx or when,

222
00:13:09.671 --> 00:13:11.440
or how it was constructed,

223
00:13:11.920 --> 00:13:16.000
nor do we even know for sure who the person whose face was re carved into it,

224
00:13:16.330 --> 00:13:19.480
there are theories, but nothing is certain. Think about that.

225
00:13:20.020 --> 00:13:21.340
You see the science,

226
00:13:21.341 --> 00:13:25.840
which is something we hear about all the time nowadays tells us that the Sphinx

227
00:13:25.870 --> 00:13:30.730
is significantly older by many thousands of years. The water erosion is there.

228
00:13:30.910 --> 00:13:34.630
Geologists have extensively studied it and concluded that the erosion is so

229
00:13:34.631 --> 00:13:35.464
significant.

230
00:13:35.830 --> 00:13:39.400
They would have had to have taken many thousands of years to reach this point.

231
00:13:39.401 --> 00:13:40.234
And again,

232
00:13:40.330 --> 00:13:43.780
this is despite the fact that the Spinks was buried in sand for the last

233
00:13:44.290 --> 00:13:45.820
thousand, a couple thousand years already.

234
00:13:46.600 --> 00:13:49.570
This becomes even more interesting when you consider all of the recent

235
00:13:49.571 --> 00:13:51.310
scientific studies that have come out,

236
00:13:51.311 --> 00:13:56.020
explaining how the Sahara desert went from being tropical green to a desert in

237
00:13:56.021 --> 00:14:00.970
barely a century. And as recently as 4,500 years ago,

238
00:14:01.180 --> 00:14:04.990
the same general timeframe of the dates that they ascribed to the great pyramid

239
00:14:04.991 --> 00:14:08.980
and the Sphinx for being constructed. Guys, this is exciting. I mean,

240
00:14:08.981 --> 00:14:12.880
we were literally living on the precipice of learning that the earth changes

241
00:14:12.910 --> 00:14:17.500
naturally and dramatically in far shorter periods of time than what most anyone

242
00:14:17.501 --> 00:14:18.460
thought was possible.

243
00:14:18.580 --> 00:14:21.850
And I think that's exactly what happened to Egypt and why there's the true

244
00:14:21.851 --> 00:14:25.390
history of it is surrounded by so much mystery on unanswered questions.

245
00:14:25.510 --> 00:14:28.600
I really don't think that they chose to build these incredible structures in the

246
00:14:28.601 --> 00:14:33.160
middle of a barren desert, although the Nile river is there, but it seems to me,

247
00:14:33.190 --> 00:14:34.570
especially when we look at the dating,

248
00:14:34.600 --> 00:14:38.290
that it's far more likely that they've started constructing ancient Egypt at the

249
00:14:38.291 --> 00:14:41.320
same time that the Sahara was green. And by the way,

250
00:14:41.350 --> 00:14:43.360
Egypt is in the Sahara desert.

251
00:14:43.390 --> 00:14:45.870
And when you consider the 4,500 year old dates for,

252
00:14:45.871 --> 00:14:49.810
let's say Hara turning from green to desert and the alleged construction of the

253
00:14:49.811 --> 00:14:53.210
pyramids, which honestly is not surrounded by much evidence at all.

254
00:14:53.600 --> 00:14:57.560
I think this is the missing link here on explanation of why we have no idea who

255
00:14:57.561 --> 00:15:00.110
did it and when, but the point is ultimately this,

256
00:15:00.170 --> 00:15:04.190
that the true history of ancient Egyptians is many thousands of years older than

257
00:15:04.191 --> 00:15:05.024
what we were taught.

258
00:15:05.240 --> 00:15:08.150
And it's not until you look at all the little nuance details that you can start

259
00:15:08.151 --> 00:15:11.060
to understand this. And I believe that within our lifetimes,

260
00:15:11.090 --> 00:15:13.040
we are going to learn many,

261
00:15:13.070 --> 00:15:16.790
many amazing things about our true history of humanity.

262
00:15:17.240 --> 00:15:20.960
Probably the most incredible discoveries are a lifetime aside from early ones.

263
00:15:21.230 --> 00:15:25.370
Cause they're apparently already here. Um, now I have a lot more to say,

264
00:15:25.430 --> 00:15:27.350
and I couldn't be more excited about my next video,

265
00:15:27.351 --> 00:15:30.170
which is going to talk about the origins of the Egyptians and it's going to tie

266
00:15:30.171 --> 00:15:33.890
into many other things, but that video will come after I get back from Peru,

267
00:15:33.891 --> 00:15:36.800
which I'm heading out on in just a few days. That's right.

268
00:15:36.860 --> 00:15:39.680
I'm going to Peru for the very first time ever. In fact,

269
00:15:39.800 --> 00:15:43.460
my first trip ever to self the Southern hemisphere and I'm going with Brian

270
00:15:43.970 --> 00:15:46.790
Forester and Ben of uncharted X, and it is going to be amazing.

271
00:15:46.791 --> 00:15:49.760
We're going to all the notable sites and it's going to be incredible.

272
00:15:49.850 --> 00:15:53.990
I'll be taking tens of thousands of photos again and videos that will be used in

273
00:15:53.991 --> 00:15:56.810
many future videos to come, which I'm already sitting on.

274
00:15:56.990 --> 00:16:01.100
So many images there'll be used in videos from my trip to Egypt.

275
00:16:01.340 --> 00:16:03.650
And like I said, I'm going to Egypt this October again anyways.

276
00:16:03.950 --> 00:16:07.520
So I'll be able to have all kinds of great videos to come. Um,

277
00:16:07.550 --> 00:16:08.780
but let me see here,

278
00:16:08.930 --> 00:16:12.290
follow me on Instagram because that's where we'll be uploading photos and videos

279
00:16:12.291 --> 00:16:14.660
and blogs daily. So it's bright insight.

280
00:16:14.661 --> 00:16:17.480
Instagram you'll find a link in the description and the pin comments,

281
00:16:17.481 --> 00:16:19.580
but with all that said, I'm going to wrap this up.

282
00:16:19.610 --> 00:16:22.640
I've got to go pack my bags for Peru, but my name's Jimmy,

283
00:16:22.670 --> 00:16:24.170
my channel is called bright insights,

284
00:16:24.380 --> 00:16:26.780
hit the like button and subscribe and leave a comments,

285
00:16:26.781 --> 00:16:30.530
sharing your thoughts on these relics on the 7,000 year-old Austra jig,

286
00:16:30.531 --> 00:16:33.950
which with pyramids on them. I mean, if you think they're mountains, explain,

287
00:16:33.951 --> 00:16:38.420
leave a smart comment and explain a way. Cause it just seems, I mean,

288
00:16:38.421 --> 00:16:39.740
I think they're pyramids, just look at them,

289
00:16:39.741 --> 00:16:43.580
but that's also talk and leave a comment about the wood being found in the

290
00:16:43.581 --> 00:16:48.440
pyramid being hundreds of years older than age of the pyramids itself.

291
00:16:48.470 --> 00:16:51.590
I mean, what's the explanation for that as well as leave a comments,

292
00:16:51.620 --> 00:16:55.280
discussing the Spinks water erosion. That's something people, like I said,

293
00:16:55.281 --> 00:16:57.980
it's undeniable, but people still debate it,

294
00:16:57.981 --> 00:17:00.890
but it's kind of hard to understand because it's like the water erosions there.

295
00:17:00.891 --> 00:17:04.430
So when are they suggesting it happened and how, I mean,

296
00:17:04.460 --> 00:17:07.010
it was buried for the last few thousand years. I already said this.

297
00:17:07.160 --> 00:17:11.000
I'll wrap this up anyways. Again, I'm Jimmy with channels called bright insight.

298
00:17:11.390 --> 00:17:12.230
Take care, everybody.
