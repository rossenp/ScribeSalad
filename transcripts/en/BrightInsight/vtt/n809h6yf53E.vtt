00:00:00.590 --> 00:00:05.000
<v 0>Does anyone else find it really odd that despite the overwhelming similarities</v>

2
00:00:05.001 --> 00:00:09.000
between the Egyptians and the Incas, that mainstream scientists,

3
00:00:09.001 --> 00:00:13.440
archeologists and the textbooks that are being taught in school completely omit

4
00:00:13.460 --> 00:00:16.160
any of this information. Take, for example,

5
00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:21.190
the step pyramids that are found both in Peru, ancient Egypt in Cambodia.

6
00:00:21.740 --> 00:00:26.230
Does anyone else think that that's an accident or just a coincidence? Well,

7
00:00:26.231 --> 00:00:27.630
wait a second. Wait a second.

8
00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:30.830
<v 1>The ancients were dumb. Of course, it's a coincidence.</v>

9
00:00:30.980 --> 00:00:33.350
Heck if you give some kids some toy blocks,

10
00:00:33.351 --> 00:00:34.750
they're gonna build random things up.

11
00:00:34.751 --> 00:00:36.990
And of course you're gonna find similarities somewhere. Right.

12
00:00:37.810 --> 00:00:38.460
But wait a second.

13
00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:43.460
What about the incredible similarities use of trap OID doors found both with the

14
00:00:43.510 --> 00:00:47.460
Incas and in the Egyptian cultures trap OID doors,

15
00:00:48.110 --> 00:00:50.460
never mind that that's only found in those two cultures.

16
00:00:50.690 --> 00:00:54.820
It's obviously definitive evidence that they were so primitive that they were

17
00:00:55.010 --> 00:00:57.580
incapable of building anything with the straight line.

18
00:00:58.240 --> 00:01:02.370
<v 0>But what about the incredible similarities of the use of gold fee funeral masks</v>

19
00:01:02.510 --> 00:01:06.970
on their mummies or the fact that both these cultures would cross the arms of

20
00:01:06.971 --> 00:01:10.930
their mummies gold funeral masks? So what in fact,

21
00:01:10.931 --> 00:01:14.010
if anything that just proves that they didn't have the ability to dip them in

22
00:01:14.011 --> 00:01:18.010
Roadium and make white gold obviously, and crossing the arms of the mummies. Oh,

23
00:01:18.011 --> 00:01:18.830
come on.

24
00:01:18.830 --> 00:01:23.280
The ancients were cold blooded Neanderthals that probably just the bodies of the

25
00:01:23.281 --> 00:01:25.640
mummies into their sarcophagus and did away with them.

26
00:01:25.641 --> 00:01:29.000
And heck I wouldn't be surprised if the arms of the mummies just simply crossed

27
00:01:29.001 --> 00:01:33.600
over after they were dumped in by accident. Come on, wait a second though.

28
00:01:33.740 --> 00:01:37.560
How do you explain the fact that Egyptian mummies have been found with traces of

29
00:01:37.561 --> 00:01:39.760
cocaine in them? I mean,

30
00:01:39.761 --> 00:01:43.830
after all cocaine is exclusively native of south America.

31
00:01:44.650 --> 00:01:48.230
So how do you explain that Egyptian mummies would have cocaine in them despite

32
00:01:48.231 --> 00:01:51.790
the inability to cross the oceans? You're kidding. Right?

33
00:01:52.010 --> 00:01:54.550
You don't need to go to south America to get cocaine.

34
00:01:54.740 --> 00:01:57.350
Heck go to the south side of town and find yourself a corner.

35
00:01:57.450 --> 00:02:01.430
And in minutes you can land yourself. Some cocaine, God, you sound so naive,

36
00:02:02.570 --> 00:02:03.460
but wait a to second,

37
00:02:03.520 --> 00:02:07.260
how do you explain the overwhelming similarities between the architecture and

38
00:02:07.420 --> 00:02:10.980
structure and the cutting of various stones found in both of these cultures?

39
00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:15.020
In fact, the evidence is overwhelming that the exact same type of technology in

40
00:02:15.021 --> 00:02:18.980
architecture was used by multiple civilizations across multiple continents

41
00:02:18.981 --> 00:02:22.260
around the world. And it's completely unexplainable. Oh,

42
00:02:22.261 --> 00:02:24.130
really then me to tell you something,

43
00:02:24.230 --> 00:02:28.330
is there like a stamped trademark in any of these stones that prove that it's

44
00:02:28.331 --> 00:02:30.570
from the same culture? No, there isn't.

45
00:02:30.630 --> 00:02:32.290
So technically that's not proof of anything.

46
00:02:32.760 --> 00:02:36.850
Well then how do you explain the incredible similarities of the depiction of the

47
00:02:36.851 --> 00:02:40.930
third eye or the eye of hos in both cultures or even the very similar

48
00:02:40.931 --> 00:02:45.840
architecture of various buildings or the use of eye or the elongated

49
00:02:46.100 --> 00:02:50.920
skulls or even the swirl marks found in various pottery or the

50
00:02:50.921 --> 00:02:55.440
massive swirl marks found in the earth that are hundreds of meters wide. I mean,

51
00:02:55.441 --> 00:02:58.600
you can even find evidence that they worship the sun and had very similar

52
00:02:58.630 --> 00:03:02.760
animals facing the exact same positions. And these are continents apart.

53
00:03:03.190 --> 00:03:06.680
When you take all these things into consideration, how can you call all of this?

54
00:03:06.710 --> 00:03:10.160
Just a coincidence. You know what, let me ask you a question.

55
00:03:10.460 --> 00:03:14.120
Has any of this been verified and agreed upon by peer reviewed science? No,

56
00:03:14.260 --> 00:03:17.560
it hasn't. They don't agree with it. So it can't be true. In fact,

57
00:03:17.600 --> 00:03:19.990
I don't wanna hear anymore, you know, leave me alone, leave me alone. I'm right.

58
00:03:19.991 --> 00:03:23.510
You're wrong. I don't, I hate change. In fact, you know what? I've heard enough.

59
00:03:23.850 --> 00:03:25.150
I'm gonna go put my GMO,

60
00:03:25.350 --> 00:03:28.830
rid frozen dinner in the microwave and eat up cuz there's obviously nothing to

61
00:03:28.831 --> 00:03:33.590
see here. All right. All jokes aside. I save the best for last DNA evidence.

62
00:03:33.850 --> 00:03:37.950
How do you explain the fact that 30% of all native American DNA is middle

63
00:03:37.951 --> 00:03:39.780
Eastern? Right? In fact,

64
00:03:39.781 --> 00:03:42.980
this was verified about a year and a half ago and scientists have no explanation

65
00:03:42.981 --> 00:03:43.980
for this. In fact,

66
00:03:43.981 --> 00:03:48.740
it completely debunks the known and currently accepted human migration

67
00:03:48.741 --> 00:03:51.700
patterns that have been discussed in textbooks for decades.

68
00:03:52.360 --> 00:03:54.140
But if you wanna hear something even more crazy,

69
00:03:54.290 --> 00:03:56.660
they're finding that in various areas of south America,

70
00:03:57.080 --> 00:04:01.490
the DNA originates from get this Aborigines from Australia

71
00:04:02.150 --> 00:04:06.650
and it dates back to 17,000 years ago. So how do you explain that?

72
00:04:06.990 --> 00:04:10.810
And I should mention that I'm citing a study done by Harvard and they have

73
00:04:10.811 --> 00:04:13.810
absolutely no explanation for this. In fact, they're dumbfounded.

74
00:04:13.840 --> 00:04:15.170
They have no explanation.

75
00:04:15.310 --> 00:04:19.010
So the only logical explanation is that Plato is right and that many other

76
00:04:19.011 --> 00:04:22.880
civilizations were when they carved in stone and stated that there was once an

77
00:04:22.881 --> 00:04:27.120
advanced civilization that was capable of traveling between the continents also

78
00:04:27.121 --> 00:04:28.960
known as Atlantis. I mean,

79
00:04:28.961 --> 00:04:32.840
when you consider that Aboriginal DNA is found in south America as far back as

80
00:04:33.120 --> 00:04:34.560
17,000 years ago.

81
00:04:34.860 --> 00:04:38.280
And then when you consider that there was a global cataly that happened 13,000

82
00:04:38.281 --> 00:04:39.114
years ago,

83
00:04:39.550 --> 00:04:43.550
it's obvious that there global reset button on ancient human civilization and

84
00:04:43.551 --> 00:04:46.550
that we were once far more advanced than our textbooks currently teach in

85
00:04:46.551 --> 00:04:49.830
school. And that we were able to travel between the continents. I mean,

86
00:04:49.930 --> 00:04:53.830
DNA evidence and evidence found with cocaine in these mummies and all the

87
00:04:53.831 --> 00:04:58.310
overwhelming similarities makes it completely conclusive that these two cultures

88
00:04:58.500 --> 00:05:02.260
were obviously connected in more ways than we can possibly imagine today,

89
00:05:02.930 --> 00:05:05.620
real quick. I need to mention that everything that I share with you today,

90
00:05:05.820 --> 00:05:08.820
I couldn't have done without the works of humans are free.com.

91
00:05:09.240 --> 00:05:12.260
The works of Richard Castero, who has his own YouTube channel,

92
00:05:12.261 --> 00:05:15.980
which you need to check out as well as Richard castero.com and check out his

93
00:05:15.981 --> 00:05:18.380
book called the missing link written in stone.

94
00:05:18.980 --> 00:05:23.330
I also utilize photos from Graham hancock.com as well as an article by BARR

95
00:05:23.470 --> 00:05:25.570
Manson with ancient origins.net.

96
00:05:25.840 --> 00:05:29.850
There's so much evidence that the history of human civilization is far older and

97
00:05:29.851 --> 00:05:33.170
was once far more advanced than we were ever taught in school or is currently

98
00:05:33.171 --> 00:05:36.810
being taught in school today. Anyways, guys, I'm Jimmy, this is bright insight.

99
00:05:37.010 --> 00:05:37.650
Like can subscribe.

100
00:05:37.650 --> 00:05:41.010
I have many other videos for you to enjoy on a whole wide variety of topics.

101
00:05:41.440 --> 00:05:42.320
Take care of buddy.
