00:00:00.900 --> 00:00:05.250
<v 0>By now you're probably aware that the sealed 30 ton black granite sarcophagus</v>

2
00:00:05.251 --> 00:00:06.270
has been opened,

3
00:00:06.271 --> 00:00:11.010
which was recently discovered in Alexandria Egypt and made headlines around the

4
00:00:11.011 --> 00:00:11.311
world.

5
00:00:11.311 --> 00:00:16.200
As everyone waited to see what would be found inside and speculation flourished

6
00:00:16.201 --> 00:00:20.370
on the internet and in the news with suggestions ranging from ancient Egyptian

7
00:00:20.371 --> 00:00:24.300
mummies, containing riches and treasure to the last remains of Alexander.

8
00:00:24.301 --> 00:00:29.220
The great to even an ancient curse that would lead to a zombie apocalypse,

9
00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:33.090
but what they did find where the gruesome remains of three mummies,

10
00:00:33.091 --> 00:00:37.770
or should I say skulls with their skeletons along with a disgusting

11
00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:40.290
and horrendously foul odor red sewage,

12
00:00:40.291 --> 00:00:44.160
which I'll be discussing and sharing more photos of in just a moment.

13
00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:45.510
But first of all,

14
00:00:45.540 --> 00:00:48.840
there is way more to this story than the pictures and the details that were

15
00:00:48.841 --> 00:00:50.010
reported by the news,

16
00:00:50.011 --> 00:00:53.520
because a few things that they shared about it just do not add up.

17
00:00:53.580 --> 00:00:54.570
And in this video,

18
00:00:54.571 --> 00:00:57.720
I'm going to connect the dots and some really interesting information about

19
00:00:57.721 --> 00:00:57.991
this,

20
00:00:57.991 --> 00:01:01.980
as well as share additional photos that didn't make the headline articles going

21
00:01:01.981 --> 00:01:04.440
around the world on this topic now real quick,

22
00:01:04.441 --> 00:01:08.010
if you haven't watched my previous video that I made before the sarcophagus was

23
00:01:08.011 --> 00:01:08.460
opened,

24
00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:12.060
be sure to check that out and I'll include a link pop up at the end of this

25
00:01:12.061 --> 00:01:12.391
video,

26
00:01:12.391 --> 00:01:15.990
so you can watch it as I discussed many interesting details that I won't be

27
00:01:15.991 --> 00:01:17.610
mentioning again in this video.

28
00:01:17.970 --> 00:01:21.900
But one point that I did make was that the opening of this sarcophagus should be

29
00:01:21.901 --> 00:01:24.780
done on live TV or through live streaming,

30
00:01:25.050 --> 00:01:29.550
which ultimately did not happen and is a total shame for a variety of

31
00:01:29.551 --> 00:01:34.530
reasons that aside the process of opening the sarcophagus was very difficult.

32
00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:39.480
The pit that is buried in is 16 and a half feet or five meters deep.

33
00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:43.680
And it's easier to appreciate just how deep that is when you see pictures of it.

34
00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:47.820
And you can see here that the even tide two ladders together to climb down into

35
00:01:47.821 --> 00:01:51.360
the pit, to open the lid, which was sealed with a thick mortar,

36
00:01:51.510 --> 00:01:55.350
the utilize wedges to pry it open and then stack wood in between the lid and the

37
00:01:55.351 --> 00:01:56.880
sarcophagus to elevate it.

38
00:01:57.570 --> 00:01:59.970
But something happened as soon as they cracked it open.

39
00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:04.890
The smell of the red sewage inside was so pungent that they had to stop working

40
00:02:04.891 --> 00:02:06.780
and leave the pit. In fact,

41
00:02:06.781 --> 00:02:10.380
the smell was so bad that at first they thought that the fumes could be lethally

42
00:02:10.381 --> 00:02:14.310
toxic. So they put on surgical masks before continuing.

43
00:02:14.311 --> 00:02:16.620
And in this photo, you can actually see here,

44
00:02:17.220 --> 00:02:19.440
Mustapha was Ziri the secretary general of Egypt,

45
00:02:19.441 --> 00:02:24.150
Supreme council of antiquities being the very first person to look and see

46
00:02:24.151 --> 00:02:26.310
what's inside this massive stone box.

47
00:02:26.730 --> 00:02:31.290
And this here is what he saw the pool of a red colored sewage that they

48
00:02:31.291 --> 00:02:36.180
claimed must have leaked into the sarcophagus at some point after it was buried.

49
00:02:36.600 --> 00:02:40.680
So at this time they decided to completely remove the massive 15 ton lid.

50
00:02:40.681 --> 00:02:41.700
And when I say massive,

51
00:02:41.701 --> 00:02:45.450
you have to compare it to the size of people to truly appreciate it.

52
00:02:45.570 --> 00:02:48.960
But the whole sarcophagus itself measures nearly nine feet long,

53
00:02:48.990 --> 00:02:51.930
five and a half feet wide and six feet tall.

54
00:02:52.320 --> 00:02:54.660
And you can see the metric conversion here in this photo,

55
00:02:55.110 --> 00:02:56.670
but to lift and remove the lid,

56
00:02:56.671 --> 00:03:00.910
they of course do use heavy machinery a crane do so, and just look at this lid.

57
00:03:00.911 --> 00:03:04.000
Isn't that thing amazing. Of course, in my prior video,

58
00:03:04.001 --> 00:03:07.180
I discussed the issues involved with cutting and carving this black granite

59
00:03:07.181 --> 00:03:12.130
stone and how saw us as theorized by Egyptologists and archeologists could not

60
00:03:12.131 --> 00:03:15.340
have done this, especially not with this level of precision.

61
00:03:15.670 --> 00:03:19.060
And I also mentioned how archeologists suggest that ropes and pulleys were used

62
00:03:19.061 --> 00:03:21.550
by the ancients to lift or lower heavy stones.

63
00:03:21.551 --> 00:03:24.970
And although I do not doubt the use of police by the ancients,

64
00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:29.320
it must be mentioned that no police or ropes have ever been found from the

65
00:03:29.321 --> 00:03:33.400
ancient Egyptians that were large enough or strong enough to have sustained this

66
00:03:33.401 --> 00:03:37.600
level of weight. But that of course does not mean that they didn't exist either,

67
00:03:37.660 --> 00:03:41.650
but it's just important for everyone to see what it takes in modern times to

68
00:03:41.651 --> 00:03:45.400
lift something of this weight, a massive fricking hydraulic crane.

69
00:03:45.730 --> 00:03:46.563
And while we're at it,

70
00:03:46.570 --> 00:03:50.110
look at the surroundings of where this was found in the middle of the densely

71
00:03:50.111 --> 00:03:52.900
populated city of Alexandria Egypt.

72
00:03:53.110 --> 00:03:56.890
So it of course makes you wonder what else could be buried in the immediate area

73
00:03:56.891 --> 00:04:00.760
around it. What is hidden just meters underneath these buildings here?

74
00:04:00.760 --> 00:04:04.570
And don't forget that this sarcophagus was discovered by accident by a

75
00:04:04.571 --> 00:04:06.700
construction crew working on the new building,

76
00:04:07.060 --> 00:04:10.210
but getting back to the red sewage that was found inside the sarcophagus,

77
00:04:10.211 --> 00:04:12.160
it must be mentioned that in the three weeks,

78
00:04:12.161 --> 00:04:14.650
since the discovery and prior to opening it,

79
00:04:15.070 --> 00:04:18.070
there was no smell or evidence of sewage within the pit.

80
00:04:18.910 --> 00:04:22.360
We all remember the considerable amount of speculation about what could be

81
00:04:22.361 --> 00:04:26.620
hidden inside and not one single person involved with this discovery said

82
00:04:26.621 --> 00:04:30.250
anything about the smell of death emitting from the seal box.

83
00:04:30.700 --> 00:04:34.240
And let's not forget that they were very specific and stating that the lid was

84
00:04:34.780 --> 00:04:37.750
steeled with thick mortar. So wait a second.

85
00:04:37.780 --> 00:04:42.100
If sewage was somehow able to leak into this sealed sarcophagus at some point,

86
00:04:42.370 --> 00:04:44.200
which is exactly what they stated about,

87
00:04:44.230 --> 00:04:48.040
it's why then couldn't they smell it until after the lid had already been

88
00:04:48.041 --> 00:04:48.910
opened. I mean,

89
00:04:49.240 --> 00:04:53.110
they specifically stated that it wasn't until after the pride opened the lid

90
00:04:53.111 --> 00:04:56.950
that they could smell it. And again, we can see that before it was open,

91
00:04:56.951 --> 00:05:01.210
nobody was wearing masks and once they cracked it open, they all did. I mean,

92
00:05:01.211 --> 00:05:04.420
I wasn't there. So I obviously do not know all the details involved,

93
00:05:04.421 --> 00:05:09.280
but what makes them so sure that this sewage came from outside and leaked

94
00:05:09.281 --> 00:05:10.114
its way in,

95
00:05:10.150 --> 00:05:13.780
because it seems to me that this red sewage is actually what's left of the

96
00:05:13.781 --> 00:05:17.590
decayed bodily fluids of the three individuals that they found inside.

97
00:05:18.010 --> 00:05:20.650
They of course pump the fluid out. And when they did,

98
00:05:20.710 --> 00:05:24.640
this is what you could see. Absolutely disgusting. Right?

99
00:05:25.210 --> 00:05:28.480
What you're looking at are the skeletal remains of three individuals.

100
00:05:28.481 --> 00:05:32.500
And here are the other photos provided by Egyptian antiquities where you can see

101
00:05:32.501 --> 00:05:37.000
it from above and also photos of the three skulls that they pulled from it.

102
00:05:37.870 --> 00:05:41.770
So there's a few things to discuss about this first is that the only thing

103
00:05:41.771 --> 00:05:46.420
inside were the bones and the fluid, nothing else, no clothing,

104
00:05:46.450 --> 00:05:49.420
no jewelry, just bones and sewage.

105
00:05:49.660 --> 00:05:51.790
And you can see that came from two different sources.

106
00:05:51.791 --> 00:05:56.230
So it sounds like these three people were essentially naked when they were put

107
00:05:56.231 --> 00:05:59.930
into this box. And well, I'll discuss more about that in a second,

108
00:06:00.500 --> 00:06:04.670
but Mostafa was Zuri also clarified that none of the mummies belonged to the

109
00:06:04.671 --> 00:06:07.790
telomeric period, which is about 2300 years ago,

110
00:06:08.150 --> 00:06:09.710
as was previously suggested,

111
00:06:09.740 --> 00:06:13.970
particularly due to the alabaster head found not far from this sarcophagus,

112
00:06:14.540 --> 00:06:18.050
it's been suggested that the three individuals could have been warriors or

113
00:06:18.051 --> 00:06:20.090
soldiers during the time of the pharaohs.

114
00:06:20.091 --> 00:06:23.660
And they suggest this due to the trauma to one of the skulls found,

115
00:06:23.661 --> 00:06:25.790
which could be from an arrow through the head.

116
00:06:26.330 --> 00:06:29.390
Obviously this is all speculation. It could be true,

117
00:06:29.391 --> 00:06:33.830
but we really have no idea because there was nothing found in this stone box

118
00:06:33.860 --> 00:06:35.060
other than the bones.

119
00:06:35.300 --> 00:06:39.350
And what I believe to be the leftover indicated bodily fluids of these three

120
00:06:39.351 --> 00:06:42.800
naked dead people found inside of it. Additionally,

121
00:06:42.801 --> 00:06:47.420
there were no inscriptions or works of art of any kind within the box or outside

122
00:06:47.421 --> 00:06:49.490
of it, which is actually highly unusual.

123
00:06:49.910 --> 00:06:54.140
And here you can see a similar example of a sarcophagus of this kind and all the

124
00:06:54.141 --> 00:06:57.830
incredible hieroglyphs found both in and outside of it.

125
00:06:58.220 --> 00:07:02.630
So there are none found on the newly discovered sarcophagus and yet various news

126
00:07:02.631 --> 00:07:06.230
outlets are still suggesting that the box is from the Ptolemaic period,

127
00:07:06.231 --> 00:07:09.620
which is certainly ridiculous. It's beyond clear,

128
00:07:09.650 --> 00:07:11.270
this box was reused.

129
00:07:11.540 --> 00:07:15.620
And the three people found inside were not the original person or things meant

130
00:07:15.621 --> 00:07:18.710
for it. One thing that stood out to me were the skulls.

131
00:07:18.710 --> 00:07:22.970
At least one of them appears to be a bit small and I am by no means an expert on

132
00:07:22.971 --> 00:07:24.080
skeletal remains.

133
00:07:24.890 --> 00:07:28.160
And it was actually suggested that this was perhaps a family burial,

134
00:07:28.190 --> 00:07:32.780
but maybe these were young adults, a female who knows. But again,

135
00:07:32.810 --> 00:07:34.730
these people were apparently buried,

136
00:07:34.731 --> 00:07:39.020
naked and left with no type of inscription or marker of any kind on their grave,

137
00:07:39.440 --> 00:07:41.570
which is a bit suspicious. I can't help,

138
00:07:41.571 --> 00:07:46.130
but think that perhaps three people went missing thousands of years ago and

139
00:07:46.131 --> 00:07:49.400
someone got rid of the bodies in a way that nobody should ever find them.

140
00:07:49.401 --> 00:07:50.600
I mean, think about it.

141
00:07:51.050 --> 00:07:55.220
They were murdered and dumped naked into the stone box and it was sealed up.

142
00:07:55.970 --> 00:07:59.870
The remains are actually now being moved to the Alexandria national restoration

143
00:07:59.871 --> 00:08:03.740
museum where they will be examined to identify cause of death and possible age.

144
00:08:04.250 --> 00:08:07.520
And the sarcophagus is being sent to a military museum.

145
00:08:07.940 --> 00:08:12.410
So here is something that you're pretty much guaranteed to find disgusting slash

146
00:08:12.440 --> 00:08:15.920
disturbing. Remember that red sewage that they found inside,

147
00:08:16.550 --> 00:08:18.230
guess what they decided to do with it.

148
00:08:18.380 --> 00:08:21.260
They kept some samples of it to be analyzed.

149
00:08:21.680 --> 00:08:24.980
And the rest was literally dumped into the street.

150
00:08:24.981 --> 00:08:27.440
And you can actually watch video of it here on YouTube.

151
00:08:27.830 --> 00:08:29.390
And you can even tell when watching it,

152
00:08:29.391 --> 00:08:33.200
that this guy's face reeked of guilt and the people watching and taking photos

153
00:08:33.201 --> 00:08:36.530
around him. And although they were speaking Arabic and I couldn't understand it,

154
00:08:37.070 --> 00:08:40.280
it seemed that they were giving this guy for doing what he was doing. I mean,

155
00:08:40.281 --> 00:08:44.030
pouring the foul liquid remains of human bodies into the street,

156
00:08:44.060 --> 00:08:48.080
around their homes. There are so many things wrong with this.

157
00:08:48.081 --> 00:08:51.080
And besides the fact that it's an obvious health issue to the people in the

158
00:08:51.081 --> 00:08:55.100
area, but they're also literally discarding the remaining evidence.

159
00:08:55.530 --> 00:08:59.340
I don't know how much of this ancient mummy juice they kept to be analyzed,

160
00:08:59.370 --> 00:09:04.350
but this is a profound example of the reckless negligent behavior on behalf of

161
00:09:04.351 --> 00:09:06.960
the Egyptian antiquities and excavations.

162
00:09:07.530 --> 00:09:09.600
Do you see what I mean with all of this said,

163
00:09:09.601 --> 00:09:13.020
it will be interesting to see pictures of this sarcophagus once it is cleaned

164
00:09:13.021 --> 00:09:16.530
out, but it really makes you wonder what was originally inside of it.

165
00:09:16.650 --> 00:09:20.970
Clearly this thing was reused and there is certainly way more to the story than

166
00:09:20.971 --> 00:09:24.870
meets the eye. I mean, think about what an incredible mystery this is.

167
00:09:25.110 --> 00:09:28.770
People went to an incredible extent to cut and carved the stone block,

168
00:09:29.100 --> 00:09:33.330
which was more than 66,000 pounds or more than 30 metric tons

169
00:09:33.870 --> 00:09:38.370
all to just dump three naked bodies in it with no inscription of any kind.

170
00:09:38.970 --> 00:09:42.210
No, no, no, no. There is way more to this story than meets the eye,

171
00:09:42.211 --> 00:09:45.390
like I said earlier, and I'm very curious to see what your thoughts are.
