00:00:00.810 --> 00:00:01.201
<v 0>If you,</v>

2
00:00:01.201 --> 00:00:06.000
weren't already convinced that Carol Baskin from the hit Netflix TV show tiger

3
00:00:06.001 --> 00:00:10.890
king is responsible for what happened to her, then husband, Don Lewis. Well,

4
00:00:10.891 --> 00:00:12.240
by the end of this video,

5
00:00:12.270 --> 00:00:16.650
you will be absolutely certain that she is responsible for his disappearance.

6
00:00:16.651 --> 00:00:18.300
And by disappearance, let's be real.

7
00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:22.380
We're talking about his murder because I did some digging and I couldn't believe

8
00:00:22.381 --> 00:00:24.450
what I found. And in this video,

9
00:00:24.451 --> 00:00:28.020
I'm going to share with you two separate examples of new information that was

10
00:00:28.021 --> 00:00:31.290
not included in that show. That is so incredible.

11
00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:35.070
It'll likely make your jaw drop. I'm not kidding. Now on this channel,

12
00:00:35.071 --> 00:00:37.710
most of my videos are on ancient civilizations. However,

13
00:00:37.711 --> 00:00:39.720
I've also discussed in different videos,

14
00:00:39.721 --> 00:00:44.640
conspiracies ranging from JFK to Nikola Tesla and other

15
00:00:44.641 --> 00:00:45.930
topics as well. In fact,

16
00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:50.550
even some of my earliest videos on this channel involved making a murderer and

17
00:00:50.551 --> 00:00:51.450
Blackfish.

18
00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:55.230
So now that I've been cooped up in my house for the last few weeks with my dogs,

19
00:00:55.770 --> 00:01:00.330
because of the ongoing coronavirus lockdowns, I just can't help myself.

20
00:01:00.360 --> 00:01:03.390
But to make a video that exposes a real life murderer,

21
00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:08.310
especially considering that Netflix is adding a brand new bonus episode to the

22
00:01:08.311 --> 00:01:12.630
tiger king series, which airs tomorrow, Sunday, April 12th.

23
00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:16.290
But before I share the bombshell new information, this would be real.

24
00:01:16.620 --> 00:01:21.480
Most people are already convinced that Carol fuqing Baskins did it

25
00:01:21.510 --> 00:01:24.420
just from watching episode three of that tiger king series.

26
00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:29.520
Literally everyone in Don Lewis's entire life thinks that he was murdered

27
00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:30.870
and Carol did it.

28
00:01:31.410 --> 00:01:36.090
Even his own kids and his ex-wife are completely certain that Carol is involved.

29
00:01:36.091 --> 00:01:40.050
In fact, that'd be quote, gladly Lewis, Don Lewis, his ex-wife, as she said,

30
00:01:40.440 --> 00:01:44.370
the last day I saw Don. He told me that he was done,

31
00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:46.140
that he was divorcing her.

32
00:01:46.440 --> 00:01:50.460
And that Carol was one of the worst people he ever met in his life.

33
00:01:50.610 --> 00:01:55.560
And that she was very dangerous. Even Don's old business associates,

34
00:01:55.561 --> 00:01:59.790
Wendell Williams stated that the very last time he saw Don Lewis,

35
00:02:00.120 --> 00:02:04.260
Don had told him that he was going to tell Carol that he wanted a divorce.

36
00:02:04.860 --> 00:02:08.880
And when the went on to say that Don was preparing his estate and assets in such

37
00:02:08.881 --> 00:02:13.170
a way that he could get a divorce from Carol without losing everything. In fact,

38
00:02:13.171 --> 00:02:14.070
he said that he was,

39
00:02:14.280 --> 00:02:18.600
or that it was his impression that Don fought that Carol was there only for the

40
00:02:18.601 --> 00:02:22.530
purpose of getting his money, which was what Don was trying to protect.

41
00:02:22.920 --> 00:02:26.970
And then boom, Don went missing forever. Think about that.

42
00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:31.290
The very last time he saw him, that's what Don told him. And by the way,

43
00:02:31.710 --> 00:02:35.700
that was even corroborated by Kenny Farr, who was Dawn's longtime handyman.

44
00:02:35.910 --> 00:02:39.420
He said that Don was setting up for a divorce in a way that Carol would have

45
00:02:39.690 --> 00:02:43.560
gotten nothing. She would have lost all the big cats been left with no money,

46
00:02:43.620 --> 00:02:46.080
even losing the house and the car in the process.

47
00:02:46.290 --> 00:02:50.460
So think about that after 16 years of marriage and being humiliated as Don

48
00:02:50.461 --> 00:02:51.840
cheated on her left and right,

49
00:02:51.841 --> 00:02:55.920
which no one denies and then to be left with absolutely nothing.

50
00:02:56.730 --> 00:02:58.440
That sounds like potential motive to me.

51
00:02:58.890 --> 00:03:03.070
And when you consider what Carol wrote in her own diary, which Joe exotic,

52
00:03:03.100 --> 00:03:05.530
somehow got a copy of, which is pretty hilarious.

53
00:03:05.531 --> 00:03:09.160
I'd like to know how we got that, but she did say, and I quote,

54
00:03:09.250 --> 00:03:12.700
I listened while he told me that all of his money and everything he earned by

55
00:03:12.701 --> 00:03:16.780
himself and brought into this marriage by himself was his.

56
00:03:17.230 --> 00:03:22.030
And she went on to say that I wish there was some way out for me if

57
00:03:22.031 --> 00:03:25.240
that's not suspicious enough, that me mentioned what Mark McCarthy,

58
00:03:25.241 --> 00:03:30.040
who was another business associate of Don's stated that one month before Dawn's

59
00:03:30.041 --> 00:03:31.030
disappearance,

60
00:03:31.180 --> 00:03:36.070
Don had told him that he felt that his life was in danger Jesus.

61
00:03:36.130 --> 00:03:40.000
And if that's not enough witnesses, look at what Anne McQueen stated,

62
00:03:40.001 --> 00:03:41.740
who was Don's executive assistant,

63
00:03:41.741 --> 00:03:45.940
who many considered to have been his most trusted person that Don knew as she

64
00:03:45.941 --> 00:03:48.910
was literally in charge of all of his assets. And not only that,

65
00:03:49.150 --> 00:03:53.020
he trusted her so much that she was his power of attorney.

66
00:03:53.620 --> 00:03:55.870
If that's not trust, I don't know what it is,

67
00:03:56.290 --> 00:03:59.740
but get this and stated that not long before he disappeared,

68
00:03:59.770 --> 00:04:04.570
Don started to act funny. And the very last time that she saw Don alive,

69
00:04:04.810 --> 00:04:07.480
he gave her an envelope that had a piece of paper in it.

70
00:04:07.690 --> 00:04:11.020
And Don told her that she needed to take it home and keep it safe.

71
00:04:11.380 --> 00:04:13.990
Adding that if anything ever happened to him,

72
00:04:14.200 --> 00:04:17.590
she needed to give the envelope to the police. Well,

73
00:04:17.591 --> 00:04:21.640
it turned out that inside that very envelope was a copy of a restraining order

74
00:04:21.641 --> 00:04:26.530
that Don had filed on Carol Baskins barely two months before his disappearance,

75
00:04:26.860 --> 00:04:29.380
the restraining order stated. And I quote,

76
00:04:29.680 --> 00:04:33.070
this is the second time Carol has got angry enough to threaten,

77
00:04:33.071 --> 00:04:37.240
to kill me going on to say that Carol got into a big fuss,

78
00:04:37.420 --> 00:04:38.710
ordered me out of the house,

79
00:04:38.770 --> 00:04:42.580
or she would kill me and adding at the end in parentheses,

80
00:04:42.880 --> 00:04:47.560
she has an H five revolver and she took my 3 57 and hid it.

81
00:04:48.310 --> 00:04:51.430
Don filed that restraining order in June and in August,

82
00:04:51.431 --> 00:04:55.990
he went missing and was never seen or heard of again. Um,

83
00:04:56.050 --> 00:04:58.360
wow. Right? And if that's not enough,

84
00:04:58.361 --> 00:05:02.080
the fact that everyone had Don's life thinks that he was murdered and that Carol

85
00:05:02.081 --> 00:05:05.440
did it. I didn't even mention the Don's old lawyer.

86
00:05:05.441 --> 00:05:09.430
Joseph Fritz thinks that Don was indeed murdered. And if you watch the series,

87
00:05:09.730 --> 00:05:13.390
it could not have been more obvious that he thinks Carol is the one who did it,

88
00:05:13.391 --> 00:05:17.170
although he refused to say it. But again, if all of that isn't enough.

89
00:05:17.380 --> 00:05:20.080
Let me now get to the two bombshells that I mentioned earlier,

90
00:05:21.430 --> 00:05:24.010
which brings me back to the restraining order.

91
00:05:24.310 --> 00:05:26.830
You may be shocked to hear that the restraining order,

92
00:05:26.980 --> 00:05:31.960
the Don Lewis filed against Carol was not the only restraining order ever filed

93
00:05:31.961 --> 00:05:36.910
against her. We all know that Carol is now married to good old Howard Baskin.

94
00:05:37.090 --> 00:05:40.540
They met in 2002 and were married in 2004,

95
00:05:40.541 --> 00:05:45.520
but before she met Howard, Carol had another boyfriend named Jay Bakel,

96
00:05:45.521 --> 00:05:49.120
who lived with her. And in 2002, at the end of their relationship,

97
00:05:49.780 --> 00:05:54.610
Jay filed a restraining order on Carol stating that he feared for his life.

98
00:05:55.390 --> 00:05:59.360
That's right. And you can even see the police reports online for yourself.

99
00:05:59.361 --> 00:06:01.940
In fact, I'll put a link in the description of this video.

100
00:06:02.270 --> 00:06:07.010
Jay wrote that he was in fear of danger of serious bodily injury or death going

101
00:06:07.011 --> 00:06:10.970
on to cite Carol's missing ex-husband who was presumed dead.

102
00:06:10.970 --> 00:06:13.400
And that Carol was a suspect in that case,

103
00:06:13.880 --> 00:06:17.390
Jay goes on to write that he asked Carol what happens when her missing

104
00:06:17.391 --> 00:06:22.220
ex-husband Don shows back up and Carol replied dead bodies

105
00:06:22.221 --> 00:06:24.920
can't talk, oh my Lord.

106
00:06:24.950 --> 00:06:27.770
He even goes on to write that even Carol's daughter,

107
00:06:27.771 --> 00:06:32.270
Jamie warned that Carol is dangerous and that he should watch his back.

108
00:06:32.900 --> 00:06:36.050
And if all of that isn't crazy enough in the same paragraph,

109
00:06:36.051 --> 00:06:40.100
he mentions that when human bones were found by the authorities behind some

110
00:06:40.220 --> 00:06:41.480
local RV center,

111
00:06:41.990 --> 00:06:45.500
Carol had said that she hopes the bones were not found on her property.

112
00:06:45.590 --> 00:06:50.090
Otherwise she would be in deep. Now I looked up that RV center,

113
00:06:50.091 --> 00:06:52.580
wondering if it neighbored her own property,

114
00:06:52.610 --> 00:06:56.360
but it appears to be more than 25 miles away from big cat rescue.

115
00:06:57.020 --> 00:06:59.780
That is unless the location moved in the last 20 years,

116
00:06:59.781 --> 00:07:04.490
or if Carol wants owned property by this RV center, either way,

117
00:07:04.520 --> 00:07:08.180
I'd be curious to know more from Jay, but isn't that nuts.

118
00:07:08.270 --> 00:07:12.860
A second person who had an intimate relationship with Carol filed a restraining

119
00:07:12.861 --> 00:07:17.060
order on her at a fear of their own life filed an actual police report went to

120
00:07:17.061 --> 00:07:21.410
that extent. And one of who of which went missing forever,

121
00:07:21.920 --> 00:07:24.620
that's what you would call a red flag. But if that's not enough,

122
00:07:24.680 --> 00:07:28.010
then they go on to bombshell. Number two, as we know,

123
00:07:28.520 --> 00:07:31.910
Caroletta husband before Don Lewis and his name is Michael Murdoch,

124
00:07:32.150 --> 00:07:35.030
who she had a daughter with as well named Jamie, as I mentioned earlier,

125
00:07:35.480 --> 00:07:39.260
it turns out that John Rankie who you'll recognize from tiger king is Joe exotic

126
00:07:39.261 --> 00:07:43.670
zoo manager had an interview recently with David spade on his podcast.

127
00:07:44.090 --> 00:07:44.960
And what he said,

128
00:07:45.110 --> 00:07:48.260
may David Spade's jaw drop and I'm not going to lie what he said,

129
00:07:48.290 --> 00:07:50.660
made my jaw drop as well. Cause I couldn't believe it.

130
00:07:51.020 --> 00:07:55.850
He said in reference to Carol's husband, Don being missing that. And I quote,

131
00:07:56.270 --> 00:08:00.860
she's missing a husband from before that too. She has a really deep past,

132
00:08:01.010 --> 00:08:04.040
and there's some things that haven't come out yet in the episodes.

133
00:08:04.250 --> 00:08:06.290
You can go and watch that interview yourself. In fact,

134
00:08:06.291 --> 00:08:09.740
I've included a link to Spade's podcast for that video in the description,

135
00:08:10.010 --> 00:08:12.350
but are you kidding me? Is that true?

136
00:08:12.980 --> 00:08:16.700
Is Carol's first husband Michael Murdoch actually missing,

137
00:08:17.500 --> 00:08:18.530
but this is a real question.

138
00:08:18.531 --> 00:08:21.800
And it'll be interesting to see if this has mentioned in the brand new episode

139
00:08:21.801 --> 00:08:25.640
that comes out tomorrow. But think about that. This guy right here,

140
00:08:25.641 --> 00:08:27.380
look for yourself, guys. Michael Murdoch.

141
00:08:27.381 --> 00:08:30.890
Does anybody know if this guy still exists?

142
00:08:30.920 --> 00:08:32.510
Is this man alive?

143
00:08:33.200 --> 00:08:37.460
Because he is one of three husbands that Carol has been married to.

144
00:08:37.461 --> 00:08:41.930
And one of which is gone forever, obviously. So this guy,

145
00:08:42.200 --> 00:08:46.550
is he still around? I mean, just think about all this, add it all together.

146
00:08:46.730 --> 00:08:50.900
I have to ask is Carol Baskins a black widow.

147
00:08:51.440 --> 00:08:55.260
This is a serious question. Is Carol basket of black widow? Think about it.

148
00:08:55.770 --> 00:08:56.581
Hell Carol,

149
00:08:56.581 --> 00:09:01.380
even referred to Don Lewis as venomous in her own diary

150
00:09:01.381 --> 00:09:02.820
saying that she hopes that her daughter,

151
00:09:02.821 --> 00:09:07.020
Jamie never finds herself in a sick and perverted relationship like that one.

152
00:09:07.950 --> 00:09:10.140
Just think about that word. Venomous.

153
00:09:10.530 --> 00:09:13.080
Have you ever used that word or do you know anyone that's ever used that word to

154
00:09:13.081 --> 00:09:17.070
describe somebody? I mean, yeah. We have words like and you know,

155
00:09:17.130 --> 00:09:20.820
manipulator, narcissists. That's a good one, you know,

156
00:09:20.970 --> 00:09:24.240
but of all the words to call somebody venomous, it's kind of funny,

157
00:09:24.270 --> 00:09:27.600
especially coming from a potential black widow. So again,

158
00:09:27.630 --> 00:09:30.810
when you consider all the details provided by witnesses that knew Don,

159
00:09:30.811 --> 00:09:31.860
including family,

160
00:09:31.890 --> 00:09:35.310
multiple business associates and everyone else and how they all thought the

161
00:09:35.640 --> 00:09:36.473
Carol killed them.

162
00:09:36.690 --> 00:09:41.190
And when you consider the Carol had a second husband that's possibly missing and

163
00:09:41.220 --> 00:09:45.510
the pattern of multiple lovers filing restraining orders on her,

164
00:09:46.020 --> 00:09:50.070
you have to ask yourself what's really going on with her. And let me just say,

165
00:09:50.280 --> 00:09:55.080
I do not think that Howard good old Howard Baskin is in any

166
00:09:55.081 --> 00:09:58.020
immediate danger whatsoever because that's be honest.

167
00:09:58.021 --> 00:09:59.370
And this is not meant to be mean,

168
00:09:59.371 --> 00:10:04.230
but Howard is clearly a beta and something tells me that it's the

169
00:10:04.710 --> 00:10:05.850
alphas that Carol doesn't like. I mean,

170
00:10:05.851 --> 00:10:09.600
come on Don Lewis is clearly an alpha who probably slept with hundreds of women

171
00:10:09.601 --> 00:10:11.040
or at least as many as he possibly could.

172
00:10:11.041 --> 00:10:14.040
It seems like no one seems to deny that. And yeah,

173
00:10:14.041 --> 00:10:16.650
so Carol despised him accordingly. I don't even blame her,

174
00:10:16.651 --> 00:10:20.520
but when it comes to Howard, I think he's totally safe.

175
00:10:20.610 --> 00:10:25.590
I don't think she would hurt a hair on his head and less he ever decides

176
00:10:25.591 --> 00:10:30.270
to leave her because the thoughts of his submissive

177
00:10:30.300 --> 00:10:33.510
beta love attention going to another woman.

178
00:10:34.830 --> 00:10:35.663
Oh my,

179
00:10:35.700 --> 00:10:39.660
that right there will probably be way too much for Carol to possibly handle.

180
00:10:39.661 --> 00:10:44.160
And then she'll dust off that old missing 3 57 Magnum revolver.

181
00:10:45.060 --> 00:10:49.530
And maybe she would give one to a good old Howard as well. Poor guy. I don't,

182
00:10:49.590 --> 00:10:52.740
I think he thinks that she's totally innocent guys. I'm not going to lie.

183
00:10:52.741 --> 00:10:55.890
He's just man, he's a victim as well.

184
00:10:56.130 --> 00:10:59.100
But out of all of the things shared in this is I'm not a lawyer,

185
00:10:59.130 --> 00:11:03.390
but is this not enough information to at least issue a new warrant to search her

186
00:11:03.391 --> 00:11:04.950
property? I mean,

187
00:11:05.070 --> 00:11:08.940
it would be a total crime for this investigation to just not go anywhere with

188
00:11:08.970 --> 00:11:13.020
all the existing evidence that's there. I mean, this reminds me of OJ Simpson.

189
00:11:13.021 --> 00:11:16.680
I mean, it couldn't be more obvious on who did it. So yeah,

190
00:11:16.830 --> 00:11:19.980
it'll be interesting to see, but the good news is that law enforcement,

191
00:11:19.981 --> 00:11:23.970
the sheriff in that area has said and reached out to the public saying that they

192
00:11:24.030 --> 00:11:26.880
are looking for new tips and leads on this case. In fact,

193
00:11:26.881 --> 00:11:28.530
Don's old lawyer who I mentioned earlier,

194
00:11:28.531 --> 00:11:32.790
Joseph Fritz was recently interviewed since the series had aired and stated that

195
00:11:32.791 --> 00:11:36.000
he would like to work with law enforcement and providing his knowledge to help

196
00:11:36.001 --> 00:11:39.630
solve the case. So here's a question for law enforcement to ponder on.

197
00:11:40.380 --> 00:11:44.640
Carol says that Don had simply had dementia and he wandered off. And by the way,

198
00:11:44.670 --> 00:11:46.620
everyone that he knew says he did not have dementia.

199
00:11:46.621 --> 00:11:49.740
At least from the research I found. But if that was the case,

200
00:11:49.830 --> 00:11:53.380
if he was losing his mind and he had just wandered off and got lost,

201
00:11:53.381 --> 00:11:54.640
as Carol had claimed,

202
00:11:55.330 --> 00:11:59.440
then why did she wait two days to call the police when he was missing?

203
00:12:00.100 --> 00:12:03.910
If your husband had dementia and he just got lost, you would wait two full days.

204
00:12:04.740 --> 00:12:09.100
Doesn't add up. Does it now going on? Let me talk about Joe exotic.

205
00:12:09.100 --> 00:12:11.740
I think there's a lot of things that could be said about this guy and he is

206
00:12:11.741 --> 00:12:13.960
undoubtedly guilty of more than one thing,

207
00:12:14.470 --> 00:12:17.770
but I would argue that although he's done some terrible evil things,

208
00:12:18.370 --> 00:12:22.060
he's not necessarily an evil person at hearts. I mean,

209
00:12:22.650 --> 00:12:26.980
he's certainly a next level egomaniac and a massive narcissist, no doubt,

210
00:12:27.550 --> 00:12:30.250
but there is something to say about the way his big cats loved them.

211
00:12:30.251 --> 00:12:33.940
And it's interesting that Joe never got mauled to death after all those decades

212
00:12:33.941 --> 00:12:36.910
spent so closely to them or to him. And you know,

213
00:12:37.090 --> 00:12:41.380
many cat people will tell you that felines have outstanding sense in

214
00:12:41.381 --> 00:12:44.020
differentiating from good and bad people.

215
00:12:44.590 --> 00:12:49.270
And I bet anything that if you put Carol into the same exact enclosures

216
00:12:49.600 --> 00:12:53.890
with the same exact lions and tigers that Joe exotic interacted with,

217
00:12:54.430 --> 00:12:57.010
I think that they would pounce on her immediately.

218
00:12:57.010 --> 00:13:00.880
I think they'd go for her neck and I'm not kidding. I'd bet on it. You know,

219
00:13:00.881 --> 00:13:03.100
Carol even claims that she's allergic to cats now,

220
00:13:03.101 --> 00:13:04.840
but you know what something tells me.

221
00:13:04.841 --> 00:13:08.260
She just says that as an excuse to not interact with any cats at all,

222
00:13:08.650 --> 00:13:11.680
because they'd pounce on her. And I think she knows it. I could be wrong,

223
00:13:11.681 --> 00:13:12.760
but Hey,

224
00:13:13.210 --> 00:13:17.710
all I know is that she is one massive hypocrite at what she's done at big cat

225
00:13:17.740 --> 00:13:21.910
animal rescue. Let's be real. Anyways, guys, I'm going to leave it at that.

226
00:13:21.970 --> 00:13:26.050
I'm Jimmy and my channel's called bright insights and I'm excited to see the new

227
00:13:26.051 --> 00:13:29.230
episode that comes out tomorrow. And I hope you guys will watch it too. I mean,

228
00:13:29.231 --> 00:13:31.330
this show is so odd. It's so ridiculous.

229
00:13:31.840 --> 00:13:33.970
But you could say that it's hilariously riveting.

230
00:13:33.971 --> 00:13:37.030
There's something about it where it's like, well, I, I can't turn away.

231
00:13:37.030 --> 00:13:39.580
I got to watch it. Um, but anyways guys,

232
00:13:39.581 --> 00:13:41.920
I'm working on my other video a few weeks ago on Instagram.

233
00:13:41.921 --> 00:13:45.100
I posted that I was working on a fun and thought provoking video when I was

234
00:13:45.130 --> 00:13:47.380
almost done with it. But when the lockdowns went underway,

235
00:13:47.381 --> 00:13:52.150
my routine got destroyed and my attention went elsewhere looking into COVID and

236
00:13:52.180 --> 00:13:54.520
watching this fricking tiger king series and everything else.

237
00:13:54.521 --> 00:13:57.220
And I kind of put pause on that, but the good news is that I'm almost done.

238
00:13:57.221 --> 00:14:00.970
So expect that in about a week or so we can have maybe give or take,

239
00:14:01.120 --> 00:14:03.790
but it's coming soon and it's very thought provoking and I know you guys will

240
00:14:03.791 --> 00:14:05.320
enjoy it. And then after that,

241
00:14:05.321 --> 00:14:09.790
I'm working on another video involving a potential coverup involving our ancient

242
00:14:09.791 --> 00:14:13.540
past. So look forward to those videos and that's anything else comes up and the

243
00:14:13.541 --> 00:14:17.740
headlines before that, I could always put something else in its place, but yeah,

244
00:14:17.800 --> 00:14:20.110
I'll leave it at that again. I'm Jimmy channel's cup, right?

245
00:14:20.111 --> 00:14:23.920
Insight hit the like button and subscribe. If you haven't and leave a comment,

246
00:14:23.921 --> 00:14:26.740
share what your thoughts are on all of this. What do you think about Carol?

247
00:14:27.460 --> 00:14:29.680
What do you think about Joe exotic and all the rest of this?

248
00:14:29.681 --> 00:14:33.730
All I know is that this is a fun topic because it's a fricking television show

249
00:14:34.000 --> 00:14:36.370
and something to keep our minds, uh, uh,

250
00:14:36.490 --> 00:14:38.650
entertained while going through these lockdowns.

251
00:14:38.651 --> 00:14:41.890
But I hope you're all doing well. I'll leave it at that. See all real soon,

252
00:14:42.250 --> 00:14:42.970
take care, everybody.
