00:00:00.470 --> 00:00:04.640
<v 0>Legends of an ancient race of giants are shared among cultures that span across</v>

2
00:00:05.040 --> 00:00:08.840
multiple continents from around the world and are included in the most common

3
00:00:09.160 --> 00:00:13.400
religions here on earth as well, including Christianity, Judaism,

4
00:00:14.290 --> 00:00:18.920
Islam, Hinduism, and even Buddhism to name a few examples.

5
00:00:19.820 --> 00:00:20.653
In fact,

6
00:00:20.750 --> 00:00:24.790
in the Sumerians who are the earliest documented human civilization on record,

7
00:00:25.300 --> 00:00:28.550
also share details of a race of giants. Once living here on earth,

8
00:00:29.100 --> 00:00:33.350
even the ancient Greeks described the giants included among the Greek gods.

9
00:00:33.810 --> 00:00:36.710
And there are many different words that have been used to describe the race of

10
00:00:36.910 --> 00:00:41.780
massive humans, such as the Neum from the Bible, the Theo in the Quran,

11
00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:43.780
the DETA and Hinduism,

12
00:00:44.320 --> 00:00:49.020
and the Asura in Buddhism and descriptions of red-haired white skin

13
00:00:49.040 --> 00:00:52.620
giants are shared by several different native American tribes in north America

14
00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:57.460
and even reaching as far away as the Monte people in Peru, in south America.

15
00:00:58.040 --> 00:00:58.873
Now on this channel,

16
00:00:58.940 --> 00:01:03.170
I have made many videos discussing massive made AIC structures found throughout

17
00:01:03.171 --> 00:01:03.920
the world.

18
00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:08.450
Many of which are just as mysterious as they are massive as there is a huge

19
00:01:08.451 --> 00:01:10.730
missing chapter within our ancient history.

20
00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:15.370
In that we do not know exactly how or by who many of these structures were

21
00:01:15.371 --> 00:01:16.204
created.

22
00:01:16.550 --> 00:01:20.450
And I have received literally thousands of comments from people on various

23
00:01:20.710 --> 00:01:24.600
videos stating that structures were built by giants. Now,

24
00:01:24.601 --> 00:01:28.280
let me first say that I have always assumed that the various myths and legends

25
00:01:28.281 --> 00:01:32.600
of a race of giants existing on earth were simply exaggerated stories passed

26
00:01:32.601 --> 00:01:35.800
down over thousands of years. And I figured that, well,

27
00:01:35.980 --> 00:01:37.360
if giants actually did exist,

28
00:01:37.660 --> 00:01:40.680
we certainly would've found some skeletons and remains by now.

29
00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:45.550
And we haven't have, we I'll be discussing that later in this video.

30
00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:50.790
First let's acknowledge that there are indeed rare examples of people growing to

31
00:01:50.791 --> 00:01:52.630
be what many would consider to be a giant.

32
00:01:53.060 --> 00:01:57.350
Perhaps the most famous example is Andre. The giant who was seven foot,

33
00:01:57.380 --> 00:01:58.270
four inches tall,

34
00:01:58.330 --> 00:02:02.950
or 224 centimeters and weighed 520 pounds or,

35
00:02:03.300 --> 00:02:08.100
or 236 kilograms look at just how big he is compared to Muhammad

36
00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:10.220
Ali, who was nearly six foot four.

37
00:02:10.920 --> 00:02:15.700
And look at how big his fist is compared to Ali's head even compare his hand

38
00:02:15.840 --> 00:02:19.540
to a standard 12 ounce beer can isn't that just incredible?

39
00:02:20.360 --> 00:02:24.650
It seems to me that the word giant is a very appropriate to describe him,

40
00:02:24.870 --> 00:02:28.730
but it must be mentioned that he had a disorder of excessive growth hormone,

41
00:02:28.860 --> 00:02:33.410
which allowed him to grow so large and resulted in him dying of a heart attack.

42
00:02:33.411 --> 00:02:34.810
At 47 years of age,

43
00:02:35.230 --> 00:02:39.170
he grew too large for his heart to sustain him and ultimately passing away due

44
00:02:39.171 --> 00:02:42.370
to complications of what's called gigantic. In fact,

45
00:02:42.470 --> 00:02:46.640
the tallest human to ever have ex existed at least verified through irrefutable

46
00:02:46.840 --> 00:02:51.120
evidence is a man named Robert Wadlow who reached a height of eight feet,

47
00:02:51.220 --> 00:02:54.760
11 inches or 272 centimeters.

48
00:02:55.100 --> 00:02:58.680
And he was still growing up until he died at the early age of 22.

49
00:02:59.180 --> 00:03:02.160
He just like Andre. The giants also suffered from gigantic,

50
00:03:02.450 --> 00:03:07.320
which is caused by hyperplasia of the pituitary gland causing his abnormal and

51
00:03:07.321 --> 00:03:11.600
excessive growth, which also caused issues in his bones and joints. In fact,

52
00:03:11.900 --> 00:03:16.520
he needed braces for his legs just to walk and he ended up dying actually of an

53
00:03:16.521 --> 00:03:18.400
ankle infection in 1940,

54
00:03:19.370 --> 00:03:23.390
but neither of these examples are the results of being from a race of giants.

55
00:03:23.470 --> 00:03:23.711
I mean,

56
00:03:23.711 --> 00:03:27.910
they weren't so large because their parents were giants that gave birth to other

57
00:03:28.010 --> 00:03:28.690
giants.

58
00:03:28.690 --> 00:03:32.390
So is it possible that the various myths and legends of giants existing in the

59
00:03:32.391 --> 00:03:36.910
past are actually just similar examples to modern times were in certain rare

60
00:03:36.911 --> 00:03:38.910
examples, people grow to be exceptionally large.

61
00:03:40.020 --> 00:03:42.780
That's consider the biblical story of David V Goliath,

62
00:03:42.781 --> 00:03:46.380
which is also included in the Quran by the way, with different names,

63
00:03:46.930 --> 00:03:50.020
Goliath being JLU if I pronounce that correctly,

64
00:03:50.320 --> 00:03:54.060
but according to the king James version of the Bible Goliath's Heights,

65
00:03:54.061 --> 00:03:57.980
when converted to modern measurements would be nearly 10 feet tall,

66
00:03:58.670 --> 00:04:02.450
could this be an exaggerated figure for someone who is actually say between

67
00:04:02.460 --> 00:04:03.770
seven or eight feet tall?

68
00:04:04.650 --> 00:04:07.890
I speculate simply because I'm always reminded of the telephone game,

69
00:04:07.891 --> 00:04:12.410
which of course is a great way of portraying how information always changes when

70
00:04:12.411 --> 00:04:15.650
it's passed down through people over time and through different languages.

71
00:04:16.170 --> 00:04:16.931
I mean, think about it.

72
00:04:16.931 --> 00:04:20.280
If you pick out a current news story and then decide to go church,

73
00:04:20.281 --> 00:04:22.320
that story from three different news outlets,

74
00:04:22.620 --> 00:04:25.520
you're gonna get three different versions of the story every time,

75
00:04:25.521 --> 00:04:30.240
which is pretty odd considering it's 2018 and all of our technological abilities

76
00:04:30.340 --> 00:04:33.840
and abilities to well communicate information. And we still can't get things,

77
00:04:33.850 --> 00:04:34.500
right?

78
00:04:34.500 --> 00:04:38.160
So just compare the large discrepancy between the king James description of

79
00:04:38.230 --> 00:04:39.600
Goliath being nine feet,

80
00:04:39.601 --> 00:04:44.150
nine inches tall to the book of Enoch found within the dead sea scrolls,

81
00:04:44.151 --> 00:04:49.030
which states that Goliath was actually six feet, seven inches. Hmm.

82
00:04:49.031 --> 00:04:50.830
That is a large discrepancy.

83
00:04:50.930 --> 00:04:54.190
And I'll be discussing more about the dead sea scrolls in just a moment.

84
00:04:54.610 --> 00:04:58.510
But first it's worth mentioning that the six qubits and a span or the nine foot

85
00:04:58.511 --> 00:05:02.540
nine inch measurement comes specifically out out of the king James version of

86
00:05:02.541 --> 00:05:04.500
the Bible from the year 16, 11,

87
00:05:05.130 --> 00:05:08.980
just one small example of king James altering the Bible, which is of course,

88
00:05:09.100 --> 00:05:10.420
a very controversial subject,

89
00:05:11.090 --> 00:05:14.820
just like the many allegations that the Vaan had altered the Bible as well,

90
00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:19.340
but that's a topic for another video. So the story of Goliath aside,

91
00:05:19.510 --> 00:05:23.530
let's discuss the description of king IGA mesh of the ancient Sumerians,

92
00:05:24.070 --> 00:05:27.290
who has said to have reigned in power for 126 years.

93
00:05:27.291 --> 00:05:32.090
According to the Sumerian king list, he has said to have been 11 qubits tall,

94
00:05:32.140 --> 00:05:35.610
which is equivalent to 18 feet or five meters,

95
00:05:36.270 --> 00:05:39.930
it is even detailed that his punt poles used for moving and steering his boat

96
00:05:40.410 --> 00:05:41.890
where 60 qubits, long each,

97
00:05:42.130 --> 00:05:47.120
which is equivalent to 90 feet or 27 and a half meters look at these

98
00:05:47.121 --> 00:05:49.840
statues of king Giles holding a lion.

99
00:05:50.340 --> 00:05:52.760
And this has been depicted in many different statues.

100
00:05:53.540 --> 00:05:56.880
So is this a baby lion or is he a freaking giant?

101
00:05:57.700 --> 00:06:00.320
The lion appears to be male based on having its main,

102
00:06:00.321 --> 00:06:02.200
which would also make it an adult.

103
00:06:02.670 --> 00:06:05.880
Many people are not aware of just how big lions get. In fact,

104
00:06:05.881 --> 00:06:10.240
male African lions can exceed 500 pounds or 225 kilograms.

105
00:06:10.700 --> 00:06:12.880
And here are a few pictures for simple comparison,

106
00:06:13.260 --> 00:06:16.440
but it's really not until you're up close to one that you realize just how male

107
00:06:16.710 --> 00:06:17.750
as if they are, I mean,

108
00:06:17.840 --> 00:06:21.470
their backs are almost up to your chest and not to mention just how long their

109
00:06:21.630 --> 00:06:22.830
bodies are. Now.

110
00:06:22.831 --> 00:06:27.790
Obviously these statues do not mean that Gil mesh was actually a giant and you

111
00:06:27.791 --> 00:06:31.950
could easily infer that he raised lions and this is symbolic of him training

112
00:06:31.980 --> 00:06:34.670
them or taming them or controlling them who knows.

113
00:06:35.250 --> 00:06:39.260
But similar depictions are also shown in Sumerian clay tablets as well.

114
00:06:39.680 --> 00:06:40.780
And like I mentioned earlier,

115
00:06:40.960 --> 00:06:44.700
the Sumerian tablets and statues are from the earliest recorded human

116
00:06:44.740 --> 00:06:45.573
civilization,

117
00:06:46.120 --> 00:06:49.820
the earliest literature and the known existence of mankind details,

118
00:06:49.821 --> 00:06:52.940
the existence of a race of giants. And by the way,

119
00:06:52.941 --> 00:06:56.220
if you've seen my other videos, I do discuss other civilizations,

120
00:06:56.510 --> 00:06:58.930
which date back to tens of thousands of years earlier,

121
00:06:59.550 --> 00:07:02.810
I'm simply referring to documented civilization in this video,

122
00:07:03.070 --> 00:07:07.490
but some of these tablets show individuals that are much larger than others.

123
00:07:08.030 --> 00:07:11.490
And this is something that has also been depicted in Egyptian hieroglyphs as

124
00:07:11.491 --> 00:07:12.370
well. However,

125
00:07:12.440 --> 00:07:16.330
this has often been believed to be symbolism of differentiating people of power

126
00:07:16.430 --> 00:07:19.680
or royalty to everyone at else. So, like I mentioned,

127
00:07:19.681 --> 00:07:21.840
a few moments ago about the dead sea scrolls.

128
00:07:22.020 --> 00:07:26.520
It is really interesting to mention that a race of giants or the Neum who were

129
00:07:26.521 --> 00:07:30.280
discussed in the book of Enoch, which was included within the dead sea scrolls.

130
00:07:30.830 --> 00:07:33.240
I've mentioned these scrolls in other videos when mentioning the book of

131
00:07:33.241 --> 00:07:35.200
Watchers. But if you're not familiar,

132
00:07:35.330 --> 00:07:39.910
these scrolls were hidden inside caves located on the side of remote desert

133
00:07:40.050 --> 00:07:41.470
cliffs near the dead sea.

134
00:07:42.090 --> 00:07:45.470
And they were buried inside of seal jars for thousands of years.

135
00:07:46.090 --> 00:07:50.070
It really makes you wonder why someone or a group of people went to such an

136
00:07:50.071 --> 00:07:54.150
incredible extent to hide and preserve the information included in these

137
00:07:54.220 --> 00:07:55.990
scrolls. But let's be real.

138
00:07:56.210 --> 00:07:59.740
The fact that giants were written about on some scrolls thousands of years ago

139
00:08:00.040 --> 00:08:04.180
is not evidence that a race of giants actually existed and nor are the massive

140
00:08:04.260 --> 00:08:07.860
examples of megalithic structures from ancient times. For example,

141
00:08:07.960 --> 00:08:08.900
in my Petra video,

142
00:08:09.500 --> 00:08:13.180
I received hundreds of comments suggesting that the doors are so big because it

143
00:08:13.181 --> 00:08:15.340
was created and inhabited by giants.

144
00:08:16.050 --> 00:08:18.780
Look at the so-called monastery located at Petra.

145
00:08:19.010 --> 00:08:22.610
This is 150 feet tall or 46 meters.

146
00:08:23.310 --> 00:08:27.450
And I'm not exactly sure how tall the door is, but just compare it to people.

147
00:08:28.590 --> 00:08:31.410
Now look at this photo and in the top right corner,

148
00:08:31.840 --> 00:08:34.490
that is a man standing between those two circles.

149
00:08:35.230 --> 00:08:39.210
So why did they choose to make the structure so big and which, by the way,

150
00:08:39.430 --> 00:08:42.800
it was car of, out of the side of a mountain in the remote desert of Jordan.

151
00:08:43.350 --> 00:08:45.480
However, when you look at the so-called treasury,

152
00:08:45.490 --> 00:08:49.440
which is also located at Petra, you can see that despite the massive doorway,

153
00:08:50.100 --> 00:08:54.800
the steps are of normal size and another great example is that Eck in Lebanon,

154
00:08:55.840 --> 00:08:59.120
I received many comments from people suggesting that this site was created by

155
00:08:59.180 --> 00:09:03.120
giants and look at the size of the unbelievably large foundation stones at the

156
00:09:03.550 --> 00:09:06.680
HEOS and compare them to people standing nearby.

157
00:09:07.140 --> 00:09:11.120
And when you ascend into the Heliopolis look at the size that people compared to

158
00:09:11.121 --> 00:09:15.350
the temple Abacus simply massive, well look at the door,

159
00:09:15.900 --> 00:09:17.030
obviously that's amazing.

160
00:09:17.330 --> 00:09:19.990
But when you actually look at the steps you climb to reach it,

161
00:09:20.330 --> 00:09:22.270
you'll notice that they are of normal size.

162
00:09:22.490 --> 00:09:25.430
And it's the same when you enter inside the temple as well.

163
00:09:25.490 --> 00:09:28.390
And you can see there on the altar that the steps are, well,

164
00:09:28.470 --> 00:09:32.030
I would say standard size if this was indeed for giants,

165
00:09:32.410 --> 00:09:36.220
why are the steps so small in comparison? And of course,

166
00:09:36.370 --> 00:09:39.780
when you look at the steps that you climb up to at the temple of Jupiter,

167
00:09:39.781 --> 00:09:43.220
which is located right next to the temple of ACAS, I mean,

168
00:09:43.221 --> 00:09:44.900
if these were made for giants again,

169
00:09:45.240 --> 00:09:49.500
why are the steps so small and obviously of an appropriate size for humans

170
00:09:50.360 --> 00:09:50.901
now, of course,

171
00:09:50.901 --> 00:09:54.980
that does not mean that giants didn't build these sites for regular size people.

172
00:09:55.590 --> 00:09:57.490
But this of course brings us to the big question,

173
00:09:57.491 --> 00:10:01.370
which is that if a race of giants did exist, then where's all the evidence.

174
00:10:01.370 --> 00:10:05.050
Where's all the skeletal remains because it seems like we don't have bones,

175
00:10:05.051 --> 00:10:07.730
but we have a lot of tales and myths about it. I mean,

176
00:10:07.731 --> 00:10:09.850
we find so many dinosaur fossils yet.

177
00:10:09.851 --> 00:10:14.210
We haven't found any of human giants that would've been around far more recently

178
00:10:14.270 --> 00:10:15.103
in time.

179
00:10:15.270 --> 00:10:19.120
And this is where get to the conspiracy side of things where people suggest that

180
00:10:19.140 --> 00:10:19.940
no, wait a second.

181
00:10:19.940 --> 00:10:23.880
We have actually found many different skeletal remains of giants,

182
00:10:24.100 --> 00:10:26.480
but the evidence has been covered up and destroyed.

183
00:10:26.910 --> 00:10:30.040
This stems from many different news articles that were published in newspapers

184
00:10:30.150 --> 00:10:32.160
many years ago. Take for example,

185
00:10:32.220 --> 00:10:36.480
one that was published in the New York times from back in 1897 will,

186
00:10:36.870 --> 00:10:40.870
it's described a discovery of a human being over nine feet tall from head to

187
00:10:40.871 --> 00:10:44.150
foot. And the skull was described as being half a bushel,

188
00:10:44.280 --> 00:10:48.070
which correct me if I'm wrong would be something equivalent to around four

189
00:10:48.100 --> 00:10:49.190
gallons in size.

190
00:10:50.090 --> 00:10:54.030
The article goes on to describe that the skeleton was found along with other

191
00:10:54.050 --> 00:10:56.110
relics within a mound in Wisconsin.

192
00:10:57.280 --> 00:11:01.540
So one topic that I have not made a video on are the ancient mounds of north

193
00:11:01.541 --> 00:11:04.380
America, which many people do not even know exist.

194
00:11:04.600 --> 00:11:08.380
And I need to do more research on this topic before I make a video on it.

195
00:11:08.440 --> 00:11:12.380
But these mounds are scattered among many different states in north America,

196
00:11:12.381 --> 00:11:17.220
including Ohio, Mississippi, West Virginia, Tennessee, Louisiana,

197
00:11:17.810 --> 00:11:20.610
Oklahoma, Georgia, Illinois, and a few other states,

198
00:11:20.950 --> 00:11:24.810
and many people claim that these mounds are actually burial sites of giants.

199
00:11:24.870 --> 00:11:29.250
And the skeletons were removed in a coverup during excavations that were

200
00:11:29.251 --> 00:11:31.450
conducted well over a hundred years ago.

201
00:11:31.700 --> 00:11:35.490
There was actually another article in the New York times published in 1902

202
00:11:35.640 --> 00:11:39.920
reporting on an expedition of archeologists that had discovered a giant skeleton

203
00:11:40.060 --> 00:11:43.880
in New Mexico stating that it was 12 feet tall, which by the way,

204
00:11:43.881 --> 00:11:48.800
that's about 366 centimeters and had a forearm that was four feet

205
00:11:48.860 --> 00:11:52.080
in length and a well preserved lower jaw and teeth,

206
00:11:52.540 --> 00:11:56.520
get this teeth as large as the size of large walnuts.

207
00:11:57.220 --> 00:11:57.881
Not only that,

208
00:11:57.881 --> 00:12:02.480
but the chest was said to have a circumference of seven feet or 214

209
00:12:02.510 --> 00:12:05.720
centimeters. And this story was never heard of again,

210
00:12:06.340 --> 00:12:08.480
did anyone actually discover a 20 foot skeleton?

211
00:12:09.080 --> 00:12:11.240
I really can't find an answer about that at all,

212
00:12:11.380 --> 00:12:14.950
but you would assume it's not true. And these are just two articles.

213
00:12:15.130 --> 00:12:18.270
If you do a Google search for newspaper discoveries on giants,

214
00:12:18.570 --> 00:12:21.430
you'll find quite a few articles that day back more than a hundred years,

215
00:12:21.690 --> 00:12:24.190
all discussing the discovery of giants,

216
00:12:24.660 --> 00:12:27.750
even groups of 200 giant skeletons found in a cave,

217
00:12:28.170 --> 00:12:29.950
all of which exceeded nine feet tall.

218
00:12:30.610 --> 00:12:33.700
And here are a few examples of various newspaper articles from long ago,

219
00:12:33.701 --> 00:12:35.100
discussing similar fines.

220
00:12:35.480 --> 00:12:39.300
But there seems to be no way to verify if any of these discoveries were actually

221
00:12:39.410 --> 00:12:39.920
true.

222
00:12:39.920 --> 00:12:44.260
And these stories date back so long ago that nobody involved is alive today,

223
00:12:44.840 --> 00:12:48.100
but many people believe that due to the Smithsonians involvement in many of

224
00:12:48.101 --> 00:12:50.860
these excavations, particularly at the ancient mounds,

225
00:12:51.450 --> 00:12:54.850
that the evidence was suppressed from the is due to various reasons,

226
00:12:54.851 --> 00:12:55.850
including of course,

227
00:12:56.090 --> 00:12:59.650
religious implications and different rumors and theories have been developed

228
00:12:59.651 --> 00:13:00.484
over the years.

229
00:13:00.520 --> 00:13:03.930
Even stating that the Supreme court of the United States had ordered the

230
00:13:03.931 --> 00:13:07.730
Smithsonian to disclose their evidence. But according to Snopes,

231
00:13:07.731 --> 00:13:11.850
which I do not consider an authority on information anymore than I do Wikipedia,

232
00:13:11.851 --> 00:13:12.850
which by the way,

233
00:13:13.250 --> 00:13:17.040
I only show wi pious screenshots on my videos to show the viewer in a simple,

234
00:13:17.070 --> 00:13:21.760
easy way that the topic that I'm discussing is actually documented that said,

235
00:13:22.360 --> 00:13:23.960
Stoks declared this to be a false story.

236
00:13:24.180 --> 00:13:27.320
And that the Supreme court did not order the Smithsonian to do anything,

237
00:13:27.580 --> 00:13:30.760
but even if it were true that a race of giants had been discovered and that

238
00:13:30.761 --> 00:13:32.960
there was a coverup or the bones had been destroyed,

239
00:13:33.180 --> 00:13:35.430
we still should have found something. Now. I mean,

240
00:13:35.431 --> 00:13:38.990
random people have found dinosaur bones and the remains of wooly mammoths,

241
00:13:38.991 --> 00:13:42.270
whether it be construction crews, gold miners,

242
00:13:42.370 --> 00:13:44.470
people hiking on the beach or in the woods,

243
00:13:44.930 --> 00:13:47.550
random people have found these remains yet.

244
00:13:47.770 --> 00:13:50.470
We don't have people finding the remains of massive humans.

245
00:13:51.030 --> 00:13:54.230
I also believe that if giant fossils had been legitimately found,

246
00:13:54.610 --> 00:13:58.380
the evidence would be out by now because somebody would surely have taken the

247
00:13:58.381 --> 00:14:00.780
payday for those bones. I mean, holy crap,

248
00:14:00.920 --> 00:14:05.060
if someone actually found a 12 or a 15 foot tall skeleton of a human

249
00:14:05.690 --> 00:14:06.261
holy crap,

250
00:14:06.261 --> 00:14:10.180
would that be a game changer and would make somebody really freaking rich in the

251
00:14:10.181 --> 00:14:13.460
process too, because those bones would be worth millions of dollars.

252
00:14:14.280 --> 00:14:17.730
So surely someone would leak that information out by now. Right?

253
00:14:18.160 --> 00:14:21.690
What I can tell you is that there is a lot of fake crap out there on the

254
00:14:21.770 --> 00:14:23.690
internet involving the discovery of giants,

255
00:14:24.080 --> 00:14:26.770
many different CGI photos that are simply not real.

256
00:14:27.230 --> 00:14:30.130
And here are just a few examples that have been around the internet for years.

257
00:14:31.190 --> 00:14:33.610
One interesting story, which comes out of Egypt,

258
00:14:34.130 --> 00:14:35.970
involved the supposed finger of a giant,

259
00:14:36.210 --> 00:14:39.840
which measures 38 centimeters or 15 inches in length.

260
00:14:40.420 --> 00:14:44.760
And would've belonged to a human approximately five meters in height or 16 and a

261
00:14:44.920 --> 00:14:48.680
half feet tall. And these pictures were taken back in 1988.

262
00:14:49.060 --> 00:14:52.440
And apparently the man that had possession of the finger was offered money for

263
00:14:52.441 --> 00:14:55.960
it, which he refused. And then he vanished along with the finger.

264
00:14:56.070 --> 00:14:58.360
Neither one of them were ever seen or heard from again.

265
00:14:58.420 --> 00:15:01.320
And that was back in 1988. So if it was real,

266
00:15:01.380 --> 00:15:05.520
why didn't he submit it for testing? Well, that is, unless it actually was real.

267
00:15:05.580 --> 00:15:08.880
And the guy was, I don't know, murdered. And the finger taken from him,

268
00:15:09.470 --> 00:15:10.440
thus explaining why he,

269
00:15:10.570 --> 00:15:14.070
he and the alleged finger disappeared and have never been heard from since,

270
00:15:14.650 --> 00:15:19.190
but maybe it was just a total fake to begin with a notable example of a

271
00:15:19.191 --> 00:15:23.310
potential proof of a giant involves this footprint found in South Africa,

272
00:15:24.220 --> 00:15:26.270
long story short, Dr. Robert shock,

273
00:15:26.330 --> 00:15:29.310
who I admire and trust has examined the print.

274
00:15:29.490 --> 00:15:31.860
And he states that it's most like to be natural,

275
00:15:32.410 --> 00:15:36.220
just like the snowman shape figure located just a few feet, a few feet from it.

276
00:15:36.560 --> 00:15:39.300
And you could read the details on Dr. Shock's website,

277
00:15:39.360 --> 00:15:43.340
but it comes down to the incredibly high temperature in which granite is formed

278
00:15:43.400 --> 00:15:48.220
at shock believes that this is simply natural yet, obviously an unusual shape.

279
00:15:48.800 --> 00:15:53.450
And it of course could be fake as well. But this is a 3 billion year old stone.

280
00:15:53.550 --> 00:15:55.770
And it's obviously ridiculous to assume that someone,

281
00:15:55.771 --> 00:15:59.410
regardless of their size would step onto molten, magma, or lava.

282
00:15:59.750 --> 00:16:04.090
And obviously you must ask how someone could make a snowman type shape figure to

283
00:16:04.091 --> 00:16:04.930
go along with it.

284
00:16:05.100 --> 00:16:08.610
There have been other reasons why people have suggested that a race of giants

285
00:16:08.611 --> 00:16:12.320
existed including various large artifacts of axes or heads,

286
00:16:13.020 --> 00:16:16.360
but there could be so many different explanations for this such as art or

287
00:16:16.361 --> 00:16:20.160
decoration. Now, as I did more research on this topic for making this video,

288
00:16:20.300 --> 00:16:23.960
it became apparent that the information I've discussed so far is barely

289
00:16:23.961 --> 00:16:27.360
scratching the surface of all the information out there related to giants.

290
00:16:27.361 --> 00:16:28.760
In some way, for example,

291
00:16:28.761 --> 00:16:32.160
there were bones found referred to as the giants of castle. No,

292
00:16:32.161 --> 00:16:37.070
which allegedly is a skeleton that would've been 11 and a half feet or three and

293
00:16:37.071 --> 00:16:40.750
a half meters tall. So is this legitimate or not? I mean,

294
00:16:40.751 --> 00:16:41.670
if the bones were real,

295
00:16:41.671 --> 00:16:44.870
then why hasn't there been any type of modern day study to confirm it?

296
00:16:45.210 --> 00:16:46.630
Do you see what I'm saying? Now?

297
00:16:46.750 --> 00:16:49.190
I may make another video in the future on the topic of giants,

298
00:16:49.570 --> 00:16:53.820
but I ultimately need to see more evidence or legitimate evidence to we buy into

299
00:16:53.821 --> 00:16:55.220
it. But at the same time,

300
00:16:55.720 --> 00:16:59.500
I'm a very open-minded person and know that we are very ignorant to historical

301
00:16:59.501 --> 00:17:02.620
events in the past history of earth. So anything is possible.

302
00:17:02.920 --> 00:17:06.860
But my personal thoughts are that the myth and legends of giants actually

303
00:17:07.060 --> 00:17:11.580
referred to giants of mind that people of incredible intelligence lived long

304
00:17:11.680 --> 00:17:12.080
ago.

305
00:17:12.080 --> 00:17:15.730
And when you find various myth megalithic structures that were constructed in

306
00:17:15.800 --> 00:17:18.690
most likely pre Duluthian times in certain examples,

307
00:17:19.160 --> 00:17:23.690
more specifically before the younger dries climate catastrophe of 13,000 and

308
00:17:23.691 --> 00:17:28.450
11,600 years ago, perhaps in the several millennia following this event,

309
00:17:28.550 --> 00:17:32.730
as mankind made its rebound and stumbled upon various megalithic sites,

310
00:17:33.100 --> 00:17:36.160
maybe this is how the legend was developed. I mean,

311
00:17:36.161 --> 00:17:39.920
after all the true history of ancient human civilization is far older and

312
00:17:39.921 --> 00:17:41.520
advanced than what we were taught in school.

313
00:17:41.660 --> 00:17:45.240
And over the course of 12,000 years, since the climate catastrophe,

314
00:17:45.241 --> 00:17:49.560
that is way more than enough time to erase all the evidence, excluding.

315
00:17:49.560 --> 00:17:51.760
<v 1>That of megalithic stones. Ultimately,</v>

316
00:17:51.940 --> 00:17:55.040
it is interesting that so many different cultures from across multiple

317
00:17:55.041 --> 00:17:58.200
continents from around the world all share the same legends.

318
00:17:58.260 --> 00:18:01.800
So I look forward to reading comments that people leave as obviously I'm not

319
00:18:01.801 --> 00:18:04.680
including so many different things in this video because there's only so much

320
00:18:04.681 --> 00:18:07.200
time. So leave me a comment and share your thoughts,

321
00:18:07.201 --> 00:18:10.910
but I'm gonna close it up there. I'm Jimmy, this is bright insight,
