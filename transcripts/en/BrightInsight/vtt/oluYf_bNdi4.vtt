00:00:00.900 --> 00:00:03.400
<v 0>Hi everybody. I'm Jimmy, and this is bright insight.</v>

2
00:00:03.700 --> 00:00:07.640
So today I wanna talk with you about the unfinished Oly located in the Awan

3
00:00:07.700 --> 00:00:11.240
quarry in Egypt, more than 137 feet long.

4
00:00:11.380 --> 00:00:14.440
And if finished would've weighed at least 1200 tons,

5
00:00:14.900 --> 00:00:17.360
it would've been the world's largest OS by far.

6
00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:22.390
Now you may be familiar with other Olus most not the Washington monument located

7
00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:23.270
in Washington DC.

8
00:00:23.900 --> 00:00:25.750
<v 1>However, unlike the Washington monument,</v>

9
00:00:26.180 --> 00:00:29.070
this OSC is carved out of solid bedrock,

10
00:00:29.190 --> 00:00:32.830
particularly rose granite with a high concentration of quarts,

11
00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:37.110
which puts it at a seven outta 10 on the most scale of hardness, thus debunking,

12
00:00:37.111 --> 00:00:41.860
what modern Egyptologists claim were the tools utilized in order of this stone,

13
00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:43.660
for example, Doah right.

14
00:00:43.661 --> 00:00:47.780
Stone hammers and bronze chisels are what modern Egyptologists claim were

15
00:00:47.781 --> 00:00:52.100
utilized in order to carve this solid piece of bedrock into a nos. However,

16
00:00:52.300 --> 00:00:55.380
a significant amount of modern stone masons have claimed that well,

17
00:00:55.381 --> 00:00:56.214
that's just not possible.

18
00:00:56.780 --> 00:01:00.540
<v 0>And that it would essentially be like trying to cut and carve wood with another</v>

19
00:01:00.541 --> 00:01:02.450
piece of wood doesn't work like that.

20
00:01:03.310 --> 00:01:06.930
So the question becomes if Doright stone hammers and bronze chisels were not

21
00:01:06.931 --> 00:01:08.290
utilized to construct this project,

22
00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:11.810
then what would have been done when you look at these photos here,

23
00:01:11.811 --> 00:01:16.210
you can clearly see some sort of scoop marks with some sort of technology that

24
00:01:16.211 --> 00:01:17.730
we're not familiar with. However,

25
00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:21.850
it's very important to understand that this is solid bedrock, rose, granite,

26
00:01:22.060 --> 00:01:23.600
and that was ever utilized,

27
00:01:23.620 --> 00:01:28.520
had to have either been steel or some sort of sound resonating technology that

28
00:01:28.521 --> 00:01:31.240
we're just not familiar with today. In fact,

29
00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:34.760
I highly recommend that you check out Brian Forrester's YouTube channel or his

30
00:01:34.761 --> 00:01:39.320
website hidden incurs.com where many of these photos do originate from however I

31
00:01:39.321 --> 00:01:41.280
did source all these photos from Google images.

32
00:01:41.860 --> 00:01:46.710
Now he demonstrated that if they were utilizing bronze chisels in stone

33
00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:47.460
hammers,

34
00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:51.510
they couldn't possibly have made these types of incisions on the underbelly of

35
00:01:51.710 --> 00:01:53.430
this stone Oly. And in fact,

36
00:01:53.431 --> 00:01:56.750
you can clearly see in these photos that the angle would not have allowed anyone

37
00:01:56.890 --> 00:01:59.030
to make these type of cuts with those type of tools.

38
00:01:59.410 --> 00:02:01.990
And despite the fact that those tools weren't strong enough to do it in the

39
00:02:01.991 --> 00:02:06.620
first place I E the bronze chisels, clearly some other explanation is required.

40
00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:10.260
Now, the argument of how they cut, this is one thing ensure yes,

41
00:02:10.450 --> 00:02:14.540
it's possible that over time with enough people pounding stone hammers

42
00:02:15.270 --> 00:02:18.660
could have done some of this, I suppose. I think it's incredibly unlikely,

43
00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:21.980
but that's moved past the stone cutting part and discussed how they would've

44
00:02:21.981 --> 00:02:23.220
moved it. Now,

45
00:02:23.221 --> 00:02:27.850
one of the largest OLIS that was once in L Egypt is now at the Vatican.

46
00:02:27.851 --> 00:02:29.930
However, to move it in the 1930s,

47
00:02:29.931 --> 00:02:33.410
they had to take it apart into multiple pieces only to reconstruct it later.

48
00:02:34.070 --> 00:02:38.170
Now what's interesting about this is that it's original piece weighed at least

49
00:02:38.360 --> 00:02:40.210
455 tons,

50
00:02:40.780 --> 00:02:45.400
which having been moved from the S one Qury to luxury Egypt is more than

51
00:02:45.420 --> 00:02:48.600
252 kilometers or 156 miles.

52
00:02:50.300 --> 00:02:51.360
So the question becomes,

53
00:02:51.361 --> 00:02:55.600
how did they move something so massive case in point in 2012,

54
00:02:55.780 --> 00:03:00.040
the Los Angeles museum of the arts moved a 340 ton

55
00:03:00.490 --> 00:03:04.800
stone in order to be located at the museum. Now, this stone was moved, uh,

56
00:03:04.801 --> 00:03:08.240
over a hundred miles and it took 11 nights, but to do so,

57
00:03:08.241 --> 00:03:12.120
they had to custom order an Emer international truck that was

58
00:03:12.220 --> 00:03:15.960
295 feet long, 196 wheels,

59
00:03:16.360 --> 00:03:17.880
and more than 27 feet wide.

60
00:03:17.980 --> 00:03:22.110
And they had use a million different alternate routes because no overpasses or

61
00:03:22.111 --> 00:03:27.030
bridges could sustain the incredible amount of weight for this 340 ton stone.

62
00:03:27.730 --> 00:03:29.350
Now this 1200 ton Oly,

63
00:03:29.550 --> 00:03:33.270
although it wasn't completed and moved is three and a half times that weight.

64
00:03:33.890 --> 00:03:37.350
So when you consider the fact that one of these Oly was moved from the OS one co

65
00:03:37.450 --> 00:03:41.780
to Le Egypt, 156 miles away, how did they do that?

66
00:03:42.610 --> 00:03:44.940
Look, guys, I don't have all the answers in how they did this,

67
00:03:45.120 --> 00:03:48.740
but what I can tell you is what modern textbooks are still teaching in schools

68
00:03:48.790 --> 00:03:52.980
today is clearly inaccurate in that there's far more to the story than what we

69
00:03:52.981 --> 00:03:55.260
were taught in school. With all that being said,

70
00:03:55.420 --> 00:03:58.260
I highly recommend you research what modern masons are saying,

71
00:03:58.480 --> 00:04:00.050
how they demonstrated first hand,

72
00:04:00.051 --> 00:04:03.410
that bronze chisels couldn't possibly have cut this type of stone and that

73
00:04:03.840 --> 00:04:05.770
Doright stone hammers. I mean,

74
00:04:05.771 --> 00:04:09.330
you have to pound it for hours and hours just to create a few crumbs.

75
00:04:09.331 --> 00:04:11.410
It's pretty ridiculous. So with that being said,

76
00:04:11.660 --> 00:04:14.130
check out some of the research out there that's being conducted by Brian

77
00:04:14.131 --> 00:04:17.450
Forrester and many, many others. Anyways, guys, I'm Jimmy,

00:04:17.451 --> 00:04:20.880
this is bright insight. Leave a comment, let me know what your thought and like,
