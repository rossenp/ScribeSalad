00:00:00.470 --> 00:00:05.200
<v 0>What on earth is NASA management spending our billions of dollars in taxpayer</v>

2
00:00:05.201 --> 00:00:09.120
money on you may have seen the headlines go around the world this weekend on how

3
00:00:09.121 --> 00:00:13.240
NASA has once again, canceled another mission to go to the moon.

4
00:00:13.700 --> 00:00:16.680
And this of course involved the prospector Rover mission,

5
00:00:16.970 --> 00:00:21.790
which was gonna conduct experiments as a direct pre Herer to sending

6
00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:24.990
human beings to the moon. Once again, in this video,

7
00:00:25.150 --> 00:00:28.150
I have a few really interesting points to make about this situation.

8
00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:32.590
<v 1>And I'm also gonna share with you the actual person involved in NASA management,</v>

9
00:00:33.010 --> 00:00:35.350
who canceled this mission. Now, like I said,

10
00:00:35.500 --> 00:00:39.350
NASA scientists are absolutely shocked that this mission was canceled and they

11
00:00:39.351 --> 00:00:44.100
received no explanation as to why all they were told is that the same

12
00:00:44.110 --> 00:00:47.740
Rover and the instruments on it will be included on the next mission to go. So,

13
00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:48.530
oh, don't worry.

14
00:00:48.530 --> 00:00:49.420
<v 0>This will get done.</v>

15
00:00:49.730 --> 00:00:53.820
It's just that we don't have any type of future date or planning mission of any

16
00:00:53.821 --> 00:00:56.660
kind on when this will happen. And by the way,

17
00:00:56.661 --> 00:01:00.860
this is despite an order signed by president Donald Trump called the space

18
00:01:00.861 --> 00:01:05.170
policy to rect one, which involves sending humans back to the moon and to Mars.

19
00:01:05.470 --> 00:01:07.610
And regardless of what you think about president Trump,

20
00:01:07.720 --> 00:01:10.730
this is far more than the presidents have done over the last few decades.

21
00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:11.491
I mean,

22
00:01:11.491 --> 00:01:14.570
if you look at how president Obama canceled a mission to go back to the moon

23
00:01:14.571 --> 00:01:18.210
himself, he also canceled the space program in its entirety.

24
00:01:18.211 --> 00:01:21.970
As we now have no shuttle mission of any kind, but the,

25
00:01:22.240 --> 00:01:25.000
this isn't to blame any specific president, they're all involved. I mean,

26
00:01:25.001 --> 00:01:28.200
even look at president Bush before Obama, how in 2006,

27
00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:32.400
he did significant cuts to NASA, but he himself stated that don't worry.

28
00:01:32.430 --> 00:01:36.760
This is gonna help get humans back to the moon by 2018. Uh,

29
00:01:36.761 --> 00:01:39.920
and here we are in 2018 now canceling future missions,

30
00:01:39.921 --> 00:01:44.070
and we have no intention of any kind, no date, like I of going back to the moon.

31
00:01:44.570 --> 00:01:47.630
And this goes further back than president Bush, even look at president Clinton,

32
00:01:47.660 --> 00:01:51.830
look at the date on this 1995 and now Clinton reduced NASA's funding.

33
00:01:52.330 --> 00:01:54.790
And you can even find articles about this from 1981,

34
00:01:54.791 --> 00:01:58.230
going back to president Reagan, are you guys starting to see a pattern here? Oh,

35
00:01:58.231 --> 00:02:01.270
we're gonna go, we're gonna go. We're gonna go. And they just keep canceling it,

36
00:02:01.271 --> 00:02:02.430
canceling it and canceling it.

37
00:02:02.450 --> 00:02:07.260
And you here we are in 2018 and we have no dates or mission of any kind

38
00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:10.420
to send even a Rover to the fricking moon.

39
00:02:10.640 --> 00:02:13.940
And this is despite outstanding questions that still exist about our moon,

40
00:02:13.941 --> 00:02:17.260
including the origins of it and how just a year ago,

41
00:02:17.620 --> 00:02:21.180
scientists have discovered that the age of the moon is significantly older than

42
00:02:21.181 --> 00:02:24.610
they ever thought possibly older than our solar system itself.

43
00:02:25.110 --> 00:02:27.010
And you may have heard me discuss in other videos,

44
00:02:27.011 --> 00:02:29.010
other unusual things about our moon,

45
00:02:29.011 --> 00:02:33.530
such as the fact that they have discovered uranium 2 36 as well as neptunium

46
00:02:33.550 --> 00:02:36.730
2 37, which has never been found naturally on earth.

47
00:02:36.950 --> 00:02:39.010
So this of course raises many questions.

48
00:02:39.520 --> 00:02:42.970
Also the topic of lunar transient phenomena,

49
00:02:42.971 --> 00:02:45.360
which is something that most P people have never even heard of.

50
00:02:45.420 --> 00:02:47.160
And this dates back a couple thousand years,

51
00:02:47.190 --> 00:02:51.360
even where people have witnessed lights flashing on the moon of different

52
00:02:51.361 --> 00:02:55.920
colors, not just white, red, but also green. This photo right here,

53
00:02:55.921 --> 00:02:58.640
just so you know, is from Columbia university. In fact,

54
00:02:58.641 --> 00:03:03.000
this was even witnessed by the Apollo 11 astronauts on their way to land on the

55
00:03:03.001 --> 00:03:06.400
moon for the very first time. Basically what happened was back here on earth,

56
00:03:06.401 --> 00:03:07.400
through telescopes,

57
00:03:07.580 --> 00:03:11.760
we observed green fluorescent lighting on the moon as we were approaching it for

58
00:03:11.761 --> 00:03:14.480
landing. And when NASA called out to the astronauts,

59
00:03:14.481 --> 00:03:16.520
they got an immediate response from Michael Collins,

60
00:03:16.850 --> 00:03:19.270
indicating that they had seen this as well. Now,

61
00:03:19.271 --> 00:03:22.350
one explanation is that this could be volcanic activity of some kind,

62
00:03:22.410 --> 00:03:25.150
but it does raise questions on why green lights have been observed.

63
00:03:25.690 --> 00:03:28.230
But we do know that there is volcanic activity within,

64
00:03:28.231 --> 00:03:31.350
inside the moon and our seismographs that we have placed there have indicated

65
00:03:31.680 --> 00:03:35.750
moonquakes which raises many questions. I mean, is the moon not dead after all?

66
00:03:35.970 --> 00:03:39.340
And this of course ties into how so many people believe that we never went to

67
00:03:39.341 --> 00:03:39.901
the moon at all.

68
00:03:39.901 --> 00:03:42.540
And it's a pretty high percentage of people it's larger than most people

69
00:03:42.610 --> 00:03:43.443
realize.

70
00:03:43.600 --> 00:03:45.940
And this is something that I'll definitely have to make a video on in the

71
00:03:45.941 --> 00:03:46.400
future.

72
00:03:46.400 --> 00:03:50.020
I'm gonna have to spend some time doing a lot of research to really dig into it.

73
00:03:50.040 --> 00:03:52.260
People need to realize that not everything's black and white,

74
00:03:52.290 --> 00:03:54.780
it's not necessarily about have we been there? Have we not been there?

75
00:03:54.980 --> 00:03:57.580
I think the real questions are, what did we find there?

76
00:03:57.640 --> 00:04:00.170
And when is the last time we have been, I mean,

77
00:04:00.171 --> 00:04:02.130
there are some weird things about the Apollo missions.

78
00:04:02.131 --> 00:04:03.730
And although I think that we went to the moon,

79
00:04:04.270 --> 00:04:09.250
we have to ask ourselves why on earth did NASA delete the Apollo 11 tapes

80
00:04:09.251 --> 00:04:12.170
of its trajectory? And they said that back in the eighties, due to, uh,

81
00:04:12.171 --> 00:04:15.130
budget cuts, they had to essentially reuse the tapes, but it's like,

82
00:04:15.131 --> 00:04:15.964
wait a second.

83
00:04:16.470 --> 00:04:20.520
You deleted the Apollo 11 tapes on us going to,

84
00:04:20.521 --> 00:04:25.040
and from the moon, you couldn't find any other tape to delete. So you're like,

85
00:04:25.041 --> 00:04:25.560
okay,

86
00:04:25.560 --> 00:04:28.760
let's just delete the tapes of all the very first moon mission of people landing

87
00:04:28.761 --> 00:04:32.240
there ever. That doesn't really make sense. And when you also combine it,

88
00:04:32.241 --> 00:04:35.280
like I've discussed another videos, the Apollo 11 press conference,

89
00:04:35.281 --> 00:04:38.280
which was the most awkward thing you've ever seen in your life,

90
00:04:38.340 --> 00:04:40.160
go watch this on YouTube, by the way,

91
00:04:40.600 --> 00:04:45.150
where the astronauts were just man lead just seemed depressed and just not

92
00:04:45.151 --> 00:04:48.910
wanting to be there. It was the most UN enthusiastic thing I've ever seen.

93
00:04:49.330 --> 00:04:52.830
So let's get back to NASA management and how we're just not going back there

94
00:04:52.831 --> 00:04:55.750
because we could debate the moon missions to the blue in the face. And again,

95
00:04:55.751 --> 00:04:59.950
I'll make a video on that in the future, who is NASA management right now? Well,

96
00:04:59.951 --> 00:05:04.100
look at Jim Brennan and Stein who is appointed by president Trump and what I

97
00:05:04.101 --> 00:05:06.980
didn't realize by reading all these articles about this canceled Rover mission

98
00:05:07.040 --> 00:05:10.780
is that this guy just assumed office a week ago today,

99
00:05:13.100 --> 00:05:16.940
April 23rd, 2018. But yet when you look at when these articles came out,

100
00:05:16.941 --> 00:05:21.890
look at that April 27th. So this guy takes his position on the Monday.

101
00:05:22.550 --> 00:05:23.530
And then by Friday,

102
00:05:23.630 --> 00:05:26.810
the mission had been completely dumped and canceled his first week on the job,

103
00:05:27.220 --> 00:05:30.890
which I thought was incredible. And then I dug well a little bit deeper,

104
00:05:30.891 --> 00:05:31.890
and I discovered that, wait,

105
00:05:32.350 --> 00:05:35.650
the people on this mission with NASA were told on the 23rd,

106
00:05:36.040 --> 00:05:37.370
that the mission had been scrapped.

107
00:05:37.371 --> 00:05:40.210
And it wasn't until the 27th that the headlines and, you know,

108
00:05:40.211 --> 00:05:44.000
had made the news. So the, the very first day, this guy's on the job.

109
00:05:44.300 --> 00:05:49.200
And despite Trump signing a bill to instruct NASA to go put humans

110
00:05:49.300 --> 00:05:51.960
on the moon and all of a sudden he just scraps it entirely.

111
00:05:52.100 --> 00:05:56.120
And the scientists themselves weren't even given an explanation who is this guy?

112
00:05:56.121 --> 00:05:56.361
Well,

113
00:05:56.361 --> 00:06:00.480
it turns out that he's a politician and I had no idea that there was so much

114
00:06:00.481 --> 00:06:02.120
controversy when this guy came on board.

115
00:06:02.200 --> 00:06:03.600
I never even heard that he came on board,

116
00:06:04.180 --> 00:06:07.040
but people were griping about how well, yeah, he's a politician.

117
00:06:07.041 --> 00:06:10.320
And there was some interesting things that when they were overlooking his, uh,

118
00:06:10.321 --> 00:06:13.000
appointments, he had deleted his YouTube,

119
00:06:13.320 --> 00:06:16.440
Facebook and Twitter accounts all while he was being looked into. So this guy,

120
00:06:16.560 --> 00:06:18.150
shady president Trump,

121
00:06:18.250 --> 00:06:22.190
if you're the real deal wanting to send us back to the moon, fire this guy,

122
00:06:22.250 --> 00:06:25.390
or at least discuss publicly what the true intentions are,

123
00:06:25.391 --> 00:06:29.830
because why on earth that this guy canceled this mission his very first day on

124
00:06:29.831 --> 00:06:31.310
the job. Anyways, guys,

125
00:06:31.311 --> 00:06:33.790
leave me a comments and let me know what your thoughts are and all of this,

126
00:06:33.791 --> 00:06:36.670
and also hit the like button and subscribe. But I'm Jimmy,

127
00:06:36.671 --> 00:06:39.860
this is bright insight and I have many more videos to come and a whole wide

128
00:06:40.100 --> 00:06:41.900
radio topics take care of everybody.
