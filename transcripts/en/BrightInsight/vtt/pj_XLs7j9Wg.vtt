00:00:03.410 --> 00:00:08.350
<v 0>How is it possible to have existence from non-existence such as the big bang</v>

2
00:00:08.351 --> 00:00:12.630
theory, an explosion from nothing. Before I get into that,

3
00:00:12.631 --> 00:00:14.950
let me start off with a quote by the late Allen Watts.

4
00:00:15.980 --> 00:00:19.350
What you are basically deep, deep down far,

5
00:00:19.450 --> 00:00:23.980
far in is simply the fabric in structure of existence

6
00:00:24.040 --> 00:00:27.900
itself. Think about how deep that is. That means everything, your body,

7
00:00:28.090 --> 00:00:33.060
your house, the air, you breathe, your thoughts alone, your awareness,

8
00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:35.900
your free will are all part of the source.

9
00:00:36.010 --> 00:00:38.900
That existence itself is you your existence,

10
00:00:39.310 --> 00:00:43.380
which means that you are the universe you are of the source and getting away

11
00:00:43.381 --> 00:00:47.330
from religious beliefs. I mean, I say myself that I'm not religious,

12
00:00:47.490 --> 00:00:50.650
that nature's my church love is my religion. What is love?

13
00:00:50.651 --> 00:00:54.170
Where does that belong in this nihilistic view of something from nothing?

14
00:00:55.130 --> 00:00:57.330
I mean, I've heard some people say, oh, love is probably just,

15
00:00:57.360 --> 00:01:00.650
it's just a chemical reaction, that's it? Uh, no, uh,

16
00:01:00.651 --> 00:01:03.450
that doesn't fall in line with nature at all. It shouldn't. And if anything,

17
00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:05.760
you could say it slows down own nature and, uh,

18
00:01:05.761 --> 00:01:08.400
strongest survive in other things. And I've mentioned this in other videos.

19
00:01:08.950 --> 00:01:12.200
Another interesting thing to think about is our bodies.

20
00:01:12.410 --> 00:01:14.760
We're made up of dozens and dozens of elements.

21
00:01:14.980 --> 00:01:16.520
And I've talked about this in other videos,

22
00:01:16.521 --> 00:01:19.480
and I've got some real interesting responses. You know, I've said that,

23
00:01:19.481 --> 00:01:21.880
you know, we come from dirt, which I say is a figure of speech.

24
00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:23.880
And some people disagree. I didn't come from dirt. Well,

25
00:01:24.520 --> 00:01:28.510
actually the human body shares many different, uh,

26
00:01:28.511 --> 00:01:31.510
elements that you'll find in common soil. In fact, just to touch on this,

27
00:01:31.511 --> 00:01:34.390
if you haven't seen me talk about this in other videos, I mean,

28
00:01:34.391 --> 00:01:37.110
we're made up of so many different elements and this includes metals,

29
00:01:37.490 --> 00:01:42.230
our iron in our blood copper and cobalt in our bodies that you cannot be

30
00:01:42.231 --> 00:01:44.630
alive without. And although they're minuscule, you know,

31
00:01:44.631 --> 00:01:46.300
measured in parts per million, it's there,

32
00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:51.380
you wouldn't be alive without this smashed together infused system of energy

33
00:01:51.381 --> 00:01:52.940
and atoms. I mean,

34
00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:57.820
this energy that gives off life to the universe effortlessly and endlessly,

35
00:01:58.290 --> 00:02:02.420
that death implies life and life implies death. It's just a circle this cycle.

36
00:02:02.450 --> 00:02:07.170
It's amazing. And we get too caught up in death. And again,

37
00:02:07.230 --> 00:02:09.930
I'm not anti-science, I've said this before. Um, I mean,

38
00:02:09.970 --> 00:02:11.730
I think science is wrong about a number of things,

39
00:02:11.731 --> 00:02:15.090
just like we've been proven this throughout history that they're wrong and we

40
00:02:15.250 --> 00:02:16.650
learn new things all the time. That's great.

41
00:02:16.950 --> 00:02:19.130
And we're also right about a lot of things too. We've learned a lot,

42
00:02:19.910 --> 00:02:21.410
but when we get caught up in definitions,

43
00:02:21.430 --> 00:02:25.010
it distracts from the nature and the awesomeness of what we're experiencing guys

44
00:02:25.460 --> 00:02:30.320
think about this. How do you have nothing non-existence into existence?

45
00:02:30.500 --> 00:02:32.240
And this reminds me of a quote from the Dow day,

46
00:02:32.520 --> 00:02:34.960
Ching and I'll loosely paraphrase. It actually is what I'm gonna do.

47
00:02:35.680 --> 00:02:38.880
A Wiseman knows that there are limits to his knowledge that there are some

48
00:02:38.881 --> 00:02:42.160
things that you cannot know where a foolish man thinks. He knows everything.

49
00:02:43.240 --> 00:02:45.840
Wow. I mean, that is just absolute truth. There are, for some reason,

50
00:02:45.980 --> 00:02:48.990
the human brain cannot fathom this. Cuz think about it.

51
00:02:49.220 --> 00:02:51.670
Like if you want to talk about God for an example,

52
00:02:51.690 --> 00:02:53.990
and I don't like to use the word God, because a lot of people,

53
00:02:54.050 --> 00:02:57.310
too many people I'd say get caught up in this, uh, you know,

54
00:02:57.311 --> 00:03:00.400
figure in the sky with a beard floating in this clouds. And many,

55
00:03:00.590 --> 00:03:03.440
many other people don't feel that way. But I mean,

56
00:03:03.441 --> 00:03:07.040
this of course would raise the question. Okay, well what created God? Okay.

57
00:03:07.070 --> 00:03:10.040
Like it's this end endless cycle of, okay, if there's a big bang,

58
00:03:10.430 --> 00:03:14.440
then what's caused the big bang. What was the nature of that cause? Right.

59
00:03:14.580 --> 00:03:18.080
So it just keeps going forever and ever cuz what caused the cause or the ability

60
00:03:18.081 --> 00:03:21.910
to cause is the big bang total mind. Right? Like, excuse my language.

61
00:03:21.911 --> 00:03:24.470
But I mean ultimately when you think about it,

62
00:03:24.471 --> 00:03:28.550
it's clearly something we're not meant. We cannot know if you have the universe,

63
00:03:28.551 --> 00:03:32.910
which is made up of all this, this explosion of energy and here we are.

64
00:03:33.090 --> 00:03:36.990
And we're able to realize and think for ourselves that we do exist. I mean,

65
00:03:36.991 --> 00:03:39.740
when you troubleshoot it at its root core,

66
00:03:40.260 --> 00:03:43.620
I would say the most logical explanation besides the fact that we just can't

67
00:03:43.621 --> 00:03:47.900
understand it is that we're all part of this consciousness that is experiencing

68
00:03:47.960 --> 00:03:51.740
itself. Because when you think about the illusion of our lives, that this,

69
00:03:51.880 --> 00:03:54.780
we understand that we're a makeup of atoms and you're just this blob together.

70
00:03:54.780 --> 00:03:57.420
Like I said of energy, what is that about?

71
00:03:57.520 --> 00:04:00.530
So this actually ties me into simulation theory,

72
00:04:00.531 --> 00:04:04.450
which I don't exactly agree with because a lot of people get carried away with

73
00:04:04.451 --> 00:04:08.410
it. And it seems to exclude the loving nature of ourselves and that the actual

74
00:04:08.411 --> 00:04:09.250
experience we're having.

75
00:04:09.251 --> 00:04:12.690
Like I don't identify that we're part of some computer system that's plugged in

76
00:04:12.790 --> 00:04:16.930
and it takes away from love. I should say, which is this unexplainable,

77
00:04:17.900 --> 00:04:19.970
mysterious awesomeness. That to me,

78
00:04:20.060 --> 00:04:23.040
he proves the divineness of our existence.

79
00:04:23.960 --> 00:04:25.960
And when I say divineness that I would say that we're all it.

80
00:04:25.961 --> 00:04:29.480
So if you believe in a God, then you are God, I would say.

81
00:04:29.481 --> 00:04:32.440
And a lot of people when they hear that for the first time, they don't like it.

82
00:04:32.840 --> 00:04:35.760
I mean, think about it though. We can create languages.

83
00:04:35.761 --> 00:04:37.080
Like you can make your own language tomorrow.

84
00:04:37.080 --> 00:04:39.920
If you wanted to just assign different sounds to different meanings to the,

85
00:04:39.921 --> 00:04:40.754
you have a language,

86
00:04:41.330 --> 00:04:44.390
you can create a heaven or hell on earth experience for anyone,

87
00:04:44.490 --> 00:04:48.630
you can have a kid treat them really good or have a kid and treat them horribly,

88
00:04:48.631 --> 00:04:52.270
make their existence horrible. And vice versa. Think about this.

89
00:04:52.850 --> 00:04:55.510
We have free will and we have awareness of our free will.

90
00:04:56.410 --> 00:04:59.830
So when you really think about that, I would argue that we are all gods.

91
00:04:59.850 --> 00:05:01.740
I'm not saying we're the God. And again,

92
00:05:01.820 --> 00:05:04.100
a lot of people get caught up in that and they don't like hearing it,

93
00:05:04.101 --> 00:05:07.220
but I don't know if there's any other justifiable explanation for what we are.

94
00:05:07.680 --> 00:05:11.780
We are the universe experie experiencing itself. If you believe in the big bang.

95
00:05:12.020 --> 00:05:16.100
Well, you are the big bang just as Alan Watts has stated. Think about this guys.

96
00:05:16.101 --> 00:05:18.660
This is the biggest mind. you can possibly have.

97
00:05:19.140 --> 00:05:21.460
And I don't like to swear a lot, but for effect, you know,

98
00:05:21.760 --> 00:05:23.130
just how incredible this is.

99
00:05:23.131 --> 00:05:26.090
And I encourage everybody to dig into this for themselves and by dig into,

100
00:05:26.130 --> 00:05:27.850
I mean, think about it.

101
00:05:27.851 --> 00:05:31.370
Spend some quiet time thinking about what was there before time.

102
00:05:31.510 --> 00:05:35.210
How could there ever have been a non-existent time? I mean,

103
00:05:35.211 --> 00:05:38.050
there has to be a beginning, right? But at the same time,

104
00:05:38.440 --> 00:05:41.770
what created whatever it was, it created the beginning. So was there just,

105
00:05:42.080 --> 00:05:44.760
there was no beginning. I mean, I guess that's possible,

106
00:05:45.340 --> 00:05:48.480
but it's hard to wrap your mind about like, what is this about now?

107
00:05:48.481 --> 00:05:50.920
Ultimately the purpose of this video is to just get you thinking,

108
00:05:51.160 --> 00:05:53.880
cuz a lot of things I'm discussing here are gonna tie into other videos in the

109
00:05:53.881 --> 00:05:56.360
future. Guys. This is just the beginning of this channel.

110
00:05:56.720 --> 00:05:59.360
I discussed many different topics and I've been enjoying talking about ancient

111
00:05:59.361 --> 00:06:02.560
human civilization, which I will never stop doing that. I mean,

112
00:06:02.561 --> 00:06:04.560
it's a lifelong passion that is never going to end,

113
00:06:04.561 --> 00:06:06.440
but I'm gonna talk about many, many other different things.

114
00:06:06.441 --> 00:06:10.760
And one of which is the spiritual nature of our lives of our existence.

115
00:06:11.270 --> 00:06:15.400
It's worthy of far more attention because I'm telling you it's secure to so many

116
00:06:16.150 --> 00:06:20.270
ills of our lives, whether it's depression or lack of contentment in our lives,

117
00:06:20.271 --> 00:06:23.590
which is thriving, unfortunately for a lack of better word throughout the world,

118
00:06:24.170 --> 00:06:27.550
people are really starting to question what this is about because they're not

119
00:06:27.551 --> 00:06:31.710
living the lives that the field they are meant to. So I'm gonna wrap this up,

120
00:06:31.800 --> 00:06:34.390
leave me a comment. Let me know what your thoughts are.

121
00:06:34.410 --> 00:06:36.950
I'm a very open-minded person. I just wanna know the truth as,

122
00:06:37.220 --> 00:06:38.820
as I'm sure all of you do as well. I mean,

123
00:06:38.821 --> 00:06:42.060
if you put a button in front of me that says hit this and you get the truth,

124
00:06:42.061 --> 00:06:44.380
no matter what it is, no matter how bad it debunks everything,

125
00:06:44.420 --> 00:06:47.780
I thought I knew and shreds apart everything and makes me just feel dumb.

126
00:06:47.980 --> 00:06:51.740
I want to know boom, I'm pressing that button. Teach me. I wanna know.

127
00:06:51.800 --> 00:06:55.300
So one of the best ways to do that is for people to share thoughts and ideas.

128
00:06:55.301 --> 00:07:00.050
So leave a comment, explore us topic, but I'll leave it at that. I'm Jimmy,

129
00:07:00.080 --> 00:07:02.170
this is bright insight like and subscribe.

130
00:07:02.630 --> 00:07:05.650
And I have many other videos to come and a whole wide variety of topics.

131
00:07:05.880 --> 00:07:06.970
Take care, everybody. You.
