00:00:01.200 --> 00:00:06.090
<v 0>What you're about to see is approximately 12 minutes of virtually never</v>

2
00:00:06.091 --> 00:00:09.990
before seen video footage inside the bent pyramid of Egypt,

3
00:00:10.020 --> 00:00:14.160
which is among one of the most mysterious sites from ancient Egypt,

4
00:00:14.670 --> 00:00:18.450
as it's been closed off to the public for more than 50 years. In fact,

5
00:00:18.451 --> 00:00:22.080
because of that, even researchers and notable Egyptologists,

6
00:00:22.081 --> 00:00:26.760
such as the late and legendary John Anthony West himself never had the

7
00:00:26.761 --> 00:00:30.990
opportunity to enter the bent pyramid, which was one of his long-time wishes.

8
00:00:31.590 --> 00:00:36.090
However, the bent pyramid just reopened to the public in June of 2019.

9
00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:40.500
<v 7>And I was fortunate enough to be in Egypt this last November in December of</v>

10
00:00:40.501 --> 00:00:43.170
2020. And on November 30th,

11
00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:46.620
I had the privilege of going into the bent pyramid with Ben of the awesome

12
00:00:46.621 --> 00:00:48.060
channel unchartered X,

13
00:00:48.630 --> 00:00:51.870
along with Yusuf Yon from the chemist school of ancient mysticism.

14
00:00:52.470 --> 00:00:55.080
And I took my, I felt my iPhone 12 pro,

15
00:00:55.440 --> 00:00:59.130
and I have approximately 12 minutes of outstanding footage for you.

16
00:00:59.130 --> 00:01:00.600
<v 0>Now, before I play the clip,</v>

17
00:01:00.601 --> 00:01:03.480
just keep in mind that this starts off at the tunnel entrance,

18
00:01:03.481 --> 00:01:07.170
which is somewhere between 40 and 50 feet off the ground. In fact,

19
00:01:07.171 --> 00:01:10.650
an entire staircase had to be constructed just to get up there.

20
00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:15.000
And the tunnel shaft itself is three feet wide and three feet tall.

21
00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:17.460
I was literally squatting the entire way down,

22
00:01:17.461 --> 00:01:20.040
which was a leg workout to say the least,

23
00:01:20.041 --> 00:01:21.420
and they make jokes on it in the video,

24
00:01:21.421 --> 00:01:24.330
but I'm going to play the video clip and I'm going to make a comment and then

25
00:01:24.331 --> 00:01:28.440
show you another shorter clip. So without further ado, here we go.

26
00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:30.330
<v 1>Let's do a quick little</v>

27
00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:34.530
frame of reference at the bent pyramid.

28
00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:45.630
Holy. Yeah, this is, this is cramps.

29
00:01:48.150 --> 00:01:51.780
I am bent more than halfway over. This is unreal.

30
00:01:53.430 --> 00:01:54.420
It's this little thing here.

31
00:01:58.410 --> 00:02:02.820
Yeah, this is no joke. Yeah. It's

32
00:02:08.430 --> 00:02:10.170
wow. I think the roof a few times already,

33
00:02:11.150 --> 00:02:15.360
and this is 80 something meters that lead 87 meters tunnel.

34
00:02:24.300 --> 00:02:27.180
Now, if you look at the sides, the precision,

35
00:02:30.840 --> 00:02:35.520
see the blocks. This is next level paint on the construction tunnel

36
00:02:37.150 --> 00:02:40.710
car through these rocks of it looks like that rock. I don't know.

37
00:02:43.230 --> 00:02:47.190
I'll shut up because I always know. I know we'll narrate. We'll filming.

38
00:02:48.360 --> 00:02:51.540
I just want to see, oh my God, this is nuts.

39
00:02:58.650 --> 00:03:03.640
Good. I'm at the halfway mark. Feel it in the legs.

40
00:03:06.550 --> 00:03:11.080
Look at this. We in the bedrock yet. I don't even know where exactly situated.

41
00:03:21.670 --> 00:03:22.503
<v 2>[Inaudible].</v>

42
00:03:22.870 --> 00:03:25.930
<v 1>I'm mean look at this. You got that. The lines.</v>

43
00:03:28.060 --> 00:03:31.720
So yeah, this is look at the, just take a second to see the precision.

44
00:03:32.440 --> 00:03:36.880
So I'm walking through a tunnel of a bunch of fricking huge stones that are

45
00:03:36.881 --> 00:03:37.714
pieced together

46
00:03:44.890 --> 00:03:45.723
Late day, bruh.

47
00:03:49.940 --> 00:03:53.680
Oh, holy. Oh my God.

48
00:03:55.990 --> 00:03:56.830
Leg day, bro.

49
00:03:59.770 --> 00:04:00.603
<v 3>Well.</v>

50
00:04:04.570 --> 00:04:07.030
<v 1>87 Meters or 86 or whatever.</v>

51
00:04:13.450 --> 00:04:14.283
Oh, wow.

52
00:04:30.820 --> 00:04:31.600
<v 3>[Inaudible].</v>

53
00:04:31.600 --> 00:04:33.370
<v 1>Oh my God. Look at this.</v>

54
00:04:37.050 --> 00:04:38.380
This is one steep.

55
00:04:49.820 --> 00:04:50.653
<v 3>[Inaudible].</v>

56
00:04:51.460 --> 00:04:55.330
<v 1>We're like 80 or 90. And then the walls.</v>

57
00:04:56.640 --> 00:05:00.820
Look at this. Look at this precision just for.

58
00:05:06.310 --> 00:05:07.143
<v 3>[Inaudible].</v>

59
00:05:07.960 --> 00:05:12.430
<v 1>Second to me, but that was my hotel room key. Hold on.</v>

60
00:05:12.431 --> 00:05:16.030
Let me show you. I want to be careful what I take out

61
00:05:18.370 --> 00:05:21.490
my driver's license for perspective.

62
00:05:26.230 --> 00:05:29.560
Yeah, look at this. I'll just

63
00:05:31.210 --> 00:05:32.980
block after block, after block.

64
00:05:41.860 --> 00:05:42.460
<v 3>[Inaudible].</v>

65
00:05:42.460 --> 00:05:44.260
<v 1>And then this is like, let me count the stories.</v>

66
00:05:44.261 --> 00:05:47.890
1, 2, 3, 4.

67
00:05:48.220 --> 00:05:50.260
I think that's five or six levels.

68
00:05:58.310 --> 00:06:00.140
Yeah, it looks like five here.

69
00:06:08.660 --> 00:06:10.810
Let's keep filming. I'm going up. Bring that guitar.

70
00:06:20.900 --> 00:06:21.770
Just tell them the whole thing.

71
00:06:26.120 --> 00:06:26.953
If I squeeze my,

72
00:06:31.220 --> 00:06:34.820
Hey, catch my phone real quick. I want the shot of it recording as it falls.

73
00:06:38.150 --> 00:06:41.690
And let's just take a look. So here you got the, oh wow.

74
00:06:43.490 --> 00:06:45.620
The phone's picking up the way I see it. This is not

75
00:06:47.870 --> 00:06:52.870
block after block piece together where this pyramid,

76
00:06:52.920 --> 00:06:55.550
the bend pyramid just opened in 2019.

77
00:06:55.551 --> 00:06:59.870
I believe in June after something like 20 years

78
00:07:00.560 --> 00:07:01.371
of restoration,

79
00:07:01.371 --> 00:07:05.390
which is funny because in modern times it takes us 20 years to restore something

80
00:07:06.140 --> 00:07:10.670
that was said to be constructed in 20 something years in the ancient of times.

81
00:07:12.320 --> 00:07:17.240
Think about that. See guys, this isn't, this isn't a tomb.

82
00:07:17.260 --> 00:07:18.860
You see the design of all this and we're up.

83
00:07:19.250 --> 00:07:24.110
So I'm on the fifth floor right now. Let me look down. Zoom in.

84
00:07:24.111 --> 00:07:26.570
You see like below me, they're like,

85
00:07:26.720 --> 00:07:31.100
it's like at least 60 feet and I look up. So we're at like up here.

86
00:07:31.101 --> 00:07:33.020
It's at least 60, 70 feet. I don't know.

87
00:07:33.050 --> 00:07:37.340
It was a guess maybe 80 and just the nature

88
00:07:39.230 --> 00:07:43.460
of the layout. All right. So going at these blocks,

89
00:07:45.950 --> 00:07:48.230
stacked in, look at this tunnel.

90
00:07:51.860 --> 00:07:53.630
I hit my back. I'll live.

91
00:07:55.160 --> 00:07:59.120
<v 4>Um, I'm totally post this on Insta their mind if I squeeze through real quick.</v>

92
00:08:00.230 --> 00:08:01.063
Yes.

93
00:08:04.760 --> 00:08:08.630
Mind if I squeeze through please. Jimmy, Jimmy,

94
00:08:09.770 --> 00:08:14.270
me. I keep it in my back. This is great wagon behind. Wow.

95
00:08:14.720 --> 00:08:17.390
Is there a remnant fit through or no? You're going to have to,

96
00:08:18.500 --> 00:08:19.333
it's not that far.

97
00:08:22.520 --> 00:08:26.120
I'm doing a full video tour. Yeah. You're on camera then. Uncharted X.

98
00:08:26.660 --> 00:08:28.340
How is it in there? Wonderful.

99
00:08:28.580 --> 00:08:31.340
<v 5>Yeah, it was a couple of features. The, uh, you see the, the breeze up there.</v>

100
00:08:31.341 --> 00:08:35.750
There's a stone sledge to the right that used to block that Western entrance

101
00:08:36.590 --> 00:08:37.970
color stone. And then you'd go up to the back.

102
00:08:38.030 --> 00:08:41.660
<v 4>Okay. I can't wait to see what a bat cave looks like. Just maybe let.</v>

103
00:08:41.870 --> 00:08:44.360
<v 5>Can we tell people back there there's two people coming up.</v>

104
00:08:46.430 --> 00:08:49.190
<v 4>I would love to get these fly by now. I can see. Oh yeah,</v>

105
00:08:51.880 --> 00:08:54.860
yeah. Yeah. Tons of.

106
00:08:56.430 --> 00:09:01.080
<v 1>Thanks. Janna. Oh yeah. It's a little dark. So many buttons.</v>

107
00:09:02.040 --> 00:09:07.020
Like there really is bats in here. They're going on Institute.

108
00:09:09.480 --> 00:09:12.960
Jesus Christ. This is amazing. Hey, what's going on doc?

109
00:09:14.190 --> 00:09:19.020
And it goes this way. It goes this way, Sheila.

110
00:09:19.050 --> 00:09:23.910
How are you? It's nice in here. Isn't it? Ooh, Todd, how is it?

111
00:09:25.020 --> 00:09:25.853
And where would this go?

112
00:09:27.600 --> 00:09:30.240
Ear flow chamber out to the Western Western,

113
00:09:31.110 --> 00:09:34.320
outside of the pyramid for the air flows coming from it. Hold on.

114
00:09:34.321 --> 00:09:35.610
I know this is shaky camera stuff,

115
00:09:35.611 --> 00:09:38.700
but I don't want to stop recording simply because I want everyone to see the

116
00:09:38.701 --> 00:09:39.570
tour of this place.

117
00:09:43.260 --> 00:09:46.020
Give me get a flashlight out.

118
00:09:47.730 --> 00:09:51.000
My friend, Ben from Australia, calls it a torch,

119
00:09:51.930 --> 00:09:54.930
I think is great. This stuff. Second guys.

120
00:09:56.610 --> 00:09:58.470
This wasn't anticipating cleaners cramps.

121
00:10:04.200 --> 00:10:08.640
I didn't ask me your first name. David Connie.

122
00:10:10.260 --> 00:10:11.550
What am I looking at here?

123
00:10:12.630 --> 00:10:17.340
I would like to know where that all goes and it goes up. That's weird.

124
00:10:18.270 --> 00:10:22.830
These are obviously more modern cuts. Okay.

125
00:10:23.520 --> 00:10:27.120
So we're going to go down here and look at this.

126
00:10:27.121 --> 00:10:32.040
So I'm in another tunnel with this incredible precision of cut

127
00:10:32.050 --> 00:10:36.120
blocks and I am a few hundred feet up off the ground.

128
00:10:36.960 --> 00:10:39.240
Oh, well actually, no, I don't know that because we went down for a while.

129
00:10:39.241 --> 00:10:40.170
Then we went back up.

130
00:10:40.650 --> 00:10:45.060
So I'm probably around the same level that I was at with the stairs.

131
00:10:45.061 --> 00:10:47.790
I don't know. I'm just blabbing. Oh, okay. There's some bats.

132
00:10:48.420 --> 00:10:52.470
You probably can't see them, but they are there. Those are bats.

133
00:10:53.160 --> 00:10:58.080
That's a big bat. Oh wow. Oh wait. Maybe it's not,

134
00:10:58.110 --> 00:11:00.600
there are bats that one's not as bad, but there was events

135
00:11:02.940 --> 00:11:07.920
up here. Like what is this? This is nothing about, this is like a tomb.

136
00:11:07.921 --> 00:11:10.320
This is not burial site. It really is.

137
00:11:10.321 --> 00:11:12.990
And you guys have heard me talk about that a million times, but look,

138
00:11:12.991 --> 00:11:14.760
and thanks for yourselves. Like, oh yeah,

139
00:11:14.880 --> 00:11:17.280
this is just the layout of where you bury someone and oh,

140
00:11:17.281 --> 00:11:22.260
of course we never found a mummy whatsoever in any of these tunes, but you know,

141
00:11:23.170 --> 00:11:25.380
where does this go under the stairs. Okay.

142
00:11:25.381 --> 00:11:28.140
Now that's kind of weird smelling urine. That's got to be bat.

143
00:11:29.430 --> 00:11:30.540
I've been to a zoo before.

144
00:11:38.370 --> 00:11:39.203
<v 6>Well</v>

145
00:11:40.050 --> 00:11:44.700
have these lots of woop and then these small pieces of stone, Mr.

146
00:11:47.760 --> 00:11:48.780
[inaudible] love.

147
00:11:56.130 --> 00:11:59.230
And it's what supported this is. And this is ours.

148
00:12:00.190 --> 00:12:04.660
So say a little bit once here, take these locks.

149
00:12:05.050 --> 00:12:07.660
We got them, but they were really dated the side.

150
00:12:13.810 --> 00:12:14.440
[inaudible].

151
00:12:14.440 --> 00:12:17.470
<v 0>Now that's where the camera cuts off because it was a little crowded and loud in</v>

152
00:12:17.471 --> 00:12:20.710
there. But I have another minute long clip, which I started playing.

153
00:12:20.711 --> 00:12:23.170
When I went back down that five level stairwell,

154
00:12:23.320 --> 00:12:25.660
which will give you a different perspective of what I saw.

155
00:12:25.661 --> 00:12:29.140
So let me show that to you now. So that's the chamber. We were just in,

156
00:12:29.650 --> 00:12:33.220
it goes all the way to the top as we were just up there,

157
00:12:33.610 --> 00:12:38.320
way up there. And then we go down this steep set of steps,

158
00:12:38.321 --> 00:12:41.410
which aren't even supposed to be there. Cause it's all Hollis.

159
00:12:41.411 --> 00:12:43.960
And they keep that in mind. There are no steps here.

160
00:12:43.961 --> 00:12:46.630
And when you see these steps, this is the tunnel I went down in originally.

161
00:12:47.260 --> 00:12:52.000
And that's on the way out. Yeah.

162
00:12:52.150 --> 00:12:52.983
Up and out.

163
00:12:52.990 --> 00:12:57.640
And so nothing about this is meant for humans to be able to move

164
00:12:57.641 --> 00:13:02.440
around in. There's no steps. There's no nothing without us putting it in there.

165
00:13:02.920 --> 00:13:07.780
It just goes up. This isn't amazed in order to keep two robbers out.

166
00:13:07.840 --> 00:13:11.440
Nevermind. The fact that there was no money found in here. It's just something,

167
00:13:12.130 --> 00:13:15.280
it seems functional. So leg day, bruh,

168
00:13:16.540 --> 00:13:19.030
is it just me or is that place absolutely incredible.

169
00:13:19.031 --> 00:13:23.590
And was it like anything you expected it to look like and you got to keep in

170
00:13:23.591 --> 00:13:24.100
mind,

171
00:13:24.100 --> 00:13:28.360
we're seeing it as it is today with all these stairwells that were built into it

172
00:13:28.930 --> 00:13:31.510
and keep in mind that people have been going through,

173
00:13:32.020 --> 00:13:33.970
they're doing whatever humans do,

174
00:13:34.000 --> 00:13:37.570
beaten up the place for the last hundreds and even thousands of years.

175
00:13:37.900 --> 00:13:41.380
Keep in mind when you saw that chamber in there, the King's chamber,

176
00:13:41.381 --> 00:13:45.490
which I never was found with any mummy or Saghafi I guys that wasn't there.

177
00:13:45.790 --> 00:13:49.600
So that whole roof system that you see busted and the logs laying across it,

178
00:13:50.320 --> 00:13:54.820
that was a sealed chamber. So who knows exactly what has taken place in there.

179
00:13:54.910 --> 00:13:57.700
And, and of course they also use explosives in there too. I mean,

180
00:13:57.701 --> 00:13:58.780
the place was wrecked.

181
00:13:59.200 --> 00:14:03.100
So we have no idea what truly happened there or what its original originality

182
00:14:03.340 --> 00:14:03.640
looked like.

183
00:14:03.640 --> 00:14:08.140
But I will say this pictured in your mind without all those stairs and

184
00:14:08.141 --> 00:14:12.490
explain how it would make sense for that to be a tomb for anybody managing,

185
00:14:12.491 --> 00:14:17.200
moving a mummy and our Sakara guy up where there are no stairs into that tunnel

186
00:14:17.201 --> 00:14:19.600
that goes in. I mean, something I'm just going to say it.

187
00:14:19.960 --> 00:14:22.930
I do not believe for a second that that was built with the purpose of being a

188
00:14:23.110 --> 00:14:25.540
tomb for the pharaohs. I think it's a silly idea.

189
00:14:25.840 --> 00:14:29.380
It's not backed by hardly any evidence at all. And not only that,

190
00:14:29.410 --> 00:14:32.470
that theory didn't even exist in Egypt to about 150,

191
00:14:32.471 --> 00:14:37.390
160 years ago when a bunch of outsiders from other countries invaders

192
00:14:37.510 --> 00:14:39.580
came in and said, that's what it is.

193
00:14:40.060 --> 00:14:42.310
A lot of people don't realize that the Egyptians themselves,

194
00:14:42.311 --> 00:14:44.830
the locals populous don't believe that they were meant to be teams for the

195
00:14:45.160 --> 00:14:48.040
pharaohs or at least not many of them. So these are details.

196
00:14:48.041 --> 00:14:51.040
A lot of people aren't aware of, but let me also say this.

197
00:14:51.410 --> 00:14:55.160
I took several hundred photos on my outstanding mirrorless camera.

198
00:14:55.580 --> 00:14:59.240
So you haven't seen any of that yet because right now I'm not filming this on my

199
00:14:59.241 --> 00:15:02.690
typical setup because I'm traveling. I'll share more about that in a second.

200
00:15:03.140 --> 00:15:07.940
So I will be making a full peer or a video about the bent pyramid

201
00:15:07.970 --> 00:15:10.790
in the future. We'll explain all the different details about it.

202
00:15:11.300 --> 00:15:15.410
And also mentioned the fact that the very nature itself of being bent and how

203
00:15:15.530 --> 00:15:18.530
will these so-called experts claim that that was just an accident on behalf of

204
00:15:18.531 --> 00:15:19.040
the Egyptians.

205
00:15:19.040 --> 00:15:23.510
Like no guys that's stupid Egypt didn't make mistakes like that and they could

206
00:15:23.570 --> 00:15:26.930
have fixed it. I believe that this thing was functional.

207
00:15:27.440 --> 00:15:30.890
I think it had something to do with frequency and vibration,

208
00:15:31.040 --> 00:15:33.110
probably channeled water and air through it.

209
00:15:33.410 --> 00:15:35.570
I'm not trying to convince you that. I don't know that,

210
00:15:36.170 --> 00:15:40.880
but I think this is beyond our level of understanding and maybe just maybe some

211
00:15:40.881 --> 00:15:43.940
really impressive things were happening here on earth, in the distant past.

212
00:15:44.450 --> 00:15:49.190
And now it's fricking gone guys. So stay tuned to a future video on that.

213
00:15:49.220 --> 00:15:53.360
And let me just say that I'm going to be posting another video of raw unedited

214
00:15:53.361 --> 00:15:57.020
footage of being inside the second pyramid, the so-called pyramid of coffee,

215
00:15:57.021 --> 00:16:01.610
which wasn't his pyramid either. Uh, and that goes from the Sphinx,

216
00:16:01.760 --> 00:16:03.590
the Causeway up to the second pyramid.

217
00:16:03.591 --> 00:16:07.010
And let me just say that I have significant reason to believe that that pyramid

218
00:16:07.011 --> 00:16:09.350
was built before the great pyramid of Giza,

219
00:16:09.351 --> 00:16:12.170
which I originally thought that was the first one and the most impressive,

220
00:16:12.200 --> 00:16:15.020
but Ben from unchartered X sold me otherwise.

221
00:16:15.020 --> 00:16:16.940
And I think that there's some real truth to that,

222
00:16:17.180 --> 00:16:20.120
that the second pyramid was the first, because so many things about it,

223
00:16:20.210 --> 00:16:23.570
or even more impressive in the great pyramid and these are details I never knew

224
00:16:23.571 --> 00:16:26.120
about. So I went and saw it with my own eyes. So look forward to that.

225
00:16:26.870 --> 00:16:29.900
But I also say this when I say that I'm not on my current setup.

226
00:16:29.930 --> 00:16:32.270
So if you watched my recent live stream video,

227
00:16:32.271 --> 00:16:35.750
I mentioned that I'd have some details to share in the, in the future.

228
00:16:35.751 --> 00:16:37.130
And so I'll share it now.

229
00:16:37.550 --> 00:16:40.160
I've been living in Boise for the last four and a half years,

230
00:16:40.161 --> 00:16:41.390
although I'm in Arizona right now,

231
00:16:41.391 --> 00:16:44.450
as I film this and I'm moving back to Arizona,

232
00:16:44.750 --> 00:16:48.170
I'm going to be going back to Idaho soon to finish things up there, uh,

233
00:16:48.200 --> 00:16:49.010
complete the move,

234
00:16:49.010 --> 00:16:53.030
but I couldn't be more excited to be making this move to be closer with family

235
00:16:53.031 --> 00:16:53.600
and friends.

236
00:16:53.600 --> 00:16:57.260
And it's just going to help Jimmy to be able to make videos on a more regular

237
00:16:57.261 --> 00:17:00.050
basis. That'll have other things around in my life that are necessary.

238
00:17:00.051 --> 00:17:03.860
So Idaho's wonderful. I recommend Boise to other people,

239
00:17:04.190 --> 00:17:07.610
but uh, it's time for Jimmy to, uh, move on. And yeah,

240
00:17:07.611 --> 00:17:11.600
I love talking to third person, but anyways, but yeah, so stay tuned.

241
00:17:11.601 --> 00:17:12.890
Once I have my full set up here,

242
00:17:12.891 --> 00:17:15.590
I'll be able to start making video presentations with all the pictures and

243
00:17:15.591 --> 00:17:19.400
slides like I typically do. So I can explain things in more detail,

244
00:17:19.410 --> 00:17:23.750
but it is fun sharing these unedited videos through my iPhone,

245
00:17:23.751 --> 00:17:27.590
which I thought took some pretty good quality shots. So anyways,

246
00:17:27.800 --> 00:17:30.800
leave a comment. Let me know what your thoughts are and all of this. I mean,

247
00:17:30.801 --> 00:17:31.634
again,

248
00:17:31.790 --> 00:17:36.620
picture this bent pyramid and the entrance itself being 40 50 may have been 60

249
00:17:36.621 --> 00:17:40.490
feet, but I want to say 40, 50 feet off the ground that staircase didn't exist.

250
00:17:40.580 --> 00:17:42.830
It's flat with all the casing stones.

251
00:17:43.040 --> 00:17:46.370
So to get up there in the first place is something else. Um,

252
00:17:46.610 --> 00:17:50.760
and the very nature about it. What do you guys think this was? I mean,

253
00:17:50.790 --> 00:17:53.160
it's all about having ideas and thinking for yourself.

254
00:17:53.161 --> 00:17:56.250
And if there's one thing I always say on this channel is to think for yourself.

255
00:17:56.280 --> 00:18:00.060
But anyways guys, I'm Jimmy. My channel is called bright insight,

256
00:18:00.090 --> 00:18:02.400
hit the like button and subscribe. And again, leave a comment,

257
00:18:02.401 --> 00:18:07.050
sharing your thoughts, but stay tuned to another video real soon. Take care,

258
00:18:07.051 --> 00:18:07.530
everybody.
