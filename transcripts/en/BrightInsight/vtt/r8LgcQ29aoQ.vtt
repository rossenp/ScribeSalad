00:00:02.860 --> 00:00:03.760
<v 0>The math itself,</v>

2
00:00:03.850 --> 00:00:08.720
completely debunks the mainstream explanation for how the ancient Egyptians were

3
00:00:08.721 --> 00:00:12.520
able to construct the great pyramid of Giza and how long it took them to do. So.

4
00:00:12.700 --> 00:00:13.533
And in this video,

5
00:00:13.540 --> 00:00:17.120
I'm gonna share with you a few short video clips of the most common methods

6
00:00:17.230 --> 00:00:20.440
described by mainstream archeologists, Egyptologists,

7
00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:24.710
and academics for how the ancient are able to cut and carve these stones.

8
00:00:25.090 --> 00:00:27.550
So you can see firsthand with your own eyes,

9
00:00:27.620 --> 00:00:30.590
just how flawed these methods truly are. Now,

10
00:00:30.591 --> 00:00:34.310
depending on what source you look at the timeframes vary on how long it took the

11
00:00:34.311 --> 00:00:38.550
ancient Egyptians to construct the great pyramid of Giza ranging from 10 to 30

12
00:00:38.551 --> 00:00:42.030
years. However, 20 years is the most commonly accepted timeframe.

13
00:00:42.630 --> 00:00:47.100
It's what they teach in school 20 years to cut, carve, move,

14
00:00:47.240 --> 00:00:52.180
and perfectly place. Approximately 2.5 million stone blocks.

15
00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:55.860
That's equivalent to one block every two minutes and six seconds.

16
00:00:56.240 --> 00:00:59.380
The precision of these two and a half million stone blocks is incredible.

17
00:00:59.920 --> 00:01:02.780
Not even a razor or a pin needle can fit between them.

18
00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:06.050
And just to remind a ourselves, each block has six sides.

19
00:01:06.130 --> 00:01:07.250
I don't mean to be patronizing,

20
00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:11.570
but just as a visual reminder that each block would've had to been perfect on

21
00:01:11.571 --> 00:01:15.170
all six sides. And although the size of these stone blocks did vary.

22
00:01:15.470 --> 00:01:18.970
The average size was 50 inches by 50 inches by 27.

23
00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:21.650
And you can see here the metric conversion on the screen,

24
00:01:22.030 --> 00:01:25.240
but this of course does not include some of the blocks that are absolutely

25
00:01:25.241 --> 00:01:29.240
massive to give us a better appreciation of the massive scale of the great

26
00:01:29.241 --> 00:01:29.910
pyramid.

27
00:01:29.910 --> 00:01:34.440
It's more than 755 feet long at its base and is made up of more than

28
00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:38.120
200 layers. And each layer had to be absolutely perfect.

29
00:01:38.390 --> 00:01:42.440
Each block had to be laid down in place down to a fraction of a millimeter.

30
00:01:42.440 --> 00:01:47.310
Otherwise the entire pyramid would not have nearly as precise as it is out of

31
00:01:47.311 --> 00:01:48.910
these two and a half million stone blocks.

32
00:01:49.150 --> 00:01:52.070
A significant majority of them are made up of limestone.

33
00:01:52.490 --> 00:01:56.350
And one of the most common methods described by Egyptologists is that the

34
00:01:56.351 --> 00:02:00.390
Egyptians use stone hammers and bronze chisels to cut and carve these stones.

35
00:02:00.570 --> 00:02:04.470
And real quick, if you're not familiar, bronze is a makeup of copper and tin.

36
00:02:05.070 --> 00:02:08.180
Let me jump a into the first video clip, which includes mark Laneer.

37
00:02:08.200 --> 00:02:12.340
One of the most leading authorities on Egyptology and the works of the pyramids

38
00:02:12.341 --> 00:02:12.901
and the spanks.

39
00:02:12.901 --> 00:02:16.300
And you'll find his name cited in almost every single textbook throughout the

40
00:02:16.301 --> 00:02:18.460
world regarding these subjects in this video,

41
00:02:18.480 --> 00:02:22.740
you'll see that they tried and cut and carve one limestone block down to half

42
00:02:22.741 --> 00:02:25.500
the size of the great Finks, his nose and real quick,

43
00:02:25.501 --> 00:02:28.370
you'll see sub captions in this video. Those are not my words.

44
00:02:28.371 --> 00:02:31.410
That's from the person that uploaded this and I'll include the link to that

45
00:02:31.411 --> 00:02:33.410
seven minute video in the description. However,

46
00:02:33.690 --> 00:02:37.010
I edit it down to show just the highlights and this clip is about 55 seconds

47
00:02:37.120 --> 00:02:38.290
long. Here we go.

48
00:02:42.070 --> 00:02:45.850
<v 1>But even with reinforcement and after hours of pounding,</v>

49
00:02:46.830 --> 00:02:48.360
they barely made a dent.

50
00:02:51.610 --> 00:02:53.000
After days of work,

51
00:02:53.290 --> 00:02:57.200
their copper chisels and stone pounders are barely making a dent.

52
00:03:00.490 --> 00:03:03.760
Brown is wearing down tools at an extraordinary rate.

53
00:03:06.180 --> 00:03:07.160
The copper chisel,

54
00:03:07.161 --> 00:03:11.520
the ancient Egyptians would've used last only a few dozen strikes.

55
00:03:13.300 --> 00:03:17.880
The heating pounding cycle is repeated over and over ready. I'm ready. Yep.

56
00:03:17.970 --> 00:03:19.830
Until the of shape is just right.

57
00:03:21.900 --> 00:03:26.470
<v 2>They must have amassed more copper for building the great pyramid in this faith</v>

58
00:03:27.020 --> 00:03:31.070
than just about any place in the world. In the third millennium BC. I mean,

59
00:03:31.071 --> 00:03:33.310
it just must have been a huge cost in.

60
00:03:33.310 --> 00:03:37.310
<v 0>Copper. Wow. So just a few dozen strikes per chisel.</v>

61
00:03:37.490 --> 00:03:41.380
And then you saw how long it takes to him to reshape this thing. I mean,

62
00:03:41.381 --> 00:03:45.380
heating it and cooling it several times, an incredibly lengthy period of time.

63
00:03:45.560 --> 00:03:49.180
And you heard mark Layner himself discuss how the Egyptians would've had a

64
00:03:49.181 --> 00:03:51.220
massive amount of copper chisels,

65
00:03:51.390 --> 00:03:54.260
which hasn't been found and I'll touch on that point later in this video.

66
00:03:54.480 --> 00:03:56.900
And by the way, they didn't even finish this project.

67
00:03:57.170 --> 00:04:00.610
They brought in power tools and it took professional those more than two weeks

68
00:04:00.910 --> 00:04:03.370
to cut and carve this nose. Now, like I mentioned,

69
00:04:03.410 --> 00:04:06.570
a significant majority of the great pyramid is made up of limestone blocks.

70
00:04:06.720 --> 00:04:09.290
However, the internal structure is made up of granite.

71
00:04:09.560 --> 00:04:13.370
This includes the internal passageways, the massive grand gallery,

72
00:04:14.110 --> 00:04:18.130
the Queen's chamber, as well as the King's chamber itself. And these blocks,

73
00:04:18.440 --> 00:04:23.000
many of them are more than 70 tons and seemingly have laser cut precision.

74
00:04:23.220 --> 00:04:26.880
So here's a quick 22nd clip on using bronze chisels on granite,

75
00:04:26.881 --> 00:04:29.800
which is significantly stronger than limestone. When Roger.

76
00:04:30.200 --> 00:04:33.520
<v 3>Tries chiseled made from bronze, the results are disappointing.</v>

77
00:04:37.420 --> 00:04:38.253
<v 4>As you can see,</v>

78
00:04:39.320 --> 00:04:43.750
we're just leaving a lot of metal and very little stone is flaky.

79
00:04:48.170 --> 00:04:50.750
<v 0>So regardless of whether we're talking limestone or granite,</v>

80
00:04:50.930 --> 00:04:55.110
the bronze chisel stone hammer theory is debunked. It doesn't make sense.

81
00:04:55.250 --> 00:04:58.030
It doesn't compute based on the time and the precision.

82
00:04:58.130 --> 00:05:01.380
So this brings me back to the question on where are all the bronze chisels now,

83
00:05:01.800 --> 00:05:04.940
why have they found so few, I'm trying to find a specific number,

84
00:05:05.280 --> 00:05:07.820
but have they found even more than a few dozen of these things throughout the

85
00:05:07.821 --> 00:05:11.780
entire country of Egypt? I mean, if anyone has a specific number, please share,

86
00:05:11.781 --> 00:05:13.500
I've been trying to research this for myself,

87
00:05:13.880 --> 00:05:17.460
but clearly they would've had to have had hundreds of thousands of these tools.

88
00:05:17.660 --> 00:05:20.140
I mean, two dozen strikes per chisel,

89
00:05:20.160 --> 00:05:23.290
and it takes much longer than most people realize to reshape it.

90
00:05:23.650 --> 00:05:26.490
I think the most logical explanation of why they're not finding so many bronze

91
00:05:26.520 --> 00:05:30.050
chisels is the fact they just weren't using these as the primary method to cut

92
00:05:30.051 --> 00:05:32.010
and carve tens of millions of stone blocks.

93
00:05:32.520 --> 00:05:35.250
This brings me on to a more common and popular theory,

94
00:05:35.251 --> 00:05:38.730
which is utilizing copper and bronze saws to cut through these stones.

95
00:05:39.070 --> 00:05:40.090
And as you can see here,

96
00:05:40.091 --> 00:05:44.720
these are clip art images provided by Egypt on the theory of using copper saws

97
00:05:44.721 --> 00:05:45.600
to cut through stone.

98
00:05:45.700 --> 00:05:49.000
So let me show you the next video clip that shows them trying to utilize copper

99
00:05:49.230 --> 00:05:51.520
saws on granite. All right. We.

100
00:05:51.520 --> 00:05:55.840
<v 2>Have a big block of granite here, so how's this copper gonna cut this granite,</v>

101
00:05:55.841 --> 00:05:56.120
even.

102
00:05:56.120 --> 00:05:58.960
<v 5>With teeth, the copper alone is too soft.</v>

103
00:05:59.490 --> 00:06:04.000
We're going to put sand inside the groove and we're going to put this so on top

104
00:06:04.001 --> 00:06:06.760
of the sand and then let the sand do the cutting.

105
00:06:09.500 --> 00:06:13.720
Now, Dennis, when we see any progress in our lifetime. Yes. Um,

106
00:06:14.140 --> 00:06:15.880
if you came back in an hour's time,

107
00:06:15.980 --> 00:06:20.270
you would see about a four millimeter crop down into the stone. You're kidding.

108
00:06:20.550 --> 00:06:22.910
In an hour, you'll be four millimeters down. Well,

109
00:06:22.980 --> 00:06:27.070
I've been doing a lot of experiments and I can guarantee that this will cook

110
00:06:27.350 --> 00:06:29.990
through the stone. That's about four millimeters an hour.

111
00:06:34.550 --> 00:06:39.100
<v 4>The sign went wonderful. Once we switched over using, uh, water with the sand.</v>

112
00:06:39.760 --> 00:06:42.980
As you can see here, we achieved this in just a few days.

113
00:06:45.010 --> 00:06:49.340
<v 0>Four millimeters an hour, that's equivalent to about one sixth of one inch.</v>

114
00:06:49.800 --> 00:06:52.260
And although they said it went much quicker while using water,

115
00:06:52.261 --> 00:06:55.060
they didn't specify how much quicker. I mean, was it twice as fast?

116
00:06:55.200 --> 00:06:58.250
Was it even that much? This just assumed that it was six to times as fast.

117
00:06:58.550 --> 00:07:02.010
So one inch an hour that still doesn't compute whatsoever.

118
00:07:02.230 --> 00:07:05.930
And this doesn't include the fact that they've never found a copper saw of this

119
00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:08.410
size anywhere throughout ancient Egypt. In fact,

120
00:07:08.411 --> 00:07:12.250
you won't even find any depictions of it through wall paintings, hieroglyphs,

121
00:07:12.251 --> 00:07:14.130
petroglyphs, nowhere. In fact,

122
00:07:14.131 --> 00:07:17.210
the only art that you'll find is just a few different images where they have

123
00:07:17.211 --> 00:07:21.080
these smaller copper saws and they utilize them to cut wood.

124
00:07:21.500 --> 00:07:25.280
And as you can see here, here's the best example I could find of a copper saw.

125
00:07:25.740 --> 00:07:28.880
And look at that that's not even a two foot blade, is that even 18 inches,

126
00:07:28.881 --> 00:07:30.240
maybe 20 inches altogether.

127
00:07:30.540 --> 00:07:33.560
And we're supposed to believe that these small saws and I'll show you more

128
00:07:33.561 --> 00:07:37.040
examples of them in just a moment we're used to cut and carve even an average

129
00:07:37.070 --> 00:07:38.200
size block. I mean,

130
00:07:38.201 --> 00:07:41.630
nevermind the much larger stone blocks frowned throughout the pyramid of Giza.

131
00:07:41.810 --> 00:07:44.310
But again, that video is showing you cutting through granite.

132
00:07:44.330 --> 00:07:48.310
So let me show you a different video clip of people using hand saws to cut

133
00:07:48.311 --> 00:07:49.350
through limestone blocks.

134
00:07:49.770 --> 00:07:53.310
And although this video has nothing to do with Egyptology whatsoever,

135
00:07:53.311 --> 00:07:57.550
these are just some old school guys that show you that you can use hand saws to

136
00:07:57.551 --> 00:07:59.940
cut through limestone. Well, you here's the video clip.

137
00:08:33.830 --> 00:08:35.930
So a couple notable points right off the bat is,

138
00:08:35.931 --> 00:08:37.490
did you see how long those saws were?

139
00:08:37.491 --> 00:08:40.960
They must have been longer than five feet not to mention they were not made up

140
00:08:40.961 --> 00:08:42.200
of copper whatsoever.

141
00:08:42.700 --> 00:08:46.240
And also take a look at the aggressive cross-cut teeth that these saws had.

142
00:08:46.350 --> 00:08:48.760
Clearly the ancient Egyptians had nothing like this.

143
00:08:48.830 --> 00:08:51.280
There's not one single bit of evidence to suggest it.

144
00:08:51.500 --> 00:08:54.480
And it's worth mentioning that the finished product isn't perfect at all.

145
00:08:54.560 --> 00:08:56.320
I mean, yeah, there are some very straight lines,

146
00:08:56.740 --> 00:08:59.800
but when you look at the block as a whole, it's just not perfect.

147
00:08:59.860 --> 00:09:03.640
So they would've had a gun back over it with what bronze chisels. Again,

148
00:09:03.830 --> 00:09:07.160
another point worth mentioning is how difficult the sign becomes when you get

149
00:09:07.161 --> 00:09:09.880
down to the base of the block. I mean, take, for example,

150
00:09:09.980 --> 00:09:14.080
the limestone query located right there on the Giza plateau. Imagine with,

151
00:09:14.200 --> 00:09:17.390
I mean the that's right on bedrock. Look how little room you have to work with.

152
00:09:17.890 --> 00:09:21.030
How could you cut the base of that stone block and not to mention,

153
00:09:21.170 --> 00:09:21.871
as you see here,

154
00:09:21.871 --> 00:09:25.670
these other examples of these bronze saws found throughout ancient Egypt.

155
00:09:26.350 --> 00:09:27.830
I mean, they're incredibly short.

156
00:09:27.831 --> 00:09:31.110
None of them exceed two feet long and I'm under the impression. I mean,

157
00:09:31.111 --> 00:09:34.710
have they even found a dozen of these things ever? Does anyone have an estimate?

158
00:09:35.110 --> 00:09:37.180
These are all the examples I could find pictures of,

159
00:09:37.720 --> 00:09:39.660
but it really raises a lot of questions.

160
00:09:39.930 --> 00:09:43.620
Clearly this method just does not compute and not to mention the complete lack

161
00:09:43.621 --> 00:09:44.780
of evidence to support it.

162
00:09:45.160 --> 00:09:48.820
Are we supposed to believe that this would've been a method utilized to be able

163
00:09:48.821 --> 00:09:49.700
to cut, carve,

164
00:09:49.701 --> 00:09:54.220
move in place perfectly one block every two minutes in six seconds, guys,

165
00:09:54.221 --> 00:09:57.090
it doesn't add up. Let me me transition into another example,

166
00:09:57.100 --> 00:10:01.810
which is utilizing wood wedges that are soaked in water in order to split apart

167
00:10:01.811 --> 00:10:04.850
massive stone blocks. And there is evidence of this, as you can see here,

168
00:10:04.851 --> 00:10:07.130
these are examples from the S one quarry,

169
00:10:07.131 --> 00:10:09.930
which is about 500 miles from the great pyramids. First,

170
00:10:09.931 --> 00:10:13.490
it must be mentioned that the soaked wood would not provide nearly as a precise

171
00:10:13.590 --> 00:10:15.370
cut as using chisels.

172
00:10:15.710 --> 00:10:18.600
So modern times you can see people doing it here in these examples,

173
00:10:18.601 --> 00:10:19.380
these photos,

174
00:10:19.380 --> 00:10:23.320
but the end product does not justify the incredible precision of the stone

175
00:10:23.321 --> 00:10:25.280
blocks at the great pyramid of Giza.

176
00:10:25.500 --> 00:10:28.320
Are we supposed to believe that they would've gone back over that stone block

177
00:10:28.321 --> 00:10:31.400
with bronze chisels and copper saws all over again,

178
00:10:31.401 --> 00:10:34.680
when we've already seen that those methods don't work anyhow and not to mention

179
00:10:34.760 --> 00:10:38.230
a complete lack of evidence on the Giza plateau to support that this is the

180
00:10:38.231 --> 00:10:41.470
method that they were utilizing. Yes, the ancient Egyptians did do this.

181
00:10:41.471 --> 00:10:43.470
We have evidence at the Ason qu again,

182
00:10:44.090 --> 00:10:47.430
but nothing to justify two and a half million stone blocks, not at all.

183
00:10:47.810 --> 00:10:50.710
And we have to remind ourselves that we're only discussing the great pyramid of

184
00:10:50.820 --> 00:10:55.790
Giza. There are between 118 and 138 pyramids scattered throughout Egypt.

185
00:10:56.170 --> 00:10:56.711
And in fact,

186
00:10:56.711 --> 00:11:00.020
this is isn't even updated because as I mentioned in other videos just earlier

187
00:11:00.090 --> 00:11:03.940
this year, they found an entirely new pyramid in ruins under the sands of Egypt,

188
00:11:03.990 --> 00:11:08.140
which again, raises all kinds of questions. But for hundreds of pyramids,

189
00:11:08.350 --> 00:11:10.300
we're talking tens of millions of stone blocks.

190
00:11:10.920 --> 00:11:14.500
And if they can't compute these or finish or construct one pyramid in the 20,

191
00:11:14.501 --> 00:11:18.370
30 year timeframe, it completely debunks the entire near. Now.

192
00:11:18.410 --> 00:11:21.490
I certainly don't think that everything is a conspiracy or a coverup,

193
00:11:21.710 --> 00:11:23.610
but we have to start asking serious questions.

194
00:11:23.840 --> 00:11:27.650
When the leading authorities on the topic of Egyptology whose works are

195
00:11:27.651 --> 00:11:31.730
published and textbooks all over the world regarding the pyramids and the Finks,

196
00:11:32.150 --> 00:11:35.730
and these individuals have seen firsthand with their own eyes that none of these

197
00:11:35.731 --> 00:11:36.570
methods compute.

198
00:11:36.830 --> 00:11:40.400
And yet they've done nothing to who bring this up or raise the question of

199
00:11:40.450 --> 00:11:43.760
developing new theories and asking new questions instead to keep pushing the

200
00:11:43.761 --> 00:11:45.880
same narrative. They're teaching this in school right now.

201
00:11:45.881 --> 00:11:50.000
They're handing out PhDs with these methods and nobody seems to be thinking for

202
00:11:50.001 --> 00:11:53.240
themselves to just try them and to make this even more disturbing.

203
00:11:53.710 --> 00:11:54.543
This same guy,

204
00:11:54.800 --> 00:11:58.280
mark Laneer seems to be going along with this 10 year timeframe he's doubling

205
00:11:58.510 --> 00:12:01.200
down instead of acknowledging that these methods don't work,

206
00:12:01.550 --> 00:12:05.440
he's going along with a possible 10 year timeframe that's been discussed by

207
00:12:05.441 --> 00:12:08.320
other Egyptologists. What is going on?

208
00:12:08.510 --> 00:12:11.560
It's time we start asking serious questions about it, but I'll leave it at that.

209
00:12:12.240 --> 00:12:14.910
Leave me at common. Let me know what your thoughts are, but like, and subscribe.

210
00:12:15.090 --> 00:12:16.590
I'm Jimmy. This is bright insight,

211
00:12:16.860 --> 00:12:20.230
many more videos to come on a whole wide variety of topics. Take care,

212
00:12:20.231 --> 00:12:20.590
everybody.
