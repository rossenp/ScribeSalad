00:00:02.140 --> 00:00:06.000
<v 0>The narrative taught to us by Egyptologists about the truth of ancient human</v>

2
00:00:06.040 --> 00:00:06.841
civilization.

3
00:00:06.841 --> 00:00:11.360
Particularly that of ancient Egyptians is so full of holes that they are now

4
00:00:11.370 --> 00:00:14.760
quite literally debunking themselves. In fact,

5
00:00:14.761 --> 00:00:18.040
you may have seen news articles making headlines around the world of how

6
00:00:18.320 --> 00:00:21.640
researchers have decoded the genome of ancient Egyptians. For the very,

7
00:00:22.970 --> 00:00:23.351
in fact,

8
00:00:23.351 --> 00:00:27.270
the findings have turned years of theory on its head causing Egyptologists to

9
00:00:27.271 --> 00:00:29.430
reevaluate the region's history altogether.

10
00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:33.830
<v 1>The study tested preserved remains from an archeological site along the Nile</v>

11
00:00:33.831 --> 00:00:38.630
river in middle Egypt, then compared the DNA to modern Egyptians in chiro,

12
00:00:39.170 --> 00:00:43.940
the study found that the mums closest ancient relative were from the near east

13
00:00:43.960 --> 00:00:47.380
or west Asia and Europe. So in other words,

14
00:00:47.480 --> 00:00:52.260
modern Egyptians have more in common with Sub-Sahara Africa than

15
00:00:52.360 --> 00:00:53.700
the ancient Egyptians do,

16
00:00:53.830 --> 00:00:57.220
which just completely debunks everything they thought they knew about the human

17
00:00:57.221 --> 00:01:00.540
migration process into ancient Egypt and elsewhere around the world.

18
00:01:00.880 --> 00:01:04.410
<v 0>Now it's worth mentioning that they did testing from just one site in middle</v>

19
00:01:04.540 --> 00:01:08.330
Egypt for more than 150 Egyptian mummies. Now,

20
00:01:08.331 --> 00:01:10.890
obviously they need to do more testing from other sites,

21
00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:15.010
but it almost tells me that they chose this site just to validate their current

22
00:01:15.011 --> 00:01:17.290
narrative. I mean, any research you do on this,

23
00:01:17.291 --> 00:01:21.090
you'll see just how shocked these people truly were to have these findings.

24
00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:23.330
But why are these people always so shocked? I mean,

25
00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:26.400
and we learn throughout history that we constantly debunk ourselves,

26
00:01:26.590 --> 00:01:29.400
that what we knew yesterday turns out to be false tomorrow.

27
00:01:29.660 --> 00:01:32.000
And these people just can't seem to wrap their minds around it.

28
00:01:32.090 --> 00:01:35.000
Maybe it's because of the fact that they memorized definitions in textbook

29
00:01:35.190 --> 00:01:38.480
decades ago. And they've been handing out degrees on the subject matter,

30
00:01:38.570 --> 00:01:41.480
which is as we've learned full of falsehoods for decades.

31
00:01:41.800 --> 00:01:44.950
And they've been handing out these degrees to tens of thousands people that they

32
00:01:44.951 --> 00:01:48.190
just don't wanna accept the fact that, well, they've been wrong from the get go.

33
00:01:48.670 --> 00:01:48.911
I mean,

34
00:01:48.911 --> 00:01:51.790
we've already learned in just the last year and a half that they're finding

35
00:01:51.791 --> 00:01:55.070
native American DNA to contain middle Eastern DNA,

36
00:01:55.280 --> 00:01:59.430
which is just a complete shock and a complete mystery. And on top of that,

37
00:01:59.431 --> 00:02:04.310
they're finding DNA in south American mummies that have DNA from Aborigines from

38
00:02:04.390 --> 00:02:06.020
all Australia. I mean,

39
00:02:06.021 --> 00:02:09.940
you could pretty much just take the known human migration pattern map and throw

40
00:02:09.941 --> 00:02:13.380
it out the window because it has just been overwhelmingly debunked. I mean,

41
00:02:13.381 --> 00:02:18.340
how in the world do you have Australian Aboriginal DNA in south American mums,

42
00:02:18.520 --> 00:02:20.660
but not in the remains of north American Indians,

43
00:02:20.930 --> 00:02:22.420
I've discussed this in other videos,

44
00:02:22.520 --> 00:02:24.740
but it just goes to show you that quite literally,

45
00:02:25.060 --> 00:02:28.930
these Egyptologists have no idea what they're talking about. I mean,

46
00:02:28.931 --> 00:02:32.130
how do they explain the fact that there are tens of thousands of ancient

47
00:02:32.250 --> 00:02:36.850
Egyptian petroglyphs and hieroglyphs that show the ancient Egyptians or dynastic

48
00:02:36.851 --> 00:02:37.890
Egyptians, I should say,

49
00:02:38.100 --> 00:02:42.810
doing all kinds of different things yet there's a complete lack zero information

50
00:02:42.811 --> 00:02:46.520
whatsoever about how they built the great Spinks or the at pyramids altogether,

51
00:02:46.850 --> 00:02:51.240
which further validates when you take this newfound DNA evidence that there was

52
00:02:51.241 --> 00:02:54.960
indeed a cataly that reset ancient human civilization.

53
00:02:54.980 --> 00:02:57.880
So whoever built the Finks in the pyramids, well,

54
00:02:57.881 --> 00:03:00.840
they were wiped out during the last cataly 13,000 years ago.

55
00:03:01.100 --> 00:03:04.640
And the dynastic Egyptians that we know of came and found the remains of these

56
00:03:04.641 --> 00:03:06.640
ancient sites and just built on top of them,

57
00:03:07.070 --> 00:03:10.480
I've discussed the overwhelming evidence of the cataly and multiple other

58
00:03:10.540 --> 00:03:13.480
videos. So I'll just hold off there, but just to paint you a picture,

59
00:03:13.510 --> 00:03:15.080
I've discussed this in other videos as well,

60
00:03:15.100 --> 00:03:18.080
but when you look at the overwhelming evidence from the enclosure of the great

61
00:03:18.440 --> 00:03:22.110
fi it proves that the age of the great Finks is at least doubly age of what

62
00:03:22.111 --> 00:03:26.070
we've been taught in very likely to be tens of thousands of years old based on

63
00:03:26.071 --> 00:03:27.910
the water erosion around it. I mean,

64
00:03:27.930 --> 00:03:31.310
anyone that doesn't acknowledge this has either not looked at the research or is

65
00:03:31.320 --> 00:03:34.990
lying just to protect their own financial incentives because the evidence is

66
00:03:34.991 --> 00:03:36.950
overwhelmingly conclusive that yes,

67
00:03:37.210 --> 00:03:40.860
the great Finks is far it than what we've been taught in school or with the

68
00:03:40.861 --> 00:03:44.580
narrative that the Egyptologists have been teaching for decades. And in fact,

69
00:03:44.581 --> 00:03:47.420
you have professional geologists take, for example, Robert shock,

70
00:03:47.480 --> 00:03:50.340
and more than 200 other professional geologists from around the world,

71
00:03:50.600 --> 00:03:54.540
dozens of countries that have evaluated the spanks and have said that, yes,

72
00:03:54.560 --> 00:03:58.460
it looks like there might be 20 to 30,000 years of water erosion around it,

73
00:03:58.870 --> 00:04:03.690
which it it's worth mentioning that there is more than 30,000 years of Egyptian

74
00:04:03.691 --> 00:04:07.490
lineage from the pharaohs literally carved in stone throughout ancient Egypt,

75
00:04:07.790 --> 00:04:09.370
and yet modern Egyptologists,

76
00:04:09.440 --> 00:04:12.610
just blow that off and see its symbolism of something else that it's wrong.

77
00:04:12.800 --> 00:04:15.850
That obviously we don't date back 30,000 years. That's just impossible.

78
00:04:15.910 --> 00:04:20.520
We don't have the evidence. The evidence is right in front of you and long.

79
00:04:20.640 --> 00:04:20.841
I mean,

80
00:04:20.841 --> 00:04:24.000
how many times do these people have to be debunked for them to register the fact

81
00:04:24.001 --> 00:04:26.560
that maybe there's a lot more that they don't know than they know.

82
00:04:26.580 --> 00:04:28.640
And it's time to start asking new questions.

83
00:04:29.150 --> 00:04:32.320
It's time that they start acknowledging all the overwhelming evidence of the

84
00:04:32.340 --> 00:04:34.720
cataly that happened 11,600 years ago,

85
00:04:34.721 --> 00:04:39.000
and 13,000 years ago that shows you that there was an advanced civilization of

86
00:04:39.001 --> 00:04:42.590
some kind that existed. And they were wiped out following that cataly.

87
00:04:42.930 --> 00:04:43.511
And hence,

88
00:04:43.511 --> 00:04:47.150
the reason why we don't know anything that happened more than 6,000 years ago,

89
00:04:47.410 --> 00:04:51.430
yet modern humans as we are today have existed for at least 150,000 years,

90
00:04:51.550 --> 00:04:54.150
possibly as much as 300, 350,000 years,

91
00:04:54.151 --> 00:04:58.070
as we saw in recent articles going around, which I discussed in another video.

92
00:04:58.870 --> 00:04:59.071
I mean,

93
00:04:59.071 --> 00:05:02.500
do you ever wonder why we just have zero knowledge dating back more than 6,000

94
00:05:02.501 --> 00:05:05.140
years and even 6,000 years ago was totally foggy.

95
00:05:05.400 --> 00:05:08.620
And there's limited information about that altogether. Like I said,

96
00:05:08.621 --> 00:05:10.180
it's time to start asking new questions,

97
00:05:10.280 --> 00:05:14.700
but clearly the true history of ancient human civilization is far older and we

98
00:05:14.820 --> 00:05:17.900
were far more advanced than we were ever taught in school. Anyways, guys,

99
00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:20.700
I'm Jimmy, this is bright insight like in subscribe and leave me a comment.

100
00:05:20.980 --> 00:05:21.930
Let me know what your are.

101
00:05:22.150 --> 00:05:25.730
And they have many other videos to come and a whole wide variety of topics take

102
00:05:25.731 --> 00:05:26.290
care of everybody.
