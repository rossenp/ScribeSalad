00:00:02.980 --> 00:00:07.440
<v 0>Is it possible that NASA has not told the general public everything they know</v>

2
00:00:07.490 --> 00:00:11.680
about the planet Mars take, for example, the popular discussion,

3
00:00:11.681 --> 00:00:15.240
whether life ever existed on Mars, which NASA has stated was possible,

4
00:00:15.420 --> 00:00:19.920
but it had to have been at least three closer to 4 billion years ago

5
00:00:20.290 --> 00:00:24.470
based on evidence of oceans lakes and is once existing on Mars.

6
00:00:24.980 --> 00:00:27.350
<v 3>However, how could these terrain features,</v>

7
00:00:27.351 --> 00:00:31.470
which are found throughout virtually the entire surface of Mars have survived

8
00:00:31.471 --> 00:00:36.390
billions of years of erosion and routine sandstorms of tropical storm strength

9
00:00:36.410 --> 00:00:37.990
as I'll be discussing here shortly,

10
00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:42.470
let me start off by showing you a very short clip that I edited down of a

11
00:00:42.471 --> 00:00:47.100
conversation between Congressman war bucker and a NASA executive in July of this

12
00:00:47.101 --> 00:00:47.980
year, which you may have seen.

13
00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:51.140
And I made a video on this topic and I'll include a link for it at the end of

14
00:00:51.141 --> 00:00:54.540
this video, but for this video, I'm making a completely different point.

15
00:00:54.840 --> 00:00:55.940
So take a look at this,

16
00:00:56.160 --> 00:00:59.020
ignore the part about ancient civilization in that's discuss.

17
00:00:59.720 --> 00:01:02.700
<v 1>You have indicated that Mars had a, uh,</v>

18
00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:05.250
was totally different thousands of years ago.

19
00:01:05.950 --> 00:01:10.850
Is it possible that there was a civilization on Mars thousands of years ago?

20
00:01:13.190 --> 00:01:17.130
<v 2>So the evidence is that, um, Mars was different billions of years ago,</v>

21
00:01:17.131 --> 00:01:20.850
not thousands of years ago. Well, yes, that, and, and, um, there would be,

22
00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:24.210
there is no evidence that, uh, I'm aware of that.

23
00:01:24.650 --> 00:01:28.280
<v 1>Would you rule, would you rule that out that see there's some people? Well.</v>

24
00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:32.400
<v 2>Anyway, I would, I would say that is extremely unlikely.</v>

25
00:01:32.790 --> 00:01:33.720
<v 0>Okay. Now again,</v>

26
00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:37.320
ignore the part about ancient civilization for the point of this video and just

27
00:01:37.321 --> 00:01:40.600
focus on the thousands of years ago versus the billions of years ago,

28
00:01:40.610 --> 00:01:45.590
discussion how on earth do these terrain features survive long period

29
00:01:45.591 --> 00:01:48.470
of time. And of course I'm gonna play devil's advocate here.

30
00:01:48.500 --> 00:01:52.470
NASA themselves have shown evidence of running water on Mars existing today.

31
00:01:52.580 --> 00:01:56.590
Take for example, the abundance of ice at the north and south pole of Mars.

32
00:01:57.010 --> 00:02:00.790
And you can see that these ice caps change yearly based on season,

33
00:02:01.010 --> 00:02:04.710
as well as the fact that some of these ice portions do exist in various mountain

34
00:02:04.770 --> 00:02:06.580
ranges and CRAs on Mars.

35
00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:09.580
So although there is evidence of running water on Mars today,

36
00:02:09.730 --> 00:02:13.860
it's in certain areas and it doesn't explain the fact that there are water

37
00:02:13.900 --> 00:02:17.540
channels located thousands of miles from any type of ice.

38
00:02:18.120 --> 00:02:21.220
And they've survived billions of years of routine, sand storms.

39
00:02:21.510 --> 00:02:24.260
These storms are absolutely massive. And just to clarify,

40
00:02:24.290 --> 00:02:25.820
they're not of hurricane strength,

41
00:02:25.821 --> 00:02:29.890
like many people have often thought and seen in movies yet they're tropical

42
00:02:29.980 --> 00:02:31.810
storm strength, 70 miles an hour,

43
00:02:32.350 --> 00:02:36.770
and they are so massive that many of them can only truly be appreciated from

44
00:02:36.860 --> 00:02:38.290
orbit and satellite imagery.

45
00:02:38.910 --> 00:02:43.650
And you can see here that many of these storms will cover the entire planet and

46
00:02:43.651 --> 00:02:46.760
go on for hours on end and days on end in some cases is,

47
00:02:47.020 --> 00:02:49.840
and the effects of these storms on the surface are massive.

48
00:02:49.940 --> 00:02:54.280
And you can see here the differences on how the terrain changes based off just

49
00:02:54.340 --> 00:02:59.000
one storm. So if NASA is so adamant that the surface of Mars,

50
00:02:59.200 --> 00:03:03.320
different three closer to 4 billion years ago, which by the way, dig into that,

51
00:03:03.321 --> 00:03:06.360
I'll have to make, this is just be part one there's other points to be made.

52
00:03:06.540 --> 00:03:07.840
So look forward to other videos.

53
00:03:08.140 --> 00:03:11.480
But if you look at the fine print on how they explain these these billions of

54
00:03:11.481 --> 00:03:12.800
years, I mean,

55
00:03:12.860 --> 00:03:15.720
it doesn't really make sense and they don't have a way to prove it. I mean,

56
00:03:15.721 --> 00:03:19.590
have we sent people to Mars to do the testing? These RO can only do so much.

57
00:03:19.591 --> 00:03:23.070
So how can they honestly state 3 billion years, 4 billion years?

58
00:03:23.130 --> 00:03:27.270
Why not 1 billion? Why not 500 million. So getting away from those timeframes,

59
00:03:27.640 --> 00:03:31.510
we've seen the evidence that just one massive storm completely changes the

60
00:03:31.511 --> 00:03:34.830
terrain of Mars altogether. So how many sandstorms would've happened over,

61
00:03:35.610 --> 00:03:38.910
you know, three, 4 billion years? There's certainly more than one a,

62
00:03:39.220 --> 00:03:40.980
I don't have a specific number other than that,

63
00:03:41.180 --> 00:03:42.940
they a routine and they happen frequently.

64
00:03:43.480 --> 00:03:45.900
So what tens of billions of sand storms,

65
00:03:45.960 --> 00:03:50.100
and yet there are existing evidence of these lake beds,

66
00:03:50.101 --> 00:03:51.740
water channels, and rivers.

67
00:03:52.060 --> 00:03:55.260
I can understand some of the larger terrain features lasting a very long period

68
00:03:55.261 --> 00:03:56.940
of time. Maybe billions of years,

69
00:03:57.170 --> 00:04:00.530
take a look at these two photos here of the same river that NASA claims is

70
00:04:00.690 --> 00:04:03.490
evidence of ancient flooding from billions of years ago.

71
00:04:04.120 --> 00:04:06.290
This river is nearly a thousand miles long,

72
00:04:07.050 --> 00:04:11.570
a thousand feet deep in almost four and a half miles across absolutely massive.

73
00:04:12.190 --> 00:04:15.770
And yet they think that this would survive billions of years of erosion.

74
00:04:16.670 --> 00:04:20.400
How many tens of billions of sand storms is that that that would cover it up and

75
00:04:20.401 --> 00:04:24.040
re-expose it, the winds and sand of time would wear way at the edges.

76
00:04:24.540 --> 00:04:27.680
And we're supposed to believe that this much evidence would survive 3 billion

77
00:04:27.690 --> 00:04:32.000
years, but getting back to these other photos of rivers that are much,

78
00:04:32.001 --> 00:04:35.240
much smaller evidence of creeks, evidence of streams,

79
00:04:35.700 --> 00:04:39.040
and we're supposed to believe that these would survive billions of sea storms.

80
00:04:39.300 --> 00:04:40.480
So when it comes down to,

81
00:04:41.020 --> 00:04:45.070
it's not appropriate to say that these train features that are thousands of

82
00:04:45.071 --> 00:04:49.750
miles of any ice source whatsoever on Mars would survive billions of years

83
00:04:50.090 --> 00:04:54.910
or even millions of years, or even hundreds of thousands of years. In fact,

84
00:04:55.310 --> 00:04:57.390
thousands of years is the appropriate estimate.

85
00:04:57.630 --> 00:04:58.950
And many other people are talking about this,

86
00:04:58.951 --> 00:05:02.940
which is why Congressman Warbuck are of brought it up to this NASA executive and

87
00:05:02.941 --> 00:05:03.860
he didn't follow through, right.

88
00:05:03.861 --> 00:05:07.180
He didn't provide the evidence and he just let it go. He got weak in the moment.

89
00:05:07.660 --> 00:05:11.780
&lt;laugh&gt; but clearly you can see and just think for yourself that there's more to

90
00:05:11.781 --> 00:05:15.620
this story here. These terrain features do not survive billions of years.

91
00:05:15.621 --> 00:05:16.940
They don't survive millions of years.

92
00:05:17.080 --> 00:05:19.660
And I'm not saying none of them would perhaps they're, you know,

93
00:05:19.661 --> 00:05:21.890
when you have a thousand foot deep river,

94
00:05:21.891 --> 00:05:26.050
maybe that would survive a certain period of time, a very long period of time.

95
00:05:26.870 --> 00:05:28.370
But billions guys,

96
00:05:28.480 --> 00:05:31.450
clearly there's far more to the story of Mars than what we've been told.

97
00:05:31.550 --> 00:05:33.410
And there's other key points that are worthy of mention.

98
00:05:33.510 --> 00:05:35.290
So consider this video just part one,

99
00:05:35.550 --> 00:05:39.570
and there'll be others to come where I outline evidence of massive contradiction

100
00:05:39.571 --> 00:05:43.040
from what NASA has told us based on evidence that we and see for ourselves.

101
00:05:43.500 --> 00:05:46.160
So I'll leave it at that like, and subscribe and leave me a comment,

102
00:05:46.210 --> 00:05:47.560
share your thoughts on all of this.

103
00:05:47.860 --> 00:05:50.560
And I have many other videos to come and a whole wide variety of topics.

104
00:05:50.910 --> 00:05:51.760
Take care, everybody.
