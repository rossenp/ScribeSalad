00:00:01.180 --> 00:00:04.080
<v 0>Hey everybody. This is Jimmy with bright insight today.</v>

2
00:00:04.140 --> 00:00:06.440
I'm gonna talk with you about go Beckley Tepe.

3
00:00:07.140 --> 00:00:11.960
Bottom line is that this is 100% definitive proof that

4
00:00:12.020 --> 00:00:14.760
not only is the history of human civilization,

5
00:00:15.380 --> 00:00:17.280
far older than what we were taught in school.

6
00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:21.550
And what is actively still being taught at the public school's and universities,

7
00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:24.630
that it is also definitive evidence,

8
00:00:24.780 --> 00:00:28.550
that there is some sort of lost ancient high technology or machinery that was

9
00:00:28.630 --> 00:00:31.750
utilized to not only cut and carve these stones,

10
00:00:32.010 --> 00:00:34.510
but lift them and place them where they, where they are,

11
00:00:34.511 --> 00:00:38.470
because when we're talking weights as high as 40 to 60 tons,

12
00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:43.380
think about that. Like how about you research? What year was that?

13
00:00:43.381 --> 00:00:46.380
We finally developed a crane that could lift that type of weight and you have to

14
00:00:46.381 --> 00:00:47.214
ask yourself,

15
00:00:47.400 --> 00:00:52.220
how could this possibly have been done 12,000 years ago? Yes,

16
00:00:52.221 --> 00:00:55.020
that's right. 12,000 years ago, as, uh,

17
00:00:55.021 --> 00:00:58.140
they were able to carbonate from pottery and other artifacts that were located

18
00:00:58.160 --> 00:01:00.780
in around the site. Now put to put that in perspective,

19
00:01:01.460 --> 00:01:04.210
what it is currently being taught in school about ancient Egypt is that the

20
00:01:04.211 --> 00:01:08.330
pyramids are 4,500 years old. Now I have another video about that, which,

21
00:01:08.630 --> 00:01:11.370
you know, look, there's significant evidence that, you know,

22
00:01:11.510 --> 00:01:14.970
the ruins around ancient Egypt are significantly older than what we've been

23
00:01:14.971 --> 00:01:15.430
taught.

24
00:01:15.430 --> 00:01:20.010
But the bottom line here is that we have a site that is twice as old as

25
00:01:20.140 --> 00:01:24.320
stone hedge, and only 5% of it has been excavated.

26
00:01:24.860 --> 00:01:28.440
And it's huge. It's 50 times bigger than stone hedge. In fact,

27
00:01:28.441 --> 00:01:33.000
this is go Beckley Tepe is 90,000 square meters.

28
00:01:33.980 --> 00:01:36.960
That's bigger than 12 football fields. People like it's humongous.

29
00:01:37.220 --> 00:01:40.800
And guess what? It's located in Turkey. And just a few years ago,

30
00:01:40.980 --> 00:01:44.870
Turkey removed all of their funding for the excavation.

31
00:01:45.290 --> 00:01:48.990
And this thing hasn't been touched in a few years, and they're only 5%, uh,

32
00:01:48.991 --> 00:01:53.190
they've only excavated 5% of it as validated by ground penetrating radar.

33
00:01:53.540 --> 00:01:55.670
Like it's absolutely massive. I mean,

34
00:01:55.671 --> 00:01:57.990
you can see the pictures here of these T-shaped pillars,

35
00:01:58.100 --> 00:02:00.070
that range anywhere from 40 to 60 tons,

36
00:02:00.900 --> 00:02:03.940
some of the lower estimates as you'll read on Wiki, you say 20 times,

37
00:02:03.950 --> 00:02:04.741
which by the way,

38
00:02:04.741 --> 00:02:08.140
like if you're researching and getting your information from Wikipedia on

39
00:02:08.740 --> 00:02:11.460
anything having to do with ancient technology or ancient civilization,

40
00:02:11.490 --> 00:02:13.140
like you really need to double check,

41
00:02:13.160 --> 00:02:16.380
not only the sources they list on it because you'll see huge discrepancies,

42
00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:20.780
but you also need to look at information that's put out by leading archeologists

43
00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:24.370
and geologists about anyways, I don't even get me started on that subject,

44
00:02:24.550 --> 00:02:27.530
but the information's out there guys go look for it. It's it's there.

45
00:02:27.910 --> 00:02:30.570
Now what's even more interesting is that go,

46
00:02:30.890 --> 00:02:34.570
Beckley Tepe is aligned with the north south east and west equinoxes.

47
00:02:34.830 --> 00:02:38.250
And it also has alignment with various constellations in the sky. Like,

48
00:02:38.251 --> 00:02:38.971
it's unbelievable.

49
00:02:38.971 --> 00:02:42.050
Like how did they have the technology or the knowledge to do something like

50
00:02:42.051 --> 00:02:45.040
that? 12,000 fricking years ago, L you know,

51
00:02:45.130 --> 00:02:48.120
right now in what's being taught. And what we were taught is that,

52
00:02:48.360 --> 00:02:49.840
and they hardly even mentioned this in school too,

53
00:02:49.841 --> 00:02:51.080
but that's a whole other story is that,

54
00:02:51.300 --> 00:02:56.240
so the Sumerian culture located Mesopotamia dates back 6,000 years

55
00:02:56.340 --> 00:03:00.240
ago, and that is considered the first, you know, human civilization.

56
00:03:00.241 --> 00:03:03.280
They had the first writing, the first calendar, which we still use today,

57
00:03:03.380 --> 00:03:07.640
by the way, and as well as like various mathematical formulas and other things.

58
00:03:08.300 --> 00:03:11.800
So that's 6,000 years ago. So this is twice as old as that. And yet,

59
00:03:11.940 --> 00:03:15.240
if you look at the pictures, you're on just how complex this is,

60
00:03:15.550 --> 00:03:17.280
it's unbelievable. And by the way,

61
00:03:17.300 --> 00:03:21.590
the pictures that you're seeing mostly of foxes, snakes, wild boars cranes,

62
00:03:21.820 --> 00:03:25.790
wild ducks, um, but they also have various, uh, human, uh,

63
00:03:25.791 --> 00:03:28.310
extremities that appear on some of the pillars, uh,

64
00:03:28.380 --> 00:03:31.310
arms and even show some with a, uh, a tail it's really,

65
00:03:31.311 --> 00:03:33.270
really interesting stuff. Um,

66
00:03:33.370 --> 00:03:37.630
but this wasn't discovered until 1995 go Beckley Tepi was discovered by

67
00:03:37.660 --> 00:03:40.700
professor Schmidt from, uh, the German archeological Institute.

68
00:03:41.120 --> 00:03:44.180
And these T-shaped pillars by the way that you're looking at are anywhere from

69
00:03:44.181 --> 00:03:47.740
three to six meters tall. Uh, so in other words, approximately 20 feet,

70
00:03:48.540 --> 00:03:51.660
and at some point, so like I said, this was discovered in 1995,

71
00:03:51.661 --> 00:03:55.820
but at some point in the long PA distant past, this was buried,

72
00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:57.860
it was deliberately buried and you,

73
00:03:58.180 --> 00:04:02.570
and the way they've excavated with the stones and sand and gravel were

74
00:04:02.640 --> 00:04:06.450
literally dumped into this huge area. Why, who knows,

75
00:04:06.520 --> 00:04:09.090
like maybe someone was trying to hide it, maybe they were trying to preserve it.

76
00:04:09.120 --> 00:04:11.730
There's a million theories, but nobody knows obviously, right,

77
00:04:12.230 --> 00:04:15.850
but there's over 200 of these pillars of these T-shaped pillars.

78
00:04:16.230 --> 00:04:17.930
And they're absolutely ginormous.

79
00:04:18.510 --> 00:04:22.200
And when you consider that this is 7,000 years older than Stonehenge,

80
00:04:22.380 --> 00:04:25.760
and that it's 90,000 square meters and that the stone, the,

81
00:04:25.960 --> 00:04:30.480
these pillars are 40 to 60 tons guys. The evidence is right in front of us,

82
00:04:30.670 --> 00:04:34.880
that the obviously had some sort of amazing technology that was at least on par

83
00:04:34.881 --> 00:04:38.080
with what we have today, or maybe more advanced. We don't know guys,

84
00:04:38.081 --> 00:04:39.480
you have to start researching the,

85
00:04:39.670 --> 00:04:44.190
this global cataly that there's overwhelming evidence that happened

86
00:04:44.191 --> 00:04:47.670
11,500 years ago. And, and another incident,

87
00:04:47.671 --> 00:04:49.230
12,700 years ago,

88
00:04:50.170 --> 00:04:55.030
you have to start asking yourself some questions here. This, what we have,

89
00:04:55.031 --> 00:04:56.950
what we were taught is not accurate.

90
00:04:57.100 --> 00:05:00.430
What is currently being taught to our children and as well as people at the

91
00:05:00.431 --> 00:05:03.620
university level is not accurate. Why is that?

92
00:05:03.840 --> 00:05:07.700
Why is it that the Turkish government has prevented any excavations for the last

93
00:05:07.701 --> 00:05:12.180
few years? Why guys, hello, wake up. We have the evidence right in front of us.

94
00:05:12.200 --> 00:05:15.380
And it's time that these questions start getting answered as far as why is the

95
00:05:15.381 --> 00:05:19.260
excavation not currently going on? Right. Anyways, this is Jimmy.

96
00:05:19.420 --> 00:05:21.970
I bright insight be style.
