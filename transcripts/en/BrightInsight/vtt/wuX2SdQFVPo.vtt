00:00:00.380 --> 00:00:05.040
<v 0>So, is it just me or is this whole world getting a bit crazy right now?</v>

2
00:00:05.240 --> 00:00:08.240
I wanna make this video about the golden rule as it's called,

3
00:00:08.340 --> 00:00:11.200
but before I get to that, let me share with you what brought me to, uh,

4
00:00:11.201 --> 00:00:15.120
being inspired to make this video. So about a week, week and a half ago,

5
00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:18.000
I was outta town for a wedding and I had a number of different,

6
00:00:18.110 --> 00:00:19.360
just great conversations,

7
00:00:19.361 --> 00:00:22.550
catching up with old friends and a bunch of different people there. And, uh,

8
00:00:22.570 --> 00:00:24.470
got to chatting with some people about how I'm making, you know,

9
00:00:24.471 --> 00:00:26.430
I'm doing a YouTube channel and I,

10
00:00:26.450 --> 00:00:29.310
one of the conversations that stood out and actually let me just mention that.

11
00:00:29.470 --> 00:00:33.190
I asked a number of different people, what it is they would say to humanity,

12
00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:36.950
like seven, if you had the audience of seven plus billion people right now,

13
00:00:37.250 --> 00:00:39.950
and you could say something to them, give a message. What would it be?

14
00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:42.180
And one of the, of conversations that stood out,

15
00:00:42.181 --> 00:00:44.540
and then we also mentioned that a lot of people said similar things like people

16
00:00:44.740 --> 00:00:45.700
need to be nicer to each other.

17
00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:48.860
People need to just stop freaking out about money. Uh,

18
00:00:48.861 --> 00:00:51.500
people talked about how this whole world is being controlled by the few,

19
00:00:51.501 --> 00:00:55.020
which stood out to me. Obviously, if you listen to my other videos &lt;laugh&gt; but,

20
00:00:55.180 --> 00:00:58.580
uh, one of the conversations that stood out was from the mother of the bride.

21
00:00:58.840 --> 00:01:01.460
And I had real nice candid conversation with her. And I asked her, look, we,

22
00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:04.810
if you could say anything to humanity, what would it be? And she said,

23
00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:08.250
literally people need to start being more kind to one another.

24
00:01:08.990 --> 00:01:12.650
And they got me thinking about the golden rule as it's commonly called,

25
00:01:12.670 --> 00:01:15.890
you know, treat people the way you wanna be treated, so to speak.

26
00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:20.850
And now when I was in my undergrad, I, I got my minor in religious studies,

27
00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:24.720
couple reasons needed a GPA booster. And I knew that a lot of these classes,

28
00:01:25.030 --> 00:01:27.920
according to rate my professor.com was like easy.

29
00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:31.000
As you could take a lot of 'em online and do discussion board posts.

30
00:01:31.080 --> 00:01:33.800
But that aside I learned a lot of things in the process. And I also took,

31
00:01:34.060 --> 00:01:35.760
wanted to take those classes, uh,

32
00:01:35.761 --> 00:01:38.800
because I just find it interesting that most of the world's population is

33
00:01:39.080 --> 00:01:43.830
religious. Now me personally, I'm not religious. I was raised CA I don't, I,

34
00:01:43.870 --> 00:01:46.510
I consider myself nonreligious. I'm a spiritual guy.

35
00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:50.510
I believe that we're spiritual beings inhabiting a body. And that essentially,

36
00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:53.310
I, I say that nature's my church and love is my religion.

37
00:01:53.530 --> 00:01:55.390
And I'm a seek of truth. And that there's a lot of,

38
00:01:55.420 --> 00:01:58.790
there's a lot of truths within religion, but there's a lot of things that,

39
00:01:59.170 --> 00:01:59.471
you know,

40
00:01:59.471 --> 00:02:02.870
the most common religions in the world just seem to omit or don't discuss, or,

41
00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:05.420
you know, so I'll just leave it at that. So you know where I'm coming from,

42
00:02:06.520 --> 00:02:09.100
but are you aware that the 13,

43
00:02:09.101 --> 00:02:12.180
most common religions in the world that the base,

44
00:02:12.320 --> 00:02:15.660
the most simplest foundation of every single one of least 13,

45
00:02:15.661 --> 00:02:18.260
most common religions is literally the golden rule.

46
00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:21.660
Now the all worded a little bit differently. And let me give you some examples,

47
00:02:21.661 --> 00:02:24.010
and I know that the print on there is a little bit too small all to see.

48
00:02:24.011 --> 00:02:26.130
So lemme bring you up this one that just shows nine of 'em.

49
00:02:26.350 --> 00:02:28.570
So you can see that they all have something similar. So Christianity,

50
00:02:28.630 --> 00:02:31.530
as an example, a quote, you know, from a straight from scripture is,

51
00:02:31.830 --> 00:02:33.410
and everything due to others,

52
00:02:33.550 --> 00:02:36.730
as you would have them do to you for this is the law of the prophets.

53
00:02:37.110 --> 00:02:38.450
So let's skip over to Judaism.

54
00:02:38.920 --> 00:02:43.490
What is hateful to you do not do to your neighbor. This is the whole of a Torah.

55
00:02:44.260 --> 00:02:47.040
All the rest is commentary, which I think is pretty interesting.

56
00:02:47.041 --> 00:02:49.360
If you think about it, it's saying that this is the most important thing, right?

57
00:02:50.040 --> 00:02:54.600
Hinduism. This is the sum of duty do not do to others.

58
00:02:54.670 --> 00:02:57.600
What would cause pain if done to you, Islam,

59
00:02:58.220 --> 00:03:01.080
not one of you truly believes until you wish for others.

60
00:03:01.350 --> 00:03:04.200
What you wish for yourself. That's from the prophet Muhammad,

61
00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:09.680
Buddhism treat not others in ways that you yourself would find hurtful.

62
00:03:09.681 --> 00:03:13.040
They all basically say the same thing that be nice to others,

63
00:03:13.590 --> 00:03:17.080
just as you want people to treat you and everything will be fine. And you know,

64
00:03:17.280 --> 00:03:21.070
you, you have like say the 10 command meant as an example or different rules and

65
00:03:21.190 --> 00:03:24.710
guidance that all these religions, uh, detail and outline that. Ultimately,

66
00:03:24.711 --> 00:03:27.470
if you just, ultimately, if you just follow the golden rule,

67
00:03:27.480 --> 00:03:31.870
everything works out. Right. But the problem in that, you know, so many people,

68
00:03:32.050 --> 00:03:34.070
you know, the world's population is religious. The,

69
00:03:34.071 --> 00:03:36.150
the percentage of this varies, I've tried to look, you know,

70
00:03:36.151 --> 00:03:38.750
most people believe in a divine being, not everyone's religious.

71
00:03:39.260 --> 00:03:43.740
So keep that in mind, but is it just me or do, are you,

72
00:03:43.920 --> 00:03:46.620
you must know people that are quote unquote religious.

73
00:03:47.220 --> 00:03:50.780
They don't seem to follow the golden rule on a, even close to a regular basis.

74
00:03:50.870 --> 00:03:52.300
Right? Even good people,

75
00:03:52.301 --> 00:03:55.380
people that you think very highly of you see that their egos get the better of

76
00:03:55.381 --> 00:03:59.100
them. Maybe more often than not. Right. And, and one of the, you know,

77
00:03:59.101 --> 00:04:03.570
one of the things it comes back to is a lot of people say respect is a two way

78
00:04:03.590 --> 00:04:07.610
street right now, what I'm saying right now, I myself have,

79
00:04:07.850 --> 00:04:10.650
have also like followed a significant majority of my life.

80
00:04:10.760 --> 00:04:13.530
Kind of saying the same thing. Like I believe being nice to others.

81
00:04:13.970 --> 00:04:15.130
There's been plenty of times where I've been nice to others.

82
00:04:15.131 --> 00:04:16.210
That weren't very nice to me,

83
00:04:16.550 --> 00:04:20.680
but there's been a whole bunch of times where others have crossed my path and I

84
00:04:20.830 --> 00:04:23.440
crossed it right back over to teach them right. Teach.

85
00:04:23.560 --> 00:04:26.520
'em a lesson when people cross you, you teach 'em that it's not nice. And,

86
00:04:27.160 --> 00:04:30.880
and you, and you shove it right back in their face. Right? So, uh, yeah,

87
00:04:30.881 --> 00:04:31.720
that doesn't work.

88
00:04:32.260 --> 00:04:35.480
The ego versus ego is an unwinnable battle that only causes more suffering.

89
00:04:35.580 --> 00:04:39.160
And I remember hearing back in the day, you know, people, you know, people say,

90
00:04:39.161 --> 00:04:41.030
look, you know, by being mean, there's only,

91
00:04:41.340 --> 00:04:44.070
it's hurting yourself in the process. And I always like, kind of laugh that off.

92
00:04:44.270 --> 00:04:46.110
I'm like, Hey, you know, or scoffed it off. Like, you know, well,

93
00:04:46.210 --> 00:04:48.910
that's just something people say to try and encourage others to be nice. Right.

94
00:04:49.770 --> 00:04:53.950
But think about that. When people cross you, when people disrespect, you,

95
00:04:54.630 --> 00:04:55.670
you do, you know what you're witnessing,

96
00:04:55.730 --> 00:04:58.990
you're witnessing a time capsule within them, within themselves,

97
00:04:59.200 --> 00:05:03.020
their own life experiences, because we're all a product of our experiences.

98
00:05:03.021 --> 00:05:05.980
And we've had millions, yes. Millions of life experiences.

99
00:05:06.160 --> 00:05:09.300
And what you're witnessing when someone treats you poorly is how others have

100
00:05:09.301 --> 00:05:14.300
treated them in the past. Think about that. Am I wrong when you reflect on it?

101
00:05:14.301 --> 00:05:15.660
You'll see just how true it really is.

102
00:05:15.810 --> 00:05:19.620
When you get to know people like there's been a couple people I've become very

103
00:05:19.621 --> 00:05:22.170
close friends with that. When we first met, we didn't really hit it off.

104
00:05:22.270 --> 00:05:24.850
Didn't really see eye to eye. And we kind of, weren't very nice to each other.

105
00:05:25.310 --> 00:05:27.330
And as we got to know each other, we realized that we all,

106
00:05:27.390 --> 00:05:29.690
we both had flaws within ourselves.

107
00:05:29.950 --> 00:05:32.370
And then we come from backgrounds that maybe, you know,

108
00:05:32.371 --> 00:05:34.930
we had certain life experiences where, you know,

109
00:05:35.750 --> 00:05:38.210
we felt we had been wronged and you, and you carry those things,

110
00:05:38.230 --> 00:05:42.010
but you it's a subconscious thing. Right? So when you start to realize,

111
00:05:42.110 --> 00:05:46.200
when you become aware, as I say that I am now that I'm, I'm aware, I'm awakened.

112
00:05:46.340 --> 00:05:48.520
So to speak. I mean, every day is, uh, I'm.

113
00:05:48.640 --> 00:05:50.120
I feel like I'm waking up more and more every day,

114
00:05:50.300 --> 00:05:53.240
but you get to this point where you start to figure out what the underlying

115
00:05:53.241 --> 00:05:56.840
issue with humanity is, is that say these 13, most common religions,

116
00:05:57.260 --> 00:06:01.760
how many of them discuss in detail to their followers? The ego, the,

117
00:06:01.761 --> 00:06:04.360
the workings of the human brain, that essentially guys,

118
00:06:04.380 --> 00:06:07.680
we are an animal species. And just like any other animal species,

119
00:06:07.780 --> 00:06:09.840
we have personality, characteristics.

120
00:06:10.460 --> 00:06:14.360
And part of the ego has to do with denial projection that like, you know,

121
00:06:14.361 --> 00:06:17.190
when people judge others, for example, which is something human do all the time,

122
00:06:17.380 --> 00:06:20.390
even if they don't do it out loud and talk crap about others behind their back,

123
00:06:20.590 --> 00:06:23.270
they in their brain, they'll in their thoughts. They'll think, you know, oh,

124
00:06:23.271 --> 00:06:25.390
look at that person. Look what they're wearing. Look what they're doing.

125
00:06:25.540 --> 00:06:28.510
Look how that person reacted to that. Wow. Why would they behave that way?

126
00:06:30.090 --> 00:06:34.150
It is my belief that we all are just operating based on the experiences that we

127
00:06:34.151 --> 00:06:38.900
had and that, because we've walked in our individual shoes for our entire lives,

128
00:06:39.640 --> 00:06:42.700
no one can truly appreciate you. No. Or,

129
00:06:42.940 --> 00:06:46.020
or the experiences that you've had and why you act certain way in certain

130
00:06:46.021 --> 00:06:46.854
circumstances.

131
00:06:47.480 --> 00:06:51.060
And that essentially going back to the ego that we weren't,

132
00:06:51.061 --> 00:06:53.300
most of us weren't trained, we weren't trained in school about this.

133
00:06:53.301 --> 00:06:56.700
We weren't trained religions. We don't, our politicians don't discuss it. Uh,

134
00:06:57.040 --> 00:07:01.050
the new media doesn't discuss the ego and how we can train ourselves to identify

135
00:07:01.051 --> 00:07:06.050
that, you know, when people are behaving like, like, like hard,

136
00:07:06.190 --> 00:07:07.050
excuse my language.

137
00:07:07.050 --> 00:07:10.770
But just trying to cater to every bit of all my audience &lt;laugh&gt;, uh,

138
00:07:10.771 --> 00:07:13.210
that essentially you're witnessing how they've been treated by others.

139
00:07:13.550 --> 00:07:17.290
And they have, they're just oblivious to it. Looking back on my own life.

140
00:07:17.450 --> 00:07:21.040
And the times that I've treated others poorly, I, man,

141
00:07:21.200 --> 00:07:23.440
I didn't think I was treating others poorly. I thought I was justified.

142
00:07:24.140 --> 00:07:27.280
I'm telling them this because of what they just said or did to me.

143
00:07:27.460 --> 00:07:29.920
So they need to know that respect is a two way street.

144
00:07:30.260 --> 00:07:33.240
And if you're gonna treat me poorly now, you know how what's gonna happen? Like,

145
00:07:33.630 --> 00:07:37.920
like looking back, how much suffering did I cause others, how many,

146
00:07:37.940 --> 00:07:42.710
how much suffer has any of us caused others by simply responding to their own

147
00:07:42.850 --> 00:07:46.470
ego? Right. And, and how did it, did it ever work out good?

148
00:07:47.020 --> 00:07:51.550
Even if at the time someone crossed you unjustly and you crossed them back and

149
00:07:51.551 --> 00:07:53.070
you get the win over them, essentially, you,

150
00:07:53.071 --> 00:07:55.590
you overpower their personality and you, I don't know,

151
00:07:55.591 --> 00:07:58.990
you shot them up or whatever. Um, did you feel good about in long term,

152
00:07:59.540 --> 00:08:00.181
couldn't you,

153
00:08:00.181 --> 00:08:04.180
isn't there like a subconscious part of you that realized that that person was

154
00:08:04.181 --> 00:08:07.460
having a really weak moment and you pounded them

155
00:08:08.610 --> 00:08:10.060
basically where I'm going with this.

156
00:08:10.320 --> 00:08:13.340
And going back to my friend's mother who says the whole world needs to be more

157
00:08:13.341 --> 00:08:14.660
kind to one another guys,

158
00:08:14.840 --> 00:08:18.580
you are not helping this world by giving,

159
00:08:18.840 --> 00:08:21.770
by treating poorly and responding to their own ego or,

160
00:08:21.830 --> 00:08:26.410
or choosing to be of the philosophy. That respect is a two-way street.

161
00:08:27.240 --> 00:08:29.450
That for this role to change, it takes all of us.

162
00:08:29.730 --> 00:08:32.770
And that you need to be the change that you wanna be in the world. Right?

163
00:08:33.570 --> 00:08:35.170
Think about that. It only takes critical mass.

164
00:08:35.270 --> 00:08:39.170
I'm not suggesting here that 7 billion people need to start being nice.

165
00:08:39.450 --> 00:08:41.320
Cuz I know that doesn, it's not gonna work like that.

166
00:08:42.080 --> 00:08:45.840
There there's a sense of balance in the universe that as above so below that

167
00:08:45.841 --> 00:08:48.320
there is an opposite to everything. So you're gonna have nice people.

168
00:08:48.321 --> 00:08:49.920
You're gonna have unhappy people, angry people,

169
00:08:50.660 --> 00:08:55.530
but you can have enough people choosing to treat others

170
00:08:55.590 --> 00:08:59.170
the way you would like to be treated. Even when you come across as a jerk,

171
00:08:59.171 --> 00:09:03.250
like have you ever been the person to maybe cross somebody else? You,

172
00:09:03.310 --> 00:09:07.210
you were in a heaven, a moment you've had a bad day. You kind of, I don't know.

173
00:09:08.690 --> 00:09:12.290
&lt;laugh&gt;, we're rude to somebody unknowingly by accident. You, you know,

174
00:09:12.590 --> 00:09:15.600
and it's hard because this is part of the denial thing. You know,

175
00:09:15.601 --> 00:09:17.320
people don't wanna believe that they've crossed others.

176
00:09:17.321 --> 00:09:19.120
They don't wanna believe that they have been at fault.

177
00:09:19.390 --> 00:09:22.480
It's part of the human brain guys. This is like the workings of it. I,

178
00:09:22.600 --> 00:09:26.560
I say that it's the software of the hardware. Our brain's the hardware egos,

179
00:09:26.640 --> 00:09:28.720
the software that denials a hell of a thing.

180
00:09:28.940 --> 00:09:32.160
And most of this world thinks that they're perfectly good people and have done

181
00:09:32.180 --> 00:09:35.670
no wrong. Yet. Most of this world has wrong. Others.

182
00:09:36.030 --> 00:09:38.150
It's just part of the human, uh, psyche.

183
00:09:38.151 --> 00:09:40.910
It's part of the game that we're in and that we're all screwing over other

184
00:09:40.911 --> 00:09:45.590
people. And some of us just do it more than others. So we project, we think, oh,

185
00:09:45.591 --> 00:09:48.390
well this person does it worse than I do. So, you know,

186
00:09:48.900 --> 00:09:50.230
they need to worry about it. Not me.

187
00:09:51.170 --> 00:09:56.020
So the long story short is that the awareness of that look

188
00:09:57.380 --> 00:09:59.860
Nama, stay realizing that what's in others is in you.

189
00:10:00.480 --> 00:10:05.380
The ability for you to be angry with other people based on their actions is

190
00:10:05.381 --> 00:10:09.420
because something within what they did their actions is in with you is in you as

191
00:10:09.421 --> 00:10:11.020
well that you are capable of it.

192
00:10:11.360 --> 00:10:14.460
And maybe you've done those negative actions in the past. I'm very,

193
00:10:14.461 --> 00:10:16.490
I'm speaking very philosophical from, uh,

194
00:10:16.491 --> 00:10:19.410
from a very philosophical standpoint right now. So I hope you're with me.

195
00:10:19.411 --> 00:10:22.210
And I hope this is making sense, cuz this is completely unscripted.

196
00:10:22.870 --> 00:10:23.970
So to close this up,

197
00:10:24.480 --> 00:10:27.490
reflect on the times that you have wronged others and others have wronged you

198
00:10:27.910 --> 00:10:29.970
and think about how in the future, moving forward,

199
00:10:30.470 --> 00:10:35.210
you can help make this world a better place by actually living the golden rule.

200
00:10:35.760 --> 00:10:40.400
That when cross you say something like, thank you. Like if someone disrespects,

201
00:10:40.401 --> 00:10:42.320
you says something rude, just say, thank you.

202
00:10:42.540 --> 00:10:44.120
You'll be amazed at how people will react.

203
00:10:44.220 --> 00:10:47.080
It will often bring them back to planet earth. &lt;laugh&gt; they'll realize,

204
00:10:47.081 --> 00:10:48.960
wait a second. Anyways, I'll leave it at that.

205
00:10:48.961 --> 00:10:52.040
I just wanna give you all something to think about, but uh, I'm Jimmy,
