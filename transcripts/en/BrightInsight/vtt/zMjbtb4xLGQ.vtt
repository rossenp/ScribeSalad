00:00:00.540 --> 00:00:05.120
<v 0>The true history of ancient human civilization is far older and was once far</v>

2
00:00:05.121 --> 00:00:08.760
more advanced than we were ever taught in school. And in this video,

3
00:00:09.060 --> 00:00:12.040
I'm gonna tie together three examples that prove that one,

4
00:00:12.760 --> 00:00:16.960
the true age of ancient human civilization is far older by more than double than

5
00:00:16.961 --> 00:00:19.560
that, of what the textbooks have taught us two,

6
00:00:19.561 --> 00:00:23.830
that there was a massive global cataly that happened on earth when human

7
00:00:23.831 --> 00:00:24.990
civilization was around.

8
00:00:25.530 --> 00:00:29.070
And it was essentially a total reset button for human civilization.

9
00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:34.030
That mankind was obliterated back into the stone age and had to start

10
00:00:34.130 --> 00:00:35.110
all over from scratch.

11
00:00:35.690 --> 00:00:39.830
And the third example proves that not only were we alive at the time of the

12
00:00:39.890 --> 00:00:40.610
cataly,

13
00:00:40.610 --> 00:00:45.340
but we somehow had the intellectual knowledge and capabilities to build a

14
00:00:45.341 --> 00:00:49.940
massive network of more than 200 underground cities that are completely

15
00:00:49.941 --> 00:00:53.060
unexplainable by scientists, archeologists, and historians.

16
00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:55.100
Some of which are hundreds of feet underground,

17
00:00:55.370 --> 00:01:00.300
more than 11 levels deep have advanced air ventilation systems and architecture

18
00:01:00.450 --> 00:01:03.850
that have complet dumbfounded modern engineers.

19
00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:06.130
Now I do have a video on the cataly,

20
00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:09.730
but let me give you just a few key pieces of evidence that prove this,

21
00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:13.890
that include the most recent and technologically advanced scientific data ever

22
00:01:13.891 --> 00:01:15.690
taken. For example,

23
00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:20.170
ice core samples taken from both Antarctica as well as Greenland prove that

24
00:01:20.171 --> 00:01:24.160
there was two massive. The first that happened approximately

25
00:01:26.080 --> 00:01:28.880
12,980 years ago, and the second 1400 years later,

26
00:01:29.140 --> 00:01:31.200
or 11,600 years ago,

27
00:01:31.430 --> 00:01:36.200
that showed that there was a sudden rapid and massive 400 foot rise

28
00:01:36.220 --> 00:01:37.120
in global sea levels,

29
00:01:37.370 --> 00:01:41.360
which may have even have been 30 feet in the first 24 hour period of whatever

30
00:01:41.361 --> 00:01:46.070
this event was. It also shows a 15 degree Fahrenheit temperature swing,

31
00:01:46.240 --> 00:01:49.710
which is incredible because when you consider that global warming and climate

32
00:01:49.711 --> 00:01:52.550
change debates right now are focused on what will happen if there's a three

33
00:01:52.551 --> 00:01:54.430
degree Fahrenheit temperature increase. Well,

34
00:01:54.431 --> 00:01:57.270
this is five times that also at that same time,

35
00:01:57.271 --> 00:02:01.790
there was a massive extinction level event that killed off more than 75% of all

36
00:02:01.810 --> 00:02:06.260
mamals in north America, including 120 species of megafauna,

37
00:02:06.270 --> 00:02:08.620
which are animals larger than 100 pounds.

38
00:02:09.170 --> 00:02:11.460
Most of which you've probably never seen or heard of before,

39
00:02:11.520 --> 00:02:13.220
but they're absolutely incredible.

40
00:02:13.850 --> 00:02:17.100
Another key piece of evidence that happened at the same period of time is a

41
00:02:17.101 --> 00:02:18.660
mysterious black matte layer,

42
00:02:18.810 --> 00:02:22.820
similar to the KT boundary that killed off the dinosaur as evidence of an

43
00:02:22.821 --> 00:02:23.850
asteroid impact act.

44
00:02:24.320 --> 00:02:27.810
This covers over 50 million square kilometers of the Earth's surface,

45
00:02:28.230 --> 00:02:32.450
nearly 25% of all the land mass and evidence of it is found over three

46
00:02:32.451 --> 00:02:34.850
continents in dozens of countries around the world.

47
00:02:35.400 --> 00:02:40.330
This black mat layer includes Iridium nano diamonds, extraterrestrial helium,

48
00:02:40.540 --> 00:02:44.800
which is all evidence of a cosmic impact that a comment or an as hit planet

49
00:02:44.810 --> 00:02:48.400
earth, but it's completely mysterious because nobody has found the crater.

50
00:02:48.400 --> 00:02:50.000
That would be the result of it. However,

51
00:02:50.070 --> 00:02:54.000
this would explain the rapid end to the last ice age that all happened at the

52
00:02:54.001 --> 00:02:58.040
same period of time that essentially a commod or an asteroid hit the north

53
00:02:58.280 --> 00:03:01.920
American ice shelf, which at the time was more than one mile thick of ice.

54
00:03:02.180 --> 00:03:04.120
And in some places more than two miles thick.

55
00:03:04.460 --> 00:03:06.400
And if an asteroid was to hit that ice shelf,

56
00:03:06.460 --> 00:03:11.040
it would have caused a massive fine of a tremendous amount of ice,

57
00:03:11.300 --> 00:03:16.080
as well as vaporizing a significant amount of water into the atmosphere

58
00:03:16.081 --> 00:03:20.310
only to be rained down over the entire P planet for days and weeks to come,

59
00:03:20.520 --> 00:03:25.070
which completely corresponds with the data taken from Antarctica in Greenland on

60
00:03:25.230 --> 00:03:26.070
opposite sides of the planet.

61
00:03:26.100 --> 00:03:29.270
That show that there was a massive 400 foot rise in sea level,

62
00:03:29.530 --> 00:03:31.310
and nobody can figure out how this happened.

63
00:03:31.490 --> 00:03:36.390
Nobody has an explanation as to why the last ice age ended so rapidly.

64
00:03:36.650 --> 00:03:39.740
And so suddenly now this leads to me into my second point,

65
00:03:39.830 --> 00:03:44.060
which is at the true age of human civilization is at least double than what we

66
00:03:44.061 --> 00:03:48.420
were taught in the textbooks as evidenced by the site of go Beckley Tepe located

67
00:03:48.440 --> 00:03:49.273
in Turkey.

68
00:03:49.610 --> 00:03:53.940
This site is dated at at least 11,600 years old,

69
00:03:54.560 --> 00:03:58.860
and it is completely mysterious. Nobody knows who built it, why or how,

70
00:03:59.710 --> 00:04:02.610
but it is more than 7,000 years older than Stonehenge,

71
00:04:02.611 --> 00:04:04.650
which is largely mysterious in and of itself.

72
00:04:05.070 --> 00:04:09.730
And it is also 50 times larger and only 5% of it has been excavated.

73
00:04:10.030 --> 00:04:14.050
But ground penetrating radar has shown that so much of the site still remains

74
00:04:14.051 --> 00:04:17.050
underground. It contains more than 200 pillars.

75
00:04:17.080 --> 00:04:21.960
Some of which range from 20 to 50 tons in the site itself clearly

76
00:04:22.020 --> 00:04:23.600
has a celestial orientation.

77
00:04:24.020 --> 00:04:28.560
And what makes it even more interesting is that as the world's very first north,

78
00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:31.880
south facing structure, but it's lined perfectly north,

79
00:04:31.881 --> 00:04:34.760
which is completely unexplainable because there was no way to do that.

80
00:04:34.761 --> 00:04:39.000
Even a modern times without having advanced astronomical knowledge also found at

81
00:04:39.001 --> 00:04:41.510
this site is evidence of agriculture,

82
00:04:41.520 --> 00:04:44.670
which wasn't supposed to exist until nearly 6,000 years later,

83
00:04:44.930 --> 00:04:48.670
by the Sumerians in Mesopotamia, also known as the cradle of civilization.

84
00:04:49.180 --> 00:04:53.470
This site in itself completely debunks what we were taught in our textbooks and

85
00:04:53.471 --> 00:04:57.150
that the true narrative of ancient human civilization is far older and far more

86
00:04:57.151 --> 00:05:00.470
complicated than we ever realized. Now go Beckley tap a,

87
00:05:00.471 --> 00:05:04.020
which is been in Turkey. As I mentioned, leads me into my third example,

88
00:05:04.310 --> 00:05:09.100
which is that there is a network of more than 200 underground cities also

89
00:05:09.250 --> 00:05:11.700
located in Turkey and the captia region.

90
00:05:12.520 --> 00:05:15.620
The first thing that must be mentioned about these cities is that every

91
00:05:15.940 --> 00:05:16.221
scientist,

92
00:05:16.221 --> 00:05:20.940
archeologists and historian all agrees that they are completely mysterious,

93
00:05:21.850 --> 00:05:25.330
have no idea when they were built, who built them, why?

94
00:05:25.750 --> 00:05:28.410
And especially how, and like I said earlier,

95
00:05:28.710 --> 00:05:32.730
modern engineers are completely baffled that they had the intellectual knowledge

96
00:05:33.030 --> 00:05:35.810
to strategically build them in the ways that they did that.

97
00:05:35.811 --> 00:05:40.290
Essentially they carved around volcanic stone and even knew strategically where

98
00:05:40.291 --> 00:05:44.280
to place specific pillars in order to ensure the stability of the complex.

99
00:05:44.620 --> 00:05:48.520
And they have found zero evidence of any Kans whatsoever,

100
00:05:48.570 --> 00:05:52.200
which is pretty incredible. Let me give you the example of Darren Q U,

101
00:05:52.201 --> 00:05:55.120
which is the most notable of these underground cities. Now,

102
00:05:55.121 --> 00:05:57.280
this site has not been fully excavated.

103
00:05:57.470 --> 00:06:00.680
They don't know exactly how deep it is or how many levels, however,

104
00:06:01.040 --> 00:06:05.320
national geographic states that has 11 and that it also has an advanced air

105
00:06:05.321 --> 00:06:09.560
ventilation system that consists of more than 50 main shats that plummet more

106
00:06:09.561 --> 00:06:12.320
than 200 feet into the earth or more than 55 meters.

107
00:06:12.940 --> 00:06:17.630
And it also has more than 15,000 sub shats that stem from the 50 main shafts

108
00:06:17.660 --> 00:06:21.070
that they know of the entire site of itself is huge.

109
00:06:21.530 --> 00:06:25.790
It spans across more than four square miles or 10.4 kilometers. And like I said,

110
00:06:25.791 --> 00:06:27.230
it has not been fully excavated.

111
00:06:28.250 --> 00:06:32.950
It also connects to a nearby city through a eight kilometer or five mile long

112
00:06:32.951 --> 00:06:36.790
tunnel, carved out a volcanic rock, more than three stories underground.

113
00:06:37.360 --> 00:06:38.260
It has hundreds,

114
00:06:38.280 --> 00:06:42.860
if not thousands of rooms and was capable of holding more than 20,000 people

115
00:06:43.360 --> 00:06:47.340
and livestock comfortably, which is completely mind boggling,

116
00:06:47.660 --> 00:06:50.380
considering that out of these 200 known underground cities,

117
00:06:50.690 --> 00:06:55.060
more than 40 of them have at least three levels or more some of which have at

118
00:06:55.061 --> 00:06:58.490
least 10 levels that they know of. And they EV even have communication,

119
00:06:58.590 --> 00:07:01.410
piping holes connecting from various levels to another.

120
00:07:01.590 --> 00:07:03.330
So that way people can communicate in them.

121
00:07:03.870 --> 00:07:05.930
And they also have a system of locking doors,

122
00:07:06.200 --> 00:07:11.170
essentially 1100 pound rolling doors that could be operated by one person that

123
00:07:11.171 --> 00:07:12.730
would prevent anyone from the outside.

124
00:07:12.730 --> 00:07:16.610
Being able to get in which many historians in archeologists have stated that

125
00:07:16.611 --> 00:07:20.840
maybe the reason why these UN of ground cities were built were to avoid Raiders

126
00:07:20.841 --> 00:07:22.600
and invaders to their, to their area,

127
00:07:22.930 --> 00:07:26.480
which is pretty illogic considering that there's more than 200 of these cities.

128
00:07:26.940 --> 00:07:30.440
In fact, there's a city located 2200 kilometers away,

129
00:07:30.441 --> 00:07:34.400
nearly 1400 miles in Iran known as the new Chabad underground city.

130
00:07:34.460 --> 00:07:37.160
And if you look at photos of it, which I'll throw a couple up here for you,

131
00:07:37.540 --> 00:07:39.190
it looks like it was built the same people.

132
00:07:39.900 --> 00:07:42.790
This could also explain the mysterious city of Petra,

133
00:07:42.880 --> 00:07:44.830
which is more well known for having been in the movie,

134
00:07:44.831 --> 00:07:48.950
Indiana Jones in the last crusade, but it is completely unexplainable.

135
00:07:48.951 --> 00:07:50.990
They don't know who built it. And even just a year ago,

136
00:07:50.991 --> 00:07:52.750
they found a whole other entrance to it.

137
00:07:52.890 --> 00:07:55.150
And it may have held as many as 20,000 people,

138
00:07:56.040 --> 00:07:59.660
which reminds me some of these underground cities located it in Turkey.

139
00:08:00.300 --> 00:08:04.100
We're capable of holding more than 60,000 people for months on end.

140
00:08:04.101 --> 00:08:06.220
According to estimates, again,

141
00:08:06.280 --> 00:08:09.700
to think that these were made just to stay away from invaders is incredibly

142
00:08:09.701 --> 00:08:10.534
illogical.

143
00:08:10.590 --> 00:08:14.620
Isn't it far more likely that we somehow had the intellectual knowledge and the

144
00:08:14.820 --> 00:08:17.580
physical capabilities to build these sites,

145
00:08:17.610 --> 00:08:20.410
knowing that there was a cataly coming. Because again,

146
00:08:20.830 --> 00:08:22.650
we have no idea who built them or when,

147
00:08:22.950 --> 00:08:27.170
and now that we know that the history of human civilization is far older and was

148
00:08:27.171 --> 00:08:29.970
once far, far more advanced than what our textbooks have actually told us.

149
00:08:30.440 --> 00:08:34.930
It's time that we start asking new questions and start piecing together key

150
00:08:34.931 --> 00:08:39.210
pieces of evidence so that we can come up with far more logical explanations to

151
00:08:39.211 --> 00:08:42.560
the true history, human civilization. So to close this up,

152
00:08:42.820 --> 00:08:44.880
we know that because of go Backley Tepe,

153
00:08:45.060 --> 00:08:48.320
the history of human civilization is at least double the age than that,

154
00:08:48.321 --> 00:08:49.600
of what we were taught in the textbooks.

155
00:08:50.060 --> 00:08:53.480
We know that they also had advanced knowledge and that will take in for a case

156
00:08:53.710 --> 00:08:57.760
agriculture as well as the perfect north south facing shows that we were

157
00:08:57.761 --> 00:09:00.760
essentially ahead of ourselves and what we thought we were capable of by at

158
00:09:00.761 --> 00:09:02.840
least 6,000 years. And because of this,

159
00:09:02.860 --> 00:09:06.880
we know that we were alive at the precise time of a massive cataly when there

160
00:09:06.881 --> 00:09:10.320
just so happens to be a network of more than 200 underground tunnels,

161
00:09:10.450 --> 00:09:13.800
which to me seems like some type of arc system for survival.

162
00:09:14.060 --> 00:09:16.030
And when you tie these three things together,

163
00:09:16.330 --> 00:09:19.630
the most logical explanation is that yes, humans were alive.

164
00:09:19.730 --> 00:09:23.670
We were more advanced and we were essentially wiped out anyways, guys,

165
00:09:23.740 --> 00:09:26.670
