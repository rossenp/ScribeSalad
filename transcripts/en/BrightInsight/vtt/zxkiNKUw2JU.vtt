00:00:01.890 --> 00:00:06.690
<v 0>Ancient human civilization was far older and far more advanced than we were ever</v>

2
00:00:06.691 --> 00:00:08.280
taught in school. In fact,

3
00:00:08.281 --> 00:00:12.870
we were so advanced that whoever built the great pyramid of Giza somehow knew

4
00:00:12.871 --> 00:00:17.760
precisely just how big planet earth was to such a precise degree

5
00:00:17.761 --> 00:00:22.110
of accuracy that we were not able to achieve until 1972,

6
00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:25.980
following satellite measurements and mapping. And if you don't believe me,

7
00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:29.970
I have the data to prove it. And I'll share that with you in just a moment. Now,

8
00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:33.540
if you've seen my other videos on ancient human civilization or the pyramids,

9
00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:36.240
I've discussed interesting facts such as that,

10
00:00:36.241 --> 00:00:40.800
the great pyramid of Giza just so happens to be located at the exact

11
00:00:40.801 --> 00:00:45.150
geographical center of all landmass of planet earth. But I mean,

12
00:00:45.151 --> 00:00:48.150
do you think that that's a coincidence? I mean, what are the odds of that,

13
00:00:48.330 --> 00:00:52.590
that the biggest and most mysterious structure in the history of mankind just so

14
00:00:52.591 --> 00:00:56.880
happens to be located in the one spot on planet earth that is unique in of

15
00:00:56.881 --> 00:00:57.714
itself.

16
00:00:57.780 --> 00:01:01.290
I also discussed the fact that the great pyramid of Giza has eight sides.

17
00:01:01.291 --> 00:01:03.420
Not for most people are not aware of this.

18
00:01:03.421 --> 00:01:07.200
It's very subtle and it's only a parent at dusk and Dawn on the spring and

19
00:01:07.201 --> 00:01:08.310
autumn equinoxes.

20
00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:12.420
I also discussed the fact that the pyramids lack sit residue from candles and

21
00:01:12.421 --> 00:01:13.470
torches. I mean,

22
00:01:13.471 --> 00:01:17.040
how were they able to eliminate these structures while they were being built or

23
00:01:17.041 --> 00:01:20.610
afterwards, I even use the example of the Sistine chapel,

24
00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:25.290
which was built thousands of years after the pyramids of Egypt yet years and

25
00:01:25.291 --> 00:01:29.670
years of restoration was required to remove centuries of residue from candles

26
00:01:29.671 --> 00:01:34.260
and torches. So why on earth did the Sistine chapel require candlelight yet?

27
00:01:34.261 --> 00:01:35.970
The pyramids didn't. I mean,

28
00:01:35.971 --> 00:01:39.180
I even use the example and take the picture on the right of it's in Egypt,

29
00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:44.070
that some people say depicts a light bulb or some sort of technical device

30
00:01:44.071 --> 00:01:45.300
involving electricity. I mean,

31
00:01:45.301 --> 00:01:48.210
you can see the snake and it connects to the Lotus flower,

32
00:01:48.211 --> 00:01:51.660
which also connects seemingly to a cord that goes to a box. I mean,

33
00:01:51.661 --> 00:01:52.494
what is this?

34
00:01:52.800 --> 00:01:56.520
I also discussed the incredible shaft and tunnel system located throughout the

35
00:01:56.521 --> 00:01:57.510
Giza plateau.

36
00:01:57.750 --> 00:02:01.260
There are dozens of shafts that plumb it over a hundred feet down and they're

37
00:02:01.261 --> 00:02:03.570
dug into solid limestone bedrock.

38
00:02:03.810 --> 00:02:06.870
And these photos don't even include the horizontal shafts and tunnels that go

39
00:02:06.871 --> 00:02:09.750
into the Giza plateau, which is a great mystery. I mean,

40
00:02:09.751 --> 00:02:12.090
what were these used for now in my videos,

41
00:02:12.091 --> 00:02:15.630
one of the things I like to discuss is the fact that ancient humans seemingly

42
00:02:15.631 --> 00:02:19.980
had some sort of advanced technology to be able to cut the stone and lift them.

43
00:02:20.310 --> 00:02:22.020
However many people disagree with this.

44
00:02:22.021 --> 00:02:26.760
And the site's awesome examples on how primitive methods can absolutely be

45
00:02:26.761 --> 00:02:29.670
utilized to cut and lift stones. For example,

46
00:02:29.671 --> 00:02:34.050
you have string saws as well as bronze saws that can be utilized with sand and

47
00:02:34.051 --> 00:02:37.710
water to cut through granite basalt and even court site. So,

48
00:02:37.711 --> 00:02:42.540
no you do not need advanced machinery or any type of cutting systems to cut

49
00:02:42.541 --> 00:02:45.900
through these hard stones. But there's a massive issue with this theory,

50
00:02:46.050 --> 00:02:50.280
which is the fact that it takes so unbelievably long to cut through even just

51
00:02:50.281 --> 00:02:51.750
one stone. In fact,

52
00:02:51.751 --> 00:02:54.660
it's pretty interesting that most of the demonstrations that you can find videos

53
00:02:54.661 --> 00:02:57.480
of don't even show the completion of these stones,

54
00:02:57.660 --> 00:03:00.790
they cut a few inches into it. Give up just to prove to you that yes,

55
00:03:00.791 --> 00:03:02.830
it's possible to cut through these stones,

56
00:03:03.010 --> 00:03:07.600
but explain to me how string saws or bronze saws can cut the unbelievably

57
00:03:07.601 --> 00:03:11.890
unique curvatures of many of these stones found throughout Egypt or how these

58
00:03:11.891 --> 00:03:15.280
methods could possibly cut 90 degree angles. We're in modern times,

59
00:03:15.340 --> 00:03:19.510
stonemasons need diamond bit drills in routers to do any of these angles that

60
00:03:19.511 --> 00:03:21.850
you're seeing here. I mean, even take, for example,

61
00:03:21.851 --> 00:03:25.270
the 100 ton stone boxes found at the CRPM in Egypt.

62
00:03:25.690 --> 00:03:28.090
These boxes are more than 10 feet tall,

63
00:03:28.120 --> 00:03:33.070
15 feet long in way combined total of 100 tons of piece 30

64
00:03:33.071 --> 00:03:36.490
tons for the solid lid and 70 tons for the box.

65
00:03:36.730 --> 00:03:40.210
But what makes it even more interesting is that their machine cut somehow to a

66
00:03:40.211 --> 00:03:45.130
level of accuracy to within two, 10 thousands of an inch. I mean,

67
00:03:45.131 --> 00:03:50.050
how could string size or bronze saws that utilized sand cut something so

68
00:03:50.051 --> 00:03:50.831
massive? I mean,

69
00:03:50.831 --> 00:03:54.820
that's one thing these boxes are humongous or the fact that they're so

70
00:03:54.850 --> 00:03:56.830
unbelievably level. I mean,

71
00:03:56.831 --> 00:04:00.940
can you demonstrate a string saw doing something to this level of accuracy to 10

72
00:04:00.941 --> 00:04:01.990
thousands of an inch,

73
00:04:02.200 --> 00:04:05.710
but that brings me to another question involving the logistics. I mean,

74
00:04:05.711 --> 00:04:10.150
how can these primitive methods been utilized to do tens of millions of stone

75
00:04:10.151 --> 00:04:14.200
blocks found throughout pyramids structures and in statutes throughout ancient

76
00:04:14.201 --> 00:04:18.010
Egypt? I mean, there are at least 88,

77
00:04:18.010 --> 00:04:20.890
0 pyramids known to exist within Egypt alone.

78
00:04:21.040 --> 00:04:23.830
Most people aren't aware of that there are of course are familiar with the three

79
00:04:23.831 --> 00:04:26.860
largest, the most popular, which are the pyramids of Giza,

80
00:04:27.220 --> 00:04:29.200
but there are others being found all the time. I mean,

81
00:04:29.230 --> 00:04:30.520
even in March of this year,

82
00:04:30.521 --> 00:04:35.260
they found an entirely new pyramid buried in ruins underneath the sands of Egypt

83
00:04:35.500 --> 00:04:37.780
or even the Abu rewash pyramid,

84
00:04:37.781 --> 00:04:42.580
which appears to be exploded in chart and is just completely mysterious on what

85
00:04:42.581 --> 00:04:44.830
the heck happened to that pyramid. But I mean,

86
00:04:44.831 --> 00:04:47.620
what on earth happened to any pyramid for them to be in ruins?

87
00:04:47.740 --> 00:04:51.490
Why are they finding destroyed pyramids underneath the sands of Egypt?

88
00:04:51.760 --> 00:04:53.950
What on earth would it take to destroy a pyramid?

89
00:04:54.220 --> 00:04:57.910
But when you take into account that the great pyramid of Giza in itself has

90
00:04:57.911 --> 00:05:01.600
2.3 million stone blocks. Show me,

91
00:05:01.601 --> 00:05:05.500
be finding thousands of discarded worn out, uh,

92
00:05:06.020 --> 00:05:10.090
bronze saws throughout Egypt. Yet we've only found what a few, several effects.

93
00:05:10.540 --> 00:05:12.910
So these primitive methods don't stack up. Yes,

94
00:05:12.911 --> 00:05:15.730
it's possible to cut through these stones with these primitive methods,

95
00:05:15.940 --> 00:05:19.960
but it doesn't compute if we're being told that ancient human civilization and

96
00:05:19.961 --> 00:05:23.170
the first pyramids were built approximately 4,200 years ago,

97
00:05:23.350 --> 00:05:26.110
if every single person alive at that time was working on this,

98
00:05:26.230 --> 00:05:29.290
they would still be working to complete all of these tens of millions of stone

99
00:05:29.291 --> 00:05:32.440
blocks found throughout Egypt. And they're still finding new ones all the time.

100
00:05:32.560 --> 00:05:35.350
Now let me touch on the issue of lifting these stones.

101
00:05:35.351 --> 00:05:38.710
Now I have seen other primitive methods, which are incredible by the way, take,

102
00:05:38.711 --> 00:05:40.600
for example, Wally from Michigan,

103
00:05:40.601 --> 00:05:44.650
you can see this video where he lifts a 20 ton stone block all by himself.

104
00:05:44.650 --> 00:05:45.670
It's incredible,

105
00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:50.980
but explain to me and let me cite the example of the massive 1000 ton stones

106
00:05:51.040 --> 00:05:54.760
of ball back in Lebanon, located near the temple of Jupiter. I mean,

107
00:05:54.761 --> 00:05:59.480
how on earth do they move a 1000 ton stone block over a

108
00:05:59.481 --> 00:06:02.960
half mile uphill? How on earth did they do that?

109
00:06:03.500 --> 00:06:06.920
And not to mention the three blocks that they lifted up over 30 feet up and

110
00:06:07.220 --> 00:06:09.770
placed on top of other stones. I mean, yeah, sure.

111
00:06:09.800 --> 00:06:11.720
People can lift individual stones,

112
00:06:11.721 --> 00:06:14.750
but how do you drag a thousand ton stone uphill? I mean,

113
00:06:14.751 --> 00:06:16.790
that really raises some serious questions,

114
00:06:16.940 --> 00:06:19.700
but let me go back to Egypt and use the example of the Syrian. I mean,

115
00:06:19.701 --> 00:06:24.620
you have 60 to 70 ton stone blocks at peace that are more than 10 feet

116
00:06:24.621 --> 00:06:25.401
tall. I mean,

117
00:06:25.401 --> 00:06:28.710
these pictures do not do it justice because if you had a person standing next to

118
00:06:28.790 --> 00:06:31.730
them, you'd see just how massive these stone blocks are.

119
00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:35.660
How in the world did he lift these stone blocks on top of these other ones,

120
00:06:35.990 --> 00:06:38.840
not to mention how did they cut and carve these stone blocks?

121
00:06:38.900 --> 00:06:43.280
Do you really think that something so big was done with a bronze saw or a string

122
00:06:43.760 --> 00:06:45.410
sauce? I mean, honestly it doesn't.

123
00:06:45.440 --> 00:06:49.190
How long would it take to do just one stone block, nevermind lifting it,

124
00:06:49.460 --> 00:06:52.730
but then may keep going. Just the incredible knowledge,

125
00:06:52.760 --> 00:06:56.690
the mathematical formulas and equations that are necessary to build a pyramid is

126
00:06:56.691 --> 00:06:57.890
unbelievable. I mean,

127
00:06:57.891 --> 00:07:01.280
pyramids of themselves are kind of like a puzzle and that they have tunnel

128
00:07:01.281 --> 00:07:06.170
systems, air, shafts, and chambers within them. So it's one big, massive puzzle.

129
00:07:06.380 --> 00:07:09.110
Now let me get back to my original point from the opening of this video,

130
00:07:09.111 --> 00:07:12.440
which is that whoever built these pyramids and design them somehow knew

131
00:07:12.441 --> 00:07:16.910
precisely the exact measurements of planet earth and the great pyramid of Giza

132
00:07:16.970 --> 00:07:21.950
is an exact replica based on ratio to the Northern hemisphere down

133
00:07:21.951 --> 00:07:24.620
to a ratio of 43,200.

134
00:07:24.890 --> 00:07:28.430
Now keep that number 4, 3, 2 in mind, as we get going.

135
00:07:28.610 --> 00:07:31.670
Now I'm signing the works of Randall Carlson from his video series that you can

136
00:07:31.671 --> 00:07:35.570
find on YouTube, which is cosmic patterns and cycles of catastrophe.

137
00:07:35.600 --> 00:07:38.360
You have to check this out. I'm only going to touch on it briefly,

138
00:07:38.480 --> 00:07:42.890
and I'm about to leave out so many more important aspects and information that

139
00:07:42.891 --> 00:07:45.200
will completely sell you on what I'm trying to explain here.

140
00:07:45.560 --> 00:07:49.460
But he takes measurements done through several sources of the pyramid alone and

141
00:07:49.461 --> 00:07:52.970
even takes into account that the fact that the great pyramid of Giza had

142
00:07:52.971 --> 00:07:57.320
144,000 casing stones on it before it was destroyed,

143
00:07:57.321 --> 00:07:58.580
somehow were taken apart.

144
00:07:59.090 --> 00:08:02.810
But then he takes measurements of the planet earth dating back from the 1830s

145
00:08:03.050 --> 00:08:07.520
till today. And somehow these measurements of planet earth take for example,

146
00:08:07.521 --> 00:08:12.410
1972 with satellite napping and measurements conducted all equate to a ratio of

147
00:08:12.411 --> 00:08:16.340
43,200 to one. Let me give you a little bit more information,

148
00:08:16.341 --> 00:08:19.580
so you can see how this all fits together. So you have the sun,

149
00:08:19.581 --> 00:08:23.450
which has a diameter of 864,000 or a radius of

150
00:08:23.451 --> 00:08:26.450
432,000. And then you have the moon,

151
00:08:26.451 --> 00:08:29.030
which has a diameter of 2,160,

152
00:08:29.300 --> 00:08:32.090
or the radius being 1080.

153
00:08:32.720 --> 00:08:35.870
But if you were to divide the average distance of the sun from the earth about

154
00:08:35.871 --> 00:08:40.070
93 million miles by the diameter of the sun, 864,000,

155
00:08:40.190 --> 00:08:43.970
it would equal 1 0 8 just as if you were to take the average distance of the

156
00:08:43.971 --> 00:08:47.930
moon to the earth, which is approximately 233,000,

157
00:08:48.200 --> 00:08:52.160
divide that by its diameter, you also equal 108.

158
00:08:52.460 --> 00:08:56.130
Now take that number 1 0 8, which has seen throughout human civilization.

159
00:08:56.131 --> 00:09:00.360
I mean, just one example would be the 108 towers found in Cambodia.

160
00:09:00.600 --> 00:09:04.080
And you'll also find the number 108 found throughout the Hindu religion and

161
00:09:04.081 --> 00:09:05.250
other sources as well.

162
00:09:05.490 --> 00:09:09.840
Now I mentioned that the pyramid of Giza had 144,000 casing stones. Well,

163
00:09:09.841 --> 00:09:14.640
144,000 minutes exist in one day 86,400

164
00:09:14.641 --> 00:09:15.960
seconds exists in a day.

165
00:09:16.140 --> 00:09:20.100
And in a half day you have 43,200 seconds in a day.

166
00:09:20.370 --> 00:09:23.940
Now take those numbers 1 44 or the 8, 6, 4,

167
00:09:24.000 --> 00:09:27.660
which is just one decimal short of being the diameter of the sun.

168
00:09:28.170 --> 00:09:32.670
But let's look at the 43,200 seconds and a half day throughout ancient human

169
00:09:32.671 --> 00:09:36.270
civilization. There's a huge focus on as above so below. Well,

170
00:09:36.271 --> 00:09:37.740
if you take the octahedron,

171
00:09:37.741 --> 00:09:40.590
which is essentially two pyramids stacked on top of each other,

172
00:09:40.591 --> 00:09:42.660
with the pointy ends going opposite direction,

173
00:09:42.750 --> 00:09:46.320
the angles combined equal 1,440.

174
00:09:47.040 --> 00:09:51.780
Think about that. There's 1,440 minutes in a day. So if you take the octahedron,

175
00:09:51.810 --> 00:09:54.450
you have 1,440 degrees of angle. Now, the,

176
00:09:54.451 --> 00:09:57.720
one of the things that I mentioned earlier is the fact that the great pyramid of

177
00:09:57.721 --> 00:10:00.810
Giza in this ratio of 43,200,

178
00:10:00.811 --> 00:10:03.300
that I'm referring to even takes into account.

179
00:10:03.300 --> 00:10:07.830
The fact that the earth is wider around the equator than it is around the poles.

180
00:10:08.010 --> 00:10:09.540
And when you have the great pyramid of Giza,

181
00:10:09.570 --> 00:10:14.310
essentially equating to a ratio of 43,200, well again,

182
00:10:14.640 --> 00:10:18.780
43,200 is how many seconds there are in a half day.

183
00:10:18.990 --> 00:10:20.280
So half the earth.

184
00:10:20.370 --> 00:10:24.120
And it just so happens that the exact measurements create a perfect ratio of

185
00:10:24.121 --> 00:10:29.040
43,200. Is this really just a coincidence? I mean, the number 4,

186
00:10:29.040 --> 00:10:32.310
3 2 was found through numerous other sources of ancient human civilization,

187
00:10:32.550 --> 00:10:36.270
whether it be in Hindu texts, whether it's be the Arvida or the,

188
00:10:36.300 --> 00:10:40.200
even the [inaudible] and Sumerian king God's equal a total years of

189
00:10:40.201 --> 00:10:44.220
432,000, or even the Kali yoga 430,

190
00:10:44.221 --> 00:10:48.510
2000 or the Mahu Hugo's, which he goes 4 billion, 320,000.

191
00:10:48.511 --> 00:10:50.640
There's that number 4, 3, 2, which by the way,

192
00:10:50.641 --> 00:10:54.030
is incredibly close to the estimated age of the earth being approximately four

193
00:10:54.031 --> 00:10:58.260
and a half billion years. And look at the number 43 to used in modern times.

194
00:10:58.261 --> 00:11:00.750
I mean, if you look in the back of the $1 bill, which for some reason,

195
00:11:00.751 --> 00:11:05.550
of course has this pyramid, what has 13 levels of pyramid block stacks on it?

196
00:11:05.760 --> 00:11:07.800
Well, if you times that by 33.3,

197
00:11:07.801 --> 00:11:12.180
which is a favorite number of masons that just so happens to equal 4, 3, 2,

198
00:11:12.630 --> 00:11:15.840
we also find the number 4, 3, 2 in harmonic frequencies,

199
00:11:15.841 --> 00:11:18.660
dating back all the way to the Sumerians. Anyways, guys,

200
00:11:18.661 --> 00:11:20.400
I got to close this up cause it's getting long,

201
00:11:20.401 --> 00:11:22.710
but take into account everything that I've covered here,

202
00:11:22.830 --> 00:11:26.430
whether it be the location of the pyramid or the fact this number 4, 3,

203
00:11:26.430 --> 00:11:30.390
2 just ties into everything from our clock to various sources throughout ancient

204
00:11:30.391 --> 00:11:34.440
human civilization. You have to start asking some real serious questions here.

205
00:11:34.920 --> 00:11:35.101
I,

206
00:11:35.101 --> 00:11:38.730
for one absolute do not believe that this is within the realm of a coincidence.

207
00:11:38.880 --> 00:11:39.390
In fact,

208
00:11:39.390 --> 00:11:43.050
it's evidence that there was a advanced ancient human civilization that dates

209
00:11:43.051 --> 00:11:44.640
back before the last cataclysm,

210
00:11:44.641 --> 00:11:48.690
which of course I have several videos on already. Anyways, guys, I'm Jimmy.

211
00:11:48.691 --> 00:11:51.090
This is bright insight like and subscribe and leave me a comment.

212
00:11:51.091 --> 00:11:52.260
Let me know what your thoughts are.

213
00:11:52.350 --> 00:11:55.680
And I have many videos to come and a whole wide variety of topics. Take care,

214
00:11:55.681 --> 00:11:56.130
everybody.
