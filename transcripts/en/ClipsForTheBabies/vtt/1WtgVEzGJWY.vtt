00:00:00.210 --> 00:00:03.120
<v 0>So, um, the re so, uh,</v>

2
00:00:03.150 --> 00:00:07.140
the reason why I know what date it is is because

3
00:00:07.680 --> 00:00:10.500
DirecTV is supposed to come to my house on the 31st.

4
00:00:10.501 --> 00:00:14.060
Now I put out a little bit of a hot freestyle on,

5
00:00:14.061 --> 00:00:17.040
on my Instagram and my Twitter and my, to, uh,

6
00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:21.060
about how I was feeling about DirecTV and my troubles with DirecTV. Now

7
00:00:22.770 --> 00:00:26.370
is DirecTV the worst customer service on the planet? Yes, it is.

8
00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:28.050
It's the worst customer service in the planet.

9
00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:33.230
You would get better customer from a, crack. You know,

10
00:00:33.590 --> 00:00:34.790
you'd be like, where is she?

11
00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:37.820
She was supposed to be here and give me some crack and a blow job,

12
00:00:37.850 --> 00:00:40.220
but she's not reliable. And you'd be like, well,

13
00:00:40.221 --> 00:00:43.800
at least we're not dealing with DirecTV. Uh,

14
00:00:43.801 --> 00:00:46.820
apparently ever since DirecTV merged with at and T at T and T said, it.

15
00:00:46.821 --> 00:00:49.670
And just want to get a bunch of new customers and not keep the pre-existing

16
00:00:49.671 --> 00:00:52.670
customers happy. I don't know what the deal is.

17
00:00:52.910 --> 00:00:56.150
What I do know is I've called DirecTV. Like, they're my,

18
00:00:56.660 --> 00:00:59.780
ex-girlfriend like, they're my ex-girlfriend.

19
00:00:59.781 --> 00:01:03.350
And we're just trying to salvage what we have left, but we can't,

20
00:01:04.370 --> 00:01:07.370
I'm calling them too much and they're not calling back,

21
00:01:07.400 --> 00:01:11.420
which is another thing why they're like my ex-girlfriend. Okay. That sucks.

22
00:01:14.570 --> 00:01:19.250
Um, and it's absolutely ridiculous because they're supposed to come,

23
00:01:19.310 --> 00:01:22.640
let me just break down the story for you guys. Okay. Babies, look,

24
00:01:22.910 --> 00:01:26.150
here's what is going on?

25
00:01:28.070 --> 00:01:29.420
Am I clear my throat too much? Yeah.

26
00:01:31.970 --> 00:01:36.230
Is it because it's that time of year? Yeah. Is it coming from my throat and my,

27
00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:41.690
the postnasal. Yeah. Did I put creamer in my coffee?

28
00:01:41.691 --> 00:01:45.380
Which I never do. And it activated a little bit more this morning. Yes.

29
00:01:46.430 --> 00:01:50.750
Are we going to get through it? Yeah. But, um, yeah. Yeah.

30
00:01:50.751 --> 00:01:54.680
So I want two extra boxes of DirecTV. Now.

31
00:01:54.710 --> 00:01:59.240
Here's what we're not going to do. Okay, nobody's going to say, Whoa,

32
00:01:59.750 --> 00:02:02.510
first world problems. We're not going to do that. Do you know why?

33
00:02:02.810 --> 00:02:07.400
Because you're listening to this podcast. Therefore he in the first world,

34
00:02:07.790 --> 00:02:11.630
okay. Nobody's listening to the podcast in a hut.

35
00:02:12.530 --> 00:02:17.150
So don't be such a, you know, when people say that kind of,

36
00:02:17.360 --> 00:02:19.220
it drives me nuts. Well, first world problems.

37
00:02:19.340 --> 00:02:21.020
Cause you're only saying that on the internet,

38
00:02:21.021 --> 00:02:23.450
which means you in the first world,

39
00:02:24.260 --> 00:02:28.730
you're commenting it under a YouTube vid in the first world.

40
00:02:29.510 --> 00:02:33.890
Okay. So I, uh, all my problems are first real problem.

41
00:02:33.891 --> 00:02:37.580
You know why I'm in the first world, baby. So anyway, I called,

42
00:02:39.920 --> 00:02:43.730
um, direct TV now, already. Uh,

43
00:02:43.731 --> 00:02:47.930
don't wanna so DirecTV, you better make it easy now,

44
00:02:47.931 --> 00:02:50.750
do they make it easy? No. Why don't they make it easy?

45
00:02:50.780 --> 00:02:53.120
Because they already have me as a customer. They don't think I'll cancel.

46
00:02:53.150 --> 00:02:56.960
What they don't know is your boy will cancel and your boy will go to dish.

47
00:02:57.440 --> 00:03:02.320
Your blood will take the dish off top of the house and he will bring it down in

48
00:03:02.321 --> 00:03:05.980
the front yard, leave it there and have a guy drive by and pick it up.

49
00:03:06.130 --> 00:03:08.860
I don't give a. Is it going to cost me money? Doesn't matter.

50
00:03:09.060 --> 00:03:13.950
We're out here to prove a point. Plus my, my brings trucks.

51
00:03:16.200 --> 00:03:18.990
So man, we all know which direction they go.

52
00:03:22.410 --> 00:03:26.490
So I call the DirecTV guy. Now let's do a guess.

53
00:03:27.090 --> 00:03:31.440
Does he speak English? Well, ah, you already know.

54
00:03:32.220 --> 00:03:36.870
All right, so hello. How are you doing? We'll talk to 'em. Hello?

55
00:03:36.871 --> 00:03:40.950
This is a directive. [inaudible] okay. Yeah. Cool. Well, first of all,

56
00:03:40.951 --> 00:03:44.940
I want you to see you really value you as a customer. Stop right there.

57
00:03:45.240 --> 00:03:47.880
You don't need to tell me how much you value me as a customer

58
00:03:49.470 --> 00:03:52.020
because you actually aren't DirecTV.

59
00:03:53.130 --> 00:03:56.340
You're just a guy they hired you. Don't give a. You have your own family.

60
00:03:56.430 --> 00:04:00.180
You go home and you forget about my phone call and that's fine, dude.

61
00:04:00.390 --> 00:04:03.840
That is absolutely fine. So don't say the transcript.

62
00:04:04.470 --> 00:04:08.610
Don't say the that they tell you to say, I'm a person, you purse, let's do this.

63
00:04:08.730 --> 00:04:13.140
Okay. And he says, Oh, um,

64
00:04:13.170 --> 00:04:16.020
so what's the problem what's going on? I said, I just want two boxes.

65
00:04:16.080 --> 00:04:20.070
And he says, okay, now, Oh, let me give you a backstory. The guy,

66
00:04:20.460 --> 00:04:23.700
when they first showed up and gave me the first boxes, they came up,

67
00:04:23.970 --> 00:04:27.510
the first guy that came big Samoan type looking dude comes in, Hey, what's up?

68
00:04:27.540 --> 00:04:30.450
I said, Oh, Hey. Yeah, we need to put boxes over here. And he says, Oh,

69
00:04:30.451 --> 00:04:33.120
I can't do that. If the guy's not here, if your video audio guys in here,

70
00:04:33.420 --> 00:04:37.800
I said really? And he said, yeah. I said, okay. So can you come? When,

71
00:04:37.801 --> 00:04:40.500
can you come next time? He said, uh, Friday, I said, that's perfect.

72
00:04:40.501 --> 00:04:44.220
That's all my video audio guy's coming. Oh. And he said, okay. I said,

73
00:04:44.221 --> 00:04:46.110
can you make the appointment? And he said, sure. I said,

74
00:04:46.111 --> 00:04:47.880
can you make it right now in front of me? And he said, sure.

75
00:04:48.240 --> 00:04:51.750
He pulled up his little thing that looked like a Palm pilot. Hey DirecTV.

76
00:04:51.840 --> 00:04:54.450
You're using Palm pilots. And he plugged it in. He said, cool.

77
00:04:54.570 --> 00:04:59.010
I'll appointments. All set for Friday. I said, Oh great. He said it to my face.

78
00:04:59.011 --> 00:05:03.960
I looked at his eyes and this Samoan guy said it to me face. So he left Friday.

79
00:05:04.260 --> 00:05:07.560
Ah, what the you guessed it?

80
00:05:08.370 --> 00:05:13.200
The video audio guy was the only guy that showed up the DirecTV guy

81
00:05:13.201 --> 00:05:17.850
didn't show up. So when the video audio guy showed up,

82
00:05:17.880 --> 00:05:21.870
I asked him and I said, Hey man, they said that they couldn't do it without you.

83
00:05:21.871 --> 00:05:25.770
And he said, Oh, that's. They do it all the time. And I said, huh?

84
00:05:26.070 --> 00:05:29.850
So not only did he lie and was he a lazy? He's not here.

85
00:05:29.851 --> 00:05:33.240
When he said he would be. So they came the next day and did it.

86
00:05:33.600 --> 00:05:36.270
I knew a new guy, a different guy came,

87
00:05:36.271 --> 00:05:39.540
did it without the video and audio guy and still did it. So that first,

88
00:05:42.120 --> 00:05:44.760
all right. So now everybody's a liar at DirecTV.

89
00:05:44.761 --> 00:05:47.040
So far I've dealt with except for the new guy.

90
00:05:47.550 --> 00:05:51.180
So now I'm already when I'm calling. So I called them up and I say, Hey,

91
00:05:51.330 --> 00:05:54.240
I need two boxes. And he says, okay. I say, send me the confirmation.

92
00:05:54.241 --> 00:05:57.860
And he says, okay, we can send a confirmation. I said, can you, he said,

93
00:05:57.861 --> 00:06:00.200
what's the email. Could I send it to? I said, why don't you just text it to me?

94
00:06:00.201 --> 00:06:02.450
So I get it right now. And he says, okay, Ken do it right now,

95
00:06:02.480 --> 00:06:04.760
but we'll get it to you in the an hour. I said, so to be clear,

96
00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:07.700
you're texting me. I said, what's my phone number. He told me my phone number.

97
00:06:07.970 --> 00:06:11.960
I said, so be clear, you're texting me this confirmation in one hour.

98
00:06:11.990 --> 00:06:14.480
And he said, yes. I said, great. So we'll have it in one hour. And if I don't,

99
00:06:14.481 --> 00:06:19.370
I'll call back. And he says, okay, now the video now, the, the, the call was,

100
00:06:19.371 --> 00:06:22.310
was already, uh, by the way that they record all these call for,

101
00:06:22.790 --> 00:06:25.580
for whatever purpose they record these for.

102
00:06:26.150 --> 00:06:29.840
You need to listen to these back again. Okay. Anyway, I wait,

103
00:06:29.870 --> 00:06:31.580
I sit and I wait.

104
00:06:31.581 --> 00:06:35.420
I literally sit and I wait for one hour.

105
00:06:37.010 --> 00:06:41.960
The second, the hour goes by, I check my texts.

106
00:06:42.470 --> 00:06:47.090
Absolutely nothing. Just texts from fuck-ups friends,

107
00:06:47.420 --> 00:06:48.253
family members.

108
00:06:50.150 --> 00:06:53.570
So I call them immediately and I get guess what a new person,

109
00:06:53.630 --> 00:06:58.400
which is highly annoying, but I get it.

110
00:06:58.640 --> 00:07:03.410
Okay. So now it's a female. All good. A little bit better to deal with.

111
00:07:03.560 --> 00:07:07.550
Can I understand the word she's saying? No. So she's saying,

112
00:07:07.580 --> 00:07:10.490
I explained to her what I just explained to you what happened? And she says,

113
00:07:10.700 --> 00:07:14.120
okay, well, we'll send you a, we'll make sure that the thing I, Oh, wait,

114
00:07:14.121 --> 00:07:17.510
the first guy I told him. I said, Hey, I need a guy to come out Thursday.

115
00:07:17.511 --> 00:07:20.600
And he says, okay, well, let me check up. Okay, well, earliest I could come.

116
00:07:20.690 --> 00:07:22.520
And Saturday I said, Oh no, we can't do that.

117
00:07:22.521 --> 00:07:26.060
He's got to come Thursdays as well. Unfortunately. Um, we kind of have it. Um,

118
00:07:26.270 --> 00:07:29.960
we can't have it, uh, Saturday. Uh, we can't have it Thursday.

119
00:07:29.961 --> 00:07:32.600
We have to have a Saturday. I said, ah, we'll see, uh,

120
00:07:32.601 --> 00:07:34.520
what you gotta do is you gotta move some stuff around.

121
00:07:34.521 --> 00:07:37.430
I don't really care what you do, but guys gotta come Thursday. How's that sound?

122
00:07:37.640 --> 00:07:41.030
And the guy says, well, let me check. Um, okay,

123
00:07:41.031 --> 00:07:45.500
so we can have them come Thursday. So now, now I'm. Cause he could have done it.

124
00:07:45.710 --> 00:07:50.120
What changed in the last second? Just me saying no, do it. All right.

125
00:07:50.480 --> 00:07:53.150
So now he said all that. I didn't get the confirmation. So all can,

126
00:07:53.151 --> 00:07:56.810
now I'm calling a flash flashback, flashback back forward to the lady.

127
00:07:57.950 --> 00:07:59.780
So now I'm talking, I said, yeah, can you do the thing?

128
00:08:00.860 --> 00:08:04.190
I didn't get the a confirmation text. And she says, Oh, okay. Um,

129
00:08:04.191 --> 00:08:06.080
I don't know why he didn't get it, but uh, we can,

130
00:08:06.140 --> 00:08:10.130
we can guarantee you get a confirmation text within

131
00:08:10.670 --> 00:08:15.620
24 hours. And I said, well, now the first guy said I could get it in an hour,

132
00:08:15.621 --> 00:08:18.530
but you're telling me I can't get it in an hour. I have to get it in 24 hours.

133
00:08:19.490 --> 00:08:22.370
And she says, yes. I said, well, why did that first guy tell me one hour?

134
00:08:22.371 --> 00:08:25.400
And she says, I don't know, because you're not the guy. That's why,

135
00:08:25.430 --> 00:08:27.650
because you're not the guy. You're a different person than this. How you do it.

136
00:08:27.651 --> 00:08:31.640
You keep pulling people off until you, the guy gives up, but I'm not giving up,

137
00:08:31.641 --> 00:08:35.660
man. Oh, I don't give up, dude. I'm not giving up.

138
00:08:38.180 --> 00:08:42.470
So I say, okay. So you're telling me to be clear in 24 hours,

139
00:08:42.471 --> 00:08:45.140
I'm going to have an email and it's going to tell me that you're coming

140
00:08:45.141 --> 00:08:47.450
Thursday. And she says, yes, absolutely. I said, what's your name?

141
00:08:47.630 --> 00:08:51.320
She says her name. I don't remember it now meant to remember. It says, okay,

142
00:08:52.460 --> 00:08:56.670
I wait now I do. I go about my day. I sit, I eat, I sleep.

143
00:08:56.700 --> 00:09:01.590
I wake up in the morning and I'm waiting. I'm waiting 1:00 PM. I'm waiting.

144
00:09:01.950 --> 00:09:03.660
Cause that's 24 hour Mark. Guess what?

145
00:09:04.050 --> 00:09:08.190
The 24 hour Mark goes by no text,

146
00:09:09.210 --> 00:09:12.300
no text. I check my email.

147
00:09:14.310 --> 00:09:17.700
I get an email. I guess with the email says,

148
00:09:19.110 --> 00:09:19.980
the email says

149
00:09:21.630 --> 00:09:25.140
a guy will be at your place

150
00:09:26.490 --> 00:09:28.410
from noon to four,

151
00:09:29.190 --> 00:09:32.280
anytime in between there and get this.

152
00:09:33.240 --> 00:09:35.070
It says he's coming today.

153
00:09:37.110 --> 00:09:38.400
The day I get the email.

154
00:09:40.140 --> 00:09:44.940

00:14:32.881 --> 00:14:34.740
stage and opening my next special with it. That's what I'm doing.

224
00:14:34.741 --> 00:14:36.990
If you don't show up Thursday and I'm switching to dish,

225
00:14:40.870 --> 00:14:42.480
A matter of fact, if you don't come,

226
00:14:42.510 --> 00:14:45.660
I'm taking all the dish employees out to dinner, dude. That's what I'm doing.

And I'm wining and dining them and I'm going to make love to them dude.

228
00:14:49.140 --> 00:14:50.250

I don't give a if they're guys or girls, it's not a gay or straight thing.

232
00:14:59.360 --> 00:15:03.260
It's a retaliation thing to you, on DirecTV,

233
00:15:03.770 --> 00:15:05.810
because I don't around with this, dude.

234
00:15:06.050 --> 00:15:09.890
If I make an appointment with somebody and we say 10 30 on virtual,

235
00:15:09.891 --> 00:15:11.180
I don't make an appointment that says, Oh yeah,

236
00:15:11.181 --> 00:15:14.120
it's going to be between noon and four I'll show up sometime. No,

237
00:15:14.270 --> 00:15:18.940
if that happened, I wouldn't be successful. You Dunces,

238
