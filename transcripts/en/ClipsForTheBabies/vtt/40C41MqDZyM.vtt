00:00:00.150 --> 00:00:03.150
<v 0>They're trying to get rid of, uh, uh, how about the lady that was on?</v>

2
00:00:03.180 --> 00:00:06.240
What was it? Good morning America or no, it was a British show. Right?

3
00:00:07.620 --> 00:00:10.380
How do I pull that up? Where she was trying to get rid of clapping?

4
00:00:11.880 --> 00:00:16.650
Get batting clapping. Good morning, Britain. Basic.

5
00:00:18.090 --> 00:00:20.790
Good morning, Britain. Subasic

6
00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:27.570
Gore morning. Good morning. Why can't I say it, dude.

7
00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:34.050
Brattain here we go. Should we ban clapping? Good morning. Britain

8
00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:37.763
victorious. The song.

9
00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:42.680
<v 1>Let's take the serious side of this first. What is upsetting?</v>

10
00:00:42.770 --> 00:00:44.600
Genuinely about clapping. Okay.

11
00:00:45.080 --> 00:00:49.190
<v 0>Nothing. There you go. And there is something about clapping nothing.</v>

12
00:00:49.191 --> 00:00:51.770
And thank you. I'll wait for my that's.

13
00:00:51.860 --> 00:00:54.440
How that should add [inaudible] right there. And then right here, there's our.

14
00:00:55.400 --> 00:00:57.170
<v 1>The serious side of this first.</v>

15
00:00:57.590 --> 00:01:01.040
What is upsetting genuinely about clapping? Nothing.

16
00:01:01.820 --> 00:01:05.960
<v 0>No thing. Oh, absolutely. Nothing. That's hard to get away.</v>

17
00:01:08.300 --> 00:01:10.850
Let's take this serious. I want to do it again because I'm annoying.

18
00:01:11.150 --> 00:01:14.090
<v 1>What is upsetting genuinely about clapping?</v>

19
00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:15.973
<v 0>Absolutely.</v>

20
00:01:20.030 --> 00:01:23.300
[inaudible] Oh. That's funny, dude. Anyway, so this is what, this is what it is,

21
00:01:23.301 --> 00:01:24.134
what it does.

22
00:01:24.290 --> 00:01:25.520
<v 1>What is upsetting?</v>

23
00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:29.990
So it's actually not just in people with anxiety. It's also.

24
00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:35.510
<v 0>So it's actually like, it's actually not just people with anxiety.</v>

25
00:01:35.900 --> 00:01:38.660
<v 1>People who use hearing AIDS, copping can be disruptive to that,</v>

26
00:01:39.700 --> 00:01:43.010
but it's also people who use hearing AIDS. Clapping could be disruptive to that.

27
00:01:43.340 --> 00:01:45.170
People have sensory processing issues.

28
00:01:45.171 --> 00:01:48.620
It can be very distressing and overwhelming to have those loud sudden noises.

29
00:01:48.830 --> 00:01:51.530
But it is part of our culture.

30
00:01:52.160 --> 00:01:56.150
<v 0>Go. Let's just so far. I agree with both of them.</v>

31
00:01:57.050 --> 00:01:58.760
Let's see how it derails.

32
00:01:59.570 --> 00:02:01.850
<v 1>The isn't it to clap. If you go to the thing.</v>

33
00:02:02.060 --> 00:02:06.980
<v 0>Look at this, look at how look I love when people try to be diplomatic about,</v>

34
00:02:07.430 --> 00:02:08.210
about something,

35
00:02:08.210 --> 00:02:12.050
but it's impossible to make them not sound like and not feel like an idiot.

36
00:02:12.590 --> 00:02:16.130
Why it's a bit like part of like the culture, right?

37
00:02:16.280 --> 00:02:20.090
When we go to the theater, you're going to expect to hear clapping right now.

38
00:02:20.110 --> 00:02:23.930
I don't mean that you're a piece of when I say that,

39
00:02:24.110 --> 00:02:25.190
but it's literally,

40
00:02:25.400 --> 00:02:30.350
it's virtually impossible for me to not make you seem like a piece of, right?

41
00:02:30.680 --> 00:02:35.480
Because I'm saying something that's so obvious. You're not mine. Anyway,

42
00:02:35.481 --> 00:02:36.560
go ahead. Expand on that.

43
00:02:37.140 --> 00:02:38.750
<v 1>Culture. Isn't it to clap.</v>

44
00:02:38.780 --> 00:02:43.610
If you go to the theater or you go to a lecture or you go to a performance or

45
00:02:43.611 --> 00:02:48.110
you go to a gig, you would expect that people would clap. Yeah,

46
00:02:48.140 --> 00:02:51.680
absolutely. And that could be preventing people from going to those events.

47
00:02:52.730 --> 00:02:57.200
<v 0>I agree with both of them and we're, you know,</v>

48
00:02:58.190 --> 00:03:02.320
37 in and, and your boy agrees with both of them, dude.

49
00:03:02.620 --> 00:03:04.240
So this is great, man.

50
00:03:05.940 --> 00:03:07.260
<v 1>Which is a real shame. So if some.</v>

51
00:03:10.890 --> 00:03:11.723
<v 2>Oh wait, hold on.</v>

52
00:03:12.610 --> 00:03:15.900
<v 1>And that could be preventing people from going to those events. Oh, okay.</v>

53
00:03:17.820 --> 00:03:18.653
Which is a real shame.

54
00:03:22.680 --> 00:03:23.580
<v 2>I picked the side.</v>

55
00:03:27.300 --> 00:03:28.140
I picked the side.

56
00:03:28.710 --> 00:03:30.600
<v 1>Too. If some theaters or some university.</v>

57
00:03:30.640 --> 00:03:34.590
<v 0>I took a step on over to the other side. I took a step. Okay.</v>

58
00:03:35.310 --> 00:03:36.630
Maybe I got another foot. I'm like, well,

59
00:03:36.631 --> 00:03:37.680
let's see what this other lady has to say.

60
00:03:37.800 --> 00:03:39.960
Let's do more with this lady has to date. Maybe I'll call back.

61
00:03:40.080 --> 00:03:41.940
Do you know what I'm saying? We'll see.

62
00:03:42.550 --> 00:03:43.680
<v 1>We can be more inclusive.</v>

63
00:03:46.500 --> 00:03:47.333
<v 2>[Inaudible].</v>

64
00:03:48.720 --> 00:03:50.380
<v 0>I li I'm leaning over into that foot.</v>

65
00:03:50.480 --> 00:03:53.910
I stepped by tuck jazz hands instead.

66
00:03:56.820 --> 00:03:57.060
<v 2>And.</v>

67
00:03:57.060 --> 00:04:01.470
<v 0>Just like that, I'm on an escalator in a full sprint.</v>

68
00:04:02.490 --> 00:04:05.370
When you say jazz hands you'll lose the argument.

69
00:04:05.820 --> 00:04:08.670
It doesn't matter if the argument is for jazz hats,

70
00:04:10.080 --> 00:04:10.950
it doesn't matter.

71
00:04:11.460 --> 00:04:14.730
It doesn't matter if the debate is called the jazz hands debate.

72
00:04:15.200 --> 00:04:19.590
Soon as you say, jazz hands yellows. Okay.

73
00:04:19.591 --> 00:04:21.600
Let's just go back and let me not interrupt you.

74
00:04:22.380 --> 00:04:24.840
<v 1>That people would clap. Yeah, absolutely.</v>

75
00:04:24.841 --> 00:04:27.810
And that could be preventing people from going to those events,

76
00:04:27.990 --> 00:04:31.410
which is a real shame. So if some theaters or some universities say,

77
00:04:31.470 --> 00:04:34.590
actually we can be more inclusive and do jazz hands and said,

78
00:04:35.010 --> 00:04:38.100
that'd be lovely and more people could get involved. And then what did you hear?

79
00:04:38.101 --> 00:04:38.934
The guy?

80
00:04:39.390 --> 00:04:41.250
<v 2>Ooh, Ooh. Just.</v>

81
00:04:44.190 --> 00:04:46.500
<v 0>Oh my God. That was amazing. I never heard that yet.</v>

82
00:04:47.310 --> 00:04:51.330
<v 2>Oh, Ooh. Ooh. Someone is this stupid? Okay. Um, yeah.</v>

83
00:04:55.770 --> 00:04:59.340
Oh, Oh gosh. Oh gosh. Okay.

84
00:05:01.500 --> 00:05:04.710
<v 1>And do jazz hands and said that'd be lovely. And more people could get involved.</v>

85
00:05:06.600 --> 00:05:09.360
<v 2>Oh my Oh, by, Oh.</v>

86
00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:15.600
<v 0>Just hurt himself. Literally. When she said that she said it.</v>

87
00:05:16.080 --> 00:05:19.800
<v 2>Oh, Oh, Oh, Oh, okay.</v>

88
00:05:19.801 --> 00:05:23.190
It's going to be okay. I just have to breathe.

89
00:05:24.030 --> 00:05:26.850
I hope I die before this actually implements.

90
00:05:27.540 --> 00:05:31.080
<v 1>Nazi. If you clapped, I don't think there's going to be. You could get involved.</v>

91
00:05:31.140 --> 00:05:33.600
And then what would be the penalty if you clap.

92
00:05:33.630 --> 00:05:37.110
<v 0>What if she said tasers, tasers,</v>

93
00:05:37.111 --> 00:05:38.700
and we throw bologna at your face.

94
00:05:39.180 --> 00:05:41.430
<v 1>I don't think there's going to be a penalty, frankly.</v>

95
00:05:41.431 --> 00:05:43.020
I don't think anyone's going to say like.

96
00:05:43.380 --> 00:05:46.230
<v 0>I like how that lady came back in and like was kind of like, Oh listen,</v>

97
00:05:46.231 --> 00:05:48.810
it's not going to be okay. It's not going to be, you know,

98
00:05:48.840 --> 00:05:52.740
I like how I like how she's arguing. She's arguing for the wrong thing.

99
00:05:52.830 --> 00:05:57.620
And we all know it. We need to leave.

100
00:05:57.950 --> 00:05:58.160
But.

101
00:05:58.160 --> 00:05:58.880
<v 1>If you.</v>

102
00:05:58.880 --> 00:06:02.600
<v 0>Are, the guy came in again with you, of course, they're not going to leave.</v>

103
00:06:02.601 --> 00:06:06.830
They're not going to be asked to leave. We've been dealing with as a sign.

104
00:06:06.831 --> 00:06:07.664
He was out at home.

105
00:06:08.860 --> 00:06:10.300
<v 1>Where persisting with clapping,</v>

106
00:06:10.690 --> 00:06:14.680
even though you've been requested to do something, that's been very polite.

107
00:06:14.681 --> 00:06:16.660
Is it like, I think people understand.

108
00:06:16.661 --> 00:06:19.580
If you're requested to do something in a specific context, you can do it.

109
00:06:19.660 --> 00:06:20.730
<v 3>Would it stop you Andrew?</v>

110
00:06:20.731 --> 00:06:23.200
If you were somewhere and you felt the urge to clap someone,

111
00:06:23.201 --> 00:06:24.730
and yet they'd said we don't clap here.

112
00:06:25.090 --> 00:06:29.560
<v 0>Oh, that guy, dude, every</v>

113
00:06:31.780 --> 00:06:35.860
syllable he said was the same note. That guy was on real.

114
00:06:36.370 --> 00:06:39.760
I'm not even talking about the thing anymore. The clapping and not clapping.

115
00:06:39.940 --> 00:06:44.720
That guy was so angry that he was trying to control his voice with any,

116
00:06:44.770 --> 00:06:49.570
he did it too hard. The other way it was, everything was one note. [inaudible].

117
00:06:50.440 --> 00:06:54.670
<v 1>Even though you've been requested, that's very polite. Isn't it?</v>

118
00:06:55.270 --> 00:06:58.720
People understand. If you're requested to do something in a specific context,

119
00:06:58.780 --> 00:06:59.613
you can do it.

120
00:06:59.710 --> 00:07:01.600
<v 0>He's like, I'm so mad. Okay. Let's just calm down.</v>

121
00:07:01.601 --> 00:07:04.870
Let's not try to get a rise up my voice. Let's be, let's do this. Come on,

122
00:07:04.871 --> 00:07:05.530
nodule.

123
00:07:05.530 --> 00:07:08.830
<v 3>Stop you Andrew. If you were somewhere and you felt the urge to clap someone,</v>

124
00:07:08.831 --> 00:07:10.360
and yet they'd said we don't clap here.

125
00:07:11.710 --> 00:07:15.250
<v 0>What if you went somewhere and someone found the to crap and then someone said,</v>

126
00:07:15.430 --> 00:07:18.850
wait, don't cut. Pay out. And then it says like you did it nausea.

127
00:07:19.420 --> 00:07:20.410
<v 3>Well, no it wouldn't.</v>

128
00:07:20.440 --> 00:07:24.250
But what we don't do is completely restructure society and completely change

129
00:07:24.251 --> 00:07:27.850
societal norms in order to accommodate the sensibilities of a few people. Yeah.

130
00:07:28.000 --> 00:07:30.820
<v 1>It's interesting. Just reading a story about this on, uh,</v>

131
00:07:30.821 --> 00:07:32.770
on the BBC news website, um, uh,

132
00:07:32.890 --> 00:07:34.840
an individual called Hannah from Weymouth endorse.

133
00:07:34.841 --> 00:07:39.430
It does she struggles with loud noises like clapping. Cool.

134
00:07:39.910 --> 00:07:43.000
Um, she was diagnosed with autism when she was 23. She says,

135
00:07:43.001 --> 00:07:47.950
I don't agree with a ban on clapping instead let's raise awareness

136
00:07:48.040 --> 00:07:51.310
of autism because this could breed resentment.

137
00:07:51.430 --> 00:07:55.630
If other students start to Harbor bad feelings towards autism.

138
00:07:55.900 --> 00:07:59.410
<v 0>Yeah. That's smart. She's real smart. So listen. Um, okay.</v>

139
00:08:01.660 --> 00:08:03.550
Uh, banning

140
00:08:05.050 --> 00:08:06.940
what w okay.

141
00:08:07.330 --> 00:08:11.520
I got to Minneapolis and I went into a pub or a bar,

142
00:08:11.530 --> 00:08:14.770
whatever the it was. And when I got there,

143
00:08:16.480 --> 00:08:18.340
I had to get something to eat. It was like two 30.

144
00:08:18.341 --> 00:08:21.070
I wanted to eat at two 30 because I didn't want to have to eat right before my

145
00:08:21.071 --> 00:08:24.940
special taping, because I would have been on the mic, just like, so anyway,

146
00:08:26.050 --> 00:08:28.750
you know, that's what happens. You're just like, yeah. So what's the deal with

147
00:08:30.340 --> 00:08:31.173
anyway.

148
00:08:34.510 --> 00:08:38.410
So I ate at the right time and when I was there,

149
00:08:40.060 --> 00:08:41.380
I was in a place.

150
00:08:42.190 --> 00:08:47.020
And there was a really big local, you know,

151
00:08:47.350 --> 00:08:49.240
football game that was playing now.

152
00:08:49.330 --> 00:08:53.560
Did it make me mad that it wasn't a professional team, even.

153
00:08:53.650 --> 00:08:58.590
Yes. You, but it wasn't show where they were. They're old men cheering for,

154
00:08:59.190 --> 00:09:02.820
you know, 19 year olds on a field throwing a ball around. Yes.

155
00:09:02.821 --> 00:09:06.930
Did that make me feel like life was hopeless? Yes. Is it all right? Sure.

156
00:09:07.380 --> 00:09:11.580
Because life rips regardless. So I was there. I ordered a Turkey club.

157
00:09:11.640 --> 00:09:15.790
You know how we do. I like to keep it fresh, even though that's what I,

158
00:09:15.791 --> 00:09:17.850
I get a lot. I hadn't gotten it for a long time.

159
00:09:17.880 --> 00:09:19.260
So I got the Turkey club and I was like,

160
00:09:19.261 --> 00:09:22.500
this is gonna be the great thing before I meal, before my meal,

161
00:09:22.680 --> 00:09:26.610
before my special. Right. So this football game was going on.

162
00:09:26.790 --> 00:09:29.160
People were watching it. I step in, I sit down,

163
00:09:29.220 --> 00:09:32.010
I order it as soon as I start ordering people are

164
00:09:33.930 --> 00:09:38.040
raw and screaming. Now, did that make me mad? Yes.

165
00:09:38.041 --> 00:09:42.390
Did I feel it in my heart? Of course. Did my chest tighten up?

166
00:09:42.540 --> 00:09:47.040
Yes. Was I trying to do everything I could from getting into a bad mood?

167
00:09:47.340 --> 00:09:51.330
Yes. Did I somehow opened the door on the bad mood? Yeah,

168
00:09:51.690 --> 00:09:53.490
I did then did I think, Oh.

169
00:09:54.420 --> 00:09:56.520
I don't want to be in a bad mood while I'm taping my special.

170
00:09:56.640 --> 00:09:57.840
So let's calm down. Now.

171
00:09:57.841 --> 00:10:00.450
These are all the things that are going on in my head while these are just

172
00:10:00.451 --> 00:10:02.910
having a good time watching the football game right there. Screaming.

173
00:10:02.940 --> 00:10:07.320
Now I didn't did I mention that guy that the guy's screaming at the TV

174
00:10:07.740 --> 00:10:12.060
also were in tail coats and top hats?

175
00:10:14.400 --> 00:10:17.280
Did I mention it? Well, they were,

176
00:10:18.900 --> 00:10:23.370
I don't know. Why were there two guys dressed the same? Yeah.

177
00:10:23.940 --> 00:10:27.570
Well, I guess they were working for the hotel or some other hotel or some.

178
00:10:28.650 --> 00:10:29.460
I have no idea,

179
00:10:29.460 --> 00:10:33.960
but there were so loud screaming at the team and other people were like,

180
00:10:33.961 --> 00:10:36.780
what the is going on now? I got,

181
00:10:36.870 --> 00:10:39.630
I got mad and I was genuinely thinking,

182
00:10:39.720 --> 00:10:43.350
am I one of these people that can't stand clapping? And then I thought, well,

183
00:10:43.351 --> 00:10:45.810
no, I'm not. But if I was,

184
00:10:46.410 --> 00:10:49.080
I would just stay home or go and deal with it.

185
00:10:52.160 --> 00:10:54.950
People like this are just never going to, that's not going to happen.

186
00:10:55.700 --> 00:10:59.120
What are they saying that this is what they want. They're like, well, we think,

187
00:10:59.121 --> 00:11:01.550
you know, people should literally, it's like,

188
00:11:02.540 --> 00:11:05.090
why don't they just get rid of their arms? And on, in all honesty,

189
00:11:05.091 --> 00:11:08.900
I think that it would be a better society if they, uh, get rid of their arms,

190
00:11:09.410 --> 00:11:11.540
you know, this way they don't have to, they can't clap. Right.

191
00:11:11.750 --> 00:11:15.860
And then people can go, you bend it too far, one way. And by the way, this,

192
00:11:16.160 --> 00:11:20.660
this just made probably, I don't know how big it is.

193
00:11:20.690 --> 00:11:25.190
55,000 people saw this on the good morning Britain show. Uh, so out of 55,000,

194
00:11:25.191 --> 00:11:29.120
I would say it probably made maybe 150 people sway their vote to Trump,

195
00:11:30.860 --> 00:11:35.240
you know? So I just, I mean,

196
00:11:35.241 --> 00:11:38.750
so silly. And then I looked on the girl's Twitter and she was like, well,

197
00:11:38.751 --> 00:11:40.580
I'm getting properly dragged on, on tie. Yeah.

198
00:11:40.610 --> 00:11:42.350
You're getting properly dragged spreading.
