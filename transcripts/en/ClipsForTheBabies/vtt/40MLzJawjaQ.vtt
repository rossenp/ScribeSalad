00:00:01.530 --> 00:00:06.360
<v 0>Uh, I'm in a good mood and nobody can stop me,</v>

2
00:00:06.361 --> 00:00:09.390
man. What if you said that and then killed yourself,

3
00:00:10.590 --> 00:00:14.400
that would be amazing. I'm in a good mood and nobody could stop me

4
00:00:18.830 --> 00:00:22.910
dude. One time I was at a dinner with my friend. No,

5
00:00:22.911 --> 00:00:26.510
it was lunch as that when my friend and we were four of us and,

6
00:00:28.790 --> 00:00:33.230
and we were eating and he just, and we're all laughing. He's like, ah, yeah.

7
00:00:33.231 --> 00:00:36.170
And he took a pill and drank water and I said, Oh, taking cyanide.

8
00:00:36.171 --> 00:00:39.770
And he spit the water out everywhere.

9
00:00:40.610 --> 00:00:43.820
And that's a funny joke for that that you can do every time someone's just

10
00:00:43.821 --> 00:00:46.010
taking pills and they don't look like I mentioned ticket, but dude,

11
00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:49.670
if you're at a restaurant and you take pills, you gotta be like, yo guys,

12
00:00:49.671 --> 00:00:50.540
I'm gonna take a pill right now.

13
00:00:50.541 --> 00:00:54.380
You can't just casually pop pills in your mouth and.

14
00:00:55.130 --> 00:00:58.820
There's laws. Um,

15
00:01:01.190 --> 00:01:05.600
yeah. There's laws, dude. Suck me off the completion, dude. Okay.

16
00:01:09.620 --> 00:01:13.070
Uh, what about actually before, even that

17
00:01:14.900 --> 00:01:16.820
here, here's something that I'm not doing. Okay.

18
00:01:17.090 --> 00:01:18.500
And everyone can stop asking me.

19
00:01:18.620 --> 00:01:21.650
Cause I'm getting real comedians asking me to do this like comedians that are a,

20
00:01:22.040 --> 00:01:25.010
even like do a headlining gigs and. I'm not.

21
00:01:25.011 --> 00:01:29.960
And you can stop texting me if you know me personally or asking me

22
00:01:29.961 --> 00:01:34.910
if you don't on Twitter or whatever the or DM-ing me to

23
00:01:34.911 --> 00:01:38.510
do a zoom comedy show. Okay.

24
00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:41.990
I'm not doing a zoom comedy show.

25
00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:45.380
Do you know why? Two reasons?

26
00:01:49.190 --> 00:01:53.390
That's a horrible idea. Number one.

27
00:01:54.080 --> 00:01:57.980
And number two, I have a successful podcast.

28
00:01:58.520 --> 00:02:02.930
So I have an outlet for an outlet for it outlet.

29
00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:08.270
Hm I'm. Whenever I mistake a word,

30
00:02:08.300 --> 00:02:12.650
I usually don't go back and say it and I usually don't go back and correct it.

31
00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:17.330
That's the word now. Okay. Outlet.

32
00:02:19.130 --> 00:02:21.050
I don't even understand what, what was I saying about it?

33
00:02:21.080 --> 00:02:25.190
What was the word outlet? What was that? Outlet? Outlet outlet, dude.

34
00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:30.860
I have an outlet. I have a outlet and it's my part.

35
00:02:31.310 --> 00:02:34.430
It's my part. Attest to the stand. Me dude.

36
00:02:35.030 --> 00:02:39.590
I have an outlet and it's much harder to cast said Irish, dude.

37
00:02:41.480 --> 00:02:44.750
What are words? Anyway, dude, I beat like Kanye.

38
00:02:46.430 --> 00:02:51.380
So I'm not doing a zoom comedy show, man, because it's going to be awful.

39
00:02:52.520 --> 00:02:57.410
All right. I have my podcast. It's all set up. Um, I'm up here doing my,

40
00:02:58.430 --> 00:03:01.240
dude. I get good thing thing. I got a guy who texted me nine times.

41
00:03:01.241 --> 00:03:04.120
Do you want me to do the one to this? This is no,

42
00:03:05.920 --> 00:03:09.460
I'm fine with doing just no standup until standup comes back round.

43
00:03:11.560 --> 00:03:16.470
Um, because dude, I don't understand too.

44
00:03:16.680 --> 00:03:19.420
There's like, well, yeah, but you already are successful. Like these comedians,

45
00:03:19.421 --> 00:03:22.720
they're like, well we're doing a zoom call. Just start a podcast, dude.

46
00:03:23.980 --> 00:03:28.690
Just talk. Vice vice dude, which welcome,

47
00:03:28.820 --> 00:03:30.760
which is just vice. You know,

48
00:03:32.860 --> 00:03:37.390
they did a standup comedy in the age of, I walked,

49
00:03:37.420 --> 00:03:41.410
I went down to find out standup County in the age of social distancing.

50
00:03:42.310 --> 00:03:44.500
I have glasses. So they went to go.

51
00:03:45.700 --> 00:03:49.320
<v 1>Stay at home comedy show. I kind of don't want to do material right now. Cause</v>

52
00:03:50.820 --> 00:03:54.360
jokes BC like before Corona thinking that.

53
00:03:54.750 --> 00:03:58.230
<v 0>It's not even that these people, aren't funny. I'm sure they are funny.</v>

54
00:03:58.830 --> 00:04:02.610
This is just not the medium for it. No knock on these.

55
00:04:03.630 --> 00:04:06.150
These people are probably talented if they get on the stage,

56
00:04:06.180 --> 00:04:07.260
I'm sure that could crush.

57
00:04:07.710 --> 00:04:12.300
And I also like feel for these because I remember doing stand-ups starting out

58
00:04:12.390 --> 00:04:14.190
and whatever. I don't know if these real are starting out or not,

59
00:04:14.490 --> 00:04:16.920
but like vice did a whole thing on.

60
00:04:17.160 --> 00:04:17.800
<v 1>Canceled.</v>

61
00:04:17.800 --> 00:04:22.230
Would you be down to try just doing it streaming like a live show,

62
00:04:22.231 --> 00:04:26.280
but it would just be us doing it to our computer and like no laughter no

63
00:04:26.281 --> 00:04:28.350
audience and no feedback. Just a podcast.

64
00:04:29.250 --> 00:04:33.210
<v 0>So just say it's a podcast. This guy looks cool.</v>

65
00:04:33.570 --> 00:04:34.920
I would hang with this guy.

66
00:04:38.790 --> 00:04:43.200
Um, but it's just not gonna, it's not going to be funny if you do

67
00:04:45.390 --> 00:04:47.610
it. It's not going to be funny if you do. That's the thing, man,

68
00:04:47.640 --> 00:04:50.100
everything is different. Like I always like,

69
00:04:51.660 --> 00:04:53.610
I always like try to make it

70
00:04:56.190 --> 00:04:57.930
like Instagram. I'm not going to do Instagram.

71
00:04:57.931 --> 00:05:00.450
Like I'm going to do this podcast. I'm not going to do this podcast.

72
00:05:00.451 --> 00:05:03.750
I'm going to do my standup. I always say this. It's all for different mediums.

73
00:05:03.751 --> 00:05:05.850
Some people like men Instagram, they don't like my podcast.

74
00:05:06.090 --> 00:05:10.680
So people like my standup, they don't like my Twitter because it's different.

75
00:05:11.910 --> 00:05:15.450
And it has to be because it's a different medium. If I were to do my tweets,

76
00:05:15.451 --> 00:05:18.630
like my standup, my Twitter will be awful. My Twitter is awful,

77
00:05:18.930 --> 00:05:21.480
but you know what I mean? It's like, um,

78
00:05:24.270 --> 00:05:27.570
you know, I, it, it's just, it's just,

79
00:05:27.571 --> 00:05:32.070
you can't do the thing you want to do so much

80
00:05:33.480 --> 00:05:36.720
in this, in this medium. That way.

81
00:05:40.500 --> 00:05:43.110
It's also like, okay,

82
00:05:45.660 --> 00:05:49.860
Rona. It's okay to not be funny,

83
00:05:50.310 --> 00:05:54.870
like as a comedian or not be rip wrongly. Hilarious dude.

84
00:05:54.871 --> 00:05:56.610
When I started this podcast, I didn't think it was going to,

85
00:05:56.611 --> 00:05:59.270
I didn't know if gonna be funny or not. I just thought gonna be funny to me.

86
00:06:00.190 --> 00:06:02.090
You got to do what makes yourself laugh, man.

87
00:06:02.330 --> 00:06:05.000
You have to do what makes yourself laugh. That's what I do.

88
00:06:05.600 --> 00:06:10.490
That's all I do is, and I'm I, you know, this is an advice or what,

89
00:06:10.491 --> 00:06:14.240
but like zoom, this zoom comedy. It's gotta go, dude.

90
00:06:14.780 --> 00:06:16.730
It's not funny. I mean,

91
00:06:18.830 --> 00:06:21.290
the best comedians can do it and it won't be good.

92
00:06:24.580 --> 00:06:27.010
It's just, it's not the medium for it.

93
00:06:28.870 --> 00:06:32.530
Do a podcast. Yes. This wouldn't work on stage.

94
00:06:33.880 --> 00:06:36.970
This is me bullshitting. If I were to come out and have a thing,

95
00:06:36.971 --> 00:06:38.620
like I'm going to talk about this. I'm gonna do this material.

96
00:06:38.621 --> 00:06:41.500
I'm gonna do that material. It will be atrocious, dude.

97
00:06:41.620 --> 00:06:45.310
You'd sniff it in a minute. You hang up on me. This is a phone call,

98
00:06:45.880 --> 00:06:48.820
but you'd click out of the YouTube man. You'd turn it off Spotify.

99
00:06:48.880 --> 00:06:53.590
You'd say get out iTunes podcast. This is the podcast.

100
00:06:53.591 --> 00:06:57.130
This is not stand up. Comedy, big believer in that man.

101
00:06:59.140 --> 00:07:04.060
Um, anyway, do it via zoom comedy vise.

102
00:07:05.770 --> 00:07:08.890
I just let me see. Let's look up some of these zoom comedy shows, um,

103
00:07:12.810 --> 00:07:13.643
[inaudible] look,

104
00:07:14.110 --> 00:07:17.170
I'm sure they're successful and funny and and I'm sure they're good on stage.

105
00:07:17.530 --> 00:07:20.860
I feel for these dudes, I get it. It's a rough time, but this is not the answer.

106
00:07:22.300 --> 00:07:26.170
Um, zoom, let's just Google zoom comedy show.

107
00:07:27.640 --> 00:07:31.840
Somebody was like, dude, somebody hit me up and they were like, Hey, uh, hit me.

108
00:07:32.470 --> 00:07:36.670
Uh, you could do a set and we'll pay you thousands of dollars.

109
00:07:37.210 --> 00:07:41.080
And, and it, you know, we don't record it and leave it up. It's just live.

110
00:07:41.081 --> 00:07:41.914
And I'm like, dude,

111
00:07:41.950 --> 00:07:44.830
you don't think someone's going to record it and put it up in and I'm going to

112
00:07:44.910 --> 00:07:47.350
go get a huge. Okay.

113
00:07:49.900 --> 00:07:53.830
Improv comedy show by eight. That's another thing I don't get is, uh,

114
00:07:57.010 --> 00:08:01.720
um, I watched, first of all,

115
00:08:01.721 --> 00:08:05.560
I watched, uh Middleditch and Schwartz and it was funny. They're funny.

116
00:08:05.561 --> 00:08:09.760
Those guys are funny. Um, that's like the best version of that to me,

117
00:08:10.210 --> 00:08:14.740
but long form improv to me is so weird.

118
00:08:15.430 --> 00:08:20.200
Like it's just, I mean, I get that, you know,

119
00:08:20.201 --> 00:08:24.220
people are, uh, the people who do it are funny.

120
00:08:25.630 --> 00:08:26.710
I don't know if it's for me.

121
00:08:27.070 --> 00:08:30.580
I want to try to do long form and improv to see what it is like,

122
00:08:31.090 --> 00:08:33.970
but I just don't. They're just like, so what's up with a,

123
00:08:36.130 --> 00:08:40.240
give me a suggestion. Anybody got a suggestion and they're like, sure.

124
00:08:40.450 --> 00:08:45.330
Police. Okay. All right, please. Okay. And does anybody have a time?

126
00:08:50.320 --> 00:08:54.760
Um, does anybody have an object? A chicken. Shar. Shar. Okay.

They want to just throw out there a full four Wheeler. I can't, I can't sit.

134
00:09:25.170 --> 00:09:29.550
It's a police officer. Listen, it says it's a four, four,

135
00:09:29.820 --> 00:09:33.750

And see, there we go. Hi, I'm Lisa for chicken.

E my.

00:09:56.540 --> 00:09:59.480
So don't come at me with this boring for me is actually,

142
00:09:59.890 --> 00:10:02.840
unfortunately if you look at the cat or if you look at the uprights [inaudible]

143
00:10:03.170 --> 00:10:08.090

144
00:10:11.900 --> 00:10:14.870

become right-wing, you know, I want to become right wing.

146
00:10:23.300 --> 00:10:24.133
Cancel me,

148
00:10:30.381 --> 00:10:34.460
can dip out of the shadows. Good. I have a cough. Yes.

149
00:10:37.760 --> 00:10:39.200
Um, so.
