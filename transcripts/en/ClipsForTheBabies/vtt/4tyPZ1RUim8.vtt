1
00:00:00.330 --> 00:00:03.150
<v 0>So anyway, uh, I watched tiger King</v>

2
00:00:05.870 --> 00:00:09.050
and it was about Theo because that guy,

3
00:00:09.560 --> 00:00:12.200
if I had to pick any friend that it looks like it's, it's Theo, people are like,

4
00:00:12.230 --> 00:00:16.580
Oh David spade played them in a, what do you call it?

5
00:00:17.510 --> 00:00:20.900
Um, Joe Joe dirt. And I'm just like,

6
00:00:20.930 --> 00:00:25.880
no Theo Von is him though. Period. Um,

7
00:00:27.320 --> 00:00:32.150
and so I saw tiger King and everyone on tiger King. Uh,

8
00:00:32.180 --> 00:00:36.800
I have a question for you. What the is wrong with you? You're morons everyone,

9
00:00:36.890 --> 00:00:41.480
every single person on tiger King is a moron and yeah,

10
00:00:41.481 --> 00:00:44.720
it's funny. And Oh yeah. Watch your show. And can you believe it?

11
00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:48.260
And at arms length, you're like, wow, that's amazing that life,

12
00:00:48.380 --> 00:00:52.640
but those people that are living that life they're in this world,

13
00:00:52.910 --> 00:00:53.960
you could bump into him.

14
00:00:54.650 --> 00:00:58.940
And that's a problem because those people are idiots,

15
00:00:59.630 --> 00:01:02.060
everyone right down to it from a,

16
00:01:02.090 --> 00:01:06.140
the tiger King to the other dude who wear the bandana and the hat by the way,

17
00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:10.490
where one headpiece, especially if you're white,

18
00:01:11.300 --> 00:01:15.050
why does everyone in the movie too? In the shows, they all like,

19
00:01:15.290 --> 00:01:17.330
look like they would jerk off outside of affliction,

20
00:01:17.331 --> 00:01:20.090
just staring in the front store. Storefront,

21
00:01:21.800 --> 00:01:24.650
just jerking off at the new affliction designs are, Oh,

22
00:01:24.651 --> 00:01:28.100
I can't wait till I come out with the affliction is the worst clothing of all

23
00:01:28.101 --> 00:01:32.870
time, by the way, it's so bad. Why does it,

24
00:01:32.900 --> 00:01:35.030
why do you need to have tattoos on your shirt?

25
00:01:35.870 --> 00:01:40.580
Why can't you just have them on your body? Everything well affliction ever made,

26
00:01:40.581 --> 00:01:44.810
it looks like it was a tattoo put on a shirt of, uh,

27
00:01:44.930 --> 00:01:45.890
like my tattoos. Like,

28
00:01:46.040 --> 00:01:48.860
it'll be like an Eagle on fire with the word affliction over it.

29
00:01:50.660 --> 00:01:54.950
Or some dragon. God, that guy.

30
00:01:55.090 --> 00:01:59.600
How about the guy who was like the big potato with the long

31
00:01:59.601 --> 00:02:04.310
hair? That was just like, why do, how come everybody? Why,

32
00:02:04.370 --> 00:02:08.600
why does everybody who have tigers want to as many

33
00:02:08.990 --> 00:02:13.310
people around them? What is that about everyone? There is like, well,

34
00:02:13.311 --> 00:02:14.630
I have I roll around with them.

35
00:02:15.140 --> 00:02:18.200
big potato guy that has his beard was his goatee was white.

36
00:02:18.201 --> 00:02:21.890
And he had the long hair and he, he told the documentary crew cut once.

37
00:02:22.550 --> 00:02:26.900
He was like, and that's how it is cut. I think we got it that long potato guy.

38
00:02:27.770 --> 00:02:30.230
He just like,

39
00:02:32.450 --> 00:02:35.930
even though I was like, well, I have five girls that just follow me around.

40
00:02:35.931 --> 00:02:39.640
Why do they all, why just be a cult leader? What,

41
00:02:39.641 --> 00:02:43.910
what what's with the tigers? These guys are like, step one,

42
00:02:44.030 --> 00:02:47.720
get tigers. Step two. all the girls.

43
00:02:49.520 --> 00:02:52.550
No, except for the tiger King guy was just like

44
00:02:54.080 --> 00:02:58.280
making straight dudes. him. Trying to pretend like the,

45
00:02:59.620 --> 00:03:04.210
you mean married two straight dudes and them and. And they were just like,

46
00:03:04.211 --> 00:03:06.430
I'm not gay. I don't know. I just, how,

47
00:03:06.730 --> 00:03:10.240
how dumb do you have to be to let a guy,

48
00:03:10.720 --> 00:03:15.010
if you're not gay, make you be like, ah, it.

49
00:03:15.160 --> 00:03:19.930
I'll marry him and just them for a bunch of years. When the guy showed up,

50
00:03:19.931 --> 00:03:20.651
when his husband,

51
00:03:20.651 --> 00:03:24.070
his first husband showed up and they did the floating head of him just

52
00:03:24.071 --> 00:03:26.620
interviewing him. He had no shirt on

53
00:03:28.660 --> 00:03:30.940
the directors must have been like a pig and. When that happened,

54
00:03:31.120 --> 00:03:34.060
if that happened to me, I would have been like, okay, let's get the guy.

55
00:03:34.061 --> 00:03:36.220
And he was like, all right, where do you want to go? And I'll be like, Oh, cool.

56
00:03:36.221 --> 00:03:37.780
You want to get dressed? And he'd be like, what do you mean? I'll be like,

57
00:03:37.840 --> 00:03:39.940
Oh no, nevermind, no, sit down, go ahead and show it off. That's fine.

58
00:03:41.740 --> 00:03:46.030
Hair all over his body. I feel kind of bad for some of these guys.

59
00:03:46.031 --> 00:03:49.450
Like that guy felt kind of bad for, but just how stupid do you have to be?

60
00:03:49.451 --> 00:03:54.370
To be not gay, but a guy and let him you for nine years. How dumb is that,

61
00:03:54.371 --> 00:03:55.204
dude?

62
00:04:00.210 --> 00:04:01.530
I mean, I'm straight.

63
00:04:02.190 --> 00:04:06.930
What would have to go down for me to and let a

64
00:04:06.931 --> 00:04:10.980
guy rail me for nine years?

65
00:04:11.580 --> 00:04:13.200
What co what would have to go down?

66
00:04:16.230 --> 00:04:21.120
I'd have to be in prison. I've said a long time ago. People are like,

67
00:04:21.150 --> 00:04:22.860
Oh, how long, you know, sometimes you talk to your friends.

68
00:04:22.861 --> 00:04:24.630
How long would it take for you to start guys?

69
00:04:24.631 --> 00:04:26.010
What would it take if you were in PR,

70
00:04:26.370 --> 00:04:29.580
what would it take for you to take me to be in prison for eight days,

71
00:04:29.640 --> 00:04:32.370
eight days. That's it? That's how long a week goes by. And I'm like, all right,

72
00:04:32.371 --> 00:04:36.330
I guess I gotta them. I gotta, I gotta guys with this was the deal for how long,

73
00:04:36.390 --> 00:04:39.180
how long to would I have to be in jail for like,

74
00:04:39.270 --> 00:04:40.290
if I was going to get out in a year,

75
00:04:40.291 --> 00:04:41.730
I could probably go a year without doing it.

76
00:04:41.910 --> 00:04:44.790
But if I was going to be in jail for three years, eight days, eight days,

77
00:04:44.791 --> 00:04:45.720
it would take for me to guys.

78
00:04:45.720 --> 00:04:47.460
And then two years later I'd get out and they'd be like, what happened?

79
00:04:47.580 --> 00:04:50.580
I'd be like eight days lasted. A bunch of guys. Now let's go get these checks.

80
00:04:51.720 --> 00:04:55.860
That's how it will be for me. But to just straight up, be like, okay,

81
00:04:55.890 --> 00:04:57.480
I'll marry a guy because of his tigers,

82
00:04:57.481 --> 00:04:59.430
even though I'm straight and let him me for nine years,

83
00:05:04.470 --> 00:05:05.370
just insane.

84
00:05:05.490 --> 00:05:08.520
I thought it's so weird that these guys just want to get these tigers.

85
00:05:08.760 --> 00:05:11.940
And then the guy at the end with the affliction shirt and the two hats was just

86
00:05:11.941 --> 00:05:16.080
like, well, I got her pregnant and we're going to get a nanny and guess what?

87
00:05:16.230 --> 00:05:17.460
And showed her the picture of the nanny.

88
00:05:17.461 --> 00:05:19.710
And the nanny looks like a girl that will be on Tik TOK.

89
00:05:19.711 --> 00:05:23.490
And you're just like what? She's just like, and he's like,

90
00:05:23.520 --> 00:05:27.030
I got to pick the nanny. He's just going to the nanny while his girl's pregnant.

91
00:05:27.270 --> 00:05:29.870
And then he's like, we're going to pop this baby out of her. And then,

92
00:05:29.871 --> 00:05:31.140
then we're going to get her in the gym.

93
00:05:31.440 --> 00:05:32.790
<v 1>Oh.</v>

94
00:05:35.280 --> 00:05:39.350
<v 0>The Texas city. And our said, Hey. And I said, Hey</v>

95
00:05:41.550 --> 00:05:45.720
sir, toxic masculinity. And I don't even believe in that dumb.

96
00:05:47.340 --> 00:05:51.210
Anytime a guy coughs somebody like that's toxic masculinity nowadays.

97
00:05:51.960 --> 00:05:53.700
You know what, thank God for the coronavirus.

98
00:05:53.701 --> 00:05:57.650
At least people aren't getting canceled anymore for for just farting.

99
00:05:59.780 --> 00:06:02.990
I swear to God, dude, I'm not even gonna mention it.

100
00:06:02.991 --> 00:06:04.970
But one of my buddies got outed for some.

101
00:06:05.690 --> 00:06:08.000
And then the coronavirus happened and everyone forgot about that.

102
00:06:08.001 --> 00:06:09.530
That dude's like, hell yeah.

103
00:06:10.820 --> 00:06:13.310
He's like a bunch of tens of thousands of people died. That's fine.

104
00:06:13.311 --> 00:06:17.870
But at least I get to do a deal. Now, the toxicity.

105
00:06:18.250 --> 00:06:20.800
<v 2>Or Sadie and or sad. Hey,</v>

106
00:06:25.750 --> 00:06:26.650
unbelievable, dude.

107
00:06:29.020 --> 00:06:30.100
<v 0>That made me laugh.</v>

108
00:06:30.220 --> 00:06:34.480
Do it about the tiger King when he was just like gonna get the best part about

109
00:06:34.481 --> 00:06:38.320
tiger King though. And if you tell me, this is wrong, go yourself.

110
00:06:38.321 --> 00:06:43.060
We don't get along the best thing in tiger King.

111
00:06:43.150 --> 00:06:43.511
First of all,

112
00:06:43.511 --> 00:06:47.740
the second best thing in and tiger King was when he was at the funeral.

113
00:06:47.890 --> 00:06:49.210
When his, when his, when his,

114
00:06:49.450 --> 00:06:53.920
one of his husbands died and he started talking about how

115
00:06:55.390 --> 00:06:57.990
the dead guy would put his balls in his face whenever he needed.

116
00:06:58.000 --> 00:07:00.490
And that's why he loved them and, that was the second best.

117
00:07:00.700 --> 00:07:04.480
But the best part was when he was like, okay, now I headed and then.

118
00:07:04.630 --> 00:07:09.100
<v 2>Started singing is terrible country music. Oh,</v>

119
00:07:10.600 --> 00:07:14.380
okay. I mean, imagine your friend dies. Imagine your lover dies in your life.

120
00:07:16.020 --> 00:07:20.560
<v 0>Uh, man, missed him so much. I miss him so much.</v>

121
00:07:20.950 --> 00:07:25.210
He was so great. Anytime I was down, he'd put it. He'd put his balls in my face.

122
00:07:26.080 --> 00:07:30.820
<v 2>It's not unusual to be mad at anyone [inaudible]</v>

123
00:07:31.870 --> 00:07:34.600
Oh, okay.

124
00:07:34.750 --> 00:07:37.180
<v 0>Yeah, man. I just got to tell you,</v>

125
00:07:38.590 --> 00:07:42.760
we all miss him and it sucks. He was a real standup guy.

126
00:07:43.720 --> 00:07:46.580
Meaning he'd stand up and put his balls over my eyes whenever I.

127
00:07:47.370 --> 00:07:49.510
<v 2>It's not unusual to be.</v>

128
00:07:53.170 --> 00:07:54.003
[inaudible].

129
00:07:55.000 --> 00:07:57.310
<v 0>God I miss my wife used to her gash at.</v>

130
00:07:57.430 --> 00:08:01.570
<v 2>It. It's not unusual to be [inaudible].</v>

131
00:08:08.140 --> 00:08:11.470
<v 0>Ah, man, I can't believe my wife has gone.</v>

132
00:08:12.310 --> 00:08:15.940
It's so sad. Favorite thing about it was when she used to kiss my. All.

133
00:08:15.940 --> 00:08:16.773
<v 2>I had it.</v>

134
00:08:22.210 --> 00:08:23.043
Holy.

135
00:08:23.770 --> 00:08:25.510
<v 0>Favorite thing about it was when she used to pee on me.</v>

136
00:08:25.670 --> 00:08:27.700
<v 2>Not unusual to be</v>

137
00:08:29.930 --> 00:08:33.160
[inaudible] I keep forgetting. I'm not in love anymore.

138
00:08:37.540 --> 00:08:39.970
Wow. I'm losing my mind. Nobody's in this room.

139
00:08:42.910 --> 00:08:47.350
<v 0>Dude. That's the best part of tiger King man. Oh man. Miss my husband.</v>

140
00:08:47.351 --> 00:08:48.184
He used to my boy.

141
00:08:48.370 --> 00:08:52.060
<v 2>Here we go. One and a two and a three. It's not unusual.</v>

142
00:08:52.660 --> 00:08:55.890
<v 0>People get mad at me for milk and jokes. Go yourself. I'll do it.</v>

143
00:08:55.920 --> 00:08:59.370
I'll do this whole episode to the end. I'll do different things. Oh,

144
00:08:59.371 --> 00:09:01.570
I used to love when he used to blast in my mouth.

145
00:09:02.330 --> 00:09:03.560
<v 2>It's not unusual.</v>

146
00:09:11.840 --> 00:09:13.280
<v 0>My favorite is when he used to boot cocky me.</v>

147
00:09:14.780 --> 00:09:18.500
<v 2>I keep forgetting. It's not, [inaudible].</v>

00:09:21.500 --> 00:09:25.820
<v 0>Just, I miss my husband. He used to suck my.</v>

149
00:09:31.610 --> 00:09:33.260
<v 2>[Inaudible] it kind of comes out.</v>
