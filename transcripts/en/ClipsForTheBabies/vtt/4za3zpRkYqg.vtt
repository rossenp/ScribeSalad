00:00:01.860 --> 00:00:02.693
<v 0>Uh,</v>

2
00:00:05.390 --> 00:00:08.090
I was thinking about a story when I was a kid, this was the,

3
00:00:08.390 --> 00:00:11.930
this is how you know, I'm down, dude. I'm down for my homeys.

4
00:00:12.320 --> 00:00:16.070
And this is how you know, I'm down for my homeys is because

5
00:00:18.200 --> 00:00:22.460
when I was boy, I must've been in fifth grade,

6
00:00:25.250 --> 00:00:29.690
a kid came in to class

7
00:00:30.530 --> 00:00:34.070
and it was a new student. We had a new student when I was in fifth grade.

8
00:00:34.520 --> 00:00:38.480
His name was Thomas. That's all I remember. I don't remember his last name.

9
00:00:38.630 --> 00:00:41.210
Didn't call himself, Tom. And name was Thomas.

10
00:00:41.690 --> 00:00:46.130
And he was the kind of guy who looked like he should be graduating college.

11
00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:50.450
You know how sometimes the kid is just like, there's a kid in your school,

12
00:00:50.870 --> 00:00:54.890
in your class and you're in fifth grade and he just looks like one of the kids'

13
00:00:54.891 --> 00:00:59.270
dads, he was wirey and tall was this black dude.

14
00:01:00.110 --> 00:01:03.650
Nice looking, you know, Thomas

15
00:01:05.180 --> 00:01:05.870
me,

16
00:01:05.870 --> 00:01:09.440
I always be pre-funded the new people because I wanted to learn all about them

17
00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:13.130
because let's face it. The everyday was mundane to.

18
00:01:14.450 --> 00:01:18.260
So I started talking to Mo uh, Thomas Thomas turns out,

19
00:01:19.800 --> 00:01:22.280
had so many penthouses and Playboys and.

20
00:01:23.510 --> 00:01:26.750
And I didn't know why when I was fifth, when I was in fifth grade, I thought,

21
00:01:26.780 --> 00:01:29.930
Oh, this guy must just have a up parents. Right.

22
00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:31.520
Because how does he get access to this?

23
00:01:32.030 --> 00:01:36.890
But he'd come and he'd bring the pieces of the pieces of paper from

24
00:01:36.891 --> 00:01:40.430
penthouse. And it was the first time I ever saw like, you know,

25
00:01:41.090 --> 00:01:44.540
and I seen before, but like I saw girls like fingering themselves and stuff

26
00:01:46.040 --> 00:01:48.410
on never get a Disney movie. And so, um,

27
00:01:48.440 --> 00:01:53.090
I saw him doing that or I saw him giving out the things and,

28
00:01:53.180 --> 00:01:57.290
and he was giving, he gave one to me and I was like, Whoa.

29
00:01:57.770 --> 00:02:00.440
And I remember feeling like, wow, this looks weird, but I like it.

30
00:02:00.470 --> 00:02:03.950
But also it's weird. Cause you know, those girls, they didn't look natural.

31
00:02:03.951 --> 00:02:08.660
They had really big boobs and their look like fried butterflies and their hair

32
00:02:08.690 --> 00:02:11.150
was all teased out. Like I've never seen girls like that. You know?

33
00:02:11.151 --> 00:02:14.630
And this was even in New Jersey when the girl's hairs in the eighties were nutso

34
00:02:16.370 --> 00:02:21.050
teachers and. Anyway, uh, I was like, Whoa man. And he was like, yeah,

35
00:02:21.051 --> 00:02:23.360
he's like, I got more where that came from. And I was like, really?

36
00:02:23.361 --> 00:02:25.490
And he was like, you want me to bring them? And I was like, yup. He's like, Oh,

37
00:02:25.500 --> 00:02:29.150
I gotta do is bring my, is give me your snacks tomorrow. And I was like,

38
00:02:30.530 --> 00:02:32.780
cool. Okay.

39
00:02:34.040 --> 00:02:38.780
So the next day I was like, Hey dad, can I get extra potato skins in my thing,

40
00:02:38.810 --> 00:02:41.720
we had the little planter, peanut potato skins, things that we used to have.

41
00:02:42.890 --> 00:02:47.450
I used to get, I don't know if they still exist anymore. Uh, and, uh,

42
00:02:50.120 --> 00:02:52.910
and uh, and I came and it gave me more

43
00:02:54.800 --> 00:02:58.880
more, more nudes. Uh, and I would, and I would,

44
00:02:59.320 --> 00:03:02.230
and I would give him a potato skins and it would go down like a drug deal. Dude.

45
00:03:02.500 --> 00:03:04.990
I just give it, I just slide over the things.

46
00:03:06.810 --> 00:03:09.960
<v 1>And I need to get high, to get older some big time.</v>

47
00:03:10.080 --> 00:03:13.470
I would slide the over there. He would give me the, yo,

48
00:03:13.980 --> 00:03:16.650
we need to pump up the volume and this show will be playing in the back back.

49
00:03:17.400 --> 00:03:18.233
<v 0>You know what I mean?</v>

50
00:03:18.450 --> 00:03:21.330
And I can't play it or we'll get copyright infringement probably already got

51
00:03:21.600 --> 00:03:24.430
with it. But anyway, um, I will be sending,

52
00:03:24.440 --> 00:03:26.010
I w I would give him the and he would give me the.

53
00:03:26.400 --> 00:03:29.760
And then I go into the bathroom and I'd open up the magazines and I'd see it.

54
00:03:29.761 --> 00:03:33.240
And I would see new and new. And it was awesome, dude.

55
00:03:33.600 --> 00:03:36.000
And this is the time where I realized, I guess I'm straight.

56
00:03:36.001 --> 00:03:39.330
I didn't know about gay, but you know, if I had, I would have been like, can,

57
00:03:39.331 --> 00:03:42.420
I guess I'm straight. So I really liked it. And when I got home,

58
00:03:42.421 --> 00:03:44.550
I didn't want to keep it in the house. You know,

59
00:03:44.910 --> 00:03:48.510
like when I watched breaking bad and when Walter White is putting the money in

60
00:03:48.511 --> 00:03:52.830
the air vent, I'm like, bro, I would have found that in two seconds. Well luck.

61
00:03:53.010 --> 00:03:56.700
Luckily outside of my backyard down a little bit, there was a park,

62
00:03:57.090 --> 00:03:58.860
it was called Ghana called Brooke park.

63
00:03:59.550 --> 00:04:01.080
And I went with my friend matcher venting,

64
00:04:01.410 --> 00:04:03.540
and we took these photos of these girls post-season.

65
00:04:04.260 --> 00:04:09.120
And we went way back to the other end of the park and we would bury

66
00:04:09.121 --> 00:04:09.954
them.

67
00:04:10.950 --> 00:04:15.870
We would bury these pictures of and in baseball card collector,

68
00:04:16.410 --> 00:04:18.060
uh, holder things. Okay.

69
00:04:18.240 --> 00:04:22.470
And we buried them in a canopy that you would stack baseball cards in and we put

70
00:04:22.471 --> 00:04:25.980
something over it. So we could always go back to in a court,

71
00:04:26.160 --> 00:04:29.790
Brooke park and get into that can and look at those. And we didn't,

72
00:04:29.791 --> 00:04:32.460
we didn't even get, I don't even know if we got back then, you know,

73
00:04:32.461 --> 00:04:34.470
but we were just like, we would just open it up. Like it was treasure.

74
00:04:34.560 --> 00:04:38.430
It felt cool, dude. And sometimes I would go over there,

75
00:04:39.180 --> 00:04:41.730
just rolling on my dolo and go look at,

76
00:04:43.020 --> 00:04:45.390
put them back in the thing and go back and eat dinner with my family.

77
00:04:45.391 --> 00:04:47.780
And nobody knew, dude. And it was.

78
00:04:48.690 --> 00:04:51.450
<v 1>The mixer. Now the rap pop, it was dope.</v>

79
00:04:51.840 --> 00:04:55.200
<v 0>Dude, I felt good. And I felt sneaky. I felt like, you know,</v>

80
00:04:56.130 --> 00:05:00.630
like I had some going on and with this lasted for about a week or two

81
00:05:01.410 --> 00:05:06.150
and my dad said one day,

82
00:05:08.010 --> 00:05:10.980
Hey Chris, um,

83
00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:16.650
come into my office. And I said, okay,

84
00:05:16.740 --> 00:05:20.550
which was weird. He never did that. I went into his office and he says,

85
00:05:22.020 --> 00:05:24.960
um, Hey, is there a, um,

86
00:05:25.380 --> 00:05:28.770
a kid at school that's giving you nudes,

87
00:05:29.100 --> 00:05:31.620
like pictures of naked women. And I said,

88
00:05:34.140 --> 00:05:38.730
yeah, that's the kind of guy I am when I'm caught.

89
00:05:39.060 --> 00:05:43.050
I tell you what's up, that's it. I let the cards fall as they may.

90
00:05:43.470 --> 00:05:47.640
And he says, um, okay, uh,

91
00:05:48.240 --> 00:05:51.330
what are the pictures of? And I explained, plus he's in and stuff.

92
00:05:51.360 --> 00:05:52.980
Although I didn't say it like that when I was in fifth grade,

93
00:05:52.981 --> 00:05:57.320
I just naked women. And he said, okay. He said, uh,

94
00:05:57.830 --> 00:06:01.490
I want to know what these pictures are. Can you show me? And I said,

95
00:06:02.990 --> 00:06:05.360
um, okay.

96
00:06:08.420 --> 00:06:12.320
So I went to Yanika Brook park and rolling on my dolo,

97
00:06:12.920 --> 00:06:17.510
grabbed the things, went back up to the, um, dad's office,

98
00:06:18.710 --> 00:06:20.930
threw the pictures up on the thing. And I said, Hey, there are there like this.

99
00:06:20.931 --> 00:06:24.740
And he saw him and he said, okay, cool. That's all. And I said, really,

100
00:06:24.741 --> 00:06:28.310
am I in trouble? And he said, no. And I said, okay. He said,

101
00:06:28.311 --> 00:06:30.770
but you shouldn't be doing that stuff at school or whatever. And I said, okay,

102
00:06:30.771 --> 00:06:35.420
cool. And then, uh, I felt weird.

103
00:06:35.480 --> 00:06:37.490
I left the room. Didn't know how he knew it.

104
00:06:38.060 --> 00:06:42.740
And then a few days later he said to me, um, you know, uh,

105
00:06:44.510 --> 00:06:46.820
I said, how did you find out about that? And he said, you know,

106
00:06:47.000 --> 00:06:50.870
I've found out another dude who lived on the opposite.

107
00:06:50.871 --> 00:06:54.830
End of aganda codebook park, who was just a, rat. You know what I mean?

108
00:06:55.850 --> 00:06:59.150
A rat, like a piece of. Like his face was,

109
00:06:59.180 --> 00:07:01.970
he was one of those kids who had faces that were like,

110
00:07:01.971 --> 00:07:05.200
it was like pink and weird areas. You know, I'm talking about like, you know,

111
00:07:05.330 --> 00:07:06.380
and he was younger than me, by the way,

112
00:07:06.440 --> 00:07:10.160
a rat younger than me in like fourth or third grade.

113
00:07:10.161 --> 00:07:13.490
And he had the pink like that eczema. I don't really know what the it is.

114
00:07:13.491 --> 00:07:14.510
It's not eczema, but it's just like,

115
00:07:14.820 --> 00:07:19.370
it's like a high C it's like leftover high C on his face. Just a dirt,

116
00:07:19.700 --> 00:07:23.660
rat. And he said, I got a doorbell.

117
00:07:24.140 --> 00:07:28.730
He knocked on my, on the, he hit the doorbell and it was him good.

118
00:07:28.731 --> 00:07:33.290
Never came over. And he said, Hey, Mr. Dalea. I said, yeah. And he said, uh,

119
00:07:33.291 --> 00:07:35.960
I want you to know that Chris and Matt [inaudible],

120
00:07:35.960 --> 00:07:35.960
uh, are hiding dirty pictures, uh, outside the back of Yanacocha pro park,

121
00:07:35.960 --> 00:07:36.793
 near my house.

122
00:07:42.140 --> 00:07:46.370
And my dad said, Oh yeah. And he said, yeah.

123
00:07:47.630 --> 00:07:51.620
And then my dad said, he looked at this rat and said,

124
00:07:52.190 --> 00:07:56.960
so, and the rat said, Oh,

125
00:07:56.961 --> 00:07:59.570
I just thought you should know that, you know, cause they're naked.

126
00:07:59.780 --> 00:08:04.280
And my dad said again, so what? And he said, Oh, okay.

127
00:08:04.281 --> 00:08:08.060
And he turned around and my dad said, do you know why I said that, that way?

128
00:08:08.720 --> 00:08:11.870
I said why? He said, because he was trying to get you in trouble

129
00:08:14.680 --> 00:08:16.990
and I didn't want to let him have the satisfaction of it.

130
00:08:18.670 --> 00:08:21.490
So I acted like it wasn't a big deal. So he felt stupid.

131
00:08:24.400 --> 00:08:25.630
And I learned that then.

132
00:08:27.160 --> 00:08:31.660
And that's how I know now to be down as to your family,

133
00:08:32.770 --> 00:08:37.480
that one thing that happened definitely stuck with me forever.

134
00:08:37.840 --> 00:08:42.370
And that rat four fourth grader die, slow.

135
00:08:45.160 --> 00:08:49.090
My dad taught me a lesson. And then I said, well, why you want to see the pics?

136
00:08:49.091 --> 00:08:49.691
He said, well, honestly,

137
00:08:49.691 --> 00:08:51.670
the only reason why I just wanted to see the pig is why I want to make sure they

138
00:08:51.671 --> 00:08:52.121
were okay.

139
00:08:52.121 --> 00:08:54.370
And just if they could women and they weren't doing like weird stuff with

140
00:08:54.371 --> 00:08:57.540
animals or some, and I was like, Oh yeah, that makes sense.

141
00:08:59.430 --> 00:09:04.170
I love my dad. That's so dope. I can't wait to be on my kid's side.

142
00:09:05.220 --> 00:09:08.520
I mean, I am now, but like, I can't wait for that to happen. And some go down.

143
00:09:08.521 --> 00:09:12.240
And for me to look at some other kid that's trying to rat out of my rat. my, my,

144
00:09:12.280 --> 00:09:16.140
my, my, my son, and have him be like, and I may be like,

145
00:09:16.141 --> 00:09:19.950
so man, I learned, I learned that day. That was cool.

146
00:09:21.840 --> 00:09:24.600
And also turns out. I like the and too. So,

147
00:09:27.770 --> 00:09:31.820
um, anyway, I guess that dude, I forgot about that story.

148
00:09:31.821 --> 00:09:34.010
And I wanted to tell you on the podcast because I thought it was cool,

149
00:09:34.040 --> 00:09:37.250
but you gotta be down as to your family, man. You gotta be down as.

150
00:09:39.890 --> 00:09:43.280
Um, thanks guys. Look, it's a little weird doing this podcast all alone.

151
00:09:43.281 --> 00:09:47.180
I gotta be honest. Um, I'm trying to do my, my right.

152
00:09:47.181 --> 00:09:51.830
And be good by everyone and not be out and stay in my house alone, uh,

153
00:09:51.860 --> 00:09:55.910
doing this podcast and not have one fire or, um, uh,

154
00:09:56.090 --> 00:09:56.990
I've been getting rid of over here.

155
00:09:56.991 --> 00:09:58.580
So we're not coughing on each other who knows,

156
00:09:59.060 --> 00:10:01.700
but I'm doing this social distancing and I'm taking it seriously and you should

157
00:10:01.880 --> 00:10:04.370
too men. And if you live in Florida and if you're going to beat the beaches and,

158
00:10:04.850 --> 00:10:06.110
you're, you're a straight up piece of.
