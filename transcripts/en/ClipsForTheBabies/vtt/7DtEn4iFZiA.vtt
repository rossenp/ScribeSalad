1
00:00:00.750 --> 00:00:05.640
<v 0>We did the ads. What? Oh yeah, let's do this elder dude.</v>

2
00:00:06.120 --> 00:00:09.570
This was really cool. It touched me. We'll talk about good times and bad times.

3
00:00:09.571 --> 00:00:13.350
This is a good segue into this. We're bringing it. We're putting an elder here.

4
00:00:14.430 --> 00:00:19.050
Um, here, I got an email through my,

5
00:00:19.830 --> 00:00:21.480
uh, um,

6
00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:28.230
producer on the website. It's a log email.

7
00:00:28.231 --> 00:00:31.680
I'm going to try to shorten it up for you guys. But, uh, this really,

8
00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:34.440
this really touched me, dude. Uh, Hey Chris,

9
00:00:34.441 --> 00:00:38.460
so I have a different request for you at the title is subject is my brother.

10
00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:39.090
Hey Chris.

11
00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:42.000
So I have a different request for you and the congratulations podcast to get

12
00:00:42.001 --> 00:00:42.481
right to it.

13
00:00:42.481 --> 00:00:45.390
I'm coming to you to humbly request that my brother be given the honor of

14
00:00:45.391 --> 00:00:50.040
becoming an elder. Now, before I even go on here, let me stop right here.

15
00:00:50.400 --> 00:00:53.460
So many people are like, am I an elder yet? Do I get to be an elder?

16
00:00:53.490 --> 00:00:56.640
That's that takes you a few steps back from becoming an elder. Okay.

17
00:00:58.080 --> 00:01:00.720
If you're asking to become an elder, that's like, you want it too bad.

18
00:01:00.810 --> 00:01:03.120
It's like the karate guy. That's like, oh,

19
00:01:03.450 --> 00:01:06.210
what do I have to do to become a black belt? You're in the wrong state of mind,

20
00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:07.830
young grasshopper.

21
00:01:11.660 --> 00:01:14.210
If you have with your eyes on the prize,

22
00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:18.680
then you're not using one of your eyes for the journey. Now,

23
00:01:18.740 --> 00:01:23.720
am I a I'm practically Confucius how I said that.

24
00:01:24.620 --> 00:01:28.790
And that makes me just like him because I came up with a cool quote that I just

25
00:01:28.791 --> 00:01:31.460
said, but dude,

26
00:01:33.770 --> 00:01:38.360
actually think I heard that. So I'm not even that smart, but uh,

27
00:01:38.870 --> 00:01:43.760
this guy is humbly asking for his brother to become

28
00:01:43.761 --> 00:01:44.150
an elder,

29
00:01:44.150 --> 00:01:49.130
which he's putting his self himself aside and trying to have

30
00:01:49.131 --> 00:01:52.880
his brother become an elder elder. So when I listened to that,

31
00:01:52.881 --> 00:01:57.050
when I read that I go in my head, I go, I'm listening.

32
00:01:57.890 --> 00:01:58.640
Right?

33
00:01:58.640 --> 00:02:01.100
<v 1>Cause at first, Hey Chris, do I have a different request? I go,</v>

34
00:02:01.340 --> 00:02:04.100
I've heard it all. This is me. Hey Chris, do I have a different request for you?

35
00:02:04.310 --> 00:02:05.780
I've heard it all.

36
00:02:06.500 --> 00:02:08.750
<v 0>That's me to.</v>

37
00:02:08.750 --> 00:02:12.470
<v 1>Get right to you. I'm coming to you to humbly request. Yeah, sure, bro.</v>

38
00:02:12.471 --> 00:02:13.940
Here comes a joke. That's.

39
00:02:13.940 --> 00:02:18.050
<v 0>Me that my brother be given the honor of becoming an elder and then that's me</v>

40
00:02:18.051 --> 00:02:21.830
going? I'm listening. I'm like that. We pay meme.

41
00:02:22.700 --> 00:02:24.680
<v 2>Oh.</v>

42
00:02:26.360 --> 00:02:29.390
<v 0>If I could explain why I believe that you will understand that my intentions are</v>

43
00:02:29.391 --> 00:02:34.130
pure and true. I'm listening. He's talking like he's in a cult. I like that.

44
00:02:36.170 --> 00:02:39.560
As you have a similar relationship with your brother that is based on your

45
00:02:39.561 --> 00:02:40.970
complete admiration for each other.

46
00:02:45.500 --> 00:02:46.730
I love my brother.

47
00:02:48.470 --> 00:02:51.740
<v 1>I love my brother as much as Gerard, but loves Morgan free or free.</v>

48
00:02:51.741 --> 00:02:53.690
And the Angeles fallen series.

49
00:02:56.780 --> 00:03:01.750
<v 0>Um, my brother, Justin DEI is an air force, special tactics, airman listening.</v>

50
00:03:01.780 --> 00:03:04.870
<v 2>Because why? Because why?</v>

51
00:03:04.900 --> 00:03:09.000
Because he's protecting me literally.

52
00:03:11.460 --> 00:03:16.110
<v 0>With the 23rd STS. Do I know what it means? No, because I'm,</v>

53
00:03:16.290 --> 00:03:18.480
I'm really dumb, but maybe some of you out there do,

54
00:03:18.900 --> 00:03:22.980
he was deployed to an under dust undisclosed valley in Northeastern Afghanistan

55
00:03:23.070 --> 00:03:27.120
in April of 2018 where he was attached to a green beret unit. Okay.

56
00:03:27.450 --> 00:03:32.130
So he's a tough guy. Anytime I hear Greenbrae I think, okay.

57
00:03:32.190 --> 00:03:34.920
If I ever got in a fight with that guy, he would, he would murder me.

58
00:03:35.460 --> 00:03:39.660
They were tasked to clear the valley of enemy combatants from the valley and

59
00:03:39.661 --> 00:03:43.350
into Pakistan approximately a week before he was going to be sent back home.

60
00:03:43.770 --> 00:03:47.760
Justin stepped on an IED, which caused him to lose some fingers,

61
00:03:48.840 --> 00:03:53.300
his leg above the knee. But also he had lost so much blood.

62
00:03:53.400 --> 00:03:57.120
They had flat-lined for 90 seconds, which is,

63
00:03:58.830 --> 00:04:02.550
I mean, what do you even say about that? He survived.

64
00:04:04.920 --> 00:04:09.510
Thank God. But recovery was a horribly difficult process for him physically,

65
00:04:09.511 --> 00:04:10.261
but most importantly,

66
00:04:10.261 --> 00:04:15.030
mentally P T S D is a disgusting thing to see in someone you

67
00:04:15.031 --> 00:04:18.720
love, especially one that I spent my entire childhood with loving and admiring.

68
00:04:19.830 --> 00:04:21.960
I can't imagine, man. Uh,

69
00:04:21.990 --> 00:04:24.780
this is my thank you to you and the entire congratulations.

70
00:04:25.020 --> 00:04:26.220
Congratulations podcasts.

71
00:04:26.580 --> 00:04:29.460
Then he says some stuff about me that I'll skip because that just seems like I'm

72
00:04:29.461 --> 00:04:34.170
humble. Bragging. Uh, oh,

73
00:04:34.171 --> 00:04:37.530
this is cool. He introduced you to his spec ops team.

74
00:04:37.531 --> 00:04:40.500
And with that you have changed their vocabulary completely.

75
00:04:41.070 --> 00:04:45.030
I'm humbled here. Thank you. Uh, oh,

76
00:04:45.031 --> 00:04:49.620
he's trying to figure out a design for a congratulations tattoo. Uh,

77
00:04:51.180 --> 00:04:56.100
please know, I know, uh, yeah, that's too much nice stuff for me. Um,

78
00:04:57.270 --> 00:05:01.500
that's great, man. This is so you know, it's bittersweet. Uh,

79
00:05:01.530 --> 00:05:05.220
I read it all very, uh, you guy says, look, I love this. He says,

80
00:05:06.690 --> 00:05:07.523
um,

81
00:05:07.740 --> 00:05:11.220
but mostly I can't think of a better Christmas gift for him than you granting

82
00:05:11.221 --> 00:05:13.830
him an elder. Uh, I understand if not,

83
00:05:13.831 --> 00:05:16.110
because I know how you have chosen elders in the past and they were all

84
00:05:16.111 --> 00:05:18.540
deserving. Thank you for reading all of this. I know it's long as.

85
00:05:20.640 --> 00:05:22.740
What a good guy, man, what a good guy,

86
00:05:23.430 --> 00:05:26.820
what a good way to come at someone to there's no rules,

87
00:05:26.850 --> 00:05:29.550
but this guy is a sweetheart.

88
00:05:30.090 --> 00:05:34.980
And because of this beautiful letter and because of how selfless you are,

89
00:05:35.940 --> 00:05:40.500
uh, I'm going to make your, your brother,

90
00:05:40.590 --> 00:05:44.880
your hero, your hero brother, uh, an elder.

91
00:05:45.030 --> 00:05:48.870
And um, I'm going to send you one too, dude, because he didn't ask for it. Uh,

92
00:05:49.050 --> 00:05:52.650
so you guys are both elders and you can share that together and thank you for

93
00:05:52.651 --> 00:05:53.460
listening.

94
00:05:53.460 --> 00:05:58.100
Thank you for your service to Justin Day

95
00:05:58.880 --> 00:06:02.510
and Braden day. Thank you for writing me this message. Uh,

96
00:06:02.600 --> 00:06:07.190
and shout out to you and your team out there to, uh,

97
00:06:07.250 --> 00:06:09.740
your spec ops team. That's just the sweetest man.

98
00:06:10.390 --> 00:06:12.160
<v 1>And sorry, you lost your leg a little.</v>

99
00:06:12.160 --> 00:06:15.220
<v 0>Bit of your, or a lot of your leg and your fingers. Uh,</v>

100
00:06:15.730 --> 00:06:17.710
but just remember that

101
00:06:19.630 --> 00:06:23.560
inside the basement in your laundry room,

102
00:06:24.130 --> 00:06:28.510
in your secret department, in your laundry room,

103
00:06:29.380 --> 00:06:33.790
into that candle lit seance that you know,

104
00:06:34.240 --> 00:06:39.070
life reps anyway, uh, I, I love what you do for this country and that's amazing.

105
00:06:39.190 --> 00:06:42.910
And Brayden, it sounds like you're a great family, man. You, you, you guys,

106
00:06:42.911 --> 00:06:45.730
both of you guys, uh, yeah, that's, that's so cool.
