00:00:00.450 --> 00:00:03.150
<v 0>Awesome. Anyway, uh, what's up?</v>

2
00:00:04.830 --> 00:00:08.550
Do you guys have, uh, the coronavirus yet?

3
00:00:08.760 --> 00:00:11.010
Is anybody listening to this that has a Corona virus?

4
00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:14.100
I only fist bump, dude.

5
00:00:14.690 --> 00:00:18.350
<v 1>I fist bump period. But now when somebody wants to shake my hand,</v>

6
00:00:18.620 --> 00:00:21.530
I legitimately want to be like the is your deal.

7
00:00:23.240 --> 00:00:25.100
And not because shaking hands is a bad thing.

8
00:00:25.101 --> 00:00:27.440
I think I'm gonna get the Corona virus if I shake someone's hand.

9
00:00:27.620 --> 00:00:29.390
But I think I might get the coronavirus.

10
00:00:29.420 --> 00:00:33.740
If I shake everybody's hand and guess who's guests is shaking. Everybody's hand.

11
00:00:35.030 --> 00:00:36.200
If I'm out in public,

12
00:00:36.470 --> 00:00:40.040
I'm going to shake everybody's hand because people are saying. Oh, Hey Chris,

13
00:00:40.041 --> 00:00:42.380
I'll hit Chris. It's like a Pete Buddha, JJ, dude,

14
00:00:42.440 --> 00:00:45.680
if I'm out in LA I'm Pete Buddha, judge, you understand

15
00:00:47.210 --> 00:00:48.380
people want to shake your boy's hands.

16
00:00:48.381 --> 00:00:52.080
So I got to do a fist bump and then still people are looking at me like, Whoa,

17
00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:54.920
okay, well, we don't want to shake hands. Yeah, dude.

18
00:00:55.280 --> 00:00:58.850
Cause I got to shake everybody's hand cause I'm not getting the room.

19
00:00:59.060 --> 00:00:59.990
<v 0>Virus, dude,</v>

20
00:01:03.290 --> 00:01:07.370
Corona that's so Dick for the fight, it's so for the beer company.

21
00:01:07.371 --> 00:01:11.510
You know that it's called the Corona virus as I call it the bud light virus.

22
00:01:12.590 --> 00:01:17.000
Like it's just whoever crude coined the term, they just over Corona, the beer,

23
00:01:20.780 --> 00:01:23.390
you know, there's frat guys out there. That's just, uh, that are like, dude,

24
00:01:23.391 --> 00:01:24.110
I've been.

25
00:01:24.110 --> 00:01:25.880
<v 1>It. I I've had the coronavirus for years.</v>

26
00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:28.670
<v 0>Dog just drinking a Corona.</v>

27
00:01:29.180 --> 00:01:31.160
<v 1>You'd take your Colonel bars with wine. It's.</v>

28
00:01:31.160 --> 00:01:32.630
<v 0>Classic there.</v>

29
00:01:32.631 --> 00:01:36.470
Isn't more of a frat guy thing to say then classic when something's not classic.

30
00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:42.350
No doubt, dude. It's classic dude. Coronavirus dude.

31
00:01:42.351 --> 00:01:45.590
I've had the Corona virus for years, dog. Ugh.

32
00:01:47.780 --> 00:01:52.580
Uh, when a white guy cause another white guy dog, you know? Uh, yeah.

33
00:01:52.581 --> 00:01:55.430
So anyway, uh, but do you have the coronavirus if you do,

34
00:01:55.431 --> 00:01:59.480
I really want to hear about it. So just tweet me so I could not look at it.

35
00:01:59.750 --> 00:02:04.280
You know? Uh, it's. I guess the, the kill rate is like two,

36
00:02:04.290 --> 00:02:08.330
3% and the flu is like 0.1 or something.

37
00:02:09.410 --> 00:02:11.630
I think it's not, I think it's worse than the flu. That's what I heard.

38
00:02:11.631 --> 00:02:12.464
This one, my buddy Dan.

39
00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:17.600
<v 1>But you know what dude, I'm done trusting Dan. Yay. Woo.</v>

40
00:02:17.780 --> 00:02:21.680
I'm done trust in Dan. Yes, dude. I won't trust him anymore.

41
00:02:21.950 --> 00:02:26.090
You know why he's a liar and you know why he's a liar. This is the, man.

42
00:02:26.091 --> 00:02:30.110
That is important to me when somebody says.

43
00:02:31.910 --> 00:02:34.730
<v 0>Here's what happened and I put it on my Instagram. It's my last Instagram post.</v>

44
00:02:34.731 --> 00:02:35.720
But if you're listening to this in.

45
00:02:35.720 --> 00:02:38.150
<v 1>A few days, it's probably not my last Instagram post.</v>

46
00:02:38.930 --> 00:02:42.170
<v 0>So go back a few. My buddy,</v>

47
00:02:42.171 --> 00:02:45.260
Dan goes like this,

48
00:02:45.500 --> 00:02:48.770
let me just try to lay it out in the most basic of terms. Okay.

49
00:02:48.800 --> 00:02:52.820
My buddy Dan says for no reason, you know,

50
00:02:52.821 --> 00:02:57.740
it's supposed to rain tomorrow and I go and I say, Oh cool. And then he says,

51
00:02:57.950 --> 00:02:58.783
yup.

52
00:02:59.470 --> 00:03:03.970
And then we just keep drinking coffee because that's all I do is drink coffee

53
00:03:04.120 --> 00:03:06.610
all day long. And when people say, well,

54
00:03:06.611 --> 00:03:08.650
maybe that's why you have restless leg syndrome.

55
00:03:09.040 --> 00:03:13.840
I get off because that's not going to stop. And also that's not why,

56
00:03:14.050 --> 00:03:17.470
because I've done, you know, testing for it.

57
00:03:18.010 --> 00:03:22.550
I've had a control and a, whatever. The other thing,

58
00:03:22.810 --> 00:03:26.980
I don't do science, but I did testing for my resume restless leg syndrome.

59
00:03:29.140 --> 00:03:32.440
You know what helps with restless leg syndrome for real busting a nut

60
00:03:33.760 --> 00:03:35.800
sensation. Anyway.

61
00:03:39.570 --> 00:03:43.110
<v 2>My buddy Dan is a liar. Yay dude.</v>

62
00:03:43.530 --> 00:03:47.730
<v 0>Why man? Because he goes like this, it's going to rain tomorrow. And I said,</v>

63
00:03:47.760 --> 00:03:52.530
Oh yeah. He said, yup. And then we just kept drinking that coffee. All right.

64
00:03:53.340 --> 00:03:56.400
And then he goes and then that's it. And that's it.

65
00:03:56.820 --> 00:04:01.260
Later on in the night we were walking down sunset going to get something to eat

66
00:04:01.261 --> 00:04:02.460
or something. I don't remember.

67
00:04:02.640 --> 00:04:07.350
Maybe we're getting another coffee because I'll get two coffees in a row. Dude.

68
00:04:07.470 --> 00:04:10.350
<v 1>I'll go to one cafe, get a coffee, drink half of it,</v>

69
00:04:10.470 --> 00:04:14.550
bring it to the next spot and then drink another coffee.

70
00:04:18.270 --> 00:04:19.103
<v 2>[Inaudible].</v>

71
00:04:19.170 --> 00:04:21.930
<v 0>Anyway, I don't remember what coffee shop we were at,</v>

72
00:04:21.931 --> 00:04:24.150
but we were walking to another one probably. Okay.

73
00:04:24.360 --> 00:04:29.250
And I zip up my jacket and I say

74
00:04:29.670 --> 00:04:32.940
kind of, I got cold out. Didn't it? And he said,

75
00:04:33.450 --> 00:04:37.260
I told you it was going to get cold. And I go like this.

76
00:04:39.600 --> 00:04:40.980
<v 2>I leaned back like a teacher.</v>

77
00:04:42.210 --> 00:04:45.120
<v 0>But you know, there's something else going on too. Like maybe they cheat it.</v>

78
00:04:46.020 --> 00:04:49.320
That's how I look at him. And I say, Oh yeah.

79
00:04:50.340 --> 00:04:53.080
<v 1>And he says, yeah, I said it. And I said, well.</v>

80
00:04:55.890 --> 00:04:57.360
<v 2>When did you say that?</v>

81
00:04:58.800 --> 00:05:00.030
<v 0>And he said,</v>

82
00:05:01.830 --> 00:05:03.990
I said it was going to rain tomorrow.

83
00:05:11.400 --> 00:05:15.930
<v 1>We broke the microphone on that one, man. That was a mic break.</v>

84
00:05:18.090 --> 00:05:18.660
<v 2>Where did he go?</v>

85
00:05:18.660 --> 00:05:20.940
<v 0>Come from dude. Oh, over here.</v>

86
00:05:22.350 --> 00:05:24.240
Dan made me break my microphone, dude.

87
00:05:28.710 --> 00:05:29.543
<v 2>Dude.</v>

88
00:05:34.230 --> 00:05:37.920
<v 1>Legit. Okay. Now this drives me.</v>

89
00:05:38.460 --> 00:05:40.080
Bananas, dude.

90
00:05:40.950 --> 00:05:43.800
I'm BA and a right now.

91
00:05:45.390 --> 00:05:50.070
And he goes, and I said, Oh well that's different dude.

92
00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:53.820
Well, that's different. And he said,

93
00:05:55.140 --> 00:05:56.310
and he was trying to act like,

94
00:05:56.790 --> 00:05:59.690
because he said was going to rain the next day that it was going to get cold

95
00:05:59.691 --> 00:06:04.550
tonight. And he said, he said it dude. And he said, he said it.

96
00:06:05.420 --> 00:06:06.860
And I got so mad at him. And I said.

97
00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:08.320
<v 0>And we're done, dude, we're done.</v>

98
00:06:08.500 --> 00:06:12.700
You've moved from my like seventh best friend down to my like 36th

99
00:06:13.210 --> 00:06:17.470
best friend and that's enemy territory because I don't even have really 36

100
00:06:17.471 --> 00:06:21.280
friends. I've got like 25 friends. And then, you know,

101
00:06:21.281 --> 00:06:23.110
it's like the Venn diagram where it's like, Oh yeah,

102
00:06:23.111 --> 00:06:26.200
but you're also my enemy in a way. He's in the middle there.

103
00:06:28.360 --> 00:06:33.340
So then I posted up a Instagram video and I explained this

104
00:06:33.970 --> 00:06:37.570
and then he come, he comments the.

105
00:06:39.910 --> 00:06:44.230
This is what he comments. Hey, guess what? This is what he says. First of all,

106
00:06:44.231 --> 00:06:48.910
he says, Hey, people like he's Kevin Hart. Guess what? It's rain last night.

107
00:06:48.940 --> 00:06:52.540
And it dropped 30 degrees and it dropped 20 degrees. Like I said,

108
00:06:52.541 --> 00:06:55.630
it would the first time Chris Lee doesn't remember this because he's perpetually

109
00:06:55.631 --> 00:06:58.370
distracted. Therefore has a memory of a fleet. And here it goes,

110
00:06:58.660 --> 00:07:01.030
excuse me of lying. I will be okay. Yeah.

111
00:07:01.031 --> 00:07:04.450
So he says he's consuming high jokes and. People feel some dents. I get it.

112
00:07:05.440 --> 00:07:08.320
It's actually funny that he says all this and then, um,

113
00:07:11.560 --> 00:07:14.350
and then he right here.

114
00:07:15.290 --> 00:07:17.920
It's some guy says rain can come with a cold front. Mr. Dalea.

115
00:07:17.950 --> 00:07:21.850
Usually I like rants, but this one was dumb and I wrote way to make it serious,

116
00:07:21.851 --> 00:07:24.310
buddy. Also, that's not, he didn't say it was going to rain.

117
00:07:24.311 --> 00:07:28.540
So that's what's up anyway. Then Dan writes. Yeah.

118
00:07:28.541 --> 00:07:30.520
See whoever this Dan guy is remember saying,

119
00:07:30.521 --> 00:07:33.040
it's going to rain and the temperature's going to drop 20 degrees.

120
00:07:33.070 --> 00:07:34.030
Like you're saying too.

121
00:07:34.031 --> 00:07:36.490
But the crystal D'Elia guy doesn't remember the temperature part because he

122
00:07:36.491 --> 00:07:39.490
usually goes only half listening and he gets mad at people later on for making

123
00:07:39.730 --> 00:07:40.563
up. Okay, dude.

124
00:07:40.660 --> 00:07:44.380
<v 1>Fine. Well then why then later on that night, dude,</v>

125
00:07:45.310 --> 00:07:47.830
why later on that night, didn't you bring that up, dude?

126
00:07:48.280 --> 00:07:52.000
Why didn't you bring that up later on that night?

127
00:07:52.450 --> 00:07:55.960
Was I not listening then? Because then I was in full throttle, full throttle,

128
00:07:55.961 --> 00:07:58.600
heated mode. I listened when I'm in full throttle, heated mode.

129
00:08:00.970 --> 00:08:03.130
<v 0>So now who's making up a day later.</v>

130
00:08:03.280 --> 00:08:06.850
<v 1>And I know some of you see here's the deal. This is exactly.</v>

131
00:08:07.170 --> 00:08:11.050
<v 0>The congratulations podcast is about it's about sin to Maine. All right.</v>

132
00:08:11.530 --> 00:08:14.170
And it's about learning these types of things.

133
00:08:14.171 --> 00:08:17.590
Now this is what NPR should be talking about. Why these kinds of things happen.

134
00:08:17.740 --> 00:08:21.310
But instead they're literally talking about like the economy and global issues.

135
00:08:22.090 --> 00:08:25.150
Okay. This is the important.

136
00:08:25.510 --> 00:08:27.370
This is congratulations podcast to a T.

137
00:08:28.480 --> 00:08:30.730
And I don't remember what I was going to say in the beginning of that sentence.

138
00:08:30.940 --> 00:08:33.490
And it doesn't matter. That's also what congratulations. The podcast is to a T,

139
00:08:34.750 --> 00:08:37.810
but I'm, dude. And now he's my 36 friend. And across this,

140
00:08:37.811 --> 00:08:41.710
over into enemy territory. [inaudible]

141
00:08:43.600 --> 00:08:45.130
yeah. Do it. It's just, it's just,

142
00:08:47.320 --> 00:08:49.660
I don't know why that is always driving me and driven me nuts.

143
00:08:49.690 --> 00:08:54.100
Those kinds of things. That's not what you said,

144
00:08:55.740 --> 00:08:58.260
but that's not what you said. I can't believe how many times I've said,

145
00:08:58.261 --> 00:09:01.560
but that's not what you said in my life, dude, I've said,

146
00:09:01.561 --> 00:09:04.260
but that's not what you said more times than Vince Vaughn has said it. Um,

147
00:09:04.290 --> 00:09:08.100
no doubt. Um,

148
00:09:08.790 --> 00:09:11.580
so that's it. We got too many liquids on here. We got to ice Americano.

149
00:09:11.880 --> 00:09:14.910
We've got a 40 ounce of water that shout out to my boy,

150
00:09:15.600 --> 00:09:20.160
Theo Rossy with the company. And then we got a LaCroix and then we got to,

151
00:09:20.850 --> 00:09:23.670
anyway. I said, we have a nicer Americano, but that's too many drinks. My buddy,

152
00:09:23.671 --> 00:09:26.790
I ripped my Irish buddy at drink has so many drinks on them all the time.

153
00:09:27.120 --> 00:09:31.080
He always has a coffee, water and an actual drink, like a,

154
00:09:32.040 --> 00:09:36.720
like a drink, drink with alcohol in it, bro. Figure it out.

155
00:09:36.810 --> 00:09:41.370
It got two hands he'll you Goro. That's a slam.

156
00:09:43.440 --> 00:09:47.460
And that's a slam. Who you girls? Um,

157
00:09:48.480 --> 00:09:51.180
anyway man, my pitcher sweating so hard. It's crazy.

158
00:09:51.181 --> 00:09:53.550
It's like they filmed Jumanji under my armpits.

159
00:09:59.150 --> 00:10:02.120
I cannot believe he did that dude. That was the first, by the way,

160
00:10:02.121 --> 00:10:05.300
that was the first microphone swing away, come back,

161
00:10:05.301 --> 00:10:09.170
boomerang that I've ever done. And he deserved it, dude.

162
00:10:10.160 --> 00:10:11.990
Anyway, don't get the about. Here's the deal?

163
00:10:13.250 --> 00:10:15.410
My buddy's also scared about the coronavirus. He's like,

164
00:10:15.440 --> 00:10:18.320
I always think stuff is not going to hit us and like that.

165
00:10:18.321 --> 00:10:22.490
But the coronavirus is very, very, um, what do you call it?

166
00:10:22.491 --> 00:10:26.990
What's the contagious. And then, and then I was like, Oh yeah. And he said,

167
00:10:27.170 --> 00:10:29.990
cause somebody got it in like Northern California. And they weren't even,

168
00:10:30.440 --> 00:10:32.720
they didn't even go anywhere on an airplane is like, okay.

169
00:10:32.721 --> 00:10:36.290
So it's very catchable then my babies. So anyway, wear those masks.

170
00:10:36.530 --> 00:10:40.370
I can't wait to go to West Palm beach next week, next, uh, um,

171
00:10:41.450 --> 00:10:46.400
month and wear the mask for real and be like one of those Asians,

172
00:10:46.520 --> 00:10:50.540
the Asians been wearing masks, dude, mass doesn't help.

173
00:10:50.541 --> 00:10:51.800
That's what I've been getting rid of says,

174
00:10:51.890 --> 00:10:53.570
and I'm not going to wear the mask and then get the coronavirus.

175
00:10:53.571 --> 00:10:55.280
And then I'm going to get from where matter, I've undertreated.

176
00:10:55.430 --> 00:10:57.050
I'm gonna wear a mask, but I'm not gonna wear that mask.

177
00:10:57.051 --> 00:11:01.490
I'm gonna wear one of those Richard Nixon masks. They're gonna be like,

178
00:11:01.491 --> 00:11:04.850
what is this point break? I'm going to wear a Richard Nixon mask.

179
00:11:04.940 --> 00:11:07.430
And when people go like, sir, why wearing the mask? And I go like this.

180
00:11:11.010 --> 00:11:11.010
<v 2>Sir.</v>

181
00:11:11.010 --> 00:11:13.670
<v 0>Are you here to Rob a bank? No, I just want to get the coronavirus.</v>

182
00:11:17.870 --> 00:11:21.350
And then they say, well, why don't you just work? [inaudible] white, gray,

183
00:11:24.060 --> 00:11:26.690
[inaudible] dental for some. Isn't it funny to go?

184
00:11:26.870 --> 00:11:29.990
What are the agents come over here? And there actually our dentist,

185
00:11:35.480 --> 00:11:37.370
Because I used to want to walk, walk up to those people.

186
00:11:37.371 --> 00:11:39.830
When the current virus wasn't a thing and I wanted to be like,

187
00:11:40.100 --> 00:11:41.540
can you clean my teeth?

188
00:11:42.830 --> 00:11:46.310
I wanted to walk up to those people and just go like this. Ah,

189
00:11:46.340 --> 00:11:49.010
and when they say, what are you doing? And I say, well, what do you mean?

190
00:11:49.011 --> 00:11:49.844
What am I doing?

191
00:11:50.570 --> 00:11:55.300
We're obviously in a dentist's office and do your going to

192
00:11:55.301 --> 00:11:58.810
clean my teeth because of your mask on,

193
00:12:02.250 --> 00:12:04.260
I just want to flip. I want my brain to break.

194
00:12:04.290 --> 00:12:07.740
I'm so close to having my brain just and start doing that.

195
00:12:11.070 --> 00:12:14.520
And I'm going to, and I can't wait, dude. I think once I turned 50, it's on,

196
00:12:15.510 --> 00:12:19.200
I know we got to like, I'm the youngest man alive at this point. But I,

197
00:12:19.290 --> 00:12:22.440
when we get to 50 and when I say we, because I mean,

198
00:12:22.500 --> 00:12:25.800
all y'all are coming with me, dude, when I say we

199
00:12:28.740 --> 00:12:33.120
disposable ear loop, face masks, do the fact that they,

200
00:12:33.130 --> 00:12:38.100
it loops around the ear. It just makes me feel like we're dumb humans. You know,

201
00:12:38.730 --> 00:12:43.110
like the fact that they were like, that's some like literally anybody was

202
00:12:46.170 --> 00:12:48.840
like, we have ears. And they just, the fact I've always thought this,

203
00:12:48.841 --> 00:12:52.680
that they scoop around the ears is just so dumb. You know?

204
00:12:53.460 --> 00:12:57.720
Like they're like, we'll just put it behind the ears classic.

205
00:13:02.090 --> 00:13:04.620
And we have like 3000 people died from the coronavirus.

206
00:13:06.450 --> 00:13:09.450
And if you're one of them while you're not listening. So,

207
00:13:11.970 --> 00:13:12.803
um,

208
00:13:14.670 --> 00:13:17.160
but a guy came up to me and goes like this fist bumps.

209
00:13:17.280 --> 00:13:21.330
He goes to head the fist bump and he goes, Corona, Hey guy,

210
00:13:21.930 --> 00:13:23.970
you don't have to explain why you're being a.

211
00:13:25.500 --> 00:13:30.420
Just be a with me. Corona. Amen.

212
00:13:30.600 --> 00:13:34.560
Corona, Corona. Hi Corona. Nice to meet you.

213
00:13:36.450 --> 00:13:41.250
Um, one time I got introduced himself to me and he goes like this, Hey,

214
00:13:41.460 --> 00:13:44.370
I say, Hey, I'm Chris. And he says seven.

215
00:13:47.130 --> 00:13:48.750
Oh, you're a robot dude. His name was seven.

216
00:13:48.751 --> 00:13:52.500
I remember it was at the diner in Burbank. What the hell was that place called?

217
00:13:52.650 --> 00:13:54.870
His name was seven. I said seven. And he said, yeah.

218
00:13:54.900 --> 00:13:59.850
And then I didn't do any jokes cause he heard them all for sure. That's,

219
00:13:59.880 --> 00:14:00.090
you know,
