You know what I mean? Um,

00:00:18.450 --> 00:00:22.890
so Halloween is coming up and I know we talked about this because we've had

6
00:00:22.891 --> 00:00:26.700
Halloween shows before at the, um, at the congratulations and.

7
00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:30.270
Cause we've been doing this podcast for about three years, but uh,

8
00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:34.680
let's just send out some reminders, man. Hey chicks. And also.

9
00:00:36.990 --> 00:00:38.970
Um, Halloween is one day, not nine days.

10
00:00:39.150 --> 00:00:41.310
So you celebrate on the day and that's it.

11
00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:44.010
You don't celebrate seven weeks early, dude. I mean,

12
00:00:44.011 --> 00:00:47.160
I swear to God people started celebrating an August man.

13
00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:50.430
I was out by the way,

14
00:00:50.431 --> 00:00:54.660
my friends friend had an outfit on. I thought he was dry.

15
00:00:55.200 --> 00:00:58.170
I thought he was dressed for Halloween. And you wasn't. He was just wearing, he,

16
00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:03.030
he was just fashionable. Quote, unquote got mad, got mad. I was like,

17
00:01:03.031 --> 00:01:04.500
it's a little early from the dress of Halloween.

18
00:01:04.501 --> 00:01:08.760
Found out that that's his actual outfit got mad, got mad.

19
00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:10.253
It's all good.

20
00:01:11.190 --> 00:01:14.640
But I got mad where the mostly the regular,

21
00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:19.620
if you want to get crazy and put one scarf on or wear sunglasses

22
00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:22.050
as the sun goes down fine,

23
00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:26.790
but don't get crazy at nighttime. If you're wearing sunglasses, sunglasses,

24
00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:29.820
be blind, be blind.

25
00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:34.020
I make fun of nobody who wears sunglasses at night. Do you know why?

26
00:01:34.080 --> 00:01:37.320
Because it's not fair because they're blind and that's it.

27
00:01:37.321 --> 00:01:39.990
There are no exceptions. If you're wearing sunglasses at night,

28
00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:43.890
you get extra rights. You're blind. Okay.

29
00:01:47.400 --> 00:01:51.060
Um, yeah. So, uh, you know,

30
00:01:51.540 --> 00:01:55.740
it's like Kanye is bringing back the baggy jeans getting all. It's all good man.

31
00:01:56.730 --> 00:02:00.780
Baggy jeans. No, I baggy jeans, man. Remember baggy jeans.

32
00:02:01.290 --> 00:02:02.610
Remember you used to wear baggy jeans.

33
00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:04.530
Remember James VanDerBeek and varsity blues.

34
00:02:04.531 --> 00:02:08.400
When he's leaning up against the wall talking to the chick and then it cuts to

35
00:02:08.401 --> 00:02:10.440
the wide shot and you're like, does he have another,

36
00:02:10.470 --> 00:02:14.460
does he have the rest of Dawson's Creek in his legs? Dude,

37
00:02:15.240 --> 00:02:16.073
James VanDerBeek.

38
00:02:18.090 --> 00:02:18.923
<v 1>No.</v>

39
00:02:19.530 --> 00:02:21.480
<v 0>Have a little bit more tight pants.</v>

40
00:02:22.500 --> 00:02:24.750
I remember I would wear tight shirts and my uncle would be like,

41
00:02:24.751 --> 00:02:27.750
that shirt doesn't fit. And I was like, yeah, it does. Anyway.

42
00:02:28.380 --> 00:02:31.950
That's a regular story. But um, yeah,

43
00:02:31.951 --> 00:02:33.900
so I was just, you know,

44
00:02:35.910 --> 00:02:39.210
fashion is always going to be like, it's, it's like cutting edge until like,

45
00:02:39.211 --> 00:02:41.610
you're like, it's like annoying until it's cutting edge. And then you're like,

46
00:02:41.611 --> 00:02:43.950
okay, cool. But I swear to God, I don't want to die.

47
00:02:44.190 --> 00:02:46.410
I don't want to have to wear baggy jeans again, dude.

48
00:02:49.710 --> 00:02:53.220

165
00:11:16.521 --> 00:11:18.830
And the guy's like, hold on a second. And then he gets on his,

166
00:11:19.460 --> 00:11:21.110
he puts his hands on his knees and you're like, Oh,

167
00:11:21.180 --> 00:11:23.090
you're that idiot meme thing.

168
00:11:24.230 --> 00:11:29.170
Care's the best thing you can do the best actually

169
00:11:29.171 --> 00:11:33.410
you can get on Halloween from your costume. Is this Oh,

170
00:11:34.580 --> 00:11:39.470
bro. That's the worst, best reaction.

171
00:11:39.471 --> 00:11:40.304
Do you understand?

172
00:11:44.900 --> 00:11:49.820
Oh, look, the guy's dressed up as a Freudian slip.

173
00:11:49.880 --> 00:11:54.460
He's on a slip and it says Freud on his chest. Uh, anyway,

174
00:11:55.090 --> 00:11:56.080
let's get drunk.

175
00:12:00.150 --> 00:12:03.390
The meme based Halloween costumes, you know,

176
00:12:06.600 --> 00:12:10.350
the guy dressed up as you know, I had to do it to them guy. Hey guy,

177
00:12:10.410 --> 00:12:14.520
you just looked like a date rapist. Um,

178
00:12:15.600 --> 00:12:20.430
wow dude, I look gray as today. It's all good man. Due to my pasty white.

179
00:12:20.431 --> 00:12:24.990
Yup. Does it matter? Nope. Does life still rip? Eh, yes dude.

180
00:12:26.160 --> 00:12:31.020
Yeah man. Life rips. You know what I'm being for? Halloween pasty.

181
00:12:31.800 --> 00:12:35.700
That's it I'll put on a shirt. Maybe I'll put on some special pants,

182
00:12:35.880 --> 00:12:37.170
but pasty guy.

183
00:12:40.770 --> 00:12:45.150
How about the thing that goes like this on Halloween ever if you're somewhere,

184
00:12:46.920 --> 00:12:51.900
if you're somewhere in Halloween during Halloween the day and you can't

185
00:12:51.901 --> 00:12:52.734
hear this.

186
00:13:05.580 --> 00:13:06.413
<v 1>[Inaudible].</v>

187
00:13:06.750 --> 00:13:11.490
<v 0>You're in a basement far underground or you're in the middle of the</v>

188
00:13:11.970 --> 00:13:16.230
rain forest because every like 19th house

189
00:13:16.650 --> 00:13:20.130
thinks it's like, why is that a thing? That's nothing.

190
00:13:20.340 --> 00:13:23.940
That's not even a noise that is made ever anywhere.

191
00:13:24.120 --> 00:13:27.570
But on Halloween, it's not a ghost.

192
00:13:28.890 --> 00:13:33.030
You hear ghost. If you Google ghost and you here, you, you, you, you put a,

193
00:13:35.470 --> 00:13:39.810
uh, thing on YouTube, the boosts, the ghosts of go, Ooh.

194
00:13:40.530 --> 00:13:44.010
Or if you Google for real ghosts, the best you'll hear is this.

195
00:13:46.320 --> 00:13:50.730
You know what I mean? I love that. When you're watching you're there.

196
00:13:51.690 --> 00:13:53.580
If you're there to speak, speak to us.

197
00:13:54.450 --> 00:13:58.320
If there are say something we're friendly, we come in peace.

198
00:14:01.920 --> 00:14:05.760
<v 1>Cheer that who's, that.</v>

199
00:14:11.880 --> 00:14:15.420
<v 0>I don't know. I got real cold. All of a sudden you feel that cold.</v>

200
00:14:16.170 --> 00:14:19.110
Then it cuts a talking head. And he's just like, I got to tell you, man,

201
00:14:19.111 --> 00:14:21.690
I never felt so cold in my life. It was just like a gust.

202
00:14:21.840 --> 00:14:25.590
It was like all of a sudden I was in the Arctic cuts back. You're there.

203
00:14:27.000 --> 00:14:31.140
Roger, if you're there, say something, give us something,

204
00:14:33.840 --> 00:14:36.720
Oh. It's cold. It got cold. Did you feel that?

205
00:14:38.730 --> 00:14:41.580
And then it'll be like the EKG and the like, play it back and I'll be like,

206
00:14:44.250 --> 00:14:49.170
Oh, did you hear that? Cross? Play it back.

207
00:14:50.130 --> 00:14:52.370
And then he was like, it cuts the target. He's like, he very clear.

208
00:14:52.371 --> 00:14:56.570
He said full grass. He very clearly said far Gras. Cause that's what he ate.

209
00:14:56.571 --> 00:14:59.120
That was his last meal before, uh,

210
00:14:59.750 --> 00:15:02.330
that was his last meal before he was on death row for fraud,

211
00:15:04.160 --> 00:15:07.490
make a noise. It's just a pipe. You know,

212
00:15:07.610 --> 00:15:10.220
it's a pipe clanking it's house noises.

213
00:15:12.710 --> 00:15:13.543
Anyway.

214
00:15:14.020 --> 00:15:16.480
<v 1>Is like what.</v>

215
00:15:17.620 --> 00:15:19.840
<v 0>Decided that was going to be the noise for Halloween.</v>

216
00:15:21.280 --> 00:15:25.540
I'm unplugging all that when I get there. And then there's always that, ah, ha.

217
00:15:25.690 --> 00:15:27.250
<v 1>Uh, ha.</v>

218
00:15:33.280 --> 00:15:36.730
<v 0>Scary. Just a creaky door is WD 40.</v>

219
00:15:38.020 --> 00:15:42.910
I'm walking around with WD 40 on Halloween and my unplugging hand.

220
00:15:44.080 --> 00:15:46.180
And when I get to a place where I hear cricket doors,

221
00:15:46.181 --> 00:15:49.330
I just sprayed in the people's faces and then unplug with the other hand,

222
00:15:49.331 --> 00:15:54.160
I unplugged the, what is that thing even called? Hey,

223
00:15:54.161 --> 00:15:57.070
do you have that thing? You go to the Halloween stores, bro.

224
00:15:57.100 --> 00:16:01.210
There's so much weirdness about Halloween. You know,

225
00:16:01.720 --> 00:16:06.400
like Halloween stores, you can just go to a Halloween store and it like opens in

226
00:16:08.260 --> 00:16:12.700
September and then just closes November 1st.

227
00:16:13.990 --> 00:16:17.170
And there are 45 of them in Burbank, California.

228
00:16:18.520 --> 00:16:22.900
You know, they just opened in September and then,

229
00:16:23.200 --> 00:16:25.210
and then come November 1st,

230
00:16:25.330 --> 00:16:29.830
literally shut the down until next September. Like,

231
00:16:30.100 --> 00:16:30.933
Hey,

232
00:16:33.280 --> 00:16:37.060
how do you stay in business? All good.

233
00:16:37.390 --> 00:16:39.040
How do you stay in bed?

234
00:16:39.041 --> 00:16:43.840
Is what I want to know is how do you sell enough?

235
00:16:44.890 --> 00:16:46.420
which masks and.

236
00:16:47.470 --> 00:16:48.303
<v 1>Machines.</v>

237
00:16:49.630 --> 00:16:54.400
<v 0>From September 20th to October 30th</v>

238
00:16:55.000 --> 00:16:58.150
to stay in business when there's Amazon.

239
00:17:03.130 --> 00:17:05.560
So weird that Halloween stores are a thing.

240
00:17:06.010 --> 00:17:09.100
I would walk by one all the time when I was in NYU. And I would just be like,

241
00:17:09.430 --> 00:17:10.810
how's this thing. Stay in business.

242
00:17:10.990 --> 00:17:15.190
And they'd have the same costumes in the windows in March.

243
00:17:17.500 --> 00:17:21.700
I was like a werewolf. So weird.

244
00:17:23.050 --> 00:17:24.430
Here we go. Add to my baby.
