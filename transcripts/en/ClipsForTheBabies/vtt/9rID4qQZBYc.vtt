00:00:00.510 --> 00:00:04.020
<v 0>I swear. Um, I got to do the episode where I'm just doing ads.</v>

2
00:00:04.050 --> 00:00:08.400
That's going to be that episode's going to rip just to get so respectful on you

3
00:00:08.401 --> 00:00:12.630
guys to just do add 60 minutes straight up of ads.

4
00:00:13.590 --> 00:00:16.020
<v 1>And just in a, in no shirt.</v>

5
00:00:16.230 --> 00:00:19.170
<v 0>Drinking a Virgin, my tie, I don't, you know what that is? I just heard, uh,</v>

6
00:00:19.480 --> 00:00:22.050
heard about them. What's a, uh,

7
00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:25.320
what's the other one where you put the leaves in it. What's that one called?

8
00:00:25.350 --> 00:00:30.270
Is that my tie? What's the one that girls drink. Mohito dude.

9
00:00:30.690 --> 00:00:33.450
Remember when girls figured out that thing, like four years ago,

10
00:00:33.630 --> 00:00:38.190
they were just like, wait, there's the mojitos. And then there,

11
00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:41.140
they went nuts. Wait, this is how you,

12
00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:44.940
you know why it's such a girl drink because you can put so many things in it.

13
00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:49.500
Do you know what girls love things? Girls love things.

14
00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:51.080
They say straight up.

15
00:00:51.200 --> 00:00:55.520
<v 2>You know what guys, guys like, I don't know guys, guys.</v>

16
00:00:55.850 --> 00:00:59.420
<v 0>I dunno, whatever guys, like, guess what guys, like whatever.</v>

17
00:00:59.630 --> 00:01:04.400
This is what girls love things, dude, if you could hold the thing, forget it,

18
00:01:04.430 --> 00:01:05.263
dude.

19
00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:08.930
<v 3>Get it. Chotchkies you should see how many.</v>

20
00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:12.800
<v 0>Times [inaudible] my mom has. How much has chotchkies sounds something like,</v>

21
00:01:12.801 --> 00:01:16.460
it sounds like it's a racist thing. Is it? Probably I have no idea.

22
00:01:16.550 --> 00:01:20.900
I have no idea. All I know are chotchkies are things. And if it's racist,

23
00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:25.580
come get me babies. I've got no clue. Uh,

24
00:01:26.390 --> 00:01:26.621
do it.

25
00:01:26.621 --> 00:01:29.780
My mom's got so many chotchkies and then she's got the nerve when she's done

26
00:01:29.781 --> 00:01:31.550
with the tchotchkes to be like, Hey.

27
00:01:31.850 --> 00:01:35.690
<v 2>Chris, I got some stuff for you. Come put this church key in your house.</v>

28
00:01:38.090 --> 00:01:41.990
<v 0>I got a whole closet full of chotchkies. Cause of my mom. Life's hard.</v>

29
00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:45.620
But what I'm saying is girls love things and that's why my ties kick.

30
00:01:46.750 --> 00:01:49.720
Give a girl. Oh, you don't think girls love things. Dude.

31
00:01:50.260 --> 00:01:54.610
Give your girl a bag full of in it. Give your girl a bag full of it.

32
00:01:55.030 --> 00:01:59.260
things in it. Watch her smile, dude. She'll get chapped lips.

33
00:01:59.261 --> 00:02:01.510
You smile so hard. So smart. So hard. That,

34
00:02:01.511 --> 00:02:04.060
that on the bottom of the middle of her lip just goes.

35
00:02:04.540 --> 00:02:05.740
And then all of a sudden she's like,

36
00:02:05.770 --> 00:02:09.580
I need chapstick and you go check the bag because it's in there because it's a

37
00:02:09.581 --> 00:02:10.414
thing.

38
00:02:13.420 --> 00:02:15.680
<v 2>That's why girls have chapstick. They don't even like it.</v>

39
00:02:15.940 --> 00:02:20.090
I like to always keep my lip. No, no you don't. You like it. Cause it's a thing.

40
00:02:23.090 --> 00:02:26.410
That's what girls say. Let's fix it up. It's an old car.

41
00:02:26.440 --> 00:02:30.580
It's so you get the car and what do we need? The parts and oh, we have good.

42
00:02:30.581 --> 00:02:33.640
We have this stuff. Let's not fix up the car. I just really wanted all the.

43
00:02:37.620 --> 00:02:41.250
<v 0>I'm surprised girls. Aren't hip to those glasses that come up like this yet.</v>

44
00:02:41.880 --> 00:02:44.160
They just like the real big ones. Cause it's more of a thing.

45
00:02:44.370 --> 00:02:47.880
But you mark my words. Girls are going to be wearing those.

46
00:02:48.920 --> 00:02:49.753
<v 1>In.</v>

47
00:02:50.990 --> 00:02:53.390
<v 2>By next summer. I'll ah, you know what? By the end of this summer,</v>

48
00:02:54.190 --> 00:02:54.610
I'm gonna put.

49
00:02:54.610 --> 00:02:56.650
<v 0>It out there. Girls are gonna be wearing those flip-up glasses.</v>

50
00:02:56.651 --> 00:03:00.700
That Corey Haim used to wear. I swear to God, because it's the thing,

51
00:03:00.701 --> 00:03:03.610
because they've got two things now they got this part and this part

52
00:03:07.190 --> 00:03:09.590
it's amazing how much girls love things and they do.

53
00:03:09.710 --> 00:03:13.430
And that's not a sexist thing. It's a gatherer thing. A hunter gatherer thing,

54
00:03:13.460 --> 00:03:16.070
guys go out and get the things and they bring the things to the girl and the

55
00:03:16.370 --> 00:03:17.690
girls put it all in the house.

56
00:03:21.250 --> 00:03:25.180
Wonder what the girl is, who got the first thing was probably some,

57
00:03:26.420 --> 00:03:29.650
uh, uh, a, uh, a big

58
00:03:31.990 --> 00:03:36.640
bunch of tied ups. It's weird.

59
00:03:36.730 --> 00:03:41.560
How that's yeah. A bunch of tied up sticks. And then they were like, oh,

60
00:03:41.561 --> 00:03:45.580
you can burn this. And it makes a cool scent. And the guy was like,

61
00:03:45.670 --> 00:03:47.890
what are you doing with that thing? I, you know,

62
00:03:47.920 --> 00:03:50.230
it's usually for firewood and he's like, no, no. She's like, no,

63
00:03:50.231 --> 00:03:53.230
it's for smelling. And he's like, that's not a football.

64
00:03:53.350 --> 00:03:57.550
We mean like it makes the hut smell. Good. All right.

65
00:04:01.290 --> 00:04:05.770
Okay. Jewelry. There you go. Bam.

66
00:04:06.970 --> 00:04:11.080
What'll guys wear a tie. Or if guys don't want to guys are like,

67
00:04:11.110 --> 00:04:14.140
I don't wanna wear the tie with a tie.

68
00:04:15.760 --> 00:04:19.030
You see a guy who doesn't wear a tie, wear a tie. You see his face, bro.

69
00:04:19.090 --> 00:04:22.480
Have you ever seen a guy's face? Who doesn't usually wear a tie wearing a tie?

70
00:04:23.200 --> 00:04:28.000
It sucks. GOs. Love to get dressed up though. Let's do it.

71
00:04:30.080 --> 00:04:33.980
I mean, not every girl, you know, but I'm saying girls are like, I mean,

So I'm going to make all of my family go to Kalamazoo

83
00:05:19.730 --> 00:05:23.180

That's how much girls, like things they'll make you what a Kalamazoo,

85
00:05:30.221 --> 00:05:31.360

So you got to go and you got to dance the night away. Dude.

89
00:05:42.671 --> 00:05:46.090
But I got there once I got there, it was he ever talked to that guy.

90
00:05:47.530 --> 00:05:52.210
That has to do it. A real man goes like, yo,

91
00:05:52.211 --> 00:05:56.010
did you have fun though? Was it fun? A real man goes like this. Nope.

92
00:05:56.460 --> 00:05:57.800
Didn't to go.

00:05:57.830 --> 00:06:02.450
Was there made the best of it because I'm a human being and didn't want to

94
00:06:03.350 --> 00:06:07.190
have to jump, but it was fine.

95
00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:12.410
Cause I made it fine in my head all from a girl

96
00:06:14.030 --> 00:06:16.100
because she loves things.

97
00:06:16.100 --> 00:06:18.080
<v 0>And you know what makes the world go round things?</v>

98
00:06:23.460 --> 00:06:27.180
Yeah, man, I always thought about how girls,

99
00:06:27.181 --> 00:06:30.060
like things ever since I was a little kid, I would be like,

100
00:06:30.510 --> 00:06:33.270

101
00:06:35.760 --> 00:06:38.640
What a weird kid. I must have been mad for real.
