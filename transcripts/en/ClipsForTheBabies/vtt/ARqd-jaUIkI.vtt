00:00:01.380 --> 00:00:04.170
<v 0>I was on the plane coming back, dude. I was on the plane coming back from, uh,</v>

2
00:00:05.160 --> 00:00:10.050
what do you call it? Where you know what, wherever the I was,

3
00:00:10.450 --> 00:00:13.650
I died Daytona. I was on the plane coming back.

4
00:00:17.040 --> 00:00:17.873
Hey man, look,

5
00:00:18.690 --> 00:00:23.190
if you're a guy or a girl that talks too loud on the plane,

6
00:00:23.670 --> 00:00:27.090
you deserve to not eat for three days or no,

7
00:00:27.091 --> 00:00:31.470
you deserve to not eat the whole day. Three days is a lot, dude,

8
00:00:35.390 --> 00:00:39.290
when you're on the plane, straight up, shut the up,

9
00:00:40.850 --> 00:00:41.720
shut the up.

10
00:00:46.640 --> 00:00:49.580
People are on the plane. Just like, well, you know, I talked to,

11
00:00:49.581 --> 00:00:52.580
I talked to him the other day and he, you know, it's all, uh, you know, he said,

12
00:00:52.581 --> 00:00:57.020
he'd have the reports in and you know, he did it and it's fine, but you know,

13
00:00:57.021 --> 00:01:00.510
we'll get it. And it'll all be fine. But my, my issue is, if he's going,

14
00:01:00.650 --> 00:01:02.930
gonna say, he's going to do something and he doesn't do it.

15
00:01:02.931 --> 00:01:07.280
And everyone in the cabinet is just looking at each other,

16
00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:09.380
like check out this

17
00:01:17.660 --> 00:01:19.820
or, or even worse. It's a woman even worse.

18
00:01:19.821 --> 00:01:24.510
It's a woman because they've got the voice. That's like, yeah, yeah.

19
00:01:24.890 --> 00:01:26.660
You know, when a woman has a

20
00:01:29.300 --> 00:01:29.300
[inaudible], it's like guys for some reason, guys, as annoying as guys will

21
00:01:29.300 --> 00:01:29.300
 just be like this, talking like this. But when women do it, it's just like 

22
00:01:29.300 --> 00:01:30.133
[inaudible].

23
00:01:41.420 --> 00:01:46.040
And you're like, Oh, for sake is a dolphin in three F.

24
00:01:49.490 --> 00:01:52.790
Yeah. So I talked to her and I and yen. Yeah.

25
00:01:55.910 --> 00:01:59.780
I look at him, dude, guy or girl, I straight up look at him. I go like this.

26
00:02:03.290 --> 00:02:03.860
<v 1>Okay.</v>

27
00:02:03.860 --> 00:02:08.030
<v 0>I do you think I'm joking? I look straight up.</v>

28
00:02:09.860 --> 00:02:14.060
I look at them and they're always in like a button down.

29
00:02:14.510 --> 00:02:17.540
If you're a beat, fly comfy.

30
00:02:19.910 --> 00:02:23.270
Who in a suit, you know guys relax, dude.

31
00:02:24.740 --> 00:02:27.920
Yeah. So you know, and this guy was in front of me, dude, first of all,

32
00:02:27.921 --> 00:02:31.910
he was 65. So you know how to live. Right.

33
00:02:32.750 --> 00:02:34.820
You've had 65 years of doing it.

34
00:02:35.570 --> 00:02:38.030
Don't know how to live.

35
00:02:41.630 --> 00:02:44.990
And he's just talking to the flight attendant and the flight attendant is

36
00:02:44.991 --> 00:02:45.830
talking back.

37
00:02:45.831 --> 00:02:50.240
Like he doesn't have 150 cups to fill with ice.

38
00:02:51.980 --> 00:02:56.600
And this guy's just yeah. Cause when I usually fly from, Oh dude,

39
00:02:56.780 --> 00:03:01.000
really? Oh, when you, usually you usually,

40
00:03:05.220 --> 00:03:06.630
When you usually fly,

41
00:03:08.460 --> 00:03:12.180
you know how boring the sentence begins, the boring, how boring,

42
00:03:12.181 --> 00:03:15.750
the sentences that begins with? Well, when I usually fly, Hey,

43
00:03:16.230 --> 00:03:17.820
flying is boring.

44
00:03:19.440 --> 00:03:22.530
That's why most people sleep during it.

45
00:03:26.340 --> 00:03:27.810
Plain talkers dude,

46
00:03:33.150 --> 00:03:36.120
dude. He was doing jokes.

47
00:03:36.810 --> 00:03:41.280
And the flight attendant by the way was like love in it. They were the same age.

48
00:03:41.281 --> 00:03:44.730
So they were like, it just drives me.

49
00:03:44.731 --> 00:03:46.530
And it doesn't even have to be talking to you.

50
00:03:46.531 --> 00:03:50.370
If you're talking loud around as practice,

51
00:03:50.730 --> 00:03:52.800
keep touching your top lip to your bottom lip.

52
00:03:52.830 --> 00:03:57.270
Practice that 30,000 feet in the air only

53
00:03:57.271 --> 00:04:01.950
talk 5,000 feet above sea

54
00:04:01.951 --> 00:04:02.784
level,

55
00:04:04.290 --> 00:04:09.030
5,000 feet above sea level to sea level. That's where talking happens.

56
00:04:10.050 --> 00:04:12.240
If you're above 5,000 feet

57
00:04:13.740 --> 00:04:18.480
zip cake, or if you're on a tube, a long,

58
00:04:18.481 --> 00:04:19.350
big tube,

59
00:04:19.351 --> 00:04:23.700
that's the thing people will get at six o'clock in the morning,

60
00:04:24.690 --> 00:04:28.650
there was another girl I was flying to wherever or,

61
00:04:28.890 --> 00:04:32.520
or no eight Daytona. That's where I was flying to from or from Sacramento.

62
00:04:32.550 --> 00:04:36.350
And she was just like in, in,

63
00:04:36.650 --> 00:04:41.340
in line boarding and I was already sitting down and she was me at map me at map

64
00:04:41.341 --> 00:04:45.300
map. And I looked up, dude,

65
00:04:45.880 --> 00:04:50.190
me ma just loud as.

66
00:04:51.750 --> 00:04:56.040
Just say quieter. We all hear you. If you're like this,

67
00:04:56.670 --> 00:04:58.920
why do you have to meet up puppet dude?

68
00:05:00.390 --> 00:05:05.370
And he was the guy, dude. And the guy was just

69
00:05:06.960 --> 00:05:10.890
cause when I, when this, when I, I, the guy said I more than,

70
00:05:15.170 --> 00:05:18.600
When I, he literally looked at the guy next to him and he said, Hey,

71
00:05:18.601 --> 00:05:20.310
do you know the co pointed to his TV? And he said,

72
00:05:20.490 --> 00:05:24.000
you know the code to get porn on this. Oh Jesus Christ, man.

73
00:05:26.490 --> 00:05:29.850
You know what, dude, you have to fake laugh at it. And that was just the worst.

74
00:05:30.540 --> 00:05:32.370
I'm in the, on behind him. Literally just like this.

75
00:05:33.720 --> 00:05:37.590
I hope he looks back so I could just go, Hey dude,

76
00:05:39.840 --> 00:05:44.570
when was your ninth birthday? Because Oh,

77
00:05:44.580 --> 00:05:49.230
it already happened. Oh, then you know not to do this.

78
00:05:52.050 --> 00:05:56.310
Hey man, what did you just get for your ninth birthday?

79
00:05:58.160 --> 00:06:01.400
What do you mean? What did I just get? I'm 67.

80
00:06:02.090 --> 00:06:04.700
Oh dude. My bad.

81
00:06:05.180 --> 00:06:09.800
I thought you just had your ninth birthday because you're

82
00:06:09.801 --> 00:06:11.510
doing what you're doing.

83
00:06:15.550 --> 00:06:19.630
What kind of cake did you have? That's what, that's what I'm going to ask.

84
00:06:19.780 --> 00:06:23.590
Anytime someone does talk loud, playing, talking from now on.

85
00:06:23.591 --> 00:06:26.470
I'm going to turn to them and I'm going to say, Hey,

86
00:06:28.090 --> 00:06:30.490
what kind of cake did you have?

87
00:06:32.740 --> 00:06:36.970
Or Hey, how was your ninth birthday?

88
00:06:39.580 --> 00:06:43.990
And when they look at me confused, I'm going to say, Oh,

89
00:06:44.740 --> 00:06:45.730
dude, I'm sorry.

90
00:06:45.970 --> 00:06:50.800
I didn't realize you're as old as you are because you're doing what you're

91
00:06:50.890 --> 00:06:55.360
doing my bad.

92
00:06:57.130 --> 00:06:59.200
Imagine if you really did that to someone,

93
00:06:59.470 --> 00:07:02.920
how utterly mind would they be?

94
00:07:04.620 --> 00:07:08.320
They wouldn't get it. First of all, but you would, and then they might get it.

95
00:07:08.321 --> 00:07:10.750
Like they'd be on the rest of the flight. They'd just be like,

96
00:07:11.560 --> 00:07:14.560
I think he was saying that I shouldn't be talking all loud

97
00:07:16.270 --> 00:07:20.530
and maybe I should know that because I'm 65 and it's 6:00 AM and other people

98
00:07:20.531 --> 00:07:25.450
are tired. Oh my God, plain talkers,

99
00:07:25.451 --> 00:07:26.650
go to lunch, dude.
