00:00:00.510 --> 00:00:05.460
<v 0>I love that you listen, man. I make friends, I make friends on set. Do it.</v>

2
00:00:05.490 --> 00:00:06.210
That's what it is.

3
00:00:06.210 --> 00:00:09.120
There's like 10 of us on set doing this movie and I make friends and that's it.

4
00:00:09.121 --> 00:00:11.640
And that's that dude, you got to make friends where you go, right?

5
00:00:12.030 --> 00:00:15.300
You gotta make friends where you go. And I make friends where I go now,

6
00:00:15.330 --> 00:00:19.470
do I always make friends with the most foreign person in the vicinity?

7
00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:24.000
Yes. Do I do that my whole life? Yes. Why do I do that? I don't know.

8
00:00:24.180 --> 00:00:26.460
Do I like people who seem different? Yes.

9
00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:28.920
Was my mom always upset about it when I was growing up in high school,

10
00:00:28.921 --> 00:00:31.800
because you can never be friends with those people's moms because they only

11
00:00:31.801 --> 00:00:33.330
spoke Russian. Yes.

12
00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:37.590
But did that stop me from being friends with IDAs Matin?

13
00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:41.850
Ma I just Mattis and Morgan Ozaki and another guy named I think Robert,

14
00:00:41.851 --> 00:00:43.260
I forget. No it didn't.

15
00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:51.780
Um, so I, you know, I think I just, as a doctor now,

16
00:00:51.781 --> 00:00:56.220
by the way, um, uh, so,

17
00:00:56.850 --> 00:00:58.210
uh, yeah, so I, I,

18
00:00:58.330 --> 00:01:03.150
I made friends with this really famous guy in Germany whose name's Mathias

19
00:01:04.440 --> 00:01:07.680
slows and burger or some never really asked him his last name.

20
00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:09.350
I'm not going to do it though. Dude. I,

21
00:01:09.351 --> 00:01:12.150
why do I need to know somebody's last name? If I stare at them every day,

22
00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:15.870
I'll just call him Mathias, dude. He's the nicest man. I love this guy.

23
00:01:16.650 --> 00:01:21.180
He looks 14 and he's 38 and he's in the movie.

24
00:01:21.480 --> 00:01:21.931
And he said,

25
00:01:21.931 --> 00:01:24.750
literally the cutest thing to me that I've ever heard in my entire life,

26
00:01:25.290 --> 00:01:30.000
in the world, in my entire life. I'm 39, never heard something cuter. He said,

27
00:01:30.150 --> 00:01:34.020
Chris, um, I would love I, um, my English,

28
00:01:34.080 --> 00:01:38.100
I cannot, um, wait, what'd he say perfectly? I want to say it.

29
00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:40.500
I want to say it right. He said, uh, um,

30
00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:46.770
my English is not that good. So when you tell jokes,

31
00:01:46.980 --> 00:01:49.950
I want to joke back with you. Um, but um,

32
00:01:50.400 --> 00:01:55.230
sometimes it takes a little bit of thinking, so I don't know how to say, um,

33
00:01:55.260 --> 00:01:59.970
what I want to say. So hopefully in two, one or two years,

34
00:02:00.750 --> 00:02:05.220
um, I will, my English will be much better and I will be able to joke with you.

35
00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:07.850
Um, I will be able to joke with you then

36
00:02:11.930 --> 00:02:15.800
[inaudible] the most German ever. And it was cute.

37
00:02:15.860 --> 00:02:18.410
And that was when I fell in love with a dude.

38
00:02:19.910 --> 00:02:24.320
Hopefully in two years I will be able to learn more English and then joke. Ah,

39
00:02:27.800 --> 00:02:31.490
he's the nicest man. He's my new best friend. Um,
