00:00:00.060 --> 00:00:04.320
<v 0>Dude got a D in algebra II. Does it matter?</v>

2
00:00:04.350 --> 00:00:07.560
It doesn't matter at all what you get in algebra,

3
00:00:07.590 --> 00:00:10.110
unless you're going to be an algebra trician dude.

4
00:00:12.150 --> 00:00:16.710
One time, one time I was, I was doing algebra in my, in my high school class.

5
00:00:17.280 --> 00:00:19.590
And, and I was like, I'm a mom was like,

6
00:00:19.591 --> 00:00:21.870
you really got to work harder on algebra. It's hard.

7
00:00:21.871 --> 00:00:23.070
I just never made any sense.

8
00:00:23.280 --> 00:00:27.810
I had a teacher named Mrs. Weaver and I was getting a D and we have to make it.

9
00:00:27.870 --> 00:00:32.160
We have to make it. I have, I had to do better and I was trying to do better,

10
00:00:32.161 --> 00:00:32.821
trying to do better.

11
00:00:32.821 --> 00:00:37.410
And then all of a sudden they introduced imaginary numbers and I straight up

12
00:00:37.411 --> 00:00:42.180
said in my head, go yourself, dude. Imaginary numbers. No,

13
00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:45.090
all the imaginary. You got eight apples in the Nate apples,

14
00:00:45.091 --> 00:00:47.490
walk in the door and guess what? There's no apples though.

15
00:00:47.790 --> 00:00:49.560
Did you know that you're making it all up?

16
00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:51.720
These are all problems you're making up. Okay.

17
00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:57.870
You want to know the most Asian thing you can do if you're an American Asian,

18
00:00:57.871 --> 00:01:02.070
is this playing with your pen and doing tricks with your pen like that?

19
00:01:02.400 --> 00:01:03.540
Everyone in lock-in yada,

20
00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:06.960
all the American Asians would do this and they'd catch it.

21
00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:10.500
And I learned how to do that in algebra and I can still do it.

22
00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:13.620
And I'm not even 40. I know, but when I get older, dude, I'm going to,

23
00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:18.090
always be and twirling it like this. Oh, wow. Such a anyway, dude.

24
00:01:19.620 --> 00:01:24.270
Uh, imaginary numbers, bro. No, no, I wish that's the thing.

25
00:01:24.271 --> 00:01:28.650
I wish I was me now back then. And I know people like to think, like,

26
00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:31.560
I know what people like, everyone knows that I wish I knew back then.

27
00:01:31.561 --> 00:01:34.350
What I know now, dude, I don't even care about knowing the.

28
00:01:35.010 --> 00:01:39.720
I wish I was more outspoken because I was that dude back then too,

29
00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:43.140
I had all the opinions, but it just, didn't really revel in it.

30
00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:46.140
I needed to,

31
00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:50.970
I need to be an algebra now as a 17 year old and I need Mrs.

32
00:01:50.971 --> 00:01:54.030
Weaver to be saying, Oh,

33
00:01:54.031 --> 00:01:58.260
so these are we're introducing imaginary numbers. And then I go like this. No,

34
00:01:58.380 --> 00:01:59.490
they're all imaginary.

35
00:01:59.730 --> 00:02:04.440
You making up all these problems by none of this should exist,

36
00:02:04.470 --> 00:02:07.380
dude. And if you listen to this and you're 17, first of all,

37
00:02:07.381 --> 00:02:10.110
turn it off because I'm a bad cause. Bad influence.

38
00:02:11.990 --> 00:02:16.940
But also now algebra sucks, dude.

39
00:02:16.970 --> 00:02:21.260
And I'm almost 40. And I'm telling you that now, you know how they're like,

40
00:02:21.380 --> 00:02:23.480
well, when you get older, you know, you don't do it.

41
00:02:23.870 --> 00:02:26.240
And I'm not a bad influence, dude. this man.

42
00:02:26.390 --> 00:02:30.860
I'm telling you right now you high school kids get out of that algebra class due

43
00:02:30.861 --> 00:02:35.360
to high school is you got to do it because they got to figure out how

44
00:02:35.960 --> 00:02:40.730
to make it. So kids don't stab each other and do heroin.

45
00:02:41.060 --> 00:02:42.830
You understand? That's what high school is.

46
00:02:43.040 --> 00:02:45.560
So all the kids just kind of chill out, hang out,

47
00:02:45.561 --> 00:02:49.820
learn how to be with each other. That's why I call it.

48
00:02:49.821 --> 00:02:53.390
College is too early. Everyone should go to college. When they're 26, 27, 28.

49
00:02:53.690 --> 00:02:58.520
That's when, cause that's the thing it's everyone's you're not done develop.

50
00:02:58.640 --> 00:03:03.070
I'll tell you what I was immature kid

51
00:03:03.310 --> 00:03:06.130
until I was 33 or 34.

52
00:03:06.790 --> 00:03:08.620
I was a late bloomer for real.

53
00:03:08.830 --> 00:03:13.360
I went through puberty a little bit late and I was not an adult until I was 34

54
00:03:13.361 --> 00:03:18.280
35. I did immature with selfish as. That's the thing,

55
00:03:18.281 --> 00:03:21.790
dude, 18. You want me to go to college at 18? That's why?

56
00:03:21.791 --> 00:03:24.640
When everyone goes to 18, it goes to college at 18.

57
00:03:24.970 --> 00:03:27.460
They go absolutely bonkers man.

58
00:03:29.920 --> 00:03:34.900
All of a sudden the dorky kid is the cool kid ever. You know that is,

59
00:03:34.960 --> 00:03:36.280
was like, Hey, you,

60
00:03:36.281 --> 00:03:39.130
you come back for the spring for the summer break or spring break.

61
00:03:39.131 --> 00:03:42.730
And they're like, Hey, we're all going to Robert's house. Robert. Robert who?

62
00:03:42.910 --> 00:03:45.850
Robert. Dolman what? Yeah,

63
00:03:46.750 --> 00:03:51.730
the kid was a dork bro. He runs Pepperdine. What

64
00:03:53.890 --> 00:03:56.770
are you kidding me? Are you kidding? Are you kidding me bro?

65
00:03:56.950 --> 00:04:00.400
I went to visit him in Mizzou. Oh,

66
00:04:01.120 --> 00:04:04.960
that guy runs it. Dude. He's practically Chris Brown at Mizzou.

67
00:04:05.440 --> 00:04:06.273
<v 1>What?</v>

68
00:04:07.390 --> 00:04:11.290
<v 0>He wear the trench coat bro. He doesn't wear that anymore. He's got green hair.</v>

69
00:04:11.590 --> 00:04:14.530
That's not cool. Where do you see him bro? It's pretty popping.

70
00:04:14.710 --> 00:04:17.470
And then he shows up with like some chick named Haley and you're like,

71
00:04:17.710 --> 00:04:22.270
Oh she's from Saint Francis. She's from the other school. God, this guy's in.

72
00:04:22.720 --> 00:04:26.950
And everybody wants to be friends with Rob that's because

73
00:04:27.640 --> 00:04:29.980
we all go to college too or too early.

74
00:04:31.540 --> 00:04:34.030
Rob didn't even figure out who the he was till he went to Mizzou.

75
00:04:35.170 --> 00:04:39.520
And now it's on in pop it in. And by the time that yeah, God people change.

76
00:04:39.550 --> 00:04:42.790
I hated that. I was who I was in high school bro.

77
00:04:44.920 --> 00:04:48.250
And now I am who I am and that not change. And dude,

78
00:04:51.460 --> 00:04:53.800
It's funny, dude. How that happens though?

79
00:04:55.900 --> 00:05:00.640
We all go. We go away. And then we become who we become. That's dude, I,

80
00:05:00.700 --> 00:05:02.860
Oh man. I that bothered me man. When I was a kid,

81
00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:07.750
like people would go study abroad and they'd come back and and they'd be like,

82
00:05:07.751 --> 00:05:12.220
yeah, girls will be like lost my virginity. And dudes would be like,

83
00:05:13.570 --> 00:05:17.080
took a backpack, walked around a little bit, read a book.

84
00:05:17.110 --> 00:05:20.200
Now I know how [inaudible] check in with me.

85
00:05:22.330 --> 00:05:22.510
<v 1>We're.</v>

86
00:05:22.510 --> 00:05:24.520
<v 0>All lost. We're all lost, man.</v>

87
00:05:26.980 --> 00:05:30.820
We go to college too early. That's why now there's people with like, uh,

88
00:05:30.850 --> 00:05:35.710
you know, uh, you see that guy walking a bird flying that guy.

89
00:05:36.340 --> 00:05:38.410
Cause he went to college too early. You saw that guy thing on Twitter.

90
00:05:38.440 --> 00:05:43.180
He was running down the street with two parrots on a leash and the

91
00:05:43.181 --> 00:05:45.880
parents were flying and he was running with those parents.

92
00:05:49.650 --> 00:05:53.340
That guy should get all the

93
00:05:55.140 --> 00:05:57.120
and I'm not joking girls.

94
00:05:57.860 --> 00:06:02.510
That guy deserves all of it for real.

95
00:06:02.990 --> 00:06:05.540
Don't even know what he looks like, but he's gangster.

96
00:06:08.210 --> 00:06:12.830
If I were like, if I was a guy, I gotta walk birds, man.

97
00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:17.750
I gotta walk birds. Do you know how? I didn't know.

98
00:06:17.751 --> 00:06:20.090
You could walk birds. You know what I'm talking about? Right?

99
00:06:20.091 --> 00:06:24.410
You guys have seen this. The birds are flying the guys running.

100
00:06:25.670 --> 00:06:28.850
Kay. I didn't know you could walk birds, bro.

101
00:06:29.810 --> 00:06:34.340
I never even thought of that. This guy is living in 2050.

102
00:06:35.840 --> 00:06:38.030
The birds are level two birds. Are they?

103
00:06:38.690 --> 00:06:41.240
How come we don't talk about how cool birds are man.

104
00:06:41.570 --> 00:06:44.870
But unless you're Brian Callan, we got to all start get, we got us.

105
00:06:45.080 --> 00:06:49.700
That's what that's the thing about high school is that the

106
00:06:49.701 --> 00:06:53.900
classes are all the classes because they need to figure out

107
00:06:54.170 --> 00:06:56.450
the basic,

108
00:06:58.100 --> 00:07:01.790
they need to all conform to all of the certain types of people.

109
00:07:03.050 --> 00:07:07.910
I didn't like that because I'm not doing the that everyone

110
00:07:07.911 --> 00:07:12.500
does. Cause I, you know, Y don't wanna don't wan. Okay.

111
00:07:13.370 --> 00:07:17.510
So that's why if I was you remember electives and, you'd be like,

112
00:07:17.511 --> 00:07:19.700
well I'd like to get into home-ec. I'd like to, even those were.

113
00:07:20.260 --> 00:07:24.200
I'm talking about dude, when I was w w as soon as you get an eighth grade,

114
00:07:24.620 --> 00:07:27.380
I should have been able to sign up for bird walking class

115
00:07:31.840 --> 00:07:34.780
And S and, and there should have been a standup comedy class or whatever the.

116
00:07:35.130 --> 00:07:37.120
And not even a class, it's a stupid class to have, but like,

117
00:07:37.510 --> 00:07:40.480
some kids want to be a magician. I want to be a magician. So now what? Oh,

118
00:07:40.481 --> 00:07:41.950
well there's no magician class. Okay.

119
00:07:42.160 --> 00:07:46.360
So at least let's just have the teachers guide the people and try to learn some

120
00:07:46.361 --> 00:07:47.530
magic to teach to the kids.

121
00:07:52.720 --> 00:07:54.550
That's why I like David Blaine. He doesn't even really do. I mean,

122
00:07:54.551 --> 00:07:55.990
he does magic, but also he'll be like,

123
00:07:56.020 --> 00:08:00.340
I'll just stand in a spot for seven weeks. And you're like, Oh, well,

124
00:08:00.341 --> 00:08:04.120
that's not magic. And he's like, but I'm testing my body. And you're like, okay.

125
00:08:04.390 --> 00:08:06.670
I agree. It tests in your body.

126
00:08:07.480 --> 00:08:12.370
I can just break out of these handcuffs. Really? Yeah. Wow.

127
00:08:12.371 --> 00:08:16.120
That's amazing. It takes eight weeks. Oh,

128
00:08:16.121 --> 00:08:19.000
so you just keep on trying to break them and then finally there's wear and tear

129
00:08:19.001 --> 00:08:23.320
and then open. Yeah. Okay. Is it magic?

130
00:08:23.800 --> 00:08:28.150
I'm testing my body. Okay. But it can do card tricks to my babies.

131
00:08:28.570 --> 00:08:32.080
So som do our car tricks to Al Pachino. And that's a real story.

132
00:08:32.530 --> 00:08:34.540
I live in a fantasy.

133
00:08:35.830 --> 00:08:40.780
I saw David Blaine do a card trick to Al

134
00:08:40.781 --> 00:08:44.740
Pachino and guy Fieri was there and Sylvester,

135
00:08:44.741 --> 00:08:47.860
Stallone was filming it. I live.

136
00:08:48.490 --> 00:08:49.323
<v 1>In a fantasy.</v>

137
00:08:52.180 --> 00:08:53.710
<v 0>And then, and then, and then,</v>

138
00:08:53.830 --> 00:08:57.630
and then did David Blaine say to Al Pachino pick a suit and then did

139
00:08:57.631 --> 00:09:01.710
opportunities say, well, I was an Armani the other day. Ah,

140
00:09:03.270 --> 00:09:07.140
I live in a fantasy I'll Pitino turned to me and he said,

141
00:09:07.500 --> 00:09:11.550
remember that card. I live in a fantasy, Albert, you know,

142
00:09:11.551 --> 00:09:15.900
turned over to me and said, there's my card. Remember it? And then I said,

143
00:09:16.170 --> 00:09:20.400
well, I will, I will actually never forget any of this in my life.

144
00:09:21.920 --> 00:09:26.570
Okay. Was the seven of diamonds. Um,

145
00:09:27.710 --> 00:09:31.010
so, so anyway, uh, that's crazy. So

146
00:09:34.490 --> 00:09:38.030
I, you know, the high school should be more specific. That's why it's specific.

147
00:09:38.600 --> 00:09:40.070
You got to get specific high schools, man.

148
00:09:40.100 --> 00:09:42.410
There should be clumps of high schools that are like,

149
00:09:42.411 --> 00:09:45.080
for certain things like the entertainment high schools that they have some time

150
00:09:45.110 --> 00:09:48.440
to have, like some of them in Texas or some dance, high schools,

151
00:09:48.740 --> 00:09:51.260
they got those weird ones. I used to think those were weird,

152
00:09:51.261 --> 00:09:54.380
but they're probably right. [inaudible]

153
00:09:56.630 --> 00:09:59.390
if you know, you love animals and you want to go to a sanctuary high school,

154
00:09:59.391 --> 00:10:03.860
like an animal sanctuary high school and just chill with zebras and

155
00:10:03.861 --> 00:10:07.370
gophers loved the dude. That would,

156
00:10:07.580 --> 00:10:09.080
I hated that when I was in,

157
00:10:09.200 --> 00:10:12.470
when I was in elementary school and the guy would come with all the animals,

158
00:10:13.520 --> 00:10:16.940
everyone loved it. Well it's animal day. We get to come out.

159
00:10:17.000 --> 00:10:20.690
The guy comes with animals and it'd be like, got class. This is a gopher.

160
00:10:21.470 --> 00:10:24.050
And Steven [inaudible] would be like, Oh,

161
00:10:24.590 --> 00:10:28.460
and there'd be some kid with a closed throat because a gopher came out.

162
00:10:28.760 --> 00:10:31.880
We're like, Oh, sorry. Matthew's allergic.

163
00:10:32.090 --> 00:10:34.940
He's got to go home now in the eighties, nobody gave a.

164
00:10:35.510 --> 00:10:39.050
Now come bring animals. I wonder if they still do that, they probably don't.

165
00:10:39.440 --> 00:10:43.070
They used to bring snakes out, dude. Hey, they could kill us.

166
00:10:45.260 --> 00:10:49.940
Like, why not just bring a wild boar? Oh yeah. It's snake up. There's this up.

167
00:10:50.150 --> 00:10:54.980
This next wallet, Tommy. We didn't like him anyway,

168
00:10:55.550 --> 00:11:00.200
dude. Why not just bring a wild boy, bring a high. They should just bring a,

169
00:11:00.620 --> 00:11:04.310
imagine them bringing just a starving hyena. Hey, class, gather around.

170
00:11:04.430 --> 00:11:09.110
It's just like, this is a hyena. Oh, Whoa. It's thrashing. Oh, Whoa,

171
00:11:09.130 --> 00:11:13.130
Whoa. Okay. It has Danny Vic's arm. Whoa.

172
00:11:13.400 --> 00:11:18.140
It's thrashing Danny Vic's arm hair. You're not swallow mine.

173
00:11:18.590 --> 00:11:23.000
I swallow my arm. Um, anyway.
