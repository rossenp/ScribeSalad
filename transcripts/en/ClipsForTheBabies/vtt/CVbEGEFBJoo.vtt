00:00:00.840 --> 00:00:03.600
<v 0>I actually told this story and I realized I never told this on the, on the,</v>

2
00:00:03.601 --> 00:00:06.270
on the, on the podcast, on this podcast.

3
00:00:06.510 --> 00:00:10.050
But it's funny because I, this was insane.

4
00:00:10.051 --> 00:00:14.640
One time when I was, um, I had to go to the bathroom so bad.

5
00:00:14.641 --> 00:00:18.300
Number two, now, oopsy, Daisy. I was in public, but I don't care, dude.

6
00:00:18.570 --> 00:00:19.403
You know what I do?

7
00:00:19.860 --> 00:00:22.470
Do you know what I do when I got to go to the bathroom in public, number two,

8
00:00:22.471 --> 00:00:24.540
do you know what I do? I go bathroom and public number two,

9
00:00:26.010 --> 00:00:28.590
because that's how it is, dude.

10
00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:34.200
That's how it is. If toilets are around, I'm using them. If I got to go,

11
00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:37.290
I don't people with Oh, germs and like that. That's how you get sick.

12
00:00:38.970 --> 00:00:43.380
And I don't use, I don't use dude. I only use the, the thing.

13
00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:48.330
You know what I mean? The, the cover. I only use that when it's necessary.

14
00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:53.430
Like, if there's some blood on the toilet seat or something, I wipe it off.

15
00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:56.400
I get a lot of toilet paper. I wipe it off.

16
00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:01.110
I wipe it off. So it doesn't touch my hand as well.

17
00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:04.170
And then I put the thing on only if there was like blood or shutter,

18
00:01:05.160 --> 00:01:07.140
but if there's nothing on there and I look at it and you know what I do,

19
00:01:07.141 --> 00:01:09.150
I give it a once over. That's all I do.

20
00:01:09.151 --> 00:01:11.100
I give it a once-over and if it's got nothing on there,

21
00:01:11.101 --> 00:01:15.120
I don't use it because it's just touching my thighs. Dude. If touches your ties,

22
00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:16.860
I don't give a, bro. I'm living.

23
00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:26.750
Oh my God. Chris, you sat on the, you sat on the, on the toilet bowl.

24
00:01:26.751 --> 00:01:31.050
What about getting and all over your balls? Is it on my.

25
00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:34.730
<v 1>Or is it on my thighs?</v>

26
00:01:38.540 --> 00:01:39.260
[inaudible].

27
00:01:39.260 --> 00:01:43.280
<v 0>So I do it and I don't give a dude,</v>

28
00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:46.970
because that's the kind of life you've got to live on gangster.

29
00:01:47.180 --> 00:01:50.210
And if you're out there and if you're going to the bathroom, number two,

30
00:01:50.211 --> 00:01:53.840
and you're not using those safety things, let me know.

31
00:01:55.040 --> 00:01:59.960
And I won't read it, but tweeted at me and I won't read it. Um,

32
00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:05.030
so I don't do as a one time. I'll also, if, if the woman's room is open,

33
00:02:05.510 --> 00:02:09.080
I'm a check. If the man's room,

34
00:02:09.440 --> 00:02:14.240
if the men's room is, uh, is, is,

35
00:02:15.500 --> 00:02:19.830
um, used occupied, and the woman's is not.

36
00:02:23.120 --> 00:02:24.050
<v 1>I'm a check.</v>

37
00:02:25.970 --> 00:02:30.260
<v 0>Apparently I've got to cause I'm in Loudon,</v>

38
00:02:31.790 --> 00:02:33.140
Amman loading in the women's room.

39
00:02:37.730 --> 00:02:40.040
<v 1>Dude. Hey sir.</v>

40
00:02:40.400 --> 00:02:41.233
<v 0>What are you doing?</v>

41
00:02:41.360 --> 00:02:44.600
It looks like you got a penis and you're going in the women's room. Well,

42
00:02:44.601 --> 00:02:45.434
apparently right?

43
00:02:45.590 --> 00:02:49.700
<v 1>No, I'm a female.</v>

44
00:02:55.400 --> 00:02:59.980
<v 0>Oh my God. Are you strangling an alligator? Am I, or am I.</v>

45
00:03:00.640 --> 00:03:01.473
<v 1>Taking a,</v>

46
00:03:05.440 --> 00:03:06.273
bro?

47
00:03:09.630 --> 00:03:13.740
<v 0>So I went into the thing, the ladies room and it wasn't a single stall.</v>

48
00:03:13.800 --> 00:03:14.850
And guess what, dude.

49
00:03:17.430 --> 00:03:21.900
<v 1>You up the way you made this building because this is still.</v>

50
00:03:23.580 --> 00:03:26.430
<v 0>Coming out. All right.</v>

51
00:03:27.720 --> 00:03:31.440
So I go in the woman's room and I tiptoe because now I'm a woman, baby.

52
00:03:32.640 --> 00:03:35.670
And I go in the stall, you know how women always tiptoe.

53
00:03:35.970 --> 00:03:40.740
So I w I go in the stall and I closed the door and then,

54
00:03:41.430 --> 00:03:46.380
uh, and then, uh, and then I closed the door and then, um, I'm going,

55
00:03:46.410 --> 00:03:50.850
right? I'm going, and it's all good, but I'm going, it wasn't an awkward area,

56
00:03:50.851 --> 00:03:54.300
but even still we'd have home with a keyboard. So, um,

57
00:03:54.330 --> 00:03:58.620
so I'm in there and I'm going and a lady comes in and instantly,

58
00:03:58.860 --> 00:04:02.160
I don't know why maybe it's because I'm a. My knees get real close to,

59
00:04:02.460 --> 00:04:05.490
to each other because I'm scared. And I don't want anybody to see my balls.

60
00:04:05.700 --> 00:04:08.460
And I'm trying to be real, real tiny. So nobody could see me,

61
00:04:08.461 --> 00:04:11.190
even though I'm still six, two, and I'm a tall drink of water. Right.

62
00:04:11.191 --> 00:04:13.710
And my shoulders of course are, they go on for like,

63
00:04:13.711 --> 00:04:15.630
do you want to know what the weather is like on Thursday?

64
00:04:15.900 --> 00:04:17.880
Because my shoulders go into next.

65
00:04:18.780 --> 00:04:19.613
<v 1>Weak.</v>

66
00:04:23.280 --> 00:04:24.113
<v 0>You know what I mean?</v>

67
00:04:24.540 --> 00:04:29.080
You want to know what the weather's like on next Thursday while.

68
00:04:29.580 --> 00:04:32.820
<v 1>Let's take a ride on my shoulders,</v>

69
00:04:39.240 --> 00:04:40.830
shoulders go on for a week.

70
00:04:40.831 --> 00:04:45.360
So let me know where you are and I'll tell you the forecast.

71
00:04:45.600 --> 00:04:49.110
Ah, ah, all right.

72
00:04:50.760 --> 00:04:54.630
So are those your shoulders?

73
00:04:54.990 --> 00:04:59.010
Yes. And it's raining on Friday.

74
00:05:01.410 --> 00:05:05.910
<v 0>Anyway, dude, I went in there and my knees were touching together.</v>

75
00:05:06.870 --> 00:05:07.703
Cause I scared.

76
00:05:07.860 --> 00:05:12.210
Cause the lady came in and she was tiptoeing because she's a lady and ladies

77
00:05:12.211 --> 00:05:15.960
always tiptoe ladies have never not tiptoed. And

78
00:05:17.760 --> 00:05:18.511
I'm trying to be quiet.

79
00:05:18.511 --> 00:05:21.630
I'm trying not to let her come out or anything like that. You know what I mean?

80
00:05:22.470 --> 00:05:26.130
I'm trying not to strangle any alligators and she's like, she says,

81
00:05:27.960 --> 00:05:30.540
did a guy come in here? Did anyone see it? No. She said,

82
00:05:30.541 --> 00:05:32.010
did anyone see a guy come in here?

83
00:05:33.120 --> 00:05:37.860
And there's the sliver of the V the way they make these

84
00:05:37.861 --> 00:05:38.850
stalls dude, maybe.

85
00:05:39.440 --> 00:05:41.340
<v 1>So there's no way to peek in.</v>

86
00:05:42.630 --> 00:05:46.680
<v 0>You know, there's always like a gap that's like two inches wide.</v>

87
00:05:47.220 --> 00:05:51.180
And you could just literally make eye contact with people while you're dropping

88
00:05:51.181 --> 00:05:53.040
off. You know what I mean?

89
00:05:54.450 --> 00:05:59.120
<v 1>So, so.</v>

90
00:05:59.180 --> 00:06:00.770
<v 0>She looks at me</v>

91
00:06:04.090 --> 00:06:06.760
after she said, Oh, she says, does anyone see a guy come in here?

92
00:06:07.120 --> 00:06:11.080
And I go like this, I go like this.

93
00:06:12.130 --> 00:06:16.210
I'm like, should I make my voice? Like a woman? Like, should I literally go? No,

94
00:06:16.690 --> 00:06:19.060
but I'm like, no, I'm not going to pass for that.

95
00:06:19.930 --> 00:06:20.763
<v 1>Right.</v>

96
00:06:21.340 --> 00:06:25.690
<v 0>If it were nowadays, I would have just been like, no, and I know you've got,</v>

97
00:06:25.870 --> 00:06:28.810
you hear my voice, but I identify as a woman. I would have done that now,

98
00:06:28.840 --> 00:06:31.990
but this was a while ago. So I just, I was like, should I go? No.

99
00:06:32.110 --> 00:06:35.680
And I was like, nah, for sake. You know, at one time when I was a kid, once I,

100
00:06:35.800 --> 00:06:37.900
when I was a kid, I didn't want to talk to him. Uh, it was,

101
00:06:37.960 --> 00:06:38.561
I was in high school.

102
00:06:38.561 --> 00:06:41.380
I was in eighth grade and this kid was asking me if I wanted to hang out and I

103
00:06:41.381 --> 00:06:42.490
didn't want to hang out and have my number.

104
00:06:42.610 --> 00:06:46.090
Cause nobody had cell phones back then. And they called me and he was like, hi,

105
00:06:46.720 --> 00:06:50.770
uh, uh, I picked up the phone and I was like, hello? And he was like, Chris.

106
00:06:50.800 --> 00:06:53.830
And I was like, he's going to ask to hang out. And I said, Oh no,

107
00:06:53.831 --> 00:06:57.430
this is Chris's mom, Allie. And he was like, Oh,

108
00:06:59.230 --> 00:07:03.070
is Chris there? And I said, and I literally, I literally said,

109
00:07:03.820 --> 00:07:08.560
I L this is the truth. I swear to God. I literally said, Oh no,

110
00:07:08.561 --> 00:07:09.394
he's at the.

111
00:07:09.730 --> 00:07:11.560
<v 1>Opera. Ha.</v>

112
00:07:12.970 --> 00:07:15.880
<v 0>He said, okay, well tell him to call me back. It's David or whoever. Well,</v>

113
00:07:15.881 --> 00:07:20.590
I don't remember who it was. And I said, okay, click. And I remember thinking,

114
00:07:20.591 --> 00:07:20.711
well,

115
00:07:20.711 --> 00:07:24.910
he'll believe that because why the would I pretend I was my mom and say Chris

116
00:07:24.911 --> 00:07:29.860
was at the opera because what the? There's not operas that go on at, well,

117
00:07:29.861 --> 00:07:32.620
maybe they do. I don't know, but not, not in lock-in Jada at 5:00 PM.

118
00:07:35.080 --> 00:07:39.430
So anyway, I, uh, I didn't do that voice. I just, I said,

119
00:07:40.600 --> 00:07:44.980
she said, did anyone see a guy come in here? And I said, no. And I, as I say,

120
00:07:44.981 --> 00:07:49.900
no, I look at out the crack of the doors and I'm making eye

121
00:07:49.901 --> 00:07:51.160
contact with her with one.

122
00:07:51.160 --> 00:07:53.440
<v 1>Eye. And I'm.</v>

123
00:07:53.440 --> 00:07:55.750
<v 0>Looking at her and I say no. And she just said,</v>

124
00:07:55.751 --> 00:07:58.330
did anyone see a guy come in here? And I say, no,

125
00:07:58.720 --> 00:08:01.690
and I am a guy.

126
00:08:03.700 --> 00:08:04.540
Oh, what?

127
00:08:06.040 --> 00:08:06.910
<v 1>And then.</v>

128
00:08:09.220 --> 00:08:13.000
<v 0>Oh, no, I didn't say no. I said what? I said, what? Which is even better.</v>

129
00:08:13.001 --> 00:08:15.490
That's so much of a. I was, she said, I want to see a guy come in here.

130
00:08:15.491 --> 00:08:18.040
And I said, what? And I'm looking at her.

131
00:08:22.010 --> 00:08:23.380
<v 1>And she says, uh.</v>

132
00:08:24.350 --> 00:08:27.430
<v 0>And I S and then she says again, and I swear to God,</v>

133
00:08:27.431 --> 00:08:31.060
this was the only time that's ever happened in my entire life. She said, I said,

134
00:08:31.270 --> 00:08:36.040
did anyone see an iPhone in here? I heard the wrong thing. Cause I was scared.

135
00:08:36.070 --> 00:08:39.700
I'm a. That was the first. That was the only time that ever happened to me.

136
00:08:40.030 --> 00:08:42.340
It was like, that happens in movies. And you're like, Oh, get, go, yourself.

137
00:08:42.341 --> 00:08:46.720
Dude, go yourself. You know? But it really happened. And I said,

138
00:08:46.840 --> 00:08:50.590
Oh no, no iPhone. And she just walked out tiptoeing like a lady.

139
00:08:51.730 --> 00:08:56.520
And I finished up strangling my alligator. And then I walked a man.

140
00:08:59.740 --> 00:09:02.780
It was up that day, dude. Did you know that? So

141
00:09:07.000 --> 00:09:07.833
It was good man.

142
00:09:08.390 --> 00:09:12.950
One time my friend said he was in a foreign country with his brother and he was

143
00:09:12.980 --> 00:09:17.790
drinking with his brother and he and his brother confined

144
00:09:18.020 --> 00:09:18.853
abroad for a little bit.

145
00:09:19.220 --> 00:09:24.170
And he was outside and there was a huge pile of throw up

146
00:09:24.560 --> 00:09:29.420
on the ground. And he was leaning up against the wall. And my buddy said, Hey,

147
00:09:29.421 --> 00:09:32.270
did you just throw up? And he said, I don't know.

148
00:09:35.990 --> 00:09:40.580
<v 1>Uh, caught red handed. I don't know,</v>

149
00:09:41.780 --> 00:09:42.613
hit.

150
00:09:43.130 --> 00:09:47.120
<v 0>I don't know, dude, not straight up lie. No,</v>

151
00:09:47.420 --> 00:09:51.530
I don't know is the best to say, I don't know

152
00:09:53.450 --> 00:09:57.650
when you know, and you're trying to get out of not being a,

153
00:09:58.400 --> 00:10:01.670
you know, in trouble or whatever you think is the best. I don't know.

154
00:10:05.110 --> 00:10:05.943
<v 1>I don't know.</v>

155
00:10:07.250 --> 00:10:09.620
<v 0>That's my favorite kind of. And that's final.</v>

156
00:10:09.890 --> 00:10:13.580

158
00:10:17.871 --> 00:10:22.760
We know what daddy likes that he likes when guys are some

159
00:10:23.810 --> 00:10:26.180

If a guy's wearing sunglasses at night and bumps into a thing,

161
00:10:30.890 --> 00:10:34.910
