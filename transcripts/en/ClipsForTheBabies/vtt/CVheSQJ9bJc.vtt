00:00:01.290 --> 00:00:03.690
<v 0>LaVar ball got banned from ESPN,</v>

2
00:00:03.750 --> 00:00:06.840
which is hilarious when ESPN vans anybody.

3
00:00:06.841 --> 00:00:09.180
Cause like no one gives a about ESPN anymore.

4
00:00:09.181 --> 00:00:12.090
They just watch your on the internet. Um,

5
00:00:14.130 --> 00:00:17.610
I mean, it's like what, five years till ESPN isn't a network anymore

6
00:00:19.110 --> 00:00:22.410
because of like Barstool sports and uh,

7
00:00:23.340 --> 00:00:26.430
house of highlights. Um,

8
00:00:27.090 --> 00:00:29.610
but LaVar ball was banned from being, uh, from,

9
00:00:29.670 --> 00:00:33.960
I apparently making a sexual innuendo to, uh, uh, a female reporter,

10
00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:38.670
which straight up who cares. But, um,

11
00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:42.690
it was really funny because I actually didn't know this,

12
00:00:42.691 --> 00:00:45.870
but I Googled it a little bit, but cause she said let's switch gears.

13
00:00:45.871 --> 00:00:48.990
And you said, Oh, I switched gears with you anytime. And I was like, who cares?

14
00:00:49.470 --> 00:00:51.510
And then I Googled what I was like, am I missing?

15
00:00:51.511 --> 00:00:54.870
So like a Google was switched gears means apparently that means going from like

16
00:00:54.900 --> 00:00:58.260
having sex with a vaginal intercourse and then going to anal,

17
00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:02.580
which I think is a stretch. But whatever. I mean,

18
00:01:02.581 --> 00:01:04.260
I would absolutely say something like, well,

19
00:01:04.261 --> 00:01:06.660
I'd switch gears with you anytime and not know that,

20
00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:10.950
but they banned him from any ESPN thing, which is hilarious.

21
00:01:11.190 --> 00:01:15.900
Cause like who gives a about ESPN straight up? Um.

22
00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:18.690
<v 1>ESPN.</v>

23
00:01:18.690 --> 00:01:22.920
<v 0>Is, is something that's like on, in the background. Like that's what ESPN is.</v>

24
00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:28.110
Imagine working for a company where you just are elevator

25
00:01:28.111 --> 00:01:28.950
music, dude.

26
00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:33.150
Like even people who watch sports are like watching it on their phone,

27
00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:38.220
on like house of highlights or analysis,

28
00:01:38.221 --> 00:01:42.030
you know, like they're doctors.

29
00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:48.030
Uh, so I don't, I, Hey ESPN, can you ban me too?

30
00:01:49.350 --> 00:01:51.660
Just asking? Um,

31
00:01:59.930 --> 00:02:00.321
Uh, I dunno.

32
00:02:00.321 --> 00:02:04.580
I feel like just her like being like awkward and like annoying about that and

33
00:02:04.581 --> 00:02:07.040
about like making a stink about it. I don't know if she did or not,

34
00:02:07.041 --> 00:02:10.820
but like that kind of like pushed the movement back a little bit. Like just,

35
00:02:11.720 --> 00:02:14.450
I would say that to a guy and make a joke.

36
00:02:15.710 --> 00:02:16.790
It's LaVar ball.

37
00:02:18.650 --> 00:02:19.483
<v 1>You know.</v>

38
00:02:19.880 --> 00:02:23.240
<v 0>You're not interviewing Elon Musk. It's LaVar ball.</v>

39
00:02:23.270 --> 00:02:28.160
You put him on your station to get views because he says dumb.

40
00:02:29.030 --> 00:02:30.980
And now you're going to ban him for saying dumb.

41
00:02:33.200 --> 00:02:34.880
<v 1>What the is wrong with you?</v>

42
00:02:36.410 --> 00:02:39.740
<v 0>Add a touch ESPN, outta here with your stupid.</v>

43
00:02:48.380 --> 00:02:53.120
Yes. That's what ESPN stand for. Stands for. [inaudible] pointless news.

44
00:02:57.440 --> 00:03:01.330
ESPN says for sir pointless news.

45
00:03:09.510 --> 00:03:14.430
Uh, please. Nobody that nobody's w nobody gives a.

46
00:03:15.690 --> 00:03:18.930
The only guy they got that's worth watching is that guy looks like ludicrous.

47
00:03:19.110 --> 00:03:23.100
His uncle ludicrous, his cousin.

48
00:03:23.190 --> 00:03:25.110
What's that guy that they gave 10 million to.

49
00:03:25.830 --> 00:03:30.000
They should be giving the stars of a network more than

50
00:03:30.001 --> 00:03:34.290
$10 million, dude. That's how bad he SPN is.

51
00:03:35.190 --> 00:03:37.110
They gave the guy a contract.

52
00:03:37.111 --> 00:03:41.520
Who's that guy that looks like ludicrous is a brother with

53
00:03:41.521 --> 00:03:44.160
diabetes, dude. They, they,

54
00:03:44.161 --> 00:03:46.530
they should be giving him

55
00:03:49.110 --> 00:03:52.650
$80 million. This is a network.

56
00:03:52.860 --> 00:03:57.090
This is their highest paid guy, $10 million.

57
00:04:00.420 --> 00:04:01.253
Steven, a Smith.

58
00:04:02.040 --> 00:04:06.480
He's the only guy that's worth watching all those other

59
00:04:07.620 --> 00:04:11.070
CUCs. I look, I don't watch the ESPN, so I don't know,

60
00:04:11.190 --> 00:04:13.260
but it's always just some guy, you know,

61
00:04:13.500 --> 00:04:17.370
maybe do they even have guys like Charles Barkley and Shaquille O'Neal or is it

62
00:04:17.430 --> 00:04:19.290
like, it's like, this is the guy.

63
00:04:19.440 --> 00:04:19.440
<v 1>Yeah.</v>
