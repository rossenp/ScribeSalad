He's so funny because he makes such a choice and commits to it. Yeah. Yeah.

3
00:00:07.080 --> 00:00:09.000
There was one. I'm never going to remember this,

4
00:00:09.001 --> 00:00:11.820
but he did the Jim Carrey thing.

5
00:00:11.821 --> 00:00:14.760
I watched the clip of him doing the do not go in there. Oh yeah.

6
00:00:14.761 --> 00:00:19.470
And I was thinking about like on a page that is just not funny at

00:00:36.770 --> 00:00:40.670
And it's funny. I it's so hard

12
00:00:42.560 --> 00:00:47.480
to do that. It's so hard to commit that much and still be funny. Yeah.

13
00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:50.720
I think we talked about your career the last time. Oh, we did. We did.

Okay. Cuffs, starring Christian Slater.

66
00:04:05.200 --> 00:04:06.370
I think of that movie a lot,

67
00:04:06.371 --> 00:04:10.480
because there's a play on words that he says in that movie. And it's, you know,

68
00:04:10.481 --> 00:04:15.310
that expression things to people to see things, to do people,

Rick is your face and the original office.

00:06:47.880 --> 00:06:52.660
<v 1>Wow. Oh boy. Oh boy. Oh boy. Away away. When I saw that,</v>

104
00:06:52.661 --> 00:06:55.760
I got to see it. When I saw this, this.

105
00:06:56.050 --> 00:06:57.640
<v 0>You would die at that. You must've.</v>

106
00:06:58.510 --> 00:07:02.350
<v 1>Almost died. This was a choice.</v>

107
00:07:02.560 --> 00:07:03.430
<v 0>First of all,</v>

108
00:07:04.420 --> 00:07:08.170
the fact that the clip is 11 seconds is just that thought. Yeah,

109
00:07:08.980 --> 00:07:13.240
this is the choice. I'm going to make the

110
00:07:17.230 --> 00:07:21.730
Boulder balls. You have to have, those are Mondo. Not the star, by the way.

111
00:07:22.120 --> 00:07:25.960
He's the guy in it, right? Yeah. I mean,

112
00:07:25.961 --> 00:07:28.900
imagine being the director being like, you don't know what he's going to do.

113
00:07:29.110 --> 00:07:33.250
Yeah. And you'd have to take the rest of the day off because you're like,

114
00:07:33.251 --> 00:07:37.870
my movie's going to be a masterpiece now. Unbelievable. So,

115
00:07:38.680 --> 00:07:40.930
um, all right, so I'm gonna play it again. And then,

116
00:07:40.931 --> 00:07:44.650
and then for the fact that it's to make it funny should thank her.

117
00:07:45.310 --> 00:07:46.420
That's your banker.

118
00:07:52.660 --> 00:07:56.410
Oh dude. That is a genius thing to do. I mean, he keeps his arms up.

119
00:07:56.440 --> 00:08:00.790
Why is this? Why do his arms go up? Why do his arms go up?

120
00:08:04.810 --> 00:08:07.840
<v 1>Wow. That's actually.</v>

121
00:08:08.490 --> 00:08:11.650
<v 0>Funny. I can't even laugh at it. I know I am. You're a genius.</v>

122
00:08:11.680 --> 00:08:15.250
I feel like if Jim Carrey saw that, he'd be like, Oh wow, that's great. Yeah,

123
00:08:15.280 --> 00:08:18.400
for sure. Yeah. We should show him.

124
00:08:23.080 --> 00:08:26.890
<v 1>Almost knocked into the other guy to mad. Was the other actor. I know, I know.</v>

125
00:08:28.150 --> 00:08:30.760
<v 0>This is going to be my, yeah. I thought it was really my scene. You know?</v>

126
00:08:31.210 --> 00:08:35.800
That was your banker. Chris gin. Slater's Hey, I know, dude.
