<v 0>Get it. Uh, so yeah,</v>

2
00:00:06.470 --> 00:00:09.590
God, that pizza gate thing is so funny. My, my Netflix specials out,

3
00:00:09.591 --> 00:00:12.890
everybody go check it out. Uh, watch this special, our watch this, uh,

4
00:00:12.920 --> 00:00:15.770
speaking of Netflix, I watched this show, uh,

5
00:00:17.360 --> 00:00:20.870
because I was watching breaking bad and just needed a break. You know,

6
00:00:22.610 --> 00:00:27.260
me and wife watch him breaking bad. I needed a break because it's too,

7
00:00:28.370 --> 00:00:32.570
it's just too intense. And we were like, let's retire,

8
00:00:32.990 --> 00:00:37.940
breaking bad. And let's watch doomsday preppers. Now she wanted to go to sleep.

9
00:00:37.970 --> 00:00:39.260
It me off. All good.

10
00:00:39.261 --> 00:00:42.650
I want it to stay awake and watch doomsday preppers to kind of cancel out the

11
00:00:42.651 --> 00:00:46.850
breaking bad. Now, does it me off? Yes. Is it okay? Sure. It's fine.

12
00:00:48.830 --> 00:00:52.820
Somebody has got to get up at 6:00 AM and feed my baby,

13
00:00:54.440 --> 00:00:57.860
but I watched doomsday preppers and uh,

14
00:00:57.890 --> 00:01:01.070
these people are like the people that think that pizza gate is real.

15
00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:05.480
I watched two episodes because that's how I do when some on Netflix,

16
00:01:05.510 --> 00:01:06.890
sometimes I'll watch two episodes.

17
00:01:07.040 --> 00:01:09.950
I don't watch three or four unless it's like some real hot,

18
00:01:10.550 --> 00:01:13.640
but sometimes I like to test out. I like to dip my toes in the Netflix water.

19
00:01:13.670 --> 00:01:15.140
You know what I mean? I like to do that.

20
00:01:15.141 --> 00:01:16.940
If something's called doomsday preppers, you've got them, right.

21
00:01:16.941 --> 00:01:19.160
I'm not gonna watch the whole thing, but I'm going to dip my toe in it.

22
00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:23.180
<v 1>Because I'm a curious George. Okay.</v>

23
00:01:24.530 --> 00:01:29.090
<v 0>And if you have a problem with that, then get to step in. Um,</v>

24
00:01:29.480 --> 00:01:33.650
these people are nuts though. How about that? It's actually a really good,

25
00:01:33.651 --> 00:01:36.020
well put together show. Um,

26
00:01:36.350 --> 00:01:40.610

27
00:01:43.130 --> 00:01:45.620
these guys talk about the world.

28
00:01:45.650 --> 00:01:50.090
Like they're scared of like either terrorist attacks, uh,

29
00:01:50.091 --> 00:01:54.890
one guy's in a mobile home and he just drives everywhere and he

30
00:01:54.891 --> 00:01:58.850
drives everywhere and he's got like satellite hooked up, but he could,

31
00:01:58.940 --> 00:02:02.060
he blogs from a. I forget what his name is, but he's online and.

32
00:02:02.870 --> 00:02:06.230
He's got a podcast that he does from his mobile home and he just keeps driving

33
00:02:06.231 --> 00:02:09.410
dude. And he's got like a crossbow in guns just in case.

34
00:02:09.620 --> 00:02:13.850
And he sets up the security cameras so he can see heat, heat coming to it.

35
00:02:14.030 --> 00:02:16.780
It's like, and he's just like, look, man, if a terrorist attack Cummins,

36
00:02:16.781 --> 00:02:20.180
I'm going to be on. I'm going to be on the road.

37
00:02:20.181 --> 00:02:23.300
I'm I'm going to drive to where it's safe. And they're like, well,

38
00:02:23.301 --> 00:02:24.710
what about gas? And he's like, well,

39
00:02:24.711 --> 00:02:26.390

00:02:39.140 --> 00:02:42.890
He makes everything and it's just so insane. And I'm just like, dude,

45
00:02:47.210 --> 00:02:51.350
Not sure if something's going to happen in the meantime,

<v 0>Yeah. Do you guys enjoy your quarantine to Easter? Did you do that?</v>

59
00:03:51.600 --> 00:03:55.110
Another guy was on duty. Another guy was on doomsday, preppers and he was, uh,

60
00:03:55.320 --> 00:03:56.160
underground.

61

64
00:04:05.791 --> 00:04:09.300
what was the other guy? There was another guy that was, oh, he was just,

65
00:04:09.301 --> 00:04:10.350
he had a self-sustainable.

66
00:04:11.400 --> 00:04:14.490
<v 2>He's like I don't have any more cash. He's like, I don't have money. I barely,</v>

67
00:04:14.491 --> 00:04:17.250
I don't have any bills though. The only thing I have bills on is his cell.

68
00:04:17.250 --> 00:04:19.560
<v 0>Phone and I have enough money to cover my cell phone for a few years.</v>

69
00:04:19.561 --> 00:04:21.060
And he was like, and I don't even need to, you know,

70
00:04:21.150 --> 00:04:23.250
if a cell phone who cares if I have a cell phone tonight and his wife was like,

71
00:04:23.251 --> 00:04:26.550
yeah, let's go practice shooting things in the yard. And he was like, okay.

72
00:04:26.580 --> 00:04:27.413
And they get, he got.

73
00:04:27.900 --> 00:04:30.570
<v 2>The only time they ever gonna use it is during this show doomsday preppers.</v>

74
00:04:30.600 --> 00:04:32.520
Also, he was like, that's the thing.

75
00:04:32.521 --> 00:04:35.490
If invaders come to find my place because my place is really good,

76
00:04:35.610 --> 00:04:37.920
then I could ward them off with these guns.

77
00:04:38.100 --> 00:04:43.050
And we've got places in my yard that we have coolers of of food

78
00:04:43.051 --> 00:04:46.230
and bullets and guns and sniper rifles. And he was like, so we're good.

79
00:04:46.231 --> 00:04:48.870
And I'm like, but what about the show?

80
00:04:49.470 --> 00:04:52.650
But what about how everyone's going to see where you live now?

81
00:04:52.770 --> 00:04:56.610
Because it's on Netflix and everybody's watching Netflix.

82
00:04:56.610 --> 00:04:59.160
<v 0>Watch my special it's streaming now, no pain.</v>

83
00:05:00.810 --> 00:05:03.090
<v 2>But yeah, that's like that whole thing when it was when it's like.</v>

84
00:05:03.330 --> 00:05:07.350
<v 0>When it's like, when they show like the movies or not the movies, sorry,</v>

85
00:05:07.351 --> 00:05:10.410
the docu-series is where it's like about gang life.

86
00:05:10.440 --> 00:05:13.410
<v 2>Real deal or whatever. They, all the titles are the same.</v>

87
00:05:13.620 --> 00:05:17.730
It's like gang life blood for glory, gang life,

88
00:05:17.970 --> 00:05:22.920
real deal streets, the streets of LA gang life bloods versus Crips,

89
00:05:22.950 --> 00:05:27.810
the lifestyle, blood, blood, blood in blood out gang left gang,

90
00:05:27.811 --> 00:05:32.100
gang, gang, and gang. And with the gang or sins, you know,

91
00:05:33.400 --> 00:05:38.310
it's all named the same. And uh,

92
00:05:38.400 --> 00:05:41.790
and then you get the guy that was like, this.

93
00:05:41.790 --> 00:05:46.470
<v 0>Was a top done of the couple of the game of the Crips from 1980 to</v>

94
00:05:46.471 --> 00:05:49.110
1995. And he was just like, yeah, man. You know,

95
00:05:50.970 --> 00:05:54.690
we had to kill mother just for looking at us the wrong way, man.

96
00:05:54.960 --> 00:05:57.590
We killed about three, four just looking at us wrong way.

97
00:05:58.250 --> 00:06:01.190
We killed by three more, four looking at us the wrong way.

98
00:06:01.400 --> 00:06:04.400
And we killed much more than that for who do one much more than that.

99
00:06:04.401 --> 00:06:07.030
If you know what I mean, and I'm just at home home, like.

100
00:06:07.600 --> 00:06:10.240
<v 1>Hey, get him.</v>

101
00:06:12.220 --> 00:06:16.450
<v 2>This is TV. Are you confessing on video tape?</v>

102
00:06:18.250 --> 00:06:19.083
<v 1>Get him.</v>

103
00:06:20.410 --> 00:06:22.270
<v 2>Cops watching what cops are at home. And just.</v>

00:06:22.270 --> 00:06:24.700
<v 0>Like, it. I'm off duty. I ain't watch it. And I'm not going to get him.</v>

105
00:06:24.880 --> 00:06:27.790
Where am I going? But in a Jacksonville, because that's where all crimes happen.

106
00:06:29.470 --> 00:06:32.140
If a crime didn't happen in Jacksonville, guess what didn't happen?

107
00:06:32.620 --> 00:06:36.040
That's my whole motto. That's how I'm going to run for mayor of Los Angeles.

108
00:06:36.280 --> 00:06:39.160
If a crime didn't happen in Jacksonville, it didn't happen.

109
00:06:40.660 --> 00:06:44.320
Mayor of Jacksonville, Jacksonville sucks. Anyway, uh.
