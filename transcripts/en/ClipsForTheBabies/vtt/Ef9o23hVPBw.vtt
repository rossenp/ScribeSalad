00:00:01.050 --> 00:00:02.790
<v 0>I mean, Quentin, Tarantino's probably like this.</v>

2
00:00:02.790 --> 00:00:05.640
<v 1>I don't know. Hard for celebrities to talk to their section,</v>

3
00:00:05.730 --> 00:00:08.430
to talk to media about their sexuality. This is Tom Hardy.

4
00:00:09.060 --> 00:00:10.290
What on earth do you want about

5
00:00:12.750 --> 00:00:15.690
referring to an interview given to attitude magazine a few years ago,

6
00:00:16.440 --> 00:00:19.610
but what is your question? Nice. Oh, well.

7
00:00:20.420 --> 00:00:23.630
<v 0>Tom Hardy talking about somebody asked him about his sexuality.</v>

8
00:00:23.990 --> 00:00:26.600
<v 1>And it's difficult for celebrities to talk about their sexuality.</v>

9
00:00:26.690 --> 00:00:30.800
I don't find it difficult for celebrities to talk about their sexuality. Um,

10
00:00:30.860 --> 00:00:34.790
are you asking me about my sexuality? Um, Oh.

11
00:00:34.880 --> 00:00:38.480
<v 0>Wow. Just good actors in real life.</v>

12
00:00:38.510 --> 00:00:40.100
Act better than anything in the world.

13
00:00:41.530 --> 00:00:43.940
<v 1>Do you want about, but what is your question?</v>

14
00:00:44.570 --> 00:00:47.180
I was wondering if you find it difficult for celebrities to talk about their

15
00:00:47.181 --> 00:00:48.014
sexuality.

16
00:00:48.020 --> 00:00:52.130
I don't find it difficult for celebrities to talk about their sexuality. Um,

17
00:00:52.190 --> 00:00:55.820
are you asking me about my sexuality? Oh, I'll get the guy crumbles. Sure.

18
00:00:57.080 --> 00:01:01.340
Y Y slammed him. Thank you. Okay.

19
00:01:03.520 --> 00:01:05.090
Oh, wow. Oh dude.

20
00:01:08.660 --> 00:01:10.430
<v 0>Yeah. That's so annoying, dude,</v>

21
00:01:11.390 --> 00:01:15.650
that people want to know if somebody's gay or not or whatever.

22
00:01:15.651 --> 00:01:18.320
I would never tell anybody if I'm straight or gay ever in my life.

23
00:01:18.440 --> 00:01:19.370
If somebody came up to me,

24
00:01:19.371 --> 00:01:23.120
if I hope I get famous enough to where people are just like, Hey Chris, Leah,

25
00:01:23.121 --> 00:01:25.820
what's up with your sexuality. I go like this, not talent,

26
00:01:27.260 --> 00:01:31.430
not talent. Maybe I, maybe I make love to women.

27
00:01:31.550 --> 00:01:35.240
And maybe I dudes all day long. I never tell you.

28
00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:41.300
We need a straight guy to be straight secretly and

29
00:01:41.301 --> 00:01:43.670
never talk about his sexuality and be like, no,

30
00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:46.100
I would never talk to you about my sexual. I'm not, I'm not telling you.

31
00:01:46.250 --> 00:01:49.430
And then we find out later he's married with kids and he was like, Oh,

32
00:01:49.431 --> 00:01:51.110
that was like, Oh, we thought you were hiding it. You were gay. He was like,

33
00:01:51.111 --> 00:01:53.840
why? My sexuality is none of your business. I'm a straight guy.

34
00:01:53.841 --> 00:01:55.010
And I got kids and I'm married,

35
00:01:55.190 --> 00:01:59.480
but I never would admit that because it doesn't matter. Slammed them.

36
00:02:00.740 --> 00:02:02.990
<v 1>As you were reading the script, did you ever.</v>

37
00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:05.390
<v 0>Hollywood celebrities shutting down reporters.</v>

38
00:02:06.470 --> 00:02:09.290
<v 1>And all these women in here? I thought this was supposed to be a man's movie.</v>

39
00:02:13.700 --> 00:02:16.370
No, no. For one minute

40
00:02:19.430 --> 00:02:22.070
you, um, Robert Downey Jr.

41
00:02:22.440 --> 00:02:25.880
The reason I'm asking you about the past is that you you've talked in other

42
00:02:25.881 --> 00:02:28.400
interviews again about, um,

43
00:02:28.460 --> 00:02:31.070
your relationship with your father and.

44
00:02:31.490 --> 00:02:33.860
<v 0>Oh boy, you could see he's already steaming.</v>

45
00:02:34.880 --> 00:02:35.540
<v 1>Oh, okay.</v>

46
00:02:35.540 --> 00:02:39.950
The dark periods you entered and taking drugs and drinking and all of that.

47
00:02:40.520 --> 00:02:43.650
And I just wondered whether, you know, you,

48
00:02:43.651 --> 00:02:47.750
you think you're free of all of that or whether that's still something.

49
00:02:48.110 --> 00:02:52.600
I really don't. What are we doing? Well, I'm just asking questions.

50
00:02:52.790 --> 00:02:54.740
That's all right, bye.

51
00:02:58.040 --> 00:03:00.220
I'm sorry. Oh man.

52
00:03:00.220 --> 00:03:04.600
<v 0>Just saying by, you know, he should have leaned forward and went.</v>

53
00:03:05.680 --> 00:03:07.840
That's what you should do when somebody asks questions. You don't want,

54
00:03:08.050 --> 00:03:08.883
usually before you go like this

55
00:03:10.840 --> 00:03:14.080
and don't even say anything and just wave your hand in their face.

56
00:03:17.310 --> 00:03:21.420
<v 2>Dude. Imagine,</v>

57
00:03:21.810 --> 00:03:23.640
imagine if you just saw somebody like.

58
00:03:23.940 --> 00:03:27.540
<v 0>Jackson, just yeah. So I would like to talk about, and he just doesn't.</v>

59
00:03:27.700 --> 00:03:31.830
He just goes until what are you doing? And then just get up and leave.

60
00:03:32.460 --> 00:03:35.760
You just wave in their face. How for sake, dude.

61
00:03:35.761 --> 00:03:38.820
I got to get so famous so I could do like that. You don't understand, dude,

62
00:03:38.821 --> 00:03:42.930
I'm telling you right now. That's what I'm doing, dude. I can't wait.

63
00:03:44.310 --> 00:03:48.510
You know what the worst name is? Hugh straight up.

64
00:03:48.540 --> 00:03:52.050
The worst name on the planet is he'll. Do you know why it it's?

65
00:03:52.470 --> 00:03:54.810
You it's not even a, it's like a sound.

66
00:03:55.740 --> 00:03:59.520
You can basically say the name Hugh without even using your voice.

67
00:04:02.400 --> 00:04:07.080
That's the name? That name sucks, dude. Hugh Hugh.

68
00:04:08.850 --> 00:04:09.540
Hey, what's up? My name is.
