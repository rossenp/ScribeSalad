00:00:01.020 --> 00:00:02.940
<v 0>My one time.</v>

2
00:00:02.941 --> 00:00:06.960
I was at a strip club when I was 21 dude and my friend was there and he was 20

3
00:00:07.350 --> 00:00:10.890
and he went up to the bro. I don't go up to the stage.

4
00:00:11.100 --> 00:00:13.980
I chill back like a mob boss. When I go to the strip club,

5
00:00:14.200 --> 00:00:18.270
haven't been in a long time, but when I go, I sit back like a mob boss, man.

6
00:00:18.750 --> 00:00:22.200
You think I don't cross my legs at the strip club. Oh bro. You're crazy, man.

7
00:00:25.110 --> 00:00:28.380
I cross one leg over my onto my leg.

8
00:00:29.100 --> 00:00:32.850
I'm real British at the strip club dude, but I'm also an Italian mobster dude.

9
00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:37.470
And I lay back and I sip a club soda or nothing. Dude.

10
00:00:37.471 --> 00:00:38.790
I got to feel good in my environment.

11
00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:42.720
One of the reasons why I don't smoke is cause I, I didn't need to,

12
00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:45.690
I don't want to have to do when I take a break.

13
00:00:45.720 --> 00:00:47.670
I want you to know I'm taking a break.

14
00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:51.990
I don't want always got to go do something. No, no, no, no. Dude.

15
00:00:51.991 --> 00:00:55.830
I straight up got to get away if I'm at a party,

16
00:00:55.860 --> 00:00:57.060
which I never am.

17
00:00:58.290 --> 00:01:02.190
If I'm at a party and some going on and I got to take a break,

18
00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:07.380
I go outside and I await dude. I feel it in my body.

19
00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:10.380
I used to be uncomfortable taking a break. I didn't have a cigarette.

20
00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:13.110
I wasn't checking my cell phone. They weren't around cell phones.

21
00:01:13.111 --> 00:01:17.430
Weren't around. And now cell phones around. Sometimes I took my cell phone,

22
00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:19.470
but you best believe I could just take a break,

23
00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:22.860
sit outside and wait with my hands in my pockets. People like, what's he doing?

24
00:01:22.861 --> 00:01:26.790
Just staring at the sky, man. That's a break.

25
00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:30.900
I'm not fidgety, dude. I'm not fidgety.

26
00:01:33.570 --> 00:01:38.340
Learn that from my dad. He just chills. And that's the thing. I uh,

27
00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:41.880
so I would go to the strip club and sit back like a mob boss, dude.

28
00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:48.770
And then in the, on the, on the, uh, on the, um, on the stage,

29
00:01:48.771 --> 00:01:51.650
some people would do go walk up to the stage and sit at the stage.

30
00:01:51.770 --> 00:01:54.410
And one time my friend, he was 20. I was 21. He was 20.

31
00:01:54.411 --> 00:01:56.780
He walked up to this stage and he put his fevers.

32
00:01:56.810 --> 00:02:01.040
Like his face was all up in it. And the girl was dancing around like that.

33
00:02:02.120 --> 00:02:06.020
And she was excusing her boobs and stuff. So juvenile. And by the way,

34
00:02:06.021 --> 00:02:09.950
what word do you use for to not sound like a creep for real

35
00:02:11.210 --> 00:02:15.410
boobs. I'm 39 T if I say yeah, her were good.

36
00:02:15.411 --> 00:02:20.240
I seem like a Crip. If I say, yeah, our boobs, what am I? 12? What do you say?

37
00:02:23.930 --> 00:02:28.250
Jugs? You sound like a. You know what I mean? Breasts.

38
00:02:28.280 --> 00:02:30.650
Then you sound like, what are you doing? You try not to sound like a creep,

39
00:02:30.651 --> 00:02:34.760
which makes it creepier. So what the is it? Come up with some Tatas.

40
00:02:34.880 --> 00:02:39.110
Then you're just an. You know what I mean? Like cringe. I'm going to say

41
00:02:41.210 --> 00:02:41.210
[inaudible]. That's what I'm going to say. Ah, yeah. Did you see your booboo

42
00:02:41.210 --> 00:02:42.043
bullies at least then I'm owning it bro. [inaudible].

43
00:02:55.100 --> 00:02:55.933
<v 1>Okay.</v>

44
00:02:56.240 --> 00:02:57.200
<v 0>Booby. Luby's that's what I'm going to.</v>

45
00:03:02.010 --> 00:03:05.190
Uh, anyway, we're at the strip club and she was working it.

46
00:03:05.191 --> 00:03:08.550
This was before twerk and she was just regular work in it, not to work in it.

47
00:03:09.150 --> 00:03:14.100
And she was just moving her booby Luby's around and just holding them,

48
00:03:14.340 --> 00:03:17.460
the booby Luby's and sitting around and gyrating and.

49
00:03:17.940 --> 00:03:22.230
And I'm sitting back in a mob dos, like I had a cigarette, but I didn't. Okay.

50
00:03:23.220 --> 00:03:27.690
I was just chilling B and me being inside me.

51
00:03:28.020 --> 00:03:30.390
You understand reveling in it.

52
00:03:31.830 --> 00:03:36.120
I was my body inside my body. You understand? I'm a author.

53
00:03:37.080 --> 00:03:40.800
And I was watching my buddy going like this, his face.

54
00:03:41.220 --> 00:03:43.590
So close to booby. Luby's right. And he was,

55
00:03:43.650 --> 00:03:46.620
and she was doing the thing and she brings her booby Luby's over to him.

56
00:03:46.890 --> 00:03:50.790
And I see it from afar. Okay. Like a, my bus.

57
00:03:52.980 --> 00:03:53.813
<v 1>And.</v>

58
00:03:54.270 --> 00:03:59.010
<v 0>I see some go down and then he backs up a little bit casually.</v>

59
00:03:59.760 --> 00:04:02.820
And then he walks over to me and my other buddy, who I was with.

60
00:04:05.700 --> 00:04:07.230
And my other buddy was a really tall,

61
00:04:07.231 --> 00:04:09.090
big guy that has nothing to do with this story.

62
00:04:09.150 --> 00:04:11.430
But I want you to know a little bit about the surroundings.

63
00:04:13.590 --> 00:04:17.850
So he walks up to me and this guy was a little guy and that has nothing to do

64
00:04:17.851 --> 00:04:21.840
with the story. But I want you to understand the color of the seat.

65
00:04:22.980 --> 00:04:26.940
He walks up to me and something's wrong. Okay.

66
00:04:27.330 --> 00:04:30.330
Now I know something's wrong because I know my friend,

67
00:04:30.480 --> 00:04:35.040
but I also know something's wrong because you don't sit at the

68
00:04:35.041 --> 00:04:37.470
stage at the strip club,

69
00:04:37.980 --> 00:04:40.440
especially alone.

70
00:04:42.120 --> 00:04:42.953
<v 1>Now.</v>

71
00:04:43.200 --> 00:04:45.240
<v 0>He walks up to me and he says, guys, I don't know what to say.</v>

72
00:04:45.241 --> 00:04:46.290
And I don't know how to say it.

73
00:04:49.290 --> 00:04:50.123
<v 1>[Inaudible].</v>

74
00:04:50.130 --> 00:04:53.610
<v 0>And we lean forward, like, yes,</v>

75
00:04:54.120 --> 00:04:57.600
because we want to hear it because we want to die of laughter.

76
00:04:58.740 --> 00:05:01.800
And he says, but it's true.

77
00:05:03.570 --> 00:05:06.840
She escorted her breast milk in my, in my, at my nose.

78
00:05:06.841 --> 00:05:10.080
And it dripped in my mouth a little bit. Oh, that's what he said, dude,

79
00:05:10.980 --> 00:05:14.040
that's the sentence he said, and I never forgot it.

80
00:05:15.150 --> 00:05:17.970
She squirted her breast milk on my nose and it got in my mouth a little bit.

81
00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:21.930
And that was the sentence said, and I never forgot it.

82
00:05:24.480 --> 00:05:28.590
There's only before or after that moment in my life.

83
00:05:28.680 --> 00:05:33.660
And there's only before or after that moment in [inaudible]. Cause

84
00:05:33.660 --> 00:05:34.493
 he drank not his mom's breasts.

85
00:05:37.050 --> 00:05:37.883
<v 1>Okay.</v>

86
00:05:39.900 --> 00:05:43.530
<v 0>And dude, we fell out me and the big guy.</v>

87
00:05:45.570 --> 00:05:46.680
<v 1>We fell out.</v>

88
00:05:48.540 --> 00:05:52.620
<v 0>Our mob boss, chillin was all tattered.</v>

89
00:05:52.980 --> 00:05:56.730
We fell out. We were again 12.

90
00:05:58.970 --> 00:06:03.050
And then the best part was he told us after she did it, he,

91
00:06:03.060 --> 00:06:07.370
she squeezed it like a, like as fruit. And it shot out, hit his nose.

92
00:06:07.371 --> 00:06:11.300
I went into his mouth a little bit and do it. She, she, after that,

93
00:06:11.301 --> 00:06:12.200
she goes like this

94
00:06:14.570 --> 00:06:18.890
and did a finger up to his thing. Her, her mouth, like she, like, he was like,

95
00:06:18.891 --> 00:06:21.140
he was talking at the L in the library,

96
00:06:21.890 --> 00:06:26.270
like it was a treat for him. Hey lady,

97
00:06:26.450 --> 00:06:31.010
don't squirt milk in my nose. Especially if it comes from your body,

98
00:06:31.730 --> 00:06:34.670
B a U D Y dude,

99
00:06:38.330 --> 00:06:40.190
not a turn-on.

100
00:06:41.810 --> 00:06:46.220
Then we told it to another one of our buddies later. And he was like,

101
00:06:46.460 --> 00:06:50.030
I think I'd like that. K.

102
00:06:51.320 --> 00:06:54.530
And we were like, what, bro? He was like, I don't know.

103
00:06:54.531 --> 00:06:58.790
It kind of turned me on once I was with a girl who was recently a mom and,

104
00:06:59.630 --> 00:07:03.470
and mil and I drank it a little bit out of her and it kind of turned me on and I

105
00:07:03.471 --> 00:07:04.304
was like.

106
00:07:09.010 --> 00:07:09.843
<v 1>Uh.</v>

107
00:07:15.130 --> 00:07:15.963
<v 0>Drive by</v>

108
00:07:17.800 --> 00:07:22.390
single-shot F it wasn't even a automatic from an automatic rifle.

109
00:07:22.690 --> 00:07:23.523
It was a.

110
00:07:24.190 --> 00:07:25.023
<v 1>Uh.</v>

111
00:07:32.440 --> 00:07:36.460
<v 0>Dude, are you kidding, man? What the?</v>

112
00:07:42.820 --> 00:07:47.650
Uh, God dude, strip clubs shenanigans. So funny, man.
