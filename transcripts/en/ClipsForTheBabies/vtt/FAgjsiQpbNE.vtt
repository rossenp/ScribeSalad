1
00:00:00.600 --> 00:00:02.280
<v 0>Dude. All right, look, or this is what I'm going to do.</v>

2
00:00:02.340 --> 00:00:05.550
I'm going to talk about this because it's been in my notes for literally five

3
00:00:05.551 --> 00:00:09.090
months. It's called. I wrote down the deserve at scale. All right.

4
00:00:09.330 --> 00:00:12.360
Now one fire is always like, what the is the deserve at scale?

5
00:00:13.470 --> 00:00:17.160
And it's been on the notes and we laugh because it's so dumb.

6
00:00:18.210 --> 00:00:22.110
The deserve it scale made about as much sense to him as a scab. All right.

7
00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:25.380
The deserve its scale is,

8
00:00:26.340 --> 00:00:29.880
is I think we might've maybe touched on this in a podcast before, but

9
00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:36.390
a video online of a guy falling,

10
00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:43.170
just the guy falling and he doesn't deserve it is

11
00:00:43.171 --> 00:00:46.980
not as, I mean, it can be funny. There's always exceptions,

12
00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:52.260
but the deserve its scale is what makes it funny to me.

13
00:00:52.650 --> 00:00:53.483
Okay.

14
00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:58.830
If a guy's twirling plates on a basketball and falls down,

15
00:00:59.970 --> 00:01:03.360
his dessert scale is off the charts and I'm

16
00:01:04.540 --> 00:01:08.570
harder because he's a, yeah, you understand?

17
00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:11.420
I know he's going to fall. And he doesn't.

18
00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:17.120
There was a video of a kid

19
00:01:17.570 --> 00:01:20.060
on top of referral of a, of a cupboard.

20
00:01:20.750 --> 00:01:24.680
This was a long time ago in, um,

21
00:01:26.510 --> 00:01:28.520
on America's funniest, home videos. You know,

22
00:01:29.060 --> 00:01:30.410
back when the internet wasn't a thing.

23
00:01:30.980 --> 00:01:34.310
And this kid was on the top of the cupboard and he was going to scary,

24
00:01:34.330 --> 00:01:36.320
set up the camera was going to scare his family.

25
00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:40.790
And it was just going to be great, right? Set up the whole thing.

26
00:01:41.030 --> 00:01:45.950
The kid goes around here and slips his pants catch on the top of the cupboard

27
00:01:46.640 --> 00:01:50.450
and he falls down and his crack is facing the camera.

28
00:01:50.480 --> 00:01:55.370
Now that deserve it. Scale is off the charts because he set it all up,

29
00:01:55.880 --> 00:01:58.730
stood on the cupboard and waited for his dad.

30
00:01:59.630 --> 00:02:04.310
So it was so funny, dude. Here's another good one, man.

31
00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:09.410
One time there was a guy skiing down a mountain, bro. I lost my at this. Okay.

32
00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:14.210
And he was skiing down the mountain and the guy was at the bottom of the

33
00:02:14.660 --> 00:02:19.430
slope filming it. He was like, okay, here we come. Join up. Like so far away,

34
00:02:19.670 --> 00:02:23.870
the guy was just sh sh sh sh doing the that scares you.

35
00:02:24.410 --> 00:02:27.470
Sh sh sh you're a super of your skiing, you know?

36
00:02:28.340 --> 00:02:33.020
And he gets close to the guy with the camera and the guy with the

37
00:02:33.021 --> 00:02:37.100
camera, you can just sense. You know,

38
00:02:37.190 --> 00:02:41.300
there was just like a sense that he had where he was like, uh, Oh,

39
00:02:41.360 --> 00:02:46.010
some about to go down and the guy go,

40
00:02:46.011 --> 00:02:49.580
the guy skiing says, Oh, sorry, Chris.

41
00:02:50.360 --> 00:02:53.000
And then smashes into the guy with the camera

42
00:02:56.330 --> 00:03:01.030
because he said, sorry, before I, bro,

43
00:03:01.031 --> 00:03:02.620
if you know, you're going to up,

44
00:03:02.621 --> 00:03:06.040
can't stop and apologize beforehand.

45
00:03:07.240 --> 00:03:10.360
The deserve at scale. So high, first of all,

46
00:03:11.050 --> 00:03:13.540
don't even shoot it. Just let the guy live life.

47
00:03:15.460 --> 00:03:19.600
The best deserve. At scale though, I ever saw was at a wedding.

48
00:03:19.690 --> 00:03:24.670
This was the funniest home videos. I've looked this video up forever online.

49
00:03:25.510 --> 00:03:29.770
There was a wedding going on. And the,

50
00:03:30.520 --> 00:03:35.110
I guess it was the groom that on the indoors wedding,

51
00:03:35.950 --> 00:03:38.530
in a gymnasium or wherever the, this thing was,

52
00:03:39.220 --> 00:03:44.020
he gets on the motorcycle that was

53
00:03:44.021 --> 00:03:46.810
there for some reason at K.

54
00:03:47.980 --> 00:03:51.040
Now the deserve its scale,

55
00:03:51.041 --> 00:03:55.120
dude is that Mach 10. All right.

56
00:03:55.510 --> 00:04:00.040
This guy's on a first of all motorcycle in a

57
00:04:00.041 --> 00:04:01.660
gymnasium.

58
00:04:02.470 --> 00:04:05.500
That's not it at a wedding.

59
00:04:05.980 --> 00:04:10.060
That's not it at his wedding. All right.

60
00:04:10.840 --> 00:04:15.610
The deserve its scale. I mean, if there was a weight sensor, it would be.

61
00:04:22.020 --> 00:04:22.853
<v 1>[Inaudible].</v>

62
00:04:25.380 --> 00:04:30.090
<v 0>Okay. Now this guy revs it and he is just,</v>

63
00:04:30.150 --> 00:04:33.480
he seems dope as. Okay.

64
00:04:35.340 --> 00:04:39.720
Cause he had on, I remember he had on like a, not a traditional thing.

65
00:04:39.750 --> 00:04:42.570
He had him like a cool thing cause he wanted to look cool on the motorcycle

66
00:04:42.571 --> 00:04:44.340
thing. And,

67
00:04:44.940 --> 00:04:49.720
and he went to take off and he got

68
00:04:50.220 --> 00:04:54.360
wrong and obviously didn't know how to ride a motorcycle that well,

69
00:04:54.450 --> 00:04:58.860
because he didn't let go of the handle and the motorcycle kept going.

70
00:04:59.070 --> 00:05:02.700
And he was doing like the womb and he tried to stand up off of it because it got

71
00:05:02.800 --> 00:05:06.360
to him and the motorcycle went into all the decorations and took out all the

72
00:05:06.361 --> 00:05:10.500
decorations and ruin the wedding dude. And I cried.

73
00:05:11.100 --> 00:05:13.890
The disservice scale was Mach 10.

74
00:05:15.480 --> 00:05:20.250
And I think that's when I created the dessert scale when I was a kid. Anyway,

75
00:05:20.700 --> 00:05:24.360
what I want you to do because I love dessert. Scale videos.

76
00:05:25.200 --> 00:05:30.030
Send your favorite deserve at scale videos. Okay. Now,

77
00:05:30.750 --> 00:05:33.600
you know, there's different levels. Like the skiing one wasn't so high,

78
00:05:34.140 --> 00:05:37.740
but the motorcycle at the wedding one was just off the charts. Right?

79
00:05:37.980 --> 00:05:40.530
You ever see the grape smash one where the girl's like, okay.

80
00:05:40.560 --> 00:05:44.520
And go and they're on a level up and they're smashing the grapes and it's a,

81
00:05:45.330 --> 00:05:49.140
you know, middle-aged woman. That's like portly and she's like, go, go, go, go,

82
00:05:49.141 --> 00:05:53.840
go, go, go. And then she falls off of the level thing. And then he's like, Oh.

83
00:05:56.460 --> 00:05:58.100
<v 1>Oh you remember that? Did.</v>

84
00:05:58.100 --> 00:06:02.390
<v 0>You ever see it fire at one fire? You seen it? Oh man, let's watch that one.</v>

85
00:06:02.720 --> 00:06:06.950
That one is such a high desert scale. Oh man.

86
00:06:06.951 --> 00:06:09.770
When I would watch this on E bombs world, when I was 12,

87
00:06:10.220 --> 00:06:11.990
smashing fail.

88
00:06:14.780 --> 00:06:19.490
She's so out of breath, great lady falls. Original. Sad to be the great lady.

89
00:06:19.810 --> 00:06:22.000
<v 2>What kind of grid? These are filled with chamber sin,</v>

90
00:06:22.001 --> 00:06:26.380
grapes and the winner this Saturday, he stopped music, eating international.

91
00:06:26.600 --> 00:06:27.700
<v 0>Best thing is they both,</v>

92
00:06:27.730 --> 00:06:31.690
they both have zero clue that this about to go down.

93
00:06:32.050 --> 00:06:35.650
And my favorite thing about it is I know it's going to go down.

94
00:06:36.040 --> 00:06:39.100
That's the best because otherwise, why would it even be on the internet?

95
00:06:40.270 --> 00:06:40.601
One dude,

96
00:06:40.601 --> 00:06:44.620
I used to love America's home videos because they would show the video.

97
00:06:44.860 --> 00:06:48.010
And you knew you were smarter than the idiot on the camera.

98
00:06:48.490 --> 00:06:52.120
You knew some was going to go down and they had no idea.

99
00:06:52.420 --> 00:06:55.450
And I would just sit there, giddy with this, Oh,

100
00:06:55.510 --> 00:06:57.850
I can't wait for this guy to fall. And they would fall. And I would,

101
00:06:58.060 --> 00:07:02.920
the would just be an Uber sensation or they

102
00:07:03.070 --> 00:07:03.903
are so here they are.

103
00:07:04.180 --> 00:07:07.240
<v 2>This Saturday, he's talking music, eating international foods,</v>

104
00:07:07.480 --> 00:07:09.880
having wine tours and tastings, vineyard.

105
00:07:11.290 --> 00:07:13.690
<v 0>Platform. That's like, I mean,</v>

106
00:07:13.691 --> 00:07:18.640
it's like three and a half feet up. What?

107
00:07:18.641 --> 00:07:21.820
A bad idea dude.

108
00:07:22.330 --> 00:07:25.030
And why are they wearing the same thing? Cause they work for the place.

109
00:07:25.031 --> 00:07:27.200
And it's a sad, the whole thing. Here we go.

110
00:07:27.280 --> 00:07:29.470
<v 2>Seminars, arts and crafts. Oh.</v>

111
00:07:29.470 --> 00:07:31.300
<v 0>I remember what happens to before we've been watching.</v>

112
00:07:31.480 --> 00:07:33.310
She stops and they're like, okay, stop.

113
00:07:33.490 --> 00:07:35.430
And then th this is what made it extra funny. She was like, wait, wait,

114
00:07:35.431 --> 00:07:37.270
wait a little bit more. And that's when she falls.

115
00:07:37.720 --> 00:07:39.610
<v 2>It's a lot of fun. A whole day. Stop</v>

116
00:07:48.350 --> 00:07:50.620
I'll stop. Oh

117
00:07:55.990 --> 00:07:59.950
no. Oh dear. She's actually hurt. Oh yeah buddy.

118
00:08:00.970 --> 00:08:02.980
<v 0>You say that you regular guy.</v>

119
00:08:04.900 --> 00:08:08.470
<v 2>And the winner this Saturday he's stopped music, eating international,</v>

120
00:08:09.160 --> 00:08:13.900
having wine, tasting tours, seminars, arts, and crafts.

121
00:08:14.410 --> 00:08:15.820
It's a lot of fun a whole day.

122
00:08:16.330 --> 00:08:20.110
<v 0>Okay. She says stop. Now. She's even though it's a joke.</v>

123
00:08:20.620 --> 00:08:25.180
It's it's what you gets. It's what you gets, man. I'm sorry lady.

124
00:08:25.930 --> 00:08:29.500
But you're on a four-foot platform up. That is so small.

125
00:08:29.680 --> 00:08:33.550
It could be an elevator. It's the size of an elevator.

126
00:08:33.970 --> 00:08:37.480
And then you're stomping, slippery, gray.

127
00:08:39.610 --> 00:08:43.930
And then you don't stop after you say stop. And even as a joke,

128
00:08:44.020 --> 00:08:47.980
that's not the rules lady. You said stop. You said it by the way.

129
00:08:48.640 --> 00:08:52.270
And then she goes, she goes a little bit more like a

130
00:08:57.800 --> 00:08:58.670
We've all been there.

131
00:08:58.880 --> 00:09:03.650
She can't not breathe out because it hit and she can't not breathe

132
00:09:03.680 --> 00:09:04.513
out.

133
00:09:04.790 --> 00:09:08.900
She's in so much pain that she just lets a little bit of sound out and it just

134
00:09:08.901 --> 00:09:09.734
turns into.

135
00:09:11.480 --> 00:09:11.660
<v 2>She.</v>

136
00:09:11.660 --> 00:09:15.680
<v 0>Can't think of breath in bro. That's so funny. I feel bad,</v>

137
00:09:17.270 --> 00:09:21.560
but she's probably okay. That's the other thing too. If you know,

138
00:09:21.561 --> 00:09:24.320
they've done some permanent damage and it's not funny anymore.

139
00:09:24.470 --> 00:09:27.860
Cause you feel bad, but I think this lady's okay. She's at the top.

140
00:09:27.920 --> 00:09:30.500
She's at the top level of, I think she's okay.

141
00:09:30.980 --> 00:09:33.500
Is she went any further than it's not okay.

142
00:09:33.501 --> 00:09:36.620
Like those skateboarding videos where people fall down and break their femurs.

143
00:09:36.860 --> 00:09:38.780
I'm not into that. This here.

144
00:09:41.810 --> 00:09:42.500
She saying stop.

145
00:09:42.500 --> 00:09:45.320
She doesn't realize what she's saying because there's nothing to be stopped.

146
00:09:45.980 --> 00:09:46.551
That's the best.

147
00:09:46.551 --> 00:09:50.360
That's also very funny because he's just saying stop because she's like praying

148
00:09:50.361 --> 00:09:53.480
to the gods that this should stop, but she can't.

149
00:09:53.810 --> 00:09:55.070
<v 2>Oh</v>

150
00:10:00.980 --> 00:10:04.070
no. I think she is actually hurt. No, I think she is.

151
00:10:04.760 --> 00:10:09.380
She took a hard fall off there. Oh gosh. I hope she's okay. Okay.

152
00:10:09.710 --> 00:10:13.280
We're going to make sure she is check on her and get back to you as soon as we

153
00:10:13.281 --> 00:10:14.780
can. And we'll be back right after this.

154
00:10:16.460 --> 00:10:18.950
<v 0>Oh man. Okay. Let's read about her here.</v>

155
00:10:21.360 --> 00:10:24.170
We'll go up. Yeah. So, okay. Oh wow. There's a whole story here.

156
00:10:27.440 --> 00:10:27.981
Oh, okay.

157
00:10:27.981 --> 00:10:31.310
Melissa Sanders was a reporter for an Atlanta TV station in the late nineties,

158
00:10:31.311 --> 00:10:33.980
doing a fluff report from a local winery.

159
00:10:33.981 --> 00:10:37.490
She participated in an impromptu grape stomping contest when disaster

160
00:10:37.491 --> 00:10:41.030
hilariously struck memoed appearance. If this is what I was saying,

161
00:10:41.031 --> 00:10:43.370
if you really want to show your kids that cheaters never prosper,

162
00:10:43.371 --> 00:10:45.860
you might want to consider using this video as visual aid. Exactly.

163
00:10:45.861 --> 00:10:48.860
Even though it was a light competition, you stop. When you say stop.

164
00:10:49.100 --> 00:10:51.500
After being told that time was upstate standard.

165
00:10:51.950 --> 00:10:56.450
By the way it was her that said the time was up. I mean, look at the way.

166
00:10:56.451 --> 00:10:56.991
This is written.

167
00:10:56.991 --> 00:11:01.790
Sander kept stomping and was quickly slapped

168
00:11:01.791 --> 00:11:04.220
by the hand of fate tumbling over the side.

169
00:11:04.221 --> 00:11:09.080
You know her Waldorf like screams while obviously, I mean wrote this.

170
00:11:10.670 --> 00:11:15.290
Well obviously I'm using her to our coworkers in the studio. No, they were sad.

171
00:11:16.130 --> 00:11:17.510
Seem to indicate a serious injury.

172
00:11:18.650 --> 00:11:21.530
There's somebody in the comments section claiming Sandra broke several ribs and

173
00:11:21.531 --> 00:11:25.520
almost died. Oh, come on. They think it's funnier that way.

174
00:11:25.521 --> 00:11:30.470
They're saying push it, go back up. She was fine. Said she was fine.

175
00:11:30.500 --> 00:11:31.640
Click on that. Oh wait, hold on.

176
00:11:31.641 --> 00:11:34.280
And by the way was basically her fault because they chose to film facing the

177
00:11:34.281 --> 00:11:38.180
side. Yeah. Really? Without railings click on that.

178
00:11:39.470 --> 00:11:43.820
No that, Oh you got it. Oh, okay.

179
00:11:45.020 --> 00:11:48.140
Go back. Yeah. Go read down. I want to read down. According to bloggers,

180
00:11:48.141 --> 00:11:51.530
who've tried to track her down shortly after the incident sander left Atlanta

181
00:11:51.531 --> 00:11:52.161
for Albany,

182
00:11:52.161 --> 00:11:55.930
which we're sure had nothing to do with the fact that the in-studio reports were

183
00:11:55.931 --> 00:11:58.780
barely holding back giggles at her pain yodeling.

184
00:12:01.390 --> 00:12:06.010
Our bio page has a bio page and Albany makes no mud,

185
00:12:06.210 --> 00:12:09.520
no mention of a near death experience due to Pierce appear salon,

186
00:12:09.521 --> 00:12:11.530
which further supports. I mean, what the is this? You know,

187
00:12:11.800 --> 00:12:14.680
people will just be like, think anything's a conspiracy.

188
00:12:15.310 --> 00:12:17.950
She's no longer the jaw dropped off the face of the earth.

189
00:12:18.850 --> 00:12:23.230
Let's try to find her, you know, go up, go up,

190
00:12:24.130 --> 00:12:27.430
click her bio page right there. Oh, there it is.

191
00:12:28.300 --> 00:12:32.740
It's probably not up anymore. Right? Yeah. It's not there anymore.

192
00:12:33.520 --> 00:12:38.200
Well, we wish her all the best here it congratulations. You know? Um,

193
00:12:39.340 --> 00:12:42.490
but the deserve at scale was mighty high on that one.

194
00:12:42.880 --> 00:12:47.800
Wasn't quite as big as the motorcycle in the but man.

195
00:12:47.910 --> 00:12:48.870
<v 1>No railings.</v>

196
00:12:53.040 --> 00:12:56.340
<v 0>Uh, if I was working there and that happened while she was falling, I'd be like,</v>

197
00:12:56.640 --> 00:12:57.330
we knew it.
