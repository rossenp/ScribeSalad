00:00:00.540 --> 00:00:04.860
<v 0>You know, what I don't get is this, you know what? I don't get dude, this,</v>

2
00:00:05.130 --> 00:00:06.780
this reclining seat argument,

3
00:00:07.770 --> 00:00:10.980
this reclining seat argument where the video went viral.

4
00:00:10.981 --> 00:00:15.810
I tweeted it when the dude was the lady reclined seat and the has ho

5
00:00:15.811 --> 00:00:19.770
dude behind her was like punching the back of her seat

6
00:00:20.610 --> 00:00:23.280
because he thought it was disrespectful that she reclined the seat.

7
00:00:26.660 --> 00:00:31.280
Dude was just trying to watch videos on his phone. Hey dude, you're a, man.

8
00:00:31.880 --> 00:00:36.050
It to see reclines, let it recline Johnnie Cochran.

9
00:00:37.250 --> 00:00:41.870
If the CBRE class let them recline, but dude let it recline, man.

10
00:00:42.080 --> 00:00:46.220
The seat reclines and the guy's like, Oh yeah, yeah. I don't know people.

11
00:00:46.221 --> 00:00:48.680
I can't believe there's people out there that actually are like, no,

12
00:00:48.681 --> 00:00:52.280
it's disrespectful to recline your seat, bro. I paid for it.

13
00:00:52.310 --> 00:00:53.900
Also the seat reclines.

14
00:00:54.170 --> 00:00:59.030
I'm not rejiggering the seat to make it recline it reclines. Therefore,

15
00:00:59.090 --> 00:01:03.350
if my seat goes to your tank, swear to God,

16
00:01:03.830 --> 00:01:06.950
don't take it up with Delta, man.

17
00:01:07.580 --> 00:01:11.360
This is a my problem. Yeah. How about this?

18
00:01:11.450 --> 00:01:13.820
Check in and get a better seats to your seat.

19
00:01:14.630 --> 00:01:16.430
Reclines to the guys all in the back wall, bro.

20
00:01:16.431 --> 00:01:19.310
Just because you're in competence doesn't mean she shouldn't be comfortable.

21
00:01:19.820 --> 00:01:23.210
that. I cannot believe this has.

22
00:01:23.211 --> 00:01:27.260
Dude is trying to watch what is he trying to watch some movie on his,

23
00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:32.150
on his privileged iPhone. And he's just bumping her head like that in front.

24
00:01:32.330 --> 00:01:37.040
The lady is like 50 years old. This guy's younger than me.

25
00:01:37.070 --> 00:01:41.540
If you can believe that. And this guy, what a dude,

26
00:01:41.570 --> 00:01:45.260
of course he's got just a beard too. And a bald head. Those guys are the most, a

27
00:01:47.660 --> 00:01:52.490
DNO or the most submits guy is a guy who's got hair this long

28
00:01:53.070 --> 00:01:57.560
and, and a completely shaved face and it's jelled and there's one little piece

29
00:01:58.130 --> 00:02:03.050
coming forward, you know? Oh he roses. You know what he does?

30
00:02:03.080 --> 00:02:07.700
He rolls his, um, uh, sleeves up like this.

31
00:02:09.200 --> 00:02:12.710
He does it like this, like against his, the side.

32
00:02:14.780 --> 00:02:18.590
That's so, dude, that he's doing that. And it makes me angry. And I want to,

33
00:02:18.680 --> 00:02:20.510
I want to live with that girl and take care of her,

34
00:02:20.511 --> 00:02:21.590
even though she's older than me,

35
00:02:22.040 --> 00:02:26.450
because that's so insane and insensitive to do that. That guy's a ho

36
00:02:28.970 --> 00:02:32.090
like let her recline, she paid for it.

37
00:02:34.370 --> 00:02:38.810
Wow dude. And I can't stop thinking about when Peter Pablo says,

38
00:02:39.620 --> 00:02:42.020
eh, and I say Heineken because I love it. I love it.

39
00:02:42.080 --> 00:02:45.860
And they pay me for it in his song. Cool. How I keep thinking about that.

40
00:02:46.880 --> 00:02:50.750
But um, yeah dude, that's so insane.

41
00:02:50.960 --> 00:02:55.280
And so also when I, you don't understand, man,

42
00:02:55.340 --> 00:03:00.040
when I'm, and this happens rarely because I check and also,

43
00:03:00.730 --> 00:03:05.560
you know, now bags bags. Of course I fly first class,

44
00:03:05.561 --> 00:03:06.820
but you know,

45
00:03:06.821 --> 00:03:11.410
when I was in the back back and somebody goes and reclines into my chest

46
00:03:11.411 --> 00:03:15.430
region, guess what? There we go. I'm dealing with something.

47
00:03:15.460 --> 00:03:16.450
That's all that's happening.

48
00:03:17.050 --> 00:03:21.790
I'm relaxing as best I can with someone's face in my,

49
00:03:21.910 --> 00:03:26.860
in my chest. I'll give him a massage dude. Cause I up and I know it and great.

50
00:03:26.861 --> 00:03:30.220
I'll make the best of a bad situation. I up. I'll give him a scalp massage.

51
00:03:31.300 --> 00:03:35.410
I'll put my feet over there, you know,

52
00:03:35.470 --> 00:03:37.900
torso and give them a scalp massage.

53
00:03:38.500 --> 00:03:42.820
Like I'm some monkey on their back helping out because dude, you up,

54
00:03:42.821 --> 00:03:45.790
you got the last seat. You don't have to get the last seat.

55
00:03:49.890 --> 00:03:52.500
Airline F everything about flying is uncomfortable, everything.

56
00:03:53.550 --> 00:03:55.680
So just suck it up.

57
00:03:56.820 --> 00:04:01.590
You think we want to be here 30,000 feet in the air? If yeah,

58
00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:06.660
I don't get it. I don't get, I don't like when people are disrespectful,

59
00:04:06.690 --> 00:04:11.190
I don't get how people think that the reclining,

60
00:04:11.191 --> 00:04:12.930
the seat thing is disrespectful. And you know what?

61
00:04:13.080 --> 00:04:16.440
I don't want to hear any of it anymore. I don't want to hear anybody being like,

62
00:04:16.590 --> 00:04:19.530
well, let's consider it too. No, dude. It is not. It is considerate.

63
00:04:20.040 --> 00:04:22.680
It's actually considered to not fly. How about that drive?

64
00:04:25.170 --> 00:04:27.780
When someone reclines, when I,

65
00:04:27.800 --> 00:04:32.610
when I reclined all the way back and it goes into somebody's lap, if I,

66
00:04:32.730 --> 00:04:36.720
I hope it goes back far enough to where I could open my eyes and see them upside

67
00:04:36.721 --> 00:04:39.030
down. And then I want to say, you're welcome.

68
00:04:39.570 --> 00:04:42.120
I'm being respectful because this is what I want to do.

69
00:04:42.300 --> 00:04:45.930
And we're all in this together. One time I was on the plane.

70
00:04:48.810 --> 00:04:50.490
One time I was, uh, I was, uh,

71
00:04:50.550 --> 00:04:55.350
on the plane and this guy I like was trying to turn my TV on and I was hitting

72
00:04:55.351 --> 00:04:57.510
the button on the TV, in front of it, you know, the headrest in front of it.

73
00:04:58.170 --> 00:05:02.010
And the guy turns around and he says, this is my seat. That's yours.

74
00:05:02.880 --> 00:05:05.160
And I was like, bro,

75
00:05:06.360 --> 00:05:10.800
it's crazy how people just go zero to 60 when they're in public,

76
00:05:11.130 --> 00:05:14.280
like already off about their situation.

77
00:05:18.780 --> 00:05:21.300
Nah, you don't need to be like that. I'll go like that. Nah,

78
00:05:21.301 --> 00:05:24.150
you don't need to be like that. Why are you telling me that sir?

79
00:05:24.750 --> 00:05:27.870
People were saying that Europeans don't recline seats, which is stupid, dude.

80
00:05:27.900 --> 00:05:30.360
I see them British too. It's just like, Oh the way back home. Right?

81
00:05:31.650 --> 00:05:33.930
People were saying British. Oh yeah, Europeans. They don't recline seats.

82
00:05:33.931 --> 00:05:36.720
So why? Because they respect bro. No way. Yeah.

83
00:05:37.440 --> 00:05:40.800
Elite British people respect. But bro, have you seen

84
00:05:43.020 --> 00:05:46.140
[inaudible]? I was sitting on my seat all the way back into your penis.

85
00:05:46.141 --> 00:05:50.130
That's what I'll do. And I'll start sucking it. I'm not even gay. it.

86
00:05:50.131 --> 00:05:54.810
I don't care. I've got to keep my mouth busy on his flight. Go quicker. Yeah.

87
00:05:55.080 --> 00:05:58.600
RA I don't care. Oh, we clone all the way back to Hormel.

88
00:05:58.601 --> 00:06:01.040
I don't know if there's a guy or a girl behind me.

89
00:06:01.250 --> 00:06:03.800
Hopefully it is a go because they're not paid no deepened.

90
00:06:03.801 --> 00:06:08.300
Some wet top does a penis. I'll just use it as a pillow.

91
00:06:08.330 --> 00:06:13.220
Hopefully it ain't odd. Jacob. We're Miranda a little bit. Bose.

92
00:06:13.450 --> 00:06:16.850
I don't know if I like to put my bow. My head. Yeah.

93
00:06:16.851 --> 00:06:21.020
You didn't use one of your bows or your NAB. I swung on me. see

94
00:06:23.030 --> 00:06:26.330

95
00:06:26.450 --> 00:06:30.800
I hope you got a cause here we go. We,

96
00:06:31.340 --> 00:06:33.860
those British guys. Don't, man.

97
00:06:38.420 --> 00:06:39.890
You seen Europeans bro.
