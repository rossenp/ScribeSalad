00:00:01.380 --> 00:00:05.700
<v 0>I was at the Benjamin Franklin museum in Philly. That dude was not active. He,</v>

2
00:00:05.701 --> 00:00:10.350
although he lived to be like 84 and he was not active and he was

3
00:00:10.740 --> 00:00:12.720
in so much pain for the later part of his life.

4
00:00:13.050 --> 00:00:15.600
And he had gout because he never moved around.

5
00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:19.890
I'd like to eat cheese or whatever the Jesus. So good, dude.

6
00:00:19.891 --> 00:00:24.180
I can never be vegan because of cheese. There's no way put cheese in my casket.

7
00:00:24.181 --> 00:00:28.140
When I die. I love cheese. Don't really put it in my casket with smell bad.

8
00:00:28.141 --> 00:00:30.600
Not that I would be smelling it, but just in case you could smell when you die.

9
00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:35.250
Don't put cheese on the casket. Um, but Benjamin Franklin was,

10
00:00:35.970 --> 00:00:38.600
he invented so many things. It was insane. How,

11
00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:43.380
remember it's remember when like inventor was a job that, I mean,

12
00:00:43.381 --> 00:00:46.440
I know it's still kinda is you can still invent stuff like Elon Musk,

13
00:00:46.441 --> 00:00:50.430
but he's like the only event, like inventor where it was like, oh,

14
00:00:50.431 --> 00:00:53.370
I got to keep coming up. Like in the, in the 17 hundreds, you can be like, yeah,

15
00:00:53.371 --> 00:00:54.510
I got to come up with a new thing.

16
00:00:54.630 --> 00:00:57.960
Cause I'm an inventor because we only got like 17 things so far now everything's

17
00:00:57.961 --> 00:01:00.450
kind of been invented and you gotta like really be really smart to be an

18
00:01:00.451 --> 00:01:01.680
inventor. But back then you could have been a,

19
00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:04.200
you could have been like Michael and [inaudible] had been at an event,

20
00:01:04.410 --> 00:01:05.460
an inventor, like.

21
00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:06.151
<v 1>Yeah, you know,</v>

22
00:01:06.151 --> 00:01:09.480
this helps when you fall down and you laugh in it it's you don't fart.

23
00:01:09.690 --> 00:01:12.870
<v 0>You put it in your butt. I was like, oh, you invented the no fart plug.</v>

24
00:01:16.460 --> 00:01:19.400
You can't now get all sorts of butt plugs.

25
00:01:21.740 --> 00:01:22.573
Um,

26
00:01:24.410 --> 00:01:27.650
but did you know Ben Franklin like loved to live it up?

27
00:01:27.830 --> 00:01:31.220
He loved to hookers. Of course he did.

28
00:01:31.760 --> 00:01:34.040
When I heard that I went like this.

29
00:01:36.320 --> 00:01:38.600
Of course he did, dude. Of course,

30
00:01:38.870 --> 00:01:43.310
Ben Franklin loved to get love to Barbara. Of course,

31
00:01:43.311 --> 00:01:47.330
Ben Franklin loved to Berber when he went BRCA cat CAC. Of course he did.

32
00:01:50.300 --> 00:01:53.990
<v 1>And you know, when he got blow jobs, he would go, you know it.</v>

33
00:01:55.550 --> 00:01:59.630
<v 0>After the sandwich, I'll get it. You know, I'd love to sit in my chair.</v>

34
00:01:59.720 --> 00:02:02.630
He had a chair for sure. After the sandwich,

35
00:02:02.631 --> 00:02:06.710
I'd love to sit in my chair and just take a relaxing

36
00:02:07.760 --> 00:02:09.560
sit. I'd love to take a sit

37
00:02:12.710 --> 00:02:16.010
and they would be so disrespectful, but it wasn't disrespectful back then. Oh,

38
00:02:16.030 --> 00:02:19.670
excuse me. Could you fetch me a Milky? You know?

39
00:02:20.480 --> 00:02:24.560
And she would come by with a all out and. And he would be like,

40
00:02:24.590 --> 00:02:27.740
I'm going to sit in my chair. And while I finished this,

41
00:02:29.370 --> 00:02:32.510
you know what, I finished this bread sandwich.

42
00:02:32.540 --> 00:02:37.100
<v 1>Like he would just be this cheese bread sandwich. Would you.</v>

43
00:02:37.160 --> 00:02:40.790
<v 0>Mind if I just unloaded my sack into your trachea?</v>

44
00:02:42.260 --> 00:02:43.460
And she was like, sure,

45
00:02:44.330 --> 00:02:48.350
because I an event and he'd sit there and then she'd do it.

46
00:02:48.500 --> 00:02:52.000
And then he'd have his eat his sandwich on his belly while he was getting

47
00:02:53.630 --> 00:02:56.630
just sucked off.

48
00:02:56.870 --> 00:02:59.950
<v 2>And you would be like, oh, oh.</v>

49
00:02:59.980 --> 00:03:02.440
<v 0>That's how we would bust. And then she'd leave.</v>

50
00:03:02.441 --> 00:03:06.010
And he would like invent a visor. You know,

51
00:03:06.310 --> 00:03:08.050
this keeps you hat your.

52
00:03:08.050 --> 00:03:11.260
<v 1>Head. Cool. But still the sun out of your eyes.</v>

53
00:03:13.570 --> 00:03:17.800
<v 0>Now let me take, you know, I would love to get sucked by a Milky.</v>

54
00:03:19.570 --> 00:03:23.080
Let me undress, give me 35 minutes because I'm wearing too many things.

55
00:03:24.130 --> 00:03:27.010
You see what they wore, dude. They, they have guys in Philly,

56
00:03:27.250 --> 00:03:29.410
like in the area where all the museums are.

57
00:03:29.411 --> 00:03:33.400
They have guys still dressed like that, like for fun. And I'm just like, bro,

58
00:03:33.760 --> 00:03:37.990
it's summer. You know, why do you have seven pair of pants on and two boots

59
00:03:40.330 --> 00:03:41.920
and a fake like,

60
00:03:43.660 --> 00:03:48.070
like just an extra pouch and billowy assed pants.

61
00:03:48.100 --> 00:03:51.700
It's 85 degrees. You don't need to do that.

62
00:03:51.701 --> 00:03:53.680
Who are you doing this for the kids that don't really give a.

63
00:03:54.340 --> 00:03:56.380
You can just give them a lollipop and they'd be much happier.

64
00:04:00.180 --> 00:04:02.790
He preferred older women as lovers. Did you know that?

65
00:04:03.300 --> 00:04:06.450
And this is why I have an excerpt from what the it is.

66
00:04:07.050 --> 00:04:08.580
This is unbelievable that he wrote this.

67
00:04:08.850 --> 00:04:13.800
And it was public because if you wrote something like this you're canceled right

68
00:04:13.801 --> 00:04:18.630
now, the faced, he would have just write, Benjamin Franklin didn't give a.

69
00:04:18.960 --> 00:04:19.793
You would just write.

70
00:04:23.190 --> 00:04:25.740
This was a letter he wrote to some people you can just like be like,

71
00:04:26.550 --> 00:04:28.350
when you were in the 1700,

72
00:04:28.360 --> 00:04:30.570
you just write a letter and then just send it to a bunch of people.

73
00:04:30.571 --> 00:04:35.280
And that counted as a book. This is what he says. The face first grows,

74
00:04:35.300 --> 00:04:39.900
Lank and wrinkled. Then the neck, then the breast and arms,

75
00:04:40.230 --> 00:04:44.040
the lower parts, continuing to the last as plump as ever.

76
00:04:44.820 --> 00:04:47.430
So that covering all above with a basket.

77
00:04:47.431 --> 00:04:50.040
And regarding only what is below the girdle,

78
00:04:50.760 --> 00:04:55.470
it is simply impossible of two women to know an ode from a young

79
00:04:55.471 --> 00:04:59.640
one. And as in the dark, all cats are gray.

80
00:05:00.180 --> 00:05:04.650
The pleasure of corporal enjoyment with an old woman is at least equal and

81
00:05:04.651 --> 00:05:09.420
frequently superior. Every neck being by practice,

82
00:05:09.480 --> 00:05:10.800
capable of improvement,

83
00:05:16.170 --> 00:05:19.380
canceled, dude,

84
00:05:19.620 --> 00:05:24.420
this is the part that is the Sid, this respectful dude.

85
00:05:26.280 --> 00:05:27.113
This is the part.

86
00:05:29.160 --> 00:05:32.340
<v 1>And as in the dark,</v>

87
00:05:32.430 --> 00:05:34.770
all cats are gray.

88
00:05:36.960 --> 00:05:40.980
<v 0>Doesn't matter. And then this part, so that covering all above,</v>

89
00:05:41.010 --> 00:05:44.460
meaning above the waist with a basket. Yes,

90
00:05:48.690 --> 00:05:49.530
basically.

91
00:05:49.950 --> 00:05:54.660
He's the two live crew of his generation being like,

92
00:05:54.720 --> 00:05:58.280
yeah, put a paper bag over her face if she's and just

93
00:06:01.010 --> 00:06:01.550
empty.

94
00:06:01.550 --> 00:06:04.850
<v 1>Or sack in her. Hey Ben Franklin.</v>

95
00:06:06.860 --> 00:06:11.180
<v 0>Did. He's Ben Franklins canceled, bro. I know he discovered electricity.</v>

96
00:06:11.420 --> 00:06:13.670
Anyone invented the bifocals. You know why he invented the,

97
00:06:13.940 --> 00:06:15.580
I don't know why he invented the bifocals.

98
00:06:15.600 --> 00:06:17.720
Didn't matter what rumps we're looking like,

99
00:06:18.500 --> 00:06:20.330
all cats are great when you dim the light.

100
00:06:24.280 --> 00:06:26.740
That's just to go. That's just to show you, dude.

101
00:06:26.980 --> 00:06:29.530
It's a sign of the times and the times are always changing.

102
00:06:29.650 --> 00:06:34.330
And also the leaders are always the most insane people. Donald Trump,

103
00:06:34.360 --> 00:06:37.540
Kanye west, whoever the you want to say, they're they're always the most insane

104
00:06:39.130 --> 00:06:42.910
one. Donald Trump said. Yeah, it was nice Iran. Didn't shoot. Didn't murder.

105
00:06:42.911 --> 00:06:47.440
130 people in cold blood. That was nice to them. Hey, you're crazy.

106
00:06:48.100 --> 00:06:49.600
And that's what that's who the leaders are

107
00:06:52.750 --> 00:06:56.800
in the dark. All cats are gray talking about women. Yeah,

108
00:06:58.930 --> 00:07:02.380
sexist. Hey, put a, oh dude,

109
00:07:02.620 --> 00:07:05.410
let me write a letter to a bunch of people on counter as a book. Hey dude,

110
00:07:05.411 --> 00:07:07.750
just put a bag over her face if she's old and then her.

111
00:07:09.190 --> 00:07:12.040
<v 1>This guy was a leader.</v>

112
00:07:13.420 --> 00:07:17.500
<v 0>Wow, dude. He had talk about dad bought that guy, had a granddad bod.</v>

113
00:07:19.210 --> 00:07:23.650
So insane dude. Crazy. How times have changed.
