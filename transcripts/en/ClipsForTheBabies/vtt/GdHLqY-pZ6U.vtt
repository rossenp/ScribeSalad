1
00:00:00.150 --> 00:00:04.590
<v 0>Let's do this, dude. I'm going to tell you something right now, San Diego,</v>

2
00:00:04.620 --> 00:00:06.900
you know how I feel about you? All right.

3
00:00:07.110 --> 00:00:11.490
You know how I felt about you in the past years when I go to San Diego and I

4
00:00:11.491 --> 00:00:13.680
play the loyal con LA Jolla comedy store,

5
00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:16.640
it's always some holier than they'll like,

6
00:00:16.641 --> 00:00:18.990
guys that get drunk that think that everything's offensive.

7
00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:23.130
Even though it's filled with Republicans, it's still very weird.

8
00:00:24.930 --> 00:00:27.330
San Diego. You know, when I played the house of blues,

9
00:00:27.331 --> 00:00:30.000
I had to throw up people before I even got on stage because there were drunk

10
00:00:30.001 --> 00:00:34.620
princesses in bros luck that I have a good time know that I still get

11
00:00:34.621 --> 00:00:35.454
bags.

12
00:00:40.190 --> 00:00:41.023
<v 1>Okay.</v>

13
00:00:42.020 --> 00:00:46.940
<v 0>Didn't like it added some dates on this. Follow the leader tour for,</v>

14
00:00:48.080 --> 00:00:50.810
uh, uh, for, uh,

15
00:00:51.410 --> 00:00:55.490
San Diego put up one, sold out very quickly,

16
00:00:56.420 --> 00:00:58.160
put up another one, sold out very.

17
00:00:58.160 --> 00:01:00.590
<v 1>Quickly, put up a third one.</v>

18
00:01:00.620 --> 00:01:05.480
<v 0>Sold out. Not as quickly, but still even before the show started.</v>

19
00:01:07.010 --> 00:01:09.380
All good. Okay.

20
00:01:10.820 --> 00:01:14.120
Now I was ready. I was ready, dude.

21
00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:18.350
I was ready for some combat comedy. You know what I'm talking about?

22
00:01:18.351 --> 00:01:19.460
And I don't like combat comedy.

23
00:01:19.461 --> 00:01:22.190
A lot of people think that I do like combat comedy because I like to slam

24
00:01:22.191 --> 00:01:25.970
people. But the truth is, dude, I don't like to slam people. You understand?

25
00:01:26.660 --> 00:01:29.930
Sure. I'll open the door to, you know,

26
00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:34.430
to Dennis for anybody large or small male, female don't care. I don't even care.

27
00:01:34.431 --> 00:01:37.610
If you have disabilities, everyone gets equal slams. It doesn't matter.

28
00:01:37.670 --> 00:01:41.630
If you all feel like a person, if you're going to, you know what I mean,

29
00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:43.070
step into the octagon.

30
00:01:45.260 --> 00:01:46.093
<v 1>Now.</v>

31
00:01:46.580 --> 00:01:49.250
<v 0>You're going to get a Denny's grand slam. If you,</v>

32
00:01:49.670 --> 00:01:50.630
so I'm ready for some comeback. You.

33
00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:52.250
I don't like a lot of people think I do because I do it.

34
00:01:52.251 --> 00:01:57.080
I take it to the streets at Twitter. I take it to the streets, you know,

35
00:01:57.081 --> 00:02:00.260
on my left left factor. YouTube people are Heckerling heckling,

36
00:02:00.440 --> 00:02:03.560
and you got the videos and I'm just talking. People think I like that.

37
00:02:05.300 --> 00:02:08.240
I've weened it out over the time because I have Netflix specials in a comedy

38
00:02:08.241 --> 00:02:10.880
central spec special. And people think that now that okay,

39
00:02:11.330 --> 00:02:14.060
he's actually a legit comedian. He doesn't do all the only the clap backs,

40
00:02:14.990 --> 00:02:18.050
but then I'm ready to take it to the streets at Twitter. But I did not want to,

41
00:02:18.051 --> 00:02:21.110
I'm like one of those serious, I'm like one of those serial killers.

42
00:02:21.111 --> 00:02:25.880
That's just like, I don't want to do it. You know, but I have to. No,

43
00:02:25.910 --> 00:02:27.950
not even that like a Hitman. I don't want to do that,

44
00:02:27.951 --> 00:02:29.960
but I need to feed my family. The feeding,

45
00:02:29.961 --> 00:02:33.350
the family in this case is me showing people what's up.

46
00:02:35.240 --> 00:02:37.910
That's so most important thing for me showing people what's up.

47
00:02:38.360 --> 00:02:41.540
People say Chris, but don't be mean, but I say, but look, you need to know,

48
00:02:41.780 --> 00:02:46.670
right. They said, but Chris don't take them to the streets at Twitter.

49
00:02:46.790 --> 00:02:51.230
But I say, but he needs to know, but he didn't tag you. That's right.

50
00:02:52.040 --> 00:02:56.030
Because I searched my name, but isn't that petty? I don't think so.

51
00:02:56.450 --> 00:02:59.740
I think more of it is that he needs to know.

52
00:03:00.310 --> 00:03:03.760
You understand if this is the internet and this is what the internet is,

53
00:03:04.210 --> 00:03:07.780
then that needs to know what this internet is.

54
00:03:09.340 --> 00:03:13.680
So that's it. Okay.

55
00:03:13.980 --> 00:03:17.250
Somebody did it just right now. It's somebody tweeted something.

56
00:03:19.050 --> 00:03:21.000
I just lamps, whatever it doesn't matter, dude.

57
00:03:21.001 --> 00:03:23.970
My point is I was all ready for some combat comedy.

58
00:03:25.470 --> 00:03:29.280
First show went off without a hitch. Second show went off without a hitch.

59
00:03:29.550 --> 00:03:32.520
Third show went out. Now I throw a guy out,

60
00:03:32.550 --> 00:03:36.540
but it was still not so bad for San Diego. It was fine. Did I throw out a guy?

61
00:03:36.541 --> 00:03:38.910
Yes. Did I do it very quickly? Yes.

62
00:03:38.911 --> 00:03:42.540
Did I do it in the part of my act where the only place I could do it? Yes.

63
00:03:42.780 --> 00:03:45.060
Did the security escort him out? Yes.

64
00:03:45.180 --> 00:03:49.140
Did he throw down a trash can in the lobby when he was escorted out? Yes.

65
00:03:49.230 --> 00:03:52.350
Did he try and fight the security? Yes. Did they call the cops? Yes.

66
00:03:52.351 --> 00:03:55.890
Did the cops come? Yes. Did they put him in handcuffs? Yes.

67
00:03:55.980 --> 00:03:58.410
Did his girl try and kick the cops and then the cop slammed the girl to the

68
00:03:58.411 --> 00:03:59.244
ground.

69
00:04:00.060 --> 00:04:02.610
<v 2>There you go. Yes. But still wants it to three shots in that bag.</v>

70
00:04:02.730 --> 00:04:05.100
So San Diego I've come around, dude.

71
00:04:05.730 --> 00:04:06.563
<v 1>Hmm.</v>

72
00:04:09.390 --> 00:04:12.840
<v 2>Dude. I've come around, man. I had a good show. I had good three shows.</v>

73
00:04:12.841 --> 00:04:17.040
Now one guy that was surely stockier than he is tall and had a backwards,

74
00:04:17.670 --> 00:04:21.300
Hurley hat surely and had a flannel buttoned up all the way to his neck,

75
00:04:21.960 --> 00:04:24.840
Shirley and a girl with a CR with a body that does it. Isn't that good,

76
00:04:24.841 --> 00:04:28.050
but isn't pretty passable for not working out. Shirley

77
00:04:30.030 --> 00:04:31.200
was trying to ruin it,

78
00:04:32.670 --> 00:04:36.420
but did the cops come and do a [inaudible] and put her on the ground and cuff

79
00:04:36.540 --> 00:04:38.730
him up and put them in the drunk tech? Yes.

80
00:04:38.731 --> 00:04:42.690
So San Diego I've come around, dude,

81
00:04:42.940 --> 00:04:47.700
still to those people, but also San Diego I've come around.

82
00:04:50.130 --> 00:04:51.870
<v 0>I'm a morning. DJ. My babies.</v>

83
00:04:54.360 --> 00:04:57.240
I got a keyboard dude and I use it,

84
00:05:00.720 --> 00:05:03.480
But that's it dude. So I'm at a good time. So San Diego.

85
00:05:03.750 --> 00:05:07.350
<v 2>I stayed at the Pendry hotel. And usually when I go into.</v>

86
00:05:08.430 --> 00:05:13.080
<v 0>Uh, uh, a town, you know,</v>

87
00:05:13.110 --> 00:05:15.150
I in my head, I'm like, don't talk to me when I check in.

88
00:05:15.151 --> 00:05:17.160
I don't want people saying. I don't want to, I, you know,

89
00:05:17.161 --> 00:05:19.830
I don't like to be bothered with fans. I like them when they like me from afar,

90
00:05:19.980 --> 00:05:22.140
but I don't like them. Number one, staring, if you look at me,

91
00:05:22.710 --> 00:05:25.650
if you see what's the 50 cent sign, what's the 50 cent line,

92
00:05:28.270 --> 00:05:32.310
CBR public dance therapy, man, whatever the it is. I dunno, whatever the it is.

93
00:05:32.311 --> 00:05:33.630
I used to think that was weird, but now I get it.

94
00:05:33.840 --> 00:05:38.610
Cause I'm as famous as 50 cent. So, so I see it.

95
00:05:39.900 --> 00:05:44.700
I don't like to be doing the, but then when they S when was I saying, so

96
00:05:46.530 --> 00:05:49.740
what was I saying? Uh, then, uh, Oh yeah. So,

97
00:05:49.741 --> 00:05:54.540
but secretly I'm ready for it. Wasn't happening so much in San Diego.

98
00:05:54.541 --> 00:05:57.530
I was like, is it? Cause I'm close to LA. And it wasn't because I was to LA.

99
00:05:57.710 --> 00:06:01.310
It was because I wasn't even close to the most feminist person staying at the

100
00:06:01.311 --> 00:06:04.670
hotel because it was the San Diego international film festival.

101
00:06:04.790 --> 00:06:07.580
Now why do they call it the San Diego international film festival when it's 30

102
00:06:07.581 --> 00:06:09.830
minutes away from LA, it doesn't need to say it's international,

103
00:06:09.831 --> 00:06:13.190
even though it is international because they accept movies from all over the

104
00:06:13.191 --> 00:06:15.800
place. I get it. But don't say it to try and make your sound better.

105
00:06:15.830 --> 00:06:17.890
It doesn't matter. Is it very San Diego.

106
00:06:19.370 --> 00:06:20.203
<v 1>Gas.</v>

107
00:06:21.620 --> 00:06:25.760
<v 0>But I was in the elevator and I saw the guy from, um,</v>

108
00:06:26.990 --> 00:06:31.640
Chernobyl. And I told my dad, I saw the, the guy for the lead from Chernobyl.

109
00:06:31.641 --> 00:06:35.120
And he said, Oh, which one from Shinola? And I said, the lead. And he said,

110
00:06:35.121 --> 00:06:37.610
well, which one is that? And I said, did you see it? And he said, yes.

111
00:06:37.611 --> 00:06:40.880
So I said, well then the guy who is in it the most,

112
00:06:42.500 --> 00:06:45.020
and then he said, Oh, and they said the guy's name.

113
00:06:45.230 --> 00:06:47.900
And I didn't know what his name was. And my mom said, yeah.

114
00:06:48.820 --> 00:06:53.740
And that whole conversation is interesting because it didn't

115
00:06:53.741 --> 00:06:58.360
need to happen. Didn't stand my dad's the King of that, dude.

116
00:06:59.350 --> 00:07:03.010
Yeah. Yeah. I saw the lead at Chernobyl and the, in an elevator. Oh,

117
00:07:03.011 --> 00:07:07.510
which one's the lead? Well, you're a director and a producer in Hollywood.

118
00:07:07.510 --> 00:07:12.160
So you surely know what a lead is, right? Well, yeah, but which one was it?

119
00:07:12.400 --> 00:07:16.180
Well, did you see the show while I only saw the first three episodes. Oh, okay.

120
00:07:16.330 --> 00:07:20.290
So the guy that was in those episodes the most,

121
00:07:20.860 --> 00:07:24.850
then he said the guy's name, Jared Harris. And then I said, yes,

122
00:07:25.960 --> 00:07:29.920
conversation over. Did we need to have it? No.

123
00:07:31.660 --> 00:07:34.360
To get their together. But I do that too. Like father, like son,

124
00:07:34.361 --> 00:07:36.400
the Apple doesn't fall far from the tree and it's not my fault.

125
00:07:37.240 --> 00:07:41.980
Did his dad Vincent do it? Probably. I don't know,

126
00:07:42.460 --> 00:07:47.290
but did, my grandpa, everyone called him his name. We called him grandpa.

127
00:07:47.320 --> 00:07:49.780
Bam. Everyone called him. Bam. Because when he was a kid,

128
00:07:50.230 --> 00:07:53.050
he was skinny as a bamboo stick, but he wasn't skinny when he was older.

129
00:07:53.320 --> 00:07:57.280
So it was always confusing for me as a kid, my grandpa bam.

130
00:07:58.960 --> 00:08:00.580
Anyway, um,

131
00:08:03.310 --> 00:08:04.960
it's so

132
00:08:06.670 --> 00:08:11.590
New York in the fifth thirties to be named Vincent,

133
00:08:11.800 --> 00:08:16.510
but also go by bam. You know what I mean?

134
00:08:16.570 --> 00:08:19.180
Like that old, uh,

135
00:08:22.300 --> 00:08:23.530
uh, like the old like,

136
00:08:27.580 --> 00:08:29.890
Hey bam. Yeah. Don't call me that.

137
00:08:35.050 --> 00:08:39.010
Good. Hey bam. Yeah. And don't call me that. My name is Vincent. Nah,

138
00:08:39.160 --> 00:08:41.350
you're skinny. Like a bamboo stick. Yeah,

139
00:08:41.970 --> 00:08:45.220
but I don't want to be called bam ad doesn't matter. And it stuck

140
00:08:47.170 --> 00:08:50.500
and it kept sticking and then just a montage of him growing up. Hey,

141
00:08:50.501 --> 00:08:55.240
getting in fights and. Hey Dylan. And that's where I was.

142
00:08:55.530 --> 00:08:57.300
That's where I was everyone too.

143
00:08:59.450 --> 00:09:00.283
<v 1>Kind of grew on me.</v>

144
00:09:02.090 --> 00:09:04.550
<v 0>Then just him dealing drugs.</v>

145
00:09:10.250 --> 00:09:11.083
<v 1>[Inaudible].</v>

146
00:09:12.980 --> 00:09:17.450
<v 0>Um, so anyway, bam, my grandpa bam. So whatever the dude.</v>

147
00:09:17.451 --> 00:09:21.390
So anyway, uh, w w what I'm trying to say is, uh, uh,

148
00:09:21.430 --> 00:09:25.850
San Diego I've come around, but, uh,

149
00:09:26.450 --> 00:09:30.980
it's all good. And I was in Riverside too. Everyone always talks about, look,

150
00:09:30.981 --> 00:09:32.300
when you say you're going to Riverside,

151
00:09:32.301 --> 00:09:35.000
everyone always talks about her Riverside. They're like, Oh man,

152
00:09:35.660 --> 00:09:38.600
you stay in the night. I hope not, dude.

153
00:09:39.290 --> 00:09:43.880
It ripped. I did Riverside. I love performing in Riverside,

154
00:09:44.120 --> 00:09:47.150
stayed the night in Riverside. Okay.

155
00:09:48.170 --> 00:09:51.620
I stayed the night in Riverside, man. That's an hour and a half away.

156
00:09:52.130 --> 00:09:54.950
I stayed the night, dude, do you understand me?

157
00:09:56.480 --> 00:10:00.710
And I stayed in a hotel that was not good.

158
00:10:01.130 --> 00:10:04.820
Fine. Now did,

159
00:10:05.810 --> 00:10:09.170
by the way, there was some kind of parade in Riverside or something.

160
00:10:09.171 --> 00:10:12.980
And it really me off. I woke up, it woke me up in the morning. I heard people.

161
00:10:13.530 --> 00:10:18.490
<v 1>Ooh, Ooh, Ooh, Ooh, Ooh</v>

162
00:10:21.250 --> 00:10:22.083
[inaudible]. And then I was.

163
00:10:22.190 --> 00:10:23.930
<v 0>I was like, I was like, am I dreaming this?</v>

164
00:10:24.200 --> 00:10:27.470
And then they just heard coming closer and closer. And then I just kept.

165
00:10:27.470 --> 00:10:29.810
<v 1>Hearing boom blue. And I was like, Oh.</v>

166
00:10:30.260 --> 00:10:32.420
<v 0>Riverside, dude. It does suck, man.</v>

167
00:10:32.630 --> 00:10:36.110
But then I woke up and there was just so many,

168
00:10:36.111 --> 00:10:40.010
I don't know what parade was going on on Saturday or Friday or what was it?

169
00:10:40.011 --> 00:10:42.920
I guess it was Friday morning.

170
00:10:43.790 --> 00:10:47.150
Who the has a parade on Friday morning,

171
00:10:48.920 --> 00:10:50.870
Riverside. That was the best they could get. They were like,

172
00:10:50.871 --> 00:10:53.540
can we get a Saturday or Sunday parade? And they were like, nah, it's Riverside,

173
00:10:53.541 --> 00:10:57.950
man. Parades. They're moving. They get to San Diego and LA by,

174
00:10:58.220 --> 00:11:01.490
by Saturday and Sunday. All right, let's just do it Friday.

175
00:11:03.980 --> 00:11:06.950
And then, so they did their parade. I don't even know if there was a parade.

176
00:11:06.951 --> 00:11:10.550
I just kept waken up. By the time I woke up, woke up, it was, it was done.

177
00:11:11.180 --> 00:11:13.190
It wasn't really a PR definitely wasn't a parade though.

178
00:11:13.191 --> 00:11:15.050
It was like just people marching around and.

179
00:11:15.590 --> 00:11:18.260
But then I went outside and I got some coffee. That was good.

180
00:11:18.261 --> 00:11:19.730
And I got a breakfast sandwich. That was good.

181
00:11:19.731 --> 00:11:21.350
And it was a coffee bean and tea leaf right there.

182
00:11:21.500 --> 00:11:24.680
It was a cute little town dude. I feel like Riverside is on the come up, man.

183
00:11:25.580 --> 00:11:30.080
But at a good time in Riverside, the crowds are always good in Riverside.

184
00:11:31.910 --> 00:11:33.620
Uh, I don't know why people are always like, yeah,

185
00:11:33.650 --> 00:11:35.390
but that's because they don't have anything to do, bro.

186
00:11:35.391 --> 00:11:37.970
They look like they're doing just fine.

187
00:11:38.240 --> 00:11:42.890
Also some places that don't have anything to do their

188
00:11:42.891 --> 00:11:46.310
crowds suck like in North Battleford

189
00:11:47.690 --> 00:11:52.250
when I was in Canada and every piece of artwork was a

190
00:11:52.760 --> 00:11:54.770
tan and Aqua Marine Eagle.
