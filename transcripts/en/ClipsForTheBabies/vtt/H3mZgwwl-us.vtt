It seems like he loves being a guys guy.

12
00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:47.460
It seems like he fancies himself that way. Like, he's just like, Hey man,

13
00:00:47.461 --> 00:00:51.060
I know I'm Oscar winner, but you know me, you know me,

14
00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:54.840

17
00:01:03.990 --> 00:01:08.400

18
00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:12.780
they would try to be proven that they're the most guy he has guys,

19
00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:17.310
Jason Mamoa would be like, well, you know, I have an ax and McConaughey.

20
00:01:17.390 --> 00:01:21.330
He'd be like, yeah man, that's funny. Yeah. I have an ax too.

23
00:01:30.301 --> 00:01:34.020

24
00:01:36.480 --> 00:01:39.870
and I made, um, what was it?

25
00:01:39.871 --> 00:01:43.280
I made a bow and arrow to go hunt. Cause we,

26
00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:47.730
we eat whatever we kill. Yeah. I haven't eaten a meal.

27
00:01:48.210 --> 00:01:51.240
Store-bought man. It's been

28
00:01:53.010 --> 00:01:57.750
since the eighties and then MOAs. I, yeah, I was born.

29
00:01:57.810 --> 00:02:02.790
It was when I was born, but I don't think I've ever eaten a store-bought meal.

30
00:02:02.791 --> 00:02:05.190
Actually. I remember when I was three,

31
00:02:05.910 --> 00:02:08.940

32
00:02:11.130 --> 00:02:16.080

34
00:02:22.170 --> 00:02:26.160
know you weren't there because it's in this remote area and then he cuts him off

35
00:02:26.161 --> 00:02:28.920
his idea, that remote area in that Island that, uh,

36
00:02:30.360 --> 00:02:31.860
where we just build everything.

37
00:02:33.710 --> 00:02:36.320

00:02:53.360 --> 00:02:56.870
sharing myself and my views with the world.

42
00:02:56.930 --> 00:03:01.470

43
00:03:02.910 --> 00:03:04.270
I'd like, I know I wouldn't have a monologue.
