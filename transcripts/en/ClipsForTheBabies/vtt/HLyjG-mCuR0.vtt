1
00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:03.150
<v 0>So weird. That's so weird. Huh?</v>

2
00:00:03.750 --> 00:00:07.590
You know what it is celebrities now that they have to be in and I'm talking

3
00:00:07.591 --> 00:00:09.660
about celebrities and not comedians, by the way,

4
00:00:09.900 --> 00:00:12.930
comedians seem to have this sort of, well, some comedians are out of touch,

5
00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:17.550
but it feels like the safest thing to be online as a comedian because these

6
00:00:17.551 --> 00:00:21.570
singers and these people who are on, uh, social media,

7
00:00:22.440 --> 00:00:25.800
these actors who just like now are like, okay, let's wrap production.

8
00:00:25.801 --> 00:00:28.180
What do I do? I guess I'll just sing about fried fish in my bathroom,

9
00:00:28.210 --> 00:00:32.310
get the lighting guy. Like it's so weird.

10
00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:38.450
Uh, and also

11
00:00:40.130 --> 00:00:45.050
will lead to something like the Gaga DOE

12
00:00:45.051 --> 00:00:49.850
thing, which is just, wow, wait,

13
00:00:49.880 --> 00:00:52.760
hold on. This is the thing. Hold on. Let me go back to the I,

14
00:00:52.820 --> 00:00:54.560
what did I think I tweeted it? Yeah.

15
00:00:54.650 --> 00:00:59.000
I wrote this made me want to go to a credit gal Gadot, best of gal on Twitter.

16
00:00:59.180 --> 00:01:00.800
We are in this together. We will get through this.

17
00:01:00.890 --> 00:01:03.530
We will get through it together. Yeah. That's the I don't like. It's like, yeah.

18
00:01:03.531 --> 00:01:04.550
Except for the people that die.

19
00:01:05.300 --> 00:01:08.150
A gal Gadot just posted a video of her and her other artists who are also

20
00:01:08.510 --> 00:01:11.810
quarantined because of the COVID 19 singing imagined by John Lennon on Instagram

21
00:01:11.930 --> 00:01:14.690
or on Instagram. Yeah. So I tweeted this,

22
00:01:14.900 --> 00:01:17.390
made me want to go to a crowded dance club and kiss everyone.

23
00:01:17.930 --> 00:01:20.660
Meaning I want to get the Corona virus, but do it look at this, by the way,

24
00:01:20.810 --> 00:01:25.070
let me just go on record. Some of these celebrities. I actually, I really like,

25
00:01:25.071 --> 00:01:28.940
and not that it matters. I'm a piece of, but like a lot of these people on,

26
00:01:29.270 --> 00:01:32.630
on this, I like, I like Gaga doll. I like a lot of these people.

27
00:01:33.290 --> 00:01:36.350
James Martin is a great guy. Sarah Silverman is hilarious.

28
00:01:36.500 --> 00:01:39.500
She's the only one that seems to be on this taking the out of it. We love,

29
00:01:39.530 --> 00:01:42.560
we love, we love Sarah, but, um, yeah,

30
00:01:42.590 --> 00:01:45.740
it's just so weird that they did this and that's fine.

31
00:01:46.640 --> 00:01:48.620
It's so weird that they did that did this.

32
00:01:48.710 --> 00:01:52.910
And it's fine that it's so weird that they did this, but guys, you know,

33
00:01:53.120 --> 00:01:57.410
people are face down in ventilators and Gaga doughs. Like

34
00:01:59.270 --> 00:02:03.050
I got it. I, I got it.

35
00:02:04.400 --> 00:02:05.233
What happened?

36
00:02:05.420 --> 00:02:09.530
Your cousin died and your family is at a work now because of this pandemic,

37
00:02:12.440 --> 00:02:15.200
sit down. I got this.

38
00:02:16.790 --> 00:02:20.090
Let me call nine billionaires.

39
00:02:21.950 --> 00:02:25.370
Do we have a song for you? Hey guys, I got it.

40
00:02:27.050 --> 00:02:31.970
Chill. Get Ashley Benson on the phone. You know what I mean?

41
00:02:33.170 --> 00:02:35.690
I love Ashley Benson by the way, but it's still funny and it's okay.

42
00:02:35.691 --> 00:02:40.250
And it's weird that they did it. Okay. Um, look at this.

43
00:02:43.340 --> 00:02:44.930
<v 1>There's no heaven.</v>

44
00:02:53.270 --> 00:02:55.070
<v 0>John Lennon, dude. You know,</v>

45
00:02:55.880 --> 00:03:00.160
John Lennon is obviously he's been he's dead,

46
00:03:00.940 --> 00:03:03.280
but he still went like this own. There.

47
00:03:10.500 --> 00:03:13.350
<v 1>[Inaudible] easiest future.</v>

48
00:03:22.710 --> 00:03:26.430
Imagine, Oh, the people

49
00:03:37.320 --> 00:03:37.500
[inaudible].

50
00:03:37.500 --> 00:03:42.210
<v 0>Who's that guy, that guy sells pot. Um, dude,</v>

51
00:03:44.400 --> 00:03:47.400
why are they doing? Why are they doing? Why are they doing this?

52
00:03:47.610 --> 00:03:49.830
It's weird to be that like, dude,

53
00:03:49.831 --> 00:03:54.690
people are dying and out of work and being poor and they're going to be

54
00:03:54.691 --> 00:03:58.740
on the streets because of this. And they're just in their mansions,

55
00:03:58.800 --> 00:04:03.090
singing another song and also singing

56
00:04:03.300 --> 00:04:06.390
badly. How could you, I don't, that's the whole thing.

57
00:04:06.810 --> 00:04:11.010
This goes back to my way early on episode. I don't know what episode is on,

58
00:04:11.011 --> 00:04:12.570
but dude, if you're not a singer,

59
00:04:12.630 --> 00:04:16.560
don't stare into the camera and sing for real and posted on Instagram.

60
00:04:17.070 --> 00:04:18.300
You look like a.

61
00:04:22.860 --> 00:04:23.693
You look like a.

62
00:04:28.050 --> 00:04:30.090
These it's like, you're just at your, in, you know what you are.

63
00:04:30.091 --> 00:04:31.650
You're an Instagram thought. That's what you are.

64
00:04:31.651 --> 00:04:35.850
I don't care who you are in this who are some of these people.

65
00:04:38.430 --> 00:04:40.380
I mean, some of these people are actual singers I guess.

66
00:04:41.070 --> 00:04:43.530
And they sound like this guy.

67
00:04:47.610 --> 00:04:50.070
That sounds good. I don't, I'm an idiot. I don't know who that is.

68
00:04:50.071 --> 00:04:51.270
I'm glad to know.

69
00:04:52.620 --> 00:04:56.340
At least this guy didn't even try that guy from Narcos and game of Thrones.

70
00:04:56.970 --> 00:05:00.380
God's a handsome. Huh? Why is he wearing what Luke Perry would have worn in 92.

71
00:05:00.390 --> 00:05:04.110
I know. Um, ah,

72
00:05:05.190 --> 00:05:07.500
imagine no possessions.

73
00:05:09.120 --> 00:05:13.110
I wish they asked me to do it would have been so cool to be on the ane crowd.

74
00:05:13.170 --> 00:05:16.620
Not even joking. I probably would've done it. That's how dumb I am. I'm like,

75
00:05:16.650 --> 00:05:19.980
Oh, it probably also sounded like a good idea in there. Nah, I wouldn't have,

76
00:05:20.040 --> 00:05:22.800
I wouldn't have done it. I would have been so bummed too,

77
00:05:22.950 --> 00:05:26.340
because it would have been like Gaga DOE got in touch with me through my manager

78
00:05:26.760 --> 00:05:28.300
and she wants me to do.

79
00:05:32.580 --> 00:05:33.413
<v 1>[Inaudible]. Can we do [inaudible].</v>

80
00:05:43.920 --> 00:05:47.970
<v 0>That was a mid sentence. Ah. Yeah, dude.</v>

81
00:05:50.670 --> 00:05:55.560
Anyway. Um, how come? Uh,

82
00:05:55.920 --> 00:05:59.150
I'm in a group texts with

83
00:06:00.890 --> 00:06:04.700
Nick's worsen. When you Cummings and Joe Rogan,

84
00:06:05.730 --> 00:06:07.340
they talk about the coronavirus.

85
00:06:07.341 --> 00:06:10.100
We talked about the coronavirus so much and I sent them a picture of my kid and

86
00:06:10.101 --> 00:06:13.130
they didn't respond to it. Yes. It's all good.

87
00:06:13.131 --> 00:06:15.650
I guess we're just talking about serious stuff. It's fine. It's fine. It's fine.

88
00:06:15.651 --> 00:06:18.050
It's fine. It's fine. It's not a big deal. It's fine.

89
00:06:18.290 --> 00:06:19.700
But at least say he looks cute.

90
00:06:22.010 --> 00:06:22.843
<v 2>Um.</v>

91
00:06:25.010 --> 00:06:29.630
<v 0>Um, anyway, I can't believe this about, uh, about that. They did that.</v>

92
00:06:29.750 --> 00:06:34.730
I just celebrities left to their own devices without PR like they

93
00:06:34.731 --> 00:06:37.250
don't, they can't be with their PR people to be our people. Oh man.

94
00:06:37.251 --> 00:06:40.640
I can't imagine trying to call, but that's the thing that'll end up like yoga.

95
00:06:40.760 --> 00:06:43.430
We'll get, that'll be a positive for Gaga DOE in like two years, I'll be like,

96
00:06:43.431 --> 00:06:44.420
remember when you did that and you'd be like,

97
00:06:44.450 --> 00:06:48.620
I know it was not so maybe the best idea, but we did it, you know?

98
00:06:48.621 --> 00:06:52.160
And it was a bad idea, but there, whatever I like music. So, and we'll be like,

99
00:06:52.200 --> 00:06:56.840
ah, because she's so beautiful and a good actress.

100
00:06:57.470 --> 00:07:00.980
She really is. I think she's great. Um,

101
00:07:02.690 --> 00:07:05.210
Oh you know what? It should have been dude. Imagine.

102
00:07:06.070 --> 00:07:08.020
<v 2>The people and then</v>

103
00:07:11.860 --> 00:07:15.460
imagine people. Jeremy Renner.

104
00:07:19.870 --> 00:07:24.400
<v 0>Yeah. Dude. Jeremy Renner make one by yourself. I'm going to do one by myself.</v>

105
00:07:25.360 --> 00:07:28.600
Imagine, Oh, well how's it start? Okay.

106
00:07:28.930 --> 00:07:32.110
<v 2>Living out of poverty.</v>

107
00:07:34.060 --> 00:07:36.400
Ooh. And you can imagine the people

108
00:07:38.290 --> 00:07:41.770
on the street and without any possessions,

109
00:07:41.980 --> 00:07:45.700
you can imagine them when they're not called or ha God.

110
00:07:46.030 --> 00:07:49.570
Imagine that they were all the irregular 72 degree temperature.

111
00:07:52.060 --> 00:07:53.200
Nobody is uncomfortable

112
00:07:55.060 --> 00:07:57.310
and all of them have stuff to eat

113
00:07:59.260 --> 00:08:02.890
and no kids are dying or adults are dying.

114
00:08:03.160 --> 00:08:06.520
And most importantly, nobody is dying.

115
00:08:09.340 --> 00:08:11.350
<v 0>Dude. John.</v>

116
00:08:11.530 --> 00:08:14.080
<v 2>Travolta, what's his name? John Lennon is in his grave.</v>

117
00:08:14.500 --> 00:08:18.910
<v 0>Yes. Right now John Travolta. What the?</v>

118
00:08:19.240 --> 00:08:20.230
Life a brain tumor.

119
00:08:21.430 --> 00:08:23.470
<v 2>If I do whatever, bro.</v>

120
00:08:27.640 --> 00:08:30.640
<v 0>It's about busting and coming in second and and drinking coffee.</v>

121
00:08:33.670 --> 00:08:37.240
<v 2>Hey mom, I'm saving the world. I'm on the couch. It's all good.</v>

122
00:08:38.650 --> 00:08:39.640
Do you have any death button?

123
00:08:45.700 --> 00:08:46.960
If you're going to, are you still here?

124
00:08:48.850 --> 00:08:50.350
<v 0>My phone too far away. I think she already left.</v>

125
00:08:52.000 --> 00:08:55.210
<v 2>Okay. Can you get, I know to get her, to tell you to get Funyuns.</v>

126
00:08:55.680 --> 00:08:57.060
Can you get death a 10?

127
00:08:59.850 --> 00:09:01.860
I haven't gotten up off the couch.

128
00:09:04.110 --> 00:09:04.943
I got rash.

129
00:09:08.140 --> 00:09:12.870
We need to put a healthy amount of Def on my. It's red. Probably

130
00:09:16.200 --> 00:09:17.033
imagine.

131
00:09:18.170 --> 00:09:19.700
<v 0>Dude, I like the guy who goes, I forget who does it,</v>

132
00:09:19.701 --> 00:09:20.534
but like I liked the guy goes.

133
00:09:20.630 --> 00:09:22.460
<v 2>I imagine I'll own the paper.</v>

134
00:09:23.030 --> 00:09:26.060
<v 0>We'll try to put a rock element into it, do it. I'm rock and roll.</v>

135
00:09:26.630 --> 00:09:28.100
I'm rock and roll. Did you guys know that

136
00:09:30.410 --> 00:09:34.040
Guy put Ajax in his face? That's hilarious. What if you put Ajax in his face,

137
00:09:34.070 --> 00:09:36.950
face, it started to burn his eyes and then I just call it chill. Chill.

138
00:09:36.980 --> 00:09:37.813
I got it.

139
00:09:37.880 --> 00:09:42.800
<v 2>Imagine all the people standing by a train.</v>

140
00:09:43.820 --> 00:09:44.300
Ooh.

141
00:09:44.300 --> 00:09:47.780
<v 0>Or however ever it goes. I know zero of those words, except for the word.</v>

142
00:09:47.781 --> 00:09:48.200
Imagine.
