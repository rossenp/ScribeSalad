00:00:00.990 --> 00:00:05.610
<v 0>And, uh, my, uh, opener was there with me.</v>

2
00:00:05.760 --> 00:00:08.610
And what the was I going to tell you something about him?

3
00:00:08.611 --> 00:00:12.240
And I can't even remember at this point, God, the guy's such a little boy.

4
00:00:12.390 --> 00:00:16.380
He's the one who farted on the ground. Um,

5
00:00:17.250 --> 00:00:21.990
but, uh, it was fun.

6
00:00:21.991 --> 00:00:25.440
I brought him in over my Irish friend mark to, um,

7
00:00:26.490 --> 00:00:27.323
what do you call it?

8
00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:33.420
What does this judgmental map of Memphis? Like,

9
00:00:33.421 --> 00:00:36.390
it's like a racist judgemental or it's like, that means a real thing.

10
00:00:38.490 --> 00:00:40.950
That's a joke. Okay. Gotcha. Oh yeah. Got it.

11
00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:47.610
Um, yeah. So stay at a Memphis, I guess. I don't know, but we were there,

12
00:00:47.611 --> 00:00:51.960
we did a bus. It was the first time I was ever on a bus tour. I dad was like,

13
00:00:51.961 --> 00:00:54.780
you know what? I've always wanted to do it. It costs money,

14
00:00:54.781 --> 00:00:55.980
a lot of money to rent a bus.

15
00:00:56.160 --> 00:00:59.220
So we rented a bus and had the king bed in the back or the,

16
00:00:59.310 --> 00:01:01.890
I don't know how big or the thing was. And then we had the, um,

17
00:01:02.730 --> 00:01:07.290
the bunks for them and mark and Mike would sleep in the bunks bro.

18
00:01:07.300 --> 00:01:08.640
The first night on the bus.

19
00:01:09.470 --> 00:01:12.080
<v 1>I was like, how the do you say? Because you, what you do is you do it.</v>

20
00:01:12.550 --> 00:01:13.370
And then you drive.

21
00:01:13.370 --> 00:01:18.320
<v 0>All night on the bus to the next area. And I was like, okay, cool bands do it.</v>

22
00:01:18.321 --> 00:01:20.090
And. But I was always like, how the.

23
00:01:21.980 --> 00:01:25.850
<v 2>Did, um, I was like, how did, uh,</v>

24
00:01:27.680 --> 00:01:30.770
how do, how did you sleep when you're driving? It must be tough.

25
00:01:30.771 --> 00:01:33.590
But then I was like, I probably don't know because.

26
00:01:34.430 --> 00:01:37.400
<v 0>It's probably a lot easier than I would think with all the bumps.</v>

27
00:01:37.401 --> 00:01:37.970
It's probably not as.

28
00:01:37.970 --> 00:01:41.300
<v 1>Bumpy the first night. It's it's bumpy as.</v>

29
00:01:43.070 --> 00:01:46.640
I mean, literally you're like trying to sleep like this.

30
00:01:46.790 --> 00:01:50.420
It's like you're at ACE Ventura in that when he's driving in the thing is like

31
00:01:50.510 --> 00:01:54.440
Chitty, Chitty, bang, bang. What's that ACE Ventura two dude.

32
00:01:54.441 --> 00:01:58.280
It's it's it you're you're literally like this you're you're I was sleeping.

33
00:01:58.490 --> 00:02:00.750
My Dick was flooding. I've been all around in my abdomen.

34
00:02:01.530 --> 00:02:03.600
It was hitting each one of my six packs.

35
00:02:05.720 --> 00:02:10.370
<v 2>Just knock lamps off, dude. Um,</v>

36
00:02:11.270 --> 00:02:14.060
and uh, my Dick.

37
00:02:14.060 --> 00:02:16.730
<v 1>Flew out the window once I was like, dude, get back here, Dick.</v>

38
00:02:17.780 --> 00:02:21.750
I had to pull it in. I almost got hit by a car. No,

39
00:02:21.751 --> 00:02:25.560
but you're bouncing around like crazy gotten zeros sleep the first night.

40
00:02:28.320 --> 00:02:29.970
<v 2>Uh, and uh.</v>

41
00:02:30.490 --> 00:02:31.480
<v 1>And I was like, yeah.</v>

42
00:02:31.720 --> 00:02:36.490
Oh that I knew that what's up with all these bands doing this.

43
00:02:36.760 --> 00:02:40.120
It's too hard. Then the next night I.

44
00:02:40.600 --> 00:02:45.430
<v 0>Zonked out. I did it do it. And I slept like a baby dude. Um,</v>

45
00:02:45.670 --> 00:02:47.620
but I don't know if I'll do a bus again.

46
00:02:48.310 --> 00:02:51.640
Like it's kind of weird to be on the bus. You fall asleep.

47
00:02:51.970 --> 00:02:55.600
And then the driver gets there like while you're sleeping and then dry, like,

48
00:02:55.750 --> 00:02:59.950
I don't know this guy, you know, like I don't this driver,

49
00:03:00.400 --> 00:03:03.790
but also like this guy's just a stranger.

50
00:03:05.530 --> 00:03:08.050
That's now basically in my house.

51
00:03:08.860 --> 00:03:12.400
<v 2>While I'm sleeping and, and kidnapping.</v>

52
00:03:12.400 --> 00:03:13.690
<v 0>Me is basically what he's doing.</v>

53
00:03:14.290 --> 00:03:18.610
Like I have a stranger come in and that's when you are on a bus driving,

54
00:03:18.790 --> 00:03:21.910
you have a stranger come in and kidnap you and take you to another city.

55
00:03:22.330 --> 00:03:24.250
<v 1>Oh, and this time it was a Memphis.</v>

56
00:03:25.600 --> 00:03:26.650
<v 2>So how.</v>

57
00:03:26.650 --> 00:03:29.020
<v 0>About that dude? That's how G I am.</v>

58
00:03:29.170 --> 00:03:31.870
I had a guy while I was sleeping,

59
00:03:32.410 --> 00:03:35.650
kidnap me and take me to Memphis and I'm counting it. I'm counting it.

60
00:03:35.651 --> 00:03:37.780
Even though I set it all up, I'm counting it.

61
00:03:40.670 --> 00:03:42.620
It's like one of those places, like it's like having one of those,

62
00:03:43.070 --> 00:03:47.000
I had a kidnapped fantasy. You ever hear about rape fantasies and.

63
00:03:47.720 --> 00:03:49.370
I was talking to my buddy about,

64
00:03:49.430 --> 00:03:52.640
he was telling me that this girl had this like rape fantasy that he knew he

65
00:03:52.641 --> 00:03:56.690
never did it with her, but he was like, yeah, I want you basically.

66
00:03:56.691 --> 00:03:58.220
I tell guys it's okay.

67
00:03:58.700 --> 00:04:01.910
If I'm familiar with them to break into my house and.

68
00:04:02.380 --> 00:04:06.340
<v 3>Me. Uh, uh, uh, uh,</v>

69
00:04:07.480 --> 00:04:10.450
Hey, there, that's real. That's real.

70
00:04:10.660 --> 00:04:13.720
<v 1>How about that? That's where that sentence sense. Hey, that's real.</v>

71
00:04:14.670 --> 00:04:17.980
That's it's not a rape fantasy. That's just rate.

72
00:04:19.390 --> 00:04:20.223
Did you care?

73
00:04:21.100 --> 00:04:24.040
<v 0>Yo bro. We're cool. Yo bro. Hey, just so you know, we're cool.</v>

74
00:04:24.370 --> 00:04:27.070
So whenever you want, don't matter what I'm doing.

75
00:04:27.310 --> 00:04:31.090
Break into my house and me up. That's no matter what if your dudes two dudes.

76
00:04:32.230 --> 00:04:36.940
Wow. You know, yo, I'm a gay you're gay. Oh cool. I'll bro.

77
00:04:37.060 --> 00:04:40.870
We're cool. So whenever you want, just break into my house.

78
00:04:40.871 --> 00:04:43.630
And even if I'm screaming, no, just hit it and leave. It's all good.

79
00:04:44.500 --> 00:04:45.610
Just hit it and leave.

80
00:04:46.630 --> 00:04:48.460
<v 1>Hey, that's not a fantasy.</v>

81
00:04:49.840 --> 00:04:54.430
<v 4>That rail dude. That's more,</v>

82
00:04:54.440 --> 00:04:58.150
if you change your mind, no safe word, bro.

83
00:05:00.200 --> 00:05:01.970
<v 0>I got to pick a good say. I got to have a safe word.</v>

84
00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:03.020
Everyone should have a safe word.

85
00:05:03.080 --> 00:05:06.740
No matter what with your couple with your partner, just in case goes nuts.

86
00:05:06.770 --> 00:05:08.270
Even if you're a guy in a gross, you still have,

87
00:05:08.810 --> 00:05:13.250
you still have a safe world word. My safe word is, Hey, look over there.

88
00:05:13.251 --> 00:05:15.260
And then when they look, I choke them out and run out.

89
00:05:18.020 --> 00:05:20.750
My safe word is, oh no, they're dropping a hydrogen bomb.

90
00:05:20.751 --> 00:05:23.240
And then when they look up, I punch him in the face and run away.

91
00:05:26.830 --> 00:05:29.590
<v 1>A good, safe word is all. I'm going to all over myself and then to go.</v>

92
00:05:29.590 --> 00:05:32.920
<v 0>Into, and then when they do that, they retract and then you run away. Do it. I'm</v>

93
00:05:35.500 --> 00:05:37.990
somebody was telling me if you're going to get, uh, like a costed,

94
00:05:37.991 --> 00:05:40.360
like to just on yourself. And I'm like, dude, won't that?

95
00:05:40.361 --> 00:05:44.950
Won't they like that more dude, these people are up creepy acids.

96
00:05:45.510 --> 00:05:50.290
You on yourself. I don't even know if it's funny.

97
00:05:50.291 --> 00:05:54.460
It's so up. It's such a weird situation. But anyway,

98
00:05:54.880 --> 00:05:57.380
we did the bus. Um,

99
00:05:58.940 --> 00:06:01.790
it's a little bit weird with the bus because then people find the bus and.

100
00:06:02.210 --> 00:06:03.290
And it's like also you're just,

101
00:06:03.560 --> 00:06:08.270
some of the nights are just sleeping out on the side of the road on a bus and

102
00:06:08.271 --> 00:06:11.960
it's like, Hey, let's not, let's not in.

103
00:06:14.480 --> 00:06:18.980
<v 4>Color coat. This where homeless right now.</v>

104
00:06:19.640 --> 00:06:22.940
<v 0>We're sleeping outside. We're sleeping on a wheels. Okay.</v>

105
00:06:23.690 --> 00:06:27.770
Just because there's a lamp in this bus doesn't mean we're not homeless for

106
00:06:27.771 --> 00:06:31.370
eight hours in a Hoover, Alabama outside of the star,

107
00:06:31.371 --> 00:06:36.320
dumb comedy club next to a blockbuster that they still

108
00:06:36.321 --> 00:06:37.450
have. Cause it's Hoover. Right?

109
00:06:41.770 --> 00:06:45.530
It was cool to do the bus. Um,

110
00:06:47.350 --> 00:06:50.440
it's also cool. Cause you don't have to go to the airport a lot, whatever.

111
00:06:50.500 --> 00:06:52.600
I don't know. What am I telling you?

112
00:06:52.630 --> 00:06:54.670
Nobody in listening to this is going to get a bus, you know,

113
00:06:55.420 --> 00:06:56.050
but I'm telling you.
