1
00:00:00.240 --> 00:00:05.100
<v 0>What do we got here? Oh,</v>

2
00:00:05.700 --> 00:00:10.200
Oh, wow. Dude. Whoa.

3
00:00:10.380 --> 00:00:11.370
First of all.

4
00:00:12.770 --> 00:00:17.510
<v 1>Kenny, Chris, crystal, Leah. This is by John Lindros at true underscore baby 97.</v>

5
00:00:17.511 --> 00:00:21.230
Cool. Crisp accuracy. What do you think of the name of Kenny?

6
00:00:21.231 --> 00:00:24.800
Chesney's new tour. Okay.

7
00:00:25.010 --> 00:00:27.080
Those of you that don't know what it is.

8
00:00:29.270 --> 00:00:32.750
I'll tell you right now. It's called

9
00:00:34.400 --> 00:00:36.200
chillax suffocation.

10
00:00:38.540 --> 00:00:39.170
<v 0>Uh.</v>

11
00:00:39.170 --> 00:00:40.670
<v 1>Dude, now let me tell you something.</v>

12
00:00:43.520 --> 00:00:47.990
Tour 2020, starring Kenny Chesney course, chillax, suffocation, Florida,

13
00:00:47.991 --> 00:00:52.820
Georgia line course and old dominion and Michael Franti and spearhead.

14
00:00:54.080 --> 00:00:58.010
Dude. Let's just break that down.

15
00:00:58.790 --> 00:01:00.830
Chillax suffocation. Now

16
00:01:03.200 --> 00:01:05.090
of our frog shake, man.

17
00:01:05.630 --> 00:01:10.040
If I hear somebody say chillax,

18
00:01:14.270 --> 00:01:17.870
Quite a lunch, I'm out. I don't deal with you

19
00:01:19.460 --> 00:01:23.660
in a respectful way anymore. Unless you're like a housewife.

20
00:01:24.470 --> 00:01:26.810
Cause then I get it. You're not hip to what's hip,

21
00:01:27.470 --> 00:01:30.920
but if you're just like a dude and you say like, yeah,

22
00:01:30.921 --> 00:01:33.380
the bros are coming over to chillax a little bit.

23
00:01:35.330 --> 00:01:37.010
<v 0>Uh, you know, we're just going to chill ax.</v>

24
00:01:40.670 --> 00:01:43.850
[inaudible] all right. Okay.

25
00:01:44.660 --> 00:01:48.680
<v 1>I don't do the two words that are added into one word. I don't do the ginormous,</v>

26
00:01:48.681 --> 00:01:53.270
bro. That makes me want to move it. Fantabulous. See ya.

27
00:01:57.320 --> 00:02:02.300
Um, so chillax. No. Okay.

28
00:02:05.030 --> 00:02:08.390
If occasion, okay. That's another two words.

29
00:02:09.560 --> 00:02:14.210
That's actually maybe three words together. It's California occasion

30
00:02:16.790 --> 00:02:17.623
cation.

31
00:02:18.170 --> 00:02:21.890
So that's like vacation if chillax,

32
00:02:21.891 --> 00:02:24.880
SIF for vacation. So is,

33
00:02:24.881 --> 00:02:29.540
there's actually three letters in there that don't even need it really to make

34
00:02:29.541 --> 00:02:32.030
it, to make me stop here in Bacon's

35
00:02:33.530 --> 00:02:37.850
chillax sick cation would make me hear less bacons. Right?

36
00:02:39.140 --> 00:02:40.520
But [inaudible], it's, that's

37
00:02:40.520 --> 00:02:40.520
 like saying like, you know, doing the thing where it's like, when people think that it's funny to say breast 

38
00:02:40.520 --> 00:02:40.520
diseases

39
00:02:40.520 --> 00:02:40.520
 still, even though David Alan Grier made that funny and 1943. And then it was funny for about 10 years because David, Alan Grier did it. 

40
00:02:40.520 --> 00:02:40.520
So

41
00:02:40.520 --> 00:02:40.520
 stop doing it now. But chillax suffocation is then forwards together, but they all multiply each other. So let's put it this way. It's not forwards. It's four times four or some. So 

42
00:02:40.520 --> 00:02:40.520
that's 16% of how many 16 times how many beckons I'm hearing promoted by sponsor

43
00:02:40.520 --> 00:02:40.520
 blue chair Bay, which I don't even know what it is. Dude. Kenny Chesney, for real, this is something I know bought an Island. How he 

44
00:02:40.520 --> 00:02:40.520
must

45
00:02:40.520 --> 00:02:40.520
, first of all, he must be so rich. Let's look at his net worth right here. Even though this is so wrong, you 

46
00:02:40.520 --> 00:02:40.520
could

47
00:02:40.520 --> 00:02:40.520
 look up any celebrities, net worth, and it's mostly wrong, but it's still something I go by 

48
00:02:40.520 --> 00:02:41.353
because the internet said it net worth net worth

49
00:03:56.250 --> 00:04:00.540
190 million. And he's probably my age. Right?

50
00:04:01.560 --> 00:04:06.480
Who is the richest country singer in the world? Toby Keith 500 million. Yep.

51
00:04:06.540 --> 00:04:07.410
Dude, bro.

52
00:04:07.950 --> 00:04:11.940
500 million for singing about your dog.

53
00:04:12.420 --> 00:04:17.400
You know what I mean? Dolly Parton 400 Shania Twain, 350 million.

54
00:04:17.550 --> 00:04:22.140
Honestly, that doesn't impress me much. George Strait,

55
00:04:22.710 --> 00:04:26.310
300 million Kenny Rogers,

56
00:04:26.311 --> 00:04:31.280
250 million Taylor Swift. Well, okay. 200 million Garth Brooks, 150,

57
00:04:32.250 --> 00:04:32.701
50 million Johnny Cash.

58
00:04:32.701 --> 00:04:36.570
120 million while I know there's a problem there because he's not spending any

59
00:04:36.571 --> 00:04:40.530
of it right now. Um, Garth Brooks. Wow.

60
00:04:40.560 --> 00:04:42.900
Garth Brooks is not the

61
00:04:50.100 --> 00:04:54.690
Toby Keith and I don't even know if Toby Keith walked through the door.

62
00:04:55.200 --> 00:04:59.490
I would straight up be like, Hey man, can I help you? I wouldn't know who he is.

63
00:05:00.330 --> 00:05:02.910
Toby Keith let's look him up

64
00:05:04.590 --> 00:05:08.460
until the Keith Morrison. Toby Keith bro.

65
00:05:09.210 --> 00:05:13.940
Let's look him up $500 million. Yeah. If this guy walked through the door,

66
00:05:14.120 --> 00:05:16.410
wouldn't know he was wow.

67
00:05:16.411 --> 00:05:20.190
He looks severely different in all of these Google images.

68
00:05:22.530 --> 00:05:26.130
Whoa, is this guy shapeshifter I mean,

69
00:05:31.100 --> 00:05:32.640
God, this guy's wide. Huh?

70
00:05:35.790 --> 00:05:38.400
He literally is so white. It looks like

71
00:05:40.500 --> 00:05:43.710
somebody would be like, yeah, my friend's a black guy. And he would be like a,

72
00:05:43.711 --> 00:05:47.400
what? Maybe like a black guy. And he goes like this, sorry, I don't follow.

73
00:05:49.120 --> 00:05:51.300
Maybe be like, what do you mean? You're like, what are you talking about?

74
00:05:53.100 --> 00:05:55.830
He says, Oh my buddy's a black guy. And he would be like, yeah, no,

75
00:05:55.831 --> 00:05:58.370
I know what you're saying, but I can't what you're saying. What do you mean?

76
00:05:58.730 --> 00:06:02.660
He was like, we know he's like, uh, he's like African-American descent.

77
00:06:02.661 --> 00:06:07.520
Like he's uh, he says, and then Toby, Keith would say what?

78
00:06:08.870 --> 00:06:12.700
And he'd say, I'm sorry. I don't know what you don't get. He says, well,

79
00:06:12.701 --> 00:06:16.340
what are you saying? You're saying, he says, well,

80
00:06:16.341 --> 00:06:18.920
you know how you're white and Toby Keith would be like, wow. Yeah, you,

81
00:06:19.130 --> 00:06:22.490
God right. I'm white. And he'd be like, Whoa, dude, chill. Yeah, no,

82
00:06:22.491 --> 00:06:25.100
I understand. And I'm white as well. And he was like, of course you are.

83
00:06:25.880 --> 00:06:29.450
And then he'd be like, okay, well my friend is not white. And then Toby,

84
00:06:29.480 --> 00:06:30.980
Keith looks like he would, when, when,

85
00:06:31.010 --> 00:06:33.980
after that point that Toby kids would laugh for four straight minutes.

86
00:06:34.580 --> 00:06:35.990
And then he would be like, ah,

87
00:06:36.170 --> 00:06:39.080
wiping tears away from his cowboy eyes and just be like.

88
00:06:40.990 --> 00:06:41.920
<v 2>Oh, ah.</v>

89
00:06:43.690 --> 00:06:48.370
<v 1>And then he would say like, well, what is, what is he?</v>

90
00:06:48.550 --> 00:06:50.890
And he says, this was saying he's black. And he's like, like a black,

91
00:06:51.040 --> 00:06:54.730
like he's the color. He was like, well, he's kind of brownish actually.

92
00:06:54.731 --> 00:06:58.840
You know, it'd be like, so he's a Brown guy. And he'd be like, no. And he said,

93
00:06:58.900 --> 00:07:00.610
have you ever seen somebody not white?

94
00:07:00.611 --> 00:07:04.210
And until we give them left for six more minutes and, and cry, laughing,

95
00:07:04.600 --> 00:07:05.433
and then focus our way.

96
00:07:06.790 --> 00:07:08.500
<v 2>Yeah. What are you talking about, man?</v>

97
00:07:08.501 --> 00:07:09.550
And then he would just put a star being like

98
00:07:14.050 --> 00:07:18.370
[inaudible] my dog and my house. They only get him to deal with it.

99
00:07:18.460 --> 00:07:21.100
Then with him playing the radio dude.

100
00:07:21.310 --> 00:07:24.820
<v 1>Country songs, love singing about playing the radio. It's unreal.</v>

101
00:07:24.821 --> 00:07:25.900
How many countries songs are live.

102
00:07:26.420 --> 00:07:31.330
<v 2>Radio on skip it, bro. You're like a chick eating sushi,</v>

103
00:07:31.331 --> 00:07:33.910
talking about sushi. See ya. You're boring.

104
00:07:34.120 --> 00:07:36.850
They'll talk about the thing you're doing. Talking about some elsewhere.

105
00:07:36.851 --> 00:07:37.900
You're doing the thing this way.

106
00:07:37.901 --> 00:07:42.430
You cover more ground and you can have a personality, every country singer.

107
00:07:42.431 --> 00:07:45.850
Just like we turned the radio on sitting back. Yeah,

108
00:07:47.020 --> 00:07:51.010
top down. And we're rolling through the freeway. 91.

109
00:07:51.040 --> 00:07:55.900
Don't just name freeways And the breeze fields.

110
00:07:55.990 --> 00:07:58.630
I don't give a how the breeze feels. The breeze feels how the.

111
00:07:58.630 --> 00:07:59.463
<v 1>Breeze fields.</v>

112
00:08:01.090 --> 00:08:05.080
<v 2>Clouds coming, Brown brick and Brown, Brown, Brown, Brown, Brown, bro.</v>

113
00:08:05.200 --> 00:08:06.820
I'd much rather listen to something like

114
00:08:14.260 --> 00:08:17.290
[inaudible] it's runny crews, Brown

115
00:08:18.950 --> 00:08:20.680
[inaudible] Oh.

116
00:08:23.170 --> 00:08:25.390
That is the compared to that. They don't even know when they're getting,

117
00:08:25.480 --> 00:08:28.630
when they're getting a note to Alexa for vacation is what we're doing.

118
00:08:28.631 --> 00:08:31.600
A Marlin getting my private jet.

119
00:08:31.840 --> 00:08:35.320
And it's sponsored by blue chair Bay and Florida,

120
00:08:35.321 --> 00:08:36.730
Georgia line going to be there.

121
00:08:36.790 --> 00:08:41.710
And there will literally be nobody in this concert fan

122
00:08:41.711 --> 00:08:45.040
or artists. That's not wearing a tank top

123
00:08:46.600 --> 00:08:48.790
and shorts with cargo pants on.

124
00:08:48.791 --> 00:08:51.700
Even though shot to never have cargo pants.

125
00:08:52.420 --> 00:08:56.100
I never have cargo pockets because are shorts and.

126
00:08:56.100 --> 00:08:59.280
<v 0>Pants. I don't need a package.</v>

127
00:08:59.760 --> 00:09:02.970
Cause they only need it's like what do you want fabric?

128
00:09:02.971 --> 00:09:07.920
And not don't just take the fabric off the shins and then put more fabric

129
00:09:07.921 --> 00:09:10.470
above your knee. They create a pocket.

130
00:09:12.520 --> 00:09:13.353
<v 1>[Inaudible]</v>

131
00:09:14.840 --> 00:09:19.130
if Toby Keith walked into a for real Popeye's chicken, he would be like.

132
00:09:20.240 --> 00:09:23.000
<v 0>What's going on, man? What the?</v>

133
00:09:24.980 --> 00:09:26.990
What is going on?

134
00:09:30.620 --> 00:09:33.380
Oh my God. Are you kidding me?

135
00:09:34.880 --> 00:09:36.500

00:10:02.541 --> 00:10:05.420
And Toby kid would drive through his driveway drive through and he'd be like.

00:10:06.950 --> 00:10:10.310
<v 0>Man, pull over for a second. Roll down these windows.</v>

144
00:10:13.150 --> 00:10:17.360
Oh, Whoa. Look at this man. You see that thing next to that?

145
00:10:17.361 --> 00:10:22.250
Frilly donkey. But that's hanging right there. The pinata, sir.

146
00:10:25.070 --> 00:10:29.930
What is the pin? Jada? The pin.

00:10:32.330 --> 00:10:35.360
I'm talking about the frilly donkey. They're the colorful one.

Okay. Like a regular person.
