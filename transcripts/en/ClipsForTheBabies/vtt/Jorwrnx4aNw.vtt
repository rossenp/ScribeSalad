00:00:02.820 --> 00:00:06.450
<v 1>You know how sometimes you get the wrong sent to your house from someone else?</v>

2
00:00:07.950 --> 00:00:12.780
Well, that happened. I got sent the wrong thing.

3
00:00:13.350 --> 00:00:18.330
I hate when I get the someone else's mail, dude. Guess what? I have a thing.

4
00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:22.950
If, if, uh, if you get my mail at your house,

5
00:00:25.290 --> 00:00:29.340
that's your mail. That's your mail. Now, if it's a gift,

6
00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:35.340
you're welcome. If it's a bill, pay that. Okay. That's how we do it.

7
00:00:35.690 --> 00:00:38.720
<v 2>The postal service works the way it works.</v>

8
00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:42.890
And if you mail something somewhere else, that's the end of it. Dude.

9
00:00:43.550 --> 00:00:47.690
That's what's happened to every single time.

10
00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:49.820
I've gotten a jury duty letter.

11
00:00:53.690 --> 00:00:56.750
Never saw it. I mean, I don't even know if I've gotten it.

12
00:00:57.260 --> 00:01:01.700
I don't even know if they know I exist the court because every time

13
00:01:03.890 --> 00:01:07.160
the post office has sent me

14
00:01:08.630 --> 00:01:09.530
jury duty,

15
00:01:10.010 --> 00:01:14.840
I guess it's been lost because I've never seen

16
00:01:14.841 --> 00:01:19.670
one. All right.

17
00:01:20.300 --> 00:01:25.130
It's not that I've gotten it, seen it and thought, Oh, I'm not going

18
00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:31.430
because I'm a good guy. It's that?

19
00:01:31.431 --> 00:01:36.320
I've never gotten a jury duty notice. And that's the truth.

20
00:01:36.980 --> 00:01:40.130
I'll put my hand on the, on the Bible.

21
00:01:41.360 --> 00:01:44.360
And I'll say that to a police officer.

22
00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:50.300
All right. Shall I hope that person goes to the,

23
00:01:50.480 --> 00:01:54.140
be the juror for me? All right.

24
00:01:54.560 --> 00:01:58.220
I hope that person sits in the juror's box for me and goes like this guilty,

25
00:01:58.370 --> 00:01:59.540
not guilty. I listen.

26
00:02:00.020 --> 00:02:03.830
<v 1>Dude. Imagine me in a jury box. I swear to God, first of all,</v>

27
00:02:03.831 --> 00:02:06.380
they would never pick me. They'd be like.

28
00:02:07.490 --> 00:02:09.530
<v 2>So have you ever had any run ins with the law?</v>

29
00:02:09.560 --> 00:02:12.050
<v 1>And I'd be like, Oh, well I hope I know, but I can't wait. Well, you know,</v>

30
00:02:12.051 --> 00:02:16.340
one time I they'd be like, you know, what were your two guns blazing? All right.

31
00:02:16.341 --> 00:02:17.174
You're out.

32
00:02:17.480 --> 00:02:18.100

34
00:02:21.260 --> 00:02:22.760
<v 1>In a rip t-shirt.</v>

35
00:02:23.240 --> 00:02:25.910
<v 2>You didn't even wear the right attire. Why don't want to be here, man?</v>

36
00:02:27.870 --> 00:02:28.703
What the?

37
00:02:29.360 --> 00:02:32.360
<v 1>Me? And then they got to get a juror, jury, jury duty for me.</v>

38
00:02:32.450 --> 00:02:33.380
And it's the guy that got my.

<v 2>Oh, so this is the guy. This is.</v>

41
00:02:41.420 --> 00:02:45.100

42
00:02:45.101 --> 00:02:49.670
in any of the realm of possibility of, okay. Yeah.

43
00:02:49.671 --> 00:02:51.500
We'd like to pick Mr. Uh Dalea.

44
00:02:53.210 --> 00:02:54.860
<v 2>I would be in the jury box. I dude,</v>

45
00:02:54.890 --> 00:02:59.830
I would roll my eyes so much that it would be allow I do it so hard

46
00:02:59.831 --> 00:03:00.100
that it.

47
00:03:00.100 --> 00:03:00.933
<v 1>Would be loud.</v>

48
00:03:01.270 --> 00:03:04.090
<v 2>You'd hear me. You you'd be like, okay.</v>

49
00:03:04.091 --> 00:03:08.530
And so they'd be like doing the cross-examination. So you're saying Mr. Plumber,

50
00:03:08.560 --> 00:03:12.580
that when you were in the parking lot, there were trees in the way.

51
00:03:12.760 --> 00:03:13.500
That's what you mean.

52
00:03:13.500 --> 00:03:15.810
<v 1>We're saying between, uh,</v>

53
00:03:16.350 --> 00:03:20.100
the so-called victim and yourself and the guy would be like,

54
00:03:20.130 --> 00:03:22.710
that's what I'm saying. And then you hear me in the back. Just be like, Oh,

55
00:03:22.711 --> 00:03:27.180
come on, dude. Like really? Come on, sir.

56
00:03:27.300 --> 00:03:30.390
What do they even do? Have a juror acts up. Did they stop it? All right.

57
00:03:30.510 --> 00:03:34.290
All right. Well, he's being a Dick.

58
00:03:34.291 --> 00:03:35.910
That would be me from the germs box.

59
00:03:36.270 --> 00:03:38.670
And everyone here knows it because we talk about it behind them.

60
00:03:38.671 --> 00:03:39.570
When we take a recess,

61
00:03:39.870 --> 00:03:42.900
we talk about it in the jury room or whatever the it's called back there behind

62
00:03:42.901 --> 00:03:45.960
you judge. We talk about it. And even the Baylor shot me.

63
00:03:45.961 --> 00:03:49.440
A bailiff shot me a look, look, bailiff, or the female.

64
00:03:49.441 --> 00:03:53.790
What do you call a female bailiff. Bailiff at the Baylor fat gave me a look.

65
00:03:54.690 --> 00:03:57.180
So you do the math, but I don't think he did it.

66
00:03:59.520 --> 00:04:03.150
Can I get it like a pizza or something? I'm so hungry.

67
00:04:03.151 --> 00:04:04.800
You guys make meat at the wrong times.

68
00:04:07.440 --> 00:04:11.100
<v 2>Dude. Why lunch? Lunch at 1130. Really?</v>

69
00:04:12.810 --> 00:04:16.170
I eat at 10 30, three 39.

70
00:04:16.230 --> 00:04:19.500
<v 1>And 1:00 AM. And you make me up my whole schedule, dude,</v>

71
00:04:20.390 --> 00:04:25.080
because some guys stole a [inaudible] some money from a gas station anyway. Um,

72
00:04:26.400 --> 00:04:31.320
so I, Oh yeah, if you get my mail,

73
00:04:32.730 --> 00:04:37.440
that's it. If it's a gift, it's yours. If you, if it's a bill,

74
00:04:37.710 --> 00:04:39.570
pay that. Okay.

75
00:04:40.980 --> 00:04:45.000
Now I get mail. Most of the time it's mine.

76
00:04:45.001 --> 00:04:48.000
Sometimes I get mail and it's someone else's and

77
00:04:49.740 --> 00:04:53.310
dude, I don't give it back to the person that mine. Okay.

78
00:04:54.510 --> 00:04:59.010
If it's something like, okay, wow, this person really needs to get it. Okay.

79
00:04:59.250 --> 00:05:03.030
I'll I'll Uber send it to somebody. But dude,

80
00:05:03.360 --> 00:05:06.210
even if it's seven houses over, like I got to walk down here. Now they up.

81
00:05:06.240 --> 00:05:09.990
That's the game, dude. The mail is mine now. Okay.

82
00:05:10.530 --> 00:05:14.310
Thanks for these, you know, shorts or whatever the people mail each other.

83
00:05:16.590 --> 00:05:20.220
Guess what? I got, dude, I got cookies.

84
00:05:22.470 --> 00:05:26.790
I got cookies. I got cookies from a friend to another friend.

85
00:05:28.560 --> 00:05:30.570
And they showed up on my, on my thing.

86
00:05:31.290 --> 00:05:34.950
Not only was it the wrong mail because I know the name by the way, dude.

87
00:05:35.550 --> 00:05:37.950
I'm not going to tell. I'm not going to tell you who it was,

88
00:05:38.370 --> 00:05:40.680
but it was a huge celebrity.

89
00:05:42.450 --> 00:05:47.430
And they got their cookies from a friend that was giving them cookies for

90
00:05:47.431 --> 00:05:50.130
a nice, Hey, you know, just thinking of you

91
00:05:53.880 --> 00:05:57.830
On, I got it on my doorstep. It had the huge celebrities name on way,

92
00:05:57.831 --> 00:06:01.850
bigger than me dude. And, and, and it,

93
00:06:01.910 --> 00:06:03.410
and it wasn't delivered to the wrong place.

94
00:06:03.440 --> 00:06:05.870
It was delivered to the right place because they had my address on it.

95
00:06:06.050 --> 00:06:09.950
So you up cookie maker. So guess, guess what, dude, I ate the cookies.

96
00:06:10.490 --> 00:06:12.620
I ate the cookies, ate that big celebrities cookies.

97
00:06:13.250 --> 00:06:14.570
There were so many of them and I ate them all.

98
00:06:15.830 --> 00:06:19.220
Sometimes I ate half of them and ate another half and was watching the Sopranos.

99
00:06:19.250 --> 00:06:22.550
And I threw away the rest of the two because honestly, because I forgot,

100
00:06:22.551 --> 00:06:24.860
I had them after three weeks and they're a little bit stale, but I ate them,

101
00:06:24.861 --> 00:06:26.030
do it and I didn't give them back.

102
00:06:26.150 --> 00:06:29.630
And that celebrity is not going to get those cookies. Okay.

103
00:06:31.910 --> 00:06:35.630
Cause that's the game, dude. That's the game. If you miss,

104
00:06:36.110 --> 00:06:40.700
if you send cookies to the wrong, uh, my, my girl, she's like,

105
00:06:40.701 --> 00:06:43.910
we're going to make scones now for the person.

106
00:06:44.420 --> 00:06:48.860
So now we've got to give scones to the celebrity.

107
00:06:48.861 --> 00:06:53.210
I got to show up, imagine the celebrity, not knowing.

108
00:06:53.300 --> 00:06:57.920
Just also imagine the other person, like what the we told my dad about it.

109
00:06:57.921 --> 00:07:01.010
And he was like, yeah, you don't do that. He was like, well,

110
00:07:01.011 --> 00:07:03.440
what kind of guy did I raise? And I was like a cookie eater.

111
00:07:03.441 --> 00:07:05.660
I'll tell you that much, dude, the mail.

112
00:07:09.130 --> 00:07:12.520
So I ate the cookies and they were pretty good. And thank you. Um,

113
00:07:12.550 --> 00:07:16.330
I'll have to find out who sent it. I, I, um, I still have the note.

114
00:07:17.110 --> 00:07:19.510
It was a beautiful note. I read it. I read the note and I,

115
00:07:19.630 --> 00:07:24.610
and I ate the cookies and uh, they're mine and it's fine.

116
00:07:24.611 --> 00:07:25.660
And it's going to be fine.

117
00:07:25.661 --> 00:07:27.430
And that person who sent the cookies would probably like,

118
00:07:27.431 --> 00:07:31.960
I wonder if that celebrity got the cookies and that person has no idea

119
00:07:32.320 --> 00:07:34.330
that the cookies, if we can, did you ever get my cookie that you know,

120
00:07:34.331 --> 00:07:36.070
that I'm sure that didn't happen yet because it's not,

121
00:07:36.071 --> 00:07:39.610
it hasn't been long enough. Uh, and they have no idea that crystally,

122
00:07:39.620 --> 00:07:42.820
the comedian sat in his living room, watching the Sopranos,

123
00:07:42.850 --> 00:07:45.160

And there's also a cookie called the chocolate chip cookie.
