00:00:01.260 --> 00:00:05.190
<v 0>That remember I was talking about house people that live in other people's</v>

2
00:00:05.191 --> 00:00:09.300
houses and don't know they're talking about the five top five scariest stopped,

3
00:00:09.330 --> 00:00:13.080
top five scariest, scariest things caught on a GoPro camera.

4
00:00:14.010 --> 00:00:17.340
And I was talking to my friend

5
00:00:19.110 --> 00:00:23.970
and she was saying that she had a friend

6
00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:27.690
in Chicago that was,

7
00:00:29.370 --> 00:00:33.090
um, on, that was,

8
00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:37.800
that was there in, in the, in the S she moved in,

9
00:00:37.801 --> 00:00:41.400
I guess, in the summer. And she kept hearing like rats in the attic.

10
00:00:41.880 --> 00:00:45.690
And then when it was cold out, there was still shuffling around. She was like,

11
00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:50.250
I got to call somebody. She called the called the, uh,

12
00:00:50.310 --> 00:00:55.260
police or somebody, or like the fireman or something like something's up there,

13
00:00:56.070 --> 00:00:59.970
you know, some animals up there they're like animal control or something.

14
00:01:00.400 --> 00:01:02.970
I'm like, well, why don't you try and go up there and look around. She was like,

15
00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:07.140
Oh fine. So she put a selfie stick on the, put a, uh, an, uh,

16
00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:10.140
a phone on the selfie stick to go take the picture,

17
00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:14.670
took a few shots up in the attic and

18
00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:17.640
brought the phone down and looked.

19
00:01:17.760 --> 00:01:21.270
And there was a guy in the attic

20
00:01:29.480 --> 00:01:30.313
dude.

21
00:01:31.670 --> 00:01:34.730
There was a guy,

22
00:01:35.930 --> 00:01:40.400
a man in the attic. Yeah.

23
00:01:40.401 --> 00:01:44.210
We show we'll show the picture on the video podcast.

24
00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:45.410
We maybe blur out the guy's face.

25
00:01:45.411 --> 00:01:47.680
Apparently it was just some homeless guy that was like doing, he was like,

26
00:01:47.810 --> 00:01:51.950
the cops came and was like, yeah, no, he does this. Oh, well how about keep him?

27
00:01:55.160 --> 00:01:58.100
Yeah, I know he does this every time we let them out. Oh, really?

28
00:01:59.020 --> 00:02:03.200
Keep him hold that guy.

29
00:02:04.130 --> 00:02:08.300
Do you have cells put him in there?

30
00:02:08.930 --> 00:02:12.350
Put them in the attic of the cop place of the prison.

31
00:02:14.360 --> 00:02:19.220
I mean, so insane. Just

32
00:02:21.320 --> 00:02:25.040
know what I would do squirt everywhere. If that happened to me,

33
00:02:26.060 --> 00:02:29.900
I go like this. First of all, I go like this to the people. You want me to what?

34
00:02:30.800 --> 00:02:32.930
Go up there and Snoop around. Hmm.

35
00:02:33.890 --> 00:02:37.550
You must have me confused with Jason Statham.

36
00:02:39.380 --> 00:02:42.950
What's your second option. This is what I do. They go like this. Well,

37
00:02:42.951 --> 00:02:46.010
maybe you want to go up there. And I say, huh,

38
00:02:46.610 --> 00:02:51.110
what's your second option. And they say, selfie stick with a cell phone.

39
00:02:51.111 --> 00:02:55.730
And I go like this, convince me. And then they,

40
00:02:55.731 --> 00:02:58.520
after they convinced me for a while, I go like, okay. And I do it.

41
00:02:58.521 --> 00:03:00.730
And I take a few pictures. I bring the phone down.

42
00:03:00.760 --> 00:03:05.170
And if I see the picture that the person showed me the other night of the guy

43
00:03:05.650 --> 00:03:08.800
in the attic, that's when I release my bowels.

44
00:03:09.580 --> 00:03:12.280
That's when I all over my Yeezys,

45
00:03:14.140 --> 00:03:18.190
I go like this, I go like this. And then I bring the foam down, look at it.

46
00:03:18.250 --> 00:03:22.740
And I say, I got to get new Yeezys. That's what I say immediately. Ah.

47
00:03:23.130 --> 00:03:26.910
I got to get new Yeezys. And then I go, ah, and run out.

48
00:03:28.320 --> 00:03:32.220
I don't get scared first. Oh,

49
00:03:32.221 --> 00:03:35.430
my Jordans are Brown. Ah, and run away.

50
00:03:42.720 --> 00:03:45.720
I go, Hey, when you get, Oh, Hey, when you get out of this attic,

51
00:03:45.721 --> 00:03:49.080
you're going to have to watch her watch out. Or you gonna slip.

52
00:03:52.590 --> 00:03:56.190
I should all the way down my stairs, down my stairs to the first level.

53
00:03:56.191 --> 00:04:00.330
And then down to my driveway, I got all in my Aston Martin.

54
00:04:00.360 --> 00:04:01.980
That's what I got my babies.

55
00:04:02.550 --> 00:04:04.500
And I drove all the way to the police station and I all over there.
