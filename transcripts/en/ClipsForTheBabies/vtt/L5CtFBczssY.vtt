00:01:23.481 --> 00:01:25.090
They're going to be stealing viruses, dude.

23
00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:32.150
That's like that movie planet of the apes dude

24
00:01:35.110 --> 00:01:39.530

25
00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:42.740
God dude. Monkey stole a virus

26
00:01:44.570 --> 00:01:48.470

27
00:01:49.220 --> 00:01:52.460
Monkey steel virus.

28
00:01:54.020 --> 00:01:56.060
And they're just chilling. There's a picture of a monkey chilling with a vial,

29
00:01:56.061 --> 00:02:00.650
just like this. Killing, kidding monkey steals.

30
00:02:00.651 --> 00:02:04.760
COVID-19 test samples from health worker in India.

31
00:02:05.150 --> 00:02:07.880
Hey dude, I have a question.

32
00:02:08.660 --> 00:02:12.650
Why are monkeys remotely close to that?

33
00:02:14.660 --> 00:02:16.310
Hey, Hey,

34
00:02:16.340 --> 00:02:20.990

35
00:02:21.620 --> 00:02:25.520
and that's obvious. Oh it. Monkey with a vial.

36
00:02:25.521 --> 00:02:28.820

00:02:37.490 --> 00:02:40.220
Why were you even close to that? Yeah. I don't know. Indians are nuts, man.

40
00:02:40.460 --> 00:02:43.850
They'll put monkeys near the viruses nearby vials. Monkey.

41
00:02:43.851 --> 00:02:45.890
Shouldn't I have a monkey and I don't I'll say it.

42
00:02:47.240 --> 00:02:51.110
We shouldn't even be near a glass period. This vial right here, glass.

43
00:02:51.470 --> 00:02:55.700
I got it from a Indian guy. Really?

44
00:02:55.880 --> 00:02:58.610
What are you gonna do with it? You think? I know I'm a monkey.

45
00:02:59.170 --> 00:03:03.760
I might throw it or eat it or try and put it in my. I'm a monkey.

46
00:03:03.761 --> 00:03:07.450
Who knows what I'm going to do with it? I shouldn't even be talking right now.

47
00:03:09.280 --> 00:03:13.960
Monkeys mobbed, an Indian health worker and made off with bloods. Dude.

48
00:03:14.020 --> 00:03:16.060
What is this world?

49
00:03:16.480 --> 00:03:20.320
Monkeys mobbed in Indian health worker and made off with blood samples from

50
00:03:20.321 --> 00:03:22.150
coronavirus tests, prompting fears.

51
00:03:22.151 --> 00:03:23.800
They could have spread the virus in the local area.

52
00:03:24.070 --> 00:03:26.740
After making off with the three samples,

53
00:03:27.280 --> 00:03:30.880
they took three dude. They took one.

54
00:03:30.881 --> 00:03:35.650
And then either this is how this went. One took one and then,

55
00:03:35.980 --> 00:03:39.070
Oh, not done yet. Took another one. And then he goes, you thought that was it?

56
00:03:39.250 --> 00:03:40.270
And took a third one.

57
00:03:40.480 --> 00:03:45.250
Either that happened or three monkeys took one eight inch.

58
00:03:46.720 --> 00:03:51.460
That's Hey, get rid of monkeys. Hey monkeys. You had your day.

59
00:03:51.550 --> 00:03:56.440
Great tired of y'all swinging around stealing viral, viral vials. You're out,

60
00:03:56.441 --> 00:04:01.060
dude. You go, go, go, go. Either. I tell you what this is.

61
00:04:01.061 --> 00:04:05.710
It either get rid of all the monkeys or dress them up like people and then just

62
00:04:05.711 --> 00:04:10.030
have them out because the reason I'm not doing this, uh, wait, hold on.

63
00:04:10.990 --> 00:04:13.990
There's a monkey out. What? What's the deal here? I'm either.

64
00:04:14.020 --> 00:04:17.710
The monkey is going to be us or

65
00:04:18.520 --> 00:04:22.750
done. I'm no I'm talking about kill them. All kill all the monkeys.

66
00:04:23.530 --> 00:04:26.590
There's going to be no gray area here.

67
00:04:27.100 --> 00:04:28.810
If a monkey could steal a vile,

68
00:04:30.250 --> 00:04:33.430
either murder all the monkeys or give them driver's licenses, dude.

69
00:04:33.431 --> 00:04:36.970
And I'm not around. Give them all hats and caps and over. I don't give a.

70
00:04:37.660 --> 00:04:39.310
Clothe them. If they're around naked,

71
00:04:39.340 --> 00:04:41.080
then the cops got to take them in for indecent exposure.

72
00:04:41.200 --> 00:04:43.060
I'm talking about monkeys are people.

73
00:04:43.061 --> 00:04:47.230
Now you thought that the Corona virus was.

74
00:04:48.070 --> 00:04:52.150
Monkeys are people okay? Dress them up.

75
00:04:52.330 --> 00:04:57.010
Put pants on that monkey. Hey, I got three vows.

76
00:04:57.040 --> 00:04:57.873
Really? Yeah.

77
00:05:02.370 --> 00:05:05.880
Monkey runaway with Corona test samples, locals theory. Here's a video of it.

78
00:05:08.610 --> 00:05:10.080
He's up at the tree with it.

79
00:05:12.750 --> 00:05:13.920
<v 2>He's up in the tree with it.</v>

80
00:05:22.260 --> 00:05:23.093
[inaudible].

81
00:05:23.190 --> 00:05:27.520
<v 0>How nervous do they sound? Okay man. Okay. Wait. Okay.</v>

82
00:05:32.910 --> 00:05:35.520
Oh, the guy did it.

83
00:05:37.380 --> 00:05:41.190
Hey man, the monkey has the vial.

84
00:05:42.420 --> 00:05:47.090
It guy's got a tray. I've got it, dude. Imagine,

85
00:05:47.430 --> 00:05:51.270
ah. We need our top line of defense. Ah. Who are we going to cut?

86
00:05:51.550 --> 00:05:55.050
And I got the guy to call and a bad-ass comes in like a Jason,

87
00:05:55.260 --> 00:05:59.060
stay them on a motorcycle or in like a McLaren.

88
00:05:59.210 --> 00:06:01.280
And he pulls up and he pops out and he's like,

89
00:06:01.460 --> 00:06:04.940
I got this and walks up to the monkey and he's like gas.

90
00:06:14.200 --> 00:06:18.370
Even Jason stay. Even the Indian Jason, stay them. Couldn't do it. No, no, no.

91
00:06:18.371 --> 00:06:20.590
I got a guy. Stand back. There he goes. So I'm running after him.

92
00:06:20.591 --> 00:06:22.420
I got him as he's running.

93
00:06:22.480 --> 00:06:27.430
[inaudible] really going to

94
00:06:27.431 --> 00:06:30.040
kill you. [inaudible].

95
00:06:30.040 --> 00:06:30.040
 He's got three vials back. There's two more, but two more vials 

96
00:06:30.040 --> 00:06:30.873
guys. Just in different directions. There's three of them. [inaudible]

97
00:06:41.890 --> 00:06:45.340
and one monkey falls for it. Guys. He's doing that guys. I'll be right back.

98
00:06:45.341 --> 00:06:47.740
I just want to go see what he wants. So maybe he's got bread or something. No,

99
00:06:47.741 --> 00:06:50.410
don't fall for it. No, no, no. It's going to be fine. It's going to be fine.

100
00:06:50.770 --> 00:06:54.520
Hey, get closer. Got them. Get the vial. Ah. Ah,

101
00:06:55.450 --> 00:06:57.220
get away. I knew he didn't have bread. Go

102
00:07:00.010 --> 00:07:02.830
running out of running out of a building like it's fast.

103
00:07:02.831 --> 00:07:05.560
And the furious jumped from one building through a window,

104
00:07:05.561 --> 00:07:09.790
into another building. Slow motion in the air. The monkeys got the viral viral,

105
00:07:10.330 --> 00:07:11.560
making it into the window.

106
00:07:11.620 --> 00:07:16.330
The other and the Indian Jason say is just follows them out of the air in slow

107
00:07:16.331 --> 00:07:17.164
motion. Just like this

108
00:07:21.220 --> 00:07:22.053
in slow motion.

109
00:07:33.400 --> 00:07:34.720
I get one of the files left,

110
00:07:34.721 --> 00:07:38.350
but there's still 90 minutes left in this movie and we need to get two more.

111
00:07:41.800 --> 00:07:45.820
Dress him up. All right, babies.

112
00:07:46.120 --> 00:07:47.530
I think that's it. We'll end on that one.
