00:00:00.270 --> 00:00:04.610
<v 0>Dude when I was in Oakland, first of all. So Oakland dude,</v>

2
00:00:04.611 --> 00:00:07.730
when I was in Oakland, I, for some reason,

3
00:00:07.731 --> 00:00:12.590
I always thought that Oakland had so much graffiti in it.

4
00:00:12.620 --> 00:00:14.060
I don't know why I thought that.

5
00:00:14.540 --> 00:00:19.430
I don't know if I saw a movie or some or whatever,

6
00:00:19.730 --> 00:00:23.390
but when I got to Oakland, everything was graffitied and yeah, I was like,

7
00:00:23.450 --> 00:00:28.070
I was right. How did I know that I've never been in Oakland, got to Oakland,

8
00:00:28.071 --> 00:00:31.610
saw everything that was spray painted in bubbly letters. Oh,

9
00:00:31.910 --> 00:00:36.530
Clint is so gangster dude. Like the street,

10
00:00:36.560 --> 00:00:40.160
like the side of Starbucks has colorful,

11
00:00:40.790 --> 00:00:44.720
popping off letters and. It,

12
00:00:44.780 --> 00:00:48.380
everything is graffitied. You park your car, you walk into a place,

13
00:00:48.381 --> 00:00:50.510
you come back, your car got graffiti on the side of it.

14
00:00:51.890 --> 00:00:56.360
And it just says Oakland zone with the Z Oakland zone

15
00:00:57.350 --> 00:01:01.430
Oakland's own. Um, yeah, dude.

16
00:01:03.380 --> 00:01:05.150
Um, so, so I went to Oakland,

17
00:01:05.151 --> 00:01:09.890
there was so much graffiti did the show I was with my, I was with two openers.

18
00:01:12.020 --> 00:01:15.230
Uh, the show is pretty good. The theaters beautiful dude.

19
00:01:15.710 --> 00:01:19.250
I don't even know why that theater is so nice. It's so crazy.

20
00:01:19.251 --> 00:01:22.580
When a theater Shona, that theater is so nice. It revamped Oakland.

21
00:01:22.670 --> 00:01:25.310
There were like two blocks of Oakland that were like really nice.

22
00:01:25.311 --> 00:01:28.910
And then the rest of it, you can get, so killed

23
00:01:30.740 --> 00:01:33.740
two blocks to Oakland, beautiful. The rest of the blocks Oakland,

24
00:01:33.770 --> 00:01:38.420
you can get so killed. But, um, so, um, no,

25
00:01:38.421 --> 00:01:40.040
but Oakland is like, apparently the,

26
00:01:40.940 --> 00:01:44.600
the place that they're like gentrifying next outside,

27
00:01:44.601 --> 00:01:48.800
it's like the silver Lake of San Francisco. Um, but, uh,

28
00:01:49.010 --> 00:01:52.040
so I did the show got back. It was really not much to do in Oakland,

29
00:01:52.041 --> 00:01:55.520
at least on a Thursday night. Uh,

30
00:01:55.640 --> 00:01:57.410
and so I,

31
00:01:57.860 --> 00:02:02.180
so we went back then we tried to get, um,

32
00:02:02.390 --> 00:02:06.710
a delivery for food, uh, from an app

33
00:02:08.270 --> 00:02:12.470
and we got it and waited

34
00:02:12.980 --> 00:02:15.860
for an hour, which is sometimes how long it takes. Understood.

35
00:02:16.040 --> 00:02:20.510
Maybe Thursday night in Oakland is a busy time for the food app

36
00:02:21.050 --> 00:02:23.420
service, uh,

37
00:02:23.780 --> 00:02:27.980
called me 50 minutes in and said, Hey, sorry.

38
00:02:28.850 --> 00:02:33.380
Uh, but the pizza place, you tried to get pizza from w ran out of dough,

39
00:02:34.760 --> 00:02:36.800
50 minutes, 50 minutes in dude.

40
00:02:37.490 --> 00:02:40.910
Now my level of rage through the roof,

41
00:02:41.600 --> 00:02:46.340
call me in the beginning. You got them pizza place this way,

42
00:02:47.270 --> 00:02:51.890
we diminish it. The fire rage. Okay. Breathe through.

43
00:02:51.891 --> 00:02:55.490
It was starving. Still thought, you know what?

44
00:02:56.510 --> 00:03:00.580
50 minutes in my life, not a big deal. So I'll order another one.

45
00:03:01.060 --> 00:03:04.480
So ordered another one from a different pizza place. That looked way worse,

46
00:03:04.481 --> 00:03:06.790
but it doesn't matter because I was just hungry at this point.

47
00:03:06.820 --> 00:03:10.930
I need to fill my belly right. Ordered another place from a pizza place.

48
00:03:12.460 --> 00:03:14.950
No called me 50 minutes later.

49
00:03:15.790 --> 00:03:20.530
And the place ran out of ran out of dough.

50
00:03:20.920 --> 00:03:25.330
Okay. So now that's two different pizza places that ran out of dough.

51
00:03:25.600 --> 00:03:28.870
Now, Hey, this is where I say pizza place.

52
00:03:30.340 --> 00:03:32.920
Don't run at a dough because that's how you make pizza.

53
00:03:33.160 --> 00:03:35.590
And if you don't have dough, then you don't have pizza.

54
00:03:35.830 --> 00:03:38.050
And if you don't have pizza, you're not a pizza place.

55
00:03:38.260 --> 00:03:39.400
And for not a pizza place,

56
00:03:39.610 --> 00:03:43.690
you're not making money any other way because your job is having a pizza place

57
00:03:44.650 --> 00:03:47.440
and you need a job in this world. Okay?

58
00:03:48.370 --> 00:03:53.350
So I ordered from a third pizza place, no. I waited an hour.

59
00:03:53.890 --> 00:03:56.380
They called.

60
00:03:56.650 --> 00:04:00.820
I called them and they said, and this is no.

61
00:04:02.710 --> 00:04:03.610
We ran out of dough.

62
00:04:04.750 --> 00:04:07.600
This is the third pizza place in Oakland that ran out of dough.

63
00:04:08.140 --> 00:04:12.310
Now this is three hours in no dough, anywhere in Oakland.

64
00:04:13.030 --> 00:04:16.300
I'm trying to get pizza. I can't get it.

65
00:04:16.870 --> 00:04:19.090
So now I'm.

66
00:04:20.260 --> 00:04:24.280
I can't be so I'm. So, you know, when you're hungry, everything is more angry.

67
00:04:24.281 --> 00:04:28.810
And so I'm so angry. Now it's 3:00 AM. All right.

68
00:04:29.770 --> 00:04:34.360
Now I say, these pizza places in Oakland. All right,

69
00:04:35.090 --> 00:04:38.290
I'm going to go to a diner. I go on the app.

70
00:04:39.130 --> 00:04:42.460
I look for a diner. The diner closes at four.

71
00:04:42.670 --> 00:04:46.480
I look at how long it's going to take me to get this Turkey sandwich or whatever

72
00:04:46.481 --> 00:04:50.020
the hell I get. It's going to take 35 minutes. Okay?

73
00:04:50.440 --> 00:04:55.270
So now I order the from the app. It says,

74
00:04:55.271 --> 00:04:59.500
it's coming at 35, 40, 50 minutes, whatever the it is, I call the diner.

75
00:05:00.220 --> 00:05:02.860
I say, Hey diner, this is what happened.

76
00:05:03.310 --> 00:05:05.350
I tried to get a thing from three different pizza places.

77
00:05:05.351 --> 00:05:08.440
And it couldn't come through. Now. I know you come up, you close at four.

78
00:05:08.590 --> 00:05:10.750
Cause I checked online, covered my bases, my babies.

79
00:05:11.980 --> 00:05:15.610
So I looked so I called them and I said,

80
00:05:15.640 --> 00:05:20.230
I just want to make sure that if the Postmates guy is late and gets there at

81
00:05:20.231 --> 00:05:21.580
like four or five or whatever the

82
00:05:23.350 --> 00:05:27.430
that you're not gonna not let them in. Okay.

83
00:05:28.150 --> 00:05:32.890
And, and whatever. And the guy says, Oh no, we make the,

84
00:05:32.920 --> 00:05:36.340
we make the food. That's no problem. We make the food. I said, okay,

85
00:05:36.970 --> 00:05:41.050
we're going to make it right now. They make it right now. Okay.

86
00:05:43.930 --> 00:05:47.560
The, the restaurant at 4:00 AM

87
00:05:48.700 --> 00:05:51.730
cancels. My cancer's my order. Okay.

88
00:05:52.450 --> 00:05:56.740
I've stayed up for hours to try and eat. I should have slept,

89
00:05:56.870 --> 00:05:59.120
stayed up. Cause I saw hungry. All right.

90
00:05:59.300 --> 00:06:04.300
Didn't now just cause I had to watch the purge movie during the whole

91
00:06:04.301 --> 00:06:07.510
thing, the origin, the origin story of the purge, whatever the.

92
00:06:07.810 --> 00:06:12.160
I'm a big purge movie fan. I love the purge movies. The SA the, the, the,

93
00:06:12.190 --> 00:06:15.490
they did the three and then they did the one that was like supposed to be the

94
00:06:16.030 --> 00:06:19.150
prequel. And that one was just, I liked them all.

95
00:06:19.151 --> 00:06:22.660
And that one was just not that it wasn't that good. Sorry.

96
00:06:23.560 --> 00:06:26.910
It's all good. But you know what you did, you know, you got damned.

97
00:06:26.911 --> 00:06:31.420

102
00:06:45.610 --> 00:06:49.270
Hey, Hey dude, you know, he got him dead.

103
00:06:49.840 --> 00:06:52.690
It was bad. It was bad.

104
00:06:55.180 --> 00:06:58.960
All these, so many of these movies are bad, whatever, but it's all good.

105
00:06:58.961 --> 00:07:03.040
They keep making them why even make a movie now just get a YouTube channel.

106
00:07:03.041 --> 00:07:06.790
You know? Uh, I guess, I don't know. I,
