00:00:01.680 --> 00:00:05.670
<v 0>No. I was thinking about man, these chicks on Instagram.</v>

2
00:00:06.660 --> 00:00:11.070
That just like post, basically this hookery.

3
00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:16.080
Look, if you're a hook, if you're,

4
00:00:16.110 --> 00:00:20.040
if you're trying to get followers as a chick and you're just posting your body

5
00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:24.630
and your rump make no mistake, no bones about it.

6
00:00:25.530 --> 00:00:28.410
Yuck and K followers is the new currency.

7
00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:32.190
You've probably said that before to your friends. If it's the new currency,

8
00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:36.930
then if you're posting your rump for followers, yuck. All right.

9
00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:41.490
And that's it. Hey, guess what we're done with the combo? Cause there's no,

10
00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:45.930
there's no rebuttal because that's what it is. Congratulations.

11
00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:51.270
Um, I mean, dude,

12
00:00:52.010 --> 00:00:56.690
what I want to know is who's taking it these pictures. If you're a guy,

13
00:00:56.750 --> 00:01:01.010
I saw a video on Instagram the other day where,

14
00:01:01.820 --> 00:01:05.480
um, uh, the, the, they were,

15
00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:08.990
the guide showed the guy, he was out running Canyon. He was at,

16
00:01:09.290 --> 00:01:12.620
I can't remember. Who's, she's a fan of the podcast. I know too.

17
00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:16.430
And she was showing the video. She was, she caught this guy,

18
00:01:16.431 --> 00:01:21.260
like videoing this girl while she was twerking

19
00:01:21.290 --> 00:01:25.370
on Runyon Canyon. And this dude was like, all you dude.

20
00:01:25.371 --> 00:01:29.750
When my dad used to take pictures of, of like our family on, on vacation,

21
00:01:29.990 --> 00:01:34.550
he would do it. So, like he would be, he had the camera and he would be like,

22
00:01:34.670 --> 00:01:36.260
he would be like this, like a,

23
00:01:37.070 --> 00:01:41.240
like one time we were on a gondola and he was trying to not fall over into the

24
00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:47.660
into the ocean. And he was just taking a picture like this.

25
00:01:47.661 --> 00:01:51.680
And my brother was like, what a? And we were laughing and he got a good shot,

26
00:01:51.681 --> 00:01:55.580
but he was still a. But dude, the more like you look when you take a photo,

27
00:01:55.581 --> 00:01:58.550
the better the photo comes out and you know it. So that's the thing.

28
00:01:58.700 --> 00:02:03.680
These dudes are taking pictures of their girlfriends that are,

29
00:02:03.740 --> 00:02:08.240
you know, to get them more followers. And dude,

30
00:02:08.390 --> 00:02:11.330
they look like man.

31
00:02:12.470 --> 00:02:16.370
And these girls like, dude,

32
00:02:17.090 --> 00:02:21.020

33
00:02:22.130 --> 00:02:26.900
and the sandwich meat and the lettuce was all fallen out and it was so

34
00:02:26.901 --> 00:02:30.020
goofy. She's just a silly girl.

35
00:02:31.010 --> 00:02:34.700
She's just a silly girl with a crop top on,

36
00:02:35.390 --> 00:02:38.420
let Mayo spill out of that sandwich.

37
00:02:38.960 --> 00:02:41.210
What a silly girl, dude.

38
00:02:41.960 --> 00:02:46.040
How do you get so silly?

39
00:02:46.670 --> 00:02:49.880

That's what you do when a food is so good. You put your eyes up to the right.

47
00:03:19.270 --> 00:03:22.870
