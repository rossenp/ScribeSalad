00:00:01.050 --> 00:00:03.540
<v 0>Scientologists. When you drive past an accident,</v>

2
00:00:03.990 --> 00:00:07.380
it's not like anyone else as you drive past, you know,

3
00:00:07.381 --> 00:00:09.240
you have to do something about him. Okay.

4
00:00:11.120 --> 00:00:13.310
<v 1>That's that's, that's, that's what you do.</v>

5
00:00:14.450 --> 00:00:18.260
That's what you do as, as a Scientologist,

6
00:00:18.500 --> 00:00:22.040
which me and Tom cruise are because dude, if there was an accident on the road,

7
00:00:22.340 --> 00:00:23.173
I would stop.

8
00:00:24.110 --> 00:00:28.880
<v 0>When you drive past an accident, it's not like anyone else as you drive past,</v>

9
00:00:29.300 --> 00:00:32.900
you know, you have to do something about it because you know,

10
00:00:32.901 --> 00:00:34.310
you're the only one they can really help.

11
00:00:38.870 --> 00:00:43.220
<v 1>Because I do that. I am in Scientology, dude. Do you guys get it?</v>

12
00:00:44.720 --> 00:00:49.040
Tom cruise and I are Scientologists. I,

13
00:00:50.060 --> 00:00:54.830
every time I've seen a car accident, I've stopped, got out and helped everybody.

14
00:00:54.831 --> 00:00:55.820
I can even see.

15
00:00:59.600 --> 00:00:59.870
<v 0>Okay.</v>

16
00:00:59.870 --> 00:01:04.160
<v 1>Dude, I, you think I'm lying every single time,</v>

17
00:01:04.161 --> 00:01:06.770
no matter how fast I'm going, no matter what road I'm on.

18
00:01:06.830 --> 00:01:11.600
If I see any accident from a one there where somebody for

19
00:01:11.601 --> 00:01:14.990
sure died or a fender bender, even if somebody like,

20
00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:17.570
kind of like is by themselves,

21
00:01:17.571 --> 00:01:22.550
but kind of rolls up on the curb by taking a right turn. I, I literally,

22
00:01:22.580 --> 00:01:25.130
and they, even, if they keep driving, I pull, I pull,

23
00:01:25.160 --> 00:01:29.540
I make them pull over and I help. Dude. You think.

24
00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:34.280
<v 0>It's not like anyone else as you drive past, you know,</v>

25
00:01:34.281 --> 00:01:37.250
you have to do something about it because you know,

26
00:01:37.251 --> 00:01:39.350
you're the only one they can really help you.

27
00:01:39.830 --> 00:01:43.850
<v 1>I do it one time. I got a guy hit another car. It was really light.</v>

28
00:01:43.851 --> 00:01:45.050
It was only 15 miles an hour.

29
00:01:45.230 --> 00:01:47.570
And he hit the guy and the guy bumped in and it goes hunk.

30
00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:50.420
And he got out and they both got out and I was driving by dude.

31
00:01:51.350 --> 00:01:54.560
I was driving by from the freeway. They were on a side street. I pulled,

32
00:01:54.590 --> 00:01:58.430
I got off the next exit. I tried to find them. I found them, I got them.

33
00:01:58.431 --> 00:02:02.900
I got out. And I said, is everybody okay? And they were like, what? And I said,

34
00:02:02.930 --> 00:02:06.590
are you guys okay? And they said, yeah, it was just like a little fender bender.

35
00:02:06.591 --> 00:02:08.870
We're going to get each other's information. And I said, okay,

36
00:02:08.930 --> 00:02:12.290
is there anything I can do? And the guys were like, no, not really.

37
00:02:12.291 --> 00:02:15.950
You're not needed. And I said, I'm going to get you guys some coffee.

38
00:02:16.010 --> 00:02:18.590
And I went to the nearest Starbucks. I got them some coffee.

39
00:02:18.591 --> 00:02:23.180
I came back and they were gone at that time, whatever. But I, you know,

40
00:02:23.181 --> 00:02:27.050
I drank the coffee myself, but dude, do you think I I'm.

41
00:02:29.420 --> 00:02:31.970
<v 0>Exactly. Yeah. Being a Scientologist.</v>

42
00:02:32.930 --> 00:02:34.970
When you drive past an accident, do you understand me?

43
00:02:34.971 --> 00:02:39.110
It's not like anyone else as you drive past and know you have to do something

44
00:02:39.111 --> 00:02:42.080
about it because okay.

45
00:02:45.380 --> 00:02:47.060
You know, you're the only one they can really help.

46
00:02:47.780 --> 00:02:51.050
<v 1>Anyone else. Would've gotten them coffee, dude. No.</v>

47
00:02:51.830 --> 00:02:55.760
Do you think anyone else would have stopped? If I see an accident I'm stopping.

48
00:02:55.940 --> 00:03:00.010
If I, you know, when you're at home and you're just, you know,

49
00:03:00.280 --> 00:03:04.990
in a cafe and you hear aye, bro, aye,

50
00:03:05.140 --> 00:03:08.710
you don't see me anymore. When that happens. If we're at a cafe

51
00:03:10.350 --> 00:03:14.740
and, and, and you hear you better and you're talking to me,

52
00:03:15.130 --> 00:03:19.330
you better stop because this conversation

53
00:03:19.810 --> 00:03:22.930
is taking a hiatus

54
00:03:24.520 --> 00:03:25.150
because I'm,

55
00:03:25.150 --> 00:03:29.470
I'm running out of the cafe and I'm looking at where the does that sound come

56
00:03:29.471 --> 00:03:31.660
from? I'm going, where's that going to come from? Pure? Like what,

57
00:03:31.780 --> 00:03:34.240
what sound I say? Did you read the screen? Says, yeah. I say,

58
00:03:34.540 --> 00:03:37.140
we're wanting to come from either. I think that area and I'm running dude.

59
00:03:38.100 --> 00:03:42.660
<v 0>As you drive past, you know, you have to do something about it because you know,</v>

60
00:03:42.661 --> 00:03:44.070
you're the only one they can really help.

61
00:03:45.960 --> 00:03:47.670
<v 1>Okay. That's it.</v>

62
00:03:49.740 --> 00:03:50.573
<v 0>Cause that's,</v>

63
00:03:50.970 --> 00:03:55.950
that's what drives me is that I know that we have an opportunity and

64
00:03:56.400 --> 00:03:57.233
uh,

65
00:03:58.140 --> 00:04:01.650
to really help for the first time

66
00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:05.460
effectively change people's lives.

67
00:04:05.880 --> 00:04:09.090
<v 1>Coffee for people in fender benders. That's it I'll get them,</v>

68
00:04:09.091 --> 00:04:12.180
whatever the they want. If I see someone in a fender-bender, I go like this,

69
00:04:12.210 --> 00:04:13.320
can I take your

70
00:04:16.110 --> 00:04:19.950
advice and say, ah, for sake, ah, son of a. Oh, can I get your information?

71
00:04:19.980 --> 00:04:24.570
I drive up. I say, Hey, can I take your order? And they say, what I say,

72
00:04:24.571 --> 00:04:27.570
I'm going to Starbucks. I'm just trying to do everything I can to help.

73
00:04:28.050 --> 00:04:31.380
And they say, ah, we don't need coffee. And I say, if you wanted coffee,

74
00:04:31.381 --> 00:04:34.140
what would you want? And then the guy would be like, I don't know.

75
00:04:34.141 --> 00:04:36.120
Maybe I would, I would probably get like a,

76
00:04:37.020 --> 00:04:40.230
a venti frappuccino if they have like, kind of like with a caramel thing.

77
00:04:40.231 --> 00:04:42.180
And I would say, I'll be right back.

78
00:04:43.920 --> 00:04:48.480
<v 0>Cause that's, that's what drives me is that I know that we have an opportunity.</v>

79
00:04:48.630 --> 00:04:51.840
<v 1>I walk into Starbucks and I say, hi, and I wait in line and I'm wait.</v>

80
00:04:51.930 --> 00:04:54.810
And I'm amped waiting. And like the line's long, I'm amped. I'm ready, dude.

81
00:04:54.930 --> 00:04:59.460
Cause I'm a Scion tologist dude and I'm ready and I'm in line and I'm just

82
00:04:59.461 --> 00:05:01.650
waiting. And when I get up there and I say, I'm dude,

83
00:05:01.651 --> 00:05:05.190
and I guess what I got in my head when I'm,

84
00:05:06.300 --> 00:05:11.040
when I'm, when I'm, when I'm ordering, when, when I'm in line all day,

85
00:05:11.340 --> 00:05:12.173
all day

86
00:05:16.470 --> 00:05:20.430
and I'm in line dude, and I'm just, and I'm waiting, dude,

87
00:05:22.830 --> 00:05:25.620
wait. And dude, and they go tended to say, can I take your order? And it's like,

88
00:05:25.680 --> 00:05:29.130
yeah, I'd like a tea frappuccino. I need a bed there for it. But you know,

89
00:05:29.131 --> 00:05:31.020
in anything, you got caramel on it and I need a,

90
00:05:31.350 --> 00:05:34.530
now I got a guy at a fender better down the street and I need that.

91
00:05:34.650 --> 00:05:39.210
What's your name, my name, you know what you put on the cuff Scientologists?

92
00:05:39.240 --> 00:05:41.880
And they say, okay man, just chill. And I say, I will not chill.

93
00:05:41.881 --> 00:05:44.790
I got an accident down the street and they go, okay, cool.

94
00:05:44.850 --> 00:05:47.400
And I'm watching the out of them. Do it too, dude.

95
00:05:47.610 --> 00:05:50.730
They're making the frappuccino dude. And there's closeup shots,

96
00:05:51.540 --> 00:05:53.520
of the frappuccino, bam, bam.

97
00:05:53.700 --> 00:05:56.730
And they're making the and I'm watching them and I'm, and I'm a low too.

98
00:05:56.850 --> 00:05:57.261
I'm the,

99
00:05:57.261 --> 00:06:01.400
you know how there's a glass thing and I'm right above the lip of the F of the

100
00:06:01.401 --> 00:06:03.050
wall and I'm watching them like this.

101
00:06:06.130 --> 00:06:09.280
So, and they're like, dude, are you cool? And I'm like, I'm cool,

102
00:06:09.281 --> 00:06:11.350
but there's people out there that were in a fender bender.

103
00:06:12.340 --> 00:06:14.560
And then they go like this and they go and they look at the drink and they'd say

104
00:06:15.160 --> 00:06:15.580
Scion top.

105
00:06:15.580 --> 00:06:18.820
And they get to that and I've already grabbed it and I'm running dude.

106
00:06:19.240 --> 00:06:22.360
And I say, and I say, where are the straws? And they point over there.

107
00:06:22.361 --> 00:06:25.930
And I say, and I look, and if they got the paper straws, I take a bunch of them.

108
00:06:25.931 --> 00:06:28.360
And I throw them in the face of the employee. Cause I go like this,

109
00:06:28.660 --> 00:06:32.080
that doesn't help turtles. And then I run out. If they got plastic drawers,

110
00:06:32.081 --> 00:06:33.520
I'm jamming it in the pocket thing. If they don't,

111
00:06:33.521 --> 00:06:36.990
I take the top off and I'm running dude. And when I say I take the top off,

112
00:06:36.991 --> 00:06:40.360
I mean, I take, I ripped my shirt off and I'm running dude. And I go,

113
00:06:40.361 --> 00:06:42.040
here are your frappuccinos.

114
00:06:45.340 --> 00:06:47.800
And they go, Oh thanks man. And if they're gone,

115
00:06:47.801 --> 00:06:52.690
I drip the frappucino all over my chest. And it's so,

116
00:06:54.190 --> 00:06:56.290
and I mean this from the bottom of my heart dude,

117
00:06:56.590 --> 00:07:01.120
it's so God sexy that it's on

118
00:07:01.390 --> 00:07:03.850
real and it probably causes more accent.

119
00:07:04.090 --> 00:07:04.930
<v 0>And uh,</v>

120
00:07:06.670 --> 00:07:10.180
to really help for the first time

121
00:07:11.530 --> 00:07:14.440
effectively change people's lives. And

122
00:07:16.030 --> 00:07:19.360
I am dedicated that I'm gonna, um, absolutely.

123
00:07:20.440 --> 00:07:24.400
Uncompromisingly dedicated.

124
00:07:25.780 --> 00:07:30.010
<v 1>It's the words that we Scientologists live by. It is a hundred percent.</v>

125
00:07:31.240 --> 00:07:33.490
And just to top this off,

126
00:07:33.820 --> 00:07:38.620
if you're listening to this and not watching

127
00:07:38.621 --> 00:07:39.454
this,

128
00:07:40.720 --> 00:07:45.160
he did this interview in a

129
00:07:45.430 --> 00:07:46.450
turd on that.

130
00:07:52.660 --> 00:07:56.500
Boom was that Hiroshima

131
00:07:57.160 --> 00:07:58.540
because dude,

132
00:07:58.600 --> 00:08:03.160
that's the ultimate bomb dropper at the end of this.

133
00:08:04.330 --> 00:08:08.320
You said all this Ana turtleneck,

134
00:08:09.220 --> 00:08:12.190
Hey dude, that's it. That's how it ends.

135
00:08:15.940 --> 00:08:19.930
One time I was friends. I was friends with the dude that was wearing a, Oh God,

136
00:08:20.140 --> 00:08:23.980
this guy made me laugh. I'm not going to say his name is buddy, but Holy.

137
00:08:24.760 --> 00:08:28.420
One time I used to live with him and he used to talk like this ma'am this is how

138
00:08:28.421 --> 00:08:31.870
we talk, man. Whew. You would laugh like that.

139
00:08:33.190 --> 00:08:35.950
And he would be like, I talked to him before the podcast, but he goes like this.

140
00:08:35.950 --> 00:08:39.520
He says, man, one time do, he was always trying to get checks. It was so funny.

141
00:08:39.521 --> 00:08:42.100
He's he's like married now and, I don't know if he has kids or whatever,

142
00:08:42.101 --> 00:08:45.580
but he was, you know, he's like a guy and he was just like, Oh man,

143
00:08:46.600 --> 00:08:49.870
Oh man chicks, dude. He'd say like that.

144
00:08:49.960 --> 00:08:53.320
He was so he was eh, sir, from Ventura,

145
00:08:53.321 --> 00:08:57.690
California is unbelievable. He was, he couldn't have been more from Ventura,

146
00:08:57.691 --> 00:09:00.450
California. Unbelievable. He was from Ventura conference. So hard.

147
00:09:00.480 --> 00:09:03.270
His name was Ventura. That's what he'd be.

148
00:09:03.300 --> 00:09:04.950
I should call him his first name is Mike.

149
00:09:04.951 --> 00:09:09.690
He's extra calm Mike Ventura pet detective man. Anyway.

150
00:09:10.170 --> 00:09:15.000
Um, Uh, and he looked for real,

151
00:09:15.001 --> 00:09:18.240
like a serial killer. Like he had this impossible look in his eyes.

152
00:09:19.170 --> 00:09:21.690
That was just like, when you think of him, in retrospect,

153
00:09:22.140 --> 00:09:26.280
you imagine all of his, his whole, I, even the Iris and the pupil,

154
00:09:26.281 --> 00:09:30.930
all of it in the white part. It's all Brown. That's how I imagined him.

155
00:09:31.410 --> 00:09:34.620
Anyway. He's sexy too.

156
00:09:35.700 --> 00:09:36.870
He was just a sexy dude.

157
00:09:36.871 --> 00:09:40.560
Girls loved this dude because he just didn't give a anyway.

158
00:09:41.850 --> 00:09:46.230
Anyway, dude. Um, what story was I telling?

159
00:09:47.300 --> 00:09:49.740
Who, what was it? Oh yeah. So he was in Las Vegas once man,

160
00:09:49.741 --> 00:09:53.280
I went to Las Vegas once did this story made me laugh so hard. I cried.

161
00:09:53.281 --> 00:09:56.910
He said I went to Las Vegas once man. And I was walking around man.

162
00:09:58.020 --> 00:09:59.970
Cause he had a turtleneck on when we were talking, I was like,

163
00:09:59.971 --> 00:10:02.250
you were turtlenecks bro. He's like, yeah man.

164
00:10:02.340 --> 00:10:06.060
So I was in Las Vegas once and I was just walking around man. And dude,

165
00:10:06.900 --> 00:10:10.530
I swear to God, dude. I was like, you know, we were all trying to get chicks.

166
00:10:10.531 --> 00:10:14.760
But like every time I saw the ho a hot girl walking around in Las Vegas,

167
00:10:15.090 --> 00:10:18.260
she was always with a dude wearing a turtleneck. And I was like, man, man,

168
00:10:18.570 --> 00:10:22.440
I get to get a turtleneck. This was in Vegas. So I went,

169
00:10:22.520 --> 00:10:26.310
I left the group to get a turtle neck and I was like, you did. And he was like,

170
00:10:26.550 --> 00:10:27.240
yeah man,

171
00:10:27.240 --> 00:10:31.110
all of these girls had the hot ha all these hot chicks had dudes with Terminix

172
00:10:31.111 --> 00:10:34.050
on me. And I was like, how many did you see? He was like, I swear to God,

173
00:10:34.051 --> 00:10:38.070
me and every girl all with guys with turtlenecks. So I got a torn, lik dude,

174
00:10:38.400 --> 00:10:40.410
I got like an award that night. I swear to God,

175
00:10:40.411 --> 00:10:42.000
I got the hottest chicken Las Vegas.

176
00:10:45.140 --> 00:10:48.110
And he was my favorite guy in my life at that point.

177
00:10:48.920 --> 00:10:52.520
That was the guy he usurped all my family members and friends beforehand.

178
00:10:55.580 --> 00:10:58.790
That was dude. It was so funny to me. Cause I was like,

179
00:10:58.791 --> 00:11:03.200
I didn't know if he actually thought that it was for real.

180
00:11:06.110 --> 00:11:06.943
Uh,

181
00:11:07.310 --> 00:11:11.120
I didn't know if he actually thought it was for real the turtleneck or if he was

182
00:11:11.121 --> 00:11:15.590
in on the joke. That's why I liked him. When guys, when I,

183
00:11:17.300 --> 00:11:21.650
when guys, when guys who, cause I'm always, I always like,

184
00:11:21.651 --> 00:11:25.550
feel like I know if someone is for real or not,

185
00:11:25.700 --> 00:11:27.380
but that was making me laugh.

186
00:11:28.730 --> 00:11:30.740
There's somebody commented under this mission possible.

187
00:11:30.770 --> 00:11:31.910
Under the Scientology thing,

188
00:11:32.840 --> 00:11:36.440
you can skip to any point of the video and still have no clue what the actual

189
00:11:36.441 --> 00:11:37.460
hell he's talking about.

190
00:11:41.840 --> 00:11:44.990
<v 0>Works are there to help. Okay. But we, as you know,</v>

191
00:11:45.260 --> 00:11:48.170
as also the public to say we have responsibilities,

192
00:11:48.200 --> 00:11:51.230
not just as we can bring peace

193
00:11:52.990 --> 00:11:56.140
and unite cultures, let's get to any part

194
00:11:58.330 --> 00:12:02.140
that once you know these tools and you know that they work it's,

195
00:12:02.890 --> 00:12:07.120
it's not good enough, but play,

196
00:12:07.420 --> 00:12:12.150
just do that. You know what I mean? I mean,

197
00:12:14.470 --> 00:12:19.210
that's what I want it to be. Okay. That's how I would,

198
00:12:19.270 --> 00:12:21.130
you know, there's times I'd like to do that. But.

199
00:12:21.720 --> 00:12:24.120
<v 1>My favorite part about this video is that it's cut together.</v>

200
00:12:24.121 --> 00:12:26.580
So you can't like there's no interview questions.

201
00:12:26.820 --> 00:12:30.870
I like to imagine the interviewer or either I either like to imagine the

202
00:12:31.320 --> 00:12:35.970
interviewer just like this just the whole time,

203
00:12:35.971 --> 00:12:40.590
just like just stuttering, like the King's speech.

204
00:12:40.920 --> 00:12:42.560
Like Colin Firth, just like I, uh,

205
00:12:43.010 --> 00:12:46.860
I remember that where they put that in the preview.

206
00:12:46.920 --> 00:12:51.210
I uh, and you were like, all right guys, so we get it. You know,

207
00:12:51.211 --> 00:12:54.540
he stutters calling for killed in that role. I didn't see it,

208
00:12:54.541 --> 00:12:56.310
but I know he killed it and he just started the Oscar.

209
00:12:56.311 --> 00:12:59.730
And I know he deserved the Oscar because I saw a clip of a scene where he was

210
00:12:59.731 --> 00:13:02.610
like, I,

211
00:13:02.611 --> 00:13:04.950
and if you're trying to kill it,

212
00:13:04.951 --> 00:13:09.330
playing a part of a guy who stuttered and do it that much, dude,

213
00:13:09.570 --> 00:13:14.220
Hey Oscar, there you go. Golden global ward. There you go.

214
00:13:14.940 --> 00:13:18.540
Actor's choice award. There you go. Sag award. There you go.

215
00:13:18.810 --> 00:13:21.870
NAACP award. There you go. I know you're not black, but I don't give a.

216
00:13:22.020 --> 00:13:23.010
You get all the awards.

217
00:13:24.420 --> 00:13:27.810
I want to play a stutterer and straight up be a dude. That's just

218
00:13:30.030 --> 00:13:33.870
dude, I'll kill it, dude. You think I won't kill it? I don't give a, dude.

219
00:13:33.871 --> 00:13:37.080
I'll kill it, dude.

220
00:13:38.190 --> 00:13:41.760
You put me in a movie where the drama dude, that's it, it's over.

221
00:13:42.900 --> 00:13:43.733
It's over.

222
00:13:46.290 --> 00:13:47.940
I'm going to be the best actor around dude.

223
00:13:53.730 --> 00:13:56.010
And you know how people on set will be like,

224
00:13:56.040 --> 00:13:59.340
I don't know if this is working and then that cuts together and you see me just,

225
00:14:00.030 --> 00:14:03.520
Oh, I that's it do it.

226
00:14:03.780 --> 00:14:07.320
It's like he really people talking about it like, Oh, so how's the shoot going?

227
00:14:07.350 --> 00:14:11.610
Yeah, he's playing a stutter. You know, we got, he's really going for it, man.

228
00:14:11.611 --> 00:14:14.490
It's kind of weird. I'm not sure. And then you cut that together.

229
00:14:14.520 --> 00:14:16.710
And the Oscar goes to Chris,

230
00:14:16.920 --> 00:14:21.840
the Eliya and I get up on stage and I get my acceptance speech.

231
00:14:22.680 --> 00:14:26.100
I give my acceptance speech and you know what it sounds like. Yeah.

232
00:14:26.250 --> 00:14:31.050
<v 0>When you drive past an accident, it's not like anyone else as you drive past,</v>

233
00:14:31.400 --> 00:14:34.560
you know, you have to do something about it because you know,

234
00:14:34.561 --> 00:14:37.230
you're the only one that can really help. Cause that's,

235
00:14:38.010 --> 00:14:41.370
that's what drives me is that I know that we have an opportunity

236
00:14:42.570 --> 00:14:47.070
and uh, to really help.

237
00:14:48.750 --> 00:14:51.950
<v 1>Ah, thank you. Very crystal clear one for the princess speech.</v>

238
00:14:53.990 --> 00:14:58.550
Um, so anyway, life reps, babies, life reps,

239
00:14:58.640 --> 00:15:00.770
life is what you make it. You know what I mean? I know that.

240
00:15:00.771 --> 00:15:03.830
Cause I'm a Scientologist dude. Life rips, life rips.

241
00:15:04.250 --> 00:15:08.360
You just have to realize it rips. And then it rips. That's it. Life rips.

242
00:15:08.390 --> 00:15:11.240
If you think it rips, it doesn't rip. If you don't think it rips,

243
00:15:11.720 --> 00:15:15.530
if you start being like, Oh man, my back, I got back pain. Do I have back pain?

244
00:15:15.620 --> 00:15:18.920
Yes. There's sometimes I get a twinge in my shoulder. Yes.

245
00:15:20.390 --> 00:15:22.760
Do I let it bog me down sometimes? Honestly. Yes.

246
00:15:24.050 --> 00:15:28.250
But then do I stop sometimes? And I realize tomorrow might be a better day. Yes.

247
00:15:28.280 --> 00:15:31.010
And then do I wake up the next day and do I feel better sometimes? Yes.

248
00:15:31.011 --> 00:15:33.710
Sometimes. No, but then the next day do I feel better? Yes.

249
00:15:34.130 --> 00:15:36.890
And that is when I realized that life rips. Yes.

250
00:15:36.891 --> 00:15:40.460
And then there's it start to rip even more? Yes,

251
00:15:41.660 --> 00:15:44.240
that's it. My babies, it's all about attitudes

252
00:15:47.800 --> 00:15:49.900
and he stays drinking. LaCroix

253
00:15:54.130 --> 00:15:57.100
stays keeping her ducking out his mouth dude.

254
00:15:59.260 --> 00:16:02.080
If I was on an Island and somebody was trying to torture me to get information,

255
00:16:02.081 --> 00:16:02.801
I would say no,

256
00:16:02.801 --> 00:16:06.400
unless they tried to put her ducking in my mouth and I'd be like, okay, okay.

257
00:16:06.401 --> 00:16:07.270
I'll tell you did it.
