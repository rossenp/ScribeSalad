00:00:01.320 --> 00:00:06.120
<v 0>It's funny when acting is, uh, like people really take it so seriously,</v>

2
00:00:06.150 --> 00:00:10.070
like Christian bale, just losing weight and chopping his,

3
00:00:10.260 --> 00:00:11.850
and he's doing a new role was chopping his head off.

4
00:00:11.851 --> 00:00:15.210
Did you know that he's playing sleepy hollow and he's legitimately Shoppe

5
00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:18.060
chopping his head off. Uh,

6
00:00:19.020 --> 00:00:22.350
and then he's doing another role where he's just his head. So,

7
00:00:23.010 --> 00:00:24.210
and then that'll be his last role.

8
00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:26.610
They're going to use the head chopped off for another he's shooting two movies

9
00:00:26.611 --> 00:00:28.710
at once. Oh man.

10
00:00:28.711 --> 00:00:33.360
When Christian bale flipped out. Oh, how about this dude?

11
00:00:33.630 --> 00:00:37.260
When Christian bale flipped out. Oh, wow. We never talked about this.

12
00:00:37.261 --> 00:00:42.240
Did we good for you when he does that?

13
00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:49.500
Good for you. So whatever he is flip out on Terminator.

14
00:00:50.230 --> 00:00:51.510
Let me tell you something about this dude.

15
00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:57.210
The Christian bale flip out I'm on Christian bow side. Everyone's like, wow.

16
00:00:57.211 --> 00:00:59.280
What an. that dude.

17
00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:03.480
The lighting guy was with the light when he was acting good.

18
00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:07.020
This is what happened. I don't know if you've heard it.

19
00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:16.680
Here we go. Bruce is dissociated.

20
00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:23.000
<v 1>I want you off the set me prick. No,</v>

21
00:01:23.010 --> 00:01:24.140
don't just be sorry.

22
00:01:24.230 --> 00:01:28.640
Think for one second that the are you

23
00:01:28.910 --> 00:01:30.350
doing dude?

24
00:01:30.740 --> 00:01:35.540
<v 0>It's so I, and the guys being so nice about it. He's like,</v>

25
00:01:35.541 --> 00:01:37.460
I'm sorry, Christian. I'm sorry.

26
00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:42.350
<v 1>Don't just be sorry. Think about what you're doing.</v>

27
00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:47.810
<v 0>So Scottish, but whatever. And, uh, are you professional or not?</v>

28
00:01:48.410 --> 00:01:51.080
Oh, I went for the juggler.

29
00:01:51.680 --> 00:01:56.540
Are you professional or not? Yes, I am. The guy is so nice. He's so nice.

30
00:01:56.541 --> 00:01:57.374
He sounds like a lady.

31
00:01:57.740 --> 00:02:01.190
<v 1>Do I walk around and rip that? No, shut the up.</v>

32
00:02:01.910 --> 00:02:05.960
<v 0>I like, I started to cut them off. He just used that anger. No, shut the up.</v>

33
00:02:06.320 --> 00:02:10.760
Do I walk around? But I know. Shut the up.

34
00:02:11.090 --> 00:02:14.120
You got to let a guy go. When the guy's off the ground like that,

35
00:02:14.270 --> 00:02:17.150
you just got to wait for him to land. You don't say anything.

36
00:02:17.660 --> 00:02:21.500
You start eating crackers for real. If anyone ever gets mad that mad at me,

37
00:02:21.560 --> 00:02:24.230
I carry, you know, I carry around gummy bears. Just for that.

38
00:02:24.410 --> 00:02:29.270
Just in case anyone gets me mad. Gay gets that mad at me. I just, I have a, um,

39
00:02:29.510 --> 00:02:30.680
um, I take out a lawn chair.

40
00:02:30.681 --> 00:02:34.790
I go crap and I wipe it out and I sit down and I opened my gummy bears that I

41
00:02:34.910 --> 00:02:39.380
have been saving. And I just, wait, are you a professional?

42
00:02:39.381 --> 00:02:41.210
And I'm eating Oh, a red one

43
00:02:43.610 --> 00:02:46.760
because you can't do you can't be like, well, no, y'all hold up a second.

44
00:02:46.820 --> 00:02:49.070
It doesn't work. I'm eating gummy bears.

45
00:02:50.420 --> 00:02:53.450
<v 1>No, no. Don't shut me up.</v>

46
00:02:53.960 --> 00:02:56.570
I'm not going to walk around and rip your lights down.

47
00:02:57.230 --> 00:03:00.010
<v 0>Wow. I mean, I'm not going.</v>

48
00:03:00.070 --> 00:03:02.100
<v 1>To walk around and rip your lights down.</v>

49
00:03:02.940 --> 00:03:05.100
<v 0>Obviously not, you know, but maybe he's making up.</v>

50
00:03:05.220 --> 00:03:08.790
<v 1>We're at a point in the middle of a scene then why the are you walking right</v>

51
00:03:08.791 --> 00:03:13.110
through? Ah, like this in the background? What the is it with you?

52
00:03:15.030 --> 00:03:17.100
What don't you understand?

53
00:03:17.580 --> 00:03:18.413
<v 2>He's right.</v>

54
00:03:20.130 --> 00:03:24.810
<v 1>You got any idea about, Hey, it's distracting.</v>

55
00:03:24.960 --> 00:03:29.310
You got any idea about, Hey, it's distracting.

56
00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:33.660
<v 0>Worst sentence of all time. But still with them. I'm in dude. If I was there,</v>

57
00:03:33.720 --> 00:03:36.870
if I was Sam Worthington or whatever, cause this is on the Terminator movie,

58
00:03:36.871 --> 00:03:40.050
I would have been Sam. I would have been behind him like, wow. Yeah, dude.

59
00:03:40.170 --> 00:03:41.250
He's right. You know,

60
00:03:41.550 --> 00:03:45.840
do you have any idea about how distracting Sam Worthington?

61
00:03:45.900 --> 00:03:48.840
If you tried to draw Sam Worthington, you wouldn't know what to do.

62
00:03:49.020 --> 00:03:52.320
He's so famous, but Wu Izzy, you know,

63
00:03:54.750 --> 00:03:58.500
you'd be like, what is this nose do is he's just kind of regular, right?

64
00:03:58.560 --> 00:04:00.660
But he's in the biggest movies of all time.

65
00:04:01.340 --> 00:04:04.350
Then make a movie called Jesus Christ and he'll play Jesus Christ.

66
00:04:04.950 --> 00:04:09.690
<v 1>Having somebody walking up behind Bryce in the middle of the scene.</v>

67
00:04:10.980 --> 00:04:14.580
Give me a answer. What don't you get about it?

68
00:04:16.530 --> 00:04:17.850
<v 2>I was looking at the light.</v>

69
00:04:18.090 --> 00:04:21.960
<v 1>Oh, good for you. And the guy goes,</v>

70
00:04:22.500 --> 00:04:26.700
I was looking at the light. Oh, good for you.

71
00:04:27.660 --> 00:04:30.210
<v 0>Oh wow. So patronizing patronize, patronize.</v>

72
00:04:30.270 --> 00:04:32.040
It never known how to looking at the light.

73
00:04:32.160 --> 00:04:35.400
<v 1>Oh, good for you. And how was it</v>

74
00:04:40.140 --> 00:04:43.410
good for you and how was it?

75
00:04:44.850 --> 00:04:47.550
<v 0>Oh, wow. I can't wait if I let's see, what would I say? Well,</v>

76
00:04:47.551 --> 00:04:50.760
I was looking for the like, Oh, good for you. How was it? I'd be like, you know,

77
00:04:50.761 --> 00:04:55.140
it was fine, man. I, uh, I didn't, I didn't mean to get in, in the scene. He,

78
00:04:55.200 --> 00:04:56.160
as he eats gummy bears.

79
00:04:57.630 --> 00:05:00.600
<v 1>I hope he was good because it's useless now. Isn't it.</v>

80
00:05:00.660 --> 00:05:01.493
<v 2>Nice.</v>

81
00:05:04.500 --> 00:05:06.330
<v 1>Shake, man. You're amateur. Wow.</v>

82
00:05:11.130 --> 00:05:12.930
<v 0>This is the thing though. With actors, it's like,</v>

83
00:05:12.931 --> 00:05:15.150
he's doing a scene that's really intense.

84
00:05:15.151 --> 00:05:18.750
Obviously robots are trying to destroy the world and he's using that intensity

85
00:05:18.751 --> 00:05:20.100
and then a lighting guy does that.

86
00:05:20.550 --> 00:05:24.090
And then the dude Christian bale is just like using that intensity and people

87
00:05:24.091 --> 00:05:26.760
are like, what a dude. He's not, he's just acting, man.

88
00:05:28.260 --> 00:05:30.870
I'm going to play for real I'll dude,

89
00:05:31.530 --> 00:05:33.270
I'll be playing my Japanese guy or whatever,

90
00:05:33.271 --> 00:05:37.560
or the in a movie or a Christian or a Christian, a, a

91
00:05:40.020 --> 00:05:43.370
British dude. And then somebody will move a light and I'll just, I would do.

92
00:05:43.980 --> 00:05:47.100
<v 1>Oh, you really think you get to move a law.</v>

93
00:05:47.280 --> 00:05:49.920
<v 0>And I'll be like, well, Chris is a Dick, but why is he British? When he's Dick?</v>

94
00:05:50.010 --> 00:05:54.450
Like all he was playing, he was, it was that movie with Sherlock Holmes.

95
00:05:57.770 --> 00:05:59.990
<v 2>Um, cool. My computer's not working. That sounds great.</v>

96
00:06:01.480 --> 00:06:04.180
<v 1>Look, G you got something to say to this prick. Wow.</v>

97
00:06:05.350 --> 00:06:06.400
Well somebody should be stopped.

98
00:06:07.300 --> 00:06:10.780
<v 0>G dude. Miuccia you got something to say to this prick? He says,</v>

99
00:06:10.840 --> 00:06:15.760
I didn't see it happen. Oh dude. Now you know where G stands, dude. All right.

100
00:06:15.970 --> 00:06:19.510
Okay. Okay. Nobody went to his bro Christian bale.

101
00:06:19.810 --> 00:06:24.580
I would have been right there, dude. The jerky comedian, just.

102
00:06:29.080 --> 00:06:31.240
<v 1>Watching and keeping an eye on him. Fair enough.</v>

103
00:06:31.620 --> 00:06:35.860
Just second time that he doesn't give a about what is going on in front of the

104
00:06:36.280 --> 00:06:40.600
camera, dude. All right. I'm trying to do a scene here and I'm going,

105
00:06:41.260 --> 00:06:43.090
why the is Shane walking in there?

106
00:06:46.300 --> 00:06:50.830
<v 0>I'm trying to do a scene and I'm saying, what the is Shane walking in there?</v>

107
00:06:52.780 --> 00:06:56.350
<v 1>What is he doing there? Do you understand? My mind is not in the scene.</v>

108
00:06:56.351 --> 00:06:57.184
If you're doing that.

109
00:06:57.430 --> 00:06:58.263
<v 2>Yeah.</v>

110
00:07:01.240 --> 00:07:06.130
Stay off the set, man. Wow. sake. This is so funny. Yeah.

111
00:07:06.580 --> 00:07:08.290
<v 0>Stay off the set man.</v>

112
00:07:09.070 --> 00:07:13.600
Just so after the fit, just, you know what, man,

113
00:07:13.660 --> 00:07:18.460
stay off the set, man. Just got real, got down to brass tacks. You know?

114
00:07:19.630 --> 00:07:21.370
No, I don't care. I'm acting. Let's go again.

115
00:07:24.640 --> 00:07:28.630
<v 1>Nice. Not take a minute. Let's go again. And it's so funny when you.</v>

116
00:07:28.660 --> 00:07:33.400
<v 0>Get that heated, there's nothing you can do. Like he's like, Oh, let's go again.</v>

117
00:07:33.401 --> 00:07:35.170
And the guy says, well, we can take a minute. And he says,

118
00:07:35.171 --> 00:07:39.550
let's not take a minute. Like you can't suggest anything.

119
00:07:40.630 --> 00:07:43.210
You, he, the people could have been like, do you want a blow job?

120
00:07:43.211 --> 00:07:48.070
We have that Emily rata to Chelsea. No, I'm a guy. I'm a guy,

121
00:07:48.460 --> 00:07:53.360
a guys. I'd be like, okay, well we got Tyson Beckford then. And he'll. Nah,

122
00:07:53.361 --> 00:07:57.550
I just went back to comes again.

123
00:07:59.260 --> 00:08:01.000
Like you can't win.

124
00:08:02.380 --> 00:08:04.570
<v 1>And like to not have you walking in.</v>

125
00:08:07.180 --> 00:08:08.650
Can I have Tom put this on please?

126
00:08:10.000 --> 00:08:10.833
<v 2>Tom Joe.</v>

127
00:08:11.680 --> 00:08:15.310
<v 1>You're unbelievable, man. You're unfucking believable and stop.</v>

128
00:08:15.311 --> 00:08:19.000
It's the best number of times you're strolling the round in the background.

129
00:08:20.470 --> 00:08:21.850
I never had a DP behave like.

130
00:08:22.690 --> 00:08:23.523
<v 2>Wow.</v>

131
00:08:26.080 --> 00:08:29.380
<v 1>Uh, you don't understand what it's like working with actors.</v>

132
00:08:29.381 --> 00:08:33.670
That's what that is. That's what that is, man. I'm telling her, is it dude?

133
00:08:33.700 --> 00:08:36.490
Where is this? I'm not asking. I'm telling the way dude.

134
00:08:36.700 --> 00:08:38.380
And he wouldn't have done that. Otherwise.

135
00:08:40.240 --> 00:08:43.880
<v 0>Stop it, dude. I got them. Hate Mac computers, man. Where the is it? Here we go.</v>

136
00:08:43.910 --> 00:08:48.580
Got it. Got it. got it. When he said something and he's just like,

137
00:08:49.360 --> 00:08:53.260
eh, what does he say, I missed it. And now I've got to go back. God it.

138
00:08:54.670 --> 00:08:57.820
<v 1>You understand what it's like working with actors.</v>

139
00:08:58.130 --> 00:09:01.610
<v 0>Well, don't understand what it's like working with actors.</v>

140
00:09:02.600 --> 00:09:05.180
You don't understand the, I know there's no video of it,

141
00:09:05.270 --> 00:09:08.630
but I wa I hope you went like that. You went like this.

142
00:09:09.770 --> 00:09:13.490
You don't understand, you know how it is working with actors.

143
00:09:15.740 --> 00:09:19.040
<v 1>Uh, you don't understand what it's like working with actors.</v>

144
00:09:19.041 --> 00:09:22.820
That's what that is. That's what that is, man. I'm telling you,

145
00:09:24.050 --> 00:09:28.250
I'm not asking. I'm telling you, you wouldn't have done that otherwise.

146
00:09:32.000 --> 00:09:32.833
<v 2>Yeah.</v>

147
00:09:33.200 --> 00:09:37.010
<v 1>I want to kick your, you know, shut up for a second.</v>

148
00:09:37.250 --> 00:09:42.110
<v 0>Oh, he went after him doing the kick your. I was like, Whoa, come on,</v>

149
00:09:42.111 --> 00:09:43.730
come on. Wow, dude,

150
00:09:45.890 --> 00:09:50.360
what if he just got leveled? What if the dude just went, Oh man,

151
00:09:50.361 --> 00:09:53.000
another thing you could do is this. If a guy starts talking like that,

152
00:09:54.380 --> 00:09:56.060
if you're on gummy bears, you can just go like this.

153
00:10:00.140 --> 00:10:01.730
I bet that would what?

154
00:10:05.600 --> 00:10:05.930
<v 2>Okay.</v>
