00:00:03.800 --> 00:00:05.780
<v 1>Oh, you to look at some deserve at scale submissions.</v>

2
00:00:06.860 --> 00:00:10.280
You guys talking about these guys sent me some deserve at scale stuff about

3
00:00:10.281 --> 00:00:14.720
people who are high on the [inaudible] deserve it, deserve it scales so drunk.

4
00:00:16.850 --> 00:00:18.050
Um, let's look at some of these here.

5
00:00:23.990 --> 00:00:26.720
<v 0>I haven't looked at these yet. Wow.</v>

6
00:00:28.940 --> 00:00:30.260
<v 1>Oh, that's so funny. Dude.</v>

7
00:00:31.190 --> 00:00:34.880
Guy gets so mad walking at the person. I don't know why.

8
00:00:34.940 --> 00:00:39.800
And he's so mad and he walks into a pole. Looks like Santa,

9
00:00:39.801 --> 00:00:40.640
and he's so mad.

10
00:00:41.360 --> 00:00:44.660
So this is the classic example of someone taking something out on something.

11
00:00:44.720 --> 00:00:46.730
Someone, because something else happened. He's mad.

12
00:00:46.731 --> 00:00:47.990
This guy's walking across the car.

13
00:00:48.140 --> 00:00:51.410
He's yelling at the guy and he walks into a pole and after walks into a pole,

14
00:00:51.590 --> 00:00:54.350
he gets even more mad at the guy said this play.

15
00:01:01.040 --> 00:01:04.520
<v 0>Wow, love it.</v>

16
00:01:07.340 --> 00:01:08.173
I love it.

17
00:01:09.980 --> 00:01:13.130
<v 1>You're such a ho. I love it.</v>

18
00:01:13.850 --> 00:01:18.530
How come they can make music like that is such a, uh,

19
00:01:18.770 --> 00:01:21.440
I love it. And they'll

20
00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:25.700
all do it. Oh, you have you seen this one?

21
00:01:25.910 --> 00:01:28.430
<v 2>I caught up with Chelsea and Michael who are jogging by and we're nice to just</v>

22
00:01:28.431 --> 00:01:29.420
stop for a quick second.

23
00:01:29.630 --> 00:01:33.260
<v 1>Of all, this is already so boring.</v>

24
00:01:34.430 --> 00:01:39.300
Like don't catch up with anyone jogging, you know? Oh,

25
00:01:39.500 --> 00:01:43.100
go, you got, Oh, you got joggers opinions. Oh, hold up.

26
00:01:44.360 --> 00:01:46.160
Hey joggers, what do you think?

27
00:01:47.180 --> 00:01:51.620
How boring are joggers? So it's so snowy here.

28
00:01:52.010 --> 00:01:56.960
And this is the Metro weather somewhere. WSU, Vancouver, Vancouver,

29
00:01:57.110 --> 00:01:58.970
all Saturday events are canceled.

30
00:02:00.710 --> 00:02:03.800
So we're catching up with some joggers and they're still jogging even though

31
00:02:03.830 --> 00:02:04.910
it's snowing.

32
00:02:04.911 --> 00:02:09.890
So the deserve at scale is at an all time high because

33
00:02:09.891 --> 00:02:13.520
don't jog when everything is canceled because of weather.

34
00:02:14.060 --> 00:02:17.840
But these people are like, you know what? We've got swept up in the moment.

35
00:02:18.020 --> 00:02:21.740
We're the kind of guys that, that sleep without Capitano in Italy.

36
00:02:21.800 --> 00:02:25.220
We're the kind of guys that think burgers and Amsterdam are the best.

37
00:02:27.560 --> 00:02:30.260
<v 2>With Chelsea and Michael who were jogging by and were nice to just stop for a</v>

38
00:02:30.261 --> 00:02:32.150
quick second. And I said, what are you doing? Running?

39
00:02:32.151 --> 00:02:33.440
And you're saying it was really good out.

40
00:02:33.620 --> 00:02:35.750
It's the perfect texture for running very low.

41
00:02:36.410 --> 00:02:39.230
<v 1>You yoga teacher, dude,</v>

42
00:02:40.310 --> 00:02:45.170
are you me? You might as well have just said I don't eat meat knots.

43
00:02:45.171 --> 00:02:47.990
All I talk about because you're so annoying.

44
00:02:48.680 --> 00:02:53.420
The perfect texture for running the pur. First of all, honestly,

45
00:02:54.440 --> 00:02:58.040
anytime someone says the word texture is Eero, unless you're a,

46
00:02:58.930 --> 00:03:02.920
you lay tile, you're an. You know,

47
00:03:05.200 --> 00:03:10.120
the perfect texture for my guests is the perfect texture for face planting

48
00:03:10.510 --> 00:03:11.860
too. Cause I have a feeling that's, what's gonna be.

49
00:03:12.120 --> 00:03:14.850
<v 2>The perfect texture for running very low impact. And it's dry.</v>

50
00:03:14.880 --> 00:03:18.090
Let me guess if the cook agrees, let's see your feet, don't get wet.

51
00:03:18.660 --> 00:03:20.760
What have you seen while you've been out running? It's been a lot of fun.

52
00:03:20.761 --> 00:03:23.700
There's a lot of other runners and more skiers than runners. For sure.

53
00:03:23.701 --> 00:03:26.430
I think they've got a little bit of the advantage with the whole stride and

54
00:03:26.431 --> 00:03:29.040
glide thing, but it's too nice to not be out here. Yeah.

55
00:03:29.580 --> 00:03:32.130
<v 1>Dude, it's snowing.</v>

56
00:03:35.070 --> 00:03:36.210
It's snowing, man.

57
00:03:39.390 --> 00:03:42.600
<v 2>It's incredible though. Just to see even people still on their bicycles. Yeah.</v>

58
00:03:42.630 --> 00:03:44.550
I don't know how they do it with the bikes like breaking.

59
00:03:45.030 --> 00:03:49.020
<v 1>Well, you're doing it running. Just go inside, man. Watch Seinfeld.</v>

60
00:03:49.560 --> 00:03:51.540
<v 2>Well, at least we can control, you know, worst case.</v>

61
00:03:51.750 --> 00:03:53.640
We can just fly right through a stop sign and.

62
00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:54.870
<v 1>This case, dude,</v>

63
00:03:54.990 --> 00:03:59.700
this guy it's so high on the dessert scale because it's snowing and he's talking

64
00:03:59.701 --> 00:03:59.941
about,

65
00:03:59.941 --> 00:04:02.880
they're talking about how the texture's good for running and they want to be,

66
00:04:03.060 --> 00:04:05.370
you know what, it. We're not going to let the weather hold us back.

67
00:04:05.400 --> 00:04:06.750
Even though it's not safe to do it.

68
00:04:07.050 --> 00:04:12.000
And also he's being so cocky about it. I mean,

69
00:04:12.001 --> 00:04:14.730
listen to the saying, look, you know.

70
00:04:15.090 --> 00:04:18.000
<v 2>No how they do it with the bikes, like breaking, at least we can control,</v>

71
00:04:18.001 --> 00:04:19.560
you know, worst case. We can just.

72
00:04:20.310 --> 00:04:22.380
<v 1>The bikers a little bit of, Hey man, got to give them credit.</v>

73
00:04:22.381 --> 00:04:26.520
Even though he thinks deep down, he's getting the credit. You know what I mean?

74
00:04:26.980 --> 00:04:28.170
Cause it's like, he he's like,

75
00:04:28.171 --> 00:04:31.350
let me just like pass off the credit to the bikers who really are the heroes.

76
00:04:32.040 --> 00:04:35.610
This guy knows people. The, the,

77
00:04:35.611 --> 00:04:39.600
the people who are like the, the followers are going to be like, well,

78
00:04:40.080 --> 00:04:43.230
you know, but you're the real hero. You don't even use a bike though.

79
00:04:43.340 --> 00:04:44.131
I'll tell you. And that's the hard thing.

80
00:04:44.131 --> 00:04:46.230
And this guy knows that those people are out there.

81
00:04:46.500 --> 00:04:49.350
So this is their dessert scale is off the charts, dude.

82
00:04:50.460 --> 00:04:53.010
<v 2>Their bicycles. Yeah. I don't know how they do it with the bikes.</v>

83
00:04:54.330 --> 00:04:55.440
<v 1>Because then he thinks we're going to think, well,</v>

84
00:04:55.441 --> 00:04:56.760
we don't know how you do it without the bikes.

85
00:04:57.120 --> 00:04:58.370
<v 2>Well, at least we can control. You know,</v>

86
00:04:58.371 --> 00:05:01.860
I can just fly right through a stop sign and we'll be okay.

87
00:05:01.980 --> 00:05:04.770
Cause we're pretty visible at night. I surprise you the snow,

88
00:05:06.470 --> 00:05:08.430
this much of it. I think when we woke up this morning,

89
00:05:08.431 --> 00:05:10.530
we were definitely surprised by how much there was,

90
00:05:10.531 --> 00:05:12.990
there was sort of joking that it was a nice dusting,

91
00:05:12.991 --> 00:05:16.980
but the reality is is this is a, this is a real chunk of snow getting hurt.

92
00:05:17.220 --> 00:05:18.510
<v 1>Let me just tell you, let me just ask you right now.</v>

93
00:05:18.511 --> 00:05:20.610
If you're listening to this right now and not watching it on the video.

94
00:05:21.150 --> 00:05:22.440
Guess if these people are white.

95
00:05:25.500 --> 00:05:28.380
<v 2>In France money. Yeah, no kidding. Yeah. We're both California kids.</v>

96
00:05:28.381 --> 00:05:31.320
So we haven't had many snow days in our lives. This is pretty exciting.

97
00:05:31.830 --> 00:05:33.960
We'll go ahead and keep it on the run. I started to have kept you,

98
00:05:33.961 --> 00:05:36.510
but I appreciate you guys talking with us. All right. Thanks.

99
00:05:36.810 --> 00:05:40.260
Can we seen a lot of people out here? Like you said, running sledding,

100
00:05:40.261 --> 00:05:44.970
just enjoying it. Oops. That can happen. Unfortunate.

101
00:05:46.140 --> 00:05:48.180
<v 1>And she ate.</v>

102
00:05:51.660 --> 00:05:56.520
Oops. That can happen, unfortunately. Ah, okay. Thanks scientists.

103
00:05:57.220 --> 00:05:58.010
So we've seen a lot of.

104
00:05:58.010 --> 00:06:02.060
<v 2>People out here, like you said, running sledding, just enjoying it. One thing.</v>

105
00:06:02.090 --> 00:06:05.360
Oops. That can happen. Unfortunately.

106
00:06:05.500 --> 00:06:10.030
<v 1>Dude, the background is so sad. I feel bad actually,</v>

107
00:06:10.360 --> 00:06:11.710
because she looked like she hurt. I wish he fell.

108
00:06:12.520 --> 00:06:13.570
I don't like when the girl falls.

109
00:06:13.720 --> 00:06:16.630
<v 2>Kept you, but I appreciate you guys talking with us. All right. Thanks.</v>

110
00:06:16.930 --> 00:06:20.380
So we've seen a lot of people out here, like you said, running sledding,

111
00:06:20.410 --> 00:06:24.430
just enjoying it. One thing, oops. That can happen.

112
00:06:28.600 --> 00:06:33.490
<v 1>I love the well of course, behind the oops in the,</v>

113
00:06:33.491 --> 00:06:36.810
in the newscaster. Oops, oops.

114
00:06:38.130 --> 00:06:42.400
And that can happen. Knew these people were idiots and you can tell,

115
00:06:45.370 --> 00:06:47.410
listen to that. Oops. How much she knew.

116
00:06:49.050 --> 00:06:52.120
<v 2>Sorry to have kept you, but I appreciate you guys talking with us. All right.</v>

117
00:06:52.121 --> 00:06:56.230
Thanks. So we've seen a lot of people out here, like you said, running sledding,

118
00:06:56.231 --> 00:07:00.250
just enjoying it. One thing. Oops. That can happen.

119
00:07:01.010 --> 00:07:05.290
<v 1>God, you know that hoops is great. Let's look at you. Two comments.</v>

120
00:07:05.291 --> 00:07:10.240
One of my favorite things. Oh look, how do you like the texture now? Siddiq.

121
00:07:13.720 --> 00:07:18.010
Oh wow. People are crazy. Huh? Camera man is. Oh gee.

122
00:07:18.011 --> 00:07:22.840
For continuing to film them. It's actually funny because I did think about like,

123
00:07:22.841 --> 00:07:24.610
well that's odd how he's filming him for so long.

124
00:07:27.250 --> 00:07:28.450
<v 0>Dry snow. You know.</v>

125
00:07:29.710 --> 00:07:34.210
<v 1>When people say dry snow, Hey, do you know what snow is? Water.</v>

126
00:07:37.090 --> 00:07:39.340
Here's another one deserve at scale. Let's see what this one is.

127
00:07:41.200 --> 00:07:45.370
I've never seen this one. Okay. Guy is running full speed at night.

128
00:07:45.820 --> 00:07:46.720
First of all,

129
00:07:47.320 --> 00:07:51.400
never run full speed at night because you can't say all right.

130
00:07:52.030 --> 00:07:54.850
Who running? I mean, this guy is running full speed.

131
00:07:54.880 --> 00:07:57.580
Oh he's streaking in the quad or he's at school.

132
00:08:06.190 --> 00:08:10.090
<v 0>Right in the glass. Like he's a Yorkie right in the glass.</v>

133
00:08:11.890 --> 00:08:14.290
<v 1>Like he's a dog. Like you said.</v>

134
00:08:14.830 --> 00:08:15.663
<v 0>Go.</v>

135
00:08:19.480 --> 00:08:24.460
<v 1>Oh, full speed. I had into the glass look. I mean,</v>

136
00:08:25.180 --> 00:08:29.410
you know, what's, so not funny. Streaking you just like.

137
00:08:36.790 --> 00:08:37.000
<v 0>Yeah.</v>

138
00:08:37.000 --> 00:08:39.460
<v 1>The people in the court it's like a tennis court.</v>

139
00:08:39.490 --> 00:08:41.050
He was going to try and run through the tennis court.

140
00:08:41.051 --> 00:08:45.280
But there was glass and people in there were just like, what the is this doing?

141
00:08:45.580 --> 00:08:50.290
Like, so didn't give him a reaction. Wow.

142
00:08:51.460 --> 00:08:52.293
<v 0>What's your.</v>

143
00:08:56.990 --> 00:09:01.020
<v 1>Well, I already love this one. Oh wow. Okay. So when someone thinks they're bad,</v>

144
00:09:01.200 --> 00:09:02.820
that's the best. So this guy

145
00:09:09.950 --> 00:09:13.670
Camera on him just filming his buddy walking

146
00:09:22.100 --> 00:09:26.840
And he's dancing a little bit. Oh no. Does he get hit by a car? Oh,

147
00:09:26.841 --> 00:09:27.674
I can't watch this.

148
00:09:34.550 --> 00:09:35.990
I mean, he's doing like dancing.

149
00:09:41.240 --> 00:09:45.860
Okay. Don't watch that one because the guy maybe died.

150
00:09:46.940 --> 00:09:50.630
Hey Debbie didn't die. But also don't look at that one. That one was so,

151
00:09:51.800 --> 00:09:54.140
they gotta be funny guys. I mean, w who you say?

152
00:09:54.380 --> 00:09:58.100
<v 0>I think long and hard do what you gotta do to make it go right in the bad guy.</v>

153
00:09:58.370 --> 00:10:01.790
<v 1>Oh, I've seen this one. She rockets the thing she's pulling back.</v>

154
00:10:01.791 --> 00:10:04.370
The catapult thing. It goes right in the guy's face.

155
00:10:05.840 --> 00:10:07.940
<v 0>Her face. I'm not kidding.</v>

156
00:10:09.390 --> 00:10:14.210
<v 1>Like, why is this thing taking watermelons?</v>

157
00:10:14.270 --> 00:10:15.380
Catapulting them across.
