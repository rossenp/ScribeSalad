00:00:01.110 --> 00:00:05.550
<v 0>I love these, uh, what do you call it? The, um, the,</v>

2
00:00:05.770 --> 00:00:09.660
the like finales and. Like they bring out the,

3
00:00:10.950 --> 00:00:15.600
like, anytime a show ends, like, it's weird. How, like,

4
00:00:15.990 --> 00:00:19.950
so after it, it's like

5
00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:24.990
the, during the show of, of whatever,

6
00:00:25.110 --> 00:00:27.660
your talk of whatever you're talking about. Star Wars, game of Thrones,

7
00:00:27.661 --> 00:00:32.280
anything is like, during it, you don't realize how dorky it is.

8
00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:34.980
And then afterwards you really realize how dark it is.

9
00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:40.230
So like I'm on season five of game of Thrones. I don't, I don't, you know,

10
00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:42.060
I don't, I don't, I'm not caught up,

11
00:00:42.150 --> 00:00:46.170
but I know that finale was obviously this past weekend and

12
00:00:48.150 --> 00:00:50.130
people are upset with the way it is. First of all,

13
00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:55.050
it's so hard to sustain a show for eight seasons. Okay.

14
00:00:57.210 --> 00:00:58.043
Um,

15
00:00:58.590 --> 00:01:02.340
I know that because every show I've been on has been canceled after three or

16
00:01:02.341 --> 00:01:06.390
two. Okay. But, um.

17
00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:09.450
<v 1>There's.</v>

18
00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:14.430
<v 0>Petition, there's a petition to redo</v>

19
00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:18.570
the last season of game of Thrones.

20
00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:21.450
Like, look that up.

21
00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:26.160
Sophie Turner slams fan petitioned to remake game of Thrones, season eight.

22
00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:27.060

00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:35.370

26
00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:43.193
look

27
00:01:45.660 --> 00:01:49.410

Oh, you're you're off.

32
00:02:07.760 --> 00:02:12.380

protesting about the Lakers management. Hey, you're the first to go.

36
00:02:29.570 --> 00:02:33.410
They're not going to remake seasons of game of Thrones.

37
00:02:34.820 --> 00:02:36.650
They're not going to make another episode.

38
00:02:36.651 --> 00:02:38.660
Maybe in 10 years they might make a prequel or some.

39
00:02:40.610 --> 00:02:45.230
But do they're not going to make a a million people signed it.

And you say, well, you're the you're on the frontline dude.

49
00:03:27.480 --> 00:03:30.030
You're not going to be making decisions.

50
00:03:31.050 --> 00:03:33.840

74

00:06:36.130 --> 00:06:40.150
<v 0>You didn't even give him a helmet. No, I know. He's just a, he's a, Oh God.</v>

92
00:06:40.200 --> 00:06:40.751
You know why?

93
00:06:40.751 --> 00:06:45.250
It's cause he's a idiot and he's the biggest glasses pushing up.

94
00:06:45.700 --> 00:06:49.090
Dork of all he's from the thing is dude, he was the mayor of dorks, Phil.

95
00:06:49.110 --> 00:06:53.560
That's why that's what happened. He was the mayor.

96
00:06:53.560 --> 00:06:55.930
<v 1>Of, of cucks.</v>

97
00:06:55.930 --> 00:06:57.310
<v 0>Landing. That's why,</v>

98
00:07:01.030 --> 00:07:02.470
I mean, do it come on, man.

99
00:07:04.780 --> 00:07:06.220
I don't like what they did to dinner.

100
00:07:06.430 --> 00:07:09.340
It's she was the hero for 90% of the series. And you know, it's like,

101
00:07:09.670 --> 00:07:10.750
this makes me laugh. How.

102
00:07:14.350 --> 00:07:15.070
<v 1>Okay.</v>

103
00:07:15.070 --> 00:07:19.660
<v 0>I just don't like, you know, it's like, it's like scroll up.</v>

104
00:07:20.120 --> 00:07:21.340
So we get another one here. You know,

105
00:07:21.370 --> 00:07:23.950
it's like even the writer sent through the final season was it was supposed to

106
00:07:23.951 --> 00:07:26.440
be the fact that there are almost 1.5 million people signed.

107
00:07:30.100 --> 00:07:30.130
<v 1>Okay.</v>

108
00:07:30.130 --> 00:07:33.850
<v 0>That's the guy looking for his arm and saving private Ryan. That's that guy.</v>

109
00:07:34.060 --> 00:07:34.893
That's what he's saying.

110
00:07:35.050 --> 00:07:38.110
The earlier seasons were magical because the writers were had, you know,

111
00:07:38.170 --> 00:07:41.230
all the published books and worked for references and is actually poorly

112
00:07:41.260 --> 00:07:44.560
written. It rushed with abandoned storyline arcs. And that's the,

113
00:07:44.610 --> 00:07:46.210
that's what the guy's saying,

114
00:07:46.300 --> 00:07:51.250
looking for his arm on the opening scenes and that when you're storming the

115
00:07:51.251 --> 00:07:53.800
beaches of Normandy, when it's the woman, the beach in Normandy

116
00:07:56.440 --> 00:07:57.273
and the, uh,

117
00:07:57.550 --> 00:08:01.540
in the saving private Ryan movie did how,

118
00:08:01.840 --> 00:08:05.590
how dorky was it when people were thought it was funny to say saving, Hey,

119
00:08:05.591 --> 00:08:07.360
have you seen saving Ryan's privates?

120
00:08:09.250 --> 00:08:10.180
<v 1>Yo dude.</v>

121
00:08:10.210 --> 00:08:11.800
<v 0>There's a porno named of that for sure.</v>
