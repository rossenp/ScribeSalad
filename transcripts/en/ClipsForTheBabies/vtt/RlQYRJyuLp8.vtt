00:00:01.200 --> 00:00:05.850
<v 0>I was thinking about this man. I was thinking about,</v>

2
00:00:06.360 --> 00:00:10.140
I was in a conversation with a bunch of people who was I talking about this with

3
00:00:11.250 --> 00:00:14.610
about like Dan Bilzerian, that guy that does all the, um,

4
00:00:15.660 --> 00:00:18.120
flying around with the chicks.

5
00:00:20.190 --> 00:00:21.810
Like I was thinking about that.

6
00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:25.080
And I was thinking about how that's quote unquote, every guy's fantasy, right.

7
00:00:25.081 --> 00:00:30.060
To just have, you know, 10 chicks around or the, you know,

8
00:00:30.061 --> 00:00:31.260
the Hugh Hefner thing. Right?

9
00:00:31.290 --> 00:00:35.910
Like where you just got 10 chicks and you just around there around,

10
00:00:35.911 --> 00:00:39.630
and you're just always around them and all that. And I was thinking about like,

11
00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:44.670
if they had that choice, like, like, like here's the thing, dude,

12
00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:47.820
having sex with a bunch of different women. Sure.

13
00:00:47.821 --> 00:00:52.410
That's I understand that want that's cool and that's can be hot and it's great.

14
00:00:52.411 --> 00:00:53.244
Whatever,

15
00:00:54.390 --> 00:00:57.930
but what's up with this guy though.

16
00:00:58.500 --> 00:00:59.910
What's up with,

17
00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:04.170
and the guy seems happy and and no knock on the dude,

18
00:01:04.200 --> 00:01:09.180
the guy's doing what he wants to do, but you,

19
00:01:09.660 --> 00:01:13.680
this guy is not doing that. He's like, you gotta, Oh,

20
00:01:13.681 --> 00:01:17.820
you gotta be on a plane with them for six hours.

21
00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:19.051
Like,

22
00:01:19.051 --> 00:01:23.310
that's the thing that I don't get like this guy's always chilling with them

23
00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:27.600
and I'm not saying it's not fun to be around 10 chicks.

24
00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:33.120
I'm saying it's not fun to be around 10 thoughts.

25
00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:38.520
It's not it's it's, it's not.

26
00:01:39.160 --> 00:01:42.540
And maybe there's something wrong with me. Okay. Like,

27
00:01:43.230 --> 00:01:47.520
but like if Dan and he would never,

28
00:01:47.521 --> 00:01:51.900
because I'm boring as. But if he asked me to be like, yo,

29
00:01:51.930 --> 00:01:54.390
we're going to New York, get on the private jet.

30
00:01:54.990 --> 00:01:59.970
These 12 thoughts are going to come with us. I would be like, Oh bro, I can't,

31
00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:03.750
I can't go dude. And then he would be like,

32
00:02:03.870 --> 00:02:07.890
but look at the girls. And I would be like, yeah,

33
00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:12.690
but they're going to talk and stuff. What are I'd say? Yeah.

34
00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:15.360
But what are we going to talk about?

35
00:02:21.440 --> 00:02:22.880
<v 1>What are we going to say?</v>

36
00:02:27.170 --> 00:02:31.340
<v 0>I get one, I get having sex with all of the girls is fun,</v>

37
00:02:32.510 --> 00:02:34.880
but then they're all at your house.

38
00:02:38.300 --> 00:02:42.890
And they're like, where did I put my in? You're like, Oh,

39
00:02:42.950 --> 00:02:46.220
I don't know. And the girl's like, you're always losing.

40
00:02:47.240 --> 00:02:49.460
And then the other one's like, well, um, hello.

41
00:02:50.180 --> 00:02:53.120
People just think I should be a comedian because like I'm always losing stuff

42
00:02:53.240 --> 00:02:55.910
and I'm movie just commenting on it. And then another girl was like,

43
00:02:55.911 --> 00:02:56.840
you should be.

44
00:02:58.460 --> 00:03:03.100
And they just have shirt on and I gotta be like, yeah,

45
00:03:03.640 --> 00:03:08.200
you should be a comedian. Or what, what or what, what do I say to that?

46
00:03:09.340 --> 00:03:13.990
If I'm in that situation, I go like this. Hey, Hey, Hey, Hey, no,

47
00:03:21.240 --> 00:03:26.010
I just don't. I don't get it. I don't get that life. I wish. And I, like I said,

48
00:03:26.011 --> 00:03:30.210
no, knock on the dude. And the chicks are, they're having fun. He's having fun.

49
00:03:30.211 --> 00:03:33.780
That's great. You know, it's like me. I don't want to go to a football game.

50
00:03:33.960 --> 00:03:35.980
You know? I'm not, I'm not,

51
00:03:36.060 --> 00:03:40.080
I'm never going to look at another guy running with a ball and actually be like,

52
00:03:40.860 --> 00:03:43.590
you. Like I whooped for what?

53
00:03:44.730 --> 00:03:48.000
He went to the place. He went to the end.

54
00:03:51.280 --> 00:03:54.240
[inaudible] see. He doesn't even know who I am. I don't give a.

55
00:03:56.910 --> 00:03:59.970
I get busted in common, but hanging.

56
00:04:02.280 --> 00:04:04.860

57
00:04:06.300 --> 00:04:07.620

59
00:04:13.470 --> 00:04:15.840
but on a plane to New York.

60
00:04:18.940 --> 00:04:19.773
<v 1>Okay.</v>

61
00:04:22.980 --> 00:04:26.910

62
00:04:26.970 --> 00:04:30.690
I th I, I think a lot of guys would not choose that. Right?

63
00:04:31.350 --> 00:04:33.960
W w I want to know what kind of guy would go on that trip.

64
00:04:40.140 --> 00:04:43.200
The girls are hot, dude. They're all real hot. Not, you know,

65
00:04:43.320 --> 00:04:47.250

But do it just because they're fake doesn't mean they're bad. Yeah.
