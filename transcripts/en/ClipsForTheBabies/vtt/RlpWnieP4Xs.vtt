Just clicked on it, turned into a checkmark, go do that now.

And watch it on April 14th. Now I'm going to do, what is April 14th? Is that,

16
00:01:01.840 --> 00:01:03.800
uh, well, I don't know what day that is, but I'm gonna,

00:01:05.300 --> 00:01:08.870
I want you guys all to watch it that day. It's going to come out, you know,

18
00:01:08.900 --> 00:01:10.850
and we're all gonna, you know, I can tell you,

19
00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:15.320
I'm going to go crazy on Twitter babies. I'm going to tweet you back that day.

20
00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:19.760
And, uh, it's a Tuesday, so I'll drop the podcast on that day. Maybe man,

21
00:01:19.850 --> 00:01:22.640
I'll drop the podcast the day before. I'll remind you that the coming.

22
00:01:25.310 --> 00:01:30.290
Uh, but no pain, April 14th, Netflix. And I will say

23
00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:35.660
I I've seen it. I did it. I was there when I shot it.

24
00:01:36.260 --> 00:01:40.520
Obviously it was me. It's the best special I've done. Uh,

25
00:01:40.550 --> 00:01:44.210
it's the best taping I've had. Um,

26
00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:49.490
I did white male black comic in on, uh, in, um,

27
00:01:50.420 --> 00:01:53.150
for comedy central. To me that always has a special place in my heart.

28
00:01:53.151 --> 00:01:57.020
That was my first one. All the decks. The deck was stacked. I had the,

29
00:01:57.290 --> 00:02:00.980
I was this young gun coming up. I was ready to do a special,

30
00:02:01.100 --> 00:02:04.010
I had this idea where I know what's funny. I got this.

31
00:02:04.011 --> 00:02:07.220
This is what's funny to me. And I, I felt really good about it.

32
00:02:07.670 --> 00:02:10.250
That was a great special, I think for me,

33
00:02:10.460 --> 00:02:11.780
I'm not saying whether or not it was great,

34
00:02:11.781 --> 00:02:14.780
but I'm saying for me was a great special, I'm not trying to toot my own horn,

35
00:02:14.781 --> 00:02:19.310
but for me, I, for me, it was, it was great.

36
00:02:19.550 --> 00:02:22.340
I felt great about it. It came out great. I loved it.

37
00:02:22.940 --> 00:02:26.180
I hired my dad to direct it. Kept it in the fam. It was awesome.

38
00:02:26.210 --> 00:02:29.450
I was so Italian about it. I kept it in the family. Dude.

39
00:02:31.040 --> 00:02:34.670
I should have called the special spaghetti and meatballs,

40
00:02:35.120 --> 00:02:39.110
but instead I decided to go with white male black comic. It was so Italian.

41
00:02:39.111 --> 00:02:43.610
I kept it in the family. My mom came out, my mom came out, sat in the audience.

42
00:02:43.790 --> 00:02:46.070
I kept it in the family. It's like,

43
00:02:46.071 --> 00:02:50.570
my last name was Dawn's polio or some, but it's still,

44
00:02:50.571 --> 00:02:54.170
it's still Italian. But anyway, should've called it spaghetti and meatballs,

45
00:02:54.200 --> 00:02:58.730
but I didn't. And then I did a second special incorrigible.

46
00:02:58.731 --> 00:03:02.260
That was first Netflix special. Now I like this special,

47
00:03:02.350 --> 00:03:06.670
but to me it was all the stuff that I still thought was funny that I didn't put

48
00:03:06.730 --> 00:03:10.300
on white male, black comic. So to me, white male,

49
00:03:10.301 --> 00:03:11.500
black comic was like the bang and.

50
00:03:12.130 --> 00:03:14.740
And then in cordial was the stuff that was like the odds and ends.

51
00:03:14.741 --> 00:03:16.870
It was like the B side of what my black comic.

52
00:03:16.990 --> 00:03:20.740
And I also think that the best stuff in incorrigible was at the end.

53
00:03:21.010 --> 00:03:23.800
And that was by design. Because as a comic, you put your good.

54
00:03:24.070 --> 00:03:27.490
At the end of the closer, the landscape has changed since then,

55
00:03:27.610 --> 00:03:29.950
because that special was about an hour and 20 minutes.

56
00:03:30.040 --> 00:03:32.890
Now that's too long for a special, I didn't think about that back then,

57
00:03:32.891 --> 00:03:35.590
because that was like the 20th Netflix special that they ever made.

58
00:03:36.040 --> 00:03:37.630
And I realized that people were watching the shorter,

59
00:03:37.930 --> 00:03:40.150
cause they don't want to invest their time, watching the best stuff.

60
00:03:40.240 --> 00:03:41.500
And incorrigible is at the end.

61
00:03:41.650 --> 00:03:45.910
And I know that a lot of people checked out of it because the beginning of it,

62
00:03:46.270 --> 00:03:48.310
people always reference the beginning of it and that's not the good.

63
00:03:48.790 --> 00:03:50.950
And I get all bummed because I'm like, ah, you didn't watch it.

64
00:03:51.220 --> 00:03:53.560
People are watching 30 minutes of the special. I know that.

65
00:03:53.680 --> 00:03:57.790
So man on fi so incorrigible is, is fine. I liked it,

66
00:03:59.110 --> 00:04:04.090
man, on fire to me. Oh. And by the way, in cordial, the taping went great. Okay,

67
00:04:04.570 --> 00:04:07.240
man, on fire to me was top loaded.

68
00:04:07.300 --> 00:04:11.290
I put the bang and up front because I knew now that there was this way that

69
00:04:11.291 --> 00:04:13.510
Netflix and the streaming services were doing it,

70
00:04:14.140 --> 00:04:19.090
that you were watching the first part to check

71
00:04:19.091 --> 00:04:22.600
it out. So I put the bang and up front the first twenty-five minutes. Dang,

72
00:04:22.750 --> 00:04:26.140
dang, dang, dang. Dang. Right. Okay. And then I,

73
00:04:26.350 --> 00:04:31.060
and then I end it with a nice sweet story that, you know, to me, it was very,

74
00:04:31.120 --> 00:04:33.580
for me, it meant a lot in my life. At that time,

75
00:04:33.850 --> 00:04:38.740
man on fire was my best material. For sure. To me,

76
00:04:39.160 --> 00:04:43.840
hands down. Now there were technical difficulties shooting, the special,

77
00:04:43.841 --> 00:04:46.900
the mic cutout. I had to redo some stuff. The audience was,

78
00:04:47.500 --> 00:04:51.100
it sounds good in the, in the, in the special,

79
00:04:51.520 --> 00:04:54.850
but the audience was okay. So I was really trying to bring it,

80
00:04:54.851 --> 00:04:57.640
but not too hard for the audience because you never want to bring it too hard

81
00:04:57.641 --> 00:05:01.090
for the level of the audience. You want to, some,

82
00:05:01.360 --> 00:05:03.670
you want to kind of meet the audience halfway.

83
00:05:04.060 --> 00:05:07.540
Sometimes the energy comes in and it's not popping and it's not unimportant and

84
00:05:07.630 --> 00:05:08.470
you gotta make it on and popping.

85
00:05:08.471 --> 00:05:11.560
But you can't go in with this unimportant energy right off the bat.

86
00:05:11.740 --> 00:05:15.370
If the inner, if the, if the audience is not there, so you gotta take it,

87
00:05:15.371 --> 00:05:17.530
you gotta meet the audience. You gotta go like this. Hello audience,

88
00:05:17.710 --> 00:05:20.590
shake hands with who the audience is. Come on into my study.

89
00:05:20.950 --> 00:05:23.530
Let's read a little bit about what's going on and then let's go into the

90
00:05:23.531 --> 00:05:26.260
kitchen. Oh, the food's good though. Isn't it? Yeah. Well,

91
00:05:26.261 --> 00:05:29.590
why don't you come into the and sucking room? Oh, you didn't know. We had that,

92
00:05:29.620 --> 00:05:30.790
but now it's unemployment.

93
00:05:31.420 --> 00:05:35.680
You got to start with the foil and then you got to take them in to the study.

94
00:05:35.681 --> 00:05:38.050
You got to show them your book collection. Huh? Very nice. Okay, cool.

95
00:05:38.051 --> 00:05:39.910
This is the audience. Oh, okay. Very cool. Oh, I like this.

96
00:05:39.950 --> 00:05:41.800
I've read that before you take them into the kitchen.

97
00:05:41.890 --> 00:05:43.810
You give him a little bit of hors d'oeuvres and they're like, wow,

98
00:05:43.811 --> 00:05:45.850
this is very tasty. Wow. Okay. Very cool. That's cool.

99
00:05:45.851 --> 00:05:47.650
You show me your study and while the foil wasn't pressing,

100
00:05:48.070 --> 00:05:52.000
it was it wasn't precedent. Now all of a sudden here's the and sucking room.

101
00:05:52.930 --> 00:05:56.950
That's what you're always trying to get to in a special is the and sucking room.

102
00:05:56.990 --> 00:06:01.040
But the audience is not always there for and sucking. You got to convince them,

103
00:06:02.030 --> 00:06:03.770
Oh, you're here for the and sucking orange yet.

104
00:06:04.070 --> 00:06:06.770
Sometimes there's 50 year old Mormons in your audience. Oh,

105
00:06:06.771 --> 00:06:09.770
I don't know about that. Well, let me convince you about the and sucking room.

106
00:06:10.520 --> 00:06:11.353
Okay.

107
00:06:12.560 --> 00:06:16.160
So what happens is the whole time my man on fire,

108
00:06:16.220 --> 00:06:19.310
I was trying to convince this audience to come with me to the and sucking room.

109
00:06:19.311 --> 00:06:21.050
And a lot of people were on board,

110
00:06:21.230 --> 00:06:24.710
but some of them were just there for a jolly good time, whatever. That's fine,

111
00:06:24.711 --> 00:06:27.560
dude. They want it to hang out in the foyer and mingle and have an order.

112
00:06:27.860 --> 00:06:31.880
And that's fine too, because you could have a good time nor d'oeuvres,

113
00:06:32.420 --> 00:06:35.660
but that's like that conversational. That's like, that was like, Oh wow.

114
00:06:35.690 --> 00:06:36.530
Last night was really fun.

115
00:06:36.531 --> 00:06:40.100
But was it fun or did you really just kick it and learn some stuff?

116
00:06:40.460 --> 00:06:43.970
Did you really just have great conversation? Reacting like an adult now?

117
00:06:43.971 --> 00:06:47.060
You know me, that's not my vibe. I don't sit there and act like an adult.

118
00:06:47.061 --> 00:06:49.520
Not all night long. I'm done for and sucking.

119
00:06:50.600 --> 00:06:52.070
So I'm going to be in the second room.

120
00:06:52.071 --> 00:06:53.450
You guys hang out with the hors d'oeuvres,

121
00:06:53.600 --> 00:06:56.480
that's what it was like for manna fire, but it was my best material.

122
00:06:57.950 --> 00:07:02.090
And you can't tell when you're watching the special. So that's that.

123
00:07:03.110 --> 00:07:07.040
So white male black comic up until no pain, white belt.

124
00:07:07.130 --> 00:07:10.040
Let me say I'm leaving no pain out of this. White, my black comic best special.

125
00:07:10.520 --> 00:07:15.140
All the cards fell where they may, all the deck was stacked.

126
00:07:15.140 --> 00:07:18.800
I should say the stars fell and aligned. Okay.

127
00:07:19.850 --> 00:07:24.320
Incorrigible, great taping. But the odds and ends of Blackwell, blackmail,

128
00:07:24.321 --> 00:07:27.860
white comic, this stuff I left out. So then I was like, okay,

129
00:07:29.240 --> 00:07:32.570
w ma man on fire, best, best material.

130
00:07:32.600 --> 00:07:36.380
However audience they were in order of audience.

131
00:07:36.590 --> 00:07:39.440
Some of them were there for and sucking, but your boy wasn't going to drag him.

132
00:07:39.560 --> 00:07:42.650
So we had a nice conversation, no pain.

133
00:07:44.030 --> 00:07:48.020
I decided I'm going to go for broke best material to me,

134
00:07:48.021 --> 00:07:50.480
best material I've done. Now, this is the whole deal. You get you, you,

135
00:07:50.930 --> 00:07:54.500
you grow for me. Best material, the audience,

136
00:07:55.700 --> 00:07:57.350
bro, the audience.

137
00:07:58.460 --> 00:08:00.860
It was like they just came in in shorts.

138
00:08:01.490 --> 00:08:06.350
They were down for sucking and right away. The audience,

139
00:08:06.440 --> 00:08:10.640
the first audience I shot great. Walked off the stage.

140
00:08:10.700 --> 00:08:12.830
My agent goes like this. Well, we don't even need to, we don't need to.

141
00:08:12.890 --> 00:08:17.090
We need to, uh, do the second taping. The second taping.

142
00:08:17.810 --> 00:08:21.320
First five minutes in, I was like, Oh man, this is the taping.

143
00:08:21.321 --> 00:08:22.610
We don't even need that first audience.

144
00:08:22.700 --> 00:08:26.900
So the first audience came from and sucking. The second audience came.

145
00:08:28.400 --> 00:08:31.790
I mean, you know, whatever's on the top of higher than in second.

146
00:08:31.791 --> 00:08:36.470
But my point is the material, the audience. And guess what, dude,

147
00:08:37.280 --> 00:08:41.780
I fired my dad from shooting it. I fired him. He's my dad.

148
00:08:41.781 --> 00:08:44.780
And I fired him. I fired him. I took him. I hired him on the second,

149
00:08:44.781 --> 00:08:49.520
on the first episode, thanking him for my whole childhood con. Congratulations.

150
00:08:49.521 --> 00:08:53.720
You're welcome. I've given you a job. Sure. I only gave you $7,000 to do it,

151
00:08:53.990 --> 00:08:55.800
but this makes up for everything you've done.

152
00:08:57.180 --> 00:08:59.370
The second one as if that wasn't enough,

153
00:08:59.520 --> 00:09:04.440
hired him again for $7,000. Now that's $14,000.

154
00:09:04.441 --> 00:09:06.960
I've given my dad now. I haven't given it to him, but Netflix did now,

155
00:09:06.970 --> 00:09:11.160
whatever your welcome. The third special, Hey dad,

156
00:09:11.340 --> 00:09:15.510
here's another $7,000. You're welcome. Times three.

157
00:09:16.410 --> 00:09:18.480
And then your boy wanted to make a change.

158
00:09:18.660 --> 00:09:21.960
So what he did was I looked at my dad. I said, Hey, dad, you're fired.

159
00:09:21.961 --> 00:09:25.530
And then he said, what? And I said, Hey, Matt, you want to do my next special?

160
00:09:25.560 --> 00:09:27.240
And my dad said this the best firing ever,

161
00:09:27.390 --> 00:09:31.140
and my brother came through and took a Gatling gun. And just

162
00:09:34.770 --> 00:09:37.320
[inaudible]. It was great dude. The best dude. And it looks the.

163
00:09:38.370 --> 00:09:41.460
It looks so good. This is the best special I've ever done.

164
00:09:41.610 --> 00:09:44.970
And if you don't think so, what am I going to do, dude?

165
00:09:45.540 --> 00:09:48.720
What am I going to do? This is no pain.

166
00:09:53.090 --> 00:09:54.260
<v 2>What am I going to do?</v>

167
00:09:55.760 --> 00:09:57.710
<v 0>It's basically what I did on the follow, the leader tour.</v>

168
00:09:57.800 --> 00:09:58.581
I didn't want to call it.

169
00:09:58.581 --> 00:10:01.550
Follow the leader because your boy doesn't usually call specials the tornadoes,

170
00:10:02.000 --> 00:10:06.980
but it's called no pain, man. This is cool. The background is purple. What?

171
00:10:07.640 --> 00:10:09.350
The background? It's purple.

172
00:10:12.870 --> 00:10:17.510
First one was blue. Second one. First one was first. One was first one.

173
00:10:17.660 --> 00:10:20.750
It was an industrial vibe. Blue. Second one was rockstar blue.

174
00:10:20.990 --> 00:10:24.800
Third one was red. And then your boy goes purple.

175
00:10:26.270 --> 00:10:27.320
What is a Prince?

176
00:10:32.420 --> 00:10:33.253
Anyway, dude,

177
00:10:33.260 --> 00:10:37.820
I can't wait for this thing to come out and just for just that's it every

178
00:10:37.821 --> 00:10:40.310
special I do. I'm like, all right, maybe I'll maybe that's it now.

179
00:10:40.311 --> 00:10:42.620
What am I going to do? And I don't think I'll be able to do it again.

180
00:10:45.350 --> 00:10:48.260
Some of the I do is funny. Some of it's not, you know, whatever killed it,

181
00:10:50.720 --> 00:10:51.650
deal with it. That,

182
00:10:52.010 --> 00:10:55.220
that sunglasses mean where the sunglasses come down on your eyes and it goes

183
00:10:55.221 --> 00:10:56.450
deal with it. That's me, bro.

184
00:11:00.260 --> 00:11:01.010
<v 2>Okay.</v>

185
00:11:01.010 --> 00:11:05.810
<v 0>Look at this meme. The one with Morpheus. What if I told you deal with it?</v>

186
00:11:07.370 --> 00:11:12.170
Trying to put a square peg into a round hole. Um, anyway,

187
00:11:12.171 --> 00:11:14.480
dude, I can't wait for this thing to come out, put it in your queue,

188
00:11:14.520 --> 00:11:16.580
go right now, do it on your phone and put it on your list.

189
00:11:16.850 --> 00:11:19.670
You watch a the day it drops like a true baby. Anyway, dude,

190
00:11:19.700 --> 00:11:24.050
I'm being honestly annoying as right now, but this is it.

191
00:11:24.110 --> 00:11:28.610
This is what I did. And I'm sorry, but I'm not dude. Everybody's two people.

192
00:11:28.611 --> 00:11:31.610
That's why I love this. That's why I love Tupac, man. Everybody's two people.

193
00:11:31.611 --> 00:11:35.030
That's why I love Tupac because he would make a song called Brenda's got a baby

194
00:11:35.060 --> 00:11:37.820
and then he would make a song called wonder why they call you a?

195
00:11:38.600 --> 00:11:41.060
And people will be like, what the? How could you do that? That's hypocritical.

196
00:11:41.061 --> 00:11:44.810
And he would be like, everybody's two people. And I would be like, we may me.

197
00:11:45.080 --> 00:11:47.240
You know what I mean? Everyone is kind of two people, right?

198
00:11:47.810 --> 00:11:49.160
Cause sometimes you want to do in second,

199
00:11:49.161 --> 00:11:50.750
but also sometimes you want to raise children.

200
00:11:51.380 --> 00:11:52.850
Can't do both of those at the same time.

201
00:11:52.851 --> 00:11:54.670
I mean can with one person in the race children.

202
00:11:57.790 --> 00:11:58.623
<v 2>Anyway.</v>

203
00:12:02.640 --> 00:12:07.140
<v 0>Anyway, dude, we're having a good time, dude. We're having a really good time.</v>

204
00:12:08.580 --> 00:12:10.290
We're having a really good time. Cause I told you we are,

205
00:12:10.860 --> 00:12:13.020
I can't wait for it to come out. That's a whole commercial dude.

206
00:12:13.920 --> 00:12:17.640
Watch my special called no pain on a, on Netflix. Um,

207
00:12:19.620 --> 00:12:24.330
and it, it just sometimes all the stars align and you get a good taping.

208
00:12:24.720 --> 00:12:28.890
That's what it is. But sometimes they don't most of the time they don't. I mean,

209
00:12:28.891 --> 00:12:33.000
I did the comedians of the world. That audience was man. It was like,

210
00:12:33.001 --> 00:12:37.260
they were just eating breakfast. Yeah, bro.

211
00:12:38.370 --> 00:12:42.990
I want to do a special with no audience one of these days and just,

212
00:12:43.530 --> 00:12:47.100
just talk, man. That's kind of what, this is honestly this podcast, but

213
00:12:49.440 --> 00:12:51.300
anyway, look it up. Add it to your queue.
