00:00:01.830 --> 00:00:05.520
<v 0>D, I suppose I should talk about this Eminem thing. I forgot and logic thing.</v>

2
00:00:05.521 --> 00:00:07.170
I forgot to talk about this last week,

3
00:00:07.410 --> 00:00:12.390
the video came out and every time the video comes out or I

4
00:00:12.391 --> 00:00:15.600
get something big like that, I always text Brian Callan and will Sasso.

5
00:00:15.601 --> 00:00:19.860
It's different. Now I always send, I always say, Hey, it's different now.

6
00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:23.580
Or I'll go off state of Brian Callan. One time I was in an elevator,

7
00:00:23.670 --> 00:00:26.490
I told him I got some big news. It was them. And I'm thinking whatever I say,

8
00:00:26.500 --> 00:00:27.690
I'm going to be an M and M's video.

9
00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:31.980
And then I just looked at him and I go like this right into his face cycle by

10
00:00:32.370 --> 00:00:36.900
like, I'll never hang out with him again. I'm not even 40 though.

11
00:00:36.901 --> 00:00:40.950
I can get away with that. I'm so young. God it. I'm so young.

12
00:00:42.150 --> 00:00:46.470
There was no one younger. Um, so, so I.

13
00:00:46.470 --> 00:00:49.020
<v 1>Go by really obnoxious.</v>

14
00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:53.970
<v 0>To his face. So, but yeah. Um, was I talking about the Eminem thing? Yeah. So,</v>

15
00:00:54.510 --> 00:00:56.550
uh, so yeah, so here's how it went down.

16
00:00:56.790 --> 00:00:59.880
Cause I know people are asking because I see it.

17
00:01:00.450 --> 00:01:05.430
So I did the impression Eminem obviously tweeted about it and then

18
00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:09.150
logic and Eminem did a song logic put, uh,

19
00:01:09.480 --> 00:01:12.510
m&amp;m wanted to put me on the end of it. They called my manager, my manager said,

20
00:01:13.050 --> 00:01:17.430
oh, okay. And so then I let them have it.

21
00:01:17.730 --> 00:01:21.900
And then he's like, well, Monica wants to call you. Okay, isn't calling.

22
00:01:22.260 --> 00:01:24.390
And so logic called me, talked to logic.

23
00:01:24.391 --> 00:01:28.410
Logic's a nicest guy I ever met in my life over the phone. Uh, we talked, we,

24
00:01:30.120 --> 00:01:32.280
uh, and then he was like, I got an idea for the video.

25
00:01:32.281 --> 00:01:35.250
I think maybe it'd be cool video if like you did the m&amp;ms part. And I was like,

26
00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:41.190
you know, of course I'll do it. So then I

27
00:01:42.870 --> 00:01:46.590
showed up on the set and they showed me M and M's impression of me.

28
00:01:46.591 --> 00:01:48.210
They had already shot it in Detroit or some.

29
00:01:49.230 --> 00:01:54.000
And it was unbelievable to see M and M dressed in a wig of

30
00:01:54.030 --> 00:01:55.740
that would look like mine. And he was doing,

31
00:01:55.830 --> 00:01:59.640
of course when it was informal and a bonus and a phone.

32
00:02:00.870 --> 00:02:04.170
And I couldn't believe my eyes and they put my wig on.

33
00:02:04.171 --> 00:02:06.480
And then I wrapped M and M's part,

34
00:02:06.481 --> 00:02:09.960
it took about five hours and then I did it.

35
00:02:09.990 --> 00:02:13.380
And then it came out like three weeks later.

36
00:02:14.430 --> 00:02:15.420
And my life's different now.

37
00:02:19.760 --> 00:02:24.670
Um, what, what would DJ, uh, my price just went up.

38
00:02:24.740 --> 00:02:29.680
What would he say? What would that guy say? Uh, uh,

39
00:02:29.920 --> 00:02:31.480
not my price. What would he say?

40
00:02:32.650 --> 00:02:33.940
<v 1>I ma.</v>

41
00:02:35.390 --> 00:02:37.730
<v 0>My price just went up, I think, was that what he would say?</v>

42
00:02:39.380 --> 00:02:42.500
I don't know whatever he said though. You know, still in the meeting.

43
00:02:44.970 --> 00:02:48.270
<v 2>My price went up, my price just went up.</v>

44
00:02:50.670 --> 00:02:53.160
<v 0>Uh, it's the best DJ Kelly. Do, you know?</v>

45
00:02:53.880 --> 00:02:57.930
It's so funny that somebody could get so famous that everyone has to recognize

46
00:02:57.931 --> 00:02:58.621
them. No matter what,

47
00:02:58.621 --> 00:03:02.710
like I see like DJ Khalid in like videos with mark Walberg and I'm like, mark,

48
00:03:03.190 --> 00:03:03.460
Walberg.

49
00:03:03.460 --> 00:03:05.260
<v 3>What the are you doing? You.</v>

50
00:03:05.260 --> 00:03:05.980
<v 0>Know,</v>

51
00:03:05.980 --> 00:03:10.810
like you're a real actor and you're really good and cool and a

52
00:03:10.811 --> 00:03:13.840
family man and killing it. And you got Wahlburgers.

53
00:03:14.350 --> 00:03:16.630
<v 3>What the are you doing?</v>

54
00:03:17.500 --> 00:03:20.890
<v 0>Associating with a guy who's still in the meeting.</v>

55
00:03:22.480 --> 00:03:24.760
I'm still in the meeting. Somebody gets,

56
00:03:24.761 --> 00:03:27.940
that's the thing that's the goal is to get that famous to where you could just

57
00:03:27.941 --> 00:03:32.470
do, like be on a jet ski and be like, my price just went up.

58
00:03:33.220 --> 00:03:36.190
<v 1>And still half, half to have like.</v>

59
00:03:36.340 --> 00:03:40.510
<v 0>A legit, a list actor be like, all right, well, if I'm in a video with him,</v>

60
00:03:40.511 --> 00:03:43.090
I guess I'll get with the kids. I'll get the kids. They'll be,

61
00:03:43.630 --> 00:03:47.320
I'll be popping with the kids. I mean,

62
00:03:47.321 --> 00:03:51.760
DJ Khaled is basically, Tech-Talk still in the meeting.

63
00:03:53.680 --> 00:03:58.230
And then when DJ Kayla did the lat workouts, bro, I almost fainted. He did,

64
00:03:58.231 --> 00:04:03.130
he was doing it so bad. Um, but yeah,

65
00:04:03.750 --> 00:04:08.130
I don't know. I guess you got to, I guess if I was here we go,

66
00:04:08.160 --> 00:04:11.250
DJ Collins, hitting the weights. Look, this is the best. Oh,

67
00:04:11.251 --> 00:04:13.230
it's three minutes of it. Jesus Christ.

68
00:04:17.530 --> 00:04:21.850
He just, I, I want to meet DJ Kappa. He's a he's. He's probably a nice guy,

69
00:04:21.851 --> 00:04:25.990
right. He probably busted nuts so quick. It's unbelievable.

70
00:04:25.991 --> 00:04:30.610
Like he's never had a orgasm longer than half a second. Like he'll just be like,

71
00:04:30.611 --> 00:04:33.550
yeah, yeah, yeah. And then just, and that's it.

72
00:04:34.870 --> 00:04:39.250
And then he just rolls over because he's a quickest sleeper after an orgasm.

73
00:04:40.120 --> 00:04:41.350
<v 1>Oh yeah. Oh yeah.</v>

74
00:04:41.920 --> 00:04:44.980
<v 0>And that's it. And that's it like a lion, you know how they do it real quick</v>

75
00:04:47.590 --> 00:04:52.210
and it goes, my price just went up. I can't,

76
00:04:52.270 --> 00:04:54.070
I can't not make him sound like LL cool.

77
00:04:54.071 --> 00:04:58.030
J I don't remember what the DJ Khaled sounds like.

78
00:04:59.890 --> 00:05:02.260
Um, but yeah, just,

79
00:05:05.410 --> 00:05:09.280
uh, whatever, you know, what DJ,

80
00:05:10.180 --> 00:05:14.650
God, I, what is he worth? What's DJ caliber. This never right,

81
00:05:14.680 --> 00:05:16.840
but what's his net worth.

82
00:05:20.860 --> 00:05:23.890
Yeah. $35 million. I would think it'd be more than that.

83
00:05:23.891 --> 00:05:26.710
The guy produces everything. It probably is that always wrong.

84
00:05:27.310 --> 00:05:30.820
I think on mine it says mine's like $400 million and I'm like, okay,

85
00:05:30.821 --> 00:05:34.510
well when can I see that? So yeah, the Eminem thing was cool.

86
00:05:35.050 --> 00:05:37.390
I got to do that. It's actually awesome.

87
00:05:37.600 --> 00:05:40.750
I re I watched clips of the video for the first two days.

88
00:05:42.820 --> 00:05:44.500
And then I was like, wait, I never actually watched the video.

89
00:05:44.501 --> 00:05:49.150
And then I watched it on the second, uh, on like the third day.

90
00:05:49.510 --> 00:05:52.630
And I was like, Jesus Christ. It kind of gave me chills. I was like, dude,

91
00:05:52.631 --> 00:05:57.160
this is incredible. Actually like when I was nine,

92
00:05:57.410 --> 00:06:00.920
18 Eminem came out on the scene and I was like, whoa, this guy's amazing.

93
00:06:00.921 --> 00:06:02.390
And he was like one of my favorite rappers.

94
00:06:02.870 --> 00:06:06.770
And now I'm in a video and not only am I playing him, he's playing me.

95
00:06:08.180 --> 00:06:10.160
It was just really incredible.

96
00:06:10.760 --> 00:06:15.560
Those moments are few and far in between in your life. But, um,

97
00:06:16.700 --> 00:06:17.533
that was one of them.

98
00:06:17.840 --> 00:06:19.850
<v 3>And I'm very grateful for it. I really am.</v>

99
00:06:20.360 --> 00:06:22.040
<v 0>So that's what.</v>
