00:00:00.240 --> 00:00:03.510
<v 0>I remember my mom, dude, when I was a kid one time, Oh dude,</v>

2
00:00:03.511 --> 00:00:07.530
this is the best one time when I was a kid, um, my,

3
00:00:07.650 --> 00:00:11.610
my brother and I got in a fight and he was on the ground

4
00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:15.930
and I was joking with him.

5
00:00:16.480 --> 00:00:21.000
I took out my penis and I was like, I'm going to pee. I'm going to pee on you.

6
00:00:21.870 --> 00:00:25.470
If you're so little. I remember this though. I legitimately remember this.

7
00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:31.200
And my brother says, no, no, no, no. And I say, don't move. If you move,

8
00:00:31.201 --> 00:00:36.000
I'm going to pee on you. And my brother's like, no, no, no. And I remember like,

9
00:00:36.150 --> 00:00:39.510
you know, I was, I was too young to understand that this wasn't going to work,

10
00:00:39.511 --> 00:00:42.090
but you know how, like you can do like a Flint,

11
00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:44.490
you make someone flinch and you pretend like you're going to punch him,

12
00:00:44.491 --> 00:00:45.660
but you don't punch him.

13
00:00:46.070 --> 00:00:50.100
You just pull a punch back and they see you pull your punch back and they go

14
00:00:50.101 --> 00:00:53.820
like, wait, um, I don't. And then the joke is like, ha ha, almost got, gotcha.

15
00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:59.730
I did that with my PIs. And you can't. I was like,

16
00:00:59.731 --> 00:01:03.600
if I pretend I let my body PR like, let go.

17
00:01:04.980 --> 00:01:08.160
And I was like, I'm just going to pretend to pee. I did the flinch.

18
00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:11.460
You can't flinch. Your is going to come out.

19
00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:15.990
So I stopped my, I, I went to be a little bit and then stopped it.

20
00:01:16.230 --> 00:01:19.950
But I realized too late that you can't do that.

21
00:01:20.070 --> 00:01:21.300
Cause then is going to come out.

22
00:01:21.490 --> 00:01:23.850
But like I thought the pins were going to get sucked up, back into my penis

23
00:01:25.490 --> 00:01:29.900
and my brother goes no.

24
00:01:29.990 --> 00:01:33.920
And it legit just went right in his mouth.

25
00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:38.870
He went, no, and it goes, and he goes,

26
00:01:42.010 --> 00:01:44.810
and, and I go, Oh, and my,

27
00:01:45.080 --> 00:01:49.940
and my brother ran downstairs and he was like, ma and I,

28
00:01:50.030 --> 00:01:52.700
and I remember thinking, all right,

29
00:01:54.380 --> 00:01:56.180
if I just commit,

30
00:01:57.710 --> 00:02:02.450
she won't believe that I did that. And it'll be like,

31
00:02:02.480 --> 00:02:06.830
Matt's making it up. And I ran right after him. And Matt was like, mom,

32
00:02:07.070 --> 00:02:11.600
Chris in my mouth. And I said, no, I didn't. Why would I do that?

33
00:02:11.990 --> 00:02:16.730
And my mom was like, Matt, he was a key dad. And I was like, mom,

34
00:02:16.731 --> 00:02:20.570
why would I pee in someone's mouth? That was the first time I ever

35
00:02:22.880 --> 00:02:23.713
really lied.

36
00:02:26.130 --> 00:02:26.963
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

37
00:02:28.460 --> 00:02:28.881
<v 0>And, uh,</v>

38
00:02:28.881 --> 00:02:33.710
we've admitted it since obviously I've come clean to my mommy that it did in my,

39
00:02:33.770 --> 00:02:38.480
my brother's mouth. My mom would get so mad at us. Sometimes dude,

40
00:02:39.110 --> 00:02:42.770
she would always say this was her line dude, when we were around upstairs.

41
00:02:42.980 --> 00:02:46.760
And she was downstairs cooking Portuguese, which smelled like dogs.

42
00:02:46.820 --> 00:02:50.810
Anuses my mama cooked pierogies dude,

43
00:02:51.950 --> 00:02:56.360
dude, I would get dude. They would smell so bad. I guess she liked them,

44
00:02:56.361 --> 00:02:59.910
but I would be like, mom, please don't cook her. [inaudible] she be like,

45
00:03:00.490 --> 00:03:02.830
she's like, we're, I'm gonna, we're going to have pirogues tonight, but no,

46
00:03:02.831 --> 00:03:04.210
I'm not eating it. I'm not, you broke it.

47
00:03:04.211 --> 00:03:08.620
Never at Prague is glue because they smelled so bad. And she was like, well,

48
00:03:08.621 --> 00:03:10.120
they're a Polish dish. And ever since then,

49
00:03:10.121 --> 00:03:14.710
anytime someone says like Polish food, I'm like, Ugh. I was like,

50
00:03:14.740 --> 00:03:17.200
what the is the smell? I was like, mom, what's the smell. She's like,

51
00:03:17.201 --> 00:03:19.510
I think it's the butter. The way I cook it, dude, I would, I would be like,

52
00:03:19.511 --> 00:03:21.400
when you tell, when you cook pirogues, please tell me.

53
00:03:21.401 --> 00:03:23.740
So I could stay in my bedroom with the door closed.

54
00:03:23.890 --> 00:03:28.240
Cause it would stink up the whole house anyway.

55
00:03:29.590 --> 00:03:33.250
Uh, what a little brat kid too, just didn't want to eat. Well,

56
00:03:33.260 --> 00:03:37.900
my mom was making him in my younger brother's mouth. Cool Dick. Um,

57
00:03:38.530 --> 00:03:41.710
but my mom, anytime we were around, my mom would say,

58
00:03:43.900 --> 00:03:47.860
by the way, she never hit us once, but she would come. She would always say,

59
00:03:49.170 --> 00:03:50.610
I'm coming up swinging.

60
00:03:52.110 --> 00:03:56.670
She would be like stop right now or I'm coming up swinging

61
00:03:58.590 --> 00:04:00.210
laugh, dude. Cause we would think of my mom coming up,

62
00:04:00.240 --> 00:04:01.920
just like flailing her arms and.

63
00:04:02.880 --> 00:04:05.940
My brother always thought of imagined her with the wooden spoon. Just like,

64
00:04:07.140 --> 00:04:12.030
like just blindly swinging and we'd have to move out of the way dude.

65
00:04:12.031 --> 00:04:14.970
We would laugh. We would be fighting each other. And then my mom will be like,

66
00:04:14.971 --> 00:04:16.110
I'm coming up swinging.

67
00:04:16.320 --> 00:04:19.440
And then we would start laughing and then bond over it and then become best

68
00:04:19.441 --> 00:04:22.140
friends. So thanks mom for that.

69
00:04:24.300 --> 00:04:26.400
Thanks for threatening us about coming up, swinging.
