00:00:00.180 --> 00:00:02.310
<v 0>Did you see the Oscars man?</v>

2
00:00:02.340 --> 00:00:05.820
I watched parasite and I loved that movie,

3
00:00:06.090 --> 00:00:10.830
but I thought the main good thing about that movie was the, uh, the screenplay.

4
00:00:12.390 --> 00:00:15.570
Um, and I thought it was directed great. And all the acting was really great.

5
00:00:15.650 --> 00:00:17.970
And I liked the movie. Um,

6
00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:22.320
and then this guy tweeted this thing about,

7
00:00:22.640 --> 00:00:24.000
it's such a bad tweet.

8
00:00:26.190 --> 00:00:27.990
John Miller is at Miller stream,

9
00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:33.270
a man named bong Joon ho wins Oscar for best original screenplay over once upon

10
00:00:33.271 --> 00:00:37.710
a time in Hollywood in 1917, acceptance speech was great honor. Thank you.

11
00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:39.930
Then he proceeds to give the rest of his speech in the Korean.

12
00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:42.030
These people are the destruction of America.

13
00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:48.000
That's so bad to say,

14
00:00:48.990 --> 00:00:53.880
you know, like just straight up, what are you saying? Hey dude,

15
00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:55.770
trying to date you're on graph.

16
00:00:58.260 --> 00:00:58.470
<v 1>See.</v>

17
00:00:58.470 --> 00:00:59.910
<v 0>It's interesting that like,</v>

18
00:01:01.560 --> 00:01:06.390
Trump has really brought these out, you know, bring them out,

19
00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:10.740
bring them out. That's what they'd be yelling when the barrels in the mouth,

20
00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:13.440
when you know that song, that Z song and never knew what he was saying.

21
00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:17.100
Barela was like Burrell. He's saying barrel. I wish he just said that's what?

22
00:01:17.101 --> 00:01:20.730
Just say saying when the bevel is in your mouth, why doesn't he do that? Why?

23
00:01:20.790 --> 00:01:24.720
I don't know. Why does he say I, I need to like Hindus no way.

24
00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:28.320
Why does he say that in a song? Don't know, but he does.

25
00:01:29.910 --> 00:01:33.360
Yeah. Since secure,

26
00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:36.180
always how he laughs it's all. Okay.

27
00:01:41.300 --> 00:01:45.680
I ain't need to like, Intuit's no way anyway.

28
00:01:47.690 --> 00:01:51.680
Um, so without the Jews,

29
00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:53.690
that's why the Jews bought out a property

30
00:01:55.310 --> 00:01:56.900
should have bought a property in Dumbo,

31
00:01:57.350 --> 00:02:01.040
but I didn't because the Jews bought it and now I'm kicking myself

32
00:02:03.020 --> 00:02:07.160
Hayne until I can do. It's no way. Um,

33
00:02:08.360 --> 00:02:11.750
so yeah. And then I wrote

34
00:02:14.060 --> 00:02:18.320
J Jesus. I wrote, well,

35
00:02:18.321 --> 00:02:21.980
there's a ridiculous tweet. Jesus Christ. Um,

36
00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:25.610
it's weird to think like extremely left.

37
00:02:25.611 --> 00:02:27.860
And then also it's weird to think extremely, right? Like,

38
00:02:28.070 --> 00:02:30.890
and then you see people like what's that girl's name?

39
00:02:31.370 --> 00:02:33.560
Brin who's the girl who played captain Marvel.

40
00:02:34.010 --> 00:02:37.820
And she's just like a guy looked at me now and you're like, okay,

41
00:02:38.600 --> 00:02:42.470
let's just meet in the middle. I, you know,

42
00:02:43.460 --> 00:02:47.090
or, or, or walking Phoenix acceptance speech where he's just like,

43
00:02:47.150 --> 00:02:49.850
thanks for the Oscar. Don't drink milk Casey. Yeah.

44
00:02:52.670 --> 00:02:57.410
Takes thanks for the Oscar. Thanks for the Oscar. Stop. Squeezing cows. Casey,

45
00:02:57.710 --> 00:03:02.320
ya pivot peel. Whether we're talking,

46
00:03:02.350 --> 00:03:03.670
there's a part where he was like,

47
00:03:03.760 --> 00:03:07.590
whether we're talking about black people or cows, like, and how,

48
00:03:07.591 --> 00:03:11.290
how do we not miss that too? Like,

49
00:03:11.350 --> 00:03:14.530
it's all because we love occupants who is a super talented guy.

50
00:03:14.560 --> 00:03:16.510
And obviously his heart is in the right place.

51
00:03:16.720 --> 00:03:21.610
And obviously he's such a great guy just cares about lots of.

52
00:03:22.150 --> 00:03:25.870
But like if I went up there, like if I've, if I,

53
00:03:25.871 --> 00:03:30.670
for some reason went up and was just

54
00:03:30.671 --> 00:03:34.720
like, guys, thanks so much for the Oscar. This is amazing.

55
00:03:35.080 --> 00:03:39.670
But also black people and cows need rights. You'd be like,

56
00:03:40.090 --> 00:03:41.830
Kay, we shouldn't have gave him the Oscar,

57
00:03:44.020 --> 00:03:48.130
whether we're talking about Koreans or animals. Like,

58
00:03:48.940 --> 00:03:53.020
how did we miss that? It's because dude, you give people,

59
00:03:54.280 --> 00:03:59.080
they make a, they make a, they like, if the rock said it,

60
00:03:59.081 --> 00:04:03.340
it will be okay. If a comedian said, they'd be done, dude,

61
00:04:03.880 --> 00:04:08.260
if Rogan or anybody went up there and just were like said what? He said,

62
00:04:08.261 --> 00:04:11.020
they'd be like, why is he comparing black people like cows?

63
00:04:13.410 --> 00:04:14.243
<v 2>Cool.</v>

64
00:04:15.030 --> 00:04:17.940
<v 0>Um, these acceptance speeches are just,</v>

65
00:04:18.030 --> 00:04:20.520
I love walking Phoenix and I'm not even talking about his,

66
00:04:20.760 --> 00:04:24.420
but these acceptance speeches are just so awful.

67
00:04:24.990 --> 00:04:25.860
You know,

68
00:04:26.400 --> 00:04:31.260
once they get to that point you're Oh great. Oh great.

69
00:04:31.740 --> 00:04:35.850
No, but I'd like to thank this person, that person I'd like to take that.

70
00:04:36.180 --> 00:04:40.950
And you know, once they get to that point, you're like, Oh, here it comes.

00:04:41.280 --> 00:04:45.720
The distraction of the N Oh boy. And the thing is in the rights.

Winning and then saying, great honor. Thank you.

89
00:06:02.531 --> 00:06:04.120
And then these people destruction of America,

90
00:06:04.121 --> 00:06:05.920
he went on to tweet John Miller went on to tweet.

91
00:06:06.100 --> 00:06:08.440
These people are obviously not Koreans, but those in Hollywood of warning of,

92
00:06:08.441 --> 00:06:12.700
for a foreign film, that Stokes flames of class warfare over two films,

93
00:06:13.570 --> 00:06:16.240
I thought were more deservingly, simply reserving,

94
00:06:16.241 --> 00:06:18.070
simply to show how woke they are.

95
00:06:20.590 --> 00:06:21.423
<v 1>Oh.</v>

96
00:06:21.490 --> 00:06:23.500
<v 0>That should be clear from the rest of what I tweeted about tonight's production,</v>

97
00:06:23.501 --> 00:06:24.310
you know?

98
00:06:24.310 --> 00:06:25.143
<v 1>Okay.</v>

99
00:06:27.910 --> 00:06:30.880
<v 0>Okay, man, you don't vote for.</v>

100
00:06:32.170 --> 00:06:33.850
<v 1>That. Okay.</v>

101
00:06:34.150 --> 00:06:37.450
<v 0>You're the host of something on blaze TV.</v>

102
00:06:38.750 --> 00:06:39.583
<v 1>Yeah. No.</v>

103
00:06:42.370 --> 00:06:45.550
<v 0>I think, um, I don't know who this guy is, whatever fine. I'm sure.</v>

104
00:06:45.580 --> 00:06:49.450
Maybe his heart's in the right place. I have no idea, but sounds bad.

105
00:06:49.720 --> 00:06:52.210
Tweet sounds bad. Um, also,

106
00:06:52.270 --> 00:06:56.500
if you're going to argue anything about any screenplay,

107
00:06:56.710 --> 00:07:00.010
that was that to me and I, I didn't see all the movies,

108
00:07:00.040 --> 00:07:03.160
but that was that movies. Screenplay was so good.

109
00:07:03.280 --> 00:07:07.240
If you have a gripe with that movie and it's the screenplay,

110
00:07:07.360 --> 00:07:08.740
I don't know where your head is, man.

111
00:07:11.350 --> 00:07:15.250
It's also not like to say that he won because Hollywood is woke.

112
00:07:15.280 --> 00:07:18.310
I guess maybe why? Cause he's Korean, I guess. I don't know. Weird,

113
00:07:19.000 --> 00:07:22.270
weird that he's saying that weird, these picking that battle. I think,

114
00:07:22.390 --> 00:07:27.040
cause that movie was awesome. And how cute was the guy who won it? When he won,

115
00:07:27.490 --> 00:07:30.130
he was just like, Oh, Oh, Oh, Oh.

116
00:07:30.910 --> 00:07:34.900
And then he was like talking about all the other guys who are winning,

117
00:07:34.920 --> 00:07:38.470
who he was like Martin Scorsese. You know,

118
00:07:39.370 --> 00:07:41.650
I can't believe I'm standing here with you or whatever the you said.

119
00:07:41.651 --> 00:07:44.350
I don't know. It doesn't matter. But it was cute as, man.

120
00:07:47.200 --> 00:07:48.430
<v 1>God, that guy looks so polite.</v>

121
00:07:50.380 --> 00:07:52.000
<v 0>Bong, Joon ho looks so polite.</v>

122
00:07:52.030 --> 00:07:56.200
He looks like he's never eaten something and gone. Yeah.

123
00:07:56.260 --> 00:07:59.920
Even if it was gross, he's so polite.

124
00:08:00.280 --> 00:08:02.950
Like he for sure eats at people's houses. And he was like,

125
00:08:02.951 --> 00:08:06.490
what a wonderful meal the whole time. No matter what it is, they'd be like,

126
00:08:06.491 --> 00:08:09.460
this is a car. This is, this is the cardboard,

127
00:08:10.930 --> 00:08:13.430
this is, this is cardboard. And he's like, Oh, I'm gonna order it from you.

128
00:08:14.020 --> 00:08:18.100
That's how he looks. Have you guys seen the host? It's so good.

129
00:08:18.490 --> 00:08:22.930
And uh, Snowpiercer is so good. That movie should have been

130
00:08:24.700 --> 00:08:27.160
you guys gotta see Snowpiercer it's so good with Chris Evans.

131
00:08:29.020 --> 00:08:33.580
<v 1>Um, but I got it.</v>

132
00:08:34.630 --> 00:08:37.660
<v 0>I wish I could see that movie again. I never watched movies twice. that dude.</v>

133
00:08:38.830 --> 00:08:40.420
One time in high school, my buddy wanted to see,

134
00:08:40.450 --> 00:08:43.030
he saw Braveheart and every time people come over and watch Braveheart and I was

135
00:08:43.031 --> 00:08:44.830
like, dude, you watch them. We watch it one time.

136
00:08:44.831 --> 00:08:46.390
And how you go through that again.

137
00:08:47.080 --> 00:08:51.310
Braveheart of all movies to watch over and over again. It's wrong with you?

138
00:08:52.030 --> 00:08:55.090
I guess his Dick cut off at the end. Ruined it. Spoiler alert.

139
00:08:58.130 --> 00:09:00.980
Or maybe they cut his Tommy open. You never really know actually

140
00:09:03.200 --> 00:09:05.450
Timothy Charlemagne. I liked Timothy Charlemagne man.

141
00:09:06.770 --> 00:09:10.820
Definitely call it chill. I'm it? Timothy [inaudible].

142
00:09:11.540 --> 00:09:15.290

00:09:23.120 --> 00:09:24.980
He just put on him. He wore a track suit, dude.

146
00:09:24.981 --> 00:09:29.090
That's the that he's I liked that he's doing that man. Cause it's so annoying.

147
00:09:29.091 --> 00:09:31.490
Everyone gets all dressed up and everyone's so annoying.

148
00:09:31.790 --> 00:09:35.960
I brought some of these dresses. They got to stand out.

149
00:09:36.890 --> 00:09:40.310
Who was the girl that wore the hood. She looked like a star Wars, character,

150
00:09:41.870 --> 00:09:45.080
Janell Monae. Is that her name? And it's like,

151
00:09:45.081 --> 00:09:49.010
every time it showed the audience, my eye went right to her. It's like.

152
00:09:49.550 --> 00:09:52.850
<v 1>Oh, how about spite</v>

153
00:09:54.620 --> 00:09:55.453
LA? Yeah.

155
00:10:01.221 --> 00:10:05.060

158
00:10:15.680 --> 00:10:19.400
Whatever you presented, the guy came up and it was like so beautiful.

159
00:10:19.401 --> 00:10:23.180
I think it was bond June or whatever the guy's name is. He won. And then,

160
00:10:23.181 --> 00:10:24.680
and then he walked off.

161
00:10:25.550 --> 00:10:27.230
<v 1>The moment, uh,</v>

162
00:10:30.110 --> 00:10:34.730

He's very eloquent.

193
00:12:42.090 --> 00:12:47.070
He's got his hairpiece on and it's looking natch and he's got his cool talks on.

196
00:12:55.620 --> 00:12:57.960
<v 0>This is when he really knows he's starting to kill it too right here.</v>

197
00:12:58.050 --> 00:12:59.010
When he says wickedly.

198
00:12:59.430 --> 00:13:03.930
<v 3>Movie frozen, please welcome the wickedly talented one.</v>

199
00:13:03.931 --> 00:13:05.670
And only, uh.

200
00:13:06.120 --> 00:13:09.990
<v 0>The wickedly talented one and only this is what I think went on in his head</v>

201
00:13:09.991 --> 00:13:14.130
right now. He's forgetting how to pronounce her name. He knows it and he thinks,

202
00:13:14.160 --> 00:13:14.993
you know what,

203
00:13:15.090 --> 00:13:19.740

205
00:13:24.001 --> 00:13:27.300
Right. Because I've said it before and then it doesn't.

206
00:13:28.110 --> 00:13:31.230
And that to me honestly.

207
00:13:32.850 --> 00:13:35.850
<v 3>Does the [inaudible].</v>

208
00:13:37.170 --> 00:13:42.120
<v 0>That moment look at the frame when he's looking to his left, he's just like,</v>

209
00:13:42.121 --> 00:13:43.080
okay, well I it up.

210
00:13:43.290 --> 00:13:48.270
And that moment was the moment where you know how you've

211
00:13:48.271 --> 00:13:52.860
seen John Travolta bald a lot lately. He was just like, ah, it. I, you know, um,

212
00:13:53.310 --> 00:13:56.460
that moment I guarantee that moment was what made him realize I don't need to

213
00:13:56.670 --> 00:14:01.260
wear a hairpiece, uh, this. You know, I mean, bro,

214
00:14:01.470 --> 00:14:03.300

<v 3>The smile special place in my heart, ready, movie musical, killing it.</v>

216
00:14:07.140 --> 00:14:11.520
And for the songs that create their most memorable moments here to perform the

217
00:14:11.521 --> 00:14:15.270
Oscar nominated gorgeously empowering song, let it go.

218
00:14:15.630 --> 00:14:18.240
<v 0>He realizes he can't remember her name. When he says gorgeous.</v>

219
00:14:18.900 --> 00:14:22.020
<v 3>Let it go from the Oscar winning animated movie,</v>

220
00:14:22.050 --> 00:14:24.870

<v 0>It was Gordy gorgeously. Cause he had something else on his mind.</v>

224
00:14:34.831 --> 00:14:37.980
It was like a little too long to say gorgeous. And then, and then he was like,

225
00:14:38.580 --> 00:14:42.210
it. I don't know what it is this whole time. And then when he unused my coffee,

226
00:14:43.080 --> 00:14:46.560
that's the confidence kicking in and then it didn't have it though.

227
00:14:48.670 --> 00:14:53.540
[inaudible] literally just say Frank Drebin you know what I mean? it.

228
00:14:53.840 --> 00:14:56.600
It would been way better. Why do you say Frank? Drebin he'd be like, Oh,

229
00:14:56.601 --> 00:14:58.250
I was thinking about, uh,

00:14:58.280 --> 00:15:02.870
naked gun Lieutenant Drebin please welcome Lieutenant Drebin.

231
00:15:04.400 --> 00:15:05.360
That would have been amazing.

232
00:15:05.510 --> 00:15:08.750
And then everyone would have clapped still and you would be like you still

235
00:15:18.111 --> 00:15:19.490

<v 2>Let it go. Let it go.</v>

237
00:15:26.800 --> 00:15:30.610

238
00:15:32.080 --> 00:15:36.340
Oh, his kids were like, Oh no. Um,

239
00:15:37.930 --> 00:15:39.880
but the other one was good. The other,

240
00:15:40.240 --> 00:15:43.770
another one was good at the end with James Cameron. When he, when he,

241
00:15:43.990 --> 00:15:48.550
when he wins for Titanic with the tales, you know,

242
00:15:49.000 --> 00:15:52.870

Linda nice are two beautiful children and Joseph's well,

244
00:15:56.771 --> 00:16:00.820

245
00:16:02.410 --> 00:16:06.640
originally. My parents who are here tonight, Phillip,

246
00:16:06.700 --> 00:16:10.510
Phillip and Shirley Cameron, mom, dad.

247
00:16:10.540 --> 00:16:15.400
There's no way I can express to you what I'm feeling right

248
00:16:15.401 --> 00:16:20.380
now. My heart is full to bursting except to say that.

249
00:16:25.540 --> 00:16:25.810
<v 2>[Inaudible].</v>

250
00:16:25.810 --> 00:16:29.830
<v 0>My whole thing don't will never will. My whole thing is never Whoa.</v>

251
00:16:30.250 --> 00:16:34.990
And he goes, I'm the King of the wild and that's one of those God,

252
00:16:35.140 --> 00:16:37.660
it's amazing. These guys who's I mean, one of the, I mean,

253
00:16:37.661 --> 00:16:42.220
so talented makes creates these worlds and then they just get up on stage and

254
00:16:42.221 --> 00:16:45.400
you can see they're not used to it and they're a little bit nervous.

255
00:16:45.790 --> 00:16:49.390
And then just, it's funny too,

256
00:16:49.391 --> 00:16:54.190
being a standup comedian helps so much just in life, man. It just helps so much.

257
00:16:54.520 --> 00:16:57.640
You don't give a about stuff. Like you could tell. He was like, Oh,

258
00:16:57.641 --> 00:17:01.810
this seems like a better idea in my head when I cause it's a line in the movie.

259
00:17:01.811 --> 00:17:05.200
And then when he said it he's like gone, maybe it's insecure, but it's like,

260
00:17:05.201 --> 00:17:07.420
if you were a comedian and you did it and you were out there and you went,

261
00:17:07.421 --> 00:17:08.860
I'm the King of the world. You're like, Oh this is a bad idea.

262
00:17:08.861 --> 00:17:12.160
You'd literally be like, Oh, well, whatever I that up. And then it will be fine,

263
00:17:12.161 --> 00:17:15.970
you know? But instead.

264
00:17:21.070 --> 00:17:21.903
<v 2>[Inaudible].</v>

265
00:17:22.000 --> 00:17:26.740
<v 0>A disease. He just says the wickedly talented, the wooden only disease,</v>

266
00:17:27.820 --> 00:17:32.140
Aziz Ansari. Wow dude,

267
00:17:32.740 --> 00:17:34.870
the Oscars are hilarious, dude.

268
00:17:36.190 --> 00:17:39.760
When Brando brought up the, remember this I don't,

269
00:17:39.880 --> 00:17:42.820
but it's a thing right here. When he went for a run.

270
00:17:46.270 --> 00:17:47.103
<v 2>Obviously.</v>

271
00:17:55.050 --> 00:17:59.940
<v 0>You brought up an Indian woman, native American, whatever. I don't know how.</v>

272
00:18:04.490 --> 00:18:08.780
<v 4>Hello. My name is Sasha middle feather. I'm a patchy.</v>

273
00:18:08.930 --> 00:18:13.640
And I'm president of the national native American affirmative image committee

274
00:18:14.540 --> 00:18:19.310
representing Marlon Brando this evening to tell you in a

275
00:18:19.311 --> 00:18:20.540
very long speech,

276
00:18:20.600 --> 00:18:24.680
which I cannot share with you presently because of time.

277
00:18:25.160 --> 00:18:29.330
But I will be glad to share with the press afterwards that he re very

278
00:18:29.331 --> 00:18:30.230
regretfully,

279
00:18:30.620 --> 00:18:35.600
cannot accept this very generous award and the

280
00:18:35.601 --> 00:18:37.930
reasons for this being odd,

281
00:18:37.931 --> 00:18:42.650
the treatment of American Indians today by the film industry,

282
00:18:44.000 --> 00:18:45.290
excuse me. Wow.

283
00:18:46.820 --> 00:18:50.750
<v 0>Wow. Wow. People BU</v>

284
00:18:52.580 --> 00:18:54.950
trying to make a point here. People BU that dresses.

285
00:18:55.590 --> 00:18:56.810
<v 4>Movie reruns,</v>

286
00:18:58.070 --> 00:19:01.160
and also with recent happenings at wounded knee,

287
00:19:02.030 --> 00:19:06.350
I begged at this time that I have not intruded upon the seasoning

288
00:19:07.070 --> 00:19:09.710
and that we will in the future,

289
00:19:10.310 --> 00:19:14.720
our hearts and our understandings will meet with love and

290
00:19:14.721 --> 00:19:18.260
generosity. Thank you. On behalf of mom and Brando.

291
00:19:22.220 --> 00:19:26.560
<v 0>Dude, he didn't even show up and he was like, yo doing,</v>

292
00:19:28.310 --> 00:19:31.010
you'll go talk about wounded name.

293
00:19:31.970 --> 00:19:36.410
If I get a Oscar dude, there's no way I'm going up to accept it.

294
00:19:36.770 --> 00:19:41.480
I'm sending for real David Caruso and he's going to go

295
00:19:41.570 --> 00:19:44.810
up and he's going to he's, you know, he's going to say, he's going to say,

296
00:19:45.320 --> 00:19:46.940
sorry, but Chris D'Elia,

297
00:19:46.970 --> 00:19:51.710
can't be here and he's going to say he wanted to,

298
00:19:52.460 --> 00:19:56.540
but the buddy went to the doctor the other day and it turns out

299
00:19:57.740 --> 00:19:59.450
he's just too sick with it.

300
00:19:59.750 --> 00:20:04.130
And then he puts his glasses on and pivots and then that happens.

301
00:20:06.470 --> 00:20:07.790
And then they say coming up

302
00:20:11.630 --> 00:20:16.460
[inaudible] award for best cinematographer, dude. That will be the dude.

303
00:20:17.120 --> 00:20:19.640
He went to the doctor the other day and it wasn't go home.

304
00:20:19.730 --> 00:20:22.220
So I was on the wall and it turns out

305
00:20:23.780 --> 00:20:25.490
he's too sick with it.

306
00:20:31.010 --> 00:20:31.490
Yeah, dude.
