1
00:00:00.450 --> 00:00:05.420
<v 0>Yes. Woo. I finished breaking bad. Woo. White, my,</v>

2
00:00:05.900 --> 00:00:10.010
my arms white as, but it's also lumpy. You know what that means, man,

3
00:00:10.580 --> 00:00:14.960
your boy chin-ups. Yeah. It's why he doesn't go outside because he's inside.

4
00:00:15.020 --> 00:00:19.130
Don't chin ups. I'm a prisoner inside, dude.

5
00:00:19.131 --> 00:00:21.710
Just have you seen prisoners workout, bro? First of all,

6
00:00:21.800 --> 00:00:23.660
this talk about breaking bad in, then we'll talk about prisoners working out.

7
00:00:23.661 --> 00:00:26.060
I saw some prison workouts on YouTube and it's unbelievable, dude.

8
00:00:26.210 --> 00:00:29.210
Those are the most fit. Jack dudes on the planet.

9
00:00:29.360 --> 00:00:31.820
How come black dudes in the prison are so jacked.

10
00:00:31.850 --> 00:00:36.620
White dudes in prison are either so frail or fat as and all.

11
00:00:36.621 --> 00:00:40.850
I mean it's unbelievable, dude, white guys in prison.

12
00:00:41.300 --> 00:00:42.920
If they're jacked, they're also fat.

13
00:00:42.950 --> 00:00:47.390
They have a belly black dudes they're so top heavy. They're always running.

14
00:00:47.570 --> 00:00:49.010
Cause I can't help it because they're falling over, dude.

15
00:00:49.010 --> 00:00:51.590
I can't believe black dudes in prison. They're so jacked. It's unbelievable.

16
00:00:52.280 --> 00:00:57.230
But let's talk about breaking bad. I finally watched it and this is very timely.

17
00:00:57.231 --> 00:00:58.790
My babies, this is very timely.

18
00:00:58.791 --> 00:01:03.050
I know the show ended in 2013, seven years ago,

19
00:01:03.051 --> 00:01:04.310
but your boy just watched it.

20
00:01:04.311 --> 00:01:07.670
I was waiting for a time to watch it because I don't watch shows like that.

21
00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:11.090
I don't just continually watch. I don't watch all seasons of anything.

22
00:01:11.091 --> 00:01:14.900
The only thing I've ever seen every episode of is actually missed one episode of

23
00:01:14.901 --> 00:01:17.600
Dexter. But besides that I seen the whole on Dexter.

24
00:01:17.750 --> 00:01:18.680
And let me tell you something, man.

25
00:01:18.681 --> 00:01:20.540
I was talking about this on the Brogan podcast. I did this,

26
00:01:20.720 --> 00:01:22.880
I did this last week. We were talking to Rogan about it,

27
00:01:22.881 --> 00:01:26.120
but I think shows can only be good for about five seasons,

28
00:01:26.150 --> 00:01:27.530
maybe six seasons dude.

29
00:01:28.580 --> 00:01:32.210
But the second you do your walking dead it the second year. Just like,

30
00:01:32.211 --> 00:01:33.890
well let's just keep going and keep making money.

31
00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:37.190
And Rogan brought up a popular, uh, um, a very good point.

32
00:01:37.460 --> 00:01:41.030
You don't want to end the show because all these people working on it,

33
00:01:42.470 --> 00:01:43.640
that's their livelihood.

34
00:01:43.641 --> 00:01:45.920
And you don't want to end the show creatively just because these other,

35
00:01:47.690 --> 00:01:49.970
that's what they get their job. That's where they get their paycheck from.

36
00:01:49.971 --> 00:01:52.250
So you've got a guy who's holding the mic. He's just like, Oh,

37
00:01:52.251 --> 00:01:55.580
this is the last season. Okay, cool. Guess I'll sell my place.

38
00:01:55.880 --> 00:01:58.880
Like you don't want the guy holding the thing or the ladies holding the bagel,

39
00:01:58.881 --> 00:02:02.600
putting out the spread for craft service. Oh this is the last season. Well,

40
00:02:02.601 --> 00:02:06.920
okay. I'll move to van Nuys or this is the last season. Okay.

41
00:02:08.150 --> 00:02:10.190
Well I'll just move to the outskirts of Atlanta.

42
00:02:12.440 --> 00:02:15.320
You don't want to do that, dude. Let me tell you right now, man.

43
00:02:15.650 --> 00:02:20.570
Let me tell you right. Now, if I ever get a show on the air, my show,

44
00:02:20.571 --> 00:02:23.930
I'm talking about my. Now we're on the lead where it's my where I produce it.

45
00:02:24.080 --> 00:02:29.060
Okay. Um, I'm doing two things.

46
00:02:29.061 --> 00:02:29.930
I'm doing one of two things.

47
00:02:29.931 --> 00:02:32.930
I'm either stopping it four seasons in and getting the out.

48
00:02:33.590 --> 00:02:36.590
I just making some that hits the desert Geist hopefully.

49
00:02:37.010 --> 00:02:41.330
Or I'm running that into the ground. I'm doing,

50
00:02:42.170 --> 00:02:46.160
I'm talking. I'm I'm talking about, if it's a hit, I'm doing 12 seasons.

51
00:02:46.161 --> 00:02:49.370
And they're like, well, what do you think? I said, we got more seasons. Really?

52
00:02:49.400 --> 00:02:51.560
The lead character isn't even in it anymore. By the way,

53
00:02:51.620 --> 00:02:55.970
nobody in the original show is in the new sh is in the show.

54
00:02:55.971 --> 00:03:00.070
If it goes 12 seasons, they've all died. Either of characters,

55
00:03:00.071 --> 00:03:03.760
killing them or natural causes in real life. And we don't even explain it.

56
00:03:03.761 --> 00:03:05.740
They're just dead. And we're like, Oh, a new guy's playing them now.

57
00:03:05.860 --> 00:03:07.690
And then that guy dies. Cause we have to kill off the character.

58
00:03:08.110 --> 00:03:11.860
And then there's just a new cast and the show becomes about something else.

59
00:03:12.160 --> 00:03:16.390
Like dude, if I was making the walking dead, how's this for a YouTube clip,

60
00:03:16.391 --> 00:03:18.340
dude. If I was making the walking dead,

61
00:03:18.370 --> 00:03:22.840
that lasts about six seasons and then the cures.

62
00:03:22.990 --> 00:03:25.750
I don't give a what happened in the graphic novels. It doesn't matter. I get it.

63
00:03:25.751 --> 00:03:29.410
Graphic novels. Okay. Everyone's going to be like, Oh yeah, but what about this?

64
00:03:29.440 --> 00:03:31.900
No matter what is not true to the, I don't give a.

65
00:03:32.320 --> 00:03:34.240
It's not true to it because this is a different medium.

66
00:03:34.930 --> 00:03:37.480
Your boy is different on his podcast that he is in you,

67
00:03:38.320 --> 00:03:42.760
that he is on stage at stand up. You want the raw real deal. You get it here.

68
00:03:45.870 --> 00:03:46.703
You know what I mean?

69
00:03:47.790 --> 00:03:50.100
You want a hot flames performance to get it there on stage.

70
00:03:50.190 --> 00:03:54.630
If you want me tied up acting my chops off, dude,

71
00:03:56.010 --> 00:03:59.610
then you turn on you. If I take a graphic novel,

72
00:03:59.611 --> 00:04:02.370
like walking dead and I do it for six seasons,

73
00:04:02.371 --> 00:04:03.600
then it becomes the biggest show on television.

74
00:04:03.601 --> 00:04:05.070
Like it did guess what the virus does.

75
00:04:05.310 --> 00:04:08.760
Seventh season is cured and then everyone starts to get new jobs and then it

76
00:04:08.761 --> 00:04:13.410
becomes a office comedy. And if you think of dude, if somebody did that,

77
00:04:13.411 --> 00:04:16.530
dude, that would be unbelievable. They all got real jobs.

78
00:04:16.531 --> 00:04:19.320
And now all of a sudden they're like working construction and it becomes a

79
00:04:19.650 --> 00:04:22.470
movie. It becomes a TV show about like, uh, the,

80
00:04:22.471 --> 00:04:25.440
whoever the lead character is at that point has a construction job.

81
00:04:25.470 --> 00:04:28.530
And he's trying to keep his family afloat in the times of, of like,

82
00:04:31.130 --> 00:04:32.820
it's just a completely different show.

83
00:04:32.821 --> 00:04:36.090
And half the idiots out there don't even know what the they're watching anymore.

84
00:04:36.091 --> 00:04:39.930
They're just like, Oh wait, the walking dead is all.

85
00:04:39.960 --> 00:04:42.240
And I'm going to change the title to by the, by the 11th season,

86
00:04:42.241 --> 00:04:46.500
I'm changing the title. It's called construction.

87
00:04:48.600 --> 00:04:52.470
That is what shows need to do. Stop drilling it into the ground.

88
00:04:53.280 --> 00:04:56.790
Oh really? Walkers. Oh, they're walking around.

89
00:04:57.240 --> 00:05:00.990
Let me get someone gets bitten. Let me guess on an all new walking,

90
00:05:00.991 --> 00:05:05.760
dead someone we love gets bit N that.

91
00:05:05.970 --> 00:05:10.620
Cure the virus and put them all in Kinko's dude.

92
00:05:12.900 --> 00:05:17.310
No more frigging zombies. Just

93
00:05:20.100 --> 00:05:20.100
[inaudible]. Hey, got those copies. Cool. You know what

94
00:05:20.100 --> 00:05:20.100

stewardesses are coming by with drinks. So take your order.

101
00:06:06.790 --> 00:06:11.350
This is a cashless system. When you did your cohort with the chip.

00:07:32.200 --> 00:07:36.100
That's it, dude. If AMC was like, dude, we make money.

121
00:07:36.280 --> 00:07:39.340
We're going to make you more money and you do more seasons. Then I go like this.

122
00:07:39.550 --> 00:07:42.250
Well then guess what? Man, new characters,

<v 1>Yeah.</v>

126
00:07:56.020 --> 00:07:59.110
<v 0>So yeah. I don't know. I mean, it's one thing. If it's a comfort show,</v>

127
00:07:59.111 --> 00:08:03.190
like if it's like what do you call it with the geeks on the, on ABC,

128
00:08:03.220 --> 00:08:05.110
the most successful show of all time. The geeks,

129
00:08:06.430 --> 00:08:07.750
they should just call that show geeks. What?

130
00:08:07.751 --> 00:08:11.470
The it called with the guys who do the, all the dorks on the

131

[inaudible] [inaudible] the. Is it the guy won the Emmy for it?

132
00:08:16.630 --> 00:08:19.600
Big bang theory is uncultured folks.

133
00:08:22.420 --> 00:08:26.530
Big bang theory on CBS. Not on ABC and not called the geeks.

134
00:08:31.600 --> 00:08:31.750
<v 1>Okay.</v>

135
00:08:31.750 --> 00:08:35.980
<v 0>Man. That's so awesome. Breaking bad as the. God. you, dude.</v>

136
00:08:36.550 --> 00:08:40.360
You know? And then people are like, you see the wire though? Yeah.

137
00:08:40.450 --> 00:08:45.220
I saw the wire do it. All right. Why don't you just relax? I saw. Okay.

138
00:08:45.400 --> 00:08:50.110
It's good. But relax. You compare a show to breaking bad. You get to step in,

139
00:08:50.111 --> 00:08:55.030
dude. God that made King speech look.

140
00:08:56.400 --> 00:08:58.620
Uh, what's his name? Stepping inside the ring. Cm punk.

00:09:01.950 --> 00:09:03.600
I swear to God King speech.

142
00:09:03.630 --> 00:09:08.010
Colin Firth saw Bryan Cranston make that phone call to his wife about how I did

143
00:09:08.011 --> 00:09:09.570
it. And you had nothing to do with it.

144
00:09:09.571 --> 00:09:13.770
When the phone was tapped and Colin Firth went like this, I like, Oh, all right,

145
00:09:13.980 --> 00:09:15.330
it. I quit acting. That's what happened.

146
00:09:20.490 --> 00:09:25.080
But yeah dude, I just can't believe good television. Ah,

147
00:09:25.110 --> 00:09:27.480
those haters out there. I could have done it. I could have done it.

148
00:09:27.481 --> 00:09:31.170
You know how hard is. How about the fact that they're the people that are,

149
00:09:32.280 --> 00:09:36.750
that are doing it. You little. Huh? How about that?

150
00:09:36.751 --> 00:09:41.220
They're the people that are doing it when I say, Oh, Ozark is good or outsiders.

151
00:09:41.221 --> 00:09:45.120
Good. Yeah, but bro. Oh yeah. How about they did it?

152
00:09:45.690 --> 00:09:48.510
How about they did it? Yeah.

153
00:09:50.940 --> 00:09:52.350
[inaudible] yeah, but they did it. Dude.

154
00:09:53.640 --> 00:09:58.620
Let's make this money even though we can't right now. Cause the Rona.
