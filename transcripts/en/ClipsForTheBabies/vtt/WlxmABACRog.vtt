1
00:00:01.170 --> 00:00:05.610
<v 0>So this guy, you may not know if you're a young baby.</v>

2
00:00:07.140 --> 00:00:11.820
It was right around my time in the eighties, George Brett was a,

3
00:00:11.910 --> 00:00:15.600
was the man. He was a great baseball player on the Kansas city Royals.

4
00:00:17.490 --> 00:00:22.350
So he became a coach or a, some kind of a manager or something for the, for the,

5
00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:27.240
for the Royals. And there is, there is leaked video and audio of him.

6
00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:30.870
Do you guys know about this? You do, right? Yeah, of course. Um,

7
00:00:31.620 --> 00:00:35.910
where he is telling a younger player,

8
00:00:36.810 --> 00:00:39.870
uh, well, you know what, let me just play it for you. This guy.

9
00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:43.920
Let me just this guy, let me just start. Before I even played,

10
00:00:44.130 --> 00:00:48.780
this is the most, this is more than hitting a,

11
00:00:48.860 --> 00:00:52.230
a grand slam more than shagging. Fly balls,

12
00:00:52.560 --> 00:00:55.260
more than eating sunflower seeds.

13
00:00:55.620 --> 00:00:59.820
Waiting on the on-deck circle this

14
00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:01.320
right here.

15
00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:06.480
This three minutes is the most

16
00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:11.340
baseball thing that has ever happened. Here we go.

17
00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:12.390
It's unreal.

18
00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:15.320
<v 1>Back to the right gentleman, both hands right side, stretching.</v>

19
00:01:15.380 --> 00:01:18.890
<v 0>George Brett stretching. Okay. It's weird to, by the way,</v>

20
00:01:18.891 --> 00:01:21.800
the manager is stretch. There's no reason for it.

21
00:01:21.830 --> 00:01:23.930
You stand around and tell people what to do.

22
00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:33.500
<v 1>So he's stretching. So.</v>

23
00:01:33.500 --> 00:01:35.240
<v 0>Now the</v>

24
00:01:39.220 --> 00:01:42.080
It's so crazy, by the way,

25
00:01:42.081 --> 00:01:44.720
the manager dresses up in the uniform,

26
00:01:44.721 --> 00:01:48.350
which is so sad. Hey,

27
00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:53.090
that's sad. Imagine Pat Riley out there with a nix Jersey on,

28
00:01:53.120 --> 00:01:57.260
is that what you know, he was Lakers. What was he? Nicks. Yeah. Got it. Right.

29
00:01:57.290 --> 00:02:01.190
So of course it's Nick. You know why it's Nick's look at Pat Riley.

30
00:02:01.430 --> 00:02:04.760
Couldn't be more New York. Hey. Hey,

31
00:02:05.390 --> 00:02:07.570
so going on a little Terry, Pat Riley,

32
00:02:07.610 --> 00:02:10.610
always saying that always on the Virginia last night. All right. All right.

33
00:02:10.611 --> 00:02:11.444
All right. All right. All right.

34
00:02:12.320 --> 00:02:16.700
<v 1>Pardon? Pardon? He says, well, are you guys here stretch. Oh,</v>

35
00:02:16.880 --> 00:02:18.440
he farts. I didn't realize this.

36
00:02:21.060 --> 00:02:21.893
<v 0>That's what he says.</v>

37
00:02:28.090 --> 00:02:28.923
<v 1>You hear that part.</v>

38
00:02:29.630 --> 00:02:33.380
<v 0>Wow. Okay. So he farts stretching next to a player.</v>

39
00:02:36.410 --> 00:02:37.243
<v 1>Pardon?</v>

40
00:02:42.740 --> 00:02:46.790
<v 0>For, to not even IFR to do you know how, let me tell you something.</v>

41
00:02:46.820 --> 00:02:51.620
The ego you have to have on you to fart and then say

42
00:02:51.740 --> 00:02:54.080
far too, is,

43
00:02:54.500 --> 00:02:59.350
is the ego of someone who wears a robe.

44
00:03:01.330 --> 00:03:03.310
It's just unbelievable. I,

45
00:03:03.490 --> 00:03:08.380
my pants last night and then goes right into this story. Okay.

46
00:03:09.430 --> 00:03:12.330
I shut my pants last night, dude. This is.

47
00:03:15.180 --> 00:03:19.920
<v 1>Fart. There's a one part of. My pants last night.</v>

48
00:03:24.450 --> 00:03:27.930
<v 0>Okay. So now the younger players, like, okay, and he's just stretching.</v>

49
00:03:27.931 --> 00:03:28.830
And he says, I did.

50
00:03:29.770 --> 00:03:32.190
<v 1>I haven't had a great meal, just a great meal.</v>

51
00:03:32.260 --> 00:03:35.130
I had to go to the bathroom so bad in the car. I'm going to travel. Hurry up,

52
00:03:35.131 --> 00:03:39.480
man. I got in my pants.

53
00:03:40.110 --> 00:03:43.770
I wasn't. Audio is kind of weird, goes in and out,

54
00:03:44.790 --> 00:03:49.230
but it gets better. Just listen. I'm good. Twice a year for that. Oh,

55
00:03:49.231 --> 00:03:52.320
what was the last time? You. Your pants. Yeah. It's been awhile.

56
00:03:52.780 --> 00:03:55.380
It's been a long time. I was in Vegas a couple years ago.

57
00:03:55.710 --> 00:03:57.090
Just the honest to God. True story. I mean,

58
00:03:57.190 --> 00:04:00.210
I just to want to stay at the Bellagio one over the Mirage for dinner and met

59
00:04:00.211 --> 00:04:04.620
some friends of mine over there, went to Kokomo. So great.

60
00:04:04.621 --> 00:04:09.240
Little steakhouse guy brings out some fresh crab legs. It's just came in.

61
00:04:09.241 --> 00:04:11.670
I got to give them to you guys, bring some I'm eating them.

62
00:04:11.820 --> 00:04:15.360
Then we'd go play gamble a little bit. I have a tee time early in the morning.

63
00:04:16.080 --> 00:04:18.540
So I said, look, I got to get going. I'm walking back to the hotel.

64
00:04:18.541 --> 00:04:21.630
I get three quarters away on the lobby. And all of a sudden I go, Oh.

65
00:04:23.130 --> 00:04:26.340
And I'm standing here like this. I got my butt pinched. So I'm I'm.

66
00:04:26.730 --> 00:04:30.660
I can't move. All of a sudden, you know,

67
00:04:31.540 --> 00:04:32.730
felt right. I want just like this

68
00:04:37.590 --> 00:04:38.850
poisoning from the crabs.

69
00:04:39.780 --> 00:04:42.930
Take off my leather jacket around my waist.

70
00:04:43.010 --> 00:04:45.360
I'm just standing there and it's just running down my leg.

71
00:04:46.350 --> 00:04:49.440
I got jeans on black bucks. No socks,

72
00:04:51.150 --> 00:04:56.130
walking. Every time I'm walking, coming out, it's water, straight water.

73
00:04:57.900 --> 00:05:00.310
Then how sick I was sick. I was,

74
00:05:00.990 --> 00:05:03.660
and then I'm standing outside my car and get on my cell phone. I called the guy.

75
00:05:05.970 --> 00:05:08.460
I said, Larry, you won't believe this. I'm standing outside the Bellagio.

76
00:05:09.150 --> 00:05:14.040
I can't move. I got everywhere. I all over myself. And Larry's about a 48 waist.

77
00:05:14.670 --> 00:05:18.510
So he brings me over a pair of pants and some towels and some towels.

78
00:05:19.140 --> 00:05:21.740
And so he, then he comes over and he meets me where I'm at,

79
00:05:21.741 --> 00:05:24.420
tell him where I'm standing. Right. He finds the closest bathroom.

80
00:05:24.720 --> 00:05:27.540
When you go up the escalator to go into the. I can't get in the elevator.

81
00:05:30.690 --> 00:05:34.470
So, so he goes in, he finds the closest bathroom in a lobby of the hotel.

82
00:05:34.890 --> 00:05:38.460
And then I get on the escalator and he kind of sounds like he dropped something.

83
00:05:38.461 --> 00:05:41.250
So no one gets behind me, dude. You know this, I go in there.

84
00:05:41.251 --> 00:05:45.290
He goes and gets the towel, rolls it over the who's talking to him.

85
00:05:45.450 --> 00:05:48.690
He's walking away and he's following him. Wipe off, leave my shoes.

86
00:05:49.200 --> 00:05:51.750
Look my shoes, my pants, everything right there.

87
00:05:51.751 --> 00:05:53.370
The towels right there in the stall.

88
00:05:53.610 --> 00:05:57.800
And I'm walking barefoot with my shirt and his pants that are 48 waist through

89
00:05:57.801 --> 00:06:02.600
the lobby like this midnight, we're all walking away. Perfect.

90
00:06:02.601 --> 00:06:06.440
Double tapered I've ever had in my life. Wait for it. Wait for it. True story.

91
00:06:06.500 --> 00:06:10.400
Wait for it. Wait for it. Who's the pitchers in this game.

92
00:06:18.160 --> 00:06:22.810
<v 0>First of all, should know. You know,</v>

93
00:06:22.811 --> 00:06:27.610
it's his team who is, by the way, who's the pitchers in this game,

94
00:06:27.640 --> 00:06:28.480
dude, nothing.

95
00:06:29.110 --> 00:06:33.910
Yo you could hit a grand slam at with in the bottom of the ninth to win it

96
00:06:34.030 --> 00:06:38.950
behind by three, with the bases loaded and the foot and account full.

97
00:06:39.100 --> 00:06:43.810
And that is not more baseball than that. First of all,

98
00:06:43.811 --> 00:06:48.640
he's wearing bucks with no socks, nothing more baseball than that dude.

99
00:06:48.641 --> 00:06:52.330
And a leather jacket, dude. I can't believe how baseball this is.

100
00:06:53.020 --> 00:06:56.470
This is inside baseball. They need to do a real sports on this brand.

101
00:06:56.740 --> 00:07:00.280
Gumbo needs to be like George Brett, former golden glove winner,

102
00:07:02.110 --> 00:07:04.600
a great manager for the Kansas city, Royals,

103
00:07:06.160 --> 00:07:10.300
a hometown hero for his, for wherever he grew up.

104
00:07:11.650 --> 00:07:12.430
Did you know? He,

105
00:07:12.430 --> 00:07:15.820
his pants on the Bellagio and then they just need to deal with my dad.

106
00:07:15.820 --> 00:07:17.410
I shipped my pants and I was running bucks.

107
00:07:17.500 --> 00:07:19.870
He was the most baseball dressed person of all time.

108
00:07:20.200 --> 00:07:23.230
He wore no socks and a leather jacket, dude, bro.

109
00:07:23.590 --> 00:07:28.090
Imagine wearing no socks and a leather jacket. I, my pants last night.

110
00:07:28.091 --> 00:07:32.830
That's who deserves to, their pants and the editor early tee time.

111
00:07:32.950 --> 00:07:36.670
Nothing is more baseball than playing golf in the morning. Dude, this guy is,

112
00:07:37.000 --> 00:07:38.440
this is unbelievable, dude.

113
00:07:38.560 --> 00:07:43.030
This is more unbelievable than Darren Chris performance in the assassination of

114
00:07:43.031 --> 00:07:47.520
Gianni Versace. This is dude and for,

115
00:07:49.210 --> 00:07:52.840
my pants last night. True story. Who's the pitchers in this game, dude.

116
00:07:53.350 --> 00:07:54.183
We got to.

117
00:07:54.490 --> 00:07:57.700
<v 1>Let me break it down. Cause we just played it back to the right gentleman.</v>

118
00:07:57.701 --> 00:07:58.840
Both hands right side.

119
00:07:59.620 --> 00:08:03.010
<v 0>So it's just it's before the game he's stretching. He shouldn't be.</v>

120
00:08:03.040 --> 00:08:07.300
He's just why'd you do the managers stretch and wear the uniform. Hey guy,

121
00:08:07.480 --> 00:08:08.313
sad.

122
00:08:13.240 --> 00:08:14.850
<v 1>Well you all you guys, your truck. Isn't</v>

123
00:08:17.430 --> 00:08:20.320
part of the left side. My pants last night.

124
00:08:21.330 --> 00:08:23.080
<v 0>Wait, he's stretching in front of a guy.</v>

125
00:08:23.230 --> 00:08:25.780
The guy's face is in his and he farted and he says for the,

126
00:08:26.320 --> 00:08:29.440
and that's so such a boss move dude.

127
00:08:30.880 --> 00:08:35.470
And then the guy walks away. Nobody's like, they're like, okay, we gotta play.

128
00:08:35.471 --> 00:08:38.220
Like you gotta watch a video. We'll show it on the video on our video podcast.

129
00:08:38.221 --> 00:08:40.360
But like you, you gotta watch the video.

130
00:08:40.361 --> 00:08:44.530
Cause the guys were all walking away and he's the manager and the players are

131
00:08:44.531 --> 00:08:47.920
like, okay. Yeah. Cool. And I'm sorry, but the.

132
00:08:49.240 --> 00:08:51.520
<v 1>Stole off all my clothes.</v>

133
00:08:51.521 --> 00:08:56.490
She has 48 waste through the lobby like this midnight got up in the

134
00:08:56.491 --> 00:08:59.760
morning, took the perfect double tapered I've ever had in my life.

135
00:09:01.410 --> 00:09:06.000
True story. Who's the pitchers in this game,

136
00:09:06.840 --> 00:09:07.673
dude.

137
00:09:07.820 --> 00:09:11.660
<v 0>Also, you don't have to say doubled tapered.</v>

138
00:09:12.650 --> 00:09:17.570
The first end is always tapered. Cause it's common out.

139
00:09:18.410 --> 00:09:21.890
It's the second part that is sometimes not tapered, you know?

140
00:09:22.340 --> 00:09:25.640
Perfect double taper. Wow. How baseball is it?

141
00:09:27.050 --> 00:09:31.700
You got to watch this George Brett thing. God, it's so funny, man.

142
00:09:34.490 --> 00:09:38.750
Who's the pitchers in the game tonight. Who's the pitchers in this game.

143
00:09:41.240 --> 00:09:42.230
How old is George Brett?

144
00:09:44.030 --> 00:09:48.200
That guy was the man golden globe winner golden glove winner. George Brett.

145
00:09:48.320 --> 00:09:52.610
And let me do it thing. Yeah, go low.

146
00:09:52.611 --> 00:09:57.560
I want to see the whole thing. Go, go to it. Know the, the text.

147
00:09:59.300 --> 00:10:02.960
Just make it bigger. You know, make it bigger.

148
00:10:03.650 --> 00:10:08.060
George Howard Breck born May 15th, 1953 are tired.

149
00:10:08.061 --> 00:10:08.871
American baseball,

150
00:10:08.871 --> 00:10:12.980
third basement and designed and designated hitter who played 21 years in major

151
00:10:12.981 --> 00:10:15.500
league baseball for the Kansas city Royals

152
00:10:18.950 --> 00:10:20.300
pick the most perfect double dipper.

153
00:10:22.700 --> 00:10:25.820
<v 1>To make it bigger, bro. I'm not a Eagle.</v>

154
00:10:28.040 --> 00:10:32.720
<v 0>Um, Brett Brett's 3,154. I'm Brian Campbell.</v>

155
00:10:33.080 --> 00:10:34.430
Did you know George Brett's

156
00:10:35.990 --> 00:10:39.350
3,154 career hits are the most by any third basement in major league history and

157
00:10:39.860 --> 00:10:40.693
16th all time.

158
00:10:41.060 --> 00:10:46.040
He is one of four players in the major league baseball association history to

159
00:10:46.041 --> 00:10:47.630
accumulate 3000 hits.

160
00:10:48.200 --> 00:10:52.850
