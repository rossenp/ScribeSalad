00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:01.890
<v 0>Just because something's hard to do. Doesn't mean it's good.</v>

2
00:00:02.160 --> 00:00:04.530
That's the whole thing, man. Wow. Impressive dancing.

3
00:00:05.160 --> 00:00:08.280
I'm surprised that's not a, uh,

4
00:00:08.490 --> 00:00:13.380
sport in the Olympics where they, they play the, the break dancing.

5
00:00:14.850 --> 00:00:15.301
And then,

6
00:00:15.301 --> 00:00:18.480
and then people are just like break dancing is just because you're good at

7
00:00:18.481 --> 00:00:21.540
moving your body. Like a robot doesn't mean that that's.

8
00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:23.850
<v 1>Doesn't mean.</v>

9
00:00:23.850 --> 00:00:25.800
<v 0>Just because it's hard to do doesn't mean it's good.</v>

10
00:00:28.280 --> 00:00:32.540
That's the number one. Break dance song. Pup, pup, pup, pup, pup,

11
00:00:32.720 --> 00:00:34.070
pup puppet up.

12
00:00:34.600 --> 00:00:36.530
<v 2>In, in it. Knowing that no.</v>

13
00:00:37.910 --> 00:00:41.750
<v 0>Palpable talk about king speech.</v>

14
00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:46.753
<v 2>[Inaudible].</v>

15
00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:49.130
<v 0>Well, no other podcasts will make that noise.</v>

16
00:00:52.970 --> 00:00:57.200
That's the number one. When you hear that, you're a break dancer dude.

17
00:00:58.400 --> 00:01:03.230
Joe button, pump it up, dude. I loved that song.

18
00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:08.090
My shoulders would start moving when I had that song, dude. Remember that?

19
00:01:08.810 --> 00:01:12.800
No rap. Hey, rap videos never have an intro.

20
00:01:13.040 --> 00:01:16.820
I'm all good. Oh, what's going to be, oh, there's going to be chicks around.

21
00:01:16.910 --> 00:01:19.390
You're gonna be smoking. I'm blunt. I'm all good.

22
00:01:21.820 --> 00:01:24.790
<v 3>Bro. I'll take you back to 2009.</v>

23
00:01:26.440 --> 00:01:30.220
<v 4>Come on with me, dude. He puts in a VHS tape dude. That's how you know it's on</v>

24
00:01:31.810 --> 00:01:33.820

25
00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:40.433
dude.

26
00:01:41.200 --> 00:01:45.870
<v 0>Everyone's a break. So when you put that on, pump a pump, pump, pump,</v>

27
00:01:45.910 --> 00:01:46.780
pump it up.

28
00:01:47.080 --> 00:01:49.330
<v 2>And it, none of that, no.</v>

29
00:01:51.700 --> 00:01:52.660
<v 0>Came through when a baby,</v>

30
00:01:52.690 --> 00:01:54.880
some name of Danny beam send him Raymond and the baby a name,

31
00:01:54.881 --> 00:01:57.400
but it doesn't matter what he's saying. The number one song.

32
00:01:57.401 --> 00:02:01.480
Doesn't matter what he's saying, bro. You ever heard a this dude,

33
00:02:03.460 --> 00:02:06.340
this is the number one. Doesn't matter. What the he saying song.

34
00:02:06.341 --> 00:02:09.430
This is banging so hard. That it's so on. It's unbelievable.

35
00:02:15.160 --> 00:02:19.090
[inaudible] Since from the second, second in the song, dude,

36
00:02:19.840 --> 00:02:23.380
they were like, do you want the beat to go a little bit? And Ella Kodu was like,

37
00:02:23.381 --> 00:02:26.020
nah, it's time to start. Not making sense dog.

38
00:02:27.820 --> 00:02:31.360
They call me pig. LA. First of all, they don't

00:02:32.980 --> 00:02:35.110

43
00:02:49.090 --> 00:02:50.680

51
00:03:25.170 --> 00:03:26.003

52
00:03:28.650 --> 00:03:33.270
<v 2>This podcast makes no sense. NPR.</v>

<v 0>You LL cool. J they call me big LA. Call me big LA.</v>

56
00:03:47.640 --> 00:03:51.270
When you see me on the street, call me big Salai. I swear to God.

57
00:03:51.271 --> 00:03:56.220
Call me big Salai. I'll kiss your mouth Corona virus or not Dick on your nut.

58
00:03:56.430 --> 00:04:00.100
I don't give a. One time.

59
00:04:00.101 --> 00:04:03.100
I took a picture off the side of the comedy store and a 65 year old woman said,

60
00:04:03.101 --> 00:04:06.250
can I get a picture? And I said, sure. And gave her phone to another person.

61
00:04:06.280 --> 00:04:08.140
They took a shot. And right before they took a shot,

62
00:04:08.560 --> 00:04:11.290
she grabbed my real hard and honked it.

63
00:04:11.980 --> 00:04:14.680
And I forgot about it for years.

64
00:04:15.880 --> 00:04:17.560
That's how gangster I am. Dude.

65
00:04:18.340 --> 00:04:21.940
<v 3>They call me. No they don't. Yeah, they just showed.</v>

66
00:04:21.940 --> 00:04:23.860
<v 0>Yeah, they do. I don't give a. Yeah,</v>

67
00:04:23.861 --> 00:04:27.010
they do one fire keeps telling me do ads,

68
00:04:27.160 --> 00:04:32.080
but I'm on this LL cool J tip dude. They call me.

69
00:04:34.570 --> 00:04:36.850
<v 2>About when people do this dance, when they pretend like.</v>

70
00:04:38.770 --> 00:04:39.670
<v 0>When they do like, oh.</v>

71
00:04:39.940 --> 00:04:43.000
When the guy comes to the circle and he pretends to pull his heart out and he's

72
00:04:43.001 --> 00:04:44.860
not even touching his bro,

73
00:04:45.130 --> 00:04:49.180
if you're a break dancer and everyone's doing the twisties and and they're on

74
00:04:49.181 --> 00:04:53.050
their tailbone twisting around and on one hand and they do the thing where they

75
00:04:53.051 --> 00:04:56.860
split the legs on one hand and they do a handstand. That's cool.

76
00:04:57.010 --> 00:04:59.230
That's all fun and games. And that's great.

77
00:04:59.890 --> 00:05:03.760
But when a guy comes up and does little baby, baby robot steps,

78
00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:07.300
like a twisty, like one of those monkey symbol things, when they do the,

79
00:05:07.360 --> 00:05:10.750
the twist and fun things. And when a guy comes up and does a little,

80
00:05:10.751 --> 00:05:12.700
like he's a robot and then.

81
00:05:15.660 --> 00:05:20.170
<v 1>Makes his chest, not.</v>

82
00:05:20.170 --> 00:05:23.650
<v 0>Concave, but what's the other pumps his chest with the, with the,</v>

83
00:05:23.710 --> 00:05:27.460
with the fingers without even touching it, bro. When a guy does that,

84
00:05:28.900 --> 00:05:33.430
they call me that guy's big, Sally.

85
00:05:33.900 --> 00:05:37.240
I swear to God, the guy who does that dance over, he goes, you go home.

86
00:05:37.450 --> 00:05:39.760
You do one pump. Oh. He did it. That's it. Well, let's go home.

87
00:05:39.761 --> 00:05:42.790
I don't care if we're at a, it doesn't matter. If we're at the dig concert,

88
00:05:44.590 --> 00:05:47.740
stop, break, dancing, you know, spinning around, get a job.

89
00:05:48.130 --> 00:05:51.490
These just spinning around 34 year old,

90
00:05:51.491 --> 00:05:55.660
just spinning the around in loose fitting clothing.

91
00:05:55.900 --> 00:05:59.090
Just how loose, Hey dancers, how loose can you get your clothes?

92
00:05:59.150 --> 00:06:03.500
We get it through so many dancers dress in like Colby jerseys and like big sweat

93
00:06:03.501 --> 00:06:07.760
pants that they got from like, oh, this, this, I paid $15 for it.

94
00:06:07.810 --> 00:06:09.710
It really it's nothing. It's no big deal, but you're fashionable,

95
00:06:09.711 --> 00:06:12.560
but you're not fashionable, but you're fashionable. All right. Big Salai

96
00:06:14.090 --> 00:06:17.630
pro ELA coaches that I did a one. I did lip sync, battle. Forget it, dude,

97
00:06:17.631 --> 00:06:20.030
that guy, you know what we were doing, you know what he would say?

98
00:06:20.031 --> 00:06:21.050
We were doing clowning.
