00:00:00.480 --> 00:00:04.810
<v 0>The top that's like at the end of the F uh, uh,</v>

2
00:00:05.580 --> 00:00:09.810
uh, uh, what's that Matthew McConaughey movie in court,

3
00:00:09.840 --> 00:00:13.380
where you got big and famous for it, time to kill. Is that what it was?

4
00:00:13.590 --> 00:00:15.600
And he's just like going on and on,

5
00:00:15.660 --> 00:00:18.240
and then your daughter was raped and then she was killed and then she was beat

6
00:00:18.241 --> 00:00:21.090
up. And then now imagine now,

7
00:00:21.091 --> 00:00:25.710
imagine she was wide at the end and you were just like, Oh man, chilling.

8
00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:27.240
That's what it was for me when I did that.

9
00:00:27.600 --> 00:00:29.760
And then my noses chapter am I lifted, Chapman knows Jeff.

10
00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:32.640
Now imagine it's at the top and.

11
00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:33.750
<v 1>Everyone goes awesome.</v>

12
00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:40.590
<v 0>Guilty cook, cook, cook cook. Yup. That's me, dude.</v>

13
00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:47.130
McConnell has lost his mind do it. His Instagram is just,

14
00:00:48.720 --> 00:00:53.460
absolutely in charge. Matthew McConaughey.

15
00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:59.040
Instagram is saying charge, bro.

16
00:00:59.490 --> 00:01:04.110
Let's just go look at some of his stuff, man. He makes Garth Brooks look like a

17
00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:06.600
twin. This guy.

18
00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:11.240
<v 1>Christmas happy holiday season. Um, as we approach Christmas.</v>

19
00:01:11.241 --> 00:01:15.500
So I'm going to have it back home with my family, my brother and my mother.

20
00:01:15.860 --> 00:01:20.180
So someone asked me today like, Oh, so from when to, when do you open presents?

21
00:01:20.181 --> 00:01:23.960
Is it one hour from like eight to 9:00 AM, 10 to 11:00 AM.

22
00:01:24.530 --> 00:01:27.140
And I was reminded of, since my mother's going to be there,

23
00:01:27.650 --> 00:01:29.960
we're probably going over in present from 9:00 AM.

24
00:01:30.140 --> 00:01:32.570
Till about 6:00 PM would be a full work day.

25
00:01:33.890 --> 00:01:38.690
My mother demands that everyone open one precedent

26
00:01:38.780 --> 00:01:42.830
at a time and everyone else watch and Ooh, and ah,

27
00:01:43.010 --> 00:01:47.690
and guess what it is and celebrate that person's gift the problem with that

28
00:01:49.250 --> 00:01:50.600
family at least eight or more.

29
00:01:50.990 --> 00:01:55.250
And you're opening one at a time and everyone's watching somebody opened that

30
00:01:55.251 --> 00:01:57.950
gift and then somebody doesn't want to tear the wrapping paper.

31
00:01:57.951 --> 00:02:01.880
So they open it up real slow right here. It could be a nine hour day.

32
00:02:02.630 --> 00:02:05.390
Wish me luck. Hope you get good presents too.

33
00:02:06.100 --> 00:02:11.030
<v 0>Oh, killing dude. Absolutely murdering open mic.</v>

34
00:02:11.420 --> 00:02:14.360
That would be an open mic joke. And Matthew McConaughey just killed it.

35
00:02:14.390 --> 00:02:19.070
And guess if he's wearing a blue suit with a blue vest under it

36
00:02:19.130 --> 00:02:22.730
and a blue undershirt with a white color dude,

37
00:02:23.690 --> 00:02:27.620
guess if that is true and if you guess yes, you'd be right, dude.

38
00:02:28.010 --> 00:02:32.840
It is so, it is so

39
00:02:34.490 --> 00:02:39.380
Texan and also Connecticut to wear a blue button down with a white collar.

40
00:02:39.530 --> 00:02:43.190
It is so unbelievable.

41
00:02:43.910 --> 00:02:47.510
Matthew McConaughey. I'm telling you,

42
00:02:47.511 --> 00:02:52.070
I can't wait until I'm this kind of famous

43
00:02:53.450 --> 00:02:56.090
and I will be dude, just so I can do these kinds of things,

44
00:02:58.250 --> 00:03:02.200
bro. Now the problem is, you know,

45
00:03:02.230 --> 00:03:05.920
when he does the real let's just look at his Instagram, everything.

46
00:03:06.190 --> 00:03:09.910
He's just so great, man, by the way, big, phenomenal actor,

47
00:03:10.300 --> 00:03:15.280
like straight up busting his balls, but the best just real good.

48
00:03:16.150 --> 00:03:19.630
And if anyone says he's not good, eat a Dick now,

49
00:03:19.660 --> 00:03:22.360
does he dress like a Superman villain? Yes.

50
00:03:22.570 --> 00:03:27.550
Always to look at this green jacket, he has an Instagram with the green tone,

51
00:03:27.670 --> 00:03:28.900
like bro, I got to get a turtleneck, man.

52
00:03:29.350 --> 00:03:32.710
I swear I put on a turtleneck the other day and, and everyone went,

53
00:03:32.980 --> 00:03:37.270
Oh, I didn't buy it because it was.

54
00:03:38.820 --> 00:03:40.020
<v 2>Bro. I put on a turtleneck.</v>

55
00:03:41.370 --> 00:03:42.540
<v 0>Uh, two grand,</v>

56
00:03:43.710 --> 00:03:46.410
it was two grand and I go like this K not going to buy this.

57
00:03:50.640 --> 00:03:53.520
Wow. There's a picture of Matthew McConaughey on his Instagram with Matthew

58
00:03:53.521 --> 00:03:57.870
McConaughey and, and, and uh, what's it Woody Harrelson in, uh,

59
00:03:57.930 --> 00:04:00.090
in a Lake. Of course there is

60
00:04:02.340 --> 00:04:03.091
one thing's for sure.

61
00:04:03.091 --> 00:04:08.010
Matthew McConaughey has never a guy he's had sex with 40 women and that's,

62
00:04:08.011 --> 00:04:09.600
it could have had sex with way more, but he's just,

63
00:04:09.820 --> 00:04:12.570
it's just not the kind of guy. I'm just not the kind of style I do

64
00:04:14.550 --> 00:04:19.470
always rolling a bugger to when he's talking one time when I

65
00:04:19.471 --> 00:04:21.270
was in my, in my, when I was in high school,

66
00:04:21.300 --> 00:04:23.880
my girlfriend broke up with me and broke my heart.

67
00:04:24.060 --> 00:04:28.170
And then she started dating a Mormon guy and sh and she said he reminded her of

68
00:04:28.171 --> 00:04:30.660
Matthew McConaughey and ever since then, I think about that all the time.

69
00:04:30.661 --> 00:04:33.840
And it's all good. So anyway, it's all good. Now did she say,

70
00:04:34.170 --> 00:04:38.310
cause his voice sounded like warm molasses and that's such a stupid thing to say

71
00:04:38.311 --> 00:04:42.390
for a 18 year old. Yes. Is it all right? It is now. Was it.

72
00:04:42.630 --> 00:04:47.520
<v 2>A few years now?</v>

73
00:04:47.521 --> 00:04:52.170
The problem is not a problem, man.

74
00:04:53.280 --> 00:04:54.090
20.

75
00:04:54.090 --> 00:04:56.220
<v 0>Getting a blow job in the beginning of the movie.</v>

76
00:04:56.730 --> 00:05:00.040
If you're watching it in the beginning of, he goes like this 2020,

77
00:05:00.390 --> 00:05:03.570
getting sucked and doesn't show the, it doesn't show his waste.

78
00:05:03.690 --> 00:05:04.523
Cause he's getting sucked.

79
00:05:06.150 --> 00:05:09.480
<v 2>Hello? Well, 2019 was.</v>

80
00:05:09.640 --> 00:05:13.200
<v 0>Always shot. Every Instagram video he's ever done twice.</v>

81
00:05:13.530 --> 00:05:16.260
He did it once and he goes, nah, I don't like that one. Let's try it again.

82
00:05:16.261 --> 00:05:18.150
And then did it. And then was like, yeah, that's fine.

83
00:05:18.510 --> 00:05:21.210
And he always thought I could do a better, but what am I going to keep doing it?

84
00:05:21.750 --> 00:05:22.590
<v 2>He thought, every time</v>

85
00:05:25.080 --> 00:05:29.490
I know this dude, this is the important in life, man.

86
00:05:29.610 --> 00:05:34.200
This is the important in life. It's not what the warrant it ran.

87
00:05:34.380 --> 00:05:35.213
It's not the.

88
00:05:35.640 --> 00:05:37.920
<v 0>You know, I mean the Australia fires are pretty important,</v>

89
00:05:37.921 --> 00:05:39.780
but this is the important, dude.

90
00:05:40.950 --> 00:05:44.370
<v 2>We don't really know what's going on out there. We don't know.</v>

91
00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:49.080
Do you really know if we should be at war with Iran or not? Do you really know?

92
00:05:49.500 --> 00:05:52.110
You got Fox news saying one thing you got CNN saying the other thing,

93
00:05:52.290 --> 00:05:53.970
but you got me telling you.

94
00:05:54.030 --> 00:05:57.260
I know for a fact just by looking at it that Matthew McConaughey only films,

95
00:05:57.261 --> 00:05:58.340
Instagram videos twice.

96
00:05:59.030 --> 00:06:00.560
<v 0>That's the we need to know.</v>

97
00:06:00.910 --> 00:06:02.350
<v 3>Let's start there, dude.</v>

98
00:06:11.740 --> 00:06:12.880
[inaudible] set it on Instagram.

99
00:06:13.270 --> 00:06:17.560
<v 0>Dude. Let's watch it again. The beginning of it.</v>

100
00:06:18.970 --> 00:06:20.740
<v 3>What's that about? Well,</v>

101
00:06:21.550 --> 00:06:26.320
2019 was a lot cooler as you

102
00:06:26.321 --> 00:06:27.154
did.

103
00:06:27.940 --> 00:06:32.500
I'm looking at 2020 to be a lot cooler because we do

104
00:06:33.760 --> 00:06:37.420
running for office, running for office. Dude.

105
00:06:38.500 --> 00:06:42.610
<v 0>Did it twice. Added that the second time. I know how to make it pop.</v>

106
00:06:43.900 --> 00:06:47.200
Did that? See you there, dude. Wow. See you.

107
00:06:47.201 --> 00:06:51.100
There is so something Matthew McConaughey would say at the end,

108
00:06:51.101 --> 00:06:53.380
instead of seeing next year, he doesn't like, I don't like it's kind of corny.

109
00:06:53.381 --> 00:06:56.650
We say see you next year. I say, see there, there you see there.

110
00:06:56.651 --> 00:07:01.000
That's kind of one of my things. If 2019 was be a lot cooler.

111
00:07:01.001 --> 00:07:01.834
If you did

112
00:07:03.280 --> 00:07:07.090
220 was a lot cooler of luck cooler. He did it.

113
00:07:07.690 --> 00:07:11.770
A lot of cooler coolers get our coolers 2020,

114
00:07:12.670 --> 00:07:14.980
but Bayer coolers put beer in our cooler

115
00:07:18.010 --> 00:07:21.460
and then somebody just comments. My platonic love heart eyes.

116
00:07:21.670 --> 00:07:25.390
K what's going on? You brain broken dude. So many people's brains are broken.

117
00:07:25.420 --> 00:07:26.253
It's unbelievable.

118
00:07:26.530 --> 00:07:31.150
It's unbelievable that people's brains are broken for real.

119
00:07:32.410 --> 00:07:37.120
Uh, uh, what's Tom Hanks, his son Chet,

120
00:07:37.690 --> 00:07:40.690
Chet, Hanks, Chet Hanks.

121
00:07:41.530 --> 00:07:45.370
Did you see what he said at some Bomba clot?

122
00:07:46.750 --> 00:07:51.070
Hmm. Well, uh, what happened? Whitney's sent this to me. Hold on.

123
00:07:52.090 --> 00:07:56.740
Where is it? Why? Why is Tom [inaudible] chat? Speaking

00:08:00.550 --> 00:08:02.890
Patois. Cool. It's French. Um.

128
00:08:20.710 --> 00:08:25.240
like golden gloves as the whitest thing ever.

129
00:08:26.620 --> 00:08:27.453

136
00:09:04.910 --> 00:09:08.630
it was a big part to are like this. That was why Tom Hanks was making that face.

137
00:09:08.631 --> 00:09:11.030
It was just delayed by the way, at the golden gloves when he was like,
