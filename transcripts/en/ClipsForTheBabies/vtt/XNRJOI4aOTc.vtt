00:00:00.330 --> 00:00:02.490
<v 0>Um, so Hollywood, I moved to France. Do you understand me?</v>

2
00:00:03.690 --> 00:00:08.640
I moved next to Johnny Depp in France. Um, your boys,

3
00:00:08.641 --> 00:00:11.310
Hollywood man, people that think Hollywood is bad.

4
00:00:11.340 --> 00:00:14.160
People think Hollywood is evil, bro, whatever you think that is.

5
00:00:14.161 --> 00:00:14.994
That's what I am.

6
00:00:15.300 --> 00:00:18.930
It's so annoying when people say that people think something extra is going on

7
00:00:18.931 --> 00:00:19.764
in Hollywood.

8
00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:24.600
It's so annoying how dumb people are when people think something extra is going

9
00:00:24.601 --> 00:00:28.080
on in Hollywood. Like how it's like,

10
00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:32.330
uh, Oh, well, you know that there's a, uh,

11
00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:36.510
a ring of pedophilia that people, Oh really? Dude. Oh,

12
00:00:36.511 --> 00:00:38.880
there's a ring of pedophilia that,

13
00:00:38.881 --> 00:00:43.800
that top producers know about and confide in each other in and keep

14
00:00:43.830 --> 00:00:46.440
kids and pass them around and them over.

15
00:00:49.250 --> 00:00:53.270
<v 1>Oh yeah. Or are you just bored and sitting down a lot?</v>

16
00:00:53.360 --> 00:00:55.010
Ah.

17
00:00:56.240 --> 00:01:00.380
<v 0>Dude, there's no pizza gate, man.</v>

18
00:01:00.770 --> 00:01:02.270
People think Hollywood, well, you know,

19
00:01:02.271 --> 00:01:05.000
they got into Hollywood so they could kids. You know that, right.

20
00:01:05.210 --> 00:01:09.890
People look in your eyes and say that and you'll be like, Oh really?

21
00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:14.840
Or do they just produce bad boys, dude,

22
00:01:15.220 --> 00:01:17.300
do you know how bored you have? Look, let me tell you something, man.

23
00:01:17.420 --> 00:01:21.470
And I'm not even will Smith level. I'm not stupid Spielberg's level. You know?

24
00:01:22.220 --> 00:01:24.740
I mean, but dude,

25
00:01:24.890 --> 00:01:29.240
if there was some extra going on, I'd have heard of it.

26
00:01:29.660 --> 00:01:34.550
I'm telling you right now. Cause this is your trusted news news news source.

27
00:01:35.180 --> 00:01:37.520
If you want shots, you come to congratulations.

28
00:01:38.150 --> 00:01:42.140
Calore but if you want trusted news, NPR,

29
00:01:42.230 --> 00:01:45.440
you come to your boy and I will set you straight, dude.

30
00:01:46.190 --> 00:01:50.750
There's nothing going on in Hollywood except for, and action.

31
00:01:51.140 --> 00:01:55.040
That's all that's happened. Sure. Every now and then there's a Harvey Weinstein.

32
00:01:55.910 --> 00:02:00.260
You understand every now and then there's a Harvard Weinstein.

33
00:02:00.500 --> 00:02:04.700
Okay. Every now and then, but that's just like in real life, in real life,

34
00:02:04.701 --> 00:02:08.840
sometimes there's bad guys, but anytime it's Kevin Spacey pops up.

35
00:02:09.680 --> 00:02:10.161
<v 1>Well, you know,</v>

36
00:02:10.161 --> 00:02:12.950
he was in an and you know Dave and you know this and that happened and you know

37
00:02:13.060 --> 00:02:13.220
that.

38
00:02:13.220 --> 00:02:16.100
<v 0>It's what happened and this guy was in on it and that's why they made this movie</v>

39
00:02:16.101 --> 00:02:16.934
so they could.

40
00:02:17.060 --> 00:02:19.820
<v 1>No. Oh.</v>

41
00:02:22.130 --> 00:02:24.890
<v 0>No, it was Kevin Spacey probably. Did he pick the part in 21?</v>

42
00:02:24.891 --> 00:02:28.700
Because he was around nine, 20 year olds and he could maybe plug one in him.

43
00:02:28.760 --> 00:02:32.450
Yeah. But does that mean there's a pedophilia ring going on?

44
00:02:32.570 --> 00:02:35.840
Does that mean that pizza gate exists in DC? No, dude.

45
00:02:35.841 --> 00:02:39.890
You're just bored and you're sitting down too much. Stand up, go for a run.

46
00:02:40.100 --> 00:02:41.510
You'll realize there's no pizza gate.

47
00:02:43.970 --> 00:02:46.430
I mean insane. This, this, this

48
00:02:47.990 --> 00:02:52.580
notion of, we don't really know what's going on. First of all,

49
00:02:52.581 --> 00:02:57.320
let me say this. Yeah, you do. And second of all,

50
00:02:58.280 --> 00:02:59.800
you, shouldn't

51
00:03:02.940 --> 00:03:07.740
the stuff you don't know is this stuff you shouldn't know now

52
00:03:07.741 --> 00:03:10.320
pull your dirty wife beater down.

53
00:03:11.130 --> 00:03:15.690
It's too high over your belly button. Because dude, if you believe in that,

54
00:03:16.200 --> 00:03:18.990
you are out to lunch. What are you doing? What does that say?

55
00:03:19.020 --> 00:03:23.580
Why are you bringing the sandwich? Oh, cause I'm going out to lunch, dude.

56
00:03:23.700 --> 00:03:24.840
You're an insane person.

57
00:03:25.170 --> 00:03:28.440
Everything that's going on is pretty much everything that's going on.

58
00:03:29.250 --> 00:03:30.750
And I don't want to know, Oh,

59
00:03:30.751 --> 00:03:34.020
you're going to let the government know like Google is starting to attract

60
00:03:34.021 --> 00:03:37.170
people now because of the COVID-19 and some people are like, well,

61
00:03:37.171 --> 00:03:39.450
they shouldn't track us. That's the government.

62
00:03:39.600 --> 00:03:43.140
They shouldn't know what the we're doing at all times. Dude, go ahead,

63
00:03:43.141 --> 00:03:47.070
government. I'll write a list for you about where the I go.

64
00:03:47.100 --> 00:03:50.730
I don't give a where to go. Where am I? My house,

65
00:03:51.120 --> 00:03:56.010
the comedy store. Even in non COVID, 19 related times.

66
00:03:56.011 --> 00:04:00.540
My where even if I go to the strip club, who gives a, you think,

67
00:04:00.750 --> 00:04:05.310
dude say you're cheating on your wife and Google is tracking your

68
00:04:05.311 --> 00:04:09.630
whereabouts. You think they're going to alert your wife, man.

69
00:04:11.130 --> 00:04:15.390
You think the government gives a what you do with your dirty nub.

70
00:04:17.910 --> 00:04:21.780
Just relax, max and stop. Sit and go for a jog. Dude,

71
00:04:22.020 --> 00:04:24.930
go swimming for sake. Wash your hair.

72
00:04:26.820 --> 00:04:31.470
Prob pizza. I hate the name of all names like pizza. Oh,

73
00:04:31.480 --> 00:04:35.700
you know? Cause Joe Biden and Hillary Clinton and they were all Oh yeah.

74
00:04:35.970 --> 00:04:40.380
Oh yeah dude. Oh yeah. Hillary Clinton.

75
00:04:40.740 --> 00:04:45.390
W w w w w had a basement in a pizza shop and was

76
00:04:46.920 --> 00:04:48.180
nine-year-olds. Oh yeah.

77
00:04:48.870 --> 00:04:53.640
The only female that actually nine year olds is the

78
00:04:53.641 --> 00:04:56.940
one that ran for president last time.

79
00:04:57.150 --> 00:05:00.510
Or do you need to go swimming?

80
00:05:01.740 --> 00:05:04.260
Which one is it? Dude? What's more likely

81
00:05:05.790 --> 00:05:10.500
Hillary Clinton's a nine-year-old or you need to get dry or you're too

82
00:05:10.501 --> 00:05:15.420
dry. it up. It's all good, dude. It doesn't,

83
00:05:15.600 --> 00:05:19.050
it doesn't matter, man. You know, it doesn't matter. It's all good. Okay.

84
00:05:23.220 --> 00:05:25.650
But that's the point is that there's not some people who think that there's some

85
00:05:25.651 --> 00:05:30.240
extra going on, dude. You just, you should have lived out your dream.

86
00:05:30.300 --> 00:05:33.060
You should have tried a little harder or something. I get it. It's boring.

87
00:05:33.150 --> 00:05:36.930
You're sitting behind a desk at, uh, at, uh,

88
00:05:36.950 --> 00:05:41.550
bank of America and you Google too much.

89
00:05:42.600 --> 00:05:45.510
Yeah. When really what you want it to be was a rock climber.

90
00:05:45.511 --> 00:05:50.100
But instead you came in a woman when you were 19 and you got a eight year old

91
00:05:50.101 --> 00:05:51.780
now and you can't climb rocks.

92
00:05:51.870 --> 00:05:54.450
So instead you're Googling something behind a desk,

93
00:05:55.110 --> 00:05:59.930
but don't blame your non dream on Hillary

94
00:05:59.931 --> 00:06:03.760
Clinton bucket. And nine-year-old at the bottom of a pizza place in DC.

95
00:06:04.150 --> 00:06:07.510
Do you understand the understand?

96
00:06:11.050 --> 00:06:12.940
Life's just boring. We want excitement,

97
00:06:12.970 --> 00:06:17.590
but it's just boring and that's honestly

98
00:06:17.950 --> 00:06:18.783
awesome.

99
00:06:19.240 --> 00:06:24.130
And if the government is doing something like tracking

100
00:06:24.131 --> 00:06:29.020
us or listening in to my five, people are like, can't trust five G man.

101
00:06:29.050 --> 00:06:33.400
That'll give you, give it to me, man. Hey, Hey 5g,

102
00:06:34.790 --> 00:06:39.550
come comma, come at, come on, 5g. Let's go.

103
00:06:40.840 --> 00:06:42.220
I can't believe it, man.

104
00:06:43.900 --> 00:06:47.230
I can't believe that people will sit there and well you don't, you know,

105
00:06:48.910 --> 00:06:50.950
you know, anytime you talk to a guidance, well, you know,

106
00:06:50.951 --> 00:06:54.130
Y anytime you're talking to a guy and he's like, well, you know why,

107
00:06:54.250 --> 00:06:58.780
you know why? Yeah. I already know why I don't say it. I get it gets cool.

108
00:06:59.020 --> 00:07:03.040
I got buddies that think this, I got bodies that I hang with,

109
00:07:03.190 --> 00:07:07.690
that I like that I have similarities with and,

110
00:07:08.710 --> 00:07:11.650
uh, uh, things that we, what do we call it?

111
00:07:14.560 --> 00:07:17.020
Um, what do you call it?

112
00:07:17.410 --> 00:07:20.830
things that you have in common. I have things in common with like,

113
00:07:20.831 --> 00:07:22.630
I couldn't remember the word comment, dude. Great, cool.

114
00:07:22.660 --> 00:07:27.190
5g is getting to me and um, and they'll say like, well, you know that the

115
00:07:28.750 --> 00:07:33.520
virus, the coat, I mean, you know this right? The COVID-19 virus,

116
00:07:33.521 --> 00:07:38.140
it's manmade that they did it. The, the, the, uh, the military in USA did it.

117
00:07:38.141 --> 00:07:42.100
And they, and they released it in and boom, you know that right?

118
00:07:42.190 --> 00:07:46.270
And they're acting like I'm the. And to that guy, I just go like this. Oh yeah.

119
00:07:47.500 --> 00:07:50.200
Because you know why that guy,

120
00:07:50.560 --> 00:07:52.960
12 years ago his brain went like this.

121
00:07:56.620 --> 00:08:01.270
It started leaking blood. And there's nothing I can do about that. Excuse me.

122
00:08:01.540 --> 00:08:06.100
But is this minority report? Can I go back in time or time cop,

123
00:08:06.101 --> 00:08:08.380
whatever the that movie was, am I,

124
00:08:08.470 --> 00:08:12.880
is Jean-Claude van Damme in time cop? I can't fix his brain.

125
00:08:13.510 --> 00:08:16.180
I can't be like when the guy says, well, you know, whether they do, you know,

126
00:08:16.260 --> 00:08:18.340
you know why, right. You know why, you know what the virus really is.

127
00:08:18.341 --> 00:08:20.470
I can't go like this, hold on one second.

128
00:08:20.770 --> 00:08:25.690
I will meet you 12 years ago and then go back and they'd be like, Hey buddy,

129
00:08:25.691 --> 00:08:28.840
come here and ride when his brain's about to break and just tell him what he

130
00:08:28.841 --> 00:08:33.610
needs to hear. So it doesn't go and then come back and then be like, no,

131
00:08:33.670 --> 00:08:38.320
a lot of were you saying? And they say nothing. Uh, it was from,

132
00:08:38.410 --> 00:08:41.770
it was from a bat and I go like this. Yes,

133
00:08:41.950 --> 00:08:43.570
son-of-a-bitch it was.
