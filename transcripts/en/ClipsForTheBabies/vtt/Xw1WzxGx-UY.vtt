00:00:00.360 --> 00:00:04.860
<v 0>So I did a tweet. This was crazy to me. This is how sensitive the world is.</v>

2
00:00:06.420 --> 00:00:11.000
This was crazy to me. I wrote, I did a,

3
00:00:11.190 --> 00:00:15.600
a thing I put on my Instagram TV and it was a, um,

4
00:00:16.050 --> 00:00:18.960
a, uh, a clip of me kind of just messing with the audience.

5
00:00:18.961 --> 00:00:21.120
You could look at up my, Oh, you can look at it on YouTube too.

6
00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:24.840
And I was talking to these people in the crowd and they were, they were,

7
00:00:25.020 --> 00:00:29.880
they turned out, they were down. These thing called my, not my only fans. God.

8
00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:32.670
Why do I always want to call it that it's called only fans.

9
00:00:33.720 --> 00:00:35.640
For those of you that don't know what only fans is,

10
00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:40.230
you can go on and subscribe to checks and they show you their fried

11
00:00:40.231 --> 00:00:42.090
butterfly and Bobi lobbies.

12
00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:45.870
And you can do it for like nine 99 a month or whatever the, by the way,

13
00:00:46.380 --> 00:00:50.820
that always tripped me, who the is getting tricked by the nine 99.

14
00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:55.830
It's $10, dude. If I ever have a company, I don't want it to be nine 99.

15
00:00:55.831 --> 00:00:58.020
I want it to be 10 bucks. As a matter of fact, that.

16
00:00:58.021 --> 00:01:01.650
I'm gonna make it 10 Oh one. When I was a kid, I would always be like,

17
00:01:01.860 --> 00:01:03.390
why does it say nine 99? It's just 10 bucks.

18
00:01:03.450 --> 00:01:05.700
Why don't they just say 10 bucks on my mom will be like, well,

19
00:01:05.701 --> 00:01:08.580
that's because it's, you know, it makes it seem like it's less money. I'm like,

20
00:01:08.581 --> 00:01:13.080
it's 1 cent less money, dude. What kind of idiot is like,

21
00:01:13.440 --> 00:01:18.240
well, that's cheaper than $10. Are you idiots,

22
00:01:18.241 --> 00:01:20.850
dude, even as a children's.

23
00:01:20.970 --> 00:01:23.700
I knew that even as a children's,

24
00:01:23.701 --> 00:01:27.720
I knew that I was for one of my first words was like,

25
00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:30.650
why did it made it a 1999?

26
00:01:30.660 --> 00:01:34.170
I went to throw my $200 and my mom was like, well,

27
00:01:34.171 --> 00:01:37.530
because people think it's less money, definitely 1 cent lower

28
00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:43.670
Dumb dude. If you're buying some, that's nine 99,

29
00:01:43.910 --> 00:01:48.140
because you think that it's less than $10 as 1 cent.

30
00:01:49.790 --> 00:01:50.570
So anyway,

31
00:01:50.570 --> 00:01:54.950
you can subscribe on only fans for nine 99 or

32
00:01:55.790 --> 00:01:58.280
1599 or two 99 or whatever the it is. If the girl has it,

33
00:01:58.281 --> 00:02:01.040
doesn't have that good of a body. And maybe it's the less money. I don't know.

34
00:02:02.390 --> 00:02:06.710
Or duck lips are bad. It's less money. Or maybe it's more money if you're like

35
00:02:08.750 --> 00:02:12.320
I dunno. I feel like Persian guys love all that. Persian guys. Not only fans,

36
00:02:12.321 --> 00:02:17.210
but Persian guys love the, Oh. She put all that much makeup on. That's amazing,

37
00:02:17.211 --> 00:02:21.680
bro. She's out to go. She's out to go out tonight, bro. Oh man.

38
00:02:21.681 --> 00:02:24.650
She put even more collagen in her lip dog. That's it, man.

39
00:02:25.040 --> 00:02:29.420
I want my girl looking like a Simpson dog. That's crazy bro. She did her hair.

40
00:02:29.421 --> 00:02:34.190
Really nice dog. Look at that man.

41
00:02:34.191 --> 00:02:36.230
Look how much deputy use dog

42
00:02:38.870 --> 00:02:41.270
A dog. That's awesome. Look at that outfit, bro.

43
00:02:41.271 --> 00:02:43.610
She's got three outfits on at the same time dog.

44
00:02:44.870 --> 00:02:48.350
She's got an outfit on and then on top of that, she's got an outfit on.

45
00:02:48.410 --> 00:02:53.180
And then on top of that dog, she's got another outfit on dog and then she,

46
00:02:53.270 --> 00:02:56.510
she didn't even use a makeup dog. She used to paint on her face.

47
00:02:57.260 --> 00:03:01.840
She used house paint dog on her face. contouring dog.

48
00:03:01.880 --> 00:03:03.610
She used the white and black paint

49
00:03:06.010 --> 00:03:10.420
and then she told her doctor to put straight up cement in her lips, dog.

50
00:03:13.720 --> 00:03:14.620
She's so hot.

51
00:03:14.621 --> 00:03:17.830
She can't even keep her head up because of the house paint and cement in her

52
00:03:17.831 --> 00:03:18.664
mouth, the dog,

53
00:03:19.030 --> 00:03:23.650
she basically drags her face on the ground dark and she pushes it

54
00:03:23.651 --> 00:03:27.280
forward and she's sweating so hard. Cause she's got three office on doc.

55
00:03:29.530 --> 00:03:34.300
Um, what the was I even talking about? Oh yeah. Only fans. Um,

56
00:03:37.890 --> 00:03:38.640
only fans.

57
00:03:38.640 --> 00:03:43.380
So this girl was talking about how she does only fans and I knew what it was

58
00:03:43.381 --> 00:03:46.830
kinda, but I didn't really know. And,

59
00:03:48.030 --> 00:03:50.910
and I was like, and she was like, I'm on only fans. And I was like, Oh,

60
00:03:50.911 --> 00:03:54.270
you're on that. So I was kinda like not roasting her,

61
00:03:54.271 --> 00:03:56.520
but kind of just having fun with it and the audience and making fun of it.

62
00:03:56.521 --> 00:03:57.720
It's on YouTube. You can look at it,

63
00:03:57.780 --> 00:04:01.890
they'll add a link or something on the bottom. And uh,

64
00:04:03.960 --> 00:04:06.930
at the don't want fire and I haven't get rid of, but um,

65
00:04:07.830 --> 00:04:12.510
and so I was like, so I tweeted something and I wrote God,

66
00:04:12.511 --> 00:04:16.850
this is so everyone's so sensitive. This is crazy. I wrote I'm on only fans.

67
00:04:16.980 --> 00:04:18.600
Cause it was on my mind. I wrote I'm on only fans.

I guess people think it's funny.

94
00:05:50.610 --> 00:05:55.380
And then people were like really

You can be offended if you want, but you can't tell me not to say some. Okay.

but like to be,

119
00:07:42.430 --> 00:07:43.780

you're not coming to the defense of the people that could come to their own

125
00:08:01.001 --> 00:08:02.080
defense. By the way

126
00:08:03.910 --> 00:08:08.570

137
00:08:57.480 --> 00:08:59.460
If you don't think something's funny on Twitter.

138
00:08:59.640 --> 00:09:02.520
That's cause it's Twitter dude.

139
00:09:02.550 --> 00:09:07.020
All the I say on Twitter is not funny. It sucks. It's cause it's free.

140
00:09:07.380 --> 00:09:10.740
You want to see something funny? Come see the act of worked out

141
00:09:17.120 --> 00:09:21.170

143
00:09:25.230 --> 00:09:29.660

144
00:09:31.730 --> 00:09:36.200
I making fun of me showing my and people are like, you know what so much.

145
00:09:36.290 --> 00:09:38.000
Here's the other thing about it.

146
00:09:38.450 --> 00:09:43.400
If you think I'm making fun of only fans and you're mad because I

147
00:09:43.401 --> 00:09:48.290
say, Hey, I joined only fans. I can't wait to show my for $40.

148
00:09:49.190 --> 00:09:51.080
If you take that,

149
00:09:51.140 --> 00:09:54.890
that's literally what only fans is.

150
00:09:55.940 --> 00:09:57.830
It's literally what it is.

151
00:09:58.490 --> 00:10:02.960
You're paying to see girls show the bits and pieces.

152
00:10:04.550 --> 00:10:07.520
So I'm saying that, so take that out of it.

153
00:10:09.650 --> 00:10:12.830
Like the humor, take the humor, whatever you think out of it.

154
00:10:13.160 --> 00:10:15.560
It's literally what is that?

155
00:10:17.240 --> 00:10:18.200
Therefore,

156
00:10:18.201 --> 00:10:22.670
how are you mad at me for saying quite literally what it is?

157
00:10:27.050 --> 00:10:30.830
You're mad all over the place for zero reason.

158
00:10:30.980 --> 00:10:33.830
And also it doesn't matter.

159
00:10:36.410 --> 00:10:39.830
I'm by the way,

160
00:10:39.950 --> 00:10:44.780
get your money. No, of course. Get your money,

161
00:10:44.990 --> 00:10:49.760
get your money, get your money, dude. I think it's awesome.

162
00:10:50.270 --> 00:10:51.350

00:11:00.890 --> 00:11:03.350

Get $11 from that guy. Get $11 from another guy,

174
00:11:36.260 --> 00:11:39.650
get $11 from the cook that thinks he's defended women,

175
00:11:39.770 --> 00:11:43.790
but he's not because women can defend themselves. And then guess what?

176
00:11:43.880 --> 00:11:47.840
You've got $44 just for having tests.

177
00:11:51.650 --> 00:11:55.930
Dude. I love only, and I love the girls on them.

00:11:56.470 --> 00:12:01.060
And if you're trying to act like I don't then go yourself.

00:12:01.690 --> 00:12:02.523
Kuk.

180
00:12:08.820 --> 00:12:08.910

00:12:31.470 --> 00:12:35.310
Show that to another guy, collect $11.

188
00:12:35.490 --> 00:12:38.640
Show that to another guy who's married and sad,

189
00:12:38.850 --> 00:12:43.590
collect $11 and show that to another guy

190
00:12:44.520 --> 00:12:49.020
who thinks he's defended women when women can defend themselves and don't take

191
00:12:49.021 --> 00:12:53.610
their autonomy away from it and make $11. And then guess what?

192
00:12:53.611 --> 00:12:56.670
You have $44.

193
00:13:01.020 --> 00:13:01.853
<v 1>[Inaudible].</v>

00:13:02.190 --> 00:13:03.750
<v 0>That's lunch for two days.</v>

195
00:13:09.270 --> 00:13:11.880
I mean, dude, you're not going to put me in a hole, dude.

196
00:13:12.120 --> 00:13:13.860
I'm climbing the out that hole.
