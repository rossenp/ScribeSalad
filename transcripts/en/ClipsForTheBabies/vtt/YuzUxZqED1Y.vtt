00:00:00.810 --> 00:00:03.870
<v 0>You know, appreciate you. I mean, whatever, it's all good, but</v>

2
00:00:07.560 --> 00:00:09.540
I don't know, man. We're flying by the seat of our pants.

3
00:00:10.770 --> 00:00:14.630
I've been looking at these workout videos. Cause I work out now by in my garage,

4
00:00:14.670 --> 00:00:17.790
I kind of go to the gym and I just kind of do my workouts.

5
00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:22.860
And I noticed men's health asked me if I wanted to do one of their, uh,

6
00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:26.460
workout videos and men's health. And I was like, yes, sign me up.

7
00:00:26.670 --> 00:00:31.050
And then I was like, wait a minute. How do I do it though? Because uh,

8
00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:34.650
the camera crew is we can't do it at my gym because of the Corona virus.

9
00:00:35.230 --> 00:00:37.650
I was like, did they just does a camera crew corner, my house.

10
00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:40.290
And we're working on like a Raj. And they were like, no,

11
00:00:40.291 --> 00:00:42.690
you'd shoot it yourself and send it to them and they'll cut it together.

12
00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:47.540
And I go like this, bye. I gotta do it.

13
00:00:47.541 --> 00:00:52.100
My self dude. So I've been looking at these videos.

14
00:00:52.101 --> 00:00:53.960
I love the videos. I think the men's health put together some cool.

15
00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:57.710
And then I went into other videos that were like less professional.

16
00:00:58.940 --> 00:01:03.920
And why don't any of these Marvel actors or jurors that

17
00:01:03.921 --> 00:01:08.600
are getting jacked for movies? The, whether it be the rock or anybody,

It's not in the foreseeable future yet,

52
00:03:46.470 --> 00:03:49.740
but dude say I won't be in an action movie. First of all,

53
00:03:49.741 --> 00:03:52.530
I got one coming out called army, the dead, your boy

54
00:03:54.390 --> 00:03:57.420

00:04:01.890 --> 00:04:05.160
Oh, put that down, put that down, put that down.

57
00:04:07.710 --> 00:04:11.610
Okay. That's your boy. And I'm all geared up from the feet up.

58
00:04:11.640 --> 00:04:14.880
I got full of clothes on because I play a helicopter pilot.

59
00:04:15.240 --> 00:04:19.050
So I'm in natural movie coming out, whether you like it or not. Okay.

60
00:04:22.710 --> 00:04:24.060
When I really get the,

61
00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:28.950
when I'm really with the dude,

62
00:04:30.960 --> 00:04:35.700
when your boys sliding over car roofs on his and the

63
00:04:36.150 --> 00:04:37.050
jackets picking out the back.

64
00:04:38.520 --> 00:04:43.290
When your boys got one gun in one hand and the other hands loosey

65
00:04:43.291 --> 00:04:47.250
goosey. Cause he needs to slide over the hood of the car with the jacket,

66
00:04:47.251 --> 00:04:50.700
picking out the back. Say,

67
00:04:50.701 --> 00:04:53.880
I won't say I won't walk, slow motion, waltz,

68
00:04:54.360 --> 00:04:58.350
our car explodes in the background. Say, I won't not look back.

69
00:04:59.010 --> 00:05:02.310
Say I won't not look back. Your boy will do it.

70
00:05:03.300 --> 00:05:04.830
And when your boy does it

71
00:05:06.390 --> 00:05:10.860
and when your boy works out real hard for that role,

72
00:05:11.880 --> 00:05:15.930
your boy is also going to be doing steroids.

73
00:05:16.860 --> 00:05:20.790
And that's no joke. And I can't wait until somebody says,

74
00:05:20.880 --> 00:05:23.130
so how'd you get fit? You know, as of Jay Leno is still a thing.
