00:00:01.050 --> 00:00:01.350
<v 0>Hi,</v>

2
00:00:01.350 --> 00:00:05.520
also everyone stopped DM and meet the stupid meme where everyone says my hands

3
00:00:05.521 --> 00:00:08.760
are tied now. And it's got a girl with tide on her hands.

4
00:00:08.820 --> 00:00:12.660
That is simply not funny to me ever. Okay.

5
00:00:13.290 --> 00:00:18.030
So, um, there's a bunch of right now. That's just not funny.

8
00:00:28.490 --> 00:00:30.530
let me drive by at five miles an hour.

9
00:00:30.531 --> 00:00:34.760
I'm in a parade waving at that Brad and Chad thing. It's gone, dude,

10
00:00:35.750 --> 00:00:39.410
beautiful to with a glove to my elbow. Bye bye.

11
00:00:41.120 --> 00:00:45.500
I don't want to there's that, um,

12
00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:49.190
that they do that all of a sudden catches on like wildfire.

13
00:00:49.220 --> 00:00:53.150
That is immediately not funny as it is funny. Boom, boom. That's it. Stop.

14
00:00:53.330 --> 00:00:55.730
Stop with the with the jump on.

15
00:00:58.010 --> 00:01:01.880
You know, um, the Brad and Chad thing,

16
00:01:02.060 --> 00:01:06.770
it's just so lame. They see white guys and they're just like,

17
00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:11.360
all right, Brad and Chad, I saw a thing on Barstool sports on the Instagram,

18
00:01:13.550 --> 00:01:15.740
um, wherever where they did the work,

19
00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:19.340
where the guys were in a boat and these guys and these five white guys were

20
00:01:19.341 --> 00:01:22.040
doing like silly dancing to these girls and the girls.

21
00:01:22.070 --> 00:01:25.310
There were so many girls in the boat and there was a guy that was all right,

22
00:01:25.311 --> 00:01:26.570
Brad and Chad. Woo,

23
00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:31.430
like making fun of the guys on the boat with

24
00:01:31.431 --> 00:01:33.830
all the girls, man. Hey dude,

25
00:01:33.980 --> 00:01:38.780
you're the dork doing the unoriginal joke from a boat

26
00:01:38.781 --> 00:01:39.614
away.

27
00:01:39.740 --> 00:01:43.940
Wishing you were on that boat with all the girls

28
00:01:44.900 --> 00:01:47.420
seems like Brad and Chad's winning. that dude.

29
00:01:51.110 --> 00:01:54.740
I'd rather be the Brad and Chad than the guy calling the guy, Brad and Chad.

30
00:01:56.150 --> 00:01:59.090
It's so lame, dude. People just jump on this.

31
00:02:00.110 --> 00:02:05.000
I got a white glove down to my elbow and I'm in

32
00:02:05.001 --> 00:02:09.410
the back of a 1960s convertible.

33
00:02:09.740 --> 00:02:11.930
And I'm doing a beauty wave dude.

34
00:02:14.690 --> 00:02:18.500
I'm a beauty queen. I'm the Rose bowl queen on you, man.

35
00:02:30.890 --> 00:02:33.920
I, I don't like when people just all of a sudden jumped to the thing. Nope, bye.

36
00:02:33.950 --> 00:02:38.150
See ya. You know what else? That white claw. Yay. See ya. I don't give a.

37
00:02:40.760 --> 00:02:44.770
It was funny for three minutes. And now everyone's like, what club?

38
00:02:44.771 --> 00:02:45.890
That's the drink? The

39
00:02:49.610 --> 00:02:51.830
dude. All right.

40
00:02:54.500 --> 00:02:59.470
It's the new Zima or whatever people jumping on board with this club, soda,

41
00:02:59.800 --> 00:03:03.910
man. It's crazy how companies can push that. And then it's just so on.

42
00:03:04.600 --> 00:03:09.250
I've been driving, drinking club soda for nine years.

43
00:03:09.251 --> 00:03:12.490
My babies. Not that I like it at first. No. Why?

44
00:03:12.520 --> 00:03:15.580
Because it tastes like absolutely nothing with bubbles. Yeah, it does.

45
00:03:16.780 --> 00:03:21.190
And why did I start drinking it? Because I stopped drinking diet Coke.

46
00:03:21.191 --> 00:03:23.470
And why did I stop drinking diet Coke? Because I was drinking too much of it.

47
00:03:23.471 --> 00:03:28.000
Yes. Was it ever good? No. Cause diet soda. It sucks. Donkey balls.

48
00:03:28.960 --> 00:03:31.570
And I started drinking it because I didn't want to be fat though. Is that right?

49
00:03:31.571 --> 00:03:35.140
Yes. And why? Because I was drinking five Cokes a day. Yes. Because Coke,

50
00:03:35.440 --> 00:03:39.790
non diet is good. Yeah. But what happened?

51
00:03:40.300 --> 00:03:44.800
Why did I stop drinking Coke? Because I didn't want to get fat and cancer. No,

52
00:03:45.010 --> 00:03:48.550
because one time I lifted up my shirt as a joke from a mom and she said,

53
00:03:48.790 --> 00:03:50.710
Christie gained weight. And I said, no, I didn't. And she said, yeah,

54
00:03:50.711 --> 00:03:53.800
I have a scale. Go look at it. And I jumped on it and I was 20 pounds heavier.

55
00:03:53.801 --> 00:03:56.680
Yeah. And that almost faint. Yeah.

56
00:03:57.700 --> 00:03:59.230
And then I stopped drinking Coke then. Yeah.

57
00:04:00.040 --> 00:04:01.750
And then I started drinking diet Coke,

58
00:04:04.860 --> 00:04:08.280
drank white club by mistake. Thought it was clubs, soda.

59
00:04:08.310 --> 00:04:10.320
There's so many clubs that is out there. I don't drink, dude.

60
00:04:10.380 --> 00:04:12.330
You guys know that I don't drink. I didn't never drank.

61
00:04:12.331 --> 00:04:16.020
And I drank about three or four sips of white claw. And I was like, man,

62
00:04:16.021 --> 00:04:20.100
this is weird drink, dude. I don't drink alcohol. And I was just like,

63
00:04:20.130 --> 00:04:22.380
this is a weird drink. And I kept drinking it. And I was like,

64
00:04:22.550 --> 00:04:24.780
does this have alcohol in it? And I looked and it does.

65
00:04:29.160 --> 00:04:31.320
Who's the guy drinking alcohol. Who's the guy.

66
00:04:31.350 --> 00:04:33.120
Who's the guy drinking white Clyde. Even know it.

67
00:04:36.330 --> 00:04:37.163
<v 1>The guy drinking.</v>

68
00:04:41.460 --> 00:04:46.140
<v 0>Man, Backstreet boys made some hits. Huh? Oh whatever.</v>

69
00:04:46.320 --> 00:04:48.960
It's the same one fire came through with the in sync.

70
00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:55.770
I should know, you know, some ultimate friends with the Backstreet boys, dude.

71
00:04:56.730 --> 00:04:59.820
I could call up AGA right now, dude.

72
00:05:00.930 --> 00:05:05.640
Literally I won't because he's got his own life, but I could call Nick Carter.

73
00:05:05.641 --> 00:05:10.230
Now dude, Nick Carter invited me to run reshow show and I said, yeah, I'll come.

74
00:05:10.231 --> 00:05:13.800
Just text me. And he didn't, but we have each other's number.

75
00:05:14.850 --> 00:05:16.440
He was going to play a small get together.

76
00:05:16.441 --> 00:05:20.850
I like the London hotel and I was going to go if he texted me and he didn't and

77
00:05:20.851 --> 00:05:25.350
it's fine because I, you know, kind of that meant that I had plans.

78
00:05:25.351 --> 00:05:27.000
And then I had to couldn't back out of it.

79
00:05:27.840 --> 00:05:32.430
So I didn't text him because it was on him and it's fine, dude,

80
00:05:32.431 --> 00:05:35.910
but we're buds and that's Hollywood, man. That's straight up Hollywood.

81
00:05:37.170 --> 00:05:40.260
That's how we do it in Hollywood. For real. Yeah. Yeah. I'll call you. Oh great.

82
00:05:40.320 --> 00:05:42.990
And you know, immediately that person's not going to call.

83
00:05:45.150 --> 00:05:50.100
Todd's gotta be though, there's too many plans. You know,

84
00:05:50.101 --> 00:05:53.850

if you go to like, they start making plans and you, those,

86
00:05:59.600 --> 00:06:04.460

It's been there in curling for weeks. Yes dude.

97
00:06:49.300 --> 00:06:51.370
All right. It was today, but whatever dude it's I bet.

98
00:06:51.580 --> 00:06:55.870
But we left here for a long time before. Okay. Um,

99
00:06:57.100 --> 00:07:01.540
yeah. So, uh, what was I saying? So people are jumping on that soda water thing.

100
00:07:01.570 --> 00:07:04.600
I've been drinking it for nine years, which isn't long enough, by the way.

101
00:07:04.690 --> 00:07:08.830
I like to, you know, the people who are like, I liked the band before you did,

102
00:07:09.730 --> 00:07:11.500
I'm trying to do that with, with club soda,

103
00:07:11.501 --> 00:07:14.560
but I can't do it because it's only been nine years. You get my, my, my dad,

104
00:07:14.561 --> 00:07:17.080
bro, my dad's been drinking cry.

105
00:07:20.380 --> 00:07:23.260
I had it in his bottle, not LaCroix, but like club, soda,

106
00:07:23.261 --> 00:07:25.780
my dad would drink club soda. And as a kid, I'd be like, why do you drink that,

107
00:07:25.781 --> 00:07:27.880
that doesn't tie. Why did drink that? It doesn't,

108
00:07:28.030 --> 00:07:31.120
it doesn't taste like anything. And he's like, well, I, you know,

109
00:07:31.121 --> 00:07:33.370
I like it because I don't like soda and I'd be like,

110
00:07:33.490 --> 00:07:36.430
why didn't you just strike Robert then? And he'll be like, well,

111
00:07:36.431 --> 00:07:38.950
because I like the bubbles. And I say, yeah, we have a widow,

112
00:07:41.630 --> 00:07:42.463
yo widow.

113
00:07:47.740 --> 00:07:49.390
Um, so

114
00:07:52.180 --> 00:07:53.500
I don't know what else to say, man,
