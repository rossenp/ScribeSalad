00:00:00.600 --> 00:00:04.020
<v 0>I, I, uh, I don't know. It's just, uh,</v>

2
00:00:04.500 --> 00:00:08.760
it's it's it's it's episode one 25. And this is what I want to look up though.

3
00:00:08.790 --> 00:00:10.080
This is the thing that made me laugh.

4
00:00:10.110 --> 00:00:14.520
It's been awhile since I've laughed this hard,

5
00:00:16.890 --> 00:00:21.540
bro. So the Toronto Raptors one, congratulations to run a rapper,

6
00:00:21.570 --> 00:00:25.230
Raptors love, uh, Kauai. Very cool.

7
00:00:26.940 --> 00:00:29.430
Um, it was hilarious how he, he,

8
00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:34.410
he won the game and then still would wouldn't wouldn't be excited

9
00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:38.850
until he got to do his free throw because he was fouled at set

10
00:00:39.990 --> 00:00:44.610
Kauai. But then when they won Drake, Drake,

11
00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:48.780
Hey Drake, I love Drake. You, you, you're not on the team.

12
00:00:49.650 --> 00:00:54.000
Okay. You're just not on the team. Now, when you give posts, interviews,

13
00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:55.740
you're on the team, right?

14
00:00:55.950 --> 00:00:59.220
So what the the deal I get he's a major people are like,

15
00:00:59.221 --> 00:01:02.610
why did he even interview him? Do it. He's right. Okay. But dude,

16
00:01:02.611 --> 00:01:04.800
this interview was the best.

17
00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:12.470
<v 1>[Inaudible] you just got to watch it happen.</v>

18
00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:19.670
<v 0>The six and six. What does that mean? Six in six. So six, the sixth,</v>

19
00:01:19.671 --> 00:01:22.500
which is Toronto in six games. Right? That's what they want. Okay.

20
00:01:28.940 --> 00:01:29.773
<v 1>[Inaudible].</v>

21
00:01:29.810 --> 00:01:31.580
<v 0>Trip to this city now. All now, now,</v>

22
00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:36.060
now what we know right there is he lost all the dads. We don't know. You know,

23
00:01:36.110 --> 00:01:39.620
if you, if you're a dad, you don't know what the he's talking about. Right.

24
00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:41.900
You're just like, okay, well, what does that mean?

25
00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:45.650
Bring it brought a chip to the city. I'm out. Okay.

26
00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:48.650
If my dad was listening to this, you'll be like, what was that?

27
00:01:48.651 --> 00:01:50.060
You get chips when you win. Okay.

28
00:01:56.660 --> 00:01:57.493
<v 1>[Inaudible].</v>

29
00:01:58.030 --> 00:02:01.370
<v 0>Oh, I don't want my, I want the chips with the debt.</v>

30
00:02:02.750 --> 00:02:06.740
I don't want my chips. I don't want my chips with the debt. So dude,

31
00:02:06.770 --> 00:02:10.130
that's what he was saying. Okay. I don't know what he means.

32
00:02:10.131 --> 00:02:14.360
Do you know what he means? Getting a chip? Is that money? I don't.

33
00:02:17.150 --> 00:02:17.983
<v 1>Here we go.</v>

34
00:02:28.970 --> 00:02:29.803
[inaudible].

35
00:02:30.020 --> 00:02:33.080
<v 0>My favorite thing is to think of Drake being like, here we go,</v>

36
00:02:33.110 --> 00:02:35.240
he's walking through the thing and he's like, here we go.

37
00:02:35.270 --> 00:02:39.410
I see the guys and with all the microphones and everything like that. And I,

38
00:02:39.710 --> 00:02:43.430
I like to imagine he was like, I'm going to do my chips thing.

39
00:02:44.660 --> 00:02:47.150
Like on the way to the game, he was like, if they win,

40
00:02:47.151 --> 00:02:48.740
I'm going to do that chips with the dip thing.

41
00:02:50.390 --> 00:02:52.670
Like he's just with his girl or with some homeys.

42
00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:55.430
And he's just like driving to the game, being driven to the game.

43
00:02:55.730 --> 00:03:00.190
And they're like, yo Drake, just maybe to this may the time where they win.

44
00:03:00.850 --> 00:03:04.360
And they have a one in a while and he'll be like, yup. They're like,

45
00:03:04.420 --> 00:03:08.410
they're going to obviously interview you. And he's like, yeah. And he's like,

46
00:03:08.500 --> 00:03:11.710
what are you going to say? And he's like, I got it all sorted. No worry.

47
00:03:12.100 --> 00:03:15.610
I got it all sorted. Cause you know,

48
00:03:15.611 --> 00:03:18.340
they brought a chip to the city if they went right. And the dudes were like,

49
00:03:18.910 --> 00:03:21.940
Oh yeah. And they don't know, but they're saying yes,

50
00:03:21.941 --> 00:03:25.210
because they're in Drake's camp and you don't say no to Drake. And he was like,

51
00:03:25.540 --> 00:03:27.610
yeah. And they're like, all right, well I'm just going to make,

52
00:03:27.640 --> 00:03:31.090
I'm just going to go on like this D this chips run, you know? Well,

53
00:03:31.110 --> 00:03:34.480
I say how he brought a chip to the city and I'm gonna start talking about DIT.

54
00:03:35.170 --> 00:03:38.530
And they're like, yeah, that's rap. That's dope talk.

55
00:03:39.550 --> 00:03:41.530
And then he came up and did this.

56
00:03:43.320 --> 00:03:44.153
<v 1>Why Leonard</v>

57
00:03:54.540 --> 00:03:55.110
[inaudible].

58
00:03:55.110 --> 00:03:59.160
<v 0>You know, what's funny is too. So, so bring them tips.</v>

59
00:04:00.780 --> 00:04:05.040
So bring them FIPSE, dude. You know, what's funny is too.

60
00:04:05.041 --> 00:04:09.030
And I made a meme of it and I made the first one and then people kind of ripped

61
00:04:09.031 --> 00:04:13.290
it all off and. And uh, about the,

62
00:04:14.100 --> 00:04:17.730
I said, hello, welcome, welcome to Applebee's. Can I take your order?

63
00:04:18.060 --> 00:04:21.600
And then he welcome to have [inaudible].

64
00:04:26.330 --> 00:04:27.163
<v 1>[Inaudible] dude.</v>

65
00:04:28.980 --> 00:04:30.660
<v 0>It, so it's either he set it up,</v>

66
00:04:30.750 --> 00:04:33.930
but I don't think actually he decided on saying it while he was driving to the,

67
00:04:35.010 --> 00:04:36.180
uh, uh, game.

68
00:04:37.020 --> 00:04:41.820
I think it took him off guard and he was like, they brought a chip to the city.

69
00:04:41.821 --> 00:04:45.930
And since you know, his music is like, so like, you know, in rap,

70
00:04:45.931 --> 00:04:49.980
there's so many metaphors and he's like a pretty hardcore metaphor guy.

71
00:04:50.430 --> 00:04:53.550
And so he was like, he said the chips thing. And then he was like,

72
00:04:53.790 --> 00:04:58.680
I want my chips with the dip. And then there's a little flicker of like, Oh,

73
00:04:58.681 --> 00:05:03.210
I don't know what the, this wasn't the best analogy.

74
00:05:03.420 --> 00:05:07.950
But what I really like about Drake is he doesn't back down. He said,

75
00:05:07.951 --> 00:05:09.210
I don't want my chips plain.

76
00:05:09.750 --> 00:05:14.160
I want my chips with the dip and then further furthered it and said,

77
00:05:15.330 --> 00:05:16.890
so bring them bips,

78
00:05:17.430 --> 00:05:20.730
which was just in credible dude.

79
00:05:22.500 --> 00:05:26.790
I want my chips with the dip. That's all I know. So bring them pips.

80
00:05:29.550 --> 00:05:33.570
Oh my God, dude. I know.

81
00:05:34.290 --> 00:05:37.380
So bring them tips and then

82
00:05:40.920 --> 00:05:43.410
dude. Wow.

83
00:05:46.530 --> 00:05:47.360
Why, why,

84
00:05:47.360 --> 00:05:51.030
why does Kauai look like you just watched seven documentaries in a row?

85
00:05:51.480 --> 00:05:55.590
Always looks like he just watched like S like seven hardcore documentaries where

86
00:05:55.591 --> 00:05:57.150
everyone gets cancer. And he's just like,

87
00:06:01.110 --> 00:06:04.460
there was a meme where he was were, they took a picture of him and he was like,

88
00:06:04.490 --> 00:06:06.110
and everyone was cheering.

89
00:06:06.170 --> 00:06:09.350
Everyone was like excited that they won the championship and his face was just

90
00:06:09.351 --> 00:06:11.420
chilling. And then, and somebody wrote, man,

91
00:06:11.421 --> 00:06:13.430
courageous are already forgot that he won.

92
00:06:14.210 --> 00:06:18.620
But like he's so in his head dude, but dude,

93
00:06:18.890 --> 00:06:19.723
God bless.

94
00:06:25.580 --> 00:06:27.330
<v 1>[Inaudible] that's all I know. I don't want that.</v>

95
00:06:43.090 --> 00:06:44.650
[inaudible] about what it means. You know what it means?

96
00:06:45.340 --> 00:06:47.380
You can turn your canvas up to the screen and know what it means.

97
00:06:53.120 --> 00:06:55.390
<v 0>Hockey. You even know what he's saying. What does it mean to you? He's like,</v>

98
00:06:55.510 --> 00:06:57.790
it's not about what it means. What do you mean, dude?

99
00:06:57.791 --> 00:07:01.420
It's not about what it means. He brought a chip to the city dude. Of course.

100
00:07:01.421 --> 00:07:04.870
It's about what it means. He's just so amped. You know,

101
00:07:04.871 --> 00:07:08.230
what's funny is all the fame, all the money, all the.

102
00:07:09.490 --> 00:07:14.290
Like your inner dork will always shine through, you know,

103
00:07:14.590 --> 00:07:17.350
and everybody has some sort of version of their inner dork,

104
00:07:17.920 --> 00:07:22.510
but it always will come out if you're too excited. I don't know what mine is.

105
00:07:22.511 --> 00:07:25.000
Mine is not basketball for sure.

106
00:07:27.190 --> 00:07:28.450
But it's so funny, dude.

107
00:07:31.930 --> 00:07:35.110
I guess a championship is a sh is a chip. I want my chip.

108
00:07:35.380 --> 00:07:38.620
I don't know what it means. People on my app or like chips means championship.

109
00:07:40.300 --> 00:07:43.150
I'm a love Drake dude,

110
00:07:44.260 --> 00:07:47.230
that new song with Chris Brown who beats the out of women. That,

111
00:07:47.231 --> 00:07:49.750
that song it's okay.

112
00:07:50.020 --> 00:07:53.650
Everyone's talking about it's the new Anthem of the summer and it's a K it's K.

113
00:07:54.100 --> 00:07:58.060
Well, my chips with the dips on my chips, I don't want to wear regular chips.

114
00:07:58.061 --> 00:08:02.200
I want them tips with the, imagine all the people like, there's just like, Oh,

115
00:08:02.260 --> 00:08:06.010
the caramel garlic. I don't know. But I got it. You got to have someone,

116
00:08:06.100 --> 00:08:07.720
you gotta have someone to direct your life. Dude.

117
00:08:08.770 --> 00:08:09.820
You gotta have a wife for syrup.

118
00:08:10.240 --> 00:08:12.130
<v 1>Partner to the city.</v>

119
00:08:13.420 --> 00:08:17.110
Otherwise that's all I know. I don't let you

120
00:08:19.120 --> 00:08:19.953
bring them.

121
00:08:21.220 --> 00:08:25.240
<v 0>If Jake had a wife at that ride home would be like, what was it? She'd be like,</v>

122
00:08:25.241 --> 00:08:29.920
w w what is it? What is, was the chips with the dip thing a hundred percent?

123
00:08:31.300 --> 00:08:34.990
And he'd be like, what, what do you mean? She would be like, why do,

124
00:08:35.050 --> 00:08:39.070
what is the chips with the dip? And he's explained, you know, like chips,

125
00:08:39.130 --> 00:08:43.750
the dip, the championship, and then the dip. So I,

126
00:08:43.751 --> 00:08:47.470
I went on like, it was like, if chips were that's when you realize, Oh,

127
00:08:47.770 --> 00:08:51.640
I'm an idiot because you have to look at someone's face when you're explaining

128
00:08:51.641 --> 00:08:56.640
it for real wives or partners,

129
00:08:56.641 --> 00:09:00.870
whatever the, maybe you, you know, dudes or whatever. That's good,

130
00:09:00.871 --> 00:09:05.280
but you need to do to keep it real. Keep it a hundred.

131
00:09:05.310 --> 00:09:08.430
That's why I keep it at a hundred. You got, you're not lying, but also,

132
00:09:10.940 --> 00:09:14.600
you know, you could still have a wife and go nuts like Kanye, I guess.
