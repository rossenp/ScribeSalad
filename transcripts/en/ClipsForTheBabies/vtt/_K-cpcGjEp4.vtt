WEBVTT

1
00:00:01.080 --> 00:00:05.400
<v 0>What was I saying? I don't know. I don't give a, man. What was I saying?</v>

2
00:00:05.401 --> 00:00:06.630
Even I was talking about.

3
00:00:10.880 --> 00:00:13.310
Yeah. But I don't remember what I was talking about after that.

4
00:00:15.260 --> 00:00:16.880
People trying to take it down, whatever. I dunno.

5
00:00:16.910 --> 00:00:20.360
People was trying to take it down. It's actually weird. The that, uh,

6
00:00:21.770 --> 00:00:26.390
you know, what's weird about, um, the thing about,

7
00:00:26.990 --> 00:00:30.620
uh, uh, uh, you know, what, like, okay,

8
00:00:30.621 --> 00:00:35.330
like take the guy who got the SNL and then he said the slurs,

9
00:00:35.390 --> 00:00:40.150
the Asian slurs or whatever, what's weird, you know,

10
00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:42.770
it's weird. And obviously, like, I don't say that.

11
00:00:43.220 --> 00:00:48.020
I don't use those words because you know, it just seems to me,

12
00:00:49.820 --> 00:00:53.270
I don't want to say, well, it's kind of ha hacky. I mean, it's not funny.

13
00:00:53.271 --> 00:00:56.570
So it's weird to say it's hacky, but like, it's just like,

14
00:00:58.190 --> 00:01:02.420
I don't know. It's not thoughtful, I guess maybe, but

15
00:01:04.070 --> 00:01:08.660
the weirdest part about it to me is someone will get, you know, whatever,

16
00:01:08.661 --> 00:01:10.730
whether it be SNL or whatever the it is.

17
00:01:12.170 --> 00:01:15.890
And then immediately the next day there'll be like, well,

18
00:01:15.891 --> 00:01:19.850
this is what they said nine years ago or, or even a year ago.

19
00:01:20.270 --> 00:01:22.670
And this is racist. And

20
00:01:24.410 --> 00:01:28.880
my point is when somebody gets SNL or, or whatever, it is a a Marvel thing,

21
00:01:28.881 --> 00:01:32.750
whatever it is, you know, it happened James Gunn,

22
00:01:32.751 --> 00:01:34.490
I guess he already had the job, but, um,

23
00:01:35.990 --> 00:01:39.800
what's the deal with, well,

24
00:01:39.801 --> 00:01:41.690
we gotta find out how to take them down.

25
00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:47.360
It doesn't even enter my thought process of, okay,

26
00:01:47.361 --> 00:01:48.800
let's find out, let's find it.

27
00:01:48.801 --> 00:01:53.510
Let's find out what the let's find out what he did to him up. Like,

28
00:01:53.511 --> 00:01:57.050
I wouldn't even know, like, I wouldn't even know this guy who did SNL.

29
00:01:57.800 --> 00:02:02.660
I don't know who he is, but so say he gets SNL. I don't know.

30
00:02:02.661 --> 00:02:07.580
He even has a podcast. So who's, you know,

31
00:02:07.581 --> 00:02:08.750
he wasn't famous.

32
00:02:09.380 --> 00:02:13.610
So somebody is actively looking up to go find what this guy did to,

33
00:02:13.960 --> 00:02:18.170
to bury him. I guess. I don't know. I want to know what that is.

34
00:02:18.380 --> 00:02:23.150
<v 1>What that feeling is that you, that.</v>

35
00:02:25.340 --> 00:02:28.760
<v 0>I, that, that blows my mind that like, okay, well, okay, so he got this,</v>

36
00:02:28.761 --> 00:02:33.140
I'm going to go look and I'm not excusing what he did, what he said, you know,

37
00:02:33.230 --> 00:02:37.820
it was a racist thing that he said, and that's not cool. And, and I, you know,

38
00:02:37.850 --> 00:02:41.720
it's, but it's just weird that people will be like, okay, well,

39
00:02:41.721 --> 00:02:45.350
what'd he say then? Like I saw one tweet that was like,

40
00:02:46.100 --> 00:02:50.240
we spent all day listening to this, this guy's podcast.

41
00:02:50.241 --> 00:02:53.810
And this wasn't the only thing that we found. Why, why are you,

42
00:02:54.530 --> 00:02:59.270
why are you spending all day to listening?

43
00:02:59.350 --> 00:03:03.190
Something that you don't like,

44
00:03:04.960 --> 00:03:09.160
it's weird as. It's weird as.

45
00:03:10.420 --> 00:03:11.350
It's so weird.

46
00:03:13.420 --> 00:03:15.700
I think people have like this sort of like

47
00:03:19.090 --> 00:03:20.500
weird like, well,

48
00:03:20.530 --> 00:03:24.700
people get it guys get with everyone's is taxi driver character in their mind,

49
00:03:24.790 --> 00:03:27.490
you know, where they're just like the full of scum,

50
00:03:29.470 --> 00:03:32.680
heads, pieces of.

51
00:03:34.300 --> 00:03:35.380
And we're going to take them down.

52
00:03:39.910 --> 00:03:40.743
<v 1>[Inaudible].</v>

53
00:03:40.960 --> 00:03:45.040
<v 0>The eerie as music. This city is full of scum.</v>

54
00:03:48.430 --> 00:03:49.770
conce. What is he

55
00:03:53.800 --> 00:03:58.600
looking at? Everyone's feels like they're looking in the, what do you call it?

56
00:03:58.601 --> 00:04:02.230
Rear view mirror. And really we're going to find out his Twitter.

57
00:04:06.270 --> 00:04:06.810
<v 1>Yay.</v>

58
00:04:06.810 --> 00:04:10.260
<v 0>We're going to find out what he said 40 years ago.</v>

59
00:04:11.970 --> 00:04:16.470
We're going to find out what he said last year about Asians because they cast

60
00:04:16.471 --> 00:04:21.270
the Asians and then we got to find out what the white guy said. [inaudible]

61
00:04:23.040 --> 00:04:27.870
uh, I think he, I think they do that.

62
00:04:27.871 --> 00:04:30.590
The filth, the hook is the contact.

63
00:04:30.591 --> 00:04:32.910
I think he says continent and Whoa.

64
00:04:33.630 --> 00:04:37.920
He says some there's one thing that's like not acceptable now where it's just

65
00:04:37.921 --> 00:04:42.450
like Robert de Niro is talking about. He's like the, the, the PO the DAS.

66
00:04:42.840 --> 00:04:47.310
Hall's the, the wet dugout cons.

67
00:04:50.280 --> 00:04:55.140
[inaudible] What let's look it up. The Niro,

68
00:04:55.141 --> 00:04:56.910
dude, you know,

69
00:04:57.390 --> 00:05:02.370
has the tide now has the tide. Now dude is the.

70
00:05:04.950 --> 00:05:05.783
Um,

71
00:05:06.120 --> 00:05:10.230
you best believe if I ever got to be as big or as respected as an actor,

72
00:05:10.350 --> 00:05:14.520
as de Niro, I would do all those movies he's doing now. Those movies.

73
00:05:14.521 --> 00:05:19.290
I don't give a. What, what is it called? Taxi driver. Driver monologue.

74
00:05:21.510 --> 00:05:26.250
Monologue. It'll call you talking to me. Things are going to come up of course,

75
00:05:26.280 --> 00:05:30.390
but I'm talking about the, the beginning of voiceover,

76
00:05:30.391 --> 00:05:32.100
probably this was this.

77
00:05:36.630 --> 00:05:40.350
Um, they got for the rain here. It is washes out all over.

78
00:05:43.650 --> 00:05:44.483
<v 1>[Inaudible].</v>

79
00:05:48.390 --> 00:05:49.560
<v 0>Seventies, having the long.</v>

80
00:05:51.210 --> 00:05:53.340
<v 1>Walking down the street, this music</v>

81
00:05:56.250 --> 00:06:00.200
I'm working long hours now, six in the afternoon and six in the morning,

82
00:06:00.201 --> 00:06:03.110
sometimes even eight in the morning, six days a week,

83
00:06:03.290 --> 00:06:07.340
sometimes seven days a week. It's a long muscle, but it keeps me really busy.

84
00:06:08.300 --> 00:06:10.250
I can take in three, three 50 a week,

85
00:06:10.610 --> 00:06:12.680
sometimes even more when I do it off the meter.

86
00:06:22.880 --> 00:06:23.870
[inaudible] really fast. And Mark

87
00:06:30.260 --> 00:06:31.093
[inaudible]

88
00:06:32.150 --> 00:06:36.890
fairies core skunk gone too far. Oh yeah.

89
00:06:36.891 --> 00:06:41.480
Animals come out at night. Okay. Not bad. All the animals. Of course. Buggers,

90
00:06:41.481 --> 00:06:42.980
Queens fairies dope,

91
00:06:43.280 --> 00:06:47.660
junkies up deeper sick Vino, deeper issues.

Some there are real round coming, wash. All this come off the streets.

00:06:56.830 --> 00:06:58.540
<v 0>Is, you know, um,</v>

94
00:07:01.330 --> 00:07:04.270
I guess he doesn't say Kuntz, so I have something going on in my head,

95
00:07:04.271 --> 00:07:07.500
but I'm all good thought. He said.

96
00:07:08.410 --> 00:07:13.150
Well canceled me, I guess. Um, yeah. So, uh, anyway,

97
00:07:13.151 --> 00:07:17.530
that's a weird thing. It is weird. It is weird to me.

98
00:07:20.110 --> 00:07:23.260
Like I like, like I understand, like if you're like doing like,

99
00:07:24.970 --> 00:07:28.360
like what he did was not okay. The, the guy say to say that the racial,

100
00:07:28.990 --> 00:07:32.170
you know, but like that Caroline Calloway thing, did you see this?

101
00:07:32.650 --> 00:07:35.350
Did you guys see the Caroline Calloway thing like this girl?

102
00:07:35.351 --> 00:07:40.330
Do you know what Carolyn, Carolyn Callaway is this girl who,

103
00:07:40.960 --> 00:07:41.410
uh,

104
00:07:41.410 --> 00:07:45.850
like got a bunch of followers in Instagram and pretended her life was one way

105
00:07:45.851 --> 00:07:46.541
and it wasn't.

106
00:07:46.541 --> 00:07:51.190
And she used somebody that was like a girl that was some girl that would like

107
00:07:51.191 --> 00:07:53.710
help her write Instagram, captions and build a brand for her.

108
00:07:53.710 --> 00:07:58.300
And it wasn't really her. And then she started like selling tickets to a, um,

109
00:07:59.890 --> 00:08:04.000
uh, selling tickets to a, uh, an event that was like, uh, uh,

110
00:08:04.570 --> 00:08:08.110
I guess, uh, I don't even know what it was like a meet and greet kind of thing.

111
00:08:08.111 --> 00:08:09.670
That was like a workshop that was like,

112
00:08:09.850 --> 00:08:12.520
you you're going to learn how to be the true you and this and that.

113
00:08:12.521 --> 00:08:15.910
And everyone was like, this is a scam. And it's like, yeah, no. It's a scam.

114
00:08:16.150 --> 00:08:19.030
And she, and then she sold tickets for $165.

115
00:08:19.510 --> 00:08:21.940
And then didn't book the venue and then was like,

116
00:08:21.941 --> 00:08:24.340
we're going to have them all over the country and then canceled them.

117
00:08:24.341 --> 00:08:26.770
And it was like, actually my soul is telling me to have them in New York.

118
00:08:26.771 --> 00:08:29.620
So can everybody just fly to New York? And everyone was like, Oh man,

119
00:08:29.740 --> 00:08:33.460
we already paid for the tickets. And you said you were coming to Chicago.

120
00:08:33.461 --> 00:08:35.740
Of course, what Caroline Calloway is doing is wrong.

121
00:08:35.890 --> 00:08:40.060
But also she's weeding out all the people that are first to go,

122
00:08:40.930 --> 00:08:42.280
okay, if you're buying

123
00:08:43.870 --> 00:08:48.640
$165 tickets to find out who you truly are, guess what he had. Nobody.

124
00:08:49.330 --> 00:08:51.880
Guess what? You are basically a rug.

125
00:08:53.620 --> 00:08:57.030
Guess what you are basically, this watch are.

126
00:09:01.550 --> 00:09:02.740
<v 1>Oh yeah. Most come out at night.</v>

127
00:09:07.440 --> 00:09:12.440
[inaudible] so British made it up core skunk, skunk.

128
00:09:15.740 --> 00:09:19.490
<v 0>Uh, is so like crass.</v>

129
00:09:19.910 --> 00:09:24.800
The fact that he wrote that he says skunk pluses, eh, how much did the Niro is?

130
00:09:24.801 --> 00:09:28.420
Like, I'm going to add Scott in front skunk in front of. And of course he, like,

131
00:09:28.430 --> 00:09:30.560
I don't know. I don't know if you need it. And he's like, okay, I won't do it.

132
00:09:30.561 --> 00:09:32.330
And they did it anyway. And then he,

133
00:09:32.390 --> 00:09:34.700
and then he did it one time and he said not doing it again afterwards.

134
00:09:34.760 --> 00:09:38.930
That's what you're using. Um, so,

135
00:09:42.500 --> 00:09:46.970
uh, what was I saying also why what's wrong with fairies? Fairies are beautiful.

136
00:09:47.000 --> 00:09:51.440
They fly around and have wings. I think he means gay, so, so bad, so bad.

137
00:09:51.650 --> 00:09:55.640
So not. So it wouldn't be that way now. Uh, what was I talking about? The,

138
00:09:56.930 --> 00:10:00.920
Oh yeah. Carolyn killer. So yeah, so she,

139
00:10:00.980 --> 00:10:03.890
she sold these tickets and then didn't book the venues and then was like,

140
00:10:04.190 --> 00:10:08.150
trying to be like, this is a four-hour workshop, trying to found out,

141
00:10:08.180 --> 00:10:10.400
find out who you truly are. And like, and like,

142
00:10:10.780 --> 00:10:12.860
like I understand what she's doing is wrong. And,

143
00:10:12.920 --> 00:10:15.740
and she's a piece of flying dog course.

144
00:10:16.730 --> 00:10:20.870
But then there are people like that are like, I have to expose her that, that,

145
00:10:20.871 --> 00:10:22.820
that is a weird notion to me because

146
00:10:25.910 --> 00:10:27.140
Like the writer, it was like,

147
00:10:27.141 --> 00:10:31.910
I wanted to write about my toxic relationship with, um, Caroline Calloway.

148
00:10:31.911 --> 00:10:35.300
And here it is, and now everybody's bashing Caroline Calloway.

149
00:10:35.750 --> 00:10:38.330
And of course she deserves it, but also.

150
00:10:40.550 --> 00:10:40.880
<v 1>She's.</v>

151
00:10:40.880 --> 00:10:45.830
<v 0>A moron. Why don't we just let her be like, don't pay attention. I don't know.</v>

152
00:10:45.831 --> 00:10:49.190
That's just how I feel about it. This whole, you did this.

153
00:10:49.310 --> 00:10:53.390
So you're a horse Kong, bugger. You know,

154
00:10:53.780 --> 00:10:55.400
we're going to wash you out from the,

155
00:10:55.401 --> 00:10:58.640
we got to watch the rain the one day a real ran. I come out and wash these.

156
00:11:00.500 --> 00:11:01.101
It's weird. I,

157
00:11:01.101 --> 00:11:05.570
everybody thinks that their taxi driver is the thing behind a keyboard,

158
00:11:06.020 --> 00:11:07.670
your taxi driver behind a keyboard.

159
00:11:09.350 --> 00:11:13.330
And everybody is the real thing is,

160
00:11:13.331 --> 00:11:18.050
is that nobody, I feel like 99% of people, even more,

161
00:11:18.051 --> 00:11:22.970
they don't give a. Like, that's the real thing they just want to get.

162
00:11:23.240 --> 00:11:24.410
They just want to comment.

163
00:11:24.560 --> 00:11:27.350
Like I was looking at some of the Carolyn Calloway's comments and people were

164
00:11:27.351 --> 00:11:32.090
just like, you're fake you. you. And, and,

165
00:11:32.091 --> 00:11:33.740
but they don't even really give a. You know,

166
00:11:33.741 --> 00:11:35.510
they're not going to do anything besides that.

167
00:11:39.350 --> 00:11:40.710
<v 1>And then people like, uh.</v>

168
00:11:42.230 --> 00:11:45.080
<v 0>Or talking about, uh, Oh, you know,</v>

169
00:11:48.650 --> 00:11:53.060
She she'll she'll write like, well, I, you know, she wrote something about how,

170
00:11:53.290 --> 00:11:56.920
Oh, I wanted to, I wanted to talk about this article and this is my life now.

171
00:11:56.921 --> 00:12:00.070
And I'm going to, she did a post the other day where she was like, I'm going to,

172
00:12:00.071 --> 00:12:03.820
I'm going to do Coke. Cause anybody you have Coke. And it's like, Hey,

173
00:12:04.330 --> 00:12:08.800
some stuff is private. If you're going to do Coke,

174
00:12:08.830 --> 00:12:13.810
do Coke. But also don't post on Instagram by high, going to Coke.

175
00:12:14.710 --> 00:12:15.543
Okay.

176
00:12:18.640 --> 00:12:19.960
At so weird.
