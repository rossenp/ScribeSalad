<v 0>We got some sh some, some dates coming up and all that going on. Hollywood,</v>

2
00:00:03.751 --> 00:00:06.560
California, and wiser, or Hollywood, California. When, I mean, I'm sorry.

3
00:00:06.660 --> 00:00:08.910
It's not hot. Well, I will be in Hollywood, California, but I mean, Hollywood,

4
00:00:09.360 --> 00:00:12.380
uh, Florida, wiser of Hollywood, Florida, when there's a Hollywood, California,

5
00:00:12.381 --> 00:00:15.110
it's so highly confusing. There should only be a Hollywood,

6
00:00:15.111 --> 00:00:18.260
California or Hollywood, Florida, because Hollywood is such a specific name.

7
00:00:18.560 --> 00:00:23.240
Here we are with Jeremy Renner, main attraction, chin. He's a singer too.

8
00:00:24.950 --> 00:00:29.780
Here we go with one of the Avengers, main attraction by Jeremy Renner.

9
00:00:31.190 --> 00:00:35.270
Jeremy ran her looks like a most regular guy world.

10
00:00:35.271 --> 00:00:37.700
And that's why people like him. Cause he's still accessible. Jeremy Renner,

11
00:00:37.910 --> 00:00:41.660
main attraction. Jeremy Renner is a really good actor.

12
00:00:41.810 --> 00:00:42.980
He's actually so good,

13
00:00:42.981 --> 00:00:45.620
but people don't realize it because he's got such regular face. Here we go.

14
00:00:45.621 --> 00:00:48.110
Jeremy Renner, main street, main attraction there. We got about it.

15
00:00:48.111 --> 00:00:51.080
Ever since that movie directed by that girl

16
00:00:52.880 --> 00:00:54.590
hurt rocker hurt, hurt rocker,

17
00:00:54.591 --> 00:00:59.480
not hurt rocker because it's not about grandma. It's not about a grandma with,

18
00:01:00.620 --> 00:01:04.370
with plantar fasciitis. It's about the war. So it's not hurt.

19
00:01:04.371 --> 00:01:08.660
Rocker heads hurt locker. Here we go. Live Jeremy Renner manufactured.

20
00:01:08.661 --> 00:01:13.430
Here we go. He sings too. For some reason, he's not just an Avenger.

21
00:01:13.431 --> 00:01:14.870
He's not just a good dramatic actor.

22
00:01:14.871 --> 00:01:19.190
He also sing songs you would listen to in a dentist office. Here we go.

23
00:01:19.191 --> 00:01:20.990
Jeremy Renner, main attraction.

24
00:01:21.590 --> 00:01:24.680
He's gotten definitely gonna have songs about flying and flying so high,

25
00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:27.260
pretty soon, coming out with a song. That's a guarantee you,

26
00:01:27.261 --> 00:01:29.960
Jeremy Renner will have a song that's called flying too high or something like

27
00:01:29.961 --> 00:01:33.420
that because it would be in an elevator or Jeremy Renner,

28
00:01:33.430 --> 00:01:37.130
Romanian made attraction. Bulls-eye,

29
00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:41.480
there's a joke in there somewhere.

30
00:01:41.480 --> 00:01:43.640
I'm not going to do it because he's a Hawkeye bullseye. Here we go.

35
00:02:02.540 --> 00:02:04.220

36
00:02:04.820 --> 00:02:08.870

00:09:05.790 --> 00:09:07.230
He walks in like that with his arms out.

144
00:09:07.500 --> 00:09:10.170
And he has got the long coat and then he sits in the chair and they say,

00:09:10.171 --> 00:09:12.720
so Jeremy Renner, where are we here? You want to do music? We're all for it.

146

00:09:28.550 --> 00:09:32.360
you asked me what style of music I'd like to make. And the guy says, well, yeah,

153
00:09:32.361 --> 00:09:34.940
why is that funny? And he says, because the answer is obvious.

154
00:09:35.330 --> 00:09:39.350
And then he puts on sunglasses and then takes them off and says, I want to rock.

155
00:09:39.530 --> 00:09:40.363
<v 1>Okay.</v>

156
00:09:43.130 --> 00:09:46.610
<v 0>And they go like this. Yeah. We know it. And then it goes,</v>

160
00:10:00.560 --> 00:10:03.650
<v 0>A guy, he gives a valet dude, Jim inner the guy, well, you got $2.</v>

161
00:10:04.640 --> 00:10:06.860
And the guy thinks, did he make $40 million on Hawkeye?

162
00:10:07.370 --> 00:10:10.670
And then he goes like this. And he goes like this. He literally goes, he says,

163
00:10:10.671 --> 00:10:13.300
Hey, he goes like this. And he, and he, and it's so racist. She says,

164
00:10:13.301 --> 00:10:18.110
this is Eduardo. And the guy says, Oh my God. Yes. And he says, Hey.

165
00:10:18.200 --> 00:10:20.870
And he gives him $2 and he goes, don't spend it all in one place.

166
00:10:23.690 --> 00:10:24.590
<v 1>And then drives away.</v>

167
00:10:28.430 --> 00:10:28.990
And then, and.

168
00:10:28.990 --> 00:10:32.300
<v 0>Then way down the road, you think he think, but you can't tell.</v>

169
00:10:32.450 --> 00:10:34.760
Cause he doesn't say it loud enough. He says I'm Hawkeye.

170
00:10:41.960 --> 00:10:46.460
Oh. I'll do a duet with him. I'll do a duet with him.

171
00:10:47.030 --> 00:10:51.140
You understand me? A God Jeremy Renner, this,

172
00:10:51.650 --> 00:10:55.460
dude. He gets no hate. He's so good. Nobody hates him.

173
00:10:55.580 --> 00:11:00.320
He makes the killer song. And what? There's another song too.

174
00:11:00.380 --> 00:11:02.690
Oh, he has another song called heaven. Don't have a name. Huh?

175
00:11:03.440 --> 00:11:06.500
You said the name before it didn't have a name.

176
00:11:07.220 --> 00:11:09.830
Haven't don't have a name said heaven in the title.

177
00:11:12.860 --> 00:11:13.190
<v 1>Chris.</v>

178
00:11:13.190 --> 00:11:18.170
<v 0>It doesn't have a name. Didn't you? Oh, no. I'm sorry. Nevermind. Just uh,</v>

179
00:11:18.230 --> 00:11:19.760
it's all good. Just nevermind. Just.

180
00:11:23.730 --> 00:11:24.920
<v 1>Oh, I love it dude.</v>

181
00:11:26.270 --> 00:11:31.160
<v 0>Because you're the star of the show, man. I'm talking about me.</v>

182
00:11:31.161 --> 00:11:35.710
See cruelly. Oh,

183
00:11:37.950 --> 00:11:42.590
Oh. Is always the same hair. Can't tell if I'm 35 and 50 Brown.

184
00:11:42.860 --> 00:11:44.540
Oh,

185
00:11:48.710 --> 00:11:52.310
Thanos loved his voice. That's why he was spared from the snap.

186
00:11:54.220 --> 00:11:55.053
<v 1>14.</v>

187
00:11:56.970 --> 00:11:58.650
<v 0>It says, I found out he w by the way,</v>

188
00:11:58.710 --> 00:12:01.980
who found out that Jeremy Renner sings because of the Jeep commercial.

189
00:12:03.480 --> 00:12:06.330
<v 1>Yeah. Sad. White.</v>

190
00:12:08.900 --> 00:12:13.590
<v 0>Widest thing in the world is finding out Jeremy Renner sings while</v>

191
00:12:13.591 --> 00:12:17.610
watching a Jeep commercial. That's the widest thing in the world.

192
00:12:17.820 --> 00:12:22.140
Because all white guys, when they saw that music video, they went like this. Oh.

193
00:12:23.490 --> 00:12:25.620
That's what they did. They said, Oh, Jimmy render sings.

194
00:12:26.640 --> 00:12:27.473
<v 1>Okay.</v>

195
00:12:29.820 --> 00:12:32.850
<v 0>That's the widest thing. The only thing wider is liking an escape room.</v>

196
00:12:33.330 --> 00:12:37.830
That's the only thing wider, Dude.

197
00:12:38.280 --> 00:12:41.310
If you were in an escape room, if they shut the thing and they were like,

198
00:12:41.400 --> 00:12:44.580
if they, if you were in an escape room and they were like, Hey guys,

199
00:12:46.410 --> 00:12:49.590
Good luck getting out more ha clink. And they will.

200
00:12:52.110 --> 00:12:53.610
We gotta get out. We got one minute.

201
00:12:59.210 --> 00:13:00.043
<v 1>No, it's a stupid job.</v>

202
00:13:01.130 --> 00:13:04.410
<v 0>It's just so awesome that he sings main attraction.</v>

203
00:13:04.500 --> 00:13:05.850
And he's also got a song called nomad.

204
00:13:09.360 --> 00:13:10.193
<v 1>Oh.</v>

205
00:13:10.380 --> 00:13:14.760
<v 0>So cool. The fact that he could do any music and he's like, Hey, are you crazy?</v>

206
00:13:14.880 --> 00:13:15.713
<v 1>I want a rock.</v>

207
00:13:21.030 --> 00:13:24.330
<v 0>You know, a gentlemen is a kind of guy who bites his lower lip when he.</v>

208
00:13:24.870 --> 00:13:27.740
Cause he thinks it's sexy, dude. And I do that too. So that's all good.

209
00:13:27.750 --> 00:13:30.930
Me and Jeremy Renner are a pouch. We're pals. We're pals.

210
00:13:31.020 --> 00:13:31.853
We're the main attraction.

211
00:13:35.100 --> 00:13:35.580
<v 1>Wow.</v>

212
00:13:35.580 --> 00:13:35.870
<v 0>I want it.</v>

213
00:13:35.870 --> 00:13:38.730
I saw him at the car wash once and he looked like he was such a good dad.

214
00:13:43.050 --> 00:13:47.490
Hey kid, we need you for distraction. Spider-Man okay. I'll do it. Hawkeye.

215
00:13:47.520 --> 00:13:51.060
Hold my bow. Oh God dude.

216
00:13:51.061 --> 00:13:54.630
These dorks online. Hold my book.

217
00:13:55.200 --> 00:13:56.033
<v 1>Whoa.</v>

218
00:13:59.370 --> 00:14:02.460
<v 0>Um, anyway, he killed it. Jeremy Renner promised to him,</v>

219
00:14:02.880 --> 00:14:04.680
he should win the Grammy best new artist.

220
00:14:06.840 --> 00:14:09.090
You know what Jeremy Renner does for sure. When he goes to Las Vegas,

221
00:14:09.150 --> 00:14:13.860
he goes and he bets and he literally sits at the table

222
00:14:14.280 --> 00:14:18.150
and lets the house win for a bunch for a long time.

223
00:14:18.450 --> 00:14:21.840
For like I'm talking to two hours and 15 minutes,

224
00:14:22.380 --> 00:14:25.860
he lets the house win and he's losing money, dude.

225
00:14:26.310 --> 00:14:30.090
I'm talking about parts of his paycheck. Okay.

226
00:14:30.870 --> 00:14:34.890
And then he says, well I guess, I guess today's just not my luck.

227
00:14:35.760 --> 00:14:40.050
That's not my day. And then it gets up and turns around and goes to leave tips.

228
00:14:40.051 --> 00:14:44.850
The lady, a chunk and the lady's like, God, he's tipping. Nice.

229
00:14:46.200 --> 00:14:47.033
<v 1>He lost.</v>

230
00:14:47.910 --> 00:14:50.700
<v 0>Close to a million dollars and he's tipping.</v>

231
00:14:52.280 --> 00:14:55.880
And then he says, after he's turned around, he says.

232
00:14:56.500 --> 00:15:00.070
<v 1>You know what, let me just play one more time.</v>

233
00:15:01.930 --> 00:15:03.130
<v 0>And he Cassius,</v>

234
00:15:03.250 --> 00:15:07.630
some chips plays a bigger bet than he's ever played

235
00:15:09.550 --> 00:15:13.690
more than he lost. And then he gets 13

236
00:15:15.220 --> 00:15:18.100
and the lady has, is showing an, uh,

237
00:15:18.101 --> 00:15:22.330
showing the face card and he, and she says,

238
00:15:22.690 --> 00:15:27.670
you want to hit? And he says, you know what? The way I've been playing is so up.

239
00:15:28.900 --> 00:15:32.200
I might as well play against the rules. Now I'm going to stay.

240
00:15:32.590 --> 00:15:37.590
And everyone goes, Jeremy Renner, main attraction,

241
00:15:38.970 --> 00:15:43.210
Mrs. Singer did, you know, there's some Jeep commercials. And they say,

242
00:15:43.450 --> 00:15:46.270
you really shouldn't. And Jeremy Renner says, I got this.

243
00:15:47.680 --> 00:15:49.930
And then she says, okay.

244
00:15:51.100 --> 00:15:55.810
And then she flips the card over and it's a six. And then everyone goes,

245
00:15:55.870 --> 00:15:57.580
Oh, and she has to hit.

246
00:15:57.640 --> 00:16:01.720
And she flips a car over and it's another face car and your face card.

247
00:16:01.721 --> 00:16:04.600
And Jeremy Renner says, Hey, I'd like that massage.

248
00:16:09.040 --> 00:16:09.610
<v 1>[Inaudible].</v>

249
00:16:09.610 --> 00:16:13.390
<v 0>And then he walks away with his chips and he comes out of wet.</v>

250
00:16:18.160 --> 00:16:18.993
<v 1>[Inaudible].</v>

251
00:16:22.720 --> 00:16:25.420
<v 0>And you notice as he's walking into the elevator,</v>

252
00:16:25.421 --> 00:16:29.290
nobody noticed until the last moment that his Dick was out the whole time.

253
00:16:33.060 --> 00:16:33.750
<v 1>[Inaudible].</v>

254
00:16:33.750 --> 00:16:37.210
<v 0>Do you understand? That's the, my dream world.</v>

255
00:16:37.870 --> 00:16:41.380
Not for me to do it. I want Jeremy Renner to do it and I want to see it.

256
00:16:44.050 --> 00:16:46.750
I'd start beating the out of everyone. If I saw that out of,

257
00:16:46.870 --> 00:16:51.100
out of respect and I'd be punching the, everybody, and people would be like,

258
00:16:51.760 --> 00:16:53.290
what are you doing? I'd be like, just in case Jeremy winter.

259
00:16:53.291 --> 00:16:57.370
Doesn't like any of these guys, I got them all. Yeah, dude. That's the life.

260
00:16:57.400 --> 00:16:58.240
That's the life in my head.
