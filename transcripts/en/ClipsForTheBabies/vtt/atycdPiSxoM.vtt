Hey Marie condo.

00:00:23.120 --> 00:00:24.560
<v 1>Not a biz.</v>

8
00:00:25.970 --> 00:00:29.690
<v 0>Oh, you can hire her to come, but she have you seen it? It's on Netflix.</v>

9
00:00:29.691 --> 00:00:34.460
It's called tidying up. She comes in and she's like, okay, is she,

10
00:00:34.461 --> 00:00:39.410
what is she? What's her Japanese dude. She comes in by the way,

11
00:00:39.470 --> 00:00:43.470
it needs a translator, which is fine, but she's always like, okay,

12
00:00:43.480 --> 00:00:48.200
I get you. And they just dump out. Get rid of all this. That's what she does.

13
00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:52.550
Okay. Snapped up biz. And guess what?

14
00:00:52.880 --> 00:00:54.230
It's not a TV show either.

15
00:00:55.280 --> 00:00:58.100
It's it's it's straight up.

16
00:00:59.840 --> 00:01:00.673
<v 1>Bad.</v>

17
00:01:01.610 --> 00:01:04.760
<v 0>Okay. Now, no knock.</v>

18
00:01:04.850 --> 00:01:09.320
No knock on the show. I know. I said it's bad and I'm half joking.

19
00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:13.730
I watch it and. But this whole it's one of, you know what it is.

20
00:01:13.731 --> 00:01:16.670
It's the new March of the penguins. That's what it is.

21
00:01:17.630 --> 00:01:21.370
You made me watch March of the penguins and March of the penguins.

22
00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:24.620
You know what? It was penguins, Dick and round.

23
00:01:25.040 --> 00:01:27.320
Just shots of penguins,

24
00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:31.190
each other and walking and waiting and traveling together.

25
00:01:31.550 --> 00:01:33.470
And Morgan Freeman talking all over it.

26
00:01:33.770 --> 00:01:37.130
I don't give a about that.

27
00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:39.560
I got things to think of.

28
00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:41.780
<v 1>I.</v>

29
00:01:41.780 --> 00:01:44.180
<v 0>Got a trial, a lot going on in my head.</v>

30
00:01:44.181 --> 00:01:48.320
I got to sit and watch pictures of penguins or cold and. And Morgan.

31
00:01:48.321 --> 00:01:51.770
Freeman's like the penguins. I'm a notness I don't give a.

32
00:01:53.210 --> 00:01:55.340
I've never seen a penguin. The.

33
00:01:55.730 --> 00:01:59.810
Do I have to watch it on TV for so this Mary condo,

34
00:01:59.870 --> 00:02:02.690
by the way, how's that or last name? Oh,

35
00:02:02.691 --> 00:02:05.330
she must've married a condo.

36
00:02:07.100 --> 00:02:10.970
It's short for condominium, marry condominium,

37
00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:16.280
marry condom, marry a lubricated condom. So not funny. And so juvenile,

38
00:02:16.610 --> 00:02:19.040
that was the worst joke I've ever made on this whole podcast.

39
00:02:19.250 --> 00:02:20.870
It's 103 episodes in anyway,

40
00:02:20.871 --> 00:02:25.460
Mary condo does the tidying up and she comes in and she's just like, okay,

41
00:02:25.461 --> 00:02:27.230
I get rid of clothing and get rid of all this.

42
00:02:27.980 --> 00:02:31.120
Thank this for being in your life. And then, Oh wait, what? Oh, I'm sorry.

43
00:02:31.430 --> 00:02:34.280
Stop there. What'd you say you have to thank this for B.

44
00:02:34.370 --> 00:02:37.550
You have to think this for being in your life and then get rid of it. Oh,

45
00:02:37.790 --> 00:02:40.850
it's a vast,

46
00:02:44.990 --> 00:02:46.850
Hey, you know what? I've never done.

47
00:02:47.780 --> 00:02:48.613
<v 1>Talk</v>

48
00:02:50.630 --> 00:02:52.940
to socks.

49
00:02:56.720 --> 00:02:57.553
Okay.

50
00:02:57.980 --> 00:03:00.100
<v 0>Oh, but the socks are tired and you have to</v>

51
00:03:03.520 --> 00:03:06.400
no, they're not tired. No. Why?

52
00:03:06.940 --> 00:03:11.650
They don't have brains. Okay.

53
00:03:12.100 --> 00:03:15.960
So there's a way to fold underwear. I folded all the underwear.

54
00:03:15.961 --> 00:03:19.980
There's a way to fold socks. Did it? Okay. Got it. Fine. Uh,

55
00:03:21.480 --> 00:03:22.313
she,

56
00:03:23.640 --> 00:03:27.120
my favorite one was,

57
00:03:27.240 --> 00:03:29.670
but it's just annoying how everyone's like you're watching tidying up.

58
00:03:29.790 --> 00:03:33.810
You're watching it. Yeah. Okay. It's fine.

59
00:03:33.811 --> 00:03:37.020
It's exactly what, how boring and good you'd think it would be

60
00:03:38.730 --> 00:03:43.200
little Japanese lady comes in and says, throw away and they throw it away.

61
00:03:43.380 --> 00:03:47.160
And then the before and after pictures look roughly the same.

62
00:03:49.170 --> 00:03:51.510
It'd be one thing too. If she was helping people in mansions and.

63
00:03:52.110 --> 00:03:53.460
So you could see a real difference.

64
00:03:53.550 --> 00:03:58.050
She's helping people in like two bedroom apartments, which is like,

65
00:03:58.410 --> 00:04:02.550
so they throw away a few sweatshirts and some pots and pans get put away in a

66
00:04:03.030 --> 00:04:06.930
lower cabinet. And then they're like, she's changed my life.

67
00:04:07.170 --> 00:04:11.880
We have sex three times more a week now. Thank you, Mary condominium.

68
00:04:12.870 --> 00:04:16.260
Thank you. There was one with a,

69
00:04:16.470 --> 00:04:19.920
the best was she comes in and she, she,

70
00:04:20.280 --> 00:04:23.850
I would like to start by greeting at the house.

71
00:04:24.600 --> 00:04:28.020
Hey, Mary condo,

72
00:04:28.440 --> 00:04:33.090
did you know a house is a house and it

73
00:04:33.091 --> 00:04:36.570
isn't a family.

74
00:04:37.710 --> 00:04:39.510
Did you know the house? Isn't

75
00:04:42.780 --> 00:04:46.350
border patrol. Hey, this is house.

76
00:04:47.010 --> 00:04:51.960
This is a house, not a cocktail party. So she walks in,

77
00:04:51.961 --> 00:04:53.550
she greets the house. She gets on the knees.

78
00:04:53.550 --> 00:04:57.930
That's the best one with the black family dude, they get in,

79
00:04:59.940 --> 00:05:00.510
we reach the house.

80
00:05:00.510 --> 00:05:04.500
She sits on the on her knees and she puts her palms backwards for some reason

81
00:05:04.650 --> 00:05:05.670
and puts them on the ground.

82
00:05:05.850 --> 00:05:09.960
And she sits there and closes her eyes while she greets the house.

83
00:05:09.961 --> 00:05:13.470
Now do whatever you want. I, by the way, love her.

84
00:05:13.710 --> 00:05:17.040
Love how passionate she is about clean. It's the, dude.

85
00:05:17.041 --> 00:05:21.690
I listened to part of our audio book and the how passionate she is about

86
00:05:22.170 --> 00:05:25.830
tidying up is absolutely awesome. It's awesome.

87
00:05:26.010 --> 00:05:30.420
This lady is awesome. She really is awesome. I love that.

88
00:05:30.750 --> 00:05:33.090
There's enough actors and actresses and out there.

89
00:05:33.240 --> 00:05:37.080
This lady is so passionate about tidying up. She's the, dude.

90
00:05:37.860 --> 00:05:40.380
She really is. This Marie Kondo girl is awesome,

91
00:05:43.650 --> 00:05:46.650
but is just like, all right, so she's tidying up. I don't get it.

92
00:05:46.650 --> 00:05:51.600
So she greets the house and the best was there's this there's this

93
00:05:51.601 --> 00:05:56.160
black family. It's like this really sweet family. Uh,

94
00:05:56.310 --> 00:05:58.790
and I just love when they,

95
00:05:58.850 --> 00:06:02.960
when she greets the house and the black family is like so into it,

96
00:06:03.290 --> 00:06:05.480
but it's so like,

97
00:06:05.570 --> 00:06:08.600
it's so basically it was so Japanese the whole thing,

98
00:06:08.750 --> 00:06:12.080
but it's also so something that like white people would be like,

99
00:06:12.500 --> 00:06:16.070
this is really the new thing. This is it. We greet the house,

100
00:06:16.100 --> 00:06:19.100
we thank our socks and we say,

101
00:06:19.101 --> 00:06:23.690
good morning to our ball caps and our pots and

102
00:06:23.691 --> 00:06:26.330
pans. We use them and we love, we actually love them.

103
00:06:26.720 --> 00:06:29.180
That's such a like white thing to adopt from, uh,

104
00:06:29.270 --> 00:06:33.530
from Japanese culture and for it to become a fad for a year and then forget

105
00:06:33.531 --> 00:06:38.360
about it. Right. Okay. But, and black people don't do that.

106
00:06:39.200 --> 00:06:42.830
And it's so funny that the black family is there and she's greeting the house.

107
00:06:42.980 --> 00:06:46.070
And even though they seem all into it, I like to imagine that there's like this,

108
00:06:46.410 --> 00:06:51.290
the, the, the uncle that they don't show like, yeah. Right.

109
00:06:51.320 --> 00:06:55.430
You know, he, he lives in like the side room and, but they're like, yeah,

110
00:06:55.431 --> 00:07:00.110
you could do a show at is tidying up. But you know, I don't feel me.

111
00:07:00.140 --> 00:07:03.890
I got my own space. I ain't tidying up. So if they still want to do it,

112
00:07:03.891 --> 00:07:06.980
then they want to do it. And then that, he's just like behind the camera crew,

113
00:07:06.981 --> 00:07:10.880
like in the corner, just like watching. And she's like,

114
00:07:10.881 --> 00:07:15.050
so it's time to greet the house. And he's just like, and, and EV and the,

115
00:07:15.320 --> 00:07:18.870
and the, and the is just like this. And the kids are like this and the,

116
00:07:18.900 --> 00:07:22.610
the black dad who's practically white is just sitting there like this.

117
00:07:23.000 --> 00:07:25.430
And the lady is like the black lady sitting there like this.

118
00:07:25.550 --> 00:07:27.440
And then there's like, the uncle that stays with them.

119
00:07:27.441 --> 00:07:32.300
That's like the guy that just, and he's just like, okay, look. Um,

120
00:07:32.390 --> 00:07:34.760
and they cut all these parts out, but he's just like, Oh,

121
00:07:34.970 --> 00:07:36.560
go and thank the house. Okay.

122
00:07:36.890 --> 00:07:38.930
<v 1>Oh, she go, Oh.</v>

123
00:07:39.560 --> 00:07:42.170
<v 0>I don't know. Um, what y'all.</v>

124
00:07:44.090 --> 00:07:44.420
<v 1>Just.</v>

125
00:07:44.420 --> 00:07:48.890
<v 0>To say, like, you know, I noticed a show and we go and do for the show,</v>

126
00:07:49.640 --> 00:07:53.170
but speech is thanking. This is greeting the house.

127
00:07:55.630 --> 00:08:00.580
Yo. I'm like, it's all good. You know, I don't want to say nothing, but

128
00:08:03.130 --> 00:08:06.010
just basically it'd be tagging. I know you're doing your show,

129
00:08:06.190 --> 00:08:08.590
but can I talk to you for a second, Charles, come over here. Hey, we got,

130
00:08:08.710 --> 00:08:12.550
we got in here. We got bridges in here. Green houses.

131
00:08:12.551 --> 00:08:16.180
You understand what I'm saying? And you were acting just for the cameras.

132
00:08:16.181 --> 00:08:20.950
I get it. But you need to tell me right now, are you with this green the house?

133
00:08:21.190 --> 00:08:24.130
Or do you understand that? What it's doing is some Japanese.

134
00:08:25.030 --> 00:08:29.380
And he's why people go and take it and run with it. Oh, you. You understand?

135
00:08:30.760 --> 00:08:34.300
We don't do this. Oh,

We thank the shirts. We sh we thank

138
00:08:44.800 --> 00:08:47.710
these. The jeans. You don't need that anymore. And then the,

139
00:08:47.711 --> 00:08:50.770
and then the uncle who is in the side room, just like this, eating a bowl,

140
00:08:51.100 --> 00:08:56.010
eating popcorn, just like looking, just like this. Thanking the of jeans,

153
00:09:42.351 --> 00:09:46.400
I got extra. Like there's a bottle opener right here. It's in my bedroom.

154
00:09:46.610 --> 00:09:49.040
Why the? A bottle opener in my bedroom bedroom. Guess what?

155
00:09:49.041 --> 00:09:52.760
I don't know if I was as crazy as you could probably ask this.

156
00:09:53.420 --> 00:09:57.950
It's a bottle opener. You going to ask this bottle of Abe? Hey,

157
00:09:58.160 --> 00:10:01.070
this is if I was you, Hey, what's up? Why are you in his bedroom? Oh,

00:10:01.071 --> 00:10:04.370
I don't know. I'm a bottle opener. How about that? Mary condominium?

159
00:10:04.371 --> 00:10:05.660
What the is wrong with you?

160
00:10:06.680 --> 00:10:09.170
I'm going to keep this bottle open and next to my bed in case I want,

161
00:10:09.440 --> 00:10:12.620
look empty bottles right here. Right here at the foot of my bed right here.

162
00:10:12.740 --> 00:10:15.500
We ain't get rid of it. That's what we doing. We keeping it right there.

163
00:10:15.501 --> 00:10:19.160
I used the bottle open, open that. And I got to be right here. That's warm as.

164
00:10:19.400 --> 00:10:21.440
I'm gonna keep it here. I ain't got no fridge in here.

165
00:10:21.770 --> 00:10:24.500
And if I take it and put it in a fridge, you ain't going to get rid of it.

166
00:10:24.620 --> 00:10:27.470
And if you do you, ain't gonna thank it. Cause this my.

167
00:10:28.940 --> 00:10:31.040
You ain't gonna do your Japanese white people over here.

168
00:10:31.730 --> 00:10:33.980
And they cut that part out and they film crews, just like, just let them,

169
00:10:34.130 --> 00:10:37.670
let them go. Let them go. Let them go. And then there's a black filmmaker.

170
00:10:37.671 --> 00:10:39.740
And he's like, and you know what the this is, man.

171
00:10:40.220 --> 00:10:42.170
You know what the these doing?

172
00:10:45.800 --> 00:10:48.500
I know you got a job to do and you're holding the camera,

173
00:10:48.530 --> 00:10:53.270
but you notice crazy thanking these jeans. Give me my Jean. These are mine.

174
00:10:53.600 --> 00:10:56.270
Give me the belt. That's mine too. With the jeans. Give it, give it to me.

175
00:10:56.810 --> 00:11:01.760
Don't talk to my belt. Don't go on my room. I'm keeping it. This,

176
00:11:01.970 --> 00:11:05.600
a mess, dude. My phone is walking out,

177
00:11:06.170 --> 00:11:09.440
talking to clothing and thinking houses, green as houses, man.

178
00:11:13.850 --> 00:11:14.660
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

179
00:11:14.660 --> 00:11:18.860
<v 0>Up my life. And he's in his bedroom just by himself at a condo in my life, man,</v>

180
00:11:19.850 --> 00:11:23.870
brainwashing, these. I remember when we used to just save bottle caps, man.

181
00:11:24.380 --> 00:11:28.790
We used to save stamps to get rid of that. The, my purple shorts go.

182
00:11:32.570 --> 00:11:34.010
<v 1>I like not being able to find.</v>

183
00:11:35.660 --> 00:11:36.350
<v 0>Tidy up.</v>

184
00:11:36.350 --> 00:11:40.760
