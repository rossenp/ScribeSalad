00:00:00.540 --> 00:00:03.780
<v 0>I'm back from Atlantic city. I shot some of army of the dead in Atlantic city.</v>

2
00:00:03.781 --> 00:00:06.050
I couldn't wait to get out of Albuquerque and get to Atlantic city.

3
00:00:06.060 --> 00:00:09.030
Couldn't believe I was saying I can't wait to get to Atlantic city,

4
00:00:09.031 --> 00:00:10.140
got to Atlantic city,

5
00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:14.550
Atlantic city and was super depressed because Atlantic city super depressed,

6
00:00:14.551 --> 00:00:18.420
all good. Uh, stayed at a hotel that lost their gaming license.

7
00:00:18.421 --> 00:00:23.400
So there's no casino in the hotel that we were staying in.

8
00:00:24.140 --> 00:00:24.973
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

9
00:00:26.960 --> 00:00:29.060
<v 0>So I'm done with that. I'm done with army of the dead.</v>

10
00:00:29.090 --> 00:00:31.850
I got one more shoosh day I have to do in Albuquerque.

11
00:00:31.851 --> 00:00:34.970
So it's all good going to drama. No's out real good and plenty.

12
00:00:34.971 --> 00:00:35.804
When I get there,

13
00:00:35.930 --> 00:00:40.130
I'm going to get there and now my lips just go like this and break and bleed and

14
00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:44.900
all good. Uh, and when you go to the bathroom, literally,

15
00:00:45.530 --> 00:00:47.690
it's very painful, so it's not good. So, um.

16
00:00:49.970 --> 00:00:50.000
<v 1>Uh.</v>

17
00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:53.780
<v 0>W I got back from, uh, Atlantic city. Atlantic city is crazy, man.</v>

18
00:00:53.930 --> 00:00:55.580
I'm doing a zombie movie. Okay.

19
00:00:56.030 --> 00:00:58.880
So I'm dealing with like a bunch of zombies when I'm, I'm on, on set,

20
00:00:58.881 --> 00:01:01.160
just going for some reason,

21
00:01:01.161 --> 00:01:05.780
that's the zombie noise for all of the zombie shows and, uh,

22
00:01:05.810 --> 00:01:09.560
for walking dead, you know, I, you not do it.

23
00:01:10.550 --> 00:01:14.870
I walk outside on the boardwalk in Atlantic city and I see this homeless guy and

24
00:01:14.871 --> 00:01:18.950
for real, he's going like that. And I was like, Oh,

25
00:01:18.951 --> 00:01:23.540
zombies in real life. Um, but yeah, dude,

26
00:01:23.541 --> 00:01:27.170
it's crazy. Uh, about the, about Atlantic city and how it's a thing,

27
00:01:27.860 --> 00:01:29.540
rooms are like $50 a night.

28
00:01:31.460 --> 00:01:32.293
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

29
00:01:33.380 --> 00:01:36.720
<v 0>So, um, yeah. And, uh, but it was cool to,</v>

30
00:01:36.721 --> 00:01:39.860
to be in Atlantic city for extended period of time, I guess. I mean, I was in,

31
00:01:39.861 --> 00:01:43.880
I've only played like the Brugada and Harris and I go the day of,

32
00:01:43.881 --> 00:01:47.240
and I leave the next day because why would I stay in Atlantic city about dude

33
00:01:47.241 --> 00:01:49.970
when you're in the Borgata? And when you're in the, um,

34
00:01:50.270 --> 00:01:54.110
like there's an old hotel called ocean, there's a few hotels. When you go in,

35
00:01:54.111 --> 00:01:57.920
you might as well be in Vegas, do it, except for the people look like.

36
00:01:58.970 --> 00:01:59.803
<v 1>Freeze.</v>

37
00:02:01.340 --> 00:02:04.310
<v 0>They're just not as good looking as the people in Vegas now,</v>

38
00:02:04.340 --> 00:02:07.070
Vegas has the troglodytes and the make no mistake.

39
00:02:07.940 --> 00:02:11.090
If they're slot machines around, there's troglodytes around. Now,

40
00:02:11.091 --> 00:02:15.160
if you were my opener, you'd say what's a troglodyte. Well,

41
00:02:15.180 --> 00:02:16.580
troglodyte is somebody is a troll.

42
00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:21.890
It's basically a troll that lives under a bridge or something like that. Anyway,

43
00:02:21.920 --> 00:02:25.340
it's a dumb word. You know what I mean? Troglodyte, like, just make it shorter,

44
00:02:25.370 --> 00:02:26.780
call it a truck or a troll,

45
00:02:27.890 --> 00:02:30.500
but they don't the English language likes to get jiggy with it.

46
00:02:30.501 --> 00:02:31.820
So then they're going to get treated with it, dude.

47
00:02:33.650 --> 00:02:36.410
I'm I'm wearing my future's so bright way too bright shirt,

48
00:02:36.411 --> 00:02:41.150
because my future's way too bright got me with the shades on over here.

49
00:02:41.330 --> 00:02:43.850
And you could see the back if you were behind me, but you can't right now.

50
00:02:43.880 --> 00:02:47.750
It's all good. I'm not going to show it to you cause I'm, don't want to.

51
00:02:47.751 --> 00:02:50.600
And that's respect, dude. That's straight up respect. I mean,

52
00:02:50.601 --> 00:02:53.600
not doing what I wanted me doing exactly what I want to do for you guys.

53
00:02:53.660 --> 00:02:54.493
You're welcome.

54
00:02:58.370 --> 00:02:59.980
<v 1>Anyway, dude, I am back.</v>

55
00:03:00.040 --> 00:03:03.640
<v 0>And I was in every, uh, Friday. I went,</v>

56
00:03:03.700 --> 00:03:07.240
I went to New York city because it was a,

57
00:03:07.241 --> 00:03:10.300
because I didn't want to be in Atlantic city for like two days off because I

58
00:03:10.450 --> 00:03:13.120
would have, you know,

59
00:03:15.990 --> 00:03:18.990
it's crazy weird to be here, like on a, in a casino,

60
00:03:18.991 --> 00:03:22.350
but also near the beach S a Jersey

61
00:03:23.850 --> 00:03:28.590
and a seagulls. Even the seagulls are like, what the is going on around here?

62
00:03:29.580 --> 00:03:33.810
Why are there casinos, squawk? And so, uh,

63
00:03:35.070 --> 00:03:39.120
like you see them, if you look close to their face or like squawk,

64
00:03:40.590 --> 00:03:45.060
why are there troglodytes? Skok um,

65
00:03:45.810 --> 00:03:50.190
squawk. This was ours a little while ago. Squawk did squawk.

66
00:03:50.910 --> 00:03:55.350
Um, so I went to New York city. Yeah.

67
00:03:55.380 --> 00:03:59.100
And every time you go to New York, you see the most new year.

68
00:03:59.820 --> 00:04:02.820
It's all unreal. It's just unreal.

69
00:04:03.660 --> 00:04:08.400
I was in New York and I saw two dudes straight

70
00:04:08.401 --> 00:04:11.640
up fighting with each other, arguing,

71
00:04:11.641 --> 00:04:15.720
like not physically fighting, but they were like, it was like,

72
00:04:15.750 --> 00:04:19.470
the next step was the guy.

73
00:04:19.530 --> 00:04:22.170
One of the guys has to like duck. Cause the other guy is going to punch.

74
00:04:22.800 --> 00:04:24.210
And they were arguing with,

75
00:04:24.330 --> 00:04:28.860
to each other about arguing with each other about, uh,

76
00:04:30.120 --> 00:04:33.480
whose team was better Jersey, Sidney Ark.

77
00:04:34.110 --> 00:04:37.830
They were talking about the giants and the jets. It was like, you're, he's like,

78
00:04:38.160 --> 00:04:42.060
your team. You ain't. Your teammate. But like for real angry.

79
00:04:43.440 --> 00:04:47.100
Um, and they were like, you piece of. You ain't. He was like, you ain't.

80
00:04:47.310 --> 00:04:49.530
Your teammates. And you ain't. He was like, he was like,

81
00:04:49.650 --> 00:04:52.290
and the other guy was like, I'm gangster. And he was like, Oh,

82
00:04:52.291 --> 00:04:56.370
you ain't gangster. You ain't without your boys. Like, that's what was going on.

83
00:04:56.550 --> 00:04:59.370
And they kept on like walking away, but then walking close to each other.

84
00:04:59.640 --> 00:05:03.960
Now this was the most New York. Not yet, but this was the most New York.

85
00:05:04.470 --> 00:05:08.190
They were doing that to each other. And I, you not, dude.

86
00:05:08.730 --> 00:05:10.860
They were actually for real angry with each other,

87
00:05:10.980 --> 00:05:14.730
but they were also dapping each other. And high-fiving each other.

88
00:05:16.740 --> 00:05:21.480
Your friends are not, I am not boosting you dude.

89
00:05:21.810 --> 00:05:24.960
They were like, you, you ain't without your boys, you ain't gangster.

90
00:05:25.410 --> 00:05:29.910
I am gay some other, I'll kill you. And they were like, Hey, your.

91
00:05:30.900 --> 00:05:33.720
But I respect that. But you. But they literally said they respect that,

92
00:05:34.050 --> 00:05:36.690
but we're doing that. And they were yelling at the top of their lens lungs.

93
00:05:36.691 --> 00:05:39.450
Everybody was watching and they were going to shoot each other,

94
00:05:40.140 --> 00:05:41.220
but they were dabbing.

95
00:05:45.600 --> 00:05:47.100
Why were they doing it? Don't know.

96
00:05:48.210 --> 00:05:51.420
But that's the New York way in a New York minute.

97
00:05:53.520 --> 00:05:58.340
Ooh, everything can change in the New York minute. Uh,

98
00:05:58.370 --> 00:06:02.120
my mom, when I was younger would do, would say New York minute. And,

99
00:06:02.270 --> 00:06:04.520
but she would do it, not the singing way. She would be like, Hey,

100
00:06:04.521 --> 00:06:06.530
in a New York minute, in a New York minute.

101
00:06:06.830 --> 00:06:10.340
And it would always make me mad because the New York minute is 60 seconds.

102
00:06:10.341 --> 00:06:11.990
And that's how much regular men it is.

103
00:06:12.830 --> 00:06:15.770
But she thought she was crafty and cool and poetic. Now that's what she does.

104
00:06:15.860 --> 00:06:19.880
And it's all good. My babies moms are dramatic. If your mom made dramatic,

105
00:06:19.910 --> 00:06:21.590
guess what? She's your dad.

106
00:06:22.880 --> 00:06:26.000
Because moms are dramatic as women get older.

107
00:06:26.030 --> 00:06:29.570
And especially if they pop kids out, when they become a mom, they get dramatic.

108
00:06:29.571 --> 00:06:32.930
When my mom saw Columbine, she dropped. When she saw Columbine on, on the news,

109
00:06:32.931 --> 00:06:36.920
she dropped her notebook, who the drops stuff in real life. For real who,

110
00:06:36.980 --> 00:06:40.730
who for real goes, uh, and then drop something,

111
00:06:41.810 --> 00:06:45.740
pull your Kaiser San Jose at the end, she dropped her notebook on my foot.

112
00:06:45.770 --> 00:06:48.680
I go out mom, what the? And she says, Oh, shut the up.

113
00:06:55.810 --> 00:06:56.643
<v 1>Dude.</v>

114
00:06:58.940 --> 00:07:03.490
<v 0>This, she said, shut the up. You know, a mom. Oh, shut the up. [inaudible]</v>

115
00:07:06.370 --> 00:07:08.800
um, so yeah, so in a New York minutes,

116
00:07:08.890 --> 00:07:11.260
you dropped the notebook on my foot and it's all good.

117
00:07:11.261 --> 00:07:14.560
Now can I get the cowlick down on the back of my head now? And it's all good.

118
00:07:14.561 --> 00:07:17.470
Does it me off? Yeah, this is going to change it. No, it doesn't matter,

119
00:07:17.800 --> 00:07:22.630
but I need to look good. No, it doesn't matter. But, um,

120
00:07:22.660 --> 00:07:25.720
so anyway, I did that. I, she did,

121
00:07:25.730 --> 00:07:27.400
she dropped the notebook and that was when I real,

122
00:07:27.401 --> 00:07:29.320
that was when I came up with the thing where I was like, wow, dude,

123
00:07:29.321 --> 00:07:32.530
moms are dramatic, but dads aren't, you know,

124
00:07:34.660 --> 00:07:39.610
dads aren't, that's just laugh it off.

125
00:07:39.611 --> 00:07:40.444
And.

126
00:07:41.530 --> 00:07:42.363
<v 1>I don't know, man.</v>

127
00:07:42.400 --> 00:07:45.130
<v 0>They get maybe my, my, my dad's sentimentalist too, though.</v>

128
00:07:45.310 --> 00:07:49.030
My dad will look at it. Like it's just,

129
00:07:49.060 --> 00:07:50.980
and that's probably why I'm sentimental, man.

130
00:07:51.010 --> 00:07:55.540
Like when I see like involving like a D a kid and an a and a

131
00:07:55.541 --> 00:07:59.500
dad, if it's, I don't give a. If it's a, it could be a Trivago commercial.

132
00:07:59.501 --> 00:08:01.870
I'm crying immediately. If he goes, like,

133
00:08:01.871 --> 00:08:04.900
I go to Trivago to get all my hotel deals because I,

134
00:08:05.350 --> 00:08:08.290
because when I'm staying with my son, we need and I'm just it.

135
00:08:09.400 --> 00:08:14.020
That guy from Travago the commercial that guy's so handsome, you know,

136
00:08:14.050 --> 00:08:16.810
for sure he's got no kids because he just stays

137
00:08:19.030 --> 00:08:22.000
the Trivago guys. The. When I went out, when I get older,

138
00:08:22.001 --> 00:08:25.600
I want to be the Trivago guy. No, I don't want to actually work for Trivago,

139
00:08:25.601 --> 00:08:29.920
but I want to be that like, that guy is so, so handsome. It's hilarious.

140
00:08:30.220 --> 00:08:33.190
If you have all even gray hair, you're the. Unless it's white,

141
00:08:33.220 --> 00:08:37.900
then you don't look good. And that's the rules and I don't make the rules, dude.

142
00:08:38.890 --> 00:08:42.130
<v 1>The rules are the rules and I figured them out.</v>

143
00:08:46.420 --> 00:08:50.980
<v 0>Um, anyway, um, but that's yeah,</v>

144
00:08:50.981 --> 00:08:53.080
so I saw that New York thing and it was insane.
