1
00:00:01.260 --> 00:00:05.850
<v 0>Um, so I went to, uh, realia. Now here's the deal, my opener.</v>

2
00:00:06.720 --> 00:00:10.500
Who's going to remain nameless now because he doesn't deserve the credit at this

3
00:00:10.501 --> 00:00:14.250
point. Okay. Because let me show you how I am.

4
00:00:14.640 --> 00:00:17.850
If you could imagine how I am. So he was,

5
00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:22.860
I said, Hey, we've got a, we've got two gigs in a really Canada.

6
00:00:24.160 --> 00:00:26.940
He says, where's that? I say two hours from Toronto. And he goes, cool.

7
00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:28.770
I love Toronto. And I think, well.

8
00:00:29.060 --> 00:00:30.140
<v 1>It's not Toronto.</v>

9
00:00:32.150 --> 00:00:34.820
<v 0>So we, so he says, Hey, by the way,</v>

10
00:00:35.090 --> 00:00:38.330
I have a gig two days before the Toronto gig.

11
00:00:40.850 --> 00:00:41.300
Um,

12
00:00:41.300 --> 00:00:46.100
and it's in Chicago now I bring an opener because a lot of the

13
00:00:46.101 --> 00:00:50.360
time, one of the main reasons I bring an opener is because I like to travel with

14
00:00:50.361 --> 00:00:52.880
somebody. I don't like to be up. I'm a lonely boy, dude,

15
00:00:53.030 --> 00:00:54.350
if I take flights across the country,

16
00:00:54.351 --> 00:00:57.740
if I take international intern Intercontinental or just continental flights,

17
00:00:57.770 --> 00:01:00.260
I'm a lonely boy. If I'm alone, you know, do you understand?

18
00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:06.050
I buy cashews at the, uh, Hudson news and I'm eating them. Like I want them,

19
00:01:06.051 --> 00:01:10.910
but I don't want them. I get salted almonds. Right. But I'm a lonely boy.

20
00:01:11.540 --> 00:01:12.141
I hate them. Like,

21
00:01:12.141 --> 00:01:16.040
I'm Oliver twist asking my police have more or whatever the that was.

22
00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:19.490
I'm a lonely boy. I'm just eating because I'm a lonely boy.

23
00:01:20.390 --> 00:01:24.080
But if I have Mike, whoops, if I have my opener

24
00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:26.533
with me,

25
00:01:26.540 --> 00:01:30.320
I don't need to get those things because I'm not feeling insecure and I'm not a

26
00:01:30.321 --> 00:01:33.500
lonely boy. Okay. So he says, look,

27
00:01:33.530 --> 00:01:38.480
I know you like to bring me because you like to pay me and you

28
00:01:38.481 --> 00:01:41.630
like to, and you like to pay me for free for you not being a lonely boy.

29
00:01:42.860 --> 00:01:46.340
And I say, okay. Yeah, what's common. And he says, well,

30
00:01:46.580 --> 00:01:49.190
it just so turns out that I have a gig two days before in Chicago,

31
00:01:49.191 --> 00:01:51.680
do you think that I could fly to Chicago?

32
00:01:51.860 --> 00:01:55.280
And then the next day I could fly to Toronto since it's so close and meet you in

33
00:01:55.281 --> 00:01:57.650
Toronto. And I say, you know what? Sure. Yeah,

34
00:01:57.651 --> 00:01:59.540
of course I'll take the lonely boy flight.

35
00:02:02.930 --> 00:02:04.850
<v 1>So I take the lonely boy flight. Okay.</v>

36
00:02:05.780 --> 00:02:09.850
<v 0>And he says the day before,</v>

37
00:02:10.070 --> 00:02:14.540
but the day before the lonely boy flight, right. He says, Hey, don't be mad.

38
00:02:14.750 --> 00:02:15.860
And I go like this.

39
00:02:16.310 --> 00:02:18.200
<v 1>Too late. Okay.</v>

40
00:02:19.160 --> 00:02:22.970
<v 0>Because if you're saying, Hey, don't be mad. I like being mad too much.</v>

41
00:02:23.510 --> 00:02:27.050
And I'm already mad. Um, so,

42
00:02:27.560 --> 00:02:29.270
so he says,

43
00:02:30.170 --> 00:02:33.620
and if you know anything about my opener already, you know,

44
00:02:33.621 --> 00:02:38.000
he's a Dingus piece of. All right. So, and you know,

45
00:02:38.001 --> 00:02:42.770
he's not, it, it, he's pretty dumb. Like he's in his life.

46
00:02:42.771 --> 00:02:44.810
He's gone like this before, you know?

47
00:02:45.590 --> 00:02:50.570
And so he says to me, I figured it out already,

48
00:02:50.600 --> 00:02:55.280
dude, that's the best. Yay dude.

49
00:02:55.281 --> 00:02:59.060
It's so awesome that he goes like this don't be mad. I figured it out.

50
00:03:04.020 --> 00:03:06.900
Hey, don't be mad. I figured it out already.

51
00:03:07.020 --> 00:03:10.770
Now there's a certain level of madness I get when that happens.

52
00:03:10.920 --> 00:03:13.830
I want you to know about the levels of Matt. First of all, there's annoyed.

53
00:03:13.860 --> 00:03:16.800
That's not that bad. It's like in a fun territory. You're like, God it.

54
00:03:16.801 --> 00:03:18.840
They forgot to catch up. Whatever the.

55
00:03:19.290 --> 00:03:23.670
Then there's a level of mad where you go like this. Oh, bro. I'm mad.

56
00:03:23.850 --> 00:03:27.150
You tell me what the going on. I'm furious. And I'm yelling.

57
00:03:27.240 --> 00:03:30.960
And then there's another level of mad on top of that,

58
00:03:31.410 --> 00:03:36.120
where you go quiet, where you just sit back and you relax.

59
00:03:36.870 --> 00:03:40.050
It's like when the it's like in the, in the, when I was watching the show,

60
00:03:40.320 --> 00:03:43.800
the movie there's one movie where it was like a world ending movie,

61
00:03:43.920 --> 00:03:45.690
whatever the by Roland Emmerich,

62
00:03:46.590 --> 00:03:50.340
something called like deep horizon or impact of the tomorrow,

63
00:03:50.341 --> 00:03:53.430
whatever the it was, where the big wave was coming.

64
00:03:53.431 --> 00:03:54.810
And the dad and his daughter is like,

65
00:03:54.811 --> 00:03:56.850
here at comes and they just hug each other. They're coming.

66
00:03:57.060 --> 00:04:01.050
That's how calm I am. I'm watching this big wave come crash.

67
00:04:01.051 --> 00:04:05.070
And I know everybody's dying. Okay. I'm in a movie.

68
00:04:05.071 --> 00:04:09.420
I'm in a role in Emmerich movie right now when Mike says, Hey, don't be mad.

69
00:04:09.480 --> 00:04:10.590
I figured it out.

70
00:04:10.890 --> 00:04:15.090
I grabbed my daughter and I wait for that big wave because what the am I going

71
00:04:15.091 --> 00:04:15.924
to do, dude?

72
00:04:20.460 --> 00:04:23.310
<v 1>So, so he says,</v>

73
00:04:26.010 --> 00:04:28.350
no. So I say yes.

74
00:04:28.380 --> 00:04:30.870
<v 0>So I, I, this is what happened. He said, don't be mad. I figured it out.</v>

75
00:04:30.900 --> 00:04:35.730
And I say, you forgot your passport. And he says, okay. Yeah.

76
00:04:38.190 --> 00:04:39.023
<v 1>I'm waiting for that. Wave.</v>

77
00:04:40.710 --> 00:04:43.530
<v 0>The waves are getting a little bit bigger. Right? It was far away. I said,</v>

78
00:04:43.531 --> 00:04:47.730
you forgot your passport. And the wave that wave got a little bit bigger.

79
00:04:48.330 --> 00:04:49.380
It went from there.

80
00:04:50.310 --> 00:04:51.143
<v 1>To there.</v>

81
00:04:52.110 --> 00:04:56.610
<v 0>Here it comes. It's getting louder. And he says, so you know how,</v>

82
00:04:56.611 --> 00:05:00.330
I always bring my passport card with me.

83
00:05:01.440 --> 00:05:05.640
And if you're an avid listener of congratulations podcast, you know,

84
00:05:06.060 --> 00:05:06.893
that might.

85
00:05:07.890 --> 00:05:10.260
<v 1>Brought that once.</v>

86
00:05:11.130 --> 00:05:12.810
<v 0>Try and get over the border. I, something happened.</v>

87
00:05:12.811 --> 00:05:13.830
I don't remember what the happened.

88
00:05:13.831 --> 00:05:17.400
You remember the episode something happened where he had the passport.

89
00:05:17.401 --> 00:05:19.320
And we were like, Oh, it doesn't work for the flight,

90
00:05:19.321 --> 00:05:23.130
but we're driving over anyway. So it's okay. I was like, it better work.

91
00:05:23.190 --> 00:05:26.640
And it did work. And he was like, yeah. And I was like, all right, you won.

92
00:05:26.660 --> 00:05:30.900
Luckily dude, you had 19 and you hit and you got a two,

93
00:05:31.050 --> 00:05:33.090
but you're lucky you should have kept the 19.

94
00:05:33.820 --> 00:05:36.240
I don't like when works out for dummies, you understand,

95
00:05:36.330 --> 00:05:40.890
you need to understand that you're a dumb and have the happen. And that's it,

96
00:05:40.920 --> 00:05:45.540
dude, you deal with it. And that's how you learn. And if you're 35,

97
00:05:45.780 --> 00:05:47.780
like he is sub Bay.

98
00:05:48.930 --> 00:05:49.763
<v 1>So.</v>

99
00:05:51.720 --> 00:05:55.680
<v 0>He says, I have that. Cause I always have it because my mom made me get it.</v>

100
00:05:56.290 --> 00:05:58.560
Ha ah.

101
00:05:59.610 --> 00:06:01.220
<v 1>Ah, Oh.</v>

102
00:06:01.720 --> 00:06:05.230
<v 0>Dude, his Dick is probably four and a half inches. And when it gets hard,</v>

103
00:06:05.260 --> 00:06:09.070
it's probably four inches. Do you understand his Dick?

104
00:06:09.400 --> 00:06:13.960
doesn't even get bigger. It congeals. It like gets smaller but harder.

105
00:06:15.790 --> 00:06:19.120
So anyway, so he says some.

106
00:06:19.630 --> 00:06:21.670
<v 1>Luckily my mom made me get my PA Hey dude.</v>

107
00:06:22.870 --> 00:06:27.760
<v 0>Okay. So he goes like this. Um, so here's what I'm going to do.</v>

108
00:06:27.970 --> 00:06:30.760
And that wave got little bit bigger.

109
00:06:32.200 --> 00:06:35.800
<v 1>The wave, the wave, wait a second. I'm squint my eyes.</v>

110
00:06:36.160 --> 00:06:39.310
<v 0>Did it double in size. Did it double in size?</v>

111
00:06:40.120 --> 00:06:43.960
So I grabbed my daughter a little harder and I pull her in

112
00:06:45.160 --> 00:06:48.460
because maybe this is the big one. And he says,

113
00:06:49.180 --> 00:06:54.070
I'm going to take a flight from Chicago

114
00:06:55.150 --> 00:06:58.660
to Buffalo, New York, wait a second.

115
00:06:59.740 --> 00:07:02.320
Did that wave get a little bit bigger?

116
00:07:04.420 --> 00:07:09.400
My daughter puts her chin into daddy's shoulder. Okay.

117
00:07:10.270 --> 00:07:14.560
So I say, and he says,

118
00:07:15.700 --> 00:07:19.720
I'm going to have, I'm going to fly into Buffalo really early.

119
00:07:20.470 --> 00:07:21.820
And then I'm going to have.

120
00:07:24.820 --> 00:07:26.740
<v 1>Some one.</v>

121
00:07:30.700 --> 00:07:34.780
<v 0>Hey dude, let me tell you something. Let's let's, let's, let's cut back.</v>

122
00:07:34.990 --> 00:07:36.880
It's like one of those movies that begins and when it's like,

123
00:07:37.030 --> 00:07:40.600
and the guy's like summed like that movie with Chris burns,

124
00:07:41.440 --> 00:07:44.230
what's that guy's name is Chris ed burns. And he,

125
00:07:44.231 --> 00:07:47.080
and it starts in he and he's dead. And he says, so I'm dead. Right?

126
00:07:47.110 --> 00:07:49.870
And then it goes and it flashes back and you're like, all right,

127
00:07:49.930 --> 00:07:52.600
I've got to find out how this guy died or American beauty when he's like,

128
00:07:52.601 --> 00:07:54.550
this is the last day of my life. You know, I gotta,

129
00:07:54.610 --> 00:07:56.620
we gotta find out what the happens. He's dead by the end of this.

130
00:07:56.890 --> 00:08:00.190
That's what happens. He says, so, so let's cut back all the way back. Hey,

131
00:08:00.280 --> 00:08:04.900
when you're saying don't be mad, I figured it out.

132
00:08:07.750 --> 00:08:09.100
<v 1>In no part of the rest.</v>

133
00:08:09.280 --> 00:08:14.170
<v 0>Just have that conversation. Do you say the word someone.</v>

134
00:08:15.340 --> 00:08:20.290
<v 1>You understand? Because if you figured it out, you know,</v>

135
00:08:22.030 --> 00:08:22.863
all right.

136
00:08:23.710 --> 00:08:28.180
So that wave what I'm noticing.

137
00:08:28.240 --> 00:08:32.650
It's getting real wide at the top, which means it's curling over.

138
00:08:32.770 --> 00:08:34.360
It's not going to subside.

139
00:08:36.040 --> 00:08:40.720
<v 0>So I say, yeah, he says, someone's going to pick,</v>

140
00:08:41.020 --> 00:08:45.610
someone's gonna pick me up in Buffalo and bring me to the

141
00:08:45.611 --> 00:08:50.200
Toronto airport while I use my passport card to get over the

142
00:08:51.520 --> 00:08:52.353
border.

143
00:08:52.570 --> 00:08:57.090
And I'll meet you when you land and can tell he's nervous.

144
00:08:57.360 --> 00:09:01.650
But what I can tell even more is that wave

145
00:09:02.520 --> 00:09:07.110
is gonna kill us. My daughter's crying at this point.

146
00:09:08.190 --> 00:09:11.940
Okay. So I go like this. Okay.

147
00:09:13.470 --> 00:09:17.280
And I hang up, cause your boy means business.

148
00:09:18.420 --> 00:09:22.260
I don't hang up lately. I hang up heavily.

149
00:09:24.150 --> 00:09:25.020
So say, okay,

150
00:09:27.030 --> 00:09:30.750
the day comes where he hits me up. By the way, how far is it from Buffalo?

151
00:09:30.780 --> 00:09:34.140
Two hours and five minutes. Wow. It's a hundred miles.

152
00:09:34.740 --> 00:09:39.540
This moron. You know? So the day comes, hi, yada,

153
00:09:39.541 --> 00:09:42.870
yada, I'm taking this and that a train. He took a train. He took every window.

154
00:09:42.960 --> 00:09:46.470
He took a train, a plane, a car. This guy,

155
00:09:47.490 --> 00:09:51.000
I expected him a half, expected him to show up with a or, and shorts on.

156
00:09:51.930 --> 00:09:55.830
And um, I get to the thing, my, my flight's delayed.

157
00:09:55.831 --> 00:09:59.640
I get in at 1:00 AM and he's sitting there and he's like, bro, I'm so tired.

158
00:09:59.641 --> 00:10:01.560
And I look at him and I go good.

159
00:10:02.040 --> 00:10:05.730
And I realized that wave and my daughter,

160
00:10:06.090 --> 00:10:10.950
it didn't exist because it was all a movie. It was directed by Roland Emmerich.

161
00:10:11.370 --> 00:10:15.540
It wasn't real life. He made it happen. But he learned.

162
00:10:16.290 --> 00:10:20.130
And the thing about that is he didn't learn. He'll do it again.

163
00:10:20.940 --> 00:10:25.890
But in that brief moment of time, he learned, and I,

164
00:10:26.310 --> 00:10:29.040
uh, I didn't even really get that because there was no reason to,

165
00:10:29.190 --> 00:10:31.890
I was either going to have an opener. I said, Hey man, you tell Andrew,

166
00:10:31.891 --> 00:10:35.940
my agent, my high powered agent. I was like, you tell Andrew to,

167
00:10:36.390 --> 00:10:40.650
make sure to get another opener on deck because bro, I'm not doing it alone.

168
00:10:40.651 --> 00:10:43.560
And he was like, no, don't worry about it. And I was like, Oh, I said,

169
00:10:43.561 --> 00:10:45.690
you know how Madam would be if there's an opener. Right. And he said, yup.

170
00:10:46.290 --> 00:10:48.570
Anyway, wow, dude,
