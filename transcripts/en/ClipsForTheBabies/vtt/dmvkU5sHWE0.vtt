1
00:00:03.150 --> 00:00:07.500
<v 0>It's like that with the Michael Shay, Michael Che with the SNL,</v>

2
00:00:07.501 --> 00:00:11.310
when they tried to, when he made the joke about Kanye west and it was all okay.

3
00:00:11.610 --> 00:00:14.070
Everything was okay until he mentioned Caitlyn Jenner.

4
00:00:14.071 --> 00:00:15.480
And then everyone went nuts about it.

5
00:00:16.470 --> 00:00:17.940
<v 1>Oh dude.</v>

6
00:00:17.940 --> 00:00:21.810
<v 0>It's legitimately a good joke. When Michael Che was like, uh,</v>

7
00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:23.610
he was saying like, uh,

8
00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:29.070
Kanye west is a white lady now because he's like into whatever

9
00:00:29.071 --> 00:00:29.431
he was saying.

10
00:00:29.431 --> 00:00:34.350
He was into fashion voting for Trump and he's like complaints about

11
00:00:34.351 --> 00:00:36.540
whatever the the joke was. And he was like,

12
00:00:36.541 --> 00:00:40.500
he turned into an old white lady and then it sort of picture of Caitlyn Jenner.

13
00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:45.300
And it was like, by the way, I remember another, uh, guy who moved to,

14
00:00:45.810 --> 00:00:49.380
um, Calabasas. And that was where the joke stopped. And it was like, okay,

15
00:00:49.381 --> 00:00:53.850
Bruce Jenner turned into a old, old white lady as well. And that's a funny joke,

16
00:00:53.910 --> 00:00:57.960
whatever, you know, whatever, not you think it's funny, it's a joke.

17
00:00:58.380 --> 00:01:02.910
And there was this article dude that came out on,

18
00:01:03.270 --> 00:01:07.410
was it indie wire? I don't want to get this wrong actually. What was it?

19
00:01:07.411 --> 00:01:10.750
It was on, uh,

20
00:01:11.170 --> 00:01:16.150
indie wa in the wire. Here it is. Yeah.

21
00:01:16.930 --> 00:01:21.610
IndyWire Saturday night live Michael Che's Caitlin Jenner joke.

22
00:01:21.611 --> 00:01:23.830
Wasn't funny. It was hate speech.

23
00:01:28.900 --> 00:01:33.410
<v 2>Uh, dude. Hey, are you all right? All right,</v>

24
00:01:34.930 --> 00:01:36.880
dude. Hate speech.

25
00:01:37.420 --> 00:01:40.990
Imagine SNL doing hate speech.

26
00:01:42.550 --> 00:01:46.440
You want to be a victim or what? Some people, they just want to be victims.

27
00:01:46.470 --> 00:01:47.400
I swear to God.

28
00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:52.770
<v 0>Look at this over the week. This was so funny over the weekend,</v>

29
00:01:53.010 --> 00:01:56.250
starting at life head writer, Michael Che told a joke at the, by the way,

30
00:01:56.370 --> 00:02:00.570
Michael Chase hilarious fan of Michael Che. Nice guy loved the dude,

31
00:02:01.950 --> 00:02:04.140
told the joke at the expense of Caitlyn Jenner, uh,

32
00:02:04.141 --> 00:02:07.890
that the joke totally bombed did not seem to bother headstrong comedian who

33
00:02:07.891 --> 00:02:10.650
giggled along with cohost chuckle. And just by the way, uh,

34
00:02:10.710 --> 00:02:15.030
there's another guy who's awesome. Colin Joe's is such a nice guy and hilarious.

35
00:02:15.840 --> 00:02:19.260
Um, didn't really bomb the joke didn't bomb. Also.

36
00:02:19.320 --> 00:02:20.880
<v 2>Even if it did, who cares?</v>

37
00:02:21.390 --> 00:02:22.830
<v 0>This is not the first time she has come under the scrutiny,</v>

38
00:02:22.950 --> 00:02:25.770
whatever that's because he's a talented community and any talented comedian

39
00:02:25.771 --> 00:02:28.260
comes under scrutiny. Um,

40
00:02:31.690 --> 00:02:32.523
cha uh,

41
00:02:34.420 --> 00:02:37.540
straight male comedians using transgender people as a punchline bag for the

42
00:02:37.541 --> 00:02:42.070
unfunny jokes. Chase so-called joke. I love this dude.

43
00:02:42.100 --> 00:02:44.350
The writer calls it a so-called joke.

44
00:02:44.950 --> 00:02:47.980
What do you know about jokes?

45
00:02:48.340 --> 00:02:49.930
<v 2>Who knows more about jokes?</v>

46
00:02:50.080 --> 00:02:53.880
You are Michael Che who knows more about Joe's.

47
00:02:53.881 --> 00:02:56.040
You are the head writer SNL.

48
00:02:59.060 --> 00:03:02.150
<v 0>He said the singer was turning into an old white lady. He elaborated, I mean,</v>

49
00:03:02.151 --> 00:03:03.800
he used to be one of the coolest black dudes on board.

50
00:03:03.880 --> 00:03:05.810
And now he's showing up at events and sweat pants, orthopedic sneakers,

51
00:03:05.811 --> 00:03:09.050
and listening to Kenny J that was the joke is way funnier than what I said and

52
00:03:09.051 --> 00:03:10.760
trying to get black people to light from funny.

53
00:03:11.990 --> 00:03:16.430
How long before this guy named chase is named Kathy funny, taking on a joke.

54
00:03:16.431 --> 00:03:19.370
The joke is fine. Even mildly funny. If Jay had stopped,

55
00:03:19.371 --> 00:03:22.910
there would have been a perfect acceptable Quip that didn't necessarily even

56
00:03:22.911 --> 00:03:25.430
reference trans people much less in a disrespectful way,

57
00:03:25.431 --> 00:03:27.710
but she had to go and bring Caitlyn Jenner into it.

58
00:03:28.310 --> 00:03:30.890
Now you think that I'm crazy. But about five years ago,

59
00:03:30.891 --> 00:03:34.250
there was a fellow named Bruce Jenner and he moved to Calabasas. There you go.

60
00:03:34.550 --> 00:03:36.380
That was the thing in one short sentence,

61
00:03:36.650 --> 00:03:39.950
Che managed Shay manages to use the word fella,

62
00:03:40.130 --> 00:03:43.820
the incorrect pronoun and Jenner's previous name. Okay.

63
00:03:43.821 --> 00:03:48.620
But he was a guy, right? He misgenders her dead names,

64
00:03:48.621 --> 00:03:53.240
her and actively calls her a word that is safe to assume she would never use to

65
00:03:53.241 --> 00:03:56.810
describe herself. K as a refresher.

66
00:03:56.930 --> 00:04:01.040
Sokak the writer as a refresher using a trans person's birth name is referred to

67
00:04:01.041 --> 00:04:03.740
as dead naming and is considered.

68
00:04:04.910 --> 00:04:06.140
<v 1>An act.</v>

69
00:04:06.710 --> 00:04:08.900
<v 0>Of violence.</v>

70
00:04:13.490 --> 00:04:18.090
Okay, dude, it's it's okay.

71
00:04:18.150 --> 00:04:20.010
You know, you're going to be like

72
00:04:22.890 --> 00:04:25.650
you're you're, that's not an act of violence. All right.

73
00:04:25.740 --> 00:04:29.580
That's that's just somebody saying some as a joke on Sarah, not life.

74
00:04:30.390 --> 00:04:32.220
That's not an act of violence.

75
00:04:34.920 --> 00:04:36.810
And as a matter of fact is even

76
00:04:39.150 --> 00:04:41.820
what's an act of violence is, is a threat, an act of violence.

77
00:04:42.120 --> 00:04:46.230
Is somebody saying like, Hey, I'm going to you up. Is that an act of violence

78
00:04:47.790 --> 00:04:50.820
or is an act of violence? Like striking someone? I don't know.

79
00:04:50.850 --> 00:04:51.683
What do you think?

80
00:04:52.740 --> 00:04:54.750
<v 2>Even saying saying.</v>

81
00:04:54.750 --> 00:04:58.890
<v 0>Something is not an act of violence. I mean,</v>

82
00:04:58.891 --> 00:05:00.930
it can incite an act of violence. Maybe

83
00:05:03.680 --> 00:05:05.660
I don't see how it is. Maybe I'm wrong.

84
00:05:05.750 --> 00:05:09.260
I'm a idiot when it comes to this and definitely talking out of my,

85
00:05:10.070 --> 00:05:13.370
but holy. That made me laugh. When I read that part.

86
00:05:14.480 --> 00:05:18.500
<v 2>Like, if you want to be included, if you want to be,</v>

87
00:05:19.640 --> 00:05:24.350
if inclusion is real and you want to be accepted, then guess what, dude,

88
00:05:24.470 --> 00:05:26.420
you get jokes, come in your way.

89
00:05:27.590 --> 00:05:31.610
If you want to be included here, come the jokes.

90
00:05:33.870 --> 00:05:36.270
Dude, make fun of me all day long.

91
00:05:41.670 --> 00:05:45.270
A lot of these people, and this is not, this is,

92
00:05:45.300 --> 00:05:50.040
this is the victims thing has gone out of control. Dude.

93
00:05:50.790 --> 00:05:54.030
There are real victims out there that have been through real.

94
00:06:01.040 --> 00:06:04.560
It's like, don't take, don't take that from them, man.

95
00:06:09.340 --> 00:06:13.710
<v 0>Um, it sucks, dude. Also that.</v>

96
00:06:14.220 --> 00:06:15.510
<v 2>These articles,</v>

97
00:06:15.900 --> 00:06:20.010
no joke are what going to is these articles.

<v 0>Are it's going to get Trump elected again.</v>

99
00:06:22.920 --> 00:06:25.530
That's what's going to get Trump elected again, a hundred percent.

100
00:06:25.800 --> 00:06:27.430
The two things that Trump we're going to get,

101
00:06:27.560 --> 00:06:30.510
there's going to get Trump elected again, and he's going to get elected again.

102
00:06:31.440 --> 00:06:33.510
These are the two things that are going to get them elected again,

103
00:06:34.080 --> 00:06:36.780
articles like that, tweets and like that.

104
00:06:37.470 --> 00:06:39.330
And also the.

105
00:06:39.810 --> 00:06:42.540
<v 2>Horrible democratic choices.</v>
