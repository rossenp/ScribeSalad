00:00:02.400 --> 00:00:02.880
<v 0>Now.</v>

2
00:00:02.880 --> 00:00:07.650
<v 1>Is there a place called the sugar factory? That's in the Hardrock hotel? Yes.</v>

3
00:00:07.680 --> 00:00:11.610
Did I go? Yes. Did I get ice cream? Yes. Was it good? Yes.

4
00:00:11.640 --> 00:00:15.510
Then that I get ice cream at another place because I would try and test out all

5
00:00:15.511 --> 00:00:18.900
the different ice creams in Atlantic city. Yes. Was it as good? No,

6
00:00:18.901 --> 00:00:21.600
it was a closer. Yes. So did I go again? Yes.

7
00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:25.350
Should I have gone to the sugar factory? Because it had better asked me. Yes.

8
00:00:25.530 --> 00:00:27.330
Did I not know because of laziness? Yes.

9
00:00:31.070 --> 00:00:31.903
<v 0>There's nothing more.</v>

10
00:00:32.480 --> 00:00:36.920
<v 1>Piggy than going and getting the worst ice cream because it's closer.</v>

11
00:00:38.990 --> 00:00:39.530
<v 0>Go.</v>

12
00:00:39.530 --> 00:00:41.630
<v 1>Take a few extra steps. You knew.</v>

13
00:00:41.750 --> 00:00:44.630
<v 0>I'm rod, but I wouldn't.</v>

14
00:00:47.900 --> 00:00:48.733
Um.

15
00:00:49.400 --> 00:00:50.360
<v 1>So I went to go get the,</v>

16
00:00:50.660 --> 00:00:53.060
I went to the sugar factory and that ice cream was banging. Dude,

17
00:00:53.061 --> 00:00:55.160
if you go to the hard rock in Atlantic city, that's just banging.

18
00:00:55.490 --> 00:00:59.600
But if you go to the, uh, if you go to the hardware, if you go to the, Oh,

19
00:00:59.601 --> 00:01:02.210
I got that. Don't get food there though. I got food there and it's,

20
00:01:02.930 --> 00:01:07.820
it's so gross. It's so gross. I mean, don't get, I got the salmon.

21
00:01:08.300 --> 00:01:11.720
Don't get the salmon at a place called the sugar factory.

22
00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:16.280
Literally someone was like, Oh. Which some guy came up to me. He said, Oh,

23
00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:19.370
what are you doing here? I was like, what do you mean? He was like,

24
00:01:19.670 --> 00:01:23.600
are you an actor? Some. I was like, well, yeah, I guess. Sure. Yeah. Yeah.

25
00:01:23.990 --> 00:01:27.020
And he was like, what's, y'all doing here. I was like, Oh, we're doing a movie.

26
00:01:27.050 --> 00:01:31.610
And he was like, Oh. I already ordered the, the ice cream. And the,

27
00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:33.890
the lady behind the counter goes like this, here you go.

28
00:01:33.891 --> 00:01:36.170
And gives me the ice cream. And I said, cool, what do I owe you? And she says,

29
00:01:36.171 --> 00:01:39.170
you're shooting a movie here. And I said, yeah. And she said, just take it.

30
00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:48.050
<v 0>I don't even deserve the parks.</v>

31
00:01:48.650 --> 00:01:49.730
You don't know me.

32
00:01:51.410 --> 00:01:55.760
<v 1>Took a regular dudes word for it. Just some guy with his chick.</v>

33
00:01:57.050 --> 00:01:59.840
What are you doing here? You shooting a movie. Yeah. Just take it

34
00:02:01.610 --> 00:02:02.990
sad in a way.

35
00:02:04.580 --> 00:02:08.030
<v 0>You know? Wow dude.</v>

36
00:02:10.670 --> 00:02:12.680
<v 1>Um, Atlantic city is hilarious.</v>

37
00:02:13.730 --> 00:02:16.880
Just straight up is zero. Good looking people.

38
00:02:21.320 --> 00:02:22.153
<v 0>Um.</v>

39
00:02:22.460 --> 00:02:25.640
<v 1>I dunno. So Jersey though, like crazy,</v>

40
00:02:25.641 --> 00:02:28.970
incredibly Jersey went to, uh,

41
00:02:30.140 --> 00:02:34.850
went to let me do these ads and then I'll do it. I went to, uh,

42
00:02:34.910 --> 00:02:38.990
New Jersey or I went to Atlantic city and it's so it's S the Jersey.

43
00:02:38.991 --> 00:02:41.240
We went to a place called white house subs. By the way,

44
00:02:41.241 --> 00:02:44.120
I went to white house subs and there's a few white house subs.

45
00:02:44.390 --> 00:02:48.920
And it was just silly. Like I mentioned it around a local,

46
00:02:49.220 --> 00:02:53.300
which was annoying because I was talking to Garrett, my buddy Dylan.

47
00:02:53.900 --> 00:02:55.970
And he, I was like, we got to go to the pistol by our subs.

48
00:02:55.971 --> 00:02:56.721
Apparently it's really good.

49
00:02:56.721 --> 00:02:59.590
My agent told me about it and the guy who overheard us as I, yeah.

50
00:02:59.710 --> 00:03:03.610
But you got to go to the original. Now we know if you know anything about me,

51
00:03:03.640 --> 00:03:05.740
my anger is a Ryzen.

52
00:03:06.910 --> 00:03:10.270
Cause it doesn't matter about the original dude. It doesn't matter. I said, Oh,

53
00:03:10.271 --> 00:03:14.050
why is it better food there? And he said, no, but the atmosphere and I go.

54
00:03:16.890 --> 00:03:17.723
<v 0>Hmm.</v>

55
00:03:17.820 --> 00:03:21.300
<v 1>And then Garrett, of course, because he's a real person is like, well, you know,</v>

56
00:03:21.301 --> 00:03:24.450
let's go to the original. It's like, all right, we'll go to the original.

57
00:03:24.451 --> 00:03:28.350
So we drove, he drove and the whole time he was like, I gotta get gas.

58
00:03:28.351 --> 00:03:31.380
And I was like, you're fine. It's like one fourth. And he was like, yeah,

59
00:03:31.460 --> 00:03:34.740
we're going to find a gas. I was like, you're fine, dude. We got there.

60
00:03:35.310 --> 00:03:38.340
As soon as we walked in, it was,

61
00:03:40.290 --> 00:03:43.830
Garrett says, man, there's a lot of Jersey faces in here. Huh. And there was,

62
00:03:44.220 --> 00:03:48.420
everybody was talking about Frank, do you know what I mean? But that's not what,

63
00:03:48.840 --> 00:03:49.673
that's not what Frank said.

64
00:03:51.940 --> 00:03:56.160
I heard that 14 times while I was eating a sup out. It's not what Frank said

65
00:03:58.530 --> 00:04:01.980
at us, not what Camon said, heard it 14 times.

66
00:04:02.850 --> 00:04:05.790
And, and um,

67
00:04:07.200 --> 00:04:10.800
I get there and the lady is like, you know what you want? And I was like,

68
00:04:11.430 --> 00:04:13.980
now you've got menus. And she was like, sure, she's put down menus.

69
00:04:13.981 --> 00:04:18.660
And then there's a half order and a full order out at white house subs.

70
00:04:19.200 --> 00:04:21.360
And I was like, I'm gonna get the Turkey. You know how I do it?

71
00:04:21.361 --> 00:04:23.220
I get the Turkey and the cheese of a medicine.

72
00:04:23.400 --> 00:04:27.600
Plus I get a Turkey cheese because I want to rock it. I don't get the,

73
00:04:28.230 --> 00:04:32.880
you know, other. I don't mix meats too much. An Italian sub is nice.

74
00:04:32.881 --> 00:04:37.710
Let's not around in Italian. Sub is nice as. But the Turkey and cheese,

75
00:04:39.630 --> 00:04:43.470
I mean, I would roll down a, uh, what do you call it? Ralphs.

76
00:04:43.530 --> 00:04:46.470
When I used to have a, uh, when I used to live in my apartment,

77
00:04:46.680 --> 00:04:47.670
I rolled down a Russ.

78
00:04:47.671 --> 00:04:50.820
I'd walked down there and just go get meat and cheese dude.

79
00:04:52.380 --> 00:04:55.500
And they'd be like, Hey, how's it going? Regular? And I'd say. Yeah,

80
00:04:55.530 --> 00:04:58.770
meat and cheese. And I'd roll back. And I'd surprise my ex-girlfriend.

81
00:04:58.980 --> 00:05:01.920
And I'd be like, I got meta cheese. Cause that's how we said it. Meta cheese.

82
00:05:02.070 --> 00:05:06.900
Cause we thought we were cute. We broke up with both.

83
00:05:06.960 --> 00:05:11.880
We both cried, but meat and cheese dude.

84
00:05:12.600 --> 00:05:17.460
So now I get made of cheese. Anyway.

85
00:05:17.640 --> 00:05:21.240
I mean in the about us section for white house subs,

86
00:05:21.660 --> 00:05:25.710
there's a photo of the two guys who found it.

87
00:05:25.950 --> 00:05:30.180
And the one of the guys is chomping on a

88
00:05:31.020 --> 00:05:34.050
Stokey eh, Jersey,

89
00:05:35.960 --> 00:05:37.370
or you want to take it.

90
00:05:38.250 --> 00:05:42.750
The white house shop was opened in October, 1946 by Anthony Brasil,

91
00:05:42.990 --> 00:05:46.320
along with his aunt Basilea and uncle Fritz

92
00:05:48.240 --> 00:05:51.420
[inaudible] Jersey, Fritz,

93
00:05:53.280 --> 00:05:57.060
you know, Fritz dude,

94
00:06:00.160 --> 00:06:04.870
Uncle Fritz SoCo, S a C C O Fritz.

95
00:06:04.871 --> 00:06:05.471
Isn't a name.

96
00:06:05.471 --> 00:06:10.150
Fritz is like something that you're on.

97
00:06:10.151 --> 00:06:12.610
If you're going through a breakup, dude,

98
00:06:12.611 --> 00:06:17.380
Fritz is a noise that a cable like a broken cable would make Fritz Fritz for

99
00:06:17.381 --> 00:06:22.150
threats. And that's your name? Dude? S Jersey. So,

100
00:06:22.540 --> 00:06:25.120
um, in 1946,

101
00:06:25.150 --> 00:06:28.330
our parents were committed to bringing you the best sandwich made with the

102
00:06:28.331 --> 00:06:31.660
choice, CEUs meat, with the choice, choice it's choices,

103
00:06:32.080 --> 00:06:35.920
choice it's Jesus Christ. Choicest meat.

104
00:06:37.150 --> 00:06:38.290
Anytime you say meats,

105
00:06:38.560 --> 00:06:43.510
that's so Jersey in Italian and we'll meet you one today. We,

106
00:06:43.750 --> 00:06:47.590
the children are committed to maintaining that same tradition of excellence

107
00:06:47.740 --> 00:06:51.610
created by our parents. Sincerely the Brasil and SoCo,

108
00:06:51.611 --> 00:06:53.710
currently families and the white house gang

109
00:06:56.620 --> 00:06:58.690
Bissell, along with aunt Basilea, ah,

110
00:06:59.440 --> 00:07:02.110
sick and fusing the seal.

111
00:07:02.260 --> 00:07:06.730
And Basilea most Italian lawyers of all time come on down to Brasil and Cecilia.

112
00:07:08.590 --> 00:07:12.820
Um, so we went there and I heard, that's not what Frank said so much.

113
00:07:13.360 --> 00:07:16.720
So there's the large portion and the half portion portion. And I said, yeah,

114
00:07:16.750 --> 00:07:19.780
let me get the Turkey to cheese. She's like, you want the peppers?

115
00:07:20.080 --> 00:07:23.770
And I was like, Jersey. Okay. And she was like, um,

116
00:07:25.000 --> 00:07:29.800
do you, uh, do you want the full or the the half? And I said full.

117
00:07:29.920 --> 00:07:33.910
And she, she looked at me and she was like, full is really big. And I said,

118
00:07:34.150 --> 00:07:36.850
how big? And she's a fullest like that big. She goes like this.

119
00:07:37.270 --> 00:07:42.100
She goes like this. Okay. I mean, and then half is Epic. And I was like,

120
00:07:42.340 --> 00:07:45.370
Oh, she's just doing it too much because she thinks,

121
00:07:46.660 --> 00:07:49.660
she thinks your boy can unhinge his jaw. You know what I mean?

122
00:07:50.320 --> 00:07:52.960
Maybe I'm a boa constrictor. You put a Southern from you put anything.

123
00:07:53.050 --> 00:07:56.860
I don't stop. I stop eating when there's no Mar

124
00:07:59.230 --> 00:08:02.320
what's his. When people are like, ah, that's enough for me? Boom.

125
00:08:02.380 --> 00:08:06.880
That's up portions, dude. How much did you make?

126
00:08:10.030 --> 00:08:11.890
So I said, get me the largest is all right.

127
00:08:14.350 --> 00:08:18.520
<v 0>So they brought the large dude, what is that?</v>

128
00:08:20.020 --> 00:08:22.000
Oh, no

129
00:08:25.600 --> 00:08:26.433
water.

130
00:08:26.650 --> 00:08:31.030
<v 1>Um, so, so they brought the large and uh,</v>

131
00:08:33.070 --> 00:08:35.110
is that going to be annoying on thing? Okay.

132
00:08:35.350 --> 00:08:38.410
So they brought the large and it was, you know,

133
00:08:38.411 --> 00:08:40.480
like if you go to someplace like a subway, if you get the large,

134
00:08:40.481 --> 00:08:42.880
it's two halves, dude, it was four.

135
00:08:44.170 --> 00:08:45.430
<v 0>Ah, four.</v>

136
00:08:48.700 --> 00:08:53.530
<v 1>And, um, and it was unbelievable.</v>

137
00:08:54.070 --> 00:08:58.620
And I was like, Oh no. And I didn't stop eating. I ate the whole.

138
00:08:59.980 --> 00:09:02.470
<v 0>It's gross. So gross.</v>

139
00:09:03.880 --> 00:09:06.820
<v 1>And ate the whole thing. And Garrett didn't because he's a real person.</v>
