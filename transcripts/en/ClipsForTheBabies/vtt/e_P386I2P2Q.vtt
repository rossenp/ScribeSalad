00:00:01.980 --> 00:00:05.550
<v 0>Uh, thank God comedian, because they say things that if I was a politician,</v>

2
00:00:05.551 --> 00:00:09.540
my race would end immediately all the time. No matter what. Um,

3
00:00:09.570 --> 00:00:12.060
but it's all good. You can't even be Johnny Depp nowadays.

4
00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:17.280
Johnny Depp can't even do it guys. Turn it. What happened at Johnny Depp?

5
00:00:17.281 --> 00:00:19.620
Everyone hates him. All of a sudden, all of a sudden everyone's like,

6
00:00:19.660 --> 00:00:23.040
you know what, actually, Johnny Depp,

7
00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:27.930
everyone loved Johnny Depp. He was like the guy.

8
00:00:28.590 --> 00:00:32.430
And then all of a sudden, everyone was like, you know what? Nah,

9
00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:37.920
why? Cause he dressed like an Indian a few times. What happened?

10
00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:42.210
White guy can't dress like an Indian anymore. Nope. Can't

11
00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:47.160
you see that? Your ad? Um,

12
00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:52.500
the is a Christian Dior. Is that what it was? Uh, whatever it was

13
00:00:55.470 --> 00:00:59.250
Johnny Depp is canceled. Right? So it's all good.

14
00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:02.550
Cancel. Culture's crazy, man.

15
00:01:05.310 --> 00:01:08.580
You mother are cancels. That's what I'm going to start calling you.

16
00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:11.580
I don't know if that's probably a thing already, but your counselors,

17
00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:15.840
Johnny Depp, your ad pulled a mid cultural appropriation outcry.

18
00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:21.150
It's crazy. These buckled to these, these peeps. You know what?

19
00:01:21.151 --> 00:01:21.961
It should just be. You know what?

20
00:01:21.961 --> 00:01:26.280
It should just be that ads should just be full polled because it's stupid.

21
00:01:26.910 --> 00:01:30.750
How about that? Have you seen it? He's dressed like a.

22
00:01:33.620 --> 00:01:38.150
You're not Indian. Uh, you know what I mean?

23
00:01:39.710 --> 00:01:42.050
Johnny Depp railing on the, what is he doing?

24
00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:44.720
Even do your survive.

25
00:01:45.680 --> 00:01:47.480
That's a CAC to call it salvage.

26
00:01:49.820 --> 00:01:54.350
Like don't have two earrings in one ear. Hey,

27
00:01:54.380 --> 00:01:56.870
is your ear one ear? Is it two ears?

28
00:01:58.820 --> 00:01:59.653
Johnny Depp,

29
00:01:59.990 --> 00:02:04.820
digging a hole and burying a necklace and putting all his jewelry in

30
00:02:04.821 --> 00:02:07.070
there under a rock. Hey,

31
00:02:07.100 --> 00:02:11.630
that's not the Dr. Johnny. Depp's insane period. That's it.

32
00:02:11.930 --> 00:02:14.570
But why do we hate him? He doesn't know.

33
00:02:14.870 --> 00:02:17.030
He's been famous since he was three.

34
00:02:19.880 --> 00:02:20.713
<v 1>See, here's the thing.</v>

35
00:02:20.780 --> 00:02:24.320
<v 0>Cultural appropriation and cancel culture. Cancel culture was.</v>

36
00:02:27.290 --> 00:02:27.500
<v 1>People.</v>

37
00:02:27.500 --> 00:02:31.850
<v 0>Well, you had it, man. You had it right there. You had it right there.</v>

38
00:02:33.260 --> 00:02:35.840
It was on and popping dude.

39
00:02:39.230 --> 00:02:43.220
We did too much, uh, guys and.

40
00:02:43.730 --> 00:02:46.670
They did too much. And they were, and they were,

41
00:02:46.790 --> 00:02:49.670
they were on top for too long and they were boring as.

42
00:02:50.480 --> 00:02:54.620
And they were abusing their power. And then the people were like, you know what?

43
00:02:54.890 --> 00:02:55.671
That ain't cool.

44
00:02:55.671 --> 00:02:59.650
And everyone started to listen because they were right because they were right.

45
00:03:01.510 --> 00:03:04.660
All this me too, all this cancel culture, all this cultural propagation.

46
00:03:04.810 --> 00:03:07.180
Everyone was like, you know what? Maybe these people have a point. Maybe,

47
00:03:07.270 --> 00:03:10.480
maybe everyone else has a point. Maybe white guys were on top for too long.

48
00:03:10.600 --> 00:03:15.100
And they just got to, you know, big for their britches.

49
00:03:15.820 --> 00:03:18.640
And then what happened was you were like the hot ch you know what?

50
00:03:18.640 --> 00:03:22.360
You were like the hot chick that we just started dating,

51
00:03:22.510 --> 00:03:26.170
that the world just started dating. You were the hot chick. And you were like,

52
00:03:26.200 --> 00:03:30.190
God, look at this girl, walking into this cafe.

53
00:03:30.550 --> 00:03:35.100
Look at them. Look at them, you know, all the, the, the,

54
00:03:35.101 --> 00:03:39.220
the dudes were look at them, look at them, dead fish, look at a thin waist.

55
00:03:39.250 --> 00:03:43.930
Look at a backside. He goes on for days. And we were listening to you, dude,

56
00:03:44.290 --> 00:03:47.470
because you walked in and you were the most bang in his chick ever.

57
00:03:47.710 --> 00:03:51.040
You would like to check that all of a sudden turned like 21, 22,

58
00:03:51.041 --> 00:03:52.540
that everyone was starting to pay attention,

59
00:03:52.541 --> 00:03:55.000
to figuring out how to do her makeup. And we're like, wow.

60
00:03:56.050 --> 00:03:57.910
And we started dating. You cancel culture.

61
00:03:57.911 --> 00:04:02.140
We started dating the out of you dude. And about three,

62
00:04:02.141 --> 00:04:03.850
four or five months in which is, you know,

63
00:04:03.851 --> 00:04:08.380
a year in whatever the you want to say it. He realized, Holy, man,

64
00:04:08.650 --> 00:04:11.200
you're a lot. You're a lot to deal with.

65
00:04:12.250 --> 00:04:15.310
And you're complaining way too much.

66
00:04:16.630 --> 00:04:19.990
And that's what happened. And then we started to get, okay, you know what?

67
00:04:20.710 --> 00:04:23.980
We were, we were having sex. We were laying you out. And it was funny.

68
00:04:24.430 --> 00:04:27.460
Having romantic dinners, learning about you, dude,

69
00:04:27.640 --> 00:04:32.080
we were learning about you canceled culture and we were on your

70
00:04:32.081 --> 00:04:37.000
side and you just did take it back. I don't want this.

71
00:04:37.001 --> 00:04:41.650
It's not good enough. We, you, you did that one too many times.

72
00:04:42.580 --> 00:04:47.020
You went, I don't like the temperature one too many times.

73
00:04:48.460 --> 00:04:52.120
And then all of a sudden we were like, you know what? We can't win.

74
00:04:53.620 --> 00:04:58.030
it. Johnny Depp. Can't wear turquoise now. it.

75
00:04:58.690 --> 00:05:03.580
You can't, we can't win. If we can't, when we're out, if we can't win,

76
00:05:03.700 --> 00:05:05.110
we wash our hands.

77
00:05:09.520 --> 00:05:11.860
I've said this before. We don't care what you buy.

78
00:05:11.890 --> 00:05:14.470
I don't care what you believe in, believe in what you want to believe in.

79
00:05:14.650 --> 00:05:19.000
But you can't. I care about the way you believe in it.

80
00:05:21.010 --> 00:05:25.660
That's the thing. You were the hot chick that was banging. You had it all,

81
00:05:25.780 --> 00:05:28.780
all you had to do was pick the right to complain about.

82
00:05:32.530 --> 00:05:36.040
You know, it's fine to walk into a guy's place for the first time and be like,

83
00:05:36.250 --> 00:05:39.310
Oh, you keep the couch over. Here we go.

84
00:05:40.960 --> 00:05:45.340
We're blinded by Teddy's. Yeah. Maybe the couch would,

85
00:05:47.290 --> 00:05:50.110
maybe the couch would look better. Yeah. I, uh, okay.

86
00:05:50.111 --> 00:05:53.890
Maybe the couch you have the wrong, the end,

87
00:05:53.920 --> 00:05:56.290
the table should be not in the middle of the two couches.

88
00:05:56.291 --> 00:05:57.410
It should be on the end of the couches.

89
00:05:57.411 --> 00:06:01.750
And you should L the couch so you can watch the bachelor with me better. Uh,

90
00:06:03.220 --> 00:06:05.110
yeah. Oh yeah. I guess I didn't.

91
00:06:06.340 --> 00:06:07.660
What were the windows where we had it like that?

92
00:06:07.810 --> 00:06:10.270
Because when guys come over for game night, we use the table to,

93
00:06:11.500 --> 00:06:15.670
but I guess you're right though. What are you saying instead of,

94
00:06:15.671 --> 00:06:20.230
I guess you're right though in real life is blinded by

95
00:06:21.100 --> 00:06:23.140
Teddy's. Yeah.

96
00:06:23.141 --> 00:06:26.800
The couch should be an L shape because of your waistline.

97
00:06:27.250 --> 00:06:31.480
Ah, see, that's the thing, dude.

98
00:06:31.481 --> 00:06:36.460
And then what happened was you could just move the couch too much,

99
00:06:36.490 --> 00:06:40.630
dude. And now when you say something's cultural appropriation,

100
00:06:42.250 --> 00:06:43.750
or if you say, you know,

101
00:06:44.710 --> 00:06:48.910
I sucked at and T Aziz Ansari's Dick and it was.

102
00:06:49.900 --> 00:06:54.190
We go like this, Hey dude, I liked the couch.

103
00:06:54.191 --> 00:06:55.390
The other way.

104
00:06:58.360 --> 00:07:02.650
I liked the end table on the end of the

105
00:07:02.651 --> 00:07:06.220
couch. I don't like it. I like it.

106
00:07:06.460 --> 00:07:08.380
I like it separating the two couches.

107
00:07:08.560 --> 00:07:12.490
So now we're going back to playing game that you go ahead.

108
00:07:14.560 --> 00:07:18.850
If Johnny Depp can't wear turquoise, then we're going back to game night, man.

109
00:07:23.710 --> 00:07:28.480
You could be banging his face, but everyone gets tired of the relationship, man.

110
00:07:29.050 --> 00:07:33.700
So be careful what you complain about. That's it? That's it.

111
00:07:34.210 --> 00:07:38.470
When you start saying, you know, ah, Chris Hardwick did this though.

112
00:07:38.471 --> 00:07:40.960
And then the, and then Chris Parker is where I got the text messages right here.

113
00:07:40.961 --> 00:07:45.220
This is the proof. Oh, we're back to playing game night, man. Now,

114
00:07:45.250 --> 00:07:48.520
do I know enough about those situations now? I don't.

115
00:07:49.060 --> 00:07:52.750
Is it okay to talk about what I'm talking about? Maybe am I comedian? Yeah.

116
00:07:52.780 --> 00:07:56.890
So does it really matter? No, cancel me.

117
00:07:57.520 --> 00:08:02.290
I don't know whatever it's like, believe what you want,

118
00:08:03.700 --> 00:08:05.860
but once you hit that, you know,

119
00:08:05.861 --> 00:08:10.030
the pendulum you're up for everyone who actually really does have a problem.

120
00:08:10.990 --> 00:08:14.140
And that's it. And that's all I have to say about that side of the, Nora.
