00:00:01.350 --> 00:00:03.240
<v 0>I was in Phoenix and, um,</v>

2
00:00:05.820 --> 00:00:10.020
Calen was doing a show there. I went there just so's, you know,

3
00:00:11.100 --> 00:00:15.570
Calen was doing a show there and I went on

4
00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:20.850
stage. I went, I connected with the radio station and I went on stage.

5
00:00:21.930 --> 00:00:25.650
They said it was cool. And I interrupted his show. That's Brian Callan.

6
00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:28.320
A lot of you guys probably don't know who he is. Okay.

7
00:00:29.040 --> 00:00:31.620
Cause he's a young comic coming up 52

8
00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:37.850
and starting to look. It's all good. Callan. You starting to look like politics.

9
00:00:39.440 --> 00:00:42.230
It's all good. Yeah. You start to look like a politician.

10
00:00:42.380 --> 00:00:47.120
You start to look like an actor playing politician. It's all good. Yar.

11
00:00:47.720 --> 00:00:50.270
It's all good. We are.

12
00:00:51.650 --> 00:00:52.790
And um,

13
00:00:53.360 --> 00:00:56.870
I went to go do that and I,

14
00:00:57.140 --> 00:01:01.190
I went in and there's footage. We'll release it later, but

15
00:01:03.080 --> 00:01:05.300
it was, I don't even want to say too much about it, but man,

16
00:01:05.450 --> 00:01:06.470
let me just tell you this.

17
00:01:07.910 --> 00:01:12.770
It was so amazing to do

18
00:01:12.771 --> 00:01:17.330
that and share that moment with him. Like he's one of my best friends, you know,

19
00:01:17.660 --> 00:01:21.110
and to see the look on his face, like the pure, what the,

20
00:01:21.830 --> 00:01:26.570
but joy, but like, why are you here? And then we started roasting each other,

21
00:01:26.571 --> 00:01:28.820
just being silly. I was out there for maybe eight minutes.

22
00:01:28.821 --> 00:01:31.820
I let them do the rest of the day. Obviously I'm not going to just take it.

23
00:01:31.821 --> 00:01:36.590
I should have sent them off and just been like, I'll do my. Uh,

24
00:01:36.620 --> 00:01:40.790
but uh, yeah, it was so funny, dude. He,

25
00:01:41.450 --> 00:01:45.350
they were in the middle of it. He says, Hey man, what the are you doing?

26
00:01:46.010 --> 00:01:50.630
Doing hair? And I started laughing, dude. He wore a gray shirt,

27
00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:55.700
dude. It's so funny. It was so funny, dude. Here's the other thing too.

28
00:01:55.701 --> 00:01:58.940
Don't ever wear a gray shirt when you're performing. No. Why?

29
00:01:59.180 --> 00:02:02.810
A lot of falls under your armpits now. Kalin. Why weren't you sweating?

30
00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:07.280
It's either because you weren't working hard or you got Botox shot in yarn pits.

31
00:02:07.550 --> 00:02:10.940
Now one time, a big, big comedian told me that that's what he did.

32
00:02:10.941 --> 00:02:14.240
And I thought it was gross. And I thought, wow, that's gross. And he said, yeah,

33
00:02:14.270 --> 00:02:17.390
but you don't get sweaty pits. And I thought, but you man,

34
00:02:18.590 --> 00:02:22.610
why would you want to not get sweaty pits a man?

35
00:02:23.120 --> 00:02:25.790
And I thought maybe I should do that. And he said, you should do it. And I said,

36
00:02:26.090 --> 00:02:28.100
yeah, even though I knew well,

37
00:02:28.101 --> 00:02:32.480
shore would never do it because man

38
00:02:35.240 --> 00:02:38.270
something, man, when I was a kid, I used to look. I had a buddy who had that,

39
00:02:38.330 --> 00:02:41.810
got that upper lip, sweat. You know, guys will get that upper lip. Sweat.

40
00:02:41.990 --> 00:02:44.180
What the is that? Dude?

41
00:02:44.360 --> 00:02:48.170
Just beads of sweat above your top lip. Hey man,

42
00:02:48.230 --> 00:02:52.370
it's not hot there. Hey dude, it's hot in your armpits,

43
00:02:52.670 --> 00:02:57.560
in your and on your feet. And if it's hot on your upper lip,

44
00:02:57.920 --> 00:03:02.650
figure it out. Don't go outside. Always have ice on you. Okay.

45
00:03:06.330 --> 00:03:08.880
<v 1>Man, dude, I forgot.</v>

46
00:03:09.090 --> 00:03:12.630
<v 0>Get his name, but he always had upper lip sweat and I would look at that, dude.</v>

47
00:03:12.690 --> 00:03:15.300
You think I wouldn't look at that. You think I wouldn't look at that.

48
00:03:15.660 --> 00:03:18.660
I would try. Even as a kid to look at that while he was talking,

49
00:03:20.370 --> 00:03:23.280
I would try to even look at that while he was talking, knowing well,

50
00:03:23.281 --> 00:03:25.650
he might catch me, but that's what I was a kid dude.

51
00:03:25.740 --> 00:03:28.140
That's how much I didn't give a. Even as a five-year-olds

52
00:03:31.460 --> 00:03:36.450
so rude. Um, but yeah, I did that. That's the kind of kid I was dude.

53
00:03:37.560 --> 00:03:41.490
That's the kind of kid I was. And one time I saw Doug,

54
00:03:42.570 --> 00:03:47.070
whatever his name was. Oh man. One time I saw a kid doing the monkey bars.

55
00:03:47.250 --> 00:03:51.540
Hey children's playgrounds make them safer.

56
00:03:52.020 --> 00:03:55.260
Actually, I haven't been on a children's playground in a long time.

57
00:03:55.380 --> 00:03:57.210
I got to go and just not be creepy.

58
00:03:57.510 --> 00:04:00.390
I just got to go chill out and look and like a hoodie.

59
00:04:01.860 --> 00:04:05.160
I would feel creepy even being in one right now. But, but uh,

60
00:04:05.220 --> 00:04:08.670
going to a children's playground when you,

61
00:04:09.900 --> 00:04:11.130
Oh my God, they used to be,

62
00:04:12.660 --> 00:04:15.090
it used to be like go running through a children's playground.

63
00:04:15.150 --> 00:04:19.950
Used to be like going through a gauntlet. I mean, dude, everything was iron.

64
00:04:22.230 --> 00:04:24.630
<v 1>Seesaws were, you'd go.</v>

65
00:04:24.750 --> 00:04:29.640
<v 0>So high and then you'd get the stronger guy on the other side and he would kick</v>

66
00:04:29.641 --> 00:04:31.620
up and then your, uh,

67
00:04:31.680 --> 00:04:35.010
but would just slam into the ground with no cush.

68
00:04:35.910 --> 00:04:37.620
And it would just like shorten your spine.

69
00:04:37.621 --> 00:04:40.830
I'm probably supposed to be six foot five, except for say seesaws.

70
00:04:41.430 --> 00:04:45.420
Also what is called a Seesaw, you know? Um,

71
00:04:45.630 --> 00:04:49.950
and then there were monkey bars who dug, what the was his last name? Doug,

72
00:04:50.430 --> 00:04:51.720
something like Conrad.

73
00:04:52.380 --> 00:04:55.350
<v 1>Doug something, correct.</v>

74
00:04:56.100 --> 00:04:59.220
<v 0>Doug something. Anyway, he looked so much like a Doug.</v>

75
00:05:00.300 --> 00:05:02.190
<v 1>He was skinny and he.</v>

76
00:05:02.190 --> 00:05:04.890
<v 0>Was cool. I liked him. He came over once or twice and that's,</v>

77
00:05:04.891 --> 00:05:08.070
it really didn't work out, you know? But uh,

78
00:05:08.490 --> 00:05:12.420
he was doing the monkey bars and he was standing on the top rung of the monkey

79
00:05:12.421 --> 00:05:16.170
bar, you know, the, the latter part. And he was just chilling. And I was,

80
00:05:16.230 --> 00:05:17.580
I was on the monkey bars like this,

81
00:05:17.581 --> 00:05:22.530
just holding it as a five-year-old how old must've I been eight just holding

82
00:05:22.531 --> 00:05:23.370
it, watching Doug.

83
00:05:23.880 --> 00:05:28.680
And he was standing on it and he lost his foot grip and his feet just went funk

84
00:05:28.830 --> 00:05:33.240
and it went blank and his taint smash on the upper rung of the

85
00:05:33.570 --> 00:05:37.980
ladder. And he goes, And dude,

86
00:05:37.981 --> 00:05:42.180
he couldn't speak. And I was just like this, looking at him. And I thought,

87
00:05:42.270 --> 00:05:47.040
Oh no, he immediately started crying. And then I was like, are you, I was like,

88
00:05:47.100 --> 00:05:50.370
are you okay? And then he just ran to a teacher. That

89
00:05:52.140 --> 00:05:55.020
I would have to. No, I hope he's okay. He's probably okay though. But,

90
00:05:55.050 --> 00:05:58.760
but it eat. His tank. Got the up dude.

91
00:05:58.910 --> 00:06:00.230
When his taint hit the I thought.

92
00:06:02.180 --> 00:06:02.750
<v 1>And then.</v>

93
00:06:02.750 --> 00:06:05.270
<v 0>It was just, it was so brutal. I literally thought, Oh,</v>

94
00:06:05.271 --> 00:06:09.080
his balls exploded as a kid. I was just like this. His balls exploded.

95
00:06:15.280 --> 00:06:17.230
that. That's not even fun, dude.

96
00:06:17.710 --> 00:06:20.320
You don't want to do to my kid when he wants to go on the monkey bars,

97
00:06:20.350 --> 00:06:23.320
I go like this, get down, get down, dude, get down. And he'd be like, why not?

98
00:06:24.160 --> 00:06:27.070
Because it's not fun. Dude. Think about what you're doing. But I like to cry.

99
00:06:27.100 --> 00:06:30.490
I like to cross it. It's like, Whoa, just walk across,

100
00:06:30.520 --> 00:06:32.110
walk across on the bottom. It's fine.

101
00:06:32.380 --> 00:06:35.020
Walk on the ground from one end to the other, but let twos my hands. Why?

102
00:06:35.021 --> 00:06:37.660
Think about, why do Dominic?

103
00:06:37.780 --> 00:06:41.350
I'm going to murder my kid with logic for real. I'm 39.

104
00:06:41.380 --> 00:06:45.070
What are you going to argue with me? I know about all this. Yeah,

105
00:06:45.100 --> 00:06:47.170
but I like to do that and know my friends do that.

106
00:06:47.260 --> 00:06:52.060
So if they jumped off a bridge, what would you do? I dunno.

107
00:06:53.020 --> 00:06:56.890
Would you jump off a bridge now? All right, cool. So what's up now, dude?

108
00:06:58.930 --> 00:07:03.670
Why crawling across your hands? I thought it was fun, but I guess that's not.

109
00:07:04.360 --> 00:07:09.010
Yeah. You're right now. You're right now. Okay.

110
00:07:10.480 --> 00:07:14.560
What do you want to do? Let's get ice cream.

111
00:07:15.610 --> 00:07:19.270
No. Why not? You tell me

112
00:07:22.810 --> 00:07:26.140
Because they only eat after dinner, like late at night,

113
00:07:26.170 --> 00:07:30.760
because that's when you want it the most that's right. Because why?

114
00:07:32.590 --> 00:07:35.380
Because you said that's the right thing. That's the right time to ice cream.

115
00:07:36.820 --> 00:07:41.500
Rephrase that because that's the right time to eat ice cream.

116
00:07:45.910 --> 00:07:50.590
Yes. Good boy. Now let's go to the gym. That I'm six.

117
00:07:56.140 --> 00:07:57.160
<v 1>Oh dude.</v>

118
00:08:01.390 --> 00:08:02.223
dude.

119
00:08:04.810 --> 00:08:07.570
<v 0>That I want to wear shorts. That's fine. But also put on a shirt.</v>

120
00:08:07.571 --> 00:08:11.620
You can't have long sleeves and shorts. You look indecisive. Okay.

121
00:08:15.280 --> 00:08:16.113
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

122
00:08:16.990 --> 00:08:21.580
<v 0>Man. My, my kid is going to be like, the other kids are going to be like,</v>

123
00:08:23.170 --> 00:08:24.490
they're going to think about it. They're going to,

124
00:08:24.790 --> 00:08:27.370
my kid's going to be like saying to the other kids.

125
00:08:27.371 --> 00:08:32.080
And they're going to be like, who the is that? Like as a, like a, his home?

126
00:08:33.610 --> 00:08:37.870
What the heck I, sorry, I can't go into monkey bars. Why?

127
00:08:38.230 --> 00:08:42.340
Because you could just walk across on the bottom. Yeah. But that takes off.

128
00:08:42.460 --> 00:08:46.840
That takes away the whole fun of it. No. Why? Think about it.

129
00:08:50.410 --> 00:08:54.430
Well, I like to use my hands. Why? Because it's fun to use the hands.

130
00:08:56.250 --> 00:08:59.450
Cause you're in the air a little bit. I guess that's actually enough.

131
00:08:59.580 --> 00:09:01.920
I'll nevermind. They're just all boring kids.

132
00:09:02.100 --> 00:09:05.850
Cause of me just like getting calls from other parents.

133
00:09:06.530 --> 00:09:10.490
<v 1>Hello? Hey. Hi. Is this Chris? D'Elia? Yeah.</v>

134
00:09:11.090 --> 00:09:13.070
Hi. Yeah. So, um.

135
00:09:13.310 --> 00:09:17.470
<v 0>Tommy came home and he, he had,</v>

136
00:09:18.110 --> 00:09:18.921
I don't know how to say this,

137
00:09:18.921 --> 00:09:21.890
but he told your kid told him that he's not allowed to do the monkey bars.

138
00:09:22.040 --> 00:09:25.970
Cause it's not fun. And that was your way. That was your rule. Yeah.

139
00:09:26.660 --> 00:09:28.550
Okay. So, um,

140
00:09:29.510 --> 00:09:34.010
I don't think that that's cool that your kid is telling my kid not to do on the

141
00:09:34.011 --> 00:09:36.140
playground and that is coming from you.

142
00:09:36.560 --> 00:09:41.120
<v 1>Really? Yeah. Why? Well,</v>

143
00:09:41.121 --> 00:09:42.350
because my kid likes to do the money.

144
00:09:42.380 --> 00:09:45.320
<v 0>Keep ours. Well can't you just do it walking across from the bottom.</v>

145
00:09:49.100 --> 00:09:49.160
<v 1>Okay.</v>

146
00:09:49.160 --> 00:09:50.300
<v 0>Yeah. I don't know. Look,</v>

147
00:09:50.301 --> 00:09:52.100
he's just supposed to do what he wants to think about that.

148
00:09:52.130 --> 00:09:54.050
The monkey bars and then break it down. Why is it fun? Why?

149
00:09:54.200 --> 00:09:57.380
Cause you're in the air because you're higher up. Yeah, no I understand.

150
00:09:57.381 --> 00:10:00.890
But doesn't that you're three feet above the ground. If that's fun to you,

151
00:10:01.970 --> 00:10:04.730
then you're a piece of. That's like nothing different.

152
00:10:08.150 --> 00:10:10.100
I mean, I guess you're right. It's just three feet.

153
00:10:15.020 --> 00:10:17.840
[inaudible] if you'd like to make a call, please hang up and try again.

154
00:10:18.020 --> 00:10:20.540
Message C too.

155
00:10:22.550 --> 00:10:25.040
And then just me eat an ice cream with my kid at 11.

156
00:10:25.400 --> 00:10:26.233
<v 1>Yeah,</v>

157
00:10:29.270 --> 00:10:30.950
