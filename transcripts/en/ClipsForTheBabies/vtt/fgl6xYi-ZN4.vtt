00:00:13.820 --> 00:00:17.750
<v 0>Here we go. It's episode one 75. And you know what? I don't know. I don't know.</v>

2
00:00:18.410 --> 00:00:23.030
I straight up don't know. I didn't record Monday because the world was on fire.

3
00:00:23.031 --> 00:00:25.400
I didn't record Tuesday because the world was on fire.

4
00:00:26.630 --> 00:00:29.270
I don't know if the world's still on fire, but it's Wednesday.

5
00:00:29.271 --> 00:00:32.900
So I decided to do it because maybe people want to laugh. I don't know. I just,

6
00:00:33.320 --> 00:00:37.370
I just don't know. Um, I do know that the world is,

7
00:00:37.510 --> 00:00:41.560
is and it gets worse and worse by the day, man. I thought COVID was real.

8
00:00:41.620 --> 00:00:44.990
You remember? COVID do you remember Corona virus?

9
00:00:46.070 --> 00:00:50.870
Do you remember it? Coronavirus is getting real well,

10
00:00:50.990 --> 00:00:55.820
it got real and it had nothing to do with Corona virus because uh,

11
00:00:55.850 --> 00:00:57.830
people are riding and looting out there.

12
00:00:58.160 --> 00:01:00.740
And part of me wants to be like don't ride or loot.

13
00:01:00.950 --> 00:01:03.290
And part of me wants to be like, dude, I get it.

14
00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:11.360
I keep thinking of that clip. That Tupac said when he's like,

15
00:01:12.860 --> 00:01:15.320
you know, well,

16
00:01:15.321 --> 00:01:18.170
when you're it's like opening the door and seeing a party and all the people are

17
00:01:18.171 --> 00:01:21.920
in there throwing salamis and they all got food and they're having a party.

18
00:01:21.921 --> 00:01:24.260
And I say, Hey, can we have some of the food?

19
00:01:24.410 --> 00:01:26.900
And then everybody in the party says, Oh, we don't have any food.

20
00:01:26.901 --> 00:01:28.670
I don't know what you're talking about. And he says, okay.

21
00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:31.730
And then the next day you come by and say, Hey, can we please have food?

22
00:01:31.731 --> 00:01:34.580
And we're singing. Can we have food? Can we please have food? And he say, Oh,

23
00:01:34.581 --> 00:01:36.530
we can't, we don't even know what to talk about. There's no food here.

24
00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:40.670
You come back a week later. It's not singing anymore. It's give us some food.

25
00:01:40.671 --> 00:01:43.730
We want some food. And then they're like, well, we don't have food.

26
00:01:43.731 --> 00:01:46.760
We don't know what you're talking about a year later, two years later,

27
00:01:46.761 --> 00:01:49.250
you're going to be coming in and you're gonna be like, give me that food.

28
00:01:50.300 --> 00:01:54.860
I keep thinking about that clip because people tried

29
00:01:55.370 --> 00:01:57.860
Nealon and people didn't want to hear that.

30
00:01:58.640 --> 00:02:00.290
There were a lot of drew breezes out there.

31
00:02:01.220 --> 00:02:03.890
People tried Nealon and that didn't work.

32
00:02:06.050 --> 00:02:08.510
Okay. So maybe then we don't need as many windows.

33
00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:13.220
I don't know what the answer is, but I don't know what the answer is.

34
00:02:13.370 --> 00:02:17.090
That's the thing. What I know is

35
00:02:19.400 --> 00:02:23.990
I have no idea how much racism is in the world. I keep thinking. I know.

36
00:02:24.050 --> 00:02:28.670
And then some other opens my eyes to it. I posted a thing.

37
00:02:28.700 --> 00:02:33.050
Three or four days ago, two days ago, I don't know about black lives matter.

38
00:02:33.051 --> 00:02:35.990
And I couldn't believe the comments that I thought maybe I should disable

39
00:02:35.991 --> 00:02:38.000
comments on this. And I thought I had, I it. And I didn't.

40
00:02:38.420 --> 00:02:40.130
And I can't believe the comments under it.

41
00:02:40.940 --> 00:02:44.990
I can't believe the racist under there. And I can't believe it.

42
00:02:45.110 --> 00:02:47.930
Cause I don't know. Cause I'm a white guy. I don't deal with this every day.

43
00:02:49.280 --> 00:02:52.970
You know? And I guess that's what they say. That's privilege. But I had no idea,

44
00:02:52.971 --> 00:02:56.630
man. I saw people all lives matter, man. It's racist to say black lives matter.

45
00:02:56.780 --> 00:03:01.750
Are you kidding me? If you think that's racist,

46
00:03:02.800 --> 00:03:07.540
put on a bunch of put on a vest with a bunch of hot pockets and go hiking, dude.

47
00:03:07.541 --> 00:03:08.620
That is insane.

48
00:03:10.510 --> 00:03:15.220
It's not look I say black lives matter. Someone says black lives matter.

49
00:03:15.221 --> 00:03:19.210
And then someone else says all lives, Oh actually all lives matter. And then,

50
00:03:19.211 --> 00:03:21.160
you know what I say? I like bacon.

51
00:03:23.500 --> 00:03:26.560
As long as we're going to be saying that doesn't pertain to the last that we

52
00:03:26.561 --> 00:03:28.690
said, I like bacon

53
00:03:31.360 --> 00:03:36.340
also. It's the same thing. If you say black lives, that's the whole point, man.

54
00:03:37.210 --> 00:03:38.260
It's the whole point.

55
00:03:38.261 --> 00:03:42.340
And I'm sick of these telling people when they can and when they can't protest

56
00:03:42.400 --> 00:03:43.480
like drew Brees. Yeah.

57
00:03:43.510 --> 00:03:45.940
But you can't do it during the national Anthem because that's,

58
00:03:46.450 --> 00:03:47.860
you're disrespecting the flag.

59
00:03:48.010 --> 00:03:51.850
When would you like me to protest?

60
00:03:53.620 --> 00:03:57.280
Excuse me? Can I protest? What the are you talking about?

61
00:03:57.281 --> 00:04:01.090
That's not what protesting is. Protesting is on the protesting.

62
00:04:01.091 --> 00:04:03.430
If you're doing it when you're not supposed to,

63
00:04:06.360 --> 00:04:09.810
you're the little kid staying up at night after your parents told you not to.

64
00:04:10.590 --> 00:04:14.700
You're protesting. You're not protested. If you're sitting at noon,

65
00:04:14.850 --> 00:04:18.150
watching cartoons after your parents made you lunch,

66
00:04:18.570 --> 00:04:22.710
that's a protest that's doing what you're supposed to protesting is sitting in

67
00:04:22.711 --> 00:04:27.270
front of the TV with the squiggly lines in between the two channels on Skinemax

68
00:04:27.360 --> 00:04:32.160
and try to see a tit for one minute. That is protesting with your ticket,

69
00:04:32.161 --> 00:04:36.930
your hand that's dude, look,

70
00:04:36.931 --> 00:04:41.730
all I'm saying is kneeling. Wasn't working it. Wasn't working

71
00:04:43.770 --> 00:04:48.510
and I'm not condoning rioting and looting. I don't think that that's right.

72
00:04:49.440 --> 00:04:52.770
I don't think you should be out there breaking windows and like that.

73
00:04:54.510 --> 00:04:58.170
But what the do I know?

74
00:05:00.360 --> 00:05:05.040
I can't imagine how mad and here's the thing. Everyone should be that mad.

75
00:05:09.870 --> 00:05:12.600
You know, if some of us are up, then we're up.

76
00:05:14.640 --> 00:05:17.490
If some of us get up, then we are up.

77
00:05:19.860 --> 00:05:22.350
We're not good. If some of us are, dude,

78
00:05:22.351 --> 00:05:25.500
if you have a family and one of your kids is going through some,

79
00:05:26.070 --> 00:05:27.900
you're going through some as a family.

80
00:05:32.130 --> 00:05:36.930
It's just amazing. The people too. It's hard to keep some friends even. I mean,

81
00:05:36.931 --> 00:05:40.800
I see some friends out there posting that I'm just like, really, man,

82
00:05:41.940 --> 00:05:44.100
this is what you're going to die on this Hill.

83
00:05:48.180 --> 00:05:50.850
And it's hard too, because you want to be in the position where you're like,

84
00:05:50.851 --> 00:05:55.230
you know what? I want people to have their opinions. This is what America is.

85
00:05:55.231 --> 00:05:59.870
I want them to be able to express opinions and not be canceled because 40 people

86
00:05:59.871 --> 00:06:03.410
are getting canceled a day. Remember Jimmy Fallon,

87
00:06:03.411 --> 00:06:06.560
nobody even remembers that anymore. That was eight hours ago.

88
00:06:09.140 --> 00:06:12.260
Drew breeze now because he said, what the? Uh, you know,

89
00:06:12.261 --> 00:06:15.410
and I completely disagree with drew breeze. Like I just said,

90
00:06:15.411 --> 00:06:18.620
protesting is only protesting if you're doing it when you're not supposed to.

91
00:06:21.730 --> 00:06:24.100
<v 1>Hey, Hey, Hey, Hey, Hey, uh, Hadrian, breezeway.</v>

92
00:06:24.250 --> 00:06:26.680
<v 0>We think about black people and black lives matter. Well,</v>

93
00:06:26.681 --> 00:06:29.140
I don't think they should be disrespecting the flag. Oh cool, man.

94
00:06:30.040 --> 00:06:32.650
What the I'd have to do with anything. I like bacon.

95
00:06:34.450 --> 00:06:37.300
I would love to be that interviewer. Ah, so, okay.

96
00:06:37.301 --> 00:06:39.700
So you think nobody should disrespect the flag? Well,

97
00:06:39.701 --> 00:06:42.340
did you know something about me? I like bacon.

98
00:06:48.130 --> 00:06:53.080
I don't know, man. I don't know. I just, I don't know.

99
00:06:53.770 --> 00:06:56.740
I don't know what it's like to walk down the street as a black guy or a black

100
00:06:56.741 --> 00:07:01.480
woman. I don't know. And I won't ever know, uh,

101
00:07:02.530 --> 00:07:04.510
you know, I didn't know how I wanted to start this podcast.

102
00:07:04.511 --> 00:07:07.930
I didn't know if I wanted it to be serious or silly. I, you know,

103
00:07:09.340 --> 00:07:12.310
I don't want to try and tell anybody what to do because I hate that.

104
00:07:15.670 --> 00:07:19.060
The black, you know, the, the black square that people were posting.

105
00:07:19.061 --> 00:07:22.530
I didn't do that. Uh, the, the, what was a blackout Tuesday or whatever,

106
00:07:22.550 --> 00:07:25.390
God that was to me, it was like, yeah, everyone posted it.

107
00:07:25.420 --> 00:07:28.420
All of a sudden I look at Instagram, everything's black. It's like, I'm blind.

108
00:07:28.421 --> 00:07:30.520
I don't know what's going on. And then I look and I'm like, Oh,

109
00:07:30.521 --> 00:07:35.410
you're supposed to post this in solidarity. Look who really gives a.

110
00:07:35.770 --> 00:07:38.230
What you're posting on Instagram. Okay. I get it.

111
00:07:39.790 --> 00:07:43.540
I posted a black lives matter thing because I wanted to show my people that

112
00:07:43.541 --> 00:07:46.810
follow me, that I supported the movement and that's good, you know,

113
00:07:46.870 --> 00:07:49.780
it's not bad. Um,

114
00:07:50.350 --> 00:07:53.050
and then everyone started posting this black square and,

115
00:07:53.560 --> 00:07:57.070
and hashtag black lives matter. And then, and then people were like,

116
00:07:57.071 --> 00:07:58.660
you're gonna post the black guy plus the black square.

117
00:07:58.660 --> 00:08:02.380
Otherwise you're piece of. And then we were like, and then everyone was like,

118
00:08:02.410 --> 00:08:05.320
I don't know. And then before I even decided to post a black square and I,

119
00:08:05.350 --> 00:08:06.340
people were like, well,

120
00:08:06.341 --> 00:08:09.550
you up if you post a black square because you put black lives matter and it's

121
00:08:09.880 --> 00:08:11.470
called of the feed. And now we don't know what the,

122
00:08:11.830 --> 00:08:13.990
where to donate because we can't click the hashtag and see what a donut.

123
00:08:14.050 --> 00:08:16.570
We can click the hashtag and see what's going on. Some cops are shooting at,

124
00:08:17.060 --> 00:08:19.300
rubber bullets. We can't see it. We've got to click the hashtag.

125
00:08:19.360 --> 00:08:24.100
We can't see it. So you up posting the black square. Okay. Then you know what?

126
00:08:25.210 --> 00:08:27.430
Then my post is the black lives matter one. That was the last one I did.

127
00:08:27.431 --> 00:08:31.240
And that was the one where these are out here trying to get you canceled.

128
00:08:31.241 --> 00:08:34.900
Man puts a black, do it, do it, do it. You did it. You up, you up. You up.

129
00:08:38.620 --> 00:08:43.510
A lot of it is about complying, which is weird as, man. Um,

130
00:08:45.220 --> 00:08:47.200
like the, uh, the, um,

131
00:08:47.650 --> 00:08:51.340
there was a clip now and I had it saved and they deleted it.

132
00:08:52.000 --> 00:08:56.400
We're a bunch of white, white people were on the ground kneeling.

133
00:08:57.480 --> 00:09:00.270
Um, w renouncing,

134
00:09:00.271 --> 00:09:03.420
is that the right word there? Um,

135
00:09:03.930 --> 00:09:07.790
white privilege there we'll look. I promise never to be privileged.

136
00:09:07.791 --> 00:09:12.590
I promise to do as well as I can and lift up black people.

137
00:09:12.591 --> 00:09:15.140
And it was like, dude, Hey, you white people.

138
00:09:15.230 --> 00:09:18.410
That's that doesn't absolve. You,

139
00:09:18.650 --> 00:09:22.610
you think it's that easy? That's white privilege.

140
00:09:23.450 --> 00:09:26.900
You morons. Oh dude,

141
00:09:27.530 --> 00:09:31.460
let's get together in a park and sing racism over.

142
00:09:36.290 --> 00:09:40.460
No, dude, I want to protest against that protest.

143
00:09:43.140 --> 00:09:46.340
You don't get to absolve yourself in a afternoon.

144
00:09:47.600 --> 00:09:50.090
There's 500 years of slavery, whatever the it is.

145
00:09:50.240 --> 00:09:52.820
And you think because you go into a park and you're like,

146
00:09:52.890 --> 00:09:57.080
I'll lift up black people. I promise. And then you feel good about yourself.

147
00:09:57.140 --> 00:09:59.840
You leave. And you're just like, cool. Well, I guess I'm going to heaven.

148
00:10:00.170 --> 00:10:01.130
You're doing that for you.

149
00:10:04.670 --> 00:10:07.970
And this is where I would be in a audience. And people would be like,

150
00:10:09.920 --> 00:10:10.753
[inaudible],

151
00:10:13.310 --> 00:10:17.540
this is getting real. Remember Corona virus,

152
00:10:22.490 --> 00:10:24.650
man. Unbelievable

153
00:10:30.680 --> 00:10:31.730
Tibor college was

154
00:10:33.440 --> 00:10:37.940
it's so funny that some of these people just feel like they need to post

155
00:10:37.941 --> 00:10:42.860
because it's a PR move to bore college.

156
00:10:44.180 --> 00:10:47.360
Tibor college is committed to treating all people with respect because every

157
00:10:47.361 --> 00:10:52.340
person on the face of the earth matters to God treating people as if they do

158
00:10:52.341 --> 00:10:55.190
not matter misses the Mark that Jesus set for all of us,

159
00:10:55.191 --> 00:10:59.750
especially those who are followers of him. We desire to be peace, salt,

160
00:10:59.751 --> 00:11:02.510
and light in our world of violence, chaos, and evil.

161
00:11:02.780 --> 00:11:07.550
We want to overcome evil with good and bring healing to brokenness our faith

162
00:11:07.580 --> 00:11:12.380
in Jesus Christ empowers us to equip men and women to be instruments of peace,

163
00:11:12.410 --> 00:11:13.490
justice, and healing.

164
00:11:13.790 --> 00:11:18.320
We are taking actions that will help us live out this commitment to Christ his

165
00:11:18.321 --> 00:11:19.970
kingdom and our society.

166
00:11:21.080 --> 00:11:25.010
Several legis loaded in religion. Dude,

167
00:11:26.750 --> 00:11:29.360
just say, first of all, well,

168
00:11:30.470 --> 00:11:31.880
there's some evidence about these.

169
00:11:36.350 --> 00:11:38.390
Look at this guy tweeted to, to poor college.

170
00:11:38.420 --> 00:11:41.120
You threatened to every athlete that if they took a knee and peaceful protest,

171
00:11:41.121 --> 00:11:45.960
they would be suspended. Okay. So then what side are you on a?

172
00:11:48.380 --> 00:11:53.290
Come on, guys. Just shut the up. At this point, you,

173
00:11:53.291 --> 00:11:56.740
you made your bed just stay sleeping.

174
00:11:58.120 --> 00:12:02.830
It's like that. Leah Michelle girl, dude, I don't know her at all.

175
00:12:02.890 --> 00:12:07.330
Have zero clue, even really who she is. But I found out that she's on glee.

176
00:12:10.350 --> 00:12:14.460
<v 1>You know, after the fact that glee was on and uh.</v>

177
00:12:14.910 --> 00:12:18.420
<v 0>She was talking about what was the thing Lee and Michelle said</v>

178
00:12:19.890 --> 00:12:24.870
on Twitter, trying to look for it. Leah, Michelle.

179
00:12:27.060 --> 00:12:29.310
Um, yeah,

180
00:12:29.340 --> 00:12:34.140
find it can find it one fire.

181
00:12:35.940 --> 00:12:38.670
He didn't show it to me.

182
00:12:41.310 --> 00:12:45.840
Did you add it, dude? Can't find it. Great. Everyone's fired in the world.

183
00:12:47.580 --> 00:12:52.200
Can't find a meat. Yes, dude. How do you spell Michelle? Yes.

184
00:12:52.201 --> 00:12:55.590
One L not how you spell it. AIS got it.

185
00:12:56.670 --> 00:12:59.640
She wrote George Floyd did not diverse deserve this.

186
00:12:59.790 --> 00:13:04.020
This was not an isolated incident and a Mustang. Black lives matter, dude.

187
00:13:04.021 --> 00:13:08.520
And somebody on glee took her to town. Dude.

188
00:13:09.180 --> 00:13:13.560
She writes this girl's name is Sammy where I guess she was ugly to

189
00:13:13.860 --> 00:13:16.020
Illumio. Remember when you made my first television gig,

190
00:13:16.110 --> 00:13:18.900
tele television gig of living. Hell because I'll never forget.

191
00:13:19.080 --> 00:13:21.270
I believe he told everyone what, if you had the opportunity,

192
00:13:21.271 --> 00:13:24.360
you would in my wig amongst other traumatic microaggressions.

193
00:13:24.361 --> 00:13:27.030
That made me question a career in Hollywood, uh, God,

194
00:13:28.680 --> 00:13:32.340
and 486,000 likes.

195
00:13:39.330 --> 00:13:41.730
How are you going to go say you're going to and black people's wigs and then say

196
00:13:41.731 --> 00:13:45.120
black lives matter, obviously. Yay.

197
00:13:45.121 --> 00:13:47.160
You don't think that Andy,

198
00:13:47.161 --> 00:13:50.220
your Tibor college personified,

199
00:13:56.790 --> 00:13:57.361
Somebody wrote,

200
00:13:57.361 --> 00:14:01.770
I worked on glee and it was a known fact that Leah Michelle was a huge BITC.

201
00:14:01.771 --> 00:14:03.420
H I don't say.

202
00:14:07.170 --> 00:14:10.860
Not even a whispered thing on set. They outwardly resented her.

203
00:14:10.861 --> 00:14:13.290
I'm glad others are now aware of this type of person. She is so sorry.

204
00:14:13.470 --> 00:14:16.500
She's turned into, as you liked as a, I mean,

205
00:14:16.530 --> 00:14:20.610
I don't know about any of this. I kind of heard stuff about her,

206
00:14:20.640 --> 00:14:22.290
but after the fact,

207
00:14:22.291 --> 00:14:26.640
so I don't know if I don't know anything about it, but that's crazy.

208
00:14:26.641 --> 00:14:28.100
It's so weird that, and that gets it.

209
00:14:28.101 --> 00:14:32.550
And then she lost her sponsorship with happy go lucky or whatever the it is.

210
00:14:32.551 --> 00:14:34.260
Happy feed. I don't know what the she did.

211
00:14:34.290 --> 00:14:37.920
Some skincare thing that was like called happy go-lucky happy feet or some,

212
00:14:38.250 --> 00:14:41.900
or maybe it was a good living or eating healthy, whatever the it is. And,

213
00:14:41.901 --> 00:14:45.450
and then, uh, but this was the one that I saw. That was amazing.

214
00:14:46.890 --> 00:14:48.750
This was the one that I saw that was amazing.

215
00:14:48.900 --> 00:14:52.940
Her name is Lauren loves veggies and is an annoying vegan.

216
00:14:53.600 --> 00:14:58.430
Is that a double? Or is that a, what do you call it? A redundant dude. Vegans.

217
00:14:58.431 --> 00:14:59.990
Aren't all annoying.

218
00:15:00.710 --> 00:15:04.340
But if there's a high percentage of annoying people in veganism, of course,

219
00:15:05.030 --> 00:15:06.830
and I retweeted it and this is what she said,

220
00:15:09.020 --> 00:15:13.730
this needs to be said, here we go. Anytime somebody says,

221
00:15:13.731 --> 00:15:18.590
this needs to be said, guess what? Guess what? It doesn't need to be said.

222
00:15:18.620 --> 00:15:21.740
Okay. That's like saying that's like being someone who was like, trust me,

223
00:15:23.480 --> 00:15:25.550
horns. Trust me.

224
00:15:27.410 --> 00:15:28.640
Trust me.

225
00:15:28.790 --> 00:15:33.630
Push Whoa, whoop,

226
00:15:33.870 --> 00:15:37.310
whoop, whoop, whoop, whoop. Look what this girl said.

227
00:15:39.280 --> 00:15:41.890
<v 2>I feel like this needs to be said,</v>

228
00:15:42.250 --> 00:15:45.370
and I really wish that more people would connect these two dots,

229
00:15:45.850 --> 00:15:49.540
but black lives matter and animal lives matter.

230
00:15:53.530 --> 00:15:58.120
<v 0>Thinking, thinking, thinking, dude,</v>

231
00:15:58.240 --> 00:16:03.100
that is absolutely grenade material. What node?

232
00:16:03.101 --> 00:16:05.380
Hey, are you 11

233
00:16:07.060 --> 00:16:11.080
quick question. Did you come out of your mommy eight years ago?

234
00:16:14.770 --> 00:16:15.603
Hey,

235
00:16:15.640 --> 00:16:20.350
don't ever say black people and animals in the same

236
00:16:20.351 --> 00:16:25.210
sentence, unless you're saying, Hey, black people look out for those animals,

237
00:16:26.020 --> 00:16:29.080
dude. Are you out of your mind? Hey,

238
00:16:30.100 --> 00:16:32.830
who is your parents? Dude? I'm sorry, but like,

239
00:16:32.831 --> 00:16:33.850
let's just listen to that a little bit.

240
00:16:33.910 --> 00:16:36.040
<v 2>More people would connect these two dots,</v>

241
00:16:36.400 --> 00:16:40.240
but black lives matter and animal lives matters.

242
00:16:40.870 --> 00:16:42.790
Literally all sentient beings.

243
00:16:43.180 --> 00:16:44.500
<v 0>Oh dude. How about this?</v>

244
00:16:45.970 --> 00:16:48.310
Don't say Senti and beans to me.

245
00:16:48.640 --> 00:16:52.840
Don't ever say sentience being stupid.

246
00:16:53.560 --> 00:16:55.210
What are you? A robot?

247
00:16:56.410 --> 00:17:00.190
Sentience beings deserve equal rights

248
00:17:01.420 --> 00:17:04.540
from black people to animals, to flowers,

249
00:17:06.190 --> 00:17:10.570
sentient beings. If I ever find out what an actual sentence would be,

250
00:17:10.571 --> 00:17:12.280
I don't know what a number, what the umbrella is.

251
00:17:12.281 --> 00:17:14.890
I've sent you and beings I've ever find that out. That's it.

252
00:17:15.070 --> 00:17:17.470
I'm going to jump off a building. I don't want to know don't ever tell me.

253
00:17:17.471 --> 00:17:18.430
What is sent to you in being is.

254
00:17:21.280 --> 00:17:24.640
<v 2>Deserve a life free fear,</v>

255
00:17:25.180 --> 00:17:28.960
free from abuse, free from unjust prosecution.

256
00:17:29.050 --> 00:17:30.130
<v 0>I just say chicken by the way.</v>

257
00:17:31.270 --> 00:17:33.880
<v 2>No one, whether it's a human being,</v>

258
00:17:34.480 --> 00:17:38.770
especially ones with different colored skin than yours

259
00:17:39.730 --> 00:17:40.570
and animals.

260
00:17:41.110 --> 00:17:43.240
<v 0>No one, no one,</v>

261
00:17:43.660 --> 00:17:48.130
including people with different skin and animals. No one,

262
00:17:50.250 --> 00:17:53.120
no one. Whether it be, Oh, bird

263
00:17:56.120 --> 00:17:59.000
zebra, no one also.

264
00:18:00.440 --> 00:18:04.550
<v 2>Preachers the news because of their time to die. They don't deserve to die.</v>

265
00:18:05.990 --> 00:18:09.020
That's killing black people and stop killing animals.

266
00:18:09.980 --> 00:18:11.720
<v 0>Doubled down and said it again.</v>

267
00:18:12.500 --> 00:18:14.780
Maybe she was hoping that since the first time she got canceled,

268
00:18:14.781 --> 00:18:16.010
the second one would on cancel her.

269
00:18:17.900 --> 00:18:20.930
<v 2>Black lives matter movement with all the same.</v>

270
00:18:21.410 --> 00:18:24.740
<v 0>Oops. Oops, oops.</v>

271
00:18:25.430 --> 00:18:29.480
<v 2>All of it. And it's important. Each one of them is so individually important.</v>

272
00:18:29.630 --> 00:18:31.940
I really hope that people can start to connect the two.

273
00:18:32.900 --> 00:18:37.820
<v 0>I ate chicken. I ain't chicken, dude. I chicken and bacon today.</v>

274
00:18:45.680 --> 00:18:50.330
Oh. My friend just tweeted under her. This is gross and tone. Deaf and trash.

275
00:18:50.510 --> 00:18:55.070
Be better. Think better. Read other books. Stop this. Well. Right.

276
00:18:56.020 --> 00:19:00.380
Do dude read other books as a good wow man.

277
00:19:01.340 --> 00:19:06.290
Hey, read other books. Spin. Move in.

278
00:19:06.380 --> 00:19:08.180
You're out jumping through a window.

279
00:19:14.870 --> 00:19:18.770
Wow. That's amazing, dude. How'd you blow them up? Having sex with a chick. Wow.

280
00:19:18.800 --> 00:19:23.390
How'd you blow my back out that hard. Read other books. Sunglasses on

281
00:19:27.020 --> 00:19:31.790
Freeze frame is you jump out the window. Um, anyway.
