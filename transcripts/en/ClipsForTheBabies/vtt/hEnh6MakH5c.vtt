WEBVTT

1
00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:02.400
<v 0>And then there's other podcasts I listened to,</v>

2
00:00:02.670 --> 00:00:07.410
which was absolutely insane. You know, Keith Morrison

3
00:00:11.370 --> 00:00:14.250
from Dateline dude,

4
00:00:15.460 --> 00:00:20.010
the thing is called there's something about Pam.

5
00:00:20.790 --> 00:00:25.590
Oh, I'm sorry. The thing about Pam and I, I swear,

6
00:00:25.591 --> 00:00:27.540
I just listened to it because of the guy's voice.

7
00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:31.410
The first three episodes were banging. I was like, wait a second.

8
00:00:32.490 --> 00:00:37.470
And then I realized it was maybe just the guy's voice because Keith Morrison

9
00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:41.430
would do the way he does it. First of all, how's his face?

10
00:00:41.431 --> 00:00:44.100
His face it's so long.

11
00:00:44.101 --> 00:00:48.150
It looks like Clint Eastwood is looking at a fun house mirror.

12
00:00:51.060 --> 00:00:55.650
I mean, his face is largely Lima bean,

13
00:00:57.810 --> 00:01:01.470
Keith Lima, bean Morrison, dude.

14
00:01:02.490 --> 00:01:05.700
It's so funny, dude. I was listening to this. First of all,

15
00:01:05.701 --> 00:01:09.480
the first episode I was listening to in Atlantic city as I was going to bed,

16
00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:11.690
I got so creeped out that I had to stop listening to it.

17
00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:16.050
Cause I got scared and my. Yes. Is it all good? Yes.

18
00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:21.090
And Keith Morrison, dude, just he's this guy.

19
00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:27.620
<v 1>One close to the case, obviously,</v>

20
00:01:27.621 --> 00:01:31.850
you know the thing about Pam that was brought to you by Dateline NBC

21
00:01:32.510 --> 00:01:35.570
from Dateline, NBC, Kathy singer and Christine films. Right.

22
00:01:35.630 --> 00:01:39.230
<v 0>But the thing about Pam, you know,</v>

23
00:01:39.440 --> 00:01:43.130
love by the way, to Pam. That's how he's saying it.

24
00:01:44.420 --> 00:01:46.070
I know more about Pam.

25
00:01:46.610 --> 00:01:50.810
I know more about Pam than any of you know about Pam.

26
00:01:51.410 --> 00:01:56.150
I mean sings it here. Hold on. Just listen. God is,

27
00:01:56.151 --> 00:01:58.520
I don't know. Who's better. The guy from forensic file or is it okay for real.

28
00:01:58.880 --> 00:02:03.020
<v 1>5:00 PM then he ran errands for the next hour. Filled up.</v>

29
00:02:03.021 --> 00:02:07.070
His tank picked up cigarettes, dog food, couple of ice teas.

30
00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:10.070
He got to Mike's house for game night, about 6:00 PM.

31
00:02:10.430 --> 00:02:12.890
<v 0>Let me just show you that. I'll show you that part.</v>

32
00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:18.200
<v 1>Opt at Arby's and drove 30 or so more minutes to get home clocking</v>

33
00:02:18.201 --> 00:02:22.460
his arrival. Uh, nine 49 45. Okay. It's all good.

34
00:02:22.520 --> 00:02:24.320
According to official records,

35
00:02:24.710 --> 00:02:28.130
Russ made that night approximately 900.

36
00:02:28.340 --> 00:02:29.780
<v 0>Okay. She's going through the, Oh,</v>

37
00:02:29.840 --> 00:02:34.760
it got a little bit dark with it at nine 30 that night. No checked out.

38
00:02:35.870 --> 00:02:39.800
<v 1>But you could tell that something wasn't sitting right. Detective</v>

39
00:02:42.320 --> 00:02:46.070
Russ made that nine one one call at approximately nine 40.

40
00:02:47.690 --> 00:02:50.990
So his story checked out. Oh,

41
00:02:51.110 --> 00:02:55.310
but you could tell that something wasn't sitting right with detectives.

42
00:02:56.600 --> 00:02:59.920
<v 0>So good. But you could towel something.</v>

43
00:02:59.921 --> 00:03:04.750
Wasn't sitting right with detective dude.

44
00:03:06.220 --> 00:03:07.090
I got to find a good.

45
00:03:08.100 --> 00:03:11.820
<v 1>Uniforms. CSI detectives. I mean.</v>

46
00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:13.530
<v 0>There was one part where I took a screenshot of it.</v>

47
00:03:13.531 --> 00:03:17.640
Let me go get it because it was so funny the way he said, he says Pam,

48
00:03:19.650 --> 00:03:21.060
ah, Oh, here it is.

49
00:03:23.070 --> 00:03:26.550
Pam it's episode three at five.

50
00:03:27.210 --> 00:03:31.410
This is the I do. What an idiot. You know, I was like, Oh,

51
00:03:31.620 --> 00:03:36.030
got to the way he says the way he says.

52
00:03:37.410 --> 00:03:39.030
<v 1>He hears all of the evidence.</v>

53
00:03:39.030 --> 00:03:41.130
<v 0>This guy, you can just hear, you get so mad. He punches.</v>

54
00:03:43.110 --> 00:03:45.150
<v 1>And by all the evidence,</v>

55
00:03:45.810 --> 00:03:49.620
he meant really everything to do with cam.

56
00:03:55.680 --> 00:04:00.090
<v 0>And by all the evidence, human, everything to do with</v>

57
00:04:01.770 --> 00:04:02.603
power.

58
00:04:05.640 --> 00:04:05.911
<v 1>Wow.</v>

59
00:04:05.911 --> 00:04:10.890
I love going to dig into all that ball battery in this country

60
00:04:10.891 --> 00:04:11.880
that can, can take Russ.

61
00:04:12.120 --> 00:04:16.500
I got to play that again by all the evidence you meant really

62
00:04:16.590 --> 00:04:20.190
everything to do with Pam. Ah,

63
00:04:25.050 --> 00:04:25.883
free letters.

64
00:04:26.880 --> 00:04:29.820
<v 0>The guy goes Pam. Oh,</v>

65
00:04:29.821 --> 00:04:34.560
they'll balls on Keith Morrison. See that's the thing, dude. God is good.

66
00:04:36.270 --> 00:04:40.500
And of course there were things about Pam that we didn't know about.

67
00:04:41.820 --> 00:04:46.590
When, when we figured it out, we learned that there was more than meets the eye.

68
00:04:48.090 --> 00:04:51.090
<v 1>With all these inconsistencies.</v>

69
00:04:51.510 --> 00:04:55.980
Joel decided to look for other possible holes in the prosecution's case,

70
00:04:56.610 --> 00:04:58.620
Mike, that polygraph test.

71
00:04:59.160 --> 00:05:02.970
<v 0>God, I want to hang with this guy. I mean,</v>

72
00:05:02.971 --> 00:05:04.440
imagine just chilling with the dude.

73
00:05:06.750 --> 00:05:08.970
Just like going to get some food.

74
00:05:11.250 --> 00:05:11.911
Careful.

75
00:05:11.911 --> 00:05:16.410
There's a yellow light and it might turn red

76
00:05:16.440 --> 00:05:20.460
before you cross the line. You'd just be like,

77
00:05:20.490 --> 00:05:21.690
that's so interesting.

78
00:05:24.150 --> 00:05:28.200
Oh the air bag burst it out.

79
00:05:34.170 --> 00:05:37.590
You might want to watch out. There's a sharp part.

80
00:05:38.130 --> 00:05:42.510
There's a sharp metal slab coming out where used to be the door.

81
00:05:44.280 --> 00:05:46.170
Oh, he caught himself.

82
00:05:47.940 --> 00:05:52.470
My favorite is when it gets real like chilled and like, um,

83
00:05:53.730 --> 00:05:57.980
um, con comfy with it. No, of course.

84
00:05:57.981 --> 00:05:59.300
That's what Pam would've said,

85
00:06:03.080 --> 00:06:07.610
Pam. Uh. I love that.

86
00:06:07.611 --> 00:06:08.444
Guy's voice.

87
00:06:09.170 --> 00:06:13.340
I don't know if it's him or the other forensic file guys. That's the.

88
00:06:14.870 --> 00:06:19.660
How's the forensic guy. Fast guy go again. Uh, there was Oh yeah.

89
00:06:19.661 --> 00:06:22.520
Yeah. That's how it is. Um,

90
00:06:24.200 --> 00:06:28.310
let me just play a little bit. That makes me laugh so hard. That was of course.

91
00:06:28.340 --> 00:06:31.310
W what was the guy's name is the voice, right? Forensic

92
00:06:33.080 --> 00:06:36.650
files, voice the voice,

93
00:06:36.710 --> 00:06:41.030
the voice voice guy.

94
00:06:42.110 --> 00:06:45.080
I mean, you know, Oh, the behind the scenes really

95
00:06:47.230 --> 00:06:50.350
forensic files has always differed from other true crime teams.

96
00:06:51.550 --> 00:06:53.710
Take files as a film.

97
00:06:55.630 --> 00:07:00.100
Once an episode is edited, it's sent to the Los Angeles based music collection.

98
00:07:01.330 --> 00:07:02.590
It's a very different thing.

99
00:07:05.620 --> 00:07:10.450
The music really drives the all right. We know here's the guy, here's the voice.

100
00:07:11.140 --> 00:07:15.670
Hello? It's so time about that. I,

101
00:07:15.700 --> 00:07:18.430
my time in the army, and then I got into radio in 55,

102
00:07:18.431 --> 00:07:22.720
but here you are on the CBS morning show in New York. And it was,

103
00:07:22.810 --> 00:07:24.970
you were doing the land. And that was.

104
00:07:26.170 --> 00:07:29.830
<v 2>And the you'd see the engineer there just before we start put that diamond</v>

105
00:07:29.831 --> 00:07:33.310
cutter on the disc and they would give you the cue. And the,

106
00:07:33.311 --> 00:07:36.730
I remember the orchestra would go for us. A tick tock,

107
00:07:36.820 --> 00:07:40.330
tick tock does the Hamilton watch company and then music.

108
00:07:40.331 --> 00:07:44.560
And I would come on and say, the passage of time is beyond our control,

109
00:07:44.890 --> 00:07:49.420
but it passes beautifully. When a Hamilton and Mark CR, then they would,

110
00:07:49.421 --> 00:07:51.520
the girl was saying, was it a dream? Was it a dream?

111
00:07:52.000 --> 00:07:56.710
<v 0>Did you have time? Oh, this is a tribute.</v>

112
00:07:57.080 --> 00:07:59.950
If you ain't, if you don't have to tribute on honor,

113
00:07:59.951 --> 00:08:02.020
Thomas was born in Pensacola,

114
00:08:02.021 --> 00:08:06.910
Florida on June 28th, 1924. I mean, imagine like,

115
00:08:07.090 --> 00:08:10.240
you know, if you, if you don't have a tribute on YouTube, you ain't.

116
00:08:10.600 --> 00:08:13.690
There's a tribute for everyone. I swear to God, there's a tribute for my maid.

117
00:08:13.691 --> 00:08:15.820
That comes, it'll be like

118
00:08:20.800 --> 00:08:24.190
24, the son of a Welsh minister.

119
00:08:24.370 --> 00:08:27.850
I love who does this voice from them. How to communicate.

120
00:08:27.970 --> 00:08:30.820
He's probably so nervous. Cause he was doing the tribute to the guy. Who's the,

121
00:08:31.060 --> 00:08:31.893
Peter Thomas,

122
00:08:32.350 --> 00:08:36.970
his voice is good too checked and enunciate every night,

123
00:08:36.971 --> 00:08:40.360
growing up, Peter read stories aloud to his family. That's,

124
00:08:40.810 --> 00:08:44.980
which perfected his technique that didn't happen to his father's philosophy.

125
00:08:45.610 --> 00:08:47.470
Words must be visualized,

126
00:08:47.710 --> 00:08:51.250
understood and felt before spoken. Well,

127
00:08:51.251 --> 00:08:52.840
imagine thinking that,

128
00:08:54.670 --> 00:08:57.300
imagine that what a you'd be

129
00:09:00.860 --> 00:09:02.600
succinylcholine.

130
00:09:05.150 --> 00:09:09.680
There were trace amounts of succinylcholine words must be

131
00:09:09.681 --> 00:09:14.390
visualized, understood and felt before spoken.

132
00:09:16.430 --> 00:09:17.263
Pam

133
00:09:18.290 --> 00:09:23.120
words must be visualized or understood and felt before I spoke.

134
00:09:23.121 --> 00:09:28.100
And um, but yeah, it's so crazy though. The lady,

135
00:09:28.101 --> 00:09:32.420
I want to talk about that way too long, but there was a lady, um, that was, um,

136
00:09:34.100 --> 00:09:38.750
there was a lady that, uh, this guy got,

137
00:09:39.740 --> 00:09:43.520
uh, wrongly accused of killing his wife. Imagine you,

138
00:09:43.550 --> 00:09:47.930
your wife gets killed and then you get thrown in jail and you didn't do it.

139
00:09:48.810 --> 00:09:52.670
Are you kidding me, dude? There would nothing would be worse than that.

140
00:09:54.260 --> 00:09:56.270
Like, well of course, nothing will be worse than that,

141
00:09:56.271 --> 00:09:58.790
but like to add insult to injury,

142
00:09:59.870 --> 00:10:04.010
I don't understand how these people like stay on in the courtroom and they're

143
00:10:04.011 --> 00:10:08.090
just like silent dude. Yeah. It'd be like, Hey, you. I didn't do it.

144
00:10:08.091 --> 00:10:11.720
Why is he asking that question? And they'd be like, contempt, contempt, hostile,

145
00:10:11.721 --> 00:10:16.580
witness, hostile a diff whatever the I am person on trial.

146
00:10:16.760 --> 00:10:21.500
I'd be like, dude, I didn't do it. I didn't do it. And they'd be like, well,

147
00:10:21.501 --> 00:10:25.430
this is what she, this is his. He goes crazy. See this one? I'm like, no,

148
00:10:25.431 --> 00:10:28.040
you don't understand, man. There's a real killer out there.

149
00:10:28.130 --> 00:10:32.930
That's getting away with it. I didn't do it. I loved her cases. Open dude,

150
00:10:33.350 --> 00:10:37.610
go find it. I'd be in jail so quick.

151
00:10:37.700 --> 00:10:39.500
Let me tell you that right now my wife died.

152
00:10:39.590 --> 00:10:42.890
I'd be in jail so quick because I would, I would show so much anger.

153
00:10:42.891 --> 00:10:44.630
I'd be like, you're not doing it. Right, dude,

154
00:10:44.930 --> 00:10:48.890
the cops would show up and they'd be like, okay. I was right here, dude.

155
00:10:49.340 --> 00:10:54.020
All right. I wasn't here obviously when she got killed and then now I'm here.

156
00:10:54.080 --> 00:10:59.060
So what's up dude? And they'd be like, Whoa, Whoa, Mr. Dalea Whoa,

157
00:10:59.630 --> 00:11:03.560
did you guys ever fight? And I'd be like, I'm course. We did.

158
00:11:04.520 --> 00:11:09.050
We're married to each other. And they'd be like, dude,

159
00:11:10.970 --> 00:11:14.090
okay, we're going to have to take you in. And they'll be like me.

160
00:11:14.091 --> 00:11:17.750
I didn't do it. Get the real bad guy out there. Coppers.

161
00:11:19.190 --> 00:11:20.330
I'd be in jail. Immediately.

162
00:11:22.910 --> 00:11:25.130
Podcasts about me called the thing about Chris.

163
00:11:26.240 --> 00:11:31.220
The thing about Chris is he got so mad when the police officers

164
00:11:31.221 --> 00:11:35.840
showed up because he thought the cops, Warren doing the job,

165
00:11:36.620 --> 00:11:37.940
Mel naturally,

166
00:11:37.970 --> 00:11:42.350
Chris got a little frustrated and he swung at the cop and the cop

167
00:11:43.850 --> 00:11:44.683
who is

168
00:11:45.890 --> 00:11:50.540
very well-trained duct and then put Chris's arm behind his back,

169
00:11:51.920 --> 00:11:56.050
put the handcuffs. And then Chris went to jail for the rest of his life.

170
00:11:58.260 --> 00:11:59.460
<v 1>Screamed every day.</v>

171
00:12:02.130 --> 00:12:03.060
<v 0>No, that's the thing, dude,</v>

172
00:12:03.420 --> 00:12:06.390
you could kill my wife and I would get blamed for it. No doubt.

173
00:12:06.420 --> 00:12:09.420
There's no doubt. I wouldn't get blamed for it. And I'll never do that.

174
00:12:09.421 --> 00:12:13.710
I would never kill my wife. I would never kill my wife.

175
00:12:21.630 --> 00:12:22.050
<v 1>Anyway.</v>
