00:00:00.060 --> 00:00:02.070
<v 0>When I got to the airport, finally,</v>

2
00:00:03.690 --> 00:00:08.550
this check, this girl who had to be 22,

3
00:00:09.470 --> 00:00:12.590
you know, people come up to me sometimes, whatever I'm ready for it and.

4
00:00:13.340 --> 00:00:16.940
I see them come. I see you coming by the way from like, you're not being sneaky.

5
00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:21.440
You know, people think they're like keto and I, uh,

6
00:00:21.530 --> 00:00:26.240
and the guy and this girl goes like this and I go, Hey.

7
00:00:26.840 --> 00:00:30.620
<v 1>And she says, beer pong. And I go,</v>

8
00:00:31.610 --> 00:00:36.500
well, what the is going to be happening at this point from now on what kind of

9
00:00:36.501 --> 00:00:39.500
reaction am I going to have drum up?

10
00:00:40.820 --> 00:00:45.800
She goes, beer pong. And I, and I say, huh?

11
00:00:47.800 --> 00:00:51.190
And she says, I met you last night during beer pong.

12
00:00:52.030 --> 00:00:56.470
And I say, no, not me. And she says,

13
00:00:56.650 --> 00:00:58.150
yeah, it was you.

14
00:00:59.930 --> 00:01:01.670
And everybody's listening.

15
00:01:02.360 --> 00:01:06.760
And I'm sure some of those people are like this idiot. Got it wrong.

16
00:01:06.760 --> 00:01:09.490
<v 0>She does. Doesn't realize that that's the comedian.</v>

17
00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:13.300
And she maybe recognizes him that way.

18
00:01:13.960 --> 00:01:16.480
<v 1>And is confusing someone else's.</v>

19
00:01:16.990 --> 00:01:19.630
<v 0>Jenky face playing beer pong. Maybe she was drunk.</v>

20
00:01:20.140 --> 00:01:23.650
And now she thinks crystal Chris D'Elia was playing beer pong with her.

21
00:01:24.250 --> 00:01:27.880
<v 1>Bye. By the way, there are some people that think that,</v>

22
00:01:28.960 --> 00:01:33.250
but the people who don't know who I am are looking at me

23
00:01:33.490 --> 00:01:34.870
like, oh,

24
00:01:34.871 --> 00:01:39.850
this guy doesn't want to seem like he was playing beer pong with a 22

25
00:01:39.851 --> 00:01:44.380
year old. So now it looked like a creep.

26
00:01:45.130 --> 00:01:50.020
She goes, beer pong, 22 year old. And I say, ha 39 year old. And she says,

27
00:01:50.560 --> 00:01:55.210
MEChA last night, playing beer pong. And I say, okay, one may. And she says,

28
00:01:55.211 --> 00:01:58.960
yeah, it was dude,

29
00:02:00.280 --> 00:02:05.170
quit blowing my fake cover. It wasn't me. First of all,

30
00:02:07.030 --> 00:02:10.480
I would never play beer pong, dude, if I drank.

31
00:02:10.630 --> 00:02:14.890
<v 0>Uh, first of all, I've never drank period ever. End of story. Full stop.</v>

32
00:02:14.920 --> 00:02:18.180
Do I like when people say that? No, but full stop.

33
00:02:21.060 --> 00:02:25.380
Uh, I I've never drank. Okay. So I know I didn't play beer pong.

34
00:02:25.860 --> 00:02:28.890
I w even if I did, if I drank every day, like a fish,

35
00:02:29.880 --> 00:02:32.760
I would never play beer pong. I, you know why?

36
00:02:32.940 --> 00:02:34.170
Cause I don't need a reason to drink.

37
00:02:34.380 --> 00:02:36.510
<v 1>If I'm going to drink, I'm just going to put the to.</v>

38
00:02:36.510 --> 00:02:39.960
<v 0>My mouth and then ingest it in my body. You're not going to try and get a,</v>

39
00:02:40.260 --> 00:02:42.810
I got to get, I'm going to get harder. Give me all the alcohol,

40
00:02:42.990 --> 00:02:45.150
put it inside me and let me be drunk as.

41
00:02:49.570 --> 00:02:54.480
<v 1>Beer pong. You know, I wouldn't even play ping pong. How about that?</v>

42
00:02:55.080 --> 00:02:59.650
You're gonna give me a paddle. Now this low thing. No way, dude.

43
00:02:59.651 --> 00:03:02.290
The only thing I paddle should be is on,

44
00:03:02.740 --> 00:03:06.070
is connected to a key to get into a gas.

45
00:03:06.370 --> 00:03:09.040
<v 0>Uh, gas, uh, station bathroom.</v>

46
00:03:10.780 --> 00:03:13.000
You ever see the prank on YouTube. I don't know who it is,

47
00:03:13.150 --> 00:03:17.590
but it's some show where they put the keys on funny things in a gas station.

48
00:03:17.980 --> 00:03:21.490
And that one time they, and they kept putting on like big gas things.

49
00:03:21.491 --> 00:03:23.230
And the person had to like bring the big thing.

50
00:03:23.410 --> 00:03:28.270
And the last one was they put the key on a cat and they were like, here you go.

51
00:03:28.271 --> 00:03:31.870
And the guy had to carry the cat to an undo. The key was attached to the cats,

52
00:03:33.100 --> 00:03:37.270
um, color. And he had to undo the thing and then with the cat holding the cat,

53
00:03:37.690 --> 00:03:41.260
man. That was hilarious. But guess what?

54
00:03:41.350 --> 00:03:44.920
It still wasn't as funny as Brian, Callan's Instagram where he says,

55
00:03:45.010 --> 00:03:49.240
I'm the man dragon dude. I did that. I put the, I put that up last night. Holy,

56
00:03:49.840 --> 00:03:52.300
man. Let's play it.

57
00:03:52.540 --> 00:03:56.650
Cause that Brian Callan is the biggest idiot of all time.

58
00:03:57.220 --> 00:04:01.480
I can't even believe this moron, dude. Let's go to his thing.

59
00:04:04.090 --> 00:04:07.510
Okay. Like, let me just hear it. Is

60
00:04:10.060 --> 00:04:12.400
this okay? So

61
00:04:16.270 --> 00:04:17.800
I was eating with my buddies. All right.

62
00:04:18.910 --> 00:04:22.060
And Brian Collins shows up and we're all eating together. And then he leaves,

63
00:04:22.870 --> 00:04:26.350
oh, we all leave. Right. And we're all laughing outside of the diner as we do.

64
00:04:26.380 --> 00:04:29.860
We laugh outside of the diner because once you eat and you're done,

65
00:04:30.190 --> 00:04:31.023
it's not over.

66
00:04:31.600 --> 00:04:35.860
The fat lady hasn't sung yet you go outside and you th you know,

67
00:04:35.861 --> 00:04:36.694
you do the thing, right?

68
00:04:37.260 --> 00:04:39.180
<v 2>Oh man, uh, you.</v>

69
00:04:39.180 --> 00:04:43.650
<v 1>Do that. Yeah, dude, because I'm almost 40. You do that. You go, oh, uh, some.</v>

70
00:04:43.980 --> 00:04:48.010
<v 0>Gets a toothpick. Cause he thinks he needs it. You know? And.</v>

71
00:04:48.150 --> 00:04:51.240
<v 2>Oh man. So, and somebody says like, Hey, by the way,</v>

72
00:04:52.650 --> 00:04:56.190
and it goes like, nah, nah, you do that. You know? And he goes, ah.

73
00:04:56.430 --> 00:05:00.510
That's hilarious. [inaudible] I don't know, man. Yeah.

74
00:05:01.540 --> 00:05:02.373
And I was.

75
00:05:02.400 --> 00:05:03.360
<v 0>In there, you know?</v>

76
00:05:04.650 --> 00:05:07.620
And so Kalin leaves because he likes to be,

77
00:05:07.670 --> 00:05:09.750
he loves to pretend like he has to do at 3:00 AM.

78
00:05:09.780 --> 00:05:12.300
Even though he doesn't and he leaves and he gets, goes,

79
00:05:12.301 --> 00:05:16.710
walks over to his car and this happens. Okay,

80
00:05:18.750 --> 00:05:21.750
let me just pull it up again so I can play it from,

81
00:05:21.950 --> 00:05:23.670
from the beginning of this happens. So he's far away.

82
00:05:23.730 --> 00:05:26.160
Me and my other two buddies, the Irish guy and Craig.

83
00:05:27.600 --> 00:05:31.560
<v 3>Yo, Hey, that's me obviously.</v>

84
00:05:32.400 --> 00:05:37.230
What's up Brian? Good luck guys. You're a. Huh?

85
00:05:37.950 --> 00:05:42.750
Huh? You're a. Hey bro, stay there. I'm going to tell you. Okay.

86
00:05:42.810 --> 00:05:46.500
<v 0>So he's far away now. He drives over his car is silent.</v>

87
00:05:47.730 --> 00:05:51.330
His Tesla rolls over like it's a kitty cat. Okay. Pulls up.

88
00:05:51.990 --> 00:05:52.950
I'm shooting and I'm good.

89
00:05:53.460 --> 00:05:56.810
<v 3>Bro. Yeah. Tonight my comedy. This is what I do.</v>

90
00:05:57.350 --> 00:06:00.200
Crowd's ready that you know why they call me the man dragons.

91
00:06:11.270 --> 00:06:12.103
[inaudible].

92
00:06:16.590 --> 00:06:19.670
<v 0>One does this, you turn illegally,</v>

93
00:06:21.500 --> 00:06:25.730
drives away, zips by and then has to stop at a red light.

94
00:06:26.930 --> 00:06:27.763
<v 1>Dude.</v>

95
00:06:29.250 --> 00:06:30.510
<v 0>Let me tell you something right now.</v>

96
00:06:30.870 --> 00:06:34.200
There's nothing that's ever been funnier than that. Okay. He's 52

97
00:06:36.770 --> 00:06:38.120

98
00:06:40.150 --> 00:06:43.570
go to my Instagram page and you can see it. It's the last thing I posted.

99
00:06:44.980 --> 00:06:49.270
<v 1>He just goes one. That one. God.</v>

100
00:06:49.720 --> 00:06:50.470
He's funny, man.
