00:00:01.080 --> 00:00:01.980
<v 0>I love Jay Z.</v>

2
00:00:02.130 --> 00:00:05.880
We'll get so specific that you think he's actually stopped recording and like

3
00:00:05.881 --> 00:00:10.650
some real is going on. Thanksgiving tend to get out dishes. Oh wait. Oh. Stop.

4
00:00:10.680 --> 00:00:15.530
Oh, wait. No, you're wrapping. Okay, cool. Oh yeah.

5
00:00:15.920 --> 00:00:18.830
I can't say the N word, so, Oh yeah.

6
00:00:19.160 --> 00:00:21.440
These bleep is coming. Get out.

7
00:00:21.441 --> 00:00:25.220
You could dishes or something like is Thanksgiving, first of all. No, for sure.

8
00:00:26.030 --> 00:00:28.370
Get out your good dishes or something so secure.

9
00:00:31.910 --> 00:00:35.690
I mean then the next night is, and none other than that are,

10
00:00:35.691 --> 00:00:39.740
and without further ado, I like like Freddy, get ready.

11
00:00:39.741 --> 00:00:43.910
It's I mean just and okay. Whatever, but you know,

12
00:00:44.290 --> 00:00:47.480
don't need to go all into that really, but, so

13
00:00:49.880 --> 00:00:52.010
he's. He's making to attacking document parking lot

14
00:00:55.640 --> 00:00:58.880
here. JZ send security. Laughs.

15
00:00:59.360 --> 00:01:03.320
Got to duck into the parking lot. Hove,

16
00:01:04.490 --> 00:01:08.570
I guess hope, I guess. Did you see the video of Beyonce?

17
00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:15.550
just straight up molding that girl who was trying to talk to

18
00:01:15.740 --> 00:01:18.200
her, Jay Z and lean over Beyonce.

19
00:01:19.130 --> 00:01:23.450
And the girl was like at the basketball game and she was one of the Clippers

20
00:01:23.451 --> 00:01:25.580
owners or Lakers owners or whatever the who cares.

21
00:01:25.850 --> 00:01:27.290
One of the golden state warriors owners.

22
00:01:28.550 --> 00:01:33.320
And she leaned over and she was like talking to Jay Z and she leaned

23
00:01:33.321 --> 00:01:38.300
over, um, Jay Z or uh,

24
00:01:38.570 --> 00:01:42.860
Beyonce and Beyonce kind of like shifted. So she wouldn't do it.

25
00:01:43.550 --> 00:01:47.870
And now here's what the annoying people are saying. Oh yeah.

26
00:01:48.140 --> 00:01:51.680
Beyonce. Didn't like how she was talking to her man. No,

27
00:01:51.800 --> 00:01:52.880
it's not that the lady was,

28
00:01:52.970 --> 00:01:56.930
it's just leaning over too much and that's annoying a little bit.

29
00:01:56.931 --> 00:02:01.820
Sometimes also there's probably that whole thing where even though

30
00:02:01.821 --> 00:02:06.710
she was like, uh, one of the, um, golden state warriors owners' wives, it was,

31
00:02:06.860 --> 00:02:08.120
it still was like, you know,

32
00:02:09.350 --> 00:02:13.340
still like where it was like a don't act like,

33
00:02:13.341 --> 00:02:16.010
you know us dude, you're not with us. You know?

34
00:02:16.910 --> 00:02:19.390
So JZ was talking back all cool and, and be outside,

35
00:02:19.391 --> 00:02:22.550
just kind of gave a little bit of a look that was nothing.

36
00:02:22.551 --> 00:02:26.030
But then the beehive, as they say,

37
00:02:26.780 --> 00:02:31.400
we're giving her death threats. Hey chill, Hey Beyonce,

38
00:02:31.401 --> 00:02:34.100
fans chill. Hey,

39
00:02:34.430 --> 00:02:38.840
also you call yourself the beehive, you know, in

40
00:02:40.850 --> 00:02:44.450
non-ironic terms, look at her, just,

41
00:02:45.800 --> 00:02:46.940
she obviously just kind of is like,

42
00:02:46.941 --> 00:02:50.570
what's up with this lady and then just kind of shucks are a little bit it's

43
00:02:50.840 --> 00:02:53.570
kinda cool, dude. Cause the lady was just like leaning away too far over,

44
00:02:53.571 --> 00:02:57.350
but who cares? See that's the thing. Hey, what are you doing?

45
00:02:57.410 --> 00:03:00.610
That's what you gotta do. Don't shuck. She's Beyonce. She can't get,

46
00:03:00.860 --> 00:03:05.200
get crazy with it. I was thinking about this. Like I was thinking about this.

47
00:03:06.220 --> 00:03:09.550
Um, I don't remember what the example was, but

48
00:03:11.080 --> 00:03:15.850
man, imagine being so famous because you could only be so famous if you're like,

49
00:03:16.930 --> 00:03:18.940
if you don't say crazy, up.

50
00:03:20.020 --> 00:03:22.000
And then if you do,

51
00:03:24.130 --> 00:03:26.900
it's because you're famous because of that, there's,

52
00:03:26.901 --> 00:03:30.310
there's different levels of it, but it's like, um,

53
00:03:31.360 --> 00:03:36.310
you can get as famous as like Dennis Rodman was a lot of young

54
00:03:36.311 --> 00:03:38.890
people probably don't know who they, who they, who he is,

55
00:03:39.130 --> 00:03:41.560
but he was a basketball player that was like fake, crazy,

56
00:03:41.620 --> 00:03:46.390
famous for being crazy. You can get that famous, but

57
00:03:48.190 --> 00:03:50.020
uh, you can,

58
00:03:50.200 --> 00:03:53.890
then you can only if you're already really famous, he turned us off.

59
00:03:54.340 --> 00:03:57.250
There's if you're already really famous, you can't get,

60
00:03:58.810 --> 00:04:02.650
and then you start doing crazy. Like, um, like Charlie sheen,

61
00:04:03.870 --> 00:04:08.520
you can't sustain that bother me.

62
00:04:08.910 --> 00:04:11.700
You can't sustain that for a long, too long.

63
00:04:11.730 --> 00:04:15.750
Like when Charlie sheen was like tiger blood and winning,

64
00:04:15.780 --> 00:04:18.420
like that only lasts as long as it can.

65
00:04:18.421 --> 00:04:21.180
And then it blows over because he wasn't famous for being crazy.

66
00:04:21.180 --> 00:04:24.780
He was famous for being a famous actor war.

67
00:04:24.781 --> 00:04:28.020
You can be the most like crazy famous,

68
00:04:28.080 --> 00:04:32.760
but then you can't say anything like counter Reeves or Tom cruise

69
00:04:32.761 --> 00:04:34.320
or Harrison Ford.

70
00:04:35.700 --> 00:04:39.390
Like if all of a sudden Harrison Ford put out a video that was like,

71
00:04:40.890 --> 00:04:44.430
you know, if Harrison Ford, all of a sudden put out a video,

72
00:04:44.850 --> 00:04:49.800
like how my video was making fun of Armenians last week have Harrison

73
00:04:49.801 --> 00:04:54.060
Ford was like, how come Armenia is like, love to say like,

74
00:04:55.230 --> 00:04:57.570
Hey, don't disrespect me. People will be like, Oh,

75
00:04:57.600 --> 00:05:00.240
Harrison Ford is what the is.

76
00:05:00.990 --> 00:05:03.930
People be like Harrison Ford for saying the. So like,

77
00:05:03.931 --> 00:05:07.950
that would be my nightmare to be maybe Harrison. Ford's not the best example.

78
00:05:07.951 --> 00:05:12.620
But to be like that famous to where you can't say the like,

79
00:05:12.720 --> 00:05:15.960
like Jennifer Garner, like if she just said that people would be like, Oh,

80
00:05:15.961 --> 00:05:19.140
she lost her mind, dude.

81
00:05:20.370 --> 00:05:22.250
I that's to not be like that.

82
00:05:22.270 --> 00:05:25.440
Not be able to say what you want to me.

83
00:05:27.120 --> 00:05:31.230
That's crazy. That's so insane that that would be the worst for me.

84
00:05:31.980 --> 00:05:34.530
And I realize I'll never, you know, be that,

85
00:05:36.300 --> 00:05:40.410
the only way I could get there to get as famous that famous is to be because of

86
00:05:40.411 --> 00:05:45.390
I'm an insane person, you know, like it to be a literal.

87
00:05:45.840 --> 00:05:48.810
Like if I did, if I had like a, it was a serial killer,

88
00:05:49.260 --> 00:05:51.240
then that would only add to it and you'd be like, wow,

89
00:05:51.241 --> 00:05:53.370
this crazy comedian who had a podcast.

90
00:05:53.371 --> 00:05:56.520
And just talking about how he made a cult, literally started killing people,

91
00:05:57.680 --> 00:06:02.540
literally started killing businessmen and killed 12

92
00:06:02.541 --> 00:06:06.680
businessmen. If I was going to kill people though,

93
00:06:06.681 --> 00:06:10.700
it will be businessmen in suits, straight up, not if they,

94
00:06:10.850 --> 00:06:12.800
if they got out of their suit and I had the knife ready and they were like,

95
00:06:12.860 --> 00:06:17.020
Oh the guy other. I'm not doing it. We'll be like live tonight at 11,

96
00:06:17.021 --> 00:06:18.790
talking about comedian crystal

97
00:06:22.660 --> 00:06:26.380
live at 11. We have to be talking about Chris meat. They wouldn't even,

98
00:06:26.410 --> 00:06:29.920
they would disrespect me by having new new news at 3:00 AM that nobody listened

99
00:06:29.921 --> 00:06:32.290
to. We live it's 3:00 AM.

100
00:06:32.291 --> 00:06:35.800
We're talking about the comedian turned serial killer.

101
00:06:36.340 --> 00:06:41.290
Chris D'Elia once had a spat with Albuquerque and now has killed

102
00:06:41.530 --> 00:06:46.360
at least 13 businessmen with suits on,

103
00:06:48.590 --> 00:06:51.640
uh, I would give all the interviews too. I did too, dude.

104
00:06:51.641 --> 00:06:55.480
I keep my phone up my butt, go to jail and do live videos after that.

105
00:06:55.720 --> 00:07:00.670
And you'd see all over the lens. It's gross at gross,

106
00:07:00.700 --> 00:07:01.780
but that's why you're hearing my babies.
