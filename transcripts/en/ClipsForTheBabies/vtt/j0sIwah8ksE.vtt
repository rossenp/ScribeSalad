00:00:00.840 --> 00:00:04.980
<v 0>Dude. I, I mean, I'm just done with the internet, by the way. I've tweeted. I,</v>

2
00:00:04.990 --> 00:00:08.490
you know, sometimes I tweet, people get off. It's just getting worse and worse.

3
00:00:09.240 --> 00:00:14.010
Sometimes I just tweet. And I'm like the other day I tweeted on Twitter,

4
00:00:14.760 --> 00:00:17.340
they were like, oh, the, the women's, um,

5
00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:21.360
it's the first time WWE is headlining. Uh,

6
00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:26.280
women are headlining and, uh, eh,

7
00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:31.250
the WWE whatever it is, what is it? Even? It,

8
00:00:31.251 --> 00:00:35.700
it was the, uh, the wa yeah,

9
00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:40.470
WWE first time. Uh, here it is breaking WrestleMania.

10
00:00:40.471 --> 00:00:44.730
35 will feature the first ever women's main event when Ronda Rousey,

11
00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:48.870
Becky Lynch and Ms. Charlotte battle for the raw women's championship.

12
00:00:48.900 --> 00:00:52.830
And I just tweeted on top of it, retweeted it and wrote still fake though.

13
00:00:54.750 --> 00:00:55.583
And like

14
00:00:57.120 --> 00:01:01.350
the amount of people that were just like

15
00:01:02.220 --> 00:01:07.050
you mother, like,

16
00:01:07.600 --> 00:01:09.420
dude, it is fake.

17
00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:15.750
It is fake. It's not real.

18
00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:20.550
It's literally like saying the sky is blue. So these people are like,

19
00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:23.700
so is every TV show and movie ever. Well,

20
00:01:23.701 --> 00:01:27.630
why don't you say when movies are fake? Why don't you say I don't,

21
00:01:27.870 --> 00:01:31.650
but you know what, if you did, I wouldn't give a

22
00:01:35.370 --> 00:01:39.570
if someone's going to say, Hey, yeah, but you know, Austin Powers is fake.

23
00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:41.310
I, okay.

24
00:01:41.730 --> 00:01:45.840
<v 1>Yeah. Cool. Who gives.</v>

25
00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:46.673
<v 0>A?</v>

26
00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:52.050
You know why you're so sensitive wrestling fans turn me up in the headphones.

27
00:01:52.350 --> 00:01:56.520
You know why you're so sensitive fans about wrestling.

28
00:01:56.850 --> 00:02:00.990
When people say that it's fake because you are

29
00:02:00.991 --> 00:02:04.260
pretending it's real. That's why,

30
00:02:04.980 --> 00:02:08.040
so what if it's fake? So what movies are fake,

31
00:02:08.610 --> 00:02:11.340
but nobody's giving a.

32
00:02:16.520 --> 00:02:20.570
They get so bent up because they know, by the way they know it's silly.

33
00:02:20.630 --> 00:02:22.190
That's why they bend. They get bent up.

34
00:02:22.580 --> 00:02:26.750
Cause they know it's silly because they're 40 year olds wearing

35
00:02:26.751 --> 00:02:27.800
spandex

36
00:02:29.510 --> 00:02:32.420
with hair that looks like it should be on Axl rose.

37
00:02:33.170 --> 00:02:35.720
And they know that it's silly.

38
00:02:37.520 --> 00:02:41.370
If you don't look, you can be a fan of wrestling. It's not,

39
00:02:41.570 --> 00:02:46.430
I don't even hate it. It's I, I, you know, it's a. It's a spectacle.

40
00:02:46.431 --> 00:02:49.910
It's not hurting anybody. It's fine. I don't give a. I don't. I tell you what,

41
00:02:49.911 --> 00:02:52.190
I'd rather watch wrestling than football,

42
00:02:54.170 --> 00:02:58.910
but it is fake. So if you're going to say, oh

43
00:03:01.930 --> 00:03:06.760
you, you don't. Yeah, but you don't say movies are fake. No, I mean,

44
00:03:06.761 --> 00:03:10.900
I, I, I would say movies are fake. I just did it. And,

45
00:03:10.980 --> 00:03:14.650
and if somebody did, I would give a.

46
00:03:17.830 --> 00:03:22.090
So if you're telling me, I mean, dude, this guy,

47
00:03:22.990 --> 00:03:24.970
I don't even know. There's so many of these people

48
00:03:30.330 --> 00:03:33.840
so wrote. So is every TV show and movie ever. And I wrote, you've seen cops.

49
00:03:39.150 --> 00:03:43.560
Why? Why do wrestling fans get mad when you say it's fake?

50
00:03:44.340 --> 00:03:47.880
Because they've heard it a bunch of before. Okay. Because you know,

51
00:03:48.060 --> 00:03:49.350
it's silly.

52
00:03:49.920 --> 00:03:54.840
There are a bunch of hairband looking beefcakes with

53
00:03:54.841 --> 00:03:59.430
white boots on putting faces in nuts.

54
00:04:00.240 --> 00:04:03.540
That's what it is. And the announcement.

55
00:04:03.900 --> 00:04:07.990
<v 1>Oh, oh, oh,</v>

56
00:04:08.070 --> 00:04:10.770
watch out. No, no. Watch out.

57
00:04:15.390 --> 00:04:19.470
Oh, here he comes. He's up on the ropes. Oh,

58
00:04:20.910 --> 00:04:24.000
what saw fake.

59
00:04:28.410 --> 00:04:31.740
Oh, how's he going to get up from that? I know how.

60
00:04:39.780 --> 00:04:44.130
<v 0>Somebody wrote. Just because it's a watch.</v>

61
00:04:44.131 --> 00:04:47.850
Somebody wrote like, dude, somebody wrote crystal, Leah, that guy.

62
00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:52.260
And I looked at his whole profile was like wrestlers

63
00:04:54.330 --> 00:04:58.200
and like masks and. Like, dude,

64
00:04:58.770 --> 00:05:02.820
get bent. Like what?

65
00:05:03.060 --> 00:05:06.540
W Y w I'm not even hating on it. That's the thing.

66
00:05:06.600 --> 00:05:10.920
People just assume that that's my whole thing. That's what, when I talk about,

67
00:05:10.921 --> 00:05:12.450
like I say like, well,

68
00:05:12.451 --> 00:05:15.210
I'm going to tweet whatever people are going to take it the wrong way.

69
00:05:15.211 --> 00:05:17.580
No matter what this whole,

70
00:05:19.800 --> 00:05:23.340
this whole culture of, oh, they're done. What'd you say? What'd you say,

71
00:05:23.520 --> 00:05:28.230
what'd you say done? What'd you say? That's what you said done. You hate rests.

72
00:05:28.470 --> 00:05:33.360
You said wrestling's fake. I'm not disagreeing with somebody.

73
00:05:33.570 --> 00:05:37.110
And this is not the Barbara Streisand thing. This is the wrestling thing. If,

74
00:05:37.111 --> 00:05:41.190
if you're a wrestling fan and you heard me say,

75
00:05:41.370 --> 00:05:44.250
and this is just the example I'm using, I just, because it's me.

76
00:05:44.310 --> 00:05:47.760
And it happened to me. And it's the most recent one.

77
00:05:47.940 --> 00:05:52.710
But if you're a wrestling fan and you're upset with me or a comedian saying,

78
00:05:52.711 --> 00:05:56.580
yeah, but wrestling's fake though. And then you think, well, I can't him.

79
00:05:56.640 --> 00:06:01.450
I'm not going be, Hey dude, Europe. Hmm.

80
00:06:04.390 --> 00:06:09.130
Sat noise. Your sat noise. You're making, is this, is it sloshy?

81
00:06:09.760 --> 00:06:13.090
Cause Europe don't, you know,

82
00:06:13.570 --> 00:06:16.840
cause someone disagrees with you comedically, by the way,

83
00:06:17.260 --> 00:06:21.040
you can't be their fan. I hear sloshing.

84
00:06:24.040 --> 00:06:24.040
Yeah.
