00:00:00.660 --> 00:00:04.440
<v 0>Craigslist misconnections. Here we go.</v>

2
00:00:06.990 --> 00:00:09.960
Where are we doing it? Carlsbad. San Diego.

3
00:00:11.940 --> 00:00:15.870
You didn't mean to send it to me? Well, he did. And I'm. Um, here we go.

4
00:00:18.420 --> 00:00:21.990
<v 1>This, you were picking up Rubio's to go in Carlsbad.</v>

5
00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:24.840
<v 0>Oh, Rubio's to go in Carlsbad.</v>

6
00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:30.600
You were an attractive black guy with athletic clothes on grabbing food to go

7
00:00:31.200 --> 00:00:33.390
that Rubio's on El Camino rail.

8
00:00:35.330 --> 00:00:38.150
I was the tall blonde getting salsa.

9
00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:45.800
Uh that's how somehow the grossest one I've ever read just some

10
00:00:46.220 --> 00:00:51.080
tall chick scooping up salsa, looking at some athletic, some,

11
00:00:51.110 --> 00:00:56.040
some black guy in like Adidas do not contact me once.

12
00:00:56.100 --> 00:00:59.550
So this is services offers. Yes. It's pretty, pretty specific. Do it.

13
00:01:01.960 --> 00:01:05.800
That's so funny. Cause like she thinks that maybe he would have been like,

14
00:01:06.700 --> 00:01:08.860
oh yeah, I saw this girl getting salsa.

15
00:01:10.870 --> 00:01:13.780
Like just guys don't notice that the girl's getting salsa.

16
00:01:13.781 --> 00:01:15.070
If he's attracted to her, you know,

17
00:01:15.580 --> 00:01:19.690
just say saw yet rodeos that any guy at rodeos would be like, oh,

18
00:01:19.840 --> 00:01:24.550
it's probably me. Oh, it's probably me. Yeah. I was getting salsa. Oh,

19
00:01:24.551 --> 00:01:28.810
I don't give a. You have a. I was getting salsa though. Oh, the one with the.

20
00:01:31.720 --> 00:01:34.750
Yeah, no, I was near the guacamole. Oh, you got a mouth and stuff?

21
00:01:39.930 --> 00:01:42.240
Uh, let's do another one.

22
00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:48.510
This is the most confusing. Whenever it's four words long,

23
00:01:49.290 --> 00:01:53.160
the title is two words. Lasting batteries.

24
00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:57.900
K. The body is very bored.

25
00:01:59.580 --> 00:02:03.420
K did not contact me on solicitors.

26
00:02:03.480 --> 00:02:07.380
<v 1>Well, what's the solicited offer. What's the,</v>

27
00:02:07.740 --> 00:02:11.550
what do you mean do not contact me? Unsolicited offers. You're bored.

28
00:02:12.870 --> 00:02:17.100
What's the thing you're supposed to get solicited with. Think before.

29
00:02:17.100 --> 00:02:21.330
<v 0>You get on Craigslist list in San Diego, AKA the worst place of all time.</v>

30
00:02:23.580 --> 00:02:28.410
I'd rather get run over by a Zamboni than be in San Diego. Here's another one.

31
00:02:29.730 --> 00:02:33.180
Asian woman, not sure. A racist.

32
00:02:35.670 --> 00:02:39.990
You were dancing with your kids, son and daughter in the garage. Creep.

33
00:02:42.150 --> 00:02:46.110
You seem like someone fun to hang out with. I left early,

34
00:02:46.111 --> 00:02:48.750
but hope you see this and say, hi, what do you mean left early?

35
00:02:50.550 --> 00:02:51.810
You shouldn't have been there.

36
00:02:51.810 --> 00:02:55.110
<v 1>Period. Hey, I meant to creep on you for longer, but.</v>

37
00:02:56.340 --> 00:03:01.180
<v 0>I had to go. I was scheduled look at someone else in the garage.</v>

38
00:03:02.140 --> 00:03:05.560
<v 1>I was, I was scheduled to wash. I was scheduled to watch,</v>

39
00:03:05.590 --> 00:03:07.960
I think some middle Eastern.

40
00:03:08.080 --> 00:03:12.760
<v 0>Lady, maybe shower through a curtain. I was,</v>

41
00:03:12.820 --> 00:03:17.470
I was booked. I was busy.

42
00:03:19.760 --> 00:03:22.910
I left early. I could, sorry. I can only stay 45 minutes.

43
00:03:22.911 --> 00:03:26.900
Watch you dance with your sons in the garage. Wow, dude,

44
00:03:27.890 --> 00:03:29.600

00:03:39.050 --> 00:03:39.680

<v 1>No burgers at Del taco.</v>

00:04:13.850 --> 00:04:17.030
No burgers at Del taco. If you put a burger in your mouth

56

at burgers, in your, in your mouth and they'll pick up

57
00:04:27.820 --> 00:04:28.930
