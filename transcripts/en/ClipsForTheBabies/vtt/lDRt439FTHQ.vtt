00:00:00.960 --> 00:00:02.520
<v 0>A lot of people don't know what's the means,</v>

2
00:00:02.850 --> 00:00:05.790
but this is a good one page at legs for days,

3
00:00:07.020 --> 00:00:08.550
I guess change it probably cause that's

4
00:00:10.140 --> 00:00:14.220
how is it to be the first person scooting in a corner booth at a restaurant?

5
00:00:14.490 --> 00:00:16.980
Yeah. Yeah, because you gotta be like,

6
00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:21.990
use your palms and scoot. Yeah. It's pretty boot boot.

7
00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:25.080
It's pretty. It's pretty boot. It's pretty. Um,

8
00:00:25.081 --> 00:00:30.030
especially if you're like a white guy that is wearing shorts,

9
00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:34.770
you're a major. If you do that, white guys have the most, some,

10
00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:40.400
um, what do you call it? Uh, um,

11
00:00:41.510 --> 00:00:43.790
well, what's the, what's the word? It's a very easy word

12
00:00:47.270 --> 00:00:51.350
where you can, what's the word where you can. Wow.

13
00:00:51.351 --> 00:00:54.140
I can't even think of how to describe this word, but it's a very easy word.

14
00:00:54.141 --> 00:00:58.400
Hold on. I got a second babies. If it come through, uh,

15
00:00:59.990 --> 00:01:02.240
Oh geez. Jesus Christ. What a brain. Hold on.

16
00:01:02.510 --> 00:01:06.680
This is not happening in a long time. Uh, potential. Wow.

17
00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:09.530
Jesus. Yeah.

18
00:01:09.531 --> 00:01:14.150
The most high some potential white guys are shorts and blonde hair for sure. Um,

19
00:01:14.210 --> 00:01:18.560
okay, let's go to another one. Crystal. Leah, would you rather, okay.

20
00:01:18.940 --> 00:01:21.740
Meghilla Megalodon at Megan underscore Sullivan.

21
00:01:22.010 --> 00:01:25.730
Would you rather ride in this car or fly United? She knows.

22
00:01:25.731 --> 00:01:30.470
I hate United because United sucks. They're run by cats. This is a,

23
00:01:34.310 --> 00:01:39.080
Oh my we'll put the picture up. I mean, dude,

24
00:01:39.110 --> 00:01:42.560
this truck, first of all, it's neon green with,

25
00:01:43.820 --> 00:01:48.020
what are those snake eyes on the back that are the blinkers?

26
00:01:52.910 --> 00:01:56.810
No, it's not Spiderman, but they do have ghost rider on the back window.

27
00:01:58.340 --> 00:02:03.230
And just these decals on it. Love is lame on the top. K.

28
00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:08.330
So deeper a holler for a dollar choke

29
00:02:08.331 --> 00:02:13.010
hard. Just like, okay, well not necessarily. Oh my God, dude.

30
00:02:13.070 --> 00:02:15.590
There's the hello? Kitty thing. And instead of the eyes,

31
00:02:15.591 --> 00:02:19.880
it has boobs and it says, Hey guy,

32
00:02:20.870 --> 00:02:23.210
you're a man. Cause you have your license. What are you doing?

33
00:02:24.680 --> 00:02:28.490
I like girls that drink beer. S racists are a rapist.

34
00:02:29.240 --> 00:02:32.930
My other ride is my sexy girlfriend. S a sexist.

35
00:02:33.740 --> 00:02:38.240
I like to spoon, but I love to fork. I mean, dude, you don't,

36
00:02:38.270 --> 00:02:43.250
you might as well put, right? Because you already put, Oh my God,

37
00:02:43.251 --> 00:02:47.960
dude. The other vagina.

38
00:02:50.660 --> 00:02:55.100
Oh my God, dude. It says real women's swallow, bro.

39
00:02:57.110 --> 00:03:01.120
Imagine driving around in this. I love that edge

40
00:03:02.890 --> 00:03:05.260
boobies. We stare because we care

41
00:03:07.120 --> 00:03:10.600
ill for skin holds germs just for why to get medical.

42
00:03:14.220 --> 00:03:15.600
<v 1>Oh my God, dude.</v>

43
00:03:17.040 --> 00:03:20.160
<v 0>I hate smelly. VADs just on the back of his car.</v>

44
00:03:24.930 --> 00:03:28.620
<v 1>Oh, and the license plate is iMeet wagon</v>

45
00:03:30.960 --> 00:03:31.793
meet w.

46
00:03:32.100 --> 00:03:34.170
<v 0>UGM, Pennsylvania,</v>

47
00:03:37.170 --> 00:03:41.100
real men don't buy girls. I see the short bus is missing a passenger.

48
00:03:41.101 --> 00:03:45.810
I mean this whole thing is the most offensive back of a car ever.

49
00:03:46.500 --> 00:03:50.490
Uranus is huge. K not so not funny,

50
00:03:50.970 --> 00:03:55.740
just so not funny to do the planet thing with the making it like it's an.

51
00:03:57.420 --> 00:04:02.310
And then on the upper left of the back truck

52
00:04:02.940 --> 00:04:03.630
back of the truck,

53
00:04:03.630 --> 00:04:08.610
it says protected by acid spitting kittens for no reason.

54
00:04:09.420 --> 00:04:13.500
No, it's not. And just ghost rider on the back, you know,

55
00:04:14.520 --> 00:04:18.540
just like so offensive and then just go Strider.

56
00:04:20.340 --> 00:04:24.480
Hello. You know? Oh my God.

57
00:04:24.510 --> 00:04:28.440
I like to snap. I've never heard how bad the,

58
00:04:28.830 --> 00:04:31.680
I like to snatch kisses and vice versa.

59
00:04:33.930 --> 00:04:36.690
One thing you know about this guy is that he's white.

60
00:04:37.950 --> 00:04:41.610
I mean any Asian or black or any

61
00:04:42.900 --> 00:04:45.180
Asian guys would look at this car and be like this

62
00:04:47.700 --> 00:04:52.340
and black guys would look at the car like this. They would have the, like the,

63
00:04:52.370 --> 00:04:56.700
like that meme of the they'd be like, they'd have that look.

64
00:04:57.330 --> 00:04:59.670
And Persian guys would watch this car and be like this.

65
00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:03.030
<v 1>Oh, Oh, what?</v>

66
00:05:05.460 --> 00:05:08.040
You don't know? I mean the.

67
00:05:08.250 --> 00:05:12.690
<v 0>The only person that would be like, Oh,</v>

68
00:05:12.840 --> 00:05:16.680
that's pretty funny. It would be like a white guy, you know?

69
00:05:17.910 --> 00:05:22.410
<v 1>Oh. Oh, Hey,</v>

70
00:05:22.710 --> 00:05:25.590
Hey. And they would call purchase would be like, Hey, check this fool out.

71
00:05:25.591 --> 00:05:29.010
Look at this. What the bro? And Nima watt

72
00:05:30.900 --> 00:05:32.520
or a mirror look what the.

73
00:05:32.880 --> 00:05:36.330
<v 0>Bro? It says, I like, I like girls that drink beer dog. You can't.</v>

74
00:05:37.710 --> 00:05:40.850
Oh. Hey,

75
00:05:41.190 --> 00:05:43.800
imagine you're driving behind this guy and you see,

76
00:05:43.801 --> 00:05:47.910
watch out the idiot behind me decal on there. You're busting him up or what

77
00:05:50.400 --> 00:05:54.690
dude, ghost rider. That kills me. That ghost riders on it.

78
00:05:55.800 --> 00:06:00.530
What not nice fart can

79
00:06:01.010 --> 00:06:05.540
Oh, like a butt. Nice fart. Can it says, wow. This guy is for sure.

80
00:06:05.541 --> 00:06:07.100
White and definitely has a beard.

81
00:06:07.910 --> 00:06:09.770
There's no way this guy's like a clean cart guy.

82
00:06:13.420 --> 00:06:15.820
Well, I love thinking about a Persian guy looking at this car.

83
00:06:16.900 --> 00:06:20.740
<v 1>Oh, Hey. How much would you, Hey, how much,</v>

84
00:06:20.890 --> 00:06:22.570
how much would you have to pay.

85
00:06:22.720 --> 00:06:26.860
<v 0>You drive around in that, that sort of purging? I would say. Um, all right.</v>

86
00:06:27.250 --> 00:06:30.250
Next one, I guess. Would you ride in this car or fly United? I mean, Hey,

87
00:06:30.820 --> 00:06:34.630
fly United, but never be in that car, dude.

88
00:06:37.510 --> 00:06:41.860
Oh, here's a good one. Roberto. Rob Herrera Jr. LOL. Why do you always say,

89
00:06:42.490 --> 00:06:46.540
well, he meant as they say, but he didn't left out a word cause right into fast.

90
00:06:46.570 --> 00:06:50.440
Got real excited. Why do you always say my opener instead of their actual name?

91
00:06:50.470 --> 00:06:53.590
Because, because that's what they deserve, dude.

92
00:06:54.880 --> 00:06:56.740
He's got the best job in comedy, man.

93
00:06:56.741 --> 00:07:01.480
He goes out there does some makes thousands of dollars selling his merch

94
00:07:01.840 --> 00:07:06.160
and he, I also don't always say it, but cause it's funny,

95
00:07:06.161 --> 00:07:09.040
it's a joke because sway deserves.

96
00:07:11.290 --> 00:07:16.030
Um, and then after that he did a follow-up tweet that says, say Christ.

97
00:07:17.320 --> 00:07:20.890
Um, yeah. So that's it. Uh, that's what I do. That's why I do that.

98
00:07:20.891 --> 00:07:22.990
And that's what I do. And that's it. That's it for the episode.
