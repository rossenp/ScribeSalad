00:00:00.660 --> 00:00:05.520
<v 0>Cause people are like talking about how like, cause I guess Bieber was like,</v>

2
00:00:05.521 --> 00:00:08.220
I don't like how MNM makes fun of all the young rappers. He was like,

3
00:00:08.221 --> 00:00:11.700
I like the young rap degeneration of young rap. I guess some of it is okay,

4
00:00:11.850 --> 00:00:14.910
but like who are you talking about? Kendrick Lamar. J Cole.

5
00:00:15.340 --> 00:00:17.310
Or are you talking about Kodak? Black?

6
00:00:20.070 --> 00:00:23.790
Are you talking about, you know what I mean? That Auto-Tune.

7
00:00:24.180 --> 00:00:26.130
It sounds good. But like

8
00:00:28.620 --> 00:00:31.230
people say like it's corny to rhyme all the. I was like,

9
00:00:31.231 --> 00:00:35.310
a lot of these rappers would just say a bunch of fast all together and it's

10
00:00:35.311 --> 00:00:36.780
corny, corny or than

11
00:00:39.890 --> 00:00:44.450
my girl thought my pool was an ocean. Oh, corny.

12
00:00:44.451 --> 00:00:45.770
Or than that

13
00:00:49.070 --> 00:00:52.820
corny or than a Kodak, black dude

14
00:00:54.470 --> 00:00:59.180
corny. Or then that cause no,

15
00:00:59.240 --> 00:01:02.270
you know, Hey, you know, no,

16
00:01:04.730 --> 00:01:08.870
you know, no though, you know,

17
00:01:08.900 --> 00:01:13.370
none of what any of those rappers who are lyrical,

18
00:01:14.150 --> 00:01:18.710
you know, they're not cornea. Then that look at,

19
00:01:18.860 --> 00:01:21.560
look at, I know I look them up sometimes, but.

20
00:01:26.390 --> 00:01:27.223
<v 1>Cool.</v>

21
00:01:27.410 --> 00:01:28.580
<v 0>Cormier than buying a</v>

22
00:01:32.510 --> 00:01:36.650
$180,000 diamond pacifier that Kodak black. I swear to God,

23
00:01:36.651 --> 00:01:41.120
Kodak black is trolling me. At this point. I made fun of him talking to Lee,

24
00:01:41.150 --> 00:01:42.080
looking like a Simpson.

25
00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:45.680
He made his hair look yellow and triangular like a Simpson.

26
00:01:45.830 --> 00:01:50.480
And now he's going to buy a baby pacifier thing, bro.

27
00:01:50.570 --> 00:01:51.500
Are you trolling me.

28
00:01:54.620 --> 00:01:57.320
Are you making fun of babies? Cause I will tell you right now.

29
00:01:59.420 --> 00:02:04.160
We'll get to, come on, dude. Kodak black.

30
00:02:04.490 --> 00:02:09.350
Are you trolling? Me bro. But yeah like.

31
00:02:13.460 --> 00:02:14.293
<v 1>Heartbreak</v>

32
00:02:23.570 --> 00:02:24.020
[inaudible].

33
00:02:24.020 --> 00:02:27.110
<v 0>Oh, Oh that's on a, that's an, a poster with a whales tail on it.</v>

34
00:02:29.120 --> 00:02:32.120
Oh you dude. You're saying lines that are in the mall.

35
00:02:33.140 --> 00:02:36.980
You're saying lines that I can go into one of those stores in and,

36
00:02:37.030 --> 00:02:40.820
and I could get like a, a, an Eagle soaring,

37
00:02:42.650 --> 00:02:43.160
any luck.

38
00:02:43.160 --> 00:02:46.040
<v 1>She tells me by my cover. So you can read between my life.</v>

39
00:02:46.130 --> 00:02:50.150
<v 0>There you go. Judge me by my cover. But you can't read between my lines. I,</v>

40
00:02:51.530 --> 00:02:55.280
you can go into one of those stores in the mall where they have the framed

41
00:02:55.281 --> 00:02:57.080
posters of a, of a Puffin.

42
00:02:57.500 --> 00:03:02.320
And you could see that under it excellence. You know, those God,

43
00:03:02.321 --> 00:03:04.780
those stores in the mall. When I was, I swear to God, I was four.

44
00:03:04.781 --> 00:03:06.340
I would walk by those stores in the mall and I would be like,

45
00:03:06.580 --> 00:03:10.180
what kind of loss did he would ever buy? It's his businesses.

46
00:03:10.181 --> 00:03:15.070
I guess I imagine being just like some lady with like kids and you walk by

47
00:03:15.071 --> 00:03:19.570
one of those, what would they call like success?

48
00:03:19.571 --> 00:03:23.560
What successories that's what they would call that.

49
00:03:24.640 --> 00:03:28.270
Successories wow. The whole thing was cute.

50
00:03:28.960 --> 00:03:32.890
It was a store in the mall. I don't know if they still have them. I mean,

51
00:03:33.130 --> 00:03:38.110
but they would be, you could go buy framed prints of like a

52
00:03:38.111 --> 00:03:41.080
whale breaching the ocean and it will be like,

53
00:03:41.860 --> 00:03:45.400
you only see the success. You don't see the hard work,

54
00:03:46.540 --> 00:03:48.950
you know, teamwork. And then, uh,

55
00:03:48.951 --> 00:03:53.530
a bunch of people rowing a boat on like in like dusk

56
00:03:55.120 --> 00:03:58.060
teamwork is the ability to work together toward a common vision.

57
00:03:58.240 --> 00:04:02.230
The ability to direct individual accomplishment toward organizational objective.

58
00:04:02.380 --> 00:04:06.190
Hey snore Fest, dude. No, come on.

59
00:04:07.540 --> 00:04:10.600
Look what you got to read teamwork. Imagine,

60
00:04:10.840 --> 00:04:14.380
imagine reading this and, and being like,

61
00:04:15.730 --> 00:04:20.500
well, my life's different now teamwork.

62
00:04:20.530 --> 00:04:23.410
Teamwork is the ability to work together towards a common vision.

63
00:04:23.590 --> 00:04:26.680
The ability to direct individual accomplishment towards

64
00:04:27.700 --> 00:04:29.290
organizational objective.

65
00:04:29.470 --> 00:04:33.550
It is the fuel that allows common people to attain uncommon results.

66
00:04:35.500 --> 00:04:38.470
At the end, it should just go F R R R T for a fart noise.

67
00:04:39.610 --> 00:04:41.890
And then they take the picture of the people just rowing and.

68
00:04:44.890 --> 00:04:46.360
This is Kodak black right here.

69
00:04:47.080 --> 00:04:50.830
Teamwork is the ability to work towards a common vision.

70
00:04:50.831 --> 00:04:55.810
I love when these dumb rappers just try to get like all it's

71
00:04:55.811 --> 00:04:58.540
so funny, do these rappers would be like, you know, this album,

72
00:04:59.350 --> 00:05:03.820
they basically just, you know, I had to speak with the I was going to,

73
00:05:03.880 --> 00:05:08.260
you know, it would be like, like ludicrous would do this.

74
00:05:08.950 --> 00:05:12.730
I meant to say, I mean, ludicrous is older now, but he would be like,

75
00:05:14.140 --> 00:05:18.880
you know, this album was really about what it's like for me,

76
00:05:19.090 --> 00:05:23.860
you know? And uh, so that's.

77
00:05:23.970 --> 00:05:24.803
<v 2>It's basically,</v>

78
00:05:26.550 --> 00:05:29.010
and then it would just be a song about cars.

79
00:05:31.110 --> 00:05:35.400
<v 0>These rappers are unreal. You know, this is really more about my life.</v>

80
00:05:35.430 --> 00:05:39.820
This album, this album is about basically what I'm talking about in my life,

81
00:05:39.920 --> 00:05:43.260
where you know, what's going on in my life. And if you don't like it,

82
00:05:43.290 --> 00:05:45.570
they always act like, and if you don't like it, you know,

83
00:05:46.230 --> 00:05:50.220
that's just me speaking on. What's my truth, doc, if you don't like it, then,

84
00:05:51.140 --> 00:05:54.450
then that's on you. Anyway, here we go.

85
00:05:59.750 --> 00:06:00.190
<v 2>Oh yeah.</v>

86
00:06:00.190 --> 00:06:03.610
<v 0>They got so much money. You can't stop that. Oh really?</v>

87
00:06:04.750 --> 00:06:05.583
You know what I mean?

88
00:06:07.300 --> 00:06:12.040
I just basically it's like, Oh, are you kidding, man?

89
00:06:13.540 --> 00:06:17.740
Legendary. He, Oh, that's a joke one, right? No, no.

90
00:06:17.950 --> 00:06:20.260
He was not a practical joke nor was he a fool,

91
00:06:20.261 --> 00:06:25.060
but he was determined determinedly original and had a vague and modest idea of

92
00:06:25.061 --> 00:06:28.510
himself as a legendary figure. No, that's not. That's gotta be a joke. One

93
00:06:30.130 --> 00:06:31.600
it's on successories.com

94
00:06:35.230 --> 00:06:37.840
Create your own. Oh. And now they have a create your own.

95
00:06:40.300 --> 00:06:41.440
Okay. Well that's awful.

96
00:06:43.570 --> 00:06:47.620
