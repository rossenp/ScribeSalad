00:00:03.600 --> 00:00:07.680
<v 0>Um, so my special does come out.</v>

2
00:00:08.490 --> 00:00:10.710
Uh it's out now. And, uh,

3
00:00:11.190 --> 00:00:14.910
my brother did direct it and I just want to say I'm really fortunate, man.

4
00:00:16.470 --> 00:00:20.100
I really am fortunate. Sure. I worked hard and stuff,

5
00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:24.960
but I'm really lucky to be in the position that I am. Um,

6
00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:29.820
and I realized that and I try, I do think about that a lot and,

7
00:00:31.350 --> 00:00:35.640
and my brother directed this special and it's just so cool that he did it

8
00:00:35.641 --> 00:00:38.700
because I love him. And, um,

9
00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:42.810
I mean, I really love him. Like,

10
00:00:43.650 --> 00:00:47.190
it's so awesome to have somebody like that.

11
00:00:47.191 --> 00:00:50.400
Like people always say like, how many kids you want to have? And I'm like, uh,

12
00:00:50.401 --> 00:00:54.240
two's good because I had one brother and no sisters and no other brother

13
00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:59.790
and everything that I didn't could

14
00:00:59.970 --> 00:01:01.680
couldn't talk to anybody about.

15
00:01:02.220 --> 00:01:07.110
I would do it with Matt because he was the only guy and that

16
00:01:07.111 --> 00:01:09.120
bond because of that is awesome.

17
00:01:09.120 --> 00:01:12.960
Now I'm not saying if you have three brothers or two sisters and a brother or

18
00:01:12.961 --> 00:01:15.450
whatever, you don't have that. But for me,

19
00:01:15.690 --> 00:01:20.460
I always felt cool that there was one other person that I can

20
00:01:20.461 --> 00:01:24.960
confide in and just know that that was down a ride. And so as I, for him,

21
00:01:25.440 --> 00:01:30.120
and of course I had an open, uh, you know, family with my mom, my dad,

22
00:01:30.121 --> 00:01:33.470
I could talk to them about everything. I mean, the first time I, I, I,

23
00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:36.360
I masturbated, I walked down and I told them and I walked down and I saw,

24
00:01:36.620 --> 00:01:39.780
and I was crying for real dude. I was a. And I,

25
00:01:39.781 --> 00:01:42.240
and I said to my mom and my mom said, what the hell is wrong?

26
00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:45.240
She was eating like jelly beans. My mom would always eat the jelly beans.

27
00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:48.240
And she would shuck them around her hand a little bit before she popped them in

28
00:01:48.241 --> 00:01:49.350
her mouth due to drove me nuts. I was like,

29
00:01:49.351 --> 00:01:50.640
why don't you just pick them up and eat them?

30
00:01:50.760 --> 00:01:53.220
What if they make it a game like that? He needs a new pair of shoes. Hey,

31
00:01:53.221 --> 00:01:56.280
there we go. But I was crying and she was like, what's wrong? And I said,

32
00:01:56.281 --> 00:01:58.440
it happened. And I thought she knew what I was going to talk about.

33
00:01:58.441 --> 00:02:02.150
And she said, what? And I said calming. And she said, Oh, go upstairs.

34
00:02:02.250 --> 00:02:03.360
And dad's coming home in 10 minutes.

35
00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:06.840
And that was when I got to talk about the birds and the bees.

36
00:02:07.530 --> 00:02:10.650
And that is beautiful, but anything I couldn't bring up,

37
00:02:10.651 --> 00:02:14.160
I would talk to my brother about. And, you know,

38
00:02:14.161 --> 00:02:17.430
I assume my brother did the same thing to me. We never hated each other.

39
00:02:17.431 --> 00:02:20.070
You know, I think he went through some weird because, uh,

40
00:02:20.100 --> 00:02:21.480
I was the older brother and just, you know,

41
00:02:21.481 --> 00:02:23.460
it's weird when you're growing up with an older brother,

42
00:02:24.210 --> 00:02:28.200
I feel like you probably have to like, you know, he did,

43
00:02:28.230 --> 00:02:33.210
I did everything first, you know? And then the, the second kid is like, okay,

44
00:02:33.211 --> 00:02:37.530
the second kid, we, we, we learned our mistakes and it's, you know, it's like,

45
00:02:37.531 --> 00:02:40.410
if you have 11 kids, 11 kid is just like, Oh yeah, what's his name again?

46
00:02:40.440 --> 00:02:41.820
You know? So, um,

47
00:02:42.360 --> 00:02:47.220
I feel like a really cool that my brother,

48
00:02:47.850 --> 00:02:52.230
I, I feel lucky that my brother directed it because he's great.

49
00:02:52.320 --> 00:02:55.710
First of all, he's talented. Um, but besides that,

50
00:02:56.340 --> 00:02:59.980
I love him and I genuinely love him deeply.

51
00:03:00.310 --> 00:03:05.110
And to have him a part of this experience helps me, you know,

52
00:03:05.260 --> 00:03:08.980
I mean, it was that way with my dad too. It was the coolest thing he was in. Uh,

53
00:03:09.010 --> 00:03:11.770
he was in, uh, the van. I remember when I shot my first special,

54
00:03:11.771 --> 00:03:15.880
he was in the van with the headphones on and I knew out there onstage,

55
00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:18.970
he was proud of me in that van, you know,

56
00:03:19.060 --> 00:03:22.300
and I would think about that while I was doing my special while I was talking to

57
00:03:22.301 --> 00:03:25.510
those people in new Orleans. And, uh,

58
00:03:25.690 --> 00:03:29.590
I got in my head a little bit with standup through, uh, the years,

59
00:03:29.710 --> 00:03:31.270
like in cordial, I felt good about,

60
00:03:31.271 --> 00:03:34.840
and then I started getting a little bit insecure because I didn't know what else

61
00:03:34.841 --> 00:03:35.674
to talk about.

62
00:03:36.100 --> 00:03:40.750
Man of fire was something that came up after Uncage was my third special and the

63
00:03:40.751 --> 00:03:44.410
material I had, I loved, but I just wasn't in a good place in my life.

64
00:03:44.411 --> 00:03:47.530
And my dad directed it and it was great and I'm really proud of it.

65
00:03:48.580 --> 00:03:51.280
And it was still in my head. I shot at comedians of the world.

66
00:03:51.760 --> 00:03:56.380
I really liked the way it came out. I, I don't, I'm lucky to have,

67
00:03:56.890 --> 00:04:00.250
uh, what I have, and I'm lucky to have shot what I have shot in my career,

68
00:04:00.580 --> 00:04:04.600
but man, uh, but this special, uh, no pain,

69
00:04:04.900 --> 00:04:06.220
which is one of the reasons why it's called no pain.

70
00:04:06.340 --> 00:04:07.990
Cause people always say pink comedy comes from pain,

71
00:04:08.470 --> 00:04:11.320
but I didn't really experience much of that in my life. And, um,

72
00:04:12.060 --> 00:04:14.200
I'm fortunate for that. And I always used to think that it was,

73
00:04:14.380 --> 00:04:16.480
it would make me insecure, uh,

74
00:04:16.600 --> 00:04:21.100
as it made me insecure that I didn't have that real to talk about as a comedian.

75
00:04:21.760 --> 00:04:25.540
And, um, and this one is just like, all that

76
00:04:27.040 --> 00:04:29.260
I have what I have. And I'm really lucky and I'm really fortunate.

77
00:04:29.680 --> 00:04:32.530
And I'm going to talk about what the I'm going to talk about.

78
00:04:33.190 --> 00:04:36.760
And I'm like, I have my dad, I'm like, I have a mom. I'm like,

79
00:04:36.761 --> 00:04:40.990
I have my own family, you know, and my brother directed it.

80
00:04:40.991 --> 00:04:44.080
And that's a real special thing for me, man. And, uh, so, you know,

81
00:04:44.110 --> 00:04:48.130
thank you Matt for doing it. Uh, and um, you made it great.

82
00:04:49.590 --> 00:04:53.190
Um, you know, it's cool to have a support system.

83
00:04:55.950 --> 00:04:59.430
Um, I dunno, I dunno if that's what you wanted, not wanting to hear. I mean,

84
00:04:59.431 --> 00:05:02.460
sometimes I talk like that and then people ended up being like, you bro,

85
00:05:02.461 --> 00:05:05.160
because, Oh, you don't know what real pain is. And it's like, okay.

86
00:05:05.340 --> 00:05:07.470
But some people, you know, I look,

87
00:05:07.471 --> 00:05:08.880
I'm just trying to be honest with you guys sometimes.

88
00:05:12.570 --> 00:05:17.250
Um, but yeah, so I'm excited.

89
00:05:17.370 --> 00:05:21.210
I'm really excited. And, uh, thanks for, uh,

90
00:05:21.240 --> 00:05:25.350
to everybody that ever has come out to see me and supported me online.

91
00:05:25.351 --> 00:05:28.290
Or even if you haven't come out to see me, if you just tell somebody I'm funny,

92
00:05:28.291 --> 00:05:29.640
that's so cool. And I appreciate it.
