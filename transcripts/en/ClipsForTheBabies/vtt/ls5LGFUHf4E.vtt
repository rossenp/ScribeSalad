1
00:00:01.680 --> 00:00:06.660
<v 0>Um, do it, but, uh, I make fun of like, Oh dude,</v>

2
00:00:06.661 --> 00:00:09.270
Biden. This is what I think about.

3
00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:12.390
I think that the thing about

4
00:00:14.430 --> 00:00:19.260
Bernie and Biden doing the crowd with no crowd doing the

5
00:00:19.261 --> 00:00:21.060
debates with no crowd is bad for Biden because Biden,

6
00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:22.890
when people clap at what he says,

7
00:00:23.040 --> 00:00:25.680
he resets and starts realizing what he's going to say next.

8
00:00:25.950 --> 00:00:27.570
And when that off the cuff,

9
00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:31.790
he just starts talking about whatever somebody said, Hey,

10
00:00:31.791 --> 00:00:34.670
what's up with the coronavirus? And he said in the camera's like, well,

11
00:00:34.671 --> 00:00:35.750
I'm just, you know,

12
00:00:35.751 --> 00:00:39.350
it's a shame that Sanders is siding with Trump and walked into a car

13
00:00:42.020 --> 00:00:45.650
Guys, guys, you know, I don't know, man,

14
00:00:47.150 --> 00:00:50.750
this is what I love too. I'll make fun of whoever any candidate. I don't give a.

15
00:00:51.200 --> 00:00:53.570
And like, you have to make fun of all of them. Right?

16
00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:58.280
You can't just make fun of some of them because that's not cool. And, um,

17
00:00:59.240 --> 00:01:03.830
I made fun of, uh, Trump because he did this thing. Oh, I said,

18
00:01:03.831 --> 00:01:04.664
it's really funny to,

19
00:01:04.720 --> 00:01:08.360
if it will be so hilarious if Trump got the coronavirus and of course funny,

20
00:01:08.361 --> 00:01:11.030
because he said it was a hoax five days ago and he's like,

21
00:01:11.031 --> 00:01:14.900
I don't feel any symptoms wrong. I don't feel any symptoms. Fine.

22
00:01:14.901 --> 00:01:16.640
I don't have it. I don't need to get tested.

23
00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:20.960
So it will be funny if he got the coronavirus. Now, obviously I'm being silly.

24
00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:23.750
Obviously. I don't want people to get the Corona virus.

25
00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:25.720
<v 1>You know? So.</v>

26
00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:30.650
<v 0>Some was like, what'd he say, let me just go to the tweets out.</v>

27
00:01:30.651 --> 00:01:33.470
Here we go. It will be so hilarious. If Trump cut the corner of ours,

28
00:01:33.471 --> 00:01:37.220
like so funny and some guy writes, why would it be funny? Explain. And I wrote,

29
00:01:37.250 --> 00:01:40.640
because he kept saying how he didn't need to get tested. He was so shore.

30
00:01:41.030 --> 00:01:43.580
So it would be funny if he actually had it weird. I have to explain that,

31
00:01:43.610 --> 00:01:45.560
but here we are. And then the wrote,

32
00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:48.080
but I'm still just trying to understand why it would be funny if your present

33
00:01:48.081 --> 00:01:52.820
contrast is a serious illness. So I said to the cook, I was being silly,

34
00:01:52.821 --> 00:01:56.720
but you knew that and you still ask me why it was funny. I explained knowing,

35
00:01:56.721 --> 00:02:01.040
you know, now you're asking again, pretending I meant what I said seriously,

36
00:02:01.160 --> 00:02:04.580
when you know, I'm a comedian, you're probably not stupid.

37
00:02:04.760 --> 00:02:09.140
So how come you're acting that way? So the cook said, first of all,

38
00:02:09.141 --> 00:02:13.400
I have no idea who you are now. Fine all by that for the argument,

39
00:02:13.790 --> 00:02:17.600
but you're a boy he's coming up.

40
00:02:18.860 --> 00:02:22.340
Also, you check the profile by now. had

41
00:02:24.440 --> 00:02:26.210
also, even if you didn't know, I was a comedian,

42
00:02:26.480 --> 00:02:31.070
you could assume that I'm not a sociopath with 1 million followers.

43
00:02:31.730 --> 00:02:35.930
And just hoping the president of the United States gets a

44
00:02:36.350 --> 00:02:41.300
deathly disease. Cause he's 70 whatever. And he says, first of all,

45
00:02:41.301 --> 00:02:43.280
I know who I have no idea who you are. Just,

46
00:02:43.340 --> 00:02:46.340
I just saw that your tweet was retweeted by a friend of mine.

47
00:02:46.790 --> 00:02:47.623
<v 1>Cool.</v>

48
00:02:48.650 --> 00:02:51.410
<v 0>Second, don't hide behind the label of comedian. The, and that's so big.</v>

49
00:02:51.411 --> 00:02:54.620
That's one of my favorite things. That's one of my favorite things. Oh,

50
00:02:54.621 --> 00:02:58.670
you're hiding behind the label of no, bro. I, uh, well, I'll get to it.

51
00:02:59.260 --> 00:03:04.030
That's so weak. He says, standing on stage with a mic and pandering for clapper.

52
00:03:04.031 --> 00:03:06.700
Doesn't make you a comedian. You have to actually be funny. Okay.

53
00:03:07.390 --> 00:03:11.380
So clap. There is get rid of that obviously,

54
00:03:11.560 --> 00:03:15.310
because I can't see the thing below it. One fire. Um, so clapper is,

55
00:03:15.470 --> 00:03:18.310
we can just say stuff to people will clap, which I don't do. Obviously,

56
00:03:18.311 --> 00:03:22.000
if you've ever been in my shows, any of my shows,

57
00:03:22.780 --> 00:03:23.800
I'm not trying to get clapped.

58
00:03:23.801 --> 00:03:28.000
Or when I'm talking about Cubans asking for directions, Yeti yet.

59
00:03:28.390 --> 00:03:33.010
So I wrote, if you don't know now I'm just breaking it down now.

60
00:03:33.040 --> 00:03:35.770
Just simply breaking it down.

61
00:03:37.570 --> 00:03:40.270
If you don't know who I am, then how on earth do you know what I do on stage?

62
00:03:40.540 --> 00:03:43.990
Now? Let me just, now, here we go. I got to get this going. Here we go.

63
00:03:44.920 --> 00:03:47.170
If you don't know who I am, then,

64
00:03:47.440 --> 00:03:50.620
then how on earth do you know what I do on stage?

65
00:03:52.030 --> 00:03:56.800
I'm not hiding behind, uh, any label.

66
00:03:56.830 --> 00:03:58.300
I'm literally a comedian.

67
00:04:00.400 --> 00:04:00.760
<v 1>Just.</v>

68
00:04:00.760 --> 00:04:02.800
<v 0>Because you don't think what I said is funny. Doesn't you?</v>

69
00:04:02.890 --> 00:04:03.760
It doesn't mean it's not.

70
00:04:03.790 --> 00:04:07.630
Let's ask random people who has a better sense of humor. Me or me or you.

71
00:04:07.900 --> 00:04:12.580
I said to the, and then he says,

72
00:04:13.120 --> 00:04:16.030
this is my favorite. And I can't even respond to it because it's awesome.

73
00:04:18.550 --> 00:04:22.090
Um, trust me, dude, I'm way funnier than you.

74
00:04:26.500 --> 00:04:29.080
Anyone who says, trust me, dude, is a

75
00:04:31.240 --> 00:04:35.830
like, it's just, well, you know, but you don't let that, but, but he says,

76
00:04:35.831 --> 00:04:39.280
but don't let that offend you. And then he follows it up with, um,

77
00:04:39.290 --> 00:04:40.630
extremely funny

78
00:04:42.520 --> 00:04:47.380
also lip also liberals are categorically insufferable now

79
00:04:48.160 --> 00:04:52.480
yet painfully unaware of this. So you've also got that working against you,

80
00:04:52.660 --> 00:04:55.000
perhaps you'll all be able to create.

81
00:04:55.630 --> 00:04:59.860
You'll all be able to create quality material again in 2024.

82
00:05:01.300 --> 00:05:05.980
Okay. So look, dude, first of all, you don't know who I am.

83
00:05:06.610 --> 00:05:09.850
You've said that. How do you know I'm.

84
00:05:09.850 --> 00:05:11.920
<v 1>A liberal? How.</v>

85
00:05:11.920 --> 00:05:15.940
<v 0>Do you know how far left I am? Because I'm not far left.</v>

86
00:05:16.420 --> 00:05:20.350
And I agree that a lot of far left liberals are extremely

87
00:05:21.310 --> 00:05:22.143
insufferable.

88
00:05:26.040 --> 00:05:26.873
<v 1>Also.</v>

89
00:05:28.470 --> 00:05:31.560
<v 0>Most of the most successful, no, this is just a fact.</v>

90
00:05:31.740 --> 00:05:36.720
Most of the most successful comedians are liberal. So,

91
00:05:36.721 --> 00:05:40.620
huh. So I write a,

92
00:05:43.380 --> 00:05:46.110
so I write just, I just retweeted and did the laughing,

93
00:05:46.111 --> 00:05:49.980
crying emoji face because obviously the guy lost his own argument with just

94
00:05:49.981 --> 00:05:53.880
saying all that. But uh, you can't keep arguing with a dumb.

95
00:05:56.130 --> 00:06:00.380
And then I went his page and looked and he had like this video of him

96
00:06:00.560 --> 00:06:03.200
sucking up to Trump. Like he's like I finally met Trump

97
00:06:05.540 --> 00:06:10.430
and like was such a like fan boy.

98
00:06:10.850 --> 00:06:13.610
Imagine being a fan boy to a 74 year.

99
00:06:15.250 --> 00:06:18.190
<v 1>You know? Um,</v>

100
00:06:19.360 --> 00:06:20.890
I love this world.

101
00:06:23.530 --> 00:06:27.370
<v 0>Like people like that get to exist and have a platform.</v>

102
00:06:29.110 --> 00:06:32.770
It's so awesome. So I retweeted it.

103
00:06:32.830 --> 00:06:35.260
I'm sure that has mentioned we're busy for a while.

104
00:06:35.261 --> 00:06:39.130
And then he said something like, Oh dude, I've off so many liberals.

105
00:06:39.280 --> 00:06:42.790
That's the other thing too. I'm not, I wasn't making any blanket statements.

106
00:06:42.791 --> 00:06:47.410
You can't just say, Oh all liberals. Like, just like,

107
00:06:47.411 --> 00:06:50.680
I'm not saying all, uh, you know, conservatives,

108
00:06:50.681 --> 00:06:52.420
because I don't think that man.

109
00:06:54.250 --> 00:06:58.420
And I'm out of this liberal, conservative. I'm out of it, dude.

110
00:06:58.480 --> 00:07:01.630
I'm I'm out. You've all it up. I'm out.

111
00:07:02.830 --> 00:07:07.450
I'm Ralph Nader in this, dude. I'm out color me,

112
00:07:07.451 --> 00:07:10.750
green bro. I'm out, man. I'm not in this.

113
00:07:11.620 --> 00:07:14.200
I'm not one way or the other y'all dude.

114
00:07:19.300 --> 00:07:23.110
I'm not crying. And I'm not saying, well, actually I'm not doing that.

115
00:07:23.980 --> 00:07:28.840
I'm out, bro. I just love how Biden was like,

116
00:07:29.290 --> 00:07:31.330
this is the, this is the that just

117
00:07:36.190 --> 00:07:39.280
My running mate will be a woman. He tweets.

118
00:07:40.900 --> 00:07:44.920
And I hate that. He did that because here's the thing, man.

119
00:07:46.210 --> 00:07:48.850
<v 1>Who cares? What?</v>

120
00:07:49.170 --> 00:07:51.660
<v 0>Yeah, that's the thing. The guy right under it wrote Democrats. See this.</v>

121
00:07:51.670 --> 00:07:53.440
I don't like when they blanket.

122
00:07:53.441 --> 00:07:57.340
I mean like Democrats only care about stop doing it like this. Just say heat.

123
00:07:57.670 --> 00:08:00.280
I hate that, man. But he is what he writes.

124
00:08:00.281 --> 00:08:03.790
He Democrats only care about what you are. Not who you are.

125
00:08:04.510 --> 00:08:06.970
Why does this guy, Joey? Saldino I don't know who he is.

126
00:08:06.971 --> 00:08:08.650
I'm assuming he's a big Republican,

127
00:08:08.890 --> 00:08:11.980
but why doesn't he realize that that's just going to mobilize,

128
00:08:12.460 --> 00:08:16.090
this is now I don't want anybody mobilizing like,

129
00:08:16.930 --> 00:08:19.720
but he's just, he doesn't realize that that's going to make Democrats be like,

130
00:08:20.290 --> 00:08:22.420
you he'd have more people on his side. Or if he was just like,

131
00:08:22.480 --> 00:08:26.530
Oh the Biden only cares about what you are. Not who you are. So.

132
00:08:31.780 --> 00:08:33.250
<v 1>My running mate will be a woman.</v>

133
00:08:34.870 --> 00:08:39.190
<v 0>W D say just fi find out who it is and then tell us, you know,</v>

134
00:08:40.630 --> 00:08:43.600
so I mean, it's so ridiculous to tell them, I wrote, tell us more about her.

135
00:08:43.601 --> 00:08:45.910
Will she be tall, short, brunette, blonde.

136
00:08:47.560 --> 00:08:48.393
<v 1>Like.</v>

137
00:08:48.400 --> 00:08:52.570
<v 0>You're trying to be not sexist. You sound in sexist. Also.</v>

138
00:08:52.571 --> 00:08:54.310
You sniff kids.

139
00:08:58.610 --> 00:08:59.443
Um, I don't know.

140
00:09:01.820 --> 00:09:05.240
Trump is just ridiculous. This

141
00:09:08.330 --> 00:09:12.590
David Brent. He did this thing. I, I tweeted it.

142
00:09:13.430 --> 00:09:16.070
It definitely got over the. I can't even believe SOCOM.

143
00:09:19.700 --> 00:09:20.533
<v 1>[Inaudible].</v>

144
00:09:20.540 --> 00:09:24.740
<v 0>You got to go on Twitter, Instagram and look at it. He goes like this. Yeah.</v>

145
00:09:24.741 --> 00:09:28.880
They came out with fake news and they found it out. And, but here it is. I said,

146
00:09:28.881 --> 00:09:31.100
Google was a part of it. They said it wasn't, but they are.

147
00:09:31.101 --> 00:09:35.360
I got proof right here. And then just goes point and full and flicks it away,

148
00:09:35.361 --> 00:09:40.160
dude, like it's a bugger and you're driving on the freeway,

149
00:09:40.340 --> 00:09:43.400
dude, the guy is such an.

150
00:09:45.530 --> 00:09:46.490
Unbelievable dude.

151
00:09:48.710 --> 00:09:52.100
How the president just goes,

152
00:09:52.760 --> 00:09:56.690
the president just goes Coby and tosses it out.

153
00:09:58.760 --> 00:10:02.840
Man. Remember when Colby dying was the worst thing. Wow.

154
00:10:02.870 --> 00:10:06.290
That was like a month ago. And now Jesus Christ.

155
00:10:11.180 --> 00:10:12.013
<v 1>Um.</v>

156
00:10:15.320 --> 00:10:19.580
<v 0>So insane. I think that's so funny that he did that kind of guy, such a.</v>

157
00:10:23.090 --> 00:10:25.160
And if I they're all, dude,

158
00:10:26.650 --> 00:10:31.520
all also how big

159
00:10:31.550 --> 00:10:35.630
for real, I don't care who you are. How big does your ego have to be?

00:10:36.560 --> 00:10:39.770
If you legitimately are running for president,

161
00:10:41.990 --> 00:10:44.030
you have to think, you know how to fix the country,

162
00:10:44.060 --> 00:10:47.750
which is wrong because nobody knows dude.

163
00:10:48.290 --> 00:10:52.340
And probably the people who do know aren't are smart enough to realize they

164
00:10:52.341 --> 00:10:55.430
think they don't know. Anyway, dude, everybody's.
