00:00:01.230 --> 00:00:05.130
<v 0>Um, and I got to Tik TOK, dude. How about that?</v>

2
00:00:05.700 --> 00:00:09.600
Have you guys been on tick tock, tick docks, the worst app.

3
00:00:10.470 --> 00:00:11.303
Do you guys know that?

4
00:00:12.570 --> 00:00:16.260
How come they always have to spell it differently to tick? Like what, what,

5
00:00:16.261 --> 00:00:20.010
what, what spells more wrong? Uh, apps or rappers?

6
00:00:21.030 --> 00:00:25.620
You know what I mean? Like all eyes on me with a Z or tick tock,

7
00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:27.840
T I K T O K

8
00:00:29.370 --> 00:00:32.310
Tik TOK is the worst app of all time. And it's all good,

9
00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:35.100
but it's sorta worst of all time. And I did one,

10
00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:39.000
I did a bunch last night and I was howling dude, how bad they are.

11
00:00:39.001 --> 00:00:42.810
They're so bad even doing them makes me cringe.

12
00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:45.300
Even though I'm making fun of it. I put on my Instagram, I said,

13
00:00:45.301 --> 00:00:48.420
this is my impression of a 12 year old. And it was like, and they're all like,

14
00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:51.510
how come everybody on tic-tac when they're doing tech jobs,

15
00:00:51.511 --> 00:00:53.100
they have to look up to the left like this

16
00:00:55.860 --> 00:00:59.790
and what do they got to do that? They're just like, w w w w eight.

17
00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:03.510
I saw a guy do a Tik TOK. Can we go on,

18
00:01:03.511 --> 00:01:08.310
is there like a tick tock.com or do I have to see it on my only on the phone?

19
00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:12.270
Yeah, but there's, there's YouTubes. They upload them to YouTube babies.

20
00:01:12.870 --> 00:01:15.270
That's why you're on fire. He doesn't think of the things that I think of

21
00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:21.210
a tick tock. Here we go. Look at these tick talks, bro. Some of the,

22
00:01:21.211 --> 00:01:23.310
I saw tick-tock the other day. You know how that guy, Cameron,

23
00:01:23.311 --> 00:01:26.040
something that Disney kid died do,

24
00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:29.970
there was like a 11 year old that was like playing the beginning of a song.

25
00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:34.170
And it said like, Carmen, yada, yada was pronounced dead.

26
00:01:34.171 --> 00:01:38.520
And the kid was just like this, like feeling it like pretending to cry.

27
00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:43.110
And then he just like, went like this and that was the tick-tock Hey guy,

28
00:01:44.010 --> 00:01:46.710
Hey dude. If you're my kid, I'll have words with you

29
00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:51.900
have words with your kids. If they're pretending to be email on Tik TOK.

30
00:01:52.860 --> 00:01:56.940
Seriously, dude. That's how I know I'm an old guy finally, besides my back pain.

31
00:01:57.840 --> 00:02:01.440
That's how I know I'm an old guy is that there's a really popular app finally.

32
00:02:01.470 --> 00:02:06.210
And I don't, I just can't tick tock, tick tock,

33
00:02:06.211 --> 00:02:11.100
dude, go yourself. You know, let's look at some of these though.

34
00:02:11.110 --> 00:02:15.870
Top 10, best tick tock challenges. Why is everything a challenge to you?

35
00:02:15.871 --> 00:02:20.670
Just hit record tick.

36
00:02:20.970 --> 00:02:23.610
Tocks that keep me happy in summer. Oh, this'll be a good one.

37
00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:29.833
I'll walk around. Like,

38
00:02:33.020 --> 00:02:37.280
I mean just so bad audio, such bad audio. Me.

39
00:02:38.030 --> 00:02:42.110
What is this? How to get taller?

40
00:02:44.540 --> 00:02:46.790
I mean, Jesus, mother. You know,

41
00:02:54.470 --> 00:02:56.330
girls in her pajamas, just jumping around.

42
00:02:59.920 --> 00:03:04.300
All right. I can't even, I mean, it's not even worth it, you know? That's how,

43
00:03:05.620 --> 00:03:06.670
but they always go like,

44
00:03:09.970 --> 00:03:14.830
Oh, what's that song that they,

45
00:03:15.010 --> 00:03:19.840
the distance is that Justin Bieber one. Oh, it is baby.

46
00:03:19.841 --> 00:03:24.220
That's like his first song right? Ever Tik TOK is like that.

47
00:03:26.740 --> 00:03:27.573
Like,

48
00:03:36.040 --> 00:03:40.180
dude, it's a weird dude. Everything's so weird.

49
00:03:42.040 --> 00:03:46.210
Tic TOK c'mon. Oh, they're killing it though, man. How do you make,

50
00:03:46.570 --> 00:03:50.050
I don't think money sponsors, I guess.

51
00:03:52.270 --> 00:03:56.590
Anyway, get it. Don't get a tick-tock somebody just comments on my app.

52
00:03:56.860 --> 00:03:58.780
Eat your cat challenge. Kay.

53
00:04:01.360 --> 00:04:03.460
