00:00:00.150 --> 00:00:02.340
<v 0>I'm sorry, but, uh, I,</v>

00:00:09.061 --> 00:00:12.260
one of the biggest, many big, bad guy, big bags.

5
00:00:12.350 --> 00:00:14.880
And we're trying to remake that movie actually like a couple of years ago.

6
00:00:14.910 --> 00:00:18.780
I also got you a box set of DVDs and you definitely never opened them from my

00:00:18.781 --> 00:00:20.910

10
00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:34.080
ha stole ice cream and then he went to go eat it and it fell on the,

11
00:00:34.130 --> 00:00:36.840
on the concrete. And he says, Oh crap, Hola.

12
00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:41.880
And I thought that guy, that the juxtaposition of him, Oh,

13
00:00:41.881 --> 00:00:45.840
this is, is this the scene? Oh my God, this is it. Let me play it.

14
00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:50.280
Let me play it. What is it? You just literally Googled crappola no man.

15
00:00:50.281 --> 00:00:54.960
Police Academy, six ice cream. Oh really? But it's called crappola. Oh,

16
00:00:54.961 --> 00:00:58.650
it is. Yeah. Crap. Hold on, hold on. Oh my God. Here.

17
00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:02.610
It's so we thought everything's online. I know. Always was.

18
00:01:02.830 --> 00:01:04.700
<v 1>That's so funny when I was eight. Look,</v>

19
00:01:06.670 --> 00:01:10.520
look is that Laravel no, push it back a little bit, boy. Never. We go,

20
00:01:14.660 --> 00:01:19.240
Oh crap. Hold up. Oh yeah. I forgot about that. Oh,

21
00:01:23.690 --> 00:01:25.160
you know what the, what the done that.

22
00:01:26.030 --> 00:01:29.690
<v 0>You know, what's so bad about the scene.</v>

23
00:01:30.580 --> 00:01:33.920
This is I'm going to I'm already to disagree. No, no, no, no, no, no, no.

24
00:01:34.160 --> 00:01:37.700
It's good to be ready to agree or disagree. I agree with that. Okay.

25
00:01:37.820 --> 00:01:42.260
But this is a mistake. This is not the script. Okay.

26
00:01:42.290 --> 00:01:45.410
This is a mistake that happened during shooting and they should have just done

27
00:01:45.411 --> 00:01:48.410
it again. All right. What is it? I don't know if I agree, dude,

28
00:01:49.490 --> 00:01:54.440
the actors saw S a bad that he goes to eat it and then it

29
00:01:54.441 --> 00:01:58.310
kind of falls off, but he knows it's supposed to fall. She's it off. And then,

30
00:01:58.311 --> 00:02:01.100
and then he waits for it, but he reacts too soon. Watch.

31
00:02:09.050 --> 00:02:12.680
<v 1>Oh boy. Oh boy. Oh boy, look, look, watch, watch it.</v>

32
00:02:16.880 --> 00:02:20.210
Also just cut earlier when it starts to tip, you know? Yeah.

33
00:02:21.020 --> 00:02:23.820
<v 0>So with one arm, just do it again. Just do it again.</v>

34
00:02:24.500 --> 00:02:26.270
Also tell you what I do like about that sequence though.

35
00:02:26.300 --> 00:02:30.380
The close-up of the ice cream falling is, is rad.

36
00:02:31.880 --> 00:02:35.360
Like that makes it to me way better, so much. So that while it was happening,

37
00:02:35.361 --> 00:02:37.960
I was like great closeup. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Yeah. I love to maker.

38
00:02:37.961 --> 00:02:40.220
I'm a filmmaker. When I say, I don't know. That's what you say.

39
00:02:40.370 --> 00:02:43.520
That one of my favorite things about this is going to look at the YouTube

40
00:02:43.521 --> 00:02:46.760
comments is always so funny. Can't believe I've found this. Whoever put this up.

41
00:02:46.790 --> 00:02:51.080
Thank you. It's still okay. I remember this. Oh,

42
00:02:51.081 --> 00:02:55.970
it was that guy, but that, that actor is rad and in so much. Oh,

43
00:02:56.030 --> 00:02:58.910
let me see. Tall guy. Really? Yeah. Yeah. Hmm.

44
00:03:02.280 --> 00:03:04.650
That's funny that there's other people's favorite parts. This is the internet.

45
00:03:04.651 --> 00:03:07.830
Here's the thing, though. There is no scene that you can't find.

46
00:03:08.580 --> 00:03:11.130
If it's from a movie, you remember you had other people remember it too.

47
00:03:11.190 --> 00:03:15.630
And it's online, dude. Hold on a second though. Uh, what?

48
00:03:15.631 --> 00:03:20.100
I was going to say something about this. Yeah. That's so bad. You're right,

49
00:03:20.101 --> 00:03:20.934
dude.

50
00:03:21.690 --> 00:03:25.830
<v 1>Oh boy. Oh boy. Oh boy. Oh boy. So much.</v>

51
00:03:29.130 --> 00:03:30.600
Oh, try Paula. By the way.

00:03:31.680 --> 00:03:36.420
<v 0>He's saying, Oh boy. So much, because honestly he's such a bad.</v>

53
00:03:36.600 --> 00:03:40.530
Right? Right, right, right. Like no reaction here is it? Matter of fact.

54
00:03:40.590 --> 00:03:43.530
Don't watch this. Just listen.

55
00:03:43.890 --> 00:03:47.970
It couldn't sound more like a guy bust a nut too quick.

56
00:03:48.660 --> 00:03:51.270
<v 1>Right, right, right. Yeah. Oh boy. Oh boy. Oh boy.</v>

57
00:03:52.500 --> 00:03:55.800

00:04:12.510 --> 00:04:14.490
And that's him coming? Oh crap. Hold on.

00:04:15.090 --> 00:04:19.710
<v 0>And he came too early. The old crap all day. She came to the,</v>

62
00:04:19.980 --> 00:04:22.440
Oh boy. Oh boy is a really, I'm going to come to quickly.

63
00:04:22.890 --> 00:04:26.790
It is in the laughing too, because he's so nervous. He's so nervous.

64
00:04:26.910 --> 00:04:29.370
<v 1>Oh boy. Oh boy. Oh boy.</v>

65
00:04:31.440 --> 00:04:34.470
<v 0>Oh, the amount he's out of breath. Like that's exactly aligned.</v>

66
00:04:34.470 --> 00:04:36.990
<v 1>With it's because he's so big and walking.</v>

67
00:04:37.230 --> 00:04:39.270
<v 0>Right, right. Right. If you're that big,</v>

68
00:04:39.360 --> 00:04:43.250
just walking gets you straight up out of. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. We all know that.

69
00:04:43.251 --> 00:04:46.680
We all know that. So for sure. Um, okay. Wait,

70
00:04:46.681 --> 00:04:51.390
so man. I'm laughing. You know,

71
00:04:51.480 --> 00:04:54.630
I know I'm laughing. I laughed so much, dude. Do you laugh a lot?

72
00:04:55.110 --> 00:04:57.480
Some people don't love it. So I talk about this one dozen buckets.

73
00:04:57.960 --> 00:05:00.720
I just don't get some people just don't laugh, dude,

74
00:05:00.721 --> 00:05:04.590
laugh more like everybody laugh more. Now people don't want to,

75
00:05:04.750 --> 00:05:08.430
they want to be so serious. And so, so taken so seriously. That's so upsetting.

76
00:05:08.940 --> 00:05:12.810
I know, but whatever crappola, you know, total crappola.

77
00:05:14.100 --> 00:05:17.400
Um, I wanna thing. So I know that's in your mind. Yeah.

78
00:05:18.150 --> 00:05:21.570
That's what's fitting the guy from police Academy. So no, that guy was around.

79
00:05:21.810 --> 00:05:22.890
Yeah. Yeah. By the way,

80
00:05:22.980 --> 00:05:26.610
let's just say right now there was no one greater in the eighties or nineties

81
00:05:26.640 --> 00:05:27.750
then whoever that guy was,

82
00:05:27.751 --> 00:05:29.580
who did all the sounds in police Academy and that's it.

83
00:05:29.580 --> 00:05:31.260
And we're not talking about it. Yeah. I mean,

84
00:05:31.410 --> 00:05:35.430
PR police got to miss so much great. The dude, Paul Proctor. I mean that, dude,

85
00:05:35.431 --> 00:05:37.260
I just made fun of this last night on stage.

86
00:05:37.470 --> 00:05:42.360
I just talked about this last night on stage, the, the, the,

87
00:05:43.020 --> 00:05:44.010
the, the,

88
00:05:44.070 --> 00:05:48.450
the mic was buzzing when I was on stage and it wouldn't stop.

89
00:05:48.720 --> 00:05:51.270
And I got the guy, I was like, yo, can you fix this?

90
00:05:51.271 --> 00:05:56.010
And they had to literally bring a ladder on stage to go up while I'm on stage

91
00:05:56.460 --> 00:05:58.010
to go up and unplug a speaker.

92
00:05:58.040 --> 00:06:00.920
<v 1>So it would stop buzzing. And when he got on the ladder,</v>

93
00:06:01.010 --> 00:06:05.870
it kind of like fell back a little bit. And I was like, Oh, I John candy movie.

94
00:06:06.080 --> 00:06:08.270
Like, like, I was like, I was like, like you remember in the eighties,

95
00:06:08.271 --> 00:06:11.870
when they would like do and they wouldn't stop themselves, they'd be like, Whoa.

96
00:06:11.930 --> 00:06:14.210
And he'd keep holding on the, you like, just let go.

97
00:06:15.020 --> 00:06:17.300
And then I brought up like the where he'd be like, Oh,

98
00:06:17.330 --> 00:06:20.390
I have to tell you something. And he'd be like, Proctor, not now, you know?

99
00:06:20.391 --> 00:06:21.230
And he'd be like, but I have to.

100
00:06:21.380 --> 00:06:24.830
And then you get hit in the head with an anvil and just say the thing,

101
00:06:25.070 --> 00:06:28.580
just be like, does it Advil? I just said that on LA.

102
00:06:28.840 --> 00:06:32.680
<v 0>On stage last night. Yeah. Those police Academy movies are the.</v>

103
00:06:33.940 --> 00:06:37.750
Michael Winslow was the guy, but yeah, Michael wins though.

104
00:06:37.870 --> 00:06:39.100
And he was the Vel.

105
00:06:39.730 --> 00:06:44.230
Michael Winslow was the guy that would just go like nobody's character was yeah.

106
00:06:44.231 --> 00:06:48.700
The Lavelle Lavelle Jones. Yeah. Michael Winslow is the guy's rules.

107
00:06:49.780 --> 00:06:52.120
Um, so eh, by the way, you know,

108
00:06:52.121 --> 00:06:55.720
a white guy wrote the script and named the character. Laravel and that's racist.

109
00:06:55.721 --> 00:06:59.890
So, um, Laravel Carvel. Yeah. I guess. Or like larva.

110
00:07:00.820 --> 00:07:03.640
Okay. And then, but then remember the David Graf, go back, go back.

111
00:07:03.641 --> 00:07:06.970
You're going too far. One fire. And so too far, he's going too far. Right?

112
00:07:07.000 --> 00:07:09.550
He went too far. That makes us mad. He's just going way too far, too fast.

113
00:07:09.551 --> 00:07:11.110
So David graph,

114
00:07:11.140 --> 00:07:15.370
Eugene Tackleberry remember when he held the gun to the shark and the shark swim

115
00:07:15.371 --> 00:07:16.204
away.

116
00:07:18.040 --> 00:07:21.340
Tackleberry and high tower where like the bad-ass wall and then Steve Gutenberg.

117
00:07:21.760 --> 00:07:23.860
Do it. Let me just say this right. I'm going to agree, dude.

118
00:07:23.890 --> 00:07:28.000
Steve Gutenberg's face. Yeah, dude. Okay.

119
00:07:28.380 --> 00:07:30.760
I'm I was so ready to agree. I don't know where you're going to say. Yeah,

120
00:07:31.030 --> 00:07:33.550
I agree. No,

121
00:07:33.630 --> 00:07:36.520
Steve Gutenberg's face Steve Gutenberg.

122
00:07:36.850 --> 00:07:39.280
His face looks like Steve.

123
00:07:39.490 --> 00:07:43.030
It looks like he's wearing a Steve Gutenberg face.

124
00:07:44.350 --> 00:07:46.030
<v 1>Dude. Look how rad look at that.</v>

125
00:07:46.510 --> 00:07:47.800
<v 0>Oh dude. Steve Gutenberg.</v>

126
00:07:48.310 --> 00:07:52.300
<v 1>The picture that you have with the purple that's so suicide behind it.</v>

127
00:07:52.630 --> 00:07:57.340
<v 0>Dude, that guy, the devil and Steve Gutenberg. That is an article I'd read.</v>

128
00:07:58.150 --> 00:08:01.450
I'd prioritize, reading that article over almost anything. You know,

129
00:08:01.451 --> 00:08:03.600
Steve Gutenberg gets so mad. He blacked out for 20 minutes.

130
00:08:03.670 --> 00:08:05.650
It wakes up and thinks, Oh God, let's what were we doing?

131
00:08:05.680 --> 00:08:08.530
You know what else though? To what? For real, his,

132
00:08:08.860 --> 00:08:13.660
his Dick hard is like three inches, you know? Yeah.

133
00:08:13.960 --> 00:08:16.690
No, his Dick is bigger limp than it is hard.

134
00:08:17.290 --> 00:08:21.430
It goes bans a little bit. Like scientists would look at it and they'd be like,

135
00:08:21.431 --> 00:08:23.560
what's going on? Yeah. They could be like, first of all,

136
00:08:23.561 --> 00:08:26.830
take off that mask and be like, not a mask, but Steve Gutenberg.

137
00:08:27.130 --> 00:08:30.700
<v 1>How much is Steve Goldberg? A guy that would get into jujitsu later.</v>

138
00:08:35.050 --> 00:08:35.883
Wow, dude,

139
00:08:37.320 --> 00:08:40.720
you join a jujitsu class and you'd be like, Oh my gosh,

140
00:08:40.810 --> 00:08:42.220
did you have a Bloomberg? And he here's a Brown.

141
00:08:42.220 --> 00:08:44.380
<v 0>Belt while he's going through a divorce while he's going through.</v>

142
00:08:44.380 --> 00:08:48.310
<v 1>A divorce. You're like heard it's good for your mom.</v>

143
00:08:50.230 --> 00:08:53.740
He is so a guy that would get into jujitsu late in life.

144
00:08:54.160 --> 00:08:56.070
How many Holy of him are.

145
00:08:56.070 --> 00:09:00.750
<v 0>There with his shirt off. And why is he so yoked dude?</v>

146
00:09:00.940 --> 00:09:03.660
Looking at it. There's a video on YouTube. Steve Gutenberg, shirtless.

147
00:09:03.661 --> 00:09:08.010
He's got the raddest body. That's something ever already.

148
00:09:08.030 --> 00:09:10.260
I knew that already. Every time he took off his shirt,

149
00:09:10.261 --> 00:09:12.990
he was so shredded and also puffed.

150
00:09:13.170 --> 00:09:16.290
It was unbelievable how shredded it was because his face doesn't go with a

151
00:09:16.300 --> 00:09:20.310
shredded body doesn't but it does in the eighties. And that's why,

152
00:09:20.730 --> 00:09:25.350
that's why he was so famous because they keep [inaudible] eighties. I mean,

153
00:09:26.070 --> 00:09:30.380
he was great, man. What a rad guy does he ever know?

154
00:09:30.530 --> 00:09:34.100
Smile? I don't think so. Like when he's sleeping he's he's got his teeth,

155
00:09:35.270 --> 00:09:39.230
right? I think it rad body. I think so. Oh.

156
00:09:40.370 --> 00:09:45.320
Does it Google do jujitsu and Steve Goldberg might get lucky go to

157
00:09:45.321 --> 00:09:48.500
Google images. He wasn't three men and a baby, which also rules. Yep.

158
00:09:49.070 --> 00:09:53.810
He did a lot of cool. Talk about a guy that just couldn't be famous.

159
00:09:53.811 --> 00:09:56.240
Now if he was that age now,

160
00:09:56.270 --> 00:09:59.540
like he would literally never get hired. Yeah.

161
00:09:59.570 --> 00:10:03.860
I know like much of like a regular looking white guy. Like yeah.

162
00:10:04.070 --> 00:10:08.150
Good luck, dude. I'm still laughing at you.

163
00:10:10.190 --> 00:10:14.930
Who the is that guy? Yeah. John Heinz. Owner of him. Monkey bar gym. Um, dude,

164
00:10:15.410 --> 00:10:19.520
uh, no Steve Gutenberg for sure. I can't. I mean,

165
00:10:20.300 --> 00:10:21.170
cause I used to do jujitsu.

166
00:10:21.171 --> 00:10:24.710
There would be guys that would be like in the class and he would just so be one

167
00:10:24.711 --> 00:10:28.250
of those guys and he would be good and it'd be so annoying and you'd be like,

168
00:10:28.280 --> 00:10:31.280
Hey, I should be able to kick his, but right.

169
00:10:31.340 --> 00:10:35.780
He's also got really good chest hair. That guy. Yeah, he does.

170
00:10:35.781 --> 00:10:38.210
He's also aged kind of well, he looks kind of good.

171
00:10:38.240 --> 00:10:41.450
He just looks exactly the same. Ah, man. What's he doing?

172
00:10:41.480 --> 00:10:44.750
There's go him and polarize. You need to do a movie dude about jujitsu. Yeah.

173
00:10:45.350 --> 00:10:49.790
They could play like brothers of all time. That would be the worst.

174
00:10:49.880 --> 00:10:53.930
A movie of all time. If Steve Gutenberg and what's his name? Andy Paul riser.

175
00:10:54.110 --> 00:10:56.870
Dead movie about jujitsu at late in life. I mean I would,

176
00:10:56.930 --> 00:10:58.190
but the thing is it would be bad,

177
00:10:58.191 --> 00:11:01.880
but there's no way I wouldn't watch the living out of it. Look,

178
00:11:01.881 --> 00:11:05.390
he was a short circuit. Could cause so much. Look at that.

179
00:11:05.391 --> 00:11:06.650
There's nothing more eighties than go down.

180
00:11:06.740 --> 00:11:08.270
Then that image right there of that thing, go down.

181
00:11:08.300 --> 00:11:12.620
Look the classic trailer of the two people yelling with loud dude to Laravel,

182
00:11:12.621 --> 00:11:17.420
you know, Vail a bro, for no reason, it will be like,

183
00:11:17.421 --> 00:11:20.480
well we gotta get Le Laravel on the case. And then he would just be like, blah,

184
00:11:20.660 --> 00:11:24.710
blah. Yeah. And then they break in the thing. Nobody would do the air.

185
00:11:24.770 --> 00:11:28.610
He'd walked through the airport thing and he would do the sound for no reason.

186
00:11:29.000 --> 00:11:31.190
No reason. Even as a kid, I was like, dude,

187
00:11:31.191 --> 00:11:34.220
did he get the part or did they write the thing? The perfect guy.

188
00:11:34.820 --> 00:11:35.780
Let me tell you something.

189
00:11:36.140 --> 00:11:40.520
I have thought about that exact question. Yeah.

190
00:11:41.240 --> 00:11:45.530
For like a grand total, probably of like 70 hours.

191
00:11:46.160 --> 00:11:48.260
We can find that out. It's very easy to find that out.

192
00:11:48.261 --> 00:11:52.350
We just find out one of the writers and and but, but they,

193
00:11:52.490 --> 00:11:54.910
they had to written it for like, you know, you know what I mean? Like,

194
00:11:55.480 --> 00:11:59.430
well maybe he got the part and they were like, no, no, no there's no day.

195
00:11:59.440 --> 00:12:00.670
Like I know what the ride was. Like.

196
00:12:00.700 --> 00:12:02.470
I also know this guy who could do sound effects.

197
00:12:02.471 --> 00:12:03.850
We could include that into the thing. Right.

198
00:12:04.230 --> 00:12:07.540
Maybe he was already big for being that, got to get the sound guy.

199
00:12:07.600 --> 00:12:10.510
He was probably like a comedian ish kind of guy that would do like,

200
00:12:10.511 --> 00:12:12.130
sounds like an impression of comedians and.
