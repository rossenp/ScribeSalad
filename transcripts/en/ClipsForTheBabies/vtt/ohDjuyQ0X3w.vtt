00:00:00.540 --> 00:00:03.900
<v 0>Dude, my, both of the guys I took to open for me,</v>

2
00:00:03.901 --> 00:00:08.550
Craig and Mike were due. They took all the merchandise, packed all the merchant.

3
00:00:08.580 --> 00:00:10.550
They didn't even pack it. They put it in. I said,

4
00:00:10.551 --> 00:00:14.180
I'm getting a sprinter van for the weekend. Ah, cool.

5
00:00:15.170 --> 00:00:19.970
And they usually pack up like three suitcases of merch and stuff.

6
00:00:19.971 --> 00:00:22.370
It all in there. And instead they didn't,

7
00:00:22.371 --> 00:00:26.810
they just took the boxes of Merck and put it in the van on the way to Riverside.

8
00:00:27.080 --> 00:00:29.810
And we got out of the car and I was like, what the?

9
00:00:30.320 --> 00:00:35.270
And there were like eight boxes of merge. And I was like, what is all this?

10
00:00:35.540 --> 00:00:38.090
And they were like, Oh, we'll just go, we'll leave it in the van.

11
00:00:38.270 --> 00:00:40.520
And I was like, what? And they were like, well,

12
00:00:40.521 --> 00:00:42.770
we're just going to put it in a van. Right. And I was like, no,

13
00:00:42.771 --> 00:00:44.780
what are you talking about? And he said, we're not, well,

14
00:00:44.781 --> 00:00:48.800
this van isn't with us for the weekend. And I said, no, it's not dude.

15
00:00:51.650 --> 00:00:55.430
Now let me explain why that's stupid. Now, everybody, if you're like me,

16
00:00:55.970 --> 00:00:59.330
your blood's boiling. Right, right. Even just reminiscing about it. Okay.

17
00:00:59.720 --> 00:01:03.320
Now I want you to just take a step back. Right? I want you to just relax.

18
00:01:03.321 --> 00:01:05.870
I want you to take that blood. I want you to dial it down a notch.

19
00:01:05.871 --> 00:01:08.480
I want you to, I want you to turn down the heat.

20
00:01:08.481 --> 00:01:11.450
I want it to go from medium to light medium. I want it to just,

21
00:01:11.451 --> 00:01:15.080
I want you to take the oven and I want you to just turn it down. Okay.

22
00:01:15.710 --> 00:01:19.970
Now why does that make us mad now? I'll tell you why it makes us mad. Okay.

23
00:01:20.450 --> 00:01:24.860
Here's why getting a,

24
00:01:24.950 --> 00:01:29.900
getting a car to take you from, from LA to Riverside. It's about 300 bucks.

25
00:01:30.140 --> 00:01:33.500
Okay. Getting your car to, uh,

26
00:01:33.530 --> 00:01:37.130
to take it from Riverside to San Diego spot. 300 bucks. Okay.

27
00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:42.560
Get in your car from San Diego back to LA. It's about 500 bucks. Okay.

28
00:01:42.580 --> 00:01:47.570
So that's all expense. Fine. It doesn't matter. Sure. I, you know,

29
00:01:47.750 --> 00:01:52.550
I need to get their bags bags. I understand, but need to bring it back.

30
00:01:52.580 --> 00:01:54.230
Okay. So that's about a thousand dollars,

31
00:01:54.231 --> 00:01:56.480
whatever you want to call a little bit more than a thousand dollars. Okay. Now,

32
00:01:57.080 --> 00:02:01.430
if I rent the driver all weekend. Yeah, sure.

33
00:02:01.431 --> 00:02:05.450
No dents, but that's going to be five grand. Okay.

34
00:02:05.750 --> 00:02:08.300
Now that's well, it's actually going to be more than five grand.

35
00:02:08.510 --> 00:02:12.350
It's going to be seven, eight, nine grand. Now would I do that? Sure. No dense,

36
00:02:12.470 --> 00:02:14.810
but what I do that, no, because it just makes no

37
00:02:16.490 --> 00:02:20.690
sense to anyone. Who's not a caveman. All right. Or a four-year-old.

38
00:02:21.200 --> 00:02:24.380
Okay. So there we go. Now that's where the blood's Ryzen. Okay.

39
00:02:24.381 --> 00:02:27.670
Now of course I told you the dog. Now I understand if you're, if you're like me,

40
00:02:27.690 --> 00:02:29.180
you're listening to me. And if you're a longtime fan of John,

41
00:02:29.510 --> 00:02:32.870
that I understand your blood is boiling because you like me, you get it.

42
00:02:32.900 --> 00:02:36.530
We're part of the art. When you're a cult, your blood boils together.

43
00:02:36.950 --> 00:02:40.940
So our blood is boiling. It's boiling, it's pot.

44
00:02:41.090 --> 00:02:44.750
It's piping hot dude. And I'm mad. Now,

45
00:02:46.540 --> 00:02:50.600
let me tell you why, why it's real hard to keep the blood from,

46
00:02:51.980 --> 00:02:54.800
really bursting out of my eyeballs. Okay.

47
00:02:56.510 --> 00:03:00.340
Mike's been open in me with me for six years.

48
00:03:02.310 --> 00:03:06.840
We have done hundreds and hundreds of

49
00:03:06.841 --> 00:03:07.674
cities

50
00:03:08.970 --> 00:03:12.870
and we haven't never one time

51
00:03:14.010 --> 00:03:16.770
ever done it that way.

52
00:03:19.200 --> 00:03:22.980
Okay. So those of you still with us,

53
00:03:24.510 --> 00:03:29.460
those of you who didn't pass on yet because of the blood coming out of your eyes

54
00:03:29.461 --> 00:03:33.720
and ears. Okay. Because I'm Zen right now. I'm just chilling.

55
00:03:35.820 --> 00:03:40.560
Uh, He says, well.

56
00:03:40.950 --> 00:03:45.600
Now we got to take all the boxes with us to the hotel and then back to San Diego

57
00:03:46.050 --> 00:03:47.250
and then back to the thing.

58
00:03:47.251 --> 00:03:50.940
And then we've got to put it in the box and the V and I say, you know,

59
00:03:50.941 --> 00:03:53.190
when you get so mad that you're just kinda like, yeah,

60
00:03:53.191 --> 00:03:56.550
there's nothing he can do. And okay, cool. So we'll just chill and I'll be mad,

61
00:03:58.080 --> 00:04:00.870
right? I say, that's cool, man.

62
00:04:02.310 --> 00:04:04.290
I'm not carrying a box.

63
00:04:06.810 --> 00:04:10.260
So now he has to deal with it because he, this is my impression of him.

64
00:04:11.430 --> 00:04:15.730
And then Craig too, was like, Oh, that's when I thought I found that.

65
00:04:15.810 --> 00:04:17.520
Then we were tanking. Oh yeah,

66
00:04:17.521 --> 00:04:21.510
you got 19 grand to just

67
00:04:22.470 --> 00:04:24.780
dude. Oh, no

68
00:04:27.480 --> 00:04:32.370
quick farts broke. Yeah.

69
00:04:32.371 --> 00:04:36.660
You knew, dude. Do some mental, do some thought, man,

70
00:04:37.650 --> 00:04:41.820
do thought, Hey man, do thought,

71
00:04:44.520 --> 00:04:45.353
thought,

72
00:04:45.750 --> 00:04:50.700
do it not do that beyond the first

73
00:04:51.210 --> 00:04:54.360
thought, take it there.

74
00:04:57.120 --> 00:05:01.290
How could you be such a ignoramus? Now if Mike were here, he would say,

75
00:05:01.470 --> 00:05:04.560
ignoramus. I never heard that word. Thought,

76
00:05:06.720 --> 00:05:08.280
take it past that

77
00:05:12.360 --> 00:05:17.130
guys. Getting all, carrying boxes. And I'm sitting around like, I'm a, like,

78
00:05:17.131 --> 00:05:21.540
I'm a laughing. Like I'm that guy.

79
00:05:22.530 --> 00:05:24.990
Look at them. Carry the boxes. It's their own fault.

80
00:05:27.840 --> 00:05:29.280
There's nothing they can do. Dude.

81
00:05:29.281 --> 00:05:32.130
If I play a character in a real serious drama and I'm like,

82
00:05:34.440 --> 00:05:38.880
you think I won't win an Oscar, dude. you. You think I won't win an Oscar?

83
00:05:38.970 --> 00:05:40.290
I want a Oscar

84
00:05:41.970 --> 00:05:44.370
[inaudible] and everybody on set when I'm doing, I'll be like,

85
00:05:44.371 --> 00:05:48.240
I dunno if that's the move and then it comes out, bro. That's it

86
00:05:51.620 --> 00:05:56.280
like raps. My neck hurts my lipstick. My lower back hurts. It's all good.

87
00:05:57.050 --> 00:06:01.160
One of the vans we took back from, uh,

88
00:06:02.900 --> 00:06:06.740
San Diego, bro. No, look, I don't know if I got an iron deficiency or what,

89
00:06:09.080 --> 00:06:13.520
let me be real with your babies. When I go to a hotel room,

90
00:06:13.640 --> 00:06:15.770
I keep that. 76,

91
00:06:16.340 --> 00:06:20.300
75 might as well be an ice box for me.

92
00:06:21.650 --> 00:06:25.730
I'll keep that. 76. I go in and the air is always blaring.

93
00:06:26.060 --> 00:06:28.780
First thing daddy does is turn that off. I let the,

94
00:06:28.970 --> 00:06:31.700
I let the mechanism rest for about five minutes.

95
00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:36.050
And then that it turns that heat up bro. 76,

96
00:06:40.210 --> 00:06:45.100
At least. Do you understand me? Okay.

97
00:06:45.580 --> 00:06:49.270
Now my opener Mike is a fat.

98
00:06:50.920 --> 00:06:54.760
All right. Now we know about fat. Dude, they get what?

99
00:06:55.210 --> 00:06:57.370
Say it together. If you're in your car, you're in your cubicle.

100
00:06:57.910 --> 00:07:00.820
Everyone said together, they get what? Sweaty.

101
00:07:02.770 --> 00:07:07.060
Okay? Their hands are all clammy and they're, you know what I mean?

102
00:07:08.170 --> 00:07:11.650
It's all sweat. It's got all sweaty, sweat.

103
00:07:11.680 --> 00:07:14.920
They sweat on there where everyone it together, forehead,

104
00:07:17.440 --> 00:07:20.380
everyone stayed together. sweat. Where I wanna say together under their,

105
00:07:20.381 --> 00:07:24.370
under their nose in their lap. I remember when you were, remember that one kid,

106
00:07:24.371 --> 00:07:27.940
when you were in, uh, like fourth grade that got the sweat above his lip.

107
00:07:27.941 --> 00:07:31.840
What the was wrong with that kid, bro? I could sweat.

108
00:07:31.841 --> 00:07:36.490
I could be in the Sahara desert with a parka on and snow

109
00:07:36.491 --> 00:07:39.280
pants and straight up a ski hat.

110
00:07:40.090 --> 00:07:43.630
And if I would never get the beads of sweat above my lip, dude,

111
00:07:43.780 --> 00:07:48.160
that kids was always so that kid. I would stare at that kid, man,

112
00:07:48.580 --> 00:07:53.290
when he would talk and be like, why are there beads of sweat above his lip.

113
00:07:53.380 --> 00:07:57.010
<v 1>The sweats on their lip, bro. Grow up, hurry up.</v>

114
00:07:57.130 --> 00:08:01.150
<v 0>Grow up and grow mustache. Hide it. Do it.</v>

115
00:08:01.151 --> 00:08:04.870
I'd rather see someone with a wet stash than a beat it up or lip

116
00:08:05.860 --> 00:08:10.000
IL dude, bro.

117
00:08:14.140 --> 00:08:18.010
Anyway, he's like, Oh, it's so hot.

118
00:08:18.700 --> 00:08:22.990
So we turn on the air fine. Now, you know like with cars,

119
00:08:23.230 --> 00:08:26.460
I literally, if you can get your D your,

120
00:08:26.461 --> 00:08:28.690
your temperature perfect in your car,

121
00:08:29.380 --> 00:08:33.550
I straight up don't believe you it's either too cold or too hot.

122
00:08:33.580 --> 00:08:38.560
That's how cars go because you're in too close proximity to the air

123
00:08:38.561 --> 00:08:41.380
conditioners or the heater. All right. You cramped up.

124
00:08:42.520 --> 00:08:45.520
You're basically in a little thing, you know,

125
00:08:46.060 --> 00:08:49.510
you're like getting this movable large embryo

126
00:08:50.650 --> 00:08:55.180
anyway. Uh, so,

127
00:09:00.380 --> 00:09:04.640
So I went, so it was cold. And then, uh,

128
00:09:07.010 --> 00:09:11.030
so it was cold. And then, and I was like, it's too hot or it's too cold.

129
00:09:11.031 --> 00:09:13.910
So I put the on. And dude, when I turned the air off,

130
00:09:16.130 --> 00:09:18.350
The thing still counts. What degrees it is.

131
00:09:20.180 --> 00:09:24.680
So I turned the air off and it quickly ripped up to 82 degrees. Now, guess what?

132
00:09:24.681 --> 00:09:29.030
I am happy and I'm serious and I'm not sweating. I'm chilling.

133
00:09:29.510 --> 00:09:34.370
Do I have an iron deficiency? Mayb. I fall asleep for a little bit.

134
00:09:35.330 --> 00:09:39.560
Now. Sometimes Mike will sneak to Aaron, but that's when I get ripped warn Matt.

135
00:09:40.370 --> 00:09:44.930
Okay. So he didn't do it this time. I wake up bro. He's naked.

136
00:09:46.340 --> 00:09:49.490
He took off all his clothes except for his Spanx underwear.

137
00:09:50.780 --> 00:09:53.630
And I look over and I'm like, this really has underwear on.

138
00:09:53.690 --> 00:09:56.960
And it made me happy because that's how you do it. You don't around dude.

139
00:09:57.410 --> 00:10:01.250
You don't change the air conditioning for the guy who's paying for the van.

140
00:10:04.130 --> 00:10:07.070
By the way, Craig was on my side. He was like, I like it hot

141
00:10:12.290 --> 00:10:15.200
anyway, you can't get your air right in the car. What was the deal with that?

142
00:10:15.560 --> 00:10:19.010
Everyone's all excited about Tesla, Prius and all that, bro. Get the air.

143
00:10:19.011 --> 00:10:21.710
Right man. That's when I'll be happy.

144
00:10:24.410 --> 00:10:25.243
Um.

145
00:10:30.500 --> 00:10:31.333
<v 1>So I'm trying to.</v>

146
00:10:33.920 --> 00:10:37.100
<v 0>And I'm cool with my sexuality man, naked dudes in my vans. I don't give a, man.</v>

147
00:10:37.850 --> 00:10:42.110
Dick flopping around don't care. Uh,

148
00:10:44.810 --> 00:10:46.370
Oh man, this made me laugh.

149
00:10:49.610 --> 00:10:53.450
We were in San Diego and

150
00:10:57.200 --> 00:10:59.840
we went to go get a lunch. Me and the three.

151
00:10:59.841 --> 00:11:04.820
I mean the two of us Craig and Mike, we sit down, we're at a bar,

152
00:11:04.821 --> 00:11:08.240
it's got like a bit of a bar menu, find whatever. Okay. I get the Turkey wrap.

153
00:11:08.600 --> 00:11:12.950
It's got a wheat wrap and your boy's trying to keep it healthy. Okay.

154
00:11:12.951 --> 00:11:13.784
It's fine.

155
00:11:17.270 --> 00:11:21.980
Mike goes like this, I'll get the,

156
00:11:22.370 --> 00:11:25.580
uh, the Frank sandwich.

157
00:11:27.290 --> 00:11:31.730
And I say, Oh cool. In my head. And he says, and she says,

158
00:11:32.480 --> 00:11:36.800
okay, writes it down on her pad. And then she, and then Mike says,

159
00:11:37.490 --> 00:11:41.630
is that a cheeseburger? And she says,

160
00:11:42.410 --> 00:11:45.680
yeah, now

161
00:11:47.210 --> 00:11:52.070
we all know. It's not, we all know it's hotdogs

162
00:11:53.710 --> 00:11:58.240
because nobody would ever describe a food as a Frank when it's not a

163
00:11:58.900 --> 00:12:03.400
hot dog. Right. If I was eating a cheeseburger and I said, Hey man,

164
00:12:03.401 --> 00:12:08.290
this ballpark beef, Frank sure is good. You'd say quick,

165
00:12:08.830 --> 00:12:10.600
get that guy to the hospital.

166
00:12:11.980 --> 00:12:14.890
Cause he doesn't know what words are.

167
00:12:16.990 --> 00:12:19.960
All right. So

168
00:12:22.420 --> 00:12:26.110
by the way, what the waitress did was correct.

169
00:12:27.040 --> 00:12:30.340
He said, that's a cheeseburger. Right? And she said, yeah,

170
00:12:31.450 --> 00:12:33.970
because you wouldn't want to make a guy.

171
00:12:34.030 --> 00:12:38.770
Who's obviously lost his mind or broken

172
00:12:38.771 --> 00:12:41.110
his brain upset.

173
00:12:42.400 --> 00:12:43.930
You just agree with crazy people.

174
00:12:44.800 --> 00:12:49.090
It's like when a guy on meth is on the sidewalk and says, you know,

175
00:12:49.120 --> 00:12:52.090
Jesus is coming right. You just say, yeah, yeah, yeah.

176
00:12:54.280 --> 00:12:59.110
So he said, I'll have the Franks. And she said,

177
00:12:59.111 --> 00:13:01.030
great. And he said,

178
00:13:02.530 --> 00:13:04.660
that's a cheeseburger. Right?

179
00:13:06.670 --> 00:13:07.630
And in her head,

180
00:13:07.690 --> 00:13:12.250
this was a crazy guy on meth with his pants around his ankles

181
00:13:12.520 --> 00:13:17.290
saying, you know, Jesus is come right. And that's what I thought too.

182
00:13:17.380 --> 00:13:20.770
I thought, Oh, how sad Mike's brain broke.

183
00:13:22.510 --> 00:13:26.710
Keep it a pay. She said, yes. I wanted to shake her hand.

184
00:13:26.711 --> 00:13:28.090
But I didn't make a big deal.

185
00:13:29.950 --> 00:13:34.660
Now cut to obviously way too long later

186
00:13:34.661 --> 00:13:37.240
because it's a bar and bar food always takes too long.

187
00:13:41.100 --> 00:13:45.630
She puts down two big,

188
00:13:45.960 --> 00:13:48.090
messy hotdogs.

189
00:13:51.510 --> 00:13:56.220
And I look at Mike's face and it's not good.

190
00:13:57.660 --> 00:13:59.700
Not because he's a six,

191
00:13:59.730 --> 00:14:04.680
but because his face did something like what the she leaves? And he says,

192
00:14:04.920 --> 00:14:09.120
Oh, I didn't want this. And I said, huh.

193
00:14:11.010 --> 00:14:13.350
And he says, I thought it was a cheeseburger.

194
00:14:15.480 --> 00:14:18.600
And I said, huh. And he said,

195
00:14:18.780 --> 00:14:22.530
did you see me ask if it was a cheeseburger? And I say, yeah.

196
00:14:24.330 --> 00:14:28.260
And then she said, yes, it was a cheeseburger. And I said course.

197
00:14:29.880 --> 00:14:33.960
And he said, but it's hot and talks. And I said, yeah.

198
00:14:34.440 --> 00:14:35.273
<v 1>Cars.</v>

199
00:14:36.480 --> 00:14:39.690
<v 0>And he said, why did you say it was a cheeseburger? And I said,</v>

200
00:14:40.470 --> 00:14:41.840
because your brain's broken.

201
00:14:45.420 --> 00:14:46.980
<v 1>You order Franks.</v>

202
00:14:49.380 --> 00:14:52.010
<v 0>You order some ballpark racks.</v>

203
00:14:53.810 --> 00:14:57.290
You asked if it was a cheeseburger. She said yes,

204
00:14:57.740 --> 00:15:01.880
because she didn't want to deal with you taking your Dick out or some and all

205
00:15:01.881 --> 00:15:04.580
over the table. Cause y'all obviously crazy pers

206
00:15:10.340 --> 00:15:13.460
Hey dude, I'll get the ballpark. But Hey dude,

207
00:15:13.670 --> 00:15:18.530
I'll get the ballpark beef Franks. Okay. Is that a salad?

208
00:15:19.100 --> 00:15:23.780
Yes. Great. Here you go.

209
00:15:24.470 --> 00:15:29.240
Oh, what the? This isn't a salad. No, you.

210
00:15:31.460 --> 00:15:36.230
It says Frank's your 36.

211
00:15:39.740 --> 00:15:43.190
He ate it. He ate the whole thing.

212
00:15:43.520 --> 00:15:45.710
You know why fat slob.

213
00:15:46.550 --> 00:15:50.660
That's why that's also why it's too hot in the sprinter van.

214
00:15:51.470 --> 00:15:54.860
You know, it's all your fault, man. Nothing on this. Nothing on this one.

215
00:15:54.920 --> 00:15:57.370
<v 2>I guess it's my fault. It's never been my fault. I've never, ever,</v>

216
00:15:57.550 --> 00:15:58.450
I've never had my fault.

217
00:16:01.510 --> 00:16:01.960
<v 0>Anyway.</v>
