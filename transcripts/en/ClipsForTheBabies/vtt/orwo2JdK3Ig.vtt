I never watch it and I thought it would be a good thing to watch with you. Um,

00:00:40.431 --> 00:00:42.860
the way they try to lie as the best, I was watching one,

10
00:00:43.370 --> 00:00:47.870

00:00:51.350 --> 00:00:53.600
Had Saturday night in the Connecticut. First of all, dude,

13
00:00:54.440 --> 00:00:58.310
how many syllables does the word? It have it's Saturday.

14
00:00:58.311 --> 00:01:02.720
And it IELTS you Saturday night

15
00:01:03.290 --> 00:01:07.040

I mean the way and this guy pizza. Uh, so,

17
00:01:12.051 --> 00:01:16.400
so far nothing, this guy is bringing pizza to little or lend.

18
00:01:16.401 --> 00:01:21.140
It looks like Robocop is looking at them, look at this text.

19
00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:24.860
But I don't understand that these guys text these things to who they think is a

20
00:01:24.861 --> 00:01:27.740
13 year old, you know, I could be put in jail.

21
00:01:27.741 --> 00:01:32.210
If the police found out we were intimate sin criminal. That is,

22
00:01:32.211 --> 00:01:37.100
that is the worst thing to text someone. Yeah, because that means that, okay.

23
00:01:37.101 --> 00:01:40.610
So, you know, you're no, yeah, you can't what you're doing is really bad. Yeah.

24
00:01:40.670 --> 00:01:44.570
Dude, this guy is essay and secure when he gets caught. Dude. It's unbelievable.

25
00:01:44.571 --> 00:01:49.520
So dude, he is there and she thinks she's 13 years old.

26
00:01:49.640 --> 00:01:53.900
She's laying it on thick and she's laying on thick too. She's like 20 something,

27
00:01:54.110 --> 00:01:57.680
you know? And she's like ma killing it, do an acting. In the meantime,

28
00:01:57.710 --> 00:01:59.300
if I was in this situation, which I'd never be,

29
00:01:59.301 --> 00:02:01.220
I would never be in this situation. I would be like,

30
00:02:01.400 --> 00:02:03.880
she's laying it on too thick. That's a girl who's been to acting class.

31
00:02:03.930 --> 00:02:07.340
She's 22. But this guy is hoping so much that it's for real,

32
00:02:07.970 --> 00:02:09.290
like a perf Bryce.

33
00:02:15.320 --> 00:02:19.190
<v 1>So nervous. Wow. No expectations whatsoever now.</v>

34
00:02:19.910 --> 00:02:23.990
Oh, look at the guy. He says no, but look, well,

35
00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:28.850
look what she comes out and look when he comes in You're Jeff,

36
00:02:28.851 --> 00:02:30.390
right? Yeah.

37
00:02:32.270 --> 00:02:34.370
<v 0>Like, like he's the dummy. Yeah.</v>

38
00:02:35.810 --> 00:02:40.090
<v 1>Hanging out, hanging out with him, with our food.</v>

39
00:02:43.500 --> 00:02:44.900
I want to know who you are.

40
00:02:46.670 --> 00:02:48.980
<v 0>Flipped right back the way he takes the water. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Yeah.</v>

41
00:02:49.340 --> 00:02:51.860
So nervous to grab water like that.

42
00:02:54.680 --> 00:02:55.190
What are you doing?

43
00:02:55.190 --> 00:02:58.580
<v 1>You here tonight. Jeff hanging out with the way he grew up to water. Yeah,</v>

44
00:02:59.650 --> 00:03:00.483
because he has to do something

45
00:03:06.280 --> 00:03:07.930
a little bit more about you first.

46
00:03:11.250 --> 00:03:12.083
You first.

47
00:03:16.560 --> 00:03:19.320
<v 0>Ah, could I eat? Can I eat first? And then he goes, sure.</v>

48
00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:24.570
He's so relaxed and convinced of his innocence. He eats a slice of.

49
00:03:24.690 --> 00:03:27.120
<v 1>Pizza. Come in. Who you are is, you know,</v>

50
00:03:30.180 --> 00:03:30.890
relaxing.

51
00:03:30.890 --> 00:03:33.420
<v 0>He is bumbling so hard with the pizza dude.</v>

52
00:03:33.930 --> 00:03:38.370
It's so weird that this guy chose to eat pizza. And this is the weirdest,

53
00:03:38.550 --> 00:03:40.110
weirdest thing.

54
00:03:40.920 --> 00:03:44.910
Also for any of these to act like they don't know who Chris Hanson is. Yeah.

55
00:03:44.911 --> 00:03:47.100
I don't know. Maybe this was nice. This wasn't a while ago. I don't know.

56
00:03:47.101 --> 00:03:47.611
I don't get it.

57
00:03:47.611 --> 00:03:50.520
Boston man drives two and a half hours to Connecticut to bring pizza to a 13

58
00:03:50.521 --> 00:03:53.520
year old girl that meets Chris Hanson instead said basics direct to the point.

59
00:03:55.350 --> 00:03:59.130
<v 1>Didn't know there would be other people here. No, man. Well,</v>

60
00:03:59.131 --> 00:04:00.300
what did you expect to happen?

61
00:04:03.180 --> 00:04:04.260
Didn't have any expectations.

62
00:04:04.830 --> 00:04:07.890
<v 0>Oh, well you, definitely expected to eat some pizza. I'll tell you that much.</v>

63
00:04:07.910 --> 00:04:08.743
Yeah.

64
00:04:10.890 --> 00:04:15.580
<v 1>So you drove two and a half hours. Sure. It did from Boston. I like it.</v>

65
00:04:15.650 --> 00:04:17.460
<v 0>We own certain parts of it. You know,</v>

66
00:04:18.240 --> 00:04:21.330
did not a crime against driving two and a half hours is there. Right?

67
00:04:30.210 --> 00:04:34.590
Dude taking the pizza. The cheese is connected from the end to the pizza.

68
00:04:34.591 --> 00:04:37.470
Can't get it off and just relaxes into it and says,

69
00:04:39.120 --> 00:04:43.980
who are you? Is the most balling?

70
00:04:44.310 --> 00:04:47.250
Like I actually think he could maybe get away with it with that.

71
00:04:47.460 --> 00:04:51.930
If he was just that. I mean, he's just like, listen guys,

72
00:04:51.960 --> 00:04:56.700
let's cut to the chase. Who are you? Pizza dude. Well,

73
00:04:56.701 --> 00:04:58.380
he gets caught being a pedophile. I know.

74
00:04:58.410 --> 00:05:01.410
Well what else is he going to do at this point? He's. Yeah.

75
00:05:01.440 --> 00:05:05.490
You have to just eat the at least enjoy the pizza. I guess last meal. Yeah.

76
00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:09.360
<v 1>Your dad to meet a young girl and you work on, we'll get to that in a minute.</v>

77
00:05:10.530 --> 00:05:14.850
Look at, go ahead and have a bite. Sokol probably should have brought napkins.

78
00:05:15.660 --> 00:05:19.590
<v 0>A demon dude. Yeah.</v>

79
00:05:19.770 --> 00:05:24.720
Eating pizza gets caught being a pedophile and is like just munching on

80
00:05:24.721 --> 00:05:28.740
pizza like that too. Getting it like a slopped.

81
00:05:30.030 --> 00:05:34.470
<v 1>Somebody what's wrong. Is that to meet a young girl? He has against the law.</v>

82
00:05:35.370 --> 00:05:37.740
Yeah. Is after this camp, how

83
00:05:39.840 --> 00:05:44.100
did you bring some kind of a contract with you? Some sort of marriage contract.

84
00:05:44.160 --> 00:05:46.620
You had a marriage contract with him that he wanted her to sign. Look,

85
00:05:46.710 --> 00:05:50.790
it looked like a laughing at familiar while you enjoy your pizza, slammed him.

86
00:05:50.850 --> 00:05:55.800
I should come see Saturday. Since your mom isn't home.

87
00:05:55.830 --> 00:05:59.420
It's the best time to do it. I would. But only if you want me to,

88
00:06:01.850 --> 00:06:06.560
I mean, eating the pizza is making me hungry. I can't go to jail.

89
00:06:06.890 --> 00:06:08.450
My life would be ruined. Right.

90
00:06:09.440 --> 00:06:13.660
<v 0>Right, right. That sounds like me. That sounds like me. Right. Right.</v>

91
00:06:13.661 --> 00:06:17.590
I see you do a great, that can't go to jail. Life will be ruined. Wow.

92
00:06:17.591 --> 00:06:19.690
That was a good one. Got to see if we can get that.

93
00:06:20.680 --> 00:06:23.950
<v 1>My life would be ruined. Right? It could be like that for 20 years.</v>

94
00:06:24.370 --> 00:06:28.990
<v 0>Yup. Yup. That's about it. Could we like over 20 years? Yeah. Yeah.</v>

95
00:06:31.180 --> 00:06:35.770
Oh wow. I can see why, you know, a girl would like this guy,

96
00:06:36.230 --> 00:06:37.030
just his confidence.

97
00:06:37.030 --> 00:06:40.920
<v 1>You say, do you trim your blank? Okay.</v>

98
00:06:41.550 --> 00:06:44.740
<v 0>Oh yeah. It was okay. It sounds like me too. Yeah. Okay. Okay.</v>

99
00:06:44.800 --> 00:06:46.420
I'm gonna bring that up. Okay, great. You gonna bring that up?

100
00:06:49.430 --> 00:06:53.320
<v 1>That scroll is 13, right? One chart.</v>

101
00:06:55.050 --> 00:06:57.130
<v 0>Uh, wow. Wasn't sure. So he says it wasn't you.</v>

102
00:06:57.730 --> 00:07:01.570
<v 1>How old are you? Might as well just tell me.</v>

103
00:07:01.690 --> 00:07:06.040
Cause I can find doc like that. Who are you? Can you tell me who you are first?

104
00:07:07.180 --> 00:07:12.040
I will tell you that. Cause you know, now you're, you're making me nervous and.

105
00:07:12.790 --> 00:07:15.910
<v 0>Oh yeah. You're making me want to stop eating my pizza.</v>

106
00:07:16.450 --> 00:07:21.360
Kind of losing my appetite. Honestly. He's pieces of pizza,

107
00:07:21.480 --> 00:07:26.470
eating housing, that pizza two and a half hour drive housing.

108
00:07:26.471 --> 00:07:31.270
That pizza. What? I mean housing? Yeah. housing days.

109
00:07:32.350 --> 00:07:33.460
it's like around,

110
00:07:33.480 --> 00:07:37.360
around like a tree trimmer or like a where they call them free.

111
00:07:37.390 --> 00:07:38.880
What do you call it? Log cutter.

112
00:07:39.730 --> 00:07:42.640
<v 1>Talking to 13 year old girls like this and I want to,</v>

113
00:07:44.410 --> 00:07:45.640
what am I supposed to make of that?

114
00:07:51.970 --> 00:07:56.230
Sorry for meeting me. No, potentially having.

115
00:07:56.740 --> 00:08:00.880
<v 0>Oh, okay. So I mean stint, first of all, I don't understand these guys.</v>

116
00:08:00.910 --> 00:08:05.050
When this guy shows up, how do you not believe Matt broke the set?

117
00:08:06.610 --> 00:08:10.150
How do you not leave immediately back?

118
00:08:10.810 --> 00:08:15.250
Just leave when that happens immediately. Ah right.

119
00:08:15.610 --> 00:08:18.970
I'm hungry. Uh, yes. I don't know, dude. I don't. I don't.

120
00:08:19.060 --> 00:08:22.660
Well he's he's so he is so

121
00:08:23.920 --> 00:08:26.530
scared. Well of course he is. Well obviously,

122
00:08:26.531 --> 00:08:30.220
but that's that explains every weird, up stupid thing he's doing.

123
00:08:30.430 --> 00:08:33.640
Like his brain is clearly not working. He knows it's Chris Hanson. Right?

124
00:08:34.270 --> 00:08:37.780
He knows how he is. He knows he's never going to eat a pizza again and his life.

125
00:08:37.930 --> 00:08:38.763
Right.

126
00:08:38.950 --> 00:08:42.370
Where that's all he's going to be eating or that's all he's going to be eating.

127
00:08:42.460 --> 00:08:45.640
And now I can't stop thinking about how my voice is sounding like that.

128
00:08:46.330 --> 00:08:49.780
Or hat's all he's going to be eating from now on,

129
00:08:49.781 --> 00:08:53.950
in jail. You know, she's 13, don't you? I,

130
00:08:54.070 --> 00:08:58.230
I have it right here. What you mentioned with, tell me who are you?

131
00:08:58.770 --> 00:09:03.330
I will get to that. I'll let you know when,

132
00:09:03.810 --> 00:09:07.110
why won't Chris Hansen tell him who he is because he,

133
00:09:07.160 --> 00:09:10.920
he knows once he tells him that, that who he is and who he's with.

134
00:09:10.950 --> 00:09:13.890
I think I was going to leave and he wants to get good television.

135
00:09:13.891 --> 00:09:17.150
So it's just entertainment value. But also Chris Hansen,

136
00:09:17.180 --> 00:09:20.870
didn't he have some come out about him. Now. You didn't know about this.

137
00:09:20.871 --> 00:09:24.980
Did yeah. Chris Hanson, uh,

138
00:09:25.160 --> 00:09:27.830
what would I call it? Uh, what would I type in

139
00:09:30.470 --> 00:09:35.420
bounced? A bunch of checks really? Oh, I thought you meant like, no, no, no.

140
00:09:35.450 --> 00:09:39.350
He did. He had some like some other stuff. Uh, Oh wow.

141
00:09:39.740 --> 00:09:43.250
<v 2>I looked up one of the investigations and like 26 dudes that they had arrested</v>

142
00:09:44.120 --> 00:09:45.350
26 or something, right?

143
00:09:45.410 --> 00:09:47.390
<v 0>No, he it up and they went free.</v>

144
00:09:48.050 --> 00:09:52.460
But also I thought he had his own things where he was like trying to

145
00:09:54.080 --> 00:09:56.810
come up front man or something. Not, no, you're not young girls,

146
00:09:56.811 --> 00:09:59.180
but now maybe I just made that up. I probably just made it up.

147
00:09:59.181 --> 00:10:03.800
I don't want to say that this is a story and I will never ever watch this

148
00:10:03.801 --> 00:10:05.030
YouTube video that begins like that.

149
00:10:05.031 --> 00:10:09.710
So nevermind hate when a video says it's a thing. Yeah, dude.

150
00:10:10.760 --> 00:10:15.560
Just introducing it. Yep. Get you out of there. Yeah. Get your view. Count up.

151
00:10:15.620 --> 00:10:17.570
Why are you in the video of Chris Hanson?

152
00:10:17.990 --> 00:10:20.660
It'll be like new MNM song and you'd be like click and be like, what's up,
