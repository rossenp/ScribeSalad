00:00:00.900 --> 00:00:04.680
<v 0>Arnett sunglasses. Remember those sunglasses dude,</v>

2
00:00:05.220 --> 00:00:09.660
I wore our nets and I swear to God when I put our net or our MP,

3
00:00:09.670 --> 00:00:14.100
some would call them RNs because they thought it was like foreign.

4
00:00:14.101 --> 00:00:17.100
And even if it is our needs, it's not. It's our nets in America.

5
00:00:17.130 --> 00:00:21.060
That's how we're doing it. And I had these green Arnett sunglasses, bro.

6
00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:24.060
You think I don't have the feeling I have right now.

7
00:00:24.061 --> 00:00:28.230
I can nostalgically feel the feeling of having the Arnett sunglasses on.

8
00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:32.370
I felt like I felt, I felt, you know what? I felt like,

9
00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:38.850
That's how I felt. They'd be like, Chris, are you going to go to,

10
00:00:39.630 --> 00:00:41.610
are you going to go get a bagel with us? And I'd be like, yeah.

11
00:00:41.780 --> 00:00:45.590
<v 1>Sorry, you guys, I have English class.</v>

12
00:00:48.650 --> 00:00:51.860
<v 0>And I put on my sunglasses dude, they were green and they were a little shiny.</v>

13
00:00:52.430 --> 00:00:54.740
And then my uncle gave me a little shot for wearing them. And I was like,

14
00:00:54.741 --> 00:00:59.570
I'm about one way. I'm all that long. You know that much anymore. Oh,

15
00:00:59.600 --> 00:01:02.750
post Malone has a deal with our net. Jesus, they're still around,

16
00:01:04.040 --> 00:01:08.060
but they don't look like they used to. I mean, they used to look sick in 1998.

17
00:01:09.410 --> 00:01:11.660
You can. I don't think you can wear Arnet, sunglasses,

18
00:01:11.720 --> 00:01:14.030
those kinds without putting gel in your hair. For real dude,

19
00:01:14.060 --> 00:01:17.510
Asians had five or six Arnett, sunglasses.

20
00:01:17.900 --> 00:01:19.940
You weren't technically Asian.

21
00:01:19.941 --> 00:01:23.690
If you didn't have all a bunch of Arnett sunglasses,

22
00:01:23.720 --> 00:01:28.070
and then also drove a Acura Integra for real.

23
00:01:29.060 --> 00:01:33.530
And also Asians either have a picture of themselves

24
00:01:34.160 --> 00:01:38.570
on the dash hanging from the, uh, what do you call it? The rear view mirror,

25
00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:42.380
not the rear view mirror or they have a picture of them and their car in their

26
00:01:42.381 --> 00:01:46.610
wallet. That's how it was in the nineties either. Or if you didn't, you weren't,

27
00:01:46.640 --> 00:01:49.640
you were, you were like secretly, Indiana. You know what I mean?

28
00:01:49.641 --> 00:01:52.580
I know that's over there, but like you were not, you were not Korean.

29
00:01:52.581 --> 00:01:56.660
Like there's no way Korean either have a picture of them on their rear view

30
00:01:56.661 --> 00:02:00.470
mirror in their car or a picture of them

31
00:02:01.730 --> 00:02:04.670
and their car in their wallet. And that's that? That's that?

32
00:02:04.671 --> 00:02:09.260
And I don't make these rules, dude. Oh yeah. Oh yeah. Uh,

33
00:02:09.290 --> 00:02:13.370
our nets. Yeah, our nets. Um, yeah, they were the.

34
00:02:13.700 --> 00:02:18.110
I had the feeling of it. Sometimes you can feel that used to happen. I had to,

35
00:02:18.140 --> 00:02:21.080
I used to, I don't wear cologne. You know that because there's no Kirk cologne.

36
00:02:21.081 --> 00:02:21.914
There's just perfume.

37
00:02:22.100 --> 00:02:25.040
And if you put on and if you're a man and you put on cologne, congratulations,

38
00:02:25.340 --> 00:02:28.250
you're a female that put on perfume and that's all good. We're not judging,

39
00:02:29.840 --> 00:02:33.920
but turn around. Let's go on a date, dude. That's all good. Hey bro,

40
00:02:34.130 --> 00:02:37.340
you wore cologne. All good. What are you doing later?

41
00:02:38.480 --> 00:02:41.390
It's all good. And I don't and I don't judge you,

42
00:02:42.050 --> 00:02:43.880
but would you like to go to a movie sometime?

43
00:02:45.920 --> 00:02:49.820
<v 1>Hey, Hey guy, or.</v>

44
00:02:49.910 --> 00:02:52.580
<v 0>Good spray what you want on your neck?</v>

45
00:02:53.600 --> 00:02:58.490
My only question is, would you like to go to a matinee sometime

46
00:03:04.390 --> 00:03:07.750
because there's no, because it's more fume and I'll be inside you later,

47
00:03:07.751 --> 00:03:12.740
maybe in a few dates. Uh, so, so yeah, so I,

48
00:03:12.741 --> 00:03:16.570
I used to, when I was a kid, you know,

49
00:03:16.571 --> 00:03:20.440
I would still try and spray cologne. I'd try, you know, I figure myself out.

50
00:03:21.370 --> 00:03:23.860
I had the Arnett sunglasses and I had two colognes that were the.

51
00:03:24.160 --> 00:03:27.160
I tried three cold water cologne. Didn't really like it.

52
00:03:27.820 --> 00:03:31.540
Then I tried Fahrenheit that, every time I smell it now,

53
00:03:31.570 --> 00:03:35.590
even still that sends me back, dude, I love Fahrenheit. That smell is the.

54
00:03:35.890 --> 00:03:40.030
But only because it's nostalgic and that there was an old

55
00:03:40.690 --> 00:03:44.740
one that I don't think is around anymore. It might be, but it was called Pocco.

56
00:03:46.030 --> 00:03:48.190
And I got that because my friend, Brendan goodie got it. And he was like,

57
00:03:48.191 --> 00:03:51.160
it's the? And he was kind of good with chick. So I was like, I'll get Pocco

58
00:03:52.690 --> 00:03:56.050
girls will be slipping and falling all over the place. All need to get up.

59
00:03:56.290 --> 00:04:00.970
I I'll get Pocco. I'm taller than Brendan. My them Brandon, my,

60
00:04:01.030 --> 00:04:04.600
my, my shoulders. They, you know,

61
00:04:04.601 --> 00:04:08.980
they travel out the distance and Brandon's were way closer to his ears.

62
00:04:09.130 --> 00:04:10.870
Therefore I'll have to,

63
00:04:10.960 --> 00:04:14.860
I'll have to get Pako at target because I'm also going to have to pick up some

64
00:04:14.861 --> 00:04:19.630
towels for the girls in a sand. Um,

65
00:04:20.710 --> 00:04:25.180
so I got Pocco and he was still better with chicks, but, um, uh,

66
00:04:25.210 --> 00:04:28.000
I got Pako and then I got, uh, and then I got, uh,

67
00:04:28.060 --> 00:04:31.120
and I got Fahrenheit and those were the and cold water. Cool water.

68
00:04:31.180 --> 00:04:32.980
Cool water is what it was not cold water.

69
00:04:33.010 --> 00:04:36.760
That's that's that's a street in the Valley. Cool. Water, cool water. Cause uh,

70
00:04:36.790 --> 00:04:40.330
Snoop used to, you used to rap about that. Um,

71
00:04:41.800 --> 00:04:45.580
anyway, and then, and then I was like, what the am I doing, dude?

72
00:04:47.320 --> 00:04:51.790
You know, you gotta figure out who you, who you are, you really do. And uh,

73
00:04:52.270 --> 00:04:54.520
and you gotta make some mistakes and that's okay.

74
00:04:54.880 --> 00:04:57.070
That's how you figure out who you are and you gotta keep making mistakes too.

75
00:04:57.071 --> 00:04:58.960
You can't, you know,

76
00:05:00.520 --> 00:05:03.340
I think changing your mind is a good thing for sure. For sure.

77
00:05:03.610 --> 00:05:06.700
And I made a mistake with Pocco and I made a mistake with, you know,

78
00:05:06.701 --> 00:05:09.490
Fahrenheit still smells good, but I made a mistake, um,

79
00:05:09.820 --> 00:05:14.530
because he can't put cologne on if you're just, you know, you can,

80
00:05:14.531 --> 00:05:18.190
but it's perfume and you're a woman and it's all good. And it's all good. Um,

81
00:05:19.270 --> 00:05:23.200
so yeah, so our net sunglasses, I'd love to see some now,

82
00:05:23.350 --> 00:05:26.350
just some new Arnett sunglasses. I've never, I haven't seen him in a long time,

83
00:05:26.351 --> 00:05:29.470
but it doesn't really matter that much. Uh, by the way,

84
00:05:29.471 --> 00:05:32.350
you can probably get them. I wonder if they had a much sunglass hut.

85
00:05:32.380 --> 00:05:34.510
I thought it was sunglasses had, I didn't see that. What does this say?

86
00:05:34.720 --> 00:05:36.670
Sunglasses? I thought it was sunglasses hot,

87
00:05:38.050 --> 00:05:41.290
but it's sunglass hot and it should be,

88
00:05:42.820 --> 00:05:47.260
it should be, it should be sunglasses hot. I figured that out.

89
00:05:49.450 --> 00:05:54.280
I figured that out. So yeah. You know, and that's it.

90
00:05:54.910 --> 00:05:59.210
My girl was laughing at me cause she was like, it's sunglass,

91
00:05:59.240 --> 00:06:02.450
it's sunglass hut. And I was like, well, it shouldn't be, and it shouldn't be,

92
00:06:02.780 --> 00:06:07.700
it should be sunglasses hut because it's not a hut made out of sunglasses.

93
00:06:08.270 --> 00:06:12.740
That would be sunglass hut. That would be sunglass hut,

94
00:06:13.730 --> 00:06:18.560
mud hut, right? Mud, mud hut.

95
00:06:19.190 --> 00:06:21.500
What other kind of HUD is there? I don't know if there's only a mud hut,

96
00:06:22.190 --> 00:06:25.100
straw hut, sunglass hut.

97
00:06:25.800 --> 00:06:29.830
I'm going to go into a sunglass hut and be like, Hey, what's the deal?

98
00:06:30.910 --> 00:06:33.940
You guys lie, dude. W w w w w what? These walls

99
00:06:38.080 --> 00:06:42.490
it sunglasses hut. Because there are sunglasses in the hut. It's also not a hut.

100
00:06:45.010 --> 00:06:48.580
They should call it sunglasses mall room,

101
00:06:49.990 --> 00:06:54.700
sunglasses store. It's a sunglasses store. Dude.

102
00:06:54.701 --> 00:06:57.160
Sunglass hut, dude. Don't try and be cute with me.

103
00:06:57.161 --> 00:06:58.660
You think when I go to Denny's I get, I,

104
00:06:59.080 --> 00:07:03.190
I look at the waiter in the eyes and I say, I'll take the moons over my hammy,

105
00:07:03.400 --> 00:07:04.233
eat my.

106
00:07:05.020 --> 00:07:09.640
No way would I ever say that dude eat my whole,

107
00:07:11.410 --> 00:07:14.260
dude. I say, I want this one. If that's what I want.

108
00:07:14.470 --> 00:07:19.150
And hopefully the waiter's not blind because I'm not getting it. If she is, Oh,

109
00:07:19.210 --> 00:07:23.530
well, what is that, sir? I'm blind. Oh, give me a Turkey sandwich for sake,

110
00:07:23.531 --> 00:07:26.320
dude. I'm going to get the two cam.

111
00:07:27.910 --> 00:07:31.690
No dude. Denny's now look,

112
00:07:31.900 --> 00:07:34.060
I'm a big fan of Denny's you know that? Cause I hand out.

113
00:07:34.061 --> 00:07:36.850
So I hand out Gris names all day long, right?

114
00:07:37.750 --> 00:07:40.210
I hand out to grand stamps to Mark Walberg in my head.

115
00:07:40.210 --> 00:07:43.510
I've got them stored in case I'm on transformers nine,

116
00:07:46.150 --> 00:07:50.620
but dude, you know like

117
00:07:52.330 --> 00:07:56.890
Denny's are you going to make me say moons over my hammy?

118
00:07:56.891 --> 00:07:59.380
That's the thing about Denny's is, you know, there's some,

119
00:07:59.410 --> 00:08:01.000
either guy in a borderlands,

120
00:08:01.180 --> 00:08:04.210
like there were think of something cute marketing or they're like,

121
00:08:04.211 --> 00:08:06.910
let's with everyone and make them have to say moons over my hammy

122
00:08:08.410 --> 00:08:11.290
or even knows what moons over Miami moon over Miami. What is it?

123
00:08:11.291 --> 00:08:14.950
It was that like a song or something moon over Miami. That sounds like some,

124
00:08:15.970 --> 00:08:19.720
Frank Sinatra would sing. And also everyone else would sing too.

125
00:08:19.721 --> 00:08:22.000
Like there would be the Dean Martin version of the Frank Sinatra version,

126
00:08:22.150 --> 00:08:23.620
the Sammy Davis Jr version.

127
00:08:23.770 --> 00:08:26.740
And then the other guys that look like just date with a date,

128
00:08:26.741 --> 00:08:31.570
rape looking one on the rat pack moon over Miami and

129
00:08:31.571 --> 00:08:36.250
your eye please. Oh, it's talking about eyes in those old songs.

130
00:08:36.670 --> 00:08:41.260
What is it? Moon Ray. What's a song. Ray. Charles. See,

131
00:08:41.290 --> 00:08:46.000
there you go. Moon. Over my enemy.

132
00:08:48.250 --> 00:08:51.850
They're such a chauvinistically song too. No doubt. Secretly. Yeah.

133
00:08:51.910 --> 00:08:54.460
Moon over Miami

134
00:08:57.690 --> 00:09:01.200
women. Don't count Brown. [inaudible]

135
00:09:04.170 --> 00:09:06.060
Hey there you shut up.

136
00:09:06.420 --> 00:09:10.890
God that moon over my army in the Moonlight.

137
00:09:10.891 --> 00:09:12.360
I can tell you that you're less than me.
