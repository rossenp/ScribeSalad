WEBVTT

1
00:00:00.180 --> 00:00:01.830
<v 0>And then, and then Minneapolis shoot my special.</v>

2
00:00:01.831 --> 00:00:05.250
I did my show last night at the Hollywood improv. And, um,

3
00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:09.350
I did my hour and I'm very excited about it. And, uh, and I,

4
00:00:09.351 --> 00:00:11.310
I F I didn't do it in maybe like a month.

5
00:00:11.550 --> 00:00:15.660
And I finally did it now that I'm done with this movie, uh, I'm able to do,

6
00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:20.280
I'm able to get the reps in and do my, and do my set, uh, uh,

7
00:00:20.310 --> 00:00:22.140
before I shoot it. And, uh,

8
00:00:22.440 --> 00:00:25.290
I did it last night and I went and when Varo and I'm very excited and I got

9
00:00:25.291 --> 00:00:28.650
rejuvenated. Have you ever been rejuvenated? It feels good, man.

10
00:00:31.020 --> 00:00:35.610
Um, one time with one of my exes, she would be like, she would be like,

11
00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:39.960
let me, let me get a kiss. And then I kiss her and then like a golden one.

12
00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:43.410
And then she would be like, Oh, I'm rejuvenated. And that's cute.

13
00:00:43.411 --> 00:00:48.090
And that's just a cute story for you, dude. Was it my ex-wife? Yes.

14
00:00:48.091 --> 00:00:51.830
Did we get divorced? Yes. Am I at divorce? Yes. Is it weird to think of that?

15
00:00:51.831 --> 00:00:56.240
About yourself? Yes. Even at such a young age. I'm 39. Yeah, it's weird,

16
00:00:58.160 --> 00:01:02.540
but that's it, dude. It's all good, man. This is real life.

17
00:01:02.810 --> 00:01:05.450
And if you're divorced out there, Cole

18
00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:11.570
divorce has a negative connotation. It's the to be divorced. Do it.

19
00:01:11.660 --> 00:01:13.640
It really is. It really is.

20
00:01:13.970 --> 00:01:16.130
You ain't until you're married once and you divorced.

21
00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:19.850
Cause then you know what the life is all about, man. You know what life is?

22
00:01:20.270 --> 00:01:22.820
When you get divorced, dude, you know what marriage is?

23
00:01:22.821 --> 00:01:26.180
You don't know what it is, how come you never know what is until it's over.

24
00:01:26.570 --> 00:01:31.520
You don't, you don't know. You ever see a movie. And you're like, Whoa,

25
00:01:31.521 --> 00:01:36.050
that movie reps. And then a week later, you're like, I don't really remember it.

26
00:01:36.080 --> 00:01:39.740
It's because you, you didn't know what it was until afterwards, baby.

27
00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:44.690
I know what it is now, dude, what if I was saying that?

28
00:01:44.691 --> 00:01:49.430
And just tears were streaming down my face. Um, so yeah. Yeah,

29
00:01:49.460 --> 00:01:50.293
dude,

30
00:01:50.870 --> 00:01:55.430
but life continues to rip,

31
00:01:56.120 --> 00:02:01.070
right? It does. Life happens. Okay.

32
00:02:01.250 --> 00:02:04.880
Now that's something that would just be on a stupid coffee mug that a girl would

33
00:02:04.881 --> 00:02:08.330
post on Instagram with quote unquote, messy hair and quote unquote,

34
00:02:08.360 --> 00:02:11.630
no makeup with her eyes rolled up to the side.

35
00:02:11.750 --> 00:02:14.480
Just like Mondays. That would be the caption.

36
00:02:14.720 --> 00:02:19.700
And it would say life happens in some kind of squiggly writing with like

37
00:02:19.701 --> 00:02:23.060
a stupid border around it, on the coffee. Now would that be? Yeah,

38
00:02:23.120 --> 00:02:26.330
that would be, that would exist. Life happens.

39
00:02:26.450 --> 00:02:30.500
But what we have to remember is once you past

40
00:02:31.520 --> 00:02:35.060
this situation, rejuvenation, babies,

41
00:02:35.330 --> 00:02:37.400
and life rips again,

42
00:02:39.530 --> 00:02:43.640
life rips again. Now could that also be the title of the show? Yes. Well,

43
00:02:43.641 --> 00:02:48.260
I forget it. Yes, but life rips again, dude.

44
00:02:48.800 --> 00:02:52.160
And that's why I put these life's life rips hoodies,

45
00:02:52.161 --> 00:02:56.510
and t-shirts out there that you can get to support this podcast.

46
00:02:56.600 --> 00:03:01.000
So we keep eating. So we came Pete and dude,

47
00:03:04.080 --> 00:03:07.110
you want to get a, you want to,

48
00:03:07.170 --> 00:03:11.190
you want to get some merch so I can keep eating these Turkey sandwiches.

00:03:14.040 --> 00:03:17.580
You click the buy, you click the purchase,

50
00:03:19.440 --> 00:03:22.680
uh, icon on my website. And it's like,

51
00:03:22.740 --> 00:03:27.420
I'm practically going nom, nom, nom. That's it.

52
00:03:28.230 --> 00:03:29.400
You're clicking the maiden.

53
00:03:32.070 --> 00:03:32.280
<v 1>So.</v>

54
00:03:32.280 --> 00:03:36.420
<v 0>You click it. And when you click buy or purchase and you click,</v>

55
00:03:36.870 --> 00:03:40.350
you know, next day air or whatever the it is when you click that,

56
00:03:40.351 --> 00:03:43.110
I want you to imagine me going nom, nom.

57
00:03:48.300 --> 00:03:48.930
<v 1>This cult.</v>

58
00:03:48.930 --> 00:03:51.210
<v 0>Leader, is serious business dude.</v>

59
00:03:53.880 --> 00:03:55.980
And I, and I said, I wouldn't say his name. And I'm never going to say,

60
00:03:55.981 --> 00:04:00.540
I would never say his name on this podcast. But Jared Leto is not a cult leader.

61
00:04:00.630 --> 00:04:04.830
That's a celebrity dude, me cult leader.

62
00:04:06.050 --> 00:04:06.660
<v 1>The guys walking.</v>

63
00:04:06.660 --> 00:04:09.750
<v 0>Around with robes and. He turned me off a robes, man.</v>

64
00:04:10.110 --> 00:04:14.700
He turned me off a robes dude. I was going to wear all white and this dude,

65
00:04:15.030 --> 00:04:18.180
Jared Leto. And I don't even, I'm not going to say I don't say his name,

66
00:04:18.181 --> 00:04:22.080
but dude, the fact that that dude is walking around in white robes,

67
00:04:22.170 --> 00:04:26.820
like what this boy was going to do, dude, the youngest men alive me.

68
00:04:26.880 --> 00:04:29.640
I was going to make this call and this dude walks around,

69
00:04:29.790 --> 00:04:31.350
but he's serious about it.

70
00:04:35.310 --> 00:04:36.020
<v 1>You know what it's like.</v>

71
00:04:36.020 --> 00:04:39.660
<v 0>Dude. It's like when Tupac had the in a here's what?</v>

72
00:04:39.661 --> 00:04:43.620
Another reason why I'm just like Tupac dude. It's like when Tupac had the,

73
00:04:44.790 --> 00:04:45.251
uh, he,

74
00:04:45.251 --> 00:04:48.450
he was like obsessed with death and he wanted to make the album with the death

75
00:04:48.451 --> 00:04:51.480
and and death around the corner and. That's when,

76
00:04:52.920 --> 00:04:56.040
and then biggie came out with ready to die. And Tupac was like, what the?

77
00:04:56.550 --> 00:04:58.250
I was the one that told you I was going to do all the deaths.

78
00:04:58.650 --> 00:04:59.790
And the biggie was like, I don't give a.

79
00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:02.100
He did ready to die with a baby on the cover. Right?

80
00:05:02.160 --> 00:05:05.730
<v 1>Dude, Jared little dome biggie me.</v>

81
00:05:05.880 --> 00:05:09.360
<v 0>I don't, I don't say his name on this podcast, but don't biggie me. Oh,</v>

82
00:05:09.361 --> 00:05:13.890
by the way, if you're watching on the video podcast, just so you know,

83
00:05:13.891 --> 00:05:16.350
I'm serious. I got a thick chain.

84
00:05:18.210 --> 00:05:21.690
<v 1>I have a thick chain on serious.</v>

85
00:05:21.690 --> 00:05:23.970
<v 0>Business. Dude. I have a thick chain on, I had.</v>

86
00:05:23.970 --> 00:05:24.900
<v 1>A thin chain.</v>

87
00:05:26.880 --> 00:05:31.350
<v 0>But I had to level up dude, cause there's guys out there like Jeremy,</v>

88
00:05:31.920 --> 00:05:33.960
[inaudible] floating around and I'm not going to say his name,

89
00:05:35.040 --> 00:05:39.030
but he's floating around in a robe with a bunch of like fives. By the way,

90
00:05:39.480 --> 00:05:42.030
you see the people that are in his cult fives,

91
00:05:42.270 --> 00:05:47.040
maybe a six is in there somewhere. But dude us, we got tens, man.

92
00:05:47.220 --> 00:05:49.380
Everyone's killing it. They're all doing fitness.

93
00:05:49.470 --> 00:05:52.440
The guys are prettier than the girls in our. By the way,

94
00:05:52.770 --> 00:05:56.070
guys walk around all like the Persian guy in 300, just like,

95
00:05:56.250 --> 00:06:00.080
what would you like to today? Those are my dudes.

96
00:06:00.740 --> 00:06:01.940
Those are my dudes.

97
00:06:02.150 --> 00:06:04.970
And we're all in sucking and getting that hedonistic lifestyle.

98
00:06:05.150 --> 00:06:09.740
And we're sitting in the installing the tall grass and I cannot believe I am

99
00:06:09.741 --> 00:06:12.740
right now saying all this stuff with two other guys in this room,

100
00:06:12.830 --> 00:06:16.460
just straight faced doing their own. I haven't get rid of.

101
00:06:16.461 --> 00:06:20.540
And one fire are literally staring at their computers like this emoji,

102
00:06:22.590 --> 00:06:26.520
the emoji with the straight eyes and the straight mouth and I'm being.

103
00:06:26.990 --> 00:06:27.111
Cause they,

104
00:06:27.111 --> 00:06:30.410
you know why because I'm being serious because this isn't a laughing matter.

105
00:06:30.411 --> 00:06:34.520
Dude. I have a, if I take this shirt off and keep the chain on,

106
00:06:34.970 --> 00:06:39.020
I swear to God, I I've done it and walked around and people literally,

107
00:06:39.260 --> 00:06:43.730
and I'm not joking. They mistake me for DMX. They go like, this is that.

108
00:06:43.760 --> 00:06:45.470
Oh nevermind. And I know what they're thinking.

109
00:06:46.850 --> 00:06:49.310
They're thinking is the lawnmower right next to the tray,

110
00:06:52.010 --> 00:06:56.420
The Lamar right next to the tree. My favorite thing about DMX is this.

111
00:06:56.421 --> 00:07:00.920
The melody will be like, dang DNA, DNA,

112
00:07:01.280 --> 00:07:05.960
DNA, DNA, DNA, DNA. That'd be like the melodic tune of the thing.

113
00:07:06.110 --> 00:07:11.090
And the DMX will just straight up, come on and he will go. Dang, dang, dang,

114
00:07:11.330 --> 00:07:15.710
dang, dang, dang, dang, Danny like, Hey dude,

115
00:07:15.980 --> 00:07:20.000
there's some different they're covering that part. I swear to God.

116
00:07:20.090 --> 00:07:20.990
One of the melodies is

117
00:07:25.950 --> 00:07:28.280
[inaudible] and it'll be like, you could be blind and

118
00:07:31.370 --> 00:07:32.540
[inaudible] what's that DMX.

119
00:07:32.541 --> 00:07:35.210
I got to do it from my phone because we're doing it because I don't have sound

120
00:07:35.211 --> 00:07:39.220
on the thing, but we're going to do it, do it, try it. I'll give it to you,

121
00:07:39.250 --> 00:07:42.530
give you the computer. Okay. And while I do it like this,

122
00:07:42.980 --> 00:07:45.560
I'll do it on the thing. But this is what DMX di does you think?

123
00:07:45.561 --> 00:07:50.330
I'm not who we be is the one first who we be DMX.

124
00:07:50.630 --> 00:07:52.820
First thing that comes up, of course, here we go.

125
00:07:57.010 --> 00:07:57.843
<v 1>Busting a nut.</v>

126
00:07:59.680 --> 00:08:02.230
<v 0>Oh wow. Busing. And I never realized in the beginning of the song, he goes,</v>

127
00:08:02.320 --> 00:08:04.270
Oh yeah. Another one of those.

128
00:08:08.200 --> 00:08:12.520
<v 1>What? Doesn't work. It'll still. Yeah. Okay. Well</v>

129
00:08:15.310 --> 00:08:16.450
I can't do it because it's going to.

130
00:08:18.730 --> 00:08:20.830
<v 0>Whatever, dude, I can't do it because it's going to flag it.</v>

131
00:08:21.610 --> 00:08:22.810
It's going to flag the thing.

132
00:08:22.811 --> 00:08:24.610
And then we're not going to be able to monetize it for YouTube.

133
00:08:24.611 --> 00:08:27.340
Like people are like, people are coming to congratulations. Podcasts to listen,

134
00:08:27.341 --> 00:08:31.690
to who we be from DMX on my phone.

135
00:08:31.990 --> 00:08:33.730
That's not even connected to the source.

136
00:08:35.920 --> 00:08:40.210
Like somebody wants to hear me going like, Oh, he's busting a nut over DMX.

137
00:08:40.360 --> 00:08:43.810
Who we be by the way, you know, who's doing that.

138
00:08:43.870 --> 00:08:45.940
Who's listening to who we be.

139
00:08:48.820 --> 00:08:52.540
Anyway. You got it. I worked on fire. Seems to think it's working now.

140
00:08:53.290 --> 00:08:56.550
So we're putting it back on, dude. See, this is it, man.

141
00:08:57.920 --> 00:08:59.820
I'd get you like the rawness dude. Let's see if it works.

142
00:09:01.080 --> 00:09:03.000
It's not working all good,

143
00:09:03.300 --> 00:09:05.790
but you mean it's coming something from the motherboard,

144
00:09:05.820 --> 00:09:07.110
which means it's one fire's fault.

145
00:09:07.350 --> 00:09:10.470
Which means obviously he's not changing his name anytime soon.

146
00:09:11.640 --> 00:09:15.150
So DMX will do that. And uh,

147
00:09:15.210 --> 00:09:18.420
and I'm practically DMX is basically what I'm saying, dude. Cause I got a chain.

148
00:09:18.421 --> 00:09:20.850
I wanted to one day be the shirts off comic.

149
00:09:20.910 --> 00:09:24.210
This is way before Burt Chrysler and now I'm like, okay, well Bert does it.

150
00:09:24.211 --> 00:09:26.910
So I want it to be the jaw rule of comedy is basically what it was,

151
00:09:27.120 --> 00:09:31.650
but now Burt does it and I can't do it. And that's fine. I'm happy for Burt.

152
00:09:31.651 --> 00:09:33.690
Honestly. I think he's got like a million followers on the Instagram,

153
00:09:33.691 --> 00:09:37.620
so that's great. Um, it works now.

154
00:09:38.180 --> 00:09:41.480
<v 1>It works now dude, it works now, man.</v>

155
00:09:41.990 --> 00:09:46.430
It works now. And just so you know, it worked just to prove it works right now.

156
00:09:50.540 --> 00:09:51.373
Yup.

157
00:09:51.530 --> 00:09:54.350
<v 0>Hell yeah, dude. Let's get these in. Uh,</v>
