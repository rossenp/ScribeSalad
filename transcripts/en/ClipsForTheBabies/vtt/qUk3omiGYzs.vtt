1
00:00:01.230 --> 00:00:04.080
<v 0>Okay. Let's do some questions, bro. We haven't done this in a while.</v>

2
00:00:04.290 --> 00:00:07.680
Let's do some questions. Um,

3
00:00:11.150 --> 00:00:15.740
Oh, interesting. On episode 36, this is by Wade nine eight one zero.

4
00:00:16.670 --> 00:00:17.690
On episode 36,

5
00:00:17.691 --> 00:00:20.600
you answered a Twitter question about wearing sunglasses indoors and said it was

6
00:00:20.601 --> 00:00:21.410
terrible.

7
00:00:21.410 --> 00:00:25.670
Did you change your mind or did your future just get so bright that it became a

8
00:00:25.671 --> 00:00:27.020
health hazard and you had to,

9
00:00:27.380 --> 00:00:31.700
so I understand futures to bright futures, so bright.

10
00:00:32.570 --> 00:00:35.300
See, I wear sunglasses indoors cause my future. But here's the deal, man.

11
00:00:35.301 --> 00:00:39.350
You can kind of do anything as long as your attitude is like, you.

12
00:00:39.590 --> 00:00:42.710
You know what I'm saying? Like I was thinking about this the other day.

13
00:00:44.750 --> 00:00:45.583
Uh,

14
00:00:46.130 --> 00:00:50.930
if you wear Tivas or Birkenstocks

15
00:00:50.960 --> 00:00:53.450
or doc Martens,

16
00:00:54.290 --> 00:00:59.000
like my point is if you wear some real corny.

17
00:01:01.070 --> 00:01:04.370
Okay. And if you're wearing it,

18
00:01:04.400 --> 00:01:07.940
because you're not thinking about what you're wearing and you're just like, Oh,

19
00:01:07.970 --> 00:01:10.940
someone gave me those are all wear them or, okay, cool.

20
00:01:11.120 --> 00:01:15.560
I'll put them on because they're convenient or they're comfortable then your a

21
00:01:17.480 --> 00:01:22.250
dork. But if you legit think, Whoa Tivas are they?

22
00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:26.540
And you're like, I know they're not in fashion,

23
00:01:26.541 --> 00:01:30.320
but y'all because I think they're the. Then more power to you.

24
00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:34.610
Most guys who wear sunglasses at night or indoors,

25
00:01:34.790 --> 00:01:38.960
they're wearing them because they're insecure and they want to show you how cool

26
00:01:38.961 --> 00:01:42.440
they are. But if you actually are like, y'all,

27
00:01:43.250 --> 00:01:45.500
I'm going to wear these indoors because I'm a.

28
00:01:47.690 --> 00:01:50.930
Then dude, that's some serious Jeremy Renner.

29
00:01:54.140 --> 00:01:56.150
If you're wearing a long coat in the desert,

30
00:01:58.670 --> 00:02:02.480
just because someone made you think it's a good idea,

31
00:02:03.410 --> 00:02:04.280
then straight up.

32
00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:11.150
But if you're wearing it because you think long coats are the and

33
00:02:11.151 --> 00:02:14.600
short coats can go suck then honestly.

34
00:02:17.630 --> 00:02:18.463
<v 1>[Inaudible].</v>

35
00:02:20.720 --> 00:02:22.070
<v 0>So there's no mind change in babies.</v>

36
00:02:22.071 --> 00:02:24.620
Now that doesn't mean that it doesn't change his mind.

37
00:02:24.621 --> 00:02:27.800
No daddy changes his mind because changing your mind is all about growth in the

38
00:02:27.801 --> 00:02:31.550
world changes. So you have to, when people are like, change,

39
00:02:32.870 --> 00:02:36.440
that's crazy to me for life to continue to rip.

40
00:02:36.530 --> 00:02:40.730
You have to keep changing. We grow every cell in your body.

41
00:02:40.760 --> 00:02:43.820
Wasn't in your body about 10 years ago. They're all new cells.

42
00:02:45.050 --> 00:02:47.540
And I think that that's true, probably because Neil Brendan told me.

43
00:02:48.710 --> 00:02:53.300
So anyway. Yeah. That's some real.

44
00:02:54.200 --> 00:02:56.780
Is there another question? Thanks for your question. Weighed nine,

45
00:02:56.781 --> 00:02:57.614
eight one zero.

46
00:02:59.890 --> 00:03:04.570
Austin Burns at Austin dolphins, crystal, Leah, thoughts on fantasy football.

47
00:03:05.500 --> 00:03:10.210
I mean, so wants me to be favorable about it. Cause his name is dolphins in it.

48
00:03:11.650 --> 00:03:15.460
Um, bro, my brother does fantasy baseball and.

49
00:03:16.420 --> 00:03:18.760
And look, let we know.

50
00:03:18.761 --> 00:03:23.110
Obviously there is absolutely nothing dark here than fantasy football.

51
00:03:23.170 --> 00:03:27.400
Everybody knows. It's all good. And it's fine. And it's fine. It's all good.

52
00:03:28.330 --> 00:03:31.510
Now is fantasy football dorky? Yes. Is it all good? Yeah,

53
00:03:32.080 --> 00:03:36.460
don't do fantasy football and think it's not dorky. You know what? I'm a dork.

54
00:03:36.850 --> 00:03:39.970
If you're doing fantasy football, you're basically the guy saying, well,

55
00:03:39.971 --> 00:03:41.980
I just think it's interesting because the original,

56
00:03:42.250 --> 00:03:43.960
the original comics that Wolverine had it,

57
00:03:43.990 --> 00:03:46.720
he had a different outfit on and whatever, if they're going to update it fine,

58
00:03:46.721 --> 00:03:48.820
but still stick true to the thing. But they're not really doing that.

59
00:03:48.821 --> 00:03:52.450
And that's fine basically. That's what you're doing. If you're like, Oh, dude,

60
00:03:52.660 --> 00:03:55.120
Tim, salmon's got some. So now I'm,

61
00:03:55.450 --> 00:03:59.350
my is my teams on top.

62
00:03:59.500 --> 00:04:03.250
Cause Tim salmon you're you're basically saying, look,

63
00:04:03.251 --> 00:04:05.170
I just think it's funny that the jug or not, you know,

64
00:04:05.180 --> 00:04:08.080
could go through walls and it's like, obviously he could be stopped,

65
00:04:08.081 --> 00:04:10.030
but Nightcrawler, all he needs to do is take care of business.

66
00:04:10.031 --> 00:04:14.470
And he's not doing that. This basically what you're doing is you're saying,

67
00:04:14.860 --> 00:04:18.400
dude, I, I just think it's funny that, you know, Todd zeal,

68
00:04:19.450 --> 00:04:22.780
Todd Ziel, obviously, he could do a little bit better, but he's not because,

69
00:04:25.180 --> 00:04:26.860
because of the injury and it sucks because he's on my

70
00:04:28.600 --> 00:04:33.280
he's on my fantasy team. No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no. Oh yeah.

71
00:04:33.310 --> 00:04:35.440
Todd seals on my fantasy team. No, he's not dude.

72
00:04:36.040 --> 00:04:39.580
Todd's deals on the Cardinals and that's it now do I knew new players? No.

73
00:04:41.350 --> 00:04:42.430
Isn't Molina a player.

74
00:04:43.480 --> 00:04:48.310
The shortstop guy Moline is killing it. Cause he's, he's a shortstop. I'm a fan.

75
00:04:48.311 --> 00:04:51.190
He's on my fantasy team. No, he's not. He's only on St. Louis.

76
00:04:52.360 --> 00:04:55.960
He's only on the card knows Molina's not on your team. You know why?

77
00:04:56.320 --> 00:04:59.710
Because Molina is not on your team. Number one and Molina is on St.

78
00:04:59.711 --> 00:05:02.710
Louis number two and number three, you don't have a team,

79
00:05:06.750 --> 00:05:11.040
A dark, it's a fantasy football, take a hike.

80
00:05:11.280 --> 00:05:16.140
My brother will go like bro mom, my fantasy team is killing it. And I go,

81
00:05:16.360 --> 00:05:19.170
Oh, I really, it doesn't matter. And he laughs because he knows dark.

82
00:05:22.590 --> 00:05:23.420
You know?

83
00:05:23.420 --> 00:05:27.600
W how about the dorkiest about the FA the fantasy football are the names that

84
00:05:27.601 --> 00:05:29.460
people use for their teams.

85
00:05:32.160 --> 00:05:35.820
It's like, that's the only thing. Worse than band names. Like sparkle, horse,

86
00:05:35.850 --> 00:05:36.683
you know?

87
00:05:41.010 --> 00:05:41.843
Uh, yeah.

88
00:05:45.210 --> 00:05:48.840
W what is this people say, do you have people come at me? They say, Oh,

89
00:05:48.841 --> 00:05:51.750
you don't have this. Hey, Chris, Leah, you're holding it.

90
00:05:51.780 --> 00:05:54.480
The first four 41 episodes of congrats pod hostage.

91
00:05:54.481 --> 00:05:56.550

00:05:56.730 --> 00:06:01.580

anyway, dude. Um, what else?

95
00:06:12.231 --> 00:06:13.100
Any other questions?

96
00:06:16.190 --> 00:06:18.170
One fire says this one's funny. So if it's not

You should get that for your, your girlfriend. That's what my mom would do.

00:11:13.940 --> 00:11:18.770
It's all good. Let me look at my texts and see who's got what? Let me see.

163
00:11:18.771 --> 00:11:21.710
Who's texting me. I, I thing here,

164
00:11:25.670 --> 00:11:29.360
guy writes, Hey, can I send you a shirt and a beanie?

165
00:11:30.920 --> 00:11:32.750
Uh, man, I don't know. I'm writing.

166
00:11:33.080 --> 00:11:36.440
I don't really like beanies that much,

167
00:11:37.400 --> 00:11:38.270
that much.

168
00:11:39.020 --> 00:11:43.910
And every time I'm texting this guy back time,

169
00:11:44.330 --> 00:11:47.780
someone sends me a shirt.

170
00:11:48.470 --> 00:11:53.380
It seems like it would fit only

171
00:11:53.590 --> 00:11:57.460
a child. I've got to keep it real, man. There you go.

172
00:11:57.490 --> 00:12:01.570
Aiden just texted you back, dude. I gotta keep it real. I can't,

173
00:12:01.780 --> 00:12:02.613
I can't front.

174
00:12:05.170 --> 00:12:09.880
There's this weird thing that's going on in comedy. Um,

175
00:12:11.110 --> 00:12:13.450
and uh, it's like,

176
00:12:15.310 --> 00:12:20.230
it's this thing where like people want to like the cause the left

177
00:12:20.231 --> 00:12:24.160
is being so pussified that these comedians want to

178
00:12:25.000 --> 00:12:27.190
quote unquote, tell it like it is.

179
00:12:28.150 --> 00:12:30.940
And that's becoming really increasingly annoying,

180
00:12:31.360 --> 00:12:34.660
like any reaction to something that's so drastic is also annoying.

181
00:12:34.930 --> 00:12:37.600
So like there's this thing where it's like,

182
00:12:38.450 --> 00:12:41.970
some comedians are really good at it. Like bill Burr, Chris rock,

183
00:12:42.240 --> 00:12:47.130
Dave Chappelle. They do the telling it like it is at the,

184
00:12:47.131 --> 00:12:51.600
it meets the funniness, but some comedians are like, bro,

185
00:12:51.601 --> 00:12:53.670
I just got to keep it real and tell it like it is.

186
00:12:53.970 --> 00:12:57.090
And they do it so hard that they're not being funny as well.

187
00:12:57.120 --> 00:12:59.760
Like that should never be the forefront I've been thinking about this man.

188
00:12:59.770 --> 00:13:04.440
So many comedians are trying to tell it like it is that it isn't being

189
00:13:04.441 --> 00:13:05.274
funny.

190
00:13:05.340 --> 00:13:09.540
And then there's enough people in the world that will like you,

191
00:13:09.541 --> 00:13:10.351
no matter what,

192
00:13:10.351 --> 00:13:13.980
if you have some sort of fan base because there's 7 billion people out there

193
00:13:14.160 --> 00:13:18.060
that some people will just be like, Hey man, props to you for keeping it real.

194
00:13:18.270 --> 00:13:22.890
No, not props to that person for keeping it real stop keeping it real may funny.

195
00:13:26.310 --> 00:13:31.140
I don't want to keep it real even though, you know, that has got to keep it real

196
00:13:32.730 --> 00:13:37.290
because this he's the two Parker comedy, but really be funny.

197
00:13:37.470 --> 00:13:40.110
That's why I always say we're done for a silly goose time and that's it, man.

198
00:13:40.890 --> 00:13:42.420
I don't want you to mistake me for one of those.

199
00:13:43.050 --> 00:13:46.350
That's always telling it like it is bro.

200
00:13:47.190 --> 00:13:50.280
Keep in mind, always underlying,

201
00:13:53.640 --> 00:13:56.940
but also onstage silly goose time.

202
00:13:59.190 --> 00:14:03.360
You got to mix the with the,

203
00:14:04.590 --> 00:14:08.850
because if you just have the, then you won't have enough,

204
00:14:10.320 --> 00:14:12.510
but what we're really looking for is,

205
00:14:16.320 --> 00:14:17.153
you know what I'm saying?

206
00:14:17.880 --> 00:14:21.930
Does that make sense for a hearing aid for a hearing aid for an audio aid?

207
00:14:21.931 --> 00:14:22.920
Does that make sense to you?

208
00:14:27.480 --> 00:14:29.220
It's not enough to just keep it real. Be funny.
