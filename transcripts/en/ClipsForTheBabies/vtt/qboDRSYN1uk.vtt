WEBVTT

1
00:00:00.420 --> 00:00:05.100
<v 0>But, um, what have I done? I was in, we've been shooting. I shot guns for the,</v>

2
00:00:05.101 --> 00:00:09.090
for the first time. Uh, I shot a pistol and an M four.

3
00:00:09.120 --> 00:00:12.000
I think that was what it was. That was what the Navy seals guys were telling me.

4
00:00:13.830 --> 00:00:16.200
Um, the first day I was just like,

5
00:00:16.201 --> 00:00:19.860
so it's weird to pick up like a killing machine, you know,

6
00:00:19.950 --> 00:00:22.770
like something that's made for killing that's what was in my head.

7
00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:26.490
And then the second day I was like, I felt like Ron wick,

8
00:00:27.090 --> 00:00:31.260
I felt like I was like, John Wick's brother. I was like, I got this. Um,

9
00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:36.450
but the, the empty rounds will fly out and hit your face. And that hot,

10
00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:41.010
like summer on your face, dude. Um,

11
00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:44.640
and that's like, you know, I was just thinking about like, okay,

12
00:00:44.641 --> 00:00:47.100
like you hit targets. First of all, we don't have to hit targets.

13
00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:48.690
Cause we're in a movie, you know what I'm talking about?

14
00:00:48.691 --> 00:00:52.860
So you're doing that and you got the gun and then you, and then you got it.

15
00:00:52.861 --> 00:00:55.680
And then it doesn't really matter. In the first time I was doing,

16
00:00:55.681 --> 00:00:57.620
I was like trying to hit the target. And I was like, well,

17
00:00:57.621 --> 00:01:01.020
I don't need to hit the target. It'll cut. And I'll hit the target.

18
00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:03.750
It'll edit it into me, hitting the target. So I was like,

19
00:01:03.751 --> 00:01:08.190
I gotta concentrate just on like drawing and like that. And, uh,

20
00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:13.020
so I was drawing, so I would, I would do that and I would fire it and uh,

21
00:01:13.980 --> 00:01:17.910
I dunno where I was going with this. But, uh, so I was really was, uh,

22
00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:21.360
trying to do my, I don't know. Do you know what actually has been happening?

23
00:01:21.480 --> 00:01:25.470
I've been looking at my phone too long and now it makes my brain dead.

24
00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:29.430
It makes my brain like dude, before phones, I would think of stuff in the world.

25
00:01:29.431 --> 00:01:31.260
Like, I'd be like, Oh, this is like, that. That's like this,

26
00:01:31.261 --> 00:01:32.071
it would make me funny right now.

27
00:01:32.071 --> 00:01:36.920
I just stare at Instagram or Twitter or whatever. And I just feel like, uh, uh,

28
00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:42.300
uh, a piece of. Yeah. But I don't know.

29
00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:45.060
But like, yeah, I used to think of, phones me up.

30
00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:46.800
I used to think of and now I don't think of.

31
00:01:47.400 --> 00:01:52.270
Like I was just at Starbucks and I noticed something that was funny at Starbucks

32
00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:54.660
at Starbucks. Like when I was at Starbucks, this dude,

33
00:01:54.810 --> 00:01:57.330
these two dudes walk in and there were S Albuquerque,

34
00:01:57.331 --> 00:02:00.780
like one guy came in and had like tattoos all over. And he's real skinny.

35
00:02:01.140 --> 00:02:03.420
If you're skinny and you got tattoos all over you're from Albuquerque.

36
00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:04.320
And so he was like,

37
00:02:04.680 --> 00:02:08.040
he was chilling with his other buddy and his other brother buddy looked, um,

38
00:02:08.370 --> 00:02:12.180
like him, if he was on a,

39
00:02:13.320 --> 00:02:16.860
if he was on a, like a, a workout plan, like he's a little healthier.

40
00:02:18.250 --> 00:02:20.610
And they were sitting down and I wasn't looking behind me,

41
00:02:20.611 --> 00:02:21.520
but they were talking.

42
00:02:21.720 --> 00:02:25.800
And all I kept hearing was this dude who was like a,

43
00:02:26.220 --> 00:02:30.990
a dog, a dog. Um, if it was real, the other guy's name was Chris. It's like,

44
00:02:31.110 --> 00:02:34.770
Hey, Chris, he's like, take a, take a picture, take a picture of me, dog.

45
00:02:35.580 --> 00:02:38.520
And then Chris took a into her and Chris like, laid that.

46
00:02:39.120 --> 00:02:41.670
And then the guy was like, nah, man, come on, man.

47
00:02:41.671 --> 00:02:45.540
I don't like a picture like that. And he was like, take a,

48
00:02:45.570 --> 00:02:48.000
take a different picture of me dog. And Chris was like, nah, bro,

49
00:02:48.001 --> 00:02:50.310
you gotta do it like this. He was like, nah, dog.

50
00:02:50.550 --> 00:02:53.700
And he took another picture and he say, amen, come on, man.

51
00:02:53.701 --> 00:02:55.620
Don't take a picture like that. I hate pictures like that.

52
00:02:55.680 --> 00:02:57.930
That's what he was saying. And I was like, what the? Kind of pictures?

53
00:02:58.140 --> 00:03:03.070
Like how they were in a Starbucks? Like what kind of picture is he taking?

54
00:03:03.280 --> 00:03:05.410
I want it to turn around so bad, but I didn't want them to be like, Hey,

55
00:03:05.411 --> 00:03:08.980
what the are you looking at, bro? You're not from here. So,

56
00:03:10.510 --> 00:03:14.620
and I was like, thinking about how that was funny, you know? And I was like, ah,

57
00:03:14.650 --> 00:03:16.360
dude, I can maybe make a bit about that.

58
00:03:16.630 --> 00:03:20.890
And then I just started looking at my phone, forgot no bit.

59
00:03:20.920 --> 00:03:23.650
There will be no bit about that. Not even on my pockets.

60
00:03:23.651 --> 00:03:24.520
I'm talking about onstage.

61
00:03:24.550 --> 00:03:28.030
If that's not going to be new material now because of Instagram,

62
00:03:30.370 --> 00:03:33.040
uh, I was in the same Starbucks and this guy comes up to me. He's like, Hey man,

63
00:03:33.070 --> 00:03:36.190
I really like your hair. And I was like, God, thanks. And he says, yeah,

64
00:03:36.400 --> 00:03:39.460
I always want a curly hair like that. And I said, Oh yeah. And he said, yeah,

65
00:03:39.680 --> 00:03:42.880
I had long Johnny Depp here. That was like silver and.

66
00:03:43.900 --> 00:03:46.750
And then just walked out. Didn't even get a coffee. It's like,

67
00:03:46.751 --> 00:03:50.950
he came to just look for somebody with cool hair and then walked out,

68
00:03:51.070 --> 00:03:53.320
walked into Starbucks, was homeless. Maybe not.

69
00:03:53.530 --> 00:03:56.410
Maybe people are homeless or maybe they're from Albuquerque. I don't know.

70
00:03:57.220 --> 00:04:00.910
You know? And um,

71
00:04:02.050 --> 00:04:06.130
went to some local restaurants and. And no matter what I do too,

72
00:04:06.131 --> 00:04:09.040
it's like the wrong thing. Like I'll post something. I'll making fun of.

73
00:04:09.340 --> 00:04:13.090
I'm making fun of on my Instagram. And then somebody will write me all, bro.

74
00:04:13.091 --> 00:04:15.820
You're not even going to the right place, man. You make fun of Albuquerque,

75
00:04:15.821 --> 00:04:18.340
but there's a lot of cool places. And then go to another place and then say, Oh,

76
00:04:18.341 --> 00:04:20.680
you got to go to this other place. Then I go to that place. Nah, bro,

77
00:04:20.681 --> 00:04:23.410
you got to go shut the up. I'll just do whatever. You know, it'll be fine.

78
00:04:23.620 --> 00:04:24.430
A place is cool.

79
00:04:24.430 --> 00:04:27.310
It's not cool if you're there for two weeks and you're bored of,

80
00:04:27.700 --> 00:04:32.110
then that's how it is. Hopefully this doesn't make the news. Um,

81
00:04:32.350 --> 00:04:35.530
but it's fine, dude. It's not, it's not, it's not bad. It's not a bad place.

82
00:04:35.890 --> 00:04:40.550
It's actually, the people are really nice. Um, and uh,

83
00:04:41.050 --> 00:04:41.261
you know,

84
00:04:41.261 --> 00:04:44.680
what's really cool about Albuquerque is they don't bother you too much.

85
00:04:44.950 --> 00:04:48.520
Like people aren't in your face like everywhere else. I go, they're more,

86
00:04:48.730 --> 00:04:52.210
they're more like, like, dude, I'm not, I'll tell you what in Albuquerque.

87
00:04:52.240 --> 00:04:56.290
I'm the least famous guy. Nobody, nobody can. I get a picture of so only a very,

88
00:04:56.291 --> 00:04:58.630
very rarely everywhere else I go. Can I get a bit of a bigger picture?

89
00:04:58.840 --> 00:05:01.450
Maybe it's the news thing. Maybe they're tried to boycott me. I don't know.

90
00:05:01.960 --> 00:05:02.793
But um.

91
00:05:05.460 --> 00:05:06.293
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

92
00:05:08.970 --> 00:05:11.550
<v 0>I dunno. Albuquerque is a lot of mud huts and it's weird.</v>

93
00:05:11.580 --> 00:05:16.050
It's got this whole like new Mexico's got like it it's so weird how it goes

94
00:05:16.051 --> 00:05:19.470
over. Like from the, from the West coast, California,

95
00:05:19.770 --> 00:05:22.710
the style of California is just kinda whatever.

96
00:05:22.711 --> 00:05:24.480
It just doesn't really have crazy style.

97
00:05:24.690 --> 00:05:29.670
Then you get over to like Arizona and it's got this obvious kind of like sort of

98
00:05:29.671 --> 00:05:31.650
like, I guess like, uh,

99
00:05:32.220 --> 00:05:35.850
like I don't even know how to describe it like this as techie and Indian type

100
00:05:36.210 --> 00:05:38.790
style. And then you get over to New Mexico and it's like,

101
00:05:38.791 --> 00:05:40.050
you're just there pretty much.

102
00:05:40.051 --> 00:05:44.970
It's like got this like Mexican sort of like really like there's no

103
00:05:44.971 --> 00:05:49.200
mistaking this artwork and now it's pretty,

104
00:05:49.350 --> 00:05:51.900
it's always just like tan and Brown and.

105
00:05:52.680 --> 00:05:56.670
And that you see that sun with the, with the, like the thing on the lightweight,

106
00:05:56.671 --> 00:05:58.970
that is everywhere. Like the Albuquerque symbol.

107
00:05:59.090 --> 00:06:02.240
I've never seen a symbol more in a place than Albuquerque.

108
00:06:02.241 --> 00:06:03.350
People have it on the back of their neck.

109
00:06:03.410 --> 00:06:06.230
They get a tattooed due to Albuquerque. Here's the other thing too. And I'm,

110
00:06:06.231 --> 00:06:10.490
and I'm not even knocking it, but you guys, Oh my, my buddy on the, on the,

111
00:06:10.491 --> 00:06:13.970
on the show that we're doing Omari Hardwick, he's on power. He's on this movie.

112
00:06:14.360 --> 00:06:16.940
He got a dope tattoo. I might go to the tattoo place.

113
00:06:16.941 --> 00:06:20.090
But most of the tattoos in the Albuquerque you look like you were just bored and

114
00:06:20.091 --> 00:06:22.250
went to go get the tattoo. And we're like, yeah. Okay. I guess.

115
00:06:23.270 --> 00:06:27.620
And so many's Albuquerque sons with the, um, what do you call it on the, uh,

116
00:06:28.310 --> 00:06:32.150
on Lego it's same thing on the license plate, but anyway, um, and then after,

117
00:06:33.230 --> 00:06:37.280
uh, Santa Santa Fe, after New Mexico, what's after New Mexico,

118
00:06:38.030 --> 00:06:41.450
Texas what's to the East, that's it.

119
00:06:42.770 --> 00:06:45.890
And then it's like kind of gone. It's sort of gone. I mean,

120
00:06:45.891 --> 00:06:50.180
Texas is kind of more cowboy. And then it's gone after Texas is just like,

121
00:06:51.260 --> 00:06:54.140
there's no, like, I, I guess it's influenced from Mexico, I guess.

122
00:06:54.170 --> 00:06:57.470
I don't know I could Google it, but I'm not going to, you know,

123
00:06:57.740 --> 00:07:01.790
so just that's how it is. We learned, so yeah,

124
00:07:01.820 --> 00:07:03.650
I went to the Starbucks. I don't know,

125
00:07:04.160 --> 00:07:06.290
Starbucks stills tastes like a back of a cow's mouth.

126
00:07:06.470 --> 00:07:08.060
I've had some other cool coffee shops that are cool,

127
00:07:08.061 --> 00:07:11.450
but also they're not that good. People are like, you got to go this one,

128
00:07:11.451 --> 00:07:14.780
I go to that one. It's not that good. Also what's up with like,

129
00:07:15.980 --> 00:07:17.180
if it's not painted Brown,

130
00:07:17.181 --> 00:07:21.020
it's painted white and it's so sunny that I needed to get glasses.

131
00:07:23.180 --> 00:07:26.690
I got these sunglasses from sunglass hut. I drove to the mall to do it.

132
00:07:27.680 --> 00:07:30.620
And I was like, I got it. I give up. I was like, I literally, like I was,

133
00:07:30.650 --> 00:07:34.160
I was like, I give up, dude, I it's too bright.

134
00:07:34.490 --> 00:07:37.220
I got to Albuquerque. I was like, it doesn't really matter.

135
00:07:37.221 --> 00:07:41.240
I don't need to get sunglasses. I can just walk around. My opener,

136
00:07:41.241 --> 00:07:43.730
never has sunglasses. He's always just kind of squint. And I was like,

137
00:07:43.731 --> 00:07:48.020
I could do it, bro is brighter here. Did you know that it's brighter here.

138
00:07:48.620 --> 00:07:51.710
So I had to go to the mall. Okay. By the way I go to this mall,

139
00:07:51.711 --> 00:07:55.010
every other store is a shoe store. Now here's the deal. Every other sources,

140
00:07:55.050 --> 00:07:59.870
stores this shoe store. But also I walk in, as soon as I go, there's a walk in,

141
00:07:59.900 --> 00:08:04.190
there's a kiosk of sunglass hut. So I was like, okay, cool. So I say, Hey man,

142
00:08:04.340 --> 00:08:07.250
do you have any like Ray Ray-Bans those are the kinds of like, I was like,

143
00:08:07.251 --> 00:08:10.700
I'm just going to get it. And he was like, ah, we don't have the kind you want.

144
00:08:11.180 --> 00:08:12.440
He said, I said, Oh,

145
00:08:12.441 --> 00:08:15.800
but aren't there other isn't there like another sunglass hut here in the mall.

146
00:08:15.830 --> 00:08:19.540
And he goes like, this there's four. Hi, Hey,

147
00:08:20.110 --> 00:08:25.060
there's four sunglass huts in the mall in Albuquerque

148
00:08:25.061 --> 00:08:28.780
in the Coronado mall. You don't need for

149
00:08:31.390 --> 00:08:32.380
it. Need a wad,

150
00:08:34.360 --> 00:08:38.020
just take the kiosks and put them all in the one one.

151
00:08:39.040 --> 00:08:42.460
You can seriously do that. Academy of glasses,

152
00:08:44.980 --> 00:08:49.870
Academy of lenses put the sunglasses

153
00:08:50.950 --> 00:08:54.460
in the kiosk. Why am I peaking? I'm peaking.

154
00:08:56.040 --> 00:09:00.840
Oh, I'm picking, put the sunglass. Eh,

155
00:09:00.870 --> 00:09:02.850
yeah. Okay. That's better hot.

156
00:09:03.300 --> 00:09:07.080
I guess it sounds like maybe I'm it's going to be a rough one. Um,

157
00:09:08.850 --> 00:09:11.220
so that's what it is here. You're going here.

158
00:09:13.590 --> 00:09:18.540
You got a good news for me. Why? Oh, okay.

159
00:09:19.530 --> 00:09:22.530
All right. Anyway, uh, I, I, we did, we went to sunglass hut.

160
00:09:22.740 --> 00:09:27.000
I went to sunglass hut by myself and I got the glasses and it's all good.

161
00:09:27.001 --> 00:09:30.990
This is so boring. What am I doing here? I don't, I don't, you know what though?

162
00:09:35.000 --> 00:09:36.020
I just feel like you're, you know,

163
00:09:36.021 --> 00:09:38.240
some podcasts are going to be good and some are going to be boring.

164
00:09:38.241 --> 00:09:42.260
I listened to, I listened to some other, uh, some other podcasts and by the way,

165
00:09:42.261 --> 00:09:44.660
I listened to some other podcasts and they're boring as too,

166
00:09:44.870 --> 00:09:47.210
except for some of them are, really interesting.

167
00:09:47.211 --> 00:09:48.500
This one will never be really interesting.

168
00:09:48.501 --> 00:09:49.850
It'll just be kind of funny sometimes.
