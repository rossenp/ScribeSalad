00:00:00.210 --> 00:00:04.830
<v 0>The Epstein documentary dude, first of all,</v>

2
00:00:04.831 --> 00:00:07.010
I said this about pizza a long time ago,

3
00:00:07.011 --> 00:00:08.960
about how I didn't think that it was a thing.

4
00:00:09.050 --> 00:00:10.730
And I didn't think about how there were,

5
00:00:10.760 --> 00:00:13.130
there were no pedophile rings in Hollywood and then people were,

6
00:00:13.400 --> 00:00:14.750
what about Jeffrey Epstein?

7
00:00:14.751 --> 00:00:18.830
Man is pretty quick case closed about the jeopardy of Britain. And I'm like,

8
00:00:18.831 --> 00:00:22.310
yeah, dude, Jeffrey Epstein. Wasn't in Hollywood, man.

9
00:00:22.610 --> 00:00:25.460
Jeffrey Epstein was a billionaire because he liked

10
00:00:27.350 --> 00:00:31.790
move people's monies around and bought businesses and. And of course,

11
00:00:31.910 --> 00:00:36.890
some people in Hollywood are bad just because some people are bad. You know,

12
00:00:37.760 --> 00:00:39.990
how was like, I did the thing about pizza cake. People are like,

13
00:00:39.991 --> 00:00:44.540
well that's because obviously Chris has something to hide. He's a PIDO. Well,

14
00:00:44.541 --> 00:00:46.370
he's obviously got something. Cause I'm looking at him. Look at him,

15
00:00:46.460 --> 00:00:48.050
look at him, look left, look at them, look left.

16
00:00:48.140 --> 00:00:48.771
When he said it that's something.

17
00:00:48.771 --> 00:00:53.600
He does somebody that does when they're a lawyer. And um,

18
00:00:54.380 --> 00:00:59.060
but I saw the Jeffrey Epstein thing. And man, that dude looks a little bit,

19
00:01:00.440 --> 00:01:02.570
I mean, that dude is a sociopath,

20
00:01:03.530 --> 00:01:05.630
but the documentary on Netflix,

21
00:01:05.690 --> 00:01:09.260
it was called like the Epstein files or whatever the it's called Epstein pure

22
00:01:09.261 --> 00:01:11.150
money or some. It was called help.

23
00:01:11.180 --> 00:01:15.530
Epstein healthy on the go is what it was Epstein facial scrubs grow.

24
00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:19.850
And on the go green, good for the earth go li directed by Leah,

25
00:01:20.270 --> 00:01:23.330
Michelle directed by Lee, Michelle Gellar. And um,

26
00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:27.050
and uh, and dude,

27
00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:31.580
and he molested so many women and girls and it's so

28
00:01:32.180 --> 00:01:33.170
up. And dude,

29
00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:38.120
the guy just didn't at the end of the documentary.

30
00:01:38.121 --> 00:01:40.850
And this is all you can't ruin a documentary. I'm not ruining the documentary,

31
00:01:40.851 --> 00:01:43.580
the da at the end of the thing, he was like, he moved his money around.

32
00:01:43.581 --> 00:01:48.140
So the victims couldn't be paid. Like this guy was such a piece of.

33
00:01:49.220 --> 00:01:51.740
And then he killed himself. The other thing too, that I disagree with.

34
00:01:51.741 --> 00:01:53.270
A lot of people I want people are like, well, he killed himself.

35
00:01:53.271 --> 00:01:54.950
He didn't get to live out his sentence. And that sucks.

36
00:01:54.951 --> 00:01:56.450
He escaped the pain dude, that.

37
00:01:56.600 --> 00:01:59.590
You know how probably painful killing yourself is probably hurts a lot too.

38
00:02:00.140 --> 00:02:03.890
But also he didn't kill himself. Dude,

39
00:02:04.040 --> 00:02:06.920
the cameras didn't work and the cops were sleeping.

40
00:02:07.100 --> 00:02:11.780
The guards and Epstein hung himself. By the way, he didn't even,

41
00:02:12.170 --> 00:02:14.120
I don't even think he jumped off something. I forget.

42
00:02:14.150 --> 00:02:18.620
I think he just like tried to sit down really quickly and hang himself and broke

43
00:02:18.621 --> 00:02:22.430
his neck, doing it and the coroner or whatever the they call them.

44
00:02:22.580 --> 00:02:27.410
The forensics medical guy was like, um, no, this has never happened.

45
00:02:27.411 --> 00:02:28.550
This is extremely rare.

46
00:02:28.700 --> 00:02:33.080
And that means it didn't happen to Epstein got choked, dude.

47
00:02:33.980 --> 00:02:38.660
So guy walks into the thing, paid a guard.

48
00:02:38.810 --> 00:02:41.930
What a million, 3 million, $4 million.

49
00:02:42.590 --> 00:02:47.420
These are billionaires that were jerking off on a massage

50
00:02:47.421 --> 00:02:52.370
table with high school girls. You, you wouldn't cover it up for $10 million.

51
00:02:52.371 --> 00:02:55.460
If you've got $95 billion, of course you would.

52
00:02:55.520 --> 00:02:59.200
So they pay the bagel a guard, just so you know, I'm going to the,

53
00:03:00.010 --> 00:03:00.940
I'm going to change your life.

54
00:03:01.150 --> 00:03:03.460
You're going to be driving around and whatever the foreign you want,

55
00:03:03.970 --> 00:03:05.620
your houses are going to have a many doors.

56
00:03:06.040 --> 00:03:10.690
You're going to have a pool and you might even have to just let me get into that

57
00:03:11.350 --> 00:03:16.060
and choke and police. And they go like this. Okay. Don't tell anybody.

58
00:03:16.150 --> 00:03:19.540
And the guy says, why would I tell anybody? If I tell anybody,

59
00:03:19.570 --> 00:03:22.390
then I got to go to jail too. And then they both jumped.

60
00:03:22.540 --> 00:03:24.640
Like the Toyota commercials that they go, I left,

61
00:03:24.730 --> 00:03:27.430
they jumped and they stopped paying and they were freeze frame with their legs

62
00:03:27.431 --> 00:03:30.040
up. I love what you do for me.

63
00:03:31.870 --> 00:03:35.560
That's what happened. And then, he goes, I'll be right back. And then it goes,

64
00:03:35.740 --> 00:03:37.510
kink on opens the thing and goes

65
00:03:39.070 --> 00:03:41.950
tiptoes near Jeffrey Epstein and goes like this. Remember me?

66
00:03:41.951 --> 00:03:44.560
And then chokes him so hard that he broke his neck, man.

67
00:03:45.040 --> 00:03:49.540
It's obviously what happened. And I'm no conspiracy theorist, dude.

68
00:03:50.020 --> 00:03:54.910
I don't believe in any conspiracies. Oh,

69
00:03:54.920 --> 00:03:56.890
chasms, razor or whatever the they say.

70
00:03:58.060 --> 00:04:00.670
It's probably what the you think it is. But this,

71
00:04:02.110 --> 00:04:05.260
this Jeffrey Epstein, somebody murdered this guy.

72
00:04:07.840 --> 00:04:09.370
And dude, I'm a detective man.

73
00:04:09.640 --> 00:04:13.840
I walk into the Epstein thing and I go like this. Well he,

74
00:04:14.980 --> 00:04:18.910
he sat down into a news. Hmm. Something seems fishy.

75
00:04:19.480 --> 00:04:24.070
Wow. Hmm. And you guys already think,

76
00:04:24.071 --> 00:04:27.460
you know what happens? You think he killed himself? Hmm.

77
00:04:27.490 --> 00:04:31.900
Jeffrey Epstein killed himself. I don't know. A little too.

78
00:04:35.430 --> 00:04:36.480
<v 1>Premature.</v>

79
00:04:37.800 --> 00:04:42.030
<v 0>A little too premature of a decision for my liking.</v>

80
00:04:45.540 --> 00:04:45.630
<v 1>[Inaudible].</v>

81
00:04:45.630 --> 00:04:48.120
<v 0>And then put on sunglasses and leave dude out the window.</v>

82
00:04:51.570 --> 00:04:52.200
<v 1>[Inaudible].</v>

83
00:04:52.200 --> 00:04:54.120
<v 0>Man, that Epstein was trash. Huh?</v>

84
00:04:58.050 --> 00:05:02.790
There's other too. And that, that the documentary never told us who it was.

85
00:05:02.791 --> 00:05:06.660
They just showed pictures. They said one thing about the Prince guy.

86
00:05:06.930 --> 00:05:10.860
And then one thing about, uh, uh, bill Clinton.

87
00:05:11.010 --> 00:05:13.320
And then they showed one picture of Chris Tucker. And I'm like,

88
00:05:13.350 --> 00:05:16.980
Oh the duo who did it? I want to know the other people that were in it,

89
00:05:18.360 --> 00:05:20.550
jerking off a massage tables with high school kid.

90
00:05:20.580 --> 00:05:24.090
I want to know about these do the whole thing ended. And it was like,

91
00:05:24.320 --> 00:05:27.210
I w w we all looked at each other and we were like, what the, man,

92
00:05:27.780 --> 00:05:30.030
we don't get to know who else did it expose these?

93
00:05:30.720 --> 00:05:34.260
All they said so many different times. They were like, Oh, well we don't know.

94
00:05:34.620 --> 00:05:36.870
Uh, w well, yeah, there were tons of other high profile,

95
00:05:37.110 --> 00:05:40.590
high profile people that, that, that, that tried to that me.

96
00:05:40.740 --> 00:05:43.800
And when I was 14 and then, and then they were,

97
00:05:44.020 --> 00:05:45.900
and they would like show people on a plane and you'd be like, Oh yeah,

98
00:05:45.901 --> 00:05:48.360
there's Kevin Spacey. But did he do it? But say it, but did he do it,

99
00:05:48.361 --> 00:05:51.480
but say it, Oh, there's a picture of Chris Tucker. But do it say it,

100
00:05:52.110 --> 00:05:54.750
bill Clinton, did he do it? Say, Oh, he was on the Island. Oh,

101
00:05:54.751 --> 00:05:57.410
he said he wasn't, but he was on the Island 26 times. Okay.

102
00:05:57.411 --> 00:06:01.970
But did it do it say it because you're saying Jeffrey Epstein, did it tell us,

103
00:06:01.971 --> 00:06:05.330
man, that's why I'm watching the documentary. I'm here for the juice beds.

104
00:06:06.110 --> 00:06:07.340
I want to know, dude.

105
00:06:11.260 --> 00:06:12.820
I want to know if Chris Taka was like,

106
00:06:20.200 --> 00:06:21.340
Shut off color.

107
00:06:31.450 --> 00:06:33.640
The worst impression of all time. Towelie

108
00:06:36.340 --> 00:06:38.830
Why is it about Chris Ducker impression? Tally, dude,

109
00:06:43.840 --> 00:06:45.880
I want to do it. If they had one scene where it's like,

110
00:06:45.881 --> 00:06:48.720
and then Chris Tucker went like this, God you're supposed to come.

111
00:06:49.960 --> 00:06:54.520
[inaudible] I would have been like, okay, worth it. The four episodes worth it.

112
00:06:55.090 --> 00:06:58.330
You know how many pictures of the house they showed?

113
00:06:58.331 --> 00:07:00.010
And the Jeffrey Epstein documentary.

114
00:07:00.730 --> 00:07:05.590
So many pictures of them have a tracking shot of his West

115
00:07:05.591 --> 00:07:09.100
Palm beach house. I don't give a about that. Show me more pictures in the plane.

116
00:07:11.080 --> 00:07:15.760
You hinted at bill Clinton. You hinted at Kevin Spacey. Yeah. You said it,

117
00:07:16.090 --> 00:07:17.920
the Prince dude did it. The Andrew Prince guy.

118
00:07:18.820 --> 00:07:22.540
And you show one picture of Chris Ducker and you think that's a FYSEP.

119
00:07:25.300 --> 00:07:26.133
<v 1>Shimmy. My picks.</v>

120
00:07:27.730 --> 00:07:31.480
<v 0>So more people who, who did</v>

121
00:07:33.460 --> 00:07:38.230
hit chicks, who are women now? Who did let me know, dude,

122
00:07:39.280 --> 00:07:44.140
I would be that guy, man. I am a tattletale. Yeah,

123
00:07:44.170 --> 00:07:47.170
dude. That's why I respect that 69 Kerr planche guy.

124
00:07:49.060 --> 00:07:53.440
Cause he was just like, Oh. I'm caught.

125
00:07:55.000 --> 00:07:59.110
Well, they were like, well, if you tell us and he was like, stop right there.

126
00:07:59.650 --> 00:08:04.120
It was Dave. And they were like, okay,

127
00:08:04.210 --> 00:08:08.980
well you're, you're free. Cool. I'll be rich now. Hell yeah.

128
00:08:08.981 --> 00:08:11.710
Snitched. Oh, hell yeah. I snitched dude,

129
00:08:17.710 --> 00:08:20.020
man. I think about that. How many bacons things so many times,

130
00:08:20.021 --> 00:08:21.100
I know I've told you guys about that,

131
00:08:21.101 --> 00:08:23.440
but when I was in a place called Bergeys and locking you out,

132
00:08:23.441 --> 00:08:25.750
I would go and I would get the tuna melt and I would say, Hey,

133
00:08:25.751 --> 00:08:28.600
can I get bacon on it? And the guy would always say, sure, how many bacons?

134
00:08:28.660 --> 00:08:31.240
And I, I think about that every time,

135
00:08:33.250 --> 00:08:35.980
how many bacons and I cooked bacon every morning because my girl won't do it.

136
00:08:36.100 --> 00:08:39.640
And I make how many bacons through your eight? Three or four?

137
00:08:39.670 --> 00:08:43.780
Why did I say eight? Oh, cool. Good. Cool. Got it tomorrow. All good. Oh,

138
00:08:43.900 --> 00:08:45.310
that's all good. Did someone call the doctor? I have a tumor.

139
00:08:45.311 --> 00:08:49.780
I said eight instead of four sauce. All good after three, by the way. Oh.
