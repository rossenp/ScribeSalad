00:00:00.750 --> 00:00:04.110
<v 0>Hey guys, it's time for the most up Instagram post of the week.</v>

2
00:00:08.570 --> 00:00:09.403
<v 1>[Inaudible].</v>

3
00:00:09.920 --> 00:00:12.950
<v 0>All right, dude. Now this one is amazing. Okay.</v>

4
00:00:13.450 --> 00:00:17.960
Is this just a guy who is so now picture this guy he's

5
00:00:17.961 --> 00:00:21.350
standing near a no he's I don't know if he's sitting or standing as a selfie,

6
00:00:21.650 --> 00:00:26.000
but he's videoing himself near a kangaroo, the kangaroos in the background,

7
00:00:26.030 --> 00:00:27.890
just being a kangaroo. Okay.

8
00:00:28.370 --> 00:00:31.520
And it's a video and the caption is pure amazement.

9
00:00:31.730 --> 00:00:34.940
So that's what this guy is right now. This is what this guy is saying.

10
00:00:35.060 --> 00:00:37.250
I'm just going to play the video for you. And,

11
00:00:37.790 --> 00:00:42.440
and he has got to be a hundred

12
00:00:42.441 --> 00:00:46.970
percent high if he's not, it's even better. Okay.

13
00:00:47.360 --> 00:00:48.410
This is what he says.

14
00:00:52.310 --> 00:00:55.220
<v 2>He talks about these moments in which you experience a fresh,</v>

15
00:00:55.250 --> 00:00:59.990
the hardly bearable ecstasy of direct energy exploding on our nerve endings.

16
00:00:59.991 --> 00:01:04.220
He's of course, referring to a Holy moment. Auto ranks, Mysterium tremendum.

17
00:01:04.221 --> 00:01:08.330
If I see no Assam, as Tim duty wrote during these moments of,

18
00:01:08.900 --> 00:01:11.720
in which we utter extrapolations of amazement,

19
00:01:11.721 --> 00:01:16.640
we get to recontextualize the self as a marvelous conduit and a timeless

20
00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:20.900
hole from which molecules and meanings flow from neurons to Nebula.

21
00:01:21.050 --> 00:01:25.730
And back again, we transcend the been there's and done that. So the adult mind,

22
00:01:25.731 --> 00:01:28.670
we wake into our common ecstasy. We.

23
00:01:45.470 --> 00:01:46.303
<v 1>Yet.</v>

24
00:01:50.780 --> 00:01:53.950
<v 0>[Inaudible] [inaudible].</v>

25
00:01:56.190 --> 00:01:58.220
<v 1>Google extrapolations.</v>

00:02:00.710 --> 00:02:02.780
<v 0>It's stack you lay patients.</v>

27
00:02:05.350 --> 00:02:07.820
<v 1>I mean, literally.</v>

28
00:02:08.630 --> 00:02:13.250
<v 0>Your search extrapolations did not match any documents.</v>

29
00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:16.040
Have you ever Googled something? That's never.

30
00:02:17.690 --> 00:02:21.140
<v 1>Had results? What a</v>

31
00:02:23.450 --> 00:02:27.830
half hard this guy is, dude,

32
00:02:28.880 --> 00:02:31.460
this guy's gotten laid. You know.

33
00:02:32.960 --> 00:02:35.150
<v 0>Guy has had a conversation in business.</v>

34
00:02:36.500 --> 00:02:37.333
<v 1>He's standing.</v>

35
00:02:43.700 --> 00:02:44.590
I mean, what is.

36
00:02:44.780 --> 00:02:49.340
<v 0>Is this guy saying? And he laughs like, he's making a joke. Like he's like,</v>

37
00:02:50.240 --> 00:02:53.300
like he like, yo dude, what are we going to play again?

38
00:02:55.220 --> 00:02:58.040
<v 2>It talks about these moments in which you experience a fresh,</v>

39
00:02:58.070 --> 00:03:02.800
the hardly bearable of direct energy exploding on our nerve endings.

40
00:03:02.890 --> 00:03:07.030
He is of course, referring to a Holy moment. Auto ranks, Mysterium tremendum.

41
00:03:07.031 --> 00:03:11.110
If I see no Assam as Tim duty wrote during these moments of,

42
00:03:11.710 --> 00:03:14.020
in which we utter extrapolations of a mate,

43
00:03:15.160 --> 00:03:19.810
recontextualize the self as a marvelous conduit in the timeless hole,

44
00:03:19.811 --> 00:03:23.710
from which molecules and meanings flow from neurons to Nebula.

45
00:03:23.860 --> 00:03:28.540
And back again, we transcend the been there's and done that. So the adult mind,

46
00:03:28.541 --> 00:03:31.480
we awaken to our common ecstasy. We.

47
00:03:33.720 --> 00:03:38.460
<v 0>It really means nothing. Does that mean anything? What does this guy think?</v>

48
00:03:38.461 --> 00:03:43.110
It means literally expecting extrapolations and transcending the been

49
00:03:43.111 --> 00:03:45.480
there's and done that tend to have knots in the world.

50
00:03:46.200 --> 00:03:50.140
Timothy Kozinski wrote, uh, a.

51
00:03:54.390 --> 00:03:57.330
<v 2>Where he talks about these moments in which you experience a fresh,</v>

52
00:03:57.360 --> 00:03:59.730

<v 2>Three it's a fresh,</v>

58
00:04:17.820 --> 00:04:22.740
the hardly bearable ecstasy of direct energy exploding on our nerve endings he's

59
00:04:22.741 --> 00:04:24.600
of course, referring to a Holy man.

60
00:04:25.230 --> 00:04:29.340
<v 0>Anytime someone says, of course like that he's of course referring to you're a,</v>

61
00:04:29.670 --> 00:04:30.540
such a dude

62
00:04:34.800 --> 00:04:37.560
IX violations of amazement.

63
00:04:39.750 --> 00:04:42.420
Have you guys ever experienced extrapolations of amazement.

64
00:04:44.100 --> 00:04:47.700
<v 2>Timothy Leary talks about these moments in which you experience a fresh,</v>

65
00:04:47.730 --> 00:04:52.680
the hardly bearable ecstasy of direct energy exploding on our nerve endings he's

66
00:04:52.681 --> 00:04:56.700
of course, referring to a Holy moment. Auto ranks Mysterium tremendum.

67
00:04:56.730 --> 00:05:01.560
If I see Newsome as Tim duty wrote during these moments in

68
00:05:01.561 --> 00:05:04.170
which we utter extrapolations of amazement.

69
00:05:04.410 --> 00:05:07.110
<v 0>In which we utter [inaudible] of amazement,</v>

70
00:05:08.650 --> 00:05:09.630
let's see what else this guy say.

71
00:05:09.780 --> 00:05:11.670
<v 2>That's fair. And then I'm having kind of an amazing moment.</v>

72
00:05:11.700 --> 00:05:14.010
Why don't you introduce yourself? You know, guys,

73
00:05:17.070 --> 00:05:21.480
Talia's from Columbia guys and we were just having a conversation about, uh,

74
00:05:21.570 --> 00:05:25.470
you find what you need to find in life when you need to find it right.

75
00:05:25.471 --> 00:05:28.260
And whatever, when you're looking for something and you need to hear it,

76
00:05:28.560 --> 00:05:30.510
it tends to show up.

77
00:05:31.050 --> 00:05:35.970
And that was telling me that she discovered shots of awe during a time in her

78
00:05:35.971 --> 00:05:36.360
life,

79
00:05:36.360 --> 00:05:41.280
when she was really kind of hungry for some kind of answer or

80
00:05:41.281 --> 00:05:42.114
something, right?

81
00:05:44.670 --> 00:05:47.280
<v 0>This guy, smile, dude, what a,</v>

82
00:05:48.660 --> 00:05:49.710
what is ha.

83
00:05:54.540 --> 00:05:56.730
<v 2>I am interested in psychodynamics.</v>

84
00:05:56.731 --> 00:06:00.830
I'm in how different places and spaces and people,

85
00:06:00.831 --> 00:06:05.240
everything you have to take into account with your sensory apparatus informs

86
00:06:05.241 --> 00:06:07.550
your subjectivity. In other words,

87
00:06:07.820 --> 00:06:12.740
your experience has to take into account where you are and who you're with,

88
00:06:12.770 --> 00:06:15.590
right? You become what you behold, as McKenna said,

89
00:06:15.620 --> 00:06:19.700
we are the sum of the people that will spend the most amount of time with.

90
00:06:20.030 --> 00:06:24.170
But if we're interested in creating spaces for contemplate of

91
00:06:24.171 --> 00:06:25.040
introspection,

92
00:06:25.041 --> 00:06:29.360
if we want to search the worlds within and without,

93
00:06:29.570 --> 00:06:32.450
we need to be craftsmen of our fate,

94
00:06:32.660 --> 00:06:36.170
we need to filter out the wrong crowd.

95
00:06:36.350 --> 00:06:40.730
We need to customize our spaces and places to

96
00:06:40.970 --> 00:06:45.650
unfold. This is experience design, take into account,

97
00:06:45.680 --> 00:06:48.020
the psychodynamics of people and places.

98
00:07:03.170 --> 00:07:04.003
<v 1>[Inaudible].</v>

99
00:07:07.300 --> 00:07:11.500
<v 0>I mean, I have extrapolations of amazement right now.</v>

100
00:07:16.600 --> 00:07:17.433
<v 1>Okay.</v>

101
00:07:17.650 --> 00:07:22.330
<v 0>Just the way he's talking and just recharge is the lump sum</v>

102
00:07:22.360 --> 00:07:25.390
of whatever who we hang out with. Right?

103
00:07:25.450 --> 00:07:28.570
So what is [inaudible] about this whole

104
00:07:32.590 --> 00:07:36.310
[inaudible] is basically what, okay.

105
00:07:36.311 --> 00:07:41.230
So what Galileo has said was we're all walking him out around and amongst us,

106
00:07:41.231 --> 00:07:45.730
we have all the external hard drive of the mind,

107
00:07:45.760 --> 00:07:47.740
so to speak. It's what we do.

108
00:07:47.980 --> 00:07:52.840
We plug into the extra terrestrial is somewhat of a

109
00:07:52.841 --> 00:07:54.700
dark matter.

110
00:07:55.480 --> 00:07:58.030
I've been laid four times.

111
00:08:00.520 --> 00:08:04.540
That guy probably gets so much [inaudible] plus

112
00:08:06.190 --> 00:08:10.630
dude, I could, I here's the thing about me.

113
00:08:10.690 --> 00:08:15.670
I can listen to this guy all day and just be laughing and

114
00:08:15.671 --> 00:08:20.200
crying and loving it. Now I know that a lot of you guys are like, all right,

115
00:08:20.201 --> 00:08:24.280
this guy, come on, man. Don't, come on. Talk about other things,

116
00:08:24.430 --> 00:08:26.170
but how can I do that?

117
00:08:31.390 --> 00:08:32.890
<v 1>There's this guy.</v>

118
00:08:36.580 --> 00:08:37.900
<v 0>How can I do that?</v>

119
00:08:45.100 --> 00:08:45.933
Oh, this guy.

120
00:08:49.690 --> 00:08:54.220
I liked this guy. I liked this guy.

121
00:08:55.710 --> 00:08:58.590
I actually liked this guy. No irony.

122
00:08:59.360 --> 00:09:03.620
<v 2>It's a great quote that says, when information is cheap,</v>

123
00:09:04.070 --> 00:09:08.960
attention becomes expensive. And of course, in the age of social media,

124
00:09:08.961 --> 00:09:13.040
in the age of the internet, we are drowning in information.

125
00:09:13.041 --> 00:09:16.640
Every two days, we create more data than in all of human history.

126
00:09:16.641 --> 00:09:19.880
Up until that point. So information is cheap.

127
00:09:19.910 --> 00:09:23.450
Therefore attention has become expensive.

128
00:09:23.451 --> 00:09:28.160
The currency of our age is attention. Attention is the new oil.

129
00:09:28.161 --> 00:09:30.590
If you can retain eyeballs,

130
00:09:30.620 --> 00:09:35.150
if you can hold on to people's focal points for even a minute and a

131
00:09:35.151 --> 00:09:40.130
half, you are golden. And so the question becomes,

132
00:09:40.160 --> 00:09:42.380
how do we cure rate our attention?

133
00:09:43.010 --> 00:09:46.460
How do we discern mindful?

134
00:09:46.670 --> 00:09:51.650
He apply this scarce resource because it is scarcity

135
00:09:51.710 --> 00:09:52.790
of our own attention.

136
00:09:52.791 --> 00:09:56.780
How do we not let people hijack into practice?

137
00:09:56.781 --> 00:09:58.730
A kind of curatorial mind?

138
00:10:06.120 --> 00:10:10.850
<v 0>Is he saying it like it's Shakespeare? Why is he saying it?</v>

139
00:10:10.851 --> 00:10:14.540
Like he's in a Oh for sake, dude.

140
00:10:15.830 --> 00:10:20.720
Oh. I gotta hang out with this guy, dude. Here's the thing, man.

141
00:10:22.610 --> 00:10:26.330
This is why I like this guy. You have to

142
00:10:28.550 --> 00:10:33.080
be passionate, man. Oh. This. Guy's blowing my mind.

143
00:10:33.081 --> 00:10:34.760
Not in the way he thinks he's blowing my mind.

144
00:10:34.880 --> 00:10:39.110
This guy is walking down Runyon Canyon,

145
00:10:39.111 --> 00:10:43.910
which is a hiking place in Hollywood doing these, these videos.

146
00:10:47.000 --> 00:10:48.950
I mean, he's saying nonsense words,

147
00:10:51.440 --> 00:10:54.530
this guy in a way,

148
00:10:56.270 --> 00:11:00.980
Oh man. Like you said to hold onto their focal point.

149
00:11:01.070 --> 00:11:05.450
And the best part is he thinks it's funny and he's laughing,

150
00:11:06.140 --> 00:11:11.060
dude. I can listen to this guy all day. God.

151
00:11:11.330 --> 00:11:14.840
And he's so passionate about this. I,

152
00:11:17.750 --> 00:11:21.320
Oh my God, this guy rocks. He gets a follow.
