<v 1>Ah, dude, this is my life</v>

60
00:04:11.880 --> 00:04:15.540
I get why? Listen to this podcast to be brutally honest. I always say,

61
00:04:15.541 --> 00:04:19.560
I don't know why I listen, but I get why. Cause I'm loosey goosey dude,

62
00:04:19.890 --> 00:04:23.640
or we're having a silly goose time and you want to have that silly goose time,

63
00:04:23.790 --> 00:04:26.910
but maybe you can't have that silly goose time because you got rules and you've

64
00:04:26.911 --> 00:04:28.410
got work and you're sitting at a cubicle,

65
00:04:28.470 --> 00:04:30.540
but I'll have the silly goose time for you.

66
00:04:30.660 --> 00:04:34.980
And you listened to me and secretly just think about this dude. Secretly,

67
00:04:35.070 --> 00:04:37.440
maybe you're with your family. Maybe you got your AirPods in at the gym.

68
00:04:37.530 --> 00:04:39.930
Maybe you're at your cubicle. Maybe you're at a function.

69
00:04:40.020 --> 00:04:42.840
And maybe you're listening to congratulations. Maybe you're listening to me,

70
00:04:42.900 --> 00:04:46.380
but guess what dude, inside your heart,

71
00:04:46.440 --> 00:04:50.340
inside that inside of your heart, inside the compartment of your,

72
00:04:50.550 --> 00:04:54.360
like when I was a kid, I used to have a dream, a recurring dream and yeah,

73
00:04:54.390 --> 00:04:59.370
it was weird dude that I go to sleep and then did I dream waking up and then

74
00:04:59.371 --> 00:05:02.700
walking into my basement in New Jersey and walking into the laundry room and

75
00:05:02.701 --> 00:05:04.710
then walking into a secret compartment into the laundry room.

76
00:05:04.770 --> 00:05:08.730
And there was a seance. Yes. Did I even know what a sands was when I was seven?

77
00:05:08.790 --> 00:05:13.650
No, but somehow dreamt it up there to Christ. However,

78
00:05:14.220 --> 00:05:18.960
in that part of your heart in the you fall asleep and dream part of your heart

79
00:05:19.350 --> 00:05:20.820
in the basement,

80
00:05:20.821 --> 00:05:24.720
part of your heart in the inside of the secret compartment,

81
00:05:24.750 --> 00:05:29.220
in the basement of your heart, that you dreamt up where you're having a science,

82
00:05:30.360 --> 00:05:32.670
I know you're having a silly goose time doing it.

83
00:05:34.950 --> 00:05:39.060
And I know maybe you can't live that way, but I'll have it for you.

84
00:05:40.230 --> 00:05:42.900
Listen to me. And we'll escape.

85
00:05:45.540 --> 00:05:48.030
We'll escape, dude. Me,

86
00:05:48.360 --> 00:05:52.470
you Jeremy Renner and a few bikini babes.

87
00:05:54.120 --> 00:05:57.740
And if you're a girl, I'll get some me.

88
00:05:57.741 --> 00:06:01.460
You uh, Jeremy Renner and um,

89
00:06:02.030 --> 00:06:06.830
some Argentinian guys, man, they're sexy. You ever see him?

90
00:06:07.490 --> 00:06:10.580
Argentinian men have the best chest hair dude. Cause it's like a little bit,

91
00:06:10.581 --> 00:06:13.250
but not too much. But when they work out, it looks good. Cause it's a little,

92
00:06:13.430 --> 00:06:17.240
a little sweaty, but not mad at dude. I'd Argentinian guy. I swear to God.

93
00:06:17.270 --> 00:06:18.260
If I was going to a guy,

94
00:06:18.261 --> 00:06:21.170
it would be our Argentinian and he'd be six feet and a little bit hairy.
