00:00:06.750 --> 00:00:09.630
I don't even know Kodak black.

3
00:00:11.430 --> 00:00:15.570
That's it? You're 14. You listen to Kodak black. That's it.

4
00:00:24.650 --> 00:00:26.000
<v 1>I put my heart on my lid.</v>

5
00:00:28.490 --> 00:00:32.030
<v 0>Dude. I put up a thing up about how I can't remember what it was,</v>

6
00:00:32.031 --> 00:00:35.300
but I was like, I wrote up, I wrote something that was like, Oh,

7
00:00:35.301 --> 00:00:37.250
I was talking about music.

8
00:00:37.370 --> 00:00:40.700
It was the post I did on Instagram about how I was like rapping.

9
00:00:40.760 --> 00:00:42.200
I love hip hop of today.

10
00:00:42.410 --> 00:00:44.630
And I basically was rapping over and I was just doing that.

11
00:01:12.650 --> 00:01:13.483
<v 1>[Inaudible].</v>

12
00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:17.210
<v 0>So, and then somebody writes, Oh, you're one of those guys.</v>

13
00:01:17.480 --> 00:01:22.220
And you know what I have to say to that? Your, right?

14
00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:25.403
<v 1>Oh.</v>

15
00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:29.060
<v 0>Dude. I'm not, not one of those guys.</v>

16
00:01:31.490 --> 00:01:32.570
<v 1>I hate.</v>

17
00:01:32.900 --> 00:01:34.850
<v 0>That. Vivid. The</v>

18
00:01:44.990 --> 00:01:46.340
[inaudible] Hey, y'all K

19
00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:50.990
Be www digit.

20
00:01:59.150 --> 00:01:59.983
<v 1>I don't know.</v>

21
00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:08.630
<v 0>Like, and then, but there's people</v>

22
00:02:10.250 --> 00:02:14.060
that will be like, yo, he's talking real. That's the that kills me.

23
00:02:18.890 --> 00:02:19.723
<v 1>Um.</v>

24
00:02:20.840 --> 00:02:23.150
<v 0>What do any of these things mean? I'm old,</v>

25
00:02:26.210 --> 00:02:29.810
bro, to be honest, I don't think Kodak can ever make a bad song.

26
00:02:29.811 --> 00:02:32.030
Like if you agree, like somebody thinks that

27
00:02:35.660 --> 00:02:40.370
And then somebody else writes on God, I'm a like of this comment. What? Okay.

28
00:02:41.450 --> 00:02:44.030
Okay. Why you swear to God for that?

29
00:02:51.030 --> 00:02:54.080
Look at this. If you're reading this, I hope you never go broke again.

30
00:02:55.550 --> 00:02:59.680
Edit if you're broke. I hope you get rich. Thanks bud.

31
00:03:00.670 --> 00:03:02.320
You just did nothing.

32
00:03:04.150 --> 00:03:06.250
And some guy writes what happens if you're broke already? Huh?

33
00:03:08.320 --> 00:03:09.340
I guess that was before the edit.

34
00:03:13.680 --> 00:03:18.000
This chick Kodak can have beef with TEI or even Trump and I'll still listen to

35
00:03:18.001 --> 00:03:20.430
his music. That's an odd one.

36
00:03:25.050 --> 00:03:25.883
<v 1>Wow.</v>

37
00:03:28.830 --> 00:03:32.490
<v 0>I mean, he's got such a fan base. That means family is way bigger than mine.</v>

38
00:03:32.491 --> 00:03:35.100
So I guess I'm the idiot. I made it.

39
00:03:42.540 --> 00:03:47.160
I don't get it. Cause anybody could do this. That's the thing I don't get

40
00:03:48.720 --> 00:03:53.490
and producing the music. Cause then, okay. But he's not though. Right?

41
00:03:53.491 --> 00:03:58.380
He's just rapping. Anybody can do this for real. And I know people are like, no,

42
00:03:58.381 --> 00:04:03.240
but they can't but you can. Yeah, you can. I can do that. I can do that.

43
00:04:04.590 --> 00:04:08.730
I can do exactly. I can do that. That's it

44
00:04:10.260 --> 00:04:11.093
I'm caught at black.

45
00:04:13.020 --> 00:04:16.290
If you like how in a rail it'd be like, how on the chair?

46
00:04:16.960 --> 00:04:21.000

00:06:53.290 --> 00:06:53.710
<v 1>[Inaudible].</v>

79
00:06:53.710 --> 00:06:54.880
<v 0>They're just like we quit, man.</v>

80
00:06:54.910 --> 00:06:58.420
That's the worst thing I've ever heard in my life to even talk about.

81
00:07:03.670 --> 00:07:06.520
I put my heart and my lyrics. My mama told me she hear it.

82
00:07:06.790 --> 00:07:10.390
I'd done seen death in effort. Only for God. It must be cut off.

83
00:07:10.480 --> 00:07:13.900
Our home is the envy. I can't say that part will change for a penny.

84
00:07:14.410 --> 00:07:17.890
Hang by my seven. Got Manny. All right. You know,

85
00:07:22.300 --> 00:07:26.080
That's funny, man. Like people actually these lyrics are really deep.

86
00:07:27.190 --> 00:07:30.220
I mean, obviously I'm making a joke. I'm, I understand. It's more.

87
00:07:30.580 --> 00:07:35.110
He's actually trying to put like, dude, I put my heart in my lyrics.

88
00:07:35.111 --> 00:07:39.070
He's the first guy ever to say that? No, my had told me she hear it. Okay.

89
00:07:39.880 --> 00:07:41.980
All right. I done seen death in eight ferret.

90
00:07:42.370 --> 00:07:46.240
Literally every rapper says that only fear God and my spirit.

91
00:07:47.920 --> 00:07:52.180
I mean, so many times cut off old homeys that envy.

92
00:07:53.080 --> 00:07:55.600
I mean, this is about every rap song is about this so far.

93
00:07:57.850 --> 00:08:01.600
And people are like, God, that's deep. Okay.

94
00:08:02.770 --> 00:08:04.720
And by the way, I'm not a hater.

95
00:08:04.990 --> 00:08:09.460
I'm talking to because of what Kodak black did about the Nipsey hustle.

96
00:08:09.610 --> 00:08:13.990
That's why. Cause that is not cool, dude.

97
00:08:16.280 --> 00:08:20.890
The lowest kind of guy is the kind of guy that did what that dude did for Nipsey

98
00:08:21.130 --> 00:08:23.560
house when he died. And he was like, I'm a holler at his girl.

99
00:08:23.770 --> 00:08:27.880
That is the most boy cook.

100
00:08:29.290 --> 00:08:33.820
That is the worst. Somebody in your

101
00:08:36.760 --> 00:08:39.040
Industry dies.

102
00:08:39.250 --> 00:08:43.990
And you want to holler at his girl because you think she's fine or fly your, uh,

103
00:08:44.050 --> 00:08:47.140
your, your, the, in my eyes. That's the worst kind of guy.

104
00:08:47.200 --> 00:08:49.870
That's the worst kind of guy. So you're a cook.

105
00:08:50.740 --> 00:08:54.400
And that's why I'm talking about all this. Otherwise art is art.
