00:00:00.090 --> 00:00:01.800
<v 0>One time. Oh, man. One time I was playing a,</v>

2
00:00:02.910 --> 00:00:07.830
I must've been 21 and I was beefy, dude, when I was 21, I was beefy.

3
00:00:08.520 --> 00:00:11.910
You think the Lord of the rings have a place to shoot right now, bro.

4
00:00:12.570 --> 00:00:15.750
Forget that they did all those movies back then. Okay.

5
00:00:15.990 --> 00:00:20.040
Right on the back of my shoulders, I would hear way in the background.

6
00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:22.733
Oh yeah. That's right.

7
00:00:23.850 --> 00:00:28.410
And dude like Eduardo Lafonda Carbone could do Revenant back here,

8
00:00:28.411 --> 00:00:32.520
Revenant too. T O O Revenant also.

9
00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:38.580
Uh, and so, uh, I was with my buddy who is,

10
00:00:39.330 --> 00:00:44.250
hilarious intentionally and also unintentionally like one time we

11
00:00:44.251 --> 00:00:47.430
were talking about one time we were talking, we were, I was probably 23.

12
00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:49.620
This is before, this is the, after I'm doing it like pulp fiction,

13
00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:51.570
I'm doing a little bit here and then I'm going back a little bit.

14
00:00:51.571 --> 00:00:56.310
And then you find out I was dead at the end. Um, so he was like, he was like,

15
00:00:56.670 --> 00:01:00.740
uh, Hey, uh, you know,

16
00:01:00.741 --> 00:01:04.080
he wasn't really getting chicks the way he, he, he wanted to get check seat.

17
00:01:04.180 --> 00:01:09.110
He wasn't getting late and he wanted to get late. Cause he was a 25,

18
00:01:09.110 --> 00:01:14.000
6 something, you know what I mean? And one time he was like,

19
00:01:14.420 --> 00:01:18.290
I was like, well, why don't you just like hit on, not as hot chicks, you know,

20
00:01:18.291 --> 00:01:22.670
you might have a better chance and this way you work your confidence up and then

21
00:01:22.671 --> 00:01:26.450
you start hitting, hitting, hitting on in and hook it up with the hotter chicks.

22
00:01:26.810 --> 00:01:27.501
And he was like,

23
00:01:27.501 --> 00:01:30.140
and he was getting so frustrated at the time and he would always do this.

24
00:01:30.141 --> 00:01:33.110
That's how I learned that this is. He and he said, and dude,

25
00:01:33.111 --> 00:01:36.530
I'll never forget this. He said, I said.

26
00:01:37.010 --> 00:01:39.970
<v 1>I will not hook up with some substandard girls.</v>

27
00:01:39.971 --> 00:01:42.490
I will not talk up with some standard girls and do it.

28
00:01:42.520 --> 00:01:46.420
And I will never forget that I will not hook her up with some standard girls and

29
00:01:46.421 --> 00:01:47.200
do it. And I was.

30
00:01:47.200 --> 00:01:52.090
<v 0>Like, ah, I think that was the first time I went up and uh, it was awesome.</v>

31
00:01:52.960 --> 00:01:56.980
And I laughed and that guy hasn't been laid in two years now.

32
00:01:57.010 --> 00:02:01.390
And this is 20 years later. I just talked to him, sadness.

33
00:02:03.880 --> 00:02:07.360
<v 1>Real life sadness. You think going on, dude, you think people are,</v>

34
00:02:07.660 --> 00:02:11.230
you think what? Corona, the economy, you think that this everything up.

35
00:02:11.260 --> 00:02:15.160
My buddy hasn't gotten laid for two years. Sadness,

36
00:02:19.840 --> 00:02:20.830
sadness.

37
00:02:23.380 --> 00:02:26.680
<v 0>Um, you know what I mean? Like that's, that's brutally, but you know,</v>

38
00:02:27.400 --> 00:02:30.910
I guess it's the kind of thing. Like one time when I was in a, uh, uh, carpool,

39
00:02:30.970 --> 00:02:32.530
I used to be carpool going as a kid,

40
00:02:32.770 --> 00:02:36.190
going to school with a kid with a bunch of different kids in a van with that

41
00:02:37.090 --> 00:02:38.500
siding. That was like a wooden siding.

42
00:02:39.280 --> 00:02:42.070
<v 1>Whoever put cars with the wooden siding on the outside. It's like,</v>

43
00:02:42.071 --> 00:02:46.240
what are you making a car or a house? What is the breaking bad? How a mobile?

44
00:02:46.960 --> 00:02:51.340
<v 0>So one time and the kid, the older kid, he said, yeah, I don't really watch TV.</v>

45
00:02:51.341 --> 00:02:53.050
I said, really? He said, yeah, because one time I was granted,

46
00:02:53.051 --> 00:02:54.310
I couldn't watch TV all summer.

47
00:02:54.430 --> 00:02:56.680
And then I just came in and got into the habit and never really wanted to watch

48
00:02:56.681 --> 00:02:57.250
TV.

49
00:02:57.250 --> 00:02:59.680
And that's what's happened with my buddy only when it happens do with getting

50
00:02:59.681 --> 00:03:04.030
his Dick wet. And I'll tell you what, that is 100% not sensational. So yeah,

51
00:03:05.440 --> 00:03:08.040
that is absolutely not sensation. That is absolutely not.

52
00:03:11.760 --> 00:03:14.340
Um, anyway, let's see. I was telling him, okay,

53
00:03:14.341 --> 00:03:16.650
so this is what I was going back to it. Like I go back, back, back. My,

54
00:03:16.770 --> 00:03:19.350
my is steps. I went a little bit forward. I went back into it's like time cop,

55
00:03:19.351 --> 00:03:22.050
you go back and forth or pulp fiction just in a different editing way.

56
00:03:22.080 --> 00:03:24.360
So my time travels.

57
00:03:27.450 --> 00:03:32.340
Okay. So, um, thought I just stepped in dog. Uh,

58
00:03:32.341 --> 00:03:34.200
so, uh, anyway,

59
00:03:34.201 --> 00:03:38.220
we were doing this thing S game with a bunch of girls and guys

60
00:03:39.600 --> 00:03:43.890
and uh, my buddy,

61
00:03:44.370 --> 00:03:49.320
we had to hum a song like the first few seconds of a

62
00:03:49.321 --> 00:03:52.440
song. And then whoever guessed it got a point or some,

63
00:03:52.830 --> 00:03:55.350
whatever it was the worst game of all time.

64
00:03:56.910 --> 00:04:00.030
And we couldn't do the lyrics. Like you couldn't be out there and just be like.

65
00:04:00.150 --> 00:04:02.480
<v 1>I'll put this up right in the front window advertisement right in the front</v>

66
00:04:02.481 --> 00:04:04.790
window. And all of a sudden success coming out of the blue,

67
00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:06.290
because then you'd be like mush, Nick and son.

68
00:04:07.210 --> 00:04:08.290
<v 0>Of course. Right. So,</v>

69
00:04:09.490 --> 00:04:12.340
so this guy was going to sing this song.

70
00:04:15.490 --> 00:04:18.730
This guy was going to sing the song downtown. Right.

71
00:04:22.870 --> 00:04:25.670
[inaudible] Downtown. Right? Whatever the that song is,

72
00:04:25.671 --> 00:04:29.810
that was probably in some Dustin Hoffman movie in 1981. So.

73
00:04:31.870 --> 00:04:36.680
<v 1>Rent that [inaudible] downtown. Right.</v>

74
00:04:37.430 --> 00:04:40.880
And it was his turn and that was the song you wanted to sing. Okay.

75
00:04:42.410 --> 00:04:46.340
This is the most submit ever. Okay. There was a chin up bar behind him.

76
00:04:46.610 --> 00:04:48.770
<v 0>All right. In the room. Okay.</v>

77
00:04:51.380 --> 00:04:56.150
<v 1>Oh. This dude. There was a chin up bar behind him and he was, it was his Rosa.</v>

78
00:04:56.180 --> 00:05:00.960
Okay, go ahead. And he goes [inaudible]

79
00:05:06.870 --> 00:05:11.600
he goes, no, no, no, no, no,

80
00:05:11.601 --> 00:05:15.350
no. Um, and then he goes downtown and

81
00:05:17.270 --> 00:05:19.280
started crying.

82
00:05:19.460 --> 00:05:23.780
The only thing he got to do was not say downtown. And he goes downtown.

83
00:05:23.870 --> 00:05:25.640
And we, my other buddy and I,

84
00:05:25.730 --> 00:05:28.880
who we looked at each other immediate beat red faces.

85
00:05:28.910 --> 00:05:30.890
And we started crying like Japan animation.

86
00:05:31.070 --> 00:05:35.480
And then my buddy got embarrassed that he said the word downtown that he

87
00:05:36.500 --> 00:05:40.100
pivoted did a, it was like he was Tony Gwynn swinging the bat.

88
00:05:40.130 --> 00:05:44.960
He just twisted and walked over to the chin-up bar

89
00:05:45.260 --> 00:05:47.900
and grabbed it and did two chin-ups.

90
00:05:50.750 --> 00:05:54.830
He did two chin-ups dude out of

91
00:05:55.010 --> 00:05:56.150
bitchiness.

92
00:05:57.240 --> 00:06:02.180
Imagine being so insecure and some that he was

93
00:06:02.181 --> 00:06:04.550
doing the twist here when he was singing, he was going downtown.

94
00:06:04.551 --> 00:06:07.040
And then he realized he did it. We started Japan, animation crying.

95
00:06:07.250 --> 00:06:11.000
And he posted, walked on over. He didn't run. He walked like fast walk.

96
00:06:11.001 --> 00:06:12.770
Like he saw something that he wanted at the mall, real,

97
00:06:12.920 --> 00:06:17.720
not really like really quickly. And then he just did two chin-ups and the,

98
00:06:17.780 --> 00:06:19.640
oh my God, dude, I was.

99
00:06:20.360 --> 00:06:25.330
<v 0>2300. That was a. That guy hasn't been laid in two years. He didn't listen.</v>

100
00:06:27.790 --> 00:06:28.880
<v 2>He didn't listen, you know,</v>

101
00:06:29.020 --> 00:06:33.340
would probably do live for the congratulations podcast. This is episode 1 68.

102
00:06:33.341 --> 00:06:36.850
Make sure to check out Krista Lee, no paid non Netflix.

103
00:06:40.540 --> 00:06:44.590
<v 0>Too loud. Had it too loud in my headphones. That was the Jeremy Renner sting.</v>
