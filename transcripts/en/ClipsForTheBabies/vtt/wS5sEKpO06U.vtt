43
00:03:10.291 --> 00:03:13.110
I take, I try to take care of myself. I obviously understand, you know,

44
00:03:13.111 --> 00:03:17.610
I'm lucky I got a fast metabolism, but I also work out very hard. Okay. But bro,

45
00:03:18.150 --> 00:03:22.890
I eat sometimes till I feel you ever eat so much

46
00:03:23.220 --> 00:03:27.750
that you feel so gross where you feel like, you know,

47
00:03:27.751 --> 00:03:30.870
what would top it off? Just getting a dirty suck.

48
00:03:32.580 --> 00:03:36.480
You know what I'm talking about? If, if, if I was, if I so much,

49
00:03:36.720 --> 00:03:40.980
I was so fat that I just sat here and got a dirty suck.

50
00:03:44.370 --> 00:03:49.110
Like after I buy some like, you know,

51
00:03:49.770 --> 00:03:51.630
some like a lawyer,

52
00:03:52.680 --> 00:03:55.770
just a dirty suck from a female lawyer, you know,

53
00:03:56.070 --> 00:03:57.780
that's how much I eat.

54
00:03:59.100 --> 00:04:03.720
I eat so much that I would just sit in a curvy position on my

55
00:04:03.721 --> 00:04:06.360
couch with my Tommy out.

56
00:04:06.720 --> 00:04:11.250
Just getting a dirty suck from a lawyer brow.

57
00:04:12.300 --> 00:04:16.770
That's how much I eat ni naked.

58
00:04:17.700 --> 00:04:20.940
I'll post them by the way. Postmates. Do it all.

59
00:04:20.970 --> 00:04:23.310
Uber eats it and they'll show up to my house.

60
00:04:23.400 --> 00:04:28.320
I'll eat all this with my naked as Dick flopping

61
00:04:28.321 --> 00:04:32.580
around. And then just imagine getting a dirty suck by the way.

62
00:04:32.640 --> 00:04:37.620
I'm not even horny. It's just about the eating. It's about the eating.

63
00:04:37.860 --> 00:04:39.660
It makes you feel better that you ate so much.

64
00:04:39.820 --> 00:04:44.670
You're like if I just get a dirty suck and watch like the

65
00:04:44.671 --> 00:04:49.560
strain on TV and start season in the middle of season

66
00:04:49.561 --> 00:04:52.290
three, just so much disrespect going on,

67
00:04:53.160 --> 00:04:57.630
just disrespect and everything. I'll eat Ali, all the, disrespect.

68
00:04:57.631 --> 00:05:01.620
My body. I'll get a dirty suck and disrespect my partner.

69
00:05:01.800 --> 00:05:03.480
And then watch the strain.

70
00:05:03.720 --> 00:05:07.260
Start with season three and disrespect,

71
00:05:07.380 --> 00:05:12.240
the producers and actors that have worked so hard creating the moment up

72
00:05:12.241 --> 00:05:13.230
until season three,

73
00:05:13.290 --> 00:05:17.580
but just start in the middle in the middle of a show

74
00:05:18.240 --> 00:05:22.920
in the middle of season three, episode five in the middle of it,

75
00:05:23.820 --> 00:05:26.940
just we're all of a sudden where they're like where the w where they're like,

76
00:05:27.120 --> 00:05:29.490
Oh, I don't know what to do. Now that we're surrounded.

77
00:05:29.491 --> 00:05:30.600
And you just start watching,

78
00:05:30.601 --> 00:05:33.510
imagine getting a dirty sock and you ate seven ice cream sandwiches and some

79
00:05:33.511 --> 00:05:34.344
pasta.

80
00:05:37.830 --> 00:05:42.780
It's good to have nights like that, man. I don't mean to be so inspiring,

81
00:05:42.810 --> 00:05:45.990
but it's good to have nights like that. You got to live a little one time.

82
00:05:45.991 --> 00:05:50.760
I saw the rock in an Instagram video, how he was like, I never had in and out,

83
00:05:50.880 --> 00:05:53.820
but I took my cast members to in and out and he drove through and they were

84
00:05:53.821 --> 00:05:54.810
like, Hey, it's the rock?

85
00:05:54.811 --> 00:05:58.340
And he got the burgers and he handed the burgers over for castmates and he

86
00:05:58.341 --> 00:06:02.420
didn't eat the burgers. I know, I know he has cheat days. I've seen it. But bro,

87
00:06:02.750 --> 00:06:05.570
if you drive through in and out, you get a burger,

88
00:06:08.120 --> 00:06:09.890
be disrespectful,

89
00:06:15.170 --> 00:06:18.170
dirty suck, man. They're in a sack there and it's not.
