00:00:00.690 --> 00:00:03.450
<v 0>I go to this. I hate having meetings at three arts dude.</v>

2
00:00:03.810 --> 00:00:07.830
That's my management company, because there's a guy and the valet

3
00:00:10.220 --> 00:00:13.490
where first of all, you don't need the valet guy.

4
00:00:13.760 --> 00:00:17.600
Anytime you there's a lot. And you don't need a valet guy.

5
00:00:19.670 --> 00:00:23.300
It's just like, no,

6
00:00:24.770 --> 00:00:27.890
no parking, it's fine. You've got another guy to do a job too.

7
00:00:27.891 --> 00:00:30.260
There's another one at this coffee place I go to.

8
00:00:30.680 --> 00:00:35.060
And it's so annoying that you get a ticket to get into the

9
00:00:35.390 --> 00:00:39.200
place. Both of these places you get there, ample parking spaces.

10
00:00:39.380 --> 00:00:42.560
And there's a guy in the coffee place. There's three guys.

11
00:00:42.590 --> 00:00:47.480
There's three guys in the structure and they're just sitting there and they stop

12
00:00:49.430 --> 00:00:53.690
and they stop you. All right. You're driving to the spot and they stop you.

13
00:00:53.691 --> 00:00:58.430
And they say, Hey, who are you here for? And I just say,

14
00:00:59.360 --> 00:01:04.010
I'm here to get coffee. And they go, okay, go up to the next level,

15
00:01:04.011 --> 00:01:08.930
which I already know, because it's closer to the coffee entrance.

16
00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:11.570
So then I get there. There's another guy there. And the guy says,

17
00:01:11.571 --> 00:01:14.420
where are you going? I said, I'm here to get coffee. And the guy says, okay,

18
00:01:14.421 --> 00:01:18.320
why don't you park right there and points to one of the spaces that are open.

19
00:01:18.321 --> 00:01:21.380
And there's like, 40 spaces open.

20
00:01:22.730 --> 00:01:26.420
I never parked in the one. He tells me because it's not, [inaudible] no matter

21
00:01:29.120 --> 00:01:31.910
if this guy is going to make the job

22
00:01:33.320 --> 00:01:37.700
more of it. G of a, of a inconvenience dude,

23
00:01:37.701 --> 00:01:40.280
when they get people does this. So something that would drive me nuts,

24
00:01:40.670 --> 00:01:43.400
people that help you when you don't need to be helped.

25
00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:45.920
I have a question for these guys,

26
00:01:46.310 --> 00:01:51.140
my and elderly lady or my young

27
00:01:51.320 --> 00:01:56.180
as, dude, I'm only 39.

28
00:01:57.050 --> 00:01:59.210
It's like crazy how young I am.

29
00:01:59.540 --> 00:02:04.400
I don't know if there's anybody younger than me and I'm driving in

30
00:02:06.050 --> 00:02:08.570
pray, proudly going Google Gaga.

31
00:02:10.940 --> 00:02:13.490
I'm so young. I constantly check for a diaper.

32
00:02:17.030 --> 00:02:19.550
I'm so young. I, my pants. And I say, it's okay.

33
00:02:19.551 --> 00:02:20.630
I haven't learned how to not do that.

34
00:02:23.690 --> 00:02:24.890
So young. I am.

35
00:02:26.660 --> 00:02:30.230
So you don't need to help me park dude,

36
00:02:33.650 --> 00:02:37.430
because there's so many spaces. Now, if it's a mess,

37
00:02:38.810 --> 00:02:41.690
if there's, you know, if parking is like,

38
00:02:43.310 --> 00:02:47.990
if there's so many different cars in the lot, like, ah,

39
00:02:48.950 --> 00:02:53.030
what's that where they put the,

40
00:02:53.930 --> 00:02:57.620
the duck and the chicken and the ham and the Turkey. And it's just like, dude,

41
00:02:57.930 --> 00:03:01.780
what, what are you doing? What that called? Turducken Hey,

42
00:03:02.470 --> 00:03:06.820
turducken go yourself, man. You know how that is?

43
00:03:07.930 --> 00:03:12.340
What's wrong with chicken? What's wrong with duck? What's our Turkey dude.

44
00:03:12.640 --> 00:03:15.040
Turducken is only okay if you put bubble gum in it too,

45
00:03:15.041 --> 00:03:17.770
and Pepto-Bismol otherwise I ain't eaten it, put it all in there,

46
00:03:17.800 --> 00:03:18.633
put it all in there.

47
00:03:18.820 --> 00:03:23.200
You know how it is to other animals that would just rip them apart and stuffed

48
00:03:23.201 --> 00:03:26.950
them in another animal and then eat it and then ship it out. We just go

49
00:03:29.200 --> 00:03:30.033
all out of our.

50
00:03:33.660 --> 00:03:37.710
So gross dude. That's like a Turkey would kill, uh,

51
00:03:38.890 --> 00:03:40.110
uh, think about what that would be like.

52
00:03:40.111 --> 00:03:43.080
If there were bigger beings out there like giants that would just kill all of

53
00:03:43.081 --> 00:03:45.060
us, white, black, Mexican, and Asian,

54
00:03:45.061 --> 00:03:47.160
and then just stuff all of us together and eat them.

55
00:03:47.700 --> 00:03:51.930
They put it all in a black guy and just eat it and they just call it

56
00:03:54.870 --> 00:03:57.620
white Blasian and they just, it

57
00:04:01.560 --> 00:04:04.530
Just call it white. Blasian white Blasian

58
00:04:07.160 --> 00:04:09.600
and the giants were like, did you eat white Blasian today?

59
00:04:09.601 --> 00:04:11.640
It's it's the day where we

60
00:04:13.650 --> 00:04:18.060
it's the day where we conquered all. Anyway, dude,

61
00:04:19.020 --> 00:04:22.470
uh, what was I talking about? Parking? I mean, you know, so,

62
00:04:22.471 --> 00:04:25.920
and then they're like, yeah, park here. I get so heated dude in my car

63
00:04:27.630 --> 00:04:32.100
and it's and how to make it look with this YouTube video,

64
00:04:32.101 --> 00:04:34.020
that one fighter pulled up how to make her duck.

65
00:04:34.021 --> 00:04:38.520
And here's how you make her duck and you down. He had don't.

66
00:04:38.550 --> 00:04:40.560
I want to make a video that's on YouTube.

67
00:04:40.561 --> 00:04:43.860
That's how to make her duck in and you click on it and it's just,

68
00:04:44.010 --> 00:04:47.040
and it's just me and I go like this, he don't.

69
00:04:50.530 --> 00:04:51.363
<v 1>Um.</v>

70
00:04:51.960 --> 00:04:56.580
<v 0>So, uh, I do that and then, and then, so, and then in the coffee shop,</v>

71
00:04:56.581 --> 00:05:00.330
it's the worst dude, because, so this, like, I go like this, well,

72
00:05:00.331 --> 00:05:03.150
I'm going to coffee and they go like this. Okay. They know too,

73
00:05:03.151 --> 00:05:06.900
they know what are you doing here, guy, on the other hand,

74
00:05:06.901 --> 00:05:09.770
it's nice that they just have a job. You know, it's hard to get a job out there.

75
00:05:09.790 --> 00:05:12.630
So part of me is like, at least as companies paying them, you know

76
00:05:14.640 --> 00:05:17.940
what company is doing? This is what I want to know. Anyway. And then,

77
00:05:19.170 --> 00:05:22.620
and this valet one, this, this, I don't know if this drives me more nuts.

78
00:05:22.920 --> 00:05:24.630
I do it less go to three art.

79
00:05:24.670 --> 00:05:28.680
So I get to the thing and it's always one of the two or three of the guys.

80
00:05:28.681 --> 00:05:32.430
And he's like, they're always like, they're always like, when they're like,

81
00:05:32.550 --> 00:05:35.700
how long are you going to be? And I'm just like, what the does it matter?

82
00:05:35.701 --> 00:05:39.930
I got to take a ticket anyway, what am I,

83
00:05:39.931 --> 00:05:43.140
your girlfriend? We just talking and. Hey, are we in bed?

84
00:05:43.800 --> 00:05:47.610
So I say an hour and the guy goes like this. Okay.

85
00:05:48.630 --> 00:05:50.150
Or I want us to park there. And I,

86
00:05:50.151 --> 00:05:54.060
and I parked there and I park where he says,

87
00:05:54.330 --> 00:05:56.850
because it's more official. It's not like a cafe. I'm like, all right,

88
00:05:56.880 --> 00:05:59.540
maybe knows his. Every time I parked there.

89
00:05:59.930 --> 00:06:03.170
And it's always a spot that's like free and clear, I'm not blocking a car.

90
00:06:03.200 --> 00:06:07.010
And he says, well, can you leave your key with me? Which drives me nuts.

91
00:06:07.011 --> 00:06:09.950
If I'm free and clear, why do I need to leave a key?

92
00:06:11.810 --> 00:06:15.590
Why do I need to leave a key? If I'm free and clear, there is zero reason.

93
00:06:15.770 --> 00:06:20.690
You need to leave your key with somebody. If your car is free and clear.

94
00:06:20.930 --> 00:06:24.680
Okay. So I give it to them. Cause I'm like, all right, well, what's the point.

95
00:06:24.681 --> 00:06:28.940
If I'm like, why was he going to steal my, my, uh, my,

96
00:06:28.980 --> 00:06:33.190
my ibuprofen and my, and my. I don't keep in my car. So

97
00:06:34.690 --> 00:06:39.130
I leave and I come back and the car is always in a different

98
00:06:39.131 --> 00:06:43.570
space, dude. Do you know how annoying that?

99
00:06:47.500 --> 00:06:51.370
It's, it's, it's pretty annoying.

100
00:06:52.810 --> 00:06:57.340
Get back down. And it's pretty annoying, dude, that I show up.

101
00:06:57.670 --> 00:07:02.200
And my car's just in a different place, dude,

102
00:07:02.380 --> 00:07:04.540
for zero reason,

103
00:07:04.810 --> 00:07:09.520
he just moves my car to another area for

104
00:07:09.521 --> 00:07:11.380
zero reason. Dude,

105
00:07:13.030 --> 00:07:17.350
other cars are just in all sorts. And then I got to go back. Oh, here you go.

106
00:07:17.351 --> 00:07:20.440
Here's your key. All thanks, dude. Thanks for this night. Yeah,

107
00:07:24.940 --> 00:07:27.400

Young Hove. He's making young, he's making to duck in, in a parking lot.

110
00:07:40.540 --> 00:07:45.460
