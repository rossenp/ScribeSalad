WEBVTT

1
00:00:00.570 --> 00:00:04.410
<v 0>I shot my special. Let me start with this dude. I shot my special,</v>

2
00:00:06.060 --> 00:00:09.510
uh, Saturday now I don't know what I'm going to call it,

3
00:00:10.920 --> 00:00:15.240
but I don't think I've ever had a better

4
00:00:16.230 --> 00:00:21.000
taping. You know, just the, the, the comedy,

5
00:00:21.690 --> 00:00:26.430
all the comedy that could go wrong. It just kind of aligned. I was relaxed.

6
00:00:26.431 --> 00:00:30.630
The first show I went on, my brother directed it, but first show I went on.

7
00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:34.440
It was good, really good. I got off stage. And my, my agent was like,

8
00:00:34.441 --> 00:00:38.430
that's the best, first show taping I've ever seen? And I was like, really?

9
00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:40.590
And he was like, yup. And then I was like,

10
00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:45.720
and then I was like, cool. So we got to only need pieces.

11
00:00:45.721 --> 00:00:47.820
And when he needs pieces, he needs pieces. That's all they need.

12
00:00:47.821 --> 00:00:49.500
So he's relaxed, dude.

13
00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:51.990
<v 1>So your boy's relaxed now.</v>

14
00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:56.250
<v 0>You know, the whole mantra of life rips, you realize, you know what,</v>

15
00:00:56.251 --> 00:00:59.400
this is one of those moments where life does actually rep.

16
00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:02.670
So the boy needs pieces and he's going on stage for the second show.

17
00:01:02.671 --> 00:01:04.800
And he's seen his head. He's like, Oh, I only need pieces.

18
00:01:05.160 --> 00:01:08.760
And then he gets on stage. And as soon as he gets on stage, dude,

19
00:01:08.940 --> 00:01:13.620
he realizes he only needs like two pieces. And that's when he just ripped.

20
00:01:13.621 --> 00:01:18.360
And that's when the repped and in the middle of the second show, I thought, Hey,

21
00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:20.400
you know what? I tapped,

22
00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:25.620
I tapped God on the shoulder and I go, Hey God, guess what?

23
00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:27.630
We don't even need that first show.

24
00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:30.443
<v 1>So.</v>

25
00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:35.250
<v 0>That second one was the reprimand. That first show was ripping,</v>

26
00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:37.020
but that second show was the ripper.

27
00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:41.370
So that was just an,

28
00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:46.170
I got off stage and I go, Hey, we don't need that first show. Like I was,

29
00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:49.650
the first show was great,

30
00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:54.210
but the second show made us not need the first

31
00:01:54.211 --> 00:01:55.050
show.

32
00:01:58.790 --> 00:01:59.623
<v 1>[Inaudible].</v>

33
00:01:59.690 --> 00:02:04.430
<v 0>Um, so yeah, it was awesome, dude. It was, it was so awesome. So happy.</v>

34
00:02:04.431 --> 00:02:08.150
I was so happy man had some loved ones.

35
00:02:08.151 --> 00:02:13.070
There was just happy, man. My brother killed it.

36
00:02:14.990 --> 00:02:19.370
Um, and that's it.

37
00:02:20.300 --> 00:02:23.660
I couldn't ask for more so I can't wait for you guys to see it. It looks cool.

38
00:02:24.050 --> 00:02:26.630
I had the Jordan, the purple retro ones on

39
00:02:28.610 --> 00:02:30.830
to help me pivot. Um,

40
00:02:32.210 --> 00:02:37.010
and let's see, uh, I don't know what else to say about it,

41
00:02:37.011 --> 00:02:41.480
but I woke up. That was the thing I kept on. Like I, as the days went on too,

42
00:02:41.481 --> 00:02:42.980
I was like, I just, I hope I don't get sick.

43
00:02:43.010 --> 00:02:44.450
That's the only thing that would this up.

44
00:02:44.480 --> 00:02:49.340
I've worked so hard to get this going to get the, um, uh,

45
00:02:49.490 --> 00:02:53.720
material sharpest. I did a 10, 11 day run before the show.

46
00:02:54.170 --> 00:02:58.610
I did some casinos coupled with some theaters and I was like,

47
00:02:58.640 --> 00:03:01.660
don't get sick. Don't get chapped lips, dude. Sure enough.

48
00:03:01.840 --> 00:03:04.060
The second I got off stage on that second show,

49
00:03:04.120 --> 00:03:07.300
my lips go like this and just cracked now.

50
00:03:07.301 --> 00:03:11.650
That's that's Jesus Christ working with you. That's Jesus Christ.

51
00:03:11.890 --> 00:03:16.810
Just kinda, it just kind handed you a couple of of a sword of his,

52
00:03:16.811 --> 00:03:18.940
some assorted nuts. That's what he's doing.

53
00:03:19.180 --> 00:03:22.330
Jesus Christ is just handing you some sword, assorted nuts.

54
00:03:22.510 --> 00:03:26.650
Now can I say a sorted nuts or can I only say a sword nuts?

55
00:03:26.920 --> 00:03:30.550
And now that me off that it sounds like when I'm saying assorted nuts,

56
00:03:30.580 --> 00:03:35.530
it sounds like I'm saying a sword and nuts. Okay.

57
00:03:35.770 --> 00:03:37.630
But I mean, assorted nuts. So that's like,

58
00:03:37.631 --> 00:03:39.460
when you're just kind of hungry walking through the airport,

59
00:03:39.461 --> 00:03:42.940
you don't know what to get and Jesus Christ just walks up to you and hands you

60
00:03:42.941 --> 00:03:46.540
some assorted nuts. Right? So that's what that was.

61
00:03:47.050 --> 00:03:48.910
That was Jesus Christ. Just kind of working with you,

62
00:03:49.300 --> 00:03:51.100
like you're in a cubicle and you're typing it.

63
00:03:51.190 --> 00:03:54.670
Maybe you're in a cubicle right now and you're like, I need that. Hey Susan,

64
00:03:54.671 --> 00:03:55.390
can you hear me? The?

65
00:03:55.390 --> 00:03:58.990
And Susan just reaches over the top of the divider and hinges the that's what's

66
00:03:58.991 --> 00:03:59.830
happening right now.

67
00:04:00.400 --> 00:04:04.060
That's Jesus Christ handing you some assorted nuts.

68
00:04:05.740 --> 00:04:09.280
So it was, I got off the second stage Melissa goes and I go, doesn't matter,

69
00:04:09.281 --> 00:04:12.280
does it? No. Cause when my lip cracks, we know babies,

70
00:04:12.281 --> 00:04:14.260
my lip cracks where it always cracks. And it's going to,

71
00:04:14.261 --> 00:04:17.950
you're going to see that on that high-def camera. Uh,

72
00:04:17.980 --> 00:04:22.150
so I woke up feeling good that day and I was ready. I flew from,

73
00:04:23.020 --> 00:04:26.890
well, I guess it took the Chicago airport to, uh, because I was in new Buffalo,

74
00:04:26.920 --> 00:04:30.100
Michigan for some reason. And I went to the, we, we drove to Chicago

75
00:04:32.170 --> 00:04:36.400
and we went to the dude. I got, I took my,

76
00:04:36.490 --> 00:04:39.640
my tour manager was with us. Cause we were doing like at a 10, 11 day run, Zack,

77
00:04:39.641 --> 00:04:43.840
Don Coveo. And um, that's how he laughs. If you don't remember.

78
00:04:44.440 --> 00:04:48.820
And the guy is just the worst tour manager of all time, dude, straight up.

79
00:04:48.970 --> 00:04:53.860
He's always the last one for, to the bus, to the sprinter van, to the airport.

80
00:04:54.130 --> 00:04:56.860
He's like, we're like, I'm like where the is Zack? And Mike said, I don't know,

81
00:04:56.861 --> 00:04:59.770
man. And then he shows up with like, just,

82
00:04:59.771 --> 00:05:01.360
he always looks like he's carrying seven bags,

83
00:05:01.361 --> 00:05:05.880
even though he's only carrying like two bags and he's just like, Oh yeah. Oh,

84
00:05:07.320 --> 00:05:12.000
I forgot my ID. He's like one of those that doesn't keep the ID and the wallet,

85
00:05:12.450 --> 00:05:16.230
you know, those guys keep your ID in your wallet. Don't have your ID.

86
00:05:16.470 --> 00:05:21.120
Don't be the guy who comes out and brings your ID. The, and some cash, you know,

87
00:05:21.121 --> 00:05:25.290
I'm talking about and he'll be like, Oh, I'm a wallet. We're in a casino.

88
00:05:25.291 --> 00:05:28.230
We're staying in a casino. We were staying at the MGM grand and in Detroit.

89
00:05:28.410 --> 00:05:30.690
And I'll be like, let's go get a coffee. And it's in the casino.

90
00:05:30.691 --> 00:05:35.040
And he'll be like, all right, let's go. And then I'll go down the elevator.

91
00:05:35.160 --> 00:05:38.730
And then we get to the thing, Oh, you know what? I forgot my ID.

92
00:05:39.540 --> 00:05:44.340
I'm 37. She's like, sweetheart, I need the ID. And I'm like, well,

93
00:05:44.341 --> 00:05:47.610
I have it, man. You should always have it ID on you man. And he was like, well,

94
00:05:47.611 --> 00:05:49.440
I don't know it was in the bag because I had to,

95
00:05:49.710 --> 00:05:54.360
because it was my money and I don't know. Hey. And so I I'm like,

96
00:05:54.361 --> 00:05:57.650
I'm not waiting for you, bro, bro. I'm going to leave him at the hotel one day.

97
00:05:57.980 --> 00:05:59.480
I'm gonna leave him at the hotel. See the thing is,

98
00:05:59.630 --> 00:06:02.300
he's got some of my bags sometimes. So that's, what's it.

99
00:06:02.330 --> 00:06:04.940
I'm going to take all my bags one night and then we get to the sprinter van.

100
00:06:05.330 --> 00:06:06.890
Zack's not going to be there. I'm going to say, Hey Mike, where's Zach.

101
00:06:06.891 --> 00:06:07.820
He's gonna be like, I don't know, man.

102
00:06:07.821 --> 00:06:12.100
He was shuffling around in the hotel room doing some. Oh,

103
00:06:12.400 --> 00:06:16.660
he takes so long, bro. We could be in a green room and I'll be like,

104
00:06:16.661 --> 00:06:19.870
let's go downstairs to see where the is. And we'll be like, okay.

105
00:06:19.990 --> 00:06:21.430
And I'll walk down the hallway and I'll look,

106
00:06:21.460 --> 00:06:24.340
I'll do the thing where I look behind to the green room and he's still not out

107
00:06:24.341 --> 00:06:25.960
yet. Do you know what I'm talking about?

108
00:06:26.080 --> 00:06:28.360
You get out of the green room and then you walk out.

109
00:06:28.570 --> 00:06:31.060
It's like when you leave a room and you're waiting for somebody and you walk

110
00:06:31.061 --> 00:06:31.661
down the hallway,

111
00:06:31.661 --> 00:06:35.320
but you're still looking at the room's door and he's still not there.

112
00:06:35.321 --> 00:06:38.800
And you're all the way down the hallway. Hey man. Get with it. Dude.

113
00:06:38.860 --> 00:06:42.520
Always know where your ideas to do. You know why it's your ID?

114
00:06:42.610 --> 00:06:47.560
If there's one thing you should always have on you besides pants

115
00:06:47.860 --> 00:06:49.150
have your ID on you.

116
00:06:52.510 --> 00:06:53.650
My podcast is musical.

117
00:06:56.710 --> 00:06:58.900
My podcast is musical. That's probably why I don't like music.

118
00:06:58.901 --> 00:07:02.110
All that much dude. But you saw your boy when he used the mic. When he was like,

119
00:07:02.170 --> 00:07:06.310
Hey ants, who other, what other podcasts host is doing that.

120
00:07:06.730 --> 00:07:11.140
That's because we're down for a syllabus time and that's it. And life rips. Now,

121
00:07:11.170 --> 00:07:13.420
dude, I've been seeing people on Instagram, start podcasts,

122
00:07:13.600 --> 00:07:14.950
talking about silly goose times,

123
00:07:15.040 --> 00:07:19.060
talking about how life's reps talking about using my cadence. And that's fine,

124
00:07:19.061 --> 00:07:23.110
dude, because people know where you got it from and it's all gravy.

125
00:07:24.070 --> 00:07:27.700
Okay. But just so you know, we all know and that's fine. Rep the call, do it.

126
00:07:27.701 --> 00:07:31.960
Whatever. Sometimes people use it and they are disgusting with it.

127
00:07:31.961 --> 00:07:34.750
Sometimes people use the way I talk and they start talking about Blumkins or

128
00:07:34.751 --> 00:07:36.070
something. No, we don't do that, dude.

129
00:07:36.550 --> 00:07:40.540
We don't talk about the Lumpkins here at the log cabin. I'm a classy guy.

130
00:07:42.070 --> 00:07:46.780
I'm a classic man. What's that song? [inaudible]

131
00:07:46.840 --> 00:07:51.250
I'm a classic man. Anyway, dude,

132
00:07:51.520 --> 00:07:55.180
we don't talk about Blumkins man. We don't talk about gross. You know,

133
00:07:55.480 --> 00:07:58.690
maybe I might mention, you should take some Metamucil if you're trying to,

134
00:07:58.780 --> 00:08:01.480
you know, take some nice bowel movements, but I don't talk about Blumkins.

135
00:08:01.810 --> 00:08:06.430
I don't talk about Lena pluses that much. And I don't,

136
00:08:06.600 --> 00:08:08.950
I don't, I would never say something like Grundle. You know what I mean?

137
00:08:09.100 --> 00:08:13.090
Like I'm not a frat guy. How many? The guy who goes like this,

138
00:08:13.120 --> 00:08:16.210
the guy who talks about a Grundle is a guy who goes like this when something's

139
00:08:16.211 --> 00:08:18.370
funny, the whole man that's classic.

140
00:08:19.000 --> 00:08:22.810
That guy says Grundle so much and I don't do that. You know how I go, man?

141
00:08:23.140 --> 00:08:27.820
You know how I go all I want, you know what I realized, man,

142
00:08:28.630 --> 00:08:33.010
I was coming up in the comedy world, like whatever, my, my, my brother and I,

143
00:08:33.011 --> 00:08:35.890
we have this way of talking and it, it, it, you know, my friends,

144
00:08:35.891 --> 00:08:38.170
we all have it. And I was like, ah, I want to do,

145
00:08:38.171 --> 00:08:42.400
I w I wish the world knew my language now, baby.

146
00:08:42.401 --> 00:08:47.020
I made the podcast. Now the world knows my language. Okay. I did it.

147
00:08:47.050 --> 00:08:50.590
I didn't know I could do it, but it did it. If you build it, they will come.

148
00:08:51.430 --> 00:08:54.910
But I woke up feeling so good. I woke up feeling so good. Three days,

149
00:08:55.170 --> 00:08:55.740
my special,

150
00:08:55.740 --> 00:08:59.310
I woke up feeling two days before my special and the day of my special,

151
00:08:59.400 --> 00:09:02.490
I woke up feeling good. Now I got a question for you, scientists.

152
00:09:02.820 --> 00:09:06.300
Why does that happen? How come sometimes you get lots of sleep. You feel good.

153
00:09:06.301 --> 00:09:08.760
Sometimes you get lots of sleep. You feel bad. Sometimes you get a little sleep.

154
00:09:08.820 --> 00:09:11.790
You feel good. Sometimes you get a little sleep, you feel bad. What's the deal.

155
00:09:12.360 --> 00:09:16.560
Why do I sleep better in hotel beds than I do in my own bed? What's the deal?

156
00:09:16.620 --> 00:09:20.970
Do I need a new mattress? Maybe, but mattresses are thousands of dollars.

157
00:09:22.410 --> 00:09:27.090
So that's a little bit weird for a test of something to be a thousand, $2,000.

158
00:09:27.120 --> 00:09:29.280
How much is a mattress on? And I'm so out of touch. I don't give a.

159
00:09:29.730 --> 00:09:31.350
How much is a carton of milk? $45.

160
00:09:33.080 --> 00:09:33.913
<v 2>[Inaudible].</v>

161
00:09:37.610 --> 00:09:41.300
<v 0>Um, I'll cough on your do, but yeah, it's uh,</v>

162
00:09:43.370 --> 00:09:44.203
um.

163
00:09:45.980 --> 00:09:46.400
<v 2>You.</v>

164
00:09:46.400 --> 00:09:47.750
<v 0>Know, it's, it is what it is, man,</v>

165
00:09:47.751 --> 00:09:50.360
but I had a good special taping and it was awesome.

166
00:09:50.510 --> 00:09:51.830
And I woke up feeling so good.

167
00:09:52.880 --> 00:09:57.350
And my buddy Mike went on before me and he was like, don't, we'll do the word,

168
00:09:57.860 --> 00:10:01.700
no woos on my last special, there were wounds, bro.

169
00:10:01.730 --> 00:10:04.830
I hate when people go, woo.

170
00:10:05.750 --> 00:10:09.680
You're not at the nets game. Why are you going? Woo.

171
00:10:09.740 --> 00:10:12.320
Dicamba [inaudible] is an onstage.

172
00:10:15.230 --> 00:10:19.630
And um, yeah, dude, Hey, why are you going?

173
00:10:20.240 --> 00:10:23.150
Whoa, Jay Buner isn't out on this field.

174
00:10:25.340 --> 00:10:30.320
And so, yeah, it really me off when they go, Whoa. And they were,

175
00:10:30.321 --> 00:10:33.320
there was no woos there. I think there was one, we were on the second show.

176
00:10:33.380 --> 00:10:36.500
Somebody got kicked, thrown out. Apparently imagine being that big of an,

177
00:10:36.710 --> 00:10:39.100
he was talking loud, I'm a manager, walked out to him. He was there.

178
00:10:39.200 --> 00:10:41.360
He was like, I ended it on someone else. And there was my out, you know,

179
00:10:41.690 --> 00:10:44.210
and the guy was like, he was, I was like, what happened? He was like,

180
00:10:44.400 --> 00:10:48.500
he was just being loud. Okay. And he got up Linda, the bathroom dude.

181
00:10:48.501 --> 00:10:50.570
I didn't come back. He was like, where's my seat.

182
00:10:50.600 --> 00:10:54.800
We put somebody else they're being really loud on. Right. So, you know,

183
00:10:55.640 --> 00:10:59.300
out. And he was like, well, can I just go back to get my stuff? And I was like,

184
00:10:59.301 --> 00:11:04.190
sure, what your stab is, hold on. You know? And he's like, where is it?

185
00:11:04.191 --> 00:11:06.560
And he's like, well, look, I don't know. I've got a wallet, my money,

186
00:11:06.561 --> 00:11:10.070
my ID in there, you know? And I got it. Anyway,

187
00:11:10.370 --> 00:11:15.050
we found out he he's being loud. And I was like, Oh yeah, that's carry mom. So,

188
00:11:15.530 --> 00:11:19.190
and uh, I don't, if it's gonna work out on, you know,

189
00:11:19.270 --> 00:11:21.710
I knew it and it sounds like it's gonna be fine. Okay. But,

190
00:11:24.260 --> 00:11:29.090
and uh, and so he threw him out, dude, he's a bulldog man. My manager's good.

191
00:11:29.570 --> 00:11:34.190
Josh Lieberman. And um, so anyway, tossed him out. It was all good.

192
00:11:34.191 --> 00:11:35.780
Didn't really hear it. He kind of. He said,

193
00:11:35.810 --> 00:11:37.520
I think I heard something in the first show. I think it might,

194
00:11:37.521 --> 00:11:39.080
might've heard him get a little loud at the first show,

195
00:11:39.081 --> 00:11:41.630
but how could you be that ego? I get not egotistical,

196
00:11:41.631 --> 00:11:46.340
but self-centered to be like making a scene at the Netflix special

197
00:11:46.341 --> 00:11:47.174
taping.

198
00:11:47.720 --> 00:11:49.850
<v 2>Anyway. Um.</v>

199
00:11:50.870 --> 00:11:53.420
<v 0>Yeah. So laughing, don't laugh. Like I always say.</v>
