00:00:00.480 --> 00:00:04.590
<v 0>In 49 minutes. Jesus Christ. What I do that for the next 11 minutes? Uh.</v>

2
00:00:10.790 --> 00:00:11.623
<v 1>It is what it is.</v>

3
00:00:12.770 --> 00:00:15.910
<v 0>Um, Oh, I have to, you know, what I have to do is, Oh, I got to tell you,</v>

4
00:00:15.920 --> 00:00:20.810
remember, I told you that story last week about my dad and about the nude ma the

5
00:00:21.170 --> 00:00:22.550
nude clippings that I had,

6
00:00:24.050 --> 00:00:26.660
he heard it and he told me you forgot some parts.

7
00:00:26.661 --> 00:00:28.190
And so I should fill in the parts.

8
00:00:28.880 --> 00:00:33.530
So I here is the updated version from my dad.

9
00:00:34.910 --> 00:00:38.900
My dad already kind of had an inkling about it because my buddy Matra Vinny

10
00:00:38.930 --> 00:00:43.730
called me a few days before that and said, Hey, Mr. Dalea is Chris there?

11
00:00:43.790 --> 00:00:44.720
And I picked it up.

12
00:00:44.721 --> 00:00:48.560
And when I picked it up before my dad hung up the phone Matra van and said,

13
00:00:48.561 --> 00:00:51.650
you want to go see the pictures? And my dad hung up the phone and was like,

14
00:00:51.651 --> 00:00:55.490
I wonder what thought about. Right? So

15
00:00:57.350 --> 00:00:58.183
the,

16
00:00:58.850 --> 00:01:03.410
the kid came over and told on me and my dad said so.

17
00:01:04.070 --> 00:01:08.570
And he said, yes. So I just don't know. I wanted to tell you.

18
00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:12.740
And my dad said, yeah, so now I know now what?

19
00:01:13.460 --> 00:01:14.990
And the kid said, well, I don't know.

20
00:01:16.190 --> 00:01:20.600
And that was good because my dad is a boss player. Now, afterwards,

21
00:01:21.350 --> 00:01:22.070
my dad,

22
00:01:22.070 --> 00:01:24.530
cause he went to see the picture and make sure there was no animal or anything

23
00:01:25.440 --> 00:01:30.200
said, well, look, if you really want to see, uh,

24
00:01:31.250 --> 00:01:35.990
see, uh, a beautiful naked woman look at this.

25
00:01:36.500 --> 00:01:37.940
And he had, uh, a foot,

26
00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:42.230
his friend was a photographer named Marco Glavine out, eh,

27
00:01:43.400 --> 00:01:44.630
say Italian,

28
00:01:45.230 --> 00:01:47.150
his name was [inaudible]. Okay. Eh, straight up said Italian. So he, um,

29
00:01:47.150 --> 00:01:47.150
 he was like, uh,  he, Oh

30
00:01:47.150 --> 00:01:47.150
, he would photograph naked women like in a beautiful way, black and white with, it all 

31
00:01:47.150 --> 00:01:47.150
look like, you know, film noir. And uh,  he said, look at this

32
00:01:47.150 --> 00:01:47.150
, look at this. And my dad starts opening the pages, showing me these beautiful women nude models and not the girl who I was looking at with fried butterflies and, and big 

33
00:01:47.150 --> 00:01:47.150
melons

34
00:01:47.150 --> 00:01:47.150
. My buddy in high school used to say Jimbo, and I'd be like, what's that? And he'd say, 

35
00:01:47.150 --> 00:01:47.983
[inaudible].

36
00:02:28.640 --> 00:02:30.500
<v 2>Dude. Oh, what a.</v>

37
00:02:31.910 --> 00:02:36.290
<v 0>Goofball. So, um, anyway, uh,</v>

38
00:02:36.350 --> 00:02:38.210
so he shows me these, this book,

39
00:02:38.280 --> 00:02:42.260
this photography book that Mark Laviano did and all these women,

40
00:02:42.290 --> 00:02:45.200
beautiful women. And I look and I'm like the wee baby. And I'm like, Oh,

41
00:02:45.201 --> 00:02:48.260
this is a woman. Right. And my dad and I, my dad said,

42
00:02:48.261 --> 00:02:51.860
I looked at him and I said, I said,

43
00:02:52.160 --> 00:02:53.540
does mom know you have this?

44
00:02:56.780 --> 00:02:59.590
And he was like, yeah, yeah, no.

45
00:02:59.830 --> 00:03:04.810
I thought he was like confiding in me that, Oh. All right,

46
00:03:04.811 --> 00:03:06.250
I'll keep it. Cool. I won't tell mom,

47
00:03:06.251 --> 00:03:11.140
you have this photo book of Marco Gloriana anyway,

48
00:03:11.141 --> 00:03:13.810
dude, I would go in and I would look at that every after,

49
00:03:13.811 --> 00:03:16.660
after that I remember I would go in and I would look at it when my dad wasn't in

50
00:03:16.661 --> 00:03:21.640
his office. And sometimes I show my friends. That's crazy,

51
00:03:21.641 --> 00:03:25.690
man. It's crazy how the you remember, you know?

52
00:03:26.530 --> 00:03:31.330
And it's crazy to think when you have a kid that like my kid

53
00:03:31.420 --> 00:03:33.160
is going to have that, those moments

54
00:03:34.690 --> 00:03:38.530
and he's going to have moments of Oh,

55
00:03:41.290 --> 00:03:43.390
like that, just that you remember,

56
00:03:43.510 --> 00:03:46.570
and some of them are gonna be important to some of them aren't, you know,

57
00:03:47.440 --> 00:03:51.430
like I remember one time I was a preschool pre-K or whatever the

58
00:03:53.140 --> 00:03:57.220
and this girl, I was eating wafers. Those, those, those wafers,

59
00:03:58.090 --> 00:04:01.180
I always would have these vanilla wafers. I loved them do it.

60
00:04:01.900 --> 00:04:03.430
My mom wouldn't get them enough, you know?

61
00:04:04.570 --> 00:04:08.950
And I was eating them and then she was eating her, whatever dessert was,

62
00:04:08.951 --> 00:04:10.300
it was dessert time, you know?

63
00:04:10.930 --> 00:04:15.640
And she was eating the wafers and taking the smallest

64
00:04:15.641 --> 00:04:19.600
bites, the smallest bites. Now we were both small,

65
00:04:19.810 --> 00:04:23.590
but she was taking the smallest bites. And I was like,

66
00:04:24.040 --> 00:04:27.460
looking at her while I was eating the F bro. I shovel in my mouth.

67
00:04:27.490 --> 00:04:30.040
I don't even use my hands sometime. I just go like this. And I'm like,

68
00:04:30.640 --> 00:04:34.420
and then move forward on the table. As I chomp

69
00:04:36.490 --> 00:04:37.323
along, it's like,

70
00:04:37.660 --> 00:04:40.480
it's like a conveyor belt at the end of a horror movie where somebody was like,

71
00:04:40.530 --> 00:04:43.360
no, no, they get smashed in the head anyway. That's my,

72
00:04:43.660 --> 00:04:46.000
that's how the food's getting into my mouth. I don't,

73
00:04:46.570 --> 00:04:51.040
there's always going to be food. People say, why do you eat so fast?

74
00:04:51.130 --> 00:04:53.710
Because I always want the food in my mouth. The second I swallow it,

75
00:04:53.711 --> 00:04:58.630
I put more food in my mouth. Cause the sensation is the best in the mouth.

76
00:04:59.050 --> 00:05:02.530
I don't want to swallow, wait a little bit and just suck on air.

77
00:05:03.820 --> 00:05:08.740
I want to eat the and it tastes good. And yum, yum. It tastes good.

78
00:05:08.950 --> 00:05:10.840
And yum, yum. It tastes good.

79
00:05:10.990 --> 00:05:15.700
And then I swallow it and then I put another piece in my mouth because,

80
00:05:16.810 --> 00:05:20.260
because it's sensation because it's,

81
00:05:23.710 --> 00:05:28.210
and this girl was eating the smallest bites. And in my little head,

82
00:05:28.990 --> 00:05:30.760
I was like, Oh, you know, how old are you when you go to pre-K?

83
00:05:30.761 --> 00:05:34.360
I don't know for, I don't know, younger. I three,

84
00:05:36.400 --> 00:05:38.590
I, uh, I was like,

85
00:05:40.270 --> 00:05:44.860
am I going to say something to this girl? Am I going to at? Cause what,

86
00:05:44.940 --> 00:05:45.820
what is she doing?

87
00:05:46.150 --> 00:05:51.040
She needs to know that she has to have more of the food in her mouth

88
00:05:51.070 --> 00:05:53.290
to hit all the taste buds. And then when she swallow,

89
00:05:53.291 --> 00:05:55.060
she needs to put another mouthful in there.

90
00:05:55.210 --> 00:06:00.170
So it's at maximum fun capacity in our mouth. You understand?

91
00:06:00.590 --> 00:06:04.310
This is the I was breaking down as a three-year-old and she's chomping little

92
00:06:04.640 --> 00:06:08.690
nibble mouse bites. And I look at her and now I can't help myself.

93
00:06:09.170 --> 00:06:11.360
Cause I'm like, I gotta say something. Cause I gotta know what the she's doing.

94
00:06:11.361 --> 00:06:14.510
I gotta know why she's doing it because I am I going to teach her how to eat?

95
00:06:14.511 --> 00:06:19.160
Like, what's the deal. She was younger than me too. I remember. And I say, Hey.

96
00:06:19.670 --> 00:06:22.010
And she says, yeah, I bet she was so cute.

97
00:06:22.040 --> 00:06:25.010
Even as a three-year-old she was maybe two. And I was like, Oh, she's so cute.

98
00:06:26.840 --> 00:06:30.500
But she was, I was like, why taking such small bites?

99
00:06:31.850 --> 00:06:36.320
And she looked at me and she says, because then it lasts longer.

100
00:06:38.210 --> 00:06:43.010
And I couldn't really argue with that. You know,

101
00:06:44.120 --> 00:06:47.180
she taught me and I thought I was going to teach.

102
00:06:48.080 --> 00:06:48.913
<v 3>Her.</v>

103
00:06:49.910 --> 00:06:52.370
<v 0>So the moral of the story is a two year old can teach a three-year-old</v>

104
00:06:52.371 --> 00:06:57.140
something, but I still take monster bites,

105
00:06:57.141 --> 00:07:01.520
dude. I've never taken a small bite. But my point is,

106
00:07:01.910 --> 00:07:06.800
I think of that all the time.

107
00:07:07.700 --> 00:07:12.500
I think of it all the time. I don't know who that girl is.

108
00:07:13.190 --> 00:07:17.450
I don't remember her name. I think she was Mexican or something.

109
00:07:18.500 --> 00:07:21.530
Maybe Puerto Rican because we were on the East coast. But dude,

110
00:07:21.920 --> 00:07:23.210
I think about it all the time.

111
00:07:24.200 --> 00:07:27.260
I think about it often when I'm eating while I'm taking my big bites,

112
00:07:27.650 --> 00:07:30.200
you never know what's going to shape you. It could be the Nudie magazines.

113
00:07:30.230 --> 00:07:32.540
It could be the small bites to the girl sitting next to you,

114
00:07:32.930 --> 00:07:35.600
but that's what makes you who you are. And that's beautiful, dude.

115
00:07:35.930 --> 00:07:38.660
That's beautiful. Uh,

116
00:07:42.130 --> 00:07:44.440
yeah, I remember what she said that too. I thought, Oh,

117
00:07:44.441 --> 00:07:47.830
I'd rather it go quick and just get the maximum phone capacity in my mouth.

118
00:07:50.020 --> 00:07:50.853
Uh, because of.

119
00:07:50.980 --> 00:07:53.290
<v 3>Sensation, sensation, sensation.</v>

120
00:07:59.050 --> 00:08:01.810
<v 0>Um, being a kid was the man</v>

121
00:08:03.490 --> 00:08:04.323
being a kid was the.

122
00:08:07.180 --> 00:08:09.670
I guess you'd get to relive those moments. You know, when you have a kid,

123
00:08:09.850 --> 00:08:14.440
I hope so. That would be very cool. Very nice and very special.
