00:00:01.020 --> 00:00:05.880
<v 0>Dude, the world is nuts. Like people thought like when Bieber challenged,</v>

2
00:00:05.881 --> 00:00:09.720
Tom cruise to the fight, like everyone was like, Oh, what the?

3
00:00:10.650 --> 00:00:14.670
And then people was like, yo, I'm joking. And everyone, I mean, no.

4
00:00:15.090 --> 00:00:19.800
He's joking, man. No. He's joking.

5
00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:24.540
Bieber's like, yeah. Yeah. You're, you, you,

6
00:00:24.990 --> 00:00:28.470
you want to fight or you're scared. You think talk.

7
00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:30.510
You think Tom cruise would have beat up Justin Bieber?

8
00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:33.360
I think just to be able to beat the out of him, people are like, yeah,

9
00:00:33.361 --> 00:00:34.260
you don't with Tom cruise.

10
00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:35.940
Or he does all his own stunts and he's always running.

11
00:00:36.240 --> 00:00:39.300
I think beer will beat the out of Tom cruise.

12
00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:44.850
And dude Bieber would have beat the out of Tom

13
00:00:44.851 --> 00:00:48.240
cruise for real he's 20 zero.

14
00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:51.450
And Tom cruise is 50 whatever.

15
00:00:53.130 --> 00:00:55.710
And Tom cruise, uh,

16
00:00:56.130 --> 00:00:59.430
would've would've would have sincerely lost and they would have interviewed

17
00:00:59.520 --> 00:00:59.720
them.

18
00:00:59.720 --> 00:01:02.600
<v 1>So the fight in there, depending on people who,</v>

19
00:01:03.290 --> 00:01:06.380
when he would have been like publicly say, we have a responsibility,

20
00:01:06.381 --> 00:01:09.980
it's not just the warnings. It's not just David Miscavige. You know,

21
00:01:09.981 --> 00:01:11.900
it's not just not just me. It's.

22
00:01:12.770 --> 00:01:15.110
<v 0>That 75 times. Since the last time we talked about it,</v>

23
00:01:15.980 --> 00:01:19.460
my favorite is when he's like this, my favorite,

24
00:01:19.490 --> 00:01:22.460
this is my favorite is when he goes like this and the end of it,

25
00:01:22.550 --> 00:01:25.610
they get this clip of him just going like this. And he's just like,

26
00:01:25.820 --> 00:01:29.870
and he does this. He does like what a straight up guy.

27
00:01:29.930 --> 00:01:34.280
Who's just knows he's killing at life. And he's just like,

28
00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:39.500
and he's got his one ring finger in his mouth and his other pinkie is just,

29
00:01:39.530 --> 00:01:43.490
and he's just, and his two hands are up on the temple. Do it.

30
00:01:43.491 --> 00:01:47.720
If you're doing that, you're this dude. He was gone. He goes like this.

31
00:01:50.510 --> 00:01:53.570
Imagine doing that. That's some, dude,

32
00:01:53.571 --> 00:01:58.340
if you put your two fingers up to your temple and your one finger in your mouth,

33
00:01:58.730 --> 00:02:00.980
imagine this because some of you guys are just listening to this.

34
00:02:01.460 --> 00:02:04.460
And then your little pinky is just dangling. Dude,

35
00:02:04.490 --> 00:02:08.660
you got your two fingers on your temple. Imagine this one,

36
00:02:08.690 --> 00:02:11.450
your ring finger on touching your bottom teeth.

37
00:02:11.840 --> 00:02:16.220
And then your pinky is just dangling. Dude.

38
00:02:17.930 --> 00:02:22.430
You cannot be more confident than that. You simply can't.

39
00:02:25.070 --> 00:02:28.850
That part is so ill. There it is.

40
00:02:30.440 --> 00:02:31.340
It's so ill.

41
00:02:31.341 --> 00:02:35.750
I got to get to that point where you're just laughing about

42
00:02:35.751 --> 00:02:37.720
life. That's what I love about Tom cruise,

43
00:02:37.740 --> 00:02:39.920
that he laughed so much because his life is the.

44
00:02:42.260 --> 00:02:43.093
His life is the.

45
00:02:45.890 --> 00:02:47.430
<v 1>There's nothing part of the way</v>

46
00:02:52.970 --> 00:02:56.810
or depending on us. There's nothing part of the way for me.

47
00:02:57.080 --> 00:03:01.810
Cause I'm just joking about that. And it does make me feel that

48
00:03:05.590 --> 00:03:09.130
we got more work. I need more help. I get those spectators.

49
00:03:09.820 --> 00:03:12.790
You're in the playing field out of the arena. You know,

50
00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:16.270
this is the guy I want to be. I understand. That's how I feel about it.

51
00:03:17.050 --> 00:03:17.883
I do what I can do.

52
00:03:17.940 --> 00:03:21.210
<v 0>Tom cruise is saying for real it, this is his version of,</v>

53
00:03:21.240 --> 00:03:22.740
I want my chips with the dip.

54
00:03:24.480 --> 00:03:28.080
<v 1>I do it the way I do everything he does.</v>

55
00:03:29.880 --> 00:03:32.310
So not funny, but kill him part of the way

56
00:03:37.320 --> 00:03:38.130
I do it. The way I do it.

57
00:03:38.130 --> 00:03:40.080
<v 0>Everything, there's nothing part of the way for me. I just,</v>

58
00:03:40.860 --> 00:03:45.840
and just die in dude, that you don't understand.

59
00:03:46.020 --> 00:03:47.490
You don't understand. Dude.

60
00:03:47.670 --> 00:03:52.590
People think that like Drake and like these famous people and

61
00:03:52.591 --> 00:03:57.360
T Tom cruise, they just there that's. My goal

62
00:03:58.890 --> 00:04:03.180
is to get there, dude is to get to the point where I'm just,

63
00:04:03.450 --> 00:04:06.720
and by the way, I'm not that famous, but I'm almost there.

64
00:04:06.780 --> 00:04:09.930
I'm the regular guy almost there. That's just like,

65
00:04:10.290 --> 00:04:14.880
I'm on my chips with the DEP dude. I want to go to meetings and being like,

66
00:04:14.910 --> 00:04:17.310
well, you know, I want my chips with the dirt

67
00:04:18.930 --> 00:04:22.410
and just laughing like a dude of his.

68
00:04:22.650 --> 00:04:27.120
That's not funny, but I don't give a because I'm killing it.

69
00:04:27.990 --> 00:04:31.890
That's that's how you, that's how we all have to get. Dude.

70
00:04:32.370 --> 00:04:36.990
If we aren't all there, then life is just going to crumble. Dude,

71
00:04:37.050 --> 00:04:38.880
we're going to build these bombs. We're going to build these,

72
00:04:39.690 --> 00:04:42.600
the cities are going to get too big people going to hate each other dude.

73
00:04:42.630 --> 00:04:45.660
That's the goal to get there, dude,

74
00:04:47.790 --> 00:04:52.020
to get there. I talk about this. This is a theme on this,

75
00:04:52.290 --> 00:04:56.220
on this, on this, uh, on this podcast,

76
00:04:58.560 --> 00:05:00.000
but it's the goal, dude.
