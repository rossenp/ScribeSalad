1
00:00:01.170 --> 00:00:05.940
<v 0>Uh, nice. Right. We're doing it. We're doing it. Nice.</v>

2
00:00:07.230 --> 00:00:11.880
Um, okay, so we're doing it. Nice means absolutely nothing. Uh,

3
00:00:13.110 --> 00:00:17.250
people are nuts about this thing though. Going on how crazy it is.

4
00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:22.350
I went to go get a coffee. And by that, I mean, I was out taking a drive,

5
00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:26.850
not losing my mind, you know, just keeping it nice. So my brain doesn't go.

6
00:00:27.150 --> 00:00:31.410
And all of a sudden I start believing in pizza gate. But what I did was

7
00:00:33.150 --> 00:00:37.230
I stopped in a coffee bean and tea leaf. Now, you know, you know,

8
00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:41.970
if you listened to this podcast from jump that your boy ran that block back in

9
00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:44.220
Sherman Oaks.

10
00:00:44.220 --> 00:00:47.220
And I don't like to talk about it that much anymore because it brings a tear to

11
00:00:47.221 --> 00:00:50.100
my eyes. And I don't have enough toilet paper to wipe the. I mean,

12
00:00:50.101 --> 00:00:52.620
I do now because I thanks for the manager at Walgreens,

13
00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:56.360
but toilet paper is scarce. So, but what I'm saying is, yeah, you just,

14
00:00:56.390 --> 00:00:59.630
you know, I used to keep the block hot. You know, if you know me,

15
00:01:00.380 --> 00:01:04.670
two things I'm down for and sucking in the log cabin.

16
00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:07.490
I love standup comedy. I love my family.

17
00:01:07.730 --> 00:01:11.690
And also the thing I'm talking about, which I forgot.

18
00:01:12.680 --> 00:01:17.180
What was it? The, Oh, I ran, I kept the block hot I'm cold water,

19
00:01:17.210 --> 00:01:19.490
coffee bean. I kept that block. So hot.

20
00:01:19.820 --> 00:01:22.610
I swear to God people thought it was going to erupt. Now that's just the.

21
00:01:22.850 --> 00:01:24.800
That was the word on my block. Now I didn't make that.

22
00:01:25.340 --> 00:01:27.920
That was what people were saying. People said to me,

23
00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:32.270
what's up with this concrete? Why is it says Olin? All right.

24
00:01:33.350 --> 00:01:36.890
Don't want to get into it too much. But I kept that blood hot dude.

25
00:01:37.820 --> 00:01:41.600
I would go BG to go. I would get the Cobb salad. I would hop on over.

26
00:01:41.601 --> 00:01:44.250
Like I was in the children's book. And just walk into that coffee bean,

27
00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:47.510
I'd say hello to an old racist guy. And I'd be like, when I said Americano,

28
00:01:47.530 --> 00:01:50.660
please. And that guy was a racist as. He's probably dead now, but he,

29
00:01:50.690 --> 00:01:54.380
one time he was on a flip phone. Yeah. Yes. I know he's busy,

30
00:01:54.381 --> 00:01:57.860
but I'm trying to get in touch with the mayor. Yes, I understand. I know.

31
00:01:57.950 --> 00:02:01.460
But I want to talk to the mayor about what he's doing with all these illegal

32
00:02:01.461 --> 00:02:04.850
immigrants. Okay, cool. That's what he said. So that's how you know,

33
00:02:04.851 --> 00:02:08.690
this coffee bean was hot as, but this guy, one time a guy came in with a,

34
00:02:09.740 --> 00:02:11.900
I don't even know what to call that. I don't want to be racist,

35
00:02:11.901 --> 00:02:15.020
but it was a black guy. And he was wearing one of those things that just,

36
00:02:15.021 --> 00:02:17.780
you don't see in America, you see in like Africa, maybe he was African.

37
00:02:17.781 --> 00:02:21.860
I have no idea, but one of those things, that was just one piece that,

38
00:02:21.980 --> 00:02:24.230
but all wrapped around, it was like, Trump's hair, you know,

39
00:02:24.530 --> 00:02:26.360
we're like start somewhere, but you don't know where,

40
00:02:26.780 --> 00:02:30.170
but that's what this African guy was wearing. Just one piece, no pants,

41
00:02:30.171 --> 00:02:35.000
no shirt, one piece that was just wrapping around his, his shoulder, his feet,

42
00:02:35.150 --> 00:02:35.983
you know?

43
00:02:36.290 --> 00:02:40.970
And he was just floating in like Orco from He-Man and he got the thing

44
00:02:41.270 --> 00:02:44.540
and the racist guy, the old guy said, Hey.

45
00:02:46.880 --> 00:02:48.860
<v 1>Uh, when in Rome? Huh? And.</v>

46
00:02:49.490 --> 00:02:52.040
<v 0>Well, what's this about?</v>

47
00:02:52.970 --> 00:02:57.680
He says when and Roma and the guy says, excuse me, sir. Yes. He says,

48
00:02:58.280 --> 00:03:00.940
why don't you dress us? And I go,

49
00:03:04.540 --> 00:03:05.650
I knew what was going to happen.

50
00:03:05.651 --> 00:03:08.290
I knew that the guy being talked to is going to be so peaceful,

51
00:03:08.291 --> 00:03:09.071
just because of what he's wearing.

52
00:03:09.071 --> 00:03:10.720
People who wear stuff like that are super peaceful.

53
00:03:10.750 --> 00:03:15.100
You know what I'm talking about? Uh, the more articles of clothing you have,

54
00:03:15.101 --> 00:03:18.370
the less peaceful you are. Like if you have one thing wrapped around a Toga,

55
00:03:18.400 --> 00:03:20.080
or if you're wearing nothing, you know how peaceful you are.

56
00:03:20.081 --> 00:03:24.340
If you just have a leaf around your, but this old guy had on jeans,

57
00:03:24.490 --> 00:03:28.140
shoes, a button down, walking shirt over it,

58
00:03:28.230 --> 00:03:31.320
and also a briefcase. He would bring a briefcase,

59
00:03:31.321 --> 00:03:34.620
like an old-school one that looked like a Lego, like a briefcase, not a duffle,

60
00:03:34.621 --> 00:03:37.980
a briefcase, put it on the table, open it up.

61
00:03:38.010 --> 00:03:42.420
Like it was the that pulp fiction centered around with the gold inside of it.

62
00:03:42.720 --> 00:03:44.880
And he would open it up and I, you not, dude,

63
00:03:45.030 --> 00:03:49.830
this guy would pull out ness quick in his briefcase and

64
00:03:49.831 --> 00:03:54.650
whatever he got from the bar, he would put nest quick in it, stirred around,

65
00:03:54.660 --> 00:03:58.800
put it back in his briefcase case, close it up. All right. Now here's the thing,

66
00:03:59.070 --> 00:04:02.100
you know, that guy's racist just from the briefcase.

67
00:04:02.550 --> 00:04:06.360
But this guy came in and the guy goes like this when in Roma. And he says,

68
00:04:06.420 --> 00:04:10.050
excuse me, so what he says, why don't you dress like us? You're a far from home.

69
00:04:10.380 --> 00:04:14.900
This is America. And the, and the guy said, I, you know what, I,

70
00:04:15.070 --> 00:04:19.110
I should, I, why don't I? Yeah, maybe I should. Yeah. You know what to say?

71
00:04:19.111 --> 00:04:23.370
But then he was like, I pray for you, sir. And he left and I was like, God dude,

72
00:04:23.520 --> 00:04:27.840
to be that outwardly racist before Trump is

73
00:04:27.841 --> 00:04:31.350
crazy. All right. Anyway, I kept that blog. Huh?

74
00:04:34.020 --> 00:04:35.280
<v 2>And uh.</v>

75
00:04:37.710 --> 00:04:39.630
<v 0>The coffee bean has become my main state.</v>

76
00:04:39.660 --> 00:04:41.520
And I've been through a lot of with coffee bean, man.

77
00:04:41.521 --> 00:04:43.410
Sometimes I drink the coffee. When I first got out the car, I was like,

78
00:04:43.411 --> 00:04:45.300
the coffee sucks. And then I started liking it.

79
00:04:45.301 --> 00:04:48.180
And then I started drinking different coffee that people were like,

80
00:04:48.181 --> 00:04:51.990
but this is the hot. I don't like the boutique coffee shops that often,

81
00:04:52.050 --> 00:04:55.080
often overdo their. And I'm not about that life, dude.

82
00:04:55.081 --> 00:04:58.680
And I'm also not about the sweet Brown,

83
00:04:58.710 --> 00:05:02.760
like the brownie put the Dunkin Hein in the oven. I'll scarf it down. You don't,

84
00:05:02.761 --> 00:05:07.320
I don't want extra on the thing. I want to go to a gourmet place. You know,

85
00:05:07.321 --> 00:05:10.170
there's always like some new place popping up in LA. That's just like, Hey,

86
00:05:10.171 --> 00:05:13.080
you got to check out. It's just the artisinal ice cream place. Oh yeah.

87
00:05:13.470 --> 00:05:18.270
Put the hog and dies in my mouth. I'm not taking. Yeah.

88
00:05:18.271 --> 00:05:21.510
But they give you a pretzel to scoop it out with and you eat it with the

89
00:05:21.511 --> 00:05:24.630
pretzel. Oh yeah, go yourself. Ice cream has been around for years.

90
00:05:24.660 --> 00:05:29.460
Centuries ice cream has literally been around for billions of years, literally

91
00:05:31.080 --> 00:05:32.160
billions of years,

92
00:05:32.550 --> 00:05:35.760
billions of ice creams all around the world from different times.

93
00:05:36.690 --> 00:05:41.250
And um, anyway, I take my ice cream.

94
00:05:41.251 --> 00:05:43.230
Haagen-Dazs one time I was in a mice.

95
00:05:43.260 --> 00:05:47.760
My mom's suburban as a high school kid and my, and my, and, and one of her, uh,

96
00:05:48.720 --> 00:05:52.710
cousins, uh, sons was over and he was so funny. He's from New Jersey.

97
00:05:53.010 --> 00:05:57.000
And my brother said, uh, my brother's talking about how a girl liked.

98
00:05:57.080 --> 00:05:58.340
And he said, yeah, well, I can't help it.

99
00:05:58.341 --> 00:06:02.320
She wanted my Haagen Daz and my friend from New Jersey. Oh,

100
00:06:02.321 --> 00:06:03.730
you got hugging guys back there.

101
00:06:03.790 --> 00:06:08.200
And I pulled over and laughed, dude,

102
00:06:08.320 --> 00:06:12.340
I got Haagen Dass back there. Ah,

103
00:06:13.450 --> 00:06:18.130
Oh, man. I love like that. So anyway,

104
00:06:18.160 --> 00:06:21.220
I keep the black hot coffee bean and I we've been together, dude.

105
00:06:21.221 --> 00:06:25.690
We're an odd couple. You understand? So, um,

106
00:06:28.060 --> 00:06:32.530
so I go to this coffee bean during this

107
00:06:32.531 --> 00:06:37.300
pandemic, I got my N 95 mask on. I got my hands in my.

108
00:06:38.110 --> 00:06:42.400
You know, I'm touching doors. If I have to, if I'm not, I don't.

109
00:06:44.380 --> 00:06:48.340
If I'm with someone, which I never am, I haven't touched, you know, my friends,

110
00:06:48.700 --> 00:06:52.780
I go like this, you open it, you get it. You'll get it. You get COVID

111
00:06:54.340 --> 00:06:56.890
and they go, all right. I guess I'm, you know,

112
00:06:56.920 --> 00:07:01.000
maybe going to get COVID and I walk into the thing and I got my N 95 mask and my

113
00:07:01.001 --> 00:07:04.690
buddy Mark, is there. The guy who opened for me sometimes, and he's Irish.

114
00:07:04.691 --> 00:07:09.040
And he goes like this a lot. Oh, seriously. Or begins every sentence with here.

115
00:07:10.810 --> 00:07:15.460
Here. What time is the show? Why'd you say here at the beginning of that,

116
00:07:16.090 --> 00:07:21.010
why are you adding words? So I'm there. And a guy walks in with a mask,

117
00:07:21.850 --> 00:07:23.950
a mask, you know,

118
00:07:23.951 --> 00:07:28.600
one of those ones that nurses wear and also a headband

119
00:07:29.110 --> 00:07:33.880
with a glass shield over it homemade. Now the guy's in his seventies. Okay.

120
00:07:34.180 --> 00:07:38.980
And I respect it. I'm like, all right, this guy is taking this COVID.

121
00:07:39.160 --> 00:07:42.760
Seriously. He's also a little bit older, more at risk, you know,

122
00:07:42.761 --> 00:07:45.430
maybe Brian Callan's age. And I'm like, that's great.

123
00:07:46.300 --> 00:07:49.990
So he says to,

124
00:07:51.370 --> 00:07:54.310
so, Oh, by the way, Mark is a color that doesn't exist.

125
00:07:55.270 --> 00:07:57.280
I should have started this with this.

126
00:07:57.460 --> 00:08:02.440
My friend Mark is a color that doesn't exist yet.

127
00:08:03.070 --> 00:08:07.630
Do you understand? He's a mix of translucent

128
00:08:09.250 --> 00:08:14.020
and beige. Okay. It was like the movie,

129
00:08:14.080 --> 00:08:18.010
remember the movie powder, how the guy was so white,

130
00:08:19.300 --> 00:08:23.170
like Mark would have auditioned for this. And they would have been like, well,

131
00:08:23.171 --> 00:08:25.030
we need it to be more believable.

132
00:08:25.930 --> 00:08:29.440
So we're going to use the guy and just put actual makeup on him.

133
00:08:30.130 --> 00:08:35.020
We want people to watch it because Mark looks like a potato

134
00:08:35.021 --> 00:08:37.840
that we left out too long. You understand?

135
00:08:39.660 --> 00:08:44.380
It's so, and his head hair are pubes. So he, uh,

136
00:08:44.410 --> 00:08:48.520
yeah. So, so like when he gets a haircut, they say, what do you, when he says,

137
00:08:48.910 --> 00:08:51.010
you're a pubes. And so, um,

138
00:08:52.420 --> 00:08:56.220
so he is always translucent and beige. Okay.

139
00:08:56.880 --> 00:08:58.170
And he's because of this,

140
00:08:58.171 --> 00:09:01.370
there's definitely something going on with his immune system.

141
00:09:01.880 --> 00:09:05.600
And Mark's been sniffling since I've met him since I've met him. Yeah.

142
00:09:05.680 --> 00:09:07.520
<v 1>I'd be like, Oh, Kira.</v>

143
00:09:10.430 --> 00:09:13.220
<v 0>And you're just like, is that a, not just an Irish thing? Like, I don't know.</v>

144
00:09:14.090 --> 00:09:18.710
So he's doing his Mark and the

145
00:09:19.160 --> 00:09:21.500
70 something year old says, Hey man,

146
00:09:21.501 --> 00:09:26.330
you're sniffling from across the coffee bean. And I go, I miss this place,

147
00:09:26.331 --> 00:09:30.740
man. This guy's the new racist. The sky. This block is hot.

148
00:09:30.741 --> 00:09:32.780
Now coffee bean is where it's at.

149
00:09:32.960 --> 00:09:36.770
There's always one crazy person in a coffee shop. And when that person leaves,

150
00:09:37.010 --> 00:09:39.950
ding, ding, ding, another guy comes in and is like,

151
00:09:39.980 --> 00:09:44.360
you guys heard of pizza gate. So this guy says, Hey,

152
00:09:44.361 --> 00:09:47.930
you're sniffling. And Mark says something that I understand,

153
00:09:48.050 --> 00:09:51.950
but the guy doesn't understand because when Mark talks for the first time to

154
00:09:51.951 --> 00:09:56.510
somebody he's inaudible because he's so Irish. My brother,

155
00:09:57.230 --> 00:10:00.290
I remember once, um, my brother, when he met Mark,

156
00:10:00.980 --> 00:10:05.030
Mark said something like here [inaudible] and my brother said what?

157
00:10:05.990 --> 00:10:10.820
Jeff's like that. And I fell out, okay. Now, uh, this guy said, Mark says, uh,

158
00:10:11.120 --> 00:10:15.740
here, uh, it's just, it's nothing. And the guy says what you shouldn't be out.

159
00:10:16.280 --> 00:10:19.610
And Mark goes, it looks at me. And he's like, nah, it's just sniffling.

160
00:10:19.611 --> 00:10:23.360
It's nothing. I, I don't have it. And I'm like.

161
00:10:23.660 --> 00:10:27.140
<v 1>Oh wait. Oh. Yeah. COVID.</v>

162
00:10:28.280 --> 00:10:32.090
<v 0>And so, um, so the guy says, yeah, you're sniffling. You shouldn't be out.</v>

163
00:10:32.390 --> 00:10:36.920
And I'm laughing, dude, because your boy's a near dwell.

164
00:10:37.010 --> 00:10:38.840
I'm loving it. I'm like this.

165
00:10:39.650 --> 00:10:44.240
I'm like a goalie before they drop that soccer ball in. Right.

166
00:10:44.660 --> 00:10:49.640
And, uh, and he, um, and he says, yeah, you, you,

167
00:10:49.641 --> 00:10:53.450
you, you, you, you, if you're compromised, you shouldn't be out in public.

168
00:10:53.690 --> 00:10:56.750
You should be wearing a mask at least. And I'm like, Hey man, he,

169
00:10:56.751 --> 00:10:59.300
he doesn't have it. He's, always, I've known the guy for ever.

170
00:10:59.301 --> 00:11:02.390
He doesn't have it. He's, he's always sniffling it as annoying as.

171
00:11:02.630 --> 00:11:07.010
It's one of his things. It's a tick I said, and the guy says, yeah, well, I'm,

172
00:11:07.490 --> 00:11:12.080
um, I'm 72. So, you know, if I get it, it's bad news. And I was like, buddy,

173
00:11:12.290 --> 00:11:15.050
it's all good. Don't worry about it. And that was when I was like, man,

174
00:11:15.051 --> 00:11:17.420
I could really see this going and getting out of control.
