WEBVTT

1
00:00:00.690 --> 00:00:02.730
<v 0>I love being here. I love being a guy. I know we always,</v>

2
00:00:02.970 --> 00:00:06.690
you know how girls are like girl power nowadays and like that and how they do

3
00:00:06.691 --> 00:00:10.410
that thing. That's how much I love being a guy, guy power, you know,

4
00:00:10.890 --> 00:00:14.010
like I love being a guy. Here's why dude,

5
00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:18.090
all weekend we roasted my opener because he's five, nine.

6
00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:22.320
And he's trying to say he's five 10 and a half, bro. First of all,

7
00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:27.120
who says, and a half, if you're tall, you don't do that.

8
00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:30.390
So he says he's five, 10 and a half. That's how you know, he's really five,

9
00:00:30.391 --> 00:00:34.650
nine. You're a shrimp boat dude. And it's fine.

10
00:00:35.220 --> 00:00:38.010
It's fine. It's fine. He's five nine, but it's fine. And you,

11
00:00:38.020 --> 00:00:40.470
and he gets so mad and we were laughing.

12
00:00:40.471 --> 00:00:44.280
We were laughing so hard telling him how he was five, nine and. And he was like,

13
00:00:44.281 --> 00:00:47.280
bro, bro, I'm not five nine. If I find that the Craig's five,

14
00:00:47.281 --> 00:00:51.140
eight and Joe's five, seven. And I'm like, I guess so bro. And it was like,

15
00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:54.120
how tall is Brad Williams? And I was like, he's 42.

16
00:00:55.830 --> 00:01:00.510
Then he's two, four, uh, he's a, uh,

17
00:01:00.630 --> 00:01:05.550
little person or whatever you call it. I don't know how tall Brad Williams is,

18
00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:10.680
but whatever dude, my opener is five nine and Mark and I are always four, four.

19
00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:17.520
Um, my opener and I are, uh, my opener Mark and I are for our far,

20
00:01:17.521 --> 00:01:19.590
far nine feet tall.

21
00:01:19.591 --> 00:01:23.130
So he's so he's five nine.

22
00:01:23.131 --> 00:01:26.790
And we were busting them on it and he was getting so mad, but we were laughing,

23
00:01:26.791 --> 00:01:31.590
dude. We were laughing. I love that as guys girls can't do that.

24
00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:36.810
If a girl was like, whatever, you're short, you're ugly. You're fat and ugly.

25
00:01:37.290 --> 00:01:39.450
You can't be friends with that cheque. You'd be like,

26
00:01:39.480 --> 00:01:42.930
Oh that girl's done being my friend. But guys,

27
00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:44.550
that means you're a friend.

28
00:01:47.540 --> 00:01:48.200
<v 1>[Inaudible].</v>

29
00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:51.620
<v 0>Bro. You're fat. You think I don't look at my friends' faces and say, bro,</v>

30
00:01:51.740 --> 00:01:56.720
you fat. What's up with your face. You're ugly. That's it dude.

31
00:01:56.750 --> 00:01:58.820
That's it. That's the best we cry laughing.

32
00:02:00.050 --> 00:02:04.160
That's what it's like being a guy all weekend. He was like, all right,

33
00:02:04.161 --> 00:02:07.820
so that's the theme. So I'm five, nine. He's short though. It's all good.

34
00:02:08.840 --> 00:02:12.530
It kills him. He wants to be a a athletes so bad.

35
00:02:14.840 --> 00:02:18.050
He tweeted the other day. So dorky,

36
00:02:19.340 --> 00:02:21.050
look at this here. I'm going to look it up.

37
00:02:25.070 --> 00:02:25.400
<v 1>[Inaudible].</v>

38
00:02:25.400 --> 00:02:28.160
<v 0>He looked, he, he tweeted the other day when we landed,</v>

39
00:02:30.770 --> 00:02:35.300
here we go. Look at this NBA dude. He loves basketball.

40
00:02:36.800 --> 00:02:39.830
And he was like looking at the and he was like, Oh dreads,

41
00:02:39.831 --> 00:02:40.880
going to Brooklyn or whatever the.

42
00:02:43.160 --> 00:02:47.360
And he kept checking and refreshing his pain page. And he tweeted this bro, my

43
00:02:49.220 --> 00:02:52.490
opener tweeted this NBA finals next four years,

44
00:02:53.030 --> 00:02:57.920
colon Lakers over Milwaukee Lakers over Brooklyn Lakers over Brooklyn Lakers

45
00:02:57.921 --> 00:03:01.390
over Brooklyn. And I wrote back LOL,

46
00:03:01.391 --> 00:03:04.060
what a dork do more years.

47
00:03:06.970 --> 00:03:09.160
And he was like, dude, that's not torquey. And I was like,

48
00:03:09.161 --> 00:03:13.390
how is it not dorky to predict who's going to win the NBA

49
00:03:13.391 --> 00:03:17.830
championships in the next four years, dude. That's exactly like being like,

50
00:03:18.250 --> 00:03:21.550
you know, you know, you know, this is my all right, so this is my prediction.

51
00:03:22.120 --> 00:03:23.950
Uh, basically, uh, the next move,

52
00:03:24.010 --> 00:03:27.310
the next Marvel movies in the Marvel universe that don't exist already. Okay.

53
00:03:27.311 --> 00:03:30.790
So they're going to absolutely. First of all, it just makes me laugh.

54
00:03:30.791 --> 00:03:33.700
How gambit doesn't have its own, uh, origin story, which is ridiculous.

55
00:03:33.850 --> 00:03:35.440
They never really explored the gambit character.

56
00:03:35.441 --> 00:03:39.670
And I think that in the new year, probably 2001, 2021, 2022,

57
00:03:39.760 --> 00:03:41.410
the old we'll probably explore camp at character.

58
00:03:41.411 --> 00:03:44.920
If the Marvel universe is still exploding the way it is, um,

59
00:03:45.130 --> 00:03:48.580
it has the chance of actually, um, you know,

60
00:03:48.820 --> 00:03:52.570
taking a dip because it, they are absolutely are over branding,

61
00:03:52.780 --> 00:03:55.540
but I would like to see Nightcrawler in his own thing.

62
00:03:55.980 --> 00:03:58.990
I'd like to see Jubilee in his own thing. And I predict also a gambit.

63
00:03:59.020 --> 00:04:01.360
Maybe I have his own origin story coming up. Um,

64
00:04:01.390 --> 00:04:03.520
if they can find a very cool French French character,

65
00:04:03.521 --> 00:04:05.350
because you know that gambit is a French character.

66
00:04:05.500 --> 00:04:08.770
If they can find a fringe character actor, I would like to see, um, uh,

67
00:04:08.800 --> 00:04:11.500
Alan Cummings maybe play him. I know he's not French, but he could,

68
00:04:11.530 --> 00:04:14.410
I could see him doing that. Like that's what you're doing.

69
00:04:14.470 --> 00:04:18.100
You dork predicting.

70
00:04:18.101 --> 00:04:21.100
Who's gonna win the championship on Twitter,

71
00:04:21.160 --> 00:04:24.760
not just in conversation and be like, Oh, I can see yada yada on Twitter.

72
00:04:24.940 --> 00:04:26.200
And you're just a comedian.

73
00:04:26.380 --> 00:04:29.950
And you say Lakers over Brooklyn in 2000 and 22,

74
00:04:30.700 --> 00:04:33.730
you're basically a kid.

75
00:04:33.790 --> 00:04:36.190
You're basically an adult living with your parents in the basement.

76
00:04:36.340 --> 00:04:39.940
That's a chart, it's a chart. It's all good, sweetheart.

77
00:04:42.310 --> 00:04:47.230
You're basically saying, well, I mean, you know, I would love to see, um,

78
00:04:47.260 --> 00:04:51.100
basically, uh, I don't know why, uh,

79
00:04:53.050 --> 00:04:54.010
I can't think of another. They have made,

80
00:04:54.011 --> 00:04:56.680
so Marvel has made so many movies with all the characters that came in.

81
00:04:56.920 --> 00:05:01.270
I would love to see, um, w what's his name? Who's the cyborg.

82
00:05:01.300 --> 00:05:03.100
I'd love to see cyborg have his own origin story.

83
00:05:03.190 --> 00:05:06.400
That's basically what you're doing. That's basically what you're doing.

84
00:05:07.080 --> 00:05:07.913
<v 1>Okay.</v>

85
00:05:11.130 --> 00:05:15.480
<v 0>So if you like sports, that's all good. But if you tweet about predictions,</v>

86
00:05:15.960 --> 00:05:19.050
the whole thing, I just can't believe. I know I'm in the minority here.

87
00:05:19.051 --> 00:05:22.350
I know sports is huge, but I just can't believe that guys for real do that.

88
00:05:22.800 --> 00:05:27.750
There'll be like on ESPN, ESPN talking about how,

89
00:05:27.751 --> 00:05:32.670
who they think will win the, uh, Oh, you know, it looks good.

90
00:05:32.690 --> 00:05:34.980
It looks good. If it looks good. Good, good

91
00:05:37.480 --> 00:05:40.140
looks good. It looks good. I, you know, it looks good. You know,

92
00:05:40.141 --> 00:05:43.040
we thought that Kevin Duran, wasn't going to be around next year. And we,

93
00:05:43.041 --> 00:05:44.340
you know, he probably won't be around next year,

94
00:05:44.341 --> 00:05:46.230
but perhaps the Brooklyn for giving them a shot,

95
00:05:46.410 --> 00:05:48.210
they get to rehabilitate him a little bit, get them to go,

96
00:05:48.220 --> 00:05:50.850
come back stronger than ever. You know, I don't know, Frank, you know,

97
00:05:50.851 --> 00:05:54.600
I'm not sure because you've been through this killing terrible. A lot of people,

98
00:05:54.601 --> 00:05:57.170
of course, Colby had it. There's always that guy there's always got,

99
00:05:57.171 --> 00:05:58.040
it sounds like this, you.

100
00:05:58.040 --> 00:06:00.680
<v 2>Know, the guys that like, he's good with the blue collar guys, you know,</v>

101
00:06:00.770 --> 00:06:02.030
you got to have the guys that know stuff,

102
00:06:02.120 --> 00:06:04.760
but there's also this guy who's just a regular person.

103
00:06:04.910 --> 00:06:07.400
And he's going to be telling you basically how it is from the ground up.

104
00:06:07.520 --> 00:06:08.990
You know, you guys know when you're high towers,

105
00:06:09.070 --> 00:06:11.810
basically all your money in Hollywood, what's going on,

106
00:06:11.960 --> 00:06:15.590
but I know what's going on. If I'm down here, uh, Dan, and I can tell you,

107
00:06:15.800 --> 00:06:19.190
LeBron, I don't know. I love,

108
00:06:21.440 --> 00:06:24.110
I don't know if a Tombo could do it yet. He's tall, but he's a leg.

109
00:06:24.111 --> 00:06:26.090
You son of a, you know, put them in a set of five.

110
00:06:26.091 --> 00:06:28.220
But if he's outside the three front line, you know,

111
00:06:28.221 --> 00:06:30.290
it's going to cause me a point of view.

112
00:06:30.890 --> 00:06:34.070
I'm not sure if he can make [inaudible] MBA. You know,

113
00:06:36.320 --> 00:06:40.580
Anyway, I gotta go back to the dock. He load these. I hope my analysis was,

114
00:06:40.670 --> 00:06:41.503
was pure.

115
00:06:43.840 --> 00:06:44.321
<v 0>Thank you.</v>

116
00:06:44.321 --> 00:06:49.210
Talking to a dock worker just to get views from a dock workers I

117
00:06:49.840 --> 00:06:50.673
live.

118
00:06:51.610 --> 00:06:54.820
<v 2>But this is my prediction is NBA finals the next four years, right?</v>

119
00:06:54.970 --> 00:06:57.850
This is what I think was just going to happen in the Marvel universe and index

120
00:06:58.060 --> 00:06:58.893
for years. All right.

121
00:06:58.930 --> 00:07:03.730
So what I think is possibly cyborg could have his own origin story and that's

122
00:07:03.731 --> 00:07:05.410
just coming from a lowly dark worker.

123
00:07:05.890 --> 00:07:08.260
But my buddy who also work in cement concrete,

124
00:07:08.500 --> 00:07:11.170
they think that maybe Jubilee mice should make an appearance.

125
00:07:11.380 --> 00:07:12.970
And what are the next few X-Men movies?

126
00:07:13.180 --> 00:07:17.860
And then could possibly have an origin story. Or interestingly enough,

127
00:07:18.070 --> 00:07:21.130
the DC universe could do a movie with an old Batman.

128
00:07:21.160 --> 00:07:23.680
I see what maybe a John ham in the next few years,

129
00:07:23.830 --> 00:07:28.420
or possibly even a black guy, um, you know, I could see you to,

130
00:07:28.780 --> 00:07:31.440
but doing it, you know, because all the whole thing going on with,

131
00:07:31.600 --> 00:07:34.810
with everything we did to try to make everybody equal, I could see that coming.

132
00:07:34.990 --> 00:07:36.940
That's just coming from a lowly doc worker.

133
00:07:37.150 --> 00:07:40.090
But my buddy that works at construction, he also thinks the same thing.

134
00:07:40.330 --> 00:07:44.290
I would say thing. So you. We, I flew in towers in your Marvel universe,

135
00:07:44.470 --> 00:07:45.340
but that's what we think.

136
00:07:45.700 --> 00:07:46.420
<v 0>Thanks a lot.</v>
