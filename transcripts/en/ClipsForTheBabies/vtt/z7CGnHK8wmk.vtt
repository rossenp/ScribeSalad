00:00:01.380 --> 00:00:03.180
<v 0>They were trying to sign petition, dude,</v>

2
00:00:03.570 --> 00:00:06.150
this is the other thing about the Robert Pattinson playing Batman.

3
00:00:06.210 --> 00:00:08.160
Like he's going to maybe probably get the Batman part

4
00:00:12.390 --> 00:00:16.920
and then there are people like, no, no, no, no way. I can't see him as Batman.

5
00:00:16.921 --> 00:00:19.620
Well guess who care? The people who were creating Batman

6
00:00:23.780 --> 00:00:25.820
also. What do these people,

7
00:00:25.940 --> 00:00:30.860
these people who think Robert Pattinson shouldn't play Batman.

8
00:00:31.100 --> 00:00:33.830
I'm all for it. By the way. Go ahead. Go ahead.

9
00:00:33.890 --> 00:00:35.000
He looks like he could be Batman.

10
00:00:35.240 --> 00:00:39.590
You're only saying that he can't play Batman straight up.

11
00:00:39.770 --> 00:00:42.320
You're only saying that because of Twilight. Okay.

12
00:00:43.460 --> 00:00:47.510
And you're saying that because that people just want it to hate that show

13
00:00:47.570 --> 00:00:50.510
because it was a, it was for teenage girls and you're like, Oh,

14
00:00:50.511 --> 00:00:54.050
that's so or it's so corny. It's so stupid. It's not actually good.

15
00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:59.900
But you saying no way,

16
00:01:00.080 --> 00:01:04.910
I won't stand for Robert Pattinson playing Batman and making a petition

17
00:01:05.030 --> 00:01:09.500
and about it online makes you a

18
00:01:09.590 --> 00:01:14.510
teenage girl. So what the he are?

19
00:01:14.511 --> 00:01:15.380
What you hate?

20
00:01:16.550 --> 00:01:20.000
You don't like Robert Pattinson playing Batman because he was on Twilight

21
00:01:20.001 --> 00:01:23.360
because you didn't like that because it was for teenage girls.

22
00:01:23.990 --> 00:01:28.880
So you go online and you start a petition or sign a petition about how Robert

23
00:01:28.881 --> 00:01:33.500
Pattinson would be a bad Batman and how he shouldn't play it because

24
00:01:33.800 --> 00:01:37.250
you're a teenage girl. That's what happened.

25
00:01:38.330 --> 00:01:39.380
You're no better than that.

26
00:01:43.190 --> 00:01:45.650
Chu doin chill.

27
00:01:49.220 --> 00:01:53.480
You 45 year old bellied out type typist,

28
00:01:53.600 --> 00:01:58.580
just complaining and online about how Robert Peck. that. Why can't he be Batman?

29
00:01:59.150 --> 00:02:02.780
Because he was in Twilight. So what were those movies? Corny show. What?

30
00:02:03.020 --> 00:02:07.490
You know, what's corny. A guy dressing up as a bat.

31
00:02:11.420 --> 00:02:12.620
It's all corny. Dude.

32
00:02:18.050 --> 00:02:19.460
Let them pick it.

33
00:02:19.490 --> 00:02:23.060
People thought Michael Keaton back when wouldn't be a good Batman.

34
00:02:23.660 --> 00:02:27.470
Imagine if the internet existed, they'd be up in arms. You're not going to dude.

35
00:02:27.530 --> 00:02:30.830
You don't matter. You don't matter, dude.

36
00:02:31.250 --> 00:02:35.600
If you're making a petition about the

37
00:02:36.110 --> 00:02:40.730
Sonic, the hedgehog, it's like, dude, you don't that,

38
00:02:40.770 --> 00:02:43.070
that was crazy. When people are like, Oh,

39
00:02:43.100 --> 00:02:45.800
Sonic the hedgehog or men know like,

40
00:02:45.870 --> 00:02:49.670
why all this hate on the way, Sonic the hedgehog in the movie who cares?

41
00:02:49.671 --> 00:02:54.650
And then the producers, I think they actually went back and were like,

42
00:02:54.651 --> 00:02:59.590
all right, well, we're going to dude. You Bucklin. that.

43
00:03:01.120 --> 00:03:05.270
Ah, I don't know, man. Maybe I got the one.

44
00:03:05.350 --> 00:03:07.090
Maybe I'm the one with the problem. If I was a producer,

45
00:03:07.091 --> 00:03:09.610
Sonic the hedgehog and then somebody was like, dude, no way.

46
00:03:09.611 --> 00:03:11.350
That's not how it should look. Guess what happened?

47
00:03:12.040 --> 00:03:14.170
You just solidified the way it looked.

48
00:03:15.910 --> 00:03:20.110
Stand up for it, specially for some dumb like Sonic the hedgehog man.

49
00:03:22.420 --> 00:03:26.290
Come on, dude. Dude.

50
00:03:28.030 --> 00:03:32.440
Just, just think about complaining.

51
00:03:33.580 --> 00:03:35.920
Just think for a second

52
00:03:37.900 --> 00:03:41.740
about complaining about something called Sonic the hedgehog.

53
00:03:44.290 --> 00:03:49.240
Like it's a blue hedgehog with

54
00:03:49.690 --> 00:03:53.470
sneakers on K

55
00:03:57.450 --> 00:03:58.620
And you're 40

56
00:04:04.020 --> 00:04:05.760
also. I swear to God.

57
00:04:05.790 --> 00:04:10.440
I thought it looked cool when I was like, Oh wait, people are hating on this.

58
00:04:10.470 --> 00:04:11.303
I was like,

59
00:04:15.090 --> 00:04:17.940
I love this artist fixes live action, Sonic the hedgehog.

60
00:04:18.300 --> 00:04:21.150
And then like it got like a million retweets or some.

61
00:04:22.980 --> 00:04:27.780
And it's just like the only thing he did is make his Dick area less

62
00:04:29.160 --> 00:04:30.540
and he made them shorter a little bit

63
00:04:35.820 --> 00:04:40.320
and it got 89,000 likes. Oh no, sorry.

64
00:04:41.010 --> 00:04:44.730
325,000 likes. If you like that,

65
00:04:44.731 --> 00:04:49.620
you're a dork straight up first to go. Here you go. Get out there.
