1
00:00:00.040 --> 00:00:04.260
<v 0>A little bit DMX. Um, dude, I, uh,</v>

2
00:00:04.320 --> 00:00:07.650
I don't really know where to start this podcast, to be honest it's uh,

3
00:00:07.860 --> 00:00:10.200
cause yesterday was the day that, um,

4
00:00:10.230 --> 00:00:13.950
I don't want to start with on too much of a down downer, but like,

5
00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:16.950
I found out, you know,

6
00:00:16.951 --> 00:00:21.810
Kobe Bryant died like at noon yesterday when I was waking up bright and

7
00:00:21.811 --> 00:00:26.550
early at noon. And, um, I just couldn't believe it, man.

8
00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:30.960
Um, I couldn't, I couldn't believe it.

9
00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:35.700
It's so weird that he died and the way he did,

10
00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:39.000
I got to say, first of all, I cried like all day,

11
00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:40.440
which I'm not trying to make it about me,

12
00:00:40.441 --> 00:00:44.670
but it's so weird that I cried all day because I, I didn't really,

13
00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:48.660
I don't care about basketball. I don't, uh,

14
00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:52.860
I don't know much about Coby except for, you know, he, um,

15
00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:57.570
you know, he played basketball. He's one of the greatest of all time. And, uh,

16
00:00:57.990 --> 00:01:02.340
and I just don't, I don't know if I, uh, I didn't know, I cared that much.

17
00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:07.230
And then when I found that out about how he's 41 and a helicopter crash,

18
00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:11.190
I don't, I also, like, I'd never witnessed somebody,

19
00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:16.830
uh, a turn, the air off it's bugging me. I never noticed about, um,

20
00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:22.050
I never noticed how much, like there were,

21
00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:25.020
so in my life, somebody dying like prematurely,

22
00:01:25.021 --> 00:01:29.640
or like even the Robin Williams thing or the, uh,

23
00:01:29.790 --> 00:01:34.710
Michael Jackson, I was 29 when Michael Jackson died. And Robin Williams,

24
00:01:34.711 --> 00:01:36.060
when he died, it was like six years ago.

25
00:01:36.061 --> 00:01:39.840
And Robin Williams was in like in my circle, in my life, like,

26
00:01:39.870 --> 00:01:44.640
like we talked about him all the time, I'm a comedian, he was a comedian. Um,

27
00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:49.680
I met Robin Williams once and talked with him for a little bit and just, um,

28
00:01:50.400 --> 00:01:53.580
that was rough. But for some reason,

29
00:01:53.581 --> 00:01:57.390
the Kobe Bryant thing really hit me hard. Like, I mean,

30
00:01:57.391 --> 00:01:59.010
maybe it's because we're the same age,

31
00:01:59.040 --> 00:02:00.780
maybe it's cause I'm going to be a dad or some.

32
00:02:01.530 --> 00:02:06.060
And his daughter was in the helicopter and it just really.

33
00:02:06.690 --> 00:02:08.490
And it me up the whole day.

34
00:02:08.700 --> 00:02:13.620
And I had a show in Irvine and I wasn't sure if I was

35
00:02:13.621 --> 00:02:15.180
going to be able to do it the way I do. I mean,

36
00:02:15.181 --> 00:02:17.100
I knew I'd be able to go on stage and you know, I'm a professional,

37
00:02:17.101 --> 00:02:20.640
I'll be able to get on stage and do the. But I wasn't sure if I was gonna,

38
00:02:22.140 --> 00:02:24.480
you know, give,

39
00:02:24.510 --> 00:02:28.560
be able to do it a hundred percent now, you know, I was able to,

40
00:02:28.561 --> 00:02:30.930
I got on stage and it was all good. It was fine. Which I don't know.

41
00:02:30.930 --> 00:02:35.400
Maybe I just like, was crying for I four or five times.

42
00:02:36.480 --> 00:02:39.360
I just like people would send me videos of what, of him.

43
00:02:39.361 --> 00:02:42.630
And then an hour before Showtime, I was like, all right, you guys,

44
00:02:42.631 --> 00:02:46.320
you gotta stop, man. I can't, I'm going to be like upset on stage.

45
00:02:46.350 --> 00:02:47.550
I just didn't know.

46
00:02:48.240 --> 00:02:52.380
I'm surprised how big of a deal he was to the world.

47
00:02:52.381 --> 00:02:54.330
Like there's nobody who didn't know who Colby Bryan was.

48
00:02:54.810 --> 00:02:58.020
Everybody knows who Kobe Bryant is. You're seven years old.

49
00:02:58.021 --> 00:03:00.820
You know who Kobe Bryant is. And he only retired like three years ago,

50
00:03:00.821 --> 00:03:05.110
which I didn't even realize three, four years ago. It's still fun.

51
00:03:05.111 --> 00:03:07.420
It kind of felt like he played basketball in a way.

52
00:03:08.290 --> 00:03:09.970
And then the thing the other night,

53
00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:14.470
like the 10 hours before LeBron passed him in scoring or whatever it was. And,

54
00:03:14.770 --> 00:03:17.020
and then Colby was in the news the night before,

55
00:03:17.021 --> 00:03:21.220
and then in the news for being celebrated and then in the news for being so such

56
00:03:21.610 --> 00:03:25.810
in such a tragedy, it was just so awful, man. I just,

57
00:03:26.260 --> 00:03:31.180
my heart goes out to his family and, and I mean, dude,

58
00:03:32.140 --> 00:03:34.840
I was watching some of the clips, like people were just talking about how,

59
00:03:34.841 --> 00:03:39.160
like he put LA, he made LA cool again. He made LA I, it just,

60
00:03:39.370 --> 00:03:40.660
I don't realize like, you know,

61
00:03:40.661 --> 00:03:44.110
I make fun of my opener a lot because he likes sports and he's 35. And like,

62
00:03:44.111 --> 00:03:46.900
he doesn't, he's a comedian. I'm like, bro, just hang it up. You know,

63
00:03:47.380 --> 00:03:52.150
like stop shooting a basketball at the YMCA. You're 35,

64
00:03:52.210 --> 00:03:56.530
have a child. You know what I mean? Work on your jokes.

65
00:03:56.740 --> 00:03:58.930
The guy is so competitive. It's like, he's like,

66
00:03:58.990 --> 00:04:02.320
you don't think I could jump further than you I'm like, bro, I don't give a.

67
00:04:03.100 --> 00:04:07.330
I'm 39. You know,

68
00:04:08.200 --> 00:04:11.350
if you're not getting paid to do anything with a ball,

69
00:04:11.830 --> 00:04:16.030
give it up when you're 24. But my,

70
00:04:16.120 --> 00:04:19.600
my opener is just like, let's go, let's go. Let's play.

71
00:04:19.660 --> 00:04:21.520
You don't think I could do it. And I'm like,

72
00:04:21.580 --> 00:04:26.170
I don't not only do I not even think or not think I don't care,

73
00:04:26.560 --> 00:04:29.560
but the point is, is basketball

74
00:04:31.900 --> 00:04:35.500
when there's somebody like that, that transcends it. It's about an idea.

75
00:04:36.010 --> 00:04:40.180
It's about, it's not even him, which is it is him because you know,

76
00:04:40.181 --> 00:04:42.910
he's a real person. I don't want to take that away from him. You know, you, you,

77
00:04:42.911 --> 00:04:45.250
you make these people out to be bigger than they really are. And,

78
00:04:45.410 --> 00:04:47.890
and you think about how they don't have, you know, they're,

79
00:04:47.891 --> 00:04:50.440
you don't think of them as like real people, but he was a very real person,

80
00:04:50.441 --> 00:04:54.430
but like it becomes about, it becomes an idea. You know,

81
00:04:54.580 --> 00:04:59.110
like Kobe Bryant was an idea and he was helping women's basketball. He,

82
00:04:59.111 --> 00:05:02.620
you know, the way he was with his daughter and she wanted to be in the w NBA.

83
00:05:02.621 --> 00:05:04.780
And that's just beautiful. I mean, there's this clip on,

84
00:05:04.781 --> 00:05:09.130
I think it's Jimmy Kimmel talking about how, um, uh,

85
00:05:09.490 --> 00:05:11.830
Kobe was just like, you know,

86
00:05:12.280 --> 00:05:14.650
he was talking about his daughter and they were saying about how like, Oh yeah,

87
00:05:14.680 --> 00:05:16.960
don't you feel bad that you don't have any sons, you know,

88
00:05:16.961 --> 00:05:20.020
you need someone to carry on your legacy and his daughter would cut them off and

89
00:05:20.021 --> 00:05:23.680
be like, Whoa, that's me. I'm the legacy. And then how he was like, yeah,

90
00:05:23.681 --> 00:05:25.090
you're right. You are the legacy.

91
00:05:25.600 --> 00:05:30.280
And that's just so awesome that he had his daughter's back like

92
00:05:30.281 --> 00:05:33.880
that. You know? I mean, look,

93
00:05:33.881 --> 00:05:36.100
it's hard enough for women in, in certain ways.

94
00:05:36.101 --> 00:05:39.970
And just the fact that he was like an out an ally for his daughters and like,

95
00:05:40.900 --> 00:05:44.460
it was just so awesome. And it's, it's,

96
00:05:44.490 --> 00:05:46.120
it's like people need that.

97
00:05:46.300 --> 00:05:50.170
And now that he died in such a weird way,

98
00:05:50.980 --> 00:05:55.650
it's about the idea. It's about the idea that died too. And, but, but,

99
00:05:55.690 --> 00:05:59.750
but here's the thing that I did didn't die because you still have that idea,

100
00:06:00.530 --> 00:06:04.850
you know, it's, it's, it's still lives on he's bigger than the person he was,

101
00:06:04.940 --> 00:06:08.740
which is man. I mean, you know,

102
00:06:08.950 --> 00:06:13.030
it's more than 99.9% of people can say,

103
00:06:14.050 --> 00:06:18.220
and that's a beautiful thing. And it's so tragic the way he died.

104
00:06:18.550 --> 00:06:22.630
And it's so tragic the way his, you know, H how it, how it happened,

105
00:06:22.660 --> 00:06:25.900
but I mean, no blood it's tragic. However,

106
00:06:25.901 --> 00:06:30.130
there is also the idea that lives on and that

107
00:06:30.760 --> 00:06:35.530
is just, it's so special,

108
00:06:35.770 --> 00:06:36.221
man. You know,

109
00:06:36.221 --> 00:06:40.090
I don't get too serious on this podcast too much because we'd like to have a

110
00:06:40.091 --> 00:06:42.430
silly goose time and, you know,

111
00:06:43.240 --> 00:06:47.770
that's my idea that I want to get out there. Uh, but when there's a, you know,

112
00:06:47.771 --> 00:06:52.220
and that's, but there's a real idea behind Kobe, Kobe Bryant. And,

113
00:06:52.460 --> 00:06:57.340
and it's just, you know, it's really touching man, a guy like me for a guy,

114
00:06:57.341 --> 00:07:00.850
like for a guy like me, who doesn't even watch basketball. You know,

115
00:07:00.851 --> 00:07:03.790
there were kids out, there was nine year olds out there that were,

116
00:07:03.820 --> 00:07:08.440
that were like mourning the loss of Kobe Bryant and 50 year olds out there that

117
00:07:08.441 --> 00:07:12.730
were at the staple center that were like, you know, and, and,

118
00:07:13.330 --> 00:07:14.380
and, you know, it's,

119
00:07:14.410 --> 00:07:17.740
it's always a shame when somebody like that dies because they're not able to

120
00:07:17.741 --> 00:07:22.670
witness the love for them. And, and the, and the togetherness that it,

121
00:07:22.671 --> 00:07:25.450
it, it, it, you know, it brings us all together afterwards,

122
00:07:25.451 --> 00:07:28.240
and they're not able to see it. Like even my buddy Brody Stevens, who,

123
00:07:28.570 --> 00:07:31.330
who was a victim of suicide, like he, who, you know,

124
00:07:31.331 --> 00:07:35.890
he killed himself and like to see that guy was always insecure about people

125
00:07:35.891 --> 00:07:38.560
liking him. He thought, well, didn't like him. He thought, you know,

126
00:07:38.561 --> 00:07:41.410
and he was one of the funniest guys I've ever met in my life.

127
00:07:41.710 --> 00:07:43.800
And I would see him all the time at the comedy, sorry.

128
00:07:43.801 --> 00:07:47.020
And he was a friend of mine and he killed herself. And, and,

129
00:07:47.230 --> 00:07:51.100
and just the rallying that the, the people,

130
00:07:52.150 --> 00:07:55.210
the community that the comedians, and then the people outside of,

131
00:07:55.300 --> 00:07:56.400
of people who are comedians,

132
00:07:56.401 --> 00:08:01.000
just fans that just got behind the idea of Brody Stevens.

133
00:08:02.440 --> 00:08:06.040
It's, it's a beautiful thing, the sad but beautiful thing.

134
00:08:06.070 --> 00:08:10.570
And it's also a shame that that person can never see it

135
00:08:12.850 --> 00:08:16.570
because he would have loved to see in it. And, you know, I don't know.

136
00:08:16.630 --> 00:08:19.240
It just may make, makes me think, you know, people say like,

137
00:08:19.241 --> 00:08:21.610
grab your loved ones and let them know you love them. And,

138
00:08:22.140 --> 00:08:25.720
and I suppose that's very important. Uh,

139
00:08:26.050 --> 00:08:31.000
but my heart goes out, man, and that's sucks. And it's just a tragedy.

140
00:08:31.990 --> 00:08:35.890
And hopefully in a few weeks or months, or however, a year, however long,

141
00:08:35.891 --> 00:08:36.730
it takes you to grieve.

142
00:08:36.731 --> 00:08:41.410
Like you can just start celebrating the idea that Kobe Bryant

143
00:08:41.710 --> 00:08:46.660
was. And, um, and that's that, you know, I mean,

144
00:08:46.661 --> 00:08:49.810
I think about Tupac all the time. I know I make jokes about how, you know,

145
00:08:51.160 --> 00:08:55.590
I got, I got this, huh. On a loop here, you know,

146
00:08:55.591 --> 00:08:58.590
and that's not really the idea that Tupac was behind someone's, but.

147
00:08:59.040 --> 00:09:01.230
<v 1>It was the, you know, to.</v>

148
00:09:01.230 --> 00:09:04.950
<v 0>Me, Tupac, it, transcend hip hop, it transcended, uh,</v>

149
00:09:05.670 --> 00:09:07.200
his rap music. Like I.

150
00:09:08.730 --> 00:09:10.950
<v 1>He got me through certain times in.</v>

151
00:09:10.980 --> 00:09:12.750
<v 0>You know, as silly as it is a suburban white kid,</v>

152
00:09:12.751 --> 00:09:15.180
but like high school and college and like that.

153
00:09:15.410 --> 00:09:18.440
<v 1>Now, whenever some goes down in the back of my head a little bit.</v>

154
00:09:22.160 --> 00:09:26.660
<v 0>And it helps, but, uh, you know,</v>

155
00:09:26.661 --> 00:09:28.670
love or whatever, out there to all the,

156
00:09:28.760 --> 00:09:31.250
all the people that are affected by this, God,

157
00:09:31.251 --> 00:09:34.790
I can't believe how many people I've never witnessed something.

158
00:09:34.820 --> 00:09:36.440
Even the Michael Jackson thing. I know it was,

159
00:09:36.470 --> 00:09:38.510
I know Michael Jackson was probably bigger than Kobe,

160
00:09:38.511 --> 00:09:41.600
but I've never seen something like, like this for, for,

161
00:09:41.630 --> 00:09:46.220
for a celebrity that died. Uh, anyway, that's, uh, that's the,

162
00:09:46.730 --> 00:09:51.530
uh, the, the real. And now we'll probably have a syllabus time. I mean,

163
00:09:51.531 --> 00:09:53.660
I'm not, I don't ever promise you anything. It is what it is.

164
00:09:53.661 --> 00:09:56.180
And we fly by the seat of our pants and my babies, and it's all good, but.

165
00:09:58.040 --> 00:10:01.070
<v 1>Uh, it's cool. It's also cool to me that someone can like, like,</v>

166
00:10:01.071 --> 00:10:02.000
LeBron's like this,

167
00:10:02.001 --> 00:10:06.350
like that someone can be so easy.

168
00:10:06.380 --> 00:10:09.350
<v 0>In the spotlight. I mean, [inaudible].</v>

169
00:10:09.710 --> 00:10:12.920
<v 1>And under a microscope and just, I mean, LeBron</v>

170
00:10:14.510 --> 00:10:18.110
just take LeBron, like, dude, where's his scandal.

171
00:10:18.740 --> 00:10:22.130
How is LeBron? Just basically,

172
00:10:23.210 --> 00:10:25.100
you know, Jesus.

173
00:10:25.340 --> 00:10:29.180
<v 0>Like, I don't want to get the Catholics mad even though who cares.</v>

174
00:10:29.750 --> 00:10:34.180
But like, even though who cares, right. Because it doesn't matter. Right.

175
00:10:35.180 --> 00:10:37.400
<v 1>I don't want to off the Catholics, but on one hand,</v>

176
00:10:37.401 --> 00:10:41.420
I don't want to off the Catholics. But on the other hand, who cares, right?

177
00:10:42.440 --> 00:10:46.010
Couldn't care. A rat task in I'm talking about,

178
00:10:46.220 --> 00:10:50.930
so why is LeBron so perfect?

179
00:10:51.920 --> 00:10:53.600
How come nobody's like.

180
00:10:53.660 --> 00:10:56.090
<v 0>Yeah, LeBron got mad and choked.</v>

181
00:10:56.090 --> 00:10:59.330
<v 1>Me like bro, who's that one? Chris Weber was that the guy,</v>

182
00:10:59.600 --> 00:11:02.900
who's the guy that choked the dude, that guy wasn't even LeBron.

183
00:11:02.901 --> 00:11:06.680
And he was like, I'm going to choke someone. How the do you get everything?

184
00:11:06.710 --> 00:11:11.570
LeBron, the guy has got the greatest family. Great.

185
00:11:11.600 --> 00:11:13.520
You know, he's got planes and houses.

186
00:11:14.000 --> 00:11:16.700
He listens to music on Instagram and makes this face.

187
00:11:18.440 --> 00:11:22.640
That's his scandal. That's it, him turning it up on Instagram.

188
00:11:22.641 --> 00:11:27.410
That guy is there a DM out there that can expose him? You know,

189
00:11:28.400 --> 00:11:30.740
the guy's unreal. And just,

190
00:11:32.780 --> 00:11:37.760
but my point is, how does he, like, if someone with him.

191
00:11:38.170 --> 00:11:41.420
<v 0>Ron, I feel like LeBron will be like, nah, that's not worth my time.</v>

192
00:11:42.280 --> 00:11:45.770
I'm bigger than that. I want to be the bigger person, bro.

193
00:11:46.400 --> 00:11:50.330
How do you have everything? And also be the bigger person.

194
00:11:51.230 --> 00:11:54.640
If I had everything, I'm going to be a small person.

195
00:11:55.740 --> 00:12:00.330
<v 1>If I had more than two pools, getting smaller,</v>

196
00:12:01.080 --> 00:12:05.820
dude, I swear to God. If I get a, like,

197
00:12:05.850 --> 00:12:09.210
if I, if you ever see me, if I ever get a plane, if I ever get a plane,

198
00:12:09.300 --> 00:12:12.240
I G for real, someone's going to have to throw me in because

199
00:12:14.330 --> 00:12:17.760
I swear to God, ladder. They'll be like, Oh, look at that. Or that ladder down,

200
00:12:17.761 --> 00:12:19.710
dude, are you kidding me? Pilot hit me up. Just chucked me in there.

201
00:12:19.920 --> 00:12:23.610
Small person. Now, anytime some goes down. I'm petty.

202
00:12:24.930 --> 00:12:29.370
Anytime some goes down. Somebody could be like, you know,

203
00:12:29.970 --> 00:12:31.410
dude, I'm petty now, bro.

204
00:12:31.920 --> 00:12:35.730
I have to force myself to not clap back or these trolls in Twitter, dude.

205
00:12:36.180 --> 00:12:39.240
I have to force myself not to it. When someone talks to me on Twitter,

206
00:12:39.300 --> 00:12:41.880
I have to force myself to turn this down. That pops in my head

207
00:12:45.000 --> 00:12:45.900
when somebody is in my Twitter,

208
00:12:50.850 --> 00:12:52.860
I swear to God. If I get a plane, I'm just

209
00:12:55.770 --> 00:12:59.640
straight up. I'm going to be so small. People are going to be like, where is he?

210
00:13:02.490 --> 00:13:04.980
And I'm going to be in the room.

211
00:13:07.500 --> 00:13:11.040
Swear to God. I'll be in a cupboard somewhere. Just like laundering hard.

212
00:13:12.510 --> 00:13:16.800
I'm Chucky. Swear to God. When I get a plane, I'm Chucky.

213
00:13:16.860 --> 00:13:21.570
I'm getting overalls and a striped shirt and just stabbing that talk to me on

214
00:13:21.870 --> 00:13:26.550
Twitter. Like how, how,

215
00:13:28.320 --> 00:13:32.100
how does it happen? Look at these that lose their minds.

216
00:13:32.101 --> 00:13:35.820
Look at Jared Leto. Hey Jared Leto. We get it.

217
00:13:35.850 --> 00:13:38.970
You have 19 abs uh,

218
00:13:41.520 --> 00:13:46.320
dude, you got abs touching your. We get it. They go all the way down.

219
00:13:48.570 --> 00:13:49.980
We get it. Jared Leto.

220
00:13:50.010 --> 00:13:54.810
You got abs that go from your Adam's Apple all the way down to the base of your

221
00:13:55.350 --> 00:13:56.100
tank.

222
00:13:56.100 --> 00:14:00.630
Also a petty because you got a

223
00:14:00.631 --> 00:14:04.650
plane. When you get a plane, how do you not lose your mind?

224
00:14:04.800 --> 00:14:07.920
LeBron? He's like, nah, nah. It's all good.

225
00:14:09.870 --> 00:14:13.410
I'm an idea. That's amazing, dude.

226
00:14:13.860 --> 00:14:14.880
I swear to God.

227
00:14:17.970 --> 00:14:21.270
I just don't understand how you can do that. I mean,

228
00:14:21.271 --> 00:14:24.960
I know people that are coming up now that are in the head and they're not even

229
00:14:24.961 --> 00:14:28.830
barely famous. They got tickets to sell.

230
00:14:29.970 --> 00:14:33.270
They got tickets left to sell and they're like,

231
00:14:36.030 --> 00:14:39.090
I was with a buddy and I'm not even going to name them because he's a buddy,

232
00:14:39.780 --> 00:14:44.130
but he snapped at another at a fan dude. And I was like, Whoa, bro,

233
00:14:45.600 --> 00:14:48.000
what about becoming an I day? Yeah,

234
00:14:49.950 --> 00:14:51.920
you don't even have a yet.

235
00:14:52.880 --> 00:14:55.250
And this guy's like some fan came up, Hey,

236
00:14:55.370 --> 00:14:57.710
when are you going to be on Rogan again? And the guy goes, the guy says,

237
00:14:57.770 --> 00:14:58.970
I don't know

238
00:15:01.250 --> 00:15:03.440
what about LeBron, dude?

239
00:15:05.330 --> 00:15:05.510
<v 2>You.</v>

240
00:15:05.510 --> 00:15:08.690
<v 1>Don't even have a pool that you don't share with someone.</v>

241
00:15:09.290 --> 00:15:13.580
You got a pool that you share with some families because in a

242
00:15:13.581 --> 00:15:17.990
complex and it's fine, but don't snap.

243
00:15:18.410 --> 00:15:19.460
What about being.

244
00:15:20.260 --> 00:15:21.093
<v 2>Ron?</v>

245
00:15:23.050 --> 00:15:26.650
<v 1>I know some of these guys coming up, dude, and they're just petty dude.</v>

246
00:15:28.120 --> 00:15:31.210
And I, you know, I try to keep a check on that, man.

247
00:15:31.660 --> 00:15:34.120
But like I'm not even talking about petty. I'm talking about like.

248
00:15:35.500 --> 00:15:38.650
I know some comedians, man. And they're just jealous bro. And it's like,

249
00:15:38.651 --> 00:15:41.290
why we're all in this together.

250
00:15:41.590 --> 00:15:46.480
The second a person gets bigger. That's in standup.

251
00:15:46.870 --> 00:15:51.400
The second they get bigger, it's better for me. Why don't you realize that

252
00:15:53.110 --> 00:15:57.880
the more it's better for all of us, the more it's better for all of them.

253
00:15:58.270 --> 00:15:59.103
<v 2>Gosh.</v>

254
00:16:00.880 --> 00:16:04.420
<v 1>If you go on a tour with somebody, you know, uh,</v>

255
00:16:04.480 --> 00:16:07.480
if I was going to go on a tour with Bobby Lee or whatever the and we were just

256
00:16:08.650 --> 00:16:09.071
now, you know what?

257
00:16:09.071 --> 00:16:11.260
I don't want to work with that guy because this happened in that habit,

258
00:16:11.680 --> 00:16:11.861
Bobby he's like,

259
00:16:11.861 --> 00:16:14.950
I don't want to work with that guy because his lips are always wet and he looks

260
00:16:14.951 --> 00:16:18.070
like a bird. And I say to Bobby, I don't want to work with Bobby anymore.

261
00:16:18.220 --> 00:16:21.130
Cause he's literally a cartoon. And he's 50, even though he's 12

262
00:16:22.960 --> 00:16:25.780
and now we talk and then we don't go on tour together. Guess what?

263
00:16:26.050 --> 00:16:30.790
We lose out on each other's fans and it's not as good for each

264
00:16:30.791 --> 00:16:34.510
other. I mean, I got one buddy. That's just trying to, that.

265
00:16:34.511 --> 00:16:36.250
Just thinks everyone's out to get him, dude.

266
00:16:36.670 --> 00:16:38.200
I'm not going to tell you if he's an actor or a comedian,

267
00:16:38.201 --> 00:16:41.110
but he thinks that everybody is out to get him dude.

268
00:16:41.620 --> 00:16:45.640
And he's it up for himself. And I want to talk to the dude,

269
00:16:45.641 --> 00:16:49.030
but he's so hard to talk to. And I know that if we talk to it,

270
00:16:49.240 --> 00:16:51.700
if we talk to each other, he's going to get defensive

271
00:16:54.400 --> 00:16:58.780
and he's it up for himself, dude. Cause he's about to have it all.

272
00:16:59.290 --> 00:17:02.200
And I just want to be like, what about planes dude?

273
00:17:05.680 --> 00:17:07.930
And quite frankly, that's the T

274
00:17:10.150 --> 00:17:13.870
quite frankly, that's the T and I don't say that kind of.

275
00:17:14.560 --> 00:17:18.940
Cause you pretty much have to be like either a woman or gay to say that's the T,

276
00:17:19.120 --> 00:17:23.140
but I'll say it as a heterosexual male. That's the tea.

277
00:17:27.340 --> 00:17:31.180
So I don't know. I don't know, man. It's just,

278
00:17:31.240 --> 00:17:34.930
how are you not rooting for people? How are you not rooting for people?

279
00:17:35.680 --> 00:17:39.760
How are you not out there rooting for people? How do you let this?

280
00:17:40.540 --> 00:17:45.370
And I'm petty, but I'm petty to a point. If somebody talks, I talk. I told you

281
00:17:48.100 --> 00:17:51.570
and I'm very in, but dude,

282
00:17:53.070 --> 00:17:57.570
that's where it stops. How are you not rooting for people, man?

283
00:17:57.840 --> 00:18:01.140
They're people that when they do well, if everyone's doing well,

284
00:18:01.141 --> 00:18:04.530
everyone's doing well. How is that something so hard to understand.

285
00:18:11.270 --> 00:18:15.680
<v 0>Especially in the same business dude peeler. So jealous man. And you know,</v>

286
00:18:15.681 --> 00:18:18.470
I guess I get that way sometimes, but I try to think about it.

287
00:18:18.471 --> 00:18:20.990
And I came from a good family. So like I had a leg up, you know,

288
00:18:21.260 --> 00:18:22.093
my parents taught,

289
00:18:22.190 --> 00:18:25.550
taught me well and not everybody has taught has had good parents and not

290
00:18:25.551 --> 00:18:27.980
everybody has had a life of privilege. Okay.

291
00:18:28.190 --> 00:18:32.150
<v 1>But still dude, there's people out there that were straight up by their uncle,</v>

292
00:18:32.151 --> 00:18:32.630
that.

293
00:18:32.630 --> 00:18:34.910
<v 0>Businesses and our good ideas.</v>

294
00:18:35.720 --> 00:18:36.553
<v 1>You know?</v>

295
00:18:38.000 --> 00:18:40.250
<v 0>So at the end of the day, um,</v>

296
00:18:41.570 --> 00:18:45.290
a rising tide lifts all boats. And I don't know really what that means,

297
00:18:45.680 --> 00:18:48.590
but one fire wrote it and it's true.

298
00:18:49.670 --> 00:18:53.060
And I do know what it means. A rising tide lifts all boats. That's the truth,

299
00:18:53.061 --> 00:18:57.290
a rising tide, one fire that's the one thing he typed on the thing today.

300
00:18:57.291 --> 00:19:01.040
For some reason he thinks he's God Confucius and it's fine, dude,

301
00:19:01.910 --> 00:19:04.160
but it's true. A rising tide lifts all boats, dude.

302
00:19:04.610 --> 00:19:06.170
So get in the boat here it comes.

303
00:19:08.540 --> 00:19:09.620
<v 1>I'm just going to have temperature.</v>
