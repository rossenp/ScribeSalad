00:00:00.600 --> 00:00:03.180
<v 0>There was a, you know,</v>

2
00:00:03.181 --> 00:00:07.290
what's so ridiculous is all these commercials now that are socially conscious.

3
00:00:08.250 --> 00:00:09.630
It's like, it's like, dude,

4
00:00:10.020 --> 00:00:13.140
just cause we're going through COVID you don't have to make a

5
00:00:14.190 --> 00:00:18.990
commercial about how socially distancing is important.

6
00:00:19.160 --> 00:00:22.970
Okay. Is Zuzu like, dude,

7
00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:25.820
make a car just because,

8
00:00:26.420 --> 00:00:31.010
just because you're practicing social distancing doesn't mean you can't remain

9
00:00:31.011 --> 00:00:35.600
connected, make a car. There was a row.

10
00:00:35.630 --> 00:00:40.400
I don't remember if it was like a Acura or some infinity. I think it was do it.

11
00:00:40.700 --> 00:00:44.750
What? What's a infinity anyway. Like there's too many of them.

12
00:00:44.870 --> 00:00:48.260
I don't know one person with one and I would never know somebody with an

13
00:00:48.710 --> 00:00:51.980
infinity ever in my life. If my friend had an infinity, I go like this. Oh,

14
00:00:52.010 --> 00:00:54.230
I thought I knew you. But dude

15
00:00:55.880 --> 00:00:59.270
also infinity picks like the weird numbers and letters and. It's like a Q 35.

16
00:00:59.271 --> 00:01:02.480
It's like, dude, what, what am I, James Bond? It's a,

17
00:01:03.800 --> 00:01:06.530
[inaudible] a [inaudible] you do what Audi does.

18
00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:10.550
It's like Q Audi has a queue. As a matter of fact,

19
00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:16.070
whatever. Don't listen to me. But my point is the, I think it was infinity.

20
00:01:16.071 --> 00:01:17.930
And it was like in times,

21
00:01:17.931 --> 00:01:22.610
like the dude don't every commercial in times.

22
00:01:22.611 --> 00:01:25.760
Like these with the time like this, with that,

23
00:01:26.180 --> 00:01:31.010
where cubes staying connected is more important than ever. Oh yeah. Okay.

24
00:01:31.040 --> 00:01:33.620
Velveeta. It's a put it in my mouth.

25
00:01:34.910 --> 00:01:36.140
It's so ridiculous.

26
00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:40.670
It's important with times any time a product is telling me how important the

27
00:01:40.671 --> 00:01:43.760
time is. I'm out. I'm out, man.

28
00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:49.070
Make the product commercial suck. Hire me. I'll be like, Hey,

29
00:01:49.071 --> 00:01:53.270
you want these pants? Get these pants. These pants are the best pants.

30
00:01:53.930 --> 00:01:54.763
I'll Trump it up.

31
00:02:00.350 --> 00:02:03.320
Yeah. Do it. Socially-conscious commercials are the worst. You you're just,

32
00:02:03.350 --> 00:02:05.210
you're trying to, you're a commercial.

33
00:02:05.270 --> 00:02:06.980
You're trying to get us to buy your product.

34
00:02:07.250 --> 00:02:11.630
Why are you being socially conscious? What was the ad?

35
00:02:11.631 --> 00:02:15.080
Where the really one where people were like,

36
00:02:15.230 --> 00:02:18.890
I think it was a shaving one where they were like a shaver one where they were

37
00:02:18.891 --> 00:02:22.940
like, it was some like you don't need to be. Um, it was so ridiculous.

38
00:02:22.941 --> 00:02:26.450
It was like, you don't need to be a man to shave your beard. I was like,

39
00:02:26.810 --> 00:02:30.440
all right, dude. It was like, I can't remember what it was,

40
00:02:30.441 --> 00:02:34.520
but it was so pandering. The second I could smell the agenda I'm out.

41
00:02:35.900 --> 00:02:37.520
I don't like to smell the agenda.

42
00:02:41.390 --> 00:02:43.100
I can't smell the agenda. Dude.

43
00:02:45.830 --> 00:02:49.670
During times like these it's more important then ever.

44
00:02:49.760 --> 00:02:53.450
How many commercials have started that, that way during times,

45
00:02:53.451 --> 00:02:57.860
like these it's more important than ever to visit living

46
00:02:57.861 --> 00:03:02.230
spaces. Do you need end tables?

47
00:03:03.430 --> 00:03:07.990
Well, remember we're here for you during times.

48
00:03:07.991 --> 00:03:11.590
Like these comfortability is more important than ever.

49
00:03:11.740 --> 00:03:13.750
We know a lot's going on in the world.

50
00:03:14.890 --> 00:03:19.630
So here at radio shack, come get a VCR.

51
00:03:20.440 --> 00:03:24.970
Hey, radio shack. How do we still exist?

52
00:03:26.490 --> 00:03:29.610
My buddy Dean Del Ray has the funniest bit about radio shack.

53
00:03:31.380 --> 00:03:33.480
I don't remember it, buddy. You'd be like, why is it,

54
00:03:34.800 --> 00:03:39.660
how is there still a radio shack? Um,

55
00:03:41.010 --> 00:03:45.900
anyway, Hey, come on,

56
00:03:47.850 --> 00:03:51.480
come on guys by this. But during times,

57
00:03:51.481 --> 00:03:56.010
like these were more here for you than any place. Home Depot.

58
00:03:56.100 --> 00:03:59.430
They'll do it with home Depot. Like they give a, dude,

59
00:04:02.940 --> 00:04:06.270
you need wood. During times like these,

60
00:04:06.271 --> 00:04:10.830
we understand the structure of society, maybe collapsing,

61
00:04:11.340 --> 00:04:15.570
but we're not home Depot

62
00:04:18.150 --> 00:04:22.620
during times like days we know it's going to be awful and you might get

63
00:04:22.621 --> 00:04:26.970
COVID hookers were here for you

64
00:04:28.410 --> 00:04:33.270
when you thought life sucked. We're here to suck it back. Oh,

65
00:04:33.750 --> 00:04:36.450
curse. Slobbing on your knob.

66
00:04:40.590 --> 00:04:45.420
Aye. Hookers one, the oldest profession in the world,

67
00:04:47.100 --> 00:04:51.690
way older than COVID hookers. Wash your hands also hookers.

68
00:04:54.510 --> 00:04:57.810
Just, just because it's harder to stay connected in the real world.

69
00:04:58.380 --> 00:04:59.040
Doesn't mean it's hard.

70
00:04:59.040 --> 00:05:03.780
It should be hard to connect your into a hookers or a or a mouth

71
00:05:03.990 --> 00:05:04.950
hookers.

72
00:05:07.770 --> 00:05:11.310
We want you to feel sensation. Oh. That was so loud.

73
00:05:13.230 --> 00:05:15.450
Um, in my, in my headphones anyway,
