Only the biggest dramas on trending Tuesdays. That's how we roll. Now.

6
00:00:20.340 --> 00:00:24.900
We're a drama channel, uh, basically. So right off to get into it,

7
00:00:24.901 --> 00:00:28.920
let's go to the big boy desk. Come on. Let's go. Come with me.

8
00:00:29.370 --> 00:00:29.911
There we go.

9
00:00:29.911 --> 00:00:34.410
Look at that high level production paid way too much money for this. What big,

10
00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:38.450
big drama are we talking about today? Well, uh,

11
00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:43.380
I've got a few topics for you guys. One big drama. Look at this guy.

12
00:00:43.830 --> 00:00:44.663
Quitting YouTube.

13
00:00:45.860 --> 00:00:47.420
<v 1>This might be the last time I was saying this.</v>

14
00:00:48.020 --> 00:00:52.280
<v 0>Oh yeah, you got to have the sad piano. Good job, man. Following the template.</v>

15
00:00:54.410 --> 00:00:56.150
<v 1>Until next time.</v>

16
00:00:58.520 --> 00:01:02.030
<v 0>Goodbye. It says thanks for the 15 years. Goodbye.</v>

17
00:01:02.330 --> 00:01:06.230
Of course it's trending as usual, 3 million views, whatever.

18
00:01:07.120 --> 00:01:10.160
He's so sad. He's so you know, he he's leaving forever.

19
00:01:10.161 --> 00:01:12.230
He says this might be the last time he says it.

20
00:01:16.790 --> 00:01:19.850
<v 1>Oh my God. You're not smiling.</v>

21
00:01:21.890 --> 00:01:22.723
You're doing it wrong.

22
00:01:31.730 --> 00:01:31.910
[inaudible].

23
00:01:31.910 --> 00:01:35.630
<v 0>You're crying. You're not doing it right then. You're doing.</v>

24
00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:42.673
<v 1>[Inaudible].</v>

25
00:01:46.130 --> 00:01:50.270
<v 0>Safe. Be happy. I'll see you in 2021. Probably.</v>

26
00:01:50.870 --> 00:01:54.350
I thought this was a goodbye video. I thought, what is this?

27
00:01:55.310 --> 00:01:57.110
<v 1>All right, I'm gonna take the thumbnail.</v>

28
00:02:00.530 --> 00:02:03.170
<v 0>Why does he have this in the video? Hey guys,</v>

29
00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:04.670
I'm going to manipulate my audience.

30
00:02:04.671 --> 00:02:07.220
I got to take a thumbnail real quick and me crying. Hold on, hold on.

31
00:02:07.430 --> 00:02:12.320
Got to get that light, right? Oh, I can't believe it.

32
00:02:12.410 --> 00:02:13.640
Goodbye guys.

33
00:02:14.060 --> 00:02:17.750
Alex was Savi Slate's month long YouTube hiatus guys.

34
00:02:18.770 --> 00:02:21.560
YouTube is going on vacation. Isn't news. I mean,

35
00:02:21.561 --> 00:02:25.220
I think we should be allowed to go on vacation, but you don't need to cry.

36
00:02:25.520 --> 00:02:29.690
Imagine if you at your job every time before, before you left for vacation,

37
00:02:30.020 --> 00:02:33.650
you go into your office. You go boss. This might be the last time I see you.

38
00:02:35.540 --> 00:02:39.320
I mean, if you're not smiling, you're not doing it right. I can't even,

39
00:02:39.380 --> 00:02:42.110
I can't even pretend. Imagine how stupid that would be.

40
00:02:42.111 --> 00:02:44.600
This is what you tubers do. I don't know.

41
00:02:44.610 --> 00:02:49.580
I'm saying anyone who fakes a goodbye from the internet deserves jail

42
00:02:49.850 --> 00:02:54.710
title. Just going to say that right now. Okay. Anyways. Now next drama.

43
00:02:55.040 --> 00:02:58.580
Oh, hello bet. You didn't expect to see me here at look I'm from the future.

44
00:02:59.530 --> 00:03:02.920
I'm not even in uniform right now because a guys, unfortunately,

45
00:03:03.220 --> 00:03:06.190
a big drama happened last night that we have to throw into the story.

46
00:03:06.460 --> 00:03:09.160
Cut in the mix. So apologize if this doesn't flow perfectly,

47
00:03:09.161 --> 00:03:14.050
but we got to talk about call me Carson, Twitter lost its mind. Last night,

48
00:03:14.110 --> 00:03:16.570
when allegations came out that a,

49
00:03:16.571 --> 00:03:19.750
this popular YouTuber with like 5 million subscribers, uh,

50
00:03:19.780 --> 00:03:24.580
groomed a 17 year old. Now everybody of course lost their minds. I said, Oh,

51
00:03:24.581 --> 00:03:25.450
this is terrible. It's terrible.

52
00:03:25.870 --> 00:03:29.140
Until he came out that he was 19 when it happened.

53
00:03:29.141 --> 00:03:33.580
So he was 19 years old talking to a 17 year old. And of course, as you know,

54
00:03:33.581 --> 00:03:37.600
from the internet, uh, they're very good at having very rational,

55
00:03:38.620 --> 00:03:41.050
uh, nuanced discussions about matters.

56
00:03:41.520 --> 00:03:42.353
<v 1>Uh, the law</v>

57
00:03:47.520 --> 00:03:47.880
[inaudible].

58
00:03:47.880 --> 00:03:51.000
<v 0>Yeah. So anyway, a very nuanced, balanced discussion was had.</v>

59
00:03:51.180 --> 00:03:54.360
And of course the hot takes from the internet had to come out. Uh, before,

60
00:03:54.780 --> 00:03:58.320
before we had even heard anybody else's side of the story, call me Carson,

61
00:03:58.350 --> 00:04:02.160
maybe a pedo allegations. Call me Carson allegations,

62
00:04:02.220 --> 00:04:06.480
a neutral take drama alert. Call me Carson Cabi. Carson is not a pedo.

63
00:04:07.050 --> 00:04:10.530
Call me. Carson is allegedly a pedal Callie. Carson is definitely a pedo.

64
00:04:10.800 --> 00:04:11.820
Call me, Carson is a.

65
00:04:12.270 --> 00:04:13.103
<v 1>Hello.</v>

66
00:04:15.230 --> 00:04:17.700
<v 0>I wanted to talk about this real quick because it's a big drama.</v>

67
00:04:17.850 --> 00:04:19.260
Not that I really care.

68
00:04:19.470 --> 00:04:22.830
Cause I think a lot of this is overblown and kind of dumb.

69
00:04:22.980 --> 00:04:27.690
There's a bit of a wrinkle because of course he sent pictures back and

70
00:04:27.691 --> 00:04:32.190
forth with this minor. Uh, so let's talk about that real quick. Okay.

71
00:04:32.220 --> 00:04:36.930
Number one, a 19 year old talking to a 17 year old is not big news guys.

72
00:04:36.990 --> 00:04:41.490
When you talk about these things, the difference in age matters guys,

73
00:04:41.940 --> 00:04:46.290
back in my day, all right. I'm to, I'm an old boomer now married up,

74
00:04:46.320 --> 00:04:48.990
locked it up. But I was dating my high school sweetheart,

75
00:04:49.020 --> 00:04:53.280
who eventually became my wife. And uh, yeah, she's six months older than me.

76
00:04:53.400 --> 00:04:56.730
We weren't, we didn't happen to be born on the same day. So there was a time,

77
00:04:58.590 --> 00:05:01.200
uh, where we could have exposed her guys. We missed our opportunity,

78
00:05:02.010 --> 00:05:05.520
but where she was 18 and I was still a minor and guys, guess what?

79
00:05:05.521 --> 00:05:08.340
We were still talking. Does that make her a groomer?

80
00:05:08.490 --> 00:05:13.230
Does that make her a Pat out? No dude, no.

81
00:05:13.530 --> 00:05:16.050
The only reason anyone's being a big deal out of it is because this guy is

82
00:05:16.051 --> 00:05:19.650
internet famous. So I'm going to go ahead and say, that is off the table.

83
00:05:19.651 --> 00:05:23.580
That doesn't matter. Then you have this thing of like sending, you know, picks.

84
00:05:24.030 --> 00:05:27.630
Okay. Now obviously I can't relate because me and my wife, we didn't even, uh,

85
00:05:27.690 --> 00:05:31.260
hold hands until we got married. But you know,

86
00:05:31.261 --> 00:05:35.010
for the rest of you heathens out there, I know some of you are tempted. Okay.

87
00:05:35.520 --> 00:05:40.110
Yeah. You go ahead and sin, sin the snaps. So what do we do about that?

88
00:05:40.230 --> 00:05:43.890
All right, look, it's my opinion. I know this is going to sound crazy,

89
00:05:44.010 --> 00:05:47.820
but if you're going to go out and say that it's not a big deal,

90
00:05:47.821 --> 00:05:50.790
if a 19 year old has sex with a 17 year old,

91
00:05:51.330 --> 00:05:54.540
then is it a big deal that they exchanged pictures? Um,

92
00:05:54.870 --> 00:05:58.460
I think that's kind of a weird thing. Look,

93
00:05:58.490 --> 00:06:01.760
I know all of you guys are lawyers and I know all of your cops and you perfectly

94
00:06:01.761 --> 00:06:03.110
understand the, you know,

95
00:06:03.260 --> 00:06:06.020
the balance between age of consent and Romeo and Juliet laws,

96
00:06:06.021 --> 00:06:07.970
which say that the age gap matters.

97
00:06:08.150 --> 00:06:11.390
And I know you guys understand where Carson lives and all that kind of stuff.

98
00:06:11.420 --> 00:06:15.470
I don't care. That's not what I'm into. I'm into like, do we really care?

99
00:06:15.500 --> 00:06:20.240
Do I care that a 19 year old was sharing pictures with a 17 year old and vice

100
00:06:20.241 --> 00:06:24.880
versa? No, no. It happens literally every day. And probably most of you,

101
00:06:24.970 --> 00:06:26.650
the guys who are like throwing stones and saying, Oh,

102
00:06:26.651 --> 00:06:29.890
this guy's evil have probably done it too. You were 18.

103
00:06:30.190 --> 00:06:33.850
And the girl was 17 or vice versa, which happens also all the time.

104
00:06:33.880 --> 00:06:38.380
So the only thing left in this drama is that Carson is an internet service

105
00:06:38.790 --> 00:06:41.920
guys. Now I would know a little thing or two about being an internet celeb.

106
00:06:41.940 --> 00:06:46.480
So let me tell you, this is where my boy messed up. Okay.

107
00:06:46.481 --> 00:06:50.020
And this is honestly why I don't talk to any of you. I have a role,

108
00:06:50.050 --> 00:06:51.700
never talk to your fans ever.

109
00:06:51.730 --> 00:06:54.580
Don't engage just if they come up to you on the street, say, Hey, Steven,

110
00:06:54.581 --> 00:06:57.790
I want to know now. And it's just,

111
00:06:57.791 --> 00:07:01.810
you don't do it because there is that weird power dynamic thing that everyone's

112
00:07:01.811 --> 00:07:06.040
been talking about lately. I do think that that is a real thing. It exists,

113
00:07:06.070 --> 00:07:09.160
even though it sounds like a book written by L Ron Hubbard. Yeah.

114
00:07:09.190 --> 00:07:10.900
Power dynamics between fans.

115
00:07:10.960 --> 00:07:15.730
And they're like a object of worship. They're celebrity.

116
00:07:15.760 --> 00:07:19.810
I know we're just in a celebrity obsessed culture now. So, you know, that's,

117
00:07:19.870 --> 00:07:23.380
that's real. And so I think that that was a mistake,

118
00:07:23.620 --> 00:07:28.090
but I also think he was 19 years old. Like, I don't think that's giving,

119
00:07:28.120 --> 00:07:29.620
getting its proper attention here.

120
00:07:30.220 --> 00:07:33.790
The dude was 19 when I was 19,

121
00:07:33.850 --> 00:07:36.880
I was dumb as a box of rocks. If I was judged on that forever,

122
00:07:36.881 --> 00:07:39.700
like people are trying to say like lock them up, you know, lock them up.

123
00:07:40.180 --> 00:07:45.100
Oh the cops are coming. Carsten going to be locked up. No, it's like, dude,

124
00:07:45.760 --> 00:07:50.470
this guy he's young, uh, he's figuring out life. Like, should he have done it?

125
00:07:50.471 --> 00:07:51.304
No, of course not.

126
00:07:51.340 --> 00:07:54.220
But people are acting like he was some puppet master people are gone.

127
00:07:54.221 --> 00:07:57.430
He groomed her. He was like a puppet master grow me.

128
00:07:57.880 --> 00:08:01.150
You know like you're talking about some 31 year old talking to a 15 year old.

129
00:08:01.151 --> 00:08:03.340
No dude, this is some awkward.

130
00:08:03.370 --> 00:08:06.280
And you can read the chat log because of course they've been leaked.

131
00:08:06.400 --> 00:08:11.380
This guy is some awkward cringy guy who doesn't know how to handle, you know,

132
00:08:11.381 --> 00:08:14.200
relationships with women. And you can tell,

133
00:08:14.500 --> 00:08:19.150
I don't think this is some massive puppeteer of fans. Uh,

134
00:08:19.151 --> 00:08:21.610
I think it was a mistake. I don't think he should have done it.

135
00:08:21.611 --> 00:08:23.260
I think he should in the future,

136
00:08:23.261 --> 00:08:26.230
better understand his relationship with his fans.

137
00:08:26.950 --> 00:08:29.590
But is this a he's he's this is a big drama.

138
00:08:29.860 --> 00:08:33.490
I'm honestly disappointed with drama. Tuesdays are trending Tuesdays right now,

139
00:08:33.491 --> 00:08:36.730
because feel like, is this really what everyone's freaking out about?

140
00:08:36.820 --> 00:08:39.130
I don't know. I don't get it. Maybe I'm missing something.

141
00:08:39.170 --> 00:08:43.870
Maybe you think that I haven't understood the complexities of the law here.

142
00:08:43.871 --> 00:08:45.340
And since you guys are lawyers,

143
00:08:45.370 --> 00:08:47.380
I want you to explain it to me in the comments below.

144
00:08:47.440 --> 00:08:50.800
Explain to me where I'm wrong. Cause of course, uh,

145
00:08:50.860 --> 00:08:54.910
the Minecraft community has been known for its nuance and

146
00:08:55.530 --> 00:08:59.550
takes so, uh, yeah. I,

147
00:09:00.270 --> 00:09:05.220
whatever next drama dream. The Minecraft YouTuber.

148
00:09:05.250 --> 00:09:07.560
Oh yes. We're getting deep inside of this.

149
00:09:07.561 --> 00:09:12.180
I found a secret never before released video. I really want to talk about guys.

150
00:09:12.330 --> 00:09:14.190
Cause I really care about Minecraft speed running.

151
00:09:14.191 --> 00:09:16.560
I may never have played the game. May never followed any of it,

152
00:09:16.561 --> 00:09:20.310
but I deeply care. Okay. So let's check this out together.

153
00:09:20.690 --> 00:09:25.340
<v 2>Here we go. You don't know me. I wonder what is this? You just own me.</v>

154
00:09:25.970 --> 00:09:29.060
Cool. I don't need your assistance. Social persistence. Any problem I got,

155
00:09:29.070 --> 00:09:33.140
I just put my fist in by like silence, but by this is like pieces.

156
00:09:33.690 --> 00:09:35.270
<v 0>I got him in play, dude.</v>

157
00:09:35.300 --> 00:09:38.660
I can't even get through two topics on trending Tuesdays before I want to go

158
00:09:38.661 --> 00:09:40.070
back to what I want to talk about.

159
00:09:42.600 --> 00:09:45.380
What I want to talk about, uh, is this guy,

160
00:09:48.170 --> 00:09:51.410
that's what I want to talk about guys. We haven't talked about it. Locked up.

161
00:09:51.620 --> 00:09:54.650
Look, I started the London real saga because I was just fascinated,

162
00:09:55.010 --> 00:09:56.390
fascinated by what was going on.

163
00:09:56.391 --> 00:09:59.270
But I feel like I've left a lot of you hanging and mostly it's just cause I've

164
00:09:59.271 --> 00:10:02.870
just, I've wanted to just let the grift be the grift,

165
00:10:03.290 --> 00:10:06.470
but lately he's done some things that I just, we have to talk about.

166
00:10:06.530 --> 00:10:10.040
I'm sorry guys. No Minecraft, maybe Minecraft next trending Tuesdays guys.

167
00:10:10.041 --> 00:10:12.830
Maybe we'll talk about the big, big drama in the Minecraft community.

168
00:10:13.310 --> 00:10:16.880
Cause I know you guys care about that, but today we got to address this man.

169
00:10:17.690 --> 00:10:21.350
<v 2>What have you left me? What have I got last night? The brother got shot.</v>

170
00:10:21.530 --> 00:10:25.490
My homeboy got Jack is on crack, but just to camp work. Cause I'm show tracks,

171
00:10:26.060 --> 00:10:29.480
madness, insanity, and profanity. Then some punk layman. They understand.

172
00:10:29.930 --> 00:10:33.310
Give me a break. What world you live in? Death is my second guest.

173
00:10:33.311 --> 00:10:35.450
My religion colors.

174
00:10:41.180 --> 00:10:45.260
<v 0>Oh my gosh. Okay. We've got to give credit to the guy who made that.</v>

175
00:10:45.261 --> 00:10:49.130
First of all, thank you for doing that. That was beautiful. Joe Whitaker.

176
00:10:49.280 --> 00:10:53.870
He did this. Oh my gosh. So funny, my guy that is amazing. Uh,

177
00:10:54.110 --> 00:10:57.140
guys, if you don't know Brian Rhodes, he's running for mayor and you know,

178
00:10:57.141 --> 00:10:59.540
I haven't been talking about it cause I don't want to call attention to it.

179
00:10:59.690 --> 00:11:03.470
Look really no one's covered this guy. You look up Brian Rose for mayor.

180
00:11:03.680 --> 00:11:06.260
The only thing talking about Brian Rose for mayor is Brian Rose,

181
00:11:06.470 --> 00:11:10.760
but he's been recently making some bold claims, real bold guys.

182
00:11:10.790 --> 00:11:12.980
He says he's winning the election.

183
00:11:14.810 --> 00:11:15.081
<v 2>Hey,</v>

184
00:11:15.081 --> 00:11:19.820
I just wanted to check in with everyone and let you know that we are

185
00:11:19.910 --> 00:11:24.290
winning. Please tell me this isn't real. And on May 7th,

186
00:11:24.320 --> 00:11:28.520
we plan to move into city hall and become your next mayor for London.

187
00:11:28.790 --> 00:11:31.880
At this point, there are only two people in this race,

188
00:11:32.210 --> 00:11:35.420
the current mayor of London, the incumbents and us.

189
00:11:37.100 --> 00:11:39.350
<v 0>Is that true? Is that real?</v>

190
00:11:39.560 --> 00:11:43.850
I'm sure many of you like me are getting triggered right now.

191
00:11:44.240 --> 00:11:46.400
Is it true that Brian Rose,

192
00:11:46.580 --> 00:11:49.760
his digital freedom platform is becoming the official internet of London.

193
00:11:50.030 --> 00:11:50.863
I don't know.

194
00:11:50.990 --> 00:11:55.660
<v 2>And we are soon to be actually moving into first place.</v>

195
00:11:55.690 --> 00:11:59.500
Check the odds, check the bookies out there every day,

196
00:11:59.950 --> 00:12:03.280
we become more and more likely to become your next mayor of London.

197
00:12:03.750 --> 00:12:07.710
<v 0>So okay. You get the point guys. We don't have to play any more that clip.</v>

198
00:12:08.010 --> 00:12:12.210
He says, check the eyes, check the Buc-ee's word. Number two guys.

199
00:12:12.211 --> 00:12:14.010
And we're about to, we're about to move into number one.

200
00:12:14.100 --> 00:12:17.640
We're in fact we're about to move in the first place and move in when the whole

201
00:12:17.641 --> 00:12:18.150
thing.

202
00:12:18.150 --> 00:12:22.650
So my thought was this needs some investigation and there's only one man to do

203
00:12:22.651 --> 00:12:27.570
it. It's me, the internet detective. So I dug into it.

204
00:12:27.600 --> 00:12:32.250
I dug into his policies. I wanted you to know, listen, Hey, worst case scenario.

205
00:12:32.251 --> 00:12:36.960
What happens if the megalomaniac goes and he becomes the mayor of London,

206
00:12:36.961 --> 00:12:39.510
right? Well, after some long research,

207
00:12:39.630 --> 00:12:43.920
I discovered his policy platform transform London, 20,

208
00:12:43.921 --> 00:12:47.940
21. Sorry, Brian. I'm in your way here,

209
00:12:48.330 --> 00:12:51.810
but his vision for London. So I decided we'd go through it together.

210
00:12:51.960 --> 00:12:55.350
Cause I think it's very interesting what he's got going on guys.

211
00:12:55.440 --> 00:12:57.330
I think you should be very worried if I were you.

212
00:12:57.840 --> 00:13:00.990
The following is my transform line in 2021 plan of attack.

213
00:13:01.020 --> 00:13:01.853
Now I'm going to be honest.

214
00:13:01.890 --> 00:13:05.580
The policies were so vague that I did have to interpret them a little bit.

215
00:13:06.060 --> 00:13:08.580
I had it because it was just a bunch of boilerplate stuff.

216
00:13:08.581 --> 00:13:09.480
I didn't understand it. So I,

217
00:13:09.520 --> 00:13:13.620
so I did hire some experts to try to figure out what Brian actually means. Okay?

218
00:13:13.621 --> 00:13:16.860
So he says, he's going to get London back to work. How's he going to do that?

219
00:13:16.950 --> 00:13:17.101
Well,

220
00:13:17.101 --> 00:13:20.790
he's going to reinvigorate the economy of this great city by forcing everyone to

221
00:13:20.791 --> 00:13:23.730
start a podcast and asking them to take Brian Rose's business course,

222
00:13:24.300 --> 00:13:26.940
50% of all profits will be donated to the freedom platform.

223
00:13:27.270 --> 00:13:29.850
So if you're the podcast he gave, this is good news for you.

224
00:13:29.880 --> 00:13:32.160
You should vote for Brian health. First,

225
00:13:32.280 --> 00:13:35.070
we will create the most resilient citizens in the world who are physically and

226
00:13:35.071 --> 00:13:36.690
mentally robust, always prepared for times of crisis.

227
00:13:36.691 --> 00:13:40.680
We will do this by asking them to drink their own urine on a daily basis.

228
00:13:42.150 --> 00:13:46.300
Yeah, that's right guys. I mean, I mean, Brian Rose understands health on a,

229
00:13:46.530 --> 00:13:50.550
you know, psychological level, mental level, spiritual level.

230
00:13:50.910 --> 00:13:53.970
And you know, he's not going to let you go to pot. So you got to drink. You're.

231
00:13:54.240 --> 00:13:58.740
Like he does every day. Uh, this is a real thing by the way you think of joking.

232
00:13:59.940 --> 00:14:03.120
<v 2>Okay. I'm here in London, real world headquarters waiting for Mr. Timothy sheep.</v>

233
00:14:03.240 --> 00:14:08.100
And I have a glass of a beverage. This is my own urine.

234
00:14:08.850 --> 00:14:11.580
<v 0>Yeah. That's a, that's a real thing that really happened.</v>

235
00:14:11.700 --> 00:14:15.570
I think he's deleted the video so far, but Hey, it's the internet detective.

236
00:14:15.600 --> 00:14:17.970
We figured it out. So yeah, you got to do that.

237
00:14:18.210 --> 00:14:21.900
There'll also be breakdancing every third Saturday where you're required to

238
00:14:21.901 --> 00:14:25.800
HeadSpin for 30 seconds. Huh? I don't know.

239
00:14:25.801 --> 00:14:29.070
That seems to play to Brian's strengths a little bit. In fact,

240
00:14:29.071 --> 00:14:30.570
not only does he want you to break dance,

241
00:14:30.690 --> 00:14:34.260
anyone who runs for mayor from now on has to be able to break dents. Look,

242
00:14:34.261 --> 00:14:38.130
he says it in a video. Show me a mayor who can do that. He wants to challenge,

243
00:14:38.430 --> 00:14:41.430
set econ to a breakdancing battle where he thinks his, uh,

244
00:14:41.450 --> 00:14:43.410
he played to his strengths a little bit here.

245
00:14:43.890 --> 00:14:46.560
You must be able to HeadSpin for at least 30 seconds.

246
00:14:46.740 --> 00:14:48.630
If you're going to be mayor. And more importantly,

247
00:14:48.631 --> 00:14:50.400
if you're gonna be a citizen of London,

248
00:14:50.820 --> 00:14:55.090
either you might get locked up next on the agenda.

249
00:14:55.240 --> 00:14:56.770
We've got science first again,

250
00:14:56.800 --> 00:14:59.860
this is just if Brian Rose gets elected calm down, it's not going to happen.

251
00:14:59.861 --> 00:15:02.610
But if he doesn't, he will make London safe.

252
00:15:02.800 --> 00:15:05.350
Get by implementing rigorous science-based decisions.

253
00:15:05.351 --> 00:15:06.880
When it comes to setting policies,

254
00:15:07.180 --> 00:15:10.690
we believe there's been a disproportionate response to the 5g Corona scan.

255
00:15:10.900 --> 00:15:12.520
Oh wow. Okay. Right.

256
00:15:12.850 --> 00:15:15.310
That has caused the loss of countless lives and the let the lizard mint

257
00:15:15.311 --> 00:15:16.450
takeover. Fair enough.

258
00:15:16.840 --> 00:15:20.530
This can be remedied by referring all questions of science to our Supreme

259
00:15:20.531 --> 00:15:22.810
science czar. Dr. David,

260
00:15:25.360 --> 00:15:29.200
congratulations. David, you got yourself, um,

261
00:15:29.400 --> 00:15:34.330
bit of a raise there, I think. Nice. Okay. Okay. Uh, education first,

262
00:15:34.331 --> 00:15:34.901
what's this about?

263
00:15:34.901 --> 00:15:38.680
We will get London back to school to ensure a bright future for our young kids.

264
00:15:39.220 --> 00:15:40.990
And we will remove the culture of textbooks.

265
00:15:41.020 --> 00:15:44.650
And instead every students get an hour of Joe Rogan listening every day,

266
00:15:44.920 --> 00:15:49.330
followed by an hour and one minute of London, real listening guys.

267
00:15:49.330 --> 00:15:52.750
This is his policies. I mean, I'm just reading off of his website, right?

268
00:15:52.810 --> 00:15:54.820
I'm reading off of his website to be clear,

269
00:15:55.390 --> 00:15:59.170
we will create a marketplace of ideas where censorship is no longer permitted on

270
00:15:59.380 --> 00:16:00.550
our digital freedom platforms.

271
00:16:00.910 --> 00:16:05.290
So long as I'm the one uploading the content and or the person talking has

272
00:16:05.291 --> 00:16:09.670
donated. Okay. Uh, yeah, that I think is the,

273
00:16:10.750 --> 00:16:14.710
maybe the worst part is everything will be siphoned through the London real

274
00:16:14.890 --> 00:16:17.200
freedom platform.tv webpage.

275
00:16:17.590 --> 00:16:20.290
So I hope you guys are used to going to that page and putting in your email.

276
00:16:20.350 --> 00:16:22.990
Obviously you have to do that. So the question remains, I mean, look,

277
00:16:22.991 --> 00:16:26.170
I know you're sitting there looking at the color of your own,

278
00:16:26.470 --> 00:16:30.430
wondering when it's going to come to blows or swallows,

279
00:16:30.610 --> 00:16:34.150
but don't worry guys. Cause I also did some digging,

280
00:16:34.151 --> 00:16:37.570
not only into his policies, but also what's his likelihood of getting elected.

281
00:16:37.570 --> 00:16:41.830
Is it true that he's number two in the pulse, right? Or in the bedding?

282
00:16:42.040 --> 00:16:45.370
The bookies, the puppies boys. Well,

283
00:16:46.060 --> 00:16:50.200
I got some bad news there, honestly. Bad news, eh, yes. It's true.

284
00:16:50.470 --> 00:16:54.010
He is number two in the pulse what's going on?

285
00:16:54.400 --> 00:16:56.800
Is it true that he's really got a, what does that say?

286
00:16:56.801 --> 00:17:01.780
A 20% chance of winning it's complicated mystery

287
00:17:02.140 --> 00:17:04.900
because when you actually look up the real polls, you know,

288
00:17:04.930 --> 00:17:07.780
not just a sports bookie website, you find this,

289
00:17:07.781 --> 00:17:12.580
this is the best poll I could find. Uh, Sadiq Khan of course is way ahead.

290
00:17:12.760 --> 00:17:16.480
And then there's a bunch of people and then, Oh,

291
00:17:17.530 --> 00:17:20.410
I can't even get it on screen right now is Arthur.

292
00:17:21.940 --> 00:17:24.670
And Brian is one of the,

293
00:17:25.180 --> 00:17:30.160
they actually just have this basket of others where all the mayor

294
00:17:30.161 --> 00:17:33.040
candidates. Cause it's just so easy to run for. Mayor can go.

295
00:17:33.640 --> 00:17:37.210
And that's where Brian is. So what's going on is Brian and last place,

296
00:17:37.330 --> 00:17:40.630
is he in second place? It's a bit of a mystery.

297
00:17:41.110 --> 00:17:44.290
So I looked into how bookies odds are made.

298
00:17:44.650 --> 00:17:49.170
And basically this is actually what's going on. So in bookie, uh,

299
00:17:49.200 --> 00:17:50.550
odds making, you know,

300
00:17:50.551 --> 00:17:53.280
you obviously want to account for what is the actual likelihood of something

301
00:17:53.281 --> 00:17:54.930
happening, but there's this other factor,

302
00:17:55.260 --> 00:18:00.120
which is that when somebody places a big bet on something, the odds change,

303
00:18:00.150 --> 00:18:02.870
because the book he doesn't want be exposed to like a huge risk.

304
00:18:03.280 --> 00:18:07.910
Cause like let's say someone puts like a million dollars on the underdog. Well,

305
00:18:08.090 --> 00:18:08.923
now that underdog,

306
00:18:08.930 --> 00:18:13.340
even though they're not likely to win the bookie on that weird chance that they

307
00:18:13.341 --> 00:18:15.950
do when they basically don't want to be bankrupt.

308
00:18:16.070 --> 00:18:18.800
So they changed the odds to fit themselves better.

309
00:18:19.340 --> 00:18:23.300
So let me give you guys a hypothetical to explain a, this little bookie making.

310
00:18:23.540 --> 00:18:27.290
Let's just say a grifter looking for attention wants to make waves.

311
00:18:27.680 --> 00:18:32.300
And he has a bunch of cash from free donations to his campaign.

312
00:18:32.301 --> 00:18:35.510
Let's say instead of actually using that money for good causes,

313
00:18:35.900 --> 00:18:39.110
he places a bet on himself. Theoretically,

314
00:18:39.350 --> 00:18:43.580
the odds would change and he could tell his followers he's in second place while

315
00:18:43.581 --> 00:18:45.950
actually not needing to get any votes at all.

316
00:18:46.250 --> 00:18:49.130
He could completely in the election. And the just say it was the lizard people.

317
00:18:49.760 --> 00:18:53.840
So I know that's a little bit, Hey, Hey, let's go to the conspiracy board guys.

318
00:18:53.841 --> 00:18:58.580
Cause I know that's a little bit crazy, right? A little bit peppy Sylvia.

319
00:18:58.610 --> 00:19:01.040
Ooh, I know that's wild,

320
00:19:01.250 --> 00:19:04.400
but I'm going to just go out on a limb here and say that that's what's

321
00:19:04.401 --> 00:19:06.080
happening. So, so fear,

322
00:19:06.081 --> 00:19:10.910
not guys sleep well at night knowing that Brian Rose isn't in second

323
00:19:10.911 --> 00:19:13.970
place. In fact it seems like he's in less place.

324
00:19:14.640 --> 00:19:18.980
So the mystery is solved. Guys. The mystery of Brian Rose running for mayor.

325
00:19:19.010 --> 00:19:22.190
I hope you feel like you've been kept up to date with what's going on because I

326
00:19:22.191 --> 00:19:25.340
know we haven't talked about him and you might see his videos saying that he's

327
00:19:25.341 --> 00:19:28.700
in first place, whatever. No, no. Somebody just placed a big bet on them.

328
00:19:28.730 --> 00:19:32.510
We don't know who, uh, and his odds changed because of it.

329
00:19:32.540 --> 00:19:37.400
But literally the polls are clear. No one knows who this guy is. Of course look,

330
00:19:37.610 --> 00:19:39.470
the challenge is, is that when you're running for mayor,

331
00:19:39.471 --> 00:19:42.290
you have to get actual people in London to vote for you.

332
00:19:42.530 --> 00:19:47.420
Not like the five David followers who still haven't realized that he used them.

333
00:19:47.480 --> 00:19:51.230
He used David Ike, like strictly for clout. Those guys like, yeah,

334
00:19:51.231 --> 00:19:54.230
they're a fan of Brian Rose, but those guys don't usually live in London.

335
00:19:54.530 --> 00:19:56.480
You know, the concentration is all over the world.

336
00:19:56.481 --> 00:19:59.240
He needs to convince people specifically within the city and that's not going to

337
00:19:59.241 --> 00:20:03.830
happen. All right. So that concludes trending Tuesday.

338
00:20:05.450 --> 00:20:07.490
Um, let me know what you guys want to see next.

339
00:20:07.491 --> 00:20:10.370
I know you guys are very invested, sorry to clickbait you with the, uh,

340
00:20:11.650 --> 00:20:15.890
the dream drama guys. I honestly just, can't be bothered to talk about it today,

341
00:20:16.250 --> 00:20:18.530
but let me know what you're interested in seeing,

342
00:20:18.800 --> 00:20:23.390
and I'll make sure to deliver for you guys tomorrow. We got webinar Wednesdays.

343
00:20:23.391 --> 00:20:26.000
Be sure to check it out when we get scammed. So you don't have to.

344
00:20:26.090 --> 00:20:27.350
Thanks for watching and I'll see you.

345
00:20:27.890 --> 00:20:28.070
<v 1>The next.</v>
