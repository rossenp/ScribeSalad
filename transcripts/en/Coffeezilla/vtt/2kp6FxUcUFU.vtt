00:00:00.360 --> 00:00:04.080
<v 0>Ladies and gentlemen, grab a Kleenex, grab something to cry.</v>

2
00:00:04.400 --> 00:00:08.900
<v 1>It's going to be a very sad episode today. Very serious with you guys.</v>

3
00:00:09.140 --> 00:00:12.080
It's going to be about the art of how people retire on YouTube.

4
00:00:12.200 --> 00:00:15.740
How marketers retire. Very depressing.

5
00:00:15.770 --> 00:00:19.610
Please make sure you're somewhere where you can openly cry because compared,

6
00:00:19.910 --> 00:00:22.340
compared to this, the notebook was a comedy.

7
00:00:22.550 --> 00:00:23.960
It's actually why he came in the studio at night.

8
00:00:24.410 --> 00:00:27.230
I didn't want to make anyone sad during their office stay right.

9
00:00:27.231 --> 00:00:30.200
You don't want to cry in front of your coworker. Introducing first,

10
00:00:30.201 --> 00:00:32.870
our first contestant, Kevin David.

11
00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:37.610
<v 0>So for all of those reasons, I'm quitting YouTube.</v>

12
00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:41.210
<v 1>It isn't true. Kevin, after all we've been through together,</v>

13
00:00:41.270 --> 00:00:44.120
you would meet don't quit. Now, what am I going to do with myself?

14
00:00:44.150 --> 00:00:46.370
How am I going to make YouTube videos of you've quit? Oh,

15
00:00:47.960 --> 00:00:50.150
I quit social media for 48 hours.

16
00:00:50.800 --> 00:00:52.520
<v 0>Or we do actually get into all of those.</v>

17
00:00:52.521 --> 00:00:56.780
I do want to take just a few quick seconds and address my last video about

18
00:00:56.781 --> 00:00:58.160
quitting YouTube because wow,

19
00:00:58.161 --> 00:01:01.460
hands of thousands of views in the first couple of hours.

20
00:01:03.140 --> 00:01:06.740
<v 1>When you retire, the view counter goes to marketers,</v>

21
00:01:06.741 --> 00:01:10.190
are this really weird species of human? Where nothing means what it says.

22
00:01:10.191 --> 00:01:14.450
They mean, I mean, take Billy. Gene is marketing. He didn't only quit YouTube.

23
00:01:14.480 --> 00:01:16.760
He said, he's retiring for good.

24
00:01:17.120 --> 00:01:19.070
<v 2>What's up. It's Billy. And I know you're busy, so I'll be quick.</v>

25
00:01:19.071 --> 00:01:21.980
I sent this to you in your email. Um,

26
00:01:22.010 --> 00:01:24.320
but if you didn't have a chance to read it yet, I wanted to let you know that,

27
00:01:24.500 --> 00:01:27.590
uh, I am retiring. Uh, so what I did, um,

28
00:01:27.650 --> 00:01:31.790
as I took everything I've ever created, and I'm just pretty much giving it away.

29
00:01:32.330 --> 00:01:35.990
<v 1>Giving it away, which is code that's marketer,</v>

30
00:01:36.010 --> 00:01:40.370
speak for selling it for $69. That's right. Giving it away.

31
00:01:40.371 --> 00:01:44.360
I'm practically giving it away guys for $69.

32
00:01:44.450 --> 00:01:48.170
And actually we learned two weeks into his long retirement. I mean,

33
00:01:48.171 --> 00:01:52.250
this is a man who needs to rest from all his hard labor teaching everyone how to

34
00:01:52.251 --> 00:01:56.990
market effectively. He decided to drop another video. He came out of retirement.

35
00:01:57.560 --> 00:02:01.160
How to create a giveaway that gets a ton of engagement.

36
00:02:01.610 --> 00:02:05.270
How do you turn a giveaway into actual sales? Oh boy,

37
00:02:05.300 --> 00:02:06.990
I feel like I already know the answer to this.

38
00:02:09.380 --> 00:02:10.850
<v 2>Simple and easy way to do it. You can do it today.</v>

39
00:02:11.240 --> 00:02:13.340
Cause there's one thing Garney interests with people who want stuff for free,

40
00:02:13.341 --> 00:02:14.750
pretty much giving it away.

41
00:02:14.780 --> 00:02:18.320
But how do you actually translate that into money in your pocket?

42
00:02:18.740 --> 00:02:23.150
<v 1>Step one, retire. Step two, charge $69 for your giveaway.</v>

43
00:02:23.660 --> 00:02:26.840
Now guys, the first two, I mean, I know I was joking, but this one,

44
00:02:28.130 --> 00:02:30.140
this one we're at really well, bring it to your, to your eyes,

45
00:02:30.200 --> 00:02:34.010
ladies and gentlemen, can we get a sad, uh, some sad music going,

46
00:02:34.011 --> 00:02:37.040
please come on. Let's play. I'll just start playing.

47
00:02:37.370 --> 00:02:38.203
<v 0>Some sad music.</v>

48
00:02:43.400 --> 00:02:47.480
<v 1>Um, you know, this is a very sad moment. We have one of the greatest YouTubers,</v>

49
00:02:48.440 --> 00:02:51.620
Jagger nuggets, retiring guys. Things will never be the same.

50
00:02:52.190 --> 00:02:53.023
<v 0>You usually don't</v>

51
00:02:56.600 --> 00:02:57.500
get a close up. Nick.

52
00:03:01.830 --> 00:03:05.100
<v 1>Why did he say get a closeup? Like as if he's going to say something important,</v>

53
00:03:05.580 --> 00:03:08.190
but then it's just of him drinking water. Why not take that out?

54
00:03:08.191 --> 00:03:09.540
Is it to make it more sad?

55
00:03:09.660 --> 00:03:13.860
I have a picture of you pathetically drinking water from a chalice.

56
00:03:14.250 --> 00:03:18.930
<v 3>Oh, something like close your neck closer.</v>

57
00:03:20.340 --> 00:03:21.780
Get closer, Nick.

58
00:03:24.540 --> 00:03:27.870
I really want to emphasize guys. This is not a series.

59
00:03:28.380 --> 00:03:30.060
This is not a clickbait video.

60
00:03:30.660 --> 00:03:35.580
I will be officially quitting YouTube as of January 1st, 2020,

61
00:03:35.700 --> 00:03:37.020
January 1st, 2020.

62
00:03:39.930 --> 00:03:44.220
This is the last video I'll ever make on YouTube. It doesn't feel real.

63
00:03:44.221 --> 00:03:45.054
It really doesn't.

64
00:03:45.480 --> 00:03:50.280
It's scary for me to think that this is the last video I will ensure this works,

65
00:03:50.281 --> 00:03:55.260
but I always suck at saying that story fire doesn't CC'd I will

66
00:03:55.261 --> 00:03:58.560
die by the fire. Wait, what?

67
00:04:01.050 --> 00:04:05.580
<v 1>No, there's no need to do that. Uh, Jagger nuggets. That is my guarantee to you.</v>

68
00:04:06.030 --> 00:04:07.200
Wow.

69
00:04:09.150 --> 00:04:09.983
<v 3>No.</v>

70
00:04:10.140 --> 00:04:11.970
<v 1>No guarantees necessary. You don't have.</v>

71
00:04:11.970 --> 00:04:14.070
<v 3>To do I make a decision. I own it. And I commit.</v>

72
00:04:14.160 --> 00:04:17.490
<v 1>And you guys heard it here. I mean, we can't talk them out of it.</v>

73
00:04:19.860 --> 00:04:20.693
<v 3>Barbara.</v>

74
00:04:21.780 --> 00:04:26.310
I'm willing to do the hard things and let go of things that have been in my life

75
00:04:26.730 --> 00:04:27.563
forever.

76
00:04:27.750 --> 00:04:32.310
It's like when somebody passes away or you lose somebody

77
00:04:32.520 --> 00:04:36.960
and you can't get them back so much, you want to say,

78
00:04:37.440 --> 00:04:42.150
or if only I did this or I'll never be enough and I'm sure

79
00:04:42.840 --> 00:04:45.170
years from now, I'll be like, Oh, I wish I,

80
00:04:45.550 --> 00:04:49.980
I wish they knew how much they meant to me. I really hope I articulated that.

81
00:04:50.670 --> 00:04:50.920
Wow.

82
00:04:50.920 --> 00:04:53.790
<v 1>I didn't actually believe it was a farewell video at first.</v>

83
00:04:53.791 --> 00:04:57.390
I thought it was another one of these clickbait liars who would come back to the

84
00:04:57.391 --> 00:05:01.560
platform within weeks. Maybe even days, but not you McJagger nuggets.

85
00:05:01.590 --> 00:05:03.630
When you say something, you stick by it.

86
00:05:05.580 --> 00:05:10.260
<v 3>I'm going to close this off for the last time forever. All right.</v>

87
00:05:10.680 --> 00:05:12.690
Jeez. Oh. Be able to death

88
00:05:15.390 --> 00:05:18.420
and don't forget to keep it rigid.

89
00:05:27.120 --> 00:05:30.270
<v 1>Keep it rigid. Who, who approved that?</v>

90
00:05:30.360 --> 00:05:34.350
If you're all off about getting demonetized? I think I have the solution.

91
00:05:34.500 --> 00:05:36.600
I have the crystal ball. If you don't tell your face.

92
00:05:37.650 --> 00:05:42.060
<v 3>To keep it rigid, it stay lit. Okay.</v>

93
00:05:44.040 --> 00:05:47.340
<v 1>Now you're just playing with me. That's all my fault. That's my fault.</v>

94
00:05:47.370 --> 00:05:51.690
I was taking this seriously. You're close at your final words. You know what?

95
00:05:51.750 --> 00:05:53.850
When you were saying, I want to say the right word.

96
00:05:54.310 --> 00:05:59.030
<v 3>So much. You want to say the eulogy? It's like when somebody passes away.</v>

97
00:05:59.060 --> 00:06:02.390
<v 1>I don't know what to say. I thought to myself, you don't need the right words,</v>

98
00:06:02.600 --> 00:06:06.680
but I take that back there. Aren't right words. But there are wrong words.

99
00:06:07.040 --> 00:06:10.430
Keep it rigid. By the way, I know this looks like I'm being mean to him.

100
00:06:10.431 --> 00:06:14.090
Just wait 20 seconds. Okay. Don't get mad at me for 20 seconds.

101
00:06:14.990 --> 00:06:15.830
Everything will make sense.

102
00:06:31.360 --> 00:06:32.193
<v 3>Check your full life.</v>

103
00:06:35.500 --> 00:06:37.330
<v 1>I have returned one month.</v>

104
00:06:37.990 --> 00:06:41.620
<v 3>I'm wondering why you channel back please. I don't have any money.</v>

105
00:06:41.770 --> 00:06:46.750
I need my journal back. Uh, Joe, it's you guys.

106
00:06:47.080 --> 00:06:48.790
I think we should have a sit down conversation.

107
00:06:48.791 --> 00:06:52.870
Kind of like how I left this whole thing. I will die by the fire.

108
00:06:53.950 --> 00:06:56.500
We got a lot to talk about. That is my guarantee to you.

109
00:06:56.770 --> 00:07:00.070
I should've never been so negative towards YouTube and like, to be fair.

110
00:07:00.071 --> 00:07:03.070
I still don't agree with a lot of the things that they've done,

111
00:07:03.180 --> 00:07:04.600
especially to me personally,

112
00:07:04.601 --> 00:07:07.540
with demonetization and all those things I talked about before,

113
00:07:07.541 --> 00:07:09.280
but I don't want to get into that. Um,

114
00:07:09.310 --> 00:07:13.180
I still don't agree with a lot of things still being part of sport, but, um,

115
00:07:13.450 --> 00:07:15.280
I really just wanted to help people.

116
00:07:16.600 --> 00:07:20.350
That's what's brought me back more than anything I [inaudible].

117
00:07:20.950 --> 00:07:23.110
<v 4>Is it really? Is it.</v>

118
00:07:23.440 --> 00:07:27.130
<v 1>You weren't too lit over there. You weren't as rigid as you remember.</v>

119
00:07:28.600 --> 00:07:31.930
<v 3>I want to see how you guys are doing. I want to make sure you guys are okay.</v>

120
00:07:31.960 --> 00:07:36.010
I know a lot of my audience didn't follow me over to story fire and that sucks.

121
00:07:36.170 --> 00:07:39.760
<v 1>This is painful guys. This is the life of a retiree YouTuber.</v>

122
00:07:39.761 --> 00:07:42.070
They always say I'm retiring. I'm going to do that.

123
00:07:42.071 --> 00:07:45.460
Literally means I have a marketing gimmick, a stunt plan.

124
00:07:45.490 --> 00:07:46.870
This is a gigantic stunt.

125
00:07:47.140 --> 00:07:51.790
They're not actually being genuine or that's what I did think until I saw this.

126
00:07:51.910 --> 00:07:54.760
<v 4>What's up guys. Thank you so much for hitting this page.</v>

127
00:07:54.790 --> 00:07:56.590
As you saw from the other video,

128
00:07:57.010 --> 00:08:00.130
I'm taking a break and I'm retiring with a very heavy heart.

129
00:08:00.610 --> 00:08:02.800
<v 1>Ladies and gentlemen, I don't mean to Pat myself on the back,</v>

130
00:08:02.801 --> 00:08:06.910
but it takes a big man to admit when he was wrong and wow. Was I wrong?

131
00:08:06.940 --> 00:08:08.590
This is Maxim Trubisky.

132
00:08:08.710 --> 00:08:12.340
I used to think all marketers were the same till I saw max icy.

133
00:08:12.341 --> 00:08:16.450
A man of class of honor. Someone who wouldn't lie to us.

134
00:08:16.930 --> 00:08:21.820
This is a man. Look at this poor guy. He's in a cast to cast double cast.

135
00:08:22.330 --> 00:08:24.280
It's Christmas. He's laying in bed,

136
00:08:24.610 --> 00:08:27.580
but he won't let that stop him from helping humanity.

137
00:08:28.570 --> 00:08:32.440
<v 4>After talking with doctors for weeks, talking with my family,</v>

138
00:08:32.920 --> 00:08:35.080
flying over them out here to Los Angeles,

139
00:08:35.650 --> 00:08:40.540
I have decided I will focus entirely on my recovery from the skiing accident.

140
00:08:40.630 --> 00:08:45.070
<v 1>You focus max, you do whatever you have to do, buddy. I feel bad, honestly,</v>

141
00:08:45.071 --> 00:08:49.390
for accusing these YouTubers of faking retirement, that is not right.

142
00:08:49.980 --> 00:08:52.810
You know, you take all the time. You need, you've done so much for the world.

143
00:08:54.010 --> 00:08:56.130
Uh, so why are you making this video? Anyway, every.

144
00:08:56.130 --> 00:09:01.080
<v 4>Single Shopify e-comm brand we built and didn't run</v>

145
00:09:01.680 --> 00:09:06.390
that we were gonna run in 2021 and the end of 2020 for the holiday

146
00:09:06.391 --> 00:09:11.040
season, because we have about 20 brands that we built, which are.

147
00:09:12.320 --> 00:09:16.760
<v 1>This is a sales pitch. It's just to set this man broke his arms.</v>

148
00:09:16.820 --> 00:09:20.810
Literally this man has to use it to sell you something. He cannot.

149
00:09:20.811 --> 00:09:24.260
He's like Billy Jean. He can't even go away and leave us alone. And he's like,

150
00:09:24.290 --> 00:09:27.860
I got to sell, Hey, I got some for you and it's going to cost you.

151
00:09:28.310 --> 00:09:32.420
<v 4>But unfortunately I will not be able to focus on these new brands.</v>

152
00:09:32.510 --> 00:09:35.180
So these 20 brands that are already done, right?

153
00:09:35.181 --> 00:09:37.460
We feel we've built them before. They're already finished.

154
00:09:37.610 --> 00:09:38.600
We're going to run them ourselves.

155
00:09:39.140 --> 00:09:42.140
<v 1>So then just run them yourself. I don't understand don't you have a team.</v>

156
00:09:42.141 --> 00:09:43.130
I can't, you run them yourself.

157
00:09:43.880 --> 00:09:47.570
<v 4>And instead of one of you guys, if you're watching this video,</v>

158
00:09:47.580 --> 00:09:52.040
now you can get access to a fully built business, a fully done brand.

159
00:09:52.160 --> 00:09:54.440
<v 1>Oh, he's just such a nice guy.</v>

160
00:09:54.920 --> 00:09:59.240
How much is he selling this for $20 and look only two stores remaining.

161
00:09:59.270 --> 00:10:00.350
Oh my gosh.

162
00:10:01.010 --> 00:10:04.970
Only two stores remaining ladies and gentlemen terrified,

163
00:10:05.810 --> 00:10:06.621
but wait a second.

164
00:10:06.621 --> 00:10:10.130
What's this there's another video on his Vimeo account that was left public.

165
00:10:10.220 --> 00:10:14.840
Oops. Oh no. Max video nine Christmas.

166
00:10:14.841 --> 00:10:18.560
What's this. He says that he was only selling this to 20 people, right?

167
00:10:18.561 --> 00:10:20.120
He only had 20 stores.

168
00:10:20.660 --> 00:10:21.471
<v 4>What's up guys.</v>

169
00:10:21.471 --> 00:10:25.670
Thank you so much for being one of the 20 students that now have your hands on a

170
00:10:25.671 --> 00:10:27.290
brand new business.

171
00:10:27.500 --> 00:10:31.220
<v 1>But oops, Whoa, wait, wait, wait. How many views does this video have?</v>

172
00:10:31.250 --> 00:10:34.910
The only people who would have been watching this are people who bought the

173
00:10:34.911 --> 00:10:38.720
course, right? So it's 20 views, right? Or 21 views. Cause I'm here to,

174
00:10:40.010 --> 00:10:42.410
Oh, what's this 455.

175
00:10:42.830 --> 00:10:45.770
Does that mean 455 people purchased 20 stores.

176
00:10:48.480 --> 00:10:51.500
You're you're telling me that there weren't only 20 stores.

177
00:10:51.800 --> 00:10:53.720
That would have to be that. Oh my gosh. Shannon, Claus. Isn't real.

178
00:10:53.721 --> 00:10:57.710
And there aren't only two stores remaining. Oh, no way, dude.

179
00:10:57.740 --> 00:11:02.180
I don't believe it. I can't believe it guys. That that's impossible. Next.

180
00:11:02.181 --> 00:11:06.080
You're going to tell me that the tooth fairy isn't real. No way, dude. No way.

181
00:11:06.260 --> 00:11:08.060
I don't believe it, dude.

182
00:11:08.061 --> 00:11:12.140
I think this is honestly my favorite one because he's monetizing his own injury

183
00:11:12.470 --> 00:11:16.130
and lying about what his intentions are. I'm retiring, I'm retiring,

184
00:11:16.490 --> 00:11:18.920
you're leaving for two months, selling all the way,

185
00:11:18.950 --> 00:11:20.600
getting your team's calls all the way.

186
00:11:20.600 --> 00:11:22.280
And you're probably not even leaving for two months.

187
00:11:22.640 --> 00:11:24.170
I'm just going to say this right now.

188
00:11:24.920 --> 00:11:28.910
Anytime at YouTube makes a big deal about retiring and Oh my gosh guys,

189
00:11:28.911 --> 00:11:33.080
I'm sorry. I'm going to leave 90% chance. It's fake.

190
00:11:33.860 --> 00:11:36.320
I mean, I hate to be the bearer of bad news and everything.

191
00:11:36.321 --> 00:11:39.860
I hate to be that guy right? To tell you this,

192
00:11:40.160 --> 00:11:44.090
to spoil things for you, the magic of YouTube, but it's true.

193
00:11:44.510 --> 00:11:47.540
These people, uh,

194
00:11:47.550 --> 00:11:52.280
they used to use retirement for clickbait and profit and I love to see it guys.

195
00:11:52.281 --> 00:11:55.330
Let me know who your favorite was of our little series here.

196
00:11:55.410 --> 00:11:56.800
And I think if we can agree on anything,

197
00:11:56.801 --> 00:11:59.710
it's that marketers are a different breed of human.

198
00:11:59.920 --> 00:12:02.860
They're just another level anyways. That's it for now? See you next time.

199
00:12:09.150 --> 00:12:09.150
