00:00:00.210 --> 00:00:03.750
<v 0>Ladies and gentlemen, it's finally here at long,</v>

2
00:00:03.751 --> 00:00:06.240
last after hours, days, weeks,

3
00:00:06.241 --> 00:00:10.140
months of work on the $10 million studio.

4
00:00:10.141 --> 00:00:14.730
We finally finished on Friday and I am happy to say the

5
00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:19.470
studios up and running better than ever. Welcome to two to one C Baker street,

6
00:00:19.950 --> 00:00:23.250
copy Zillow's office, home of the internet detective.

7
00:00:23.280 --> 00:00:26.610
They said I could be anything. So it became an internet detective.

8
00:00:27.350 --> 00:00:30.170
And I'm going to walk you through my whole set, but I first want to say,

9
00:00:30.171 --> 00:00:33.830
look guys, this is not some amateur operation anymore. We're leveling up.

10
00:00:33.860 --> 00:00:36.410
We are now professional internet detectives.

11
00:00:36.411 --> 00:00:39.650
Does that mean we're better researched or any more knowledgeable than we were

12
00:00:39.651 --> 00:00:40.910
before? No,

13
00:00:41.240 --> 00:00:45.620
but what it does mean is that we have the appearance and the appearance of

14
00:00:45.621 --> 00:00:46.311
credibility,

15
00:00:46.311 --> 00:00:50.450
the appearance of being well-dressed well lit because that's a big lesson I

16
00:00:50.451 --> 00:00:52.520
learned during the pandemic. I got to tell you,

17
00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:57.170
and I hope this inspires you at home. Nobody's smarter than you.

18
00:00:57.200 --> 00:01:01.700
Nobody knows anything. You don't. What they are is they're richer than you.

19
00:01:01.820 --> 00:01:03.980
They're better dressed than you. And they're better left than you.

20
00:01:04.310 --> 00:01:07.910
What's the difference between you and the people immediate. Seriously?

21
00:01:07.911 --> 00:01:11.000
I realized this, actually I was feeling little down and out,

22
00:01:11.120 --> 00:01:14.000
to be honest with you guys, we all experienced those times of self doubt.

23
00:01:14.450 --> 00:01:19.010
I don't know if you guys can relate to that, but who picked me up was not,

24
00:01:19.011 --> 00:01:21.860
you know, it was not my traditional inspirations right now.

25
00:01:21.861 --> 00:01:25.250
I'm going for a cross between somewhere between Chris Cuomo and Alex Jones,

26
00:01:25.580 --> 00:01:28.820
trying to kind of hit all the bases, but that's not who inspired me,

27
00:01:28.821 --> 00:01:31.970
ladies and gentlemen who inspired me were America's sweethearts.

28
00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:33.770
And I'm going to demonstrate it to you actually,

29
00:01:33.771 --> 00:01:35.960
by showing off a little feature of the studio, actually,

30
00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:41.630
these are the people who really made me realize something profound. Yes,

31
00:01:41.631 --> 00:01:46.070
that's right. America's late night hosts. Oh wow.

32
00:01:46.940 --> 00:01:49.760
Were they humbled this year? Weren't they, they had to go back.

33
00:01:49.761 --> 00:01:53.600
They had to get taken away from their beautiful sets from their makeup artists

34
00:01:54.290 --> 00:01:55.880
and torn away from that.

35
00:01:57.080 --> 00:02:00.410
I suddenly felt a lot better about not being that entertaining or funny or

36
00:02:00.411 --> 00:02:04.640
talented. I realized, Hey, these guys aren't either.

37
00:02:04.970 --> 00:02:06.830
It's just movie magic. That's all it is.

38
00:02:07.460 --> 00:02:12.290
Our little brains think that people dressed up in suits lit really

39
00:02:12.291 --> 00:02:15.440
well with beautiful backgrounds. We think they're credible.

40
00:02:15.620 --> 00:02:18.350
There's nothing more or less credible about them.

41
00:02:18.830 --> 00:02:23.300
They've just got a team that dresses them up really nice. So I realized, Oh,

42
00:02:23.660 --> 00:02:27.380
well, if that's the only problem, then we can fix it.

43
00:02:27.450 --> 00:02:31.430
That's something we can fix. I was thinking I had to get a personality,

44
00:02:32.360 --> 00:02:35.570
start writing, funny jokes, but watching these guys,

45
00:02:35.630 --> 00:02:39.680
let me just say I was truly inspired. So I built this. So without further ado,

46
00:02:39.710 --> 00:02:42.200
I want to show you the full set we built.

47
00:02:42.250 --> 00:02:44.930
First thing I want to show you is actually a cool little feature of this screen

48
00:02:44.931 --> 00:02:47.750
back here, where I can show you what's going on. What I'm looking at.

49
00:02:48.140 --> 00:02:51.350
It actually rotates sideways to get, go into like a cool portrait mode.

50
00:02:51.351 --> 00:02:52.184
Check this out.

51
00:02:52.490 --> 00:02:56.780
This is a gigantic or deal setting this up and with that beautiful transition

52
00:02:56.781 --> 00:03:00.640
before I show you anything else, any yet, any of other features of the studio,

53
00:03:00.641 --> 00:03:04.270
I need to introduce you to someone special someone who I could not have done

54
00:03:04.271 --> 00:03:07.120
this about someone who held my hand every step of the way,

55
00:03:07.121 --> 00:03:09.850
someone who supported me through this whole journey.

56
00:03:10.270 --> 00:03:13.330
I'm talking of course of my designer, ed.

57
00:03:14.170 --> 00:03:15.880
And thank you for coming on the show.

58
00:03:16.030 --> 00:03:18.430
You're the architect of a $10 million studio.

59
00:03:18.431 --> 00:03:20.980
I could not have done this without you. Uh,

60
00:03:21.040 --> 00:03:23.590
and the first thing people should know is where you're from.

61
00:03:23.740 --> 00:03:25.930
Because when I was deciding where to hire from,

62
00:03:25.960 --> 00:03:30.220
did I hire from the U S the land of the privileged? No.

63
00:03:31.540 --> 00:03:34.930
So instead I chose Ukraine. Ed,

64
00:03:35.680 --> 00:03:36.790
how are things over there?

65
00:03:37.830 --> 00:03:38.760
<v 1>Yeah, it's pretty bad.</v>

66
00:03:41.670 --> 00:03:43.110
They're stimulating my economy.

67
00:03:44.580 --> 00:03:46.920
<v 0>The biggest thing since Hunter Biden, Ukraine,</v>

68
00:03:46.950 --> 00:03:50.010
hasn't had a lot of big ticket Americans come on through.

69
00:03:50.040 --> 00:03:54.570
It's basically Hunter Biden and me stimulating the world economy.

70
00:03:55.650 --> 00:03:59.490
Uh, thank you so much though. You're a legend. When I saw your work,

71
00:03:59.580 --> 00:04:02.730
I haven't seen anything like it. And, um,

72
00:04:03.060 --> 00:04:06.390
I knew you'd be the exact person to take things to the next level.

73
00:04:06.391 --> 00:04:08.580
Just as a curiosity, how was I as a boss?

74
00:04:08.790 --> 00:04:11.790
We've been working on this project together for like how many months now?

75
00:04:11.880 --> 00:04:15.840
<v 1>It's like a couple of months, I think like, uh, in my,</v>

76
00:04:15.870 --> 00:04:19.260
in my schedule it was, but it feels like years. Really.

77
00:04:19.680 --> 00:04:23.970
<v 0>Okay. That's how we're going to do this interview. Okay. All right. Listen,</v>

78
00:04:24.150 --> 00:04:25.260

79
00:04:25.290 --> 00:04:29.160

00:04:48.270 --> 00:04:51.120
the way I want to show you the rest of the studio guys,

87
00:04:51.150 --> 00:04:54.600
someone I've always been very inspired by is Charlie Kelly from always sunny in

88
00:04:54.601 --> 00:04:59.040
Philadelphia. This is a man who knows what's going on in the mailroom.

89
00:04:59.490 --> 00:05:00.690
<v 2>Uh, can we talk about the mail please?</v>

90
00:05:00.691 --> 00:05:03.810
Malcolm and dying to talk about the mail for you all day. Okay. Pepe, Silvia,

91
00:05:03.811 --> 00:05:05.940
this name keeps coming up over and over again. Every day.

92
00:05:05.941 --> 00:05:08.550
Peppa is mail is getting sent back to me that they sold me up at Bay Sylvia.

93
00:05:08.551 --> 00:05:10.110
I look at the milk was this whole process.

94
00:05:11.280 --> 00:05:13.770
<v 0>So obviously I had to do a bit of an homage to that.</v>

95
00:05:13.771 --> 00:05:17.400
This is our research corner, ladies and gentlemen, right here. Boom.

96
00:05:20.580 --> 00:05:25.080
This is where we uncover. What's really going on in the world in the deep state,

97
00:05:25.530 --> 00:05:29.280
whatever you want to call it. She knows I'm not a conspiracy guy,

98
00:05:29.850 --> 00:05:33.240
but if something slides across my desk, it's interesting. If that makes sense,

99
00:05:33.510 --> 00:05:35.850
this is where we're going to talk about it. Next.

100
00:05:35.910 --> 00:05:38.880
I want to show you where all the calculations are done because guys,

101
00:05:38.881 --> 00:05:43.230
the days of the gumshoe detective is over the era of internet.

102
00:05:43.231 --> 00:05:47.160
Detectives is here. Most fraud is done online. And to catch that fraud,

103
00:05:47.190 --> 00:05:51.570
you need the cutting edge computers, the cutting edge graphics cards.

104
00:05:51.780 --> 00:05:54.720
CPU's sound cards. You need the cutting edge, everything.

105
00:05:55.110 --> 00:05:57.770
Now I will tell you that this over here,

106
00:05:57.771 --> 00:06:02.450
it also doubles as an incredible battle station to play among us to play

107
00:06:02.480 --> 00:06:05.420
fall. Guys, no games that are graphic intensive, right?

108
00:06:05.421 --> 00:06:08.060
We don't play little baby party games like call of duty.

109
00:06:08.061 --> 00:06:12.710
We only play the most graphic intensive games that require 20 RTX,

110
00:06:12.711 --> 00:06:16.280
20, 80 Nvidia graphics cards. That's all we do.

111
00:06:16.670 --> 00:06:20.900
But this is mostly where we monitor the social accounts of all these gurus,

112
00:06:20.901 --> 00:06:24.590
where we find out what the, the latest fraud is before anyone else does.

113
00:06:24.591 --> 00:06:27.830
You guys know the FTC oftentimes out to lunch.

114
00:06:27.920 --> 00:06:30.110
So hopefully we can catch a few things here.

115
00:06:30.140 --> 00:06:32.810
This is where we're going to do that at next,

116
00:06:32.960 --> 00:06:37.880
when the investigation winds down, when we need to relax,

117
00:06:37.970 --> 00:06:41.300
I don't know if you guys know this, but I have a passion for playing piano.

118
00:06:41.301 --> 00:06:46.130
So we had to of course, throw a grand piano in there. Something that, uh,

119
00:06:46.490 --> 00:06:47.900
you know, it's fully playable.

120
00:06:47.901 --> 00:06:51.620
You guys know that this is a real $10 million studio set,

121
00:06:51.621 --> 00:06:53.300
and that would not be complete without a real.

122
00:06:56.830 --> 00:06:57.910
<v 3>This is really neat playing.</v>

123
00:07:07.390 --> 00:07:09.520
<v 0>That another time, just when we're, we're just,</v>

124
00:07:09.820 --> 00:07:13.180
maybe people are filing in for a live stream, whatever we're doing,

125
00:07:13.480 --> 00:07:16.150
this is where we can have that kind of rapport.

126
00:07:16.151 --> 00:07:20.410
We're going to play some banger songs hits top 100 charts songs.

127
00:07:20.680 --> 00:07:22.900
This is where there'll be played at. Everyone knows that the,

128
00:07:23.710 --> 00:07:27.100
the real cutting edge music and pop is jazz piano. So

129
00:07:30.400 --> 00:07:32.950
That's where we're going to do it. Guys. Everyone knows that's the new thing,

130
00:07:33.470 --> 00:07:37.930
new wave. So that's where it's going to happen. Moving on one last thing,

131
00:07:38.140 --> 00:07:41.080
if you're not convinced yet the coffee's Hill is going places.

132
00:07:41.081 --> 00:07:43.510
The new season of coffee's Hill is going to be the best yet.

133
00:07:43.720 --> 00:07:46.990
Let me give you guys some incentive. First of all,

134
00:07:48.580 --> 00:07:53.440
this channel would be nothing without each and every one of you guys at home

watching, supporting subscribing sharing.

136
00:07:57.610 --> 00:07:59.650
And I want to give back to you guys.

137
00:07:59.710 --> 00:08:02.800
So I had this idea that at 1 million subscribers,

138
00:08:03.010 --> 00:08:04.990
we're going to do something massive.

139
00:08:05.500 --> 00:08:08.320
And this is the 1 million subscribers DOR.

140
00:08:08.321 --> 00:08:11.440
Currently our big surprise taped up. You know,

141
00:08:11.441 --> 00:08:12.970
it's going to be bigger than Mr. Beast.

142
00:08:13.090 --> 00:08:15.340
It's going to be bigger than all these other big YouTubers.

143
00:08:15.341 --> 00:08:18.580
You'd like to throw giant events. It's going to be bigger than that.

144
00:08:18.610 --> 00:08:22.870
Bigger than Fortnite, bigger than I dunno. What's the new game. Cyberpunk 20,

145
00:08:22.871 --> 00:08:27.250
77 guys. When we hit 1 million subscribers,

146
00:08:27.670 --> 00:08:32.320
we're going to break it down, open this door. And the world of coffees,

147
00:08:32.550 --> 00:08:36.580
Zillow will never be the same. So if any of this interests, you guys,

148
00:08:36.910 --> 00:08:41.770
the detective stuff, the investigations, the new AR everything about it,

149
00:08:41.830 --> 00:08:44.560
the jazz, if that's something that you're into,

150
00:08:44.860 --> 00:08:47.440
please consider subscribing supporting the channel.

151
00:08:47.770 --> 00:08:51.940
I'm so grateful that you guys got me here and I want to take it even farther.

00:08:51.941 --> 00:08:54.280
I want to give you guys products. You're proud of.

153
00:08:54.310 --> 00:08:59.160
I really believe that we can start competing production for production

154
00:08:59.220 --> 00:09:02.010
with the best of, uh, with the Netflixes of the world. Okay?

155
00:09:02.011 --> 00:09:04.470
Maybe not Netflix yet, but TV for sure.

156
00:09:05.010 --> 00:09:08.610
We're going places that no one's gone before. And if you'd like to join up,

157
00:09:08.870 --> 00:09:11.940
now's a great time to do it. We only have 200,000 subscribers.

158
00:09:12.510 --> 00:09:14.100
We're going right to the moon boys.

159
00:09:14.130 --> 00:09:18.090
So I hope you enjoyed this brief tour of the studio. This is only the beginning.

160
00:09:18.091 --> 00:09:21.450
You guys should see this place when it goes to night. I mean,

161
00:09:21.570 --> 00:09:26.490
when the investigation turns a little darker guys, it goes even further. But I,

162
00:09:26.500 --> 00:09:28.080
I don't want to spoil too much, honestly.

163
00:09:28.081 --> 00:09:31.770
I want you guys to experience it the way I did the first time.

164
00:09:31.950 --> 00:09:34.700
I'm just really over the moon about how all of this turned out.

165
00:09:34.710 --> 00:09:39.330
I can't even explain it. Like I'm so excited for what the future holds.

166
00:09:39.331 --> 00:09:42.540
I don't remember the last time I've been this excited about the future of my

167
00:09:42.541 --> 00:09:46.050
channel. And you know, I can honestly say this next season of coffee.

168
00:09:46.470 --> 00:09:49.560
Zilla is going to be one to remember. Thank you guys for watching.

169
00:09:49.650 --> 00:09:51.960
Thanks to all of you. Who've inspired me along the way.

170
00:09:52.110 --> 00:09:55.410
Who've supported me along the way. I wouldn't be here without you guys.

171
00:09:56.280 --> 00:09:57.690
We'll see you in the next investigation.
