00:00:01.350 --> 00:00:05.070
<v 0>Hey, welcome back to the $10 million studio.</v>

2
00:00:05.640 --> 00:00:07.710
I know it seems like we're changing all the time,

3
00:00:07.711 --> 00:00:11.100
but actually we're just moving within the same room.

4
00:00:11.130 --> 00:00:14.070
We're trying different ways of organizing the set to make it easier for you

5
00:00:14.071 --> 00:00:18.570
guys. This is doubling right now as a screen, but actually look at this.

6
00:00:18.870 --> 00:00:22.620
I can turn it off. Boom, boom. There's our board. Huh?

7
00:00:23.310 --> 00:00:27.150
Not too shabby. And as you can see, moved into a new place,

8
00:00:27.151 --> 00:00:30.900
there's an annoying guy. Next door. He's kind of snooping around,

9
00:00:30.930 --> 00:00:34.260
which is kind of annoying. Ben cumberbun or something like that.

10
00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:37.080
I don't know what his name is. He's always trailed by his fumbling side.

11
00:00:37.081 --> 00:00:39.570
Kick out of it. I don't know what it's about. Cause they're kind of weird.

12
00:00:39.571 --> 00:00:42.330
I don't know what their deal is, but nevertheless,

13
00:00:42.331 --> 00:00:43.650
we're not going to let that stop us.

14
00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:47.850
It's some good real estate for finding out the new mysteries of the internet

15
00:00:47.851 --> 00:00:50.280
from digging up the scams from exposing the frauds.

16
00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:53.670
So thank you for joining me on this journey. Now,

17
00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:58.230
today we are reacting to fake gurus calling out fake gurus. And let me say,

18
00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:02.670
I'm having trouble here seeing my future because I just invested in a

19
00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:05.430
$10 billion studio to call out fake gurus.

20
00:01:06.690 --> 00:01:11.130
And I'm going to be out of a job soon because I can't call out the fake gurus

21
00:01:11.131 --> 00:01:13.890
faster than the fake gurus are calling out the vagaries. You won't believe it.

22
00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:18.600
I never thought in a million years that the strategy of a fake guru would

23
00:01:18.601 --> 00:01:22.350
be to call out fake gurus. I don't know what the idea there is.

24
00:01:22.410 --> 00:01:24.660
Like do they not think we'll see through it?

25
00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:28.740
Let's find out here's a few that I collected today for us to look at together.

26
00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:30.840
So this is our first guy and I'm just going to say here,

27
00:01:30.841 --> 00:01:33.630
I see this not as a video, but as actually an ad,

28
00:01:33.660 --> 00:01:37.080
this guy is spending money to call out fake. It's insane.

29
00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:41.090
<v 1>Oh, this another online business group. I don't know about you,</v>

30
00:01:41.091 --> 00:01:45.950
but I'm getting pretty sick and tired of all of these fake online

31
00:01:47.070 --> 00:01:49.190
business gurus. Trying to get me to this.

32
00:01:49.190 --> 00:01:51.590
<v 0>Guy. Watches copies of lot for sure. A hundred percent.</v>

33
00:01:51.590 --> 00:01:55.010
<v 1>Get registered for their webinars guys. I know you've been seeing the ad,</v>

34
00:01:55.011 --> 00:01:57.290
but I promise you if you just give me 60 seconds.

35
00:01:58.370 --> 00:02:00.470
<v 0>Okay? So then you give them 60 seconds, right?</v>

36
00:02:00.980 --> 00:02:03.110
You got to give them 60 seconds and you think, Oh man,

37
00:02:03.320 --> 00:02:06.050
he's not going to be like them. Right?

38
00:02:06.440 --> 00:02:08.930
<v 1>If you want to create a life, a better financial freedom,</v>

39
00:02:09.080 --> 00:02:11.270
live the life of your dreams and stop working a nine to five job.

40
00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:14.570
Stop doing all this stuff that you hate. Click the link around this video.

41
00:02:16.730 --> 00:02:19.370
<v 0>Sorry. We already went onto the next one. Hopes you guys have been spoiled,</v>

42
00:02:19.371 --> 00:02:23.900
but let me just say that. I'll just say just, just one word about that last guy,

43
00:02:24.530 --> 00:02:27.620
dude, you can't call out the gurus and then sell your webinar goats.

44
00:02:27.621 --> 00:02:30.980
So your free trading RO come to my free training. Come to my free training.

45
00:02:30.981 --> 00:02:31.940
Where so you on my course,

46
00:02:32.900 --> 00:02:37.850
what a joke are more scams out there on the internet than

47
00:02:37.880 --> 00:02:42.080
there are legitimate opportunities by far.

48
00:02:42.620 --> 00:02:43.730
Okay. Let's check out this.

49
00:02:45.980 --> 00:02:49.820
Cut to John [inaudible] selling scabs. Listen, let me say,

50
00:02:49.880 --> 00:02:53.270
let me say this about, uh, let me say this about that thing.

51
00:02:53.300 --> 00:02:55.400
Because I talked to John Crestani. I said,

52
00:02:55.401 --> 00:02:59.150
how much did it cost to get Chris Hansen on your show? He said 25,

53
00:02:59.890 --> 00:03:03.970
25 K to call out the gurus.

54
00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:07.420
Now this itself was a scam because you were supposed to buy a book,

55
00:03:07.421 --> 00:03:10.780
which is a $20 a month upsell for the book,

56
00:03:11.020 --> 00:03:15.760
a book that costs has a $20 a month subscription attached to it. But yeah,

57
00:03:15.790 --> 00:03:19.870
John, you just keep calling out the scammers buddy. Okay.

58
00:03:19.880 --> 00:03:23.740
Let's check out this method to literally copy and paste ads to make money.

59
00:03:23.770 --> 00:03:24.490
First off,

60
00:03:24.490 --> 00:03:28.300
you don't want to run a business where you have to actually like buy products

61
00:03:28.301 --> 00:03:30.700
and like ship them out to people. Okay?

62
00:03:30.880 --> 00:03:33.130
So let's forget about e-commerce drop shipping.

63
00:03:33.460 --> 00:03:34.780
I don't even know why I tried it.

64
00:03:34.810 --> 00:03:38.470
These guys make such better comedy than I ever could with these things.

65
00:03:39.340 --> 00:03:43.300
There are so many scams out there, but make bang. We're going to make bank,

66
00:03:43.390 --> 00:03:44.740
sell my product, work for it,

67
00:03:44.770 --> 00:03:48.250
search for my last name because the product we're going to be the product where

68
00:03:48.251 --> 00:03:49.084
we're going to be selling.

69
00:03:49.090 --> 00:03:52.360
It's actually my product selling is actually my product, unfortunately.

70
00:03:53.170 --> 00:03:57.400
All right. Next beam. I don't know. That's beauty pie, right? No. Nevermind. Uh,

71
00:03:57.430 --> 00:03:59.080
next guru.

72
00:03:59.210 --> 00:04:04.170
<v 2>I believe the world of e-commerce education is full of scammers pretenders and.</v>

73
00:04:04.440 --> 00:04:06.780
<v 0>Okay, hold on. I want to pause there cause it's going to be funny later.</v>

74
00:04:07.260 --> 00:04:10.980
He's saying that the baller busters are calling out the scammers. Okay?

75
00:04:10.981 --> 00:04:11.814
Remember that?

76
00:04:11.970 --> 00:04:12.803
<v 2>Right? Liars.</v>

77
00:04:12.930 --> 00:04:17.250
I'm sure you've seen their ads all over the place and I bet many of you have

78
00:04:17.251 --> 00:04:21.570
even been their victims for all of you gurus and self-proclaimed experts out

79
00:04:21.571 --> 00:04:24.180
there. You better watch out [inaudible].

80
00:04:24.900 --> 00:04:26.550
<v 0>Now when you go to bollard Buster's page,</v>

81
00:04:26.560 --> 00:04:28.860
remember this is the guy that's calling out the gurus,

82
00:04:28.861 --> 00:04:32.370
the Kevin's Ang endorses Kevin's Ang is one of their calls, dude.

83
00:04:32.520 --> 00:04:36.600
What is there? I am the show guy, little, a little,

84
00:04:36.601 --> 00:04:41.070
little CoLab with baller busters, but this is a long call out.

85
00:04:41.460 --> 00:04:44.160
I'll look, he's doing another e-commerce of 70% off.

86
00:04:44.190 --> 00:04:46.680
That was the scammy did last time. Where am I headed?

87
00:04:47.100 --> 00:04:49.350
And jail next year.

88
00:04:49.890 --> 00:04:54.180
<v 3>The stock market can be a very dangerous place. If you're following a fake,</v>

89
00:04:54.240 --> 00:04:57.030
if you're learning from a fake and because of this bull market,

90
00:04:57.031 --> 00:04:58.800
there are lots of fakes in this video.

91
00:04:58.860 --> 00:05:02.100
I'm going to talk about it and tell you how to expose a fake.

92
00:05:02.430 --> 00:05:07.080
<v 0>Ah, yes. Tim Sykes. The original huckster dude. Yes. So this video,</v>

93
00:05:07.081 --> 00:05:11.100
which is released recently called like calling out gurus or how to spot a fake

94
00:05:11.220 --> 00:05:13.950
you're real. It's all just him pitching his million dollar challenge.

95
00:05:14.130 --> 00:05:17.910
<v 3>I want to get into my millionaire challenge and you're ready to be taught by a</v>

96
00:05:17.911 --> 00:05:18.744
drill Sergeant.

97
00:05:18.900 --> 00:05:22.470
<v 0>Now, one of my favorite things about Tim Sykes, the millionaire trader is that,</v>

98
00:05:22.650 --> 00:05:27.570
uh, he's got verified trades on a platform called profit dot L Y

99
00:05:27.600 --> 00:05:30.360
or profitably. Now here's an interesting thing.

100
00:05:30.390 --> 00:05:35.220
Who verified Tim Sykes traits. Well profitably, but who owns profitably?

101
00:05:36.690 --> 00:05:41.160
Tim's hikes. That's right. Tim Sykes is verified. Tim Sykes trades.

102
00:05:41.250 --> 00:05:45.780
You better not call him a scam, dude. Hey, they're verified, verified by him.

103
00:05:45.900 --> 00:05:47.070
Okay. Next guru.

104
00:05:47.440 --> 00:05:50.820
<v 4>I see one more person on my Tik TOK timeline called professional advice because</v>

105
00:05:50.821 --> 00:05:54.510
Danny Devin thousands, or sometimes even knowing $2 in their Robin hood account,

106
00:05:54.690 --> 00:05:58.070
I swear I'm going to rip out my hair. Okay. D you CA you shouldn't be.

107
00:05:58.070 --> 00:06:01.280
<v 0>Able to teach. If you just have a thousand or a million dollars in your account,</v>

108
00:06:01.281 --> 00:06:04.880
you're saying don't fall for all these fake Robinhood gurus. Okay.

109
00:06:04.881 --> 00:06:07.640
So don't trust somebody just because they say they have millions of dollars in

110
00:06:07.641 --> 00:06:08.690
their stock market account.

111
00:06:09.160 --> 00:06:12.280
<v 5>Got it. I made a million dollars in four weeks,</v>

112
00:06:12.310 --> 00:06:13.690
and this is exactly how I did it.

113
00:06:17.740 --> 00:06:21.490
<v 0>This is by the way, like several months later after he calls out the gurus, Oh,</v>

114
00:06:21.520 --> 00:06:24.430
don't listen to all those other idiot gurus. Hey, by the way,

115
00:06:24.520 --> 00:06:25.570
I've made millions of dollars.

116
00:06:26.040 --> 00:06:29.860
<v 5>Start off with a thousand dollars, which I turned into 5,000, 5,000 to 10,000,</v>

117
00:06:29.861 --> 00:06:33.310
10,000 to 25,000, 25,000 to 50,000.

118
00:06:34.180 --> 00:06:36.820
<v 0>I believe at 50,000 into a million dollars. Hey,</v>

119
00:06:36.880 --> 00:06:39.640
and this is definitely not a demo account, not a demo account,

120
00:06:39.641 --> 00:06:42.850
but I turned a thousand dollars into a million dollars. Totally. Uh, yeah,

121
00:06:42.910 --> 00:06:45.910
this is very believable. Yeah. Just no big deal.

122
00:06:45.911 --> 00:06:48.760
A hundred thousand percent returns, that's it? Hey,

123
00:06:48.820 --> 00:06:50.380
a hundred thousand percent returns. What are you going to say?

124
00:06:50.381 --> 00:06:51.850
I'm lying next scam.

125
00:06:52.420 --> 00:06:55.000
<v 5>Mindset. You're doing that. And you're trying to scam people.</v>

126
00:06:55.090 --> 00:06:56.470
You don't have to go down that path.

127
00:06:57.130 --> 00:07:01.000
<v 0>This is a Tik TOK person named 11, not working, but what does she say?</v>

128
00:07:01.060 --> 00:07:04.300
Scammers need right mindset. That's right. If you're scamming,

129
00:07:04.390 --> 00:07:05.230
you got the wrong mindset.

130
00:07:05.530 --> 00:07:08.800
<v 5>Stay honest, stay true to yourself. You'll live a happier life.</v>

131
00:07:08.801 --> 00:07:12.100
You'll be able to sleep better at night. The good news is you can change,

132
00:07:12.130 --> 00:07:14.230
but unfortunately, no, that's a decision.

133
00:07:15.670 --> 00:07:19.630
<v 0>Oh, okay. So yeah. All you fakers out there.</v>

134
00:07:19.631 --> 00:07:23.440
All you scammers do the right thing. Don't, you know, stop scamming people.

135
00:07:24.640 --> 00:07:27.580
<v 5>How to get from a thousand dollars to a million dollars.</v>

136
00:07:27.680 --> 00:07:29.560
Check out the link in my bio for more.

137
00:07:30.160 --> 00:07:35.050
<v 0>Oh, a little course. Action there. Little, a 2% theory.</v>

138
00:07:35.080 --> 00:07:37.960
Yeah, just a thousand dollars to a million dollars. Two years.

139
00:07:37.961 --> 00:07:41.800
What's the big deal. Just trading crypto, baby. All right.

140
00:07:41.801 --> 00:07:43.450
And that's basically it. Yeah.

141
00:07:43.750 --> 00:07:45.670
I dunno what I'm going to do here on this channel.

142
00:07:46.300 --> 00:07:49.870
All the gurus are calling out all the gurus. I don't really know what to do.

143
00:07:49.871 --> 00:07:52.840
They're all saying, watch out for the vagaries as fake gurus.

144
00:07:52.960 --> 00:07:56.290
I honestly don't know where my place is anymore. I'm lost. I'm confused.

145
00:07:56.890 --> 00:07:59.620
Let me know what you think, guys. What do you think? Tell,

146
00:07:59.621 --> 00:08:01.900
let me know what you think of the studio. Two guys, we're slowly,

147
00:08:02.170 --> 00:08:06.970
we're building out our $10 million set. We're paying off the loan. Um,

148
00:08:07.030 --> 00:08:07.960
it's a massive loan.

149
00:08:08.050 --> 00:08:12.340
So if you haven't already go buy my fate guru spotter course for the low,

150
00:08:12.341 --> 00:08:17.050
low price of $10 million or $69 million. If you get the flash sale,

151
00:08:17.080 --> 00:08:18.850
which I'm only doing one time,

152
00:08:18.940 --> 00:08:22.090
which is this very second to the left first 500 people to click the link below.

153
00:08:22.420 --> 00:08:23.890
And, uh, that's basically it.
