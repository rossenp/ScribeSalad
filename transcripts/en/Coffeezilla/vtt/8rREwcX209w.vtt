00:00:00.300 --> 00:00:02.940
<v 0>Boys girls. I hope you're doing well. You know,</v>

2
00:00:02.941 --> 00:00:06.210
one of the interesting things about YouTube is my favorite type of content is

3
00:00:06.211 --> 00:00:09.060
when other YouTubers talk kind of, they break the fourth wall,

4
00:00:09.061 --> 00:00:12.450
talk about their inner thoughts. Talk about what they've been going through,

5
00:00:12.660 --> 00:00:15.990
but myself, I always find that to be so uninteresting on camera.

6
00:00:16.140 --> 00:00:18.420
We're going to try it anyways and look, if it doesn't work, Hey,

7
00:00:18.870 --> 00:00:21.030
we can just pretend this episode never happened.

8
00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:23.700
You and I won't speak of this again. We'll just,

9
00:00:24.030 --> 00:00:27.060
this'll be one of the great last episodes of coffees eligible, remove it.

10
00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:31.140
We'll banish it to the shadow realm and, uh, we'll just move on with their life.

11
00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:34.380
Okay. But I want to tell you guys something I've been thinking about,

12
00:00:34.381 --> 00:00:37.320
and it came from a conversation with Graham Stephan, look,

13
00:00:37.321 --> 00:00:40.260
you guys know I had him on my podcast, the drip Fridays,

14
00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:43.800
and he told me he came on my live stream and told me not to live stream anymore.

15
00:00:44.480 --> 00:00:45.410
One of the things I'll just tell you,

16
00:00:45.620 --> 00:00:49.070
one of the things that I think you're doing wrong from a growth perspective is

17
00:00:49.071 --> 00:00:52.310
doing live streams and long live streams like this lower,

18
00:00:52.311 --> 00:00:55.670
the overall click through rate. So very few people are unlike.

19
00:00:55.730 --> 00:00:58.100
Very few people are likely to go back and watch your live stream.

20
00:00:58.110 --> 00:01:01.490
So YouTube sees that as a discipline,

21
00:01:01.670 --> 00:01:04.460
like a not very performing video. So he says, look,

22
00:01:04.461 --> 00:01:08.840
just move the live stream to a different channel, better for you to do, right.

23
00:01:08.900 --> 00:01:12.380
Is you want to do live streams, make a second channel for that.

24
00:01:12.650 --> 00:01:15.020
And I think he's right. I'm going to try it out.

25
00:01:15.021 --> 00:01:18.260
I'm going to try it for like a month. See if I see any difference, if not,

26
00:01:18.261 --> 00:01:21.440
we'll move it back to the channel. But if you're a fan of the live stream,

27
00:01:21.441 --> 00:01:23.690
you should know we're moving it to the drip.

28
00:01:23.720 --> 00:01:25.610
It's a YouTube channel all on its own.

29
00:01:25.611 --> 00:01:28.190
I'm going to leave it first link in the description. Go subscribe.

30
00:01:28.430 --> 00:01:30.770
If you want to continue to be kept up to date with that,

31
00:01:30.800 --> 00:01:35.150
because here going forward, we're not having it hosted here on copies Ella.

32
00:01:35.210 --> 00:01:37.700
So go subscribe to the drip. We're going to have great guests.

33
00:01:37.820 --> 00:01:40.220
We've got Phillips solo TV coming on. It's going to be Epic.

34
00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:45.170
But that conversation got me thinking about something larger, which is change.

35
00:01:45.230 --> 00:01:47.360
It's been a thing I've been like experiencing.

36
00:01:47.361 --> 00:01:49.040
I'm talking to my friends a lot recently.

37
00:01:49.340 --> 00:01:53.090
A lot of my creative friends are feeling burnt out tired of the content they're

38
00:01:53.091 --> 00:01:55.700
producing tired of, you know, repeating themselves,

39
00:01:55.701 --> 00:01:59.510
tired of doing the same thing. And I wanted to put this out there,

40
00:01:59.570 --> 00:02:02.840
maybe even for myself a little bit. And some of you at home who are wondering,

41
00:02:02.900 --> 00:02:05.300
you know, what you should do if you're facing kind of a crossroads,

42
00:02:05.570 --> 00:02:08.000
I think life is about embracing change,

43
00:02:08.090 --> 00:02:10.490
which might sound a little cliche to say,

44
00:02:10.670 --> 00:02:15.170
but coupled with change is the fear and possibility of failure.

45
00:02:15.230 --> 00:02:18.620
So really what I'm saying is that life is about embracing failure.

46
00:02:18.740 --> 00:02:21.350
That's definitely been true of my life. I don't know if you guys know,

47
00:02:21.351 --> 00:02:24.740
but even the people who've been riding with me since coffee break days,

48
00:02:24.950 --> 00:02:29.810
like I tried so many things on YouTube. Even prior to that, you know,

49
00:02:29.811 --> 00:02:33.830
I've had a piano channel, I've had a Twitch channel where it get five viewers,

50
00:02:34.010 --> 00:02:37.100
you know, every night. And I stream for like three hours,

51
00:02:37.101 --> 00:02:40.670
the channel never took off. It died. It was a terrible idea from the start.

52
00:02:40.940 --> 00:02:43.610
You know, I ran an interview show that was like the start of coffees.

53
00:02:43.820 --> 00:02:46.520
Zillow was an interview show. I was going to interview video SAS.

54
00:02:46.760 --> 00:02:50.300
I was sure it was the next big thing that totally bombed.

55
00:02:50.390 --> 00:02:54.440
But I realized throwing those things against the wall and seeing them fail

56
00:02:54.500 --> 00:02:58.430
actually is what caused me to get to where I am today.

57
00:02:58.430 --> 00:03:02.950
And I couldn't have gotten here without basically making a series of

58
00:03:02.951 --> 00:03:07.150
failures that, you know, blew up in my face. They bombed at the time.

59
00:03:07.360 --> 00:03:10.540
And I think that's what everyone misses. They want to shortcut success.

60
00:03:10.720 --> 00:03:12.160
They want to avoid failure.

61
00:03:12.161 --> 00:03:14.920
And that's what keeps them from changing is because they think that by being

62
00:03:14.921 --> 00:03:18.370
smart, they can Dodge failure. But I don't think you can.

63
00:03:18.371 --> 00:03:22.540
I think it's the failures that make the successes, not the other way around.

64
00:03:22.541 --> 00:03:25.660
It's not like you endure failure until you hit success. No,

65
00:03:25.690 --> 00:03:28.330
the failure helps you learn how to be successful.

66
00:03:28.420 --> 00:03:30.670
So I wanted to say to you guys,

67
00:03:30.970 --> 00:03:34.900
don't be afraid about failing with change because you probably will like,

68
00:03:34.901 --> 00:03:38.830
honestly, most of the things that I've tried on this platform have bombed,

69
00:03:38.860 --> 00:03:41.770
but nobody ever remembers the bombs.

70
00:03:41.771 --> 00:03:45.610
Nobody ever remembers the fails that, well, maybe you guys do a little bit,

71
00:03:46.780 --> 00:03:49.420
but we can just make it an inside joke. That's fine.

72
00:03:49.570 --> 00:03:51.550
But the point is at the end of the day,

73
00:03:51.580 --> 00:03:55.780
people forget about that stuff and they just remember what you end up succeeding

74
00:03:55.781 --> 00:03:58.930
at. And that's something that I think about a lot. I, you know,

75
00:03:58.931 --> 00:04:02.680
I read this book called maiden America by Sam. Walton's the guy who, you know,

76
00:04:02.740 --> 00:04:03.700
made Walmart.

77
00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:08.470
And one of the really interesting things about him is like his biggest character

78
00:04:08.471 --> 00:04:12.790
trait that I think made him successful was he was obsessed with learning from

79
00:04:12.791 --> 00:04:16.690
his competitors. And just from people in general, like in the book,

80
00:04:16.720 --> 00:04:19.210
he's at the top of his game, he's, you know,

81
00:04:19.270 --> 00:04:23.980
the King of Walmart is stores everywhere and he's still going into other

82
00:04:23.981 --> 00:04:27.100
people's grocery stores and like looking at what are they doing?

83
00:04:27.310 --> 00:04:29.860
What are they doing successfully? What are they doing better than me?

84
00:04:30.010 --> 00:04:33.610
He's like measuring the distance between their stalls because he likes the flow

85
00:04:33.611 --> 00:04:36.520
of traffic better than at his Walmart. I mean,

86
00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:41.260
his obsession with growth never stopped even when he was at the top,

87
00:04:41.290 --> 00:04:45.190
even when he could have gotten complacent or he could be thinking, you know,

88
00:04:45.191 --> 00:04:48.520
I'm at the top, I have the most to lose by changing and failing.

89
00:04:48.790 --> 00:04:52.870
And that's the thing that impressed me the most is just his attitude towards

90
00:04:52.871 --> 00:04:56.410
change. And it's what I try to do as well. Dude, I sound like,

91
00:04:57.460 --> 00:05:00.490
I sound like an inspirational guru right now. I swear I'm not,

92
00:05:00.520 --> 00:05:01.870
this is just actually true.

93
00:05:02.140 --> 00:05:04.660
This is really what I believe about the world is that, um,

94
00:05:04.720 --> 00:05:08.980
when you stop trying new things is the exact second that you stop getting

95
00:05:08.981 --> 00:05:13.090
better. You stopped growing and I've seen so many other YouTubers do it.

96
00:05:13.091 --> 00:05:16.510
Like you see them grow. And when they get that big audience,

97
00:05:16.750 --> 00:05:18.280
you see them get paralyzed.

98
00:05:18.520 --> 00:05:21.880
I know you guys can think of one or two creators right now who this has happened

99
00:05:21.881 --> 00:05:22.390
to.

100
00:05:22.390 --> 00:05:26.620
And they just keep doing the same content that got them successful five years

101
00:05:26.621 --> 00:05:30.010
ago, because they're simply afraid to grow. They're afraid to, you know,

102
00:05:30.011 --> 00:05:32.020
stop doing what has always worked for them.

103
00:05:32.260 --> 00:05:33.880
And I think you can't be afraid of that.

104
00:05:33.881 --> 00:05:35.770
And that's really something I try to remember.

105
00:05:35.920 --> 00:05:38.800
And it's what I think about when Graham gives me advice like that. Hey, stop,

106
00:05:38.801 --> 00:05:41.200
live streaming. Maybe he's right. Let's try it out.

107
00:05:41.201 --> 00:05:43.720
Let's move it to another channel for 30 days. What's the harm.

108
00:05:43.750 --> 00:05:46.180
Worst thing that happens. It flops. Honestly,

109
00:05:46.210 --> 00:05:48.730
nobody's going to remember it five months from now. No,

110
00:05:48.731 --> 00:05:52.210
one's going to remember that we took a month to go put it on the other channel.

111
00:05:52.211 --> 00:05:53.260
It doesn't matter.

112
00:05:53.740 --> 00:05:56.920
So I don't know if there's some of you out there that need to hear this advice.

113
00:05:57.110 --> 00:06:01.250
Now I know. I definitely need to be reminded of it sometimes. So, um, yeah.

114
00:06:01.310 --> 00:06:04.820
I hope you guys enjoyed this little rant. That's what I've been thinking about,

115
00:06:05.720 --> 00:06:10.010
uh, how you can change big and small, because let me give you a little secret.

116
00:06:10.400 --> 00:06:13.520
We're about to make a big change that the live streaming is a small thing.

117
00:06:13.790 --> 00:06:18.590
We're on the come up of a big change with a $10 million studio about to be

118
00:06:18.591 --> 00:06:20.720
completed. I know I've been talking about it forever guys.

119
00:06:20.750 --> 00:06:23.930
It's around the corner before the new year. I think we'll have it for you guys,

120
00:06:24.290 --> 00:06:26.480
but we're about to make a giant change to content.

121
00:06:26.600 --> 00:06:30.620
And I hope you guys roll with me on that because I promise you one thing I won't

122
00:06:30.621 --> 00:06:35.570
stop trying to improve. We won't stop making this community better,

123
00:06:35.600 --> 00:06:38.840
more fun, have bigger and better videos for you guys. Um,

124
00:06:38.870 --> 00:06:43.070
so thanks for riding with me so far, guys. I, I hope we can go even further.

125
00:06:43.100 --> 00:06:43.933
See you next time.

126
00:06:44.440 --> 00:06:47.950
<v 1>It was always smash like, and subscribe. Thank you.</v>
