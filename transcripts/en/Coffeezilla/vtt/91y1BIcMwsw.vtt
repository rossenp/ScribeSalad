00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:02.820
<v 0>What up guys? It never fails to surprise.</v>

2
00:00:02.820 --> 00:00:04.830
<v 1>Me how awful.</v>

3
00:00:05.340 --> 00:00:07.170
<v 0>Instagram influencers are.</v>

4
00:00:07.320 --> 00:00:10.380
And I feel like this story really sums up everything that I hate about

5
00:00:10.381 --> 00:00:15.270
Instagram. Uh, it's all these fake influencers living fake lives.

6
00:00:15.450 --> 00:00:17.370
Nothing's real. The house is rented.

7
00:00:17.371 --> 00:00:21.840
The land was rented and they make you feel bad because you're working your nine

8
00:00:21.841 --> 00:00:24.240
to five, you got more money than they do. You don't even know that,

9
00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:25.830
but you're looking at them like, wow.

10
00:00:25.880 --> 00:00:28.250
<v 1>Wow, he's got a Lambo. She bought a Lamborghini.</v>

11
00:00:29.540 --> 00:00:32.450
How come everyone has lamb bows? Oh, incredible.

12
00:00:32.630 --> 00:00:37.190
<v 0>Everyone buys their Lambo. No, they're all rented. The house is rented.</v>

13
00:00:37.191 --> 00:00:41.300
The land was rented. The lifestyle. Isn't real. I keep telling you guys that,

14
00:00:41.301 --> 00:00:44.900
but I want to start highlighting it. So this is the first in a series.

15
00:00:44.901 --> 00:00:48.320
Maybe I'm horrible, Instagram or something like that. All right.

16
00:00:48.321 --> 00:00:51.020
So to cover this real quick, this trader, uh,

17
00:00:51.050 --> 00:00:53.720
he calls himself a Wolf trader claims.

18
00:00:53.721 --> 00:00:58.340
He can't repay his mom $750,000 because he has to maintain his

19
00:00:58.341 --> 00:01:02.960
social media in an extraordinary rant about his love of clothes and watches.

20
00:01:03.050 --> 00:01:07.910
Okay. So let's break this down. This is the person we're talking about today.

21
00:01:08.030 --> 00:01:12.800
Tyson Schultz better known as eight S X Wolf on Instagram.

22
00:01:12.801 --> 00:01:16.400
He had 15,000 followers before he deleted his social media,

23
00:01:16.610 --> 00:01:19.370
following the fallout of all this. But here's what happened.

24
00:01:20.090 --> 00:01:23.240
He had a bunch of subway shops that he owned with his mom.

25
00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:25.070
His mom spent her life savings,

26
00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:29.660
basically half a million dollars on a subway shop to own with her son.

27
00:01:30.110 --> 00:01:34.850
Now, the son managed everything and put it in his own name rather than his mom's

28
00:01:34.851 --> 00:01:36.920
name. So she invested her life savings.

29
00:01:37.250 --> 00:01:41.060
This guy's mom's life savings to be clear, he keeps it under his own name.

30
00:01:41.061 --> 00:01:44.720
Finally, she files a lawsuit, not the same time that's happening. This.

31
00:01:44.721 --> 00:01:48.920
Guy's trying to project an image on Instagram that he's this ball or he's living

32
00:01:48.921 --> 00:01:50.600
this crazy lifestyle, right?

33
00:01:50.660 --> 00:01:54.440
Here's a few pictures from his now deleted Instagram. Uh,

34
00:01:54.470 --> 00:01:57.530
he's writing speed boats. You know, he's got a helicopter.

35
00:01:57.531 --> 00:02:02.090
He's just living the jet set lifestyle all while not paying his mom. Okay.

36
00:02:02.570 --> 00:02:07.250
So he's posting this lifestyle and then trying to sell stock tips alongside of

37
00:02:07.310 --> 00:02:07.340
it.

38
00:02:07.340 --> 00:02:11.240
His excuse basically is the reason I can afford all this stuff is because I'm an

39
00:02:11.300 --> 00:02:15.530
expert stock trader. Okay, look, this is the stuff you would post bought me.

40
00:02:15.531 --> 00:02:19.730
A new toy trading has been great for the first half of 2018 while January.

41
00:02:19.731 --> 00:02:23.060
Anyway. So he's saying I bought this Lamborghini. Okay.

42
00:02:23.360 --> 00:02:28.010
And then he tries to sell basically stock tips on top of that $500 for this tip,

43
00:02:28.400 --> 00:02:30.230
because it has the bones to make five to 10 X money.

44
00:02:30.620 --> 00:02:33.470
So that's the backdrop to this story. Okay?

45
00:02:33.950 --> 00:02:36.890
He's saying he's got a great lifestyle, whatever, whatever, whatever, meanwhile,

46
00:02:36.891 --> 00:02:40.790
he's not paying his mom allegedly. So finally she sues cause she realizes, okay,

47
00:02:40.791 --> 00:02:43.820
I'm not getting paid. She invested apparently in 2013,

48
00:02:44.030 --> 00:02:46.370
500 grand and never got ownership.

49
00:02:46.490 --> 00:02:49.790
So she sues him and the court rules in her favor. They say,

50
00:02:49.910 --> 00:02:53.330
you got to pay your mom back $750,000. And this.

51
00:02:55.010 --> 00:02:55.850
<v 1>Ladies and gentlemen.</v>

52
00:02:57.410 --> 00:03:00.790
<v 0>Is when the house of cards begins to fall. Allegedly,</v>

53
00:03:00.820 --> 00:03:04.360
after he was told to pay $750,000 to his mother,

54
00:03:05.430 --> 00:03:09.540
he says he doesn't have it. He doesn't have the money. In fact, he says,

55
00:03:09.660 --> 00:03:14.550
he's on unemployment benefits with the declared income of 44 cents

56
00:03:14.700 --> 00:03:18.450
a fortnight. Now, if you're like me and you don't know what a fortnight is,

57
00:03:18.630 --> 00:03:21.600
you have to look it up. I'll save you the time. It means every two weeks.

58
00:03:21.930 --> 00:03:26.520
So he's basically making a dollar a month. No,

59
00:03:26.521 --> 00:03:29.910
that's probably not true. He's just probably trying to get away from, you know,

60
00:03:29.911 --> 00:03:30.780
paying his mom.

61
00:03:30.840 --> 00:03:34.540
But isn't it funny that this stock guru who's like posing in front of the

62
00:03:34.740 --> 00:03:37.860
helicopter? You know, he's saying, Oh, I bought the Lambo, bro.

63
00:03:37.861 --> 00:03:39.870
You're not making a dollar a month.

64
00:03:40.560 --> 00:03:44.610
And at the court hearing where basically his mom and him are fighting it out for

65
00:03:44.611 --> 00:03:47.850
her life savings. He's like, no, mom, I can't pay you back your life.

66
00:03:50.160 --> 00:03:52.320
Apparently, uh, he released some board damning evidence.

67
00:03:53.340 --> 00:03:58.260
He said that he needs 2,500 a week to keep maintaining his life,

68
00:03:58.800 --> 00:04:02.340
dial for the image for the gram dude, you gotta do it for the gram.

69
00:04:02.880 --> 00:04:05.640
I can't be an influencer on a, on a dollar a month.

70
00:04:05.790 --> 00:04:07.650
You got to have $2,500 a week.

71
00:04:08.040 --> 00:04:12.450
Mr. Schultz said he liked to dine out and buy clothes because quote,

72
00:04:12.570 --> 00:04:14.850
that is what social media is about.

73
00:04:17.430 --> 00:04:21.300
Listen, guys, we've ruined a generation. We've taught them.

74
00:04:21.301 --> 00:04:22.680
That image means everything.

75
00:04:22.681 --> 00:04:26.760
When actually it couldn't matter less being owning a Lambo,

76
00:04:26.761 --> 00:04:29.100
having the image. Does it make you a better trader?

77
00:04:29.370 --> 00:04:31.710
But ultimately it doesn't matter. This guy's not actually trying to trade.

78
00:04:31.711 --> 00:04:34.050
He's just trying to get sell stock tips.

79
00:04:34.350 --> 00:04:36.930
And he's doing that by pretending to be balling.

80
00:04:37.110 --> 00:04:39.960
If I go and buy a watch tomorrow, a $50,000 watch,

81
00:04:39.990 --> 00:04:42.780
I have to keep maintaining the lifestyle for the image,

82
00:04:42.810 --> 00:04:46.770
for the selling of the stuff. So he's admitting, Hey,

83
00:04:46.830 --> 00:04:51.390
the only way I can sell is if I pretend that pretend that my life is so great me

84
00:04:51.630 --> 00:04:53.220
while you're not even paying your own mother,

85
00:04:53.790 --> 00:04:57.990
this is what's so bad about Instagram and these

86
00:04:58.140 --> 00:05:02.610
influencers who their whole life is built around and their success

87
00:05:02.890 --> 00:05:06.660
brand is all built around being something that they're not,

88
00:05:07.320 --> 00:05:12.000
and also projecting a false lifestyle on to a bunch of followers

89
00:05:12.090 --> 00:05:16.350
who are impressionable, who were like, Hey, how do I become like a ESX Wolf?

90
00:05:16.530 --> 00:05:17.370
What a baller.

91
00:05:17.580 --> 00:05:21.960
But I think the good news and what you can always kind of rely on these people.

92
00:05:22.110 --> 00:05:25.380
They never really get away with it forever. They may get away with it for sure.

93
00:05:25.381 --> 00:05:28.710
A little while. It's like gambles area, right? Dan Bilzerian did this.

94
00:05:28.711 --> 00:05:30.720
He did it much better than this guy,

95
00:05:31.170 --> 00:05:34.410
but it's falling apart and it's falling apart for this guy too. I mean,

96
00:05:34.411 --> 00:05:37.920
it turns out the Lamborghini that he said he bought. Do you remember that?

97
00:05:38.100 --> 00:05:41.040
He said, bought me a new toy. Yeah. Turns out it was a rental.

98
00:05:41.130 --> 00:05:45.120
Despite him saying that he paid more than $300,000 for the car.

99
00:05:45.360 --> 00:05:48.210
Apparently in the transcript,

100
00:05:48.510 --> 00:05:51.210
he said he only owned the number. Play.

101
00:05:53.340 --> 00:05:56.250
The only part the Lambo he owned was the license plate.

102
00:05:56.960 --> 00:06:00.920
And I'll just add this in because it's some good shot in Freud, dude,

103
00:06:01.190 --> 00:06:05.360
that Lamborghini that he had was actually seized earlier this year because he

104
00:06:05.361 --> 00:06:07.520
was speeding around, uh, Australia.

105
00:06:07.820 --> 00:06:12.050
And I think he was taking video of himself speeding. But yeah, his, his,

106
00:06:12.500 --> 00:06:14.390
his car got repossessed earlier this year.

107
00:06:14.720 --> 00:06:17.690
Now that basically covers the daily mail side of the story.

108
00:06:18.230 --> 00:06:22.670
But there's more to it guys because there's a Twitter user by the handle of

109
00:06:22.790 --> 00:06:27.680
stock Swami that has been following Tyson Schultz for a long time.

110
00:06:27.681 --> 00:06:31.940
And he's been basically busting open this case way before it ever hit the

111
00:06:31.941 --> 00:06:33.320
presses or anything like that.

112
00:06:33.530 --> 00:06:36.410
So I got to give a quick shout out to him cause he's done some great job in

113
00:06:36.411 --> 00:06:38.960
documenting the stuff worth noting right at the top,

114
00:06:38.990 --> 00:06:42.950
is that a stock Swami got the permission of Tyson's family to share this

115
00:06:42.951 --> 00:06:45.170
information because even though it's public information,

116
00:06:45.171 --> 00:06:49.190
it's also sort of personal information as well. Now with that out of the way,

117
00:06:49.220 --> 00:06:53.810
let's get into the most, I think damning part of this whole thread,

118
00:06:53.811 --> 00:06:57.680
it's a long thread. Uh, I'll link it below so you can go follow stock Swami.

119
00:06:58.070 --> 00:07:02.750
But one of the big things is that someone from the subway reached out the

120
00:07:02.751 --> 00:07:07.100
area manager okay. Of the sip, subway franchises, uh,

121
00:07:07.130 --> 00:07:10.760
they reached out and apparently she was the manager for four years.

122
00:07:10.761 --> 00:07:14.720
I currently work with his wife, not an ex-wife because he won't sign the papers.

123
00:07:15.050 --> 00:07:18.170
He did have five stores and a massive empire. So he was like,

124
00:07:18.171 --> 00:07:20.750
he owned a bunch of franchises and threw all that away,

125
00:07:20.780 --> 00:07:24.830
left his misses with Jack at an over $200,000 of debt,

126
00:07:24.860 --> 00:07:27.260
which we are slowly paying back and rebuilding. Yes,

127
00:07:27.261 --> 00:07:30.350
he left her with a million dollar business, but he left her in a lot of debt.

128
00:07:30.440 --> 00:07:33.290
He refuses to see his daughter because he's too busy partying.

129
00:07:33.470 --> 00:07:36.500
I've seen the messages, heard the calls and dealt with him firsthand.

130
00:07:36.680 --> 00:07:39.500
It's up to him, how he lives and continues on with his life.

131
00:07:39.710 --> 00:07:44.060
But it's all for attention and social media, if he's happy, then so be it.

132
00:07:44.061 --> 00:07:47.690
But there's no way he can say he left his wife better off or it was good for her

133
00:07:47.691 --> 00:07:48.710
because that is complete.

134
00:07:49.850 --> 00:07:53.150
The man I used to idolize looked up to very quickly turned into a man.

135
00:07:53.151 --> 00:07:55.850
You wouldn't want to know. So this is crazy. I mean,

136
00:07:55.880 --> 00:07:59.960
so not only the moms involved, the wife's involved,

137
00:07:59.990 --> 00:08:03.560
it gets really personal and nasty. There's bad checks going around.

138
00:08:03.680 --> 00:08:05.690
The point is this guys, what's the lesson.

139
00:08:06.470 --> 00:08:11.090
The lesson is that Instagram is not real life and you can throw

140
00:08:11.091 --> 00:08:13.670
away your real life for a fake life.

141
00:08:14.120 --> 00:08:16.460
This is sort of the story of Tyson.

142
00:08:17.030 --> 00:08:21.110
It's a story of a man who wanted fame so badly that he gave up a successful

143
00:08:21.111 --> 00:08:26.060
business and actually successful, you know, relationships all for the fame,

144
00:08:26.061 --> 00:08:29.150
for the clout, the gram. So that's basically it.

145
00:08:29.151 --> 00:08:30.680
I hope you've learned something here.

146
00:08:30.710 --> 00:08:34.130
If you have someone you'd like to nominate for a horrible Instagram video,

147
00:08:34.160 --> 00:08:36.980
let me know, looking for all fakes and frauds.

148
00:08:37.160 --> 00:08:39.110
Cause this stuff's out of control, man. We got to call it out.

149
00:08:39.280 --> 00:08:43.570
<v 2>And don't forget to smash like and subscribe. Thank you.</v>
