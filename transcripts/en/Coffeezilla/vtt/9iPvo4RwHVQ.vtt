00:00:00.060 --> 00:00:00.631
<v 0>Ladies and gentlemen,</v>

2
00:00:00.631 --> 00:00:05.160
today we are uncovering quite possibly the largest giveaway scam in history.

3
00:00:05.161 --> 00:00:09.450
And the crazy thing is that it's still going on right now.

4
00:00:09.510 --> 00:00:13.080
As we speak guys, I am talking of course,

5
00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:15.810
about Instagrammer, Jay magaziney.

6
00:00:16.290 --> 00:00:20.100
Now I'll introduce you to this guy. I'll give you everything to first.

7
00:00:20.101 --> 00:00:23.070
Let me say he's, uh, he's very requested. And, uh,

8
00:00:23.071 --> 00:00:25.860
I actually put together something for you guys. Let's watch.

9
00:00:26.210 --> 00:00:27.043
<v 1>Just</v>

10
00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:36.890
to give you this food. Everybody that got

11
00:00:44.540 --> 00:00:44.630
[inaudible].

12
00:00:44.630 --> 00:00:47.630
<v 0>This is the side that Jay magaziney wants you to see.</v>

13
00:00:48.200 --> 00:00:51.680
He has a bunch of posts on his Instagram, everywhere,

14
00:00:51.860 --> 00:00:54.740
where he's giving away money and he wants to be seen like that.

15
00:00:54.741 --> 00:00:59.510
He wants to be seen like, sort of like a Mr. B's 2.0, Mr. Altruism.

16
00:00:59.540 --> 00:01:01.580
He's constantly giving away money.

17
00:01:01.640 --> 00:01:05.600
But the question is where did he get this money to be giving away to everyone?

18
00:01:05.930 --> 00:01:06.980
Well, he'll tell you,

19
00:01:06.981 --> 00:01:11.960
he owns an Academy where he teaches trading and he also owns a clothing

20
00:01:11.961 --> 00:01:13.850
company called Masini Italy.

21
00:01:14.360 --> 00:01:17.150
<v 1>I got a clothing line. I got an Academy.</v>

22
00:01:17.720 --> 00:01:20.540
We felt we keep stocks.

23
00:01:20.870 --> 00:01:22.070
<v 0>Now, according to him,</v>

24
00:01:22.250 --> 00:01:25.970
the clothing company alone is worth $8 million.

25
00:01:26.150 --> 00:01:29.960
Pretty impressive for an influencer who has 1 million followers.

26
00:01:29.990 --> 00:01:33.350
Most people on Instagram who have 1 million followers are making a decent

27
00:01:33.351 --> 00:01:36.320
living, but they're not making anywhere near $8 million.

28
00:01:36.470 --> 00:01:40.430
<v 1>$8 Million net worth. This is what the company's estimated up.</v>

29
00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:42.290
<v 0>When you start digging deeper,</v>

30
00:01:42.320 --> 00:01:46.100
we find out why Jay Masini is getting so many orders on it.

31
00:01:46.670 --> 00:01:48.530
<v 1>This is going to be a mystery box,</v>

32
00:01:48.620 --> 00:01:53.450
minimum order of three MSI products in order to win in order to win

33
00:01:54.470 --> 00:01:58.730
maybe $10,000, maybe 20,000, maybe 30,000.

34
00:01:58.880 --> 00:02:03.230
<v 0>See, this is how Jamie Zeni really makes his money.</v>

35
00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:08.480
He does giveaways where he will say for the next X number of orders,

36
00:02:08.750 --> 00:02:13.010
I'll be giving you back money. And it's not like an insignificant amount.

37
00:02:13.040 --> 00:02:15.500
This is often life-changing amounts of money,

38
00:02:15.830 --> 00:02:19.570
but the requirement is you have to buy products from his site.

39
00:02:20.150 --> 00:02:24.590
Magaziney italy.com in order to enter to win. Now on the FTCs own website,

40
00:02:24.620 --> 00:02:28.040
they say the signs of a prize scam is that number one,

41
00:02:28.041 --> 00:02:30.470
you have to pay legitimate sweepstakes.

42
00:02:30.500 --> 00:02:33.320
Don't make you pay a fee or buy something.

43
00:02:33.470 --> 00:02:37.580
This is in contrast to what J Masini does. He forces you to buy his products?

44
00:02:37.610 --> 00:02:41.600
Oftentimes he says, you know, Oh, you have to buy five items, seven items,

45
00:02:41.601 --> 00:02:46.340
10 items from my site, but he's keeps saying you're going to win a ton of money.

46
00:02:46.341 --> 00:02:50.810
And guys it's a lot. So here's just a few of them.

47
00:02:51.530 --> 00:02:56.000
<v 1>Thousand orders. I'll be placing in $12,000 in each order.</v>

48
00:02:56.990 --> 00:03:00.880
<v 0>Thousand dollars. Okay. $12,000 pay attention, minimum.</v>

49
00:03:00.880 --> 00:03:03.220
<v 1>Order, six misogyny, Italy products.</v>

50
00:03:03.370 --> 00:03:06.970
This is another one for the next 300 magaziney Italy orders.

51
00:03:07.540 --> 00:03:10.600
I'll be placing it $40,000 in each order.

52
00:03:11.130 --> 00:03:14.160
<v 0>Okay. Think about that for 300 orders,</v>

53
00:03:14.161 --> 00:03:16.530
he's going to place $40,000 in each one.

54
00:03:17.400 --> 00:03:22.230
And I know most of you guys already smell a gigantic scale, right? Obviously,

55
00:03:22.620 --> 00:03:27.120
but he insists it's real guys. It's real. And let's do the math here. Okay.

56
00:03:27.450 --> 00:03:28.710
I went and I checked.

57
00:03:28.860 --> 00:03:32.820
What's the most Jamison he could be making off of this little little thing,

58
00:03:32.970 --> 00:03:37.560
right? Let's say you buy the most expensive thing on his site. Well,

59
00:03:37.561 --> 00:03:40.380
according to his own slider in the all item section,

60
00:03:40.590 --> 00:03:44.910
most expensive product is $85. You're paying $85.

61
00:03:44.940 --> 00:03:46.320
And minimum order is.

62
00:03:46.440 --> 00:03:49.350
<v 1>Minimum. Order is not magaziney Italy products.</v>

63
00:03:49.380 --> 00:03:53.790
<v 0>So the max you can make per person is $765. And this guy is saying,</v>

64
00:03:53.940 --> 00:03:57.750
he's going to give away $40,000 to each of those people.

65
00:03:57.930 --> 00:04:02.790
Meaning he's running at a net loss of $39,000

66
00:04:02.820 --> 00:04:06.180
per customer. That's what he's saying. That's the math.

67
00:04:06.210 --> 00:04:09.990
What comes next then should come as literally a surprise to know when people

68
00:04:09.991 --> 00:04:13.440
start coming out of the word work saying that they were told by Jane Masini that

69
00:04:13.620 --> 00:04:15.570
they won. And then they never got money.

70
00:04:15.660 --> 00:04:17.790
<v 2>I wasn't alive with Jim Azimi.</v>

71
00:04:18.540 --> 00:04:22.710
She told me I won $2,000, a house screen recorded and everything.

72
00:04:23.520 --> 00:04:27.090
Now I am I supposed to believe one.

73
00:04:27.630 --> 00:04:29.100
I was alive and I still didn't want it.

74
00:04:29.700 --> 00:04:31.920
<v 0>Of course, nothing's in the bags guys. I mean,</v>

75
00:04:31.921 --> 00:04:33.480
this should not come as a surprise to anyone.

76
00:04:33.481 --> 00:04:37.920
You literally cannot do this giveaway. It's impossible. So what does this mean?

77
00:04:37.950 --> 00:04:40.950
It means that if James and he's telling the truth and his clothing lines worth

78
00:04:40.980 --> 00:04:41.850
$8 million,

79
00:04:42.570 --> 00:04:46.800
he basically created that from nothing by telling people he's going to give away

80
00:04:46.801 --> 00:04:51.330
all this money by lying to them. And how does he do it? Remember, again,

81
00:04:51.570 --> 00:04:53.010
it all goes back to the beginning,

82
00:04:53.310 --> 00:04:56.430
this image that he's cultivating isn't on accident.

83
00:04:56.730 --> 00:04:59.970
He wants to be known as the guy who gives away money, right?

84
00:05:00.090 --> 00:05:02.100
This is what he wants to be seen doing.

85
00:05:02.130 --> 00:05:03.690
<v 2>I just wanted to give you this for you.</v>

86
00:05:05.130 --> 00:05:07.140
<v 0>This is all a facade though.</v>

87
00:05:07.170 --> 00:05:10.290
Literally he's doing this so that you believe in what he says.

88
00:05:10.350 --> 00:05:14.700
I'll give you $40,000. I'll give you $12,000. I'll give you $10,000,

89
00:05:15.300 --> 00:05:16.950
but it's not true. And ladies and gentlemen,

90
00:05:16.951 --> 00:05:20.880
there's been an undercurrent of dissatisfied customers that have swept through

91
00:05:20.881 --> 00:05:24.240
to the point where he's getting banned from various payment platforms.

92
00:05:24.241 --> 00:05:27.780
Like he even got banned from PayPal. He no longer can use PayPal,

93
00:05:27.781 --> 00:05:30.510
which is why he uses Zelle now. But in his Instagram story,

94
00:05:30.511 --> 00:05:34.020
he's seen trying to buy a fresh PayPal because he got banned.

95
00:05:34.320 --> 00:05:35.610
Look who has a PayPal.

96
00:05:35.611 --> 00:05:38.730
They want to sell a business PayPal with a good reputation in history.

97
00:05:39.090 --> 00:05:40.980
Basically he needs a business PayPal.

98
00:05:40.981 --> 00:05:43.980
So he wants to buy one because he got banned from his current one because the

99
00:05:44.400 --> 00:05:47.490
charge backs and the refunds that people are going through are insane.

100
00:05:47.520 --> 00:05:51.330
But this is just further evidence of the scam it's falling apart.

101
00:05:51.570 --> 00:05:56.160
This is to the point where he's even had to address and make up excuses for why

102
00:05:56.161 --> 00:05:57.380
people aren't getting their money.

103
00:05:57.740 --> 00:06:01.190
So one of the things he set out to do now is that the money which he's

104
00:06:01.191 --> 00:06:03.050
supposedly sending in the mail,

105
00:06:03.170 --> 00:06:08.060
he says he puts $40,000 or $10,000 into packages, physical packages.

106
00:06:08.061 --> 00:06:12.170
He ships out to people. He says that the post office is stealing from them.

107
00:06:12.470 --> 00:06:15.830
Postal workers are destroying boxes and taking the prizes.

108
00:06:15.890 --> 00:06:19.850
And then they blame Jay for not getting the prize. So he's saying,

109
00:06:20.180 --> 00:06:24.290
it's not my fault. You didn't get paid. Hey, ups stole money, stole your money.

110
00:06:24.440 --> 00:06:27.410
And guys, that's not the only time he's addressed at sea. Jamie.

111
00:06:27.800 --> 00:06:32.360
Zeni also went on bars on [inaudible] and addressed it there as well.

112
00:06:33.220 --> 00:06:37.150
<v 3>I went through a lot of accusations. I've done a lot for the community.</v>

113
00:06:37.151 --> 00:06:39.430
I know some people are selfish. They won't even do enough.

114
00:06:39.670 --> 00:06:41.230
They won't even do nothing for anybody.

115
00:06:41.920 --> 00:06:43.120
<v 0>All right, guys, quit being selfish,</v>

116
00:06:43.150 --> 00:06:47.260
give away $40,000 to the next 300 people like Jay Manzini,

117
00:06:47.560 --> 00:06:50.620
by the way, that's a giveaway of $12 million.

118
00:06:50.650 --> 00:06:54.610
Keep in mind that this clown says his whole company is worth $8 million.

119
00:06:54.640 --> 00:06:58.450
Although he doesn't have the cash in one giveaway, he promised $12 million.

120
00:06:58.480 --> 00:06:58.870
But yeah,

121
00:06:58.870 --> 00:07:02.350
he's a guy who does stuff for the community as opposed to selfish people.

122
00:07:02.770 --> 00:07:05.080
<v 3>I don't see bill Gates doing nothing for the community.</v>

123
00:07:07.360 --> 00:07:09.250
<v 0>I'm not even going to get into this one.</v>

124
00:07:09.520 --> 00:07:11.830
Bill Gates has been taking a little heat online lately.

125
00:07:11.860 --> 00:07:15.850
But to say that bill Gates doesn't do anything for the community while you do.

126
00:07:18.040 --> 00:07:21.670
Yeah. Uh, this guy's clueless maybe because bill Gates, isn't going on.

127
00:07:21.671 --> 00:07:24.610
Instagram live bragging. Every time he gives away money,

128
00:07:24.611 --> 00:07:27.070
maybe that's why you don't see him as doing anything for the community.

129
00:07:27.071 --> 00:07:27.904
I don't know.

130
00:07:28.960 --> 00:07:31.840
<v 3>Well, I'm telling you one thing, bro. There's a lot of people.</v>

131
00:07:32.260 --> 00:07:35.200
When I launched my brand, I did giveaways.

132
00:07:35.860 --> 00:07:40.690
<v 0>This gets into his biggest excuse and the biggest load of garbage you</v>

133
00:07:40.691 --> 00:07:42.610
will ever hear in your life. Okay?

134
00:07:42.640 --> 00:07:45.100
This is how he reconciles not paying people money.

135
00:07:45.580 --> 00:07:48.250
<v 3>And then a lot of people lost at the end of the day. You're getting the product.</v>

136
00:07:48.280 --> 00:07:50.410
<v 0>Right? Let's hear that again. A lot of.</v>

137
00:07:50.410 --> 00:07:52.420
<v 3>People want a lot of people lost at the end of the day,</v>

138
00:07:52.421 --> 00:07:54.190
you're getting a product one more time.

139
00:07:55.630 --> 00:07:58.600
<v 0>What? I didn't pay you $40,000.</v>

140
00:07:59.320 --> 00:08:02.380
You bought the clothes cause you just wanted the clothes. No,

141
00:08:02.500 --> 00:08:05.770
they bought your products because they wanted the money.

142
00:08:06.040 --> 00:08:09.760
It's not at the end of the day. If you didn't win, you got a product.

143
00:08:09.910 --> 00:08:14.020
No you're robbing people because the only reason they're going in and buying

144
00:08:14.021 --> 00:08:16.840
your crappy clothes is because they want money.

145
00:08:16.841 --> 00:08:19.000
It's not because they're in love with the [inaudible] brand.

146
00:08:19.060 --> 00:08:21.730
He says this all the time. By the way, this is his big excuse.

147
00:08:21.940 --> 00:08:24.880
He goes on entire rant about how he doesn't owe you anything.

148
00:08:25.300 --> 00:08:30.190
<v 3>Yeah. I'm in the house scam in the house. I got a clothing line.</v>

149
00:08:30.580 --> 00:08:35.140
I got an Academy. We sell clothes. We fix stocks.

150
00:08:35.560 --> 00:08:39.280
You call it the brand of scam. Why? Because I can't give everybody money.

151
00:08:39.550 --> 00:08:41.770
Instead of looking for something, go get up and work.

152
00:08:42.130 --> 00:08:45.310
<v 0>This is his big thing. Oh, I'm about people working. No,</v>

153
00:08:45.311 --> 00:08:46.480
you're running a giveaway scam.

154
00:08:46.570 --> 00:08:48.460
Here's the incredible thing about this live by the way.

155
00:08:48.461 --> 00:08:52.810
And you can't make this stuff up after going on this rant about how he needs

156
00:08:52.811 --> 00:08:56.190
people to become self-sufficient what does he do? So, listen.

157
00:08:56.760 --> 00:08:59.010
<v 3>Starting now, since I'm fake,</v>

158
00:09:00.990 --> 00:09:05.250
starting now for the next hundred people to enroll in the Mathenia Academy,

159
00:09:05.520 --> 00:09:10.440
be giving away $30,000 to each person. Let's rewind that again,

160
00:09:10.441 --> 00:09:14.100
guys, for the next hundred people to enroll in the Messenia Academy,

161
00:09:14.460 --> 00:09:18.750
let's pull out the calculator, be giving away $30,000 to each person.

162
00:09:19.770 --> 00:09:20.603
How do you.

163
00:09:20.630 --> 00:09:24.190
<v 0>Right during a speech where he's saying you need to work the blah, blah, blah,</v>

164
00:09:24.191 --> 00:09:26.300
blah, and stop asking me for money.

165
00:09:26.390 --> 00:09:29.330
He promises you $3 million in a giveaway.

166
00:09:31.010 --> 00:09:35.480
So that's who Jay Masini is. In a nutshell, he's doing what is in my opinion,

167
00:09:35.481 --> 00:09:37.100
the largest giveaway scam.

168
00:09:37.580 --> 00:09:40.700
And we're going to tally up how much he's promised at the end of this video.

169
00:09:41.060 --> 00:09:45.140
But I want to show you how often he does this because unfortunately,

170
00:09:45.141 --> 00:09:48.800
even though repetition is repetitive, it also proves the point.

171
00:09:49.160 --> 00:09:51.560
So let's walk through some of his giveaways. Okay?

172
00:09:51.650 --> 00:09:52.700
And then at the end of this video,

173
00:09:52.701 --> 00:09:56.660
I'm going to show you how much total he's promised versus how much he could have

174
00:09:56.661 --> 00:09:57.020
made.

175
00:09:57.020 --> 00:10:01.250
If every single person bought the most expensive item on his entire website.

176
00:10:01.310 --> 00:10:02.143
Okay.

177
00:10:02.210 --> 00:10:04.040
<v 1>For the next thousand orders,</v>

178
00:10:04.520 --> 00:10:08.570
I'll be placing in $12,000 in each order, minimum order,

179
00:10:08.571 --> 00:10:09.920
six misogyny, Italy.

180
00:10:10.730 --> 00:10:14.600
<v 0>Okay. So you just promised to wait $12 million and the total sales,</v>

181
00:10:14.601 --> 00:10:15.650
he would have reaped from that.

182
00:10:15.651 --> 00:10:19.760
If everyone bought a minimum order of six and they paid the maximum amount per

183
00:10:19.761 --> 00:10:24.530
item, $85, he would have made sales of $510,000,

184
00:10:24.531 --> 00:10:26.450
but he promised 12 million. Okay.

185
00:10:27.380 --> 00:10:30.980
<v 1>This is another one for the next 300 magaziney Italy orders.</v>

186
00:10:31.520 --> 00:10:34.610
I'll be placing at $40,000 in each order.

187
00:10:35.270 --> 00:10:39.350
Minimum order is not [inaudible] Italy products. It can't only be mass.

188
00:10:39.680 --> 00:10:44.360
<v 0>Okay? Same deal. He's trying to give away $12 million here as well,</v>

189
00:10:44.570 --> 00:10:49.040
just in different amounts, 300 orders, but he's giving away $40,000. This time,

190
00:10:49.310 --> 00:10:53.900
minimum order of nine, meaning he can make $229,000. And again,

191
00:10:53.901 --> 00:10:55.090
that's sales, not profit.

192
00:10:55.290 --> 00:10:59.960
<v 3>And this only applies for the next 800 people to send the $750.</v>

193
00:11:00.530 --> 00:11:02.780
Listen, when you win, you lose, you lose at the end of the day,

194
00:11:03.200 --> 00:11:05.570
you're automatically getting an ebook. Yeah.

195
00:11:05.630 --> 00:11:09.140
<v 0>Again, the same thing where you're getting a product. Even if you lose no dude,</v>

196
00:11:09.141 --> 00:11:14.090
people aren't buying a minimum order of three magaziney eBooks in

197
00:11:14.091 --> 00:11:15.380
order to get themselves smarter.

198
00:11:15.590 --> 00:11:19.850
<v 3>You got to purchase a minimum order of three machining Academy ebook.</v>

199
00:11:20.030 --> 00:11:22.100
<v 0>Like why would someone buy three copies of a book?</v>

200
00:11:22.101 --> 00:11:26.180
That's your requirement of his sweepstakes? The there's so much fraud here.

201
00:11:26.210 --> 00:11:29.990
It's insane. And the fact that it's still going on is still mind blowing to me.

202
00:11:30.140 --> 00:11:33.680
This man has a million followers or close to a million followers on Instagram

203
00:11:33.890 --> 00:11:37.790
and he's running a scam of this caliber. And where's the FTC on this.

204
00:11:39.470 --> 00:11:43.220
<v 3>The next 5,000 people to subscribe to that magaziney Academy,</v>

205
00:11:43.670 --> 00:11:48.260
I'll be selecting 200 winners giving them $10,000 each.

206
00:11:48.410 --> 00:11:51.980
<v 0>Okay. Another $2 million giveaway, casual, Oh boy,</v>

207
00:11:52.010 --> 00:11:54.820
this is one of my favorites here guys. Here.

208
00:11:54.820 --> 00:11:59.020
<v 3>We go for each person to place in one, a thousand dollar misogyny,</v>

209
00:11:59.021 --> 00:12:02.440
Italy order. It's a law book.

210
00:12:03.580 --> 00:12:07.810
I'll be cutting out a check for $125,000.

211
00:12:08.320 --> 00:12:08.910
You spend it.

212
00:12:08.910 --> 00:12:12.660
<v 0>Thousand dollars on his website. I'll pay you $125,000 for shopping.</v>

213
00:12:12.690 --> 00:12:16.170
Thanks for shopping, dude. What is bill Gates done for the community?

214
00:12:17.220 --> 00:12:20.400
<v 3>Well, the next 800 people to placing the order and the machining Italy site,</v>

215
00:12:22.890 --> 00:12:24.510
there'll be $40,000

216
00:12:26.490 --> 00:12:28.920
in each order. Minimum.

217
00:12:29.550 --> 00:12:32.610
<v 0>Guys, that's $32 million.</v>

218
00:12:32.611 --> 00:12:36.930
He just promised a way on a live stream on Instagram either.

219
00:12:36.960 --> 00:12:39.330
This man is Gandhi either.

220
00:12:39.390 --> 00:12:44.010
He's a rich billionaire son who wants to burn through the money as fast as

221
00:12:44.011 --> 00:12:47.040
humanly possible or he's defrauding customers.

222
00:12:47.280 --> 00:12:48.630
You decide what you want to believe.

223
00:12:48.810 --> 00:12:51.330
So I think that's enough evidence to sort of prove my point,

224
00:12:51.570 --> 00:12:53.190
but I calculated out, you know,

225
00:12:53.191 --> 00:12:57.400
how much money total he's promised and it's a hundred million dollars.

226
00:12:57.810 --> 00:12:59.820
He's probably over a hundred million dollars.

227
00:13:00.180 --> 00:13:04.230
And the maximum he could have made from those a hundred million dollars is

228
00:13:04.231 --> 00:13:07.350
$7 million in sales. Coincidentally, uh,

229
00:13:07.380 --> 00:13:09.600
pretty close to what he says his company is.

230
00:13:09.690 --> 00:13:12.930
<v 3>Is worth $8 million net worth. I'm not saying, like I said before,</v>

231
00:13:13.170 --> 00:13:15.450
I don't have 8 million cash, but it's my net worth. I do.

232
00:13:16.830 --> 00:13:20.370
<v 0>What he's doing right now is a leap. I'm going, I'm going to tell you right now,</v>

233
00:13:20.371 --> 00:13:24.210
you can't promise to give away money in exchange for payment, right?

234
00:13:24.270 --> 00:13:27.930
You've changed for buying a product and then not give away the giveaway.

235
00:13:28.230 --> 00:13:31.020
And it leads me to something else I kind of want to talk about,

236
00:13:31.650 --> 00:13:36.330
which is this sort of a fake altruism that's been going around

237
00:13:36.331 --> 00:13:39.420
recently. And I just want to go out on a limb here. I mean,

238
00:13:39.450 --> 00:13:43.800
I know I'm going to sound like I'm entering conspiracy land,

239
00:13:43.801 --> 00:13:47.220
crazy world. Y'all are going to say Steven, you've gone off the deep end,

240
00:13:47.610 --> 00:13:52.290
but I want to humbly submit to you guys that these people may not be that

241
00:13:52.291 --> 00:13:54.570
good. I'm not saying they're necessarily bad,

242
00:13:54.600 --> 00:13:58.380
but you have to watch these people with the dose of skepticism.

243
00:13:58.381 --> 00:14:01.440
Maybe they're not just doing it out of the kindness of their heart.

244
00:14:01.650 --> 00:14:04.380
If every time they give away money, they have to film it.

245
00:14:04.440 --> 00:14:06.240
There's nothing wrong with, you know,

246
00:14:06.241 --> 00:14:09.630
saying that you're giving away money in order to raise awareness about an issue,

247
00:14:09.631 --> 00:14:12.750
right? Like you're raising money for cancer. But at the same time,

248
00:14:12.780 --> 00:14:16.140
if every time they do it, they have to get the camera crew. They have to say,

249
00:14:16.170 --> 00:14:19.800
Oh, they have to say how much money they're giving. This is $8,000. You know,

250
00:14:20.100 --> 00:14:22.410
I'm giving it to a poor person. Look how cool I am.

251
00:14:22.590 --> 00:14:27.060
I don't know if that's your whole brand I'm suspicious. So yeah, that covers it.

252
00:14:27.061 --> 00:14:29.220
I mean, I really wanted to go in depth with this one.

253
00:14:29.221 --> 00:14:33.870
I think we have that we've definitively showed the scam as it

254
00:14:33.871 --> 00:14:34.950
is. Uh,

255
00:14:34.951 --> 00:14:38.100
you guys can't be doing these Instagram giveaways thinking you're going to get

256
00:14:38.101 --> 00:14:40.020
away with it. People are going to catch on,

257
00:14:40.050 --> 00:14:41.970
they are going to start cataloging it.

258
00:14:42.390 --> 00:14:46.530
And eventually he will be caught ladies and gentlemen, thanks for coming by.

259
00:14:46.560 --> 00:14:49.410
Thanks for watching spreadsheet in the link below.

260
00:14:49.440 --> 00:14:52.580
If you want to go see the evidence for yourself and I'll see you in the next

261
00:14:52.581 --> 00:14:53.414
one.

262
00:15:05.930 --> 00:15:05.930
<v 4>[Inaudible].</v>
