00:00:00.270 --> 00:00:02.910
<v 0>Hello. I wanted to be the first to congratulate you.</v>

2
00:00:03.510 --> 00:00:06.810
Congratulations on making it through, uh, the year.

3
00:00:06.990 --> 00:00:09.650
Maybe you fist bump for more comfortable with that guys.

4
00:00:09.651 --> 00:00:12.500
We did it the worst year on record,

5
00:00:12.830 --> 00:00:16.640
a literal dumpster fire in some kind of a tsunami situation.

6
00:00:16.880 --> 00:00:20.600
It just kept coming. Even think about the fact that it was a leap here. I mean,

7
00:00:20.601 --> 00:00:24.320
what a slap in the face we had to take another day of this horrible year.

8
00:00:25.820 --> 00:00:30.440
It just would not stop in every possible sense. This year was too long, too bad,

9
00:00:30.441 --> 00:00:35.240
too sad. And I want to forget about it forever. I say, collectively, look,

10
00:00:35.390 --> 00:00:38.990
let's erase it from the subconscious. Let's tear it out of the calendars.

11
00:00:39.290 --> 00:00:42.980
Even vision shouldn't be described as 2020. It's just, you have good vision.

12
00:00:42.981 --> 00:00:43.850
Now, now guys,

13
00:00:43.940 --> 00:00:47.900
the other thing I want to say is that when exiting a bad year like this,

14
00:00:48.230 --> 00:00:52.430
you have to be extra positive. Look, we need to start off on the right foot.

15
00:00:52.460 --> 00:00:55.340
It's important to start 20, 21 off, right?

16
00:00:55.580 --> 00:01:00.200
Because otherwise it could be just as bad is this year. And that for me,

17
00:01:00.230 --> 00:01:02.690
for many of you, I know it's not an option.

18
00:01:02.960 --> 00:01:05.390
So Mark my words and embarrass me later,

19
00:01:05.570 --> 00:01:09.410
2021 is here. And I look, I want to,

20
00:01:09.411 --> 00:01:13.100
I want to start off with a bang look, big announcement right off the bat,

21
00:01:13.430 --> 00:01:17.540
go in daily boys, seven days a week, or at least that's what we're trying.

22
00:01:17.930 --> 00:01:20.450
And to start, start it off. Look, I've just heard.

23
00:01:20.480 --> 00:01:24.080
If you want to increase your odds of new year's resolutions like this,

24
00:01:24.081 --> 00:01:28.220
actually sticking there's something called loss aversion that helps improves

25
00:01:28.221 --> 00:01:32.750
your odds of success. What does loss, aversion, torture?

26
00:01:33.050 --> 00:01:37.250
Self-inflicted torture if you fail your goal. So this can mean anything.

27
00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:41.060
You know, you have to donate to a charity. You hate, you have to, you know,

28
00:01:41.300 --> 00:01:43.910
get tased, shoot yourself with a paintball gun.

29
00:01:43.911 --> 00:01:48.860
But although all that pain that's temporary. I had to think I had to dig deep.

30
00:01:49.070 --> 00:01:52.280
What kind of person would be forever? What would I really fear?

31
00:01:53.120 --> 00:01:55.370
And I came up with it, ladies and gentlemen,

32
00:01:55.490 --> 00:01:59.420
if I miss an upload in January of 2021,

33
00:01:59.750 --> 00:02:02.120
I will be going bald. Yes, that's right.

34
00:02:02.121 --> 00:02:06.830
I will be shaving all this off gone by the way.

35
00:02:07.130 --> 00:02:11.690
Some people they have like good head shapes. Yes, yes,

36
00:02:12.110 --> 00:02:16.760
yes. Me not so much. Watch it sits unfortunate.

37
00:02:16.761 --> 00:02:20.930
My head is a weirdly large uncomfortably, large, actually,

38
00:02:20.931 --> 00:02:23.990
when you see it on my frame, I mean, if you see it in person,

39
00:02:24.050 --> 00:02:27.140
but especially if this mask is taken off,

40
00:02:27.470 --> 00:02:31.550
I think the contrast would be too much. I actually ran a little AI filter.

41
00:02:31.790 --> 00:02:32.810
See what it would look like.

42
00:02:32.810 --> 00:02:37.460
So you guys could see my torture ahead of time and I'm sure many memes will be

43
00:02:37.461 --> 00:02:39.680
made of it if I actually have to go through with this.

44
00:02:39.980 --> 00:02:44.810
So I'm going to try hard not to, uh, this is, this is what it looks like.

45
00:02:44.840 --> 00:02:49.670
Enjoy not, not going to happen though. Not going to happen. It's not an option.

46
00:02:49.790 --> 00:02:52.070
So that's what I'm doing. Let me know in the comments below what you're doing.

47
00:02:52.071 --> 00:02:56.450
Look start 20, 21 off aggressively. Go, go in, make a big goal.

48
00:02:56.690 --> 00:02:59.800
Tell me if you're going to do some loss of version two. I think be interesting.

49
00:02:59.980 --> 00:03:03.880
If as a community, we were all hurting ourselves.

50
00:03:03.881 --> 00:03:08.650
If we didn't even go through with our, uh, you know, gym membership plans, book,

51
00:03:08.651 --> 00:03:11.200
reading goals, whatever you have going on in your life,

52
00:03:11.500 --> 00:03:13.450
but I wish you the best look.

53
00:03:13.810 --> 00:03:17.710
I know I'm a little bit cynical sometimes with these gurus looking at these

54
00:03:17.711 --> 00:03:18.310
scams,

55
00:03:18.310 --> 00:03:23.170
but the truth is I'm an optimist at heart and I wish you the very best of

56
00:03:23.171 --> 00:03:26.020
years, 20. I'm not even gonna say, look,

57
00:03:26.260 --> 00:03:29.770
last year has gone long live 2021.

58
00:03:30.880 --> 00:03:31.360
See you in the next one.
