00:00:00.090 --> 00:00:03.060
<v 0>Boys. Welcome back to the channel. As you guys know,</v>

2
00:00:03.270 --> 00:00:06.660
been investing millions of dollars into the studio, but I got a camera.

3
00:00:06.690 --> 00:00:10.230
I don't know how to really operate. And I pressed the wrong button.

4
00:00:10.231 --> 00:00:13.920
I just want to show you guys this. I screwed up the white balance. Okay.

5
00:00:13.950 --> 00:00:17.970
Look at me there. Look out tan. I was,

6
00:00:18.570 --> 00:00:22.830
and then now, somehow I mess. I'm going to figure it out my half Cuban side.

7
00:00:22.860 --> 00:00:26.880
When I turn this setting on left the building. Okay. And the white,

8
00:00:27.450 --> 00:00:30.780
the whiteness that I have in my running through my veins, hostile takeover.

9
00:00:30.781 --> 00:00:34.500
But anyway, I'll be trying to get that somewhere in that look back and look,

10
00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:38.400
it's not that I'm vain. I just don't want to be accused of identity theft. Look,

11
00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:42.330
there's already one too many of these, a pale half Cuban boys with beards,

12
00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:44.190
his name, Steven on the internet. You know what I mean?

13
00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:50.160
Like that's not that's, that's not us. Our name is not Steven Bucknell.

14
00:00:50.161 --> 00:00:55.050
So anyway, that's my point. So this is my official announcement. It's my camera.

15
00:00:55.080 --> 00:00:58.590
It's the million dollar setup it's screwed up right now. I'm going to fix it.

16
00:00:58.620 --> 00:00:59.700
But in the meantime,

17
00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:04.860
I had a professor who just was arrested for secretly

18
00:01:04.861 --> 00:01:09.510
working for China. And that's, I mean, that's it. That's,

19
00:01:09.520 --> 00:01:12.750
that's the headline and it's absolutely true. Check this out.

20
00:01:12.751 --> 00:01:16.560
This is so blow your mind. So somebody sent me this as you guys know,

21
00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:19.760
I went to Texas a and M hold your applause, please.

22
00:01:21.650 --> 00:01:26.500
<v 1>Stop it. Stop it. Stop it. Stop it. Stop it.</v>

23
00:01:26.501 --> 00:01:29.990
Stop it. Stop it. Okay. Keep going, keep going.

24
00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:38.630
<v 0>I know it's kind of a big deal. Okay. I went to Texas a and M anyways,</v>

25
00:01:38.870 --> 00:01:43.520
I saw this little article in the battalion and it said

26
00:01:43.521 --> 00:01:45.350
Texas a and M professor arrested,

27
00:01:45.380 --> 00:01:49.070
accused of lying about Chinese affiliations while working with NASA.

28
00:01:49.610 --> 00:01:51.080
And so I see this guy, I'm like, Oh,

29
00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:52.550
it's just probably some guy that I don't know.

30
00:01:52.551 --> 00:01:56.330
And then I'm like zooming in and I'm like, wait, that guy looks familiar.

31
00:01:57.110 --> 00:01:59.180
And then I thought to me, I mean, it's been a while since I've been in college,

32
00:01:59.181 --> 00:02:02.210
it's been a few years now, but I was like, did I take that professor?

33
00:02:02.480 --> 00:02:05.210
I felt like I had that professor before I could swear I had them.

34
00:02:06.080 --> 00:02:10.790
So I looked them up Zang dunk Chang, or, uh, Dr. Chang,

35
00:02:11.480 --> 00:02:15.200
as we knew him and sure enough, like I'm bad with names,

36
00:02:15.201 --> 00:02:18.620
but I remember this guy. I was like something about this guy.

37
00:02:18.920 --> 00:02:23.000
I know I had it before. Check this out, dude, ladies and gentlemen,

38
00:02:23.030 --> 00:02:26.960
I log back into my old account and look back in

39
00:02:26.961 --> 00:02:31.550
2015. And yes, I took him. I had his safety course,

40
00:02:32.210 --> 00:02:37.100
uh, safety engineering course. And I had Zang Chang in Monday,

41
00:02:37.101 --> 00:02:41.810
Wednesday, Friday in the blocker room, which was a building on campus.

42
00:02:42.470 --> 00:02:43.670
Now, what does that mean, guys?

43
00:02:43.671 --> 00:02:48.500
Am I qualified to speak about whether Zang shanks worked for

44
00:02:48.501 --> 00:02:52.160
China or not? I think so. In fact,

45
00:02:52.190 --> 00:02:56.990
I think I have incriminating circumstantial evidence to add if the DOJ wants

46
00:02:56.991 --> 00:02:59.980
to call me, you know, I'm ready to CAUTI nine, this guy,

47
00:03:00.010 --> 00:03:04.480
because when you go look at the court order, he had been committing this, uh,

48
00:03:04.600 --> 00:03:07.960
these actions from April, 2013 until present,

49
00:03:07.961 --> 00:03:11.170
which means at the time I was taking his course,

50
00:03:11.320 --> 00:03:13.570
he was fraudulent currently, uh,

51
00:03:14.350 --> 00:03:18.960
working for China while also working for America and maybe

52
00:03:18.990 --> 00:03:23.220
allegedly, maybe stealing trade secrets from American companies.

53
00:03:24.150 --> 00:03:28.710
Now I want to talk about my experience with them because I kind of feel bad

54
00:03:29.580 --> 00:03:33.450
because frankly, this guy was a great professor.

55
00:03:33.480 --> 00:03:38.190
Well by great professor. I mean that, I got an a, in his course, dude,

56
00:03:38.520 --> 00:03:40.860
I was not the perfect student, as you can tell,

57
00:03:41.370 --> 00:03:44.430
but I got an a in that guy's course. And the one thing I remember about it

58
00:03:46.920 --> 00:03:50.280
is that I never went to that class at the beginning of every year in college,

59
00:03:50.281 --> 00:03:52.650
you try to determine which of these classes do I actually actually,

60
00:03:52.710 --> 00:03:56.790
you have to attend and which ones can I just study right before the test?

61
00:03:57.120 --> 00:04:00.630
This was definitely a study right before the test. And I thought at the time,

62
00:04:00.840 --> 00:04:02.970
huh? That's weird. A lot of these professors were like,

63
00:04:02.971 --> 00:04:07.200
you had to show up consistently, but now it makes sense.

64
00:04:07.440 --> 00:04:11.610
Cause I think this guy was too busy working for China to really,

65
00:04:12.200 --> 00:04:15.240
really run the class. And it's not just me saying that, like,

66
00:04:15.241 --> 00:04:16.800
just look at the criminal complaint.

67
00:04:16.950 --> 00:04:20.610
It says that during and about nine months he spent approximately

68
00:04:20.611 --> 00:04:25.050
133 days outside of the United States.

69
00:04:25.440 --> 00:04:28.830
So he is going back and forth between tryina and the us all the time.

70
00:04:28.831 --> 00:04:31.110
So how are his students going to show up?

71
00:04:31.140 --> 00:04:33.090
He doesn't even want him to show up because he's not going to be there,

72
00:04:33.270 --> 00:04:35.970
but it's hard for me to hate on him too much because at the time,

73
00:04:35.971 --> 00:04:39.690
and still now I was like, when you're trying to keep your GPA up, I mean,

74
00:04:39.691 --> 00:04:42.270
it's pretty nice to get an a, for barely showing up at all.

75
00:04:42.480 --> 00:04:46.260
So I don't know. I'm conflicted about this one.

76
00:04:46.261 --> 00:04:51.030
I really am because I liked saying dunk Chang. I really did.

77
00:04:51.600 --> 00:04:56.520
And now it turns out he may have been a Chinese spy. And I, uh,

78
00:04:56.550 --> 00:04:59.340
I don't know really how to feel about it because on the one hand I want him to

79
00:04:59.341 --> 00:05:03.540
get acquitted on the other end.

80
00:05:04.500 --> 00:05:07.800
He definitely lied. He was very sneaky.

81
00:05:07.950 --> 00:05:12.690
Apparently my professor was trying to become something called a TTP

82
00:05:13.020 --> 00:05:15.840
recipient. It's called the Chinese talent program.

83
00:05:15.841 --> 00:05:20.580
But allegedly it's just the way that they pay scientists who work in

84
00:05:20.581 --> 00:05:24.960
America. Um, and they get them to steal IP.

85
00:05:25.500 --> 00:05:27.480
I mean, that's definitely simplifying it, but

86
00:05:29.010 --> 00:05:30.810
that's basically what this thing alleges.

87
00:05:31.470 --> 00:05:35.160
It's kind of a big deal that this guy was working for NASA.

88
00:05:35.370 --> 00:05:38.340
He got this almost million dollar grant with NASA,

89
00:05:38.341 --> 00:05:40.290
which he was the principal investigator on.

90
00:05:40.530 --> 00:05:43.920
And he was constantly certifying throughout that process that he has no

91
00:05:43.980 --> 00:05:47.670
affiliations with China because he's going to get these us grant to work on U S

92
00:05:47.671 --> 00:05:48.504
technology.

93
00:05:48.720 --> 00:05:53.190
And he conveniently forgets to mention that he had a Chinese

94
00:05:53.191 --> 00:05:57.410
technology company that a key fob, Oh, Andy conveniently forgets to that.

95
00:05:57.411 --> 00:06:01.670
He filed two Chinese patents while he's working for NASA based on similar

96
00:06:01.671 --> 00:06:04.970
research. I mean, you can't make this stuff up, dude. He's, double-dipping hard,

97
00:06:05.030 --> 00:06:09.560
not a good luck for Texas a and M and definitely not a good look for my

98
00:06:09.561 --> 00:06:12.920
professor here. I don't know. I mean, on the one hand,

99
00:06:12.980 --> 00:06:17.180
how do you guys feel having a professor that gives you A's for basically doing

100
00:06:17.181 --> 00:06:18.770
nothing? On the other hand,

101
00:06:18.771 --> 00:06:23.630
your professor is working for the Chinese government while getting NASA

102
00:06:23.631 --> 00:06:26.420
grants and potentially handing over IP.

103
00:06:26.630 --> 00:06:31.610
And it's not just Zang dog Chang who's, uh, you know, who's tied to China.

104
00:06:31.611 --> 00:06:34.340
It's a bunch of these guys look at this.

105
00:06:34.430 --> 00:06:38.060
This is a former Cleveland clinic researcher charged with fraud for failing to

106
00:06:38.061 --> 00:06:40.190
disclose China ties. It's the same thing.

107
00:06:40.760 --> 00:06:43.700
Look at this guy claimed Harvard scientists is arrested,

108
00:06:43.701 --> 00:06:48.650
accused of lying about ties to China. It's an epidemic. I found this, uh,

109
00:06:48.680 --> 00:06:52.850
paper in science mag four years after the national institutes of health began to

110
00:06:52.851 --> 00:06:55.760
investigate grantees who had believed it failed to disclose their ties to

111
00:06:55.761 --> 00:06:58.910
foreign governments. Officials still don't know the extent of the problem.

112
00:06:59.120 --> 00:07:02.960
We learned of 150 cases in the last 12 months.

113
00:07:03.380 --> 00:07:06.560
So this is a extremely bad,

114
00:07:07.520 --> 00:07:11.360
and this was a very sneaky thing for St. John Jane to do.

115
00:07:11.420 --> 00:07:14.450
And I'm disappointed in him as a former student of his,

116
00:07:14.480 --> 00:07:17.870
but what I'm most interested in is to see what China's response to this is

117
00:07:17.871 --> 00:07:22.460
whether they're going to try to get them back to the country or what I mean,

118
00:07:22.940 --> 00:07:24.770
I don't know. We'll see. Anyway, that's it.

119
00:07:24.800 --> 00:07:28.310
Let me know what you think in the comments below. Thanks for watching.
