1
00:00:03.720 --> 00:00:08.250
<v 0>Today. I am announcing my plans to become your next mayor of London.</v>

2
00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:11.333
Whew.

3
00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:16.460
[inaudible].

4
00:00:16.460 --> 00:00:21.260
<v 1>Christmas came early, boys. I have been calling this for over a month. Now.</v>

5
00:00:21.290 --> 00:00:25.460
I'll show you proof right now. So you know that I'm not lying. Look at this.

6
00:00:25.461 --> 00:00:28.100
This is me. The 17th of September,

7
00:00:28.101 --> 00:00:32.660
Brian Rose is going into politics in the next 12 months. I'm calling it now.

8
00:00:32.690 --> 00:00:34.160
I knew it. Why?

9
00:00:34.910 --> 00:00:38.120
Because everyone was seeing through his lies,

10
00:00:38.121 --> 00:00:42.080
his deception and people were starting to see who Brian Rose actually is.

11
00:00:42.081 --> 00:00:47.030
He's a grifter, AKA. He goes back and forth between different causes.

12
00:00:47.031 --> 00:00:50.570
Never really sticking with one. Just trying to get your money. Oh yeah.

13
00:00:50.571 --> 00:00:51.500
And he's really good at it.

14
00:00:51.590 --> 00:00:53.960
He got a million dollars for the digital freedom platform.

15
00:00:53.961 --> 00:00:57.560
What has he done with that? Nothing. He said he was going to build a platform.

16
00:00:57.620 --> 00:01:01.760
Instead he hired out third-party software. He said he was going to Sue YouTube.

17
00:01:02.120 --> 00:01:05.060
He hasn't sued YouTube. He said he was going to get blockchain technology.

18
00:01:05.120 --> 00:01:09.650
He hasn't gotten blockchain technology. Instead. He spent your money for what?

19
00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:13.160
Where's those additive accounts. Oh, well, sorry. He's moving on.

20
00:01:13.161 --> 00:01:16.550
He doesn't care about your money anymore that he took from you instead.

21
00:01:16.580 --> 00:01:19.070
Now he's going on to his next grift. Actually,

22
00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:22.220
he had a grift before running for mayor, but this is his newest grip,

23
00:01:22.250 --> 00:01:23.570
which we'll get into in a second. Uh,

24
00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:27.230
but I knew that he was going to do this right, because Grifters got a grift.

25
00:01:27.260 --> 00:01:29.510
And when they fail to come through on their promises,

26
00:01:29.511 --> 00:01:31.880
they have to move on to the next thing quickly. Right?

27
00:01:32.120 --> 00:01:34.610
So he was supposed to be the freedom of speech guy.

28
00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:38.510
Now he's moved on from that he's lost patients cause his followers no longer

29
00:01:38.511 --> 00:01:41.120
support him. So then he moved on to this new thing.

30
00:01:41.210 --> 00:01:46.100
It was a reality show that he launched in June 23 of 2020. Yeah.

31
00:01:46.230 --> 00:01:49.640
<v 0>And we want to help you create that.</v>

32
00:01:49.960 --> 00:01:52.880
<v 1>And it's formation that didn't work. So he's got to move on to the next script.</v>

33
00:01:52.881 --> 00:01:54.320
He can't get money from you that way.

34
00:01:54.470 --> 00:01:57.170
He's not getting any of your donations anymore. He's got to move on.

35
00:01:57.320 --> 00:02:00.320
So now he's running for politics. All of a sudden, out of nowhere,

36
00:02:00.321 --> 00:02:04.880
I see videos like this, how we get London back to work. And I say to myself, Oh,

37
00:02:04.881 --> 00:02:09.050
this fits with nothing Brian has done before. It must be a campaign.

38
00:02:09.051 --> 00:02:12.800
He must be running for office. And sure enough, I was right now.

39
00:02:12.890 --> 00:02:16.160
Let me say right up front. Whether or not you agree with me,

40
00:02:16.161 --> 00:02:19.490
whether or not you want Brian Rose to win. Let me tell you,

41
00:02:20.090 --> 00:02:23.390
you tubers have a bad track record with running for office.

42
00:02:23.420 --> 00:02:26.720
I'm just going to be honest. If we're talking about his legitimate odds,

43
00:02:26.750 --> 00:02:31.040
regardless of my opinion, regardless of your opinion, you know, we have a low,

44
00:02:31.070 --> 00:02:34.640
we don't have a huge sample set of YouTube. We really only have a few examples.

45
00:02:34.670 --> 00:02:38.930
We have people like Carl Benjamin who ran for office in the UK, uh, failed.

46
00:02:38.960 --> 00:02:42.680
We have people like Joey salads who ran for office in America failed.

47
00:02:42.830 --> 00:02:46.460
Now you can argue case by case what mistakes they made and running.

48
00:02:46.760 --> 00:02:50.630
But by and large, it seems to me that, uh, just YouTubers deciding that,

49
00:02:50.690 --> 00:02:52.160
Oh yeah, I could just run for office.

50
00:02:52.490 --> 00:02:55.790
I don't think they fully understand that this is not a game you can just jump

51
00:02:55.791 --> 00:02:56.840
into overnight.

52
00:02:57.020 --> 00:03:00.970
So my prediction is this is going to be a total disaster.

53
00:03:01.060 --> 00:03:03.490
I think the media is going to eat him alive.

54
00:03:03.850 --> 00:03:06.790
His supporters are going to eat him alive after they realized he doesn't

55
00:03:06.791 --> 00:03:10.720
actually care about free speech. And he doesn't actually care about, uh,

56
00:03:11.020 --> 00:03:12.040
censored voices.

57
00:03:12.041 --> 00:03:14.740
He's going to drop them like a hot potato as soon as it's politically

58
00:03:14.741 --> 00:03:17.560
convenient. And I think his history of grifting is going to eat him alive,

59
00:03:17.800 --> 00:03:22.660
his history of failing to come through on his promises and his repeated lies.

60
00:03:22.720 --> 00:03:26.230
I think it's going to catch up with him because he's already asking for more

61
00:03:26.231 --> 00:03:30.250
donations. I mean, Brian, I bet you didn't donate. Rose is back baby.

62
00:03:30.720 --> 00:03:33.270
<v 0>It's your email address? And he wants your money. Third,</v>

63
00:03:33.780 --> 00:03:38.040
give us your email address below as well as a link on how to volunteer and

64
00:03:38.041 --> 00:03:39.180
donate to my campaign.

65
00:03:39.630 --> 00:03:43.140
<v 1>There it is. All right, look at that. Look,</v>

66
00:03:43.141 --> 00:03:44.970
there's a little donate button and everything.

67
00:03:44.971 --> 00:03:47.970
I wonder how he figured out how to fundraise like that. I mean, honestly, dude,

68
00:03:47.971 --> 00:03:49.830
I think he's going to head fake his supporters again. He's going to be like,

69
00:03:49.831 --> 00:03:53.820
yeah. Donate to my campaign. I'm Mr. Politician now. And then in three weeks,

70
00:03:53.910 --> 00:03:55.350
he's going to drop out, take the money and run.

71
00:03:55.530 --> 00:03:59.670
<v 0>I will need the help of every citizen of this great city working together</v>

72
00:03:59.790 --> 00:04:00.870
towards our common goal.

73
00:04:01.980 --> 00:04:05.490
<v 1>To be completely honest with you guys. I think Brian's biggest advantage.</v>

74
00:04:05.520 --> 00:04:10.080
If I'm going to pay him a compliment is that politicians are sleazy.

75
00:04:10.110 --> 00:04:13.740
They're deceptive. They lie, they cheat, they steal,

76
00:04:14.070 --> 00:04:17.850
Hey then I just give the Tinder profile of Brian Rose.

77
00:04:17.910 --> 00:04:22.800
So I actually think in some ways maybe Brian Rose is the most fit utuber to ever

78
00:04:22.801 --> 00:04:27.390
go into office. And for that reason he could be a good fit, like in terms of,

79
00:04:27.391 --> 00:04:30.630
I think he can lie enough. I think he's definitely enough of a snake.

80
00:04:30.690 --> 00:04:33.030
So I think he's going to do just fine in that sense.

81
00:04:33.031 --> 00:04:35.460
But I also think his ties with David, Ike,

82
00:04:35.461 --> 00:04:37.800
people like that are going to hurt him.

83
00:04:38.070 --> 00:04:41.160
And I think he's going to try to distance himself from those people,

84
00:04:41.460 --> 00:04:43.590
but that it's not going to work.

85
00:04:43.620 --> 00:04:47.130
And his followers are going to hate that because they like Brian Rose.

86
00:04:47.280 --> 00:04:49.560
Cause they think, Oh man, he, he actually is one of us.

87
00:04:49.590 --> 00:04:53.130
When in reality he just used David Ike for his own means.

88
00:04:53.131 --> 00:04:55.320
He's going to throw them away as soon as he can. I mean,

89
00:04:55.321 --> 00:04:59.340
but one thing I want to call out from the very get go is that he lies about like

90
00:04:59.341 --> 00:05:02.370
why he's running for office. He says he wasn't planning to run for mayor,

91
00:05:02.580 --> 00:05:04.350
but that he couldn't stand idly by.

92
00:05:04.590 --> 00:05:07.020
<v 0>I had no intention of becoming your next mayor.</v>

93
00:05:07.740 --> 00:05:11.610
I have always been an entrepreneur and a broadcaster first.

94
00:05:12.780 --> 00:05:13.890
<v 1>I've always been a grifter.</v>

95
00:05:13.891 --> 00:05:17.730
But then I realized politics is one of the greatest grifting games of mankind.

96
00:05:17.760 --> 00:05:21.050
And that's why he chose to run for mayor because he's just scrambling his

97
00:05:21.630 --> 00:05:21.991
businesses failing.

98
00:05:21.991 --> 00:05:26.070
He needs something to do other than his business because no one believes in him

99
00:05:26.071 --> 00:05:30.510
anymore. I mean, if you look at his most recent crowdfunding campaign for, uh,

100
00:05:30.511 --> 00:05:32.640
you know, his followers, his grifting campaign,

101
00:05:32.760 --> 00:05:37.620
he's only raised $2,500 of the $250,000 he

102
00:05:37.621 --> 00:05:40.830
needs in this month. And it's already halfway through the month.

103
00:05:40.890 --> 00:05:43.320
So people aren't supporting him anymore. He knows it.

104
00:05:43.321 --> 00:05:46.350
He needs something to shift to, which is why he's running for office.

105
00:05:46.620 --> 00:05:49.920
That's my prediction. We will be covering this. I'm fascinated, dude.

106
00:05:50.130 --> 00:05:54.270
If anything else is going to be super entertaining and I'm here for it, dude.

107
00:05:54.600 --> 00:05:58.010
Anyway, that's it. I got, I'll see you.

108
00:05:58.010 --> 00:05:58.843
<v 2>Guys next time,</v>

109
00:06:01.040 --> 00:06:03.770
but you didn't donate all the people that donated to the original freedom

110
00:06:03.771 --> 00:06:05.720
platform you didn't donate.

111
00:06:08.190 --> 00:06:12.460
You do shut us down near the freedom bowl. So again,

112
00:06:12.530 --> 00:06:13.760
we're closing this thing out on May 3rd.

113
00:06:13.761 --> 00:06:18.350
So one need your money donate to my campaign. Amino. Love your mom, man.

114
00:06:24.820 --> 00:06:26.840
[inaudible] everything that you've donated. It's being put to use.

115
00:06:31.530 --> 00:06:32.363
[inaudible].

116
00:06:32.690 --> 00:06:33.950
<v 3>Appreciate it. I'm putting it to a series of use.</v>

117
00:06:33.950 --> 00:06:35.660
<v 2>Here. You might say I'm crazy,</v>

118
00:06:37.270 --> 00:06:41.690
but I say donate to my campaign. I, they didn't donate,

119
00:06:43.430 --> 00:06:45.860
but they didn't donate today.

120
00:06:46.220 --> 00:06:48.920
I'm announcing my plans to become your next mayor.

121
00:06:49.760 --> 00:06:51.680
Let me guess you didn't donate.
