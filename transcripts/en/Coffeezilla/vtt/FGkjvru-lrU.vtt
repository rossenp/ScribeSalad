00:00:00.180 --> 00:00:01.230
<v 0>Ladies and gentlemen,</v>

2
00:00:01.260 --> 00:00:06.240
today is an interesting object lesson in how easy it is to fake social proof,

3
00:00:07.020 --> 00:00:09.090
scam people and projected image of success.

4
00:00:09.390 --> 00:00:13.290
All the while the reality is completely different. You're almost like fan hosts.

5
00:00:13.291 --> 00:00:16.860
You just reality is whatever you want it to be right today.

6
00:00:16.861 --> 00:00:20.010
We're looking at eight. Wanna be Bernie Maydoff, uh,

7
00:00:20.011 --> 00:00:24.480
Mr. Dr. Terrence cash. Now, first of all, what a name?

8
00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:29.190
How did these people come up with it? Derek money, Berg, Wesley billion,

9
00:00:29.191 --> 00:00:33.990
dollar Virgin Dan, the trillion dollar man Pena and Dr. Terrance cash.

10
00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:37.620
They all go in the Pantheon of great business. Coach wealth, coach,

11
00:00:37.621 --> 00:00:41.820
financial coach names. They're all going to help you and look let's,

12
00:00:41.821 --> 00:00:45.270
let's see what he's doing before we get into how it all fell apart. You know,

13
00:00:45.271 --> 00:00:48.270
all the crazy stuff now going on in the press,

14
00:00:48.540 --> 00:00:51.900
let's get into who this guy was like. Let's say you didn't, you know,

15
00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:55.080
you're looking at him a few months ago. What do you see? The four coffees.

16
00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:56.520
Ella makes a video about a before.

17
00:00:56.521 --> 00:00:59.670
All this stuff happens right before it all comes crumbling down.

18
00:00:59.730 --> 00:01:03.930
This is basically what you get on his page. It just projects success, right?

19
00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:08.310
He's uh, he's on a magazine. It looks like right over here. And um,

20
00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:13.200
you know, it's like transforming your wealth and he's a wealth coach,

21
00:01:13.230 --> 00:01:16.560
but his name is Dr. All that kind of sounds credible. Right?

22
00:01:16.980 --> 00:01:20.550
He's got a little video for us. Let's see that everyday people struggle,

23
00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:24.150
but they have no plan. They don't know the money rules used by the wealthy,

24
00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:29.250
but lucky for you, Dr. Terrence cash is willing to help you out.

25
00:01:29.251 --> 00:01:30.360
Out of the kindness of his heart.

26
00:01:30.740 --> 00:01:33.260
<v 1>I am not hiking through the Himalayas, went out and guy,</v>

27
00:01:33.770 --> 00:01:37.790
I'm simply not doing it. If you want to do it, send me the pictures.

28
00:01:38.270 --> 00:01:41.750
<v 0>I guess he's saying you need a coach or something like that. Okay? Whatever.</v>

29
00:01:42.230 --> 00:01:45.230
He's got a wealth creation course, you know, this kind of thing.

30
00:01:45.530 --> 00:01:48.410
And most importantly, something I want to draw your attention to.

31
00:01:48.590 --> 00:01:53.450
He's got the strategic diversified investment chairman's fund. Okay.

32
00:01:53.720 --> 00:01:56.120
Bite you with passive income later on,

33
00:01:56.360 --> 00:02:00.410
he would say that this is 12% a year guaranteed.

34
00:02:00.530 --> 00:02:01.670
It's why he's a wannabe made.

35
00:02:01.970 --> 00:02:06.680
Cause that's what ma Bernie Madoff was famous for offering somewhat reasonable

36
00:02:06.681 --> 00:02:10.010
returns that were just high, like 10% a year. It's not too much,

37
00:02:10.220 --> 00:02:11.510
but it was consistent. Right?

38
00:02:11.511 --> 00:02:15.470
And so that's what made off did it's exactly what this guy did too.

39
00:02:15.890 --> 00:02:19.340
But the big takeaway here is that Dr. Cash, okay.

40
00:02:19.490 --> 00:02:23.570
Had every trapping of success. He was going to events.

41
00:02:23.630 --> 00:02:27.680
He even raised $4 million for his chairman's fund, right?

42
00:02:27.950 --> 00:02:31.190
Where he supposedly taking on investors and paying them out 12%,

43
00:02:31.460 --> 00:02:33.620
everything seems to be going great. In fact,

44
00:02:33.621 --> 00:02:36.470
he's got a whole sob story about how it used to be broke, but now he's rich.

45
00:02:36.500 --> 00:02:37.520
Thanks to, uh, the,

46
00:02:37.690 --> 00:02:40.670
the rich people who shared their secrets with him that he's willing to share

47
00:02:40.671 --> 00:02:41.504
with you. Now.

48
00:02:42.290 --> 00:02:46.430
<v 1>16 Years later that once failing business was now producing over</v>

49
00:02:47.660 --> 00:02:49.070
$30 million in annual revenues.

50
00:02:49.400 --> 00:02:53.630
<v 0>You heard it right guys, Dr. Taryn's cash has a $30 million a year business.</v>

51
00:02:54.530 --> 00:02:58.100
<v 1>Ultimately after considering a nine figure IPO,</v>

52
00:02:58.580 --> 00:03:01.540
he enjoyed private sale of the business for eight figures.

53
00:03:02.280 --> 00:03:05.370
<v 0>He's super wealthy, all this stuff. You get the idea. So</v>

54
00:03:07.260 --> 00:03:09.120
why do I hear sirens?

55
00:03:09.180 --> 00:03:13.860
It's pretty simple because everything you just heard is all

56
00:03:14.190 --> 00:03:17.850
a fabrication. See all his, you know, chairman's fund all that stuff.

57
00:03:18.090 --> 00:03:21.900
It's all a gigantic fraud. In fact, Dr.

58
00:03:21.990 --> 00:03:26.850
Cash was just arrested for securities fraud from all his investors. So let's,

59
00:03:27.030 --> 00:03:31.140
let's take a peek inside of this complaint letter from the sec and

60
00:03:31.141 --> 00:03:33.450
DOJ, it gets spicy.

61
00:03:33.900 --> 00:03:38.670
Now the first thing to note is that Dr. Cash shockingly is not his real

62
00:03:38.671 --> 00:03:42.180
name. His real name is Terrence chalk,

63
00:03:42.420 --> 00:03:46.350
which I'll admit is a little less inspired than Dr. Terrence cash.

64
00:03:46.530 --> 00:03:49.770
But the reason that he changed his name is very interesting.

65
00:03:49.800 --> 00:03:54.090
You'll be interested to know, see Terrence chop. He's a convicted felon.

66
00:03:54.570 --> 00:03:57.780
You'd never know that by searching Dr. Terrence cash. It doesn't,

67
00:03:58.020 --> 00:03:58.853
it doesn't come up.

68
00:03:59.280 --> 00:04:02.430
That's why he changed his name is so that he wouldn't come up.

69
00:04:02.431 --> 00:04:05.580
That he's a convicted felon. Why is he a convicted felon? Well,

70
00:04:05.640 --> 00:04:07.170
back in the two thousands,

71
00:04:07.620 --> 00:04:11.520
Terrence was arrested for identity theft and conspiring to make false statements

72
00:04:11.670 --> 00:04:13.500
to financial institutions.

73
00:04:14.010 --> 00:04:18.150
Apparently he applied for loans using the identifiers of a dead relative.

74
00:04:20.820 --> 00:04:21.060
<v 1>This.</v>

75
00:04:21.060 --> 00:04:23.220
<v 0>Is Dr. Terrence cash for you. Okay.</v>

76
00:04:23.640 --> 00:04:28.200
He also apparently submitted fraudulent documents to a BMW car dealership in

77
00:04:28.201 --> 00:04:31.500
order to secure a BMW vehicles for associates of his,

78
00:04:31.501 --> 00:04:36.240
he was imprisoned for 76 months before getting out and then claiming that he

79
00:04:36.241 --> 00:04:40.770
some successful entrepreneurs, see he calls himself the nation's number one,

80
00:04:40.771 --> 00:04:43.020
business money and wealth coach,

81
00:04:43.110 --> 00:04:47.550
which is kind of Alaris because he just got out of prison for financial fraud.

82
00:04:48.030 --> 00:04:49.590
And he's trying to teach you about money.

83
00:04:49.890 --> 00:04:53.760
Remember that he has whole speeches about how the difference between you and the

84
00:04:53.761 --> 00:04:55.830
rich is your relationship with money.

85
00:04:56.550 --> 00:05:00.540
<v 1>You see the difference between many of us and the rich,</v>

86
00:05:00.541 --> 00:05:04.260
affluent and wealthy is that the rich have a much more enlightened,

87
00:05:04.290 --> 00:05:05.790
expansive mindset.

88
00:05:05.940 --> 00:05:09.840
<v 0>Oh yes, guys, he's got an enlightened and expansive mindset of money. See,</v>

89
00:05:10.230 --> 00:05:12.420
once you get your enlightened mindset,

90
00:05:12.421 --> 00:05:15.270
you realize that scamming people is a good way to make money.

91
00:05:15.510 --> 00:05:18.300
Once you get enlightened, like Terrance jock, you realize, Hey,

92
00:05:18.360 --> 00:05:20.670
maybe I'll just forge some docs,

93
00:05:20.970 --> 00:05:24.360
maybe get some cars with dead relatives, change my name,

94
00:05:24.570 --> 00:05:27.150
then create a chairman's fund. Literally,

95
00:05:27.151 --> 00:05:31.260
what's so insane about this is that nearly everything that was publicly

96
00:05:31.261 --> 00:05:36.000
available online never would have suggested that everything he said,

97
00:05:36.030 --> 00:05:39.480
the diametrically opposite thing was true. For example,

98
00:05:39.600 --> 00:05:42.330
he said he sold his business for a ton of money,

99
00:05:42.720 --> 00:05:46.110
but we find in the sec complaint that that is not true.

100
00:05:46.170 --> 00:05:49.230
He was a convicted felon and his previous businesses had suffered financial

101
00:05:49.231 --> 00:05:50.064
difficulties.

102
00:05:50.280 --> 00:05:53.940
And until his arrest chock repeatedly attempted to prop them up through fraud.

103
00:05:54.330 --> 00:05:58.580
He calls himself a doctor, Dr. Cash. But of course that is not true.

104
00:05:58.580 --> 00:06:03.500
He never received a doctoral degree from any accredited institution. Now,

105
00:06:03.530 --> 00:06:08.210
Dr. Cash would deny that he would say he got a doctor philosophy from CIC,

106
00:06:08.211 --> 00:06:12.980
a international university and seminary with a concentration in business

107
00:06:13.010 --> 00:06:15.170
psychology. There's only one problem with that though.

108
00:06:15.171 --> 00:06:20.030
I went to CIC and they don't offer any

109
00:06:20.090 --> 00:06:23.660
degrees in business psychology. They offer a bachelor in theology.

110
00:06:23.690 --> 00:06:28.130
Master's in theology, Dr. Philosophy and theology, nothing about business.

111
00:06:28.131 --> 00:06:32.780
Isn't that interesting? The stuff is completely insane. So, uh, yeah,

112
00:06:32.810 --> 00:06:35.300
he claims to be successful. He's not successful.

113
00:06:35.301 --> 00:06:38.570
He didn't have a successful computer company. It was floundering. Um,

114
00:06:38.600 --> 00:06:41.390
he claims to be a doctor. He's not a doctor. Uh,

115
00:06:41.420 --> 00:06:44.450
he claims to be this retired guy. Instead he went to prison.

116
00:06:44.570 --> 00:06:48.170
He claimed to have this great mindset on money, but apparently yeah, again,

117
00:06:48.320 --> 00:06:52.640
convicted for financial fraud. And then also he claims you're gonna make 12%.

118
00:06:52.700 --> 00:06:55.250
And instead he's not even investing most of that money.

119
00:06:55.251 --> 00:06:59.660
Apparently most of it was used to make a combination of personal and business

120
00:06:59.661 --> 00:07:00.494
expenses,

121
00:07:00.500 --> 00:07:05.480
approximately $1.7 million to pay bills for personal credit cards,

122
00:07:06.680 --> 00:07:11.360
which is just for a guy who's preaching financial literacy.

123
00:07:11.570 --> 00:07:12.770
You're spending a lot of money.

124
00:07:13.070 --> 00:07:17.450
This is the guy who's always citing financial imprudence in all his lectures

125
00:07:17.810 --> 00:07:20.870
citing like how basketball players have a bad mindset with money.

126
00:07:20.930 --> 00:07:22.040
How can you tell it's?

127
00:07:22.041 --> 00:07:25.400
Because they're constantly spending too much money and going broke after making

128
00:07:25.401 --> 00:07:28.430
so much money. That's just evidence that people have a bad mindset of money.

129
00:07:28.870 --> 00:07:33.670
<v 2>The average NBA basketball player makes about 6.4 million per</v>

130
00:07:33.671 --> 00:07:38.350
year. Over 70% of all NBA basketball players can be broken.

131
00:07:38.740 --> 00:07:43.450
<v 0>But you're the guy who's spending $1.7 million on a personal credit card.</v>

132
00:07:43.570 --> 00:07:48.010
So moral of the story don't trust anybody

133
00:07:48.700 --> 00:07:52.870
with the name of cash, uh, doctor,

134
00:07:52.871 --> 00:07:55.330
if you can't find where they got their doctorate degree,

135
00:07:55.390 --> 00:08:00.010
don't trust anybody named million dollar billion dollar trillion dollar man.

136
00:08:00.011 --> 00:08:04.030
I mean, it's just, I don't know. This stuff is pretty obvious, but, um,

137
00:08:04.060 --> 00:08:07.090
it's worth two orthopedic guys stay safe out there.

138
00:08:07.180 --> 00:08:11.380
It's the era of COVID that scammers are running muck and luckily some of them

139
00:08:11.381 --> 00:08:15.160
are going to be going down. And when they go down, coffee,

140
00:08:15.170 --> 00:08:17.350
Zillow will be here to celebrate,

141
00:08:17.710 --> 00:08:21.370
to celebrate the conviction of just one more scammer,

142
00:08:21.460 --> 00:08:25.660
sweeping them off the street, one fraudster at a time. Thanks for watching.

143
00:08:26.530 --> 00:08:28.570
And I'll see you guys next time and don't forget.

144
00:08:28.900 --> 00:08:32.110
<v 2>Smash like and subscribe. Thank you.</v>

145
00:09:03.220 --> 00:09:03.220
