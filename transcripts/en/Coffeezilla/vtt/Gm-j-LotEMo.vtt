00:00:02.550 --> 00:00:07.140
<v 0>Boys, some of y'all are out here looking straight goofy when y'all</v>

2
00:00:07.141 --> 00:00:11.910
submit these fraudulent PPP loans and you're not sophisticated.

3
00:00:12.300 --> 00:00:14.790
You're total amateurs. You're gonna go to jail.

4
00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:17.310
<v 1>For being such an idiot.</v>

5
00:00:17.490 --> 00:00:21.180
<v 0>So today we're going to look at some of the dumbest things I've seen welcome to</v>

6
00:00:21.181 --> 00:00:22.110
the PPB Chronicle.

7
00:00:22.250 --> 00:00:24.920
<v 1>Something like the liar, but the size of that, the puppies,</v>

8
00:00:24.921 --> 00:00:27.830
and they went the cut. Oh, they went, it would be God.

9
00:00:27.831 --> 00:00:30.590
And if you have a small sloppy puppy, that is okay,

10
00:00:30.620 --> 00:00:33.440
but you must not lie to the government.

11
00:00:33.441 --> 00:00:37.100
Not the government may be a new girlfriend.

12
00:00:38.870 --> 00:00:43.820
Welcome new. The beep beep beep beep beep Chronicle.

13
00:00:44.240 --> 00:00:44.871
<v 0>Ladies and gentlemen,</v>

14
00:00:44.871 --> 00:00:48.830
welcome to the FBI building where I'm going to just recount to you the fact that

15
00:00:49.070 --> 00:00:52.460
the FBI has now gotten involved with some of these PPP fraud cases.

16
00:00:52.461 --> 00:00:56.390
They have something called the complex financial crime squad or something like

17
00:00:56.391 --> 00:01:00.470
that. It sounds much cooler than it probably is. Ladies and gentlemen,

18
00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:03.410
welcome to my presentation screen. We here at the FBI, you know,

19
00:01:04.520 --> 00:01:05.390
$10 million studio. Now,

20
00:01:05.420 --> 00:01:08.810
today we're looking at Joshua Bellamy's criminal complaint.

21
00:01:08.870 --> 00:01:13.370
Joshua Bellamy is the former NFL player. He was a wide receiver for the jets.

22
00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:14.510
So, um,

23
00:01:15.650 --> 00:01:20.420
brilliant man in the art of complex financial crimes and how

24
00:01:20.421 --> 00:01:24.410
he got caught. He had something called drip entertainment, LLC.

25
00:01:24.680 --> 00:01:27.530
And he was one of many people. Nine people were charged,

26
00:01:27.860 --> 00:01:32.240
submitting false documents and trying to get money for it from the COVID relief

27
00:01:32.241 --> 00:01:36.680
fund. And this guy got 1 million, $200,000.

28
00:01:36.860 --> 00:01:40.490
Now he got this at a time when he was broke. Apparently when he got it,

29
00:01:40.820 --> 00:01:44.270
the $1.2 million at the time in his personal account,

30
00:01:44.271 --> 00:01:48.440
he had a personal balance of $2 and 51 cents. Now I know what you're thinking.

31
00:01:48.470 --> 00:01:50.870
Poor guy. Maybe he needed the money. Well,

32
00:01:51.440 --> 00:01:56.000
he spent that $1.2 million in two months. Yeah.

33
00:01:56.210 --> 00:01:59.240
That's who we're dealing with. And was it on food? Was it on shelter? No.

34
00:02:00.020 --> 00:02:03.650
He spent it on custom jewelry, uh,

35
00:02:04.160 --> 00:02:07.970
$57,000 in custom jewelry, $38,000 on another jewelry store,

36
00:02:08.210 --> 00:02:11.630
$5,000 at Gucci, a thousand dollars. You guys get the point.

37
00:02:11.960 --> 00:02:13.910
He's trying to get the drip, drip. And, uh,

38
00:02:13.940 --> 00:02:16.430
he got caught and I don't feel bad for him about it. I mean,

39
00:02:16.431 --> 00:02:18.410
the level of this scam was so low.

40
00:02:18.580 --> 00:02:21.680
There's such amateurs at this little organization. Look at this.

41
00:02:22.250 --> 00:02:23.720
The purported company bank statement,

42
00:02:23.721 --> 00:02:28.190
which was submitted in electronic for a format is a clear forgery. First,

43
00:02:28.220 --> 00:02:30.170
according to the documents file properties,

44
00:02:30.380 --> 00:02:34.970
the statement was created using PDF filler program used

45
00:02:35.240 --> 00:02:37.010
to edit electronic PDF files.

46
00:02:37.160 --> 00:02:40.370
I bet that FBI people and all the people who investigated this were like,

47
00:02:40.640 --> 00:02:43.940
are you joking? You're trying to get one bias with PDF.

48
00:02:44.360 --> 00:02:47.960
Feller is probably like the free version or something like that and was modified

49
00:02:47.961 --> 00:02:49.970
using ITEX. Second,

50
00:02:50.210 --> 00:02:52.820
the statement is a recycled version of the same falsified bank.

51
00:02:52.821 --> 00:02:56.600
Seven statement used in other fraudulent applications submitted as part of the

52
00:02:56.990 --> 00:02:57.980
scheme. Oh my gosh.

53
00:02:58.400 --> 00:03:01.570
They're not even bothering redo documents that are submitting the same stuff.

54
00:03:01.720 --> 00:03:05.310
But as if that's enough, they then went and entrapped. This guy,

55
00:03:05.340 --> 00:03:09.150
do the FBI's crushing it up. Tell him this criminal complaint is just scathing.

56
00:03:09.450 --> 00:03:13.980
Apparently an undercover agent posed as an associate and spoke with the guy

57
00:03:14.010 --> 00:03:16.500
basically saying, Hey, I can get you a second PPB loan.

58
00:03:17.130 --> 00:03:20.580
I think this guy is jets wide receiver who just got

59
00:03:20.581 --> 00:03:24.570
$1.2 million from the government. Fraudulently would say, Hey man.

60
00:03:25.080 --> 00:03:26.720
<v 2>No, my way.</v>

61
00:03:27.640 --> 00:03:28.321
<v 0>I can't do that.</v>

62
00:03:28.321 --> 00:03:32.430
I'm not going to lie to the government in order to get more money.

63
00:03:32.460 --> 00:03:35.310
I've already stolen money from the government. But instead he goes, yeah,

64
00:03:35.340 --> 00:03:39.390
of course let's do it right. How stupid can you be?

65
00:03:40.050 --> 00:03:42.960
Let me hear, answer that question with his co-conspirator.

66
00:03:43.320 --> 00:03:45.150
His co-conspirator is a little smarter.

67
00:03:45.151 --> 00:03:49.590
It's a guy named Phillip Augustine who was investigated by the FBI.

68
00:03:49.770 --> 00:03:53.340
Now this Augustine guy tried to claim since he was just the hype man for this

69
00:03:53.341 --> 00:03:56.400
business. And he tried to claim that, look, it wasn't his doing,

70
00:03:56.401 --> 00:04:01.320
he was a victim. It says that it was CHS too. Who's just this other guy.

71
00:04:01.530 --> 00:04:05.400
Who's unnamed who submitted the application from Augustine's house using

72
00:04:05.430 --> 00:04:09.870
Augustine's computer. Your honor, I did. I,

73
00:04:09.871 --> 00:04:14.580
it may have come from my computer. The fraud may have been found on my computer,

74
00:04:14.610 --> 00:04:18.480
but I did not touch my computer. In fact,

75
00:04:19.050 --> 00:04:22.380
he later they're told, uh, prosecutors that he was,

76
00:04:22.980 --> 00:04:26.820
he was only providing documents while he was playing two games of pool and

77
00:04:26.821 --> 00:04:29.250
didn't know that any fraud was happening. Now,

78
00:04:29.251 --> 00:04:33.360
the problem with that was that they went and they checked his phone records.

79
00:04:33.390 --> 00:04:35.760
Like these people think that the government's incompetent,

80
00:04:35.761 --> 00:04:36.900
which in a lot of ways it is,

81
00:04:36.901 --> 00:04:39.720
but they think that there's no such thing as telephone records.

82
00:04:40.050 --> 00:04:42.750
And basically the telephone records paint a different picture because this

83
00:04:42.751 --> 00:04:47.430
alleged victim and the guy preparing the documents were texting back and forth

84
00:04:47.431 --> 00:04:50.880
the whole time. And why would you text back and forth from the same room?

85
00:04:51.120 --> 00:04:54.360
If one of you guys are playing pool. So it doesn't make sense.

86
00:04:54.390 --> 00:04:59.190
Not only that his signatures matched the same signatures from his bank records

87
00:04:59.191 --> 00:05:01.590
from all his private records. And so they're like, yeah,

88
00:05:01.591 --> 00:05:02.790
you definitely did this crime.

89
00:05:03.480 --> 00:05:08.190
But now because this guy lied to prosecutors because he tried to cover up his

90
00:05:08.191 --> 00:05:12.000
crime and tried to say, no, I was the victim. Look at this. In that interview,

91
00:05:12.001 --> 00:05:14.130
he falsely portrayed himself to be the victim.

92
00:05:14.400 --> 00:05:18.600
He might be getting prosecuted under obstruction of the investigation,

93
00:05:18.630 --> 00:05:20.430
which to me I'm loving it.

94
00:05:20.460 --> 00:05:24.570
I'm all here for watching these scammers get exposed. You know,

95
00:05:25.200 --> 00:05:29.040
I love this stuff. Look, you lie to the government. You lie to the Americans.

96
00:05:29.550 --> 00:05:31.740
You say you have these businesses that are saving jobs,

97
00:05:31.741 --> 00:05:35.230
you get paid and then you go blow it all. Like have you noticed? Yes,

98
00:05:35.231 --> 00:05:37.890
it's a common theme with the PPB Chronicles that all these people,

99
00:05:38.250 --> 00:05:42.270
they don't just get the loan money and then go help the poor, right?

100
00:05:42.720 --> 00:05:46.860
They don't get the loan money and go feed puppies at the, at the shelter.

101
00:05:47.700 --> 00:05:51.270
They get the loan money and spend it on custom jewelry.

102
00:05:51.660 --> 00:05:52.950
But these people have no shame.

103
00:05:52.951 --> 00:05:54.690
They don't even think they're going to get caught.

104
00:05:55.110 --> 00:05:58.160
They're too arrogant to think that they're going to caught. And when they.

105
00:05:58.160 --> 00:06:02.930
<v 3>Do, Oh, I love it.</v>

106
00:06:03.190 --> 00:06:07.090
<v 0>And just know if you're out there scamming, they're gonna catch you.</v>

107
00:06:07.091 --> 00:06:09.910
These people are not dumped while reading these case files. I was like.

108
00:06:11.800 --> 00:06:13.000
<v 3>Boy. I didn't.</v>

109
00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:16.750
<v 0>Know. They could do that. They're checking the text logs, the phone logs.</v>

110
00:06:16.960 --> 00:06:18.190
They're checking that dude.

111
00:06:18.550 --> 00:06:21.130
They're checking how many squares you use on the toilet? Trust me,

112
00:06:21.670 --> 00:06:24.550
these people know you better than you know yourself by the time they've

113
00:06:24.551 --> 00:06:27.460
investigated you. So don't think you're going to get away with it.

114
00:06:27.490 --> 00:06:30.550
You may get away with it for a little bit. You may be arrogant.

115
00:06:30.551 --> 00:06:33.550
You may be in your new bins that you just bought thinking, Oh man,

116
00:06:33.551 --> 00:06:36.850
I got away with it. Let me apply for another COVID loan. No dude,

117
00:06:37.210 --> 00:06:40.060
you just got away with it for now. You're going to get caught.

118
00:06:40.750 --> 00:06:41.860
And when they bust you,

119
00:06:42.250 --> 00:06:45.940
you will be appearing in the PPB Chronicles and we will be celebrating your

120
00:06:45.941 --> 00:06:49.900
downfall because you're stealing money anyways. That's it guys.

121
00:06:50.110 --> 00:06:51.880
Let me know what you think of the comments below. And as always.

122
00:06:51.970 --> 00:06:56.080
