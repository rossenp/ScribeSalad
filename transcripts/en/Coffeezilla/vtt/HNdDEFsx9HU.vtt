<v 0>Hello? Hello. Hello.</v>

2
00:00:02.071 --> 00:00:06.960
Welcome to another episode of revisiting my personal health for your amusement

3
00:00:07.350 --> 00:00:12.030
guys. This is the start of an accidental live stream on Thursday.

4
00:00:12.060 --> 00:00:16.800
In case you missed it two hours and 16 minutes of this could have

5
00:00:16.801 --> 00:00:19.730
been shown much worse. I'm happy to report that.

6
00:00:19.731 --> 00:00:24.020
I was basically just fixing a mic stand, but you cannot imagine the horror.

7
00:00:24.050 --> 00:00:28.400
When later I go out to dinner and I'm just live streaming, this, this text,

8
00:00:28.700 --> 00:00:33.230
what is this live stream? No signal. I say what live stream.

9
00:00:33.380 --> 00:00:37.100
And I get texted from another friend, you know, you're live, right?

10
00:00:38.180 --> 00:00:41.900
I say, uh, no. And immediately panicked because I'm thinking,

11
00:00:42.740 --> 00:00:45.560
okay, what did I do on the stream?

12
00:00:45.740 --> 00:00:48.650
Cause I must have accidentally pressed go live. I'm thinking,

13
00:00:48.680 --> 00:00:50.420
did I accidentally, you know,

14
00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:55.460
reveal my dark secret that I accidentally show my talking fan fiction.

15
00:00:55.550 --> 00:00:57.890
It was a long ride home.

16
00:00:58.100 --> 00:01:02.270
I like to imagine the emotions I was feeling was something like what Mr. Toubin

17
00:01:02.600 --> 00:01:05.990
must've been feeling when he was, uh, suddenly realized he had been live.

18
00:01:06.410 --> 00:01:09.020
Now of course I wasn't doing anything like that,

19
00:01:09.230 --> 00:01:12.980
but I was because of Susan,

20
00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:16.370
Susan and Jeff. If you stream on Twitch,

21
00:01:16.760 --> 00:01:19.820
they're out here trying to catch you. Slipping is what I read.

22
00:01:20.060 --> 00:01:21.590
I started doing some research guys.

23
00:01:21.790 --> 00:01:26.210
Do you realize that streaming live to all your fans

24
00:01:26.750 --> 00:01:28.490
is a one-click. It's a,

25
00:01:28.580 --> 00:01:32.900
all I have to do is press on OBS a little start streaming button here.

26
00:01:32.901 --> 00:01:35.360
I'll put it right here. Start streaming. That's it

27
00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:39.650
to everyone. And that's what happened.

28
00:01:39.651 --> 00:01:43.670
I was adjusting my mic and it just hit go live.

29
00:01:43.671 --> 00:01:46.040
And all of a sudden I'm on live in front of, you know,

30
00:01:46.400 --> 00:01:48.740
tens of thousands of people. I don't know how many people turned in.

31
00:01:48.950 --> 00:01:49.850
Probably probably know.

32
00:01:50.300 --> 00:01:54.260
Now you might be asking yourself what kind of user design experience doesn't

33
00:01:54.261 --> 00:01:58.880
ask. Hey, are you sure you want to go live to your entire audience right now?

34
00:01:59.150 --> 00:02:01.550
That's what you want. I think they would do. I'm pretty quickly.

35
00:02:01.551 --> 00:02:06.320
I came to one conclusion, Hey, I better do something about this.

36
00:02:06.350 --> 00:02:11.060
So I went to the office and got to work and I realized that I was far from the

37
00:02:11.061 --> 00:02:13.280
only person this has happened to. I mean,

38
00:02:13.370 --> 00:02:16.640
apparently this happens to streamers all the time.

39
00:02:16.970 --> 00:02:19.970
There's a whole category on YouTube called accidentally,

40
00:02:19.971 --> 00:02:24.380
went live of all the YouTubers who accidentally go live and embarrass themselves

41
00:02:24.381 --> 00:02:28.880
on camera because it's so easy to go live on

42
00:02:28.881 --> 00:02:32.630
accident. It's happened in Ninja. It's happened to pokey. Maine.

43
00:02:32.900 --> 00:02:36.140
Look at this guy, OMG, Chad. He was asleep,

44
00:02:36.170 --> 00:02:38.810
his cat pressed the button on his stream deck.

45
00:02:39.050 --> 00:02:40.310
And then a bunch of people called him.

46
00:02:40.311 --> 00:02:43.820
But imagine the stop that could have happened at best.

47
00:02:43.850 --> 00:02:48.440
It's embarrassing at worst it's career ending all because of the

48
00:02:48.441 --> 00:02:52.730
terrible design of going live. But my mind fool me once,

49
00:02:52.820 --> 00:02:56.360
shame on Susan, fool me twice, shame on me.

50
00:02:56.361 --> 00:03:00.100
So I was determined to create a, not just for.

51
00:03:00.100 --> 00:03:02.980
<v 1>Me, but also for streamers everywhere.</v>

52
00:03:03.130 --> 00:03:06.010
I feel like I want to create like a puppy commercial.

53
00:03:06.280 --> 00:03:09.300
Like every day a streamer's life is ruined.

54
00:03:09.390 --> 00:03:13.470
I literally mean to click start streaming by an accidental live stream.

55
00:03:18.150 --> 00:03:20.310
Do you guys remember this guy, dark side, Phil,

56
00:03:20.340 --> 00:03:23.460
this is like the worst thing that can happen to you. Uh,

57
00:03:23.490 --> 00:03:26.790
or people like Jeffrey Toobin on zoom. I mean, you know,

58
00:03:26.820 --> 00:03:31.620
I call it the getting me Tuben you get caught tug in the tube every

59
00:03:31.621 --> 00:03:36.450
day. A streamer's life gets ruined by a me tube in moment. And because of that,

60
00:03:37.260 --> 00:03:41.730
I created this product. I call it the tube switch.

61
00:03:41.970 --> 00:03:43.020
It's a little script.

62
00:03:43.080 --> 00:03:47.640
I wrote an OBS to prevent you from having these embarrassing things happen to

63
00:03:47.641 --> 00:03:49.200
you. Whenever you go live,

64
00:03:49.230 --> 00:03:53.310
it automatically switches to a warning scene of your choosing.

65
00:03:53.400 --> 00:03:57.660
This is the one I created that starts with a news alert of Jeffrey Toobin.

66
00:03:57.720 --> 00:04:01.500
Then it goes into the candid camera intro, uh, with full music.

67
00:04:01.501 --> 00:04:02.700
So you know that you're live

68
00:04:07.290 --> 00:04:10.110
[inaudible]. So if that doesn't already get your attention,

69
00:04:10.140 --> 00:04:14.100
there gets to be this tube and switch counter that automatically starts.

70
00:04:14.610 --> 00:04:16.320
It's a timer of your choosing.

71
00:04:16.830 --> 00:04:21.120
And if you have not clicked off of this scene within OBS,

72
00:04:21.420 --> 00:04:25.920
by the time that it's run down automatically OBS stops

73
00:04:25.980 --> 00:04:30.720
streaming. So it's basically a dead man switch. If you accidentally press it,

74
00:04:30.721 --> 00:04:33.810
if your cat accidentally presses it at five in the morning,

75
00:04:34.050 --> 00:04:36.480
it puts you on some innocuous scene like this.

76
00:04:36.481 --> 00:04:38.580
And then by the time the timer runs down,

77
00:04:38.760 --> 00:04:40.470
it just gets you out of the live stream.

78
00:04:40.770 --> 00:04:44.430
Now I know what you're saying to yourself. Okay, Steven. Cool, cool,

79
00:04:44.490 --> 00:04:48.840
cool program you made, uh, how much does it cost? Good question.

80
00:04:49.230 --> 00:04:51.060
Because you know, as well as I do, as Dan Locke says,

81
00:04:51.510 --> 00:04:53.340
if you're good at something, don't do it for free.

82
00:04:53.341 --> 00:04:55.710
So at first I was thinking to myself, how much should I charge for this?

83
00:04:55.740 --> 00:04:59.190
How much would people like Ninja pokey,

84
00:04:59.610 --> 00:05:02.910
Maine pay to not lose their career from getting me tube?

85
00:05:02.911 --> 00:05:07.650
And it's a good question. How much would you pay for the peace of mind?

86
00:05:08.370 --> 00:05:11.760
So at first I was thinking millions, but then I thought, no, Steven,

87
00:05:11.761 --> 00:05:15.750
you can't do that to the copy's Zillow army. They got you here.

88
00:05:16.080 --> 00:05:18.570
They want better than that. So I said,

89
00:05:18.571 --> 00:05:22.440
maybe I'll bring it down to a hundred K maybe bring it down by 90%.

90
00:05:22.890 --> 00:05:26.550
And still I felt bad. I felt it's a little expensive.

91
00:05:27.450 --> 00:05:31.470
So today limited time

92
00:05:31.530 --> 00:05:34.770
supply. There's only so many of these that can go around.

93
00:05:35.190 --> 00:05:38.040
I am offering this E product,

94
00:05:38.610 --> 00:05:42.990
not at 99% off, not at 99.9% off,

95
00:05:42.991 --> 00:05:45.570

96
00:05:46.230 --> 00:05:50.550
but I'm offering it for a hundred percent off

97
00:05:50.730 --> 00:05:55.590
