00:00:00.150 --> 00:00:03.690
<v 0>The cringe levels are off the charts. It's like staring into the eclipse. Okay.</v>

2
00:00:04.020 --> 00:00:05.910
I couldn't lie to you. It takes a lot to get through,

3
00:00:06.030 --> 00:00:07.800
but when you summit this mountain,

4
00:00:08.040 --> 00:00:09.960
you will never be the same ladies and gentlemen,

5
00:00:10.140 --> 00:00:14.760
if you can get through not one but two poems about education,

6
00:00:14.761 --> 00:00:18.240
let me say you have transcended human potential.

7
00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:20.610
You've gone beyond monk-like discipline.

8
00:00:21.360 --> 00:00:24.870
You've achieved the level of enlightenment that the Dalai Lama can only dream

9
00:00:24.871 --> 00:00:28.650
of. So please leave a comment below. If you finish this whole episode,

10
00:00:28.651 --> 00:00:31.560
I expect many of you will not be able to you'll have to tap out.

11
00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:33.960
But if you'd like to see moments like this,

12
00:00:33.990 --> 00:00:37.140
you can go subscribe to our podcast channel quick context for the video.

13
00:00:37.141 --> 00:00:40.740
So it's not immediately disorienting. We have a call in show.

14
00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:43.860
Sometimes this was one of our viewers who called in and all of a sudden he

15
00:00:43.861 --> 00:00:46.650
mentioned that he had a bunch of poems on education.

16
00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:49.530
And of course we had to hear them. I think poetry.

17
00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:52.440
And there's some pretty good job prospects there. It will give us the poetry.

18
00:00:52.880 --> 00:00:57.780
<v 1>I have one called education, frustration. Hang on here. Here. Let me, let me, I,</v>

19
00:00:57.781 --> 00:01:00.350
I have it out right now. Okay? Okay. Okay. I'm ready here.

20
00:01:01.250 --> 00:01:05.870
My school thinks that I'm a fool. It piles on rule after rule.

21
00:01:06.020 --> 00:01:10.400
At some point it was so boring. It made people drool. So uncool.

22
00:01:10.850 --> 00:01:13.850
They just told me to believe, but not to proceed.

23
00:01:14.150 --> 00:01:18.950
Never told me how to deal with the application infestation or the interview.

24
00:01:18.980 --> 00:01:23.870
Crap Stu I got good grades and it seems like I did my best in school

25
00:01:23.871 --> 00:01:24.710
for decades.

26
00:01:24.950 --> 00:01:29.870
They never prepared me for the treacherous fonts that I had to deal with in

27
00:01:29.871 --> 00:01:32.240
my job hunt. If I could go back,

28
00:01:32.480 --> 00:01:36.350
I tell some of these teachers and professors to dismiss the boring, useless,

29
00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:38.840
and unhelpful, quiet and tell them,

30
00:01:39.080 --> 00:01:43.610
tell them to shove their worthless assignments up their homework

31
00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:47.420
projects, tests bugging me like household pests.

32
00:01:47.630 --> 00:01:49.520
A good job right out of college.

33
00:01:50.210 --> 00:01:54.890
Surely they jets craft behind the school Gates and stuck behind a desk and a

34
00:01:54.891 --> 00:01:56.750
charade. So grotesque.

35
00:01:56.960 --> 00:02:01.820
Now that's the very definition of Kafka S learning cursive, cursive,

36
00:02:01.821 --> 00:02:04.700
algebra, and Shakespeare. I'm no alcoholic,

37
00:02:04.730 --> 00:02:09.080
but it made me want a beer diploma on a well, a piece of paper,

38
00:02:09.200 --> 00:02:14.180
wild they're empty promises go up and vapor standardized tests are

39
00:02:14.181 --> 00:02:15.770
one size fits. None.

40
00:02:15.950 --> 00:02:20.930
Students left behind from the lies that the system spun making us buy a

41
00:02:20.931 --> 00:02:22.130
cap and a gown.

42
00:02:22.160 --> 00:02:26.180
While student debt makes us drought that makes me want to rap,

43
00:02:26.181 --> 00:02:29.390
but frown and achieve China manufactured,

44
00:02:29.900 --> 00:02:32.180
honors medallion not fit for me.

45
00:02:32.181 --> 00:02:35.840
The leader of the revolutionary battalion from now on,

46
00:02:35.841 --> 00:02:40.760
I will do my best to get the ultimate test and become the best

47
00:02:41.360 --> 00:02:46.220
ex exposing these schooling frauds in front of the eyes of God will

48
00:02:46.221 --> 00:02:48.950
build a foundation and rise to the occasion.

49
00:02:49.340 --> 00:02:53.840
I'll go out and spread the world about these deceitful turds,

50
00:02:54.080 --> 00:02:57.290
making an inspiration for the entire nation.

51
00:02:57.500 --> 00:03:02.260
Instead of just sitting at home on my PlayStation a master's degree.

52
00:03:02.830 --> 00:03:06.460
Well, I'm the master of me, King of my own destiny,

53
00:03:06.640 --> 00:03:11.620
calling out chumps who waste our youth future. So careless to me,

54
00:03:11.650 --> 00:03:16.630
Dr. B the real doctor of philosophy saying enough with this pretentious

55
00:03:16.631 --> 00:03:20.140
Sophos street. I'm a post-grad from the school of life,

56
00:03:20.350 --> 00:03:25.150
cutting through the with my truthiness night, Republicans, Democrats,

57
00:03:25.151 --> 00:03:28.240
and all those other corrupt fat cats. They use. We,

58
00:03:28.241 --> 00:03:32.800
the people as their personal doormats, the whole education scam is nothing.

59
00:03:32.801 --> 00:03:35.380
Before you flam the policies of RD.

60
00:03:35.381 --> 00:03:40.270
Dunkin donuts are enough to make you want to go nuts in schools, healthcare,

61
00:03:40.310 --> 00:03:45.220
failing out there, prevailing, pushing the school system over the railing.

62
00:03:45.400 --> 00:03:48.070
So come with me and join my movement.

63
00:03:48.460 --> 00:03:50.920
We'll give society so much needed improvement.

64
00:04:00.210 --> 00:04:03.210
<v 2>[Inaudible] that was the cringy best thing I've ever heard in my life.</v>

65
00:04:03.240 --> 00:04:06.570
But it also was very impressive. Was that great. Eight was that bad.

66
00:04:08.210 --> 00:04:13.200
<v 1>And I have a second one. This, this one is more a job market related.</v>

67
00:04:13.860 --> 00:04:17.940
Yeah, Arnie Duncan was the secretary of education,

68
00:04:17.941 --> 00:04:22.440
but he's been flunking real life skills and job training for those. He says, no.

69
00:04:22.710 --> 00:04:27.630
What a stupid rainless, Shakespeare, algebra, and other useless crap.

70
00:04:27.660 --> 00:04:30.030
Well, that's how you end up in a worthless degree.

71
00:04:30.031 --> 00:04:35.010
Tech trap and there's ITT tech ended up in a wreck and the for-profit

72
00:04:35.011 --> 00:04:37.140
schools, milking money from students.

73
00:04:37.141 --> 00:04:41.010
They see as fool creating a generation of debtors. Isn't cool.

74
00:04:41.310 --> 00:04:46.110
Promising a decent paying job out of college. Seriously, do these idiot.

75
00:04:46.770 --> 00:04:49.980
I've no knowledge. I see a PhD in philosophy,

76
00:04:49.981 --> 00:04:52.230
serving coffee at Starbucks.

77
00:04:52.440 --> 00:04:56.010
While these babies school couldn't give less of a.

78
00:04:57.000 --> 00:05:01.320
They send her resume on Craigslist, no responses. It's making me.

79
00:05:02.130 --> 00:05:07.080
Then they call back and it's time to cue the laugh track of description

80
00:05:07.140 --> 00:05:10.410
administrative low.

81
00:05:10.470 --> 00:05:13.530
It makes my stomach churn show up for an interview.

82
00:05:13.920 --> 00:05:16.620
Dress up in your suit and tie hoping you don't get an.

83
00:05:17.130 --> 00:05:20.910
Interviewer who makes you want to cry? First thing the guy says is,

84
00:05:20.970 --> 00:05:25.380
Oh boy, do you agree? How nice? What about skills? And I say,

85
00:05:25.710 --> 00:05:29.490
hold up skills. Well, I can graph X. And Y does that fit the bill?

86
00:05:29.730 --> 00:05:33.630
He laughs in my face, proving the education systems in disgrace.

87
00:05:33.870 --> 00:05:37.080
What's the job description I inquire. He says,

88
00:05:37.081 --> 00:05:41.880
kissing my all day and catering to my every desire is this,

89
00:05:41.910 --> 00:05:43.320
all this Turk and say,

90
00:05:43.560 --> 00:05:47.520
I tell him what you better get your head out of your butt and the poop out of

91
00:05:47.521 --> 00:05:50.430
your ears. No way are you, Oh,

92
00:05:50.520 --> 00:05:53.190
this isn't what I've been preparing for all

93
00:05:56.580 --> 00:05:58.700
my money. By making you look funny,

94
00:05:58.850 --> 00:06:03.650
I don't accept your job because I've got spunk and your BS makes you stink like

95
00:06:03.651 --> 00:06:08.330
a skunk. The only place you belong is in the gum. My Opus morons,

96
00:06:08.450 --> 00:06:12.560
who don't think I know how to get a simple job done. Well, it's a good thing.

97
00:06:12.561 --> 00:06:15.560
I'm at the poetry lounge. We know how to have fun.

98
00:06:16.120 --> 00:06:19.750
<v 3>So short haul, cruise blogging, port.</v>

99
00:06:20.500 --> 00:06:22.930
<v 1>Schools and job market are failing,</v>

100
00:06:22.990 --> 00:06:27.070
but I'm still prevailing using my comedy to push the whole corrupt system over

101
00:06:27.071 --> 00:06:31.240
the railing. So join me and let's make the movement. It's about time.

102
00:06:31.241 --> 00:06:33.040
We petition these people to make something.

103
00:06:34.460 --> 00:06:35.180
<v 3>Wow.</v>
