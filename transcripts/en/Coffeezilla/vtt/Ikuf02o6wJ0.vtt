WEBVTT

1
00:00:00.090 --> 00:00:03.150
<v 0>Here in my garage just bought this new Lamborghini here,</v>

2
00:00:03.151 --> 00:00:07.350
but you know what I like more than Lamborghini's knowledge did

3
00:00:08.580 --> 00:00:12.810
and webinar Wednesday guys,

4
00:00:12.811 --> 00:00:15.840
welcome to a segment of the show where we get scammed.

5
00:00:15.841 --> 00:00:18.780
So you don't have to in the past, when talking about gurus,

6
00:00:18.810 --> 00:00:20.940
I've talked about their marketing. I've done that stuff.

7
00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:23.820
I've traditionally strayed away from going into their course.

8
00:00:24.780 --> 00:00:28.050
Partly because I don't want to spend $2,000 also,

9
00:00:28.051 --> 00:00:31.290
partly because it's hard to show that because it's behind a pay wall by I

10
00:00:31.291 --> 00:00:33.060
decided I would do it anyways.

11
00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:36.780
And we're going to have to find a way to just summarize this for you and try to

12
00:00:36.781 --> 00:00:39.420
get the idea to you without actually showing the content.

13
00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:43.080
And our first guru is the grand Pappy of all gurus.

14
00:00:43.081 --> 00:00:46.500
The guy who had the brilliant idea to pretend he knows something on YouTube,

15
00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:49.650
get a bunch of poor, broke, desperate people to pay him a lot of money,

16
00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:52.740
and then try to leverage that into an actual legitimate business.

17
00:00:52.741 --> 00:00:55.200
I think Ty Lopez is now trying to like buy real businesses.

18
00:00:55.201 --> 00:00:56.130
We'll see how that goes.

19
00:00:56.370 --> 00:00:59.700
But he got his real start with this whole internet marketer thing.

20
00:00:59.970 --> 00:01:03.600
I'm like this genius guru who knows the secret of health, wealth, and happiness.

21
00:01:03.810 --> 00:01:04.830
You guys all know the app.

22
00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:08.960
<v 1>Here in my garage just bought this a new Lamborghini here, but you know what?</v>

23
00:01:08.961 --> 00:01:11.900
I like a lot more than materialistic things, knowledge.

24
00:01:12.710 --> 00:01:16.460
<v 0>But today we're going to be dissecting what happens behind the chorus,</v>

25
00:01:16.461 --> 00:01:20.630
behind the pay wall. So bring down the screen

26
00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:26.810
always feels like that's going to hit me. Okay guys, 67 steps to success.

27
00:01:27.140 --> 00:01:28.670
This is a, what he kicked it off with.

28
00:01:28.671 --> 00:01:30.830
I believe you guys are gonna tell me if I'm wrong there,

29
00:01:31.040 --> 00:01:34.040
but we're going to be going through a few things. Okay? When reviewing this,

30
00:01:34.041 --> 00:01:36.920
we're going to talk about the price. We're going to talk about what I like,

31
00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:40.010
what I don't like. Should you buy this course? The full review,

32
00:01:40.040 --> 00:01:44.210
all that stuff now to start with the price, uh,

33
00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:48.920
67 bucks is what I found at four with a $67 renewal.

34
00:01:48.980 --> 00:01:50.510
If you don't cancel, cancel,

35
00:01:50.570 --> 00:01:54.440
I think that's probably pretty mid range to low range.

36
00:01:54.441 --> 00:01:57.770
I think that's like sort of more of a trip wire product was trying to get you in

37
00:01:57.771 --> 00:02:01.400
the Ty Lopez funnel system. And indeed a lot during the course,

38
00:02:01.401 --> 00:02:04.430
you're hearing him talk about the upsells. If you're part of this closing group,

39
00:02:04.431 --> 00:02:07.940
if you're part of this mastermind, you should buy this upsell.

40
00:02:08.120 --> 00:02:11.240
And he always says, Oh, I don't actually want the money. No, no, no, no.

41
00:02:11.241 --> 00:02:14.420
I don't want the money guys. I do it for you. So you pay attention.

42
00:02:14.600 --> 00:02:18.050
You're not going to pay attention to less unless you open up that wallet, baby.

43
00:02:18.350 --> 00:02:20.690
So that's the price now onto the course itself.

44
00:02:20.691 --> 00:02:25.580
The first thing you should know about this course by Mr. Perez is that it's

45
00:02:25.581 --> 00:02:29.150
very, very, very long it's 50 hours long,

46
00:02:29.180 --> 00:02:33.260
which if you're looking for value might seem like a good thing,

47
00:02:33.380 --> 00:02:37.340
but unfortunately 50 hours does not mean 50 hours of good

48
00:02:37.820 --> 00:02:41.480
content. It means 50 hours of Tai Lopez. Basically.

49
00:02:41.481 --> 00:02:44.780
Bloviating about little anecdotes in his life. I mean,

50
00:02:44.810 --> 00:02:46.340
nothing of this felt prepared.

51
00:02:46.340 --> 00:02:50.630
It felt like he just had three points and his goal was to hit like a 30 minute

52
00:02:50.631 --> 00:02:55.010
marker or like an hour long marker. The amount of just kind of like, um, uh,

53
00:02:55.011 --> 00:02:59.000
what, where was I going with? This is ridiculous. Luckily I, you,

54
00:02:59.080 --> 00:03:01.450
I was gonna feel bad and watch the full 50 hours,

55
00:03:01.451 --> 00:03:03.700
but Ty Lopez made me feel better.

56
00:03:03.730 --> 00:03:07.150
And this might be the only takeaway that I got from his course was during the

57
00:03:07.151 --> 00:03:10.480
speed reading portion. Now we all know Ty Lopez. He's the King of reading.

58
00:03:10.750 --> 00:03:12.550
Write one book a day. Well,

59
00:03:12.551 --> 00:03:15.940
actually it turns out he doesn't read one book a day. He does something.

60
00:03:15.941 --> 00:03:20.170
He likes to call speed skims a book a day,

61
00:03:20.410 --> 00:03:24.970
which might mean reading it for five minutes, reading it for 10 minutes,

62
00:03:24.971 --> 00:03:29.530
15 minutes now, but basically anything but read it all the way through.

63
00:03:30.670 --> 00:03:34.630
Uh, and this is his rationale behind it. I want to get away from stories.

64
00:03:35.130 --> 00:03:39.900
<v 2>Stories are what, how authors fill up the pages of a book. So, you know.</v>

65
00:03:40.530 --> 00:03:43.290
<v 0>Yeah, that's exactly what Tyler has did in this course.</v>

66
00:03:43.950 --> 00:03:45.960
<v 2>They're just trying to sell their book. They don't want to sell,</v>

67
00:03:46.290 --> 00:03:49.470
most authors could write a 10 page book with everything.

68
00:03:49.471 --> 00:03:50.520
They know the cliff notes,

69
00:03:50.550 --> 00:03:54.270
but they don't want to do that because they can't charge you 20 bucks for it.

70
00:03:54.660 --> 00:03:56.790
<v 0>Yeah. The irony here is palpable.</v>

71
00:03:56.791 --> 00:03:59.580
And that's when I realized I'm not going to sit through all of this, uh,

72
00:03:59.610 --> 00:04:02.580
Ty Lopez justifying a $67 course instead,

73
00:04:02.581 --> 00:04:04.770
I'll just get like the main high-level points,

74
00:04:05.190 --> 00:04:08.940
because really it boils down to an each lesson he's got 67 lessons.

75
00:04:09.210 --> 00:04:13.740
It comes down to like one thing or like maybe one or two ideas. Uh,

76
00:04:13.800 --> 00:04:15.810
and this is where we come to,

77
00:04:15.900 --> 00:04:18.720
I guess the good thing and the bad thing of the course now,

78
00:04:19.050 --> 00:04:21.450
what do I like about Ty Lopez? He encourages reading.

79
00:04:21.480 --> 00:04:24.150
I'm never going to hate on a guy that encourages reading baby.

80
00:04:24.151 --> 00:04:26.400
It's the best mechanism to self-improvement.

81
00:04:26.401 --> 00:04:29.220
It's what I tell you guys to keep doing. I probably don't say it enough.

82
00:04:29.280 --> 00:04:33.180
If you have a library card, you don't need any of these idiots. Right?

83
00:04:33.540 --> 00:04:36.540
What I'm trying to tell you, you can get way deeper ideas.

84
00:04:36.870 --> 00:04:38.730
You can improve the quality of your thinking,

85
00:04:38.731 --> 00:04:42.720
the clarity of your thinking all for an incredibly low price.

86
00:04:43.020 --> 00:04:44.520
So I like that about him.

87
00:04:44.550 --> 00:04:47.460
Hopefully he encourages people to read even his book list.

88
00:04:47.461 --> 00:04:49.680
I have no problem with. I thought his booklet is pretty good.

89
00:04:49.990 --> 00:04:53.610
Read a lot of the books on there and I would wholeheartedly endorse a lot of

90
00:04:53.611 --> 00:04:58.290
them now, what do I not like? Well, this whole course,

91
00:04:58.530 --> 00:05:00.000
and this would be sort of,

92
00:05:00.060 --> 00:05:02.280
this is getting into like the really rating part of it.

93
00:05:03.130 --> 00:05:07.950
The whole course is reheated self-help Tai Lopez speed,

94
00:05:07.951 --> 00:05:12.630
read the Barnes and noble self-help section and put it into 50 hours of content.

95
00:05:12.690 --> 00:05:17.250
Okay. 50 hours of him just telling little stories about a grandpa,

96
00:05:17.280 --> 00:05:21.870
Joel Salitan or whatever, which by the way, is this man a farmer or isn't he,

97
00:05:21.871 --> 00:05:25.350
I recently saw a video where he's approaching a horse from behind.

98
00:05:25.530 --> 00:05:26.700
<v 2>How did I not know this?</v>

99
00:05:29.970 --> 00:05:32.580
<v 0>But we're supposed to believe he's a farmer. Cause he's got a hat on.</v>

100
00:05:32.730 --> 00:05:35.940
Like I'm not even a farmer. And even I know that. Look, can I be a farmer too?

101
00:05:35.941 --> 00:05:40.140
Now that I got, I put a straw hat on, this is ridiculous. But anyways,

102
00:05:40.500 --> 00:05:43.710
that's the biggest problem is that if you've read self-help,

103
00:05:43.770 --> 00:05:48.210
if you've cracked open three, four, five books from the self-help section,

104
00:05:48.240 --> 00:05:52.980
you already know all this stuff and you have it from the source material where

105
00:05:52.981 --> 00:05:56.700
people have spent years crafting together, like the,

106
00:05:57.740 --> 00:06:02.030
of decades of experience, right into one or two really crystallized ideas.

107
00:06:02.390 --> 00:06:06.860
Or you can have a guy who read it for 15 minutes at the breakfast table,

108
00:06:06.890 --> 00:06:09.710
regurgitate it to you over an hour. I mean,

109
00:06:10.550 --> 00:06:12.020
I think the difference is clear.

110
00:06:12.021 --> 00:06:16.970
And this is like where the value proposition becomes kind of weak is that really

111
00:06:16.971 --> 00:06:20.780
he's just regurgitating ideas all the while saying that you should read.

112
00:06:20.781 --> 00:06:25.730
But if you read then the value of Tai Lopez's course basically goes to zero. Uh,

113
00:06:25.790 --> 00:06:27.290
and if you just listen to summaries,

114
00:06:27.320 --> 00:06:30.320
then you're kind of doing what Tai Lopez is saying not to do,

115
00:06:30.560 --> 00:06:32.210
which is to be a dilettante.

116
00:06:32.480 --> 00:06:37.100
Another incredibly ironic part of this course is he talks a lot about how you

117
00:06:37.101 --> 00:06:40.550
need to drink deeply from the well of knowledge.

118
00:06:40.970 --> 00:06:44.360
But Ty Lopez seems very interested in not drinking deeply from the well of

119
00:06:44.361 --> 00:06:47.570
knowledge instead of drinking very widely from the well of knowledge.

120
00:06:48.280 --> 00:06:51.550
<v 3>I don't know don't become a Dilla taunt.</v>

121
00:06:51.820 --> 00:06:55.900
And now the next thing I want to talk about is listening to dilettantes.

122
00:06:56.440 --> 00:06:58.600
See dilettantes are usually the loudest.

123
00:06:59.200 --> 00:07:02.770
<v 0>Oh, by the way, if you guys don't know a ton is a fancy way of saying amateur,</v>

124
00:07:02.830 --> 00:07:07.120
someone who's just read very, just skim the surface. Um,

125
00:07:07.180 --> 00:07:10.990
and Ty Lopez, his literal approach to reading is speed skimming.

126
00:07:11.350 --> 00:07:15.310
So his message is don't listen to dilettantes.

127
00:07:15.340 --> 00:07:19.660
Don't be a dilettante, uh, which I agree a lot with.

128
00:07:19.690 --> 00:07:23.800
But the problem is is that Ty Lopez is a dilatory telling you not to listen to

129
00:07:23.801 --> 00:07:28.750
dilettantes once again, I don't know how you get away from the irony here.

130
00:07:28.900 --> 00:07:29.980
I would also say here,

131
00:07:29.981 --> 00:07:34.840
as an aside on the reading proposition is that this idea he calls it strip

132
00:07:34.841 --> 00:07:36.460
mining, like you're mining for gold.

133
00:07:36.461 --> 00:07:38.710
You only want the gold only look for the gold in the book.

134
00:07:38.711 --> 00:07:40.270
And as soon as you get it, you like put the book down.

135
00:07:40.271 --> 00:07:41.500
You don't care about that book anymore.

136
00:07:42.190 --> 00:07:46.390
I think it applies to like a certain class of business book, but honestly,

137
00:07:46.570 --> 00:07:51.070
most self-help isn't about getting as many ideas into your head as possible,

138
00:07:51.250 --> 00:07:54.280
which I think is what he does. He like conflates,

139
00:07:54.310 --> 00:07:58.840
just reading a lot of ideas with being really smart. But in actuality,

140
00:07:58.870 --> 00:08:01.660
it's internalizing those ideas and applying them to your life.

141
00:08:01.720 --> 00:08:02.890
That is the only thing that matters,

142
00:08:03.130 --> 00:08:07.630
which is why a lot of people can watch hundreds of high class performers share

143
00:08:07.631 --> 00:08:11.230
their biggest ideas and they never become a high class performer themselves is

144
00:08:11.231 --> 00:08:14.800
because you can take an ideas without actually getting out of it.

145
00:08:14.801 --> 00:08:17.380
What they're actually saying, you're not actually internalizing the ideas.

146
00:08:17.381 --> 00:08:22.240
And I think strip mining is the absolute way to make this mistake is by not

147
00:08:22.241 --> 00:08:25.360
really spending time in the idea of like, literally just like, Oh my gosh,

148
00:08:25.390 --> 00:08:28.150
what's this, this is what his idea of speed's giving is. Oh,

149
00:08:28.210 --> 00:08:31.360
look through the book up, got that book. It's gone. That's the idea.

150
00:08:31.361 --> 00:08:34.750
It's a little dumb. I think there's a time for reading broadly,

151
00:08:34.751 --> 00:08:39.070
but eventually if, if what I'm getting actually what he's saying,

152
00:08:39.310 --> 00:08:42.130
like you should actually read deeply didn't that's not how you do it.

153
00:08:42.130 --> 00:08:45.580
So it felt a little confused there. Now,

154
00:08:45.581 --> 00:08:49.300
if you find any of this ironic, uh, you're not the only one.

155
00:08:49.301 --> 00:08:53.950
And I think the best way I can explain it is that you could actually learn a lot

156
00:08:53.980 --> 00:08:58.080
from Ty Lopez. I'm not joking by watching what he does,

157
00:08:58.140 --> 00:09:02.880
not what he tells you to do. So I think if you watch his, his, uh, original ad,

158
00:09:02.970 --> 00:09:03.990
you know, here in my garage,

159
00:09:04.260 --> 00:09:08.400
you could learn an amazing amount about sales and marketing from that,

160
00:09:08.820 --> 00:09:11.550
right from that, if you actually read like Ty Lopez reads,

161
00:09:11.551 --> 00:09:14.790
because even though he obviously schemes a lot of books, he is well read.

162
00:09:15.510 --> 00:09:17.250
I think you'd be fine. I think you do well.

163
00:09:17.280 --> 00:09:22.110
I think the problem is is that what Tai Lopez does and what he says to

164
00:09:22.111 --> 00:09:26.040
do are two different things, which leads to a very interesting thing.

165
00:09:26.041 --> 00:09:29.070
When you're watching him tell you his life advice, because you're kind of like,

166
00:09:29.100 --> 00:09:31.020
Oh, wait, didn't you do that to us. Oh wait,

167
00:09:31.110 --> 00:09:33.750
did aren't you using these tricks on us? Like take, for example,

168
00:09:33.751 --> 00:09:36.990
his part where he's saying don't be the sucker in the room while talking to a

169
00:09:36.991 --> 00:09:41.730
bunch of people who bought some reheated set of ideas that were from a bunch of

170
00:09:41.731 --> 00:09:44.580
people that they should have just read instead of watch Tai Lopez's course.

171
00:09:45.050 --> 00:09:49.640
<v 2>What beyond you just consciously going,</v>

172
00:09:49.790 --> 00:09:51.500
I'm not going to be the sucker in the room. Right?

173
00:09:51.920 --> 00:09:55.760
You make that conscious decision. It doesn't mean you won't be the sucker.

174
00:09:56.180 --> 00:10:00.680
<v 0>Like I can't explain to you how funny this is to me that he's saying this,</v>

175
00:10:00.681 --> 00:10:02.150
but okay. Let's keep going.

176
00:10:02.660 --> 00:10:06.830
<v 2>Conscious changes are well, like Freud said,</v>

177
00:10:07.250 --> 00:10:11.300
the mind is like a iceberg.

178
00:10:12.200 --> 00:10:15.500
90% of it is below the water in your subconscious.

179
00:10:15.501 --> 00:10:18.920
So the Lollapalooza effect now.

180
00:10:19.460 --> 00:10:20.720
<v 0>He's really jumping around here.</v>

181
00:10:20.990 --> 00:10:25.670
What he's quoting now is a Charlie Munger thing, Lollapalooza effect, basically,

182
00:10:26.000 --> 00:10:29.990
it's the idea that cognitive biases stack on top of each other, uh,

183
00:10:30.020 --> 00:10:34.070
to produce a much greater result, small biases can stack on top of each other.

184
00:10:34.430 --> 00:10:37.100
And he's going to basically say, don't do it.

185
00:10:37.130 --> 00:10:39.560
Don't avoid Lollapalooza effect.

186
00:10:40.670 --> 00:10:44.600
<v 2>Okay. Oh, well there's a lot in the ultimate closing system,</v>

187
00:10:44.900 --> 00:10:48.350
sales green belt stuff. And you might not be in that.

188
00:10:48.500 --> 00:10:49.880
If you're in an entrepreneurial,

189
00:10:50.270 --> 00:10:54.680
definitely should check that out because have best thing you always lose at an

190
00:10:54.681 --> 00:10:58.370
auction. Think of what happens to you. You walk into an auction,

191
00:10:59.480 --> 00:11:01.310
there's a person on stage

192
00:11:03.110 --> 00:11:06.710
stack is of the authority bias. So automatically even subconsciously,

193
00:11:07.280 --> 00:11:10.760
they are perceived by your subconscious as an authority because they're

194
00:11:10.790 --> 00:11:15.260
literally physically above you. Then they're doing things like going once,

195
00:11:15.261 --> 00:11:19.550
going twice, they're creating scarcity and urgency. Like, Ooh,

196
00:11:19.790 --> 00:11:22.490
if I don't buy this right now, I'm going to lose it.

197
00:11:22.520 --> 00:11:27.020
Even though it's something you've lived your whole life perfectly well with, uh,

198
00:11:27.080 --> 00:11:29.750
you know, perfectly well before you even heard of it,

199
00:11:30.230 --> 00:11:34.370
it's still an influence on all these things added together.

200
00:11:34.430 --> 00:11:38.240
Create what Charlie Munger has coined the Lollapalooza effect.

201
00:11:38.270 --> 00:11:41.720
And the Lollapalooza effect is a forest too powerful,

202
00:11:42.320 --> 00:11:46.460
a coalescing of multiple biases

203
00:11:47.330 --> 00:11:48.320
all at once.

204
00:11:48.860 --> 00:11:53.350
And that is why they say they don't even put themselves in that

205
00:11:53.440 --> 00:11:58.330
situation. It's not something you can build up willpower around.

206
00:11:58.690 --> 00:12:00.610
<v 0>Okay? So all of that to say, he's saying, look,</v>

207
00:12:00.690 --> 00:12:03.390
don't get around things that prey on multi of your cognitive biases,

208
00:12:03.540 --> 00:12:05.640
cause you don't have enough willpower to withstand it. It's just,

209
00:12:05.641 --> 00:12:09.570
you're going to lose every time. This is what a webinar is.

210
00:12:09.600 --> 00:12:13.470
Guidance is what Tai Lopez's ads do is they're

211
00:12:14.790 --> 00:12:19.770
Lollapalooza, Wonderland, it's scarcity, it's appeal to social proof. It's like,

212
00:12:19.980 --> 00:12:22.560
look at all the testimonials. It's all of these, Oh,

213
00:12:22.561 --> 00:12:25.680
it's prerecorded live webinars, guys. This is all for you.

214
00:12:25.681 --> 00:12:29.490
I did this just for you. They're professional marketers. That's what they do.

215
00:12:29.491 --> 00:12:33.390
And so Ty Lopez in a class that you got sold to with the lollipops who's effect

216
00:12:33.420 --> 00:12:37.470
is saying, don't fall for this effect. So again,

217
00:12:37.950 --> 00:12:42.810
we're left thinking, okay, Thai, what is this? It's like a course for suckers.

218
00:12:42.811 --> 00:12:45.090
How not to get it suckered in the first lesson is what you've already been

219
00:12:45.091 --> 00:12:45.430
suckered.

220
00:12:45.430 --> 00:12:49.950
So you're a sucker it's like bizarre to watch this and watch him say like,

221
00:12:49.980 --> 00:12:52.470
Oh yeah, you should try to avoid these situations at possible.

222
00:12:52.950 --> 00:12:56.790
Ty Lopez is webinars and all these marketers webinars are the thing that he's

223
00:12:56.791 --> 00:12:58.710
talking about. And not only that,

224
00:12:58.711 --> 00:13:03.210
he's also simultaneously saying that you're the sucker in the room. So yeah,

225
00:13:03.480 --> 00:13:08.160
that's how I felt this whole entire course rich with like sort of

226
00:13:08.190 --> 00:13:12.300
irony. And though he had some good ideas that like I agree with and I've,

227
00:13:13.080 --> 00:13:15.660
Kernelized myself, they're all from books, right?

228
00:13:15.690 --> 00:13:17.730
They're all from books that most people,

229
00:13:17.731 --> 00:13:21.870
if you just go through the basic reading list of a self-help section,

230
00:13:22.110 --> 00:13:25.020
you're going to learn are the basics of a business book section you're going to

231
00:13:25.021 --> 00:13:25.800
learn.

232
00:13:25.800 --> 00:13:29.070
And this guy is basically projecting himself to be the authority on all these

233
00:13:29.071 --> 00:13:33.000
topics. Despite reading just very broadly on all of them. And then he says,

234
00:13:33.001 --> 00:13:36.960
don't listen to dilettantes. So I don't know, take from that.

235
00:13:36.961 --> 00:13:39.990
What you will all in all rating, let's get to a rating.

236
00:13:40.200 --> 00:13:43.470
I think you guys get the picture. Uh,

237
00:13:44.310 --> 00:13:49.110
I would go ahead and give this out of five stars. Uh, 1.5,

238
00:13:49.410 --> 00:13:51.120
I would say, you know,

239
00:13:51.150 --> 00:13:54.150
the marketing was over-hyped if you thought this was going to lead to a good

240
00:13:54.151 --> 00:13:56.370
life really quick, obviously it does not.

241
00:13:56.371 --> 00:13:58.200
So it doesn't fulfill its side of the marketing.

242
00:13:58.920 --> 00:14:02.730
It's just a bunch of like common sense frameworks that most people would know.

243
00:14:03.000 --> 00:14:06.030
I think the person who should buy this, though, I'm going to give you,

244
00:14:06.260 --> 00:14:09.000
somebody should buy this. If you like Ty Lopez, uh,

245
00:14:09.030 --> 00:14:12.210
and you realize the marketing's misleading and you've never read the self-help

246
00:14:12.211 --> 00:14:17.070
section before and you want a broad swath of it regurgitated through

247
00:14:17.071 --> 00:14:19.080
some long-winded rant, right? Uh,

248
00:14:19.110 --> 00:14:22.080
maybe you have a lot of listening you need to be doing and you can't stand the

249
00:14:22.081 --> 00:14:25.410
voice of anyone by Ty Lopez. This might be a good course for you. You know,

250
00:14:26.070 --> 00:14:29.970
if you want to avoid the source material and just listen to Ty Lopez,

251
00:14:30.510 --> 00:14:32.730
this may be a good course for you, but.

252
00:14:33.330 --> 00:14:34.860
<v 2>For the rest, the rest of you.</v>

253
00:14:35.580 --> 00:14:40.200
<v 0>Yeah. I would say, save your money, get a library card and be, well,</v>

254
00:14:40.380 --> 00:14:42.480
I think that's going to about do it.

255
00:14:42.510 --> 00:14:45.570
Thanks for coming to this episode of webinars Wednesday.

256
00:14:45.571 --> 00:14:47.490
Tell me if you liked it, tell me if you hated it.

257
00:14:47.491 --> 00:14:51.560
Tell me if you want to see more, who do you want to see next week on webinar,

258
