00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:03.360
<v 0>Ladies and gentlemen, I just had the best podcast of my life.</v>

2
00:00:03.680 --> 00:00:08.180
<v 1>The line between insanity and genius is a</v>

3
00:00:08.181 --> 00:00:11.720
very fine line.

4
00:00:11.870 --> 00:00:15.380
I'm not wearing pants. This was a souvenir from,

5
00:00:15.560 --> 00:00:19.760
from one of my that's not what I, that's not what I should be a mean face.

6
00:00:19.790 --> 00:00:21.320
And it says they didn't done it.

7
00:00:22.130 --> 00:00:25.910
<v 0>And unfortunately, no one will be able to see it because of Brian Rose guys.</v>

8
00:00:25.911 --> 00:00:27.350
The age old question happened,

9
00:00:27.740 --> 00:00:32.570
what happens when someone who will die for free speech meets a

10
00:00:32.571 --> 00:00:35.360
fragile ego that can't handle any criticism.

11
00:00:40.880 --> 00:00:42.380
Ocracy. I don't know how else to say it. Guys.

12
00:00:42.381 --> 00:00:46.160
We just got copyright claimed by London real TV.

13
00:00:46.190 --> 00:00:50.810
This is Mr. Free speech. The guy who wants no censorship of any kind.

14
00:00:50.870 --> 00:00:54.170
I don't know if you remember this. Maybe you remember his little tagline.

15
00:00:54.530 --> 00:00:56.870
<v 2>You know, I might not agree with everything you have to say.</v>

16
00:00:57.200 --> 00:00:58.820
I don't agree with everything you say.

17
00:00:58.880 --> 00:01:02.360
I might not agree with everything you say, but I will defend to the death.

18
00:01:02.390 --> 00:01:05.120
I will defend to the death, your right to say it. Yeah.

19
00:01:06.590 --> 00:01:08.510
<v 0>Brian, I may not agree with everything you say about it.</v>

20
00:01:08.570 --> 00:01:12.860
I'll defend to the death, your right to say it Rose censored us on our show.

21
00:01:12.890 --> 00:01:15.770
And probably even more disgusting is the fact that he's made a bunch of

22
00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:18.590
influencers. Think that he's the King of free speech. Look at this guy.

23
00:01:18.650 --> 00:01:20.900
This guy right here has like 2 million subscribers.

24
00:01:20.901 --> 00:01:23.990
And he thinks that Brian Rose is the first one to ever come up with this idea of

25
00:01:23.991 --> 00:01:26.390
free speech here, Brian Rose,

26
00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:31.280
I may not agree with everything you have to say, but I will defend to the death,

27
00:01:31.310 --> 00:01:35.420
your right to say it, Hey that wasn't praying Rose who came up with that.

28
00:01:35.630 --> 00:01:38.780
Pretty sure it's like Voltaire, but we're dealing with this guy. And he says,

29
00:01:38.781 --> 00:01:43.310
you know, Oh, I'm the modern free speech warrior. You know, you can trust me.

30
00:01:43.311 --> 00:01:44.360
You can donate to me.

31
00:01:44.361 --> 00:01:47.720
He's taken millions of dollars to build a digital freedom platform free of

32
00:01:47.721 --> 00:01:51.260
censorship, right? Except he's censoring other people.

33
00:01:51.680 --> 00:01:54.290
Now you might be saying to yourself, Steven had a, you know,

34
00:01:54.500 --> 00:01:57.920
maybe it was just an honest mistake. It's all a big coincidence. Well,

35
00:01:57.921 --> 00:02:01.160
we actually have precedents for that. He's done this to other creators too,

36
00:02:01.161 --> 00:02:04.790
who have been critical of him. This is rebel wisdom who I did a video with.

37
00:02:04.940 --> 00:02:08.450
He also faced the wrath of, uh, Brian Rose. And uh,

38
00:02:08.480 --> 00:02:11.570
he also got censored shoot, a copyright claim,

39
00:02:11.600 --> 00:02:16.460
got many of our investigations taken down and also a copyright strike

40
00:02:16.490 --> 00:02:19.220
against rebel wisdom. If you're just saying an average guy,

41
00:02:19.221 --> 00:02:21.080
you've never taken a stance on free speech.

42
00:02:21.290 --> 00:02:23.510
Maybe it's understandable that you get offended.

43
00:02:23.720 --> 00:02:27.020
You just in the heat of the moment you take down someone's content.

44
00:02:27.350 --> 00:02:31.730
But to be the guy always claiming to be Mr. Free speech,

45
00:02:31.820 --> 00:02:35.780
always claiming that you're so above censorship. In fact,

46
00:02:35.781 --> 00:02:40.730
you raised millions of dollars to be above censorship for you to go and be that

47
00:02:40.731 --> 00:02:43.760
guy to then go and use the copyright system like this.

48
00:02:43.761 --> 00:02:47.900
When it was clearly fair use, we were commenting on his little Kung Fu movie,

49
00:02:47.901 --> 00:02:48.740
the entire time,

50
00:02:48.830 --> 00:02:53.420
transforming the content the entire time for you to sensor that that is pure and

51
00:02:53.421 --> 00:02:54.650
total hypocrisy.

52
00:02:55.640 --> 00:02:56.510
<v 2>Freedom of speeches.</v>

53
00:02:57.170 --> 00:03:00.910
It really means freedom of speech for things you don't want to hear out of other

54
00:03:00.911 --> 00:03:01.744
people's minds.

55
00:03:06.450 --> 00:03:07.380
<v 1>Oh.</v>

56
00:03:07.530 --> 00:03:11.700
<v 0>The sheer cognitive dissonance of these two stances is too much for me to bear,</v>

57
00:03:11.701 --> 00:03:12.090
bro.

58
00:03:12.090 --> 00:03:16.170
<v 2>It's really easy to say. I can say what I want, but the question is,</v>

59
00:03:16.171 --> 00:03:18.750
like you said, will you defend to the death?

60
00:03:18.810 --> 00:03:22.290
Someone else's right to say something you fundamentally disagree with.

61
00:03:22.380 --> 00:03:26.670
<v 0>Guys. I don't know what else to say. I think we need a place free of censorship.</v>

62
00:03:26.940 --> 00:03:29.610
I think we need, I think YouTube is not enough, right? YouTube.

63
00:03:29.611 --> 00:03:31.380
Just lets anyone take down your video for any reason.

64
00:03:31.381 --> 00:03:36.180
I think we need something better bit. Shoot, no library,

65
00:03:36.210 --> 00:03:37.590
no story fire. No,

66
00:03:37.620 --> 00:03:41.820
I think we need our own digital freedom

67
00:03:42.060 --> 00:03:45.060
platform. That's why today. I'm like.

68
00:03:45.930 --> 00:03:48.210
<v 1>I'm just kidding. What did that be? Hilarious.</v>

69
00:03:48.780 --> 00:03:51.030
<v 0>Our own rival digital freedom platform company though,</v>

70
00:03:51.120 --> 00:03:55.890
just to put up that one video of us make fun of Brian's

71
00:03:57.030 --> 00:03:58.920
karate movie. So yeah, I mean,

72
00:03:58.921 --> 00:04:01.470
I don't know if I need to call the cast or something like that.

73
00:04:01.471 --> 00:04:05.250
Let's get daily motion on the phone. Let's uh, let's build this thing, huh?

74
00:04:05.550 --> 00:04:07.800
And look, you might be asking yourself, why would Brian do this?

75
00:04:07.890 --> 00:04:12.090
And I want to submit to you that I think that he actually doesn't believe in

76
00:04:12.091 --> 00:04:16.050
free speech at all. I think he's using it as a convenient tool.

77
00:04:16.290 --> 00:04:20.760
And I'm going to try to prove that to you right now. Okay. Here's evidence one.

78
00:04:21.210 --> 00:04:26.150
Here's him saying that he studies like books about psychopaths and

79
00:04:26.910 --> 00:04:28.950
manipulation and power.

80
00:04:29.070 --> 00:04:33.990
He's going to endorse these two books that really no sane person would think,

81
00:04:34.050 --> 00:04:36.540
Oh, this is a way to model my life here. Listen to this.

82
00:04:36.660 --> 00:04:41.250
<v 2>I read American psycho. I read the book pimp by iceberg slim.</v>

83
00:04:41.490 --> 00:04:42.450
And I saw these.

84
00:04:42.660 --> 00:04:46.380
<v 1>Training manuals. Hey, pimp.</v>

85
00:04:47.280 --> 00:04:50.010
<v 0>American psycho, or about,</v>

86
00:04:50.400 --> 00:04:53.460
Hey spoiler psychos.

87
00:04:55.320 --> 00:04:59.250
That's what they're about. These are books to show the underbelly of society.

88
00:04:59.251 --> 00:05:00.930
Not to show you how to treat people.

89
00:05:01.710 --> 00:05:04.020
If you guys don't know pimped by iceberg slim,

90
00:05:04.170 --> 00:05:08.850
a lot of rappers got inspired by him like ice cube, all these ice teas,

91
00:05:08.880 --> 00:05:13.860
they got inspired by iceberg slim iceberg slim wrote this book called pimp to

92
00:05:13.861 --> 00:05:17.580
basically document his experiences as a pimp and controlling women and

93
00:05:17.581 --> 00:05:18.570
controlling people.

94
00:05:18.870 --> 00:05:22.890
This is the book that Brian Rose says was his training manual. Meanwhile,

95
00:05:22.920 --> 00:05:27.030
iceberg slim. It's not like he doesn't really glorify it.

96
00:05:27.060 --> 00:05:30.180
It's just like an honest account, but he doesn't really glorify it. He's like,

97
00:05:30.181 --> 00:05:33.060
look, I could have been a better person. If I had different upbringing,

98
00:05:33.090 --> 00:05:36.480
a different upbringing. And meanwhile, Brian Rose is like, Hey, great. Some,

99
00:05:36.660 --> 00:05:41.220
some manual on how to control people with manipulation. So I wouldn't put,

100
00:05:41.250 --> 00:05:45.480
put it past Brian to weaponize something like free speech. You know,

101
00:05:45.481 --> 00:05:47.670
he's going to say that he's a big fan. He's not actually,

102
00:05:47.940 --> 00:05:51.960
he's actually a big fan as far as it can serve his devices.

103
00:05:52.290 --> 00:05:54.300
And when his devices are no longer served,

104
00:05:54.301 --> 00:05:57.110
like in the case of us showing a video about him, kind of mocking him,

105
00:05:57.140 --> 00:05:58.460
kind of teasing them a little bit,

106
00:05:58.850 --> 00:06:01.140
that all of a sudden he's going to get super upset about.

107
00:06:01.160 --> 00:06:04.490
And now freedom of speech no longer applies. No freedom of speech for me.

108
00:06:04.610 --> 00:06:08.770
I also want to show you guys this Brian Rose has also been

109
00:06:09.670 --> 00:06:12.070
kind of getting rid of free speech on his own channel.

110
00:06:12.071 --> 00:06:16.090
Even he's been deleting a bunch of content ever since he announced his mayoral

111
00:06:16.091 --> 00:06:18.370
run here. If you look at his social blade,

112
00:06:18.371 --> 00:06:22.180
you can see that he deleted a bunch of videos really recently,

113
00:06:22.450 --> 00:06:25.630
like all within October, look at all those views he lost.

114
00:06:25.630 --> 00:06:28.000
So you might be asking yourself what videos did he delete?

115
00:06:28.001 --> 00:06:30.430
And we don't have a perfect answer for that because YouTube doesn't have a great

116
00:06:30.431 --> 00:06:31.264
way to tell that.

117
00:06:31.450 --> 00:06:35.560
But we do have maybe something to look at because when you delete a video,

118
00:06:35.561 --> 00:06:38.200
that's part of a playlist. It doesn't actually,

119
00:06:38.230 --> 00:06:42.190
it still shows it as like unavailable and you can get into a good idea of what

120
00:06:42.191 --> 00:06:46.990
he deleted by. What's no longer in video playlist. That's how this works.

121
00:06:47.230 --> 00:06:50.620
So I went looking through his playlist and I said, what is Brian Rose hiding?

122
00:06:50.621 --> 00:06:55.450
What's he been deleting lately? And what I've found shocked me,

123
00:06:57.490 --> 00:07:02.140
Brian Rose has been deleting all the conservative podcasts that he had on his

124
00:07:02.141 --> 00:07:06.160
channel. This is Brian. I'll defend your death, your right to say it, whatever.

125
00:07:06.520 --> 00:07:10.540
Look at this. He deleted his Larry elder podcast. Look,

126
00:07:10.780 --> 00:07:15.340
this video has been removed by the uploader. Oops, his Dan Cranshaw episode,

127
00:07:15.730 --> 00:07:19.180
his Dennis Prager episode, Candace Owens,

128
00:07:19.181 --> 00:07:21.190
but it's got a certain leaning to it, right?

129
00:07:21.191 --> 00:07:24.730
Because he's got other interviews that you might think of as maybe a little bit

130
00:07:24.731 --> 00:07:26.200
controversial, uh,

131
00:07:26.230 --> 00:07:29.830
that are still up as long as they have left-wing views.

132
00:07:30.010 --> 00:07:33.100
But if they're a right winger, then all of a sudden he removes them. Dave Ruby,

133
00:07:33.580 --> 00:07:35.440
Ben's removed. Here we go. Dave Rubin.

134
00:07:35.650 --> 00:07:39.310
But basically he's cleaning house of all the controversial interviews.

135
00:07:39.340 --> 00:07:43.510
He's censoring himself and removing stuff off of his platform.

136
00:07:43.511 --> 00:07:44.800
So people can't find it any more.

137
00:07:44.801 --> 00:07:47.290
Find out what he believes now that he's running for mayor.

138
00:07:47.650 --> 00:07:51.400
Look even David Ike, Mr. David Ike,

139
00:07:51.401 --> 00:07:54.490
the guy who basically put Brian on the map, to be honest,

140
00:07:55.630 --> 00:07:57.460
Brian's career exploded.

141
00:07:57.461 --> 00:08:00.450
When he got connected with David I where all the videos that David,

142
00:08:00.570 --> 00:08:04.780
there are 16, no 15 deleted did videos with David Ike.

143
00:08:05.230 --> 00:08:09.460
And the one that is still on what it's called is I,

144
00:08:09.680 --> 00:08:12.490
I don't agree with everything you say, but I'll defend to the death,

145
00:08:12.491 --> 00:08:16.420
your right to say it. Apparently only until it's politically inconvenient forum.

146
00:08:16.421 --> 00:08:18.130
And then he'll delete your video with him.

147
00:08:18.460 --> 00:08:22.510
I will say he still has his videos up on the digital freedom platform.

148
00:08:22.540 --> 00:08:26.110
I will give you that. But I think there's some very strategic reasons.

149
00:08:26.111 --> 00:08:28.420
He's removing them from YouTube and I'm going to prove it a second.

150
00:08:28.421 --> 00:08:30.160
That it's him removing them, not YouTube.

151
00:08:30.580 --> 00:08:35.170
I think he's doing it because he knows most people won't actually go through

152
00:08:35.470 --> 00:08:37.030
the, his platform.

153
00:08:37.330 --> 00:08:39.490
They're going to go through YouTube to find out what he thinks.

154
00:08:40.000 --> 00:08:44.560
So he's curating is very powerful public image.

155
00:08:44.561 --> 00:08:47.560
He knows he's in the public eye now that he's trying to run for mayor.

156
00:08:47.561 --> 00:08:48.670
And so he's trying to clean out.

157
00:08:48.720 --> 00:08:52.420
He doesn't want to be seen associating with somebody like David Ike,

158
00:08:52.630 --> 00:08:54.730
because he knows he's going to be seen as a conspiracy.

159
00:08:54.731 --> 00:08:58.710
Theorist knows the optics of it. He might say that he's Mr. Free speech.

160
00:08:58.711 --> 00:09:00.930
I'll let David icon my platform. But in reality,

161
00:09:00.931 --> 00:09:04.830
he's trying to distance himself. I don't know David. I know David IQ,

162
00:09:04.860 --> 00:09:08.280
that kind of stuff. Because when you look at these videos that he's deleted,

163
00:09:08.281 --> 00:09:11.490
right? You got to look at these videos that he's deleted. Look,

164
00:09:11.670 --> 00:09:15.180
you might be thinking yourself. Well, surely YouTube has deleted all of them,

165
00:09:15.181 --> 00:09:17.850
right? Well, no, cause he's always crying censorship, right?

166
00:09:17.880 --> 00:09:20.580
And it's not true that YouTube deleted all of them. Look,

167
00:09:20.640 --> 00:09:24.000
this is a private video, a private, anything that says private automatically,

168
00:09:24.001 --> 00:09:28.710
you know, that Lennon real proactively did that. Then secondly, you can tell,

169
00:09:28.711 --> 00:09:32.760
even with deleted videos, whether London real deleted it or YouTube deleted it,

170
00:09:33.000 --> 00:09:33.541
for example,

171
00:09:33.541 --> 00:09:36.690
there's one video in this playlist that was actually deleted by YouTube.

172
00:09:36.720 --> 00:09:37.620
It's this one right here.

173
00:09:37.950 --> 00:09:41.400
It says this video has been removed for violating YouTube community guidelines,

174
00:09:41.700 --> 00:09:44.370
but the rest of them, the rest of these deleted videos,

175
00:09:44.371 --> 00:09:47.070
they say this video has been removed by the uploader.

176
00:09:47.071 --> 00:09:51.100
Can you see that this video has been removed by here's another one he's done.

177
00:09:51.180 --> 00:09:54.300
This video has been removed by the uploader. Here's another one once again,

178
00:09:54.301 --> 00:09:58.530
removed, but does this all mean London real is cleaning house with all of his,

179
00:09:58.920 --> 00:10:01.620
uh, controversial episodes. You know, I don't, by the way,

180
00:10:01.621 --> 00:10:06.390
I don't care if you're conservative, uh, Republican Democrat, liberal, what,

181
00:10:06.391 --> 00:10:09.060
however you identify, that's not the point of this channel,

182
00:10:09.120 --> 00:10:11.490
not a political thing. It's a hypocrisy thing.

183
00:10:11.730 --> 00:10:16.650
You can't be Mr. Free speech and then not actually support free

184
00:10:16.651 --> 00:10:17.550
speech on your channel.

185
00:10:17.630 --> 00:10:21.680
<v 1>One thing I've understood about freedom of speech is it really means freedom of</v>

186
00:10:21.681 --> 00:10:24.800
speech for things you don't want to hear out of other people's minds.

187
00:10:26.840 --> 00:10:30.320
<v 0>Anyway, that's basically it. I just want to give a quick shout out by the way,</v>

188
00:10:30.560 --> 00:10:33.860
for the guy who designed this, this set that you're seeing right now,

189
00:10:33.890 --> 00:10:37.100

190
00:10:37.760 --> 00:10:39.290
