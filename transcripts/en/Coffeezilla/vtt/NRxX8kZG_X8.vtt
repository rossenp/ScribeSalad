<v 0>[Inaudible].</v>

2
00:00:05.660 --> 00:00:08.600
<v 1>Just when you thought 20, 20 couldn't get any crazier.</v>

3
00:00:08.960 --> 00:00:12.050
Y'all are out here trying to recreate the movies. Baby,

4
00:00:12.410 --> 00:00:17.240
a Ponti scheme suspect used an underwater scooter to try to

5
00:00:17.241 --> 00:00:20.870
flee from the FBI. Unsuccessfully it's too much.

6
00:00:20.900 --> 00:00:25.520
If you are trying to fleet the FBI with a C scooter, it's time to reevaluate.

7
00:00:25.521 --> 00:00:29.090
If you find yourself at the bottom of the ocean Scootin, Hey,

8
00:00:29.900 --> 00:00:33.620
you've made a series of life choices that led you to that point.

9
00:00:33.800 --> 00:00:38.000
This man named Matthew Pearcey was underwater for

10
00:00:38.001 --> 00:00:42.560
25 minutes, trying to scoot around with his little sea scooter.

11
00:00:42.561 --> 00:00:46.340
He goes like four miles an hour and the detectives are on land.

12
00:00:46.341 --> 00:00:49.700
Just like watching him. And he's down there thinking to himself, dude,

13
00:00:50.150 --> 00:00:53.900
I'm getting away with it. He saw national treasure one time, right?

14
00:00:53.930 --> 00:00:55.640
Y'all remember the national treasure scene.

15
00:00:55.790 --> 00:00:58.820
This is a scene where Nicholas cage has being chased by the FBI.

16
00:00:59.030 --> 00:01:03.200
And he escapes by jumping into the river and escaping on a sea scooter.

17
00:01:03.380 --> 00:01:05.060
This guy thinks to himself, Hey,

18
00:01:07.550 --> 00:01:11.060
if cage can do it, I could do it. Listen guys, I'm just telling you the dudes.

19
00:01:11.061 --> 00:01:14.540
These are the facts. This really happened. So he's scooting around,

20
00:01:14.630 --> 00:01:17.480
but he what he doesn't realize and what national treasure doesn't show you.

21
00:01:17.630 --> 00:01:22.100
Cause the movies aren't real is guess what comes up when you're underwater

22
00:01:23.030 --> 00:01:24.740
Scootin, baubles,

23
00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:28.880
the DOJ says that Pearcey spent time underwater submerged,

24
00:01:28.881 --> 00:01:32.480
where all the detectives and the FBI could do is see the bubbles.

25
00:01:33.140 --> 00:01:35.240
But the thing is they could see the bubbles. So this guy,

26
00:01:35.420 --> 00:01:37.940
this guy's scooting around at four miles an hour at the,

27
00:01:38.150 --> 00:01:42.650
at the Lake depths Lake Shasta, it's freezing by the way at Lake Shasta,

28
00:01:42.770 --> 00:01:44.930
they thought he had hypothermia afterwards. He didn't,

29
00:01:45.320 --> 00:01:48.350
but he thinks he's getting away with it and turns out they're just like walking

30
00:01:48.351 --> 00:01:49.310
alongside as you skewed.

31
00:01:49.390 --> 00:01:52.040
And you could probably walk that fast four miles an hour. It's nothing.

32
00:01:52.160 --> 00:01:54.530
So he gets caught. He's going to jail.

33
00:01:54.650 --> 00:01:57.500
And now they're saying he's a flight risk, of course,

34
00:01:57.740 --> 00:02:01.550
because he's trying to escape an underwater submersibles and it looks like he

35
00:02:01.551 --> 00:02:02.990
might get life in prison.

36
00:02:02.991 --> 00:02:06.860
He's facing several counts to potentially 20 year long sentences.

37
00:02:06.861 --> 00:02:09.620
So it does look like he will be going to jail for a very long time.

38
00:02:09.621 --> 00:02:13.640
And I say two things. First of all, good show the scammers.

39
00:02:13.641 --> 00:02:15.290
What you get when you run ponds, these games,

40
00:02:15.500 --> 00:02:17.900
number two to the future prison warden,

41
00:02:18.020 --> 00:02:19.730
make sure you don't give this guy a rock hammer.

42
00:02:20.900 --> 00:02:23.960
We know that this is a man with some ideas he might, uh,

43
00:02:24.260 --> 00:02:27.020
get to Shawshank in his way out of there. We don't know,

44
00:02:27.860 --> 00:02:31.130
but this just goes to show boys crime pays temporarily look.

45
00:02:31.131 --> 00:02:34.100
He was banking $35 million Ponzi scheme,

46
00:02:34.460 --> 00:02:36.110
but eventually you're going to get caught.

47
00:02:36.140 --> 00:02:38.660
You're going to look like a full we're going to call you out for it.

48
00:02:38.960 --> 00:02:42.020
His Ponzi scheme was all built on the idea of algorithmic trading,

49
00:02:42.021 --> 00:02:44.840
but there's only one algorithm going on. You gave him money.

50
00:02:45.140 --> 00:02:49.010
You lost money because he spent it on houseboats house renovations,

51
00:02:49.011 --> 00:02:52.850
all this stuff, total scumbag. And it looks like he's getting what he deserves.

52
00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:54.500
Next time you think your day's bad.

53
00:02:54.680 --> 00:02:59.000
Just imagine freezing your butt off in Lake Shasta, trying to evade the FBI,

54
00:02:59.140 --> 00:02:59.973
a C scooter.

55
00:03:01.360 --> 00:03:03.430
<v 2>Anyway, let's do that. See you next time.</v>

56
00:03:04.170 --> 00:03:08.640
