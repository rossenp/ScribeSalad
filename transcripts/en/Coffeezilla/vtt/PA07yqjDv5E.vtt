00:00:00.300 --> 00:00:03.210
<v 0>Amazon is raising its minimum wage to $15.</v>

2
00:00:03.210 --> 00:00:07.890
<v 1>An hour. What's that? Amazon just what? $15 an hour,</v>

3
00:00:07.980 --> 00:00:09.180
$15 an hour,

4
00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:13.500
$15 an hour.

5
00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:31.170
$15. Hi.

6
00:00:32.780 --> 00:00:36.230
<v 0>This is what you might call a get rich quick scammer. That is, uh,</v>

7
00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:41.150
they like to mock people with nine to five jobs and tell you that you should go

8
00:00:41.151 --> 00:00:41.990
tell your boss.

9
00:00:42.980 --> 00:00:43.813
<v 1>Off.</v>

10
00:00:44.210 --> 00:00:45.470
<v 0>And that's basically it.</v>

11
00:00:45.650 --> 00:00:49.760
We're going to walk through his sales pitch and get to know more about our

12
00:00:49.790 --> 00:00:51.520
little friend here. So.

13
00:00:51.890 --> 00:00:53.390
<v 1>So stick around.</v>

14
00:00:53.720 --> 00:00:57.740
<v 0>What up guys do you want to easily ditch your nine to five and make six figures</v>

15
00:00:57.741 --> 00:01:02.270
a year working only one day a week from your laptop? I know.

16
00:01:02.271 --> 00:01:05.300
I sure do. Who is this mysterious man?

17
00:01:05.630 --> 00:01:09.800
Who's laughing at the idea of a nine to five job, right?

18
00:01:10.040 --> 00:01:12.020
Because everyone who works nine to five jobs, they're losers,

19
00:01:13.400 --> 00:01:16.790
losers work for a living. Are you kidding me?

20
00:01:17.930 --> 00:01:21.500
Adrian G is his name and unbelievably dope.

21
00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:24.290
That's a lot of subscribers. Okay. This guy is popular.

22
00:01:24.291 --> 00:01:28.520
It seems like all the popular people are hopping on selling, get rich products,

23
00:01:28.521 --> 00:01:32.630
right? They love it. They love selling to their gullible fans.

24
00:01:33.080 --> 00:01:37.190
They're little fantasies. So he's selling something called six figure Sunday.

25
00:01:37.430 --> 00:01:40.610
I guess that's the day you're supposed to work one day a week to make six

26
00:01:40.611 --> 00:01:43.520
figures. Now, if that doesn't already sound preposterous. I mean,

27
00:01:43.580 --> 00:01:46.220
I know it already does. So hold on though. Hold on. Don't click up.

28
00:01:46.610 --> 00:01:50.030
I know it sounds preposterous, but you won't believe what this guy said.

29
00:01:50.210 --> 00:01:54.170
You'll be wondering why haven't the police knocked on this guy's door.

30
00:01:55.580 --> 00:01:56.390
Seriously.

31
00:01:56.390 --> 00:02:01.280
It's unbelievable what this guy tries to hoodwink people with and the fact that

32
00:02:01.281 --> 00:02:04.310
no one's caught him out on it is honestly insane.

33
00:02:04.311 --> 00:02:09.080
1.79 million subscribers and he's Hocking this crazy stuff.

34
00:02:09.590 --> 00:02:12.950
So let's get into what he's promising, what he's guaranteeing.

35
00:02:13.010 --> 00:02:16.610
So we've already gone through him, mocking people who work for a living,

36
00:02:16.611 --> 00:02:18.020
but let's see that again, real quick.

37
00:02:18.620 --> 00:02:19.820
<v 1>$15 An hour,</v>

38
00:02:21.410 --> 00:02:24.110
$15 an hour.

39
00:02:28.490 --> 00:02:29.720
<v 0>You work for a living,</v>

40
00:02:29.780 --> 00:02:33.740
but later he tries to redeem himself because he basically insults you right out.

41
00:02:33.741 --> 00:02:35.210
The gate tries to redeem himself.

42
00:02:36.260 --> 00:02:40.700
<v 1>Well worth $100, $200, three, $500 an hour.</v>

43
00:02:41.330 --> 00:02:43.310
<v 0>Okay? So this is a smart play. Basically. He's like, look,</v>

44
00:02:43.311 --> 00:02:47.270
if you're not making 500 bucks an hour, like you're worth it. You're worth it,

45
00:02:47.280 --> 00:02:50.750
boss, babe, go get what you're worth. He's saying that it's on you.

46
00:02:50.751 --> 00:02:53.600
If you're not making that kind of money, maybe you you're missing the secret.

47
00:02:53.960 --> 00:02:58.520
<v 1>Great. And I'm going to show you exactly how to achieve that today.</v>

48
00:02:58.700 --> 00:03:03.160
I am going to show you how to make six figures working from the

49
00:03:03.340 --> 00:03:04.240
beach.

50
00:03:04.480 --> 00:03:09.190
But before I show you how to make six figures a year by working just one day a

51
00:03:09.191 --> 00:03:14.050
week from your laptop. Let me tell you a little about who the hell I am.

52
00:03:14.850 --> 00:03:18.060
<v 0>Are you kidding, dude? Who in the hell I am.</v>

53
00:03:18.510 --> 00:03:23.280
Nobody cares who the hell you are. Why is he looking so intensely at the camera?

54
00:03:23.940 --> 00:03:24.930
And he's got that like open,

55
00:03:28.410 --> 00:03:32.400
close it piped out. Nobody cares who you are. Okay? You may have 1.7,

56
00:03:32.401 --> 00:03:36.720
9 million subscribers. So technically people already know who the hell you are,

57
00:03:36.721 --> 00:03:40.890
but we don't care. The copy's Zillow army. We don't respect people like you.

58
00:03:41.130 --> 00:03:41.963
My name.

59
00:03:42.210 --> 00:03:44.790
<v 1>Is Adrian. Grish gone. But for short,</v>

60
00:03:44.791 --> 00:03:49.440
you can simply call me Adrian G and over the past five years

61
00:03:49.620 --> 00:03:53.070
of work, nothing. But one day a week,

62
00:03:53.430 --> 00:03:54.870
I worked a nine to five,

63
00:03:54.900 --> 00:03:59.250
just like you and you and you

64
00:04:00.450 --> 00:04:01.890
and you. I.

65
00:04:02.550 --> 00:04:05.400
<v 0>The contingent in his face when he's doing this, he's like, Hey,</v>

66
00:04:05.401 --> 00:04:09.780
I used to be a loser. Like you guys, you, you tax support,

67
00:04:09.810 --> 00:04:11.310
loser guide.

68
00:04:11.380 --> 00:04:15.870
You can't see this guy driving a bus loser guy doing construction work loser.

69
00:04:15.871 --> 00:04:19.350
Have you thought about selling? [inaudible] get rich guys Gibbs.

70
00:04:19.740 --> 00:04:22.170
That that is just something I can't stand in this industry.

71
00:04:22.171 --> 00:04:26.700
I'll let this play more in a second. But the belittling of actual work,

72
00:04:26.940 --> 00:04:31.290
while you sit around here and promise empty dreams to people is so

73
00:04:31.291 --> 00:04:32.730
disgusting, dude,

74
00:04:33.150 --> 00:04:37.440
I am sickened by this I'm sickened by this

75
00:04:37.441 --> 00:04:39.510
belittling of real jobs, dude.

76
00:04:39.600 --> 00:04:44.550
It's one of the things that drives me most crazy about this disgusting world of

77
00:04:44.700 --> 00:04:46.620
get rich, quick scheme. It's icky.

78
00:04:47.220 --> 00:04:51.960
<v 1>Years and years of what I politely defined as hell one day, sir.</v>

79
00:04:52.590 --> 00:04:55.140
<v 0>So he wasn't, he wasn't belittling it it's hell.</v>

80
00:04:55.620 --> 00:04:58.770
<v 1>Everything just clicked. I snapped and finally had enough.</v>

81
00:04:59.130 --> 00:05:00.060
<v 0>So for the sake of time,</v>

82
00:05:00.061 --> 00:05:02.970
I'm going to skip ahead here a little bit and say that he gives you the whole

83
00:05:02.971 --> 00:05:04.590
sob story, right? He goes,

84
00:05:04.591 --> 00:05:09.480
he says that he used to work nine to five jobs just like ear and yeah.

85
00:05:10.020 --> 00:05:14.370
And yeah, Eddie. Yeah. Right. He did that whole sub story. He says,

86
00:05:14.371 --> 00:05:18.780
my boss, he fired me it's he was such a jerk, whatever.

87
00:05:18.781 --> 00:05:22.560
Then I basically found the secret, right? He's going to talk about,

88
00:05:22.561 --> 00:05:26.430
he was destitute. He was, he was about to be homeless. He said, and uh,

89
00:05:26.580 --> 00:05:30.600
one day he was trying to figure out what is he good at our guys.

90
00:05:30.601 --> 00:05:33.290
Finally gonna tell us what the secret is. What's his skill? What, what,

91
00:05:33.300 --> 00:05:34.560
what was his big epiphany?

92
00:05:35.880 --> 00:05:37.200
<v 1>I had to be something.</v>

93
00:05:37.230 --> 00:05:41.490
I was good at something where I could give value to the world that I was

94
00:05:41.491 --> 00:05:42.990
actually passionate about.

95
00:05:44.400 --> 00:05:47.940
And that's when I received a text message from one of my lady, friends,

96
00:05:48.420 --> 00:05:52.200
Amber that said, Hey, babe, what you up to buckle up boys?

97
00:05:52.230 --> 00:05:55.260
And that's when I had my money-making epiphany.

98
00:05:56.130 --> 00:06:00.050
<v 0>This is what he's about. He's very passionate about Amber trust.</v>

99
00:06:00.310 --> 00:06:02.920
<v 1>You see, Amber was a girl I met at the grocery store,</v>

100
00:06:03.100 --> 00:06:07.120
got her number and it happened having some fun with her ever since.

101
00:06:07.270 --> 00:06:10.030
And she was just one of many, many girls on my roster.

102
00:06:10.480 --> 00:06:12.250
All my guy friends would always ask me,

103
00:06:12.910 --> 00:06:16.540
how the hell do you pull so many girls so easily?

104
00:06:17.350 --> 00:06:21.340
I would simply smile, shrug my shoulders and say, I have no idea.

105
00:06:21.341 --> 00:06:22.570
I just sort of do my thing.

106
00:06:27.610 --> 00:06:27.990
<v 2>Imagine.</v>

107
00:06:27.990 --> 00:06:31.270
<v 0>Think about yourself and be like, all my guy, friends are like dead.</v>

108
00:06:32.050 --> 00:06:36.760
How you slay so much dead? How did he get so many girls? And I'm just like,

109
00:06:37.060 --> 00:06:38.890
Ugh, I dunno. It's just sort of something I do.

110
00:06:39.640 --> 00:06:44.290
<v 1>But this is when I realized that I do have a skill</v>

111
00:06:44.680 --> 00:06:48.190
and not just a skill, but a skill that would be valuable to other people,

112
00:06:48.191 --> 00:06:49.210
which is the key.

113
00:06:50.020 --> 00:06:54.970
So while I could never go to school to be a dentist or a surgeon per

114
00:06:54.971 --> 00:06:58.600
se, I guess you could just call me the love doctor.

115
00:07:03.310 --> 00:07:04.870
<v 2>The love doctor.</v>

116
00:07:10.630 --> 00:07:13.480
<v 0>I swear guys. Sometimes I really do think to myself,</v>

117
00:07:13.780 --> 00:07:15.880
why isn't everybody in the world talking to me?

118
00:07:16.270 --> 00:07:18.250
<v 2>Where's puny pie, dude.</v>

119
00:07:18.520 --> 00:07:21.850
This is the love doctor.

120
00:07:22.090 --> 00:07:25.420
<v 0>I swear when you guys say copies of what's happened to which one you're actually</v>

121
00:07:25.421 --> 00:07:29.980
right. It's criminal. How much fun that I'm having. But anyways, love doctor,

122
00:07:29.981 --> 00:07:33.040
guys practicing without a license doctor.

123
00:07:33.400 --> 00:07:37.270
<v 1>Because I was as good at picking up chicks as any man walking earth.</v>

124
00:07:38.230 --> 00:07:39.280
But the thing is,

125
00:07:39.550 --> 00:07:43.660
while I had all the knowledge and secrets in the world on how to help guys pick

126
00:07:43.661 --> 00:07:44.494
up women,

127
00:07:45.040 --> 00:07:49.840
there was still no way I could create my own product and package it within two

128
00:07:49.841 --> 00:07:53.290
weeks before I was out of my office from this eviction notice.

129
00:07:53.560 --> 00:07:56.050
<v 0>Oh yeah. Sorry guys. Uh, I, we got to skip past this.</v>

130
00:07:56.110 --> 00:08:00.340
It's just like the boring sob story about how he was just like, yeah.

131
00:08:00.550 --> 00:08:03.850
He's about to be evicted from his apartment. That's to get your emotions all,

132
00:08:03.851 --> 00:08:08.110
you know, stirred up. Oh, magically. He figured it out. He mastered it.

133
00:08:08.350 --> 00:08:12.340
And that's his way of trying to get you to follow him.

134
00:08:12.370 --> 00:08:13.990
It's because you think to yourself, Oh,

135
00:08:14.050 --> 00:08:17.710
I was just like this guy I'm in a bad spot. Maybe he's holds the secret.

136
00:08:17.711 --> 00:08:21.280
It's a classic copywriting tool. Okay. So now he's going to get into the pitch.

137
00:08:21.281 --> 00:08:22.900
He's going to start selling, selling, selling,

138
00:08:22.901 --> 00:08:25.090
and this is where it gets truly disgusting.

139
00:08:26.110 --> 00:08:26.740
<v 1>Full, detailed,</v>

140
00:08:26.740 --> 00:08:31.420
easy to use program ever created on how to generate a six figure revenue working

141
00:08:31.421 --> 00:08:34.390
just one day a week, guaranteed.

142
00:08:34.540 --> 00:08:37.330
This isn't a program filled with cheesy. Get rich,

143
00:08:37.360 --> 00:08:38.740
quick schemes for you to follow.

144
00:08:47.020 --> 00:08:48.850
<v 2>Oh my gosh.</v>

145
00:08:50.430 --> 00:08:54.340
<v 0>People say that with a straight face without, without doing this,</v>

146
00:08:59.220 --> 00:09:02.970
your program is literally called six-figure Sunday.

147
00:09:03.000 --> 00:09:06.840
In which you teach people to make six figures working one day a week.

148
00:09:06.900 --> 00:09:11.850
If that's not a get rich quick program. I don't, I don't know what is, I mean,

149
00:09:11.851 --> 00:09:16.140
look, you're the love doctor, right? I'm copies Zillow. You're the love doctor.

150
00:09:16.170 --> 00:09:19.470
I'm copies though. I specialize in get rich, quick schemes. I'm sorry to say,

151
00:09:19.471 --> 00:09:22.110
buddy. We've uh, done the math.

152
00:09:24.120 --> 00:09:27.480
It's a get rich quick scheme. I mean, that's what it is. So anyway,

153
00:09:27.481 --> 00:09:30.900
now he's going to talk about, uh, how bosses are evil again. Right?

154
00:09:31.140 --> 00:09:32.070
Cause he really needs to sell you.

155
00:09:32.710 --> 00:09:37.460
<v 1>Well, I got five. I almost get evicted and ended up homeless.</v>

156
00:09:37.670 --> 00:09:41.420
Honestly. Now that I look back on it,

157
00:09:42.470 --> 00:09:47.360
living like that and letting another man have so much power over me actually

158
00:09:47.361 --> 00:09:51.890
made me less of a man. It's just something I have to admit this.

159
00:09:52.220 --> 00:09:53.720
<v 0>It's such a scumbag dude.</v>

160
00:09:54.110 --> 00:09:57.290
Why he's doing this is because he's telling you at home. Hey,

161
00:09:57.920 --> 00:10:02.270
if you have a boss, you really kind of, you kind of a baby boy, are you a baby?

162
00:10:03.020 --> 00:10:04.580
If you don't have my program, you're a baby boy.

163
00:10:05.030 --> 00:10:08.030
Because if you let her have a boss have that kind of power over you, dude,

164
00:10:08.600 --> 00:10:12.800
doesn't that make you less of a man? I don't know.

165
00:10:12.801 --> 00:10:15.830
There's this sky. So shameless.

166
00:10:16.310 --> 00:10:21.170
<v 1>Wait, if I'm being real with myself and besides my boss being the</v>

167
00:10:21.171 --> 00:10:25.160
world's biggest going into work five days a week,

168
00:10:25.161 --> 00:10:29.390
just to make enough money to live. Wasn't too fun in its own, right?

169
00:10:30.140 --> 00:10:34.400
Just an outright dead end job with no extra time or money for leisure.

170
00:10:34.430 --> 00:10:39.230
While all the CEO does is kickback on his luxury yacht sipping

171
00:10:40.340 --> 00:10:45.230
$5,000 bottles of champagne off of my blood, sweat and tears.

172
00:10:46.640 --> 00:10:50.330
<v 0>Again, this guy is so out to lunch. Did,</v>

173
00:10:50.480 --> 00:10:52.070
that's why I'm going to call BS on him,

174
00:10:52.071 --> 00:10:56.090
probably ever having a job who thinks their boss is doing this dude.

175
00:10:56.150 --> 00:10:59.780
Most CEOs are working their tail off. I mean,

176
00:10:59.781 --> 00:11:03.650
I know it's a meme that they sit back with, like their fat cats and yeah,

177
00:11:03.680 --> 00:11:07.310
they get paid a lot, but they're not sitting on yachts all day.

178
00:11:07.311 --> 00:11:10.190
Sipping $5,000 bottles of champagne.

179
00:11:10.460 --> 00:11:15.380
This is such a cringe overdone trope that these people try to

180
00:11:15.381 --> 00:11:19.850
do. Oh, your boss is just, he's just sitting on the yacht, doing nothing.

181
00:11:19.880 --> 00:11:22.700
Why is he even there when you're, you're doing everything,

182
00:11:23.060 --> 00:11:25.100
it's such a dumb view of how jobs work.

183
00:11:25.760 --> 00:11:27.650
<v 1>And I want to reiterate again.</v>

184
00:11:28.460 --> 00:11:33.350
I'm sure you've seen other make money programs out there claiming to help you

185
00:11:33.351 --> 00:11:38.120
make $100 million or make 50 K in just seven days.

186
00:11:38.750 --> 00:11:40.520
But this is the difference.

187
00:11:41.330 --> 00:11:46.100
I'm not here to give you false BS expectations. And so your dreams,

188
00:11:46.730 --> 00:11:50.060
Nope, I can't help you make 50 K in only seven days. And no,

189
00:11:50.061 --> 00:11:52.880
I don't guarantee you be able to make 100 million.

190
00:11:54.160 --> 00:11:58.600
But what I can promise is you will be able to make six figures a year

191
00:11:58.960 --> 00:12:00.520
working just one day a week,

192
00:12:00.970 --> 00:12:04.240
which is more than what most humans could ever ask for.

193
00:12:04.900 --> 00:12:08.800
If you're looking to be the next bill Gates or Jeff bays.

194
00:12:09.000 --> 00:12:12.240
<v 2>Oh you can't shut up. Shut, shut your mouth. When I'm talking,</v>

195
00:12:13.840 --> 00:12:18.090
Hey, you can't, you can't do that. That's illegal.

196
00:12:18.900 --> 00:12:21.510
It should, it should be illegal. Right?

197
00:12:21.540 --> 00:12:25.230
That that's illegal to do what you just did. Hey,

198
00:12:26.520 --> 00:12:31.140
I'm not, I'm not here to promise you get rich quick schemes. Right? Hey. Um,

199
00:12:31.320 --> 00:12:34.950
but I w what I can promise you is that you can work one day a week and make six

200
00:12:34.951 --> 00:12:39.390
figures. This isn't some kind of crazy get rich, quick scheme. Am I right guys?

201
00:12:42.150 --> 00:12:42.983
This guy?

202
00:12:48.510 --> 00:12:49.380
Oh my God.

203
00:12:54.690 --> 00:12:57.240
I've lost it, dude. I've lost the pot. Okay. Let's get,

204
00:12:57.660 --> 00:12:58.650
let's get back into this.

205
00:12:59.190 --> 00:13:02.490
<v 1>Be honest in this economy.</v>

206
00:13:03.900 --> 00:13:06.420
<v 2>Oh, I actually, I actually know what part is coming up. Oh,</v>

207
00:13:06.421 --> 00:13:07.740
you guys are going to love this,

208
00:13:11.240 --> 00:13:15.120
this baby by the greatest, get rich, quick scheme video of all time.

209
00:13:15.600 --> 00:13:18.240
Can we get some light in here? It's kind of bothering me. Hold on one second.

210
00:13:18.870 --> 00:13:20.820
Go ahead. Sorry. Sorry to interrupt. You.

211
00:13:20.910 --> 00:13:24.630
<v 1>Originally planned to give this system away from absolutely free.</v>

212
00:13:24.690 --> 00:13:28.350
That is until I realized such a move would turn out to be

213
00:13:29.770 --> 00:13:30.603
counterproductive. Yeah.

214
00:13:34.410 --> 00:13:36.720
<v 2>Really? You plan to give it away for free.</v>

215
00:13:40.440 --> 00:13:44.820
I wanted to give it away for free, but it'd be Ghana. I have to charge you guys.

216
00:13:44.910 --> 00:13:47.880
<v 1>And ruin the mission of what I actually set out to do,</v>

217
00:13:48.510 --> 00:13:52.080
which is helping you make six figures on your own.

218
00:13:52.860 --> 00:13:55.440
Let me explain you.

219
00:13:55.441 --> 00:14:00.000
See if everyone were to download this system for free the

220
00:14:00.001 --> 00:14:03.480
system and skills that teachers would go viral instantly.

221
00:14:04.620 --> 00:14:08.490
Why is this a bad thing? Because once it goes viral,

222
00:14:08.940 --> 00:14:13.920
all the other blogs will steal my powerful secrets and rebrand as a

223
00:14:13.921 --> 00:14:15.240
get rich, quick scheme.

224
00:14:16.500 --> 00:14:20.160
<v 2>Get rich, quick scheme. I want to tell you it is fun.</v>

225
00:14:21.390 --> 00:14:23.880
Remember, I'm the get rich quick scheme doctor.

226
00:14:24.570 --> 00:14:29.190
<v 1>And that's when all the lazy poses will attempt to use the system while you the</v>

227
00:14:29.191 --> 00:14:33.660
serious one will pass over it because you think it's just not a

228
00:14:33.680 --> 00:14:37.350
BS system. Like all the other crap floating around out there.

229
00:14:37.750 --> 00:14:42.180
<v 2>This is such a pathetic attempt to hide the real reason he just wants to make</v>

230
00:14:42.181 --> 00:14:46.650
money. Hey, that's the reason he's not some altruist.

231
00:14:47.220 --> 00:14:48.990
He's not trying to give you secret powerful,

232
00:14:48.991 --> 00:14:52.430
magical formulas out of the kindness of his. So.

233
00:14:52.820 --> 00:14:54.980
<v 1>Off to some careful deliberation,</v>

234
00:14:54.981 --> 00:14:59.480
I was able to pull some strings and strike the perfect balance on the cost of

235
00:14:59.600 --> 00:15:01.610
the system to ensure I was there.

236
00:15:01.960 --> 00:15:04.000
<v 0>Really put, Hey, I'm out there fighting for you.</v>

237
00:15:04.001 --> 00:15:07.210
I told the people above me who made the course me.

238
00:15:07.630 --> 00:15:10.120
I told them you can't charge them this much. I swear, dude,

239
00:15:10.121 --> 00:15:13.030
it's unethical to charge them this much. They're broke. They need help.

240
00:15:13.300 --> 00:15:14.650
But at the same time, we have to charge them.

241
00:15:14.770 --> 00:15:17.890
Cause otherwise it would be it'd be go viral instantly. We wouldn't want that.

242
00:15:18.190 --> 00:15:20.140
So I told myself, you better give them a good price.

243
00:15:21.160 --> 00:15:25.990
<v 1>Every person in need of ditching that boss and making six figures a year</v>

244
00:15:25.991 --> 00:15:29.590
could easily afford it. So today,

245
00:15:30.700 --> 00:15:32.020
for a limited time,

246
00:15:32.530 --> 00:15:37.240
you can access the six figure Sunday system instantly for a one-time

247
00:15:37.241 --> 00:15:40.360
fee of just $497,

248
00:15:40.690 --> 00:15:45.310
which is 78% off the normal price of $2,197.

249
00:15:45.460 --> 00:15:49.240
And once you get your hands on the six biggest Sunday system,

250
00:15:50.020 --> 00:15:54.490
it's going to be like sticking the key in the ignition of a brand new land

251
00:15:54.491 --> 00:15:55.324
became.

252
00:15:57.100 --> 00:15:59.770
<v 0>Guys, don't worry. Don't forget. This is not a get rich quick scheme.</v>

253
00:16:00.430 --> 00:16:02.140
It's not once you get it.

254
00:16:02.141 --> 00:16:05.350
It is like sticking the keys in the ignition of a brand new Lamborghini.

255
00:16:05.380 --> 00:16:10.360
But remember guys, this isn't like the other crap floating around out there.

256
00:16:10.361 --> 00:16:14.230
In fact, that's why he has to charge you $497 for it truthfully.

257
00:16:17.830 --> 00:16:20.800
And that's that's the end.

258
00:16:20.801 --> 00:16:24.790
He goes and sits down at his desk while wearing board shorts,

259
00:16:24.791 --> 00:16:28.840
I guess to show that, Oh wow, this guy is such a rock star dead.

260
00:16:29.560 --> 00:16:32.710
He doesn't even wear pants. I mean, honestly, I'm not impressed.

261
00:16:32.740 --> 00:16:37.300
That used to be original before COVID now. I mean, it's original to wear pants,

262
00:16:37.510 --> 00:16:41.230
right? Like now I'm the original one actually out here wearing pants.

263
00:16:43.480 --> 00:16:46.750
Oh, and then get this and you start counting money. Gosh, that's so loud.

264
00:16:47.140 --> 00:16:47.973
So aggressive.

265
00:16:53.290 --> 00:16:55.090
So one last thing I want to talk about before we go, like,

266
00:16:55.091 --> 00:16:59.470
I know you already think he's a scumbag, but look, one thing he harps on.

267
00:16:59.471 --> 00:17:01.540
One thing he makes painfully clear is, Oh my gosh,

268
00:17:01.570 --> 00:17:05.140
I'm such a good guy for offering you a guarantee. And by that he means the,

269
00:17:05.380 --> 00:17:06.490
as a money back guarantee,

270
00:17:06.550 --> 00:17:10.750
which most people in the get rich space have actually how this works.

271
00:17:10.751 --> 00:17:14.440
The little insider secret is they have a calculation for Eve.

272
00:17:14.470 --> 00:17:17.560
They know almost nobody. This is going to happen for nobody.

273
00:17:17.561 --> 00:17:21.040
Nobody's going to be working one day a week and getting six figures. Right?

274
00:17:21.070 --> 00:17:21.821
So they know that,

275
00:17:21.821 --> 00:17:25.240
but they also know that not everyone who fails will get a refund,

276
00:17:25.460 --> 00:17:29.230
just it's just odd. So they just count on most people not asking for a refund.

277
00:17:29.231 --> 00:17:32.200
That's how they make their money. But nonetheless, he really tries to hit home.

278
00:17:32.201 --> 00:17:33.790
That man, he's such a good guy.

279
00:17:33.910 --> 00:17:36.880
<v 1>Biggest companies, 100 billion,</v>

280
00:17:36.881 --> 00:17:41.620
$1 trillion companies like best buy and Amazon only offer

281
00:17:41.650 --> 00:17:45.580
amazingly 15 and 30 day guarantee respectively.

282
00:17:46.180 --> 00:17:50.340
But that's that greedy CEO, corporate BS laughing at you again,

283
00:17:50.580 --> 00:17:51.413
go figure.

284
00:17:52.290 --> 00:17:53.130
<v 0>Go figure.</v>

285
00:17:54.060 --> 00:17:54.893
<v 1>I,</v>

286
00:17:55.410 --> 00:17:59.310
Adrian [inaudible] is willing to double,

287
00:18:00.600 --> 00:18:03.810
quadruple their guarantee window because I have zero down mine.

288
00:18:04.460 --> 00:18:08.030
<v 0>Oh, you're LA. I'm not even going to let you finish this lie. Okay. He says,</v>

289
00:18:08.060 --> 00:18:09.410
Oh man, I'm doubled their offer.

290
00:18:09.440 --> 00:18:13.280
He says that he's got a 60 day money back guarantee refund. Okay.

291
00:18:13.310 --> 00:18:15.170
Let's take that apart. First of all,

292
00:18:15.171 --> 00:18:17.480
I've already explained to you that that's part of their calculation. Right?

293
00:18:17.540 --> 00:18:18.380
But secondly,

294
00:18:18.410 --> 00:18:23.390
it's standard for ClickBank ClickBank at his discretion will allow

295
00:18:23.391 --> 00:18:27.530
for the replacement or return of any product within 60 days of purchase. Stop.

296
00:18:27.531 --> 00:18:30.740
Pretending like you're the good guy. That's just their standard return policy.

297
00:18:31.460 --> 00:18:35.900
Hey yeah. You probably would have tried to get around it if you could.

298
00:18:36.320 --> 00:18:38.630
I mean, don't act like you're some good guy. Oh,

299
00:18:38.840 --> 00:18:41.960
that's the greedy corporate BS, bro.

300
00:18:42.020 --> 00:18:45.650
You were forced to offer a refund. So shut your mouth. Oh wait.

301
00:18:45.710 --> 00:18:48.380
There's more actually. Hey, check out what I just found.

302
00:18:48.710 --> 00:18:51.760
This is the six-figure Sunday's terms of service. Oh, look,

303
00:18:51.761 --> 00:18:55.760
let's look at this updated January of 2019. Okay.

304
00:18:56.120 --> 00:18:59.000
So let's see here. Uh, the refund, oops,

305
00:18:59.060 --> 00:19:02.060
looks like we've got a 30 day refund. Interesting.

306
00:19:02.540 --> 00:19:05.810
And then it's actually an action-based refund. So you have to,

307
00:19:06.110 --> 00:19:09.050
it looks like you have to create a landing page that gets a thousand visits,

308
00:19:09.080 --> 00:19:10.400
which isn't easy to do.

309
00:19:10.790 --> 00:19:15.680
But then check out the little note where the greedy corporate BS guy,

310
00:19:15.681 --> 00:19:16.730
he doesn't do that.

311
00:19:16.850 --> 00:19:20.030
Look at what he does due to the tremendous value throughout the course.

312
00:19:20.031 --> 00:19:24.560
You will not be eligible for a refund if you purchase the six-figure Sunday at a

313
00:19:24.561 --> 00:19:27.920
discount price. So what does that mean? Ladies and gentlemen,

314
00:19:27.921 --> 00:19:30.740
this guy who says I'm not going to do the corporate BS. Well,

315
00:19:30.741 --> 00:19:34.820
it means that no one who buys his product is eligible for any refund.

316
00:19:35.390 --> 00:19:39.290
This guy, this guy, this guy right here,

317
00:19:40.220 --> 00:19:41.720
won't offer you a refund. Look at this guy.

<v 1>Easily 15 and 30 day guarantee respectively,</v>

319

go figure I Adrian [inaudible] little

321
00:19:56.390 --> 00:19:58.400
me is willing to double,

322
00:19:58.700 --> 00:20:03.680

six figure Sunday will work for you.

324
00:20:05.900 --> 00:20:08.210
<v 0>Bro. You literally wrote it in the fine print.</v>

325
00:20:08.360 --> 00:20:11.330
Then nobody's going to read and you know it that you actually can't get a

326
00:20:11.331 --> 00:20:14.180
refund. You lying hypocrite.

327
00:20:14.540 --> 00:20:19.520
