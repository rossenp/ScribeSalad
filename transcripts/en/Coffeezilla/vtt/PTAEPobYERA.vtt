00:00:02.670 --> 00:00:05.540
Get rich quick are phrases.

We hear thrown around a lot more these days. Now that COVID has wiped.

4
00:00:09.951 --> 00:00:14.210
A lot of people out left. A lot of people, extremely desperate without jobs,

00:00:14.240 --> 00:00:15.380
without income.

11
00:00:31.850 --> 00:00:36.560
The problem is that there's liars on YouTube who want to, uh,

12
00:00:36.620 --> 00:00:38.780
trick you into buying things.

13
00:00:38.781 --> 00:00:43.100

Free app pays $500 per day. Worldwide.

21

No surveys make money online and you might be wondering is any of this real

22
00:01:14.330 --> 00:01:18.020
what's going on here? What happened? And to learn,

23
00:01:18.350 --> 00:01:22.850
this is why I'm here to serve service a bit of a bit of a

24
00:01:22.970 --> 00:01:24.980
historian of the internet. Okay?

25
00:01:25.250 --> 00:01:28.700
Because I'm here to take you back to understand what's going on here.

26
00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:32.300
How weird this is? Why are they saying like copy paste?

27
00:01:32.720 --> 00:01:35.690
Why is everyone putting make money online in the title? You know,

28
00:01:35.691 --> 00:01:37.700
why are they using such gigantic numbers?

29
00:01:37.701 --> 00:01:41.300
Like earn a thousand dollars on autopilot with this free website.

30
00:01:41.510 --> 00:01:43.400
Understand that guys,

31
00:01:44.180 --> 00:01:48.620
we have to go back in time and we have to talk about Goku. Okay.

32
00:01:50.090 --> 00:01:52.310
Hell just took a weird turn. I swear. I'm not a nerd.

33
00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:55.760
I'm trying to relate to you. Kitties kiddos, right?

34
00:01:55.790 --> 00:02:00.500
Y'all care about dragon mozzies to have the new hip thing. Uh, is,

35
00:02:00.830 --> 00:02:04.250
am I a boomer? Is this, what does nobody watch? Dragon won't see anymore. Okay.

36
00:02:04.310 --> 00:02:07.760
I am not going to go deep here, but if you remember the show,

37
00:02:08.660 --> 00:02:12.560
there's something called power creep that happens at dragon ball Z basically.

38
00:02:12.770 --> 00:02:15.860
He's uh, his super fighting form, super sayin.

39
00:02:16.280 --> 00:02:18.770
He takes like forever to figure out how to get to that.

40
00:02:19.250 --> 00:02:23.300
But once he gets to that level, then after that, as a viewer,

41
00:02:23.301 --> 00:02:26.750
you're kind of bored. If he just goes super saying one, right?

42
00:02:27.260 --> 00:02:29.240
And so you got to go super saying too.

43
00:02:29.810 --> 00:02:33.170
And so then this is where the power creep starts and then, Oh,

44
00:02:33.171 --> 00:02:36.780
well that's kind of boring now. Now how can we push this further? Right? Oh,

45
00:02:36.860 --> 00:02:39.620
we got to go further. Now. I know you're thinking, Steven,

46
00:02:40.010 --> 00:02:43.460
what the hell does that have to do with making money online? Okay.

47
00:02:43.550 --> 00:02:45.830
To understand the make money online space.

48
00:02:45.831 --> 00:02:48.320
You have to understand that everyone's trying to each other,

49
00:02:48.560 --> 00:02:53.360
what used to be a big deal is no longer a big deal. Declaim look, look,

50
00:02:53.361 --> 00:02:54.290
look, here's John.

51
00:02:54.291 --> 00:02:58.400
Crestani sort of the King of exaggerations on his whiteboard.

52
00:02:58.401 --> 00:03:03.250
He has quick big money. This is like, I would say John Crestani,

53
00:03:03.330 --> 00:03:07.450
he's like the super sand level, two of fake gurus, right?

54
00:03:07.480 --> 00:03:08.770
He's pretty far up there.

55
00:03:09.370 --> 00:03:13.240
And he was pretty extreme when he came out with all his insane, get rich,

56
00:03:13.270 --> 00:03:16.290
quick claims. But here's what he says very quickly.

57
00:03:16.291 --> 00:03:17.790
And I'm going to walk you through this method.

58
00:03:17.940 --> 00:03:21.570
Step-by-step so that you can get a big amount of money.

59
00:03:21.571 --> 00:03:26.160
I'm talking nearly $500 sent straight to your bank account in

60
00:03:26.161 --> 00:03:30.300
one day. Okay? So that's that's 2019 quick,

61
00:03:30.301 --> 00:03:33.660
big money is $500. Okay?

62
00:03:34.020 --> 00:03:36.060
So now with that little history lesson out of the way,

63
00:03:36.270 --> 00:03:39.150
let's go back and all of a sudden things are going to make sense.

64
00:03:39.151 --> 00:03:41.490
We're going to go to the investors channel.

65
00:03:41.820 --> 00:03:44.400
This kid is who I want to talk about today.

66
00:03:44.910 --> 00:03:49.230
This is the YouTuber who honestly is eliminating poverty with his videos.

67
00:03:49.350 --> 00:03:51.480
It's very impressive. I mean,

68
00:03:51.510 --> 00:03:55.590
all the make money online YouTubers are eliminating poverty, but this kid,

69
00:03:55.591 --> 00:03:58.110
especially cause wait till you see some of his videos. I mean, you know,

70
00:03:58.111 --> 00:04:01.560
those like UNICEF commercials where they're talking about like ending hunger and

71
00:04:01.561 --> 00:04:02.394
poverty.

72
00:04:02.910 --> 00:04:06.600
<v 1>Children are dying every day from hunger and sickness.</v>

73
00:04:07.080 --> 00:04:10.350
<v 0>That's because they haven't heard of the investor. Nine months ago,</v>

74
00:04:10.351 --> 00:04:13.110
he was saying earn $500 a day on autopilot.

75
00:04:13.980 --> 00:04:17.670
Nowadays he's saying, Oh, earn a thousand dollars a day.

76
00:04:17.910 --> 00:04:22.560
And now we are up to $1,200 a day,

77
00:04:23.250 --> 00:04:25.890
$5,000 day, $1,200 a day.

78
00:04:26.340 --> 00:04:31.320
The power creep has gotten to the point that his latest video

79
00:04:31.770 --> 00:04:36.390
is $2,000 in 30 minutes for free done

80
00:04:36.570 --> 00:04:37.403
for you.

81
00:04:40.500 --> 00:04:45.300
This is the gig dude. This is super say in three, 3.0, right?

82
00:04:45.480 --> 00:04:46.470
So this is his video.

83
00:04:46.471 --> 00:04:50.700
This is the pinnacle of make money online content.

84
00:04:50.730 --> 00:04:55.200
And I want you to notice now he really emphasizes how much work you need to do

85
00:04:55.201 --> 00:04:57.360
to get this stuff done. He really makes it hard on you.

86
00:04:57.660 --> 00:05:00.090
<v 1>No selling, no camera,</v>

87
00:05:00.270 --> 00:05:03.600
no investment and no social media followers.

88
00:05:05.430 --> 00:05:08.460
<v 0>In fact, you don't even have to lift a finger, screw a date on that.</v>

89
00:05:08.930 --> 00:05:10.950
I've got to throw out the believability right away.

90
00:05:10.951 --> 00:05:15.060
If you clicked on this video. Yeah. Uh, maybe you're not so bright.

91
00:05:15.510 --> 00:05:19.170
Do thousand dollars a day in 30 minutes for free done for you dude,

92
00:05:19.200 --> 00:05:22.230
even get rich, quick. Scammers are like, okay, cover it.

93
00:05:22.260 --> 00:05:23.670
You gotta be a little realistic.

94
00:05:23.700 --> 00:05:28.350
Are you getting 30 minutes for free done for

95
00:05:28.351 --> 00:05:33.270
you guys? If this were real. And he says, it's worldwide, by the way.

96
00:05:33.300 --> 00:05:35.580
So don't worry if you're not in America, right?

97
00:05:36.240 --> 00:05:38.130
<v 1>This works all around the world.</v>

98
00:05:38.131 --> 00:05:41.820
And I even did the hardest part for easy.

99
00:05:41.900 --> 00:05:46.200
<v 0>Street guys. We're on easy street. This man's eliminating poverty.</v>

100
00:05:46.201 --> 00:05:49.960
I want you to appreciate that guys. So it's worldwide. It's done for you.

101
00:05:50.340 --> 00:05:54.300
Can someone please tell Alyssa mulatto that they need to talk to the investor

102
00:05:54.301 --> 00:05:56.760
place? I can't do it by myself guys.

103
00:05:56.960 --> 00:06:00.830
Every like on this video is a message sent to Alyssa Mulana.

104
00:06:01.630 --> 00:06:04.900
<v 2>But with your support and just 50 cents a day.</v>

105
00:06:06.730 --> 00:06:09.700
<v 0>50 Cents a day node, that's nothing.</v>

106
00:06:09.760 --> 00:06:14.350
If everyone would just could watch the investor, that's the name of the channel?

107
00:06:14.380 --> 00:06:15.213
The investor,

108
00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:20.770
they'd all be making $32,000 every day for eight hours of work.

109
00:06:21.250 --> 00:06:24.430
That's how much money you can make. If you make $2,000, every 30 minutes,

110
00:06:25.420 --> 00:06:29.290
$4,000 an hour, 8,000 or $32,000 for eight hours.

111
00:06:35.320 --> 00:06:35.470
<v 2>Oh.</v>

112
00:06:35.470 --> 00:06:38.740
<v 0>Oh my gosh. And look, I wouldn't be talking about it.</v>

113
00:06:38.741 --> 00:06:41.620
If people didn't believe it, look at this stuff, Hey guys,

114
00:06:41.621 --> 00:06:46.360
let's make money online. We can do this. Uh, not audio, not here. You can't.

115
00:06:46.361 --> 00:06:50.320
And really what he's doing is he the real genius behind this? If you ask me,

116
00:06:50.321 --> 00:06:52.240
is you're collecting a,

117
00:06:52.241 --> 00:06:56.440
a short list of all the sheep on YouTube. Okay.

118
00:06:56.710 --> 00:06:59.920
If you think about what advertising get rich quick scams do,

119
00:07:00.280 --> 00:07:02.410
is it basically creates a lead list,

120
00:07:02.500 --> 00:07:05.860
a hot list for who's interested in get rich quick scams,

121
00:07:06.070 --> 00:07:07.900
and then you can sell them a get rich quick scam.

122
00:07:08.020 --> 00:07:10.360
Because as we know a lot of these courses, they're just get rich quick schemes.

123
00:07:10.690 --> 00:07:14.230
So, uh, yeah. Look at that. He's selling a course. Of course he is.

124
00:07:14.530 --> 00:07:18.040
Let's go check that out. Surely this isn't a get rich quick scheme.

125
00:07:19.240 --> 00:07:22.150
He said, sarcastically setting up the next segment.

126
00:07:22.510 --> 00:07:27.460
Are you ready to make $10,000 per month on YouTube? No camera, no BS,

127
00:07:27.490 --> 00:07:30.550
no affiliate, no work, but here's my favorite part.

128
00:07:30.551 --> 00:07:34.000
So he's got a video pitching it or whatever. It's like 300 bucks.

129
00:07:34.900 --> 00:07:37.180
This is my favorite part though, at the bottom,

130
00:07:37.420 --> 00:07:42.280
this is not a get rich quick program like Bernie Madoff saying, uh,

131
00:07:42.340 --> 00:07:44.380
this is not a Ponzi scheme. Hey,

132
00:07:44.440 --> 00:07:48.340
this is before you and fast want you to know not a Ponzi scheme or it's like

133
00:07:48.370 --> 00:07:53.260
Herbalife being like, Hey guys, just so we're clear. We are not a pyramid game.

134
00:07:53.350 --> 00:07:56.680
Wants you to be clear on that. And they're like showing you their comp plan.

135
00:07:57.700 --> 00:08:01.750
It's triangles shaped. It's not actually a pyramid,

136
00:08:02.260 --> 00:08:06.190
but the crazy thing I think to me is that this guy's getting real views. I mean,

137
00:08:06.191 --> 00:08:11.080
at the end of the day, he's getting like legitimate views on his channel, um,

138
00:08:11.140 --> 00:08:12.520
from posting this crap.

139
00:08:12.550 --> 00:08:15.280
And what it shows is that is that there's a real audience for this.

140
00:08:15.640 --> 00:08:18.610
There's a hunger for get rich quick content.

141
00:08:19.000 --> 00:08:21.160
And of course there's because we're in the middle of a pandemic.

142
00:08:21.700 --> 00:08:24.460
So it frustrates me because, you know,

143
00:08:24.461 --> 00:08:26.710
as somebody who is trying to protect people from this stuff,

144
00:08:27.130 --> 00:08:31.090
I feel almost helpless. That's why I need you guys to smash like on this video.

145
00:08:31.091 --> 00:08:35.440
So we can notify more people of this, these scams. But, um,

146
00:08:35.500 --> 00:08:39.190
two months ago, almost half a million views, step one.

147
00:08:39.370 --> 00:08:40.960
And that's not because it's a good video.

148
00:08:40.961 --> 00:08:44.620
It's just because people are searching the stuff left and right. They want,

149
00:08:44.650 --> 00:08:47.830
they're desperate to make money. That's all there is to it.

150
00:08:48.040 --> 00:08:51.610
And this guy is stealing their money, selling them worthless courses,

151
00:08:51.880 --> 00:08:54.940
or just wasting their time with this crap. Look at,

152
00:08:55.080 --> 00:08:57.960
I'm just trying to help my mama pay the bills the way she did for me.

153
00:08:59.280 --> 00:09:01.350
It's sad to say this. Ain't going to do it.

154
00:09:02.010 --> 00:09:03.780
<v 2>Bruh. What do you expect.</v>

155
00:09:03.780 --> 00:09:07.240
<v 0>Typing and make money online into YouTube. Unfortunately, it's just this it's,</v>

156
00:09:07.241 --> 00:09:09.840
it's a hot term right now. He's this guy's basically promising.

157
00:09:10.020 --> 00:09:10.950
It's going to eliminate poverty.

158
00:09:10.951 --> 00:09:14.010
And the truth is he's helping keep people in the poor house. Also,

159
00:09:14.011 --> 00:09:17.100
he can enrich himself from his course. Oh, by the way, before he leave,

160
00:09:17.101 --> 00:09:19.680
I just wanted to point out, you know, that course I showed you earlier.

161
00:09:19.681 --> 00:09:23.100
This course right here, it's just Caleb Maddix, like 2.0,

162
00:09:23.101 --> 00:09:24.450
it's just another YouTube course.

163
00:09:24.780 --> 00:09:28.890
And what he's really going to teach you is how to make, make money online.

164
00:09:29.280 --> 00:09:30.113

<v 0>With a bunch of B roll. Like he does.</v>

166
00:09:34.020 --> 00:09:37.080
You can be just like him scamming other people. See it's a pot.

168
00:09:40.420 --> 00:09:45.050
<v 0>Of course you start making content to trick other people and they'll get scammed</v>

169
00:09:45.051 --> 00:09:46.910
until they decide to start scamming other people.

170
00:09:46.911 --> 00:09:50.870
And we can just all scam each other. But anyways, I hope this was educational,
