00:00:00.060 --> 00:00:02.580
<v 0>Ladies and gentlemen, I'm here to respond to Stephanie Georgie,</v>

2
00:00:02.820 --> 00:00:05.910
who said that my video confessions of a copywriter was unfair to the industry

3
00:00:05.911 --> 00:00:09.330
and falsely painted them in a bad light. Hey,

4
00:00:09.360 --> 00:00:11.880
it's just a few bad apples in direct response.

5
00:00:12.180 --> 00:00:14.190
Most of them are doing it ethically.

6
00:00:14.220 --> 00:00:18.450
So I'm making this response in return called delusions of a copywriter. Now,

7
00:00:18.990 --> 00:00:22.140
Stephanie has a special reason for wanting to defend his profession. Number one,

8
00:00:22.350 --> 00:00:26.580
he sold $700 million worth of product. So, okay. It's what he does. That's fine.

9
00:00:27.090 --> 00:00:27.120
Um,

10
00:00:27.120 --> 00:00:31.950
but also he's engaged in some of the terrible practices that I describe in my

11
00:00:31.951 --> 00:00:33.750
video, but I wanted to say,

12
00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:37.710
because I think I'll probably offend a few people in this video right up top.

13
00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:42.750
I think most direct response copywriting that is going on right now in

14
00:00:42.751 --> 00:00:45.510
this industry is ethically indefensible.

15
00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:48.150
And I also want it to throw down the gauntlet. Look,

16
00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:51.450
if you disagree with that statement, come on the show.

17
00:00:51.900 --> 00:00:55.590
I'm happy to give you a platform. If you think any of this that's in Stephan,

18
00:00:55.950 --> 00:00:58.050
Georgie's little post here is defensible.

19
00:00:58.080 --> 00:01:01.650
Please come on the show because I think it'd be a great conversation to have,

20
00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:03.900
because so far, you know,

21
00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:06.630
you just post in this Facebook group where everyone agrees with you.

22
00:01:06.631 --> 00:01:08.730
What are we going to do right now?

23
00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:14.000
Notice I did not say that all copywriting is ethically indefensible or all

24
00:01:14.001 --> 00:01:16.250
direct response. Copywriting is ethically indefensible.

25
00:01:16.370 --> 00:01:19.310
Cause I don't think it is. I think there are ethical copywriters,

26
00:01:19.340 --> 00:01:21.740
definitely out there, which makes the first thing.

27
00:01:21.741 --> 00:01:25.160
This guy says that the main premise of my book is direct response, copywriting,

28
00:01:25.161 --> 00:01:27.380
a scammy and responsible for ripping people off false.

29
00:01:27.500 --> 00:01:31.430
And maybe that's because he only watched the first 20 minutes or so,

30
00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:34.130
but, uh, yeah, that's wrong.

31
00:01:34.310 --> 00:01:38.630
The main premise is actually that the majority of directors

32
00:01:38.930 --> 00:01:41.450
copywriting is scammy and responsible for ripping people off.

33
00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:45.020
There's ethical copywriting. Obviously there's ethical copywriting,

34
00:01:45.050 --> 00:01:46.640
obviously a small difference,

35
00:01:46.641 --> 00:01:49.880
but an important distinction because I'm not painting. He,

36
00:01:49.881 --> 00:01:53.540
his whole point is that I paint the whole industry with one brush. No,

37
00:01:53.600 --> 00:01:57.830
I just happened to be talking about the most predatory side of the industry,

38
00:01:57.831 --> 00:02:01.670
but I'm not painting the whole industry with one brush, but anyways,

39
00:02:01.730 --> 00:02:05.420
let's talk about what he says, okay, I'm going to have to summarize it.

40
00:02:05.450 --> 00:02:09.560
But if you want to read the whole post, I will leave it in the description.

41
00:02:09.890 --> 00:02:13.610
So basically he says, look, direct response, copywriting,

42
00:02:14.630 --> 00:02:17.360
normal advertising Coca-Cola Hey, uh,

43
00:02:17.750 --> 00:02:20.660
Gora Coca-Cola Swiffer new market health.

44
00:02:20.690 --> 00:02:22.670
What's really the difference right now.

45
00:02:22.700 --> 00:02:27.440
He does concede that some of the claims in copywriting are a little ridiculous,

46
00:02:27.770 --> 00:02:30.590
but he says, look, when it comes to the product, things like this,

47
00:02:30.591 --> 00:02:33.290
it's about the same, right? Some things work,

48
00:02:33.320 --> 00:02:37.130
some things kind of work and some things just are pixie dust. He calls it right.

49
00:02:37.430 --> 00:02:42.410
And he concludes it with this example, look, he says, Swiffer sweeper.

50
00:02:42.680 --> 00:02:44.480
They kind of lie to you in their ad.

51
00:02:44.510 --> 00:02:48.080
They make it look so easy to pick up dust and spills.

52
00:02:48.260 --> 00:02:50.150
And does it really work that well? So he says, look,

53
00:02:50.210 --> 00:02:51.710
it goes into the mixed results back,

54
00:02:51.980 --> 00:02:56.390
but does that mean Swiffer is preying on the weak or that they're a scammy

55
00:02:56.391 --> 00:02:59.290
company that should be banned from advertising on TV.

56
00:02:59.560 --> 00:03:01.720
Seems hard to make that leap in my mind.

57
00:03:01.840 --> 00:03:05.110
So he equates what he does to the Swiffer sweeper.

58
00:03:05.650 --> 00:03:10.450
Now let's dig into what he does because notice he didn't bring up

59
00:03:10.480 --> 00:03:12.730
any of the products, indirect response.

60
00:03:12.790 --> 00:03:15.250
And I think that was smart of him because if he had,

61
00:03:15.280 --> 00:03:18.730
it would have started to look pretty ridiculous because let's talk about one of

62
00:03:18.731 --> 00:03:20.800
the products Stephan, Georgie has sold.

63
00:03:20.890 --> 00:03:23.110
And I apologize for not using a more recent one,

64
00:03:23.111 --> 00:03:26.500
but honestly it's hard to find out what these people have written about because

65
00:03:26.501 --> 00:03:27.700
their names aren't on anything.

66
00:03:27.701 --> 00:03:30.930
You kind of have to hunt down what they are actually attached to.

67
00:03:31.210 --> 00:03:35.500
So he definitely wrote this. This is something called memory healer. Okay.

68
00:03:35.740 --> 00:03:36.880
Now ask yourself,

69
00:03:36.940 --> 00:03:41.650
do you think this is about the same level of predatory as Swiffer sweeper,

70
00:03:41.830 --> 00:03:45.130
the evil broom company. Do you think this is slightly more predatory?

71
00:03:45.131 --> 00:03:48.160
Do you think this is definitely more predatory? What do you think?

72
00:03:48.580 --> 00:03:53.080
Maybe Swiffer sweepers more predatory. Okay.

73
00:03:53.490 --> 00:03:54.210
<v 1>Hi,</v>

74
00:03:54.210 --> 00:03:59.070
my name is Alexander Lynch and the incredible story you're about to hear is

75
00:03:59.071 --> 00:04:00.600
100% true.

76
00:04:00.870 --> 00:04:02.850
<v 0>Actually first let's start with some irony.</v>

77
00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:04.800
The story is a hundred percent false.

78
00:04:05.190 --> 00:04:06.630
<v 1>About three and a half years ago.</v>

79
00:04:07.080 --> 00:04:11.820
My father pointed a shotgun to my face and pulled the trigger.

80
00:04:12.630 --> 00:04:15.720
He didn't do it because he was a psycho or because there was some sort of a

81
00:04:15.721 --> 00:04:20.370
family feud. It happened because when I unintentionally startled him,

82
00:04:21.180 --> 00:04:24.990
his early stage two Alzheimer's, which at that time hadn't been diagnosed,

83
00:04:25.470 --> 00:04:29.400
caused him to become panicked and confused, running to the closet.

84
00:04:29.670 --> 00:04:33.330
He pulled out his 12 gauge and fired it right at my head.

85
00:04:33.990 --> 00:04:38.190
He simply believed he was protecting his home and didn't realize that he almost

86
00:04:38.191 --> 00:04:39.600
murdered his only son.

87
00:04:40.290 --> 00:04:44.340
It was most disturbing and horrifying experiences for both of us.

88
00:04:44.580 --> 00:04:47.220
Something that still gives me nightmares to this day.

89
00:04:48.060 --> 00:04:50.040
And it's also what sent me on a complete.

90
00:04:50.400 --> 00:04:52.620
<v 0>By the way, I know that this seems like ridiculous,</v>

91
00:04:52.621 --> 00:04:55.560
like who would fall for this, but who is this product targeted towards?

92
00:04:55.561 --> 00:04:58.350
It's about Alzheimer's right. It's targeted towards seniors.

93
00:04:58.351 --> 00:05:02.640
So they're actually trying to scare seniors or maybe the seniors,

94
00:05:02.700 --> 00:05:05.610
a son or daughter. So look,

95
00:05:06.030 --> 00:05:08.160
so what they're taking advantage of seniors,

96
00:05:08.190 --> 00:05:09.510
isn't that the same as selling a Swift.

97
00:05:10.170 --> 00:05:13.590
<v 1>Slightly unexpected two year long journey through the dark underbelly of the</v>

98
00:05:13.591 --> 00:05:16.020
multi-billion dollar corporate medicine universe,

99
00:05:16.590 --> 00:05:21.570
a journey that opened my eyes to the sick predatory and ultimately

100
00:05:21.600 --> 00:05:24.570
deadly practices of the pharmaceutical conglomerates.

101
00:05:25.080 --> 00:05:28.710
And that would eventually lead to the discovery of a completely natural

102
00:05:28.950 --> 00:05:33.900
100% effective way that could reverse even the most severe cases

103
00:05:33.901 --> 00:05:35.670
of Alzheimer's dementia.

104
00:05:36.390 --> 00:05:41.250
<v 0>Oops. Hey, this is not the Swiffer sweeper.</v>

105
00:05:41.580 --> 00:05:46.440
You're trying to scare seniors into selling them a a hundred

106
00:05:46.441 --> 00:05:51.420
percent effective way that could reverse the most severe cases of Alzheimer's

107
00:05:51.900 --> 00:05:55.830
and dementia, which by the way, incurable diseases.

108
00:05:56.100 --> 00:05:58.250
<v 1>No matter whether the one suffering was in the very.</v>

109
00:05:58.250 --> 00:06:00.650
<v 0>Late, I don't even want to put you guys through this.</v>

110
00:06:00.860 --> 00:06:05.630
They're targeting people who are in their last stage of

111
00:06:05.631 --> 00:06:09.320
life and trying to milk them for all the money they're worth.

112
00:06:10.280 --> 00:06:11.113
Now,

113
00:06:11.180 --> 00:06:16.130
that is what I would call something that is preying on the weak or a

114
00:06:16.220 --> 00:06:20.270
scammy company that should be banned. That is what I'm talking about.

115
00:06:20.780 --> 00:06:24.530
And with that, I want to talk about what makes a predatory advertiser,

116
00:06:24.531 --> 00:06:28.550
because Devin doesn't seem to understand what makes a company predatory.

117
00:06:28.820 --> 00:06:29.653
It's pretty simple.

118
00:06:29.690 --> 00:06:33.980
What makes all the difference in the world is pushing your product onto

119
00:06:33.981 --> 00:06:35.780
desperate people who have no choice,

120
00:06:35.810 --> 00:06:38.930
but to buy it and overcharging them for it while you're at it.

121
00:06:38.931 --> 00:06:43.190
So this happens primarily in two industries, two industries, by the way,

122
00:06:43.460 --> 00:06:47.810
which direct response, copywriters, love health and wealth.

123
00:06:48.050 --> 00:06:51.170
Okay. Now why do these attract desperate people? Well,

124
00:06:51.380 --> 00:06:54.980
because let's take the example of a health. Let's take the extreme case.

125
00:06:55.400 --> 00:06:59.990
Say you're offering a cancer drug, right? Someone's been told by their doctors,

126
00:06:59.991 --> 00:07:02.630
Hey, you're you're honestly, we have nothing left for you.

127
00:07:02.900 --> 00:07:05.600
That's usually when people go to these direct response copywriters,

128
00:07:05.601 --> 00:07:10.250
they're looking for a salvation, right? They're looking for a miracle pill.

129
00:07:10.670 --> 00:07:13.970
These are desperate people that will pay any price.

130
00:07:14.330 --> 00:07:18.110
And you appeal to them with products. Like the one we just saw,

131
00:07:18.260 --> 00:07:20.360
like this memory healer right here,

132
00:07:20.840 --> 00:07:24.860
you take their money and they have no recourse, but to buy it right,

133
00:07:24.890 --> 00:07:26.630
because you have to try it. You're going to try it either way.

134
00:07:26.660 --> 00:07:28.430
Even though it might look scummy,

135
00:07:28.431 --> 00:07:30.530
you might not trust the person you're going to buy it.

136
00:07:30.800 --> 00:07:32.870
The same is true with wealth products.

137
00:07:32.900 --> 00:07:36.950
If you tell me I'm going to get rich and I work at McDonald's a nine to five job

138
00:07:36.980 --> 00:07:41.780
making minimum wage, right? I'm going to buy your product, which in of itself,

139
00:07:41.810 --> 00:07:45.050
isn't the end of the world. But as you and I both know,

140
00:07:45.080 --> 00:07:49.190
most of these products simply do not work. Or if they do work,

141
00:07:49.220 --> 00:07:53.150
they work for 1%, maybe half a percent of people,

142
00:07:53.270 --> 00:07:56.900
not the a hundred percent success rate that is usually promised in the copy.

143
00:07:57.170 --> 00:08:01.280
That's what makes it predatory because you're preying on the lowest level,

144
00:08:01.281 --> 00:08:05.000
the lowest denominator of society to try to take their money.

145
00:08:05.270 --> 00:08:07.100
And that's who a lot of these people are targeting.

146
00:08:07.101 --> 00:08:11.120
It's not people who are well to do engineers, right?

147
00:08:11.121 --> 00:08:14.210
Who have their life together. It is desperate people,

148
00:08:14.270 --> 00:08:18.200
either a desperate mom who needs to lose weight and you're selling them. Some,

149
00:08:18.440 --> 00:08:20.630
some solution, you know, is not going to work.

150
00:08:20.660 --> 00:08:24.260
Or there's some old person you're selling them. Health cures that you know,

151
00:08:24.261 --> 00:08:28.220
is not going to work or they're young and you're selling them some get rich.

152
00:08:28.970 --> 00:08:31.790
Biz-op right. These are the classics of direct response.

153
00:08:31.820 --> 00:08:35.300
It's the foundation on which a lot of this industry is built.

154
00:08:35.450 --> 00:08:38.090
Now with that said with, uh, the,

155
00:08:38.450 --> 00:08:40.580
this obvious point debunked here,

156
00:08:41.090 --> 00:08:45.770
I want to go on because one of his biggest things that I take issue with is that

157
00:08:45.771 --> 00:08:48.530
look, he says to bait the whole industry as seedy and crappy. First of all,

158
00:08:48.531 --> 00:08:52.250
I didn't paint the whole industry. I just painted most of the industry, uh,

159
00:08:52.280 --> 00:08:54.860
as crappy because of some bad actors doesn't seem fair.

160
00:08:55.050 --> 00:08:57.330
Because when you look at the biggest players,

161
00:08:57.510 --> 00:09:01.830
most of whom I've written for what you find is they don't use sensational

162
00:09:01.831 --> 00:09:02.590
stories.

163
00:09:02.590 --> 00:09:06.450
They're incessantly focused on making sure their claims are legit and they

164
00:09:06.451 --> 00:09:09.900
really genuinely care about their products. Uh,

165
00:09:11.460 --> 00:09:12.870
are you nuts?

166
00:09:14.520 --> 00:09:18.240
This is exactly the point I'd make. But in reverse, look,

167
00:09:18.270 --> 00:09:22.080
I actually agree with Stephen that if you want to evaluate an industry,

168
00:09:22.110 --> 00:09:25.020
you don't look at the worst. You look at the best of the industry, right?

169
00:09:25.290 --> 00:09:26.640
The top of the industry.

170
00:09:27.000 --> 00:09:30.810
So when you look at the top of the advertising industry, who might you find,

171
00:09:30.811 --> 00:09:35.130
you might find, I don't know, Apple, they're selling a real product, right?

172
00:09:35.490 --> 00:09:40.440
You might find Amazons and you might find the Verizon wireless is you might find

173
00:09:40.740 --> 00:09:42.780
Coca Cola. These people look,

174
00:09:42.840 --> 00:09:46.110
you can argue that Cola is not going to bring you happiness.

175
00:09:46.111 --> 00:09:47.790
So that's like a little deceptive,

176
00:09:47.820 --> 00:09:50.970
but they're not appealing to people who are on their last leg. Okay.

177
00:09:51.390 --> 00:09:54.780
Now let's move away from that. And talk about direct response.

178
00:09:54.810 --> 00:09:57.600
If you look at the best in the direct response game, who do you talk about?

179
00:09:57.810 --> 00:10:01.320
Well, the obvious cases, a Gora right?

180
00:10:01.650 --> 00:10:03.960
They're the biggest company in direct response.

181
00:10:03.961 --> 00:10:08.190
And actually all Stephan Georgie should know because one of the companies they

182
00:10:08.191 --> 00:10:10.710
talk about training is a glorified financial.

183
00:10:11.190 --> 00:10:15.360
So this must be then one of the companies that, uh, Stephan really stands by,

184
00:10:15.390 --> 00:10:17.550
they don't use sensational stories.

185
00:10:18.210 --> 00:10:21.420
They're insistently focused on making sure their claims are legit.

186
00:10:21.960 --> 00:10:26.130
They really genuinely care about their products. Oh, do they? Hey,

187
00:10:26.490 --> 00:10:27.780
why don't we talk about that?

188
00:10:27.840 --> 00:10:32.190
This is something called a deep dive into the heart and mind of the financial

189
00:10:32.191 --> 00:10:33.360
publication buyer.

190
00:10:33.810 --> 00:10:38.010
This is done by the in-house copywriter at a Gore financial.

191
00:10:38.400 --> 00:10:41.760
And he's about to talk to salesmen who talked to their customers.

192
00:10:41.761 --> 00:10:44.670
And we're about to find out what they really believe.

193
00:10:44.940 --> 00:10:49.440
They say about their own customers. They really are looking for the magic pill.

194
00:10:49.770 --> 00:10:52.650
That would be my distillation of about 10 years.

195
00:10:52.680 --> 00:10:54.090
They're talking about their customers.

196
00:10:54.120 --> 00:10:56.490
They're looking for the financial magic pill.

197
00:10:56.520 --> 00:11:00.720
Now let me go out on a limb here and say that they're attracting customers who

198
00:11:00.721 --> 00:11:04.170
are looking for a magic pill because they're selling magic pills.

199
00:11:04.290 --> 00:11:06.330
And you might say, well, that's just my opinion,

200
00:11:06.720 --> 00:11:08.280
but consider how weird it would be.

201
00:11:08.310 --> 00:11:11.070
If a car salesman said that people were coming,

202
00:11:11.071 --> 00:11:13.350
looking for anything other than cars,

203
00:11:13.560 --> 00:11:15.960
you attract people based on what you're selling.

204
00:11:16.380 --> 00:11:20.400
So it stands to reason that if the distillation of 10 years of selling is that

205
00:11:20.550 --> 00:11:23.730
people come to your company looking for a magic pills. Well,

206
00:11:23.760 --> 00:11:24.960
what do you think you're selling?

207
00:11:25.230 --> 00:11:28.530
And it's not me saying that that's their own copywriter and salesman who admit

208
00:11:28.531 --> 00:11:30.480
that they say about their customers.

209
00:11:30.540 --> 00:11:33.870
It's a lot of people who are panicked back against the wall,

210
00:11:33.960 --> 00:11:37.140
trying to make up for lost time, sound like desperation to you.

211
00:11:37.260 --> 00:11:41.100
These people at the top of the direct response industry, Agoro financial,

212
00:11:41.550 --> 00:11:45.810
who step in says, Oh yeah, right. What did he say? Oh,

213
00:11:45.811 --> 00:11:50.220
they don't use sensational stories here. They are in their own words.

214
00:11:50.220 --> 00:11:55.180
Talking about using sensational stories. Yeah. Well the retire a millionaire.

215
00:11:55.181 --> 00:11:59.370
I don't know what it was. 30 day retirement blue. Yeah. That one.

216
00:11:59.610 --> 00:12:03.900
That was hell on the phone. People like, here's a good example of the power.

217
00:12:03.930 --> 00:12:08.400
Like you get it, the power of copy. Right. But when that promo first launched,

218
00:12:08.401 --> 00:12:11.940
I remember specifically, and this was God, probably six years ago.

219
00:12:11.941 --> 00:12:16.350
I talked to people out of retiring that day. Like two people were like,

220
00:12:16.380 --> 00:12:20.730
I'm going to go tell my boss off I'm out of here. I said,

221
00:12:20.790 --> 00:12:23.640
maybe you're going to want to give it the 30 days before you, well,

222
00:12:23.641 --> 00:12:24.510
let's talk about this.

223
00:12:24.780 --> 00:12:29.730
Protect your money and pile up as much as 794 profits during China's

224
00:12:29.731 --> 00:12:33.000
deliberate economic attack. OneAmerica Hey,

225
00:12:33.240 --> 00:12:37.620
does that sound like a curiosity inducing story or a sensational story?

226
00:12:38.100 --> 00:12:39.330
Right. Secondly,

227
00:12:39.331 --> 00:12:42.990
he says they are incessantly focused on making sure their claims are legit.

228
00:12:43.380 --> 00:12:45.930
This is also simply false. And again,

229
00:12:45.960 --> 00:12:50.250
I'm not taking the low hanging fruit of Stephan Georgie's, you know,

230
00:12:50.850 --> 00:12:54.420
memory Marie healer from several years ago, I could do that all day,

231
00:12:54.630 --> 00:12:57.780
but let me take the top players in your industry.

232
00:12:57.990 --> 00:13:02.940
People new market health who got sued by the federal trade commission for

233
00:13:02.941 --> 00:13:07.920
lying about diabetes. And again, if anyone wants to defend this and say that no,

234
00:13:07.921 --> 00:13:11.040
the big players industry are super honest. No,

235
00:13:11.041 --> 00:13:13.080
our industry isn't especially bad.

236
00:13:13.110 --> 00:13:17.400
Please come on and imagine for a second that some mainstream advertisers did

237
00:13:17.401 --> 00:13:22.260
this. They never would. This is uniquely a direct response copywriting problem.

238
00:13:22.560 --> 00:13:25.170
And the sooner people in the industry address it.

239
00:13:25.171 --> 00:13:28.080
The sooner you guys can move on to better practices,

240
00:13:28.200 --> 00:13:31.260
but I'll get into why I don't think that's going to happen in a second.

241
00:13:31.770 --> 00:13:35.430
Look at what they say. Do you suffer from type two diabetes? Well,

242
00:13:35.610 --> 00:13:38.430
maybe your doctor has told you to keep an eye on your blood sugar.

243
00:13:38.490 --> 00:13:42.630
This guy says there's a simple at-home treatment for type two diabetes.

244
00:13:42.780 --> 00:13:46.830
That has nothing to do with diet or exercise involves no drugs,

245
00:13:47.520 --> 00:13:52.260
reverse every symptom of diabetes in 28 days without changing your diet

246
00:13:52.470 --> 00:13:55.920
without spending a minute in the gym or taking a single drug. And no,

247
00:13:55.921 --> 00:14:00.360
I'm not even kidding. This is from one of the top players in your industry,

248
00:14:00.570 --> 00:14:02.040
your TV, your cell phone,

249
00:14:02.070 --> 00:14:06.060
even the computer screen you're watching on can slowly silently cause type two

250
00:14:06.061 --> 00:14:10.440
diabetes. And then they show a diabetes rate and then electronic device usage,

251
00:14:10.680 --> 00:14:14.040
this usage like that must be causation, right?

252
00:14:14.041 --> 00:14:16.500
That couldn't just be correlation abandoned your workouts,

253
00:14:17.010 --> 00:14:20.490
abandoned your insulin, just get IRR blockers. Totally insane.

254
00:14:20.730 --> 00:14:25.290
Now I'm going to argue that a lot of what makes Stephan wrong here is that

255
00:14:25.710 --> 00:14:30.210
he conflates the difference between illegal and unethical

256
00:14:30.510 --> 00:14:32.580
right there. Those are two very different things.

257
00:14:32.581 --> 00:14:35.370
There are a lot of things that are legal to do that.

258
00:14:35.371 --> 00:14:40.320
Many of us would consider unethical. Now, unfortunately, some of this industry,

259
00:14:40.321 --> 00:14:42.060
not all of it, certainly not all of it,

260
00:14:42.330 --> 00:14:47.310
but some of this industry thinks that if you ever try to start pushing back and

261
00:14:47.311 --> 00:14:49.320
saying, Hey, maybe this is unethical.

262
00:14:49.380 --> 00:14:53.960
Even if it's legal to do all of a sudden, Oh, you must Kate making money.

263
00:14:53.961 --> 00:14:57.200
You must Kate making money. That's what this guy says, Tim.

264
00:14:57.410 --> 00:15:01.640
I find that a lot of people who watch my channel is there to reconfirm their

265
00:15:01.641 --> 00:15:04.880
beliefs on making money. That everyone is a scam. Everyone is greedy.

266
00:15:04.910 --> 00:15:07.700
Everyone is bad. No, just you Tim.

267
00:15:07.760 --> 00:15:11.090
It's almost like they're trying to convince themselves that making a lot of

268
00:15:11.091 --> 00:15:14.150
money is evil again. No,

269
00:15:14.930 --> 00:15:19.430
but some ways of making money as evil selling the memory healer

270
00:15:19.790 --> 00:15:23.180
is evil. It's unethical. Even if Stephan,

271
00:15:23.690 --> 00:15:25.910
Georgie never technically got prosecuted for it.

272
00:15:26.210 --> 00:15:31.160
Even if it was never considered illegal, it is deeply unethical.

273
00:15:31.550 --> 00:15:35.600
And I don't know why that's a conversation. No one's willing to have,

274
00:15:35.810 --> 00:15:39.980
but because he conflates those two things, uh, he, he, when he says this,

275
00:15:39.981 --> 00:15:42.860
they're incessantly focused on making sure their claims are legit.

276
00:15:43.160 --> 00:15:46.520
It's what he's actually saying is they're incessantly focused on making sure

277
00:15:46.521 --> 00:15:51.230
their claims are legal. Not that they don't want vs claims.

278
00:15:51.410 --> 00:15:55.400
They want as many BS claims as they can possibly fit

279
00:15:56.210 --> 00:16:00.200
while staying legal. And once again, I'm going to show you proof of this.

280
00:16:00.201 --> 00:16:02.930
This is Jenny Thompson, CEO of new market health,

281
00:16:02.931 --> 00:16:06.710
which is a branch of a Gora here's her idea of legality.

282
00:16:06.740 --> 00:16:11.080
Notice the equation for what should be said is anything short of completely

283
00:16:11.360 --> 00:16:11.950
illegal?

284
00:16:11.950 --> 00:16:14.950
<v 2>Making sure again, that our claims are kind of right up to the line,</v>

285
00:16:15.190 --> 00:16:18.220
but not something that can get shut down, making sure again,

286
00:16:18.221 --> 00:16:20.740
that our claims are kind of right up to the line.

287
00:16:21.460 --> 00:16:23.020
<v 0>Um, and I could really do this all day.</v>

288
00:16:23.021 --> 00:16:25.930
I could go after sales letter after sales letter with you,

289
00:16:26.440 --> 00:16:29.440
but I think you get the point. The point is,

290
00:16:29.441 --> 00:16:34.240
is this is a ridiculous attempt to try to justify

291
00:16:34.570 --> 00:16:38.080
the really terrible things that are going on in this industry. And again,

292
00:16:38.110 --> 00:16:42.820
it's not the whole industry, but it is a lot of the big players he's lying.

293
00:16:42.821 --> 00:16:46.420
When he says that the big players are somehow the ethical ones.

294
00:16:46.450 --> 00:16:47.950
How do you figure that buddy?

295
00:16:48.220 --> 00:16:53.110
Here's Joseph Schrieffer one of the top guys at a Gora financial, uh,

296
00:16:53.140 --> 00:16:54.400
who we talked about earlier,

297
00:16:54.430 --> 00:16:58.750
who Stephen Mustang is a pinnacle of ethics since they're a big player.

298
00:16:58.751 --> 00:17:01.630
And he says the big players are all ethical. Here's him saying?

299
00:17:02.140 --> 00:17:05.020
We're simply trying to find out what the new rules will be.

300
00:17:05.021 --> 00:17:09.490
This is right after a Facebook ad crackdown, how that impacts our copy.

301
00:17:09.880 --> 00:17:14.230
And if we can still acquire customers with the water down claims,

302
00:17:14.260 --> 00:17:17.290
if we can't say you're going to make all this money to get promised you the

303
00:17:17.291 --> 00:17:19.210
moon, how who's going to buy our products.

304
00:17:19.240 --> 00:17:22.060
You'd never see this with a Coca-Cola ad.

305
00:17:22.270 --> 00:17:26.590
You'd never see this in an Apple ad. Hey, can we still acquire customers?

306
00:17:27.760 --> 00:17:28.593
Now? You'd never say that.

307
00:17:28.750 --> 00:17:32.080
Cause they're not saying they're going to make you 112% of your wealth.

308
00:17:32.230 --> 00:17:36.670
They're not appealing to desperate people in desperate situations.

309
00:17:36.880 --> 00:17:38.380
So I wanted to point that out,

310
00:17:38.560 --> 00:17:42.700
that difference that he fails to really highlight. He says, Oh,

311
00:17:42.910 --> 00:17:45.850
maybe we do a little bit more claims. So basically we're just,

312
00:17:45.880 --> 00:17:49.410
it's just a different medium, right? Hey, some of our work,

313
00:17:49.411 --> 00:17:52.950
some of them don't know your, your industry is unique.

314
00:17:52.980 --> 00:17:57.570
It's uniquely predatory because it preys on people in desperate situations.

315
00:17:58.170 --> 00:17:59.820
It uses ridiculous claims,

316
00:18:00.000 --> 00:18:04.170
way more over the top than any ad you'd ever see on TV.

317
00:18:04.170 --> 00:18:07.290
This is not Swiffer vs the memory healer.

318
00:18:07.320 --> 00:18:10.290
This is not Swiffer versus the diabetes cure of a Gore.

319
00:18:10.320 --> 00:18:13.380
They're not even in the same league and combine that with the fact that I've

320
00:18:13.381 --> 00:18:16.710
effectively debunked the idea that just because they're a big player, Oh,

321
00:18:16.711 --> 00:18:20.430
look at the big players there. They're ethical, right? They're the ethical ones.

322
00:18:20.460 --> 00:18:23.220
Sure. At the bottom, you may find problems. But look at the people at the top,

323
00:18:23.400 --> 00:18:26.880
Hey, we've looked at the people at the top, go look at a Gore,

324
00:18:26.910 --> 00:18:28.230
go look at their advertising.

325
00:18:28.470 --> 00:18:32.520
