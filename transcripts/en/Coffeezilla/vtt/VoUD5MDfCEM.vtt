00:00:00.090 --> 00:00:05.000
<v 0>The bottom line is Washington hates you. You might be wondering,</v>

2
00:00:05.001 --> 00:00:08.090
Steven, why are you talking about our government? I thought you'd covered scams.

3
00:00:09.380 --> 00:00:10.940
That'd be my answer. I do covers games.

4
00:00:10.941 --> 00:00:14.360
That's why we're talking about the COVID relief bill. Remember they told you,

5
00:00:14.630 --> 00:00:16.640
Hey, when COVID hit, they said,

6
00:00:16.641 --> 00:00:19.940
we're not going to leave you guys behind because we're massively incompetent.

7
00:00:19.941 --> 00:00:23.090
You know, we're going to take care of you. We're going to pass stimulus,

8
00:00:23.120 --> 00:00:27.680
checks money in your pocket. And you know what? Small businesses,

9
00:00:27.800 --> 00:00:29.330
we're not going to let you fail. Right?

10
00:00:29.450 --> 00:00:33.620
We got the PPP for you and look how well that turned out. Joel,

11
00:00:33.621 --> 00:00:37.460
Olsteen's getting a $4.4 million kickback, but don't worry. He needs it.

12
00:00:37.461 --> 00:00:42.440
He's a small up and coming pastor, Kanye, West little tiny shoe company.

13
00:00:42.620 --> 00:00:44.720
He needs the PPP to stay alive.

14
00:00:45.160 --> 00:00:47.840
It doesn't matter which side of the spectrum you're on. Listen,

15
00:00:47.841 --> 00:00:51.560
Mitch McConnell called this a historic relief bill. What's historic about it.

16
00:00:51.770 --> 00:00:54.350
Pete, you're getting 600 bucks. That's what they're giving you.

17
00:00:54.351 --> 00:00:56.600
You know what Nancy Pelosi says about it.

18
00:00:56.660 --> 00:01:00.710
She says it's a significant amount to America's working families.

19
00:01:00.980 --> 00:01:04.910
They are a significant, a significant amount.

20
00:01:05.120 --> 00:01:09.440
This lady is so out of touch. Listen, she got into politics in 1987, $600.

21
00:01:09.441 --> 00:01:11.750
Wasn't even a significant amount back then,

22
00:01:12.020 --> 00:01:15.380
but you're expected to take this lying down all the while that this thing is so

23
00:01:15.381 --> 00:01:18.320
stuffed with pork, that the Baconator is jealous. Listen guys,

24
00:01:18.740 --> 00:01:23.570
out of the $900 trillion that's being spent in this thing, Hey,

25
00:01:23.780 --> 00:01:27.830
you're getting 18% of it. Where's the rest of the money go? Well,

26
00:01:28.040 --> 00:01:29.900
a lot of it goes to the PPP program.

27
00:01:29.901 --> 00:01:33.470
Remember we need Kanye West and Joel Olsteen to get more money where the other

28
00:01:33.471 --> 00:01:38.270
part of this goes is detailed in a 5,000 page document that

29
00:01:38.271 --> 00:01:42.440
nobody has read. Not me, not anybody in the house or the Senate,

30
00:01:42.470 --> 00:01:46.960
but rest assured guys it's important. It's important stuff, guys,

31
00:01:46.970 --> 00:01:51.290
like a $10 million for gender programs in Pakistan.

32
00:01:51.291 --> 00:01:54.680
That's the kind of stuff that's getting passed in a COVID belt. And listen,

33
00:01:54.681 --> 00:01:56.390
you can be a fan of gender programs in Pakistan,

34
00:01:56.391 --> 00:02:00.110
but this has less to do with COVID than the furniture stimulus that was also

35
00:02:00.111 --> 00:02:03.320
passed. Oh, that's right. You see these guys right here.

36
00:02:03.321 --> 00:02:06.920
These two people who are supposedly on different sides of the aisle. Yeah.

37
00:02:07.610 --> 00:02:10.880
They need new furniture, guys. You guys understand that, right?

38
00:02:10.910 --> 00:02:14.390
They never let a good pandemic go to waste. Ladies and gentlemen,

39
00:02:14.900 --> 00:02:17.030
they've a lot of themselves. Hmm. How much is that?

40
00:02:17.630 --> 00:02:22.010
The $9 million for furniture for the cynic.

41
00:02:22.580 --> 00:02:23.413
Are you joking?

42
00:02:23.570 --> 00:02:26.840
I'm pretty sure you could buy an iron throne for each of the senators with that

43
00:02:26.841 --> 00:02:30.080
kind of money and still have money leftover. These people hate you.

44
00:02:31.100 --> 00:02:34.190
This is why I don't get political on my show, guys. I don't go left or right,

45
00:02:34.250 --> 00:02:37.520
because if you bat for one side of the team, you can't criticize the game.

46
00:02:37.580 --> 00:02:41.870
And the game is you get royally screwed and they get Royal Thrones to sit on

47
00:02:41.990 --> 00:02:45.620
what their $89 million for furniture now among other things that is bill,

48
00:02:45.621 --> 00:02:48.020
what else do we got here? What else guys? Well,

49
00:02:48.080 --> 00:02:49.760
these geniuses in Washington have, uh,

50
00:02:49.970 --> 00:02:53.990
officially made their policies on the succession and reincarnation of the Dalai

51
00:02:53.991 --> 00:02:57.380
Lama clear, which thank God for that. We were all worried.

52
00:02:57.680 --> 00:02:59.710
We all might die from pandemic.

53
00:02:59.740 --> 00:03:03.850
If we didn't figure out the succession of the Dalai Lama it's pages long,

54
00:03:03.851 --> 00:03:07.000
by the way, guys, the constitution, four pages long,

55
00:03:07.870 --> 00:03:12.010
one stimulus check. That's a no brainer that should have been passed months ago.

56
00:03:12.130 --> 00:03:14.080
Hey, 5,000 pages.

57
00:03:16.080 --> 00:03:17.070
<v 1>Oh, it's beyond.</v>

58
00:03:17.520 --> 00:03:19.620
<v 0>To give you guys an idea of how much,</v>

59
00:03:19.860 --> 00:03:22.770
how far $900 billion could have gone.

60
00:03:22.980 --> 00:03:25.650
Let's just say they gave this straight to the American people.

61
00:03:25.710 --> 00:03:30.660
Let's say they go, Hey, the PPP, that was a massive mistake,

62
00:03:30.661 --> 00:03:33.180
corruption everywhere. The money's going to the wrong people.

63
00:03:33.181 --> 00:03:35.850
It's not going to the small businesses. Like they say, they are, you know,

64
00:03:35.851 --> 00:03:38.310
you have people like a Atlantic diving supply,

65
00:03:38.370 --> 00:03:42.660
still qualifying as small businesses with over a billion dollars in revenue.

66
00:03:42.780 --> 00:03:45.810
That's a total joke. So they just gave it to the American people.

67
00:03:45.840 --> 00:03:47.820
Instead of getting a $600 check,

68
00:03:47.880 --> 00:03:51.420
every single person would be getting a $3,200 check. And listen,

69
00:03:52.110 --> 00:03:55.980
if you've been out of work for the last, I don't know, nine months,

70
00:03:56.100 --> 00:03:58.890
that's not even that much. That's not going to save your life.

71
00:03:58.891 --> 00:04:01.620
Like Congress is acting like $600.

72
00:04:01.830 --> 00:04:05.250
Is all of a sudden going to build a lifeboat and to give anything more would be,

73
00:04:05.370 --> 00:04:08.250
you know, Oh my gosh, they don't need that. That's ridiculous. Dude.

74
00:04:08.251 --> 00:04:13.050
People are so far behind $3,200 is a drop in the bucket and it's the

75
00:04:13.051 --> 00:04:14.010
least you can do.

76
00:04:14.040 --> 00:04:18.870
But instead of we're more worried about giving $130 million to Nepal

77
00:04:19.020 --> 00:04:23.220
or $453 million to Ukraine. Listen,

78
00:04:23.221 --> 00:04:25.290
I already saved Ukraine. Okay. My,

79
00:04:25.350 --> 00:04:29.160
my designer can tell you that we're wasting money on things like a billion

80
00:04:29.161 --> 00:04:33.540
dollars to the Smithsonian or $40 million to the Kennedy center,

81
00:04:33.570 --> 00:04:38.160
$154 million to the national art gallery. And look,

82
00:04:38.250 --> 00:04:39.720
I love art as much as the next guy,

83
00:04:39.870 --> 00:04:43.950
but I'm pretty sure having access to the number one 1950 by Jackson.

84
00:04:44.700 --> 00:04:47.250
Isn't the biggest priority on everyone's list.

85
00:04:47.490 --> 00:04:51.030
Now all of this insanity has led up to maybe the most surprising thing of all,

86
00:04:51.870 --> 00:04:53.790
uh, Donald Trump, making some sense on Twitter.

87
00:04:55.350 --> 00:04:59.910
<v 1>I am asking Congress to amend this bill and increase the ridiculously low</v>

88
00:05:00.480 --> 00:05:05.460
$600 to $2,000 or $4,000

89
00:05:05.520 --> 00:05:06.360
for a couple.

90
00:05:07.140 --> 00:05:11.820
I'm also asking Congress to immediately get rid of the wasteful and unnecessary

91
00:05:11.821 --> 00:05:14.100
items from this legislation.

92
00:05:14.310 --> 00:05:16.650
<v 0>Now I know a lot of people are just going to say, Hey,</v>

93
00:05:16.651 --> 00:05:21.090
this is just political theater, which sure probably is. Uh,

94
00:05:21.120 --> 00:05:23.850
but it doesn't make it any less true. You know, things can be true.

95
00:05:23.851 --> 00:05:27.150
Even if they come out of the mouth of a guy that you like, you dislike,

96
00:05:27.151 --> 00:05:29.940
it doesn't make the statement any less true.

97
00:05:29.970 --> 00:05:34.080
Congress needs to get rid of these ridiculous amendments to this.

98
00:05:34.110 --> 00:05:36.090
What should be a straightforward bill? You know,

99
00:05:36.330 --> 00:05:40.800
get relief into the hands of the American people that you forced to shut down

100
00:05:40.801 --> 00:05:44.460
their businesses. You know, the government forced to shut down their shops.

101
00:05:44.490 --> 00:05:48.540
So we could all chip in for each other for this pandemic. But all of a sudden,

102
00:05:48.541 --> 00:05:49.920
when it comes down to giving you money,

103
00:05:49.921 --> 00:05:54.000
you're left holding the bill and instead Sudan and Burma end up with all the

104
00:05:54.001 --> 00:05:57.120
money. While these two are left, trying to fist,

105
00:05:57.440 --> 00:06:00.230
I guess these people are an embarrassment. Anyways.

106
00:06:00.231 --> 00:06:04.730
I just wanted to cover that because it's just a historic level of

107
00:06:04.731 --> 00:06:08.720
scam artistry going on at the highest levels of government. Meanwhile,

108
00:06:08.721 --> 00:06:13.010
you're getting shafted and I wanted to document and guys, cause this is Janell.

109
00:06:13.011 --> 00:06:17.420
We cover scams. That's what we do. And this bill, this COVID relief bill.

110
00:06:17.600 --> 00:06:21.620
It's a scam it's COVID relief in name only. Thanks for watching.

111
00:06:21.860 --> 00:06:22.880
See you guys next time.

112
00:06:40.120 --> 00:06:40.120
<v 2>[Inaudible].</v>
