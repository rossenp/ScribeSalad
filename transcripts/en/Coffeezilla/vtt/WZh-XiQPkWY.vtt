00:00:00.060 --> 00:00:05.010
<v 0>Today, we got ourselves a package space, force dollars.</v>

2
00:00:05.200 --> 00:00:06.240
I got interested in these.

3
00:00:06.241 --> 00:00:10.980
When I saw an ad on YouTube that was advertising space

4
00:00:10.981 --> 00:00:14.490
force $2 bills, and they swore it was legal Tinder.

5
00:00:14.730 --> 00:00:18.300
Did this war was legal for 10 space for dollars.

6
00:00:18.301 --> 00:00:21.450
You know how much it costs a hundred dollars for $10. Here it is.

7
00:00:21.451 --> 00:00:24.660
Ladies and gentlemen, the space force $2 bill.

8
00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:27.360
There's no way anyone accepts this.

9
00:00:27.800 --> 00:00:29.810
Now I just want to jump in here because you might be wondering, well,

10
00:00:29.870 --> 00:00:34.610
is it legal? Is this a legal bill? And the answer is, I don't know. We,

11
00:00:34.611 --> 00:00:36.710
according to the, the private company who did this,

12
00:00:36.711 --> 00:00:38.570
this is not the government who printed this.

13
00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:43.550
This is a regular $2 bill that a private company has like colorized

14
00:00:43.551 --> 00:00:47.840
on top of it with some non-destructive film or something like that.

15
00:00:47.841 --> 00:00:51.320
I don't really understand it, but that has to have its limitations, right?

16
00:00:51.320 --> 00:00:55.700
Like this just looks ridiculous. And I want to know will people actually,

17
00:00:56.330 --> 00:00:59.240
we're going to go to a bunch of fast food restaurants and, uh,

18
00:00:59.300 --> 00:01:01.580
check who has been bought out by the Chinese.

19
00:01:01.581 --> 00:01:04.940
And who's still American will order something from a, their dollar menu.

20
00:01:05.120 --> 00:01:07.580
Try to pay with a $2 bill. We'll see who does it,

21
00:01:07.670 --> 00:01:11.540
who accepts it and who doesn't. I'm excited. I don't think anyone,

22
00:01:11.541 --> 00:01:14.570
if I had to guess, I'll try about five places today.

23
00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:16.670
I doubt anyone will accept it. Instead.

24
00:01:16.671 --> 00:01:19.100
I think we're going to find out that the a hundred dollars I spent was a

25
00:01:19.101 --> 00:01:22.790
complete waste of time. And, uh, I have gotten scammed. Oh,

26
00:01:22.910 --> 00:01:26.630
we've got a Wendy's here. I'll just take a small frosty, please.

27
00:01:27.740 --> 00:01:29.600
Hi, do you guys take space for us dollars?

28
00:01:33.320 --> 00:01:33.740
<v 1>You.</v>

29
00:01:33.740 --> 00:01:36.350
<v 0>They told me it was legal, legal Tinder. Genuine.</v>

30
00:01:40.340 --> 00:01:44.600
Donald told me it was real. They like colorize the $2 bill.

31
00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:50.420
<v 1>I mean, I guess we can, we just don't get a lot of $2 bills. No worries. Thanks.</v>

32
00:01:54.170 --> 00:01:57.590
<v 0>Wendy's 10 out of 10 patriotic confirmed baby.</v>

33
00:01:57.950 --> 00:02:00.330
I am totally shocked. That felt.

34
00:02:00.620 --> 00:02:03.440
<v 1>Too easy. Hey, I'm.</v>

35
00:02:03.440 --> 00:02:05.000
<v 0>Johnny space farce. That's it.</v>

36
00:02:08.630 --> 00:02:10.520
That's all there is to it up next.

37
00:02:10.521 --> 00:02:14.450
We have McDonald's I think handing them the Trump thing got them last time.

38
00:02:14.480 --> 00:02:17.210
I like if I had to think psychologically, I think that overloaded them.

39
00:02:17.720 --> 00:02:21.890
You don't get handed a certificate of authenticity from Donald Trump very often.

40
00:02:22.490 --> 00:02:27.020
So very interesting. How do you guys accept the a space force? $2 bill.

41
00:02:29.600 --> 00:02:30.433
<v 1>Hold on. Sure.</v>

42
00:02:31.880 --> 00:02:36.320
<v 0>Boy. Hey, by the way, if you need it, I got a certificate of authenticity here.</v>

43
00:02:40.340 --> 00:02:41.540
<v 1>I think he likes this.</v>

44
00:02:48.950 --> 00:02:53.030
Donald's going to be very happy. Thank you. This is not going.

45
00:02:53.050 --> 00:02:56.060
I thought, I thought nobody would accept this.

46
00:02:57.140 --> 00:03:00.310
<v 0>I saw someone here. Would you like would like space force dollars?</v>

47
00:03:01.590 --> 00:03:03.370
<v 1>I've got $2 bill and space for us dollars.</v>

48
00:03:06.220 --> 00:03:09.400
Seriously. It's a type of $2 bill.

49
00:03:11.770 --> 00:03:15.970
Do you want it? Yeah. It's real money. You just have to show them.

50
00:03:15.971 --> 00:03:20.260
This is Sean. This think that yeah, absolutely. God bless you.

51
00:03:20.680 --> 00:03:22.870
Saving America one space, horse dollar at a time.

52
00:03:23.280 --> 00:03:26.670
<v 0>That'd be honest. Driving home. I felt conflicted. On the one hand,</v>

53
00:03:26.671 --> 00:03:30.780
I was shocked that people accepted the money. On the other hand,

54
00:03:30.781 --> 00:03:35.220
I wonder how much my own persuasion played into that. Like I wondered,

55
00:03:35.221 --> 00:03:37.800
could I have just taken monopoly money and just been like, Hey, take it,

56
00:03:37.801 --> 00:03:40.980
take it, Hey and hand them some stupid, you know,

57
00:03:41.130 --> 00:03:43.500
fake certificate of authenticity. Because again,

58
00:03:43.710 --> 00:03:46.170
this is not like from the president, right?

59
00:03:46.380 --> 00:03:50.730
They just literally have Donald Trump on their little thing that they send with

60
00:03:50.731 --> 00:03:55.440
it. And it says 45th president of the United States, which sure is true.

61
00:03:55.590 --> 00:03:59.490
But it, it implies that this is like some presidential bill,

62
00:03:59.550 --> 00:04:03.360
which it's not. And so I wondered how much that had to do with it.

63
00:04:03.510 --> 00:04:07.140
So I decided to call around instead and kind of remove that personal element,

64
00:04:07.141 --> 00:04:11.850
remove this from the equation as like a way to persuade them and

65
00:04:11.851 --> 00:04:15.420
really just make it about, you know, does it make sense to accept a space force,

66
00:04:15.780 --> 00:04:20.520
$2 bill? Do you guys accept, uh, the new space force,

67
00:04:20.880 --> 00:04:21.713
$2 bill.

68
00:04:22.290 --> 00:04:25.230
<v 2>And then the currency that is usually tendered, right?</v>

69
00:04:25.470 --> 00:04:30.390
<v 0>Yeah. But it's got it's the new space force, like kind of logo.</v>

70
00:04:30.391 --> 00:04:34.350
I know some people accept it. Some people don't like Donald Trump,

71
00:04:35.430 --> 00:04:39.870
I think probably would accept it. But, um, given that there's, you know,

72
00:04:39.871 --> 00:04:44.160
the new presidency, that's all been kind of called into question, you know, the,

73
00:04:44.161 --> 00:04:46.350
you know, I don't know if Joe.

74
00:04:46.560 --> 00:04:48.960
<v 2>All right, give me one moment. Let me, okay. Cool.</v>

75
00:04:50.550 --> 00:04:51.840
You said it's space force.

76
00:04:52.380 --> 00:04:56.460
<v 0>Yeah. It's the new space force. $2 bill it's printed by the Merrick mint.</v>

77
00:04:56.610 --> 00:04:59.730
They're a private mint. Like, like I think if Trump got elected again,

78
00:04:59.731 --> 00:05:03.090
it'd probably be legal Tinder, but now I'm not so sure with Joe Biden's,

79
00:05:03.100 --> 00:05:05.580
I'm trying to spend, I spent a lot of money on these $2 bills.

80
00:05:05.730 --> 00:05:06.840
Cause I thought they might be worth something,

81
00:05:06.841 --> 00:05:10.620
but now I'm trying to spend them before Biden gets into office.

82
00:05:10.621 --> 00:05:13.290
You know how he is with like China and you know, you're paying him.

83
00:05:14.100 --> 00:05:16.470
<v 2>I get you. I'm just trying to figure out if we accept it.</v>

84
00:05:17.130 --> 00:05:20.370
<v 0>You should see it. They've got like a, they've got like a spaceship on it.</v>

85
00:05:20.371 --> 00:05:24.330
They've got like a rocket going to the moon. Um, it's a pretty cool bill.

86
00:05:24.331 --> 00:05:27.540
I think think pizza hut would be happy to happy to.

87
00:05:28.200 --> 00:05:31.310
<v 2>All right. So she's saying we only accept the regular recognize though.</v>

88
00:05:31.410 --> 00:05:35.070
<v 0>You do not accept the United States space force $2 bill.</v>

89
00:05:36.030 --> 00:05:39.090
<v 2>She, what she said to me is the killer recognized,</v>

90
00:05:39.091 --> 00:05:42.690
but what I'm trying to explain to her, what it is say has a spaceship on it.

91
00:05:43.710 --> 00:05:47.610
<v 0>On it. It's uh, it's got a satellite. Uh,</v>

92
00:05:47.910 --> 00:05:49.680
I don't know how else to describe it.

93
00:05:49.740 --> 00:05:53.850
As long as pizza hut bent it probably before Joe Biden got into office,

94
00:05:53.851 --> 00:05:57.560
I think it'd probably be fine, but, um, I am a little bit worried that this,

95
00:05:57.561 --> 00:06:00.590
this currency will be useless after, you know,

96
00:06:01.300 --> 00:06:03.860
the socialist gets in the white house. I'm a little bit worried about.

97
00:06:03.880 --> 00:06:08.440
<v 2>So what I do suggest though you can,</v>

98
00:06:08.441 --> 00:06:11.890
when you get to the store, see if they accepted at the store.

99
00:06:12.220 --> 00:06:14.890
<v 0>But you're saying that they probably won't though, is what you're saying.</v>

100
00:06:15.040 --> 00:06:17.890
Cause I don't want to drive down there with all my I've got like a duffel bag of

101
00:06:17.891 --> 00:06:18.724
space.

102
00:06:19.390 --> 00:06:22.750
<v 2>What accepted and there shouldn't be a reason why they would not accept it</v>

103
00:06:22.751 --> 00:06:26.530
because if it's printed to be used in the country, then.

104
00:06:27.160 --> 00:06:29.410
<v 0>Patriotic to not, not take it. Right.</v>

105
00:06:29.590 --> 00:06:31.720
Like I feel like that would be almost unpatriotic.

106
00:06:31.960 --> 00:06:33.430
It is a United States space force.

107
00:06:33.460 --> 00:06:35.860
Unless like the name has changed from the space force.

108
00:06:36.190 --> 00:06:41.080
<v 2>I wouldn't say it's a part of patriotic or not it's whether or not</v>

109
00:06:41.081 --> 00:06:44.710
they bashed us because it, the knowledge isn't there.

110
00:06:45.160 --> 00:06:47.650
Then the utterance is going to be there as well.

111
00:06:48.490 --> 00:06:51.400
<v 0>Right? Yeah. The ignorance is there. I think they wouldn't take it, but well,</v>

112
00:06:51.401 --> 00:06:53.650
okay. I'll drive right into the store. I mean,

113
00:06:53.950 --> 00:06:56.920
if that's what it takes to get this, this space for us dollars off my hands.

114
00:06:58.540 --> 00:07:01.900
Okay, great. Thank you. Alrighty. Thank you. Bye. All right.

115
00:07:01.901 --> 00:07:03.760
So this is going to be a bit of a different test guys.

116
00:07:03.890 --> 00:07:08.110
This is going to be a Starbucks chat thing because so far we've gone in person.

117
00:07:08.230 --> 00:07:10.840
We got them. We called pizza hut. We got them.

118
00:07:11.200 --> 00:07:15.070
Now I want to know will Starbucks do it? So I'm asking them a question.

119
00:07:15.071 --> 00:07:19.570
Starbucks accepting space force. $2 bill. Question of patriotism.

120
00:07:19.600 --> 00:07:24.130
First name Ben, last name, Dover. It looks like we got dagger. Okay.

121
00:07:24.160 --> 00:07:24.821
Hi dagger.

122
00:07:24.821 --> 00:07:29.800
D does Starbucks currently accept space

123
00:07:32.080 --> 00:07:32.350
$4?

124
00:07:32.350 --> 00:07:36.520
Maybe we should attach like a picture of the space force dollar I've attached to

125
00:07:36.521 --> 00:07:39.280
the currency. In question, I heard you guys were having a war with Christmas,

126
00:07:39.281 --> 00:07:42.790
but I'm sure Howard feels differently about space force. Then I appreciate that.

127
00:07:42.791 --> 00:07:46.090
You're trying to confirm if we accept space force $2,

128
00:07:46.750 --> 00:07:48.730
I'm going to start attaching more files.

129
00:07:50.830 --> 00:07:53.410
Should I hit them with the certificate of authority? No.

130
00:07:53.411 --> 00:07:57.190
One's been able to resist the certificate of authority guys.

131
00:07:57.940 --> 00:07:59.890
I don't have that information available,

132
00:07:59.891 --> 00:08:02.860
but I will be happy to find any updates for you. Well,

133
00:08:02.861 --> 00:08:07.150
it seems like a simple question of patriotism.

134
00:08:07.151 --> 00:08:08.650
To be honest,

135
00:08:09.100 --> 00:08:13.780
I understand that the socialists think Donny,

136
00:08:13.930 --> 00:08:18.220
I sound so unhinged right now. Donny is out of office,

137
00:08:18.250 --> 00:08:19.870
but we've got,

138
00:08:23.140 --> 00:08:27.760
I think space force bills should be allowed through.

139
00:08:27.790 --> 00:08:28.900
Let's pull him into this.

140
00:08:29.140 --> 00:08:33.820
I think space force bills should be allowed who at least the end of

141
00:08:33.940 --> 00:08:36.700
Donald's presidency, don't you.

142
00:08:36.850 --> 00:08:41.260
And then let's hit them with the certificate of authenticity. Here we go.

143
00:08:41.261 --> 00:08:44.950
We hit them with the certificate of authenticity. At this time.

144
00:08:44.951 --> 00:08:48.310
What I can do is share your thoughts with the team in charged useless.

145
00:08:48.370 --> 00:08:52.840
Also I would invite you to post your idea@ideasdotstarbucks.com.

146
00:08:52.870 --> 00:08:54.910
Most of the ideas posted here I've already come to.

147
00:08:56.340 --> 00:08:58.890
I'm not suggesting anything though.

148
00:08:58.920 --> 00:09:03.630
Simply ask if I bring in my $2 base for

149
00:09:03.631 --> 00:09:08.100
spill, if they will give me my grand day,

150
00:09:08.430 --> 00:09:11.010
you're more than welcome to try Ben. At this time,

151
00:09:11.040 --> 00:09:15.480
there is no restriction are any updates about accepting this type of current

152
00:09:15.840 --> 00:09:16.080
sank?

153
00:09:16.080 --> 00:09:21.000
You dagger D I will be sure to note among my

154
00:09:21.240 --> 00:09:22.530
fellow Patriots,

155
00:09:22.560 --> 00:09:26.850
that Starbucks hasn't sold out to China just yet.

156
00:09:27.390 --> 00:09:32.250
So to recap, I think Starbucks was probably the worst least likely to accept,

157
00:09:32.520 --> 00:09:35.880
but in this case, I guess least likely to accept does not necessarily mean bad.

158
00:09:35.881 --> 00:09:40.740
Maybe more like diligent. Wow. So this is a weird twist.

159
00:09:40.741 --> 00:09:44.460
I was about to finish this video and I teased it on social media and somebody

160
00:09:44.640 --> 00:09:47.970
from within the business reached out to me saying that they'd love to share some

161
00:09:48.570 --> 00:09:50.580
insider tips. So this is my call with him.

162
00:09:50.581 --> 00:09:52.230
We learned how much money they're making.

163
00:09:52.410 --> 00:09:55.770
Here's that talk as a little capstone to this goofy video.

164
00:09:56.070 --> 00:09:58.440
Do you see that you guys.

165
00:09:59.090 --> 00:10:02.210
<v 3>Yup. We made that ad. That's what? A hundred percent we at the,</v>

166
00:10:02.211 --> 00:10:06.620
I have like the made-up like screenshots of the cutouts of Trump that I have is

167
00:10:06.621 --> 00:10:07.760
like hilarious.

168
00:10:07.880 --> 00:10:10.250
<v 0>So how much money are you making with this? I mean, I I've got,</v>

169
00:10:10.350 --> 00:10:14.420
I never fall for ads. I understand.

170
00:10:14.450 --> 00:10:16.550
You got to understand you're the first person who got me.

171
00:10:16.730 --> 00:10:19.370
I had never fought for this stuff. I saw it. I said, it's too good.

172
00:10:19.371 --> 00:10:24.260
They win the marketers finally win. How so? Yeah. What are we talking about?

173
00:10:24.261 --> 00:10:25.094
Here?

174
00:10:25.820 --> 00:10:30.260
<v 3>There you go. It is good. So like, so the cost of goods for that bill.</v>

175
00:10:30.261 --> 00:10:33.320
So for us to get the bill, package it,

176
00:10:33.321 --> 00:10:38.300
ship it out to you like that dollars a specific bill, um, for,

177
00:10:38.960 --> 00:10:43.310
um, for us in particular, it's in the $7 range. So for others,

178
00:10:44.450 --> 00:10:48.650
it could be anywhere from like nine 12, or like whatever,

179
00:10:48.651 --> 00:10:50.240
like relationship you have with the manufacturer.

180
00:10:50.241 --> 00:10:54.590
But if you buy it directly from them directly, they'll sell it to you for about,

181
00:10:54.650 --> 00:10:58.360
think about 15 bucks. Oh,

182
00:10:58.530 --> 00:11:02.300
but you guys have a wholesale deal. They're actually just drop shipping.

183
00:11:02.450 --> 00:11:05.720
So we're shipping directly from the manufacturer. So it's not even wholesale.

184
00:11:05.870 --> 00:11:07.850
Dang it. I've been telling people, drop shipping doesn't work.

185
00:11:08.060 --> 00:11:08.893
<v 1>Okay.</v>

186
00:11:12.680 --> 00:11:14.600
<v 0>How much you make it with this business here, Brian.</v>

187
00:11:15.080 --> 00:11:17.570
<v 3>So like, just to make it clear, I'm an employee of the business.</v>

188
00:11:17.930 --> 00:11:22.100
We're hitting the thought about like 7.5 mil. Yeah.

189
00:11:22.220 --> 00:11:23.053
<v 1>Revenue.</v>

190
00:11:26.660 --> 00:11:30.200
<v 0>Hang on Brian. That can't all be profit, but I do know a large,</v>

191
00:11:30.230 --> 00:11:32.510
maybe larger profit margin than people think,

192
00:11:32.630 --> 00:11:35.300
because if you're getting it for seven bucks, it is, it's pretty high margin.

193
00:11:35.420 --> 00:11:38.240
You guys charged me a freaking grip for this. I've been salted.

194
00:11:38.930 --> 00:11:40.880
I had to pay like 20 bucks for that.

195
00:11:40.910 --> 00:11:42.530
But obviously this has to be your best year.

196
00:11:42.590 --> 00:11:46.250
It being the election and everything. And does it kind of dry up after this,

197
00:11:46.251 --> 00:11:49.190
I guess, or do you switch to selling Biden merchant? I mean,

198
00:11:49.191 --> 00:11:50.600
does Biden March sell? I don't know.

199
00:11:50.800 --> 00:11:55.360
<v 3>So what's funny is that we selling like left leaning stuff</v>

200
00:11:55.630 --> 00:11:59.950
multiple times and it flops like my boss when he was on eight did for Haley

201
00:11:59.980 --> 00:12:00.850
completely flopped.

202
00:12:00.880 --> 00:12:05.380
They'll give her two smacks about like Hillary or like Democrat party, whatever.

203
00:12:05.500 --> 00:12:10.330
But the minute we go conservative, it just, they just throw money at it.

204
00:12:10.331 --> 00:12:15.040
It's wild, like for the Biden. And um,

205
00:12:15.490 --> 00:12:18.280
like we have our own bills. We try, you know,

206
00:12:18.340 --> 00:12:21.280
putting it through Facebook ads is just a complete waste of money, you know?

207
00:12:21.340 --> 00:12:22.390
We're like, all right, we tried.

208
00:12:23.190 --> 00:12:26.830
<v 0>Just that it's Trump or is it that it's like cleaning right-leaning thing?</v>

209
00:12:27.570 --> 00:12:30.360
<v 3>I honestly, I think it's just like a, more of like a,</v>

210
00:12:31.440 --> 00:12:34.920
I think just when it comes to online and selling, I think it's just like, like,

211
00:12:35.100 --> 00:12:38.100
uh, like conservatives just in general,

212
00:12:38.101 --> 00:12:40.470
like I just assume they just have more money and, and like,

213
00:12:40.471 --> 00:12:43.620
they're more passionate about not like Trump and like,

214
00:12:43.890 --> 00:12:45.300
and like in their beliefs. So like,

215
00:12:45.390 --> 00:12:48.480
it's really easy to sell that Patriot TISM to them.

216
00:12:49.590 --> 00:12:53.460
Our next hottest drop is Trump's still our president and that's our way to bill

217
00:12:53.461 --> 00:12:56.610
like him like fighting back. So he's like still our president.

218
00:12:57.600 --> 00:13:01.150
Oh my God. Yeah. Hold on. I'll show you. Okay. It's okay.

219
00:13:01.410 --> 00:13:04.650
<v 0>Oh my gosh, dude. These are outrageous.</v>

220
00:13:05.850 --> 00:13:09.660
These are outrageous. All right, man. Well, uh,

221
00:13:09.690 --> 00:13:13.620
I'm going to leave it at that this video is not sponsored, so not sponsored,

222
00:13:14.160 --> 00:13:18.120
so I don't want to do a whole pitch fast, but uh, it's uh,

223
00:13:19.070 --> 00:13:20.160
think you'll forgive guys.
