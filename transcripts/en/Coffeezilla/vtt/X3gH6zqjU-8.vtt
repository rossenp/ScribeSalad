00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:02.700
<v 0>You know, honestly, I wish people would just ask me, Hey Steven,</v>

2
00:00:02.790 --> 00:00:04.230
is this a good idea?

3
00:00:04.290 --> 00:00:08.310
I'm about to sell out my entire brand for a few thousand dollars,

4
00:00:08.311 --> 00:00:11.460
maybe even a few million dollars. Is this a good idea? And I would tell them,

5
00:00:11.940 --> 00:00:14.580
uh, no terrible idea,

6
00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:17.340
such as the case with Kevin O'Leary,

7
00:00:17.370 --> 00:00:21.270
who has become a national embarrassment recently. And let me also say,

8
00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:24.180
I understand that becoming a national embarrassment is hard to do.

9
00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:27.900
Like most of us, we could never be national embarrassment at best.

10
00:00:27.901 --> 00:00:30.780
I'm a local embarrassment to my mother, the friends who know me,

11
00:00:30.781 --> 00:00:32.430
it's hard to be a national embarrassment.

12
00:00:32.431 --> 00:00:34.530
You already have to be nationally known.

13
00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:36.330
And so most people we don't even qualify,

14
00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:41.250
but Kevin O'Leary definitely is in the running because he's already a massive

15
00:00:41.251 --> 00:00:44.160
star. Thanks to shark tank. You guys know the show, right?

16
00:00:44.580 --> 00:00:48.240
It's like the WWE of venture capitalism. People hate this.

17
00:00:50.330 --> 00:00:51.163
<v 1>I hate it too.</v>

18
00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:56.210
<v 0>No investor comes on, pours out his life's work. And this is a bad idea.</v>

19
00:00:56.630 --> 00:00:57.441
They're always like, yeah.

20
00:00:57.441 --> 00:01:00.380
I want like a hundred percent of your equity for $5,000.

21
00:01:00.530 --> 00:01:03.920
<v 1>Here's my offer for 100% of rock block.</v>

22
00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:07.730
<v 0>And that's the show and it's fun. It's hilarious.</v>

23
00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:12.290
But one of the things that annoys me is the way that these sharks have been

24
00:01:12.380 --> 00:01:15.860
selling out their reputations. Maybe, cause they're not getting paid enough.

25
00:01:15.890 --> 00:01:18.050
Maybe they need a bigger yacht. Maybe they need a bigger house.

26
00:01:18.051 --> 00:01:21.290
I don't know what it is. But now that they're all massive celebrities,

27
00:01:21.291 --> 00:01:25.670
they've been selling out their image and moving totally away from this idea that

28
00:01:25.671 --> 00:01:27.110
they had when they were sharks like, Oh,

29
00:01:27.111 --> 00:01:30.920
we're no nonsense business guys into selling out their brand to the highest

30
00:01:30.921 --> 00:01:34.000
bidder, no matter how scrupulous or unscrupulous they weren't.

31
00:01:34.001 --> 00:01:37.820
We already covered Robert Herjavec who was caught in a little real estate

32
00:01:37.821 --> 00:01:42.230
scheme. But you should also know other sharks are also doing this Damon, John,

33
00:01:42.740 --> 00:01:46.880
uh, also endorsed Jason Bond picks, which if you guys know stocks,

34
00:01:46.881 --> 00:01:51.530
you know what a joke that guy is. All right, listen, before I contacted Jason,

35
00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:54.110
I'm a shark, right? You know, I have no problem about, you know,

36
00:01:54.111 --> 00:01:58.160
ripping somebody apart or just saying I'm out. No, you're a sellout for money.

37
00:01:58.220 --> 00:01:58.491
You know,

38
00:01:58.491 --> 00:02:01.220
instead of having to go to the office every day and talking to a full staff or

39
00:02:01.400 --> 00:02:04.250
worried about who buys this shirt or what new company I invest in,

40
00:02:04.490 --> 00:02:08.210
I'm going to be sitting on my yard. Great. Well guys, it's that easy.

41
00:02:08.211 --> 00:02:11.270
Just forget about a business trade from your guy.

42
00:02:11.780 --> 00:02:16.430
So that's a massive L right there, but nothing is worse at all.

43
00:02:16.490 --> 00:02:19.610
Pales in comparison to what I'm about to show you guys today because Kevin

44
00:02:19.611 --> 00:02:24.560
O'Leary has taken sellout to the extreme and gotten himself on

45
00:02:24.561 --> 00:02:26.840
cameo. Now guys, if you don't know what cameo is,

46
00:02:26.841 --> 00:02:30.170
it's like a place where you can get birthday shout outs from the boy band,

47
00:02:30.171 --> 00:02:33.140
from the nineties that you used to like, and your friend still likes them.

48
00:02:33.141 --> 00:02:37.520
So you get them best wishes for a birthday or whatever on cameo for like 90

49
00:02:37.521 --> 00:02:40.700
bucks. Okay. That's what you're supposed to do on cameo.

50
00:02:40.701 --> 00:02:42.950
If you have an ounce left of self-respect,

51
00:02:43.220 --> 00:02:48.200
what Kevin O'Leary is doing on cameo is charging $1,200 for business

52
00:02:48.980 --> 00:02:51.260
outs for any business that you want.

53
00:02:52.180 --> 00:02:54.470
<v 1>Hey everybody, Mr. Wonderful here. Hey Mr. Wonderful here.</v>

54
00:02:54.650 --> 00:02:57.170
Hey Mr. Wonderful from shark tank here, busy kid.

55
00:02:57.470 --> 00:03:01.120
And that's what training was all about. Millcroft lawn care pro Nossa.

56
00:03:01.750 --> 00:03:04.600
It's a website that personalizes and helps you grow your business.

57
00:03:04.660 --> 00:03:08.380
It's the only app where your kids can track their chores. You know, look,

www Burlington lawn care.com. Now,

60
00:03:14.681 --> 00:03:17.650
if you're a plastic surgeon, you're going to want to hear me on this thing.

61
00:03:18.220 --> 00:03:22.360
I'm shouting out for service called plastic surgeon at experts.

62
00:03:22.780 --> 00:03:23.620
It's been, you know.

63
00:03:24.270 --> 00:03:25.103
<v 0>What?</v>

64
00:03:25.380 --> 00:03:29.880
You're shouting out for plastic surgeon at hu uh,

65
00:03:29.940 --> 00:03:32.580
Kevin, what do you know about these guys?

66
00:03:32.730 --> 00:03:34.860
Besides the script they gave you to read?

67
00:03:35.190 --> 00:03:38.580
<v 1>You have to generate leads. You want to do that efficiently, productively,</v>

68
00:03:38.850 --> 00:03:42.630
and you want your customer acquisition costs to be as efficient as possible.

69
00:03:42.840 --> 00:03:46.920
And that's exactly exactly what surgeon addicts parts do.

70
00:03:47.040 --> 00:03:51.570
So check out plastic surgeon ad experts because they're

71
00:03:51.571 --> 00:03:55.290
focused on your vertical. If you're a plastic surgeon, check it out.

72
00:03:55.860 --> 00:04:00.240
<v 0>I mean, am I crazy here? This is, this is embarrassing.</v>

73
00:04:00.600 --> 00:04:04.590
Like he doesn't even disclose the fact that he's being paid to do this, right?

74
00:04:04.591 --> 00:04:07.770
Like if I ha if I'm shouting out, I don't know,

75
00:04:08.580 --> 00:04:12.570
blue moon to use a offhand example. I have to tell you,

76
00:04:12.571 --> 00:04:14.670
I'm sponsored by blue moon. I'm not going to say, Hey,

77
00:04:14.671 --> 00:04:17.940
I'm doing a shout out for my friends over at blue moon. Uh,

78
00:04:17.970 --> 00:04:21.600
they're not my friends. They're paying me to say this and look,

79
00:04:21.990 --> 00:04:22.823
it goes on and on.

80
00:04:23.670 --> 00:04:24.750
<v 1>Hey Mr. Wonderful here.</v>

81
00:04:25.170 --> 00:04:28.230
And one of the things that everybody's thinking about is can I get a.

82
00:04:29.160 --> 00:04:33.720
<v 0>How are you shouting out now? Come on, Kevin, tell us who I'm doing.</v>

83
00:04:33.720 --> 00:04:36.060
<v 1>One for side hustle app.</v>

84
00:04:36.600 --> 00:04:40.620
<v 0>Oh great side hustle app. Paid them to do this. And why would he do this? Right?</v>

85
00:04:40.650 --> 00:04:44.040
Why, why would people pay so much money for this? Cause $1,200 is a lot.

86
00:04:44.250 --> 00:04:45.990
If you're just going to keep this cameo to yourself.

87
00:04:46.140 --> 00:04:47.370
Cause that's what cameos are meant to do,

88
00:04:47.400 --> 00:04:50.550
but that's not how people are using Kevin O'Leary's shout outs.

89
00:04:50.580 --> 00:04:55.230
And he knows that they use them to endorse their own business. Look at this.

90
00:04:55.770 --> 00:04:59.790
Each trio gets a shout out from Mr. Wonderful shark. Tank's most beloved.

91
00:04:59.791 --> 00:05:03.420
Kevin O'Leary gives a big shout out to Samantha, yell at him at Chile.

92
00:05:05.190 --> 00:05:06.090
Okay. Check it out.

93
00:05:06.630 --> 00:05:11.160
<v 1>I missed a wonderful here and I love to celebrate entrepreneurship and I mean</v>

94
00:05:11.161 --> 00:05:13.710
globally. So here's a really interesting shout out.

95
00:05:14.130 --> 00:05:16.980
<v 0>Hey buddy, you're not doing a shout out.</v>

96
00:05:17.100 --> 00:05:22.080
You are doing thousands of sponsorship posts and selling

97
00:05:22.081 --> 00:05:26.670
out your brand to trick consumers. Let's be clear about what you're doing.

98
00:05:26.671 --> 00:05:30.300
It's not a, he like how he does that. Like, Oh, it's a great shout out.

99
00:05:30.301 --> 00:05:33.840
Interesting. Shout out I have going on here. Not what you're doing, buddy.

100
00:05:34.170 --> 00:05:35.880
<v 1>Here's a really interesting shout.</v>

101
00:05:35.880 --> 00:05:36.960
<v 0>Out. Look at this.</v>

102
00:05:37.110 --> 00:05:41.910
Kevin L they spelled his name wrong literally of shark tank endorses.

103
00:05:42.180 --> 00:05:46.590
He trio and look, why wouldn't they say that they paid $1,200 to say that.

104
00:05:46.860 --> 00:05:49.320
And Kevin knows. They paid to say that.

105
00:05:49.350 --> 00:05:52.260
I can't even tell you how many people lately I've seen do this,

106
00:05:52.261 --> 00:05:55.500
where they get Kevin alert specifically. He's like the King of this,

107
00:05:55.950 --> 00:05:58.280
of these fake shout. I'm Mr. Wonderful.

108
00:05:58.280 --> 00:06:02.240
<v 1>From shark tank here has sold nearly a thousand different products on Amazon</v>

109
00:06:02.241 --> 00:06:06.920
alone. Check out Sophie's book. Thank you for the kind words,

110
00:06:06.921 --> 00:06:07.754
Kevin.

111
00:06:07.810 --> 00:06:11.560
<v 0>There it is. You can pretend like the endorsement was all natural.</v>

112
00:06:12.220 --> 00:06:13.720
What I paid for it? What do you mean?

113
00:06:13.721 --> 00:06:16.630
This is just what Kevin O'Leary me and Kevin O'Leary. We're just tight.

114
00:06:16.631 --> 00:06:20.980
Like this we're just tight like this because he never says it's a sponsorship.

115
00:06:21.220 --> 00:06:23.230
He just says it's a shout out. So you can do it.

116
00:06:23.231 --> 00:06:27.100
This lady's doing and put it in your YouTube ad. Oh yes, dude.

117
00:06:27.101 --> 00:06:32.020
He has sold out the soul of this show and just been like, Hey,

118
00:06:32.530 --> 00:06:35.170
you know, it stood for real people,

119
00:06:35.171 --> 00:06:38.350
making real companies forget all that I'll sell you.

120
00:06:39.130 --> 00:06:42.460
I'll say you a shout out for $1,200. You'd get at me and look, he's done a,

121
00:06:42.461 --> 00:06:46.960
he's got 157 reviews on here. And if you think that, you know,

122
00:06:47.020 --> 00:06:50.740
on average, probably one in 10 people review a product,

123
00:06:50.860 --> 00:06:55.120
we can actually find out how much he's made from this whole a sellout. Right?

124
00:06:55.990 --> 00:06:58.330
So if a one out of 10 people actually reviewed it,

125
00:06:58.331 --> 00:07:03.190
then when you have a 1500 people who actually bought it $1,200 a pop

126
00:07:03.670 --> 00:07:08.290
Kevin O'Leary's made $2 million from his quick little sell out there.

127
00:07:08.530 --> 00:07:12.550
And in honestly I do get the hustle. Listen, what I am going to say though,

128
00:07:12.551 --> 00:07:16.480
is you have to accept the responsibility for what you do. So if you,

129
00:07:16.481 --> 00:07:19.660
if all you want to do is shout outs on cameo. Okay?

130
00:07:20.080 --> 00:07:24.250
But then you can't pretend to be the investor that we're all supposed to take.

131
00:07:24.251 --> 00:07:27.790
Seriously. You can't be the guy whose word we're supposed to be like, Oh,

132
00:07:27.791 --> 00:07:29.980
if he endorses that product, it's a big deal, dude.

133
00:07:29.981 --> 00:07:34.180
This guy will endorse human poop. If it paid him $1,200.

134
00:07:34.570 --> 00:07:37.780
And I'm not sure that that's an exaggeration,

135
00:07:37.781 --> 00:07:41.980
even because Kevin has endorsed some doozies, dude, check this out.

136
00:07:41.981 --> 00:07:46.420
This is done for you agency launch already. We see kind of Kevin over there.

137
00:07:46.421 --> 00:07:49.660
We'll get to him in a second. But look at this guy, okay.

138
00:07:49.870 --> 00:07:52.780
This guy is some 25 year old, nothing. And look at this picture, right?

139
00:07:53.410 --> 00:07:56.830
Look at this picture that he's got right here. Now, do you know anything,

140
00:07:56.860 --> 00:07:58.570
notice anything funny about this picture?

141
00:07:58.600 --> 00:08:01.540
Like he's clearly talking to some interviewer or something like that.

142
00:08:01.541 --> 00:08:04.060
Here's the laundry Brunner. Oh sure. He's wearing AirPods.

143
00:08:04.061 --> 00:08:06.490
That's a little bit weird. Right? But I'm not going to hate on him for that.

144
00:08:07.390 --> 00:08:12.160
But look over right. Wait, sorry.

145
00:08:12.161 --> 00:08:16.600
I can't see properly. Uh, right here. See something wrong with that bookshelf.

146
00:08:18.250 --> 00:08:22.960
This is a entrepreneur who has green screened himself

147
00:08:22.990 --> 00:08:26.620
into a fake interview. First fake social clout.

148
00:08:26.650 --> 00:08:31.120
This is a lie. It is a green screen set. Now listen,

149
00:08:31.121 --> 00:08:33.640
am I going to judge someone with the green screen set?

150
00:08:35.320 --> 00:08:39.820
You're right. I, well dude, you can't trust someone with the green screen set.

151
00:08:39.821 --> 00:08:40.930
Let me be the first to say it.

152
00:08:41.170 --> 00:08:45.970
And yet we have Mr. Sellout here who

153
00:08:45.971 --> 00:08:50.530
approves the whole thing. Andrew poppy out is Mr. Wonderful unpro.

154
00:08:51.220 --> 00:08:54.610
<v 1>You know, was an incredibly powerful force if you know how to harness it.</v>

155
00:08:54.910 --> 00:08:58.110
So I'm doing a shout out for Andrew. Padea interesting entrepreneurial.

156
00:08:58.670 --> 00:08:59.540
<v 2>Oh.</v>

157
00:09:01.340 --> 00:09:02.450
<v 0>Very interesting. Entrepreneur.</v>

158
00:09:02.451 --> 00:09:05.330
Don't you think Kevin probably done a lot of research into Andrew Bobby.

159
00:09:05.600 --> 00:09:06.530
D's done that due diligence.

160
00:09:06.531 --> 00:09:10.610
He's done the due diligence of the done for you agency launches five-year plan,

161
00:09:10.611 --> 00:09:13.760
right? Oh yeah. Very interesting entrepreneur. Very interesting.

162
00:09:13.880 --> 00:09:16.520
<v 1>Of course digitally. This is when he's 21 years old,</v>

163
00:09:16.700 --> 00:09:21.460
Jim leads fast and he's become almost a consultant to those that use digital

164
00:09:21.920 --> 00:09:22.753
platforms.

165
00:09:24.140 --> 00:09:27.590
<v 2>He's almost become a consultant, dude. You're reading off a teleprompter.</v>

166
00:09:27.591 --> 00:09:31.130
Kevin it's enough. This is embarrassing.

167
00:09:31.400 --> 00:09:35.990
<v 0>Stop it. Stop it. Like at some point you have sold out too much,</v>

168
00:09:36.290 --> 00:09:39.980
right? Like don't pretend you know, all this guy's history.

169
00:09:40.070 --> 00:09:44.570
He's given you a script to read for $1,200. Let's be clear with the consumer.

170
00:09:44.571 --> 00:09:48.980
What this is. Why should we respect these celebrity entrepreneurs?

171
00:09:49.190 --> 00:09:53.870
If they're going to turn around and sell out their image for nothing for 1200

172
00:09:53.871 --> 00:09:56.780
bucks, dude, I can't imagine. Listen, I get that.

173
00:09:56.781 --> 00:10:01.310
He's making tons of money and God bless him for it. But for me,

174
00:10:01.490 --> 00:10:03.830
it's kind of, it kind of ruined shark tank.

175
00:10:03.860 --> 00:10:06.530
When I see all the entrepreneurs on shark tank,

176
00:10:06.830 --> 00:10:09.770
selling out their brand for nothing. I don't know.

177
00:10:09.980 --> 00:10:13.250
I want to hear what you guys think. Am I exaggerating things? I,

178
00:10:13.390 --> 00:10:18.260
I honestly do think Kevin O'Leary for this for selling out his name this many

179
00:10:18.261 --> 00:10:21.980
times that's this is national embarrassment territory. Like I said,

180
00:10:21.981 --> 00:10:24.890
I know it's a stretch. I know it's a high bar.

181
00:10:24.950 --> 00:10:29.180
Not many people have reached the Pantheon of national embarrassment.

182
00:10:29.181 --> 00:10:33.290
Most people have only reached the state level or the local level or the

183
00:10:33.860 --> 00:10:38.450
council, the city council level. But Kevin O'Leary, I think in my opinion,

184
00:10:38.451 --> 00:10:40.580
he's gone all the way to the Tiffany Tiffany top.

185
00:10:41.210 --> 00:10:44.510
We know what you guys think in the comments below and just remember guys,

186
00:10:44.570 --> 00:10:47.240
you can't believe everything you see on the internet.
