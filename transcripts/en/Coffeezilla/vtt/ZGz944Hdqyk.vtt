1
00:00:00.360 --> 00:00:04.230
<v 0>Let me just ask you, what, what do you think makes you guys different? I mean,</v>

2
00:00:04.231 --> 00:00:06.420
there's just so many services out there.

3
00:00:06.660 --> 00:00:10.530
Aging bull really is the best place you can go to learn about trading stocks.

4
00:00:10.590 --> 00:00:15.300
These are actual guys who are in the markets trading every day. I,

5
00:00:15.301 --> 00:00:18.480
yes, the beautiful power of hindsight, ladies and gentlemen,

6
00:00:18.780 --> 00:00:22.890
we're about to take a look at the millionaire roadmap of Miami mastermind.

7
00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:24.360
A little add back in the day.

8
00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:29.190
Cause I want to set up the whole stage for you because we're going to get into

9
00:00:29.191 --> 00:00:33.330
the gigantic lawsuit that just came crashing down on raging bull.

10
00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:36.330
But before that, let's see what they were advertising ladies and gentlemen,

11
00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:38.880
let's see what they were talking about. What all the buzz was about.

12
00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:42.060
Raging bull is a couple of educators.

13
00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:46.830
So-called educators that are going to teach you how to trade stocks, guys,

14
00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:48.810
how to trade penny stocks, how to trade options.

15
00:00:49.430 --> 00:00:52.070
<v 1>But I can tell you this much and you don't take that bait.</v>

16
00:00:52.340 --> 00:00:53.360
It's not going to happen.

17
00:00:53.630 --> 00:00:57.440
<v 0>This is Jason Bond. He says he's a, he's a former teach,</v>

18
00:00:57.740 --> 00:00:58.700
but he quit all that.

19
00:00:58.701 --> 00:01:01.700
After he made tons of money in the stock market got himself out of debt.

20
00:01:01.820 --> 00:01:03.110
And now he's ready to teach you.

21
00:01:03.590 --> 00:01:05.210
<v 1>We're here to support you. Just.</v>

22
00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:10.700
<v 0>Jeff is the big heifer. He owns most of bull and he claims, Oh my gosh,</v>

23
00:01:11.720 --> 00:01:16.400
he's a genius guys. This man has a very high IQ. He's in Mensa.

24
00:01:16.401 --> 00:01:17.270
If you don't know what that is,

25
00:01:17.271 --> 00:01:21.500
it's a whole club for people who are obsessed with her IQ test scores and his

26
00:01:21.501 --> 00:01:25.820
pitch is that he also can make you wildly profitable in the stock market.

27
00:01:25.821 --> 00:01:30.010
Ladies and gentlemen, in fact, they were pitching something during COVID and he,

28
00:01:30.040 --> 00:01:30.890
they were saying, Hey,

29
00:01:31.370 --> 00:01:34.880
during COVID you can make those pandemic plays that are gonna make you a lot of

30
00:01:34.881 --> 00:01:36.770
money. That's what they call them pandemic plays.

31
00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:39.140
And we'll get into how that went in a second. But let's,

32
00:01:39.141 --> 00:01:40.130
let's finish this off real quick.

33
00:01:40.970 --> 00:01:45.590
<v 1>I taught all of that to Kyle he's made over $3 million. This is on the plane.</v>

34
00:01:45.800 --> 00:01:48.080
We are so proud of those accomplishments.

35
00:01:48.410 --> 00:01:50.930
We are going to make sure that we give you our best.

36
00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:54.620
Get in the millionaire roadmap. I want to see you on this jet with us next time.

37
00:01:54.650 --> 00:01:55.190
It's.

38
00:01:55.190 --> 00:01:57.470
<v 0>Hey, let's get on the jet boys. Awesome.</v>

39
00:01:57.800 --> 00:01:59.360
<v 1>And you can totally do it.</v>

40
00:01:59.930 --> 00:02:03.380
<v 0>Okay. So remember this freeze frame here,</v>

41
00:02:03.770 --> 00:02:08.120
the founders of a company called raging bull tout themselves as expert stock

42
00:02:08.121 --> 00:02:12.350
traders who teach customers, how they too can become millionaires.

43
00:02:13.190 --> 00:02:14.180
The millionaire roadmap,

44
00:02:14.900 --> 00:02:19.610
marketing emails said they found a hidden boom market in the COVID-19

45
00:02:19.611 --> 00:02:22.460
pandemic, federal regulators,

46
00:02:22.490 --> 00:02:25.490
AKA the federal trade commission save the company.

47
00:02:25.491 --> 00:02:29.030
Operators have defrauded customers out of more than

48
00:02:31.340 --> 00:02:33.110
$137 million over the past three years.

49
00:02:33.410 --> 00:02:35.900
And the Corona virus fueled economic crisis.

50
00:02:36.140 --> 00:02:40.130
Hasn't tempered their reckless efforts to dupe vulnerable investors.

51
00:02:42.860 --> 00:02:47.360
Gosh, to the girl, either being sued, uh, just came out today. The news,

52
00:02:47.840 --> 00:02:51.050
Holy crap, boys. This is a big one.

53
00:02:52.010 --> 00:02:56.570
And here's the big news, right? Because these guys, all these traders, a lot,

54
00:02:56.571 --> 00:02:57.740
most of their pitch, I mean,

55
00:02:57.741 --> 00:03:01.420
I would say a hundred percent of their is reliant on them being successful

56
00:03:01.421 --> 00:03:02.260
themselves, right?

57
00:03:02.261 --> 00:03:04.900
Because who would buy it from someone who's not a successful trader?

58
00:03:04.900 --> 00:03:07.000
So they all say I'm such a hot shot.

59
00:03:07.001 --> 00:03:10.330
I made $250,000 in six months or you know,

60
00:03:10.360 --> 00:03:13.840
$3 million in two years or whatever it is. They all tell you that.

61
00:03:13.841 --> 00:03:17.770
And they tell you, you can be like me. I have a proven path to success,

62
00:03:18.460 --> 00:03:21.640
but let's look at the truth. See the federal trade commission did some big,

63
00:03:22.090 --> 00:03:23.080
here's what they say.

64
00:03:23.440 --> 00:03:26.350
And one of my favorite sentences from the lawsuit Bishop has incurred.

65
00:03:26.351 --> 00:03:30.610
And this is Jeff Bishop, the genius Mensa guy. Oh, he's so smart.

66
00:03:31.150 --> 00:03:35.620
He incurred substantial and persistent losses as a result of his own stock and

67
00:03:35.621 --> 00:03:37.150
option trading activities.

68
00:03:38.370 --> 00:03:40.050
<v 2>He's a loser dude.</v>

69
00:03:41.040 --> 00:03:44.370
<v 0>Bishop's income is primarily derived from subscription fees.</v>

70
00:03:44.371 --> 00:03:47.340
Consumers pay to raging bull. I mean, you know, we know this.

71
00:03:47.970 --> 00:03:51.660
<v 2>But to hear the Popo say it, Oh,</v>

72
00:03:51.870 --> 00:03:53.070
it's so gratifying.

73
00:03:53.400 --> 00:03:57.000
<v 0>I just love hearing the federal trade commission hammering at home.</v>

74
00:03:57.630 --> 00:04:01.320
Because if I say it, guys, you know, they are going to call me libelous.

75
00:04:01.321 --> 00:04:03.240
They're going to try to go after me, but you can't get mad at me.

76
00:04:03.241 --> 00:04:07.290
I'm just reading off a lawsuit here. Don't get mad at me. Jason Bond,

77
00:04:07.291 --> 00:04:10.410
same thing, incurred, substantial and persistent losses. Guys.

78
00:04:10.560 --> 00:04:13.530
You're paying losers to teach you how to trade stocks.

79
00:04:13.790 --> 00:04:16.200
You're paying people who quote,

80
00:04:16.560 --> 00:04:20.610
incurred substantial and persistent losses as a result of his own stock and

81
00:04:20.640 --> 00:04:25.590
options, trading activities in quo. This whole idea of joining us on the jet.

82
00:04:25.680 --> 00:04:28.380
You guys can join me on the jet. Yeah.

83
00:04:28.440 --> 00:04:31.620
If you open your own raging bull.com and sell subscriptions,

84
00:04:31.830 --> 00:04:33.690
that's where the real money is in stock trading.

85
00:04:34.080 --> 00:04:37.020
It's in selling how to trade stocks, sorry, is the truth.

86
00:04:37.110 --> 00:04:40.260
And you're going to learn it. If you have to go through a course and learn it,

87
00:04:40.560 --> 00:04:43.680
or you can learn it the easy way and just, you know, hear what I'm saying.

88
00:04:43.710 --> 00:04:46.050
Look at the pattern of behavior. Look at history.

89
00:04:46.560 --> 00:04:50.010
This is where most of these guys who are not on wall street,

90
00:04:50.011 --> 00:04:53.250
who are unregistered, who are trying to sell you financial advice.

91
00:04:53.790 --> 00:04:57.060
This is where they're making their money with the jet ads, you know,

92
00:04:57.061 --> 00:05:00.120
with the hyper polished, Oh, I want to make you money.

93
00:05:00.390 --> 00:05:02.100
I want to see you on this with us. Next time.

94
00:05:02.790 --> 00:05:04.230
<v 2>I want to see you on the jet.</v>

95
00:05:10.440 --> 00:05:14.640
<v 0>Is what it is guys. It's my opinion. But here's the crazy thing. Okay?</v>

96
00:05:14.880 --> 00:05:15.900
Before this came out,

97
00:05:15.901 --> 00:05:19.710
you couldn't find hardly anything negative about these guys. Why?

98
00:05:19.950 --> 00:05:22.200
Because their endorsements were so huge.

99
00:05:22.230 --> 00:05:25.920
All the big people talking about them were all saying glowing reviews.

100
00:05:26.220 --> 00:05:28.170
But I don't know if you know this, but uh, Jordan Belfort,

101
00:05:28.171 --> 00:05:29.010
you know the sales guy,

102
00:05:29.011 --> 00:05:32.460
the guy who actually got convicted of fraud for stock stuff. Yeah.

103
00:05:32.490 --> 00:05:36.390
Actually he launched a product with them after getting out of jail. Okay.

104
00:05:36.420 --> 00:05:37.230
Get this.

105
00:05:37.230 --> 00:05:41.040
So he went to jail for getting in trouble with the penny stocks thing and

106
00:05:41.041 --> 00:05:45.150
investors and losing the money. He gets out of jail for that waits a few years.

107
00:05:45.151 --> 00:05:47.640
And then all of a sudden goes back with raging bull.

108
00:05:47.670 --> 00:05:50.430
Now I'm going to give him credit. It was a free product,

109
00:05:50.850 --> 00:05:52.890
but it was a trip wire product. Don't get it twisted.

110
00:05:52.891 --> 00:05:57.770
That was so you would buy more in to the 137 million fraud.

111
00:05:57.950 --> 00:06:01.670
He perpetuated it. He endorsed it. He should be ashamed of himself.

112
00:06:01.730 --> 00:06:04.970
And you guys should remember that the next time you're thinking of taking Jordan

113
00:06:04.971 --> 00:06:08.990
Belfort's advice. So he's such a nice guy. The guy is a shark.

114
00:06:09.170 --> 00:06:11.150
Let's be real speaking of sharks by the way.

115
00:06:11.750 --> 00:06:16.160
No else is a shark and a bad one at that. Damon John.

116
00:06:16.980 --> 00:06:19.160
Yeah. I remember the days we thought sharks were like, you know,

117
00:06:19.161 --> 00:06:21.770
skeptical businessmen, not they're actually.

118
00:06:22.720 --> 00:06:27.130
<v 3>Check this out. Gales. I'm Jason Bond here with a man who needs no introduction.</v>

119
00:06:27.370 --> 00:06:30.100
<v 0>Remember this is the guy being sued from the federal trade commission for fraud.</v>

120
00:06:30.280 --> 00:06:35.050
<v 3>Whatsoever. Damon John from ABC shark tank and the founder of FUBU.</v>

121
00:06:35.380 --> 00:06:38.110
<v 0>I started off the kid's life as an educator.</v>

122
00:06:38.350 --> 00:06:42.190
And I wanted people to realize that I can communicate with this person and

123
00:06:42.191 --> 00:06:44.650
they're going to be able to educate me. What was he?

124
00:06:44.651 --> 00:06:48.400
Was he an elementary school teacher? Was he a high school teacher? Either way?

125
00:06:48.550 --> 00:06:51.190
How does that qualify him to teach docs? Daymond.

126
00:06:51.191 --> 00:06:52.900
John seems to think you're a teacher.

127
00:06:52.960 --> 00:06:55.480
You're qualified to go do rocket science later.

128
00:06:56.350 --> 00:07:00.610
What the hell is wrong with this guy? Did he not vet Jason Bond at all?

129
00:07:01.240 --> 00:07:03.040
Step by step on how to improve my life.

130
00:07:03.220 --> 00:07:06.850
<v 3>As a trader just this year alone, over half a million dollars trading partner.</v>

131
00:07:07.240 --> 00:07:07.660
<v 0>Time. Guys,</v>

132
00:07:07.660 --> 00:07:12.310
let me remind you persistent and substantial losses over half a million dollars

133
00:07:12.311 --> 00:07:14.680
trading by the way, bond. Isn't his last name.

134
00:07:14.681 --> 00:07:18.160
He named himself that because you know, it sounds nice. You know,

135
00:07:18.161 --> 00:07:22.510
stocks and bonds, Jason Bond. Anyway, this is what the gurus all do.

136
00:07:22.630 --> 00:07:27.460
<v 3>Being a school teacher and now transforming my life to where I am today.</v>

137
00:07:27.520 --> 00:07:30.880
That's a powerful move form. Isn't it? Big career move.

138
00:07:31.300 --> 00:07:34.660
<v 0>I went from a school teacher to being sued by the federal trade commission,</v>

139
00:07:34.750 --> 00:07:39.010
moving up in the world. And I'm so happy that you're showing, uh, you know,

140
00:07:39.011 --> 00:07:41.350
my family, all these things that they can do.

141
00:07:41.351 --> 00:07:45.880
And one point I'm happy that you showed me because I'm doing it now as well,

142
00:07:46.600 --> 00:07:51.460
guys, Daymond, John was paid for this endorsement. It was not Oh,

143
00:07:51.490 --> 00:07:55.960
out of the kindness of my heart, I just like you. He was paid to do this.

144
00:07:56.710 --> 00:07:58.720
This is how social proof works.

145
00:07:58.960 --> 00:08:02.290
You think these guys just get endorsed by these crazy people? No,

146
00:08:02.291 --> 00:08:04.600
they pay for it in 2020,

147
00:08:04.601 --> 00:08:08.620
you can manufacture all the social proof you want from anybody you want.

148
00:08:08.621 --> 00:08:12.850
You can get a Kevin O'Leary cameo. You can get the Titans of trade with Damon.

149
00:08:12.851 --> 00:08:14.050
John. It's embarrassing.

150
00:08:14.410 --> 00:08:18.580
He's in why I flew Jason out here because after I realized that I was

151
00:08:18.610 --> 00:08:23.140
overlooking so much opportunity in the market and I do know stocks very well and

152
00:08:23.141 --> 00:08:27.040
I have excellent, excellent financial advisors. Yeah.

153
00:08:27.370 --> 00:08:30.160
I think that's what we're going to end at guys. Credibility of Damon.

154
00:08:30.161 --> 00:08:34.330
John destroyed credibility of this, man. I'm not sure he ever had it.

155
00:08:34.960 --> 00:08:39.250
Credibility of Jeff Bishop sustained substantial and persistent losses.

156
00:08:39.430 --> 00:08:43.870
Credibility of Jordan Belfort. Also down the tube. It's a bad look,

157
00:08:43.930 --> 00:08:46.960
but a good lesson. Good lesson in the stock. Traders,

158
00:08:46.961 --> 00:08:49.810
these unregistered people do yourself a favor,

159
00:08:49.840 --> 00:08:54.730
go get someone who's qualified to do what they're doing or learn to do it

160
00:08:54.790 --> 00:08:59.460
