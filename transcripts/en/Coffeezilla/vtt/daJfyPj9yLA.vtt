00:00:00.390 --> 00:00:01.223
<v 0>Ladies and gentlemen,</v>

2
00:00:01.260 --> 00:00:05.730
I'm a little off today because I keep getting the same comment over and over.

3
00:00:05.731 --> 00:00:09.730
You guys think you're so smart telling me, Hey, Hey Steven, uh, your, your,

4
00:00:09.870 --> 00:00:13.290
your door's backwards that it looks like you're standing outside of your office,

5
00:00:13.410 --> 00:00:15.390
not inside of your office. Hey,

6
00:00:15.750 --> 00:00:19.560
you guys haven't even seen the $10 million studio yet. I mean,

7
00:00:19.561 --> 00:00:21.660
you guys have to listen up every single episode.

8
00:00:21.661 --> 00:00:25.520
You can hear the faint sound here. I'll turn up, turn up the volume

9
00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:33.180
here. That that's the sound of construction for the $10 million studio

10
00:00:33.181 --> 00:00:34.110
going on. So yeah,

11
00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:37.110
actually I've been just sitting outside my office this entire time.

12
00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:38.520
People pass by all the time.

13
00:00:38.521 --> 00:00:41.910
You wonder why you have so many jump cuts is because people start walking by.

14
00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:46.860
So next time before you guys give me lip, let me do the work.

15
00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:47.970
So all part of the plan,

16
00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:51.810
we're going to show you the $10 million studio very shortly. In fact,

17
00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:55.020
I'm going to give you a sneak preview at the end of this video,

18
00:00:55.021 --> 00:00:57.600
but before any of that happens, sorry, we got to take these off.

19
00:00:57.660 --> 00:01:00.960
I want to tell you guys a story about diabetes Island.

20
00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:04.830
This is brought to you by our good friends at ClickBank. Let's watch.

21
00:01:04.880 --> 00:01:07.760
<v 1>Tell your children and husband, you love them and say goodbye. So the doctor,</v>

22
00:01:08.660 --> 00:01:12.080
you will be in a diabetic coma very soon. And I don't know what will happen.

23
00:01:12.081 --> 00:01:14.300
Next terrified and barely conscious.

24
00:01:14.380 --> 00:01:17.390
And my wife looked over at our two kids standing outside as he showed us the

25
00:01:17.391 --> 00:01:21.740
test results. A normal blood sugar reading was one 21st was four 88.

26
00:01:22.250 --> 00:01:25.100
<v 0>Watch the machine, watch the show. I'm not ready to comment on it yet. Huh?</v>

27
00:01:25.550 --> 00:01:27.650
<v 1>My bad-ass wife, the boss of our family,</v>

28
00:01:27.651 --> 00:01:31.520
a proud lady who would shut up anyone brave enough to give her lip trembling

29
00:01:31.521 --> 00:01:33.980
cold and white as a sheet, 30 short minutes,

30
00:01:34.220 --> 00:01:36.200
that was all he was giving my dear wife, Kathy,

31
00:01:36.201 --> 00:01:37.850
before she would fall into unconsciousness.

32
00:01:37.910 --> 00:01:40.850
As she lay in the cold steel hospital bed contemplating the most depressing

33
00:01:40.851 --> 00:01:43.130
future she could imagine. I felt ashamed,

34
00:01:43.570 --> 00:01:46.700
angry at God for inflicting this pain and misery on such a beautiful, caring,

35
00:01:46.701 --> 00:01:47.534
loving woman.

36
00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:52.430
<v 0>Uh, what is, don't bring God into this. Your wife's in a diabetic coma. God,</v>

37
00:01:52.431 --> 00:01:55.130
didn't put the hohos in her hand. I mean, what do you want me to tell you?

38
00:01:55.340 --> 00:01:57.290
So backup, sorry. He me off.

39
00:01:57.440 --> 00:01:59.270
<v 1>You see, despite what you've been told,</v>

40
00:01:59.630 --> 00:02:02.630
you're uncontrolled blood sugar and increasing belly fat has nothing to do with

41
00:02:02.870 --> 00:02:05.840
how many sugars or carbohydrates you eat, how much exercise you do,

42
00:02:06.020 --> 00:02:09.380
what medications you take or even genetics or the aging process.

43
00:02:09.710 --> 00:02:12.830
<v 0>This man's out here, overturning everything we know about diabetes.</v>

44
00:02:13.190 --> 00:02:18.140
Not due to food, not due to exercise, not even due to aging or genetics. What,

45
00:02:18.620 --> 00:02:19.730
what could it be?

46
00:02:20.030 --> 00:02:22.430
<v 1>But it is instead all down to a little known,</v>

47
00:02:22.431 --> 00:02:25.790
but highly dangerous toxin found on every corner of earth. Well.

48
00:02:26.480 --> 00:02:29.420
<v 0>Cores, it's the little note sacred. How could I have not done?</v>

49
00:02:29.480 --> 00:02:30.950
It's never diet and exercise.

50
00:02:30.980 --> 00:02:34.700
That's never the answer to any health problems on quick bag.

51
00:02:35.060 --> 00:02:38.180
What was I thinking? I know it was the little known secret,

52
00:02:38.210 --> 00:02:39.350
but what is that secret?

53
00:02:39.650 --> 00:02:44.480
<v 1>But there is an answer by using a simple 62nd habit twice a day known only to</v>

54
00:02:44.481 --> 00:02:48.140
the inhabitants of a small, barely populated AGN Island.

55
00:02:50.360 --> 00:02:51.680
<v 0>That's right ladies and gentlemen,</v>

56
00:02:51.740 --> 00:02:55.760
this is where we come to diabetes. Highland,

57
00:02:55.940 --> 00:03:00.520
diabetes Island is a special place in the hearts of this man. But first of all,

58
00:03:00.670 --> 00:03:01.780
who is this man?

59
00:03:02.820 --> 00:03:05.520
<v 1>My name is Eric Woodfield. I'm an iron worker, my wife,</v>

60
00:03:05.790 --> 00:03:08.550
Cathy and I live in Waco, New York. And I'm 53 years old.

61
00:03:09.750 --> 00:03:13.200
<v 0>Man, a blue collar man. He's the kind of man that wouldn't lie to you.</v>

62
00:03:13.590 --> 00:03:15.210
<v 1>I've been a hardworking guy, all my life,</v>

63
00:03:15.390 --> 00:03:18.960
scaling skyscrapers and even done some ship fitting in my day.

64
00:03:19.470 --> 00:03:21.780
<v 0>Ship, fitting the ship, man.</v>

65
00:03:22.080 --> 00:03:22.711
<v 1>Believe it or not.</v>

66
00:03:22.711 --> 00:03:26.100
I was even part of the cleanup crews sent to the ground zero after nine 11.

67
00:03:26.490 --> 00:03:29.940
<v 0>Oh, come on. Isn't it enough to lie to everyone?</v>

68
00:03:30.030 --> 00:03:33.330
Do you have to bring nine 11 into it? I probably could have guessed that.

69
00:03:33.390 --> 00:03:37.860
Honestly, if you'd given me some options, he's a ship fit, man. Of course he,

70
00:03:37.920 --> 00:03:39.840
he was on the cleanup crew of nine 11. In fact,

71
00:03:39.841 --> 00:03:42.510
he was also part of the seal team six rate on a Sama bin Ladin.

72
00:03:42.630 --> 00:03:44.040
That's the kind of man this man is.

73
00:03:44.280 --> 00:03:47.460
<v 1>Words are just so inadequate to try and share with you what I saw and felt</v>

74
00:03:47.461 --> 00:03:48.780
during those long, awful days,

75
00:03:48.840 --> 00:03:52.200
you really understand what it means to come under attack and you know,

76
00:03:52.201 --> 00:03:54.900
something that's happening to our bodies each and every day.

77
00:03:56.430 --> 00:04:01.080
<v 0>Did this man, just try to compare diabetes to a terrorist attack.</v>

78
00:04:01.140 --> 00:04:03.360
He's like, I know what it's like to be under attack from plane,

79
00:04:03.361 --> 00:04:06.750
hijacking terrorists. You know what else is a plane hijacking, terrorists,

80
00:04:07.080 --> 00:04:07.913
your blood cells,

81
00:04:09.720 --> 00:04:12.450
driving it right into the twin towers of your aorta.

82
00:04:12.810 --> 00:04:13.890
<v 1>Fortunately for you,</v>

83
00:04:14.070 --> 00:04:17.670
a bizarre chain of events handed me the weapon I needed to defeat this invisible

84
00:04:17.671 --> 00:04:21.600
diabetes causing toxin for good and save my wife's life.

85
00:04:21.930 --> 00:04:23.190
<v 0>Dude, if this were actually a true story,</v>

86
00:04:23.191 --> 00:04:25.800
which obviously I'm sure you guys know by now, it's not,

87
00:04:26.070 --> 00:04:28.110
this should be the greatest movie ever told.

88
00:04:28.140 --> 00:04:31.890
They'd make a Hollywood movie every year from this and then remake that movie

89
00:04:31.920 --> 00:04:34.770
every single year. This would be the greatest story of all time,

90
00:04:34.771 --> 00:04:36.720
if this were true, but you know what is true?

91
00:04:37.650 --> 00:04:41.700
This guy hates the belly fat that this diabetes caused.

92
00:04:41.760 --> 00:04:44.610
He found it disgusting. He keeps bringing it up in the story.

93
00:04:44.970 --> 00:04:46.410
<v 1>Piled on more and more weight.</v>

94
00:04:47.220 --> 00:04:50.460
She went from the energetic motivator to sluggish and overweight.

95
00:04:50.490 --> 00:04:54.210
Then the space of just four years Kathy's weight had ballooned from a relatively

96
00:04:54.211 --> 00:04:57.600
healthy 160 pounds to a massive 206.

97
00:04:58.020 --> 00:04:59.790
<v 0>Yeah, you can't talk about your wife that way.</v>

98
00:04:59.791 --> 00:05:03.240
Don't use the word massive as an adjective, by the way,

99
00:05:03.330 --> 00:05:06.300
let's have a look at those little a before and after. Shall we.

100
00:05:06.690 --> 00:05:09.630
<v 1>Going from this to a slim and sexy 160?</v>

101
00:05:10.350 --> 00:05:12.930
<v 0>Because all of a sudden when the magic diet is tried,</v>

102
00:05:13.080 --> 00:05:17.610
we get a before and after that seemed a little sus computer enhance

103
00:05:17.940 --> 00:05:21.780
something about those faces seem suspicious. First of all,

104
00:05:21.840 --> 00:05:23.100
nothing in her face changed.

105
00:05:23.460 --> 00:05:26.370
Kathy has the remarkable ability to maintain the exact same face shape.

106
00:05:26.400 --> 00:05:30.630
Even after going from a massive 216 pounds to a relatively healthy

107
00:05:30.660 --> 00:05:32.790
160 pounds. So of course, you know me,

108
00:05:32.791 --> 00:05:34.710
I had to look into it and what do you know?

109
00:05:34.830 --> 00:05:38.820
Somebody else actually did the work for me, Contra health scam, shout out.

110
00:05:39.030 --> 00:05:43.740
They discovered that this lady had been photo-shopped from another

111
00:05:43.741 --> 00:05:46.440
weight loss journey. This is the real lady.

112
00:05:46.441 --> 00:05:50.370
Her name is Kristen w and she won a little prize for losing the most weight.

113
00:05:50.371 --> 00:05:54.120
And they took this poor lady and they photo-shopped her and Photoshop the new

114
00:05:54.121 --> 00:05:58.100
face on her to give her the face of a nine 11 wife. Right?

115
00:05:58.340 --> 00:06:03.140
But let's suspend our disbelief and continue with this journey of Eric

116
00:06:03.140 --> 00:06:06.860
Whitfield. He's on a quest to discover the true cost, the hidden secret.

117
00:06:06.950 --> 00:06:08.360
They don't want you to know about it.

118
00:06:08.500 --> 00:06:11.380
<v 1>I'd left online posts on forums and message boards.</v>

119
00:06:11.620 --> 00:06:16.150
<v 0>He's all in like four Chan or eight Chan asking Q what the secret to diabetes is.</v>

120
00:06:16.660 --> 00:06:19.570
<v 1>Fly from a man. We will call Kevin over a call.</v>

121
00:06:19.690 --> 00:06:23.800
He revealed to me the three closely guarded and biggest lies of the diabetic

122
00:06:23.801 --> 00:06:26.830
industry. And this is the big diabetes lie. Number one,

123
00:06:27.400 --> 00:06:30.040
lowering blood sugar will reverse diabetes. Next.

124
00:06:30.041 --> 00:06:33.370
Kevin revealed big diabetes lie. Number two, this one shocked me.

125
00:06:33.760 --> 00:06:35.380
Exercise helps reverse diabetes.

126
00:06:35.740 --> 00:06:37.690
<v 0>Like the, this guy is just lying to you. I mean,</v>

127
00:06:37.691 --> 00:06:41.710
I hope everyone knows that and giving out harmful information exercise actually

128
00:06:41.711 --> 00:06:45.100
does help. Also. He can sell you a stupid product.

129
00:06:45.430 --> 00:06:46.241
<v 1>If medications,</v>

130
00:06:46.241 --> 00:06:49.840
exercise and carb restrictions had done nothing and would never do anything to

131
00:06:49.841 --> 00:06:53.280
help Kathy's diabetes, then what could help badly? Kevin didn't have the.

132
00:06:53.650 --> 00:06:56.350
<v 0>And that's when he discovered diabetes Island.</v>

133
00:06:56.650 --> 00:06:57.820
<v 1>And I was close to giving up.</v>

134
00:06:58.060 --> 00:07:00.610
And that's when I discovered something that chilled me to the bone.

135
00:07:00.910 --> 00:07:05.560
<v 0>Oh, sorry. We got to get into the super dramatic story. Before we get into that.</v>

136
00:07:05.680 --> 00:07:06.513
Hold on one.

137
00:07:07.390 --> 00:07:08.650
<v 1>I'm embarrassed to share this with you,</v>

138
00:07:08.651 --> 00:07:12.850
but I feel I have to using Kathy's laptop. One night,

139
00:07:12.910 --> 00:07:16.660
I stumbled onto some of her Google searches. Best way to kill yourself.

140
00:07:17.040 --> 00:07:17.873
I had one query.

141
00:07:18.130 --> 00:07:21.730
<v 0>Yay lady. Just cut back on the Twinkies a little bit.</v>

142
00:07:21.760 --> 00:07:23.370
You don't have to go that way.

143
00:07:23.500 --> 00:07:28.180
We all eat a few too many quarter pounders from time to time, just chill out,

144
00:07:28.240 --> 00:07:29.920
eat a salad. It's not going to kill you.

145
00:07:30.130 --> 00:07:33.790
<v 1>I had no idea. Kathy was feeling that low. I was desperate to help her,</v>

146
00:07:33.791 --> 00:07:35.200
but I didn't know how,

147
00:07:35.530 --> 00:07:38.320
but that very night I received a phone call that would change everything.

148
00:07:38.470 --> 00:07:39.880
That call came from my boss.

149
00:07:40.210 --> 00:07:43.750
I had gotten an offer earlier that week for a big project over in Greece.

150
00:07:44.020 --> 00:07:46.930
Pardon? After, after my long flight, I'm introduced to the team of guys.

151
00:07:46.931 --> 00:07:51.730
I was supervising a group of 19 men from all over Greece among those

152
00:07:51.850 --> 00:07:55.270
was Alexander Duka and seven other guys who came to work on the project from

153
00:07:55.271 --> 00:07:58.570
their home on a tiny Greek Island called how come.

154
00:07:58.630 --> 00:08:01.450
<v 0>Welcome. We finally come full circle. Geez. These things.</v>

155
00:08:02.190 --> 00:08:02.921
<v 1>As the weeks went on,</v>

156
00:08:02.921 --> 00:08:06.220
I came to realize these eight guys who were all in their mid fifties didn't have

157
00:08:06.221 --> 00:08:10.450
diabetes or even a single symptom of it. They were slim healthy. And.

158
00:08:11.170 --> 00:08:13.360
<v 0>Yeah, maybe it's because they're outside working.</v>

159
00:08:13.900 --> 00:08:17.110
<v 1>Back home. I didn't know of one person over 50 who didn't have diabetes,</v>

160
00:08:17.140 --> 00:08:18.370
let alone eight of them.

161
00:08:19.000 --> 00:08:22.060
So that night I took Alex to one side and told him all about my wife's

162
00:08:22.061 --> 00:08:23.710
conditions. Alex smiled,

163
00:08:23.711 --> 00:08:27.970
patted me on the shoulder and told me to wait where I was a few minutes later,

164
00:08:27.971 --> 00:08:31.660
he returned with a notepad and a pencil and began to scribble down what looked

165
00:08:31.661 --> 00:08:34.900
like a recipe. What's this? I asked looking down the list,

166
00:08:35.470 --> 00:08:37.600
the secret you've been searching for. He said with a Glint in his eye.

167
00:08:38.020 --> 00:08:40.060
<v 0>You see Eric, I'm a wizard.</v>

168
00:08:40.900 --> 00:08:45.130
<v 1>Our health is all down to the food we eat. He continued mysterious.</v>

169
00:08:45.880 --> 00:08:48.550
<v 0>Not that mysterious, but a second ago you were saying diet,</v>

170
00:08:48.730 --> 00:08:51.310
does it have anything to do with diabetes? Which is it, Eric, come on,

171
00:08:51.340 --> 00:08:51.890
come on now.

172
00:08:51.890 --> 00:08:56.430
<v 1>Like eat these foods and your wife will recover with that. Alex stood up,</v>

173
00:08:56.610 --> 00:08:59.190
gave me a knowing smile and got back to work.

174
00:08:59.760 --> 00:09:02.490
The only thing that I remember that Alex and his friends always made those

175
00:09:02.491 --> 00:09:06.060
homemade dressings with their lunch and dinner. Sometimes even as a snack.

176
00:09:06.380 --> 00:09:08.330
<v 0>That's right, the secrets dressings.</v>

177
00:09:08.390 --> 00:09:11.030
They're going to teach you how to make for a small fee. But look,

178
00:09:11.060 --> 00:09:15.500
if you think that's already gone to a conspiracy level, just wait.

179
00:09:16.190 --> 00:09:16.371
<v 1>Now,</v>

180
00:09:16.371 --> 00:09:20.150
stay with me here because this is where it gets very interesting particulate

181
00:09:20.151 --> 00:09:21.380
matter. Also known as PM.

182
00:09:21.381 --> 00:09:26.210
2.5 is a complex mixture of extremely small particles and liquid

183
00:09:26.211 --> 00:09:30.440
droplets. They are admitted by fuel Bernie and various industrial sources,

184
00:09:30.830 --> 00:09:34.910
but then get into the air and are inhaled. It's pretty scary, right? You see,

185
00:09:34.911 --> 00:09:36.710
this is the real cause of your diabetes.

186
00:09:36.860 --> 00:09:39.710
We know it's not because of your diet or how much exercise you do.

187
00:09:39.770 --> 00:09:44.090
Your health has been deteriorating because of the invisible PM. 2.5,

188
00:09:44.540 --> 00:09:46.850
which has been seeping into your bloodstream for days.

189
00:09:47.210 --> 00:09:50.270
<v 0>Get your tinfoil hats on boys. This Alice ain't seen nothing yet.</v>

190
00:09:50.740 --> 00:09:54.560
<v 1>For this graph. We see diabetes started around the 1940s.</v>

191
00:09:55.100 --> 00:09:59.090
Now look at this graph of PM. 2.5 levels over time. Look familiar.

192
00:09:59.420 --> 00:10:03.710
Notice the rapid incline at 1940 matches exactly when diabetes

193
00:10:03.770 --> 00:10:05.240
spiraled out of control.

194
00:10:05.900 --> 00:10:09.890
<v 0>Oh, come on Eric. No, don't do that to us.</v>

195
00:10:09.920 --> 00:10:12.920
Don't give us the correlation equals causation argument, please.

196
00:10:13.040 --> 00:10:16.160
You guys ever seen the cheese conspiracy before? Hey, check this out.

197
00:10:16.610 --> 00:10:20.990
Cheese consumption is apparently correlated with people who died by becoming

198
00:10:20.991 --> 00:10:23.690
tangled in their bedsheets. Coincidence.

199
00:10:24.140 --> 00:10:26.720
Is it a coincidence that when people eat more cheese,

200
00:10:26.750 --> 00:10:28.790
they get strangled in their bedsheets? I think not.

201
00:10:29.000 --> 00:10:30.830
<v 1>Yeah, it really, it was making sense now. And guess what?</v>

202
00:10:31.460 --> 00:10:34.400
While the level of pollution in Greece was one of the highest in the world,

203
00:10:34.640 --> 00:10:38.840
far higher than the U S I found out that they actually had one of the lowest

204
00:10:38.841 --> 00:10:39.980
levels of diabetes.

205
00:10:40.160 --> 00:10:40.941
<v 0>Hey boss,</v>

206
00:10:40.941 --> 00:10:44.420
we found out that our hypothesis is severely undercut by the fact that Greece

207
00:10:44.421 --> 00:10:48.650
has way higher pollution levels than anywhere else. What should we say? Oh,

208
00:10:49.040 --> 00:10:52.850
Oh, it just must be that the dressings that are so powerful.

209
00:10:53.510 --> 00:10:57.260
<v 1>It must be because of these traditional dressings and the ingredients that make</v>

210
00:10:57.261 --> 00:10:58.094
them up.

211
00:10:58.130 --> 00:11:00.650
<v 0>But the actual crazy thing is these guys, uh,</v>

212
00:11:00.680 --> 00:11:04.070
conveniently failed to mention that PM 2.5 emissions.

213
00:11:04.071 --> 00:11:08.120
They cut the graph off at 2006 conveniently because they've actually been

214
00:11:08.121 --> 00:11:09.560
falling in recent years.

215
00:11:09.710 --> 00:11:14.180
So the little theory doesn't line up when diabetes goes up and PM two,

216
00:11:14.181 --> 00:11:16.970
five goes down. They've literally cut off the graph, right?

217
00:11:16.971 --> 00:11:20.690
When it disproves their theory completely because instead of actually telling

218
00:11:20.691 --> 00:11:21.500
the truth,

219
00:11:21.500 --> 00:11:25.850
they want to spin up a crazy conspiracy theory to endanger you so they can make

220
00:11:25.851 --> 00:11:29.360
money brought to you by the guy who's stealing Valor from first responders at

221
00:11:29.361 --> 00:11:33.380
nine 11. Anyways, I think that's a happy way to wrap it up. Uh,

222
00:11:33.410 --> 00:11:34.430
needless to say,

223
00:11:34.760 --> 00:11:38.900
don't ever follow these idiots advice or really anything you see on ClickBank.

224
00:11:39.080 --> 00:11:39.831
That's all for now.

225
00:11:39.831 --> 00:11:43.340
I think you guys have really earned this sneak peek that I'm about to show you
