00:00:00.420 --> 00:00:02.670
<v 0>There've been a lot of celebrity endorse products over the years.</v>

2
00:00:02.700 --> 00:00:07.290
Some have been ridiculous. Some of them cringy, Hey guys, I'm whole Cogan,

3
00:00:07.320 --> 00:00:09.720
but very few of them have actually been good.

4
00:00:10.170 --> 00:00:14.220
And among this pile of failing a Lister, American celeb one,

5
00:00:14.221 --> 00:00:15.180
man stands above.

6
00:00:16.880 --> 00:00:20.960
<v 1>Aviation, American gin. If you're drinking anything else, you're drinking.</v>

7
00:00:21.710 --> 00:00:25.880
<v 0>Welcome to a daily YouTube channel guys. As we know, pure quality here,</v>

8
00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:28.310
today's the first installment of marketing Mondays,

9
00:00:28.311 --> 00:00:32.960
where we demystified the success, the disasters of the marketing world.

10
00:00:33.260 --> 00:00:35.930
I'm going to be answering the age old question today in episode one,

11
00:00:35.931 --> 00:00:40.490
how do you make people watch an edge? Traditionally, the answer has been forced,

12
00:00:40.520 --> 00:00:41.990
forced down their throats with a commercial,

13
00:00:43.700 --> 00:00:47.870
but it's 2021 guys that feels a little aggressive in a time where kids know

14
00:00:48.380 --> 00:00:50.060
consent is cool.

15
00:00:50.810 --> 00:00:55.550
So the real question is how do you make people want to watch an ad to consent to

16
00:00:55.551 --> 00:00:58.460
it? The answer normally has been to use celebrities,

17
00:00:58.461 --> 00:01:01.250
but the problem is it doesn't normally work out as bland,

18
00:01:01.490 --> 00:01:04.310
but popular people in sterilized, scripted environments.

19
00:01:04.340 --> 00:01:09.230
Something still feels off even in multimillion dollar photo shoots with the best

20
00:01:09.231 --> 00:01:10.400
copy editors in the world.

21
00:01:10.730 --> 00:01:15.590
You know that Chris rock really doesn't care about the 5g network of Verizon

22
00:01:15.591 --> 00:01:16.130
wireless.

23
00:01:16.130 --> 00:01:20.300
<v 1>This is a game changer, five G five G five G five G.</v>

24
00:01:22.220 --> 00:01:22.250
<v 0>Well,</v>

25
00:01:22.250 --> 00:01:26.270
not only that you could replace Chris rock with literally any celebrity and the

26
00:01:26.271 --> 00:01:30.830
result would be the exact same, not exactly inspiring. So you tune out the ad,

27
00:01:30.980 --> 00:01:35.450
but you know whose YouTube channel hasn't been tuned out. Ryan freakin Reynolds,

28
00:01:35.480 --> 00:01:40.400
this man has accumulated almost half a billion views, just organic traffic,

29
00:01:40.430 --> 00:01:44.540
no PPC required. And the content all adds for like random stuff.

30
00:01:44.541 --> 00:01:47.780
You wouldn't think are viral successes, Jen. Okay.

31
00:01:47.990 --> 00:01:51.290
Maybe objectively the worst alcoholic beverage. Sorry guys.

32
00:01:51.380 --> 00:01:55.850
You've got budget mobile wireless and you've got dating websites. Okay.

33
00:01:56.180 --> 00:01:59.060
Not exactly a recipe, a trifecta for virality,

34
00:01:59.150 --> 00:02:02.420
but if you're like me and you thought that you're an idiot because millions of

35
00:02:02.421 --> 00:02:05.810
people tune into this kind of content with the most popular comment,

36
00:02:05.811 --> 00:02:09.140
being that this is the most popular type of ad that people would will willingly

37
00:02:09.141 --> 00:02:09.890
watch.

38
00:02:09.890 --> 00:02:13.940
And to the marketing skeptics like me who know that views don't equal purchases.

39
00:02:14.090 --> 00:02:17.330
You should note that these ad campaigns have been enormously successful for the

40
00:02:17.331 --> 00:02:18.800
companies that he's partnered with. Mint.

41
00:02:18.801 --> 00:02:22.370
Mobile had a huge surge in popularity and aviation gin just sold for

42
00:02:22.371 --> 00:02:26.540
$600 million. That's right. Million. Now of course,

43
00:02:26.541 --> 00:02:29.090
success is never just one thing. But viral marketing always helps.

44
00:02:29.180 --> 00:02:32.060
So what is he doing? Right? It's three things. It's funny.

45
00:02:32.150 --> 00:02:35.000
It's self-aware and the brand always looks good. Now,

46
00:02:35.030 --> 00:02:38.780
most celebrity endorsements I've realized after watching a bunch of them way too

47
00:02:38.781 --> 00:02:42.110
many nail number three, the brand looks good. Let's look at that.

48
00:02:42.111 --> 00:02:45.080
Chris rock commercial, right? The iPhone looks beautiful.

49
00:02:45.230 --> 00:02:48.920
The whole ad actually is just this beautiful thing, but it's not funny.

50
00:02:48.921 --> 00:02:52.520
It's not self-aware. And in fact, it's just all staged and boring.

51
00:02:52.670 --> 00:02:56.360
Now a rare exception to this is the celebrity endorsement that hit one and two.

52
00:02:56.361 --> 00:02:58.970
It's funny it's self-aware but these often come at the,

53
00:02:59.470 --> 00:03:03.280
of the brand take for example, bill Burr. He's a hilarious example of this.

54
00:03:03.281 --> 00:03:05.860
He always insults his sponsors as he reads them.

55
00:03:06.270 --> 00:03:10.530
<v 2>Right, right out of the bat. This sounds creepy to me, video doorbell,</v>

56
00:03:12.120 --> 00:03:15.510
a will insert dinging sound. What does that mean?

57
00:03:15.511 --> 00:03:18.810
I was supposed to insert ding dunks. All right. Let's do that again.

58
00:03:19.830 --> 00:03:21.360
Or built-in rechargeable battery.

59
00:03:22.530 --> 00:03:26.070
Put your mind at ease and protect your home and your parakeet

60
00:03:27.450 --> 00:03:28.800
with the video doorbell,

61
00:03:29.550 --> 00:03:33.270
time magazine named one of the top 10 gadgets of 2014

62
00:03:34.950 --> 00:03:36.060
Sheridan Kilmore porpoises.

63
00:03:36.420 --> 00:03:39.960
Cause eventually you have to throw out the wires and they will end up in the

64
00:03:39.961 --> 00:03:40.291
ocean.

65
00:03:40.291 --> 00:03:45.240
But right now my listeners get the ring video doorbell for

66
00:03:45.241 --> 00:03:49.860
only $174. That's $25 off the normal price.

67
00:03:50.860 --> 00:03:52.200
Still kind of expensive though. You know,

68
00:03:55.230 --> 00:03:59.760
it comes with a doorbell already attached. He's still making payments anyways.

69
00:03:59.970 --> 00:04:01.740
<v 0>Okay. You're coming out of that. It's funny.</v>

70
00:04:01.741 --> 00:04:05.220
It's self-aware but you're not going to buy a ring doorbell. If anything,

71
00:04:05.250 --> 00:04:06.720
you're not going to buy it anymore.

72
00:04:06.930 --> 00:04:10.500
But sitting somewhere right in the sweet spot is an ad that manages to be funny

73
00:04:10.501 --> 00:04:14.700
self-aware and makes the brand look good all at once. Take for instance,

74
00:04:14.701 --> 00:04:15.930
this ad within an ad,

75
00:04:15.990 --> 00:04:20.100
within an ad where Ryan Reynolds buys mid-roll ad placement for his gin company.

76
00:04:20.370 --> 00:04:21.203
My new movie.

77
00:04:21.270 --> 00:04:24.120
<v 1>Underground is so huge. You're going to want to watch it on a bigger,</v>

78
00:04:24.600 --> 00:04:28.290
better Samsung Q led TV. Oh.

79
00:04:29.220 --> 00:04:32.130
<v 0>Aviation gin. How'd that get there now. That's good advertising.</v>

80
00:04:32.310 --> 00:04:35.400
And if you're thinking that the only reason this ad works is because gin is fun.

81
00:04:35.610 --> 00:04:39.090
Let's talk about 5g with a mobile carrier network. Okay.

82
00:04:39.270 --> 00:04:42.150
It's about as exciting as dental work, but watch this.

83
00:04:42.660 --> 00:04:45.600
<v 1>To believe that 5g is as amazing as everyone is saying.</v>

84
00:04:45.601 --> 00:04:48.720
So we've brought in min mobile head of technology.

85
00:04:48.721 --> 00:04:51.570
Rizwan Kaseem to explain it to us Riz. Well,

86
00:04:51.571 --> 00:04:54.570
5g is substantially more spectrally efficient with lower latency.

87
00:04:54.780 --> 00:04:57.180
So it's an order of magnitude improvement over 4g.

88
00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:01.950
It seems we may never know what 5g is.

89
00:05:01.951 --> 00:05:05.370
So we're just going to give it away for free with every plan until we can figure

90
00:05:05.371 --> 00:05:05.970
that out.

91
00:05:05.970 --> 00:05:08.670
<v 0>You just got about to the master well-played Ryan Reynolds,</v>

92
00:05:08.700 --> 00:05:11.580
you managed to make 3 million people voluntarily sit through an ad.

93
00:05:12.510 --> 00:05:15.240
Well-played indeed. All right. That's basically it.

94
00:05:15.241 --> 00:05:17.670
I hope you enjoyed this episode of marketing Mondays.

95
00:05:17.790 --> 00:05:21.270
If you did leave a comment below letting me know who you'd like to see next

96
00:05:21.390 --> 00:05:24.390
featured next on marketing Mondays, it can be great advertising.

97
00:05:24.391 --> 00:05:26.070
It can be terrible advertising,

98
00:05:26.071 --> 00:05:30.750
but I thought we'd take a little diversion from the usual scams that we talk

99
00:05:30.751 --> 00:05:35.100
about and talk about real advertising that either succeeds works really well,

100
00:05:35.101 --> 00:05:39.510
crushes it or completely bombed. And we'll analyze it on this channel.

101
00:05:39.900 --> 00:05:41.460
Let me know if you enjoy it, seeing the next one.
