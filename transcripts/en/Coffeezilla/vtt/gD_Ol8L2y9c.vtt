00:00:00.270 --> 00:00:01.320
<v 0>Ladies and gentlemen,</v>

2
00:00:01.470 --> 00:00:05.940
now that I'm a big shot daily utuber I decided it was time to come clean on all

3
00:00:05.941 --> 00:00:08.880
the times. I've been wrong. I know you're thinking,

4
00:00:09.210 --> 00:00:13.260
never know I've been wrong. One time 2020,

5
00:00:13.261 --> 00:00:16.860
there was a little bit of a blip in my, in the error of my ways.

6
00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:19.800
When I told Kayla Maddox that he was wrong,

7
00:00:20.090 --> 00:00:23.540
guys don't know Caleb Maddix is he's an 18 year old life coach.

8
00:00:23.660 --> 00:00:25.130
He's got it all figured out.

9
00:00:25.340 --> 00:00:29.300
And when he told me that Reddit it videos were in his words,

10
00:00:29.930 --> 00:00:34.280
the greatest opportunity of our era, I said, are you joking?

11
00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:38.750
Prepare yourself. Greatest income opportunity, Reddit videos.

12
00:00:39.170 --> 00:00:41.330
It's the opportunity of our hair. And honestly,

13
00:00:41.331 --> 00:00:44.750
he kind of fled away from the internet. I actually feel bad about it.

14
00:00:44.751 --> 00:00:47.270
To this day. I reach out to him daily saying, Hey, love,

15
00:00:47.271 --> 00:00:51.380
we need the white tea method back. But the truth is jokes aside.

16
00:00:51.440 --> 00:00:55.060
I think he was actually right, looking at all the big daily YouTube.

17
00:00:55.280 --> 00:00:59.450
She got PewDiePie. K S a lot of pies.

18
00:00:59.930 --> 00:01:01.940
You got video game dunky okay.

19
00:01:01.941 --> 00:01:04.910
All these daily you tubers who are crushing it right now in the views.

20
00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:06.800
What do they all do? Reddit video,

21
00:01:06.860 --> 00:01:11.360
actually video game dunky doesn't do Reddit videos that defeats my

22
00:01:11.720 --> 00:01:15.680
rule. But the point is a lot of these big YouTubers. They do Reddit videos. Why?

23
00:01:16.010 --> 00:01:20.870
Because it makes good content to get content, to react to you guys,

24
00:01:20.871 --> 00:01:24.230
get to interact with me. I get to interact with you. So because of that,

25
00:01:24.530 --> 00:01:26.540
I've seen the light look going daily.

26
00:01:26.720 --> 00:01:30.050
Things have changed around here in the copies of LA $10 million studio.

27
00:01:30.380 --> 00:01:32.300
A lot of things are going to be changing in the future too,

28
00:01:32.810 --> 00:01:37.370
but I've really taken a new look at a lot of things that I used to make fun of

29
00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:39.080
and Reddit videos as well. One of them.

30
00:01:39.380 --> 00:01:44.210
So if you'd like to participate in a new segment on our show, you can go here.

31
00:01:44.360 --> 00:01:47.870
It's copies of LA underscore, GG.

32
00:01:48.800 --> 00:01:51.350
Here it is boys. Right now. It's an unofficial Reddit.

33
00:01:51.351 --> 00:01:54.200
I'm trying to talk with you. The moderator who created this, uh,

34
00:01:54.201 --> 00:01:56.810
to try to make it the official Reddit. But anyways,

35
00:01:57.680 --> 00:02:00.020
you got to post and you know what? To kick it off.

36
00:02:00.380 --> 00:02:04.610
Just so you guys just to give the people who created this a little bit of a

37
00:02:05.300 --> 00:02:08.720
headstart, I'm getting everyone who's bought free Reddit, gold,

38
00:02:10.280 --> 00:02:14.720
gold, gold for you, sir. Gold for you,

39
00:02:15.200 --> 00:02:17.810
gold for you. Coffees delivers Dean Graziosi.

40
00:02:18.200 --> 00:02:21.590
A mindset coach's reaction will give you that gold for that. Listen,

41
00:02:21.740 --> 00:02:25.670
it won't be always this easy to get gold ladies and gentlemen, but for now,

42
00:02:25.730 --> 00:02:28.580
it is look at this. God, God, some of these are bots.

43
00:02:28.610 --> 00:02:32.900
Some of these posts have been deleted, but look, undead Marine, Hey,

44
00:02:33.740 --> 00:02:37.910
coffee, Zillow featured on baller. Buster's IgG goal. Another one goal.

45
00:02:38.450 --> 00:02:41.960
You guys get the idea. Even the comments, Steve jobs mentored me,

46
00:02:42.260 --> 00:02:45.170
but actually just an honor doctors. Hey gold.

47
00:02:45.530 --> 00:02:48.710
Now that is the exact kind of reckless Reddit gold gifting.

48
00:02:48.711 --> 00:02:51.200
You can expect if you joined the unofficial,

49
00:02:51.350 --> 00:02:55.550
but now official separated the coffee's elite copies L underscore GG. Join.

50
00:02:55.580 --> 00:02:58.730
Now submit your memes. I have a feeling. This is going to just turn into people,

51
00:02:58.731 --> 00:03:03.220
making of me for being a Hobbit for having a large head.

52
00:03:03.221 --> 00:03:07.690
I don't know. But uh, I think it be fun anyway. I think it'll be a fun time now.

53
00:03:07.930 --> 00:03:11.710
Thank you for sitting through that. It's a little pitch Fest.

54
00:03:12.100 --> 00:03:15.910
Now let's talk about Kayla Maddox again, because yes, he's a man of wisdom.

55
00:03:15.911 --> 00:03:19.870
Now I realized I was wrong about him. In fact, not only is a man of wisdom.

56
00:03:19.900 --> 00:03:24.310
He's actually back. He took a little siesta after our talk, a break,

57
00:03:24.580 --> 00:03:27.250
but he's back in action and he's better than ever. Ladies and gentlemen,

58
00:03:27.460 --> 00:03:31.000
he started something called maximum wage. Okay?

59
00:03:31.360 --> 00:03:33.550
So let's listen in and figure out what's going on.

60
00:03:33.840 --> 00:03:38.460
<v 1>Congratulations. You've officially finished the mentality portion of maximum.</v>

61
00:03:38.461 --> 00:03:41.730
You don't want people like the graduate because it is a big gathering.

62
00:03:41.731 --> 00:03:44.190
Everyone fills the stadium. They all wear their cap. Let me.

63
00:03:44.580 --> 00:03:46.410
<v 0>Guess maximum wages, just like that.</v>

64
00:03:46.740 --> 00:03:49.410
<v 1>Well, I honestly believe like this is just as big of a deal.</v>

65
00:03:49.411 --> 00:03:52.620
This is a bigger deal than that because what you guys learned in this?

66
00:03:52.680 --> 00:03:54.030
What set you guys up for how?

67
00:03:59.550 --> 00:04:01.710
<v 2>Oh my gosh.</v>

68
00:04:02.160 --> 00:04:05.310
<v 0>No, it's not. It's not as big of a deal as college.</v>

69
00:04:05.400 --> 00:04:09.780
What's this kid's name Brian or something. Ryan, come on Ryan, get it together.

70
00:04:10.620 --> 00:04:12.270
Next. You're going to be comparing it to Harvard.

71
00:04:12.720 --> 00:04:13.710
<v 1>Oh, so you guys have to be maximum.</v>

72
00:04:13.950 --> 00:04:17.070
Wage is so much more important than anything you could ever learn in college.

73
00:04:17.130 --> 00:04:20.280
The life skills that you learn are way more important than anything you'll ever

74
00:04:20.281 --> 00:04:22.680
learn in college. Truthfully, like he just said,

75
00:04:22.710 --> 00:04:26.910
I really believe that what you guys learn a maximum wage is more valuable than

76
00:04:26.911 --> 00:04:28.200
spending 30 years at Harvard.

77
00:04:32.340 --> 00:04:33.990
<v 0>Let's go back. I just have to hear that again.</v>

78
00:04:34.380 --> 00:04:37.950
<v 1>What you guys learn a maximum wage is more valuable than spending 30 years of</v>

79
00:04:37.951 --> 00:04:38.784
Harvard.

80
00:04:39.840 --> 00:04:41.520
<v 2>He's learned nothing. Guys.</v>

81
00:04:41.880 --> 00:04:45.840
<v 0>I thought Caleb Maddix picked something up from the whole white tea disaster.</v>

82
00:04:45.930 --> 00:04:48.150
But he's saying that this Duke glass,

83
00:04:48.420 --> 00:04:50.790
that glass greatest opportunity of our era,

84
00:04:50.910 --> 00:04:53.520
this glass more important than 30 years at Harvard.

85
00:04:53.820 --> 00:04:55.860
This is a guy who's never been to Harvard,

86
00:04:56.070 --> 00:04:58.920
but it's more important than 30 years at Harvard.

87
00:04:58.950 --> 00:05:03.150
I'm so sick of this kind of look, I know college is too expensive,

88
00:05:03.180 --> 00:05:08.040
but these people are ridiculous. Now that's not the only Caleb Maddix take that.

89
00:05:08.041 --> 00:05:11.700
I was kind of surprised by there's actually another Caleb. I got to say,

90
00:05:11.730 --> 00:05:15.480
even though you were right about Reddit, um, what is this?

91
00:05:16.620 --> 00:05:19.980
The real pandemic is the spreading of a victim mentality.

92
00:05:21.120 --> 00:05:22.080
<v 2>Kayla medics.</v>

93
00:05:26.340 --> 00:05:28.140
<v 0>If he wasn't so young, I think this will be funnier.</v>

94
00:05:28.170 --> 00:05:32.460
I think we all understand that Caleb Maddix is definitely approaching a point in

95
00:05:32.461 --> 00:05:34.110
his life where he's going to realize a lot of this stuff.

96
00:05:34.111 --> 00:05:35.820
He said when he was younger was dumb.

97
00:05:36.210 --> 00:05:38.460
So I'm not going to fault him too hard for this.

98
00:05:38.880 --> 00:05:40.830
<v 2>But Caleb just.</v>

99
00:05:43.740 --> 00:05:46.590
<v 0>I don't know. Thank goodness I wasn't on Twitter when I was that young,</v>

100
00:05:46.950 --> 00:05:50.010
because I probably would've said some dumb stuff too, but wow.

101
00:05:50.011 --> 00:05:54.420
That is a bad take. Okay. Well there's your first meme boys.

102
00:05:54.570 --> 00:05:57.980
I'm giving you that one for free. Go to coffees. L underscore Gigi.

103
00:05:58.430 --> 00:05:59.960
If you want to meme along with me,

104
00:06:00.350 --> 00:06:02.060
I'll see you there and I'll see you in the next one.
