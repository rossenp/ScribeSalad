00:00:00.240 --> 00:00:02.520
<v 0>In a world where scammers run a muck,</v>

2
00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:06.900
one internet detective is ready to call all of them out.

3
00:00:07.530 --> 00:00:10.710
Ladies and gentlemen, without further ado,

4
00:00:11.460 --> 00:00:15.930
I am your CFO coffees. Hello, and welcome to fake guru Fridays guys.

5
00:00:15.931 --> 00:00:19.800
That's right. That's each day has a theme and we're bringing it back.

6
00:00:20.010 --> 00:00:22.290
Fake GRU Fridays is one of my favorite days that I don't know,

7
00:00:22.291 --> 00:00:25.110
we just kind of lost it in the mix. So we're bringing it back.

8
00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:28.230
And today we're answering an age old question, which is, you know,

9
00:00:28.440 --> 00:00:33.000
pyramid schemes are often pitched to people who don't have much financial

10
00:00:33.001 --> 00:00:33.570
know-how.

11
00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:37.230
They're usually pitched to lower income communities who just don't know better.

12
00:00:37.231 --> 00:00:40.050
Who are desperate. You know, you get the idea. It's nothing on them.

13
00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:41.880
It's just this predatory tactic.

14
00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:45.960
But what happens when you try to pitch to real investors,

15
00:00:46.290 --> 00:00:50.130
a pyramid scape, you know, an insane idea. What do you do?

16
00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:54.630
What a real investors do when they are pitched insane ideas? Well,

17
00:00:54.690 --> 00:00:58.440
the result is incredible. Uh, but for this,

18
00:00:58.441 --> 00:01:03.060
we're going to have to go to the computer. So let's go, wow, look,

19
00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:06.000
nice graphics, fancy graphics paid a lot of money for that.

20
00:01:06.001 --> 00:01:10.950
I hope you guys appreciate the $10 million studio guys. Let's be real,

21
00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:15.570
uh, very legitimate. So see, I look, some people say it's a green screen.

22
00:01:15.571 --> 00:01:17.430
Can't be a green screen. I'm wearing green right now.

23
00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:21.090
So that's a possible anyways, let's get this started.

24
00:01:21.091 --> 00:01:25.740
Shall we okay. Up? Not the right page.

25
00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:28.710
We'll edit that out. Ladies and gentlemen,

26
00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:32.460
this is a man trying to hide behind a white presentation and he's about to get

27
00:01:32.461 --> 00:01:36.630
destroyed. Let me set this up. Let me set the stage. So this is Dragon's den.

28
00:01:36.690 --> 00:01:40.290
It's like shark tank. If you know it from the U S basically people come on,

29
00:01:40.410 --> 00:01:43.920
they pitch their investment ideas to actual investors who have run real

30
00:01:43.921 --> 00:01:44.754
businesses.

31
00:01:44.910 --> 00:01:47.850
I'm not saying those investors are perfect because we've talked about some of

32
00:01:47.851 --> 00:01:52.110
their shady business dealings, but in this case, justice is about to be served,

33
00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:53.760
not to be served real nice.

34
00:01:56.870 --> 00:02:00.530
<v 1>Hello dragons. My name is Andy [inaudible] and I'm from Brampton, Ontario.</v>

35
00:02:01.790 --> 00:02:06.650
I stand humbly before you today to offer you a historical business

36
00:02:06.710 --> 00:02:07.543
opportunity.

37
00:02:10.640 --> 00:02:13.740
<v 0>Already off to a bad start. Why the big breath? Okay.</v>

38
00:02:15.050 --> 00:02:16.790
<v 1>Orange money. You're looking for any, I'm looking for</v>

39
00:02:18.410 --> 00:02:23.060
175,000 of your hard earned dollars, which works out to $35,000 per dragon.

40
00:02:23.630 --> 00:02:26.420
As I would like all five of you on board. What do we get?

41
00:02:26.421 --> 00:02:30.920
How much of the company, uh, if you could please let me finish my pitch. Uh,

42
00:02:30.930 --> 00:02:33.440
I will lead up to it. I have important information.

43
00:02:33.441 --> 00:02:37.250
It's not a product that I'm selling. Okay, go ahead. Thank you very much. Ma'am.

44
00:02:38.630 --> 00:02:42.020
<v 0>This guy, the balls on this guy already. How do you go?</v>

45
00:02:42.980 --> 00:02:46.070
They're investing in you. You don't go. Hey, sir. Please shut up.

46
00:02:46.160 --> 00:02:48.350
I'll take questions at the end of this presentation.

47
00:02:49.970 --> 00:02:54.680
<v 1>Oh, nice. Arlene. I would like all five of you on board in exchange,</v>

48
00:02:54.681 --> 00:02:58.580
you will get a business package within our rapidly growing company.

49
00:02:59.410 --> 00:03:03.220
Does business package will be responsible in the near future for bringing you

50
00:03:03.221 --> 00:03:04.450
huge returns.

51
00:03:07.470 --> 00:03:10.230
<v 0>That's the face that I'm giving right now. Buzzword buzzword,</v>

52
00:03:10.231 --> 00:03:11.370
buzzword business package.

53
00:03:11.400 --> 00:03:16.020
Buzzword buzzword will get huge returns buzzword in the next earnings quarter.

54
00:03:16.710 --> 00:03:20.190
Uh, where's the talk about equity? What are your sales?

55
00:03:20.250 --> 00:03:21.660
What's the real business.

56
00:03:22.530 --> 00:03:25.770
<v 1>This is going to reward you with a lot of money in the future.</v>

57
00:03:30.540 --> 00:03:31.350
<v 2>[Inaudible].</v>

58
00:03:31.350 --> 00:03:35.520
<v 1>Instead of all these reward points cards with clutter and restriction</v>

59
00:03:36.090 --> 00:03:37.380
with one card,

60
00:03:37.381 --> 00:03:42.060
Linus guarantees you cash back into your bank account.

61
00:03:42.330 --> 00:03:47.010
After your routine purchases, how much, what percentage? Uh,

62
00:03:47.040 --> 00:03:50.880
it can vary. It can go from 20 to 40%. Wait a sec.

63
00:03:51.150 --> 00:03:55.770
I go buy something. I get 20% of, yeah, that doesn't happen. That's not real.

64
00:03:55.830 --> 00:03:59.220
The purchase value in cash. Yes, sir. That ain't going to happen.

65
00:03:59.310 --> 00:04:03.750
You got to explain that further. Cause that's absolutely keep going. So the way.

66
00:04:03.780 --> 00:04:05.130
Thank you, sir. You should be sweating.

67
00:04:05.700 --> 00:04:07.470
<v 0>Dude. Do you guys see, do you guys see this?</v>

68
00:04:07.560 --> 00:04:10.350
Do you guys see the sweat on this man's brow here?

69
00:04:15.030 --> 00:04:18.270
This is why the name shark tank is actually a lot better than Dragon's den

70
00:04:18.510 --> 00:04:22.020
because dragons, you know, sharks smell blood in the water they pounce.

71
00:04:22.230 --> 00:04:25.110
And they're about to rip this guy to shreds. Poor, man.

72
00:04:25.260 --> 00:04:28.290
I feel bad for him cause I don't, I don't even think he's at the top of this.

73
00:04:29.760 --> 00:04:34.260
<v 1>The way it works is that, uh, the shoppers sign up and register for free.</v>

74
00:04:35.040 --> 00:04:40.020
And Excuse me,

75
00:04:40.021 --> 00:04:42.870
I'm just so nervous. I know this is going to end badly for you.

76
00:04:42.871 --> 00:04:43.704
I want you to know that.

77
00:04:47.040 --> 00:04:48.690
<v 2>Can we make that a meme in our community?</v>

78
00:04:50.130 --> 00:04:52.260
<v 0>As soon as we get catch them red flags, it's like,</v>

79
00:04:53.190 --> 00:04:56.640
I know this is going to end badly for you. I want you to know that.

80
00:04:57.120 --> 00:04:58.680
<v 1>I know this is going to end badly for you.</v>

81
00:04:58.681 --> 00:05:02.430
I want you to know that I want you to let this core man get his pituitary badly.

82
00:05:02.460 --> 00:05:05.100
Probably not. I got to know how I get 20% off my retail purchase.

83
00:05:05.760 --> 00:05:06.690
<v 2>We let him talk.</v>

84
00:05:09.780 --> 00:05:10.740
<v 0>I, you know what?</v>

85
00:05:10.741 --> 00:05:14.640
I see these things a lot where like the hosts are not sweating at all.

86
00:05:14.641 --> 00:05:19.140
And then the other guy is the whole time is like sweating

87
00:05:19.141 --> 00:05:22.350
profusely. I think it's a trick of the lights.

88
00:05:22.380 --> 00:05:26.640
I think they put the hot lights on the guy and then they have like cool fans on

89
00:05:26.641 --> 00:05:27.474
the hosts.

90
00:05:27.900 --> 00:05:32.040
Cause nobody normally sweats this much as you'll see in the next clip too.

91
00:05:32.160 --> 00:05:33.390
This isn't just this guy.

92
00:05:33.780 --> 00:05:36.150
All the people pitching they're like sweating profusely.

93
00:05:36.151 --> 00:05:37.740
And I don't think it's just nerves,

94
00:05:41.130 --> 00:05:44.070
Which by the way is genius on the producer's part. If that's true.

95
00:05:50.010 --> 00:05:54.720
<v 1>The shoppers register for free and a lioness partners</v>

96
00:05:54.721 --> 00:05:59.030
up with retailers to take a

97
00:05:59.480 --> 00:06:03.110
sales commission of the sales, they generate that particular.

98
00:06:03.430 --> 00:06:06.310
<v 0>I don't even think this guy knows what his own company does.</v>

99
00:06:06.610 --> 00:06:10.090
I don't think he's the owner of it. He doesn't sound like it. Like he doesn't,

100
00:06:10.120 --> 00:06:13.510
he isn't confident in what his own company does. This is what all the MLM is.

101
00:06:13.511 --> 00:06:15.550
Do you ask them what their company does? They're like, well,

102
00:06:15.551 --> 00:06:17.980
we have a distribution chain of logistics.

103
00:06:18.190 --> 00:06:22.090
If you get to the right tier and you get that, the override,

104
00:06:22.270 --> 00:06:25.090
it's going to go ahead and get you rich. They don't understand that.

105
00:06:25.630 --> 00:06:28.690
<v 1>A retailer, depending on their profit margin,</v>

106
00:06:29.650 --> 00:06:32.950
just like a commission-based salesman in a company.

107
00:06:34.480 --> 00:06:38.530
I get it. I don't get it. I get it. I don't get it. I'm going to,

108
00:06:38.590 --> 00:06:40.780
I'm going to try to explain to you in a simple term,

109
00:06:40.810 --> 00:06:45.550
if I can help you sign us up and then the deal is we should go sign up other

110
00:06:45.551 --> 00:06:49.210
people, right? Absolutely sign up other people's medical pyramid scheme.

111
00:06:50.260 --> 00:06:53.380
We're eight years old, uh, in Europe.

112
00:06:54.220 --> 00:06:57.100
<v 0>Dead stop. Don't hurt yourself. Bye.</v>

113
00:06:57.340 --> 00:07:00.400
<v 1>And a pyramid scheme falls up part at the bottom, correct?</v>

114
00:07:01.450 --> 00:07:03.370
Cause every time you move to the top,

115
00:07:04.330 --> 00:07:08.860
the supporters from this is the shoppers, which register for free.

116
00:07:09.490 --> 00:07:13.450
And they're motivated to go use their cards at all their mailers.

117
00:07:14.020 --> 00:07:18.190
I don't make any money. If someone signs up underneath me. Yes you do.

118
00:07:18.250 --> 00:07:23.080
I do absolutely. Oh, pyramid scheme. It's not a pyramid,

119
00:07:23.081 --> 00:07:25.330
large foot circling above your head.

120
00:07:27.880 --> 00:07:31.000
<v 0>This whole thing is just aroused. I mean, this should, honestly,</v>

121
00:07:31.030 --> 00:07:34.150
this is legal right here. This is manslaughter right now.

122
00:07:34.240 --> 00:07:36.610
This poor man is getting obliterated.

123
00:07:37.090 --> 00:07:38.290
<v 1>I think our business partner,</v>

124
00:07:38.680 --> 00:07:43.600
the one that I bought is $10,000 and nuts to start

125
00:07:43.601 --> 00:07:45.430
in Canada alone. Andy, how much.

126
00:07:46.120 --> 00:07:48.340
<v 0>Thousand dollars. That's ridiculous.</v>

127
00:07:48.940 --> 00:07:53.530
I've I've seen Emma limbs for like 500 bucks, 10 grand. This poor man.

128
00:07:54.010 --> 00:07:57.580
He hasn't made his money back. He he's this guy, guy's a lowly peon.

129
00:07:57.670 --> 00:07:59.370
I guarantee it. He acts like it.

130
00:08:00.280 --> 00:08:04.510
<v 1>Your money. Have you gotten now? Uh, so far I'm on my way, zero,</v>

131
00:08:04.511 --> 00:08:07.870
because I've been very busy. How many years ago did you give him the 10,000.

132
00:08:09.410 --> 00:08:14.050
<v 0>Sweating meme profusely? I feel bad for this guy at this point.</v>

133
00:08:14.080 --> 00:08:15.340
Now at this point,

134
00:08:15.341 --> 00:08:19.570
knowing what I know he's getting scammed and he's being humiliated all at the

135
00:08:19.571 --> 00:08:22.990
same time. So it is funny cause he's trying to scam other people,

136
00:08:22.991 --> 00:08:25.390
but he also is being scammed. Himself said,

137
00:08:25.391 --> 00:08:28.090
you find out in some of these things, it's like you're getting scammed,

138
00:08:28.091 --> 00:08:29.980
but you're also scamming other people. It's terrible.

139
00:08:31.240 --> 00:08:33.370
<v 1>Uh, basically it was in, in steps.</v>

140
00:08:33.371 --> 00:08:38.050
The last payment I made was about three months ago or I board, uh,

141
00:08:38.080 --> 00:08:40.570
money against my house. No.

142
00:08:40.990 --> 00:08:44.680
<v 0>No. Why would you do that? Don't ever borrow money against your house.</v>

143
00:08:44.681 --> 00:08:49.030
This isn't even a scam thing. This poor man has been hoodwinked and bamboozled.

144
00:08:49.300 --> 00:08:53.680
He went into the most aggressive entrepreneurs show to try to pitch the very

145
00:08:53.681 --> 00:08:57.270
idea that he got scammed into and to scam those people. And this is the face

146
00:09:00.090 --> 00:09:01.290
I gotta perfect that face.

147
00:09:01.350 --> 00:09:03.930
I gotta get on these one of these shark tanks sometime soon.

148
00:09:04.050 --> 00:09:07.740
Cause I guarantee you actually no cap. As the kids say,

149
00:09:08.070 --> 00:09:12.690
I'd be a great shark. I just sniff out all these con artists,

150
00:09:12.691 --> 00:09:14.880
liars, et cetera. I wouldn't let any of them through.

151
00:09:15.120 --> 00:09:18.330
And this is the face I'd be giving all of them just like that.

152
00:09:18.830 --> 00:09:22.700
<v 1>Hey, because the returns overpower any percentage of the returns coming.</v>

153
00:09:24.950 --> 00:09:29.210
The returns are when you give him 35,000, wait a second.

154
00:09:29.330 --> 00:09:32.600
Why would an investor give $10,000 to somebody and never get a return?

155
00:09:33.320 --> 00:09:35.960
<v 0>He's down. Stopped kicking this man while he's down.</v>

156
00:09:36.530 --> 00:09:39.140
<v 1>You're going to get a return. You're doing teed your returns.</v>

157
00:09:39.500 --> 00:09:41.330
As soon as you find your Ford direct.

158
00:09:41.930 --> 00:09:46.580
Oh boom. Ah, so.

159
00:09:49.190 --> 00:09:51.290
<v 0>Oh, we're starting off fakery Friday, right?</v>

160
00:09:51.291 --> 00:09:55.850
Boys hairless sweaty man is not the guru. It's the structure,

161
00:09:55.851 --> 00:09:59.480
the multilevel marketing structure, but I'm going to do it anyway. It's my show.

162
00:09:59.510 --> 00:10:03.230
So I guess this is Fager Friday. Lioness is the name of the scam, by the way,

163
00:10:03.231 --> 00:10:04.790
for those of you who are wondering,

164
00:10:04.791 --> 00:10:06.710
I don't know if I told you guys that in the beginning,

165
00:10:06.711 --> 00:10:08.480
I thought we were just going to find out together, but yeah.

166
00:10:08.840 --> 00:10:09.890
Little give back scam.

167
00:10:11.600 --> 00:10:16.100
<v 1>Did you buy this from my ex-wife in Europe? Honestly.</v>

168
00:10:19.610 --> 00:10:23.360
How much has she made? It's hard to say because it's in Hungarian, foreigns.

169
00:10:24.890 --> 00:10:27.380
<v 0>This poor man's life is falling apart. And Kevin Heller is like.</v>

170
00:10:28.310 --> 00:10:29.143
<v 1>Honestly,</v>

171
00:10:35.240 --> 00:10:38.840
I think the odds of you getting money from the dragons is pretty low. Got it.

172
00:10:39.110 --> 00:10:43.790
Why is that? It's a, it's a straightforward business. I mean, Andy Weir.

173
00:10:44.120 --> 00:10:48.920
Here's the way it works. Just simply they're losing us line us up here.

174
00:10:49.280 --> 00:10:50.810
Okay. Here's me.

175
00:10:51.170 --> 00:10:54.920
And here's the five dragons under me and there's a big foot above you about the

176
00:10:54.921 --> 00:10:58.250
squash because it's a really stupid idea.

177
00:11:00.170 --> 00:11:03.950
Hold on. Can you finish that analogy for me? So that it's you? Yes, here's,

178
00:11:04.490 --> 00:11:08.330
Lina's here's me. And here comes the five dragons underneath me. Got it.

179
00:11:08.480 --> 00:11:09.313
And they start.

180
00:11:09.500 --> 00:11:14.300
<v 0>And they each pay me $37,000 for the privilege of</v>

181
00:11:14.301 --> 00:11:16.130
joining a pyramid scheme. Yeah. That's going to work.

182
00:11:16.400 --> 00:11:19.250
<v 1>Their network bigger because everybody that you bring in,</v>

183
00:11:19.251 --> 00:11:21.440
they're going to bring in somebody here. Yes.

184
00:11:21.470 --> 00:11:24.310
And then it gets bigger and bigger and bigger and bigger.

185
00:11:24.470 --> 00:11:25.820
What did I just make handy?

186
00:11:28.460 --> 00:11:31.790
Can we get this nasty P word? The pyramid scheme.

187
00:11:34.400 --> 00:11:39.080
<v 0>So we started here. Oops, aha. And he's like,</v>

188
00:11:39.081 --> 00:11:43.940
yeah, yeah. What did I make Andy? Oh, this poor man.

189
00:11:44.540 --> 00:11:46.070
You got to feel bad for him. You do.

190
00:11:46.130 --> 00:11:50.930
<v 1>This is illegal. My friend. This is not something that I would ever invest in.</v>

191
00:11:50.960 --> 00:11:53.680
And neither should you have you have I'm out.

192
00:11:55.210 --> 00:11:59.530
<v 3>Yep. I don't know if it's a pyramid or not. It is. But my reaction is.</v>

193
00:12:00.210 --> 00:12:04.860
<v 0>Um, in my opinion, I'm looking at you lying as lawyers in my opinion.</v>

194
00:12:05.010 --> 00:12:07.020
Okay. Maybe it is. Maybe it isn't.

195
00:12:07.021 --> 00:12:09.450
That's why he said that actually is literally. So he doesn't get sued.

196
00:12:09.670 --> 00:12:14.160
<v 3>Not comfortable selling this to any of my friends while business</v>

197
00:12:14.161 --> 00:12:17.940
associates. So I'm out Eddie.

198
00:12:17.941 --> 00:12:21.390
I don't think you should take any more money and invested in this.

199
00:12:21.450 --> 00:12:23.640
It might not be a good idea. I'm out.

200
00:12:25.500 --> 00:12:28.770
Absolutely. No way. Would I put money into this?

201
00:12:29.250 --> 00:12:30.930
This stuff is distasteful.

202
00:12:32.700 --> 00:12:36.960
<v 0>Oh, that's a good one. Distasteful. So all right, finish this up.</v>

203
00:12:38.250 --> 00:12:41.760
<v 3>It doesn't impress me. I'm not impressed by the way.</v>

204
00:12:41.761 --> 00:12:45.690
It's operating as well. So for that reason I'm out.

205
00:12:49.290 --> 00:12:50.490
<v 0>Thank you. They'll take that with you.</v>

206
00:12:51.240 --> 00:12:56.040
You guys all see y'all all say when I'm worth a hundred million

207
00:12:56.041 --> 00:13:00.630
dollars and I've sold gift cards and credit card give backs to everybody in the

208
00:13:00.631 --> 00:13:04.260
entire world yells, see what you wear now,

209
00:13:04.440 --> 00:13:07.980
if you're like me and you just saw that guy get eviscerated on national

210
00:13:07.981 --> 00:13:11.730
television, I'd stay away. If you're one of these pyramid scheme guys,

211
00:13:12.360 --> 00:13:16.590
but not now the thing with pyramid scheme people, and this is the truth.

212
00:13:16.620 --> 00:13:20.580
This is honest. They believe in themselves like deep down to the core.

213
00:13:21.000 --> 00:13:23.430
They've been indoctrinated that this pyramid scheme is going to change the

214
00:13:23.431 --> 00:13:27.270
world. So they often, they don't see like what everyone else sees.

215
00:13:27.271 --> 00:13:29.760
And you're about to see that.

216
00:13:33.150 --> 00:13:33.983
<v 3>Oh.</v>

217
00:13:36.510 --> 00:13:38.520
<v 0>This is already off to a bad start.</v>

218
00:13:38.670 --> 00:13:41.610
When you look like you're about to try to revive Frankenstein with your little

219
00:13:41.611 --> 00:13:45.660
science experiment from the third grade, this is not going to go well.

220
00:13:45.690 --> 00:13:47.880
There's nothing sexy about what I'm seeing right now.

221
00:13:49.260 --> 00:13:54.030
<v 3>Hello dragons. My name is Paul Lobo. This is Barry Richie.</v>

222
00:13:54.240 --> 00:13:57.690
Okay. Our company is air Oasis limited.

223
00:13:58.590 --> 00:14:03.090
The purpose of us being here is we want 125,000 pounds of your money

224
00:14:03.420 --> 00:14:07.410
and return. We will give you 10% equity in our company.

225
00:14:08.100 --> 00:14:11.400
Our product produces water out of air,

226
00:14:12.090 --> 00:14:14.070
and Barry's not going to give you a brief.

227
00:14:14.400 --> 00:14:16.740
<v 0>So it's a dehumidifier.</v>

228
00:14:16.860 --> 00:14:19.530
Like if thing that we existed already,

229
00:14:20.460 --> 00:14:22.590
ambitious plans for market penetration,

230
00:14:22.920 --> 00:14:27.870
buried Richie and Paul Luba pitch for 125,000 pounds of investment in

231
00:14:27.871 --> 00:14:31.350
their company. Aero Oasis. Certainly hasn't lacked confidence,

232
00:14:31.680 --> 00:14:35.880
but what's behind it. Confident claims see per fetus wants to know.

233
00:14:38.370 --> 00:14:42.540
<v 3>Well unfair. I lost about seven P a liter. Yes.</v>

234
00:14:43.020 --> 00:14:46.230
Sounds cheap when you compare it with bottled water. Yes,

235
00:14:46.260 --> 00:14:50.970
but it's not cheap when you compare it to just filter because there's

236
00:14:51.350 --> 00:14:54.320
like that. Just fill tags. If that's without question, without question,

237
00:14:54.350 --> 00:14:57.350
the difference is these don't need a water supply.

238
00:14:57.560 --> 00:15:01.580
So they will be very good in humid countries without question where,

239
00:15:01.581 --> 00:15:05.750
where you can't get water to a unit. Most definitely.

240
00:15:05.990 --> 00:15:07.160
So the UK market,

241
00:15:07.250 --> 00:15:09.500
it's not actually going to be a very good market for this as it.

242
00:15:09.830 --> 00:15:12.350
What I think is actually there's a lot of people that are interested in reducing

243
00:15:12.351 --> 00:15:13.120
their car.

244
00:15:13.120 --> 00:15:17.770
<v 0>No, no, no, no. [inaudible] I can already tell who the salesman is.</v>

245
00:15:17.771 --> 00:15:19.900
The guy talking right now, not this guy, that guy talking,

246
00:15:20.290 --> 00:15:23.140
he's the salesman who everything always fits his product.

247
00:15:23.530 --> 00:15:27.070
Like you come out of the store and he's like, Oh, do you need a mattress?

248
00:15:27.100 --> 00:15:28.830
And you're like, Oh no, I already have a bed. And he goes, no, no,

249
00:15:28.831 --> 00:15:31.120
no mattresses are great for people that already have beds. And you're like, no,

250
00:15:31.121 --> 00:15:33.370
no. I just bought a mattress yesterday. He's like, actually,

251
00:15:33.371 --> 00:15:35.490
this mattress is great for people who just bought a mattress yesterday.

252
00:15:35.520 --> 00:15:38.770
You're like, no, this doesn't fit what I need right now.

253
00:15:39.430 --> 00:15:42.820
<v 3>And what is it costing you to buy these they're coming into me. Oh.</v>

254
00:15:43.750 --> 00:15:47.170
<v 0>Oh, the sweat begins again.</v>

255
00:15:47.171 --> 00:15:51.160
I'm telling you they have heaters on these people so that they sweat during the

256
00:15:51.161 --> 00:15:55.750
presentation. I know it because this is not a normal amount of human, sweat,

257
00:15:56.350 --> 00:15:58.630
salary and pool, a confidence of healthy margins.

258
00:15:59.080 --> 00:16:02.710
But Duncan Bannatyne thinks he's spotted a floor in that plant.

259
00:16:05.410 --> 00:16:06.580
<v 3>No, it's terrible. I don't like it, but it's shorter.</v>

260
00:16:06.581 --> 00:16:08.380
It says something you said in your pitch.

261
00:16:08.530 --> 00:16:11.050
What you're going to do is educate the public.

262
00:16:11.530 --> 00:16:13.330
You haven't explained how are you going to educate the public?

263
00:16:13.540 --> 00:16:14.800
And you're not going to educate the public.

264
00:16:15.430 --> 00:16:18.670
The public are going to continue using tap water or drinking, bottled water.

265
00:16:18.970 --> 00:16:22.660
Yep. Duncan. Um, soon as you do this test, which is very visual,

266
00:16:24.010 --> 00:16:27.070
really? That's the education. You can't travel around the country,

267
00:16:27.100 --> 00:16:28.270
knocking on people's doors.

268
00:16:29.830 --> 00:16:32.320
<v 0>Look at how arrogant this hand raises.</v>

269
00:16:32.500 --> 00:16:34.540
I've never seen something worse than this.

270
00:16:34.570 --> 00:16:39.250
I would never invest in somebody who has this face on this is the smuggest face

271
00:16:39.251 --> 00:16:43.390
I've ever seen. And I know it's London or the UK, but this is pretty bad.

272
00:16:43.420 --> 00:16:44.290
Even for you guys.

273
00:16:44.530 --> 00:16:47.890
<v 3>And people's doors going in with two glasses of water and sending people look at</v>

274
00:16:47.980 --> 00:16:50.590
the difference by one of these machines, you can't do that.

275
00:16:50.620 --> 00:16:52.780
That's we can can't educate the public.

276
00:16:53.650 --> 00:16:56.440
We've just got a hundred kits in little cases.

277
00:16:56.441 --> 00:17:00.010
This is like the Kirby vacuum cleaner. This is the bugs under them on the bed.

278
00:17:00.011 --> 00:17:00.970
Under the microscope,

279
00:17:01.090 --> 00:17:05.380
we've got 300 people sign up to go out door to door on commission. Only

280
00:17:07.090 --> 00:17:10.930
mother buddy. The point I'm making isn't that you can't grow knocking on doors.

281
00:17:11.080 --> 00:17:14.440
The point I'm making is you can't afford to go around knocking on doors.

282
00:17:17.050 --> 00:17:21.580
<v 0>Hold off. No, actually let me make this more accurate. Kinda get a little,</v>

283
00:17:22.900 --> 00:17:26.710
a little water here. Hold on. It's going to be too much. All right. No,

284
00:17:26.830 --> 00:17:27.663
it's good.

285
00:17:31.600 --> 00:17:35.320
Oh really? Really? I can't do it really. Huh?

286
00:17:36.880 --> 00:17:39.460
<v 3>There's not enough. Money it to go knocking on doors and saying to people, look,</v>

287
00:17:39.850 --> 00:17:40.571
where are you like me? Come in.

288
00:17:40.571 --> 00:17:42.650
It should use two glasses of water and show the difference. It ain't.

289
00:17:42.700 --> 00:17:44.230
You can buy my machine for 500 quid.

290
00:17:44.590 --> 00:17:47.470
But there is because that doesn't cost them. And we bought all the kits.

291
00:17:47.620 --> 00:17:50.340
The people are taken on a part-time only basis.

292
00:17:50.490 --> 00:17:54.060
They get a hundred pounds a sale. They do three in a week. They get 150%.

293
00:17:54.240 --> 00:17:56.970
It's good. Old fashioned pyramid. Multi-level direct Mark.

294
00:17:58.520 --> 00:18:02.960
<v 0>Uh, oops. You know, you see God himself. It's good.</v>

295
00:18:02.961 --> 00:18:06.620
Old fashioned pyramid scheme, multi, uh,

296
00:18:08.060 --> 00:18:08.840
multi-level uh.

297
00:18:08.840 --> 00:18:10.820
<v 3>Being awake. They get it's good. Old fashioned pyramid.</v>

298
00:18:11.420 --> 00:18:12.253
Multi-level direct markets.

299
00:18:14.480 --> 00:18:17.000
<v 0>Did you see, Oh gosh,</v>

300
00:18:17.030 --> 00:18:19.220
I have to explain something for you guys to fully get the context of this

301
00:18:19.520 --> 00:18:22.370
pyramid. It used to be called pyramid selling. Then they rebranded it.

302
00:18:22.371 --> 00:18:25.040
After everyone realized that was the scam to multi-level marketing.

303
00:18:25.250 --> 00:18:28.160
Everyone realized that was a scam. So they renamed it to direct selling.

304
00:18:28.370 --> 00:18:32.600
This guy has been in the game so long that he goes through fluidly,

305
00:18:32.660 --> 00:18:36.170
all three words for it seamlessly. Oh, this is incredible.

306
00:18:38.660 --> 00:18:42.140
<v 3>Price. I was the top salesman.</v>

307
00:18:44.090 --> 00:18:49.010
<v 4>You run the risk of talking yourself back down those days without an investment.</v>

308
00:18:49.790 --> 00:18:50.270
Okay.

309
00:18:50.270 --> 00:18:55.100
The reason I asked if you'd been a Kirby selling person is that I could have

310
00:18:55.101 --> 00:18:58.460
told you where, because actually what you used to do is done in people's room,

311
00:18:58.461 --> 00:19:02.240
bombard them and barrage them exactly the way you're trying to do with us now,

312
00:19:02.480 --> 00:19:05.690
until they capitulate and buy that carpet cleaner.

313
00:19:05.930 --> 00:19:10.250
I've seen the selling techniques, which I have to say really, really annoys me.

314
00:19:10.730 --> 00:19:11.930
Uh, you are talking about.

315
00:19:12.740 --> 00:19:15.530
<v 0>This. Guy's confidence is slowly diminishing.</v>

316
00:19:15.531 --> 00:19:20.300
If you see the face is getting sweaty or both of ours are,

317
00:19:20.630 --> 00:19:23.180
and uh, the confidence is going away.

318
00:19:23.330 --> 00:19:25.790
The smugness going away didn't have all the answers.

319
00:19:26.390 --> 00:19:31.250
<v 4>But a pyramid selling scheme. I've got to tell you for me,</v>

320
00:19:31.251 --> 00:19:35.400
that is a combination that I would run a mile from. Okay?

321
00:19:36.170 --> 00:19:39.740
So I have no reason to invest. I might click.

322
00:19:41.690 --> 00:19:43.700
<v 5>The atmosphere in the Dennis darkening,</v>

323
00:19:43.940 --> 00:19:46.970
a furious Deborah Meaden wants nothing to do with the duo.

324
00:19:47.390 --> 00:19:50.450
And she's not the only dragon to be alienated by the pitch.

325
00:19:55.310 --> 00:19:56.600
As a business proposition.

326
00:19:57.380 --> 00:20:00.500
<v 3>Does this excite me for 150,000 pounds?</v>

327
00:20:00.890 --> 00:20:04.820
No working with Barry would just drive me crazy.

328
00:20:05.300 --> 00:20:08.900
I don't think I could handle it. And for those reasons, guys, I'm out.

329
00:20:12.620 --> 00:20:16.550
<v 0>There's guys getting eviscerated and nobody's coming to save them.</v>

330
00:20:16.580 --> 00:20:17.600
That's my favorite part.

331
00:20:18.320 --> 00:20:23.090
<v 3>Dragons around pool. How do you work with this guy? Um, very well. Um,</v>

332
00:20:23.150 --> 00:20:26.570
I love his enthusiasm. No, no, no. I, I get Barry.

333
00:20:26.900 --> 00:20:30.320
I don't get you leave everything. Barry says no, not at all.

334
00:20:31.670 --> 00:20:33.800
Two men and a business. Always agree. One of them is unnecessary.

335
00:20:34.590 --> 00:20:36.770
<v 0>I only see one unnecessary man here.</v>

336
00:20:37.460 --> 00:20:41.210
<v 3>How much money have you made? Have you got money to put into it? Yes, I have.</v>

337
00:20:41.211 --> 00:20:45.920
I put, I put in 150,000 pounds. So you put it in 150,000 of your own cash.

338
00:20:45.950 --> 00:20:50.440
Yes. And Barry, I'm about 50 at about a million and a hard work.

339
00:20:52.140 --> 00:20:56.940
<v 0>This man is so sassy. Can I just say Adam out of value and of hard work,</v>

340
00:20:57.090 --> 00:20:58.620
relax, dude. Yes.

341
00:21:00.020 --> 00:21:03.510
You got to have the right partner in a partnership and Barry's not cutting it.

342
00:21:03.900 --> 00:21:05.820
I got to say, have you got any more money?

343
00:21:06.120 --> 00:21:10.350
<v 3>Well, of course I've got more money. How much more money have you got? Well,</v>

344
00:21:10.470 --> 00:21:12.930
I don't think that concerns you. It does concern me.

345
00:21:13.140 --> 00:21:14.100
How much money have you got?

346
00:21:14.490 --> 00:21:15.900
<v 0>You're asking for an investment.</v>

347
00:21:16.080 --> 00:21:19.560
Of course it concerns him how much his investors have to put in the business

348
00:21:19.561 --> 00:21:22.290
that may be failing very soon. This is.

349
00:21:23.250 --> 00:21:24.930
<v 3>Probably about 10 million in the bank.</v>

350
00:21:25.130 --> 00:21:27.750
That's so I don't think that's a valid question. Well, I'll tell you why.

351
00:21:27.751 --> 00:21:29.670
It's a valid question. If you've got the money,

352
00:21:29.700 --> 00:21:34.320
why aren't you putting the blood? Let me, let us explain why we want your,

353
00:21:34.710 --> 00:21:38.760
your expertise, your knowledge, so that we can really go.

354
00:21:39.030 --> 00:21:41.700
But why should I give you money for you to get managed for me? Well,

355
00:21:41.701 --> 00:21:44.010
we're not a charity. We're not going to let you have a.

356
00:21:44.130 --> 00:21:46.320
<v 0>They're not a charity. They can look at this guy.</v>

357
00:21:47.850 --> 00:21:52.050
My face when gurus tried to pitch me a pyramid scheme on Dragon's den.

358
00:21:53.990 --> 00:21:56.970
<v 3>Well knowledge for me and my money. Absolutely. Exactly.</v>

359
00:21:58.410 --> 00:22:00.420
I haven't got mugged written over my forehead. You know?

360
00:22:02.040 --> 00:22:06.390
<v 0>Um, I don't know British, but I'm assuming that that's a bacon, salt mug.</v>

361
00:22:07.050 --> 00:22:10.380
I don't know my UK. Editor's going to have to explain that one. To me.

362
00:22:11.460 --> 00:22:13.440
<v 5>Aged Peter Jones has blasted the geo.</v>

363
00:22:13.800 --> 00:22:17.370
The dragons are clearly infuriated by the entrepreneurs themselves.

364
00:22:20.820 --> 00:22:21.090
<v 3>[Inaudible].</v>

365
00:22:21.090 --> 00:22:25.770
<v 5>Barry and Paul's only hope now is to salvage their pitch by proving their water</v>

366
00:22:25.771 --> 00:22:27.300
tastes as good as they say.

367
00:22:27.630 --> 00:22:31.470
<v 0>This is good. This is good. Reset the pitch. Yes, you're a pyramid scheme,</v>

368
00:22:31.471 --> 00:22:33.120
but maybe your pyramid scheme tastes great.

369
00:22:38.160 --> 00:22:39.420
<v 3>Buddy. It tastes terrible.</v>

370
00:22:41.040 --> 00:22:44.640
Terrible all this conversations, but not this sort of test in the war.

371
00:22:45.120 --> 00:22:49.270
Is that water that's cause it's warm. That's why unusual tastes. Oh.

372
00:22:49.650 --> 00:22:51.450
<v 0>No unusual taste.</v>

373
00:22:51.960 --> 00:22:56.010
That's a bad adjective for water. Unusual.

374
00:22:58.890 --> 00:23:02.340
<v 3>That'd be [inaudible]. There's something in it. There's nothing in it.</v>

375
00:23:02.640 --> 00:23:03.473
Or use your glass.

376
00:23:03.680 --> 00:23:07.350
<v 5>I drink all that water mayhem erupts in the den.</v>

377
00:23:07.950 --> 00:23:10.800
<v 0>You thought they were sweating before. It's just getting started.</v>

378
00:23:11.760 --> 00:23:12.593
<v 5>It's got an aftertaste.</v>

379
00:23:13.080 --> 00:23:17.730
The Dragon's declared Berry and water to be totally unpalatable revolting.

380
00:23:18.120 --> 00:23:21.150
My kids will throw that back at you. Theo per fetus.

381
00:23:22.590 --> 00:23:23.670
<v 0>Guys. I swear I can.</v>

382
00:23:26.010 --> 00:23:26.843
<v 5>Taste it.</v>

383
00:23:27.840 --> 00:23:30.210
<v 3>Terrible or not. It doesn't say it's terrible,</v>

384
00:23:30.211 --> 00:23:32.070
but it certainly doesn't taste as good as it should do.

385
00:23:33.660 --> 00:23:36.480
But it's a brand spanking new machine that needed to be flushed and everything

386
00:23:36.481 --> 00:23:37.314
else properly. This is.

387
00:23:37.410 --> 00:23:40.620
<v 0>It's a, brand's making new machine that doesn't work.</v>

388
00:23:41.490 --> 00:23:43.200
I don't know what's going on here, guys.

389
00:23:44.110 --> 00:23:46.190
<v 3>It needs to be set for a longer.</v>

390
00:23:46.190 --> 00:23:49.400
<v 5>Period of time in order to five hours to get it working properly.</v>

391
00:23:49.800 --> 00:23:53.650
<v 0>Was a temporary. Hey, I'll tell you how long it takes to get your tap water.</v>

392
00:23:53.710 --> 00:23:56.920
She's four to five hours.

393
00:23:57.580 --> 00:24:00.400
<v 5>Uh, 21 degrees. Just listen to me. They'll get really annoyed.</v>

394
00:24:00.401 --> 00:24:01.990
Now I'm complaining.

395
00:24:02.590 --> 00:24:03.423
<v 3>About the temperature,</v>

396
00:24:03.460 --> 00:24:07.840
but the fat has got a terrible appalling after taste.

397
00:24:08.020 --> 00:24:10.780
So don't make excuses about the temperature. I'm out.

398
00:24:12.910 --> 00:24:15.700
<v 5>It's all bits over for Barry and Paul. They,</v>

399
00:24:16.600 --> 00:24:20.260
it by Theo per fetus now Duncan Bannatyne and Peter Jones.

400
00:24:20.530 --> 00:24:22.150
Step forward to have their say.

401
00:24:23.630 --> 00:24:25.450
<v 3>The thing is w w what gets me is this,</v>

402
00:24:26.920 --> 00:24:31.120
you did all these tests and his war to shoot your war is the best. Yes, yes.

403
00:24:31.480 --> 00:24:35.830
Then I tested your water. Yes, yes. And it's rubbish. Yes. We all tested it.

404
00:24:36.100 --> 00:24:37.090
Most of the same thing. Yes.

405
00:24:37.180 --> 00:24:40.210
And then you said that's because that machine hasn't been flushed. Yes.

406
00:24:40.630 --> 00:24:45.430
In order for you to see our machine in its full

407
00:24:45.431 --> 00:24:49.270
operation, it would have been fair for this machine to be here overnight.

408
00:24:49.690 --> 00:24:51.220
Then it would have been where you've gone from.

409
00:24:51.250 --> 00:24:54.730
They would have gone from justice. You've gone from an hour and a half, Joel,

410
00:24:54.940 --> 00:24:59.530
Nate now, but it doesn't answer my question. Um, and you know,

411
00:24:59.531 --> 00:25:03.070
I'm not gonna invest in it. So I'm, uh, Paul Barry,

412
00:25:03.220 --> 00:25:07.150
you've basically bought a product here that lives or dies on the back of the

413
00:25:07.151 --> 00:25:11.860
quality that it produces. Can I say in all the times that we,

414
00:25:11.890 --> 00:25:15.760
he doesn't even make a point, he just goes of the quality that it produces.

415
00:25:18.530 --> 00:25:20.020
<v 5>Saying all the times.</v>

416
00:25:20.320 --> 00:25:24.280
<v 3>That we've tasted that water amongst you dragons.</v>

417
00:25:24.281 --> 00:25:26.740
That's the first time it's unfortunate being like this.

418
00:25:27.670 --> 00:25:28.503
That's all I can say to you.

419
00:25:30.410 --> 00:25:32.830
I think enough has been said by everybody else.

420
00:25:32.980 --> 00:25:36.430
And I don't think he hit necessarily to be insulted,

421
00:25:37.000 --> 00:25:39.310
so good luck in your endeavors,

422
00:25:39.400 --> 00:25:41.380
but I'm not going to invest in the business I'm out.

423
00:25:42.130 --> 00:25:44.650
<v 0>Okay. Okay. Fair enough. Barry.</v>

424
00:25:44.650 --> 00:25:46.540
<v 5>And Paul have felt the full force of.</v>

425
00:25:47.350 --> 00:25:50.670
<v 0>All right. And that's it guys. That's how you invest in,</v>

426
00:25:50.800 --> 00:25:55.000
or that's how you pitch a pyramid scheme on Dragon's den. Whew,

427
00:25:56.050 --> 00:26:00.940
rough. Even for me, get a little, get a fan in here. Uh,

428
00:26:00.970 --> 00:26:04.150
actually hold on. Think we can

429
00:26:06.580 --> 00:26:10.690
$10 million studio guys. We got fan technology. Uh, anyways,

430
00:26:10.750 --> 00:26:15.130
I hope you enjoy this lighthearted episode of fake guru Friday.

431
00:26:15.220 --> 00:26:19.210
In this case, the fake guru is pyramid schemes.

432
00:26:19.480 --> 00:26:22.720
And I guess the people getting scammed are the people investing in those pyramid

433
00:26:22.721 --> 00:26:26.470
schemes and taking them on these reality shows to be trashed in front of the

434
00:26:26.471 --> 00:26:30.730
entire world. I hope you learned your lesson guys. Don't do it again.

435
00:26:31.930 --> 00:26:36.730
Thank you for watching. Gosh, it feels good to be daily. Huh? It used to be,

436
00:26:36.731 --> 00:26:40.870
I took the weekend off, but now, Hey, see you tomorrow.
