00:00:03.410 --> 00:00:07.700
<v 1>Ladies and gentlemen, this is day one of retirement and I am miserable.</v>

2
00:00:07.701 --> 00:00:11.750
I don't think I can remember a time where I was more bored out of my mind.

3
00:00:12.230 --> 00:00:14.450
I don't know what you're supposed to do in retirement,

4
00:00:14.451 --> 00:00:18.650
but I'm pretty sure this is not it. See, I looked it up on Google.

5
00:00:18.890 --> 00:00:20.360
That was my first mistake. Quite frankly,

6
00:00:20.361 --> 00:00:23.360
I think they're about to get shut down by the FTC or monopoly laws.

7
00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:24.233
That's what I get.

8
00:00:24.980 --> 00:00:26.960
It says retire on a cruise ship with less than a million dollars.

9
00:00:26.961 --> 00:00:30.020
And obviously I'm broke. And I said, Oh, cruise ships sound kind of nice.

10
00:00:30.021 --> 00:00:33.050
This time of year, nothing really happened to affect them, right? I mean,

11
00:00:33.051 --> 00:00:37.220
some people say the cruise ships are very nice to be on and those,

12
00:00:37.221 --> 00:00:39.560
some people are complete idiots. Guys.

13
00:00:39.561 --> 00:00:42.200
I'm here to share with you some of my footage and it's miserable.

14
00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:44.390
As you can see almost no one's here. You know what it is?

15
00:00:44.391 --> 00:00:48.020
Cruise ships are a glorified hotel. That's what it is. That's all it is.

16
00:00:48.050 --> 00:00:52.490
They have bad food, but it's free. They have a pooled at the same tin drunk.

17
00:00:52.520 --> 00:00:55.610
People are always in and they have a room that smells like that weird

18
00:00:55.611 --> 00:00:59.510
combination of human waste and Clorox. And that's about it, guys.

19
00:00:59.540 --> 00:01:03.020
That's really about it. It's all really cruises have to offer for you. Actually,

20
00:01:03.021 --> 00:01:05.930
I did think of a difference. You can leave a best Western.

21
00:01:06.110 --> 00:01:07.670
You're not going to leave your carnival.

22
00:01:08.510 --> 00:01:10.370
And then the cruise ship just has rooms like this,

23
00:01:10.371 --> 00:01:12.350
which I don't know what the hell this is supposed to be.

24
00:01:12.860 --> 00:01:16.760
Is this the weird room where Epstein sacrificed the young boys? This is strange,

25
00:01:17.330 --> 00:01:20.240
but probably the worst part of all of this is you can't get a decent cup of

26
00:01:20.241 --> 00:01:24.230
coffee, guys. This copy is so weak. So old. I had to ask, you know,

27
00:01:24.231 --> 00:01:27.350
what type of coffee is it? Who, who makes this kind of coffee?

28
00:01:27.830 --> 00:01:32.150
They show me this guys. It's Joe Biden's coffee. I mean, no wonder it's weak.

29
00:01:32.151 --> 00:01:32.871
Right? And you know,

30
00:01:32.871 --> 00:01:36.170
another problem is it's been like 24 hours since I've called someone out on

31
00:01:36.171 --> 00:01:39.920
social media. And, um, you know,

32
00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:42.950
getting the little bit of this shakes. I thought this would be easier to kick.

33
00:01:43.610 --> 00:01:45.920
As I honestly think cruises are just a total waste of time.

34
00:01:45.921 --> 00:01:48.530
And I think the rest of the world is like realizing that too. I mean,

35
00:01:48.531 --> 00:01:52.790
look how much like the carnival cruise line just crashed recently because it's

36
00:01:52.791 --> 00:01:55.010
terrible. Who would want to do this? I hate it.

37
00:01:55.070 --> 00:01:59.000
I'm ready to go back to work guys. I can't, I can't do this anymore. In fact,

38
00:01:59.480 --> 00:02:03.140
I don't even think I'm going to last through today, guys. I think,

39
00:02:05.090 --> 00:02:06.860
I think I'm going to go back to the office right now.

40
00:02:09.470 --> 00:02:10.520
<v 0>Thanks for watching that video.</v>

41
00:02:11.010 --> 00:02:13.790
<v 1>Want to be happy? Unlike me, you can go watch wills, coders,</v>

42
00:02:13.850 --> 00:02:17.450
new series on happiness. He just uploaded it. The secret to happier.

43
00:02:17.451 --> 00:02:20.900
He's a good friend of mine and he put an insane amount of work into this here.

44
00:02:20.901 --> 00:02:22.580
