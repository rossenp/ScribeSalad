00:00:00.330 --> 00:00:02.880
<v 0>Ladies and gentlemen, welcome to another episode where I keep my hair today.</v>

2
00:00:02.881 --> 00:00:05.940
We have throwback, Thursdays, hope you have something to drink. Uh, something,

3
00:00:05.941 --> 00:00:09.090
a little stepper. Cause we're talking about a very serious topic today.

4
00:00:10.860 --> 00:00:15.150
Napoleon Hill guys, this is a sort of the Moby Dick of gurus.

5
00:00:15.300 --> 00:00:19.380
He's the big white whale that most people don't even know is lurking under the

6
00:00:19.381 --> 00:00:19.861
surface.

7
00:00:19.861 --> 00:00:24.450
He's influenced more business gurus than you could probably imagine.

8
00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:28.170
In fact, Tony Robbins, it's one of his top five books of all time.

9
00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:32.250
He's influenced Dan Locke. Have you read the book? Ty Lopez,

10
00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:35.640
have you read this book, Bob Proctor, just see,

11
00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:39.450
this is the first book I ever read sink and grow rich by Napoleon Hill.

12
00:00:39.630 --> 00:00:43.200
I'd never read a book before that chances are, if you have a business guy,

13
00:00:43.201 --> 00:00:47.490
you follow he's read Napoleon Hill and he thinks he's the absolute,

14
00:00:48.150 --> 00:00:52.680
just listen to this YouTube or summarize sort of the popularized story of

15
00:00:52.681 --> 00:00:53.550
Napoleon Hill.

16
00:00:54.470 --> 00:00:56.600
<v 1>What's going on guys. As many of you know,</v>

17
00:00:56.601 --> 00:00:59.900
one of my favorite books in personal development is think and grow rich.

18
00:01:00.140 --> 00:01:03.170
That book was catalyzed as a result of Napoleon Hill,

19
00:01:03.171 --> 00:01:05.450
the author meeting Andrew Carnegie,

20
00:01:05.480 --> 00:01:09.710
who was the wealthiest man in the world at the time Carnegie basically charged

21
00:01:09.740 --> 00:01:13.040
Napoleon Hill with interviewing a number of successful people,

22
00:01:13.041 --> 00:01:17.510
almost 200 people and extracting the principles that allowed them to do their

23
00:01:17.511 --> 00:01:18.344
life's work.

24
00:01:18.850 --> 00:01:21.140
<v 0>All right. That's pretty amazing. Actually,</v>

25
00:01:21.141 --> 00:01:25.460
you have this guy who was broke at the time, Napoleon Hill, a journalist,

26
00:01:25.490 --> 00:01:30.350
apparently who got allowed into the inner chambers of Andrew Carnegie

27
00:01:30.351 --> 00:01:32.030
for a long three hour interview.

28
00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:36.170
And he ends up basically committing the Polian Hill with his most important

29
00:01:36.171 --> 00:01:39.920
work, passing down his knowledge, the Polian Hill repeats.

30
00:01:40.730 --> 00:01:44.000
<v 2>When I first heard Andrew Carnegie described this Metro law,</v>

31
00:01:44.030 --> 00:01:48.740
which makes it possible for you and I and everyone else to write his own price

32
00:01:48.980 --> 00:01:50.090
tag and life. I entertain it.

33
00:01:50.330 --> 00:01:54.530
My search led me to the study of the spiritual forces with which all of us are

34
00:01:54.531 --> 00:01:57.980
blessed. And it was in this field that I came upon.

35
00:01:58.100 --> 00:02:02.390
It painted while I was being coached by Andrew Carnegie,

36
00:02:02.420 --> 00:02:05.510
during the organization of the science of success philosophy.

37
00:02:06.260 --> 00:02:09.050
I had just finished telling Mr. Carnegie that I was scared.

38
00:02:09.051 --> 00:02:13.580
He had chosen the wrong person to give the world the first practical philosophy

39
00:02:13.581 --> 00:02:16.490
of personal success because of my youth,

40
00:02:17.030 --> 00:02:19.790
my lack of education and my lack of finances.

41
00:02:20.570 --> 00:02:24.860
<v 0>An incredible American story of somebody from a high</v>

42
00:02:25.100 --> 00:02:26.690
billionaire business class,

43
00:02:26.691 --> 00:02:31.460
reaching down and lifting someone up who is an unknown writer pass on his

44
00:02:31.461 --> 00:02:35.090
greatest wisdom, except it probably never happened.

45
00:02:47.810 --> 00:02:49.640
Okay. So why do I say that?

46
00:02:49.970 --> 00:02:54.650
How could I claim that this man whose entire life's work is built off of this

47
00:02:54.710 --> 00:02:57.890
incredible chance meeting with Andrew Carnegie and passing down all his

48
00:02:57.891 --> 00:03:02.320
information? How could I, that he did not meet him? Well, for starters,

49
00:03:02.650 --> 00:03:05.200
they apparently met early in the 19 hundreds,

50
00:03:05.530 --> 00:03:10.270
but he didn't start telling the story until after Andrew Carnegie died.

51
00:03:10.780 --> 00:03:12.910
He didn't share the story that they had met together.

52
00:03:13.420 --> 00:03:17.440
And the proof of Andrew Carnegie actually meeting with them. Well,

53
00:03:17.920 --> 00:03:20.440
apparently he had all their letters together, but, uh,

54
00:03:21.040 --> 00:03:25.990
according to his own biographers, they got lost in a fire. Unfortunately,

55
00:03:25.991 --> 00:03:30.070
all the letters. Yeah. And they burned away. Now at this point,

56
00:03:30.340 --> 00:03:33.580
I'm getting a little bit of Evan Luther vibes. If you guys don't know,

57
00:03:33.610 --> 00:03:38.200
that's someone I interviewed before who claimed he was mentored by Steve jobs.

58
00:03:38.800 --> 00:03:41.830
I see your mentor or not. Let's just dance to that question with a yes or no.

59
00:03:42.250 --> 00:03:44.650
I think I would like to say yes later when I pressured him on this,

60
00:03:44.890 --> 00:03:47.800
he admitted that actually he had never talked to Steve jobs at all.

61
00:03:47.801 --> 00:03:50.440
And instead he meant mentored in the sense of,

62
00:03:50.441 --> 00:03:52.630
he had been inspired by Steve jobs.

63
00:03:52.720 --> 00:03:57.190
I have a little trouble believing that because on our call, I think yesterday,

64
00:03:57.191 --> 00:04:00.160
you said you were not mentored by Steve jobs and that you never said that.

65
00:04:00.630 --> 00:04:03.390
<v 4>I never said Steve jobs that I've mentioned by the way, it doesn't,</v>

66
00:04:03.391 --> 00:04:07.530
you don't have to talk to somebody all the time to consider them your mentor.

67
00:04:07.920 --> 00:04:11.250
I would like to believe that the internet has been my biggest mentor.

68
00:04:11.910 --> 00:04:14.040
<v 0>Kind of like Napoleon Hill.</v>

69
00:04:14.070 --> 00:04:18.420
It seems because there's absolutely no evidence that he ever met with Andrew

70
00:04:18.421 --> 00:04:21.990
Carnegie. Even if you believe that it was lost in a fire,

71
00:04:22.080 --> 00:04:26.280
we can compare Napoleon Hill's writings about Andrew Carnegie with Andrew

72
00:04:26.281 --> 00:04:28.590
Carnegie's own writing. In fact,

73
00:04:28.620 --> 00:04:32.460
Andrew Carnegie's owned biographer doubts that they ever met at all. He says,

74
00:04:32.490 --> 00:04:36.270
let me put it this way. I found no evidence that the book was authentic.

75
00:04:36.840 --> 00:04:40.830
So this man built an entire career on this alleged meeting of the minds with

76
00:04:40.831 --> 00:04:44.280
Andrew Carnegie and all these wealthy people. But there's no proof of it.

77
00:04:44.370 --> 00:04:48.390
And Andrew Carnegie's owned. Biographer says, yeah, it didn't happen. But guys,

78
00:04:48.391 --> 00:04:49.560
we can reach deeper than that.

79
00:04:49.710 --> 00:04:52.800
We don't have to simply rely on this guy's opinion,

80
00:04:52.980 --> 00:04:56.130
who he just the biographer of Andrew Carnegie. So we have two books.

81
00:04:56.131 --> 00:04:56.910
We're going to look at.

82
00:04:56.910 --> 00:05:01.410
One is Napoleon Hill's account of his conversation with Andrew Carnegie and two,

83
00:05:01.560 --> 00:05:04.080
we're going to actually look at Andrew Carnegie's biography.

84
00:05:04.380 --> 00:05:07.620
And we're going to look at one of his little mini books called the gospel of

85
00:05:07.621 --> 00:05:11.280
wealth. See, Andrew Carnegie actually wrote a lot.

86
00:05:11.310 --> 00:05:15.180
Despite what these ideas say that Andrew Carnegie needed a reporter to

87
00:05:15.181 --> 00:05:19.080
transcribe all his ideas down for a guy who was going to let someone else do the

88
00:05:19.081 --> 00:05:20.430
talking. He sure wrote a lot.

89
00:05:20.640 --> 00:05:24.750
So let's compare these two in Napoleon Hill's account of Andrew Carnegie

90
00:05:24.751 --> 00:05:27.300
Carnegie comes across like he's really,

91
00:05:27.510 --> 00:05:29.580
doesn't really feel bad for people who are poor,

92
00:05:29.581 --> 00:05:33.720
because really there's no injustice because just like the law of attraction

93
00:05:33.750 --> 00:05:34.201
States,

94
00:05:34.201 --> 00:05:37.800
which of course I think you guys should know by now is what Napoleon Hill came

95
00:05:37.801 --> 00:05:39.000
up with and thinking grow rich.

96
00:05:39.001 --> 00:05:41.700
You guys don't know that's what the secret was based off of.

97
00:05:41.760 --> 00:05:44.520
That's where all this stuff is inspired by, but he says here,

98
00:05:44.550 --> 00:05:45.450
understand this truth.

99
00:05:45.560 --> 00:05:48.720
And you will note that there's no injustice in connection with the difference

100
00:05:48.721 --> 00:05:51.900
between the fortunes, which mink accumulate. In other words,

101
00:05:52.230 --> 00:05:55.110
whether you're Andrew Carnegie or are you the guy working at McDonald's,

102
00:05:55.440 --> 00:05:56.700
you deserve what you get.

103
00:05:57.080 --> 00:06:00.500
They are where they are and they're drawing the wages they receive solely

104
00:06:00.501 --> 00:06:04.520
because of the limitations they have set up in their own minds. In other words,

105
00:06:04.521 --> 00:06:07.910
look, everybody could be rich. Look literally everybody.

106
00:06:08.150 --> 00:06:10.790
There's no problem with that. You just have to think about it.

107
00:06:10.791 --> 00:06:14.210
It's your mindset, your mindset's bad. Have you heard of that?

108
00:06:14.660 --> 00:06:16.040
But according to Andrew Carnegie,

109
00:06:16.130 --> 00:06:19.910
who sounds much more like a businessman than a self-help guru in his own book,

110
00:06:20.090 --> 00:06:20.960
gospel of wealth,

111
00:06:21.050 --> 00:06:24.560
he says that competition naturally creates inequality under the law of

112
00:06:24.561 --> 00:06:25.131
competition.

113
00:06:25.131 --> 00:06:29.390
The sh employer of thousands is forced into the strictest economies among which

114
00:06:29.391 --> 00:06:33.770
the rates paid to labor figure prominently and often there's friction between

115
00:06:33.771 --> 00:06:38.570
the employer and the employed between capital and labor between rich and

116
00:06:38.571 --> 00:06:41.900
poor sounds a little bit different, right? And wait a minute.

117
00:06:41.901 --> 00:06:45.500
That completely conflicts what Napoleon Hill says over here.

118
00:06:45.680 --> 00:06:48.980
I never set the wage scale of any man who works for me.

119
00:06:49.130 --> 00:06:53.060
That's supposedly Andrew Carnegie right there talking right there. You see that.

120
00:06:53.420 --> 00:06:55.970
But Andrew Carnegie in his own book, laments,

121
00:06:55.971 --> 00:06:59.000
the fact that he's forced to pay the strictest economies,

122
00:06:59.001 --> 00:07:02.360
basically the lowest possible rate for the most amount of work,

123
00:07:02.390 --> 00:07:04.250
which is how capitalism works.

124
00:07:04.580 --> 00:07:07.340
You want to pay as little as possible for the best amount of work.

125
00:07:07.430 --> 00:07:10.670
And then competition is foreign for who you can hire. Based on that.

126
00:07:11.120 --> 00:07:11.721
Additionally,

127
00:07:11.721 --> 00:07:15.770
it is categorically false that Andrew Carnegie ever thought that everybody could

128
00:07:15.771 --> 00:07:20.600
just be rich by thinking that way he thought instead like a business person

129
00:07:20.601 --> 00:07:25.010
would think that people who excelled at things of scale would inevitably make

130
00:07:25.011 --> 00:07:27.410
more money than people who didn't. In other words,

131
00:07:27.440 --> 00:07:29.480
if you can own the cloth factory,

132
00:07:29.630 --> 00:07:33.440
you can make more money than the person who sells the cloth or create the cloth

133
00:07:33.470 --> 00:07:34.303
one by one.

134
00:07:34.490 --> 00:07:38.150
There must be great scope for the exercise of special ability in the merchant

135
00:07:38.151 --> 00:07:42.380
and in the manufacturer who has to conduct fairs on a great scale that,

136
00:07:42.800 --> 00:07:46.790
that this talent for organization and management is rare among men is proved by

137
00:07:46.791 --> 00:07:51.470
the fact that invariably secures enormous rewards for its possessors.

138
00:07:52.040 --> 00:07:56.630
In other words, either Andrew Carnegie completely changed his beliefs.

139
00:07:56.810 --> 00:08:01.600
By the time he talked to Napoleon Hill and between when he wrote this book or

140
00:08:02.500 --> 00:08:03.333
somebody's lying here,

141
00:08:03.880 --> 00:08:06.820
what else do we know about Napoleon Hill that could push us one way or the

142
00:08:06.821 --> 00:08:10.660
other? Does he have a pattern of lying or is he telling the truth? Well,

143
00:08:10.930 --> 00:08:14.440
I'll let you decide from some of his incredible stories. According to him,

144
00:08:14.441 --> 00:08:16.870
president Wilson, even though he was broke,

145
00:08:17.140 --> 00:08:22.000
decided he wanted to put all Napoleon Hill on the government payroll at a rather

146
00:08:22.001 --> 00:08:25.600
attractive salary. Now, how did he meet president Wilson? Well,

147
00:08:25.601 --> 00:08:28.270
apparently of course, Andrew Carnegie really wanted them to meet.

148
00:08:28.570 --> 00:08:30.970
So they go ahead and they meet. But for once in my life,

149
00:08:31.000 --> 00:08:35.290
I had the privilege of vetoing, the president of the United States. Yeah. He,

150
00:08:35.291 --> 00:08:37.930
instead though broke, made it essential.

151
00:08:37.931 --> 00:08:41.950
He goes the extra mile without no thought of what he might receive for his

152
00:08:41.951 --> 00:08:46.060
services. In other words, he didn't charge the president of the United States,

153
00:08:46.270 --> 00:08:48.010
a penny to work for him.

154
00:08:48.430 --> 00:08:52.030
This is all despite the fact that Napoleon Hill's life up to this point has been

155
00:08:52.090 --> 00:08:55.710
solely for the purpose of accumulating riches. But when it comes the president,

156
00:08:56.070 --> 00:09:00.720
he doesn't want to impose other features of this incredible man's life is that

157
00:09:00.721 --> 00:09:04.740
apparently later on, after Woodrow Wilson had moved out of the white house,

158
00:09:05.070 --> 00:09:09.300
he got to know another president, Franklin Delano Roosevelt. Apparently,

159
00:09:09.301 --> 00:09:13.770
although his record of a real relationship proof is surprisingly

160
00:09:13.771 --> 00:09:15.720
scant, according to his biographers,

161
00:09:16.110 --> 00:09:18.390
but in conversations and in some of his papers,

162
00:09:18.420 --> 00:09:21.210
he'll sometimes claim to have coined the historic remark.

163
00:09:21.390 --> 00:09:23.580
We have nothing to fear, but fear itself

164
00:09:27.050 --> 00:09:31.130
Claim to have written a number of Roosevelt's fireside chats. That's right guys,

165
00:09:31.500 --> 00:09:35.660
while not meeting with the billionaire business magnate, Andrew Carnegie,

166
00:09:35.661 --> 00:09:39.170
he was busy consoling America, consoling America,

167
00:09:39.171 --> 00:09:42.950
and making sure that everyone felt okay by drafting the fireside chats.

168
00:09:43.490 --> 00:09:44.750
According to Napoleon Hill,

169
00:09:44.870 --> 00:09:48.770
he supplied the president with a steady stream of suggestions for topics and

170
00:09:48.771 --> 00:09:50.960
fully aware of his own powers of persuasion.

171
00:09:51.110 --> 00:09:55.160
He was never bashful about supplying a script that would help the president make

172
00:09:55.161 --> 00:09:55.994
his point.

173
00:10:00.680 --> 00:10:03.320
<v 5>Oh, the original fake guru.</v>

174
00:10:03.620 --> 00:10:07.340
<v 0>Guys. This man is claiming to have mentored two presidents. I mean,</v>

175
00:10:07.341 --> 00:10:08.570
at this point he's mentoring them.

176
00:10:08.780 --> 00:10:13.250
And he personally got self-selected by w by Andrew Carnegie to be

177
00:10:13.251 --> 00:10:17.630
plucked from poverty and to be suddenly made the number one writer.

178
00:10:18.110 --> 00:10:20.090
What a lucky guy I got to say,

179
00:10:20.480 --> 00:10:23.570
as Wilson's suddenly deciding whether he should, uh,

180
00:10:23.660 --> 00:10:27.080
have an armistice for Germany and Napoleon Hill's in the room.

181
00:10:27.500 --> 00:10:30.410
And the first person he read that a coded message to was of course,

182
00:10:30.800 --> 00:10:34.490
Napoleon Hill, which a Wilson's face turned white as snow.

183
00:10:35.060 --> 00:10:39.290
When he finished reading, he handed the document to Napoleon Hill that's right.

184
00:10:39.650 --> 00:10:43.880
Top secret decoded information. Who do you give it to Napoleon Hill?

185
00:10:43.881 --> 00:10:47.120
You leave it with that person. Apparently the president was gone for 15 minutes.

186
00:10:47.150 --> 00:10:47.901
When he returned,

187
00:10:47.901 --> 00:10:51.470
he handed me a couple of sheets of paper on which he had written he's replied

188
00:10:51.620 --> 00:10:52.640
to, to the Germans,

189
00:10:52.970 --> 00:10:55.970
which ended with three questions related to the terms of the armistice.

190
00:10:56.630 --> 00:10:58.220
After I read his reply,

191
00:10:58.250 --> 00:11:02.330
he asked if Napoleon Hill had any suggestions to add to it.

192
00:11:02.840 --> 00:11:06.500
Hey Napoleon, would you like to help in world war II? Huh?

193
00:11:07.430 --> 00:11:11.780
Now all of this is starting to sound increasingly improbable and it seems like

194
00:11:11.781 --> 00:11:13.550
the whole thing is made up. Just wait.

195
00:11:13.970 --> 00:11:18.890
The story is just beginning because Napoleon Hill also faked being an attorney

196
00:11:18.920 --> 00:11:19.753
at law.

197
00:11:20.060 --> 00:11:24.650
I don't know if you guys can see that he wrote that I use Napoleon Napoleon Hill

198
00:11:24.651 --> 00:11:28.670
attorney at law, Michigan Avenue, his own biographers,

199
00:11:28.910 --> 00:11:33.650
who at this point have found it credulous and included as fact that he has been

200
00:11:33.770 --> 00:11:37.520
in an advisor to Woodrow Wilson and FDR,

201
00:11:37.670 --> 00:11:42.260
they call this a highly exaggerated claim, AKA.

202
00:11:43.050 --> 00:11:43.883
Oh.

203
00:11:45.080 --> 00:11:46.010
<v 5>Oh wow.</v>

204
00:11:46.200 --> 00:11:50.990
<v 0>All of this pales in comparison to the fake college,</v>

205
00:11:51.000 --> 00:11:53.500
this man set up that's right.

206
00:11:53.860 --> 00:11:57.820
Napoleon Hill not only started the fake testimonials,

207
00:11:57.821 --> 00:12:01.870
the fake mentorships, you know, just lying about who you met,

208
00:12:01.871 --> 00:12:05.350
lying about their advice. He also coined something else.

209
00:12:05.800 --> 00:12:09.520
The original course, guys, this is I'm serious.

210
00:12:09.940 --> 00:12:11.260
You guys don't think and grow rich,

211
00:12:11.261 --> 00:12:14.980
but you guys don't know the automobile college of Washington,

212
00:12:14.981 --> 00:12:18.910
where he supposedly trained chauffeurs and car owners to drive and prepare

213
00:12:18.911 --> 00:12:21.880
mechanics, total assembly line jobs in automobile plants.

214
00:12:22.480 --> 00:12:25.780
That's how his biographers talk about it now.

215
00:12:26.380 --> 00:12:30.430
And this is well borne out in the actual newspaper clippings that this man was

216
00:12:30.431 --> 00:12:34.450
the president of the automobile college of Washington. But what his biographers,

217
00:12:34.690 --> 00:12:37.240
coincidentally don't mention is this.

218
00:12:38.530 --> 00:12:43.030
This is an old school coffee Zilla back before

219
00:12:43.960 --> 00:12:48.310
back before a copy's Ella existed, this is the original thing.

220
00:12:48.430 --> 00:12:52.000
Some guy wrote pointing the easy route to get rich quick land,

221
00:12:52.240 --> 00:12:55.540
which was an expos Z on Napoleon Hill.

222
00:12:55.780 --> 00:13:00.520
I'm not even lying this man during his life was exposed for

223
00:13:00.521 --> 00:13:03.760
running a fake course. He got Szilard look at this, okay.

224
00:13:04.180 --> 00:13:06.850
I'll only read you the most important parts. Okay?

225
00:13:07.090 --> 00:13:11.920
So they make fun of the fact that they call this the greatest school of expert

226
00:13:11.921 --> 00:13:14.770
automobile engineering in the United States.

227
00:13:15.100 --> 00:13:17.350
Does that not sound like a Caleb Maddix line?

228
00:13:17.590 --> 00:13:20.590
The greatest opportunity of our era, literally nothing has changed.

229
00:13:21.090 --> 00:13:25.350
<v 6>I really believe that the Y team method is the greatest opportunity of our era.</v>

230
00:13:25.680 --> 00:13:26.550
<v 0>Additionally,</v>

231
00:13:26.610 --> 00:13:30.660
this thing says the catalog ought to be worth its weight in gold to the

232
00:13:30.690 --> 00:13:34.950
dyspeptic four. There's a good laugh on every page, which is, you know,

233
00:13:35.310 --> 00:13:38.910
old town speak for this guy is a clown.

234
00:13:39.210 --> 00:13:41.460
And they're talking about the automobile college of Washington.

235
00:13:42.030 --> 00:13:46.050
Apparently the whole scheme was a big plan to get free labor from

236
00:13:46.470 --> 00:13:49.920
college students. So you would pay in and they would get free labor.

237
00:13:49.921 --> 00:13:53.220
How it work is you'd go into the school. And while training you,

238
00:13:53.221 --> 00:13:56.820
you worked for them, you paid to be trained while you worked for them.

239
00:13:57.000 --> 00:13:59.820
And they had partnered with like an automobile manufacturer.

240
00:14:00.000 --> 00:14:01.110
And supposedly at the end,

241
00:14:01.111 --> 00:14:03.060
you're supposed to get this sales job where you could make, you know,

242
00:14:03.070 --> 00:14:07.050
thousands of dollars at the time. None of that was true. See,

243
00:14:07.080 --> 00:14:10.560
Napoleon Hill was also the first person to, uh, make big income claims.

244
00:14:10.860 --> 00:14:14.790
Our course prepares you to earn $4,800 a year or more

245
00:14:15.690 --> 00:14:16.320
briefly.

246
00:14:16.320 --> 00:14:20.010
The plan is all that those who attend and become a student of this college will

247
00:14:20.011 --> 00:14:23.940
get a job in this college become sales agents. Guys,

248
00:14:23.941 --> 00:14:26.610
you can be a high ticket closer for Napoleon Hill. See,

249
00:14:26.611 --> 00:14:30.390
he was the first one to do it, right? And why am I showing you all of this?

250
00:14:30.530 --> 00:14:32.610
Where are we going through so much detail? Well guys,

251
00:14:33.000 --> 00:14:37.290
you might've been mystified before when somebody who has as good of a reputation

252
00:14:37.291 --> 00:14:41.310
as the Pauline Hill could produce such sleazebags as people like,

253
00:14:41.311 --> 00:14:45.600
you know your locks of the world, you're a Tai Lopez's of the world.

254
00:14:45.940 --> 00:14:49.920
How does that square away? But when you actually look at Napoleon Hill's life,

255
00:14:50.070 --> 00:14:53.090
and then you look at the life, people who are inspired by them, you go, Oh yeah,

256
00:14:53.150 --> 00:14:54.320
they're the same person.

257
00:14:54.650 --> 00:14:59.090
This guy used the tactics that modern day fake business gurus are using before

258
00:14:59.091 --> 00:15:03.110
it was ever a thing. And then he wrote their Bible. Are we really surprised?

259
00:15:03.380 --> 00:15:05.000
But wait guys, there's more,

260
00:15:05.030 --> 00:15:08.870
there's also a multi-level marketing side to this a whole whole scheme.

261
00:15:08.871 --> 00:15:11.570
And by the way, remember, this is a paper from back in the day.

262
00:15:11.600 --> 00:15:14.570
This is all historical. Okay? So I'm not making any of this stuff up.

263
00:15:14.780 --> 00:15:19.760
It's all factually either in Napoleon Hill's biography, newspaper clippings,

264
00:15:19.761 --> 00:15:23.810
Andrew Carnegie's biography. So don't get mad at me. This is not me saying it.

265
00:15:24.080 --> 00:15:25.400
It's like the fault of everyone.

266
00:15:25.401 --> 00:15:29.420
Who's read Napoleon Hill up to this point and never bothered to look any further

267
00:15:29.630 --> 00:15:34.430
than simply thinking grow rich. Now, not only does Napoleon Hill do all of that.

268
00:15:34.431 --> 00:15:39.110
He also made it an MLM. This college, he says the very day you enroll.

269
00:15:39.560 --> 00:15:42.760
You may begin to send this to the names of young men who you might be, you,

270
00:15:42.761 --> 00:15:47.230
you think might be interested in, in our course and you got commissions for it,

271
00:15:48.100 --> 00:15:52.210
guys. I can't stand this.

272
00:15:52.450 --> 00:15:55.180
This man is a con man. And that he says, Oh,

273
00:15:55.181 --> 00:15:58.510
you're going to pay for your course several times over in this manner.

274
00:15:58.540 --> 00:16:02.290
Now this author of course points out that if everyone did this,

275
00:16:02.291 --> 00:16:05.860
then of course the entire district of Columbia would soon be required for the

276
00:16:05.861 --> 00:16:10.720
campus. Obviously this stuff grows exponentially. So these both back in the day,

277
00:16:10.780 --> 00:16:13.810
back in the 19 hundreds, this guy was a con man.

278
00:16:14.230 --> 00:16:16.840
But through the power of just kind of whitewashing history,

279
00:16:16.841 --> 00:16:19.810
little by little people forget that these things exist.

280
00:16:19.840 --> 00:16:24.640
This man has managed to make a reputation for himself of being some genius.

281
00:16:25.030 --> 00:16:25.960
Is this in reality,

282
00:16:26.020 --> 00:16:30.640
even by his biographers accounts who are super generous with them who believe

283
00:16:30.641 --> 00:16:31.690
all his stupid claims,

284
00:16:32.140 --> 00:16:37.030
he was constantly broke constantly in debt even went to jail. Oh yeah.

285
00:16:37.031 --> 00:16:41.110
I forgot about that. Did I tell you that he went to jail for a stock scheme,

286
00:16:41.350 --> 00:16:44.530
which is why he got arrested for blue sky stuff,

287
00:16:44.531 --> 00:16:47.110
which is an Illinois law about unlicensed securities,

288
00:16:47.111 --> 00:16:50.500
that law he was arrested and released. And do you know what his excuse was?

289
00:16:51.490 --> 00:16:55.660
Hill claimed that he was simply a forceful writer. Guys,

290
00:16:56.170 --> 00:16:58.600
we stopped for a second and just ask you, have you heard that before?

291
00:16:58.750 --> 00:17:01.960
Have you ever heard a marketer who I'm calling a fake Google? Hey,

292
00:17:01.961 --> 00:17:05.280
I just like to aggressively market, you know, so what I say,

293
00:17:05.281 --> 00:17:06.270
you're gonna make a million dollars.

294
00:17:06.430 --> 00:17:11.200
It's just aggressive marketing thesis where it all comes from. This is why,

295
00:17:11.440 --> 00:17:15.130
again, he's at the center of the board, this man,

296
00:17:15.880 --> 00:17:19.600
the con men of all con men and no buddy. No,

297
00:17:20.590 --> 00:17:23.350
I actually there's one great article about this, uh,

298
00:17:23.380 --> 00:17:27.970
paleo future gizmodo.com incredible article. I'll link it below.

299
00:17:27.971 --> 00:17:29.980
A lot of the stuff you're seeing here is from that.

300
00:17:29.981 --> 00:17:32.410
Although I went and hunted up the sources myself,

301
00:17:32.440 --> 00:17:34.330
just to make sure that they were legit,

302
00:17:34.450 --> 00:17:39.310
but this is why he's at the very center because despite maintaining an

303
00:17:39.340 --> 00:17:42.190
attitude and a reputation of perfection,

304
00:17:42.520 --> 00:17:44.800
the truth about Napoleon Hill is that,

305
00:17:45.190 --> 00:17:47.410
is that he lied about who he was talking to.

306
00:17:47.410 --> 00:17:51.900
He lied about who he was being mentored by. He invented wild claims.

307
00:17:52.110 --> 00:17:55.950
He invented the first MLM POS I don't know if that's the first MLM,

308
00:17:56.220 --> 00:17:59.780
but it's one of the first MLMs ever. He invented a of course,

309
00:18:00.080 --> 00:18:03.710
like every move that you see of the modern guru,

310
00:18:04.070 --> 00:18:08.420
it's all taken from Napoleon Hill. He's the gate he's on top.

311
00:18:08.690 --> 00:18:13.550
And he's on top for a reason because bail, he was ahead of his time. I mean,

312
00:18:13.551 --> 00:18:17.660
let me be very real with you. And the truth about him is just really not known.

313
00:18:17.661 --> 00:18:19.370
People think he's some savant,

314
00:18:19.371 --> 00:18:22.310
some genius who talked to the great minds of America,

315
00:18:22.520 --> 00:18:25.580
but the truth is they never knew him. They never heard of this guy,

316
00:18:25.790 --> 00:18:28.550
which can be proven by the fact, if you read Andrew Carnegie,

317
00:18:28.610 --> 00:18:31.430
who's written his own books. He didn't need someone to write them for him.

318
00:18:31.940 --> 00:18:36.110
They're so wildly different than Napoleon Hill Napoleon. Hill's Andrew Carnegie.

319
00:18:36.140 --> 00:18:40.730
And the real Andrew Carnegie are two completely different. One is something,

320
00:18:40.731 --> 00:18:43.190
a self-help person with a bunch of puff and fluff.

321
00:18:43.280 --> 00:18:47.030
The other is like a practical businessman who talks like a businessman who

322
00:18:47.031 --> 00:18:49.730
understands competition, who understands market forces,

323
00:18:49.910 --> 00:18:54.050
who understands that not everything is just about your mindset, right?

324
00:18:54.500 --> 00:18:59.240
So what do we make of the Napoleon Hill story now that it's all out? Well,

325
00:18:59.300 --> 00:19:00.133
it's interesting.

326
00:19:00.770 --> 00:19:04.370
Just like I think Napoleon Hill was sort of the original guru.

327
00:19:04.371 --> 00:19:09.350
I think we can learn a lot of lessons from both his successes and his failures.

328
00:19:09.530 --> 00:19:13.850
Cause obviously his fraud was very successful because millions of people have

329
00:19:13.851 --> 00:19:14.684
bought his books.

330
00:19:14.690 --> 00:19:18.320
A million millions of people have bought into this idea that he was, you know,

331
00:19:18.321 --> 00:19:21.080
some Oracle of the rich and famous.

332
00:19:21.380 --> 00:19:24.440
But the truth is when he died, he died.

333
00:19:25.400 --> 00:19:27.830
People suspect penniless. He had been bankrupt.

334
00:19:27.831 --> 00:19:29.990
Many times he had been run out of towns.

335
00:19:30.260 --> 00:19:34.490
He said there was an attempted assassination on his life, fraud,

336
00:19:34.640 --> 00:19:35.840
accusations of fraud.

337
00:19:36.320 --> 00:19:40.220
It all just follows the familiar path of our confidence, man.

338
00:19:40.250 --> 00:19:43.580
They achieve a little bit of success because scams do,

339
00:19:43.910 --> 00:19:47.930
but ultimately they're constantly undone by their own design.

340
00:19:47.931 --> 00:19:49.880
He was constantly spending too much money,

341
00:19:49.881 --> 00:19:52.640
spending more money than he could afford chased by creditors.

342
00:19:52.820 --> 00:19:57.050
This man is not someone you want to look up to, even though on the outside,

343
00:19:57.080 --> 00:19:58.460
all that glitters is gold.

344
00:19:58.760 --> 00:20:03.170
The truth is that something was rotting at the heart of Napoleon Hill's story.

345
00:20:03.620 --> 00:20:04.190
You know,

346
00:20:04.190 --> 00:20:06.980
I know that this might seem weird for me to say at the very end of all this,

347
00:20:06.981 --> 00:20:11.600
but I do think there's good things in think and grow rich about

348
00:20:11.601 --> 00:20:13.910
positive thinking about goal setting.

349
00:20:14.180 --> 00:20:17.330
But the problem is that thinking grow rich takes it too far.

350
00:20:17.540 --> 00:20:20.480
It makes it into some gospel of success.

351
00:20:20.660 --> 00:20:24.260
That positive thinking is Judy, that you don't need luck,

352
00:20:24.320 --> 00:20:25.670
that you don't need talent,

353
00:20:25.790 --> 00:20:29.030
that any person can just themselves into a trillion dollars.

354
00:20:29.031 --> 00:20:30.860
And if you don't have that trillion dollars yet,

355
00:20:31.240 --> 00:20:33.440
what you just must not be thinking about it enough.

356
00:20:33.441 --> 00:20:35.870
You must not be desiring it enough.

357
00:20:36.260 --> 00:20:41.000
That is completely ridiculous and leads to a toxic system of punishment for

358
00:20:41.001 --> 00:20:44.030
people who haven't achieved their dreams. As my friend,

359
00:20:44.210 --> 00:20:47.770
James Johnnie would later say in his series on the of attraction.

360
00:20:48.670 --> 00:20:52.330
So I'm not saying throw out your book of thinking grow rich.

361
00:20:52.420 --> 00:20:56.020
If you want to keep it, if it helps you, Hey, I think that's fine,

362
00:20:56.410 --> 00:20:59.050
but you should know who Napoleon Hill was.

363
00:20:59.080 --> 00:21:01.900
You should know what the end of his life looked like.

364
00:21:02.200 --> 00:21:05.740
And you should know who he really talked to and who he really didn't.

365
00:21:06.370 --> 00:21:08.620
Thanks for watching. And I'll see you in the next one.

366
00:21:19.350 --> 00:21:19.350
