1
00:00:00.270 --> 00:00:04.220
<v 0>Well really back up, who has ties with the geek?</v>

2
00:00:04.680 --> 00:00:07.200
Kusa I didn't lock in his people.

3
00:00:08.100 --> 00:00:11.070
They were sent that live during the classes.

4
00:00:11.610 --> 00:00:14.190
They were telling you guys they have ties. Yes.

5
00:00:14.700 --> 00:00:18.510
Dan Lok knew you were homeless during this thing. And yes,

6
00:00:18.511 --> 00:00:22.440
of course you're saying is what made you homeless? Yes.

7
00:00:23.370 --> 00:00:24.990
And he was going upstairs.

8
00:00:26.100 --> 00:00:30.750
I somewhat pause working and I start feeling some pain

9
00:00:31.110 --> 00:00:35.550
in my feet, my shoes,

10
00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:40.290
my socks, and realized actually my feet were bleeding,

11
00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:45.960
HTC family. They GC family. Didn't help you out. There's little family.

12
00:00:50.880 --> 00:00:52.860
<v 1>I hear you have a, quite the story. Yeah.</v>

13
00:00:53.480 --> 00:00:57.230
<v 0>Yes, yes. I made an inspirational speaker. I bet. Pell grant.</v>

14
00:00:57.500 --> 00:01:00.500
I'm a civil engineer and uh,

15
00:01:00.530 --> 00:01:03.560
the crazy story start many years ago,

16
00:01:04.130 --> 00:01:06.950
when on a cold night of December,

17
00:01:07.340 --> 00:01:10.490
I was just browsing online on my laptop.

18
00:01:10.820 --> 00:01:13.790
And I came across an odd saying,

19
00:01:14.570 --> 00:01:18.260
learning this new high-income skill will allow you to,

20
00:01:18.650 --> 00:01:23.270
to add six figure income working from anywhere in the world,

21
00:01:23.720 --> 00:01:28.100
only using a laptop and a phone and managing your own schedule,

22
00:01:29.210 --> 00:01:31.160
register for the webinar to learn more.

23
00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:34.100
So I thought this could be a great opportunity.

24
00:01:34.610 --> 00:01:38.960
So as attending the B, I said to myself,

25
00:01:39.320 --> 00:01:42.050
this is definitely a great opportunity.

26
00:01:42.980 --> 00:01:47.120
Now I was very excited and wanted to join the program

27
00:01:47.450 --> 00:01:49.130
right then, and that,

28
00:01:49.430 --> 00:01:54.050
but just like most of people I was facing the most common issue.

29
00:01:54.830 --> 00:01:58.040
I just didn't have enough money to afford the program.

30
00:01:58.490 --> 00:02:00.860
And I was working as a civil engineer,

31
00:02:01.550 --> 00:02:04.850
but all my money was going into my apartment.

32
00:02:05.270 --> 00:02:09.560
It had a nice car and nice lapsed lifestyle. So I thought to myself,

33
00:02:09.710 --> 00:02:14.660
I would just have to catch some asbestos for a few months so I can afford

34
00:02:14.930 --> 00:02:18.830
the program, which was eating at home all the time.

35
00:02:18.890 --> 00:02:20.090
So no more restaurants.

36
00:02:20.480 --> 00:02:24.080
And I was driving a very nice red Mazda.

37
00:02:24.110 --> 00:02:28.760
R is it hard to park my car? No mortgages, no more insurance.

38
00:02:29.150 --> 00:02:33.590
I was walking every day to work or taking the bus.

39
00:02:34.550 --> 00:02:39.170
<v 1>Oh my God. Wow. That's a heavy sacrifice. Wow. That's crazy.</v>

40
00:02:39.680 --> 00:02:42.380
<v 0>That's great. Yes. And we make God,</v>

41
00:02:42.490 --> 00:02:44.930
it will maybe take me 10 minutes to get to work.

42
00:02:45.380 --> 00:02:47.690
The boss will take maybe an hour

43
00:02:49.220 --> 00:02:51.110
or sometimes I'll just working.

44
00:02:51.740 --> 00:02:56.600
And few times I will be walking and some coworkers will try to pass

45
00:02:56.601 --> 00:02:58.910
me and give me that smile.

46
00:02:59.440 --> 00:03:01.900
Almost a love heart Cobb.

47
00:03:02.020 --> 00:03:05.050
He cannot afford the scar anymore. Right.

48
00:03:05.590 --> 00:03:08.710
But I knew I was investing in myself. Oh.

49
00:03:08.711 --> 00:03:11.830
I thought I was investing in myself. Sure. So,

50
00:03:12.550 --> 00:03:16.300
and didn't even waste my time explaining to them.

51
00:03:17.200 --> 00:03:21.460
And now at my job, just like all of us at heart,

52
00:03:21.490 --> 00:03:25.780
that one coworker I was more close to than other people.

53
00:03:26.410 --> 00:03:30.580
And I will go to him, talking to him about what I'm working on.

54
00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:35.260
And I talk to him about high ticket closing. He went home,

55
00:03:35.740 --> 00:03:39.670
talked to his wife and came back to me the next morning and said,

56
00:03:39.790 --> 00:03:41.440
this is not a great opportunity.

57
00:03:41.860 --> 00:03:45.820
You are wasting your time and you will waste your money. But I said, no,

58
00:03:45.880 --> 00:03:49.810
you do not understand Danielle. This is a great opportunity.

59
00:03:50.380 --> 00:03:54.880
And I would probably leave my job anytime soon. I'll also still.

60
00:03:55.630 --> 00:03:59.860
So after a few more, after getting some asbestos,

61
00:04:00.280 --> 00:04:04.120
I was not able to invest into this program

62
00:04:05.050 --> 00:04:06.430
on a payment plan.

63
00:04:08.580 --> 00:04:11.760
<v 2>How much did the total cost of the thing cost? How much was it total?</v>

64
00:04:12.840 --> 00:04:16.890
<v 0>It wants a lot of money at a loss over 20 K.</v>

65
00:04:17.610 --> 00:04:22.200
First, you have to pay like around $3,000 for the first part of the program.

66
00:04:22.920 --> 00:04:27.570
Then they have an inner circle and they have their event in

67
00:04:27.571 --> 00:04:31.470
Vancouver. You have to fly to that. Exactly.

68
00:04:31.860 --> 00:04:36.270
And then after that, they have created a program that is called,

69
00:04:36.960 --> 00:04:40.590
uh, what's the name, high ticket, high ticket on it.

70
00:04:40.740 --> 00:04:45.030
And that was the worst spot ever. Let me just get to that.

71
00:04:45.480 --> 00:04:49.890
So now I was able to afford this program and I paid for the

72
00:04:49.891 --> 00:04:50.610
program.

73
00:04:50.610 --> 00:04:55.560
I joined the program and every single thing was well

74
00:04:55.590 --> 00:04:58.500
designed. Nothing was left to chest.

75
00:04:58.800 --> 00:05:02.850
Everything looked perfect every single time before Sasha,

76
00:05:03.150 --> 00:05:07.740
I will have my notebook ready, pen it. Glass of water,

77
00:05:07.950 --> 00:05:10.490
not just structure for four hours. It was every single attend.

78
00:05:10.491 --> 00:05:13.890
The program was seven weeks long. And during the program,

79
00:05:14.650 --> 00:05:19.110
they told us that we have to be fully committed to this opportunity to make it

80
00:05:19.111 --> 00:05:22.680
work. So listen very carefully to the following.

81
00:05:23.610 --> 00:05:26.280
People gave up university,

82
00:05:26.850 --> 00:05:29.130
people gave up college,

83
00:05:29.610 --> 00:05:34.590
people gave up the job just for this opportunity because

84
00:05:34.591 --> 00:05:39.510
they told us that we could recruit sister, get income from this opportunity.

85
00:05:41.100 --> 00:05:45.870
At some point at the deceit was just the

86
00:05:45.871 --> 00:05:50.250
worst decision ever. I left my job at [inaudible] just,

87
00:05:50.520 --> 00:05:55.020
this will work. And it was also my fault. I didn't make the right decision.

88
00:05:55.380 --> 00:05:56.970
Now, after the seven weeks,

89
00:05:57.920 --> 00:06:02.360
it was not tired to go out there and to try out

90
00:06:02.540 --> 00:06:06.380
what we just let the worst spot.

91
00:06:07.940 --> 00:06:11.780
At that time, they have collected hammered, harlot,

92
00:06:11.960 --> 00:06:16.850
dozens of testimonials from S we didn't even

93
00:06:16.880 --> 00:06:20.630
try out that skill to understand,

94
00:06:20.690 --> 00:06:24.500
to know whether it works or not, but they gave them.

95
00:06:25.120 --> 00:06:27.430
<v 1>Clear, clear, here. They captured your testimony.</v>

96
00:06:27.431 --> 00:06:30.940
They got you to say how great the program is before you got to test out the

97
00:06:30.941 --> 00:06:31.630
program.

98
00:06:31.630 --> 00:06:34.270
<v 0>It's really important. Yes, yes, yes.</v>

99
00:06:34.630 --> 00:06:37.600
<v 1>Probably somewhere on Dan lock's page saying how great Dan lock-in.</v>

100
00:06:37.640 --> 00:06:39.970
<v 0>Yes, yes, yes.</v>

101
00:06:40.810 --> 00:06:45.640
We're not even thinking about it. It's just, it's just crazy.

102
00:06:46.060 --> 00:06:50.620
So not to a stat to go out there and to sit and to test the program and the

103
00:06:50.621 --> 00:06:53.260
heart many season for season,

104
00:06:53.920 --> 00:06:57.520
they get them to the seven weeks they graduate and then they have the next

105
00:06:57.521 --> 00:06:59.440
season. After the season,

106
00:07:00.070 --> 00:07:04.000
they clearly realized that these was not working.

107
00:07:04.450 --> 00:07:08.680
People were going to the marketplace, but it was just not working.

108
00:07:08.980 --> 00:07:13.540
They could have peace, the issue by listening, but they decide not to,

109
00:07:14.320 --> 00:07:16.420
during the program, during the classes,

110
00:07:16.840 --> 00:07:21.430
they were telling some people quit trying to speak out because it was not

111
00:07:21.431 --> 00:07:26.290
working, that they have some ties with the Yakuza trickling people.

112
00:07:29.320 --> 00:07:33.040
<v 1>[Inaudible] back up, who has ties with the geek Kusa.</v>

113
00:07:33.910 --> 00:07:34.780
<v 0>I then lock.</v>

114
00:07:34.930 --> 00:07:39.460
And his people there were sent that live during the classes

115
00:07:39.940 --> 00:07:40.773
live. They were telling me.

116
00:07:40.780 --> 00:07:43.870
<v 1>You guys, they have ties with Kusa. So Dalton.</v>

117
00:07:43.880 --> 00:07:45.670
So don't mess with them basically.

118
00:07:46.000 --> 00:07:48.220
<v 0>No they're saying that's what they think.</v>

119
00:07:48.880 --> 00:07:53.050
So they're attracting people live during the classes,

120
00:07:54.880 --> 00:07:57.400
live during the classes and telling people,

121
00:07:57.730 --> 00:08:02.500
even if we take you out of the program and do not give

122
00:08:02.501 --> 00:08:05.830
you back your money, who cares anyway.

123
00:08:06.820 --> 00:08:09.730
And that's the part that changed everything for me.

124
00:08:10.090 --> 00:08:13.720
And we got to those people that's because, yes,

125
00:08:13.750 --> 00:08:18.400
because it's not because you think

126
00:08:18.800 --> 00:08:23.470
that it above others, that you have to misread that that does not work.

127
00:08:23.530 --> 00:08:28.240
It goes against my values and principles. It just does not work.

128
00:08:28.660 --> 00:08:33.130
And here is another part at the beginning,

129
00:08:33.670 --> 00:08:37.690
eh, even dot and wanted to work for him

130
00:08:38.650 --> 00:08:41.440
that I realized during my life,

131
00:08:41.920 --> 00:08:46.810
I had some very nice job from working with the Canadian government to hobby

132
00:08:47.020 --> 00:08:51.070
an internship with the United nation when I was 18 or 19.

133
00:08:51.610 --> 00:08:54.910
So I have worked at Chris' places. Then I,

134
00:08:55.710 --> 00:08:58.680
that this guy is just a number.

135
00:08:59.640 --> 00:09:04.140
He think no one should speak to him. People should just execute.

136
00:09:04.910 --> 00:09:07.910
<v 3>He thinks he's an emperor. He's not an emperor, but he thinks he's one.</v>

137
00:09:09.410 --> 00:09:10.850
<v 0>He thinks he thinks.</v>

138
00:09:11.240 --> 00:09:16.010
So it was now time at the end of the program to go out

139
00:09:16.011 --> 00:09:20.750
there and just test what we have learned from him during the first three

140
00:09:21.110 --> 00:09:24.320
months, nothing. [inaudible] nothing.

141
00:09:24.980 --> 00:09:29.690
And I remember sitting there in my apartment are so upset at

142
00:09:29.691 --> 00:09:34.160
myself. How did I make that decision?

143
00:09:34.550 --> 00:09:37.820
I was not thinking also upset at myself.

144
00:09:38.000 --> 00:09:42.560
I have never been so upset as Pershing the wall. I was really, really upset.

145
00:09:43.550 --> 00:09:48.110
So now after a few months, I couldn't even afford my rent anymore.

146
00:09:49.340 --> 00:09:49.880
And.

147
00:09:49.880 --> 00:09:53.000
<v 3>Because at this point, you've quit your job. You're trying to sell.</v>

148
00:09:53.001 --> 00:09:55.640
But the sales aren't coming in, like Dan said, they would.

149
00:09:56.330 --> 00:09:59.480
<v 0>It was not working nothing.</v>

150
00:10:00.170 --> 00:10:03.260
And the weird part is only recently,

151
00:10:03.590 --> 00:10:08.300
we realized just from the news that at some point he

152
00:10:08.301 --> 00:10:13.160
couldn't afford his rent himself. And he always,

153
00:10:13.220 --> 00:10:17.750
he always said he owned that house of 35 million.

154
00:10:18.230 --> 00:10:20.720
And we just relaxed to Haas.

155
00:10:20.750 --> 00:10:25.700
First is only 13 millions. And he never owned that place.

156
00:10:25.760 --> 00:10:26.593
He was renting.

157
00:10:26.900 --> 00:10:30.980
And at some point couldn't even afford to pay the rent.

158
00:10:31.550 --> 00:10:34.790
So whatever you do to others, whatever,

159
00:10:34.880 --> 00:10:39.170
whatever you put out with always come back to you. Of course, of course,

160
00:10:39.490 --> 00:10:40.610
that's the first lesson.

161
00:10:41.210 --> 00:10:44.630
So at that point I couldn't even afford my rent anymore.

162
00:10:44.870 --> 00:10:49.490
So I was now spending some time at some people and new places.

163
00:10:51.740 --> 00:10:52.280
[inaudible].

164
00:10:52.280 --> 00:10:54.110
<v 3>You were crying with friends or what.</v>

165
00:10:54.440 --> 00:10:55.670
<v 0>Exactly, exactly.</v>

166
00:10:57.080 --> 00:11:01.820
At where you spend times at some people after a moment you

167
00:11:01.821 --> 00:11:02.870
had nowhere to go.

168
00:11:03.260 --> 00:11:08.060
And I remember on that night was now without arrow

169
00:11:08.570 --> 00:11:12.950
hours without a roof of former in mantra. And it is scored.

170
00:11:13.580 --> 00:11:17.360
It is very cold. I remember on that first night,

171
00:11:18.320 --> 00:11:23.240
I was spending some time at a public place and they closed

172
00:11:23.270 --> 00:11:26.810
that place at midnight or 1:00 AM.

173
00:11:27.170 --> 00:11:31.250
It was not time to close. And the security guy came up to us,

174
00:11:31.490 --> 00:11:35.120
asking us to leave as a pseudo.

175
00:11:35.570 --> 00:11:38.780
I was walking to the door, believe it or not.

176
00:11:38.900 --> 00:11:43.580
I actually remembered, I remembered that I have nowhere to go.

177
00:11:44.120 --> 00:11:46.220
I remember that it had nowhere to go.

178
00:11:46.400 --> 00:11:49.130
So I walked back and I had a seat again.

179
00:11:49.970 --> 00:11:54.760
And somehow they only realize that are still there around 3:00 AM.

180
00:11:55.360 --> 00:11:59.890
The security guard came up, came back. He was very upset. He said,

181
00:11:59.891 --> 00:12:03.130
we closed two hours ago. He was supposed to be gone.

182
00:12:03.220 --> 00:12:05.200
You have to leave right now. I stood up.

183
00:12:05.290 --> 00:12:09.400
I was not half asleep and walk to the door. Came out,

184
00:12:09.730 --> 00:12:13.840
was very cold. It was December already. I look on my right,

185
00:12:14.510 --> 00:12:18.790
look on my left hand. I let just start walking from marijuana on my right.

186
00:12:19.270 --> 00:12:23.440
Then I stop, look back and wet. Finally, on my left,

187
00:12:23.830 --> 00:12:24.970
as I was walking,

188
00:12:25.540 --> 00:12:29.320
I saw this big yellow side of a 24,

189
00:12:29.321 --> 00:12:34.000
seven fast food restaurant. Wasn't make donut also happy.

190
00:12:34.270 --> 00:12:39.010
So I got in all the MSF meal at that

191
00:12:39.011 --> 00:12:43.780
point half hot, some inches I thought are screwed and I can think,

192
00:12:43.900 --> 00:12:48.340
but I just couldn't find any possible way to get myself out of that

193
00:12:48.341 --> 00:12:49.174
situation.

194
00:12:49.620 --> 00:12:53.070
<v 4>Did you think to go get another engineering job? You're trained as an engineer?</v>

195
00:12:53.700 --> 00:12:56.940
<v 0>Yeah. I was looking for a job, but it's not that easy to.</v>

196
00:12:56.940 --> 00:12:58.610
<v 4>Get a job from kitchen job.</v>

197
00:13:00.330 --> 00:13:03.870
<v 0>And I could just go back to my parents.</v>

198
00:13:04.650 --> 00:13:08.010
I come from very dominant parents.

199
00:13:08.160 --> 00:13:10.560
And as an adult, for me,

200
00:13:10.680 --> 00:13:15.660
it does not work either because I have made some decisions that they will have

201
00:13:15.661 --> 00:13:17.880
never agree with. Never.

202
00:13:18.390 --> 00:13:22.620
So I felt like a hard to go and fix everything

203
00:13:22.980 --> 00:13:25.920
myself. So are there other my meal?

204
00:13:26.910 --> 00:13:31.890
I had a seat and somehow the manager realized something was wrong with me.

205
00:13:32.160 --> 00:13:35.970
He came up to me and he said, no one will take you out here.

206
00:13:36.680 --> 00:13:41.100
We can stay until 5:00 AM at the Metro station nearby open at

207
00:13:41.101 --> 00:13:45.580
5:00 PM. So I got my meal or stare it.

208
00:13:45.640 --> 00:13:48.900
It made me look into the window and accuracy,

209
00:13:48.960 --> 00:13:52.470
the beautiful decoration of Christmas. And you know,

210
00:13:52.471 --> 00:13:57.030
that happy spirit of Christmas. Somehow that spirit got in me.

211
00:13:57.120 --> 00:14:01.980
I was just so happy. Then I tried it M and go and went to that,

212
00:14:02.280 --> 00:14:05.160
uh, to that Metro station. During the day,

213
00:14:05.790 --> 00:14:10.620
I will go to the library reading one or two books every day, sometimes no book.

214
00:14:11.670 --> 00:14:16.290
And one day I left the washroom and as I was working

215
00:14:16.800 --> 00:14:20.220
at suddenly black out to this day,

216
00:14:20.340 --> 00:14:24.780
I still can remember what happened because for the first three days at heart,

217
00:14:24.840 --> 00:14:29.280
really little to no sleep, it was new to me. How do I sleep?

218
00:14:30.450 --> 00:14:31.290
What's as possible.

219
00:14:32.550 --> 00:14:33.383
<v 4>You're homeless. Yeah.</v>

220
00:14:34.290 --> 00:14:37.770
<v 0>Yeah. So now very concerned about my health.</v>

221
00:14:38.040 --> 00:14:41.010
I have to figure out a way to get some rest, right?

222
00:14:41.250 --> 00:14:45.270
So when I would go to that fast food restaurant, I would just have a seat,

223
00:14:45.900 --> 00:14:47.490
put both of my hands on the table,

224
00:14:48.150 --> 00:14:52.310
put my head on my hands and sleep until 5:00 AM on scene.

225
00:14:52.580 --> 00:14:55.250
They kicked me out was very,

226
00:14:55.251 --> 00:14:58.730
very embarrassing until they kicked me out during the winter.

227
00:14:58.731 --> 00:15:00.590
And I had nowhere to go at.

228
00:15:01.410 --> 00:15:04.570
<v 1>HTC family. They, she see family didn't help you out.</v>

229
00:15:05.290 --> 00:15:10.060
<v 0>There's no family. And there was no family. There was no family.</v>

230
00:15:10.150 --> 00:15:15.070
It was all a story and do not sleep

231
00:15:15.100 --> 00:15:19.690
in that position. My body was hurting. It was awful.

232
00:15:20.830 --> 00:15:24.250
And, uh, on the 25th of December, Christmas,

233
00:15:24.400 --> 00:15:29.230
they had not almost nothing to eat because they had no money left a new

234
00:15:29.231 --> 00:15:33.940
year. I had nothing, absolutely nothing to eat. Nowhere to go.

235
00:15:34.120 --> 00:15:35.350
All the places were closed.

236
00:15:35.770 --> 00:15:40.210
It was so cold that actually my tooth broke into my mouth.

237
00:15:40.570 --> 00:15:43.060
That's how cold it was. It was very cold.

238
00:15:43.570 --> 00:15:46.570
And I thought it couldn't get any worse. Right?

239
00:15:46.900 --> 00:15:49.360
<v 1>Right. Yeah. That, that's what I would think too.</v>

240
00:15:50.260 --> 00:15:54.970
<v 0>At some point I was working and I start feeling some pain</v>

241
00:15:55.270 --> 00:15:58.960
in my feet. As soon as I called and horrible,

242
00:15:58.970 --> 00:16:03.730
my shoes grew my socks and realized actually my feet

243
00:16:03.790 --> 00:16:07.690
were bleeding because of the cold. It's just,

244
00:16:08.060 --> 00:16:09.430
just Canada was very cold.

245
00:16:09.610 --> 00:16:14.110
My feet were bleeding and now I thought this was it.

246
00:16:14.800 --> 00:16:19.030
I cannot even work. I have nothing left.

247
00:16:19.570 --> 00:16:22.600
How do I get myself out of this situation?

248
00:16:24.010 --> 00:16:28.870
And that was the place I was in for four months on to you

249
00:16:29.440 --> 00:16:33.340
at, during all this time, they were going after me,

250
00:16:33.970 --> 00:16:38.650
which is very important to see who is going after you then lot and his

251
00:16:38.651 --> 00:16:39.484
people.

252
00:16:39.730 --> 00:16:43.660
So people understand exactly what kind of person he is.

253
00:16:43.960 --> 00:16:48.580
Because our speaking out saying the program does not

254
00:16:48.581 --> 00:16:50.380
work. It just does not work.

255
00:16:50.680 --> 00:16:54.820
And they are going after some of these people who are speaking out,

256
00:16:54.880 --> 00:16:56.290
many people, they are going up.

257
00:16:56.500 --> 00:16:59.140
<v 1>Dan Lok doesn't like that. Yeah. He doesn't like when people talk about him,</v>

258
00:17:00.010 --> 00:17:02.620
he really doesn't like it. What did he do to you?

259
00:17:04.060 --> 00:17:06.820
<v 0>They were just trying to, uh, to, to</v>

260
00:17:08.440 --> 00:17:09.790
let and Lincoln,

261
00:17:11.650 --> 00:17:15.340
anytime I will make a connection with people trying to sell some,

262
00:17:15.341 --> 00:17:17.440
our business coaching department.

263
00:17:17.560 --> 00:17:20.710
They are just trying to destroy everything I was working on.

264
00:17:21.490 --> 00:17:24.250
And even sending some people of Emmy,

265
00:17:24.580 --> 00:17:26.740
just to say some bad things about,

266
00:17:29.920 --> 00:17:31.000
You know, the, sorry,

267
00:17:31.590 --> 00:17:36.520
did exactly the same to Kayvon until Kayvon stopped working for him.

268
00:17:37.150 --> 00:17:41.530
And it truly leader should listen and just try to fist to adjust.

269
00:17:42.670 --> 00:17:46.510
But he didn't like that. Sure. It didn't like that.

270
00:17:47.140 --> 00:17:50.310
<v 1>So he's, he's trying to you professionally.</v>

271
00:17:50.311 --> 00:17:54.360
That's what you allege and your feet are bleeding. You're homeless.

272
00:17:54.361 --> 00:17:55.194
Does he know you're home?

273
00:17:56.540 --> 00:17:57.373
<v 0>Yes.</v>

274
00:18:00.050 --> 00:18:02.090
<v 1>Lock knew you were homeless during this thing.</v>

275
00:18:02.600 --> 00:18:05.600
And his course you're saying is what made you home?

276
00:18:06.020 --> 00:18:09.770
<v 0>Yes, yes. And who was still going after me?</v>

277
00:18:12.200 --> 00:18:13.250
And, uh,

278
00:18:14.120 --> 00:18:19.100
off that happened just because I made that decision to go

279
00:18:19.101 --> 00:18:23.270
through his program. That one decision.

280
00:18:23.630 --> 00:18:26.930
<v 1>So you were crushing, it let's paint the picture of where you were before.</v>

281
00:18:27.560 --> 00:18:31.790
You're a civil engineer working for the government, working for the government,

282
00:18:31.791 --> 00:18:36.500
making a tidy little living. Nice living. Have a nice car.

283
00:18:36.590 --> 00:18:41.240
You go join Dan Lux course within how many months are you at a point where you

284
00:18:41.241 --> 00:18:42.350
just can't afford rent anymore?

285
00:18:45.800 --> 00:18:47.600
<v 0>It nine, nine month. So.</v>

286
00:18:47.690 --> 00:18:49.850
<v 1>It was a nine month kind of process from,</v>

287
00:18:50.360 --> 00:18:54.620
from leaving your job or from Le like leaving, uh, starting the course,

288
00:18:54.621 --> 00:18:55.454
his courses.

289
00:18:55.910 --> 00:18:57.470
<v 0>From starting to costs. Okay.</v>

290
00:18:57.740 --> 00:19:01.430
<v 1>So how did he make that $20,000 from you? Because from what I understand,</v>

291
00:19:01.780 --> 00:19:06.770
tight ticket closure is $2,500. What's what else? How much is closures in black?

292
00:19:06.771 --> 00:19:09.920
Probably is pretty expensive. Cause you gotta fly. You gotta rent a hotel.

293
00:19:10.400 --> 00:19:13.130
And then the other one, what is it? Inner circle. How much is that?

294
00:19:14.090 --> 00:19:18.830
<v 0>All right, so [inaudible] a month. Okay. Yeah. To be part of inner circle.</v>

295
00:19:19.370 --> 00:19:20.350
Okay. Okay.

296
00:19:21.590 --> 00:19:25.580
And some people even lost more money than me.

297
00:19:26.090 --> 00:19:26.660
<v 1>I've no doubt.</v>

298
00:19:26.660 --> 00:19:30.020
I I've heard that when he was rolling out high ticket millionaire,

299
00:19:30.050 --> 00:19:32.600
people were putting themselves in debt to join. Is that true?

300
00:19:33.710 --> 00:19:36.350
<v 0>I did the SIM. Wait. Yeah.</v>

301
00:19:36.690 --> 00:19:38.450
<v 1>You went in debt for high tea.</v>

302
00:19:38.480 --> 00:19:40.070
I thought you said you didn't join high ticket millionaire.

303
00:19:41.180 --> 00:19:45.590
<v 0>Not like a bit like the Antiope. At some point I had to borrow some money.</v>

304
00:19:45.650 --> 00:19:46.890
I borrow some money at some point.

305
00:19:48.470 --> 00:19:51.670
<v 1>Oh, I see. I see. During the process of engaging with deadlock,</v>

306
00:19:51.671 --> 00:19:54.770
you had to borrow money at some point. How much did, how much did you borrow?

307
00:19:58.340 --> 00:19:59.173
<v 0>Well,</v>

308
00:20:01.130 --> 00:20:04.940
the vast majority of people going through that program brought some money.

309
00:20:05.240 --> 00:20:09.500
There were even helping people borrow some money so they can afford that

310
00:20:09.501 --> 00:20:11.990
program. Could you imagine,

311
00:20:12.410 --> 00:20:15.290
do I giving people add yes.

312
00:20:15.950 --> 00:20:19.700
Apart to borrow some money where to get some money so they can afford the

313
00:20:19.701 --> 00:20:22.550
program, which was a scam to start with.

314
00:20:23.270 --> 00:20:25.850
<v 1>I don't even understand how he has that many upsells.</v>

315
00:20:27.260 --> 00:20:32.150
<v 0>Because it's just, he got like so many upsells down sells,</v>

316
00:20:32.300 --> 00:20:35.900
cross sells subscription. It was awkward,

317
00:20:36.710 --> 00:20:40.640
but it is very important that I say the following.

318
00:20:40.940 --> 00:20:45.620
It was also my fault for not making the right decision.

319
00:20:46.730 --> 00:20:49.570
I of have thought about it. Ma

320
00:20:51.340 --> 00:20:55.600
do some research maybe so I could make the right decision.

321
00:20:56.430 --> 00:21:01.050
<v 1>Um, how long has it been since you kind of got your stuff back together?</v>

322
00:21:02.790 --> 00:21:07.530
<v 0>Uh, since March 7th. So it's fresh. The wound is fresh. Yes.</v>

323
00:21:07.620 --> 00:21:08.850
Yes. I just can't.

324
00:21:09.000 --> 00:21:11.690
<v 1>And get past the fact that Dan Locke was going,</v>

325
00:21:11.740 --> 00:21:16.530
you say was going after you while your feet are bleeding

326
00:21:16.980 --> 00:21:18.180
because you're, you're broke.

327
00:21:18.480 --> 00:21:22.200
You have no roof over your head and he's still going after you.

328
00:21:23.640 --> 00:21:27.690
<v 0>Yes. Why would that's who he is? That's who he is. What do you mean by that?</v>

329
00:21:28.350 --> 00:21:33.120
Like we always say you have to do everything to protect

330
00:21:33.180 --> 00:21:34.110
your reputation,

331
00:21:34.950 --> 00:21:39.780
but something that he maybe needs to understand is that in the first

332
00:21:39.781 --> 00:21:43.110
place you have to watch the character as a person.

333
00:21:43.620 --> 00:21:48.300
It is our responsibility to be a good person. So you have a good reputation.

334
00:21:49.410 --> 00:21:54.090
It is not about other people to cover your mistake and your bad character.

335
00:21:55.110 --> 00:21:56.010
Does that make sense?

336
00:21:56.760 --> 00:21:58.620
<v 1>Yeah, no, no, no. It totally makes sense.</v>

337
00:21:59.100 --> 00:22:00.420
<v 0>So that's the sorry.</v>

338
00:22:00.510 --> 00:22:05.130
And I hope people learn something from that and, uh,

339
00:22:05.730 --> 00:22:09.270
that did the make a better decision than I did.

340
00:22:10.320 --> 00:22:14.580
I have learned my lessons. It costs me a lot, but I lend it.

341
00:22:16.380 --> 00:22:21.120
<v 1>I really appreciate you coming on Gill. Um, thank you.</v>

342
00:22:21.121 --> 00:22:26.100
I know even doing this program is a risk to yourself because I know Dan

343
00:22:26.670 --> 00:22:30.390
Locke and you know, Dan Locke and we know how he is.

344
00:22:30.720 --> 00:22:33.240
So thank you for taking,

345
00:22:33.270 --> 00:22:37.950
having the courage to speak out about this man

346
00:22:38.220 --> 00:22:41.010
and what his course did to you. Because as you know,

347
00:22:41.011 --> 00:22:45.180
he's got 2 million subscribers, he's got tons of people joining every day.

348
00:22:45.330 --> 00:22:47.130
And I think you're right.

349
00:22:47.131 --> 00:22:49.890
I'm not sure that they know necessarily what they're getting themselves into.

350
00:22:49.891 --> 00:22:54.840
So hopefully you're a testimonial about the true cost

351
00:22:54.930 --> 00:22:58.140
and experience of Dan's course will,

352
00:22:58.430 --> 00:23:00.630
will help people make a more informed decision. Thank you so much.

353
00:23:01.680 --> 00:23:03.060
<v 0>It was my pleasure. Thank you.</v>

354
00:23:34.470 --> 00:23:34.470
<v 5>[Inaudible].</v>
