00:00:00.090 --> 00:00:01.080
<v 0>What up, welcome to coffee Ella.</v>

2
00:00:01.081 --> 00:00:04.500
Today we're covering part two of the Nigerian scammer. Today.

3
00:00:04.530 --> 00:00:08.610
We confronted him and ask him why he did it with what's in his mind.

4
00:00:08.640 --> 00:00:10.050
What's going on in Nigeria.

5
00:00:10.140 --> 00:00:12.980
But before we go get into anything else before we talk about the $10 million

6
00:00:12.981 --> 00:00:15.590
studio, which as you can see is coming together. Let me say,

7
00:00:15.650 --> 00:00:18.350
I saw a disturbing figure on the internet.

8
00:00:18.380 --> 00:00:21.800
This may be the worst thing I've ever seen. Check it out.

9
00:00:23.090 --> 00:00:28.040
58% of you have not smashed like

10
00:00:28.100 --> 00:00:32.090
and subscribed dude. How many times does Anaqua have to tell you?

11
00:00:32.720 --> 00:00:36.200
Okay. Um, I'm off. Okay. So this October,

12
00:00:36.201 --> 00:00:40.880
my goal for October is to get this number to 50%

13
00:00:41.840 --> 00:00:46.820
subscribes need to come up. And if you're not subscribed, you need to leave.

14
00:00:46.850 --> 00:00:50.240
So that's my big thing for October. Uh,

15
00:00:50.270 --> 00:00:52.640
we can only write so much when he wrongs on the internet,

16
00:00:52.641 --> 00:00:56.450
but this is definitely one of them. Now, anyways, without further ado,

17
00:00:56.480 --> 00:00:57.313
let me just say.

18
00:00:57.770 --> 00:01:00.290
<v 1>Um, how's this audio sound by the way.</v>

19
00:01:00.590 --> 00:01:04.790
<v 0>We fixed that, I know that was potato for awhile. It's getting better. It's not,</v>

20
00:01:04.791 --> 00:01:07.220
I'm not going to say it's perfect, but it's getting better.

21
00:01:08.090 --> 00:01:09.500
The visuals are getting better.

22
00:01:09.770 --> 00:01:13.970
The $10 million studio I told you guys just patience. Oh, there it goes.

23
00:01:13.971 --> 00:01:18.230
It popped again. Patience. I got to not, sorry.

24
00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:19.153
I got it up.

25
00:01:21.530 --> 00:01:22.160
<v 1>Uh.</v>

26
00:01:22.160 --> 00:01:25.700
<v 0>Coming together slowly, but frankly I could use, um,</v>

27
00:01:25.730 --> 00:01:30.080
some of your help if you happen to have some digital 3d work and unreal engine

28
00:01:30.081 --> 00:01:35.000
or anything like that for virtual sets, uh, I could really use you, frankly.

29
00:01:35.090 --> 00:01:37.190
So if you're familiar, if you're a fan of the show,

30
00:01:37.910 --> 00:01:42.200
if you're looking for a side project during Cove, um, I could really use it.

31
00:01:42.590 --> 00:01:46.850
All right. That's it. Sorry to rant at you guys for a little bit.

32
00:01:46.970 --> 00:01:50.870
I know a lot of you are going to be like ha video starts at two minutes. Uh, no,

33
00:01:51.320 --> 00:01:54.560
everything I just said was very important. So enough of that,

34
00:01:54.920 --> 00:01:56.660
don't say that ever again. But anyways,

35
00:01:57.020 --> 00:01:59.360
let's talk about what we came here to talk about,

36
00:01:59.361 --> 00:02:02.000
which is my confrontation with the scammer.

37
00:02:02.001 --> 00:02:04.700
So at first things first I tried calling him and I'm going to go,

38
00:02:04.701 --> 00:02:07.130
why didn't you call him? I tried, he immediately hung up on me.

39
00:02:07.400 --> 00:02:10.610
And so I panicked and I was like, Oh crap, he's going to block this number.

40
00:02:11.420 --> 00:02:14.150
Cause I only had one number for him. So I immediately kind of, uh,

41
00:02:14.180 --> 00:02:18.170
played hardball. I said, look, you block me. I'm going to the authorities.

42
00:02:18.230 --> 00:02:21.830
I'm going to SARS. The truth is I was bluffing.

43
00:02:22.130 --> 00:02:23.960
I don't even know how to get a hold of, of SARS.

44
00:02:23.961 --> 00:02:27.260
I wouldn't have gotten a hold of SARS anyway, playing hard ball,

45
00:02:27.590 --> 00:02:32.000
playing with scammers. So I said, look, you, you go to go, go to block me.

46
00:02:32.480 --> 00:02:36.680
I'm going to go to SARS. Bye. I said, I have screenshot.

47
00:02:36.710 --> 00:02:40.340
This is after he hung up on me. He said, who's this? I said,

48
00:02:40.341 --> 00:02:45.170
just an interested journalist. I dunno, am I a journalist? I don't know if I am.

49
00:02:46.310 --> 00:02:50.630
We'll just say, Hey, what scam? So he plays dumb. I sent him some screenshots.

50
00:02:50.631 --> 00:02:54.530
He plays dumb. No, that ain't me. What scam? That are no scam going on. Anyway,

51
00:02:54.770 --> 00:02:59.030
liar. He establishes himself as a liar early on in this conversation.

52
00:02:59.110 --> 00:03:01.900
Just want to say that. Okay. He's just playing dumb.

53
00:03:01.901 --> 00:03:05.550
Are you talking about a Bitcoin scam or something? Finally, I get to the point.

54
00:03:05.560 --> 00:03:10.380
I say you scam people with Instagram investing pages.

55
00:03:11.040 --> 00:03:15.240
There's no getting out of it. I know everything it's too late. Oh,

56
00:03:15.241 --> 00:03:19.350
I understand now. Ha. It didn't work, bro. People were smarter,

57
00:03:19.410 --> 00:03:24.120
especially when it comes to Bitcoin, press X to doubt.

58
00:03:24.630 --> 00:03:27.630
This is a part of the conversation. I almost skipped by it.

59
00:03:27.780 --> 00:03:29.370
Cause frankly it's like kind of useless.

60
00:03:29.520 --> 00:03:31.530
Cause he just denies making a lot of money.

61
00:03:31.710 --> 00:03:34.560
Now in some ways we don't know if he's not telling the truth here.

62
00:03:34.561 --> 00:03:37.260
Maybe he wasn't making money. On the other hand,

63
00:03:37.261 --> 00:03:39.390
he lied to us at the beginning of the conversation.

64
00:03:39.570 --> 00:03:42.270
And this is exactly what a scammer would say.

65
00:03:42.510 --> 00:03:46.410
If they were afraid that you were going to go to the police or report them or

66
00:03:46.411 --> 00:03:49.350
anything like that, of course he's going to go, Oh yeah, I I'm not,

67
00:03:49.351 --> 00:03:51.900
I didn't make any money. I don't do it anymore. He says,

68
00:03:51.901 --> 00:03:55.740
now all he does is he trades trades online,

69
00:03:56.370 --> 00:03:58.200
which is stupid. As you guys know,

70
00:03:58.201 --> 00:03:59.790
you're not going to make a lot of money doing that.

71
00:03:59.791 --> 00:04:03.510
So he's probably still scamming. That's just my guess,

72
00:04:03.570 --> 00:04:06.540
but I'm not going to try to confront him on this because frankly,

73
00:04:07.290 --> 00:04:09.690
I don't think that's a productive conversation to have. Instead.

74
00:04:09.691 --> 00:04:13.950
I try to turn it and make it about scams in Nigeria in general.

75
00:04:14.130 --> 00:04:16.710
What do you thinks about the morality? Because my question is,

76
00:04:17.520 --> 00:04:21.600
do you guys care that you're scamming people? So I'll, uh,

77
00:04:21.601 --> 00:04:25.980
scroll down to that part of the conversation cause he just kind of denies it.

78
00:04:26.010 --> 00:04:30.330
And so I go, how deep did these scams go? He's trying to say, Oh,

79
00:04:30.331 --> 00:04:33.510
you should check out this trader. I don't care. And so he goes, honestly, bro,

80
00:04:33.511 --> 00:04:36.150
I can't really say, but there are a lot of greedy people out there.

81
00:04:36.151 --> 00:04:40.770
One thing I can assure you as a fact is that everyone you see on Bitcoin on

82
00:04:40.771 --> 00:04:42.150
Instagram is a scammer.

83
00:04:42.360 --> 00:04:45.420
Whether the person posted a photo or commented under that photo. Okay. True.

84
00:04:45.870 --> 00:04:49.140
True. Honestly true. And so then finally he's like, okay,

85
00:04:49.200 --> 00:04:53.760
I understand how wicked it is to ruin someone's life through scam. Okay.

86
00:04:53.940 --> 00:04:57.600
So he's kind of confessing a little bit, you know, it's like,

87
00:04:58.710 --> 00:05:03.450
I understand I'll wake. It is, but then you do it. Like what?

88
00:05:03.540 --> 00:05:07.410
I mean, come on buddy. Why would you do it? If you know? Well that it's,

89
00:05:07.710 --> 00:05:10.650
you're saying it's wicked. Okay. Then he says,

90
00:05:10.651 --> 00:05:14.700
but why would someone invest with a stranger in the first place that promises

91
00:05:14.701 --> 00:05:19.380
dubious returns, bro? I find it hard to give anyone money online.

92
00:05:20.370 --> 00:05:23.010
Uh, yeah. You find it hard to get people in money online.

93
00:05:23.011 --> 00:05:25.260
Maybe that's cause you're a scammer. So I said,

94
00:05:25.261 --> 00:05:27.660
I wonder that myself many times probably because the people who do this are

95
00:05:28.020 --> 00:05:30.540
expert schemers and know how to convince people with social Brown.

96
00:05:30.990 --> 00:05:34.140
And I show him evidence of that, him doing that basically tricking people.

97
00:05:34.230 --> 00:05:35.820
And I say stuff like this is how people get trapped.

98
00:05:35.821 --> 00:05:37.290
They see the social proof and think it's legit.

99
00:05:37.590 --> 00:05:42.450
That's how Ponzi schemes make money. Like of course this guy.

100
00:05:42.451 --> 00:05:44.100
I mean, if you're in the industry,

101
00:05:44.160 --> 00:05:48.870
like from my side of trying to bust these guys or you're a scammer, of course,

102
00:05:48.871 --> 00:05:49.501
you're going to say, well,

103
00:05:49.501 --> 00:05:52.380
you can't trust anyone online because this is the stuff you look at all.

104
00:05:53.280 --> 00:05:57.770
But he's neglecting the fact that most people are not like scammers.

105
00:05:58.280 --> 00:06:00.490
And you know, in the comments section of my last video,

106
00:06:00.730 --> 00:06:02.380
I'm going to have to pull up a few examples of this.

107
00:06:02.381 --> 00:06:05.680
But I had a bunch of comments basically saying that this guy,

108
00:06:05.830 --> 00:06:08.350
all his excuses about why he had to do that,

109
00:06:09.220 --> 00:06:12.100
they're just lies because we apparently have a bunch of people, uh,

110
00:06:12.130 --> 00:06:15.190
in our comment section that are Nigerian, but they basically goes,

111
00:06:15.191 --> 00:06:17.860
it's sad that a lot of people support them. You scammers in Nigeria,

112
00:06:17.861 --> 00:06:19.060
they're called Yahoo boys.

113
00:06:19.120 --> 00:06:22.810
A lot of Nigerians don't see anything wrong with it because they see it as they

114
00:06:22.870 --> 00:06:24.580
are taking money from people that are rich.

115
00:06:24.610 --> 00:06:29.140
So it's not bad or anything in some of them point out that even they're like a

116
00:06:29.141 --> 00:06:31.360
parent currently from rich parts of the country,

117
00:06:31.390 --> 00:06:34.360
or at least they're saying that they're saying they're upper middle class or

118
00:06:34.361 --> 00:06:36.940
went to some really good schools because they have written English.

119
00:06:37.150 --> 00:06:39.700
They've been wealthy and have been wealthy for a long time.

120
00:06:40.060 --> 00:06:42.250
And so the psychology they use here is a,

121
00:06:42.310 --> 00:06:46.390
just a justification method mechanism that they can only use with foreigners.

122
00:06:46.420 --> 00:06:48.970
Nigerians would call BS on the reasoning. So yeah,

123
00:06:49.000 --> 00:06:53.800
it's important to include that as we go forward with this because like he does,

124
00:06:53.830 --> 00:06:56.410
he is the little bit slick here and he's trying to say, Oh yeah,

125
00:06:56.411 --> 00:06:58.420
I totally understood. I didn't even make money with it.

126
00:06:58.421 --> 00:07:01.510
I don't even do it anymore. I think a lot of, uh,

127
00:07:01.540 --> 00:07:05.350
people in the comment section from blast video and this video are going to call

128
00:07:05.351 --> 00:07:08.410
BS on that because I don't believe it. I don't think they believe it.

129
00:07:08.500 --> 00:07:10.660
And basically, yeah. So for a long time here,

130
00:07:10.661 --> 00:07:11.800
I'm not even gonna go through all of them.

131
00:07:11.830 --> 00:07:14.860
I'm not even to give them the time of day on this because he's just basically

132
00:07:14.861 --> 00:07:17.770
saying the whole time that I'm, I'm not making any money.

133
00:07:18.100 --> 00:07:19.870
And then this is pretty funny. He goes,

134
00:07:19.871 --> 00:07:21.850
can I refer you to the stock's chat room?

135
00:07:21.851 --> 00:07:24.940
He's talking about the trader that he likes. He's like,

136
00:07:24.941 --> 00:07:28.720
can I refer you so I can get a referral as if,

137
00:07:30.280 --> 00:07:32.390
as if we're going to join. He's trying to scam me in,

138
00:07:32.670 --> 00:07:37.270
in the conversation where I have the Friday gap. What is this guy doing?

139
00:07:38.290 --> 00:07:41.440
And I was like, yeah, sure. Just to have a few more questions for you. First.

140
00:07:41.680 --> 00:07:44.410
Number one, was it the morality that got you to stop stocks,

141
00:07:44.411 --> 00:07:47.680
colleges and fair David Farris FX? Or was it the fact that he wasn't,

142
00:07:47.710 --> 00:07:51.340
it wasn't working? Number two is everyone in Nigeria afraid of SARS?

143
00:07:51.341 --> 00:07:53.860
I've read up on them. They almost seem like terrorists.

144
00:07:53.890 --> 00:07:57.670
They just got some sketchy motivations. He laughs at that, I say what?

145
00:07:58.120 --> 00:08:02.830
He goes stock's college, isn't a scam. David Farris. That's a total lie. Okay.

146
00:08:02.860 --> 00:08:04.180
Again, this guy's lying.

147
00:08:04.210 --> 00:08:06.970
He's been caught multiple times already in this conversation line.

148
00:08:07.210 --> 00:08:08.740
But that also is alight stocks.

149
00:08:08.741 --> 00:08:12.310
College talks about needing David Farris for the scam.

150
00:08:12.311 --> 00:08:14.470
So of course he was scamming. He talks about scamming,

151
00:08:15.040 --> 00:08:16.540
but he says David verse was because it was,

152
00:08:16.690 --> 00:08:19.240
they take account of a different individual and it wasn't working out because

153
00:08:19.241 --> 00:08:23.650
people knew it was kind of fishy to invest $500 and receive 20,000 in a month.

154
00:08:23.710 --> 00:08:25.360
Again, we don't have any verification of that.

155
00:08:25.870 --> 00:08:29.470
There's a saying that SARS are actually angry because they miss the opportunity

156
00:08:29.471 --> 00:08:33.190
to scam in their days. So they catch young boys and collect money from them.

157
00:08:33.310 --> 00:08:34.630
You did not hear this from me.

158
00:08:34.660 --> 00:08:38.320
And the interesting thing is that I think there's some evidence for this of SARS

159
00:08:38.321 --> 00:08:41.800
being very corrupt because multiple people contacted me about it.

160
00:08:41.800 --> 00:08:45.070
And they say SARS, the division of the police, that tackle robbery.

161
00:08:45.071 --> 00:08:48.760
But they found out that it makes no sense chasing robbers and risking their

162
00:08:48.761 --> 00:08:49.420
lives.

163
00:08:49.420 --> 00:08:53.260
They simply stop and search youngsters knowing they could make money easily.

164
00:08:53.440 --> 00:08:57.090
This is because they can simply call a scammer and most people would believe.

165
00:08:57.300 --> 00:08:58.650
And when they catch real scammers,

166
00:08:58.651 --> 00:09:02.100
they simply collect as much funds as they can and release them back into the

167
00:09:02.101 --> 00:09:04.290
wild. Basically in Nigeria,

168
00:09:04.291 --> 00:09:08.550
you can apparently stop and search without a warrant or cause. So that's,

169
00:09:08.551 --> 00:09:12.330
what's interesting is like, he's kind of right about SARS being a bit of a scam.

170
00:09:12.630 --> 00:09:16.020
Uh, cause we've heard it from multiple people now. And he's saying like, look,

171
00:09:16.080 --> 00:09:17.280
they shared amongst themselves,

172
00:09:17.281 --> 00:09:20.460
the government doesn't pay them as much as they can make from young scammers or

173
00:09:20.461 --> 00:09:24.300
rich people doing well in the country. Like they have a job to catch scammers.

174
00:09:24.870 --> 00:09:25.860
Bail is their side hustle.

175
00:09:26.810 --> 00:09:29.600
<v 2>Which is insane. Um.</v>

176
00:09:29.690 --> 00:09:33.020
<v 0>And then he goes, please, please leave stocks. College is out of this. There,</v>

177
00:09:33.021 --> 00:09:37.730
this is legit. People do that, bro. We've got them in DMS, scamming people.

178
00:09:37.731 --> 00:09:39.800
What are you talking about again? Uh,

179
00:09:39.801 --> 00:09:42.050
I think he was just covering for his buddy here and he goes,

180
00:09:42.051 --> 00:09:43.070
that's why I mentioned greed.

181
00:09:43.071 --> 00:09:45.470
There are people greedier than you can imagine that want to get rich quick.

182
00:09:45.980 --> 00:09:48.890
They're greed leads them to loss of money, not the scammer. Okay.

183
00:09:51.290 --> 00:09:56.210
Bravo for the biggest mental gymnastics in the world. Oh, it's not my fault.

184
00:09:56.390 --> 00:10:00.230
They're a lot losing money. Yeah, it is your fault. So then he goes, man,

185
00:10:00.290 --> 00:10:02.570
I'm trying to take time to go into details for you.

186
00:10:02.571 --> 00:10:05.540
And I ain't even getting paid. Time is money. Yo

187
00:10:07.060 --> 00:10:08.630
blessed me with funds, bro. Dude,

188
00:10:11.930 --> 00:10:16.010
scam into the better end bro. I'm probably broker than you.

189
00:10:16.011 --> 00:10:17.300
Like I don't know what you're talking about,

190
00:10:17.420 --> 00:10:21.320
but then our scammer here actually starts to get insightful. He goes,

191
00:10:21.350 --> 00:10:24.230
if you're looking for a business, you'll find a business.

192
00:10:24.290 --> 00:10:26.540
If you're looking for a get rich, you'll find it.

193
00:10:26.720 --> 00:10:30.020
The scam that is actually true.

194
00:10:30.230 --> 00:10:33.590
There are victims who they get themselves in these situations because they are

195
00:10:33.591 --> 00:10:37.310
actually actively looking for way to get rich quick and it just doesn't exist.

196
00:10:37.550 --> 00:10:40.790
And he goes on. There's nothing that can be done. Even if it gets exposed.

197
00:10:40.791 --> 00:10:42.350
He's talking about Nigerian scams.

198
00:10:42.650 --> 00:10:45.590
People have been getting scammed since the 1970s check the history.

199
00:10:45.591 --> 00:10:46.670
It didn't start overnight.

200
00:10:46.820 --> 00:10:49.970
What needs to be reformed is the mindset of the youths.

201
00:10:50.270 --> 00:10:53.960
We have kids in Nigeria who were thinking of scamming because of no money.

202
00:10:54.230 --> 00:10:59.180
I saw a 16 year old boy or younger boy today with an iPhone 11 pro max.

203
00:10:59.390 --> 00:11:02.930
I knew straight away that it was a result of a successful scams or fraud.

204
00:11:03.170 --> 00:11:05.090
The music in the country promotes scams.

205
00:11:05.330 --> 00:11:08.210
The government promotes scams indirectly to their actions.

206
00:11:08.211 --> 00:11:11.120
So does the police and everyone else it'll make a good story,

207
00:11:11.121 --> 00:11:13.910
but I'll introduce more youths into scams. If you choose to go with it.

208
00:11:14.510 --> 00:11:17.990
Now I disagree with that. I think education is the key.

209
00:11:17.991 --> 00:11:21.250
I think sunlight is the best disinfectant aside.

210
00:11:21.251 --> 00:11:24.320
Totally disagree with him there. But I just follow up like,

211
00:11:24.530 --> 00:11:28.610
can you elaborate on that idea that the government and music promote scams and

212
00:11:28.611 --> 00:11:29.240
he says,

213
00:11:29.240 --> 00:11:33.170
youths will figure out that scammers are really successful and we'll indulge in

214
00:11:33.171 --> 00:11:36.410
it. They believe they can scam all their lives without consequence.

215
00:11:36.411 --> 00:11:37.610
That's the mindset, bro.

216
00:11:37.970 --> 00:11:41.660
I believe the only solution is the reformation of the African people.

217
00:11:41.900 --> 00:11:45.710
The reason they scam is that because they don't know who they are amongst

218
00:11:45.711 --> 00:11:48.890
themselves. Dude is anyone hearing like some, uh,

219
00:11:49.220 --> 00:11:52.310
patriotic music backing here? There's a pretty good speech,

220
00:11:53.650 --> 00:11:56.320
honestly, pretty good speech for a scammer.

221
00:11:56.740 --> 00:11:59.710
Therefore it's safe to say that the government is scamming its citizens.

222
00:12:00.220 --> 00:12:03.370
The youths have seen that and they don't want to be slaves underneath a greedy

223
00:12:03.371 --> 00:12:04.180
government.

224
00:12:04.180 --> 00:12:07.870
Therefore they decided to attack everyone and make money any way they can.

225
00:12:08.140 --> 00:12:10.990
The youths are only reciprocating what's being done to them in their country.

226
00:12:11.400 --> 00:12:15.560
<v 3>Like it's not.</v>

227
00:12:15.660 --> 00:12:20.400
<v 0>A bad line of reasoning, but it's also trying to absolve yourself.</v>

228
00:12:20.430 --> 00:12:25.350
It's clearly so self justifying and self mode motivated.

229
00:12:25.950 --> 00:12:30.090
But I wanted to say, I mean, he has a point. He says so, uh, from within,

230
00:12:30.091 --> 00:12:34.350
so without worldwide scams in Nigeria is a reflection of what's really going on

231
00:12:34.351 --> 00:12:37.320
in the country in Nigeria. Everyone's scammed each other.

232
00:12:37.560 --> 00:12:41.490
It baffles me to this date. We'll have to talk to you later. I have to go now.

233
00:12:41.640 --> 00:12:44.880
And that's a, the conversation. I mean, that's, that's pretty much it.

234
00:12:46.410 --> 00:12:47.550
<v 3>Interesting stuff.</v>

235
00:12:49.380 --> 00:12:51.090
<v 0>I mean, I don't know what you guys think of that.</v>

236
00:12:51.120 --> 00:12:54.780
How much does the government shape the scamming culture?

237
00:12:55.110 --> 00:12:58.920
Very interested to hear what you think my guess is this will be a polarizing

238
00:12:59.250 --> 00:13:01.680
interview and let me know what you think of the comments below.

239
00:13:02.790 --> 00:13:06.870
<v 3>Don't forget to smash like and subscribe. Thank you.</v>

240
00:13:37.980 --> 00:13:37.980
