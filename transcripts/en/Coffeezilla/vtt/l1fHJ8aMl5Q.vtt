1
00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:03.030
<v 0>Ladies and gentlemen, I'm excited for this one today.</v>

2
00:00:03.031 --> 00:00:06.450
We're talking about a conversation that was leaked to me, uh,

3
00:00:06.470 --> 00:00:07.800
via an anonymous tip.

4
00:00:08.090 --> 00:00:13.040
And it's a conversation between two scammers and it allows us to rare look into

5
00:00:13.041 --> 00:00:16.910
how they think, how you can spot them. And more importantly,

6
00:00:16.940 --> 00:00:19.520
the kind of trash that's being allowed,

7
00:00:19.521 --> 00:00:22.910
promulgated push on Instagram all the time.

8
00:00:22.911 --> 00:00:26.390
People trying to get you to hand over your money in a new way.

9
00:00:26.420 --> 00:00:28.340
You guys all know about the Nigerian Prince,

10
00:00:28.341 --> 00:00:31.790
but you don't know about a lot of these investment scams.

11
00:00:31.820 --> 00:00:34.130
Now this is going to be a two part series because,

12
00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:37.850
because today we're talking about the inside. Look at that, their DMS,

13
00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:39.950
their conversation, when no one's watching.

14
00:00:40.190 --> 00:00:44.390
The second is a confrontation between myself and the scammer,

15
00:00:44.391 --> 00:00:47.570
where I try to get to the heart of what this person is doing,

16
00:00:47.571 --> 00:00:52.310
how they feel about the scam and ultimately a scammer's perspective

17
00:00:52.730 --> 00:00:55.610
on the victims of a scam. It's fascinating.

18
00:00:55.611 --> 00:00:58.400
I think you will find it very interesting if you like psychology,

19
00:00:58.670 --> 00:01:03.170
if you like any kind of like true crime stuff, this is an insane inside.

20
00:01:03.171 --> 00:01:06.950
Look at this. Um, and you rarely get that. So starting off,

21
00:01:07.010 --> 00:01:10.790
let's talk about who's involved. There are two people, David Ferris, FX,

22
00:01:10.820 --> 00:01:13.160
which is actually a cover. That's not his real name.

23
00:01:13.220 --> 00:01:17.600
This is a fake account that is made to lure investors in to invest with this

24
00:01:17.601 --> 00:01:21.440
person between this guy and another guy named stocks college.

25
00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:24.710
Here it is Ray here. It's number one, stock market training program,

26
00:01:24.711 --> 00:01:27.620
500 plus satisfied students, top rated funds. Okay.

27
00:01:27.621 --> 00:01:29.990
Trying to get this social proof going on, right?

28
00:01:30.110 --> 00:01:32.600
They're constantly posting about trade, stuff like that.

29
00:01:32.750 --> 00:01:36.410
You see accounts like this all the time. Now let me say right off the bat.

30
00:01:36.411 --> 00:01:40.790
One of these accounts has since been leading. That would be David Farris, FX,

31
00:01:40.791 --> 00:01:44.450
which is why I wanted to compare it to a similar, um,

32
00:01:44.510 --> 00:01:49.070
probably almost identical account called invest with Hilda

33
00:01:49.250 --> 00:01:53.150
FX, very similar Forex expert binary, trader entrepreneur,

34
00:01:53.180 --> 00:01:57.890
all this kind of stuff. Uh, DME let's earn huge profits, dah, dah, dah.

35
00:01:58.040 --> 00:02:01.910
So this is basically what David Farris was doing is posting daily about Forex

36
00:02:01.911 --> 00:02:05.000
all these trades, all this money, but that's who we're dealing with.

37
00:02:05.030 --> 00:02:09.740
So let's set the tone. It starts off. I hope our conversation don't get leaked.

38
00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:12.830
We should chat somewhere. Private. Do you have WhatsApp?

39
00:02:12.860 --> 00:02:16.550
I'm going to blur out that number for privacy reasons. And this guy goes,

40
00:02:16.551 --> 00:02:19.550
what happened to your personal page? I can't find it blocked you.

41
00:02:19.790 --> 00:02:22.910
Why would you do that, bro? You keep changing IgE accounts.

42
00:02:22.911 --> 00:02:25.910
You making it hard to do business with you. Safety bro.

43
00:02:25.970 --> 00:02:27.890
My main page never changes.

44
00:02:27.920 --> 00:02:31.580
So this David Ferris FX cameras basically saying I have two accounts,

45
00:02:31.610 --> 00:02:35.540
one for the scam. One that's completely unassociated and stocks.

46
00:02:35.541 --> 00:02:38.390
College is upset because he can't get ahold of him. But David Farris,

47
00:02:38.480 --> 00:02:39.500
his reasoning is pretty clear.

48
00:02:39.710 --> 00:02:44.240
Imagine police stops me and go through my Instagram I'm doc's college

49
00:02:44.241 --> 00:02:48.290
response Lowell. They can't go through your Instagram. David fares, what?

50
00:02:48.410 --> 00:02:52.070
Google SARS, Nigeria. They kill scammers, bro. Now,

51
00:02:52.071 --> 00:02:55.790
for those of you wondering SARS is the special anti robbery squad,

52
00:02:56.030 --> 00:02:57.920
which is a Nigerian based police force,

53
00:02:58.130 --> 00:03:02.050
which has some extremely controversial methods of, uh,

54
00:03:02.380 --> 00:03:06.040
of enforcement. As you can see here, they've been linked to acts of extortion,

55
00:03:06.041 --> 00:03:07.690
torture, framing, and blackmail,

56
00:03:07.900 --> 00:03:11.050
and basically a lot of people in Nigeria want them shut down.

57
00:03:11.080 --> 00:03:15.940
This guy's afraid of SARS. The conversation goes on, okay man. Anyways,

58
00:03:15.970 --> 00:03:19.960
they can go through your WhatsApp too. Then David Farris response,

59
00:03:20.260 --> 00:03:22.870
I've got two phones. One of them is scammed free,

60
00:03:22.990 --> 00:03:27.310
which is extremely interesting. And this guy feels pretty sophisticated, uh,

61
00:03:27.370 --> 00:03:30.520
compared to probably a lot of scammers who don't go through all these hoops to

62
00:03:30.521 --> 00:03:34.360
try to stay, you know, clean as far as their public image is concerned.

63
00:03:34.540 --> 00:03:37.510
But then this guy goes, I dunno, bro, you're doing too much and I'm confused.

64
00:03:37.570 --> 00:03:42.490
I need you for the scam. This is stock's college, Instagram page.

65
00:03:42.520 --> 00:03:46.600
That is still up. Still trying to, I guess, get people to invest. I don't know.

66
00:03:46.870 --> 00:03:50.530
Do you want to make money or not? He says, yeah, I want to make money.

67
00:03:50.740 --> 00:03:53.680
But without using my official page, dude, I don't understand.

68
00:03:53.681 --> 00:03:57.430
I'm using Robert DiMillo's picture on a new page. Nice man.

69
00:03:57.610 --> 00:04:01.900
I need to make multiple IgE accounts and post on all of them grow all of them.

70
00:04:02.200 --> 00:04:03.520
Yeah, you can do that.

71
00:04:03.580 --> 00:04:06.910
So they're talking about diversifying for when they have to burn one of these

72
00:04:06.911 --> 00:04:10.930
accounts. You want multiple. So moving on, they go. Yeah. Great job, man.

73
00:04:10.931 --> 00:04:15.250
When someone messaged you, Bitcoin, what do you do? David Farris response.

74
00:04:15.280 --> 00:04:19.240
I give them a good format. Talk to them like a company or an organization,

75
00:04:19.480 --> 00:04:21.940
lead them on and give them everything legit.

76
00:04:21.970 --> 00:04:26.290
Because I know the one to verify all I'm saying it will be them that will ask to

77
00:04:26.291 --> 00:04:30.280
send their money. How's everything going? Great over here,

78
00:04:30.580 --> 00:04:31.600
your in's chilling man.

79
00:04:31.601 --> 00:04:35.560
Trying to collect as many investors as I can't any word from the Nevine guy.

80
00:04:35.590 --> 00:04:39.550
I guess that's one of their leads. He then sends them some car. And then, uh,

81
00:04:39.551 --> 00:04:42.460
we have our scammer going last night.

82
00:04:42.461 --> 00:04:45.370
I was so visualizing myself in ask class bins.

83
00:04:45.371 --> 00:04:49.120
Now let's stop for a second and say, this is what all scammers do.

84
00:04:49.121 --> 00:04:53.410
All of them buy very much into this manifestation idea.

85
00:04:53.410 --> 00:04:55.600
They think that if they think it, they will do it.

86
00:04:55.630 --> 00:04:58.360
They get it all from the secret. They all believe in it like totally.

87
00:04:58.390 --> 00:05:01.420
So you'll see a lot of that on this channel. David Farris says,

88
00:05:01.421 --> 00:05:04.660
delete your comment, bro. I guess he's referring to some kind of post,

89
00:05:04.690 --> 00:05:07.270
maybe on his private Instagram. I deleted it.

90
00:05:07.480 --> 00:05:11.920
Why you want me to leave the comment law? I just feel in case your followers,

91
00:05:11.921 --> 00:05:14.140
see it, they shouldn't know your movement. So again,

92
00:05:14.141 --> 00:05:17.380
we find David Farris is constantly trying to elude detection.

93
00:05:17.381 --> 00:05:20.470
He doesn't want anyone to see who he is later in the conversation.

94
00:05:20.471 --> 00:05:24.370
We see more of this sort of paranoid behavior. Cool man, bro,

95
00:05:24.371 --> 00:05:27.490
did you block the persuade guide? LOL? Yeah, of course I blocked.

96
00:05:27.520 --> 00:05:31.270
Apparently this is probably someone who invested with them, asking for returns.

97
00:05:31.810 --> 00:05:33.730
Uh, and they just block them. That's how this stuff works.

98
00:05:33.730 --> 00:05:37.540
You invest and they keep you on the hook until you ask for your money back.

99
00:05:37.541 --> 00:05:41.860
They promise you these super high returns. Uh, and when you do ask for it back,

100
00:05:41.920 --> 00:05:46.600
they block you LOL for real ha the worst is still to come.

101
00:05:46.750 --> 00:05:51.580
Who the is that? Lose it though. bro. Your Savage. No dude.

102
00:05:51.790 --> 00:05:52.840
You're a scammer.

103
00:05:53.500 --> 00:05:58.340
And now all of your dirty laundry is being exposed. How about that

104
00:06:01.070 --> 00:06:04.940
jokes on you guys. Now stocks college says I'm going to block him too. Yup.

105
00:06:04.970 --> 00:06:07.520
Block is tease the past. So this guy goes,

106
00:06:07.790 --> 00:06:10.790
stocks college says I'm going to grow five new pages and buy established pages

107
00:06:10.791 --> 00:06:14.330
and cash out, bro. Each account we can make easy.

108
00:06:14.690 --> 00:06:17.780
80 K they're talking about scamming, raise 30 to 40 commission,

109
00:06:17.781 --> 00:06:21.110
30 to 40 and extra like you did with persuade here and there.

110
00:06:21.140 --> 00:06:24.500
And that's it burn the account. So this is the mechanism behind this stuff.

111
00:06:24.501 --> 00:06:26.540
And I hope you guys are thinking, wow,

112
00:06:26.630 --> 00:06:30.710
I'm never going to invest in an Instagram investor ever.

113
00:06:31.010 --> 00:06:33.710
And you shouldn't because the chances are they're scamming.

114
00:06:33.740 --> 00:06:36.290
Just like these people are, look at what this guy's talking about.

115
00:06:36.291 --> 00:06:40.610
We can do three to four a year. May be or more not sure.

116
00:06:40.640 --> 00:06:43.820
Let's see how it goes. Different pages, just like stock college,

117
00:06:43.850 --> 00:06:47.270
just different name and brand. I will post daily content on those.

118
00:06:47.271 --> 00:06:50.300
Like I do here, grow organic following and people then.

119
00:06:50.410 --> 00:06:53.560
<v 1>Cash out when I do a fundraise. So again, they post.</v>

120
00:06:53.580 --> 00:06:55.780
<v 0>A ton of content and they say, guys, I'm starting.</v>

121
00:06:55.780 --> 00:06:59.200
<v 1>A fund. I'm going to make all this money. You're going to make 200%.</v>

122
00:06:59.201 --> 00:07:01.360
You're going to make 500% and they steal it.

123
00:07:01.840 --> 00:07:04.300
And here's what we're going to see a post from stocks,

124
00:07:04.301 --> 00:07:08.200
college of this scam and action. So they put up these stories.

125
00:07:08.260 --> 00:07:11.350
This is a stock's college, almost full.

126
00:07:11.351 --> 00:07:16.090
Thank you to everyone who invested. And it says I'm raising 30 K to trade.

127
00:07:16.240 --> 00:07:19.450
And once I reach it, it's kept. Don't ask me after please,

128
00:07:19.570 --> 00:07:23.200
50 50 split on these daily profits you see on my page.

129
00:07:23.201 --> 00:07:27.880
So this is what he's talking about right here. $13,000, a thousand dollars.

130
00:07:28.120 --> 00:07:30.580
He's talking about all these, uh, pages,

131
00:07:30.581 --> 00:07:32.770
supposedly where he's making all this money.

132
00:07:33.220 --> 00:07:35.980
He's saying you could split the profits. Of course, this is all a lie.

133
00:07:36.010 --> 00:07:39.580
He's gonna burn the account eventually. But this is how he raises the money.

134
00:07:39.850 --> 00:07:42.640
And he's talking here to this guy, Mr. Persuade,

135
00:07:42.641 --> 00:07:46.630
who they were talking about earlier about blocking and here it says, bro,

136
00:07:46.631 --> 00:07:49.930
if Robert gives me my profits, I'm in, in other words,

137
00:07:49.931 --> 00:07:53.110
this guy's already invested and he wants to invest again,

138
00:07:53.111 --> 00:07:56.380
but he hasn't received his profits back. So he's saying, Hey, pay me first.

139
00:07:56.440 --> 00:08:00.040
And then I'll join your new fund that you're fundraising. Right?

140
00:08:00.100 --> 00:08:04.420
And what do they do? They block the guy. As you can see, laugh, laugh, laugh,

141
00:08:04.421 --> 00:08:07.270
laugh, laugh. Look at these scumbags. Did,

142
00:08:07.570 --> 00:08:12.160
can you imagine doing this to somebody's dish looks so legit.

143
00:08:12.310 --> 00:08:16.690
He still can't find the scam in it. They're talking about Mr. Persuade trust,

144
00:08:16.691 --> 00:08:19.840
bro. We are crazy. And this is really insidious. Okay.

145
00:08:19.841 --> 00:08:24.220
This is where these guys do understand psychology really well. He says,

146
00:08:24.340 --> 00:08:27.280
let it seem like he's the only one who hasn't received his profits.

147
00:08:27.281 --> 00:08:31.630
The reason why this business will hold well is the fact that each person will

148
00:08:31.631 --> 00:08:34.630
think that they are the only one that have problems.

149
00:08:34.720 --> 00:08:38.170
Especially when they see you posting profits and payouts to different clients.

150
00:08:38.200 --> 00:08:40.900
These is sick guys.

151
00:08:40.930 --> 00:08:45.040
This is how the scam works is gaslighting.

152
00:08:45.070 --> 00:08:48.670
It's fakery. It's lying. This is what they do.

153
00:08:48.671 --> 00:08:53.500
They're experts at it. And again, where does this thrive on Instagram,

154
00:08:54.010 --> 00:08:57.870
where you don't have to be to post all these profits to say you're such a

155
00:08:57.871 --> 00:08:59.400
millionaire trader. If they're posting.

156
00:08:59.720 --> 00:09:03.320
<v 0>Screenshots of the trader. I mean, I don't know if I showed you guys this,</v>

157
00:09:03.321 --> 00:09:06.350
but stocks, college has an image of their trader. That's not okay.

158
00:09:06.410 --> 00:09:08.390
<v 1>Actually, the guy look at this,</v>

159
00:09:08.570 --> 00:09:12.530
they say senior trader located in Toronto, Canada. No,

160
00:09:12.531 --> 00:09:14.630
he's not this guy. Isn't real.

161
00:09:15.080 --> 00:09:19.520
This guy is a fake profile to lure you in. Again,

162
00:09:19.820 --> 00:09:23.090
it's all manipulated. It's all a fraud.

163
00:09:23.720 --> 00:09:26.270
And here's where the scam continues. Look at this.

164
00:09:26.630 --> 00:09:30.470
Every time a person is ready to pay out, I'll send them to you. So.

165
00:09:30.470 --> 00:09:32.720
<v 0>Like I said, David Farris is sort of like.</v>

166
00:09:32.990 --> 00:09:36.500
<v 1>Uh, the end man, stocks college is the middleman. He says,</v>

167
00:09:36.620 --> 00:09:39.620
make sure to get a testimonial and everything before you block them,

168
00:09:39.621 --> 00:09:42.800
I can use that as content. So what they say is, before we pay you out,

169
00:09:43.010 --> 00:09:45.950
we need a testimony. People naively do it,

170
00:09:45.980 --> 00:09:49.070
thinking that they're going to about to get paid out like 500%.

171
00:09:49.280 --> 00:09:53.360
They post it as if they paid it out and then block that person.

172
00:09:53.361 --> 00:09:57.310
So they can't post anymore. This does two things like.

173
00:09:57.500 --> 00:10:01.790
<v 0>They're saying, first of all, it shows everybody else in the group. They think,</v>

174
00:10:01.880 --> 00:10:05.300
Oh yeah, people are getting paid out. No, they're not number two.

175
00:10:05.360 --> 00:10:09.470
It gaslights everybody thinking that they're the only one who didn't get paid

176
00:10:09.471 --> 00:10:10.340
out. Okay.

177
00:10:10.341 --> 00:10:13.190
So we're going to fast forward a little bit because some of these deems are

178
00:10:13.310 --> 00:10:16.640
uninteresting, bro, bro, bro, bro, that kind of stuff.

179
00:10:17.300 --> 00:10:19.400
Then they start talking about burning the account.

180
00:10:19.401 --> 00:10:22.490
Remember they're going to build a bunch of accounts like stocks, college,

181
00:10:22.790 --> 00:10:24.290
and then burn them. When they go,

182
00:10:24.350 --> 00:10:28.520
when basically they get caught out caught or you know too many investors get

183
00:10:28.521 --> 00:10:32.270
burned. So David Farris is talking to him. If you're going to burn it,

184
00:10:32.271 --> 00:10:35.300
it won't be now at all. Okay. I will see how it goes.

185
00:10:35.301 --> 00:10:38.840
I'm going to burden in three or four months. When everyone asks for payout,

186
00:10:39.050 --> 00:10:41.540
I'm going to do another fundraise in between this one.

187
00:10:41.690 --> 00:10:45.050
While I show people the investors accounts, profit, again,

188
00:10:45.140 --> 00:10:47.270
they haven't actually gotten the money,

189
00:10:47.420 --> 00:10:50.750
but it's like allegedly what's in their account. It's a big Ponzi scheme.

190
00:10:51.410 --> 00:10:53.230
Then this David Farris, hatches an idea,

191
00:10:53.250 --> 00:10:57.770
pay one or two of them to K and collect videos and screenshot and post it up.

192
00:10:58.070 --> 00:10:59.960
So then this guy's kind of getting, he goes, Oh,

193
00:10:59.990 --> 00:11:02.690
so whoever didn't get in will get in. Yes,

194
00:11:02.691 --> 00:11:05.840
they will invest again and bring more friends. Oh yeah.

195
00:11:05.900 --> 00:11:10.160
So it's almost like an undetectable Ponzi scheme plan your date and then pay

196
00:11:10.161 --> 00:11:14.240
investors who invested little, it's a small price to pay for the big gains.

197
00:11:14.241 --> 00:11:18.110
Since the other investors will be willing to pay the commission. So again,

198
00:11:18.140 --> 00:11:20.330
this is a kind of diabolical.

199
00:11:20.331 --> 00:11:23.930
What they're saying is anybody who invested a little, like a hundred dollars,

200
00:11:23.960 --> 00:11:27.410
maybe they're promising like 2000% returns, something crazy like that.

201
00:11:27.860 --> 00:11:30.980
You actually pay them out. The two K that they're owed,

202
00:11:31.130 --> 00:11:35.690
collect videos and then attract new investors. This is diabolical.

203
00:11:35.780 --> 00:11:38.540
And why this is important to note is that you might,

204
00:11:38.541 --> 00:11:40.490
may find an Instagram account.

205
00:11:40.670 --> 00:11:45.320
That's supposedly paying out investors that supposedly as real testimonials,

206
00:11:45.321 --> 00:11:48.740
right? You don't know that they're not doing this behind the scenes, right?

207
00:11:48.800 --> 00:11:53.560
Secretly only paying out a few burning everybody else to

208
00:11:53.561 --> 00:11:56.710
try to keep the Ponzi scheme going. A lot of people do that,

209
00:11:56.711 --> 00:11:59.440
especially scammers on Instagram. And again,

210
00:11:59.441 --> 00:12:04.060
look at how gleeful these people are. There's no morality here at all.

211
00:12:04.240 --> 00:12:08.200
There's no thought of we're ripping people off. We're ruining people's lives.

212
00:12:08.380 --> 00:12:10.060
Look at this. They're just so happy about it.

213
00:12:10.390 --> 00:12:13.600
We are controlling the narrative by having multiple outs. Nice.

214
00:12:13.780 --> 00:12:17.560
You're smart as hell. Perfect man. One guy gave me a hundred dollars.

215
00:12:17.620 --> 00:12:20.560
I'll give him $300 and they're laughing again, guys,

216
00:12:20.620 --> 00:12:23.440
this is a sickness affecting people who, number one,

217
00:12:23.441 --> 00:12:25.600
they might not have other prospects in life.

218
00:12:25.630 --> 00:12:26.980
Maybe that's why they feel the need to skip.

219
00:12:27.160 --> 00:12:30.970
But I think the other part of it is they watch how little of this stuff is

220
00:12:30.971 --> 00:12:35.440
prosecuted. How much does Instagram crack down on these accounts? Almost none.

221
00:12:36.340 --> 00:12:36.370
Uh,

222
00:12:36.370 --> 00:12:40.480
how much does Instagram take accountability for these actions or report them to

223
00:12:40.481 --> 00:12:45.040
law enforcement? Almost none. So when this happens, they're not scared.

224
00:12:45.100 --> 00:12:48.280
Look at this. They're just gleeful. Okay. Thanks bro. You're the guy helping me.

225
00:12:48.580 --> 00:12:50.020
You're my only partner. So good job.

226
00:12:50.050 --> 00:12:54.610
We have a huge future and that's basically it actually that's about where the

227
00:12:54.611 --> 00:12:57.760
conversation ends. So I hope you learned something.

228
00:12:57.761 --> 00:13:00.280
Let me know what you think in the comments below about content like this.

229
00:13:00.370 --> 00:13:04.000
I really enjoyed getting into the minds of these people and tomorrow we will not

230
00:13:04.001 --> 00:13:07.840
only be getting into the minds of this person. We are actually contacting him.

231
00:13:07.841 --> 00:13:10.930
I confronted David Ferris, eFax. He deleted his account,

232
00:13:11.080 --> 00:13:15.220
but I contacted his WhatsApp number and I just wanted to talk.

233
00:13:15.280 --> 00:13:17.080
Thanks for watching. And as always.

234
00:13:17.220 --> 00:13:21.270
