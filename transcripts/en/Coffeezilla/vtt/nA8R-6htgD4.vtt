00:00:00.450 --> 00:00:03.360
<v 0>Ladies and gentlemen, I'm retiring from YouTube. That's right. I'm done.</v>

2
00:00:03.720 --> 00:00:06.570
Susan's taken advantage of me for far too long.

3
00:00:06.600 --> 00:00:10.470
Been paying her way too much money and I'm sick of it, quite frankly.

4
00:00:10.830 --> 00:00:14.130
And I need to make this financial decision for me, for my family. Look,

5
00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:16.080
this $10 million studio it's expensive.

6
00:00:16.170 --> 00:00:19.500
The first mortgage payment came in and quite frankly, I am drowning in debt.

7
00:00:19.620 --> 00:00:22.680
And enough is enough guys. A man can only take so much before he,

8
00:00:22.830 --> 00:00:25.590
as the filings throw in the towel. But before I do it,

9
00:00:25.620 --> 00:00:30.270
I need to expose the biggest con artists in the entire fake guru

10
00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:32.610
industry. I've never talked about them because you know,

11
00:00:32.611 --> 00:00:34.260
I didn't want to burn any bridges.

12
00:00:34.650 --> 00:00:38.340
I knew that I wanted to be nice to these guys. I mean, it's not even just one.

13
00:00:38.580 --> 00:00:40.470
It's actually a group of three. Okay.

14
00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:43.380
Three people that I've never called out because I'm afraid they have big,

15
00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:46.260
big shot lawyers. Um, but it's finally time.

16
00:00:46.261 --> 00:00:50.890
I called them out and those three people are Tom Nashville's or

17
00:00:51.330 --> 00:00:52.163
Grinnellian Mike wouldn't.

18
00:00:52.740 --> 00:00:55.980
I know you guys thought we were all friendly and stuff like that,

19
00:00:56.400 --> 00:00:59.880
but I was really like a little mole inside their operation.

20
00:00:59.881 --> 00:01:01.860
I was only pretending so that I could later expose it,

21
00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:05.510
use them for who they really are. That's right. Bring the screen down, boys,

22
00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:07.370
Spencer Cornelia to start.

23
00:01:07.790 --> 00:01:10.850
Now you may know Spencer as a real estate investor,

24
00:01:10.851 --> 00:01:13.190
someone who's passionate about finance,

25
00:01:13.191 --> 00:01:17.960
but I see a Photoshop artist T he claims in his banner that he was on

26
00:01:17.961 --> 00:01:19.490
wheel of fortune, his name,

27
00:01:19.760 --> 00:01:23.060
but I looked through literally thousands of hours of footage and literally found

28
00:01:23.061 --> 00:01:26.510
no mentions of the name, Spencer Cornelia. Additionally,

29
00:01:26.511 --> 00:01:27.950
when you look at below this,

30
00:01:27.951 --> 00:01:32.480
I know a lot of people would miss this little detail, but it says guru killer,

31
00:01:32.870 --> 00:01:37.130
which rhymes? I don't know if you guys know this with coffee Zilla,

32
00:01:37.610 --> 00:01:42.110
which can only mean one thing. Spitzer. Cornelia may have blood on his hands.

33
00:01:42.111 --> 00:01:45.830
Guys. Wouldn't Caleb Maddix went missing. I always wondered. I mean,

34
00:01:45.831 --> 00:01:49.550
after my livestream, he said he was going to make daily videos. He never did.

35
00:01:49.910 --> 00:01:53.960
And I think at this point, even the police are asking, where is Kaitlin Maddix?

36
00:01:54.320 --> 00:01:57.500
And does the guru killer have anything to do with it?

37
00:01:57.800 --> 00:02:00.200
I don't know if Spencer did it,

38
00:02:01.100 --> 00:02:02.900
but let's just look in those eyes real quick.

39
00:02:02.901 --> 00:02:06.800
And I think we can make a pretty reasonable assumption. Next bridge.

40
00:02:06.920 --> 00:02:11.120
I'm burning Tom Nash. This man is a thumbnail plagiarist.

41
00:02:11.270 --> 00:02:15.980
He has one good thumbnail idea and proceeds to plagiarize it off himself

42
00:02:16.130 --> 00:02:19.490
for months with no attribution. Disgusting.

43
00:02:19.760 --> 00:02:23.240
Now I get it to the common man. You see six distinct thumbnails.

44
00:02:23.630 --> 00:02:28.580
I see six copies next. And this is, this is what actually hurts. Mike,

45
00:02:28.760 --> 00:02:31.400
when it right, many of you, including myself,

46
00:02:31.520 --> 00:02:33.230
are fooled by this guy for a very long time.

47
00:02:33.350 --> 00:02:37.010
Mike has a successful show called entrepreneur, bingo, I,

48
00:02:37.011 --> 00:02:39.950
myself and many others were a fan of this, uh,

49
00:02:40.100 --> 00:02:43.430
where he's hanging out in this gigantic office space.

50
00:02:43.431 --> 00:02:46.580
You see him as successful and you know, popular,

51
00:02:46.820 --> 00:02:51.470
but the truth is far more sinister. See, I was leaked by one of Mike's interns,

52
00:02:51.650 --> 00:02:53.120
this shocking photo.

53
00:02:54.350 --> 00:02:57.440
This is the real state of Contra preneur. Bingo.

54
00:02:57.950 --> 00:03:01.240
It's all been a green screen. We caught them boys.

55
00:03:01.330 --> 00:03:04.090
We caught them who would lie to their audience with something like this.

56
00:03:04.091 --> 00:03:04.871
Let me just ask you this.

57
00:03:04.871 --> 00:03:09.100
What kind of psycho would tell their audience months and months for weeks and

58
00:03:09.101 --> 00:03:12.040
weeks that they're somewhere. They're not, not me.

59
00:03:12.550 --> 00:03:13.900
I've never lied to you guys in my life.

60
00:03:13.930 --> 00:03:17.170
I've never been wrong about anything and literally never known it was green

61
00:03:17.380 --> 00:03:22.030
screen until the shocking footage came out. Um, Mike ex-post now guys,

62
00:03:22.031 --> 00:03:25.090
now that I've burned those bridges, there's no going back on this retirement.

63
00:03:25.091 --> 00:03:27.640
There's no way I could show my face in this circle again.

64
00:03:27.970 --> 00:03:30.790
So let's just go all the way through. Why am I retiring?

65
00:03:31.180 --> 00:03:34.720
Cause it's not just randomly, I'm not doing this for no reason.

66
00:03:34.960 --> 00:03:39.310
It's because I recently learned the truth about retirement,

67
00:03:39.311 --> 00:03:41.590
that people aren't going to tell you. Um, see,

68
00:03:41.620 --> 00:03:44.710
I watched Joshua flukes video on retirement. You may know him.

69
00:03:44.711 --> 00:03:48.580
He's been on the podcast before Josh has a very main stream.

70
00:03:48.990 --> 00:03:51.030
<v 1>View of retirement. Let's hear what it is.</v>

71
00:03:51.120 --> 00:03:56.010
This is what retirement actually looks like. This is what retirement looks like.

72
00:03:56.250 --> 00:03:59.040
<v 0>Ladies and gentlemen, this is what I used to believe about retirement.</v>

73
00:03:59.220 --> 00:04:03.660
That retirement means you're old, but that was back when I was a big, dumb,

74
00:04:03.661 --> 00:04:06.990
dumb, like Josh flu. And I didn't mean to expose them there, but Josh, sorry,

75
00:04:06.991 --> 00:04:10.380
you're in the cross ears right now. Everybody's getting it on retirement day.

76
00:04:10.410 --> 00:04:13.650
See Joshua fluke is totally wrong about retirement as are most people.

77
00:04:13.651 --> 00:04:18.210
Most people think of retirement as you save up money so that you can retire.

78
00:04:18.510 --> 00:04:23.010
I learned recently that you have to retire to make enough money to retire,

79
00:04:23.070 --> 00:04:24.690
which is why I'm retiring guys.

80
00:04:24.960 --> 00:04:28.770
Welcome to my retirement video and why you should retire. And yes,

81
00:04:28.771 --> 00:04:30.060
we're four minutes and 30 seconds in,

82
00:04:30.061 --> 00:04:32.460
and I'm just getting to the point of this video. But hold on guys,

83
00:04:32.461 --> 00:04:34.410
it's my retirement video. I can do it how I want.

84
00:04:34.800 --> 00:04:37.980
So this may be the most important little slide deck you've ever seen to

85
00:04:37.981 --> 00:04:40.740
retirement. One-on-one buy copies of it. Cause if you're in the old model,

86
00:04:41.040 --> 00:04:45.540
you probably think that retirement is for old people. And that's the mistake.

87
00:04:45.570 --> 00:04:50.550
This lie, this false narrative is being mostly propagated by one man,

88
00:04:51.060 --> 00:04:53.190
Joshua fluke, the YouTuber. Um,

89
00:04:53.220 --> 00:04:55.500
the truth is retirement's made to make you more money.

90
00:04:55.501 --> 00:04:58.380
And I know that's confusing to a lot of you. So let me explain.

91
00:04:58.381 --> 00:05:00.660
See the truth is I used to be negative towards retirement too.

92
00:05:00.661 --> 00:05:04.920
I mean like back in the day, a long time ago, I was Downing people who did this.

93
00:05:04.921 --> 00:05:08.790
I was hating on them. I was making fun of them and their taglines,

94
00:05:09.120 --> 00:05:12.870
but that's before I knew the truth guys, that's before I got enlightened,

95
00:05:12.960 --> 00:05:17.340
I used to propagate the, this poor mindset, this poor mentality, you know,

96
00:05:17.341 --> 00:05:21.000
and that's how you stay poor is by not retiring early, but luckily guys,

97
00:05:21.001 --> 00:05:23.730
I'm a non-stop learner. So eventually I figured it out.

98
00:05:23.760 --> 00:05:26.130
And it's also a great way to get job security guys,

99
00:05:26.160 --> 00:05:30.000
because this is the old saying goes, once you retire, you can never be fired.

100
00:05:30.060 --> 00:05:34.950
Now I want you guys to know also get arm yourself with evidence, as they say,

101
00:05:35.220 --> 00:05:38.160
because all the greats have done it. Listen, Connor McGregor show.

102
00:05:38.161 --> 00:05:41.640
You know who he is. He retired. He said, I have decided to retire young.

103
00:05:41.670 --> 00:05:43.200
Thanks for the cheese catches later.

104
00:05:43.230 --> 00:05:46.740
Now what happened years after he retired,

105
00:05:47.520 --> 00:05:48.840
after retiring from fighting,

106
00:05:48.841 --> 00:05:52.080
he made the most money he had ever made in his career fighting. Look,

107
00:05:52.081 --> 00:05:56.100
this is the face of a man making a lot of money. I know it may not look like it,

108
00:05:56.460 --> 00:05:58.580
but wow, this is the face of a winner.

109
00:05:59.270 --> 00:06:03.950
Now I know you're savvy and you want more evidence, fine evidence. Number two,

110
00:06:04.100 --> 00:06:06.380
we have Linus tech tips, ladies and gentlemen.

111
00:06:06.860 --> 00:06:10.310
This is a small little YouTuber who would thought of retiring 10 months ago.

112
00:06:10.340 --> 00:06:13.520
He announced it. He got millions of views. The video went viral, uh,

113
00:06:13.550 --> 00:06:16.610
because all of a sudden, everyone freaked out, Oh, he's retiring. He's retiring.

114
00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:19.610
Now. Look at him. He's the number one tech YouTuber.

115
00:06:19.880 --> 00:06:21.530
But maybe you're not into these YouTubers, right?

116
00:06:21.531 --> 00:06:22.880
You want to know about traditional media.

117
00:06:22.881 --> 00:06:26.330
Maybe you don't trust this new showbiz, right? You take a look at old showbiz.

118
00:06:26.360 --> 00:06:29.240
Jay Leno was about to be fired. So he retired.

119
00:06:29.540 --> 00:06:33.410
He said he was handing over the show to Conan. O'Brien good luck next week,

120
00:06:33.411 --> 00:06:38.330
my friend. And then he took it back. Yeah,

121
00:06:38.420 --> 00:06:42.320
I'll take the show back. Once you retire, you can never be fired guys.

122
00:06:42.500 --> 00:06:45.500
There are even people you may not have even known are retired and are successful

123
00:06:45.501 --> 00:06:49.550
because of it. This is Pewdie pie. I've already retired. He said,

124
00:06:49.880 --> 00:06:53.870
don't believe me, roll the clip. I'm already retired. Now. Look at him. Look,

125
00:06:54.230 --> 00:06:57.980
he's one of the biggest YouTubers. Now this is how you get successful. Guys.

126
00:06:58.220 --> 00:07:00.560
Other big YouTubers. You may know morgues,

127
00:07:00.620 --> 00:07:03.470
obviously one of the greats on YouTube, he retired.

128
00:07:04.330 --> 00:07:08.440
<v 2>I'm sorry to do this. I'm quit YouTube.</v>

129
00:07:13.030 --> 00:07:17.470
<v 0>Now look at him guys. This is just a pattern of behavior. I mean,</v>

130
00:07:17.471 --> 00:07:21.820
I don't mean to shake you guys up with these things, but as uncle Ben says,

131
00:07:21.821 --> 00:07:24.850
facts, don't care about your feelings. Now that just about covers it.

132
00:07:24.851 --> 00:07:29.170
But I just wanted to conclude for you guys a little bit here. Um, I am retiring,

133
00:07:29.260 --> 00:07:33.220
listen, that's fact number one, I had to do it for the sake of my career.

134
00:07:33.221 --> 00:07:36.610
I decided I was finally ready to get serious about working. So I had to quit.

135
00:07:37.000 --> 00:07:39.430
Uh, I also wanted to say, please smash like, and subscribe guys,

136
00:07:39.431 --> 00:07:43.450
because big things are coming and my retirement because I may be quitting,

137
00:07:43.570 --> 00:07:44.590
but it's just the beginning.
