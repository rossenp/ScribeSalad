1
00:00:00.060 --> 00:00:02.970
<v 0>You know, sometimes I look at the scammers these days and I wonder,</v>

2
00:00:02.971 --> 00:00:05.060
could we do better than this? I mean,

3
00:00:05.070 --> 00:00:08.610
is this the best the scammers have to offer right here?

4
00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:11.580
Six K K Andrew on Tik TOK, you know,

5
00:00:11.581 --> 00:00:14.820
waving 30 K around as if anyone's going to believe that he actually makes that,

6
00:00:15.210 --> 00:00:19.650
is this really what we have is this the best 2020 can muster?

7
00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:24.930
One year ago I dropped out of high school and to pursue is spelled it e-commerce

8
00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:27.450
and I think he needs to go back to high school. Oh,

9
00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:28.470
people said it was a bad decision,

10
00:00:28.471 --> 00:00:31.650
but I ended up making a hundred K in my first year. Okay.

11
00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:35.220
Will you think a hundred profit? No, a hundred K in sales,

12
00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:40.050
which means probably like 15 K in profit. So he's like,

13
00:00:40.051 --> 00:00:42.240
you guys think I'm an idiot for dropping out of high school,

14
00:00:42.241 --> 00:00:46.950
but I made 15 K last year. Uh, yeah, we think you're dumb.

15
00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:51.420
But my point is, this is the kind of stuff that it gets sent all the time.

16
00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:55.290
And I want to tell you, there was an age of scammer where people had class.

17
00:00:55.440 --> 00:00:57.390
I feel like it's like when the joker says, you know,

18
00:00:57.420 --> 00:00:59.520
we need a better class of criminal. This.

19
00:01:00.060 --> 00:01:01.350
<v 1>Deserves a better class.</v>

20
00:01:02.130 --> 00:01:04.500
<v 0>Hey, you guys are doing enough.</v>

21
00:01:04.560 --> 00:01:07.890
It's hard to even want to respond to this stuff. Honestly,

22
00:01:07.891 --> 00:01:10.020
I don't even know how to get out of bed in the morning when I look at this

23
00:01:10.021 --> 00:01:14.340
stuff. But let me tell you in the nineties, things were done very differently.

24
00:01:14.550 --> 00:01:18.870
Just compare and contrast this with this ladies and gentlemen,

25
00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:22.710
how to get a second paycheck, Hawaiian style. This is from the nineties,

26
00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:25.770
but it hits different. Trust me, watch and learn.

27
00:01:26.300 --> 00:01:29.360
<v 1>Hawaii. One of the most beautiful places on earth.</v>

28
00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:33.920
<v 0>Wow. The production value. The hired actresses in the back,</v>

29
00:01:33.921 --> 00:01:36.080
walking conveniently right next to this guy.

30
00:01:36.590 --> 00:01:40.460
<v 1>My name is Michael Flynn and I'm here on the beautiful Island of Mali.</v>

31
00:01:40.820 --> 00:01:44.870
I've got a question for you right now. How would you like to be in Hawaii?

32
00:01:45.440 --> 00:01:47.600
<v 0>I would, Michael. I would like that very much.</v>

33
00:01:48.110 --> 00:01:52.100
<v 1>Enjoying the good life and earning even more money than you do right now at</v>

34
00:01:52.101 --> 00:01:54.350
home. When you're slaving away at your regular job.

35
00:01:55.160 --> 00:01:57.470
<v 0>Michael, you've got my interest. Okay.</v>

36
00:01:57.471 --> 00:01:59.990
Because I am slaving away here making YouTube videos.

37
00:01:59.991 --> 00:02:03.320
The people at home don't know, this is the hardest job in the world. Very tough.

38
00:02:03.350 --> 00:02:06.650
So I'm ready, Michael. My body's ready for whatever you have for me.

39
00:02:06.830 --> 00:02:09.890
You've went to Hawaii for me. So I owe it to you to watch this.

40
00:02:10.350 --> 00:02:14.450
<v 1>In effect. I wouldn't. You like to get a second paycheck, Hawaiian style.</v>

41
00:02:14.630 --> 00:02:19.400
<v 0>It doesn't sound too bad. Oops. Already B roll on point.</v>

42
00:02:19.940 --> 00:02:23.240
Look guys remember, remember what you could be having.

43
00:02:23.270 --> 00:02:27.440
You could be having this guy or you have this.

44
00:02:27.560 --> 00:02:28.790
I think the answer's clear.

45
00:02:29.360 --> 00:02:33.710
<v 1>Just imagine Hawaii. The land of enchantment and magic.</v>

46
00:02:33.740 --> 00:02:36.620
The waterfalls, the land of volcano,

47
00:02:36.740 --> 00:02:41.660
the volcanoes luaus, and of hula dancers, tropical rain forest,

48
00:02:42.230 --> 00:02:44.450
and the most beautiful beaches in the world.

49
00:02:50.270 --> 00:02:53.990
<v 0>This is another reason the nineties infomercials just hit different.</v>

50
00:02:54.740 --> 00:02:58.730
You had Tom VU with his babes back in the day, calling them waterfalls,

51
00:02:58.760 --> 00:03:00.280
watching waterfall and the front.

52
00:03:00.580 --> 00:03:01.690
<v 1>The waterfall of the back,</v>

53
00:03:01.930 --> 00:03:04.720
the fall look like the leg waterfall inside the house.

54
00:03:04.750 --> 00:03:08.080
Now we got the beaches and the most beautiful beaches in the world.

55
00:03:08.340 --> 00:03:12.420
<v 0>Guys, the nineties infomercials next level. Okay.</v>

56
00:03:12.421 --> 00:03:15.450
They knew how to play. You subtly your psychology, right?

57
00:03:16.950 --> 00:03:20.580
<v 1>Hawaii, where you can be skin diving in the morning,</v>

58
00:03:21.030 --> 00:03:22.320
parasailing after lunch,

59
00:03:22.800 --> 00:03:26.370
shopping in mid-afternoon sipping a Mai Tai at sunset.

60
00:03:26.790 --> 00:03:30.530
And yet all the while you were making more money than you ever dreamed of.

61
00:03:31.020 --> 00:03:34.350
<v 0>See, look, we already know it's a scam, right?</v>

62
00:03:34.530 --> 00:03:38.520
But I'm there mentally. I'm in Hawaii. I've got the beaches.

63
00:03:38.700 --> 00:03:41.520
I've got the tropical rainforests. I've got it all.

64
00:03:41.580 --> 00:03:44.880
Even though I know it's a scam. That's what made the nineties different.

65
00:03:45.900 --> 00:03:47.310
<v 1>If you think that's impossible,</v>

66
00:03:47.370 --> 00:03:50.160
you're in for a surprise because in the next 30 minutes,

67
00:03:50.161 --> 00:03:52.350
you're going to meet a man who does all of that. Okay.

68
00:03:52.560 --> 00:03:56.280
<v 0>Let's get forward and meet the man. All right. This is the real man of the hour.</v>

69
00:03:56.310 --> 00:03:59.790
That's right. He has an intro, man. The Michael, he doesn't really matter.

70
00:04:00.060 --> 00:04:02.670
This is the guy that matters. This is Gary Cochran.

71
00:04:02.880 --> 00:04:04.440
<v 1>Than you ever dreamed possible.</v>

72
00:04:04.590 --> 00:04:08.400
And you can do it with a very simple business called direct marketing,

73
00:04:08.490 --> 00:04:12.990
$200 billion a year industry. That's a figure most of us can't comprehend.

74
00:04:13.200 --> 00:04:17.430
Can you even imagine what? $200 billion looks like George,

75
00:04:17.431 --> 00:04:18.300
go ahead and bring him in.

76
00:04:19.440 --> 00:04:20.910
<v 0>Are they bringing in $200 billion?</v>

77
00:04:20.940 --> 00:04:24.600
What's the wheel barrel about what are these men doing?

78
00:04:24.750 --> 00:04:28.620
<v 1>They seated in your seat. These guys do not have a great sense of humor. Now.</v>

79
00:04:30.780 --> 00:04:34.020
<v 0>Hey, Mr. Beast, calm down.</v>

80
00:04:34.680 --> 00:04:37.170
This is what I'm talking about. Listen,

81
00:04:37.171 --> 00:04:41.430
you can either have tiny Tim over here or you can have the Cochrane.

82
00:04:41.700 --> 00:04:44.190
Okay? Look at this guy. Whoo.

83
00:04:44.940 --> 00:04:49.800
That's a wheelbarrow full of cash. Actually. It's not one. It's not two, three.

84
00:04:50.280 --> 00:04:55.200
<v 1>Over 92 million of the four ordered by either mail or</v>

85
00:04:55.201 --> 00:04:59.940
phone six wheelbarrows of cash. That's how much I have right here on the stage.

86
00:05:00.090 --> 00:05:02.430
$380,000.

87
00:05:02.640 --> 00:05:06.870
That's what's earned in direct marketing every minute. Now,

88
00:05:06.900 --> 00:05:11.700
who would like some of this cash? If I guarantee you some,

89
00:05:11.701 --> 00:05:13.340
what would you do with it? What would you do with.

90
00:05:13.590 --> 00:05:15.510
<v 0>He's doing a genius move right now.</v>

91
00:05:15.690 --> 00:05:18.480
I'm going to tell you what it is in a second, but watch what he does.

92
00:05:18.720 --> 00:05:21.870
So first he primes people with the $20. I'll give you $20.

93
00:05:22.140 --> 00:05:22.973
What would you do with it?

94
00:05:23.700 --> 00:05:26.100
<v 1>You'd go out to dinner. Here's $20. Enjoy yourself,</v>

95
00:05:26.101 --> 00:05:28.500
but there's not enough to take two. What would you do with it?

96
00:05:29.280 --> 00:05:31.040
You have a need for a medical bill.

97
00:05:31.440 --> 00:05:33.240
<v 0>He's pulling the Allen before it was cool.</v>

98
00:05:33.241 --> 00:05:36.630
He gives it out to a bunch of people and then he takes it up and down.

99
00:05:36.750 --> 00:05:41.580
<v 1>Right? Yes. Right there. You'd go surfing $20. We'll rent you something.</v>

100
00:05:41.581 --> 00:05:45.600
All right. Now I'm not done. I still have right here.

101
00:05:45.720 --> 00:05:50.070
I have some hundred dollar bills who no, no, no.

102
00:05:50.130 --> 00:05:54.180
<v 0>This is where the great pitch starts. Guys. He upset a hundred dollars.</v>

103
00:05:54.181 --> 00:05:57.120
Now you're prime to think. He's going to give you a hundred dollars. Watch this.

104
00:05:57.200 --> 00:05:58.160
Oh wait, just a second.

105
00:05:58.160 --> 00:06:02.870
<v 1>I've got 100, 218, 1924, 25,</v>

106
00:06:03.050 --> 00:06:07.100
$100 bills. Who wants one of these? Guess what?

107
00:06:07.101 --> 00:06:11.660
Before I'm done today, I'm going to give 25 of you. One of these $100 bills.

108
00:06:12.130 --> 00:06:16.960
<v 0>Watch this guys. This is genius. This is innovation. Okay.</v>

109
00:06:17.350 --> 00:06:17.620
What?

110
00:06:17.620 --> 00:06:18.940
<v 1>And if you're watching at home,</v>

111
00:06:18.941 --> 00:06:21.120
I'm going to give you exactly the same opportunity.

112
00:06:21.130 --> 00:06:23.140
<v 0>The sleazebag scammer,</v>

113
00:06:23.370 --> 00:06:27.130
a hundred percent kind of brilliant. What he's about to do.

114
00:06:27.640 --> 00:06:28.780
<v 1>When you get that payment,</v>

115
00:06:28.930 --> 00:06:31.450
you are going to keep your portion of the payment and you will keep it.

116
00:06:31.630 --> 00:06:35.110
You will send the balance of the payment onto the producer of the product who

117
00:06:35.111 --> 00:06:37.600
will ship that product directly to the consumer.

118
00:06:37.750 --> 00:06:39.370
Do you understand what drop shipping is?

119
00:06:41.740 --> 00:06:46.060
<v 0>This is drop shipping. Oh, I finally understand this.</v>

120
00:06:46.300 --> 00:06:48.520
Guy's doing drop shipping scamming before it was cool.

121
00:06:48.610 --> 00:06:52.300
Right now everybody has a dropshipping course. This guy, Hey,

122
00:06:52.360 --> 00:06:54.640
back in the nineties, the innovation.

123
00:06:55.030 --> 00:06:58.720
Now you're asking yourself what about the $100 Steven? What happened?

124
00:06:58.810 --> 00:07:02.680
What happened to the $2,500 he was going to give away? Well, let's find out,

125
00:07:02.830 --> 00:07:04.570
cause this is, this is next level.

126
00:07:05.020 --> 00:07:09.670
<v 1>I still have right here, 25, $100 bills.</v>

127
00:07:09.760 --> 00:07:13.720
Who wants one of these? But let me ask you if I, people literally.

128
00:07:13.720 --> 00:07:16.090
<v 0>Sat through this whole presentation to get this money, gave.</v>

129
00:07:16.090 --> 00:07:20.260
<v 1>You one who would use it to invest in themselves and get this course of</v>

130
00:07:20.261 --> 00:07:22.930
materials and get started today. Could I see your hands?

131
00:07:23.110 --> 00:07:24.640
That's exactly what I'm going to do.

132
00:07:24.641 --> 00:07:28.840
You come with me and I will pay the first hundred dollars of the cost of your

133
00:07:28.841 --> 00:07:30.040
program. Wait.

134
00:07:30.250 --> 00:07:32.830
<v 0>The minute you're not giving the buddy,</v>

135
00:07:33.850 --> 00:07:38.320
you said you're giving people money, but only if they pay you for your course,

136
00:07:38.530 --> 00:07:42.970
which is 250 bucks. So, so you're just doing a sale.

137
00:07:43.510 --> 00:07:45.340
But think about that. He had him wait,

138
00:07:45.341 --> 00:07:47.530
the entire time everyone's paying attention.

139
00:07:47.560 --> 00:07:48.850
They think there's going to be a quiz at the end.

140
00:07:48.851 --> 00:07:50.740
They think they're going to get a hundred free bucks. No,

141
00:07:50.741 --> 00:07:53.200
you have to pay 250 bucks to get a hundred bucks.

142
00:07:53.980 --> 00:07:58.510
<v 1>So that your entire cost is only $149.</v>

143
00:07:58.930 --> 00:08:01.450
Brian that's for this one right here. That's for this one right here.

144
00:08:01.810 --> 00:08:03.430
And for those of you at home,

145
00:08:03.460 --> 00:08:06.010
you do not have an opportunity to be at the seminar,

146
00:08:06.160 --> 00:08:08.410
but I will do exactly the same thing for you.

147
00:08:08.620 --> 00:08:11.860
I will pay the first a hundred dollars of the cost of this program.

148
00:08:12.280 --> 00:08:16.210
<v 0>You know, guys, I literally never fall for this stuff, but a hundred dollars.</v>

149
00:08:16.420 --> 00:08:18.160
<v 2>Please stay on the line to continue. I.</v>

150
00:08:18.160 --> 00:08:21.070
<v 0>Honestly thought that number would be disconnected for sure.</v>

151
00:08:22.210 --> 00:08:26.140
<v 2>Your call is important to us. Please hold for the next available specialist.</v>

152
00:08:26.950 --> 00:08:28.570
<v 0>By the way, while we're waiting.</v>

153
00:08:28.660 --> 00:08:32.560
This is one of the things I saw in the comment section of this video.

154
00:08:33.250 --> 00:08:37.520
Hilariously four months ago in a video with 1900 people, I'm one of the 1900.

155
00:08:38.320 --> 00:08:39.940
<v 2>Due to overwhelming response.</v>

156
00:08:39.970 --> 00:08:42.580
All of our representatives are assisting other callers.

157
00:08:42.910 --> 00:08:45.820
Please continue to hold for the next available representative.

158
00:08:46.750 --> 00:08:51.280
<v 0>Let me respond to people who are still watching Gary Cochran. Oh yeah.</v>

159
00:08:51.281 --> 00:08:55.650
It's a big, big slam. A jam ahead, boys. You know the nineties infomercials,

160
00:08:55.651 --> 00:08:59.940
they're still crushing sales calls. Okay. I'm.

161
00:09:00.300 --> 00:09:01.133
Gary. Now.

162
00:09:01.760 --> 00:09:03.380
<v 2>Due to overwhelming response,</v>

163
00:09:03.410 --> 00:09:05.990
all of our representatives are assisting other callers.

164
00:09:06.320 --> 00:09:09.350
Please continue to hold for the next available representative.

165
00:09:11.780 --> 00:09:15.740
<v 0>I'm sorry. I'm sorry, Gary. I tried, but interesting enough, the seminar,</v>

166
00:09:15.741 --> 00:09:20.180
which is still apparently selling tons of copies. Didn't last very long.

167
00:09:20.480 --> 00:09:21.650
In 1991,

168
00:09:21.680 --> 00:09:26.480
they got accused of operating a scam for selling their instructive video tapes

169
00:09:26.690 --> 00:09:29.750
because they didn't actually ship out the products.

170
00:09:29.810 --> 00:09:34.220
See Gary Cochran owned this company called American business seminars and they

171
00:09:34.221 --> 00:09:38.180
raised $400,000 by accepting money for these tapes.

172
00:09:38.600 --> 00:09:42.350
But they failed to deliver the tapes and they didn't provide refunds.

173
00:09:42.500 --> 00:09:44.000
So then what does Gary do?

174
00:09:44.030 --> 00:09:47.390
Gary's at a pinch while he decides to file for bankruptcy.

175
00:09:47.660 --> 00:09:51.170
Now the funny thing is I tried to look up more about Gary Cochran.

176
00:09:51.171 --> 00:09:52.670
There isn't much available,

177
00:09:52.700 --> 00:09:55.670
but I did find you guys cause I want to close the story up.

178
00:09:55.700 --> 00:09:58.880
I wanted to find you the truth about this nineties,

179
00:09:58.910 --> 00:10:03.020
infomercial pioneer. I wanted to know what happened to him, right?

180
00:10:03.290 --> 00:10:05.210
So I found an old newspaper clipping.

181
00:10:05.240 --> 00:10:08.360
This is literally from 1991.

182
00:10:08.930 --> 00:10:12.650
And basically they repeat the fact that he's filing chapter 11 bankruptcy.

183
00:10:12.651 --> 00:10:17.030
So he looks like his company was failing at the same time in an affidavit filed

184
00:10:17.060 --> 00:10:20.870
October 25th. And this, this paper came out on November 2nd.

185
00:10:21.230 --> 00:10:26.000
It says that Cochran was receiving a salary of $700,000 per month.

186
00:10:26.030 --> 00:10:30.230
While his wife made a hundred thousand dollars a month classic pay gap,

187
00:10:30.231 --> 00:10:33.860
ladies and gentlemen, but it looks like the end of Gary Cochran. Wasn't pretty,

188
00:10:34.100 --> 00:10:37.040
I don't know, honestly, you can't find much online about him,

189
00:10:37.430 --> 00:10:41.120
but I thought this is an interesting look at the scammers of old.

190
00:10:41.240 --> 00:10:45.020
We think of this as a new thing on the internet, but the truth is scams.

191
00:10:45.021 --> 00:10:47.660
Like this are as old as time, right? They were done in the nineties.

192
00:10:47.780 --> 00:10:51.560
They were done. Even before that with chain letters, guys, this is nothing new,

193
00:10:51.800 --> 00:10:55.460
but you got to educate yourself. You got to see through this stuff. But frankly,

194
00:10:55.461 --> 00:10:59.000
I really do think it's easier than ever because people like this, uh,

195
00:11:00.170 --> 00:11:02.180
it's disappointing. They don't have the class.

196
00:11:02.210 --> 00:11:06.620
They don't have the production value of the stuff back in the day. And um,

197
00:11:06.680 --> 00:11:10.130
honestly I think it's an opportunity for people now because I think it's easier

198
00:11:10.131 --> 00:11:14.000
than ever to see through these guys because they don't have the showmanship,

199
00:11:14.240 --> 00:11:17.660
the presentation skills back in the day. Because like, look, dude,

200
00:11:17.690 --> 00:11:20.180
you look at the stuff back in the day. You almost want to buy it.

201
00:11:20.360 --> 00:11:22.670
You almost want to go get a wheelbarrow of cash yourself.

202
00:11:22.730 --> 00:11:25.220
But nowadays you have people like this and it's like, Oh yeah,

203
00:11:25.221 --> 00:11:29.000
I know this guy's scamming me. Of course. Anyway, it's guys,

204
00:11:29.210 --> 00:11:32.060
that's the video. I hope you enjoyed a look back.

00:11:32.090 --> 00:11:33.230
