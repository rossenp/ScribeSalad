1
00:00:00.150 --> 00:00:04.080
<v 0>What up, welcome to the trillionaire club guys,</v>

2
00:00:04.230 --> 00:00:06.600
big deal here in the tree, in our club.

3
00:00:06.690 --> 00:00:09.720
Not only are you richer than the richest man in the world,

4
00:00:11.100 --> 00:00:15.990
but also you can learn about the system that helped this man obtain his Lambo in

5
00:00:15.991 --> 00:00:20.610
90 days. Yes, that's right. Uh, pretty incredible stuff.

6
00:00:20.700 --> 00:00:21.600
But before we get into that,

7
00:00:21.601 --> 00:00:25.890
we're going to do something that I want to call ethics tips.

8
00:00:26.350 --> 00:00:30.810
This is basically a lot of comments since the golden rule is don't be a piece

9
00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:34.770
of. Basically. Don't lie to people,

10
00:00:35.310 --> 00:00:35.851
ladies and gentlemen.

11
00:00:35.851 --> 00:00:40.440
So many of you are out there just doing the most ridiculous things to try to get

12
00:00:40.441 --> 00:00:45.390
clicks. You think that clicks are everything and are worth selling out for,

13
00:00:45.391 --> 00:00:48.780
or compromising your image. And it's not.

14
00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:51.180
Let me show you an example of what I mean today.

15
00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:54.930
This is what I like to call the tick talk lie.

16
00:00:58.880 --> 00:01:00.290
I really don't want to play too much of this. Otherwise,

17
00:01:00.291 --> 00:01:04.220
we're going to get demonetized here, but it says a mute it, here we go.

18
00:01:06.230 --> 00:01:06.530
<v 1>When.</v>

19
00:01:06.530 --> 00:01:10.250
<v 0>Our clients make high ticket sales without a webinar or funnel,</v>

20
00:01:10.251 --> 00:01:13.820
and you see this lady freaking out and Oh my gosh, look at them.

21
00:01:13.910 --> 00:01:16.970
They're so excited because they're getting high ticket sales without a webinar

22
00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:20.360
or funnel. Now somebody sent me this and they pointed out, look,

23
00:01:20.361 --> 00:01:22.760
you have the coach on the left-hand side, smiling ride.

24
00:01:22.761 --> 00:01:25.070
You have the family and the right-hand side, his life has been changed,

25
00:01:26.030 --> 00:01:30.950
but here's the deal. It's faith. That's right guys.

26
00:01:30.980 --> 00:01:33.530
Because if someone pointed out to me, someone else was doing this too.

27
00:01:33.650 --> 00:01:35.390
And both of these people are lying about it.

28
00:01:37.610 --> 00:01:42.350
This is the same exact video, Friday, Friday,

29
00:01:43.230 --> 00:01:45.890
man. So much money. Come join my team, right?

30
00:01:45.891 --> 00:01:50.780
You'll be shouting like this family right here. You'll be so excited.

31
00:01:50.930 --> 00:01:51.770
But here's the deal.

32
00:01:52.430 --> 00:01:56.150
This is not about anyone taking a guru's course.

33
00:01:56.450 --> 00:01:59.570
This is all stolen from a tick-tock.

34
00:01:59.750 --> 00:02:01.820
It says posting because I love these videos.

35
00:02:01.821 --> 00:02:05.870
And this is the happiest I've been in a while for getting into my dream school.

36
00:02:06.020 --> 00:02:08.990
This is this lady getting into her dream school.

37
00:02:09.080 --> 00:02:11.960
And it's now being used as a reaction for marketers.

38
00:02:11.961 --> 00:02:15.200
Pretending like it's their course that got them to act like this. I mean,

39
00:02:15.201 --> 00:02:17.360
watch again, guys, what would you think if you saw this dude?

40
00:02:20.060 --> 00:02:20.893
<v 1>Oh yeah.</v>

41
00:02:21.250 --> 00:02:26.000
<v 0>Ah, I'm so happy for them. Except this isn't real. This is a lie.</v>

42
00:02:26.060 --> 00:02:30.770
It's a lie. Gotcha. Look anything, dude.

43
00:02:30.771 --> 00:02:35.270
These people will do anything for the sale. It's unbelievable. Don't do this.

44
00:02:35.360 --> 00:02:37.250
Okay. This is bad, bad.

45
00:02:38.120 --> 00:02:40.970
And then what's funny is I saw this guy who video,

46
00:02:40.971 --> 00:02:45.950
we just watched talking about, Oh, how do you think I get so many testimonials?

47
00:02:46.370 --> 00:02:46.880
Have you ever had.

48
00:02:46.880 --> 00:02:51.230
<v 2>I had an issue getting testimonials from your clients? If so,</v>

49
00:02:51.231 --> 00:02:54.110
I want you to stay tuned in this field because I'm going to show you exactly how

50
00:02:54.111 --> 00:02:56.240
I get so many testimonials.

51
00:02:56.630 --> 00:02:58.640
<v 0>So don't worry, Tanner.</v>

52
00:02:58.700 --> 00:03:02.470
Chidester we know how you get so many testimonials.

53
00:03:02.470 --> 00:03:04.720
<v 1>Buddy. Yeah. You troll.</v>

54
00:03:04.720 --> 00:03:07.210
<v 0>Over to that. A tick tock page.</v>

55
00:03:08.200 --> 00:03:12.490
And you just go ahead and throw it a little reaction right here.

56
00:03:12.491 --> 00:03:13.810
Let's do one right now.

57
00:03:23.070 --> 00:03:23.430
<v 1>[Inaudible].</v>

58
00:03:23.430 --> 00:03:25.980
<v 0>But anyway guys, that's the ethics tip of the day.</v>

59
00:03:26.280 --> 00:03:29.820
Don't take reactions and pretend that they're your customers.

60
00:03:30.480 --> 00:03:33.030
How this, this honestly, isn't that hard,

61
00:03:33.480 --> 00:03:38.370
but this ethics tip has been brought to you by our old friends over at

62
00:03:38.371 --> 00:03:41.460
info Wars. You guys know I'm a media buyer for Alex. Uh,

63
00:03:41.550 --> 00:03:44.070
obviously he wants to support the show, Alex,

64
00:03:44.071 --> 00:03:47.490
thanks for your support of the show. I didn't even know you watched, uh,

65
00:03:47.550 --> 00:03:51.540
you know, you have a message for these gurus. You're you're upset about it.

66
00:03:51.780 --> 00:03:52.770
What do you have to say to them?

67
00:03:53.610 --> 00:03:55.860
<v 1>Lam heads with you. I'm here to take you down.</v>

68
00:03:56.370 --> 00:04:00.540
My destruction is the seeds of your shore destruction fools.

69
00:04:00.960 --> 00:04:02.670
<v 0>Thank you, Alex. As always,</v>

70
00:04:02.671 --> 00:04:06.690
this message has been brought to you by crippling debt for my expensive $10

71
00:04:06.690 --> 00:04:10.500
million studio. Guys, you may have noticed the production value is sick lately.

72
00:04:11.610 --> 00:04:12.150
Um,

73
00:04:12.150 --> 00:04:16.050
I seem to be in these incredible places that I almost couldn't be physically.

74
00:04:16.440 --> 00:04:20.790
And you wonder how do you put up such a gigantic studio? Well, guys, I'm in,

75
00:04:20.820 --> 00:04:21.690
you should know.

76
00:04:23.700 --> 00:04:27.540
I built a gigantic warehouse and all of these sets are physically built.

77
00:04:27.541 --> 00:04:31.110
I'm physically in these areas and that's just what it is.

78
00:04:31.560 --> 00:04:36.270
And we have to pay for it. Somehow guys, money is a fuel unit. Don't forget.

79
00:04:36.330 --> 00:04:37.320
You must have enough fuel.

80
00:04:37.950 --> 00:04:40.350
<v 1>To live out your new Lamborghini here in the Hollywood Hills.</v>

81
00:04:40.800 --> 00:04:42.540
<v 0>But anyway, guys, let's get back to it. Okay?</v>

82
00:04:42.541 --> 00:04:44.820
You want to know you're here for the trillionaire club.

83
00:04:44.850 --> 00:04:49.680
You want to know how do I get a Lambo in 90 days? Well,

84
00:04:50.400 --> 00:04:54.690
our boy, the Ray cart here is here to tell you.

85
00:04:55.110 --> 00:04:58.230
Now the first thing to know is he's one of these lifestyle gurus. Now,

86
00:04:58.231 --> 00:04:59.220
what do I mean by that?

87
00:05:00.030 --> 00:05:03.480
I mean that he doesn't really talk about how to make money.

88
00:05:03.481 --> 00:05:07.770
He more just shows off his lifestyle and then is always saying like, Oh,

89
00:05:07.830 --> 00:05:11.640
hit me up. If you want to know more like, like pictures like this, okay?

90
00:05:12.530 --> 00:05:16.980
Mind the business that pays you. Okay. I don't, what is that? Huh?

91
00:05:17.070 --> 00:05:20.640
Leverage the system that pays you. Ooh, we're getting original now.

92
00:05:20.700 --> 00:05:24.180
But ultimately all this money has to come from somewhere after all.

93
00:05:24.270 --> 00:05:27.960
He says that he didn't start with a silver spoon in his mouth. No,

94
00:05:27.961 --> 00:05:32.370
he was broke before he learned how to make this money.

95
00:05:32.520 --> 00:05:35.910
Here we go from being 10 K in debt to six, figure income,

96
00:05:36.210 --> 00:05:38.340
want to find out how send us a DM.

97
00:05:41.790 --> 00:05:42.330
<v 1>[Inaudible].</v>

98
00:05:42.330 --> 00:05:45.900
<v 0>Nothing like a money counter to really get us interested. But my point is,</v>

99
00:05:45.930 --> 00:05:49.560
you really don't know what this guy's into until you kind of dig a little bit

100
00:05:49.561 --> 00:05:52.410
more in, you know, all of these lifestyle guys are like that. You're like,

101
00:05:52.411 --> 00:05:56.100
what do you do besides take pictures? Like, how do you make money?

102
00:05:56.610 --> 00:05:59.330
It's there. You're saying you're so successful.

103
00:05:59.331 --> 00:06:01.970
You're getting a Lambo in 90 days. How.

104
00:06:03.020 --> 00:06:07.210
<v 3>Is Ray Milano? I'm on 26 year old Forex trader and I've helped.</v>

105
00:06:07.240 --> 00:06:09.760
Thousands of people become successful in Forex trading.

106
00:06:10.660 --> 00:06:12.460
<v 0>Come on, dude.</v>

107
00:06:14.320 --> 00:06:16.000
<v 3>Today I checked off another dream of.</v>

108
00:06:16.210 --> 00:06:17.043
<v 0>Mine.</v>

109
00:06:20.890 --> 00:06:22.030
I swear, dude,

110
00:06:22.270 --> 00:06:27.190
this is just bait for the 18 year olds out there who want to

111
00:06:27.191 --> 00:06:31.360
get rich quick. They're watching this stuff like, Oh my gosh,

112
00:06:31.450 --> 00:06:35.740
I don't need to go to college. I don't need to get a job.

113
00:06:35.950 --> 00:06:40.510
I'm going to quit my whole career and go join Ray.

114
00:06:40.511 --> 00:06:44.230
Cardiay cardiac care. How do you say it? I don't know.

115
00:06:44.830 --> 00:06:48.700
And it's disgusting, but it's also hilarious. Like you're following this.

116
00:06:49.480 --> 00:06:54.280
What is he actually selling you? Right? I can't, I still don't know.

117
00:06:54.520 --> 00:06:58.150
What is he selling education. Okay. What does that mean? What did,

118
00:06:58.180 --> 00:07:01.420
how did he learn to trade Forex? Okay.

119
00:07:01.421 --> 00:07:03.790
So apparently a lot of this is linked to this thing.

120
00:07:03.791 --> 00:07:06.340
He does called sky net legacy.

121
00:07:07.000 --> 00:07:11.800
Now it says new and improved artificial intelligence trading. So I was like,

122
00:07:11.830 --> 00:07:15.700
okay, that's what he does. He's an artificial intelligence trader,

123
00:07:15.701 --> 00:07:18.280
which honestly sounds cooler than it actually is. You know,

124
00:07:18.281 --> 00:07:20.560
there's a lot of these trading bots that make nothing.

125
00:07:21.250 --> 00:07:24.130
But I was interested in what actually this is.

126
00:07:24.131 --> 00:07:28.480
So I went to the page, you get some generic thing.

127
00:07:28.500 --> 00:07:32.080
So I got the webinar, whatever I went to the webinar link.

128
00:07:32.500 --> 00:07:36.760
Now this is where I'm doing the due diligence for you guys to have you actually

129
00:07:36.790 --> 00:07:38.470
go and sign up for the webinar.

130
00:07:38.500 --> 00:07:43.480
This is what you get to an unlisted YouTube video where it's selling you not

131
00:07:43.481 --> 00:07:44.710
on Skynet legacy.

132
00:07:44.711 --> 00:07:47.290
I thought this guy had created his own artificial intelligence.

133
00:07:47.291 --> 00:07:50.470
That's what he makes it sound like. And his advertising instead,

134
00:07:50.471 --> 00:07:52.840
he's pitching something called a vorea prime.

135
00:07:53.080 --> 00:07:56.560
Now I'm not going to bore you with all of this. But basically he goes, Oh yeah,

136
00:07:56.561 --> 00:07:57.790
we'll meet the team. You know,

137
00:07:57.791 --> 00:08:01.480
it's this amazing team that built this amazing trading bot that you can use to

138
00:08:01.481 --> 00:08:05.110
make money. No questions asked. This is what this guy is selling you.

139
00:08:05.200 --> 00:08:09.430
He's saying you can be like me. You can be rich. If you join a vorea prime,

140
00:08:09.730 --> 00:08:13.990
they sell an Alexander package and an era's package. There are two trading bots,

141
00:08:13.991 --> 00:08:18.310
I guess they give you alerts. One is two 67 now one 89 a month.

142
00:08:18.370 --> 00:08:22.960
And the other is $110 a month. So you're thinking,

143
00:08:23.350 --> 00:08:26.950
Oh, so it's a product.

144
00:08:26.951 --> 00:08:30.940
That's how people are making money or they're making money by trading. No,

145
00:08:30.970 --> 00:08:35.080
also not. That's not how they make their money. This is, this is actually,

146
00:08:35.560 --> 00:08:36.090
and it takes,

147
00:08:36.090 --> 00:08:40.810
it took me forever to realize this it's just a multi-level marketing company.

148
00:08:41.080 --> 00:08:45.100
It's all a front, it's a product. That's right at the end of the day,

149
00:08:45.640 --> 00:08:49.870
after all this talk about wealth, you know, living the lifestyle,

150
00:08:50.500 --> 00:08:52.840
it turns out that this is a,

151
00:08:52.841 --> 00:08:56.550
an MLM and it's not even first version of this MLM.

152
00:08:56.610 --> 00:08:59.610
It started as silver start live.

153
00:08:59.640 --> 00:09:02.910
I don't know if you guys can see that silver star live right here,

154
00:09:03.150 --> 00:09:07.050
which apparently ended in a $75,000 fraud settlement.

155
00:09:07.500 --> 00:09:11.970
Then they tried rebooting it as EA economy that collapsed.

156
00:09:12.240 --> 00:09:15.120
Now they're rebooting it again under this guy. Now,

157
00:09:15.121 --> 00:09:16.530
does that guy look familiar to you?

158
00:09:16.560 --> 00:09:20.550
He should because that's this man right here, Sal Lettow.

159
00:09:24.380 --> 00:09:28.010
He's one of the guys that marketed the one coin Ponzi scheme.

160
00:09:28.310 --> 00:09:32.990
And now he's trying to revamp this failed trading bot as

161
00:09:33.830 --> 00:09:37.610
Avorio prime. This is all according to behind MLM,

162
00:09:37.670 --> 00:09:39.680
which I find to be a pretty reputable source.

163
00:09:40.010 --> 00:09:43.190
When it comes to investigating these types of opportunities. Now,

164
00:09:43.191 --> 00:09:46.700
what does this all mean? Well, it means basis is safe. I mean,

165
00:09:46.701 --> 00:09:51.470
I really thought when I saw the trillionaire club up here that bayzos has been

166
00:09:51.471 --> 00:09:53.600
cracked. I mean, as you know, he's not a trillionaire yet.

167
00:09:53.601 --> 00:09:56.920
He's probably watched this guy like, Hey, do I have to take this guy out?

168
00:09:56.940 --> 00:10:01.550
I have to drone strike him. He's is he ahead of me in the game? I'll know this.

169
00:10:01.850 --> 00:10:06.440
Guy's another poser trying to sell you with jealousy with, uh,

170
00:10:06.500 --> 00:10:10.550
envy. He's trying to sell you a product and make himself rich.

171
00:10:10.580 --> 00:10:14.720
And he's trying to sell you. Multi-level marketing guys. What are we in 2012,

172
00:10:14.721 --> 00:10:19.280
dude, I thought this Avon Amway stuff was long dead.

173
00:10:19.281 --> 00:10:23.510
Apparently it's all moved over to us. Stuff like Forex, stuff like that.

174
00:10:23.511 --> 00:10:25.520
Don't bother with this stuff, guys.

175
00:10:25.521 --> 00:10:29.150
You should know by now you should know better. We here in the cup,

176
00:10:29.330 --> 00:10:31.130
these L army were advanced in the game.

177
00:10:31.880 --> 00:10:35.300
So if you ever see one of your friends getting into this stuff, Hey, stop them.

178
00:10:36.710 --> 00:10:41.390
You got to tell them, look, friends. Don't let friends get in scams. That's it.

179
00:10:41.420 --> 00:10:45.650
By the way, also, let me just say as an aside, if you can avoid,

180
00:10:45.651 --> 00:10:47.180
I know a lot of people are super into cars,

181
00:10:47.600 --> 00:10:52.220
but the more you can avoid getting trapped by

182
00:10:52.221 --> 00:10:54.470
these and they are a trap, uh,

183
00:10:55.220 --> 00:10:59.510
kind of like luxury desires, the less you have to work. I mean,

184
00:10:59.511 --> 00:11:02.210
all these people, they always talk about like living a laptop lifestyle,

185
00:11:02.390 --> 00:11:02.601
you know,

186
00:11:02.601 --> 00:11:06.590
the best way to live a laptop lifestyle and to not have to work as much lower

187
00:11:06.591 --> 00:11:11.030
your expectations. If you want to Lambo, Hey, guess what?

188
00:11:11.031 --> 00:11:14.990
You're going to be working hard. I'm work at busting it all the time.

189
00:11:14.991 --> 00:11:18.470
Just so you can have other dudes can look at you like nice car, bro.

190
00:11:18.740 --> 00:11:21.980
But instead, if you can just be content, you know, with the Honda civic.

191
00:11:22.640 --> 00:11:27.290
But instead that sounds so lame, but you guys know what I mean. If you,

192
00:11:27.291 --> 00:11:30.230
if you don't have to have all that stuff, guess what?

193
00:11:30.530 --> 00:11:33.650
You don't need to work as hard because you don't have these like crazy

194
00:11:33.651 --> 00:11:34.580
expectations for life.

195
00:11:34.880 --> 00:11:38.810
That's why I think these things are doubly stupid because on the one hand it

196
00:11:38.811 --> 00:11:41.810
promotes like this like, Oh dude, Hey bro, just.

197
00:11:41.840 --> 00:11:44.060
<v 5>Gab cash and stacks. And then live.</v>

198
00:11:44.060 --> 00:11:47.360
<v 0>This luxury lifestyle. And you have kids like idolizing this stuff,</v>

199
00:11:47.361 --> 00:11:50.060
which is so stupid. But then at the same time,

200
00:11:50.061 --> 00:11:53.710
they don't make the money that they're saying you need to make to the lifestyle.

201
00:11:53.800 --> 00:11:57.490
So they're promoting this super expensive lifestyle and also not delivering.

202
00:11:57.790 --> 00:12:00.850
Sorry to get all philosophical with you boys. That's basically it.

203
00:12:00.880 --> 00:12:01.713
Thanks for watching.

204
00:12:02.610 --> 00:12:06.630
<v 1>Don't forget to smash like and subscribe. Thank you.</v>

205
