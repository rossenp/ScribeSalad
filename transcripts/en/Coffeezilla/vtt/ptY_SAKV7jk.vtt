1
00:00:00.090 --> 00:00:04.680
<v 0>I challenged a thousand people to Photoshop this image,</v>

2
00:00:05.670 --> 00:00:10.080
an idea that's completely original. And I didn't steal from small time streamer,

3
00:00:10.110 --> 00:00:14.940
Ludwig. Uh, so don't even look into that. Those are fake allegations,

4
00:00:14.941 --> 00:00:16.650
you know, all that kind of stuff. Hold on, let me, sorry.

5
00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:21.000
Let me get on y'all's level. Okay. Sorry. Tall guy problems over here. Uh,

6
00:00:21.030 --> 00:00:23.220

00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:30.390

9
00:00:30.391 --> 00:00:35.000
it's a small club of privileged people right now who Photoshop this image.

10
00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:36.680
So we're going to see what you guys yeah,

I will also be selecting my personal favorite to also receive platinum. Okay.

14
00:00:49.070 --> 00:00:50.630
If it's terrible, if it's good, whatever,

15
00:00:50.631 --> 00:00:53.840
anything that makes me laugh and then finally stayed to the end because I'm

16
00:00:53.841 --> 00:00:56.450
going to be announcing next week's challenge.

17
00:00:56.630 --> 00:00:58.850
So if you want to win imaginary internet points,

18
00:00:58.851 --> 00:01:00.530
that don't matter to anyone else,

19
00:01:00.770 --> 00:01:03.710
but about a thousand people who know this thing exists, Hey,

20
00:01:04.790 --> 00:01:08.960
you've come to the right place. Love go to the subreddit guys. Uh, honestly,

21
00:01:08.961 --> 00:01:11.630
we're going pretty fast. A thousand members already.

22
00:01:11.631 --> 00:01:15.290
We need to bump those numbers up 10,000 would be nice. Uh, but you know,

23
00:01:15.291 --> 00:01:19.070
we're growing. We just started last week. Okay. Give me cut. Cut me some Slack.

24
00:01:19.460 --> 00:01:22.100
So let's get into it. First meeting.

25
00:01:26.630 --> 00:01:27.463
<v 1>Yes.</v>

26
00:01:27.860 --> 00:01:32.540
<v 0>Coffee Zilla. After missing an upload. Hey man, no, this is not gonna happen,</v>

27
00:01:32.570 --> 00:01:35.990
guys. This is never going to happen. I honestly,

28
00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:40.910
I saw always Mark. I don't know if you guys saw this guy, a friend of mine.

29
00:01:41.030 --> 00:01:44.330
He recently shaved his head and it's not a good luck.

30
00:01:44.540 --> 00:01:48.770
I really joined his stream and I realized immediately this cannot happen to me.

31
00:01:48.890 --> 00:01:51.230
So we are not going to be missing an upload daily,

32
00:01:51.710 --> 00:01:54.740
YouTube all the way through January, maybe February. We'll see,

33
00:01:55.640 --> 00:01:59.120
but not going to happen. So I gave that gold. Yes. Cause I'm a,

34
00:01:59.160 --> 00:02:02.630
I'm a giving man next meme. By the way,

35
00:02:02.631 --> 00:02:04.880
some of these means if it doesn't have the Photoshop damage in it,

36
00:02:04.910 --> 00:02:07.070
it's technically not up for competition.

37
00:02:07.310 --> 00:02:10.250
But I thought we just look at the memes of the subreddit anyways. Okay.

38
00:02:10.640 --> 00:02:11.570
The story I tell.

39
00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:14.780
<v 1>What actually happened.</v>

40
00:02:17.940 --> 00:02:20.990
<v 0>Pina is like stabbing a Teddy bear and he's on Joe Rogan.</v>

41
00:02:20.991 --> 00:02:22.430
The next day being like Joe,

42
00:02:22.431 --> 00:02:26.480
it was eight feet tall and it was about to kill me until I got it.

43
00:02:27.860 --> 00:02:32.240
Okay. I guess that's a chuckle I'll up vote that I not, you know,

44
00:02:33.260 --> 00:02:35.840
a lot of memes that are not part of the competition.

45
00:02:36.200 --> 00:02:38.540
This is the first thing actually. I learned about my audience.

46
00:02:38.570 --> 00:02:39.403
Y'all don't listen.

47
00:02:39.680 --> 00:02:44.180
That's number one is that these are irrelevant beams.

48
00:02:44.690 --> 00:02:47.960
I'm pretty good. Honestly spoken like a true laptop, lifestyle millionaire.

49
00:02:48.200 --> 00:02:52.670
A 30 year Harvard education. This is worthless.

50
00:02:52.940 --> 00:02:53.773
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

51
00:02:56.180 --> 00:02:57.800
<v 0>That's what Caleb Maddix believes.</v>

52
00:02:58.030 --> 00:03:00.820
So what a lot of these guys believe they're like 30 years at Harvard.

53
00:03:01.120 --> 00:03:05.560
It's a waste of time. It's why would you even do that? I mean,

54
00:03:05.561 --> 00:03:08.830
it reminds me of this stuff, dude. It's like, it's not just Kayla Maddox.

55
00:03:08.831 --> 00:03:10.330
Who's pushing this whack idea.

56
00:03:10.530 --> 00:03:15.030
<v 1>Obsolete ideal is go to school, get a job, work hard, save money.</v>

57
00:03:18.120 --> 00:03:19.350
Robert Kiyosaki.

58
00:03:20.280 --> 00:03:22.410
<v 0>Terrible idea. Don't listen to that guy.</v>

59
00:03:22.680 --> 00:03:27.060
The most absolute idea is to get a job guys, Hey, you don't need a job.

60
00:03:27.900 --> 00:03:30.390
You can chill gold. And so get rigid,

61
00:03:30.391 --> 00:03:33.900
vice like Robert Kiyosaki guys sell for MLMs.

62
00:03:34.470 --> 00:03:39.180
Do that guys try that on for size, greatest opportunity of our era. So, uh,

63
00:03:39.240 --> 00:03:44.160
gave that gold and I'll go ahead and give that enough Toke. Alright, next meme.

64
00:03:45.540 --> 00:03:49.830
Business. Okay. Again, not relevant to the competition, but okay. That's fine.

65
00:03:49.980 --> 00:03:50.731
Business gurus.

66
00:03:50.731 --> 00:03:55.500
Be like having a stable nine to five job that Robert Kiyosaki hustling

67
00:03:55.530 --> 00:03:59.400
24 seven and not actually making money. I'll take it

68
00:04:01.410 --> 00:04:05.460
all up about it. Give it gold. Uh, see I'm a generous, you know,

69
00:04:05.920 --> 00:04:09.750
dictator over here in the coffees, Dilla, Gigi sobriety, you got to join guys.

70
00:04:10.110 --> 00:04:13.770
Cause I'm very nice to people. Next meme, top tips,

71
00:04:13.830 --> 00:04:18.540
not relevant in many of the youngsters asked me I became so successful.

72
00:04:18.541 --> 00:04:22.620
So here are my top tips. Buy a big house to impress investment bankers.

73
00:04:22.950 --> 00:04:24.510
<v 1>But for investment bankers.</v>

74
00:04:24.780 --> 00:04:29.010
<v 0>Get investment bankers drunk, learn insight, information off junk bankers.</v>

75
00:04:29.760 --> 00:04:33.780
Trade-off insight information. Very simple. Good, good advice.

76
00:04:33.840 --> 00:04:36.990
Actually not the first time we've had pretty good advice on this.

77
00:04:37.320 --> 00:04:40.320
Separate it so far, the real pandemic at home.

78
00:04:42.720 --> 00:04:47.190
Nice. Okay. You get gold for that. Me mom, can I get a Harvard education?

79
00:04:47.580 --> 00:04:51.750
Mom, you can have a Harvard education at home. The Harvard education at home.

80
00:04:56.970 --> 00:04:59.190
It's kind of true. Isn't it, man? Uh,

81
00:04:59.220 --> 00:05:02.400
this is the new they're pitching themselves. Harvard educated.

82
00:05:02.401 --> 00:05:05.460
It's like these guys are snake oil salesman. This is not even close.

83
00:05:05.850 --> 00:05:10.710
It's not even close. This is like, how Ameesha is. He went to Harvard, X,

84
00:05:10.890 --> 00:05:14.910
Harvard, X. Not the same thing guys.

85
00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:18.780
Not the same long time. No. See friend. I haven't seen in years.

86
00:05:19.290 --> 00:05:23.310
MI pyramid scheme. Yeah.

87
00:05:24.210 --> 00:05:25.380
This kind of hits close to home.

88
00:05:25.560 --> 00:05:28.590
But if you ever get a text or Facebook messenger,

89
00:05:28.620 --> 00:05:30.690
it's usually Facebook messenger out of the blue.

90
00:05:30.900 --> 00:05:33.660
Don't respond from someone you haven't seen. They're like, Hey Dan,

91
00:05:33.900 --> 00:05:36.760
so nice to see you done it a long time. No. See,

92
00:05:37.050 --> 00:05:39.120
got a crazy business opportunity.

93
00:05:39.580 --> 00:05:42.300
I really want to talk to you about got time for coffee. No,

94
00:05:42.420 --> 00:05:47.250
you only got time for coffees a lot next meme. Okay.

95
00:05:47.280 --> 00:05:51.450
Finally, someone uses a picture of me, but it's the wrong picture of me.

96
00:05:52.320 --> 00:05:55.320
<v 1>You had your green screen material and did you.</v>

97
00:05:58.280 --> 00:06:03.250
<v 0>A circle of me? I don't know what this kind of, but it is.</v>

98
00:06:03.460 --> 00:06:05.380
Okay. First Photoshop, whatever.

99
00:06:05.530 --> 00:06:08.920
When Steven said get free gold from posting on his Reddit. He minutes.

100
00:06:09.070 --> 00:06:13.270
The greatest opportunity of our era. True guys. True.

101
00:06:13.271 --> 00:06:17.230
Actually I didn't mean that anyone who joined would get free gold,

102
00:06:17.260 --> 00:06:18.940
but that's how everybody interpreted it.

103
00:06:18.941 --> 00:06:23.320
I meant everybody who is on the Reddit at the time of me putting up that video

104
00:06:23.380 --> 00:06:28.240
got free gold, but everyone came looking for free gold. So I ended up, uh,

105
00:06:28.660 --> 00:06:31.180
scamming you. I don't know, pause to say it.

106
00:06:31.360 --> 00:06:34.330
I tried to give a lot of free gold away, but nonetheless,

107
00:06:34.360 --> 00:06:38.590
if you actually go to my subreddit right now, the number one, uh, top,

108
00:06:38.620 --> 00:06:39.520
top rated thing.

109
00:06:40.010 --> 00:06:42.670
<v 2>Is in Pete's coffee.</v>

110
00:06:44.440 --> 00:06:45.273
When you post it.

111
00:06:46.200 --> 00:06:48.490
<v 0>[Inaudible] separate at three days ago and didn't get the gold that was</v>

112
00:06:48.491 --> 00:06:52.660
promised. I did a promise code away to everybody. I don't think I did.

113
00:06:52.690 --> 00:06:57.080
I was trying to say that everyone who is on the separate at got free gold and it

114
00:06:57.081 --> 00:07:00.820
was going to become harder to get over time. But I okay. I scammed you guys.

115
00:07:00.821 --> 00:07:04.000
What can I say? Everyone came to the, to the subreddit, like, uh,

116
00:07:04.020 --> 00:07:07.650
the seagulls from finding Nemo, boomer reference Mike, Mike

117
00:07:12.970 --> 00:07:15.310
[inaudible] anyway, what's the meme. Uh,

118
00:07:15.610 --> 00:07:16.960
but didn't get the gold that was promised.

119
00:07:17.140 --> 00:07:19.960
I was a businessman doing business guys.

120
00:07:20.290 --> 00:07:24.160
He got it through the business to get the subreddit followers.

121
00:07:24.161 --> 00:07:26.320
That's all of that. It is in fact, look here.

122
00:07:26.470 --> 00:07:29.240
It's a new competition for you guys to get gold because the current offers off

123
00:07:29.300 --> 00:07:33.670
the table. Now, if you want to get gold, if you bring in three friends,

124
00:07:34.150 --> 00:07:37.180
you get gold. If you have three people in your downline,

125
00:07:37.210 --> 00:07:41.020
and if those three people also get three people, they get gold.

126
00:07:41.480 --> 00:07:45.730
If your three friends do that, you get platinum. That's an announcement. Hey,

127
00:07:46.540 --> 00:07:50.560
we're a pyramid scheme. Now that would be really funny. So get three friends in.

128
00:07:50.590 --> 00:07:53.320
If you could prove it and you can prove that those three friends got three

129
00:07:53.321 --> 00:07:55.720
friends to get platinum. That's it? That's it. That's how it's done.

130
00:07:56.410 --> 00:07:58.750
Announcing it right now. And don't worry. You won't get scammed.

131
00:07:58.751 --> 00:08:01.460
Remember how I did the last giveaway? So don't worry about that.

132
00:08:01.690 --> 00:08:04.330
Never scammed anybody in my life. Oh,

133
00:08:04.360 --> 00:08:07.480
they actually used the thing they use the green screen.

134
00:08:07.720 --> 00:08:11.530
I didn't even notice 25. Upvotes okay. Uh,

135
00:08:11.560 --> 00:08:15.790
did that beat the other guy? No, though.

136
00:08:15.920 --> 00:08:17.650
Guy who actually did the thing.

137
00:08:19.660 --> 00:08:21.520
<v 2>Okay. All right.</v>

138
00:08:22.000 --> 00:08:25.270
<v 0>Oh, here we go. Coffee Zilla got a P.</v>

139
00:08:25.930 --> 00:08:28.630
This is what I'm talking about. Yes,

140
00:08:29.830 --> 00:08:33.190
they did the thing. Copies of, look out a PhD and fakers.

141
00:08:33.191 --> 00:08:37.960
They use the green screen. Beautiful ma. Wow. I love it. Dreams.

142
00:08:37.961 --> 00:08:42.100
PhD, Harvard, astrophysics. Yeah. Guys. I,

143
00:08:42.190 --> 00:08:46.390

00:08:49.600 --> 00:08:54.310
He didn't cheat. Uh, yeah. Nice. Clever used,

uh, you know, use the call back. Is that the top voted one right now?

147
00:08:59.220 --> 00:09:04.050
That's out. I think that's the highest upvoted one. So far 36 votes.

148
00:09:04.080 --> 00:09:08.810
All right. Way to go. You're on your way to platinum. Sure.

149
00:09:09.620 --> 00:09:14.360
Uh, you, whatever. I don't know what that username is. Next meme guys.

150
00:09:14.390 --> 00:09:16.940
It was hard to find a picture of Dan Penia, smiling,

151
00:09:17.480 --> 00:09:22.070
coming to the sup to support your favorite YouTuber coming on the sub to receive

152
00:09:22.071 --> 00:09:26.090
a gold award. Wow. He actually is smiling.

153
00:09:26.120 --> 00:09:28.970
I think that is the first time I've seen Dan Pena smile. You know,

154
00:09:28.971 --> 00:09:32.870
a lot of dead Piney means he's a very well guy. I've got to give it to him.

155
00:09:32.871 --> 00:09:36.260
He's one of the most memorable gurus for sure. And I did give you gold. Okay.

156
00:09:36.261 --> 00:09:40.700
Notice that I'm not a con man. I came through on my promise. Okay.

157
00:09:41.600 --> 00:09:44.390
Came here for the Reddit gold. That's it. And as you can see,

158
00:09:44.750 --> 00:09:47.480
not a condom and I gave you Reddit gold. Okay.

159
00:09:47.960 --> 00:09:50.960
Cause right now people are demanding that I scammed everybody. Dude.

160
00:09:51.620 --> 00:09:53.540
I seriously gave gold to as many people as I could.

Which guys too many of you posted? What could I say? I demand. Copy to be.

162
00:09:58.130 --> 00:10:01.850
I investigated by himself on his own channel for not giving me the gold on the

00:10:01.851 --> 00:10:06.290
meme. I posted three days ago. Where's my gold seafood scammer of the year.

Time. It's actually pretty good.

Naka and get gold this time. No, you know what? Actually,

00:11:49.431 --> 00:11:52.280
And don't let anyone tell you guys otherwise please coffees.

189

Exposing upcoming fake gurus for the first time. Oh gee. Fake gurus. First time.

how do you do not see where this leads? It's a bad,

192
00:12:08.501 --> 00:12:10.840
it's a bad disliked decision. Not because of me,

00:12:30.010 --> 00:12:31.390
What is this Photoshop?

199
00:12:31.960 --> 00:12:36.550
You couldn't crop it in to make it seem like I just didn't have no feet.

200
00:12:37.150 --> 00:12:41.860
You wouldn't understand. And then by the way,

201
00:12:41.950 --> 00:12:46.750

A normal size toilet with a Hobbit on it. You're right.

203
00:12:50.110 --> 00:12:55.000
I need to slap whoever wrote the title for spreading fake news. What is this?

204
00:12:55.540 --> 00:12:59.470
Okay, let me say something guys. I'm sorry. I got to address this right now.

00:12:59.710 --> 00:13:02.740
Okay. This is, this is downright offensive.

My doctor badgered me the other day. He said I'm one Rogan tall. Maybe even too,

210
00:13:17.881 --> 00:13:22.470
like I'm like one to two Rogan's tall. And um, yeah,

211
00:13:22.500 --> 00:13:24.390
I don't want to be made fun of it for it anymore.

212
00:13:24.420 --> 00:13:29.220
I know the Hobbit meme was funny, but uh, it's not funny anymore.

213
00:13:29.700 --> 00:13:33.330
Okay. I'm outta here trying to fight the fake gurus and uh,
