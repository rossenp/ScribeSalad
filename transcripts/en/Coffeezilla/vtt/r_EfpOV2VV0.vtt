00:00:00.600 --> 00:00:03.180
<v 0>Alex, you put that gun down right now, or nobody's going to abandon YouTube.</v>

2
00:00:03.240 --> 00:00:07.140
How is YouTube gonna ban you when you have a gun out on your desk right now,

3
00:00:07.170 --> 00:00:10.710
calm down as your media buyer. I have to tell, I have to advise you.

4
00:00:10.950 --> 00:00:15.870
You can't be doing this right. You can't be doing this. Hang on,

5
00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:18.660
hang on Alex. One second. I got it. All right. I gotta leave.

6
00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:22.291
Sorry about that, boys.

7
00:00:22.291 --> 00:00:25.800
Money's getting a little tight since we bought the $10 million studio.

8
00:00:26.930 --> 00:00:29.670
Cashflow is not flowing in quite like I thought. Uh,

9
00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:34.230
I guess I went a little ambitious with this crazy studio, so I apologize,

10
00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:36.600
but picking up some extra shifts, uh, you know,

11
00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:40.200
don't hate a guy for where he works, please guys. Today,

12
00:00:40.201 --> 00:00:43.500
I want to talk about something that has nothing to do with old Jones today.

13
00:00:43.501 --> 00:00:47.070
I want to talk about Jeff Bezos and the people take an advantage.

14
00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:50.160
Ladies and gentlemen, welcome to just one scam.

15
00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:54.780
That's what I'm titling this video today. We're talking about just one dime,

16
00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:58.650
which is a company selling another Amazon automation course.

17
00:00:58.830 --> 00:01:00.960
So we're going to decide, should you invest your money in this course?

18
00:01:00.961 --> 00:01:03.450
How should you think about this course, guys? Now,

19
00:01:03.451 --> 00:01:07.320
why am I qualified to tell you that? Right. Uh, you know,

20
00:01:07.321 --> 00:01:12.120
am I some business expert, right? I mean,

21
00:01:12.121 --> 00:01:16.260
you decide, you decide, it's just basically me,

22
00:01:16.261 --> 00:01:21.150
Amazon and Dan Locke, the top three businessmen of our era. And uh,

23
00:01:21.151 --> 00:01:24.570
yeah. So I am qualified to talk about it in case you were wondering,

24
00:01:25.230 --> 00:01:29.040
absolutely have very serious business skills that are not a joke,

25
00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:32.880
but we're just going to talk about common sense, risk management.

26
00:01:32.881 --> 00:01:34.650
Because let me tell you guys everything.

27
00:01:34.651 --> 00:01:39.150
This guy does is something that I like to call risk for the

28
00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:43.170
none for me. Right? You want to stay away from these people.

29
00:01:43.440 --> 00:01:45.960
These people want to saddle you with all the problems.

30
00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:49.890
If anything goes upside down, right? Because if investments go well,

31
00:01:49.891 --> 00:01:53.160
everyone's happy. Obviously, sometimes investments go, well,

32
00:01:53.190 --> 00:01:57.630
sometimes they don't. Now what happens when things go sideways,

33
00:01:57.660 --> 00:01:59.490
the people who were in Stephen mayor's course,

34
00:01:59.491 --> 00:02:01.290
if you saw my last video on Amazon automation,

35
00:02:01.470 --> 00:02:06.330
this guy ran off with $12 million. What are those people going to do? Right?

36
00:02:06.570 --> 00:02:09.990
The downside happened. What are they going to do? Well, you might say Steven,

37
00:02:09.991 --> 00:02:12.990
they'll just Sue. Yeah. Guess what Steven Mayer is going to do.

38
00:02:13.020 --> 00:02:16.080
He's going to defend himself with the money that they paid him.

39
00:02:16.410 --> 00:02:18.390
There are no lose, lose situation. They don't have any money.

40
00:02:18.510 --> 00:02:20.670
Cause they already paid it to the scam. And now what are they gonna do?

41
00:02:20.671 --> 00:02:21.510
They're gonna try to get it back,

42
00:02:21.511 --> 00:02:24.630
how he's going to fight them with their own money.

43
00:02:25.350 --> 00:02:28.920
So that's what you guys have to think about. What happens when things go bad,

44
00:02:29.310 --> 00:02:30.600
pay attention to this guys,

45
00:02:30.900 --> 00:02:33.810
because this guy's going to pretend like they're not like the other gurus.

46
00:02:33.840 --> 00:02:36.120
They're different. Let's listen in.

47
00:02:36.420 --> 00:02:38.570
<v 1>Not sacrifice our credibility for money.</v>

48
00:02:38.960 --> 00:02:42.500
It takes years to build the credibility we have compared to all the so-called

49
00:02:42.530 --> 00:02:43.363
gurus.

50
00:02:43.790 --> 00:02:45.080
<v 0>All right, stop right there.</v>

51
00:02:45.140 --> 00:02:48.380
These people need to stop saying I'm not like those other guys.

52
00:02:48.381 --> 00:02:51.350
I'm totally different. They all say that right to hell. Say that.

53
00:02:51.620 --> 00:02:54.230
<v 1>Who claimed Amazon automation and all they want is the upfront feed.</v>

54
00:02:54.231 --> 00:02:58.850
Then be give a crap about you. You get, you can lose your reputation in five,

55
00:02:59.520 --> 00:03:00.040
but let's just start.

56
00:03:00.040 --> 00:03:04.480
<v 0>With that. Right? Okay. No high fees, high fees upfront scam.</v>

57
00:03:04.481 --> 00:03:06.940
Because they're just trying to run away with you at the high fees. Well,

58
00:03:06.941 --> 00:03:10.300
let's see. What did Steven Merrick charge? I think it was like $30,000.

59
00:03:10.330 --> 00:03:13.090
So what's this guy charged. He must be charging a lot less, right?

60
00:03:13.560 --> 00:03:17.040
<v 1>Is $10,000 fee per product. Okay.</v>

61
00:03:17.520 --> 00:03:19.620
That does not include the cost of the product.

62
00:03:19.621 --> 00:03:24.390
You have to pay $10,000 per product and you have to start

63
00:03:24.391 --> 00:03:27.060
with three. So it's $30,000.

64
00:03:27.061 --> 00:03:30.420
So your minimum upfront investment is 30,000 no less.

65
00:03:31.380 --> 00:03:36.210
<v 0>So you just criticize people with high fees. Cause you're like, Oh yeah,</v>

66
00:03:36.720 --> 00:03:38.490
they're just going to run away. And they don't care about you,

67
00:03:38.850 --> 00:03:41.460
but then you're doing the exact same thing.

68
00:03:42.030 --> 00:03:44.700
But maybe I just don't understand how much money you're going to be making.

69
00:03:44.701 --> 00:03:45.090
I mean,

70
00:03:45.090 --> 00:03:49.740
you must be balling if you're going to put in 30 K minimum plus product

71
00:03:49.741 --> 00:03:54.600
costs, maybe another 10 K each puts you at 60 K all in. So you must,

72
00:03:54.630 --> 00:03:56.880
must be making a lot of money. How much money you making Seth.

73
00:03:57.360 --> 00:04:00.120
<v 1>A conservative ROI. We've gone through the numbers.</v>

74
00:04:00.121 --> 00:04:04.110
So many times a conservative ROI within 12 months is

75
00:04:04.111 --> 00:04:05.280
200%.

76
00:04:07.470 --> 00:04:12.180
<v 0>Woo. 200% interesting. Okay. Okay.</v>

77
00:04:12.310 --> 00:04:13.230
Seth, I'm listening.

78
00:04:13.890 --> 00:04:17.070
<v 1>Show me any real estate. Any stocks, anyone out there,</v>

79
00:04:17.100 --> 00:04:21.480
even for angel investors who get an ROI like that with this loan.

80
00:04:21.670 --> 00:04:25.290
<v 0>Risk now what's he basing this off of? He says he ran the numbers, right?</v>

81
00:04:25.291 --> 00:04:28.200
What's he basing this off of, I mean, is he making a guarantee.

82
00:04:28.440 --> 00:04:31.950
<v 1>Seth? Can you give me a guarantee? No. Okay.</v>

83
00:04:32.760 --> 00:04:33.540
Learning the numbers.

84
00:04:33.540 --> 00:04:37.950
Your minimum ROI is around 200% mint in numb bum.

85
00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:41.880
<v 0>Is that not a guarantee? Wait, does that sound like a guarantee to you.</v>

86
00:04:42.420 --> 00:04:46.140
<v 1>Running the numbers? Your minimum ROI is around 200%.</v>

87
00:04:46.350 --> 00:04:48.690
What number numbers? Your minimum ROI.

88
00:04:48.930 --> 00:04:50.640
<v 0>What numbers, Hey, what numbers.</v>

89
00:04:51.160 --> 00:04:52.320
<v 1>Running the numbers?</v>

90
00:04:52.380 --> 00:04:57.210
Your minimum ROI is around 200% minimum, 500%.

91
00:04:57.300 --> 00:04:59.580
A thousand percent like that's minimum within a year. Okay.

92
00:04:59.581 --> 00:05:02.010
Which is insane that isn't saying,

93
00:05:02.310 --> 00:05:06.360
compare that to where are you getting that from though? Additionally,

94
00:05:06.540 --> 00:05:10.980
additionally, the chances of us failing at a product are so ridiculously slim.

95
00:05:10.981 --> 00:05:13.740
It's not even funny for every 100 products. I launch.

96
00:05:13.950 --> 00:05:16.590
Three of them are not as profitable as I hoped.

97
00:05:16.650 --> 00:05:20.280
Three is that puts you in a pretty ridiculously good case.

98
00:05:20.360 --> 00:05:23.760
Now let's just say worst case scenario. We've launched three. One of them fails.

99
00:05:23.880 --> 00:05:25.890
You still make money. Why? Because this,

100
00:05:26.310 --> 00:05:29.790
the success of the two more than makes up for the loss of the one.

101
00:05:30.030 --> 00:05:33.510
<v 0>But set. That's not the worst case, baby. Hey, am I crazy?</v>

102
00:05:33.540 --> 00:05:37.380
Or is the worst case scenario that three of them fail all three and then you're

103
00:05:37.381 --> 00:05:38.610
left with nothing.

104
00:05:39.630 --> 00:05:42.330
<v 1>Worst case scenario. We've launched three. One of them fails.</v>

105
00:05:42.680 --> 00:05:45.750
<v 0>Just not the worst case scenario and like sure.</v>

106
00:05:45.900 --> 00:05:46.860
You're giving a money back guarantee.

107
00:05:46.920 --> 00:05:49.350
Are you so confident that you're giving a money back guarantee?

108
00:05:49.740 --> 00:05:52.140
<v 1>I Seth, can you give me a guarantee? No.</v>

109
00:05:52.380 --> 00:05:56.850
<v 0>So all of that's annoying, but that's not what really me off. This is,</v>

110
00:05:56.990 --> 00:05:58.070
but that's just the beginning.

111
00:05:58.070 --> 00:06:00.800
<v 1>Of the fees. Let me explain all of them to you. Talk about transparency.</v>

112
00:06:00.890 --> 00:06:01.723
Here we go.

113
00:06:02.270 --> 00:06:07.250
15% of total sales revenue due every three months goes to us.

114
00:06:07.660 --> 00:06:12.550
<v 0>Sales revenue boys. He's taking 15% of your sales revenue.</v>

115
00:06:12.970 --> 00:06:15.280
<v 1>And I'll explain why we don't do profit. And it's actually in your favor.</v>

116
00:06:15.340 --> 00:06:16.210
It may not seem like that.

117
00:06:18.910 --> 00:06:21.160
<v 0>Let's watch him do that. Mental gymnastics again, dude.</v>

118
00:06:21.161 --> 00:06:23.350
It's like watching a gold medalist on the floor.

119
00:06:23.780 --> 00:06:26.140
<v 1>No explain why we don't do profit. And it's actually in your favorite.</v>

120
00:06:26.141 --> 00:06:27.880
May not seem like that. I will explain that in a minute.

121
00:06:28.600 --> 00:06:32.860
<v 0>Okay. Did you guys just hear that? So not only is he charging $30,000, right?</v>

122
00:06:32.861 --> 00:06:36.640
This guy, he says 200% minimum ROI, but if it doesn't happen, it's not on me.

123
00:06:37.330 --> 00:06:41.860
Then he goes, okay, I'm charging you 15% of your revenue.

124
00:06:42.070 --> 00:06:44.110
Meaning if you're making no money,

125
00:06:44.350 --> 00:06:45.910
but you made a hundred thousand dollars in sales,

126
00:06:45.911 --> 00:06:50.530
but you've spent it all on product and margins and all this kind of stuff. PBC,

127
00:06:51.190 --> 00:06:55.840
guess what? You still have to pay him $15,000. That's right. Gentlemen,

128
00:06:56.170 --> 00:06:59.440
Seth wants 15% of your money. Even if you're making no money at all.

129
00:06:59.441 --> 00:07:02.230
And he says, that's in your favor. He goes, I was going to do profit,

130
00:07:02.231 --> 00:07:06.460
but then I decided it's in your favor. Now watch this boys.

131
00:07:06.461 --> 00:07:07.780
This stuff drives me crazy.

132
00:07:08.410 --> 00:07:12.730
<v 1>How do you justify the 15% revenue share? This seems high. Is this negotiable?</v>

133
00:07:12.760 --> 00:07:13.750
No, it is not negotiable.

134
00:07:13.751 --> 00:07:15.820
Let me explain why we've been through this enough to know.

135
00:07:16.150 --> 00:07:18.730
Let me just give you an example. When we first started this program,

136
00:07:18.731 --> 00:07:22.000
we have the idea of doing a 30% net profit share.

137
00:07:22.001 --> 00:07:23.750
And I know upfront that sounds better,

138
00:07:23.860 --> 00:07:26.380
but it is better because we don't make money. Unless you make.

139
00:07:26.410 --> 00:07:28.960
<v 0>Money. It's a terrible decision. Either way,</v>

140
00:07:28.961 --> 00:07:32.350
30% is way too much of your profits, but okay. It's, it's better. Yeah.

141
00:07:32.470 --> 00:07:35.230
<v 1>And I get that and that was my original goal. But the more we did it,</v>

142
00:07:35.231 --> 00:07:37.480
the more I realized this is a problem. Let me give you an example.

143
00:07:38.050 --> 00:07:41.230
Let's say we sell a hundred thousand dollars worth of these.

144
00:07:41.340 --> 00:07:43.810
Let's just say your profit was a hundred thousand to keep it simple.

145
00:07:45.040 --> 00:07:48.070
When do we get our 30,000? Because that back then it was 30,000. Now,

146
00:07:48.880 --> 00:07:53.830
if we get it, now there's a problem because that means you have less money

147
00:07:54.640 --> 00:07:58.960
to buy the next batch, which means your per unit cost will be greater.

148
00:07:59.050 --> 00:08:00.790
Which means your margins will be thinner.

149
00:08:00.940 --> 00:08:02.410
<v 0>Wait, stop. He says,</v>

150
00:08:02.620 --> 00:08:05.530
I can't take away from your profits because then you wouldn't have enough money

151
00:08:05.531 --> 00:08:08.770
to invest Seth you beautiful idiot.

152
00:08:09.340 --> 00:08:13.510
Do you not understand that? If you take away from the sales revenue,

153
00:08:13.750 --> 00:08:16.270
their margins will also be thinner. I mean,

154
00:08:16.271 --> 00:08:19.930
I don't know if this guy is willfully while I know it's willfully. He's just,

155
00:08:20.650 --> 00:08:24.910
he knows that taken away from revenues way worse for the customer,

156
00:08:24.911 --> 00:08:25.930
but way better for him.

157
00:08:26.710 --> 00:08:31.630
And he knows that the margins are going to be affected either way and

158
00:08:31.631 --> 00:08:33.730
his whole problem of when do we take the money? Well,

159
00:08:33.731 --> 00:08:36.190
the same question applies to when you take sales revenue,

160
00:08:36.191 --> 00:08:38.200
what do you take it at the beginning before someone's profitable.

161
00:08:38.470 --> 00:08:40.780
You could just replace exactly what he said was sales revenue.

162
00:08:40.781 --> 00:08:41.950
It would make just as much sense.

163
00:08:42.310 --> 00:08:46.390
All of this is a big fat distraction from the truth,

164
00:08:46.900 --> 00:08:49.510
which is that there's no good reason for him to take from your sales revenue

165
00:08:49.840 --> 00:08:50.673
zero,

166
00:08:50.860 --> 00:08:55.000
but he wants to take from it anyway because it makes him more say it with me,

167
00:08:55.020 --> 00:08:58.250
say it with me Monday. It makes him more my knee.

168
00:08:58.251 --> 00:09:00.090
And he likes that like seriously,

169
00:09:00.091 --> 00:09:03.840
it's so funny listening to this guy really struggle with the concept because

170
00:09:04.200 --> 00:09:07.470
he's basically saying, Oh yeah, I couldn't fathom taking away from your profits.

171
00:09:07.471 --> 00:09:09.690
That would be unfair. I mean, how could I do that to you?

172
00:09:09.810 --> 00:09:12.210
When he's planning to take away from your sales revenue,

173
00:09:12.630 --> 00:09:15.870
he could just do the same thing with the profits. It doesn't make any sense.

174
00:09:16.230 --> 00:09:20.940
Again. Everything's for him to win. Even if he doesn't do his job. Even if Seth,

175
00:09:20.970 --> 00:09:23.010
Seth, the boy, you know, if everything goes South,

176
00:09:23.011 --> 00:09:27.960
because he screws up your store, does he lose? Does he not make his cashflow?

177
00:09:28.140 --> 00:09:29.820
No. He still makes the baby.

178
00:09:30.270 --> 00:09:34.200
And it's funny because this is the guy who's saying 200% minimum ROI. It is.

179
00:09:34.201 --> 00:09:38.460
We ran a whole bunch of numbers. Oh my God said enough with the numbers, sir.

180
00:09:39.140 --> 00:09:43.550
And we are erring on the side of you making more than if it was a 30% net

181
00:09:43.551 --> 00:09:47.570
margin. Oh boy, let's go back.

182
00:09:47.870 --> 00:09:52.280
And we are erring on the side of you making more than if it was a 30% net

183
00:09:52.281 --> 00:09:53.114
margin,

184
00:09:53.180 --> 00:09:57.350
you cannot believe that there's no way you believe that it airs on that side.

185
00:09:57.500 --> 00:10:00.110
We've run it a hundred times every way. How,

186
00:10:00.200 --> 00:10:03.050
how have you run it a hundred times? A hundred different ways. Listen,

187
00:10:03.080 --> 00:10:04.970
it's actually very simple. All right.

188
00:10:04.971 --> 00:10:09.560
If you charge 15% sales revenue versus 30% profit,

189
00:10:09.830 --> 00:10:14.630
there's only one condition in which 30% net profit is worse for the

190
00:10:14.631 --> 00:10:18.020
customer than 15% net revenue. You want to know what it is. Here's what it is.

191
00:10:18.380 --> 00:10:22.520
If your profit margins are over 50%,

192
00:10:22.790 --> 00:10:25.670
which is great for the customer, they're making money. They're happy.

193
00:10:26.270 --> 00:10:29.240
Then it's better for them. If you're taking 30% revenue.

194
00:10:29.510 --> 00:10:32.720
So if it dips below that, let's say it gets to 30%, right?

195
00:10:32.750 --> 00:10:34.670
30% profit margins.

196
00:10:35.090 --> 00:10:38.030
Guess what sets still takes is 15% cut.

197
00:10:38.300 --> 00:10:40.430
And now your profits have been hacked.

198
00:10:40.460 --> 00:10:43.910
He's taking an effective 50% cut of your profits.

199
00:10:44.090 --> 00:10:48.410
So guess who it benefits again, I, again, this guy,

200
00:10:48.411 --> 00:10:49.310
all the while,

201
00:10:49.340 --> 00:10:53.420
he's trying to dupe you into believing that you're going to be making more

202
00:10:53.421 --> 00:10:56.810
money. If you go this way, look at him. I ran it a hundred different ways.

203
00:10:56.811 --> 00:10:57.890
What we've done it every way.

204
00:10:58.070 --> 00:11:02.450
And we are erring on the side of you making more than if it was a 30% net

205
00:11:02.451 --> 00:11:04.160
margin. It airs on that side.

206
00:11:04.310 --> 00:11:07.280
We'd run it a hundred times every way he's done it every way, guys.

207
00:11:07.540 --> 00:11:09.350
And he doesn't understand how the math works any other way.

208
00:11:09.410 --> 00:11:10.940
It doesn't make any sense. Guys.

209
00:11:11.030 --> 00:11:13.730
You have to understand that these people are not your friend.

210
00:11:14.630 --> 00:11:17.690
They're not doing it for the good of humanity, right?

211
00:11:17.691 --> 00:11:19.310
If they wanted to scale up their business,

212
00:11:19.311 --> 00:11:24.230
this guy is all about scaling up his business. Then go take out a loan.

213
00:11:24.290 --> 00:11:27.860
That's what it's called. It's called a loan. Think about the following facts.

214
00:11:27.950 --> 00:11:31.520
Okay. He's saying that you're virtually no risk, right?

215
00:11:31.521 --> 00:11:34.430
Because 97% of his products succeed.

216
00:11:34.520 --> 00:11:36.710
They're just as profitable as he thought they were.

217
00:11:36.860 --> 00:11:41.360
And he's also saying you have a minimum ROI of 200%, right?

218
00:11:41.450 --> 00:11:43.610
So that means that he could do the same thing with the story of his own,

219
00:11:43.611 --> 00:11:47.360
make 200% on his money. So let's say he goes out to a bank, right?

220
00:11:47.390 --> 00:11:50.750
He goes into a bank, takes out a gigantic loan on 20% interest.

221
00:11:50.780 --> 00:11:54.280
If it's a minimum ROI of 200%, no big deal. Right?

222
00:11:54.430 --> 00:11:55.180
Cause he's still making money.

223
00:11:55.180 --> 00:11:58.570
He's making all of the profit instead what he's saying, Hey,

224
00:11:58.571 --> 00:12:02.620
I thought it was a better idea. If I partner with you guys, partner with you,

225
00:12:02.621 --> 00:12:06.160
small investors, where you take the majority of the cut,

226
00:12:06.730 --> 00:12:09.280
that doesn't make any sense. But I just want to add this part in,

227
00:12:09.520 --> 00:12:13.540
I'm editing this in post. Cause I, I was watching the whole thing again.

228
00:12:13.541 --> 00:12:16.300
And I wanted to say one thing that this guy does. Right? Okay.

229
00:12:16.480 --> 00:12:19.450
Which is that he says that if you don't have the money, don't join.

230
00:12:19.780 --> 00:12:24.010
I don't want you sending me the last pieces of money you have and going broke.

231
00:12:24.040 --> 00:12:27.130
Don't do it. I criticize gurus all the time about this.

232
00:12:27.430 --> 00:12:30.550
They always try to get everybody in this guy. He says,

233
00:12:30.551 --> 00:12:33.700
if you don't have the money don't join. I did like that. Respect for that.

234
00:12:33.730 --> 00:12:37.570
I think it's a terrible investment opportunity. That's just my opinion.

235
00:12:37.840 --> 00:12:40.900
I think this guy has protected himself from every single downside.

236
00:12:41.080 --> 00:12:44.980
All the while telling you that you need to risk every penny. Okay?

237
00:12:45.010 --> 00:12:45.843
That's what he's doing.

238
00:12:46.120 --> 00:12:51.070
But I'll say that at least he's not targeting poor people. So for that,

239
00:12:51.071 --> 00:12:52.780
you get a coffee's a little one-star.

240
00:12:53.020 --> 00:12:56.920
The thing is guys is with all of these programs, you have to be thinking,

241
00:12:56.921 --> 00:13:00.610
what if it goes wrong? What if this guy who seems so charming?

242
00:13:00.730 --> 00:13:04.990
He's smiling at me saying what a good guy. He is saying,

243
00:13:04.991 --> 00:13:06.880
how much he cares about me. I care about you, buddy.

244
00:13:07.300 --> 00:13:09.640
You gotta think what if this guy is lying to you?

245
00:13:09.641 --> 00:13:12.040
What if he's not telling you the truth? What's your downside.

246
00:13:12.640 --> 00:13:16.000
They stick you with all the risk. They stick you with all the problems.

247
00:13:16.001 --> 00:13:19.000
They pretend to be so competent in their courses. But at the end of the day,

248
00:13:19.001 --> 00:13:23.710
when you dig down, can you get your money back? No baby. No.

249
00:13:23.770 --> 00:13:27.730
If they fail, that's on you. Even if they kind of flounder,

250
00:13:27.850 --> 00:13:30.790
that's also on you because they'll take your sales revenue. Do what a joke.

251
00:13:30.820 --> 00:13:33.100
Anyway, this is your daily reminder to not fall for the idiots.

252
00:13:33.101 --> 00:13:35.050
Call the clowns out and dissolve.
