00:00:00.210 --> 00:00:05.010
<v 0>So when it's all said and done prepare to have 20 to 30 beautiful</v>

2
00:00:05.011 --> 00:00:05.520
women,

3
00:00:05.520 --> 00:00:10.380
you get to select from like a dollar menu at McDonald's.

4
00:00:13.880 --> 00:00:16.160
<v 1>I'm not so sure you want to be taking this guy's advice. You know,</v>

5
00:00:17.870 --> 00:00:21.650
the dollar menu, I mean, comes in clutch in a pinch, but, um,

6
00:00:23.420 --> 00:00:27.980
I don't, I don't know that that's the type of, I don't know.

7
00:00:28.190 --> 00:00:30.470
<v 0>Like a dollar menu and McDonald's,</v>

8
00:00:31.190 --> 00:00:33.320
let me tell you a little about who the hell I am.

9
00:00:33.800 --> 00:00:38.180
<v 1>Oh boy, here we go again guys, if you don't know who the hell this is,</v>

10
00:00:38.181 --> 00:00:41.630
this is Adrian G. We talked about him in our last video,

11
00:00:41.631 --> 00:00:45.680
but he's back and better than ever. Last time he was telling us how to get rich.

12
00:00:45.710 --> 00:00:46.130
Boy.

13
00:00:46.130 --> 00:00:49.760
<v 0>You had to make six figures a year by working just one day a week from your</v>

14
00:00:49.761 --> 00:00:50.594
laptop.

15
00:00:50.810 --> 00:00:53.030
<v 1>This time he's telling you how to get laid.</v>

16
00:00:53.300 --> 00:00:54.960
<v 0>I'm a world renowned dating group.</v>

17
00:00:55.130 --> 00:00:58.730
<v 1>This man is apparently an expert in the art of pickup.</v>

18
00:00:59.090 --> 00:01:03.050
He's an artist. They call themselves pickup artists in this community.

19
00:01:03.290 --> 00:01:04.460
They charge insecure men,

20
00:01:04.490 --> 00:01:08.510
a lot of money to teach them how to be more confident with the ladies.

21
00:01:08.810 --> 00:01:12.650
<v 0>My name is Adrian grew Shaw, but since we soon share a brotherhood,</v>

22
00:01:12.651 --> 00:01:15.170
you can just call me Adrian G or G.

23
00:01:16.220 --> 00:01:18.890
<v 1>That's right. You're about to join the simp brotherhood,</v>

24
00:01:19.190 --> 00:01:22.550
the nights of the single table, the fellowship of the cell.

25
00:01:22.970 --> 00:01:27.080
But this guy in particular, it's shady.

26
00:01:27.081 --> 00:01:31.340
He's given off some serious, um, B vibes. Some serious. Yes.

27
00:01:31.341 --> 00:01:33.890
Means no vibes. If you catch my drift.

28
00:01:34.250 --> 00:01:34.251
<v 0>Well,</v>

29
00:01:34.251 --> 00:01:38.510
I've been teaching guys how to bag the world's sexiest women like groceries for

30
00:01:38.511 --> 00:01:39.380
the past four weeks.

31
00:01:39.410 --> 00:01:43.100
<v 1>Yes. And there's warning, flag. Number one</v>

32
00:01:45.410 --> 00:01:48.920
bag and Wayman like groceries. Adrian. That's a little creepy. My man,

33
00:01:49.430 --> 00:01:49.850
it's weird.

34
00:01:49.850 --> 00:01:52.820
I've been calling your women like they're from a McDonald's dollar menu.

35
00:01:53.780 --> 00:01:54.613
Very strict.

36
00:01:54.740 --> 00:01:59.060
<v 0>I got online and feverish. He began studying all the greatest pickup artists,</v>

37
00:01:59.540 --> 00:02:02.720
such as mystery, Neil Strauss, JT, Tran,

38
00:02:02.900 --> 00:02:06.050
and plenty of others until I couldn't stop my brain anymore.

39
00:02:06.980 --> 00:02:11.510
I was now programmed to learn and master the art of dropping panties.

40
00:02:11.511 --> 00:02:12.800
Without me even asking.

41
00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:15.380
<v 1>Are you trying to meet to yourself right now?</v>

42
00:02:15.800 --> 00:02:16.970
They're going to look back on this.

43
00:02:16.971 --> 00:02:21.380
Like we should have known all the things he was saying here.

44
00:02:21.410 --> 00:02:25.010
We should have known all the lock adds a little suspicious,

45
00:02:25.610 --> 00:02:30.440
very suspicious. But if you can believe it, it gets even worse. Imagine.

46
00:02:32.870 --> 00:02:37.760
<v 0>All work that goes into creating a new cure for a disease.</v>

47
00:02:38.210 --> 00:02:41.600
No, all the field tests and clinical trials.

48
00:02:42.200 --> 00:02:45.380
<v 1>No, don't do it. Don't compare yourself to a scientist.</v>

49
00:02:45.680 --> 00:02:48.380
<v 0>And that is the level I was doing. This maniac or research.</v>

50
00:02:49.040 --> 00:02:51.380
<v 1>Ah, there he goes.</v>

51
00:02:51.410 --> 00:02:56.390
He's trying to give himself the Nobel prize pick up right now. Relax.

52
00:02:56.420 --> 00:03:00.730
You're a narcissistic 20 year old. You're not Einstein, but believe it or not,

53
00:03:01.090 --> 00:03:02.800
it gets even worse.

54
00:03:02.880 --> 00:03:07.500
<v 0>And just kept on learning and interacting and testing out thousands of methods</v>

55
00:03:07.590 --> 00:03:12.570
on my new prey. Hello?

56
00:03:12.571 --> 00:03:14.670
Nine 11 group.

57
00:03:15.060 --> 00:03:19.980
<v 1>Imagine calling yourself the master of women and then calling them prey</v>

58
00:03:20.820 --> 00:03:24.740
and saying you're bagging them like groceries, dude,

59
00:03:24.741 --> 00:03:27.990
this guy has never done anything, but play some kind of wife who simulator.

60
00:03:27.991 --> 00:03:32.520
This guy has no experience with real women. Actually, I take that back.

61
00:03:32.550 --> 00:03:35.250
I've been looking into it fast forward future Steven year,

62
00:03:35.640 --> 00:03:38.370
actually he does have some experience with women.

63
00:03:38.371 --> 00:03:42.330
He has experienced hiring actors for his pranks, in fact,

64
00:03:42.690 --> 00:03:45.270
cause he ran a social experiment channel. He's one of these guys,

65
00:03:45.660 --> 00:03:50.490
but he actually got caught out for some of his pranks pranks, right? Uh, for,

66
00:03:50.700 --> 00:03:52.290
for them being absolutely fake.

67
00:03:52.470 --> 00:03:55.470
<v 0>Oh, video's a lie. Cause everyone. Yeah. That's an actor. Yeah.</v>

68
00:03:56.190 --> 00:04:00.630
But you haven't revealed that to anyone. Yeah. Right. Is that right? I mean, no,

69
00:04:00.631 --> 00:04:01.464
that's not right.

70
00:04:01.650 --> 00:04:05.370
<v 1>Yeah. My man is caught in the act and he goes, yeah, that's right. Wait, wait,</v>

71
00:04:05.400 --> 00:04:07.290
no. Uh, wait, uh, what was it.

72
00:04:07.830 --> 00:04:09.660
<v 0>Question? This is the girl at Glen elk.</v>

73
00:04:10.050 --> 00:04:13.500
Let tells you this is one of the other girls. They're all actors.

74
00:04:13.530 --> 00:04:16.890
They all follow your profile, your acting profile on style.

75
00:04:16.920 --> 00:04:20.920
Now that's just creepy, dude. I think we're done. We.

76
00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:23.310
<v 1>Need those kinds of reporters in America. Where are those reporters?</v>

77
00:04:23.460 --> 00:04:26.130
<v 0>That's nice. Seriously. That's just creepy. What do you do that?</v>

78
00:04:26.460 --> 00:04:30.570
<v 1>It turns out all that methodical research he was doing was looking for actors.</v>

79
00:04:30.660 --> 00:04:33.660
<v 0>He's admitted. This clip too was staged</v>

80
00:04:37.050 --> 00:04:38.010
as were others.

81
00:04:38.190 --> 00:04:42.270
Here's an ad looking for girls to be in another video with offers of a cash

82
00:04:42.300 --> 00:04:42.810
payment.

83
00:04:42.810 --> 00:04:46.920
<v 1>This is the guy we're dealing with guys. This is the pickup master. Anyways,</v>

84
00:04:46.921 --> 00:04:49.170
guys, let's get back into the, into the video.

85
00:04:49.380 --> 00:04:51.270
<v 0>To be honest in this economy,</v>

86
00:04:51.271 --> 00:04:54.540
I had originally planned to give the system away for absolutely.

87
00:04:54.780 --> 00:04:56.850
<v 1>The free he's going to try to justify it voice.</v>

88
00:04:57.090 --> 00:05:00.710
Tell me if you think his justification makes any sense. Okay. He,

89
00:05:00.711 --> 00:05:02.670
he wants to give it to you for free.

90
00:05:02.880 --> 00:05:07.110
<v 0>That is until I realized such a move would turn out to be counterproductive and</v>

91
00:05:07.111 --> 00:05:09.270
ruin the mission of what I actually set out to.

92
00:05:09.271 --> 00:05:12.330
Do you see if this info was given away,

93
00:05:12.780 --> 00:05:15.900
it would saturate the Bay market and your stock would crash.

94
00:05:16.530 --> 00:05:20.310
<v 1>My man's out here on some NASDAQ. He's uh, he's the standards and Poor's man.</v>

95
00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:25.170
<v 0>I call it the potential Bay bubble and that C</v>

96
00:05:25.290 --> 00:05:26.123
yes.

97
00:05:26.910 --> 00:05:30.390
<v 1>He's worried about the great 2008 babe crash. Again,</v>

98
00:05:30.420 --> 00:05:32.880
he doesn't want to be responsible for that. So he's doing the only thing.

99
00:05:32.881 --> 00:05:36.420
He knows how and charging outrageous sums of money for obvious.

100
00:05:37.140 --> 00:05:39.360
<v 0>And that is why I made the decision.</v>

101
00:05:39.540 --> 00:05:42.600
I must charge for this program for your protection.

102
00:05:43.410 --> 00:05:47.100
Can't you just feel his sincerity there. I must charge for this program.

103
00:05:47.400 --> 00:05:49.560
I'll be honest. This pickup artistry stuff.

104
00:05:50.280 --> 00:05:54.900
<v 1>Pretty freaking weird women pick up on this kind of stuff they can tell when</v>

105
00:05:54.901 --> 00:05:57.830
you're thinking to yourself, Ooh, look at what my new praise doing.

106
00:05:57.831 --> 00:06:01.610
You're going to smell it on you from a mile away. Not going to go well.

107
00:06:01.611 --> 00:06:02.181
So anyway,

108
00:06:02.181 --> 00:06:06.830
I just wanted to share that with you guys have a little laugh with me about the

109
00:06:06.831 --> 00:06:10.820
insanity of Adrian G anyway, that's it for now.

00:06:11.980 --> 00:06:16.480
