00:00:00.240 --> 00:00:04.410
<v 0>A kids coding camp is suing critic for speaking out against them.</v>

2
00:00:04.411 --> 00:00:07.170
This is a coding camp named white hat Jr.

3
00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:11.600
They're one of India's big startups and they're in hot water in response.

4
00:00:11.900 --> 00:00:15.860
The mountain criticism they're suing one man named Pradeep ponia I hope I got

5
00:00:15.861 --> 00:00:20.720
that name right for $2.7 million in damages. Okay.

6
00:00:20.721 --> 00:00:22.940
They're accusing of defamation, all sorts of stuff,

7
00:00:22.941 --> 00:00:25.970
which we're going to get into, but they say, look,

8
00:00:25.971 --> 00:00:30.350
it's not because the guy criticized us. It's because he criticized us unfairly.

9
00:00:30.740 --> 00:00:34.790
According to them, legitimate, honest fact-based criticism is truly welcome.

10
00:00:35.360 --> 00:00:38.000
Well, good guy. So they should have no problem with this video right here.

11
00:00:38.200 --> 00:00:39.320
Cause we're going to get to the bottom of this.

12
00:00:39.350 --> 00:00:42.200
We're going to explain what's been going on because I've been looking into this

13
00:00:42.440 --> 00:00:46.640
and what I found is truly astonishing and we're going to take it from the

14
00:00:46.641 --> 00:00:51.590
beginning. Okay, well let's talk code camps real quick. They're giant right now.

15
00:00:51.620 --> 00:00:52.850
It's a gold rush.

16
00:00:52.970 --> 00:00:57.380
Well rather coding is a gold rush and the coding camps or the people selling

17
00:00:57.381 --> 00:01:00.440
shovels, uh, there's a lot of money in selling shovels.

18
00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:04.430
A lot of these coding camps are charging thousands of dollars to teach coding

19
00:01:04.431 --> 00:01:08.840
and they basically hang an Apple or Google job in front of their applicants and

20
00:01:08.841 --> 00:01:09.500
say, well,

21
00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:13.010
isn't it worth it to pay us thousands of dollars to get this education. Now,

22
00:01:13.040 --> 00:01:16.130
one of the things that should be noted is there's a lot of free coding

23
00:01:16.670 --> 00:01:19.430
educations out there, like free code camp.org and many others.

24
00:01:19.460 --> 00:01:22.400
But some people want to go down the paid route because they think they're going

25
00:01:22.401 --> 00:01:23.870
to get a better education.

26
00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:27.980
White hat junior is the latest of many coding camps offering such a thing.

27
00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:31.670
But what makes them different is who their target audience is rather than

28
00:01:31.671 --> 00:01:35.330
targeting people in continuing education or people who are in their twenties.

29
00:01:35.480 --> 00:01:40.400
They're targeting children literally like six years old is where they start up

30
00:01:40.401 --> 00:01:44.510
to age 18 and they make some pretty astounding claims.

31
00:01:44.900 --> 00:01:47.600
Here's one of their ads right here to give you an idea of the type of

32
00:01:47.601 --> 00:01:48.680
advertising they do.

33
00:01:48.681 --> 00:01:51.830
They say space technology is the number one future career for kids.

34
00:01:51.831 --> 00:01:55.760
Your kid can learn to code a spaceship in just 46 minutes,

35
00:01:56.980 --> 00:02:00.590
start free coding and a space tech trial. Uh, okay. First of all, it's not free.

36
00:02:00.591 --> 00:02:01.820
It's about $200 a month.

37
00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:06.410
And obviously it's ridiculous that someone can code a spaceship in 46 minutes,

38
00:02:06.470 --> 00:02:07.220
right?

39
00:02:07.220 --> 00:02:11.180
But they continue with this idea basically telling you that actually the fact

40
00:02:11.181 --> 00:02:14.990
that your kid's so young doesn't mean that they're hindered from learning things

41
00:02:14.991 --> 00:02:18.020
like AI and ML. It actually means they may learn it faster.

42
00:02:18.080 --> 00:02:20.840
And you can see that in their curriculum where they show you how much your kid's

43
00:02:20.841 --> 00:02:23.510
going to be learning. And they tell you things like that,

44
00:02:23.511 --> 00:02:26.840
your kid will get a game developer certificate before they've been through eight

45
00:02:26.841 --> 00:02:31.610
classes of coding. I have your six year old going through seven classes.

46
00:02:31.611 --> 00:02:35.030
And all of a sudden he's coding up candy crush and league of legends.

47
00:02:35.090 --> 00:02:39.590
And this has led many people to criticize their overly simplified and almost

48
00:02:40.250 --> 00:02:40.881
dreamlike promises.

49
00:02:40.881 --> 00:02:44.270
They're making the parents that their kid's going to be the next bill Gates and

50
00:02:44.271 --> 00:02:46.430
ads like this reinforced the point.

51
00:02:46.640 --> 00:02:51.140
They're saying that you can make a $1.2 million salary

52
00:02:51.500 --> 00:02:56.450
at age 13. I mean talk about selling parents, a dream you're saying,

53
00:02:56.451 --> 00:03:01.060
Hey, pay us $200 a month. And your can potentially be working at Google.

54
00:03:01.061 --> 00:03:05.920
It's obviously Google's campus and be making a $1.2 million

55
00:03:05.980 --> 00:03:06.730
salary.

56
00:03:06.730 --> 00:03:11.230
And this is where a lot of the criticism is coming from because not only did

57
00:03:11.231 --> 00:03:13.420
they suggest this as a possibility,

58
00:03:13.630 --> 00:03:17.650
they actually said that one of their students had achieved this meat Wolf.

59
00:03:18.130 --> 00:03:20.860
Guppta an example that white hat Jr was using.

60
00:03:21.220 --> 00:03:25.360
Apparently he learned AI to get a $1.2 million job.

61
00:03:25.390 --> 00:03:26.950
And he's 13 at the time when he did it.

62
00:03:27.280 --> 00:03:31.750
Now here's where the cracks first start to appear because later on in different

63
00:03:31.751 --> 00:03:35.980
ads, their story started to change. Because over here we have Wolf,

64
00:03:36.520 --> 00:03:39.850
Guppta learning computers at age nine. So he,

65
00:03:40.060 --> 00:03:44.890
he actually learned it quicker in the new ad. And he's making 150 crores,

66
00:03:45.250 --> 00:03:48.670
which is actually not just $1.2 million.

67
00:03:48.850 --> 00:03:53.440
It's actually $20 million. So he's younger and making way more money.

68
00:03:54.040 --> 00:03:56.500
And here in another ad, the story changes again.

69
00:03:57.310 --> 00:03:59.110
We're nine-year-old Ryan.

70
00:03:59.470 --> 00:04:04.210
We changed it from Wolf goop D learn computers to earn 150 crores from

71
00:04:04.211 --> 00:04:07.090
Google video while other kids at his age were surfing YouTube videos.

72
00:04:07.510 --> 00:04:11.410
So here they are promoting a story that appears to be false.

73
00:04:11.440 --> 00:04:14.410
And there's no disclaimer about, Hey, this is a fictional story.

74
00:04:14.410 --> 00:04:18.460
It's aspirational, whatever nothing they're saying, this is one of our students.

75
00:04:18.520 --> 00:04:23.110
This really happened. Now, this is where our first critic gets involved.

76
00:04:23.440 --> 00:04:27.790
Prod deep. Poonja started to call them out for this predatory behavior.

77
00:04:27.791 --> 00:04:30.580
And he said, look, you guys are false advertising to parents.

78
00:04:30.790 --> 00:04:33.520
You're not telling the truth about this Wolf, goop to character.

79
00:04:33.730 --> 00:04:37.510
A lot of your stories are fake and he starts publishing a bunch of videos about

80
00:04:37.511 --> 00:04:40.840
it. The problem with that white hat junior doesn't like that.

81
00:04:40.841 --> 00:04:42.130
They don't want negative press.

82
00:04:42.160 --> 00:04:46.390
So what do they do rather than engaging with the criticism and saying, look,

83
00:04:46.391 --> 00:04:48.340
guys, we messed up. We lied.

84
00:04:49.060 --> 00:04:53.200
Instead they start copyright striking the man. Here's a, this guy,

85
00:04:53.201 --> 00:04:56.650
he got five copyright strikes in a row from white hat Jr.

86
00:04:56.651 --> 00:05:00.100
And the company that bought them out. Now they copyright strike this guy.

87
00:05:00.101 --> 00:05:03.460
So many times that he's had to create three different YouTube channels where he

88
00:05:03.461 --> 00:05:07.450
keeps uploading criticisms of white hat Jr. Now, already,

89
00:05:07.451 --> 00:05:09.040
this looks really bad for white hat Jr.

90
00:05:09.041 --> 00:05:11.860
Who claims that they're open to criticism, right?

91
00:05:11.920 --> 00:05:13.900
Remember that at the beginning of the video,

92
00:05:14.080 --> 00:05:16.900
keep giving us feedback to improve legitimate,

93
00:05:16.901 --> 00:05:21.520
honest fact-based criticism is truly welcome. So what's the problem. Well,

94
00:05:21.550 --> 00:05:25.990
they claimed that our critic here is lying and making illegal breaches.

95
00:05:26.020 --> 00:05:29.650
That damage real life. Now, what are they talking about? Well, to find out,

96
00:05:29.651 --> 00:05:33.100
let's go to the lawsuit. First thing to know about this lawsuit.

97
00:05:33.160 --> 00:05:35.440
It's 820 pages long.

98
00:05:35.620 --> 00:05:38.410
The second thing you should know about it is in the lawsuit.

99
00:05:38.440 --> 00:05:42.790
They admit that a lot of the criticism is true. This Wolf goop,

100
00:05:42.910 --> 00:05:47.530
that character doesn't exist. It was a lie. According to white hat Jr.

101
00:05:47.560 --> 00:05:49.540
Themselves, their own lawsuit.

102
00:05:50.140 --> 00:05:54.280
It was an imaginary child who the plaintiffs christened Wolf Gupta.

103
00:05:54.520 --> 00:05:58.870
So it's imaginary. It didn't happen. But nowhere in that thing, did it say it?

104
00:05:58.880 --> 00:06:00.320
They were saying, Hey, we got the student.

105
00:06:00.650 --> 00:06:04.100
He made millions of dollars with our classes. Oh, but actually he doesn't exist.

106
00:06:04.101 --> 00:06:06.980
Didn't you guys know is imaginary. Didn't you didn't you know that? No,

107
00:06:06.981 --> 00:06:11.060
nobody knew it. So they admit in the lawsuit that that is true.

108
00:06:11.330 --> 00:06:16.070
But then call out our guy for saying that plaintiff one had murdered Wolf.

109
00:06:16.430 --> 00:06:18.740
Gooped up when they withdrew their advertisements,

110
00:06:18.770 --> 00:06:22.790
they say the defendant's posts quickly turned sinister subsequent to the

111
00:06:22.791 --> 00:06:25.910
withdrawal of the advertisements to this. I have to say, obviously,

112
00:06:26.150 --> 00:06:29.690
this is a joke when you say, Oh yeah, they murdered Wolf. Gooped up.

113
00:06:29.720 --> 00:06:32.720
That's obviously a joke that the guy's making.

114
00:06:32.930 --> 00:06:36.470
Nobody's going to construe that as literally they killed a kid.

115
00:06:36.680 --> 00:06:39.350
So that's a super bad faith interpretation.

116
00:06:39.590 --> 00:06:42.920
Obviously he's just being tongue and cheek with the fact that suddenly this

117
00:06:42.921 --> 00:06:46.760
mysterious kid, who's your poster child of success, just mysteriously,

118
00:06:46.761 --> 00:06:49.130
vanishes these saying they murdered him. It's a joke.

119
00:06:49.190 --> 00:06:53.450
But then the other giant allegation here is that the defendant hacked into their

120
00:06:53.451 --> 00:06:55.430
Slack communications things. They do,

121
00:06:55.431 --> 00:06:59.510
you see that even hack into plaintiff number two's internal business

122
00:06:59.511 --> 00:07:00.800
communications platform.

123
00:07:00.830 --> 00:07:04.550
And this is actually where things become pretty complicated and things get kind

124
00:07:04.551 --> 00:07:06.140
of muddy because it's true.

125
00:07:06.141 --> 00:07:10.010
That pretty Poonja published to his Twitter and his YouTube channel,

126
00:07:10.160 --> 00:07:13.100
multiple Slack communications from this company.

127
00:07:13.370 --> 00:07:15.350
But what's unclear is how he got them.

128
00:07:15.680 --> 00:07:18.920
Some people have said that they accidentally left their Slack public.

129
00:07:18.980 --> 00:07:23.930
Some people have said that he obtained a CEO password and some people have

130
00:07:23.931 --> 00:07:27.140
said it was a whistleblower that released this to the public.

131
00:07:27.141 --> 00:07:31.850
It's not clear how he got it. In my opinion, obviously hacking, is it okay?

132
00:07:32.060 --> 00:07:36.260
But if it's a whistleblower that came to him and released these images to him,

133
00:07:36.530 --> 00:07:40.370
I think that's a different thing altogether to release those into the public.

134
00:07:40.370 --> 00:07:42.950
If they're a public interest and after reading them,

135
00:07:42.980 --> 00:07:44.960
I definitely think they are.

136
00:07:44.961 --> 00:07:48.470
I'm not saying that any ends justify the means here of how you get them.

137
00:07:48.920 --> 00:07:50.540
But now that they're out in the public,

138
00:07:50.570 --> 00:07:53.780
it's interesting that the fact that they're calling them out for hacking their

139
00:07:53.781 --> 00:07:55.940
platform and releasing them into the public domain,

140
00:07:56.240 --> 00:08:00.950
they're almost confirming that these leaks are indeed real and valid

141
00:08:01.100 --> 00:08:03.230
because obviously if they were fake, they would say, Oh,

142
00:08:03.231 --> 00:08:05.570
he photo-shopped these false things. Instead,

143
00:08:05.571 --> 00:08:09.440
their argument is he took confidential communications and publish them.

144
00:08:09.500 --> 00:08:12.530
Which again, I'm not defending it because we don't know how he got those.

145
00:08:12.531 --> 00:08:16.940
But what the Slack communications reveal now that they're in the public is

146
00:08:16.970 --> 00:08:21.140
pretty damning. I'm going to have to sensor out a lot here, just FYI.

147
00:08:21.141 --> 00:08:23.960
So if you see a blurt, it's because I'm trying to protect, you know,

148
00:08:23.961 --> 00:08:25.520
employee information here.

149
00:08:25.970 --> 00:08:30.290
But basically we see a series of screenshots of employees seeming to be

150
00:08:30.291 --> 00:08:33.890
reporting, uh, criticisms from various Twitter accounts,

151
00:08:34.070 --> 00:08:35.360
from all sorts of things,

152
00:08:35.720 --> 00:08:38.990
contradicting their idea that they're open to criticism. And it's only,

153
00:08:38.991 --> 00:08:39.231
you know,

154
00:08:39.231 --> 00:08:42.260
bad faith criticism that they don't like because they're just reporting

155
00:08:42.261 --> 00:08:43.040
everything.

156
00:08:43.040 --> 00:08:47.360
They even report a depressed employee who says exploitation of teachers and

157
00:08:47.361 --> 00:08:50.330
employees at work and white hat, junior 15 hours working every day,

158
00:08:50.331 --> 00:08:52.790
seven days a week, team leader warranted to terminate.

159
00:08:52.791 --> 00:08:57.270
If raised voice feels frustrated, depressed, the internal Slack says,

160
00:08:57.271 --> 00:08:58.470
can we report the tweet?

161
00:08:58.471 --> 00:09:01.920
Also another one is talking about a negative video and they say, don't reply,

162
00:09:01.950 --> 00:09:05.340
just get the video down. So they don't want to engage with criticism.

163
00:09:05.370 --> 00:09:08.820
They're not interested in that. They just want to censor voices.

164
00:09:09.000 --> 00:09:11.880
But worst of all, I think is this communication,

165
00:09:12.150 --> 00:09:15.360
which came from their C E O okay.

166
00:09:15.570 --> 00:09:20.070
Somebody raised a concern and they posted to a chat where a parent or some kind

167
00:09:20.071 --> 00:09:24.990
of like would be client is asking about an ad that was published where a

168
00:09:24.991 --> 00:09:29.220
13 year old is becoming the CEO of a face detecting app. And they're saying,

169
00:09:29.221 --> 00:09:32.520
one of my students is interested in to see the app made by that student.

170
00:09:32.760 --> 00:09:33.840
Any ideas, how to check that.

171
00:09:33.841 --> 00:09:36.450
So they're saying where's this app that you claim was made by one of your

172
00:09:36.451 --> 00:09:40.020
students and the CEO of white hat Jr. Is saying,

173
00:09:40.050 --> 00:09:44.630
be to create that app now, which is so disgusting,

174
00:09:44.810 --> 00:09:47.510
are you really internalize that they've advertised this thing?

175
00:09:47.920 --> 00:09:50.750
They've created this whole narrative that this was done by a kid.

176
00:09:50.780 --> 00:09:54.680
It can be done by your kid. You should pay us $200 a month because you know,

177
00:09:54.970 --> 00:09:58.790
this is reasonable expectations or at least this is what can be expected.

178
00:09:59.690 --> 00:10:02.390
And this guy is saying that when somebody asks for proof,

179
00:10:02.630 --> 00:10:05.270
he seems to be implying at once that it doesn't exist.

180
00:10:05.480 --> 00:10:09.110
And that if it was to exist, it has to be coded by a professional engineer,

181
00:10:10.070 --> 00:10:13.520
to which one of their employees responds that a person can create and send it as

182
00:10:13.521 --> 00:10:16.670
promised. And they asked, do you want me to another employee response?

183
00:10:16.700 --> 00:10:17.750
I can create the app.

184
00:10:17.840 --> 00:10:22.430
I can not get a 13 year old to create the company around it. At least not now,

185
00:10:22.670 --> 00:10:24.590
which of course not.

186
00:10:24.740 --> 00:10:29.120
And so they're saying internally that they know they can't get a 13 year old to

187
00:10:29.121 --> 00:10:32.030
do this. And this CEO responds that we will,

188
00:10:32.750 --> 00:10:37.220
this is so bad and demonstrates a pattern of behavior.

189
00:10:37.370 --> 00:10:41.510
So Wolf gooped up was not the only one that they did this with it.

190
00:10:41.511 --> 00:10:46.160
Wasn't just one offhand thing, multiple examples they use about,

191
00:10:46.340 --> 00:10:49.970
Oh, these kids are coding these crazy apps and your kids can too,

192
00:10:50.210 --> 00:10:53.210
they are fabricating these narratives, this, this weird thing, right?

193
00:10:53.210 --> 00:10:55.640
Because in the lawsuit, the Slack channel,

194
00:10:55.641 --> 00:10:59.360
like the Slack channel discussion is kind of a poison chalice for white hat, Jr.

195
00:10:59.480 --> 00:11:03.410
Because on the one hand they have a point ponia should not have released private

196
00:11:03.411 --> 00:11:05.660
communications. You know, it depends how he got them.

197
00:11:05.690 --> 00:11:08.630
If he got them through a whistleblower, then he didn't hack them. I mean,

198
00:11:08.631 --> 00:11:10.760
that's just not true. Uh, it just depends.

199
00:11:11.300 --> 00:11:15.350
But the fact that they admit that these Slack communications exist and they seem

200
00:11:15.351 --> 00:11:20.240
to be verifying that they are real is an even worse look for the company

201
00:11:20.241 --> 00:11:23.540
than anything that they've admitted publicly. So that's where the story is now.

202
00:11:24.170 --> 00:11:28.970
Um, it's not believable that white hat Jr is only going after people who are,

203
00:11:29.150 --> 00:11:30.350
you know, being unfair to them.

204
00:11:30.560 --> 00:11:33.260
They are silencing all criticism that comes their way.

205
00:11:33.261 --> 00:11:36.020
It's very clear from the messages that the reporting,

206
00:11:36.021 --> 00:11:39.830
anything and everything that can be construed as criticism at all.

207
00:11:39.980 --> 00:11:42.650
You can be sure that they'll report this video, the report,

208
00:11:42.680 --> 00:11:44.840
any video that talks about them. And frankly,

209
00:11:44.841 --> 00:11:49.040
that's the part that bothers me the most because in order to root out corruption

210
00:11:49.041 --> 00:11:52.070
scams, to tell the frauds from the people who are honest,

211
00:11:52.190 --> 00:11:56.140
you have to that criticism, you have to have the open exchange,

212
00:11:56.170 --> 00:12:00.430
even when it's sort of intense and it can be loaded with some,

213
00:12:00.431 --> 00:12:03.310
a pretty heavy language. You have to have it.

214
00:12:03.610 --> 00:12:06.400
You have to have it for the people who are buying into this stuff.

215
00:12:06.610 --> 00:12:07.840
This is a multi,

216
00:12:08.230 --> 00:12:12.250
multi multi-million dollar company and it needs to be exposed to criticism,

217
00:12:12.610 --> 00:12:14.680
perceive it holds up. And right now they're not doing that.

218
00:12:14.740 --> 00:12:18.520
My hope is as always that the truth comes out. Thanks for watching.

219
00:12:18.550 --> 00:12:22.330
And we may do a follow-up on this. As more information comes out, see you next.
