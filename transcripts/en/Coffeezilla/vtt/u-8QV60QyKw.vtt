00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:03.000
<v 0>Ladies and gentlemen, this is an update to the Whitehead Jr. Story.</v>

2
00:00:03.001 --> 00:00:05.550
If you haven't seen it already, you can go watch it here. Uh,

3
00:00:05.610 --> 00:00:10.410
basically to summarize an ed tech camp is using thuggish tactics to take down

4
00:00:10.470 --> 00:00:15.240
any criticism they deem in any way, negative of them. At the same time,

5
00:00:15.241 --> 00:00:18.480
they try to pretend that they're very accepting of criticism.

6
00:00:18.481 --> 00:00:21.540
I showed you guys that in the last video, of course, it's colloquially known.

7
00:00:21.541 --> 00:00:25.350
Even I was getting comments that they take down stuff. They love to do it.

8
00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:29.970
But what isn't known is exactly how extensive this is, right?

9
00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:31.050
So I'm here to tell you today,

10
00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:34.290
you remember those Slack conversations from last time that were leaked. Well,

11
00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:37.440
someone went through them and catalog all the links.

12
00:00:37.441 --> 00:00:39.900
They were following reporting, monitoring,

13
00:00:39.901 --> 00:00:43.500
trying to get taken down and they actually categorized it in a gigantic

14
00:00:43.501 --> 00:00:44.730
spreadsheet. Okay.

15
00:00:44.970 --> 00:00:47.550
I'm not going to be sharing it on screen because it contains private

16
00:00:47.551 --> 00:00:48.120
information.

17
00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:50.940
And I don't want to give them any false reason to take down this video.

18
00:00:50.941 --> 00:00:53.400
So I'm not going to be sharing that, but if you want to find it online,

19
00:00:53.401 --> 00:00:54.660
you can pretty easily find it.

20
00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:59.250
But the point is I went and I chased down all these links and I checked,

21
00:00:59.400 --> 00:01:02.490
how many of them did they successfully delete their whole case?

22
00:01:02.491 --> 00:01:07.260
Remember is that they're only suing two of their critics for millions of dollars

23
00:01:07.440 --> 00:01:09.270
because they lied. They don't,

24
00:01:09.300 --> 00:01:12.900
they don't mind real criticism from real customers. That's what they say, right?

25
00:01:13.410 --> 00:01:18.330
Here's what we find in actuality, just in the month of October,

26
00:01:18.331 --> 00:01:21.840
I made it October. So it's easy to project out for the year.

27
00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:25.350
They removed 109 posts.

28
00:01:25.650 --> 00:01:28.320
They removed 51 YouTube videos,

29
00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:33.210
51 they're moved 27, Twitter posts, 11 Facebook posts,

30
00:01:33.300 --> 00:01:34.800
15 LinkedIn posts,

31
00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:39.780
three Instagram posts and two posts from the most unlikely source of all

32
00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:41.730
nine gag. Yes, that's right.

33
00:01:42.120 --> 00:01:46.470
Whitehead junior is even monitoring nine gagged for offensive comments.

34
00:01:46.650 --> 00:01:48.310
And they go ahead and get those removed here.

35
00:01:48.311 --> 00:01:51.900
Here are the comments and question. Someone was making fun of one of their, uh,

36
00:01:52.050 --> 00:01:54.870
you know, success stories. That was a big joke. Yeah.

37
00:01:54.930 --> 00:01:57.990
They don't take too kindly to that. They get that stuff removed. And look,

38
00:01:57.991 --> 00:02:00.630
you might be asking yourself, well, Stephen, how do you know that this is,

39
00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:04.410
this is a realist. How do you know that they really are taking them down? Well,

40
00:02:04.411 --> 00:02:07.290
the reason we know these are real is that a lot of them are,

41
00:02:07.350 --> 00:02:11.370
especially the YouTube videos in particular are being manually taken down with

42
00:02:11.371 --> 00:02:12.720
copyright strikes, right?

43
00:02:12.930 --> 00:02:16.290
Even when they don't have reasons to take down content,

44
00:02:16.291 --> 00:02:17.610
they'll take it down anyways. See,

45
00:02:17.640 --> 00:02:21.930
this is one of the comments for one of these YouTubers where they say user has

46
00:02:21.931 --> 00:02:25.920
nowhere use the white hat, junior logo or any copyrighted content in the video.

47
00:02:26.010 --> 00:02:28.080
So you can't copyright strike it because that's how they're getting all these

48
00:02:28.081 --> 00:02:28.800
videos done.

49
00:02:28.800 --> 00:02:31.980
There's no legal point with us to dispute with YouTube on this video.

50
00:02:32.730 --> 00:02:34.740
Trademark certificate might help us to take it down.

51
00:02:34.950 --> 00:02:37.920
But when you go to the video, do you see taken down by a trademark? No.

52
00:02:38.220 --> 00:02:41.940
We see it's taken down by a copyright claim from the same company that's taking

53
00:02:41.941 --> 00:02:44.970
all of these white hat, junior things down. It's one of their, uh, corporations,

54
00:02:44.971 --> 00:02:49.200
I guess they've even gone so far as to get some YouTube accounts banned the

55
00:02:49.201 --> 00:02:53.100
account that posted it all of a sudden gone. Isn't that a coincidence? I mean,

56
00:02:53.101 --> 00:02:57.510
and can we address the nine cat thing, guys? Let me say, look,

57
00:02:57.540 --> 00:03:01.630
there are a few points in life where you got to stop yourself. Right?

58
00:03:01.660 --> 00:03:02.530
We talked about this.

59
00:03:02.531 --> 00:03:05.470
When the guy tried to escape from the FBI with a C scooter, I told you guys,

60
00:03:05.471 --> 00:03:07.870
if you ever find yourself on a C scooter, you know,

61
00:03:07.871 --> 00:03:11.170
you've made a series of poor life decisions. You don't just end up on a C skirt.

62
00:03:11.200 --> 00:03:12.160
The same is true here.

63
00:03:12.370 --> 00:03:15.820
If you find yourself monitoring and censoring posts on nine gag,

64
00:03:16.090 --> 00:03:18.820
which is the platform people go to when they haven't heard of Reddit yet,

65
00:03:18.821 --> 00:03:22.180
and they're stuck in 2009, when you find yourself doing that,

66
00:03:22.780 --> 00:03:24.940
you've taken some wrong turns.

67
00:03:25.300 --> 00:03:27.880
And what I want to say to the leadership of white hat junior,

68
00:03:27.881 --> 00:03:29.350
if I could speak to them for a second,

69
00:03:29.650 --> 00:03:33.880
you guys are playing the victim and it's not working. It's clearly not working.

70
00:03:33.881 --> 00:03:36.040
These lawsuits have hugely backfired on you.

71
00:03:36.050 --> 00:03:39.220
People are now paying even more attention to the topic than they were before.

72
00:03:39.730 --> 00:03:43.090
And you're embarrassing yourselves because look at this, look at this.

73
00:03:43.091 --> 00:03:45.310
This is from the same post from the CEO where he tries to play.

74
00:03:45.311 --> 00:03:49.390
The victim news cycles turned against us because negative stories are far more

75
00:03:49.391 --> 00:03:53.620
sensational than the truth. No, dude, the truth is, look,

76
00:03:54.010 --> 00:03:57.190
I didn't have to sensationalize this. You sensationalized it.

77
00:03:57.250 --> 00:04:01.180
The fact that 109 critical posts were removed in October.

78
00:04:01.270 --> 00:04:05.110
That's already a sensational fact and you created the negativity for yourself.

79
00:04:05.260 --> 00:04:08.980
Instead. You're trying to pretend like, Oh, we didn't want to go to court,

80
00:04:09.010 --> 00:04:13.480
but you sued. Oh, false unethical attacks. What's false.

81
00:04:13.510 --> 00:04:17.500
One of the main criticism that Wolf goop to is a false imaginary character.

82
00:04:17.770 --> 00:04:21.880
You in your lawsuit admitted is true. So you're suing them,

83
00:04:22.570 --> 00:04:25.900
but they're right about their main critical points. So look again,

84
00:04:25.901 --> 00:04:28.210
speaking to the leadership of white hat junior,

85
00:04:28.240 --> 00:04:31.030
you guys have to take a different path. This isn't going to work for you,

86
00:04:31.031 --> 00:04:34.360
this constant censorship. Instead he got to drop the lawsuit,

87
00:04:34.370 --> 00:04:37.870
stop the censorship, admit to messing up and call it a day.

88
00:04:37.990 --> 00:04:40.090
But this isn't going to work. What I'm seeing right here,

89
00:04:40.300 --> 00:04:41.740
taking down a hundred posts a month.

90
00:04:41.770 --> 00:04:44.830
How long do you think you can keep doing that until there's a thousand negative

91
00:04:44.831 --> 00:04:48.040
posts a month? I mean, if there's one thing the internet hates,

92
00:04:48.280 --> 00:04:51.520
it's somebody trying to shut down the internet and that's exactly what you guys

93
00:04:51.521 --> 00:04:54.490
are doing here. No, one's gonna stand for it. And um, yeah,

94
00:04:54.520 --> 00:04:56.650
I just wanted to Chronicle this. Uh,

95
00:04:57.070 --> 00:04:59.470
I've got to just stop this video before it gets too out of hand.

96
00:04:59.471 --> 00:05:02.320
I made my point. So I don't know how long this video is going to be up.

97
00:05:02.321 --> 00:05:05.860
So if you see it, share it, uh, thanks for watching and I'll see you next time.

98
00:05:06.180 --> 00:05:10.650
<v 1>And don't forget to smash light and subscribe. Thank you.</v>
