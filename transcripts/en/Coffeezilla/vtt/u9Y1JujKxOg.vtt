00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:01.320
<v 0>Grant. Thanks for coming in, buddy.</v>

2
00:00:01.321 --> 00:00:04.770
I know you don't believe in psychiatrists and that's okay because I'm not a

3
00:00:04.771 --> 00:00:08.400
psychiatrist, so don't worry. Don't get so defensive. Okay.

4
00:00:08.401 --> 00:00:11.700
Put your hands down grant. Cause you know what you've been up to, you know,

5
00:00:11.701 --> 00:00:13.230
you've been acting very strange.

6
00:00:13.260 --> 00:00:15.420
Your friends have been telling me you've been acting different ever since the

7
00:00:15.421 --> 00:00:18.600
pandemic and grant. Let's just, let's just talk about it, right?

8
00:00:18.601 --> 00:00:23.370
It's time for an intervention. Act like a vote.

9
00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:24.563
A.

10
00:00:24.890 --> 00:00:28.340
<v 1>What's next is insane.</v>

11
00:00:30.140 --> 00:00:30.711
Oh yeah.

12
00:00:30.711 --> 00:00:35.180
You're going to see a whole new side of uncle G

13
00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:39.110
I'm talking crazy

14
00:00:41.240 --> 00:00:45.290
or you ready? Can you handle it?

15
00:00:47.570 --> 00:00:51.320
Will you love me? Will you hate me?

16
00:01:00.830 --> 00:01:02.090
<v 0>Woo, indeed. Grant.</v>

17
00:01:02.210 --> 00:01:05.840
Now some of your friends think it's just because you're losing a lot of money

18
00:01:05.841 --> 00:01:09.770
during the pandemic now on the rumors of my bankruptcy, that is soon to happen.

19
00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:13.640
Yes, it's true. Okay. I'm losing the plane, the condo,

20
00:01:13.670 --> 00:01:15.920
we all know you're stressed grant and you know,

21
00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:18.440
maybe it's time to like meditate or something,

22
00:01:18.441 --> 00:01:22.850
but you got to stop posting to social media, buddy. I don't need a lecture.

23
00:01:23.210 --> 00:01:26.810
My grown got wrong, man. Oh, it was like he finally speaks. Huh?

24
00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:29.630
Well really you're so grown. Explain that.

25
00:01:45.020 --> 00:01:45.853
<v 1>[Inaudible].</v>

26
00:01:46.400 --> 00:01:49.880
<v 0>Yeah, I know I'm speechless to grant, uh,</v>

27
00:01:49.910 --> 00:01:52.160
and that's not even all there is for this next clip.

28
00:01:52.190 --> 00:01:54.650
I'm actually going to be a wearing some safety protection.

29
00:01:55.040 --> 00:01:57.320
This is for my safety, not for yours.

30
00:02:13.790 --> 00:02:14.623
<v 1>Okay.</v>

31
00:02:15.110 --> 00:02:16.130
<v 0>Grant, when you see that video of yourself,</v>

32
00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:20.840
do you see a man who is saying Kevin, the next day,

33
00:02:21.470 --> 00:02:25.400
the next day nurse to lose, you can come in, come in here, get in here

34
00:02:26.960 --> 00:02:31.040
and losing brands, patient record grant Cardone.

35
00:02:31.070 --> 00:02:35.810
I was unable to get the patient responsive for the rest of the session.

36
00:02:35.960 --> 00:02:40.040
He would only shout cryptically, have a 10 X day, but with a few more sessions,

37
00:02:40.041 --> 00:02:42.770
I do think that he may make some progress,

38
00:02:43.040 --> 00:02:47.150
but notice that as soon as he left, he did post another tick tock,

39
00:02:47.330 --> 00:02:51.380
which is deeply concerning follow up next week.

40
00:03:05.660 --> 00:03:05.660
[inaudible].
