00:00:00.240 --> 00:00:04.620
<v 0>I'm making this video to respond to some ordinary gamers who shouted this out</v>

2
00:00:04.621 --> 00:00:07.800
guys, we're on the come up. Okay. We got some fake channel out in,

3
00:00:07.950 --> 00:00:11.790
is out some ordinary gamers is like two mil subs, baby.

4
00:00:12.150 --> 00:00:13.980
And he gave us some love.

5
00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:17.520
So I wanted to respond to him because he had some interesting points.

6
00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:22.620
And I want to get to that because I have a lot to say about it. He said,

7
00:00:22.621 --> 00:00:26.430
look, he made a video. YouTube is promoting scams. And in his video, he's like,

8
00:00:26.431 --> 00:00:28.620
Hey, there policies against promoting scams,

9
00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:32.700
but it seems like YouTube is promoting them anyway. And this is my message.

10
00:00:32.701 --> 00:00:36.270
I want to share with some ordinary gamers right here. Wait,

11
00:00:36.330 --> 00:00:39.660
YouTube is promoting. Scams always has been.

12
00:00:39.990 --> 00:00:42.540
And we're going to get into some examples into this video,

13
00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:46.260
into some favoritism for advertisers over creators. I mean,

14
00:00:46.261 --> 00:00:49.950
creators think where the lifeblood of this, uh, this platform, but we're not.

15
00:00:50.790 --> 00:00:54.660
It's the advertisers and they get crazy preferential treatment.

16
00:00:54.690 --> 00:00:56.820
Even the scammy ones we'll get into that.

17
00:00:56.821 --> 00:01:00.720
But first let's go back to the office so we can talk about, um, or shout out.

18
00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:03.510
Welcome back here. We have Moodle har shouting us out here.

19
00:01:04.250 --> 00:01:07.670
<v 1>Let's go to my, one of my favorite channels, which is coffee's Dilla. You may.</v>

20
00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:14.660
<v 0>Don't worry guys. I won't let it go to my head.</v>

21
00:01:15.380 --> 00:01:18.530
<v 1>I remember this channel from the time we covered the YouTube doxing situation</v>

22
00:01:18.531 --> 00:01:20.600
regarding a fellow brethren of mine, friend black.

23
00:01:21.350 --> 00:01:24.320
<v 0>The trend. Black's great. Make sure you go subscribe to his channel programmer.</v>

24
00:01:24.650 --> 00:01:28.550
<v 1>Well, coffee's Illa somebody that focuses on a lot of these MLM scam,</v>

25
00:01:28.790 --> 00:01:32.930
CS drape D day trading scams. And, uh, he, he's a,

26
00:01:32.931 --> 00:01:37.730
he's a pretty solid content creator. Give him a chance. I, I feel like, um.

27
00:01:38.150 --> 00:01:41.210
<v 0>This is too much. It's like watching yourself, get a compliment. It's slow,</v>

28
00:01:41.211 --> 00:01:45.050
cringy a little bit. But anyway, the point is I just, I wanted to say,

29
00:01:45.051 --> 00:01:45.830
thank you.

30
00:01:45.830 --> 00:01:50.720
I got a subscriber bump when he posted this a lot of love

31
00:01:50.721 --> 00:01:54.020
from his community. So thank you very much.

32
00:01:54.320 --> 00:01:56.960
I think we have probably have a lot of audience overlap.

33
00:01:57.230 --> 00:02:01.880
He sometimes talks about scam stuff like this in the community wrongs that need

34
00:02:01.881 --> 00:02:06.740
to be righted. But I wanted to say his point, which is basically,

35
00:02:06.950 --> 00:02:10.880
uh, YouTube. Doesn't follow their own policies on scams.

36
00:02:10.881 --> 00:02:13.640
Like how can these scams be allowed?

37
00:02:13.880 --> 00:02:16.070
It seems like they're playing favorites here.

38
00:02:16.280 --> 00:02:18.650
<v 1>The fact that we get striked for that kind of odd,</v>

39
00:02:18.830 --> 00:02:21.620
I've literally showed you all these pyramid schemes.

40
00:02:21.650 --> 00:02:23.540
They all fall under the scam section,

41
00:02:23.690 --> 00:02:26.480
but how much do you think they're going to get enforced by YouTube? None.

42
00:02:26.810 --> 00:02:29.420
Probably not much at all. Ladies and gentlemen,

43
00:02:29.421 --> 00:02:31.010
this video is already long enough. I want it.

44
00:02:31.670 --> 00:02:33.200
<v 0>Anyway. That's the main point he makes.</v>

45
00:02:33.201 --> 00:02:37.400
And I wanted to add to that because a lot of you guys have not seen this clip.

46
00:02:37.430 --> 00:02:39.230
I think I'm the only person on the internet.

47
00:02:39.380 --> 00:02:42.200
That's seen it because otherwise all of you would be talking about it.

48
00:02:42.710 --> 00:02:46.130
We actually have definitive testimony from an advertiser about the,

49
00:02:46.370 --> 00:02:48.920
about the favoritism that they get. Look at this.

50
00:02:49.070 --> 00:02:52.580
This is a clip from a grant Cardone podcast with Ty Lopez.

51
00:02:52.640 --> 00:02:56.480
Ty Lopez at one point was one of the biggest advertisers on the platform.

52
00:02:56.510 --> 00:02:58.460
That was a non-branded advertiser.

53
00:02:58.730 --> 00:03:02.830
And he's to tell us just the kind of preferential treatment they get. Yeah.

54
00:03:02.940 --> 00:03:05.670
<v 2>But I I'm almost the biggest YouTube advertiser,</v>

55
00:03:05.730 --> 00:03:09.210
maybe Coca Cola or brand. Not that big.

56
00:03:10.050 --> 00:03:15.040
That's what Google tells me of non huge brands went and compared

57
00:03:15.330 --> 00:03:17.220
himself to Coca-Cola. He can't do that. Well, I'll tell you this.

58
00:03:17.221 --> 00:03:19.080
Google sends two people to my house.

59
00:03:19.140 --> 00:03:22.170
I got two or four reps that flight out for San Francisco. Yeah.

60
00:03:22.890 --> 00:03:27.000
<v 0>Uh, excuse me. You have two to four reps, dude. Hey,</v>

61
00:03:27.060 --> 00:03:31.440
I want attention all you tubers. Okay. Attention.

62
00:03:31.860 --> 00:03:32.850
All you tubers.

63
00:03:33.450 --> 00:03:38.100
How many of you guys have had YouTube fly out reps to your

64
00:03:38.101 --> 00:03:40.770
house to make sure that everything's okay. Ty,

65
00:03:40.771 --> 00:03:43.830
you're going to keep spending with us. Right? What can we do for you tie?

66
00:03:43.890 --> 00:03:47.130
I mean, I don't know any other YouTube besides maybe,

67
00:03:47.280 --> 00:03:51.840
maybe even Klein that gets this kind of love from the boys upstairs.

68
00:03:52.080 --> 00:03:55.920
Okay. Because we just don't the rest of us creators.

69
00:03:55.950 --> 00:04:00.090
You're lucky if you have a rep that will email you on the full moon of every

70
00:04:00.091 --> 00:04:03.960
month. I mean, most of us don't even have that. I had a rep once,

71
00:04:03.961 --> 00:04:07.290
Hey guess where they are nowhere to be found. They left the company.

72
00:04:07.470 --> 00:04:11.310
I had contact for like three days with Google and then they're like, Hey,

73
00:04:11.430 --> 00:04:13.620
we really value you, but we're never going to respond again.

74
00:04:13.890 --> 00:04:16.380
That's the normal creator experience.

75
00:04:16.410 --> 00:04:19.920
You really don't have any contact with him. And if you do, it's periodic,

76
00:04:19.950 --> 00:04:24.780
it's like a telegram levels of contact. [inaudible] it's like terrible.

77
00:04:24.840 --> 00:04:27.930
Nobody that I've ever seen has this level of access,

78
00:04:27.931 --> 00:04:29.820
but that's what advertisers get.

79
00:04:30.570 --> 00:04:34.500
<v 2>So, and so I say, am I the biggest? And they go, we're not allowed to tell you,</v>

80
00:04:34.530 --> 00:04:36.180
but they wink at me. Yeah.

81
00:04:37.260 --> 00:04:38.970
<v 0>Yeah, of course they send those guys up.</v>

82
00:04:39.060 --> 00:04:42.000
And of course they're not going to shut down. Ty Lopez.

83
00:04:42.210 --> 00:04:46.620
He's keeping the wheels turning as sick as it is. Get rich,

84
00:04:46.621 --> 00:04:50.490
quick schemes, pyramid schemes. They make a lot of money.

85
00:04:50.491 --> 00:04:52.710
And I want to show you, um,

86
00:04:52.770 --> 00:04:57.750
the kind of crazy reasoning they use to stay within Google compliance,

87
00:04:57.780 --> 00:05:00.390
okay. In their videos, they make these insane claims,

88
00:05:00.660 --> 00:05:05.220
but they stay legal by making these ridiculous disclaimers all the way at the

89
00:05:05.221 --> 00:05:05.491
bottom.

90
00:05:05.491 --> 00:05:09.270
And I'm going to show you exactly what I mean because by if the world were just

91
00:05:09.420 --> 00:05:13.050
what I'm about to show you would be considered a scam or a get rich quick

92
00:05:13.051 --> 00:05:16.950
opportunity, which is technically against Google's terms of service.

93
00:05:18.270 --> 00:05:18.991
<v 3>Hi guys, Robby here.</v>

94
00:05:18.991 --> 00:05:21.330
And how would you like to learn how to make a thousand dollars a day online?

95
00:05:21.720 --> 00:05:26.280
<v 0>A thousand dollars is that online now, as a quick reminder, get rich,</v>

96
00:05:26.281 --> 00:05:29.970
quick schemes are supposedly against YouTube policies.

97
00:05:30.300 --> 00:05:34.560
Remember get rich, quick schemes are against their policies.

98
00:05:34.590 --> 00:05:36.090
You're not allowed to do this.

99
00:05:36.270 --> 00:05:39.870
It's considered a spam deceptive practices and scams policies.

100
00:05:39.900 --> 00:05:42.990
And yet this is what I got advertised on Google today.

101
00:05:43.020 --> 00:05:44.880
And you could get it to you probably got one on this bit. Yeah.

102
00:05:45.240 --> 00:05:46.680
<v 3>In this training. And in this video,</v>

103
00:05:46.681 --> 00:05:49.380
I'm going to share with you my three-step method on how I've been able to do

104
00:05:49.381 --> 00:05:50.520
that guys. So as a matter of fact,

105
00:05:50.700 --> 00:05:53.550
it doesn't matter if you have any experience whatsoever. Uh,

106
00:05:53.551 --> 00:05:55.740
it doesn't matter how old you are this, Hey.

00:05:56.370 --> 00:06:00.800
<v 0>You can get rich. Even if you're young, if you're like 12 years old, if you're,</v>

108
00:06:00.970 --> 00:06:04.160
you know, any age, no experience required, this is the classic.

109
00:06:04.161 --> 00:06:07.820
Get rich quick scheme, a thousand dollars a day, nothing necessary right now.

110
00:06:07.850 --> 00:06:08.720
You don't need anything.

111
00:06:08.990 --> 00:06:12.050
Now let me show you how they get around it because there's a little,

112
00:06:12.200 --> 00:06:17.150
there's an abracadabra magic words that allows you to promote scams

113
00:06:17.151 --> 00:06:20.570
on YouTube. Ready? You go to his webpage. Here we go. Number one,

how you can generate a thousand dollars a day or more.

116
00:06:26.720 --> 00:06:28.520
And then you go all the way to the bottom.

117
00:06:28.521 --> 00:06:33.350
Look at that all the way at the bottom. And there here's the abracadabra word.

118
00:06:33.410 --> 00:06:37.700
It's so tiny. I have to go to like a thousand percent zoom to even read it.

119
00:06:37.850 --> 00:06:38.541
In summary,

120
00:06:38.541 --> 00:06:43.460

121
00:06:43.490 --> 00:06:47.720

131
00:07:11.711 --> 00:07:13.300
new referrals and goals.

132
00:07:14.110 --> 00:07:17.950
And that my friends is my response to some ordinary gamers

133
00:07:19.540 --> 00:07:22.840
right here, right here. YouTube knows what they're doing.

134
00:07:23.050 --> 00:07:25.330
They know what's paying the bills.

135
00:07:26.170 --> 00:07:30.190
They know what's generating the revenue here.

136
00:07:30.850 --> 00:07:32.710
Ty Lopez was their number one,

137
00:07:33.040 --> 00:07:37.900
non like gigantic brand like Coca-Cola advertiser. Right?

138
00:07:38.440 --> 00:07:40.630
These guys are paying the big bucks and that's,

139
00:07:40.631 --> 00:07:44.110
what's preventing YouTube from doing a mega crackdown on YouTube.

140
00:07:44.111 --> 00:07:49.060
I probably spent, I would say 25 to 30,

141
00:07:49.330 --> 00:07:53.200
maybe 45 million bucks as creators. You and I, we mess up,

142
00:07:54.370 --> 00:07:58.120
dude. You're lucky. If you get a strike, your channel could just get removed.

143
00:07:58.150 --> 00:07:58.990
We've seen that happen.

144
00:07:59.170 --> 00:08:03.310
But if a scammer says you can make a thousand dollars a day online with no

145
00:08:03.311 --> 00:08:06.880
experience, no kind of training from any age. Oh, don't worry. Hey,

146
00:08:06.940 --> 00:08:08.440
did you not see his fine print?

147
00:08:08.950 --> 00:08:12.940
Did you not see his fine print on page seven of the income disclosure does not

148
00:08:12.941 --> 00:08:16.150
click on the earnings. Disclaimer. Oops. Anyway guys,

149
00:08:16.151 --> 00:08:18.310
don't I have a little heated. I'm going to be honest,

150
00:08:18.580 --> 00:08:20.320
but that I wanted to make a quick response.

151
00:08:20.770 --> 00:08:23.830
Not so quick response to somewhere near gamers. Thanks for the shout-out.

152
00:08:24.160 --> 00:08:27.850
Thanks for the follows guys. And um, as always.

153
00:08:28.120 --> 00:08:32.410
