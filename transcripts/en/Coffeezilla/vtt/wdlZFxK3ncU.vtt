00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:00.863
<v 0>Hey,</v>

2
00:00:01.140 --> 00:00:05.580
let me tell you this these day traders are out of control.

3
00:00:05.880 --> 00:00:10.800
Okay. Uh, because they keep promising bigger and bigger numbers.

4
00:00:10.830 --> 00:00:11.700
And I wonder,

5
00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:16.590
has common sense checked in with any of these guys. I mean,

6
00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:21.360
it used to be that you would say I made like 600 bucks on a yellow

7
00:00:21.361 --> 00:00:26.130
call. Now we're talking about turning 20 K accounts,

8
00:00:26.131 --> 00:00:30.900
30 K accounts into millions of dollars in some of you guys believe

9
00:00:30.901 --> 00:00:34.800
it. All right, let's check this out. Last week's results.

10
00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:39.440
1.8 million guys, what your do now, currently, as we're doing this interview,

11
00:00:39.710 --> 00:00:44.600
uh, this week I passed 6.7 million in profits from 1500 of your own money.

12
00:00:44.690 --> 00:00:49.280
And so you believe these people when they they're just nobodies and they

13
00:00:49.281 --> 00:00:52.310
claim to have made millions of dollars with the stock market.

14
00:00:53.210 --> 00:00:57.260
And I don't know where the reality checks need to start coming in,

15
00:00:57.740 --> 00:01:01.310
but these advertisements are getting ridiculous and they must be getting

16
00:01:01.311 --> 00:01:03.620
ridiculous. Cause they work on some people, right?

17
00:01:03.621 --> 00:01:06.680
Like people do believe this stuff. And it's unbelievable. Well,

18
00:01:06.770 --> 00:01:11.030
and guess what guys I've officially turned $50,000

19
00:01:11.630 --> 00:01:14.600
into $1 million in just two months.

20
00:01:14.990 --> 00:01:18.950
This is new our trades page. Let's look at this.

21
00:01:19.250 --> 00:01:21.470
We're out of control. This has gone too far.

22
00:01:21.800 --> 00:01:26.030
18 year old turns 20 K into $2 million in six months.

23
00:01:26.300 --> 00:01:29.390
Of course he does. Right? And the tooth fairy helped him.

24
00:01:29.720 --> 00:01:34.310
Are we insane that we lost all common sense, but if you go to his Instagram,

25
00:01:34.311 --> 00:01:37.280
we see who this guy is about. Oh, sorry. That's our next guy.

26
00:01:37.310 --> 00:01:42.230
That's trillionaire club. Um, they, sorry, this is our guy. Here we go.

27
00:01:42.260 --> 00:01:46.520
Ooh. Look at this guy. Look at the jacket that he rented for the photo shoot.

28
00:01:46.940 --> 00:01:48.950
I'm giving away $1,000.

29
00:01:51.140 --> 00:01:52.640
Sorry to stop there, dude.

30
00:01:53.330 --> 00:01:57.260
You're trying to flex on people saying you made $2 million in six months and

31
00:01:57.261 --> 00:02:01.190
your giveaway is $1,000, buddy. You need to,

32
00:02:01.191 --> 00:02:02.840
if you're going to convince us that you're rich,

33
00:02:02.870 --> 00:02:05.390
you're going to have to try a little bit harder than that, dude. I think he,

34
00:02:06.170 --> 00:02:08.870
I think he overspent on the budget. Dude. Look at that necklace.

35
00:02:09.470 --> 00:02:12.230
Look at this car. Look at the jet. He overspent.

36
00:02:12.240 --> 00:02:16.040
He's probably in debt credit card debt from paying for this little mini

37
00:02:16.041 --> 00:02:19.250
commercial on, on his Instagram. He couldn't afford the giveaway. Dude,

38
00:02:20.240 --> 00:02:23.540
ignore trades that I'm known for turning $20,000 into a little over 2 million.

39
00:02:23.990 --> 00:02:25.100
By the way, I love when they do that,

40
00:02:25.130 --> 00:02:28.730
I'm known for insert what they want to be known for. Like, dude,

41
00:02:28.731 --> 00:02:30.620
you're not known for that. Nobody knows you for that.

42
00:02:30.950 --> 00:02:35.180
You're trying to get yourself known for that by saying, you're that? Hey guys,

43
00:02:35.181 --> 00:02:38.600
what's up coffee Zilla here known for my sick car's over here.

44
00:02:38.630 --> 00:02:43.040
I don't even talk about them ever, but I'm just known for my awesome cars.

45
00:02:43.400 --> 00:02:45.230
They just sit there, you know? No big deal, guys.

46
00:02:45.231 --> 00:02:48.590
You also may know me for my gigantic bank account.

47
00:02:49.330 --> 00:02:51.830
That's something I'm known for picking 10 lucky winners.

48
00:02:51.831 --> 00:02:55.130
And I'm giving each one off a hundred dollars just because all the support I've

49
00:02:55.131 --> 00:02:58.460
been receiving, you guys have been helping me out. I'm a millionaire.

50
00:02:58.730 --> 00:03:00.070
So just you guys just cause.

51
00:03:00.070 --> 00:03:00.670
<v 1>You're supporting.</v>

52
00:03:00.670 --> 00:03:03.340
<v 0>Me a hundred dollars hundred dollar giveaway.</v>

53
00:03:03.780 --> 00:03:06.720
<v 1>It's time for me to give back. All you need to do is like this video,</v>

54
00:03:07.200 --> 00:03:10.080
share this on your story. It's like three people in the comments section.

55
00:03:10.740 --> 00:03:11.610
<v 0>It's a lot, honestly,</v>

56
00:03:11.611 --> 00:03:15.120
for a hundred dollars liking tagging three people and sharing this on your

57
00:03:15.121 --> 00:03:16.200
story. It's a lot,

58
00:03:16.320 --> 00:03:21.030
but none of this is why we're talking about new our trades today because this

59
00:03:21.031 --> 00:03:25.560
guy has a moment on YouTube. It's sort of one of those YouTube history moments,

60
00:03:26.370 --> 00:03:28.650
uh, like the boom goes the dynamite kid.

61
00:03:29.010 --> 00:03:30.300
<v 1>And boom goes the dynamite.</v>

62
00:03:31.020 --> 00:03:35.310
<v 0>It's just like this amazing piece of internet that I don't think anyone's caught</v>

63
00:03:35.670 --> 00:03:40.140
onto yet. I don't think anyone's noticed that this has happened except for me.

64
00:03:40.500 --> 00:03:45.120
And now you guys, because this guy ran a little commercial, okay.

65
00:03:45.210 --> 00:03:49.560
He ran a little commercial on lofts, YouTube channel. If you guys know this guy,

66
00:03:49.561 --> 00:03:53.100
he does a bunch of chatting with millionaire pieces. He's pretty,

67
00:03:53.160 --> 00:03:54.090
pretty interesting guy.

68
00:03:54.150 --> 00:03:56.520
But what happened with noir traits is he actually had to,

69
00:03:56.521 --> 00:03:59.940
he doesn't have a big enough following for loft to actually bring them on the

70
00:03:59.941 --> 00:04:01.590
channel just normally. Um,

71
00:04:01.591 --> 00:04:06.150
so the guy has him pay $4,000 to get on his show. He goes,

72
00:04:06.151 --> 00:04:07.740
I'll probably have more trades on again.

73
00:04:07.741 --> 00:04:09.660
I'm all the way you guys think he's a scam, but you might be,

74
00:04:09.661 --> 00:04:12.600
but he's paying me 4k this time. So I can't refuse.

75
00:04:12.601 --> 00:04:15.870
He's out of my once before which he paid three K that time.

76
00:04:16.200 --> 00:04:20.400
So this kid is paying to be on the guy show. Okay?

77
00:04:20.490 --> 00:04:24.570
That's an important part of this to understand how hilarious this moment is

78
00:04:25.200 --> 00:04:27.330
because he comes on the show. So this is a,

79
00:04:27.630 --> 00:04:29.520
basically a commercial and bear in mind,

80
00:04:29.521 --> 00:04:32.820
this kid can barely afford a thousand dollars giveaway. So this is a big buck.

81
00:04:33.090 --> 00:04:37.230
Give away here. He comes in this guy show and rather than getting a commercial,

82
00:04:37.500 --> 00:04:39.960
he gets roasted the entire time.

83
00:04:40.410 --> 00:04:43.470
<v 2>This guy makes money off people. Not off stocks</v>

84
00:04:46.560 --> 00:04:50.820
Went over that. Well,

85
00:04:51.360 --> 00:04:53.820
I actually just posted. What's your response to that?

86
00:04:53.940 --> 00:04:58.260
<v 1>I mean people, so look, I mean,</v>

87
00:04:58.950 --> 00:05:02.400
uh, well you see Andrew, uh,

88
00:05:02.490 --> 00:05:05.790
I mean people, so look, it didn't think.

89
00:05:05.880 --> 00:05:08.880
<v 0>We'd be going over this. I paid you 4k to be on your show.</v>

90
00:05:08.881 --> 00:05:13.440
I thought you'd helped me out. I mean, to be fair under the fold, there is,

91
00:05:13.441 --> 00:05:16.200
he is shouting the guy out. He gives the registration,

92
00:05:16.201 --> 00:05:18.420
he is doing a commercial forum,

93
00:05:19.050 --> 00:05:21.630
but he brings up some hilarious stuff.

94
00:05:21.660 --> 00:05:23.790
And some of it rings really close to home.

95
00:05:24.090 --> 00:05:28.260
But look at how this sociopath answers one of these questions because one of

96
00:05:28.261 --> 00:05:31.290
them is actually about one of his well-known frauds.

97
00:05:31.320 --> 00:05:36.300
This guy is a known fraudster who stole signal information from

98
00:05:36.301 --> 00:05:39.090
another guru. He can't even come up with his own guru crowds.

99
00:05:40.200 --> 00:05:45.060
<v 2>Ruthless. Um, just so everyone knows this.</v>

100
00:05:45.390 --> 00:05:49.320
Guy's just copying people from other chats. He's not legitimate. Watch out.

101
00:05:49.321 --> 00:05:50.154
Do your research.

102
00:05:51.450 --> 00:05:55.710
<v 0>Is guys, did you see that? Look at this response, but get this response.</v>

103
00:05:55.740 --> 00:05:58.460
This is something he been caught doing.

104
00:05:58.461 --> 00:06:03.020
He's been caught stealing from other gurus and trying to sell it off as his own.

105
00:06:03.021 --> 00:06:07.280
Now he wasn't even stealing that well, and we'll get into that in a second,

106
00:06:07.281 --> 00:06:08.810
but look at how he reacts to this.

107
00:06:11.500 --> 00:06:15.220
<v 2>Is that true? Yes. I mean, did you see anything I want to screen here?</v>

108
00:06:15.730 --> 00:06:20.050
Just had my discord open, had my tos. Okay.

109
00:06:20.590 --> 00:06:24.340
<v 0>Now with that response in mind, look, he goes, he goes, is that true?</v>

110
00:06:24.490 --> 00:06:27.160
You're stealing from people. Uh, well, uh,

111
00:06:27.190 --> 00:06:30.460
did you see me stealing from anybody at this particular second? Hey,

112
00:06:30.461 --> 00:06:33.430
that's not what he asked, but with all this in mind with this,

113
00:06:33.520 --> 00:06:36.010
let's add some context to this because new,

114
00:06:36.011 --> 00:06:40.000
our trades was caught definitively stealing from a,

115
00:06:40.001 --> 00:06:42.130
another YouTuber, uh,

116
00:06:42.520 --> 00:06:46.210
and another guru called stock Hunter trading. Now this guy,

117
00:06:46.240 --> 00:06:49.600
I am not at all, endorsing him.

118
00:06:50.200 --> 00:06:51.400
Literally just take one.

119
00:06:51.401 --> 00:06:55.270
Look at his Twitter page to realize what kind of quality information this guy is

120
00:06:55.271 --> 00:06:59.110
giving out. I'm sorry, stock Hunter. Now, how did he get caught? Well,

121
00:06:59.290 --> 00:07:02.740
new our trades joined this. Guy's a discord chat.

122
00:07:02.741 --> 00:07:06.490
Remember he supposedly his origin story. It's like a superhero.

123
00:07:06.520 --> 00:07:10.390
His origin story was that he made millions of dollars in the stock market when

124
00:07:10.391 --> 00:07:13.450
he was 18 years old. So a year after this,

125
00:07:13.750 --> 00:07:18.490
he's caught in this guy's discord group. Okay. This is his email up here.

126
00:07:18.491 --> 00:07:22.540
I'll blur it out. And he's caught paying for this guy's discord signals group.

127
00:07:22.570 --> 00:07:26.890
And the guy starts noticing that he's on his own discourse signals group.

128
00:07:26.900 --> 00:07:31.060
So this is where you pay for someone's stock tips, idiotic, uh,

129
00:07:31.120 --> 00:07:33.340
this other guy's discord stock group. They were the same.

130
00:07:33.341 --> 00:07:36.310
They're giving out the same advice and war trades is giving it out like five

131
00:07:36.311 --> 00:07:38.020
minutes after. So the guy started realizing, Oh,

132
00:07:38.021 --> 00:07:41.830
he's stealing my stock tips and just giving it to his subscribers as if he

133
00:07:41.831 --> 00:07:46.720
thought of it. So what he did is this. He started uploading to his chat room.

134
00:07:46.721 --> 00:07:50.170
This is his side right here, and this is more trades over on the right.

135
00:07:50.410 --> 00:07:53.710
He started uploading his with a watermark. Okay.

136
00:07:53.711 --> 00:07:56.680
I don't know if you guys can see that down there. There's a little watermark.

137
00:07:56.681 --> 00:07:59.410
He'll zoom in, in a second. And the question is wouldn't wire trades.

138
00:07:59.411 --> 00:08:02.320
Copy it with the watermark image. Check it out.

139
00:08:02.740 --> 00:08:06.760
<v 3>I started my notes at 6:46 AM,</v>

140
00:08:07.420 --> 00:08:12.310
nor trades came in at 6:52 AM and copied me word for

141
00:08:12.311 --> 00:08:17.080
word. Here is my company logos stock Hunter trading,

142
00:08:17.200 --> 00:08:21.400
LLC. This is a watermark and he is copying it.

143
00:08:22.690 --> 00:08:25.450
<v 0>You literally can't get more busted than this.</v>

144
00:08:25.720 --> 00:08:27.400
And then imagine the fact that he's,

145
00:08:27.820 --> 00:08:32.740
he doesn't even have the decency to run away and stop being a guru and just

146
00:08:32.741 --> 00:08:36.490
realize, Hey, obviously I was faking it guys. Ha got a few of you. You know,

147
00:08:36.491 --> 00:08:39.610
you guys paid me 200 bucks a month for my discord signals group.

148
00:08:39.880 --> 00:08:43.810
And I got like $200,000 a month. Total. I ripped you guys off, but ha ha.

149
00:08:43.840 --> 00:08:48.700
I was just a prank row. He doesn't even have the decency, the shame to do that.

150
00:08:48.701 --> 00:08:52.450
Instead what he does is he goes on loft. He tries to run a commercial,

151
00:08:52.780 --> 00:08:56.370
thinking that no one's going to catch him. This guy's just copying.

152
00:08:56.370 --> 00:09:00.690
<v 2>People from other chats. He's not legitimate. Watch out do your research.</v>

153
00:09:02.300 --> 00:09:03.133
<v 0>Dude.</v>

154
00:09:03.200 --> 00:09:07.910
I will pay for that to forever be enshrined that if I ever create a Twitch

155
00:09:07.940 --> 00:09:10.520
chat or I don't know if I can do this for like YouTube remote.

156
00:09:10.760 --> 00:09:15.590
I want that to be one of them. Dude,

157
00:09:15.860 --> 00:09:20.600
just the realization I paid this guy $4,000 and he's

158
00:09:20.601 --> 00:09:24.620
bringing up my biggest, most embarrassing moment of my entire career.

159
00:09:24.770 --> 00:09:27.290
One that de legitimizes me forever. By the way,

160
00:09:27.500 --> 00:09:31.610
if you ever follow this guy's discord group while knowing this you're an idiot,

161
00:09:31.790 --> 00:09:35.090
because clearly he doesn't know what he's doing, trading stocks,

162
00:09:35.420 --> 00:09:40.190
but not only was he stealing from this guy, he also was asking for help.

163
00:09:40.430 --> 00:09:41.150
So this is,

164
00:09:41.150 --> 00:09:44.480
these are things he posted to the guys discord group while he was still a part

165
00:09:44.481 --> 00:09:47.810
of it. He got kicked out, look at this. Okay? So no swing.

166
00:09:48.110 --> 00:09:50.120
Would you swing anything? He's talking about swing trading,

167
00:09:50.360 --> 00:09:52.040
Shopify two 90 calls for a swing.

168
00:09:52.160 --> 00:09:55.190
He's asking questions because he doesn't know what he's doing.

169
00:09:55.730 --> 00:09:57.440
He doesn't know how to trade.

170
00:09:57.500 --> 00:10:02.000
So he's asking for help from this guy who then he kind of steals his whole

171
00:10:02.001 --> 00:10:05.540
thing. And again, this is not like stealing from Warren buffet here.

172
00:10:05.570 --> 00:10:09.410
Remember who we're dealing with here, guys? This is so embarrassing.

173
00:10:10.220 --> 00:10:13.850
If this happened to me, I would never show my face again on the internet.

174
00:10:13.940 --> 00:10:18.470
But these ti doesn't care. He just keeps going and going and going.

175
00:10:20.330 --> 00:10:22.820
<v 2>Hat's he's not legitimate. Watch out do your research.</v>

176
00:10:23.930 --> 00:10:25.880
<v 0>Anyway. I just thought you guys would really enjoy that.</v>

177
00:10:25.910 --> 00:10:29.120
Let me know what you guys think. This is just nonstop.

178
00:10:29.150 --> 00:10:32.390
Where do we draw the line? I think anyone under 30,

179
00:10:32.450 --> 00:10:34.790
we should all not listen to including myself, dude,

180
00:10:34.940 --> 00:10:36.830
if we can all take this advice collectively,

181
00:10:36.831 --> 00:10:39.110
I'm happy for you guys not to listen to my advice. In fact,

182
00:10:39.111 --> 00:10:42.110
I don't really give advice much. I mean really?

183
00:10:42.111 --> 00:10:43.880
I just tell you guys who not to listen to,

184
00:10:44.210 --> 00:10:46.610
which is not hard to do because there's so many idiots out there,

185
00:10:46.820 --> 00:10:49.160
but I'm not trying to tell you how to live your life because frankly,

186
00:10:49.340 --> 00:10:53.450
I don't know. Listen, Jesus waited till he was 30 to start preaching.

187
00:10:53.930 --> 00:10:55.880
If that's good enough for Jesus, it's good enough for me.

188
00:10:55.881 --> 00:10:57.050
I'm going to wait till I'm 30.

189
00:10:57.200 --> 00:11:01.010
Before I start spitting out my guru at times while I'm 31, I'm 30.

190
00:11:01.010 --> 00:11:02.000
I'm just going to create a course.

191
00:11:02.001 --> 00:11:03.320
And I'm going to tell y'all how to live your life.

192
00:11:03.590 --> 00:11:06.170
But until then you shouldn't listen to me and you shouldn't listen to all these

193
00:11:06.171 --> 00:11:11.060
idiots. 18 years old millionaire. No, no dude,

194
00:11:11.270 --> 00:11:13.010
are you kidding? It's got to stop.

195
00:11:13.070 --> 00:11:14.870
At some point you got to have some life experience.

196
00:11:14.871 --> 00:11:17.120
It's the Caleb Maddix thing all over again. Dude,

197
00:11:17.300 --> 00:11:21.560
the kid is 17 trying to coach everybody else. It's like, dude,

198
00:11:21.561 --> 00:11:24.740
you haven't earned that right to be a coach. You haven't done anything.

199
00:11:25.490 --> 00:11:28.190
And so that's what I'm super passionate about.

200
00:11:28.191 --> 00:11:30.140
At some point we got to draw the line.

201
00:11:30.170 --> 00:11:32.720
I know that's going to get a lot of people. They're going to say, Hey, no,

202
00:11:32.721 --> 00:11:36.710
I'm a 20 year old. I'm a coach, but I'm going to say no dude.

203
00:11:36.770 --> 00:11:41.180
And if you doubt me, if you think I'm wrong, come on the show, please.

204
00:11:41.210 --> 00:11:43.940
It's been a while. Since we've done a debate, I'd love to talk about this.

205
00:11:43.970 --> 00:11:47.390
Do you think that 20 year olds should be coaches or math?

206
00:11:47.420 --> 00:11:48.920
They should be running masterminds.

207
00:11:48.921 --> 00:11:52.640
Do you think they should be teaching all the rest of us?

208
00:11:52.670 --> 00:11:54.190
Let me in the comment section below,

209
00:11:54.191 --> 00:11:56.110
I know that's a little sensational and as always.
