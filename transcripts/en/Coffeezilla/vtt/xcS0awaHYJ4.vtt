00:00:00.180 --> 00:00:02.010
<v 0>Ladies and gentlemen, you might be asking yourself,</v>

2
00:00:02.011 --> 00:00:05.040
what has Alex Jones so upset right now?

3
00:00:07.440 --> 00:00:09.900
What is going on? I've never seen him like,

4
00:00:10.020 --> 00:00:12.330
as I've been as media buyer for a very long time,

5
00:00:14.220 --> 00:00:19.110
I've never seen a big upset. I think I might have the answer guys.

6
00:00:19.111 --> 00:00:23.610
It's because I recently showed him a clip of copycat Kevin Davidson.

7
00:00:23.630 --> 00:00:26.330
<v 1>What is up guys? And welcome back to another exciting video.</v>

8
00:00:26.780 --> 00:00:27.530
<v 0>That's right. Ladies and gentlemen,</v>

9
00:00:27.530 --> 00:00:30.410
Kevin David is back to stealing content on the internet.

10
00:00:30.411 --> 00:00:33.170
Look at this lady three months ago, she did a video that did pretty well.

11
00:00:33.171 --> 00:00:37.310
How I made three K in a week and Kevin David is back. Just ripping it off.

12
00:00:37.311 --> 00:00:38.144
Completely.

13
00:00:38.150 --> 00:00:41.210
<v 1>Check it out. Either you are out of work. Maybe you're out of work,</v>

14
00:00:41.211 --> 00:00:45.950
selling old clothes, old clothing or shoes on Poshmark

15
00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:49.403
[inaudible] and parcel.

16
00:00:49.430 --> 00:00:52.760
<v 0>Now this is nothing new. We've known copycat Kevin for a very long time.</v>

17
00:00:52.761 --> 00:00:54.260
I've talked about him in the past. Okay?

18
00:00:54.261 --> 00:00:56.420
I'm not bringing this up to tell you about copycat. Kevin,

19
00:00:56.421 --> 00:00:59.930
I'm bringing you up to talk about his son. That's right. Kevin,

20
00:00:59.931 --> 00:01:04.370
David has children and I'm not talking about literally has children.

21
00:01:04.371 --> 00:01:08.660
I'm saying he's got a bunch of many MES running around because when we don't

22
00:01:09.350 --> 00:01:10.940
crack down on plagiarism,

23
00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:15.680
but we don't have any consequences for stealing content. Well,

24
00:01:15.710 --> 00:01:17.240
there's going to be problems.

25
00:01:17.241 --> 00:01:19.610
You're going to have problems in the ecosystem because people are going to see

26
00:01:19.611 --> 00:01:20.930
that they're going to see, Hey, Kevin,

27
00:01:20.931 --> 00:01:25.010
David's just stealing people's content and just rewording it a little bit to try

28
00:01:25.011 --> 00:01:28.670
to make it his own. I mean, but it's still plagiarism. And he's got 1.1,

29
00:01:28.671 --> 00:01:32.300
5 million subscribers because his audience is too dumb to realize what's going

30
00:01:32.301 --> 00:01:36.200
on. So people are going to try to go out and copy what he's doing.

31
00:01:36.201 --> 00:01:38.630
They're going to copy the copier, right? It's a,

32
00:01:38.900 --> 00:01:41.750
it's a copy of a copy of a copy of a copy of a copy.

33
00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:44.720
And that is who I want to talk about today. There's a,

34
00:01:44.870 --> 00:01:49.370
there's a new guru on the block trying to copy Kevin David's copycat strategy.

35
00:01:49.371 --> 00:01:53.060
And I've got, got to nip it in the buddy air, snip, snip names, Richard, you,

36
00:01:53.061 --> 00:01:54.950
before he gets too powerful. Look at this kid.

37
00:01:55.040 --> 00:01:59.420
He's already got 114,000 subscribers. Let's check out his content, right? Okay.

38
00:01:59.630 --> 00:02:03.020
How I tricked my brain, like to like doing hard things. Okay.

39
00:02:03.050 --> 00:02:04.940
This video is a copy.

40
00:02:05.180 --> 00:02:07.970
See if you type it in there's a guy who already did this video.

41
00:02:07.971 --> 00:02:09.560
He did it very successfully. 2 million views.

42
00:02:09.770 --> 00:02:13.220
So this guy saw it copied the exact title.

43
00:02:13.340 --> 00:02:16.130
And then look at the video itself. Here's the first one.

44
00:02:16.170 --> 00:02:17.900
<v 2>Video to answer this question,</v>

45
00:02:17.901 --> 00:02:21.380
we need to look at this brain neurotransmitter dopamine.

46
00:02:21.500 --> 00:02:22.750
Now let's see what Richard.

47
00:02:23.630 --> 00:02:27.260
<v 1>So the fundamental concept here that I need for you to understand is actually</v>

48
00:02:27.290 --> 00:02:29.240
this neurotransmitter called dopamine.

49
00:02:29.660 --> 00:02:32.420
<v 2>Dopamine is often considered a pleasure molecule.</v>

50
00:02:32.480 --> 00:02:34.970
Dopamine is what makes us desire things.

51
00:02:35.210 --> 00:02:38.960
And it's that desire that gives us the motivation to get up and do stuff.

52
00:02:38.990 --> 00:02:39.620
It's a pleasure.

53
00:02:39.620 --> 00:02:41.490
<v 0>Motivation, desire. Let's see what Richard us.</v>

54
00:02:41.900 --> 00:02:46.160
<v 1>Dopamine is typically associated with pleasure as well as motivation,</v>

55
00:02:46.220 --> 00:02:49.040
more specifically desire. This is just.

56
00:02:49.160 --> 00:02:53.630
<v 0>Shameless, man. And it's all from Kevin David. He pioneered the Hey,</v>

57
00:02:53.810 --> 00:02:57.260
all you do is you copy the transcript and then you slightly reword it to try to

58
00:02:57.261 --> 00:03:00.490
pretend it's your own. And you just it as if it's your own idea,

59
00:03:00.640 --> 00:03:03.220
you're not reworking them. You're not being inspired.

60
00:03:03.221 --> 00:03:07.240
You're just taking the entire structure of the idea and you're ripping it right

61
00:03:07.241 --> 00:03:12.130
off, but guys, it doesn't stop there. That's right. I'm I bring the value.

62
00:03:12.190 --> 00:03:14.740
Okay. It gets even worse. Richard's not the only one.

63
00:03:14.741 --> 00:03:17.920
Now people are doing it to Sam ovens. Somebody sent me this.

64
00:03:17.950 --> 00:03:21.310
This is a famous ad of Sam ovens. That a lot of people are apparently stealing.

65
00:03:21.580 --> 00:03:24.370
He goes, Hey, it's Sam ovens here. I'm not an author speaker investor. In fact,

66
00:03:24.371 --> 00:03:28.000
I have zero Lamborghini, zero jets, zero stages spoken on. Here's what I do.

67
00:03:28.001 --> 00:03:31.630
I have two products, eight figures and annual figure zero debt, one Forbes,

68
00:03:31.631 --> 00:03:35.020
30 under 30 blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah. So what do people do?

69
00:03:35.021 --> 00:03:38.320
This guy has a successful idea. What do they do? Well, check out this idiot.

70
00:03:38.380 --> 00:03:40.510
Hey, it's Dickson robot care. I'm not an author.

71
00:03:40.511 --> 00:03:42.370
Speaker software company or marketing agency.

72
00:03:42.371 --> 00:03:46.000
In fact I have zero Pennsy zero Aerojet zero stages spoken on. [inaudible] copy.

73
00:03:46.001 --> 00:03:47.920
Copy. Copy. Copy. Got me. And here's what I do.

74
00:03:47.921 --> 00:03:50.320
I have three successful fitness facilities, 14 years in the game.

75
00:03:50.500 --> 00:03:53.350
Seven figures in Arabic. He just copies it right off.

76
00:03:53.380 --> 00:03:56.890
Here's another one of these idiots, big little gyms. Hey will Hearst here.

77
00:03:56.891 --> 00:03:59.050
I'm not a speaker author or a software company. In fact,

78
00:03:59.051 --> 00:04:02.290
I have zero Lamborghini's Aerojet zero stage of smoking on zero social media

79
00:04:02.291 --> 00:04:04.810
presence. Zero. Here's what I do have two micro gyms launch,

80
00:04:04.850 --> 00:04:07.390
10 years in the game. Seven figures, annual revenue. Hey,

81
00:04:08.320 --> 00:04:12.550
you steal and get an original idea. These people, I swear.

82
00:04:12.700 --> 00:04:14.470
They don't have any ideas for themselves.

83
00:04:14.590 --> 00:04:18.610
They're recycling and recycling and recycling and recycling.

84
00:04:18.700 --> 00:04:21.580
These are not people you want to copy because there are a copy of the copy of

85
00:04:21.581 --> 00:04:25.840
the copy of the copy. This is not how you build a brand. They go, Hey,

86
00:04:25.841 --> 00:04:29.020
that's a good idea. Let me the yank. Let me yank it.

87
00:04:29.230 --> 00:04:32.500
If you see someone copies something and it's blatant, you know what I mean?

88
00:04:32.530 --> 00:04:36.520
We're talking literal, yanking it. If you see someone yank,

89
00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:41.410
you gotta head out the back door. Dude, unsubscribed, Inc. Oops,

90
00:04:41.530 --> 00:04:43.630
North flow consulting. Not going to happen.

91
00:04:43.690 --> 00:04:46.570
How do you think they're going to help you? They want to be your coach.

92
00:04:46.690 --> 00:04:47.650
What are they going to teach you?

93
00:04:47.651 --> 00:04:51.280
If they're literally copying another coach and that coach probably copied

94
00:04:51.281 --> 00:04:52.114
another coach.

95
00:04:52.470 --> 00:04:55.110
<v 2>It's a copy of a copy of a copy.</v>

96
00:04:55.530 --> 00:04:59.250
<v 0>A plagiarism has gone too far and I, for one blame, Kevin, David,</v>

97
00:04:59.280 --> 00:05:03.510
was he the start of it? Probably not, but I blame him. I blame him. Nonetheless.

98
00:05:03.570 --> 00:05:05.730
I don't know whose fault it is guys. You know that,

99
00:05:05.760 --> 00:05:09.810
but at some point the buck has to stop. So I dunno,

100
00:05:09.811 --> 00:05:13.050
maybe it's not a red flag to everyone, but for me when I see stuff like this,

101
00:05:13.051 --> 00:05:17.130
blatant stealing I'm out anyway, that's all for now. Thanks for watching.

102
00:05:17.640 --> 00:05:22.140
<v 2>And don't forget to smash like and subscribe. Thank you.</v>

103
00:05:22.260 --> 00:05:24.600
You need to perform a dopamine detox.

104
00:05:30.720 --> 00:05:30.720
[inaudible].
