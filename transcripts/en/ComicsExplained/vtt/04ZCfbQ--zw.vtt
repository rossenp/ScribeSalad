4
00:00:11.070 --> 00:00:11.860
What's going on here.

5
00:00:11.860 --> 00:00:15.170
<v 1>Guys. This is Rob and we are back with X's swords.</v>

6
00:00:15.440 --> 00:00:18.080
We're on part technically I think this is part 14.

7
00:00:18.081 --> 00:00:20.180
I know we combined combined two parts together.

8
00:00:20.181 --> 00:00:24.050
So I think we're officially one behind, uh, what the official numbering is,

9
00:00:24.051 --> 00:00:26.300
but it doesn't really matter. Uh, we're still going in order fields,

10
00:00:26.360 --> 00:00:27.470
the guys who were looking to catch up,

11
00:00:27.530 --> 00:00:29.990
you'll find the playlist down in the description. So you're not,

12
00:00:29.991 --> 00:00:32.150
you don't feel like you're kind of left out and because I know we're covering a

13
00:00:32.151 --> 00:00:34.970
lot of stories right now. So a lot of you guys may feel a little bit lost, uh,

14
00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:37.730
check out the playlist down to the description and that will give you everything

15
00:00:37.731 --> 00:00:40.430
you need to get caught up on the X-Men. So, ah,

16
00:00:40.460 --> 00:00:43.130
what we'll end up doing here is we pick up with the official start of the

17
00:00:43.131 --> 00:00:46.940
tournament, right? The official start of the duel between Coca-Cola and a Rocco.

18
00:00:47.030 --> 00:00:50.390
And this the initially starts out with Jubilee, resting alongside Shogo light,

19
00:00:50.750 --> 00:00:53.450
shadow, being a dragon that was once human and form and all that kind of stuff.

20
00:00:53.451 --> 00:00:56.270
Anyway, it's kind of like her adopted kid more or less,

21
00:00:56.300 --> 00:00:58.310
but the idea is that in the middle of taking this nap,

22
00:00:58.570 --> 00:01:01.640
she's suddenly met by a kind of telepathic message that essentially tells her,

23
00:01:01.641 --> 00:01:03.050
like, there's not a whole lot of time here,

24
00:01:03.110 --> 00:01:07.520
but in case you don't hear back from me, just know that things kind of went bad.

25
00:01:07.550 --> 00:01:09.980
Right. But I also care about, you know, this,

26
00:01:09.981 --> 00:01:13.190
of course this message is coming directly from, from Betsy Bradick right?

27
00:01:13.191 --> 00:01:15.080
The new captain Britain kind of a funny thing here.

28
00:01:15.081 --> 00:01:18.170
And I don't think he was given an official designation until recently,

29
00:01:18.230 --> 00:01:21.830
but Brian Bradick because he doesn't really wheel the amulet of right instead.

30
00:01:21.910 --> 00:01:24.830
And now he's using this sort of MYP. Uh, he's basically captain Avalon.

31
00:01:24.860 --> 00:01:26.930
That's really how that works now. But the idea is that,

32
00:01:26.931 --> 00:01:30.410
of course this kind of telepathic communication is cut off. Now Jubilees says,

33
00:01:30.440 --> 00:01:33.110
if I don't hear back from you by noon, like I'll come over there,

34
00:01:33.170 --> 00:01:35.540
but I'll come over there and find out what's going on. Now of course,

35
00:01:35.570 --> 00:01:39.650
the reason why this message was cut off is because Betsy Bradick was interrupted

36
00:01:39.730 --> 00:01:42.080
and you know, talking to Jubilee by ISCA, the unbeatable.

37
00:01:42.110 --> 00:01:45.200
And so it was one of these funny little things because ISCA has this kind of

38
00:01:45.201 --> 00:01:47.600
conversation where she talks to her and says, Hey,

39
00:01:47.630 --> 00:01:50.510
like you have the Knight of swords, right? Like that's an ill omen.

40
00:01:50.660 --> 00:01:53.570
And it's kind of like, you know, when we get out there, uh, you know, it,

41
00:01:53.750 --> 00:01:55.010
it's not too late for you to quit,

42
00:01:55.280 --> 00:01:57.680
but it's not too late for you to like give up. That's what you choose to do.

43
00:01:57.710 --> 00:01:59.720
And the response of Betsy Bradley was like, that's not going to happen,

44
00:01:59.870 --> 00:02:01.990
but I'm not going to quit. Like I'm not going to give up. And it's like,

45
00:02:02.090 --> 00:02:05.390
his whole idea is like, you shouldn't embarrass yourself out there. Right? Like,

46
00:02:05.391 --> 00:02:06.800
I mean, that doesn't need to happen.

47
00:02:06.801 --> 00:02:09.350
Like just give up now while everything's okay. Now keep in mind,

48
00:02:09.351 --> 00:02:11.930
this is not ISCA being kind and being friendly.

49
00:02:11.960 --> 00:02:15.260
It's her basically taunting Betsy Bradley. Right? Like you can't win against me.

50
00:02:15.261 --> 00:02:18.530
So the best thing for you to do is to give up, but it's to just quit.

51
00:02:18.560 --> 00:02:20.300
And it's one of these things where she kind of says like,

52
00:02:20.330 --> 00:02:22.130
of course it's not going to happen. And her response is,

53
00:02:22.131 --> 00:02:25.690
I'm just giving you some advice, right? Unbeatable is not just a name. And,

54
00:02:25.691 --> 00:02:29.270
and the funny thing is that when Betsy asks ISCA, like your sorts called mercy,

55
00:02:29.271 --> 00:02:32.300
right? She's like, don't get excited. That one is just a name, right?

56
00:02:32.301 --> 00:02:34.640
So when we get out there, I'm not stopping against you.

57
00:02:34.641 --> 00:02:37.370
Like I'm not holding back, I'm going to kill you. Right? Because keep in mind,

58
00:02:37.400 --> 00:02:39.600
this whole tournament is for keeps, right? This is,

59
00:02:39.601 --> 00:02:42.530
this is a fight to the death. That's what every single one of these battles is.

60
00:02:42.620 --> 00:02:44.570
And so what we end up doing is picking up with the officials,

61
00:02:44.571 --> 00:02:47.480
started the tournament with a handful of people from other world here.

62
00:02:47.481 --> 00:02:50.420
Now on the surface, it kind of looks like, man, there's like nobody here, right?

63
00:02:50.421 --> 00:02:52.130
Like nobody cares about this tournament.

64
00:02:52.160 --> 00:02:55.130
The reality of this is that as being held in such a way to where it's

65
00:02:55.131 --> 00:02:59.320
reminiscent of tournaments back during the era of, of like the dark ages,

66
00:02:59.340 --> 00:03:02.260
not really the dark ages, but like Knights and Kings and so on and so forth.

67
00:03:02.320 --> 00:03:04.030
That's how these kinds of tournaments were held. Right?

68
00:03:04.120 --> 00:03:06.790
They were relatively small, get togethers, different things.

69
00:03:06.791 --> 00:03:07.660
I thought they weren't huge.

70
00:03:07.720 --> 00:03:11.020
It wasn't like the Roman coliseums where you would have thousands of people who

71
00:03:11.021 --> 00:03:13.990
were there all lining the stands. There were never really that big,

72
00:03:14.050 --> 00:03:16.300
I guess Hollywood's kind of made it look like it was that big,

73
00:03:16.330 --> 00:03:18.430
but they were never really all that large in the first place.

74
00:03:18.520 --> 00:03:22.960
The other thing here is that Brian Bradick looks like the burger King guy from

75
00:03:22.961 --> 00:03:26.020
those creepy burger King commercials. I just want to throw that out there.

76
00:03:26.080 --> 00:03:27.220
That just needs to be said,

77
00:03:27.250 --> 00:03:30.610
I am 100% confident in stating here that was the intention

78
00:03:32.950 --> 00:03:35.590
because he is kind of a creep and he is a King and he loves burgers.

79
00:03:35.620 --> 00:03:38.440
So I guess it's only a matter of time before they made him look like the burger

80
00:03:38.441 --> 00:03:42.640
King. But having said that once ISCA and Betsy, Brad had come out here,

81
00:03:42.700 --> 00:03:45.220
run on the side of the Coca-Cola it's like, come on, Betsy, you got this,

82
00:03:45.221 --> 00:03:47.140
you got this. Right. But notice apocalypse,

83
00:03:47.170 --> 00:03:50.230
he's just kind of watching this whole thing go down because he's kind of like,

84
00:03:50.260 --> 00:03:52.810
okay, it's Betsy Bradick versus ISCA.

85
00:03:52.840 --> 00:03:55.900
The unbeatable what's the likelihood she can actually win here.

86
00:03:55.960 --> 00:03:57.760
And then once the fight starts, right?

87
00:03:57.761 --> 00:04:00.010
Like you have apocalypse kind of chimes in and says, you know,

88
00:04:00.011 --> 00:04:01.300
we're where captain Britain's like, man,

89
00:04:01.301 --> 00:04:04.270
she's got listened to bag the responsive of, of apocalypse as well.

90
00:04:04.330 --> 00:04:07.080
I've learned not to underestimate the, the heart and,

91
00:04:07.081 --> 00:04:10.420
and try to trust in the heart and the passion of young people.

92
00:04:10.480 --> 00:04:14.290
But understand Betsy Bradick is not that old, right? I mean, she's not,

93
00:04:14.291 --> 00:04:17.920
she's not been around as a fighter for a very long time. She was a telepath.

94
00:04:17.950 --> 00:04:19.150
She was an X man. Sure.

95
00:04:19.151 --> 00:04:22.030
She has the powers or the ability she had when she was Quentin for a little

96
00:04:22.031 --> 00:04:24.400
while when she switched bodies, would that Japanese Ninja,

97
00:04:24.460 --> 00:04:27.580
but SCA has been alive for centuries.

98
00:04:27.670 --> 00:04:30.040
Her skills have been honed for centuries.

99
00:04:30.070 --> 00:04:33.760
This is a girl that does not have the ability to lose and has also been fighting

100
00:04:33.761 --> 00:04:37.270
with a sword for longer than most all of you have been alive. Right?

101
00:04:37.271 --> 00:04:40.420
The only person here that I would say has been alive longer than ESCO or

102
00:04:40.421 --> 00:04:41.920
anywhere close to. However long it's been,

103
00:04:41.921 --> 00:04:45.250
has been alive is apocalypse everybody else here, every single X-Men,

104
00:04:45.251 --> 00:04:48.340
every single, every single person for Precoa has been alive that long. Right?

105
00:04:48.341 --> 00:04:51.220
Seemingly the blink of an eye and all of [inaudible] lifespan.

106
00:04:51.400 --> 00:04:55.300
And so when that happens, once the fight kicks off, things go kind of bonkers,

107
00:04:55.301 --> 00:04:56.950
right? Because you have Betsy Bradick,

108
00:04:57.070 --> 00:04:59.020
who's sort of intimidating a little bit and say, you can't lose.

109
00:04:59.050 --> 00:05:01.050
That just means you never learn how to win a fight or never,

110
00:05:01.070 --> 00:05:03.640
never learned how to fight anybody at all. And this was like, okay, cool.

111
00:05:03.670 --> 00:05:04.503
Let me prove you wrong.

112
00:05:04.540 --> 00:05:07.120
She literally attached and shatters the sores of Betsy Brodick,

113
00:05:07.150 --> 00:05:09.160
which in turn shatters, Betsy Bradick herself,

114
00:05:09.190 --> 00:05:13.060
the whole fight is over that fast. Like it was literally two hits, right?

115
00:05:13.180 --> 00:05:16.450
It was Betsy Bradick hitting ISCA and then ISCA hitting Betsy Bradick and then

116
00:05:16.660 --> 00:05:18.640
Bessie Braddock was destroyed just that fast.

117
00:05:18.641 --> 00:05:20.320
And so from there sat a needed step stand.

118
00:05:20.440 --> 00:05:21.910
This is the fight really over that fast,

119
00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:25.090
what kind of sucks like Mel was expecting it to be a little bit longer than that

120
00:05:25.150 --> 00:05:26.920
because apparently she ended up showing up here late.

121
00:05:26.980 --> 00:05:29.110
Now a lot of the guys are going to look at that and say,

122
00:05:29.260 --> 00:05:31.480
that kind of sucks to the fight is over that fast, right there.

123
00:05:31.690 --> 00:05:33.880
Should've been more to it than that. That's going to be a common theme,

124
00:05:33.910 --> 00:05:37.150
not because of the fact that Jonathan Hickman is cheating us out of the story,

125
00:05:37.210 --> 00:05:40.660
but because there's actually some pretty nefarious stuff going on here and we'll

126
00:05:40.661 --> 00:05:43.450
find out more of what that looks like here in a little bit. But from here,

127
00:05:43.520 --> 00:05:46.990
we switch over to Doug Ramsey right over to cipher and it's called gets drawn,

128
00:05:47.050 --> 00:05:48.700
which means he's supposed to be ready to fight.

129
00:05:48.730 --> 00:05:50.890
But the response that our neem is like, you know,

130
00:05:50.891 --> 00:05:53.440
this little party that we're having, it's definitely going to be a challenge.

131
00:05:53.500 --> 00:05:56.770
And your friend here better get used to learning how to speak every language,

132
00:05:56.800 --> 00:05:58.160
any learn how to do it fast.

133
00:05:58.190 --> 00:06:02.210
And the reason why is because he's kind of led away by a handful by like three

134
00:06:02.211 --> 00:06:05.030
gorgeous girls. Now I don't understand this about cipher, right?

135
00:06:05.030 --> 00:06:07.700
He's literally being led away by gorgeous girls. And he's like, Hey,

136
00:06:07.701 --> 00:06:10.610
let go of me. Where are you taking me guys help? Not me man.

137
00:06:11.030 --> 00:06:14.240
Like if I were a single man and I was being led away by three gorgeous girls,

138
00:06:14.241 --> 00:06:17.420
I'd be like, yes, ladies take me. But at the same time,

139
00:06:17.480 --> 00:06:21.470
they also end up taking one of the, one of the fighters from Morocco side.

140
00:06:21.560 --> 00:06:22.250
And so where they,

141
00:06:22.250 --> 00:06:24.800
where you initially had like store maybe a couple people who interject and say

142
00:06:24.801 --> 00:06:24.921
like,

143
00:06:24.921 --> 00:06:28.130
we have to do something through responsible rain after that vision that he saw,

144
00:06:28.160 --> 00:06:30.830
because I had a lot of, a couple of the guys ask him this question. Um,

145
00:06:30.890 --> 00:06:33.320
nothing that Wolverine saw actually came to fruition.

146
00:06:33.350 --> 00:06:37.400
It was a glimpse of what could happen if he actually did kill Saturday or if

147
00:06:37.850 --> 00:06:40.070
cacoa lost the tournament. Right. So it was just kind of a glimpse there.

148
00:06:40.320 --> 00:06:43.280
So again, it was all basically in his head, but you ended up having, you know,

149
00:06:43.700 --> 00:06:45.140
stormy kind of challenges that, and Wolverine's like, no,

150
00:06:45.170 --> 00:06:47.930
like we are not going to turn against the rules. If we win this,

151
00:06:47.931 --> 00:06:51.080
we have to win legit. Right. Anything other than that, and we will,

152
00:06:51.081 --> 00:06:52.460
it'll lead to the ruin of alt.

153
00:06:52.520 --> 00:06:56.360
And so these girls are kinda kind of lead cipher away. They lead this,

154
00:06:56.361 --> 00:06:58.400
this other, this other chick away. And then from there,

155
00:06:58.520 --> 00:07:00.410
they take them into a kind of tent of sorts.

156
00:07:00.500 --> 00:07:03.650
And it's kind of nuts because Brian Brodick looks to apocalypse and he was like,

157
00:07:03.700 --> 00:07:07.370
like, you had me worried that Betsy Bradick would be humiliated, not destroyed.

158
00:07:07.400 --> 00:07:09.830
And the responsible pocalypse is, are you really that stupid?

159
00:07:09.860 --> 00:07:11.150
We came here at a tournament,

160
00:07:11.240 --> 00:07:15.200
this literally designed to determine the fate of our, of our dimensions.

161
00:07:15.260 --> 00:07:18.110
And this is obviously a fight to the death. Did you really believe,

162
00:07:18.400 --> 00:07:19.600
believe that nobody was going to die?

163
00:07:19.660 --> 00:07:21.790
Did you really believe that was going to happen? Brian Bradley,

164
00:07:21.910 --> 00:07:24.400
are you really that dumb? Like it's, it's kind of funny, right?

165
00:07:25.660 --> 00:07:26.920
It's kind of hilarious, but he's like,

166
00:07:26.921 --> 00:07:30.310
I don't know why you ever thought this journey would be without sacrifice,

167
00:07:30.340 --> 00:07:32.380
right? Some of us will return home changed.

168
00:07:32.381 --> 00:07:34.240
Some of us will not return home at all.

169
00:07:34.300 --> 00:07:35.920
Now this is an important thing to understand here,

170
00:07:35.921 --> 00:07:39.820
because you remember with Betsy, Bradick basically being destroyed more or less.

171
00:07:39.850 --> 00:07:42.910
That means if they try to resurrect her in Krakatoa,

172
00:07:43.150 --> 00:07:46.030
that she'll come back a different version of herself, right? This is,

173
00:07:46.060 --> 00:07:48.880
this is one of the things that I mentioned when they previously introduced this

174
00:07:48.881 --> 00:07:52.150
at the very beginning of extra sorts. This is a way for Marvel to soft reboot,

175
00:07:52.180 --> 00:07:54.070
right? And that's what we see happening a lot, right?

176
00:07:54.070 --> 00:07:55.840
Over the years of Marvel comics, those guys, you don't,

177
00:07:55.870 --> 00:07:57.880
you don't really get that over the years of Marvel comics,

178
00:07:57.881 --> 00:08:00.790
their way of rebooting was totally different from DCS.

179
00:08:00.820 --> 00:08:04.930
DC would not really soft reboot characters. They would hard reboot, right?

180
00:08:04.931 --> 00:08:06.760
They would do event like crisis on infinite earths.

181
00:08:06.790 --> 00:08:10.000
They would do something like, like infinite crisis or new 50 T,

182
00:08:10.001 --> 00:08:12.160
which honestly crisis on infinite earths.

183
00:08:12.250 --> 00:08:16.360
And the new 52 are the only times that DC really hard rebooted their entire

184
00:08:16.361 --> 00:08:20.200
landscape. Uh, but what you'll get after those are mini crises, right?

185
00:08:20.201 --> 00:08:22.840
So you got crisis on defendant earth and then you've got zero hour.

186
00:08:22.870 --> 00:08:25.060
Then you got infinite crisis and you got final crisis.

187
00:08:25.090 --> 00:08:29.500
Those were designed to basically fix plot threads that had been left over after

188
00:08:29.501 --> 00:08:31.720
the events of a, of Christ on earth.

189
00:08:31.750 --> 00:08:34.300
You also get stories like black estate brightest tonight,

190
00:08:34.301 --> 00:08:36.970
and the green lantern mythos. That was a soft reboot, right?

191
00:08:37.000 --> 00:08:39.820
You get these small little things that are done here and there in DC to kind of

192
00:08:39.821 --> 00:08:43.000
bring small things back or change characters or something along those lines and

193
00:08:43.001 --> 00:08:46.300
Marvel, that's all they do. Marvel never hard reboots, right?

194
00:08:46.660 --> 00:08:49.210
Marvel's never had an instance of the history of their publication line,

195
00:08:49.240 --> 00:08:51.850
what it was like, you know, Marvel number zero, or you know,

196
00:08:52.210 --> 00:08:55.060
Spider-Man number zero. And this guy number zero iron man, number zero,

197
00:08:55.410 --> 00:08:57.870
captain American numbers zero. And it was just aligned wide reboot.

198
00:08:57.871 --> 00:09:00.270
That's never happened, I think is a problem. That's never happened,

199
00:09:00.360 --> 00:09:03.750
but that's never actually happened. Instead what Marvel does is stuff like this,

200
00:09:03.780 --> 00:09:06.840
right? So if Manuel, if Jonathan Hickman wants to rework, you know,

201
00:09:07.200 --> 00:09:09.600
Betsy brought it. If you looked at her character and he says, okay,

202
00:09:09.630 --> 00:09:11.910
over the years, she's kind of grown stagnant.

203
00:09:12.060 --> 00:09:15.090
And her history has been really weird and really shuffled and has kind of been a

204
00:09:15.091 --> 00:09:18.180
hassle to follow because it has right. Is anybody, let me tell you something,

205
00:09:18.181 --> 00:09:21.180
man, anybody who knows anything about the publication history,

206
00:09:21.181 --> 00:09:24.510
or even just the end universe history of Betsy Bradick will tell you it's a

207
00:09:24.511 --> 00:09:27.450
hassle, but it's an absolute nightmare to understand that.

208
00:09:27.660 --> 00:09:29.760
But if Hickman sits down and looks at that and says, yeah,

209
00:09:29.820 --> 00:09:32.910
we should rework Betsy Bradick. This is the way they do it. Right.

210
00:09:32.911 --> 00:09:34.320
She dies here in other world,

211
00:09:34.321 --> 00:09:36.420
which means that they can't bring her back to the way she was when they

212
00:09:36.421 --> 00:09:37.050
resurrector.

213
00:09:37.050 --> 00:09:40.560
It'll just be some random version of herself from across the multi-verse,

214
00:09:40.590 --> 00:09:43.080
which means whatever version we get is going to more or less,

215
00:09:43.081 --> 00:09:44.280
be a soft reboot of character.

216
00:09:44.281 --> 00:09:46.560
She's going to have a whole new history and all that kind of stuff.

217
00:09:46.710 --> 00:09:49.350
Why she's going to have to learn to probably reintegrate herself back into the

218
00:09:49.351 --> 00:09:50.580
X-Men things are going to be different.

219
00:09:50.670 --> 00:09:53.280
We might even get kind of a little bit of history of her own universe along the

220
00:09:53.281 --> 00:09:56.190
way, but whatever it is, she's going to come out different than she was before.

221
00:09:56.250 --> 00:09:59.970
The only exception to that is if she somehow reconstituted here the way she was

222
00:10:00.060 --> 00:10:01.440
and nothing's changed at all, right.

223
00:10:01.470 --> 00:10:03.780
But if she stays dead and they resurrect her and Coca-Cola,

224
00:10:03.810 --> 00:10:05.850
then it'll be a soft reboot of our character, right?

225
00:10:05.851 --> 00:10:09.210
So just kind of something to keep in mind. Now we're Douglas Ramsey is led away,

226
00:10:09.240 --> 00:10:12.630
right? This other person from a Rocco, this led away is a woman called Bay,

227
00:10:12.631 --> 00:10:13.290
the blood moon.

228
00:10:13.290 --> 00:10:16.710
And the idea behind this is that they has a set of powers that are almost

229
00:10:16.711 --> 00:10:20.040
identical to the powers of black bolt of the Inhumans.

230
00:10:20.100 --> 00:10:23.880
Right then once she can do is she can basically release something called a doom

231
00:10:23.881 --> 00:10:24.120
note.

232
00:10:24.120 --> 00:10:27.390
And this is essentially just a giant concussive force of energy that comes out

233
00:10:27.391 --> 00:10:30.930
of her mouth in the form of her voice. But what she's learned is that over,

234
00:10:30.931 --> 00:10:33.990
over time, it's not necessarily just like black folk, right?

235
00:10:33.991 --> 00:10:36.620
In the sense that when Blackbelt speaks, he's got a quasi Sonic. Great.

236
00:10:36.680 --> 00:10:39.320
So we cannot talk and not scream at the same time.

237
00:10:39.380 --> 00:10:42.290
The only way for him to do that is to like transition this essence to a

238
00:10:42.291 --> 00:10:45.500
different realm or for Dr. Strange to create some kind of pocket place where he

239
00:10:45.501 --> 00:10:48.290
can talk and his powers are neutralized or something along those lines.

240
00:10:48.320 --> 00:10:51.440
But if he's just walking mean down the street on earth or traveling anywhere

241
00:10:51.441 --> 00:10:54.560
within the normal universe in, in the main Marvel universe, if he talks,

242
00:10:54.590 --> 00:10:57.290
he's going to kill somebody with, with, uh, with Bay,

243
00:10:57.410 --> 00:10:59.270
what she learned is she has that power,

244
00:10:59.300 --> 00:11:02.090
but she can also talk at the same time so she can channel it at any point in

245
00:11:02.091 --> 00:11:02.420
time.

246
00:11:02.420 --> 00:11:06.950
So think of it like a vocal version of Cyclops is optic glass when he's wearing

247
00:11:06.951 --> 00:11:11.360
his optic visor, right. That he can look around when he has his optic visor on,

248
00:11:11.420 --> 00:11:13.850
but he can also channel his powers if he wants to at the same time,

249
00:11:13.910 --> 00:11:16.250
that's kind of how that works. And so because of this, uh,

250
00:11:16.280 --> 00:11:19.220
one of the things that goes on with this doom note is that it works a little

251
00:11:19.221 --> 00:11:21.320
uniquely with Doug Ramsey. And this sends a,

252
00:11:21.330 --> 00:11:23.900
Doug has the ability to understand any language,

253
00:11:23.930 --> 00:11:27.500
but he can't understand hers because hers is a language that doesn't exist

254
00:11:27.501 --> 00:11:29.570
within the main Marvel universe. Right? I mean, I guess it does,

255
00:11:29.630 --> 00:11:33.410
but a Rocco has been so far removed from anything in the main mobile universe.

256
00:11:33.440 --> 00:11:36.680
It's a language nobody in the universe has ever encountered before. And so,

257
00:11:36.681 --> 00:11:38.730
because of that, the do note itself, the,

258
00:11:38.740 --> 00:11:43.730
the kind of power in the voice of Bay desires to be understood what it wants to

259
00:11:43.731 --> 00:11:47.400
be, wants somebody to, to hear it and to understand what it's saying, but the,

260
00:11:47.401 --> 00:11:50.270
the words you speak, there's not really a true language and she cannot,

261
00:11:50.300 --> 00:11:51.800
it cannot really be translated.

262
00:11:51.830 --> 00:11:55.780
And so it was almost kind of like this vocal slash linguistics version of a,

263
00:11:55.840 --> 00:11:59.130
an immovable force meeting, an unstoppable object, that kind of a thing it's,

264
00:11:59.131 --> 00:12:01.780
it's kind of crazy, you know, with this, this, a little bit of a thing here,

265
00:12:01.781 --> 00:12:04.930
but the whole reason why they're being brought together is really kind of

266
00:12:04.931 --> 00:12:08.830
brought to bear when you have a magic visiting Doug and the two of them kind of

267
00:12:08.831 --> 00:12:10.690
start talking about what's going on. And he's like,

268
00:12:10.691 --> 00:12:13.000
I have no idea what's happening. Like what's, what's going on right here.

269
00:12:13.001 --> 00:12:15.700
And she's like, well, Brian's pretty inconsolable. He's pretty off.

270
00:12:15.910 --> 00:12:18.550
And everybody else's as well. Uh, they're just kind of, you know,

271
00:12:18.580 --> 00:12:21.070
mingling with the, the Iraqi people a little bit more,

272
00:12:21.071 --> 00:12:24.070
but no one really feels friendly towards this guy where they're all kind of off

273
00:12:24.071 --> 00:12:26.710
at her because she'd killed Betsy. But, uh, as the,

274
00:12:26.711 --> 00:12:31.210
as the doors open and they start to step in that Doug realizes, Oh my God, like,

275
00:12:31.240 --> 00:12:34.540
Bay's not going to kill me in a tournament. She's going to marry me. Like,

276
00:12:34.570 --> 00:12:36.820
it's literally a marriage has kind of been a symbol here.

277
00:12:36.821 --> 00:12:38.230
Now here's the funny thing about this, right?

278
00:12:38.500 --> 00:12:41.530
Teenie Howard plays this fast and loose. It's just kinda like, okay, like,

279
00:12:41.531 --> 00:12:43.870
Doug's like, all right, cool. I'm going to get married now. Here's the thing,

280
00:12:43.871 --> 00:12:46.510
man. Right? Like you see the two of them standing next to each other.

281
00:12:46.570 --> 00:12:49.480
This is a big woman. Right. And not in terms of, not in terms of girth,

282
00:12:49.510 --> 00:12:52.000
but just in terms of like physical size. She's like what?

283
00:12:52.030 --> 00:12:54.970
Maybe like two heads taller than, than Douglas Ramsey. Right.

284
00:12:54.971 --> 00:12:57.250
She's got maybe like a foot on him. All right. Let me tell you something cipher.

285
00:12:57.280 --> 00:12:59.080
She's going to make a man out of you, man.

286
00:13:01.650 --> 00:13:04.260
<v 2>Yes, she does. She's going to miss. She's gonna make a meal out of him.</v>

287
00:13:05.160 --> 00:13:07.470
<v 1>Better be ready. But, uh, but nonetheless,</v>

288
00:13:08.370 --> 00:13:11.430
this is kind of a crazy thing because the time comes for them to like make their

289
00:13:11.790 --> 00:13:13.950
doubts. And he's like, I mean, I didn't prepare any valves inside and he's like,

290
00:13:13.951 --> 00:13:15.930
well, then you better prepare them. You better, you better do a quick,

291
00:13:15.931 --> 00:13:19.800
fast in a hurry. And he actually makes these pretty amazing thousands of fly,

292
00:13:19.801 --> 00:13:21.150
right? He says, Bay, the blood moon, right?

293
00:13:21.151 --> 00:13:23.640
This is a little absurd because I don't know anything about you,

294
00:13:23.641 --> 00:13:24.990
but you're going to be my wife.

295
00:13:25.050 --> 00:13:29.040
So I swear to uphold my value for the duration of this challenge or whatever,

296
00:13:29.250 --> 00:13:30.330
however long it goes after.

297
00:13:30.390 --> 00:13:33.600
And I'll always be grateful that we got to do this instead of sword fight,

298
00:13:33.601 --> 00:13:35.160
because I'm not really ready.

299
00:13:35.160 --> 00:13:37.380
<v 2>To die. They're.</v>

300
00:13:37.380 --> 00:13:41.520
<v 1>Not bad bowels right now in response to that, uh, they offers her vows,</v>

301
00:13:41.550 --> 00:13:43.110
which are really good as well. Right?

302
00:13:43.111 --> 00:13:45.870
She says like when the grim fog of bloodshed overtakes us,

303
00:13:45.900 --> 00:13:48.810
the beloved is the beacon that returns us to our better selves.

304
00:13:48.840 --> 00:13:51.210
Love is a failed heat that cannot be broken.

305
00:13:51.300 --> 00:13:54.960
I will love you with a force of the wave that crashes the shore,

306
00:13:54.990 --> 00:13:57.630
like the current, the swallows, the sand, this is kind of cool.

307
00:13:57.690 --> 00:13:59.250
It's pretty interesting. And so he's kind of like on me,

308
00:13:59.251 --> 00:14:01.260
I don't really understand anything you said. It's just really,

309
00:14:01.261 --> 00:14:04.620
really fascinating. And then she, she fuels, she pulls back to Vail and uh,

310
00:14:04.640 --> 00:14:07.170
and Doug's like, man, she's super hot, right?

311
00:14:07.171 --> 00:14:10.080
So we just immediately swept up and how gorgeous this girl is.

312
00:14:10.081 --> 00:14:12.150
And so from there, like in the middle of this wedding,

313
00:14:12.180 --> 00:14:13.860
fire just goes everywhere.

314
00:14:15.840 --> 00:14:16.380
<v 2>Fire.</v>

315
00:14:16.380 --> 00:14:20.040
<v 1>Just gets sprayed everywhere. And here comes Jubilee, riding show go.</v>

316
00:14:20.100 --> 00:14:22.770
And everybody's like, Jubilee, what are you doing? Like,

317
00:14:22.860 --> 00:14:25.350
what are you doing here? Like you're flying in here with a dragon.

318
00:14:25.351 --> 00:14:28.470
Like here comes a clue. Trains. You believe the last stop is you.

319
00:14:28.530 --> 00:14:32.940
This is not a good idea. You should not do this.

320
00:14:32.970 --> 00:14:36.450
You should not fly in here with a dragon and start breathing fire everywhere.

321
00:14:36.451 --> 00:14:38.580
But you believe like, well, I told Brett I Betsy Bradley,

322
00:14:38.680 --> 00:14:39.870
but I didn't hear from her by 12.

323
00:14:39.900 --> 00:14:41.730
Did I come over here and see what's going on now?

324
00:14:41.731 --> 00:14:44.280
Here's the crazy thing about this is keep in mind, show goes,

325
00:14:44.281 --> 00:14:48.240
dragon fire in other world has the ability to melt that reality. Right?

326
00:14:48.241 --> 00:14:52.610
He can literally destroy the physical principles that reality. And so when,

327
00:14:52.611 --> 00:14:54.650
when you have, you know, Wolverine, who's kind of like, Hey man,

328
00:14:54.770 --> 00:14:55.190
it's kind of cool.

329
00:14:55.190 --> 00:14:57.020
This Dragon's coming here and he's going to burn the place down.

330
00:14:57.050 --> 00:15:00.380
The response of apocalypse is no, that's not cool at all. Wolverine.

331
00:15:00.381 --> 00:15:03.800
That is not by any means a cool thing. I mean maybe a little bit.

332
00:15:03.830 --> 00:15:05.750
Maybe it's like a little bit cool, but it's not,

333
00:15:05.990 --> 00:15:07.580
it's cool as you're making it out to be right,

334
00:15:07.581 --> 00:15:11.150
because this dragon will destroy the reality in which we live. Right.

335
00:15:11.151 --> 00:15:12.950
And we will all perish along with it. Right.

336
00:15:12.951 --> 00:15:15.950
So killing us is the least of what this dragon can do.

337
00:15:15.951 --> 00:15:17.870
It's kind of a cool little, a cool little thing there now,

338
00:15:17.930 --> 00:15:21.170
while all that's going on, a cipher is kind of like, okay,

339
00:15:21.171 --> 00:15:23.010
like he's talking to babies, like, are you gonna go out there? And she's,

340
00:15:23.120 --> 00:15:24.230
and she doesn't really say anything where he's like,

341
00:15:24.231 --> 00:15:25.790
are you really going to go out there? And you really gonna,

342
00:15:25.800 --> 00:15:28.820
you really gonna do all this? I mean, if you do, here's the thing, like,

343
00:15:28.821 --> 00:15:31.360
don't kill, like, don't kill the dragon. The Dragon's cool.

344
00:15:31.460 --> 00:15:32.960
It's like a little baby, right? Like the Dragon's cool.

345
00:15:32.961 --> 00:15:35.750
Like don't kill the dragon. She immediately turns around and kisses him. Right.

346
00:15:35.751 --> 00:15:37.640
So here's, here's what I'm going to bet. Right? I'm going,

347
00:15:37.660 --> 00:15:40.430
I'm going to bet this here and I'll tell you what, if I'm wrong,

348
00:15:40.520 --> 00:15:43.010
I will give out three Rob Porex right.

349
00:15:43.040 --> 00:15:45.920
I will give three Rob core rings for free, which by the way,

350
00:15:45.980 --> 00:15:47.980
fully got your asking. Ah, we're going to start selling it.

351
00:15:48.050 --> 00:15:49.460
I'll make an announcement later, but I'll give out three,

352
00:15:49.700 --> 00:15:50.533
Rob four rings for free.

353
00:15:50.570 --> 00:15:54.320
What I'm willing to bet here is that the time's going to come when it's time for

354
00:15:54.650 --> 00:15:55.130
cipher to fight.

355
00:15:55.130 --> 00:15:58.580
And she's going to fight in his stead and every single match that he has,

356
00:15:58.610 --> 00:16:01.040
that I doubt the two of them are actually going to have to fight each other.

357
00:16:01.040 --> 00:16:03.890
And if they do have to fight each other, she'll sacrifice her life for him.

358
00:16:03.980 --> 00:16:06.320
And then cypher will basically be the one who wins the tournament.

359
00:16:06.350 --> 00:16:09.050
He'll come out on top and he'll be the one that saves, saves for color.

360
00:16:09.080 --> 00:16:12.980
I will bet that I will bet that's exactly what happens. I don't know if it is,

361
00:16:13.010 --> 00:16:14.630
but I will bet that's what happens now.

362
00:16:14.660 --> 00:16:17.330
The cool thing is that one Saturday and shows up here and realizes what's going

363
00:16:17.331 --> 00:16:21.800
on. She's, right? She's she's eight kinds of off. I just, jeez,

364
00:16:21.950 --> 00:16:26.720
she's mad as hell when she comes, she comes walking out here and she's like,

365
00:16:26.750 --> 00:16:30.440
no, like this is not gonna fly. And, and it's one of the, well, no pun intended,

366
00:16:30.500 --> 00:16:33.110
but it's one of those things where like, she almost intends to destroy it,

367
00:16:33.260 --> 00:16:36.380
but then you have wool Raider kind of times then like that baby's going to hurt

368
00:16:36.381 --> 00:16:39.350
storm. Right. And that's when Saturday realizes, Oh, that's right, it's a baby.

369
00:16:39.380 --> 00:16:42.180
So she uses her magic and then manipulates the mind of,

370
00:16:42.181 --> 00:16:45.680
of Chicago and we're to bring him to her and bring them under her spell. Right.

371
00:16:45.681 --> 00:16:47.810
She also kind of dissipates his dragon fire.

372
00:16:47.811 --> 00:16:50.150
So it can't really destroy anything inside of a,

373
00:16:50.750 --> 00:16:51.530
anything inside of other worlds.

374
00:16:51.530 --> 00:16:54.080
But it's one of these things where she makes this comment where she was like,

375
00:16:54.081 --> 00:16:56.390
you know, it's lucky that I'm in a good mood today, right?

376
00:16:56.391 --> 00:16:59.150
Because if you had actually flown Jubilee here,

377
00:16:59.240 --> 00:17:00.860
I would have killed her in front of everybody.

378
00:17:01.100 --> 00:17:03.680
But I would have killed her in front of every single person here as it was a

379
00:17:03.681 --> 00:17:06.020
little bit, a little bit nuts because from there, you know,

380
00:17:06.021 --> 00:17:08.780
once everything kind of settles down that it's like, okay, she's like,

381
00:17:08.781 --> 00:17:12.020
I'm in a good mood, but I got my drinks. We got a wedding, we have cake, right.

382
00:17:12.260 --> 00:17:15.350
One point for each side, right? Like one point for each person.

383
00:17:15.410 --> 00:17:15.890
And that's where.

384
00:17:15.890 --> 00:17:18.140
<v 3>It ends. So.</v>

385
00:17:18.140 --> 00:17:22.250
<v 1>In the first match, right, the first day of this battle, which I won't even lie,</v>

386
00:17:22.251 --> 00:17:25.670
this story kind of went off the rails. And the first day of this battle, ah,

387
00:17:25.850 --> 00:17:27.950
Betsy Bradick died in two hits. And uh,

388
00:17:27.951 --> 00:17:31.160
really just with one hit and cipher got married to a Chicky doesn't know.

389
00:17:31.190 --> 00:17:35.150
So yeah, that's kind of where we are now. Here's the crazy thing about this.

390
00:17:35.240 --> 00:17:37.520
It's only gonna get crazier over that being said, guys,

391
00:17:37.521 --> 00:17:38.600
we're gonna bring this video to an end.

392
00:17:38.720 --> 00:17:40.160
If you are new here to come and explain it,

393
00:17:40.161 --> 00:17:42.290
make sure you guys have the sub button to become part of the Rob core.

394
00:17:42.291 --> 00:17:44.360
If you guys enjoyed this video, make sure you drop a line.

395
00:17:44.410 --> 00:17:47.710
<v 3>Mike. I know we'll catch you all later, Bruce.</v>

396
00:19:13.290 --> 00:19:13.290
<v 4>[Inaudible].</v>
