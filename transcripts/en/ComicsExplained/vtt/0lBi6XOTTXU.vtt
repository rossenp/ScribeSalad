guys hit the like button, if you enjoyed the video and yeah, let's begin.

4
00:00:11.100 --> 00:00:12.350
All right. What's going on guys. This is.

5
00:00:12.470 --> 00:00:15.920
<v 1>Rob and we are picking back up again with the three jokers. Yes.</v>

6
00:00:15.950 --> 00:00:19.130
This is the conclusion to the three jokers storyline. Right?

7
00:00:19.131 --> 00:00:20.960
Keep in mind that one of the jokers is dead.

8
00:00:21.020 --> 00:00:24.050
The clown joker is the one that was killed by, by Jason Todd,

9
00:00:24.140 --> 00:00:27.830
the criminal and the comedian are still alive. But in this video,

10
00:00:27.860 --> 00:00:31.400
we are going to find out which one of these jokers is the real joker.

11
00:00:31.430 --> 00:00:34.250
And it's amazing. It's such a great review.

12
00:00:34.310 --> 00:00:37.370
So initially this kind of picks up with like Batman and Jason,

13
00:00:37.371 --> 00:00:40.670
Todd and Barbara Gordon kind of conversing right about all the information that

14
00:00:40.671 --> 00:00:41.970
they've seen. Right. You know,

15
00:00:42.080 --> 00:00:44.360
the information that was kind of brought together and the fact that the joker

16
00:00:44.361 --> 00:00:47.390
wanted them to find all this stuff, right? The three jokers, one of these guys,

17
00:00:47.391 --> 00:00:49.940
one of these, these three to find all these things that are here.

18
00:00:49.970 --> 00:00:53.120
And so one of the things that that was kind of established in the last video is

19
00:00:53.121 --> 00:00:54.770
that the jokers are created.

20
00:00:55.100 --> 00:00:58.790
Two of these jokers were artificially created in the sense that we have one main

21
00:00:58.791 --> 00:01:00.740
joker and then he created the other two.

22
00:01:00.800 --> 00:01:04.850
And so the idea is that if that's true and the question is which joker is the

23
00:01:04.851 --> 00:01:06.240
real one, right? And that's really where,

24
00:01:06.460 --> 00:01:07.520
whether where they're trying to figure out.

25
00:01:07.550 --> 00:01:11.240
And one of the things that Jason Todd says is whichever joker is the real joker.

26
00:01:11.270 --> 00:01:14.090
Once I find them, like once I set my sights on him, there'll be no jokers.

27
00:01:14.091 --> 00:01:16.670
I'm going to kill him because you're too weak to do it Batman.

28
00:01:16.671 --> 00:01:18.650
And when that happens, Bruce Wayne freaks out, right?

29
00:01:18.651 --> 00:01:21.530
Like he immediately loses it and starts going after Jason, Todd.

30
00:01:21.590 --> 00:01:23.420
And the reason why, and this, this is what's so cool.

31
00:01:23.440 --> 00:01:24.920
I'm gonna be honest with you guys. This is what's so cool.

32
00:01:24.980 --> 00:01:27.710
I think this is the best that Jason Todd's been written in years.

33
00:01:27.711 --> 00:01:29.390
I'm just going to say it. But one of the things that, that,

34
00:01:29.420 --> 00:01:31.850
that man gets out about up his off about is like,

35
00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:33.740
do you really think that I haven't wanted to put a,

36
00:01:33.770 --> 00:01:35.730
put a bullet in the brain of the joker, right?

37
00:01:35.731 --> 00:01:38.720
Do you think I really didn't want to kill him after everything that he did after

38
00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:41.780
he, what he did to you after what he did to Barbara, do you really think,

39
00:01:41.810 --> 00:01:44.420
I didn't want to? And the response of Jason Todd is,

40
00:01:44.421 --> 00:01:47.960
but you didn't have all the talk that you have. You didn't do it. You wanted to,

41
00:01:48.080 --> 00:01:50.960
you could have, but you didn't. And that's one of the things that's interesting,

42
00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:51.231
right?

43
00:01:51.231 --> 00:01:53.540
Like whenever I make this point about how Batman should kill his villains,

44
00:01:53.570 --> 00:01:56.210
people usually kind of default to the slippery slope argument.

45
00:01:56.240 --> 00:01:59.540
I never really consider that a good argument. It's a fallacy because one,

46
00:01:59.541 --> 00:02:01.730
it assumes that you can't control yourself. Right?

47
00:02:01.850 --> 00:02:04.040
You'd assume that you can't say like, I'm just going to stop here.

48
00:02:04.070 --> 00:02:06.860
The problem with the slippery slope argument is that if you apply it to across

49
00:02:06.861 --> 00:02:07.970
the board and you say, okay,

50
00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:11.180
let's apply this slippery slope argument to anything, then we can say, okay,

51
00:02:11.210 --> 00:02:14.150
you should never have a single drink of alcohol in your life. Because if you do,

52
00:02:14.210 --> 00:02:16.460
it's a slippery slope and you'll become an alcoholic.

53
00:02:16.490 --> 00:02:18.980
You should never smoke weed once in your life. Because if you do,

54
00:02:19.010 --> 00:02:21.320
it's a slippery slope and you'll become a drug addict, right?

55
00:02:21.350 --> 00:02:23.450
That's the problem with the slippery slope argument, right?

56
00:02:23.451 --> 00:02:26.660
It assumes that Batman couldn't sit down and reason and say, okay,

57
00:02:26.690 --> 00:02:30.170
of all the villains that I have joker is by and far the worst,

58
00:02:30.171 --> 00:02:32.120
because he just kills people, indiscriminately,

59
00:02:32.121 --> 00:02:34.370
for reasons that don't make sense to anybody but himself,

60
00:02:34.400 --> 00:02:36.830
but has something to do with the fact that he wants me to come and find him.

61
00:02:36.860 --> 00:02:38.750
And for every time I captured the joker,

62
00:02:38.751 --> 00:02:40.550
he'll kill a hundred people before I get him.

63
00:02:40.610 --> 00:02:43.940
So we should just kill him and be done with it. It assumes Batman.

64
00:02:43.941 --> 00:02:47.570
Can't define that reason, right? Batman can't say, okay, killing the joker.

65
00:02:47.630 --> 00:02:49.100
That's basically where it stops. Right?

66
00:02:49.101 --> 00:02:52.820
I can't justify killing the penguin or anybody like that because they're just,

67
00:02:53.090 --> 00:02:54.860
they're they're criminals, right? They do some pretty shady stuff,

68
00:02:54.890 --> 00:02:58.040
but nobody's as bad as the joker is for the world's greatest detective.

69
00:02:58.070 --> 00:03:01.900
I have a hard time believing. He'd be unable to stop at that line of logic.

70
00:03:01.930 --> 00:03:05.800
So that's why I never really paid any attention to the slippery slope argument

71
00:03:05.920 --> 00:03:08.560
and just kind of ignored it because it's the argument you make when you can't

72
00:03:08.561 --> 00:03:09.640
make any other argument.

73
00:03:09.670 --> 00:03:13.000
But the crazy thing about this is that Batman basically says like you don't

74
00:03:13.001 --> 00:03:13.750
understand, right?

75
00:03:13.750 --> 00:03:16.210
Barbara Gordon tries to step in and kind of mediate things a little bit.

76
00:03:16.240 --> 00:03:18.760
But at the end of the day, they're both ignoring her. It's Jason, Todd,

77
00:03:18.761 --> 00:03:22.230
and Batman. And at the end of the day, Batman's like, you don't understand you.

78
00:03:22.231 --> 00:03:25.690
You never have understood Batman. Doesn't say it in so many words,

79
00:03:25.720 --> 00:03:29.140
but Jason Todd does not understand the effect it had on Bruce Wayne.

80
00:03:29.170 --> 00:03:32.380
And the reason why is because their children to persuade they're his kids.

81
00:03:32.590 --> 00:03:33.560
That's just, that's, that's the,

82
00:03:33.561 --> 00:03:36.310
that's just the plain and simple statement of the fact, right? Sure.

83
00:03:36.311 --> 00:03:38.410
Barbara Gordon has her dad, right? She's got commissioner Gordon,

84
00:03:38.470 --> 00:03:41.710
but Batman sees them as children, especially Jason, Todd, Tim Drake,

85
00:03:41.740 --> 00:03:43.890
and Dick Grayson there's kids. Like he would,

86
00:03:43.891 --> 00:03:46.240
he took them on his wards by all standards of measurement.

87
00:03:46.241 --> 00:03:47.950
He was their father or father figure.

88
00:03:48.010 --> 00:03:50.440
And he was there to make sure that no harm befell them.

89
00:03:50.500 --> 00:03:52.720
He knew the risk that he was taking here,

90
00:03:52.750 --> 00:03:56.110
but he also understood that they needed to have an outlet for their anger and

91
00:03:56.111 --> 00:04:00.310
their visions and their desire to destroy. They needed a good way to channel it.

92
00:04:00.480 --> 00:04:02.350
And, and the best way to channel it is to one,

93
00:04:02.410 --> 00:04:04.630
allow them to help him on his missions. But to,

94
00:04:04.631 --> 00:04:09.100
to curb that desire for revenge into a desire to make people's lives better.

95
00:04:09.160 --> 00:04:11.770
And so, along the way, Jason, Todd kind of seemed to have gotten lost,

96
00:04:11.771 --> 00:04:13.030
but Jason Todd was beaten to death.

97
00:04:13.060 --> 00:04:16.390
And when Jason Todd came back and he was so angry at Batman because Batman

98
00:04:16.391 --> 00:04:18.310
didn't kill the joker Batman wanted to,

99
00:04:18.370 --> 00:04:20.920
but he didn't because in his mind it wasn't the right thing to do.

100
00:04:20.980 --> 00:04:24.050
And so the results of this is that you kind of have this little bit of a

101
00:04:24.130 --> 00:04:26.980
breakdown, right? The Batman runs over the criminal joker and says,

102
00:04:26.981 --> 00:04:29.290
he's very reminiscent of the joker from the early days.

103
00:04:29.320 --> 00:04:31.480
Like the old Bob Kane bill finger joker, right?

104
00:04:31.481 --> 00:04:34.150
Like the guy who was just really sadistic, really dark the clown.

105
00:04:34.151 --> 00:04:36.520
Of course they face it, the aquarium and Jason Todd killed him.

106
00:04:36.550 --> 00:04:39.610
The comedian is the one where you see him laugh,

107
00:04:39.640 --> 00:04:41.530
but there's just something there, right?

108
00:04:41.531 --> 00:04:43.030
There's just kind of like this darkness,

109
00:04:43.210 --> 00:04:46.630
this dark sadistic streak behind the laugh and the smile and the eyes,

110
00:04:46.780 --> 00:04:48.910
it just shows this guy is the worst of them all.

111
00:04:48.970 --> 00:04:52.660
He's the absolute worst of the jokers, the most violent of all the jokers.

112
00:04:52.690 --> 00:04:56.800
And so because of that, it's okay. One of these three is the original joker.

113
00:04:56.860 --> 00:04:58.360
Maybe we already killed them in the aquarium.

114
00:04:58.420 --> 00:05:01.150
Maybe it's the criminal mastermind. Maybe it's the comedian, right.

115
00:05:01.151 --> 00:05:03.880
Maybe it's the most, the district of the mall. But whichever one, it is,

116
00:05:03.970 --> 00:05:07.360
one of them is the real joker is the question of Barbara Gordon is maybe we

117
00:05:07.361 --> 00:05:10.810
finally find out, well, maybe we find out the true origin of the joker.

118
00:05:10.870 --> 00:05:12.520
And at the end of the day, like Jason, Todd is like,

119
00:05:12.521 --> 00:05:14.080
maybe just some kind of a nobody. Right.

120
00:05:14.110 --> 00:05:19.000
But where the questions asked like Batman, do you know who the joker is? Right?

121
00:05:19.001 --> 00:05:22.360
Like, do you know his name? Irresponsive Bruce is no. If I did know,

122
00:05:22.361 --> 00:05:23.440
I would have told you already.

123
00:05:23.500 --> 00:05:26.440
And so what you end up doing is picking up in the aftermath of Joe Hill being

124
00:05:26.441 --> 00:05:28.000
kidnapped. Right? We saw that in the,

125
00:05:28.001 --> 00:05:30.580
in the last video that we did in the last comic that we did that Joe chill was

126
00:05:30.581 --> 00:05:33.490
kidnapped from black gate prison while he was basically going through medical

127
00:05:33.491 --> 00:05:35.590
treatment and Batman immediately wants to see a cell.

128
00:05:35.591 --> 00:05:38.380
Now here's the crazy thing is Batman's going through these,

129
00:05:38.381 --> 00:05:42.010
these kind of books that were in the cell of Joe till he came across letters

130
00:05:42.040 --> 00:05:44.500
that Joe chil wrote, and none of the letters were ever mailed out,

131
00:05:44.530 --> 00:05:47.020
but they were all made out to Bruce Wayne. And so where he,

132
00:05:47.180 --> 00:05:49.360
he basically ends up going to see Reverend Evans, right?

133
00:05:49.361 --> 00:05:51.970
The guy who essentially runs the show, kind of, you know, this, this priest,

134
00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:54.730
you know, who helps them find repentance of their, that he's not the warden,

135
00:05:54.760 --> 00:05:57.590
but the person that helps them basically helps prisoners kind discover who they

136
00:05:57.591 --> 00:06:00.770
really are or allows them to repent or whatever the case is that when Batman is

137
00:06:00.771 --> 00:06:03.110
talking to him, he basically says, you know, he says, no,

138
00:06:03.111 --> 00:06:05.810
like these letters were never nailed because they were never finished. You know,

139
00:06:05.930 --> 00:06:08.870
he dropped out of school when he was 13 and he was doing his best in his classes

140
00:06:08.871 --> 00:06:11.240
here, but his learning disabilities slowed him down. Right.

141
00:06:11.241 --> 00:06:14.630
His inability to read at an effective rate, you know, at an effective level.

142
00:06:14.660 --> 00:06:18.440
And that these letters that he wrote were long before he became ill,

143
00:06:18.470 --> 00:06:21.380
because the thought of Batman and he kind of went down and wants to deviate to

144
00:06:21.381 --> 00:06:24.440
the idea that Joe chill is still just a bad person. It comforts him.

145
00:06:24.500 --> 00:06:26.000
And that's why Batman says, okay.

146
00:06:26.001 --> 00:06:28.760
So if the whole reason he wrote these letters is because he got sick and he just

147
00:06:28.761 --> 00:06:30.200
wanted to, he wanted to repent, right?

148
00:06:30.201 --> 00:06:32.180
Like he wanted to make sure he didn't go to hell when he died.

149
00:06:32.240 --> 00:06:34.360
And the responsive of Reverend Evans. No,

150
00:06:34.390 --> 00:06:38.440
he wrote those long before he fell ill a long time ago. He felt ill.

151
00:06:38.470 --> 00:06:41.170
Now the other part of this is you pick up with Barbara Gordon and you pick up

152
00:06:41.171 --> 00:06:41.470
with,

153
00:06:41.470 --> 00:06:45.130
with Dick Grayson while Batman's inside talking to the Reverend and Dick race.

154
00:06:45.210 --> 00:06:47.620
And initially kind of hits up Barbara Gordon and says, look, uh, you know,

155
00:06:47.621 --> 00:06:49.300
I know I kind of screwed up here, right? Like,

156
00:06:49.450 --> 00:06:52.030
I've put you guys in a rough position, but at the end of the day,

157
00:06:52.031 --> 00:06:54.750
he also tells her like we won't ever have anything like that again. And it's,

158
00:06:54.751 --> 00:06:57.160
it's kind of an important thing here because it gives us a little bit of a

159
00:06:57.161 --> 00:06:59.350
softer side of, of Jason Todd.

160
00:06:59.410 --> 00:07:02.800
And so it's a little bit nuts there because the question that Reverend has is

161
00:07:02.860 --> 00:07:06.160
what do they want with him? What, like, why take Joe chill in the first place?

162
00:07:06.161 --> 00:07:09.880
Right. He's a dying man. Like he literally has cancer. His days are numbered.

163
00:07:09.940 --> 00:07:10.930
And he basically says like,

164
00:07:10.960 --> 00:07:13.870
I'm going to find out because what he finds among all these letters,

165
00:07:13.990 --> 00:07:16.090
as one that was obviously written by the joker,

166
00:07:16.120 --> 00:07:19.980
and it basically has a ticket to the Mark of Zorro. And so again, that's at the,

167
00:07:19.981 --> 00:07:21.160
the Monarch theater.

168
00:07:21.190 --> 00:07:23.560
That was the show that Batman and his parents are Bruce Wayne.

169
00:07:23.561 --> 00:07:26.500
His parents were going to see when they died or had seen when they died.

170
00:07:26.530 --> 00:07:29.050
And so of course, Barbara Gordon and Bruce Wayne and,

171
00:07:29.051 --> 00:07:31.240
and Jason Todd showed up here and this begins,

172
00:07:31.241 --> 00:07:35.560
what's probably the single greatest point in this whole story. Well,

173
00:07:35.580 --> 00:07:39.580
greatest moment in this entire story that when you have him show up,

174
00:07:39.640 --> 00:07:41.780
a movie begins to play. And this movie is,

175
00:07:41.781 --> 00:07:45.370
is basically like the comedian joker talking to Joe chill and saying, okay,

176
00:07:45.371 --> 00:07:47.170
kind of picking up where we left off in the last one.

177
00:07:47.260 --> 00:07:50.920
Why did you really kill Thomas and Martha Wayne? I've read all your letters.

178
00:07:50.950 --> 00:07:53.740
I've read the ministers. No, you've seen the light, right? Your,

179
00:07:53.741 --> 00:07:57.730
your experiences and the suffering that you cause have, have touched your soul.

180
00:07:57.790 --> 00:07:59.260
They've touched your immortal soul.

181
00:07:59.290 --> 00:08:03.430
And you have looked to repent all of your sins, but answer something for me.

182
00:08:03.490 --> 00:08:07.210
Why did you kill Thomas and Martha Wayne? Really?

183
00:08:07.240 --> 00:08:08.890
What was the motivation behind it? Now,

184
00:08:08.891 --> 00:08:11.620
Batman of course ends up kind of making his way through the theater as this

185
00:08:12.010 --> 00:08:14.170
movies playing. And then finally comes across judge Hill.

186
00:08:14.380 --> 00:08:15.850
Who's currently being held by the criminals.

187
00:08:15.910 --> 00:08:20.170
And this is cool because the criminal is not being written as like a crazy goofy

188
00:08:20.350 --> 00:08:20.830
guy. Right?

189
00:08:20.830 --> 00:08:23.500
That was one of the cool things about his character is he's methodical.

190
00:08:23.530 --> 00:08:27.460
He thinks he focuses that he, that it hurts him to laugh,

191
00:08:27.490 --> 00:08:30.190
which I think is probably one of the greatest additions to the joker mythos

192
00:08:30.340 --> 00:08:30.700
ever.

193
00:08:30.700 --> 00:08:35.260
But what he says here is their initial intention was to turn Jason Todd into the

194
00:08:35.261 --> 00:08:39.310
new joker. But the problem with that is that Jason Todd lacks sophistication,

195
00:08:39.370 --> 00:08:42.040
and then they were going to take Barbara Gordon, but she's got too much heart,

196
00:08:42.070 --> 00:08:44.650
right? So he picked the killer. Uh, he picked Joe Hill.

197
00:08:44.680 --> 00:08:47.620
The intention is to turn Joe chill into a new joker.

198
00:08:47.650 --> 00:08:50.320
And it's one of the things that's kind of nuts here is because while this little

199
00:08:50.321 --> 00:08:53.950
bit of a segment's happening between criminal joker in between, you know,

200
00:08:53.951 --> 00:08:54.520
Batman,

201
00:08:54.520 --> 00:08:57.960
that you've also got the comedian joker doing that interview with Joe chill,

202
00:08:57.961 --> 00:08:58.680
and then they record it.

203
00:08:58.680 --> 00:09:01.650
And they're putting on the movie screen and George Hill to kind of nip this in

204
00:09:01.651 --> 00:09:04.200
the bud real quick. So we can kind of focus on the meat and potatoes of this.

205
00:09:04.230 --> 00:09:04.831
Joe chill.

206
00:09:04.831 --> 00:09:08.130
The reason why he killed Thomas and Martha Wayne is because he was struggling.

207
00:09:08.131 --> 00:09:10.170
He was down on his luck and he saw them.

208
00:09:10.171 --> 00:09:13.650
And he believed that people who were that rich are the reason why he was that

209
00:09:13.651 --> 00:09:14.850
poor. It was their fault.

210
00:09:14.880 --> 00:09:18.840
And so he wanted to take some of what they had in order to get himself back on

211
00:09:18.841 --> 00:09:19.674
his feet again.

212
00:09:19.770 --> 00:09:23.070
And the result of that was that once he got there and once he essentially went

213
00:09:23.071 --> 00:09:25.860
to go Rob them, he suddenly realized that Bruce Wayne's there.

214
00:09:25.890 --> 00:09:29.160
And before he knew it, the gun was going off, right? The gun was going off.

215
00:09:29.190 --> 00:09:30.900
And the result was that they were basically killed,

216
00:09:30.930 --> 00:09:33.630
but it wasn't until after everything that was going on.

217
00:09:33.660 --> 00:09:35.610
Did he realize that Thomas and Martha Wayne,

218
00:09:35.611 --> 00:09:36.870
which he already knew who they were,

219
00:09:36.900 --> 00:09:39.660
but they were actually people who were using their money to make Gotham city

220
00:09:39.661 --> 00:09:40.110
better.

221
00:09:40.110 --> 00:09:43.560
But they were looking to work against those individuals who use their wealth to

222
00:09:43.561 --> 00:09:46.800
buy politicians, to make laws in their favor, things like that.

223
00:09:46.830 --> 00:09:49.920
They were the good guys and he killed two people who were actually looking to

224
00:09:49.921 --> 00:09:51.930
make Gotham better, who could have made his life better,

225
00:09:51.960 --> 00:09:54.000
but in his anger and in his selfishness,

226
00:09:54.030 --> 00:09:55.890
he kind of categorized them all the same.

227
00:09:55.980 --> 00:09:58.920
Everybody out there who's rich is the reason why I'm poor, right?

228
00:09:59.130 --> 00:10:03.000
And there really isn't a direct corollary between those two things.

229
00:10:03.060 --> 00:10:05.880
It's not necessarily because somebody is rich, you are poor, right?

230
00:10:05.881 --> 00:10:08.610
It's not necessarily that way, but Joe Hill saw it that way.

231
00:10:08.640 --> 00:10:10.710
And that's what led him to committing the act that he debt.

232
00:10:10.740 --> 00:10:13.860
Now that admission will become much more important later on down the line.

233
00:10:13.890 --> 00:10:17.730
But Batman initially approaches Joe chill with the intention of Framingham and

234
00:10:17.731 --> 00:10:20.550
criminal joker reveals. He's got his whole chest strap with dynamite.

235
00:10:20.580 --> 00:10:23.010
Now that's a classic move for the criminal joker.

236
00:10:23.040 --> 00:10:26.520
If you go back and you read the old, uh, the old Bob Kane bill finger stories,

237
00:10:26.521 --> 00:10:28.620
right? Do you ever get your chance? You know, you can, you can buy them on.

238
00:10:28.621 --> 00:10:31.940
I think you can buy them directly from DC, or you can grab on Comixology.

239
00:10:31.990 --> 00:10:35.610
You can go read those super old Batman stories, right? Batman number one,

240
00:10:35.611 --> 00:10:37.980
number two, number three, go read those really old stories with the joker.

241
00:10:38.040 --> 00:10:41.250
And that's the kind of stuff he would do. And so you end up having, you know,

242
00:10:41.310 --> 00:10:45.180
Barbara Gordon and Jason Todd facing off against like these kind of joke,

243
00:10:45.480 --> 00:10:47.850
arise people, right? These, these joke arise, individuals who are out there,

244
00:10:47.880 --> 00:10:49.800
but as Barbara Gordon is facing off against a couple of them,

245
00:10:49.830 --> 00:10:52.890
they both get shot. And when she initially believes it's Jason Todd,

246
00:10:52.891 --> 00:10:56.190
she turns around and is the comedian joker, the one who shot her, right?

247
00:10:56.191 --> 00:10:58.290
The one who shot her from killing joke to steel wheeling,

248
00:10:58.320 --> 00:11:00.630
that same camera that he had his outfits different,

249
00:11:00.660 --> 00:11:03.540
but he's still got the same camera and he's like time for you to smile.

250
00:11:03.541 --> 00:11:05.910
And so it was like a great tribute to the killing joke, right?

251
00:11:05.911 --> 00:11:08.130
It's like an amazing tribute to the killing joke. And so the,

252
00:11:08.131 --> 00:11:12.450
the motivation behind creating a new joker and even the motivation behind the

253
00:11:12.451 --> 00:11:15.750
creation of these jokers is revealed when the criminal tells Batman,

254
00:11:15.780 --> 00:11:19.290
he wants to be more, he needs to be everything to Batman.

255
00:11:19.320 --> 00:11:23.190
The biggest issue that he has with Batman is he's not his main focus.

256
00:11:23.250 --> 00:11:25.800
Now that's a, that's a common point that Joker's had over the years.

257
00:11:25.830 --> 00:11:27.840
It's not something Jeff Johns is making up on the spot.

258
00:11:27.870 --> 00:11:31.290
That's been the motivation behind joker for years for eons and eons and eons

259
00:11:31.320 --> 00:11:33.270
that he wants to be. The one that Batman focuses on.

260
00:11:33.271 --> 00:11:34.980
He wants to be the center of Batman's life.

261
00:11:35.010 --> 00:11:37.500
He almost in kind of a sadistic and screwed up legs.

262
00:11:37.680 --> 00:11:40.110
He's Batman is like a lover is a dissatisfaction, right?

263
00:11:40.111 --> 00:11:42.630
The fact that he doesn't have Batman focusing on him in that way,

264
00:11:42.690 --> 00:11:46.830
leaves him dissatisfied. And so initially that his response is Joe chose a sick,

265
00:11:46.831 --> 00:11:49.140
dying old man of what use would he be to you?

266
00:11:49.200 --> 00:11:50.760
And that's when criminal joker says,

267
00:11:50.820 --> 00:11:53.920
I'm willing to bet that this little bath will put them into remission.

268
00:11:53.980 --> 00:11:57.400
I'm willing to bet if we don't come in this water that is going to cure his

269
00:11:57.401 --> 00:11:58.930
cancer, it'll make him insane,

270
00:11:58.960 --> 00:12:02.020
but it'll cure his cancer and he will be one of us.

271
00:12:02.050 --> 00:12:03.820
And that's kind of the crazy thing here, right?

272
00:12:03.840 --> 00:12:05.410
That's kind of the crazy situation,

273
00:12:05.500 --> 00:12:09.790
because right now this criminal joker defines the concept of the joker as an

274
00:12:09.820 --> 00:12:12.370
undefined chaos. We're just absolute chaos.

275
00:12:12.400 --> 00:12:14.530
There's no rhyme and reason to us be like,

276
00:12:14.531 --> 00:12:17.200
you don't see us as like a form and a function, right?

277
00:12:17.201 --> 00:12:20.890
You don't see us as we truly are, that we are the antithesis to you. Instead,

278
00:12:20.891 --> 00:12:24.430
you see us as just like crazy guys who implement some schemes and do some things

279
00:12:24.431 --> 00:12:27.280
and I'll help hops off for a little while. And then things go back to normal,

280
00:12:27.310 --> 00:12:29.740
right? Like you capture us and then we go to jail and that's basically it,

281
00:12:29.770 --> 00:12:33.700
but I need to be more, we as a joker need to be more. And so at that point,

282
00:12:33.701 --> 00:12:36.730
like literally joker pulls out a Tommy gun goes to shoe Batman, of course,

283
00:12:36.731 --> 00:12:39.850
Batman Dodgers, out of the way. But in the process, the robes start to snap.

284
00:12:39.880 --> 00:12:42.340
The joker falls, the lighter falls out of his hand and ends up,

285
00:12:42.790 --> 00:12:45.730
ends up landing in this VAT of chemicals, which of course turns us this great,

286
00:12:45.850 --> 00:12:48.640
big, huge chemical thing on fire. And so in that moment, when,

287
00:12:48.641 --> 00:12:51.760
when criminal joker goes to fight Bruce Wayne, you've also got, uh,

288
00:12:51.790 --> 00:12:54.010
the comedian joker facing off against Barbara Gordon.

289
00:12:54.011 --> 00:12:56.770
And it's just kind of like, I've never, I haven't had this much fun in a long,

290
00:12:56.771 --> 00:12:58.810
long time and we're just getting started.

291
00:12:58.811 --> 00:13:01.910
And when part of the roof begins to collapse and it doesn't quite kill Barbara

292
00:13:01.910 --> 00:13:03.610
Gordon then, but when part of the roof starts to collapse,

293
00:13:03.640 --> 00:13:06.100
the comedian ends up bailing out, right. He ends up taking off.

294
00:13:06.160 --> 00:13:08.890
And so you've got the criminal joker facing off against Batman.

295
00:13:08.920 --> 00:13:10.930
He goes to cut the wire so that, uh,

296
00:13:11.280 --> 00:13:13.870
judge Hill will fall inside the burning chemical bath, right?

297
00:13:13.870 --> 00:13:16.960
Like the water has to be on fire in order for it to fully effect, right.

298
00:13:17.000 --> 00:13:19.270
In order for it to fully take effect, but he cuts him loose.

299
00:13:19.300 --> 00:13:21.130
And then Batman saves Joe chill.

300
00:13:21.190 --> 00:13:25.090
And that's the crazy thing is the criminal was not relying on Batman saving

301
00:13:25.350 --> 00:13:25.630
judge Hill,

302
00:13:25.630 --> 00:13:29.410
that he was kind of relying on Batman's hatred of Joe chil to just let him die

303
00:13:29.470 --> 00:13:29.891
right now.

304
00:13:29.891 --> 00:13:34.030
I wouldn't necessarily say that Batman saves Joe chill because he's on a lot of

305
00:13:34.031 --> 00:13:35.380
them killed not to let anybody not. You know,

306
00:13:35.381 --> 00:13:38.650
I think it's really more of Batman saves Joe chill because he doesn't want to

307
00:13:38.651 --> 00:13:42.400
deal with another joker. I think that's really what kind of goes on here.

308
00:13:42.430 --> 00:13:45.190
But of course he ends up swinging back into action going after the criminal

309
00:13:45.191 --> 00:13:47.710
again. And then once what's the criminal's temporarily knocked out,

310
00:13:47.740 --> 00:13:50.410
Joe chill kind of looks at Batman is like, I know who you are.

311
00:13:50.470 --> 00:13:53.830
They talk about you and black gate. And you know what I did in this place,

312
00:13:53.890 --> 00:13:57.730
are you going to kill me? And it's a little bit ambiguous here, right?

313
00:13:57.731 --> 00:13:59.080
It's a little bit ambiguous here.

314
00:13:59.110 --> 00:14:03.610
It's one of these things where Joe chill almost kind of wants Batman to kill

315
00:14:03.700 --> 00:14:06.070
him. I mean, well, I guess it's not really ambiguous. He says I deserve it,

316
00:14:06.071 --> 00:14:07.870
but it's almost kind of like he wants Batman to kill him.

317
00:14:07.930 --> 00:14:11.920
But the cool thing about this is Joe chill is exceedingly remorseful for his

318
00:14:11.921 --> 00:14:12.754
actions.

319
00:14:12.790 --> 00:14:16.330
And that's an important thing because Batman's initial response is like, no,

320
00:14:16.331 --> 00:14:18.820
I'm not going to kill you. And that's when Joe's feels like I deserve it.

321
00:14:18.850 --> 00:14:22.600
I'm truly sorry for what I did this combined with with Batman's knowledge of the

322
00:14:22.601 --> 00:14:26.830
fact that judge Hill had written these letters before he became sick indicates

323
00:14:26.890 --> 00:14:30.040
that he really is remorseful. He's not remorseful because he's on his last days.

324
00:14:30.100 --> 00:14:33.190
He really does feel terrible about what he did because Joe chill,

325
00:14:33.191 --> 00:14:36.940
one turned the life of Bruce Wayne upside down and two doomed Gotham.

326
00:14:37.060 --> 00:14:40.540
He made Gotham what it is by getting rid of Thomas and Martha Wayne and allowing

327
00:14:40.541 --> 00:14:44.290
corruption among the police and among politicians and among the ultra wealthy to

328
00:14:44.291 --> 00:14:46.630
run Supreme. He made Gotham the way that it is.

329
00:14:46.660 --> 00:14:48.280
He single handedly screwed up the whole town.

330
00:14:48.310 --> 00:14:51.080
And so it's kind of crazy because of course the bricks start to fall and then

331
00:14:51.081 --> 00:14:53.300
Batman rescues him again. And you know, he says, thank you about,

332
00:14:53.301 --> 00:14:54.860
and I was like, you're welcome. But in that moment,

333
00:14:54.890 --> 00:14:57.110
the criminal pops back up again. Right? And he says like,

334
00:14:57.140 --> 00:15:00.680
I'd hope to extend this game more. But now we all go together right.

335
00:15:00.681 --> 00:15:03.890
And gets ready to pull this, the stick of dynamite, any shot by the comedian.

336
00:15:04.180 --> 00:15:07.070
But the comedian shoots him in the head and says, and then there was one,

337
00:15:07.100 --> 00:15:09.500
take me away. Bats arrest me and take me away.

338
00:15:09.800 --> 00:15:12.280
Now the big question here is why even kill him?

339
00:15:12.490 --> 00:15:15.550
Why even kill them in the first place? Why kill the criminal? Well,

340
00:15:15.551 --> 00:15:17.770
the reason for this comes after Barbara Gordon,

341
00:15:17.771 --> 00:15:21.220
Jason Todd Shira moment where Jason Todd's kind of pits about Batman,

342
00:15:21.221 --> 00:15:22.630
just kind of sitting in back to the bad cave,

343
00:15:22.660 --> 00:15:25.420
but he also asked Barbara Gordon really a chance about us, right?

344
00:15:25.421 --> 00:15:28.420
Because remember like this year to kiss and Barbara was like, no, you know,

345
00:15:28.421 --> 00:15:31.150
he gets friends zone basically as a year, you'd make a really good friend.

346
00:15:31.151 --> 00:15:33.460
You know, I don't know what to tell you. I don't feel that way about you. Right.

347
00:15:33.461 --> 00:15:35.500
He just basically gets shut down. And so of course, you know,

348
00:15:35.501 --> 00:15:37.480
the two of them ended up going their separate ways temporarily,

349
00:15:37.510 --> 00:15:40.960
but Batman starts having a conversation with the joker and the joker says like,

350
00:15:41.100 --> 00:15:44.740
he's, he's literally see now, after all of that drama, don't you feel better,

351
00:15:44.741 --> 00:15:48.010
Bruce. Right? Bruce Wayne, Barbara Gordon, Jason, Todd. You know, I know,

352
00:15:48.011 --> 00:15:50.680
but I don't care. I'm not going to tell anybody, right.

353
00:15:50.681 --> 00:15:54.430
The world can never know your true name. You might stop doing this. If I do,

354
00:15:54.700 --> 00:15:57.700
right. If I tell people who you really are, right, you might quit.

355
00:15:57.760 --> 00:16:01.120
And that really kind of solidifies a lot of what was established in Scott.

356
00:16:01.121 --> 00:16:05.260
Snyder's new 52 Batman run that the joker doesn't care about Bruce Wayne's

357
00:16:05.261 --> 00:16:06.400
identity as Batman.

358
00:16:06.580 --> 00:16:09.790
But what he cares about is the cat and mouse game that they chase each other

359
00:16:09.820 --> 00:16:13.000
around. They just go round and round and round in circles.

360
00:16:13.030 --> 00:16:15.730
The funny thing about this is when Batman asked the question,

361
00:16:15.760 --> 00:16:18.580
what is it that you want? Right? The joker says, what do I want?

362
00:16:18.581 --> 00:16:20.650
Certainly not what the others did. The clown,

363
00:16:20.860 --> 00:16:22.600
your troubled Robin put a bullet in.

364
00:16:22.630 --> 00:16:26.740
All he wanted to do was laugh at the suffering of others. How common right?

365
00:16:26.950 --> 00:16:29.920
And the criminal old man was so delusional.

366
00:16:29.950 --> 00:16:34.090
This whole great big idea of creating a better joker. Well, that's just lunacy,

367
00:16:34.210 --> 00:16:37.180
right? A defined joker one with a name and identity.

368
00:16:37.210 --> 00:16:41.680
That ruins the very definition of me. That's why I regret making him.

369
00:16:41.830 --> 00:16:45.430
Or he says, does it do, does he regret making me the reality of this?

370
00:16:45.431 --> 00:16:48.100
If I'm really a betting man here, this is the original joker.

371
00:16:48.160 --> 00:16:51.520
The comedian is the original joker. And his comes in a couple different ways.

372
00:16:51.580 --> 00:16:54.430
Like what Batman says, what's the punchline. The joker says, that's the point.

373
00:16:54.460 --> 00:16:55.930
There's no final twist, right?

374
00:16:55.931 --> 00:16:57.700
Not until I decide to put my knife into your heart.

375
00:16:57.790 --> 00:17:01.420
But he says a criminal was absolutely wrong. I am chaos, right? I'm the devil.

376
00:17:01.450 --> 00:17:05.140
I'm nothing in everything to you. The joker is not the one who's broken.

377
00:17:05.200 --> 00:17:08.770
It's Batman, who's broken. All of this was basically my plant.

378
00:17:09.160 --> 00:17:13.300
Batman was broken by a greater pain than any of us could ever inflict on you.

379
00:17:13.301 --> 00:17:15.490
And so I convinced them that making Joe chill,

380
00:17:15.491 --> 00:17:19.450
the new joker would be the best idea. Like the man who destroyed Gotham,

381
00:17:19.451 --> 00:17:20.500
the man who destroyed you,

382
00:17:20.530 --> 00:17:24.250
making him into the joker into like another joker would push you,

383
00:17:24.520 --> 00:17:28.360
but it would destroy you on some level, in a way that I never really could.

384
00:17:28.560 --> 00:17:30.670
And the irony behind all this is, he says like,

385
00:17:30.671 --> 00:17:32.650
you save the man who kills your parents,

386
00:17:32.680 --> 00:17:35.770
who said the city literally spiraling down into your, into despair.

387
00:17:35.800 --> 00:17:39.430
This man apologized to you, which is exactly what you needed to hear. And so,

388
00:17:39.431 --> 00:17:41.890
because of me, your greatest wound has been healed.

389
00:17:41.950 --> 00:17:46.550
And so now I can be your greatest pain. I will cut. You. I'll hurt you all.

390
00:17:46.551 --> 00:17:51.510
I'll destroy your life in every way that I possibly can because

391
00:17:51.511 --> 00:17:55.530
now I am your only real focus you're dealt with Joe chill. You dealt with that,

392
00:17:55.590 --> 00:17:58.830
that pain and that struggle and that anger that you've been carrying around all

393
00:17:58.831 --> 00:18:03.390
your life, that wound is now healed. Now there's the wounds that I can create.

394
00:18:03.420 --> 00:18:05.040
I can become your source.

395
00:18:05.070 --> 00:18:07.410
I can become your source of anger and your source of pain.

396
00:18:07.500 --> 00:18:09.990
I can become the thing that you hate the most in this world.

397
00:18:10.080 --> 00:18:13.170
I am now your main focus. That was the whole plan behind this, right?

398
00:18:13.171 --> 00:18:15.390
That was the whole basis behind this. It's an amazing reveal.

399
00:18:15.400 --> 00:18:18.990
But Bruce Wayne of course goes to visit Joe Hill and basically accepts Joe

400
00:18:19.260 --> 00:18:21.810
chills apology. Right? The two of them actually ended up holding hands,

401
00:18:21.811 --> 00:18:23.760
which is a massive moment.

402
00:18:23.790 --> 00:18:26.400
And he actually holds the hand of judge Hill as he dies.

403
00:18:26.580 --> 00:18:29.820
And so while Batman didn't necessarily tell Joe Hill in that alleyway,

404
00:18:29.880 --> 00:18:30.690
I forgive you.

405
00:18:30.690 --> 00:18:34.920
This is Bruce Wayne appearing to Joe chill as Joe chil needed for Bruce Wayne to

406
00:18:34.921 --> 00:18:37.440
appear to him and say, I forgive you for what you've done.

407
00:18:37.530 --> 00:18:40.020
Forgiveness is what Bruce Wayne needed to heal himself.

408
00:18:40.050 --> 00:18:42.930
And it's what Joe chil needed to finally be able to come to terms of what it was

409
00:18:42.931 --> 00:18:44.730
that he did. George Hill of course dies.

410
00:18:44.731 --> 00:18:48.270
And he ends up being buried and then Batman or Bruce Wayne ends up traveling to

411
00:18:48.271 --> 00:18:49.710
Alaska. And he basically says,

412
00:18:49.711 --> 00:18:51.090
you kind of have this a little bit of a statement.

413
00:18:51.120 --> 00:18:52.920
The world can never know your true name.

414
00:18:52.950 --> 00:18:56.040
You end up having this bit of a conversation that Batman has with Alfred. Now,

415
00:18:56.041 --> 00:18:57.230
there is also a letter that, that,

416
00:18:57.240 --> 00:18:59.520
that red hood leaves her Barbara Gordon and says it like,

417
00:18:59.521 --> 00:19:00.510
I want to make a change, right?

418
00:19:00.511 --> 00:19:03.360
But I came to that without you basically like it's a confession of love is a

419
00:19:03.361 --> 00:19:05.220
confession of love that he needs Barbara Gordon.

420
00:19:05.250 --> 00:19:08.670
The problem is like the letter falls off a wall and ends up being swept away by

421
00:19:08.671 --> 00:19:11.540
just some random guy. So she never got the letter. And Jason Todd says,

422
00:19:11.541 --> 00:19:13.820
I'll never bring it up. If you never say anything to me,

423
00:19:13.850 --> 00:19:16.190
then I'll assume you toilet letter up and threw it away.

424
00:19:16.220 --> 00:19:18.980
And I'll never ask you about it. If you never come to me and talk about it,

425
00:19:19.040 --> 00:19:19.880
I'll never come to you.

426
00:19:19.910 --> 00:19:22.160
And I'll assume that if you never came to me and talked to me about it,

427
00:19:22.280 --> 00:19:23.990
that you didn't want to be a part of my life in that way,

428
00:19:24.020 --> 00:19:25.610
that you didn't want to love me in that way,

429
00:19:25.611 --> 00:19:28.820
that you didn't want us to become something it's actually tragic. Right?

430
00:19:28.821 --> 00:19:31.700
It's insanely tragic, right? Because if I'm being honest,

431
00:19:31.730 --> 00:19:34.400
as weird as it is that Robert Gordon and Jason Todd kiss,

432
00:19:34.401 --> 00:19:36.470
because they're kind of like adopted brother and sister,

433
00:19:36.500 --> 00:19:38.900
I guess I could kind of ship them, you know, see them going together.

434
00:19:38.930 --> 00:19:41.540
I don't really know, but Batman ends up having a conversation with Alfred.

435
00:19:41.660 --> 00:19:45.230
And the crazy thing about this is you basically have Bruce Wayne talking to

436
00:19:45.231 --> 00:19:47.960
Alfred insane. I don't mean to sound the way that people think I do,

437
00:19:47.961 --> 00:19:52.220
but like I'm Batman, right? I knew the Joker's name one week after we first met,

438
00:19:52.250 --> 00:19:55.490
I've known his identity the entire time. And then you get these little moments,

439
00:19:55.491 --> 00:19:57.740
these little scenes that come from a killing joke.

440
00:19:57.770 --> 00:20:00.740
And basically like you end up having the wife of the joker we're in the killing

441
00:20:00.741 --> 00:20:03.410
joke. The joke, the explanation to the Joker's wife was that he died.

442
00:20:03.440 --> 00:20:07.160
The reality of this is that it looks as though that's not true that she was

443
00:20:07.161 --> 00:20:09.740
actually sent away because it looked like she would never, ever,

444
00:20:09.741 --> 00:20:11.000
ever be free of the joker.

445
00:20:11.030 --> 00:20:14.540
How the nature of these two guys consolidates with the way they were depicted.

446
00:20:14.541 --> 00:20:17.510
Right? Because they refer to the jokers, like sir, different things like that.

447
00:20:17.510 --> 00:20:19.640
Doesn't quite make a whole lot of sense, you know, but, but anyway,

448
00:20:19.670 --> 00:20:21.920
she's basically talking to cops and he wind up having, you know,

449
00:20:21.921 --> 00:20:23.450
having her basically escorted away.

450
00:20:23.540 --> 00:20:25.340
Essentially it looked like her death was faked, right.

451
00:20:25.341 --> 00:20:27.050
But she ends up getting away from, from, you know,

452
00:20:27.051 --> 00:20:28.490
the joker before he became the joker.

453
00:20:28.550 --> 00:20:32.360
And she ends up traveling to Alaska where she's been this entire time with her

454
00:20:32.361 --> 00:20:35.960
kid that she's raising. And so what this points to, and what,

455
00:20:35.961 --> 00:20:40.100
and what I'm going with, this is the real joker out of all, three of these guys,

456
00:20:40.101 --> 00:20:44.000
the real joker is the killing joke, joker, the criminal joker and the, the,

457
00:20:44.001 --> 00:20:47.290
the clown joker. They were created by the comedian, right?

458
00:20:47.320 --> 00:20:50.020
They were created by him and that they're not actually jokers.

459
00:20:50.021 --> 00:20:52.570
They were just two random guys out there who, for whatever reason,

460
00:20:52.600 --> 00:20:56.530
the comedian joker chose. So the comedian is the true joker, right?

461
00:20:56.531 --> 00:21:00.190
The origin of the killing joke is the actual origin of the joker. Right.

462
00:21:00.191 --> 00:21:02.410
And it makes sense. That's the one that fans go with the most,

463
00:21:02.440 --> 00:21:04.810
but that's where things stand right now, killing Joe joker.

464
00:21:04.930 --> 00:21:08.590
That story is the original origin of the joker. He is the original joker, right?

465
00:21:08.591 --> 00:21:10.660
So with that being said, guys, we're gonna bring this video to an end.

466
00:21:10.720 --> 00:21:11.860
If you are new here to comments,

467
00:21:11.861 --> 00:21:14.110
