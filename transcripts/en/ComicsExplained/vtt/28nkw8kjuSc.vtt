00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:01.410
<v 0>What's going on, guys. This is Rob,</v>

2
00:00:01.411 --> 00:00:04.320
and I guess I should have seen this coming when I threw this on the pole.

3
00:00:04.350 --> 00:00:07.860
But this week you guys voted to see a battle between Peter pork,

4
00:00:08.210 --> 00:00:10.940
the spectacular spider ham, and Roger, Rodney rabbit,

5
00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:14.390
better known as captain carrot, captain carrot. I love captain care,

6
00:00:14.510 --> 00:00:15.710
captain carrot, super bunny,

7
00:00:15.740 --> 00:00:19.280
but before we discuss which of these anthropomorphic adversaries will come out

8
00:00:19.281 --> 00:00:19.730
on top,

9
00:00:19.730 --> 00:00:24.410
let's discuss each character's origin and powers starting with spider ham.

10
00:00:24.440 --> 00:00:28.220
So spider ham was created by Larry Hama, Tom DeFalco, and Mark Armstrong,

11
00:00:28.280 --> 00:00:30.710
and first appear to Marvel tales, starring pier Parker,

12
00:00:30.740 --> 00:00:33.650
the spectacular spider ham in 1983. Now,

13
00:00:33.651 --> 00:00:37.370
after that initial one-shot spider ham starred in his own ongoing series

14
00:00:37.400 --> 00:00:40.660
published under Marvel star comics imprint, which was an imprint.

15
00:00:40.661 --> 00:00:44.120
They typically used to publish comics based on licenses that they'd acquired

16
00:00:44.121 --> 00:00:46.430
like alpha Chuck Norris, karate commandos,

17
00:00:46.431 --> 00:00:48.560
which I really need to cover on this channel.

18
00:00:48.590 --> 00:00:52.160
But spider Ham's title was one of a handful of titles featuring original

19
00:00:52.161 --> 00:00:55.160
characters that actually kicked off the star comics line.

20
00:00:55.430 --> 00:00:59.300
No spider ham whose real name is Peter Benjamin porker lives in a reality

21
00:00:59.301 --> 00:01:03.020
designated as earth, 83 11 and Marvel's universe numbering system,

22
00:01:03.080 --> 00:01:06.770
which is inhabited by various anthropomorphic animals that are basically

23
00:01:06.771 --> 00:01:11.150
parodies of popular Marvel heroes and villains such as captain America and Dr.

24
00:01:11.151 --> 00:01:15.170
Doom, which interestingly Peter Parker was originally not a pig,

25
00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:18.980
but was simply a spider named Peter that lived in the basement of a crazy

26
00:01:18.981 --> 00:01:22.850
scientist named Mae porker, who was, as her name implies a pig.

27
00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:26.060
Now may invent an atomic powered hairdryer. And when she tests it out,

28
00:01:26.090 --> 00:01:28.670
she becomes radioactive. And in the ensuing confusion,

29
00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:31.130
she bites Peter turning him into a pig,

30
00:01:31.220 --> 00:01:33.260
but retaining all of his spider abilities,

31
00:01:33.290 --> 00:01:36.770
realizing that he had become something greater than either spider or pig,

32
00:01:36.830 --> 00:01:38.570
he christened himself spider ham.

33
00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:42.380
Now he would continue living with Mae porker who due to her being radiated by

34
00:01:42.381 --> 00:01:43.070
the blow dryer,

35
00:01:43.070 --> 00:01:46.550
believed herself to be Peter's on and who will go on to use his new found

36
00:01:46.551 --> 00:01:48.770
abilities to fight crime as spider ham,

37
00:01:48.800 --> 00:01:51.290
while also working as a photographer for the daily beagle,

38
00:01:51.440 --> 00:01:54.350
a newspaper ran by Jay Jonah Jackal. Now spider ham,

39
00:01:54.380 --> 00:01:57.530
who would actually be brought into the main Marvel continuity with the spider

40
00:01:57.531 --> 00:01:58.760
verse in 2014,

41
00:01:58.790 --> 00:02:02.030
which saw various versions of Spider-Man from across the multi-verse teaming up

42
00:02:02.031 --> 00:02:03.800
to fight a group of villains known as the inheritors,

43
00:02:03.801 --> 00:02:07.700
and would also show up during the secret Wars event in 2015 and most recently

44
00:02:07.760 --> 00:02:09.800
reuniting with five other versions, man,

45
00:02:09.830 --> 00:02:12.260
to form a team known as the web warriors. And of course,

46
00:02:12.290 --> 00:02:16.160
spider ham Rose to even more prominence after his inclusion and the film into

47
00:02:16.161 --> 00:02:18.860
the spider verse, which is the best Spider-Man film to date.

48
00:02:18.920 --> 00:02:22.280
I don't care what anyone says. Now. Agile has powers.

49
00:02:22.340 --> 00:02:24.800
Spider hams are pretty much the same as Spider-Man.

50
00:02:24.830 --> 00:02:28.430
He has super human strength having been shown to lift up to 10 tons and he can

51
00:02:28.431 --> 00:02:32.480
adhere to walls as well as a pre-cognitive spider sense that warns him of any

52
00:02:32.481 --> 00:02:34.880
impending danger. Now, spider ham has also stayed.

53
00:02:35.150 --> 00:02:39.110
It is able to track others by scent and can move his arms fast enough to create

54
00:02:39.111 --> 00:02:42.470
tornadoes. In addition to his superpowers, when he was bitten by Mae Porter,

55
00:02:42.620 --> 00:02:46.580
he was granted her scientific knowledge, which is used in a variety of ways,

56
00:02:46.610 --> 00:02:49.430
but most notably to construct a pair of web shooters,

57
00:02:49.460 --> 00:02:53.180
which produce web strong enough to swing or restrain his enemies. Now,

58
00:02:53.181 --> 00:02:57.170
spider ham has displayed a level of durability that could only be described as

59
00:02:57.171 --> 00:03:00.040
cartoonish because, well, he's basically cartoon character.

60
00:03:00.070 --> 00:03:03.700
He survived being stepped on by a robot weighing 200,000 pounds,

61
00:03:03.730 --> 00:03:06.820
but it does do significant damage to him. But on another occasion,

62
00:03:06.850 --> 00:03:08.290
he was struck by an alternative universe,

63
00:03:08.291 --> 00:03:10.600
Thor reeling a hammer and was only minimally harmed.

64
00:03:10.660 --> 00:03:14.470
So it was hard to get a real sense of how durable he is because he's just been

65
00:03:14.471 --> 00:03:18.310
written so inconsistently and seemingly depends on whatever the pot dictates.

66
00:03:18.340 --> 00:03:22.320
Now going up against spider ham, we have captured and Karen captain carrot.

67
00:03:22.350 --> 00:03:24.870
I love captain carrot, Kevin [inaudible] bunny.

68
00:03:25.140 --> 00:03:27.090
Who's created by Roy Thomas and Scott Shaw.

69
00:03:27.150 --> 00:03:30.840
And first appeared a new team Titans. Number 16 in 1982,

70
00:03:30.990 --> 00:03:32.190
the following the first appearance,

71
00:03:32.220 --> 00:03:36.060
he would appear in an ongoing series from 1982 to 1983,

72
00:03:36.061 --> 00:03:39.780
titled captain carrot and his amazing zoo crew. Now much like spider ham,

73
00:03:39.810 --> 00:03:43.410
captain carrot comes from a world filled with talking anthropomorphic animals

74
00:03:43.440 --> 00:03:47.610
with his home world being designated earth seat within DCS multi-verse prior to

75
00:03:47.611 --> 00:03:48.930
crisis on infinite earths.

76
00:03:48.960 --> 00:03:52.800
But this designation has since been updated to earth 26 and the current

77
00:03:52.801 --> 00:03:56.100
multi-verse captain carrot's real name was originally Roger rabbit,

78
00:03:56.130 --> 00:03:59.400
but it was later changed to Roger Rodney rabbit due to potential confusion with

79
00:03:59.460 --> 00:04:02.220
the film who framed Roger rabbit release in 1988,

80
00:04:02.250 --> 00:04:05.640
Roger rabbit's transformation into captain carrot can be traced back to a day

81
00:04:05.790 --> 00:04:09.720
and metropolis on earth. One when all the citizens began acting like monkeys,

82
00:04:09.750 --> 00:04:13.140
which prompted Superman to go into space and to investigate. Now,

83
00:04:13.141 --> 00:04:15.480
we notice the strange energy emanating from Pluto,

84
00:04:15.510 --> 00:04:19.230
which he believes to be a planet because this was in the eighties and everyone

85
00:04:19.231 --> 00:04:22.590
was an idiot back then and thought Pluto was an actual planet.

86
00:04:22.620 --> 00:04:24.000
But as he flies towards Pluto,

87
00:04:24.030 --> 00:04:26.730
he runs into an energy barrier surrounding the earth. Now,

88
00:04:26.850 --> 00:04:28.590
when he sees a meteor go through the barrier,

89
00:04:28.620 --> 00:04:32.010
he gets the bright idea to use a meteor, to go through the barrier himself,

90
00:04:32.040 --> 00:04:34.500
which results in Superman being taken to earth, sea,

91
00:04:34.560 --> 00:04:37.890
and the meteor shattering into several radioactive fragments. Now,

92
00:04:37.891 --> 00:04:39.570
one of these fragments ends up a radiating,

93
00:04:39.580 --> 00:04:42.780
a carrot being eaten by comic book artist named Roger rabbit.

94
00:04:42.810 --> 00:04:46.410
But upon eating the carrot Roger's physique instantly becomes more muscular and

95
00:04:46.411 --> 00:04:49.740
he develops powers such as acute hearing and the ability to leap grade

96
00:04:49.741 --> 00:04:50.370
distances.

97
00:04:50.370 --> 00:04:54.120
Now Roger decides to become a costumed hero named captain carrot and finds that

98
00:04:54.121 --> 00:04:57.450
several other residents of the city have also been granted powers from being

99
00:04:57.451 --> 00:05:00.480
exposed to the meatier fragments. And with these new allies,

100
00:05:00.540 --> 00:05:03.420
he would form the superhero team known as the zoo crew.

101
00:05:03.450 --> 00:05:07.320
Now captain carrot has taken part in a few stories in the main DC continuity,

102
00:05:07.350 --> 00:05:12.210
usually within the context of crisis events that reset DCS continuity earth sea

103
00:05:12.240 --> 00:05:15.810
was able to survive the crisis on a vendor's due to its destination as an

104
00:05:15.811 --> 00:05:19.290
alternate dimension instead of a parallel earth and captain carrot and a zoo

105
00:05:19.291 --> 00:05:22.890
crew would play a role in final crisis as they were part of the team of heroes

106
00:05:22.920 --> 00:05:24.810
that took on Mandrax. The dark monitor.

107
00:05:24.990 --> 00:05:28.320
Now captain carrot is briefly appeared in the new 52 continuity and the

108
00:05:28.321 --> 00:05:31.860
Multiversity storyline by grant Morrison and during the multiplicity storyline

109
00:05:31.861 --> 00:05:34.770
and the Superman title during DC rebirth back when it was good.

110
00:05:34.800 --> 00:05:37.650
But most recently it was revealed in dark nights, death metal,

111
00:05:37.651 --> 00:05:41.460
multi versus in that earth, 26 was destroyed by the villain Perpetua.

112
00:05:41.490 --> 00:05:44.790
And so captain coats powers are pretty similar to those of Superman.

113
00:05:44.820 --> 00:05:45.600
And for that reason,

114
00:05:45.600 --> 00:05:49.320
he's generally considered the Superman of earth 26 for events that bring the

115
00:05:49.800 --> 00:05:51.840
respective Superman from various universes together.

116
00:05:51.870 --> 00:05:54.600
Now we have superhuman strength, endurance, and durability,

117
00:05:54.660 --> 00:05:57.890
as well as superhuman hearing and sight. And now instead of being able to fly,

118
00:05:57.891 --> 00:06:01.010
however, captain carrot has the ability to jump really far.

119
00:06:01.040 --> 00:06:04.730
The one caveat to captain carrots powers is that his power supply must be

120
00:06:04.731 --> 00:06:08.960
replenished periodically by consuming cosmic carrots Bruin in the soil that was

121
00:06:08.961 --> 00:06:11.060
struck by the radioactive meteorite fragment. Now,

122
00:06:11.090 --> 00:06:14.060
if counting carrot goes 24 hours without eating another carrot,

123
00:06:14.090 --> 00:06:15.920
he reverts back to his normal power level,

124
00:06:15.980 --> 00:06:19.730
which is that of a near-sighted human rabbit hybrid that draws comic books.

125
00:06:19.760 --> 00:06:20.510
Luckily for him,

126
00:06:20.510 --> 00:06:24.470
he's managed to produce a near constant supply of cosmic carrots by dedicating

127
00:06:24.471 --> 00:06:27.890
part of the zoo crew headquarters to growing them. And so with all that in mind,

128
00:06:27.920 --> 00:06:30.170
it's time for us to declare a winner.

129
00:06:30.230 --> 00:06:33.710
And this is probably the most ridiculous battle that I think we've ever done

130
00:06:33.711 --> 00:06:36.440
more so than. I think we're going to put this on YouTube proper

131
00:06:37.970 --> 00:06:41.840
because both these characters exist in universes where the laws of physics are

132
00:06:41.841 --> 00:06:43.640
not applicable and the multi versus,

133
00:06:43.641 --> 00:06:47.000
and the book captain carrot even points out that the laws of physics are

134
00:06:47.001 --> 00:06:49.310
different on earth, 26 than other earth.

135
00:06:49.370 --> 00:06:52.760
And so we thought Perpetua would not be able to cause as much destruction there.

136
00:06:52.820 --> 00:06:55.970
And the reason this makes things difficult is that it's just hard to get a sense

137
00:06:55.971 --> 00:06:59.180
of how powerful these characters are. Because more often than not,

138
00:06:59.210 --> 00:07:01.670
they're doing things that are absolutely absurd,

139
00:07:01.790 --> 00:07:04.910
but you guys knew that when you picked it and it's actually probably why you

140
00:07:04.911 --> 00:07:05.330
picked it.

141
00:07:05.330 --> 00:07:09.950
So let's just move on to figuring out who would win between captain carrot and

142
00:07:09.951 --> 00:07:14.930
spider ham. I love captain carrot guys. I'm sorry. I love captain carrot.

143
00:07:14.931 --> 00:07:17.120
He's amazing. He's so awesome.

144
00:07:18.710 --> 00:07:21.200
I feel like we should cover captain carrot and his amazing zoo crew.

145
00:07:21.230 --> 00:07:25.460
I feel like we should cover those comics. They're so fun. They are so much fun.

146
00:07:25.580 --> 00:07:28.250
But leaving aside that he's an anthropomorphic pig,

147
00:07:28.280 --> 00:07:31.850
spider ham is for all intents and purposes. Just another version of Spider-Man.

148
00:07:31.880 --> 00:07:33.920
He has all the same powers of Spider-Man.

149
00:07:33.950 --> 00:07:37.400
He has a scientific knowledge of Spider-Man and he's a newspaper photographer.

150
00:07:37.460 --> 00:07:40.910
Just like Spider-Man really, the only difference is that he's a pig.

151
00:07:40.970 --> 00:07:44.420
I guess he theoretically does have pig powers in addition to a spider powers.

152
00:07:44.450 --> 00:07:46.940
And his heightened sense of smell is likely due to that,

153
00:07:46.970 --> 00:07:51.260
but I'm not sure what other powers he would get by virtue of being a pig captain

154
00:07:51.261 --> 00:07:52.220
carrot. On the other hand,

155
00:07:52.250 --> 00:07:55.220
although cartoonish in nature is still a Superman analog.

156
00:07:55.250 --> 00:07:59.390
He's the strongest hero from earth 26 and has been called upon on more than one

157
00:07:59.391 --> 00:08:03.500
occasion to fight alongside the other Superman from the multi-verse as such his

158
00:08:03.501 --> 00:08:07.100
powers are on an entirely different level than spider Ham's justice.

159
00:08:07.101 --> 00:08:09.740
Superman's powers are far beyond those of Spiderman.

160
00:08:09.770 --> 00:08:13.280
So nine times out of 10 captain carrot emerges victorious here.

161
00:08:13.340 --> 00:08:17.390
The one out of 10 shot that I would give spider ham is if he's able to prolong

162
00:08:17.391 --> 00:08:20.930
the battle longer than 24 hours and figure out a way to keep counting care from

163
00:08:21.410 --> 00:08:23.270
replenishing his powers by eating another carrot. Now,

164
00:08:23.271 --> 00:08:26.720
although this is unlikely due to the advanced carrot growing operation,

165
00:08:26.721 --> 00:08:28.010
captain carrot has set up,

166
00:08:28.040 --> 00:08:32.450
which has been investigated multiple times by the DEA. Uh, no, it hasn't.

167
00:08:32.660 --> 00:08:35.360
I don't know why I said that probably because growing carrots in order to get

168
00:08:35.361 --> 00:08:38.390
power, sounds like something, uh, uh, like a, like a meth head would do,

169
00:08:38.391 --> 00:08:40.400
but spider ham is a highly intelligent pig.

170
00:08:40.400 --> 00:08:42.080
So maybe he can figure out a way to do it,

171
00:08:42.110 --> 00:08:45.740
or maybe he can come up with some advanced technology to negate the radioactive

172
00:08:46.070 --> 00:08:49.460
effects of the soil and thereby deprive the carrots, other special abilities.

173
00:08:49.520 --> 00:08:52.300
I just want to say, I think it's hilarious to let,

174
00:08:52.301 --> 00:08:55.320
like the idea of meeting a meth head who's like cultivating or like,

175
00:08:55.380 --> 00:08:58.740
like cooking and like some room somewhere. And they're like, what are you doing?

176
00:08:58.741 --> 00:09:02.040
It's like, I'm making my cosmic Herricks man. So I can become captain carrot.

177
00:09:02.210 --> 00:09:05.940
I mean, it's, it's not good, but I feel like it's hilarious.

178
00:09:09.330 --> 00:09:13.950
Or like somebody growing in like their basement. And they're just saying like,

179
00:09:14.070 --> 00:09:17.760
they're their cosmic carrots, right? Like, I feel like that'd be hilarious.

180
00:09:17.761 --> 00:09:19.200
I don't know. It just sounds funny to me,

181
00:09:19.260 --> 00:09:22.530
but regardless barring the ability to prevent captain carrot from being able to

182
00:09:22.531 --> 00:09:24.870
consume one of his carrots within a 24 hour period,

183
00:09:24.900 --> 00:09:28.050
captain is going to win almost every single time. What would that be? He said,

184
00:09:28.051 --> 00:09:29.790
guys, we're gonna bring this video to an end.
