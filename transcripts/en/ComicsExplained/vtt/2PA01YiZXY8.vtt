4
00:00:11.040 --> 00:00:11.630
Okay.

5
00:00:11.630 --> 00:00:13.580
<v 1>So as promised in a previous video,</v>

6
00:00:13.581 --> 00:00:16.250
actually yesterday's video or the day before yesterday,

7
00:00:16.280 --> 00:00:18.770
the video that we did about dark nights, metal and the multi-verse and all that,

8
00:00:18.800 --> 00:00:21.960
I promised you guys that I would make a video about the overview,

9
00:00:22.010 --> 00:00:23.690
the over monitor, all that kind of stuff.

10
00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:26.150
Something to understand going into this though,

11
00:00:26.180 --> 00:00:29.060
is that all of this is largely speculation.

12
00:00:29.090 --> 00:00:31.400
When grant Morrison created the over void,

13
00:00:31.401 --> 00:00:34.130
he didn't really hold our hand and walk us through it and say,

14
00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:35.600
this is the nature of the thing.

15
00:00:35.630 --> 00:00:38.540
That's the reason why you see so many people out there who more or less

16
00:00:38.541 --> 00:00:40.430
speculate on what the void is.

17
00:00:40.460 --> 00:00:43.610
But I think this is going to give us a pretty solid understanding going forward

18
00:00:43.611 --> 00:00:47.090
until such a time as somebody like grant Morrison comes along and basically

19
00:00:47.091 --> 00:00:48.410
offers some explanation to,

20
00:00:48.411 --> 00:00:51.560
this is one of the biggest issues that DC struggled with over the course of

21
00:00:51.561 --> 00:00:55.700
their entire publication history is effectively organizing and consolidating

22
00:00:55.730 --> 00:00:58.820
their greater cosmology, right? It's just kind of a thing that's there.

23
00:00:58.821 --> 00:01:00.380
And sometimes somebody references it.

24
00:01:00.410 --> 00:01:04.790
So the overview void at its core represents effectively imagination.

25
00:01:04.880 --> 00:01:08.660
And that's why it's described as kind of like this infinite white sheet of

26
00:01:08.661 --> 00:01:11.390
paper, more or less, and that on this singular, you know, this,

27
00:01:11.391 --> 00:01:12.590
this giant white sheet of paper,

28
00:01:12.650 --> 00:01:16.730
there's a singular tiny spot that represents like everything in DC comics and

29
00:01:16.731 --> 00:01:19.640
the grand scheme of the imagination of what we can all achieve.

30
00:01:19.670 --> 00:01:22.580
DC comics is virtually nothing, but let's kind of take this back, right?

31
00:01:22.581 --> 00:01:25.510
Because this is easier to understand if we look at it in the, in,

32
00:01:25.511 --> 00:01:28.160
in terms of levels, right? From like a singular universe,

33
00:01:28.161 --> 00:01:31.070
running up to a multi-verse to the omniverse, to the overboard,

34
00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:34.310
taking things back way, way, way back, all the way to like action comics.

35
00:01:34.311 --> 00:01:37.610
Number one, we had the introduction of Superman following Superman.

36
00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:41.870
We had a whole huge explosion of superheroes in terms of like Hawkman and like

37
00:01:41.871 --> 00:01:44.300
the specter and Batman and so on and so forth.

38
00:01:44.330 --> 00:01:47.810
And the way this worked is that you had all these different superheroes

39
00:01:47.811 --> 00:01:51.290
operating in what eventually became known as earth one.

40
00:01:51.350 --> 00:01:53.690
And we knew that it was earth one for a couple of different reasons.

41
00:01:53.720 --> 00:01:57.350
The first reason comes in the form of Batman and Superman crossing over for the

42
00:01:57.351 --> 00:01:57.950
first time.

43
00:01:57.950 --> 00:02:01.940
And that basically solidified that all the superheroes that we saw DC publishing

44
00:02:01.941 --> 00:02:04.910
at that point in time existed on the same earth. Up until that point,

45
00:02:04.940 --> 00:02:09.050
it was like the difference between like Daredevil on Netflix and the Marvel

46
00:02:09.051 --> 00:02:12.470
cinematic universe movies, right? They may or may not exist in the same place.

47
00:02:12.500 --> 00:02:14.210
We're never really given a definitive answer,

48
00:02:14.240 --> 00:02:18.260
but when Superman and Batman crossed over, it was DC saying, Batman's a Gotham,

49
00:02:18.290 --> 00:02:21.560
Superman's a metropolis. And each one can travel to the other's location.

50
00:02:21.590 --> 00:02:25.280
They both exist in the same world. Now the, the actual indication of this,

51
00:02:25.281 --> 00:02:27.380
having a numerical designation,

52
00:02:27.381 --> 00:02:31.670
which is to say the idea of DC calling this earth one didn't come along until we

53
00:02:31.671 --> 00:02:34.400
got flash of two worlds, right? The flasher to our storyline.

54
00:02:34.430 --> 00:02:36.920
And that was basically when DC created the multi-verse.

55
00:02:36.950 --> 00:02:40.310
And this was important because superheroes sort of dropping off in popularity in

56
00:02:40.311 --> 00:02:44.450
the mid 1940s. And then in the early 1950s, Julius Schwartz asked the question,

57
00:02:44.480 --> 00:02:47.690
what would happen if we took the origin of a superhero and we tied it into

58
00:02:47.691 --> 00:02:48.500
science fiction,

59
00:02:48.500 --> 00:02:51.500
and then we gave this kind kind of science fiction based superhero.

60
00:02:51.560 --> 00:02:53.660
And that was the introduction of Barry Allen, the flash,

61
00:02:53.690 --> 00:02:57.080
a guy who was doused by chemicals, struck by lightning and became a flash.

62
00:02:57.260 --> 00:02:58.530
He took the place of,

63
00:02:58.531 --> 00:03:01.960
of Jay as the flash who had been canceled some number of years prior.

64
00:03:01.990 --> 00:03:05.980
The problem with this is that DC did not explain where Jay Garrick went.

65
00:03:06.010 --> 00:03:09.160
He was somebody just canceled one day and you never got an answer, right?

66
00:03:09.161 --> 00:03:10.750
So for those of you guys coming from Marvel comics,

67
00:03:10.810 --> 00:03:13.840
it would be like if Carol Danvers simply just disappeared one day,

68
00:03:13.900 --> 00:03:15.790
and then you got a new captain Marvel in her status,

69
00:03:15.960 --> 00:03:18.610
but you just never given an answer to work. Carol Danvers went,

70
00:03:18.650 --> 00:03:23.020
the result of this is that in order for DC to satisfy fan interest and to also

71
00:03:23.021 --> 00:03:26.650
provide some measure of continuity in terms of why things have changed and

72
00:03:26.651 --> 00:03:28.000
offering an explanation to it.

73
00:03:28.030 --> 00:03:31.540
The flash of two worlds story was introduced as a way of saying all the

74
00:03:31.541 --> 00:03:35.710
superheroes that we saw operating during the time that DC was publishing comics

75
00:03:35.740 --> 00:03:36.730
in world war II,

76
00:03:36.760 --> 00:03:40.750
they all came from a universe called earth to all the superheroes that you saw

77
00:03:40.780 --> 00:03:44.350
basically operating at that point in time in the 1950s was earth one to make

78
00:03:44.351 --> 00:03:45.184
this simpler.

79
00:03:45.460 --> 00:03:48.550
Anytime you saw comics published at the time when Jay Garrick was a superhero,

80
00:03:48.580 --> 00:03:51.040
that was all earth too. And when Barry Allen became the flash,

81
00:03:51.070 --> 00:03:53.050
everything after that was all earth, one,

82
00:03:53.080 --> 00:03:56.320
following that DC created like this great, huge multi-verse you got earth three,

83
00:03:56.321 --> 00:03:58.210
which was the crime syndicate of America,

84
00:03:58.420 --> 00:04:01.510
where basically all the traditional superheroes were actually super villains,

85
00:04:01.540 --> 00:04:02.770
different things along those lines.

86
00:04:02.800 --> 00:04:06.910
But the long and short of this is that DCS multi-verse became wildly chaotic.

87
00:04:06.970 --> 00:04:07.481
And it was very,

88
00:04:07.481 --> 00:04:11.680
very difficult to keep up with what was happening or to even get into comics at

89
00:04:11.681 --> 00:04:15.040
that point in time, if you were somebody new who had never read comics before.

90
00:04:15.070 --> 00:04:18.700
And so in order to fix all of this DC launched the crisis on infinite earths

91
00:04:18.701 --> 00:04:19.030
event,

92
00:04:19.030 --> 00:04:22.870
which basically wiped out the entirety of the multi-verse and in its place,

93
00:04:22.871 --> 00:04:26.140
what you got was simply new earth. There was no multi-verse anymore.

94
00:04:26.170 --> 00:04:29.170
There was just one singular universe. And that was basically it.

95
00:04:29.200 --> 00:04:32.500
New origins were given that basically fell in line with the idea that there was

96
00:04:32.501 --> 00:04:34.720
only ever one universe. There were a few outliers,

97
00:04:34.750 --> 00:04:37.330
a couple of characters who origins didn't really make sense.

98
00:04:37.360 --> 00:04:41.020
And that's why you got future prices, events, right? Zero hour, crisis,

99
00:04:41.110 --> 00:04:45.130
and time infinite crisis, final crisis, trying to reconcile all that stuff,

100
00:04:45.131 --> 00:04:49.030
right. To basically correct the errors that came after the events of crisis on

101
00:04:49.031 --> 00:04:52.090
offenders. But with the idea of, of there simply being a new earth,

102
00:04:52.091 --> 00:04:53.200
you've got stuff like hyper time.

103
00:04:53.260 --> 00:04:54.850
That's not really important for this discussion,

104
00:04:54.880 --> 00:04:57.970
but infinite crisis basically saw the multi-verse coming back.

105
00:04:58.060 --> 00:05:01.660
And it wasn't until the events of final crisis that the superheroes became aware

106
00:05:01.661 --> 00:05:03.520
of the fact that the multi-verse had returned,

107
00:05:03.550 --> 00:05:06.580
but ever since the events of infinite crisis, the multi-verse has been back,

108
00:05:06.640 --> 00:05:09.850
right. It's basically been there as a mainstay in DC comics. Now,

109
00:05:09.851 --> 00:05:12.730
the reason why this matters and the reason why I offered you that explanation is

110
00:05:12.731 --> 00:05:16.120
one. So you can have a better understanding of what's going on in terms of, uh,

111
00:05:16.150 --> 00:05:16.990
dark nights metal,

112
00:05:17.050 --> 00:05:20.740
and like the idea of the original crisis event versus infinite crisis versus

113
00:05:20.741 --> 00:05:23.170
final crisis. And kind of understand how all those two,

114
00:05:23.200 --> 00:05:24.370
all those things tie together.

115
00:05:24.400 --> 00:05:28.120
But the other reason why I told you this is because thinking of the overboard in

116
00:05:28.300 --> 00:05:31.450
so far as going from like a hierarchy of a universe to the omniverse,

117
00:05:31.480 --> 00:05:32.710
it basically goes like this.

118
00:05:32.770 --> 00:05:36.580
So what you have is you have a singular universe and inside the singular

119
00:05:36.581 --> 00:05:37.840
universe in DC comics,

120
00:05:37.870 --> 00:05:41.410
you have the green lantern Corps and you have Batman and you have Superman and

121
00:05:41.411 --> 00:05:42.910
wonder woman and all that kind of stuff, right?

122
00:05:42.940 --> 00:05:47.110
We can use earth zero or earth prime as it's called NDC comics,

123
00:05:47.111 --> 00:05:51.280
which is what the numerical designation for the main DC universe is.

124
00:05:51.310 --> 00:05:54.820
After the events of new 52, we can call that a singular universe right now,

125
00:05:54.850 --> 00:05:59.210
beyond that you have basically an infinite number of universes DC only

126
00:05:59.211 --> 00:06:03.530
focuses on 52 because for whatever reason, DC loves that number, right.

127
00:06:03.531 --> 00:06:06.710
We don't really know why they just do. They love the number 52, right?

128
00:06:06.711 --> 00:06:09.650
So whenever you hear about DC, whenever you're reading a comic and it says,

129
00:06:09.740 --> 00:06:09.741
well,

130
00:06:09.741 --> 00:06:13.550
there's only 52 universes that we know of is because only 52 have been explored

131
00:06:13.551 --> 00:06:16.300
up to that point. Here's an actual infinite number of universes out there.

132
00:06:16.330 --> 00:06:18.880
We just haven't really seen any others besides them, those 52.

133
00:06:18.910 --> 00:06:21.670
But the idea here is that beyond this singular universe,

134
00:06:21.700 --> 00:06:23.110
we have a multi-verse right,

135
00:06:23.140 --> 00:06:26.980
a giant combination of universes that exist out there. And for the most part,

136
00:06:26.981 --> 00:06:27.880
the multi-verse is larger.

137
00:06:27.970 --> 00:06:30.580
Is it considered to be infinite because there are an infinite number of

138
00:06:30.850 --> 00:06:33.010
universe. But beyond that, multi-verse,

139
00:06:33.040 --> 00:06:35.170
we then have what's called the omnivorous.

140
00:06:35.230 --> 00:06:39.970
And the omnivorous is basically a collection of multi versus DC comics has this

141
00:06:39.971 --> 00:06:42.640
own multi-verse and then you might have like the Twilight zone.

142
00:06:42.730 --> 00:06:44.650
And if we looked at the TV show, Twilight zone,

143
00:06:44.740 --> 00:06:48.400
each story is largely self-contained. And you can even go as far as to say,

144
00:06:48.430 --> 00:06:51.790
each story is actually its own universe within the Twilight zone,

145
00:06:51.820 --> 00:06:54.700
you have their multi-verse. And then if you go and you look at Marvel comics,

146
00:06:54.730 --> 00:06:56.110
Marvel comics has their whole,

147
00:06:56.740 --> 00:06:59.650
multi-verse all these different multi multiverses from across every single

148
00:06:59.651 --> 00:07:01.120
method of publishing, right?

149
00:07:01.150 --> 00:07:04.420
Everything from books like Moby Dick to treasure Island,

150
00:07:04.450 --> 00:07:07.570
all the way up to like TV shows like black mirror on Netflix,

151
00:07:07.600 --> 00:07:09.940
or even things that have nothing to do with comic books,

152
00:07:09.970 --> 00:07:11.860
which is something like Alison Wonderland,

153
00:07:11.920 --> 00:07:15.190
like all of these have their own universes, right? They have their own,

154
00:07:15.250 --> 00:07:16.330
their own multiverses.

155
00:07:16.390 --> 00:07:20.860
And so the omniverse is a collection of every single universe or multiverse that

156
00:07:20.861 --> 00:07:22.630
exists out there. Because sometimes you have things like,

157
00:07:22.631 --> 00:07:24.790
like Alice in Wonderland, which doesn't have a multi-verse right.

158
00:07:24.880 --> 00:07:28.090
It's just a singular story told in a linear way from beginning to end.

159
00:07:28.150 --> 00:07:30.610
And there's no alternate realities to explore there. Right? I mean,

160
00:07:30.611 --> 00:07:32.020
I guess the possibility exists.

161
00:07:32.021 --> 00:07:34.810
Like what would have happened if Alice didn't go down the rabbit hole or what

162
00:07:34.811 --> 00:07:37.840
would have happened if Alice had got killed the red queen, you know,

163
00:07:38.050 --> 00:07:40.510
so like the queen of hearts somewhere along the line or something crazy,

164
00:07:40.511 --> 00:07:41.470
but it doesn't really matter.

165
00:07:41.500 --> 00:07:45.280
The whole point of this is that beyond this multi-verse and beyond this

166
00:07:45.340 --> 00:07:47.770
omniverse, you have the overboard,

167
00:07:47.830 --> 00:07:51.010
and that's why the overboard is described as this giant white sheet of paper.

168
00:07:51.040 --> 00:07:54.880
And the DC multi-verse is just the singular spec on it because in the grand

169
00:07:54.881 --> 00:07:57.910
scheme of imagination and all possible creation,

170
00:07:57.940 --> 00:08:01.840
the DC multi-verse is just this tiny itty bitty thing where there's a litany of

171
00:08:01.841 --> 00:08:03.310
other things that are on here, right?

172
00:08:03.310 --> 00:08:07.540
Everything that we as human beings could possibly create is part of this over

173
00:08:07.900 --> 00:08:08.411
void. And so that's,

174
00:08:08.411 --> 00:08:11.290
that's the important thing to understand is that while the overboard basically

175
00:08:11.291 --> 00:08:15.970
represents the idea of what we as human beings can make and the context that it

176
00:08:15.971 --> 00:08:19.870
was given grant Morrison only focus on the multi-verse now why it was

177
00:08:19.871 --> 00:08:23.230
represented as a singular white sheet and why it wasn't just simply a whole

178
00:08:23.231 --> 00:08:25.990
bunch of squares that have like everything that we've ever created,

179
00:08:25.991 --> 00:08:28.990
just kind of trailing on to the point where it basically goes out of a,

180
00:08:29.020 --> 00:08:31.720
it goes out of panel. I don't really know, but I have no real idea.

181
00:08:31.750 --> 00:08:35.470
Another theory that comes with the over void and the over monitor is that it

182
00:08:35.471 --> 00:08:37.720
only is contained to DC comics, right?

183
00:08:37.721 --> 00:08:42.190
It's it doesn't represent anything in relation to anything outside of DC comics.

184
00:08:42.250 --> 00:08:42.341
Now,

185
00:08:42.341 --> 00:08:45.670
the reason why it's called the overboard and the reason why it is just a giant

186
00:08:45.671 --> 00:08:48.520
white sheet of paper with a DC, multi-verse just kind of existing.

187
00:08:48.520 --> 00:08:52.900
There is because in relation to everything that's been created in DC versus

188
00:08:52.901 --> 00:08:57.060
everything that could be created in comics the most versus virtually nothing,

189
00:08:57.120 --> 00:08:59.670
right? Because the imagination of us as people is limitless.

190
00:08:59.700 --> 00:09:02.010
And so you have something like Scott Snyder's Batman run,

191
00:09:02.040 --> 00:09:05.610
which is virtually nothing compared to all the things Scott Snyder could imagine

192
00:09:05.611 --> 00:09:07.320
doing in DC comics, right?

193
00:09:07.980 --> 00:09:11.640
Jeff Johns green lantern run is nothing in comparison to all the things Jeff

194
00:09:11.640 --> 00:09:16.260
Johns could possibly do or across all of DC comics that everything outside of

195
00:09:16.261 --> 00:09:20.760
that singular multi-vessel spec on the overboard is basically everything DC

196
00:09:20.761 --> 00:09:23.730
hasn't done yet. Right. That's essentially what it is. Right? So again,

197
00:09:23.731 --> 00:09:28.260
it's kind of grant Morrison making an intangible concept tangible, right.

198
00:09:28.261 --> 00:09:29.370
That's basically what it is, right.

199
00:09:29.371 --> 00:09:33.180
That the overboard represents what DC could imagine doing over the course of

200
00:09:33.181 --> 00:09:36.570
their entire publication, history, every story that could make in the future.

201
00:09:36.630 --> 00:09:40.590
And then that little tiny spec being everything that they've done so far. Right.

202
00:09:40.591 --> 00:09:43.950
So it's kind of a crazy thing. It's a little bit wild, a little bit bonkers,

203
00:09:43.980 --> 00:09:45.660
but again, that's kind of what you run into when you're,

204
00:09:45.661 --> 00:09:47.130
when you're talking about grant Morrison, right.

205
00:09:47.131 --> 00:09:49.410
That's why you kind of have a lot of fans who were split on him. You know,

206
00:09:49.411 --> 00:09:51.630
you have like super hardcore grant Morrison fans who were like,

207
00:09:51.631 --> 00:09:54.270
you probably don't understand them, even though they're largely saying that,

208
00:09:54.300 --> 00:09:55.440
not understanding him,

209
00:09:55.470 --> 00:09:58.110
or you have people like me who look at grant Morrison and just say,

210
00:09:58.140 --> 00:10:00.180
you make things more complicated than they need to be.

211
00:10:00.240 --> 00:10:03.210
Just tell the story and let's call it a day. Right. That's kind of,

212
00:10:03.360 --> 00:10:06.630
that's kinda my thing. You know, when I read comics,

213
00:10:06.660 --> 00:10:08.730
sometimes I'd like to think sometimes I don't.

214
00:10:08.731 --> 00:10:11.880
And there are times when I really enjoy reading comics where I'm basically just

215
00:10:12.030 --> 00:10:14.580
kind of scrolling through the pages and not giving any real thought to what's

216
00:10:14.581 --> 00:10:17.190
happening, enjoying the madness unfolding. Right. Like I just,

217
00:10:17.191 --> 00:10:20.400
I kind of enjoy that sometimes. So hopefully this clear things up for you guys,

218
00:10:20.580 --> 00:10:21.180
uh, hopefully it, it,

219
00:10:21.180 --> 00:10:24.600
it basically made sense of what the over monitor or over void is.

220
00:10:24.630 --> 00:10:27.480
It's just total imagination in DC comics, right? All the white space,

221
00:10:27.481 --> 00:10:29.820
there is everything that DC has not done yet,

222
00:10:29.880 --> 00:10:32.850
and it represents the potential of what they could do. So with that being said,

223
00:10:32.851 --> 00:10:34.350
guys, we're going to bring this video to an end.

224
00:10:34.380 --> 00:10:36.900
If you are new here to come and explain and make sure you guys have the sub

00:10:36.901 --> 00:10:39.240
button to become part of the Rob core. If you guys enjoyed this video,

226
00:10:39.270 --> 00:10:41.550
