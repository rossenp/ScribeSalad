4
00:00:11.160 --> 00:00:11.993
What's going on, guys.

5
00:00:12.530 --> 00:00:16.100
<v 1>Is Rob. And in this video, we are going to explain the character of red Hawk.</v>

6
00:00:16.130 --> 00:00:18.620
Now, the reason why we're doing this is one because I miss doing character

7
00:00:18.621 --> 00:00:19.790
explanations and two,

8
00:00:19.791 --> 00:00:23.090
because I believe it's Jacob H is one of our higher tier patrons.

9
00:00:23.150 --> 00:00:25.280
And if you're a high enough tier on Patrion,

10
00:00:25.310 --> 00:00:29.270
you can actually request to have a character explanation video made or a beyond

11
00:00:29.271 --> 00:00:32.210
Omega level video made. And if you're even higher, you can actually get both.

12
00:00:32.240 --> 00:00:34.880
So Jacob requested that we do a video on red hook explained,

13
00:00:34.940 --> 00:00:37.490
and that's what we're going to do. So red Hawk, or I guess,

14
00:00:37.491 --> 00:00:40.970
general Thunderbolt Ross first appeared in Marvel comics with the incredible

15
00:00:40.971 --> 00:00:43.190
Hulk number one in may of 1962,

16
00:00:43.191 --> 00:00:46.730
of course he was created like most people back then by Stan Lee and Jack Kirby.

17
00:00:46.731 --> 00:00:49.580
But here's the funny thing, the origins of Thunderbolt Ross,

18
00:00:49.581 --> 00:00:52.700
like a lot of characters in Marvel are just kind of scattered all over the place

19
00:00:52.730 --> 00:00:55.520
specifically in the incredible hope. Number one, uh,

20
00:00:55.521 --> 00:00:58.010
tales to astonish number 61 and, uh,

21
00:00:58.040 --> 00:01:00.560
the incredible Hulk number 291.

22
00:01:00.561 --> 00:01:03.770
Now another thing that kind of goes on here is something called control and

23
00:01:03.771 --> 00:01:06.260
control was, uh, was something that showed up in conspiracy. Number one,

24
00:01:06.261 --> 00:01:09.860
which was this interesting line of comics that Marvel did back in 1998,

25
00:01:10.130 --> 00:01:13.520
that was made, that was done by a Dan Abnett. But for this particular purpose,

26
00:01:13.610 --> 00:01:17.150
we're going to focus on, on those original three issues that we had mentioned,

27
00:01:17.210 --> 00:01:18.950
right? So the idea of Thunderbolt Ross,

28
00:01:18.951 --> 00:01:21.470
in terms of his creation of the hands of Stanley and judge Herbie,

29
00:01:21.500 --> 00:01:25.340
was that much like a lot of the comics back then Stanley did recognize the idea

30
00:01:25.341 --> 00:01:28.730
that the incredible Hulk was kind of like this giant green rage monster,

31
00:01:28.760 --> 00:01:29.720
but more so than that,

32
00:01:29.721 --> 00:01:34.070
Stan Lee was all about the idea of focusing on the human element of characters

33
00:01:34.071 --> 00:01:35.930
in the sense that who are they beyond,

34
00:01:35.931 --> 00:01:39.170
like whatever fantastic powers they happen to hat. And so where,

35
00:01:39.490 --> 00:01:41.420
where Bruce banner was kind of this, you know,

36
00:01:41.421 --> 00:01:43.940
Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde character,

37
00:01:43.970 --> 00:01:46.790
Stan Lee thought it was really interesting to create a villain that was

38
00:01:46.791 --> 00:01:49.400
basically just a man. There was nothing really special about him.

39
00:01:49.401 --> 00:01:51.800
He didn't have any kind of super powers or anything like that.

40
00:01:51.830 --> 00:01:55.850
It was just kind of like mankind against like it's, it's almost warring nature,

41
00:01:55.880 --> 00:01:58.010
right? It's kind of what, what the incredible hope represented.

42
00:01:58.040 --> 00:02:01.130
And so when Thunderball Ross was initially introduced to us, uh,

43
00:02:01.310 --> 00:02:03.800
and the incredible hope number 291, we're given this story,

44
00:02:03.801 --> 00:02:07.460
the Thunderbolt Ross actually comes from a family of people who were involved in

45
00:02:07.461 --> 00:02:09.940
the military. And it was very much a source of pride for,

46
00:02:09.941 --> 00:02:13.580
for Thunderbolt Ross to basically join up with what was the army air Corps at

47
00:02:13.581 --> 00:02:16.220
the time in the 1940s, eventually that became the air force,

48
00:02:16.221 --> 00:02:17.630
but the army air Corps at the time,

49
00:02:17.690 --> 00:02:21.050
and then basically like Rose through the ranks exceedingly fast. Now,

50
00:02:21.140 --> 00:02:24.140
one of the things that Stan Lee didn't really give us a lot of is whether or not

51
00:02:24.141 --> 00:02:27.650
it was based largely on his abilities or on his family history, right?

52
00:02:27.651 --> 00:02:29.870
Because I have to believe like most things in the world,

53
00:02:29.900 --> 00:02:32.690
the military kind of allows you to move up in the ranks based on your own family

54
00:02:32.691 --> 00:02:36.290
history, right? So the stronger your family ties with the military, uh,

55
00:02:36.320 --> 00:02:39.260
and the more involved they were, the easier I think it is for you to move up.

56
00:02:39.290 --> 00:02:42.410
I don't really have any evidence to support that. I'm not a military man myself,

57
00:02:42.440 --> 00:02:45.290
but it's something that I always kind of believed to be true just based on my

58
00:02:45.291 --> 00:02:46.700
own, my own work experience.

59
00:02:46.730 --> 00:02:50.270
But regardless during world war two general Thunderbolt Ross actually moved up

60
00:02:50.271 --> 00:02:52.820
to the role of the captain and fought in the Pacific theater.

61
00:02:52.850 --> 00:02:56.660
But one of the big things that came out of Thunderbolt Ross came with regards to

62
00:02:56.661 --> 00:03:01.450
a concept called control and control was given to us as this post-World war II

63
00:03:01.480 --> 00:03:02.210
era.

64
00:03:02.210 --> 00:03:06.100
I would say kind of think tank slash group now control was basically a handful

65
00:03:06.101 --> 00:03:06.821
of gods, right?

66
00:03:06.821 --> 00:03:10.930
So basically military officials that worked on the side of a really worked

67
00:03:10.931 --> 00:03:11.800
alongside Boulevard,

68
00:03:11.830 --> 00:03:16.060
Trask and looked at the idea of basically trying to stop future crises before

69
00:03:16.061 --> 00:03:17.080
they took place. Now,

70
00:03:17.081 --> 00:03:20.260
the notion of control itself was actually taken by the federal government and

71
00:03:20.261 --> 00:03:23.410
rolled into what will become project wide awake with the rise of the meat and

72
00:03:23.411 --> 00:03:26.710
population. Right? Of course, that was headed largely by Henry Peter Garak,

73
00:03:26.740 --> 00:03:28.510
but for the most part control didn't last,

74
00:03:28.540 --> 00:03:31.720
super long ended up being disbanded more or less. And of course,

75
00:03:31.721 --> 00:03:33.010
the guy who created it, uh,

76
00:03:33.040 --> 00:03:36.610
general Edward Harrison was kind of thrown away kind of blackballed as a crazy

77
00:03:36.611 --> 00:03:38.590
guy. But the big takeaway from,

78
00:03:38.610 --> 00:03:42.430
from Thunderbolt Ross came with the fact that he was stationed at the Los Alamos

79
00:03:42.460 --> 00:03:44.410
research facility in New Mexico. Of course,

80
00:03:44.411 --> 00:03:47.290
most of you guys are familiar with this as the place where Bruce banner became

81
00:03:47.291 --> 00:03:48.940
the incredible hope for the very first time.

82
00:03:48.970 --> 00:03:51.610
And the idea behind this was that Thunderbolt Ross had been consistently

83
00:03:51.611 --> 00:03:55.960
presented to us as very much in being a kind of prideful man, right.

84
00:03:55.961 --> 00:03:58.870
In the sense that his assignment here at the, at the,

85
00:03:58.871 --> 00:04:01.420
the nuclear research facility kind of him off, right? He was,

86
00:04:01.421 --> 00:04:04.300
it took place before the events of the Korean war and kind of ran through the

87
00:04:04.301 --> 00:04:05.800
Korean war and after the Korean war.

88
00:04:05.830 --> 00:04:08.830
And because of the fact that he had made such made such a name for himself in

89
00:04:08.831 --> 00:04:11.470
the sense that those under his command had actually given him the nickname

90
00:04:11.471 --> 00:04:14.560
Thunderbolt, because he just kind of flew in like a strike of lightning, right?

91
00:04:14.561 --> 00:04:16.630
His ability to fly jets done and things like that, ah,

92
00:04:16.660 --> 00:04:19.960
that it seemed like his entire entirely decorated military career.

93
00:04:20.050 --> 00:04:23.170
It kind of fizzled out with him just working a desk job at some research

94
00:04:23.171 --> 00:04:26.050
facility somewhere. Now, of course, he also spent time with dry and banner,

95
00:04:26.080 --> 00:04:27.970
but one of the big things that came out of this is that his wife,

96
00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:30.160
Karen had only given him one daughter, Betty Ross,

97
00:04:30.190 --> 00:04:31.750
and it died when Betty was in her teens.

98
00:04:31.810 --> 00:04:34.750
The other thing behind this is that because Betty Ross had basically been

99
00:04:34.751 --> 00:04:38.050
brought over to, uh, to Thunderbolt Ross in order to, you know,

100
00:04:38.110 --> 00:04:41.260
have a parent to raise her, he actually ended up shuffling her off to a, uh,

101
00:04:41.290 --> 00:04:43.390
to a boarding school. And then once you became an adult,

102
00:04:43.391 --> 00:04:44.350
she ended up coming back.

103
00:04:44.351 --> 00:04:48.100
Now this sort of wraps around and bookends into the incredible Hulk. Number one,

104
00:04:48.160 --> 00:04:51.310
when you have her encountering Bruce banner for the first time alongside

105
00:04:51.311 --> 00:04:55.960
Thunderbolt Ross and Ross is distaste for Bruce banner initially started out as

106
00:04:55.961 --> 00:04:56.860
something innocuous,

107
00:04:56.861 --> 00:04:59.740
something small because of the fact that Bruce banner was the one who was

108
00:04:59.741 --> 00:05:02.080
running the nuclear project. And it kind of off, uh,

109
00:05:02.320 --> 00:05:05.320
off Thunderbolt Ross because in his mind it was a military project.

110
00:05:05.350 --> 00:05:07.390
Therefore a military officials should be running it.

111
00:05:07.391 --> 00:05:10.270
And because of his decorated history, he felt like it should've been him. Right?

112
00:05:10.271 --> 00:05:10.811
So they, you know,

113
00:05:10.811 --> 00:05:13.930
a lot of that pride kind of coming into foray and the fact that you ended up

114
00:05:13.960 --> 00:05:16.630
having, uh, Bruce banner basically pushing, you know,

115
00:05:16.631 --> 00:05:18.350
Rick Jones out of the way when the, the,

116
00:05:18.430 --> 00:05:21.850
the initial gamble bomb was supposed to go off and then being exposed to those

117
00:05:21.851 --> 00:05:23.560
and becoming the incredible Hulk. As we know,

118
00:05:23.620 --> 00:05:27.370
it basically laid the groundwork for Thunderbolt Ross to go directly after, uh,

119
00:05:27.400 --> 00:05:30.220
after Bruce banner, trying to figure out what in the world was going on. Now,

120
00:05:30.221 --> 00:05:33.720
the other thing that we had going on here was a man by the name of Glenn Talbot,

121
00:05:33.750 --> 00:05:36.690
who at the time, when he was stationed at desert base was basically a security.

122
00:05:36.690 --> 00:05:39.330
<v 2>Chief and a major, uh, but of course he would go on to become.</v>

123
00:05:39.330 --> 00:05:42.180
<v 1>The husband of Betty Ross and, you know, at a future point in time,</v>

124
00:05:42.181 --> 00:05:43.920
but as far as Bruce banner himself,

125
00:05:43.950 --> 00:05:46.530
and the relationship between him and general Thunderbolt Ross,

126
00:05:46.560 --> 00:05:50.910
the other part of Ross's frustration with winning the show is that banner didn't

127
00:05:50.911 --> 00:05:53.010
really live up to how Ross saw him.

128
00:05:53.220 --> 00:05:56.550
That's all a man should be that he wasn't really masculine in the way that Ross

129
00:05:56.551 --> 00:05:57.950
believed a man should be this.

130
00:05:57.951 --> 00:06:01.460
And the fact that Betty was actually becoming attracted to a two Bruce banner,

131
00:06:01.520 --> 00:06:03.830
which kind of him off because he always felt like, uh,

132
00:06:04.100 --> 00:06:07.540
like Betty should basically marry a military man effectively led Ross to this

133
00:06:07.541 --> 00:06:11.380
place whereby Bruce banner was essentially everything he stood against. Right?

134
00:06:11.670 --> 00:06:12.640
And, and in a lot of ways,

135
00:06:12.641 --> 00:06:16.210
banner was just kind of this guy who received this unfair treatment at a man who

136
00:06:16.300 --> 00:06:18.490
is really just unhappy with this life, uh, Thunderbolt Ross,

137
00:06:18.491 --> 00:06:21.670
looking back at his career and seeing how it all kind of seemed to coalesce with

138
00:06:21.671 --> 00:06:24.760
what was basically a desk job and seemed to kind of take away from all of his

139
00:06:24.761 --> 00:06:27.100
great military achievements along with, you know,

140
00:06:27.280 --> 00:06:29.410
Betty Ross becoming attracted to banner banner,

141
00:06:29.411 --> 00:06:32.680
not quite being the man that general Thunderbolt Ross thought he should be, uh,

142
00:06:32.710 --> 00:06:35.170
what basically led to banner becoming just this target,

143
00:06:35.200 --> 00:06:38.350
really just this overall vitriol and the fact that general Thunderball Ross just

144
00:06:38.351 --> 00:06:39.580
didn't really like his life. Right?

145
00:06:39.670 --> 00:06:42.550
And so when Bruce banner became the incredible Hulk, initially,

146
00:06:42.610 --> 00:06:45.670
nobody really knew that he was the whole, except for Rick Jones, right.

147
00:06:45.671 --> 00:06:48.400
He was the only person that ever really found out there did come a point in the

148
00:06:48.401 --> 00:06:49.030
old, uh,

149
00:06:49.030 --> 00:06:52.210
the old incredible hoax stories where it was believed that the hope was killed.

150
00:06:52.240 --> 00:06:56.470
And this led to Rick Jones, basically telling a Thunderbolt Ross and, and, uh,

151
00:06:56.500 --> 00:06:58.210
and Glenn Talbot and Betty Ross,

152
00:06:58.270 --> 00:07:00.370
who the incredible hole actually was that it was banner.

153
00:07:00.400 --> 00:07:01.600
And this is what off Ross,

154
00:07:01.810 --> 00:07:06.520
because banner had seemingly gone from this man who was every ounce, you know,

155
00:07:06.521 --> 00:07:08.140
kind of a weakling effectively, you know,

156
00:07:08.141 --> 00:07:11.380
kind of a coward and the eyes of Ross to a man that basically toppled him right

157
00:07:11.530 --> 00:07:12.370
there. And it just,

158
00:07:12.400 --> 00:07:15.010
it was like this thorn in his mind that he couldn't quite get out.

159
00:07:15.011 --> 00:07:19.030
And so the result was that he became the singular focus of Ross's interest,

160
00:07:19.031 --> 00:07:22.720
right? Ross tracked him down almost every conceivable way. And these, this,

161
00:07:22.721 --> 00:07:24.340
this kind of relationship, right?

162
00:07:24.341 --> 00:07:26.950
The idea of the incredible health wanted to be left alone general Thunderbolt

163
00:07:27.250 --> 00:07:31.210
Ross constantly tracking him down was a mainstay throughout all of the early

164
00:07:31.211 --> 00:07:32.530
incredible hook stories, right?

165
00:07:32.560 --> 00:07:35.050
This goes all the way back to the incredible hope. Number one 24,

166
00:07:35.051 --> 00:07:38.710
it goes into the incredible hope one 45, the incredible Hulk number one 58.

167
00:07:38.740 --> 00:07:42.700
And you have these different things that took place whereby you kind of saw

168
00:07:42.701 --> 00:07:45.970
these moments where the halt might get some bit of a reprieve in the sense that

169
00:07:46.000 --> 00:07:49.810
Ross had kind of taken pleasure in the fact that Betty Ross had actually ended

170
00:07:49.811 --> 00:07:53.230
up marrying Glenn Talbot. It was always kind of this undertone, right,

171
00:07:53.231 --> 00:07:56.650
in the sense that Betty was constantly being lied to by her father and saying,

172
00:07:56.920 --> 00:07:57.130
well,

173
00:07:57.130 --> 00:07:59.680
I want to do is cure the incredible whole realities that he wanted to kill,

174
00:07:59.950 --> 00:08:00.910
right? He wanted to kill him, get rid of him,

175
00:08:00.911 --> 00:08:02.380
or at the very least Panim over and,

176
00:08:02.500 --> 00:08:05.050
and just kind of like break his body down and have him turned into a super

177
00:08:05.051 --> 00:08:08.500
soldier, but there was never really anything. [inaudible] about the desire of,

178
00:08:08.501 --> 00:08:10.870
of general Thunderbolt Ross to find the incredible hall.

179
00:08:10.930 --> 00:08:15.070
Now this point specifically with the incredible hook issue, number 159,

180
00:08:15.460 --> 00:08:18.220
Steve Englehart taken over the title, right? And we talked about the, the,

181
00:08:18.221 --> 00:08:20.770
you know, some of the importance of his run, uh, in our video,

182
00:08:20.771 --> 00:08:23.740
on the incredible Hulk explaining, at least I think we did a reworked video.

183
00:08:23.741 --> 00:08:24.910
I don't remember if we did an update,

184
00:08:24.911 --> 00:08:26.470
a video from your room original one that we did,

185
00:08:26.471 --> 00:08:29.260
that was like nine minutes long back when I first started channel. Ah,

186
00:08:29.320 --> 00:08:31.600
but what you ended up getting here in this, the Steven,

187
00:08:31.750 --> 00:08:35.170
your heart run that ran between one 59 and a one 71,

188
00:08:35.350 --> 00:08:38.080
as you had general Thunderbolt Ross who made a deal with the abomination

189
00:08:39.160 --> 00:08:42.430
domination, at least the idea of it was that it would basically back down, uh,

190
00:08:42.440 --> 00:08:44.560
the incredible Hulk and it would capture the incredible hope,

191
00:08:44.590 --> 00:08:46.690
but ultimately of course we know the abomination failed.

192
00:08:46.780 --> 00:08:51.220
And so this led to Thunderbolt ROS forming a team of Hoke busters inside Canada.

193
00:08:51.280 --> 00:08:52.480
Of course it was done, you know, with,

194
00:08:52.510 --> 00:08:55.770
with permission of Canada's department H but without happened,

195
00:08:55.920 --> 00:08:59.810
this team was basically led, uh, by a man by the name of Colonel Jack,

196
00:08:59.840 --> 00:09:00.710
Amber stir. Now,

197
00:09:00.770 --> 00:09:04.700
Colonel Jack and Brewster was basically captured alongside the president of the

198
00:09:04.701 --> 00:09:08.030
United States and general fundable Ross, uh, by the Soviets, of course,

199
00:09:08.031 --> 00:09:10.880
this story kind of taking place during the cold war is one of the reasons why

200
00:09:10.881 --> 00:09:14.000
you saw that kind of story happening because of the fact that the cold war was

201
00:09:14.001 --> 00:09:15.260
very much a significant thing.

202
00:09:15.320 --> 00:09:18.620
And Marvel back during that point in time running up until about the eighties or

203
00:09:18.621 --> 00:09:19.250
so, uh,

204
00:09:19.250 --> 00:09:23.390
really kept some pretty strong ties to real-world events as they were happening

205
00:09:23.391 --> 00:09:25.340
at the time. That was one of the issues of the cold war.

206
00:09:25.400 --> 00:09:28.850
Is it really permeated every facet of, of American and Soviet,

207
00:09:28.880 --> 00:09:31.280
even worldwide culture, everything from, you know,

208
00:09:31.310 --> 00:09:33.020
mutually assured destruction stories,

209
00:09:33.080 --> 00:09:36.020
all the way up to just how like Soviets are a threat, right? Communism, all,

210
00:09:36.050 --> 00:09:37.070
you know, all that kind of stuff. Uh,

211
00:09:37.100 --> 00:09:40.040
the fact that that general Thunderbolt Ross had been captured by the Russians

212
00:09:40.041 --> 00:09:43.310
was a massive source of embarrassment. And while he was eventually freed,

213
00:09:43.370 --> 00:09:45.950
this led to a tablet being Calvin, uh, captured by the Russians,

214
00:09:46.010 --> 00:09:48.680
which of course led Betty Ross to believe that general tablet had died.

215
00:09:48.740 --> 00:09:51.530
And then it kind of her off and pushed her further away from her father. Now,

216
00:09:51.590 --> 00:09:55.280
instead of identifying this as a direct result of what, uh,

217
00:09:55.310 --> 00:09:58.630
general Thunderbolt Ross had done, and the fact that his obsession with causing,

218
00:09:59.000 --> 00:09:59.030
uh,

219
00:09:59.030 --> 00:10:02.840
capturing the Hulk had led him to this place instead of like mini stories before

220
00:10:02.841 --> 00:10:05.300
it, he basically pointed the finger at the incredible Hulk and said,

221
00:10:05.301 --> 00:10:07.340
if he didn't exist, none of this would be a problem.

222
00:10:07.370 --> 00:10:10.050
And so this was the kind of storytelling that you saw that basically pushed

223
00:10:10.130 --> 00:10:13.760
general Thunderbolt Ross further and further in his pursuit of capturing the

224
00:10:14.030 --> 00:10:14.211
Hawk. Now,

225
00:10:14.211 --> 00:10:17.540
the reality of this is Inglehart had actually left the title before this

226
00:10:17.541 --> 00:10:19.220
particular plot thread was wrapped up.

227
00:10:19.280 --> 00:10:22.970
And so with issue number 179 Lyn wine came over the title where he would

228
00:10:22.971 --> 00:10:25.340
basically write until issue one issue 220,

229
00:10:25.400 --> 00:10:27.680
and what's probably considered one of the most celebrated,

230
00:10:27.681 --> 00:10:29.830
incredible home runs of all time. Yeah,

231
00:10:30.110 --> 00:10:33.410
here is that Lynn wine kind of wrapped up these threads in order to sort of make

232
00:10:33.411 --> 00:10:37.070
the title his own. And then just kind of took off with it by and large,

233
00:10:37.100 --> 00:10:41.210
the idea of fundable Ross for the most part didn't really change.

234
00:10:41.270 --> 00:10:44.990
And this wasn't really anything do you with the fact that it was a dislike of

235
00:10:44.991 --> 00:10:47.540
Thunderbolt Ross Verlin wine, but more because wine,

236
00:10:47.541 --> 00:10:49.880
one of the kind of introduced nuke concepts, right?

237
00:10:49.880 --> 00:10:53.000
And so that's why you saw like Wolverine being bought in when you saw the

238
00:10:53.001 --> 00:10:56.000
incredible health making his way to Canada, different things like that. Uh,

239
00:10:56.030 --> 00:10:57.410
but for thought about Ross himself,

240
00:10:57.411 --> 00:11:00.950
one of the big things that came out of it is that he was basically reduced to

241
00:11:00.951 --> 00:11:05.210
having a nervous break down that after being basically removed from the project

242
00:11:05.211 --> 00:11:09.350
green skin, as it was called, uh, and, and the entirety of the Hulk Buster base,

243
00:11:09.730 --> 00:11:12.620
that Ross ended up suffering like a total nervous breakdown. Now,

244
00:11:12.950 --> 00:11:14.690
originally he came under the care of doc Samson,

245
00:11:14.810 --> 00:11:17.290
and that served the purpose of basically saying, Hey, you know, look, he's,

246
00:11:17.510 --> 00:11:20.720
he's kind of being sort of that. Uh, but for the most part between this, the,

247
00:11:20.721 --> 00:11:23.750
the, you know, capture at the hands of the Soviets, all these things,

248
00:11:23.810 --> 00:11:26.420
they kind of led to the fact that he didn't quite feel like the soldier that he

249
00:11:26.690 --> 00:11:28.010
wants was all led to him,

250
00:11:28.070 --> 00:11:32.270
fully pushing headlong into the idea that the incredible hole basically needed

251
00:11:32.271 --> 00:11:35.000
to be captured by the incredible hole needed to would just be captured,

252
00:11:35.060 --> 00:11:36.590
but to be killed. Now, again,

253
00:11:36.591 --> 00:11:40.370
a lot of the major plot threads focusing on Ross really came with the incredible

254
00:11:40.371 --> 00:11:43.670
Hulk issue. Number 262 is when a lot of this stuff started. Now,

255
00:11:43.730 --> 00:11:48.500
this really goes into what is considered to be the single most celebrated run a

256
00:11:48.501 --> 00:11:50.060
really two runs of the incredible hope,

257
00:11:50.090 --> 00:11:53.920
the first one being done by bill Matlow and the second one being by Peter David.

258
00:11:53.950 --> 00:11:57.250
Now we've talked about the significance of these stories in the sense that

259
00:11:57.251 --> 00:12:00.820
unlike Lynn wine or Steve Inglehart, or even Stanley and Jack Herby,

260
00:12:00.910 --> 00:12:04.480
this kind of notion of the incredible Hulk embodying stories with flights of

261
00:12:04.481 --> 00:12:06.820
fantasy and things like that were really removed.

262
00:12:06.821 --> 00:12:10.360
And instead it was focusing largely on the human element of the incredible whole

263
00:12:10.390 --> 00:12:12.730
introducing things like multiple personality disorder.

264
00:12:12.790 --> 00:12:16.300
The idea that the incredible Hulk is a physical manifestation of the abuse that

265
00:12:16.301 --> 00:12:18.790
Bruce banner suffered at the hands of his father, Brian banner.

266
00:12:18.820 --> 00:12:22.000
Those were all major plot threads that came with the incredible hope line of

267
00:12:22.001 --> 00:12:25.450
comics as it was written by bill Matt Lowe and built on by Peter David.

268
00:12:25.480 --> 00:12:27.550
But as for general Thunderbolt Ross himself,

269
00:12:27.580 --> 00:12:30.150
things actually really cool for his character.

270
00:12:30.240 --> 00:12:33.570
And so starting in the three parts story to hunt the whole, the family,

271
00:12:33.630 --> 00:12:36.480
the dyes together, and sunset of a samurai bill,

272
00:12:36.750 --> 00:12:39.600
Matt Lowe introduced pottery one of the most significant events to happen in the

273
00:12:39.601 --> 00:12:42.330
incredible hope mythos with the death of general Talbot.

274
00:12:42.360 --> 00:12:44.970
And the idea behind this is that with Journal's habit himself,

275
00:12:45.000 --> 00:12:48.270
following the nervous breakdown offendable Ross general tablet was the one who

276
00:12:48.271 --> 00:12:50.100
was put in charge of gamma base.

277
00:12:50.220 --> 00:12:54.270
And the idea was that general Talbot would effectively use his resources to hunt

278
00:12:54.271 --> 00:12:57.330
down the incredible Hulk and almost pick up the Slack offendable Ross.

279
00:12:57.340 --> 00:13:00.090
And a lot of this was based on the fact that Betty Roston basically already

280
00:13:00.091 --> 00:13:00.660
established.

281
00:13:00.660 --> 00:13:03.810
She was still in love with Bruce banner and it actually divorced general Talbot.

282
00:13:03.930 --> 00:13:07.620
And so in the aftermath of this general Talbot actually committed treason and

283
00:13:07.621 --> 00:13:10.980
then was ultimately killed in battle with the incredible whole consult.

284
00:13:10.990 --> 00:13:14.610
And so going into, uh, the incredible hook issue, number 262,

285
00:13:14.700 --> 00:13:16.320
and following the death of Talbot,

286
00:13:16.550 --> 00:13:19.850
that this kind of further the idea of the intention of,

287
00:13:19.851 --> 00:13:23.250
of Thunderbolt Ross to track down the whole end to take him out. And so well,

288
00:13:23.251 --> 00:13:26.070
Thunderbolt Ross couldn't really be given the resources, uh,

289
00:13:26.071 --> 00:13:28.350
to basically hunt down the whole property.

290
00:13:28.380 --> 00:13:31.170
And a lot of this was due to the fact that Congress was devoting resources to

291
00:13:31.171 --> 00:13:31.381
other things,

292
00:13:31.381 --> 00:13:34.410
things as well as general Thunderbolt Ross has many failed attempts.

293
00:13:34.440 --> 00:13:37.560
What the president ended up doing was putting general Thunderbolt Ross in charge

294
00:13:37.590 --> 00:13:41.040
of a think tank that would basically allow general thought about Ross to track

295
00:13:41.041 --> 00:13:44.760
down the hole. The problem with this is that an issue is two 78 and two 79.

296
00:13:44.790 --> 00:13:48.090
This entire plan by the president that was basically formed by Thunderbolt.

297
00:13:48.390 --> 00:13:51.580
Ross was essentially destroyed when you ended up having it established,

298
00:13:51.581 --> 00:13:55.290
the incredible Hulk could maintain his own personalities, his own intelligence,

299
00:13:55.320 --> 00:13:56.160
so on and so forth.

300
00:13:56.220 --> 00:13:59.400
And the fact that banner was basically able to maintain his own identity when he

301
00:13:59.401 --> 00:14:00.630
transformed into the halt.

302
00:14:00.660 --> 00:14:04.230
This led to the president of the United States basically pardoning the

303
00:14:04.231 --> 00:14:06.360
incredible hole of all of his past offenses.

304
00:14:06.390 --> 00:14:08.760
And so what you ended up having was general Thunderbolt Ross,

305
00:14:08.761 --> 00:14:10.800
who was in charge of something called project earth ball,

306
00:14:10.830 --> 00:14:14.070
which basically led to him intentionally committing treason by freeing the

307
00:14:14.071 --> 00:14:15.810
abomination who had already been, uh,

308
00:14:15.840 --> 00:14:19.620
been held in status by the federal government and then working alongside AME

309
00:14:19.740 --> 00:14:21.300
managed to pull it off. The problem is that,

310
00:14:21.301 --> 00:14:24.300
of course the abomination was basically defeated by the incredible hall.

311
00:14:24.330 --> 00:14:27.660
And then when the whole forced a general Thunderball Ross to admit his actions

312
00:14:27.661 --> 00:14:28.650
in front of his daughter,

313
00:14:28.680 --> 00:14:32.640
that this pushed Betty even further away and closer into the arms of banner.

314
00:14:32.670 --> 00:14:36.300
And so what this did was leave Thunderbolt Ross in a state of complete and total

315
00:14:36.301 --> 00:14:39.240
disgrace regarding his historical military career.

316
00:14:39.330 --> 00:14:41.280
And he basically just kind of ended up becoming a wanderer.

317
00:14:41.340 --> 00:14:42.240
But for the most part,

318
00:14:42.270 --> 00:14:45.600
this became one of the most important aspects of Thunderbolt Ross's character,

319
00:14:45.660 --> 00:14:50.010
because much like we had seen with the storytelling of bill Matlock refocused on

320
00:14:50.011 --> 00:14:53.810
the human side of the Hulk, he did the exact same thing with Thunderbolt Ross.

321
00:14:53.811 --> 00:14:55.280
And it was kind of an answer to the question,

322
00:14:55.340 --> 00:14:59.000
what happens when all of his misdeeds and all the terrible things that he'd done

323
00:14:59.001 --> 00:15:02.000
all in an effort to capture the hope basically came to fruition.

324
00:15:02.090 --> 00:15:04.370
And so when that, when, when it all kind of hit the fan,

325
00:15:04.400 --> 00:15:07.430
he was left as almost kind of a shell of his former self, right? He had,

326
00:15:07.490 --> 00:15:10.220
he had already lost his wife at a future at a previous point in time.

327
00:15:10.250 --> 00:15:12.830
Now he's lost his daughter, he's effectively lost his career,

328
00:15:12.860 --> 00:15:15.980
but he seemingly had lost everything. One of the big issues though,

329
00:15:16.100 --> 00:15:19.280
is that despite this work, that bill Matlow had put into the incredible Hulk,

330
00:15:19.580 --> 00:15:20.900
ah, by the mid 1980s,

331
00:15:20.930 --> 00:15:25.580
Jim shooter had worked out a deal with Mattel in order to create toys for Marvel

332
00:15:25.581 --> 00:15:26.060
comics.

333
00:15:26.060 --> 00:15:28.910
The problem is that Mattel wanted an event in order to market these toys.

334
00:15:28.911 --> 00:15:31.100
And so Marvel ended up creating Marvel superheroes.

335
00:15:31.130 --> 00:15:33.110
The problem is that the work that the,

336
00:15:33.111 --> 00:15:36.290
that had been done on the incredible Hulk and even general Thunderbolt Ross and

337
00:15:36.590 --> 00:15:40.130
coders like that, uh, it was kind of wiped away to some degree by Alan Milgrom.

338
00:15:40.160 --> 00:15:42.680
And depending on who you talk to, some people love the work. He did,

339
00:15:42.770 --> 00:15:43.603
others hated it,

340
00:15:43.610 --> 00:15:46.850
but the idea of general Thunderbolt Ross is that he had this sort of redemption

341
00:15:46.851 --> 00:15:50.000
story and a sense that between the incredible Hulk issue,

342
00:15:50.030 --> 00:15:53.780
number 320 running all the way up to issue number 330 in this 10,

343
00:15:53.870 --> 00:15:56.360
11 part series that you ended up having Thunderball Ross,

344
00:15:56.361 --> 00:16:00.530
who basically showed up at the wedding of a, of Bruce banner and Betty Ross,

345
00:16:00.590 --> 00:16:03.740
and that the intention was to basically stop the wedding from happening.

346
00:16:03.920 --> 00:16:06.740
What you ended up getting was the introduction of this kind of living

347
00:16:06.741 --> 00:16:07.790
electricity, Cynthia,

348
00:16:07.880 --> 00:16:11.630
and energy called Zach's that had the intention of like trying to destroy well,

349
00:16:11.810 --> 00:16:12.141
you know, do we,

350
00:16:12.141 --> 00:16:15.470
what villains do the idea was that Thunderbolt Ross had actually stepped in and

351
00:16:15.471 --> 00:16:18.680
basically sacrificed his life to lead the defeat of Zach's.

352
00:16:18.710 --> 00:16:20.150
Now in this sacrifice, this,

353
00:16:20.151 --> 00:16:23.150
this kind of redemption story that Thunderball rasa basically admitted,

354
00:16:23.151 --> 00:16:25.430
he was wrong about everything with regards to Bruce banner,

355
00:16:25.431 --> 00:16:28.160
that he really was a great guy, that he had to basically trust his daughter,

356
00:16:28.161 --> 00:16:30.260
that his daughter knew a great man when she saw it.

357
00:16:30.320 --> 00:16:33.530
And that in this last moment, he basically died in the arms of his daughter,

358
00:16:33.531 --> 00:16:36.410
right. He died in the arms of, of Betty Ross. And so for the most part,

359
00:16:36.440 --> 00:16:40.820
this saw the vanishing of, of general Thunderbolt Ross for quite some time,

360
00:16:40.821 --> 00:16:44.810
in fact, for about 30 issues or so for 36 issues, we didn't really see him.

361
00:16:44.840 --> 00:16:48.320
He did come back and, uh, the incredible hook issue, number 366.

362
00:16:48.350 --> 00:16:49.250
But then for the most part,

363
00:16:49.251 --> 00:16:52.400
we didn't really see him after that until we got to the incredible Hulk number

364
00:16:52.401 --> 00:16:55.040
456, at least not really anything of note,

365
00:16:55.041 --> 00:16:56.990
he was just part of the military and was just part of, you know,

366
00:16:57.020 --> 00:16:59.990
basically there. And that was essentially it. Now, one of the reasons,

367
00:16:59.991 --> 00:17:02.990
or at least I w I would kind of have to assume the reason for this was because

368
00:17:03.020 --> 00:17:06.410
by that point, we were in the Peter David run starting in the 1990s.

369
00:17:06.470 --> 00:17:10.160
And Peter David took a lot of emphasis off of villains that have been around for

370
00:17:10.161 --> 00:17:11.030
a long, long time,

371
00:17:11.120 --> 00:17:13.690
if they didn't really seem to serve a useful purpose of the stories that you

372
00:17:13.691 --> 00:17:15.020
wanted to tell for the most part,

373
00:17:15.050 --> 00:17:18.080
then general Thunderball Ross didn't really seem to fill that role. I mean,

374
00:17:18.081 --> 00:17:21.920
he just did some things, but a lot of stories were based on like the leader or,

375
00:17:21.921 --> 00:17:24.650
or, or like abomination or other characters that we were aware of,

376
00:17:24.651 --> 00:17:27.560
or even just kind of building up on the incredible Hulk mythos itself,

377
00:17:27.561 --> 00:17:29.930
kind of involving a lot of other characters that were going around.

378
00:17:29.960 --> 00:17:32.480
The other part of this is that we were getting into the 1990s.

379
00:17:32.540 --> 00:17:34.850
We were talking about the comic bus. And so for the most part,

380
00:17:34.851 --> 00:17:38.210
there wasn't really a lot of room to tell stories involving characters,

381
00:17:38.211 --> 00:17:41.390
villains, or otherwise, that really didn't draw a lot of fanfare.

382
00:17:41.420 --> 00:17:45.380
And because comics in the 1990s were just super high octane and super fast

383
00:17:45.381 --> 00:17:45.740
paced.

384
00:17:45.740 --> 00:17:48.950
There wasn't really a whole lot of room to focus on somebody like Thunderbolt

385
00:17:48.960 --> 00:17:50.700
Ross, who didn't really have any powers.

386
00:17:50.760 --> 00:17:54.390
And his only real ally was the U S military that he could use to track down the

387
00:17:54.720 --> 00:17:57.840
hook, not when you were standing in the face of like the abomination or you were

388
00:17:57.841 --> 00:18:01.020
standing in the face of the leader or any of these other super powered beings

389
00:18:01.050 --> 00:18:04.800
out there that could be used to create just super high intense stories.

390
00:18:04.800 --> 00:18:08.790
And so what we ended up getting was basically going into the mid two thousands

391
00:18:09.030 --> 00:18:11.310
with the launch of the incredible Hulk volume two,

392
00:18:11.340 --> 00:18:13.440
and this basically saw the return of Thunderbolt Ross,

393
00:18:13.470 --> 00:18:15.930
but not really the way that we intended. So with Greg Pak,

394
00:18:15.931 --> 00:18:19.080
taking over the incredible hope line of comics in what's arguably the single

395
00:18:19.081 --> 00:18:23.310
most popular run of the incredible Hulk in the history of the entire character.

396
00:18:23.670 --> 00:18:26.370
Uh, we ended up seeing a series of events take place, right planet,

397
00:18:26.580 --> 00:18:28.110
whole world war, Hawk, different things like that.

398
00:18:28.140 --> 00:18:32.250
But the idea was to actually kind of introduce a secondary concept that was

399
00:18:32.251 --> 00:18:35.050
basically new something that we hadn't really seen before. And it,

400
00:18:35.051 --> 00:18:38.850
it really kind of happened as a result of two ideas coalescing at the same time.

401
00:18:38.880 --> 00:18:41.250
So in an interview with the Washington post with writer,

402
00:18:41.251 --> 00:18:45.750
Jeph Loeb Jeph Loeb had stated the idea for red hole kind of indirectly came

403
00:18:45.751 --> 00:18:46.830
from him and ed McGuinness.

404
00:18:46.860 --> 00:18:49.980
The fact that ed McGuinness wanted to draw the incredible Hulk and that they had

405
00:18:49.981 --> 00:18:52.920
kind of had this idea where like the watcher would show up or something like

406
00:18:52.921 --> 00:18:55.470
that. And the incredible Hulk would just get off and punch him.

407
00:18:55.560 --> 00:18:58.800
And the reason for that was to establish the incredible Hulk truly was the

408
00:18:58.801 --> 00:19:00.150
strongest character. There was right.

409
00:19:00.230 --> 00:19:02.430
That there would be some story arc that would take place where the incredible

410
00:19:02.600 --> 00:19:05.400
Hulk would basically fight against all the superheroes on earth and come out on

411
00:19:05.401 --> 00:19:07.830
top. Right. And basically just kind of show to the reader. Yes.

412
00:19:07.860 --> 00:19:11.340
The incredible Hulk is still the strongest guy there around that same time.

413
00:19:11.580 --> 00:19:15.480
Joe Casada had actually either come up with the idea himself or use the idea

414
00:19:15.481 --> 00:19:18.630
that was pitched in the 1970s with regards to the incredible hook TV show,

415
00:19:18.690 --> 00:19:21.810
to have a red version of the whole, it was basically uninhibited, right?

416
00:19:21.810 --> 00:19:24.420
It was just kind of a mindless monster, uh, that wasn't really,

417
00:19:24.421 --> 00:19:26.940
it didn't really have to deal with the struggles of like Bruce banner,

418
00:19:26.941 --> 00:19:29.070
keeping him in check or anything along those lines.

419
00:19:29.130 --> 00:19:32.850
And so these two ideas effectively came together with the Hulk number one.

420
00:19:32.970 --> 00:19:36.060
And this was something that kind of came in the aftermath of the world war Hawk

421
00:19:36.061 --> 00:19:36.391
event,

422
00:19:36.391 --> 00:19:40.650
that where Bruce banner had basically been locked away inside of a prison, uh,

423
00:19:40.660 --> 00:19:42.930
three miles below the original facility,

424
00:19:42.931 --> 00:19:46.200
where he was exposed to gamma radiation, that a new hope book was launched.

425
00:19:46.230 --> 00:19:47.970
There was basically one of mystery. Now,

426
00:19:47.971 --> 00:19:51.060
the funny thing about this is that people had looked at this number going

427
00:19:51.061 --> 00:19:52.290
through forums and checking this out.

428
00:19:52.320 --> 00:19:53.890
People had looked at this and they'd seen what the,

429
00:19:53.891 --> 00:19:55.170
that it was Jeff lobe writing it.

430
00:19:55.260 --> 00:19:58.500
And a lot of people seem to be somewhat disillusioned at the outset because they

431
00:19:58.501 --> 00:20:00.420
were coming out of Jeff lobes, Wolf rain run,

432
00:20:00.660 --> 00:20:03.780
which depending on which fan you talked to was not super well-received.

433
00:20:03.870 --> 00:20:06.090
But the overall Jess is that for quite some time,

434
00:20:06.120 --> 00:20:09.310
we never got an answer to who the red hope was. Instead,

435
00:20:09.380 --> 00:20:12.740
the red hope just showed up on the scene and then was just attacking various

436
00:20:12.741 --> 00:20:14.840
heroes. He was going even various characters,

437
00:20:14.960 --> 00:20:16.640
but he was going after Windigo right. Just,

438
00:20:16.641 --> 00:20:20.080
just characters that were traditionally, you know, villains of the, uh, of,

439
00:20:20.081 --> 00:20:21.020
of the incredible hope.

440
00:20:21.050 --> 00:20:24.380
One of the more significant things that red hope did was actually murder the

441
00:20:24.381 --> 00:20:27.830
abomination. And it was really kind of Jeff lobe and an ed McGuinness,

442
00:20:27.831 --> 00:20:31.340
his way of saying, look like this guy is not to be trifled with, right?

443
00:20:31.341 --> 00:20:32.420
Like the abomination,

444
00:20:32.750 --> 00:20:35.690
just given the incredible holder run for his money multiple times over the

445
00:20:35.691 --> 00:20:37.250
years. Now, the red hope just killed it.

446
00:20:37.280 --> 00:20:40.160
This and the fact that the red Holt was shown to be somebody of military

447
00:20:40.161 --> 00:20:43.040
strategy, somebody with some great history looking in hindsight,

448
00:20:43.070 --> 00:20:45.620
the clues were always dead, right. But for the most part,

449
00:20:45.621 --> 00:20:46.880
we were all kind of wrapped up in the,

450
00:20:47.350 --> 00:20:50.440
and not really able to figure out the fact that it was actually fundable Ross,

451
00:20:50.470 --> 00:20:51.340
that, and the fact that Thunderbolt,

452
00:20:51.610 --> 00:20:55.600
Rawson and missing and comics from up to that point about a 156 issues really

453
00:20:55.601 --> 00:20:58.990
kind of made him sort of out of sight out of mind where you end up getting here

454
00:20:59.080 --> 00:21:00.660
are some events where like, uh, the,

455
00:21:00.661 --> 00:21:03.360
the red Hawk is basically brought together alongside, uh,

456
00:21:03.361 --> 00:21:05.740
alongside a bunch of other heroes and a group called the offenders,

457
00:21:05.770 --> 00:21:08.380
which is designed to be the antithesis to the defenders. Uh,

458
00:21:08.410 --> 00:21:09.590
he ended up stealing like the,

459
00:21:09.591 --> 00:21:12.370
the cosmic power of the silver surfer took the silver surfer,

460
00:21:12.970 --> 00:21:14.560
surfboard killed a whole bunch of people. They were pretty,

461
00:21:14.561 --> 00:21:17.200
they were pretty wild, right? Pretty nuts and, and pretty wild.

462
00:21:17.290 --> 00:21:18.670
But while that was going on,

463
00:21:18.700 --> 00:21:22.270
the next clue that we got in relation to the nature of the character was red

464
00:21:22.810 --> 00:21:24.980
hook that's. It was really kind of building and brewing and,

465
00:21:25.000 --> 00:21:28.450
and going into multiple things until we ended up getting into the world war

466
00:21:28.451 --> 00:21:32.050
Hawks event, whereby we learn that the red Hawk is actually Thunderbolt Ross,

467
00:21:32.051 --> 00:21:34.960
who had been returned that working alongside the intelligence yet,

468
00:21:34.961 --> 00:21:37.060
which is kind of a criminal think tank organization.

469
00:21:37.090 --> 00:21:40.210
That's headed by MODOK the general Thunderball Ross had actually worked

470
00:21:40.211 --> 00:21:41.590
alongside Bruce banner.

471
00:21:41.591 --> 00:21:44.350
And that Bruce banner was instrumental in the death of Thunderbolt loss. Now,

472
00:21:44.351 --> 00:21:47.410
the whole idea behind this was to basically throw fans off the scent, right?

473
00:21:47.411 --> 00:21:50.530
That we're fans we're slowly starting to pick up on the idea that general

474
00:21:50.531 --> 00:21:53.380
Thunderball Ross was actually the red Hawk. This was designed to say, no,

475
00:21:53.381 --> 00:21:54.131
he's not either, right.

476
00:21:54.131 --> 00:21:57.310
To kind of basically eliminate people who could have been the red Hawk.

477
00:21:57.340 --> 00:21:59.740
That's why that's one of the reasons why you saw characters like abomination

478
00:21:59.741 --> 00:22:02.200
killed was one part to establish the power, the red Hawk,

479
00:22:02.230 --> 00:22:05.050
but to also say red Hawks, not some new version of the abomination.

480
00:22:05.270 --> 00:22:06.041
So this kind of, this,

481
00:22:06.041 --> 00:22:09.550
this sort of pattern happened consistently across the board. But of course,

482
00:22:09.551 --> 00:22:12.010
we also ended up learning things like the general Thunderbolt,

483
00:22:12.011 --> 00:22:13.840
Ross who died was a life model, decoy.

484
00:22:13.870 --> 00:22:16.720
The revelation that red Hawk is actually general Thunderbolt Ross.

485
00:22:16.810 --> 00:22:19.570
And that's when things came so drastically with Jeff lobe,

486
00:22:19.600 --> 00:22:23.500
leaving the hook series and an intern, Jeff Parker taking over as writer.

487
00:22:23.530 --> 00:22:27.310
We actually saw the red Hawk because of his popularity being rolled over into

488
00:22:27.311 --> 00:22:28.420
more stories. And in fact,

489
00:22:28.421 --> 00:22:32.140
he actually ends up siding alongside captain America and then eventually joined

490
00:22:32.141 --> 00:22:35.020
the Avengers. You get to the heroic cave story in 2010,

491
00:22:35.230 --> 00:22:36.850
where you basically end up seeing the hood,

492
00:22:36.851 --> 00:22:40.210
trying to capture the infinity stones and basically a new version of the

493
00:22:40.630 --> 00:22:43.420
infinity watch, albeit earth-based is formed by captain America.

494
00:22:43.480 --> 00:22:45.730
And the red Hawk actually gets the power stone, right?

495
00:22:45.731 --> 00:22:48.070
So you saw these small little things taking place.

496
00:22:48.100 --> 00:22:50.860
One of the bigger things to come out of this because of the red Hawk's ability

497
00:22:50.861 --> 00:22:53.470
to siphon off the energy of other people was one of his main stays.

498
00:22:53.530 --> 00:22:56.800
Marvel shook things up a bit by toying with the idea that it had actually been

499
00:22:56.801 --> 00:22:59.110
taken away, but where it was initially restored,

500
00:22:59.170 --> 00:23:02.680
this kind of revelation came out of it in saying that the ability of the wet

501
00:23:02.950 --> 00:23:06.190
Holt to siphon the energy of others was actually quote unquote killing general

502
00:23:06.191 --> 00:23:07.024
Thunderbolt ROS.

503
00:23:07.060 --> 00:23:10.270
And so the result of this is that he couldn't transform back into a Thunderbolt

504
00:23:10.510 --> 00:23:11.230
Ross form anymore.

505
00:23:11.230 --> 00:23:14.050
And it was basically a way from all that to kind of get rid of the old hat

506
00:23:14.080 --> 00:23:16.240
general Thunderbolt Ross stories to basically tell fans,

507
00:23:16.450 --> 00:23:19.060
we're not going back to the age of comics where like the incredible hooks on the

508
00:23:19.061 --> 00:23:20.860
run and Thunderbolt Ross is trying to track them down.

509
00:23:21.090 --> 00:23:22.770
That red hook is basically here to stay.

510
00:23:22.860 --> 00:23:26.730
And it made sense because it was just proved to be so popular at that point in

511
00:23:26.731 --> 00:23:29.220
time, people loved him and they didn't want him to go anywhere.

512
00:23:29.310 --> 00:23:33.350
And so by the time he got into 2012, you ended up getting a, kind of a,

513
00:23:33.351 --> 00:23:35.100
a kind of team called the thunderbolts,

514
00:23:35.130 --> 00:23:38.520
which differentiated from the original version that we saw that was led by Baron

515
00:23:38.880 --> 00:23:42.540
helmet. Zemo this one kind of operated of its own accord and included general

516
00:23:42.541 --> 00:23:44.040
Thunderbolt Ross as the red hole.

517
00:23:44.250 --> 00:23:48.050
The problem with this is that by the time you got into the lead up to the events

518
00:23:48.051 --> 00:23:49.190
of secret Wars, right?

519
00:23:49.191 --> 00:23:51.500
Like most of the characters that we saw at that point in time,

520
00:23:51.560 --> 00:23:54.980
Marvel was basically phasing things out and Marvel was kind of mobile had this

521
00:23:55.070 --> 00:23:57.650
sort of giant checklist right in the background, not literally,

522
00:23:57.651 --> 00:24:00.830
but more metaphorically, which characters stay in which characters go.

523
00:24:00.890 --> 00:24:03.290
And while the red Hawk proved to be pretty popular,

524
00:24:03.320 --> 00:24:06.440
I kind of have to believe that because the new incredible whole film was a

525
00:24:06.441 --> 00:24:09.620
mainstay in the MCU. Even if people weren't super received to it, you know,

526
00:24:09.920 --> 00:24:13.310
whatever Norton going into the incredible Hulk's involvement in the Avengers,

527
00:24:13.311 --> 00:24:16.910
movies themselves, the, the main MCU story, uh, played by Mark refloat.

528
00:24:16.940 --> 00:24:19.700
The idea was that there really didn't seem to be much emphasis on the red whole

529
00:24:19.701 --> 00:24:23.600
consult. And so by the time you got into civil war II, 2016,

530
00:24:23.630 --> 00:24:26.450
you got into the captain America run by Tanahashi coats.

531
00:24:26.480 --> 00:24:29.480
Red Hawk was basically a background character, right? He'd been incarcerated,

532
00:24:29.570 --> 00:24:31.280
and that was essentially it. You ended up,

533
00:24:31.340 --> 00:24:34.430
ended up actually seeing his character killed off in the tunnel. HASI coats,

534
00:24:34.431 --> 00:24:36.110
incredible hope run. And as far as I'm aware,

535
00:24:36.140 --> 00:24:39.860
he hasn't really been seen since there was a bit of a revamping of the character

536
00:24:39.861 --> 00:24:43.760
with new Avengers after secret Wars that was led by Robert Acosta. Ah,

537
00:24:43.790 --> 00:24:44.810
that story kind of sucked.

538
00:24:44.870 --> 00:24:46.880
And that version of the red Hawk wasn't very good at all.

539
00:24:46.910 --> 00:24:50.300
But for the most part general Thunderbolt Ross as the red hope has basically

540
00:24:50.301 --> 00:24:52.970
been gone this entire time. Now, if I'm a betting, man,

541
00:24:53.000 --> 00:24:53.840
they're going to bring him back.

542
00:24:53.870 --> 00:24:57.440
And the return of red Hawk is going to coincide with the introduction of the red

543
00:24:57.680 --> 00:24:58.700
Hawk in the MCU.

544
00:24:58.760 --> 00:25:01.760
That's usually why you see characters like that taken off the table is because

545
00:25:01.761 --> 00:25:03.800
they're going to be brought back at some future point in time,

546
00:25:03.860 --> 00:25:06.860
what that time happens to be. I don't really know what he's going to look like.

547
00:25:06.890 --> 00:25:10.240
We have no earthly clue, but at the end of the day, that's just kind of the,

548
00:25:10.241 --> 00:25:12.200
the bit of a rundown history. Now,

549
00:25:12.260 --> 00:25:15.410
if you want more in depth stuff with regards to, to the incredible,

550
00:25:15.740 --> 00:25:17.900
Hokulea more in-depth than we went here with regards to the red hook.

551
00:25:17.960 --> 00:25:19.610
If you want more in-depth story there,

552
00:25:19.611 --> 00:25:22.550
you can actually find the whole incredible hope run by Greg pack,

553
00:25:22.551 --> 00:25:25.850
which includes everything we covered involving the red Hawk down in the

554
00:25:25.851 --> 00:25:28.280
description, right? It's just this massive, great, big,

555
00:25:28.310 --> 00:25:31.700
huge series of videos that we made. I want to say it's like nine hours long,

556
00:25:31.730 --> 00:25:35.180
right? It's it's nuts. I think it's the longest full story video that we have.

557
00:25:35.210 --> 00:25:39.710
It's crazy how huge it is, but it covers all the red Hawk stuff.

558
00:25:39.740 --> 00:25:42.860
But for unexplained video that we usually try to keep under half an hour. Uh,

559
00:25:43.010 --> 00:25:43.850
we did a pretty good job.

560
00:25:43.851 --> 00:25:48.770
I think there's just a lot that happened with the red Hawk and a really long in

561
00:25:48.771 --> 00:25:51.200
a really short period of time. But with that being said, guys,

562
00:25:51.230 --> 00:25:52.400
we're gonna bring this video to an end.

563
00:25:52.430 --> 00:25:54.920
If you are new here to come and explain and make sure you guys are the sub

564
00:25:54.921 --> 00:25:57.050
button to become part of the Rob port. If you guys enjoyed this video,

565
00:25:57.110 --> 00:26:00.080
make sure you drop a light and I'll, we'll catch you all later.

566
00:26:12.400 --> 00:26:12.400
<v 3>Sure.</v>
