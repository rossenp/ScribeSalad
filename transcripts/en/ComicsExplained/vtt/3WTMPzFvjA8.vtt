4
00:00:11.040 --> 00:00:11.870
What's going on guys.

5
00:00:11.870 --> 00:00:15.740
<v 1>This is Rob and we are picking back up again with dark Knights metal,</v>

6
00:00:15.770 --> 00:00:18.800
but this one gets a little crazy. And so I think that before we kick this off,

7
00:00:18.801 --> 00:00:22.190
what we need to do is have a discussion about the overboard. Now, in reality,

8
00:00:22.220 --> 00:00:24.830
it would probably be who've us since we are comics explained,

9
00:00:24.860 --> 00:00:28.790
it would probably behoove us to essentially take everything that's happened with

10
00:00:28.791 --> 00:00:31.010
regards to dark nights metal, and these,

11
00:00:31.011 --> 00:00:34.760
these additions and creations in relation to like how the multi-verse works and

12
00:00:34.761 --> 00:00:38.270
all that kind of stuff to kind of consolidate all of that into a singular video

13
00:00:38.300 --> 00:00:40.580
and then makes sense of everything that's happened.

14
00:00:40.610 --> 00:00:41.930
But for what we're going to do in this video,

15
00:00:41.960 --> 00:00:44.330
we're going to have a conversation about the overboard, right?

16
00:00:44.331 --> 00:00:47.570
Because the overboard plays a role in all of this actually plays a huge role in

17
00:00:47.571 --> 00:00:49.850
all of this. So the way it works in DC comics, right?

18
00:00:50.060 --> 00:00:51.920
Leaving out like the dark multiverse and all that kind of stuff.

19
00:00:51.950 --> 00:00:56.300
The way this works in DC comics is that you have like a singular universe and DC

20
00:00:56.301 --> 00:00:59.720
uses numerical designations for their universes. But unlike Marvel,

21
00:01:00.050 --> 00:01:03.770
whereas arbitrarily established DC doesn't order, right? So you have earth zero,

22
00:01:03.800 --> 00:01:06.740
then you have earth one, then you have earth two, you have earth three, right?

23
00:01:06.741 --> 00:01:08.990
It's kind of how their whole thing goes and works forward.

24
00:01:08.991 --> 00:01:11.300
From there something like zero or earth prime,

25
00:01:11.330 --> 00:01:14.990
that's where you read most of these DC comics ever since the new 52.

26
00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:18.080
Now outside of these individual universes,

27
00:01:18.110 --> 00:01:20.540
you have of course the multi-verse and you guys know this stuff,

28
00:01:20.690 --> 00:01:22.940
but you guys have the multi-verse a collection of universes.

29
00:01:23.030 --> 00:01:26.450
The presence is basically the one who created the multi-verse right.

30
00:01:26.451 --> 00:01:29.330
That's kind of been established over the years in different countries crisis on

31
00:01:29.331 --> 00:01:32.030
infinite earths, the subsequent stories that we've seen, like doomsday,

32
00:01:32.330 --> 00:01:35.930
which referenced a crisis on infinite earths and solidified the creation of the

33
00:01:35.931 --> 00:01:40.070
multi-verse by the hand of the presence in the DC rebirth landscape whites,

34
00:01:40.090 --> 00:01:41.540
we know it's still in continuity,

35
00:01:41.570 --> 00:01:46.490
but the big question to ask here is if the presence created the multi-verse who

36
00:01:46.491 --> 00:01:49.670
created the presence. So that's where the omnivorous comes into play.

37
00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:51.440
And we've talked about this, a Marvel colleagues, right?

38
00:01:51.441 --> 00:01:55.250
Did the omniverse is basically all the multi verses that exist.

39
00:01:55.280 --> 00:01:58.700
So at the multi-verse from Marvel comics and the multi-verse from like spawn and

40
00:01:58.701 --> 00:02:01.490
like the, like, if it, if it exists out there in reality,

41
00:02:01.640 --> 00:02:03.050
it's part of the Omni verse, right?

42
00:02:03.051 --> 00:02:06.710
It's just the omniverse encompasses everything that currently exists that we are

43
00:02:06.711 --> 00:02:09.680
currently aware of. Right? So our universe and assuming that we,

44
00:02:09.681 --> 00:02:12.680
as human beings here in the real world are part of a multi-verse and includes

45
00:02:12.681 --> 00:02:13.880
our multi-verse as well.

46
00:02:13.970 --> 00:02:18.800
And so the over void was kind of like this introduction by grant Morrison that

47
00:02:18.801 --> 00:02:22.490
was designed to take the place of just saying like all people in creation right

48
00:02:22.491 --> 00:02:25.430
now by and large grant Morrison did it in relation to DC comics.

49
00:02:25.460 --> 00:02:26.960
But if you look at the nature of grant Morrison,

50
00:02:27.020 --> 00:02:30.560
it kind of expands beyond DC comics. And so what we kind of do is we can,

51
00:02:30.561 --> 00:02:33.110
we can look at like the real world here. And we can say, like,

52
00:02:33.140 --> 00:02:35.690
in the 1930s you had like Malcolm Wheeler Nicholson,

53
00:02:35.691 --> 00:02:39.350
and you had Harry Donenfeld and you had an X games and you had Robert Kantor and

54
00:02:39.351 --> 00:02:43.310
you had Gardner Fox. And these were the people who basically created DC comics,

55
00:02:43.340 --> 00:02:45.260
as we know it today. And then in the 1930s,

56
00:02:45.261 --> 00:02:47.810
you also had like Jack Kirby and you had Joe Simon.

57
00:02:47.840 --> 00:02:50.060
They were the ones who created people like captain America.

58
00:02:50.120 --> 00:02:51.260
And that over the years,

59
00:02:51.261 --> 00:02:54.140
different writers have contributed to characters in different ways, right?

60
00:02:54.141 --> 00:02:55.970
Bob Kane, bill finger created Batman.

61
00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:57.530
It was just kind of the way these things work.

62
00:02:57.560 --> 00:03:01.330
And so when grant Morrison created over void in, in final crisis,

63
00:03:01.360 --> 00:03:05.520
instead of saying like once upon a time there was Gardner Fox and Maxine and

64
00:03:05.521 --> 00:03:08.220
Robert Canterbury and Harry Donenfeld and Malcolm William Nicholson,

65
00:03:08.250 --> 00:03:11.760
and Gardner Fox and Stan Lee, Jack Hurdy, and Joe Simon,

66
00:03:11.790 --> 00:03:14.820
instead of like running off all these names, he was just like, in the beginning,

67
00:03:14.821 --> 00:03:17.790
there was the overboard. And that's why you basically have this kind of, this,

68
00:03:17.800 --> 00:03:21.330
this depiction in the sense that the over void did not initially become aware of

69
00:03:21.331 --> 00:03:23.310
the fact that the DC multi-verse existed.

70
00:03:23.370 --> 00:03:26.310
Because if you apply this kind of meta textual concept to it,

71
00:03:26.370 --> 00:03:30.240
it was basically grant Morrison saying before these guys created DC comics and

72
00:03:30.241 --> 00:03:33.630
Marvel comics, they had lives, they had wives and they had kids and they had,

73
00:03:33.840 --> 00:03:34.231
you know,

74
00:03:34.231 --> 00:03:37.170
friends and family and they were going to school and all that kind of stuff.

75
00:03:37.200 --> 00:03:37.351
Right.

76
00:03:37.351 --> 00:03:40.140
And it wasn't until later on in their life that they decided to start creating

77
00:03:40.141 --> 00:03:42.990
comic books. And that's when they became aware of the existence of things.

78
00:03:42.991 --> 00:03:45.240
Right? So it's super meta textual,

79
00:03:45.300 --> 00:03:47.670
and it can be difficult to wrap your head around, but there's no,

80
00:03:47.671 --> 00:03:50.400
there's no denying that. Like, it can be difficult to wrap your head around,

81
00:03:50.430 --> 00:03:53.460
but that's kind of how all this, this whole over void thing works.

82
00:03:53.490 --> 00:03:57.090
And so the idea and the reason why this matters is because as we get into this,

83
00:03:57.091 --> 00:04:01.050
of course, we've had, Metron, who's been dead for quite some time in DC comics,

84
00:04:01.051 --> 00:04:02.070
right? He's been dead for a while.

85
00:04:02.080 --> 00:04:04.320
I think ever since the events of dark side war,

86
00:04:04.350 --> 00:04:08.790
but with the Batman who laughs basically achieving the full totality of Dr.

87
00:04:08.791 --> 00:04:13.740
Manhattan's powers and becoming this just crazy powerful multi-vessel source of

88
00:04:13.741 --> 00:04:14.160
energy.

89
00:04:14.160 --> 00:04:17.880
The first thing he does is challenged Perpetua because Perpetua seems to more or

90
00:04:17.881 --> 00:04:19.410
less be equal to himself in power.

91
00:04:19.470 --> 00:04:23.160
And these two beings are fighting quite literally for the fate of the

92
00:04:23.161 --> 00:04:25.770
multi-verse. If you guys are a little confused, you know,

93
00:04:25.780 --> 00:04:27.200
a little ConFuzzled in terms of like the,

94
00:04:27.330 --> 00:04:30.000
the level of power we're talking about here to put this into context,

95
00:04:30.030 --> 00:04:33.240
this was like when the specter and the ante monitor fought during crisis on

96
00:04:33.241 --> 00:04:33.930
infinite earths, right?

97
00:04:33.930 --> 00:04:36.510
It was their fight that destroyed what was left of the multi-verse, right.

98
00:04:36.511 --> 00:04:39.090
It was just them fighting that laid waste to basically everything.

99
00:04:39.120 --> 00:04:43.050
But you're basically talking about two insanely powerful beings here.

100
00:04:43.430 --> 00:04:46.380
The reason why this matters is because while all this has been happening,

101
00:04:46.620 --> 00:04:48.720
spinning dark nights, metal, and the, and, and you know,

102
00:04:48.750 --> 00:04:51.360
the Batman who laughs gaining all this power. And so and so forth,

103
00:04:51.420 --> 00:04:55.860
the over void has been watching. And the over void is actually curious.

104
00:04:55.861 --> 00:05:00.000
And so what the Overwatch does is it basically sends an Emissary into the main

105
00:05:00.001 --> 00:05:03.030
DC universe right into, into this particular place right here.

106
00:05:03.031 --> 00:05:05.070
I guess we can kind of call it the multi-verse if we want to.

107
00:05:05.100 --> 00:05:08.790
But basically this being shows up here, it's kind of a chronicler of sorts.

108
00:05:08.800 --> 00:05:11.700
And it's curious, right? It's curious, what's going on here.

109
00:05:11.730 --> 00:05:14.790
And so what it ends up doing is basically teleporting to the hellscape right?

110
00:05:14.790 --> 00:05:17.760
Which is premise previously Femiscura and it comes across the joker,

111
00:05:17.790 --> 00:05:20.700
the first person at meets. And it's like, are you the one who drew me here?

112
00:05:20.790 --> 00:05:23.580
Right? Are you the one whose presence drew me to this place?

113
00:05:23.581 --> 00:05:26.370
And then he immediately kind of picks up and says, no, you're just the joker,

114
00:05:26.400 --> 00:05:29.010
right? Like if anything, you're a nuisance on your earth. But aside from that,

115
00:05:29.040 --> 00:05:30.870
you're wildly insignificant, right?

116
00:05:30.871 --> 00:05:32.610
You don't really matter in the greater scheme of things.

117
00:05:32.640 --> 00:05:34.680
And then he basically ends up moving to the next cell.

118
00:05:34.740 --> 00:05:37.350
And that's when he comes across Roger Hayden, the psychopath.

119
00:05:37.590 --> 00:05:40.770
And the reason why he grabs a psycho pirate is because remember where you've had

120
00:05:40.771 --> 00:05:44.280
events crisis on infinite earth and zero hour crisis and time and infinite

121
00:05:44.281 --> 00:05:45.420
crisis and final crisis.

122
00:05:45.450 --> 00:05:48.480
One of the things that we've kind of reiterated here is that crisis on infinite

123
00:05:48.481 --> 00:05:50.820
earths destroyed the multi-verse infinite crisis,

124
00:05:50.821 --> 00:05:54.210
brought the multi-verse back and final crisis made the heroes aware of it.

125
00:05:54.240 --> 00:05:56.760
But after each one of these major crisis events,

126
00:05:56.790 --> 00:05:58.700
you usually see some kind of reboot, right?

127
00:05:58.701 --> 00:06:02.090
In the sense that the heroes didn't remember anything that was going on before

128
00:06:02.091 --> 00:06:04.910
those crisis events were really before crisis on infinite earths,

129
00:06:04.970 --> 00:06:06.440
infinite crisis and final crisis.

130
00:06:06.470 --> 00:06:09.860
Weren't really as grandiose in scale as the original crisis of it.

131
00:06:09.861 --> 00:06:13.850
That's why I say DC's only ever rebooted twice the original crisis event and the

132
00:06:13.851 --> 00:06:16.460
new 52 by, but even when we go into new 52,

133
00:06:16.490 --> 00:06:19.280
most people don't remember anything before the new 52.

134
00:06:19.310 --> 00:06:22.190
It's why Barry Allen initially forgot who Wally West was. It's why,

135
00:06:22.191 --> 00:06:26.390
when you had pre new 52 Superman who showed up in the new 52 universe,

136
00:06:26.420 --> 00:06:28.130
people didn't initially know who he was.

137
00:06:28.131 --> 00:06:31.430
And then you had the whole Superman reborn story arc where basically him and the

138
00:06:31.431 --> 00:06:32.750
new 52 version merged.

139
00:06:32.810 --> 00:06:35.180
And then you got like the original Superman as we know him. Right.

140
00:06:35.181 --> 00:06:37.400
That kind of a thing. It was kind of a wonky story,

141
00:06:37.401 --> 00:06:40.880
but the long and short of this is that cycle pirate does remember all of that.

142
00:06:41.150 --> 00:06:44.660
But psycho pirate remembers life remembers how things work before the events of

143
00:06:44.661 --> 00:06:47.630
crisis on infinite ERs. And he remembers how things were after that.

144
00:06:47.660 --> 00:06:50.840
And he remembers everything before the events of flashpoint and he knows

145
00:06:50.841 --> 00:06:52.850
everything that's been going on since. Right?

146
00:06:52.851 --> 00:06:57.350
So he's the only true source of knowledge in so far as the entire timeline

147
00:06:57.380 --> 00:07:00.530
before, during and after the crises that DCS had.

148
00:07:00.590 --> 00:07:03.140
And so one of the things this guy basically says here is that he's,

149
00:07:03.290 --> 00:07:05.930
he's known as chronicler, right? That's basically his name, right?

150
00:07:05.931 --> 00:07:09.890
His name is chronicler. And that he has what's called the codex Omni versa.

151
00:07:09.920 --> 00:07:14.000
And that he is a person that sent into a universe to Chronicle the universe

152
00:07:14.030 --> 00:07:17.060
document. Why it is that it's dying and then leave. And that's basically,

153
00:07:17.061 --> 00:07:19.640
it that's his whole purpose. He's more or less just like a librarian,

154
00:07:20.030 --> 00:07:24.000
a chronicler. And so as he goes through here, and as he looks into the mind of,

155
00:07:24.001 --> 00:07:27.230
of psycho pirate, he basically recalls everything, right?

156
00:07:27.231 --> 00:07:31.880
Like the original justice society of America before the events of prices on

157
00:07:31.881 --> 00:07:34.280
offenders, the heroes as they existed after,

158
00:07:34.340 --> 00:07:38.030
and then everything that came after the event of flashpoint. Right. New 52.

159
00:07:38.060 --> 00:07:39.230
And so when he's looking at that,

160
00:07:39.231 --> 00:07:42.410
like it immediately strikes him as interesting because he's kind of like this

161
00:07:42.411 --> 00:07:45.770
multi versus remarkable, right? It's not like most multi verses that I've seen,

162
00:07:45.771 --> 00:07:48.530
that have been destroyed where there aren't really any superheroes there. Right.

163
00:07:48.680 --> 00:07:51.140
Where it's basically just kind of mundane. This is a little strange to me.

164
00:07:51.200 --> 00:07:54.680
And so from there, like it kind of piques his interest, you know? And he's like,

165
00:07:54.740 --> 00:07:56.120
let's see what else is here.

166
00:07:56.180 --> 00:07:58.610
The funny thing about it is that when he explains himself and says, like,

167
00:07:58.640 --> 00:08:01.910
I'm always sent into a multi-verse when the Moseley versus about to die a kind

168
00:08:01.911 --> 00:08:04.520
of strike cycle pilot, like, wait a minute, like this is the end, right.

169
00:08:04.521 --> 00:08:06.440
This is how it ends. The funny thing about this too,

170
00:08:06.500 --> 00:08:10.100
is psycho pirate tries to use as a Medusa mask on chronicler. It doesn't work.

171
00:08:10.130 --> 00:08:10.550
Right. And we'll,

172
00:08:10.550 --> 00:08:12.920
we'll find out more about why it doesn't work here in a minute. I mean,

173
00:08:12.921 --> 00:08:15.950
he kind of offers an explanation and saying that he's incapable of feeling for

174
00:08:15.951 --> 00:08:16.340
the dead.

175
00:08:16.340 --> 00:08:19.760
And so basically it's kind of him saying like this multi-verse is going to die.

176
00:08:19.790 --> 00:08:22.370
And so, because you're a dead man, I don't really feel anything for you,

177
00:08:22.371 --> 00:08:25.460
but the reason why the Medusa mask doesn't work is actually a little deeper than

178
00:08:25.461 --> 00:08:27.650
that, right? We're not really deeper, but it's a little different than that.

179
00:08:27.710 --> 00:08:28.400
And so from there,

180
00:08:28.400 --> 00:08:31.850
he ends up teleporting to another location and is immediately met by like all

181
00:08:31.851 --> 00:08:34.310
these different robots, right? These, these kinds of, you know,

182
00:08:34.311 --> 00:08:37.430
drones and somewhat any wipes them out with a wave of his hand.

183
00:08:37.490 --> 00:08:38.660
And they're all totally destroyed,

184
00:08:38.690 --> 00:08:42.500
which proves to be a big deal because these are the forces of real docks, right?

185
00:08:42.501 --> 00:08:43.490
The son of brainiac.

186
00:08:43.520 --> 00:08:46.670
So you're talking about the son of like a 12th level intelligence who created

187
00:08:46.671 --> 00:08:49.460
these drones. That would be a challenge for someone like Superman, right?

188
00:08:49.461 --> 00:08:53.030
Let alone an army of them. And so this guy's power is pretty high up there,

189
00:08:53.150 --> 00:08:56.160
but as he starts talking to rural docs, but when you think about this,

190
00:08:56.190 --> 00:08:59.580
is it real doc says he's been sending signals into the greater omniverse to

191
00:08:59.581 --> 00:09:02.820
basically find a way to escape this multi-verse before its inevitable death.

192
00:09:02.850 --> 00:09:05.820
Right? So Brotox knows the multi-verse is going to die right here.

193
00:09:05.821 --> 00:09:08.640
Like he knows this is, this is going to happen, but everything is going to end.

194
00:09:08.700 --> 00:09:12.150
And that's why I say dark nights, metal is in effect a crisis event.

195
00:09:12.210 --> 00:09:13.890
It's leading to the death of the multi-verse.

196
00:09:13.920 --> 00:09:15.510
And that's usually what a crisis means.

197
00:09:15.570 --> 00:09:18.150
It means like they're going to reboot or something along those lines. Right.

198
00:09:18.180 --> 00:09:21.840
It's kind of become part and parcel with DC nomenclature ever since the original

199
00:09:21.870 --> 00:09:23.850
crisis event. Right. It's just kind of what it means. Now.

200
00:09:23.851 --> 00:09:27.570
The funny thing about this is that rural docs had registered and incursion from

201
00:09:27.571 --> 00:09:30.330
the omniverse basically, meaning like he registered this guy arriving, right.

202
00:09:30.360 --> 00:09:32.190
You know, chronicler arriving from the AMI verse.

203
00:09:32.280 --> 00:09:34.590
And that's why he kind of knew it was only a matter of time before the

204
00:09:34.591 --> 00:09:37.440
chronicler came here. And so what he does is actually pitch them a deal.

205
00:09:37.440 --> 00:09:38.670
And he says, here's what I'll do.

206
00:09:38.730 --> 00:09:42.270
If you take me out of this multi-verse and take me to a better multi-verse,

207
00:09:42.420 --> 00:09:45.630
it'll actually survive that I will give you all the recorded history.

208
00:09:45.660 --> 00:09:48.840
That's inside the databanks that belonged to my father brainiac, right?

209
00:09:48.900 --> 00:09:52.830
Every world he ever recorded across all of his existence across the multi-verse

210
00:09:52.831 --> 00:09:56.040
right here. I'll give you all that stuff. And so the responsible chronicler is,

211
00:09:56.220 --> 00:09:57.900
well, I mean, I do appreciate you giving me all that,

212
00:09:57.930 --> 00:10:01.350
but I'm not authorized to make deals with dead men basically saying I'm not

213
00:10:01.351 --> 00:10:03.510
going to take you to a new multi-verse. And instead,

214
00:10:03.511 --> 00:10:07.440
what he actually ends up doing is basically absorbing that knowledge from rural

215
00:10:07.441 --> 00:10:09.120
docs and then looking around, right?

216
00:10:09.121 --> 00:10:12.150
Because rural docs offers them an explanation on like everything outside of

217
00:10:12.180 --> 00:10:15.390
earth. The psycho pirate never really functioned outside of earth. Right.

218
00:10:15.391 --> 00:10:18.480
He was never part of the green lantern Corps or part of like the new gods or

219
00:10:18.481 --> 00:10:19.470
anything along those lines.

220
00:10:19.500 --> 00:10:22.380
And so you actually end up having him end up having rural docs,

221
00:10:22.410 --> 00:10:25.170
offering that kind of explanation, right. Showing him that information.

222
00:10:25.230 --> 00:10:27.510
And the crazy thing is chronically, it looks at this and says,

223
00:10:27.540 --> 00:10:31.650
there's so much power in this universe. How could you let it get to this point?

224
00:10:31.710 --> 00:10:32.760
Like, how could you let your,

225
00:10:32.761 --> 00:10:35.100
your multi-verse get to this point where it's on the verge of collapse,

226
00:10:35.250 --> 00:10:36.480
that it doesn't make any sense, right?

227
00:10:36.481 --> 00:10:39.390
You have enough power to overthrow virtually any threat you face.

228
00:10:39.420 --> 00:10:40.950
How could you let it get to this point?

229
00:10:40.980 --> 00:10:44.150
Now we're real docs initially tries to take over, um, take over the,

230
00:10:44.151 --> 00:10:45.810
the chronicler and then says like,

231
00:10:45.840 --> 00:10:49.170
I intend to use your power to leave this place, the Chronicles responses.

232
00:10:49.200 --> 00:10:51.540
Do you really want to see what lies beyond your reality?

233
00:10:51.570 --> 00:10:54.960
Do you only want to see the sorts of multi verses I've recorded as they've died?

234
00:10:54.990 --> 00:10:57.630
And that's when he shows him the con uh, Dakota ex Omni versa.

235
00:10:57.631 --> 00:11:00.690
Now we don't necessarily see what's in the codex Omni versa,

236
00:11:00.720 --> 00:11:03.690
but we're given an explanation of what is in there and what the chronic or

237
00:11:03.691 --> 00:11:07.440
basically tells us is that like among the various multi verses that he's seen,

238
00:11:07.530 --> 00:11:10.590
this one is the only one that really has the kind of power that's being

239
00:11:10.591 --> 00:11:13.710
displayed here that within this multi-verse that exists here,

240
00:11:13.770 --> 00:11:16.020
that this one's unique. Now, if I'm also a betting man,

241
00:11:16.050 --> 00:11:18.750
assuming the chronicler has visited, like the Marvel multi-verse,

242
00:11:18.810 --> 00:11:22.110
it's kind of DC comics basically saying are multi versus better.

243
00:11:22.580 --> 00:11:26.300
<v 2>Right. That's kind of what it is. That's kind of what they're saying here.</v>

244
00:11:26.630 --> 00:11:30.200
<v 1>But the overall point is that there is nothing else out there, right?</v>

245
00:11:30.201 --> 00:11:33.500
And this kind of comes by way of the response of real docs when the chronic or

246
00:11:33.501 --> 00:11:36.050
leaps, right. When the chronic was like, I require more knowledge,

247
00:11:36.080 --> 00:11:37.580
your knowledge is far too limited, right?

248
00:11:37.581 --> 00:11:40.820
I require a better understanding of this whole universe that's out there.

249
00:11:40.821 --> 00:11:44.060
And we basically ends up taking off. But the response of real docs is no,

250
00:11:44.090 --> 00:11:46.310
there has to be something better out there, right?

251
00:11:46.311 --> 00:11:47.840
There has to be something better than this place.

252
00:11:47.870 --> 00:11:50.180
But the response of the chronicler is no,

253
00:11:50.240 --> 00:11:53.120
you didn't cherish what you have or your multi-verse is coming to an end.

254
00:11:53.170 --> 00:11:56.860
And it sucks because your multi-verse was so special. And so like, so it's,

255
00:11:56.861 --> 00:11:58.930
it's kind of like if I took you to a different multi-verse,

256
00:11:59.110 --> 00:12:01.690
it wouldn't be nearly as good as this one. And in fact it would probably suck.

257
00:12:01.720 --> 00:12:04.450
It would be worse, right? So I'd be taking you to a worse place,

258
00:12:04.480 --> 00:12:05.740
which is not going to happen.

259
00:12:05.770 --> 00:12:08.380
And so what he ends up doing is traveling to the moon, right?

260
00:12:08.381 --> 00:12:10.980
Teleporting to the moon in the midst of this massive thing, right.

261
00:12:10.981 --> 00:12:13.710
Between Perpetua and the Batman who laughs right.

262
00:12:13.860 --> 00:12:15.600
The document Hatton who lasts kind of character, right.

263
00:12:15.720 --> 00:12:19.230
He actually ends up picking up the skull of Metro and then basically says like,

264
00:12:19.260 --> 00:12:23.490
I need clarity from one who has seen this universe is I'm seeing it now and

265
00:12:23.910 --> 00:12:26.400
observer. So basically if he wants to better understand this universe,

266
00:12:26.401 --> 00:12:29.850
as it exists in the moment and Metron is the only one who can do that, right?

267
00:12:29.851 --> 00:12:33.390
He's the only one who surveyed the entirety of the universe and gathered as much

268
00:12:33.391 --> 00:12:36.120
information as he possibly can. It's the nature of Metro, right?

269
00:12:36.120 --> 00:12:36.953
It's what he does.

270
00:12:36.990 --> 00:12:40.020
And so what he does here is basically resurrect this guy from the dead.

271
00:12:40.050 --> 00:12:43.410
And so what this gives us is this indication that chronicler is an almost

272
00:12:43.800 --> 00:12:47.220
omnipotent character. This guy is huge in terms of power.

273
00:12:47.250 --> 00:12:51.540
The other part of this is we get some massive explanations and exposition in so

274
00:12:51.541 --> 00:12:55.050
far as how all this kind of hierarchy stands, right. The presence,

275
00:12:55.080 --> 00:12:57.540
all that kind of stuff. And so when Medtronic wakes up,

276
00:12:57.570 --> 00:12:59.700
it's basically like he's been dead all this time. Right.

277
00:12:59.701 --> 00:13:02.400
So he doesn't really know anything about, uh, about dark nights, metal,

278
00:13:02.401 --> 00:13:04.920
the Batman who laughs any of that stuff, he's been dead this whole time.

279
00:13:04.950 --> 00:13:07.380
And so it was kind of like when chronicler kind of explains it all to him,

280
00:13:07.580 --> 00:13:09.060
he's just sort of like, wow, okay.

281
00:13:09.061 --> 00:13:11.640
So Perpetua apparently was locked in the source wall.

282
00:13:11.641 --> 00:13:14.910
She was the creator of this multi-verse as it exists, that's kind of crazy.

283
00:13:14.910 --> 00:13:17.100
Right. She was defeated. She was locked inside the source wall.

284
00:13:17.101 --> 00:13:19.800
The whole multi-verse was recreated by her sons. Right.

285
00:13:19.801 --> 00:13:22.740
And then she manipulated the auntie monitor into becoming the villain that he

286
00:13:22.741 --> 00:13:26.040
was, which led to the second crisis. Right. So crisis on infinite earths. Right.

287
00:13:26.041 --> 00:13:26.850
It led to that event.

288
00:13:26.850 --> 00:13:29.250
And then she's kind of just been manipulating things ever since.

289
00:13:29.251 --> 00:13:32.130
So she could eventually escape the source wall and then you serve control of the

290
00:13:32.670 --> 00:13:34.230
multi-verse. Right. So, it's kind of crazy.

291
00:13:34.231 --> 00:13:37.140
And then the Batman who laughs is a version of Batman from the dark multi-verse

292
00:13:37.141 --> 00:13:38.850
and then he ended up getting the power of Dr.

293
00:13:38.851 --> 00:13:41.610
Manhattan who came here from a different universe. And then it's, it's just,

294
00:13:41.611 --> 00:13:44.940
it's it's he basically gets the full explanation of everything that's been going

295
00:13:44.941 --> 00:13:48.330
on here. And the idea is that as he talks to the chronicler,

296
00:13:48.360 --> 00:13:49.980
the chronicler is saying things like,

297
00:13:50.040 --> 00:13:52.590
I wish to understand why things are the way they are.

298
00:13:52.620 --> 00:13:54.390
How did your multi-verse get to this point?

299
00:13:54.420 --> 00:13:57.540
And the response of Metro on here is I'm a passive observer.

300
00:13:57.600 --> 00:13:59.880
I just watch everything from a macro scale.

301
00:13:59.910 --> 00:14:02.520
And that's when he kind of picks up on the fact that the function of the

302
00:14:03.000 --> 00:14:05.340
chronicler it's a simply observed, but what he wants to do,

303
00:14:05.520 --> 00:14:06.840
it's actually fixed things right.

304
00:14:06.960 --> 00:14:09.900
Is to fix them multi-verse and make it right the way that it's supposed to be.

305
00:14:09.930 --> 00:14:13.320
So when he says yes, right. When, when the chronicler is more or less, like yes,

306
00:14:13.380 --> 00:14:15.810
then at the end of the day, Medtronic is like, okay,

307
00:14:15.840 --> 00:14:17.700
it's kind of difficult to explain, right.

308
00:14:17.701 --> 00:14:20.550
But what are you basically establishes here is that Medtronic itself is part of

309
00:14:20.551 --> 00:14:24.450
the new gods and the new gods represent absolute good versus absolute evil or

310
00:14:24.451 --> 00:14:26.550
seemingly absolute good versus absolute evil.

311
00:14:26.580 --> 00:14:29.580
The nature of these characters and the nature of this is almost kind of meta

312
00:14:29.581 --> 00:14:33.090
textual that you have heroes who exist in this universe and within the

313
00:14:33.091 --> 00:14:36.720
multi-verse itself. And the idea is that the heroes are effectively written by,

314
00:14:37.140 --> 00:14:39.360
you know, DC writers represented by the overboard,

315
00:14:39.390 --> 00:14:42.240
in such a way to where they will always find a way to overcome.

316
00:14:42.270 --> 00:14:44.730
It's why every villain doesn't kill Superman.

317
00:14:44.910 --> 00:14:48.090
It's why it doesn't kill Batman every single time they fight. Right.

318
00:14:48.091 --> 00:14:51.560
It's why Superman hasn't died yet. I guess he kind of did, but he ended up back.

319
00:14:51.590 --> 00:14:55.730
It's why the superheroes basically always win is because it's the [inaudible]

320
00:14:55.760 --> 00:14:57.500
representing DC comics,

321
00:14:57.501 --> 00:15:01.310
writers that engineer ways by which the heroes will always come out on top.

322
00:15:01.370 --> 00:15:03.920
And that's why he says things like the Omni versus finite,

323
00:15:03.950 --> 00:15:07.250
because while the omniverse does represent all things that currently exist,

324
00:15:07.280 --> 00:15:10.670
then there were only so many things that we as human beings have created.

325
00:15:10.730 --> 00:15:13.100
If you go through, when you say like, if you want a catalog,

326
00:15:13.101 --> 00:15:16.880
a list of everything that every human being has created in so far as like a

327
00:15:16.881 --> 00:15:19.460
story that exists out there, then sure. There'd be a lot.

328
00:15:19.580 --> 00:15:21.980
Whether it be millions and millions and millions and millions of stories,

329
00:15:22.040 --> 00:15:24.650
but they stop at a certain number, right? They don't go on forever.

330
00:15:24.680 --> 00:15:25.610
We don't look around and say,

331
00:15:25.640 --> 00:15:28.760
there are an infinite number of stories that we as human beings have created

332
00:15:28.790 --> 00:15:32.720
with regards to things like spawn or like the Twilight zone or the outer limits

333
00:15:32.721 --> 00:15:33.950
TV show or something like that.

334
00:15:33.980 --> 00:15:36.380
There's only so many of these things that we've created over the years,

335
00:15:36.410 --> 00:15:37.490
right over our existence.

336
00:15:37.520 --> 00:15:40.820
Now that number will continue to grow the longer that humanity exists.

337
00:15:40.821 --> 00:15:44.000
But at the moment, right now there's only a only a finite number there,

338
00:15:44.030 --> 00:15:45.920
but the potential is a limitless.

339
00:15:45.950 --> 00:15:49.760
The potential of what we as people can create is limitless.

340
00:15:49.790 --> 00:15:50.680
And so the idea of what,

341
00:15:50.681 --> 00:15:54.290
what Metron says here is that because of the fact that everything that exists

342
00:15:54.470 --> 00:15:57.140
within the omniverse, so like Marvel colleagues, DC comics,

343
00:15:57.170 --> 00:16:00.860
all that kind of stuff that all exists because of the fact that people created

344
00:16:00.861 --> 00:16:04.100
it. And so even if DC were to just close up shop right now, right,

345
00:16:04.101 --> 00:16:05.150
is really what Metro is saying.

346
00:16:05.180 --> 00:16:08.150
Even if this multi-verse were to die and never be reborn, right?

347
00:16:08.151 --> 00:16:11.540
So like DC finishes dark nights, metal and says, okay guys, the book is shut.

348
00:16:11.570 --> 00:16:14.900
They fire everybody. And they say, we're no longer making comic books.

349
00:16:14.960 --> 00:16:18.590
Then like the memories of everything that's happened here will continue to live

350
00:16:18.591 --> 00:16:19.071
on, right?

351
00:16:19.071 --> 00:16:23.030
The omniverse representing Scott Snyder and Jeff Johns and all of these people

352
00:16:23.031 --> 00:16:24.710
who are, who are currently contributing to,

353
00:16:24.711 --> 00:16:28.580
or have contributed to DC comics and are still alive. And even us as the reader,

354
00:16:28.640 --> 00:16:31.760
we will all remember this. Even if we can never read a DC comic again,

355
00:16:31.761 --> 00:16:34.700
after this, we'll all say like, Hey, remember that story with Superman.

356
00:16:34.730 --> 00:16:37.670
That's how those things will live on. And so that's, that's kind of, uh, it's,

357
00:16:37.680 --> 00:16:39.770
it's exceedingly meta textual here,

358
00:16:39.800 --> 00:16:42.260
but the chronicler still doesn't quite grasp it.

359
00:16:42.290 --> 00:16:44.780
And so the way this ends is that Medtronic has fun.

360
00:16:44.960 --> 00:16:47.030
Then it's easier to show you than it is to tell you.

361
00:16:47.090 --> 00:16:50.210
And so what he basically ends up doing is kind of blasting him with the full

362
00:16:50.211 --> 00:16:54.110
totality of what it means to truly understand the codex Omni versa.

363
00:16:54.200 --> 00:16:56.780
He basically gives him true knowledge, like a, like a,

364
00:16:56.930 --> 00:17:00.200
it almost beyond multi-vessel and Omni Versal cosmic awareness.

365
00:17:00.230 --> 00:17:04.310
Seemingly what he does is kind of introduce the chronicler to us,

366
00:17:04.460 --> 00:17:06.410
basically tell us like about the real world,

367
00:17:06.440 --> 00:17:09.140
that kind of seems to be what happens, whether or not that's actually the case.

368
00:17:09.141 --> 00:17:11.660
I don't really know. Right. It's just, I'm just kind of suspecting here.

369
00:17:11.690 --> 00:17:14.090
But with that being said, guys, we're going to bring this video to an end.
