4
00:00:11.040 --> 00:00:13.110
Okay. So picking back up with the last video.

5
00:00:13.250 --> 00:00:16.490
<v 1>And captain Britain, Brian, Bradick being resurrected, uh,</v>

6
00:00:16.520 --> 00:00:18.800
by Merlin and his daughter Roma. Of course,

7
00:00:18.801 --> 00:00:22.190
once he gets back into the main Marvel universe, which is where he is right now,

8
00:00:22.250 --> 00:00:25.490
he ends up kind of traveling back to the Braddock mansion and going back home

9
00:00:25.491 --> 00:00:27.830
and visiting for time. But almost as soon as he gets there,

10
00:00:27.831 --> 00:00:31.550
he's immediately set upon by a handful of enemy forces.

11
00:00:31.610 --> 00:00:35.660
And these guys basically identify themselves as being part of a group called the

12
00:00:35.661 --> 00:00:36.950
special collective now,

13
00:00:36.980 --> 00:00:40.940
but the special collective really kind of comes here and manages to topple.

14
00:00:41.450 --> 00:00:45.080
Brian Brodick quite readily. I mean, not that it's not an absolute, you know,

15
00:00:45.110 --> 00:00:48.230
crushing experience. He's not, you know, completely and totally obliterated. Uh,

16
00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:50.480
but he is defeated, you know, pretty handedly.

17
00:00:50.510 --> 00:00:53.990
And the reason why here is because once the special collective gets their hands

18
00:00:53.991 --> 00:00:55.220
on him and they ended up, uh,

19
00:00:55.400 --> 00:00:57.980
end up taking him to essentially where it is that he's supposed to be.

20
00:00:58.010 --> 00:01:00.980
We end up finding out that he's being brought before Saturday.

21
00:01:01.130 --> 00:01:04.790
And the reason for this is that in the aftermath of everything that happened in

22
00:01:04.820 --> 00:01:05.960
earth, two 38,

23
00:01:05.990 --> 00:01:09.230
that the belief of the Omni Bristol development court is at Saturday and had

24
00:01:09.231 --> 00:01:12.050
failed, but she had done something wrong and screwed something up.

25
00:01:12.051 --> 00:01:14.420
Now there's also a couple of things going on here, right?

26
00:01:14.421 --> 00:01:16.010
And we won't necessarily cover it in,

27
00:01:16.160 --> 00:01:18.230
or it's not really covered in this particular comic,

28
00:01:18.231 --> 00:01:19.460
but we can go ahead and cover it. Now,

29
00:01:19.490 --> 00:01:21.950
this is the early indication of the captain Britain core.

30
00:01:22.010 --> 00:01:25.550
Basically the idea that Brian Bradick is not the only captain Britain that

31
00:01:25.551 --> 00:01:26.271
exists out there,

32
00:01:26.271 --> 00:01:29.660
that every single universe has its own version of Brian Brodick.

33
00:01:29.750 --> 00:01:32.930
And that each one of these versions are designed for the purpose of trying to

34
00:01:32.931 --> 00:01:36.200
protect that particular universe. Now, the other thing to understand is a cabin.

35
00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:39.500
Britain's not really designed to be this kind of all encompassing NY

36
00:01:39.530 --> 00:01:42.890
indestructable character capable of protecting his universe. Instead,

37
00:01:42.891 --> 00:01:47.090
he's just kind of a person who can kind of bring the core together if there's a

38
00:01:47.091 --> 00:01:49.460
threat significant enough or something along those lines. Now,

39
00:01:49.490 --> 00:01:50.121
for the most part,

40
00:01:50.121 --> 00:01:53.450
the captain Britain core on the whole is not really invoked in this story

41
00:01:53.480 --> 00:01:55.100
because it's still relatively new. And again,

42
00:01:55.101 --> 00:01:58.550
the main focus was focusing on captain Britain, himself, as opposed to,

43
00:01:58.670 --> 00:02:01.490
you know, anything else that could have been involved in this particular story,

44
00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:02.271
but for Saturday,

45
00:02:02.271 --> 00:02:05.420
and because of the fact that she's being held here under the belief that she has

46
00:02:05.421 --> 00:02:07.310
failed, when Brian encounters her,

47
00:02:07.340 --> 00:02:09.650
she initially believes that he like enjoys this, right?

48
00:02:09.651 --> 00:02:12.320
Seeing her basically being subdued, being held as a prisoner, uh,

49
00:02:12.350 --> 00:02:14.210
because of the fact that she'd failed in such a way,

50
00:02:14.240 --> 00:02:17.750
especially because she abandoned him and everybody else on earth, two 38,

51
00:02:17.780 --> 00:02:21.080
and kind of just did it to seemingly saver on hype. But at the end of the day,

52
00:02:21.081 --> 00:02:21.740
he says, no,

53
00:02:21.740 --> 00:02:25.190
that's not really my intention here now for what we're seeing in extra swords

54
00:02:25.191 --> 00:02:28.550
right now, which is Saturday and being for the most part in love,

55
00:02:28.551 --> 00:02:31.460
or at least pursuing Brian, Bradick it all really kind of starts here.

56
00:02:31.520 --> 00:02:33.290
Once the trial begins to take place,

57
00:02:33.320 --> 00:02:35.990
we ended up finding out that the person who's presiding over this,

58
00:02:35.991 --> 00:02:39.260
the judge of this whole trial is a guy by the name of man dragon.

59
00:02:39.290 --> 00:02:42.260
And the reason why this is a big deal is because man, dragon,

60
00:02:42.261 --> 00:02:45.170
while being the judge is also the person who's going to take over the role for

61
00:02:45.171 --> 00:02:47.660
Saturday and he covets power. And so in essence,

62
00:02:47.690 --> 00:02:50.870
basically the guy who's going to take her place is the guy presiding over her

63
00:02:50.871 --> 00:02:53.060
trial. You see the conflict of interest there, right?

64
00:02:53.090 --> 00:02:54.740
One of the first things they do here,

65
00:02:54.741 --> 00:02:58.040
when this all kicks off is the universal development court led by man dragon

66
00:02:58.041 --> 00:03:01.360
kind of looks around and says, given everything that's happened in earth,

67
00:03:01.361 --> 00:03:05.880
two 38, my scientific advisors have been, this Jasper's work is still going on.

68
00:03:05.910 --> 00:03:09.630
If we let this go unchecked, if we do not find a way to control this,

69
00:03:09.690 --> 00:03:13.260
it's going to spread from that universe into the entirety of the multi-verse and

70
00:03:13.261 --> 00:03:16.830
that this guy will basically twist and distort the whole multi-verse right.

71
00:03:16.860 --> 00:03:19.230
Meaning it'll have to be wiped, clean and started again.

72
00:03:19.290 --> 00:03:23.370
The only way for us to contain this is to destroy his universe seemingly with

73
00:03:23.371 --> 00:03:25.320
the press of a button, right? The turn of a key,

74
00:03:25.380 --> 00:03:28.830
they wipe out the entirety of the earth, two 38 universe. Now the good,

75
00:03:28.831 --> 00:03:32.430
the funny thing about the Omni Vestal development cord is that this is a concept

76
00:03:32.460 --> 00:03:35.850
that you're not really going to see very often anymore in Marvel comics.

77
00:03:35.880 --> 00:03:39.330
And that's because by the time you got into the late 1980s going into the early

78
00:03:39.331 --> 00:03:42.510
1990s, and the idea of just so many cosmic based stories,

79
00:03:42.511 --> 00:03:44.790
especially when you have infinity gauntlet and the, the,

80
00:03:44.791 --> 00:03:48.300
the idea of the living tribunal playing such a prominent role in that story and

81
00:03:48.301 --> 00:03:50.040
achieving a huge amount of popularity.

82
00:03:50.070 --> 00:03:53.130
But let me try Bina would start to become the go-to source for dealing with

83
00:03:53.131 --> 00:03:54.120
multi-vessel problems.

84
00:03:54.180 --> 00:03:56.970
And that's why the Omni erosive element court kind of took a back seat,

85
00:03:56.971 --> 00:04:00.600
but while that's happening, the fury is still in earth, two 38.

86
00:04:00.660 --> 00:04:04.320
And so even when that entire universe is destroyed, the fury survives.

87
00:04:04.350 --> 00:04:08.130
And the reason why is because the furious power set is such that it adapts to

88
00:04:08.131 --> 00:04:10.320
the powers of anybody at faces against right,

89
00:04:10.470 --> 00:04:12.300
its number one protocol is survival.

90
00:04:12.360 --> 00:04:14.760
It'll do whatever it needs to do in order to survive.

91
00:04:14.850 --> 00:04:16.560
And so when this whole universe has destroyed,

92
00:04:16.590 --> 00:04:20.250
the fury basically finds a way to survive the destruction of this universe and

93
00:04:20.251 --> 00:04:24.030
then just exists in this giant empty void and is constantly haunted by the one

94
00:04:24.031 --> 00:04:27.810
desire to track down captain Britain and to kill him. It never gives up.

95
00:04:27.840 --> 00:04:29.520
That's kind of what we're constantly told here.

96
00:04:29.660 --> 00:04:32.280
And so what ends up happening is we kind of jumped back for a second to the

97
00:04:32.310 --> 00:04:35.880
early days of earth, two 30, eight of that universe when everything popped off,

98
00:04:35.910 --> 00:04:38.610
right? When, when Jim Jaspers first started seizing power.

99
00:04:38.640 --> 00:04:41.520
And when he created the fury and we pick up with captain UK,

100
00:04:41.521 --> 00:04:44.460
a woman by the name of Linda, but we pick up with her and her husband, Rick,

101
00:04:44.490 --> 00:04:45.300
in that universe,

102
00:04:45.300 --> 00:04:48.240
when it was basically them just kind of taking refuge from the fury, right?

103
00:04:48.241 --> 00:04:51.060
At this point, the Fury's killed pretty much everybody, right?

104
00:04:51.061 --> 00:04:52.950
Like gets killed everybody across the world.

105
00:04:52.980 --> 00:04:55.020
And they're really like the only ones left.

106
00:04:55.050 --> 00:04:57.690
And so when the fury breaks in here immediately, awesome.

107
00:04:57.691 --> 00:05:00.600
Andy starts going on a goat going after it. And Andy Android,

108
00:05:00.601 --> 00:05:02.640
to give you guys perspective in the main Marvel universe,

109
00:05:02.970 --> 00:05:05.340
Andy Android was powerful enough to lift Thor's hammer, right?

110
00:05:05.340 --> 00:05:07.110
That's why he's called awesome. Andy. He's a really,

111
00:05:07.111 --> 00:05:10.650
really powerful construct to be destroyed by it like this by the fury really

112
00:05:10.651 --> 00:05:13.470
says something right from there. The fury goes in a miracle, man,

113
00:05:13.650 --> 00:05:15.180
tears them up as well. Like kills him.

114
00:05:15.210 --> 00:05:18.330
All these guys just start falling and dying everywhere.

115
00:05:18.390 --> 00:05:20.820
And it ultimately comes down to captain UK, Linda,

116
00:05:20.850 --> 00:05:23.430
and it comes down to her husband, Rick, and there's nothing they can do.

117
00:05:23.431 --> 00:05:24.030
And so what,

118
00:05:24.030 --> 00:05:27.270
what Rick ends up doing is actually putting her into a universal teleporter.

119
00:05:27.480 --> 00:05:30.270
That'll teleporter to an alternate reality. He sticks her in there.

120
00:05:30.271 --> 00:05:32.640
She basically tells him to look out, he's killed right?

121
00:05:32.641 --> 00:05:36.240
As the device is activated, she teleports away and she watches her husband die.

122
00:05:36.360 --> 00:05:39.480
And so that's really kind of where her PTSD and her anxiety came from.

123
00:05:39.620 --> 00:05:43.440
She was there watching as the fury was killing every single superhero on earth

124
00:05:43.500 --> 00:05:45.060
and there was nothing she could do to stop it.

125
00:05:45.120 --> 00:05:47.280
And so once you get back to the main trial itself,

126
00:05:47.340 --> 00:05:50.120
you have a Brian Britta cruise there basically as a, as a,

127
00:05:50.121 --> 00:05:53.910
a defense for Saturday night. And as soon as, as this world is destroyed,

128
00:05:53.911 --> 00:05:56.160
he kind of starts to get off and starts to freak out. Right?

129
00:05:56.190 --> 00:05:58.700
And that alone is kind of a strike against him by the court.

130
00:05:58.701 --> 00:06:01.310
Why they're just kind of looking for reasons to discredit this guy.

131
00:06:01.430 --> 00:06:03.650
And so one Saturday is able to issue her defense.

132
00:06:03.680 --> 00:06:07.010
She basically says that like the push went exactly the way that it was supposed

133
00:06:07.011 --> 00:06:09.380
to. And it happened exactly the way that it was supposed to. Right.

134
00:06:09.410 --> 00:06:10.940
Everything was fine. We don't know,

135
00:06:10.941 --> 00:06:14.060
like the only thing that we can surmise here is that some kind of reality storm

136
00:06:14.061 --> 00:06:14.811
took place, right?

137
00:06:14.811 --> 00:06:19.010
Somebody somewhere out there did something that basically twisted that reality

138
00:06:19.040 --> 00:06:21.380
up, right? It was not us. We didn't screw anything up.

139
00:06:21.410 --> 00:06:25.040
We did the push the same way we've done it countless times before Brian Bradick

140
00:06:25.070 --> 00:06:28.940
was an unexpected involvement in this, but by no means, were his actions,

141
00:06:28.941 --> 00:06:30.380
the ones responsible for this, right?

142
00:06:30.381 --> 00:06:33.290
There was this fury thing that was out there and it was trying to kill everybody

143
00:06:33.291 --> 00:06:36.230
we got out while we could. And we figured we'd fix the problem later.

144
00:06:36.320 --> 00:06:38.420
And so once that, once that defense is offered,

145
00:06:38.450 --> 00:06:41.210
the expectation is that Brian is going to be the one to testify,

146
00:06:41.240 --> 00:06:43.130
but immediately he shot down by man dragon.

147
00:06:43.190 --> 00:06:46.130
And the idea of man dragon is you basically says this case you're presenting is

148
00:06:46.131 --> 00:06:48.320
nonsense. I don't believe it. I don't really believe anything.

149
00:06:48.321 --> 00:06:50.690
You're telling me right now. Not only that you brought this guy,

150
00:06:50.691 --> 00:06:53.630
captain Brittany here to testify, but I believe the two of you were lovers.

151
00:06:53.690 --> 00:06:56.870
And I believe that he's been instructed to lie in court to secure your

152
00:06:56.871 --> 00:06:59.780
acquittal. So I'm not even going to let him testify in the first place, right?

153
00:06:59.810 --> 00:07:03.650
It's obviously a kangaroo court, right? It's a farce. And so when Brian brought,

154
00:07:03.651 --> 00:07:05.150
it gets, that's it, right.

155
00:07:05.151 --> 00:07:07.220
They basically end up restraining him and they call it a day.

156
00:07:07.280 --> 00:07:10.190
And so Saturday Nene is essentially sentenced to execution. Right? See,

157
00:07:10.310 --> 00:07:10.850
sit sentenced to be,

158
00:07:10.850 --> 00:07:13.550
to be executed really that everything that happened in earth, two 38,

159
00:07:13.551 --> 00:07:14.780
and it's supposed to be the end of her.

160
00:07:14.781 --> 00:07:18.200
What ends up happening instead is that Brian Brodick basically breaks free of

161
00:07:18.201 --> 00:07:18.980
his confines.

162
00:07:18.980 --> 00:07:22.310
He grabs Saturday and along with a handful of others and they basically take off

163
00:07:22.340 --> 00:07:24.530
right. The special collective Saturday and Brian Bradick,

164
00:07:24.560 --> 00:07:26.150
they bail now for the most part, man,

165
00:07:26.510 --> 00:07:29.420
Dragon's not really off about this because in his mind, it's kind of like, okay,

166
00:07:29.450 --> 00:07:32.300
that's basically fine because all it does is just really go more towards her

167
00:07:32.301 --> 00:07:32.600
guilt.

168
00:07:32.600 --> 00:07:35.690
So I can use that against her when she's captured and the trial recommences,

169
00:07:35.720 --> 00:07:38.780
but for the character of Linda, right, captain UK in the main, uh,

170
00:07:38.810 --> 00:07:39.800
the main Marvel universe,

171
00:07:39.830 --> 00:07:43.300
the reason why this is also important here is because she ends up grabbing the

172
00:07:43.301 --> 00:07:46.750
morning newspaper and her worst dreams begin to come from, come to fruition.

173
00:07:46.780 --> 00:07:50.470
When you find out that magnesium Jasper is in the main Marvel universe is doing

174
00:07:50.471 --> 00:07:54.100
exactly what Jim Jaspers and the alternate universe did in our two 38 dead.

175
00:07:54.130 --> 00:07:57.910
He starts calling for superhero legislation to outlaw superheroes, right?

176
00:07:57.940 --> 00:08:00.940
So everything that's happened before is happening again, like to pro,

177
00:08:01.000 --> 00:08:02.890
to quote Battlestar Galactica, right?

178
00:08:02.950 --> 00:08:05.460
And so with the special collective and with Ryan Braddock,

179
00:08:05.461 --> 00:08:07.930
and those guys basically toppling the forces who were there,

180
00:08:07.960 --> 00:08:10.030
they ended up making their escape and they're officially,

181
00:08:10.450 --> 00:08:12.880
officially ended up traveling back to the Bradick mansion. Now,

182
00:08:12.881 --> 00:08:15.610
while all that happens, while that's going on, once they get there,

183
00:08:15.640 --> 00:08:18.580
you end up having captain UK, Linda who shows up here. Now,

184
00:08:18.760 --> 00:08:21.220
normally the captain Britain characters, right?

185
00:08:21.221 --> 00:08:24.580
These different versions of captain Britain from across the multiple are

186
00:08:24.581 --> 00:08:26.650
supposed to be exceedingly brave characters.

187
00:08:26.680 --> 00:08:29.620
This girl is terrified because she looks at what's going on. And she's like,

188
00:08:29.621 --> 00:08:31.810
history is repeating itself, switch to a TV,

189
00:08:31.811 --> 00:08:34.930
a TV kind of broadcast by Jim Jasper's himself,

190
00:08:34.960 --> 00:08:37.660
basically the prime minister of London now. And he basically, you know,

191
00:08:37.661 --> 00:08:40.060
using his powers to achieve that, that goal. He basically says,

192
00:08:40.090 --> 00:08:42.010
I'm calling on legislation to be passed,

193
00:08:42.040 --> 00:08:44.020
to ban the superheroes who are out there, right.

194
00:08:44.021 --> 00:08:47.170
To ban also be heroes in London, right. To get rid of all that stuff.

195
00:08:47.200 --> 00:08:49.870
If they can be trusted, why are they wearing masks? Right.

196
00:08:49.960 --> 00:08:53.470
There are people out there with a huge amount of power that have the ability to

197
00:08:53.471 --> 00:08:57.360
literally wipe out entire right. We have to get rid of these guys.

198
00:08:57.390 --> 00:08:59.730
It's basically fear-mongering. And so following that,

199
00:08:59.731 --> 00:09:02.400
you ended up having Brian who speaks directly with Linda, you know,

200
00:09:02.401 --> 00:09:05.460
and she's like, it's the exact same speech he made in my universe,

201
00:09:05.490 --> 00:09:08.910
the exact same lines, right? The exact same statements, all of it, right?

202
00:09:08.911 --> 00:09:10.800
It's all basically the same thing.

203
00:09:10.920 --> 00:09:13.770
Everything that happened before is going to happen again in this universe.

204
00:09:13.830 --> 00:09:16.290
And there's nothing we can do to stop it. Now, from there,

205
00:09:16.320 --> 00:09:20.160
you switch over to the very little involvement that you get with the rest of the

206
00:09:20.161 --> 00:09:23.400
Marvel universe. When you have Jim Jasper's meeting with Henry Peter Guy,

207
00:09:23.640 --> 00:09:24.750
Rick and Sebastian shot.

208
00:09:24.780 --> 00:09:27.270
And the reason why this matters is because this takes place during Chris

209
00:09:27.271 --> 00:09:29.670
Claremont's run on the eczema. And so because of that,

210
00:09:29.671 --> 00:09:31.230
because Jim Jasper's is a mutant,

211
00:09:31.260 --> 00:09:33.450
it made sense to kind of cross those two things over.

212
00:09:33.450 --> 00:09:37.590
Remember in America at the time that all this is happening with Jim Jaspers and

213
00:09:37.591 --> 00:09:39.750
America, you have operation wide awake, right?

214
00:09:39.751 --> 00:09:42.720
So you have project wide awake being launched by the federal government for the

215
00:09:42.721 --> 00:09:45.840
purpose of containing and controlling the mutant threat. In essence,

216
00:09:45.870 --> 00:09:49.770
Jim Jasper's seems to share the same ideologies as Henry Peter Goddard and

217
00:09:49.771 --> 00:09:50.604
Sebastian shot.

218
00:09:50.610 --> 00:09:54.210
What they don't know is that his intention is not to truly safeguard Britain.

219
00:09:54.240 --> 00:09:55.740
His intention is to conquer the world.

220
00:09:55.770 --> 00:09:59.010
These guys are completely and totally oblivious to the fact that they are

221
00:09:59.011 --> 00:10:00.960
standing in the presence of what is an effect,

222
00:10:00.990 --> 00:10:02.670
the most powerful mutant in the universe.

223
00:10:02.700 --> 00:10:06.690
But we start to see the small little ways in which Jim Jaspers is able to use

224
00:10:06.810 --> 00:10:10.710
its powers and a far more nuanced measure and comparison to his counterpart from

225
00:10:10.740 --> 00:10:13.020
earth two 38 when he has a glass of white wine,

226
00:10:13.021 --> 00:10:16.230
which he despises and he changes it into red wine, right? It's small,

227
00:10:16.231 --> 00:10:16.950
it's subtle,

228
00:10:16.950 --> 00:10:20.910
but it's a huge differentiation because it means that his ability to control his

229
00:10:20.911 --> 00:10:24.780
powers are far more nuanced than the version from earth, two 38.

230
00:10:24.781 --> 00:10:25.800
He was relatively new.

231
00:10:25.860 --> 00:10:28.950
And that's when you have Roma and Merlin kind of watching all this unfold and

232
00:10:28.951 --> 00:10:32.060
they say, okay, the game now begins, right? The test of,

233
00:10:32.061 --> 00:10:34.440
of Jim Jasper's is can he pull this off?

234
00:10:34.500 --> 00:10:38.070
And so what he ends up doing is actually calling a woman by the name of Vixen.

235
00:10:38.100 --> 00:10:42.210
Now, Vixen is a character who was a foe of captain Britain for quite some time.

236
00:10:42.240 --> 00:10:44.880
But one of the things that kind of goes on here in the captain Britain stories

237
00:10:44.940 --> 00:10:47.520
is you had the formation of a group called strike the,

238
00:10:47.521 --> 00:10:51.570
the special tactical reserve for international key emergencies and strike was

239
00:10:51.571 --> 00:10:55.830
basically a organization that operated inside Britain that served the purpose of

240
00:10:55.831 --> 00:10:59.670
quelling threats that went beyond any particular intelligence agency's ability

241
00:10:59.671 --> 00:11:01.350
to handle. Am I five of my six,

242
00:11:01.351 --> 00:11:03.750
whatever those intelligence agencies are in Britain. I'm not really.

243
00:11:04.280 --> 00:11:07.370
<v 2>With those. They're not really equipped to handle people with superpowers,</v>

244
00:11:07.430 --> 00:11:11.180
but strike is. But in order to ensure that strike function,

245
00:11:11.181 --> 00:11:13.460
according to what it was a Jim Jasper's wanted,

246
00:11:13.461 --> 00:11:17.360
he actually orchestrated a situation where Vixen was able to infiltrate strikes.

247
00:11:17.361 --> 00:11:20.420
She's basically a Crow, a crime ward. And so she basically runs the show.

248
00:11:20.480 --> 00:11:20.721
And so,

249
00:11:20.721 --> 00:11:24.440
because she's the one running strike strike is now effectively the personal army

250
00:11:24.441 --> 00:11:25.280
of Jim Jaspers.

251
00:11:25.310 --> 00:11:28.850
And he tells her that like within a week strike will receive direct orders from

252
00:11:28.851 --> 00:11:31.970
the British governor, our government to eradicate all the superheroes.

253
00:11:32.000 --> 00:11:33.740
And that's exactly what happens, right?

254
00:11:33.741 --> 00:11:37.580
That seemingly within like within a few days or so that every single superhero

255
00:11:37.581 --> 00:11:41.540
that we can find is captured. But every single superhero in that, uh, in,

256
00:11:41.541 --> 00:11:44.750
in London itself is captured and they're thrown into internment camps.

257
00:11:44.810 --> 00:11:47.900
And this is all happening the way that it happened in the earth,

258
00:11:48.110 --> 00:11:50.780
two 38 universe, right? Ben interment camp for creative,

259
00:11:50.781 --> 00:11:54.520
for individual superpowers. And out over time, they were destroyed, right?

260
00:11:54.521 --> 00:11:57.430
They were completely and totally eradicated as to what you ended up getting here

261
00:11:57.431 --> 00:12:00.190
is that we're Linda kind of panics and can't really handle it.

262
00:12:00.191 --> 00:12:01.780
She basically storms off and leaves.

263
00:12:02.020 --> 00:12:05.050
She's confronted by the fury who basically managed to find a way to teleport

264
00:12:05.051 --> 00:12:05.920
from his universe,

265
00:12:05.950 --> 00:12:09.040
from what was the two 38 universe into the main mobile universe, right?

266
00:12:09.070 --> 00:12:11.500
The name of the game of that guy's powers is adaptation.

267
00:12:11.530 --> 00:12:15.150
If he has a target he's going after and he's aware that target still exists,

268
00:12:15.180 --> 00:12:17.130
he can try anywhere in the universe.

269
00:12:17.131 --> 00:12:20.280
That's the power of the gym Jasper's bestowed upon it and is in the alternate

270
00:12:20.281 --> 00:12:21.111
reality like that,

271
00:12:21.111 --> 00:12:24.990
that alternate universe version of Jim Jasper's gave the fury the power to track

272
00:12:24.991 --> 00:12:27.060
down any target, no matter where they may be.

273
00:12:27.240 --> 00:12:29.250
And it was probably one of these things where Jim Jaspers did it.

274
00:12:29.280 --> 00:12:32.460
Open-ended never really believing that he would be destroyed and that the Fury's

275
00:12:32.461 --> 00:12:36.000
directive would allow it to actually transition from one universe to the next.

276
00:12:36.090 --> 00:12:38.910
And that's one of the things that makes the theory so incredibly powerful.

277
00:12:38.940 --> 00:12:42.570
This is a guy that can jump from one universe to another tracking a target,

278
00:12:42.660 --> 00:12:45.180
and is designed to adapt to anybody's power.

279
00:12:45.210 --> 00:12:47.730
Now where the theory goes against an attacks,

280
00:12:47.731 --> 00:12:50.280
Linda captain UK from earth two 38, Brian,

281
00:12:50.640 --> 00:12:52.740
Bradick happens to show up just in the Nick of time.

282
00:12:52.800 --> 00:12:55.920
And ultimately this leads to Brian Bradick facing off against the fury again.

283
00:12:56.010 --> 00:12:59.130
And that's when he's like the furious here, right? Like this thing is finally,

284
00:12:59.160 --> 00:13:00.030
this thing is back here.

285
00:13:00.090 --> 00:13:03.390
It killed me before it eradicated all the superheroes on it's world.

286
00:13:03.420 --> 00:13:06.420
There's no real possible way for us to defeat this thing, right?

287
00:13:06.570 --> 00:13:08.280
This thing is wildly powerful.

288
00:13:08.460 --> 00:13:11.790
And so what you end up getting is the special collective responding at the

289
00:13:11.791 --> 00:13:15.780
direction of Sater nein going after the fury to save Brian Bradick and to save

290
00:13:15.781 --> 00:13:19.110
Linda special collective has never experienced the fury before.

291
00:13:19.140 --> 00:13:20.670
They've never come across this guy before.

292
00:13:20.730 --> 00:13:23.400
And so their leader just kind of runs headlong into it. Like, come on guys,

293
00:13:23.490 --> 00:13:26.880
we got this. And their, their leader gets totally crushed, right? From there,

294
00:13:26.881 --> 00:13:29.670
the special collective attacks and they get totally crushed, right?

295
00:13:29.671 --> 00:13:31.920
So like they went into this under the direction of their leader,

296
00:13:31.980 --> 00:13:35.430
believing that their leader knew what was best for them and totally failed.

297
00:13:35.700 --> 00:13:37.200
Right. They all almost died.

298
00:13:37.320 --> 00:13:40.380
And so in response to that special collective is like, we're not doing this.

299
00:13:40.470 --> 00:13:43.040
This is too much right. Like what this is now, this is,

300
00:13:43.041 --> 00:13:45.090
this is way beyond what you're paying us to do, right?

301
00:13:45.090 --> 00:13:47.520
Because they are basically bounty hunters by they're mercenaries,

302
00:13:47.521 --> 00:13:49.440
not really bounty hunters, but they're mercenaries. And they're like,

303
00:13:49.620 --> 00:13:51.540
we're not doing this, right. This is not happening.

304
00:13:51.570 --> 00:13:54.000
And so it basically leads to the special collective bailing out.

305
00:13:54.030 --> 00:13:57.240
But the theory going through and attacking all these guys brings back all this

306
00:13:57.241 --> 00:14:01.230
PTSD, Linda of all the experiences she had, right.

307
00:14:01.260 --> 00:14:04.830
Watching all these superheroes, well, I, and fail to defeat this force.

308
00:14:04.980 --> 00:14:06.660
That's not unstoppable. Now.

309
00:14:06.661 --> 00:14:10.230
The fury is kind of weakened by the special collective,

310
00:14:10.260 --> 00:14:13.200
but only enough for it to basically be halted, right.

311
00:14:13.201 --> 00:14:14.940
Only enough for it to kind of be stocked for a minute.

312
00:14:14.970 --> 00:14:17.790
And by the special collective time to basically get out right.

313
00:14:17.791 --> 00:14:20.430
To basically make their escape there. And so once they end up leaving,

314
00:14:20.431 --> 00:14:23.370
it's really just kind of left to Brian Saturn, Dean Betsy Brodick.

315
00:14:23.580 --> 00:14:24.330
And that's really it.

316
00:14:24.330 --> 00:14:27.750
I just really only left to them to just kind of do the best they can to stave

317
00:14:27.751 --> 00:14:30.050
off this measure of power. And so following the,

318
00:14:30.051 --> 00:14:33.120
the application of all these internment camps, right? All these,

319
00:14:33.121 --> 00:14:36.360
these concentration camps where they're rounding up various powered beings,

320
00:14:36.450 --> 00:14:38.730
they're throwing them in these camps and they're leaving them there with the

321
00:14:38.731 --> 00:14:42.150
expectation or the intention of executing them at a future point in time,

322
00:14:42.180 --> 00:14:46.050
the fury is still on the hunt for captain Britain, but at the same time,

323
00:14:46.170 --> 00:14:50.130
Vixen as the head of strike begins to come to this realization that Jim Jasper's

324
00:14:50.250 --> 00:14:52.250
is dangerous and that he needs to be stopped, right?

325
00:14:52.251 --> 00:14:55.460
There's something else going on here besides the fact that he's just the prime

326
00:14:55.461 --> 00:14:58.610
minister and that he's ordering the execution of all these superheroes.

327
00:14:58.880 --> 00:15:00.650
That's something bad is going on besides that.

328
00:15:00.651 --> 00:15:02.060
Now you'd think that would be bad enough,

329
00:15:02.090 --> 00:15:03.800
but there's something else in the various happening.

330
00:15:03.830 --> 00:15:06.830
And so she travels to 10 Downing street, I think is what it's called,

331
00:15:06.860 --> 00:15:09.350
which is the location of where the prime minister resides.

332
00:15:09.380 --> 00:15:11.180
Basically kind of like Britain's version of the white house.

333
00:15:11.240 --> 00:15:13.280
If there was such a thing British members of the Rob poor,

334
00:15:13.310 --> 00:15:15.890
you guys can correct me on that. But as soon as she gets in there,

335
00:15:15.950 --> 00:15:17.330
everything is topsy turvy.

336
00:15:17.530 --> 00:15:19.600
<v 3>And that's when she realizes she screwed up,</v>

337
00:15:21.310 --> 00:15:22.570
she screwed up in the worst way.

338
00:15:22.660 --> 00:15:23.350
<v 2>That, uh,</v>

339
00:15:23.350 --> 00:15:26.830
he starts using his powers and stretching out and stirring up her henchmen,

340
00:15:26.831 --> 00:15:30.040
turning them into like these just kind of monstrous and grotesque things.

341
00:15:30.100 --> 00:15:31.060
And then he in turn,

342
00:15:31.061 --> 00:15:35.710
uses his powers and transforms her into an actual Vixen right into a female Fox.

343
00:15:35.740 --> 00:15:39.700
And so again, the power of Jim Jasper is being able to rematerialize things,

344
00:15:39.760 --> 00:15:41.890
transform a person into something else.

345
00:15:41.920 --> 00:15:44.800
That's the kind of power that we're talking about here. And so from there,

346
00:15:44.920 --> 00:15:46.360
you basically pick up with, uh,

347
00:15:46.361 --> 00:15:50.710
with Brian coming to this realization that with Jim Jasper's existing in his

348
00:15:50.711 --> 00:15:52.660
universe, that he has to confront him, right.

349
00:15:52.661 --> 00:15:55.420
That he has to confront Jim Jasper's head on. And so once he ends up,

350
00:15:55.421 --> 00:15:58.090
what he ends up doing is traveling again to Downey street itself.

351
00:15:58.120 --> 00:16:01.000
And as soon as, as he walks in there, everything's on fire.

352
00:16:01.001 --> 00:16:02.830
Everything's kind of twisting, turning, right?

353
00:16:02.830 --> 00:16:04.330
It's all completely and totally screwed up.

354
00:16:04.331 --> 00:16:07.180
The laws of physics have completely and totally gone awry here.

355
00:16:07.270 --> 00:16:10.720
And so once he opens the door, he's kind of met by this statement, right?

356
00:16:10.721 --> 00:16:13.810
The statement where he's, he's basically told, you know, can I help you, sir?

357
00:16:13.840 --> 00:16:16.480
You appear to be lost, lost in the fun house.

358
00:16:16.510 --> 00:16:21.400
And it's just this enormous receipt of Jim Jasper's this just huge and scale

359
00:16:21.401 --> 00:16:22.630
right there. Seemingly be like,

360
00:16:22.631 --> 00:16:25.330
he literally walked into his office and it turned into a universe.

361
00:16:25.390 --> 00:16:29.020
That's the power of Jim Jasper's to skew and to break the laws of physics. Now,

362
00:16:29.050 --> 00:16:31.120
from there, you ended up picking up with, uh,

363
00:16:31.150 --> 00:16:33.160
with Saturnian confronting Linda and we're,

364
00:16:33.161 --> 00:16:35.710
Linda's kind of terrified by everything going on. She was like,

365
00:16:35.740 --> 00:16:38.050
you have to go help him, right? Like he can't do this on his own.

366
00:16:38.080 --> 00:16:40.390
You have to go help him. Like you're our only real chance here.

367
00:16:40.420 --> 00:16:43.570
And she's kind of gripped by fear, paralyzed by fear, anxiety,

368
00:16:43.630 --> 00:16:46.180
the PTSD she's experienced the terrible situations.

369
00:16:46.240 --> 00:16:48.970
So Saturday starts goading her while she's like, you're a cower.

370
00:16:48.990 --> 00:16:51.310
Then you let your world die. You let your lover die.

371
00:16:51.340 --> 00:16:54.040
You let everybody that you care about die because you're a coward.

372
00:16:54.070 --> 00:16:56.290
You're no measure of a captain Britain at all, right?

373
00:16:56.350 --> 00:16:59.830
Like we failed Merlin and Roma. They failed in bringing you on. Right.

374
00:16:59.831 --> 00:17:02.290
You are not any kind of real measure of a superhero.

375
00:17:02.320 --> 00:17:06.100
I know that because you're sitting here sniffling like a little child afraid of

376
00:17:06.101 --> 00:17:08.650
the big, bad guy. And that's when Linda starts to freak out,

377
00:17:08.680 --> 00:17:12.610
finally regains her courage and the face of her anger and then says, okay, fine.

378
00:17:12.640 --> 00:17:16.120
So like she ended up Donnie or captain UK uniform intending to go directly

379
00:17:16.121 --> 00:17:19.240
after, uh, after captain Britain and to help save him from,

380
00:17:19.241 --> 00:17:21.610
from Jim Jasper's right. To help them defeat Jim Jaspers.

381
00:17:21.670 --> 00:17:24.400
And the funny thing about this is that you end up having this thing where you

382
00:17:24.401 --> 00:17:27.190
have captain Britain, this, this is, this is, this is kind of nuts here, right?

383
00:17:27.191 --> 00:17:31.030
This is, this is immature stuff. This is crazy. He confronts the Jim Jaspers.

384
00:17:31.180 --> 00:17:34.450
And he says like, if you're even remotely saying you can't do this ride,

385
00:17:34.451 --> 00:17:37.600
Jim Joshua is like, I'm not, I'm not saying, and I can do this. And he's like,

386
00:17:37.601 --> 00:17:40.780
fine. Then I'll fight you with every breath in my body.

387
00:17:40.840 --> 00:17:43.540
And then he suddenly wakes up. He's there with Jack doll.

388
00:17:43.541 --> 00:17:46.150
He's there with Saturday. And he's like, jacked off. I thought you were dead.

389
00:17:46.151 --> 00:17:48.850
He was like, no, man, like we're facing off against some enemies here,

390
00:17:48.851 --> 00:17:51.510
but you've just been babbling, like a madman. Right.

391
00:17:51.570 --> 00:17:54.990
You just been battling like a madman going on about nothing is everything. Okay.

392
00:17:55.050 --> 00:17:57.630
And so you're kind of given this indication that what we've been experiencing

393
00:17:57.631 --> 00:17:59.670
here in this universe is actually a dream right.

394
00:17:59.671 --> 00:18:01.380
In the main Marvel universe is actually a dream.

395
00:18:01.440 --> 00:18:04.020
And instead they're just kind of facing off against this crazy threat.

396
00:18:04.050 --> 00:18:05.610
But as he's talking to Jack Dawn,

397
00:18:05.611 --> 00:18:07.980
as he's talking to Saturday and he kind of reaches over,

398
00:18:07.981 --> 00:18:10.590
he pulls down what looks like this giant sheet, this fabric.

399
00:18:10.650 --> 00:18:13.220
And like literally the whole scene comes tearing down. Well,

400
00:18:13.221 --> 00:18:15.660
like a piece of paper. And then suddenly he's at a hospital and it's like,

401
00:18:15.900 --> 00:18:18.210
nurse he's awake. Right? Like you can't possibly have. Right. I mean like,

402
00:18:18.211 --> 00:18:21.180
this is, this is crazy that he's basically talking to his mother. Right.

403
00:18:21.181 --> 00:18:24.210
And it's, it's kinda like, you know, like, this is, this is sort of nuts, right?

404
00:18:24.211 --> 00:18:27.050
This is kind of crazy. Like, you know, he has amnesia, you know, and that,

405
00:18:27.051 --> 00:18:29.890
that he's finally awake, you know? And that he was in a car accident up in,

406
00:18:29.891 --> 00:18:33.720
in dark more. So he never became captain Britain. This reality starts shifting.

407
00:18:33.810 --> 00:18:36.540
And that's when you have him pop back up to Jim Jasper. And he's like you said,

408
00:18:36.541 --> 00:18:39.630
you were telling me something about fighting me with every breath in your body.

409
00:18:39.660 --> 00:18:43.260
Like you're hopelessly outclassed. That's the power of Jasper's right?

410
00:18:43.290 --> 00:18:46.590
Like imagine a story, like imagine the events of house of M that's,

411
00:18:46.591 --> 00:18:48.720
what Jasper's is doing here to captain Britain.

412
00:18:48.780 --> 00:18:51.420
That's a level of power we're talking about here. Guys,

413
00:18:51.450 --> 00:18:55.590
a guy who could basically rewrite all of reality around a singular person and

414
00:18:55.591 --> 00:18:58.410
then trick them into believing that things are the way they are screwing with

415
00:18:58.411 --> 00:19:00.540
his head. Of course, you ended up having Ryan who,

416
00:19:00.541 --> 00:19:03.000
once he realizes what's going on, he's like, you don't belong here. Right.

417
00:19:03.030 --> 00:19:04.200
This power you have, you know,

418
00:19:04.201 --> 00:19:06.060
you're using it for evil means like I'm going to kill you.

419
00:19:06.060 --> 00:19:08.850
I'm going to destroy you. That's when Jasper starts messing with him again,

420
00:19:08.851 --> 00:19:11.640
right. Snapping his fingers. He's in hell snap, his fingers. Again, he's in,

421
00:19:11.670 --> 00:19:13.770
he's in a classroom snap his fingers again, after that,

422
00:19:13.950 --> 00:19:15.660
like he's inside of a weed eater, right?

423
00:19:15.661 --> 00:19:18.900
Like he's just inside of like a Bush Hawk snapping his fingers again and again

424
00:19:18.901 --> 00:19:19.680
and again and again,

425
00:19:19.680 --> 00:19:23.010
and everything around Brian Braddock is just twisting and changing and skewing,

426
00:19:23.040 --> 00:19:23.940
but it's nuts.

427
00:19:24.060 --> 00:19:28.050
And all this means is that Brian Brodick is painfully out of his league.

428
00:19:28.140 --> 00:19:30.420
He has no answer for Jim Jaspers.

429
00:19:30.570 --> 00:19:33.780
And the funny thing about this is that the way in which Jim Jaspers is defeated,

430
00:19:33.820 --> 00:19:37.160
doesn't even come from, from, uh, from Brian Bradick himself instead,

431
00:19:37.200 --> 00:19:40.980
seemingly out of nowhere with him finally tracking down Brian Bradick,

432
00:19:41.010 --> 00:19:44.970
the fury goes on the attack and he immediately starts going after Brian

433
00:19:45.300 --> 00:19:46.140
Braddock, right. Starts pummeling him.

434
00:19:46.141 --> 00:19:48.900
He ends up breaking his arm by just beating the absolute hell out of the sky.

435
00:19:48.960 --> 00:19:52.740
And so what is happening here is a Jim Jasper basically creates the crazy gang

436
00:19:52.741 --> 00:19:54.900
out of nowhere. Right. Just kind of creates them out of dirt. And it's like,

437
00:19:54.930 --> 00:19:58.560
I created everything in existence and I need you guys to defeat Brian it,

438
00:19:58.590 --> 00:20:01.470
but then like, as soon as the fury shows up, he's like, I never created that.

439
00:20:01.670 --> 00:20:04.920
That's weird. And so we started looking at the fury starts kind of examining it.

440
00:20:05.010 --> 00:20:06.810
Right. It's just kind of like, you're a little strange, like, I mean,

441
00:20:06.811 --> 00:20:09.240
I feel like I've met you before, but this is a little weird,

442
00:20:09.270 --> 00:20:12.930
but the theory is looking at Jim Jaspers and the fury is like, okay,

443
00:20:12.990 --> 00:20:15.960
I was programmed to not kill Jim Jaspers.

444
00:20:16.020 --> 00:20:18.300
But that program came from an alternate reality.

445
00:20:18.360 --> 00:20:22.590
That was the alternate reality version of Jim Jasper's. This is not that guy.

446
00:20:22.650 --> 00:20:25.260
So my programming should allow me to kill him.

447
00:20:25.410 --> 00:20:29.700
And so basically the fury goes after Jim Jaspers and what you get here is the

448
00:20:30.030 --> 00:20:33.210
Fury's ability to adapt versus Jim Jasper's ability to control reality.

449
00:20:33.240 --> 00:20:36.510
An unstoppable force meets an immovable object is what this is.

450
00:20:36.540 --> 00:20:39.720
And so every time Jim Jaspers launches an attack, the fury adapts,

451
00:20:39.721 --> 00:20:42.090
right it's attack, adapt attack, adapt attack,

452
00:20:42.120 --> 00:20:44.940
adapt it's over and over and over again by just constantly.

453
00:20:44.970 --> 00:20:48.280
And the more that Jim Jaspers attacks, the more the fury adapts.

454
00:20:48.310 --> 00:20:51.790
So the power starts to become more and more extreme to the point where they

455
00:20:51.791 --> 00:20:53.740
rewrite reality and they're fighting on the moon.

456
00:20:53.770 --> 00:20:56.560
Then they changed reality and they're fighting on the sun that change reality

457
00:20:56.561 --> 00:21:00.430
they're fighting in help you reality is shifting in such a way that with Merlin

458
00:21:00.431 --> 00:21:04.480
watching all this unfold and actually overwhelms his mind and kills him. Now,

459
00:21:04.481 --> 00:21:06.850
the funny thing about this is that Merlin actually fakes his death.

460
00:21:06.880 --> 00:21:08.890
He's not actually debt. Oh, that was a way for,

461
00:21:08.891 --> 00:21:11.740
for them to kind of make them appear dead and then have him create Excalibur and

462
00:21:11.741 --> 00:21:13.690
Marvel comics. That's really kind of where that comes from,

463
00:21:13.720 --> 00:21:16.720
but they keep rewriting reality and changing things, right.

464
00:21:16.721 --> 00:21:18.520
And everything keeps getting screwed up around them,

465
00:21:18.521 --> 00:21:21.160
keeps getting skewed to the point that they're actually turning into creatures

466
00:21:21.161 --> 00:21:23.470
that don't even really exist. But it's basically this,

467
00:21:23.471 --> 00:21:26.710
these two guys facing off against each other and the fury comes to this

468
00:21:26.711 --> 00:21:28.990
realization. This fight would be limitless,

469
00:21:29.020 --> 00:21:31.000
but this fight would go on forever and ever.

470
00:21:31.030 --> 00:21:34.330
And they would actually end up destroying all of reality and the process, right?

471
00:21:34.360 --> 00:21:36.250
Because the powers would just get so extreme,

472
00:21:36.280 --> 00:21:39.550
more and more altering of reality would take place as the fury kind of starts

473
00:21:39.580 --> 00:21:41.530
calculating, like while this fight is going on,

474
00:21:41.710 --> 00:21:43.090
the fury starts calculating and says,

475
00:21:43.120 --> 00:21:45.220
there's only actually one way to end this fight.

476
00:21:45.220 --> 00:21:48.760
So we switches and he teleports Jim Jaspers to earth two 38,

477
00:21:48.790 --> 00:21:53.020
where there is no universe because the fury figured out that Jim Jasper's powers

478
00:21:53.021 --> 00:21:55.360
require him to have a universe to alter.

479
00:21:55.390 --> 00:21:59.290
And that right there is the difference between adult Franklin Richards and Jim

480
00:21:59.860 --> 00:22:01.710
Jasper's that Jim Jaspers has to have,

481
00:22:01.780 --> 00:22:04.240
has to have a universe to create anything in, right.

482
00:22:04.390 --> 00:22:06.070
That he's not really creating something out of nothing.

483
00:22:06.100 --> 00:22:08.710
He's just altering the existing fabric of the universe.

484
00:22:08.740 --> 00:22:12.100
He has to have a reality in order to alter Franklin Richards.

485
00:22:12.160 --> 00:22:14.530
We saw in Jonathan, Hickman's a fantastic fork.

486
00:22:14.560 --> 00:22:15.820
He can create something out of nothing,

487
00:22:15.910 --> 00:22:17.980
or he can just create a universe out of nothing.

488
00:22:18.010 --> 00:22:19.450
So like we've seen him do that before.

489
00:22:19.480 --> 00:22:21.700
So that's the huge difference between these two guys,

490
00:22:21.730 --> 00:22:24.580
but with Jim Jasper as being in a place where there is no universe,

491
00:22:24.610 --> 00:22:27.100
then basically he's powerless. He's just an average guy.

492
00:22:27.130 --> 00:22:29.380
The fury puts his hands to his head fries, his brain.

493
00:22:29.410 --> 00:22:33.370
And that's the end of Jim Jasper's following that the fury ends up traveling

494
00:22:33.371 --> 00:22:37.150
back to the main Marvel universe with the intention of going after captain

495
00:22:37.151 --> 00:22:40.420
Britain. The problem with this is that all that effect of reality,

496
00:22:40.421 --> 00:22:44.110
warping and adapting to the various forms that Jim Jasper's was taking on,

497
00:22:44.290 --> 00:22:48.730
took a huge toll on the fury and pushed him to the extreme so much so that he is

498
00:22:48.731 --> 00:22:51.010
exceedingly weakened. And so because of that,

499
00:22:51.011 --> 00:22:55.720
it offers Brian Brodick alongside Linda, the one chance they need to destroy it.

500
00:22:55.780 --> 00:22:56.980
And that's exactly what they do,

501
00:22:57.220 --> 00:23:00.280
but they use their powers and completely annihilate the fury really,

502
00:23:00.310 --> 00:23:03.340
really more Linda. They basically saved by biotic than anything else,

503
00:23:03.370 --> 00:23:06.730
but they completely and totally obliterate the fury. And that ends that right?

504
00:23:06.731 --> 00:23:09.130
The Fury's destroyed. Jim Jasper's is destroyed,

505
00:23:09.220 --> 00:23:13.030
but the caveat to this is it Saturday and realizing the power that you could

506
00:23:13.031 --> 00:23:17.080
potentially possess here actually ends up extracting a DNA sample of Jim

507
00:23:17.650 --> 00:23:18.850
Jasper's. Now this is important.

508
00:23:18.851 --> 00:23:20.410
The reason why I really want to include this in here.

509
00:23:20.411 --> 00:23:23.260
And the reason why it's important is because I would surmise the next time that

510
00:23:23.261 --> 00:23:24.940
we see Jim, Jasper's basically in Marvel.

511
00:23:24.970 --> 00:23:28.210
The next time we see him is an X-Men die by the sword, I believe.

512
00:23:28.240 --> 00:23:31.450
And it is in the aftermath of house of M and that you end up seeing him

513
00:23:31.451 --> 00:23:34.480
re-emerge buddies and he's merged with a fury, right? That's not real.

514
00:23:34.481 --> 00:23:36.490
That doesn't really seem to be anything that, uh,

515
00:23:36.520 --> 00:23:39.580
that Hickman is following in his, uh, excess swords event.

516
00:23:39.640 --> 00:23:40.960
And so what this looks like,

517
00:23:41.020 --> 00:23:45.350
is it Saturday made good that she actually ended up cloning Jim Jaspers and he's

518
00:23:45.351 --> 00:23:48.410
the one that runs a crooked market, right? He's a recreation of Saturday.

519
00:23:48.440 --> 00:23:51.500
Now she may have altered his mind altered his memories. We don't really know,

520
00:23:51.560 --> 00:23:55.010
but regardless of the situation, what this does is it leads to a funeral,

521
00:23:55.040 --> 00:23:57.710
kind of a funeral for Merlin, even though he's not actually dead. Right.

522
00:23:57.770 --> 00:23:59.330
And basically the day has been saved right.

523
00:23:59.331 --> 00:24:02.360
Saturday and just kind of has an ASAP for sleep, which he uses our man dragon,

524
00:24:02.390 --> 00:24:04.160
right? She ends up going to visit man dragon. And she's like,

525
00:24:04.161 --> 00:24:05.240
you're going to give me a full pardon.

526
00:24:05.300 --> 00:24:08.630
Otherwise I'm going to take this clone body of Jim Jasper's that we're treating

527
00:24:08.631 --> 00:24:09.110
right now.

528
00:24:09.110 --> 00:24:12.260
And I'm going to unleash it on your world and let him just lose his mind and go

529
00:24:12.261 --> 00:24:14.210
crazy. So of course she gets a full pardon.

530
00:24:14.240 --> 00:24:16.280
She's returned back to being in the position of magistrates.

531
00:24:16.310 --> 00:24:17.430
That's kind of how she maintained,

532
00:24:17.680 --> 00:24:20.540
maintain her possession ever since the days basically saved. Right. You know,

533
00:24:20.541 --> 00:24:22.190
that's kind of how the story ends, but you know,

534
00:24:22.191 --> 00:24:25.280
I wanted to throw this out there and I wanted to, to bring this to you guys,

535
00:24:25.310 --> 00:24:29.450
because I thought it was important to understand the power Jasper's has and why

536
00:24:29.451 --> 00:24:33.770
him being in X's sword is potentially a massive credible threat, right?

537
00:24:33.771 --> 00:24:37.400
Because this guy has a ridiculous level of power. So with that being said, guys,

538
00:24:37.430 --> 00:24:38.510
we're going to bring this video to an end.

539
00:24:38.570 --> 00:24:40.150
