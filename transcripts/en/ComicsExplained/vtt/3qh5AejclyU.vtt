4
00:00:11.280 --> 00:00:12.480
Okay. What's going.

5
00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:14.820
<v 1>On guys? This is Rob and we are covering.</v>

6
00:00:14.820 --> 00:00:17.400
<v 0>King and black part two. Yes.</v>

7
00:00:17.870 --> 00:00:21.140
<v 1>Oh, we're we're in kingdom, black. The officials second issue of King of like,</v>

8
00:00:21.170 --> 00:00:23.420
I guess it's not really part two. Cause we, we had what,

9
00:00:23.421 --> 00:00:25.640
like the venom tie in that we had the incredible whole tie-in.

10
00:00:25.700 --> 00:00:27.590
I still need to do iron man and Dr. Doom,

11
00:00:27.770 --> 00:00:29.630
because I feel like that one's insanely good up,

12
00:00:29.660 --> 00:00:32.930
but we're covering part two of King and black, right. Issue number two.

13
00:00:33.110 --> 00:00:34.910
And this basically picks up with Eddie Brock,

14
00:00:34.911 --> 00:00:37.940
like falling presumably to his death or at least it looked like his death.

15
00:00:37.941 --> 00:00:40.700
Right. We had that amazing issue in venom where the whole thing took,

16
00:00:40.760 --> 00:00:42.560
took place over the span of something like,

17
00:00:42.620 --> 00:00:45.620
what is it like 33 seconds or something like that. It's like this just,

18
00:00:45.621 --> 00:00:47.030
it was amazing the way that it was done.

19
00:00:47.090 --> 00:00:49.970
So any broad crash lands down into the ground, right? Like,

20
00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:52.700
like literally hitting all these different things along the way he crashed,

21
00:00:52.701 --> 00:00:55.820
landed down to the ground. Spiderman comes swinging into the rescue right now.

22
00:00:55.850 --> 00:00:59.750
Here's the thing Spider-Man is like one of the last hero standing here in New

23
00:00:59.750 --> 00:01:01.850
York, right? There's there's a few others more find out who they are,

24
00:01:01.940 --> 00:01:04.370
but for the most part, most heroes are basically gone.

25
00:01:04.430 --> 00:01:06.470
And the initial thought of Spiderman is like,

26
00:01:06.680 --> 00:01:09.890
he like Eddie Brock is dead and he tried to race back here and get to Eddie as

27
00:01:09.891 --> 00:01:11.690
fast as he could. But he couldn't right now.

28
00:01:11.720 --> 00:01:13.250
Here's the important thing to understand about this.

29
00:01:13.340 --> 00:01:14.630
This is one of the coolest things, right?

30
00:01:14.631 --> 00:01:17.690
And it's not heavily mentioned here and it's only released something you pick up

31
00:01:17.691 --> 00:01:19.880
on if you've been reading for a reasonable amount of time,

32
00:01:19.970 --> 00:01:22.850
but this whole scene is beautiful and amazing, right?

33
00:01:22.851 --> 00:01:26.300
Because these guys have been enemies over the years, right?

34
00:01:26.330 --> 00:01:29.630
They've been pretty extreme enemies over the years. Eddie Brock first showed up,

35
00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:31.850
not really for shut up, but when he first became venom,

36
00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:34.340
he was like Peter Parker sworn enemy. He's like,

37
00:01:34.341 --> 00:01:36.680
I'm gonna do everything I can to kill you and destroy your life.

38
00:01:36.681 --> 00:01:40.040
And he went after Peter Parker's family, the whole nine yards, right.

39
00:01:40.041 --> 00:01:42.020
He would just asymmetrical war on Peter.

40
00:01:42.050 --> 00:01:45.230
And now you have a scenario where Eddie Brock looks like he's about to die.

41
00:01:45.260 --> 00:01:48.680
And Peter feels totally ashamed of himself that he couldn't make it here in

42
00:01:48.681 --> 00:01:50.810
time. Right. Screaming for help calling for help.

43
00:01:50.811 --> 00:01:54.740
Now Eddie Brock wakes up and then basically tells Peter like Dylan. Right?

44
00:01:54.770 --> 00:01:58.010
Promise me that you'll look after Dylan now for no himself.

45
00:01:58.040 --> 00:02:01.190
He kind of makes us this sort of, sort of funny remark. And it's like, honestly,

46
00:02:01.191 --> 00:02:04.490
how hard is it to kill one, man? Well, not hard if you do it properly. No,

47
00:02:04.491 --> 00:02:07.580
because all you had to do was like terrorist head off or rip his heart out of

48
00:02:07.581 --> 00:02:12.020
his body or rip them in half or Tara's arms and legs off or any number of the

49
00:02:12.021 --> 00:02:15.320
things that you could have done besides just dropping him to his death.

50
00:02:15.380 --> 00:02:18.440
Here's the funny thing about this, like obviously is it's like,

51
00:02:18.470 --> 00:02:19.700
this is for the sake of the story,

52
00:02:19.760 --> 00:02:22.460
but it's one of these funny things where like you have villains and kind of

53
00:02:22.461 --> 00:02:24.860
books who get frustrated over the fact that they can't kill us,

54
00:02:24.920 --> 00:02:29.060
kill a character all the while glossing over any one of the infinite number of

55
00:02:29.090 --> 00:02:30.590
easy ways to do it, right?

56
00:02:30.591 --> 00:02:33.230
Like any one of the infinite number of easy ways to kill these guys.

57
00:02:33.231 --> 00:02:35.360
And so it's kind of a funny little thing to me,

58
00:02:35.480 --> 00:02:39.110
but ultimately like the spider sense of Peter Parker kicks in when he suddenly

59
00:02:39.111 --> 00:02:40.940
met by an optic glass from Cyclops.

60
00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:44.630
And that's when he realizes all these heroes that were fighting here in New

61
00:02:44.630 --> 00:02:48.200
York, they were not killed by Knoll. They were conscripted into NOLs army.

62
00:02:48.201 --> 00:02:52.040
Now we largely assumed this is what was exactly what was going to happen because

63
00:02:52.041 --> 00:02:53.330
we saw Ben and beyond, right?

64
00:02:53.330 --> 00:02:56.930
And we saw this alternate reality where Dylan basically became a person who

65
00:02:56.931 --> 00:03:01.120
conquered earth and essentially turned all superheroes to aside by forcing

66
00:03:01.570 --> 00:03:02.110
symbionts on them.

67
00:03:02.110 --> 00:03:05.050
And in some cases that they were already dead turning the symbionts into those

68
00:03:05.051 --> 00:03:08.470
guys. But the long and short of this is that we kind of saw this coming. Right.

69
00:03:08.471 --> 00:03:12.040
And so Peter Parker basically tries to get out of there as fast as he can.

70
00:03:12.070 --> 00:03:15.340
But for the most part, he kind of seems truck when, out of nowhere,

71
00:03:15.341 --> 00:03:19.000
right out of, out of nowhere comes Johnny storm right now.

72
00:03:19.001 --> 00:03:22.000
Here's the funny thing my initial thought to this, my in my initial thought was,

73
00:03:22.060 --> 00:03:23.260
Oh my God, that's right.

74
00:03:23.261 --> 00:03:26.830
Johnny storm has a built-in immunity to symbionts because he can flame on,

75
00:03:26.831 --> 00:03:29.770
right? Like that's, that was my, my immediate thought. And I was like, Oh no,

76
00:03:29.800 --> 00:03:32.710
wait a minute. These Grendel's are not like venom. Right.

77
00:03:32.740 --> 00:03:33.850
They're stronger than that.

78
00:03:33.851 --> 00:03:36.730
You can't just torch them with fire and call it a day. Otherwise,

79
00:03:36.760 --> 00:03:39.910
all you would do is have the superheroes running around with aerosol cans and

80
00:03:39.911 --> 00:03:42.670
lighters. Right. Just spraying down everything in front of them.

81
00:03:42.790 --> 00:03:45.340
And that would be it, right. This story will be over like that. It'd be,

82
00:03:45.341 --> 00:03:48.130
it'd be over lickety split, but it's still cool here because,

83
00:03:48.610 --> 00:03:51.160
because Johnny storm could easily become just written in here.

84
00:03:51.190 --> 00:03:52.210
It's like the saving grace.

85
00:03:52.270 --> 00:03:54.820
And he has had those moments while you guys remember in Jonathan,

86
00:03:55.120 --> 00:03:57.550
Hickman's fantastic for what? Like the portal opens up like,

87
00:03:57.600 --> 00:04:01.540
like literally the portal to the, to the negative zone opens up and like,

88
00:04:01.541 --> 00:04:03.970
it opens up inside the fantastic four Baxter building and like,

89
00:04:03.990 --> 00:04:06.510
like everybody's panicking. They're freaking out. Like Johnny goes in there,

90
00:04:06.700 --> 00:04:08.890
he's like close the portal behind me. Right. So they shut the portal behind him.

91
00:04:08.950 --> 00:04:11.500
He turns around phases like this hoard of like,

92
00:04:11.530 --> 00:04:15.580
like a billion members of the annihilation wave. And it's just like flame on.

93
00:04:15.581 --> 00:04:18.310
Right. And then, and then like, it cuts like it, it just ends. And it's like,

94
00:04:18.400 --> 00:04:21.480
you're just like the greatest cliffhanger ever in the history of comics plays

95
00:04:21.490 --> 00:04:23.230
amazing moment. But, but nonetheless,

96
00:04:23.260 --> 00:04:26.290
Johnny storm has had those moments and where he realizes that, yeah,

97
00:04:26.291 --> 00:04:29.770
he can't really just blast the symbionts with his fire and kind of bring them to

98
00:04:29.771 --> 00:04:32.020
an end. He goes so far as to say, then fine,

99
00:04:32.170 --> 00:04:36.130
I'll let off my Nova blast when that happened, Peter, Parker's like, let's go.

100
00:04:36.160 --> 00:04:38.650
Right. Because when the Nova blast goes off from Johnny storm,

101
00:04:38.680 --> 00:04:42.190
if you're in the vicinity, you are dead. And there's no arguing that point.

102
00:04:42.191 --> 00:04:45.580
It's literally the sun exploding is what it is right here. Like he reaches,

103
00:04:45.581 --> 00:04:49.780
I think at, or near the temperature of the sun when he does his Nova blocks.

104
00:04:49.780 --> 00:04:53.380
Right. Just lets everything off. Now the downside of this is when that happens.

105
00:04:53.381 --> 00:04:56.050
It's basically expanding all of his energy at one time.

106
00:04:56.170 --> 00:04:58.780
Of course he passes out and that's something that Peter Parker says, like,

107
00:04:58.781 --> 00:05:01.120
if you do this, you're going to pass out and they're going to take you.

108
00:05:01.150 --> 00:05:03.460
He's like, yeah, I know, but it can buy you time. Right.

109
00:05:03.461 --> 00:05:06.370
It can buy you time to get out of here. And so that's exactly what Peter does.

110
00:05:06.371 --> 00:05:08.410
Right? He webs up Eddie Brock. He gets him out of there.

111
00:05:08.470 --> 00:05:10.090
And then he takes them over to the Homebase,

112
00:05:10.091 --> 00:05:12.730
the laboratory of the fantastic four and the Baxter building.

113
00:05:12.731 --> 00:05:16.870
Now here's the thing we basically ended up picking up here with Valkyrie. Now,

114
00:05:16.871 --> 00:05:18.820
for those of you guys who don't know what's going on with the character of

115
00:05:18.821 --> 00:05:21.130
Valkyrie, Jane Foster now plays that role.

116
00:05:21.190 --> 00:05:25.720
And what Marvel did here in the aftermath of Jason Aaron's run on, on Thor. Oh,

117
00:05:25.780 --> 00:05:29.500
I love Jane Foster Thor. I don't really care if you didn't like it. I loved it.

118
00:05:29.530 --> 00:05:31.300
Right. And your opinion's not going to change mine,

119
00:05:31.420 --> 00:05:33.010
but I love the whole story there.

120
00:05:33.011 --> 00:05:36.370
But what they ended up doing is because Odin's son was going to go back to being

121
00:05:36.730 --> 00:05:37.870
Thor, just like I always said,

122
00:05:37.871 --> 00:05:41.260
he would be because it's comics and everything old goes back to the way

123
00:05:41.261 --> 00:05:42.760
everything goes back to the way that it used to be. Right?

124
00:05:42.761 --> 00:05:46.710
The status quo is always maintain that this led to Marvel kind of shuffling Jane

125
00:05:46.710 --> 00:05:49.060
Foster out, right? She got shuffled off to the cornfields and her own,

126
00:05:49.120 --> 00:05:52.000
his own comic. That was never really advertised all that well. And, uh,

127
00:05:52.060 --> 00:05:54.550
as she's basically been Valkyrie ever since, what does she do?

128
00:05:54.580 --> 00:05:57.590
She basically shepherds those from the land of the living to the, of the dead.

129
00:05:57.650 --> 00:06:01.490
And the reason why this matters is because she has this kind of power or ability

130
00:06:01.491 --> 00:06:05.480
more or less to know how close somebody is to death and where Peter Parker asks,

131
00:06:05.510 --> 00:06:08.090
how close is Eddie Brock to dine? She's like, well, you know,

132
00:06:08.330 --> 00:06:11.000
I can tell you enough to say you better hurry up, right?

133
00:06:11.001 --> 00:06:14.150
Because he's basically almost done with all his living. So it was like, okay,

134
00:06:14.210 --> 00:06:17.390
so you basically end up having Peter Parker who goes, and he grabs Dylan. Now,

135
00:06:17.450 --> 00:06:20.000
as soon as he gets into this room where Dylan's being hidden,

136
00:06:20.060 --> 00:06:23.930
as soon as Dylan sees Spiderman, he's like, okay, bye. Basically like he asks,

137
00:06:23.990 --> 00:06:27.530
the question is my dad dead, you know, is, is my dad basically dead and gone?

138
00:06:27.531 --> 00:06:30.620
And Peter's response is no, like not what I left him, but you know,

139
00:06:30.650 --> 00:06:33.050
we need to get you and we need to get outta here. Now, something to understand,

140
00:06:33.051 --> 00:06:34.310
this is kind of an interesting thing here.

141
00:06:34.370 --> 00:06:36.440
Peter can't really look Dylan in the eye.

142
00:06:36.470 --> 00:06:39.020
And this is a small thing to notice is a very, very small thing,

143
00:06:39.050 --> 00:06:41.420
easy to overlook. But this is shame, right?

144
00:06:41.570 --> 00:06:43.070
A person who can't look you in the eye,

145
00:06:43.100 --> 00:06:46.280
whenever they've done something wrong is a person who shamed or feeling guilt

146
00:06:46.281 --> 00:06:47.450
for what it is that they did wrong.

147
00:06:47.570 --> 00:06:51.380
Peter believes he did something wrong by not being able to save the life of

148
00:06:51.590 --> 00:06:52.310
Eddie Brock. Again,

149
00:06:52.310 --> 00:06:55.370
tying into this history between the two and how significant it is.

150
00:06:55.400 --> 00:06:57.560
But once we end up having Peter grab, grab Dylan,

151
00:06:57.561 --> 00:07:00.410
and then head back to the fantastic four's, uh, base of operations,

152
00:07:00.440 --> 00:07:02.780
there's a handful of heroes here, right? We've got Reed Richards.

153
00:07:02.781 --> 00:07:05.570
We've got Susan storm. We don't really know where Franklin and Valeria are.

154
00:07:05.571 --> 00:07:08.630
Presumably they're being kept somewhere safe. You've got black Panther here.

155
00:07:08.660 --> 00:07:10.340
You've got blade, right? You've got, um,

156
00:07:10.490 --> 00:07:13.520
you've got Charles Xavier and Magneto who were showing up in the form of

157
00:07:13.521 --> 00:07:16.970
holograms. And you literally have blade asking them like open your Gates, right?

158
00:07:16.970 --> 00:07:20.120
So we can basically go there and you have no idea how many people you can say.

159
00:07:20.210 --> 00:07:24.560
The smart thing here for [inaudible] to do is to actually keep their Gates

160
00:07:24.590 --> 00:07:26.570
closed. And the reason why I know on the servers,

161
00:07:26.571 --> 00:07:29.240
it seems kind of Callison kind of cruel. But in times like this,

162
00:07:29.270 --> 00:07:32.180
you can't let the wrong people in. And when I say the wrong people,

163
00:07:32.210 --> 00:07:35.990
all it's going to take is for one Simbi that nobody knows about to be bonded to

164
00:07:35.991 --> 00:07:37.870
a person. And they're not even aware of it, right.

165
00:07:38.000 --> 00:07:40.130
It's just stowed away on a backpack or something like that.

166
00:07:40.190 --> 00:07:43.400
And then suddenly the entirety of cocoa's basically being taken over by

167
00:07:43.850 --> 00:07:45.500
symbions. Right? No one knows exactly how to get there.

168
00:07:45.560 --> 00:07:48.680
He goes in just bust into the place and they're all taken over. Right?

169
00:07:48.681 --> 00:07:52.910
So the smartest thing to do in any situation like this is to shut your doors and

170
00:07:52.911 --> 00:07:54.620
to say, no, you can't get in, right.

171
00:07:54.740 --> 00:07:57.350
We're I'm sorry about your luck is such as things are going South,

172
00:07:57.380 --> 00:08:01.130
but we can't take the risk of losing our people because of what's going on out

173
00:08:01.131 --> 00:08:02.570
there. Ah, sorry about your luck.

174
00:08:02.720 --> 00:08:04.340
Hopefully you find a better way to take care of it.

175
00:08:04.341 --> 00:08:07.510
Now the X-Men don't necessarily leave the other superheroes hanging,

176
00:08:07.530 --> 00:08:09.170
feel like we can formulate a plan together,

177
00:08:09.200 --> 00:08:11.810
but we're not going to open our doors and let you in because we're going to let

178
00:08:11.811 --> 00:08:14.360
the wrong person in and everything is going to come to an end.

179
00:08:14.450 --> 00:08:18.410
The other part of this is that black Panther starts asking questions, says,

180
00:08:18.411 --> 00:08:20.750
okay, with everything going on here, like, yes,

181
00:08:21.290 --> 00:08:22.430
Wakanda's obviously going to fight,

182
00:08:22.460 --> 00:08:26.660
but what do we have in terms of like huge weapons of power, right?

183
00:08:26.690 --> 00:08:30.020
Do we have the infinity stones, the cosmic cube, the ultimate notifier?

184
00:08:30.080 --> 00:08:32.630
What do we have on hand that can bring an end to note,

185
00:08:32.840 --> 00:08:33.980
another responsive blade is,

186
00:08:34.130 --> 00:08:37.820
do we really need that kind of firepower and Valerie cottage Himes Dan.

187
00:08:37.820 --> 00:08:39.860
And it's like, you know what blade, here's the deal, man.

188
00:08:39.950 --> 00:08:43.640
We're talking about a guy who existed before existence existed. Right?

189
00:08:43.730 --> 00:08:45.950
And then like he killed, he killed some Celestials.

190
00:08:45.980 --> 00:08:47.330
He was locked away for a little while.

191
00:08:47.360 --> 00:08:50.060
Now he's back and he's taken over the celestial.

192
00:08:50.061 --> 00:08:53.930
So he's powerful enough to conquer Celestials he's here on our world and we're

193
00:08:53.931 --> 00:08:57.270
losing by not even a little bit. So yeah.

194
00:08:57.330 --> 00:09:01.170
I kind of think the idea of talking about the infinity gauntlet or the cosmic

195
00:09:01.171 --> 00:09:05.010
cube or the ultimate notifier is kind of a good idea because at this point,

196
00:09:05.100 --> 00:09:06.870
what, what else do we have left?

197
00:09:06.930 --> 00:09:10.410
It's literally been less than 30 minutes and we've all pretty much been

198
00:09:10.411 --> 00:09:13.230
conquered right? In the span of 30 minutes.

199
00:09:13.350 --> 00:09:16.470
Pretty much all the superheroes on earth have been totally taken over. Now,

200
00:09:16.620 --> 00:09:19.500
this is when we get the introduction of name or the submariner.

201
00:09:19.700 --> 00:09:22.410
And this is a cool thing here because Susan storm is the one that called them in

202
00:09:22.411 --> 00:09:24.480
now, Reed kind of pulls her aside and says, Hey cam,

203
00:09:24.490 --> 00:09:25.950
can we kind of talk privately for a second?

204
00:09:26.010 --> 00:09:29.160
And the reason why is because Nemours and Susan's dorm kind of have a history

205
00:09:29.190 --> 00:09:32.070
where they pretty much just bumped uglies a few times, right?

206
00:09:32.071 --> 00:09:33.750
Like she kinda cheated on read a few times,

207
00:09:33.751 --> 00:09:35.730
at least Marvel heavily alluded to it.

208
00:09:35.760 --> 00:09:38.730
There were a couple of times when Marvel was like, no, she never actually did.

209
00:09:38.790 --> 00:09:40.980
But if you go back and you read the original source material,

210
00:09:41.100 --> 00:09:42.540
she pretty much dead. Right? I mean,

211
00:09:42.541 --> 00:09:45.810
that's basically what happened at the very least.

212
00:09:45.811 --> 00:09:48.930
There was the idea of her leaving read for namer, but, but name, workshop,

213
00:09:49.080 --> 00:09:51.540
you know, showing up here is kind of like, look like here's the thing.

214
00:09:51.570 --> 00:09:55.860
My entire race has been fighting in the shadows for millennia, right?

215
00:09:55.860 --> 00:09:58.800
Like we've been fighting all these crazy enemies that are out there.

216
00:09:58.830 --> 00:10:01.590
You're losing this war and you're losing it by a lot. Right.

217
00:10:01.591 --> 00:10:05.310
So if you want to succeed, you're going to need my help right now.

218
00:10:05.340 --> 00:10:07.560
My people are here and my guys are here.

219
00:10:07.740 --> 00:10:12.600
Does anybody here have anything that even remotely resembles a plan

220
00:10:12.660 --> 00:10:16.800
and Tony stark chimes in and says I do, but it's going to be crazy. Right?

221
00:10:16.801 --> 00:10:19.800
It's going to be a crazy, ridiculous plan. So he's got, he's like,

222
00:10:19.801 --> 00:10:22.890
I've got this plan and I've got a few others that I'm trying to work on here.

223
00:10:22.980 --> 00:10:26.970
But what we need to understand here is that Eddie Brock is the only one that's

224
00:10:26.971 --> 00:10:30.210
going to be able to save us. And I need to get one of the dragons from no,

225
00:10:30.240 --> 00:10:33.210
right now here's the thing. If you're a superhero in this room and you're like,

226
00:10:33.211 --> 00:10:35.460
does anybody here have a plan, an iron man's like, yeah, man,

227
00:10:35.490 --> 00:10:38.160
but I'm going to need a dragon. It's kind of like, okay, cool.

228
00:10:38.161 --> 00:10:39.600
Let's go see if we could find a dragon. They're like.

229
00:10:41.280 --> 00:10:42.420
<v 2>You don't really question the.</v>

230
00:10:42.420 --> 00:10:44.940
<v 1>Plans of iron man. Right? Tony, soccer's a futurist.</v>

231
00:10:44.970 --> 00:10:47.670
He's always thinking in the future. And depending on the circumstance,

232
00:10:47.790 --> 00:10:50.430
he's actually smarter than anybody else in this room. Again,

233
00:10:50.460 --> 00:10:52.650
it depends on what situation that we're talking about here.

234
00:10:52.860 --> 00:10:54.480
But because he thinks about things in a,

235
00:10:54.481 --> 00:10:58.050
in a far more interesting way and in a far more new, a far more nuanced way,

236
00:10:58.110 --> 00:11:00.660
thinking more about the future, then thinking about today,

237
00:11:00.720 --> 00:11:02.490
it really puts them kind of ahead of everybody else.

238
00:11:02.550 --> 00:11:05.310
And so one of the things that happens is we have this group called the black

239
00:11:05.311 --> 00:11:08.880
tide, which are basically like, what is it? The things from a Aquaman.

240
00:11:08.940 --> 00:11:12.900
I don't remember exactly what they're called like in before DC fans are like SU

241
00:11:13.440 --> 00:11:16.140
Marvel steals from Duc. And before those guys, because you know,

242
00:11:16.141 --> 00:11:20.250
they're going to post in the comment section. But, um, but yeah,

243
00:11:20.280 --> 00:11:23.280
like it's basically these enemies that are out there that Ironman knew about

244
00:11:23.310 --> 00:11:26.760
that, uh, that, that, that name of the sub Mariner didn't think he did,

245
00:11:26.820 --> 00:11:29.310
but these guys are cowered by like dark magic.

246
00:11:29.340 --> 00:11:33.270
But the idea is to rally them to their cause at the same time you have blade who

247
00:11:33.750 --> 00:11:37.650
traveled travels to Chernobyl in Ukraine and then basically tells like, Dracula,

248
00:11:37.830 --> 00:11:40.770
we need your help. You switched to the bar with no name in New York.

249
00:11:40.830 --> 00:11:43.320
And you have the, have the mayor of New York, Wilson Fisk,

250
00:11:43.321 --> 00:11:45.450
the kingpin who comes walking in and it's like,

251
00:11:45.480 --> 00:11:48.870
does anybody want to make some money? Right. It's all hands on deck.

252
00:11:48.900 --> 00:11:51.510
It's basically like, there's no more villains. And in this,

253
00:11:51.540 --> 00:11:54.430
in this whole study where there's no heroes, no is just survivors.

254
00:11:54.550 --> 00:11:55.510
That's all this is.

255
00:11:55.570 --> 00:11:58.690
And we're gonna all going to have to like put these problems aside and work in

256
00:11:58.691 --> 00:12:01.390
unison. If we're going to pull this off now for iron man's part,

257
00:12:01.450 --> 00:12:05.140
he ends up taking off and literally flying into New York and then traveling to

258
00:12:05.141 --> 00:12:06.250
one of the dragons right now,

259
00:12:06.251 --> 00:12:09.550
the reason why the dragon is being used is because these beings seem to have the

260
00:12:09.551 --> 00:12:13.120
closest connection to know than any other of the other symbionts that are out

261
00:12:13.121 --> 00:12:16.300
there. Right? So it effectively makes them the strongest quote unquote.

262
00:12:16.510 --> 00:12:19.300
And so Ironman basically gets in there and says, okay, cool. You know,

263
00:12:19.301 --> 00:12:22.150
I'm going to have to essentially rewrite this guy's DNA, right?

264
00:12:22.151 --> 00:12:24.040
I'm going to have treat it like a computer program, right?

265
00:12:24.041 --> 00:12:26.440
If I have a computer program that's not working the way that I want it to,

266
00:12:26.500 --> 00:12:29.590
then I just rewrite the code and then get it to do what I want it to do.

267
00:12:29.650 --> 00:12:31.240
That's what he's talking about here. Right?

268
00:12:31.390 --> 00:12:35.730
Rewriting the DNA of this entire thing to make it subservient to the heroes and,

269
00:12:35.731 --> 00:12:39.130
and really took how to follow the direction of Ironman as opposed to following

270
00:12:39.131 --> 00:12:40.090
the directions of Nope.

271
00:12:40.150 --> 00:12:43.810
The problem with this is that while he uses extremis and he gets in there and

272
00:12:43.811 --> 00:12:47.110
starts, you know, kind of manipulating this guy's DNA starts tapping into it.

273
00:12:47.170 --> 00:12:50.710
What he starts to realize is that these are all connected through a hive mind.

274
00:12:50.740 --> 00:12:52.210
Now we already knew that, right? We,

275
00:12:52.211 --> 00:12:55.510
as the reader already knew that a hive mind is what connects all these things

276
00:12:55.511 --> 00:12:59.680
under. No, but they're all experiencing constant pain, right? Pain, anguish,

277
00:12:59.710 --> 00:13:01.750
suffering. It's just millions of voices,

278
00:13:01.810 --> 00:13:05.560
all screaming at the same time to the point that it actually starts to overwhelm

279
00:13:05.590 --> 00:13:07.660
Ironman. Now, ultimately it does not.

280
00:13:07.690 --> 00:13:10.990
And it basically leads to him traveling back to where Eddie Brock is and then

281
00:13:10.991 --> 00:13:14.080
taking the Symbian and then pouring it on the, any life, taking this Grindle,

282
00:13:14.110 --> 00:13:17.530
putting it on any Brock with the belief that once it bonds to Eddie,

283
00:13:17.650 --> 00:13:20.800
that Eddie can maintain himself. And if he's able to maintain himself,

284
00:13:20.830 --> 00:13:23.110
he can in turn, travel directly to know,

285
00:13:23.170 --> 00:13:26.350
and then essentially create a back door that allows the superheroes to get in

286
00:13:26.410 --> 00:13:27.910
and find some way to conquer. Now,

287
00:13:27.970 --> 00:13:31.330
the problem with this is that as soon as the Grendel's starts bonding to Eddie,

288
00:13:31.390 --> 00:13:33.850
things start popping off, right? His vitals are just spiking.

289
00:13:34.000 --> 00:13:35.770
It looks like he's going into cardiac arrest.

290
00:13:35.800 --> 00:13:38.080
It's it's too much for his body to handle and him.

291
00:13:38.230 --> 00:13:40.540
And it's one of these things where we don't know if it's because of the injuries

292
00:13:40.541 --> 00:13:43.990
he sustained or if it just simply is too much for him, right?

293
00:13:43.991 --> 00:13:46.930
The nature of the Grindle itself is something that Eddie Brock simply can't

294
00:13:46.931 --> 00:13:49.780
handle on his own. Now the whole time this is going on, right?

295
00:13:49.781 --> 00:13:50.830
The whole time this is happening,

296
00:13:50.920 --> 00:13:53.670
Dylan is trying to get the attention of the whole. He was right there.

297
00:13:53.671 --> 00:13:55.140
Like we got to find a way to pull it off. Right?

298
00:13:55.440 --> 00:13:56.730
We've got to find a way to get this thing off.

299
00:13:56.820 --> 00:13:59.460
We gotta find a way to pull it off. And Dylan's like, guides guys, hold on,

300
00:13:59.461 --> 00:14:01.770
everybody. I need you to move. And they're like, no, this isn't gonna,

301
00:14:01.771 --> 00:14:04.470
we're trying to get this off the whole time. They're ignoring Dylan. Right.

302
00:14:04.471 --> 00:14:08.670
And he's just like, hi. And he like screams. And he's like I said, move.

303
00:14:08.671 --> 00:14:13.050
And then like, blast the semi, like blast the Grendel off of Eddie Brock.

304
00:14:13.080 --> 00:14:15.840
Like literally disintegrates it in one touch.

305
00:14:15.960 --> 00:14:18.150
Now we knew that was the power of Dylan. Right?

306
00:14:18.151 --> 00:14:21.690
Don't have the ability to con to destroy or control. Symbionts right.

307
00:14:21.720 --> 00:14:24.630
We know we have that power. He's very similar to null in that way.

308
00:14:24.720 --> 00:14:27.120
None of the other superheroes knew. And because they're adults,

309
00:14:27.121 --> 00:14:29.640
of course they don't listen to kids because adults feel like they know more than

310
00:14:29.641 --> 00:14:31.470
kids. And in a lot of ways they do,

311
00:14:31.560 --> 00:14:35.250
the kids have something that most adults don't have, which is imagination.

312
00:14:35.460 --> 00:14:38.160
And so this basically leads to them realizing, Oh my God,

313
00:14:38.220 --> 00:14:40.050
this kid can be our secret weapon. Right.

314
00:14:40.051 --> 00:14:42.570
We're obviously not going to have him marching out in New York and start

315
00:14:42.571 --> 00:14:45.960
blasting Symbyax with his hand. No, what scoop him up in an instant. Right?

316
00:14:45.961 --> 00:14:48.930
But he is our secret weapon. If we can formulate a plan around him,

317
00:14:49.020 --> 00:14:50.850
then we can basically find a way to win the,

318
00:14:51.200 --> 00:14:53.480
with this is they start hearing this noise, right?

319
00:14:53.481 --> 00:14:57.110
There's just a kind of this explosion. You have this you'll kind of deep, deep,

320
00:14:57.140 --> 00:14:57.650
you know?

321
00:14:57.650 --> 00:15:02.030
And then it's just beep and that's when you realize Eddie Brock has flatlined.

322
00:15:02.090 --> 00:15:03.740
All the other superheros here,

323
00:15:03.920 --> 00:15:08.750
and Dylan realized that Eddie Brock has basically just died with that

324
00:15:08.751 --> 00:15:10.940
