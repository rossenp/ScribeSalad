4
00:00:11.100 --> 00:00:12.350
What's going on guys. This is.

5
00:00:12.800 --> 00:00:14.990
<v 1>Robin for today's episode of beyond Omega level.</v>

6
00:00:15.020 --> 00:00:19.760
We're going way beyond Omega level and discussing one of the cosmic abstracts of

7
00:00:19.761 --> 00:00:22.080
Marvel comics eternity. So we turned it,

8
00:00:22.130 --> 00:00:25.550
he was created by Stanley and Steve Ditko. And first appeared in strange tales.

9
00:00:25.551 --> 00:00:28.460
Number one 38 in 1965 and eternity,

10
00:00:28.550 --> 00:00:32.090
his origin goes back to the origin of the Marvel universe itself in the sense

11
00:00:32.091 --> 00:00:36.050
that in the time before the Marvel multiverse there existed one Sinthian

12
00:00:36.051 --> 00:00:36.590
universe,

13
00:00:36.590 --> 00:00:40.700
mostly composed of a being called the first firmament and the first firmament

14
00:00:40.730 --> 00:00:43.670
would grow lonely and then create for itself companions.

15
00:00:43.730 --> 00:00:47.120
Now some of those companions would turn against the first firmament and a civil

16
00:00:47.121 --> 00:00:50.300
war would erupt between them and the faction that remained loyal to it.

17
00:00:50.360 --> 00:00:51.410
Another rebellious group,

18
00:00:51.470 --> 00:00:54.830
the Celestials ultimately built weapons that were so powerful that they

19
00:00:54.831 --> 00:00:56.390
destroyed the first universe.

20
00:00:56.480 --> 00:00:59.720
And so the first photo then along with the ask for instead of remained loyal to

21
00:00:59.721 --> 00:01:00.890
it and, and not being killed,

22
00:01:01.220 --> 00:01:03.470
fled that universe and the shards of the first universe,

23
00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:06.470
then reformed and to what became the Marvel multiverse.

24
00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:10.430
Now the driving force behind the creation of this multi-verse was eternity,

25
00:01:10.460 --> 00:01:14.420
which would subsequently die and then be reborn several more times as the Marvel

26
00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:16.880
multi-verse is now in its eighth incarnation,

27
00:01:16.970 --> 00:01:20.060
following its destruction at the hands of the beyond hers and secret Wars by

28
00:01:20.061 --> 00:01:21.890
Jonathan Hickman and his following rebirth.

29
00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:26.210
And so as one of the Marvel abstracts eternity's powers are incredibly vast,

30
00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:28.550
so much so that he's nearly omnipotent.

31
00:01:28.580 --> 00:01:32.300
According to [inaudible] eternity is not as powerful as a living tribunal,

32
00:01:32.330 --> 00:01:35.930
but more powerful than the other cosmic abstracts, such as master order.

33
00:01:36.080 --> 00:01:36.890
And Lord chaos.

34
00:01:36.890 --> 00:01:41.810
Eternity has complete mastery over time and space and can manipulate reality on

35
00:01:41.811 --> 00:01:44.900
a multi-vessel level eternity, possesses omniscience,

36
00:01:44.920 --> 00:01:49.310
and is also able to impute others with cosmic awareness as it did when Reed

37
00:01:49.640 --> 00:01:51.920
Richard was being tried for saving the life of Galactus,

38
00:01:51.921 --> 00:01:55.280
which of course people were mad because I'm doing so he basically sealed the

39
00:01:55.281 --> 00:01:57.860
fate of all the planets Galactus would devour in the future,

40
00:01:57.861 --> 00:01:59.150
including the scroll home world,

41
00:01:59.180 --> 00:02:01.460
which resulted in the death of 7 billion scrolls.

42
00:02:01.490 --> 00:02:04.310
So reach put on trial for the desk. Electors had cause,

43
00:02:04.400 --> 00:02:06.410
and is only exonerated after eternity,

44
00:02:06.411 --> 00:02:08.600
as summoned by the watcher and Galactus and grants,

45
00:02:08.601 --> 00:02:12.830
the jurors cosmic awareness so that they know Galactus is a necessary component

46
00:02:12.831 --> 00:02:16.730
of the universe. And since we're dealing with a NY omnipotent entity here,

47
00:02:16.790 --> 00:02:20.210
the best way to get a sense of eternity's power level is probably to go over

48
00:02:20.211 --> 00:02:23.930
some of the most impressive things we've seen him do in several appearances.

49
00:02:24.050 --> 00:02:25.100
So that's what we're going to do here.

50
00:02:25.130 --> 00:02:28.520
Starting with looking at a character that's been defeated by eternity.

51
00:02:28.580 --> 00:02:32.510
And one of his earliest appearances eternity is challenged by Dormamuu one of

52
00:02:32.511 --> 00:02:33.171
the strongest,

53
00:02:33.171 --> 00:02:36.530
if not the strongest Wheeler of dark magic in the Marvel universe,

54
00:02:36.590 --> 00:02:39.470
even so Dormamuu who himself is well beyond.

55
00:02:39.471 --> 00:02:42.230
Omega level is easily dispatched by eternity.

56
00:02:42.260 --> 00:02:45.440
Eternity even makes the comment during a later meeting between the two

57
00:02:45.441 --> 00:02:49.700
characters that Dormamuu is not even significant enough for eternity to concern

58
00:02:49.701 --> 00:02:50.390
himself with.

59
00:02:50.390 --> 00:02:54.350
There is an instance later on when Dormamuu would combine his strength with that

60
00:02:54.351 --> 00:02:56.750
of his sister Umar. And it said that after doing that,

61
00:02:56.780 --> 00:03:00.100
he managed to defeat eternity and steal his power to remake the universe.

62
00:03:00.101 --> 00:03:03.100
According to his will. I mean, I kind of take this with a grain of salt though,

63
00:03:03.101 --> 00:03:07.240
because it happens like off panel and it just doesn't seem consistent with how

64
00:03:07.241 --> 00:03:10.600
these characters are typically written. But even though it's kind of an outlier,

65
00:03:10.660 --> 00:03:13.330
I did want to include it for the sake of providing as much information as I

66
00:03:13.331 --> 00:03:15.970
could, uh, after one of eternity's battles with Dormamuu,

67
00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:19.420
he was significantly weakened, which allowed another of, one of Dr. Strange,

68
00:03:19.540 --> 00:03:23.860
his perennial enemies nightmare to somehow blind eternity with chains of pure

69
00:03:23.861 --> 00:03:27.280
cosmic force, which allows nightmare to begin reshaping reality.

70
00:03:27.310 --> 00:03:30.880
Now eternity is eventually freed when nightmare in juggernaut who'd been trapped

71
00:03:30.881 --> 00:03:31.361
in the Crimson,

72
00:03:31.361 --> 00:03:35.500
cosmos unwittingly hit his chains with their mystic energies because juggernaut

73
00:03:35.501 --> 00:03:37.960
apparently learned how to cast spells during his time and exile.

74
00:03:37.990 --> 00:03:40.600
Although we Trinity States that he could have freed himself at any time,

75
00:03:40.780 --> 00:03:43.690
which sounds like the most eternity thing for eternity to say, right?

76
00:03:43.780 --> 00:03:45.910
Cause he's like a really proud being, you know, and it's like, well, I mean,

77
00:03:45.970 --> 00:03:50.560
you know, I, I would've freed myself eventually, but once freed eternity,

78
00:03:50.650 --> 00:03:54.880
effortlessly banishes nightmare and juggernaut into oblivion and then undoes all

79
00:03:54.881 --> 00:03:57.460
the changes nightmare had made to reality. Once again,

80
00:03:57.520 --> 00:03:59.590
displaying his own reality warping abilities,

81
00:03:59.650 --> 00:04:03.610
no another good measuring stick that we have available to show us the vast power

82
00:04:03.611 --> 00:04:06.850
that eternity has was something that we covered recently on this series.

83
00:04:06.880 --> 00:04:08.200
The story of Abraxis. Now,

84
00:04:08.201 --> 00:04:10.930
if you didn't watch that video and you don't know who Abraxis is,

85
00:04:10.931 --> 00:04:15.070
he is another cosmic abstract and as the embodiment of destruction and the

86
00:04:15.071 --> 00:04:17.590
multi-verse, he's basically eternity's opposite,

87
00:04:17.620 --> 00:04:21.610
but a Brock SIS has always existed within eternity and to keep them in check,

88
00:04:21.790 --> 00:04:22.960
we got Galactus. However,

89
00:04:23.020 --> 00:04:26.200
as the various versions of Galactus throughout the multi-verse are killed

90
00:04:26.230 --> 00:04:29.860
Abraxis is able to escape and wreak havoc across the multi-verse.

91
00:04:29.890 --> 00:04:32.740
No one have brought to this sets his sights on the six one six universe,

92
00:04:32.741 --> 00:04:36.100
the main Marvel universe Reed Richards knew there was no other alternative than

93
00:04:36.101 --> 00:04:39.520
to destroy all of reality with the ultimate notifier and then subsequently

94
00:04:39.521 --> 00:04:40.090
remake it.

95
00:04:40.090 --> 00:04:43.420
And so the fact that eternity is able to confine an entity as powerful as a

96
00:04:43.900 --> 00:04:44.620
Braxton within himself,

97
00:04:44.620 --> 00:04:48.460
and is also responsible for the creation of multiple Galactus in multiple

98
00:04:48.461 --> 00:04:51.520
universes, shows us just how powerful eternity is. Now.

99
00:04:51.521 --> 00:04:54.370
There are limits to eternity's power. For instance,

100
00:04:54.371 --> 00:04:57.700
he was defeated by Thanos when he wielded the infinity gauntlet and was also

101
00:04:57.701 --> 00:05:00.880
imprisoned by the Magnus in his quest to assemble the infinity stones,

102
00:05:00.940 --> 00:05:02.110
eternity would however,

103
00:05:02.140 --> 00:05:06.220
merge with a sister infinity to take the power of the infinity stones away from

104
00:05:06.221 --> 00:05:09.280
the magazine and when to be honors destroy the Marvel multi-verse in the

105
00:05:09.730 --> 00:05:12.610
timeline's out storyline. They take out eternity in the process. However,

106
00:05:12.670 --> 00:05:16.660
as I stated earlier, eternity is resurrected along with a Marvel multi-verse.

107
00:05:16.720 --> 00:05:19.210
Now recently eternity was in prison. Once again,

108
00:05:19.240 --> 00:05:22.960
this time by the first ferment who had actually been allowed entry into the

109
00:05:23.500 --> 00:05:24.550
multi-verse due to his weakened state,

110
00:05:24.580 --> 00:05:26.950
as a result of being destroyed and recreated,

111
00:05:26.980 --> 00:05:30.880
it should also be noted that it was not merely an aspect of eternity that was in

112
00:05:31.270 --> 00:05:34.030
prison, which is what we usually see interacting with human characters,

113
00:05:34.060 --> 00:05:36.730
but the entire entity of eternity itself,

114
00:05:36.760 --> 00:05:39.760
which embodies all of life in the multi-verse. Now,

115
00:05:39.761 --> 00:05:43.330
eternity is eventually free by the combined efforts of blue Marvel and the

116
00:05:43.331 --> 00:05:46.750
ultimate, and then battles the first firmament who infects them with a virus.

117
00:05:46.810 --> 00:05:48.130
Now, once the virus is purged,

118
00:05:48.160 --> 00:05:51.310
eternity remembers his true nature and summons to his side,

119
00:05:51.340 --> 00:05:55.510
a group he refers to as the ultimate ultimate the embodiments of the multi

120
00:05:55.840 --> 00:05:56.290
versus past.

121
00:05:56.290 --> 00:05:59.750
Now each of these ultimate Ultimate's are extremely powerful entities.

122
00:05:59.810 --> 00:06:02.150
One being the originator of magic, one,

123
00:06:02.151 --> 00:06:05.780
the inventor of science and one being eternity, sister, self, infinity,

124
00:06:05.810 --> 00:06:09.530
and eternity was able to summon them to aside instantaneously. And so,

125
00:06:09.531 --> 00:06:12.890
although eternity is not omnipotent and has been defeated,

126
00:06:12.920 --> 00:06:15.230
he usually overcomes whatever defeats. He suffers,

127
00:06:15.290 --> 00:06:18.350
even to the point of resurrecting. Each time he's destroyed.

128
00:06:18.410 --> 00:06:21.560
And since eternity is the embodiment of all life and the multi-verse,

129
00:06:21.590 --> 00:06:25.430
his resurrection means that reality, as we know, it can continue to exist.

130
00:06:25.460 --> 00:06:28.160
So with that being said, guys, we're gonna bring this video to an end. Yeah.

131
00:06:28.190 --> 00:06:31.010
Needless to say, eternity's incredibly powerful, right?

132
00:06:31.011 --> 00:06:34.130
This is a wildly powerful being. And I kind of figured you guys all knew that,

133
00:06:34.190 --> 00:06:34.491
right? I mean,

134
00:06:34.491 --> 00:06:37.550
he's like the top tier of the cosmic entities in any one universe, but yeah,

135
00:06:37.670 --> 00:06:39.140
it's kind of nuts. What would that being said, guys,

136
00:06:39.141 --> 00:06:41.870
we're gonna bring this video to an end. If you guys are new here to college,

137
00:06:41.871 --> 00:06:42.561
explain the mission.

138
00:06:42.561 --> 00:06:44.810
You guys have the sub button to become part of the rod core.

139
00:06:44.811 --> 00:06:45.800
If you guys enjoyed this video,

140
00:06:45.860 --> 00:06:48.770
make sure you drop a light and I will catch you all later.
