00:00:11.040 --> 00:00:11.750
Okay.

5
00:00:11.750 --> 00:00:14.780
<v 1>So we are picking back up again with a Spiderman part two.</v>

6
00:00:14.781 --> 00:00:17.360
And this week we're going to kind of run through a whole bunch of Spider-Man

7
00:00:17.361 --> 00:00:18.140
related content,

8
00:00:18.140 --> 00:00:20.450
mostly because of the fact that the new Spider-Man games coming out,

9
00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:23.540
we kind of want to be done in time for all of that stuff. But, um,

10
00:00:23.600 --> 00:00:25.430
and this one we pick up with part two right now, again,

11
00:00:25.431 --> 00:00:27.170
for those of you guys who are just joining us here,

12
00:00:27.800 --> 00:00:30.530
Spider-Man is the first time that Peter Parker from the main Marvel universe

13
00:00:30.560 --> 00:00:33.950
meets miles Morales, the new Spider-Man in the ultimate universe, right?

14
00:00:33.951 --> 00:00:35.300
This is a big deal. When it first came out.

15
00:00:35.330 --> 00:00:38.180
Now we ended up having this happening by way of the fact that, uh,

16
00:00:38.810 --> 00:00:41.450
Mysteria had basically managed to create some kind of interdimensional portal.

17
00:00:41.480 --> 00:00:44.360
And the result was that when Peter Parker came upon it and he ended up finding

18
00:00:44.361 --> 00:00:46.580
Mysterio, Peter Parker ended up being thrown through, right.

19
00:00:46.640 --> 00:00:48.290
He was kind of sucked through more than anything else.

20
00:00:48.291 --> 00:00:51.110
But Peter Parker passed through it ended up in the ultimate universe.

21
00:00:51.140 --> 00:00:54.800
What this does is it wakes up with Mysterio in the aftermath of that. Now,

22
00:00:54.801 --> 00:00:58.160
as soon as the material comes to his immediate response is really bro,

23
00:01:00.020 --> 00:01:03.110
he's incredibly off, right? Because he's just like, this is the worst thing.

24
00:01:03.111 --> 00:01:05.390
Now it's not like super complicated or anything.

25
00:01:05.391 --> 00:01:06.830
That's one of the great things about Brian,

26
00:01:06.831 --> 00:01:09.770
Michael Bendis when he was writing really ultimate Spider-Man and miles Morales,

27
00:01:10.250 --> 00:01:12.920
Spiderman. I always say Bennet's is better when he's writing kids are teenagers.

28
00:01:12.950 --> 00:01:15.860
When it comes to adults, he's not that good, but with kids or teenagers,

29
00:01:15.890 --> 00:01:18.950
he's amazing. Right? So riding miles, Morales, he was super good at it.

30
00:01:18.980 --> 00:01:21.650
But the idea behind this is that from mysterious perspective,

31
00:01:21.680 --> 00:01:25.850
he does not want to run into another situation where Peter Parker exists,

32
00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:28.970
but him basically stumbling across the ultimate universe was a universe where

33
00:01:28.971 --> 00:01:30.920
Peter Parker Spider-Man didn't really exist.

34
00:01:30.950 --> 00:01:33.840
Peter Parker had never heard of Mysterio. And so with him, you know,

35
00:01:33.860 --> 00:01:35.540
really presuming that miles Morales, the,

36
00:01:35.541 --> 00:01:38.240
that he knew miles existed there miles could be somebody he could overcome

37
00:01:38.241 --> 00:01:40.640
pretty, pretty quickly, right? Because by and large,

38
00:01:40.641 --> 00:01:42.530
when it comes to Marvel comics, villains from the,

39
00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:46.040
from the main Marvel universe are usually more powerful from villain of the

40
00:01:46.041 --> 00:01:48.890
villains, from the ultimate universe and even main characters themselves,

41
00:01:48.950 --> 00:01:51.650
even somebody like the Phoenix force or like Thor or Loki,

42
00:01:51.680 --> 00:01:54.320
they're really powerful characters in relation to their, uh,

43
00:01:54.350 --> 00:01:56.960
to their ultimate universe counterparts because the ultimate universe was

44
00:01:56.961 --> 00:02:00.350
designed to be more toned down and realistic, even in the realm of comic books,

45
00:02:00.530 --> 00:02:04.160
if you're writing a character and really a series of stories that exist as close

46
00:02:04.161 --> 00:02:05.360
as you can get to the real world,

47
00:02:05.390 --> 00:02:08.420
you probably don't want to really see these wild flights of fantasy when it

48
00:02:08.421 --> 00:02:10.580
comes to ridiculous level of, uh, levels of power, right?

49
00:02:10.580 --> 00:02:12.470
Like the marquee of death, different things like that.

50
00:02:12.560 --> 00:02:15.470
But the whole idea here is that what you end up having is mysterious,

51
00:02:15.490 --> 00:02:17.840
who basically kind of brings out this kind of avatar.

52
00:02:17.900 --> 00:02:19.550
And this is basically a version of himself,

53
00:02:19.580 --> 00:02:22.520
kind of a robotic version of himself that can go into the ultimate universe in a

54
00:02:22.880 --> 00:02:24.110
stet, right? Because if you're Mysterio,

55
00:02:24.170 --> 00:02:26.420
you don't want to get yourself killed going into the ultimate universe.

56
00:02:27.260 --> 00:02:30.560
You send a robot in your place. And so switching over to Peter and miles,

57
00:02:30.590 --> 00:02:33.560
this is one of the interesting things here, albeit a little strange.

58
00:02:33.620 --> 00:02:37.580
And the reason why is because initially Peter doesn't know what to make of miles

59
00:02:37.581 --> 00:02:39.440
and miles doesn't know what to make of Peter, right?

60
00:02:39.441 --> 00:02:42.200
He's like one of the worlds going on and Peter hasn't figured out that he's in

61
00:02:42.201 --> 00:02:44.450
the ultimate universe because he doesn't know what the ultimate union of a

62
00:02:44.451 --> 00:02:47.150
universe is. He just knows he's in some other place. Right.

63
00:02:47.151 --> 00:02:50.210
And seemingly picking up pretty quickly on the fact that he's in some kind of an

64
00:02:50.211 --> 00:02:52.910
alternate dimension. And so because of this, there's a, you know,

65
00:02:52.920 --> 00:02:56.090
kind of fight that starts to break out between Peter and miles' because Peter is

66
00:02:56.091 --> 00:02:57.590
like, okay, you're freaking me out. Right?

67
00:02:57.591 --> 00:02:59.560
Because they keep going back and forth, right. Peter's like,

68
00:02:59.561 --> 00:03:01.930
what's the deal here. Miles is like, you tell me. And Peter's like,

69
00:03:01.931 --> 00:03:04.030
is it a clone thing? And he's like, what's a clone thing. He was like,

70
00:03:04.031 --> 00:03:06.250
you tell me, he's like, I thought it was some kind of Nick fury test.

71
00:03:06.520 --> 00:03:08.710
Isn't a Nick fury test. And miles was like, you tell me. And it's like,

72
00:03:08.800 --> 00:03:11.320
you know, just kind of going back and forth. Right. So Peter gets frustrated,

73
00:03:11.350 --> 00:03:14.410
gets a little, uh, it gets a little tough and, uh, ends up attacking miles,

74
00:03:14.411 --> 00:03:17.860
right. Is up going after miles but miles for his part immediately Dodges,

75
00:03:18.460 --> 00:03:19.900
Spiderman, weapon. Right? And so from there,

76
00:03:19.960 --> 00:03:23.800
what you end up getting is this really interesting situation where miles is able

77
00:03:23.801 --> 00:03:27.340
to Bob and weave and duck all of Spider-Man's attacks and then counter

78
00:03:27.341 --> 00:03:30.700
proportionally. Now this is where things get a little wonky, right?

79
00:03:30.701 --> 00:03:33.850
This is where things get a little, I don't know how I feel about that, right?

80
00:03:33.851 --> 00:03:34.684
Because keep in mind,

81
00:03:35.290 --> 00:03:39.050
Myles has not been formally trained by anybody at shield yet. Right.

82
00:03:39.340 --> 00:03:41.920
And anybody in this risk, Elliot by Nick theory or any of those guys.

83
00:03:41.950 --> 00:03:44.950
And so he is still in a lot of ways flying by the seat of his pants.

84
00:03:44.980 --> 00:03:47.320
And so the fact that we're kind of getting this version of miles,

85
00:03:47.321 --> 00:03:51.400
who over his time in being Spider-Man is able to go toe to toe with Peter

86
00:03:51.400 --> 00:03:51.430
Parker.

87
00:03:51.430 --> 00:03:54.460
Who's been playing this role for a very long time and not only go toe to toe

88
00:03:54.490 --> 00:03:58.090
manage the Dodges attacks and then shock him is a little bit stunning here,

89
00:03:58.091 --> 00:04:00.130
but no pun intended. There's a little bit stunning here.

90
00:04:00.160 --> 00:04:03.190
But the funny thing about this too, is we can also kind of play into it,

91
00:04:03.250 --> 00:04:06.970
into it from Peter's perspective that Peter is not fighting to like beat the

92
00:04:06.971 --> 00:04:10.030
crap out of miles. Right. He's not looking to like overcome miles.

93
00:04:10.060 --> 00:04:12.280
He's looking to kind of subdue him, everything else. Right.

94
00:04:12.281 --> 00:04:14.020
Probably web him up or something like that.

95
00:04:14.080 --> 00:04:16.840
If Peter were fighting miles in the same vein that he was fighting,

96
00:04:16.841 --> 00:04:19.990
somebody like rhino or like Dr. Octopus or somebody like that,

97
00:04:20.020 --> 00:04:22.150
the fight probably would have gone a much different way.

98
00:04:22.151 --> 00:04:23.860
And it would have been over much, much faster.

99
00:04:23.890 --> 00:04:26.170
The reality is which way this fight would have gone.

100
00:04:26.200 --> 00:04:30.070
Depends on which character you like more, that's basically what it is. Right.

101
00:04:30.071 --> 00:04:31.660
If you're a fan of miles, you're like, yo of course,

102
00:04:31.661 --> 00:04:33.640
miles can overcome Peter Parker. If you don't believe me,

103
00:04:33.641 --> 00:04:36.100
just ask me and I'll tell you, but if you're a fan of Peter Parker,

104
00:04:36.160 --> 00:04:37.630
it's the exact same thing. Right. I was like, no,

105
00:04:37.660 --> 00:04:40.140
Peter Parker definitely could've gotten the upper hand on miles. Right. I mean,

106
00:04:40.141 --> 00:04:42.700
I know because I'm right, right. I mean, that's, that's kind of how we,

107
00:04:42.850 --> 00:04:45.850
it's kinda good fans get, we need no other evidence than our own opinion.

108
00:04:45.880 --> 00:04:47.260
And that's basically it. Now,

109
00:04:47.261 --> 00:04:50.860
the funny thing is miles actually goes to take the mask off Peter,

110
00:04:50.861 --> 00:04:53.350
which miles should know by now is kind of a no-no,

111
00:04:53.380 --> 00:04:55.450
that's just something that you don't do. And that leads to Peter,

112
00:04:55.451 --> 00:04:56.620
basically reacting, you know,

113
00:04:56.621 --> 00:04:59.200
waking up and then kicking miles off the ledge of the building. Right.

114
00:04:59.201 --> 00:05:00.790
And then from there Peter's like, dude, I think I just.

115
00:05:00.790 --> 00:05:01.623
<v 2>Killed this kid.</v>

116
00:05:03.070 --> 00:05:06.370
<v 1>I think I just did this kid in, uh, I do not need that on my conscious, right.</v>

117
00:05:06.400 --> 00:05:09.730
I do not need this on my conscious. Now unbeknownst to him, of course,

118
00:05:10.210 --> 00:05:12.760
miles has initiated his invisibility power, but nonetheless,

119
00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:15.820
Peter's just kind of like, uh, okay. I think I killed this kid. This was a,

120
00:05:15.830 --> 00:05:19.090
this is a problem. We got to find this kid. Right. And then miles pops back up,

121
00:05:19.120 --> 00:05:20.830
gets the upper hand on Peter kicks him.

122
00:05:20.860 --> 00:05:23.500
And then of course Peter ends up kind of spinning some wedding outs.

123
00:05:23.530 --> 00:05:27.100
And then from there he chooses webbing into miles' mask and yanks his mask off.

124
00:05:27.101 --> 00:05:28.340
Right. And that's what he's kind of like, alright,

125
00:05:28.660 --> 00:05:31.420
it's time for you to come clean. Right? Like how are you Spiderman?

126
00:05:31.480 --> 00:05:33.820
What's going on here? Like, like give me all the skinny,

127
00:05:33.830 --> 00:05:35.590
give me all the information on the response of miles.

128
00:05:35.590 --> 00:05:37.480
If you have to give me my mask back, right?

129
00:05:37.481 --> 00:05:41.170
Like anybody out here could see that I'm Spiderman and I have to keep my family

130
00:05:41.260 --> 00:05:43.930
and my identity protected, like, give me my mask back.

131
00:05:43.990 --> 00:05:46.810
Now you would expect Peter to respond and say, yeah,

132
00:05:46.811 --> 00:05:49.600
I kind of understand where you're coming from. That's kind of my thing too.

133
00:05:49.630 --> 00:05:53.260
But desperate times call for desperate measures and Peter needs information.

134
00:05:53.290 --> 00:05:56.470
The problem with this is he didn't really understand why miles got the upper

135
00:05:56.471 --> 00:05:57.560
hand on him the first time.

136
00:05:57.620 --> 00:05:59.900
And so he didn't really even think about the venom blast this time,

137
00:05:59.930 --> 00:06:03.080
which miles uses channels that into the end of the webbing and then takes out

138
00:06:03.081 --> 00:06:04.400
Peter it's genius.

139
00:06:04.460 --> 00:06:07.760
And that was one of the cool things that made miles so interesting in the early

140
00:06:07.761 --> 00:06:09.620
comics is when you were reading his character,

141
00:06:09.621 --> 00:06:11.330
you could actually watch him become a biter,

142
00:06:11.360 --> 00:06:13.370
a better Spider-Man as you were reading the comics.

143
00:06:13.400 --> 00:06:15.530
And so with every single story arc that you read,

144
00:06:15.560 --> 00:06:18.800
he was a better version of Spider-Man at the end of that story than he was

145
00:06:18.801 --> 00:06:21.140
before he started the story. But it was really, really cool.

146
00:06:21.170 --> 00:06:23.420
But with regards to Peter, what you end up getting here is a,

147
00:06:23.430 --> 00:06:26.840
is miles basically using Peter's web shooters, right. To kind of swing them,

148
00:06:26.900 --> 00:06:28.250
you know, down to down on the ground.

149
00:06:28.251 --> 00:06:30.590
And they kind of get them onto a roof and they get them to safety.

150
00:06:30.620 --> 00:06:31.820
And when they collapse, right,

151
00:06:31.821 --> 00:06:35.000
he ends up taking the mask off Peter and he realizes, Oh my God,

152
00:06:35.001 --> 00:06:36.350
this is Peter Parker. Now for him,

153
00:06:36.380 --> 00:06:38.540
he doesn't know this is Peter from the Marvel universe,

154
00:06:38.541 --> 00:06:39.710
from the main Marvel universe. Right.

155
00:06:39.740 --> 00:06:42.290
He thinks just like Peter Parker returned from his universe. So he's like,

156
00:06:42.291 --> 00:06:44.330
I have no idea what I do here. Right.

157
00:06:44.331 --> 00:06:46.640
And that's what he kind of looks over to the triskelion and Peter Parker is

158
00:06:46.641 --> 00:06:49.550
taken to the shield headquarters, right? From there, he meets with Nick fury.

159
00:06:49.580 --> 00:06:51.410
Now most of the guys who read the ultimate universe,

160
00:06:51.650 --> 00:06:52.850
no two things about Nick fury.

161
00:06:52.880 --> 00:06:56.240
The first one is that he was based on Samuel Jackson. Right. And in fact,

162
00:06:56.241 --> 00:06:58.250
Samuel Jackson actually threatened to Sue Marvel,

163
00:06:58.280 --> 00:07:01.160
but they ended up letting him play the role of Nick fury in the MCU.

164
00:07:01.220 --> 00:07:03.770
So the lawsuit never happened. Right. That's why we got Samuel Jackson,

165
00:07:03.771 --> 00:07:07.490
Nick fury. But the other thing about this is that Nick fury is highly skeptical.

166
00:07:07.700 --> 00:07:11.270
Right? He is a super suspicious guy. And so when he starts asking questions,

167
00:07:11.271 --> 00:07:12.680
when he starts asking him like, well,

168
00:07:12.681 --> 00:07:15.290
at least when we first do them as Peter and Peter's like, like, do you know me?

169
00:07:15.291 --> 00:07:17.300
And he's like, I know the name, you know? And it's that kind of a thing.

170
00:07:17.301 --> 00:07:19.280
He started the two of them start talking to each other.

171
00:07:19.370 --> 00:07:21.470
And it's kind of a cool bit of a conversation here. Right.

172
00:07:21.471 --> 00:07:24.020
Because Peter even makes reference to the fact that like, I know your eyepatch,

173
00:07:24.050 --> 00:07:26.120
but it's, it's, it's one of these little, these little tidbit things.

174
00:07:26.121 --> 00:07:28.730
But when he asks him like, you know, are you Peter Parker? It's like, well,

175
00:07:28.731 --> 00:07:31.070
it's not that straightforward. And I was like, okay, well then give me a,

176
00:07:31.071 --> 00:07:33.680
give me an answer. Like give me this one hypothetical answer that you have.

177
00:07:33.710 --> 00:07:36.140
And Peter basically reiterate this whole fight with Mysterio,

178
00:07:36.290 --> 00:07:38.570
then passing through the portal and the Indigo here and all that kind of stuff.

179
00:07:38.600 --> 00:07:40.910
And Nick curious, kind of like, huh, okay. I mean,

180
00:07:40.911 --> 00:07:44.300
I could probably buy that story. It's so farfetched. It might just be true.

181
00:07:44.360 --> 00:07:45.800
Right. It's just, it's one of those things.

182
00:07:45.801 --> 00:07:47.780
So we just kind of ended up getting Peter credibility here.

183
00:07:47.781 --> 00:07:51.410
Now the reality of this is that Bendis does this just for the sake of keeping

184
00:07:51.411 --> 00:07:54.860
the story moving forward under any other comic in the ultimate universe,

185
00:07:54.890 --> 00:07:56.780
Nick fury would be like, no, I'm not buying that.

186
00:07:56.780 --> 00:07:59.120
You're going to stay in this cell until you tell me what's actually going on.

187
00:07:59.180 --> 00:08:01.970
And he would legitimately leave him there. Leak-free would've done that. If you,

188
00:08:01.971 --> 00:08:02.331
if you,

189
00:08:02.331 --> 00:08:05.510
if you said that this happened in the Ultimate's and it was anybody else besides

190
00:08:05.930 --> 00:08:05.990
Spiderman,

191
00:08:05.990 --> 00:08:09.950
if it was ultimate or like the ultimate fantastic four or the ultimate X-Men

192
00:08:09.980 --> 00:08:13.040
Nick fury will be like, no, man, I'm not buying into that. That nonsense,

193
00:08:13.041 --> 00:08:15.590
that crazy malarkey not buying into that, any of that stuff. Right.

194
00:08:15.591 --> 00:08:16.460
So he would just leave him there,

195
00:08:16.461 --> 00:08:19.460
but Bendis does this for the sake of keeping the story moving forward.

196
00:08:19.490 --> 00:08:22.700
What he ends up doing is basically handing Peter over to miles and say, okay,

197
00:08:22.760 --> 00:08:24.800
it's your all's job to go do your own thing, right?

198
00:08:24.801 --> 00:08:27.650
Your all's job to get this whole thing sorted out and find out what's going on.

199
00:08:27.651 --> 00:08:30.590
And so what Peter does is by virtue of what Nick fury told him,

200
00:08:30.591 --> 00:08:32.300
the way that miles is acting, that kind of thing,

201
00:08:32.301 --> 00:08:33.710
he starts to put two and two together.

202
00:08:33.740 --> 00:08:36.260
And so what he does is he really kind of asks the big question,

203
00:08:36.261 --> 00:08:39.710
like tell me kid in this universe is Peter Parker dead, right?

204
00:08:39.711 --> 00:08:41.570
Is Peter Parker not alive here anymore?

205
00:08:41.630 --> 00:08:44.570
And this was kind of nuts is because before miles can really give them an answer

206
00:08:44.571 --> 00:08:45.470
and explain everything.

207
00:08:45.500 --> 00:08:49.130
Both of them are shot through the helicopter by this avatar of Mysterio.

208
00:08:49.220 --> 00:08:53.240
And in turn miles basically saves both of them and then kind of takes both guys

209
00:08:53.330 --> 00:08:55.620
or really takes him in the pilot down to their safety. Right.

210
00:08:55.650 --> 00:08:58.920
But basically Mysterio is here and starts launching his attack against, uh,

211
00:08:58.921 --> 00:09:02.370
against Peter and miles. So this is when we go from miles Morales,

212
00:09:02.400 --> 00:09:05.940
meeting Peter Parker to miles fighting Peter to miles and Peter teaming up.

213
00:09:05.970 --> 00:09:08.040
So with that being said, guys, we're gonna bring this video to an end.

214
00:09:08.070 --> 00:09:09.360
