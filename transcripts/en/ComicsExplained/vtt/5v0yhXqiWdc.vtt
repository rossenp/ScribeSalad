00:00:04.411 --> 00:00:08.970
guys hit the like button, if you enjoyed the video and yeah. Let's begin.

4
00:00:11.220 --> 00:00:11.690
Okay.

5
00:00:11.690 --> 00:00:15.530
<v 1>So we are continuing on with swords of X and in this video we're picking up with</v>

6
00:00:15.590 --> 00:00:19.190
X-Force. Yes we are. And the continuation of this battle.

7
00:00:19.191 --> 00:00:22.100
So the swords of X event, it gets a little wonky here, right?

8
00:00:22.101 --> 00:00:24.530
Like I always thought it would actually be a duel with swords,

9
00:00:24.531 --> 00:00:25.820
like strictly with swords.

10
00:00:25.880 --> 00:00:28.610
Apparently that's not really the case at the start of this whole thing.

11
00:00:28.611 --> 00:00:32.120
The score is a Rocco five cacoa three. We ended up having a Rocco, getting,

12
00:00:32.121 --> 00:00:34.070
getting a six point. Then they get a seventh point.

13
00:00:34.071 --> 00:00:36.710
Then they get an eighth point. Agricola just keeps falling behind.

14
00:00:36.711 --> 00:00:39.380
And it's these various weird and wonky competitions, right?

15
00:00:39.381 --> 00:00:42.050
Like who can push a Boulder up a Hill or like who can,

16
00:00:42.080 --> 00:00:44.930
who can basically out swim monsters and survive. Ah,

17
00:00:44.960 --> 00:00:47.690
you have an eating contest where you get foods from the cricket world.

18
00:00:47.720 --> 00:00:51.440
There's a dance off, which apparently a cipher does amazingly well. Right.

19
00:00:51.441 --> 00:00:53.690
He absolutely crushes it. So he gets a point on there.

20
00:00:53.700 --> 00:00:56.600
It's like Penrose steps that they have to navigate through. Uh,

21
00:00:56.630 --> 00:00:58.130
they have to put together a puzzle, right.

22
00:00:58.131 --> 00:01:01.250
So like Precoa gets a win on that because I guess the forces of Morocco,

23
00:01:01.251 --> 00:01:02.810
aren't the sharpest tool in the shed. We,

24
00:01:02.811 --> 00:01:05.540
the way it was had to be dominant because it was forces from the same side,

25
00:01:05.541 --> 00:01:08.420
but then like you end up having a runway walk off, which I didn't even know.

26
00:01:08.421 --> 00:01:11.050
That was really like, I guess it was a contest in terms of like, I don't,

27
00:01:11.051 --> 00:01:12.260
I don't know. I don't really do runways.

28
00:01:12.290 --> 00:01:16.400
I know there's a show about runways anyway, storm crushes it. Right.

29
00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:18.980
And a lot of that's attributed to the fact that it's because she might be drunk,

30
00:01:19.010 --> 00:01:20.780
but like consistently across the board,

31
00:01:20.781 --> 00:01:23.900
they're just kind of like these wonky and goofy competitions. Right.

32
00:01:23.901 --> 00:01:26.450
They're just sort of weird and almost nonsensical.

33
00:01:26.510 --> 00:01:29.210
The other thing about this is that you ended up having Brian Bradick,

34
00:01:29.360 --> 00:01:32.060
who's still kind of continuing on he's within the crooked market itself and kind

35
00:01:32.061 --> 00:01:33.590
of continuing on and a little, uh,

36
00:01:33.591 --> 00:01:36.320
still a little approached about the fact that like Betsy Braddock's basically

37
00:01:36.590 --> 00:01:36.920
debt, right?

38
00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:39.890
And so you end up having him met by Saturday and Saturday and who again,

39
00:01:39.891 --> 00:01:41.090
refers to him as captain Britain.

40
00:01:41.091 --> 00:01:44.210
He basically disregards that says I'm not captain Britain. Don't call me that.

41
00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:46.220
She ultimately says like the title is yours.

42
00:01:46.310 --> 00:01:49.550
And if you won't come around to being captain Britain willingly,

43
00:01:49.640 --> 00:01:51.020
then fury will work. Right.

44
00:01:51.021 --> 00:01:53.690
And she basically seems to have the Fury's at our back. Now,

45
00:01:53.720 --> 00:01:56.180
one of the other things that goes on here and is something that I'm not a

46
00:01:56.181 --> 00:01:58.700
hundred percent sure I'm on the fence about is you have Jim Jasper's

47
00:01:58.701 --> 00:02:00.050
encountering captain Britain again,

48
00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:02.600
but captain Britain doesn't really seem to give any indication that he knows who

49
00:02:02.601 --> 00:02:05.450
he is. And it would have been a cool little, a cool little nod, um,

50
00:02:05.480 --> 00:02:07.370
in the sense that you, you would have Jim Jasper is like,

51
00:02:07.400 --> 00:02:10.280
it's good to see you again, captain, I'm sorry. Things ended so weird last time,

52
00:02:10.281 --> 00:02:13.040
but you know, you tried to kill me and everything.

53
00:02:13.070 --> 00:02:15.740
It would have been cool to see that by just kind of a little reference to the

54
00:02:16.040 --> 00:02:18.320
cricket world from back in the day, it may be that it's just kind of like,

55
00:02:18.350 --> 00:02:20.270
you know, mobile doesn't really care or Hickman doesn't really care.

56
00:02:20.360 --> 00:02:23.840
I don't really know, but it would've been a cool little nod, you know, to see,

57
00:02:23.841 --> 00:02:25.250
because I love that story so much.

58
00:02:25.280 --> 00:02:28.190
And I love the character of Jim Jasper's because he's just so broken and

59
00:02:28.220 --> 00:02:28.960
overpowered.

60
00:02:28.960 --> 00:02:32.570
You end up having this thing where it's basically a race between red root and

61
00:02:32.900 --> 00:02:36.050
Brian Bradick and red root is of course more or less a shrub and she's super

62
00:02:36.051 --> 00:02:39.800
slow. But in the midst of all this, when, when, uh, when Madam Jasper says like,

63
00:02:39.801 --> 00:02:42.140
you'll be able to find the finish line around here somewhere, right?

64
00:02:42.190 --> 00:02:44.600
If you look hard enough, you can find anything in a cricket market,

65
00:02:44.630 --> 00:02:45.710
including a finish line.

66
00:02:45.740 --> 00:02:48.320
Once the gunfire goes off and Brian Braddock starts running,

67
00:02:48.350 --> 00:02:50.600
he's immediately set upon by these Fury's right.

68
00:02:50.601 --> 00:02:54.220
These fairies all immediately go after him because it's basically Saturday

69
00:02:54.320 --> 00:02:57.740
working against the we're against Brian Braddock and the forces of Kakowa

70
00:02:58.040 --> 00:03:00.340
because Brian Radek basically won't be her guy, right.

71
00:03:00.341 --> 00:03:02.950
He just won't go with her. Right. He just refuses to bend the knees,

72
00:03:02.951 --> 00:03:04.750
so to speak and to, you know, be the,

73
00:03:04.810 --> 00:03:07.600
whatever it is that Saturday and wants out of him. Right. A concubine.

74
00:03:07.601 --> 00:03:08.650
I don't know. I don't really know.

75
00:03:08.710 --> 00:03:11.810
Regardless red root basically begins a process of just kind of, of,

76
00:03:11.811 --> 00:03:14.350
of passing them up. And of course, she's kind of walking in walking,

77
00:03:14.351 --> 00:03:18.310
but she ends up bumping into this table and shatters a crystal that happens to

78
00:03:18.311 --> 00:03:20.560
land at the foot of Jim Jasper's and just kind of says,

79
00:03:20.590 --> 00:03:23.140
everything has a cost of the market, right. Everything. Now, of course,

80
00:03:23.141 --> 00:03:25.420
she continues on blissfully unaware of what's happening.

81
00:03:25.570 --> 00:03:27.340
And then ultimately crosses the finish line,

82
00:03:27.341 --> 00:03:30.160
which is something like five feet away from them now, Saturday.

83
00:03:30.161 --> 00:03:33.400
And of course does this just for the sake of giving the point to a Rocco, right?

84
00:03:33.401 --> 00:03:36.910
So it is again like the, the contest is basically rig,

85
00:03:36.940 --> 00:03:38.770
but we're grind Bradick is basically subdued.

86
00:03:38.800 --> 00:03:41.920
Jim Jaspers starts talking to red root and says, okay, so like,

87
00:03:41.980 --> 00:03:44.320
now there's the matter of your debt? And she's like, what are you talking about?

88
00:03:44.321 --> 00:03:48.010
He's like, you shattered a crystal, right? This rare crystal idle of Bombay,

89
00:03:48.040 --> 00:03:52.390
right? Crafted from assault of an Oompa Ghanian, princesses tears.

90
00:03:52.391 --> 00:03:55.240
I don't really know what that is, but he's basically like it was priceless,

91
00:03:55.241 --> 00:03:58.420
right? Everything here has a price. If you break something that's priceless,

92
00:03:58.450 --> 00:03:59.800
you have to deal with it accordingly.

93
00:03:59.890 --> 00:04:02.620
And so visually with the whole process being done and sat our,

94
00:04:02.900 --> 00:04:03.970
sending the Fury's away,

95
00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:06.850
which is also a little bit disappointed that Brian brag doesn't recognize who

96
00:04:06.851 --> 00:04:08.020
they are. That in turn,

97
00:04:08.050 --> 00:04:12.250
Jim Jaspers uses his ability to manipulate reality and shrinks red root down.

98
00:04:12.251 --> 00:04:14.500
And encases her in glass and leaves her there.

99
00:04:14.530 --> 00:04:16.270
Like she's literally just kind of stuck there,

100
00:04:16.300 --> 00:04:19.180
forevermore seemingly never to be able to escape.

101
00:04:19.210 --> 00:04:20.380
And so with that being the case,

102
00:04:20.410 --> 00:04:25.180
you in turn have a Saturday who basically says like you have done untold damage

103
00:04:25.240 --> 00:04:26.920
to the crooked market, right? I mean,

104
00:04:26.921 --> 00:04:29.020
there's no calculating how much damage you've done here.

105
00:04:29.080 --> 00:04:31.390
Everything here is irreplaceable, right?

106
00:04:31.391 --> 00:04:33.580
So if red root was shrunk down for what she did,

107
00:04:33.610 --> 00:04:36.190
God only knows what Jim Jasper is going to do to you.

108
00:04:36.250 --> 00:04:39.370
Unless of course you asked for my help. If you ask for my help,

109
00:04:39.430 --> 00:04:41.710
then Jim Jasper's won't do anything to you now,

110
00:04:41.740 --> 00:04:44.920
whether or not that's what he did. We're not given a definitive answer to.

111
00:04:44.980 --> 00:04:45.401
Instead,

112
00:04:45.401 --> 00:04:49.510
what we ended up doing is switching over to these two interesting scenarios that

113
00:04:49.511 --> 00:04:51.370
go on in terms of part of this contest, right?

114
00:04:51.371 --> 00:04:54.280
The first one comes in the form of magic where she has to answer a riddle.

115
00:04:54.340 --> 00:04:57.490
If she gets the answer, right. Uh, then of course she gets a point.

116
00:04:57.520 --> 00:05:02.080
If she gets a wrong, then she loses, right? So the riddle is a white rabbit,

117
00:05:02.110 --> 00:05:06.280
pulled out of a black top hat and a spell cast by a wizard and the very life

118
00:05:06.281 --> 00:05:08.890
force of Saturday. What am I? And she basically says,

119
00:05:08.891 --> 00:05:12.550
that's an easy one magic and it's spelled mag. I K and she's wrong.

120
00:05:13.900 --> 00:05:17.590
So she got that one wrong because she's an idiot. But with, with Wolverine and,

121
00:05:17.860 --> 00:05:19.810
uh, and, and white sword is a little bit different.

122
00:05:19.840 --> 00:05:23.110
They have to stand in front of a mirror and they have to observe the faces of

123
00:05:23.111 --> 00:05:25.930
all the people they've killed. The first one to look away,

124
00:05:25.990 --> 00:05:30.700
loses the first one to blink loses Wolverine actually ends up crying and ends up

125
00:05:30.701 --> 00:05:31.360
blinking. Now,

126
00:05:31.360 --> 00:05:34.300
this is designed to kind of compare these two characters between each other,

127
00:05:34.330 --> 00:05:37.390
the white sword relishes, and loves the idea of battle.

128
00:05:37.391 --> 00:05:40.210
And doesn't really care much about the people that he's taking out with

129
00:05:40.211 --> 00:05:41.044
Wolverine.

130
00:05:41.170 --> 00:05:44.200
It's a wholly different beast because the people that he's lost in some ways

131
00:05:44.230 --> 00:05:45.940
have actually been a result of his own actions.

132
00:05:45.940 --> 00:05:48.610
Specifically his wife dying this son of Daikin, right?

133
00:05:48.611 --> 00:05:51.490
She died partially because of Wolverine's actions himself, right.

134
00:05:51.491 --> 00:05:53.530
He kind of led to that situation, taking place,

135
00:05:53.620 --> 00:05:56.170
the people that saber-tooth killed over the course of his life,

136
00:05:56.200 --> 00:05:59.240
like his actions inevitably seem to lead to that. And so, because of that,

137
00:05:59.241 --> 00:06:00.830
like he, you know, a lot of the, the losses,

138
00:06:00.831 --> 00:06:03.620
he sustained have been a defining part of his character,

139
00:06:03.650 --> 00:06:05.270
but also crushed them at the same time.

140
00:06:05.330 --> 00:06:08.480
And so that's why Wolverine ends up being the first to blink Wolverine loses.

141
00:06:08.481 --> 00:06:12.500
So the score now stands a Rocco 15 cacoa five, right?

142
00:06:12.680 --> 00:06:16.130
They're getting absolutely decimated and things only really seem to get worse.

143
00:06:16.131 --> 00:06:18.680
Right? They have these things called the rock silence of a,

144
00:06:18.681 --> 00:06:22.400
of clever more that nobody that almost no one can really resist their call and

145
00:06:22.401 --> 00:06:24.680
Gorgon goes running up on it. Right. Just gets naked,

146
00:06:24.890 --> 00:06:26.990
starts taking his clothes off. Like, yeah, man, me and the rocks,

147
00:06:27.710 --> 00:06:29.210
we're going to get it on. And then from there,

148
00:06:29.240 --> 00:06:32.660
you ended up switching over to Merlin who presents a challenge to the horseman

149
00:06:32.661 --> 00:06:36.260
war and to captain Britain and says, your challenge is to kill the kit.

150
00:06:36.410 --> 00:06:39.890
That's your task. And like war just immediately goes to kill it. And Brian,

151
00:06:39.891 --> 00:06:41.810
Braddock's like, no, you can't kill that. Kitten.

152
00:06:41.840 --> 00:06:44.750
That bite that in that moment is basically him acquiescing.

153
00:06:44.751 --> 00:06:46.910
It's showing you wouldn't do it quick. Whoah loses. Right?

154
00:06:46.911 --> 00:06:51.110
So a Rocco 17 cook hoe up five, and that's kind of how these things continue.

155
00:06:51.111 --> 00:06:54.110
But then you pick up with storm and you pick up with the horsemen of death.

156
00:06:54.170 --> 00:06:57.200
And the two of them real storm really kind of seems to come to you after having

157
00:06:57.201 --> 00:06:58.940
been intoxicated, right. Having been drunk.

158
00:06:59.030 --> 00:07:01.670
And they brought to the realm of Sevilla, right? Kind of like this,

159
00:07:01.671 --> 00:07:04.730
this realm of vampires and so on. And the contest is again,

160
00:07:04.820 --> 00:07:07.640
basically a fight to the death. And we're storm initially says, no,

161
00:07:07.641 --> 00:07:09.890
we need to postpone this because something's wrong with me,

162
00:07:09.891 --> 00:07:12.590
whatever it was that I had at that bar of a, of Jim Jasper's,

163
00:07:12.740 --> 00:07:15.710
I'm effectively drunk. Now the response of death is, I mean, no, but I mean,

164
00:07:15.711 --> 00:07:17.900
you can, but if you do, then you'll have to forfeit.

165
00:07:17.990 --> 00:07:20.720
And that's when she realizes he intentionally did this to her, right.

166
00:07:20.721 --> 00:07:22.160
He got her drunk sacker power.

167
00:07:22.220 --> 00:07:25.160
And now like she's going to have to fight in traditional hand-to-hand combat.

168
00:07:25.190 --> 00:07:27.890
The thing about this though is storm is no Slack.

169
00:07:27.920 --> 00:07:30.770
And she's also one of the best fighters and Marvel, not the best,

170
00:07:30.771 --> 00:07:33.680
best where she's not like in the top five or probably even the top 10,

171
00:07:33.740 --> 00:07:36.620
but she's a really, really, really good fighter and able to hold her own.

172
00:07:36.740 --> 00:07:39.500
And as she's fighting this conflict against, uh, against death,

173
00:07:39.560 --> 00:07:42.860
she gets the upper hand and actually destroys his sword in the process.

174
00:07:42.890 --> 00:07:44.210
And so in response to that,

175
00:07:44.240 --> 00:07:47.720
death removes his helmet and he basically intends to use the death stare.

176
00:07:47.780 --> 00:07:51.080
Now the death stare is basically those individuals who look upon it affectively

177
00:07:51.380 --> 00:07:54.380
died, right? If you, if you glance, if you look at that, look into his face,

178
00:07:54.410 --> 00:07:57.230
his stairwell kill you. Hence the reason why he was given the name death,

179
00:07:57.260 --> 00:08:01.250
but he's not immune to his own powers. He's just highly resistant to them.

180
00:08:01.310 --> 00:08:01.791
And this is,

181
00:08:01.791 --> 00:08:04.820
this comes in the form that when he admits the death stare and that kind of

182
00:08:04.821 --> 00:08:07.040
substance comes out and intends to kill storm,

183
00:08:07.070 --> 00:08:10.820
she reflects it back out and using her sword because her sword is pristine and

184
00:08:10.821 --> 00:08:11.780
it's basically a mirror.

185
00:08:11.840 --> 00:08:14.360
And so it basically kind of incapacitates him for a moment.

186
00:08:14.390 --> 00:08:17.330
She punches a sword through his chest and kills a horseman of death.

187
00:08:17.360 --> 00:08:20.120
This of course leads to all the vampires, basically tearing them apart.

188
00:08:20.180 --> 00:08:22.940
And the point goes to Coca-Cola. So at this point right now,

189
00:08:22.941 --> 00:08:24.590
because the storm may manage to bounce back,

190
00:08:24.620 --> 00:08:28.100
but they're still losing terribly right now. The score is 17.

191
00:08:28.130 --> 00:08:30.020
A Rocco six took her COA,

192
00:08:30.110 --> 00:08:34.430
no earthly clue how in the world they could possibly make that up.

193
00:08:34.670 --> 00:08:36.500
That being said, guys, we're going to bring this video to an end.

194
00:08:36.560 --> 00:08:37.790
