What's going on guys. This is.

5
00:00:12.470 --> 00:00:16.430
<v 1>Rob and we are back again with another installment of our beyond Omega level</v>

6
00:00:16.431 --> 00:00:19.790
series, where we discuss the most powerful characters in comics.

7
00:00:19.940 --> 00:00:23.540
And today we're doing one of the most mysterious and powerful characters of the

8
00:00:23.541 --> 00:00:26.630
DC universe and the character that several of you guys have been requesting in

9
00:00:26.631 --> 00:00:29.120
the comments for awhile, the Phantom stranger.

10
00:00:29.180 --> 00:00:32.510
So the Phantom stranger was created by John broom and Carmen in Pitino,

11
00:00:32.570 --> 00:00:35.720
and first appeared and Phantom stranger. Number one in 1952.

12
00:00:35.780 --> 00:00:38.780
And when I say that the Phantom stranger is a mysterious character.

13
00:00:38.870 --> 00:00:43.490
I mean that for many years we knew absolutely nothing about his origin or his

14
00:00:43.491 --> 00:00:47.570
true identity. It was not until 1987 when DC published secret origins,

15
00:00:47.571 --> 00:00:48.200
number 10,

16
00:00:48.200 --> 00:00:52.130
that we got any insight whatsoever to who the Phantom stranger really was.

17
00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:55.880
And even then we didn't exactly get a great deal of clarity as the issue

18
00:00:55.881 --> 00:00:59.870
presented us with four conflicting yet equally possible versions of his origin

19
00:00:59.871 --> 00:01:00.430
story.

20
00:01:00.430 --> 00:01:03.350
And so the first of these possible origins was adapted from a legend that dates

21
00:01:03.351 --> 00:01:05.030
back to the 13th century in Europe,

22
00:01:05.060 --> 00:01:08.720
and is commonly referred to as the wondering Jew. Now, as the legend goes,

23
00:01:08.750 --> 00:01:10.460
this was a man of Jewish heritage,

24
00:01:10.490 --> 00:01:14.270
the Tawny Christ on his way to his crucifixion and as punishment was cursed to

25
00:01:14.271 --> 00:01:18.020
walk the earth until price return. Now in the version told in secret origin,

26
00:01:18.021 --> 00:01:18.590
number 10,

27
00:01:18.590 --> 00:01:22.760
the Phantom stranger confesses to a priest that he was once a man named Isaac

28
00:01:22.790 --> 00:01:25.580
who lived in Bethlehem during the time of Christ's birth.

29
00:01:25.610 --> 00:01:29.570
Now Herod the King of Judea gives an order to kill every male child in the

30
00:01:29.571 --> 00:01:31.490
region in an effort to kill Christ,

31
00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:33.770
who he views as a potential threat to his throne.

32
00:01:33.860 --> 00:01:37.310
And in the massacre Isaac's wife, Rebecca and his son are killed.

33
00:01:37.430 --> 00:01:41.500
And so Isaac holds a grudge against price for the next 30 years and even bribes

34
00:01:41.501 --> 00:01:45.110
a Roman soldier to allow him to participate in the beating of Jesus prior to the

35
00:01:45.111 --> 00:01:48.890
crucifixion, but in the middle of this torture Christ turns to Isaac and says,

36
00:01:48.980 --> 00:01:50.120
I go on my rest,

37
00:01:50.150 --> 00:01:54.650
but you shall wonder without rest you shelter Harry in this world till the day I

38
00:01:54.651 --> 00:01:58.010
come again. And so Isaac finds himself unable to return home,

39
00:01:58.070 --> 00:02:00.740
but is driven by a constant compulsion to wonder the earth.

40
00:02:00.770 --> 00:02:04.130
He roams the earth for centuries until he witnesses a woman being attacked by

41
00:02:04.131 --> 00:02:06.230
inquisitors during the Spanish inquisition.

42
00:02:06.320 --> 00:02:09.920
And so we see that the woman is identical to his wife and tries to save her,

43
00:02:09.950 --> 00:02:12.230
but to no avail as she dies in his arms,

44
00:02:12.260 --> 00:02:15.920
but her refusal to blame God for her death led the stranger to decide to repent

45
00:02:15.921 --> 00:02:19.130
of a sense and begin serving God as the Phantom stranger.

46
00:02:19.220 --> 00:02:21.170
And so upon hearing his confession to the priest,

47
00:02:21.200 --> 00:02:22.790
God offers the Phantom stranger,

48
00:02:22.791 --> 00:02:26.120
a release from his punishment where the stranger turns him down saying that

49
00:02:26.121 --> 00:02:28.700
there's more darkness in the world that needs to be dispelled.

50
00:02:28.790 --> 00:02:32.360
And so the second version of the Phantom stranger's origin that we're told is

51
00:02:32.361 --> 00:02:34.310
also biblical in nature this time,

52
00:02:34.400 --> 00:02:38.150
he was a man living in a city that had been condemned to be destroyed by God

53
00:02:38.270 --> 00:02:41.180
because of its wickedness. However, because of his righteousness,

54
00:02:41.240 --> 00:02:44.780
the man who would become the Phantom stranger was visited by an angel who told

55
00:02:44.781 --> 00:02:47.570
him that because he was the only good person in the city.

56
00:02:47.630 --> 00:02:49.010
His life would be spared,

57
00:02:49.040 --> 00:02:51.740
but not wanting to see his family and his fellow citizens perish.

58
00:02:51.760 --> 00:02:52.490
While he lived,

59
00:02:52.490 --> 00:02:56.000
the man refused the angels mercy and punches a knife into his stomach,

60
00:02:56.030 --> 00:02:57.170
so that he'll die with him.

61
00:02:57.290 --> 00:03:01.330
And so the angel forces his soul back into his body and erases all his memories

62
00:03:01.331 --> 00:03:05.050
of his past life while sentencing him to wonder the earth turning souls from

63
00:03:05.080 --> 00:03:08.170
evil to good until there were none left in need of redemption.

64
00:03:08.260 --> 00:03:12.340
Now the third version of his origin story involves a group of scientists seeking

65
00:03:12.341 --> 00:03:15.910
to prolong the end of the universe by transferring energy from the big bang to

66
00:03:15.911 --> 00:03:18.160
the end of the universe via time-travel as well.

67
00:03:18.160 --> 00:03:21.280
The Phantom stranger shows up to tell them that what they're doing will have

68
00:03:21.281 --> 00:03:22.780
catastrophic consequences.

69
00:03:22.810 --> 00:03:26.530
One of the scientists who turns out to be an avatar of anti-life attacks the

70
00:03:26.531 --> 00:03:30.190
Phantom stranger and carries on with a secret plan to end the universe by

71
00:03:30.191 --> 00:03:31.600
draining the energy of the big bang,

72
00:03:31.720 --> 00:03:35.230
thereby causing the universe to simply cease to exist the Phantom stranger,

73
00:03:35.231 --> 00:03:35.680
however,

74
00:03:35.680 --> 00:03:39.280
near the end of his life transfers his essence and power to another one of the

75
00:03:39.281 --> 00:03:42.190
scientists who remarks that he now has unlimited power.

76
00:03:42.220 --> 00:03:45.790
He then absorbs the energy of the end of the universe and redistributes it,

77
00:03:45.840 --> 00:03:49.360
creating a new universe where he will serve as the Phantom stranger with the

78
00:03:49.361 --> 00:03:53.080
impression being that this cycle will be repeated with every rebirth of

79
00:03:53.081 --> 00:03:55.060
subsequent universes. And so finally,

80
00:03:55.120 --> 00:03:58.270
we have another origin story rooted in biblical tradition,

81
00:03:58.330 --> 00:04:01.120
this one being written by Alan Moore. Now when this version,

82
00:04:01.150 --> 00:04:03.370
the Phantom stranger begins as an angel,

83
00:04:03.550 --> 00:04:07.030
who's approached by an angel named ed trigon seeking to recruit him to Satan's

84
00:04:07.031 --> 00:04:10.000
rebellion against Yahweh, which is the Hebrew name for God.

85
00:04:10.060 --> 00:04:13.540
He refuses to take aside, which ends up getting him cast out of heaven.

86
00:04:13.630 --> 00:04:15.280
But instead of being banished to hell,

87
00:04:15.310 --> 00:04:18.760
he's doomed to walk the earth forever as the Phantom stranger. Now,

88
00:04:18.761 --> 00:04:22.980
while all these origins all presented originally without any context as to which

89
00:04:22.981 --> 00:04:23.790
one is true,

90
00:04:23.790 --> 00:04:27.780
the fallen angel story was seemingly corroborated by John Constantine and the

91
00:04:27.781 --> 00:04:31.530
trench coat brigade mini series published by vertigo in 1999.

92
00:04:31.590 --> 00:04:33.960
This origin was rec count. However, in the new fifties,

93
00:04:34.110 --> 00:04:35.730
you continuity with 2012,

94
00:04:35.760 --> 00:04:39.540
the Phantom stranger number zero written by Dan to dial now in this version,

95
00:04:39.570 --> 00:04:43.230
the Phantom stranger is Judas Iscariot, the disciple of Jesus,

96
00:04:43.530 --> 00:04:47.580
the betrayed him to the Jewish high priest and exchange for 30 pieces of silver

97
00:04:47.700 --> 00:04:50.370
and so ashamed of what he'd done, Judas killed himself,

98
00:04:50.400 --> 00:04:54.150
but it's taken to a room where he's judged by a council of divine beings as one

99
00:04:54.151 --> 00:04:58.470
of the three greatest transgressors in the history of mankind judge and returned

100
00:04:58.471 --> 00:05:02.070
to his body in the field where he betrayed Jesus with the coins he received now

101
00:05:02.100 --> 00:05:03.090
bound to a skin.

102
00:05:03.180 --> 00:05:07.110
And so a voice from the sky tells Judas to put on a robe that it appeared beside

103
00:05:07.111 --> 00:05:10.860
him, which was revealed to have belong to Jesus before he was crucified.

104
00:05:10.920 --> 00:05:15.120
And so Judas dawns the rope and is informed that his penance for sin is to walk

105
00:05:15.121 --> 00:05:16.830
the earth until his debt was paid,

106
00:05:16.920 --> 00:05:19.440
where upon he would become an agent for the greater good.

107
00:05:19.590 --> 00:05:21.780
And so we wonder is the earth for thousands of years,

108
00:05:21.840 --> 00:05:24.960
until the voice commands him to seek out a detective named John Corrigan,

109
00:05:25.020 --> 00:05:28.860
who's arguing with his boss over a missing persons case involving his fiance

110
00:05:29.190 --> 00:05:31.590
twin. Now Corgan quits and storms out of the office,

111
00:05:31.620 --> 00:05:34.650
but as approached by the Phantom stranger, who offers to take him to where,

112
00:05:34.680 --> 00:05:37.020
when as being held, unbeknownst to the stranger,

113
00:05:37.080 --> 00:05:39.690
he's leading Corgan into a trap and he's killed,

114
00:05:39.870 --> 00:05:42.360
which releases the divine entity known as the specter,

115
00:05:42.420 --> 00:05:44.130
the embodiment of divine vengeance,

116
00:05:44.160 --> 00:05:47.430
who immediately recognizes the Phantom stranger as the one who betrayed him

117
00:05:47.431 --> 00:05:47.940
before.

118
00:05:47.940 --> 00:05:51.600
And so ushering in the transformation of Corgan into the specter causes one of

119
00:05:51.601 --> 00:05:55.350
the coins to fall from the Phantom strangers signaling that he's a step closer

120
00:05:55.351 --> 00:05:57.090
to paying off the debt for a sense.

121
00:05:57.170 --> 00:05:59.600
And so with all those different potential origins out of the way,

122
00:05:59.660 --> 00:06:02.750
let's get into the Phantom strangers Howers first of all,

123
00:06:02.780 --> 00:06:07.430
he is immortal and immune to the effects of aging or disease. He possesses vast,

124
00:06:07.431 --> 00:06:10.100
magical abilities. The upper limits of which are not known.

125
00:06:10.160 --> 00:06:12.830
He can travel between dimensions as well as through time.

126
00:06:12.920 --> 00:06:17.330
I can wield mythical energy offensively in the form of glass or defensively to

127
00:06:17.331 --> 00:06:20.690
ward off virtually any spell cats by any other magic user.

128
00:06:20.840 --> 00:06:22.700
Although he is extraordinarily powerful,

129
00:06:22.760 --> 00:06:25.790
he's frequently prohibited from intervening directly in events.

130
00:06:25.880 --> 00:06:28.910
And so we have to observe and influence others from the sidelines.

131
00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:31.460
The Phantom strangers seems to be nearly on mission,

132
00:06:31.520 --> 00:06:33.530
knowing basically everything that is knowable,

133
00:06:33.590 --> 00:06:37.190
except apparently that he was leading Jim Corgan to his death is that did

134
00:06:37.191 --> 00:06:38.540
obviously taken by surprise.

135
00:06:38.600 --> 00:06:41.510
But I assume this was hidden from him by a higher power that needed the events

136
00:06:41.511 --> 00:06:43.190
to come to pass like BC's riders.

137
00:06:43.220 --> 00:06:46.250
And so just to get a sense of how powerful the Phantom stranger is,

138
00:06:46.340 --> 00:06:47.900
he's gone up against the Spector.

139
00:06:47.930 --> 00:06:51.470
Who's one of the most powerful entities in DC comics and has not only held his

140
00:06:51.471 --> 00:06:52.010
own,

141
00:06:52.010 --> 00:06:55.400
but the fight actually had to be stopped by the presence because it was a threat

142
00:06:55.401 --> 00:06:58.550
to the universe. And that's for how powerful has magical abilities art.

143
00:06:58.610 --> 00:07:03.170
He was unaffected by magical energy that it allowed impulse to defeat Mr. Mixel,

144
00:07:03.620 --> 00:07:06.080
Pedalec a powerful reality warping character. Furthermore,

145
00:07:06.110 --> 00:07:10.340
his magical abilities are said to be beyond pacification and he does not rely on

146
00:07:10.341 --> 00:07:11.210
traditional spells,

147
00:07:11.240 --> 00:07:14.480
but is able to harness mystical energy and a more pure fashion.

148
00:07:14.540 --> 00:07:18.380
Basically there is no defined limit as to how powerful the Phantom stranger

149
00:07:18.381 --> 00:07:20.660
could be if he realized his full potential,

150
00:07:20.720 --> 00:07:24.590
but we really get to see him even come close to his full potential because doing

151
00:07:24.591 --> 00:07:27.860
so would resolve most storylines instantaneously.

152
00:07:27.890 --> 00:07:30.950
And so he's usually relegated to being a background advisory character when he

153
00:07:30.951 --> 00:07:34.310
shows up, but on the rare occasions that he does engage in battle,

154
00:07:34.340 --> 00:07:38.480
he's proven himself to be one of the most powerful characters in the entirety of

155
00:07:38.481 --> 00:07:41.810
the DC universe. And that's it. That's all we have.

156
00:07:41.840 --> 00:07:44.060
The Phantom stranger lives up to his namesake.

157
00:07:44.090 --> 00:07:48.310
He's a Phantom whose strange earth and most of the guys that we see out there

158
00:07:48.320 --> 00:07:52.500
using powers, I don't know. That was my terrible attempt at a joke.

159
00:07:52.690 --> 00:07:54.560
That being said, guys, we're gonna bring this video to an end.

160
00:07:54.800 --> 00:07:57.050
