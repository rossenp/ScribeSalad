4
00:00:11.070 --> 00:00:11.720
All right, what's going on?

5
00:00:11.720 --> 00:00:16.700
<v 1>Hey guys, this is Rob and, uh, we are back with venom beyond. Here's the thing,</v>

6
00:00:16.701 --> 00:00:19.790
man. I, I love the way that Dani Kates writes this, right?

7
00:00:19.791 --> 00:00:22.550
Because I fired this book up and I say within the span of five minutes I was

8
00:00:22.551 --> 00:00:24.950
done, right. I just ripped through this book. And to me,

9
00:00:24.951 --> 00:00:27.860
that's a Testament of how good a comic book is, right. If I can just like,

10
00:00:27.890 --> 00:00:31.310
if I find myself just ripping through it and I feel like I'm done before I even

11
00:00:31.311 --> 00:00:34.550
started, that's just how good the kind of book is written. Right? So, um,

12
00:00:34.580 --> 00:00:38.180
this kind of gives us at least as much as Donnie Cates gives us anyway,

13
00:00:38.240 --> 00:00:41.210
the way in which the world fell under the rule of venom sun.

14
00:00:41.380 --> 00:00:43.970
And we're not given a whole ton of stuff here. And in reality,

15
00:00:43.971 --> 00:00:45.320
we probably don't need to be.

16
00:00:45.350 --> 00:00:48.110
But the idea here is that at some point in the past,

17
00:00:48.111 --> 00:00:51.490
and this alternate reality that there was, you basically had, you know, an,

18
00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:53.780
an weighing who of course was possessed by her venom.

19
00:00:54.350 --> 00:00:56.600
Symbion more or less operating as what amounts to agent venom,

20
00:00:56.630 --> 00:00:59.450
alongside Spiderman, who ended up defeating Dr. Octopus, right?

21
00:00:59.630 --> 00:01:04.220
In some campaign that was called octopi wall street, it was kind of goofy,

22
00:01:04.250 --> 00:01:07.130
but an weighing basically reveals that she's pregnant here.

23
00:01:07.190 --> 00:01:11.810
Now this is what's kind of bonkers is Donnie Cates doesn't necessarily seem to

24
00:01:11.811 --> 00:01:15.500
have given us the indication that Eddie Brock is the one who got her pregnant.

25
00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:18.470
It's just simply that Eddie Brock, you know, was Eddie Brock and her were,

26
00:01:18.471 --> 00:01:21.800
were married at one point in a relationship. If we follow the, you know,

27
00:01:21.801 --> 00:01:23.510
a reasonable timeline here,

28
00:01:23.570 --> 00:01:26.810
we don't definitively know when it was that Eddie Brock shot himself.

29
00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:27.740
We're not told here.

30
00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:30.920
And this particular comic that like three days after Eddie Brock shot himself,

31
00:01:30.921 --> 00:01:32.420
you know, we're not really told that instead.

32
00:01:32.510 --> 00:01:34.820
It's just Eddie Brock ended up killing himself in the bell tower.

33
00:01:34.821 --> 00:01:37.610
And then Ann went there and she ended up getting the venom Symbion right.

34
00:01:37.611 --> 00:01:39.320
So we don't really know how much time has passed.

35
00:01:39.410 --> 00:01:41.570
I would expect that under most circumstances,

36
00:01:41.571 --> 00:01:43.490
whenever a woman realizes she's pregnant issues, they,

37
00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:47.180
because as she goes through her womanly times that she realizes that she's not

38
00:01:47.181 --> 00:01:49.640
doing the things she's supposed to be doing. And as a result of that,

39
00:01:49.670 --> 00:01:53.510
we can largely assume that at most a month has passed since Eddie Brock died by

40
00:01:53.810 --> 00:01:54.830
whatever manner and whatever means,

41
00:01:54.860 --> 00:01:57.290
if we assume that Eddie Brock is the one who got her pregnant,

42
00:01:57.470 --> 00:02:00.980
then that make sense. We could also kind of assume that she was,

43
00:02:01.010 --> 00:02:02.930
that it's like a miraculous conception, right?

44
00:02:02.930 --> 00:02:06.500
That like the Symbian ultimately just ended up creating an offspring inside of

45
00:02:06.501 --> 00:02:08.660
her. Uh, again, we're not giving a definitive answer here.

46
00:02:08.690 --> 00:02:11.150
We just kind of have to swing for the fences because when she's sitting down

47
00:02:11.151 --> 00:02:13.820
with Peter Parker and she tells Peter Parker that she's pregnant,

48
00:02:13.850 --> 00:02:16.130
when he asks who the father is, she's like, I don't know.

49
00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:19.220
Now the third option here is that Anne's just really promiscuous.

50
00:02:19.250 --> 00:02:21.950
And like any number of guys out there could be the dad, right.

51
00:02:21.951 --> 00:02:24.260
We just don't know. Right. It's like an episode of Maury Povich, right?

52
00:02:24.261 --> 00:02:26.540
You bring like 20 guys on there. None of them are the father. Right?

53
00:02:26.570 --> 00:02:29.000
You have no idea which one it is, you know? So that's an,

54
00:02:29.160 --> 00:02:32.600
that's also an option to write, but whatever it is, she ended up being pregnant.

55
00:02:32.601 --> 00:02:34.790
And of course that was Dylan, right? She ended up being, you know,

56
00:02:34.791 --> 00:02:36.230
getting pregnant and having Dylan.

57
00:02:36.260 --> 00:02:38.990
The crazy thing about this as Peter Parker basically talks about, Hey, like,

58
00:02:38.991 --> 00:02:40.520
you know, it was going to be tough, being a single mom.

59
00:02:40.521 --> 00:02:41.420
I was kind of raised there,

60
00:02:41.421 --> 00:02:44.810
but if you ever need any help on here and her response is I'm not a single mom,

61
00:02:45.050 --> 00:02:47.210
right. I have been. Um, and so like between the two of us,

62
00:02:47.211 --> 00:02:50.720
we can raise this kid to become a productive member of society. Right.

63
00:02:50.721 --> 00:02:52.670
We'll just be fun, you know, we'll, we'll be just fun.

64
00:02:52.760 --> 00:02:56.510
And so what you end up finding out here is that as time passed and Dylan grew up

65
00:02:56.540 --> 00:02:59.180
and got to the age that he is now in the main Marvel universe,

66
00:02:59.230 --> 00:03:02.140
that he grew up as any kind of a normal kid does, right.

67
00:03:02.141 --> 00:03:05.110
He had his good moments, his bad moments, right. You know, kids misbehave,

68
00:03:05.111 --> 00:03:07.720
they push Brown, uh, push boundaries, different things like that, you know?

69
00:03:07.720 --> 00:03:09.430
And so he did what any normal kid does,

70
00:03:09.460 --> 00:03:13.120
but then one day she came home and all those different drawings were on the

71
00:03:13.121 --> 00:03:13.871
walls, right? The,

72
00:03:13.871 --> 00:03:17.320
the drawings of like the Grenville and that's kind of the telltale signature of

73
00:03:17.321 --> 00:03:18.730
like NOLA Simeot God.

74
00:03:18.790 --> 00:03:22.510
And so what she basically shows here is that at some point along the line,

75
00:03:22.570 --> 00:03:26.690
that Knoll ended up taking over Dylan. Right now, this I believe is shown in,

76
00:03:26.910 --> 00:03:29.350
in, in a one-shot comic that focuses on Noah,

77
00:03:29.410 --> 00:03:31.200
basically getting his hands on Dylan and,

78
00:03:31.201 --> 00:03:34.330
and influencing him and actually teaching him how to use his powers or at least

79
00:03:34.331 --> 00:03:36.280
teaching them the base on how its powers work.

80
00:03:36.310 --> 00:03:38.230
And then the rest was kind of left to Dylan from there.

81
00:03:38.290 --> 00:03:40.300
But one of the things to keep in mind for those of you guys who are a little

82
00:03:40.301 --> 00:03:43.600
behind here, no, the Symbian God was Donnie Cates, his invention.

83
00:03:43.690 --> 00:03:46.870
And what he basically did is he introduced this idea that where Brian,

84
00:03:46.871 --> 00:03:50.380
Michael Bendis had previously given us this explanation of the symbionts and the

85
00:03:50.381 --> 00:03:52.240
sense that venom was not a one-off right.

86
00:03:52.241 --> 00:03:55.630
The venom actually comes from a planet of symbionts and those symbionts are

87
00:03:55.631 --> 00:03:57.520
ideally space nights, right?

88
00:03:57.521 --> 00:04:00.790
So they basically bond themselves to a host and they go forward as protectors of

89
00:04:00.791 --> 00:04:03.250
the universe that sometimes assembly it can be corrupted.

90
00:04:03.310 --> 00:04:05.470
And that's what happened that in the original secret Wars,

91
00:04:05.500 --> 00:04:08.560
Peter Parker came in contact with assembly and he was supposed to be a space

92
00:04:08.740 --> 00:04:09.371
nine of sorts, right?

93
00:04:09.371 --> 00:04:12.940
Like a protector using a Symbian the result was that once he was told by Reed

94
00:04:12.941 --> 00:04:15.040
Richards in the old web of Spider-Man comics,

95
00:04:15.100 --> 00:04:18.250
that the Simeon was an actual Cynthia being under the things that Peter was

96
00:04:18.251 --> 00:04:22.270
doing were basically because of it was acting in acting of its own a court that

97
00:04:22.271 --> 00:04:25.510
Peter cast it off and in doing so that corrupted the venom Simeon.

98
00:04:25.540 --> 00:04:27.970
And that's how it ended up becoming quote unquote, a bad guy,

99
00:04:28.030 --> 00:04:30.220
and then basically bonded itself to Eddie Brock later on.

100
00:04:30.221 --> 00:04:32.170
And that's the whole history of venom in the, you know,

101
00:04:32.290 --> 00:04:33.340
you're on the main Marvel universe.

102
00:04:33.370 --> 00:04:35.680
The idea was that when Donnie Cates came along,

103
00:04:36.070 --> 00:04:37.630
Donnie Kate said everything that Brian,

104
00:04:37.631 --> 00:04:40.270
Michael Bendis said with the planet of the symbions is still intact,

105
00:04:40.300 --> 00:04:41.440
but I'm adding onto it.

106
00:04:41.441 --> 00:04:45.280
And he created no and no was the person who created the symbionts in the first

107
00:04:45.281 --> 00:04:47.080
place. He created them as basically his henchman.

108
00:04:47.170 --> 00:04:50.740
And that once Knoll was ultimately defeated and kind of cast back into the void,

109
00:04:50.741 --> 00:04:52.810
or at least, you know, kind of locked within his own,

110
00:04:52.840 --> 00:04:54.100
his own planet more or less,

111
00:04:54.101 --> 00:04:57.850
and surrounded by all these symbionts symbionts then in turn became more or less

112
00:04:57.851 --> 00:05:00.700
autonomous. And that's when they formed the idea of becoming protectors,

113
00:05:00.790 --> 00:05:03.010
as opposed to henchman of note with no,

114
00:05:03.011 --> 00:05:05.620
basically re-emerging and the aftermath of a,

115
00:05:05.621 --> 00:05:09.970
of absolute carnage that no began to exercise his control over the symbionts yet

116
00:05:09.971 --> 00:05:10.360
again,

117
00:05:10.360 --> 00:05:13.270
that's really where this comes from in the sense that Knoll basically reached

118
00:05:13.271 --> 00:05:16.210
out from his place within the multi-verse and is influenced this version of

119
00:05:16.211 --> 00:05:18.010
Dylan and basically taking him over right.

120
00:05:18.010 --> 00:05:21.730
In the sense that like Dylan now kind of operates seemingly as an agent of note.

121
00:05:21.790 --> 00:05:25.360
And the result of this is that he ended up taking a piece of his mom's Symbian

122
00:05:25.390 --> 00:05:28.720
and then use it to create his own Sybian following that he ended up taking off

123
00:05:28.721 --> 00:05:30.160
to a different location. And this is,

124
00:05:30.190 --> 00:05:32.500
this is kind of us reading between the lines or at least from what,

125
00:05:32.610 --> 00:05:35.320
what Ann's telling us, that he ended up going to the, basically the bell tower.

126
00:05:35.410 --> 00:05:36.100
And then in turn,

127
00:05:36.100 --> 00:05:39.850
started spawning off all these different symbionts and then controlling them and

128
00:05:39.851 --> 00:05:40.660
then rejecting them.

129
00:05:40.660 --> 00:05:44.170
And this was designed for the purpose of him basically creating symbionts and

130
00:05:44.171 --> 00:05:47.230
then kind of you serving as control over those symbionts and sending them

131
00:05:47.231 --> 00:05:51.280
forward and response to this growing symbiont threat president flash Thompson

132
00:05:51.310 --> 00:05:55.270
ended up creating an weighing and the agent venom force more or less.

133
00:05:55.330 --> 00:05:58.460
And in doing that, the idea was to on the forces of Dillon,

134
00:05:58.490 --> 00:06:02.450
the issue here is that by the time they realized that Dylan was literally a

135
00:06:02.451 --> 00:06:03.230
credible threat,

136
00:06:03.230 --> 00:06:06.110
it was simply too late that with these symbionts he had created,

137
00:06:06.111 --> 00:06:09.620
he had basically forced them onto the superheroes and some of the supervillains

138
00:06:09.650 --> 00:06:11.420
and turn them into a Symbian Hitchman.

139
00:06:11.480 --> 00:06:15.140
And so he literally laid waste to virtually any other superhero and villain that

140
00:06:15.141 --> 00:06:15.830
was left, right.

141
00:06:15.830 --> 00:06:18.800
Killed pretty much all the superheroes and all the supervillains on earth,

142
00:06:18.830 --> 00:06:21.450
following that. And with the death of president flash Thompson,

143
00:06:21.830 --> 00:06:23.570
Dylan essentially made himself a dictator, right.

144
00:06:23.571 --> 00:06:26.990
He made himself absolute ruler of the earth and then sent his symbionts around

145
00:06:26.991 --> 00:06:30.860
the world and started basically taking over everybody around them. Right?

146
00:06:30.861 --> 00:06:32.560
Like the average person. And that's, that's,

147
00:06:32.570 --> 00:06:35.540
that's kind of what Anne says is that Dylan killed the world,

148
00:06:35.600 --> 00:06:38.450
that he essentially conquered the world by using venom symbionts.

149
00:06:38.480 --> 00:06:40.940
And that's why this is just a minimized world. Right? All the heroes,

150
00:06:40.941 --> 00:06:42.560
all the villains are all Cypriots.

151
00:06:42.561 --> 00:06:45.920
Now some of these heroes are actually heroes who have been taken over by

152
00:06:46.430 --> 00:06:49.820
symbionts. Some of these heroes are just venom. Symbionts looking like heroes,

153
00:06:49.850 --> 00:06:52.160
right? Like, you know, kind of appearing as these individuals,

154
00:06:52.190 --> 00:06:53.900
it's kind of a mishmash of these different things.

155
00:06:53.901 --> 00:06:57.650
But the long and short of this is that the concern of Ann is that Dylan could

156
00:06:57.651 --> 00:06:59.300
essentially fall down the same way.

157
00:06:59.390 --> 00:07:00.920
And this comes in a couple of different forms.

158
00:07:00.921 --> 00:07:04.880
The first form this takes is her asking Eddie, does Dylan have these powers?

159
00:07:04.910 --> 00:07:08.750
Now keep in mind, this is a highly emotional situation for Ann, because one,

160
00:07:08.780 --> 00:07:11.630
like she lost her son. She lost her son to the power of Noah.

161
00:07:11.660 --> 00:07:13.460
And there doesn't really seem to be a way to bring him back.

162
00:07:13.490 --> 00:07:17.570
The other part of this is that she is kind of emotionally tied to Eddie Brock.

163
00:07:17.600 --> 00:07:19.070
This is not her Eddie Brock,

164
00:07:19.100 --> 00:07:22.160
but this is in a lot of ways kind of the Eddie she could have had. Right.

165
00:07:22.161 --> 00:07:25.220
And a lot of ways they're a mirror for the life that she lost.

166
00:07:25.430 --> 00:07:26.930
And so that's when she asked the question like,

167
00:07:26.960 --> 00:07:29.930
does your son have that same power? And the responsibility is yes,

168
00:07:29.931 --> 00:07:32.960
he can do that. But he won't, he can't really be taken over by symbionts.

169
00:07:32.990 --> 00:07:34.970
It creates a kind of feedback or feedback loop.

170
00:07:35.000 --> 00:07:37.970
And ultimately it causes him pain. But to, he's not an evil guy,

171
00:07:38.120 --> 00:07:41.660
he's not a bad kid. He's not a villain in the way that your son was.

172
00:07:41.661 --> 00:07:43.910
It sucks to say that, but he's not that way.

173
00:07:43.940 --> 00:07:47.570
Now the issue with this is that Dylan over hears everything, right? Like,

174
00:07:47.571 --> 00:07:50.840
like the, the main Marvel universe, Dylan overhears them all. And for him,

175
00:07:50.841 --> 00:07:51.950
it's kind of crushing, right?

176
00:07:51.951 --> 00:07:55.640
It's crushing to hear that this alternate reality version of himself became such

177
00:07:55.641 --> 00:07:58.310
a horrible person, right. That essentially took over the world.

178
00:07:58.400 --> 00:08:01.790
And that there's a concern that he could become that exact same kind of person,

179
00:08:01.791 --> 00:08:02.060
right?

180
00:08:02.060 --> 00:08:04.850
It's like if you were met with an alternate reality counterpart of yourself who

181
00:08:04.851 --> 00:08:08.030
was just a horrible human being and the concern of everybody that you knew is

182
00:08:08.031 --> 00:08:09.440
that you would become that person, right?

183
00:08:09.441 --> 00:08:11.920
There's a part of you that screams out. I'm not that guy.

184
00:08:11.950 --> 00:08:15.070
I'm not going to be that person, but Dylan has never really met his mom,

185
00:08:15.160 --> 00:08:17.890
but he never really met, met Anne. I mean, she gave birth to him,

186
00:08:17.891 --> 00:08:19.630
but like she ran off to, to, uh,

187
00:08:19.660 --> 00:08:22.810
to Eddie Brock's dad and drop the kid off there when he was a baby and then went

188
00:08:22.811 --> 00:08:26.120
and did herself it right. And so he's never actually met his mom and his,

189
00:08:26.440 --> 00:08:27.850
the woman that he sees, you know, that,

190
00:08:27.851 --> 00:08:29.680
that is the closest he ever came to meeting.

191
00:08:29.681 --> 00:08:31.240
His mom has essentially rejected him.

192
00:08:31.270 --> 00:08:34.570
This is emotionally crushing for really all parties involved here.

193
00:08:34.600 --> 00:08:37.630
The caveat to this is that as they're sitting down and as an cut,

194
00:08:37.720 --> 00:08:39.970
it's kind of says, look, I can't really do this. This is too much.

195
00:08:40.030 --> 00:08:43.300
And as she begins to leave, she's met by venom pool and he's like,

196
00:08:43.510 --> 00:08:45.910
you guys have to go. And it's like, why? And he's like,

197
00:08:45.911 --> 00:08:47.670
because they tracked us here. Like they,

198
00:08:47.800 --> 00:08:50.260
they tracked you guys to your base of operations, right?

199
00:08:50.261 --> 00:08:53.770
Like you guys get out of here as fast as you possibly can because they're

200
00:08:53.771 --> 00:08:56.520
sending someone here to take you. And as soon as she, you know,

201
00:08:56.521 --> 00:09:00.000
as soon as Ann calls in the SOS and suddenly you have score, but you know,

202
00:09:00.001 --> 00:09:00.600
pops in.

203
00:09:00.600 --> 00:09:04.500
And I remember Matt Gargan was operating as virus at the start of the story,

204
00:09:04.560 --> 00:09:04.771
right?

205
00:09:04.771 --> 00:09:08.340
He is been main Marvel universe version of Mac Gargan who has basically been

206
00:09:08.341 --> 00:09:10.830
taken over by a Simeon of source. It was given to him by,

207
00:09:10.970 --> 00:09:14.570
or at least impose on him by up by codex, in order to track it down Eddie,

208
00:09:14.571 --> 00:09:16.580
and then bring him to bring him to Dylan.

209
00:09:16.610 --> 00:09:19.340
And then of course kill everybody else. And the issue with this is like,

210
00:09:19.341 --> 00:09:21.530
as soon as, as they show up all hell breaks loose,

211
00:09:21.590 --> 00:09:26.150
the caveat to this is that Eddie Brock is aware that the weakness of symbionts

212
00:09:26.151 --> 00:09:30.320
comes in the form of like a Sonics or huge amounts of electricity or fire.

213
00:09:30.380 --> 00:09:33.770
And so what he ends up doing is grabbing like these live electric lines just

214
00:09:33.771 --> 00:09:36.650
grabs them and reads like, like those are electrical currents, right?

215
00:09:36.650 --> 00:09:39.710
Like no one can survive. Any of that. Any of that kind of energy,

216
00:09:39.740 --> 00:09:41.630
his response is, yeah, that's what we're counting on.

217
00:09:41.631 --> 00:09:44.300
So he basically channels it through himself and shoots it out. And what it,

218
00:09:44.301 --> 00:09:47.750
what the venoms can be creates is a hand cannon and basically takes out Mac,

219
00:09:47.780 --> 00:09:50.660
right, takes out Mac Gargan. Then he, you, he calls him his son do your thing.

220
00:09:50.690 --> 00:09:52.940
And Dylan seizes, the Symbion off of, uh,

221
00:09:52.970 --> 00:09:55.010
off of scorpion takes total control of it.

222
00:09:55.070 --> 00:09:57.860
And then basically Mack argan reverts back to his normal self, right?

223
00:09:57.920 --> 00:09:59.210
This is a genius maneuver,

224
00:09:59.240 --> 00:10:03.740
but it's also exceedingly dangerous because the more that Dylan uses his powers,

225
00:10:03.770 --> 00:10:05.990
the more susceptible to Knoll he becomes,

226
00:10:06.080 --> 00:10:08.480
and that would allow Knoll to reach in. Now, one thing,

227
00:10:08.481 --> 00:10:09.560
if I'm being honest with you guys,

228
00:10:09.650 --> 00:10:12.620
one thing that I think is really kind of going on here is wouldn't it be

229
00:10:12.621 --> 00:10:16.760
interesting if Donnie Cates followed the Jonathan Hickman Avenger's new Avengers

230
00:10:16.761 --> 00:10:20.000
molecule man concept, right. In the sense that during a vendor's a new Avengers,

231
00:10:20.001 --> 00:10:22.610
most of you guys know there was one molecule man in every reality.

232
00:10:22.670 --> 00:10:24.860
And that origin of molecule man was the exact same,

233
00:10:24.890 --> 00:10:28.010
but he was designed to be a bomb that the Bianers were going to detonate all at

234
00:10:28.011 --> 00:10:29.990
the same time and destroy the multi-verse. Right.

235
00:10:29.991 --> 00:10:32.600
But wouldn't it be interesting if it were the same concept with Dylan,

236
00:10:32.630 --> 00:10:36.650
that every universe has its own version of Dylan and Dylan is unique among,

237
00:10:36.651 --> 00:10:39.290
you know, in, in every single universe in the sense that Wallace origins,

238
00:10:39.291 --> 00:10:43.160
not the exact same, although it, it may be in some way that he has these powers,

239
00:10:43.190 --> 00:10:46.340
the ability to dominate the wills of symbionts, he is an effect,

240
00:10:46.370 --> 00:10:48.440
it kind of indirect air to note, right?

241
00:10:48.441 --> 00:10:50.840
He possesses essence of the same powers that Knoll does,

242
00:10:50.900 --> 00:10:54.500
even if not on such a grandiose scale. And that by having that kind of power,

243
00:10:54.530 --> 00:10:56.660
it allows Knoll to basically take over Dylan,

244
00:10:56.690 --> 00:10:59.120
which allows him to control the SIM Gates across every world.

245
00:10:59.150 --> 00:11:01.730
Wouldn't that be interesting, right? Every world in every universe,

246
00:11:01.760 --> 00:11:03.800
but as far as my garden goes, you know, of course when,

247
00:11:03.801 --> 00:11:07.250
when the symbionts torn off of him and Eddie realizes it's Matt Gargan,

248
00:11:07.400 --> 00:11:09.230
do we kind of get a little bit of explanation here, right?

249
00:11:09.231 --> 00:11:11.810
And the idea is that during absolute carnage, but as you guys remember,

250
00:11:12.110 --> 00:11:13.910
Matt Gargan, his spine was almost totally ripped out.

251
00:11:13.940 --> 00:11:18.290
And he was basically paralyzed and Eddie left him there and Eddie just left him

252
00:11:18.291 --> 00:11:21.530
there and you got to go by Leo. He ended up taking off and leaving him there.

253
00:11:21.560 --> 00:11:24.320
And that's why Matt Gargan holds so much animosity because he's like,

254
00:11:24.350 --> 00:11:25.210
you don't forget,

255
00:11:25.220 --> 00:11:28.460
like you don't get to just walk away from the fact that you left me paralyzed

256
00:11:28.461 --> 00:11:28.820
like that.

257
00:11:28.820 --> 00:11:32.720
Now admittedly not guardian was going to let like an innocent kid die. Right.

258
00:11:32.721 --> 00:11:34.520
So, you know, at the end of the day, Eddie Brock's like,

259
00:11:34.580 --> 00:11:35.780
I was kind of right for what I did.

260
00:11:35.810 --> 00:11:38.450
But the response of Mac is you basically left me there.

261
00:11:38.451 --> 00:11:41.600
That way I could have recovered if I'd had a symbiont or something like that,

262
00:11:41.630 --> 00:11:45.140
but I couldn't write, like you just left me paralyzed there and walked away.

263
00:11:45.230 --> 00:11:47.090
And so the response of Eddie and this is really interesting.

264
00:11:47.120 --> 00:11:49.370
The response with Eddie is fine. Then we'll make you a deal,

265
00:11:49.490 --> 00:11:52.700
but I'm going to make you a deal here. My son just killed the Symbian.

266
00:11:52.730 --> 00:11:54.640
That was to you from codex. Right?

267
00:11:54.670 --> 00:11:58.180
So what we're going to do is you're going to take us to codex and then seemingly

268
00:11:58.181 --> 00:12:01.000
the bargain is, you know, I will give you a symbiont or something like that.

269
00:12:01.000 --> 00:12:02.510
And you'll regain your ability to walk. I,

270
00:12:02.520 --> 00:12:03.820
I don't really know what the bargain is,

271
00:12:03.821 --> 00:12:06.940
but the idea is you are going to take us to codex and as will,

272
00:12:06.941 --> 00:12:11.020
seemingly Dylan is going to meet his alternate reality counterpart and who even

273
00:12:11.021 --> 00:12:13.060
knows what's going to come out of that conflict.

274
00:12:13.090 --> 00:12:16.780
I have no earthly clue because maybe we'll get even more of an origin story

275
00:12:16.840 --> 00:12:19.030
about codex, right. And that's why I was kind of tentative here.

276
00:12:19.060 --> 00:12:21.790
Maybe we'll get a lot more information because we still got two issues.

277
00:12:21.791 --> 00:12:24.220
I think until this whole thing is done. So that being said, guys,

278
00:12:24.280 --> 00:12:26.650
we're gonna bring this video to an end. If you are new here to comments,

279
