4
00:00:11.040 --> 00:00:11.690
Okay. So.

5
00:00:11.690 --> 00:00:15.380
<v 1>We are picking back up again with the conclusion of the Maestro Hawk story,</v>

6
00:00:15.410 --> 00:00:15.561
right.

7
00:00:15.561 --> 00:00:18.130
I kind of wanted to wait until this was done before we wrapped it all up because

8
00:00:18.260 --> 00:00:19.610
it'd been going pretty slow. Right.

9
00:00:19.611 --> 00:00:21.980
And what we kind of found was that over the course of the individual issues,

10
00:00:22.070 --> 00:00:23.240
there wasn't really a whole lot happening.

11
00:00:23.270 --> 00:00:24.710
So I figured we'd go ahead and wait till it ended.

12
00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:26.540
And then just kind of covered all in one go. Right?

13
00:00:26.541 --> 00:00:27.920
So in the last video that we did,

14
00:00:27.921 --> 00:00:29.390
if those of you guys who were playing catch up here,

15
00:00:29.600 --> 00:00:30.710
and the last video that we did,

16
00:00:30.711 --> 00:00:34.010
the Maestro whole had shown up to dystopia only to find out that it was being

17
00:00:34.011 --> 00:00:35.390
ruled by Hercules.

18
00:00:35.450 --> 00:00:38.840
Now this version of Hercules is not the one that we're used to what her Hercules

19
00:00:38.960 --> 00:00:40.700
and Marvel comedies really in recent years,

20
00:00:40.701 --> 00:00:42.200
I would say more so than in the old years,

21
00:00:42.201 --> 00:00:46.370
but in more recent years has largely been depicted as a kind of jovial guy that

22
00:00:46.371 --> 00:00:48.860
the superhero community doesn't really seem to take seriously,

23
00:00:48.890 --> 00:00:51.380
which is ironic because he's wildly powerful,

24
00:00:51.410 --> 00:00:55.370
but in the aftermath of nuclear war and the biochemical weapons that were used

25
00:00:55.371 --> 00:00:57.920
by cipher to kind of eliminate what was left of humanity,

26
00:00:57.980 --> 00:01:01.130
that what we kind of realized when we already knew is that a lot,

27
00:01:01.190 --> 00:01:05.540
a large portion of civilization in the United States had been consolidated in

28
00:01:05.541 --> 00:01:08.540
dystopia, which was formerly New York under the rule of Hercules.

29
00:01:08.780 --> 00:01:12.020
And so for the most part, he doesn't really care about any of his subjects.

30
00:01:12.021 --> 00:01:15.560
And we'll talk about that here in a minute. Instead when he encounters Maestro,

31
00:01:15.561 --> 00:01:17.870
he's just like, he's excited to see it and he's happy to see him.

32
00:01:18.050 --> 00:01:21.440
And then he'd basically the reason for this is because Hercules just misses

33
00:01:21.441 --> 00:01:24.800
fighting people. And so literally a fight breaks out between these two. Now,

34
00:01:24.860 --> 00:01:26.750
one thing to understand about Maestro Hawk,

35
00:01:26.751 --> 00:01:27.950
and this is one of the big differences.

36
00:01:27.951 --> 00:01:31.070
And one of the reasons why when you consider all the different variations of the

37
00:01:31.071 --> 00:01:32.270
incredible health that are out there,

38
00:01:32.300 --> 00:01:35.570
that Maestro is actually one of the weakest is because of the fact that Maestro

39
00:01:35.571 --> 00:01:37.730
does not have the ability to get infinitely strong.

40
00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:40.850
It's one of these things where Marvel kind of created an artificial cutoff that,

41
00:01:40.910 --> 00:01:41.181
you know,

42
00:01:41.181 --> 00:01:44.420
the strength of the level of strength he has now that's as strong as he will

43
00:01:44.421 --> 00:01:47.150
ever be, but you'll never really be stronger than this. I mean, I guess,

44
00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:49.730
you know, his exposure to radiation kind of enhances his strength,

45
00:01:49.760 --> 00:01:52.460
but he doesn't really have the traditional incredible Hulk ability,

46
00:01:52.461 --> 00:01:55.790
which is to become stronger, the angrier he gets instead, you know,

47
00:01:55.791 --> 00:01:58.340
because of the fact that he seems a lot more cunning because he doesn't really

48
00:01:58.341 --> 00:02:02.030
allow himself to be subjected to his own wrath and become almost animalistic in

49
00:02:02.031 --> 00:02:05.750
nature that his intelligence is essentially his weakness here in some ways.

50
00:02:05.780 --> 00:02:09.320
But the fight between him and Hercules, you know, initially is pretty fast,

51
00:02:09.321 --> 00:02:11.180
right? He's able to put up a pretty decent fight,

52
00:02:11.240 --> 00:02:13.760
but Hercules is able to overcome them quite quickly. And in fact,

53
00:02:13.761 --> 00:02:16.400
humble him into the ground where he falls into a sewer system. Now,

54
00:02:16.401 --> 00:02:18.800
at that point, he's met by a person called, uh,

55
00:02:18.830 --> 00:02:22.150
called the court and somebody called pivots, which is basically just they're,

56
00:02:22.160 --> 00:02:24.340
they're essentially like Rick Jones people, you know, the,

57
00:02:24.341 --> 00:02:27.560
the idea of like this rebel group kind of going on and trying to work against,

58
00:02:27.710 --> 00:02:27.730
uh,

59
00:02:27.730 --> 00:02:30.680
Hercules or the very least trying to make life better for people in dystopia.

60
00:02:30.800 --> 00:02:34.040
But what the, with my show kind of vanishing Hercules just kind of walks away,

61
00:02:34.070 --> 00:02:37.280
right. And just, and just leaves it a day. But when the, when Maestro seeds,

62
00:02:37.281 --> 00:02:39.380
Rick Jones, he greets him as an old friend. He's like,

63
00:02:39.381 --> 00:02:40.970
I haven't seen him in a long time because river,

64
00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:42.590
they were exceedingly good friends. Now,

65
00:02:42.591 --> 00:02:46.460
the funny thing about this is that Rick Jones has all kinds of these different

66
00:02:46.461 --> 00:02:49.370
objects and these different artifacts from superheroes that have long since

67
00:02:49.371 --> 00:02:51.590
passed away. Right? So he's got the belt of the century,

68
00:02:51.620 --> 00:02:54.740
he's got the skeleton of Wolverine, he's got the helmet of Magneto.

69
00:02:54.770 --> 00:02:56.250
He's got all these little things here and there,

70
00:02:56.390 --> 00:02:59.830
but all these little trinkets and so on and so forth that he can use for his own

71
00:02:59.831 --> 00:03:00.101
ends,

72
00:03:00.101 --> 00:03:03.670
or just kind of keep them as trophies and remembrances of heroes who used to be.

73
00:03:03.760 --> 00:03:04.870
But one of the things that happens,

74
00:03:04.871 --> 00:03:08.590
there's this kind of discussion between Rick Jones and my Maestro where Rick

75
00:03:08.591 --> 00:03:10.150
Jones really kind of tells them, like,

76
00:03:10.180 --> 00:03:13.180
it's your job to basically do something to save this right? Because you know,

77
00:03:13.181 --> 00:03:15.480
all the people out there, like they're ordinary people that,

78
00:03:15.481 --> 00:03:17.140
that Hercules doesn't really care about that.

79
00:03:17.170 --> 00:03:19.690
But my show doesn't really care about the ordinary people either.

80
00:03:19.691 --> 00:03:22.810
And the reason behind this is because ordinary people were the ones who killed

81
00:03:22.811 --> 00:03:24.550
the world, right? It was not some great, big,

82
00:03:24.551 --> 00:03:27.670
huge conflict between the superheroes and the supervillains that laid waste to

83
00:03:27.671 --> 00:03:28.810
the planet or anything like that.

84
00:03:28.840 --> 00:03:31.660
It was ordinary people who engage themselves in nuclear war, right.

85
00:03:31.661 --> 00:03:34.000
It was the world's the world leaders and all that kind of stuff.

86
00:03:34.090 --> 00:03:36.280
And it's one of these things where you can kind of extrapolate and draw

87
00:03:36.281 --> 00:03:37.390
conclusions from this, right?

88
00:03:37.540 --> 00:03:40.900
If world leaders had kind of moved in the direction to where they were going to

89
00:03:40.901 --> 00:03:43.360
engage in nuclear war, it's not something that happens overnight.

90
00:03:43.390 --> 00:03:44.830
It's something that takes time to happen.

91
00:03:44.860 --> 00:03:48.100
And if people never did anything to stop that by voting people out or something

92
00:03:48.101 --> 00:03:51.190
like that, then it means the average person was effectively okay with it, right.

93
00:03:51.191 --> 00:03:55.060
Their apathy and their inaction denoted, acceptance of the situation. And so,

94
00:03:55.061 --> 00:03:57.850
because of that, you know, it's kind of a, an assumption on our part. But the,

95
00:03:57.860 --> 00:04:01.480
the important thing here is that the world collapsed because of ordinary people.

96
00:04:01.540 --> 00:04:04.720
And that's why my show hope doesn't really care at least seems like he doesn't

97
00:04:04.721 --> 00:04:05.140
really care.

98
00:04:05.140 --> 00:04:07.660
The funny thing about this is Rick Jones calls his bluff and he's like,

99
00:04:07.661 --> 00:04:07.871
you know,

100
00:04:07.871 --> 00:04:10.660
Betty Ross was one of those ordinary people that you talk about that you don't

101
00:04:10.661 --> 00:04:12.100
really care about. Betty Ross was one of those.

102
00:04:12.101 --> 00:04:14.560
And so were you once upon a time, I don't know what happened to you.

103
00:04:14.561 --> 00:04:16.780
I don't know what led you to lead you down this path.

104
00:04:16.840 --> 00:04:19.570
But the Bruce banner that I remember would have done something about this,

105
00:04:19.571 --> 00:04:22.390
right? He would have toppled on Hercules and tried to make the world better.

106
00:04:22.450 --> 00:04:26.140
The result of this is that banner and really like Maestro really, you know,

107
00:04:26.150 --> 00:04:29.680
kind of give off this indication that they really do intend to fix things.

108
00:04:29.681 --> 00:04:31.510
And this, once they traveled to Alcom max, right,

109
00:04:31.511 --> 00:04:34.330
which is historically this really nefarious company that exists out there,

110
00:04:34.331 --> 00:04:36.670
but studies a lot of my genetics and different things like that.

111
00:04:36.700 --> 00:04:39.670
But my show basically stumbled across this room where there's all these

112
00:04:39.671 --> 00:04:42.790
individual people who are basically being held in these status units.

113
00:04:42.970 --> 00:04:44.620
And so over the course of the next few months,

114
00:04:44.621 --> 00:04:47.350
we don't really know exactly what he's doing essentially a few months just

115
00:04:47.351 --> 00:04:51.160
passes, but then word reaches the ears of Hercules that Maestro Hoke is back.

116
00:04:51.160 --> 00:04:52.570
And he's currently in the town square.

117
00:04:52.600 --> 00:04:56.380
And what he's doing here is he's basically rallying all the people around him to

118
00:04:56.500 --> 00:04:56.861
his side,

119
00:04:56.861 --> 00:05:00.150
to make him the new leader now for a man that has such little faith in the,

120
00:05:00.290 --> 00:05:01.810
in the average person and rightfully so,

121
00:05:01.870 --> 00:05:03.520
it's kind of ironic that he would in turn,

122
00:05:03.580 --> 00:05:06.220
look to them to make him their leader. Now, there is a little, there,

123
00:05:06.330 --> 00:05:08.170
there is something else kind of going on behind the scenes here,

124
00:05:08.200 --> 00:05:10.540
but Hercules basically pops up in front of nowhere.

125
00:05:10.541 --> 00:05:13.510
Now around the time that Hercules shows up here that a lot of people are just

126
00:05:13.511 --> 00:05:14.800
kind of like what in the world, right?

127
00:05:14.860 --> 00:05:18.070
And that's when my show presents his dogs of war, right? These giant, you know,

128
00:05:18.080 --> 00:05:21.500
mechanical dogs, essentially that he got from Outbacks, right. That he got from,

129
00:05:21.720 --> 00:05:24.250
from the different resources and things that they were presumably working on.

130
00:05:24.310 --> 00:05:26.350
And then in term PVL where he's kind of telling people like,

131
00:05:26.500 --> 00:05:29.260
we'll make this world better and we'll branch out into the world and become

132
00:05:29.261 --> 00:05:31.150
better. People are just kinda like, you know, forget that.

133
00:05:31.151 --> 00:05:33.370
So humanity's never really learned anything, right?

134
00:05:33.371 --> 00:05:34.660
Like the collapse of civilization,

135
00:05:34.690 --> 00:05:37.420
hasn't really driven anybody to make the world better. If anything,

136
00:05:37.421 --> 00:05:40.210
they just kind of maintained their own selfish tendencies. And so,

137
00:05:40.211 --> 00:05:42.520
because of that, my show is like, fine. If that's how it's going to be.

138
00:05:42.610 --> 00:05:44.920
And that leads to Hercules showing up in Hercules, you know,

139
00:05:44.921 --> 00:05:48.550
when Maestro sets his dogs of war on, on the, all these individual people,

140
00:05:48.730 --> 00:05:50.770
then Hercules shows up and starts kind of saving them.

141
00:05:50.800 --> 00:05:52.480
But not because he really cares about them. Again,

142
00:05:52.510 --> 00:05:55.330
he doesn't really care about that. Only cares about is just, you know,

143
00:05:55.331 --> 00:05:58.670
spending time with the women in his company and like being drunk and fighting.

144
00:05:58.700 --> 00:06:00.200
That's all he really cares about. Right?

145
00:06:00.201 --> 00:06:02.870
The average person here is irrelevant to him. And that's why, you know,

146
00:06:02.871 --> 00:06:06.140
him doing all this isn't necessarily to save people. It's for him to just get,

147
00:06:06.141 --> 00:06:07.970
to get to Maestro and to fight him. Now,

148
00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:10.910
one of the funny things here is that where my show goes to fight Hercules,

149
00:06:10.911 --> 00:06:11.744
he's like, okay, fine.

150
00:06:11.780 --> 00:06:15.080
Then I'm pulling out all the stops and it's still not enough what Hercules

151
00:06:15.110 --> 00:06:17.870
absolutely thrashes my stroke. Just tears them apart.

152
00:06:17.900 --> 00:06:21.170
One of the funny things he does here is he uses the same move on Maestro that

153
00:06:21.380 --> 00:06:22.640
Hoke used on Hercules and a vendor. Right.

154
00:06:22.730 --> 00:06:24.830
We start like smashing them around and then he makes this comment.

155
00:06:24.831 --> 00:06:28.610
He's like puny banner. I laugh. I chuckled at that.

156
00:06:28.611 --> 00:06:31.190
I thought it was pretty funny. He was a, a good little thing to throw in there.

157
00:06:31.250 --> 00:06:34.820
But the idea is that with, with Maestro going full on against Hercules,

158
00:06:34.880 --> 00:06:38.690
he can't beat him. Right. Because Hercules is simply just too strong. And again,

159
00:06:38.750 --> 00:06:41.450
that's the, the, the inherent weakness of the Maestro.

160
00:06:41.510 --> 00:06:44.420
If we were talking about like, just your standard Savage, Hulk,

161
00:06:44.450 --> 00:06:46.370
this that would be over pretty fast,

162
00:06:46.371 --> 00:06:49.010
because hope would just keep getting angrier and angrier and then ultimately

163
00:06:49.011 --> 00:06:51.080
topple and destroy Hercules. But because of that,

164
00:06:51.110 --> 00:06:55.100
Hercules gets the upper hand and absolutely humbles Maestro and then ultimately

165
00:06:55.160 --> 00:06:58.280
forces my show to give up. Right. He just says like surrender before I kill you.

166
00:06:58.340 --> 00:07:00.530
And when the Maestro surrenders Hercules is like, okay,

167
00:07:00.560 --> 00:07:04.220
now this is kind of ironic here because anybody who read future imperfect,

168
00:07:04.280 --> 00:07:07.370
this is the exact same thing Maestro did to the incredible hole or really

169
00:07:07.371 --> 00:07:10.760
professor hall from the modern era when he was pulled into the future by Rick

170
00:07:10.761 --> 00:07:12.920
Jones and all them using Dr. Doom's time platform,

171
00:07:12.980 --> 00:07:15.770
the exact same thing happened. The two engage in a fight, Maestro,

172
00:07:15.771 --> 00:07:18.440
beat the absolute hell out of professor Holt and then said, submitter,

173
00:07:18.441 --> 00:07:20.390
I'll kill you. And professor hoax submitted.

174
00:07:20.610 --> 00:07:23.390
And so the result of this is that Hercules offers to bring Maestro back to a

175
00:07:23.391 --> 00:07:25.490
Citadel. But ultimately my stress has no, right.

176
00:07:25.640 --> 00:07:29.300
Like I'll return when I feel like I am sufficient enough to return.

177
00:07:29.301 --> 00:07:31.670
And do you honor, right. That kind of a thing. So it was kinda like, well,

178
00:07:31.671 --> 00:07:34.160
we'll pick up this fight a different day when I could actually present you with

179
00:07:34.161 --> 00:07:35.510
a challenge, right. That kind of a thing.

180
00:07:35.570 --> 00:07:38.180
And people who are looking at this are like, this is not going to end well,

181
00:07:38.240 --> 00:07:39.680
and it's not right. It really, really,

182
00:07:39.681 --> 00:07:43.250
really is not because what ends up happening here is that you have Maestro who

183
00:07:43.251 --> 00:07:46.940
shows up seemingly a few years later on the doorstep of Hercules.

184
00:07:47.000 --> 00:07:49.100
And he actually brings a woman with him. Right. And he says,

185
00:07:49.101 --> 00:07:51.890
like I brought company now because of the nature of Hercules,

186
00:07:51.891 --> 00:07:53.900
the entirety of dystopia, things like that,

187
00:07:53.960 --> 00:07:57.200
we know that like she'd being brought here by my show to be given to Hercules,

188
00:07:57.201 --> 00:08:00.140
right. For Hercules to do what he will with her. And that's what happens, right?

189
00:08:00.141 --> 00:08:03.170
The servant of Hercules calls them forward. And then basically, you know,

190
00:08:03.230 --> 00:08:06.300
my shoppers in sin with a woman named Anne Darnell and says, Hey, like, I'm,

191
00:08:06.301 --> 00:08:08.720
I'm here to bring you this person. Or I'm here to bring you this, this,

192
00:08:08.750 --> 00:08:12.290
this gift essentially. And she's anxious to make your acquaintance. Right.

193
00:08:12.291 --> 00:08:14.690
You know, if you, if you know what I mean, and Hercules is like, cool, right?

194
00:08:14.691 --> 00:08:16.070
So he basically takes the girl, you know,

195
00:08:16.071 --> 00:08:19.160
into his quarters and the two of them that he kind of closes everything up and

196
00:08:19.161 --> 00:08:21.170
it looks like it's going to turn into naughty time. Well,

197
00:08:21.171 --> 00:08:24.110
what Anne Darnell ends up doing is transforming into vapor.

198
00:08:24.170 --> 00:08:27.620
And the reason why is because she's part of the UFOs. Now, if those guys,

199
00:08:27.710 --> 00:08:29.750
she don't know who the UFOs are, don't worry. They sock.

200
00:08:29.751 --> 00:08:31.280
They're never really that important in the first place.

201
00:08:31.310 --> 00:08:34.580
But the idea behind the UFOs is that they were basically a handful of crazy guys

202
00:08:34.581 --> 00:08:35.990
who wanted to essentially, uh,

203
00:08:36.020 --> 00:08:38.300
get their powers in the same way the fantastic Ford did, right.

204
00:08:38.301 --> 00:08:41.450
They literally re-engineered everything all the way down to like the original

205
00:08:41.810 --> 00:08:44.030
shovel, the whole nine yards vapor was one of those originally,

206
00:08:44.031 --> 00:08:46.400
or not really one of the original, but vapor was a UFO.

207
00:08:46.430 --> 00:08:50.000
And the idea is that she's an individual that has the ability to quite literally

208
00:08:50.030 --> 00:08:52.520
turn into vapor. Now, the way that Marvel plays,

209
00:08:52.521 --> 00:08:55.410
this is that while she had been around for quite some time, the,

210
00:08:55.411 --> 00:08:58.680
what actually ended up going on here is that in the aftermath of the nuclear

211
00:08:58.681 --> 00:09:01.380
war, that, uh, that MODOK, who we saw at the beginning of the story,

212
00:09:01.381 --> 00:09:04.830
basically advanced idea mechanics had essentially rounded up anybody who had

213
00:09:04.831 --> 00:09:08.370
either already been mutated and survived or anybody who had been mutated by

214
00:09:08.371 --> 00:09:11.940
virtue of the nuclear war. And then basically put them in stasis.

215
00:09:11.970 --> 00:09:13.260
And that's what all those pods were.

216
00:09:13.290 --> 00:09:15.840
They were people who had been rounded up by advanced idea mechanics,

217
00:09:15.870 --> 00:09:17.550
who presumably had some kind of plan for them,

218
00:09:17.580 --> 00:09:19.170
which ultimately ended up going belly up.

219
00:09:19.230 --> 00:09:22.380
But because of the fact that she turns into our scene, she ends up killing,

220
00:09:22.470 --> 00:09:24.690
killing Hercules. Now to give you guys perspective here,

221
00:09:24.720 --> 00:09:28.440
our scene is fatally deadly at 250 parts per million.

222
00:09:28.500 --> 00:09:31.890
Now there's not really a consistent like measurement across the board in terms

223
00:09:31.891 --> 00:09:33.480
of like, you know, all you need is a,

224
00:09:33.630 --> 00:09:37.290
is some RC in the size of a golf ball and that's 250 pounds of 250 parts per

225
00:09:37.291 --> 00:09:38.610
million. But suffice it to say here,

226
00:09:38.670 --> 00:09:42.630
I would wager that like maybe enough within her hand or like her finger would be

227
00:09:43.260 --> 00:09:46.500
250 parts per million. So you amplify that out and you basically say that like,

228
00:09:46.530 --> 00:09:51.450
you know what equates to 110 pounds of, of gas effectively,

229
00:09:51.480 --> 00:09:55.050
like, or a hundred of what equates to a massive, 110 pounds of gas,

230
00:09:55.080 --> 00:09:57.750
like floods into the skies, uh, this guy's lungs, right?

231
00:09:57.750 --> 00:10:00.420
He dies with a quickness. It's almost instantaneous, right?

232
00:10:00.421 --> 00:10:03.690
Like it's just so fast. And then my show comes busting in with a freeze rate,

233
00:10:03.720 --> 00:10:06.060
freezes up freezes vapor, and then kills her, right.

234
00:10:06.180 --> 00:10:09.510
And gives a whole purpose behind this. The whole idea was to take out Hercules,

235
00:10:09.570 --> 00:10:11.760
if he couldn't defeat Hercules with sheer strength,

236
00:10:11.790 --> 00:10:15.600
he would defeat Hercules with intelligence. And that is the benefit of Maestro.

237
00:10:15.630 --> 00:10:18.240
What he lacks in strength. He makes up for it with his brain.

238
00:10:18.300 --> 00:10:20.700
And that's how he was able to take out professor hall. Right.

239
00:10:20.730 --> 00:10:23.010
Because he was able to out-think it, he was stronger than him,

240
00:10:23.011 --> 00:10:25.860
but he was also able to out-think him, like he was wildly capable.

241
00:10:26.060 --> 00:10:28.530
And so because of that using his brain and really just the brain of banner is

242
00:10:28.680 --> 00:10:29.520
way what's going on here.

243
00:10:29.580 --> 00:10:32.250
He basically has the body of Hercules taken away for a funeral. Right.

244
00:10:32.251 --> 00:10:33.900
So they literally burned them out of higher. Right.

245
00:10:33.901 --> 00:10:36.990
Just kind of a symbolic gesture saying like the King of old is now gone.

246
00:10:37.050 --> 00:10:38.580
I'm the one who rules the throne now.

247
00:10:38.670 --> 00:10:41.250
And you kind of have this discussion where like, the citizenry are like, well,

248
00:10:41.251 --> 00:10:43.290
maybe we should have some kind of an election. And he was like, okay,

249
00:10:43.291 --> 00:10:45.900
well I nominate myself. If any of you guys have any beef with this,

250
00:10:45.960 --> 00:10:48.990
then you can take it out with my dogs of war and literally sends us dogs of

251
00:10:49.320 --> 00:10:51.870
warrant to attack everybody again. Right. Kind of solidifying, like,

252
00:10:51.900 --> 00:10:54.330
I'm the one who's running the show here. Now at that point,

253
00:10:54.390 --> 00:10:56.970
you end up having the forces of Rick Jones who show back up again.

254
00:10:56.971 --> 00:10:58.230
When Rick Jones realizes the,

255
00:10:58.231 --> 00:11:01.350
my show is going to take over dystopia that he's not going to save the world.

256
00:11:01.380 --> 00:11:04.440
He's going to conquer, what's left of it and rule it just like Hercules dead.

257
00:11:04.470 --> 00:11:07.410
And so what he ends up doing is giving us followers a weapon that was built by

258
00:11:07.411 --> 00:11:09.660
forge for the purpose of killing a Hawk, right.

259
00:11:09.750 --> 00:11:13.140
To like basically atomize an incredible hole. And so when this weapons used,

260
00:11:13.170 --> 00:11:14.700
of course, Maestro smashes the ground,

261
00:11:14.701 --> 00:11:16.470
the weapon goes flying out of the girls' hands and,

262
00:11:16.630 --> 00:11:18.090
and Hercules pops back up again.

263
00:11:18.120 --> 00:11:21.120
And the reason for this is because Hercules basically establishes that he is

264
00:11:21.121 --> 00:11:24.210
actually dead, but in the, in the realm of the afterlife, right?

265
00:11:24.211 --> 00:11:27.690
Whatever you want to call it for Greek mythology in the underworld that Haiti's

266
00:11:27.900 --> 00:11:31.360
had basically granted him a reprieve that Hades allowed his body to come back or

267
00:11:31.361 --> 00:11:34.470
a lot of spirits to reenter his body, to get vengeance on Maestro.

268
00:11:34.530 --> 00:11:37.110
And then when that's done, presumably he would go back to the underworld again.

269
00:11:37.140 --> 00:11:39.420
Right. He wouldn't really go to Olympus. Not really sure why,

270
00:11:39.480 --> 00:11:40.560
but he would basically just, you know,

271
00:11:40.570 --> 00:11:42.840
go back to the underworld and that would essentially be it, uh,

272
00:11:42.870 --> 00:11:45.240
largely it could be assumed because of the fact that, uh,

273
00:11:45.270 --> 00:11:46.980
Hercules has done some pretty shady things.

274
00:11:47.070 --> 00:11:48.990
Because as far as I'm aware of Hercules being parked,

275
00:11:49.290 --> 00:11:51.900
God means he would go to go to Olympus when he dies. Right.

276
00:11:51.901 --> 00:11:53.590
He wouldn't actually go to the underworld.

277
00:11:53.710 --> 00:11:55.900
We're pretty much everybody else goes when they pass on.

278
00:11:56.110 --> 00:11:57.430
But regardless of how you slice it,

279
00:11:57.431 --> 00:12:00.790
him being back here allows him to absolutely pummel the Maestro.

280
00:12:00.820 --> 00:12:03.430
Not only that he's powered by the power of a,

281
00:12:03.850 --> 00:12:07.360
Haiti's now something to understand here. This is not Hercules as ghost writer.

282
00:12:07.390 --> 00:12:10.630
I want to establish that wide off the bat. He's not ghost Hercules.

283
00:12:10.720 --> 00:12:13.300
It'd be cool if he was, well, maybe he kind of is right,

284
00:12:13.301 --> 00:12:14.050
because here's the thing,

285
00:12:14.050 --> 00:12:17.770
the various hell Lords that are out there can do different things with,

286
00:12:18.010 --> 00:12:19.000
with different characters. Right?

287
00:12:19.030 --> 00:12:23.080
For the most part we've only ever really seen manifesto create ghost writers,

288
00:12:23.081 --> 00:12:26.440
never really seen like hella create a ghost writer or like Hades create a ghost

289
00:12:26.441 --> 00:12:27.850
writer. But presumably they could,

290
00:12:27.880 --> 00:12:30.370
because a ghost writer is just a spirit of vengeance and that's what he calls

291
00:12:30.371 --> 00:12:32.800
himself. Right. He's literally, he's like, I'm just a spirit of vengeance,

292
00:12:32.801 --> 00:12:35.800
right? Like I'm back here to get vengeance on you. And then as soon as I'm done,

293
00:12:35.801 --> 00:12:37.780
I'll kind of go back, right. He's currently on fire.

294
00:12:37.810 --> 00:12:41.080
So I guess by all standards of measurement, he essentially is a ghost writer.

295
00:12:41.140 --> 00:12:44.380
Maybe not by that name, particularly, but I mean, I guess he kind of is right.

296
00:12:44.381 --> 00:12:47.620
He's back for vengeance. He's on fire. He's powered by a devil. So yeah,

297
00:12:47.621 --> 00:12:49.990
I guess it kind of falls in the category. So, okay. Ghost writer,

298
00:12:49.991 --> 00:12:51.430
Hercules is basically what this is,

299
00:12:53.200 --> 00:12:55.300
but again much like we saw in the previous,

300
00:12:55.301 --> 00:12:56.980
the previous iterations of previous battles,

301
00:12:57.520 --> 00:12:59.020
Hercules gets the upper hand on my stroke.

302
00:12:59.050 --> 00:13:03.160
The difference here is that this Ray basically fires out of nowhere and ends up

303
00:13:03.161 --> 00:13:06.130
completely atomizing Hercules. Right? And when that happens,

304
00:13:06.131 --> 00:13:08.680
we find out it was the servant of Hercules who had done it,

305
00:13:08.681 --> 00:13:11.410
that he never liked him, right? That this, this servant of Hercules never,

306
00:13:11.411 --> 00:13:13.570
ever really liked him and took him out and destroyed him.

307
00:13:13.600 --> 00:13:15.100
And so with that being the case, you know,

308
00:13:15.101 --> 00:13:18.040
my show basically arms himself with his weapon and then tells Rick Jones he's

309
00:13:18.041 --> 00:13:20.710
going for them. The problem is that when he gets to where Rick Jones is at,

310
00:13:20.740 --> 00:13:22.810
Rick Jones is gone. Now we know he's still alive.

311
00:13:22.840 --> 00:13:25.420
We know that from like future imperfect, basically taken off,

312
00:13:25.421 --> 00:13:26.950
he's kind of gone further underground.

313
00:13:26.980 --> 00:13:30.430
But ultimately what Rick Jones really says by virtue of a message is like,

314
00:13:30.460 --> 00:13:32.950
you've just, you become just as bad as Hercules was like,

315
00:13:32.980 --> 00:13:34.900
you could have made the place better. You could've made it,

316
00:13:34.930 --> 00:13:37.840
made this Topia better. You could have led these people into a better place.

317
00:13:37.870 --> 00:13:39.940
You, you keep talking about how, how, you know,

318
00:13:39.970 --> 00:13:41.830
humanity is a problem and all that kind of stuff,

319
00:13:41.950 --> 00:13:44.380
but you were an ordinary person. You've just chosen to forget.

320
00:13:44.450 --> 00:13:46.120
You've just chosen to forget everything.

321
00:13:46.121 --> 00:13:47.860
Like you've basically become your father,

322
00:13:47.890 --> 00:13:50.380
this abusive old man who tore up his kid and made him, you know,

323
00:13:50.381 --> 00:13:53.380
turned his life inside now. And you are the result of your abusive father.

324
00:13:53.410 --> 00:13:55.270
You've turned into them. You've turned into that. Your man,

325
00:13:55.271 --> 00:13:58.330
you care nothing about other people. You know, you use them for your own whim.

326
00:13:58.360 --> 00:13:59.740
You're just as terrible as they are.

327
00:13:59.770 --> 00:14:03.160
And so this basically leads to a bomb being detonated inside the facility that

328
00:14:03.161 --> 00:14:05.950
was planted by Rick Jones, which of course does not kill my stroke,

329
00:14:05.980 --> 00:14:08.980
but it is kind of a message saying like, we can get to you if we want to.

330
00:14:09.040 --> 00:14:11.640
And so following that, you know, where the, the statements kind to put out,

331
00:14:11.641 --> 00:14:15.300
like, what do we do next? The response of Maestro is I'm officially the new,

332
00:14:15.301 --> 00:14:18.090
you know, now the new ruler of dystopia, I run this whole place.

333
00:14:18.120 --> 00:14:19.350
It is now completely under me.

334
00:14:19.380 --> 00:14:23.190
And this is basically how the incredible Hulk becomes the Maestro.

335
00:14:23.220 --> 00:14:26.790
Having said all of that, the stories, okay. If I'm a betting, man,

336
00:14:26.820 --> 00:14:29.700
I think the reason why we have this here is because we're going to see some

337
00:14:29.701 --> 00:14:32.160
variation of the Maestro in the Marvel cinematic universe,

338
00:14:32.190 --> 00:14:34.680
because it doesn't really make any sense for Marvel to give us this story.

339
00:14:34.950 --> 00:14:36.210
Right. Nobody was asking for it.

340
00:14:36.240 --> 00:14:39.600
It wasn't as though there was a huge amount of interest in the character of my

341
00:14:39.601 --> 00:14:42.720
stroke. Like there was a story that we recently got the last time we saw him.

342
00:14:42.780 --> 00:14:44.250
I think it was an old man, Logan. Right.

343
00:14:44.251 --> 00:14:47.190
And it was like one of the last story arcs before you got dead, man Logan.

344
00:14:47.190 --> 00:14:48.420
Right. So I think it was the old, uh,

345
00:14:48.450 --> 00:14:51.060
I think it was Jeff Lameer and I think maybe, uh,

346
00:14:51.110 --> 00:14:53.570
Mike Dougan was drawing into the title number off the top of my head. Uh,

347
00:14:53.600 --> 00:14:56.870
but it's, it's been a long time since we got the character of Maestro, right?

348
00:14:56.871 --> 00:14:59.210
So it's not like this is something that everybody was asking for.

349
00:14:59.240 --> 00:15:00.530
If I'm being honest with you guys,

350
00:15:00.560 --> 00:15:03.380
I think that's what Bruce banner saw during the events of the age of old Trump,

351
00:15:03.410 --> 00:15:07.040
he saw himself becoming the mice joke, this twisted dark version of himself. Ah,

352
00:15:07.060 --> 00:15:09.380
that was basically ruling a future with an iron fist after,

353
00:15:09.530 --> 00:15:12.110
after succumbs to nuclear war. I think that's what we ended up.

354
00:15:12.230 --> 00:15:13.160
I think that's what he saw.

355
00:15:13.220 --> 00:15:16.070
And I think that's what we're preparing to see in the Marvel cinematic universe.

356
00:15:16.160 --> 00:15:18.170
We might see that somewhere along the line or maybe something different, right.

357
00:15:18.170 --> 00:15:19.730
But we'll probably end up seeing my stroke.

358
00:15:19.760 --> 00:15:21.860
It would be cool if we saw that with like King,

359
00:15:21.861 --> 00:15:23.600
the conquer being the new villain that like,

360
00:15:23.601 --> 00:15:26.390
we kind of get this trip through time and you end up seeing the Maestro in the

361
00:15:26.391 --> 00:15:28.100
future. Uh, no idea if that's the case,

362
00:15:28.280 --> 00:15:29.600
because I'm trying to figure out why in the world,

363
00:15:29.601 --> 00:15:30.830
we got the story in the first place.

364
00:15:30.831 --> 00:15:33.740
And that's the only real conclusion I can get is that when we saw things like

365
00:15:33.741 --> 00:15:37.070
blade versus Wolverine, stuff like that, that has something to do with the MCU.

366
00:15:37.130 --> 00:15:39.680
Right? So with that being said, guys, we're gonna bring this video to an end.

367
00:15:39.710 --> 00:15:42.140
If you are new here to come and explain to make sure you guys have the sub

368
00:15:42.141 --> 00:15:44.360
button to become part of the Rob port. If you guys enjoy this video,

369
00:15:44.390 --> 00:15:47.360
make sure you drop a light and I will catch you all later.
