4
00:00:11.070 --> 00:00:12.290
What's going on guys. This is.

5
00:00:12.650 --> 00:00:14.750
<v 1>Rob and on today's episode of beyond a mega level,</v>

6
00:00:14.780 --> 00:00:18.590
we are going to discuss what may possibly be the most powerful version of the

7
00:00:18.591 --> 00:00:22.190
Hulk that you've never heard of. This is the blue Hawk.

8
00:00:22.220 --> 00:00:25.190
So this version of the whole first appeared and captain universe,

9
00:00:25.191 --> 00:00:29.360
the incredible Hulk number one written by Jay Faber and drawn by Carlos Magno in

10
00:00:29.361 --> 00:00:33.950
2005. Not only is this his first appearance, but it's also his only appearance.

11
00:00:34.100 --> 00:00:36.620
So this is a very short-lived character,

12
00:00:36.650 --> 00:00:41.270
but one that is nonetheless immensely powerful and come on, it's a blue Hawk,

13
00:00:41.271 --> 00:00:42.980
man. So we have to cover it.

14
00:00:43.010 --> 00:00:47.030
So this issue opens with Bruce banner alone in the wilderness with his foot

15
00:00:47.330 --> 00:00:48.110
caught in a bear trap.

16
00:00:48.110 --> 00:00:51.470
Now the pain he feels triggers his transformation into the whole who rips the

17
00:00:51.471 --> 00:00:55.400
bear trap off and is immediately visited by a floating blue orb pet tells the

18
00:00:55.401 --> 00:00:58.820
whole, it means him no harm that needs the assistance of Bruce banner.

19
00:00:58.850 --> 00:01:01.910
Now the whole initially refuses to allow banner to retake control,

20
00:01:01.940 --> 00:01:06.020
but the orb turned the whole blue and manipulate his emotions to calm him down

21
00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:09.350
and causes him to revert back to banner. And it's here that we learn.

22
00:01:09.351 --> 00:01:11.510
The org is actually the unit power. Now,

23
00:01:11.511 --> 00:01:12.860
if you're not familiar with the unit power,

24
00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:16.940
it is a seemingly limitless source of cosmic power that bonds with those of

25
00:01:16.941 --> 00:01:18.800
noble spirit in times of crisis,

26
00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:23.090
granting them nearly unlimited power and basically transforms them into a cosmic

27
00:01:23.091 --> 00:01:25.070
superhero known as captain universe.

28
00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:28.100
Now the power is bonded with several characters in the Marvel universe,

29
00:01:28.130 --> 00:01:29.090
including Bruce banner,

30
00:01:29.120 --> 00:01:32.570
who recognized the power as it had once bonded with him to split him from the

31
00:01:32.930 --> 00:01:35.630
hole in an attempt to rid himself of what he viewed as a curse.

32
00:01:35.690 --> 00:01:38.750
Obviously it didn't work, but banner is excited to have another try.

33
00:01:38.780 --> 00:01:42.200
Now the unit power informs him that the reason for his visit is different.

34
00:01:42.201 --> 00:01:46.070
This time as the power itself has been compromised and is in a weakened state,

35
00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:49.520
that's where the unit power seeks to bond with the hole and replicate his power

36
00:01:49.670 --> 00:01:53.330
and also wants banners assistance in finding a scientist named Dr. Gilbert

37
00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:57.710
Wiles, Earth's foremost expert on the unit power to try and figure out why it is

38
00:01:57.711 --> 00:01:58.280
weakening.

39
00:01:58.280 --> 00:02:02.360
And so banner is initially hesitant to help because Dr. Wiles is a Manhattan and

40
00:02:02.361 --> 00:02:03.800
he's afraid that if he turns into the Hulk,

41
00:02:03.830 --> 00:02:05.570
he'll be a threat to all the people there.

42
00:02:05.660 --> 00:02:08.690
And we learned the reason that he's in the wilderness is to be far enough away

43
00:02:08.691 --> 00:02:11.810
from civilization, that nobody will get hurt if he transforms.

44
00:02:11.930 --> 00:02:15.710
And so after receiving assurance from the unit power that the whole ego is being

45
00:02:15.711 --> 00:02:18.470
repressed, banner goes to Manhattan and finds Dr.

46
00:02:18.920 --> 00:02:20.750
Weil's now wanting to conceal his true identity.

47
00:02:20.810 --> 00:02:24.020
Banner introduces himself to Dr. Wiles as Bruce Barnes.

48
00:02:24.080 --> 00:02:27.470
Who's looking for information about the unit power shortly thereafter.

49
00:02:27.530 --> 00:02:29.180
They're joined by Dr. David Garrett,

50
00:02:29.210 --> 00:02:32.960
who says he's bankrolling Wiles research in hopes that unlocking the secret of

51
00:02:32.961 --> 00:02:35.120
the unit power will be beneficial for mankind.

52
00:02:35.240 --> 00:02:39.050
Suddenly Gary gets a call from agents from advanced idea mechanics that are on

53
00:02:39.290 --> 00:02:39.291
board.

54
00:02:39.291 --> 00:02:43.190
A submarine that informed here at the unit power is currently inside banner.

55
00:02:43.220 --> 00:02:47.030
Meanwhile, Wiles tells Garrett that he was also once the host of the unit power.

56
00:02:47.060 --> 00:02:50.870
When a plane he was on was hijacked and he was able to use his powers to thwart

57
00:02:50.871 --> 00:02:54.560
the hijackers and safely land the plane. Then as swiftly as it arrived,

58
00:02:54.590 --> 00:02:58.100
the power left him and had been searching for more knowledge of it ever since

59
00:02:58.130 --> 00:03:01.210
now, Garrett then announces that he knows of the unit of how his presence within

60
00:03:01.211 --> 00:03:05.020
banner and fires a beam at ambit drives the unit power from banner Hoke.

61
00:03:05.020 --> 00:03:08.530
Of course then takes over and is immediately attacked by two robots that were

62
00:03:08.950 --> 00:03:09.580
flunking Garrett. Now,

63
00:03:09.580 --> 00:03:12.970
once the AME agents realize who they're dealing with the open up their entire

64
00:03:12.971 --> 00:03:14.230
arsenal to fight the Hawk,

65
00:03:14.290 --> 00:03:18.040
including weapons that had not yet been tested and it's a whole quickly gains

66
00:03:18.041 --> 00:03:18.730
the upper hand,

67
00:03:18.730 --> 00:03:22.360
but as soon overpowered by the robots who hit him with a beam of some energy

68
00:03:22.390 --> 00:03:26.470
that appears to cause him great distress, however, the unit power, reappears,

69
00:03:26.530 --> 00:03:28.870
and merges with the hole again. And once again,

70
00:03:28.930 --> 00:03:30.970
turns him into the blue version of the hole.

71
00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:34.750
Now what the powers of captain universe hope remarks now hope is really the

72
00:03:34.751 --> 00:03:35.411
strongest one.

73
00:03:35.411 --> 00:03:39.700
There is suggesting that his power level far surpasses any power that he's ever

74
00:03:39.701 --> 00:03:43.260
encountered hope easily to feeds the robot that were attacking him and turns

75
00:03:43.261 --> 00:03:46.950
around to see the body of David Garrett with Dr. Weil standing over him,

76
00:03:47.200 --> 00:03:49.590
whole concludes that Wiles has killed Garrett,

77
00:03:49.680 --> 00:03:51.720
which he thinks was the right thing to do, obviously,

78
00:03:51.780 --> 00:03:55.080
but Wiles informs him that it was actually the bonding process, which we,

79
00:03:55.081 --> 00:03:58.200
the unit power and the Hawk that produce a flash of energy that killed Garrett.

80
00:03:58.320 --> 00:04:01.620
And so as the police descend upon the scene, hope, wants to stay in fight.

81
00:04:01.650 --> 00:04:02.071
The banner,

82
00:04:02.071 --> 00:04:05.370
convinces him to leave which results in Wiles being arrested for Garrett's

83
00:04:05.371 --> 00:04:08.940
murder. Now later we see Bruce banner calling Matt Murdock from a payphone,

84
00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:10.350
and that's where the issue ends.

85
00:04:10.440 --> 00:04:14.280
And this would actually go on to be a crossover series where the unit power is

86
00:04:14.281 --> 00:04:16.620
passed from hero to hero. And so in the next issue,

87
00:04:16.680 --> 00:04:19.380
which reveals that Matt has agreed to represent Wiles,

88
00:04:19.410 --> 00:04:23.010
the unit power bonds with Derek. And then of course it goes on from there. Now,

89
00:04:23.011 --> 00:04:25.890
maybe we'll cover this story if it's something that you guys are interested in,

90
00:04:25.920 --> 00:04:28.620
but for now, we'll just focus on the blue hole. As I said earlier,

91
00:04:28.710 --> 00:04:32.310
this is unfortunately all the we get to see of the blue for the unit power

92
00:04:32.311 --> 00:04:35.040
leaves him. And as far as I know, never bothered with him again.

93
00:04:35.130 --> 00:04:38.190
And the really disappointing part of the whole having this power for such a

94
00:04:38.191 --> 00:04:41.340
short period of time as if we don't get to see him use the power to its full

95
00:04:41.341 --> 00:04:45.600
potential, not by a long shot. He just beats up some robots in the lease.

96
00:04:45.690 --> 00:04:47.880
And so it's sort of a dissatisfying conclusion,

97
00:04:47.910 --> 00:04:52.020
but even though we never get to see it fully realized central of the Hawk being

98
00:04:52.021 --> 00:04:54.060
bonded with the unit power is a mince.

99
00:04:54.300 --> 00:04:58.020
And just to get a sense of why through the abilities that the unit power

100
00:04:58.080 --> 00:04:59.430
typically grants its hosts.

101
00:04:59.490 --> 00:05:03.690
So typically anyone who possesses the unit power has their appearance changed to

102
00:05:04.020 --> 00:05:07.800
Donna captain universe uniformed. But this change is not just a static.

103
00:05:07.920 --> 00:05:11.550
It actually grants an extra layer of protection to the user by forming a

104
00:05:11.551 --> 00:05:14.970
protective layer of molecules around them that protects them from radiation,

105
00:05:14.971 --> 00:05:19.140
extreme temperatures or any number of harmful substances while the Hulk does not

106
00:05:19.141 --> 00:05:22.380
Dawn the traditional uniform of Katelyn universe, he does turn blue,

107
00:05:22.440 --> 00:05:26.190
which means that his layer protection is probably present for him as well.

108
00:05:26.250 --> 00:05:29.760
Other hosts of the unit power have also displayed a wide array of powers,

109
00:05:29.820 --> 00:05:33.420
such as flight telepathy and have been able to manipulate energy time and even

110
00:05:33.421 --> 00:05:36.450
matter in reality. And so when we're talking about the unit power,

111
00:05:36.540 --> 00:05:41.010
it can turn anyone at bonds too, into an entity that is well beyond Omega level.

112
00:05:41.100 --> 00:05:44.790
And that's especially true with someone that's already as powerful as the Holt

113
00:05:44.820 --> 00:05:48.000
is granted. The unit power was weakened possess the Hulk,

114
00:05:48.030 --> 00:05:51.420
but I still think that we only saw the smallest fraction of what the hole was

115
00:05:51.421 --> 00:05:55.770
capable of doing with it and shame that we didn't see him keep it longer or go

116
00:05:55.771 --> 00:05:59.120
up against a bigger threat during the short time as the blue Hawk.

117
00:05:59.150 --> 00:06:02.360
But that's about it guys. Like I said, only a brief appearance as a blue hole.

118
00:06:02.390 --> 00:06:04.100
And while we didn't really get to see much adamant,

119
00:06:04.250 --> 00:06:06.800
knowing what we know about both the Hulk and the unit power,

120
00:06:06.830 --> 00:06:11.360
we know he would be capable of some incredibly impressive feats if he needed to.

121
00:06:11.630 --> 00:06:14.330
And we were talking about an incredible hope that would have virtually any

122
00:06:14.331 --> 00:06:17.120
superpower. He needed an energy projection time, travel,

123
00:06:17.210 --> 00:06:20.120
reality war being matter of manipulation on a universal scale,

124
00:06:20.180 --> 00:06:24.650
all kinds of crazy things, right? It really would be a ridiculously Opie Hawk.

125
00:06:24.680 --> 00:06:25.760
And to give a guy's perspective,

126
00:06:25.820 --> 00:06:30.530
this goes way beyond heart of the monster Hawk way AB on that way beyond Herald

127
00:06:30.540 --> 00:06:34.280
of Galactus whole, this, this turns hope and to a cosmic entity.

128
00:06:34.580 --> 00:06:36.800
But with that being said, guys, we're gonna bring this video to an end,

129
00:06:36.980 --> 00:06:40.250
let me know down in the comments section, what video you want me to do next,

130
00:06:40.280 --> 00:06:43.310
right? Because we're kind of running out of characters to do. And honestly,

131
00:06:43.370 --> 00:06:46.700
I kind of liked the idea of mashing up characters that we don't normally get to

132
00:06:46.701 --> 00:06:50.090
see. Right? Like if we had Franklin Richards who got the infinity gauntlet,

133
00:06:50.150 --> 00:06:53.600
or if we had iron man who had the power of the beyond hours,

134
00:06:53.630 --> 00:06:56.660
or like if Wolverine became the specter from DC comics, right.

135
00:06:56.830 --> 00:06:58.610
We've got to learn to think out of the box guys.

136
00:06:58.640 --> 00:07:03.290
We've gotta learn to think out of the box and make up our own stuff. But anyway,

137
00:07:03.291 --> 00:07:04.940
yeah, guys, we're gonna bring this video to an end.

138
00:07:04.970 --> 00:07:07.550
Thank you guys for watching and we'll catch you all later.

139
