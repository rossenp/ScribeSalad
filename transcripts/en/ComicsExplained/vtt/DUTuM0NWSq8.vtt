1
00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:01.470
<v 0>What's going on guys. This is Robin.</v>

2
00:00:01.471 --> 00:00:03.240
A lot of the guys have been asking for Rob pourings.

3
00:00:03.270 --> 00:00:07.890
So we are going to put them on sale. I'm going to sell 20 Robb pore rings.

4
00:00:07.920 --> 00:00:10.860
And I'm curious to see how many people are interested in that. Right?

5
00:00:10.861 --> 00:00:13.020
How many people are actually interested in buying Rob court rings?

6
00:00:13.270 --> 00:00:15.030
So I'm going to sell 20 Robin poor rings.

7
00:00:15.090 --> 00:00:18.660
I'm going to have a link down in the description is going to be an email.

8
00:00:18.810 --> 00:00:22.110
You are going to send a link or you're going to send an email to that email

9
00:00:22.111 --> 00:00:25.650
address. You're going to title it, Rob core ring. If you title it,

10
00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:29.010
anything other than that, I'm going to ignore it and I'm going to delete it.

11
00:00:29.040 --> 00:00:32.430
Right? So put in rod core, ring in the subject from there,

12
00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:34.560
you don't really have to type anything. You can type whatever you want. I mean,

13
00:00:34.561 --> 00:00:37.050
just, you know, you cuss at me, I'm going to, I'm not, I'm gonna ignore you.

14
00:00:37.080 --> 00:00:40.050
Right. But I'll just type in anything you want to do. Like Superman is amazing,

15
00:00:40.051 --> 00:00:42.210
right? Like Batman sucks, whatever you want to put in there,

16
00:00:42.330 --> 00:00:43.170
but it doesn't really matter to me.

17
00:00:43.380 --> 00:00:46.230
And then I will randomly pick 20 of you guys. And then in turn,

18
00:00:46.231 --> 00:00:49.920
I will send you a link to a website where you can buy a Rob core ring. So yeah,

19
00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:51.870
hopefully you, hopefully you guys win good luck.

20
00:00:51.990 --> 00:00:54.570
We're kind of testing this to see how many people actually want to buy one.

21
00:00:54.660 --> 00:00:57.270
And uh, yeah, let's start the video.

22
00:00:59.490 --> 00:01:03.200
What's going on guys. This is Rob and we are back with, uh, dark nights,

23
00:01:03.230 --> 00:01:06.950
death metal and DC is rebooting. Well,

24
00:01:07.010 --> 00:01:08.990
maybe rebooting is not the best phrase,

25
00:01:08.991 --> 00:01:12.680
I guess like unreal booting on crisis thing. It's a little weird.

26
00:01:12.681 --> 00:01:14.810
You guys understand what I'm talking about once we get to this point,

27
00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:16.350
but what we're going to be doing here is,

28
00:01:16.351 --> 00:01:19.970
is picking up with the Robin King after he's kind of faced off against wonder

29
00:01:19.971 --> 00:01:22.790
woman and all these different poses. And it's not a very lengthy thing, right?

30
00:01:22.791 --> 00:01:25.880
He kind of starts talking trash to a little bit saying that on his world,

31
00:01:25.910 --> 00:01:29.600
that wonder woman led a whole bunch of the superheroes to face off against him.

32
00:01:29.720 --> 00:01:32.820
And they won, right? You gave the script a huge impassioned speech. And,

33
00:01:32.821 --> 00:01:34.820
and following that he actually ended up killing her,

34
00:01:34.850 --> 00:01:38.240
but they gave her this kind of, uh, this metal, like for honor and courage,

35
00:01:38.241 --> 00:01:40.490
they gave it to her for leading the forces against Robin King.

36
00:01:40.550 --> 00:01:42.950
And then he basically booby trapped it, right? So it ended up killing her.

37
00:01:42.951 --> 00:01:44.330
And then after that, the world fell to him,

38
00:01:44.360 --> 00:01:46.820
but it's just kind of him talking trash to her a little bit,

39
00:01:46.821 --> 00:01:48.710
kind of tormenting her. It's not super important.

40
00:01:48.740 --> 00:01:52.820
What is really important here is that when they try to go after the Batman who

41
00:01:52.821 --> 00:01:55.610
laughs, he basically tells the, uh, the, you know,

42
00:01:55.611 --> 00:01:58.670
tells castle bat to keep them in, keep them at Bay by to keep them there.

43
00:01:58.760 --> 00:02:01.640
And castle bat is an actual sentience bat right now.

44
00:02:01.730 --> 00:02:02.870
One of the funny things about this,

45
00:02:02.871 --> 00:02:05.890
and this is one of these things where it's a little intriguing when it comes to

46
00:02:05.900 --> 00:02:06.650
death metal.

47
00:02:06.650 --> 00:02:09.410
This really is a story where it's all about these different iterations of Batman

48
00:02:09.411 --> 00:02:11.870
from across the dark multiverse, right? A place that,

49
00:02:11.900 --> 00:02:16.400
that consists of everybody's worst fears and nightmares from the main DC

50
00:02:16.401 --> 00:02:16.970
universe.

51
00:02:16.970 --> 00:02:21.170
But the idea is that it's entirely possible that Batman who laughs just made

52
00:02:21.171 --> 00:02:24.080
this giant castle sentience, or maybe it was always that way, right?

53
00:02:24.081 --> 00:02:26.900
Batman somehow managed to merge himself into a giant castle.

54
00:02:26.901 --> 00:02:28.760
And then that's just where he exists. We don't really know.

55
00:02:28.850 --> 00:02:30.320
And it doesn't really matter for the most part.

56
00:02:30.350 --> 00:02:33.830
None of the heroes can do anything to stop him. That, that literally the, the,

57
00:02:34.040 --> 00:02:37.100
this bat just kind of starts defeating these guys piece by piece.

58
00:02:37.160 --> 00:02:38.360
And in the middle of all this,

59
00:02:38.560 --> 00:02:42.500
there's suddenly rescued by some person that they can't only for us to find out

60
00:02:42.530 --> 00:02:44.480
that it's actually a, it's actually Lex Luther,

61
00:02:44.481 --> 00:02:47.180
who showed up here with the kind of Legion of duty headquarters, right?

62
00:02:47.181 --> 00:02:50.360
This floating ship from back in the day, this is old school. Those guys,

63
00:02:50.420 --> 00:02:54.440
you don't know, this is O G O G like during the silver age of comics OJI, right?

64
00:02:54.440 --> 00:02:58.460
It's it's super old school, but he basically kind of shows up here and says,

65
00:02:58.461 --> 00:03:00.370
the important thing to understand is like,

66
00:03:00.400 --> 00:03:02.560
I want you here in the hall of Duke one, because you gotta,

67
00:03:02.561 --> 00:03:04.720
you gotta get out of here as fast as you can. And two,

68
00:03:04.750 --> 00:03:07.630
because I have a plan for this and the kind of funny thing about this is they're

69
00:03:07.631 --> 00:03:10.630
very, very wary of trusting Lex Luther and rightfully so.

70
00:03:10.660 --> 00:03:12.490
You're talking about a guy who, you know,

71
00:03:12.491 --> 00:03:15.880
on any given day is the arch nemesis of the world's greatest superhero.

72
00:03:15.940 --> 00:03:17.860
And always trying to find a way to defeat him,

73
00:03:17.890 --> 00:03:21.540
but all of this started because Lex Luther freed Perpetua,

74
00:03:21.600 --> 00:03:22.830
but had it not been for him,

75
00:03:22.920 --> 00:03:24.960
none of this would have been the problem in the first place,

76
00:03:24.961 --> 00:03:28.290
but the response of Lex is yeah, but I've kind of learned my lesson here, right?

77
00:03:28.290 --> 00:03:30.620
Like I've learned, I've understood. I understand the mistake that I,

78
00:03:30.630 --> 00:03:32.510
I made him doing all this. So it's important.

79
00:03:32.550 --> 00:03:35.100
You guys trust me because this is basically the end of the day.

80
00:03:35.540 --> 00:03:38.190
And I have a plan to stop Perpetua once. And for all,

81
00:03:38.220 --> 00:03:41.580
you also see a fight kind of being instigated between Perpetua and the Batman

82
00:03:41.581 --> 00:03:43.650
who laughs. This is not an overly important thing.

83
00:03:43.710 --> 00:03:44.580
It's really just kind of like,

84
00:03:44.581 --> 00:03:47.580
you know how it is a end up fighting in the first place that he basically tracks

85
00:03:47.581 --> 00:03:49.500
her down and says like, I'm going to kill you. Right?

86
00:03:49.501 --> 00:03:51.090
And then I'm going to take your power.

87
00:03:51.091 --> 00:03:53.520
And then I'm just going to recreate all of existence in my own image,

88
00:03:53.550 --> 00:03:56.820
basically bring the dark multiverse ended up positive multi-verse than just make

89
00:03:56.821 --> 00:03:59.370
everybody's life awful. Right. That's kind of his whole stance here.

90
00:03:59.400 --> 00:04:02.160
The important thing is when the fight begins,

91
00:04:02.190 --> 00:04:04.380
that's when Lex says the clock is now ticking,

92
00:04:04.650 --> 00:04:06.240
but the countdown timer has now begun.

93
00:04:06.300 --> 00:04:09.240
And when he kind of kinda hits out here is he says the whole purpose of the

94
00:04:09.241 --> 00:04:13.710
Batman who laughs the whole goal of this guy is to basically use all the

95
00:04:13.711 --> 00:04:17.790
fears that everybody here has and turn them into something tangible, right?

96
00:04:17.791 --> 00:04:21.150
Because the dark multi-verse is kind of this intangible thing that exists out

97
00:04:21.151 --> 00:04:24.210
there, right? It's this intangible concept that you can travel to. Right?

98
00:04:24.211 --> 00:04:26.670
But most people out there are blissfully unaware of it, right.

99
00:04:26.671 --> 00:04:29.490
They just kind of assume that like their worst fears or their worst nightmares,

100
00:04:29.520 --> 00:04:30.630
just kind of, you know,

101
00:04:30.631 --> 00:04:33.750
dissipate out there into the ether or they exist only in their subconscious,

102
00:04:33.751 --> 00:04:35.760
in the form of their dreams. And that's it, right? That's,

103
00:04:35.761 --> 00:04:39.750
that's really all that ever really happened. The reality is they become worlds.

104
00:04:39.780 --> 00:04:43.870
They become quite literally worlds that you can go to. And so the whole idea,

105
00:04:44.310 --> 00:04:47.370
this is those worlds are going to become our world, right?

106
00:04:47.370 --> 00:04:50.940
It's going to become the DC universe there and everything they know here is

107
00:04:50.941 --> 00:04:54.240
going to be matter is going to be replaced with these dark and twisted versions.

108
00:04:54.300 --> 00:04:56.160
And so what he says is that at the moment,

109
00:04:56.190 --> 00:04:59.670
the Batman who laughs only has a handful of these baby worlds, right?

110
00:04:59.671 --> 00:05:03.090
These worlds that he's creating based on people's dark experiences, right?

111
00:05:03.091 --> 00:05:07.260
Because it takes time to move the dark multi-verse into the positive multi-verse

112
00:05:07.261 --> 00:05:09.810
right. And it's not really just kind of moving it. That's what Barbados did,

113
00:05:09.811 --> 00:05:09.961
right?

114
00:05:09.961 --> 00:05:12.990
It's not really dragging the positive multi-verse down into the dark multiverse

115
00:05:12.991 --> 00:05:15.120
or anything like that. It's creating literal worlds.

116
00:05:15.150 --> 00:05:18.270
And it's important thing to understand because what it establishes here is that

117
00:05:18.271 --> 00:05:21.870
despite having the powers of document Hatton and being able to use them to their

118
00:05:21.871 --> 00:05:24.510
full totality, there's still limits on what he can do.

119
00:05:24.600 --> 00:05:27.570
And that's one of the big differences, I think, between Marvel and DC, right?

120
00:05:27.570 --> 00:05:29.130
That if this was like a Marvel comic story,

121
00:05:29.250 --> 00:05:31.920
like you just have Batman who laughs snaps his fingers and just some leaves,

122
00:05:31.921 --> 00:05:35.850
all the worst things in existence that I'll just manifest instantaneously DCS.

123
00:05:35.970 --> 00:05:39.480
It's a lot more grounded when it comes to their flights of fancy and those crazy

124
00:05:39.481 --> 00:05:41.040
stories and wonky abilities.

125
00:05:41.041 --> 00:05:44.220
And everything's like that you'll never really see like a Franklin Richards type

126
00:05:44.221 --> 00:05:48.900
character or like a beyond her or a molecule man, you've seen analogs to them,

127
00:05:48.960 --> 00:05:53.280
but you won't really see a character with a level of power that high up on in DC

128
00:05:53.281 --> 00:05:56.190
being used in that way. People will have that kind of power,

129
00:05:56.220 --> 00:05:59.450
but it's not like you'll have a situation where like specter gets off.

130
00:05:59.451 --> 00:06:01.970
So he just walks out and just snapped his fingers and half the life in the

131
00:06:01.971 --> 00:06:02.870
universe vanishes.

132
00:06:02.960 --> 00:06:06.290
And so what you end up having here is this kind of discussion where he says

133
00:06:06.291 --> 00:06:09.520
this, this proposition that he has as is not that they think big,

134
00:06:09.580 --> 00:06:11.260
but that they think small, right?

135
00:06:11.260 --> 00:06:14.380
They think on the small scale and kind of work their way backwards.

136
00:06:14.410 --> 00:06:17.440
And that's what makes them so interesting is because where you have this great

137
00:06:17.441 --> 00:06:19.900
big, huge exposition offered by Lex, what are you kind of does?

138
00:06:19.901 --> 00:06:23.050
Is he said that in his younger years, he grew up in T grew up in Smallville,

139
00:06:23.080 --> 00:06:25.480
right? This is kind of an old school origin from back in the day.

140
00:06:25.510 --> 00:06:27.700
And it's basically remained steadfast ever since,

141
00:06:27.730 --> 00:06:29.560
but Lex Luther grew up in Smallville, right?

142
00:06:29.561 --> 00:06:32.920
He grew up in a place that was literally dedicated to the idea of being small.

143
00:06:32.950 --> 00:06:36.310
And it always fascinated him, this idea that you had this great, big, huge,

144
00:06:36.340 --> 00:06:39.370
expansive universe out there that in the beginning, there was the big bang,

145
00:06:39.430 --> 00:06:39.611
right?

146
00:06:39.611 --> 00:06:44.200
Just a singular coalescence of energy that basically reached a kind of critical

147
00:06:44.201 --> 00:06:46.510
mass through gravity and exploded,

148
00:06:46.511 --> 00:06:49.600
outward giving birth to everything that we know that came into existence.

149
00:06:49.780 --> 00:06:51.190
And that was fascinating for him. Now,

150
00:06:51.350 --> 00:06:53.950
he he's saying that really more from a human perspective as the reader,

151
00:06:54.070 --> 00:06:56.380
we know there were a lot of other working parts that were going on, right?

152
00:06:56.381 --> 00:06:59.590
The presidents and Perpetua and the people who sit Perpetua,

153
00:06:59.620 --> 00:07:01.810
different things like that. So we know there's a lot more to it than that,

154
00:07:01.811 --> 00:07:03.430
but it all started with a big bang.

155
00:07:03.490 --> 00:07:07.150
And it was fascinating because what ended up happening is that his home life was

156
00:07:07.151 --> 00:07:08.140
exceedingly abusive.

157
00:07:08.230 --> 00:07:11.260
And what he ended up doing was actually going out to the planetarium all the

158
00:07:11.261 --> 00:07:11.560
time.

159
00:07:11.560 --> 00:07:14.890
But the person who would play the entire sequence actually ended up playing it

160
00:07:14.891 --> 00:07:15.490
backwards.

161
00:07:15.490 --> 00:07:18.370
And it started with the end of the universe and went back to its very beginning

162
00:07:18.400 --> 00:07:19.750
and it scared the heck out of him. Right?

163
00:07:19.751 --> 00:07:22.960
Because it basically established this idea in the mind of Lex that everything

164
00:07:22.961 --> 00:07:23.770
dies, right.

165
00:07:23.770 --> 00:07:26.830
That it's inevitable that everything is going to end then in some form or

166
00:07:26.831 --> 00:07:30.190
fashion, everything that was will die again. And he told his dad that, right.

167
00:07:30.191 --> 00:07:32.020
And his dad kind of reiterated. Yeah.

168
00:07:32.050 --> 00:07:34.900
Like everything out here will come to an end. Right.

169
00:07:34.901 --> 00:07:37.330
He was kind of a Dick to him and said like, go make something of yourself,

170
00:07:37.331 --> 00:07:38.640
you know? But it was like everything that,

171
00:07:38.641 --> 00:07:42.700
that exists will inevitably come to an end. And that's the response of Lex here.

172
00:07:42.701 --> 00:07:46.600
His whole idea is we keep thinking about this from the perspective of it started

173
00:07:46.601 --> 00:07:48.100
with a big bang or starts with this event.

174
00:07:48.101 --> 00:07:49.300
And then it turns into something bigger.

175
00:07:49.330 --> 00:07:52.570
Let's kind of trace this to really kind of the end result and work our way

176
00:07:52.571 --> 00:07:55.080
backward. Right? Like we're at the end game right now. Right.

177
00:07:55.090 --> 00:07:58.570
So instead of asking what comes next, let's ask what came before?

178
00:07:58.630 --> 00:08:02.020
How did we get to this point? Not even just in terms of me and Perpetua,

179
00:08:02.050 --> 00:08:05.950
but everything that came before, right? He's talking about crises events.

180
00:08:06.040 --> 00:08:07.000
He's talking about the event,

181
00:08:07.001 --> 00:08:10.030
the crisis events that came before and he even references this, right?

182
00:08:10.031 --> 00:08:13.150
He says that in terms of all this crisis energy that we have,

183
00:08:13.151 --> 00:08:16.480
it's born of all of our fears, right? All of our, our current concerns,

184
00:08:16.481 --> 00:08:18.010
our worries, different things like that.

185
00:08:18.580 --> 00:08:22.300
Krona wanted to look into the past and see the very beginnings of the universe,

186
00:08:22.420 --> 00:08:22.960
its creation,

187
00:08:22.960 --> 00:08:26.710
which led to basically the whole concept of the anti-modern or at least that was

188
00:08:26.711 --> 00:08:28.360
the old school story from back in the day.

189
00:08:28.450 --> 00:08:31.900
And the reality of this is that it was fear that led to that. Or it was a,

190
00:08:31.901 --> 00:08:35.380
it was curiosity or some kind of negative emotion that led to that, right.

191
00:08:35.380 --> 00:08:36.580
That led to those sequence of events.

192
00:08:36.610 --> 00:08:40.150
And you see it over and over and over again, right? Zero hour, crisis, and time.

193
00:08:40.180 --> 00:08:44.020
The fear of how Jordan you go into infinite crisis, the fear of Superboy prime,

194
00:08:44.050 --> 00:08:46.210
you go into final crisis, the death of dark side.

195
00:08:46.240 --> 00:08:49.060
You see like all of these things kind of playing out in such a way to where

196
00:08:49.061 --> 00:08:52.060
every crisis event is rooted in negative emotions.

197
00:08:52.090 --> 00:08:56.670
And so his idea is what if we use it, we have a kind of energy that's connected,

198
00:08:56.700 --> 00:08:58.200
right? That brings us together.

199
00:08:58.260 --> 00:09:01.560
What if we trace this back to its root and we undo it, right?

200
00:09:01.561 --> 00:09:04.470
We literally undo the first crisis. If we undo that,

201
00:09:04.471 --> 00:09:07.950
then every crisis coming after will effectively cease to exist. Right?

202
00:09:07.951 --> 00:09:08.700
It'll never happen.

203
00:09:08.700 --> 00:09:11.820
What's happening here is that through Scott Snyder in writing this story,

204
00:09:11.880 --> 00:09:16.200
DC is in effect going back and undoing every single prices event that they've

205
00:09:16.201 --> 00:09:18.240
had. And he tells this to wonder will more.

206
00:09:18.241 --> 00:09:21.570
She says that initially she used anti-crisis energy against Perpetua and it

207
00:09:21.571 --> 00:09:25.470
didn't work prices. Energy was far more powerful. The responsive Lex is no,

208
00:09:25.471 --> 00:09:29.370
it wasn't used to come to your fear. If you had actually stood fast with that,

209
00:09:29.371 --> 00:09:32.460
that anti-crisis energy you were using, you would have overcome her,

210
00:09:32.490 --> 00:09:36.000
but you would have overtaken Perpetua, but instead you were governed by fear.

211
00:09:36.060 --> 00:09:38.070
And in your fear, she got the upper hand,

212
00:09:38.071 --> 00:09:42.000
she tricked you and she basically duped you into effectively losing the fight.

213
00:09:42.030 --> 00:09:44.520
The other part of this is we end up learning a few things.

214
00:09:44.580 --> 00:09:48.780
One Batman's debt that end's been dead ever since the beginning of the story now

215
00:09:48.870 --> 00:09:51.840
with something that we kind of believed because we had never officially been

216
00:09:51.841 --> 00:09:54.210
told that, but it looked to be the case, right?

217
00:09:54.211 --> 00:09:56.820
Like you have the whole collapse. You had Batman who looked like he died,

218
00:09:56.850 --> 00:09:57.840
but inexplicably,

219
00:09:57.841 --> 00:10:01.110
he just came back and we assumed that it was just because he's Batman, right.

220
00:10:01.410 --> 00:10:02.820
Anxious, too popular to kill off. You know,

221
00:10:02.821 --> 00:10:04.550
like it's just one of those kinds of hand-wavy things.

222
00:10:04.560 --> 00:10:08.670
Like how did Batman get back here on Batman comics? You know,

223
00:10:08.730 --> 00:10:11.940
and that's kind of what we attributed it to the reality of this is at Batman's

224
00:10:11.941 --> 00:10:14.760
always been dead. And that's why he uses the black lantern ring.

225
00:10:14.790 --> 00:10:17.580
It's the only way for him to continue existing in his current form.

226
00:10:17.610 --> 00:10:21.230
Superman was bathed in the pools of dark side and is basically a,

227
00:10:21.320 --> 00:10:24.840
he's a force of dark side. Now there's no taking him back to what he was before.

228
00:10:24.870 --> 00:10:28.410
There's no undoing that in effect of the Trinity wonder woman is the only one

229
00:10:28.440 --> 00:10:31.050
who's actually still alive and in her current form. And so it was,

230
00:10:31.051 --> 00:10:34.830
it's kind of nuts here because it's a way to effectively undo everything that's

231
00:10:34.840 --> 00:10:36.840
happened, going all the way back to the beginning.

232
00:10:36.841 --> 00:10:40.860
Now that was initially the purpose of DC rebirth was to kind of take the things

233
00:10:40.861 --> 00:10:42.060
that worked and the things that didn't work.

234
00:10:42.061 --> 00:10:45.690
The reality is that this story is probably about four years behind the curve.

235
00:10:45.750 --> 00:10:46.800
If I'm being honest with you guys,

236
00:10:46.801 --> 00:10:50.460
it's about a little over four and a half years later than we expected it to be.

237
00:10:50.490 --> 00:10:54.030
But it kind of makes sense because if DC rebirth served the purpose of figuring

238
00:10:54.031 --> 00:10:55.290
out what worked and what didn't work,

239
00:10:55.320 --> 00:10:57.270
bringing back some things and so on and so forth,

240
00:10:57.330 --> 00:11:00.390
then it would take time to figure that out. Right? It's one thing to say,

241
00:11:00.420 --> 00:11:02.520
everybody wants to see the red-haired Wally West come back.

242
00:11:02.521 --> 00:11:04.410
So we'll bring him back. It's another to say, like,

243
00:11:04.440 --> 00:11:06.150
what else do people want to see return?

244
00:11:06.240 --> 00:11:08.100
And now that we've had the last four and a half years,

245
00:11:08.180 --> 00:11:12.060
and we kind of have a general idea of what it is that people want DC can now fix

246
00:11:12.061 --> 00:11:14.460
all that. And that's literally what Lex tells wonder woman,

247
00:11:14.490 --> 00:11:16.500
like what's going to happen here is you're going to,

248
00:11:16.530 --> 00:11:17.760
you're going to perform this act.

249
00:11:17.761 --> 00:11:21.090
Things are going to go back and you're basically going to re restore everybody's

250
00:11:21.091 --> 00:11:21.720
memories.

251
00:11:21.720 --> 00:11:24.750
You're going to restore everyone's memories back to the way they were before,

252
00:11:24.810 --> 00:11:27.480
essentially before the events of flashpoint. Now, again,

253
00:11:27.600 --> 00:11:29.190
that in combination with undoing,

254
00:11:29.191 --> 00:11:33.990
all the crises basically seems to mean that what DC's doing is eliminating all

255
00:11:33.991 --> 00:11:35.130
the different prices, events,

256
00:11:35.160 --> 00:11:38.700
and all the reboots and all the wreck cons and all the reworkings and kind of

257
00:11:38.701 --> 00:11:41.790
seeming to start back during the silver age and just sort of calling it a day

258
00:11:41.850 --> 00:11:44.550
and taking all the things that have worked now and all the things that worked

259
00:11:44.551 --> 00:11:47.220
during the silver age and all the things that worked after crisis on infinite

260
00:11:47.221 --> 00:11:50.580
earths and all the things that worked after zero hour and after infinite crisis

261
00:11:50.581 --> 00:11:53.070
and after final prices, all those things that seem to work,

262
00:11:53.500 --> 00:11:56.680
it's all being consolidated into a singular timeline. Now,

263
00:11:56.710 --> 00:11:58.570
the question that you have to ask here is,

264
00:11:58.630 --> 00:12:01.990
are we going to get new origins because to do something this big,

265
00:12:02.020 --> 00:12:05.050
you can't really just do this and then leave things the way they are.

266
00:12:05.080 --> 00:12:07.540
Or you can tell a series of stories, belonging to characters,

267
00:12:07.541 --> 00:12:10.630
kind of reworking things, and then point back to a particular story, right?

268
00:12:10.631 --> 00:12:13.360
Just have some little asterisk down there, see Superman secret origin,

269
00:12:13.361 --> 00:12:15.580
number one by Jeff Johns. If you want to know Superman's origin,

270
00:12:15.610 --> 00:12:18.490
we don't really know. We do know that that DC is doing their great big,

271
00:12:18.491 --> 00:12:21.220
huge event. I think in January or whatever it is,

272
00:12:21.250 --> 00:12:23.680
where we get like future state. Like we know we're getting that now,

273
00:12:23.681 --> 00:12:25.300
whether or not this leads into that,

274
00:12:25.330 --> 00:12:28.270
or some kind of an event's going to take place between now and then not a

275
00:12:28.271 --> 00:12:31.150
hundred percent sure as far as I gather future state deals with the future of

276
00:12:31.151 --> 00:12:32.020
everything else, right.

277
00:12:32.020 --> 00:12:34.420
Doesn't really deal with the characters in the here and now it's just kind of

278
00:12:34.421 --> 00:12:35.770
the next generation of heroes.

279
00:12:35.800 --> 00:12:38.710
So I don't really know exactly how these things are going to tie together.

280
00:12:38.740 --> 00:12:43.060
But the important thing here is that because earth zero is kind of the focal

281
00:12:43.061 --> 00:12:43.631
point, right?

282
00:12:43.631 --> 00:12:48.490
The prime point by which the dark multi-verse exists and the way in which, uh,

283
00:12:48.520 --> 00:12:51.490
basically the Batman who laughs is creating all these different worlds.

284
00:12:51.520 --> 00:12:55.090
Then there's only one way to stop that if the Batman who laughs ability to

285
00:12:55.091 --> 00:12:59.290
create nightmarish worlds stems from the main DC universe and from earth

286
00:12:59.291 --> 00:13:01.930
specifically, the only way to fix that is to destroy it.

287
00:13:01.990 --> 00:13:03.440
And so what you end up getting is,

288
00:13:03.441 --> 00:13:06.250
is basically wonder woman who grabs Lobo and says, okay,

289
00:13:06.310 --> 00:13:08.800
I'm going to need your blood. And then with your originator of healing factor,

290
00:13:08.830 --> 00:13:10.990
we're going to create more of you. But we're going to duplicate you,

291
00:13:10.991 --> 00:13:14.080
which is really a power that Lobo has. If you were to slice off a finger,

292
00:13:14.170 --> 00:13:15.940
a Lobo could grow from that finger, right?

293
00:13:15.941 --> 00:13:17.830
That's one of the reasons why Lobo is kind of intriguing,

294
00:13:17.860 --> 00:13:19.660
he's Wolverine to the most extreme degree,

295
00:13:19.780 --> 00:13:22.810
but you literally have Superman who goes to like all these different villains

296
00:13:22.811 --> 00:13:25.480
who are out there, go select joker. He goes to granny, goodness, right?

297
00:13:25.481 --> 00:13:28.960
He goes to cyborg, Superman, Hank Henshaw, to a lot of these forces out there.

298
00:13:29.020 --> 00:13:30.190
And they're like, so what do you want us to do?

299
00:13:30.191 --> 00:13:33.550
Like band together and save the world. He's like, no, I want you to destroy it.

300
00:13:33.610 --> 00:13:37.270
And that's what they do with wonder woman's army of Lobo's with the diary of

301
00:13:37.271 --> 00:13:37.930
Hank Henshaw,

302
00:13:37.930 --> 00:13:41.470
which wonder woman needs in order to achieve all this information to pull off

303
00:13:41.471 --> 00:13:45.250
this task with Superboy prime, with Hank Henshaw, with bizarro, Superman,

304
00:13:45.251 --> 00:13:49.120
himself, with Sonesta arrow and the atrocities and star Sapphire,

305
00:13:49.150 --> 00:13:52.390
like all these lantern cores out there using like swamp thing using, uh,

306
00:13:52.391 --> 00:13:55.960
using black Adam with all their forces, they're going to obliterate the world,

307
00:13:56.020 --> 00:13:57.340
right? They're going to destroy the world.

308
00:13:57.341 --> 00:14:00.790
They're going to destroy all life on the planet and just leave it as an empty

309
00:14:00.791 --> 00:14:03.430
husk, right? By killing everybody on earth,

310
00:14:03.431 --> 00:14:06.870
which is a pretty drastic except to make by killing everybody on earth.

311
00:14:07.030 --> 00:14:10.800
This basically means that in turn the Batman who laughs cannot create any more

312
00:14:10.801 --> 00:14:13.830
dreams, he can't create any more dream world, the number of worlds he has now,

313
00:14:13.860 --> 00:14:16.740
that's where it stops. Now the other question to ask here is,

314
00:14:16.770 --> 00:14:18.190
is there a little bit of a, of a,

315
00:14:18.191 --> 00:14:22.410
a kind of a thing about this that doesn't make any sense? And the answer is yes,

316
00:14:22.440 --> 00:14:26.940
the reality is that what we've seen so far or the various nightmares world

317
00:14:26.970 --> 00:14:30.870
belonging to these superheroes. But as we know with the DC, multi-verse,

318
00:14:30.900 --> 00:14:34.140
it's an infinite number of universes where the dark multi-verse is an infinite

319
00:14:34.141 --> 00:14:37.380
number of dark universes. And so for every possible scenario,

320
00:14:37.500 --> 00:14:39.870
the Superman can envision being the worst case scenario.

321
00:14:39.900 --> 00:14:43.140
There's an infinite number of situations for that, right? Like say for example,

322
00:14:43.170 --> 00:14:46.920
that Superman ends up becoming dark side, right? That's the most obvious one to,

323
00:14:46.921 --> 00:14:50.730
to go, right? The dark side and fact Superman and takes over him, right?

324
00:14:50.760 --> 00:14:53.840
There's an infinite number of possibilities based on that one thing.

325
00:14:53.870 --> 00:14:56.570
What if he decides to conquer every world except earth?

326
00:14:56.571 --> 00:14:59.510
What if he destroys earth? What if he gets his hands on the anti-life equation?

327
00:14:59.511 --> 00:15:01.490
What if he doesn't get his hands on the anti-life equation?

328
00:15:01.520 --> 00:15:03.650
There's an infinite number of possibilities there.

329
00:15:03.710 --> 00:15:06.860
And so the reality is so long as life exists,

330
00:15:06.890 --> 00:15:10.280
even if it's just on earth and in the form of this ragtag band of heroes.

331
00:15:10.310 --> 00:15:12.620
So long as there a [inaudible] life in the universe,

332
00:15:12.710 --> 00:15:14.870
there can be dark multi-verse worlds.

333
00:15:14.960 --> 00:15:18.800
And so it doesn't really stand a reason here that it can kind of be cutoff in

334
00:15:18.801 --> 00:15:21.590
that way. But that kind of seems to be the line of logic that we're going with.

335
00:15:21.650 --> 00:15:23.090
That seems to be the direction that DC is going in.

336
00:15:23.091 --> 00:15:24.860
And maybe I missed something, but in my mind,

337
00:15:24.890 --> 00:15:28.250
it can't really seem to work that way. Right. That for any scenario,

338
00:15:28.251 --> 00:15:29.990
there's an infinite number of possibilities.

339
00:15:30.110 --> 00:15:33.440
It's the basis behind branch universe theory and how Marvel and DC handle their

340
00:15:33.441 --> 00:15:35.180
alternate realities. And so of course,

341
00:15:35.360 --> 00:15:37.490
what the destruction of all the life on the world perpetual was like,

342
00:15:37.520 --> 00:15:40.280
what in the heck is going on? Or at least, you know, that man who laughed,

343
00:15:40.281 --> 00:15:42.680
I was like, what's going on? And then of course he tries to leave perpetual,

344
00:15:42.681 --> 00:15:44.570
grabs him, snatches him back and says, Nope,

345
00:15:44.600 --> 00:15:46.130
you and I are going to finish this fight here.

346
00:15:46.190 --> 00:15:49.910
And so with what's left of these various superheroes, it's like, okay.

347
00:15:49.970 --> 00:15:52.580
And it's not just a, a band of like seven guys.

348
00:15:52.610 --> 00:15:55.820
It's seemingly all the superheroes and all the supervillains on earth that

349
00:15:55.821 --> 00:15:59.180
haven't died. So like all the major players, the, the suicide squad,

350
00:15:59.210 --> 00:16:02.660
the justice league, teen Titans, um, let's see like doom patrol,

351
00:16:02.690 --> 00:16:03.410
I think is on there.

352
00:16:03.410 --> 00:16:06.620
There's some alternate reality versions of superheroes that we're aware of.

353
00:16:06.650 --> 00:16:08.900
Right? So like you have the multi-vessel justice league,

354
00:16:09.080 --> 00:16:10.640
you've got a handful of other heroes who were here.

355
00:16:10.670 --> 00:16:14.180
The funny thing about this is that this is very much a crisis event and it's

356
00:16:14.181 --> 00:16:17.900
high time DC start calling it that, right. We know it is like, we've been,

357
00:16:17.930 --> 00:16:19.430
we've known this for a long time.

358
00:16:19.490 --> 00:16:22.760
This is very indicative of prices on infinite earths. And in fact,

359
00:16:22.761 --> 00:16:24.110
given all the various tie-ins here,

360
00:16:24.260 --> 00:16:27.110
which you had unofficial tie-ins to the crisis event, but given like all the,

361
00:16:27.111 --> 00:16:30.470
all the tie ins here, it's a much bigger version of crisis on infinite earths,

362
00:16:30.500 --> 00:16:33.470
but that's what this is. And so with this happening, basically,

363
00:16:33.471 --> 00:16:36.680
you kind of get this, this sort of a theorial void that begins to open up.

364
00:16:36.710 --> 00:16:38.360
And it allows all these, these, you know,

365
00:16:38.390 --> 00:16:42.020
worlds that Batman who laughs has been created to come pouring in right to come

366
00:16:42.021 --> 00:16:43.580
flying in towards the superheroes.

367
00:16:43.640 --> 00:16:46.670
And that's when the question's asked how many worlds do we have coming here?

368
00:16:46.671 --> 00:16:48.890
Because right now they can only really see three. And it's like, okay,

369
00:16:49.070 --> 00:16:51.350
we've got about three worlds coming. Right. You got one with wonder woman.

370
00:16:51.380 --> 00:16:54.140
You've got one with, you know, it looks like a dark version of the specter.

371
00:16:54.200 --> 00:16:56.270
Right? You've got another one with some guy who looks wild.

372
00:16:56.271 --> 00:16:58.940
I don't even know who that is. Right. But like, from there, it's like,

373
00:16:58.941 --> 00:17:02.120
it's a lot more than five. It's more than five it's dozens, right?

374
00:17:02.150 --> 00:17:04.790
Dozens and dozens of dark multi-verse worlds.

375
00:17:04.791 --> 00:17:08.390
And ultimately it doesn't look like the heroes are going to be able to survive

376
00:17:08.391 --> 00:17:10.070
this whole thing, which begs the question.

377
00:17:10.100 --> 00:17:12.050
How could they possibly come out on top?

378
00:17:12.080 --> 00:17:16.490
And I am excited to see how this whole thing ends. Well, that being said, guys,

379
00:17:16.550 --> 00:17:18.830
