4
00:00:11.280 --> 00:00:11.630
Okay.

5
00:00:11.630 --> 00:00:14.510
<v 1>What's going on guys? This is Rob and we're continuing DCC. Uh,</v>

6
00:00:14.540 --> 00:00:18.260
and in this one we are picking up with part five or whatever part this happens

7
00:00:18.261 --> 00:00:21.380
to be, but the, the DC's dead planet event. Right? So in this video,

8
00:00:21.381 --> 00:00:24.770
we pick up with John Constantine and Dr. Fate while they're heading into a

9
00:00:24.771 --> 00:00:28.100
really just Constantine heading into one of the doors of the tower of faint.

10
00:00:28.190 --> 00:00:30.740
And the funny thing about this is that he actually won't let Dr. Fait end,

11
00:00:30.770 --> 00:00:32.810
right? Because it's kind of like this door is closed. Uh,

12
00:00:32.900 --> 00:00:35.210
it's a private meeting home slice. You got to stay out here.

13
00:00:36.560 --> 00:00:38.840
And so once he actually gets inside, you know, because there's,

14
00:00:38.841 --> 00:00:42.320
there's not really a doorknob readily available for Dr. Fait to use Constantine

15
00:00:42.321 --> 00:00:44.360
kind of spawns. One goes inside and then shuts it.

16
00:00:44.450 --> 00:00:45.650
And of course the doorknob vanishes,

17
00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:49.070
but we ended up finding out inside this room is estrogen and estrogen.

18
00:00:49.080 --> 00:00:50.450
Of course, always speaking in rhymes,

19
00:00:50.480 --> 00:00:54.290
kind of follows up with the previous discussion they had about trigon coming to

20
00:00:54.291 --> 00:00:57.680
earth. And that when, when Constantine kind of asked for an update here, right?

21
00:00:57.681 --> 00:01:00.650
Like what's the update, like how long until trigon gets here.

22
00:01:00.810 --> 00:01:03.050
And the responsible estrogen is you have three days,

23
00:01:03.080 --> 00:01:06.770
you have three days until trigon makes his move and he comes to earth.

24
00:01:06.830 --> 00:01:10.100
And so it was kind of like, okay, now the other part of this is that the green,

25
00:01:10.400 --> 00:01:11.790
ah, this is being used by, you know, the,

26
00:01:11.791 --> 00:01:14.360
the ultra wealthy and powerful in order to spawn, you know,

27
00:01:14.361 --> 00:01:17.390
vegetables and things like that is still kind of off swamp thing. Right?

28
00:01:17.391 --> 00:01:19.700
So that needs to be dealt with, but the immediate threat,

29
00:01:19.730 --> 00:01:23.900
as far as Constantine is concerned, is to focus on essentially taking out the,

30
00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:26.450
uh, taking out, try again, or at least trying to find some way to defeat,

31
00:01:26.660 --> 00:01:27.980
try again, which is a tall order,

32
00:01:28.040 --> 00:01:31.100
even for the most powerful of beings inside of DC comics,

33
00:01:31.130 --> 00:01:34.400
let alone just John Constantine. Right? And so he takes a cloak of rag man,

34
00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:35.293
which as we know,

35
00:01:35.420 --> 00:01:38.690
had the ability to absorb the souls of other people and then leaves from there.

36
00:01:38.691 --> 00:01:41.750
He basically assembles what is for the most part, a strike team.

37
00:01:41.810 --> 00:01:44.420
And this strike team of course, is more or less being led by Batman,

38
00:01:44.421 --> 00:01:48.260
by Damian Wayne, uh, alongside, uh, Rose the daughter of Deathstroke.

39
00:01:48.320 --> 00:01:50.390
In addition to Jason Todd, and a few others. Now,

40
00:01:50.450 --> 00:01:53.600
the funny thing about this is that Rose and Jason Todd had actually gotten

41
00:01:53.601 --> 00:01:56.360
married. I don't like that. This just kind of happened off panel.

42
00:01:56.420 --> 00:01:59.900
I think it would have been cool to actually see how Rose and Jason Todd really

43
00:01:59.901 --> 00:02:00.680
began to hit it off,

44
00:02:00.680 --> 00:02:03.380
how that romance really began the blossom and how the two of them ended up

45
00:02:03.381 --> 00:02:03.950
getting married.

46
00:02:03.950 --> 00:02:07.070
It really kind of seemed to be Rose's clairvoyance that led to like, okay,

47
00:02:07.071 --> 00:02:09.950
we're going to get married because I saw it happening. So let's just do it now.

48
00:02:10.010 --> 00:02:12.980
And then they did. So I don't really know,

49
00:02:13.010 --> 00:02:16.880
but the important thing here is that what they ended up doing is transitioning,

50
00:02:17.030 --> 00:02:19.760
you know, to Nanda Parbat to basically, you know, well,

51
00:02:19.761 --> 00:02:21.440
really concentrating using the green to get there.

52
00:02:21.441 --> 00:02:23.810
And then of course the rest of them using a portal to access it.

53
00:02:23.840 --> 00:02:26.480
But with Nanda par bot, you know, essentially the league of assassins,

54
00:02:26.510 --> 00:02:28.250
more or less being infected here, uh,

55
00:02:28.280 --> 00:02:31.600
what you also have is just this colossal army. And th th the issue that,

56
00:02:31.601 --> 00:02:33.950
that you really have really kind of comes from Damian Wayne,

57
00:02:33.980 --> 00:02:37.460
which is really designed to sort of show how far he's come and the time that he

58
00:02:37.461 --> 00:02:40.640
took on the mantle of Batman versus when we first saw him in the sense that he

59
00:02:41.150 --> 00:02:43.940
maintains the ideology of Bruce Wayne, that if there's a cure here,

60
00:02:43.970 --> 00:02:45.320
that we cannot kill these people,

61
00:02:45.350 --> 00:02:49.160
like if there is a definitive cure and that you're a resides in the realm of the

62
00:02:49.161 --> 00:02:50.930
new gods or whatever it is, they have to do to get it.

63
00:02:50.960 --> 00:02:53.810
They can't kill everybody here because technically they be killing people who

64
00:02:53.811 --> 00:02:56.930
could be safe. And so it's, it's a bit murky here because in my mind,

65
00:02:56.931 --> 00:03:00.190
I would be like, no, I mean, you could save them, but if you guys die,

66
00:03:00.220 --> 00:03:03.040
the world's going to be destroyed by trigon. And so it's like, Hey, look,

67
00:03:03.041 --> 00:03:05.800
I'm sorry, all you innocent people, but our need is greater than yours.

68
00:03:05.830 --> 00:03:09.130
So we got to die, right? I mean, we won't intentionally kill you,

69
00:03:09.190 --> 00:03:10.870
but if you want up honest and you get in our way,

70
00:03:10.930 --> 00:03:12.940
then we're going to do you in that's, that's what I would do.

71
00:03:13.060 --> 00:03:15.140
But I'm also a little more hardcore, right? I mean, I'm,

72
00:03:15.141 --> 00:03:16.180
I'm a little more in the,

73
00:03:16.181 --> 00:03:20.230
I am in the philosophical views that the ends do justify the means,

74
00:03:20.350 --> 00:03:22.960
depending on what the ends are. Right. And so, because of that,

75
00:03:22.990 --> 00:03:25.000
you ended up seeing Rose, who basically, again,

76
00:03:25.001 --> 00:03:28.560
uses her kind of clairvoyance to sort of where she needs to go in order to,

77
00:03:28.561 --> 00:03:29.880
to get to where they need to be.

78
00:03:29.940 --> 00:03:32.790
And then basically knocks on the door and you end up being met by Boston brand

79
00:03:32.820 --> 00:03:33.960
by dead man. Right? He has,

80
00:03:33.961 --> 00:03:36.180
of course the ability to possess the bodies of others.

81
00:03:36.210 --> 00:03:39.720
And so as he opens the door, the forces of Nanga Parbat come pouring out.

82
00:03:39.750 --> 00:03:42.720
And then of course start attacking all these, these undead people who are here,

83
00:03:42.721 --> 00:03:43.680
right. Basically kind of, you know,

84
00:03:43.681 --> 00:03:47.730
taking care of them while Constantine heads inside Nanda Parbat meets with Rama

85
00:03:47.731 --> 00:03:50.610
Krishna and, and basically accesses the spear of destiny.

86
00:03:50.611 --> 00:03:54.300
Now [inaudible] is a being out there, um,

87
00:03:54.330 --> 00:03:58.230
who represents karma more or less. So she is in fact, a literal goddess.

88
00:03:58.290 --> 00:04:01.500
So killing her isn't necessarily something that can be done easily.

89
00:04:01.590 --> 00:04:05.070
The most powerful of beings out there can, but not everybody can, right. I mean,

90
00:04:05.071 --> 00:04:07.770
she gets, for the most part in immortal person, she could live on forever,

91
00:04:07.800 --> 00:04:11.010
but the spear of destiny is actually designed to kill a God. Right now.

92
00:04:11.100 --> 00:04:13.200
It doesn't mean he could stab her once and then she's dead.

93
00:04:13.320 --> 00:04:15.930
But the problem with this is that she won't let him take it.

94
00:04:16.020 --> 00:04:18.480
This is very much like a Holy figure. This is the Holy thing,

95
00:04:18.540 --> 00:04:21.510
the spear of destiny. You can't just take it and walk away with it.

96
00:04:21.570 --> 00:04:22.830
It doesn't work that way. And so,

97
00:04:22.831 --> 00:04:25.110
because of the fact that John Constantine knows this,

98
00:04:25.140 --> 00:04:28.080
he does the only thing that he can do. He stabs Rama Krishna,

99
00:04:28.110 --> 00:04:30.270
and then takes a spear of destiny for himself. Now,

100
00:04:30.450 --> 00:04:34.530
like immediately after that dead man shows up, like my God, what did you do?

101
00:04:34.890 --> 00:04:38.640
Goes to attack Constantine and Constantine absorbs dead man into the rag man

102
00:04:38.641 --> 00:04:41.070
cloak. So now Boston brand has gone, right? He's dead.

103
00:04:41.160 --> 00:04:44.100
He's effectively gone here. I mean, I guess not dead in the traditional sense,

104
00:04:44.160 --> 00:04:47.340
but by all standards of measurement is dead. Now, as far as Rama Krishna goes,

105
00:04:47.370 --> 00:04:49.830
she'll survive, right? I mean, she can't really be killed by that,

106
00:04:49.860 --> 00:04:52.860
but everybody's kind of to Constantine, but his whole, his whole stance here is,

107
00:04:52.920 --> 00:04:55.830
look, guys, Trigon's coming to earth and he's going to kill us.

108
00:04:55.860 --> 00:05:00.300
We don't really have time to play this game of what is the main thing to do.

109
00:05:00.301 --> 00:05:04.560
Constantine is just such a mean thing to do. We don't have time for that, right?

110
00:05:04.561 --> 00:05:06.450
Like this is the time to put up or shut up.

111
00:05:06.480 --> 00:05:09.720
And your morals are going to be questioned here. If you can't handle that leaf,

112
00:05:09.750 --> 00:05:13.500
right? Like this is not the time for why naivety and the idea of, well,

113
00:05:13.501 --> 00:05:16.290
we can save everybody's life is a time to do what you got to do.

114
00:05:16.440 --> 00:05:17.460
So if you can't man up,

115
00:05:17.490 --> 00:05:20.460
then go play with the kitties while the rest of us do what needs to be done.

116
00:05:20.490 --> 00:05:23.010
Right. It's, it's a, it's a time for men is a time for adults.

117
00:05:23.040 --> 00:05:26.160
It's a time for grown women to do what needs to be done in this situation.

118
00:05:26.490 --> 00:05:29.370
So following that, the end of transitioning to the rock of eternity,

119
00:05:29.430 --> 00:05:31.860
which is amazing, right? They get through here. Of course,

120
00:05:31.950 --> 00:05:34.020
you got the seven deadly sins, you know, all that kind of stuff.

121
00:05:34.050 --> 00:05:35.370
But as soon as they get in,

122
00:05:35.371 --> 00:05:36.960
and as soon as they get to where they're supposed to be,

123
00:05:36.990 --> 00:05:40.890
they're immediately met by, by Freddie Freeman, right by captain Marvel, Jr.

124
00:05:40.920 --> 00:05:44.100
Who literally goes on a rampage and just starts attacking all of them.

125
00:05:44.101 --> 00:05:45.240
Now in that process,

126
00:05:45.270 --> 00:05:48.380
you've also got the old wizard Shizam who seems to be infected,

127
00:05:48.440 --> 00:05:51.300
or the very least is just kind of living this, this terrible, horrible faith.

128
00:05:51.330 --> 00:05:52.680
And so what you end up having is Rose,

129
00:05:52.710 --> 00:05:56.010
who kills the old wizard shazamm by stabbing him to the head with a sword,

130
00:05:56.040 --> 00:05:59.060
when that happens and end up having like the staff of the old man,

131
00:05:59.061 --> 00:06:00.620
which is what they were there for that, uh,

132
00:06:00.790 --> 00:06:04.190
that Cassandra Cain is the one who picks it up at Cassandra Kane becomes the new

133
00:06:04.700 --> 00:06:04.730
Shizam.

134
00:06:04.730 --> 00:06:07.640
Now the funny thing about this is that with Freddie Freeman freaking out the way

135
00:06:07.641 --> 00:06:09.560
he is, her power is equal to hit.

136
00:06:09.590 --> 00:06:12.380
But one of the things that we're immediately told here is that Freddy Freeman

137
00:06:12.381 --> 00:06:15.560
was just an orphan kid who got the power of shazamm. He's not a fighter.

138
00:06:15.590 --> 00:06:17.900
Cassandra Kane has been fighting her entire life.

139
00:06:17.930 --> 00:06:21.890
And she was trained by the single greatest fighter in the entirety of DC comics.

140
00:06:21.920 --> 00:06:24.140
This is literally a girl born to kill, you know,

141
00:06:24.141 --> 00:06:27.140
who she was born and bred to kill anybody in her path.

142
00:06:27.170 --> 00:06:29.990
Her with the power of Shizam fighting off against Freddy Freeman.

143
00:06:30.080 --> 00:06:31.700
It wasn't even a contest.

144
00:06:31.730 --> 00:06:34.370
Pretty Freeman was dead before he even knew what happened.

145
00:06:34.400 --> 00:06:37.490
The problem with this is that when Freddie Freeman initially launched his

146
00:06:37.491 --> 00:06:40.580
attack, he immediately went for Jason Todd and crashed him into a wall.

147
00:06:40.670 --> 00:06:44.540
And when that happened, he killed Jason Todd, right? So Jason, Todd is now dead,

148
00:06:44.600 --> 00:06:47.900
which totally sucks. And so once they all basically ended up getting back there,

149
00:06:47.901 --> 00:06:51.290
of course they bring Jason Todd's body, Batman freaks out, and he's like, dude,

150
00:06:51.330 --> 00:06:54.380
you know, this, this is ridiculous, right? Like you got, you got, you got Jason,

151
00:06:54.381 --> 00:06:57.620
Todd killed here. But at the end of the day, it was a small price to pay,

152
00:06:57.650 --> 00:07:00.290
to save the earth, right? I mean, that's kind of the nature of the beast.

153
00:07:00.320 --> 00:07:04.280
If these people out here really can be saved, then Jason, Todd, Jason, Todd,

154
00:07:04.370 --> 00:07:04.640
his death,

155
00:07:04.640 --> 00:07:08.600
while tragic pales in comparison to the billions of lives out there that could

156
00:07:08.601 --> 00:07:10.880
be spared. It's simple utilitarianism,

157
00:07:10.940 --> 00:07:13.250
the needs of the many outweigh the needs of the few.

158
00:07:13.370 --> 00:07:16.370
And so what you end up getting is this kind of disembodied voice that tells John

159
00:07:16.371 --> 00:07:19.430
Constantine, you deserve that, right? You deserve to get punched in the face,

160
00:07:19.431 --> 00:07:21.350
the way that you did by Batman because of what you've done.

161
00:07:21.380 --> 00:07:24.320
And we end up finding out this voice is coming from Jim Corrigan.

162
00:07:24.440 --> 00:07:26.780
This voice is coming directly from the specter.

163
00:07:26.810 --> 00:07:28.610
And when you have Constantine talking to him,

164
00:07:28.730 --> 00:07:30.980
the specter is good ghost of wrath, things that, you know,

165
00:07:30.981 --> 00:07:33.050
things I deserve the punch in the face, huge deal.

166
00:07:33.051 --> 00:07:34.070
And he basically tells him like,

167
00:07:34.071 --> 00:07:37.430
you're holding an object that could end even me. Right. That's concerning.

168
00:07:37.490 --> 00:07:39.860
And I can stop you from what you're doing.

169
00:07:39.861 --> 00:07:42.860
Constantine and Constantine's responses. You could write your,

170
00:07:42.861 --> 00:07:46.610
the spirit of engines. You could kill me and everybody here, but ask yourself,

171
00:07:46.760 --> 00:07:47.750
you ask yourself this question.

172
00:07:47.780 --> 00:07:51.530
If I would go to these lengths to attain weapons that could kill gods.

173
00:07:51.560 --> 00:07:53.390
Don't you think there's a reason why?

174
00:07:53.480 --> 00:07:56.270
And Corgan kind of looks at him for a second and says, yeah, you're right.

175
00:07:56.271 --> 00:07:59.440
And then leaves. That's kind of the funny thing here.

176
00:07:59.470 --> 00:08:01.870
And this is something that I, I actually like about what's going on with,

177
00:08:01.871 --> 00:08:05.680
with DC stead planet chemically, Jim Corgan could just purify the earth, right.

178
00:08:05.681 --> 00:08:07.780
And just be done with it. He could purify all these people.

179
00:08:07.781 --> 00:08:11.650
He could kill them all and their souls would pass onto Trigon's Rome and try and

180
00:08:11.651 --> 00:08:13.620
wouldn't really have any reason to invade earth anymore.

181
00:08:13.780 --> 00:08:16.810
It could all just be ended by vector, but it's cool that he's not,

182
00:08:16.900 --> 00:08:17.641
it's cool that,

183
00:08:17.641 --> 00:08:21.580
that this is not being invoked by up by DC because it would be lazy and it would

184
00:08:21.581 --> 00:08:23.740
be an easy way out. It would be super lazy if he's just like,

185
00:08:23.760 --> 00:08:27.580
if it's like wipes, his hands wages and he's dead done day saved. Thanks,

186
00:08:27.581 --> 00:08:30.640
Jim Corgan. Let's meet up for beers and hot dogs, you know?

187
00:08:30.641 --> 00:08:33.370
And that's that's it, but it would just be kind of land, right? It would,

188
00:08:33.371 --> 00:08:36.640
it would be, it would be pretty lame, but I love what DC's doing here. Now,

189
00:08:36.700 --> 00:08:37.690
if I'm a betting, man,

190
00:08:37.750 --> 00:08:41.260
I think Jim Corgan is going to have a much bigger role to play and the events of

191
00:08:41.261 --> 00:08:45.100
DCC. But for now, it's cool to see that he's not being used as an easy way out.

192
00:08:45.190 --> 00:08:47.230
Well, that being said, guys, we're going to be this video to an end.

193
00:08:47.290 --> 00:08:48.123
If you are new here,

194
00:08:48.190 --> 00:08:50.470
