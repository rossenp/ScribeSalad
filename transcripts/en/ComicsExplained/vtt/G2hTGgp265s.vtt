4
00:00:11.100 --> 00:00:12.300
What's going on guys. This is.

5
00:00:12.410 --> 00:00:16.400
<v 1>Rob and we are picking back up again with tales from the dark multiverse.</v>

6
00:00:16.460 --> 00:00:19.220
This time we're focusing on flashpoint.

7
00:00:19.250 --> 00:00:22.280
So a little bit of an explanation here for people who are not familiar with the

8
00:00:22.850 --> 00:00:23.420
flashpoint story.

9
00:00:23.420 --> 00:00:26.600
My flash point is probably one of the most important stories of DC's done in a

10
00:00:26.601 --> 00:00:29.960
long, long time, because that's the story that kicked off the new 52.

11
00:00:30.200 --> 00:00:32.870
So the way this initially played out to kind of give a really quick rundown

12
00:00:32.871 --> 00:00:36.050
explanation, and I believe that we did cover flashpoint on the channel.

13
00:00:36.080 --> 00:00:38.120
So it should be down in the description if we did.

14
00:00:38.150 --> 00:00:41.120
But the idea here is that at some point along the line,

15
00:00:41.180 --> 00:00:45.710
very Alan decided to go back into the past and save his mom from dying at the

16
00:00:45.711 --> 00:00:49.070
hands of ear barred thought. And the, the idea of barriers that if he did that,

17
00:00:49.130 --> 00:00:51.860
then basically everything would happen the same way that it always did.

18
00:00:51.860 --> 00:00:53.720
Except now he'd have his mom in his life.

19
00:00:53.750 --> 00:00:56.000
The exact opposite happened that with Barry Allen's,

20
00:00:56.510 --> 00:00:59.840
mom's basically surviving the, what it led to was the flashpoint universe.

21
00:00:59.841 --> 00:01:00.531
It had this great big,

22
00:01:00.531 --> 00:01:04.430
huge series of effects on the timeline so that when Joe chill went to go murder

23
00:01:04.431 --> 00:01:07.910
Thomas and Martha Wayne in crime alley, he actually shot Bruce Wayne in step.

24
00:01:07.970 --> 00:01:11.810
And Thomas Wayne became Batman and Martha Wayne became the joker that you ended

25
00:01:11.811 --> 00:01:15.410
up having a war that broke out between the Atlantean and the a and the Amazons.

26
00:01:15.470 --> 00:01:18.980
And that that's kind of been going on ever since Superman was taken by the

27
00:01:18.981 --> 00:01:20.450
government, right? As soon as he landed on earth,

28
00:01:20.480 --> 00:01:23.540
he was taken by the government. So he's never seen any kind of civilization.

29
00:01:23.570 --> 00:01:26.450
There's no Superman Lois lane. There's, there's none of that stuff,

30
00:01:26.630 --> 00:01:29.270
but it's just a really, really twisted and dark universe. Now,

31
00:01:29.330 --> 00:01:32.720
the way this worked out was that very Alan's powers were initially lost to him.

32
00:01:32.721 --> 00:01:36.160
And then ultimately he gained them back and then basically went back in time and

33
00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:39.530
allowed his mom to die. And that kind of reset the timeline so to speak,

34
00:01:39.590 --> 00:01:41.690
but it led into the creation of the new 52, right?

35
00:01:41.750 --> 00:01:42.980
It was basically DC rebooting.

36
00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:46.550
And so what this does is this picks up in that moment when Barry Allen and

37
00:01:46.551 --> 00:01:49.490
Thomas Wayne were jump-starting very Allen's powers, right?

38
00:01:49.491 --> 00:01:52.040
When they were basically getting his powers back in, back in the pike.

39
00:01:52.070 --> 00:01:54.290
So he could basically kind of figure out what's going on.

40
00:01:54.320 --> 00:01:56.870
You'll face off against ear farm when he made his presence known.

41
00:01:56.930 --> 00:01:59.450
And then of course go back in time and let his mom die.

42
00:01:59.540 --> 00:02:01.610
The difference here is that when that happens,

43
00:02:01.640 --> 00:02:05.150
that ear Bard thought actually seems to strike that when Barry Allen does this,

44
00:02:05.151 --> 00:02:07.520
that ear, Bart is just kind of running through the time stream.

45
00:02:07.550 --> 00:02:10.490
But as Barry Allen's powers, come back to him, this kind of quote,

46
00:02:10.820 --> 00:02:11.690
unquote lightning strike, right?

47
00:02:11.691 --> 00:02:15.380
The speed force basically ends up throwing e-board fawn into the flashpoint

48
00:02:15.381 --> 00:02:18.920
universe. And when he arrives here, he immediately kills Barry Allen, right?

49
00:02:18.921 --> 00:02:21.020
Just like that, very Alan's gone. And so he,

50
00:02:21.230 --> 00:02:23.480
barred fawn is the only speedster in this universe.

51
00:02:23.540 --> 00:02:26.570
And what's kind of crazy about this is he looks at Barry and he says, man, like,

52
00:02:26.571 --> 00:02:27.800
this is kind of wild, but,

53
00:02:27.830 --> 00:02:31.220
but fate seems to have more or less stepped in with regards to EMR on arriving

54
00:02:31.221 --> 00:02:34.610
here, Barry Allen being killed. And at that point he barred fonts kind of like,

55
00:02:34.640 --> 00:02:35.091
okay, well,

56
00:02:35.091 --> 00:02:38.510
if my existence was always tied into the idea of like being better than you

57
00:02:38.511 --> 00:02:40.820
defeating you, you know, not necessarily killing you,

58
00:02:40.821 --> 00:02:43.670
but I guess ultimately doing it one day and now Barry, Allen's dead.

59
00:02:44.120 --> 00:02:46.670
E-board fun is kind of free. Right. It's kind of like, okay,

60
00:02:46.700 --> 00:02:49.520
so I can just kind of do my thing in this place. Now,

61
00:02:49.550 --> 00:02:51.680
Thomas Wayne immediately attacks him. Right?

62
00:02:51.681 --> 00:02:53.090
Thomas Wayne immediately goes after him.

63
00:02:53.150 --> 00:02:56.510
And then he Bartholin goes after Thomas Wayne. But as he does,

64
00:02:56.511 --> 00:02:59.890
he begins to pick up on the memories and the thoughts, the feelings of,

65
00:02:59.891 --> 00:03:00.730
of Bruce, I'm sorry,

66
00:03:00.820 --> 00:03:04.870
of Thomas Wayne and realizes he's not in the main DC universe from [inaudible]

67
00:03:04.871 --> 00:03:07.660
perspective. This is just the main DC universe. Right. Very analyst debt.

68
00:03:07.661 --> 00:03:09.670
And it's like, wow, cool, awesome. But now that he learns,

69
00:03:09.700 --> 00:03:13.360
it's an alternate reality where Bruce Wayne died instead of Thomas and Martha,

70
00:03:13.390 --> 00:03:16.750
the things are totally different here. The things are darkly arrived.

71
00:03:16.780 --> 00:03:20.350
And that's when he says like, this world is a gift. There's no real hope here.

72
00:03:20.410 --> 00:03:22.720
Right? Like things are pretty bad. Things are pretty gloomy.

73
00:03:22.960 --> 00:03:25.900
And I can build on that. Right. I can take this world and make it my own.

74
00:03:26.080 --> 00:03:27.610
There's no unified justice league.

75
00:03:27.640 --> 00:03:29.590
The superheroes who are here are scattered in,

76
00:03:29.591 --> 00:03:31.360
divided the warring against one another.

77
00:03:31.390 --> 00:03:33.550
There's no one to really challenge me in this place.

78
00:03:33.640 --> 00:03:34.750
And so with that being the case,

79
00:03:34.751 --> 00:03:37.870
we basically jumped over to Washington DC with the president of the United

80
00:03:37.870 --> 00:03:39.510
States. And the president being here is,

81
00:03:39.640 --> 00:03:42.100
it's kind of interesting because EMR thought basically took off where we don't

82
00:03:42.101 --> 00:03:44.500
really know where he went to. But the president being here is this,

83
00:03:44.740 --> 00:03:46.720
guy's basically just kind of a coward. These basically scared.

84
00:03:46.721 --> 00:03:48.190
He's scared to death of the IDF,

85
00:03:48.230 --> 00:03:50.440
the Amazons and the Atlantean are going to go to war. They're going to,

86
00:03:50.650 --> 00:03:51.760
or at least they had been at war.

87
00:03:51.820 --> 00:03:54.640
Other that one of them who will eventually conquer the United States, right.

88
00:03:54.641 --> 00:03:57.730
Because the us doesn't really have the ability to stand against that kind of

89
00:03:57.760 --> 00:04:00.340
power. But then in the middle of all of this, right? When,

90
00:04:00.341 --> 00:04:01.121
when the president's like,

91
00:04:01.121 --> 00:04:04.270
we don't have anybody that can stand against that kind of power, EMR,

92
00:04:04.300 --> 00:04:05.920
Dawn smashes, the doors open, right.

93
00:04:05.921 --> 00:04:09.100
Just goes ripping through and just starts taking out everybody. Right? Like,

94
00:04:09.101 --> 00:04:11.650
like everybody who's here, the green lantern and the whole nine yards,

95
00:04:11.680 --> 00:04:16.240
they all fall before EMR thumb because you can move faster than they can fake at

96
00:04:16.241 --> 00:04:18.010
that point. There's really not much they can do.

97
00:04:18.100 --> 00:04:20.410
And when he sends cyborg flying out of the place, right,

98
00:04:20.500 --> 00:04:23.190
this isn't him flying out of the oval. That's what he tells the president.

99
00:04:23.370 --> 00:04:25.470
I created you. You're here because of me.

100
00:04:25.680 --> 00:04:28.050
And we end up finding out that the way this was supposed to play out.

101
00:04:28.051 --> 00:04:31.200
And the reason why the president here is different than he was in the original

102
00:04:31.201 --> 00:04:35.040
flashpoint story is because he thought and went into the past and then basically

103
00:04:35.041 --> 00:04:38.550
set things up. So this guy would become president of the United States. Right?

104
00:04:38.670 --> 00:04:40.380
Initially he was a soap opera actor.

105
00:04:40.410 --> 00:04:43.170
This guy had no business ever becoming president of the United States,

106
00:04:43.350 --> 00:04:45.360
but he dead right ear. Bardon kind of made it happen.

107
00:04:45.390 --> 00:04:49.050
And the reason why is because this guy's cowardice is such to where he'll do

108
00:04:49.200 --> 00:04:52.020
anything to make sure everything's okay, right? I mean,

109
00:04:52.021 --> 00:04:55.350
this guy is terrified of confrontation. That kind of stuff. Now cyborg,

110
00:04:55.590 --> 00:04:59.280
just jump back in. But he's atomized by, uh, by EMR thought almost immediately.

111
00:04:59.400 --> 00:05:01.800
But the reason why he comes to me is he basically says like, you're,

112
00:05:01.801 --> 00:05:02.634
you're a weak man,

113
00:05:02.700 --> 00:05:06.030
but you are a weak man who is put into a wildly powerful position.

114
00:05:06.090 --> 00:05:10.080
You will basically do anything I tell you to. And if I tell you that I can,

115
00:05:10.470 --> 00:05:13.140
it's a war between the Amazons and the Atlanteans.

116
00:05:13.460 --> 00:05:17.130
If I can that conflict and keep America shore safe, that in turn,

117
00:05:17.190 --> 00:05:19.920
I want the United States, I want to, I want to own America.

118
00:05:19.950 --> 00:05:22.650
You can keep running it. Right. That's fun. Do whatever you want with it.

119
00:05:22.651 --> 00:05:25.530
But I want to be the one that basically owns it right when I come into the oval

120
00:05:25.531 --> 00:05:29.010
office and I tell you that something done, that thing gets done, right?

121
00:05:29.130 --> 00:05:31.740
Like that's, that's what he's shooting for now while all that's happening.

122
00:05:31.741 --> 00:05:34.890
Because of the fact that the president basically allies himself with [inaudible]

123
00:05:34.920 --> 00:05:37.140
and says, you know, this guy calls himself the flash that he's got,

124
00:05:37.141 --> 00:05:40.710
the power that this power that he has will basically save us the United States

125
00:05:40.711 --> 00:05:43.140
more or less rallies under him. Not a lot of people questioned him.

126
00:05:43.141 --> 00:05:45.510
And the reason why is that in times of day, Spiration,

127
00:05:45.600 --> 00:05:48.240
people will believe what they want to believe. Logic and reason.

128
00:05:48.270 --> 00:05:49.710
They both go out the window, right?

129
00:05:49.711 --> 00:05:52.200
People just believe what makes them feel happy? Well,

130
00:05:52.201 --> 00:05:55.320
it makes them feel more comfortable. Now that's bad. That's a terrible,

131
00:05:55.321 --> 00:05:58.670
terrible philosophy to have, but it's just how human beings are. Right.

132
00:05:58.790 --> 00:06:00.170
It's how we as people are. The,

133
00:06:00.171 --> 00:06:02.990
the important thing is that while Thomas is watching all that one thing to

134
00:06:02.991 --> 00:06:05.780
understand, Barry is not going to come back, right? Very Alan's death.

135
00:06:05.900 --> 00:06:08.450
There is no resurrection for him and any real form or fashion,

136
00:06:08.480 --> 00:06:12.010
but Batman gets a message from Victor stone who backed up his brain,

137
00:06:12.040 --> 00:06:15.610
basically revealing to him. The Superman project. Now the Superman project,

138
00:06:15.611 --> 00:06:17.050
as we talked about kind of a little bit ago,

139
00:06:17.080 --> 00:06:19.480
was the idea that when Superman landed on earth,

140
00:06:19.481 --> 00:06:21.730
he was taken by the federal government and then tested,

141
00:06:21.731 --> 00:06:24.910
examined all that kind of stuff, but never became the Superman that,

142
00:06:25.060 --> 00:06:28.120
that we know why the guy who basically leaves superheroes into a better

143
00:06:28.121 --> 00:06:29.830
tomorrow, right here, United superheroes,

144
00:06:29.860 --> 00:06:31.660
all under this idea that they could become better.

145
00:06:31.660 --> 00:06:35.560
People that's Superman does not exist, right? No one's ever heard of him before.

146
00:06:35.770 --> 00:06:38.950
No one knows he exists. Right? There is just one of these things. We're just,

147
00:06:39.430 --> 00:06:41.140
nobody's aware that it's there. Now, the funny thing about that,

148
00:06:41.141 --> 00:06:43.780
this is one of the things that I love the most about EMR thought is when you

149
00:06:44.320 --> 00:06:46.300
transition back to him and he's talking to them president,

150
00:06:46.301 --> 00:06:48.670
and that eventually transitions and talks to Thomas Wayne,

151
00:06:48.700 --> 00:06:50.230
that he kind of gives us this really,

152
00:06:50.231 --> 00:06:53.440
really cool breakdown perception of Barry Allen,

153
00:06:53.470 --> 00:06:57.370
how it is that he truly sees Barry Allen, because more often than not,

154
00:06:57.371 --> 00:07:00.280
whenever we see IA, Bardon discussing the nature of Berry,

155
00:07:00.340 --> 00:07:03.310
it's usually done with regards to his desire to take Barry Allen down.

156
00:07:03.340 --> 00:07:05.260
But because of the fact that Barry Allen's now dead,

157
00:07:05.320 --> 00:07:07.570
that is kind of how he Bardon really views him.

158
00:07:07.630 --> 00:07:10.180
And it's not really anything honorable, like, you know, very aloe.

159
00:07:10.390 --> 00:07:12.190
Wasn't the greatest man I ever met in the suction. He died.

160
00:07:12.250 --> 00:07:13.420
It's not really anything like that.

161
00:07:13.421 --> 00:07:16.000
Instead of he considers Barry Allen to be a selfish person, right.

162
00:07:16.001 --> 00:07:18.850
A very Island to kind of be no measure of a superhero at all.

163
00:07:18.940 --> 00:07:23.350
And he actually is not wrong here. Right? He's, he's really not wrong.

164
00:07:23.380 --> 00:07:26.260
And that's, what's so, so interesting because he kind of breaks it down.

165
00:07:26.290 --> 00:07:26.620
He says,

166
00:07:26.620 --> 00:07:30.760
for all the superhero antics that Barry Allen engaged in at the end of the day,

167
00:07:30.910 --> 00:07:33.730
he ran back in time and save his mom's life. He's like I,

168
00:07:33.731 --> 00:07:36.610
as the reverse flash understand the time is a nuance thing.

169
00:07:36.670 --> 00:07:38.200
It's almost like threading a needle, right?

170
00:07:38.201 --> 00:07:42.220
You can't just go lumbering in there like a bull in a China shop and just start

171
00:07:42.221 --> 00:07:43.360
doing what it is that you want to do,

172
00:07:43.390 --> 00:07:45.370
because it's going to have effects on time.

173
00:07:45.400 --> 00:07:48.100
You have to understand how time works before you manipulate it.

174
00:07:48.101 --> 00:07:52.060
Barry Allen did not know and did not care in all reality that very Alan cared

175
00:07:52.061 --> 00:07:53.470
nothing about the nuance of time.

176
00:07:53.830 --> 00:07:56.500
Barry Allen decided that one day he's going to save his mom's life.

177
00:07:56.680 --> 00:08:00.130
And so he just ran back through time and he saved his mom's life with no thought

178
00:08:00.131 --> 00:08:02.620
to the consequences of the actions that he was engaging in,

179
00:08:02.650 --> 00:08:05.020
not just in so far as how it would affect his life,

180
00:08:05.050 --> 00:08:09.160
but how would it affect everybody else's life around him and what it led to was

181
00:08:09.161 --> 00:08:11.800
this terrible, horrible world that you guys live in right now,

182
00:08:11.860 --> 00:08:13.420
Barry Allen created that.

183
00:08:13.450 --> 00:08:15.970
And it's one of these things where Batman kind of challenges them a little bit

184
00:08:15.971 --> 00:08:17.920
and says, you know, okay, well then here's my question.

185
00:08:18.170 --> 00:08:19.390
What you're telling me here,

186
00:08:19.420 --> 00:08:23.950
your entire existence was based around the notion of Barry Allen living.

187
00:08:23.980 --> 00:08:26.170
So what's the purpose of your existence now, right?

188
00:08:26.320 --> 00:08:29.620
What's the purpose behind your life? Why do you even exist anymore?

189
00:08:29.650 --> 00:08:32.350
And it's almost kind of like ear barred fonts thrown into this existential

190
00:08:32.351 --> 00:08:35.650
crisis. And instead of answering the question he deflects and he's like, well,

191
00:08:35.651 --> 00:08:37.300
what about you, Thomas Wayne, look at you. You know, like,

192
00:08:37.330 --> 00:08:39.310
all you're doing now is you're not a hero, right?

193
00:08:39.340 --> 00:08:42.130
You're not trying to save the world or even your city.

194
00:08:42.160 --> 00:08:45.460
You're just a man obsessed with destroying criminals, screaming at the world,

195
00:08:45.490 --> 00:08:47.860
making it pay for your pain. That's all you really are.

196
00:08:47.890 --> 00:08:50.320
The funny thing about that is that's Bruce Wayne and that's,

197
00:08:50.321 --> 00:08:53.140
what's kind of interesting is that Bruce and Thomas are very similar in that

198
00:08:53.141 --> 00:08:56.520
regard. And the, the, the whole gist behind is that you kind of get this,

199
00:08:56.521 --> 00:09:00.630
this interesting situation where Thomas Wayne is like, okay.

200
00:09:00.690 --> 00:09:05.260
So Barry Allen told me [inaudible] came from a time. Or at least the, the,

201
00:09:05.261 --> 00:09:09.920
the world that Barry Allen came from that Bruce Wayne survived and myself and

202
00:09:09.930 --> 00:09:10.763
Martha Wayne died.

203
00:09:10.800 --> 00:09:14.430
And like any father they'd want their children to survive before themselves.

204
00:09:14.431 --> 00:09:15.840
Right. Especially somebody as young as Bruce,

205
00:09:15.841 --> 00:09:18.390
because he never got a chance to live a life. And so because of that,

206
00:09:18.391 --> 00:09:21.930
Thomas Wayne kind of starts mulling this over when Ybarra fawns starts kicking

207
00:09:21.931 --> 00:09:23.070
off the idea of, Hey,

208
00:09:23.130 --> 00:09:27.030
I can go back and I can fix things in this universe so that your son never died.

209
00:09:27.090 --> 00:09:30.270
So that Martha never goes in same so that you never have to become Batman.

210
00:09:30.300 --> 00:09:33.210
You guys can live the life that you always imagine, you guys living,

211
00:09:33.300 --> 00:09:35.760
I can make that happen. And when Thomas is kind of like, well,

212
00:09:35.761 --> 00:09:37.890
then will you do it right? Will you save them? Will you bring my,

213
00:09:37.920 --> 00:09:41.040
will you bring my boy back? The responsible EBAC thrawn is not a chance,

214
00:09:41.100 --> 00:09:44.730
but I could, but I'm not going to, and I'm not going to because I don't have to.

215
00:09:45.000 --> 00:09:47.730
Right. And then just leaves. There's not a single hope out there.

216
00:09:48.030 --> 00:09:51.450
That's not going to happen. But Thomas Wayne hopes that it could happen. Now,

217
00:09:51.451 --> 00:09:53.100
there are two main things that happen here, right?

218
00:09:53.101 --> 00:09:54.210
Two main things that come out of this,

219
00:09:54.240 --> 00:09:57.540
the first is that looking at the nature between [inaudible] Fon and Barry Allen,

220
00:09:57.570 --> 00:09:59.910
that [inaudible] chased Allen, he chased Barry out.

221
00:09:59.990 --> 00:10:01.890
And the reason why was because he had his own motivations, right.

222
00:10:01.891 --> 00:10:04.140
Trying to become better, trying to prove, you know, whatever it was.

223
00:10:04.141 --> 00:10:07.290
But he was obsessed with, with Barry out. The fact that Barry Allen is dead,

224
00:10:07.291 --> 00:10:10.350
basically left ear barred, kind of out there trying to figure himself out.

225
00:10:10.380 --> 00:10:14.010
And what he does is he reverts back to what he knows by presenting Thomas Wayne,

226
00:10:14.011 --> 00:10:17.400
with the possibility that he could save his family and then choosing not to

227
00:10:17.460 --> 00:10:19.980
Thomas Wayne will become obsessed with that idea.

228
00:10:20.040 --> 00:10:21.660
And he will chase down EMR thought.

229
00:10:21.690 --> 00:10:26.340
And so basically [inaudible] now has his own version of quote-unquote EMR

230
00:10:26.341 --> 00:10:29.580
thought a person obsessed with him for the purpose of trying to achieve a

231
00:10:29.581 --> 00:10:30.360
particular goal.

232
00:10:30.360 --> 00:10:33.390
The second thing that comes out of this is that we're kind of presented with

233
00:10:33.391 --> 00:10:37.500
this idea. That hope is not simply just a concept. Hope is a tangible thing,

234
00:10:37.740 --> 00:10:39.810
right? Hope is a, is a realistic, tangible thing.

235
00:10:39.811 --> 00:10:42.540
You can't necessarily touch it, but it's palpable, right?

236
00:10:42.600 --> 00:10:45.930
That the way in which the world functions right now is because it's a world with

237
00:10:45.931 --> 00:10:46.764
no real hope,

238
00:10:46.770 --> 00:10:50.520
but as hope begins to grow in this world from various people due to various

239
00:10:50.521 --> 00:10:53.910
circumstances, the world can actually become a better place.

240
00:10:53.940 --> 00:10:57.060
What you end up doing is switching over to metropolis about 200 meters below

241
00:10:57.061 --> 00:10:58.140
ground with cyberwar,

242
00:10:58.170 --> 00:11:00.990
who's kind of put his mind inside of a robot body and Thomas Wayne.

243
00:11:01.110 --> 00:11:04.080
And they're basically traveling to meet with, meet with Superman, right?

244
00:11:04.081 --> 00:11:06.810
To see Superman for the very first time and to basically release him.

245
00:11:06.840 --> 00:11:10.230
The other part of this is that Ebert Vaughn is finally maintaining his promise

246
00:11:10.260 --> 00:11:13.050
after about a week to end the war between the Atlanteans and the,

247
00:11:13.051 --> 00:11:16.140
and the Amazons. The first thing he does is he kills Aquaman, right?

248
00:11:16.141 --> 00:11:17.160
He basically says like, you know,

249
00:11:17.190 --> 00:11:20.070
I had believed that the Amazonian queen would be more reasonable,

250
00:11:20.130 --> 00:11:22.770
but this is a gift, right? You just came assuming,

251
00:11:23.070 --> 00:11:26.490
presumably running at me with all the power and all the strength that you had.

252
00:11:26.550 --> 00:11:29.280
And there's just, there's nothing you could really do. I've killed you. Now.

253
00:11:29.340 --> 00:11:33.720
I can basically use you as a means to broker peace between wonder woman and the

254
00:11:34.380 --> 00:11:36.780
Atlantans. And so what he does is he grabs the body of,

255
00:11:36.781 --> 00:11:40.800
of Aquaman and then brings it to wonder woman drops it off in front of her and

256
00:11:40.801 --> 00:11:44.220
says, this is a warning. You and your old gods are all finished,

257
00:11:44.250 --> 00:11:47.700
but you guys are all done. America is mine. If you come here,

258
00:11:47.760 --> 00:11:50.310
if you come to the United States, I will kill you all.

259
00:11:50.460 --> 00:11:52.740
I will take all of you out. This is your warning.

260
00:11:52.830 --> 00:11:56.260
There not be another one do not come here, stay away.

261
00:11:56.320 --> 00:11:59.020
And it's kind of nuts because it basically seems to essentially end the

262
00:11:59.021 --> 00:12:02.860
conflict. Like just like that. The war is basically done. Not from there.

263
00:12:02.861 --> 00:12:06.160
It switches back over to a, to Thomas Lane and the sideboard.

264
00:12:06.190 --> 00:12:08.500
And we end up finding out that with Superman being freed, of course,

265
00:12:08.501 --> 00:12:10.780
because of the fact that it's kind of interesting thing that was covered here,

266
00:12:11.020 --> 00:12:13.870
uh, with Superman, despite not having ever really met any human beings.

267
00:12:13.900 --> 00:12:17.710
The overall gist is that DC kind of ties into the nature of Superman as being a

268
00:12:17.711 --> 00:12:20.560
hopeful person. Superman likes to believe in the best of people.

269
00:12:20.590 --> 00:12:23.560
And the results of this is that given the various psychological tests that were

270
00:12:23.561 --> 00:12:26.980
done by a done on him by the federal government, Superman desire's friends.

271
00:12:27.010 --> 00:12:30.070
And so with cyborg and Thomas Wayne presumed themselves as friends,

272
00:12:30.190 --> 00:12:32.620
or they in turn managed to get them out, right. That's why he didn't Superman.

273
00:12:32.630 --> 00:12:35.200
Didn't just immediately attack them because he was afraid of them or something

274
00:12:35.201 --> 00:12:36.940
like that. I'm sure some of you guys are going to ask that.

275
00:12:36.970 --> 00:12:38.470
And that's why I thought it was important to mention,

276
00:12:38.500 --> 00:12:42.610
but basically he's just been sitting here absorbing solar radiation for like

277
00:12:42.611 --> 00:12:46.030
five days, every single minute out in the daylight. And that's it, right?

278
00:12:46.031 --> 00:12:48.550
Like every single minute of daylight for five days, he just hangs there,

279
00:12:48.610 --> 00:12:50.770
absorbing all that energy. Now of course,

280
00:12:50.890 --> 00:12:54.010
it's him basically bolstering his abilities, but still right as Superman,

281
00:12:54.011 --> 00:12:55.810
who's wildly formidable from there.

282
00:12:55.811 --> 00:12:58.000
What you end up getting is kind of like this, this,

283
00:12:58.120 --> 00:13:00.970
these Atlantean shifts that are just sort of sitting out there right now,

284
00:13:00.971 --> 00:13:05.230
a plan was formulated between Superman and between cyborg and Thomas Wayne.

285
00:13:05.260 --> 00:13:07.120
But we didn't really know exactly what that plan was.

286
00:13:07.150 --> 00:13:10.480
Instead when Eve Arthur's attention is drawn to these Atlantean,

287
00:13:10.650 --> 00:13:11.590
these Atlantean ships,

288
00:13:11.620 --> 00:13:14.440
they're just kind of sitting out there suddenly he's attacked by Superman.

289
00:13:14.560 --> 00:13:15.640
And as far as I'm aware,

290
00:13:15.670 --> 00:13:19.480
this is the first time we really get to see a one-on-one fight between Superman.

291
00:13:19.570 --> 00:13:22.990
And [inaudible] what makes it even more interesting is it's flashpoint,

292
00:13:22.991 --> 00:13:26.290
Superman versus Ybarra. I thought that's what makes this really, really,

293
00:13:26.291 --> 00:13:30.550
really cool is because this is not like the wildly experienced knows exactly how

294
00:13:30.551 --> 00:13:33.340
to handle [inaudible] version of Superman. They've never met right now.

295
00:13:33.341 --> 00:13:36.520
This was a year and facing off against Superman in the DC universe because of

296
00:13:36.521 --> 00:13:40.630
the fact that thought is a, is a huge enemy. Like the, the main enemy of, uh,

297
00:13:40.631 --> 00:13:43.240
of Barry Allen, right? His, his arch arch arch nemesis.

298
00:13:43.300 --> 00:13:46.600
And because of the fact that she ran has had dealings with EMR [inaudible] in

299
00:13:46.601 --> 00:13:49.240
the past, he would know exactly how to handle this situation,

300
00:13:49.270 --> 00:13:51.970
but we don't get that here. Instead, we kind of have EMR Dawn.

301
00:13:52.000 --> 00:13:54.820
Who's really sort of analyzing the nature of Superman and kind of looking at

302
00:13:54.821 --> 00:13:56.890
this and we get some really, really cool moments. That one,

303
00:13:56.891 --> 00:14:00.340
he's not really scared of the idea of finding a Kryptonian so much as he's

304
00:14:00.341 --> 00:14:01.720
worried about what it means, right?

305
00:14:01.721 --> 00:14:04.030
The Superman embodies hope more so than that.

306
00:14:04.230 --> 00:14:07.780
This Superman could take out all the Atlantean and all the Amazons on his own.

307
00:14:07.810 --> 00:14:09.340
Right? And you get even goes as far as to say,

308
00:14:09.370 --> 00:14:12.790
wonder woman and Aquaman just don't come close to the power of Superman here.

309
00:14:12.820 --> 00:14:15.940
The other part of that is that Superman can hit him from any direction.

310
00:14:15.970 --> 00:14:20.350
Unlike Barry Allen, who is like a, a Bishop on a chess board, right. Or a Rook,

311
00:14:20.380 --> 00:14:23.620
he's not confined to moving in one singular direction, right?

312
00:14:23.621 --> 00:14:27.050
It's not like diagonal or, or side-by-side, you know, horizontal or,

313
00:14:27.051 --> 00:14:30.790
or a vertical only, he's like a queen piece. He can move in any direction.

314
00:14:30.820 --> 00:14:34.210
And so fighting Superman means fighting in a three-dimensional space because he

315
00:14:34.220 --> 00:14:36.940
can come from any direction, top to bottom left to right.

316
00:14:36.941 --> 00:14:39.580
And any variation in between. And so, because of that,

317
00:14:39.970 --> 00:14:42.790
e-board fawn is constantly on his guard, but then it goes as far as to say,

318
00:14:42.850 --> 00:14:45.250
if Superman lands one punch on e-board fawn,

319
00:14:45.310 --> 00:14:47.830
that'll be enough to take him out fast. And so, because of that,

320
00:14:47.831 --> 00:14:51.010
it's really just bobbing and weaving it's dodging as best he can.

321
00:14:51.050 --> 00:14:53.570
He does pick up on these small little moments, for example,

322
00:14:53.571 --> 00:14:55.850
when Suzanne uses heat vision that has high frequency,

323
00:14:56.570 --> 00:14:58.790
high-frequency photons shooting at light speed for the Superman,

324
00:14:58.850 --> 00:14:59.750
can't really aim.

325
00:14:59.870 --> 00:15:02.990
And it's kind of an interesting concept because it really begs the question when

326
00:15:02.991 --> 00:15:05.900
Superman fires off heat vision, can he accurately aim?

327
00:15:05.901 --> 00:15:10.010
Which is to say that if he sees you in point a and then you move to point B,

328
00:15:10.040 --> 00:15:12.950
can you successfully track you? And the assumptions always been yes,

329
00:15:12.980 --> 00:15:14.960
because this is always kind of how we've seen it play out.

330
00:15:14.990 --> 00:15:16.130
But when you give it some thought,

331
00:15:16.190 --> 00:15:19.460
the question is he really can he see through his heat vision to follow you?

332
00:15:19.550 --> 00:15:22.670
What is that really how that works? I don't know, but I feel like it'd be,

333
00:15:22.671 --> 00:15:25.310
it makes Superman a lot more interesting if he couldn't write,

334
00:15:25.430 --> 00:15:28.280
if he was really just guessing, but it is a cool concept. It's on,

335
00:15:28.310 --> 00:15:31.190
I'm curious post down in the common section, what you guys think, right.

336
00:15:31.220 --> 00:15:35.420
Should Superman legitimately be able to track somebody while he's using his heat

337
00:15:35.421 --> 00:15:39.410
vision or should the heat vision obscure his ability to see and keep him from

338
00:15:39.411 --> 00:15:41.210
being able to track somebody with his eyesight?

339
00:15:41.240 --> 00:15:44.420
Let me know when you guys think down there, but, uh, nonetheless the plan here,

340
00:15:44.450 --> 00:15:48.050
what's not so much for Superman to kill. ELR thought that was not the plan.

341
00:15:48.110 --> 00:15:52.220
The plan was for Superman to move [inaudible] to a particular location.

342
00:15:52.280 --> 00:15:55.610
And the reason for that is because what Batman and what, uh,

343
00:15:55.640 --> 00:15:58.340
what cyborg have done is they basically set up Sonics.

344
00:15:58.370 --> 00:16:00.860
And the idea is to effectively defeat, uh,

345
00:16:00.861 --> 00:16:04.490
defeat [inaudible] by using ultrasonics. That's basically what it is, right?

346
00:16:04.491 --> 00:16:05.840
To literally use sound,

347
00:16:05.870 --> 00:16:08.960
to kind of encase him and to control him and to sort of keep him locked off.

348
00:16:08.990 --> 00:16:12.110
Now, the other part of that is that Batman goes to pull a gun, right,

349
00:16:12.111 --> 00:16:15.620
and goes to fire a shot. But the response is cyborg is no. We made an a,

350
00:16:15.650 --> 00:16:19.040
we made a deal with Superman that we were not going to kill Ybarra thought.

351
00:16:19.070 --> 00:16:22.520
And we're Batman is almost incapacitated for a moment. He takes out cyborg.

352
00:16:22.580 --> 00:16:26.540
And then his whole stance is EMR. Thorn was never my target. I want my son.

353
00:16:26.600 --> 00:16:29.600
And so he fires off a shot and he basically says like his whole stance here,

354
00:16:29.840 --> 00:16:34.010
what Sue effectively convinced EMR or get ear by thorn to know that Batman could

355
00:16:34.011 --> 00:16:35.840
kill, right? The Batman could actually take them out,

356
00:16:35.990 --> 00:16:38.930
but orchestrating this plan that Batman could kill EMR thong.

357
00:16:38.990 --> 00:16:42.620
And the only way that EMR bond is going to have to spend his days not worrying,

358
00:16:42.621 --> 00:16:44.660
you know, not looking over his shoulder, worrying is today.

359
00:16:44.660 --> 00:16:47.750
The day the Batman takes me out is to give him the world that he wants to give

360
00:16:47.840 --> 00:16:51.200
him a world where his son exists, where Bruce Wayne was safe. And that's,

361
00:16:51.320 --> 00:16:54.560
what's kind of bonkers because what you end up also getting here is Batman

362
00:16:54.950 --> 00:16:58.130
basically revealing that it was never his intention to actually kill you.

363
00:16:58.370 --> 00:17:00.500
Bart thought it was his intention to kill Superman.

364
00:17:00.580 --> 00:17:04.730
And so he grabs a kryptonite bullet and fires it off, kill Superman on the spot.

365
00:17:04.820 --> 00:17:08.210
Right. And then just says like EMR thrawn, it's time for you to do your thing,

366
00:17:08.240 --> 00:17:11.810
right? Like while that's happening, you have the ships of like the Amazons.

367
00:17:11.870 --> 00:17:14.810
And like, like, like the invisible ships, like Amazon's in Atlanta,

368
00:17:14.840 --> 00:17:17.360
but just come flooding into this whole location.

369
00:17:17.390 --> 00:17:19.330
And you ended up finding out that with EMR fond,

370
00:17:19.331 --> 00:17:22.550
doing what he did by showing up on the doorstep of wonder woman with the body of

371
00:17:22.820 --> 00:17:24.650
Alco man dropping it off and saying, don't come here.

372
00:17:24.860 --> 00:17:26.990
But what he actually did is he United them. Right.

373
00:17:26.991 --> 00:17:29.750
He killed the King of the Atlanteans dropped their body off at wonder woman.

374
00:17:29.780 --> 00:17:34.000
And by doing that, the Atlanteans now work alongside the Amazonians, right? The,

375
00:17:34.160 --> 00:17:35.600
the Amazons. And so, because that,

376
00:17:35.720 --> 00:17:39.560
they're a singular unified force numbering in the millions. Right? And they go,

377
00:17:39.561 --> 00:17:40.580
as far as to say, like,

378
00:17:40.610 --> 00:17:43.760
we're going to conquer the United States and understand you are right about one

379
00:17:43.761 --> 00:17:48.050
thing, the old gods are basically dead. So we made a deal with new ones,

380
00:17:48.110 --> 00:17:49.590
essentially wonder woman. And the,

381
00:17:49.591 --> 00:17:53.880
the combined Atlantean Amazon force made a deal with dark side of the new gods

382
00:17:54.000 --> 00:17:57.420
and boom tubes just start opening everywhere.

383
00:17:57.421 --> 00:18:01.800
So essentially para demons just come flooding in. It's absolutely nuts.

384
00:18:01.801 --> 00:18:04.530
Now from there, we never really get to see what happens. Instead.

385
00:18:04.650 --> 00:18:07.890
Batman tells that you're barred thought get out of here, right? Like run,

386
00:18:08.100 --> 00:18:09.390
give me the world that we agreed to. Right?

387
00:18:09.391 --> 00:18:12.390
You agreed that you would give me my son back, do that. Right? Like,

388
00:18:12.410 --> 00:18:16.110
like do that understand you're not bound by Barry Allen anymore. Right?

389
00:18:16.111 --> 00:18:17.790
It's kind of like this, this quick little voice of reason.

390
00:18:17.820 --> 00:18:19.320
You're not bound by Barry Allen anymore.

391
00:18:19.350 --> 00:18:23.550
This world can be anything you want it to be right. This world is 100% yours,

392
00:18:23.551 --> 00:18:26.670
right? It's it's 100% yours. Like it doesn't belong to anybody else.

393
00:18:26.700 --> 00:18:29.310
And in that moment, EMR, thrawn realizes yes,

394
00:18:29.311 --> 00:18:32.940
it is his ability to manipulate time to travel back and forth through time

395
00:18:33.030 --> 00:18:36.090
basically means he can remake this world in any number of ways.

396
00:18:36.120 --> 00:18:38.850
EMR thought effectively becomes God. And that's,

397
00:18:38.851 --> 00:18:42.060
what's kind of crazy is the world changes based on what he wants,

398
00:18:42.180 --> 00:18:45.810
but he can travel 30 years into the past and maybe like save the life of Bruce

399
00:18:45.811 --> 00:18:47.820
Wayne, getting in trouble 30 years into the past again.

400
00:18:47.880 --> 00:18:50.730
And maybe only Martha Wayne dies and Bruce and Thomas survive.

401
00:18:50.790 --> 00:18:52.680
Then he travels into 30 years in the past again.

402
00:18:52.710 --> 00:18:56.370
And then maybe it's just like Bruce and Thomas who die in Martha Wayne survives.

403
00:18:56.371 --> 00:18:57.540
Right. Does she become that woman?

404
00:18:57.570 --> 00:19:00.420
Take that concept and just extrapolate it across the board, right?

405
00:19:00.450 --> 00:19:04.200
Any actor who's ever seen that's entertaining can become president of the United

406
00:19:04.200 --> 00:19:06.030
States. Maybe he makes himself president for a little while.

407
00:19:06.060 --> 00:19:09.330
Maybe he kinda messes things up and just sees what it's like when like wonder

408
00:19:09.331 --> 00:19:10.111
woman in dark side,

409
00:19:10.111 --> 00:19:13.380
fight to the death on earth and just engineer's things to happen. That way.

410
00:19:13.410 --> 00:19:17.460
There's no limit to the possibilities of what [inaudible] can make out of the

411
00:19:17.461 --> 00:19:17.760
earth.

412
00:19:17.760 --> 00:19:21.300
And that's why we don't get a definitive ending to what this earth will look

413
00:19:21.301 --> 00:19:23.160
like when EMR fond runs through time.

414
00:19:23.190 --> 00:19:26.370
Because the possibilities of what the earth can look like, have no limits,

415
00:19:26.430 --> 00:19:28.110
right? There's no telling what could happen.

416
00:19:28.180 --> 00:19:30.390
And pretty much as we're told here any,

417
00:19:30.391 --> 00:19:32.790
and all those possibilities will come to fruition,

418
00:19:32.820 --> 00:19:35.220
they will actually take place. But regardless,

419
00:19:35.310 --> 00:19:37.470
the world now belongs to [inaudible].

420
00:19:37.500 --> 00:19:41.040
This dark multi-verse world belongs completely and totally to him.

421
00:19:41.100 --> 00:19:44.940
Now what's really interesting here is that there is basically a dark multi-verse

422
00:19:45.300 --> 00:19:45.810
EMR fond now.

423
00:19:45.810 --> 00:19:48.600
So what I'm curious to see is how they're going to change that character,

424
00:19:48.630 --> 00:19:50.400
what they're going to do with him. But with that being said, guys,

425
00:19:50.460 --> 00:19:51.510
we're gonna bring this video to an end.

426
00:19:51.570 --> 00:19:54.030
If you are new here to come as explained to make sure you guys have the sub

427
00:19:54.031 --> 00:19:56.280
button to become part of the Rob port. Do you guys enjoy this video?

428
00:19:56.310 --> 00:19:58.860
Make sure you drop a like, and I will catch you all later.
